01:15.881 --> 01:17.915
I think he knows.

01:19.384 --> 01:23.086
No, he doesn't know. He can't.

01:23.121 --> 01:26.055
By the time he figures out
we're not coming back,

01:26.090 --> 01:28.224
we'll be long gone.

01:36.633 --> 01:38.634
Hey.

01:40.903 --> 01:43.238
We risk our lives
every time we steal for him.

01:45.274 --> 01:47.274
Why not risk our lives for us?

01:47.309 --> 01:50.677
No one's ever
stolen from Rabbit.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.547
He doesn't know.

02:04.957 --> 02:07.692
Everything will be fine.

03:33.512 --> 03:35.848
Are we back
on track, Mr. Hanson?

03:35.882 --> 03:38.384
We're still playing catch-up after
that power failure yesterday,

03:38.419 --> 03:41.454
but I'll keep them late and we
should be caught up by Sunday.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.891
Friday.

03:46.628 --> 03:49.664
Okay. Friday. I'm on it.

03:53.102 --> 03:55.603
Oh, I'm on it, motherfucker.

04:27.741 --> 04:29.976
Get down here.

04:44.626 --> 04:47.429
You know for a fact
the Yoders are out of town?

04:47.463 --> 04:49.632
Yeah. Away till Tuesday.

04:49.666 --> 04:51.767
Okay.

05:04.048 --> 05:06.283
Get out of here.

05:12.592 --> 05:14.727
- Good to go, boys.
- All right.

05:14.761 --> 05:16.829
<i>It's an original masonry house.</i>

05:16.897 --> 05:18.264
All the houses
in this neighborhood

05:18.298 --> 05:21.267
came up in the late 1920s.

05:21.301 --> 05:23.268
If you wanted to paint
over this green in here.

05:23.303 --> 05:26.305
- But I'll be here...
- Excuse me just a moment.

05:26.339 --> 05:28.140
Mrs. Hopewell, good morning.

05:28.174 --> 05:29.908
What are you doing here?

05:29.943 --> 05:32.210
Same as everyone else.

05:32.245 --> 05:34.747
I'm looking to put down roots.

05:34.781 --> 05:37.616
This room has great
morning light.

05:38.785 --> 05:40.887
Would you like
to see the kitchen?

05:40.921 --> 05:42.822
Sure.

05:45.393 --> 05:47.294
What the fuck are you doing?

06:03.214 --> 06:06.283
- You've been training.
- What the fuck are you doing?

06:06.351 --> 06:08.018
This is my life.

06:08.053 --> 06:10.421
- Ana.
- My name is Carrie.

06:10.456 --> 06:13.525
Either way, I still love you.

06:17.229 --> 06:20.965
If that's true, then you'll
leave here and never come back.

06:22.301 --> 06:24.536
<i>Carrie?</i>

06:26.106 --> 06:29.041
Um, your phone.

06:29.075 --> 06:32.111
Shit! Okay. Hello?

06:35.048 --> 06:36.415
Nice kitchen.

06:36.449 --> 06:38.584
<i>Mrs. Hopewell,</i>
<i>this is Principal Merrick.</i>

06:38.618 --> 06:40.170
<i>I'm calling to let
you know that Deva</i>

06:40.171 --> 06:41.721
<i>is not in school
again this morning.</i>

06:41.755 --> 06:44.090
<i>I wanted to check</i>
<i>if she was feeling ill.</i>

06:44.125 --> 06:46.026
No, no, she's not,

06:46.060 --> 06:47.895
but I can assure you
she's going to be.

06:47.930 --> 06:50.765
<i>I hope she's okay.</i>
<i>Please let us know. Thanks.</i>

06:58.473 --> 07:00.541
<i>Hey, it's Deva.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

07:00.576 --> 07:02.477
<i>Or don't.</i>

07:02.511 --> 07:03.945
Deva, where are you?

07:05.581 --> 07:07.649
<i>♪ You're so, so fine ♪</i>

07:07.683 --> 07:11.654
<i>♪ Even when you're dropping,</i>
<i>you're down like a man ♪</i>

07:13.356 --> 07:16.658
<i>♪ I know you're just a boy,</i>
<i>but I could hardly tell ♪</i>

07:16.692 --> 07:19.260
<i>♪ And no one really cares. ♪</i>

07:22.531 --> 07:24.632
Whoo!

07:39.783 --> 07:41.917
<i>How's it going?</i>

07:56.466 --> 07:58.802
<i>Yo, man. Are we putting
the Skulls with these?</i>

07:58.836 --> 08:01.504
<i>- Just sort it and show me.</i>
- Reed?

08:05.443 --> 08:07.777
- Hey, Hanson.
- Hey, Reed.

08:07.812 --> 08:09.112
Who the fuck are they?

08:09.180 --> 08:10.780
It's okay. They're cool.

08:10.815 --> 08:12.915
Move.

08:14.685 --> 08:19.188
Well, come here, cool girls.

08:36.408 --> 08:38.643
Go on.

08:53.993 --> 08:57.896
<i>You ask and Arno delivers.</i>

08:57.931 --> 08:59.798
The Red Skull stamp
as promised.

08:59.832 --> 09:02.567
Pretty sweet, huh?

09:02.602 --> 09:04.102
Now if we can just
settle up our account...

09:04.137 --> 09:05.804
- Hey.
- Ah! Ow, man!

09:05.838 --> 09:08.306
Hey, fuckhead, you got high
while you're working for me?

09:08.340 --> 09:11.610
- Are you fucking crazy?
- No way, man. I'm a professional.

09:11.644 --> 09:14.012
<i>So you're not
tripping right now?</i>

09:14.047 --> 09:15.380
I'm straight, man.

09:15.415 --> 09:17.716
Look at me.

09:24.323 --> 09:26.358
Fucking tweaker.
Get him out of here.

09:26.392 --> 09:28.861
Move it.

09:28.895 --> 09:31.397
Fuck you, motherfucker!
I'm gonna kick your ass.

09:31.431 --> 09:33.933
- Fuck you.
- Yo, chill out, man. Get off of me.

09:33.967 --> 09:36.269
<i>Fuck off! Go!</i>

09:42.142 --> 09:43.843
Come here.

09:47.882 --> 09:49.649
Come here.

10:41.937 --> 10:44.071
Are you cool?

10:50.579 --> 10:52.246
What is it?

10:52.281 --> 10:54.682
Some of the pills aren't pure.

10:54.716 --> 10:56.517
- There's caffeine in them.
- You know what?

10:56.551 --> 10:58.252
How about you leave
the chemistry to me

10:58.286 --> 11:00.788
and just go back
and make the fucking pills?

11:10.433 --> 11:11.800
What's going on?

11:21.144 --> 11:23.079
You're in.

11:28.185 --> 11:30.219
Midnight tomorrow
at Yoder's barn.

11:30.254 --> 11:33.089
- You know it?
- Yeah.

11:35.494 --> 11:38.029
And you girls will
spread the word, right?

11:38.063 --> 11:40.664
Hells yeah, we will.

11:43.101 --> 11:44.669
Let's go, Deva.

11:52.979 --> 11:55.547
- Hey.
- Sheriff.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.152
You're late.

11:59.186 --> 12:00.687
What, do I need
a note from home?

12:00.721 --> 12:02.155
Couldn't reach you
on your radio.

12:02.190 --> 12:03.756
I'm here now. What do you need?

12:03.791 --> 12:05.258
What I need, what we need,

12:05.293 --> 12:06.827
is a sheriff
that answers his radio.

12:06.861 --> 12:09.029
All right?

12:09.063 --> 12:10.464
I'll take that
under advisement.

12:10.498 --> 12:12.566
Look, I don't know how
you did things in Oregon...

12:12.601 --> 12:14.936
- Shut up, Brock.
- <i>What?</i>

12:14.970 --> 12:18.740
- What the hell did you just say to me?
- I won't tell you twice.

12:28.718 --> 12:30.786
Mr. Proctor.

12:32.589 --> 12:34.590
<i>There he is.</i>

12:34.624 --> 12:36.592
That looks painful.

12:36.660 --> 12:38.027
I'll survive.

12:38.061 --> 12:40.729
May I have a word in private?

12:51.775 --> 12:54.176
Kobe steaks. My best.

12:54.244 --> 12:55.944
Thank you.

12:55.979 --> 12:57.846
Well, you saved my life.

12:57.881 --> 13:00.015
I was just doing my job.

13:02.252 --> 13:05.121
<i>I'm sure by now you've</i>
<i>gleaned that there are people</i>

13:05.155 --> 13:07.523
in Banshee,
our young mayor among them,

13:07.558 --> 13:09.959
who would have been happy
to see me go down.

13:11.563 --> 13:12.964
Yeah, why is that?

13:12.998 --> 13:14.499
Oh...

13:14.533 --> 13:17.769
some people find my business
practices a little aggressive.

13:17.803 --> 13:19.771
I don't deny it.

13:19.805 --> 13:22.040
Not everyone shares
my vision for this town.

13:22.075 --> 13:24.710
But that's a talk
for another time.

13:24.744 --> 13:29.147
The reason I stopped in is to warn
you about the Moody brothers.

13:29.182 --> 13:31.116
Warn me?

13:31.150 --> 13:34.085
Yeah, they might be swimming in
the shallow end of the gene pool,

13:34.120 --> 13:36.122
but they're a fiercely
loyal clan.

13:36.156 --> 13:38.692
Been in this town
almost as long as my people.

13:38.726 --> 13:40.427
And they will be out for blood.

13:41.762 --> 13:43.896
I'll keep my eye out.

13:45.065 --> 13:47.634
Sheriff, I wouldn't
be bothering you

13:47.668 --> 13:50.537
if I didn't think you have a
serious problem on your hands.

13:50.571 --> 13:52.105
I don't deny your abilities.

13:52.139 --> 13:55.608
It's just that your hands
are tied by this office,

13:55.642 --> 13:59.280
whereas I have a talent
for resolving problems

13:59.314 --> 14:01.649
like this one quietly.

14:05.353 --> 14:08.022
I appreciate your concern,

14:08.056 --> 14:10.791
but...

14:10.826 --> 14:13.929
I think I'll just take
things as they come.

14:16.265 --> 14:19.567
It could be that I'm speaking
globally here, Sheriff,

14:19.601 --> 14:22.136
beyond the Moody situation.

14:22.171 --> 14:25.507
You see, I've got a good number
of local business interests

14:25.574 --> 14:28.042
that need to be kept
running smoothly.

14:28.077 --> 14:31.446
These interests can occasionally
generate difficulties,

14:31.480 --> 14:35.315
but they also
generate revenues.

14:35.350 --> 14:37.684
Significant revenues.

14:39.053 --> 14:41.855
What do you want, Mr. Proctor?

14:43.225 --> 14:46.696
I might ask you the same
question, Sheriff Hood.

14:52.836 --> 14:55.038
I'm good.

14:58.242 --> 15:00.643
But thank you.

15:07.752 --> 15:10.020
You take care of that.

15:10.054 --> 15:13.491
It could go bad pretty fast.

15:50.562 --> 15:52.630
- Where's my fucking money?
<i>- You'll get it.</i>

15:52.664 --> 15:55.499
- Where'd you land?
- <i>In hell.</i>

15:55.533 --> 15:58.736
Do you have any idea
what I'm surrounded by?

15:58.804 --> 16:00.705
Skee-fucking-Ball,

16:00.739 --> 16:02.406
cotton-fucking-candy,

16:02.441 --> 16:04.976
and sea-fucking-gulls.

16:05.010 --> 16:07.845
Is that a cape?

16:07.880 --> 16:11.316
This is Diane von
Furstenberg, chica.

16:11.350 --> 16:13.083
Shoo. Go get pregnant.

16:15.554 --> 16:19.156
- So?
- <i>Bitch, you got lucky on this one.</i>

16:19.191 --> 16:23.128
Lucas Hood had virtually
no living relatives,

16:23.163 --> 16:25.597
an estranged ex-wife
and son he ain't seen in years.

16:25.632 --> 16:27.866
<i>I couldn't even find</i>
<i>any close friends.</i>

16:27.901 --> 16:29.802
And he ain't into
the grid, neither.

16:29.836 --> 16:31.570
No Facebook, no Twitter.

16:31.604 --> 16:34.039
Your cover is good for now.

16:34.107 --> 16:36.241
<i>Except...</i>

16:36.276 --> 16:37.743
Except what?

16:37.778 --> 16:39.512
Except that being where you are

16:39.546 --> 16:42.448
makes you the dumbest
bitch that I know!

16:42.483 --> 16:44.617
Oh, not you, Snooki.

16:47.989 --> 16:52.160
So, how's she look?

16:55.064 --> 16:57.131
She looks good.

17:47.652 --> 17:49.753
Hold it!

17:50.989 --> 17:53.657
Sorry, it's been
that kind of week.

17:53.692 --> 17:56.160
- You okay?
- Yeah.

17:56.194 --> 17:58.095
Then let's have some fun.

18:09.709 --> 18:12.477
You and your Hula Poppers.

18:12.512 --> 18:15.447
If you're after serious game,
you'd better come ready.

18:15.481 --> 18:17.049
Live bait is the way to go.

18:17.083 --> 18:20.185
Nah. I've been winning
fishing derbies

18:20.220 --> 18:22.956
since you were
a speck of sperm.

18:22.990 --> 18:26.593
I hear you have the new sheriff
living over your garage.

18:28.195 --> 18:32.232
Huh? Seems kind of strange for
an ex-con renting to a lawman.

18:34.035 --> 18:36.469
Doesn't it bother you?

18:36.504 --> 18:40.073
Apparently not as much
as it bothers you.

18:40.107 --> 18:43.977
At some point, I might begin
to question your loyalty.

18:45.646 --> 18:49.850
No, I'm just
a broken-down ex-con.

18:49.885 --> 18:52.754
I don't choose sides.

18:55.458 --> 18:57.859
Kai.

18:57.893 --> 19:01.796
You talk about serious game?

19:01.830 --> 19:04.599
Hood is serious game.

19:04.667 --> 19:06.668
<i>Like you've never seen.</i>

19:06.703 --> 19:10.339
So if you come for him,
you'd better come ready.

19:14.745 --> 19:16.946
Take care of yourself, Sugar.

19:18.015 --> 19:19.916
Yeah, you, too.

19:31.962 --> 19:35.132
No, no, no. You can't
be here tonight.

19:35.200 --> 19:37.168
And yet I am.

19:37.202 --> 19:38.703
Cole Moody's wake.

19:38.737 --> 19:41.372
<i>His brothers</i>
<i>are drunker than usual,</i>

19:41.406 --> 19:42.874
if that's possible.

19:42.908 --> 19:44.408
Now, we've already
had two fistfights.

19:44.443 --> 19:46.110
That's just between
family members.

19:46.144 --> 19:48.513
Can I at least get a sandwich?
Hey.

19:48.547 --> 19:50.582
All right.

19:50.616 --> 19:52.751
All right, just...

19:55.521 --> 19:57.355
Whatever it takes
to get you out of here.

19:57.390 --> 19:58.991
Look, here. Come on, take 'em.

19:59.026 --> 20:02.228
Come on, eat 'em. Plenty
more where that came from.

20:02.263 --> 20:04.196
Come on.

20:04.231 --> 20:06.532
All right?

20:35.361 --> 20:37.562
Sheriff Hood.

20:37.596 --> 20:39.697
Yeah?

20:42.668 --> 20:44.703
You don't know
who I am, do you?

20:44.737 --> 20:46.272
Not yet.

20:46.306 --> 20:48.707
I'm Kat Moody.

20:48.742 --> 20:50.443
You killed my husband.

20:50.477 --> 20:53.479
And now you're
sitting here eating food

20:53.513 --> 20:56.616
prepared for his wake,
food that I paid for.

20:59.053 --> 21:02.289
Well, I apologize
about the food.

21:02.323 --> 21:05.058
That was in bad taste.

21:05.093 --> 21:07.895
But not for killing my husband?

21:11.468 --> 21:14.070
He smashed me
in the head with a pipe

21:14.104 --> 21:16.138
and then fired a gun
at a crowded party.

21:16.173 --> 21:19.508
So, while I am sorry
for your grief...

21:22.579 --> 21:25.514
He laid a good one on you.

21:25.581 --> 21:27.382
He did.

21:31.921 --> 21:34.155
You're the second
woman to hit me today.

21:34.189 --> 21:35.958
I bet that's
a slow day for you.

21:35.992 --> 21:38.360
Mmm.

21:38.394 --> 21:41.563
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>
<i>Marcus, Dex, put those away.</i>

21:41.598 --> 21:43.532
Shut up, Kat, and get inside.

21:43.566 --> 21:47.336
You Moody boys sure do
like your six-shooters.

21:47.370 --> 21:49.404
You got permits for those?

21:49.439 --> 21:51.240
You won't be around
long enough to find out.

21:51.274 --> 21:53.108
You're not gonna shoot a man
at your brother's wake.

21:53.143 --> 21:54.576
What the hell
is wrong with you?

21:54.611 --> 21:56.378
We're doing this for Cole.

21:56.412 --> 21:58.648
Cole was a mean drunk
and he got what was coming.

21:58.682 --> 22:00.717
You watch your mouth, bitch.
I'll kill you, too.

22:00.751 --> 22:03.553
Hey, you're Marcus, right?
And you're Dex?

22:03.587 --> 22:05.088
That's right.

22:05.122 --> 22:07.857
Okay, Marcus, Dex,

22:07.892 --> 22:10.760
- you have the right to remain silent.
- That's far enough.

22:10.795 --> 22:13.363
Anything you do say can be used
against you in a court of law.

22:13.397 --> 22:15.799
- You believe the balls on this guy?
- He thinks he's arresting us.

22:15.833 --> 22:18.034
- You have the right to an attorney.
- Shut the fuck up.

22:18.069 --> 22:20.070
Why don't you make me?

22:21.005 --> 22:23.007
Come on.

22:26.545 --> 22:28.879
Marcus, Dex,

22:28.914 --> 22:31.048
your coffee is getting cold.

22:31.083 --> 22:33.351
This don't concern you, Sugar.

22:33.385 --> 22:36.120
All the same, I am concerned.

22:36.155 --> 22:38.823
Come on.

22:43.662 --> 22:45.863
Hmm?

22:49.034 --> 22:51.503
If you can't afford
an attorney,

22:51.537 --> 22:54.672
the court will appoint one for
you, and he'll probably suck.

22:54.706 --> 22:57.541
Sheriff Hood, they're drunk
and they're morons,

22:57.576 --> 22:59.843
but they're grieving
in their own way.

23:07.085 --> 23:09.920
Get the fuck out of here.

23:11.323 --> 23:13.424
Go on.

23:15.561 --> 23:18.529
This isn't over, Hood.
We'll be looking out for you.

23:18.564 --> 23:21.066
Well, I'll be the one in the
car with the flashing lights.

23:27.740 --> 23:30.042
What the fuck
are you looking at?

23:37.852 --> 23:39.452
And you are?

25:42.552 --> 25:44.152
Let's go.

25:45.854 --> 25:48.690
Hey, stick to the trees for at
least two miles. You'll be fine.

25:48.724 --> 25:50.158
What are you talking about?
Where are you going?

25:50.192 --> 25:52.227
- I'm gonna throw them off.
- No, I'm not leaving you!

25:52.261 --> 25:53.795
Listen to me.
You were right about Rabbit.

25:53.829 --> 25:56.030
- He knew. He knew.
- Don't do this.

25:56.064 --> 25:58.267
Don't do this. Don't do this.
We can make it.

25:58.301 --> 25:59.935
Hey, hey! I'll catch up to you.

25:59.969 --> 26:02.237
I love you. I love you.

26:02.272 --> 26:04.573
Take the diamonds.

26:04.608 --> 26:06.909
I'll catch up to you.

26:06.943 --> 26:08.510
Go!

26:09.979 --> 26:11.413
<i>Right there!</i>

26:11.447 --> 26:13.715
<i>No! I got you!</i>

26:13.749 --> 26:15.350
- <i>Stay right where you are.</i>

26:15.351 --> 26:16.951
<i>Get down
on the ground right now.</i>

26:16.985 --> 26:19.988
Right there. Hands up. Don't do it...

26:20.022 --> 26:21.990
Come on.

26:22.024 --> 26:24.027
Copy. We got him.

26:29.567 --> 26:31.502
Baby!

26:35.708 --> 26:37.842
Hey.

26:39.779 --> 26:41.780
You okay, baby?

26:41.814 --> 26:43.949
Yeah.

26:48.856 --> 26:50.957
Just a bad dream.

27:04.906 --> 27:06.974
Is that the Moody report?

27:08.076 --> 27:09.544
Yeah.

27:09.578 --> 27:11.413
It's supposed to be.

27:14.284 --> 27:16.452
But if I had known
there was all this paperwork,

27:16.486 --> 27:18.287
I never would have shot him.

27:18.355 --> 27:21.189
Aw, come on, you must have had
to do this back in Oregon.

27:21.224 --> 27:24.192
Uh, yeah, I wasn't
any better at it then.

27:25.461 --> 27:27.963
You filled out
the incident report twice.

27:27.997 --> 27:30.198
And you have to attach it
to the SO sheet.

27:31.334 --> 27:34.970
- SO?
- State oversight.

27:35.005 --> 27:38.841
Have you already done
the weapons discharge form?

27:46.582 --> 27:48.784
Uh, you know,

27:48.818 --> 27:52.588
Sheriff Morgan used to have
Alma do all this stuff for him.

27:52.622 --> 27:55.324
She enjoys it. Just buy her
a nice bottle of wine.

27:55.358 --> 27:58.059
Look it over when she's done.

27:59.429 --> 28:01.163
Sold.

28:07.237 --> 28:09.638
You gave us your word that
you'd stop ditching school.

28:09.672 --> 28:11.707
- My grades are fine.
- That is not the point.

28:11.741 --> 28:13.642
<i>So where were
you this afternoon?</i>

28:13.676 --> 28:15.877
What's the difference?
It's Saturday.

28:15.912 --> 28:18.780
- My grades are fine, too.
- Rock on, Max.

28:18.814 --> 28:22.318
Deva, this isn't a joke. Your
mother and I are worried about you.

28:22.352 --> 28:24.086
Well, there's nothing
to be worried about.

28:24.121 --> 28:26.923
- Okay?
- That's not what it looks like.

28:26.957 --> 28:28.991
What...

28:29.026 --> 28:30.626
Well, that went well.

28:30.661 --> 28:33.696
I just... I can't do this right now.

28:35.732 --> 28:38.901
Hey, we are not finished.

28:39.803 --> 28:41.203
Women, right?

28:41.238 --> 28:43.672
You little...

28:45.575 --> 28:47.411
- Dad...

28:47.412 --> 28:49.246
- If you turn into a
teenager, I will kill you.

29:19.414 --> 29:21.515
- Mr. Bowman.
- Deputy Brock.

29:21.550 --> 29:23.217
What can we do for you?

29:23.251 --> 29:25.853
- You are the new sheriff?
- That's right.

29:25.887 --> 29:28.656
Something is happening
at the Yoder farm tonight.

29:28.691 --> 29:30.324
Some kind of a barn party.

29:30.359 --> 29:32.460
- A rave?
- Yes.

29:32.494 --> 29:35.231
My son used that word.
He saw them setting it up.

29:35.265 --> 29:37.833
A rave in this town?

29:37.867 --> 29:40.069
Emmett.

29:40.103 --> 29:42.939
Yeah, thank you for coming in.

29:47.578 --> 29:52.182
Sheriff, you'll keep my
family's name out of this?

29:52.217 --> 29:54.218
Yeah, you were never here.

29:54.252 --> 29:56.520
Thank you.

29:56.554 --> 29:59.824
My daughter Rebecca.

30:08.367 --> 30:11.103
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Sheriff Hood.

30:11.137 --> 30:12.772
Very nice to meet you.

30:14.341 --> 30:16.008
You, too.

30:16.042 --> 30:19.111
<i>Rebecca, get in.</i>

30:36.598 --> 30:38.966
What's going on?

30:39.000 --> 30:40.467
<i>Are we going to war?</i>

30:40.501 --> 30:42.770
These raves are highly
organized enterprises.

30:42.804 --> 30:46.006
It's designed for the sole
purpose of selling drugs.

30:46.040 --> 30:49.277
And where there are drugs,
there will be guns.

30:49.311 --> 30:51.379
Usually by the time
we hear about it,

30:51.413 --> 30:53.581
the place is trashed
and everyone is long gone.

30:53.615 --> 30:55.916
Let's go.

30:55.951 --> 30:57.585
Right?

30:59.187 --> 31:00.788
Right.

31:02.991 --> 31:06.160
Like, oh, my God.
There's so many people.

31:06.194 --> 31:08.162
We're with Hanson.
Beaty and Deva.

31:08.196 --> 31:10.365
<i>Oh, like that's gonna help?</i>

31:10.399 --> 31:14.235
- <i>Why don't you wait like everybody else?</i>
- VIPs? Nice.

31:23.645 --> 31:24.912
Hey, Hanson!

31:24.946 --> 31:26.646
Yeah, police band all quiet?

31:26.681 --> 31:28.815
Okay, people, let's get paid.

32:07.724 --> 32:10.527
- Hey!
- You made it. Hey.

32:10.561 --> 32:12.929
What's up? Oh, my God.

32:12.963 --> 32:15.898
- Snacks, anyone?
- Oh, Skulls!

32:15.933 --> 32:18.568
- What is it?
- It's E.

32:41.460 --> 32:43.127
Whoo!

32:52.572 --> 32:54.439
Hey, baby.

32:54.474 --> 32:56.308
You okay?

32:56.342 --> 32:58.443
- Yeah.
- Okay.

33:11.058 --> 33:12.658
Deva.

33:14.461 --> 33:16.195
Deva.

33:16.230 --> 33:19.065
Deva!

33:21.736 --> 33:24.204
Deva.

33:31.813 --> 33:35.349
<i>♪ Psychotic, it's psychotic,</i>
<i>psychotic, it's psychotic ♪</i>

33:35.384 --> 33:39.287
<i>♪ Psychotic, it's psychotic,
psychotic, it's psychotic ♪</i>

33:39.321 --> 33:42.890
<i>♪ Psychotic, it's psychotic,</i>
<i>psychotic, it's psychotic ♪</i>

33:42.924 --> 33:46.359
<i>♪ Psychotic, psychotic,</i>
<i>psychotic... ♪</i>

34:06.848 --> 34:08.248
So what's the plan?

34:08.283 --> 34:11.284
All right, there's only two
ways in and out of here...

34:11.319 --> 34:14.721
that front entrance and then there's
a utility door around back.

34:14.755 --> 34:16.723
Should be pretty easy
for us to cover.

34:16.757 --> 34:19.759
Yeah, but God only knows how
many kids are actually in there.

34:19.793 --> 34:21.327
Start a panic,

34:21.362 --> 34:24.031
this thing could go
from bad to worse fast.

34:24.065 --> 34:25.533
What are you doing?

34:25.567 --> 34:27.601
We need to see inside.

34:27.636 --> 34:29.570
If I can find
the guy in charge,

34:29.603 --> 34:32.873
we can shut this down
without starting a riot.

34:32.907 --> 34:36.243
So you're just gonna wander in
there and ask who's in charge?

34:36.277 --> 34:38.378
- That's your plan?
- Yeah.

34:38.413 --> 34:40.847
Oh, great.

34:40.882 --> 34:43.483
Aren't you kind of old
to pass for a teenager?

34:43.516 --> 34:44.951
I'm young at heart.

34:44.985 --> 34:46.620
Can't be out of uniform, Hood.

34:46.655 --> 34:48.255
You are legally required
to identify yourself.

34:48.290 --> 34:49.991
Is he always this much fun?

35:02.872 --> 35:04.572
Yeah, I'm here for the rave.

35:04.607 --> 35:07.508
- There's no rave here.
- Come on, guys, what's it gonna take?

35:12.849 --> 35:15.417
Shit. Are you kidding me?

35:17.119 --> 35:19.921
He can't... he can't
just do that, right?

35:25.595 --> 35:29.032
- He's waving.
- Yeah.

35:29.066 --> 35:31.000
What do we do?

35:39.044 --> 35:41.279
<i>Moore,
what's your count on the gate?</i>

35:56.129 --> 36:00.033
<i>Moore, are you hearing me?</i>
<i>I asked what's your count.</i>

36:01.770 --> 36:04.004
<i>Moore, what the fuck? Respond.</i>

36:06.508 --> 36:08.776
<i>Someone get me eyes on Moore.</i>

36:18.755 --> 36:20.923
Someone get me eyes on Moore.

36:20.958 --> 36:22.526
You got nothing?

36:34.071 --> 36:36.038
<i>Hey, it's Deva.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

36:36.073 --> 36:38.607
<i>Or don't.</i>

37:04.903 --> 37:06.504
Reed? Reed.

37:06.538 --> 37:08.940
What is it?

37:09.007 --> 37:11.109
Reed! Reed!

37:16.048 --> 37:19.717
Help! Somebody help me!

37:27.525 --> 37:29.026
Reed!

37:29.060 --> 37:30.093
Somebody...

37:30.128 --> 37:31.628
help!

37:31.663 --> 37:33.764
Please!

37:46.511 --> 37:48.512
<i>Help!</i>

37:52.717 --> 37:55.118
Something's wrong. Call the
paramedics and get in here.

37:55.153 --> 37:57.087
We've got to shut
this down fast.

38:03.129 --> 38:05.998
Everyone clear out.
It's going south.

38:07.967 --> 38:09.869
Five-O, move out now!

38:11.771 --> 38:16.042
Somebody help! Help!

38:20.014 --> 38:22.049
<i>Help!</i>

38:23.218 --> 38:25.752
- Somebody help me.
- Hey, hey, hey.

38:25.787 --> 38:28.655
Come on. Come on.

38:28.690 --> 38:30.657
Move!

38:34.295 --> 38:36.797
Look at me. Look at me.
You okay?

38:36.831 --> 38:39.566
Are you okay?

38:39.600 --> 38:42.135
<i>- Are you okay? Deva?</i>

38:44.772 --> 38:47.475
This is the BSD.

38:47.509 --> 38:50.010
Please start exiting
in an orderly fashion.

38:55.783 --> 38:58.585
You stay here. Do not move.

38:58.619 --> 39:00.353
Stay there.

39:01.756 --> 39:03.657
- Get out! Get out!
- Get out.

39:46.671 --> 39:48.639
Hey!

40:29.015 --> 40:31.717
<i>You good?</i>

40:31.751 --> 40:33.853
I'm good.

40:37.157 --> 40:39.091
- Is it charged?
- Charged.

40:40.660 --> 40:42.160
- Anything?
- No.

40:42.195 --> 40:44.196
<i>All right. Ready? Charge.</i>

40:47.601 --> 40:49.969
- No.
- <i>All right, we gotta call it.</i>

40:50.004 --> 40:51.571
No. No!

40:51.639 --> 40:55.108
No! Oh, no!

40:55.176 --> 40:58.311
Reed! No!

40:58.345 --> 41:01.481
- Oh, my God!
- Shh. It's okay.

41:01.515 --> 41:03.650
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

41:03.684 --> 41:06.820
Shh.

41:20.804 --> 41:23.439
Sit tight. Turn around.

41:25.109 --> 41:28.344
Look at this. Reed Schumacher.

41:28.378 --> 41:31.814
State Senator Schumacher,
that's his son.

41:35.988 --> 41:38.189
What the fuck are you
looking at, bitch?

41:38.257 --> 41:40.724
Hey, shut your mouth.

41:46.531 --> 41:49.266
I asked you a question, bitch...
what the fuck are you looking at?

41:50.235 --> 41:52.870
Sheriff! Sheriff! Hood!

41:52.904 --> 41:54.772
Get the fuck off me.

41:58.677 --> 42:00.244
Come on, I'll take
you both home.

42:14.194 --> 42:15.828
Hood, hey,
what the fuck was that?

42:15.862 --> 42:17.330
Hey, leave it, Brock.

42:17.364 --> 42:19.131
You just beat the shit
out of a handcuffed perp

42:19.166 --> 42:21.101
- in front of 10 witnesses.
- He had it coming.

42:21.202 --> 42:22.837
I don't know how
you did things out West,

42:22.871 --> 42:26.006
but you cannot keep making up
the rules as you go along here.

42:26.041 --> 42:29.110
All right? You're putting the rest
of us in an impossible position.

42:30.579 --> 42:31.946
Get in.

42:31.980 --> 42:33.881
And what the hell
am I supposed to do, huh?

42:33.916 --> 42:36.284
You know what?

42:36.318 --> 42:38.453
I'd seriously
consider resigning.

42:38.487 --> 42:40.388
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

42:40.423 --> 42:42.457
You know what, Sheriff?

42:42.492 --> 42:43.760
I was here long
before you and I'm

42:43.761 --> 42:45.027
gonna be here long
after you're gone,

42:45.061 --> 42:47.364
which by the looks of it,
is gonna be pretty damn soon.

42:47.399 --> 42:49.066
- Maybe.
- Mm-hmm.

42:49.100 --> 42:51.202
But right now

42:51.236 --> 42:53.538
the smartest career move
you could make

42:53.572 --> 42:56.574
would be to get
the fuck out of my way.

43:33.748 --> 43:36.050
Wait!

43:42.590 --> 43:44.024
What...

43:44.058 --> 43:47.694
You cut my fucking finger off.

43:47.762 --> 43:49.613
Our ecstasy trade
generates revenues of

43:49.614 --> 43:51.464
a quarter of a million
dollars a week

43:51.499 --> 43:53.600
in Philadelphia and DC.

43:53.634 --> 43:55.602
I spent years and serious money

43:55.636 --> 43:57.037
developing that network.

43:57.071 --> 43:59.039
And because I'm not
a fucking idiot,

43:59.074 --> 44:01.609
I never sold a single pill
in this county.

44:01.643 --> 44:04.111
I don't shit where
I sleep, Mr. Hanson.

44:04.145 --> 44:06.613
You, on the other hand, have
just taken a steaming dump

44:06.647 --> 44:08.282
right in the middle
of my fucking bed.

44:08.316 --> 44:09.783
You stole my Skulls,

44:09.851 --> 44:12.018
you cooked up a tainted
batch that killed a boy.

44:12.053 --> 44:13.620
But not just any boy.

44:13.654 --> 44:17.224
The boy of a state senator.
Do you understand?

44:17.292 --> 44:19.059
You've unleashed
a shitstorm on me.

44:19.093 --> 44:21.127
I'm sorry, Mr. Proctor.

44:24.499 --> 44:27.434
Now...

44:27.469 --> 44:30.538
I want you to look
over here at Preacher.

44:30.572 --> 44:33.040
Preacher now has
a taste for you.

44:34.743 --> 44:37.044
I'll give you 60 seconds.

44:39.348 --> 44:42.784
What? Are you fucking serious?

44:42.818 --> 44:44.919
Starting now.

44:50.560 --> 44:52.928
<i>Fass!</i>

45:04.940 --> 45:07.275
<i>Please!</i>

45:53.094 --> 45:55.762
It's a hard thing
to see someone die.

46:03.005 --> 46:07.208
First time,
I was younger than you.

46:08.911 --> 46:11.779
A kid from my neighborhood

46:11.847 --> 46:13.781
tried to run across
the railroad tracks.

46:15.216 --> 46:20.053
He tripped on
some gravel and...

46:20.121 --> 46:22.990
you know.

46:27.529 --> 46:30.197
Thing is,

46:30.231 --> 46:33.066
you can't make sense out of it.

46:33.101 --> 46:35.202
All right?

46:36.705 --> 46:39.206
It doesn't make sense.

46:41.710 --> 46:43.877
You hear me?

46:46.181 --> 46:48.216
You just...

46:50.885 --> 46:53.287
I don't know.

46:53.321 --> 46:56.423
You accept it at some point.

47:06.301 --> 47:09.136
Was he a friend of yours?

47:09.170 --> 47:11.272
The kid on the tracks?

47:14.209 --> 47:16.144
No.

47:18.547 --> 47:21.516
No, he was just some asshole
from the neighborhood.

47:23.286 --> 47:26.788
And I was another asshole who dared
him to beat the 5:15 Amtrak.

47:31.026 --> 47:33.828
Now you listen to me. Hey.

47:38.135 --> 47:40.536
You're gonna be okay.
