Well I started, he'll, you can
get instead of the fried rice,

07:52.767 --> 07:56.400
 he'll put a bed of salad with
  the chicken on top for ya.

07:56.467 --> 07:59.801
So you get a salad with grilled
  chicken for $3.50.

something a little more healthy,
less fattening,

08:19.067 --> 08:22.167

  just salad for ya.

  You don't, you don't put a
   baseball inside?

17:39.334 --> 17:42.067
  Betrothed?

17:42.133 --> 17:45.801
  Yes.  I get your joke Paul,
  you're very funny.

17:45.868 --> 17:47.868
 I'm getting another cocktail
  does anybody want anything?

17:47.934 --> 17:48.734
   I'll have a beer.

17:48.801 --> 17:49.667
  I'll have one too.

17:49.734 --> 17:50.601
Honey?

17:50.667 --> 17:51.767
   I'm good.

17:51.834 --> 17:53.334
   Do you have any singles?

17:53.400 --> 17:55.601
   What do you want it for?

17:55.667 --> 17:57.434
   Nothing.

17:57.501 --> 18:00.834
Honey, this is a formal event.
   You don't have to tip the
  bartender.

18:00.901 --> 18:03.901
Bartender didn't have a problem
   with it.

18:03.968 --> 18:05.968
It's not done.

18:06.033 --> 18:07.868
 Of course it's done I've done
  it.

18:07.934 --> 18:10.100
I don't want to argue about this
   with you.

18:10.167 --> 18:12.501
I'm asking you nicely.

18:12.567 --> 18:15.334
And I appreciate that. But this
  isn't one of your cousin's
   weddings.

18:15.400 --> 18:16.934
 You don't tip the bartender.

18:17.000 --> 18:21.567
  Okay. You gonna give me the
singles or not?

18:21.634 --> 18:25.067
Absolutely not. Look I
understand that you think you're
 being a good person,

18:25.133 --> 18:27.901
 and you are, but it's
 embarrassing and I don't want
 you doing it.

18:27.968 --> 18:29.834
  Are you like my keeper now?

18:29.901 --> 18:34.200
Listen.  I'm not going to open
my purse and support something I
   don't believe in.

18:34.267 --> 18:37.701
Do you understand that?  Now if
you want to go get singles and
  give them to the bartender

18:37.767 --> 18:42.300
 and embarrass yourself, fine.
 But I'm not going to help you
   make an ass of yourself.

18:42.367 --> 18:46.667
 Fine!  I forgot, what kind of
beer you want?

18:46.734 --> 18:51.400
   Uh, Stella would be fine.

18:51.467 --> 18:54.767
   Oh yeah.

18:54.834 --> 18:59.267
 I mean, unbelievable.

18:59.334 --> 19:03.367
Is it me?  Is it me?  Just tell
me if I'm wrong, tell me if I'm
wrong.

19:03.434 --> 19:09.467
 Yeah. No. They're, uh, I mean
  I've seen like a few people
   doing it but, no.

19:09.534 --> 19:15.100
Right.  He expects me to just -
Jesus - he's over there asking -

19:15.167 --> 19:20.901
What was that?

19:20.968 --> 19:23.868
 I don't know.
 It's awesome though.

19:23.934 --> 19:28.601
Don't say that we're like that.

19:28.667 --> 19:32.133
We're not.  We are not like that
at all.

20:05.267 --> 20:07.167
What are you doing in my closet?

20:07.234 --> 20:09.434
   Nothing.

20:09.501 --> 20:17.901
 Oh.  Here we go.  You should
wear this one.

20:17.968 --> 20:22.400
   Good one.

20:22.467 --> 20:23.834
 What?

20:23.901 --> 20:25.501
Shut up Vandy.

20:25.567 --> 20:29.667
You shut up.  I'm serious, you
 should wear this one.

20:29.734 --> 20:32.133
It would look really nice with
the gray suit.

20:32.200 --> 20:36.367
  Are you fucking kidding me?

20:36.434 --> 20:38.267
No I think you should wear it.

20:38.334 --> 20:42.400
Okay.  I'm serious, go back to
 bed.

20:42.467 --> 20:50.000
   What's the matter.  Poopy
 doesn't want to wear a purple
shirt?

20:50.067 --> 20:56.667
Poopy afraid he won't be a real
 man if he's wearing a purple.

20:56.734 --> 20:59.567
Poopy doesn't want to be touched
 okay?

20:59.634 --> 21:02.534
 Don't get all tense already.

21:02.601 --> 21:05.234
I'm not tense.

21:05.300 --> 21:08.234
   Stop acting like such an
   asshole.

21:08.300 --> 21:15.400
Why don't you go back to bed? 
It's early you don't need to be
up yet.

21:23.467 --> 21:26.734
   So you feel good?

21:26.801 --> 21:28.901
 What?

21:28.968 --> 21:31.968
I mean do you feel like
   yourself?

21:32.033 --> 21:34.167
  What are you talking about?

21:34.234 --> 21:37.567
Well you said before you don't
do well in interviews,

21:37.634 --> 21:42.133
 that you go into a trance or
something, and you never end up
 acting like yourself.

21:42.200 --> 21:48.634
So are you feeling like
   yourself?

21:48.701 --> 21:51.634
Yeah.  I'm feeling like myself.

21:51.701 --> 21:56.934
 Good.  You're gonna be fine.

21:57.000 --> 22:02.868
This tie is shorter than normal
 ones.

22:02.934 --> 22:04.133
   Want me to do it?

22:04.200 --> 22:08.968
So. Do you have things you know
you want to talk about?

22:09.033 --> 22:12.734
Or are you just going there and
 wing it? Or.

22:12.801 --> 22:17.634
No I just answer the questions.

22:17.701 --> 22:20.634
  Oh.

22:20.701 --> 22:22.534
 Why?

22:22.601 --> 22:32.434
Just wondering.

22:32.501 --> 22:34.234
 Are you okay?

22:34.300 --> 22:37.434
  Just can't believe this is
   happening again.

22:37.501 --> 22:40.067
  What's the matter?

22:40.133 --> 22:41.567
   Nothing.

22:41.634 --> 22:42.868
 What?

22:42.934 --> 22:49.334
I.  I hate interviews.  I suck
   at them.

22:49.400 --> 22:51.701
 I go in there and I apologize
  for myself

22:51.767 --> 22:56.467
and I just didn't think it was
  going to happen this time.

22:56.534 --> 22:58.834
 I thought I was done being a
jerkoff. Fuck!

22:58.901 --> 23:14.968
Hey now, come here. Oh my baby. 
Angel.  You're gonna be great.

23:17.033 --> 23:25.601
  I'm just so tense.

23:25.667 --> 23:32.200
 Would you like for me to help
  you relax?

23:32.267 --> 23:34.968
   What do you mean?

23:35.033 --> 23:51.167
 Just sit back.  Let me do the
  work.  Hey. Who's the best
   interviewer in the world?

23:52.067 --> 23:55.033
 I am.

23:55.100 --> 23:58.601
 That's right.

24:20.467 --> 24:23.367
  Thank you for saying that.

24:23.434 --> 24:25.701
  You mean the toast?

24:25.767 --> 24:28.367
  Yeah. No, I meant the wine.

24:28.434 --> 24:32.834
Oh. Yeah I figured you meant the
toast but maybe you spent a lot
   of time picking the wine.

24:32.901 --> 24:37.067
No I got the wine from my dad I
 - I meant the toast.

24:37.133 --> 24:40.934
  Thank you.

24:41.000 --> 24:45.801
You're welcome?  I'm sorry If I

24:45.868 --> 24:56.400
Don't. Can I ask you something?

24:56.467 --> 24:58.200
Course

24:58.267 --> 25:01.767
Because we said we were going to
  be honest with each other.

25:01.834 --> 25:04.901
Right.

25:04.968 --> 25:07.400
 What are you thinking about?

25:07.467 --> 25:11.067
  Right now?

25:11.133 --> 25:14.934
  Or just a few seconds ago.

25:15.000 --> 25:22.100
  Um, I'm not sure what I was
  thinking a few seconds ago.

25:22.167 --> 25:39.033
 Um, as for now, honestly, I'm
  angry that you would ask me
 that.

25:39.100 --> 25:45.934
   I feel like shit.
 What else would I be feeling?

25:46.000 --> 25:47.968
  I'm sorry.

25:48.033 --> 25:49.200
  It's okay.

25:49.267 --> 25:50.934
I was just trying to be close.

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
  It's fine.

25:55.067 --> 25:57.434
   I don't know why I asked.

25:57.501 --> 26:00.567
 It's okay, it's okay.

26:00.634 --> 26:09.133
 I like the way you do things.
  A lot. So.

26:17.334 --> 26:19.300
  I love you.

26:19.367 --> 26:20.701
You do?

26:20.767 --> 26:22.734
 I do.

26:22.801 --> 26:27.100
  Well good.

27:03.000 --> 27:06.334
  Oh my god.

27:06.400 --> 27:08.100
 Hello Vandy.

27:08.167 --> 27:09.601
  Hi.

27:09.667 --> 27:14.100
  So.

27:14.167 --> 27:15.300
What'cha doing?

27:15.367 --> 27:16.968
 I was just about to ask you.

27:17.033 --> 27:18.367
  Christmas shopping.

27:18.434 --> 27:21.033
Right I saw the bags, I should
  have put the two together.

27:21.100 --> 27:26.200
 I'm actually heading over to
   that golf store.

27:26.267 --> 27:31.601
I'm gong on a trip with uh Gary
 and Paul.  Going to Arizona.

27:31.667 --> 27:34.701
 Sure they're glad to have you
around.

27:34.767 --> 27:41.133
 Actually to do remember that
thing I read you about how you
   play golf during the day,

27:41.200 --> 27:47.501
uh, and you bet on all the holes
 an that night you play poker
  with the winnings?

27:47.567 --> 27:49.434
   Vaguely.

27:49.501 --> 27:59.334
 Yeah well, play poker uh with
the winnings until someone goes
 bust.  Should be fun.

27:59.400 --> 28:01.267
  It sounds like fun.

28:01.334 --> 28:06.601
Um, I should get going I have a
thousand things to do.

28:06.667 --> 28:09.000
  Emma and I are gong to the
  Caribbean after Christmas.

28:09.067 --> 28:10.868
 That's great! Where?

28:10.934 --> 28:14.467
St. Thomas.  It's her idea and 
   she got me the ticket and
  everything

28:14.534 --> 28:17.434
   and so I want to get her
something so I was going to go
to that place,

28:17.501 --> 28:22.000
that jewelry store that's near
 our apartment - my apartment,
and um

28:22.067 --> 28:25.601
 Yeah that's a nice place uh,
it's expensive.

28:25.667 --> 28:29.267
Yeah but I can have that jeweler
we know remake if I see
  something.

28:29.334 --> 28:31.133
Yeah that's what I was going to.

28:31.200 --> 28:34.300
So I was going to go do that and
then I was going to go tanning.

28:34.367 --> 28:36.934
  That's a good idea.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.634
 So I don't get burned in the
  Caribbean.

28:38.701 --> 28:42.667
  I know. Have you gone yet?

28:42.734 --> 28:44.133

color.

Thanks.

28:53.300 --> 28:57.601

28:57.667 --> 28:59.234
Yeah um

28:59.300 --> 29:02.601
I'm going in the other
direction, I would have walked
   with you.

29:02.667 --> 29:03.601
  It's okay.

29:03.667 --> 29:10.267
So is your family okay?

  time with the boys.

 Yeah you too.

29:40.968 --> 29:57.100
  **

30:21.000 --> 30:21.634
 Hey.

30:21.701 --> 30:23.300
 Hey.

30:23.367 --> 30:25.300
  So.

30:25.367 --> 30:27.133
  So.

30:27.200 --> 30:28.901
 How'd it go?

30:28.968 --> 30:30.834
 Fine.

30:30.901 --> 30:37.834
   That's it? How did it go?

30:37.901 --> 30:40.701
 It went fine.

30:40.767 --> 30:42.968
 Did they give you any
  indication?

30:43.033 --> 30:48.767
They thanked me and said they'd
 be in touch.  It went well, I
 mean.

30:48.834 --> 30:50.868
 Good you got the feeling then
  that it went well.

30:50.934 --> 30:52.734
Yeah I just said it went well.

30:52.801 --> 30:57.968
Yeah I know it's just you're not
   giving me any specifics.

30:58.033 --> 31:04.901
Well I don't know what to tell
 you it was an interview.  It
 went well, I guess, you know.

31:04.968 --> 31:09.267
They guy was like 60 years old
 so it's not like we, you know

31:09.334 --> 31:13.734
it's not like we had friends in
 common or something it was an
  interview.

31:13.801 --> 31:15.767
 Do you know if he liked you?

31:15.834 --> 31:17.801
 I don't know if he liked me.

31:17.868 --> 31:21.634
It's not like he was looking for
a new best friend he was looking
  for someone to do the job.

31:21.701 --> 31:25.701
 Someone who's competent, so,
that's what I was trying to be.

31:25.767 --> 31:27.367
 Trying to be?

31:27.434 --> 31:30.033
 Honestly I don't want to talk
   about it anymore.

31:30.100 --> 31:32.801
There's really nothing else to
  say.  It went fine.  Okay?

31:32.868 --> 31:35.868
 Okay

31:35.934 --> 31:39.734
You hungry?  You want me to fix
 you a snack?

31:39.801 --> 31:41.767
   Sure.  I don't see much.

31:41.834 --> 31:48.334
There isn't.  I could make you a
PB and J.  You want me to make
   you one?

31:48.400 --> 31:50.734
  I guess so.

31:50.801 --> 31:54.100
 Okay.

31:59.367 --> 32:02.000
Is that what you call a peanut
  butter and jelly sandwich?

32:02.067 --> 32:04.534
  A PB and J?

32:04.601 --> 32:10.234
  Yup.  Why?

32:10.300 --> 32:12.267
  Did the mail come?

32:12.334 --> 32:16.734
 Mmhmm yeah it was just junk. 
   And a travel and leisure
   magazine.

32:16.801 --> 32:18.133
Great.

32:18.200 --> 32:20.534
   Did they mention what the
  vacation time was?

32:20.601 --> 32:22.934
  No.

32:31.434 --> 32:34.133
  What are you doing?

32:34.200 --> 32:37.400
 Don't start with me.

32:37.467 --> 32:42.334
 I'm just trying to figure out
  what you're doing.

32:42.400 --> 32:45.367
I'm trying to be nice.

32:45.434 --> 32:50.334
Are you using two knives to make
   a peanut putter and jelly
   sandwich?

32:50.400 --> 32:58.400
Yeah uh, I don't want to get the
peanut butter in the jelly jar.
 Okay?

32:58.467 --> 32:59.534
Well -

32:59.601 --> 33:02.067
 Don't start with me.

33:02.133 --> 33:06.133
 Okay.

33:06.200 --> 33:07.934
  What is the matter.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.200
I mean you're going to get the
sandwich and it's going to taste
   the same.

33:10.267 --> 33:11.767
   What's the problem Peter?

33:11.834 --> 33:16.000
  There is no problem Vandy.

33:16.067 --> 33:18.934
  Like it's my fault.

33:19.000 --> 33:24.200
 You know what the problem is.

33:24.267 --> 33:32.901
  The problem is that only a
  fucking moron would use two
  knives to make a PB and J?

33:32.968 --> 33:36.634
Who do you think - give me the
knife.

33:36.701 --> 33:38.434
Peter -

33:38.501 --> 33:41.267
I'm not going to kill you Vandy 
just give me the knife.

33:41.334 --> 33:46.467
 Fine I'll use your other one.
  Now watch.

33:46.534 --> 33:51.300
First what you do is you spread
 the PB, okay.

33:51.367 --> 33:57.167
 Now you see this excess PB on
the knife?  You wipe it on the
 other slice of bread.  Okay?

33:57.234 --> 33:58.701
  See that peanut butter shit
stain?

33:58.767 --> 34:02.734
  That means the knife is now
clean and ready for the J, okay?

34:02.801 --> 34:08.766
Fuckface! Maybe if you shut up
and stopped being such a fucking
  psychopath

34:08.833 --> 34:10.467
  you might learn something.

34:10.534 --> 34:13.701
  You are a fucking asshole!

34:13.766 --> 34:16.367
Oh yeah it's always me being the
   asshole isn't it?

34:16.434 --> 34:20.501
   Why don't you try taking
  responsibility for your own
 stupid shit.

34:20.567 --> 34:25.734
I don't like doing it that way!
The knife is never clean enough!

34:25.801 --> 34:30.033
Okay, Fuckface! Why don't you go
fuck yourself.

34:36.701 --> 34:39.833
This bread is soft.  So it will 
 always make the knife clean!

34:39.900 --> 34:45.199
 Unless, you're a fucking ape,
   and don't know how to do
   anything.

34:45.266 --> 34:54.567
Don't take it out on me because
you choked in your interview. 

34:54.634 --> 34:56.333
  Hey who said I choked in my
  interview?

34:56.400 --> 35:01.167
Please

35:01.234 --> 35:09.901
Hey fuck you Vandy!  My
interview was fine, I nailed it
 okay?

35:09.968 --> 35:13.767
I'm the best interviewer in the
   world, remember?

35:41.901 --> 35:43.167
 Good morning.

35:43.234 --> 35:44.467
 Good morning.

35:44.534 --> 35:45.501
   Did I sleep late?
   What time is it?

35:45.567 --> 35:47.667
No.  I mean it's okay,
I just got up.

35:47.734 --> 35:56.234
Oh good. Good.
  Oh, you made eggs.

35:56.300 --> 35:59.868
  Yeah. I mean you were still
  asleep so.

35:59.934 --> 36:06.000
No no it's fine, I was just - I 
mean I'm glad you made eggs for
 yourself.  I'm fine.

36:17.801 --> 36:21.234
  I'm going to go put on some
clothes.  Do you mind if I don't
shower.

36:21.300 --> 36:23.567
   No of course not.

36:32.801 --> 36:39.968
 Uh, Vandy? Do you know where
 that box is with the sweaters
and the pants that uh,

36:40.033 --> 36:42.200
  it was in the bottom of the
 closet I never picked it up.

36:42.267 --> 36:48.634
Yeah, uh that box isn't around
   anymore.

36:48.701 --> 36:50.300
   It's not?

36:50.367 --> 36:52.634
  No.

36:52.701 --> 36:55.367
Is it somewhere else? Existing?

36:55.434 --> 36:57.834
  No.

36:57.901 --> 37:03.934
 Oh.  Okay that, no that's uh,
 that's fine.

37:04.000 --> 37:10.534
Um, actually do you still have
that sweatshirt that I gave you?

37:10.601 --> 37:14.934
 Yeah I still have it, it's in
the top dresser drawer.

37:15.000 --> 37:19.834
 Right. Okay.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.234
 That embarrasses you?
   Me giving him $3?

37:24.300 --> 37:25.667
 Yes because you are a
 representation of me.

37:25.734 --> 37:28.534
I can't believe she said that to
 him.

37:28.601 --> 37:29.834
I know.

37:29.901 --> 37:31.667
I would kill you if you talked
   to me like that.

37:31.734 --> 37:32.801
  Oh shut up.

37:32.868 --> 37:33.868
 You shut up.

37:33.934 --> 37:35.467
You talk to me like that all the
 time.

37:35.534 --> 37:37.767
 Hey I do not! Don't say that.

37:37.834 --> 37:42.501
  What happened with them is
fucked up.  I didn't like that.

37:42.567 --> 37:48.868
 No you're right.  Keith is a
  pretty good dancer.

37:48.934 --> 37:54.033
Look at Delia.

38:01.834 --> 38:04.667
  Alright who made the gravy?

38:04.734 --> 38:07.000
I did. I made the stuffing too,
it's terrific.

38:07.067 --> 38:09.067
 Hey Deal's sweetie, you want
  some gravy?

38:09.133 --> 38:10.801
 No.  It's disgusting.

38:10.868 --> 38:12.834
  You don't like gravy? It's
  delicious.

38:12.901 --> 38:15.400
 I don't eat gravy and I don't
  eat Turkey.

38:15.467 --> 38:17.300
   Okay, do you want to eat
   stuffing?

38:17.367 --> 38:18.434
I eat stuffing.

38:18.501 --> 38:20.834
Okay. Give her a little
   stuffing.

38:20.901 --> 38:23.934
V you don't know how excited I
   am fir this TRIP.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.067
I think I need it as much as you
  do.

38:26.133 --> 38:28.000
  Yeah I'll be great.

38:28.067 --> 38:30.334
Careful with the spelling she's
 getting GOOD.

38:30.400 --> 38:35.834
You know what I would actually 
  like to make a toast to the
 Patron Saint Thomas,

38:35.901 --> 38:39.167
thank you for what we are about
  to receive.

38:39.234 --> 38:40.801
That's very clever I like that.

38:40.868 --> 38:44.667
Have you seen Highheeled Shoes
  yet hunny?

38:44.734 --> 38:46.133
No mom.

38:46.200 --> 38:48.467
You should it can be so
  uplifting.

38:48.534 --> 38:50.934
  Does anybody want some more
  white meat?

38:51.000 --> 38:54.133
Oh you know I got you an extra
  um turkey thigh too hunny.

38:54.200 --> 38:55.467
  Thank you.

38:55.534 --> 38:56.767
  You have to keep eating you
 know.

38:56.834 --> 38:58.067
 Yeah, I know.

38:58.133 --> 39:00.133
We have eggplant parm coming so.

39:00.200 --> 39:03.400
 You know if there's anything
special you liked you just as me
 okay?

39:03.467 --> 39:05.267
 Mom, give me a break.

39:05.334 --> 39:08.901
I think she knows how to eat so.

39:08.968 --> 39:11.934
 But I mean it, just anything.
It's what I'm here for.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.767
 Just stop it.

39:14.834 --> 39:20.534
 You know Van your mother says
these things because she cares
  about you.

39:20.601 --> 39:29.434
Nice job spitting it into your
  napkin hun.

39:29.501 --> 39:32.167
 I don't like stuffing either.

39:32.234 --> 39:34.968
 What! You loved the stuffing
 last year.  You remember how
 much you ate?

39:35.033 --> 39:36.701
Emma -

39:36.767 --> 39:39.200
Huh? No, do you remember?  You
said "I want to eat stuffing all
  the time".

39:39.267 --> 39:40.167
 Emma

39:40.234 --> 39:42.167
 What?

39:42.234 --> 39:43.501
 PETER made the stuffing last
 year.

39:43.567 --> 39:46.701
   Did you just spell Peter?

39:46.767 --> 39:48.734
 Yes I did, that is very good.

39:48.801 --> 39:51.667
You know there's a Peter in her
  class that's how she knows.

39:51.734 --> 39:53.567
  That's not how I know I can
 read!

39:53.634 --> 39:55.367
No I know, hun.

39:55.434 --> 39:57.868
Is Peter coming today?

39:57.934 --> 39:59.834
 Who hunny, the Peter in your
class?

39:59.901 --> 40:02.267
 No, Vandy's husband.

40:02.334 --> 40:05.834
 You know what hunny they were
never actually married.

40:05.901 --> 40:07.801
   Emma, what are you doing?

40:07.868 --> 40:08.734
 What!

40:08.801 --> 40:10.634
  No hunny he's not.

40:10.701 --> 40:11.968
 Why?

40:12.033 --> 40:15.367
Because he doesn't realize what
   a commitment is.

40:15.434 --> 40:16.934
 Mom.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.367
You know what, he just couldn't
   make it.

40:19.434 --> 40:22.734
Will Pete make the stuffing next
 year?

40:22.801 --> 40:26.767
  You know the more you make
 things up the more question's
   you're gonna get.

40:26.834 --> 40:31.367
  Peter and I aren't friends
   anymore.

40:31.434 --> 40:33.167
 Why?

40:33.234 --> 40:39.167
 You know what, hunny.  Peter
wanted to be friends with other
people

40:39.234 --> 40:41.400
while he was friends with Vandy
and you're not really allowed -

40:41.467 --> 40:43.234
  Emma - what are you doing?

40:43.300 --> 40:44.234
Well -

40:44.300 --> 40:45.734
  You can have more than one
friend

40:45.801 --> 40:47.234
 That's exactly right sweetie.

40:47.300 --> 40:49.400
  Yeah but Peter wanted to be
 friends with this one person,

40:49.467 --> 40:50.834
and he wasn't really allowed to
 be friends -

40:50.901 --> 40:52.767
Okay that is not why everything
   happened.

40:52.834 --> 40:54.734
 Peter just wasn't a very nice
person.

40:54.801 --> 41:00.267
Mom! Honestly!  Sorry.

41:00.334 --> 41:11.133
   Peter was a nice person,
   didn't you think?

41:11.200 --> 41:13.033
 Yes.

41:13.100 --> 41:16.367
Yeah, he was nice.  I don't know
why we're not friends anymore.

41:16.434 --> 41:18.133
 He was funny.

41:18.200 --> 41:22.634
Yeah he is funny.  He's a good
person and he didn't do anything
wrong.

41:22.701 --> 41:23.968
 Jesus Christ.

41:24.033 --> 41:27.100
 Mom.

41:35.067 --> 41:38.434
  No one did anything wrong.

41:42.400 --> 41:43.400
 Hey.

41:43.467 --> 41:44.968
 You alright?

41:45.033 --> 41:46.167
 Yeah.

41:46.234 --> 41:52.601
Nervous? Everyone seems to love
 your painter.

41:52.667 --> 41:56.334
Yeah I know I sold two more of
her paintings.

41:56.400 --> 42:01.534
 Wow, that's amazing.
 Hey should I buy one?

42:01.601 --> 42:03.467
   Do you like them?

42:03.534 --> 42:06.601
Uh yeah, yeah.

42:06.667 --> 42:11.100
  You don't have to buy one.

42:11.167 --> 42:12.634
   You sure?

42:12.701 --> 42:13.968
 Yeah.

42:14.033 --> 42:16.968
Are you happy?

42:17.033 --> 42:18.400
  Of course.

42:18.467 --> 42:21.934
  Well you should be.

42:29.567 --> 42:34.801
Do you want to meet my parents? 
They're going to be in town next
   weekend.

42:34.868 --> 42:38.434
Yeah, I should.

42:38.501 --> 42:39.901
I don't want to twist your arm.

42:39.968 --> 42:42.234
  No, fine, it's fine. Yeah.

42:42.300 --> 42:43.901
We'll go for a dinner.

42:43.968 --> 42:47.567
 'Kay.  I'll find us a place.
   Where do you want to go?

42:47.634 --> 42:49.434
 No, no, no, my secretary will
  take care of that.

42:49.501 --> 42:53.067
She gets hooked up everywhere so
we are all set.

42:53.133 --> 42:55.767
Ooh I am gonna grab a couple of
these.

42:55.834 --> 43:06.601
This is a great night for you.
   Congrats.

43:06.667 --> 43:15.000
I think I am going to buy one of
  these pictures. Portraits.

43:15.067 --> 43:20.200
I don't want you to buy one of
   these paintings.

43:20.267 --> 43:23.000
  No I would like to.

43:23.067 --> 43:28.367
Okay if you - whatever - if you
see a painting and you like it,
great.

43:28.434 --> 43:31.868
  Is that a problem?

43:31.934 --> 43:35.267
I don't want you to buy one to
   be nice.

43:35.334 --> 43:37.367
   Why not?

43:37.434 --> 43:39.901
   'Cause that's insulting.

43:43.567 --> 43:45.234
 What?

43:45.300 --> 43:49.934
Nothing.  You know what, you've
got a lot of people you need to
talk to tonight

43:50.000 --> 43:53.033
so I think that I am gonna go.

43:53.100 --> 43:57.467
   No Andrew I want to know.
If you're angry you can tell me.

43:57.534 --> 44:00.501
I know, I know.

44:00.567 --> 44:06.501
No, you know it was my bad.  It
was my bad so, uh, this is your
night,

44:06.567 --> 44:12.133
you know actually no, it is my
 bad, that was my bad.

44:12.200 --> 44:21.834
   I'll stop by your office
   tomorrow afternoon, okay?
We can get lunch or something.

44:21.901 --> 44:23.634
   I can't I start jury duty
   tomorrow.

44:23.701 --> 44:27.133
 That's right.

44:27.200 --> 44:27.934
Sorry.

44:28.000 --> 44:44.067
  **

44:55.200 --> 44:56.968
 Hey.

44:57.033 --> 44:58.934
Hey. Uh, Peter.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.200
  Yeah.  Hello Vandy.

45:01.267 --> 45:02.767
How's it going?

45:02.834 --> 45:04.400
   Umm, not so bad.

45:04.467 --> 45:10.400
Good to hear.  Alright well, it
  was good seeing ya.

45:10.467 --> 45:12.267
You still on that case?

45:12.334 --> 45:13.934
 Almost done.

45:14.000 --> 45:19.601
Awesome. Listen Vandy, this is
going to sound a little out of
nowhere but uh,

45:19.667 --> 45:23.133
Before you say anything I should
 tell you I'm dating someone.

45:23.200 --> 45:26.767
Okay.  I wasn't going to ask you
out on a date.

45:26.834 --> 45:28.868
  Oh.

45:28.934 --> 45:33.334
  But you're not that far off
base. I told you this was out of
  nowhere, we only met once,

45:33.400 --> 45:36.133
 but I have something for you.

45:36.200 --> 45:38.400
  Oh?

45:38.467 --> 45:44.167
It's not like it's a body part
 or something, okay, I'm not a
 stalker or a.

45:44.234 --> 45:54.267
And I realize that you're dating
someone, that's fine, but you'll
   see it's really nothing.

45:54.334 --> 46:01.801
Here it is.  It's the crossword
   puzzle from two days ago.

46:01.868 --> 46:06.701
 I was doing it and there was
this clue "Southern university
  for short,"

46:06.767 --> 46:12.167
and the answer was Vandy.  Short
for Vanderbilt.

46:12.234 --> 46:17.067
I actually finished that puzzle
 and Vandy was one of the last
   ones I filled out

46:17.133 --> 46:27.367
and I was like, 'Hey!' And truth
 be told you'd run through my
  mind more than a few times

46:27.434 --> 46:32.934
since that day I met you and uh,
and then the puzzle so I took a
chance.

46:33.000 --> 46:38.834
I thought you said you finished
  it.

46:38.901 --> 46:42.701
Yeah.  I, well I picked up a new
   one at the deli.

46:42.767 --> 46:48.801
That way you can just fill out
 Vandy, or the whole thing, or
leave it blank,

46:48.868 --> 46:51.968
or crumple it up and put it in
the garbage like you're probably
   going to.

46:52.033 --> 46:56.567
 It was just a random thing. I
 thought of you when I saw it

46:56.634 --> 47:03.067
 and I understand that you're.
  I'm sorry.

47:03.133 --> 47:14.300
No there's no need to apologize.
  This is. Thank you.

47:14.367 --> 47:24.267
   Well uh, I, I should go.

47:24.334 --> 47:28.334
   No, yeah, yeah of course.

47:28.400 --> 47:32.567
Giving up that easily?

47:32.634 --> 47:40.133
   Do you like Indian food?

47:40.200 --> 47:41.701
 Yeah.

47:41.767 --> 47:45.467
 Okay do you know that street
with all the Indian restaurants
on it?

47:45.534 --> 47:47.701
  Curry Row?

47:47.767 --> 47:52.701
Yes. Curry Row.  Would you like
 to go to one of those places
   with me?

47:52.767 --> 47:56.300
  Which one?

48:09.467 --> 48:14.434
  Hi.

48:14.501 --> 48:16.834
  Hi.

48:16.901 --> 48:18.601
 Did you design this?

48:18.667 --> 48:23.367
Uh yeah, it was actually my idea
to make the whole thing entirely
 out of glass.

48:23.434 --> 48:25.267
   Oh cool.

48:25.334 --> 48:32.300
No I'm kidding I just make the
models.  No I hate those glass
pieces of shit.

48:32.367 --> 48:33.567
Really?

48:33.634 --> 48:36.100
Yeah.  But that's all they make
so, they're everywhere.

48:36.167 --> 48:38.734
Yeah, no I can't stand the sight
   of them.

48:38.801 --> 48:45.033
 I'm Michelle.

48:45.100 --> 48:46.834
 Hi Michelle.

48:46.901 --> 48:51.434
  So you really enjoy working
 here.

48:51.501 --> 48:58.267
I do actually.  I'm kidding.  No
 I'm actually interviewing but
  don't say anything.

48:58.334 --> 49:01.734
  Oh I won't.  I just started
 here.

49:01.801 --> 49:03.167
   Oh yeah?

49:03.234 --> 49:07.400
Do you know of any good places
  to eat around here?

49:07.467 --> 49:09.801
I was looking for like a really
good BBQ place.

49:09.868 --> 49:14.634
Oh well I don't know of a lot of
 really good BBQ places around
 here,

49:14.701 --> 49:17.767
 but there's a great barbeque
 place that's not so far away.

49:17.834 --> 49:21.868
   Are you making fun of me?
  You're lucky you're funny.

49:21.934 --> 49:26.300
 Thank you I uh, I like making
  people LOL.

49:26.367 --> 49:28.767
 Oh my god, whatever.

49:28.834 --> 49:36.267
 Let me, let me help you with
those.

49:36.334 --> 49:37.934
  I seriously think I got it.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.300
No no I can take them. I'll just
take them to the files.

49:40.367 --> 49:42.067
  I've got it really.

49:42.133 --> 49:43.734
Just give me some of the files.

49:43.801 --> 49:48.100
Alright, four whiskies.

49:48.167 --> 49:55.167
 I can't, I gotta go.

49:55.234 --> 49:57.033
   Come on!

49:57.100 --> 50:03.267
It's mine an Marissa's
 anniversary tomorrow.

50:03.334 --> 50:05.434
 To Paul and.

50:05.501 --> 50:08.334
 Marissa, her name is Marissa.

50:08.400 --> 50:10.033
I'm joking, I'm joking.

50:10.100 --> 50:11.767
I'm telling her.  All that shit
  you said, I'm telling her.

50:11.834 --> 50:15.434
   Woah, woah, woah, you and
   Marissa are okay, right?

50:15.501 --> 50:17.801
   Yeah man.

50:17.868 --> 50:20.767
Well what we were talking about
  last week.

50:20.834 --> 50:22.901
 I mea, don't worry about it.

50:22.968 --> 50:25.734
Well I just didn't want to toast
 if you guys.

50:25.801 --> 50:27.133
  We're fine man, don't worry
   about it.

50:27.200 --> 50:31.434
 Cool, cool.  Cheers.

50:41.033 --> 50:42.801
   Forget about it.

50:42.868 --> 50:47.133
Okay. You guys are not splitting
up.  You guys are going to stay
   together.

50:47.200 --> 50:51.801
Yes. And could you pretend that
 I didn't say anything to you.

50:51.868 --> 50:53.067
   Yeah. Yes I can.

50:53.133 --> 50:54.467
   'Cause you know she can.

50:54.534 --> 51:01.067
I do.  Good, oh good.  I am so
happy.  That is fucking awesome.

51:01.133 --> 51:02.834
  Okay, okay.

51:02.901 --> 51:05.534
 No I'm serious.  When you're
with someone it always comes to
  that point

51:05.601 --> 51:08.300
   where you just gotta work
  through that stuff.

51:08.367 --> 51:11.467
 I got it man, I got it, I got
  it.  How you doing?

51:11.534 --> 51:16.934
I'm a little fucked up.
  I'm sorry I'm acting like a
  douche bag.

51:21.100 --> 51:27.434
 Keith? Keith. Keith!

51:27.501 --> 51:31.100
Is that Keith?

51:31.167 --> 51:33.033
  Keith? How are you?

51:33.100 --> 51:34.734
 I'm sorry, I'm not -

51:34.801 --> 51:36.901
How is everyone?  How's Delia?

51:36.968 --> 51:38.534
I don't know what you're talking
about.

51:38.601 --> 51:39.934
   Have you talked to Vandy?

51:40.000 --> 51:41.901
 No I haven't talked to Vandy.

51:41.968 --> 51:45.734
Will you just tell Emma to tell
 her, I was trying to tell her
  but she just won't.

51:45.801 --> 51:48.868
  It wasn't about this other
   person, okay?  It was all

51:48.934 --> 51:50.968
HeY listen man, I'm not

51:51.033 --> 51:54.100
No no, it was about us and our
shit, and that's even what she
 was saying -

51:54.167 --> 51:55.367
  Did she? Oh really?

51:55.434 --> 51:56.868
And I didn't even fucking sleep
with the other person -

51:56.934 --> 51:59.567
  You didn't?
No! No.
  You didn't sleep with her?

51:59.634 --> 52:02.100
 No I did not!
 And she - You slept with her?
 No I did not

52:02.167 --> 52:04.167
 Yes you did.
   I - Keith
   I can tell he did

52:04.234 --> 52:06.300
  Listen Keith you know me, I
 wouldn't sleep with anybody.

52:06.367 --> 52:07.501
  She wouldn't listen to me.

52:07.567 --> 52:09.434
  Dude listen to me.

52:09.501 --> 52:10.801
 What?

52:10.868 --> 52:15.701
I'm not Keith.  I'm not Keith. 
   I don't know you.

52:15.767 --> 52:18.033
   That ain't Keith.

52:18.100 --> 52:21.167
 Am I losing my mind?
That guy looks a lot like Keith.

52:21.234 --> 52:22.868
  He looks a lot like him but
   that's not Keith.

52:22.934 --> 52:26.968
 He looks like Keith.

52:27.033 --> 52:29.734
 He looks exactly like Keith! 
 I'm really sorry man.

52:29.801 --> 52:30.734
  It's cool.

52:30.801 --> 52:33.100
 I'm sorry that was fucked up
though.

52:33.167 --> 52:36.167
 Yeah that was a little fucked
up, umm I didn't know how that
was going to work out.

52:36.234 --> 52:38.701
 Yeah well I swear to God you
 look exactly like my
brother-in-law,

52:38.767 --> 52:40.467
or this guy who was going to be
  my brother-in-law.

52:40.534 --> 52:41.467
  He looks like him.

52:41.534 --> 52:44.767
   Wow. Okay. That is. Wow.

52:44.834 --> 52:48.868
That guys was fucking with me.

52:48.934 --> 52:51.767
 No he wasn't you were fucking
with him.  He told you he wasn't
Keith.

52:51.834 --> 52:53.033
   He pretended to be Keith.

52:53.100 --> 52:54.133
 He wasn't pretending.

52:54.200 --> 52:55.367
  He was pretending.

52:55.434 --> 52:57.133
Sit your ass down, what's wrong
   with you.

52:57.200 --> 52:59.567
  Hey hey hey hey hey

52:59.634 --> 53:01.534
You wish you were Keith. Keith's
  a pretty fucking cool guy.

53:01.601 --> 53:10.701
  I got an email from my mom
saying that Highheeled Shoes is
   a terrific movie

53:10.767 --> 53:13.234
  and that we should see it.

53:13.300 --> 53:17.234
That's the one with the southern
 bell with five southern bell
  daughters.

53:17.300 --> 53:19.167
  Interested?

53:19.234 --> 53:22.100
  I'd rather have my scrotum
  nailed to a chair.

53:22.167 --> 53:29.934
 Oh she also wanted to know if
you wanted to make that stuffing
for Thanksgiving again.

53:30.000 --> 53:32.834
  Does she need to know now?

53:32.901 --> 53:38.300
  Well do you want to make it
 or... uh she needs to

53:38.367 --> 53:43.534
  going to take my dad to the
 dermatologist and it's right
  next to the specialty store

53:43.601 --> 53:45.200
where was going to order some of

53:45.267 --> 53:46.968
 Can I just call her?

53:47.033 --> 53:49.000
 Yeah

53:55.200 --> 53:57.000
 Time for bed.

53:57.067 --> 53:59.067
I'm not ready for bed.

53:59.133 --> 54:02.133
  Come on we've got a big day
   tomorrow.

54:02.200 --> 54:08.534
I don't want you falling asleep
   out here again.  Come on.

54:08.601 --> 54:11.133
Why don't you stay here and talk
to me.

54:11.200 --> 54:15.234
  We can talk in bed.

54:15.300 --> 54:17.801
 I don't want to talk in bed.

54:28.167 --> 54:33.701
 So.  What's going on?

54:33.767 --> 54:42.000
  Um

54:42.067 --> 54:46.501
 I thought you wanted to talk.

54:53.300 --> 54:56.033
   I'm going to the bedroom.

54:56.100 --> 54:58.868
 I'm not happy Vandy.

54:58.934 --> 55:02.701
Yeah about like work and stuff?

55:02.767 --> 55:04.100
  Everything

55:04.167 --> 55:07.667
Oh, can I help?

55:07.734 --> 55:14.834
 I don't know.  I haven't been
too happy here either.

55:14.901 --> 55:25.667
 I don't know if I want to do
 this anymore.

55:25.734 --> 55:28.634
Nobody does this for no reason. 
   Was there somebody else?

55:28.701 --> 55:34.934
  No! That's not, you're not,
 that's - no - that's not what
this is about.

55:35.000 --> 55:40.601
Okay, sometimes I think it just
comes down to whether or not two
  people should be together.

55:40.667 --> 55:43.033
You don't think that we should
 be together?

55:43.100 --> 55:45.601
  I don't know. I don't know
Vandy.

55:45.667 --> 55:48.767
I mean the way we are now, no. 
I don't want to be with you like
 this.

55:54.601 --> 55:57.000
   Can you give me a reason?

55:57.067 --> 56:00.100
I thought about this recently.

56:00.167 --> 56:06.000
 I've been around a lot of new
 people through work and it's
   like I'm

56:06.067 --> 56:10.300
all these things are coming out
   of me all this stuff um,

56:10.367 --> 56:16.100
 it's me, it's everything that
  reminds me of who I am, me,

56:16.167 --> 56:28.501
and I haven't felt like that in
  a long time.  I'm not that
   person with you.

56:28.567 --> 56:36.000
I think I used to be like that
with you but you've been trying
to kill it ever since.

56:36.067 --> 56:38.667
It's like you're trying to kill
  me.

56:38.734 --> 56:41.033
  I'm not trying to kill you
Peter.

56:41.100 --> 56:43.234
Not literally it's just me, who
 I am.

56:43.300 --> 56:50.067
Ever since the day we met it's
like, I mean that's exactly what
 it feels like to me.

56:50.133 --> 56:58.734
And it's not just you I mean I'm
sure I do it too but I need to
  be able to feel me.

56:58.801 --> 57:05.100
 I feel like I've been asleep.

57:05.167 --> 57:12.701
A couple weeks ago remember that
you were acting really nice to
   me and genuinely

57:12.767 --> 57:17.934
   and I felt uncomfortable.

57:18.000 --> 57:23.801
Like I was outside of my comfort
  zone with you being loving
  towards me.

57:30.934 --> 57:33.968
   It made me feel horrible.

57:34.067 --> 57:39.367
  I didn't want it to be like
 this.

57:39.434 --> 57:41.234
I didn't want it to be like this
either.

58:04.767 --> 58:07.567
 Don't ever leave me.
 Don't ever leave me.

58:07.634 --> 58:09.133
  I'm not going to leave you.

58:25.033 --> 58:26.467
Peter.

58:26.534 --> 58:31.033
 Yeah?

58:31.100 --> 58:36.067
Is there someone else?

58:42.200 --> 58:46.100
Is there someone else?

58:46.167 --> 58:49.834
  It wasn't anything

58:49.901 --> 58:51.133
  Oh my god!

58:51.200 --> 58:51.901
 Vandy

58:51.968 --> 58:52.801
  Oh my god!

58:52.868 --> 58:54.033
No, no.  Listen it was nothing.

58:54.100 --> 58:55.701
 Don't you, don't you fucking
   touch me!

58:55.767 --> 58:57.000
   Vandy, calm down

58:57.067 --> 58:58.567
   Holy shit

58:58.634 --> 59:00.234
Listen to me.  The problems that
we have are between us.

59:00.300 --> 59:02.000
   Nothing happened!

59:02.067 --> 59:03.801
Shit I knew it.

59:03.868 --> 59:06.200
Don't do this okay we got so far
  last night because I didn't
 bring it up.

59:06.267 --> 59:08.033
   Let's just talk about it.

59:08.100 --> 59:09.300
Get the fuck out oh my god get
 out of here.

59:09.367 --> 59:10.534
 Like we talked about it last
night!

59:10.601 --> 59:11.701
No, no, no, no. Just get out of
here get the fuck out.

59:11.767 --> 59:12.501
 Please don't do this.

59:12.567 --> 59:14.501
 Back up! Get Get out!

59:14.567 --> 59:15.067
   Alright.

59:27.434 --> 59:30.968
Okay here's a question for you. 
The crossword puzzle. You said
   you finished it.

59:31.033 --> 59:32.267
I did.

59:32.334 --> 59:33.767
 What day of the week was it?

59:33.834 --> 59:35.701
  It was a Saturday.

59:35.767 --> 59:37.868
  Oh that's the toughest one,
right?

59:37.934 --> 59:42.634
   Yeah.  My mom always does
crossword puzzles so I've been
  doing them forever.

59:42.701 --> 59:44.968
I am impressed.

59:45.033 --> 59:49.200
  Yeah no, yeah it's a really
productive way of spending your
 time.

59:49.267 --> 59:52.300
Do you do crossword puzzles or.

59:52.367 --> 59:57.167
 No, that's good, so we don't
   have to fight over them.

59:57.234 --> 01:00:04.033
 So I hope you didn't have to
change your schedule around too
  much to uh.

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:05.200
   To what?

01:00:05.267 --> 01:00:07.300
  For dinner.

01:00:07.367 --> 01:00:08.834
 A little bit.

01:00:08.901 --> 01:00:13.934
Yeah.  I just meant uh, nothing
really.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.634
You mean did I tell the guy I'm
seeing?

01:00:16.701 --> 01:00:27.300
No, well no that's not what I. 
That's not what I was expecting
  you to say.

01:00:27.367 --> 01:00:33.234
I guess I was saying more like
did you have a date that you had
   to break off with him or.

01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:37.634
I really was trying not to talk
about this more than anything,

01:00:37.701 --> 01:00:39.400
and here I am just talking about
  it.

01:00:39.467 --> 01:00:41.033
 Okay.

01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:42.367
  I'm sorry.

01:00:42.434 --> 01:00:44.200
 No it's okay.

01:00:44.267 --> 01:00:49.334
Sorry but you said you changed
your plans a little bit, though

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:51.801
Do you want to be talking about
it or.

01:00:51.868 --> 01:00:56.133
I guess I do..?

01:00:56.200 --> 01:01:01.934
Um, well I was supposed to meet
up with him later but instead I
  broke up with him.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:10.901
 Oh, wow.  Are you regretting
   that yet?

01:01:10.968 --> 01:01:17.067
 Yeah.  No.  I wasn't thrilled
with the way things were going
   with him anyway.

01:01:17.133 --> 01:01:20.434
No, well, of course - I'm sorry
I wasn't implying that you did
   it because of me.

01:01:20.501 --> 01:01:24.200
  That's okay.  And it really
 wasn't that nasty a break up.

01:01:24.267 --> 01:01:26.400
  So if this date goes really
 badly

01:01:26.467 --> 01:01:28.634
I think I still have a shot of
getting back together with him.

01:01:28.701 --> 01:01:30.000
   Good one.

01:01:30.067 --> 01:01:31.400
Thanks.

01:01:31.467 --> 01:01:34.467
 Sorry I brought all this up. 
It's stupid I'm sorry.

01:01:34.534 --> 01:01:37.667
No why do you always..

01:01:37.734 --> 01:01:39.534
 What?

01:01:39.601 --> 01:01:43.701
 It's nothing.

01:01:43.767 --> 01:01:48.167
  No tell me please.

01:01:48.234 --> 01:01:51.033
   Well you apologize a lot.

01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:55.667
 Do I?

01:01:55.734 --> 01:01:57.767
  Little bit.

01:01:57.834 --> 01:02:05.701
Sorry about that.  I'm kidding.
   No I know what you mean.

01:02:05.767 --> 01:02:08.267
 I'm not saying it like it's a
   problem.

01:02:08.334 --> 01:02:13.000
  No it's fine trust me it's
 something that I'm aware of.

01:02:13.067 --> 01:02:16.567
I feel like a jerkoff when I do
  it.

01:02:16.634 --> 01:02:18.234
  No that's not what I meant.

01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:22.801
No. It's fine. I mean it.  You
know what I think it is
   actually?

01:02:22.868 --> 01:02:25.801
Tell me what you think because
I'm not, I'm not too sure myself
 but,

01:02:25.868 --> 01:02:30.767
 no I think I apologize a lot
   when I'm.

01:02:30.834 --> 01:02:34.367
   Not really sorry?

01:02:34.434 --> 01:02:37.033
That too. Yeah.

01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:41.367
 I no, I wasn't trying to turn
 this into a nitpick session.

01:02:41.434 --> 01:02:46.167
I don't know Jesus even on our
  first date.

01:02:46.234 --> 01:02:48.167
 No please are you kidding me?

01:02:48.234 --> 01:02:54.334
This is exactly what I'm this is
the kind of stuff I would always
want you to tell me if we were,

01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:59.701
 um, no I'm glad you said it. 
  Seriously.

01:02:59.767 --> 01:03:03.000
Like I said I like to knock it
off so.

01:03:03.067 --> 01:03:10.934
Not a problem, honestly, bring
it on!

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:17.667
I am really glad I'm here with
 you.

01:03:17.734 --> 01:03:22.133
   So am I.

01:03:24.033 --> 01:03:25.501
  No.

01:03:25.567 --> 01:03:26.167
Nuhuh.

01:03:26.234 --> 01:03:27.300
   I insist.

01:03:27.367 --> 01:03:28.501
 I have it.  Give me a break.

01:03:28.567 --> 01:03:29.801
 You got me a present.

01:03:29.868 --> 01:03:31.400
 The crossword puzzle?

01:03:31.467 --> 01:03:32.534
 Yeah.

01:03:32.601 --> 01:03:34.300
You do realize that the New York
 Times is $1?

01:03:34.367 --> 01:03:35.834
 Yeah but you had to get two.

01:03:35.901 --> 01:03:38.200
   Oh. You're right.
   It was a $2 gift.

01:03:38.267 --> 01:03:43.067
Would it make you feel better if
   you left the tip?

01:03:43.133 --> 01:03:45.000
 Fine.

01:03:45.067 --> 01:03:48.601
Okay.  You take care of the tip.

01:03:48.667 --> 01:03:51.934
   You're terrific.

01:04:09.067 --> 01:04:10.834
What do you think it was about?

01:04:10.901 --> 01:04:14.634
  Paul is a very good tipper.

01:04:14.701 --> 01:04:15.934
 No seriously.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.400
Vandy, they've always been like
  that from day one.

01:04:18.467 --> 01:04:21.501
 They can't stay together like
 that.

01:04:21.567 --> 01:04:24.901
 All Paul wanted to do was tip
   the guy.

01:04:24.968 --> 01:04:29.567
Yeah you're not really supposed
to tip at these things.  She's
right actually.

01:04:29.634 --> 01:04:31.567
   Are you serious?

01:04:31.634 --> 01:04:32.434
 Yeah.

01:04:32.501 --> 01:04:33.634
   You're an idiot.

01:04:33.701 --> 01:04:35.534
   You're an idiot.

01:04:35.601 --> 01:04:38.300
 What's it like being the less
   intelligent person in the
 relationship?

01:04:38.367 --> 01:04:41.667
   Good one.

01:04:41.734 --> 01:04:42.634
  Seriously.

01:04:42.701 --> 01:04:43.968
   Fuck off.

01:04:44.033 --> 01:04:45.868
Maybe you and Keith should form
   a support group.

01:04:45.934 --> 01:04:50.200
You know I am starving. Do you
mind if we just go home

01:04:50.267 --> 01:04:53.567
  and you can make me a nice
peanut butter and jelly
   sandwich.

01:04:53.634 --> 01:04:58.767
   No because I just ran the
 dishwasher so there should be
  enough silverware for you.

01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:09.033
Would you like to dance with me?

01:05:16.601 --> 01:05:18.734
Have they always been like that?

01:05:18.801 --> 01:05:21.367
   They fought at their own
   wedding.

01:05:21.434 --> 01:05:24.267
   Like we just saw?

01:05:24.334 --> 01:05:26.000
 Maybe worse.

01:05:26.067 --> 01:05:31.834
Jesus.  Why are they together? 
Does Paul talk to you about this
stuff?

01:05:31.901 --> 01:05:33.334
  No.

01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:35.667
  That is so annoying to me.

01:05:35.734 --> 01:05:43.868
 Can I tell you something you
promise you won't tell anyone?

01:05:43.934 --> 01:05:45.968
  I promise.

01:05:46.033 --> 01:05:47.501
Promise you won't tell.

01:05:47.567 --> 01:05:49.267
Oh my god just fucking tell me.

01:05:49.334 --> 01:05:56.100
 There was this one time where
Paul told me that he was gonna
  leave her.

01:05:56.167 --> 01:06:01.400
  Shut up.  What did you say?

01:06:01.467 --> 01:06:04.267
  I told him not too.

01:06:04.334 --> 01:06:06.567
Really?

01:06:06.634 --> 01:06:08.000
 Yeah.

01:06:08.067 --> 01:06:08.868
 Why?

01:06:08.934 --> 01:06:10.133
 I don't know.

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:14.300
I can't believe you never told
   me that.

01:06:14.367 --> 01:06:16.234
 Yeah.

01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:18.167
I mean jeeze what the hell do we
 have to talk about you don't
  tell me that story?

01:06:18.234 --> 01:06:19.367
He told me not to say anything.

01:06:19.434 --> 01:06:20.767
  So what you tell me anyway.

01:06:20.834 --> 01:06:22.167
I know.

01:06:22.234 --> 01:06:28.334
God that is so juicy. Seriously
 why didn't you tell me that?

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:36.100
 I would have told you it just
  happened during last year.

01:06:36.167 --> 01:06:38.133
 Yeah.

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:43.501
I just mean it happened during
winter.

01:06:43.567 --> 01:06:49.934
  Oh.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:55.601
  I love you.

01:06:55.667 --> 01:06:56.501
   Whatever.

01:06:56.567 --> 01:06:57.534
   Come on.

01:06:57.601 --> 01:06:59.100
 You come on.

01:07:20.334 --> 01:07:23.634
  I'm sorry.

01:07:27.467 --> 01:07:29.601
So you and Paul you have a lot
in common huh.

01:07:29.667 --> 01:07:31.601
   What do you mean?

01:07:31.667 --> 01:07:36.601
 Is Paul seeing someone else?

01:07:36.667 --> 01:07:40.100
  I don't believe so.

01:07:40.167 --> 01:07:42.667
Oh that wasn't why you wanted to
leave her then.

01:07:42.734 --> 01:07:44.367
  No.

01:07:44.434 --> 01:07:47.934
Well you're so good at it maybe
you should have given him some
 of your tips

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.367
  on breaking up with people.

01:07:49.434 --> 01:07:58.300
I made a huge mistake I'm sorry.
 I still - I'm sorry.

01:07:58.367 --> 01:08:00.767
   I don't want to hear you
  apologize.

01:08:00.834 --> 01:08:05.901
  Well I don't have any tips
 because I've never broken up
 with anyone.

01:08:05.968 --> 01:08:07.067
Really?

01:08:07.133 --> 01:08:09.701
  It's hard to believe isn't?

01:08:09.767 --> 01:08:11.601
 Well I know a stud like you.

01:08:11.667 --> 01:08:14.767
   But I mean it.  Seriously
though.

01:08:14.834 --> 01:08:15.801
   Oh yeah.

01:08:15.868 --> 01:08:17.033
Honest to God.

01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:18.334
  You are pushing it.

01:08:18.399 --> 01:08:20.634
 I had a couple girlfriends in
high school and college

01:08:20.701 --> 01:08:22.734
 and they all just fizzled out
there were no actual break ups.

01:08:22.801 --> 01:08:24.367
   You're gonna keep going.

01:08:24.434 --> 01:08:30.067
 And then I got dumped once or
twice. Then I met you. And here
we are.

01:08:30.133 --> 01:08:35.901
 Here we are.

01:08:35.968 --> 01:08:40.367
 Here we are.

01:08:45.434 --> 01:08:51.434
Are there any other things you
have to do to get ready for your
 trip?

01:08:51.501 --> 01:08:57.334
We could just take it slow try
to work through things.

01:08:57.399 --> 01:09:04.501
I'm sorry.  You told me to stop
apologizing. I don't know why I
keep doing it.

01:09:04.567 --> 01:09:07.000
  I'm not acting like myself.

01:09:10.901 --> 01:09:15.200
Peter.

01:09:15.267 --> 01:09:17.067
 Yeah?

01:09:17.133 --> 01:09:24.701
Everything that happened with us
happened for a reason.  This is
 who we are together.

01:09:24.767 --> 01:09:29.734
 We're just going to stay the
 same way it's not going to be
any different.

01:09:29.801 --> 01:09:38.300
Yeah I know.  I understand what
you're saying.

01:09:38.367 --> 01:09:44.734
   I understand you.
 This is what I want.

01:09:44.801 --> 01:09:48.667
You are the person that I have
  to be with.

01:09:48.734 --> 01:09:52.167
   Do you feel the same way?

01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:21.934
  Where are my pants?

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.167
  Oh no, I'll do it.  Sorry.

01:10:24.234 --> 01:10:32.501
It's okay.  We should uh, see if
   Highheeled Shoes is still
   playing.

01:10:32.567 --> 01:10:34.901
   Okay, that sounds great.

01:10:34.968 --> 01:10:38.734
  I'm joking.

01:10:38.801 --> 01:10:40.567
  Oh.

01:10:40.634 --> 01:10:44.767
You don't remember saying that
you'd rather have your scrotum
  nailed to a chair.

01:10:44.834 --> 01:10:48.901
You can see whatever movie you
  want, is my point.

01:10:48.968 --> 01:10:50.801
  I'm aware of that.

01:10:50.868 --> 01:10:56.033
  No I know you are I'm just
saying that whatever you're into
 that's fine with me.

01:10:56.100 --> 01:11:01.000
 No I just remember you saying
that and I thought it was funny

01:11:01.067 --> 01:11:05.000
  Right. Right. Yeah.

01:11:10.067 --> 01:11:16.100
 Well there's like five movies
 playing at the big theater in
   about three hours

01:11:16.167 --> 01:11:19.400
why don't we just go there then
 and pick on.

01:11:19.467 --> 01:11:27.067
 Okay. Maybe we could go have
brunch like an hour before the
 movie starts.

01:11:27.133 --> 01:11:28.634
You'll be hungry by then right?

01:11:28.701 --> 01:11:30.634
 I'll be fine but you haven't
eaten.

01:11:30.701 --> 01:11:32.434
Oh I'm fine I'm not that hungry.

01:11:32.501 --> 01:11:35.567
Peter you're always hungry.  And
 you won't get your meal for a
 couple hours.

01:11:35.634 --> 01:11:37.801
It's fine. I can wait. I'm fine.

01:11:37.868 --> 01:11:39.033
  You don't have to.

01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:40.934
 You just ate.
  I'm really not that hungry.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.934
Peter.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.267
 What?

01:11:55.667 --> 01:12:03.033
  I'm trying too hard 

01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:05.033
  It's okay.

01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:10.267
 Okay.

01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:47.501
Do you want me to make you some
scrambled eggs?

01:12:47.567 --> 01:12:49.133
  No I'm not hungry.

01:12:49.200 --> 01:13:05.300
 How bout a toasted pita with
cheese?
