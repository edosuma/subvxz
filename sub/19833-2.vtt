18:44.750 --> 18:46.919
and I tell you
there is great wealth there.

18:47.044 --> 18:50.840
Silver and the rewards
of war horses, swords. Land even.

18:50.965 --> 18:52.883
- MAN: And women?
- (LAUGHTER)

18:53.009 --> 18:55.261
EADRED: Oh, indeed. Women indeed.

18:55.386 --> 19:02.643
Eoferwic is a sink of corruption,
riddled with sin and lascivious women.

19:03.269 --> 19:05.896
It is a city
that will need to be scoured.

19:06.022 --> 19:08.899
Scoured by this holy army!

19:09.025 --> 19:13.070
We have the numbers. God is with us!

19:13.195 --> 19:16.657
We shall become richer
in body and soul.

19:16.782 --> 19:20.828
We shall become
the masters of Northumbria!

19:21.037 --> 19:23.622
- (MURMURS OF AGREEMENT)
- Yeah!

19:23.748 --> 19:25.458
To Eoferwic!

19:30.463 --> 19:34.050
Would you share a jug of ale with me?
Tomorrow, I must return to Wessex.

19:46.687 --> 19:49.982
You should stay.
Northumbria is your home.

19:51.108 --> 19:53.069
And Alfred is my king.

19:58.616 --> 20:00.743
You will be safe, travelling?

20:02.119 --> 20:04.163
- Who will you be riding with?
- Two men.

20:04.288 --> 20:05.581
- Warriors?
- Monks.

20:06.957 --> 20:09.460
But they will each be carrying
a heavy cross.

20:10.878 --> 20:13.672
I will be safe. I have these.

20:22.264 --> 20:25.476
They are teeth
belonging to Saint Cuthbert.

20:26.227 --> 20:30.356
They are a gift for Alfred
and my most holy protection.

20:32.149 --> 20:36.278
- Do you believe they still bite?
- No, Uhtred, I simply believe.

20:36.779 --> 20:39.073
Faith is a great comfort.

20:43.285 --> 20:45.913
- Promise you won't do anything stupid.
- (CHUCKLES)

20:46.747 --> 20:49.875
How can I make a promise
that I cannot keep?

20:50.000 --> 20:52.837
- Stupid, it's in my nature.
- Hm-hm.

20:54.922 --> 20:58.300
You must be tired of hearing my lessons,
but here's one more.

21:00.761 --> 21:04.598
You are guided by your heart
and it is a good heart.

21:04.723 --> 21:06.600
I pray it never darkens.

21:07.852 --> 21:10.479
But the Lady Gisela,
like Alfred's daughter,

21:10.646 --> 21:14.483
Aethelflaed, has a purpose.

21:14.608 --> 21:18.654
A higher purpose than need or want
or even love.

21:20.614 --> 21:23.993
I have seen what others have seen,
the attraction.

21:24.160 --> 21:25.953
She has her own mind.

21:26.078 --> 21:30.541
King Guthred may consider you a friend,
but the men close to him do not.

21:32.001 --> 21:33.669
Well, that is no hardship.

21:33.794 --> 21:37.381
You may have one ear of the king, but
they will most certainly have the other.

21:37.506 --> 21:40.009
And as you have witnessed just today,

21:40.134 --> 21:43.345
they speak well,
their words have effect.

21:45.014 --> 21:47.850
So, go carefully.

21:57.109 --> 21:58.903
I will say no more.

22:04.158 --> 22:05.701
Do not change.

22:06.952 --> 22:09.330
But try to use the mind
inside this head.

22:16.795 --> 22:18.839
UHTRED: Stay.

22:20.549 --> 22:22.968
You can be my priest at Bebbanburg.

22:23.093 --> 22:25.179
You are in need of a priest, are you?

22:29.266 --> 22:31.519

She is here still.

23:50.222 --> 23:52.641
The body of Saint Cuthbert

he and the Lady Gisela

38:29.976 --> 38:33.438
Sigefrid, we are not finished.

38:35.064 --> 38:37.150
Men will come.

38:38.318 --> 38:40.612
We will take Eoferwic back.

38:52.957 --> 38:57.587
The facts are these. Sigefrid
and his army is not beyond the Tuede.

38:57.712 --> 39:02.217
- It stands between us and Eofervvic.
- UHTRED: But it is not an anny.

39:02.383 --> 39:04.761
We are more than three times
their number.

39:04.886 --> 39:07.805
- So we kill them.
- No, we do not kill them.

39:08.806 --> 39:11.726
We must consider the battles
that lie ahead.

39:12.435 --> 39:14.812
Beyond Sigefrid is Kjartan,
beyond Kjartan is Aelfric.

39:14.938 --> 39:16.481
UHTRED: And what you must do, lord,

39:16.606 --> 39:19.734
is win the first,
and this could be done this very night.

39:19.859 --> 39:22.862
I have decided that we shall negotiate.

39:22.987 --> 39:25.990
We bargain? With an army so small?

39:26.115 --> 39:29.994
GUTHRED: The brothers and their men are
a useful addition to our own numbers.

39:30.119 --> 39:33.998
Why do you insist on inviting strangers
into the household guard?

39:34.123 --> 39:36.793
- And what of the silver?
- I have made my decision.

39:38.461 --> 39:40.213
A message has been sent.

39:43.091 --> 39:44.884
It will mean less silver.

39:45.009 --> 39:47.387
Ulf, it will mean more silver,

39:47.512 --> 39:49.722
from Eofervvic, Kjartan and Bebbanburg.

39:49.847 --> 39:53.726
Bebbanburg and what lies within it
belongs to no man but me.

39:53.851 --> 39:57.230
- You are for yourself it would appear.
- GUTHRED: Gisela?

39:57.397 --> 39:59.482
I would like you beside me
at the negotiation.

40:00.858 --> 40:02.694
Uhtred,

40:02.819 --> 40:05.863
mine is the only voice
that the brothers shall hear.

40:29.429 --> 40:30.597
(SPITS)

40:33.808 --> 40:36.769
We should be fighting, not talking.

40:47.947 --> 40:50.742
I'm Erik. This is my brother Sigefrid.

40:51.618 --> 40:53.953
I am King Guthred.

40:54.078 --> 40:56.456
How did you enjoy
your war with the Scots?

40:57.957 --> 41:00.126
- You look tired.
- ERIK: You have a name?

41:01.044 --> 41:05.548
I'm Uhtred of Bebbanburg.
The Danes know me as Uhtred Ragnarson.

41:05.673 --> 41:07.884
- You are the man who killed Ubba.
- I am.

41:08.009 --> 41:09.302
SIGEFRID: Thank you.

41:09.469 --> 41:12.639
We have benefited greatly from
Ubba's death. He has not been mourned.

41:12.805 --> 41:17.977
Danes, Northmen and Saxons.
Priests, pagans.

41:18.102 --> 41:19.228
A strange mix.

41:19.354 --> 41:23.566
GUTHRED: You might not know this,
but, in your absence,

41:23.691 --> 41:27.737
all Danes and Northmen in Eofervvic
have either been killed or fled.

41:28.738 --> 41:30.865
Eoferwic will be mine.

41:31.949 --> 41:34.118
There will be no fight, none.

41:34.911 --> 41:37.747
Unless it's with Sigefrid and Erik.

41:40.708 --> 41:44.379
I will fight you and I will win.

41:44.879 --> 41:46.339
Then why are you talking?

41:46.506 --> 41:49.008
The king is a man of the one true God.

41:49.759 --> 41:52.887
His preference is that
we come to an agreement.

41:53.012 --> 41:55.682
It will need to be a handsome agreement.

41:55.807 --> 41:57.225
Make your offer.

41:57.350 --> 42:03.022
In exchange for peace, in compensation
for the loss of Eoferwic,

42:03.147 --> 42:08.069
I will offer you a fortress. At Dunholm.

42:08.194 --> 42:10.863
- Kjartan is at Dunholm.
- GUTHRED: Yes.

42:10.988 --> 42:13.366
We will join together
and we will take it.

42:13.533 --> 42:17.161
- Kjartan's land will become your land.
- You offer nothing.

42:17.286 --> 42:19.205
Dunholm is too strong,
it cannot be taken.

42:19.330 --> 42:23.876
What I am offering you, Sigefrid,
is life. Life as an earl!

42:24.001 --> 42:28.089
The only way to defeat Kjartan
is to deny him food and freedom.

42:28.214 --> 42:31.551
We, my brother and I,
have considered this often.

42:31.676 --> 42:35.471
You would need to surround him
with men, with defences

42:35.638 --> 42:37.390
and deny him what he needs to live.

42:37.557 --> 42:42.812
Yes, all your men would need to be fed
and remain sober for months.

42:42.937 --> 42:46.733
It would take too much time
and too many men, some hundreds of men.

42:48.109 --> 42:49.986
- But it can be done?
- There are other ways.

42:50.111 --> 42:53.489
It can be done, yes.

42:58.578 --> 43:00.079
Then that is what we do.

43:00.204 --> 43:02.331
UHTRED: Lord, this is not a plan

43:02.457 --> 43:04.917
that can be decided upon quickly.
There are other ways.

43:05.042 --> 43:08.212
Uhtred, as the king explained earlier,
you do not have a voice.

43:08.337 --> 43:10.465
I will say what's on my mind
and clearly!

43:11.883 --> 43:15.219
This plan can never work.
There are other ways to defeat Kjartan.

43:15.344 --> 43:19.807
It seems everyone is wrong but you,
Uhtred Ragnarson.

43:21.934 --> 43:24.896
Do we have a plan, King Guthred?

43:26.731 --> 43:28.316
Yes.

43:28.816 --> 43:32.320
We have a plan
and we have an agreement.

43:32.487 --> 43:34.322
Do we not?

43:35.072 --> 43:36.866
We do.

43:36.991 --> 43:40.203
- Excellent.
- SIGEFRID: In addition to Dunholm,

43:40.328 --> 43:43.164
how many women will you be offering?

43:44.415 --> 43:48.336
None. Most definitely none.

43:48.461 --> 43:50.922
SIGEFRID: Your hair is unbound lady.

43:51.047 --> 43:53.257
You do not have a husband?

43:54.467 --> 43:57.011
My sister will marry
when appropriate.

43:58.888 --> 44:00.056
(CHUCKLES)

44:00.181 --> 44:01.849
GUTHRED: Excellent.

44:01.974 --> 44:05.937
Well, hopefully we will be bonded
for a long, long time.

44:11.818 --> 44:13.653
To peace.

44:14.278 --> 44:15.488
To peace.

44:42.265 --> 44:44.225
UHTRED: Once we are settled, lord,

44:44.350 --> 44:47.436
there are matters I would like
to discuss, privately.

44:47.603 --> 44:50.606
Of course,
just as soon as we're settled.

44:52.024 --> 44:55.403
EADRED: See the power
of the blessed saint, lord.

44:55.528 --> 44:57.280
In carrying him before you,

44:57.405 --> 45:01.534
he has given you this city without
a single drop of blood being shed.

45:03.160 --> 45:06.956
All that is required now
is that we praise him.

45:07.707 --> 45:10.084
Will you join me in prayer, my lord?

45:10.209 --> 45:12.461
I will, Abbot Eadred. I will.

45:28.811 --> 45:30.229
UHTRED: Sihtric.

45:34.442 --> 45:36.444
SIHTRIC: Yes, lord?

45:36.611 --> 45:40.823
Kjartan's fortress at Dunholm,
you will tell me of the weaknesses.

45:40.948 --> 45:42.325
There are none, lord.

45:46.370 --> 45:49.248
Lord, there are no weaknesses.

45:49.373 --> 45:51.876
There are always weaknesses.

45:59.216 --> 46:01.093
UHTRED: I will see for myself.

46:07.391 --> 46:09.894
EADRED: Uhtred, I believe,
is a threat to your crown,

46:10.061 --> 46:12.271
a threat even greater
than the brothers, perhaps.

46:12.396 --> 46:16.150
No. No, I do not see that.

46:18.569 --> 46:20.988
I am indebted to Uhtred.

46:21.113 --> 46:23.991
Lord, we are all in his debt.

46:25.326 --> 46:30.498
But in helping to free you,
did he not also act for himself?

46:31.457 --> 46:34.418
He believes himself
to be above each one of us

46:34.543 --> 46:36.337
and he is loved by the men.

46:36.462 --> 46:38.422
They will follow him.

46:42.301 --> 46:46.305
I have to say I worry that Bebbanburg
will not be enough for such a man.

46:47.306 --> 46:51.310
He's a warrior. Warriors crave war.

46:53.521 --> 46:59.318
Whereas we know that Bebbanburg
is quite enough for his uncle.

47:01.862 --> 47:08.077
If it were not for Uhtred, we would have
no quarrel with Aelfric. None.

47:08.202 --> 47:12.665
The opposite would apply.
He would be an ally.

47:14.291 --> 47:18.963
As for the plan to lay siege to Dunholm,
I do believe it to be sound,

47:19.088 --> 47:22.508
but it will require many further men,

47:22.633 --> 47:26.762
and they must be
men who will not be tempted

47:26.929 --> 47:29.849
to join either Sigefrid or Uhtred.

47:29.974 --> 47:31.017
Yes.

47:31.142 --> 47:34.061
May I suggest, lord,
that you summon Christian men?

47:35.062 --> 47:38.232
Christian men, yes, of course.
And from where?

47:40.151 --> 47:41.235
(SIGHS)

47:43.487 --> 47:47.241
Allow me to think on it, lord, hmm?

47:48.492 --> 47:50.619
Let us both think on it.

48:17.521 --> 48:20.024
He is a warrior now, my nephew?

48:20.149 --> 48:22.610
BROTHER TREW:
He is, lord, with a reputation.

48:22.735 --> 48:24.945
A fearsome reputation.

48:28.032 --> 48:30.409
- He talks of me?
- BROTHER TREW: Often, lord.

48:30.534 --> 48:33.287
- Oh?
- Without affection.

48:35.372 --> 48:37.666
Wants to tear me apart, no doubt?

48:37.792 --> 48:39.752
That is the impression
he gives, lord, yes.

48:44.715 --> 48:48.010
Your king's intention
regarding Bebbanburg is what?

48:48.135 --> 48:50.805
The Abbot Eadred,
who advises the king, is for peace.

48:50.971 --> 48:52.014
Mm-hmm.

48:52.139 --> 48:56.352
However, the abbot is on one shoulder,
your nephew is on the other.

48:56.477 --> 48:58.395
And Uhtred wishes me dead.

49:00.397 --> 49:02.108
He will not rest,

49:02.233 --> 49:04.151
I know it.

49:04.276 --> 49:06.570
I've always known it.

49:09.615 --> 49:12.701
We fear he covets
notjust Bebbanburg, lord,

49:12.827 --> 49:14.703
but the whole of Northumbria.

49:15.996 --> 49:20.126
- As is the way with Danes.
- AELFRIC: It is.

49:22.795 --> 49:24.296
200 spears?

49:29.260 --> 49:33.430
Tell your king, tell the abbot,

49:33.556 --> 49:35.558
I am open to an alliance.

49:35.683 --> 49:38.227
If King Guthred were to raise an army
against Kjartan,

49:38.352 --> 49:40.396
I would be prepared to add to that army.

49:40.521 --> 49:44.483
My business with the Danes
has long since finished.

49:46.235 --> 49:51.991
In return,
I shall require the head of Osbert.

49:52.158 --> 49:55.494
- Osbert, lord?
- My nephew's name is Osbert.

49:56.495 --> 50:00.332
There shall be no more talk
of Uhtred. He's not the heir.

50:00.499 --> 50:02.543
He's nothing.

50:04.086 --> 50:06.297
The head of Osbert.

50:08.507 --> 50:10.509

Yes, but you cannot be a friend

- I do.

Hild, my sword. And find Gisela!

56:27.010 --> 56:28.095
(PANTS)

56:30.764 --> 56:32.766
- Lady Gisela?
- ls it true they have taken Uhtred?

56:32.891 --> 56:35.519
- Out of the way, this is God's work.
- It is!

56:35.686 --> 56:38.772
Then you must help him,
you are his only hope!

56:42.526 --> 56:45.612
Guthred! Guthred, whatever your plans,
change them.

56:45.737 --> 56:47.781
You are to be sold.

56:47.906 --> 56:50.325
We're to be sold? Why?

56:50.951 --> 56:53.203
Lord, we are your army, we saved you!

56:53.412 --> 56:57.916
It's not lost on me that while you gave
me my freedom, I am now taking yours.

56:59.251 --> 57:01.795
- You will become a slave, Uhtred.
- No!

57:01.920 --> 57:04.214
- GUTHRED: And Halig with you.
- UHTRED: N0!

57:04.339 --> 57:06.508
No, you have no argument with Halig,
let him go free.

57:06.633 --> 57:08.176
No, lord. I will stay beside you!

57:08.302 --> 57:11.305
UHTRED: Guthred, let him go free.
I beg you! (GROANS)

57:12.848 --> 57:14.641
GUTHRED: You see?

57:14.766 --> 57:18.687
This is the reason why
you're being caged. You inspire loyalty.

57:18.812 --> 57:21.106
You inspire loyalty from my men.

57:21.231 --> 57:23.191
UHTRED: Guthred, I gave you my word.

57:23.317 --> 57:27.029
- My sword!
- But what I need is 200 swords!

57:27.154 --> 57:31.241
I need 200 men, and that is your worth.

57:31.366 --> 57:34.578
Two hundred Christian men of Bebbanburg.

57:35.954 --> 57:37.831
My uncle, Aelfric?

57:37.956 --> 57:39.374
GUTHRED: He asked for your head.

57:40.626 --> 57:43.837
But slavery will be enough, I'm sure.

57:43.962 --> 57:47.841
It would be better to kill me,
but you lack the courage.

57:48.550 --> 57:50.302
Kill me. Sword in hand!

57:50.469 --> 57:52.179
My sister would never forgive me.

57:52.304 --> 57:53.889
Kill me!

57:55.057 --> 57:58.352
Goodbye... Osbert.

57:59.853 --> 58:04.691
Guthred, you should kill me
or I will return, I swear!

58:05.776 --> 58:06.943
Guth red!

58:08.195 --> 58:09.946
Guthred, you should kill me!

58:10.864 --> 58:12.949
(GRUNTS)

58:48.026 --> 58:49.319
He is lost, Hild.

58:49.444 --> 58:51.988
I do not readily see how I can help him.

58:52.114 --> 58:54.324
- You cannot.
- But, lord...

58:54.449 --> 58:56.868
Hild, he could be across the seas
by now.

58:56.993 --> 58:59.037
It cannot be true, he is Uhtred.

58:59.705 --> 59:04.751
- Lord, I will search for him.
- For how long, Beocca?

59:04.876 --> 59:08.296
For as long as is necessary.
For a lifetime. Why not?

59:08.422 --> 59:13.468
Beocca, the task is near impossible
and, with respect, it is beyond you.

59:13.635 --> 59:16.805
- AELSWITH: He is lost, Father.
- AETHELFLAED: No!

59:16.930 --> 59:19.683
Father, it is Uhtred.

59:19.808 --> 59:22.477
- He kept us safe in the...
- Aethelflaed, shush.

59:22.644 --> 59:24.062
AETHELFLAED: He did not abandon us,

59:24.187 --> 59:26.898
- and we should not abandon...
- You will be silent now.

59:27.607 --> 59:32.112
ALFRED: My dear,
it is not that I wish to abandon him,

59:32.237 --> 59:33.989
it is how do I find him?

59:34.114 --> 59:39.494
Lord, what of his brother, Ragnar?

59:39.619 --> 59:41.455
Would he not wish to find Uhtred?

59:41.621 --> 59:44.958
And he is more capable
than Father Beocca.

59:45.083 --> 59:46.626
Yes.

59:47.127 --> 59:49.963
- Yes.
- AELSWITH: Ragnar is a hostage.

59:50.088 --> 59:51.923
And a man of his word.

59:52.048 --> 59:58.096
Could he not remain a hostage
whilst outside of Winchester?

01:00:16.531 --> 01:00:20.160
Earl Ragnar. I have a task for you.

01:00:22.537 --> 01:00:24.289
And you alone.

01:00:31.129 --> 01:00:32.422
GUARD: Move it!

01:00:33.965 --> 01:00:35.217
Move!

01:00:49.564 --> 01:00:50.649
(GRUNTS)

01:00:51.399 --> 01:00:53.276
- You are no longer a warrior.
- (YELLS)

01:00:53.401 --> 01:00:56.029
- (YELLS)
- You belong to me now.
