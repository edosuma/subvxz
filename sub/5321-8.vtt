I am not what you would call

13:53.360 --> 13:55.249
Released in 1932.

13:55.400 --> 13:58.324
It is the grandfather
of the American zombie film,

13:58.520 --> 14:00.010
starring Bela Lugosi.

14:00.160 --> 14:01.730
'White Zombie'
introduced the notion

14:01.880 --> 14:03.962
that shooting a zombie
in the chest would not kill it.

14:04.120 --> 14:06.691

on the culture.

into a monster movie

- Who can pick just one?

when the little girl turns

14:44.640 --> 14:46.529
and the mother just stares.

14:46.680 --> 14:49.809
Her baby is now a monster.

14:49.960 --> 14:52.042
Eh. It happens.

14:52.240 --> 14:54.368
What about your mother?

14:54.520 --> 14:56.841
- My mother?
- Mm-hm.

She's gone.

15:01.800 --> 15:03.450
No. Before.

15:03.600 --> 15:06.604
Oh. I'm sorry, Murphy.

15:08.040 --> 15:11.408
It's hard in this world
with no-one to look after you.

15:13.760 --> 15:16.570
Yeah, well.
I'm not him anymore.

15:19.720 --> 15:21.688
Now, this one, I did see.

15:21.840 --> 15:24.730
Scary AND funny.
That's how I liked my zombies.

15:24.880 --> 15:27.042
A satisfying remake
of the Romero classic

15:27.200 --> 15:29.282
and a stinging rebuke

15:29.440 --> 15:31.442
of America's
consumer-driven society.

15:31.600 --> 15:33.204
I get it-
zombies as consumers

15:33.360 --> 15:34.805
driven by the mindless desire

15:34.960 --> 15:37.247
to obtain useless shiny stuff,
blah, blah, blah.

15:37.400 --> 15:39.641
-(ZAPPING)
-(CRIES OUT)

15:39.800 --> 15:43.600
And to set it in
a suburban shopping mall? Genius.

15:43.760 --> 15:47.003
Romero never explained
why the dead rise.

15:47.160 --> 15:50.403
The not knowing is much more
horrifying, don't you think?

15:50.560 --> 15:53.040
The knowing
is pretty horrifying too.

15:53.200 --> 15:56.727
I get the feeling
you were often misunderstood.

15:56.880 --> 15:59.087
MURPHY: First impressions
were never my strong suit.

15:59.240 --> 16:01.607
Not very good
at second impressions either.

16:01.760 --> 16:04.206
You are unique, Mr Murphy.

16:04.400 --> 16:07.165
I can see
you are to be revered.

16:07.360 --> 16:09.647
I can see you
sitting on a throne

16:09.800 --> 16:11.689
dispensing the wisdom
of men, zombies

16:11.840 --> 16:13.604
and all that will
come after men.

16:13.760 --> 16:15.205
People will travel
great distances

16:15.360 --> 16:16.930
to be in your presence.

16:17.120 --> 16:20.329
Uneasy lies the head
that wears the crown.

16:21.520 --> 16:23.409
Has there ever been
a zombie movie that captures

16:23.560 --> 16:25.642
how exhausting and dirty
the apocalypse is?

16:25.800 --> 16:27.643
I'm filthy all the time.

16:27.840 --> 16:30.366
I blow my nose
and mud comes out.

16:30.520 --> 16:32.090
You want a shower?

16:33.120 --> 16:35.327
You have running water here?

16:36.440 --> 16:38.602
Hot water?

16:38.760 --> 16:41.650
-(WATER RUNS)
- Hot enough for ya?

16:41.800 --> 16:44.280
I hate to ask, but what happens
when this thing hits the water?

16:44.480 --> 16:46.642
Like a toaster in the tub.

16:46.800 --> 16:49.007
(LAUGHS) Kidding.
It's waterproof.

16:49.160 --> 16:50.685

16:58.120 --> 17:00.646
- Nothing but quiet.
- Nothing. No-one here.

17:00.800 --> 17:03.121
Without Murphy,
there's no mission.

17:03.280 --> 17:05.044
Keep moving.

17:05.200 --> 17:07.885
For as important as this guy is,
we sure lose him a lot.

I'm kinda their mission.

17:51.360 --> 17:54.569
Have I been talking to myself?!
You are their pawn!

17:54.760 --> 17:57.491
I am nobody's pawn!

17:59.400 --> 18:02.529
So, I'm gonna leave you two.
I'll see myself out.

18:02.720 --> 18:05.769

If the CDC wants to see you,

18:24.560 --> 18:27.166
they're gonna have to
come to me.

- How was your sleep?

18:42.440 --> 18:44.602

sure pack a punch.

18:44.760 --> 18:46.125
What are you doing to me?

18:46.280 --> 18:47.964
Getting you miked up.

18:48.120 --> 18:50.202
Oh, blood sample.

19:41.240 --> 19:44.403
his central nervous system

19:45.440 --> 19:46.885
Welcome.

19:47.880 --> 19:49.564
Thank you.

19:49.720 --> 19:51.563
It's my pleasure to be here.

19:51.720 --> 19:55.770
Mr Murphy,
I'd like to take a DNA sample.

19:55.960 --> 19:57.962
A simple swab.

19:58.120 --> 19:59.929

- Aaah!

-(CRIES OUT)

20:03.320 --> 20:05.322
I have so many questions,

20:05.480 --> 20:07.448
but the most reliable data

20:07.640 --> 20:10.166
will come from your cells.

20:11.200 --> 20:14.249
As you can see,
I'm taking a plasma sample.

20:14.440 --> 20:16.090
And...

20:17.200 --> 20:19.009
What is that for?

20:19.160 --> 20:22.243
This 6-inch needle...
8-inch needle...

20:22.400 --> 20:25.051
...is for collecting
a bone marrow aspiration.

20:25.240 --> 20:26.844
A bone marrow what?

20:27.000 --> 20:28.365
A simple test to determine

20:28.520 --> 20:29.965
whether you're more human
or zombie.

20:30.160 --> 20:31.605
Bone marrow tells you that?

20:31.760 --> 20:33.683
Won't know if you don't try.

20:33.840 --> 20:35.524
That's the best part

21:11.280 --> 21:13.806
directly from The Murphy
in an exclusive interview

21:14.000 --> 21:16.082
that will dispel the rumours
and conjecture.

21:16.240 --> 21:17.765
Can't I just pee in a cup?

21:17.960 --> 21:19.769

21:19.960 --> 21:22.122
of the life-altering,
history-making attack

21:22.280 --> 21:24.442
that left you infected
with the HZN virus.

21:24.600 --> 21:26.602
Yes, well...

21:27.600 --> 21:30.001
A few months
into the zombie outbreak,

21:30.160 --> 21:33.209
I volunteered for a secret
government research program.

21:37.520 --> 21:41.161
If you don't tell the truth,
who will?

21:44.400 --> 21:46.243
I was in prison.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.164
MURPHY: A scientist
used the prisoners

21:48.320 --> 21:50.049
as guinea pigs
to test serums

21:50.240 --> 21:52.766
to fight the zombie virus.

21:52.920 --> 21:54.763
Most of the batches
didn't work.

21:54.920 --> 21:57.605
Mine did. I think.

21:57.760 --> 22:01.162
The lab was overrun by zombies
moments later.

22:02.440 --> 22:03.965
And they left me.

22:04.960 --> 22:06.724
The zombies attacked me,

22:06.880 --> 22:09.724
bit me, tore my body open.

22:10.840 --> 22:12.365
But I did not die.

22:12.520 --> 22:14.363
What would you like to say

22:14.560 --> 22:17.769
to the unprofessional
CDC doctor

22:17.920 --> 22:19.763
who left you in that lab?

22:19.920 --> 22:22.764
- That I will keep my promise.
- What promise?

22:24.440 --> 22:25.885
I will...

22:26.040 --> 22:28.008
...hunt you down
and eat your brains!

22:28.200 --> 22:29.645
...brains.

22:31.360 --> 22:32.805
And for other zombies?

22:32.960 --> 22:34.564
Life is very simple.

driving them forward.

be something?

23:41.600 --> 23:42.931
- Wasn't that you?
- No.

that I captured you

I wasn't gonna do this.

- How? -I was at the last Comic-Con
when it all went down.

28:05.720 --> 28:09.088
Some dirty guy with a crossbow
tried to help George escape.

28:09.240 --> 28:12.528
Got eaten. I helped George
and his girls escape.

28:12.680 --> 28:14.569

It's already 800 pages.
How long does it need to be?

28:54.800 --> 28:57.929
I was thinking about typing
"The End" on the last page.

28:58.080 --> 29:00.447

making you bleed!

29:23.320 --> 29:25.607
I can see you

of men, zombies

29:28.440 --> 29:30.841

29:40.120 --> 29:41.690
DEAN: Mr Murphy.

29:45.480 --> 29:48.563
I'll cut you in for a percentage
of the gate. That's fair.

30:09.480 --> 30:12.324
OK, fine.
I can go 10% of concessions.

30:12.480 --> 30:14.323
Not counting liquor sales.

30:14.480 --> 30:17.643
I tell you what-
I'll throw in liquor sales,

20% of all concessions,
including liquor, and we split

30:40.760 --> 30:42.842
