ADULT ADAM: Back in the '80s,
my mom was famous

00:03.351 --> 00:04.787
for always getting her way.

00:04.961 --> 00:06.832
She bulldozed everyone,

00:07.007 --> 00:10.358
teachers, store employees,
even her own friends.

00:10.532 --> 00:12.795
But my mom's arm-twisting
was about to get tested

00:12.969 --> 00:14.579
when those friends
became family.

00:14.753 --> 00:16.625
Erica!

00:16.799 --> 00:18.757
I need to get a head count
for Thanksgiving dinner.

Is your mother around?

00:20.063 --> 00:21.717
[GRUNTS] 26 1/2 pounds

00:21.891 --> 00:23.936

than you think.

00:24.111 --> 00:25.416
Oof.Where do you buy
a bird that big?

00:25.590 --> 00:28.115
Oh, I've had this gobbler
since he was a chick.

00:28.289 --> 00:30.073
I'd hand-feed him
peanut butter, corn,

00:30.247 --> 00:32.423
and pasta carbonara
every day

00:32.597 --> 00:35.252

forced-gorging did what it do.

is the juiciest.

00:40.736 --> 00:42.520
Sorry to interrupt
your pet's murder,

00:42.694 --> 00:44.696
but I thought I was hosting
Thanksgiving this year.

00:44.870 --> 00:46.785
Well, that doesn't
sound right, so it isn't.

00:46.959 --> 00:48.309
And I'm already
three hours into

00:48.483 --> 00:50.659

seasoning process.

00:50.833 --> 00:53.357
So? I made little menus
with a calligraphy pen.

She calls yams "yums."

00:55.098 --> 00:56.578

my contribution.

you think it is.

she was doing
Thanksgiving this year.

She can still be a part
of the festivities.

01:04.499 --> 01:07.676
You will be scooping out
Popcorn's giblets.

his generosity,

07:13.650 --> 07:15.347
Pop-Pop, are we gonna
play the gobble-gobble game?

07:15.522 --> 07:16.740
The gobble-gobble game?

07:16.914 --> 07:18.438
You know,
our Thanksgiving tradition

07:18.612 --> 07:19.917
of handing us
your wallet

07:20.091 --> 07:21.397
and letting us gobble up
any money we find inside.

07:21.571 --> 07:22.964
That is so sweet.

07:23.138 --> 07:24.748
Is it? Is it?

07:24.922 --> 07:25.836
Now, gobble-gobble,

07:26.010 --> 07:27.272
Sure. Sure.
Here, gobble-gobble.

07:29.144 --> 07:30.580
Four bucks?
Aren't you an adult?

07:30.754 --> 07:32.190
I don't like
carrying cash.

07:32.364 --> 07:34.018
There's greasers
and doo-woppers
in my neighborhood.

07:35.411 --> 07:36.499
We're gonna
inherit nothing.

07:36.673 --> 07:38.370
Murray,
what about you?

07:38.545 --> 07:40.677
Do you have any Thanksgiving
traditions with your dad?

07:40.851 --> 07:41.765
Well, let me think.

07:41.939 --> 07:43.463
Uh... no.

07:43.637 --> 07:45.116
I'm sorry.
Did I say something wrong?

07:45.290 --> 07:46.683
No, no, no.
Everything is peachy.

That's Murray's
dry sense of humor.

He's--
He's my funny boy.

We watch
the football game together.

07:55.475 --> 07:56.780
You mean you made me
go in my room

07:56.954 --> 07:58.347
and listen to it
on the radio.

07:58.521 --> 08:00.088
So we could
compare experiences after.

08:00.262 --> 08:01.742
And after the game,
you'd go for your cigar walk.

08:01.916 --> 08:03.395
Well, sure.

Prince Murray and his asthma.

You're a liar.

an annoying kid.

mess this up for me?

08:24.199 --> 08:26.157
You had years
to play the loving dad.

08:26.331 --> 08:27.594
You messed that up
all on your own.

It's probably
for the best.

While Pop-Pop's lie
was exposed,

debase hers--

off of her.
