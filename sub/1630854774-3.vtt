WEBVTT

00:10.344 --> 00:12.471
So we flew on a PJ-- That's a private jet.

00:12.554 --> 00:14.973
'Cause I'm already COO of the company,
you know?

00:15.057 --> 00:16.099
First one under 40.

00:17.518 --> 00:20.354
But I like to say that
I'm also COO in the bedroom.

00:20.938 --> 00:21.772
That's a joke.

00:23.774 --> 00:25.317
But it is also 100% true.

00:26.610 --> 00:28.070
Will you excuse me for a minute?

00:28.153 --> 00:30.906
I might need to use the restroom.

00:30.989 --> 00:31.990
Might?

00:32.824 --> 00:33.909
Okay.

00:35.744 --> 00:38.121
- I have some feedback.
- What the fuck are you doing here?

00:38.205 --> 00:40.290
Alan, for months in our sessions,

00:40.374 --> 00:42.751
I've listened to you obsess
about ending up alone.

00:42.835 --> 00:45.671
You've described these bad dates
with superficial women

00:45.754 --> 00:48.799
- as though they're the problem?
- What is happening? Don't eat my fries.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.592
Listen, the trickiest part about therapy

00:50.676 --> 00:54.096
is that sometimes a patient
can be an unreliable narrator.

00:54.179 --> 00:56.765
So, I started to wonder if maybe
you were completely full of shit.

00:56.849 --> 00:58.600
Now I know. You're full of shit, Alan.

00:58.684 --> 00:59.810
- You need to go.
- No, no, no.

00:59.893 --> 01:02.145
This is good news,
because now we can get down to work.

01:02.229 --> 01:04.647
This guy that I was listening to,
that's not you.

01:04.730 --> 01:07.901
I want you to start letting these women
see the kind, charming,

01:08.402 --> 01:10.821
vulnerable guy
that I've met in our sessions.

01:11.446 --> 01:12.781
Here she comes.

01:12.865 --> 01:14.449
Just be you.

01:14.533 --> 01:16.326
- Fuck off.
- Be you.

01:26.503 --> 01:27.671
I cried four times today.

01:28.922 --> 01:29.923
Oh, my God.

01:37.764 --> 01:39.057
Shit! Fuck!

01:39.141 --> 01:41.435
Shit fuck? You gotta look up.

01:42.019 --> 01:44.396
I'm sorry. For being in the pool house.

01:44.479 --> 01:45.480
Excuse me?

01:45.564 --> 01:47.316
'Cause you're definitely staying
in the pool house,

01:47.399 --> 01:49.693
so there's no reason for you
to be in my kitchen.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.778
You can use regular sarcasm with me,

01:52.279 --> 01:54.156
because all that complicated shit
you just did is--

01:54.239 --> 01:55.532
I think it's a little unnecessary.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.952
I was cleaning up. Old army habit.

02:00.537 --> 02:02.706
Wait, what happened to the orchid
that was on the counter?

02:03.290 --> 02:04.791
That pot of dirt with the stick in it?

02:04.875 --> 02:08.252
I threw it out. I thought it had passed.

02:08.336 --> 02:10.088
You thought it had passed?

02:10.172 --> 02:13.217
I did. Was it a friend of yours?
I'm very sorry for your loss.

02:14.218 --> 02:16.345
Don't touch shit that's not yours.

02:16.428 --> 02:17.429
Okay.

02:18.555 --> 02:20.766
- I'ma get it out of the trash.
- No, just forget it. Just forge--

02:20.849 --> 02:23.477
It's okay. You want it, you got it.
One zombie orchid coming right up.

02:26.730 --> 02:29.816
- May I help you?
- Just looking for a dead plant.

02:29.900 --> 02:31.401
That is not your trash.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.987
Okay. Let's start over.

02:34.071 --> 02:37.950
So, my name is Sean,
and I'm guessing you're Karen?

02:38.033 --> 02:40.994
- It's Pam.
- Pam, the family knows him.

02:41.078 --> 02:43.580
Why don't you go home
and post some shit on Nextdoor

02:43.664 --> 02:45.165
on how the neighborhood's changing?

02:45.249 --> 02:46.625
He's staying with us, Pam.

02:46.708 --> 02:48.460
Were you dropping off
some welcome muffins?

02:48.544 --> 02:52.506
Wait, the guy that almost beat someone
to death is staying with you?

02:52.589 --> 02:56.552
- Jimmy, what the fuck are you doing?
- It's fine. Alice is cool with it.

02:56.635 --> 02:58.804
No, I'm not. But I agree Pam's a racist.

02:58.887 --> 03:02.391
- I'm moving into VA housing.
- Hey, you don't owe her an explanation.

03:02.474 --> 03:03.392
Why am I the bad guy?

03:03.475 --> 03:06.687
Liz and I are just trying to protect
the neighborhood.

03:07.521 --> 03:08.897
Stop. There's no "Liz and I."

03:08.981 --> 03:11.233
- You need me over here, babe?
- No.

03:11.316 --> 03:12.401
Ugh, thank God.

03:12.484 --> 03:14.236
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Hey, Derek.

03:14.319 --> 03:15.696
- Hey, Pam.
- Hey.

03:15.779 --> 03:17.781
No. There's no "Hey, Pam."
We don't like Pam.

03:17.865 --> 03:18.866
Got it.

03:19.408 --> 03:20.742
Eat a dick, Pam.

03:23.245 --> 03:24.454
I like that guy.

03:54.568 --> 03:58.322
Hey. Tia and I used to do
this hike with Gaby and her husband.

03:58.405 --> 03:59.698
That's a great story.

03:59.781 --> 04:02.284
- Give me a signal if your heart stops.
- Okay.

04:03.285 --> 04:05.037
I'll probably just go with vomiting.

04:05.662 --> 04:07.664
- Hey.
- Hey, Brian.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.082
Just on a hike with my dad.

04:09.708 --> 04:10.709
That's too mean.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.628
How do you know everybody?

04:12.711 --> 04:15.380
I live two blocks from here
and nobody's waved at me.

04:16.048 --> 04:16.882
Fuck you.

04:17.841 --> 04:19.051
That was almost a wave.

04:19.635 --> 04:21.970
How does he have friends? Seriously.

04:22.053 --> 04:23.305
Such a bad guy.

04:23.889 --> 04:26.099
Really good at punching though.
So-- So strong.

04:26.183 --> 04:28.435
Hey. Let's get some drinks tonight.

04:29.019 --> 04:30.229
We can invite Gaby.

04:30.312 --> 04:32.439
I didn't get to see her much
when you cut me out of your life

04:32.523 --> 04:34.024
for being too kind and supportive.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.652
Yeah. I haven't hung out
with her much lately either.

04:36.735 --> 04:39.530
Unfortunately without Tia,
Gaby thinks that we're old and boring.

04:39.613 --> 04:40.948
What?

04:41.031 --> 04:43.283
Well, let's show her
how we did it in college.

04:43.784 --> 04:46.453
Except for, you know, much earlier
and with way fewer drinks,

04:46.537 --> 04:50.457
and a lot less of me declaring
I'm an absolute pussy hound.

04:52.042 --> 04:53.919
- I miss straight Brian.
- Yeah.

04:54.545 --> 04:57.464
He used to say things like,
"Aren't vulvas gorgeous?"

05:00.509 --> 05:01.510
Are they not?

05:04.179 --> 05:05.472
I mean, they're all right.

05:05.556 --> 05:06.557
Yeah.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.642
They're not like,
the main attraction, or anything.

05:08.725 --> 05:10.018
- Right. Right.
- Yeah.

05:11.395 --> 05:12.604
Blood work looks good.

05:13.188 --> 05:15.566
Ah, your cholesterol has gone up a smidge.

05:16.358 --> 05:19.611
Do you remember
that talk we had about eating healthier?

05:19.695 --> 05:21.989
- I do. I ignored it.
- Terrific.

05:22.072 --> 05:24.908
It took us a while but we found
the right combination of meds.

05:24.992 --> 05:27.870
Your reflexes, motor skills,
all seem great.

05:28.453 --> 05:29.621
Good.

05:30.622 --> 05:32.124
How is your emotional health?

05:33.375 --> 05:35.878
I know what's coming, you know? I just--

05:36.920 --> 05:38.297
I try not to dwell.

05:39.923 --> 05:42.843
<i>Whenever I need it,
I put on one of my favorite sad songs</i>

05:42.926 --> 05:46.305
<i>and just let myself grieve
for 15 straight minutes.</i>

05:51.518 --> 05:55.314
<i>But once my alarm beeps, I shake it off,
and get the fuck on with my life.</i>

06:02.946 --> 06:04.781
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.742
Cute dress. What's the occasion?

06:06.825 --> 06:09.953
It's the first day with my new car.
I gotta make an effort.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.663
Yeah, I still need a name for her.

06:11.747 --> 06:12.831
I was thinking about Shadowfax,

06:12.915 --> 06:17.294
which everybody knows is the name
of Gandalf's horse in <i>Lord of the Rings</i>.

06:17.961 --> 06:20.130
- Nobody knows that.
- Okay, but that's what makes it cool.

06:20.214 --> 06:21.673
I was also considering Deborah,

06:21.757 --> 06:24.718
Mildred and Barack.

06:24.801 --> 06:26.094
But I don't know.

06:26.178 --> 06:29.765
Hey, why don't I pick you up,
and then take you to your meeting later?

06:29.848 --> 06:32.226
That way, you can see
how lil Debbie handles?

06:32.309 --> 06:34.937
Oh, shit. I just made my choice.

06:35.812 --> 06:36.813
No, thanks.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.608
I just can't listen to your music today.

06:42.319 --> 06:43.320
Cool.

06:44.029 --> 06:45.030
Have a good day.

06:45.822 --> 06:47.324
<i>â€¦The story of a girl</i>

06:47.407 --> 06:50.160
<i>Who cried a river
And drowned the whole world</i>

06:50.244 --> 06:53.330
<i>And while she looks so sad
In photographs</i>

06:53.413 --> 06:55.749
<i>I absolutely love her
When she motherfucking what?</i>

06:55.832 --> 06:57.584
<i>Smiles</i>

07:00.921 --> 07:03.257
<i>Your clothes never wear
As well the next day</i>

07:03.340 --> 07:05.801
<i>Your hair never falls
In quite the same way</i>

07:05.884 --> 07:08.512
<i>You never seem to
Run out of things to say</i>

07:08.595 --> 07:09.805
New Tesla, bitch.

07:09.888 --> 07:11.974
<i>This is the story of a girl</i>

07:12.057 --> 07:14.852
<i>Who cried a river
And drowned the whole world</i>

07:14.935 --> 07:18.188
<i>And while she looks so sad
In photographs</i>

07:18.272 --> 07:20.440
<i>I absolutely love her
When she--</i>

07:22.359 --> 07:23.777
Are you fucking serious?

07:23.861 --> 07:26.363
Oh, my God.

07:26.989 --> 07:28.782
This fucking car is brand-new.

07:30.576 --> 07:31.618
Dude!

07:33.495 --> 07:36.540
New car, huh? Nice. Were you backing up?

07:37.124 --> 07:38.333
It's not my fault.

07:38.417 --> 07:40.836
Gaby's new car's got an enormous bumper.

07:40.919 --> 07:43.088
So you're saying Debbie was asking for it?

07:44.006 --> 07:45.841
That's a great name.
She looks like a Debbie.

07:45.924 --> 07:47.259
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

07:49.344 --> 07:51.513
- Hey, talk to him.
- I don't want to.

07:51.597 --> 07:53.473
- I know, but you have to.
- Don't make me do it.

07:53.557 --> 07:54.558
Okay, you're a little dick.

07:55.267 --> 07:57.853
Paul, you think it's safe
for you to still be driving?

07:58.353 --> 08:00.022
You know? With the Parkinson's?

08:00.105 --> 08:03.817
I passed the mandatory motor skills test
a few months ago.

08:04.359 --> 08:05.694
I'm just a shitty driver.

08:05.777 --> 08:09.156
You think it's worth the risk though,
you know? I can just drive you to work.

08:09.239 --> 08:10.574
No, it's, like, way out of your way.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.201
I live a block away from you.
I can take you.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.161
You're a lot in the morning.

08:14.244 --> 08:16.079
What? Exsqueeze me?

08:16.914 --> 08:19.249
- I'll drive myself.
- Oh, my God.

08:20.542 --> 08:22.461
Hey, I think you're fun in the morning.

08:22.544 --> 08:23.545
You do? Thank you.

08:23.629 --> 08:26.798
Well, maybe next time
you can fucking say something. Okay?

08:28.050 --> 08:29.051
Sorry.

08:29.134 --> 08:31.595
I'm taking my car in. You're picking me up
later, fucker.

08:34.515 --> 08:36.517
Why did they think the Parkinson's
caused the accident?

08:36.600 --> 08:40.020
Because it can interfere with your ability
to judge distances.

08:40.102 --> 08:41.188
That blows.

08:41.270 --> 08:43.565
No, it doesn't blow,
'cause that's not what happened.

08:44.274 --> 08:46.693
I meant, it will blow. Eventually.

08:47.402 --> 08:49.112
Thank you for clarifying.

08:50.739 --> 08:53.450
So, did you do it?
Did you have your dinner with your dad?

08:53.534 --> 08:57.371
If we have dinner right now,
he'll just act like a total idiot.

08:58.121 --> 08:59.706
He might. He often does.

09:00.457 --> 09:01.458
Maybe I'll fuck it up.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.460
I'm not really a great hang right now.

09:03.544 --> 09:04.962
I wasn't gonna say.

09:05.462 --> 09:07.506
You haven't even offered me a pretzel.

09:12.594 --> 09:14.763
Everything's putting me in a shitty mood.

09:14.847 --> 09:16.723
Even a plant being thrown away.

09:16.807 --> 09:19.434
It wasn't even my mom's favorite plant
or anything,

09:19.518 --> 09:20.978
I just pictured her watering it.

09:21.603 --> 09:23.397
Grief's a crafty little fucker.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.524
Sneaks up on you.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.860
I have something you can try.

09:27.943 --> 09:30.904
Takes about 15 minutes.

09:32.364 --> 09:33.615
Are you gonna tell me orâ€¦

09:34.491 --> 09:36.577
Well, my mouth is a little dry.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.334
Stole your snacks.

10:00.851 --> 10:02.811
You look great.

10:23.415 --> 10:24.333
Hey, man.

10:24.416 --> 10:26.710
I know this is your time and you love
these workouts and everything,

10:26.793 --> 10:29.213
but I'm sort of spinning out
about something over here.

10:29.296 --> 10:32.299
- Do you mind if we leave a little early?
- I could go. Yeah.

10:37.054 --> 10:38.847
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:38.931 --> 10:41.225
- Is this new?
- Jimmy makes me fight people for money.

10:41.308 --> 10:42.559
- Hey, that-- that's not true.
- Wha--

10:42.643 --> 10:44.937
That's just some good,
clean, consensual assault.

10:45.521 --> 10:46.688
Okay. Sounds like fun.

10:48.273 --> 10:49.900
Liz, I don't know what you're doing.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.569
But I just saw a friend do some
fucked-up shit

10:52.653 --> 10:55.197
and I gotta confront her tonight,
so now's not the time.

10:55.280 --> 10:58.867
No, no. I-- I just came over
to apologize for this morning.

10:59.576 --> 11:01.411
I'm gonna stop butting into your life.

11:01.495 --> 11:02.955
Okay. Thanks, Liz.

11:03.664 --> 11:05.874
Well, I mean, I thought you'd be happier.

11:05.958 --> 11:08.585
Well, like I said,
I have some stuff on my mind.

11:08.669 --> 11:11.964
Also I don't believe in a million, billion
years you'll ever butt out of my shit.

11:12.714 --> 11:15.133
I swear on my son's life.

11:15.217 --> 11:16.802
- Which one?
- You can pick.

11:16.885 --> 11:19.263
- Connor.
- Not Connor. He's the best one.

11:20.055 --> 11:23.851
Just you watch,
I am gonna stay out of your shit.

11:24.434 --> 11:25.811
And secondly,

11:26.603 --> 11:27.604
what'd your friend do?

11:27.688 --> 11:29.439
Liz, you have a problem.

11:30.399 --> 11:33.277
It was a joke. Good night.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.530
Liz, if you turn around now,
I'll tell you what my friend did.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.201
We'll meet again.

11:45.080 --> 11:47.666
- Hey.
- Hey, Julie. Thanks for coming in.

11:47.749 --> 11:50.627
What's the emergency?
I left a drinks date for you.

11:50.711 --> 11:54.089
Well, you must not like him that much
if you left him for me.

11:54.840 --> 11:55.841
You're not wrong.

11:57.676 --> 12:00.179
Hey, look. I wanna take
the driving assessment again.

12:00.762 --> 12:02.848
- What's the rush?
- Had a little fender bender.

12:04.308 --> 12:06.310
Please, for me.

12:07.144 --> 12:09.188
Okay. Let's do it.

12:09.271 --> 12:11.398
Don't people dress up for dates?

12:11.481 --> 12:14.902
Are you sure the equipment's gonna work
with you dressed so casually?

12:14.985 --> 12:16.153
You shut up.

12:20.782 --> 12:22.659
I've never played,
but I'm a natural athlete.

12:22.743 --> 12:23.744
- So, I'm going in.
- Okay.

12:23.827 --> 12:26.663
- Well, since you're a cornhole virgin--
- I'm quite sure I'm not.

12:27.998 --> 12:29.917
Okay. Well, there's something
I want you to know.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.046
When you make it in, you have to yell,
"Cornhole," like, super loud.

12:36.423 --> 12:37.966
- That's gonna be fun.
- So fun.

12:41.887 --> 12:43.305
Hey, so who picked you up today?

12:43.805 --> 12:45.265
- What are you talking about?
- The car thing.

12:45.349 --> 12:48.352
- Who'd you end up getting to pick you up?
- Yeah. Nico picked me up.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.480
Nico is the best.

12:51.563 --> 12:53.607
- He is, yeah.
- Really, really is.

12:53.690 --> 12:55.651
Double really. One of the greats.

12:55.734 --> 12:59.947
That must be amazing to become one
with such an amazing, amazing gentleman.

13:00.030 --> 13:01.156
Are you trying to fuck Nico?

13:02.908 --> 13:04.535
I saw you kiss someone today, Gab.

13:04.618 --> 13:07.538
Okay. Jimmy--

13:08.747 --> 13:09.873
- It's not cheating.
- Really?

13:11.083 --> 13:14.920
It looked pretty-- It looked cheaty.
I mean, come on. It was like this.

13:15.921 --> 13:16.964
Don't do that.

13:18.799 --> 13:19.842
Keep your tongue in.

13:19.925 --> 13:21.426
What the fuck is going on?

13:21.510 --> 13:24.263
Look. I've been wanting to tell you this
for a while,

13:24.763 --> 13:26.807
but Nico and I are getting a divorce.

13:28.225 --> 13:29.893
Cornhole!

13:31.603 --> 13:32.855
I taught him that.

13:34.481 --> 13:35.774
Fuck.

13:35.858 --> 13:39.945
Look, compared to your shit,
this is nothing, okay. It's amicable.

13:40.028 --> 13:43.031
And now Nico's fully available
in case you still wanna hit that.

13:44.658 --> 13:45.909
Christ.

13:46.910 --> 13:49.162
How's he doing with his s--
How's he doing with his sobriety?

13:49.246 --> 13:51.707
You know, he has his ups
and downs as usual.

13:51.790 --> 13:55.627
But look, I'm kind of relieved that
this isn't my problem anymore.

13:56.587 --> 13:57.588
I'm sorry, Gab.

13:57.671 --> 13:59.715
Stop that. Stop. You're doing sad face.

13:59.798 --> 14:02.801
This is just face.
I have resting dead wife face.

14:03.677 --> 14:05.429
Why don't you say something
really exciting?

14:05.512 --> 14:07.014
I won the lottery, man.

14:07.097 --> 14:08.182
Thank God.

14:11.351 --> 14:14.146
Look, I'm gonna be okay, all right?
Just be happy for me.

14:16.023 --> 14:18.734
Cornhole!

14:18.817 --> 14:20.736
He's got the whole bar doing it.

14:20.819 --> 14:22.487
- Cornhole!
- Good game.

14:22.571 --> 14:24.489
Great game. Great game, you guys.

14:25.532 --> 14:26.825
I've become their king.

14:26.909 --> 14:29.453
Well, I just told Jimmy
that I'm getting a divorce.

14:31.205 --> 14:32.956
- Gaby.
- No, she's happy about it.

14:33.040 --> 14:36.210
- Then congrats. You look amazing.
- Oh, my God. Thank you. Thank you.

14:36.293 --> 14:38.253
- You're gonna have so much sex.
- I am.

14:38.337 --> 14:39.713
See, that's how it's done.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.405
Hello.

15:06.740 --> 15:09.159
- Hey.
- Are you-- You okay?

15:09.743 --> 15:11.161
Yeah.

15:11.245 --> 15:15.415
I'm doing this thing where I grieve hard
for 15 minutes a day.

15:15.916 --> 15:17.084
Just to get it all out.

15:17.167 --> 15:20.003
Like how I pee before bed
so I can sleep through the night.

15:20.087 --> 15:21.421
Isn't that just for old people?

15:21.505 --> 15:23.340
I think it's for people of all ages.

15:23.966 --> 15:26.635
- Okay.
- Okay. Well, I love you.

15:32.349 --> 15:33.934
Be brave! Be brave! Fuck.

15:34.434 --> 15:35.769
Every fucking time.

15:39.231 --> 15:40.232
Fuck.

15:43.694 --> 15:44.695
It's so hot.

15:46.989 --> 15:47.990
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:48.615 --> 15:49.741
Can I have some dinner?

15:52.286 --> 15:54.037
Yes. Dinner. Yes.

16:07.593 --> 16:09.553
I appreciate you trying not
to make a big deal out of this.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.096
It's so hard.

16:16.226 --> 16:17.769
- Too much.
- Yes, I know.

16:27.362 --> 16:29.948
Just can't believe there's a waiting list
for VA Housing, man.

16:30.032 --> 16:31.575
Hey, don't worry about it, all right?

16:31.658 --> 16:34.036
You'll just-- You'll stay with me
until we get it figured out.

16:34.119 --> 16:36.205
- I really appreciate this, bro.
- Yeah.

16:36.288 --> 16:38.123
Look, I appreciate you
taking the car home.

16:38.749 --> 16:39.833
I could use the cardio.

16:39.917 --> 16:42.669
Feel a little outta shape.
I been getting a little soft.

16:43.879 --> 16:46.882
- What the fuck, man? Did you just nod?
- No.

16:46.965 --> 16:49.426
You're supposed to say, "No, you don't.
You look fucking great, man."

16:49.510 --> 16:51.178
No, you don't.
You look fucking great, man.

16:51.762 --> 16:55.098
Too late, Sean. You know what, we're
gonna talk about this in our next session.

16:57.768 --> 16:59.186
Jesus Christ, Paul!

17:02.773 --> 17:04.733
I passed the driver's test again.

17:04.816 --> 17:06.777
Cool. I just shit my pants.

17:08.987 --> 17:10.821
How's it going with the people-pleasing?

17:10.906 --> 17:14.660
<i>I've, like, completely stopped
doing things to make anyone else happy.</i>

17:15.410 --> 17:18.789
Which isn't true at all
'cause I just said that to make you happy.

17:18.872 --> 17:21.750
But I'm sorry. And I'll probably
send you a-- a sorry card.

17:21.834 --> 17:24.252
Grace, go easy on yourself.
You are doing so well.

17:24.336 --> 17:26.713
You're setting boundaries.
You're being independent.

17:26.797 --> 17:28.507
You're focusing on self-care.

17:28.590 --> 17:30.801
In Vancouver,
you're-- you're kind of a badass.

17:31.385 --> 17:35.347
Shut up. Um, no, I'm ju-- I'm just
grateful that you made me leave Donny.

17:35.430 --> 17:38.809
You're the one who did the leaving,
not me. Be proud.

17:38.892 --> 17:40.602
<i>Okay. I am. I'm proud.</i>

17:40.686 --> 17:42.521
Great. All right,
and work on that people-pleasing.

17:42.604 --> 17:46.775
<i>Go fuck yourself. I'm kidding.
Or I'm-- I'm not people-pleasing. Bye!</i>

17:48.068 --> 17:49.278
And she's gone. Okay.

17:52.823 --> 17:55.367
Annie, go on in there,
and I'll be with you in a second.

17:55.450 --> 17:58.829
- Jim! Jim-Jam, what's up? Hey.
- Hey.

17:58.912 --> 18:03.709
So, I signed the divorce papers.
It's official.

18:03.792 --> 18:04.960
- That's awesome.
- Yeah.

18:05.043 --> 18:07.588
I told Brian that he would be
an embarrassment to gay men

18:07.671 --> 18:09.214
if he couldn't go out with me
two nights in a row.

18:09.298 --> 18:10.799
We're gonna swing by my place tonight,

18:10.883 --> 18:13.093
and we're gonna do a couple
of celebratory Jell-O shots.

18:13.719 --> 18:14.553
Are you in?

18:14.636 --> 18:16.722
- It's like a divorce party. Yeah.
- Yeah.

18:16.805 --> 18:19.933
I mean, I'm supposed to swing by
my friend's brain tumor bonanza first.

18:20.017 --> 18:23.604
That's fucking dark,
but you're not gonna kill my vibe.

18:24.188 --> 18:26.190
- I'll see you later. Bye.
- Okay.

18:27.274 --> 18:28.817
Annie. Hey.

18:34.031 --> 18:37.075
- Can we talk?
- I told you, I passed the test.

18:37.159 --> 18:38.744
I don't need another lecture.

18:39.328 --> 18:40.329
It's about Gaby.

18:41.496 --> 18:43.749
I was kinda looking forward to a fight.

18:43.832 --> 18:44.833
Yeah, I could tell.

18:45.959 --> 18:49.296
My mom says if I fail science,
she's taking me off the pill.

18:49.796 --> 18:53.717
But what fucking sucks is if I do go off
the pill, my acne will get bad again.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.385
Which is kind of its own birth control.

18:55.469 --> 18:58.347
Please. High school boys
don't even care if you have a face.

18:58.430 --> 18:59.431
I know.

19:01.058 --> 19:03.602
Stay out of the house.
Also, why are you even back?

19:03.685 --> 19:06.396
VA Housing didn't work out,
so I'm gonna be staying for a bit longer.

19:06.480 --> 19:07.689
Great.

19:08.315 --> 19:12.444
Well, I'm glad you're here.
I'm Summer. What's your name?

19:12.528 --> 19:13.695
Nope.

19:15.030 --> 19:16.323
Had to try.

19:16.865 --> 19:22.246
What? He's kinda cute.
I'd give him housing in my V or A.

19:23.747 --> 19:25.582
You'd do what?

19:25.666 --> 19:27.709
Okay,
I'm taking a picture of us right now.

19:27.793 --> 19:29.419
- Oh, my God.
- This is so cute.

19:29.503 --> 19:31.338
Oh, my God.

19:43.475 --> 19:45.811
Gaby wants me to go
to her divorce party tonight.

19:46.478 --> 19:48.605
- So?
- I don't wanna. Feels fake.

19:48.689 --> 19:51.567
I can assure you
Gaby is getting a divorce.

19:51.650 --> 19:52.693
It's pissing me off.

19:52.776 --> 19:56.572
Makes sense. Divorce is always hardest
on the coworkers.

19:56.655 --> 20:00.117
She's totally in denial. She's acting like
she's super psyched about it.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.244
- And I know what you're gonna say.
- No, you don't.

20:02.327 --> 20:04.663
I'm triggered because Gaby is choosing
to end a marriage

20:04.746 --> 20:07.666
- and I didn't get to make that choice.
- Okay, you did know.

20:08.250 --> 20:11.712
Come on, kiddo. You don't get to dictate
how other people grieve.

20:11.795 --> 20:15.674
So, Gaby puts on a brave face.
Who gives a shit?

20:16.258 --> 20:20.345
Me, I gotta kick and scream
for a while before I face the truth

20:20.429 --> 20:22.389
but then I face it like a hero.

20:23.849 --> 20:26.268
But you, who knows how you grieve?

20:26.810 --> 20:28.103
You haven't even begun.

20:28.187 --> 20:31.607
What are you talking about?
I've been grieving for a fucking year.

20:31.690 --> 20:33.859
No. You've been numbing.

20:35.027 --> 20:37.613
Drugs, booze, women.

20:37.696 --> 20:39.448
I told you that I stopped all that.

20:39.531 --> 20:44.661
Yeah, but you replaced it with being
overly involved in your patients' lives.

20:44.745 --> 20:48.332
I'm not sure that I can show up tonight
with a smile on my face.

20:48.415 --> 20:50.918
It's not about you. It's about her.

20:51.001 --> 20:52.044
Are you going?

20:52.127 --> 20:54.546
I wasn't invited. Thank God.

20:56.006 --> 20:58.133
But I can give you a trick
to help get through it.

20:58.967 --> 21:00.552
Takes about 15 minutes.

21:02.221 --> 21:07.392
Pick a piece of music, something
sad as hell, and just feel your feelings.

21:08.602 --> 21:13.023
Hey, Siri, play "I Know the End"
by Phoebe Bridgers.

21:13.106 --> 21:15.817
<i>Now playing "I Know the End"
by Phoebe Bridgers.</i>

21:17.486 --> 21:19.363
<i>Look, I know you think it won't work.</i>

21:19.905 --> 21:22.491
<i>But it will if you really open yourself up</i>

21:22.574 --> 21:25.077
<i>and aren't a complete chicken shit
for once.</i>

21:37.339 --> 21:39.299
Fuck you, Phoebe Bridgers!

21:41.134 --> 21:43.387
Fuck you, Phoebe Bridgers.

21:44.972 --> 21:46.181
Fuck!

21:48.475 --> 21:53.939
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
How are you already crying so hard?

21:54.022 --> 21:56.984
No. I was crying before.

21:58.777 --> 22:01.363
This one's cute. Does he have a name?

22:01.446 --> 22:03.198
Derek named him. This is Shit Rat.

22:03.907 --> 22:06.952
Yeah. 'Cause he looks like a rat
and he eats his own shit.

22:07.035 --> 22:09.663
She gets it.
He'll be renamed when he's adopted.

22:10.455 --> 22:13.458
- Or not. I mean, it's pretty perfect.
- Are you coming to my game next week?

22:13.542 --> 22:15.002
- I wouldn't miss it.
- Okay.

22:16.420 --> 22:19.631
Sweetie, are you hungry?
Did you eat enough poop?

22:20.716 --> 22:24.052
Yo, is your neighbor lady
always kinda hanging around like that?

22:24.136 --> 22:26.471
Pretty much. She took over parenting me
for a while,

22:26.555 --> 22:28.515
so I try and throw her a bone
every now and again.

22:29.099 --> 22:31.059
Watch this. Liz!

22:31.143 --> 22:34.229
I almost forgot to tell you
I got an A on my history paper.

22:34.313 --> 22:36.523
You're awesome. I knew you could.

22:37.107 --> 22:37.941
There is no paper.

22:43.280 --> 22:45.073
- I'm sorry I'm still here.
- It's fine.

22:45.157 --> 22:46.450
It's clearly not.

22:46.533 --> 22:47.534
Uh.

22:48.952 --> 22:52.956
It's not you.
I'm kind of all over the place.

22:53.540 --> 22:57.461
And I was having a good day, and then
my friend posted a pic of me smiling,

22:57.544 --> 23:00.214
and I felt kinda guilty. Andâ€¦

23:01.882 --> 23:04.092
I don't know.
It's like I shouldn't be smiling.

23:06.720 --> 23:07.721
It's a mess.

23:09.431 --> 23:10.432
I get that.

23:14.061 --> 23:16.104
Maybe just try not to throw
any more plants away?

23:17.272 --> 23:18.524
I'm sorry.

23:19.900 --> 23:22.444
But honestly,
that plant was deader than your mom.

23:24.696 --> 23:26.907
What the fuck, dude?

23:28.075 --> 23:29.493
Damn, that's brutal.

23:29.576 --> 23:32.162
Yeah. What is that? What is that
on your face? Is that a smile?

23:32.246 --> 23:33.789
I didn't even know you had teeth.

23:33.872 --> 23:35.415
- "Miss I Don't Smile."
- No, I'm not smiling.

23:35.499 --> 23:38.460
I'm Alice. I don't be smiling. This you.
I'm you right now. I'm not smiling.

23:40.504 --> 23:43.382
Gaby! I made it.

23:44.383 --> 23:48.011
When I say "Di,"
you say "vorce!" Divorce, "Diâ€¦"

23:50.013 --> 23:50.973
"â€¦vorce."

23:53.350 --> 23:55.269
You know,
you didn't have to pretend for me.

23:55.352 --> 23:56.603
I wasn't pretending.

23:58.063 --> 24:00.315
I think I-I just feel guilty.

24:02.484 --> 24:04.945
I mean, what if this whole thing
makes Nico bottom out again?

24:05.028 --> 24:06.488
Well, there's an easy solution for that.

24:06.572 --> 24:09.616
You just put your own joy aside
and stay with him forever.

24:10.617 --> 24:11.869
You win. I'll get divorced.

24:11.952 --> 24:12.953
Yes.

24:13.620 --> 24:14.621
Another one for the kid.

24:15.205 --> 24:17.499
You know what's the worst part
about this whole thing?

24:17.583 --> 24:18.417
No. Tell me.

24:19.793 --> 24:22.337
- Never mind.
- Don't do that. Just tell me.

24:23.130 --> 24:24.256
I justâ€¦

24:26.175 --> 24:27.301
I really miss Tia.

24:30.220 --> 24:31.763
I really wish she was here right now.

24:34.099 --> 24:35.142
Like, instead of you.

24:36.602 --> 24:37.644
- The fuck?
- No.

24:37.728 --> 24:42.774
I didn't-- Look, you're okay.
It's just, she was my-- my person.

24:43.358 --> 24:44.526
We shared everything.

24:44.610 --> 24:46.403
Like, she knew
what Nico's dick looked like.

24:46.486 --> 24:47.821
I know what your dick looks like.

24:47.905 --> 24:49.239
Okay.

24:49.323 --> 24:51.158
I just really fucking miss her.

24:52.743 --> 24:53.744
Yeah.

24:54.328 --> 24:56.121
See, I-I-I can't talk to you
about stuff like this.

24:56.205 --> 24:58.207
- No, no, no, no, no.
- It's wrong. No. It's not my place.

24:58.290 --> 24:59.666
It's not wrong. It's not wrong.

25:00.667 --> 25:04.129
You lost your best friend.
I can be here for you.

25:06.381 --> 25:07.549
Hey, come here.

25:11.803 --> 25:13.347
Do you really know
what my dick looks like?

25:13.931 --> 25:14.932
Yeah.

25:15.516 --> 25:18.727
Hello. Divorce party.

25:19.394 --> 25:21.688
Yeah. Probably don't need
the hat now. I'll just--

25:26.693 --> 25:27.945
What'd she say about it?

25:29.238 --> 25:30.489
Like that.

25:31.365 --> 25:33.951
It's actually-- It's like that. It's east.

25:34.826 --> 25:36.078
Doesn't make it better.

25:37.454 --> 25:40.415
All right, that should do it.
Thank you for shopping with us.

25:40.499 --> 25:41.708
Thanks. Have a good one.

25:47.673 --> 25:50.259
- Hi. Uh, I don't know if you remember me.
- Hi.

25:52.594 --> 25:53.595
Okay, tell me.

25:53.679 --> 25:54.972
Jimmy's Super Bowl parties.

25:55.055 --> 25:58.433
The neighbor.
You're very proud of your cookies.

25:58.517 --> 25:59.560
- Liz.
- Liz.

25:59.643 --> 26:02.062
- And my cookies are perfect.
- Okay. Umâ€¦

26:02.145 --> 26:04.857
You know, Alice has been telling me
how much you've been talking to her

26:04.940 --> 26:07.651
and helping her,
and she thinks you're very smart.

26:07.734 --> 26:08.986
I am.

26:09.069 --> 26:12.948
I've become very attached to Alice,
maybe too attached. I don't know.

26:13.031 --> 26:15.993
It's irrelevant. Either way,
there's something that's bothering me,

26:16.076 --> 26:20.414
but I can't go to Jimmy because I have
been way too up in his business lately.

26:20.497 --> 26:22.499
I can't imagine that for a minute.

26:22.583 --> 26:25.460
Look, I'm probably just spinning.
I mean he's only been there a few days.

26:25.544 --> 26:29.047
But I saw them together
and it seemed very flirty.

26:29.131 --> 26:32.342
I just need you to tell me
that everything's okay.

26:32.426 --> 26:36.471
- Everything's okay.
- Really? Okay. Great.

26:36.555 --> 26:39.183
I have no idea
what the hell we're talking about.

26:39.266 --> 26:41.643
The kid, Sean, living at their house.

26:45.564 --> 26:46.565
I did not know that.

26:47.149 --> 26:48.400
Well, fuck!

26:53.488 --> 26:56.325
- Hey, Paul.
- You moved a patient into your house?

26:58.035 --> 27:01.371
- Pool house.
- Do you remember what you promised me?

27:01.455 --> 27:02.789
About Alice, yes.

27:02.873 --> 27:06.960
That you would not let your
rebel therapist bullshit

27:07.044 --> 27:08.712
<i>fuck with her well-being.</i>

27:09.296 --> 27:12.299
Why is it so hard for you
to put your daughter first?

27:13.008 --> 27:16.053
Honestly, I think I'm done with you.

27:16.136 --> 27:18.680
Done-- Done with me?
What does that even mean?

27:18.764 --> 27:21.391
I don't know yet.
I just know we're not speaking.

27:21.475 --> 27:24.269
Okay, can you just let me
explain myself please?

27:25.812 --> 27:26.813
<i>Hello?</i>

27:27.856 --> 27:30.984
Are you seriously not answering me?
Do you have any idea how childish that is?

27:31.068 --> 27:33.195
I'm good with it. Goodbye.

27:33.278 --> 27:34.905
<i>No. You know what? Hold on one second.</i>

27:34.988 --> 27:36.782
What? You're all upset now about--

27:36.865 --> 27:39.159
about crossing lines
like you're not all up in my shit?

27:39.243 --> 27:42.162
<i>You think I don't know where Alice
got that 15 minutes thing from?</i>

27:42.246 --> 27:45.207
Paul, you've been talking to her
behind my back.

27:45.290 --> 27:48.001
Yeah? So what of it?
You got something to say?

27:48.502 --> 27:50.045
Yeah. You know what, I do.

27:54.675 --> 27:55.676
Thank you.

28:05.602 --> 28:06.854
It's good.

28:07.938 --> 28:10.107
Hey. Want some cake?

28:10.190 --> 28:13.569
Liz sent it over to congratulate me
on acing an imaginary history paper.

28:25.747 --> 28:26.748
Let's have some cake.

28:32.713 --> 28:34.006
Paul?

28:34.965 --> 28:36.133
Are you serious right now?

28:37.301 --> 28:40.345
You should lock your car.
Any old psycho could get in.

28:40.429 --> 28:44.141
Paul, you can't just be running around
Pasadena getting in Black women's Teslas.

28:44.224 --> 28:47.978
You mind if I hitch a ride to work
with you from now on?

28:49.354 --> 28:53.275
I-I passed my driver's test, but I--
but I wanna go out on my own terms.

28:55.402 --> 28:56.820
Like a fucking hero.

28:57.613 --> 28:59.573
- Do you wanna talk about it?
- I do not.

29:06.371 --> 29:10.000
<i>Hey, Paul. It's Jimmy.
Declining my calls again, huh?</i>

29:10.083 --> 29:13.128
And I get why you're freaked out.
I really do, but you're overreacting.

29:13.795 --> 29:15.756
Alice and Sean are getting along great.

29:16.673 --> 29:19.843
I'm starting to feel better too.
My patients are really thriving.

29:19.927 --> 29:22.513
Look, man, this thing I'm doing
is really working.

29:34.942 --> 29:35.984
I'ma call you back.

29:36.610 --> 29:39.363
Come on. Just come on.

29:40.489 --> 29:41.532
Oh, shit.
