00:00.066 --> 00:01.734
Adult adam:
<i> Anyone who grew up in</i>
<i> the '80s will tell you</i>

00:01.736 --> 00:04.470
<i> There's those</i>
<i> huge moments</i>
<i> you'll never forget.</i>

00:04.472 --> 00:07.473
<i> Mary lou retton</i>
<i> winning the gold...</i>

00:07.475 --> 00:08.574
<i> Hands across america...</i>

00:08.576 --> 00:10.642
<i> The fall</i>
<i> of the berlin wall...</i>

00:10.644 --> 00:12.378
<i> Alf eating</i>
<i> his first cat.</i>

00:12.380 --> 00:14.980
<i> But the thing</i>
<i> I remember</i>
<i> most was this...</i>

00:14.982 --> 00:15.647
<i> My first kiss.</i>

00:15.649 --> 00:18.851
<i> It was with dana caldwell,</i>
<i> the girl down the block,</i>

00:18.853 --> 00:19.918
<i> And with the</i>
<i> new school year,</i>

00:19.920 --> 00:21.286
<i> It was time to define</i>
<i> our relationship.</i>

00:21.288 --> 00:23.989
Mixtape.
It's a genius move,
pops.

00:23.991 --> 00:26.492
I can say everything
I need to say to dana

00:26.494 --> 00:28.494
Without actually
having to say it.

00:28.496 --> 00:29.495
Forget the tape.

00:29.497 --> 00:30.963
Trust me,
I know about women.

00:30.965 --> 00:34.133
If you like a girl,
you tell her
face-to-face.

00:34.135 --> 00:36.335
Here's what
I know about women...

00:36.337 --> 00:38.037
They confuse
and terrify me.

00:38.039 --> 00:39.071
I'm making a mixtape.

00:39.073 --> 00:40.939
Someone
say mixtape?

00:40.941 --> 00:42.541
It's your lucky day.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.109
You came
to the right guy.

00:44.111 --> 00:45.244
But I didn't come to you.

00:45.246 --> 00:46.078
You literally
just came to me.

00:46.080 --> 00:49.314
You can't just throw
some top 40 stuff
on a tape.

00:49.316 --> 00:50.749
You need
to tell a story,

00:50.751 --> 00:53.318
Create a narrative
about your love.

00:53.320 --> 00:54.720
All right,
first question...

00:54.722 --> 00:56.955
Is she your girl?
I don't know.

00:56.957 --> 00:57.890
I haven't seen her
all summer.

00:57.892 --> 00:59.825
She went to tennis camp.
I went to space camp.

00:59.827 --> 01:02.628
Good.
She's an athlete.
You're a nerd.

01:02.630 --> 01:07.099
First song...
Paula abdul,
<i> "opposites attract."</i>

01:07.101 --> 01:08.000
I'm listening.

01:08.002 --> 01:08.967
Next song,
we reel her in

01:08.969 --> 01:13.539
With a silky slow jam
by yours truly,
big tasty.

01:13.541 --> 01:14.807
I'm not listening.
Too late.

01:14.809 --> 01:17.743
Next song,
we go with
a classic...

01:17.745 --> 01:20.746
Def leppard's
<i> "pour some</i>
<i> sugar on me."</i>

01:20.748 --> 01:22.448
That song's nasty.

01:22.450 --> 01:23.348
Exactly!

01:23.350 --> 01:24.516
Adult adam:
<i> Nasty wasn't my style...</i>

01:24.518 --> 01:27.319
<i> So I spent</i>
<i> the entire night</i>
<i> making an epic mixtape.</i>

01:27.321 --> 01:32.691
<i> It was the perfect blend</i>
<i> of chicago, rem,</i>
<i> inxs, and weird al.</i>

01:32.693 --> 01:33.692
<i> It was pure romance.</i>

01:33.694 --> 01:36.829
And that's our first
official mixtape.

01:36.831 --> 01:39.431
I hope you like it
as much as I like you.

01:39.433 --> 01:43.635
<i> And just like that,</i>
<i> I had created</i>
<i> a piece of musical art...</i>

01:43.637 --> 01:45.003
<i> A veritable</i>
<i> love letter</i>
<i> for the ears,</i>

01:45.005 --> 01:48.574
<i> Guaranteed to</i>
<i> capture the heart</i>
<i> of any woman.</i>

01:48.576 --> 01:52.010
<i> Unfortunately, it captured</i>
<i> the heart of the wrong woman.</i>

01:52.012 --> 01:52.845
(tape switches off)

01:52.847 --> 01:54.480
Snuggle monster.
Whoa! Whoa!

01:54.482 --> 01:56.415
What's happening?
What time is it?

01:56.417 --> 01:57.182
2:00 a.M.

01:57.184 --> 01:58.317
I was just downstairs
cleaning,

01:58.319 --> 02:02.688
And I found
the mixture tape
you made for me.

02:02.690 --> 02:03.755
Oh, oh.

02:03.757 --> 02:04.923
Mom, here's the thing...

02:04.925 --> 02:06.925
I just couldn't
wait till morning

02:06.927 --> 02:10.062
To let you know
that I love you, too.

02:10.064 --> 02:10.929
Boop!

02:10.931 --> 02:12.030
Adult adam:
<i> It was</i>
<i> a rookie mistake</i>

02:12.032 --> 02:14.766
<i> To leave anything</i>
<i> lying around my house,</i>

02:14.768 --> 02:15.601
<i> But my mom</i>
<i> wasn't so crazy</i>

02:15.603 --> 02:18.904
<i> That she would</i>
<i> actually think it</i>
<i> was for her, right?</i>

02:18.906 --> 02:21.340
You're still in here,
aren't you?

02:21.342 --> 02:23.342
(whispers) love you.

02:27.013 --> 02:31.383
You got to tell her
that mixtape was
meant for dana.

02:31.385 --> 02:35.220
I can't do that.
Look how happy she is.

02:35.488 --> 02:36.655
It would shatter her
to pieces.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.290
Well,
you better
find a way,

02:38.292 --> 02:42.394
'cause you're heading down
a very dark road here.

02:42.396 --> 02:45.998
Fluffy and delicious,
just like you.

02:46.065 --> 02:47.466
Oh! Mom...

02:47.468 --> 02:49.201
Uh, listen.

02:49.203 --> 02:50.035
I need to
tell you something.

02:50.037 --> 02:54.806
Oh, sweet boy,
you've already said
it all with that tape.

02:54.808 --> 02:57.176
Truth is,
I was terrified.

02:57.178 --> 02:58.277
You're in middle school now.

02:58.279 --> 02:59.611
That's how old
barry and erica were

02:59.613 --> 03:00.812
When they stopped
loving me.

03:00.814 --> 03:03.415
But now that
you've made me
this tape,

03:03.417 --> 03:07.553
I know that you
still love your mama,

03:07.555 --> 03:09.922
And you always will.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.456
Here's the thing, mom.

03:11.458 --> 03:12.424
Adult adam: <i> Pops was right.</i>

03:12.426 --> 03:15.928
<i> It was time to</i>
<i> come clean,</i>
<i> or do this.</i>

03:15.930 --> 03:17.129
I need a copy.

03:17.131 --> 03:18.163
Why?
So...

03:18.165 --> 03:20.866
We can listen to it
at the same time.

03:20.868 --> 03:23.001
Aww.
How adorable.

03:23.003 --> 03:23.869
And you know what?

03:23.871 --> 03:25.671
Tomorrow night
after school,

03:25.673 --> 03:26.672
We're getting
milkshakes

03:26.674 --> 03:30.275
And going to that
<i> "die hard"</i> movie
you've wanted to see.

03:30.277 --> 03:32.277
<i> "die hard"!</i>
That's r-rated!

03:32.279 --> 03:34.012
No admission
without an adult.

03:34.014 --> 03:36.815
Well, you got your adult
right here, mister.

03:36.817 --> 03:39.084
Did you just
make a date
with your mother?

03:39.086 --> 03:43.388
Yes! This whole situation
is super messed up!

03:44.090 --> 03:45.757
Damn it.
Who ate all
the boo berry?

03:45.759 --> 03:49.394
I gave it to adam
'cause he's
my favorite kid.

03:49.396 --> 03:51.964
What? You can't
say that out loud.

03:51.966 --> 03:53.632
Oh, I can,
and I just did.

03:53.634 --> 03:55.534
Both of you,
look at me.

03:55.536 --> 03:56.235
Adam's my favorite.

03:56.237 --> 03:58.003
Yeah, I'm okay with it.
Me, too.

03:58.005 --> 04:01.173
Adult adam:
<i> Yep, it was</i>
<i> a dark road, all right.</i>

04:01.175 --> 04:02.374
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

04:02.376 --> 04:05.944
<i> ¶ but nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

04:08.615 --> 04:09.748
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

04:09.750 --> 04:13.452
<i> ¶ but the past keeps</i>
<i> getting clearer every day ¶</i>

04:13.454 --> 04:15.120
Adult adam:
<i> It was September 4,</i>
<i> 1980-something,</i>

04:15.122 --> 04:19.725
<i> And erica was kicking off</i>
<i> the school year</i>
<i> in a big way...</i>

04:19.727 --> 04:21.460
<i> With a fake I.D.</i>

04:21.462 --> 04:24.296
Well, nice to make
your acquaintance,
sophia lopez.

04:24.298 --> 04:26.898
Give it back.
You don't want to
share it with me?

04:26.900 --> 04:27.833
That's not very generous,

04:27.835 --> 04:29.234
Considering
you're an organ donor

04:29.236 --> 04:31.670
From the great state
of new hampshire.

04:31.672 --> 04:34.673
Forget you saw this,
understand?

04:34.675 --> 04:35.307
No can do.

04:35.309 --> 04:38.010
I have
a pornographic
memory.

04:38.012 --> 04:38.543
I want in.

04:38.545 --> 04:41.446
No way.
You can't handle
a fake I.D.

04:41.448 --> 04:42.681
You'll immediately
get caught

04:42.683 --> 04:43.515
And ruin it for everyone.

04:43.517 --> 04:46.018
Well, if you don't
help me get one,
I'm telling dad.

04:46.020 --> 04:47.686
You wouldn't.
Dad!

04:47.688 --> 04:48.287
Shut up.
Dad!

04:48.289 --> 04:50.355
You know
he always comes on
the third "dad"

04:50.357 --> 04:51.990
'cause he can't
ignore it anymore,

04:51.992 --> 04:53.091
And the man
won't be happy

04:53.093 --> 04:55.227
'cause he'll have
to walk the stairs.

04:55.229 --> 04:57.829
He hates
to walk the stairs.

04:57.831 --> 05:00.232
I don't care.
I'm not helping you.

05:00.234 --> 05:01.300
Dad!
Murray: What?

05:01.302 --> 05:04.369
Why are you
calling my name?
What do you want?

05:04.371 --> 05:06.571
The hell's
so damn important

05:06.573 --> 05:08.507
That you make me
walk the stairs?

05:08.509 --> 05:11.610
Well, I just
discovered
that erica is...

05:11.612 --> 05:13.545
Ow.
Gonna help her brother.

05:13.547 --> 05:14.546
Thank you
for your time.

05:14.548 --> 05:16.315
Adult adam:
<i> What came next</i>
<i> was a classic</i>

05:16.317 --> 05:18.016
<i> Murray goldberg</i>
<i> golden rule...</i>

05:18.018 --> 05:19.217
<i> One he said every day.</i>

05:19.219 --> 05:21.920
Okay, whatever
you two are up to,

05:22.221 --> 05:23.989
I'm not bailing you out.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.691
Both: Understood.

05:27.093 --> 05:27.659
Yeah.

05:27.661 --> 05:30.062
Guess I'm downstairs
for the rest of the day.

05:30.064 --> 05:33.031
Adult adam:
<i> While barry's year</i>
<i> was looking up,</i>

05:33.033 --> 05:35.567
<i> I was about to</i>
<i> lock it down with dana.</i>

05:35.569 --> 05:37.602
So, do you want to ride
our bikes later?

05:37.604 --> 05:39.304
I found a dead snake
and I was wondering

05:39.306 --> 05:41.640
If you wanted to poke it
with a stick or something.

05:41.642 --> 05:42.974
Actually, um,
a bunch of people

05:42.976 --> 05:44.276
Are going
to laserium tonight.

05:44.278 --> 05:46.178
You know,
the laser-light show.

05:46.180 --> 05:47.779
Do you want
to go together?

05:47.781 --> 05:50.582
Adult adam:
<i> I had a perfect opening</i>
<i> to take pop's advice</i>

05:50.584 --> 05:53.585
<i> And be honest</i>
<i> with my special lady.</i>

05:54.487 --> 05:56.722
<i> Instead, I did this.</i>

05:56.823 --> 05:58.657
Here. Got to go.

05:58.825 --> 05:59.424
It's a mixtape!

05:59.426 --> 06:03.462
<i> The good news was</i>
<i> I had a date</i>
<i> with dana caldwell.</i>

06:03.464 --> 06:04.663
<i> The bad news...</i>

06:04.665 --> 06:05.864
<i> I was double booked.</i>

06:05.866 --> 06:07.699
Who's ready
for our movie date?

06:07.701 --> 06:09.234
I bought a new sweater.

06:09.236 --> 06:13.538
Yeah, I was thinking,
about our date...

06:13.806 --> 06:17.142
Maybe we can hang out
on Saturday instead?

06:17.144 --> 06:18.643
Really?
Yeah!

06:18.645 --> 06:19.811
Make a whole day of it.

06:19.813 --> 06:22.614
Pack a picnic,
hit the park,

06:22.616 --> 06:23.448
Get a paddle boat.

06:23.450 --> 06:26.685
I mean, I don't want
to be stuck in
some movie.

06:26.687 --> 06:27.586
I want to talk,

06:27.588 --> 06:31.289
Find out what
makes you tick,
really dig in.

06:31.291 --> 06:32.858
What do you think?

06:32.992 --> 06:34.993
Holy (bleep)
I love that idea!

06:34.995 --> 06:37.462
I love it.
(both laughing)

06:37.764 --> 06:38.797
Great.

06:38.799 --> 06:39.631
See you on Saturday.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.333
Adult adam:
<i> While I was spinning</i>
<i> my web of lies,</i>

06:41.335 --> 06:45.103
<i> My brother and sister</i>
<i> were working on</i>
<i> a deception of their own.</i>

06:45.105 --> 06:47.572
Uh, with double prints,
your film comes out
to $17.23.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.241
<i> Before the age</i>
<i> of digital cameras,</i>

06:49.243 --> 06:51.109
<i> You actually</i>
<i> had to venture</i>
<i> across town</i>

06:51.111 --> 06:54.579
<i> To get your pictures</i>
<i> from a creepy guy</i>
<i> in a vest.</i>

06:54.581 --> 06:55.313
There's your pictures.

06:55.315 --> 06:58.083
Nice pecs.
What do you do,
high weight, low reps?

06:58.085 --> 07:00.419
Yeah.
I do arms on
weekends,

07:00.421 --> 07:01.153
Legs on Thursday.

07:01.155 --> 07:03.622
Let me do the talking.
Of course.

07:03.624 --> 07:05.257
Hi.
Hey.

07:05.259 --> 07:06.525
Remember me?

07:06.527 --> 07:07.092
Sophia lopez.

07:07.094 --> 07:10.395
I was here last week.
I want a fake I.D.,
okay?

07:10.397 --> 07:11.897
(chuckles)

07:11.899 --> 07:12.864
You a cop?

07:12.866 --> 07:14.232
You wearing a wire,
buddy? Huh?

07:14.234 --> 07:16.034
What's that strap?
What's down here?

07:16.036 --> 07:18.069
All right,
if you are
wearing a wire

07:18.071 --> 07:20.005
And I catch you,
you have to retire

07:20.007 --> 07:21.940
From the force that day
without a pension.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.175
That's the law.

07:23.177 --> 07:23.842
Nobody's wearing a wire,

07:23.844 --> 07:26.812
And you should
probably read
a law book.

07:27.246 --> 07:27.879
Hmm.

07:27.881 --> 07:29.181
All right,
let's do this.

07:29.183 --> 07:31.216
Step into the cutout.

07:31.484 --> 07:33.084
Step into the future.

07:33.086 --> 07:34.352
This is so high-tech.

07:34.354 --> 07:35.153
Yes, it is exciting.

07:35.155 --> 07:37.656
All right, smile.
And three, two, one.

07:37.658 --> 07:38.523
Dude,
what are you doing?

07:38.525 --> 07:40.258
No. Just act normal.
Lose the hat. Come on.

07:40.260 --> 07:42.994
But zeus alexander
washington always
wears a hat.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.696
Oh, no.
That's your name?

07:44.698 --> 07:45.564
That's too many
letters, dude.

07:45.566 --> 07:46.765
That's too weird.
It's too stupid.

07:46.767 --> 07:48.767
I like my second choice
better anyway...

07:48.769 --> 07:49.935
James bond.
Taken.

07:49.937 --> 07:51.002
Barry bonds.
Also taken.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.370
Barry fakington!
What's wrong with you?

07:52.372 --> 07:54.606
Just pick
a normal name
already.

07:54.608 --> 07:56.208
Barry goldberg!
That's your name.

07:56.210 --> 07:58.577
Erica goldberg.
Idiot, that is my name!

07:58.579 --> 08:00.946
Sir richard chamberlain.
Stop panicking!

08:00.948 --> 08:01.613
Mr. Clock table!

08:01.615 --> 08:03.582
Now you're just saying
things that you see.

08:03.584 --> 08:06.184
I'll pick you a name,
dude, all right?

08:06.186 --> 08:09.588
Adult adam: <i> And just</i>
<i> like that, barry</i>
<i> had his new identity.</i>

08:09.590 --> 08:11.256
<i> Carlos del monaco</i>

08:11.258 --> 08:12.691
<i> Of mehoopany,</i>
<i> pennsylvania.</i>

08:12.693 --> 08:14.559
<i> As barry was getting</i>
<i> a new identity,</i>

08:14.561 --> 08:16.194
<i> I was still</i>
<i> getting up the nerve</i>

08:16.196 --> 08:18.530
<i> To find out</i>
<i> where I stood</i>
<i> with dana.</i>

08:18.532 --> 08:21.099
<i> Luckily,</i>
<i> she made it</i>
<i> easy for me.</i>

08:21.101 --> 08:23.335
I listened
to the mixtape.

08:23.337 --> 08:25.904
Oh. Did you like it?

08:25.906 --> 08:28.240
I played it
like four times.

08:28.407 --> 08:29.641
You're a good boyfriend.

08:29.643 --> 08:30.609
Adult adam: <i> There it was.</i>

08:30.611 --> 08:32.677
<i> Proof that if you never</i>
<i> speak your feelings,</i>

08:32.679 --> 08:35.347
<i> Eventually,</i>
<i> the other person will.</i>

08:35.648 --> 08:37.516
<i> That night,</i>
<i> I was walking on air,</i>

08:37.518 --> 08:40.085
<i> And nothing</i>
<i> could bring me down.</i>

08:40.087 --> 08:40.652
Hi, shmoopy.

08:40.654 --> 08:42.320
Beverly: Did you
kids have fun?

08:42.322 --> 08:44.356
For sure.
Totally.

08:44.358 --> 08:45.590
Well, everybody
buckle up,

08:45.592 --> 08:48.860
'cause we're about
to take a musical
journey...

08:49.729 --> 08:51.129
With a special
mixtape...

08:51.131 --> 08:52.464
No! No! No! No!
No! No! No!

08:52.466 --> 08:54.366
...From my number-one guy.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.101
Adam: <i> Hey, it's me.</i>

08:56.103 --> 08:57.702
<i> I made this tape</i>
<i> special for you,</i>

08:57.704 --> 09:00.438
<i> And all the songs on it</i>
<i> remind me of us,</i>

09:00.440 --> 09:01.473
<i> Especially this one,</i>

09:01.475 --> 09:02.674
'cause you're
my inspiration.

09:02.676 --> 09:07.379
<i> ¶ you know our love</i>
<i> was meant to be</i>

09:08.548 --> 09:09.514
(whispers)
is that my mixtape?

09:09.516 --> 09:14.386
<i> ¶ the kind of love</i>
<i> to last forever</i>

09:14.787 --> 09:15.987
Oh, balls.

09:15.989 --> 09:19.558
<i> ¶ and I want you</i>
<i> here with me</i>

09:19.560 --> 09:21.893
You too, dana.
It's fine.

09:21.895 --> 09:22.928
What's going on?

09:22.930 --> 09:24.529
Why does your mom
have my mixtape?

09:24.531 --> 09:25.764
(music stops )
oh, you're confused.

09:25.766 --> 09:31.670
Um, adam made me
that tape because
I'm the inspiration.

09:31.837 --> 09:32.604
What?

09:32.606 --> 09:34.372
I thought
I was the inspiration.

09:34.374 --> 09:36.074
You are.
Beverly: Uh...

09:36.076 --> 09:37.409
I'm the inspiration.

09:37.411 --> 09:39.177
Those words
are on that tape, yes.

09:39.179 --> 09:42.347
So, then,
who's the
inspiration, adam?

09:42.349 --> 09:43.281
Yeah, adam.
Who is the inspiration?

09:43.283 --> 09:47.018
Did you give
me and your mom
the same mixtape?

09:47.153 --> 09:49.621
Okay, both of you
like to laugh,

09:49.623 --> 09:51.723
So you'll appreciate this.

09:51.725 --> 09:53.158
(chuckles)

09:53.160 --> 09:54.092
Yes.
This is weird.

09:54.094 --> 09:57.362
I'm just gonna go
grab a ride with
my friends.

09:57.364 --> 09:59.331
No!
Yeah, bye, dana.

09:59.333 --> 10:00.165
Don't go.

10:00.167 --> 10:02.367
I made the tape
for you, okay?

10:02.369 --> 10:04.069
But my mom
thought it was for her

10:04.071 --> 10:05.670
Because she's
a freaking lunatic!

10:05.672 --> 10:08.506
I was just trying to spare
her crazy feelings!

10:08.508 --> 10:12.210
Well, I'm glad
you spared her feelings.

10:12.278 --> 10:16.214
Adult adam:
<i> I had seriously pissed off</i>
<i> my girlfriend.</i>

10:16.216 --> 10:16.781
(door closes)

10:16.783 --> 10:20.051
<i> But maybe I could still</i>
<i> salvage things with my mom.</i>

10:20.152 --> 10:21.286
So...

10:21.288 --> 10:23.154
Is <i> "die hard"</i>
still an option?

10:23.156 --> 10:26.358
Adult adam: <i> Yeah, no.</i>
<i> Not happening.</i>

10:27.760 --> 10:28.760
Whoo!

10:28.762 --> 10:31.630
Guess who
just turned 25!

10:31.731 --> 10:32.998
Carlos del monaco.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.733
Who wants
spray paint,

10:34.735 --> 10:36.001
Lottery tickets?

10:36.003 --> 10:37.936
I can vote, rent a car,

10:37.938 --> 10:39.871
Lease a junior
one-bedroom apartment.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.473
I'm all man,
all the time!

10:41.475 --> 10:44.042
All right, party's over.
Give me your fake I.D.

10:44.044 --> 10:46.244
Fake I.D.?
Where are you
getting this?

10:46.246 --> 10:49.147
I don't know.
Maybe 'cause
you've literally shown it

10:49.149 --> 10:50.682
To every student
in school.

10:50.684 --> 10:54.019
I have been trying
to ignore you all day.

10:54.021 --> 10:55.954
So, I got carried away.

10:55.956 --> 10:56.655
Come on, coach meller.

10:56.657 --> 10:58.857
You remember the rush
of having a fake I.D., right?

10:58.859 --> 11:01.493
Ah, geez, all right.
Just don't let me
see it again.

11:01.495 --> 11:03.294
You got it.
These lips are zipped.

11:03.296 --> 11:06.631
Yo. You the dude
with the fake I.D.?

11:06.633 --> 11:07.832
Yes, I am.

11:07.834 --> 11:10.669
Carlos del monaco
at your service.

11:10.671 --> 11:12.303
I'm throwing an
end-of-the-summer bash

11:12.305 --> 11:13.271
At my place, seniors only,

11:13.273 --> 11:14.305
But you can come
if you score us some beer.

11:14.307 --> 11:17.809
(scoffs) I can get you
all the beers you
want, young man.

11:17.811 --> 11:19.911
How many beers
we talking? Huh?
Huh? Huh?

11:19.913 --> 11:21.513
Five? 10?

11:21.515 --> 11:23.682
Ten cases
should be enough.

11:23.684 --> 11:24.149
Ten cases?

11:24.151 --> 11:26.751
Entire senior class
is counting on you,
buddy.

11:26.753 --> 11:29.120
Don't let us down.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.156
You got it.

11:31.158 --> 11:32.157
You got it.

11:32.159 --> 11:33.258
I'm gonna get
the entire senior class

11:33.260 --> 11:37.095
Totally loaded tonight
with this little beauty
right here.

11:37.097 --> 11:39.798
No, you're not.
Damn it!

11:40.566 --> 11:41.700
Dana. Wait.

11:41.702 --> 11:44.035
Look, I know
you've been avoiding me,

11:44.037 --> 11:47.439
But we've got to talk
about what happened.

11:47.441 --> 11:48.807
Okay. Talk.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.875
Adult adam: <i> Seemed like</i>
<i> my only option</i>
<i> was to finally do</i>

11:50.877 --> 11:54.245
<i> What pops said</i>
<i> and speak from</i>
<i> the heart.</i>

11:54.647 --> 11:56.715
<i> Or try</i>
<i> the tape thing again.</i>

11:56.717 --> 11:59.317
Oh, I've made you
a new mixtape.

11:59.319 --> 12:00.719
Only for you.

12:00.721 --> 12:01.519
"adam's sorry jams"?

12:01.521 --> 12:03.688
Every title
has the word
"sorry" in it.

12:03.690 --> 12:04.656
That's great,
and if I lose that,

12:04.658 --> 12:07.092
I can always
get the other copy
from your mom.

12:07.094 --> 12:07.926
(chuckles)
funny stuff.

12:07.928 --> 12:11.029
But we're still on
for laserium
Saturday, right?

12:11.031 --> 12:13.264
I think
I just need
some space.

12:13.266 --> 12:15.133
Space?
Totally get it.

12:15.135 --> 12:17.268
You're talking to the dude
that went to space camp.

12:17.270 --> 12:19.604
Adult adam: <i> Even though</i>
<i> all the women in</i>
<i> my life were mad at me,</i>

12:19.606 --> 12:23.708
<i> At least I could turn</i>
<i> to a sweet cereal</i>
<i> ghost for comfort.</i>

12:23.710 --> 12:25.777
Ah, boo berry.

12:26.946 --> 12:28.113
Adult adam: <i> Or not.</i>

12:28.115 --> 12:29.814
Aw, dang it.
No more boo berry.

12:29.816 --> 12:30.782
Beverly: Oh, I'm sorry.

12:30.784 --> 12:32.617
I gave the last
of it to erica.

12:32.619 --> 12:35.253
Looks like
I'm the favorite kid now.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.288
It won't last long,
but I'm enjoying it.

12:37.290 --> 12:38.857
Here you go,
pumpkin loaf.

12:38.859 --> 12:41.693
And you...
Enjoy your tuna!

12:41.695 --> 12:44.429
I know how well
it keeps on
long school days.

12:44.431 --> 12:48.099
Adult adam: <i> If I ever wanted</i>
<i> boo berry or my</i>
<i> mother's love again,</i>

12:48.101 --> 12:50.969
<i> I had to give my mom</i>
<i> a sincere apology...</i>

12:50.971 --> 12:53.671
<i> That I meant</i>
<i> for someone else.</i>

12:55.941 --> 13:00.078
Hey, I made this
for you special.

13:00.279 --> 13:02.380
"adam's sorry jams."

13:02.382 --> 13:03.915
Aww.

13:04.550 --> 13:06.184
Sweet gesture.

13:06.186 --> 13:08.920
Where's the case?
The case?

13:08.922 --> 13:09.721
Oh, no case.

13:09.723 --> 13:12.524
I wanted the music
to speak for itself.

13:12.526 --> 13:15.493
What's that
case-shaped
thing in your pocket?

13:15.495 --> 13:17.662
That's my uno deck.

13:17.664 --> 13:18.296
I...

13:18.298 --> 13:20.665
I have
a big tournament
at school.

13:20.667 --> 13:21.766
Got to go.

13:21.768 --> 13:22.400
Aah! Ooh-ooh-ooh!

13:22.402 --> 13:24.235
I know you made that
mixture tape for dana!

13:24.237 --> 13:26.738
No boo berry
for you
ever again!

13:26.740 --> 13:28.907
Adult adam: <i> As bad</i>
<i> as things were for me,</i>

13:28.909 --> 13:30.642
<i> They were</i>
<i> even worse</i>
<i> for barry.</i>

13:30.644 --> 13:33.211
There you go, mur-man.
Frosty cold one.

13:33.213 --> 13:36.047
I didn't ask for this.
What do you want?

13:36.049 --> 13:36.447
Nothing.

13:36.449 --> 13:38.683
I just thought
I'd bring my old man
a bottle of suds.

13:38.685 --> 13:41.452
Speaking of,
how many of those
bad boys are in a case?

13:41.454 --> 13:44.722
24.
Damn it.
That's so many beers.

13:44.724 --> 13:47.592
I mean,
there's only four here.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.160
Why don't
we cruise down
to wawa

13:49.162 --> 13:50.328
And buy you
a whole bunch more?

13:50.330 --> 13:52.363
I'm not gonna
buy you beer, moron.

13:52.365 --> 13:54.465
(sputters) pardon me?

13:54.467 --> 13:56.768
That's not what
I'm asking you for.

13:56.770 --> 13:57.235
I'm just...

13:57.237 --> 14:00.972
I'm looking for a fun
father-son activity,
you know?

14:00.974 --> 14:04.509
Like...
Like buying beer.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.444
Or making beer.

14:06.512 --> 14:07.679
That'd be fun, right?

14:07.681 --> 14:08.980
Let's go buy
some yeast and barley

14:08.982 --> 14:11.282
And start bonding
in the bathtub.

14:11.284 --> 14:11.749
Okay...

14:11.751 --> 14:14.819
Whatever stupid thing
you're up to,

14:14.821 --> 14:15.987
I am not bailing you out.

14:15.989 --> 14:17.188
I know you
always say this,

14:17.190 --> 14:18.957
But let's just
pretend for
one second

14:18.959 --> 14:21.159
I did something real stupid.

14:21.161 --> 14:21.659
I can do that.

14:21.661 --> 14:23.828
Isn't it your
legal responsibility

14:23.830 --> 14:25.897
As my father
to bail me out?

14:25.899 --> 14:27.999
No. It's my responsibility

14:28.001 --> 14:32.203
To make you face
whatever dumbass decision
you made head on,

14:32.205 --> 14:34.505
Even if it kills you.

14:34.507 --> 14:36.107
I'm a good dad.

14:36.109 --> 14:39.377
Adult adam: <i> Barry didn't get</i>
<i> what he wanted</i>
<i> out of my dad.</i>

14:39.379 --> 14:44.949
<i> But turns out</i>
<i> he got what he wanted</i>
<i> out of my dad's wallet.</i>

14:48.087 --> 14:49.420
Whoo!

14:49.422 --> 14:51.222
This should get me
through the night.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.457
I love beer.

14:52.459 --> 14:53.892
This is all for you?

14:53.894 --> 14:55.159
Sure is.

14:55.161 --> 14:57.295
Missus is a yapper.

14:57.297 --> 14:59.597
So... You're murray goldberg.

15:00.132 --> 15:00.565
Yeah.

15:00.567 --> 15:03.268
Work down at
the old furniture store.

15:03.270 --> 15:04.869
Have the three kids
back at home.

15:04.871 --> 15:08.573
I call 'em morons,
but I secretly love them.

15:08.575 --> 15:12.277
So, you're telling me
that you're almost
50 years old?

15:12.279 --> 15:13.745
I just look young.

15:13.747 --> 15:16.481
Got a bit of a baby face.

15:16.483 --> 15:18.349
I'm half hawaiian.

15:18.550 --> 15:20.118
<i> Aloha.</i>

15:20.653 --> 15:22.220
Okay, murray.

15:22.222 --> 15:24.155
When's your birthday?

15:24.223 --> 15:26.124
Oh, I should know this.

15:26.126 --> 15:27.825
Damn it!

15:28.260 --> 15:30.395
Obviously, I, uh...

15:30.397 --> 15:30.962
I drink a lot.

15:30.964 --> 15:33.264
You do know that
your father comes
in here every morning

15:33.266 --> 15:35.833
For a cup of coffee, right?
No, I did not.

15:35.835 --> 15:38.436
I think I'm gonna
ring up your father.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.638
Thank you for your time.

15:43.542 --> 15:45.176
Adult adam:
<i> It was Friday night.</i>

15:45.178 --> 15:47.011
<i> Dwayne martin's</i>
<i> senior party.</i>

15:47.013 --> 15:49.113
<i> Even though</i>
<i> barry lost his fake I.D.</i>

15:49.115 --> 15:50.081
<i> And my dad's real one,</i>

15:50.083 --> 15:53.284
<i> He was still</i>
<i> determined</i>
<i> to be the hero.</i>

15:53.419 --> 15:56.120
You are in
so much trouble!

15:56.122 --> 15:56.454
Dad?

15:56.456 --> 16:00.591
If you think I'm gonna
let you go into that party
with a bag full of...

16:00.593 --> 16:02.293
Sandwiches?
Where's the beer?

16:02.295 --> 16:03.995
There is no beer.

16:03.997 --> 16:04.762
But I went to lee's hoagies

16:04.764 --> 16:07.265
And bought cheesesteaks
and patty melts and heroes.

16:07.267 --> 16:10.501
Why?
'cause when you arrive
to the party with a hero,

16:10.503 --> 16:12.971
They'll think
you're a hero.

16:12.973 --> 16:15.940
And another name
for a hoagie is a hero!

16:15.942 --> 16:18.276
And I want to be a hero!

16:18.278 --> 16:19.844
You're a moron!

16:19.846 --> 16:20.445
I know.

16:20.447 --> 16:23.848
I mean, you spent
their beer money
on sandwiches?

16:23.850 --> 16:24.682
What's wrong with you?

16:24.684 --> 16:27.085
Just wanted this year
to be different.

16:27.087 --> 16:28.686
You know, for...

16:28.688 --> 16:29.954
For once,
I want to go to a party

16:29.956 --> 16:31.789
Where people were actually
excited to see me.

16:31.791 --> 16:33.725
(door opens)
dwayne: Yo!

16:33.727 --> 16:35.393
Adult adam:
<i> The moment had arrived.</i>

16:35.395 --> 16:36.327
<i> Collars were popped,</i>

16:36.329 --> 16:38.963
<i> Which meant</i>
<i> tension was high.</i>

16:41.333 --> 16:42.266
<i> My dad had a choice.</i>

16:42.268 --> 16:45.803
<i> He could do what</i>
<i> he always said</i>
<i> and not bail barry out,</i>

16:45.805 --> 16:48.740
<i> Or he could do this...</i>

16:49.742 --> 16:50.575
Damn it, barry!

16:50.577 --> 16:55.513
If you think you can take
this ice-cold, delicious beer,

16:55.515 --> 16:58.282
Some of it
very expensive
from germany,

16:58.284 --> 16:59.717
You got
another thing coming!

16:59.719 --> 17:03.421
It's a good thing
I came here!
Let's go!

17:03.423 --> 17:04.322
Fight the power,
carlos.

17:04.324 --> 17:08.893
Adult adam: <i> My brother</i>
<i> may have failed,</i>
<i> but my dad gave him a victory.</i>

17:09.294 --> 17:10.795
(cheering)

17:13.699 --> 17:15.566
Hey, honey.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.735
You okay?

17:18.337 --> 17:21.339
Kids used to make me
stuff like this all the time.

17:21.341 --> 17:24.342
I used to think
I'd need a bigger box.

17:24.476 --> 17:25.643
Guess not.

17:25.645 --> 17:31.015
You do know that
no son makes
a mixtape for his mom.

17:31.017 --> 17:34.519
I guess I just
wanted it to be true.

17:34.521 --> 17:38.423
I don't want adam
turning out horrible
like the others.

17:38.425 --> 17:41.559
Honey, he's a teenager.
They're all horrible.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.995
But it's just so hard,
you know?

17:43.997 --> 17:44.996
I mean,
when they're young,

17:44.998 --> 17:46.697
They just love you
so much.

17:46.699 --> 17:49.834
And then they grow up
and they don't.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.903
Hey, adam loves you.

17:51.905 --> 17:53.037
The fact that
he didn't tell you

17:53.039 --> 17:56.741
The truth about the tape
just shows you how much.

17:56.743 --> 17:59.744
But when it comes
to him and dana,

17:59.746 --> 18:01.345
You got to stay
out of it.

18:01.347 --> 18:04.215
Oh, my god.
You're right.

18:04.217 --> 18:06.451
Guess I kind of made it
more complicated for him.

18:06.453 --> 18:10.221
He's a smart kid.
He'll figure it out.

18:10.223 --> 18:10.888
You're right.

18:10.890 --> 18:13.958
I have to help him
figure it out.

18:14.326 --> 18:16.627
What? No.
Don't get involved.

18:16.629 --> 18:18.062
Yes. Get involved!

18:18.064 --> 18:22.700
Make a grand gesture
to help win dana back
for my little boy!

18:22.702 --> 18:23.434
What's happening?

18:23.436 --> 18:26.237
Are we even having
the same conversation?

18:26.239 --> 18:27.538
Don't do that!

18:27.540 --> 18:28.639
I am gonna do that!

18:28.641 --> 18:30.775
Dad, you are the best.
Mwah!

18:30.777 --> 18:32.910
(laughing) I'm gonna do it!

18:32.912 --> 18:37.915
<i> ¶ baby, you're the meaning</i>
<i> in my life</i>

18:37.917 --> 18:40.685
<i> ¶ you're the inspiration</i>

18:40.687 --> 18:42.019
<i> ¶ you bring me meaning</i>
<i> to my life ¶</i>

18:42.021 --> 18:44.655
Adam: Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
Adam?

18:44.657 --> 18:46.524
We need to talk.

18:47.059 --> 18:49.427
If you got another tape,
just leave it.

18:49.429 --> 18:52.029
No. No more tapes.
Just words.

18:52.031 --> 18:55.032
I should've
just told you
how I felt, okay?

18:55.034 --> 18:56.667
Told you that
I really like you.

18:56.669 --> 19:00.872
Told you that
I never felt this
way about anyone.

19:00.874 --> 19:01.706
And...

19:01.708 --> 19:04.342
I'd do anything
to be your boyfriend.

19:04.344 --> 19:06.711
Adult adam: <i> I didn't know</i>
<i> if she was buying it,</i>

19:06.713 --> 19:09.313
<i> Then this happened.</i>

19:10.682 --> 19:13.451
<i> ¶ you should know</i>

19:13.585 --> 19:16.387
<i> ¶ everywhere I go</i>

19:16.889 --> 19:18.890
<i> ¶ always on my mind</i>

19:18.892 --> 19:20.324
<i> ¶ in my heart, in my soul ¶</i>

19:20.326 --> 19:22.660
I can't believe
you did this.

19:22.761 --> 19:25.496
Yeah. It's unbelievable.

19:26.532 --> 19:29.700
<i> ¶ you're the inspiration</i>

19:29.702 --> 19:32.737
<i> ¶ you bring feeling to my life</i>

19:32.739 --> 19:36.073
<i> ¶ you're the inspiration</i>

19:36.075 --> 19:36.908
(softly) thank you.

19:36.910 --> 19:38.309
<i> ¶ want to have you</i>
<i> near me</i>

19:38.311 --> 19:42.847
<i> ¶ I want to have you</i>
<i> hear me sayin'</i>

19:42.915 --> 19:45.082
<i> ¶ no one needs you</i>
<i> more than I need you</i>

19:45.084 --> 19:46.450
Oh, my god.
How did you pull this off?

19:46.452 --> 19:48.219
I guess
I just know
the right person.

19:48.221 --> 19:50.388
Adult adam: <i> Turns out</i>
<i> my mom broke into the</i>
<i> control booth</i>

19:50.390 --> 19:54.892
<i> And terrified the engineer,</i>
<i> but she actually saved me.</i>

19:55.661 --> 19:59.664
So, you're finally
the hero.

19:59.666 --> 20:01.432
I hope it felt good.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.668
Yep.
Thanks to you.

20:03.670 --> 20:05.002
You know, after
all that big talk,

20:05.004 --> 20:07.104
In the end,
you still rescued me.

20:07.106 --> 20:08.573
Well, don't
get used to it.

20:08.575 --> 20:10.575
It'll never happen again.

20:10.577 --> 20:11.142
Come on.

20:11.144 --> 20:12.910
We both know
you'll always
bail me out.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.612
No, I won't.
Yes, you will.

20:14.614 --> 20:16.681
No, I won't.

20:16.882 --> 20:18.616
Yes, you will.

20:18.618 --> 20:19.884
(sighs)

20:19.886 --> 20:21.619
Yes, I will.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.387
But don't tell
the others.

20:23.389 --> 20:25.256
<i> ¶ always on my mind</i>

20:25.258 --> 20:27.525
<i> ¶ no one needs</i>
<i> you more than I</i>

20:27.527 --> 20:29.360
Adult adam:
<i> That's the thing</i>
<i> about parents.</i>

20:29.362 --> 20:32.263
<i> No matter how hard</i>
<i> we make it for them,</i>

20:32.265 --> 20:34.599
<i> They always bail us out.</i>

20:38.470 --> 20:39.637
Adam: <i> Hi, dana.</i>

20:39.639 --> 20:40.638
(dinging)

20:40.640 --> 20:43.341
<i> I never thought</i>
<i> I'd say this,</i>
<i> but I love you,</i>

20:43.343 --> 20:45.543
<i> And remember,</i>
<i> you're the everything,</i>

20:45.545 --> 20:48.112
<i> And here's the</i>
<i> song by r.E.M.,</i>

20:48.114 --> 20:50.348
<i> "you are the everything."</i>

20:50.350 --> 20:52.116
There you go.
A new boat, huh?

20:52.118 --> 20:53.284
Your wife
loves to water ski.

20:53.286 --> 20:57.388
I like the one-piece,
but the bikini
really works on her.

20:57.390 --> 20:58.256
How you doing,
old-timer?

20:58.258 --> 21:00.091
My granddaughter,
sophia lopez,

21:00.093 --> 21:02.860
Said that
you might know
how to fabricate

21:02.862 --> 21:04.662
An identification.

21:05.163 --> 21:07.531
Let's just say
I could do such a thing.

21:07.533 --> 21:08.833
Why would
a distinguished
gentleman

21:08.835 --> 21:10.901
Like yourself
require such an item?

21:10.903 --> 21:12.303
Let's just say

21:12.305 --> 21:14.272
I told a younger
woman I was 60

21:14.274 --> 21:15.306
And need a way to prove it.

21:15.308 --> 21:17.508
Can you help?
It depends.

21:17.510 --> 21:18.209
Are you a cop?

21:18.211 --> 21:19.877
Because if you lie
and bust me,

21:19.879 --> 21:20.578
Not only do
I go free,

21:20.580 --> 21:22.713
I get to keep
your badge
for a year.

21:22.715 --> 21:24.982
That's the law.
I have $200 cash.

21:24.984 --> 21:27.084
Step into the cutout.
