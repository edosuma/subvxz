Is Eep trapped in a hole?

That doesn't seem possible.

Yeah, once you put up some cave paintings,
get rid of that carcass over there...

It's a "car-put."

So, how about I tell you a story instead?

who was also quite handsome...

and really good at cave painting,
as it turns out.

And he had a magic tail

how this could be confusing, but still.

on the person next to you.

Sorry, but as a good babysitter,

you can have Krispy Bear back
when you've learned to play nice.

13:48.411 --> 13:51.831
And I thought I was living
on borrowed time.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.374
[chuckling]

13:53.458 --> 13:55.418
[laughing]

13:56.669 --> 13:57.962
- Mm-hmm.
- [Thunk cheering]

13:59.714 --> 14:01.841
Hey, who wants to help me clean?

14:01.924 --> 14:07.096
It's totally fun, and I'm totally
telling the truth and not lying!

14:07.180 --> 14:10.308
Can't right now.
We're watching our stories.

14:10.391 --> 14:14.187
Dirk is spinning a web...
a web of lies!

14:14.270 --> 14:15.480
[gasping]

14:15.563 --> 14:19.859
He's about to defeat his arch-rival.
Gran, are you seeing this?

14:20.651 --> 14:22.862
- [shrieking]
- [gasping]

14:22.945 --> 14:27.575
Hey, buddy, hope you enjoy eating me.
Let me know if I can do anything to help.

14:27.658 --> 14:28.993
[groaning]

14:29.077 --> 14:30.745
I've seen enough!

14:30.828 --> 14:33.373
Ugga, I'm taking Thunk
somewhere incredibly dangerous

14:33.456 --> 14:35.708
where he'll toughen up or die!

14:35.792 --> 14:38.586
Uh-huh. Great. Have fun!

14:38.669 --> 14:42.590
You know, that'll rot your brain...
if it bites you.

14:42.673 --> 14:44.967
Happened to a buddy of mine.

14:45.051 --> 14:48.679
What about you, Sandy?
You want to help your old man clean?

14:48.763 --> 14:50.681
You can eat all the dirt we find.

14:50.765 --> 14:52.892
[Sandy whirring]

14:56.396 --> 14:57.855
[both] No!

14:57.939 --> 15:00.608
Ah! Sorry! How do I reverse this?

15:02.860 --> 15:03.861
[hacking]

15:08.991 --> 15:10.118
[grumbling]

15:10.201 --> 15:12.245
At least the cave's clean?

15:14.080 --> 15:17.834
- Thunk, you like old people, right?
- Not just like. I love them.

15:17.917 --> 15:22.880
Well, if you want to ever be
an old person, you've got to get tough.

15:22.964 --> 15:28.803
That's why, when I was your age,
we did the trials of the tar pits.

15:28.886 --> 15:32.974
- The kids who passed got to grow up.
- And the kids who failed?

15:33.057 --> 15:35.893
The kids who passed got to grow up.

15:37.228 --> 15:38.729
- Hey!
- Hey, guys!

15:38.813 --> 15:41.149
Are you here to help me with my trials?

15:41.232 --> 15:42.358
[grunting]

15:42.442 --> 15:46.028
Wow! But let's see you do that
with two hands.

15:46.112 --> 15:47.572
[shrieking]

15:48.114 --> 15:51.117
That was fun.
So, when do the trials start?

15:51.200 --> 15:52.285
[groaning]

15:52.368 --> 15:59.375
Gorp was the first trial. We'll come back
to that later. Now, let's toughen you up.

16:00.835 --> 16:02.211
[sizzling]

16:09.177 --> 16:10.428
[giggling]

16:11.262 --> 16:12.597
[hurling]

16:14.932 --> 16:16.517
[sighing]

16:16.601 --> 16:18.853
Mm... ooh.

16:21.147 --> 16:21.981
[gasping]

16:22.064 --> 16:24.400
Look, Gran! Hot stone massage.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.402
[grumbling]

16:26.486 --> 16:27.945
- [growling]
- [grunting]

16:30.114 --> 16:33.701
Who's a good boy?
You are. Yes, you are.

16:34.577 --> 16:35.870
[grumbling]

16:37.497 --> 16:39.582
[straining]

16:42.585 --> 16:43.961
[giggling]

16:45.087 --> 16:46.506
- [hissing]
- [screaming]

16:50.384 --> 16:53.387
And they said I couldn't lift
my own body weight.

16:53.471 --> 16:56.182
Take that, everyone I know.

17:02.939 --> 17:04.065
- [grunting]
- [yelping]

17:07.193 --> 17:10.570
Thanks, Gran,
but I don't know how to get out.

17:10.655 --> 17:13.074
Well, I guess this is my life now.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.617
[growling]

17:24.042 --> 17:25.419
[both] Yay!

17:25.502 --> 17:28.005
Nice work, my boy.

17:28.631 --> 17:30.967
Look, I'm sorry I ruined your stories,

17:31.050 --> 17:35.555
but I'll find you a new show to watch,
like, um... these butterhummers.

17:35.638 --> 17:36.681
[buzzing]

17:36.764 --> 17:40.393
They just fly around looking pretty.
Where is the drama?

17:40.476 --> 17:43.604
Okay, okay.
Well, buzztles have a lot going on.

17:43.688 --> 17:46.399
Too much going on.
I can never keep the names straight.

17:46.482 --> 17:49.777
Dad, the story of Dirk's romance
is special.

17:49.860 --> 17:54.156
Even though he and Flit are in love,
they can never be together.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.908
Really? Why?

17:55.992 --> 18:01.455
He was a spider ant. She was a gnat fly.
They were from different worlds.

18:01.539 --> 18:03.499
Huh. Tell me more.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.334
- Betrayal.
- Passion.

18:05.418 --> 18:09.171
[Eep] He was in a cocoon.
[Ugga] Love at first sight.

18:09.255 --> 18:13.009
And then, she left him hanging
by a thread of spider silk!

18:14.844 --> 18:15.678
Ah!

18:15.761 --> 18:20.266
- We know. It's shocking.
- No. Look! What?

18:20.349 --> 18:21.726
[cheering]

18:21.809 --> 18:23.102
I can't believe it!

18:23.185 --> 18:27.189
[laughs] We can find out
if Dirk and Flit live happily ever after!

18:27.273 --> 18:28.566
Ow, you little...!

18:28.649 --> 18:29.734
[gasping]

18:30.526 --> 18:31.902
Uh...

18:32.737 --> 18:34.280
At least the cave's clean?

18:35.197 --> 18:39.118
Doing great, Thunk. I think you're ready
to rematch old Gorp here.

18:41.203 --> 18:43.331
Do I have to? Gorp's my friend.

18:43.414 --> 18:46.917
Oh... that's sweet.
Now, less lip and more flip!

18:47.335 --> 18:48.711
[grunting]

18:52.381 --> 18:53.424
[yelping]

18:57.178 --> 18:58.178
[groaning]

18:59.263 --> 19:01.307
- Oh, yeah.
- Go ahead.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.560
- [panting]
- You tired him out. Finish him!

19:07.605 --> 19:09.106
I can't flip you, Gorp.

19:09.190 --> 19:13.611
What if I hurt your hip and you're never
able to hold your lizard grandson again?

19:13.694 --> 19:15.071
- [shrieking]
- Ha-ha!

19:15.154 --> 19:16.364
I still got it.

19:16.447 --> 19:22.536
Darn it, Thunk. Again with this sweetness.
I thought you were finally toughening up.

19:22.620 --> 19:26.916
You want to know what happened
to the kids who didn't pass the trials?

19:26.999 --> 19:28.834
They lived long and happy lives?

19:28.918 --> 19:32.380
No! They died young,
with all their hair on their head

19:32.463 --> 19:36.050
and their short-term memory
and their hair on their head!

19:36.133 --> 19:38.135
And so will you!

19:38.219 --> 19:41.347
[whimpers] You're wrong!
I'm a different kind of tough.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.891
I will get old, even older than Weez!

19:43.974 --> 19:49.271
Older than Weez? Good luck!
I knew dirt back when it was still a rock.

19:49.355 --> 19:50.355
[back cracking]

19:51.273 --> 19:53.776
That's what I get for being cocky.

19:55.194 --> 20:00.408
Thunk, stop! I'm going to catch up.
We both know I'm tougher than you.

20:00.491 --> 20:05.496
So, maybe you are, but I don't need
your dumb trial of the armpits.

20:05.579 --> 20:09.625
It's "trials of the tar pits"!
Because this area is full of...

20:09.709 --> 20:10.835
- [shrieking]
- Thunk!

20:10.918 --> 20:12.044
tar pits!

20:12.128 --> 20:13.921
Thunk, grab hold!

20:14.004 --> 20:16.966
I don't need your help.
I can get out of this mess.

20:17.049 --> 20:20.720
You're not tough enough.
Let the old lady do the heavy lifting.

20:21.345 --> 20:22.346
[screaming]

20:24.056 --> 20:26.142
Well, I don't know about you,

20:26.225 --> 20:30.479
but I'm going to take a moment
to think of my final words.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.857
Yeah, got them.

20:32.940 --> 20:38.028
No, no, no!

20:39.363 --> 20:42.867
With no show to watch,
I guess we'll just watch reality.

20:42.950 --> 20:45.494
Ugh! I hate this reality show!

20:45.578 --> 20:47.496
- Not so fast!
- [gasping]

20:47.580 --> 20:48.414
Dirk!

20:48.497 --> 20:52.460
It's a shocking twist. That wasn't Dirk.
It was his evil twin Donk!

20:52.543 --> 20:56.797
Dirk was hiding under a rock
with his true love Flit the whole time!

20:56.881 --> 20:58.466
[shrieking]

20:58.549 --> 20:59.800
[giggling]

20:59.884 --> 21:01.302
And the best part...

21:01.385 --> 21:04.513
we're upgrading to a big screen!

21:05.848 --> 21:06.848
[straining]

21:06.891 --> 21:09.435
Stop thrashing!
It's making us sink faster.

21:09.518 --> 21:11.771
Is not!
[continues straining]

21:14.315 --> 21:19.278
Who am I kidding? We're goners!
And look who's circling again.

21:19.361 --> 21:24.825
Scram, you! The tar pits won our bodies
fair and square. You lose.

21:24.909 --> 21:26.744
Don't talk to Bessie like that!

21:26.827 --> 21:27.661
[gasping]

21:27.745 --> 21:29.705
Talk to her like this.

21:29.789 --> 21:32.208
Bessie! Hey, Bessie!

21:32.291 --> 21:35.377
Bessie, who's the Bessie?
Who's the Bessie-Bessie?

21:35.461 --> 21:39.423
Hey, Bessie boy! Bessie girl!
You're the Bessie girl!

21:39.507 --> 21:43.594
Stop that! Do you want that mangy bird
to scavenge our corpses?

21:43.677 --> 21:47.640
No, I want her to rescue our corpses
while they're still alive.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.892
- [Bessie shrieking]
- Oh!

21:51.560 --> 21:55.272
That worked! No violence required.

21:55.356 --> 21:59.193
Thanks, Bessie.
We owe you one. One corpse, that is.

21:59.276 --> 22:00.611
[cawing]

22:03.113 --> 22:07.743
Thunk, you really are sweet,
and it turns out that's a good thing.

22:07.827 --> 22:13.332
I didn't appreciate it before,
but now I am certain you get it from me.

22:14.875 --> 22:20.172
That's nice. Reminds me,
back in my day, when... And there I go!

22:20.256 --> 22:22.925
Bye, Weez! Have fun with your new friend!

22:24.134 --> 22:26.178
[laughing]

22:27.930 --> 22:29.557
Hey, what are you watching?

22:29.640 --> 22:33.143
Shh. It's the season finale.
Dirk and Flit are getting married.

22:33.227 --> 22:35.437
Flit looks so beautiful.

22:36.647 --> 22:39.984
Oh, I've already seen this one.
The fly dies in the end.
