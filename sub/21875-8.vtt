00:08.870 --> 00:11.600
You think that's crazy?
You never met Glucose.

00:11.610 --> 00:13.440
Glucose?

00:13.440 --> 00:15.240
Nickname.
He'd shoot up anything.

00:15.240 --> 00:16.610
One time
he couldn't score,

00:16.610 --> 00:18.480
he got some instant coffee,

00:18.480 --> 00:20.280
boiled it down
dropped it in a spoon.

00:20.280 --> 00:21.810
Blammo.

00:21.820 --> 00:22.980
What happened?

00:22.990 --> 00:25.250
Nothin'.
It was decaf.

00:25.250 --> 00:26.690
( all laugh )

00:28.820 --> 00:30.820
Man, was he ticked.

00:32.030 --> 00:33.560
Okay, boys,

00:33.560 --> 00:36.630
time to get down
to brass tacks.

00:38.900 --> 00:41.270
You can take three keys
up to Amarillo.

00:42.140 --> 00:43.240
Dusty,

00:43.240 --> 00:45.170
I want you to take
another five

00:45.170 --> 00:47.140
down to Marty
in Houston.

00:47.140 --> 00:49.440
Don't be late.

00:49.450 --> 00:50.840
He might
slit your throat.

00:50.850 --> 00:54.050
That's his way of warning
you for next time.

00:54.050 --> 00:55.680
Rubin and I
are going to Fort Worth

00:55.680 --> 00:57.850
with the rest of the stuff.

00:57.850 --> 00:59.850
Meet you boys back here
tomorrow night,

00:59.860 --> 01:02.390
divide up the cash.

01:02.390 --> 01:03.960
By this time tomorrow,

01:03.960 --> 01:05.360
we'll be smokin' Havanas

01:05.360 --> 01:08.060
and drinkin' the finest
Kentucky whiskey ever made.

01:09.460 --> 01:11.360
Rubin, you're gonna have
enough money

01:11.370 --> 01:13.400
to buy any woman you want.

01:13.400 --> 01:15.500
And you thought this deal
wouldn't go down.

01:15.500 --> 01:18.100
Well, you boys
should've listened to him.

01:18.110 --> 01:19.170
What the...?

01:19.170 --> 01:21.070
Who the hell are you?

01:21.080 --> 01:23.080
Walker, Texas Ranger.

01:24.510 --> 01:27.410
Well, you boys made
two big mistakes.

01:27.420 --> 01:29.550
One: smuggling drugs.

01:29.550 --> 01:32.190
And two: doing it in Texas.

01:32.190 --> 01:33.890
Didn't you boys know
the Texas Rangers

01:33.890 --> 01:34.960
would be coming down on you?

01:36.430 --> 01:37.420
Hm?

01:37.430 --> 01:39.190
Oh, yeah?

01:39.190 --> 01:40.590
Where the hell
are they?

01:40.600 --> 01:42.860
Well,
you're looking at him.

01:42.870 --> 01:44.330
You saying
you're here alone?

01:46.430 --> 01:48.300
That's what I'm sayin'.

01:48.300 --> 01:49.340
( all laugh )

02:00.350 --> 02:03.150
I want you boys
to listen up real careful.

02:03.150 --> 02:04.750
You have the right
to remain silent.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.120
And you have the right
to stuff it.

02:06.120 --> 02:07.220
Oh!

02:07.220 --> 02:08.860
WALKER:
Shut up, Billy Joe.

02:12.030 --> 02:14.800
Anything you say
can and will be used against you

02:14.800 --> 02:17.460
in a court of law.

03:23.160 --> 03:25.800
Yes, sirree, take a look
at this old gal.

huh? Huh?

Absolutely, Jimmy.
Absolutely.

03:37.980 --> 03:39.910
"My idea of a good--"

03:39.920 --> 03:41.310
What's the news?

03:41.320 --> 03:43.920
Well, Alex is pushing hard
for the judge not to set bail,

03:43.920 --> 03:45.950
but the chances are,
Billy Joe McArthur's gonna walk

03:45.950 --> 03:47.120
right out of this arraignment.

03:47.120 --> 03:49.190
Well, you done the best
you could, son.

03:49.190 --> 03:50.960
Come on over here
and take a look at this thing.

03:50.960 --> 03:52.290
This thing is amazing.

03:52.290 --> 03:54.090
It'll get your mind
off McArthur.

03:54.100 --> 03:55.830
I got a date
on this sucker.

03:55.830 --> 03:58.430
Yep, old Jimmy
set it up.

03:58.430 --> 03:59.430
Cordell, do you know

03:59.430 --> 04:01.530
these things are run
on telephone wires?

04:01.540 --> 04:03.700
Yes, sir,
telephone wires.

04:03.710 --> 04:06.110
Seems like a lot of trouble
to go through for a date, C.D.

04:06.110 --> 04:08.710
Some of us don't have
the pick of the litter, Cordell.

04:08.710 --> 04:11.450
We have to take
other measures.

04:11.450 --> 04:13.410
Oh, this one's looking
pretty good to me.

04:13.420 --> 04:14.780
Yep. She and I
are gonna have lunch,

04:14.780 --> 04:16.480
and she's gonna wear
a red dress.

04:16.490 --> 04:19.620
But the question is, what's
gonna be in that red dress?

04:19.620 --> 04:22.060
Cordell, details.
Details.

04:22.060 --> 04:23.060
Ranger Walker.

04:23.060 --> 04:24.290
Oh, hi, Evie.
I--

04:25.290 --> 04:26.590
I'm sorry, Walker.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.000
Bail was set, and McArthur
was ready for him.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.030
I tired to get the judge
to make it higher,

04:31.030 --> 04:32.830
but you know the drill.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.430
Does the judge know
what's gonna happen?

04:34.440 --> 04:35.840
Billy Joe's gonna be
out of the state

04:35.840 --> 04:37.340
before he even gets
his robe off.

04:37.340 --> 04:39.340
I used every argument
I could think of.

04:39.340 --> 04:41.540
Your testimony
was terrific.

04:44.750 --> 04:45.750
Mwah.

04:49.280 --> 04:51.820
Top of the mornin'
to you, Ranger.

04:51.820 --> 04:55.220
Seems like as long
as I've been doing this,

04:55.220 --> 04:57.660
I'd stop taking it all
so personally.

05:02.830 --> 05:05.100
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

05:08.300 --> 05:09.870

Just a statement
real quick

05:09.870 --> 05:11.170
about how it feels
to be set free.

05:11.170 --> 05:13.470
BILLY JOE:
I feel great about it.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.270
Yo, Walker!

05:15.280 --> 05:17.240
MAN:
Yeah, remind me, will ya?

05:21.780 --> 05:23.880
Now, didn't I tell you
it'd be a whole lot harder

05:23.890 --> 05:26.190
for you to put me away than
it would be for me to get out?

05:29.830 --> 05:31.690
I love this court system.

05:31.690 --> 05:34.490
Next time you'll get a judge
who believes in justice.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.330
You won't get me
next time.

05:36.330 --> 05:37.830
Don't count on it.

05:39.730 --> 05:41.500
Seems nowadays
every damn criminal

05:41.500 --> 05:43.140
loves this court system.

05:43.140 --> 05:44.970
Uh, Ranger Walker?

05:44.970 --> 05:46.340
I'm sorry
to interrupt you.

05:46.340 --> 05:48.340
Just, uh-- A messenger came by
this afternoon,

05:48.340 --> 05:49.640
brought this for you.

05:49.650 --> 05:52.350
I just figured you
oughta get it right away.

05:52.350 --> 05:54.610
He seemed to think
it was pretty important.

05:54.620 --> 05:55.880
Thanks, Evie.

05:55.880 --> 05:58.250
See you in church,
Ranger!

06:02.790 --> 06:05.060
I'm just so glad
I caught you,

06:05.060 --> 06:07.160
'cause he seemed to think
you should get it right away.

06:27.350 --> 06:28.820
( man yells
indistinctly )

06:35.490 --> 06:36.490
You okay?

06:36.490 --> 06:38.860
Yeah. Check them.

06:38.860 --> 06:39.930
You okay?
I think--

06:39.930 --> 06:41.860
I think I'm okay. I--

You're fine.

06:50.740 --> 06:51.740
Are you all right?

06:51.740 --> 06:52.740
Yeah, I'm okay.

( indistinct shouting )

06:57.210 --> 06:59.110
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

07:11.430 --> 07:13.090
Maybe you should
go to the hospital.

07:13.090 --> 07:14.090
No, I'm okay.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.560
Just to get it
looked at.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.560
The medic just looked at it.
I'm okay, Alex.

07:17.570 --> 07:19.430
You're so stubborn.

07:21.470 --> 07:23.570
So have you ever heard
of this Ranger Bodine?

07:23.570 --> 07:25.940
No. Whoever he is,
he's no Texas Ranger.

07:25.940 --> 07:27.170
Whoever he is,
he doesn't care

07:27.180 --> 07:29.040
who he kills or hurts
in the process.

07:29.040 --> 07:31.980
Let me ask you somethin'.
You think this guy just
had a thing for Billy Joe?

07:31.980 --> 07:34.480
No. He addressed
the envelope to me.

07:34.480 --> 07:36.680
Whatever he wants,
it's personal.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.890
Let's get out of here.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.570
Hi.

09:32.370 --> 09:34.870
Okay, I've gone back
30 years,

09:34.870 --> 09:36.900
and I found five Rangers
named Bodine.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.610
Now,
four of them are dead,

09:38.610 --> 09:42.140
and the other lives in Plainview
with his daughter.

09:42.140 --> 09:44.110
None of them
are named Samuel.

09:44.110 --> 09:46.210
I guess that doesn't
surprise me.

09:46.210 --> 09:48.920
Okay, Evie,
I want you to go back

09:48.920 --> 09:51.280
and check all applications
for the Rangers

09:51.290 --> 09:53.290
and the sheriff's
department.

09:53.290 --> 09:55.520
Go back
a couple of years.

09:55.520 --> 09:58.930
Um, did you want me
to do that now?

09:58.930 --> 10:00.190
I-- I mean, tonight?

10:00.200 --> 10:01.960
Is there a problem?
What's the matter, Evie?

10:01.960 --> 10:04.660
Uh-- Um, it's just that, um,

10:04.670 --> 10:06.670
Tommy was gonna call me,
and--

10:06.670 --> 10:10.040
Tommy? I love it.
Evie's got a boyfriend.

10:10.040 --> 10:11.870
Yeah, I knew you had it
in you, girl.

10:11.870 --> 10:13.710
( giggles )

10:13.710 --> 10:14.970
Oh...

10:14.980 --> 10:16.740
He's not my boyfriend.

10:16.750 --> 10:20.150
I mean, he sure likes me,
but I don't know why.

10:20.150 --> 10:21.650
Hey, hey, what kind of talk
is that?

10:21.650 --> 10:23.220
He likes you
'cause you're a great gal.

10:23.220 --> 10:26.020
You need a little
confidence booster, girl.

10:26.020 --> 10:27.120
Who sent you
the rose?

10:27.120 --> 10:28.890
He sent it to me.

Look-- Okay.

10:29.890 --> 10:31.060
( chuckles )

10:31.060 --> 10:32.490
I'll make a deal with you.

If you'll work on this Bodine
case for two more hours,

10:35.800 --> 10:39.030
if Tommy calls,
you can take off early, okay?

10:39.030 --> 10:40.970
Okay, great.

and everything.

for you this afternoon.

10:49.180 --> 10:51.510
Well, I'll be.
Petey Cevera.

10:51.510 --> 10:52.550
Who's Petey Cevera?

10:52.550 --> 10:54.610
Do you remember
a couple of years ago

10:54.620 --> 10:57.220
there was this family
named Carver,

10:57.220 --> 10:59.220
who was wiped out in what
they thought was a drug war?

10:59.220 --> 11:01.220
Is that the one where the guys
went to the wrong house?

11:01.220 --> 11:02.460
That's the one.

11:02.460 --> 11:05.120
Well, Petey Cevera
was the one that set up the hit,

11:05.130 --> 11:07.260
and then he disappeared
afterwards without a trace.

11:08.430 --> 11:09.860
Until now.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.400
Till now.

11:31.150 --> 11:32.290
Why don't you
go around back.

11:32.290 --> 11:33.550
All right.
I'll be at the front.

Yeah,
we've seen that before.

it's a great gimmick,

Walker.

13:48.790 --> 13:51.590
<i> ♪ To make you mine ♪</i>

13:53.860 --> 13:58.630
<i> ♪ What can I say</i>
<i> To make you mine? ♪</i>

14:08.610 --> 14:10.410
I'm sorry.
Are you all right?

14:11.510 --> 14:12.910
Trivette,
that's Petey Cevera!

14:18.850 --> 14:20.290
Good job, partner.

14:20.290 --> 14:21.890
Okay, let's go.

14:26.730 --> 14:29.660
Now, I wonder how long
he wants us to stay down here.

14:30.800 --> 14:31.800
Hey, Ranger.

14:31.800 --> 14:33.800
Can we get up now?

14:33.800 --> 14:36.140
Yeah, sure.

14:40.040 --> 14:41.770
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

15:05.270 --> 15:06.300
Oh!

15:07.140 --> 15:08.930
( crowd yelling indistinctly )

15:18.980 --> 15:20.150
Did you see
where it came from?

15:29.720 --> 15:30.990
WALKER:
There he is.

15:34.560 --> 15:35.630
( tires screech )

15:50.110 --> 15:53.080
(<i> tranquil flute theme playing</i> )

15:59.820 --> 16:02.290
Something troubling you,
Washoe?

16:07.130 --> 16:10.530
There's a shadow
over the moon tonight.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.630
Can you see it?

16:13.640 --> 16:15.840
WALKER:
No.

16:15.840 --> 16:17.970
Look more closely.

16:17.970 --> 16:20.310
A shadow isn't
always a shadow.

16:20.310 --> 16:24.680
What is obvious is sometimes
hidden in plain view.

16:25.710 --> 16:26.710
Washoe?

16:26.710 --> 16:28.180
Yes, I see it.

16:28.180 --> 16:29.180
Keep lookin'.

16:30.520 --> 16:33.850
It will disappear as quickly
as it has come.

16:38.730 --> 16:39.930
( men laughing )

16:39.930 --> 16:42.330
Hey, this looks like
a good truck to steal.

16:43.400 --> 16:44.860
MAN: Yeah.
MAN 2: Go on, take it.

16:44.870 --> 16:45.870
( grunts )

16:45.870 --> 16:47.270
MAN: He needs the key.
MAN 2: Yeah.

16:48.770 --> 16:50.670
MAN:
Yeah, I'll tell you...

16:52.640 --> 16:55.010
MAN 2:
Yeah, go on, get it! Get it!

16:56.980 --> 16:58.610
MAN 2:
What's the matter?
What is it now?

17:00.120 --> 17:02.580
What, no car alarm?
What arrogance, man.

17:02.580 --> 17:03.780
( men laugh )

17:12.460 --> 17:13.630
( grunts )

17:22.540 --> 17:23.800
MAN:
If we can take a look at this,

17:23.800 --> 17:25.170
I'd like to get
some copies of this.

17:25.170 --> 17:26.510
WOMAN:
Texas Rangers, Company B.

17:26.510 --> 17:27.740
MAN:
Thank you.

17:29.480 --> 17:31.310
( phone rings )

17:31.310 --> 17:33.450
Hey, good-lookin',
what's cookin'?

17:33.450 --> 17:35.650
Hi, Gerard.

17:35.650 --> 17:37.180
You change your hair
or something?

17:37.190 --> 17:39.520
You look...different.

17:41.220 --> 17:44.390
Is there something that I can
help you with this morning?

17:44.390 --> 17:47.290
Oh, yeah, uh, Mac said
I'm supposed to give you this.

17:47.300 --> 17:50.300
Oh, right, the files.
It's okay, I'll just take it.

17:58.310 --> 17:59.770
Isn't that it?

18:00.540 --> 18:01.740
Yeah.

18:01.740 --> 18:04.410
All right.
Well, I'll see you later, then.

18:04.410 --> 18:07.250
Okay, yeah. Um, sure.

18:07.880 --> 18:08.950
You, uh...

18:08.950 --> 18:11.420
You gonna be at C.D.'s
after work?

18:11.420 --> 18:12.550
Mm...

18:12.550 --> 18:15.990
Gee, I don't know.
Um...maybe.

18:15.990 --> 18:17.390
I'll see if--
I'll see if maybe my--

18:17.390 --> 18:19.330
My boyfriend
and I'll stop by.

18:20.860 --> 18:22.730
I'll see you, then.

18:26.730 --> 18:28.300
Since the DMV came up
empty on Texas,

18:28.300 --> 18:30.200
I'm gonna try Louisiana
and Oklahoma, all right?

18:30.200 --> 18:31.200
Good idea.

18:31.210 --> 18:32.600
Evie, is there
any word on the, uh...

18:34.840 --> 18:36.210
On the, uh...

18:38.410 --> 18:39.750
Wow.

18:39.750 --> 18:41.310
Holy mackerel.

18:41.320 --> 18:42.820
Is that--?

18:42.820 --> 18:44.950
Y-you look, uh...

18:44.950 --> 18:45.980
different.

18:48.520 --> 18:50.390
So, what do you think?

18:51.360 --> 18:52.660
You look
absolutely stunning.

18:52.660 --> 18:54.030
Really?

18:54.030 --> 18:56.730
Now-- Now, I-- I can certainly
go home and change at lunch.

18:56.730 --> 18:59.270
No, don't change a thing.

18:59.270 --> 19:00.530
Believe me.

19:01.300 --> 19:02.300
You mean it?

19:02.300 --> 19:03.800
Mm-hm.

19:06.040 --> 19:07.570
What was I gonna
ask you?

19:07.570 --> 19:08.910
Um...

19:08.910 --> 19:10.010
Oh, yeah,

19:10.010 --> 19:11.780
about the applications
for the Rangers.

19:11.780 --> 19:12.910
Any word on those?

19:12.910 --> 19:14.280
Not so far,
but I'm working on it.

19:14.280 --> 19:15.280
Okay.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.280
More flowers?
Yeah.

19:17.290 --> 19:19.520
Tommy sent 'em to me 'cause
he couldn't make it last night.

19:19.520 --> 19:21.320
( giggles ):
Isn't that sweet?

19:21.320 --> 19:24.660
That's 'cause you're
my yellow rose of Texas.

19:24.660 --> 19:26.860
Come here, sugarplum.

19:28.100 --> 19:29.230
Mm!

19:29.230 --> 19:31.530
Uh, Tommy-- Tommy Williams,
this is Ranger--

19:31.530 --> 19:32.530
Walker.

19:32.530 --> 19:34.230
Walker.
My pleasure. My pleasure.

19:34.240 --> 19:36.040
Evie's told me
a lot about you.

19:36.040 --> 19:37.300
Likewise.

19:37.310 --> 19:38.940
Well, we're just going to get
a bite to eat,

19:38.940 --> 19:40.170
if you care to join us.

19:40.180 --> 19:42.210
Uh, no, thanks.
Maybe some other time.

19:42.210 --> 19:43.210
Have a good time.

19:43.210 --> 19:44.440
Yeah.
Thank you.

19:44.450 --> 19:45.650
Well, you
got everything?

19:45.650 --> 19:47.050
Yeah. I'm just gonna
grab my bag.

19:47.050 --> 19:48.450
Okay.

19:51.150 --> 19:53.190
Watch the door,
there.

19:53.190 --> 19:54.420
I'm hungry.

19:55.290 --> 19:56.960
( people laughing )

19:56.960 --> 19:58.560
( indistinct chatter )

20:12.310 --> 20:14.310
Dadgum it.
She ought to be here by now.

20:14.310 --> 20:15.310
Who's that?

20:15.310 --> 20:17.240
His computer date.

20:17.240 --> 20:19.510
Wave of the future.
Will you relax? She'll be here.

20:19.510 --> 20:20.550
Maybe.

20:20.550 --> 20:21.910
Cynic.

20:21.920 --> 20:23.720
Hey...

20:23.720 --> 20:25.380
there's my date.

20:26.520 --> 20:28.290
See you after lunch.

20:30.260 --> 20:31.320
Am I late?
No.

20:40.670 --> 20:43.040
Well, maybe yours
is stuck in traffic, C.D.

20:43.040 --> 20:45.040
Well...

20:46.610 --> 20:48.570
No, no.

20:48.580 --> 20:50.240
That's not it.

20:50.240 --> 20:52.780
You know, I've got
a successful business.

20:52.780 --> 20:55.250
Semi-retired Ranger.

20:55.250 --> 20:58.320
You know,
a little status.

20:58.320 --> 21:00.790
I'll bet you
that I have intimidated

21:00.790 --> 21:02.390
that little ol' gal.

21:02.390 --> 21:03.660
I didn't mean to,
but I have.

21:03.660 --> 21:05.590
Yeah, I reckon.

21:05.590 --> 21:06.990
Damn it, I want you
to quit ridin' me.

21:06.990 --> 21:08.090
Okay, I won't ride you,
C.D.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.900
Ah!

21:09.900 --> 21:11.600
That man must be
brain-dead.

21:11.600 --> 21:14.900
I keep hearing Texas Rangers
are pretty tough.

21:14.900 --> 21:16.100
You heard right.

21:18.140 --> 21:19.140
( people screaming )

21:24.280 --> 21:25.980
C.D., aren't you gonna
help him?

21:25.980 --> 21:27.110
No, there's just three of 'em.

21:27.110 --> 21:28.780
Besides, they need to learn
some manners.

21:30.620 --> 21:31.720
( screams )

21:35.290 --> 21:36.890
( grunts )

21:36.890 --> 21:39.060
Hey, take it easy!
It's a joke. It's a joke.

21:39.060 --> 21:40.060
( coughs )

21:40.060 --> 21:41.530
What do you mean, a joke?

21:41.530 --> 21:42.700
Your buddy.

21:42.700 --> 21:44.200
He said he wanted to have
a little fun.

21:44.200 --> 21:46.330
He said he wanted to see
how good his partner really was.

21:46.330 --> 21:48.270
Partner?
Yeah, he's a Texas Ranger.

21:48.270 --> 21:50.400
He gave us $500
to come in here and roust you.

21:50.410 --> 21:51.740
He said you'd think
it was funny.

21:51.740 --> 21:54.310
What's his partner's name?
Ranger Trivette?

21:54.310 --> 21:56.910
Uh... No, Bodine.
Ranger Bodine.

21:56.910 --> 21:58.840
Look, he-- He said once
you knew about it,

21:58.850 --> 22:01.010
it'd be okay.

22:01.010 --> 22:03.720
Okay,
forget about it.

22:05.220 --> 22:07.590
What the hell
is this all about?

22:07.590 --> 22:08.820
Bodine.

22:08.820 --> 22:09.960
Okay, everybody.

22:09.960 --> 22:11.820
Excitement's over.
Drinks on the house.

22:11.830 --> 22:13.160
MAN:
Yeah!

22:14.230 --> 22:16.530
Well, here comes
my date.

22:16.530 --> 22:18.200
How do you know?

22:18.200 --> 22:21.100
She's got on
a red dress. Yes, sir.

22:22.100 --> 22:23.840
Are you the man
they call C.D.?

22:23.840 --> 22:26.200
Yes, I am.

22:26.210 --> 22:28.410
I thought we'd start out
rather slowly

22:28.410 --> 22:31.780
so we could have a real quality,
meaningful relationship, and--

22:31.780 --> 22:34.980
I-- I think maybe we got
our signals crossed.

22:34.980 --> 22:37.050
I'm just here
to deliver this note.

22:37.050 --> 22:38.350
It's for a Ranger Walker.

22:38.350 --> 22:40.320
Oh, right here.

22:40.320 --> 22:42.250
If it's any
consolation, though,

22:42.260 --> 22:43.860
I think you're
real cute.

22:43.860 --> 22:45.290
Have a drink
on the house, huh.

22:45.290 --> 22:46.530
Thanks.

22:49.030 --> 22:52.560
"I wanted to see if you were
as tough as your reputation.

22:52.570 --> 22:57.070
"You look pretty good,
but not good as me.

22:57.070 --> 23:00.110
Ranger Bodine."

23:00.110 --> 23:02.340
Where did you
get this?

23:02.340 --> 23:04.910
Some guy handed it to me
on my way in.

23:09.020 --> 23:11.120
Excuse me, young lady.
What'd this guy look like?

23:11.120 --> 23:12.750
He's a tall,
good-looking guy.

23:12.750 --> 23:14.520
He had on, uh,
blue jeans...

23:16.060 --> 23:17.660
The only Ranger I ever knew
named Bodine,

23:17.660 --> 23:19.890
his first name
was Phil.

23:19.890 --> 23:22.690
And hell, he's been dead
20 years.

23:22.700 --> 23:25.430
You fellows ask me, you're--
You're barking up the wrong tree

23:25.430 --> 23:27.870
if you're looking for a Ranger
or anybody else named Bodine.

23:27.870 --> 23:32.170
That sucker just simply
not gonna give you that much.

23:32.170 --> 23:34.140
You have to get
in his boots.

23:34.140 --> 23:37.010
You're gonna have to think
like he thinks

23:37.010 --> 23:38.310
if you're gonna
find him.

23:38.310 --> 23:40.350
How did he know about Billy Joe
and Petey Cevera?

23:40.350 --> 23:42.350
Inside information.

23:42.350 --> 23:44.520
Who knew about us going to pick
up Petey Cevera last night?

23:44.520 --> 23:49.620
Us, Evie, the judge,
Mabel Shoops.

23:49.620 --> 23:52.690
I guess we can safely
eliminate the judge.

23:52.690 --> 23:53.990
Let's go see Mabel.

24:04.440 --> 24:05.970
Hi, Mabel.

24:05.970 --> 24:07.910
What does
the sign say, Walker?

24:07.910 --> 24:10.280
We only need a couple minutes
of your time.

24:10.280 --> 24:12.580
Well, maybe I haven't got
a couple of minutes.

24:12.580 --> 24:14.150
Who knows at my age?

24:14.150 --> 24:15.820
Besides,
I'm on my break.

24:15.820 --> 24:17.420
Look like you're workin'
to me.

24:17.420 --> 24:21.250
Just makin' out
my last will and testament.

24:21.260 --> 24:23.060
But don't worry.

24:23.060 --> 24:24.690
I'm not leaving you
anything.

24:24.690 --> 24:26.130
TRIVETTE:
I love it.

24:26.130 --> 24:28.330
There's actually a woman
in Texas who doesn't go gaga

24:28.330 --> 24:29.730
every time
she sees you.

24:29.730 --> 24:31.260
Wrong, cowboy.

24:31.270 --> 24:33.070
Broke my heart's
what he done.

24:33.070 --> 24:34.400
What?

24:34.400 --> 24:36.340
All I wanted to do was
take him to lunch.

24:36.340 --> 24:38.540
( laughing ):
Yeah, in Acapulco.

24:38.540 --> 24:43.280
Well, can't blame an ol' gal
for tryin', now, can ya?

24:43.280 --> 24:45.340
Ah, what the hey.

24:45.350 --> 24:46.750
What's up?

24:46.750 --> 24:49.750
You issued a warrant yesterday
on a Petey Cevera?

24:49.750 --> 24:50.850
Indeed, I did.

24:50.850 --> 24:52.220
I hope you showed him
what for too--

24:52.220 --> 24:54.090
I remember that case.
It was all over the papers.

24:54.090 --> 24:56.620
Did anyone else
know about the warrant?

24:56.620 --> 24:59.020
Oh, just that new Ranger.

24:59.030 --> 25:02.190
He was real excited
when I gave him the word.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.300
What's his name?

25:04.300 --> 25:06.300
Well, come to think of it,
he didn't tell me his name.

25:06.300 --> 25:07.800
He's awful cute, though.

25:07.800 --> 25:09.100
You better watch out,
Walker.

25:09.100 --> 25:11.070
This one gonna give you
a run for your money.

25:11.070 --> 25:12.170
Bodine?

25:15.140 --> 25:16.710
Did he know about
Billy Joe McArthur?

25:16.710 --> 25:19.110
Oh, yeah, sure.
I told him about that.

25:19.110 --> 25:20.710
When's the first time
he came in, Mabel?

25:20.720 --> 25:22.680
Couple of weeks ago.

25:22.680 --> 25:23.780
Gave me a list
of the people

25:23.780 --> 25:25.920
that y'all
are on the lookout for.

25:25.920 --> 25:28.350
Then he asked me to give him
advanced warning

25:28.360 --> 25:30.260
when the warrants
were gonna be issued.

25:30.260 --> 25:31.460
Said he'd check with me.

25:31.460 --> 25:33.020
Well, he's just called me
on the phone,

25:33.030 --> 25:34.560
and he's just come
in that one time.

25:34.560 --> 25:36.060
When was the last
time he came in?

25:36.060 --> 25:38.400
Well, just a couple minutes ago.
You just missed him.

25:38.400 --> 25:39.400
What did he look like?

25:39.400 --> 25:40.730
Oh, big handsome guy.

25:40.730 --> 25:43.100
He had on a silver belly hat
and a red shirt.

25:43.100 --> 25:44.100
And, uh--

25:44.110 --> 25:45.340
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

25:45.340 --> 25:47.040
Hey.

25:52.710 --> 25:54.450
Down the stairs.

25:55.550 --> 25:56.920
Look out!

25:56.920 --> 25:58.280
WOMAN:
Oh!

26:25.380 --> 26:26.380
Hey--?

26:26.380 --> 26:27.980
Uh, hey, what did I do?

26:27.980 --> 26:30.050
Let's go find out.

26:35.060 --> 26:36.890
( chattering )

26:42.130 --> 26:45.760
WOMAN:
Thank you very much.
I hope it's successful.

26:46.700 --> 26:48.600
This the guy, Mabel?
( scoffs )

26:48.600 --> 26:49.870
This ain't him.

26:49.870 --> 26:51.970
I told you
the guy was handsome.

26:51.970 --> 26:54.110
Oh. No offense.

26:54.810 --> 26:56.140
I'm sorry about that.

26:56.140 --> 26:58.740
Yeah. You fit a description
of a suspect.

26:58.750 --> 27:02.720
But the other guy
was real handsome, huh?

27:02.720 --> 27:04.320
Yeah.

27:06.320 --> 27:08.750
( phone rings )

27:08.760 --> 27:10.220
County clerk.

27:10.220 --> 27:12.020
Yea-- Sure.
Sure, he's right here.

27:12.030 --> 27:13.030
It's for you.

27:13.030 --> 27:14.430
It's Ranger Bodine.

27:14.430 --> 27:16.960
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

27:19.500 --> 27:20.500
Yeah.

27:20.500 --> 27:21.930
Close, Walker,

27:21.940 --> 27:23.900
but no kewpie doll.

27:23.900 --> 27:26.570
(<i> click, dial tone</i> )

27:29.010 --> 27:30.410
What'd he say?

27:36.720 --> 27:40.690
(<i> mellow theme playing</i> )

27:45.730 --> 27:46.890
Evie.
Evie.

27:46.890 --> 27:48.730
WALKER:
Anything yet on Bodine?

27:48.730 --> 27:49.730
Not so far.

27:49.730 --> 27:52.360
( sighs )

27:52.370 --> 27:54.100
I was here till 10:00
last night,

27:54.100 --> 27:56.500
and I've been
working on it all day.

27:56.500 --> 27:58.540
But I got access to the reject
files from the academy.

27:58.540 --> 28:00.270
These are from
the last couple years.

28:03.510 --> 28:04.510
Nothing?

28:08.150 --> 28:09.650
Okay.

28:09.650 --> 28:10.680
Why don't you check

28:10.680 --> 28:13.190
on anyone
who has been arrested

28:13.190 --> 28:14.650
for impersonating
a police officer.

28:14.660 --> 28:17.460
See if there's
anything there.

28:17.460 --> 28:19.760
Evie, more flowers.
( chuckles )

28:19.760 --> 28:22.230
He sends them to me
every day.

28:22.230 --> 28:24.260
When did you
meet Tommy?

28:24.270 --> 28:25.560
Um...

28:25.570 --> 28:27.070
A couple weeks ago.

28:27.070 --> 28:28.530
Where at?

28:28.540 --> 28:30.400
Right here
in the office.

28:30.400 --> 28:33.040
What was he
doing here?

28:34.940 --> 28:36.880
I don't know.

28:36.880 --> 28:38.880
He just kind of showed up
at my desk,

28:38.880 --> 28:40.310
and he was real handsome

28:40.310 --> 28:42.850
and attractive
and everything, and...

28:43.980 --> 28:45.320
And, uh,
I was having some trouble

28:45.320 --> 28:46.790
with the hard drive
on my computer,

28:46.790 --> 28:49.390
and he offered
to fix it for me, and--

28:49.390 --> 28:50.390
Why?

28:51.120 --> 28:52.120
Just...

28:52.130 --> 28:53.760
care about you.
Yeah.

28:55.330 --> 28:58.300
So...

28:58.300 --> 29:01.670
How does
"Evie Williams" sound?

29:02.700 --> 29:03.770
Whoa, ha-ha-ha.

29:03.770 --> 29:04.770
Uh...

29:04.770 --> 29:07.610
yeah, right.

29:07.610 --> 29:10.280
Not gonna touch that.

29:10.280 --> 29:13.380
Check out
this Tommy Williams.

29:13.380 --> 29:15.310
( grunting )

29:16.320 --> 29:18.950
MAN:
Oh, yeah, a few more sets.

29:24.060 --> 29:26.190
( punching )

29:48.920 --> 29:51.480
( grunts )

30:03.600 --> 30:05.200
( rings )

30:05.200 --> 30:06.730
( beeps )

30:06.730 --> 30:08.330
COMPUTER VOICE:
We're sorry.

30:08.340 --> 30:09.330
<i> You have reached a number</i>

30:09.340 --> 30:10.370
<i> that has been disconnected</i>

30:10.370 --> 30:11.800

30:11.810 --> 30:13.610
<i> If you feel you have reached--</i>

30:16.910 --> 30:18.610
( sighs )

30:21.980 --> 30:23.180
Anything?

30:23.180 --> 30:25.120
Zip.

30:25.120 --> 30:28.790
Well, Mabel issued a warrant
on a Travis Sinclair.

30:28.790 --> 30:30.660
Never heard of him.
( chuckles )

30:30.660 --> 30:32.820
A real nice guy.

30:32.830 --> 30:35.330
I'm looking forward
to this one.

30:35.330 --> 30:37.160
Why don't you keep working
on that thing there,

30:37.160 --> 30:39.830
and I'll go get him.
All right.

30:44.400 --> 30:47.040
( siren bleeps )

30:58.990 --> 31:00.290
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

31:06.630 --> 31:08.090
Travis Sinclair,

31:08.100 --> 31:10.530
I got a warrant
for your arrest.

31:16.340 --> 31:18.200
Ease on
back down there.

31:18.210 --> 31:19.200
That's it.

31:20.970 --> 31:23.010
Always thought
Walker would come for me.

31:23.010 --> 31:25.110
After all this time
bustin' my chops,

31:25.110 --> 31:27.610
don't tell me he's got
something better to do.

31:27.610 --> 31:29.480
No, the, uh, department
just thought

31:29.480 --> 31:30.980
you were too much
for Walker.

31:30.990 --> 31:32.850
( laughs )

31:32.850 --> 31:35.690
Ah... I thought
he was their glory boy.

31:35.690 --> 31:38.120
So if I'm supposed to be
too much for Walker,

31:38.130 --> 31:41.090
what can you do
that he can't?

31:42.100 --> 31:43.830
Well, I'll have
to show you.

31:43.830 --> 31:45.030
( chuckles )

31:45.030 --> 31:47.170
Good morning, Mrs. Williams.
<i> Yes.</i>

31:47.170 --> 31:49.470
This is
Ranger James Trivette.

31:49.470 --> 31:51.240
I need to know if you
have a member of your club

31:51.240 --> 31:54.240
with the name Samuel,
Sam or S. Bodine.

31:54.240 --> 31:56.210
<i> Bodine...</i>

31:56.210 --> 31:58.880
<i> No, I don't show anything.</i>

31:58.880 --> 32:01.110
Okay, thank you very much.
<i> You're welcome.</i>

32:04.780 --> 32:06.390
( sighs )

32:06.390 --> 32:08.950
Who the hell are you,
Bodine?

32:08.960 --> 32:11.860
Excuse me?

32:11.860 --> 32:15.760
Oh, yes, ma'am,
Texas Ranger.

32:15.760 --> 32:18.660
Well, you just let me know
where those bad guys are.

32:20.670 --> 32:23.070
Right there. Now, you
just freeze right there.

32:23.070 --> 32:25.100
Don't you move.

32:25.710 --> 32:27.410
Yeah?

32:27.410 --> 32:31.210
Well, if Walker
can't do it, Bodine can.

32:31.210 --> 32:34.250
(<i> pensive theme playing</i> )

32:41.020 --> 32:42.290
Well, hi.
Hi.

32:42.290 --> 32:43.290
( both chuckling )

32:43.290 --> 32:44.490
This is not
a bad time, is it?

32:44.490 --> 32:46.060
No. This is a little bit
of a surprise.

32:46.060 --> 32:47.460
I wasn't expecting
to see you.

32:47.460 --> 32:50.460
Mm. I just couldn't wait
to see my honey.
Oh.

32:50.460 --> 32:51.730
You sure it's okay?
Well, sure.

32:51.730 --> 32:53.200
Well, where we going?

32:53.200 --> 32:55.370
Well, you're in
for the surprise of your life.

32:55.370 --> 32:56.940
Oh, I love surprises.

32:56.940 --> 32:58.140
( chuckles )

32:58.710 --> 33:00.040
Come on, heh.

33:00.040 --> 33:02.410
Come on there. I can
hardly wait to get there.

33:02.410 --> 33:04.340
Got everything?
All right.

33:06.510 --> 33:08.380
MAN:
We'll have closure on this case.

33:08.380 --> 33:10.180
WOMAN:
Mm-hm.

33:10.180 --> 33:12.150
Ranger's station.

33:12.150 --> 33:13.950
Come on.
Yes, he is.

33:13.950 --> 33:14.950
May I ask who's
calling?

33:17.360 --> 33:18.590
TRIVETTE:
Come on.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.160
MAN:
No, I did not.

33:23.160 --> 33:25.260
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

33:26.330 --> 33:27.330
MAN:
Yeah, I will.

33:29.600 --> 33:31.540
Evie!

33:31.540 --> 33:33.400
What is it?
It's Williams. Williams.

33:33.410 --> 33:34.710
Evie's boyfriend
is Bodine.

33:34.710 --> 33:36.610
I just saw them outside.

33:39.150 --> 33:43.050
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

33:51.060 --> 33:52.090
Let's go.

33:56.760 --> 33:58.860
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

34:35.540 --> 34:37.699
This guy's really obsessed
with you, man.

34:40.139 --> 34:42.409
( ringing )

34:52.090 --> 34:53.650
Howdy, Walker.

34:53.650 --> 34:55.320
Hey, Bodine.

34:55.320 --> 34:57.720
That's correct,
my friend.

34:57.720 --> 34:59.320
You know,
I just wanted to say,

34:59.330 --> 35:01.930
speaking to you like this
is a real pleasure.

35:01.930 --> 35:05.200
My little heart's just going,
"A-pitty-pat, pitty-pat."

35:05.200 --> 35:08.530
I got somebody I want you
to give a big hello to.

35:08.540 --> 35:11.600
( sobbing ):
W-Walker, I'm--

35:11.610 --> 35:12.870
Please help me.

35:12.870 --> 35:15.370
I-- I-- I-- I--
I didn't know.

35:15.380 --> 35:16.570
<i> I didn't know.</i>
<i> He's crazy.</i>

35:16.580 --> 35:18.310
You gotta help me.

35:18.310 --> 35:19.480
Please!

35:20.880 --> 35:21.910
Let her go, Bodine.

35:21.920 --> 35:23.450
She's hasn't done
anything to you.

35:23.450 --> 35:24.950
Well, maybe I will,
maybe I won't.

35:24.950 --> 35:27.080
You know these women.
They like to run their mouth.

35:27.090 --> 35:30.120
Right now, Walker,
I want you to meet me

35:30.120 --> 35:32.990
at the old factory
on Main Street at midnight.

35:32.990 --> 35:36.360
That's 3922 Main Street.

35:36.360 --> 35:38.230
And one more thing,
good buddy:

35:38.230 --> 35:39.930
you better be alone.

35:39.930 --> 35:42.230
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

35:44.270 --> 35:45.970
He wants me
to meet him alone.

35:45.970 --> 35:48.340
That's an obvious trap.
You can't go there alone.

35:48.340 --> 35:51.680
He's got Evie.
What choice do I have?

35:51.680 --> 35:54.380
Hey...partner.

35:54.850 --> 35:56.180
Walker.

36:17.300 --> 36:19.440
( door opens, footsteps )

36:24.180 --> 36:25.910
Trivette told me
what you're planning to do.

36:25.910 --> 36:28.850
You cannot
go after him alone.

36:28.850 --> 36:30.680
I have no choice.

36:30.680 --> 36:33.220
What is it with you
macho Texas Rangers?

36:33.220 --> 36:34.490
Why do you have to turn
everything

36:34.490 --> 36:36.050
into a life-or-death
struggle?

36:36.060 --> 36:37.620
Bodine started it,
not me.

36:37.620 --> 36:39.120
So what?

36:39.130 --> 36:41.760
It doesn't mean you have
to finish it on his terms.

36:41.760 --> 36:44.260
Bodine is obsessed with proving
that he's better than you,

36:44.260 --> 36:46.330
and is not gonna play
by the rules.

36:46.330 --> 36:49.030
He wants to prove man-to-man
that he's better than me.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.600
And that's
his big mistake.

36:50.600 --> 36:54.170
How do you know that
for sure?

36:54.170 --> 36:55.640
You're gonna get yourself killed

36:55.640 --> 36:58.480
because of your stupid,
foolish pride.

36:58.480 --> 36:59.510
If I backed down
every time

36:59.510 --> 37:01.610
a guy like Bodine
entered my life,

37:01.620 --> 37:04.380
how would I
live with myself?

37:04.380 --> 37:06.080
Look...

37:06.090 --> 37:08.250
You've got
to understand.

37:08.250 --> 37:10.620
Every time
I put on this badge,

37:10.620 --> 37:12.760
I've got to believe
I'm making a difference.

37:13.830 --> 37:15.330
Who I am,

37:15.330 --> 37:17.500
what I am,

37:17.500 --> 37:18.500
a Ranger,

37:18.500 --> 37:19.830
is part of me.

37:21.030 --> 37:23.030
The best part of me.

37:23.040 --> 37:24.970
Look...
(<i> sentimental theme playing</i> )

37:24.970 --> 37:28.470
The only part
that makes...sense to me.

37:28.480 --> 37:29.470
Can you understand that?

37:30.210 --> 37:33.080
Yes, I know.

37:33.080 --> 37:34.350
But I just wish that--

37:34.350 --> 37:35.980
Shh.

37:40.020 --> 37:42.490
I wish...

37:42.490 --> 37:44.420
( sighs )

37:44.420 --> 37:46.820
I wish I--

37:46.830 --> 37:49.530
I knew how
to express myself better,

37:49.530 --> 37:53.500
to tell you how much...
you mean to me,

37:53.500 --> 37:55.800
how special...

37:55.800 --> 37:57.770
you are to me,

37:57.770 --> 38:02.040
probably more
than you'll ever know.

38:05.250 --> 38:06.240
Washoe.

38:07.980 --> 38:09.710
It's time.

38:25.730 --> 38:27.730
Don't you
worry yourself none, Alex.

38:27.730 --> 38:30.970

38:32.540 --> 38:35.040
I couldn't bear
to lose him.

38:35.040 --> 38:37.140

I'm up here, Walker.

39:35.800 --> 39:38.940
Now, honey pie, I bet you're
just glad to see him.

39:38.940 --> 39:41.940
I know he's glad
to see you.

39:41.940 --> 39:43.470
Come on.

40:01.660 --> 40:03.330
Drop your weapon.

40:08.540 --> 40:10.030
Now, kick it
over there.

40:13.240 --> 40:15.870
( laughing )

40:15.880 --> 40:17.510
As you could see,
I'm still doing

40:17.510 --> 40:19.010
your job for you.

40:19.010 --> 40:21.910
Case closed
on Travis Sinclair.

40:21.920 --> 40:24.920
You're not doing my job
for me, Bodine.

40:24.920 --> 40:27.290
I let the court
decide their fate.

40:27.290 --> 40:29.420
Now, that right there
is the root of your problem.

40:29.420 --> 40:30.920
You're too soft.

40:30.920 --> 40:33.890
You built your whole
reputation up on a myth.

40:33.890 --> 40:35.190
That's why I'm here.

40:35.190 --> 40:38.200

you're nothing but a fraud.

I could've been

40:42.700 --> 40:44.500
They told me I had
aggressive tendencies.

40:44.500 --> 40:45.500
Imagine that.

40:46.540 --> 40:47.540
What the hell

40:47.540 --> 40:48.910
do they expect
with all the garbage

40:48.910 --> 40:50.340
walking the streets
out there?

40:50.340 --> 40:52.180
I told them,
give me a chance.

40:52.180 --> 40:55.550
Just give me a chance
to prove to them what I can do.

40:55.550 --> 40:56.550
And they wouldn't.

40:58.250 --> 41:00.490
No, sirree.

41:00.490 --> 41:03.150
They sure wouldn't.

41:03.160 --> 41:06.360
And now I'm going
to have to prove it to you.
