00:10.541 --> 00:12.166
H.P. Lovecraft,

00:12.250 --> 00:14.416
the author of today's tale,

00:14.500 --> 00:16.208
feared the universe.

00:16.291 --> 00:20.333
He believed it to be
a haunted house of cosmic proportions,

00:20.416 --> 00:23.708
one in which danger lurks
behind every door…

00:26.083 --> 00:29.708
…revealing new realities,
dreams, nightmares.

00:30.958 --> 00:32.791
Especially for those of us

00:33.375 --> 00:34.583
who find the key.

00:35.583 --> 00:38.916
Our story tonight is
"Dreams in the Witch House,"

00:39.000 --> 00:41.708
and its director is Catherine Hardwick.

01:52.750 --> 01:56.041
<i>This is a fable about love and life.</i>

01:56.125 --> 01:57.875
<i>The story of two fellas,</i>

01:57.958 --> 01:59.250
<i>myself</i>

01:59.333 --> 02:00.500
<i>and myself.</i>

02:01.083 --> 02:04.500
<i>But don't you worry,</i>
<i>I'll help you figure it out,</i>

02:04.583 --> 02:07.416
<i>and I promise ya a happy ending.</i>

02:50.666 --> 02:51.666
Walt.

02:53.625 --> 02:54.458
What's wrong?

02:58.375 --> 03:01.125
-Epperley, what's the matter?

03:01.208 --> 03:02.166
It's…

03:02.958 --> 03:03.875
It's coming.

03:04.500 --> 03:06.500
What do you mean? Who's coming?

03:06.583 --> 03:07.458
The ghosts.

03:07.541 --> 03:09.208
I don't wanna go with them.

03:09.708 --> 03:11.750
I don't wanna go.

03:12.333 --> 03:15.166
Listen to me, okay,
you're not goin' anywhere.

03:15.250 --> 03:16.541
I won't let you.

03:18.458 --> 03:20.000
I'm scared, Walt.

03:20.708 --> 03:21.541
Look at me.

03:22.291 --> 03:24.541
I promised you I'd protect you.

03:25.125 --> 03:26.458
You remember that, don't you?

03:29.125 --> 03:31.541
Epperley, do you remember?

03:34.541 --> 03:35.500
Epperley?

03:36.500 --> 03:37.583
Hey.

03:37.666 --> 03:38.500
Epperley?

03:39.416 --> 03:40.333
Epperley?

03:46.791 --> 03:48.750
Oh, Epperley. I promised!

04:18.250 --> 04:19.333
How?

04:20.375 --> 04:21.583
Where am I?

04:22.916 --> 04:23.916
What's happening?

04:27.958 --> 04:30.125
That's… That's…

04:30.833 --> 04:31.708
Walt?

04:32.625 --> 04:33.625
Am I…

04:35.833 --> 04:36.791
A ghost!

04:40.750 --> 04:41.666
Do you hear that?

04:41.750 --> 04:43.333
-No.

04:47.125 --> 04:48.625
-Ah!

04:49.375 --> 04:50.958
Walt, help me!

04:51.041 --> 04:52.375
Help me!

04:54.250 --> 04:56.041
Please, help me!

04:57.583 --> 04:58.750
Please!

04:58.833 --> 04:59.791
Epperley!

05:11.666 --> 05:14.541
<i>Good evening, people of Boston.</i>

05:15.041 --> 05:20.000
We welcome your interest
in other dimensions.

05:20.583 --> 05:23.583
The bridge between worlds.

05:24.875 --> 05:26.375
What is it?

05:27.208 --> 05:29.375
Where is it?

05:29.458 --> 05:34.208
And who has the power to break it down?

05:36.833 --> 05:42.375
She was born
with the ability to cross that bridge.

05:42.458 --> 05:47.333
She has seen the other side,
and she brings voices back.

05:49.875 --> 05:51.125
Dear friends,

05:52.458 --> 05:54.291
you are looking at her.

05:55.291 --> 05:56.916
Madame Levine!

06:06.291 --> 06:12.208
Watch as she reaches out
to this couple's poor lost son.

06:16.333 --> 06:18.125
Beloved boy,

06:18.916 --> 06:22.291
thou who perished in fever,

06:22.375 --> 06:24.625
I conjure thee.

06:30.708 --> 06:32.041
He's here.

06:38.583 --> 06:41.375
Remain calm! You will not be harmed!

06:41.458 --> 06:45.416
Sh! Sh! Sh!

06:56.666 --> 06:57.791
Is it…

06:57.875 --> 06:59.875
Ectoplasm.

07:00.375 --> 07:02.875
-Madame Levine, are you all right?

07:02.958 --> 07:04.791
Madame Levine, can you hear us?

07:04.875 --> 07:06.333
Is she…

07:06.416 --> 07:07.791
Dear friends,

07:08.541 --> 07:11.208
remember what you have seen here tonight.

07:12.416 --> 07:15.625
The bridge is real.

07:18.833 --> 07:21.708
Souvenirs and programs
are available in the lobby.

07:21.791 --> 07:23.625
The bridge
can take me to my sister.

07:23.708 --> 07:25.541
We have to get back there.

07:25.625 --> 07:26.458
No.

07:27.833 --> 07:29.625
Walter. Walter!

07:30.708 --> 07:31.958
Walter! Walter!

07:42.625 --> 07:43.708
So sorry.

07:45.500 --> 07:46.375
Walter!

07:52.125 --> 07:55.583
Goddamn turban is squeezing my brains out.

07:56.291 --> 07:59.541
Well, we can't afford a new one.
We're not even gonna break even.

07:59.625 --> 08:01.750
Did you see all the empty seats out there?

08:01.833 --> 08:04.541
I can't do any more than I am.

08:04.625 --> 08:06.458
That last part wasn't acting.

08:07.416 --> 08:09.791
Thought I was gon' be sick onstage.

08:09.875 --> 08:12.250
It must be the egg whites.
We'll omit 'em next time.

08:12.833 --> 08:14.875
It's not the egg whites!

08:14.958 --> 08:20.375
It's regurgitating tissue
soaked in a Plasticine posset.

08:20.875 --> 08:23.375
You should try puttin'
this dirty ol' thing

08:23.458 --> 08:25.208
in your mouth sometime.

08:28.916 --> 08:30.750
Ectoplasm!

08:36.000 --> 08:39.833
I'm sorry, Walter. I know
that you thought this might be the one.

08:39.916 --> 08:43.166
I know the other side is real.
I've seen it.

08:44.458 --> 08:46.916
But how am I ever
supposed to prove that to the masses?

08:49.250 --> 08:50.916
Listen, um,

08:51.958 --> 08:54.750
a family friend works for <i>Time </i>magazine.

08:55.625 --> 08:58.791
My ma had him round
for dinner the other night, and he just…

08:59.666 --> 09:02.708
he asked me if I'd be interested in a job.

09:05.125 --> 09:06.750
It's… It's nothing fancy.

09:06.833 --> 09:09.250
Just… Just filing and typing, but…

09:11.750 --> 09:15.041
I just can't keep juggling
odd jobs to scrape a living.

09:16.291 --> 09:19.000
The Spiritualist Society
barely pays anymore.

09:20.458 --> 09:24.041
Maybe… Maybe it's time that we consider
what else we can do with our lives.

09:24.583 --> 09:27.250
There's nothing else I wanna do.

09:27.916 --> 09:29.875
I thought you believed in the cause.

09:30.375 --> 09:31.333
I do.

09:32.125 --> 09:34.125
I just don't wanna be a pauper forever.

09:34.208 --> 09:36.500
Right, so money trumps honor?

09:36.583 --> 09:37.916
-That's not fair.
-Mm.

11:40.291 --> 11:42.458
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

11:42.541 --> 11:43.833
Blessed art thou amongst women,

11:43.916 --> 11:45.958
and blessed is
the fruit of thy womb, our Lord Jesus.

11:46.041 --> 11:49.166
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners, now…

11:50.958 --> 11:53.166
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

11:53.250 --> 11:56.375
Blessed art thou amongst women,
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb…

11:56.458 --> 11:58.166
It was built on a ley line.

11:58.666 --> 12:00.916
The house has undeniable powers.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.708
I'll see what we can do.

12:02.791 --> 12:06.500
Maybe we will investigate.
I cannot guarantee anything.

12:06.583 --> 12:08.791
At least keep the painting.
Display it.

12:08.875 --> 12:11.625
In time it will guide its way back to me.

12:11.708 --> 12:14.958
-It is important.
-All right, I will. I pr… I promise.

12:17.833 --> 12:20.250
If anyone
would understand my visions, he would.

12:20.333 --> 12:23.750
Your visions are from the Devil.
Don't ever contact me again!

12:29.708 --> 12:30.625
Mr. Gilman.

12:31.375 --> 12:32.750
What was that all about?

12:33.333 --> 12:34.333
A painter.

12:34.416 --> 12:38.291
She rents a room
in Keziah Mason's old house.

12:38.375 --> 12:39.875
-The witch?
-Yes.

12:39.958 --> 12:41.791
She makes all kinds o' claims about it.

12:41.875 --> 12:44.041
Portals, changing dimensions.

12:44.541 --> 12:46.958
But I fear that woman
is not in her right mind.

12:47.041 --> 12:50.666
We need to deal with more reliable people,
don't you agree, Mr. Gilman?

12:50.791 --> 12:52.083
Without a doubt, sir,

12:52.166 --> 12:54.791
but I have two very credible mediums.

12:55.458 --> 12:56.666
Both out of state.

12:57.750 --> 13:00.208
It's just two trips, Mr. Labuschagne.

13:00.291 --> 13:04.166
An Edward Brace in New York
and an Ellen Blackman in Baltimore.

13:04.250 --> 13:05.083
Sniff.

13:06.833 --> 13:07.666
No.

13:08.416 --> 13:12.708
Apparently over 50 people can attest
to Blackman's powers of levitation.

13:12.791 --> 13:15.750
I… told you, Gilman, we can't afford it.

13:15.833 --> 13:21.000
Sir Callahan didn't feel we'd provided
the results to merit further funding.

13:21.083 --> 13:24.041
But sir, we're so close
to finding a real medium.

13:24.500 --> 13:27.416
It's just tough to vet the hoaxes.

13:27.500 --> 13:28.875
Well, be that as it may,

13:28.958 --> 13:32.750
our investors can't keep paying us
to, you know, hit dead ends.

13:34.625 --> 13:38.333
Listen, we may have to face
the very real possibility

13:38.416 --> 13:42.250
that the Spiritualist Society
will close the Massachusetts office.

13:43.250 --> 13:44.250
In the meantime,

13:45.000 --> 13:47.541
we're putting a hold
on all paid fieldwork.

13:49.791 --> 13:51.750
I'm sorry, Gilman.

13:52.583 --> 13:57.000
But, uh, you've still got
your second job, haven't you?

13:58.791 --> 13:59.958
Here's your bourbon.

14:00.041 --> 14:02.250
-Thanks. Keep the change.
-Thank you.

14:11.208 --> 14:12.458
Excuse me.

14:26.333 --> 14:27.333
You got the job.

14:27.416 --> 14:28.416
Ha!

14:28.500 --> 14:31.750
I had no idea
how much hullabaloo is going on in Europe.

14:32.750 --> 14:36.125
D'you… D'you know
that there's a vegetarian superman

14:36.208 --> 14:37.916
rising to power in Germany?

14:38.000 --> 14:40.833
-It's madness!
-Congratulations, Frank.

14:42.416 --> 14:44.958
-They said they need someone else.
-Not interested.

14:45.958 --> 14:47.541
For God's sake, Walter.

14:49.333 --> 14:51.166
Can't you just get off your high horse?

14:51.250 --> 14:53.750
We can keep reading
and researching in our spare time.

14:53.833 --> 14:57.083
-Just with proper roofs over our heads.
-Buy a drink or get out.

15:09.208 --> 15:10.041
You know, you…

15:10.541 --> 15:13.125
you care more
about your dead sister than the living.

15:23.458 --> 15:25.916
-He has the money.
-<i>Yiyíistś áá.</i>

15:26.416 --> 15:29.166
He's a fool if he thinks
he can affect another dimension.

15:29.791 --> 15:32.291
We visit the forest,
but we don't leave ripples.

15:32.916 --> 15:34.666
What do you mean, "another dimension"?

15:36.791 --> 15:38.333
I've seen a forest.

15:39.083 --> 15:41.041
A forest that takes the dead inside.

15:44.708 --> 15:45.750
-Hey.
-Mm.

15:49.541 --> 15:50.750
It's real, isn't it?

15:51.500 --> 15:53.666
Not here. Outside.

16:05.208 --> 16:07.125
My name is Walter Gilman.

16:07.208 --> 16:10.208
I'm a researcher
for the Spiritualist Society.

16:11.166 --> 16:14.125
Another <i>bilagáana</i>
looking to broadcast tribal insights.

16:14.208 --> 16:15.708
No, not at all. I'm…

16:15.791 --> 16:17.875
I'm looking for my sister.

16:19.041 --> 16:20.583
Uh, we… we were twins.

16:21.250 --> 16:25.500
I was there when she died,
and… I saw her spirit.

16:25.583 --> 16:28.833
She was pulled away from me
into some kind of vortex.

16:29.958 --> 16:32.166
I looked inside,
and… and there were trees.

16:32.250 --> 16:34.750
They call it the forest of lost souls.

16:35.375 --> 16:37.750
A limbo for those
who aren't ready to move on.

16:38.250 --> 16:39.333
You've been there?

16:40.208 --> 16:41.083
I have.

16:41.166 --> 16:42.166
How?

16:44.791 --> 16:45.916
Can you take me?

16:48.625 --> 16:50.208
What can you pay, friend?

17:19.000 --> 17:20.541
You brought him?

17:20.625 --> 17:21.833
He pays.

17:46.291 --> 17:48.250
Extracted from a cactus flower.

17:48.333 --> 17:49.625
<i>Óola ditléé.</i>

17:50.291 --> 17:51.875
It translates as "liquid gold."

17:54.583 --> 17:55.875
Is it dangerous?

17:55.958 --> 17:58.375
How badly do you wanna see
your sister again?

18:01.916 --> 18:05.083
And remember,
don't cause any ripples in the forest.

19:23.541 --> 19:24.791
Agh.

19:33.916 --> 19:35.583
Agh! Ah!

20:16.875 --> 20:18.708
-Epperley!

20:31.625 --> 20:32.458
Epperley!

20:34.416 --> 20:35.250
Walt.

20:42.625 --> 20:43.916
Walt!

20:50.708 --> 20:51.708
Ugh!

20:52.333 --> 20:54.916
Next time,
lie on the pillows, <i>bilagáana</i>.

21:01.875 --> 21:02.708
Frank!

21:02.791 --> 21:04.333
Sh!

21:04.416 --> 21:05.375
What…

21:06.375 --> 21:07.541
Coming. Coming!

21:08.666 --> 21:09.541
Mm!

21:11.375 --> 21:13.916
-I saw her, Frank.
-Walter, it's gone two in the morning.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.333
I saw Epperley.

21:15.416 --> 21:17.208
What are you talking about?

21:17.291 --> 21:20.791
I met a gentleman in the pub.
He said he could access other worlds.

21:20.875 --> 21:23.416
And it worked, Frank. It fucking worked.

21:23.500 --> 21:25.541
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

21:25.625 --> 21:27.083
He took me to a place.

21:27.666 --> 21:30.250
They sell a substance called Liquid Gold.

21:30.333 --> 21:31.791
No, you mean a drug.

21:31.875 --> 21:33.791
-Have you lost your senses, Walter?
-No.

21:33.875 --> 21:37.458
I found a facilitator
to get you to the other side!

21:37.541 --> 21:38.958
Wait, wait, you're telling me

21:39.041 --> 21:42.791
that you put an unknown chemical
from an unknown gentleman into your body?

21:42.875 --> 21:46.166
-Have you gone mad?
-If you used it, you'd understand.

21:46.916 --> 21:49.708
We need to go back. We need to buy more.

21:49.791 --> 21:52.666
No, no, no, we don't.
We don't need to do any of that.

21:52.750 --> 21:53.666
Give me…

21:53.750 --> 21:56.250
What we need to do
is knock some sense into you.

21:57.041 --> 21:58.375
You aren't hearing me!

21:59.083 --> 22:01.166
I saw my sister.

22:02.166 --> 22:04.416
She was the same age as when she died,

22:04.500 --> 22:05.833
wearing the same clothes.

22:07.333 --> 22:08.541
And she was trapped.

22:12.125 --> 22:14.125
You think I'm making this up?

22:14.208 --> 22:16.333
I think you're desperate, Walter.

22:17.666 --> 22:20.375
I think you'd do anything, <i>anything,</i>

22:20.458 --> 22:23.458
to prove that what you've been
fighting for is real.

22:25.375 --> 22:27.458
You never believed at all, did you?

22:29.250 --> 22:30.750
I've never seen anything.

22:34.125 --> 22:36.416
You say you've seen all of this, but…

22:38.666 --> 22:39.750
but I never have.

22:53.250 --> 22:54.166
<i>Epperley!</i>

22:55.916 --> 22:56.833
Epperley!

23:06.000 --> 23:07.583
What are you doin' here?

23:14.041 --> 23:15.750
The witch house.

23:21.958 --> 23:23.000
Walt?!

23:24.500 --> 23:25.333
Epperley!

23:31.083 --> 23:34.541
-It really is you!
-I knew I'd find you. I knew it!

23:34.625 --> 23:36.625
I never thought
I'd see you again!

23:38.666 --> 23:39.583
You look

23:40.375 --> 23:42.083
exactly the same.

23:44.208 --> 23:45.416
And you're a man.

23:46.208 --> 23:47.125
I'm sorry.

23:48.416 --> 23:51.083
I'm sorry I couldn't save you
when I had the chance.

23:51.583 --> 23:52.583
It was my time.

23:53.583 --> 23:54.833
I realize that now.

23:55.958 --> 23:59.750
If I hadn't been so afraid,
I wouldn't have ended up here.

24:01.416 --> 24:04.125
Did you make it into
the Boston Symphony Orchestra?

24:08.416 --> 24:10.500
I stopped playin' after you died.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.333
I haven't touched the keys in years.

24:14.416 --> 24:16.833
Walt, you were so talented.

24:16.916 --> 24:20.000
I couldn't think of anything else
but seeing you again.

24:21.666 --> 24:23.333
That's all I've ever wanted.

24:24.083 --> 24:25.208
To find you.

24:27.083 --> 24:28.500
No, not yet.

24:29.416 --> 24:30.583
Come back with me.

24:30.666 --> 24:33.333
-I can't. I've tried to leave.
-I'm not leaving you.

24:33.416 --> 24:34.541
Ah!

25:02.833 --> 25:05.250
"Ours is only one of infinite worlds."

25:06.125 --> 25:07.458
"Keziah Mason."

25:14.458 --> 25:18.291
"Mason claimed the ability
to travel to different dimensions."

25:18.958 --> 25:22.333
"She used an ancient ritual dagger
as a key."

25:26.875 --> 25:30.416
"She was tried for witchcraft
and hung from a tree on her own property."

25:31.666 --> 25:34.250
"Her body was retrieved
by an unknown person or persons

25:34.333 --> 25:35.583
on the third night."

25:36.291 --> 25:38.041
"The corpse was never found."

25:41.916 --> 25:43.250
"The Witch House."

25:44.458 --> 25:46.458
"33 Osgood Street,

25:46.541 --> 25:48.833
just 17 miles from Boston."

25:51.666 --> 25:54.125
I have to investigate that house.

26:04.916 --> 26:06.583
<i>You have to believe me.</i>

26:07.250 --> 26:09.875
It's from my sister's nightgown,
I swear it.

26:09.958 --> 26:13.291
No. Do you understand
how your behavior makes us look?

26:15.500 --> 26:16.375
Sir,

26:17.125 --> 26:20.208
if you just tried Liquid Gold--

26:20.291 --> 26:22.000
No, that is enough.

26:24.416 --> 26:28.125
Things are bad here, Gilman.
We're trying to retain our credibility.

26:28.625 --> 26:31.083
And you come here,
in the aftermath of drug use,

26:31.166 --> 26:32.416
begging for funds?

26:35.625 --> 26:38.833
Your membership
in the Spiritualist Society is terminated.

26:39.666 --> 26:40.916
What?

26:42.083 --> 26:42.916
Go on.

26:46.958 --> 26:49.666
Return to us
when you're an honorable man again.

27:52.958 --> 27:55.333
It's a… little overgrown.

27:55.833 --> 27:57.333
Don't trim nothin'.

28:01.625 --> 28:03.583
There's a painter
living here, right?

28:04.083 --> 28:06.416
Just one tenant at the far end.

28:08.666 --> 28:10.333
You won't see her.

28:13.041 --> 28:14.250
Are there rats here?

28:14.916 --> 28:18.041
Rats, bats, who knows?

28:24.416 --> 28:25.250
Looks damp.

28:27.625 --> 28:28.500
It is.

29:03.666 --> 29:04.750
Fuck me.

29:13.833 --> 29:16.000
"The existence
of other dimensions…"

29:16.500 --> 29:18.041
"…is indisputable."

29:19.541 --> 29:23.375
"Our visitation of such lies solely
in states of altered consciousness."

29:23.458 --> 29:26.083
<i>Altered consciousness.</i>

29:29.875 --> 29:33.666
"The next breakthrough
is the transport of matter."

29:35.291 --> 29:36.375
"There is a key."

29:36.458 --> 29:37.458
<i>A key…</i>

29:39.083 --> 29:45.041
<i>that will allow us to bring something</i>
<i>back from the next world to ours.</i>

30:33.958 --> 30:35.125
Oh.

31:03.125 --> 31:03.958
The key.

31:05.750 --> 31:08.375
Epperley, is this it?

31:53.083 --> 31:53.958
Ah!

33:33.208 --> 33:35.250
Smells like poverty, this one.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.625
Twins.

33:47.416 --> 33:49.250
Jenkins Brown.

33:49.791 --> 33:52.833
Is this the one
we've been waiting for, Keziah?

33:52.916 --> 33:54.875
Has he come to free us both?

34:02.250 --> 34:04.041
G… G…

35:37.583 --> 35:38.708
That's the key.

35:41.125 --> 35:42.041
Twins.

36:27.291 --> 36:30.000
<i>Is this the one</i>
<i>we've been waiting for, Keziah?</i>

36:30.083 --> 36:34.083
<i>The transport of matter</i>
<i>from the next world to ours.</i>

36:35.125 --> 36:36.375
<i>Back again.</i>

37:34.625 --> 37:35.750
Walt!

37:35.833 --> 37:37.666
You have to go, now.

37:37.750 --> 37:40.583
Something stalked you here.
It followed you through the door.

37:40.666 --> 37:42.250
<i>Mm-hmm-hmm.</i>

37:42.333 --> 37:45.458
You're disturbing the forest,
causing ripples.

37:45.541 --> 37:47.291
-Oh my God.
-Run.

38:13.333 --> 38:14.333
Hide!

38:29.416 --> 38:32.083
-She's gone.
-You never should've come back.

38:32.166 --> 38:35.208
Listen to me, Epperley,
I can take you with me.

38:35.291 --> 38:36.416
What?

38:36.500 --> 38:41.166
When I ripped your gown,
that piece of fabric came back with me.

38:41.666 --> 38:43.708
-That's impossible.
-We're twins.

38:43.791 --> 38:47.000
The key that allows matter
to travel between dimensions.

38:47.083 --> 38:50.375
-I saw it in Keziah Mason's research.
-Keziah Mason?

38:51.958 --> 38:53.333
She wants to come back too.

38:53.416 --> 38:56.166
I promised to protect you.

38:56.916 --> 38:59.750
-Please let me take you home.
-Ha! Home.

38:59.833 --> 39:02.000
I would rather see
the wonders of the world

39:02.083 --> 39:03.750
than live dully at home.

39:03.833 --> 39:07.791
Drink, dance, enjoy life.

39:08.500 --> 39:11.125
Keziah, they're over here!

39:22.375 --> 39:24.625
No! You're not getting away!

39:24.708 --> 39:26.833
You're not going anywhere!

39:30.916 --> 39:32.166
Fuck off!

39:34.958 --> 39:35.916
Go!

39:36.000 --> 39:37.875
I will have you.

39:58.166 --> 39:59.583
Walt! No!

40:00.250 --> 40:01.416
Get off him!

40:01.500 --> 40:02.666
He's mine!

40:03.416 --> 40:05.833
No!

40:20.666 --> 40:21.708
Epperley.

40:32.875 --> 40:34.208
You brought me back.

40:34.875 --> 40:35.958
This is wrong.

40:54.291 --> 40:55.416
Be careful.

41:02.958 --> 41:04.500
Greetings, Walter.

41:04.583 --> 41:05.583
Go.

41:06.791 --> 41:07.791
Run!

41:08.916 --> 41:11.375
You can't escape me, boy!

41:17.833 --> 41:19.166
Open up, please!

41:20.666 --> 41:23.416
-What do you want?
-I live in the room on the other side.

41:23.500 --> 41:25.708
There's something in there
trying to hurt us.

41:28.041 --> 41:29.250
It's not human.

41:42.666 --> 41:44.041
I've seen you before.

41:44.666 --> 41:47.083
You've been meddling
in Keziah Mason's work.

41:47.791 --> 41:49.500
She lived in this house.

41:50.375 --> 41:51.375
In your room.

41:52.875 --> 41:55.666
I feel the energy her anger left behind.

41:57.250 --> 41:58.833
She was tortured at Salem.

41:59.958 --> 42:02.958
They stuck pins in her
to see if she would bleed.

42:04.958 --> 42:06.750
She compels me to paint

42:08.041 --> 42:09.083
my visions.

42:14.541 --> 42:16.125
What does it mean?

42:16.833 --> 42:17.958
My God.

42:20.250 --> 42:21.291
I know you.

42:33.250 --> 42:34.333
It's you.

42:36.541 --> 42:39.000
-What have you done?
-She won't hurt us.

42:40.166 --> 42:42.291
This is my sister. Her name is Epperley.

42:43.208 --> 42:44.541
You opened a door.

42:46.125 --> 42:48.458
You opened a door inside the witch house?

42:49.750 --> 42:51.833
Tell me Keziah didn't follow you.

42:53.458 --> 42:55.250
You brought her back with you.

42:55.333 --> 42:56.666
You left a ripple?

42:58.750 --> 43:00.458
I just wanted my sister back.

43:01.958 --> 43:02.791
See?

43:03.291 --> 43:04.666
She's getting stronger.

43:05.291 --> 43:06.500
Your sister is dead!

43:07.250 --> 43:08.708
Don't you understand that?

43:20.666 --> 43:21.625
It's you.

43:27.916 --> 43:30.000
Mutually exclusive.

43:30.708 --> 43:31.541
What?

43:31.625 --> 43:34.916
Your sister and Keziah in one circle.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.333
Yourself in the other.

43:39.125 --> 43:40.333
Two lost souls.

43:42.416 --> 43:43.541
And a living one.

43:45.708 --> 43:47.625
But they are mutually exclusive.

43:51.000 --> 43:52.708
For the dead to become flesh,

43:54.166 --> 43:55.583
the living must die.

43:59.208 --> 44:01.375
Walt, I didn't ask for this.

44:01.875 --> 44:03.916
There has to be another way.

44:04.000 --> 44:04.833
No.

44:07.500 --> 44:09.375
My paintings never lie.

44:12.291 --> 44:13.208
The witch

44:14.791 --> 44:16.666
will have you dead by sunrise.

44:23.625 --> 44:24.666
Epperley?

44:25.208 --> 44:26.208
Epperley!

44:28.333 --> 44:29.291
What can we do?

44:31.125 --> 44:32.583
Come.

44:32.666 --> 44:33.625
Quickly.

44:56.500 --> 44:57.333
You.

44:57.833 --> 45:00.125
I told you never to come back here.

45:00.708 --> 45:03.083
Sister, we are in need of sanctuary.

45:03.166 --> 45:06.458
You chose to meddle in forces
that have no place in God's house.

45:06.541 --> 45:09.583
Get out,
before I throw you out by the hair.

45:14.500 --> 45:16.000
And you…

45:18.166 --> 45:20.958
What demons have you been conjuring, boy?

45:22.583 --> 45:23.958
The dead want you now.

45:24.916 --> 45:27.208
Well, you won't bring them in here.

45:27.833 --> 45:30.250
Sister! We need your help.

45:30.916 --> 45:33.125
We can't fight this darkness alone.

45:36.125 --> 45:39.041
Neither of us want to submit to the Devil.

45:39.125 --> 45:42.166
We need your guidance to keep us firm.

45:45.125 --> 45:45.958
Please.

45:46.833 --> 45:49.500
Aren't all souls worthy of salvation?

45:58.416 --> 46:02.125
I will give you shelter
and pray for your souls,

46:02.625 --> 46:04.083
but I must warn you,

46:04.583 --> 46:07.458
even holy ground may not keep them at bay.

46:11.166 --> 46:14.375
I hope you understand
what you brought to this world.

46:15.416 --> 46:16.625
Thank you, Sister.

46:18.375 --> 46:19.416
Bless you.

46:20.333 --> 46:22.500
And don't mess up my floor.

46:25.375 --> 46:26.708
Is there a phone I could use?

46:35.250 --> 46:36.166
Walter!

46:37.125 --> 46:38.791
-Frank!

46:38.875 --> 46:40.208
Walter!

46:51.458 --> 46:53.833
Frank.

46:54.666 --> 46:55.708
Walter.

46:56.208 --> 46:59.500
-What's the matter?
-Spirits are after his soul.

46:59.583 --> 47:01.500
He brought them
from the Realm of the Dead.

47:01.583 --> 47:02.583
She's back, Frank.

47:03.333 --> 47:04.958
I brought Epperley back.

47:05.458 --> 47:08.083
-You need to see a doctor.
-No, no.

47:08.166 --> 47:09.500
It's true, I swear.

47:10.041 --> 47:13.083
She disappeared.
I think she's trying to protect me.

47:13.833 --> 47:16.375
She knows that for her to live,
I have to die.

47:16.458 --> 47:17.833
Mutually exclusive.

47:17.916 --> 47:20.291
This is madness.
I'm taking you to the hospital.

47:20.375 --> 47:23.000
You can't! He won't be safe there.

47:23.083 --> 47:24.125
Silence.

47:24.208 --> 47:27.958
<i>Wal-ter. </i>

47:28.041 --> 47:30.166
-She's trying to get in.
-Who?

47:30.666 --> 47:32.750
-Keziah Mason.
-<i>Walter.</i>

47:32.833 --> 47:35.500
She wants Gilman dead
to make her body flesh.

47:35.583 --> 47:37.875
Mutually exclusive.

47:38.375 --> 47:40.791
<i>Come to me.</i>

47:47.000 --> 47:50.041
<i>Walter, let me in.</i>

47:51.000 --> 47:52.041
Hold him!

47:52.833 --> 47:54.875
<i>For your sister to live,</i>

47:54.958 --> 47:58.625
<i>you must die.</i>

47:59.458 --> 48:00.458
Hold him!

48:01.625 --> 48:06.708
<i>Walter!</i>

48:06.791 --> 48:10.458
<i>Come to me.</i>

48:10.541 --> 48:12.458
Be gone, Devil!

48:21.625 --> 48:26.208
Walter!

48:26.291 --> 48:28.291
Get the fuck out of my church!

49:27.458 --> 49:28.875
Help me!

49:35.500 --> 49:36.875
Move!

49:39.708 --> 49:40.625
Agh!

49:41.125 --> 49:42.083
No!

49:57.916 --> 49:58.750
Epperley.

50:35.375 --> 50:36.375
Help!

50:37.166 --> 50:39.625
<i>Someone help me! </i>

50:40.750 --> 50:41.875
I can't.

50:53.458 --> 50:55.166
Do it, Keziah!

50:55.666 --> 50:57.041
Free us both!

51:01.041 --> 51:01.958
Stop!

51:02.041 --> 51:03.375
No!

51:11.000 --> 51:12.833
Oh-oh!

51:33.083 --> 51:33.958
Epperley,

51:34.750 --> 51:36.500
I don't wanna lose you again.

51:45.625 --> 51:47.250
I'm not scared anymore.

51:49.166 --> 51:50.500
Let me go.

51:51.625 --> 51:55.083
I love you so much.

52:05.541 --> 52:06.833
I love you, Walt.

52:20.458 --> 52:22.208
I'm finally free, Walt.

52:46.958 --> 52:49.875
It's over. It's over.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.916
The world will never know
what we went through last night.

53:05.750 --> 53:08.458
My painting said
he'd be dead before the sun rose.

53:11.958 --> 53:13.416
I'm glad I was wrong.

53:18.333 --> 53:22.666
I spent seven years
working at the Spiritualist Society,

53:23.958 --> 53:25.416
and all that time, I…

53:26.833 --> 53:28.458
I never saw a ghost.

53:33.666 --> 53:35.375
But you were right all along.

53:45.875 --> 53:46.833
What is that?

53:50.416 --> 53:51.666
Hand me that lantern.

54:02.958 --> 54:04.833
It's… It's the attic.

54:06.166 --> 54:07.125
Be careful.

54:28.041 --> 54:29.083
Still wet.

54:36.916 --> 54:38.125
It's rotten.

54:46.750 --> 54:49.083
-Oh! Oh!

55:07.666 --> 55:08.958
Ah! Ah! Oh.

55:11.041 --> 55:12.291
That's her.

55:20.625 --> 55:21.916
Ah.

56:10.625 --> 56:12.166
Their corporal bodies.

56:12.250 --> 56:13.958
It's a human skull.

56:15.291 --> 56:16.375
It's in me!

56:16.958 --> 56:19.166
It's in me! Argh!

56:19.250 --> 56:21.208
Walter! Walter!

56:28.375 --> 56:29.666
-Walter.
-Walter!

56:30.166 --> 56:33.208
No. What is it? What is it?!

56:36.666 --> 56:38.125
Walter. Walter!

56:38.916 --> 56:41.666
Walter! What's happening? What do we do?

56:41.750 --> 56:42.583
Is he dead?

56:45.791 --> 56:46.625
Ah!

56:47.333 --> 56:48.583
Oh, oh, oh.

56:50.958 --> 56:52.166
I think I hear something.

56:54.208 --> 56:55.083
A heartbeat.

57:05.083 --> 57:06.375
Agh!

57:11.125 --> 57:13.666
What I've done cannot be undone!

57:30.666 --> 57:32.541
Walter. Walter.

57:33.541 --> 57:34.666
Get a doctor!

57:37.250 --> 57:38.750
We need to get some help.

57:40.541 --> 57:41.708
Call a doctor!

57:43.458 --> 57:44.875
You're gonna be okay.

57:45.583 --> 57:46.541
Gonna be okay.

57:49.708 --> 57:51.791
-Stop it!
-There's nothing we can do.

57:52.750 --> 57:54.958
-We need to get help.
-Look.

57:57.875 --> 57:59.541
My paintings never lie.

58:02.375 --> 58:03.500
She won.

58:06.083 --> 58:07.833
-But--
-Look.

58:29.500 --> 58:32.375
I told you, you couldn't escape me.

59:07.708 --> 59:12.291
<i>And there it is,</i>
<i>a happy ending if there ever was one.</i>

59:32.083 --> 59:35.833
Home sweet home.

59:39.958 --> 59:42.541
<i>I'll ride this body</i>
<i>as long as it will last.</i>

59:42.625 --> 59:43.916
<i>After all,</i>

59:44.000 --> 59:46.375
<i>he wasn't doing anything with it, was he?</i>
