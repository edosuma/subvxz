- Be back in six weeks.

00:12.746 --> 00:15.977
[Nick] That's in my hometown.
I haven't been back in ten years.

00:16.049 --> 00:19.382
Thanks for going easy. I read
how you made Eddie and Hannah look...

00:19.452 --> 00:21.283
- I gotta warn you. Eddie...
- Yeah.

00:21.354 --> 00:23.481
Long time, Eddie.
Just stop it! Hey! Hey!

00:23.556 --> 00:26.684
You have forgotten which side
of October Road you belong on.

00:26.760 --> 00:31.663
Hello, Hannah. You're a mom, huh?
I didn't know that. How old is Sam?

00:31.731 --> 00:34.894
Ten. Don't worry. He's not yours.

00:35.001 --> 00:37.333
The men in my family
have peanut allergies.

00:37.404 --> 00:40.896
One bite of this peanut butter
and jelly sandwich and I'm a goner.

Oh, there he is.
Liz Taylor get her beauty sleep?

02:10.163 --> 02:14.930
- Not so much. That cat...
- Yeah, but what do you care?

02:15.001 --> 02:18.459
I mean, you get to go back to the
delightful sounds of New York City's

02:18.538 --> 02:22.201
gunshots and orgies, while we're
stuck here with the agonized cries

02:22.275 --> 02:24.368
of the horny neighborhood feline.

02:24.444 --> 02:28.346
Yeah, about New York.
I kind of called an audible last night.

02:29.949 --> 02:32.315
- You're staying?
- [Nick] Thinking about it.

02:33.086 --> 02:35.247
- [Commander] How long?
- [Nick] Not sure.

02:35.355 --> 02:39.018
- Few weeks. I mean, if that's OK.
- [Cat screeching]

02:39.092 --> 02:41.652
That's it! I can't take it!

02:43.630 --> 02:45.791
It's OK. Glad to have you.

02:46.799 --> 02:49.461
- Thanks.
- But, uh...

02:49.536 --> 02:52.596
- Have you accounted for the blow-back?
- The blow-back?

02:52.672 --> 02:55.835
It's, uh, one thing
to pay a visit after ten years.

02:55.942 --> 02:59.309
But, considering the number you
did on Knights Ridge in your book,

02:59.412 --> 03:03.075
you might meet resistance to your
settling into the daily hum and drum.

03:03.149 --> 03:06.209
You might encounter a blow-back.

03:06.286 --> 03:09.187
I'm finishing this, once and for all!

03:09.255 --> 03:11.018
[Commander] Is that a BB gun?

03:11.090 --> 03:14.389
Just 'cause you are an idiot
doesn't mean you need to act like one.

03:15.795 --> 03:19.856
Now, I gotta ask you.
What made you decide to stay?

03:19.933 --> 03:22.561
[Lkey] You really
think the kid is yours?

03:22.635 --> 03:26.093
Peanut allergy. He's got one.
Just like all the men in my family.

03:26.172 --> 03:28.436
That's way too much of a coincidence.

03:28.508 --> 03:31.671
[Phil] One percent of the population
are allergic to peanuts.

03:31.744 --> 03:34.679
Three million Americans.
There's a 60 percent chance

03:34.747 --> 03:37.045
of it originating
from a genetic inheritance.

03:37.116 --> 03:39.084
There's a 40 percent chance it don't!

03:39.152 --> 03:42.212
- Well done, Pythagoras.
- Thanks for playing.

03:42.288 --> 03:44.586
Pythagoras was a winged horse!
Greek myth.

03:44.657 --> 03:47.353
That would be Pegasus.
I appreciate the effort.

03:47.427 --> 03:51.056
<i>Spends ten years in New York City,

03:51.130 --> 03:53.860
If you're convinced you're the dad,
how do you play it?

03:53.933 --> 03:56.629
Only thing I can think of, ask Hannah.
Straight up.

03:56.703 --> 03:59.866
No. Dropping the allergy bomb
on Hannah will freak her out.

03:59.939 --> 04:01.770
Go slow. Get to know the kid better.

04:01.841 --> 04:03.570
Take it from a father of two,

04:03.643 --> 04:06.612
if he is your son, there'll be
no mistaking it. In time.

04:06.713 --> 04:08.647
But say he is your kid, what then?

04:08.715 --> 04:11.479
[Sighs] I don't know.

04:13.286 --> 04:16.846
Hey, Nick's staying, Eddie.
Isn't that great?

04:16.956 --> 04:19.048
I'm gonna go get my truck at Sully's.

04:21.394 --> 04:25.956
I better get going too. Have to
pick up Alison's outfit for date night.

04:26.065 --> 04:27.032
- Date night?
- Yeah.

04:27.133 --> 04:30.694
Once every three months, Owen
and Alison go out for a nice dinner,

04:30.770 --> 04:33.330
but not before picking out
outfits for each other.

04:33.406 --> 04:36.967
Yeah, it started
'cause I like her to dress sluttier

04:37.043 --> 04:38.738
and she likes me to dress...

04:38.811 --> 04:42.542
Like someone with the ability
to look in a mirror?

04:42.615 --> 04:43.775
- See ya.
- I'll see ya.

04:43.850 --> 04:45.909
- [Lkey] Later.
- [Owen] See ya, buddy.

04:45.985 --> 04:48.681
[Phil] I'll get that date night
mix CD I made for you.

04:48.755 --> 04:49.722
[Owen] Thanks.

04:49.822 --> 04:51.881
The only reason I told you that stuff

04:51.958 --> 04:56.122
about me and Owen's wife is
'cause I thought you were leaving town.

04:58.431 --> 05:00.399
You ain't gonna say nothing, are you?

05:00.500 --> 05:02.331
It was a one-shot deal, right?

05:02.402 --> 05:06.839
No need to ruin a family
over one stupid night, right?

05:08.741 --> 05:10.675
Give it up! Bloop!

05:19.385 --> 05:21.819
[Indistinct chatter]

05:23.389 --> 05:24.947
Hey, who's winning?

05:25.992 --> 05:30.895
Hey. No offense, but you're
really milking this goodbye tour.

05:32.198 --> 05:34.530
- Actually, I'm staying.
- Really?

05:34.600 --> 05:38.969
Yeah. So we...
we should hang out sometime.

05:40.273 --> 05:43.640
You know? Maybe, um, have a catch.

05:44.377 --> 05:45.674
A catch of what?

05:45.745 --> 05:49.374
You know, a catch. Baseball.
You throw the ball back and forth.

05:49.449 --> 05:53.180
Oh. Right. A catch.

05:53.519 --> 05:56.249
Hey, Doodie, Nick wants to have a catch.

05:56.322 --> 05:57.880
A catch of what?

05:58.624 --> 06:01.252
It was just an idea. We can...

06:01.327 --> 06:03.488
I gotta go walk my mom home from work.

06:03.596 --> 06:07.157
- You do that every day?
- Yeah. She's works for the vet.

06:07.233 --> 06:10.999
Oh, right.
Yeah, she always loved animals.

06:14.073 --> 06:15.938
OK.

06:18.578 --> 06:19.545
Hey, Nick.

06:21.447 --> 06:23.608
Maybe a catch would be fun sometime.

06:26.986 --> 06:28.351
Cool.

A sign of a rough night when you hoof
back to your wheels in the afternoon.

06:49.375 --> 06:52.242
- Sorry about the ruckus.
- No worries.

06:52.311 --> 06:55.872
Friends getting together after ten
years? Broken glassware is expected.

06:55.982 --> 06:58.280
Yeah, last night had
nothing to do with Nick.

06:58.351 --> 07:00.979
Right. And I eat corn dogs
for the corn.

07:03.256 --> 07:06.589
You know, the past is like
a pimple on prom night, Eddie.

07:06.659 --> 07:08.627
You can try and ignore it,

07:08.694 --> 07:11.254
but it'll still prevent
Jimmy from dancing with you

07:11.330 --> 07:14.356
during your favorite Boyz II Men song.

07:19.405 --> 07:22.306
[Train whistle blares]

07:34.454 --> 07:37.480
- Nick.
- Hannah.

07:41.427 --> 07:43.588
Sam told me you're staying.

07:43.663 --> 07:47.429
Yeah, I... I, uh,
wanted to actually talk to you...

07:47.500 --> 07:48.467
That's good.

07:48.568 --> 07:51.935
For you... I guess.

07:52.004 --> 07:56.464
But asking my son
to play catch, that is a problem.

07:56.542 --> 08:01.707
So here's the deal. It's cool
if you want to stay. I can't stop you.

08:01.781 --> 08:05.148
But I have worked very hard
to create a life for myself,

08:05.218 --> 08:08.483
and most importantly Sam.

08:08.554 --> 08:11.887
You can't just wander
into our lives, not now,

08:11.958 --> 08:14.483
and make things more confusing
for everyone.

08:14.560 --> 08:18.394
- Hey, look.
- It's... it's an applecart.

08:18.464 --> 08:23.333
- And... it's delicate.
- I'm not going to do nothing.

08:23.402 --> 08:25.370
- Really?
- I'm staying

08:25.438 --> 08:28.202
- because the college offered me a job.
- They did?

08:28.307 --> 08:30.070
- Yeah.
- To do what?

08:30.176 --> 08:35.078
To teach... the kids. For real.

08:35.147 --> 08:39.015
All I'm asking of you,
Nick, is just please,

08:39.085 --> 08:42.520
please, please, please!

08:42.587 --> 08:47.321
Just don't upset the applecart!

08:47.627 --> 08:50.790
- OK.
- OK.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.862
The college really offer you a job?

08:56.936 --> 09:01.032
- Not so much.
- Welcome to the blow-back.

09:10.650 --> 09:16.418
What you're saying is that she thinks
that you think that her kid is yours.

09:17.089 --> 09:21.355
- That is what I think.
- Aw, that's utter nonsense.

09:21.427 --> 09:23.759
You don't know everything.
There's things.

09:23.829 --> 09:26.559
There's evidence and clues and...
There's things.

09:27.633 --> 09:29.863
- We're talking the paper boy here.
- Yeah.

09:29.936 --> 09:33.099
He walks her home from work every day.
Isn't that sweet?

09:33.973 --> 09:36.737
All right. How do I look?

09:38.477 --> 09:39.774
You really gonna do this?

09:39.845 --> 09:43.747
I told her I got a job at the Doof.
So I gotta go get a job at the Doof.

09:43.816 --> 09:45.750
I thought you wiped out there.

09:45.818 --> 09:49.515
I did, but why wouldn't they want me?

09:49.589 --> 09:51.056
I'm a big-time novelist, Dad.

10:08.941 --> 10:10.499
[Woman] Is this a joke?

10:10.576 --> 10:14.034
Because if this is a joke,
I'm still stuck in the setup.

10:14.113 --> 10:18.277
Which, as you may recall, involved
you panicking and sputtering your way

10:18.351 --> 10:21.115
out of a one-day seminar
with a case of the dry heaves,

10:21.187 --> 10:23.849
leaving an entire lecture hall
in the lurch.

10:23.923 --> 10:26.653
And now you want me
to give you your own class?

10:26.726 --> 10:30.753
Just a little class.
A nice, little graduate writing class.

10:30.830 --> 10:32.593
What makes you think you can teach?

10:32.698 --> 10:36.361
And please don't tell me it's
because you wrote a popular novel.

10:36.435 --> 10:37.595
No. No.

10:37.670 --> 10:41.538
But the journey getting there,

10:41.607 --> 10:45.475
the journey those students wish to
embark upon, I can share my experience.

10:45.544 --> 10:49.480
- Then let's talk about that journey.
- Let's talk about it.

10:49.548 --> 10:52.779
The, um, epic struggle of a coward,

10:52.852 --> 10:57.414
who left his home, wrote a book about
the friends and family that he abandoned

10:57.490 --> 11:02.120
for reasons unknown and
now is afraid to face his own life.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.763
Wow. You're leaving out

11:05.831 --> 11:08.857
where I burned down the orphanage
and drunk-dialed the Pope.

11:08.934 --> 11:11.494
A teacher, by nature, is a leader.

11:11.570 --> 11:14.596
And a leader is someone
who embraces their life,

11:14.674 --> 11:16.699
not one who runs away from it.

11:16.776 --> 11:22.305
In other words, Mr. Garrett, my students
have nothing to learn from you.

11:25.017 --> 11:26.177
[Whispers] Oh, my God.

11:29.188 --> 11:34.922
And thus, the arsonist returns
to the scene of his last great blaze.

11:34.994 --> 11:37.258
Going down in flames
does seem to be the motif.

11:37.329 --> 11:40.298
What's the difference between
self pity and self loathing?

11:40.366 --> 11:43.529
I'd answer, but I'm too busy
feeling sorry for my vile existence.

11:43.602 --> 11:46.366
- Have you met this Dean Etwood?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

11:46.472 --> 11:48.963
- What about her?
- Just that she's like Stalin,

11:49.041 --> 11:51.737
only without the dreamy compassion.

11:51.811 --> 11:53.574
[Horn blowing]

12:00.453 --> 12:03.388
- Hey.
- Lotta beer.

12:03.456 --> 12:07.187
We're stockpiling. Ikey heard there
might be a nuclear war this weekend.

12:07.259 --> 12:10.592
True dat. Darcy, what goes on?

12:11.997 --> 12:14.295
You weren't gonna ever call, were you?

12:16.235 --> 12:18.863
Aw, no, not Darcy
from the hardware store?

12:18.938 --> 12:20.030
What?

12:20.106 --> 12:22.666
Dude, I liked Darcy
from the hardware store.

12:23.442 --> 12:27.105
Man, do you get around.
You're like the flu, only with a zipper.

12:27.580 --> 12:31.539
He don't call. What are you, new?
This is Eddie Latekka.

12:31.650 --> 12:36.110
Repeat business makes him nervous.
No offense. His bad, not yours.

12:38.290 --> 12:40.383
- [Laughs]
- What's so funny?

12:40.459 --> 12:44.156
Look, son. You're pushing 30.
Are you ever going to get married?

12:44.230 --> 12:48.758
When did that line between selling booze
and being pals become blurred?

12:48.834 --> 12:51.598
Look, all I'm saying is what's next?

12:53.706 --> 12:55.606
No idea.

12:57.977 --> 12:59.672
It's wild that you grew up here.

12:59.745 --> 13:02.908
- Why?
- Mm, I don't know. It's just so...

13:03.015 --> 13:04.312
...quaint.

13:04.383 --> 13:08.251
- Berkeley isn't quaint?
- No, it is, but quaint with an edge.

13:08.320 --> 13:10.413
- Edgy quaint.
- Barefoot quaint.

13:10.489 --> 13:12.616
- Patchouli quaint.
- Kill the rich quaint.

13:12.691 --> 13:15.660
Speaking of which,
the bill collectors can't be barking.

13:15.761 --> 13:17.854
Why are you sweating this job thing?

13:18.931 --> 13:21.491
- It feels right.
- Qualify.

13:23.536 --> 13:26.061
OK, well...

13:27.373 --> 13:29.841
It's like, if I can't do that,
then what good am I?

13:29.909 --> 13:34.005
And... and who knows? You know,
maybe someday I become a dad.

13:34.079 --> 13:37.378
Isn't that what you're supposed
to do with children, teach them?

13:39.285 --> 13:43.449
I think you gotta flip the script.
Make a case for yourself with the dean.

13:43.556 --> 13:47.219
You're in your hometown. There's
gotta be someone who can vouch for you.

13:47.293 --> 13:51.161
Someone who can speak to the virtues
of Nick, not Nicholson, Garrett.

13:51.230 --> 13:54.757
There's gotta be someone. [laughs]

13:56.101 --> 13:59.468
You gonna be OK with this
Nicky stayin' in The Ridge thing?

13:59.538 --> 14:01.631
Not much choice, right?

14:01.707 --> 14:05.143
There's gotta be some sort
of a reckoning, a payback.

14:05.211 --> 14:08.374
- What kind of payback?
- I'll know it when I see it.

14:08.447 --> 14:10.972
The universe will provide.

14:11.984 --> 14:16.216
Check it. There's Nicky now,
with that lolly from the other night.

14:16.288 --> 14:19.348
The one you practically
KO'd with your thuggery.

14:19.425 --> 14:22.758
Is that right? That her?

14:24.530 --> 14:27.226
I think he digs her.
Yeah, why wouldn't he?

14:27.299 --> 14:29.563
I mean, she's, uh... She's, uh...

14:32.438 --> 14:36.499
Bro, you're not gonna...

14:43.148 --> 14:45.082
God, I love the universe.

14:50.389 --> 14:50.422
Somewhere in these boxes
is my tenth grade report card,

14:50.422 --> 14:53.949
Somewhere in these boxes
is my tenth grade report card,

14:54.026 --> 14:57.393
penned by Mrs. Gertrude Weiner.
Now if memory serves,

14:57.463 --> 15:00.489
Mrs. Weiner waxed rhapsodic
in those pages,

15:00.566 --> 15:03.091
a love letter
to all things Nick Garrett.

15:03.168 --> 15:06.797
And you think that if you present it
to the dean, she'll see the light?

15:06.872 --> 15:09.397
Exactly. The dean gives me the job.

15:09.475 --> 15:13.309
Hannah sees that I'm committed.
I have a function.

15:13.379 --> 15:15.347
Hannah tells me the truth about Sam.

15:15.447 --> 15:18.883
Handing over a 12-year-old
report card as a job reference...

15:18.951 --> 15:23.081
It may come across a little... goofy.

15:23.155 --> 15:27.717
See, I thought about that,
but the goofiness is part of the plan.

15:27.826 --> 15:30.192
- It's charm.
- [Doorbell rings]

15:30.296 --> 15:32.025
I'll get it.

15:33.098 --> 15:36.590
- Hey.
- Hey, Sam.

15:38.270 --> 15:39.965
You ready for that catch?

15:41.006 --> 15:46.069
Uh... You know,
now's not really a good time.

15:46.145 --> 15:49.239
Oh. Well, I'll come back later.

15:49.315 --> 15:53.479
Um... I don't think so. Um...

15:55.154 --> 15:59.113
I... I'm gonna be busy... indefinitely.

15:59.191 --> 16:01.682
Indefinitely?

16:01.760 --> 16:04.320
Like... forever?

16:04.396 --> 16:08.298
Not forever. But just for now.

16:09.234 --> 16:13.330
Oh. OK.

16:24.984 --> 16:29.683
Bang! Boom! You just gave
the Heisman to a ten-year-old.

16:29.755 --> 16:31.313
Hannah told me to stay away.

16:31.423 --> 16:33.948
Well, even so,
I mean, that's cold, brophus!

16:34.026 --> 16:37.553
That... that's popsicle cold!
Polar-bear cold! Eskimo cold!

16:37.629 --> 16:40.792
- Igloo cold!
- I got it, Ronny!

16:42.901 --> 16:46.234
You know the first thing legislated
when rebuilding New Orleans?

16:46.305 --> 16:50.139
They went Wi-Fi. Hooked up the
entire city up with wireless Internet.

16:50.209 --> 16:53.770
Good enough for a city under water,
good enough for Knights Ridge.

16:54.380 --> 16:56.905
- Hey!
- Jasper! Casper!

16:56.982 --> 16:59.712
What do you say you boys
don't do that? OK?

16:59.785 --> 17:01.912
Don't play with your peas.

17:07.192 --> 17:11.492
[Sighs] So, Sam.
How's life in the hustle?

17:11.563 --> 17:13.087
Peaks and valleys.

17:14.532 --> 17:18.195
- Is this about Nick?
- Nick? What about Nick?

17:18.270 --> 17:20.704
I told you, sweetie,
Nick is just visiting.

17:20.772 --> 17:24.140
That's how you have to think.
You shouldn't let it hurt your feelings.

17:24.242 --> 17:26.211
- Lf...
- Can I be excused?

17:27.880 --> 17:28.904
OK.

17:32.551 --> 17:34.917
Plates in the sink.

17:38.357 --> 17:39.449
What?

17:40.759 --> 17:44.320
- If I say it, it's gonna be a thing.
- Say it.

17:45.030 --> 17:48.966
OK. It's just...

17:49.034 --> 17:51.332
...you invite me and the boys
for a nice dinner

17:51.403 --> 17:54.531
and I'm sitting here looking
into your beautiful eyes,

17:54.606 --> 17:56.733
enjoying your cranberry pork chop,

17:56.809 --> 18:00.370
only to find out there's hidden drama
with Nick Garrett, you and Sam.

18:00.446 --> 18:03.415
- There's no hidden drama.
- How would I know?

18:12.491 --> 18:17.986
All that I want, all I have ever worked
for, is for us to one day be a family.

18:18.063 --> 18:21.499
I'm sorry about
the way my boys torment Sam.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.592
I'm just trying
to make things right here.

18:24.670 --> 18:29.505
I know you are,
and you've been amazing.

18:29.575 --> 18:33.602
We're good.
Nick can't change any of that.

18:33.679 --> 18:36.614
He probably won't even
stick around, and if he does,

18:36.682 --> 18:38.309
so what?

18:40.385 --> 18:42.853
We're good right now, Ray.

18:48.427 --> 18:51.157
We're good.

Dude, is that Eddie Latekka
crossing O-Road and going to the Doof?

19:48.053 --> 19:50.078
Eddie Latekka never goes to the Doof.

20:35.767 --> 20:38.258
Hey, kid, come here!

20:38.503 --> 20:41.734
Wait! Hold on! I wanna get a look at ya!

[Cat moaning]

20:47.879 --> 20:49.847
Here, kitty.

21:01.860 --> 21:03.327
- Hello, Hannah.
- Hello.

21:03.395 --> 21:06.159
My pet here needs a little attending to.

21:06.231 --> 21:08.392
- This is yours?
- Yeah, that's right.

21:08.500 --> 21:12.596
- How old is this cat?
- He's seven.

21:12.671 --> 21:17.233
- This cat is a female.
- [Laughs] Yeah.

21:17.309 --> 21:22.440
- And, um, what's her name?
- Sunrise.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.641
What's wrong with Sunrise?

21:26.718 --> 21:31.348
I don't know.
He's just a little, um... sluggish.

21:31.423 --> 21:35.189
- She.
- She. Is that your son?

21:35.260 --> 21:37.285
Mm-hm. Sam.

21:40.399 --> 21:43.527
- You're my paper boy.
- Yeah.

21:52.010 --> 21:54.376
I'll have Dr. Jeffers take a look.

21:54.479 --> 21:57.346
- Huh?
- I'll have Dr. Jeffers take a look.

21:57.416 --> 22:00.283
Oh, that'd be great.
I'll... I'll be back for him later.

22:00.352 --> 22:05.221
- Her.
- Her! Her. Um, goodbye, Sunrise.

22:09.795 --> 22:13.561
- Why did he bring Bumper here?
- I have no idea.

22:16.702 --> 22:19.762
This is our cat.

22:22.941 --> 22:27.241
Hey. You, um, got a second?

22:27.312 --> 22:30.372
Well, not if the upshot
is catastrophic injury.

22:30.449 --> 22:34.408
No. Nothing like that. I just want to
apologize for roughing up your friend.

22:34.519 --> 22:37.079
A few too many tequilas,
misguided anger.

22:37.155 --> 22:40.522
Mm-hm. Yep. So you, uh,
you have a problem with Nick Garrett?

22:40.592 --> 22:44.688
Garrett? Naw. I went to high school
with the guy, but I hardly know him.

22:44.763 --> 22:49.223
- God, I haven't been here in years.
- It was occasioned by what?

22:49.301 --> 22:54.238
Well, my desire to make things right
by you. And um, to give you this.

22:56.541 --> 23:00.375
- You made me a mix?
- I made you a mix.

23:03.615 --> 23:05.674
- I'm Aubrey.
- Eddie.

23:05.751 --> 23:09.243
Interesting selections.
Especially track two.

23:09.321 --> 23:13.849
Pegged you for more of a John Cougar
Mellencamp guy than a John Cougar guy.

23:13.925 --> 23:17.759
So, uh, maybe want
to hang out sometime,

23:17.829 --> 23:21.925
talk a little more evolution of
Mellencamp? Little pink houses and such?

23:22.000 --> 23:23.365
Tonight good?

23:23.468 --> 23:28.303
- I'm meeting some friends at Sully's.
- Maybe I stop by?

23:28.974 --> 23:30.441
Maybe you do.

23:44.556 --> 23:45.523
Hey.

23:48.460 --> 23:51.293
- You and Ma.
- Yeah.

23:51.363 --> 23:54.332
She'd have got a kick out of
the fanciness you got going on.

23:54.399 --> 23:57.459
I don't know.

23:57.536 --> 24:01.438
I think she might've been creased
for me staying away ten years.

24:01.506 --> 24:05.602
But you're back now, where you belong.
That's all that counts.

24:05.677 --> 24:08.510
It's how you close the game,
not the score at half-time.

24:11.750 --> 24:14.082
Hold on. Pay dirt!

24:14.152 --> 24:18.521
- Is that the report card?
- Yeah. But it's wounded.

24:19.825 --> 24:22.521
Smudged. It's unreadable.

24:25.931 --> 24:27.296
Game over.

24:27.365 --> 24:31.324
Not true. We can do much better. Forget
about handing in ancient documents.

24:31.403 --> 24:34.031
Nothing beats a live testimonial.

24:34.105 --> 24:38.542
It's like I always say, if you can't
deliver the bacon, bring 'em the pig.

24:38.610 --> 24:41.977
- You always say that?
- Well, I will from now on.

24:42.080 --> 24:45.243
If you can't deliver the bacon,
bring 'em the pig.

24:50.889 --> 24:54.154
- Thank you for seeing me again.
- You said you were bringing pie.

24:54.226 --> 24:55.352
No, I didn't.

24:55.427 --> 24:59.796
My assistant told me, "Nicholson Garrett
called to say he'd like to come by again

24:59.898 --> 25:03.265
but this time he's bringing pie."
That's why I agreed.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.701
- No pie?
- No pie.

25:05.770 --> 25:08.637
- Then good day.
- Just hear me out.

25:08.707 --> 25:10.732
OK, I know how you feel about me.

25:10.809 --> 25:14.108
And I know that there's nothing
that I can say to change your mind.

25:14.179 --> 25:18.115
But how about the words
of a fellow teacher?

25:18.183 --> 25:20.549
I present Ms. Gertrude Weiner,

25:20.619 --> 25:24.180
forty-five-year veteran of
the Massachusetts educational system,

25:24.256 --> 25:26.224
and my tenth grade English teacher.

25:26.324 --> 25:28.349
How do you do? It's a pleasure.

25:28.426 --> 25:33.329
I, um, I just want you to know that
Nicholas is a wonderful young man.

25:33.398 --> 25:39.098
Watching him maneuver his way through
semi-colons, I knew he would go far.

25:39.170 --> 25:41.536
Think of what he
can bring to the students.

25:41.640 --> 25:45.940
I am thinking of the students.
That's why I am not hiring Mr. Garrett.

25:46.011 --> 25:49.947
Because he is the very worst thing
a teacher can be: A dilettante.

25:50.015 --> 25:53.382
Someone who does a job
to suit his momentary needs.

25:55.220 --> 25:56.585
Reminds me of another man

25:56.688 --> 26:00.920
who came down to teach at a school
in a parish of New Orleans.

26:00.992 --> 26:02.960
Only this man,

26:03.061 --> 26:07.725
he told the students that they could
learn to sing, and so he sang to them.

26:07.799 --> 26:11.166
<i>And the song was, uh,
Where is Love? from the show Oliver.</i>

26:11.269 --> 26:13.362
But then this man,

26:13.438 --> 26:17.932
he left soon after,
back to his real life,

26:18.009 --> 26:20.944
leaving the students devastated.

26:21.012 --> 26:26.382
I remember that because
I was one of those children.

26:26.484 --> 26:30.113
And I remember the crushing
sense of loss when that man left.

26:30.188 --> 26:34.056
So do not talk to me
about the students, Mrs. Weiner,

26:34.125 --> 26:38.619
because everything I do,
every fiber of my being,

26:38.697 --> 26:42.565
- is for these students.

sidewalk and some ridiculous story...

seen you pass up an opportunity.

chit-chat about meaningless bock

Oh, honey, we are well
past the intrusion phase.

29:10.281 --> 29:12.044
This is more like an invasion.

Look, I'm trying to confront
the stuff that I ran from years ago.

29:16.554 --> 29:20.456
And I'm willing to face anything,
anything that comes my way.

29:20.525 --> 29:24.291
I will not leave you,
Dean Etwood, or your students either.

now, Mr. Garret, I am going to sleep.

31:12.337 --> 31:16.103
Done. Shall we?

31:22.380 --> 31:24.678
See you, guys.

31:24.749 --> 31:30.085
The Talking Raccoon. Fail proof.

31:31.489 --> 31:34.583
[Owen] Hello, everybody.
Here we are. Da!

31:34.659 --> 31:37.423
OK. Thank you. Hi.

31:38.496 --> 31:39.656
You like my...

31:39.764 --> 31:42.460
- Another date night for the Rowans.
- Lame.

31:42.533 --> 31:46.560
I think it's cute, the way they
keep the torch of married love alive.

31:46.638 --> 31:51.598
What's he got on? Six shooters
and spurs or is he Robin Hood again?

31:51.676 --> 31:54.008
[Laughing] It's toned down
from last month.

31:54.078 --> 31:59.106
- Uh, tail coat and a top hat for him.
- Mmm. Yeah, sounds mad discreet.

31:59.183 --> 32:02.550
- And for, uh... What's her name again?
- Alison.

32:02.654 --> 32:06.283
Right. A, uh, slutty,

32:06.357 --> 32:09.383
super-sexy cocktail dress.

32:19.070 --> 32:22.096
Oh, hey, buddy.
Come on, have a drink with us.

32:22.173 --> 32:24.903
I'm good. You guys do your thing.

32:24.976 --> 32:28.742
You sure? All right, buddy.
Do our thing.

32:33.051 --> 32:37.784
- Hey, lkey.
- Hi, great. Go get 'em, Pythagoras.

32:38.122 --> 32:39.589
- [Knocking]
- Hey, Ralphie.

32:39.657 --> 32:42.023
Come on out. We got company!

32:42.093 --> 32:43.993
- [Knocking]
- Ralphie, come out.

32:44.062 --> 32:46.223
You really gonna play
this whole thing out?

32:46.297 --> 32:51.394
Oh, uh, he does this every now
and again. Don't worry, he'll appear.

32:51.469 --> 32:55.235
- Ralphie?
- [Phil] What's the racket down there?

32:56.174 --> 32:58.540
Hey, Phil, is Ralphie around?

32:58.609 --> 33:02.773
I heard him come in. But he
might've gone back out for smokes.

33:02.847 --> 33:05.577
Wow. You guys are seriously bent.

33:05.650 --> 33:08.210
Whoa, this is no laughing matter.

33:08.286 --> 33:10.754
OK, Ralphie has tried
to quit many times before.

33:10.822 --> 33:13.552
Big Tobacco's really got
their claws in that raccoon.

33:13.624 --> 33:18.721
Oh, did you hear that?
I think Ralphie might be home.

33:19.797 --> 33:21.162
Ralphie, is that you?

33:21.265 --> 33:24.234
[Rasping voice]
What do you want, Latekka?

33:24.302 --> 33:29.001
Come say hi. We got a visitor.
[As Ralphie] Leave me alone!

33:29.807 --> 33:33.868
- He gets a little cranky.
- [Aubrey laughs]

33:33.945 --> 33:37.210
Dude, would you just... Don't be rude.
Come out for two seconds.

33:37.281 --> 33:40.717
[As Ralphie] I'm tired, all right?
It's been a long day.

33:40.785 --> 33:44.721
Who is the babe, though? Very hot.

33:44.789 --> 33:48.122
No wonder Nick Garrett's
got a thing for her, huh?

33:51.929 --> 33:54.693
See that? There really
is a talking raccoon.

33:54.766 --> 33:57.530
I believe it's time
to cash in on my winnings.

33:57.635 --> 34:00.695
- Wow, really?
- What?

34:00.772 --> 34:03.332
What was that Ralphie said
about Nick Garrett?

34:03.408 --> 34:07.071
What? Uh, I dunno. He's drunk.

34:07.145 --> 34:11.103
- So that's what this is all about.
- What?

34:11.181 --> 34:13.742
Somewhere, in the frozen tundra
of your brain,

34:13.851 --> 34:16.752
you think getting with me
is gonna bother Nick, right?

34:16.821 --> 34:19.654
And the very idea
of that makes you feel tall?

34:19.724 --> 34:22.955
- No, that... that's not what this is.
- Isn't it, though?

34:23.027 --> 34:27.190
That this is... all about that?

34:27.297 --> 34:29.458
So, what if it is?

34:30.701 --> 34:32.134
Now that you're here...

34:32.203 --> 34:36.367
I'm here because I'm 23 and I'm stupid.
What's your excuse?

34:39.342 --> 34:42.641
Hey, Ralphie, you seem like a nice guy.

34:42.713 --> 34:45.273
You can do better
than Casa-no-good, over here.

34:52.690 --> 34:55.056
Thanks for nothin', pal.

34:57.061 --> 34:59.325
[Alison] Can I get
two champagne cocktails?

34:59.397 --> 35:00.762
- Comin' up.
- Thank you.

35:03.634 --> 35:06.398
- I left you a message.
- I know.

35:06.471 --> 35:11.602
- And, uh, you never called back.
- I, uh... Things were hectic.

35:16.948 --> 35:19.314
- See you Tuesday?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:22.120 --> 35:23.087
Great dress.

35:24.489 --> 35:27.981
- Hey.
- [Laughs] Hello, Mr. Eichorn.

35:28.493 --> 35:30.120
Hey...

35:33.264 --> 35:34.959
[Hannah] Thank you.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.661
You said you had news.

35:38.169 --> 35:43.004
- I got a job... at the Doof.
- You told me.

35:43.407 --> 35:48.777
Right. I know...
You know. I told you.

35:48.880 --> 35:51.781
I'm really sorry about my dad.
I swear, I had no idea.

35:54.752 --> 35:57.915
- But about Sam...
- Yeah?

35:58.022 --> 36:02.925
Look, I completely respect you
being protective over him

36:02.994 --> 36:04.757
and I would not want to offend that.

36:06.531 --> 36:10.023
But... something slipped out
the other day,

36:10.101 --> 36:13.264
something that Sam
said and... about...

36:14.805 --> 36:16.170
...his peanut allergy.

36:16.674 --> 36:21.373
Sure, Sam has a peanut allergy. So?

36:21.445 --> 36:25.211
So, all the men in my family
have peanut allergies,

36:25.316 --> 36:29.218
which are kinda rare and considering
the math on when I left town...

36:29.287 --> 36:31.755
- You are unbelievable.
- A 60 percent chance

36:31.822 --> 36:34.848
of nut allergies originating
from a genetic inheritance.

36:34.926 --> 36:37.417
Which means what? He's your son?

36:37.495 --> 36:39.156
I just think that's kind of rare.

36:39.230 --> 36:40.720
- Not that rare.
- Yeah, it is.

36:40.798 --> 36:43.130
- No, it's not.
- One percent of the population,

36:43.201 --> 36:45.362
three million Americans have it.

36:54.312 --> 36:58.442
- Excuse me, everyone!
- What are you doing?

36:58.516 --> 37:01.417
Can I see a show of hands
for everyone with a nut allergy?

37:01.485 --> 37:02.782
Will you please sit down?

37:02.853 --> 37:06.516
- [Man] What'd she say?
- Can we talk like adults, please?

37:08.759 --> 37:11.455
I'm serious! Put them up.
I know you're out there.

37:18.402 --> 37:20.370
[Nick whispering] Oh, my God.

37:28.746 --> 37:33.046
- You got a peanut allergy too?
- Maybe.

37:33.117 --> 37:35.677
See? It's not that rare.

37:37.221 --> 37:40.315
Good night, Nick, and goodbye.

37:42.126 --> 37:43.286
Hannah.

37:44.528 --> 37:47.497
Gavin Goddard.
That is Sam's father's name.

37:47.565 --> 37:51.126
He was a philosophy major at Harvard.
I met him a month after you left

37:51.235 --> 37:52.327
at a pub in Boston.

37:52.403 --> 37:56.840
He had a goatee and a tattoo
of the Notorious B.I.G. On his back.

37:56.907 --> 38:01.867
You want more details?
How about this one?

38:02.813 --> 38:07.648
I did it because I knew, in my bones,
that you were never coming home to me.

38:11.322 --> 38:13.222
Are you satisfied?

38:13.291 --> 38:15.987
<i>[# Poison: Every Rose Has Lts Thorn]</i>

39:53.657 --> 39:54.817
Hey.

39:55.893 --> 40:00.057
- What happened to the brunette?
- Eh, she wasn't an animal person.

40:01.098 --> 40:02.190
What's up with lkey?

40:02.266 --> 40:05.827
Don't know.
He was hittin' it pretty hard tonight.

40:05.903 --> 40:08.064
- Want me to drag him outta here?
- No need.

40:08.172 --> 40:11.733
Spent plenty of nights in that booth.
Find his way home when he wakes up.

40:11.842 --> 40:15.539
- Buy one for the house?
- Certainly.

40:16.947 --> 40:19.438
I've always said,
Eddie, as shady as it may be,

40:19.517 --> 40:24.614
ya gotta admire a guy who conjures up
a talking raccoon to impress the ladies.

40:24.688 --> 40:26.053
[Laughing]

40:26.223 --> 40:30.990
Think maybe what I gotta work on is the
type of ladies I'm trying to impress.

40:31.829 --> 40:34.127
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

40:35.433 --> 40:36.400
Mm.

40:37.835 --> 40:39.803
- Night, Janet.
- Night.

40:43.274 --> 40:46.175
[Sighs] Here you go, pal.

40:59.523 --> 41:01.753
[Eddie] Uh...

41:01.826 --> 41:04.454
Maybe sometime you want
to come and meet Ernesto,

41:04.528 --> 41:07.088
the singing Koala bear
who lives in my attic?

41:09.266 --> 41:11.166
Are you asking me out, Eddie?

41:13.237 --> 41:18.197
I don't know. I guess.

41:23.747 --> 41:26.045
Just think about it.

41:27.918 --> 41:31.684
Tell you what... I'll think about it.

41:32.790 --> 41:34.849
- Night.
- Night.
