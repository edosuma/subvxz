<i>They're taking fire from the woods.
They're waiting for the tanks.</i>

00:21.212 --> 00:24.357
<i>Enemy fire from our right flank.
I say again, our right flank.</i>

00:30.639 --> 00:32.415
<i>Princess Red 6 for Culture.</i>

00:32.515 --> 00:35.410
<i>Hold fast. This is the
worst of it, boys. Over.</i>

00:35.977 --> 00:37.587
<i>Sergeant Humphrey just showed up.</i>

00:37.687 --> 00:40.790
<i>Have you any information
on the right flank?</i>

00:42.092 --> 00:44.627
<i>Culture, that's a negative. Move.</i>

00:45.779 --> 00:50.884
<i>This is Able 2. The 88 is in that church.
They threw one at us when we drove by.</i>

01:05.715 --> 01:08.651
<i>Negative. It's all over!</i>

01:12.305 --> 01:14.407
<i>Come in, come in.</i>

01:15.725 --> 01:19.120
<i>Do you read me? Do you read me?</i>

04:32.464 --> 04:34.315
Son of a bitch!

04:42.599 --> 04:44.701
Did you get that fucker?

04:47.228 --> 04:49.205
Knocked him off.

05:02.410 --> 05:04.387
Gordo, stop. Leave him rest.

05:06.748 --> 05:07.932
Gordo, he's dead.

05:08.917 --> 05:13.396
He's dead! Show some respect.
Leave him alone.

05:16.716 --> 05:18.118
He's your fault!

05:18.218 --> 05:20.236
God damn it. Ain't you done yet?

05:20.637 --> 05:23.582
You got no right to be fucking sore
with me. Quit fucking riding me.

05:23.682 --> 05:26.618
I ain't riding you.
If I was riding you, you'd know it.

05:26.810 --> 05:28.244
More where he came from.

05:28.395 --> 05:30.747
Hey, fuck you, Don!
It's your fucking fault we here.

05:31.064 --> 05:33.083
Are you still talking?
Let's get out of here.

05:34.192 --> 05:36.261
Fuck! What the fuck you do that for?

05:36.361 --> 05:38.263
- I'm trying to fix it!
- You know why.

05:38.363 --> 05:41.633
You want to fucking whup me?
It ain't gonna fucking help anything!

05:43.118 --> 05:44.728
Probate, Fox 6.

05:44.828 --> 05:47.147
I say, why you always whupping on me?

05:47.247 --> 05:50.775
'Cause you're an animal, a dog.
All you understand is the fist and boot.

05:50.875 --> 05:52.736
Don, I'm telling you right now,
don't fucking call me that.

05:52.836 --> 05:54.771
I ain't a fucking animal.
I ain't a fucking dog.

05:54.871 --> 05:56.325
<i>Vámonos, cabrón. Vámonos.</i>

05:56.425 --> 06:00.076
Hey, you want to talk Mexican,
join another tank, a Mexican tank.

06:00.176 --> 06:02.370
This is an American tank,
we talk American.

06:02.470 --> 06:06.374
Who put the fucking nickel in you, Top?
You talk Kraut!

06:06.474 --> 06:08.293
You talk German! I can't talk Spanish?

06:08.443 --> 06:09.920
- Bible, what country we in?
- Germany.

06:10.020 --> 06:11.871
Germany, they speak German.

06:13.231 --> 06:16.301
- Could you explain to him it's a tool of war?
- It's a tool of war, Gordo.

06:16.401 --> 06:18.461
Here's my tool of war.

06:18.653 --> 06:19.638
Top.

06:19.738 --> 06:23.883
You knew German before we got in this
fucking war! Don't play stupid with me.

06:24.200 --> 06:26.761
I expect all of you to
pull your shit together.

06:28.204 --> 06:31.683
I wish you'd stop ragging on everyone.
You didn't kill Red, Germans did.

06:32.250 --> 06:34.519
That is true, but I
didn't save him, either.

06:34.628 --> 06:38.782
His number came up, that's all.
We've been lucky till now.

06:38.882 --> 06:41.451
- We've been lucky?
- Yes, sir.

06:41.551 --> 06:44.896
- We're all alive. We're in here.
- God's grace?

07:03.073 --> 07:04.299
Rain's coming.

07:10.497 --> 07:12.057
Coon-Ass, anytime, sweetheart.

07:12.415 --> 07:14.818
I'm your sweetheart, right?

07:14.918 --> 07:18.655
Okay. Gordo, crank her up.

07:21.299 --> 07:24.027
- Choke her up. She's cold.
- There's condensation on the plugs.

07:26.346 --> 07:27.447
Fuckers!

07:31.059 --> 07:32.786
All right, move out. Get us out of here.

07:37.607 --> 07:40.210
- Bible, gun front.
- Roger.

09:31.054 --> 09:32.489
Come on, move it!

09:33.348 --> 09:35.975
Get those cases out of here!

09:47.237 --> 09:49.072
I thought you were dead.

09:51.700 --> 09:55.270
- Devil watches over his own. Binkowski.
- Good to see you.

09:55.370 --> 09:57.180
Don, glad you made it back.

09:57.414 --> 09:59.649
Crew still together? Nate? Lindburgh?

09:59.749 --> 10:00.892
Doing well.

10:02.210 --> 10:03.520
Good.

10:07.966 --> 10:09.743
- Grab his arm.
- Here you go.

10:09.843 --> 10:11.161
Okay.

10:11.261 --> 10:12.821
Lay him down. Lay him down.

10:13.430 --> 10:14.698
Move.

10:17.851 --> 10:19.661
Set him down soft.

10:23.231 --> 10:24.541
Sergeant.

10:26.651 --> 10:28.211
Sergeant.

10:29.946 --> 10:31.047
Lift.

10:35.201 --> 10:37.262
Where's the rest of Third Platoon?

10:40.040 --> 10:41.558
We're it.

10:47.547 --> 10:48.865
Hey, Boyd?

10:48.965 --> 10:52.410
Hey, Boyd, they...
They gonna send him home, right?

10:52.510 --> 10:54.912
I don't know that, Grady.

10:55.305 --> 10:59.600
Red's got us all a little sad right now,
but we got a job to do.

10:59.976 --> 11:04.330
Grady, restock ammo and rations.
Gordo, water and gas.

11:04.648 --> 11:07.717
Boyd, get some chow and do what you can
about the mechanical issues.

11:07.817 --> 11:11.254
We can't do shit about mechanical issues.
Where you going?

11:58.118 --> 12:00.520
First Sergeant Collier?

12:00.620 --> 12:03.765
- Maybe. What the fuck are you?
- Private Ellison.

12:04.207 --> 12:07.686
I was told to report to you.
I'm your new assistant driver.

12:10.672 --> 12:12.399
No, you are not.

12:13.091 --> 12:15.952
- Yes, yes, I am.
- God damn it.

12:16.803 --> 12:19.456
- Who told you this?
- Master Sergeant with the clipboard.

12:19.556 --> 12:20.990
- Bullshit!
- Right there. He's...

12:24.436 --> 12:26.162
What's your name?

12:27.355 --> 12:28.748
Norman.

12:34.070 --> 12:36.381
How long you been in the Army?

12:37.407 --> 12:39.092
Eight weeks.

12:41.995 --> 12:43.263
That's home.

12:44.331 --> 12:48.685
Do as you're told.
Don't get too close to anyone.

12:55.550 --> 12:58.219
<i>On a hill far away</i>

12:59.429 --> 13:02.040
<i>Stood an old rugged cross</i>

13:02.682 --> 13:06.410
<i>The emblem of suffering and shame</i>

13:08.146 --> 13:10.748
<i>I love the old cross</i>

13:10.899 --> 13:13.260
<i>Where the dearest...</i>

13:13.360 --> 13:16.179
<i>I will cling to the old rugged cross</i>

13:16.279 --> 13:19.049
Hi. Hi. I'm Norman.

13:26.414 --> 13:29.225
Which... Which way is the front?

13:29.793 --> 13:32.020
"Which way is the front?"

13:34.673 --> 13:37.859
All around us, kid, 'cause this is Germany.
We're surrounded by Krauts.

13:38.760 --> 13:41.571
- Ain't that right, Grady?
- That's right.

13:49.562 --> 13:51.331
Can I please have my book back?

13:51.731 --> 13:54.876
- Where are the cigarettes?
- I don't smoke.

13:55.277 --> 13:56.670
You're a bastard.

13:57.612 --> 14:00.173
- You go to tank school?
- Tank school? No.

14:00.991 --> 14:05.061
I've never even seen the inside of a tank.
I'm a clerk typist.

14:05.161 --> 14:10.233
Was heading to Fifth Corps HQ, they pulled
me off the truck. They sent me here.

14:11.626 --> 14:14.229
- It's got to be a mistake.
- Mistake?

14:14.713 --> 14:18.241
Army don't make mistakes.
It wouldn't do.

14:18.341 --> 14:20.110
You from Missouri?

14:21.511 --> 14:22.496
No.

14:22.596 --> 14:25.290
- Are you from Chicago?
- You from Arkansas, ain't you?

14:25.390 --> 14:26.791
- No, I'm from Pittsburgh...
- Hey, hush up, man.

14:26.891 --> 14:28.993
Nobody gives a fuck where you from.

14:31.396 --> 14:32.831
Are you a praying man?

14:34.107 --> 14:35.375
I go to church.

14:36.234 --> 14:39.429
Which denomination are you?
Episcopalian?

14:40.238 --> 14:44.317
- Yeah, you are. You're a Mainliner, ain't you?
- Yeah. I am.

14:44.618 --> 14:46.285
Are you saved?

14:47.037 --> 14:48.530
I'm baptized.

14:48.663 --> 14:50.941
- That ain't what I asked you.
- That ain't what he asked you.

14:51.041 --> 14:52.734
- Gordo, what'd I ask him?
- See, you got to listen.

14:52.834 --> 14:54.144
- Say it again.
- "Are you saved?"

14:57.547 --> 14:59.315
Wait until you see it.

15:00.216 --> 15:01.768
See what?

15:04.429 --> 15:06.614
What a man can do to another man.

15:08.683 --> 15:12.295
Before you find Jesus, why don't
you come take a look at your seat?

15:12.395 --> 15:14.256
That's where you're gonna be.

15:14.356 --> 15:18.084
Get a bucket of hot water from
the kitchen. Get that shit clean.

16:30.265 --> 16:32.883
Oh, fuck.

16:34.686 --> 16:35.787
Fuck.

16:38.231 --> 16:40.383
Weren't supposed to be
no more Tigers, Don.

16:40.483 --> 16:41.885
Tell my platoon that.

16:41.985 --> 16:46.589
You send five tanks out. One comes back.
It's hard to believe we're winning the war.

16:53.496 --> 16:58.101
Stop talking about yesterday's fight.
Think about today's.

17:35.830 --> 17:38.708
- Straighten out!
- Hey! What's an SS doing here?

17:40.335 --> 17:43.446
Hey, why are you bringing him
through here? Why isn't he sleeping?

17:43.546 --> 17:45.523
G2 wants a prisoner to question.

17:45.966 --> 17:48.717
I'll question him.
What's your favorite color?

17:48.817 --> 17:51.037
Are you a good dancer?
Do you like fat girls?

17:51.137 --> 17:52.956
- Get back!
- Beat his ass!

17:53.056 --> 17:54.657
Stop! Stop it!

17:56.309 --> 17:57.794
- Fucker!
- Fuck him up, Don!

17:57.894 --> 18:01.881
- Motherfucker!
- Get the fuck... Get back!

18:02.357 --> 18:04.334
- Go!
- Fucking tankers.

18:04.484 --> 18:07.304
It's me, it's me. You got MPs everywhere.
You got to stop now.

18:07.404 --> 18:09.697
- Just stop.
- I spilled my fucking coffee.

18:09.823 --> 18:11.174
- Cocksuckers.
- Come on, Grady.

18:11.449 --> 18:13.051
Fucking SS.

18:13.159 --> 18:16.137
- You good, Top?
- Bring him through this camp...

18:18.164 --> 18:20.775
You see that? He's an SS.

18:20.875 --> 18:23.069
You kill every last one you can.
They're real assholes.

18:23.169 --> 18:25.188
Fuck every last one. They started it.

18:25.422 --> 18:26.740
- We finishing it.
- That's it.

18:26.840 --> 18:29.701
- Done much killing?
- No.

18:29.801 --> 18:30.869
You will.

18:30.969 --> 18:32.996
- Boys, take him through that gun.
- Roger.

18:33.096 --> 18:36.124
- What do I do with this?
- "What..." Shut up. Take a look at it.

18:36.224 --> 18:37.334
- See that cover?
- Yeah.

18:37.434 --> 18:38.535
Open it.

18:38.727 --> 18:41.371
And now you killing. Close it up.

18:41.730 --> 18:43.123
Now you ain't.

18:46.192 --> 18:51.014
Main unit's punching east. We are
going north on a flank guard mission.

18:51.114 --> 18:54.059
We'll tie up with Baker Company
from the 41st.

18:54.159 --> 18:56.353
Sergeant Collier's with us now.

18:56.453 --> 18:59.356
- He'll be acting platoon sergeant.
- Fine by me.

18:59.456 --> 19:01.433
Good to have you, Don.

19:06.588 --> 19:10.817
We're meeting Baker Company here.
Then, together we'll take this town.

19:11.635 --> 19:14.538
After that, we're working
for Captain Waggoner.

19:14.638 --> 19:17.574
- Any questions?
- I got one question.

19:17.807 --> 19:21.419
- Peterson?
- I'm Binkowski, sir.

19:23.188 --> 19:25.123
You start shaving your face?

19:29.236 --> 19:32.655
First Platoon, mount up! Move out!

19:38.620 --> 19:41.122
War's not going anywhere, sir.

19:44.834 --> 19:47.520
You heard him. Mount up!

20:06.856 --> 20:08.091
Hey!

20:08.191 --> 20:09.759
Go fuck yourself, Wardaddy!

20:09.859 --> 20:13.112
- Coffee's too hot.
- Still owe me 40 bucks!

20:13.280 --> 20:14.689
What'd he say?

20:14.948 --> 20:16.600
Mount up! Let's go, gents.

20:16.700 --> 20:19.386
- Move front!
- Motherfucker.

20:22.038 --> 20:24.307
- Okay, guns ready.
- Good luck, gentlemen!

20:44.436 --> 20:46.755
All right, there might be a wolf
hiding in the sheep.

20:46.855 --> 20:48.998
Kid, you're up. Cast an eyeball on them.

20:49.190 --> 20:51.468
<i>Anything that makes a move,
you cut them right in half.</i>

20:51.568 --> 20:54.946
People are in the way, that's their problem.
You do what you got to do, copy?

20:55.405 --> 20:57.298
<i>- Copy.</i>
- You copy?

20:58.742 --> 21:00.051
I copy.

21:00.952 --> 21:03.847
- Gordo, talk him through that gun again.
- <i>Roger.</i>

21:04.080 --> 21:06.141
Hey, gun's ready. Just pull the trigger.

21:06.416 --> 21:09.652
Every five rounds is a tracer so
you can see what you're hitting.

21:09.753 --> 21:14.774
And remember, short bursts.
That way you harvest more meat per bullet.

21:19.146 --> 21:21.197
The Americans are over there

21:22.232 --> 21:23.725
Keep moving

21:25.338 --> 21:26.885
The Americans are over there

21:27.879 --> 21:29.472
Keep your hands up

21:30.913 --> 21:32.537
Keep moving

21:59.970 --> 22:02.155
She'll let you fuck her
for a chocolate bar.

22:02.722 --> 22:05.533
- That's not true.
- It's not true?

22:05.642 --> 22:08.328
- No.
- Okay. It's not true.

22:08.603 --> 22:10.288
It's completely fucking true.

22:10.563 --> 22:11.756
<i>Or just give her some smokes.</i>

22:11.856 --> 22:13.842
You ain't got to fuck around
and give her a whole pack, neither.

22:13.942 --> 22:15.677
- Norman, ignore him.
- Fucking four will do it.

22:15.777 --> 22:19.172
Don't disappoint Christ, now.
Don't let them lead you astray.

22:19.698 --> 22:21.558
You see, we can kill them,
but we can't fuck them,

22:21.658 --> 22:23.134
<i>'cause it says so in the Bible.</i>

22:23.326 --> 22:24.561
Stop, all right?

22:24.661 --> 22:28.231
I'm done trying to convert you heathens.
You mind if I continue invading Germany?

22:28.331 --> 22:30.567
Boyd, do you think Jesus loves Hitler?

22:30.667 --> 22:34.721
Do I think Jesus loves Hitler?
I'd assume so.

22:34.879 --> 22:37.741
If Hitler accepted Jesus into his heart
and got baptized, he'd be saved.

22:37.841 --> 22:39.451
It ain't gonna save him
from man's justice.

22:39.551 --> 22:41.244
What about your regular-issue
Nazi line trooper?

22:41.344 --> 22:43.246
- No, I'm not gonna do this with you.
- Is he going to Heaven?

22:43.346 --> 22:45.123
We've been talking about the
same dumb shit for three years.

22:45.223 --> 22:47.083
You know how I stand on it.
You trying to rile me up now.

22:47.183 --> 22:49.669
Hey, what about me, huh?
You think you could save me?

22:49.769 --> 22:50.921
<i>Sing me a hymn?</i>

22:51.021 --> 22:53.340
- Yeah, sure.
- Sing <i>Old Rugged Cross.</i>

22:53.440 --> 22:54.424
I like the way your mouth
moves when you sing.

22:54.524 --> 22:55.550
- Don't.
- I like it.

22:55.650 --> 22:57.886
- I'll sing it if you don't do that.
- Let me just touch your mustache.

22:57.986 --> 22:59.554
- Don't touch me. Stop!
- I just wanna touch your mustache.

22:59.654 --> 23:01.473
Why does that bother you so much
when I touch your mustache?

23:01.573 --> 23:03.308
- I'll shoot you, I swear!
- All right, knock it off.

23:03.408 --> 23:04.884
Knock off the horseplay.

23:08.288 --> 23:11.641
Boyd, do you think Hitler'd fuck
one of us for a chocolate bar?

23:13.043 --> 23:14.686
I hope so.

24:03.426 --> 24:04.736
Ambush! Right!

24:04.886 --> 24:06.154
Right side, ambush!

24:06.930 --> 24:08.957
Fuck! Grady!

24:09.057 --> 24:11.785
You watch that tree line!
We're ripe for an ambush!

24:12.602 --> 24:13.953
Grady, cover right!

24:18.858 --> 24:20.043
Father!

24:27.909 --> 24:30.970
- What'd you see, Boyd?
- Just go out and blast them little fuckers!

24:31.288 --> 24:34.140
- What'd you see?
- I didn't see nothing.

24:57.564 --> 24:58.707
Norman!

24:59.858 --> 25:02.010
You cocksucker.
Why didn't you take the shot?

25:02.110 --> 25:05.588
He was just a kid. I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry, Sergeant.

25:06.698 --> 25:08.675
You see what a kid can do?

25:09.326 --> 25:13.680
Look! That's your fault.
That's your fucking fault.

25:13.872 --> 25:16.441
Next German you see with a weapon,
you rake the dog shit out of him.

25:16.541 --> 25:18.485
I don't care if it's a baby
with a butter knife in one hand

25:18.585 --> 25:20.979
- and mama's titty in the other. You chop him up!
- Yes, Sergeant!

25:25.550 --> 25:26.693
- Bible?
- Yeah?

25:37.437 --> 25:39.789
All tanks, Wardaddy.

25:41.399 --> 25:43.168
Looks like I'm it.

25:45.695 --> 25:47.964
I'll lead the column.
Let's get us where we're going.

26:01.169 --> 26:03.363
We have this thing set
up and on the way.

26:03.463 --> 26:07.108
I sent over a couple men to keep contact,
and the officers have been briefed.

26:10.178 --> 26:12.196
Stop right here, Gordo.

26:14.182 --> 26:16.242
- Baker Company?
- Yes, sir!

26:16.643 --> 26:19.395
- I'm not a sir.
- Me, neither.

26:19.562 --> 26:20.914
- Where's your boss?
- Dead.

26:23.066 --> 26:25.585
- Who's in charge of this column?
- I am.

26:25.685 --> 26:29.381
Good. I'm talking to the right man.
Park it over there. Old Man's waiting.

26:47.841 --> 26:49.201
Yes, thank you, sir,

26:49.301 --> 26:51.495
don't tell me how long
my casualties can last.

26:51.595 --> 26:55.332
Unless you want to come down here, stand
knee-deep in their guts and form an opinion.

26:55.432 --> 26:58.668
Baker 6 out. Pencil-pushing motherfucker.
How you doing?

26:58.768 --> 27:02.339
Load the casualties into a truck. We're gonna
drive them back to base ourselves.

27:02.439 --> 27:03.665
Take care of our own. Come with me.

27:05.442 --> 27:06.584
Hey, wake up!

27:07.444 --> 27:10.338
- All right, how many tanks we got?
- Four.

27:11.114 --> 27:12.949
Four? You're shitting me.

27:14.659 --> 27:15.844
I asked for 10.

27:16.870 --> 27:18.730
Miles! Sergeant Miles!

27:18.830 --> 27:21.057
- Yes, sir?
- Get First Platoon ready.

27:21.249 --> 27:22.859
You're working for him now.

27:22.959 --> 27:24.486
If they can stand, they're in play.

27:24.586 --> 27:26.863
- Roger.
- All right, here's the deal.

27:26.963 --> 27:29.366
I got a platoon trapped in this
beet field by machine guns.

27:29.466 --> 27:32.577
I sent my tracks in.
Jerry took them out.

27:32.677 --> 27:36.406
So, anti-tank guns there, there,
possibly there, I don't know.

27:36.640 --> 27:39.751
I need you to rescue my guys.
Take the guns out.

27:39.851 --> 27:41.494
I can do that.

27:41.728 --> 27:44.548
All right, that clears this road
into town, you push forward.

27:44.648 --> 27:46.207
I'll join you there. We'll clear it up.

27:46.816 --> 27:48.668
Maybe they'll surrender.
Or maybe they'll fight.

27:50.445 --> 27:54.716
- This high ground, you got any eyes on it?
- I had eyes there, gone. There, gone.

27:54.824 --> 27:57.669
We're flying blind. It's you and me.

27:58.453 --> 28:00.397
Krauts got sights on this road.
I don't want to show my flank.

28:00.497 --> 28:01.898
Any objection if I come in here?

28:01.998 --> 28:04.776
You can arrive on a fucking
magic carpet, for all I care.

28:04.876 --> 28:08.063
I know who you are. I know
you know what you're doing.

28:08.964 --> 28:11.158
You just paste them hard for me.

28:11.258 --> 28:14.319
They murdered some good
boys out there today.

28:17.555 --> 28:19.657
Why don't they just quit?

28:22.727 --> 28:24.287
Would you?

28:24.562 --> 28:27.174
We got a platoon pinned down
in this field by MGs.

28:27.274 --> 28:31.261
Krauts got anti-tank covering the field.
And once we cross this hedgerow,

28:31.361 --> 28:34.181
we will be in range and in their
line of sight, so be alert.

28:34.281 --> 28:37.258
- Hit anything that fucking moves.
- Yeah, unless they pound us first.

28:37.367 --> 28:39.635
If they do, we'll know
exactly where they are.

28:40.287 --> 28:42.472
Let's get these boys out of there
and smash those guns.

28:43.665 --> 28:46.526
Then we'll capture the town,
stop for the night. Clear?

28:46.626 --> 28:49.279
Why are we rescuing kittens
instead of just driving down into Berlin?

28:49.379 --> 28:51.614
- Why are you such an asshole?
- That's a great question.

28:52.215 --> 28:56.761
March order. Fury,
Old Phyllis, Lucy Sue, Murder Inc.

28:56.886 --> 28:57.987
Let's go.

28:58.555 --> 28:59.915
All right, fuck sticks.

29:00.015 --> 29:02.083
- Mount up! By squad!
- All right, mount up!

29:02.183 --> 29:03.627
<i>All tanks, comm check.</i>

29:03.727 --> 29:06.421
<i>- 1-4's up.</i>
<i>- Love 1-3 copies.</i>

29:06.521 --> 29:08.623
- That's right, man.
- Need you to hold tight!

29:20.243 --> 29:23.555
All tanks, Wardaddy. When we
hit open ground, line up on me.

29:23.747 --> 29:25.315
<i>Keep your spacing, don't bunch up.</i>

29:25.415 --> 29:28.610
<i>On my signal, we'll drop
the doughs and roll up that 75.</i>

29:28.710 --> 29:30.987
<i>- Everyone copy?</i>
- Love 1-5 copies. Wilco.

29:31.087 --> 29:33.364
- Copy.<i>
- Love 1-3 copies.</i>

29:34.883 --> 29:36.409
<i>Gordo, halt.</i>

29:37.636 --> 29:39.112
<i>All tanks halt. All tanks halt.</i>

29:47.062 --> 29:49.506
All right, let's get the boys off.
Get them off. Give me last man.

29:49.606 --> 29:50.799
- All right, ladies, you heard the man.<i>
- Button up.</i>

29:50.899 --> 29:53.677
Everybody off! Move out!
Move! Everybody off!

29:53.777 --> 29:55.545
Close your hatch.

30:02.327 --> 30:04.354
<i>All tanks, move out.
Hard right. Hard right.</i>

30:04.454 --> 30:06.514
<i>- Move them out.
- Hard right. Hard right.</i>

30:06.748 --> 30:07.983
<i>Fury's going. Let's go.</i>

30:08.083 --> 30:09.726
<i>Move, move, move, move, move.</i>

30:11.086 --> 30:13.238
Let's move now.
A hard stick right.

30:13.338 --> 30:15.824
Everybody hold yourself. Jiggs, hold on.

30:15.924 --> 30:17.409
Form in. Form in.

30:17.509 --> 30:19.661
<i>- Catch up with the Fury.
- Stick right.</i>

30:19.761 --> 30:20.745
<i>Now, catch up.</i>

30:20.845 --> 30:23.373
- On my line, guys, on my line.<i>
- More gas. More gas.</i>

30:23.473 --> 30:24.916
Mix it up.

30:25.016 --> 30:26.293
- Keep them low!<i>
- Hold your line.</i>

30:26.393 --> 30:28.161
<i>We're already drifting.</i>

30:28.311 --> 30:30.505
Binkowski, keep an eyeball
on that high ground. Right.

30:30.605 --> 30:32.465
<i>Love 1-5 copies. Wilco.</i>

30:32.732 --> 30:35.585
<i>Watch that tree line right there.
Hold that, hold that.</i>

30:42.325 --> 30:43.852
<i>- Ride on, ride on.</i>
- Hold tight.

30:43.952 --> 30:45.345
We're gonna bust through this shit.

30:45.495 --> 30:48.106
- All right, here we go, men.
<i>- Left stick, left stick. What the fuck?</i>

30:48.206 --> 30:49.858
<i>- It looks perfect, Tim.</i>
- Good?

30:49.958 --> 30:50.984
Straight on, straight on.

30:51.084 --> 30:53.445
<i>Doughs on the ground, doughs
on the ground. Keep an eye out.</i>

30:53.545 --> 30:55.071
- Straight, straight.
- Over here!

30:55.171 --> 30:57.616
<i>Gordo, slow, slow, slow.</i>

30:57.716 --> 30:59.159
We got bodies.

30:59.259 --> 31:01.286
- Stick left of me.<i>
- Eyes on the floor.</i>

31:01.386 --> 31:03.747
- Get up.
- Fall in! Fall in!

31:03.847 --> 31:05.281
Straighten it out.

31:05.724 --> 31:08.118
<i>- Watch your fucking spacing.
- You gotta left stick now.</i>

31:08.218 --> 31:11.254
All right, let's hold up.
If I say hold back, hold back. Hold back.

31:11.354 --> 31:13.089
- Left stick. Left stick. What the fuck?
- Come on!

31:13.189 --> 31:14.674
Company, clear on the right.

31:14.774 --> 31:16.918
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- Clear it up and book it.

31:18.028 --> 31:19.713
Speed up just a little bit.

31:20.280 --> 31:23.308
Love 1-3, right stick! Right stick!
You got troops on the ground.

31:23.408 --> 31:25.802
<i>Fuck, right stick!
Right stick, God damn it!</i>

31:26.411 --> 31:29.431
- Get your head out of your ass!
- They weren't fucking paying attention.

31:31.041 --> 31:32.809
Get in tight. Go!

31:36.129 --> 31:38.523
Down! Stay down! Down!

31:41.551 --> 31:42.652
What the fuck is that?

31:45.096 --> 31:46.448
Bible, hit that machine gun.

31:46.765 --> 31:48.616
Traverse left, 800!

31:49.225 --> 31:51.419
- Steady!
- On. Fire!

31:51.519 --> 31:52.704
On the way!

31:53.521 --> 31:54.873
<i>Good! Hit them! Hit them!</i>

31:58.109 --> 32:00.345
Look forward! Look at your periscope!

32:00.445 --> 32:02.714
- Bible, traverse back. On.
- Periscope!

32:02.906 --> 32:04.057
- Clear!
- Fire!

32:04.157 --> 32:05.508
On the way!

32:08.286 --> 32:09.679
<i>Cease fire. Target destroyed.</i>

32:10.914 --> 32:12.057
<i>Roger, Ester, Wilco.</i>

32:12.457 --> 32:13.600
Fire!

32:14.459 --> 32:17.187
Fuck! Anti-tank! H.E.! Traverse left.

32:18.129 --> 32:21.374
<i>- Let's go. Traverse left.</i>
- Traverse left!

32:27.889 --> 32:29.416
Just a ricochet. We're okay.

32:29.516 --> 32:31.868
Bullshit! That's a Kraut high-velocity gun.
I can hear it whistling.

32:33.103 --> 32:36.331
<i>- Anti-tank! Left front, left front!</i>
- Got it! Down 15.

32:36.648 --> 32:37.874
- Clear!<i>
- Ready!</i>

32:38.066 --> 32:39.584
- Fire!
- On the way!

32:43.405 --> 32:44.714
600.

32:45.949 --> 32:47.050
Fire!

32:47.409 --> 32:48.635
- Clear!
- On the way!

32:51.454 --> 32:53.264
Okay, cease fire, cease fire.
Target destroyed.

32:53.707 --> 32:54.849
Fire!

32:56.376 --> 32:57.852
There's another gun!
Who's got eyes on it?

32:58.295 --> 32:59.696
Does anyone see it?

33:01.172 --> 33:03.066
- Eyes up, everybody.
- Fire!

33:04.301 --> 33:05.485
I don't see shit.

33:05.844 --> 33:08.288
- Where the fuck are you at?
<i>- Anti-tank, H.E.</i>

33:08.388 --> 33:12.709
- Got it! Anti-tank, H.E. Traverse right!
- Anti-tank. Left front, left front. 600.

33:12.809 --> 33:15.328
<i>- Right stick, right stick.</i>
- On! Fire!

33:15.854 --> 33:16.955
On the way!

33:17.564 --> 33:19.124
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em.

33:22.903 --> 33:24.087
Fire!

33:30.619 --> 33:33.063
All tanks, start squirting that tree line.
Let's light them up. Let's go.

33:33.163 --> 33:35.432
- Let's clean it up.
<i>- Everybody squirt the fucking tree line.</i>

33:42.005 --> 33:43.573
Hey! Hey! Start shooting!

33:43.673 --> 33:46.651
- Well, what do I shoot at?
- The Nazis, dumb fuck!

33:54.476 --> 33:56.369
That's it. Keep their
fucking heads down.

33:58.438 --> 33:59.664
You got to reload!

34:03.693 --> 34:05.095
- Panzerfaust!
- Hey! Get him!

34:05.195 --> 34:06.838
- I'm loading the gun. I'm loading the gun.
- Hit him!

34:07.364 --> 34:08.630
Got him.

34:13.119 --> 34:16.273
- Do your job! Do what you're here for!
- I was loading the gun!

34:16.373 --> 34:18.841
<i>Machine gun, twelve o'clock!
Gordo, run those bastards over!</i>

34:23.004 --> 34:25.022
All tanks, hold here, hold here.

34:31.179 --> 34:32.889
Get your boys in the fight!

34:33.514 --> 34:36.300
Fall out! Marching fire!

34:40.230 --> 34:41.697
Come on!

34:43.733 --> 34:46.553
Hey, squirt those Krauts on the left.
Do you see them?

34:46.652 --> 34:49.054
<i>Will Actual, come in. This is Vicious.</i>

34:49.155 --> 34:51.800
<i>- Krauts in the woods to your...</i>
- All I see are dead bodies.

34:51.908 --> 34:53.601
How do you know they're dead?
Are you a doctor?

34:53.702 --> 34:54.643
- Hit them!
- But they're dead!

34:54.744 --> 34:56.179
Why would I shoot them
if they're already dead?

34:56.413 --> 34:58.356
So they don't stand up
and shoot us in the ass!

34:58.456 --> 35:00.066
- Fuck!
- Get them!

35:00.166 --> 35:01.267
Fuck!

35:01.585 --> 35:04.571
I can't fucking be
here any-fucking-more!

35:04.671 --> 35:07.824
Turn your goddamn intercom off
if you're gonna bawl like that.

35:07.924 --> 35:09.317
I got it, Top.

35:11.428 --> 35:15.573
I fucking give up. I fucking give up.
I can't be here anymore.

35:15.974 --> 35:19.277
This ain't pretty, you know.
This is what we do.

35:20.270 --> 35:22.622
- Boys, fight on foot.
- You take it.

35:28.612 --> 35:30.171
I'm okay.

36:12.989 --> 36:14.841
You're all right.

36:15.200 --> 36:18.686
Close your eyes, son. Close your
eyes, son. Do you believe in Jesus?

36:19.120 --> 36:21.330
You're all right, then.
You're all right, then.

36:21.456 --> 36:23.699
I'm gonna pray with you now.

36:25.168 --> 36:29.397
Our father, Lord in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

36:29.506 --> 36:33.702
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
on Earth as it is in Heaven.

36:33.802 --> 36:36.538
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses

36:36.638 --> 36:39.499
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

36:39.599 --> 36:42.043
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

36:42.143 --> 36:47.123
For the kingdom, the power and the glory,
forever and ever, dear Lord. Amen.

36:55.490 --> 36:59.552
I had the best bow gunner
in the entire Ninth Army in that seat.

37:01.204 --> 37:03.414
And now I got you.

37:04.874 --> 37:08.836
I promised my crew a long time ago
I'd keep them alive.

37:10.380 --> 37:14.025
- You're getting in the way of that.
- I'm sorry.

37:14.217 --> 37:18.621
Okay, I am trained to
type 60 words a minute.

37:19.222 --> 37:24.060
I am not trained to machine-gun dead bodies.
I am trying my very best.

37:25.937 --> 37:28.498
Where'd you get that U.S. Army coat?
Where'd you get it?

37:30.150 --> 37:33.378
Who'd you kill, boy?
Where did you get that coat, boy?

37:33.545 --> 37:35.171
Forgive me. Let me go, please

37:36.072 --> 37:39.175
Who did you kill? What'd you do?

37:39.509 --> 37:41.076
Don't shoot!

37:41.176 --> 37:42.103
Let me go, please, let me go

37:42.203 --> 37:43.688
- Who'd you kill, boy?
- Sergeant!

37:43.788 --> 37:45.816
- Back it up, boys!
- Hold on. Hold on!

37:45.916 --> 37:48.068
- Back it up, boys.
- Back it up, boys.

37:48.168 --> 37:51.146
Norman! Get out here!

37:57.594 --> 37:59.554
Norman, come here.

38:01.389 --> 38:03.191
Come on, son.

38:16.112 --> 38:17.848
- I can't hear you.
- Wait.

38:17.948 --> 38:20.008
Sergeant. Call your dogs off.

38:21.968 --> 38:23.802
I have a family

38:24.053 --> 38:25.887
This is my wife, my children

38:26.265 --> 38:27.556
Shut your mouth

38:31.394 --> 38:32.561
Kneel

38:41.221 --> 38:44.574
You are no goddamn good to me
unless you can kill Krauts.

38:45.767 --> 38:48.078
Put a big fat hole in his back.

38:49.813 --> 38:52.499
Put a big fat hole in his fucking back.

38:54.693 --> 38:56.169
No.

38:56.278 --> 38:57.953
Why the hell not?

38:59.114 --> 39:00.256
It's not right.

39:01.908 --> 39:06.396
"Not right"? We're not here for right
and wrong. We're here to kill them.

39:06.997 --> 39:09.516
Why are you here?
You're here to kill him.

39:10.333 --> 39:11.976
You know why he's here?

39:12.586 --> 39:14.738
He's here to kill you.

39:14.838 --> 39:17.708
He's here to kill you, Norman. He's here
to rip your throat out with a bullet.

39:17.808 --> 39:19.317
Go to hell.

39:27.392 --> 39:29.285
I'm trying to teach you something.

39:30.520 --> 39:32.088
You here to get me killed?

39:32.188 --> 39:33.465
- No.
- You gonna get me killed?

39:33.565 --> 39:36.092
- No.
- I need you to perform.

39:38.612 --> 39:40.931
Just get it over with.
Just get it over with.

39:41.031 --> 39:43.767
- I can't do it.
- Yes, you can. I know you can.

39:43.867 --> 39:47.512
He kills you, or you kill him.
Simple math.

39:47.787 --> 39:49.222
You or him. Pick.

39:50.206 --> 39:51.441
- Just kill me.
- Come here.

39:51.541 --> 39:56.312
Kill me! Kill me! Kill me!
Kill me! Please!

39:56.880 --> 39:58.314
I can't do it!

40:04.804 --> 40:06.322
Fucking stop!

40:07.223 --> 40:09.100
Please stop.

40:10.226 --> 40:12.620
Oh, no, no. This is the easy part.

40:12.896 --> 40:14.330
What the hell?

40:14.731 --> 40:17.801
- All right.
- Fuck. Please don't make me do this.

40:17.901 --> 40:19.252
Don't make me do this.

40:20.403 --> 40:23.965
It's all right. One, two...

40:26.451 --> 40:29.846
Do it, Norman. Do it, Norman.

40:31.957 --> 40:33.266
Do it, Norman.

40:41.967 --> 40:43.526
Do your job.

40:43.635 --> 40:45.362
Waddell, where you at?

40:53.395 --> 40:54.871
- Waddell!
- Move it!

40:55.480 --> 40:56.956
Move it!

41:09.411 --> 41:11.596
Come on, Norman.

41:12.497 --> 41:14.057
Let's go.

41:30.432 --> 41:32.934
Is this supposed to
make a man out of me?

41:33.435 --> 41:36.588
Is this supposed to make a man out of me?
'Cause my conscience is...

41:36.688 --> 41:40.066
- Sit down.
- It's clean. My conscience is clean.

41:40.317 --> 41:42.293
I'm keeping it that way.

41:42.736 --> 41:44.779
Look right here. Hot coffee.

41:45.655 --> 41:46.965
Norman?

42:00.170 --> 42:05.766
Don might be crazier than a
shithouse rat, but he's solid.

42:08.011 --> 42:10.488
We've been together since before Africa.

42:10.764 --> 42:13.199
I won't fight with anybody else.

42:13.516 --> 42:15.035
Me, neither.

42:15.518 --> 42:18.830
There ain't no crew stayed
together like we have, Norman.

42:19.564 --> 42:21.291
That's 'cause of him.

42:25.695 --> 42:29.632
First time we got shot at,
down in North Africa,

42:30.825 --> 42:33.470
Don, he done shit his drawers full.

42:33.995 --> 42:36.606
He stunk the tank up real loud.

42:36.706 --> 42:38.266
It's true.

42:43.672 --> 42:45.740
We move out in 15.

42:49.052 --> 42:50.903
Norman.

42:51.596 --> 42:55.692
I haven't seen you eat anything all day.
Make sure you get something to eat.

43:00.897 --> 43:03.399
You best go eat something.

43:04.734 --> 43:07.278
Make sure he sees it, too.

43:41.938 --> 43:45.733
There you go, boys. Keep pounding them.

44:28.360 --> 44:32.339
They got signs around their necks.
What do them signs say?

44:32.822 --> 44:36.768
"I'm a coward and refused
to fight for the German people."

44:36.868 --> 44:38.436
The SS does that.

44:38.536 --> 44:42.640
Let them rip themselves
to pieces, huh? Fuck them.

44:49.381 --> 44:53.660
<i>Baker 6. Love 1-6. I got eyes on the town.
We're ready to commence assault.</i>

44:53.760 --> 44:56.246
<i>Baker 6 copies. Initiate your attack.</i>

44:56.346 --> 44:59.616
<i>Me and my boys will hit them
from the south. Over and out.</i>

44:59.933 --> 45:02.419
<i>We'll split up here.
1-4, 1-3, you take left.</i>

45:02.519 --> 45:05.088
<i>Binkowski, you follow me,
and stay off my ass.</i>

45:05.188 --> 45:06.256
Check the hotel.

45:06.356 --> 45:08.124
- Come back.<i>
- Copy. I got you, Daddy.</i>

45:16.658 --> 45:17.759
Clear the alley!

45:20.829 --> 45:23.039
Keep moving, Tex.

45:23.582 --> 45:24.683
<i>Go.</i>

45:25.333 --> 45:27.110
<i>Gordo, just punch through
that wall of smoke.</i>

45:27.210 --> 45:28.278
<i>Copy.</i>

45:28.378 --> 45:31.798
Okay, hard left.
Nine o'clock, nine o'clock.

45:59.034 --> 46:00.585
Move up.

46:03.163 --> 46:06.332
<i>- Gordo, halt, halt.</i>
- All right, hold here.

46:09.402 --> 46:10.594
Grandpa

46:10.694 --> 46:12.439
Where are the German soldiers?

46:14.174 --> 46:15.200
Sniper!

46:15.300 --> 46:16.326
Cover!

46:16.426 --> 46:17.861
Get down!

46:18.094 --> 46:19.495
Bible, follow my burst.

46:24.476 --> 46:25.660
On the way!

46:39.783 --> 46:41.259
Keep firing on that window!

46:45.080 --> 46:46.473
Come on! Move up!

46:47.916 --> 46:49.067
Go!

46:49.167 --> 46:50.518
Keep moving.

46:55.590 --> 46:56.983
Keep moving.

46:57.717 --> 47:00.970
Come on, keep moving up.
Watch that doorway. Watch that doorway.

47:05.976 --> 47:07.410
<i>Halt, halt, Gordo, halt.</i>

47:08.728 --> 47:11.882
Binkowski, see that Kraut stinger in the
cellar on my left? Mind giving him what for?

47:11.982 --> 47:14.084
I'm gonna slap him around
a little bit for you.

47:14.234 --> 47:15.585
<i>Button up.</i>

47:19.072 --> 47:20.256
Hit him!

47:22.701 --> 47:23.968
Fuck you, Jerry!

47:25.870 --> 47:27.763
God damn.

47:36.840 --> 47:38.841
All right, Gordo, forward.

47:39.342 --> 47:41.611
Fucking eyes up, everywhere we go.

47:43.805 --> 47:46.041
<i>Gordo, hard right,
three o'clock into the square.</i>

47:46.141 --> 47:48.376
<i>Binkowski, you take the far end.
You cover our tail.</i>

47:48.476 --> 47:49.703
<i>Gotcha.</i>

48:05.201 --> 48:06.928
Anti-tank. Traverse left.

48:07.537 --> 48:09.431
<i>Throw some Willy Pete
in that ground floor.</i>

48:10.415 --> 48:11.558
Clear, Boyd.

48:12.876 --> 48:14.019
<i>Fire when ready.</i>

48:25.305 --> 48:27.407
No, they cooking. Go, go.

48:42.447 --> 48:44.382
Good shooting, kid.
Keep stacking them up.

48:44.783 --> 48:46.718
You should've let them burn.

48:54.751 --> 48:55.894
All right, look inside.

48:57.045 --> 48:58.855
Check the doorways, y'all.

49:00.215 --> 49:01.941
<i>Gordo, halt here.</i>

49:03.318 --> 49:05.736
Please stop shooting!

49:06.529 --> 49:07.529
Come here

49:07.698 --> 49:10.074
The soldiers want to surrender

49:11.001 --> 49:12.826
We give up

49:13.037 --> 49:14.661
The war is over

49:14.939 --> 49:16.622
Thank God

49:16.823 --> 49:18.685
Tell them to come out

49:18.785 --> 49:21.210
with their hands up

49:22.153 --> 49:24.256
Binkowski, load an H.E. and get
ready to put it in that bank

49:24.356 --> 49:27.467
- if these people want to test us.
- It's my pleasure.

49:29.035 --> 49:30.220
Check the door, check the door.

49:32.497 --> 49:34.674
Fuck, it's a bunch of kids.

49:35.125 --> 49:37.894
Cut him down! Separate them.

49:38.878 --> 49:39.905
Come on.

49:40.005 --> 49:42.524
<i>Here they come. Keep an eye out.</i>

49:42.966 --> 49:45.118
- Right over there!
- Let's go!

49:45.218 --> 49:47.237
- Go. Go.
- Fuck.

49:52.726 --> 49:54.911
Why you looking so sour, Kraut?
What you got?

49:55.270 --> 49:56.671
You. You.

49:56.771 --> 49:57.914
Burgermeister.

49:58.298 --> 50:00.305
Is he the one hanging kids?

50:02.277 --> 50:04.387
Hey. Shoot that guy.

50:04.487 --> 50:05.722
- This guy?
- Yeah, him.

50:05.822 --> 50:08.258
The SS cocksucker with the busted wing.

50:10.869 --> 50:13.430
Hey, Angel. This one's yours.

50:14.205 --> 50:16.599
<i>Auf Wiedersehen,</i> asshole.

50:17.292 --> 50:18.977
Motherfucker.

50:39.522 --> 50:42.046
Hey, you! You're real pretty.

50:42.234 --> 50:44.169
Yo, what the fuck are you doing?

50:45.237 --> 50:47.305
- I'm gonna take care of you, okay?
- Okay.

50:47.405 --> 50:50.475
- You want to see the tank?
- Hey, I'm gonna marry this girl.

50:50.575 --> 50:52.769
It's gonna be for two.
Gonna be him, then me.

50:52.869 --> 50:54.354
All right, you go on up there.

50:54.454 --> 50:56.330
- That's it. Yeah.
- Give me your hand.

50:56.790 --> 50:58.224
You boys all come through okay?

50:58.541 --> 51:00.443
- Just a walk in the park.
- All right, Sergeant.

51:00.543 --> 51:03.280
You get some rest and relax.
We'll go win the war in the morning.

51:03.380 --> 51:04.481
Yes, sir.

51:19.562 --> 51:20.955
Norman.

51:24.276 --> 51:26.778
It wasn't nothing, right?

51:27.696 --> 51:28.880
Come again, Sergeant?

51:29.406 --> 51:32.809
Rubbing out those Heinies.
You splashed them real good.

51:32.909 --> 51:34.844
Wasn't nothing, right?

51:36.746 --> 51:38.748
Sure, Sergeant.

51:39.749 --> 51:41.476
Yeah, it wasn't nothing.

51:42.419 --> 51:44.921
Fact, I kind of liked it.

51:49.259 --> 51:50.694
I want to show you something.

52:17.287 --> 52:19.389
They knew we were coming.

52:23.001 --> 52:26.187
So they got drunk as lords
and they shot themselves at sunup.

52:27.797 --> 52:30.425
Why are you showing me this?

52:34.471 --> 52:38.741
Ideals are peaceful.
History is violent.

53:02.749 --> 53:04.601
Do what I tell you.

53:05.877 --> 53:09.064
You do that,
you'll make it through this thing.

53:17.847 --> 53:18.948
Come on.

53:51.264 --> 53:53.108
Who is inside?

53:53.208 --> 53:55.192
Just me

53:56.695 --> 53:57.995
Bullshit

54:11.151 --> 54:13.086
Watch her.

54:31.438 --> 54:32.855
Come out!

54:33.773 --> 54:35.024
Right now!

54:35.508 --> 54:37.027
Hey! Hey!

54:37.886 --> 54:41.156
Come on. Calm down.
Stand fucking here.

54:41.306 --> 54:45.084
Close the door and lock it.
Lock the fucking door.

54:48.747 --> 54:50.373
You said no one was here

54:51.550 --> 54:53.541
You could have gotten her killed

54:53.778 --> 54:55.586
She's my cousin

54:56.288 --> 54:58.756
I'm sorry. Please

54:58.933 --> 55:01.842
- I was scared
- Sit down

55:32.749 --> 55:34.625
Bring me hot water

55:38.738 --> 55:40.038
Go

55:54.379 --> 55:55.605
Put the gun down.

55:57.007 --> 55:59.300
Grab a seat. You make me nervous.

56:01.986 --> 56:03.112
Come here

56:37.723 --> 56:40.083
What's your name, young lady?

56:45.388 --> 56:47.115
Emma.

57:33.186 --> 57:34.579
Hey.

58:00.797 --> 58:02.816
Fuck! Grenade!

58:07.971 --> 58:11.408
Get away from that window
before they shoot the hell out of you.

58:15.937 --> 58:18.689
Yeah! How was it, Gor?

58:19.524 --> 58:21.001
It was good.

58:21.860 --> 58:23.178
You get your ass up there, Boyd.

58:23.278 --> 58:25.463
- I hope you get scabies.
- Shit.

01:00:03.211 --> 01:00:04.688
She's a good, clean girl.

01:00:07.007 --> 01:00:09.651
If you don't take her in
that bedroom, I will.

01:00:24.182 --> 01:00:25.641
No

01:00:27.494 --> 01:00:29.878
They're young

01:00:31.056 --> 01:00:33.691
and they're alive

01:01:24.834 --> 01:01:27.729
Can I see your hand?
Can I see your hand?

01:01:30.215 --> 01:01:31.566
I'm not gonna bite you. This hand.

01:01:32.175 --> 01:01:33.443
Yeah.

01:01:34.469 --> 01:01:39.265
Now, you can tell a lot about a person
from the lines on their hand.

01:01:42.143 --> 01:01:45.254
You don't know what I'm saying, do you?

01:01:46.606 --> 01:01:48.500
All right, this, you see that?

01:01:49.943 --> 01:01:52.370
That's the Ring of Solomon.

01:01:52.529 --> 01:01:55.599
It means you help people,
you understand them.

01:01:55.699 --> 01:01:57.467
It's really rare.

01:01:58.493 --> 01:02:01.638
Really rare. You see?
You see that, though?

01:02:02.289 --> 01:02:03.473
Yeah, I got it, too.

01:02:06.543 --> 01:02:09.145
My grandma taught me how to do this.

01:02:09.838 --> 01:02:14.401
You see this right here?
That is your heart line.

01:02:17.053 --> 01:02:19.213
From the looks of this,

01:02:19.556 --> 01:02:24.202
you are going to have one
great love in your life.

01:03:47.352 --> 01:03:49.662
You don't have to say a word.

01:04:17.507 --> 01:04:19.025
Sit down.

01:04:20.802 --> 01:04:21.945
Thank you.

01:04:24.389 --> 01:04:25.615
What's that?

01:04:28.310 --> 01:04:29.586
It's hot.

01:04:29.686 --> 01:04:31.871
- "It's hot"?
- Yeah, you just...

01:04:32.897 --> 01:04:35.300
Normie! Nor?

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:37.711
Norman, where could you be?

01:04:39.529 --> 01:04:40.630
Oh, shit.

01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:42.182
<i>Pinche,</i> Norman!

01:04:42.282 --> 01:04:44.059
- Norman? <i>
- Pinche,</i> Norman.

01:04:44.159 --> 01:04:46.219
Time for you to act the man!

01:04:46.494 --> 01:04:49.439
We got you fixed up good.
Now, look, there a special gal.

01:04:49.539 --> 01:04:51.316
She's down there and
she's waiting on you.

01:04:51.416 --> 01:04:54.194
And all you got to do is come on down.
She wide open just jump on in.

01:04:54.294 --> 01:04:57.272
Yeah, she looks a little
bit like a whore, but...

01:05:02.052 --> 01:05:05.864
- What?
- I think maybe we too late, Gor.

01:05:06.139 --> 01:05:09.284
Norman. What did you do?

01:05:10.435 --> 01:05:15.440
Norman, you sneaky snail.
What did you do?

01:05:15.982 --> 01:05:18.084
Wait a second, did you...

01:05:18.526 --> 01:05:20.003
Did you...

01:05:20.737 --> 01:05:24.174
Did you take this pretty
young thing for a roll?

01:05:24.532 --> 01:05:25.809
Yeah, you're real pretty.

01:05:25.909 --> 01:05:28.145
- Did you do that?
- What's with your lip?

01:05:28.245 --> 01:05:31.565
What's with your lip? Why it quiver?
Don't worry about me, I'm a friend.

01:05:31.665 --> 01:05:33.525
He fuck you, you fuck me.
That how it works.

01:05:33.625 --> 01:05:36.736
You got to pass the plate.
Come on, make a donation to the cause.

01:05:36.836 --> 01:05:38.655
- All right, don't touch her.
- Don't touch her?

01:05:38.755 --> 01:05:40.490
- Don't touch her.
- Don't ever fucking tell me what to do.

01:05:40.590 --> 01:05:43.160
You think you get some pussy and
now you can fucking act like a man?

01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:46.196
Anyone touches the girl,
they get their teeth kicked in.

01:05:50.350 --> 01:05:52.118
That's how it gonna be?

01:05:55.939 --> 01:05:57.207
Well, all right, then.

01:05:59.818 --> 01:06:01.419
I guess it's Norman Day, huh?

01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:07.601
Shit, Top.

01:06:09.286 --> 01:06:11.762
It's your day, Norman.

01:06:15.875 --> 01:06:17.602
You should drink that.

01:06:18.086 --> 01:06:21.606
- You best take a bite.
- You a man, right? Drink it.

01:06:24.175 --> 01:06:25.827
- Attaboy.
- You did the nasty.

01:06:25.927 --> 01:06:27.287
Drink it, there it is.

01:06:27.387 --> 01:06:28.872
Your day.

01:06:28.972 --> 01:06:30.207
There it is.

01:06:30.307 --> 01:06:32.000
- You like that?
- Don't fucking touch me.

01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:33.543
Don't touch you? You a man, right?

01:06:33.643 --> 01:06:36.413
- Get some pussy, you a man, right?
- Get your fucking hands off me.

01:06:37.397 --> 01:06:38.590
Fucking piece of shit.

01:06:38.690 --> 01:06:41.051
Watch this. How about that?
How about I just kill you, huh?

01:06:41.151 --> 01:06:42.761
How about I fucking kill you right here?

01:06:42.861 --> 01:06:45.755
- Grady? Grady?
- Fuck. Don't you fucking speak...

01:06:46.197 --> 01:06:47.307
Oh, God!

01:06:47.407 --> 01:06:50.427
- What the fuck is that? Gasoline?
- Taste like gasoline? Hey.

01:06:50.785 --> 01:06:53.430
Fucking north Georgia right there, boy.

01:06:53.538 --> 01:06:55.056
Fuckup.

01:06:56.750 --> 01:06:58.059
Donkey.

01:07:00.837 --> 01:07:02.605
Appreciate it.

01:07:03.965 --> 01:07:05.525
Look at that.

01:07:16.353 --> 01:07:18.163
Go have a seat.

01:07:24.527 --> 01:07:26.129
My beverage.

01:07:31.826 --> 01:07:33.353
That's the girl's egg.

01:07:33.453 --> 01:07:34.980
That's Gordo's egg.

01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:38.058
- That's the girl's egg.
- Then where the fuck was my egg?

01:07:44.089 --> 01:07:45.231
You want to say grace?

01:07:45.882 --> 01:07:47.275
This meal's for you.

01:07:47.717 --> 01:07:49.119
Roger.

01:07:49.219 --> 01:07:51.538
- Ready?
- Let's do it.

01:07:51.638 --> 01:07:52.739
Our father,

01:07:53.056 --> 01:07:56.534
thank you for preserving our lives another
day on Earth so we may execute your will.

01:07:57.519 --> 01:08:00.330
We love you, dear Lord. Thank you for this
meal and this wonderful company. Amen.

01:08:00.689 --> 01:08:02.165
Amen.

01:08:08.530 --> 01:08:09.798
Emma.

01:08:13.743 --> 01:08:15.845
Offer the girl her plate.

01:08:19.165 --> 01:08:20.684
There you go. Oops!

01:08:21.417 --> 01:08:22.727
Hold on.

01:08:29.968 --> 01:08:32.404
Hang on, there.
I'm gonna fix that for you.

01:08:32.970 --> 01:08:35.782
Let me just fix this for you real quick.

01:08:38.350 --> 01:08:40.203
I didn't touch her.

01:08:45.817 --> 01:08:47.702
Switch with me.

01:09:03.126 --> 01:09:05.228
Y'all were gonna eat like
kings and queens over here.

01:09:06.379 --> 01:09:08.398
And we weren't invited.

01:09:08.756 --> 01:09:11.535
I wonder why we weren't invited.

01:09:11.635 --> 01:09:13.862
Guess they too good for us.

01:09:20.727 --> 01:09:21.877
I'm enjoying my meal, boys.

01:09:21.978 --> 01:09:23.337
- Are you?
- Enjoying your meal?

01:09:23.438 --> 01:09:28.201
And as much as you want to destroy it,
you're not gonna fucking stop me.

01:09:28.318 --> 01:09:30.053
- And neither will you.
- No, sir.

01:09:30.153 --> 01:09:32.046
And neither will you.

01:09:39.496 --> 01:09:41.256
Hey, Norman.

01:09:42.165 --> 01:09:44.100
Do you like horses?

01:09:48.212 --> 01:09:49.939
Don likes horses.

01:09:51.174 --> 01:09:53.151
Ain't that right, Don?

01:09:58.348 --> 01:09:59.908
We're eating.

01:10:00.767 --> 01:10:02.827
No, we're not. I'm done.

01:10:03.144 --> 01:10:04.704
I'm fucking done eating.

01:10:14.781 --> 01:10:17.483
Hey, in France,

01:10:18.368 --> 01:10:21.270
we hit the beach right after D-Day.

01:10:22.205 --> 01:10:23.515
Right?

01:10:24.249 --> 01:10:28.394
And we had to fight through
all these fucking hedgerows.

01:10:28.795 --> 01:10:33.765
Fucking pain in the ass, right?
We finally hit open country,

01:10:33.865 --> 01:10:37.153
and we linked up with the British and the
Canadians and you know what we did?

01:10:37.554 --> 01:10:39.406
You know what we did.

01:10:39.931 --> 01:10:44.744
We trapped an entire Kraut army
pulling back into Germany.

01:10:48.356 --> 01:10:49.833
We fucked them up.

01:10:50.317 --> 01:10:53.303
- Yeah.
- Yes, we did.

01:10:53.403 --> 01:10:59.759
There was dead Krauts and horses,
busted up tanks and cars for miles.

01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:02.412
Miles.

01:11:04.164 --> 01:11:06.232
Your eyes see it,

01:11:07.083 --> 01:11:09.978
but your head can't make no sense of it.

01:11:11.671 --> 01:11:13.389
And we go in there...

01:11:17.594 --> 01:11:20.238
And for three whole days,

01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:24.042
we shoot the wounded horses.
All day long.

01:11:24.142 --> 01:11:26.995
Sunup to sundown, just shooting horses.

01:11:27.604 --> 01:11:30.206
And they were some hot summer days.

01:11:32.150 --> 01:11:34.461
I ain't never smelled
nothing like that, Top.

01:11:35.779 --> 01:11:39.141
Do you know how you kill a horse?
You pet it on the...

01:11:39.241 --> 01:11:41.268
Pet it on the forehead, no?

01:11:41.368 --> 01:11:43.937
And it becomes your friend,
it goes like this.

01:11:44.037 --> 01:11:47.682
And then you shoot it
right through the spine.

01:11:48.166 --> 01:11:50.060
And the sound of it?

01:11:50.794 --> 01:11:55.398
Those fucking screaming horses?
Do you remember that, Don?

01:11:57.676 --> 01:12:01.287
All the black clouds of flies
just buzzing around.

01:12:01.763 --> 01:12:05.241
It was like being in a giant beehive.

01:12:05.850 --> 01:12:07.660
But you weren't there.

01:12:18.071 --> 01:12:22.217
That was a real fine story.
Pleasant mealtime talk. Thank you.

01:12:22.492 --> 01:12:24.978
Thank you. Thank you.

01:12:25.078 --> 01:12:27.222
It is what happened, Don.

01:12:28.540 --> 01:12:32.277
What happened, happened.
What's gonna happen is gonna happen.

01:12:32.377 --> 01:12:34.488
Sitting here playing house
with a couple bitch Krauts

01:12:34.588 --> 01:12:37.273
- ain't gonna change a fucking thing.
- Shut the fuck up.

01:12:37.799 --> 01:12:40.402
- Why should I shut up?
- You shouldn't.

01:12:58.236 --> 01:13:00.255
I'm just drunk. I'm sorry.

01:13:15.045 --> 01:13:16.146
Where's Love 1-6?

01:13:16.546 --> 01:13:18.990
- Right here.
- The Old Man wants you.

01:13:19.090 --> 01:13:20.942
- How come?
- You got a mission.

01:13:22.928 --> 01:13:24.320
Let's go.

01:13:27.866 --> 01:13:29.324
Where are you going?

01:13:30.577 --> 01:13:32.436
To take the next town

01:13:32.696 --> 01:13:34.830
and the next and the next

01:13:35.098 --> 01:13:37.666
until you people quit

01:13:38.068 --> 01:13:39.386
Do you have a pen? I'll write you.

01:13:39.486 --> 01:13:41.930
Y'all getting married?
Is that what the fuck y'all doing?

01:13:42.030 --> 01:13:43.465
This a fucking wedding?

01:13:44.241 --> 01:13:46.551
Hurry up. There are more of them.

01:13:47.118 --> 01:13:49.137
What am I walking into?

01:13:50.205 --> 01:13:54.667
A recon plane spotted a troop
concentration moving west, here.

01:13:55.418 --> 01:13:57.729
Battalion needs you
to guard these crossroads here

01:13:58.380 --> 01:14:00.231
in this grid on the overlay.

01:14:01.132 --> 01:14:04.402
- How many troops did he see?
- I don't know.

01:14:04.928 --> 01:14:06.863
What kind of troops?

01:14:07.931 --> 01:14:10.241
They have tanks, horses, artillery?

01:14:11.226 --> 01:14:14.662
I wish I could help you.
He took fire, he got the fuck out of there.

01:14:15.146 --> 01:14:16.873
Enough to spook the Colonel.

01:14:17.899 --> 01:14:19.634
All the tanks are driving on Berlin.

01:14:19.734 --> 01:14:22.387
There's a couple of thousand cooks,
mechanics and doctors here.

01:14:22.487 --> 01:14:24.964
Those Krauts hit them,
it'll be a slaughter.

01:14:27.117 --> 01:14:28.385
All we got is you.

01:14:30.328 --> 01:14:32.397
We need you to the crossroads
fast as you can.

01:14:32.497 --> 01:14:35.317
Secure them. Don't stop for anything.
You understand?

01:14:35.417 --> 01:14:38.728
Take my gas if you have to.
If those troops get past you,

01:14:40.171 --> 01:14:42.523
they're gonna smash
into the supply train.

01:14:43.091 --> 01:14:45.101
Then the whole division's fucked.

01:14:45.719 --> 01:14:48.238
All right, sir. We're on the way.

01:14:50.056 --> 01:14:52.016
- Is that gas?
- Open it up.

01:14:52.601 --> 01:14:54.211
- Yeah, it's good.
- Okay.

01:14:54.311 --> 01:14:56.663
- Incoming!
- Grady, jump, jump, jump!

01:15:15.582 --> 01:15:17.183
Grady, you up?

01:15:27.886 --> 01:15:29.779
You good?

01:15:30.138 --> 01:15:31.623
Boys, good?

01:15:31.723 --> 01:15:32.916
Thank the Krauts for that.

01:15:33.016 --> 01:15:34.125
Binkowski?

01:15:34.225 --> 01:15:35.252
- Davis, good?
- Grady!

01:15:35.352 --> 01:15:36.619
Everybody up!

01:15:37.354 --> 01:15:38.705
You up?

01:15:40.398 --> 01:15:42.091
I'm up.

01:15:49.699 --> 01:15:52.853
All right, let's get an
aid station right there.

01:15:52.953 --> 01:15:55.397
- Check Peterson. We're gonna mount up.
- Norman!

01:15:55.497 --> 01:15:57.098
- Emma!
- I got him.

01:15:58.458 --> 01:15:59.934
Emma!

01:16:03.546 --> 01:16:05.782
- Fuck.
- Who do you think you are, huh?

01:16:05.882 --> 01:16:07.025
Jesus Christ?

01:16:08.468 --> 01:16:09.619
Fuck!

01:16:09.719 --> 01:16:13.022
You gonna raise her up, Norman?
Get your ass back on the fucking tank.

01:16:13.122 --> 01:16:14.666
- Fuck is wrong with you?
- What the fuck are you doing?

01:16:14.766 --> 01:16:16.418
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- What you gonna do?

01:16:16.518 --> 01:16:19.546
- You gonna get mad? Feel anything?
- Piece of shit!

01:16:19.646 --> 01:16:21.298
- That's it, come on! Come on.
- Fuck you!

01:16:21.398 --> 01:16:23.166
- You feel it?
- Fuck you!

01:16:23.650 --> 01:16:26.552
It's called war! You feel it?

01:16:29.739 --> 01:16:32.676
Get your fucking spindly ass
back on that fucking tank!

01:16:32.951 --> 01:16:35.470
Where the fuck you think you are?

01:16:40.041 --> 01:16:41.851
Oh, God, why?

01:16:44.004 --> 01:16:45.855
Tankers, mount up!

01:17:36.473 --> 01:17:38.233
You see that?

01:17:43.021 --> 01:17:45.582
That's an entire city on fire.

01:17:52.906 --> 01:17:55.519
I started this war
killing Germans in Africa,

01:17:55.619 --> 01:17:58.762
then France, then Belgium.
Now I'm killing Germans in Germany.

01:18:01.122 --> 01:18:02.940
It will end.

01:18:03.458 --> 01:18:05.084
Soon.

01:18:06.336 --> 01:18:09.606
But before it does,
a lot more people got to die.

01:18:49.646 --> 01:18:52.732
Fuck! Reverse hard left!
Hard left! Reverse!

01:18:54.092 --> 01:18:56.486
- Fuck!
- Back up, back up, back up! Hard left!

01:18:57.804 --> 01:18:59.748
<i>Hatches! Hatches! Back up!</i>

01:18:59.848 --> 01:19:01.708
<i>- Go, go, go!
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!</i>

01:19:01.808 --> 01:19:03.627
<i>Back up. Left stick.</i>

01:19:03.727 --> 01:19:06.295
<i>Go, go, go! Hard stick!</i>

01:19:06.563 --> 01:19:08.498
What the fuck was it?

01:19:08.732 --> 01:19:11.668
That was an 88. It's a goddamn tank.

01:19:11.943 --> 01:19:13.169
Where the fuck is it?

01:19:15.897 --> 01:19:19.476
- Tank! 12 o'clock, 800 yards.
- I see it! It's a goddamn Tiger!

01:19:19.576 --> 01:19:22.829
<i>- Put some fucking smoke in his face!</i>
- Let's go, Grady. Smoke up, Grady.

01:19:22.929 --> 01:19:24.389
- Clear!
- On the way!

01:19:26.883 --> 01:19:29.361
We have to get to the crossroads.
We got to get past them.

01:19:29.461 --> 01:19:31.238
Don, let's get the fuck out
of here! Let's go!

01:19:31.338 --> 01:19:33.990
Unless he drowns himself in a
shit-filled ditch, he's our problem.

01:19:34.090 --> 01:19:35.325
Hit that son of a bitch!

01:19:35.425 --> 01:19:37.077
- Almost up!<i>
- Light the bastard!</i>

01:19:37.177 --> 01:19:38.653
- Clear!
- On the way!

01:19:39.971 --> 01:19:41.248
Shoot that fucker!

01:19:41.348 --> 01:19:43.199
<i>Fire when ready!</i>

01:19:44.267 --> 01:19:46.244
Stop! Stop! Stop!

01:19:53.443 --> 01:19:54.835
Driver make ready

01:19:55.287 --> 01:19:56.846
Load Anti-Tank

01:19:57.948 --> 01:19:59.349
All right, all tanks, move forward!

01:19:59.449 --> 01:20:00.592
Fuck!

01:20:01.368 --> 01:20:03.228
<i>- Peterson, right flank!</i>
- Right stick.

01:20:03.328 --> 01:20:05.272
Davis, left with me, stay abreast.

01:20:05.372 --> 01:20:07.057
Let's go right at them,
let's go right at them!

01:20:07.157 --> 01:20:09.860
Gordo, left flank.
Let's bum-rush this cocksucker!

01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:12.228
<i>Right stick. Taking the right flank.</i>

01:20:15.490 --> 01:20:16.684
New target

01:20:16.784 --> 01:20:18.192
Tank on the left

01:20:19.452 --> 01:20:21.803
10 o'clock... 700 meters

01:20:23.515 --> 01:20:24.958
He's coming out.

01:20:25.158 --> 01:20:26.200
Fire!

01:20:26.810 --> 01:20:28.837
<i>- Loader, A.P, A.P.</i>
- Clear!

01:20:28.937 --> 01:20:30.538
- Hit 'em!
- On the way!

01:20:31.356 --> 01:20:32.382
<i>Commence!</i>

01:20:32.482 --> 01:20:34.751
- All right, pump him! Pump him!<i>
- Gyros on!</i>

01:20:36.570 --> 01:20:39.431
- What do you want, Top? <i>
- Loader, A.P., A.P., smash him.</i>

01:20:39.531 --> 01:20:41.091
You're clear, Boyd!

01:20:42.367 --> 01:20:45.387
A.P., 500 yards. Fire!

01:20:45.779 --> 01:20:47.397
Elevate... 600 meters

01:20:47.872 --> 01:20:49.649
- Again!
- Fuck, Grady, put it in, now.

01:20:49.749 --> 01:20:51.059
- Clear!
- On the way!

01:20:56.506 --> 01:20:57.649
God!

01:20:58.049 --> 01:20:59.359
God damn it!

01:20:59.634 --> 01:21:00.944
- Fuck!<i>
- Hit 'em!</i>

01:21:01.636 --> 01:21:03.571
- Clear!
- On the way!

01:21:04.864 --> 01:21:07.075
Same target fire!

01:21:10.312 --> 01:21:11.713
They got Peterson!

01:21:11.813 --> 01:21:13.539
<i>God damn!</i>

01:21:22.365 --> 01:21:24.226
- It's a fucking beast.
- Fuck!

01:21:24.326 --> 01:21:25.927
Gordo, flank left! Left!

01:21:26.903 --> 01:21:29.773
Davis, cross him.
Flank right! Flank right!

01:21:29.873 --> 01:21:31.725
Copy! Right stick! Right stick!

01:21:32.709 --> 01:21:34.144
<i>Traverse left.</i>

01:21:34.377 --> 01:21:37.313
- Davis, he's lining up!
- Fire!

01:21:38.965 --> 01:21:40.882
Target 11 o'clock

01:21:41.134 --> 01:21:43.653
Shoot the son of a bitch!
He's lining up on Roy!

01:21:44.930 --> 01:21:46.289
<i>God damn it, I said fire!</i>

01:21:46.389 --> 01:21:47.657
Fire!

01:21:53.855 --> 01:21:56.324
- God damn it.
- Fuck!

01:21:57.634 --> 01:21:59.669
Roy's gone. We're all that's left.

01:22:00.153 --> 01:22:01.671
<i>It's up to us now.</i>

01:22:01.972 --> 01:22:03.580
Driver halt!

01:22:03.907 --> 01:22:06.059
Gordo, get around him.
Put us on his backside.

01:22:06.159 --> 01:22:08.845
<i>If we get behind him, we can kill him.
Go! Go! Go!</i>

01:22:10.313 --> 01:22:11.974
Reverse reverse!

01:22:12.074 --> 01:22:14.151
Don't let him behind us!

01:22:14.251 --> 01:22:15.685
Faster, Gordo!

01:22:18.463 --> 01:22:19.647
God damn it!

01:22:21.433 --> 01:22:23.025
Forward

01:22:25.362 --> 01:22:27.146
Target 2 o'clock!

01:22:28.932 --> 01:22:31.376
- God damn it! Fuck!
- What was that?

01:22:31.476 --> 01:22:32.711
- We got hit!
- I lost it.

01:22:32.811 --> 01:22:33.837
Boyd, are you all right?

01:22:33.937 --> 01:22:34.880
- Shit!
- Fuck!

01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:36.423
We lost power traverse.
Switching to manual.

01:22:36.523 --> 01:22:37.757
Boyd, you stay in the fight!

01:22:37.857 --> 01:22:39.501
- Bible, hit him!<i>
- On the way!</i>

01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:42.262
Coming around! He's coming around!

01:22:42.362 --> 01:22:43.680
<i>Gordo, you got to outrun that gun!</i>

01:22:43.780 --> 01:22:46.216
- Oh, I got it! I got it!
- Fire!

01:22:46.992 --> 01:22:49.511
<i>Gordo, put it in third. Right stick!</i>

01:22:51.413 --> 01:22:53.607
Bible, put it up his ass,
where the armor's thin.

01:22:53.707 --> 01:22:54.816
I know where to fucking hit him!

01:22:54.916 --> 01:22:57.227
- Boyd, you're clear!
- On the way!

01:22:58.295 --> 01:23:00.947
- Shit!<i>
- God damn it, I said in the ass!</i>

01:23:01.047 --> 01:23:02.799
We're moving too fast!
It's not that fucking easy!

01:23:02.899 --> 01:23:04.117
Come on, Boyd, stay on him!

01:23:04.217 --> 01:23:06.369
Gordo, when I say back up,
you back up. Left stick.

01:23:06.469 --> 01:23:07.570
All right, all right.

01:23:08.013 --> 01:23:10.907
- Bible, stand by. I'll call the shot.
- Roger! Roger!

01:23:12.601 --> 01:23:15.704
Gordo, now! Reverse!
Reverse! Left stick!

01:23:17.939 --> 01:23:19.374
Bible, steady.

01:23:20.817 --> 01:23:22.085
<i>Steady.</i>

01:23:22.302 --> 01:23:23.553
Shoot the bastard!

01:23:23.653 --> 01:23:25.889
- Come on, Bible!
- Come on, fucking shoot him!

01:23:25.989 --> 01:23:27.257
Steady.

01:23:30.635 --> 01:23:32.053
- Now!
- On the way!

01:23:36.374 --> 01:23:38.109
Fuck! Grady, one more! One more, Grady!

01:23:38.209 --> 01:23:39.569
- Grady, Grady, Grady!
- Clear!

01:23:39.669 --> 01:23:41.479
- Again!
- On the way!

01:23:47.177 --> 01:23:48.411
Clear!

01:23:48.511 --> 01:23:50.030
- Tank destroyed.<i>
- Gordo, halt.</i>

01:23:51.389 --> 01:23:52.490
Jesus Christ.

01:23:59.397 --> 01:24:01.249
Fucking Nazi fuck!

01:24:04.152 --> 01:24:05.628
Fuck you!

01:24:34.224 --> 01:24:36.459
Radio check, Love 1-6.

01:24:37.018 --> 01:24:38.411
Yeah, boy.

01:24:39.771 --> 01:24:43.524
Radio check, Love 1-6.
Fucking handed him.

01:24:45.235 --> 01:24:47.837
- Good fucking job, Gordo.
- Radio check, Love 1-6.

01:24:49.614 --> 01:24:51.841
Radio check, Love 1-6.

01:24:55.996 --> 01:24:59.290
Radio's eighty-sixed. We're on our own.

01:25:08.925 --> 01:25:10.110
Good shot.

01:25:11.052 --> 01:25:14.698
It wasn't me. No, no,
I'm the instrument, not the hand.

01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:20.378
God didn't call us today.
You hear me, boys?

01:25:20.478 --> 01:25:22.455
What's he doing up there?

01:25:23.273 --> 01:25:25.208
Big pair of dice?

01:25:26.776 --> 01:25:29.587
Everyone else came up snake eyes but us?

01:25:29.863 --> 01:25:31.865
- Lord's protection.
- We got it, don't we, Boyd?

01:25:31.965 --> 01:25:33.758
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
- We got it.

01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:37.896
Norman mowed them fuckers down,
didn't he, too?

01:25:37.996 --> 01:25:40.565
- Good job, Norman.
- Welcome to the Army, Norm.

01:25:40.665 --> 01:25:42.225
You did good.

01:25:45.754 --> 01:25:48.898
- Best job I ever had.
- Best job I ever had.

01:25:49.299 --> 01:25:51.109
Best job I ever had.

01:25:54.387 --> 01:25:56.656
Best job I ever had.

01:25:57.349 --> 01:25:58.616
Shit.

01:26:01.019 --> 01:26:05.173
We're still open for business.
Let's head out for those crossroads,

01:26:05.273 --> 01:26:07.709
keep it out of Krauts' hands
like we've been told.

01:26:07.943 --> 01:26:11.504
There's a wave coming in.
We're the rock to break that wave.

01:26:13.783 --> 01:26:14.634
<i>Vámonos!</i>

01:26:16.618 --> 01:26:17.969
Gordo, get us out of here.

01:26:19.204 --> 01:26:20.722
Fuck it.

01:26:40.183 --> 01:26:42.127
All right, there's the crossroads.

01:26:42.227 --> 01:26:45.163
Gordo, take us up on that hill.
We can cover the whole valley from there.

01:26:54.481 --> 01:26:56.132
Grady, get down!

01:27:02.289 --> 01:27:04.107
Shit! Not another fucking Tiger!

01:27:04.207 --> 01:27:05.497
- A mine.
- Where?

01:27:05.597 --> 01:27:08.436
Settle down. It's a mine.
We hit a mine, is all.

01:27:09.504 --> 01:27:11.698
- Everybody off. Grady?
- Yeah, I'm off.

01:27:11.798 --> 01:27:13.316
Shit.

01:27:14.593 --> 01:27:15.994
How bad is it?

01:27:16.094 --> 01:27:19.414
It's broke as fuck. Busted a bogie, too.

01:27:19.514 --> 01:27:21.190
Can you fix it?

01:27:21.391 --> 01:27:23.201
Yeah, why not?

01:27:23.301 --> 01:27:25.555
<i>Ha estado pegada, no?</i>

01:27:26.314 --> 01:27:28.697
<i>'tas bien maldita, mamá.</i>

01:27:29.187 --> 01:27:31.301
<i>Necesitan unos chacos y todo.</i>

01:27:31.401 --> 01:27:33.595
All right, Norman, you and
Coon-Ass check out that building.

01:27:33.695 --> 01:27:35.972
- Get my Thompson.
- What?

01:27:36.072 --> 01:27:37.182
Go get the Thompson.

01:27:37.282 --> 01:27:38.975
- Gordo!
- Yeah?

01:27:39.075 --> 01:27:41.386
- You got that rope bag?
- Right here.

01:28:09.481 --> 01:28:13.551
You can put the gun down, Norman.
Ain't gonna do nothing.

01:28:22.202 --> 01:28:23.845
Can we go now?

01:28:26.748 --> 01:28:28.892
Norman, I'm sorry. You know?

01:28:30.794 --> 01:28:32.604
I think...

01:28:33.797 --> 01:28:36.199
I think you're a good man.

01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:38.568
It's what I think.

01:28:41.346 --> 01:28:44.749
I think maybe we ain't,
but I think you are.

01:28:44.849 --> 01:28:48.703
See, I just... I wanted
to tell you that.

01:28:50.730 --> 01:28:52.507
It's okay.

01:28:55.902 --> 01:28:57.712
Come on, let's go.

01:29:00.448 --> 01:29:02.625
- Anything?
- No, nothing.

01:29:02.742 --> 01:29:05.870
It's an aid station. They all dead.

01:29:09.824 --> 01:29:10.850
Kid.

01:29:14.254 --> 01:29:16.981
Head up top of that hill, near those trees.
You got outpost guard.

01:29:17.841 --> 01:29:19.776
Can I grab my canteen?

01:29:20.302 --> 01:29:22.654
Yeah, you can grab your canteen.

01:29:37.277 --> 01:29:38.420
Norman!

01:29:39.195 --> 01:29:41.798
Top of the hill, then work
your way from the trees.

01:32:12.557 --> 01:32:15.560
Hey! Hey!

01:32:17.787 --> 01:32:20.298
Good evening, Norman. Why aren't
you at your post? Slow down.

01:32:20.398 --> 01:32:22.425
- They're coming right now.
- Who's coming?

01:32:22.525 --> 01:32:24.961
- The Germans!
- How many?

01:32:25.195 --> 01:32:27.589
- Too many. Too many to count.
- How many?

01:32:28.198 --> 01:32:31.434
About two, maybe 300 of them.

01:32:31.534 --> 01:32:33.061
They got vehicles, too.

01:32:33.161 --> 01:32:35.021
- Tanks?
- No, no, no, just trucks.

01:32:35.121 --> 01:32:37.107
Probably a bunch of bums
looking to surrender, that's all.

01:32:37.207 --> 01:32:39.476
No. No, no, no.
They were marching, they were singing.

01:32:39.576 --> 01:32:40.527
They sounded like they wanted a fight.

01:32:40.627 --> 01:32:44.314
- What do you mean, they were singing?
- I'm telling you. Right over there.

01:32:47.259 --> 01:32:49.119
Hey, you hear that?

01:32:49.219 --> 01:32:51.913
- It's a goddamn SS battalion.
- Bullshit.

01:32:52.013 --> 01:32:53.740
Jesus Christ.

01:32:55.183 --> 01:32:57.002
- Grady, get my gun.
- Yeah.

01:32:57.102 --> 01:32:58.670
- You want to get your weapon?
- Shit.

01:32:58.770 --> 01:33:00.589
- What do you want to do?
- Let's just get our shit, all right?

01:33:00.689 --> 01:33:03.842
Look, it's about to be dark.
We just get on up out of here, huh?

01:33:03.942 --> 01:33:05.677
- Let 'em pass on through.
- Let's him them woods.

01:33:05.777 --> 01:33:08.880
Norman, go get your shit.
Go get your pack.

01:33:09.573 --> 01:33:11.299
Let's go.

01:33:12.409 --> 01:33:14.311
We never run before,
I ain't running now.

01:33:14.411 --> 01:33:16.438
- What was that?
- We're gonna fight it out.

01:33:16.538 --> 01:33:18.899
- We can't.
- I'm gonna hold this crossroad.

01:33:18.999 --> 01:33:21.818
What you mean, you're gonna hold...
The tank's busted!

01:33:21.918 --> 01:33:23.820
- The tank's fucking busted, Top!
- Hey.

01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:25.405
- Yeah, you said that.
- Top, what are you doing?

01:33:25.505 --> 01:33:26.740
What do you want to do?
You want to sit here?

01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:27.991
- I'm gonna hold this crossroad.
- You want to sit here

01:33:28.091 --> 01:33:29.075
and hold off a SS battalion...

01:33:29.175 --> 01:33:30.660
No, it's not what I want to do,
but it's what we're doing.

01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:32.704
- There's five of us...
- Get to your fighting positions! Mount up!

01:33:32.804 --> 01:33:35.957
What you mean fucking fighting positions
when we ain't got a tank? How we gonna fight?

01:33:36.057 --> 01:33:38.168
- We got a cannon!
- Don, that don't make sense!

01:33:38.268 --> 01:33:40.870
Stop! What are you doing?

01:33:55.368 --> 01:33:57.512
Get out of here. Get to that tree line.

01:34:05.086 --> 01:34:08.423
Boys, take care of yourselves.
Get to that tree line.

01:34:17.265 --> 01:34:19.025
It's all right.

01:34:22.312 --> 01:34:24.239
It's all right.

01:34:26.983 --> 01:34:28.743
It's my home.

01:34:45.585 --> 01:34:47.929
I'm staying here with you.

01:34:52.300 --> 01:34:56.204
All right. I'll need you to load.

01:34:58.431 --> 01:35:01.509
Boys, get on. It's all right.

01:35:03.186 --> 01:35:05.271
Grady, come on.

01:35:09.359 --> 01:35:10.919
We're gonna stay.

01:35:16.908 --> 01:35:18.677
What is your plan?

01:35:32.132 --> 01:35:33.683
Fuck it.

01:35:37.554 --> 01:35:39.239
Get us one of them dead Krauts.

01:36:09.601 --> 01:36:11.038
Light him up.

01:36:32.317 --> 01:36:34.136
You wanna take that kit
right there. That's it.

01:36:34.236 --> 01:36:38.006
- Go and grab it. That's it.
- All right, all right.

01:36:38.615 --> 01:36:39.599
Grease gun.

01:36:39.699 --> 01:36:41.518
- Go on, hand it to him.
- Another box.

01:36:41.618 --> 01:36:44.646
Go ahead and get it ready.
Listen, you do not waste one shot.

01:36:44.746 --> 01:36:46.022
- You hear me?
- Gordo.

01:36:46.122 --> 01:36:47.440
- Grenades.
- Ammo count.

01:36:47.540 --> 01:36:49.609
- Put that there.
- Make them count.

01:36:49.709 --> 01:36:52.154
What kind of rounds you
got up there? Norm?

01:36:52.254 --> 01:36:53.488
- I only got two.
- All right.

01:36:53.588 --> 01:36:55.231
Ready?

01:36:55.465 --> 01:36:56.775
That's it. Yeah.

01:36:58.593 --> 01:37:00.653
I'm going through ammo like water.

01:37:00.971 --> 01:37:05.375
That's four rounds of smoke,
and 23 super charge and 33 solid shot.

01:37:05.475 --> 01:37:08.495
- What you want, Top?
- Load super charge. Set the point delay.

01:37:09.187 --> 01:37:11.080
Norman, get it ready.

01:37:15.652 --> 01:37:18.029
That's it. Here we go, Boyd.

01:37:21.449 --> 01:37:23.093
Gordo, grab me that one.

01:37:28.957 --> 01:37:30.600
- Boyd.
- Thank you.

01:37:30.834 --> 01:37:32.686
Give me that can.

01:37:48.893 --> 01:37:53.123
Might as well get a little tight.
Won't be around for the hangover.

01:38:13.084 --> 01:38:15.437
God, that's better than good.

01:38:21.134 --> 01:38:22.694
Give it here.

01:38:28.099 --> 01:38:29.659
Give it here.

01:38:34.898 --> 01:38:37.792
- What you gonna do with that?
- I'm gonna drink it.

01:38:39.236 --> 01:38:42.222
I know you hate me preaching.
I know it.

01:38:42.322 --> 01:38:44.716
But what we're doing here
is a righteous act, gentlemen.

01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:46.885
You hear me, Gordo?

01:38:52.082 --> 01:38:55.726
You know, there's a Bible verse
I think about sometimes.

01:38:56.962 --> 01:38:58.938
Many times.

01:38:59.256 --> 01:39:00.815
It goes...

01:39:02.259 --> 01:39:05.520
"Then I heard the voice
of the Lord saying,

01:39:05.620 --> 01:39:09.432
"'Whom shall I send?
And who will go for us?'

01:39:19.192 --> 01:39:22.328
"And I said,

01:39:22.904 --> 01:39:24.906
"'Here am I.

01:39:26.366 --> 01:39:28.351
"'Send me.'"

01:39:34.791 --> 01:39:36.793
"'Send me.'"

01:39:38.336 --> 01:39:41.014
Book of Isaiah, Chapter Six.

01:39:49.598 --> 01:39:52.733
Yeah. Yeah, Don.

01:39:53.852 --> 01:39:56.413
That's exactly right. Oh, wow.

01:39:57.689 --> 01:39:58.790
You're something.

01:40:18.585 --> 01:40:20.795
God damn, son.

01:40:20.962 --> 01:40:24.024
You a fighting, fucking,
drinking machine, ain't you?

01:40:24.591 --> 01:40:26.776
Machine, that's it, that's his war name.

01:40:27.177 --> 01:40:28.486
That's perfect.

01:40:29.179 --> 01:40:30.822
I christen thee "Machine."

01:40:32.349 --> 01:40:33.875
- Machine!
- Machine!

01:40:33.975 --> 01:40:35.043
Machine!

01:40:35.143 --> 01:40:36.619
- Machine!
- Yeah.

01:40:38.605 --> 01:40:40.240
Machine.

01:40:43.610 --> 01:40:45.086
I love it in here.

01:40:45.695 --> 01:40:47.472
I do.

01:40:48.531 --> 01:40:51.893
- Best job I ever had.
- Best fucking job.

01:40:55.038 --> 01:40:56.598
Yeah.

01:41:05.882 --> 01:41:07.384
They're coming.

01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:16.159
No one makes a move unless I say.

01:41:16.768 --> 01:41:19.449
Come on, you cocksuckers, come on in.

01:41:44.588 --> 01:41:45.730
Come on in.

01:41:52.304 --> 01:41:53.780
Almost.

01:42:00.895 --> 01:42:02.872
Come on in. Hey, come on.

01:42:18.538 --> 01:42:19.681
Now!

01:42:23.126 --> 01:42:25.278
Like that, motherfuckers?

01:42:25.378 --> 01:42:26.738
- Clear!
- Fire!

01:42:26.838 --> 01:42:28.023
On the way!

01:42:30.342 --> 01:42:32.268
- Clear!
- On the way!

01:42:47.609 --> 01:42:50.327
Fucking Nazi. Fuck!

01:42:53.156 --> 01:42:54.599
They're running! They're running!
Traverse left!

01:42:54.699 --> 01:42:56.893
Bow gunner, squirt those
assholes running for that mill.

01:42:56.993 --> 01:42:58.870
Cut those fuckers down!

01:43:00.956 --> 01:43:02.566
Loader, four rounds of Willy Pete.

01:43:02.666 --> 01:43:04.484
Bible, put it in that building.
It's full of fucking Krauts.

01:43:04.584 --> 01:43:05.861
- Clear!
- Fire! Fire!

01:43:05.961 --> 01:43:07.228
On the way!

01:43:10.507 --> 01:43:12.225
Give me another. That was beautiful.

01:43:12.759 --> 01:43:14.778
- You clear!
- On the way!

01:43:16.346 --> 01:43:19.115
- Bow gunner, watch that left!
- Yeah, you better fucking run.

01:43:28.358 --> 01:43:29.626
Traverse right!

01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:34.306
On the way!

01:43:37.100 --> 01:43:39.186
- Bible, stay on 'em. 15 up, 15 up.
- Fire!

01:43:39.286 --> 01:43:40.720
- Clear!
- On the way!

01:43:45.041 --> 01:43:48.678
Traverse right! Doughs, two o'clock!
Give 'em a big kick in the butt!

01:43:49.504 --> 01:43:50.572
All right, I'm on them.

01:43:50.672 --> 01:43:52.515
- You're clear!
- On the way!

01:43:52.882 --> 01:43:56.344
Loader, give me another point delay.
Skip it on the ground. Bounce those fuckers!

01:43:58.013 --> 01:43:59.698
- Clear!
- On the way!

01:44:01.725 --> 01:44:02.951
Come on!

01:44:06.104 --> 01:44:07.247
Hit 'em again!

01:44:07.689 --> 01:44:08.882
Go, boys! Go, boys!

01:44:08.982 --> 01:44:11.292
Grady, Grady, Grady,
Grady, Grady, come on, now.

01:44:11.568 --> 01:44:12.803
- Clear!
- Light 'em up!

01:44:12.903 --> 01:44:14.087
On the way!

01:44:15.405 --> 01:44:17.181
Down 15. Steady.

01:44:17.449 --> 01:44:18.550
Traverse left!

01:44:20.118 --> 01:44:21.561
- You clear!
- Fire at will!

01:44:21.661 --> 01:44:22.762
On the way!

01:44:24.456 --> 01:44:26.299
That's right, burn to
the fucking ground.

01:44:30.462 --> 01:44:31.888
Machine, clock one!

01:44:37.969 --> 01:44:39.037
I'm out!

01:44:39.137 --> 01:44:41.414
- I need a new can!
- Shoot, we out! We out!

01:44:41.514 --> 01:44:44.692
Fuck. We got a case rupture.
This gun is gone.

01:44:44.809 --> 01:44:47.128
- We need more boxes of ammo!
- We got .30 on the roof.

01:44:47.228 --> 01:44:50.531
All right, we got ammo outside.
I'm gonna lay down some smokes.

01:44:51.107 --> 01:44:53.677
Gordo, on my signal, pop your hatch,
lay down some cover fire.

01:44:53.777 --> 01:44:55.011
- Okay, roger.
- Machine, you do the same.

01:44:55.111 --> 01:44:56.346
- Grab that grease gun.
- Copy.

01:44:56.446 --> 01:44:58.807
Cover right!
Bible, get ready to snatch that .30.

01:44:58.907 --> 01:45:00.091
Roger.

01:45:20.387 --> 01:45:22.105
All right, here we go.

01:45:26.351 --> 01:45:27.494
Go!

01:45:37.304 --> 01:45:39.288
They're outside the tank!
Pick them off!

01:45:44.369 --> 01:45:45.595
Come on, Boyd!

01:45:47.122 --> 01:45:48.431
Take it, Grady.

01:45:53.598 --> 01:45:54.918
<i>Chinga tu madre!</i>

01:46:05.999 --> 01:46:07.167
Move up!

01:46:07.267 --> 01:46:08.493
Button up!

01:46:28.496 --> 01:46:29.648
Quick, quick, quick!

01:46:29.748 --> 01:46:31.474
- Quick, quick, quick!
- Hurry up, Grady!

01:46:40.717 --> 01:46:43.853
- Fuck, fuck, fuck! Fuck!
- Shoot him, Bible!

01:46:59.236 --> 01:47:02.839
- Gord? Gordo?
- Grady, I need two more.

01:47:03.031 --> 01:47:05.934
- I got two left.
- They're getting cocky.

01:47:06.034 --> 01:47:08.545
Fuckers. He's hit.

01:47:09.829 --> 01:47:11.481
Damn sure ain't no good
leaking oil everywhere.

01:47:11.581 --> 01:47:13.383
So patch me up, then.

01:47:13.625 --> 01:47:15.635
Hey, take these two boxes.
Put 'em down below.

01:47:15.961 --> 01:47:17.445
Hey, Grady, come on. Keep it coming.

01:47:17.545 --> 01:47:19.722
All right. Open the other one for me.

01:47:22.801 --> 01:47:27.080
If a man loves the world,
the love of the father's not in him.

01:47:28.932 --> 01:47:30.909
For all that's in the world,

01:47:31.142 --> 01:47:35.872
lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes,
pride of life

01:47:36.439 --> 01:47:39.292
it's not of the father.
It's of the world.

01:47:40.068 --> 01:47:42.045
The world and its desires pass away.

01:47:43.113 --> 01:47:44.964
But he who does God's will
is gonna live forever.

01:47:45.073 --> 01:47:46.424
Forever.

01:47:59.045 --> 01:48:00.522
Lift it up.

01:48:05.444 --> 01:48:07.536
Swarm and kill them!

01:48:08.571 --> 01:48:12.107
Make them count!
They're all we have

01:48:33.788 --> 01:48:36.558
Save your ammo. Don't shoot
unless you see something.

01:48:37.167 --> 01:48:38.735
We can be damn sure they're
working their way behind us.

01:48:38.835 --> 01:48:40.529
- Anybody see anything?
- I see nothing.

01:48:40.629 --> 01:48:42.255
- I got nothing.
- Nothing.

01:48:42.456 --> 01:48:44.482
Advance, advance quickly

01:48:49.596 --> 01:48:50.864
Panzerfaust, four o'clock!

01:48:52.349 --> 01:48:53.491
Traverse right!

01:48:55.393 --> 01:48:57.370
- He missed!
- Hit him with the coax!

01:49:05.862 --> 01:49:07.047
Fuck!

01:49:16.331 --> 01:49:17.974
Grady. Hey.

01:49:19.542 --> 01:49:22.112
Fuck! Fuck!

01:49:22.212 --> 01:49:25.606
No. No. No.

01:49:27.384 --> 01:49:29.310
No. No.

01:49:30.595 --> 01:49:32.346
God.

01:49:33.223 --> 01:49:37.201
- Hey, Grady...
- Get up! We're still in this fight!

01:49:38.653 --> 01:49:40.563
We're still in this fight!

01:49:43.567 --> 01:49:45.869
Watch our right, watch our right.

01:49:49.322 --> 01:49:51.007
Stay on the .30. Keep hammering them.

01:50:05.630 --> 01:50:07.982
Yeah, you motherfuckers! Come on.

01:50:14.431 --> 01:50:16.557
How long can we keep this up?

01:50:17.559 --> 01:50:20.636
- Come on, keep shooting!
- Fuck, I'm out! I'm out!

01:50:20.812 --> 01:50:23.340
- I need a new can!
- That was our last belt.

01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:24.941
She's out!

01:50:26.318 --> 01:50:27.627
That's all there is.

01:50:28.445 --> 01:50:29.513
Fuck!

01:50:29.613 --> 01:50:31.848
- Fuck.
- Don't get your panties in a bunch.

01:50:31.948 --> 01:50:34.009
We still got hand weapons and the .50.

01:50:38.163 --> 01:50:39.589
Who's with me?

01:50:41.691 --> 01:50:44.226
They're running low on ammunition!

01:50:44.761 --> 01:50:47.271
Finish them!

01:50:48.031 --> 01:50:49.667
This is our land!

01:50:49.767 --> 01:50:51.233
Attention!

01:50:51.444 --> 01:50:52.526
Move out!

01:51:03.229 --> 01:51:04.981
Gordo?

01:51:06.691 --> 01:51:08.484
Machine!

01:51:44.688 --> 01:51:46.364
Where the hell are they?

01:51:48.275 --> 01:51:49.959
They're everywhere.

01:52:15.927 --> 01:52:18.863
Fuck! Fuck, I'm out!

01:52:19.389 --> 01:52:21.390
Gun's gone! I need a weapon!

01:52:21.725 --> 01:52:23.409
Bible, no!

01:52:56.593 --> 01:52:58.028
Grenade!

01:53:22.827 --> 01:53:24.846
Go! Come on!

01:53:32.545 --> 01:53:33.780
What the fuck are you doing?

01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:35.557
- Button up!
- I'm sorry!

01:53:36.466 --> 01:53:37.901
I'm sorry.

01:53:40.211 --> 01:53:41.337
Smoke grenades, now!

01:54:06.271 --> 01:54:08.598
We're going to skin you alive!

01:54:09.666 --> 01:54:13.466
Shut up and send me more pigs to kill!

01:54:20.260 --> 01:54:21.653
Fuck you!

01:54:25.348 --> 01:54:26.816
Bible, grenades!

01:54:30.895 --> 01:54:32.163
Here, take...

01:56:44.237 --> 01:56:46.306
I'm sorry, son.

01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:52.036
It's okay.

01:56:53.622 --> 01:56:55.648
What can you do?

01:57:09.512 --> 01:57:11.539
I did my best.

01:57:12.641 --> 01:57:17.019
Yeah. I know. I know.

01:57:30.116 --> 01:57:32.143
Sergeant Collier?

01:57:32.911 --> 01:57:35.096
Yeah, son?

01:57:41.753 --> 01:57:43.921
I'm scared.

01:57:46.967 --> 01:57:49.177
I'm scared, too.

01:57:58.645 --> 01:58:00.872
Oh, Jesus.

01:58:01.606 --> 01:58:04.417
Oh, fuck, I want to surrender.

01:58:06.319 --> 01:58:08.504
Please don't.

01:58:09.364 --> 01:58:12.700
- They'll hurt you real bad.
- Oh, fuck.

01:58:14.077 --> 01:58:16.629
And they'll kill you real bad.

01:58:18.582 --> 01:58:20.900
Fuck, what do I do?

01:58:22.627 --> 01:58:24.654
There's a hatch.

01:58:24.921 --> 01:58:26.748
Okay. Okay.

01:58:26.881 --> 01:58:28.950
- Do you see it?
- I see it.

01:58:29.050 --> 01:58:31.152
- You know where it is?
- I know where it is.

01:58:42.272 --> 01:58:43.665
What the fuck?

01:58:51.114 --> 01:58:52.424
Go.

02:03:23.261 --> 02:03:25.139
Easy, boy.

02:03:26.014 --> 02:03:27.449
Easy, now.

02:03:28.224 --> 02:03:30.201
One's alive!

02:03:48.119 --> 02:03:50.805
Easy. Easy, buddy.

02:03:51.081 --> 02:03:52.399
Come on.

02:03:52.499 --> 02:03:54.776
All right, there we go. Okay.

02:03:54.876 --> 02:03:59.030
- You all right? You hit? You hurt?
- I'm...

02:03:59.130 --> 02:04:01.191
You seem all right. Let me take this.

02:04:02.592 --> 02:04:04.578
We'll leave you with that.

02:04:04.678 --> 02:04:07.263
Hey, you're a hero, buddy.

02:04:07.942 --> 02:04:09.763
Do you know that?
