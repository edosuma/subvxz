WEBVTT

00:00.834 --> 00:02.436
Previously on NUMB3RS.

00:02.470 --> 00:04.738
Go!
All right, everybody.

00:04.772 --> 00:06.407
Just stay calm. Get up.

00:06.440 --> 00:09.143
John Buckley. He's pulled mostly
high-end robberies.

00:09.177 --> 00:10.478
Jewelry store heists. Bank jobs.

00:11.312 --> 00:13.047
18 hostages.

00:13.081 --> 00:15.216
We want $18 million dollars.

00:16.517 --> 00:17.185
Take the shot.

00:19.453 --> 00:20.488
Wrong bus, Eppes.

00:21.689 --> 00:22.423
I think illusion's their weapon.

00:23.224 --> 00:23.591
Put the gun down!

00:28.496 --> 00:33.167
*

00:41.442 --> 00:44.812
MAN:
All right, keep it moving.

00:44.845 --> 00:46.747
Open D!

00:46.780 --> 00:48.416
(lock buzzes)

00:52.853 --> 00:55.723
Oh. Well, well, well.

00:55.756 --> 00:57.791
Today is my lucky day.

00:57.825 --> 00:59.227
DON:
Why don't you have

00:59.260 --> 01:00.861
a seat here,
Mr. Buckley, please.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.696
Nice suit, Eppes.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.698
Wish I could say
the same about yours.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.167
Orange is my color.

01:06.200 --> 01:09.770
Six days ago, a tour bus
was hijacked in Phoenix.

01:09.803 --> 01:11.872
DAVID: They got away
with a $16 million

01:11.905 --> 01:14.508
ransom wired to the Caymans.

01:14.542 --> 01:16.444
I hope they returned the keys.

01:16.477 --> 01:17.678
Yeah, they used, uh,
electronic jammers,

01:17.711 --> 01:18.779
uh, anti-eavesdropping gear.

01:18.812 --> 01:21.149
They even took the... the cops
on a four-hour chase

01:21.182 --> 01:22.082
using a dummy bus.

01:23.717 --> 01:25.153
Sound familiar?

01:25.186 --> 01:28.456
John Buckley, aka John Maynard,

01:28.489 --> 01:29.690
aka Maynard Dash.

01:29.723 --> 01:31.525
We have, uh, real estate fraud,

01:31.559 --> 01:33.627
identity theft, bank robbery,

01:33.661 --> 01:36.797
and last year,
hijacking a tour bus.

01:36.830 --> 01:38.366
We had fun, didn't we?

01:38.399 --> 01:40.168
Oh, by the way, is that genius

01:40.201 --> 01:41.402
brother of yours
still working with you?

01:41.435 --> 01:42.603
DON:
So, these three guys

01:42.636 --> 01:44.872
that hijacked this bus
used your plan.

01:44.905 --> 01:46.374
You guys don't think
I'm in on this, do you?

01:46.407 --> 01:47.841
I'm doing seven to ten here.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.643
You think some crook is gonna

01:49.677 --> 01:51.412
take my share of 16 mil

01:51.445 --> 01:54.315
and, uh, put it in a cookie jar
until I get out?

01:54.348 --> 01:57.351
Maybe your big mouth
gave somebody some ideas.

01:57.385 --> 02:01.222
Without conversation,
it gets very lonely in here.

02:01.255 --> 02:04.758
- Who?
- You want a name?

02:04.792 --> 02:06.860
Knock a few years
off my seven to ten.

02:06.894 --> 02:08.429
How about I make sure
you do the full ride.

02:11.199 --> 02:13.934
Let's not make it
so long next time.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.203
Huh, fellas?

02:15.236 --> 02:17.805
Good seeing you.

02:17.838 --> 02:18.939
Keep up the good work, huh?

02:18.972 --> 02:21.575
(knocking)

02:21.609 --> 02:22.843
Oh, Eppes, they're
not finished.

02:24.945 --> 02:26.380
Personal prediction:

02:26.414 --> 02:28.482
next job's going to be...

02:28.516 --> 02:29.850
in L.A.

02:29.883 --> 02:31.319
Something classy.

02:32.886 --> 02:35.889
Jewelry store, maybe.

02:35.923 --> 02:37.425
Back to the palace, fellas.

02:37.458 --> 02:39.493
(door closes)

02:39.527 --> 02:40.728
Think maybe he knows something?

02:40.761 --> 02:41.795
They get away

02:41.829 --> 02:43.897
with 16 mil, they're going
to hit a jewelry store?

02:43.931 --> 02:44.932
You got to be kidding me.

02:44.965 --> 02:46.734
He's jerking us around.

02:46.767 --> 02:49.670
MAN: Here's a little something
to put a smile

02:49.703 --> 02:51.939
on your face
this Monday morning.

02:51.972 --> 02:53.741
Today's cute and cuddly segment

02:53.774 --> 02:56.744
comes to us from Big Bear,
appropriately enough.

02:56.777 --> 02:57.811
Boy, you two are in a big rush.

02:57.845 --> 03:00.214
AMITA: Yeah, we're giving
a joint lecture today

03:00.248 --> 03:02.450
on multivariate hypergeometric
distribution,

03:02.483 --> 03:04.318
and we haven't even
begun to prepare.

03:04.352 --> 03:05.686
What are you watching?

03:05.719 --> 03:07.888
Since I was two hours late
for work last Monday,

03:07.921 --> 03:09.890
I decided to wait
for the traffic report.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.892
I can punch up the Caltrans
Web site for you.

03:11.925 --> 03:12.860
That's all right.
I'm a traditionalist.

03:12.893 --> 03:14.828
I like to get my news
from a human being.

03:14.862 --> 03:17.831
Yeah, I've seen the human being
that gives this report.

03:17.865 --> 03:20.668
She makes Pamela Anderson
look like a refugee.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.403
I know,
but she reads beautifully.

03:23.837 --> 03:25.873
(laughs)
Good day, L.A.

03:25.906 --> 03:27.441
Misty Mornay here

03:27.475 --> 03:29.777
with the good,
the bad and the nasty.

03:29.810 --> 03:33.547
We've got a Sigalert
on the 405 South.

03:33.581 --> 03:36.284
It's like a drive-in
parking lot down there.

03:36.317 --> 03:38.586
No fun...
if you're in the front seat.

03:38.619 --> 03:39.720
(chuckles)

03:39.753 --> 03:42.623
Uh, sorry, folks.

03:42.656 --> 03:44.392
My producer's saying
we need to break away.

03:44.425 --> 03:47.027
- I waited 20 minutes for this?
- Philip Lynch is downtown,

03:47.060 --> 03:49.697
where police are on the scene
of a hold-up.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.265
We're going there now.

03:51.299 --> 03:52.766
Live.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.968
LYNCH: I'm here at the L.A.
Minerals & Metal Exchange,

03:55.002 --> 03:56.637
where what was a robbery

03:56.670 --> 03:58.306
has turned
into a hostage crisis.

03:58.339 --> 04:00.608
Behind me, you can see police
and SWAT digging in.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.876
It looks like
we're in for a long one.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.878
You better think about
rescheduling that lecture.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.651
(indistinct radio transmission)

04:12.920 --> 04:15.022
LAPD's got a mobile
command post set up.

04:15.055 --> 04:16.557
They're letting us take the helm

04:16.590 --> 04:18.326
since this may be connected
to Buckley's, too.

04:18.359 --> 04:20.294
- How many guys?
- Witnesses saw three men

04:20.328 --> 04:22.062
dressed as janitors
pushing a cleaning cart.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.332
They entered the building--
couple minutes later,

04:24.365 --> 04:26.934
cops responded
to a silent alarm from inside.

04:26.967 --> 04:27.935
Witnesses?

04:27.968 --> 04:30.304
General descriptions fit
our three bus hijackers.

04:30.338 --> 04:31.271
And hostages?

04:31.305 --> 04:32.540
David's looking
at security camera footage,

04:32.573 --> 04:33.607
trying to get a count.

04:37.911 --> 04:39.547
All right, what do we got?

04:39.580 --> 04:40.614
Right now, cartoons.

04:40.648 --> 04:42.650
Bad guys hacked the cameras
inside the Exchange.

04:42.683 --> 04:43.817
This is what they're
transmitting.

04:43.851 --> 04:45.052
Before the override,
cameras caught

04:45.085 --> 04:47.020
the first few minutes
of the break-in.

04:47.054 --> 04:49.590
Crew entered,
they took out the guard.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.727
Then they took control of
the main floor of the Exchange.

04:53.761 --> 04:56.330
Took away cell phones and PDAs.

04:56.364 --> 04:57.998
They ordered everyone
to the back

04:58.031 --> 04:58.866
and handed out jumpsuits

04:58.899 --> 05:01.402
and ball caps
for everyone to put on.

05:01.435 --> 05:02.636
So you can't tell the bad guys

05:02.670 --> 05:03.804
- from the hostages.
- Yeah, not that we

05:03.837 --> 05:04.905
can tell much of anything

05:04.938 --> 05:06.374
that's going on
inside there right now.

05:06.407 --> 05:08.642
They, uh, covered up
the windows,

05:08.676 --> 05:11.379
and they're using jammers to
prevent us from eavesdropping.

05:11.412 --> 05:12.946
Exactly like the bus hijacking.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.348
Using Buckley's playbook.

05:14.382 --> 05:15.916
Yeah, except for one thing.

05:15.949 --> 05:18.519
The manager hit a silent alarm.

05:18.552 --> 05:20.888
He didn't think anyone saw him.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.022
Buckley was careful
not to hurt anyone.

05:22.055 --> 05:22.956
These guys are different.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.892
Buckley said these guys
were hitting L.A.,

05:24.925 --> 05:25.993
said they would hit
a jewelry store.

05:26.026 --> 05:27.828
All right, well, it's
not exactly a jewelry store.

05:27.861 --> 05:28.762
Well, place is a clearinghouse

05:28.796 --> 05:30.130
for every diamond company
in the world.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.131
I mean, there's got to be

05:31.164 --> 05:32.533
at least $100 million in there.

05:32.566 --> 05:34.635
Yeah, along with 26 hostages.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.770
I guess Buckley wasn't

05:36.804 --> 05:38.672
jerking us around after all.

05:49.517 --> 05:52.553
(indistinct radio transmission)

05:59.960 --> 06:01.529
All right, our snipers
are moving into position.

06:01.562 --> 06:03.531
DON: How about the phones?
How we doing there?

06:03.564 --> 06:04.932
All lines have been cut,

06:04.965 --> 06:06.667
except for one
patched directly into here.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.001
Now, the security company
for the Exchange

06:08.035 --> 06:10.070
says the cameras are linked
via a network system.

06:10.103 --> 06:11.605
The bad guys hacked into that.

06:11.639 --> 06:12.806
Company doesn't know how.

06:12.840 --> 06:13.974
Our guys
can't figure it out, either.

06:14.007 --> 06:15.809
Agent Eppes,
we got a call coming in.

06:15.843 --> 06:16.777
It's a Web call

06:16.810 --> 06:18.512
from the prison library
at Terminal Island.

06:18.546 --> 06:20.080
- Can you put it up here?
- Mm-hmm.

06:20.113 --> 06:21.549
I don't have a lot of time here,

06:21.582 --> 06:22.450
Eppes, so I'm going
to make this quick.

06:22.483 --> 06:23.884
All right, Buckley,
what do you want?

06:23.917 --> 06:26.019
I've been watching the news.

06:26.053 --> 06:26.887
I tried to give you a heads-up,

06:26.920 --> 06:28.021
but you should listen
to me this time.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.156
Yeah, why is that?

06:29.189 --> 06:31.492
Your SWAT boys are getting
too close to those doors.

06:31.525 --> 06:33.193
What's your point?

06:33.226 --> 06:36.063
My point is that they may be
wired with bombs.

06:36.096 --> 06:38.666
Listen, you need me, Eppes.

06:38.699 --> 06:41.735
All I'm asking for
is a few hours on the outside.

06:41.769 --> 06:42.603
Oh.

06:42.636 --> 06:43.637
MAN: We know you're in there,
Buckley!

06:43.671 --> 06:44.638
What's going on?

06:44.672 --> 06:45.973
Librarian wants his desk back.

06:46.006 --> 06:48.676
Wait till he finds out
I deleted all his porn.

06:48.709 --> 06:51.411
There was a lot of it.
You know where to find me.

06:53.013 --> 06:55.949
Infrared scopes show plastic
explosives wired to the doors.

06:55.983 --> 06:57.751
It's tied to the building's
power supply.

06:57.785 --> 06:58.919
DON: Tell SWAT

06:58.952 --> 07:00.053
- to pull back, all right?
- We have a call coming in.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.822
- Prison library again?
- No, it's from the Exchange.

07:03.724 --> 07:05.092
This is Agent Eppes.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.226
Who's this?

07:06.259 --> 07:09.930
Your best friend
in the world right now.

07:09.963 --> 07:13.100
I see SWAT pulling back.

07:13.133 --> 07:14.902
Gives me hope
we can resolve this

07:14.935 --> 07:16.236
without anybody getting dead.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.671
I want a Gulfstream,

07:17.705 --> 07:20.674
fueled up and a bus
to take me there.

07:20.708 --> 07:22.042
2:00 p.m.

07:22.075 --> 07:25.012
For every second you're late,

07:25.045 --> 07:27.080
I kill a hostage.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.749
You've got four hours.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.619
All right, get Buckley here now.

07:31.652 --> 07:32.920
And-and I want Nikki

07:32.953 --> 07:34.121
to find Charlie
and-and figure out

07:34.154 --> 07:35.656
what's going on
with these cameras--

07:35.689 --> 07:38.191
how they got them,
and I want them back.

07:38.225 --> 07:40.961
CHARLIE: It's brilliant.
They attack the weakest point.

07:40.994 --> 07:42.530
The Internet protocol.

07:42.563 --> 07:45.098
They used a variation on
"the man in the middle" attack.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.767
The man in the middle?

07:46.800 --> 07:48.969
It's a way of hijacking
streaming data. So they hack in,

07:49.002 --> 07:50.771
they intercept the legitimate
data that's coming in

07:50.804 --> 07:51.939
from the security cameras,
and then

07:51.972 --> 07:53.006
they just replace it
with their own.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.808
- And can we get back in?
-AMITA: Well, we need

07:54.842 --> 07:56.043
to find out where they
entered the system.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.678
If we can do that,
we can restore

07:57.711 --> 07:58.979
the legitimate stream,
and that way,

07:59.012 --> 08:00.280
we can gain control
of the cameras.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.215
How long is that going to take?

08:02.249 --> 08:03.584
At least a couple of hours.

08:03.617 --> 08:04.051
We may not have that long.

08:06.086 --> 08:08.121
BUCKLEY:
Oh, Mom, Dad.

08:08.155 --> 08:10.057
(chuckles)
I've been in there so long,

08:10.090 --> 08:12.159
I barely recognize you.

08:12.192 --> 08:13.126
Especially you, Mom.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.194
Ooh.

08:14.227 --> 08:15.963
You look great.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.598
- All right, let's go.
- Is there any way

08:17.631 --> 08:19.199
- we can lose the shackles?
- No.

08:19.232 --> 08:20.901
Agent Eppes was very clear
on that.

08:20.934 --> 08:23.036
Oh, well, it's all right.

08:23.070 --> 08:25.038
Handcuffs kind of heighten
the experience anyway.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.641
I'm going to miss you

08:27.675 --> 08:29.543
most of all, Scarecrow.

08:29.577 --> 08:31.912
And you, too, Cowardly Lion.

08:31.945 --> 08:33.547
- Hey, are you done?
- Wow.

08:33.581 --> 08:35.148
You have a lot of anger issues.

08:35.182 --> 08:37.084
We've given you
what you asked for.

08:37.117 --> 08:38.852
Now it's your turn.
I want a name.

08:38.886 --> 08:40.754
I want ice cream.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.291
Banana split.

08:44.324 --> 08:47.327
Three flavors-- chocolate,
strawberry and bubble gum.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.763
(indistinct radio transmission)

08:53.266 --> 08:55.202
Wiring looks rudimentary.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.871
The detonator's running
off the existing power grid.

08:57.905 --> 08:59.306
We cut the juice
to the building,

08:59.339 --> 09:00.574
should defuse the bomb.

09:00.608 --> 09:01.609
WOMAN:
Agent Eppes?

09:01.642 --> 09:03.010
Phone call.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.945
(phone beeps)

09:04.978 --> 09:08.048
- This is Eppes.
- MAN: I see snipers.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.783
I want them gone.

09:09.817 --> 09:11.184
Let's talk about
those hostages first.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.120
I got one guy not so good.

09:13.153 --> 09:14.722
Well, you let him go,

09:14.755 --> 09:16.189
and I'll get rid of the snipers.
How's that?

09:16.223 --> 09:18.091
I'll send him out.

09:20.127 --> 09:24.297
Yeah, I got a lot
of people here.

09:24.331 --> 09:26.934
They need food and water.

09:26.967 --> 09:28.101
Done.

09:28.135 --> 09:29.202
No cold pizza.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.771
I want good stuff.

09:30.804 --> 09:34.808
Chicken dinners
from El Pollo Guapo.

09:34.842 --> 09:37.010
One cop with the delivery guys,
that's it.

09:37.044 --> 09:39.613
Don't try anything.

09:39.647 --> 09:41.114
(phone beeps)

09:41.148 --> 09:43.884
- DWP is ready to cut the power.
- All right, as soon

09:43.917 --> 09:45.252
as the hostage is clear,
pull the plug.

09:45.285 --> 09:46.987
And tell SWAT to hide
the snipers better, all right?

09:52.993 --> 09:54.895
MAN: We've got a visual
on the sick hostage.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.897
SWAT's moving in.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.131
Hostage is coming out.

09:58.165 --> 10:00.267
We've got a medical team
standing by.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.202
Just walk forward, sir.

10:02.235 --> 10:04.304
Just keep walking.

10:04.337 --> 10:07.641
(indistinct radio transmission)

10:07.675 --> 10:09.209
This way, sir.

10:10.377 --> 10:12.079
NIKKI:
Charlie and Amita

10:12.112 --> 10:13.080
were able to work some magic.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.248
AMITA: Yeah, we were able
to hack back into

10:15.282 --> 10:16.216
the IP security camera network.

10:16.249 --> 10:17.117
Mm-hmm.

10:17.150 --> 10:17.951
We're sending you
the feed right now.

10:19.086 --> 10:20.153
All right, good, guys. Thanks.

10:20.187 --> 10:22.322
And, Charlie, I need you
down here, buddy, all right?

10:22.355 --> 10:23.657
Okay.

10:25.693 --> 10:26.694
What took you so long?

10:26.727 --> 10:28.228
We had to make a detour.

10:29.196 --> 10:31.031
Mmm. Don't worry.

10:31.064 --> 10:33.667
I got you a little something
yourself.

10:33.701 --> 10:35.202
I pegged you for a vanilla guy.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.838
- Yeah, thanks.
- Fine, more for me.

10:37.871 --> 10:39.773
He's got such an attitude.

10:39.807 --> 10:41.341
Mr. Personality
I.D.'d our ringleader.

10:41.374 --> 10:42.976
Name's Len Maddux.

10:43.010 --> 10:44.678
He served time with Buckley
at Terminal Island.

10:44.712 --> 10:46.246
They shared a cell
for six weeks.

10:46.279 --> 10:48.315
Sounds like cruel
and unusual punishment to me.

10:48.348 --> 10:50.250
Yeah, Maddux got out
four months ago.

10:50.283 --> 10:52.252
Now, Buckley's verbal diarrhea
gave him the blueprint

10:52.285 --> 10:53.754
for his current crime spree.

10:53.787 --> 10:55.055
The bus hijacking,
Diamond Exchange--

10:55.088 --> 10:56.289
I mean, all of it.

10:56.323 --> 10:57.691
- You run him?
- Nikki's got it.

10:57.725 --> 10:58.692
All right.

10:58.726 --> 11:00.260
What? Can't I just sit here

11:00.293 --> 11:02.863
and enjoy it?
Why do you got to ruin my high?

11:02.896 --> 11:05.332
Oh, come on.
Be careful with that.

11:05.365 --> 11:07.067
There's still some left.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.837
NIKKI:
Len Maddux: a career criminal,

11:09.870 --> 11:11.204
convictions for carjacking,

11:11.238 --> 11:13.273
assault, armed robbery.

11:13.306 --> 11:15.208
A man who's not afraid
to use a gun.

11:15.242 --> 11:18.045
Got himself an early parole
in return for ratting out

11:18.078 --> 11:19.179
a former partner in crime.

11:19.212 --> 11:21.849
You really got your hands full
with this one, Eppes.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.784
Buckley, you've got
your work cut out for you.

11:23.817 --> 11:25.218
Now, you taught these guys
your little bag of tricks.

11:25.252 --> 11:26.353
I want to hear what you know.

11:26.386 --> 11:28.021
Let's go.

11:28.055 --> 11:29.456
Well, I assume you
already got rid

11:29.489 --> 11:31.158
of the guy
with the bad ticker.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.125
There's usually one.
Very annoying.

11:32.159 --> 11:33.193
Uh-huh.

11:33.226 --> 11:36.196
Tell me you didn't listen
to the bomb squad guys

11:36.229 --> 11:37.364
and cut the power.

11:41.268 --> 11:43.003
Congratulations.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.437
You just triggered
the fail-safe.

11:44.471 --> 11:46.740
DAVID: Whoa. You're saying
there's no way

11:46.774 --> 11:47.975
to disarm the bombs now?

11:48.008 --> 11:49.376
Yeah, that's exactly
what I'm saying.

11:49.409 --> 11:52.145
Agent Eppes, Maddux on the line.

11:54.347 --> 11:55.448
This is Eppes.

11:55.482 --> 11:57.384
(woman sobs)
MADDUX: I said no tricks,

11:57.417 --> 11:59.753
and then you go
and cut the power.

11:59.787 --> 12:00.921
Just take it easy, now, okay?

12:00.954 --> 12:02.422
It wasn't us. It was DWP.

12:02.455 --> 12:04.191
Apparently,
there was, uh, an outage.

12:05.392 --> 12:06.794
(woman whimpers)

12:07.895 --> 12:09.462
Do you think I'm an idiot?

12:11.799 --> 12:15.268
(gasps)

12:15.302 --> 12:19.840
I want the power back on now.

12:19.873 --> 12:21.909
(gun cocks, hostages gasp)

12:24.577 --> 12:27.547
An outage in the area? DWP?

12:27.580 --> 12:30.918
You got a building full of
innocent people and a wack-job

12:30.951 --> 12:32.485
holding a gun to their heads.

12:32.519 --> 12:33.854
My stock just went up.

12:33.887 --> 12:35.322
Better call the DA's office.

12:35.355 --> 12:36.924
You want me to help you
out of this mess?

12:36.957 --> 12:37.891
I want a new deal.

12:45.498 --> 12:47.334
(sighs)
DON: All right, Buckley.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.402
Heads up. Here comes your offer.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.905
(Buckley groaning)

12:51.939 --> 12:53.874
LIZ:
You serve two more years.

12:53.907 --> 12:56.209
Remainder of your sentence
gets reduced to probation.

12:56.243 --> 12:58.378
This isn't exactly
the get-out-of-jail-free card

12:58.411 --> 12:59.913
that I asked for.

12:59.947 --> 13:00.580
How about you do the full dime?

13:00.613 --> 13:02.816
Got a pen?

13:02.850 --> 13:04.151
(phone rings)

13:04.184 --> 13:05.452
Eppes.

13:05.485 --> 13:07.220
Yeah, let him through.

13:07.254 --> 13:08.588
It's Charlie.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.824
Ah, the Einstein cometh.

13:18.999 --> 13:21.601
Oh, come on!

13:21.634 --> 13:23.470
This isn't an homage.

13:23.503 --> 13:24.872
It's plagiarism.

13:24.905 --> 13:26.406
I-I'm going to sue
this guy, Maddux.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.441
Okay, let's focus
on catching them first.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.878
Okay, well, for starters,

13:30.911 --> 13:33.180
they are way too familiar
with this place.

13:33.213 --> 13:34.281
You think they had
an inside man?

13:36.449 --> 13:37.951
More like an inside chick.

13:37.985 --> 13:39.386
Someone who works
at the Exchange.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.554
Maybe someone who works
in security.

13:41.588 --> 13:43.891
At least that's how I roll.

13:43.924 --> 13:46.259
I look for a beautiful woman,

13:46.293 --> 13:48.595
someone who's very
dissatisfied with her life,

13:48.628 --> 13:50.563
- misunderstood.
- Buckley.

13:50.597 --> 13:51.932
We share each other's secrets.

13:51.965 --> 13:53.600
DON:
Buckley, focus! Come on.

13:53.633 --> 13:56.203
Sorry.

13:56.236 --> 13:58.438
Well, we know how they got in.

13:58.471 --> 14:00.473
The question is:
how are they going to get out?

14:02.242 --> 14:05.045
The art of the con
is the art of misdirection.

14:05.078 --> 14:07.114
Lesson number one:
never show your true hand.

14:07.147 --> 14:10.483
- They requested a plane, a bus.
- No, no, that is...

14:10.517 --> 14:11.584
that's all smoke and mirrors.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.420
My guess is,
Maddux is going to send

14:13.453 --> 14:15.388
the hostages out the front door,

14:15.422 --> 14:17.324
and then him and his crew
are going to escape underground.

14:17.357 --> 14:18.425
Through the sewers.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.160
Bingo, Professor.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.194
The best defense

14:21.228 --> 14:23.496
- is a good offense.
- DAVID: So you're saying

14:23.530 --> 14:25.565
we should take Maddux down
before he makes his move.

14:27.234 --> 14:28.268
What about the bombs?

14:28.301 --> 14:29.469
If they're following my plan,

14:29.502 --> 14:31.972
there's always a couple
of escape routes

14:32.005 --> 14:33.540
in case the cops breach--

14:33.573 --> 14:34.975
exit doors
that you can go out of

14:35.008 --> 14:36.509
and you know
you won't get blown up.

14:36.543 --> 14:39.146
Okay, so some of the bombs
on the doors

14:39.179 --> 14:40.981
- are probably dummies.
- So, which ones?

14:41.014 --> 14:42.082
May I?

14:42.115 --> 14:44.517
Now, in prison,

14:44.551 --> 14:47.354
we play this game on the
computer called Jeu Militaire.

14:49.522 --> 14:51.691
Each player
gets three black dots,

14:51.724 --> 14:54.527
and the computer
gets one red dot.

14:54.561 --> 14:57.097
We take turns moving around
on the grid.

14:57.130 --> 15:00.333
The object of the game
is to trap the red dot

15:00.367 --> 15:02.702
so that it has no place to move.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.104
Now, if you reverse it,

15:04.137 --> 15:05.538
and you imagine that Maddux

15:05.572 --> 15:08.075
is the red dot
and we're the black dots,

15:08.108 --> 15:10.577
Maddux is trying to find
the best escape route.

15:10.610 --> 15:13.180
What you're talking about
is combinatorial game theory.

15:13.213 --> 15:14.147
Heuristic learning.

15:14.181 --> 15:16.383
- Sounds incurable.
- Sounds like an answer.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.418
All right, so... you guys
should get to work.

15:18.451 --> 15:19.519
LIZ: I'll talk to Nikki--
we'll get started

15:19.552 --> 15:21.188
looking for an inside chick.

15:22.322 --> 15:24.024
Hold on.

15:24.057 --> 15:26.093
El Pollo Guapo?
I love this place.

15:26.126 --> 15:28.095
- These are our guys?
- Yeah, we put LAPD

15:28.128 --> 15:29.963
in the delivery guys' uniforms.

15:29.997 --> 15:31.298
BUCKLEY:
Mmm. Fantastic.

15:31.331 --> 15:32.565
Do me a favor.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.467
When you're done feeding
the multitudes here,

15:34.501 --> 15:36.469
could you get the professor
and I two mochaccinos?

15:36.503 --> 15:37.737
Oh, no, I'm okay.

15:37.770 --> 15:41.441
And a, um... chai latte
with a hint of cinnamon

15:41.474 --> 15:42.742
for the lady

15:42.775 --> 15:44.611
and, uh, black coffee
for Grumpy over there.

15:44.644 --> 15:46.613
I've got Maddux on the line.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.615
BUCKLEY:
Hey, guys, listen!

15:48.648 --> 15:51.318
If he lets you buy more time,
the airplane is a con.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.720
Him and his guys are going
to be tunneling their way out.

16:00.493 --> 16:01.461
This is Eppes.

16:01.494 --> 16:02.629
Where is my food?

16:02.662 --> 16:04.297
It's on its way.

16:04.331 --> 16:06.433
But we need a little more time
for that plane.

16:10.037 --> 16:12.105
One hour.

16:12.139 --> 16:14.074
And I want that food.

16:14.107 --> 16:16.576
All right, you better have SWAT
cover those sewer exits, right?

16:16.609 --> 16:18.178
We're talking a lot
of manpower.

16:18.211 --> 16:19.312
I-I think we know a guy.

16:21.581 --> 16:22.649
Hey.

16:22.682 --> 16:24.351
I heard Don gave you a call.

16:24.384 --> 16:25.485
Ready to go spelunking?

16:25.518 --> 16:26.753
We going to need miner's lights?

16:26.786 --> 16:28.055
No, just an outlet.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.689
My, uh, computer is dying.

16:29.722 --> 16:31.358
Ah.

16:33.826 --> 16:36.263
I hope you understand this.

16:36.296 --> 16:38.431
It's just an elaboration
on the same strategy puzzles

16:38.465 --> 16:39.699
that you did in prison.

16:39.732 --> 16:41.068
Hey, Charlie.

16:41.101 --> 16:42.235
Uh, I'm sending you

16:42.269 --> 16:43.770
the traffic flow data
you asked for.

16:43.803 --> 16:45.172
And you are...?

16:45.205 --> 16:46.773
Engaged... to me.

16:46.806 --> 16:48.408
- Really?
- Yes.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.177
- You're a lucky guy.
- Thank you.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.344
BUCKLEY:
Hello.

16:51.378 --> 16:52.412
- Okay.
- Nice.

16:52.445 --> 16:53.613
All right, we're almost there.

16:53.646 --> 16:55.282
You know,
I got to say, your, uh,

16:55.315 --> 16:56.783
Jeu Militaire idea
was inspired.

16:56.816 --> 16:58.351
I don't know
if you realize this,

16:58.385 --> 17:00.353
but you're kind of a natural
at game theory.

17:00.387 --> 17:01.321
Thank you.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.390
Math was always my best subject.

17:03.423 --> 17:05.358
- I even got a scholarship.
- AMITA: To where?

17:05.392 --> 17:06.426
MIT.

17:06.459 --> 17:08.228
M... MIT?

17:08.261 --> 17:09.562
I know. Go figure.

17:09.596 --> 17:11.598
Couple weeks
before classes started,

17:11.631 --> 17:13.233
my buddies convinced me
to go down

17:13.266 --> 17:15.368
to Costa Rica
to do a little fishing...

17:15.402 --> 17:16.503
and drug running.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.271
One of those turns

17:18.305 --> 17:19.606
you take in life, you know?

17:19.639 --> 17:21.274
But, if you guys

17:21.308 --> 17:22.609
make it to your honeymoon,

17:22.642 --> 17:25.212
I've got two words for you:

17:25.245 --> 17:27.380
Costa Rica.

17:27.414 --> 17:30.383
The most beautiful place
on Earth.

17:30.417 --> 17:32.252
- Trust me.
- AMITA: Uh, I got to get going.

17:32.285 --> 17:33.753
I'll check in later.

17:33.786 --> 17:35.255
Nice meeting you.

17:35.288 --> 17:37.257
I look forward
to going to the wedding.

17:37.290 --> 17:38.325
(chuckles)

17:41.394 --> 17:43.430
MAN: Uh, sniper two, we've got
eyes on the delivery team.

17:43.463 --> 17:45.498
They're approaching the building
at this point.

17:49.136 --> 17:50.403
Lunchtime.

17:50.437 --> 17:51.571
MAN (over radio):
Delivery team is entering.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.275
I would have ordered the fries.

17:56.776 --> 17:58.245
MAN (over radio):
All units stand by.

17:58.278 --> 18:01.181
Delivery team
has entered the building.

18:16.563 --> 18:17.864
Okay, they got their food.

18:17.897 --> 18:20.300
Now let's hope they
let them walk out of there.

18:22.902 --> 18:24.671
WOMAN: Sniper one and
sniper two, they are coming out.

18:24.704 --> 18:26.306
Keep them in your sights.

18:26.339 --> 18:28.775
MAN: Sniper one, they, uh,
seem to be coming out okay.

18:28.808 --> 18:31.344
DAVID: We have Nikki and
your dad on a videoconference.

18:31.378 --> 18:34.181
Oh, yeah.
Just put it up here for me.

18:34.214 --> 18:35.648
Hey, guys. What do you got?

18:35.682 --> 18:36.816
ALAN:
Uh, you wanted sewers.

18:36.849 --> 18:38.318
I'm giving you sewers.

18:38.351 --> 18:39.619
We're sending you a feed now.

18:41.921 --> 18:43.690
What are we looking at?

18:43.723 --> 18:45.858
You know, actually, your friend,
Mr. Buckley, is right.

18:45.892 --> 18:47.794
The sewers run
right underneath the building.

18:47.827 --> 18:49.796
So, I flagged the sewer lines

18:49.829 --> 18:51.398
that are the best candidates
for escape.

18:51.431 --> 18:53.400
NIKKI:
And the exits all surface

18:53.433 --> 18:56.303
in alleyways within a few blocks
of the Exchange.

18:56.336 --> 18:58.238
DAVID: Probably have a car
stashed nearby.

18:58.271 --> 18:59.406
Right. I mean, we could
definitely cover this.

18:59.439 --> 19:01.208
Get SWAT moving now.

19:01.241 --> 19:02.242
That's good, Dad. Thanks.

19:02.275 --> 19:03.410
Dad?

19:04.711 --> 19:06.446
How many Eppes guys you got
in the FBI?

19:06.479 --> 19:08.448
Oh, actually,
I'm an urban planner.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.550
But I do have an FBI file.

19:10.583 --> 19:11.751
Oh.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.920
Some circus
you're running over here.

19:13.953 --> 19:15.488
Next, you're going to tell me
you have

19:15.522 --> 19:16.856
another member of the family

19:16.889 --> 19:18.758
who's an astronomer
sending you satellite images.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.260
He's on sabbatical.

19:20.293 --> 19:21.894
CHARLIE:
Hey, Don. We got a location

19:21.928 --> 19:23.830
- on the dummy bombs.
- All right. Good.

19:23.863 --> 19:26.466
See? I told you--
I know what I'm doing.

19:26.499 --> 19:27.667
All right, Buckley. Well done.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.802
They're going to be taking
you back in about 20 minutes.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.371
- Oh, come on.
- LIZ: Let's go.

19:31.404 --> 19:32.972
Oh, tough love. Hey.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.774
What do you say,
two years from now,

19:34.807 --> 19:37.844
you and me-- dinner, Malibu,
Le Coal Keel.

19:37.877 --> 19:39.446
What do you think?

19:39.479 --> 19:41.448
Give me two years
to think about it.

19:41.481 --> 19:43.216
That wasn't a no.

19:43.250 --> 19:44.951
Eppes, do me a favor.

19:44.984 --> 19:46.286
Once you bust Maddux,

19:46.319 --> 19:47.754
you give him a message.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.456
What's that?

19:49.489 --> 19:52.359
Nobody uses my master plan
and gets away with it.

19:52.392 --> 19:53.726
Not even me.

19:54.994 --> 19:56.996
Au revoir, mademoiselle.

19:57.029 --> 20:00.667
(speaking French)

20:00.700 --> 20:02.569
DON:
Marcus, get him out of here.

20:02.602 --> 20:05.372
Keep an eye on him.

20:05.405 --> 20:06.839
It's a shame.

20:06.873 --> 20:09.542
Guy could have been a CEO
if he hadn't become a crook.

20:09.576 --> 20:10.810
What's the difference?

20:19.752 --> 20:21.288
We're ready, Don.

20:23.856 --> 20:25.425
Nikki, you got eyes?

20:25.458 --> 20:27.527
Three bad guys on the main floor

20:27.560 --> 20:30.463
of the Exchange
with the hostages.

20:30.497 --> 20:31.931
Your brother...

20:31.964 --> 20:33.666
he really doesn't like me.

20:33.700 --> 20:35.868
Well, it takes him a while
to warm up to people.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.404
Is that what it is?

20:37.437 --> 20:38.538
No.

20:50.850 --> 20:52.385
I cut the initiator wire.

20:52.419 --> 20:53.520
It's not hot.

20:53.553 --> 20:54.454
Bomb's a dummy.

20:54.487 --> 20:55.755
DAVID:
Rear door's clear.

21:00.727 --> 21:03.396
We got a dummy bomb on
the side door, too. We're clear.

21:04.531 --> 21:05.665
All right.

21:05.698 --> 21:07.400
Here we go. We're going in.

21:07.434 --> 21:08.635
Hit it.

21:22.615 --> 21:23.983
Got orders
to escort the prisoner

21:24.016 --> 21:25.852
- back to Terminal Island.
- Oh, no, not now.

21:25.885 --> 21:28.488
Come on. I've given you
so much information.

21:28.521 --> 21:29.522
All right, well, it was nice
working with you, Professor.

21:29.556 --> 21:31.558
Maybe you'll let me teach
one of your classes

21:31.591 --> 21:32.992
next time, when I get out.

21:33.025 --> 21:34.827
Oh, yeah, that'll go over
with the trustees.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.669
What's up
with the mirror?

21:47.039 --> 21:48.608
(small explosions booming)

21:48.641 --> 21:50.477
- FBI!
- FBI!

21:50.510 --> 21:52.345
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
- Don't move!

21:52.379 --> 21:53.746
Don't shoot.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.648
DON:
Got anything on you? Huh?

21:57.950 --> 22:00.620
It's a rubber gun. It's fake.

22:00.653 --> 22:01.654
All right, what's going on?

22:02.889 --> 22:04.691
Oh, we've been had.

22:06.693 --> 22:08.495
All right. Take it easy.

22:08.528 --> 22:09.996
- Let's go. Get in the truck.
- What?

22:10.029 --> 22:11.063
You drive.

22:11.097 --> 22:12.031
- Hey! Hey, what's going on?
- Shut up, Buckley.

22:12.064 --> 22:13.866
- You're coming with us.
- Hey, take it easy!

22:13.900 --> 22:15.568
Charlie!

22:15.602 --> 22:17.537
(screams)
(gunshot)

22:17.570 --> 22:19.972
BUCKLEY:
Professor! Professor!

22:20.006 --> 22:21.541
What the hell?

22:21.574 --> 22:23.410
(indistinct radio transmission)

22:23.443 --> 22:24.844
Help! Help!

22:24.877 --> 22:26.613
Help!

22:26.646 --> 22:27.580
You're going to drive.

22:27.614 --> 22:29.716
- Get in the driver's seat.
- I can't drive!

22:29.749 --> 22:30.817
Yeah, drive the truck.
(screaming)

22:30.850 --> 22:31.951
Come on, drive the truck.

22:40.126 --> 22:43.663
(siren wailing)

22:45.965 --> 22:47.634
Put your foot on the gas
and drive.

22:47.667 --> 22:49.669
I'm trying! My leg.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.370
Faster!
(screams)

23:00.647 --> 23:02.048
These guys had it
all planned out.

23:02.081 --> 23:03.650
They didn't stop you
from triggering the alarm.

23:03.683 --> 23:06.152
Yeah, well, I paid the price.

23:06.185 --> 23:07.954
Yeah, how did Maddux's guys
trade places

23:07.987 --> 23:09.088
with you and your employees?

23:09.121 --> 23:11.791
Um... before the food arrived,

23:11.824 --> 23:14.093
they took us to the men's room
on a bathroom break.

23:14.126 --> 23:15.995
They gave us rubber guns.

23:16.028 --> 23:17.129
Told you, if you
didn't play along,

23:17.163 --> 23:18.130
- they'd blow up the building?
- Yeah.

23:18.164 --> 23:19.566
They were waiting
for the food delivery guys

23:19.599 --> 23:20.767
and the cop in the vestibule.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.201
They'd already stripped off
their jumpsuits.

23:22.234 --> 23:24.203
They had matching uniforms on
underneath.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.105
Explains why they
were so specific

23:26.138 --> 23:27.039
about their choice in takeout.

23:27.073 --> 23:29.542
And why they only wanted
one police escort.

23:29.576 --> 23:31.077
And then, the one dressed
like the SWAT guy

23:31.110 --> 23:32.078
Tasered all of them.

23:32.111 --> 23:33.546
Knocked them unconscious.

23:33.580 --> 23:34.914
LIZ: And the guys dressed
like delivery men

23:34.947 --> 23:35.748
finished making the delivery.

23:35.782 --> 23:37.550
DAVID:
And then, all three of them

23:37.584 --> 23:38.951
walked right out the door

23:38.985 --> 23:40.487
like nothing even happened.

23:40.520 --> 23:42.088
(sighs)
What I don't get is...

23:42.121 --> 23:44.524
You know, we had eyes
on them from the outside.

23:44.557 --> 23:46.225
I mean, we saw them going in.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.628
Ah, but what you saw
was a reflection.

23:48.661 --> 23:50.897
They took advantage
of the existing architecture,

23:50.930 --> 23:52.064
the mirrored glass,

23:52.098 --> 23:54.233
and then they made
some critical additions.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.768
Threw in more mirrors.

23:55.802 --> 23:57.537
And it made it look like

23:57.570 --> 24:00.106
our two bad guys
walking in from the side

24:00.139 --> 24:02.008
were our two delivery guys
heading straight in.

24:08.114 --> 24:09.516
And, of course,
they covered the switch

24:09.549 --> 24:11.117
with a little help
from Mother Nature.

24:15.154 --> 24:17.757
I remember the sun kicking off
the door when it closed.

24:17.790 --> 24:19.859
It took my eyes a couple
of seconds to adjust.

24:19.892 --> 24:21.928
Well, yeah.
Those are the seconds they used

24:21.961 --> 24:23.162
to pull the switch.

24:23.195 --> 24:24.597
Misdirection.

24:24.631 --> 24:26.132
Buckley's lesson number one.

24:28.067 --> 24:29.736
DAVID: LAPD found
the mobile command post

24:29.769 --> 24:31.771
abandoned in an alley
four blocks away.

24:31.804 --> 24:32.805
There were tire tracks,

24:32.839 --> 24:34.240
so someone
took off in a hurry.

24:34.273 --> 24:35.875
All right, so they
had a car waiting.

24:35.908 --> 24:37.276
Also, the Exchange
ran an inventory.

24:37.309 --> 24:38.878
So far, nothing is missing.

24:38.911 --> 24:40.146
Well, they had to take
something, right?

24:40.179 --> 24:41.681
- Yeah. Buckley.
- You don't really think

24:41.714 --> 24:43.550
he cooked this whole thing up
just to escape.

24:43.583 --> 24:44.917
Pretty elaborate.

24:44.951 --> 24:46.919
Overengineering is the
mathematical terminology.

24:46.953 --> 24:48.220
It smells like Buckley.
I say the guy

24:48.254 --> 24:49.221
has played us from the get-go.

24:49.255 --> 24:50.557
Don, he's been cooperating.

24:50.590 --> 24:51.791
He's given us
information on Maddux,

24:51.824 --> 24:53.259
I mean, what they've been up to.

24:53.292 --> 24:55.061
If it smells like Buckley,

24:55.094 --> 24:56.829
it might be because
they're using his plan.

24:56.863 --> 24:58.531
Don, the guy got shot.

24:58.565 --> 24:59.799
We found blood
and the spent shell.

24:59.832 --> 25:01.267
Also didn't look like
he had a lot of choice

25:01.300 --> 25:02.334
driving that
command vehicle, either.

25:02.368 --> 25:04.871
And all the math I've done
indicates his innocence.

25:04.904 --> 25:06.072
Yeah, and how you figure that?

25:06.105 --> 25:07.740
Game theory.
Buckley knows it pretty well.

25:07.774 --> 25:10.142
The DA offered him
two years in prison.

25:10.176 --> 25:12.211
There's no way he's going
to risk getting caught

25:12.244 --> 25:14.981
on an attempted escape,
only to serve ten more.

25:16.783 --> 25:19.051
- You're still not buying it.
- No.

25:19.085 --> 25:21.287
I ran the phone logs for the
Exchange's security contractor.

25:21.320 --> 25:23.623
Maddux made a series
of phone calls to a woman

25:23.656 --> 25:25.157
in the department
that handles maintenance

25:25.191 --> 25:26.993
for the IP camera system.

25:27.026 --> 25:29.328
Name's Lola Sacco.

25:29.361 --> 25:31.297
Miss Morro Bay, 2005?

25:31.330 --> 25:33.600
I didn't realize
that you were a fan of pageants.

25:35.868 --> 25:38.304
They promote world peace.

25:38.337 --> 25:41.307
It could be that, uh,
Buckley was right again.

25:41.340 --> 25:43.209
You know, maybe we found
our inside chick.

25:48.380 --> 25:50.349
Lola Sacco.

25:50.382 --> 25:52.151
Like to ask you
a few questions.

25:52.184 --> 25:55.354
Is this about stealing
office supplies?

25:55.387 --> 25:56.656
No.

25:56.689 --> 25:58.124
Do you recognize him?

26:01.928 --> 26:04.897
Gil, isn't this your boyfriend?

26:04.931 --> 26:06.766
You haven't been using
my phone again, have you?

26:08.367 --> 26:10.336
I had a fling with the guy.

26:10.369 --> 26:11.971
A two-week affair
two months ago.

26:12.004 --> 26:13.205
NIKKI: Must have been
some two weeks.

26:13.239 --> 26:14.440
DAVID:
You're going to prison.

26:14.473 --> 26:17.309
Now, how long depends on the
answers you give us right now,

26:17.343 --> 26:20.212
so I suggest that you give it
some careful thought.

26:20.246 --> 26:22.314
Where's Maddux?

26:22.348 --> 26:23.149
I don't know.

26:23.182 --> 26:24.150
See, I don't
think careful thought

26:24.183 --> 26:26.252
- went into that one.
- I swear, I don't know.

26:29.421 --> 26:33.760
Look, he wanted to know
about the IP cameras.

26:33.793 --> 26:35.294
Their placement,
how they're networked,

26:35.327 --> 26:37.764
- how to hack the system.
- And you gave it to him.

26:37.797 --> 26:39.732
He said he was going to kill me.
You don't understand.

26:39.766 --> 26:41.968
- He's a scary guy.
- NIKKI: What else?

26:42.001 --> 26:44.103
He wanted access
to the Exchange,

26:44.136 --> 26:45.772
off-hours, over a weekend.

26:45.805 --> 26:47.406
He told me he was going
to install some device

26:47.439 --> 26:49.275
inside one of the cameras
on the trading room floor.

26:49.308 --> 26:51.043
- What kind of device?
- I don't know.

26:51.077 --> 26:52.144
Why the trading room floor?

26:52.178 --> 26:53.212
I don't know that, either.

26:54.180 --> 26:56.883
You recognize this guy?

26:56.916 --> 26:59.618
Never seen him before
in my life.

27:01.453 --> 27:03.055
I'm sorry to hear that.

27:03.089 --> 27:05.324
You're prolonging the situation.

27:05.357 --> 27:08.227
Letting me think
that I'm in control

27:08.260 --> 27:11.297
when the truth is,
I am in control!

27:11.330 --> 27:12.999
You still think he's in on it.

27:13.032 --> 27:15.267
Yeah, I know what the facts say.

27:15.301 --> 27:17.269
There's a call for you,
line one.

27:17.303 --> 27:19.405
- Who?
- Didn't get a name.

27:19.438 --> 27:20.907
Guy's on a cell,
keeps breaking up.

27:20.940 --> 27:22.975
All I know
is he kept yelling at me,

27:23.009 --> 27:25.277
calling me an idiot
and telling me to get Eppes.

27:27.379 --> 27:29.315
(sighs)

27:31.884 --> 27:33.319
Buckley, what do you want?

27:33.352 --> 27:34.687
How'd you know it was me?

27:34.721 --> 27:36.689
Unlucky guess. Where are you?

27:36.723 --> 27:38.858
Kind of hard to tell
at the moment.

27:38.891 --> 27:40.259
Wait-wait a second.

27:40.292 --> 27:41.293
Hold-hold on.

27:44.263 --> 27:47.266
(sighs)
There, that's better.

27:47.299 --> 27:49.836
Given that my current location

27:49.869 --> 27:52.071
is in the trunk
of a speeding car,

27:52.104 --> 27:54.440
I can't really see much.

27:54.473 --> 27:57.476
It looks like I am somewhere
in the Valley.

27:57.509 --> 28:01.914
Look, Eppes, I know you think
I masterminded this whole thing.

28:01.948 --> 28:04.050
- Nah.
- And while I am very flattered,

28:04.083 --> 28:06.185
I had nothing to do with this.

28:06.218 --> 28:09.388
I got a situation here now,
Eppes, and I need your help.

28:09.421 --> 28:11.290
Well, I need
a little convincing.

28:11.323 --> 28:13.092
(thump)
Ow!

28:13.125 --> 28:15.027
The trunk of a speeding car
isn't enough?

28:15.061 --> 28:16.295
Fine! (groans)

28:16.328 --> 28:20.432
Look, Maddux knew that you were
getting tipped off somewhere.

28:20.466 --> 28:24.370
He grabbed me,
and he made me do the driving.

28:24.403 --> 28:26.272
The guy was holding a gun
to my head.

28:26.305 --> 28:27.940
What was I supposed to do?

28:27.974 --> 28:29.475
Well, why aren't you dead?

28:29.508 --> 28:31.043
'Cause Maddux is the kind of guy

28:31.077 --> 28:33.379
that tortured small animals
when he was a child.

28:33.412 --> 28:35.314
Fortunately, he never grew up.

28:36.816 --> 28:38.951
You have any idea
where you're headed?

28:38.985 --> 28:40.519
The airport.

28:40.552 --> 28:42.989
I'm afraid that he's going
to make a quick stop

28:43.022 --> 28:45.457
and drop me in a ditch
on the side of the road.

28:45.491 --> 28:47.459
(coughing):
My leg is killing me.

28:47.493 --> 28:49.328
Do me a favor, Eppes.

28:49.361 --> 28:50.329
Can you get your brother?

28:50.362 --> 28:52.264
Maybe he can figure out
some kind of equation

28:52.298 --> 28:53.432
to help get me out of here.

29:02.341 --> 29:04.143
(beeping)

29:04.176 --> 29:06.478
- All right, how close?
- I got a lock.

29:06.512 --> 29:08.380
We're running it
through the service provider.

29:08.414 --> 29:09.949
I'm glad you're on the job,
Professor.

29:11.383 --> 29:13.052
Wait a second.
Now, this doesn't make sense.

29:13.085 --> 29:14.821
The I.D. and location--

29:14.854 --> 29:17.189
it's a call coming
from Gifford Kemp.

29:17.223 --> 29:18.524
He's on the 12th tee

29:18.557 --> 29:20.092
of the Rancho Segundo
Country Club.

29:20.126 --> 29:22.094
(groaning):
Oh!

29:22.128 --> 29:24.030
Maddux is using a cloned phone.

29:24.063 --> 29:25.231
The cheap bastard.

29:25.264 --> 29:27.399
This is definitely not my day.

29:27.433 --> 29:28.500
What do we do?

29:28.534 --> 29:32.171
I mean, I-I designed a-a variant
on path minimization

29:32.204 --> 29:35.474
that, uh... that maps routes
that criminals would take,

29:35.507 --> 29:37.476
avoiding law enforcement
hot spots

29:37.509 --> 29:39.345
like police stations
and hospitals.

29:39.378 --> 29:41.247
Don't forget doughnut shops.

29:41.280 --> 29:43.349
Yeah, I need you to give me
some landmarks.

29:43.382 --> 29:46.585
Well, it's kind of hard to see
out of this rat hole,

29:46.618 --> 29:49.155
but (groans) I'll do my best.

29:49.188 --> 29:53.559
Uh, I see
a Really Berry Frozen Yogurt.

29:53.592 --> 29:56.428
Really Berry...

29:56.462 --> 29:58.297
Yeah, there's 47 locations.

29:58.330 --> 30:00.332
That's not going to work,
Buckley. We need something else.

30:00.366 --> 30:01.600
Great. Uh...

30:01.633 --> 30:04.303
"Relax the Spine."

30:04.336 --> 30:06.372
I need something
that's not a chain.

30:06.405 --> 30:08.941
It's the Valley.
What do you expect?

30:08.975 --> 30:10.009
Um...

30:10.042 --> 30:11.177
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait!

30:11.210 --> 30:13.479
Here's something.

30:13.512 --> 30:15.381
Mitzvah Treatment Center.

30:17.984 --> 30:20.119
There's 13 Mitzvah
Treatment Centers?

30:20.152 --> 30:22.188
- You got to be kidding me.
- BUCKLEY: Uh-oh.

30:22.221 --> 30:25.157
Uh, Eppes, Eppes, I'm having
a little problem here.

30:25.191 --> 30:26.458
Buckley, you're breaking up.

30:26.492 --> 30:27.426
Yeah, that's my problem.

30:27.459 --> 30:29.328
I'm running low on battery.
(phone chirps)

30:31.063 --> 30:32.899
We're down
to a four-mile radius.

30:32.932 --> 30:35.067
(groans)
Buckley?

30:35.101 --> 30:36.535
Eppes...
(phone chirps)

30:36.568 --> 30:39.205
Look, tell your boys...

30:39.238 --> 30:42.608
to look for a car
with a white flag.

30:45.244 --> 30:46.545
Buckley?

30:46.578 --> 30:49.348
Eppes, whatever happens,
(phone chirps)

30:49.381 --> 30:53.019
I know you and your brother were
just trying to do your best.

30:53.052 --> 30:55.187
I know...
(phone chirps)

30:57.156 --> 30:58.891
Buckley! Hey!

30:58.925 --> 31:00.927
Buckley!
Give me what you've got.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.929
I'm going to put units
in the area.

31:26.552 --> 31:28.654
(David sighs)

31:28.687 --> 31:31.223
- He's alive.
- Him, too.

31:31.257 --> 31:32.992
Maddux's boys.

31:33.025 --> 31:35.161
Guess he sold them out.

31:35.194 --> 31:37.363
All right, we've got Buckley's
phone. Where's Buckley?

31:37.396 --> 31:39.698
That's a lot of blood.

31:39.731 --> 31:41.700
- NIKKI: It's not theirs.
- DAVID: Buckley said

31:41.733 --> 31:42.768
that Maddux would dump him

31:42.801 --> 31:45.604
by the side of the road
when he was done with him.

31:45.637 --> 31:46.472
He's been right
about everything else.

31:46.505 --> 31:49.441
Looks like he called it
this time, too.

31:58.184 --> 31:59.551
DAVID:
What happened to Buckley?

31:59.585 --> 32:02.421
What do you think?

32:02.454 --> 32:04.690
Maddux took him
for a walk down by the river.

32:04.723 --> 32:06.458
That's the last I saw of him.

32:06.492 --> 32:07.559
He's funny that way.

32:07.593 --> 32:09.261
He likes privacy
when he does someone.

32:09.295 --> 32:10.362
Likes to take his time.

32:10.396 --> 32:11.663
All right,
where's Maddux going now?

32:11.697 --> 32:13.032
He stopped sharing his plans

32:13.065 --> 32:14.600
around the time
he threw me in the trunk.

32:14.633 --> 32:16.202
What about your plans
before that?

32:16.235 --> 32:17.203
We know you guys didn't steal

32:17.236 --> 32:18.204
any diamonds from the Exchange,

32:18.237 --> 32:20.206
so what did you steal?

32:20.239 --> 32:23.042
Access to their accounts.

32:23.075 --> 32:24.743
The $16 million

32:24.776 --> 32:27.479
we got from the bus hijacking
was wired to the Caymans.

32:27.513 --> 32:29.315
But Interpol put a trace
on the money,

32:29.348 --> 32:31.183
so we needed to launder it.

32:31.217 --> 32:32.651
Using the Diamond Exchange.

32:32.684 --> 32:34.253
They do million-dollar transfers
every day.

32:35.654 --> 32:38.090
Money laundering takes time.

32:38.124 --> 32:40.226
You were only there
for a few hours.

32:40.259 --> 32:41.460
We had a computer program

32:41.493 --> 32:43.295
to run the transactions
already set up.

32:43.329 --> 32:45.131
We already had
all the account numbers

32:45.164 --> 32:46.365
and passwords.

32:46.398 --> 32:48.200
How?

32:49.368 --> 32:51.270
We had a spy.

32:58.677 --> 32:59.745
Hey.

32:59.778 --> 33:02.181
So, the techs just examined
the IP security cameras

33:02.214 --> 33:03.282
from the Exchange.

33:03.315 --> 33:05.317
And Maddux's inside guy told us

33:05.351 --> 33:06.785
that Maddux
had implanted a device

33:06.818 --> 33:10.189
in one of the cameras
on the trading room floor.

33:10.222 --> 33:11.390
Here it is.

33:11.423 --> 33:13.192
Looks like a thumb-drive.

33:13.225 --> 33:15.161
Attached to a laser reader
built into the camera.

33:15.194 --> 33:16.462
Now, this particular camera

33:16.495 --> 33:19.165
had a view
of the wire-transfer desk,

33:19.198 --> 33:21.100
which is how it recorded

33:21.133 --> 33:23.135
all the passwords
and account numbers.

33:23.169 --> 33:24.303
Yeah, but you can't see
the screens.

33:24.336 --> 33:25.704
With a laser reader,
you don't have to,

33:25.737 --> 33:27.373
because it doesn't read
words on the screen.

33:27.406 --> 33:29.375
It reads vibrational pulses

33:29.408 --> 33:32.344
emitted by keystrokes
as it types.

33:32.378 --> 33:34.346
It's like reading Braille.

33:34.380 --> 33:36.315
In Braille, each letter
or numeral is represented

33:36.348 --> 33:37.683
by a pattern of dots,

33:37.716 --> 33:40.219
just like keystrokes
on a computer are represented

33:40.252 --> 33:42.788
by a pattern of pulses
and vibrations.

33:42.821 --> 33:47.226
For example, the letter "Y"
emits a different

33:47.259 --> 33:49.228
vibrational pulse
than the letter "O," which

33:49.261 --> 33:51.397
emits a different vibrational
pulse than the letter "U."

33:51.430 --> 33:54.433
And by reading the keystrokes,
capturing them,

33:54.466 --> 33:56.202
it can record

33:56.235 --> 33:58.570
whatever information
that is typed in--

33:58.604 --> 34:00.339
uh, log-ins, passwords,
messages.

34:00.372 --> 34:02.408
Now, here's the beauty of it.

34:02.441 --> 34:04.476
Maddux has basically given us
the rope to hang him with.

34:04.510 --> 34:05.811
Okay, how?

34:05.844 --> 34:07.113
The laser reader, which he used

34:07.146 --> 34:08.214
to steal all the information,

34:08.247 --> 34:09.748
also recorded

34:09.781 --> 34:13.285
his money laundering program,
all on this thumb-drive.

34:13.319 --> 34:15.087
So, you can reconstruct
the program,

34:15.121 --> 34:16.522
use it to trace the money?

34:16.555 --> 34:17.723
Straight to Maddux.

34:17.756 --> 34:19.391
Shouldn't take more
than a couple hours.

34:19.425 --> 34:21.360
(computer trilling)

34:21.393 --> 34:22.861
AMITA:
You know, I've been thinking

34:22.894 --> 34:24.863
about what Buckley said.

34:24.896 --> 34:27.366
Oh, what, about how I'm...
I'm a lucky guy?

34:27.399 --> 34:30.136
No, about honeymooning
in Costa Rica.

34:30.169 --> 34:31.270
Depending on the time of year,
lots of rain.

34:31.303 --> 34:32.204
So, we'll bring umbrellas.

34:32.238 --> 34:34.406
Scorpions.
They have scorpions down there.

34:34.440 --> 34:36.108
They sleep in people's shoes.

34:36.142 --> 34:37.209
So, we'll wear sandals.

34:37.243 --> 34:38.410
A very long flight.

34:38.444 --> 34:40.346
Not if we take separate planes.

34:40.379 --> 34:42.114
DON:
Hey, anything?

34:42.148 --> 34:43.749
AMITA:
We're getting close.

34:43.782 --> 34:45.317
What do you think
about Costa Rica?

34:46.585 --> 34:47.719
Uh, I don't know. I mean, I hear

34:47.753 --> 34:49.421
they have a lot of scorpions.

34:50.589 --> 34:53.225
Ah, looks like
we followed the money.

34:53.259 --> 34:54.025
Yeah?

34:54.059 --> 34:55.294
Oh, wait a second.
I don't get it.

34:55.327 --> 34:56.695
What?

34:56.728 --> 34:58.297
Maddux bounced $16 million
halfway around the globe,

34:58.330 --> 35:00.232
only to have it land
back where it started?

35:00.266 --> 35:02.268
AMITA:
The Exchange. Looks like Maddux

35:02.301 --> 35:03.435
converted the money
into diamonds.

35:03.469 --> 35:04.803
CHARLIE:
No, wait a second.

35:04.836 --> 35:06.705
There-there's a pickup
scheduled for today,

35:06.738 --> 35:08.907
and there's a consignee
whose I.D.

35:08.940 --> 35:10.276
is listed on the file.

35:10.309 --> 35:11.643
DON:
Yeah, yeah. Who's that?

35:11.677 --> 35:12.644
It's Lola Sacco.

35:12.678 --> 35:14.780
Wasn't she Miss Morro Bay?

35:21.920 --> 35:23.455
We've got Lola.

35:27.293 --> 35:29.295
And we got Maddux.

35:32.198 --> 35:33.665
- Hey.
- Geez.

35:33.699 --> 35:35.133
Hand it over.

35:36.368 --> 35:37.403
(click)

35:48.614 --> 35:51.383
(grunting)

35:51.417 --> 35:53.419
I got her.

36:01.427 --> 36:02.494
Whoa.

36:05.531 --> 36:07.199
What'd you do with Buckley?

36:07.233 --> 36:08.500
Do with him?

36:08.534 --> 36:10.402
I didn't do anything with him,

36:10.436 --> 36:12.238
except get screwed.

36:12.271 --> 36:13.505
At least I put a bullet
in his leg.

36:14.940 --> 36:17.709
It's a little flourish
for effect.

36:17.743 --> 36:19.245
Buckley's not dead?

36:19.278 --> 36:21.513
He suckered you, too.

36:21.547 --> 36:22.381
(Maddux chuckles)

36:23.649 --> 36:25.351
One day on the prison yard,

36:25.384 --> 36:27.786
he comes, sits down,
starts talking.

36:27.819 --> 36:30.956
Tells me I can make a score
hijacking a bus,

36:30.989 --> 36:32.624
laundering the money

36:32.658 --> 36:34.393
by busting a Diamond Exchange.

36:34.426 --> 36:36.328
$16 million, foolproof.

36:37.496 --> 36:39.465
There was just one catch.

36:39.498 --> 36:40.999
He needed to be a part of it.

36:41.032 --> 36:43.235
Hmm.

36:43.269 --> 36:45.837
He knew that you'd go
to him for help.

36:45.871 --> 36:47.839
That got him out the front gate.

36:47.873 --> 36:49.508
So, this taking him down
to the river...

36:49.541 --> 36:51.443
It was all his idea for show.

36:51.477 --> 36:54.380
After he convinced me
to double-cross the boys,

36:54.413 --> 36:55.547
meet back at the Exchange.

36:55.581 --> 36:56.615
I knew he'd screw me,

36:56.648 --> 36:58.417
so I waited

36:58.450 --> 36:59.351
for Lola
to pick up the diamonds.

36:59.385 --> 37:01.387
I figured she could lead me
back to him.

37:02.888 --> 37:05.791
Looks like Buckley found
his inside chick after all.

37:08.660 --> 37:10.829
Obviously, there's been
a misunderstanding.

37:10.862 --> 37:12.431
He set you up.

37:12.464 --> 37:14.366
I don't know
what you're talking about.

37:14.400 --> 37:16.368
Buckley tricked you
and Maddux

37:16.402 --> 37:18.036
into pulling off
the Diamond Exchange job.

37:18.069 --> 37:20.539
I'm sure he promised,
at the end of the day,

37:20.572 --> 37:22.808
you two would be the ones
walking off with the money,

37:22.841 --> 37:24.510
but you had other ideas.

37:24.543 --> 37:27.646
Found your flight reservation.

37:27.679 --> 37:30.782
One ticket,
one-way, to SГЈo Paulo.

37:30.816 --> 37:32.851
You were going
to cut Buckley out.

37:32.884 --> 37:35.754
Except Buckley knew
that there was no way

37:35.787 --> 37:38.357
to make off
with 16 million bucks.

37:38.390 --> 37:41.527
When the cash was converted
into diamonds,

37:41.560 --> 37:44.396
there was a one and a half
percent transaction fee.

37:46.031 --> 37:48.434
$240,000.

37:48.467 --> 37:50.068
Buckley had it wired

37:50.101 --> 37:51.537
into an overseas account,

37:51.570 --> 37:53.505
where it disappeared,
just like him.

37:53.539 --> 37:56.742
Right, he said he always looks

37:56.775 --> 37:59.645
for an inside chick
to take advantage of.

37:59.678 --> 38:02.080
Yeah, and this time,

38:02.113 --> 38:04.750
he picked one that he knew
would double-cross him,

38:04.783 --> 38:07.486
one he knew he could leave
holding the bag.

38:09.955 --> 38:12.458
Hotel St. Eve.

38:12.491 --> 38:14.393
Room 301.

38:19.565 --> 38:20.566
Clear.

38:20.599 --> 38:21.667
DAVID:
Clear.

38:24.703 --> 38:25.871
DAVID:
Don.

38:25.904 --> 38:29.107
"Dinner for the Eppes family,
on me.

38:29.140 --> 38:30.241
Bon appГ©tit."

38:30.275 --> 38:33.111
"If the fries are soggy,
you were slower than I gave you

38:33.144 --> 38:35.313
credit for."

38:41.553 --> 38:43.689
ALAN:
These, uh, fries--

38:43.722 --> 38:45.591
they are quite soggy.

38:47.626 --> 38:48.827
Come on, Donnie.

38:48.860 --> 38:51.129
- You win some, you lose some.
- Yeah, I don't like losing.

38:51.162 --> 38:52.531
CHARLIE: You know,
there's nothing on here.

38:52.564 --> 38:53.699
This is a new computer.

38:53.732 --> 38:54.933
It's just the...
the usual software.

38:54.966 --> 38:56.568
DON:
Would you do me a favor

38:56.602 --> 38:57.703
and just keep looking?

38:57.736 --> 39:00.472
(ringing)

39:00.506 --> 39:01.507
DON:
What's that?

39:01.540 --> 39:02.508
It's a Web call.

39:03.775 --> 39:05.944
How's the food?

39:05.977 --> 39:06.945
(Alan laughs and grunts)

39:06.978 --> 39:08.980
(clears throat)
Pretty good, thank you. Um...

39:10.582 --> 39:12.518
DON:
What happened to Costa Rica?

39:12.551 --> 39:13.785
The banking laws
in Liechtenstein

39:13.819 --> 39:15.954
are a bit more to my liking.

39:15.987 --> 39:17.523
And the doctors, too.

39:17.556 --> 39:19.625
My-my leg is still smarting
a bit.

39:19.658 --> 39:21.527
Can't imagine a couple hundred
thousand dollars is going

39:21.560 --> 39:23.395
to keep a guy like you
happy too long.

39:23.429 --> 39:27.666
Yeah, well, I'm not too worried
about picking up some more cash

39:27.699 --> 39:29.435
somewhere, somehow.

39:29.468 --> 39:31.002
- It's never been my problem.
- Yeah, well,

39:31.036 --> 39:33.071
I'll be sure to keep an eye
on the bus schedules.

39:33.104 --> 39:34.506
Oh, that's good.

39:34.540 --> 39:36.475
I like that.

39:36.508 --> 39:39.511
You know, Eppes, you and me--

39:39.545 --> 39:43.148
under different circumstances,
we could have been friends.

39:43.181 --> 39:44.516
Yeah, sure we could.

39:44.550 --> 39:45.684
Hey, Professor.

39:45.717 --> 39:47.586
I'm serious
about teaching that class.

39:47.619 --> 39:48.520
CHARLIE:
Oh, yeah?

39:48.554 --> 39:50.689
Well, we'll have
to do it online, I guess.

39:50.722 --> 39:51.923
Oh. Oh, that's for him.

39:51.957 --> 39:53.659
(laughs)

39:53.692 --> 39:55.861
Would you say hello
to my friends in California?

39:55.894 --> 39:57.095
Thanks, Heidi.

39:57.128 --> 39:58.630
She's a doll.

39:58.664 --> 40:00.566
You know, Eppes,
you and I-- we're like

40:00.599 --> 40:02.768
those cartoon characters,
Sam and Ralph,

40:02.801 --> 40:04.703
the sheepdog and the wolf.

40:04.736 --> 40:07.172
We just keep going at each other

40:07.205 --> 40:09.007
because we don't know
what else to do.

40:09.040 --> 40:10.876
You should take some time off.

40:10.909 --> 40:14.480
We could go skiing. Mmm.

40:14.513 --> 40:16.715
You know what?

40:16.748 --> 40:18.550
I'll keep this on ice for you.

40:18.584 --> 40:19.751
Auf Wiedersehen.

40:22.654 --> 40:24.856
You know,
the wolf always gets caught.

40:26.224 --> 40:27.559
If that's what you really want.

40:28.694 --> 40:31.062
Hey, I could use a vacation.

40:31.096 --> 40:32.798
(laughs)
Yeah.

40:32.831 --> 40:34.733
(laughs)
