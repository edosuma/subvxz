00:36.036 --> 00:38.497
ALL CHARACTERS,
ORGANIZATIONS, CASES,

00:38.581 --> 00:40.958
AND SETTINGS DEPICTED
ARE FICTIONAL

00:45.796 --> 00:48.799
NEW YEAR'S
DISCIPLINARY TOUR PERIOD

00:58.976 --> 01:00.519
Hey, kid.

01:00.603 --> 01:02.354
What are you in here for?

01:02.897 --> 01:04.523
Mugging? Theft?

01:06.442 --> 01:08.110
I was 12 years old that winter.

01:08.194 --> 01:10.988
I got locked up
for my first attempt at a dine and dash.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.406
It was cold and scary.

01:12.490 --> 01:14.658
He's my brother. Why can't I see him?

01:14.742 --> 01:16.494
Bring your parents first.

01:17.119 --> 01:18.287
We don't have one.

01:18.370 --> 01:20.247
I'm his guardian!

01:20.331 --> 01:22.124
Minors aren't qualified whatsoever.

01:22.208 --> 01:24.335
Any adult will do,
if you don't have parents.

01:25.461 --> 01:26.587
Hurry up and go.

01:28.798 --> 01:31.050
Detective, on that day…

01:34.261 --> 01:35.471
I keep telling you…

01:35.554 --> 01:38.307
It wasn't me.

01:39.308 --> 01:40.601
Hey!

01:40.684 --> 01:43.395
What do you think you're doing?
Have you lost your mind?

01:44.688 --> 01:47.107
I don't need parents
to get arrested, right?

01:51.779 --> 01:53.864
-Yong!
-Sis!

01:54.782 --> 01:57.493
Yong, are you okay?
It's all right, I'm here now.

01:57.576 --> 01:59.829
-Come here.
-Sis!

01:59.912 --> 02:01.288
-Come here!
-Hey!

02:01.372 --> 02:03.541
If anyone of you thugs mess with Yong,

02:03.624 --> 02:05.876
-I'm going to kill you all!
-Sis!

02:05.960 --> 02:09.046
Yong, are you okay? Are you injured?

02:09.129 --> 02:11.382
I'm sorry.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.259
Don't cry. Sorry for coming so late.

02:13.342 --> 02:16.220
I'm sorry, there's no need to cry.

02:16.303 --> 02:18.264
We didn't do anything wrong.

02:18.347 --> 02:19.557
You must've been scared.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.851
My sister did whatever it took
to make money.

02:21.934 --> 02:23.227
She was the breadwinner.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.271
-I'm here, it's okay now.
-She was my guardian

02:25.354 --> 02:26.605
who always stood by my side.

02:26.689 --> 02:28.482
Don't worry, I'll protect you.

02:30.901 --> 02:33.237
One spring day,
when flowers were fully bloomed,

02:34.071 --> 02:37.575
my 19-year-old sister mothered a son.

02:43.664 --> 02:44.957
Eun Yong, you're here.

02:46.417 --> 02:48.502
Say hello to your sister and your nephew.

02:48.586 --> 02:49.795
Yong.

02:50.588 --> 02:52.756
I am a mother now.

02:53.883 --> 02:55.467
Commend me for it.

02:56.218 --> 02:57.428
A fatherless child.

02:58.262 --> 03:02.016
I thought this would be another burden
and tragedy for my sister.

03:02.099 --> 03:04.268
Dear Lord, please shepherd this child

03:04.977 --> 03:07.855
towards the way of righteousness.

03:07.938 --> 03:11.025
I pray his words will spread your gospel

03:11.108 --> 03:14.111
and his actions will spread your love.

03:14.194 --> 03:17.072
As the flowers bloom in spring,
the warm love of spring…

03:17.156 --> 03:18.824
The poetry-loving nun named him…

03:18.908 --> 03:21.118
-In Jesus' name I pray.
-…"peaceful spring."

03:21.201 --> 03:23.787
-Amen.
-Jang Tae-chun.

03:24.371 --> 03:25.789
His name was Tae-chun.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.325
Have you lost your mind?

04:01.408 --> 04:03.243
You're a wanted man.
You shouldn't be here.

04:03.327 --> 04:06.413
If I hide, you'll pay the price.

04:07.539 --> 04:09.500
There's only one way out.

04:10.376 --> 04:11.877
Hey, Jang Tae-chun.

04:13.003 --> 04:14.338
Cuff me…

04:17.424 --> 04:18.884
with your own hands.

04:32.856 --> 04:36.068
WANTED FOR BLACKMAILING
CEO OH OF GMI BANK

04:36.694 --> 04:38.070
Yes, sir.

04:38.153 --> 04:41.615
For the time being,
I have Hwang Gi-seok in my office.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.868
Questioning him won't lead us anywhere.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.453
He'll just elude our questions.

04:47.204 --> 04:49.832
I'll figure out what happened first.

04:50.833 --> 04:52.334
Yes, sir.

04:52.418 --> 04:54.378
Don't worry. I'll let you know soon.

05:01.552 --> 05:02.553
Hey.

05:06.598 --> 05:07.599
What the hell is this?

05:07.683 --> 05:08.767
EVIDENCE COLLECTED

05:10.978 --> 05:12.438
This your father-in-law's villa?

05:13.105 --> 05:15.858
Yes. You've been there a few times.

05:19.528 --> 05:21.363
This is why Oh killed himself?

05:26.035 --> 05:27.494
Hey, you son of a bitch.

05:27.578 --> 05:29.246
You think you're so clean?

05:29.329 --> 05:31.248
You took our bribes, then backstabbed us.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.541
You're not so clean either.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.294
You little bastard.

05:35.377 --> 05:36.712
Fuck.

05:40.174 --> 05:41.550
Hello?

05:41.633 --> 05:42.760
Why?

05:43.510 --> 05:44.636
What?

05:46.013 --> 05:48.015
Fucking damn it.

05:49.058 --> 05:51.894
Is it true you blackmailed CEO Oh
into committing suicide?

05:51.977 --> 05:54.396
Any comment
on the suicide note he left behind?

05:54.480 --> 05:58.692
The late CEO Oh was
a great business partner of mine.

05:59.777 --> 06:03.155
We have reliable friends
who can vouch for our relationship.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.657
And as for everything else,

06:05.741 --> 06:07.618
I'll tell the prosecution in detail.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.411
Who are these reliable friends?

06:09.495 --> 06:11.205
Did you meet high-profile officials?

06:11.288 --> 06:12.748
All right, we'll stop here.

06:12.831 --> 06:13.832
He turned himself in?

06:13.916 --> 06:15.334
-Wait!
-One more question!

06:15.417 --> 06:18.921
-Give us one comment!
-One more question!

06:25.052 --> 06:27.596
Do you know
who these "reliable friends" are?

06:32.059 --> 06:33.560
I hope it's not you, Chief.

06:33.644 --> 06:36.063
-What'd you say?
-Looks like you lost the initiative.

06:36.146 --> 06:39.066
If he turns himself in like that,
the press will move on.

06:39.149 --> 06:42.236
They'll focus on finding
these so-called "reliable friends"

06:42.319 --> 06:43.946
rather than the wanted criminal.

06:44.029 --> 06:45.239
You little shit--

06:45.322 --> 06:46.949
Just let me take care of it.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.577
I'll wrap it up neatly,

06:51.286 --> 06:53.163
so that no harm comes to you either.

06:54.748 --> 06:57.543
With that brought to light,
you want me to trust you?

06:57.626 --> 06:59.545
Take care of it yourself then.

06:59.628 --> 07:01.046
You bastard.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.090
Trust me.

07:09.847 --> 07:11.265
I'm Hwang Gi-seok.

07:14.685 --> 07:16.061
Damn.

07:26.196 --> 07:27.447
You can uncuff him now.

07:31.368 --> 07:33.745
You've entered the lion's den on your own.

07:35.038 --> 07:36.456
It won't be easy.

07:38.208 --> 07:39.877
You're Chief Nam Sang-il, right?

07:40.377 --> 07:43.338
Please take good care of Prosecutor Jang.

07:43.422 --> 07:44.423
Gosh.

07:45.591 --> 07:47.050
You should worry about yourself.

07:55.392 --> 07:57.477
Hand over the suspect to us.

07:57.561 --> 07:58.687
No.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.440
He's our wanted criminal.

08:01.523 --> 08:03.817
He notified us he'd be coming in.

08:03.901 --> 08:06.904
And I'm the prosecutor in charge
of the GMI Bank Case.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.572
Not anymore.

08:08.655 --> 08:11.450
I'm from Inspection.
Prosecutor Jang Tae-chun.

08:11.533 --> 08:15.162
You're under arrest
for leaking confidential information.

08:15.245 --> 08:17.581
You can't arrest me.
I wasn't even caught in the act.

08:17.664 --> 08:20.125
Have you lost it?
Who do you think you're arresting?

08:20.209 --> 08:21.793
What do you think you're doing?

08:27.758 --> 08:29.176
Get rid of the cuffs.

08:29.801 --> 08:31.678
Just take him, Prosecutor Jang.

08:31.762 --> 08:33.430
You're still a prosecutor, after all.

08:35.265 --> 08:38.018
And you had such a bright future too.

08:41.021 --> 08:43.232
Thanks to your uncle,
you're about to be in cuffs.

08:51.406 --> 08:54.159
A prosecutor strikes a suspicious deal
with his ex-con uncle

08:54.243 --> 08:56.161
who runs a hedge fund.

08:57.996 --> 08:59.373
Nice headline.

09:00.332 --> 09:04.127
The sanatorium fees for Jang's mother,
it costs 30 million won a month.

09:05.128 --> 09:06.964
That's 400 million won a year.

09:09.174 --> 09:12.135
A hedge fund owner uncle
and a 400 million won sanatorium.

09:12.219 --> 09:16.473
That's enough to infuriate the citizens.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.392
They'll sentence him themselves.

09:21.311 --> 09:22.729
Why did you kill CEO Oh?

09:25.649 --> 09:27.317
Haven't you seen his suicide note?

09:27.401 --> 09:29.194
On the note,

09:29.278 --> 09:33.240
it stated that he committed suicide
because of your blackmailing.

09:37.327 --> 09:38.912
You are aware of that, no?

09:42.082 --> 09:44.835
Gosh, but I really didn't see this coming.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.963
I wasn't expecting for you
to turn yourself in like this.

09:48.046 --> 09:50.882
I'm sure it was your plan
to up my charge count

09:50.966 --> 09:53.593
while I was on the run,

09:53.677 --> 09:56.596
and make me out to be
the vilest criminal before arresting me.

09:57.180 --> 09:58.640
Am I wrong?

09:58.724 --> 10:02.519
Well, I didn't expect you'd threaten me
so publicly in front of the reporters.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.521
Mentioning your reliable friends and all.

10:06.481 --> 10:07.482
Right.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.735
That was unexpected.

10:11.236 --> 10:12.362
Nice one.

10:13.113 --> 10:16.199
I didn't expect my reliable friends
to arrange a meeting with you

10:16.867 --> 10:18.327
so quickly either.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.707
What a shame.

10:24.624 --> 10:28.587
If we didn't meet as enemies,
we could've been good friends.

10:29.379 --> 10:30.922
You and I are enemies?

10:34.051 --> 10:35.552
Well, I don't think so.

10:37.429 --> 10:39.514
My enemy is Chairman Myung.

10:41.558 --> 10:44.978
You're just a leech sucking on
your father-in-law's blood.

11:11.380 --> 11:13.256
I thought you were with CEO Eun.

11:13.340 --> 11:16.218
We saw the investigators out front,
so we parted ways.

11:16.301 --> 11:17.886
I told him to go to my house for now.

11:17.969 --> 11:20.889
You know he's not the type to listen.

11:20.972 --> 11:23.016
Whenever there's a problem,
he's always in the lead.

11:23.100 --> 11:25.727
He's all about making the first move
to win a fight.

11:25.811 --> 11:28.355
He turned himself in
because of Prosecutor Jang, right?

11:28.438 --> 11:30.690
I think so, but that's not the issue.

11:30.774 --> 11:33.402
Thanks to him for making it
on the news in cuffs,

11:33.485 --> 11:35.445
our company is a complete mess.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.782
Do you have any idea
how much money we lost today?

11:41.034 --> 11:44.913
Well, it was his choice,
so I don't want to give you an earful.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.041
But honestly, I kind of want to.

11:49.126 --> 11:50.252
Go ahead.

11:50.335 --> 11:52.879
I'm just worried for him
in the prosecution.

11:52.963 --> 11:54.881
Hwang Gi-seok won't let him off easy.

11:54.965 --> 11:56.383
Don't worry about that.

11:57.092 --> 11:59.845
We hired the most expensive attorney
we could buy.

12:06.685 --> 12:08.437
Sir! Welcome!

12:08.520 --> 12:09.604
KIM OH-CHEOL
ATTORNEY GENERAL

12:09.688 --> 12:10.689
Hey, guys.

12:11.356 --> 12:13.150
Oh, Chief Hwang. It's been a while.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.818
-Allow me to lead the way, sir.
-Okay.

12:18.613 --> 12:21.825
I've prepared some chrysanthemum tea,
the one you used to enjoy, sir.

12:21.908 --> 12:23.493
Let's go to my office first and--

12:23.577 --> 12:26.580
No need. I'm here as an attorney today.

12:26.663 --> 12:28.081
I'll meet the suspect first.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.168
I apologize for saying this,
but he's not here.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.128
We just sent him to jail.

12:33.211 --> 12:34.379
What did you say?

12:35.964 --> 12:37.466
My sincere apologies, sir.

12:37.549 --> 12:39.050
I should've told you sooner.

12:54.191 --> 12:56.818
EMERGENCY ESCORT

13:56.044 --> 13:57.921
You know what this is, don't you?

13:58.004 --> 14:02.717
This is the report of the GMI Bank Case,
which you investigated yourself.

14:03.510 --> 14:04.886
INVESTIGATION REPORT

14:04.970 --> 14:07.430
And this is the report that we found

14:07.514 --> 14:09.808
on a computer from your uncle's company.

14:12.310 --> 14:14.938
What do you think? Looks the same, right?

14:15.981 --> 14:17.649
According to the security check,

14:17.732 --> 14:21.278
it seems definite that this file
has been leaked from your office.

14:26.616 --> 14:27.826
ATTACHED FILE
JANG TAE-CHUN.PDF

14:27.909 --> 14:28.910
SEND

14:30.537 --> 14:33.248
Prosecutor Jang, you know keeping quiet

14:33.331 --> 14:35.458
isn't going to help your situation.

14:36.167 --> 14:37.168
I know.

14:37.877 --> 14:41.256
I know that there's no use,
even if I list you the names

14:43.008 --> 14:46.011
of those who received those bribes!

14:46.970 --> 14:48.471
I am very well aware.

14:49.639 --> 14:50.640
Jeez.

14:51.808 --> 14:55.770
I guess his insolence was to be expected,
given that he's from a no-name university.

14:56.813 --> 15:01.484
Even so, if you corner him this far,
Eun Yong won't just sit back and watch.

15:02.611 --> 15:05.238
This is going to be a problem
for my kids' school too.

15:05.322 --> 15:08.617
If he tells everyone about the meeting
at the Supreme Office, it'll be trouble.

15:10.577 --> 15:13.747
Well, Chef Hwang
said he'd take care of it.

15:13.830 --> 15:15.624
So let's see what happens.

15:15.707 --> 15:18.585
If there aren't any results
within three days,

15:18.668 --> 15:20.962
Assemblyman Baek
will bring Hwang down anyway.

15:25.300 --> 15:27.260
That cheeky bastard.

15:28.553 --> 15:30.221
This flash drive contains

15:30.305 --> 15:34.059
the original copy of the fabricated file
you gave Hwang Gi-seok?

15:34.142 --> 15:37.437
Yes, it's the piece of evidence
submitted to prosecution back then.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.356
The list of Bluenet's recovered debts.

15:41.358 --> 15:43.652
I took the flash drive
from the company safe.

15:43.735 --> 15:46.363
In it, there was a ledger account,
saved as an excel file.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.239
2009 SEPTEMBER 8,
CEO PARK, 50 MILLION WON

15:49.324 --> 15:52.952
Next to the 50 million won expense,
I changed the name to Minister Son

15:54.579 --> 15:56.665
as per Hwang Gi-seok's instructions.

15:57.832 --> 16:00.085
SEPTEMBER 30, 2009
BLUENET CEO YOON HYE-RIN

16:03.588 --> 16:06.633
I've attached a statement from
Chuho University's forensic service,

16:06.716 --> 16:08.051
confirming it's the original.

16:08.134 --> 16:12.514
An internationally approved institution,
it has the same legal power as the NFS.

16:12.597 --> 16:14.974
Are you ready for
the second press conference?

16:15.058 --> 16:19.062
We'll blow this up in three days
according to the party leader's schedule.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.064
Then we'll file a suit.

16:21.147 --> 16:24.025
The National Assembly will audit,
appoint special prosecutors.

16:24.109 --> 16:26.486
We'll do everything we can to corner them.

16:26.569 --> 16:29.823
We love this strong support
with the election just around the corner.

16:31.199 --> 16:34.744
The likes of Hwang Gi-seok
who plays dirty and sly

16:34.828 --> 16:38.998
must be brought down
so that our country can stand tall.

16:39.082 --> 16:43.753
It's how we can get CEO Eun released.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.340
-I'm meeting the guard here?
-Yes.

17:29.424 --> 17:30.759
Wait here for a minute.

17:31.926 --> 17:34.429
What? What's going on? Officer!

17:35.555 --> 17:36.556
What are you…

17:36.639 --> 17:38.349
What is… Hey!

18:03.875 --> 18:05.084
Welcome.

18:06.961 --> 18:09.214
I think I'll be out of here
before the weekend.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.385
It's all thanks to you.

18:19.557 --> 18:21.559
I'm sorry you can't come with.

18:22.435 --> 18:23.812
So when I leave,

18:23.895 --> 18:27.232
I'm going to hold your hand tight!

18:29.651 --> 18:30.693
Don't you worry.

18:30.777 --> 18:33.404
The saw blade is sharp,
so it'll be a neat cut!

18:40.370 --> 18:42.455
-Fuck!
-My goodness, sir!

18:52.549 --> 18:53.675
Move!

19:02.725 --> 19:04.060
You little shit!

19:05.562 --> 19:06.896
Finish him!

19:22.871 --> 19:24.330
You bastard!

19:34.841 --> 19:35.842
Stay down!

19:38.469 --> 19:40.096
Damn it!

20:19.344 --> 20:20.887
Bring it on.

20:25.642 --> 20:27.060
Bring it.

20:28.019 --> 20:29.354
Bring it on!

20:34.859 --> 20:36.069
You crazy fucker.

20:36.152 --> 20:39.030
Gosh, this bastard.
You're quite persistent, you know that?

21:08.726 --> 21:10.853
Inmate 4816. Are you feeling okay?

21:19.153 --> 21:23.116
Gosh, I was gone for a bit
and look what happened.

21:24.283 --> 21:28.454
The guy you stabbed in the workshop,
inmate 101, died last night.

21:31.124 --> 21:32.125
What?

21:46.014 --> 21:47.098
Hello?

21:47.181 --> 21:48.391
What were you doing not picking up?

21:48.474 --> 21:51.102
What do you think?
I got suspended, so I slept in.

21:52.228 --> 21:54.439
Your uncle just murdered
an inmate in jail!

21:54.522 --> 21:55.523
What?

21:56.899 --> 22:00.820
One of the inmates who fought Yong
died at the workshop.

22:00.903 --> 22:04.073
The murder weapon, a screwdriver,
had Yong's fingerprints on them.

22:04.157 --> 22:06.200
What about Yong's testimony?

22:06.284 --> 22:08.494
Obviously, he said he didn't do it.

22:08.578 --> 22:10.079
He said he was the one who got attacked,

22:10.163 --> 22:12.915
and when he pulled himself together,
the inmate was already dead.

22:12.999 --> 22:15.710
He says Kim Seong-tae wore gloves
to frame him.

22:15.793 --> 22:17.587
That bastard stabbed him in the neck.

22:17.670 --> 22:19.213
The screwdriver was in the neck and…

22:19.297 --> 22:21.174
He suddenly came in
and stabbed him in the neck.

22:21.257 --> 22:23.676
When I came to my senses,
blood was dripping from it.

22:23.760 --> 22:27.055
All other prisoners at the scene
are pointing at your uncle.

22:27.930 --> 22:30.850
Wait, they're working together?

22:30.933 --> 22:34.353
Well, yeah.
They're all under Kim Seong-tae.

22:34.896 --> 22:37.899
I think this was all planned.

22:37.982 --> 22:41.861
We're at a complete disadvantage here
due to the prints and witnesses.

22:41.944 --> 22:44.489
The blackmailing of CEO Oh
isn't the issue anymore.

22:44.572 --> 22:46.240
He's going to be a convicted murderer!

22:47.158 --> 22:49.786
Do you think I can get
the police investigation report?

22:50.578 --> 22:52.205
Where are you? I'll meet you there.

22:57.001 --> 22:59.045
Who is the detective in charge?

22:59.128 --> 23:01.339
I'm on my way to meet him right now.

23:01.422 --> 23:03.174
Okay. I'll head over right away.

23:17.522 --> 23:18.815
This is Jang Tae-chun.

23:21.734 --> 23:22.735
What?

23:53.724 --> 23:55.935
Nice to meet you. I'm Myung Se-hui.

23:56.769 --> 23:59.522
MYUNG SE-HUI
YORIGA, FOOD RESEARCHER

24:00.439 --> 24:02.316
What did you want
to tell me about my uncle?

24:03.693 --> 24:07.196
You don't look like him,
but you're just as impatient.

24:09.198 --> 24:10.199
Why don't we go in?

24:23.337 --> 24:25.756
This is puffer fish stew
stirred in clam broth.

24:32.013 --> 24:33.014
No, thank you.

24:33.973 --> 24:35.391
You seem so gaunt though.

24:35.933 --> 24:39.020
I heated it up, so at least try the soup.

24:41.856 --> 24:42.857
Well, then.

24:49.822 --> 24:51.407
Manager Eun…

24:51.490 --> 24:55.244
He's the kindest out of all the people
who worked under my dad.

24:57.163 --> 25:00.458
Oh, you do know who I am, right?

25:02.919 --> 25:08.674
Yes, I am well aware of
who your father and husband are.

25:08.758 --> 25:10.218
That's why I want to help.

25:10.885 --> 25:13.304
I want to clear him
of the false murder charge.

25:13.971 --> 25:16.515
False charge?
Did you just say false charge?

25:18.601 --> 25:20.269
It's obviously a false charge.

25:20.353 --> 25:24.565
There's no way a kind person like him
would kill anyone.

25:27.193 --> 25:28.861
How are you going to help us?

25:38.663 --> 25:41.374
The original copy Park Joon-gyeong has.

25:41.999 --> 25:43.834
That's all I need.

25:49.924 --> 25:52.260
Bring it to me
before it gets to Assemblyman Baek.

25:53.678 --> 25:56.764
Then my husband will take care
of yesterday's incident.

25:58.182 --> 25:59.558
How can we trust her?

26:00.476 --> 26:01.894
If you can trust her,

26:02.561 --> 26:04.814
would you accept the deal?

26:05.731 --> 26:08.067
If you are willing,
then I'll negotiate with her.

26:08.901 --> 26:10.528
So that we'll have leverage.

26:12.863 --> 26:15.241
You both know how my mother died.

26:15.825 --> 26:17.994
I can't repeat the same mistake again.

26:18.077 --> 26:19.996
I'm not negotiating with Hwang.

26:20.079 --> 26:21.956
Then what about CEO Eun?

26:22.039 --> 26:24.458
We can cope with losing the company.

26:24.542 --> 26:26.460
But if he's facing a homicide charge--

26:26.544 --> 26:28.212
He'll be sentenced to at least ten years.

26:29.255 --> 26:32.925
Ten years is the minimum.
Are you still going to leave him be?

26:33.509 --> 26:35.136
The truth must be revealed.

26:35.219 --> 26:37.471
That's what got us here!

26:38.514 --> 26:40.474
I've seen this happen countless times.

26:40.558 --> 26:44.478
If we don't act on time,
he might really get a 10-year sentence!

26:44.562 --> 26:46.397
I specifically told Yong.

26:47.648 --> 26:49.859
That we'll take this to the end
no matter what.

26:49.942 --> 26:52.153
Don't you think you're being selfish?

26:54.030 --> 26:55.156
Yes, I am selfish.

26:56.407 --> 26:59.160
I have another appointment,
so I'll get going.

27:02.330 --> 27:04.415
She has an appointment
in the midst of all this?

27:05.166 --> 27:06.292
Hey, Jang Tae-chun.

27:06.917 --> 27:08.711
Don't you think she's being absurd?

27:12.506 --> 27:14.550
I'll meet with the detective in charge

27:15.551 --> 27:17.345
and keep you updated on the situation.

27:30.024 --> 27:31.233
Let's go.

27:32.443 --> 27:34.320
-Have you eaten?
-Yes.

27:36.739 --> 27:37.823
-Hello.
-Oh, hello.

27:38.741 --> 27:41.744
A HAPPY COUNTRY,
A JUST PROSECUTION

27:42.453 --> 27:43.829
Hey!

27:49.377 --> 27:52.963
The sitter couldn't make it
because she has enteritis.

27:53.589 --> 27:54.715
All of a sudden, this morning.

27:56.592 --> 27:57.843
But what can I do?

27:57.927 --> 27:59.387
So I came to work with my baby again.

28:00.554 --> 28:03.140
You happy?
Are you happy to feel the breeze?

28:03.224 --> 28:05.476
Have you read the investigation report?

28:05.559 --> 28:06.644
I did.

28:07.353 --> 28:09.647
You've never asked me favors
regarding a case before.

28:09.730 --> 28:11.982
So I found it strange
and read it right away.

28:13.192 --> 28:14.193
But…

28:16.070 --> 28:18.280
I told you the backstory of the incident.

28:18.864 --> 28:20.991
This is a trap. It's a false charge.

28:21.075 --> 28:23.661
Yeah. It's all because of that son of…

28:27.289 --> 28:28.290
That bastard.

28:28.874 --> 28:32.378
get that Hwang is connected to all this.

28:33.045 --> 28:36.799
But it's hard to turn the tables around
when his prints were found on the weapon.

28:37.383 --> 28:39.844
But the witness statements

28:39.927 --> 28:42.805
all sounded the same,
like it was a concocted story.

28:45.683 --> 28:47.393
Gosh, what's wrong, Da-in?

28:48.853 --> 28:50.604
Why? Did you poo poo?

28:51.313 --> 28:52.690
No, you didn't.

28:53.816 --> 28:56.110
You just ate earlier. Come on.

28:56.193 --> 28:57.987
It's been a hectic day for you.

28:58.988 --> 29:00.239
Please, I'm begging you.

29:00.823 --> 29:03.117
Can you read over it thoroughly
just once more time?

29:05.995 --> 29:08.247
Are you saying
I didn't read the case properly

29:09.582 --> 29:12.042
because I came to work pushing a stroller?

29:12.126 --> 29:14.462
No. That's not what I meant.

29:14.545 --> 29:17.465
It's fine. I hear it often.

29:18.924 --> 29:20.551
Da-in.

29:20.634 --> 29:23.929
Let's say goodbye to her and go back in.

29:25.264 --> 29:26.390
Thanks for the coffee.

29:40.321 --> 29:47.036
NORTHWEST CHEONAN
POLICE STATION

29:47.119 --> 29:48.579
You've already met him?

29:49.288 --> 29:52.958
I read the investigation report,
but I don't see a way out.

29:53.042 --> 29:54.168
What about the CCTV?

29:56.795 --> 29:58.380
Isn't there CCTV everywhere in jail?

29:58.464 --> 29:59.757
They keep track of everything.

29:59.840 --> 30:02.760
It is everywhere.
But some weren't even working.

30:02.843 --> 30:05.262
The backdoor CCTV
to the workshop was completely broken.

30:05.846 --> 30:07.556
Gosh, seriously.

30:11.268 --> 30:14.855
Goodness. Slow down. Have some food too.

30:15.523 --> 30:17.525
Drinking fast can upset your stomach.

30:22.738 --> 30:23.739
Chief.

30:25.449 --> 30:27.117
What do we do about my uncle?

30:28.327 --> 30:29.328
Oh, man…

30:29.954 --> 30:31.330
He's from your maternal side?

30:32.957 --> 30:34.458
You two seemed very close.

30:43.551 --> 30:44.802
Chief…

30:46.720 --> 30:48.138
I lied to you.

30:49.682 --> 30:50.683
My mom.

30:52.726 --> 30:55.020
She wasn't a housekeeper.
She worked at a bar.

30:55.729 --> 30:57.481
She worked at a teahouse before that.

31:04.863 --> 31:07.116
Your mother must've had it tough.

31:08.242 --> 31:10.536
She did indeed.

31:13.956 --> 31:15.583
That's why I liked when my uncle visited.

31:16.333 --> 31:18.419
I always hung out
with my mom's lady co-workers.

31:19.003 --> 31:22.715
But I felt proud when he visited.
We walked around town, holding hands.

31:23.299 --> 31:25.593
My uncle always said he'd be my dad.

31:27.219 --> 31:29.388
In a way, he was my dad.

31:30.139 --> 31:33.642
When my uncle came to visit,
I felt like I had a father.

31:35.227 --> 31:36.770
We have family members like that.

31:37.730 --> 31:40.024
Those more parental
than your biological ones.

31:40.107 --> 31:41.942
Those you're closer to than your siblings.

31:42.651 --> 31:45.738
I knew it. I knew you could relate.

31:48.782 --> 31:51.702
And I know very well
about living a life of agony

31:53.537 --> 31:55.831
because of such a family member.

32:18.437 --> 32:19.688
Joon-gyeong.

32:34.662 --> 32:35.996
Park Joon-gyeong.

32:37.039 --> 32:39.291
Please save my uncle.

32:40.626 --> 32:41.794
I beg you.

32:43.337 --> 32:44.630
I'm sorry.

32:47.508 --> 32:49.468
You're not the only one in pain!

32:55.641 --> 32:57.101
You're not the only one.

33:02.481 --> 33:04.858
My mom had me when she was 19.

33:04.942 --> 33:07.903
She worked at a bar her whole life
and got dementia at 40.

33:10.739 --> 33:12.741
You know why I became a prosecutor?

33:13.409 --> 33:15.869
The sons of bitches
who looked down on my mom.

33:16.453 --> 33:19.123
The bastards who scorned us
for being a widow and an orphan.

33:19.206 --> 33:21.125
I wanted to put them all behind bars.

33:21.959 --> 33:26.463
Those pricks who step all over
the weak and impoverished.

33:27.005 --> 33:30.968
I wanted to show them that
Oh Bong-sun's son,

33:31.051 --> 33:33.512
that the Madame Eun's son,
had become a prosecutor

33:33.595 --> 33:35.931
and was ready
to lock all those criminals up!

33:36.014 --> 33:37.516
That was my dream!

33:39.059 --> 33:42.479
That's exactly what we're doing right now.

33:45.482 --> 33:46.734
But Joon-gyeong.

33:48.819 --> 33:50.654
Saving my uncle should come first.

33:50.738 --> 33:54.366
I'm all for vengeance, justice, and law.

33:54.450 --> 33:57.035
But family comes first before all that!

33:57.119 --> 33:59.246
Get a grip, you fool!

33:59.872 --> 34:03.584
You think striking a deal with them
will save your uncle?

34:05.002 --> 34:06.503
You have no idea!

34:07.755 --> 34:09.548
You've no idea how I lost my mom!

34:11.633 --> 34:12.968
No deals will be made.

34:13.677 --> 34:15.053
I will not give up either.

34:16.388 --> 34:17.639
I will get my revenge

34:18.807 --> 34:20.017
and I'll save Yong.

35:10.526 --> 35:13.028
Hey, working at the dinner table tells me

35:13.111 --> 35:15.364
you're not so efficient at work.

35:15.447 --> 35:17.991
-I just have a lot to do.
-Gosh.

35:20.160 --> 35:22.287
-Hey!
-Fine.

35:23.205 --> 35:26.583
Seriously. You're so boring.

35:26.667 --> 35:29.920
We're the only ones in this house.

35:30.003 --> 35:31.672
Call Yong.

35:32.631 --> 35:33.966
He's not even in Korea.

35:36.093 --> 35:37.845
He doesn't even contact you?

35:40.055 --> 35:41.765
He must be busy making money.

35:43.183 --> 35:44.768
I loved it when Yong was here.

35:44.852 --> 35:47.354
He lightened up the mood
and made it feel like home.

35:48.355 --> 35:51.316
Even if I offered to treat him
to some rib eye steak,

35:51.400 --> 35:54.069
he always said my jjigae was the best.

35:57.865 --> 35:59.825
I wanted to ask you something
for a long time.

35:59.908 --> 36:03.370
What made you bring him home
when you first saw him at the station?

36:04.204 --> 36:06.915
He was an orphan and ex-con.

36:06.999 --> 36:11.003
He's not the type
people offer to be their guardian.

36:12.546 --> 36:16.383
When I bring in people for questioning,
my first impressions are always wrong.

36:17.342 --> 36:19.261
I didn't know either.

36:19.344 --> 36:22.639
I just tried to make my best effort.

36:24.141 --> 36:25.225
Best effort?

36:25.934 --> 36:27.436
As an adult.

36:28.228 --> 36:31.189
He fought alongside you.

36:31.273 --> 36:33.275
I'll be that guardian.

36:33.358 --> 36:37.905
He would've been alone again,
if I didn't become his guardian.

36:41.950 --> 36:45.579
This fight isn't for you to fight alone.

36:46.496 --> 36:48.165
Your mom was like family to me.

36:49.541 --> 36:50.751
You and I,

36:51.501 --> 36:52.836
we're on the same team.

37:06.016 --> 37:08.477
Happy birthday to you

37:08.560 --> 37:10.979
Happy birthday to you

37:11.063 --> 37:13.941
Happy birthday, Dear Mom

37:14.024 --> 37:17.861
Happy birthday to you

37:19.613 --> 37:21.406
Left foot, right foot.

37:21.490 --> 37:25.494
-Up three times.
-You suck at this, Yong.

38:12.708 --> 38:13.959
Gosh.

38:15.085 --> 38:16.086
Wow.

38:16.169 --> 38:18.255
IMPLEMENTING LAW AND ORDER
CORRECTIONS DEPARTMENT

38:18.964 --> 38:21.967
I mean,
smell the difference in the air quality?

38:22.050 --> 38:24.011
Walls sure keep us cooped up.

38:24.094 --> 38:28.056
Sir, why don't we go out for some booze?

38:29.141 --> 38:31.226
Gosh! You must be out of your mind.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.812
You know how much money
I spent to get both of us out?

38:33.895 --> 38:35.022
You trying to be funny?

38:36.481 --> 38:37.566
Follow me in your car!

38:37.649 --> 38:39.860
We have a ton of work to do
back at the office.

38:47.117 --> 38:48.160
Gosh.

38:50.996 --> 38:52.539
Great work, sir.

38:53.915 --> 38:56.418
Oh, you're here.

38:56.501 --> 38:58.420
I thought you'd be busy
serving your country.

39:11.641 --> 39:13.852
I went to a funeral.

39:13.935 --> 39:17.939
A funeral? Did someone die?

39:18.857 --> 39:20.817
CEO Oh's funeral.

39:20.901 --> 39:22.694
Oh, right.

39:25.197 --> 39:26.948
That old man did leave us.

39:27.991 --> 39:31.745
He'll be moved to his burial tomorrow.
Would you like to visit?

39:31.828 --> 39:33.455
No, it's fine.

39:34.206 --> 39:37.167
You and I paid money
to express our condolences anyway.

39:38.543 --> 39:40.295
Did you take care of your situation

39:40.378 --> 39:43.006
by connecting Eun Yong to it?

39:43.090 --> 39:45.425
Yes, thanks to your care.

39:46.301 --> 39:49.721
We still have to wrap up
the past incident on CEO Yoon.

39:49.805 --> 39:52.057
But Baek is working with Park, so…

39:53.141 --> 39:54.142
I see.

39:56.686 --> 40:00.482
The late CEO Yoon's daughter,
she isn't someone to take lightly.

40:01.441 --> 40:04.444
We've offered Prosecutor Jang a deal
through my wife.

40:04.528 --> 40:06.738
But we're also coming up with a plan B.

40:07.531 --> 40:08.532
Good.

40:10.283 --> 40:11.284
As you should.

40:21.378 --> 40:22.546
NEULPUREUN HOSPITAL

40:34.307 --> 40:37.477
Yes, you should eat up
to live out your sentence for murder.

40:37.561 --> 40:38.895
Have your fill.

41:18.435 --> 41:19.686
I'm on my way.

41:20.187 --> 41:23.023
BAEK IN-SU PRESS CONFERENCE

41:23.106 --> 41:24.816
We're all ready here.

41:46.755 --> 41:49.090
ASSEMBLYMAN BAEK IN-SU
PRESS CONFERENCE, 10:00 A.M.

41:59.768 --> 42:02.646
The original copy
that Park Joon-gyeong has.

42:02.729 --> 42:04.856
That's all I need.

42:08.818 --> 42:11.238
Bring it to me
before it gets to Assemblyman Baek.

42:11.821 --> 42:15.283
Then my husband will take care
of yesterday's incident.

43:23.310 --> 43:24.311
Damn!

43:28.064 --> 43:29.232
Get her!

43:35.739 --> 43:37.365
Where's your flash drive?

43:37.449 --> 43:39.409
Where the hell is it? Huh?

43:39.492 --> 43:40.785
Where is it?

43:41.745 --> 43:42.954
Cops!

44:10.565 --> 44:12.901
BAEK IN-SU PRESS CONFERENCE

44:13.610 --> 44:14.986
When will it start?

44:15.737 --> 44:16.738
-Gosh.
-When is…

44:16.821 --> 44:19.240
-You should at least…
-How much longer?

44:19.324 --> 44:20.658
When is it starting?

44:21.284 --> 44:23.495
Is the press conference today?

44:23.578 --> 44:25.038
What a waste of my time.

44:25.121 --> 44:26.122
Sir.

44:29.959 --> 44:33.671
You still can't get a hold of
Park Joon-gyeong?

44:33.755 --> 44:36.091
No. She's not picking up her phone.

44:37.801 --> 44:40.011
What the hell is she up to?

44:53.608 --> 44:54.692
What?

45:02.992 --> 45:05.203
But aren't you the prosecutor

45:05.286 --> 45:07.705
who teamed up with Hwang Gi-seok
by selling me out?

45:08.289 --> 45:11.918
How funny.
You stab me, then give me kisses.

45:12.001 --> 45:16.631
If you don't want to get stabbed again,
make sure you pull this off.

45:17.215 --> 45:20.969
-You arrogant little prick!
-Sir.

45:21.052 --> 45:24.597
Ms. Park was stabbed by masked men
and is on her way to the hospital.

45:26.015 --> 45:28.476
Penetration wound on the shoulder,
with severe blood loss.

45:28.560 --> 45:30.353
She has unstable vital signs.

45:30.437 --> 45:33.731
Prepare an IV infusion immediately
and request CS for an emergency operation!

45:35.525 --> 45:36.776
Really?

45:38.570 --> 45:42.407
Gosh, all right.
Keep your head down for a while.

45:43.408 --> 45:46.619
Damn, this persistent bitch.

45:48.329 --> 45:50.498
Hey, Gi-seok. It's me.

45:51.583 --> 45:53.293
We need to move quickly.

46:00.008 --> 46:02.427
How is Park Joon-gyeong?
Is she badly injured?

46:02.510 --> 46:05.305
-Who are you?
-I'm a prosecutor from Seoul-- I mean.

46:05.847 --> 46:07.182
I'm her guardian.

46:07.265 --> 46:09.142
She lost a lot of blood
so she's in operation.

46:09.225 --> 46:10.351
We don't know the details.

46:10.435 --> 46:12.729
What about the assailants?
Did you catch them?

46:12.812 --> 46:15.356
Who the hell would stab someone
in broad daylight?

46:15.440 --> 46:18.026
The assailants fled the scene,
so we are investigating.

46:18.860 --> 46:19.861
Gosh.

46:19.944 --> 46:22.614
I would like to inform
that Assemblyman Baek's press conference,

46:22.697 --> 46:25.074
which was to be held at 10:00 a.m.,
has been canceled.

46:25.158 --> 46:28.161
I'd like to express my sincere apologies
to the reporters present at the venue.

46:28.244 --> 46:30.497
-Why was it canceled?
-Due to illegal recruitment of--

46:30.580 --> 46:33.166
Assemblyman Baek will hold
another press conference soon

46:33.249 --> 46:35.001
to give an explanation
for today's incident.

46:35.084 --> 46:36.336
Special Investigations will…

46:36.419 --> 46:37.837
Damn!

46:37.921 --> 46:40.006
Where is Assemblyman Baek at the moment?

46:40.089 --> 46:44.385
I'd like to offer my apologies once more
and conclude today's press conference.

46:44.469 --> 46:45.720
Yes, sir.

46:48.014 --> 46:52.685
I'll draft the indictment
so you can keep your seat in the Assembly.

46:57.106 --> 46:59.400
You don't have to worry
about the higher-ups.

47:00.235 --> 47:02.946
BAEK IN-SU PRESS CONFERENCE

47:10.411 --> 47:12.121
PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE
MEMORANDUM

47:12.205 --> 47:15.667
The redevelopment plan
that was terminated in your district,

47:16.334 --> 47:19.796
I will make sure to
fully compensate for the loss.

47:30.515 --> 47:34.143
-Better treat me to a drink too.
-Of course, sir. No need to ask.

47:34.769 --> 47:38.648
Just give me a date
and I'll serve you well.

47:43.861 --> 47:45.113
Thank you, sir.

47:50.451 --> 47:53.288
-My apologies, sir.
-Yeah.

47:54.622 --> 47:56.416
What took so long?

47:56.499 --> 47:59.210
A case has been resolved successfully,

47:59.294 --> 48:01.212
thanks to your patience, sir.

48:01.296 --> 48:02.463
Is that so?

48:03.172 --> 48:06.175
As prosecutors, it's satisfying
whenever that happens.

48:06.884 --> 48:08.136
You are right, sir.

48:08.219 --> 48:10.263
How do you like the chrysanthemum tea?

48:10.346 --> 48:11.931
Yes. It's nice.

48:13.641 --> 48:17.103
It's nice, but about the homicide
that happened in jail…

48:17.687 --> 48:19.397
Will you accuse him of homicide?

48:20.106 --> 48:24.569
Then he'll be sentenced to
at least ten years.

48:24.652 --> 48:26.487
If he admits to his crime,

48:26.571 --> 48:29.866
he'll get seven years on his first trial,
five years on his second,

48:29.949 --> 48:32.201
and three years on his third trial.

48:32.285 --> 48:36.080
This is your case, Attorney General.
It's my duty to make sure it goes well.

48:37.081 --> 48:39.626
Sounds great. Well done.

48:40.585 --> 48:41.794
I'm flattered, sir.

48:55.266 --> 48:56.768
I'm Detective Won Ji-a.

48:57.268 --> 48:59.771
Were you able to secure
the victim's dashcam?

48:59.854 --> 49:01.773
They're all wearing a mask,
so we can't tell.

49:01.856 --> 49:03.274
But there's one guy without a mask.

49:06.235 --> 49:07.570
Here.

49:11.991 --> 49:13.034
Hold on.

49:13.951 --> 49:16.871
-Who are you?
-I'm Prosecutor Jang Tae-chun.

49:22.377 --> 49:23.544
His name is Lee Jin-ho.

49:23.628 --> 49:26.923
He has a record
at the Buksan Juvenile Center in the '90s.

49:27.006 --> 49:30.051
Run a background check
and put an APB out for him right away.

49:36.808 --> 49:38.518
The guy who stabbed Joon-gyeong…

49:40.561 --> 49:41.646
was Jin-ho?

49:42.480 --> 49:44.857
Prosecutor Jang recognized his face.

49:45.566 --> 49:47.694
The police put him on the wanted list.

49:51.280 --> 49:53.199
Can I get out of this place now?

49:54.200 --> 49:55.952
I don't care how much it costs.

49:58.705 --> 50:00.289
If you admit to murder,

50:00.998 --> 50:03.126
you'll get three years for foul play.

50:04.127 --> 50:07.088
It's the final negotiation
Attorney Kim could reach with prosecution.

50:15.722 --> 50:17.014
Goodbye.

50:33.448 --> 50:35.575
LET'S LIVE A CHEERFUL,
AND ORDERLY LIFE

50:35.658 --> 50:37.994
EVIL BEGETS SIN,
GOOD BEGETS BLESSING

50:42.707 --> 50:47.170
If you lose your inner peace,
you cannot win in any fight.

50:50.548 --> 50:53.301
Every day, the capital market
is on the verge of collapsing

50:53.384 --> 50:55.636
forcing it into a chaotic hell.

50:57.096 --> 50:59.891
In this harsh, vicious battle for wealth,

50:59.974 --> 51:02.643
I always came out on top because I had…

51:03.811 --> 51:04.896
inner peace.

51:31.964 --> 51:33.800
But I don't need it anymore.

52:10.294 --> 52:11.671
-Hey, damn it.
-Let go!

52:12.380 --> 52:13.589
Let go!

52:14.423 --> 52:15.633
Damn you!

52:19.470 --> 52:20.513
Let go!

52:24.225 --> 52:25.351
Fuck!

52:31.315 --> 52:33.568
A battle with the beasts…

52:35.987 --> 52:38.281
is nothing short of hell on Earth.

54:11.540 --> 54:14.210
A MONTH LATER

54:27.682 --> 54:30.101
-She's still not awake?
-No.

54:30.935 --> 54:33.896
When in a coma due to blood loss,
they say a month is critical.

54:35.189 --> 54:37.441
You either wake up, stay as is,

54:38.025 --> 54:39.068
or die.

54:41.237 --> 54:45.157
My predecessor was in a coma
for half a year and passed away.

54:49.787 --> 54:51.580
Any progress in the investigation?

54:52.164 --> 54:55.167
We put out an APB for Lee Jin-ho,
as you said.

54:55.251 --> 54:57.586
As for Chairman Myung,
who you accused as the mastermind,

54:57.670 --> 55:01.048
the prosecution continues to refuse
issuing the warrants we requested.

55:02.758 --> 55:04.218
As expected.

55:05.052 --> 55:06.554
You're suspended for three months.

55:06.637 --> 55:09.432
The bastard who is refusing my requests
and has suspended you.

55:09.515 --> 55:10.891
It's the same guy, right?

55:10.975 --> 55:14.186
That Hwang whatever guy,
Chairman Myung's son-in-law?

55:18.649 --> 55:20.776
Please give me relevant information
regarding him.

55:21.402 --> 55:24.655
You can't investigate
because of your suspension anyway.

55:25.406 --> 55:26.407
Detective.

55:27.366 --> 55:29.201
You shouldn't
get involved in this fight either.

55:30.453 --> 55:32.496
This fight only goes two ways.

55:33.080 --> 55:35.041
You'll get laid off like me, or…

55:50.973 --> 55:55.352
ESTABLISHING LAW AND ORDER
OF HUMANE RESPECT

56:41.774 --> 56:44.735
You've been through a lot,
so let's drink something sweet.

56:45.319 --> 56:46.570
How is your injury?

56:47.947 --> 56:52.451
Now that you have to stay here,
try to play nice and get along, okay?

56:52.535 --> 56:54.829
If you get your sentence extended
for beating up

56:54.912 --> 56:58.791
a piece of trash like Kim Seong-tae,
the loss is yours.

57:03.462 --> 57:07.258
By the way,
I looked into you, Inmate 4816.

57:07.842 --> 57:10.594
You're a clever one
who used to handle large amounts of money.

57:11.971 --> 57:14.598
If you're willing to help me out,

57:14.682 --> 57:17.184
I'll make your stay here very comfortable.

57:19.186 --> 57:21.856
I'm not asking for a lot.

57:24.191 --> 57:25.860
All I need is some pocket change.

57:38.122 --> 57:39.415
HWANG GI-SEOK,
JUSTICE OF YEOUIDO,

57:39.498 --> 57:41.125
INVESTIGATES CORRUPTION OF
TOP THREE FIRMS

57:45.004 --> 57:48.048
Yeouido is taking a dive
while Special Investigations is soaring.

57:48.132 --> 57:50.426
Recently, you've been garnering
a lot of public support

57:50.509 --> 57:52.428
due to your investigation
against corruption.

57:52.511 --> 57:53.679
"Justice of Yeouido."

57:53.762 --> 57:56.307
Do you like that nickname?

57:56.390 --> 57:59.476
Of course, but, I mean, it's too much.

57:59.560 --> 58:01.729
I only did what I had to do.

58:01.812 --> 58:03.772
-I don't deserve it.
-Right.

58:03.856 --> 58:06.734
You said you only did your job.
That is easier said than done.

58:06.817 --> 58:09.653
But you went up against
the three biggest security firms.

58:09.737 --> 58:12.865
It must have been a big burden
for you to investigate them.

58:12.948 --> 58:14.867
-Any comments on that?
-Yes, it was a burden.

58:16.160 --> 58:18.204
That's why we need Special Investigations.

58:18.287 --> 58:21.373
A corruption case
short-selling stocks like this is

58:21.457 --> 58:25.920
a criminal offense that directly affects
the lives of independent investors.

58:26.003 --> 58:27.922
Recently, the magnates
of the capital market,

58:28.005 --> 58:30.841
institutional investors,
have shown serious moral hazards.

58:30.925 --> 58:32.009
Wow, nice shot!

58:32.092 --> 58:34.220
LEE JEONG-GEUN - CHAIRMAN
OF NAMSAN FINANCIAL GROUP

58:34.303 --> 58:35.930
Your swings are on point today, sir!

58:36.972 --> 58:39.975
-Are they?
-Yes. Your swing is amazing.

58:40.059 --> 58:42.019
And the air is amazing too!

58:43.687 --> 58:45.731
-By the way, Chairman Myung.
-Yes, sir.

58:45.814 --> 58:50.027
About the investment product you proposed
to Namsan Securities…

58:50.110 --> 58:52.446
Have you already read over it?

58:52.529 --> 58:56.909
Our employees on the strategy team
unanimously voted against the proposal.

58:56.992 --> 59:00.579
-So I don't think we will implement it.
-What did you say?

59:01.330 --> 59:04.875
Oh, the employees are against it?

59:06.502 --> 59:09.213
Gosh, this is going to be a problem.

59:11.757 --> 59:15.302
We'll point out some of the issues
so that you can revise it

59:15.386 --> 59:18.305
-and send it back to me…
-Look here, Chairman Lee.

59:19.556 --> 59:21.392
You sure you're thinking straight?

59:22.017 --> 59:25.521
You know the top three securities
in Korea are under a microscope right now

59:25.604 --> 59:27.314
due to corruption, right?

59:27.398 --> 59:30.276
Don't you think Namsan Securities
will be next in line

59:30.359 --> 59:32.403
as the fourth largest security firm?

59:32.486 --> 59:34.280
Gosh, seriously.

59:34.363 --> 59:37.533
But in this dangerous time,
what did you just say to me?

59:37.616 --> 59:39.410
Revise my proposal?

59:39.493 --> 59:40.536
Forget it!

59:40.619 --> 59:43.831
I fully understand what you mean.
So let's just drop the deal.

59:43.914 --> 59:45.624
Let's just forget about it.

59:48.085 --> 59:49.461
Gosh, Chairman Myung…

59:50.462 --> 59:53.424
-You should at least finish golfing!
-Damn it.

59:55.259 --> 59:56.885
Chairman Myung, gosh!

1:01:06.955 --> 1:01:08.707
Let's draw the line here.

1:01:08.791 --> 1:01:10.459
Or this time…

1:01:11.251 --> 1:01:13.087
want me to cut off your ankle?

1:01:14.755 --> 1:01:15.964
You bastard…

1:02:23.699 --> 1:02:25.033
Is it Hwang Gi-seok?

1:02:25.117 --> 1:02:28.454
The one who framed you
and made Joon-gyeong like that.

1:02:28.537 --> 1:02:29.746
Nothing is for certain.

1:02:30.789 --> 1:02:33.041
What is this place?
It looks like an abandoned building.

1:02:33.125 --> 1:02:34.793
It's like they say,

1:02:34.877 --> 1:02:36.253
the operation has commenced.

1:02:36.336 --> 1:02:38.380
It's the conclusion I came to
by following my heart.

1:02:39.548 --> 1:02:42.217
If I were Chairman Myung,
what choice would I have made?

1:02:42.301 --> 1:02:46.930
Inmate 4816, Eun Yong,
asked me to give this to you, sir.

1:02:47.014 --> 1:02:50.893
Because if you want an obedient dog,
you must first teach him who the owner is.

1:02:50.976 --> 1:02:53.645
I can send you to hell
in the blink of an eye.
