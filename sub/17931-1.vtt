01:53.894 --> 01:55.837
Help me!
Wait!

01:58.999 --> 02:00.495
No.....!

02:02.654 --> 02:03.984
No.....!

02:30.325 --> 02:32.425
Emma Alive.

03:00.502 --> 03:03.492
I don't know,
it's just not going to be the same.

03:03.852 --> 03:05.992
Trust me, it'll be the same.

03:09.837 --> 03:12.581
I'm going to miss everyone.

03:13.769 --> 03:15.769
It's life, Betty.

03:16.567 --> 03:19.839
Sometimes it's necessary to relocate.

03:20.129 --> 03:22.888
Don't make it seem like
it's not your fault.

03:23.646 --> 03:27.040
Out of every bad situation
comes something good.

03:27.063 --> 03:28.389
Don't you agree?

03:28.400 --> 03:30.609
You have a truely demented
way of looking at things.

03:30.634 --> 03:35.813
If I didn't, I don't think
you'd be so in love with me.

03:39.010 --> 03:40.836
Don't flatter yourself.

03:43.688 --> 03:47.514
I'm tired.
Let's stop somewhere for the night.

04:06.547 --> 04:09.871
Hey now. Please don't tell me
you're here for directions.

04:09.872 --> 04:12.497
I got fifteen rooms,
all with your name on it.

04:13.013 --> 04:17.397
The good news is, I know exactly where I'm going.
The bad news is, I only need one room.

04:17.398 --> 04:21.279
Well, I'll take what I can get.
I just need a credit card.

04:26.922 --> 04:29.514
Wow...  Pretty...  Young.

04:29.952 --> 04:32.352
- Just the way I like 'em.
- Yeah.

04:32.751 --> 04:34.818
Well, that's an unusual name.

04:36.426 --> 04:39.605
My father had an unforgiven
commitment to historical reference.

04:40.224 --> 04:42.874
Oh. Well, let's just get you fixed up, huh.

04:42.899 --> 04:48.129
How does number 8 sound to you?

04:49.036 --> 04:51.658
Infinity.
I like it.

<i>Israeli jet fighters bombed a guerilla
base killing at least forty nine soldiers</i>
27c
00:04:55,027 --> 00:04:56,691
<i>and thirteen civilians.</i>

04:57.027 --> 04:58.691
- Here it is again.
- <i>Up next,</i>

04:58.692 --> 05:03.163
<i>local law enforcement and the FBI
are scouring the area north of Spokane</i>

05:03.188 --> 05:06.762

them to missing heiress Emma Ward.</i>

05:06.763 --> 05:10.269
<i>From what we can tell,
the carving's about six months old.</i>

05:10.270 --> 05:12.717
<i>It reads "Emma Alive."</i>

05:12.742 --> 05:15.483
<i>It's impossible to get an accurate date,</i>

05:15.508 --> 05:19.291
<i>but tree growth on that particular

05:19.316 --> 05:22.337
<i>probably done in the Spring,

05:22.596 --> 05:25.094
<i>after her abduction.</i>

05:25.814 --> 05:27.670
Clever girl.

05:28.039 --> 05:29.951
You think?

05:30.655 --> 05:33.421
I don't think I would have
thought to do that.

05:34.399 --> 05:38.803
- Now she has a chance.
- There's always a chance.

05:42.537 --> 05:44.670
But you know how these
things turn out.

05:49.889 --> 05:51.736
Take off the towel.

06:10.156 --> 06:11.911
I'm sorry.

06:13.902 --> 06:15.923
I'm sorry for everything.

06:16.784 --> 06:20.215
The man who lacks emotion is sorry.

06:20.583 --> 06:22.877
I don't lack emotion,

06:24.878 --> 06:27.981
I just process it differently.

06:31.315 --> 06:34.900
Must everything about you
be different?

06:35.987 --> 06:40.142
- I like it "normal".
- I would change if I could, but I can't.

06:40.146 --> 06:42.048
I just can't.

06:50.079 --> 06:53.190
Just tell me that you love me 
more than her.

06:55.160 --> 06:58.109
I don't love her more than you.

06:58.946 --> 07:01.094
I never did.

07:02.658 --> 07:05.089
It was just different.

07:45.217 --> 07:47.174
Put some muscle in it.

07:48.448 --> 07:50.757
That's easy for you to say.

08:03.923 --> 08:08.389
You gotta be kiddin'. Jack,
can you do me a favor and go open the gate?

08:08.390 --> 08:09.997
Why?

08:09.998 --> 08:13.792
"Why"? Because the gate won't open,
I need you to open it, please.

08:14.966 --> 08:16.606
Thank you!

08:22.806 --> 08:24.650
Trouble, trouble!

08:26.226 --> 08:27.562
Hoag!

08:29.244 --> 08:31.340
Home sweet home.

08:39.615 --> 08:42.256
- Who are those guys?
- Honey?

08:44.811 --> 08:47.546
Mind my lead.
Let me do the talking.

08:47.799 --> 08:50.776
Talking? Don't you think it's
a little late for talking?

08:52.317 --> 08:54.364
Amy, give me...
give me the phone.

09:00.942 --> 09:02.240
Oh my God!

09:03.534 --> 09:04.961
No, Flynn!

09:06.277 --> 09:07.539
Flynn! What the fuck!

09:10.028 --> 09:11.746
Fuck... fuck, man!

09:12.718 --> 09:14.216
Motherfucker!

09:15.022 --> 09:16.992
- Enough!
- Damn it!

09:16.993 --> 09:18.993
Easy...

09:18.994 --> 09:21.809
- Your problem Flynn, is you don't fuckin' think.
- He had a phone!

09:21.834 --> 09:25.145
You have a phone,
should I shoot you?

09:29.723 --> 09:31.597
Every cop in the county
heard that racket.

09:31.598 --> 09:35.089
- You made a mess here, Flynn.
- Excuse me for saving our fucking asses.

09:35.293 --> 09:37.418
Mean, what did you think was gonna be happen?

09:37.453 --> 09:40.418
That we'd just we sit down and have
a cup of tea with the Cleavers?

09:40.419 --> 09:44.435
- You told us they are on vacation, Flynn!
- Well, now they're on permanent vacation.

09:44.460 --> 09:47.899
- Fuck this!
- This is so seriously fucked up.

09:47.924 --> 09:50.134
- Shit!
- Is he fuckin' crying?

09:50.159 --> 09:53.032
- Are you fuckin' crying?
- Look what you've done.

09:53.040 --> 09:55.864
- Ethan, let's shut it down.
- Shut it down?

09:55.865 --> 09:58.328
- Shut it down? What about all the...
- He said shut it down.

09:58.329 --> 10:01.106
Like we were never here.
Come on, let's go!

10:17.647 --> 10:19.150
I had to.

10:33.909 --> 10:35.495
I'm hungry.

10:36.270 --> 10:39.947
- So go eat.
- And leave you here alone?

10:40.002 --> 10:41.478
Right.

10:41.503 --> 10:43.839
Why don't you go have dinner
with your girlfriend?

10:44.770 --> 10:46.671
Would you be rational?

10:52.727 --> 10:55.151
I know what you were doing out there.

10:57.552 --> 10:59.235
You're wrong.

11:11.584 --> 11:14.034
Hey, where'd you suggest we eat tonight?

11:14.059 --> 11:16.059
Ah... let's see... Ah...

11:16.865 --> 11:21.085
Go up here about twenty miles,
and take a right on Highway 21.

11:21.110 --> 11:25.835
There's a place called <i>Helen's</i>.
Great food, delicious steaks.

11:25.860 --> 11:29.167
- Great, thanks.
- This ole boy treatin' you well?

11:32.706 --> 11:34.537
Alright, then.

11:34.640 --> 11:37.772
You kids enjoy yourselves,
and I'll see you when you get back.

11:46.914 --> 11:49.174
This is all about her, isn't it?

11:49.218 --> 11:52.132
Can you possibly imagine it
being about anybody else?

11:52.157 --> 11:55.257
Can we just enjoy
a pleasant dinner?

12:00.703 --> 12:03.594
Doesn't look like we'll
have trouble finding a table.

12:04.040 --> 12:07.063
Note to self:
Do not order the fish.

12:08.631 --> 12:13.527
- A-ha.  Sign of forgiveness?
- Don't get carried away.

12:23.733 --> 12:25.609
Get yourself comfortable.

12:26.212 --> 12:28.114
Sit anywhere you like.

12:28.597 --> 12:32.836
It's awful quiet these months.
Amber will be right with you.

12:33.220 --> 12:35.435
Amber! table!

12:37.750 --> 12:39.262
Hey there!

12:39.928 --> 12:43.669
I'm Amber.
Todays fish is a terrific John Dory,

12:43.694 --> 12:45.742
and the steak is an aged ribeye.

12:45.767 --> 12:48.276
Is it aged because no one orders it?

12:49.050 --> 12:53.046
Very funny.
Why don't I start you off with something to drink?

12:53.627 --> 12:55.220
Wine.

12:57.853 --> 13:00.174
- Shit...
- Helen, a pitcher.

13:06.859 --> 13:09.375
Where's your sense of humor, Hoag?

13:09.400 --> 13:14.485
I just have to... have my... my fun.

13:16.058 --> 13:20.141
- He's a total psychopath.
- I'm a team player!

13:21.590 --> 13:27.716
You, my friend, become a fuckin' liablity.
And my fuckin' wallet is empty.

13:28.689 --> 13:33.591
Ethan's right, today's on you.
Figure out a way to make it right.

13:33.610 --> 13:36.620
And maybe, we'll be friends again.

13:36.645 --> 13:38.463
True that.

13:39.904 --> 13:41.947
Are you mad at me also?

13:43.631 --> 13:51.154
'Cause if I have to take any shit from you today,
I gonna turn your fuckin' ballsack into a beany.

13:51.189 --> 13:52.877
- I'm just saying...
- Shut the fuck up!

13:52.878 --> 13:55.107
You can talk once you've put in your time.

14:06.369 --> 14:08.041
I gotta take a leak.

14:17.188 --> 14:19.546
Do not tell me you're
watching your weight.

14:21.093 --> 14:23.053
A girl's got to keep her figure.

14:24.618 --> 14:27.729
- You're crazy.
- Look who's talking.

14:30.369 --> 14:32.959
Hey.  You guys from around here?

14:38.740 --> 14:41.299
I think they're mutes.

14:42.448 --> 14:44.476
I think they're fucking mutes.

14:44.656 --> 14:46.044
God damn it.

14:48.579 --> 14:50.275
Just passing through.

14:50.722 --> 14:52.375
I see...

14:52.876 --> 14:55.793
- Are you moving?
- Relocating.

14:55.880 --> 14:58.967
Traveling with all
your worldly belongings?

14:59.319 --> 15:01.665
This is my only wordly belonging.

15:03.317 --> 15:05.255
Is that right?

15:06.467 --> 15:08.514
How much is she worth to you?

15:09.038 --> 15:12.062
- Please, we don't want any trouble.
- We'll just forget it, okay?

15:14.535 --> 15:17.139
If I wanted to hear from an asshole,

15:17.164 --> 15:18.997
I'd rip you a new one.

15:20.334 --> 15:21.970
Alright?

15:25.989 --> 15:28.090
The way I see it,

15:28.348 --> 15:32.008
Your girlfriend looks at me like
I'm the unsavory type.

15:32.775 --> 15:36.205
Like I'm someone you don't even
want to get to know.

15:36.784 --> 15:39.447
Uncouth perhaps, is that it?

15:47.739 --> 15:48.997
Don't.

15:50.722 --> 15:52.491
Yeah, don't.

15:52.666 --> 15:54.388
You're not the type.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.621
Trust me, I know the type.

16:04.162 --> 16:09.225
Don't mind my boy here. His idea of
friendliness is to scare the tourists.

16:09.678 --> 16:13.050
- Boo!
- Come on, lets go. Let's go.

16:13.817 --> 16:15.638
Please, excuse us.

16:17.467 --> 16:18.885
Move!

16:21.314 --> 16:25.464
Do not shit
where I eat.

16:53.800 --> 16:56.486
Am I really you're only wordly possession?

17:00.991 --> 17:02.906
Of all people,

17:03.434 --> 17:05.686
You should know I mean that I...

18:06.198 --> 18:08.914
What in fucks name is this?

18:09.748 --> 18:12.094
We can strip her down.
There's parts in here.

18:13.783 --> 18:18.006
And where pray tell is the
owner of this luxury vehicle?

18:18.207 --> 18:20.968
Convalescing at the gas station.

18:20.993 --> 18:26.061
After which,
Ethan will encourage him to cooperate.

18:26.086 --> 18:29.774
I told you, I don't like to get
my brother involved in your shit.

18:29.799 --> 18:34.452
The guy's is some upitty rich motherfucker
who was at the right place at the right time.

18:34.477 --> 18:37.031
All it's gonna take is a little bit of torture 

18:37.032 --> 18:39.876
and we'll have bank codes,
pin numbers and all sorts of shit.

18:40.174 --> 18:43.118
Kidnapping tourists is
your idea of fast cash?

18:43.495 --> 18:46.942
Did I not just make up for the short haul?

18:46.967 --> 18:49.037
Why don't you get off my fucking ass?

18:49.062 --> 18:54.171
Flynn, another fuck up like today
and I end you. Clear?

19:30.359 --> 19:33.907
- Where are we?
- The last place on earth.

19:35.645 --> 19:37.184
Oh, a comedian.

19:37.817 --> 19:39.706
This seem funny to you?

19:53.756 --> 19:55.475
Have they hurt you?

19:57.048 --> 19:58.815
What do you think?

20:08.815 --> 20:10.811
I've made a decision.

20:14.028 --> 20:15.687
Please, forgive me.

20:17.230 --> 20:19.038
No talking, sweetness.

20:43.492 --> 20:45.462
I can't do this anymore.

20:45.487 --> 20:47.725
I said, shut up.

20:47.992 --> 20:52.420
- Betty, don't.
- It's been an experience.

21:01.168 --> 21:02.389
What the fuck?

21:04.556 --> 21:05.933
Oh, my God.

21:05.958 --> 21:08.877
I'll see you in the next life.

21:08.902 --> 21:10.388
No.

21:12.712 --> 21:14.739
No..............!

21:14.764 --> 21:16.170
What the fuck?

21:25.438 --> 21:26.948
What the... fuck.

21:27.730 --> 21:29.224
Get away from her.

21:36.973 --> 21:40.019
Betty?

21:50.697 --> 21:52.494
You're dead, fucker.

22:00.189 --> 22:01.437
Shit!

22:10.589 --> 22:15.354
That's where you're mistaken.
But this, should clear up the confusion.

22:24.695 --> 22:28.531
Here it comes.
That was your first mistake.

22:29.360 --> 22:32.213
You people never heard of zip ties?

22:47.987 --> 22:51.763
Come on. Can I get some
fuckin' help here, please?

22:51.788 --> 22:54.576
It's too late for this fucking shit, Flynn.

22:55.070 --> 22:59.504
- What the fuck is that?
- This is a girl that I found in the fucking trunk.

22:59.529 --> 23:01.729
Fuck, she smells like a fucking toilet!

23:02.074 --> 23:05.148
Alright...Alright...Alright.
Hold still. Alright.

23:05.235 --> 23:08.315
I'm gonna take this off,
You're gonna stand still.

23:08.465 --> 23:10.119
Alright. Take it slow.

23:11.340 --> 23:13.820
- Look...  Bite me?
- Fuck!

23:23.822 --> 23:25.733
What the hell's all that yelling?

23:26.133 --> 23:28.251
There's a world of shit
erupting downstairs.

23:30.624 --> 23:32.122
It's 2:30 in the morning.

23:32.248 --> 23:35.608
There's some girl down there screaming,
like she's got bugs up in her.

23:35.633 --> 23:37.471
Bust my balls, Amber.

23:37.487 --> 23:40.431
Seems like Flynn carjacked that
couple from the restaurant.

23:40.432 --> 23:42.501
- Cut the shit!
- No, seriously.

23:42.830 --> 23:44.831
- I gotta check it out.
- No, you ain't gotta do nothin'.

23:44.832 --> 23:47.033
- Oh, I gotta go.
- No!

23:47.034 --> 23:48.385
I gotta go.

23:54.879 --> 23:56.707
What the fuck is going on?

23:58.960 --> 24:03.578
- Flynn found her in the trunk of the car.
- Where is he?  Where's is he?

24:03.632 --> 24:05.955
You killed him, right?
Please tell me he's dead.

24:06.018 --> 24:07.928
Expand on he.

24:08.265 --> 24:10.165
- Oh, God...
- What's going on?

24:10.166 --> 24:12.359
You have to get out of here...

24:12.384 --> 24:13.852
We have to.

24:13.877 --> 24:16.918
Get Ethan on the radio,
now... now... go!

24:16.943 --> 24:20.235
No, we have to leave now!
We have to get out from here now!

24:20.385 --> 24:24.235
- Why won't you let me go?
- What were you doing in the trunk of that car?

24:24.260 --> 24:27.563
Answer him!  Answer him!

24:27.588 --> 24:30.582
He had to move.
He knew they were coming, so he had to...

24:30.605 --> 24:33.895
- Who the fuck are we talking about?
- Listen to me. He's gonna come for me.

24:33.896 --> 24:36.298
- He always does.
- Why don't you start by telling us his name.

24:36.323 --> 24:40.287
He doesn't have a name.
He's gonna come and he's gonna kill you all!

24:40.288 --> 24:44.066
- Dad, Ethan's not coming up on the radio.
- Keep trying.

24:44.067 --> 24:47.210
You're not gonna get him.
You're not gonna get him, he's...

24:47.235 --> 24:49.837
- He's already dead.
- How the fuck do you know?

24:49.862 --> 24:51.995
Shut the fuck up, Flynn!

24:53.504 --> 24:55.638
Please,
just call the police!

24:56.483 --> 24:59.002
Are you people fucking retarded?

25:00.978 --> 25:05.040
Go up the road and
wake Ethan the fuck up.

25:05.041 --> 25:09.355
I'm going with him.
This Flynn show's gettin' under my skin.

25:19.634 --> 25:21.563
I'm sick of being disrespected.

25:21.564 --> 25:24.429
Denny, it's not a fuckin' book club.

25:24.430 --> 25:27.969
You earn your way around here.
If you want respect, you need to be grow a pair.

25:27.970 --> 25:29.259
Yeah, like Flynn?
248b
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:33,259
Flynn might be a scumbag,
but he's a loyal soldier.

25:33.260 --> 25:37.041
- And that means something.
- Well, I'm practically blood.

25:37.042 --> 25:40.021
Banging his little girl
doesn't buy you rights.

25:40.022 --> 25:43.684
Makes you brave though, considering
every dick in town's been in that shit.

25:43.685 --> 25:46.738
- This is my girlfriend you're talkin' about.
- God, Dens, please!

26:00.130 --> 26:01.881
Something's not right.

26:09.994 --> 26:11.762
Alright. Let's go.

26:17.712 --> 26:19.932
Ethan, you in here?

26:26.283 --> 26:28.841
What the fuck happened to the radio?

26:30.100 --> 26:32.021
Oh, fuck!

26:33.828 --> 26:36.436
What the fuck?  What the fuck!

26:45.920 --> 26:48.658
How the fuck did he kill Ethan?

26:48.659 --> 26:51.461
- Mother of God...
- Nobody kills Ethan!

26:52.464 --> 26:54.479
What the hell happened here?

26:55.248 --> 26:56.882
Oh, fuck!

27:13.193 --> 27:15.230
This is so wrong.

27:18.397 --> 27:21.120
Flynn really fucked up bad, didn't he?

27:21.793 --> 27:23.775
Looks that way.

27:34.859 --> 27:36.307
Fuck.

28:01.668 --> 28:04.562
Here. I think these should fit you.

28:17.140 --> 28:18.899
What's got into you girl?

28:19.267 --> 28:21.402
Maybe you should let her go now.

28:24.770 --> 28:28.226
Until we hear from Ethan,
I'm not lettin' that one outta my sight.

28:29.133 --> 28:33.263
I already told you...
He's dead.

28:33.764 --> 28:35.645
You don't know my brother.

28:37.575 --> 28:39.730
I never will.

28:45.745 --> 28:47.144
Push!

29:04.127 --> 29:06.083
What happened to you?

29:10.052 --> 29:11.746
What's your name?

29:28.495 --> 29:30.337
I have a question.

29:30.916 --> 29:33.454
Do you people have any idea
what you're dealing with?

29:33.479 --> 29:36.528
Where the fuck is the girl?
I told you not to let her out of your sight.

29:37.752 --> 29:41.603
You know how you guys always make fun of me
for watching all those  reality shows?

29:43.840 --> 29:45.950
Well, just wait till you see this.

29:47.377 --> 29:52.159
So, it's mostly just pedophiles and bank robbers,
guys who killed their families and shit.

29:52.160 --> 29:58.080
- But, I've been totally into this one story.
- Baby girl, don't be wasting my time.

29:58.105 --> 30:00.559
This one.

30:00.560 --> 30:02.567
That's you, right?

30:02.611 --> 30:05.809
<i>It was like any other Friday night
at the Oregon Art Complex.</i>

30:05.834 --> 30:10.480
<i>A night that would be seared into the mind
of parents of fifteen college students forever.</i>

30:10.481 --> 30:14.081
<i>Oregon student Emma Ward
and her friends were having a party</i>

30:14.082 --> 30:16.997
<i>celebrating the end of the semester,
like most students.</i>

30:16.998 --> 30:19.472
<i>Except this celebration turned bloody.</i>

30:19.473 --> 30:24.189
<i>A killer entered the house, was he
already there, waiting? Or was he a friend?</i>

30:24.190 --> 30:27.586
<i>Police and federal authorities have never
been able to place together the mystery of</i>

30:27.587 --> 30:30.396
<i>how or why it happened,
but when it was over,</i>

30:30.397 --> 30:33.031
<i>fourteen students
had been brutally murdered.</i>

30:33.032 --> 30:38.327
<i>Only one was never found, Emma Ward, the heiress
to the Nashville based Ward publication empire.</i>

30:38.328 --> 30:40.773
<i>Did she know the killer?
Until now, it was unclear.</i>

30:40.774 --> 30:42.993
<i>Thats when hunter Richard Luey
discovered this:</i>

30:42.994 --> 30:45.344
<i>I was trackin' a deer,
when it got caught up in this thing.</i>

30:45.345 --> 30:47.579
<i>Apparently the carving is
about eight months old.</i>

30:47.580 --> 30:50.841
<i>Lab test prove that this is
Emma Ward's blood on the glass.</i>

30:50.842 --> 30:55.199
<i>Now we must continue our investigation under
the premise that she is out there, somewhere.</i>

30:55.200 --> 30:58.278
<i>The Ward family is offering
a two million dollar reward</i>

30:58.279 --> 31:01.637
<i>for any information leading to
the recovery of their daughter.</i>

31:01.638 --> 31:05.585
<i>Up next: Kansas City authorities are still
searching for a 21 month old toddler</i>

31:05.610 --> 31:09.885
<i>after her sudden disappearence from her
home three weeks ago. American Crime.</i>

31:11.002 --> 31:12.818
Jackpot.

31:13.696 --> 31:17.572
- And the driver of the car?
- Is the maniac who did all that.

31:17.939 --> 31:20.924
I bet it's just payday,
written all across her face.

31:21.151 --> 31:23.123
Yeah, and a trail of heat from here to Oregon,

31:23.124 --> 31:26.736
hunting for the motherfucker
who kidnapped her.

31:27.623 --> 31:33.524
We're not talking about some
nickle and dime highway robbery bullshit.

31:34.384 --> 31:35.801
Emma...

31:36.091 --> 31:38.387
You know we're only here to help you, right?

31:45.035 --> 31:46.555
Hoag!

31:48.186 --> 31:49.721
A word...

31:49.880 --> 31:52.028
Stay here.

32:05.904 --> 32:08.275
I want this motherfucker found.

32:08.300 --> 32:11.605
We searched for the guy,
I think he hoffed it into the woods.

32:11.630 --> 32:14.167
Well, you didn't look hard enough.

32:15.035 --> 32:18.394
At least we know
he's not gonna go to the cops.

32:20.137 --> 32:24.311
The man who did this...
Doesn't forget...

32:24.336 --> 32:26.662
The man who crossed him,

32:26.999 --> 32:28.999
and neither do I.

32:31.570 --> 32:34.857
Get Ethan out of here.
Put him in the shed.

32:34.882 --> 32:36.937
We are gonna clean this mess up.

32:46.422 --> 32:49.824
Why are we the ones moving him
all over this fuckin' country?

32:49.825 --> 32:51.924
We should bury him proper.

32:52.306 --> 32:54.306
I ain't diggin' that hole.

33:02.188 --> 33:03.682
Jesus.

33:04.822 --> 33:07.734
That should keep the flies off him.

33:08.270 --> 33:10.438
Now go clean up the back of the van.

33:10.689 --> 33:12.923
That's bullshit, I picked him up.

34:12.905 --> 34:15.949
I told you,
you should have listened to me.

34:15.949 --> 34:19.226
I need to know exactly
what we're dealin' with.

34:19.226 --> 34:22.484
- Where's the girl? Betty?
- Dead.

34:22.907 --> 34:26.172
- Guess he was done with her.
- What?

34:26.197 --> 34:29.150
No, he would never do that,
not to her.

34:29.714 --> 34:32.434
Well, you guys fucked up,
you really fucked...

34:32.435 --> 34:37.136
Am I right in guessing your
friend will be heading our way?

34:38.262 --> 34:40.775
I am asking you a question.

34:47.283 --> 34:48.737
Stop her!

34:55.049 --> 34:59.600
Stop. Stop! Or it'll be your
brains runnin' down those stairs.

35:02.086 --> 35:04.496
Then you better
get yourself a mop.

35:13.028 --> 35:15.000
Hell, that's fine.

35:15.986 --> 35:20.392
My best hope of escape is while he's
killing the whole bunch of you.

35:22.503 --> 35:24.328
So I'll just wait.

36:23.291 --> 36:26.389
- You tellin' me that chick is worth two million?
- Yep.

36:26.790 --> 36:30.318
Denny, stop fucking counting the cash,
start loading the guns.

36:31.202 --> 36:34.638
Watch this bitch.
If she moves, waste her.

36:34.639 --> 36:39.702
Tamara, after we take off, lock this place down,
shoot anything that comes through the door.

36:39.703 --> 36:44.582
- Wait, what do you mean "we"?
- This prick is not gonna find himself, now is he?

36:44.583 --> 36:47.708
Shouldn't one of us hang back
and protect the girls?

36:47.709 --> 36:52.609
Nobody's hangin' back. We are hunting this
motherfucker, and we are gonna burn him down.

36:53.190 --> 36:56.444
- Wait, what, "as on fire"?
- It's a figure of speech, you idiot.

36:56.445 --> 36:57.853
Come on!

36:58.437 --> 37:00.941
I want that this motherfucker dead.

37:10.517 --> 37:11.917
Motherfucker!

37:14.312 --> 37:15.636
Shit!

37:23.126 --> 37:25.658
- You see him?
- Where the fuck are you?

37:28.532 --> 37:31.196
Come out and fight like a man, bitch!

37:41.874 --> 37:44.029
Fuck me, I'm fuckin' shot!

37:44.054 --> 37:47.379
- Denny! Denny!
- Am I fuckin' dying? Am I dying?

37:48.048 --> 37:50.994
- Fuck me, I can't believe it.
- There is hope.

37:50.995 --> 37:53.377
- Gone!
- Gone? Where's he mean "gone"?

37:53.378 --> 37:56.062
He's gone!
He got me!

37:57.511 --> 38:00.018
Fucking Flynn!
Give me some fucking help here!

38:00.714 --> 38:03.498
- What the fuck do I do?
- Come on, get up, get up.

38:04.775 --> 38:07.884
We're losing a ton of blood here,
get him to the couch.

38:10.750 --> 38:14.301
- Where's my Dad?
- I don't know, I don't know!

38:14.302 --> 38:16.958
- No, I...
- Let me look at it!

38:17.426 --> 38:20.918
It's just a flesh wound, alright man?
You're gonna be alright!

38:20.935 --> 38:25.241
- You're not goin' back out there!
- I'm not leavin' without Hoag.

38:27.011 --> 38:29.451
- Hoag is history.
- Fuck you, Flynn!

38:29.452 --> 38:32.634
- He wouldn't leave without you!
- In case you haven't noticed, he's everywhere.

38:32.635 --> 38:36.734
So if you want to get your sweet tits
and get shot off... be my guest!

38:58.300 --> 39:01.599
Motherfucker!
What's he doing?

39:02.608 --> 39:04.608
He's trapping us.

39:05.766 --> 39:08.214
If you had killed all those fucking people...

39:09.673 --> 39:11.414
Killed what people?

39:12.752 --> 39:15.536
- Killed what people?
- It doesn't concern you!

39:18.877 --> 39:22.111
Flynn, you might want to
drop the bad guy routine.

39:23.437 --> 39:28.673
I'm your path to living and you seem
to be bent on playing the dying game.

39:32.673 --> 39:35.691
Well then, we're gonna die together, bitch.

39:50.627 --> 39:53.582
So, what are you?
The leader here?

39:53.894 --> 39:59.894
You are playin' this all wrong. My people are
gonna find you and they are gonna fuckin' kill you!

40:00.041 --> 40:02.624
Who knows, you might all be heroes.

40:02.702 --> 40:05.952
Well, not you.

40:16.502 --> 40:21.400
You motherfucking cocksucker!
Fuck!

40:22.423 --> 40:25.688
It must be satisfying,
going from leader to martyr.

40:25.706 --> 40:27.430
Any thoughts?

40:31.673 --> 40:33.252
Hello...?

40:37.652 --> 40:39.652
I can get the girl for you.

40:39.840 --> 40:41.658
I can get the girl...

40:41.850 --> 40:45.679
- You can go on your way.
- No, no...

40:45.924 --> 40:49.753
You see, I'm planning on handling
that little task on my own.

40:50.073 --> 40:53.640
I thought you were gonna help me
get things back to the way they were.

40:53.667 --> 40:56.249
Can you do that?
Turn back time?

40:56.250 --> 40:58.771
- No.
- No.

40:58.798 --> 41:01.472
You know what I hate about
the common criminal?

41:01.917 --> 41:06.446
- They're so mediocre.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

41:06.462 --> 41:10.043
It's in mendacity
that we achieve our very best!

41:10.109 --> 41:13.503
- Is this your best?
- Fuck you!

41:13.504 --> 41:16.229
I'm not even close.

41:16.431 --> 41:19.900
You know who I am?
Who am I?

41:20.021 --> 41:24.423
Who - am - I?

41:24.445 --> 41:27.266
I don't know!
A serial killer?

41:28.627 --> 41:32.081
Serial killer?
Sweet Jesus, no.

41:32.638 --> 41:35.730
Serial killers deal in singularities,
I'm a numbers guy,

41:35.745 --> 41:39.000
which makes me,
a total psychopath.

41:39.086 --> 41:42.676
Maybe there are a few things
that may stereotype me.

41:42.677 --> 41:46.045
Fixations, rituals, trophies...

41:46.604 --> 41:48.748
Case in point.

41:49.210 --> 41:54.053
But what really motivates me,
is the absolute need to get the job done.

41:54.054 --> 41:56.198
How many are in the house?
Do the math, quick.

41:58.833 --> 42:01.568
- Five. There's five.
- Including my Emma?

42:01.735 --> 42:04.735
Or you're under the impression
she was one of you, huh?

42:06.594 --> 42:09.251
Okay, you've served your purpose.

42:13.899 --> 42:15.838
Any last words?

42:17.940 --> 42:21.122
- Wait...
- Concise...

42:21.155 --> 42:26.290
Not terribly clever, but the clarity
of the intention... Crystal clear.

42:26.672 --> 42:29.533
- However, no.
- No, please!

43:01.235 --> 43:03.952
I bet you want to kill
the man who did this to you.

43:03.953 --> 43:07.204
Your powers of perception
are staggering.

43:11.193 --> 43:12.713
Why you?

43:17.721 --> 43:21.494
I guess you could say,
he loves me.

43:21.505 --> 43:25.326
Today, we're going to advance to
something much more challenging.

43:25.944 --> 43:32.854
Let's meditate for a moment,
on the power you have over living things.

43:33.156 --> 43:37.211
The only thing keeping you here,
is me.

43:37.556 --> 43:41.805
Anything happens to me,
and you die.

43:44.440 --> 43:45.771
A fun fact.

43:45.794 --> 43:50.396
There are documented cases in
which prisoners found in cages

43:50.411 --> 43:53.176
long after their captors surrendered,

43:53.412 --> 43:58.373
left to their own
final desperate measures,

43:59.022 --> 44:02.089
actually cannibalized themselves.

44:04.605 --> 44:07.374
You know what the
technical term for that is?

44:07.567 --> 44:11.194
- Please, stop.
- Sarcophagy.

44:12.278 --> 44:13.696
Emma...

44:15.219 --> 44:17.433
Listen very carefully.

44:18.618 --> 44:21.281
When the arterial vein is sliced,

44:21.737 --> 44:25.107
The body tends to bleed out
within ten minutes.

44:25.794 --> 44:32.249
It's not like in the movies when someones'
jugular is severed and they immediately drop dead.

44:32.344 --> 44:34.091
No...

44:34.109 --> 44:38.059
But it's also impossible for the victim
to administer the proper medical help.

44:38.088 --> 44:41.090
- You know what that is?
- No.

44:41.608 --> 44:43.328
No biggie.

44:43.469 --> 44:45.840
I'm not a doctor either.

44:46.494 --> 44:49.161
I can tell you this much though.

44:49.798 --> 44:53.748
You elevate the wound above the heart
and you apply pressure to the area.

44:53.848 --> 44:57.086
And then you bandage tightly,
that's very important.

45:01.132 --> 45:03.530
Why are you telling me this?

45:06.073 --> 45:09.369
Because, no matter
how much you hate me,

45:09.931 --> 45:13.433
You now have the opportunity
to save my life.

45:40.743 --> 45:42.688
What's gonna happen to my Dad?

45:44.370 --> 45:48.739
- You and your Dad, you didn't get along.
- He wasn't the best role model.

45:50.619 --> 45:54.503
He's going to be tortured,
then killed.

46:01.806 --> 46:03.674
Why didn't he kill you?

46:04.026 --> 46:06.643
I think he was trying to create me.

46:07.588 --> 46:11.182
What did he do to you?
Did he hurt you?

46:20.953 --> 46:23.977
You should have run
while you had the chance.

46:30.199 --> 46:31.760
Alright.

46:32.434 --> 46:35.506
- Here, swallow this.
- I don't want to die.

46:35.766 --> 46:38.138
Just swallow this.
It'll take the edge off, alright.

46:39.533 --> 46:41.063
Good boy, good boy.

46:42.214 --> 46:44.452
No ones dying on my watch, alright.

46:49.900 --> 46:52.110
We need to get
him some real help here.

46:52.787 --> 46:56.094
Good idea. I'll call an ambulance,
I'm gonna get right on that.

46:56.119 --> 46:59.034
What about the jeep?
Unless he got into the garage.

46:59.035 --> 47:00.987
It's been broken down
for a fuckin' year.

47:01.284 --> 47:06.562
Dad is dead, Ethan is dead.
Denny's... not doin' so hot.

47:06.616 --> 47:09.148
I lookin' at your ugly asses,
and guess what I'm thinkin'?
470b
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:11,148
I'm thinkin': fuckin' dead!

47:11.219 --> 47:12.637
You know what?

47:12.728 --> 47:15.831
- No ones ever given a shit what you think!
- Listen, bitch...

47:15.832 --> 47:19.494
Just because my old man was givin' you the
deep dicking, doesn't make you my mother.

47:19.495 --> 47:22.035
And with him dead,
that pretty much makes this my fucking house,
474b
00:47:22,036 --> 00:47:24,235
so why don't you shut the fuck up
or get the fuck out!

47:25.150 --> 47:27.736
- Oh, damn it!
- Hello?

47:39.923 --> 47:41.579
Come on, bitch.

47:43.238 --> 47:45.005
Hey! Enough!

47:45.077 --> 47:46.522
Enough!

47:48.255 --> 47:49.974
Someone's at the door.

48:11.071 --> 48:15.160
- Wanna go take a peak?
- You go take a peak.

48:21.814 --> 48:23.901
You gigantic pussies.

48:24.525 --> 48:26.338
I'll look.

48:57.557 --> 48:59.611
Is it Hoag?

49:00.654 --> 49:03.089
- No, it's a bag.
- What kind of bag?

49:03.787 --> 49:05.833
I don't know, just a bag.

49:08.375 --> 49:09.767
Move!

49:25.665 --> 49:28.147
No! Do not open that door.

49:29.156 --> 49:31.959
Whatever's in the bag,
it's bad.

49:33.182 --> 49:35.590
Just get the fuck out of my way.

49:49.274 --> 49:51.001
That's my Dad's ring.

49:54.031 --> 49:55.878
Is there blood?

49:56.052 --> 49:59.787
- Fuck it.
- Just go out the fuckin' door!

50:00.046 --> 50:03.691
Enough, motherfucker!
Come on! Bring it!

50:18.117 --> 50:20.107
- God...
- Oh fuck!

50:22.872 --> 50:25.903
Denny, I have to get out of here right now.

50:27.854 --> 50:30.935
- I can get the jeep goin'.
- What, are you fuckin' crazy?

50:31.218 --> 50:33.830
If I don't make a move right now,

50:34.292 --> 50:36.553
I'm not gonna last long.

50:37.479 --> 50:40.210
You know it,
I know it.

50:40.675 --> 50:42.893
I can get that jeep goin'.

50:43.364 --> 50:45.879
And I'll get us the fuck outta here.

51:09.029 --> 51:10.564
Gun.

51:15.123 --> 51:16.972
Okay, Denny.

51:18.806 --> 51:22.118
You realize he's probably got
the whole place rigged, right?

51:22.911 --> 51:26.217
Are you ready?
Come on.

51:31.127 --> 51:32.967
Stay here.

51:54.236 --> 51:56.722
You shouldn't have let them go.

51:57.042 --> 51:58.870
What's it to you?

51:59.294 --> 52:03.620
Because when they're dead,
five becomes three.

52:03.702 --> 52:07.048
The last I checked,
there's strength in numbers.

52:28.158 --> 52:31.401
- Hey, I love you.
- I love you too.

52:33.857 --> 52:36.959
Come on, baby. Come on.

52:40.845 --> 52:42.706
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

52:51.634 --> 52:53.094
Fuck!

52:56.486 --> 52:59.652
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna fix it.

52:59.715 --> 53:02.377
- No, no no. Don't fucking leave me!
- I'm gonna fix it.

53:02.409 --> 53:03.807
Don't worry.

53:08.501 --> 53:10.686
Hurry up, baby.

53:11.031 --> 53:12.599
Fuck.

53:15.683 --> 53:17.462
Baby, come on.

53:22.757 --> 53:24.084
Fuck.

53:28.337 --> 53:32.277
Quiet, jumpy!
I'm gonna try a few things.

53:33.320 --> 53:37.999
When I knock on the hood,
you give the key a twist. Alright?

53:38.320 --> 53:43.002
Alright. This will only take a second.

53:43.017 --> 53:44.773
- I'll be back.
- Careful!

54:01.494 --> 54:03.264
No!

54:05.152 --> 54:07.826
Denny, come on. Please.

54:11.964 --> 54:13.000
Gun it!

54:14.391 --> 54:16.954
Yes, yes, it's working,
it's running fine, get in the car!

54:17.384 --> 54:18.954
Really lay down on it!

54:18.955 --> 54:22.317
Denny, Denny, it's running fine.
Please get in the fucking car!

54:32.798 --> 54:36.453
It's fine!
Get in the fucking car, please!

54:40.559 --> 54:42.560
Oh, fuck!

54:43.859 --> 54:46.844
Oh, my God!

54:46.869 --> 54:48.335
No!

54:59.877 --> 55:01.755
We need to go right now!

55:02.587 --> 55:07.396
- When I say run, we run!
- And where the fuck are we suppose to go?

55:07.418 --> 55:11.617
Did you fuckin' hear that?
That was Amber running in the woods.

55:12.086 --> 55:15.914
We need to go right fuckin' now.
Let's move.

55:20.926 --> 55:23.177
Help!  Help!

55:35.298 --> 55:39.471
- Oh my God, Denny!
- Tamara, he's dead.

55:39.812 --> 55:43.094
- Wake up, Denny...
- Tamara, he's dead. Get in the car!

55:54.696 --> 55:57.054
At least you died trying, kid.

55:58.296 --> 55:59.715
Jesus!

56:03.941 --> 56:05.439
Jesus!

56:06.626 --> 56:09.996
- He'll drown in just a second.
- Help me...

56:19.511 --> 56:23.815
- Oh my God, he's alive! You fucking asshole!
- Look at him!  Look at him!

56:23.829 --> 56:27.493
- You fucking asshole! Get the fuck off of him!
- Look at him! Think we're doin' him a favor?

56:27.494 --> 56:29.786
Get him in the God damn fuckin' car!

56:48.822 --> 56:50.896
Why are you doing this?

56:52.926 --> 56:54.275
Keeps me fit.

56:55.793 --> 56:58.295
I didn't do anything wrong.

56:59.595 --> 57:02.351
Then I guess you're just unlucky.

57:30.048 --> 57:31.876
Fuckin' ignorant. (??)

57:33.134 --> 57:34.972
Jackpot.

57:36.761 --> 57:40.897
Seems like I just saved our lives.
How 'bout some thanks?

57:41.202 --> 57:44.350
Hey, I'm sure Denny's super thankful.

57:52.663 --> 57:56.663
- Why don't you turn your lights on??
- Who said I was asking for your opinion?

57:56.677 --> 58:00.049
Well, we've come this far,
It would be nice to actually live.

58:11.135 --> 58:12.779
Fuck!

58:12.780 --> 58:16.004
You just killed the one person
who actually had a soul.

58:16.059 --> 58:19.155
Yeah? Well, what's that make you?

58:31.415 --> 58:33.599
Make sure she doesn't get any ideas.

58:36.292 --> 58:38.147
You got any ideas?

58:40.195 --> 58:41.872
Come on, Denny.

58:44.073 --> 58:46.308
Looks like you may be
the lucky one, bro.

58:55.866 --> 58:58.468
You see it?  You see it?
The moon's really big!

58:58.469 --> 59:00.287
It's like... Whoa, whoa!

59:05.105 --> 59:08.306
Hey. Hey dude. Did you get in
an accident or something?

59:08.613 --> 59:11.198
Exactly. Or something.

59:11.794 --> 59:13.946
Do you need a ride?

59:22.306 --> 59:25.238
This day just keeps
getting better and better.

59:33.127 --> 59:35.374
You come up with a plan yet, genius?

59:39.908 --> 59:41.751
I need to think.

01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:04.383
- Well, hello there.
- Evening.

01:00:04.384 --> 01:00:08.514
Please don't tell you're here for directions.
I got fifteen rooms, all with your name on it.

01:00:08.515 --> 01:00:10.163
Just one, thanks.

01:00:10.414 --> 01:00:13.492
- You solo?
- Are we playing twenty fuckin' questions?

01:00:17.292 --> 01:00:19.955
How 'bout...
Number 3?

01:00:20.627 --> 01:00:24.038
- That's fine.
- All I need's a credit card.

01:00:25.677 --> 01:00:27.231
Course.

01:00:41.775 --> 01:00:45.456
- Interesting name.
- Isn't it?

01:00:45.997 --> 01:00:47.815
Park anywhere you like.

01:00:48.202 --> 01:00:49.767
Have a good night.

01:01:04.119 --> 01:01:06.192
Hello, sheriff?
This is Harris.

01:01:08.402 --> 01:01:11.556
We're driving down a lovely
country road, just you and me.

01:01:11.557 --> 01:01:14.845
If they connect the dots,
we're dead ducks.

01:01:14.846 --> 01:01:19.718
So Hoag and all that shit...
Never fuckin' happened.

01:01:20.204 --> 01:01:23.368
Oh, the wheels of genius are spinning.

01:01:24.575 --> 01:01:26.363
And you, little missy.

01:01:29.877 --> 01:01:34.800
You're gonna nod your head,
like a good little girl.

01:01:35.464 --> 01:01:37.352
So we're driving,

01:01:38.575 --> 01:01:41.892
and holy shit!
We see a girl.

01:01:42.665 --> 01:01:45.906
Crawling out of the woods,
all fucked up.

01:01:45.952 --> 01:01:48.897
We throw her inside,
and we realize,

01:01:49.197 --> 01:01:53.482
we got us Emma fuckin' Ward.

01:01:54.214 --> 01:01:57.970
Payday!
You're my payday.

01:02:00.127 --> 01:02:03.961
So, all you have to do now...

01:02:07.504 --> 01:02:10.786
is kick up our dogs...

01:02:12.669 --> 01:02:16.145
Relax...
Freshen up.

01:02:18.486 --> 01:02:20.239
Come first thing,

01:02:21.261 --> 01:02:23.562
I'm taking you to Nashville.

01:02:27.677 --> 01:02:29.668
Nashville.

01:02:31.127 --> 01:02:33.270
You're taking me home?

01:02:36.269 --> 01:02:38.627
You didn't think that I'd...

01:02:38.646 --> 01:02:44.325
just hand you in to some
back country Johnny Law, did you?

01:02:45.202 --> 01:02:49.126
No, I'm gonna take you
straight to your Daddy.

01:02:51.064 --> 01:02:53.364
Because I want to get paid.

01:02:54.771 --> 01:02:58.665
But I think you're worth more
two million dollars.

01:02:59.895 --> 01:03:04.217
I think you're worth the least...
Five.

01:03:05.819 --> 01:03:07.625
What do you think?

01:03:09.915 --> 01:03:11.650
Come here.

01:03:12.284 --> 01:03:13.990
That a girl.

01:03:14.707 --> 01:03:16.450
That a girl.

01:03:25.267 --> 01:03:27.126
I have to pee.

01:03:32.466 --> 01:03:34.330
I'll be right here.

01:03:53.759 --> 01:03:55.541
The gun's right there.

01:04:01.821 --> 01:04:03.500
Why now?

01:04:03.601 --> 01:04:06.590
Because you won't make it
home alive if you don't.

01:04:08.911 --> 01:04:12.483
So, you kill him.
You hate him enough.

01:04:12.828 --> 01:04:15.179
I don't want to find out that I can't.

01:04:16.849 --> 01:04:18.568
You're different.

01:04:41.931 --> 01:04:44.788
Maybe I should just kill you both.

01:04:57.517 --> 01:04:59.380
Alright, then.

01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:06.018
I'll blow his fucking head off.

01:05:09.278 --> 01:05:12.827
What the fuck is going on here?
You guys havin' a fuckin' sewing circle?

01:05:15.977 --> 01:05:21.041
- I told you I would cooperate.
- You'd say anything, wouldn't you?

01:05:22.949 --> 01:05:28.010
I bet when that psycho had
you tied up under his bed,

01:05:28.305 --> 01:05:32.673
you'd say all sorts of pretty
little lies, wouldn't you?

01:05:38.077 --> 01:05:40.589
You saved my life, Emma.

01:05:42.352 --> 01:05:47.868
I saved you to save myself.
Nothing more.

01:05:48.253 --> 01:05:50.522
Did you search me?

01:05:51.213 --> 01:05:53.042
For a key?

01:05:53.246 --> 01:05:57.352
- For a way out?
- There was no key!

01:06:06.806 --> 01:06:09.549
Because there was no lock.

01:06:12.212 --> 01:06:16.450
Don't lie to me, Emma.
You had a choice.

01:06:16.692 --> 01:06:18.906
And you chose me.

01:06:28.127 --> 01:06:30.447
You don't lie to him.

01:06:31.152 --> 01:06:34.018
Not if you wanna stay alive.

01:06:35.947 --> 01:06:38.462
Well, I'm not afraid of him.

01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:43.415
<i>County Sheriff.</i>

01:06:48.988 --> 01:06:50.408
Shit!

01:06:52.332 --> 01:06:53.965
Get up.

01:07:00.017 --> 01:07:01.241
County Sheriff.
643b
01:07:01,243 --> 01:07:02,241
<i>Open up, please.</i>

01:07:02.264 --> 01:07:05.404
Don't say a fuckin' word.

01:07:12.877 --> 01:07:15.479
- Evening officer.
- Evening.

01:07:34.377 --> 01:07:38.846
We have a problem. It seems we
have a case of identity confusion.

01:07:38.964 --> 01:07:42.138
The hotel manager recalls
someone checkin' in earlier,

01:07:42.139 --> 01:07:45.128
using the same name,
the same credit card.

01:07:45.129 --> 01:07:49.025
Now if I can just check your identification,
we can clear all this up.

01:08:40.127 --> 01:08:41.850
Let's go.

01:08:42.152 --> 01:08:44.152
Tamara, get out here!

01:08:45.238 --> 01:08:46.779
Shit!

01:08:56.702 --> 01:08:57.902
He's here.

01:09:02.044 --> 01:09:03.453
Fuck!

01:09:05.598 --> 01:09:07.335
Hey! Turn around!

01:09:07.702 --> 01:09:09.533
Where do you think you're going?

01:09:48.109 --> 01:09:49.434
Help!

01:10:56.775 --> 01:10:58.734
I'm done running.

01:10:59.745 --> 01:11:01.635
Then come to me.

01:11:46.235 --> 01:11:48.590
They make one of those for your face?

01:13:19.196 --> 01:13:21.062
I must admit...

01:13:21.714 --> 01:13:26.320
- I did not see that coming.
- And give him the honor of killing you?

01:13:26.545 --> 01:13:28.390
I don't think so.

01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:30.841
Emma, come on.

01:13:32.528 --> 01:13:36.597
- We have something special.
- Are you out of your mind?

01:13:36.598 --> 01:13:38.981
I'm very much in my mind.

01:13:42.978 --> 01:13:45.319
After all we've been through,

01:13:46.089 --> 01:13:48.358
you gonna go with this?

01:13:50.181 --> 01:13:52.181
Don't you find it trite?

01:13:52.353 --> 01:13:56.214
This isn't one of your
sociopathic stagings.

01:13:56.895 --> 01:13:59.920
This one is you...
Dying.

01:14:00.011 --> 01:14:06.482
If this were, I don't know, say,
one of my "sociopathic stagings",

01:14:07.454 --> 01:14:10.074
I would have you say exactly that.

01:14:10.539 --> 01:14:11.964
And then,

01:14:14.143 --> 01:14:18.396
I would say:
"Go ahead, pull the trigger".

01:14:19.799 --> 01:14:21.667
No problem.

01:14:26.824 --> 01:14:29.064
College girls...

01:14:30.377 --> 01:14:32.924
They think they've got it all figured out.

01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:37.345
It's called "pump action"
for a reason.

01:14:45.876 --> 01:14:48.276
You can't kill me, Emma.

01:14:50.775 --> 01:14:53.328
And deep inside you...

01:14:59.589 --> 01:15:01.235
Breathe.

01:15:32.439 --> 01:15:34.981
Now it's time to set you free.

01:16:13.470 --> 01:16:16.132
I think this guy stole my wallet.

01:16:21.134 --> 01:16:23.690
Stop! Thief!

01:16:29.628 --> 01:16:32.215
The unfortunate drawback
for learning my name...

01:17:19.911 --> 01:17:21.963
No one lives.

01:18:04.905 --> 01:18:09.970
<i>As more information comes in, it seems that
Emma Ward was the victim of a kidnapping</i>

01:18:09.971 --> 01:18:12.587
<i>by a local group,</i>

01:18:12.671 --> 01:18:14.387
<i>who apparently...</i>
