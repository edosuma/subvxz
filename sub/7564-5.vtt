WEBVTT

00:01.760 --> 00:05.679
Hurry up.
That's good. That's it, right.

00:05.679 --> 00:08.519
Put it down here,
look, in the centre, there.

00:09.800 --> 00:12.278
There.

00:12.279 --> 00:16.478
And we need an eight-foot plastic
sunflower because...?

00:16.480 --> 00:21.318
Think visual impact.
"What's this?" they'll wonder.

00:21.320 --> 00:23.599
"What is he up to now?"

00:23.600 --> 00:26.478
And, "How long has
he been going barmy?"

00:26.480 --> 00:30.998
No, no, no, no, not once they know
it's got mystical powers,

00:31.000 --> 00:35.478
that it comes from an ancient temple
deep in the jungle,

00:35.479 --> 00:38.478
where people used to bring
their babies,

00:38.479 --> 00:40.639
looking for success in life,

00:40.640 --> 00:42.600
and a cure for wind.

00:44.119 --> 00:45.878
You lie faster every day.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.518
Oh, well, thank you, Leroy.

00:47.520 --> 00:49.558
Yes. No, I thought it would bring

00:49.560 --> 00:52.918
a bit of sunshine into the street,
especially today as it's

00:52.920 --> 00:56.558
Kevin's wedding day, I thought,
you know, how appropriate.

00:56.560 --> 00:59.558
Oh, that's if he makes it this time,
he's chickened out twice.

00:59.560 --> 01:03.079
Well, if he chickens out again,
I want my cuff links back.

01:21.879 --> 01:23.400
HE YAWNS

01:26.760 --> 01:28.200
Oh!

01:31.439 --> 01:34.118
Oh, you gave me a fright,
Mr Newbold.

01:34.120 --> 01:38.118
I felt everything shrink. And I'm
supposed to be going to a wedding.

01:38.120 --> 01:41.438
Fright?
You don't know what fright is, boy,

01:41.439 --> 01:44.959
until you've been in the sights
of Mrs Featherstone.

01:44.960 --> 01:49.039
Good morning. Mr Newbold, are you
still calling her Mrs Featherstone?

01:49.039 --> 01:52.198
I thought she'd be
Delphine to you by now.

01:52.200 --> 01:54.878
I've more than I can handle with
Mrs Featherstone,

01:54.879 --> 01:57.000
I'm nowhere near ready for Delphine.

01:58.280 --> 02:00.799
Just a moment, sir, I'll be with you.

02:00.799 --> 02:02.280
Ummm...

02:06.359 --> 02:07.879
TILL RINGS

02:07.879 --> 02:09.560
Eh-eh-eh!

02:11.879 --> 02:15.199
I suppose you and, er,
Mrs Featherstone will be going to

02:15.199 --> 02:17.759
- Kevin's wedding?
- So I'm told.

02:17.759 --> 02:22.399
You need to find your inner monster,
Mr Newbold, mm, put your foot down.

02:22.400 --> 02:25.438
Er, would you excuse us,
please, Mr Newbold?

02:25.439 --> 02:26.838
What? Ah.

02:26.840 --> 02:28.120
Come with me.

02:31.439 --> 02:34.598
What do you think you're doing,
inciting rebellion?

02:34.599 --> 02:37.359
- I feel sorry for him.
- Feel sorry?

02:37.360 --> 02:40.239
You ought to feel sorry for me!
Well, and for you,

02:40.240 --> 02:43.960
because when she hasn't got her
eye on him, she's got her eye on me.

02:45.479 --> 02:47.960
Do you want
the stepmother from hell?

02:49.840 --> 02:52.038
Oh, well,
if he's got to go, he's got to go.

02:52.039 --> 02:53.439
Yeah, that's it.

03:02.800 --> 03:05.998
Well, Mr Newbold,
what can we treat you to today?

03:06.000 --> 03:08.878
Apart from Mrs Featherstone, that is.

03:08.879 --> 03:10.799
Got some nice streaky bacon.

03:10.800 --> 03:14.598
It's been banned,
she's got me on yoghurt and fibre.

03:14.599 --> 03:18.118
Oh, see what it's like, Leroy, to
be in the hands of a caring woman?

03:18.120 --> 03:21.878
In the hands of?
Feels more like an armlock.

03:21.879 --> 03:25.679
- You don't live with her, Mr Newbold.
- And I'm trying to keep it that way.

03:25.680 --> 03:28.519
No, what I mean is, you know,
you've got your own house,

03:28.520 --> 03:31.598
can't you sneak your streaky
when she's not there?

03:31.599 --> 03:33.599
You can't cook bacon sneakily.

03:35.479 --> 03:39.079
She's got a nose like a bloodhound
that thinks it's a Dyson.

03:40.479 --> 03:42.438
Mr Newbold, it is

03:42.439 --> 03:47.038
well-known that, um,
each of Mrs Featherstone's

03:47.039 --> 03:53.520
husbands are reported to have died
from an excess of pure pleasure.

03:56.039 --> 03:57.400
I must keep moving.

03:59.280 --> 04:00.759
Thank you.

04:01.919 --> 04:04.558
I've been up half the night
wondering what to

04:04.560 --> 04:08.558
wear for this wedding,
since somebody shrunk my best suit.

04:08.560 --> 04:11.478
Oh, I wonder who that could be?

04:11.479 --> 04:16.399
Anyway, it's not a problem
for an upscale emporium, Gastric,

04:16.399 --> 04:19.038
we can hire you a suit.

04:19.040 --> 04:20.680
- Eh?
- We can?

04:23.519 --> 04:28.678
We can hire his suit. It's upstairs
in the wardrobe doing nothing.

04:28.680 --> 04:32.358
He'd probably be delighted that it
was earning a few bob.

04:32.360 --> 04:35.079
You're going to charge Gastric?

04:35.079 --> 04:38.639
- Why don't you just lend it to him?
- Any old scruff can borrow a suit.

04:38.639 --> 04:42.439
It takes a better class of person,
entirely, to hire a suit.

04:42.439 --> 04:45.598
The aristocracy always hire a suit.

04:45.600 --> 04:48.558
I mean, you don't think all that
flash at Royal Ascot

04:48.560 --> 04:50.278
is their own, do ya?

04:50.279 --> 04:52.079
I bet it is their own.

04:52.079 --> 04:54.999
- No, rubbish.
- What?

04:55.000 --> 04:58.119
No, you can't move at Moss Bros
in the morning, for peers

04:58.120 --> 04:59.999
of the realm, you know.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Reclaiming their deposits.

05:03.160 --> 05:06.079
- You're an old tight wad.
- Thank you, Leroy.

05:07.319 --> 05:11.399
I hope he heard that,
he'd be, er, s-smiling.

05:13.199 --> 05:17.720
C'mon.
Right... Chop, chop, over there.

05:19.360 --> 05:23.000
That's it.

05:24.480 --> 05:26.079
There you are.

05:31.560 --> 05:33.639
C'mon, let's take it back.

05:37.040 --> 05:38.478
Right, steady.

05:38.480 --> 05:39.879
Oh!

05:45.199 --> 05:48.639
Whoops,
that's a bad omen for a wedding.

05:48.639 --> 05:51.720
Mm, a man in pain -
always lifts the heart a little.

05:53.639 --> 05:56.478
Oh, look at him making a meal of it,

05:56.480 --> 05:58.959
anyone would think he was having
twins.

05:58.959 --> 06:03.519
At least his bruises won't show and
I bet he's recovered by mealtime.

06:03.519 --> 06:05.519
Good job it wasn't Kevin,

06:05.519 --> 06:07.678
you're nervous
enough on your wedding night.

06:07.680 --> 06:10.478
Oh, you should have them
trained by then.

06:10.480 --> 06:11.879
There comes a point

06:11.879 --> 06:15.798
when they learn to look on twin beds
with a sense of relief.

06:15.800 --> 06:19.399
Oh. You must have a softer side
somewhere, Delphine.

06:19.399 --> 06:23.158
Oh, I can get quite girlish over
a handsome bank account.

06:23.160 --> 06:25.838
I could never marry
for money, in case they took you back

06:25.839 --> 06:27.439
if you didn't fit.

06:27.439 --> 06:29.639
And look what you did marry!

06:29.639 --> 06:33.478
And that's another thing, you're
expected to get it right first time.

06:33.480 --> 06:36.358
Well, let's hope it's third time
lucky for the bride.

06:36.360 --> 06:38.639
How was she when you did her
hair this morning?

06:38.639 --> 06:41.838
Twitchy. She was chewing her beads.

06:41.840 --> 06:44.399
Well, that gormless twit
Kevin's called it off

06:44.399 --> 06:47.158
twice at the last minute.

06:47.159 --> 06:48.959
No wonder she's insecure.

06:48.959 --> 06:50.678
I used to be insecure,

06:50.680 --> 06:53.639
until I realised I was insecure
and then it got worse.

06:55.240 --> 06:59.600
Men, they need a firm hand...
everywhere but where they'd like it.

07:01.680 --> 07:06.319
Well, I like weddings, I think
there's still a place for romance.

07:06.319 --> 07:09.120
One less since they pulled
down that bus shelter.

07:14.839 --> 07:17.559
They see
Kevin's light on at all hours,

07:17.560 --> 07:21.158
they see him pacing backwards
and forwards.

07:21.160 --> 07:24.079
I would think Kevin's
better at backwards.

07:24.079 --> 07:27.759
He was so confused when he came
in the shop yesterday, it took

07:27.759 --> 07:30.639
all my willpower not to
overcharge him.

07:32.040 --> 07:34.639
I saw him yesterday,
staring at a wall.

07:34.639 --> 07:37.278
He'll get on well with
the brother-in-law, then.

07:37.279 --> 07:40.079
I passed him in the street, I said,
"Good morning, Kevin,"

07:40.079 --> 07:42.519
and he said, "20 to nine."

07:44.319 --> 07:46.598
Oh, eh-up, here he comes now.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.478
Hello, Kevin,
we were just talking about you.

07:49.480 --> 07:52.119
Huh, I know,
everybody's taking about me -

07:52.120 --> 07:55.999
"Will he or won't he?"
Puts a person under pressure.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.999
You know, er, Kevin, I've always
found the best way to relieve

08:00.000 --> 08:03.439
pressure is to treat yourself,
you know, buy something.

08:04.959 --> 08:07.238
You want to know pressure?

08:07.240 --> 08:10.319
Wait till she catches ya
fancying some other woman.

08:10.319 --> 08:12.639
I don't fancy other women.

08:12.639 --> 08:15.519
Well, they're better than
walls, Kevin.

08:15.519 --> 08:18.278
It's no good never
looking at other women,

08:18.279 --> 08:20.678
your wife won't believe you, anyway.

08:20.680 --> 08:24.478
Oh, don't listen to 'em, Kevin,
they're only pulling your leg.

08:24.480 --> 08:26.519
Anyway, what are you doing here?

08:26.519 --> 08:29.238
Hey, you should be going to get
ready for your wedding.

08:29.240 --> 08:32.798
I'm having a last look
round as a single person.

08:32.799 --> 08:35.200
KEVIN SIGHS AND CLEARS THROAT

08:44.519 --> 08:47.879
I'm going to miss places like this,
where once you were free.

08:47.879 --> 08:49.879
You'll get nothing free in here.

08:51.679 --> 08:54.918
I always think
if everybody's overcharged equally,

08:54.919 --> 08:57.240
it's my contribution to fair-trade.

08:59.679 --> 09:03.480
There we are, sir. Oh, Â£5.00,
just about right, thank you.

09:05.600 --> 09:08.958
Hey, you'll miss more than places,
Kevin, I don't know where I'd be

09:08.960 --> 09:11.719
if she didn't like Walnut Whips.

09:11.720 --> 09:14.519
It's all right for you,
mine's on a diet.

09:15.919 --> 09:19.278
I've always admired the way
you've stayed single,

09:19.279 --> 09:21.438
you're my role model, Granville.

09:21.440 --> 09:25.440
I never have time for a roll,
that's WHY I'm still single.

09:27.080 --> 09:28.519
Ah, Kevin.

09:30.840 --> 09:33.999
Oh, d'you know, I've buried
three husbands

09:34.000 --> 09:37.599
and they looked better at the end
than you do at the beginning.

09:37.600 --> 09:39.599
Where we going?

09:39.600 --> 09:42.359
To get you smartened up
and then married.

09:42.360 --> 09:45.359
It's taken you long enough -
what were you doing?

09:45.360 --> 09:49.399
You're allowed to wed, you know!
Even if nobody's pregnant.

09:51.440 --> 09:54.879
Now, Granville, Granville, I know
that Mr Newbold is pursuing me,

09:54.879 --> 09:57.599
but there's still time for someone
with a back pocket

09:57.600 --> 10:01.120
as full as yours,
to slip a wedge between us.

10:09.960 --> 10:12.960
Hey, you should maybe
think about that, Granville.

10:14.360 --> 10:17.279
I think he'd make a lovely wedge.

10:18.879 --> 10:21.278
Just bog off, you two, will ya?

10:21.279 --> 10:23.440
THEY CHUCKLE

10:34.080 --> 10:36.399
Oh, I'm not saying that
I didn't enjoy it,

10:36.399 --> 10:38.838
but, er, I'm running late -
I'm going to a wedding.

10:38.840 --> 10:40.919
So am I, in about three months.

10:46.639 --> 10:49.600
Right, I'll be back
as soon as I can.

10:52.080 --> 10:54.838
Oh, er, the old lady here,
she usually keeps me talking...

10:54.840 --> 10:56.959
HE CHUCKLES

10:56.960 --> 10:58.440
You know what they're like.

10:59.480 --> 11:02.039
I'll start being good
in three months.

11:23.519 --> 11:25.639
Good day to you, Madge.

11:25.639 --> 11:27.840
It looks a better day for you.

11:29.679 --> 11:32.359
I was just showing him
my wedding shoes.

11:32.360 --> 11:34.639
Is that why your lipstick's smeared?

11:34.639 --> 11:37.600
Oh, it got smudged
when we shared a fig biscuit.

11:38.840 --> 11:41.240
Yes, just a small free sample.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.278
Well, you needn't be looking at me
like that,

11:45.279 --> 11:49.039
I'm old enough to accept
a fig biscuit.

11:53.440 --> 11:57.759
Oh, Kevin, you do look smart.

11:57.759 --> 12:02.359
Except about the face -
look at that expression, I think

12:02.360 --> 12:04.799
I've seen it on a punctured
inner tube.

12:06.480 --> 12:08.678
You'd best keep him till it's time.

12:08.679 --> 12:11.359
Where am I going to keep him?

12:11.360 --> 12:13.559
Same place you keep
your fig biscuits.

12:15.399 --> 12:18.838
Well, I'd stay and keep him
on his mark if I had time,

12:18.840 --> 12:21.720
but I must go and assist
Mr Newbold into a wedding mood.

12:23.360 --> 12:26.399
Now, Kevin, behave,
or I'll be back...

12:26.399 --> 12:28.120
with a blunt needle.

12:29.799 --> 12:33.838
You'll be fine, Kevin -
just because I had a bad marriage

12:33.840 --> 12:36.840
and she had worse, doesn't mean
they're all bad.

12:38.720 --> 12:40.959
You're really not helping.

12:40.960 --> 12:44.959
Kevin, there are many happy
married couples around here.

12:44.960 --> 12:48.879
I mean, you take that Mrs Harris
over there, for example,

12:48.879 --> 12:52.320
she's never been happier
since they had that lodger move in.

12:55.240 --> 12:57.318
I'm only joking. There...

12:57.320 --> 12:58.879
HE CHUCKLES

13:02.039 --> 13:04.678
No, no, it's all right, leave him,
he can't go far,

13:04.679 --> 13:08.759
he can only get as far as the yard,
and the gates are locked.

13:08.759 --> 13:11.759
He'll enjoy a bit of
sunflower therapy.

13:13.279 --> 13:16.559
C'mon, Mavis,
you need to redo your lipstick.

13:21.879 --> 13:25.038
Hey, that was a good line of yours
about the fig biscuit.

13:25.039 --> 13:28.838
Oh, heck, perhaps I'm going to be
a natural at misbehaviour.

13:28.840 --> 13:30.159
Oh!

13:32.120 --> 13:34.720
I think I could live with that.

13:37.639 --> 13:39.279
HE SIGHS

13:40.759 --> 13:43.278
Right...

13:43.279 --> 13:44.759
A-ha, yes...

13:56.039 --> 13:58.359
TYRES SQUEAL

13:58.360 --> 14:00.639
Apply your handbrake, Mr Newbold.

14:05.600 --> 14:09.759
An urge to travel.
This is a new you, Mr Newbold.

14:09.759 --> 14:12.318
Have you forgotten you're taking me
to a wedding?

14:12.320 --> 14:13.558
I hate weddings.

14:13.559 --> 14:16.120
Oh, don't say that,
it could soon be your own.

14:21.600 --> 14:24.438
Now, show me
a nice three-point turn.

14:24.440 --> 14:26.918
Er, but I'm overdue for visiting
this friend.

14:26.919 --> 14:30.038
Oh, but you've got a new friend now,
Mr Newbold - and I'm sure we'll

14:30.039 --> 14:33.438
be very happy together,
once we understand certain rules.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.879
"You must come," he said,
"I'll be expecting you."

14:35.879 --> 14:38.678
Find reverse, Mr Newbold,
it's a knack you'll need

14:38.679 --> 14:39.840
if we're to prosper.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.678
How ancient would you say she was?

14:45.679 --> 14:51.639
- Oh, oh, lost in the mist of time.
- She's plastic.

14:53.120 --> 14:57.519
Oh, er, yes, it's magic, isn't it,
hey?

14:57.519 --> 15:01.759
They were using plastic
when we still had wooden plates.

15:01.759 --> 15:04.840
Well, if she's that old,
how would you find her?

15:06.759 --> 15:09.440
I like to think that, um,
she-she found me.

15:11.399 --> 15:15.759
Can you feel the mojo, Kevin? Mm?

15:15.759 --> 15:18.840
Talk to her... Listen.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.479
She talks?

15:21.480 --> 15:24.519
Oh, yes,
to those fortunate enough to listen.

15:24.519 --> 15:29.119
She's on your side, Kevin,
yours and Eileen's.

15:29.120 --> 15:32.719
Now... don't...
don't let her down, will you?

15:32.720 --> 15:34.759
She's a plastic sunflower...

15:34.759 --> 15:36.719
Hey, what's this?

15:36.720 --> 15:40.198
You're now locked on
to her ancient wisdom.

15:40.200 --> 15:43.559
Don't worry, I'll be back
to undo you for the wedding.

15:57.159 --> 16:01.320
Hiring a suit turned out to be a bit
more expensive than I'd imagined.

16:02.559 --> 16:06.399
That's because you have
no imagination, Gastric.

16:06.399 --> 16:09.278
I tell you what he has got.
A pretty powerful pong.

16:09.279 --> 16:13.119
How can you say that? I'm awash
with deodorant and aftershave.

16:13.120 --> 16:15.359
No, no, it's not you, it's, er...
I think

16:15.360 --> 16:17.359
we've overdone it with the mothballs.

16:17.360 --> 16:19.359
- Oh, is that what it was?
- Mm.

16:19.360 --> 16:21.440
I thought they were Mint Imperials.

16:24.200 --> 16:25.719
Tell me you didn't eat 'em.

16:25.720 --> 16:27.120
I'm not stupid!

16:28.639 --> 16:30.000
One was enough.

16:33.679 --> 16:37.960
I tell you what, though, Gastric,
huh, those moths have got some balls.

16:41.279 --> 16:43.558
HORN TOOTS

16:43.559 --> 16:46.999
Oh, why am I going to a wedding?

16:47.000 --> 16:49.240
I hate weddings.

16:50.559 --> 16:52.239
Oh, stop fighting it, Newbold.

16:52.240 --> 16:55.519
You're helpless in the slipstream
of a determined woman.

17:28.880 --> 17:31.398
Go on, then. Do it.

17:31.400 --> 17:34.038
Still can't believe
you're closing the shop.

17:34.039 --> 17:36.480
I can do it. I can, I can do it.

17:39.880 --> 17:42.440
I can close the shop!

17:45.039 --> 17:47.679
No, no, it's all right, just...
We'll do it in a minute,

17:47.680 --> 17:50.759
there's no need to close
before we have to, is there?

17:50.759 --> 17:54.358
- It's nearly time.
- Mm? I know what time it is.

17:54.359 --> 17:56.638
- How long?
- Mm? How long what?

17:56.640 --> 17:58.838
How long are you going to close
the shop for?

17:58.839 --> 18:02.838
Oh, er, well, you know...
It's Eileen's wedding, isn't it?

18:02.839 --> 18:06.798
And she's waited a long time,
you know, and if she could

18:06.799 --> 18:10.999
wait for two years, we can close the
shop for a couple of hours, can't we?

18:11.000 --> 18:12.318
A couple of hours?

18:12.319 --> 18:14.759
Minutes, minutes, couple of minutes,
minutes I meant,

18:14.759 --> 18:16.118
that's what I meant.

18:16.119 --> 18:18.558
I mean, I tell you what,
what we'll do is, you see,

18:18.559 --> 18:22.959
we'll go to the service and then, and
then we'll come back here and then

18:22.960 --> 18:26.878
you can stay here and then I can
go to the reception, then I'll come

18:26.880 --> 18:31.000
back here and then you can stay here
and I can go back to the reception.

18:33.200 --> 18:34.519
Sounds like fun.

18:36.720 --> 18:40.759
Is that your best tie?
Could you not find a better tie?

18:40.759 --> 18:44.999
Well, it's too late now, you'll just
have to keep stroking your chin.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Did you bring a clean hanky?

18:54.279 --> 18:56.000
Yes, oh!

18:57.920 --> 18:59.559
Well, hello.

19:00.559 --> 19:03.599
Is there a photoshoot
going on in the street?

19:05.039 --> 19:07.078
Hello, Mavis.

19:07.079 --> 19:08.679
Hello, Granville.

19:08.680 --> 19:11.160
You're looking very grocer-friendly.

19:13.119 --> 19:15.558
And what does that make me?

19:15.559 --> 19:19.719
Oh, yes, I was coming to you, yes...
Well, I think you're getting,

19:19.720 --> 19:23.720
er, very close to
borderline attractive.

19:25.759 --> 19:27.239
You both look great.

19:27.240 --> 19:30.479
Well, thank you, Leroy, I'm glad
one of you's got manners.

19:30.480 --> 19:33.558
I'd like some tissues -
I always cry at weddings.

19:33.559 --> 19:37.719
Well, the marriage you had -
enough to make anybody cry.

19:37.720 --> 19:39.439
Well, yours was no pleasure trip.

19:39.440 --> 19:42.400
I know, let's hope Eileen
does better.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.919
Where's the slippery Kevin?

19:45.920 --> 19:50.279
Ah, well, he's, er, safe within the
embrace of his spiritual advisor.

19:55.440 --> 19:58.878
Aftershave?
That's very adventurous.

19:58.880 --> 20:02.078
Do you have a secret side
that I should know about?

20:02.079 --> 20:05.318
I've had it for years,
it's an old Christmas gift.

20:05.319 --> 20:08.479
Oh, they must've thought you were
the kind to use aftershave.

20:08.480 --> 20:10.680
Never struck me
as Hugo Boss material.

20:20.640 --> 20:22.878
Well, what are we waiting for?

20:22.880 --> 20:25.558
Well, instructions -
where am I going?

20:25.559 --> 20:29.039
Well, we're going past the shop
to pick up Nurse Gladys.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.799
Well... How do I look?

20:35.000 --> 20:38.839
You look... unsinkable.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.719
Unsinkable?

20:42.720 --> 20:45.000
I meant... Nice.

20:50.480 --> 20:54.439
And don't slouch,
keep your shoulders back. I do.

20:54.440 --> 20:56.400
You keep everything back.

20:58.039 --> 21:01.838
And just remember -
there's a help-yourself buffet.

21:01.839 --> 21:04.319
That does NOT include
the bridesmaids.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.838
As if.

21:07.839 --> 21:12.519
You'd only tell your mother - you
know I live in fear of your mother.

21:12.519 --> 21:15.479
Oh, there's no need...!

21:15.480 --> 21:17.680
Just live in fear of me!

21:22.599 --> 21:29.039
Ah. Ha, right. Here we are, all
looking delicious. Even Cyril.

21:30.400 --> 21:32.999
So it's time to undo the groom.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.920
Leroy, go and undo him
and don't let him get away.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.159
Where's the key?

21:39.160 --> 21:40.400
Erm...

21:42.480 --> 21:44.959
I dunno, I thought you had it.

21:44.960 --> 21:48.439
Surely he's not still
fighting marriage?!

21:48.440 --> 21:50.559
Well, you have to admire him.

21:52.880 --> 21:55.878
Not if you want a peaceful day.

21:55.880 --> 21:59.278
I don't care if he is fighting,
he's still going down.

21:59.279 --> 22:02.999
It's sad, really, we used to hold him
up as an example.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.559
Yeah.

22:06.519 --> 22:09.680
Before we discovered
the delights of matrimony.

22:11.319 --> 22:14.079
- Give us a kiss.
- Get lost.

22:16.400 --> 22:18.398
- You see what I mean?
- Mm.

22:18.400 --> 22:20.279
Maybe YOU dropped it in the yard?

22:21.759 --> 22:25.319
What if he's found it? Quick!

22:27.000 --> 22:31.359
Mind the suit! Mind one
of the world's most expensive suits!

22:32.680 --> 22:36.480
Hey! This is private property
back here. Oh, heck.

22:39.920 --> 22:41.799
Oh...

22:48.240 --> 22:50.638
What's the problem?

22:50.640 --> 22:51.759
He is.

22:51.759 --> 22:54.798
That's going to be inconvenient
when they retire for the night.

22:54.799 --> 22:56.519
Well, it's no big deal,

22:56.519 --> 23:00.479
just cut the flower away from that
big tub of concrete.

23:00.480 --> 23:04.759
No way, I paid good money for this
ancient sacred item,

23:04.759 --> 23:09.598
it comes all the way
from the jungles of Patagonia.

23:09.599 --> 23:11.119
He means Leeds.

23:13.599 --> 23:19.159
C'mon, c'mon, to me, to me,
that's it, right, that's it.

23:19.160 --> 23:21.798
Gastric, get... get the door,
will you?

23:21.799 --> 23:23.598
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

23:23.599 --> 23:27.479
Right, now down your end,
down, down - right, push, lads.

23:27.480 --> 23:30.079
It'll go, it'll go.
Don't worry.

23:31.440 --> 23:35.358
Get it back the other way. Put the
pot in first, it's obvious, isn't it?

23:35.359 --> 23:38.638
- Stand there, Gastric.
- One, two, three!

23:38.640 --> 23:40.999
Right, your end down now.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.038
Right, in you go, that's it,
it'll... it'll work this time.

23:44.039 --> 23:48.239
You dozy beggar,
fancy chaining him up!

23:48.240 --> 23:50.558
That's another wedding
he's going to miss.

23:50.559 --> 23:54.199
No, he won't, we'll get him
there one way or another.

23:54.200 --> 23:57.039
Right, think of something else,
c'mon.

24:06.119 --> 24:07.680
It's all right.

24:10.079 --> 24:12.719
Oh, ah, oh, no, ah!

24:12.720 --> 24:14.479
- Oh-oh-oh.
- Eh, up.

24:14.480 --> 24:18.160
Stop! Ah-oh, help! Oh! No!

24:20.119 --> 24:22.759
HE WAILS

24:49.279 --> 24:52.079
Why can't he wear a buttonhole,
like anyone else?

24:56.400 --> 24:57.839
SHE MOUTHS

25:02.920 --> 25:05.240
THEY MUTTER

25:34.359 --> 25:36.279
Hello, erm, good afternoon.

25:39.960 --> 25:43.078
We're gathered here today
to celebrate the union

25:43.079 --> 25:46.318
of Eileen and Kevin.

25:46.319 --> 25:50.919
Marriage is a desire by two people
to share their lives together,

25:50.920 --> 25:55.039
and a willingness to accept
each other for who they are.

25:57.279 --> 26:00.119
SHE SNIFFLES

26:04.200 --> 26:07.719
It is a commitment to friendship...

26:07.720 --> 26:11.200
mutual respect...
and calls for patience...

26:21.359 --> 26:25.519
...courage and, of course, humour...

26:32.960 --> 26:34.599
GASTRIC BURPS

26:36.920 --> 26:38.839
SHE COUGHS

26:40.920 --> 26:44.838
And now a solemn moment
has arrived for these,

26:44.839 --> 26:50.759
Eileen and Kevin, to contract
their marriage before you.

27:01.680 --> 27:03.599
CAMERA CLICKS

27:10.000 --> 27:13.039
'They'll all be raving
now at the disco.

27:14.039 --> 27:18.119
'I hope Gastric's not
over-exercising that suit.

27:21.480 --> 27:25.279
'You do realise you're now married
to Eileen?

27:32.039 --> 27:33.680
'Not to mention Kevin.'

27:38.079 --> 27:41.638
Hey, you not going the disco?

27:41.640 --> 27:43.638
At my time of life, Leroy,

27:43.640 --> 27:47.278
I'd be much happier curled up
with a good book.

27:47.279 --> 27:49.878
Good evening, Leroy.

27:49.880 --> 27:52.680
And if Madge asks,
I'm still at the disco.

27:55.720 --> 27:57.640
Oh, enjoy your book.

27:59.279 --> 28:01.759
I hope I can remember my place.
