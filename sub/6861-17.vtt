WEBVTT

00:03.204 --> 00:05.005
Zoe knows about us.

00:05.005 --> 00:07.408
WADE: Why you stopped our little
 frolic the other night?

00:07.408 --> 00:08.776
You got googly-eyes
for golden boy George?

00:08.776 --> 00:10.278
I'm nearly 30 years old,

00:10.278 --> 00:12.280
and I have never been
in a real relationship.

00:12.280 --> 00:14.082
You did a pretty good job
of letting me in just now.

00:14.082 --> 00:15.783
I found out that my dad

00:15.783 --> 00:17.085
moved back to New York

00:17.085 --> 00:18.586
and kind of didn't tell me.

00:18.586 --> 00:20.188
The only thing
Ethan Hart cares about

00:20.188 --> 00:22.423
is the fact that we don't
share the same DNA.

00:22.423 --> 00:24.225
You are the most selfish
person I have ever met!

00:24.225 --> 00:25.293
I'm done.
Don't say that.

00:25.293 --> 00:26.494
We're done, Dad.
(groaning)

00:26.494 --> 00:27.695
Dad?

00:27.695 --> 00:28.696
Dad!

00:28.696 --> 00:29.797
I heard about your dad.

00:29.797 --> 00:31.065
We got a good surgeon.

00:31.065 --> 00:31.899
Now you have a great one.

00:31.899 --> 00:32.966
I called my father.

00:32.966 --> 00:34.668
He'll be here tomorrow.

00:37.505 --> 00:39.507
(pinging)

00:41.109 --> 00:43.477
(pinging)

00:45.113 --> 00:46.447
(pinging continues)

00:54.822 --> 00:56.624
Um, what are we looking at?

00:56.624 --> 00:57.525
My father.

00:57.525 --> 00:59.860
In the form
of a blinking red dot.

00:59.860 --> 01:00.961
See?

01:00.961 --> 01:03.397
He keeps getting... closer.

01:03.397 --> 01:04.498
Closer.

01:04.498 --> 01:06.934
Closer, oh, God, he's closer.

01:06.934 --> 01:09.670
Uh, how long have we been
staring at the blinking red dot?

01:09.670 --> 01:10.571
Since Delaware.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.005
His flight lands
in under an hour,

01:12.005 --> 01:13.907
and when it does,
I'm going to be waiting for him

01:13.907 --> 01:16.444
at the hospital,
and I'm going to be doing this.

01:16.444 --> 01:18.011
Ooh.

01:18.011 --> 01:19.413
And what's happening right now?

01:19.413 --> 01:21.915
I'm giving you my cold face.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.384
Hard core, right?

01:23.384 --> 01:24.418
Uh, I don't know.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.120
You just kind of look bored.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.321
(groans) No!

01:27.321 --> 01:28.956
I look like I don't care.

01:28.956 --> 01:31.692
You know, that's what I want
him to think, "Hey, Dad,

01:31.692 --> 01:33.727
"you don't care about me,
I don't care about you

01:33.727 --> 01:35.062
just as much, whatevs."

01:35.062 --> 01:37.798
And then he'll do the surgery,
save George's father,

01:37.798 --> 01:40.100
and then it's on.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.269
What's on?

01:41.269 --> 01:43.637
I'm gonna unleash the whoop-ass.

01:43.637 --> 01:45.506
Oh, but I thought you just said
you didn't care?

01:45.506 --> 01:47.808
No, of course I care,
but I can't let him know that

01:47.808 --> 01:49.443
right away or he might kill
Mr. Tucker.

01:49.443 --> 01:50.911
It's a very
stressful situation, Addy.

01:50.911 --> 01:52.680
Okay, maybe I should drive you.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.448
Yeah, I think
that would be best.

01:54.448 --> 01:56.450
(pinging)
Closer.

02:09.530 --> 02:11.265
Hey.

02:12.065 --> 02:14.268
Thought you'd be in Mobile.

02:15.503 --> 02:17.037
I'm headed back
to the hospital.

02:17.037 --> 02:21.742
I just came here to pick up
Mrs. Tucker some butter cookies.

02:21.742 --> 02:25.713
Did you get a chance to
talk to George about, uh...

02:25.713 --> 02:28.148
The man's father
just had a heart attack.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.751
For God's sake, Lavon.

02:30.751 --> 02:32.620
Hardly think it's
an appropriate time.

02:32.620 --> 02:34.622
Well, hey, I'm, I'm sorry.

02:34.622 --> 02:36.757
I just want to be
prepared, that's all.

02:36.757 --> 02:40.361
Frankly, I don't know
when I'm gonna tell him now.

02:40.361 --> 02:43.264
Zoe's father is flying in
for the surgery,

02:43.264 --> 02:44.732
so George is already
beyond grateful.

02:44.732 --> 02:47.235
I'm not sure I'm following.

02:47.235 --> 02:48.769
The minute that I tell
George the truth,

02:48.769 --> 02:51.171
who do you think
he's gonna go running to?

02:51.171 --> 02:52.773
Zoe Hart, that's who.

02:52.773 --> 02:55.175
But if I don't tell him
soon, then she will, okay?

02:55.175 --> 02:56.577
So, I'm trapped.

02:56.577 --> 02:58.379
No, I still don't think
Zoe will say anything.

02:58.379 --> 02:59.713
She promised me.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.114
Can you just...

03:01.114 --> 03:02.516
give me some credit?

03:02.516 --> 03:04.352
This girl has been
trying to ruin my life

03:04.352 --> 03:05.819
since the minute
that she got here,

03:05.819 --> 03:09.257
and now she finally has
the chance, thanks to you, so...

03:09.257 --> 03:11.459
I hope you're happy.

03:19.166 --> 03:20.701
Hey.

03:20.701 --> 03:21.869
Cup of coffee.

03:21.869 --> 03:22.936
Make it strong.

03:22.936 --> 03:25.205
I need to stay mean
for the next few hours,

03:25.205 --> 03:26.674
and caffeine keeps me edgy.
Somehow,

03:26.674 --> 03:28.208
I don't think it's
in my best interests

03:28.208 --> 03:29.209
to make you any meaner.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.778
Oh, don't worry.

03:30.778 --> 03:33.647
All of my anger today will be
focused on dear old dad.
Huh.

03:33.647 --> 03:35.649
And I thought it was only
your mom that you hated.

03:35.649 --> 03:38.519
Well, I did, but then I realized
it wasn't fair of me

03:38.519 --> 03:40.721
to pour all of my bitterness

03:40.721 --> 03:41.989
and resentment

03:41.989 --> 03:43.457
into one parent, okay?

03:43.457 --> 03:46.059
So, my mom may have lied to me,
but my dad abandoned me.

03:46.059 --> 03:48.662
Yeah, but wasn't that like
a million years ago?
Yes.

03:48.662 --> 03:50.298
But then he moved two weeks ago,

03:50.298 --> 03:51.765
and he didn't even tell me.

03:51.765 --> 03:53.901
So, that was the straw
that broke the camel's back.

03:53.901 --> 03:54.868
Come on.

03:54.868 --> 03:56.837
Finally, I got
in touch with my anger.

03:56.837 --> 04:00.107
So, today, I'm gonna get all up
in his grill with it.

04:00.107 --> 04:01.108
(snickers)
What?

04:01.108 --> 04:01.942
You think I won't?

04:03.010 --> 04:05.313
That's real hot.

04:08.949 --> 04:10.017
See that?

04:10.017 --> 04:12.185
Made of steel, baby.

04:12.185 --> 04:13.787
Made of... (coughs)

04:16.390 --> 04:18.559
Hey, you gonna... you
gonna pay for that or...?

04:19.527 --> 04:21.128
Hey, Twig, how you doing?

04:21.128 --> 04:22.530
Mr. Maynard!

04:22.530 --> 04:24.698
What an unexpected honor, sir.

04:24.698 --> 04:27.568
Welcome to your Jammer.
What can I get you?

04:27.568 --> 04:29.370
Well, it's good to
see somebody remembers

04:29.370 --> 04:30.938
where the paychecks
are coming from.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.406
Good morning, patrons.

04:32.406 --> 04:34.274
Does anybody here know
what today is?

04:34.274 --> 04:35.275
Monday!

04:35.275 --> 04:35.943
No.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.010
Tuesday!

04:37.010 --> 04:38.479
Never mind.

04:38.479 --> 04:42.350
Today is the 30th anniversary
of the Rammer Jammer.

04:45.919 --> 04:46.620
And so,

04:46.620 --> 04:48.322
to honor her birthday,

04:48.322 --> 04:50.290
I'm gonna spruce
the old gal up a bit.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.559
Now, for starters,

04:51.559 --> 04:54.227
My lovely niece Wanda
is going to be joining

04:54.227 --> 04:56.096
our staff as the new bar back.

04:56.096 --> 04:57.998
Whoo-hoo-hoo! Wanda!

05:00.100 --> 05:03.203
I'll also be bringing
in a pool table for the back.

05:03.203 --> 05:04.505
And I'm adding

05:04.505 --> 05:07.708
a new signature cocktail
to our menu.

05:07.708 --> 05:08.742
Uh...

05:08.742 --> 05:10.378
we don't have
any signature cocktails

05:10.378 --> 05:11.879
on the menu.

05:11.879 --> 05:14.348
Which might be why we
never make Esquire's list

05:14.348 --> 05:16.384
of top 100 bars in America.

05:16.384 --> 05:17.385
And to turn up the heat,

05:17.385 --> 05:19.453
we gonna make it a contest.

05:19.453 --> 05:20.754
Shelley vs. Wade.

05:21.288 --> 05:22.623
Whoever comes up

05:22.623 --> 05:24.825
with the best signature cocktail
gets to name it.

05:24.825 --> 05:25.359
(gasps)

05:25.359 --> 05:26.394
Yay.
And...

05:26.394 --> 05:27.761
gets 500 bucks.

05:28.261 --> 05:29.730
(sighs)

05:29.730 --> 05:31.732
(applause)

05:31.732 --> 05:33.266
Oh, my God.

05:33.266 --> 05:34.668
May the best person win.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.537
I can help you if you want.

05:36.537 --> 05:38.439
I'm real good at drinking.

05:39.540 --> 05:41.575
Come on, Wanda.
Oh.

05:43.544 --> 05:46.213
(EKG monitor
beeping rhythmically)

05:46.213 --> 05:48.081
(groaning softly)

05:51.885 --> 05:52.786
Dad, you okay?

05:52.786 --> 05:54.254
(coughing)
Can I get you a pillow?

05:54.254 --> 05:56.156
Another pillow? Do you want me
to call the nurse for you?

05:56.156 --> 05:57.425
Stop fussing, George, I'm fine.

05:57.425 --> 06:00.093
How about this?
Is that better?

06:05.533 --> 06:07.367
You're a good son.

06:17.511 --> 06:19.713
Yeah, I'm...

06:21.582 --> 06:23.116
What's all that?

06:23.116 --> 06:25.819
Oh, um, it's just
a few things I brought

06:25.819 --> 06:27.087
to make it a little homier.

06:27.087 --> 06:30.223
I found some saltwater taffy
for you to enjoy

06:30.223 --> 06:31.324
after surgery.

06:31.324 --> 06:33.193
It's banana flavored.
(groans)

06:33.193 --> 06:35.563
I feel tired all of the sudden.

06:35.563 --> 06:38.165
Maybe I ought to just
close my eyes, huh?

06:39.199 --> 06:40.668
Of course.

06:42.936 --> 06:45.005
(sighs)

06:45.005 --> 06:47.240
God, he looks pale,
doesn't he?

06:47.240 --> 06:48.408
Baby,

06:48.408 --> 06:50.277
he's sick,
but after the surgery,

06:50.277 --> 06:52.580
he's gonna be just fine.

06:52.580 --> 06:54.548
I still can't believe

06:54.548 --> 06:56.249
that Zoe made that phone call.

06:56.249 --> 06:59.086
I mean, I don't know how we're
ever gonna be able to repay her.

06:59.086 --> 07:02.189
Well, I mean, you know,
she called her father.

07:02.189 --> 07:04.224
It's not like she
called the president.

07:04.224 --> 07:06.426
(wry chuckle)

07:07.895 --> 07:09.763
Lemon, you don't know
what you're talking about.

07:11.098 --> 07:14.468
Zoe calling her father is...
is just about the same

07:14.468 --> 07:16.236
as you calling your mother.

07:16.236 --> 07:18.005
So, it is a huge deal.

07:18.005 --> 07:20.240
I'm sorry, I... I had
no idea, George.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.642
I know you didn't.

07:21.642 --> 07:23.644
You know what, Lemon?

07:23.644 --> 07:25.045
Just, from now on,

07:25.045 --> 07:27.815
just keep all
that nonsense to yourself

07:27.815 --> 07:30.017
'cause I don't want
to hear it anymore.

07:30.017 --> 07:32.452
George, I'm...
The truth
of the matter is,

07:32.452 --> 07:35.055
if you wouldn't have
made me get in that
stupid fight with my dad,

07:35.055 --> 07:36.924
he probably wouldn't be laying
in that bed right now.

07:36.924 --> 07:40.393
So, if you want to be mad
at somebody, Lemon,

07:40.393 --> 07:42.930
you go ahead
and be mad at yourself.

07:49.436 --> 07:53.273
ADDY: All right, just remember,
keep it short and simple,

07:53.273 --> 07:54.642
and then after the surgery,

07:54.642 --> 07:56.309
That's when you hit him
with the big punches.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.678
Mm-hmm.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.513
That's him.

07:59.513 --> 08:02.950
* *

08:32.980 --> 08:34.847
Zoe.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.249
It's good to see you.

08:40.988 --> 08:42.455
Wasn't sure you'd be here.

08:42.455 --> 08:44.457
Well, I am.

08:44.457 --> 08:46.326
I'm glad you are.

08:46.326 --> 08:48.361
Dr. Hart?

08:48.361 --> 08:50.530
Good afternoon, I'm Dr. Brady,
chief of staff.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.733
It's an honor to meet you.
What's the cardiac output?

08:52.733 --> 08:54.735
31%. Patient was
intubated last night.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.837
Prep for mitrovalve replacement.

08:56.837 --> 08:58.138
Coronary artery bypass

08:58.138 --> 08:59.539
and Teflon graft.

08:59.539 --> 09:02.309
This is Dr. Hart; she's going
to be assisting me in surgery

09:02.309 --> 09:04.277
this afternoon.
I am?

09:05.478 --> 09:07.480
Yes, I am.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.149
Uh, we hadn't
anticipated...

09:09.149 --> 09:11.451
That is Dr. Hart doesn't
currently have privileges

09:11.451 --> 09:12.620
at this hospital.

09:12.620 --> 09:15.589
So get her some.

09:17.591 --> 09:19.960
Uh, what happened
to your cold face?

09:19.960 --> 09:21.561
Don't worry, the plan
is still on track.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.196
After the surgery, big fight.

09:23.196 --> 09:24.197
Okay.

09:24.197 --> 09:26.166
Zoe, you coming?

09:26.166 --> 09:28.101
Yes, sir.

09:30.037 --> 09:32.405
(car horn honks)

09:32.405 --> 09:34.507
(seagulls calling)

09:34.507 --> 09:36.844
(birds singing)

09:41.248 --> 09:43.250
Kocher clamp.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.318
(EKG monitor beeping)

09:45.318 --> 09:47.320
Must be difficult for you.

09:47.320 --> 09:48.856
Seeing him this way.

09:48.856 --> 09:50.190
Seeing who this way?

09:51.859 --> 09:53.727
Oh, you mean Mr. Tucker?

09:53.727 --> 09:55.495
Is that what you call him?

09:55.495 --> 09:57.564
I don't call him anything;
I barely know the man.

09:57.564 --> 09:59.833
You don't?

09:59.833 --> 10:01.234
But I thought...

10:03.336 --> 10:05.605
Cautery.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.142
I was assuming

10:09.142 --> 10:12.145
that the relationship between
you and his son was serious.

10:12.145 --> 10:13.446
George and me?

10:13.446 --> 10:15.282
We don't have a relationship.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.283
I mean,

10:16.283 --> 10:18.752
we're friends,
but that's all.

10:18.752 --> 10:20.620
Oh.
Yeah.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.790
But...

10:22.790 --> 10:24.191
Take over suction.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.109
I need a drink.

10:42.910 --> 10:46.113
How about an artisanal cocktail

10:46.113 --> 10:50.150
to celebrate spring in Alabama?

10:51.284 --> 10:53.186
But I don't want
to celebrate spring.

10:53.186 --> 10:54.822
Try that.

10:59.092 --> 11:00.293
No! No! No!

11:00.293 --> 11:02.662
No, it's nasty!
What? Thought
it was good.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.131
Go ahead and try that.

11:04.131 --> 11:08.035
Oh, hell, no. No,
I did not make that.

11:08.035 --> 11:10.537
It's Shelley. She's putting
stuff in your drinks.

11:10.537 --> 11:11.872
I saw her do it.

11:11.872 --> 11:14.341
Can't talk. Very busy.

11:14.341 --> 11:17.878
Oh, you are going down
like Chinatown.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.815
Not 'cause you're Asian.
'Cause it rhymes.

11:21.815 --> 11:23.283
What is going on?

11:23.283 --> 11:25.853
Doing a contest. Best new
cocktail wins 500 bucks.

11:25.853 --> 11:27.921
Daddy needs a new amp.

11:27.921 --> 11:30.357
You can be my daddy.

11:30.357 --> 11:31.491
Thank you, Wanda.

11:31.491 --> 11:33.560
(growls)

11:33.560 --> 11:35.195
(laughs)

11:36.830 --> 11:39.699
Did that girl just...
grrr at you?

11:39.699 --> 11:40.934
It happens.

11:40.934 --> 11:42.102
Point is, she's right, okay?

11:42.102 --> 11:44.037
I should be doing this
in my own home,

11:44.037 --> 11:45.372
but the amount of booze

11:45.372 --> 11:46.506
it would take...

11:46.506 --> 11:47.908
Let's do it. I'll buy.

11:47.908 --> 11:49.109
Seriously?
Why not?

11:49.109 --> 11:51.044
This is exactly the kind
of mindless fun

11:51.044 --> 11:53.113
Lavon Hayes needs right now.

11:53.113 --> 11:55.248
Let's make some cocktails, baby!

11:55.248 --> 11:56.583
My man!
Yeah.

11:56.583 --> 11:58.919
(rhythmic beeping and whooshing)

12:00.954 --> 12:02.956
Dr. Hart, what is
your recommendation

12:02.956 --> 12:05.225
if our pathology was
a pseudo aneurysm?

12:05.225 --> 12:08.829
Um, surgical repair similar
to ventricular rupture.

12:08.829 --> 12:09.830
Your recommendation?

12:09.830 --> 12:11.198
Coronary artery bypass

12:11.198 --> 12:13.867
and, uh, Teflon graft
repair of the ruptured zone.

12:13.867 --> 12:14.868
Very good.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.870
Dr. Hart will now perform

12:16.870 --> 12:19.739
a resection
of the damaged ventricle

12:19.739 --> 12:21.508
and closure defect.

12:21.508 --> 12:24.477
You know, it's been a while
since I've done one of those.

12:24.477 --> 12:25.879
Think you can handle it?

12:27.347 --> 12:28.615
Absolutely.

12:28.615 --> 12:30.283
I agree.

12:35.588 --> 12:36.389
Retractor.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.392
Suction.

12:46.366 --> 12:47.467
All good.

12:47.467 --> 12:48.601
Okay.
Oh.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.170
Surgery was a success.
He's gonna need to be

12:50.170 --> 12:52.239
on blood thinners
from now on, but all...

12:52.239 --> 12:53.841
But he's going to be okay?

12:53.841 --> 12:54.908
He's going to be okay.

12:54.908 --> 12:56.543
Oh, Dr. Hart,
thank you so much.

12:56.543 --> 12:58.078
Thank you.
No worries.

12:58.078 --> 12:59.913
Dr. Hart, I don't know what
to say. All I can say is...

12:59.913 --> 13:01.048
All I can say is...
You are an

13:01.048 --> 13:02.782
angel sent from heaven.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.151
One little package.

13:04.151 --> 13:05.285
Oh, I didn't do anything.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.820
Yes, you did.
Yes, you did.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.388
You did everything.
Thank you so much.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.690
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.

13:10.690 --> 13:12.392
Thank you.

13:12.392 --> 13:13.593
And you're welcome.

13:13.593 --> 13:16.196
You're welcome. Sure...

13:16.196 --> 13:19.066
Um, now, there are going
to be some restrictions

13:19.066 --> 13:20.467
on Mr. Tucker
for the next few weeks.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.035
Yeah?
He should avoid
climbing stairs.

13:22.035 --> 13:23.236
Okay, no stairs.

13:23.236 --> 13:25.405
No lifting objects
more than ten pounds.

13:25.405 --> 13:26.506
All right.
Okay.

13:26.506 --> 13:27.440
We probably hide the Scotch.

13:27.440 --> 13:28.808
I don't know if
we can do that.

13:28.808 --> 13:29.809
Discourage the Scotch.
Okay.
Okay.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.044
Ah, but he did
very well...

13:31.044 --> 13:33.413
Crickett, meet me at
my house in an hour.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.348
It's an emergency.

13:35.348 --> 13:37.918
That was impressive work
you did in there, Zoe.

13:37.918 --> 13:40.187
Thank you. Thanks.

13:40.187 --> 13:43.590
No. Actually, I wanted
to talk to you...
I'm glad
you called. It's...

13:43.590 --> 13:44.992
Uh... (laughs)
You go first.

13:44.992 --> 13:46.793
Okay. Um...

13:46.793 --> 13:51.664
I've been meaning to call
you for some time now, um,

13:51.664 --> 13:54.634
but my-my schedule has
just been so hectic and...

13:54.634 --> 13:56.569
Yeah, sure.

13:56.569 --> 13:58.505
Frankly, um...

13:58.505 --> 14:02.309
it felt like a conversation
that had to be in person.

14:02.309 --> 14:04.277
Oh.

14:04.277 --> 14:07.380
The secret that your
mother asked me to keep

14:07.380 --> 14:09.983
has been a strain
on our relationship

14:09.983 --> 14:11.218
for far too long.

14:11.218 --> 14:12.953
I know. I completely agree.
Just because

14:12.953 --> 14:14.387
I'm not your
father doesn't mean

14:14.387 --> 14:17.457
that we can't have another
kind of relationship.

14:17.457 --> 14:20.660
Um, how do you mean?

14:20.660 --> 14:22.963
Well, for instance,
we're both surgeons.

14:22.963 --> 14:25.865
Technically, that
makes us colleagues.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.167
That's an excellent
foundation.

14:27.167 --> 14:29.102
Wouldn't you agree?

14:29.102 --> 14:30.670
I guess. You know, I just...

14:30.670 --> 14:32.739
I've never really
thought of it that way.

14:32.739 --> 14:34.374
Of course you haven't,

14:34.374 --> 14:37.010
'cause we've been so mired down
in what we can't be

14:37.010 --> 14:39.712
that we haven't fully explored
the alternatives.

14:39.712 --> 14:42.615
You mean, like, friends?

14:42.615 --> 14:43.883
Why not?

14:43.883 --> 14:45.885
In fact, there's
no pressing reason

14:45.885 --> 14:47.554
that I have to return

14:47.554 --> 14:48.688
to New York right away.

14:48.688 --> 14:51.024
How would you like
to have dinner tomorrow night?

14:51.024 --> 14:53.360
In BlueBell?

14:53.360 --> 14:54.761
Sure.

14:54.761 --> 14:56.196
We can talk about the surgery,

14:56.196 --> 14:58.365
discuss your career,
whatever you like.

14:59.199 --> 15:01.001
Yeah, that sounds great.

15:01.001 --> 15:03.903
Um, uh....

15:03.903 --> 15:06.239
Call me Ethan.

15:07.274 --> 15:09.509
Ethan.

15:12.045 --> 15:14.747
Sounds great.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.916
Is it Mr. Tucker?
Is he dead?

15:16.916 --> 15:18.785
Do we have
to postpone the wedding?

15:18.785 --> 15:20.453
No.

15:20.453 --> 15:22.355
Mr. Tucker is just fine,
thank goodness.

15:22.355 --> 15:23.690
The surgery
was a success.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.158
Thank goodness!

15:25.158 --> 15:27.460
Unfortunately, we
do not have time

15:27.460 --> 15:29.929
to celebrate this wonderful
news as, once again,

15:29.929 --> 15:31.999
Zoe Hart is hell-bent
on destroying me.

15:31.999 --> 15:33.266
What's she done now?

15:33.266 --> 15:34.701
It's not about
what she's done.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.536
It's what she's
 about to do.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.538
What is she about to do?

15:41.008 --> 15:43.010
Never mind.

15:43.010 --> 15:46.213
Now that she and George
are getting so close,

15:46.213 --> 15:49.049
she will have the
opportunity to do it,

15:49.049 --> 15:51.051
which is why

15:51.051 --> 15:56.023
we have to bring down
Zoe Hart once and for all.

16:01.061 --> 16:03.263
(sighs)
(door opens)

16:06.633 --> 16:07.734
So? Tell me everything.

16:07.734 --> 16:10.337
Uh, Mr. Tucker's
surgery was a success.

16:10.337 --> 16:12.072
Well, I know that. I'm talking
about the big blowout.

16:12.072 --> 16:14.741
I mean, did you cry?
Did he cry? What did you say?

16:14.741 --> 16:17.510
What did he say?
You know, actually, it
wasn't that big a deal.

16:17.510 --> 16:21.214
Really? 'Cause it seemed like
an awfully big deal yesterday.

16:21.214 --> 16:24.417
You know, it's possible
that I may have overreacted.

16:24.417 --> 16:27.087
Ethan and I are going
to be friends.

16:27.087 --> 16:29.456
Oh, that's lovely.
Who's Ethan?

16:29.456 --> 16:30.457
My father.

16:30.457 --> 16:31.524
I see.

16:31.524 --> 16:33.560
Well, actually,
it-it kind of makes sense,

16:33.560 --> 16:36.329
you know, because technically,
he's not my real father.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.065
So it was unfair
of me to yell at him

16:38.065 --> 16:40.267
as if he were my father
since he's not.

16:40.267 --> 16:41.501
'Cause he's Ethan.

16:41.501 --> 16:44.003
Right. My friend
and colleague.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.106
See, it's all very civilized.

16:47.607 --> 16:49.509
Uh, this may be none
of my business,

16:49.509 --> 16:51.111
but that's a
load of crap.

16:51.111 --> 16:53.113
No judgment, obviously.

16:53.113 --> 16:54.581
Zoe, I got two kids.

16:54.581 --> 16:57.250
One of 'em, I gave birth
to, and the other I adopted.

16:57.250 --> 16:58.685
And guess what?

16:58.685 --> 16:59.986
They're both my kids.

16:59.986 --> 17:03.190
Being a parent is about a hell
of a lot more than biology.

17:03.190 --> 17:04.557
That man is your father.

17:04.557 --> 17:07.327
Doesn't matter about
what some blood test says.

17:07.327 --> 17:09.896
Look, he's offering me
something here, Addy.

17:09.896 --> 17:12.632
A chance for us to have
something instead of nothing.

17:12.632 --> 17:13.833
I'm gonna take it.

17:13.833 --> 17:16.769
And it would be great
if you could be happy for me.

17:16.769 --> 17:19.271
Well, if you're happy,
I'm happy.

17:19.271 --> 17:21.741
I just hope
you don't wake up one day

17:21.741 --> 17:24.577
and find you've still got
all this anger inside you.

17:24.577 --> 17:25.978
I keep a lot inside.

17:25.978 --> 17:29.216
How else would I live
in BlueBell?

17:32.051 --> 17:33.753
CRICKETT:
 Number 37:

17:33.753 --> 17:35.322
Water boarding.

17:35.322 --> 17:37.257
Many politicians are still
debating the ethics

17:37.257 --> 17:39.626
of this particular form
of torture, but...

17:39.626 --> 17:40.993
Uh, next.

17:40.993 --> 17:43.130
Right.

17:43.130 --> 17:45.165
Number 38:
The Jenna.

17:45.165 --> 17:47.134
Ooh, I used this one
on Jenna Richman

17:47.134 --> 17:48.535
in our last pageant together.

17:48.535 --> 17:50.837
It does require pepper spray
and a sanitary napkin...

17:50.837 --> 17:54.441
Okay, enough. Enough,
enough, enough, enough.

17:54.441 --> 17:56.409
While I appreciate
the quantity

17:56.409 --> 17:58.911
of ideas that you have
come up with, dear,

17:58.911 --> 18:00.447
if we attempted
half of them,

18:00.447 --> 18:02.182
Zoe Hart would
laugh in our faces.

18:02.182 --> 18:04.217
And the other half--
though they would be fun--

18:04.217 --> 18:05.352
would get us arrested.

18:05.352 --> 18:07.554
But A for effort, dear.

18:08.921 --> 18:11.424
Oh, my God.

18:12.559 --> 18:14.561
The answer's so obvious
I can't believe

18:14.561 --> 18:16.196
I didn't think about it earlier.

18:16.196 --> 18:18.898
Well, what is it?

18:18.898 --> 18:22.169
I... am gonna make...

18:22.169 --> 18:24.871
Zoe Hart... my best friend.

18:24.871 --> 18:27.640
But that is the opposite
of what you asked me to do.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.609
I would have made
a totally different list.

18:29.609 --> 18:30.710
Oh, Crickett,

18:30.710 --> 18:33.346
you know that saying--
keep your friends close,

18:33.346 --> 18:36.216
and your enemies closer?

18:36.216 --> 18:38.518
Well, that's
what I'm going to do.

18:39.486 --> 18:41.188
George, I came here to tell you

18:41.188 --> 18:42.489
that you were right.

18:42.489 --> 18:44.457
I've been acting like

18:44.457 --> 18:47.594
a petulant little girl
when it comes to Zoe Hart.

18:47.594 --> 18:49.229
I know that

18:49.229 --> 18:50.763
nothing is going on
between you two,

18:50.763 --> 18:54.367
and it is just silly of me
to act so terrible to her

18:54.367 --> 18:57.904
when she has been so good
to our family.

19:01.508 --> 19:03.710
Do you really mean that?

19:03.710 --> 19:05.245
I do.

19:05.245 --> 19:07.847
And... I want
to make things right,

19:07.847 --> 19:12.352
so I was thinking that maybe
I could host a dinner,

19:12.352 --> 19:14.254
um, for Zoe
and for her father.

19:14.254 --> 19:17.224
But I mean,
if I asked Zoe,

19:17.224 --> 19:19.592
there's no way
that she would come.

19:19.592 --> 19:22.495
But you know,
if-if maybe you did,

19:22.495 --> 19:24.497
then...

19:26.299 --> 19:27.867
I mean, I could do that,

19:27.867 --> 19:30.770
but Lemon, if this is just
another one of your games,

19:30.770 --> 19:32.472
then I don't...
It's not.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.309
Okay.

19:36.309 --> 19:38.211
Okay. I'll, uh...

19:38.211 --> 19:40.313
I'll go over there later
and ask her,

19:40.313 --> 19:42.181
and I'll tell you
what she says.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.183
Really?

19:44.183 --> 19:45.752
Oh. Okay, great.

19:45.752 --> 19:48.288
Well, um, I'll start working
on the menu, then.

19:48.288 --> 19:50.823
(laughs)

19:52.292 --> 19:53.626
(knocking)
(clearing throat)

19:54.661 --> 19:56.896
Am I early?

19:56.896 --> 19:58.064
No.

19:58.064 --> 19:59.599
Come in. Sit down.

19:59.599 --> 20:01.167
Make yourself
comfortable.

20:01.167 --> 20:03.603
(clears throat)

20:03.603 --> 20:06.706
I figured that we could have
a quick tour of Bluebell,

20:06.706 --> 20:09.309
and then, you know, maybe
find somewhere and have dinner.

20:09.309 --> 20:10.543
Although I
should warn you.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.445
There are only two
places to eat,

20:12.445 --> 20:16.316
and one restaurant is a bar,
so really only one restaurant.

20:16.316 --> 20:18.184
I'll let you decide.

20:18.184 --> 20:20.420
Um, Fancie's it is.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.322
I, uh, like your place,
by the way.

20:22.322 --> 20:24.657
It's very homey.
Oh, thank... Oh!

20:24.657 --> 20:26.025
Whoa! (laughs)

20:26.025 --> 20:27.294
Sorry.

20:27.294 --> 20:28.761
It's a little messy.

20:28.761 --> 20:30.663
I was just trying
to clean it up.
What's this?

20:30.663 --> 20:31.664
What?

20:33.199 --> 20:35.468
Oh.

20:35.468 --> 20:37.437
I'm sorry. I didn't know
that was out here.

20:37.437 --> 20:39.939
You're changing your name?

20:39.939 --> 20:41.941
What's wrong with Zoe?

20:41.941 --> 20:44.544
Not my first name.

20:48.147 --> 20:51.017
Hey, as long as you keep
"doctor" in there somewhere.

20:51.017 --> 20:54.120
Guarantees you a table
anywhere in New York.

20:54.120 --> 20:57.424
Right. I'll remember that.

20:58.858 --> 21:02.729
So, uh, what's up first
on the BlueBell tour?

21:02.729 --> 21:04.196
Are we heading over
to your practice?

21:04.196 --> 21:06.666
Actually, you know what?

21:06.666 --> 21:10.002
All of a sudden,
I'm not feeling all that well.

21:10.002 --> 21:11.604
Oh, no. Really?

21:11.604 --> 21:12.839
Yeah.

21:14.140 --> 21:16.275
Hey.

21:16.275 --> 21:17.777
Hey.
Hi.

21:17.777 --> 21:20.647
Um, I catch y'all
at a bad time?

21:20.647 --> 21:21.981
No, no. What's up?

21:21.981 --> 21:23.282
Um, well,

21:23.282 --> 21:24.817
I know it is extremely
short notice,

21:24.817 --> 21:27.086
but I was hoping to
convince you and Dr. Hart

21:27.086 --> 21:30.857
to join us at the Breeland
estate this evening for a dinner

21:30.857 --> 21:31.891
in your honor.

21:31.891 --> 21:33.893
What?
Well, just

21:33.893 --> 21:36.496
to thank you for everything
y'all did for my dad.

21:36.496 --> 21:38.264
That's very
generous of you,

21:38.264 --> 21:39.932
but unfortunately,
Zoe is not feeling

21:39.932 --> 21:41.300
all that well.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.302
Oh, it's not that big of a deal.
Just a little headache.

21:43.302 --> 21:44.971
Oh, okay, well,
dinner's not gonna be

21:44.971 --> 21:46.806
for a little while, so maybe if
you're feeling better by then...

21:46.806 --> 21:49.075
I mean, I don't
want to push you.

21:49.075 --> 21:52.311
Um, why don't I let you rest
and we can skip the tour

21:52.311 --> 21:54.881
and then we can all
have dinner together?

21:56.248 --> 21:57.917
In a big group, right?

21:57.917 --> 21:59.018
Sounds good.

21:59.018 --> 22:00.186
The more the merrier.

22:00.186 --> 22:01.521
Fantastic.
All right,

22:01.521 --> 22:03.255
I'll let Lemon know,
and then, uh,

22:03.255 --> 22:04.591
does 7:30 work for y'all?

22:04.591 --> 22:05.825
Yeah, it works for me.
Me, too.

22:05.825 --> 22:06.726
Great.

22:06.726 --> 22:08.160
Well, then
I'll see you later.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.028
'Kay.

22:09.028 --> 22:10.997
Okay.

22:20.707 --> 22:22.709
Are you sure
this is food?

22:22.709 --> 22:26.278
Because I have never
seen these words in
any cookbooks I know.

22:26.278 --> 22:28.114
Kugel. Kasha varnishkas.

22:28.114 --> 22:31.283
Brisket. It is the
food of Zoe's people.

22:31.283 --> 22:34.754
The idea is to make
her feel comfortable
as fast as possible.

22:34.754 --> 22:37.624
And you're sure all this starch
is gonna make Zoe like you?

22:37.624 --> 22:40.827
Well, I mean, obviously,
we're not gonna become
best friends right away,

22:40.827 --> 22:43.730
but the idea tonight is
just lay the foundation,

22:43.730 --> 22:46.633
compliment her clothing,
feign interest in her career,

22:46.633 --> 22:49.502
and then stick up for her when
Daddy says something horrible.

22:49.502 --> 22:50.970
And then hopefully,
in a week or two

22:50.970 --> 22:53.205
I should be able to
invite her to our wedding.

22:53.205 --> 22:55.174
You want her at your wedding?!

22:55.174 --> 22:57.810
Well, of course I don't
want her at my wedding.

22:57.810 --> 23:00.212
It's just the only
thing I could think of

23:00.212 --> 23:02.615
to keep her away from George.

23:02.615 --> 23:05.585
I mean, a girl can't
break up a wedding

23:05.585 --> 23:07.854
that she's invited to attend.

23:07.854 --> 23:09.188
Can she?

23:09.188 --> 23:11.223
You're a genius.

23:11.223 --> 23:12.459
(laughs)

23:12.459 --> 23:14.160
* *

23:22.502 --> 23:25.071
I-I want to bathe in this.

23:25.071 --> 23:26.305
(laughs)

23:26.305 --> 23:28.040
Ah, she's a beaut,
ain't she?

23:28.040 --> 23:30.176
Can you taste
the lavender in there?

23:30.176 --> 23:33.846
It's real subtle, but
I think it balances
out the flavor nicely.

23:33.846 --> 23:36.516
Wade, my friend,
you have a gift.

23:36.516 --> 23:38.485
No, man, you know,
it's just booze.

23:38.485 --> 23:40.787
Don't take much to
make it taste good.

23:40.787 --> 23:42.755
No, I disagree;
this takes talent.

23:42.755 --> 23:44.791
And you have clearly got it.

23:44.791 --> 23:47.927
Just stupid fun,
man, that's all.

23:50.396 --> 23:51.931
Look, here's the thing.

23:51.931 --> 23:55.868
When I was a kid, I used to love
throwing the football around

23:55.868 --> 23:57.804
in the backyard
with my brothers.

23:57.804 --> 24:01.240
And at the time, you know,
I thought I was just goofing off

24:01.240 --> 24:02.408
and having fun.

24:02.408 --> 24:03.976
I had no idea
all that fun

24:03.976 --> 24:06.212
was gonna turn into
a career in the NFL.

24:06.212 --> 24:10.016
Point is, you never know
where all this could lead, man.

24:11.818 --> 24:15.354
Uh, y-you know, uh...
I'm just bartending

24:15.354 --> 24:19.091
while I figure out what I'm
doing with the rest of my life.

24:19.091 --> 24:20.426
Yeah.

24:20.426 --> 24:22.461
But, uh, hey...

24:22.461 --> 24:24.797
try this on for size.

24:24.797 --> 24:27.066
All right, what
we got here...

24:27.066 --> 24:30.870
is something extra special,
fresh off the presses.

24:32.438 --> 24:34.641
WADE: Ba-blam.

24:36.308 --> 24:37.644
Oh, there you are, Daddy.

24:37.644 --> 24:39.278
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

24:39.278 --> 24:42.281
Oh, sweetheart, I just
came home from a very
long day at work.

24:42.281 --> 24:46.118
I just want to sit down and
enjoy this scotch before
the vultures descend.

24:46.118 --> 24:47.353
Of course.

24:47.353 --> 24:50.790
I just need your help with
one itty-bitty little thing.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.492
You were there the other night

24:53.492 --> 24:55.461
when Zoe Hart all but proclaimed

24:55.461 --> 24:57.229
her undying love for my George.

24:57.229 --> 24:59.398
Yes, I was fortunate enough
to have witnessed

24:59.398 --> 25:01.000
that deeply
uncomfortable moment.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.035
But, sugar, you
don't have to worry

25:03.035 --> 25:05.037
about a thing.
Maybe not, but...

25:05.037 --> 25:06.906
our relationship is
in a vulnerable state,

25:06.906 --> 25:10.276
and I know for a fact
that Zoe Hart is trying
to destroy it.

25:10.276 --> 25:14.581
Well, then why are we
having her over for dinner?

25:14.581 --> 25:15.982
Oh, no.

25:15.982 --> 25:18.718
No. No, no, no.
Oh, it is gonna be

25:18.718 --> 25:20.152
a lovely dinner, but...

25:20.152 --> 25:24.523
I just need you to get upset
when I mention the fact

25:24.523 --> 25:28.795
that your patient Maggie
Thornhill is thinking about
leaving you for Zoe Hart.

25:28.795 --> 25:30.329
What? Well, since when?

25:30.329 --> 25:31.998
No, no, no, she's
not, she's not.
Maggie...?

25:31.998 --> 25:33.766
I'm just gonna say
she is,
When did this happen?

25:33.766 --> 25:35.134
and you need
to get upset about it.

25:35.134 --> 25:37.136
Well, I am upset.
Why would she do that?

25:37.136 --> 25:40.740
I've been her doctor
for, what, 20,
25 years...
(frustrated grunt)

25:40.740 --> 25:42.208
Okay, just follow my lead,

25:42.208 --> 25:44.210
and we'll be fine.

25:44.210 --> 25:45.144
(doorbell rings)

25:45.144 --> 25:46.646
Oh! They're here!

25:46.646 --> 25:48.848
(exhales quietly)

25:55.487 --> 25:57.323
That is such
a beautiful purse.

25:57.323 --> 26:00.326
Let me take that for you;
I'll put it away.

26:00.326 --> 26:02.028
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

26:03.029 --> 26:06.065
Uh, we're having
latkes for dinner?

26:06.065 --> 26:08.500
Oh, yes. This is
just the amuse-bouche.

26:08.500 --> 26:12.204
I thought that your father
would appreciate a kosher meal.

26:12.204 --> 26:14.273
Oh, he's not Jewish;
my mother is.

26:14.273 --> 26:15.541
Really?

26:15.541 --> 26:16.643
Well, that is fascinating.

26:16.643 --> 26:17.777
There is just so much

26:17.777 --> 26:19.211
I don't know
about you, Zoe Hart.

26:19.211 --> 26:21.380
How about we sit
next to each other at dinner,

26:21.380 --> 26:23.549
and you can tell me more
about your ethnic origins.

26:23.549 --> 26:27.519
(pager beeping)
Why don't we all get started
on the first course.

26:27.519 --> 26:29.656
Oh, um, Daddy,
before I forget.

26:29.656 --> 26:31.423
I saw your patient
Maggie Thornhill

26:31.423 --> 26:32.424
this morning...
Oh, no.

26:32.424 --> 26:33.960
ZOE:
What is it?

26:33.960 --> 26:36.295
Well, uh, y'all are
gonna have to excuse me.

26:36.295 --> 26:38.698
Anna Carver's water just broke;
she's having twins.

26:38.698 --> 26:39.832
(chuckles)

26:39.832 --> 26:41.233
Look at that!
But, Daddy? Daddy?

26:41.233 --> 26:43.035
Do you need help?
I've been delivering babies

26:43.035 --> 26:44.436
my whole life--
haven't needed help yet.

26:44.436 --> 26:46.072
(laughter)
Ethan, uh,

26:46.072 --> 26:48.808
thank you, pleasure.
And, everybody, just
enjoy your dinner.

26:48.808 --> 26:49.976
Excuse me.
You bet.

26:49.976 --> 26:51.844
Good luck, Brick.
Good night.

26:51.844 --> 26:53.980
(George chuckles)

26:53.980 --> 26:55.414
GEORGE: Anyway,
um, I just...

26:55.414 --> 26:57.149
just wanted
to say thank you.

26:57.149 --> 27:00.019
It was so great of you
to come all the way down here

27:00.019 --> 27:01.253
just for my
family. I...

27:01.253 --> 27:03.656
You know, I hear from
people all the time

27:03.656 --> 27:05.858
that surgeons are cold
and selfish people,

27:05.858 --> 27:08.995
and I have to tell you,
from my experience,

27:08.995 --> 27:10.997
it couldn't be
further from the truth.

27:10.997 --> 27:13.065
How many surgeons
do you know?

27:13.065 --> 27:14.734
Well, uh...

27:14.734 --> 27:16.468
(laughs):
two, I guess.

27:16.468 --> 27:17.937
You and Zoe.
And how well

27:17.937 --> 27:19.972
do you know Zoe?

27:19.972 --> 27:21.507
Uh...

27:21.507 --> 27:23.175
I'm not so sure what you mean.

27:23.175 --> 27:25.577
I mean, your relationship
must be fairly significant

27:25.577 --> 27:27.346
for her to have called me here.

27:27.346 --> 27:29.148
Zoe doesn't ask for
favors very often.

27:29.148 --> 27:33.319
Oh, I mean, you know, it was
very generous of... of her

27:33.319 --> 27:34.453
as well.
It's...

27:34.453 --> 27:37.489
Would've made sense if
you two were an item.

27:37.489 --> 27:39.158
(laughs)

27:39.158 --> 27:42.494
Uh, yeah, you know, I could see
how you might think that,

27:42.494 --> 27:43.763
but no, I'm...

27:43.763 --> 27:45.631
I'm with Lemon, so...
The blond one.

27:45.631 --> 27:46.966
Yeah, I got that.

27:46.966 --> 27:51.237
My point is, Zoe must care
for you a great deal.

27:52.638 --> 27:55.607
(laughs) No, we are...
 we're, we're just good friends.

27:55.607 --> 27:57.576
That's all.

27:57.576 --> 27:58.711
Good.

27:58.711 --> 28:00.646
(phone vibrates)

28:00.646 --> 28:02.514
Sorry.
Uh...

28:02.514 --> 28:05.484
I freshen you up there, or...?
Excuse me,
I have to take this.

28:05.484 --> 28:07.286
Oh, yeah. Of course.

28:07.286 --> 28:09.121
(laughs)

28:17.964 --> 28:19.832
Oh, there you are.

28:19.832 --> 28:21.700
It's a pretty
painting, isn't it?

28:21.700 --> 28:24.303
Used to be in Daddy's study,
but I thought that it deserved

28:24.303 --> 28:26.773
to be on more of a
prominent display.

28:26.773 --> 28:27.940
Yeah, it's nice.

28:27.940 --> 28:30.109
My goodness, Zoe Hart,
there is just...

28:30.109 --> 28:32.178
so much that I
don't know about you.

28:32.178 --> 28:34.046
You are just
a connoisseur of art.

28:34.046 --> 28:35.982
(gasps)
Oh, my goodness,

28:35.982 --> 28:37.416
where are my manners?

28:37.416 --> 28:40.452
I still have not yet offered
you a tour of our estate.

28:42.789 --> 28:43.956
Is everything all right?
A patient

28:43.956 --> 28:45.691
of mine in New York;
I had to take it.

28:45.691 --> 28:48.527
Oh, you doctors--
never a moment of peace.

28:48.527 --> 28:51.197
Okay, now that you're back,
we can officially start dinner.

28:51.197 --> 28:52.198
Actually, I need

28:52.198 --> 28:55.367
to speak to Zoe for
a moment in private.

28:55.367 --> 28:56.769
Of course.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.413
(door closes)

29:07.413 --> 29:09.048
I think we should go,

29:09.048 --> 29:11.050
don't you?
We can't leave yet.

29:11.050 --> 29:12.718
Dinner hasn't even started.

29:12.718 --> 29:14.053
Is there a problem?

29:14.053 --> 29:17.289
Yes. Actually, being
here feels very...

29:17.289 --> 29:18.357
inappropriate.

29:18.357 --> 29:20.592
What's inappropriate?
Please,

29:20.592 --> 29:22.528
it's obvious that you
have feelings for a man

29:22.528 --> 29:24.696
that is about to be
married to another woman.

29:24.696 --> 29:26.532
So?

29:26.532 --> 29:29.936
So I'm worried that you might
be getting into a situation

29:29.936 --> 29:31.737
where you could
get hurt, Zoe.

29:31.737 --> 29:33.339
Wait, why should
you be worried?

29:33.339 --> 29:35.474
I mean, we're only
colleagues, remember?

29:36.108 --> 29:38.077
Zoe, look...
What?

29:38.077 --> 29:41.447
The way you're talking
to me right now, it's
almost like you're my dad!

29:41.447 --> 29:43.449
But that is crazy.

29:43.449 --> 29:44.984
Right, Ethan?

29:45.818 --> 29:47.753
Okay. I-I...

29:47.753 --> 29:49.856
I can see that you're upset.

29:49.856 --> 29:51.623
Oh, yeah? Well,
why should I be upset?

29:51.623 --> 29:54.726
Because the one man
that I have looked
up to my entire life,

29:54.726 --> 29:57.964
the man who I thought
was my father up
until eight months ago,

29:57.964 --> 29:59.231
abandoned me?

29:59.231 --> 30:01.767
Stopped returning
my phone calls

30:01.767 --> 30:03.535
without any explanation
as to why!

30:03.535 --> 30:05.171
Turned me into the kind of girl

30:05.171 --> 30:06.705
who was so desperate
for affection,

30:06.705 --> 30:09.441
she doesn't know how to be
in relationships with men!

30:09.441 --> 30:11.643
Look, I didn't know
that you were angry.

30:11.643 --> 30:13.212
Of course I'm angry!

30:13.212 --> 30:14.546
I have every right
to be, okay?

30:14.546 --> 30:16.648
I don't want to be
your frickin' friend.

30:16.648 --> 30:18.017
In fact, I would
rather go back

30:18.017 --> 30:19.785
to having no relationship
with you at all

30:19.785 --> 30:21.320
than having
some crappy fake one.

30:21.320 --> 30:24.023
So if you have nothing else
to say to me,

30:24.023 --> 30:26.158
why don't you
go back to New York.

30:30.062 --> 30:32.064
Lemon! You know what?

30:32.064 --> 30:34.566
I-I think I will take
that tour, after all.

30:43.309 --> 30:46.845
(lively country intro playing)

30:46.845 --> 30:50.282
* They say that playing
with fire kind of like we are *

30:50.282 --> 30:52.818
* Leaves you bleeding, kind of
feel more, did it feel good? *

30:52.818 --> 30:55.854
* Was it everything
you thought you ever needed? *

30:55.854 --> 30:57.456
* You can't sneak
out that door *

30:57.456 --> 30:58.958
* Get back here for some more *

30:58.958 --> 31:00.592
* I don't hold back *

31:00.592 --> 31:02.861
* Never gonna find another lover
like me, you'll see *

31:02.861 --> 31:04.196
* I'm gonna love you *

31:04.196 --> 31:07.299
* Till you're sick,
sick, sick of me *

31:07.299 --> 31:10.069
* I'm gonna love you
till you're sick, sick *

31:10.069 --> 31:11.737
* Sick of me... *
MAYNARD: All right,

31:11.737 --> 31:15.407
all right, all right, now,
our final signature cocktail

31:15.407 --> 31:16.608
of the evening is

31:16.608 --> 31:18.410
brought to you by Shelley Ng.

31:18.410 --> 31:19.811
I call it...

31:19.811 --> 31:21.547
The Vanilla Viper!

31:21.547 --> 31:22.748
(whooping)

31:22.748 --> 31:25.084
Ooh! It tastes like a cupcake.

31:25.084 --> 31:26.885
That was the idea.
MAYNARD: All right, all right,

31:26.885 --> 31:30.489
now all the drinks are in--
it's time to cast your votes.

31:30.489 --> 31:33.492
All those in favor
of Wade Kinsella,

31:33.492 --> 31:34.693
raise your hand!

31:34.693 --> 31:37.563
(cheers, shouts, whoops)

31:37.563 --> 31:38.965
LAVON:
Come on, come on!

31:38.965 --> 31:40.299
All right, all right,

31:40.299 --> 31:42.568
those in favor of Shelley Ng,

31:42.568 --> 31:43.669
raise your hands!

31:43.669 --> 31:46.238
(loud cheering)

31:47.206 --> 31:48.674
Congratulations, Shelley Ng.

31:48.674 --> 31:50.442
You are our winner.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.646
There something wrong
with this girl?

31:54.646 --> 31:59.485
* I'm gonna love you till
you're sick, sick, sick of me *

31:59.485 --> 32:01.153
Sorry about that, man.

32:01.153 --> 32:02.554
I thought you had it in the bag.

32:02.554 --> 32:03.822
It's all right.

32:03.822 --> 32:06.258
It's, uh, it's only a contest.

32:06.258 --> 32:09.061
I can be
your consolation prize.

32:09.061 --> 32:11.630
Well, appreciate it, Wanda.

32:11.630 --> 32:13.632
Maybe some other time.

32:16.902 --> 32:18.404
And the staircase is original.

32:18.404 --> 32:20.106
It was hand carved
by my granddaddy

32:20.106 --> 32:21.840
many, many, many years ago.

32:21.840 --> 32:23.275
You know what, uh,
thanks for the tour,

32:23.275 --> 32:24.576
but I think I'm
gonna get going.

32:24.576 --> 32:26.245
No, but we haven't
had dinner yet,

32:26.245 --> 32:27.813
and I made all this food
for our party.

32:27.813 --> 32:29.748
I don't think there's
much of a party anymore.

32:29.748 --> 32:31.617
It's just me, you, and George.

32:31.617 --> 32:32.784
So what?

32:32.784 --> 32:33.952
You know what?

32:33.952 --> 32:35.287
I've been thinking
the three of us

32:35.287 --> 32:37.256
need to spend
more time together anyway.

32:37.256 --> 32:38.590
And...

32:40.892 --> 32:44.463
...I have made a huge...

32:44.463 --> 32:46.632
error in judgment,

32:46.632 --> 32:49.735
and you simply

32:49.735 --> 32:52.271
must come to our wedding.

32:52.271 --> 32:54.140
(laughs and snorts)
Sorry.

32:54.140 --> 32:55.641
What's so funny?
Come on.

32:55.641 --> 32:56.742
You want me at your wedding

32:56.742 --> 32:58.677
about as much as I want
to go to your wedding.

32:58.677 --> 33:00.612
Oh, so you don't want
to come to my wedding now?

33:00.612 --> 33:02.648
Well, frankly, that just
really hurts my feelings.

33:02.648 --> 33:03.815
Cut the crap, Lemon.

33:03.815 --> 33:04.950
Look, I don't know

33:04.950 --> 33:06.385
what crazy plan
you had for tonight,

33:06.385 --> 33:07.986
but I'm sure there was
something devious going on.

33:07.986 --> 33:10.889
How dare you, after everything
that I've done tonight

33:10.889 --> 33:12.424
to make everything...
Look,

33:12.424 --> 33:15.194
I know that you
know that I know.

33:15.194 --> 33:17.329
And you're probably thinking

33:17.329 --> 33:18.764
that I'm going to tell George.

33:18.764 --> 33:21.267
But there's something
that you need to understand.

33:21.267 --> 33:25.371
I'm never telling George
or anyone else, for that matter.

33:27.073 --> 33:29.408
Well, forgive me
if I don't believe you.

33:32.044 --> 33:33.379
Why would you do that for me?

33:33.379 --> 33:35.147
I'm not doing it for you.

33:35.147 --> 33:37.516
But Lavon is my best friend,

33:37.516 --> 33:39.651
and I would never
betray his trust.

33:39.651 --> 33:41.987
Plus, why would I want
to be the person

33:41.987 --> 33:43.689
to tell George?

33:43.689 --> 33:45.057
Why wouldn't you?

33:45.057 --> 33:46.558
Because I have no interest

33:46.558 --> 33:48.960
in being the person
to break George's heart.

33:48.960 --> 33:51.330
But, for what it's worth,

33:51.330 --> 33:54.500
I do think
that you should tell him,

34:18.456 --> 34:19.858
Hey.

34:19.858 --> 34:20.926
Glass of wine?

34:20.926 --> 34:22.128
Shot of tequila?

34:22.128 --> 34:24.029
Oh, rough night?

34:24.029 --> 34:25.630
Weird night.
Huh.

34:25.630 --> 34:27.299
Turns out that Lemon

34:27.299 --> 34:30.168
isn't the complete psychopath
I thought she was.

34:30.168 --> 34:32.704
But unfortunately,
my father is.

34:32.704 --> 34:34.606
You were

34:34.606 --> 34:36.641
with Lemon?

34:36.641 --> 34:38.277
And how is she?

34:38.277 --> 34:40.612
(laughing)
Are you drunk?

34:40.612 --> 34:41.746
We're, uh,

34:41.746 --> 34:42.781
we're calling it tipsy.

34:42.781 --> 34:43.815
He is the mayor,

34:43.815 --> 34:45.184
after all.
Keep it down.

34:45.184 --> 34:46.851
I've never seen drunk Lavon.

34:46.851 --> 34:48.554
He's so cute.

34:48.554 --> 34:50.656
Thank you.

34:50.656 --> 34:52.658
I like myself.

34:52.658 --> 34:53.925
Oh, boy.

34:53.925 --> 34:55.627
So, I take it, uh...

34:55.627 --> 34:57.896
I take it things didn't go
too well with your dad?

34:57.896 --> 35:00.065
Turns out that you were wrong.

35:00.065 --> 35:01.633
I was able to tell him off.

35:01.633 --> 35:04.370
But, in doing so,
I completely ruined any chance

35:04.370 --> 35:06.405
of having a relationship
with the man.

35:07.706 --> 35:08.840
I'm sorry.

35:08.840 --> 35:10.742
No, that's okay,
it's better this way.

35:10.742 --> 35:12.911
You know, I would rather
be honest than angry.

35:12.911 --> 35:13.812
That's beautiful.

35:13.812 --> 35:16.548
Honest and angry.

35:16.548 --> 35:18.517
Mmm, damn that's good.

35:18.517 --> 35:20.386
I am going to go home,
though,

35:20.386 --> 35:22.921
and erase the last 48 hours
from my mind.

35:22.921 --> 35:24.823
See you guys later.

35:24.823 --> 35:26.392
Bye-e-e-e.

35:27.759 --> 35:31.062
Guess you won't be needing this,
so I'll just take it.

35:31.062 --> 35:33.365
That's all.

35:34.500 --> 35:36.802
You-you didn't
serve this tonight.

35:40.071 --> 35:41.207
You tanked the contest.

35:41.207 --> 35:42.974
Can't prove that.

35:42.974 --> 35:44.410
Wait, well, I don't understand

35:44.410 --> 35:45.911
why would you do
something like that?

35:45.911 --> 35:49.381
Look, I'm not gonna give
Mayner my best stuff.

35:49.381 --> 35:52.384
I got to save some of my
own ideas for my own menu.

35:53.118 --> 35:54.953
For when I open my own bar.

35:54.953 --> 35:56.688
Oh.

35:56.688 --> 35:57.756
Huh? Huh?

35:57.756 --> 35:58.857
Love it.

35:58.857 --> 35:59.891
Love it.

35:59.891 --> 36:01.427
Love it.
Come on, now.

36:11.537 --> 36:14.039
People really do
leave their doors open

36:14.039 --> 36:15.807
in small towns, huh?

36:20.612 --> 36:22.448
I'm not good
with confrontations.

36:22.448 --> 36:25.551
I think that one
of the reasons that I, uh,

36:25.551 --> 36:28.587
chose cardiothoracics
was because I knew that

36:28.587 --> 36:31.156
by the time my patients
got to me,

36:31.156 --> 36:33.792
they wouldn't have time
to argue.

36:33.792 --> 36:35.861
I don't understand.

36:35.861 --> 36:38.830
I knew what I was
offering you was crap.

36:38.830 --> 36:40.699
I was just hoping
you would take it

36:40.699 --> 36:43.269
so that we wouldn't have
to do this part.

36:43.269 --> 36:46.872
(sighs) This part is hard.

36:46.872 --> 36:49.207
Which part?

36:49.207 --> 36:51.277
The part where I tell you
how wrong I was.

36:51.277 --> 36:53.312
That I screwed everything up,

36:53.312 --> 36:54.613
and I didn't know how

36:54.613 --> 36:59.017
to make it any better,
so I just...

36:59.017 --> 37:00.752
didn't.

37:02.621 --> 37:03.455
But...

37:03.455 --> 37:06.191
you're right to hate me, Zoe.

37:06.191 --> 37:09.561
I don't hate you.

37:09.561 --> 37:13.198
I just don't understand
why you did what you did.

37:13.198 --> 37:14.833
I was mad

37:14.833 --> 37:16.868
at your mom.

37:16.868 --> 37:19.438
And then at you, even though
it wasn't your fault.

37:19.438 --> 37:21.172
I couldn't even
look at you

37:21.172 --> 37:24.310
after I found out
the truth.

37:24.310 --> 37:26.612
And then it just became...

37:26.612 --> 37:29.915
easier to take surgeries
out of town.

37:29.915 --> 37:31.483
To do lectures.

37:31.483 --> 37:33.819
Anything to keep me away
from dealing with you,

37:33.819 --> 37:34.653
because...

37:34.653 --> 37:38.089
I literally didn't know...

37:38.089 --> 37:41.493
how to be your father anymore.

37:41.493 --> 37:44.563
So, I just quit.

37:44.563 --> 37:46.197
And then you called me
the other day,

37:46.197 --> 37:49.968
and I thought maybe I could find
another way to be with you.

37:49.968 --> 37:52.170
You seemed open to the idea.

37:52.170 --> 37:54.005
But when I saw you with George,

37:54.005 --> 37:56.675
I just felt so protective,

37:56.675 --> 37:59.277
and my paternal instincts
just kicked in,

37:59.277 --> 38:00.746
and I didn't want
to see you get hurt.

38:00.746 --> 38:03.782
And I know
that's not fair.

38:03.782 --> 38:06.785
Because I know
that I have...

38:06.785 --> 38:08.987
I've hurt you more than anyone.

38:12.358 --> 38:14.593
I'm so sorry, Zoe.

38:20.999 --> 38:23.602
Do you think you could ever
be my daughter again?

38:25.136 --> 38:28.907
Even when I was mad, I never
stopped being your daughter.

38:32.678 --> 38:34.346
Then maybe you can wait
a little while

38:34.346 --> 38:35.614
before you officially change
your last name?

38:35.614 --> 38:36.748
Because I can't imagine

38:36.748 --> 38:39.418
you being anyone
other than Zoe Hart.

38:39.418 --> 38:41.687
Dr. Zoe Hart.

38:41.687 --> 38:44.022
Mister.

38:50.896 --> 38:53.599
I know these past few
days haven't been easy,

38:53.599 --> 38:57.969
and I have not
been easy on you.

38:57.969 --> 39:01.172
Baby, you have been
under so much stress.

39:01.172 --> 39:03.308
I understand.

39:03.308 --> 39:05.511
I know you do.

39:06.512 --> 39:08.046
I can't...

39:08.046 --> 39:10.982
(sighs) You're not the reason
my dad had a heart attack,

39:10.982 --> 39:14.686
and it was wrong of me
to say those things.

39:14.686 --> 39:15.987
I was just...
I was upset and...

39:15.987 --> 39:16.988
I know, baby, I know.

39:16.988 --> 39:18.590
I just was looking
for someone to blame.

39:18.590 --> 39:21.359
And this Zoe thing,
I just... I feel like...
Hey.

39:30.602 --> 39:35.140
Let's not talk about
Zoe Hart anymore.

39:36.608 --> 39:38.209
Okay.
Okay?

39:38.209 --> 39:41.179
In fact, why don't you and I

39:41.179 --> 39:42.948
head over to the Rammer Jammer,

39:42.948 --> 39:44.349
because I think

39:44.349 --> 39:47.853
that you and I need
to have a good time.

39:47.853 --> 39:48.654
Hm?

39:48.654 --> 39:50.456
I think
it sounds amazing.

39:50.456 --> 39:52.057
I do, unfortunately,

39:52.057 --> 39:54.493
I promised my mom that I'd
go back to the hospital

39:54.493 --> 39:56.628
tonight, so...
I'll go with you.

39:57.863 --> 39:58.930
No.

39:58.930 --> 40:01.266
No, you know what, I
want you to go on ahead

40:01.266 --> 40:04.503
to the Rammer Jammer; I think
you should have a good time,

40:04.503 --> 40:06.404
because, baby, hey,

40:06.404 --> 40:07.939
you deserve it.

40:07.939 --> 40:10.141
All right.

40:10.141 --> 40:11.510
Just one drink.

40:11.510 --> 40:13.479
Just one. One drink.

40:13.479 --> 40:15.681
(both chuckling)

40:15.681 --> 40:16.848
Drive safe.
I will.

40:16.848 --> 40:18.817
I'll call you
soon as I get there.

40:18.817 --> 40:19.985
I love you.

40:19.985 --> 40:21.319
Love you, too.

40:21.319 --> 40:22.387
Have fun.

40:22.387 --> 40:23.689
Not too much fun, though.

40:31.429 --> 40:33.264
Lemon.

40:33.264 --> 40:36.301
Hello, Mr. Mayor.

40:36.301 --> 40:38.336
You were right.

40:38.336 --> 40:41.306
I mean...

40:41.306 --> 40:42.808
I think you might
have been right.

40:42.808 --> 40:45.777
Have you been drinking?

40:45.777 --> 40:48.413
Well, I've been
thinking maybe...

40:48.413 --> 40:50.516
I told you about Zoe

40:50.516 --> 40:53.451
because I wanted you
to tell George.

40:53.451 --> 40:54.920
Oh...

40:59.290 --> 41:00.992
What the hell?

41:00.992 --> 41:02.561
One drink.

41:02.561 --> 41:03.829
One drink.

41:03.829 --> 41:05.964
I keep thinking about it;
would it be so bad

41:05.964 --> 41:07.566
if he found out?
Oh, Lavon, don't.

41:07.566 --> 41:09.167
'Cause if he broke up with you

41:09.167 --> 41:11.570
I would be here, Lemon.

41:11.570 --> 41:13.739
I would be here for you.

41:20.311 --> 41:21.713
I'm sorry.

41:32.290 --> 41:36.695
