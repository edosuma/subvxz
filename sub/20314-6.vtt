-Being a stay-at-home dad is
very exciting. My day starts
with...

00:05.250 --> 00:07.333
-Excuse me, um I thought this
was career day?

00:07.375 --> 00:10.750
-Jimmy! Being a stay-at-home
dad is a very big career.

00:10.792 --> 00:13.417
A very important career
to look after children.

00:13.458 --> 00:16.166
It's something we have
accepted in society now.

00:16.208 --> 00:19.166
That's not a fun job, just
because Ron doesn't get a
paycheque from some

00:19.208 --> 00:21.625
big company every week.
It still means he has a career.

00:21.667 --> 00:23.917
And that's not a lot of fun,
I might add.

00:23.959 --> 00:26.625
I couldn't imagine chasing
you kids around all day.

00:26.667 --> 00:29.125
-Really?
A stay at home dad.

00:29.166 --> 00:31.542
John is his youngest son.

00:31.583 --> 00:32.750
-What?

00:34.333 --> 00:38.125
Okay, then your other two are...
-Ah, they're away at university.

00:38.166 --> 00:40.333
-But you drive John
back and forth?

00:40.375 --> 00:42.875
-No, he drives himself.
-You make his lunch or anything?

00:42.917 --> 00:45.291
-Nah, he works, he
buys his own lunch.

00:45.333 --> 00:47.291
-He works?
-[Ron]: Yeah.

00:47.333 --> 00:50.250
-Maybe he should do career
day for us because...

00:50.291 --> 00:52.583
How do you call yourself
a stay-at-home dad?

00:52.625 --> 00:55.500
-Well, I'm a dad and
I stay at home.

00:55.542 --> 00:58.000
-'Cause you're a dad and
you stay at home.

00:58.041 --> 01:00.959
So, you put the two...
So, ah...

01:01.000 --> 01:05.041
What Ron does is called
unemployment.

01:05.083 --> 01:08.917
Which is not something
we're trying to achieve.

01:08.959 --> 01:14.166
-Nope, I'm a stay-at-home dad.
I just...I stay in the home.

01:14.208 --> 01:16.917
And I'm a dad.

Or have a meeting at a bank?

What did I sign?

-Yeah.

10:26.834 --> 10:29.000
-Super weird.
-Great.

10:29.041 --> 10:31.375
-It's not your house though,
right? Your mom owns the house?

10:31.417 --> 10:33.834
You don't have any equity?
-Not familiar with that word.

10:33.875 --> 10:36.792
Gonna look it up. Have
a good night, gentlemen.

10:36.834 --> 10:39.375
-We gotta buy this place Bill,
before someone else does.

10:39.417 --> 10:42.000
-We should own it. I've got
ten grand saved for a down
payment.

10:42.041 --> 10:44.250
-That's all we need
for a deposit.

10:44.291 --> 10:48.208
-It's all I need. You also need
ten grand and then we buy
the house.

10:48.250 --> 10:50.500
-Ha, where am I
getting ten grand?

10:50.542 --> 10:52.667
-Why'd you bring this up if
you don't have the money?

10:52.709 --> 10:55.750
-I didn't think you were going
to ask me for ten grand. I just
thought of the idea.

10:55.792 --> 10:57.834
-How do you not have ten grand?
-How do you have ten grand?

10:57.875 --> 11:01.917
-'Cause I'm an adult with a job.
I put it into my savings, how do
you not have savings?

11:01.959 --> 11:06.875
-'Cause I put my savings into
the house we currently reside
in.

11:06.917 --> 11:09.792
-The house we rent?
-Yeah.

11:09.834 --> 11:11.792
-Maybe you should look
up equity.

11:13.250 --> 11:15.166
-Maybe I will.

11:16.083 --> 11:18.250
-Hey guys, would you
mind signing this?

11:18.291 --> 11:20.667
-Ugh, birthday?
-No, Flo's retiring.

11:20.709 --> 11:23.375
-Who's Flo?
-Flo, our crossing guard.

11:23.417 --> 11:25.959
She's been with us for 25 years.
-It's not ringing a bell.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.750
-Yeah...nope.
-The sweetest 70 year
old woman ever?

11:29.792 --> 11:31.959
-Yeah, still nothing.
-Whatever, I'll sign it.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.834
-Oh good. I'm thinking about
throwing her a good-bye party.

11:34.875 --> 11:36.750
-You're not asking for
money, are ya?

11:39.000 --> 11:42.291
-You know...
[Lisa takes a deep breath]

11:42.333 --> 11:44.709
That is just unbelievable.

11:44.750 --> 11:51.083
This poor woman has sat outside
in the sleet and rain and hot
sun for years.

11:51.125 --> 11:54.417
I'll tell you who she is, she's
given us safety.

11:54.458 --> 11:58.959
And happy children. And the best
if not the last years of her
life.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.875
And for what? For what?
To just die alone?

12:01.917 --> 12:06.792
With nobody, except my three
cats and a PhD to say that I
mattered.

12:10.125 --> 12:13.750
Thank you so much, that's great.
Thanks.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.333
-That got a bit personal, right?

12:17.375 --> 12:19.083
-What?
-Yeah.

12:21.208 --> 12:25.041
-David, I need to you to tell me
how you made that kind of money
to buy a car like that.

12:25.083 --> 12:27.041
-I'm working on an
assignment right now sir.

12:27.083 --> 12:29.333
-Oh really? Well, I got a
new assignment for ya.

12:29.375 --> 12:31.834
I need to make cash fast and
you're gonna tell me how
you did that.

12:31.875 --> 12:34.041
-Well, I bought my car
short selling stocks, sir.

12:34.083 --> 12:37.041
-Okay, and what is that?
-It's essentially selling
something you don't own.

12:37.083 --> 12:39.959
-I own nothing. So this is good.
Go on.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.959
-Okay, you borrow a share of
a company you don't think is
going to do so great.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
-Okay, borrow a share.
-You sell the share you borrowed
at the current market price.

12:46.041 --> 12:49.083
The market price falls.
-[Inhales sharply]: Falls?
This doesn't sound good.

12:49.125 --> 12:51.417
-Short selling, you sell
high to buy low.

12:51.458 --> 12:54.333
-Yeah, that doesn't sound right.
-Long selling is you
buy low to sell high.

12:54.375 --> 12:57.041
-Ah, that's the one
I've heard of.
-Shorting is the opposite.

12:57.083 --> 13:00.875
You buy the stock low, to
replace the stock you borrowed.
-That I borrowed.

13:00.917 --> 13:02.959
-To sell high.
-Sell it high.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.250
-You got it.
-Yup.

13:05.291 --> 13:08.083
-Great, you'll need a
few grand to start.

13:08.125 --> 13:10.750
-I don't have a few grand.
-What, how?

13:10.792 --> 13:13.917
You're an adult, you must
have acquired some capital
over the years.

13:13.959 --> 13:16.792
-Ah, I'm a teacher.
So, no...

13:16.834 --> 13:18.917
And I thought I had a
house, but I don't.

13:18.959 --> 13:21.333
-Wow, so you're telling me other
than your teachers pension

13:21.375 --> 13:23.542
you have no retirement
savings at all?

13:23.583 --> 13:26.875
-Teachers' pension, I forgot
about that. I will cash that in,
and I will get money.

13:26.917 --> 13:30.583
-Sir, that's not a good idea.
-Because the guy running my
money is doing better than you?

13:30.625 --> 13:32.792
No he's not. I don't
even know him.

13:32.834 --> 13:34.917
-Sir, I think you should get
a professional to help you.

13:34.959 --> 13:38.417
-That costs money. Why, when I
have you you're my professional.

13:38.458 --> 13:40.917
I haven't seen anybody around
here driving a car like that.

13:40.959 --> 13:43.000
So, somebody knows
what they're talking about.

13:43.041 --> 13:45.500
Thanks for the advice.
-Hey, but sir...

13:45.542 --> 13:47.917
-[Gerry]: Nope.
-Sir.

13:47.959 --> 13:50.875
[♪ Music]

13:51.834 --> 13:53.959
-So, here's what we know.
You ready?

13:54.000 --> 13:56.375
Bobbi's phys ed printer's,
printing to the main office.
Right?

13:56.417 --> 13:59.000
-Right.
-Dwyer's printer's printing in
Simon's lab for some reason.

13:59.041 --> 14:01.125
Right?
-Right.

14:01.166 --> 14:04.458
-And Lisa's printer's printing
to the third floor for some
reason, the music room.

14:04.500 --> 14:06.750
-Where's the office printing
going Robert?

14:06.792 --> 14:09.792
-See, that's the thing of it.
Where?

14:09.834 --> 14:11.917
-Okay, this is ridiculous,
I am calling IT.

14:11.959 --> 14:14.291
-No, no, no, no, no.
We're so close.

14:14.333 --> 14:17.125
Don't you sense a
pattern is emerging?

14:17.166 --> 14:19.041
I can almost taste it.

14:20.750 --> 14:23.458
-You cashed out your pension?
-Best thing I ever did.

14:23.500 --> 14:26.583
Why am I leaving my money
in the hands of people I don't
even know?

14:26.625 --> 14:29.875
Who knows if they know what
they're doing? I found out what
to do.

14:29.917 --> 14:33.125
You short stocks. You see
that line going down?
-Mmmhmm.

14:33.166 --> 14:36.917
-That's my shorting line,
which means my profits
are going up, up, up.

14:36.959 --> 14:39.166
-Ooh, maybe I should
get in on that.

14:39.208 --> 14:42.917
I got some money set aside.
-You should, I can show you
how to do it.

14:42.959 --> 14:45.166
-[Simon]: Hmm.
-We'll both get out
of this racket.

14:45.208 --> 14:47.125
I'm getting sick of some
of these kids anyway.

14:47.166 --> 14:49.875
-Oof, me too.
-[Gerry]: Yeah.

14:52.542 --> 14:56.959
-So, I don't understand, you
buy stocks, they go down
and you make money?

14:57.041 --> 15:00.542
-The way it was explained to
me is it's the opposite of what
you'd normally do.

15:00.583 --> 15:02.875
Which is, you buy
low you sell high.
-Yeah.

15:02.917 --> 15:07.125
-This time you get it high and
I think you sell low or
something.

15:07.166 --> 15:11.959
But, the bottom line is you're
hoping that the stock does
poorly.

15:12.000 --> 15:16.917
So you buy it at this price,
you sell it at a lower price.

15:16.959 --> 15:20.000
It's called shorting.
-Excuse me, sir?

15:20.041 --> 15:22.000
-What do you want Alex?
-My father's a stock broker.

15:22.041 --> 15:24.250
-So, you want some
tips from Mr. D?
-[Laughs]: Yeah.

15:24.291 --> 15:26.709
-If you're shorting, you
don't buy the stocks,
you borrow them.

15:26.750 --> 15:29.000
-Yeah, well I don't borrow
anything.
-Bop!

15:29.041 --> 15:31.250
-That's what shorting is, sir.

15:31.291 --> 15:34.041
If you own the stocks and the
price goes down, you're just
losing money.

15:36.083 --> 15:38.500
-That's what I said right?
That's what I did, right?

15:38.542 --> 15:40.750
When I said it to you?

15:40.792 --> 15:43.083
-I'm not 100% clear what's
being said right now.

15:43.125 --> 15:46.083
-I think I screwed this up,
I think he's right, I didn't
borrow anything.

15:46.125 --> 15:48.375
I've...they took my money out.
-Oooh.

15:48.417 --> 15:50.625
-How do I stop?
-[Simon]: Press escape?

15:50.667 --> 15:53.083
-Yeah, but I don't know the
password. The guy set it
up for me.

15:53.125 --> 15:56.375
The bank, I don't even...
-Banks...whoo.

15:56.417 --> 15:58.667
-I need a phone Simon,
this isn't funny.

15:58.709 --> 16:00.834
I'm losing all my money
right now.

16:00.875 --> 16:03.166
-Sir, if you want, you can
still apply for the butler job.

16:03.208 --> 16:06.000
-That's funny Alex.
-[Natalie]: Mr. Duncan?

16:06.041 --> 16:08.875
Just a reminder, there's a
student council meeting at
lunch.

16:08.917 --> 16:12.792
-Not now, Natalie. The least
of my worries is stupid student
council.

16:12.834 --> 16:15.250
-[Gerry types frantically]:
I don't know how to sell these.

16:15.291 --> 16:19.041

do this right now.

down and for that I would...

you with this plaque.

give me a plaque.

The sound of children outside,
being in the outside world.

16:49.333 --> 16:53.959
I mean, that's heaven to me.
Probably because I spent so much
time in a confined space.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.875
You know, I was surprised when I
got the job, initially.

16:57.917 --> 17:01.792
But when you sleep with
your parole officer he's
willing to pull a few strings.

17:01.834 --> 17:05.333
No background checks when
you're on your back, huh? Ha!

If I would have known there was
this much kindness out in the
world waiting for me

17:17.709 --> 17:21.250
maybe I wouldn't have knifed the
shift manager at the diner, what
an ass.

17:21.291 --> 17:23.750
[Mocking voice]: Wash your
hands! Wash your hands!

17:23.792 --> 17:29.250
I got his hands clean alright. I
stuck them in the deep fryer
before they pulled me off him.

17:29.291 --> 17:32.125
Yeah, how do you like
that for clean, jerk-off?

17:32.166 --> 17:35.208
So annoying!
I learned a lot in there.

17:35.250 --> 17:38.750
Mainly, that blood washes
off easier than gravy.

17:42.917 --> 17:45.208
Oh geez.

17:45.250 --> 17:49.250
I guess I got lost down memory
lane there for a second.

17:49.291 --> 17:51.417

-Hey, David? You owe me $6000.
-What?

18:01.333 --> 18:04.875
I did everything you told me to
do and I lost almost all my
pension.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.125
-I never told you to do
anything.

18:07.166 --> 18:09.208
-You told me to short a stock.

18:09.250 --> 18:12.250
I bought it or borrowed it,
whatever I was supposed to do.

18:12.291 --> 18:14.250
But I lost money,
that's all I know.

18:14.291 --> 18:16.542
-No. I said that's what I do.

18:16.583 --> 18:19.250
And I would certainly never
tell you to put your pension
on one stock.

18:19.291 --> 18:21.709

18:21.750 --> 18:24.542
-What's diversification? You
never mentioned that before.

18:24.583 --> 18:27.083
-And this is why I told
you to hire a professional.

18:27.125 --> 18:30.166
-You never mentioned
diversification David.

18:30.208 --> 18:34.834
You get me $6000. Why don't you
give me 3000? Half of it.

-You're gonna lend me
the money to buy the place?

20:08.875 --> 20:11.375
Better, took your advice Gerry,
decided to dive into the market.

20:11.417 --> 20:14.083

-And we can stay?

-You can stay.
-[Bill]: Yeah.

fancy strikes me. Oh,
might be pretty often.

20:18.875 --> 20:21.083
-Mmm.
Win, win, win.

20:21.125 --> 20:23.333
-Yeah.
-My mom wanted me to raise the
rent.

20:23.375 --> 20:27.166
But I said, no, they're my
friends. And I'll be staying
there a lot, so...

20:27.208 --> 20:30.166
So, she'll be swinging by,
occasionally herself for
sleepovers.

-I liked it better when we
owned it ourselves.

-We never owned the place,
Gerry.

20:34.417 --> 20:37.333
-Mmm, there's no proof of that.
-We're going to have to keep
