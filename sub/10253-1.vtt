WEBVTT

02:21.474 --> 02:24.748
Okay, a little more.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.460
You had some more space.

02:29.190 --> 02:31.213
How could you park like that?

02:31.359 --> 02:34.049
Its all right.
I'll be out in a jiffy anyway.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.718
This way.

03:35.090 --> 03:37.029
Sir, so is that your car?

03:58.780 --> 04:01.386
You bitch,
you're dead if I catch you.

04:01.491 --> 04:05.224
"The Chaser"

04:45.368 --> 04:46.807
Yes.

04:47.245 --> 04:49.018
Yes.

04:49.748 --> 04:51.312
I'm back!

04:52.751 --> 04:54.315
I'm sorry, sir.

04:56.963 --> 05:00.946
2 of our girls ran away.
Business has been bad lately.

05:01.259 --> 05:05.451
I've already put such a
big advance on those girls.

05:06.973 --> 05:12.165
But sir, I can't get that much
money ready in 3 days.

05:12.270 --> 05:16.337
Once I collect the money from them,
and pay you back...

05:22.864 --> 05:23.722
Turn it off, asshole!

05:23.740 --> 05:26.722
Can't you see I was on the phone?

05:29.579 --> 05:32.645
You have no fucking manners.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.479
Did you hand them out?

05:34.584 --> 05:36.857
- Yes, sir.
- Go hand out some more, idiot!

05:39.964 --> 05:42.655
Dumb asshole.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.831
Yes.

05:53.645 --> 05:55.209
Where?

05:55.772 --> 05:57.545
Hapjung district.

05:57.774 --> 06:01.340
Provence Motel, room 301.

06:01.861 --> 06:03.551
I'll send her now.

06:12.789 --> 06:14.645
- Hello.
- Hey.

06:14.874 --> 06:16.355
You came fast.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.449
Seong-hee, you don't look so young.

06:28.555 --> 06:31.328
- How old are you?
- 30.

06:31.641 --> 06:35.124
You took good care of yourself.
Nice body.

06:37.063 --> 06:39.044
Why? Need to go pee?

06:39.274 --> 06:41.045
- Yes.
- Later.

06:41.151 --> 06:44.258
- No.
- Go later.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.763
I told you to go later.

06:58.835 --> 07:00.940
- What's wrong?
- Let go.

07:01.046 --> 07:04.111
- Just wanted to take some pictures.
- Let go!

07:04.257 --> 07:06.446
Okay, I'll pay you instead.

07:06.551 --> 07:08.824
Let go, you pervert!

07:10.347 --> 07:11.451
What?

07:11.556 --> 07:13.746
Crazy assholes.

07:19.481 --> 07:20.836
Where is she?

07:23.568 --> 07:25.673
You fucking slut!

07:25.779 --> 07:28.968
You call me a pervert, huh?

07:29.074 --> 07:32.430
Watch your mouth, bitch!

07:32.535 --> 07:35.558
You want to die?

07:35.663 --> 07:37.769
Come here, you bitch!

07:37.874 --> 07:40.563
- Mister.
- You're dead!

07:40.669 --> 07:44.150
She's leaving. Calm down.

07:44.255 --> 07:46.444
- Get out!
- Come here, bitch!

07:46.549 --> 07:47.862
- Mister.
- Come over here!

07:47.967 --> 07:49.781
- She's leaving.
- Bitch...

07:49.886 --> 07:53.660
Come here, you bitch!
You're dead!

07:53.765 --> 07:56.287
- She's leaving now.
- You bitch!

07:56.393 --> 07:59.041
- Calm down...
- What the fuck...

08:01.398 --> 08:02.794
Who the hell are you?

08:02.899 --> 08:04.922
I'm her guardian, asshole.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.561
Sit down.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.730
Kneel down.

08:26.881 --> 08:29.071
Cover yourself!

08:48.069 --> 08:49.925
So what are you going to do?

08:52.282 --> 08:54.054
Let's settle this.

09:11.468 --> 09:13.032
Satisfied?

09:18.975 --> 09:21.748
There you are.

09:21.853 --> 09:23.334
Let me see.

09:25.982 --> 09:29.423
I'm quitting for real.
Don't call me.

09:30.987 --> 09:32.343
Hey!

09:34.074 --> 09:35.429
Hey!

09:39.996 --> 09:41.769
Did you find the girls?

09:45.251 --> 09:46.941
Where did you find the car?

09:47.253 --> 09:48.358
In Mangwon district.

09:48.463 --> 09:49.734
Did you call the police?

09:49.839 --> 09:51.152
You crazy?

09:51.257 --> 09:52.946
Report girls who
ran away from me?

09:53.051 --> 09:55.616
I told you they didn't run away.

09:56.054 --> 09:58.243
You used to be a detective.

09:58.348 --> 10:01.162
Then go find them
instead of ripping people off.

10:01.267 --> 10:04.041
You crazy bitch,
who says I'm ripping people off?

10:04.270 --> 10:07.044
I'm the one
who's being ripped off.

10:08.191 --> 10:11.089
Bitches get a big advance from me
and then disappear.

10:11.194 --> 10:13.843
Ask any asshole on the street
what it means.

10:14.072 --> 10:16.637
Whether they've been sold
or ran away.

10:19.869 --> 10:21.558
Rotten bastard.

10:21.663 --> 10:23.059
Hey!

10:23.164 --> 10:27.147
Hey! Seong-hee!

10:27.377 --> 10:30.526
That damn temper of hers.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.325
Meathead

10:40.056 --> 10:41.160
What?

10:41.266 --> 10:46.374
This bastard keeps rejecting the girls
and now there's no one left.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.169
There's Mi-Jin, idiot.

10:48.398 --> 10:50.545
She wants to rest
because she's caught a cold.

10:50.650 --> 10:54.008
Cold my ass. I'm hanging up.

10:54.571 --> 10:57.428
What the fuck's wrong
with everyone?

11:16.760 --> 11:18.115
Mom.

11:20.764 --> 11:22.661
Mom!

11:24.851 --> 11:25.894
What?

11:25.935 --> 11:27.416
Take the medicine.

11:50.460 --> 11:52.566
Bring me my cell phone, honey.

11:57.967 --> 11:59.740
Filth

12:13.066 --> 12:14.109
Yes, Jung-ho.

12:14.150 --> 12:15.756
Where are you?

12:15.985 --> 12:19.050
I'm sorry. I'm very sick.

12:19.155 --> 12:20.677
Where are you sick?

12:20.782 --> 12:22.930
I think it's a cold.
I also have a fever.

12:23.868 --> 12:25.765
I'll take a day off.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.058
A cold?

12:27.163 --> 12:29.270
In the middle of summer?

12:30.458 --> 12:31.814
Are you with a guy?

12:32.043 --> 12:33.356
No.

12:33.461 --> 12:35.734
Are you trying to run away
like the others?

12:35.839 --> 12:37.820
What are you saying?

12:38.174 --> 12:42.950
You better get to work
before you regret it.

12:43.847 --> 12:45.202
Okay?

12:46.057 --> 12:47.621
Why aren't you answering me?

12:48.351 --> 12:49.664
Jung-ho, please.

12:49.769 --> 12:53.460
Where do you live?
I'm going over right now.

12:55.358 --> 12:57.464
Where is it?

12:59.070 --> 13:01.092
Okay, I'll go.

13:01.197 --> 13:03.053
Call Meathead.

13:03.199 --> 13:04.555
Yes.

13:10.749 --> 13:12.313
Damn it.

13:15.170 --> 13:16.525
What's this?

13:25.055 --> 13:26.869
You have to go?

13:28.767 --> 13:30.831
I'll be back soon.

13:36.941 --> 13:38.631
Yes, a Matiz.

13:39.569 --> 13:43.511
I'm wearing a white cardigan
over a dress.

14:07.389 --> 14:08.660
Did it turn on?

14:08.765 --> 14:10.204
Yes.

14:21.277 --> 14:22.925
4885?

14:24.781 --> 14:26.345
4885...

14:28.076 --> 14:29.849
I've heard of it.

14:30.787 --> 14:32.350
4885?

14:32.455 --> 14:33.351
Know this number?

14:33.456 --> 14:34.769
Yes, sir.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.147
He's a complete wacko.

14:37.585 --> 14:40.359
Mi-Jin went to serve
that bastard.

14:40.463 --> 14:42.069
Ji-young

14:47.554 --> 14:49.535
Mi-Jin

14:50.265 --> 14:51.954
Shit.

14:55.270 --> 14:56.312
Where did she go?

14:56.354 --> 14:57.250
To Mangwon district.

14:57.355 --> 15:00.879
Yeah, it's that bastard.
He sold them.

15:00.984 --> 15:03.172
It's me.
Just answer yes or no.

15:03.278 --> 15:05.049
Are you with that bastard now?

15:05.155 --> 15:06.551
Your customer.

15:06.656 --> 15:08.553
At a motel or his home?

15:08.658 --> 15:10.889
Are you going to his house
in your car?

15:10.994 --> 15:12.265
Okay, listen carefully.

15:12.370 --> 15:15.184
Memorize his address
as you go into his house.

15:15.290 --> 15:17.645
Just do as I say.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.439
Don't get me upset.

15:19.544 --> 15:22.442
Soon as you go in,
tell him you'll take a shower.

15:22.547 --> 15:25.945
Then text me his address.
Simple, right?

15:26.051 --> 15:26.946
Don't let him be suspicious.

15:27.052 --> 15:29.617
You die if you screw up.

15:31.473 --> 15:32.744
I'm finally lucky.

15:32.849 --> 15:34.078
Shouldn't we report it?

15:34.184 --> 15:36.332
Want to see
this business go down?

15:36.561 --> 15:38.166
Look after the office.

15:38.271 --> 15:39.960
Yes, sir.

15:44.069 --> 15:45.673
Who is it?

15:45.779 --> 15:47.843
My manager.

15:48.490 --> 15:50.304
Your boss?

15:51.159 --> 15:53.224
Yes.

15:55.372 --> 15:56.935
Something wrong?

15:57.040 --> 16:00.231
No, he's worried that I'm sick.

16:01.169 --> 16:03.150
Which way shall I go?

16:03.380 --> 16:06.320
Over there.
Park in front of the guard post.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.840
What a tough life.

16:27.946 --> 16:30.343
The mayor of Seoul.

16:30.448 --> 16:33.138
At the market at this hour.

16:37.664 --> 16:38.707
Jung-ho, what's up?

16:38.748 --> 16:39.978
Gil-woo, are you busy?

16:40.083 --> 16:42.355
I'm busy, why?

16:42.460 --> 16:44.274
Remember what I told you?

16:44.379 --> 16:46.859
- What?
- About my girls running away.

16:46.965 --> 16:49.988
They didn't run away.
They've been sold.

16:50.093 --> 16:52.282
The same guy called for
the girls.

16:52.387 --> 16:54.993
So?
Going to catch that asshole?

16:55.098 --> 16:56.828
- Yes.
- Where are you?

16:56.933 --> 16:59.038
Mangwon district.
Are you busy now?

16:59.144 --> 17:02.041
I told you I'm busy.

17:02.147 --> 17:04.042
I don't know
how many of them there are.

17:04.148 --> 17:05.837
I might be outnumbered.

17:05.942 --> 17:08.256
Could you send
a few of your guys at least?

17:08.361 --> 17:10.634
History will be the judge!

17:11.281 --> 17:14.221
Get the hell out!

17:18.163 --> 17:20.184
Gil-woo?

17:20.290 --> 17:21.729
Damn it.

17:26.963 --> 17:28.444
It's here.

17:33.053 --> 17:34.742
Mangwon district, 24-1

17:54.783 --> 17:56.138
Something wrong?

17:56.785 --> 17:58.265
No.

18:05.168 --> 18:06.524
Come in.

18:07.462 --> 18:08.817
Okay.

18:49.170 --> 18:51.819
- Coming?
- Yes.

19:36.885 --> 19:38.741
I'll take a shower.

19:39.679 --> 19:42.036
Sure, it's over there.

19:59.449 --> 20:01.138
Mangwon district

20:03.578 --> 20:05.226
Sending

20:15.882 --> 20:17.321
Message failed

21:33.376 --> 21:36.942
I think I left the condom in my car.
I'll be right back.

21:40.050 --> 21:41.405
Okay.

22:12.374 --> 22:13.729
Mi-Jin

22:17.379 --> 22:19.984
Your call cannot be connected.

22:20.090 --> 22:21.737
Damn it.

22:23.259 --> 22:24.615
Mi-Jin

22:26.388 --> 22:28.577
- Your call cannot be connected.
- What the...

23:26.990 --> 23:28.762
Hey.

23:31.161 --> 23:32.641
Do you know Ji-young?

23:35.081 --> 23:37.229
Haven't seen her for a while,
have you?

23:40.253 --> 23:43.319
Hush, hush.

23:43.548 --> 23:46.030
She kept screaming,
so I cut off her tongue.

23:56.770 --> 23:58.542
Good.

24:00.273 --> 24:01.962
Mi-Jin.

24:02.567 --> 24:04.131
Scared?

24:06.196 --> 24:08.052
Do you want to go home?

24:11.368 --> 24:13.307
Why do you want to go home?

24:15.955 --> 24:18.312
Tell me why you should live.

24:21.753 --> 24:23.317
No reason?

24:24.172 --> 24:25.944
Spare me.

24:26.049 --> 24:27.863
Please let me live!

24:28.760 --> 24:30.448
No reason, right?

24:30.553 --> 24:33.452
Wait! I have one!

24:33.765 --> 24:35.829
I have a daughter.

24:36.976 --> 24:40.167
She's 7 years old.

24:45.068 --> 24:47.508
Nobody would even know
that you're dead.

24:48.947 --> 24:50.928
Nobody will look for you.

24:55.453 --> 24:57.726
Don't move.

24:57.872 --> 24:59.477
Don't move.

24:59.582 --> 25:02.147
It won't hurt at all.
None of them felt any pain.

25:03.461 --> 25:05.526
It hurts if you move around.

25:11.761 --> 25:13.450
Damn it.

25:15.890 --> 25:19.832
9256-4885

25:25.942 --> 25:27.840
Your call cannot be connected.

25:34.659 --> 25:36.849
Damn it.

26:25.960 --> 26:28.526
Damn it.

27:05.166 --> 27:06.814
Who is it?

27:07.544 --> 27:09.440
Sorry to disturb you so late.

27:09.546 --> 27:11.651
Is Mr. Park home?

27:11.756 --> 27:13.069
Who are you people?

27:13.174 --> 27:15.239
Please leave

27:15.760 --> 27:17.533
There's no one
by that name here.

27:18.763 --> 27:22.078
Mr. Park hasn't come
to church lately.

27:22.183 --> 27:24.164
There's no sign of him.

27:26.187 --> 27:28.169
There's no such person here.

27:29.566 --> 27:31.546
Then did he move?

27:31.651 --> 27:33.215
I don't know.

27:36.656 --> 27:39.221
Oh, goodness, it's Pungsan.

27:39.367 --> 27:41.264
- Honey, isn't that Pungsan?
- You're right.

27:41.369 --> 27:43.141
How'd you get so skinny?

27:43.246 --> 27:44.350
Let's go.

27:44.456 --> 27:45.977
Wait a minute. Look at her.

27:46.082 --> 27:48.022
Why are you being so stubborn?

27:48.752 --> 27:50.982
- Pungsan!
- I'm sorry to disturb you.

27:51.087 --> 27:53.444
Let's go.

27:54.466 --> 27:56.447
Something's not right.

27:56.593 --> 27:58.866
Wait a minute.

28:03.641 --> 28:05.331
Sorry.

28:05.769 --> 28:08.542
Actually, he's sleeping.

28:10.648 --> 28:12.213
Come inside.

28:14.652 --> 28:17.258
- Do you live around here?
- Yes.

28:17.364 --> 28:22.180
Have you seen a guy and a girl
with long hair and a pale face?

28:22.285 --> 28:23.181
No, I haven't.

28:23.286 --> 28:24.934
- They were just here.
- Sorry.

28:35.382 --> 28:38.531
Why do you keep on bothering me?

29:10.834 --> 29:12.523
Damn it.

29:28.184 --> 29:31.458
Fuck.

29:54.377 --> 29:55.847
I'm busy so just give me
your number.

29:55.879 --> 29:57.526
The insurance will cover it.

29:58.548 --> 30:02.239
I said just give me your number.

30:02.552 --> 30:03.949
Forget it. Just go.

30:04.054 --> 30:05.451
What?

30:06.056 --> 30:08.245
It's all right. Just leave.

30:10.185 --> 30:12.790
Don't lay one on me later.
Just give me your number.

30:12.896 --> 30:14.251
Mister!

30:15.190 --> 30:17.338
I'm all right, okay?

30:28.078 --> 30:29.934
Sir.

30:30.080 --> 30:32.977
I made a mistake,
so I should make up for it.

30:33.083 --> 30:34.522
It's okay.

30:35.752 --> 30:40.152
Give me your number.
I'll take care of it, okay?

30:40.965 --> 30:42.655
I said it's all right.

30:46.888 --> 30:49.577
I'm really okay,
so can you move your car?

30:49.683 --> 30:50.745
You don't have to pay me.

30:50.850 --> 30:54.208
No, give me your number.
I'll pay for the damage.

30:56.439 --> 30:58.254
You're hurt.

30:58.441 --> 31:00.339
Isn't that blood?

31:00.652 --> 31:02.424
What are you talking about?

31:07.575 --> 31:10.057
Move your car!

31:10.286 --> 31:14.060
I said move your car!
Are you deaf?

31:14.165 --> 31:17.272
Lady, move your damn car!

31:17.377 --> 31:18.941
Pull out!

31:19.170 --> 31:21.235
- Pull out!
- Hey, 4885.

31:23.758 --> 31:25.114
It's you, huh?

31:29.639 --> 31:32.246
Oh, brother.

31:32.767 --> 31:34.415
Son of a bitch.

31:42.152 --> 31:43.841
Answer it, asshole.

31:49.159 --> 31:53.267
You're dead meat.

31:55.373 --> 31:56.770
Get out.

32:20.357 --> 32:22.463
Hey! You!

32:23.777 --> 32:25.132
Hey!

32:30.450 --> 32:31.931
Son of a bitch.

32:37.248 --> 32:40.731
Stop, you son of a bitch!

32:49.552 --> 32:51.534
Wait till I catch you.

34:32.572 --> 34:34.136
Son of a bitch.

34:35.992 --> 34:37.848
Why are you running away?

34:38.995 --> 34:40.643
Think you'd get away?

34:45.043 --> 34:47.233
Asshole,
what did you do with my girls?

34:47.962 --> 34:49.818
You already sold them?

34:50.465 --> 34:53.112
Asshole, who the hell are you?

35:06.106 --> 35:07.377
Ji Young-min
Anyang city

35:07.482 --> 35:09.046
What the hell?

35:10.485 --> 35:13.551
Where's your house?

35:15.699 --> 35:16.761
Answer me.

35:16.866 --> 35:18.514
Answer me now.

35:19.035 --> 35:20.431
Anyang city.

35:20.537 --> 35:25.938
That's your address on paper.
Where do you live now?

35:26.251 --> 35:28.565
Not talking? You block me?

35:28.670 --> 35:30.526
You son of a bitch.

35:31.047 --> 35:33.445
You pain in the ass.

35:33.758 --> 35:35.947
- Move, now!
- Move your car back!

35:36.052 --> 35:37.950
Come here.

35:39.180 --> 35:40.660
Bastards.

35:40.765 --> 35:43.747
You caused this mess, asshole!

35:44.060 --> 35:45.457
Move.

35:45.979 --> 35:47.375
Out of the way.

35:47.480 --> 35:49.795
- Hey, Miss!
- What kind of person did do that...

35:51.067 --> 35:52.840
Move.
Out of the way.

35:53.737 --> 35:56.552
What are you doing?
Get out!

35:57.741 --> 36:00.055
Get in the car.

36:00.577 --> 36:02.849
If there's an accident,
you should go around.

36:02.954 --> 36:04.810
This won't solve anything.

36:05.457 --> 36:07.229
Move your car.

36:07.375 --> 36:09.856
Reverse!
Move back!

36:09.961 --> 36:11.317
Sir!

36:11.463 --> 36:13.027
Hey, you!

36:13.882 --> 36:16.362
You can't park like this.

36:16.468 --> 36:17.948
Is that your car?

36:18.261 --> 36:19.742
Yes.

36:23.850 --> 36:25.623
Are you a cop?

36:26.936 --> 36:28.333
Yes, I am.

36:28.438 --> 36:31.336
Show me your badge.

36:31.441 --> 36:35.216
I left it at the police station.

36:37.155 --> 36:38.843
This is 390.

36:38.948 --> 36:40.678
Come in Mangwon station.

36:40.784 --> 36:42.431
ID check.

36:43.286 --> 36:44.849
What station do you work at?

36:44.954 --> 36:47.560
I was in a task force unit
2 years ago.

36:47.665 --> 36:49.187
Let's call them.

36:49.292 --> 36:50.688
Let's go to the station first.

36:50.794 --> 36:53.191
But my girls are being sold
this very moment.

36:53.296 --> 36:56.070
Shut up! Let's go and talk!

36:56.383 --> 36:57.528
You son of a bitch.

36:57.634 --> 36:59.823
I told you to shut up!

37:07.143 --> 37:08.539
Damn it.

37:08.645 --> 37:10.334
No answer?

37:12.565 --> 37:16.381
No cell phone, either.
Nothing he says makes sense.

37:16.486 --> 37:19.260
All we need to do
is go to his house.

37:19.781 --> 37:22.178
Please write it all down,
frankly.

37:22.283 --> 37:23.471
Yes, sir.

37:23.576 --> 37:27.058
People like him need to be deported.
How dare you impersonate a cop!

37:27.163 --> 37:30.436
Asshole, tell the truth.
Where did you sell the girls?

37:30.542 --> 37:31.729
Be quiet!

37:31.835 --> 37:32.939
Why are you shouting?

37:33.044 --> 37:34.857
Ask that bastard directly.

37:34.963 --> 37:36.359
You're out of line.

37:36.464 --> 37:38.821
Ask him!
Don't just get on my case!

37:39.551 --> 37:41.031
You really sold them?

37:42.345 --> 37:43.449
Are you crazy?

37:43.555 --> 37:46.120
Sorry.
He just wanted me to ask.

37:46.349 --> 37:48.247
This is fucking insane.

37:49.352 --> 37:51.583
Block them, idiot!

37:51.688 --> 37:53.961
Be quiet!

37:54.482 --> 37:55.587
Which hospital?

37:55.692 --> 37:58.132
St. Mary's Hospital.
I'll call you from there.

37:58.570 --> 38:01.844
Why'd you throw shit on
his face, you crazy bastard?

38:03.742 --> 38:05.763
Yes, Captain.
I'm on my way now.

38:05.869 --> 38:08.434
How can I stop someone
who pops up out of nowhere?

38:08.663 --> 38:11.812
Hey, cover the seat first
before he gets in.

38:12.375 --> 38:14.315
Yes, the rest went to
the hospital.

38:14.753 --> 38:18.235
Yes, I'll bring him in first.

38:20.675 --> 38:23.657
Mr. Ji Young-min,
whose car is that?

38:23.970 --> 38:26.327
- Pardon? Car?
- Yes.

38:28.183 --> 38:30.039
It belongs to someone I know.

38:30.268 --> 38:31.789
Who is that person you know?

38:31.895 --> 38:33.250
What?

38:33.772 --> 38:35.460
What's his name?

38:35.565 --> 38:37.754
I can't remember.

38:37.859 --> 38:39.632
Do you know his number?

38:40.362 --> 38:42.218
It's at home.

38:47.952 --> 38:49.474
Something wrong?

38:49.579 --> 38:52.937
No, it's strange you don't know
the car owner.

38:54.876 --> 38:57.065
I have a very bad memory.

38:57.170 --> 38:59.652
Okay, just keep writing.

39:07.764 --> 39:10.536
Mr. Ji, does your number
start with 011 or 016?

39:10.642 --> 39:12.122
016

39:14.062 --> 39:16.210
I thought you didn't have a phone.

39:16.856 --> 39:18.169
What?

39:18.274 --> 39:20.130
Where's your cell phone?

39:20.777 --> 39:22.132
At home.

39:22.362 --> 39:24.051
Then why did you lie?

39:24.948 --> 39:26.637
Tell me your number.

39:28.660 --> 39:30.516
It's 4885, right?

39:30.662 --> 39:31.558
No.

39:31.663 --> 39:34.562
Come on, I can find out easily.

39:38.795 --> 39:40.191
Did you sell the girls?

39:40.296 --> 39:41.693
No.

39:41.798 --> 39:44.613
Come on, did you sell the girls?

39:45.051 --> 39:46.907
I said no.

39:47.637 --> 39:49.618
I didn't sell them.

39:50.473 --> 39:52.329
- I killed them...
- What?

39:52.559 --> 39:54.747
- Nothing.
- You just said something.

39:54.853 --> 39:57.251
- What?
- You said that you killed them.

39:59.649 --> 40:01.170
Yes.

40:01.276 --> 40:02.756
What?

40:03.778 --> 40:06.427
Yes, I killed them.

40:15.999 --> 40:17.228
Whose shit is it?
Is it yours?

40:17.334 --> 40:19.564
History will be the judge of things!
Damn you all!

40:19.669 --> 40:22.735
- Crazy asshole.
- What a crazy...

40:23.048 --> 40:25.361
We're in deep trouble for this.

40:25.467 --> 40:26.946
This is crazy.

40:27.052 --> 40:28.448
I've been suffering.

40:28.553 --> 40:31.159
They've stopped the water supply
and I haven't washed for ages.

40:31.264 --> 40:33.161
Jung-ho I can't even
flush my own shit.

40:33.266 --> 40:35.539
Shut the hell up!

40:35.852 --> 40:37.333
Be quiet.

40:40.065 --> 40:41.545
What?

40:41.691 --> 40:43.255
I'm busy now.

40:43.360 --> 40:46.967
What are you talking about?

40:47.072 --> 40:49.677
How do you know
whether he killed them or not?

40:49.783 --> 40:51.305
Anyway...

40:51.534 --> 40:52.932
Yes.

40:53.244 --> 40:54.725
9 of them?

40:56.247 --> 40:58.103
He said he killed 9 people?

40:58.541 --> 41:01.023
Hey, Jung-ho.

41:01.544 --> 41:03.526
Bastard.

41:06.257 --> 41:08.447
That Son of...

41:11.763 --> 41:12.659
Detective Oh.

41:12.764 --> 41:14.119
Yes?

41:15.058 --> 41:16.871
Remember the Mapo murder case?

41:16.976 --> 41:20.083
- 3 murdered women?
- Yeah.

41:20.188 --> 41:22.669
How many occurred
in Mangwon district?

41:22.774 --> 41:24.713
All of them happened in Mangwon.

41:24.859 --> 41:26.215
In the ally at dawn.

41:26.861 --> 41:28.217
Really?

41:29.864 --> 41:31.220
Why?

41:32.450 --> 41:33.931
Never mind.

41:39.958 --> 41:41.522
What shall we do?

41:42.252 --> 41:43.648
Let's take him in first.

41:43.753 --> 41:45.734
His statement makes sense.

41:46.256 --> 41:47.298
It does, doesn't it?

41:47.382 --> 41:49.571
Bunch of idiots wasting time.

41:49.676 --> 41:52.282
What did you say?

41:52.387 --> 41:53.575
You're way out of line.

41:53.680 --> 41:54.576
Watch what you say.

41:54.681 --> 41:56.828
He's pretending to be crazy now.

41:56.933 --> 41:58.162
Hey!

41:58.268 --> 41:59.956
Shut up, you pimp.

42:00.061 --> 42:02.667
You're worse than this asshole.

42:02.772 --> 42:06.254
You sell out your old police badge
to pimp girls.

42:06.359 --> 42:07.255
Take him to the car.

42:07.360 --> 42:08.965
- Yes?
- Put him in the car!

42:09.070 --> 42:09.966
Yes, sir!

42:10.071 --> 42:13.637
We're not taking the blame
for him beating this guy up.

42:14.576 --> 42:16.055
Let's not be like this, okay?

42:16.161 --> 42:19.018
Let's go.
Hurry up.

42:20.874 --> 42:21.724
Hello.

42:21.791 --> 42:22.979
Gil-woo!

42:23.084 --> 42:24.272
Where are you going?

42:24.377 --> 42:25.356
Those idiots are holding him.

42:25.462 --> 42:27.067
- And just...
- Hold on.

42:27.797 --> 42:29.445
Can I help you?

42:30.050 --> 42:31.822
I'm from the Task Force Unit.

42:32.052 --> 42:33.156
Where?

42:33.261 --> 42:35.033
The Task Force Unit
at the Seoul station.

42:35.138 --> 42:36.868
You must've come
for the Mapo case files.

42:36.973 --> 42:39.914
No, I came for that guy.

42:40.143 --> 42:41.186
What?

42:41.269 --> 42:42.750
I'm taking him in.

43:00.080 --> 43:01.852
Sorry to wake you up, sir.

43:02.874 --> 43:03.645
What is this all about?

43:03.750 --> 43:05.855
It's a bit complicated.

43:05.960 --> 43:07.440
Damn it!

43:07.545 --> 43:09.026
Who is this?

43:09.172 --> 43:10.652
Yes, this man is...

43:10.757 --> 43:12.070
Is he the shit thrower?

43:12.175 --> 43:13.571
Yes, I believe so.

43:13.677 --> 43:16.449
Crazy bastard,
why'd you throw shit at someone?

43:16.554 --> 43:18.576
What is he saying?

43:18.682 --> 43:22.580
Looks like he has to urinate.
Would you like to talk to him?

43:22.686 --> 43:24.250
Forget it.

43:24.854 --> 43:26.251
So are you sure about this?

43:26.356 --> 43:27.460
Yes, Gil-woo is.

43:27.565 --> 43:29.671
Don't use him as an excuse.

43:29.776 --> 43:32.173
- Sorry, sir.
- Okay.

43:32.278 --> 43:33.634
You son of bitch!

43:34.864 --> 43:36.470
Why is it so noisy in here!

43:38.368 --> 43:40.015
Sir!

43:40.370 --> 43:43.143
Crazy bastards.

43:43.665 --> 43:45.229
Who's Ji Young-min?

43:48.878 --> 43:50.651
Are you Ji Young-min?

43:51.172 --> 43:52.443
Yes.

43:52.549 --> 43:54.238
What happened to your face?

43:57.178 --> 43:59.951
Are you all out of your minds?

44:00.056 --> 44:02.954
Sir, we didn't do anything.

44:03.059 --> 44:04.748
Shut up!

44:06.688 --> 44:08.335
Come outside.

44:08.773 --> 44:10.629
Come out now!

44:16.573 --> 44:20.139
- Have a good life.
- Let me loose.

44:20.869 --> 44:22.641
Who beat him?

44:22.746 --> 44:25.060
- Well...
- They did it?

44:25.665 --> 44:27.562
- I don't know, sir.
- Find out who beat him

44:27.667 --> 44:30.148
and then bring him in.

44:30.253 --> 44:31.482
Yes, sir!

44:31.588 --> 44:33.425
- You know the situation we're in?
- Yes, sir.

44:33.465 --> 44:35.069
We're all dead if this case fails.

44:35.175 --> 44:36.530
Yes, sir.

44:41.264 --> 44:42.785
Who did this to you?

44:42.891 --> 44:44.245
That guy inside.

44:44.351 --> 44:45.830
- Who?
- Hey!

44:45.935 --> 44:49.043
There's more than one in there!

44:49.147 --> 44:50.251
That man over there.

44:50.357 --> 44:52.337
Come here, you son of a bitch.

44:52.442 --> 44:55.048
You lie to all of them?

44:55.153 --> 44:56.003
You son of a bitch!

44:56.071 --> 44:58.176
- Chill.
- That little...!

44:58.281 --> 45:00.178
Cut it out.
Let's go to the station first.

45:00.283 --> 45:02.472
Jung-ho, you can do it there.

45:02.577 --> 45:05.058
Right, let's go.

45:05.163 --> 45:07.228
Gil-woo, come here.

45:07.457 --> 45:09.647
Let's go and do it, okay?

45:10.377 --> 45:12.065
You're sure about this, right?

45:12.170 --> 45:13.213
Yes, I'm sure.

45:13.296 --> 45:14.859
- Absolutely sure?
- Yes, I am.

45:14.964 --> 45:16.737
Okay, let's go.

45:19.552 --> 45:21.116
- Let's go.
- Okay.

45:21.554 --> 45:23.159
- Wait! Stop!
- Why?

45:23.264 --> 45:24.244
Where'd that bastard go?

45:24.265 --> 45:26.037
- Who?
- Jung-ho.

45:26.142 --> 45:27.748
Damn it.

45:32.982 --> 45:34.170
There's that bastard.

45:34.275 --> 45:36.047
Hey!

45:36.152 --> 45:37.382
Come to the office!

45:37.487 --> 45:39.467
- Okay.
- You better come!

45:39.572 --> 45:41.136
Okay!

46:08.852 --> 46:10.332
Owner: Kwon Hae-gab

46:11.354 --> 46:13.335
Damn bastard.

46:48.767 --> 46:50.456
Hey.

46:51.061 --> 46:52.750
Hey!

46:54.689 --> 46:56.628
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

46:56.733 --> 46:58.422
What did you kill the girls with?

46:59.444 --> 47:01.133
With a chisel.

47:01.237 --> 47:03.134
The ones to crack stones?

47:03.239 --> 47:04.552
Yes.

47:04.657 --> 47:06.346
- Is that right?
- Yes,

47:06.451 --> 47:08.224
it was a narrow
blunt instrument.

47:09.662 --> 47:11.435
Okay.

47:11.664 --> 47:15.271
I need to pee really bad.
Let me out.

47:15.377 --> 47:17.357
Shut up.

47:17.462 --> 47:20.653
Or else I'll yank your dick out.

47:21.091 --> 47:22.278
Detective.

47:22.384 --> 47:24.031
What?

47:24.886 --> 47:27.743
Kim Mi-Jin is probably still alive.

47:28.390 --> 47:29.827
What's he talking about?

47:29.933 --> 47:31.622
Kim Mi-Jin.

47:31.935 --> 47:34.040
The girl that guy was looking for.

47:34.145 --> 47:35.458
Where is she now?

47:35.563 --> 47:37.211
In Anyang city?

47:38.441 --> 47:40.047
Why?

47:41.444 --> 47:44.635
Why would the victim be there?

47:45.949 --> 47:48.471
Wait, stop the car.

47:48.576 --> 47:52.351
That's just his address on paper.
He lives in Mangwon district.

47:52.455 --> 47:55.062
That's where I caught him.

47:56.668 --> 47:59.733
Bastard hangs up the phone
before I'm finished.

48:02.882 --> 48:04.238
Car registration

48:27.782 --> 48:29.430
Who is it?

48:31.494 --> 48:32.933
Do you know this man?

48:34.289 --> 48:35.644
No.

48:35.874 --> 48:37.562
These keys?

48:37.667 --> 48:39.063
I don't know.

48:39.169 --> 48:40.732
Look carefully.

48:40.837 --> 48:42.735
It's the first time I've seen it.

48:45.759 --> 48:47.572
Where did they go?

48:47.677 --> 48:51.327
They were going to some meeting,
but I don't remember.

48:51.973 --> 48:53.161
<i>Yanpyung 11 a.m.</i>
Yangpyung?

48:53.266 --> 48:55.623
Yes, I think so.

48:57.687 --> 48:59.126
Yangpyung is...

48:59.856 --> 49:03.756
Anyway, they must've past
the corner store.

49:10.033 --> 49:12.347
What took you so long, idiot?

49:12.452 --> 49:14.225
What happened?

49:14.537 --> 49:15.850
What about Mi-Jin?

49:15.955 --> 49:17.143
I couldn't find her.

49:17.248 --> 49:18.645
What?

49:18.750 --> 49:20.438
See that store
across the street?

49:20.543 --> 49:22.649
- Yes.
- See that alley next to it?

49:22.754 --> 49:24.818
- Yes.
- So,

49:24.964 --> 49:28.447
Search every house from there
to this address with this.

49:30.970 --> 49:32.450
- What is this?
- Find houses

49:32.555 --> 49:36.871
with basements,
where the cell phone wouldn't work.

49:36.976 --> 49:38.958
Where is this house?

49:40.063 --> 49:41.544
Come here.

49:43.858 --> 49:46.340
- See that top over there?
- Yes.

49:47.070 --> 49:48.758
Where the hell
are you looking, idiot?

49:48.863 --> 49:50.969
That top over the cross.

49:51.074 --> 49:52.554
Yes.

49:52.659 --> 49:54.223
Right there.

49:56.162 --> 49:58.435
Why don't we just report it?

49:58.665 --> 49:59.561
They know already.

49:59.666 --> 50:01.646
Then why go through the trouble?

50:01.751 --> 50:03.565
Just do what I say, asshole.

50:03.670 --> 50:05.651
We have to find Mi-Jin.

50:06.756 --> 50:08.362
I got it.

50:10.593 --> 50:11.489
Search every corner!

50:11.594 --> 50:12.950
Okay!

50:21.563 --> 50:23.711
Shit.

50:33.158 --> 50:35.847
If you make an arrest
without a warrant,

50:35.952 --> 50:38.642
you need approval by
a prosecutor within 12 hours.

50:39.289 --> 50:40.685
12 hours?

50:40.790 --> 50:42.354
Yes.

50:44.794 --> 50:46.567
What if it isn't approved?

50:47.464 --> 50:48.861
We have to release him.

50:49.591 --> 50:50.862
Shit.

50:50.967 --> 50:52.155
Where are you?

50:52.260 --> 50:55.326
It's already 2.
What have you been doing?

50:56.639 --> 51:00.247
Why'd you go to Mangwon
after Anyang city?

51:00.560 --> 51:04.251
Then you should've dropped off
the shit thrower.

51:27.837 --> 51:29.527
Sit down.

51:33.176 --> 51:36.366
So did you hit them with a chisel
or hammer them with it?

51:36.471 --> 51:38.536
Used the hammer, of course.

51:38.765 --> 51:40.246
Give me your hand.

51:41.559 --> 51:43.249
Relax.

51:44.562 --> 51:45.458
Why'd you kill them like that?

51:45.563 --> 51:48.754
I choked them and used knives,
but they were too painful.

51:52.862 --> 51:55.261
I saw how pigs were killed
and did the same.

51:56.199 --> 51:57.428
And then?

51:57.534 --> 51:59.430
- Hang them on the wall.
- What?

51:59.536 --> 52:00.578
Yes?

52:00.662 --> 52:01.558
Hang what?

52:01.663 --> 52:03.268
Their bodies, of course.

52:03.373 --> 52:04.812
Say ah.

52:08.962 --> 52:10.526
And then?

52:11.172 --> 52:13.069
You know that muscle
behind the ankles?

52:13.174 --> 52:14.571
- The Achilles tendon?
- Yes.

52:14.676 --> 52:16.573
I slice it with a knife.

52:16.678 --> 52:18.866
- Of the dead body?
- Yes.

52:18.972 --> 52:20.285
Why?

52:20.390 --> 52:23.455
To drain out the blood.
Otherwise they're too heavy to lift.

52:24.561 --> 52:25.958
That's right.

52:26.396 --> 52:28.460
That's how
the corpses get lighter.

52:28.982 --> 52:30.461
So what did you do next?

52:30.567 --> 52:35.133
Leave it around for a day,
drain out all the blood and mess.

52:35.238 --> 52:37.552
Then I ax the bodies
and bury them.

52:37.657 --> 52:38.845
Where?

52:38.950 --> 52:40.263
Yes?

52:40.368 --> 52:42.433
Where'd you bury
the dead bodies?

52:44.080 --> 52:46.020
Here and there.

52:47.959 --> 52:50.148
Here and there is where?
Tell me exactly.

52:50.253 --> 52:51.942
Well...

52:52.672 --> 52:55.570
You wouldn't have buried
9 people in your front yard.

52:55.675 --> 52:57.531
Not 9.

52:57.677 --> 52:58.781
What?

52:58.887 --> 53:00.242
It's 12.

53:02.766 --> 53:05.206
Why 12? Wasn't it 9?

53:06.061 --> 53:08.666
Come to think of it, it was 12.

53:08.772 --> 53:10.168
Are you kidding me?

53:10.273 --> 53:11.629
Gil-woo!

53:15.070 --> 53:19.344
Just tell us what you remember.

53:19.449 --> 53:21.639
You're doing well.

53:22.452 --> 53:25.266
I was driving and
the Equus popped out.

53:25.372 --> 53:27.937
It slammed into my car,
and this rat was driving.

53:28.291 --> 53:29.562
That's why you beat him?

53:29.668 --> 53:32.857
No, I held on to him
and called 4885.

53:32.962 --> 53:34.735
- And his phone is...
- Hey.

53:35.173 --> 53:38.030
Just answer what I ask you.

53:38.468 --> 53:40.616
So you beat him, right?

53:41.471 --> 53:43.911
It was you
who messed up his face, right?

53:46.351 --> 53:47.706
What are you doing?

53:51.564 --> 53:53.838
Yes? Now?

53:54.776 --> 53:56.340
Yes, sir.

53:58.780 --> 54:00.845
The chief wants to see you.

54:01.157 --> 54:04.139
Testimony
First, press your finger.

54:17.048 --> 54:18.737
Go to Mi-jin's house?

54:19.342 --> 54:22.241
Yes, go with him.

54:23.680 --> 54:25.243
- Why?
- To do a DNA test

54:25.348 --> 54:27.245
on the blood
on his shirt and her samples.

54:27.350 --> 54:30.164
So you actually believe
what this bastard's saying?

54:30.270 --> 54:31.374
Hey! Just go!

54:31.479 --> 54:35.169
I doubt this bastard killed anyone.
Just search the neighborhood.

54:35.275 --> 54:36.755
Hey! Jung-ho!

54:37.068 --> 54:39.758
Give me a break.

54:41.865 --> 54:44.137
Does it taste delicious,
you bastard!

54:44.242 --> 54:45.930
Why do you keep hitting him?

54:46.036 --> 54:48.141
Is this time to eat chocolate?

54:48.246 --> 54:49.935
Hey! Jung-ho!

54:54.669 --> 54:57.651
Bastard.

55:01.384 --> 55:03.221
Is it true that the suspect
threw human feces?

55:03.261 --> 55:05.743
Have you identified the suspect?

55:08.475 --> 55:09.955
Almost there.

55:10.560 --> 55:13.751
Turn right and go straight?

55:16.733 --> 55:18.214
Straight in?

55:19.944 --> 55:21.300
Steps?

55:21.863 --> 55:24.220
Downstairs?

55:29.954 --> 55:31.435
The first one?

55:32.957 --> 55:34.313
Okay.

55:35.877 --> 55:38.066
Anybody home?
Anybody there?

55:38.171 --> 55:40.444
Of course nobody's here.

55:42.384 --> 55:44.365
What shall we do now?

55:44.886 --> 55:46.111
Let's go to the owner's house.

55:46.179 --> 55:48.369
Move, move.

55:54.437 --> 55:56.043
What is that?

55:56.439 --> 55:57.752
You scared me.

55:57.857 --> 55:59.671
You should've answered
if you were inside.

55:59.776 --> 56:01.965
- Is this the police?
- Hey, you!

56:02.070 --> 56:03.550
Strangers are breaking in.

56:03.655 --> 56:06.428
Mapo-gu Sangsoo-dong 21-15.

56:06.950 --> 56:08.846
They're coming inside!

56:08.952 --> 56:10.349
Give it to me.

56:11.663 --> 56:16.146
Who the hell are you?

56:17.460 --> 56:18.941
I'm asking you.

56:26.469 --> 56:28.033
Are you Mi-jin's daughter?

56:34.853 --> 56:38.251
This place is a mess.

56:38.356 --> 56:40.337
What are you doing here?

56:40.775 --> 56:42.380
Go stay over there.

56:42.485 --> 56:44.425
Why are you
taking someone's hair?

56:44.779 --> 56:47.136
You little prick, go away.

56:47.490 --> 56:49.554
Why are you taking her hair?

56:49.659 --> 56:52.557
Aren't you going to sleep?

56:52.662 --> 56:54.643
You go to sleep.

56:55.582 --> 56:58.563
You're just like your mom.

56:58.668 --> 57:00.064
What about my mom?

57:00.170 --> 57:01.817
You little brat.

57:02.047 --> 57:04.403
All done. So what now?

57:04.966 --> 57:07.740
Leave, of course.

57:14.267 --> 57:15.956
What's your name?

57:19.189 --> 57:20.544
Take it.

57:21.858 --> 57:23.964
Call me
if you get into any trouble.

57:26.071 --> 57:27.426
Let's go.

57:42.754 --> 57:44.610
Damn it.

57:46.341 --> 57:51.241
According to witnesses,

57:51.346 --> 57:54.745
Bastard made me
lose my appetite.

57:55.558 --> 57:57.331
Where's my mom?

57:58.269 --> 57:59.874
She's working.

57:59.979 --> 58:02.044
Then why'd you take her hair?

58:02.357 --> 58:04.505
For a DNA test?

58:06.945 --> 58:08.258
You're unbelievable.

58:08.363 --> 58:10.636
My mom isn't working now,
is she?

58:12.659 --> 58:14.223
Something happened to her?

58:15.870 --> 58:20.229
Don't you have somewhere to go?

58:23.461 --> 58:25.234
How much did you search?

58:26.673 --> 58:30.239
I'll be there soon,
so search around some more.

58:30.385 --> 58:35.452
Also, do you know anyone
who can look after a kid?

58:38.143 --> 58:39.623
Okay, bye.

58:48.945 --> 58:51.551
Look behind you!

58:51.656 --> 58:53.344
Is there a cigarette?

58:53.450 --> 58:54.345
Yes.

58:54.451 --> 58:56.764
Get back there.

58:56.870 --> 59:00.060
Throw it out the window.

59:00.874 --> 59:02.186
Is it gone?

59:02.292 --> 59:03.856
Yes.

59:04.461 --> 59:06.274
Is there a burned mark?

59:06.379 --> 59:08.235
Yes.

59:09.090 --> 59:11.529
Damn it, nothing's helping me.

59:11.634 --> 59:13.531
What a day.

59:13.636 --> 59:16.410
You called my mom before, right?

59:17.057 --> 59:20.038
Didn't you ask my mom
to go to work tonight?

59:20.143 --> 59:23.042
I'll send you back home
if you keep bothering me.

59:23.772 --> 59:25.043
Filth.

59:25.148 --> 59:27.337
What did you say?

59:27.442 --> 59:29.423
What? Filth?

59:33.656 --> 59:35.554
Get out!

59:36.576 --> 59:39.433
The Mapo murders
are also included.

59:39.788 --> 59:41.768
But who's this woman
that's alive?

59:41.873 --> 59:45.230
He seems to be lying.
She's probably been murdered.

59:45.335 --> 59:47.440
Except for the Mapo murders,

59:47.545 --> 59:50.068
they were killed at his house
and you can't find the bodies?

59:50.173 --> 59:51.069
No, sir.

59:51.174 --> 59:52.425
If you don't know the address,

59:52.467 --> 59:54.364
it means
you don't know anything.

59:54.469 --> 59:57.158
The suspect can't remember
the address,

59:57.263 --> 01:00:00.746
but we can find it quickly
if we start searching in the morning.

01:00:00.975 --> 01:00:04.165
Why aren't his motives
written down?

01:00:04.270 --> 01:00:07.460
He kept on talking gibberish.
No particular motivation.

01:00:07.565 --> 01:00:10.755
Then make one up!
What the hell is this?

01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:12.758
Yes, sir.

01:00:14.489 --> 01:00:15.552
You know the situation we're in?

01:00:15.657 --> 01:00:16.719
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

01:00:16.825 --> 01:00:18.931
We die if we blow this.

01:00:19.035 --> 01:00:22.058
Get this right
if you want to keep your jobs.

01:00:22.163 --> 01:00:24.561
So that the mayor's incident
shuts up, okay?

01:00:24.666 --> 01:00:26.021
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

01:00:28.962 --> 01:00:30.005
Who is it?

01:00:30.046 --> 01:00:33.153
The police. Open the door.

01:00:34.759 --> 01:00:38.658
Sit down.

01:00:38.763 --> 01:00:39.659
Sit comfortably.

01:00:39.764 --> 01:00:41.328
Yes.

01:00:42.183 --> 01:00:43.539
Lady.

01:00:43.685 --> 01:00:46.457
How can a sister
not know where her brother lives?

01:00:46.563 --> 01:00:48.836
We really don't know.

01:00:49.065 --> 01:00:51.754
We haven't seen him
for a long time.

01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:53.632
How long?

01:00:54.070 --> 01:00:56.843
About 3 years.

01:00:56.948 --> 01:00:58.637
Where did he live then?

01:00:59.367 --> 01:01:01.140
In prison, right?

01:01:01.870 --> 01:01:03.558
Yes, in prison.

01:01:03.663 --> 01:01:05.853
What a screwed-up family.

01:01:06.249 --> 01:01:08.271
Now let's put things
in order, yes?

01:01:08.376 --> 01:01:09.981
Like I said before,

01:01:10.086 --> 01:01:15.445
your brother and brother-in-law
sold 3 of my girls.

01:01:15.550 --> 01:01:18.656
But I've paid twenty thousand
for those girls.

01:01:18.762 --> 01:01:20.659
What shall we do about that?

01:01:29.064 --> 01:01:31.045
Let's sign a contract.

01:01:32.067 --> 01:01:33.923
Why aren't you answering?

01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:43.640
Byeong-soo!

01:01:43.745 --> 01:01:46.352
Are you all right?

01:01:46.664 --> 01:01:48.646
Everything's okay.

01:01:52.462 --> 01:01:55.236
He was like this
ever since he was a baby.

01:01:55.882 --> 01:02:00.324
My son was bleeding
when I came back home.

01:02:00.929 --> 01:02:03.534
My damn brother
was the only one home.

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:07.540
Ever since then,
I barely saw my brother.

01:02:10.271 --> 01:02:12.336
Where are we going?

01:02:13.566 --> 01:02:15.548
I said where are we going?

01:02:16.861 --> 01:02:19.343
We're not looking for my mom,
are we?

01:02:19.572 --> 01:02:21.929
Be quiet!

01:02:22.659 --> 01:02:24.932
Let me think.

01:02:33.753 --> 01:02:35.858
Is your name Oh Eun-shil?

01:02:35.964 --> 01:02:37.319
Why?

01:02:37.465 --> 01:02:40.154
Your eyes are very pretty.

01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:42.324
Shut up.

01:02:56.151 --> 01:02:57.547
Why'd you cut your hair
so short?

01:02:57.652 --> 01:03:00.050
You'd look sexy with long hair.

01:03:00.488 --> 01:03:02.845
- Hey!
- Yes?

01:03:02.991 --> 01:03:05.431
- You want a beating?
- No.

01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:17.234
Just sit and don't screw around.

01:03:25.388 --> 01:03:27.536
You're not wearing any perfume.

01:03:28.058 --> 01:03:31.332
You must be on your period.
Smells fishy.

01:03:55.168 --> 01:03:56.941
Is this a call-girl massage parlor?

01:03:57.045 --> 01:03:58.442
Let me ask you something.

01:04:03.885 --> 01:04:05.241
What's up?

01:04:07.389 --> 01:04:09.661
We're in deep trouble.

01:04:09.766 --> 01:04:12.747
That asshole has done this
twice before.

01:04:12.852 --> 01:04:14.249
What are you talking about?

01:04:14.354 --> 01:04:16.334
The prosecutor called.

01:04:16.439 --> 01:04:19.254
Young-min said he killed
someone before.

01:04:19.359 --> 01:04:21.631
But he was freed since
there wasn't enough evidence.

01:04:21.736 --> 01:04:24.842
The prosecutor ordered him
to be freed.

01:04:24.948 --> 01:04:27.845
The chief is going to
have a fit.

01:04:27.951 --> 01:04:30.349
We're screwed.

01:04:32.163 --> 01:04:34.019
You want to die?

01:04:35.959 --> 01:04:37.940
Did you kill them or not?

01:04:39.587 --> 01:04:40.858
Answer me, you bastard!

01:04:40.964 --> 01:04:43.528
Young-min,
you told us everything before.

01:04:43.633 --> 01:04:45.363
What's wrong with you?

01:04:45.468 --> 01:04:47.241
Turn the camera.

01:04:49.848 --> 01:04:51.412
Let me ask you once more.

01:04:51.933 --> 01:04:53.747
Did you kill them or not?

01:04:55.145 --> 01:04:56.834
I'm sorry.

01:04:59.482 --> 01:05:01.254
Who the hell
do you think you are?

01:05:01.359 --> 01:05:03.841
You must think
we're some damn clowns.

01:05:09.492 --> 01:05:10.346
I checked.

01:05:10.452 --> 01:05:13.266
Noryangjin station's warrant
was rejected by the judge.

01:05:13.371 --> 01:05:14.976
Eunpyung station was like us.

01:05:15.081 --> 01:05:16.477
Both stations
had insufficient evidence.

01:05:16.583 --> 01:05:20.024
Screw them.
That asshole is the murderer.

01:05:20.337 --> 01:05:22.734
He can't make that kind of statement
if he hadn't killed them.

01:05:22.839 --> 01:05:24.444
That's right.

01:05:24.549 --> 01:05:26.906
So do you want to let him go?

01:05:28.053 --> 01:05:32.328
Or search that neighborhood
to find some evidence?

01:05:32.682 --> 01:05:33.745
Listen carefully.

01:05:33.850 --> 01:05:35.872
He said he buried the victims,

01:05:35.977 --> 01:05:37.957
- Right?
- Yes, sir.

01:05:38.063 --> 01:05:40.460
It means he buried
the victims somewhere else.

01:05:40.565 --> 01:05:43.547
He couldn't have buried
all 12 bodies in his front yard.

01:05:43.777 --> 01:05:45.465
- In the mountain!
- Yes,

01:05:45.570 --> 01:05:47.426
but are there
many mountains there?

01:05:47.781 --> 01:05:48.676
No, sir.

01:05:48.782 --> 01:05:51.721
No, there is only one.
Sungmi Mountain.

01:05:51.826 --> 01:05:53.723
- Am I right?
- Yes, sir.

01:05:53.828 --> 01:05:55.433
Go search there.

01:05:55.538 --> 01:05:58.312
Find the dead bodies.

01:06:18.561 --> 01:06:20.167
Are you really a cop?

01:06:22.273 --> 01:06:24.421
Show me your badge.

01:06:24.526 --> 01:06:26.715
I can't believe this.

01:06:27.862 --> 01:06:29.634
You're not a cop, are you?

01:06:29.739 --> 01:06:32.971
Fuck.

01:06:33.076 --> 01:06:34.640
Fuck?

01:06:35.161 --> 01:06:39.228
Get lost.

01:06:51.678 --> 01:06:56.245
Repeat this number,
016-9265-4885.

01:06:57.767 --> 01:06:59.747
9265-4885...

01:06:59.853 --> 01:07:01.333
Find it.

01:07:05.358 --> 01:07:07.047
See if anyone's coming!

01:07:13.283 --> 01:07:14.722
Here.

01:07:17.078 --> 01:07:17.974
Hyun-ju

01:07:18.079 --> 01:07:19.267
Where is she?

01:07:19.372 --> 01:07:20.853
Not here.

01:07:21.791 --> 01:07:23.187
She disappeared on this day?

01:07:23.293 --> 01:07:24.689
Don't know.

01:07:24.794 --> 01:07:26.858
Not knowing doesn't resolve things,
you bastard.

01:07:26.963 --> 01:07:28.569
You didn't even look for her?

01:07:41.561 --> 01:07:43.042
Where's your dad?

01:07:43.355 --> 01:07:44.876
He's in Brazil

01:07:44.981 --> 01:07:46.337
Brazil?

01:07:48.651 --> 01:07:50.048
Where in Brazil?

01:07:50.153 --> 01:07:51.758
Rio de Janeiro.

01:07:51.863 --> 01:07:53.427
What?

01:07:53.656 --> 01:07:55.971
The old capital of Brazil.

01:07:57.577 --> 01:07:58.890
What's he doing there?

01:07:58.995 --> 01:08:00.935
Working.

01:08:05.752 --> 01:08:07.441
Have you seen your dad?

01:08:07.671 --> 01:08:09.026
No.

01:08:10.048 --> 01:08:12.238
Did you talk on
the phone with him?

01:08:16.179 --> 01:08:18.536
Damn.

01:08:20.850 --> 01:08:22.455
What a bitch.

01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:24.750
Better off saying Saudi Arabia.

01:08:29.984 --> 01:08:32.258
Eat up.

01:08:34.279 --> 01:08:36.345
What a damn temper.

01:08:54.551 --> 01:08:56.365
Are you okay?

01:08:56.678 --> 01:08:57.720
Yes.

01:08:57.761 --> 01:09:01.245
Damn it.

01:09:02.975 --> 01:09:04.747
Shit!

01:09:27.751 --> 01:09:32.026
I've found it.

01:09:33.173 --> 01:09:35.362
- Where?
- Right here.

01:09:36.593 --> 01:09:37.654
Hee-jeong... Where is she now?

01:09:37.761 --> 01:09:39.657
- Yes?
- Where's Hee-jeong?

01:09:39.763 --> 01:09:41.452
She's gone, too?

01:09:41.598 --> 01:09:44.330
She went to a customer.

01:09:44.642 --> 01:09:46.538
He's a complete lunatic.

01:09:46.644 --> 01:09:48.249
So do you know where he lives?

01:09:48.354 --> 01:09:49.751
No.

01:09:49.856 --> 01:09:50.856
Then where were you two?

01:09:50.857 --> 01:09:52.462
Somewhere around here.

01:09:52.567 --> 01:09:55.673
Was there anything
strange about him?

01:09:55.779 --> 01:09:57.467
A lot.

01:09:57.572 --> 01:09:59.053
Tell me.

01:09:59.282 --> 01:10:02.972
His dick wouldn't get hard.

01:10:03.078 --> 01:10:06.060
Watch what
you say around the kid.

01:10:06.956 --> 01:10:08.312
I mean,

01:10:08.583 --> 01:10:12.358
his penis didn't get erect.

01:10:13.088 --> 01:10:14.192
So?

01:10:14.297 --> 01:10:16.486
No matter how hard I tried,
it wouldn't work.

01:10:16.591 --> 01:10:19.114
He said he wasn't drunk, either.

01:10:19.552 --> 01:10:21.032
That meant he was impotent.

01:10:21.137 --> 01:10:23.451
Why'd an impotent bastard
call me then?

01:10:23.556 --> 01:10:24.452
Then what?

01:10:24.557 --> 01:10:25.954
What else?

01:10:26.059 --> 01:10:28.039
I treated him like a king
so that I can keep the money.

01:10:28.144 --> 01:10:31.960
Then he kept calling me,
asking me to live with him.

01:10:32.065 --> 01:10:34.421
I got aggravated
so I didn't answer.

01:10:34.567 --> 01:10:35.880
Then that crazy bastard

01:10:35.985 --> 01:10:38.843
started sending me
strange pictures.

01:10:39.656 --> 01:10:42.762
He was covered with blood
and said he'd kill me.

01:10:42.867 --> 01:10:46.975
He kept bothering me like that
for several days.

01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:48.393
Do you still have the pictures?

01:10:48.498 --> 01:10:51.522
Are you crazy?
I erased all of them.

01:10:53.169 --> 01:10:54.733
Okay.

01:10:55.171 --> 01:10:57.027
Did he do something?

01:10:57.674 --> 01:10:59.738
He killed someone, didn't he?

01:11:01.469 --> 01:11:03.450
Hey, mister!

01:11:04.264 --> 01:11:05.953
Mister!

01:11:07.058 --> 01:11:08.539
Hey...

01:12:42.570 --> 01:12:44.343
Don't go anywhere.

01:12:45.073 --> 01:12:46.846
- Where is it?
- Over here.

01:12:49.452 --> 01:12:50.933
Here.

01:13:13.476 --> 01:13:14.664
Are you sure this is it?

01:13:14.769 --> 01:13:16.750
Yes, look.

01:13:21.484 --> 01:13:23.632
Is this the wrong place?

01:13:27.574 --> 01:13:29.470
Tell me what's going on.

01:13:29.576 --> 01:13:30.889
Search some more with the keys.

01:13:30.994 --> 01:13:31.890
Why?

01:13:31.995 --> 01:13:34.143
Mi-Jin isn't here, idiot!

01:13:46.676 --> 01:13:48.532
Let's go.

01:13:56.561 --> 01:13:58.250
Meathead!

01:14:58.164 --> 01:15:00.354
- Where did he go?
- I don't know!

01:15:00.583 --> 01:15:01.939
You go over there.

01:15:17.434 --> 01:15:22.126
I told you I'd pay you back,
asshole!

01:15:23.356 --> 01:15:25.629
I have to live, too!

01:15:31.948 --> 01:15:34.262
Why'd he call me out
in such a hurry?

01:15:34.367 --> 01:15:36.055
It's a big headache.

01:15:36.161 --> 01:15:38.142
Damn it.

01:15:39.456 --> 01:15:41.562
- Eun-shil, go wash up.
- Okay.

01:15:46.963 --> 01:15:50.154
Did you laugh? Did you?

01:15:55.764 --> 01:15:59.121
Get up, asshole.
We have a guest.

01:16:01.478 --> 01:16:04.752
Son of a bitch.

01:16:04.981 --> 01:16:07.338
Wake me up if anyone comes.

01:16:14.991 --> 01:16:16.554
Where is Kim Mi-Jin?

01:16:16.659 --> 01:16:18.766
I don't know who she is.

01:16:19.996 --> 01:16:21.893
Where is she?

01:16:21.998 --> 01:16:25.231
Where is she? Answer me!

01:16:26.670 --> 01:16:28.317
Spare me.

01:16:30.548 --> 01:16:32.070
Where is she?

01:16:32.175 --> 01:16:35.115
I really don't know.
Spare me.

01:16:53.697 --> 01:16:56.136
We shared the same prison cell.

01:16:56.491 --> 01:16:58.429
He visited me 4 months ago.

01:16:58.535 --> 01:17:02.726
He needed a place to stay
for 2 weeks.

01:17:03.456 --> 01:17:06.522
I haven't seen him since then.

01:17:06.751 --> 01:17:10.149
Oh yeah, I saw him once.

01:17:10.255 --> 01:17:14.070
He came in and took his bag
while I was asleep.

01:17:14.175 --> 01:17:15.531
What sort of bag?

01:17:24.394 --> 01:17:27.543
A large black bag.

01:17:27.689 --> 01:17:29.586
It had all kinds of tools in it.

01:17:29.691 --> 01:17:30.628
What tools?

01:17:30.734 --> 01:17:33.424
Just tools.

01:17:33.862 --> 01:17:36.342
Like a chisel, hammer and saw.

01:17:36.448 --> 01:17:38.345
Did he say where he was going?

01:17:38.450 --> 01:17:39.847
No.

01:18:02.182 --> 01:18:03.536
Who painted all this?

01:18:03.641 --> 01:18:05.539
He did.

01:18:06.644 --> 01:18:08.042
No.

01:18:09.439 --> 01:18:11.169
Then what about a girlfriend?

01:18:11.274 --> 01:18:12.630
No.

01:18:14.569 --> 01:18:18.843
Have you ever had a girlfriend?

01:18:18.948 --> 01:18:20.304
Yes.

01:18:20.450 --> 01:18:23.432
How long was your relationship?

01:18:25.288 --> 01:18:26.852
About a year.

01:18:27.165 --> 01:18:32.358
Then you must've had
sex with her.

01:18:34.464 --> 01:18:38.030
Why? Are you embarrassed?

01:18:38.551 --> 01:18:41.534
Just tell me.

01:18:42.555 --> 01:18:46.622
Have you ever had sex
with your girlfriend?

01:18:48.144 --> 01:18:50.334
Mr. Ji.

01:18:51.356 --> 01:18:54.922
Have you ever had sex
with a woman?

01:18:55.151 --> 01:18:57.258
Why do you want to know?

01:18:58.488 --> 01:19:01.637
Don't answer
if you don't want to.

01:19:01.991 --> 01:19:04.556
I'll ask something else.
At your house...

01:19:04.661 --> 01:19:07.059
I asked you.
Why you do you want to know?

01:19:09.499 --> 01:19:12.355
I thought that
you might be impotent.

01:19:12.460 --> 01:19:15.317
How would you know?
Have you seen it?

01:19:18.758 --> 01:19:21.740
Because assholes like you
mostly are.

01:19:28.768 --> 01:19:30.332
You're impotent, aren't you?

01:19:31.479 --> 01:19:32.959
When you see a woman,

01:19:33.064 --> 01:19:36.462
you want to have sex
but you can't.

01:19:36.568 --> 01:19:40.342
So you kill them
with a chisel, right?

01:19:41.489 --> 01:19:44.554
You think
the chisel is your penis.

01:19:44.659 --> 01:19:49.058
The pleasure from hammering
the chisel on a woman's head.

01:19:49.164 --> 01:19:49.851
Stop it.

01:19:49.956 --> 01:19:52.437
You killed young women
because of that pleasure.

01:19:52.542 --> 01:19:55.733
Stop it. That's not it.

01:19:57.756 --> 01:20:00.154
That's not why.

01:20:05.388 --> 01:20:06.952
Are you curious?

01:20:07.974 --> 01:20:09.663
I'll tell you.

01:20:10.060 --> 01:20:11.665
Why'd you kill them?

01:20:19.861 --> 01:20:22.343
Come here.
I'll tell you why.

01:20:23.365 --> 01:20:24.845
Come over here.

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:32.477
- Just sit down.
- I'll tell you.

01:20:32.582 --> 01:20:34.355
Go sit down, you bastard.

01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:37.525
Sit.

01:20:53.853 --> 01:20:56.543
I'm right, aren't I?

01:20:56.648 --> 01:21:00.338
You want to have sex,
but your body can't.

01:21:00.443 --> 01:21:02.258
So the women...

01:21:03.154 --> 01:21:04.759
- What do you know?
- Let go!

01:21:04.864 --> 01:21:06.846
What do you know?

01:21:07.075 --> 01:21:08.764
Stop it!

01:21:09.869 --> 01:21:15.145
Why do you keep
bothering me? Why?

01:21:16.292 --> 01:21:17.648
Bravo.

01:22:02.339 --> 01:22:03.381
Hey, where's the kid?

01:22:03.465 --> 01:22:05.236
What?

01:22:05.342 --> 01:22:06.654
Where's the kid?

01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:08.949
- What?
- You dumb ass.

01:22:20.857 --> 01:22:22.838
Go that way, idiot!

01:23:06.361 --> 01:23:08.258
Over here! Hurry!

01:23:08.363 --> 01:23:10.553
- Hurry!
- This way!

01:23:28.383 --> 01:23:29.988
Are you her father?

01:23:30.093 --> 01:23:32.741
You didn't sign here.

01:24:09.174 --> 01:24:10.361
From now on, we're searching

01:24:10.467 --> 01:24:12.530
Mangwon to find
Ji Young-min's place.

01:24:12.635 --> 01:24:15.742
The residents will be awake,
and we'll have more backup.

01:24:15.847 --> 01:24:19.037
We have no warrant and
no approval, so by 12,

01:24:19.142 --> 01:24:22.665
bring back any evidence,
if you need to fake it, got it?

01:24:22.771 --> 01:24:23.958
Yes, sir.

01:24:24.064 --> 01:24:27.462
You call that a response,
you bastards?

01:24:27.567 --> 01:24:29.131
Yes, sir!

01:24:42.791 --> 01:24:45.730
Tell me where it is!

01:24:45.835 --> 01:24:47.650
Where is it?

01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:52.530
Answer me, you asshole!

01:24:55.178 --> 01:24:56.449
Tell me!

01:24:56.554 --> 01:24:58.827
Where is it? Where is it?

01:24:59.349 --> 01:25:02.540
Answer me, you son of a bitch!

01:25:03.478 --> 01:25:04.834
What's the matter?

01:25:07.565 --> 01:25:08.921
What is it?

01:25:21.538 --> 01:25:23.143
Go inside.

01:25:23.456 --> 01:25:25.853
What happened?

01:25:25.959 --> 01:25:27.523
What did he say?

01:25:28.878 --> 01:25:31.652
He confessed.
Mangwon, 893-1.

01:25:55.071 --> 01:25:57.720
- Move your ass!
- Get in there fast!

01:25:58.158 --> 01:26:00.471
Dig deep all around, got it?

01:26:00.577 --> 01:26:01.472
Yes, sir.

01:26:01.578 --> 01:26:03.225
Run inside!

01:26:05.248 --> 01:26:07.563
Hurry up!

01:26:08.084 --> 01:26:10.356
Dig inside!

01:26:10.462 --> 01:26:11.983
You bastard!

01:26:12.088 --> 01:26:13.484
Where were you?

01:26:13.590 --> 01:26:16.739
You can't dig
with a walkie-talkie, idiot!

01:26:18.762 --> 01:26:21.076
Come over here.
There's something strange here.

01:26:23.433 --> 01:26:26.039
Not there, come over here.
There's something strange.

01:26:26.144 --> 01:26:27.541
Yeah?

01:26:28.646 --> 01:26:30.752
Hey, hang it over there.

01:26:30.857 --> 01:26:32.213
Yes, sir.

01:26:35.278 --> 01:26:36.174
Is there anything?

01:26:36.279 --> 01:26:38.676
Look, isn't this blood?

01:26:38.782 --> 01:26:42.139
Not blood.
It looks like hot sauce.

01:26:43.578 --> 01:26:45.142
It is hot sauce.

01:26:45.288 --> 01:26:46.936
Asshole.

01:26:47.874 --> 01:26:50.188
That means he's worked here
up until 6 months ago.

01:26:50.293 --> 01:26:50.855
Yes.

01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:52.357
And you didn't know
when he came and went?

01:26:52.462 --> 01:26:57.153
How would I know
if he sneaked in here at night?

01:26:57.258 --> 01:26:58.947
Do you know
how many people he's killed?

01:26:59.052 --> 01:27:00.949
Shit, this is crazy.

01:27:01.054 --> 01:27:02.867
I really don't know anything!

01:27:02.972 --> 01:27:05.329
- Don't yell at me.
- It's not here.

01:27:05.975 --> 01:27:07.540
Get out.

01:27:07.977 --> 01:27:10.543
- If we find...
- Mi-Jin isn't here.

01:27:11.481 --> 01:27:15.047
We're right here.

01:27:15.151 --> 01:27:17.048
Her car is parked here.

01:27:17.153 --> 01:27:18.843
This doesn't make sense.

01:27:19.781 --> 01:27:21.052
Why doesn't it?

01:27:21.157 --> 01:27:24.557
It's more than a 20-minute walk
from her car to here.

01:27:25.078 --> 01:27:25.974
It's here.

01:27:26.079 --> 01:27:27.643
5 minutes away.

01:27:27.872 --> 01:27:28.977
Let's search there.

01:27:29.082 --> 01:27:30.937
With the men we have,
we can finish quickly.

01:27:31.042 --> 01:27:32.939
He told us he buried them here!

01:27:33.044 --> 01:27:35.609
That asshole is talking bullshit!

01:27:37.465 --> 01:27:39.530
You bastard.

01:27:39.968 --> 01:27:42.950
What's with you?
Is it because of the money?

01:27:44.055 --> 01:27:46.328
When will you get
your act straight?

01:27:46.766 --> 01:27:48.663
I don't believe this.

01:27:48.768 --> 01:27:52.251
Ji Young-min is on his way now.
Let's talk when he comes.

01:27:53.773 --> 01:27:55.461
Why do you move so slowly?

01:27:55.567 --> 01:27:56.963
I'm sorry, sir.

01:27:57.068 --> 01:27:58.465
Hey!

01:27:58.862 --> 01:28:00.174
I told you to cover his face.

01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:02.468
- Sorry, sir.
- Get the mask.

01:28:02.574 --> 01:28:04.430
Morons.

01:28:04.868 --> 01:28:06.556
Get moving!
Put him in the car!

01:28:06.661 --> 01:28:08.434
Yes, sir.

01:28:09.039 --> 01:28:11.937
Move your asses, will you?

01:28:12.250 --> 01:28:15.024
You seem busy.

01:28:20.884 --> 01:28:24.950
Ji Young-min, you should say hi
if you had seen me.

01:28:28.266 --> 01:28:31.040
Take off your cap.

01:28:35.398 --> 01:28:37.713
Damn it, you ignorant cops.

01:28:39.652 --> 01:28:41.342
Have you lost your mind?

01:28:43.948 --> 01:28:48.015
Suspect of the Mapo murder case
was arrested.

01:28:48.244 --> 01:28:52.019
It's pitiful, isn't it?

01:28:53.583 --> 01:28:55.146
I understand.

01:28:55.251 --> 01:28:59.776
Shit splashes on the mayor's face.
You must be scared to death.

01:28:59.881 --> 01:29:04.365
Set Young-min free this instant,
and bring your men back.

01:29:04.594 --> 01:29:07.367
How about we do this?
The DNA results will be out soon.

01:29:07.472 --> 01:29:11.747
If people find out about this,
how would they react?

01:29:12.769 --> 01:29:15.667
A cop who got shit
on the mayor's face

01:29:15.772 --> 01:29:19.630
forced an innocent citizen
to be a serial killer to save face.

01:29:20.276 --> 01:29:24.343
But that citizen's face
was pulverized.

01:29:26.658 --> 01:29:30.348
Stop what you're doing and tell me
who did that to Young-min.

01:29:30.453 --> 01:29:32.267
Drag him down here now.

01:29:32.372 --> 01:29:34.353
I'll do everything
to get him fired.

01:29:34.457 --> 01:29:36.688
What the hell's wrong with you?

01:29:36.793 --> 01:29:38.273
- Jung-ho!
- Let go.

01:29:38.378 --> 01:29:40.275
Jung-ho, come here!

01:29:40.380 --> 01:29:43.444
He's calling me, idiot!

01:29:43.550 --> 01:29:45.906
He's calling me, asshole.
You better watch it!

01:29:50.265 --> 01:29:52.745
You have to hurry and go.

01:29:52.851 --> 01:29:54.540
Where to?

01:29:54.853 --> 01:29:55.957
Stay still, asshole.

01:29:56.062 --> 01:29:57.166
Bastard.

01:29:57.272 --> 01:29:59.043
Hurry and catch him!

01:29:59.149 --> 01:30:03.048
Are you out of your minds?

01:30:04.779 --> 01:30:07.677
Why?

01:30:07.782 --> 01:30:08.825
What's with this?

01:30:08.867 --> 01:30:09.909
What?

01:30:09.993 --> 01:30:11.264
Jung-ho!

01:30:11.369 --> 01:30:12.412
What's going on?

01:30:12.495 --> 01:30:14.183
The chief said to bring you in!

01:30:14.289 --> 01:30:16.854
So why'd you hit him, idiot?

01:30:17.334 --> 01:30:19.939
Go away!
I'll chop you down!

01:30:20.045 --> 01:30:21.232
It's all over!

01:30:21.338 --> 01:30:23.443
We have to give up the case
and set Young-min free!

01:30:23.548 --> 01:30:25.862
Why? Are you crazy?

01:30:25.967 --> 01:30:28.573
We don't have any power!
The prosecutor told us to!

01:30:28.678 --> 01:30:31.367
If he goes out,
what about Mi-Jin?

01:30:31.473 --> 01:30:35.079
She's dead.
She died a long time ago!

01:30:35.185 --> 01:30:37.373
So put that down now!

01:30:37.479 --> 01:30:40.169
Why would she die, you asshole?

01:30:42.192 --> 01:30:44.632
Grab that bastard!

01:30:44.986 --> 01:30:47.051
Catch him! Run faster!

01:30:48.865 --> 01:30:50.721
Over there!

01:30:51.868 --> 01:30:53.724
That way! Hurry!

01:30:56.873 --> 01:30:59.647
- Catch him!
- Run fast!

01:30:59.876 --> 01:31:02.525
Bastards!

01:31:02.879 --> 01:31:05.945
Catch him!

01:31:07.884 --> 01:31:10.073
Stay still, you bastard!

01:31:10.178 --> 01:31:11.366
- Make him not move!
- You sons of bitches!

01:31:11.471 --> 01:31:13.827
Hey! You sons of bitches!

01:31:14.474 --> 01:31:16.664
Let go!

01:31:19.979 --> 01:31:21.668
Open the door!

01:31:21.773 --> 01:31:23.546
Get in!

01:31:24.150 --> 01:31:27.007
Get in there!

01:31:54.764 --> 01:31:57.161
Why didn't you just kill me
with the hoe?

01:31:57.267 --> 01:31:59.331
That's enough.

01:32:01.354 --> 01:32:03.335
Give me a cigarette.

01:32:04.941 --> 01:32:07.755
Ji-man, give me a cigarette.

01:32:07.861 --> 01:32:09.633
Damn it.

01:32:09.946 --> 01:32:11.635
Give it.

01:32:18.663 --> 01:32:20.227
Give me a lighter.

01:32:22.167 --> 01:32:26.150
Kyung-suk,
still working back door?

01:32:26.671 --> 01:32:31.029
Buy your mom some good food
after ripping off businesses?

01:32:31.134 --> 01:32:34.909
It's you who's made big money,
you bastard.

01:32:35.055 --> 01:32:37.535
Kyung-suk and I
made some money back then.

01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:40.247
Shit, but I was the
only one who got fired.

01:32:43.271 --> 01:32:45.127
Isn't that right?

01:32:45.648 --> 01:32:49.881
Is your wallet full
from sucking that pig's ass?

01:32:49.986 --> 01:32:52.426
- Does your mother know that?
- What the...

01:33:21.059 --> 01:33:22.831
Give me the key.

01:33:23.770 --> 01:33:25.459
Hurry.

01:33:26.773 --> 01:33:28.670
Where's Ji Young-min?

01:33:28.775 --> 01:33:30.464
He's probably out now.

01:33:30.985 --> 01:33:32.842
Shit.

01:35:19.135 --> 01:35:21.116
Taxi! Taxi!

01:36:28.872 --> 01:36:31.020
Anybody here?

01:36:31.166 --> 01:36:33.062
Anybody here?

01:36:33.168 --> 01:36:34.648
Yes?

01:36:35.170 --> 01:36:37.150
- Oh, my goodness!
- Call the police!

01:36:37.255 --> 01:36:38.819
Hurry!

01:37:42.570 --> 01:37:44.050
Ma'am.

01:37:44.155 --> 01:37:45.198
Ma'am!

01:37:45.281 --> 01:37:46.720
Yes.

01:37:47.367 --> 01:37:48.555
Oh, hello.

01:37:48.660 --> 01:37:50.349
- Cigarettes?
- Yes.

01:37:52.288 --> 01:37:55.478
What happened to your face?

01:37:55.583 --> 01:37:56.771
It was some lunatic.

01:37:56.876 --> 01:38:00.359
Why are there so many lunatics
in this neighborhood?

01:38:02.173 --> 01:38:03.444
What's wrong?

01:38:03.550 --> 01:38:04.946
I'm scared to death.

01:38:05.051 --> 01:38:06.364
Stay with us for a while.

01:38:06.469 --> 01:38:07.740
- Why?
- Well,

01:38:07.846 --> 01:38:11.829
some lunatic locked up a girl
and tried to kill her.

01:38:12.350 --> 01:38:13.831
Is that so?

01:38:14.144 --> 01:38:17.459
Maybe it's the same guy
who hit you.

01:38:18.565 --> 01:38:19.669
Have a nice day.

01:38:19.774 --> 01:38:21.754
Just stay here a little longer!

01:38:21.860 --> 01:38:25.134
- Why?
- What if that lunatic comes here?

01:38:25.655 --> 01:38:27.636
Why would he come here?

01:38:28.366 --> 01:38:30.764
That girl is here.

01:38:36.666 --> 01:38:39.439
Just wait here
until the police arrive.

01:38:39.544 --> 01:38:42.026
Help yourself to any drinks.

01:38:46.968 --> 01:38:49.241
What's taking the police
so long?

01:38:52.766 --> 01:38:54.078
When did you report it?

01:38:54.184 --> 01:38:56.040
It's been quite a while.

01:39:05.862 --> 01:39:07.551
Why aren't they coming?

01:39:08.490 --> 01:39:10.513
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

01:39:11.034 --> 01:39:13.431
Do you happen to have
a hammer or a club?

01:39:13.536 --> 01:39:14.766
Why?

01:39:14.871 --> 01:39:17.852
Well, I don't have a club.

01:39:17.957 --> 01:39:19.813
Here's a hammer.

01:39:23.963 --> 01:39:27.738
Seeing you stand there like that
makes me feel safe.

01:39:38.061 --> 01:39:40.375
Just stand there like that,

01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:44.713
and when that lunatic comes,
pound his face, okay?

01:41:01.561 --> 01:41:03.250
Hey.

01:41:03.855 --> 01:41:05.043
Wake up.

01:41:05.148 --> 01:41:06.629
Hey.

01:41:10.779 --> 01:41:13.052
You're really unbelievable.

01:41:18.161 --> 01:41:19.975
How did you get out?

01:41:21.790 --> 01:41:23.562
How did you get out?

01:41:31.966 --> 01:41:34.114
Damn it.

01:43:30.794 --> 01:43:35.361
What happened?

01:43:43.056 --> 01:43:45.370
Gil-woo! Gil-woo!

01:43:45.475 --> 01:43:47.248
Gil-woo! Gil-woo!

01:43:52.357 --> 01:43:54.129
Mi-Jin!

01:43:58.154 --> 01:43:59.552
Mi-Jin...

01:44:04.577 --> 01:44:07.059
Gil-woo... Gil-woo!

01:44:07.872 --> 01:44:09.394
- You have to leave.
- Stop.

01:44:09.499 --> 01:44:11.021
Don't push!

01:44:13.670 --> 01:44:15.109
Hey!

01:44:17.549 --> 01:44:19.738
Hey!

01:44:22.262 --> 01:44:23.826
Hey!

01:44:24.180 --> 01:44:26.036
Hey!

01:44:26.850 --> 01:44:28.330
Gil-woo!

01:45:36.878 --> 01:45:38.442
Look after the kid.

01:46:12.580 --> 01:46:14.352
He sent me
a strange text message.

01:46:14.457 --> 01:46:15.562
He covered his body with blood.

01:46:15.667 --> 01:46:17.355
Hurry and tell me.

01:46:17.460 --> 01:46:18.941
Right there.

01:46:21.297 --> 01:46:22.777
What about the telecom company?

01:46:22.882 --> 01:46:24.737
No judge's approval on Sunday.

01:46:24.843 --> 01:46:26.864
Tell him to issue it
before I kill someone!

01:46:26.970 --> 01:46:28.534
What bastard was it?

01:46:28.763 --> 01:46:30.743
Who spilled the beans?

01:46:30.849 --> 01:46:32.746
I told you to watch your mouth!

01:46:54.998 --> 01:46:56.937
Jung-ho.

01:46:57.542 --> 01:46:59.315
Jung-ho, it's me.

01:47:00.045 --> 01:47:02.443
You're not answering your phone.

01:47:03.256 --> 01:47:05.738
Don't get mad and listen to me.

01:47:07.844 --> 01:47:10.242
I want to quit.

01:47:12.057 --> 01:47:14.538
I really can't take it.

01:47:15.268 --> 01:47:19.835
I'm too scared to do this job.

01:48:15.954 --> 01:48:17.852
<i>"Mangwon church"</i>

01:48:40.270 --> 01:48:43.544
Here doggie, doggie.

01:48:43.773 --> 01:48:46.714
Here you are.

01:49:22.270 --> 01:49:23.834
May I help you?

01:49:31.071 --> 01:49:34.053
Do you know him?

01:49:58.473 --> 01:50:00.370
Mr. Park Dong-won.

01:50:00.475 --> 01:50:02.831
He worked in construction.

01:50:03.186 --> 01:50:06.752
He helped to expand
the church recently.

01:50:06.981 --> 01:50:08.838
I saw him then.

01:50:09.567 --> 01:50:12.258
He made that cross.

01:50:12.779 --> 01:50:15.261
He's very talented.

01:50:15.865 --> 01:50:18.076
If you ask Mr.
Park, he may know him.

01:50:18.727 --> 01:50:20.082
<i>"Park Dong-won"</i>

01:50:37.679 --> 01:50:39.243
Mangwon district, 24-1

01:51:47.374 --> 01:51:48.729
Where are you going?

01:51:51.795 --> 01:51:53.359
Let's go inside.

01:56:55.473 --> 01:56:57.037
Where is he?

01:56:57.142 --> 01:56:58.329
Here!

01:56:58.435 --> 01:56:59.915
Freeze!

01:57:07.152 --> 01:57:10.926
You bastard, what are you doing?

01:57:15.076 --> 01:57:18.434
Jung-ho, put it down.

01:57:22.459 --> 01:57:26.942
Jung-ho, that's enough.

01:58:50.046 --> 01:58:52.361
Get it right over there!

01:59:39.763 --> 01:59:41.577
Where are all the reporters?
