11:34.258 --> 11:35.912
I'M SURE THAT'S GONNA
END REALLY WELL.

11:35.956 --> 11:38.175
MONTOYA DOESN'T NEED
TO KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THIS.

11:38.219 --> 11:42.658
OK. I SEE. IT'S FINE
WHEN WE THROW ALICE IN ARKHAM,

11:42.702 --> 11:46.096
BUT, OH, POOR, SWEET,
INNOCENT MARY,

11:46.140 --> 11:48.708
YEAH, WE SHOULD
PROTECT HER AT ALL COSTS.

11:51.058 --> 11:53.060
-WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
-WHAT ONE DOES

11:53.103 --> 11:54.626
WHEN THEY REALIZE
THEY CAN CONTROL

11:54.670 --> 11:56.585
MOTHER FREAKING EARTH.

11:56.628 --> 11:59.153
I NEARLY KILLED SOMEONE,
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY

11:59.196 --> 12:02.896
OR WHEN THIS INFECTION IS
GONNA MAKE ME TRANSFORM AGAIN,

12:02.939 --> 12:04.724
AND UNTIL WE FIGURE
IT OUT,

12:04.767 --> 12:07.509
I AM A THREAT TO EVERYONE...

12:07.552 --> 12:09.076
[MOUTHS WORDS]
NOT ME.

12:09.119 --> 12:11.078
SO I'M STAYING RIGHT HERE.

12:23.655 --> 12:26.833
WELL, YOU CAN TAKE
THE GIRL OUT OF THE GCPD.

12:28.660 --> 12:30.358
LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT
THE SAME PARTNER.

12:30.401 --> 12:31.881
SOPHIE MOORE.

12:31.925 --> 12:33.535
ONLY A FELLOW WORKAHOLIC
WOULD ASSUME

12:33.578 --> 12:36.320
I'D BE AT THE OFFICE
AT 2 A.M.

12:36.364 --> 12:37.931
THIS IS AN OFFICE?

12:37.974 --> 12:39.497
WOULDN'T HAVE GUESSED.

12:39.541 --> 12:41.282
I MEAN, I THOUGHT
DETECTIVE MONTOYA

12:41.325 --> 12:43.371
WAS ON TRACK TO BE
THE NEXT COMMISSIONER.

12:43.414 --> 12:46.591
NOW YOU'RE SHARING
A BASEMENT WITH
A LEAKY PIPE. OUCH.

12:46.635 --> 12:49.464
AT LEAST I HAVE A JOB.

12:49.507 --> 12:51.292
I QUIT THE CROWS
BY CHOICE.

12:51.335 --> 12:54.164
RIGHT BEFORE KANE'S
OWN AGENTS TRIED TO KILL HIM?

12:54.208 --> 12:56.166
REAL PROFILE IN COURAGE.

12:56.210 --> 12:58.734
I'M HERE TO LET
YOU RETURN A FAVOR.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.606
EXCUSE ME.
THEN PLEASE GO ON.

13:01.650 --> 13:03.260
I'D LOVE TO HEAR
WHAT YOU'VE DONE FOR ME

13:03.304 --> 13:04.914
OTHER THAN FLASH
YOUR CROWS BADGE

13:04.958 --> 13:07.917
TO STEAL MY BEST CASES.

13:07.961 --> 13:10.833
IF I WEREN'T WILLING
TO BABYSIT ALICE,

13:10.877 --> 13:12.966
YOU'D NEVER BE ABLE
TO PROVE TO THE MAYOR

13:13.009 --> 13:16.360
THAT YOU'RE CAPABLE
OF COLLECTING ALL
THESE BATMAN WEAPONS,

13:16.404 --> 13:18.623
AND WE BOTH KNOW
WITHOUT ALICE

13:18.667 --> 13:21.626
NONE OF THESE CASES
ARE GETTING SOLVED.

13:21.670 --> 13:24.586
FINE. I'LL BITE. WHAT?

13:26.893 --> 13:29.330
SOMEONE EXPERIMENTED
ON MY SISTER

13:29.373 --> 13:32.028
WITH A VARIANT
OF VICTOR FRIES'
FREEZE SERUM.

13:32.072 --> 13:34.335
I NEED ALL THE DATA
YOUR TASKFORCE
COLLECTED ON FRIES

13:34.378 --> 13:35.815
AND THAT SERUM.

13:35.858 --> 13:37.207
WE DON'T HAVE HALF
OF WHAT BATWOMAN DOES.

13:37.251 --> 13:38.556
AREN'T YOU PALS?

13:38.600 --> 13:39.862
GO SHINE A FLASHLIGHT
IN THE AIR.

13:39.906 --> 13:41.168
I WOULD EXCEPT
WE'RE NOT SEEING

13:41.211 --> 13:43.213
EYE TO EYE ON THIS.

13:43.257 --> 13:44.954
DRAMA.

13:44.998 --> 13:47.739
YOU WANT ME TO GET
TWO STRAWS?

13:47.783 --> 13:49.654
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT
THE BLACK GLOVE SOCIETY,

13:49.698 --> 13:51.221
SPECIFICALLY HIM?

13:51.265 --> 13:54.355
THIS GUY LED
THE EXPERIMENTS.

13:54.398 --> 13:56.313
IS YOUR SISTER OK?

13:56.357 --> 13:59.447
DO YOU ACTUALLY CARE?

13:59.490 --> 14:01.579
IF YOUR SISTER SURVIVED
WHAT THEY DID TO HER,

14:01.623 --> 14:03.277
THEN I'D COUNT
MY LUCKY STARS,

14:03.320 --> 14:05.279
AND THEN I'D FORGET
I EVER HEARD OF BLACK GLOVE.

14:05.322 --> 14:08.064
-WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
-ABSOLUTELY NOTHING

14:08.108 --> 14:10.066
EXCEPT THAT EVERYONE
WHO KNOWS ANYTHING

14:10.110 --> 14:13.200
ABOUT BLACK GLOVE
USUALLY ENDS UP DEAD.

14:14.984 --> 14:17.813
CAREFUL, MOORE.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.946
THERE ARE WORSE THINGS
THAN ENDING UP LIKE ME.

14:24.515 --> 14:26.474
DO YOU REMEMBER
MEETING HIM ON TWINGE?

14:26.517 --> 14:28.606
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
I WAS ON TWINGE.

14:28.650 --> 14:31.131
I'VE NEVER SEEN
THIS GUY BEFORE
IN MY LIFE.

14:31.174 --> 14:34.786
ARE YOUR EYES GREEN
IN YOUR PROFILE PICTURE?

14:34.830 --> 14:38.660
NO. I THINK IT'S
JUST BAD LIGHTING.

14:38.703 --> 14:40.270
MARY: MAYBE HE WAS
STALKING ME,

14:40.314 --> 14:43.360
OR MAYBE HE WAS SOME
DATE RAPE GUY

14:43.404 --> 14:45.275
AND I FOUND OUT ABOUT IT.

14:45.319 --> 14:46.973
[COMPUTER BEEPS]

14:47.016 --> 14:50.324
LUKE: UH, SEEMS LIKE
HE JUST WASN'T
THAT INTO YOU.

14:50.367 --> 14:51.847
YEAH. ACCORDING
TO YOUR DMs,

14:51.891 --> 14:54.719
WHICH I MERELY SKIMMED
FOR KEY WORDS,

14:54.763 --> 14:58.332
HE SAID YOU SEEMED
"SWEET."

14:58.375 --> 15:02.336
OHH! OH.

15:02.379 --> 15:04.860
SO YOU SUFFOCATED
HIM IN HONEY.

15:04.904 --> 15:07.602
CLEVER GIRL. HEH.

15:07.645 --> 15:10.213
I THINK I WANT TO
DATE POISON IVY MARY.

15:10.257 --> 15:12.085
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

15:12.128 --> 15:15.653
HOLD ON.
REJECTION?

15:15.697 --> 15:18.221
I ALMOST TOOK
AN INNOCENT MAN'S LIFE.

15:18.265 --> 15:20.832
OK. MARY'S RIGHT.
THAT'S A PRETTY
SCREWED UP REASON

15:20.876 --> 15:22.573
TO NEARLY DROWN A GUY.

15:22.617 --> 15:25.576
I DON'T KNOW.
IS IT, THOUGH?

15:25.620 --> 15:29.102
I MEAN, I'VE NEVER BEEN
ACCUSED OF BEING, UM, SWEET,

15:29.145 --> 15:32.018
BUT, UH, IT'S BASICALLY
LIKE SAYING,

15:32.061 --> 15:35.543
YOU KNOW, "YOU'RE PLEASANT
BUT INSTANTLY FORGETTABLE."

15:35.586 --> 15:38.546
IT'S LIKE THE BEIGE
OF COMPLIMENTS,

15:38.589 --> 15:40.765
-THE SWIPE LEFT OF NICE--
-WE GET IT.

15:40.809 --> 15:44.291
RYAN: YOU DON'T
REALLY THINK THAT'S HOW
PEOPLE SEE YOU, RIGHT?

15:44.334 --> 15:47.685
LUKE: HEY. DO YOU REMEMBER
GOING TO A HARDWARE STORE
THIS MORNING?

15:47.729 --> 15:49.209
MARY: SHOULD I?

15:49.252 --> 15:51.472
LUKE: WELL, YOU BOUGHT
A FLOWERING POT,

15:51.515 --> 15:53.778
FERTILIZER,
AND A WATERING CAN,

15:53.822 --> 15:55.519
AND ACCORDING TO YOUR
PHONE'S GEO DATA,

15:55.563 --> 15:57.478
ONCE YOU LEFT THE STORE,
YOU WENT TO A VACANT LOT

15:57.521 --> 15:59.219
IN BURNSIDE.

16:01.221 --> 16:03.571
PLEASE DON'T TELL ME
I HURT ANYONE ELSE.

16:21.937 --> 16:24.853
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT MARY?

16:24.896 --> 16:26.855
I WAS WONDERING HOW THIS
WOULD END UP MY FAULT.

16:26.898 --> 16:29.336
YOU OBVIOUSLY KNEW
SOMETHING WAS UP.

16:29.379 --> 16:30.946
HOW'D YOU FIGURE
IT OUT?

16:30.990 --> 16:32.469
UH, THE QUESTION
ISN'T HOW I
FIGURED IT OUT.

16:32.513 --> 16:33.818
IT'S HOW THE HELL
YOU DIDN'T.

16:33.862 --> 16:35.255
YOU'RE HER ROOMMATE,

16:35.298 --> 16:36.604
YOU HAVE
A BILLION DOLLARS

16:36.647 --> 16:38.258
OF BATTECH
AT YOUR DISPOSAL,

16:38.301 --> 16:40.086
AND YOUR NUMBER TWO IS
A CERTIFIABLE GENIUS.

16:40.129 --> 16:42.131
ONE OF YOU
SHOULD HAVE NOTICED.

16:42.175 --> 16:44.090
THE FERTILIZER BAG IS EMPTY,

16:44.133 --> 16:46.788
BUT THE GROUND'S
NOT DISTURBED.

16:46.831 --> 16:51.053
NOTHING WAS PLANTED.
WHY WAS MARY HERE?

16:51.097 --> 16:53.316
[GASPS]

16:53.360 --> 16:56.667
MARY HAMILTON,
YOU DIRTY GIRL.

16:56.711 --> 16:58.452
[COUGHS]

16:58.495 --> 17:00.497
HE'S STILL ALIVE.

17:00.541 --> 17:02.934
OH. WELL, IT'S ONLY
HER FIRST DAY.

17:02.978 --> 17:04.806
I WONDER WHAT THIS GUY
DID TO MARY.

17:04.849 --> 17:07.504
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT HE TRIED TO KILL
SOPHIE AND ME

17:07.548 --> 17:09.332
AND FREEZE
SOPHIE'S SISTER.

17:09.376 --> 17:11.117
SOMEHOW, MARY
MANAGED TO TURN ONE

17:11.160 --> 17:13.510
OF BLACK GLOVE'S MOST
DANGEROUS OPERATIVES

17:13.554 --> 17:17.079
INTO A, UH,
GARDEN TURNIP.

17:17.123 --> 17:19.603
I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S
IMPRESSIVE OR JUST

17:19.647 --> 17:21.301
REALLY, REALLY BAD.

17:21.344 --> 17:22.780
I DON'T SUPPOSE
YOU HAVE A BATSHOVEL

17:22.824 --> 17:25.740
IN THAT BELT.

17:25.783 --> 17:27.089
RIGHT.

17:27.133 --> 17:28.221
[COUGHS]

17:33.835 --> 17:36.403
OH. SORRY.
HOW DID I TRACK DOWN

17:36.446 --> 17:38.883
AN ELUSIVE BLACK OPS
ORGANIZATION?

17:38.927 --> 17:41.016
UH, YOU TRACKED THE P.O. BOX
VIRGIL GETTY WAS USING

17:41.060 --> 17:42.452
THROUGH THE COMPANY
THAT SOLD HIM

17:42.496 --> 17:43.932
THE CRYOGENIC
MEDICAL SUPPLIES

17:43.975 --> 17:46.021
THAT HE USED
ON THE FREEZE SERUM VICTIMS.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.370
RYAN: SOPHIE'S
BEEN A BLOODHOUND
WITH THIS GUY.

17:47.414 --> 17:49.111
I'M SURE SHE
TRIED THAT.

17:49.155 --> 17:51.853
YEAH. WELL, SOPHIE DOESN'T
HAVE AN MD AFTER HER NAME.

17:51.896 --> 17:54.290
IT LOOKS LIKE DR. HAMILTON
USED HER TITLE

17:54.334 --> 17:56.423
TO BYPASS PRIVACY LAWS.

17:56.466 --> 17:58.294
ALICE: VIOLATION
OF MEDICAL ETHICS.

17:58.338 --> 18:00.557
HARLEY QUINN, HERE YOU COME.

18:00.601 --> 18:02.472
PERHAPS SOMEONE SHOULD
TELL SOPHIE

18:02.516 --> 18:04.126
THAT THE GUY WHO TRIED
TO BURN US ALIVE

18:04.170 --> 18:05.780
AND FREEZE HER SISTER
TO DEATH IS HANGING

18:05.823 --> 18:07.608
FROM A SEWER PIPE
UNDER WAYNE.

18:07.651 --> 18:11.177
NO. WE HAVE ENOUGH
PROBLEMS WITHOUT SOPHIE
FINDING MORE.

18:11.220 --> 18:13.222
WELL, "MOORE" IS
LITERALLY HER NAME,

18:13.266 --> 18:15.703
AND AS A VICTIM
OF SOPHIE'S BACKHAND,

18:15.746 --> 18:17.139
I'D SAY SHE CAN
HANDLE HERSELF.

18:17.183 --> 18:19.533
I SAID SHE STAYS
OUT OF IT!

18:19.576 --> 18:21.796
MARY: OK.
CAN WE GET BACK TO ME

18:21.839 --> 18:23.450
FREAKING OUT OVER THE FACT
THAT I'M TURNING

18:23.493 --> 18:26.017
INTO AN UBERVILLAIN
AGAINST MY WILL?

18:26.061 --> 18:27.454
WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?

18:27.497 --> 18:29.456
LUKE: POISON IVY'S
AN ECOTERRORIST.

18:29.499 --> 18:31.632
NEITHER OF YOUR VICTIMS
HAD ANY PUBLIC RECORD

18:31.675 --> 18:33.199
OF ACTIVELY HURTING
THE ENVIRONMENT.

18:33.242 --> 18:34.852
RYAN: YEAH,
BUT THE BATVILLAIN WEAPONS

18:34.896 --> 18:37.072
DON'T NECESSARILY MEAN
THE SAME M.O.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.769
LIAM CRANDLE DIDN'T
HAVE THE SAME AGENDA

18:38.813 --> 18:40.293
AS THE OG MAD HATTER.

18:40.336 --> 18:41.511
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

18:41.555 --> 18:42.904
UM, CHRIS CALLED YOU SWEET,

18:42.947 --> 18:44.427
YOU DIPPED HIM IN HONEY.

18:44.471 --> 18:45.950
VIRGIL FROZE JORDAN,

18:45.994 --> 18:47.561
SO YOU USED MOTHER NATURE
TO IMMOBILIZE HIM.

18:47.604 --> 18:50.259
[SIGHS]

18:50.303 --> 18:52.870
SO...MAYBE
THE CHEMICAL PHEROMONES

18:52.914 --> 18:54.785
FROM THE POISON IVY
ALLOW ME TO COMMUNICATE

18:54.829 --> 18:56.439
WITH NATURE WHILE
HEIGHTENING THE THINGS

18:56.483 --> 18:59.573
THAT I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT
LIKE JUSTICE?

18:59.616 --> 19:01.923
ALICE: WELL, SEEING
AS THAT M.O. TRACKS

19:01.966 --> 19:05.100
AND, UH--AHEM--
I KILLED YOUR MOTHER,

19:05.144 --> 19:07.058
I'M REALLY NOT
LOOKING FORWARD
TO BEING TURNED

19:07.102 --> 19:10.497
INTO A CABBAGE,
SO WE SHOULD FIND OUT

19:10.540 --> 19:12.455
EXACTLY WHAT TURNS
DR. JEKYLL

19:12.499 --> 19:16.198
INTO MRS. HIDE
MY VICTIMS
UNDER A POT.

19:16.242 --> 19:18.635
DAMN IT.

19:18.679 --> 19:20.463
WHAT DOES SHE WANT?

19:20.507 --> 19:23.553
YOU, MY DEAR,

19:23.597 --> 19:25.860
DEAD OR ALIVE.

19:30.212 --> 19:31.822
RYAN: MAKING HOUSE CALLS NOW?

19:33.824 --> 19:35.217
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME YOU FOUND

19:35.261 --> 19:36.653
ANOTHER POISON IVY VIC?

19:36.697 --> 19:37.959
IT'S 5:00 IN THE MORNING.

19:38.002 --> 19:39.482
I FIGURED YOU
WERE ASLEEP.

19:39.526 --> 19:40.918
I DON'T SLEEP, RYAN,
ESPECIALLY WHEN SOMEONE'S

19:40.962 --> 19:42.746
OUT THERE WITH PAM'S
ABILITIES.

19:42.790 --> 19:44.661
-WHERE'S THE VIC?
-IN MY CUSTODY.

19:44.705 --> 19:46.141
YEAH. WELL, I NEED TO
TALK TO HIM.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.099
I NEED TO KNOW WHAT HE SAW,
WHAT HE KNOWS.

19:48.143 --> 19:49.927
HE'S UNCONSCIOUS
AT THE MOMENT.

19:49.971 --> 19:52.016
WHEN HE'S TALKING,
I WILL CALL YOU.

19:52.060 --> 19:53.714
OH. JUST LIKE CHRIS HAYNER?

19:53.757 --> 19:56.499
IS THAT A COINCIDENCE
OR CONVENIENCE?

19:56.543 --> 19:58.806
YOU WANTED TO PARTNER
WITH BATWOMAN, RIGHT?

19:58.849 --> 20:01.635
THEN YOU NEED TO
TRUST MY PROCESS.

20:01.678 --> 20:03.550
ALICE: RYAN IS FLAILING.

20:05.291 --> 20:08.685
WHAT DID YOU MEAN
RENEE WANTED ME
DEAD OR ALIVE?

20:08.729 --> 20:12.515
OH. RENEE AND POISON PAM
HAVE A BACKSTORY.

20:12.559 --> 20:14.735
WHAT KIND OF BACKSTORY?

20:14.778 --> 20:18.217
OH. I DON'T WANT
TO BE A GOSSIP.

20:18.260 --> 20:20.262
LUKE AND MARY: SPILL.

20:20.306 --> 20:22.438
IF YOU INSIST.

20:22.482 --> 20:26.747
SO...THEY MET,
FELL MADLY IN LOVE,

20:26.790 --> 20:28.705
KISSY, KISSY, KISSY.

20:28.749 --> 20:31.926
THEN PAM FELL VICTIM TO SOME
EVIL SCIENTIST'S EXPERIMENT.

20:31.969 --> 20:33.928
OBVIOUSLY PAM'S
METAMORPHOSIS

20:33.971 --> 20:35.843
INTO "LITTLE SHOP
OF HORRORS"

20:35.886 --> 20:37.845
GOT IN THE WAY
OF SEXY TIME,

20:37.888 --> 20:39.499
WHICH WAS A BIG PROBLEM
FOR RENEE

20:39.542 --> 20:42.241
AS SHE WAS
A GCPD DETECTIVE.

20:42.284 --> 20:45.461
CRISIS OF THE HEART,
BORING, BORING, BORING.

20:45.505 --> 20:47.376
ULTIMATELY, RENEE
CALLED BATMAN,

20:47.420 --> 20:48.943
WHO CONVINCED HER
TO LURE

20:48.986 --> 20:52.729
THE LOVE OF HER LIFE
INTO HIS TRAP.

20:52.773 --> 20:55.079
RENEE: WHY WOULD SOMEONE
INFECTED WITH POISON IVY

20:55.123 --> 20:56.907
TARGET A BLACK GLOVE
OPERATIVE?

20:56.951 --> 20:59.345
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
UNLESS HE HAD

20:59.388 --> 21:01.347
A PERSONAL CONNECTION
TO THEM.

21:01.390 --> 21:02.783

I WOULD TELL YOU.

21:02.826 --> 21:04.872
WOULD YOU?

21:04.915 --> 21:06.395
BECAUSE I'M BEGINNING
TO FEEL LIKE

21:06.439 --> 21:08.484

FROM ME, RYAN.

21:10.878 --> 21:13.010

21:13.054 --> 21:15.274
MARY: THAT'S REALLY INTENSE.

21:15.317 --> 21:19.365
SO RENEE SOLD OUT
THE LOVE OF HER LIFE
TO BATMAN?

21:19.408 --> 21:22.411
AND HE BURIED HER
DEEP UNDERGROUND

21:22.455 --> 21:24.805
AWAY FROM WATER
AND SUNLIGHT

21:24.848 --> 21:28.722

AND NOT DIE.

CAN YOU IMAGINE GOING
WITHOUT SKIN CREAM

MARY'S HEARD ENOUGH.

TO SCARE HER.

21:48.394 --> 21:51.048

DOING OURSELVES A DISSERVICE

THE PREDICTABLE OUTCOME

21:53.790 --> 21:55.183

IN CONTACT

21:55.226 --> 21:56.837
WITH BATMAN'S TROPHIES.

22:01.581 --> 22:04.366
AS A GIRL WHO SPENT
OVER A DECADE
OF HER LIFE LOCKED

22:04.410 --> 22:06.412
IN A SMALL ROOM,

22:06.455 --> 22:09.676

TO AVOID ENDING UP

JUSTIFY KILLING

IT BROKE ME, RYAN,

22:18.902 --> 22:20.904

I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS ENDS

22:23.559 --> 22:26.214
AND NOT DO EVERYTHING
IN MY POWER TO STOP IT,

22:26.257 --> 22:28.434
IT WOULDN'T BE FAIR TO ME,
TO THE CITY,

WHAT MY TRIGGER IS.

OR A SERIES OF WORDS.

TO FEEL A LITTLE FUNNY.

A LITTLE BLURRY.

DEHYDRATED.

WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME
TO FIGURE THIS OUT.

23:13.174 --> 23:14.741
ALICE: WE COULD ASK SOPHIE
TO ASK VIRGIL

23:14.784 --> 23:17.352
IF HE SAID OR DID ANYTHING
THAT TRIGGERED MARY.

23:17.396 --> 23:20.355
SOPHIE'S NOT
WITH VIRGIL.

23:20.399 --> 23:23.489

23:26.317 --> 23:30.191
SO...SOPHIE HAS BEEN
A GREAT ROOMMATE.

23:30.234 --> 23:32.411

MY DISHES AWAY,

23:32.454 --> 23:34.325
SHE CLEANS MY CLOTHES
WITH THAT FABRIC SOFTENER

23:34.369 --> 23:35.979
THAT DOESN'T IRRITATE
MY SENSITIVE SKIN.

23:36.023 --> 23:40.506
ALICE, WHAT DID
YOU DO?

23:40.549 --> 23:42.725
SOPHIE REALLY WANTED TO
INTERROGATE VIRGIL,

23:42.769 --> 23:44.771
AND I DIDN'T WANT TO
KEEP SECRETS FROM MY ROOMIE.

WHERE VIRGIL IS?

24:00.917 --> 24:02.832

HAD BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS.

THAT RIGHT

INTO THAT PSYCHO HUSH.
