- Hey there!

01:38.466 --> 01:41.767
Sure is a great day
for some kayaking.

01:45.339 --> 01:47.573
Are you camping out here?

02:03.756 --> 02:07.493
- I came out here for
some peace and quiet.

12:19.338 --> 12:20.638
- Help!

12:20.640 --> 12:21.840
Help me!

12:21.842 --> 12:23.975
Somebody please help me!

14:15.788 --> 14:16.921

14:18.524 --> 14:21.426
Sure is a great
day for kayaking.

14:22.261 --> 14:23.828
Are you camping out here?

14:23.830 --> 14:25.830
- I came out here

14:25.832 --> 14:28.032
for some peace and quiet.

14:59.932 --> 15:01.065
So peaceful.

16:39.198 --> 16:40.598
- Oh! Oh!

16:51.110 --> 16:52.110
- Barney!

16:52.845 --> 16:54.645

16:54.647 --> 16:56.414
Sorry, I spilled my coffee.

16:56.416 --> 16:57.915
- I still don't have
the Hollister report.

16:57.917 --> 16:59.817
- Well, I'm working
on that right now.

16:59.819 --> 17:02.620
- I wanted that
report yesterday.

17:02.622 --> 17:03.855
- I'm sorry, Mr. pike.

17:03.857 --> 17:05.089
I've just been a
little bit behind.

17:05.090 --> 17:07.492
- I want that report
before you leave.

17:07.493 --> 17:08.526
- Yes, sir.

17:11.262 --> 17:12.262
Sorry.

17:14.266 --> 17:15.266

17:47.132 --> 17:48.299
See y'all tomorrow.

17:48.301 --> 17:51.269

17:51.271 --> 17:52.503

17:52.505 --> 17:55.173
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

17:55.175 --> 17:56.941
You have any plans after work?

17:56.943 --> 17:58.843
- No, I'm
probably just gonna go home.

17:58.845 --> 18:00.878
- Yeah, I gotta
go to the park after work.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.547
- Really?

18:02.549 --> 18:03.781
It's super cold.

18:03.783 --> 18:04.749
- Yeah, the dog's gotta go out

18:04.751 --> 18:06.084
for a walk, though.

18:29.842 --> 18:30.942
- Hi.

18:30.944 --> 18:33.711
I'm running a little late.

18:33.713 --> 18:35.346
I know.

18:35.348 --> 18:36.981
I know, I'm sorry.

18:38.083 --> 18:39.584
Well, it shouldn't
be much longer.

18:39.586 --> 18:42.887
I'll get there as soon as I can.

18:42.889 --> 18:44.122
I will.

18:44.124 --> 18:45.790
Okay.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.258
Okay.

18:47.260 --> 18:48.260
Thank you.

18:49.027 --> 18:50.027
Bye-bye.

19:35.975 --> 19:37.208
- Hey!

19:37.210 --> 19:38.576
Stupid bastard.

20:16.782 --> 20:18.683
- Charlene, I'm home.

20:20.652 --> 20:22.520
I'm so sorry I'm
late, is she okay?

20:22.522 --> 20:23.487
- She's fine.

20:23.489 --> 20:24.589
- Did you give her her medicine?

20:24.591 --> 20:27.391
- Yes, Mr. Stevens, I always do.

20:30.696 --> 20:32.330
- Here, take this.

20:33.265 --> 20:35.499
I'm sorry I'm late again.

20:37.169 --> 20:39.136
- You just need to make
sure you're here on time

20:39.138 --> 20:40.671
from now and on.

20:40.673 --> 20:41.906
This is the second time
this week you've been late

20:41.908 --> 20:43.107
getting home from work.

20:43.109 --> 20:44.475
- I know, I'm sorry.

20:44.477 --> 20:45.776
- I'm a single mother.

20:45.778 --> 20:47.411
You met my son, remember?

20:47.413 --> 20:49.013
- Yeah, Jack.

20:49.015 --> 20:50.881
- Right, and my
parents watch Jack

20:50.883 --> 20:52.984
from the time he
gets home from school

20:52.986 --> 20:55.319
until I get home from here.

20:55.321 --> 20:58.189
When you're late, I'm late.

20:58.191 --> 20:59.857
And if this happens too often,

20:59.859 --> 21:01.125
it's just gonna cause problem.

21:01.127 --> 21:03.294
- It won't happen
again, I promise.

21:03.296 --> 21:06.597
- Okay, well, good
night, Mr. Stevens.

21:16.675 --> 21:17.808
- Hi, Ellie.

21:27.619 --> 21:28.986
Sorry I'm late.

22:41.293 --> 22:43.361
I know you're in there.

22:45.263 --> 22:47.298
I know you can hear me.

22:52.104 --> 22:53.137
I love you.

22:58.343 --> 22:59.343
I love you.

24:06.311 --> 24:07.445
I love you.

25:01.633 --> 25:04.201
- You look good today, Ellie.

25:05.937 --> 25:08.672
After I give you your medicine,

25:09.774 --> 25:12.910
you're gonna have a
wonderful breakfast.

25:12.912 --> 25:16.847
I'm standing over here
mashing bananas for you.

25:16.849 --> 25:20.050
I can tell you that
you like bananas.

25:21.286 --> 25:22.753
Okay, but first,

25:23.755 --> 25:26.957
let's give you your medicine.

25:35.600 --> 25:36.600
Hey, dad.

25:39.604 --> 25:40.604
What?

25:42.107 --> 25:44.575
What's wrong? What happened?

25:48.413 --> 25:49.413
My god.

25:51.416 --> 25:52.550
No.

25:52.552 --> 25:54.118
No! No!

25:54.120 --> 25:55.819
Dad, I'm on my way.

25:58.990 --> 25:59.990
Barney.

26:01.326 --> 26:03.193
You have to come home
and take care of Ellie.

26:03.195 --> 26:05.629
I've gotta go home right now.

26:05.631 --> 26:07.298
No, I can't!

26:07.300 --> 26:08.300
It's Jack.

26:15.473 --> 26:17.274
He got hit by a car.

26:20.879 --> 26:22.513
I think he's dead!

31:24.582 --> 31:25.782
- Clara!

31:25.784 --> 31:26.984
Clara, can you
bring me my boots?

31:26.986 --> 31:30.387
Honey, can you
bring me my boots?

31:30.389 --> 31:32.589
- Floyd, Floyd what
are you yelling about out here?

31:32.591 --> 31:33.523
- Boots!

31:33.525 --> 31:35.392
Can you bring me my boo-boots?

31:35.394 --> 31:37.694
Can you bring me my boots?

31:40.131 --> 31:41.431
Oh, and my extra pair,

31:41.433 --> 31:43.267
and my extra pair of
thermal socks, too,

31:43.269 --> 31:46.737
and my extra pair of
thermal socks, too.

32:14.666 --> 32:17.567
- Do you know what I want?

32:17.569 --> 32:20.270
I wanna be treated
like I matter!

32:20.272 --> 32:22.406
I wanna be in a
room with someone

32:22.408 --> 32:25.842
who can't take their eyes of me!

32:25.844 --> 32:30.047
I want somebody who
I'm their everything.

32:30.049 --> 32:32.282
- What about what I want?

32:56.375 --> 32:59.209
I just want some
peace and quiet.

33:19.664 --> 33:20.664
Shut up.

33:21.566 --> 33:22.632
Shut up.

33:22.634 --> 33:23.734
Shut up. Shut up.

Shut up!

33:32.911 --> 33:33.911
Shut up!

33:57.035 --> 33:58.735
- Honey!

33:58.737 --> 34:00.303
Honey, come here!

34:00.305 --> 34:02.039
Honey, hurry!

34:02.041 --> 34:03.940
Honey, come here!

34:03.942 --> 34:05.375
Honey!

37:21.405 --> 37:22.606

37:22.608 --> 37:25.375
Honey, can you

37:25.377 --> 37:28.478
- Floyd, what are
you yelling about out here?

37:28.480 --> 37:29.713
- My boots!

37:29.715 --> 37:31.681
Can you bring me my boots?

37:31.683 --> 37:35.485
Oh, and my extra pair
of thermal socks, too?

37:53.137 --> 37:56.206
- I wanna be treated
like I matter.

37:57.808 --> 37:58.808
I want...

38:00.911 --> 38:03.179
I wanna be in a
room with someone

38:03.181 --> 38:06.316
who can't take their
eyes off of me.

38:06.318 --> 38:09.886
I want somebody who
I'm their everything.

38:12.323 --> 38:14.291
I want someone who appreciates

38:14.293 --> 38:17.794
the effort it takes
to look good for them.

38:17.796 --> 38:19.696
I want to be desired.

38:20.631 --> 38:22.432
I wanna feel wanted.

38:24.669 --> 38:26.903
- What about what I want?

38:34.946 --> 38:37.814
I just want some
peace and quiet.

38:44.556 --> 38:46.189
Shut up.

38:46.191 --> 38:47.191
Shut up.

38:48.993 --> 38:50.627
Shut up! Shut up!

38:50.629 --> 38:52.195

38:52.197 --> 38:53.029
Shut up!

38:53.031 --> 38:54.031
Shut up.

39:03.374 --> 39:05.241

39:05.243 --> 39:07.077
Honey, come here!

39:07.079 --> 39:08.079
Honey!

42:27.978 --> 42:29.279
- Honey, I'm home!

42:31.416 --> 42:32.749
So what's wrong with her?

42:32.751 --> 42:34.717
- Her boyfriend
broke up with her.

42:34.719 --> 42:36.319
- Which one?

42:36.321 --> 42:37.554
- Howard.

42:37.556 --> 42:40.256
- Is he the short one
with the black hair?

42:40.258 --> 42:42.992
- No, he's the tall one
with the blonde hair.

42:42.994 --> 42:44.394
- Oh.

42:44.396 --> 42:47.096
Do you mind if I
give him a call?

42:47.098 --> 42:48.531
- He's 16!

42:48.533 --> 42:49.499
- So?

42:49.501 --> 42:51.701
Momma's gotta get her groove on.

42:53.705 --> 42:55.805
- How does it feel
knowing you're gonna spend

42:55.807 --> 42:58.074
the rest of your days in jail?

43:00.111 --> 43:02.278
I bet you're wondering
what happened.

43:02.280 --> 43:04.681
Well, I'll tell you.

43:04.683 --> 43:05.715
Roy Stoner.

43:07.384 --> 43:11.788
You see, this is the name of
the man you killed last week,

43:11.790 --> 43:13.089
I'm his uncle.

43:13.924 --> 43:16.059
And I'm also his father.

43:20.832 --> 43:22.031
- I love you.

43:23.667 --> 43:25.301
- I love you, too.

43:39.350 --> 43:41.150
- You're all I want.

50:36.767 --> 50:38.434
If you want more,

50:38.436 --> 50:41.070
we'll be in the pleasure room.

51:23.113 --> 51:24.747
- Piss off!

52:08.758 --> 52:10.926
- Yeah, you like this strap.

52:10.928 --> 52:13.362
Yeah, you like it, don't you?

52:14.398 --> 52:15.398
Yeah.

52:16.099 --> 52:17.867
Yeah. Take it.

52:17.869 --> 52:19.135
- Is this the pleasure room?

52:19.137 --> 52:20.137
- Yeah.

52:23.007 --> 52:24.007
Yeah.

52:25.842 --> 52:27.143
Take it. Yeah!

54:39.976 --> 54:41.243
- Clara!

54:41.245 --> 54:43.078
Honey, can you
bring me my boots?

54:43.080 --> 54:46.148
- Floyd, what are
you yelling about out here?

54:46.150 --> 54:47.416
- My boots!

54:47.418 --> 54:49.151
Can you bring me my boots?

54:49.153 --> 54:52.955
Oh, and my extra pair
of thermal socks, too?

55:37.400 --> 55:39.134
Don't move, pervert!

55:39.136 --> 55:40.936
Goddamn peeping tom.

55:41.738 --> 55:43.005
In broad daylight no less.

55:43.007 --> 55:44.007
- No!

55:46.343 --> 55:48.544
I know them, we're friends.

55:48.546 --> 55:51.080
- Yeah, we'll see about that.

55:53.850 --> 55:54.850
- Careful.

55:58.621 --> 56:00.222
Please, don't. I...

56:07.097 --> 56:09.832
- shut up.

56:09.834 --> 56:11.367
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

56:11.369 --> 56:13.702
Shut up, shut up, shut up,
shut up, shut up, shut up!

56:13.704 --> 56:14.704
- Okay.

56:20.210 --> 56:21.910
Can you please just let me go?

56:21.912 --> 56:23.178
I'll drive out of here,

56:23.180 --> 56:24.980
and I promise you'll
never see me again.

56:24.982 --> 56:27.349
- We'll let the cops decide.

56:27.351 --> 56:28.351
Honey!

56:29.552 --> 56:31.086
Honey, come here!

56:31.821 --> 56:32.821
Honey!

56:35.625 --> 56:36.625
Honey!

56:39.562 --> 56:40.562
Clara!

56:42.365 --> 56:43.232
Get over there,

56:43.234 --> 56:44.733
get over there.
- Okay.

56:44.735 --> 56:46.402
- Get over there,
get over there!

56:46.404 --> 56:47.404
Clara!

56:48.471 --> 56:50.339
- Floyd, what is going on?

56:50.341 --> 56:51.340
- Call the cops.

56:51.342 --> 56:53.208
I caught me a peeper.

01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:33.595
- Oh!

01:00:33.597 --> 01:00:34.597
Sorry.

01:00:46.442 --> 01:00:47.442
- Asshole.

01:00:48.244 --> 01:00:49.711
- Bradley, come.

01:00:52.548 --> 01:00:54.616
- You better hope I
never see you again.

01:01:07.397 --> 01:01:09.865
- Sir, can I help you?

01:01:09.867 --> 01:01:11.099
- No, no.

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:40.749
- What the hell do you want?

01:03:40.751 --> 01:03:41.950
- I want him.

01:03:45.321 --> 01:03:46.321
- So do I.

01:03:49.892 --> 01:03:50.892
Now leave.

01:03:54.263 --> 01:03:55.831
Or I'll kill you.

01:04:08.744 --> 01:04:11.046
I bet you have a big cock.

01:04:16.686 --> 01:04:18.086
Wolf.

01:04:18.088 --> 01:04:19.988
- Yes, mistress.

01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:22.791
- This boy will be the stallion.

01:04:23.626 --> 01:04:25.493
- As you wish.

01:04:27.496 --> 01:04:28.864
- Put these on.

01:04:34.337 --> 01:04:35.337
Wolf.

01:04:36.072 --> 01:04:38.139
- Yes, mistress.

01:04:40.643 --> 01:04:42.477
- Play the game.

01:04:42.479 --> 01:04:44.112
- Yes, mistress.

01:04:44.114 --> 01:04:47.816
- And wolf, let the
stallion go first.

01:04:47.818 --> 01:04:49.851
- Yes, mistress.

01:05:01.097 --> 01:05:03.498
- Put the rag over my face.

01:05:07.970 --> 01:05:08.970
Do it.

01:05:10.139 --> 01:05:11.139
Now!

01:05:21.117 --> 01:05:22.751
- Piss off!

01:05:23.953 --> 01:05:25.153
- Don't stop!

01:05:26.589 --> 01:05:28.723
Finish what you started.

01:05:29.492 --> 01:05:30.492
Or die!

01:05:40.436 --> 01:05:43.171
- Now, the object of the game

01:05:43.173 --> 01:05:47.375
is to see which of us can
pleasure her to revival.

01:05:47.377 --> 01:05:50.578
Mistress has asked
that you go first.

01:05:52.114 --> 01:05:54.349
- I have to go to the bathroom.

01:05:54.351 --> 01:05:55.817
- Use it.

01:05:56.652 --> 01:05:58.119
She may like it.

01:06:00.189 --> 01:06:01.856
- It'll just take a minute.

01:06:01.858 --> 01:06:03.158
- No one is allowed to leave

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:06.061
without the
mistress' permission.

01:07:03.619 --> 01:07:05.653
- Mr. pike wants to know
what the progress is

01:07:05.655 --> 01:07:07.288
on the Griffith report.

01:07:07.290 --> 01:07:09.891
- Oh, I'm just about
to get started on that.

01:07:09.893 --> 01:07:11.093
- What've you been working on?

01:07:11.862 --> 01:07:12.862
Hold on.

01:07:14.163 --> 01:07:15.697
Hello.

01:07:15.699 --> 01:07:16.898
Hi, Charlene.

01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:19.501
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:07:19.503 --> 01:07:20.503
You okay?

01:07:21.203 --> 01:07:22.203
Okay.

01:07:23.239 --> 01:07:24.773
Alright, well,
I'll see you then.

01:07:24.775 --> 01:07:27.742
But if you need something,
you give me a call, okay?

01:07:27.744 --> 01:07:28.877
Alright.

01:07:28.879 --> 01:07:29.811
Alright, I'll talk to you later.

01:07:29.813 --> 01:07:30.845
Bye.

01:07:30.847 --> 01:07:32.047
- Everything okay?

01:07:32.049 --> 01:07:33.715
- Yeah, that was
my sister Charlene.

01:07:33.717 --> 01:07:35.250
She's a private practice nurse,

01:07:35.252 --> 01:07:38.153
and well, the older woman
she's been assisting with

01:07:38.155 --> 01:07:40.388
passed away this morning.

01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:42.724
My sister kind of takes
those things real hard.

01:07:42.726 --> 01:07:44.192
- Private practice nurse?

01:07:44.194 --> 01:07:45.660
- Your wife.

01:07:45.662 --> 01:07:46.995
Can I get you to help
in here a minute?

01:07:46.997 --> 01:07:47.997
- Yeah.

01:08:02.411 --> 01:08:03.244
- Shh!

01:08:03.246 --> 01:08:04.712
Shh-shh-shh-shh!

01:08:05.848 --> 01:08:08.583
This will make you feel better.

01:10:12.442 --> 01:10:13.508
- Can I help you?

01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:15.176
- We're here for the open house.

01:10:15.178 --> 01:10:17.845
- I just got here myself.

01:10:17.847 --> 01:10:20.215
You know, technically the
open house doesn't start

01:10:20.217 --> 01:10:21.783
for another hour,

01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:24.185
but come on.

01:10:36.765 --> 01:10:37.832
Here we go.

01:10:43.973 --> 01:10:45.473
- Nice.

01:10:45.475 --> 01:10:47.775
- Now this house is actually
on the national register

01:10:47.777 --> 01:10:49.577
for historic places.

01:10:49.579 --> 01:10:50.878
And it looks much like it did

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:53.848
when it was built in the 1880s.

01:10:53.850 --> 01:10:56.851
There's approximately
2,000 square feet.

01:10:56.853 --> 01:10:59.954
Four bedrooms, 2 1/2 baths.

01:10:59.956 --> 01:11:03.391
There's a full
basement and an attic.

01:11:03.393 --> 01:11:04.393
- So...

01:11:05.461 --> 01:11:08.663
This is where it all happened?

01:11:08.665 --> 01:11:10.398
- I suppose so.

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:13.901
- Doesn't it give
you the creeps?

01:11:13.903 --> 01:11:15.703
- It's just a house.

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.808
Excuse me while I
get myself situated.

01:11:20.810 --> 01:11:22.343
Feel free to look around.

01:11:22.345 --> 01:11:26.648
If you have any questions,
just let me know, okay?

01:11:42.131 --> 01:11:43.998
- Did you know her?

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.867
Thelma, I think her name is.

01:11:45.869 --> 01:11:47.568
- Thelma Myers.

01:11:47.570 --> 01:11:49.370
No, I never met her.

01:11:55.644 --> 01:11:58.913
- Has anyone lived
here since then?

01:11:58.915 --> 01:12:01.683
- No, she was the last occupant.

01:12:19.101 --> 01:12:21.402
- Have you seen the video?

01:12:21.404 --> 01:12:22.704
- Yes, I have.

01:12:24.173 --> 01:12:26.808
- What was your take on it?

01:12:26.810 --> 01:12:28.776
- It was, uh, unusual.

01:12:46.128 --> 01:12:48.496
- Has anyone else ever
died in this house?

01:12:48.498 --> 01:12:49.931
- Well, she didn't
die in the house.

01:12:49.933 --> 01:12:51.866
- She slit her own throat

01:12:51.868 --> 01:12:54.035
in the street right outside.

01:12:54.037 --> 01:12:55.670
I'd say that's close enough.

01:12:55.672 --> 01:12:56.904
- Well, it's my understanding

01:12:56.906 --> 01:12:58.539
that she had a history
of mental illness

01:12:58.541 --> 01:13:00.375
and that wasn't the first time

01:13:00.377 --> 01:13:02.910
that she'd attempted suicide.

01:13:28.937 --> 01:13:30.405
- You're one of those people
that refuse to see the truth

01:13:30.407 --> 01:13:32.774
even when it's staring
you right in the face.

01:13:32.776 --> 01:13:34.275
- The truth?

01:13:34.277 --> 01:13:36.210
- Something in this house
took control of that woman.

01:13:36.212 --> 01:13:38.112
Something in this
house killed her.

01:13:41.050 --> 01:13:42.183
- We gotta get outta here!

01:13:42.185 --> 01:13:43.451
We gotta get outta here!
- What's wrong!?

01:13:43.453 --> 01:13:46.254
- There's something
else in this house!

01:13:59.935 --> 01:14:02.904
- Is there anybody up there?

01:14:07.743 --> 01:14:09.310
- Help me.

01:14:20.422 --> 01:14:21.422
I'm here.

01:14:26.161 --> 01:14:27.161
Help me.

01:15:19.314 --> 01:15:20.314
- Oh shit.

01:15:27.322 --> 01:15:28.322
Oh shit.

01:15:28.991 --> 01:15:30.725
- Oh my god, Sarah.

01:15:30.727 --> 01:15:32.260
- I think he's dead.

01:15:32.262 --> 01:15:33.262
Shit.

01:15:38.967 --> 01:15:40.134
Shit!

01:15:40.136 --> 01:15:41.136
Run!

01:15:41.837 --> 01:15:42.837
- Hey!

01:15:53.715 --> 01:15:54.715
- Otis?

01:15:55.651 --> 01:15:57.752
Jesus, Otis, are you okay?

01:15:57.754 --> 01:15:58.754
Otis.

01:16:00.956 --> 01:16:02.223
Are you okay?

01:16:02.225 --> 01:16:03.524
- Oh, my head.

01:16:05.093 --> 01:16:06.093
Helen?

01:16:07.529 --> 01:16:09.664
What are you doing here?

01:16:11.099 --> 01:16:13.568
- This is my listing.

01:16:13.570 --> 01:16:16.537
- Helen, I fired
you this morning.

01:16:17.439 --> 01:16:20.074
You don't work for me anymore.

01:16:41.930 --> 01:16:44.498
Hey, do you know
anything about this house

01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:47.234
other than what's on
those spec sheets?

01:16:47.236 --> 01:16:50.705
I mean, have you even
walked through it?

01:16:51.673 --> 01:16:54.041
Have you been in the attic?

01:17:02.951 --> 01:17:04.819
Well, I have.

01:17:04.821 --> 01:17:06.854
And now I know.

01:17:06.856 --> 01:17:08.990
I know what I want.

01:17:08.992 --> 01:17:10.458
This house.

01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:12.293
And I'm to take care of it.

01:17:12.295 --> 01:17:15.262
And give it exactly
what it needs.

01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:26.641
- We'll get everything
figured out, alright?

01:17:26.643 --> 01:17:28.909
Don't worry about it.

01:17:28.911 --> 01:17:31.312
Look, let me call you back.

01:17:32.648 --> 01:17:36.350
- Andy.

01:17:36.352 --> 01:17:37.352
- Yeah.

01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:41.489
Well, did he respond
to the offer?

01:17:42.557 --> 01:17:45.726
Well, don't call me
back until he does.

01:17:50.766 --> 01:17:52.400
- Well, hey there.

01:17:54.369 --> 01:17:55.670
- I know we're a bit early.

01:17:55.672 --> 01:17:56.604
I hope that's okay.

01:17:56.606 --> 01:17:59.373
- Oh, no, that's perfectly fine.

01:18:02.678 --> 01:18:05.079
Now here's the basic
information of the house.

01:18:05.081 --> 01:18:08.215
But you can only learn so
much from a piece of paper.

01:18:08.217 --> 01:18:10.751
So feel free to walk
around, explore,

01:18:10.753 --> 01:18:12.153
and have a little fun.

01:18:12.155 --> 01:18:14.522
And if you have any questions,
you just let me know.

01:18:14.524 --> 01:18:16.257
- Actually, I do
have one question.

01:18:17.527 --> 01:18:18.527
- Damn it.

01:18:20.128 --> 01:18:21.429
Yeah, Harold, let
me call you back

01:18:21.431 --> 01:18:23.164
in about 10 minutes, alright?

01:18:23.166 --> 01:18:24.166
I'm busy.

01:18:25.367 --> 01:18:26.667
No, I know you do,

01:18:26.669 --> 01:18:27.902
but give me 10 minutes, okay?

01:18:27.904 --> 01:18:29.036
It can wait.

01:18:31.273 --> 01:18:33.007
I apologize.

01:18:33.009 --> 01:18:35.042
I'm a advertising sales agent,

01:18:35.044 --> 01:18:37.778
so it seems like my phone
just never stops ringing.

01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:40.414
- Believe me, I
understand completely.

01:18:40.416 --> 01:18:42.450
Now, what was your question?

01:18:42.452 --> 01:18:43.751
- Well, I was wonder...

01:18:43.753 --> 01:18:45.186
- wait, this is
the house from that

01:18:45.188 --> 01:18:46.721
weird viral video, right?

01:18:46.723 --> 01:18:49.557
Where the girl seems
to go crazy or...

01:18:49.559 --> 01:18:51.158
- yes. Yes.

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:53.527
It is, but that is in the past.

01:18:53.529 --> 01:18:55.029
- I heard she killed herself

01:18:55.031 --> 01:18:56.897
right after she stepped
out of view of the camera.

01:18:56.899 --> 01:19:00.201
- Well, perhaps that's
what she wanted.

01:19:06.808 --> 01:19:08.375
- Sorry.

01:19:08.377 --> 01:19:09.210
I'm a little early.

01:19:09.212 --> 01:19:10.411
- That's quite alright.

01:19:10.413 --> 01:19:12.246
You're not even
the first one here.

01:19:12.248 --> 01:19:14.749
This is, oh, I'm sorry.

01:19:14.751 --> 01:19:17.118
I did not even ask your names.

01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:18.152
- I'm Andy.

01:19:19.321 --> 01:19:20.788
- Hi, I'm Ellie.

01:19:22.257 --> 01:19:24.558
- So how old did you
say this house was?

01:19:27.130 --> 01:19:29.730
I'm gonna turn the
damn thing off.

01:19:29.732 --> 01:19:31.265
Shit!

01:19:31.267 --> 01:19:33.234
Sometimes I just wanna smash
this phone against the wall.

01:19:33.236 --> 01:19:35.169
- Well, it sounds
like your life choices

01:19:35.171 --> 01:19:38.939
are interfering with
who you really are.

01:19:38.941 --> 01:19:41.142
That's what life is
all about, isn't it?

01:19:41.144 --> 01:19:42.810
Finding out who you
are and what you want

01:19:42.812 --> 01:19:46.213
and then going out and
achieving whatever that is.

01:19:46.215 --> 01:19:48.582
- You make it sound so simple.

01:19:48.584 --> 01:19:50.251
- Only because it is.

01:19:50.253 --> 01:19:52.920
Oh well, unless, of course,
you don't know who you are

01:19:52.922 --> 01:19:54.455
or what you want.

01:19:57.359 --> 01:19:59.326
- Then what do you do?

01:20:00.328 --> 01:20:03.230
- Well, I can help
you with that.

01:20:04.933 --> 01:20:07.234
Let me show you the attic.
