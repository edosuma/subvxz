Don't get me wrong.

00:12.645 --> 00:13.980
{\an8}Kortni is a good friend.

00:14.047 --> 00:15.648
{\an8}But I don't want anything more.

00:15.715 --> 00:18.385
{\an8}It's not worth ruining
a friendship over.

00:18.451 --> 00:21.154

00:22.355 --> 00:24.591
{\an8}No.

00:22.355 --> 00:24.591
{\an8}He grabbed my face.

{\an7}I don't know if I see us
going forward.

00:31.231 --> 00:33.233
{\an8}I mean, it's obvious

00:33.299 --> 00:35.135
{\an8}When we hooked up,
it did mean something to me.

I hear Gus talking to someone.

02:22.609 --> 02:24.477

I had a great time
sleeping.

02:44.964 --> 02:46.332
(Gus chuckles)

02:46.399 --> 02:50.370
You literally hunched
my best friend 42 hours ago.

02:50.436 --> 02:52.472
And now you got another girl
over here?

02:52.539 --> 02:55.108
No, not today, Satan.

02:55.174 --> 02:57.644
I'm waking Nilsa up
and I'm letting her know,

02:57.710 --> 02:59.479
don't lay up with Gus again

02:59.546 --> 03:01.114
'cause he done brung

That is like kind of disgusting.

03:19.065 --> 03:21.367
{\an8}Like it was less than...

03:21.434 --> 03:24.070
{\an8}48 hours ago when we hunched.

03:24.137 --> 03:26.472
And now you're hunching
another girl?

03:26.539 --> 03:28.241
Come and get me
when you wake up.

03:28.308 --> 03:29.542

03:47.460 --> 03:49.162
Damn, it is nice

04:21.027 --> 04:22.328
So did I come home first?

04:22.395 --> 04:24.263
{\an4}Yeah.

04:22.395 --> 04:24.263
Oh, before he came home?

04:24.330 --> 04:25.665
Yeah, you and Candace did.

04:25.732 --> 04:27.000

all this together

I thought, too.

04:34.040 --> 04:35.575

17:08.026 --> 17:09.795
Oh, my bra's sandy.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.763
Now I can't put it back on.

17:11.829 --> 17:14.500
{\an8}Our friendship is unstoppable.

17:14.566 --> 17:16.568
{\an8}Like that girl is my girl.

17:16.635 --> 17:18.069
I don't feel like I could
have gotten over

17:18.137 --> 17:19.570
this Gus situation
without her.

17:19.637 --> 17:21.272
Spray it in my mouth.

17:21.339 --> 17:23.709
Aah!

17:23.776 --> 17:26.878
Aimee, hold on,
I spilled my champagne.

17:26.944 --> 17:29.581
♪♪

17:29.648 --> 17:32.551
♪ Let's have another... ♪

17:32.618 --> 17:34.386
Ah, never waste
a drop.

17:34.453 --> 17:35.454
{\an3}Bitch!

17:38.724 --> 17:41.393
{\an1}(Nilsa)
Whoo...

17:41.460 --> 17:42.761
Time out.
You all hear yellin'?

17:42.828 --> 17:44.496
Whoo...

17:44.563 --> 17:46.365
Cannonball!

17:46.432 --> 17:49.334
{\an5}You don't (bleep) scream
in my (bleep) house,
mother(bleep).

17:49.401 --> 17:50.569
(Aimee laughs)

17:50.636 --> 17:52.938
{\an1}I puked and rallied.
I threw up a whole onion.

17:53.005 --> 17:54.807
Kirk, we learned
how to surf.

17:54.873 --> 17:56.041
{\an3}(Kirk)
Do it.

18:01.213 --> 18:02.648
I am not in the mood
to deal with that.

18:02.714 --> 18:04.082
{\an5}I gotta pee.

18:02.714 --> 18:04.082
I'll tell you that right now.

18:04.149 --> 18:06.585
{\an5}(Jeremiah)
So I see Aimee and Nilsa
are in the pool,

18:06.652 --> 18:08.387
and they have
a bunch of champagne.

18:08.454 --> 18:10.122
{\an8}I'm gonna go put
my swimming trunks on.

18:10.189 --> 18:13.192
{\an5}Cannonball!

18:10.189 --> 18:13.192
{\an3}Whoo!

18:13.258 --> 18:15.928
(excited screaming, shouting)

18:15.994 --> 18:17.296
(Nilsa)
See what I mean?!

18:21.099 --> 18:22.100
(groans)
Ohh...

18:22.167 --> 18:23.168
(whimpers)

18:25.437 --> 18:27.573
{\an5}I feel awful.

18:25.437 --> 18:27.573
{\an1}Why?

18:27.639 --> 18:29.408
I'm just depressed
about Gator.

18:29.475 --> 18:31.410
I don't wanna hurt him.

18:31.477 --> 18:33.178
(Candace)
I feel so bad,

18:33.245 --> 18:34.980
but I just don't see it
going nowhere.

18:35.047 --> 18:37.549
Like we don't
even talk like that.

18:37.616 --> 18:40.052
So, with that being said,
I'm just kinda to the point

18:40.118 --> 18:42.421
where I'm like,
you know what,

18:42.488 --> 18:44.423
it's better to go ahead
and end it.

18:44.490 --> 18:48.260
'Cause at one point,
Gator did make me happy.

18:48.327 --> 18:50.128
At one point, like
you may be happy,

18:50.195 --> 18:53.131
{\an1}but he ended up
being a (bleep) psychopath.

18:53.198 --> 18:54.533
You can't help that.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.134
{\an1}You feel like
you deserve better,

18:56.201 --> 18:57.436
which you do.

18:57.503 --> 19:00.572
{\an8}I'm here for moral support.

19:00.639 --> 19:03.308
{\an8}If you break up with Gator...

19:03.375 --> 19:05.577
If you don't...

19:05.644 --> 19:08.747
If you decide
to cheat on him...

19:08.814 --> 19:10.983
It's whatever you want, girl.

19:11.049 --> 19:13.552
I will clap for you
and I will support you, Candace.

19:13.619 --> 19:16.688
{\an1}Everything is happening
for a reason.

19:16.755 --> 19:18.390
{\an1}And God loves you.
Your mama loves you.

19:18.457 --> 19:20.692
{\an1}I love you.
Your family loves you.

19:20.759 --> 19:22.394
I love you.

19:22.461 --> 19:24.763
And if you ever need
a prayer, I'm here.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.031
{\an3}Thank you.

19:26.098 --> 19:27.332
(Candace)
I appreciate Kortni's advice,

19:27.399 --> 19:29.067
but I'm tired
of talking about it.

19:29.134 --> 19:31.403
{\an8}I'm tired of being sad
and lonely and upset

19:31.470 --> 19:33.272
{\an8}about my failed relationship.

19:33.338 --> 19:34.673
{\an8}It's time for me to go ahead
and end it

19:34.740 --> 19:36.074
{\an8}and stop crying about it.

19:36.141 --> 19:37.409
Ooh, I'm stressed out.

19:37.476 --> 19:39.344
{\an1}I don't want to have
to make this phone call.

19:39.411 --> 19:41.513
(line ringing)

19:47.286 --> 19:49.054
{\an7}So...

19:49.121 --> 19:52.124
{\an8}I haven't heard from you...

19:52.190 --> 19:53.559
{\an8}since how long?

19:55.594 --> 19:57.829
It looks a certain
type of way to me.

19:57.896 --> 20:00.098
{\an1}And now I've come
to a conclusion

20:00.165 --> 20:02.034
{\an1}that I don't even think that
we should be together no more.

20:15.414 --> 20:17.349
It looks a certain
type of way to me,

20:17.416 --> 20:19.718
{\an1}and now I've come
to a conclusion

20:19.785 --> 20:21.853
{\an1}that I don't even think that
we should be together no more.

20:32.264 --> 20:33.865
{\an9}Okay.

20:33.932 --> 20:34.967
{\an3}Okay.

20:37.903 --> 20:40.439
{\an8}Okay, I-- I understand.

20:40.505 --> 20:42.107
{\an8}I love you and I care
about you too,

20:42.174 --> 20:43.976
{\an8}but I don't think that
the relationship is gonna work.

20:44.042 --> 20:45.410
{\an9}I don't.

20:47.412 --> 20:48.647
{\an8}Because it's just...

20:48.714 --> 20:50.048
{\an8}Yeah, that's exactly
how I feel,

20:50.115 --> 20:51.350
{\an8}and it's how
I've been feeling.

20:58.690 --> 21:00.125
All right.

21:00.192 --> 21:01.593
Have a good night.

21:04.696 --> 21:05.831
{\an8}Bye.

21:08.834 --> 21:10.802
So what happened?

21:10.869 --> 21:13.105
It's like the worst.

21:13.171 --> 21:15.941
{\an8}I don't like being responsible
for other people's pain.

21:16.008 --> 21:17.643
(crying, muttering)

21:17.709 --> 21:20.245
(voice breaking)
That was a real hard phone call.

21:20.312 --> 21:22.247
I feel like
a (bleep) person.

21:22.314 --> 21:24.750
You can't make yourself
wanna be with somebody.

21:24.816 --> 21:26.551
Honestly don't know
if like if I can see

21:26.618 --> 21:28.453
a future with him,
you know what I'm saying?

21:28.520 --> 21:31.323
Like he wanna build
this certain life.

21:31.390 --> 21:34.326
And it's just my direction
where I'm going,

21:34.393 --> 21:36.328
{\an1}I don't think it's gonna
be the same where he going.

21:36.395 --> 21:37.963
I know for a fact it's not.

21:38.030 --> 21:39.398
{\an1}It'll all get
better with time.

21:39.464 --> 21:41.867
You'll feel better with time,
he'll get over it with time.

21:41.933 --> 21:44.569
{\an1}I hate I had to break
somebody's heart like that.

21:44.636 --> 21:47.105
It hurts and it's gonna hurt
for right now.

21:47.172 --> 21:49.541
I'ma cry about it
for a couple of days.

21:49.608 --> 21:51.510
And...

21:51.576 --> 21:55.681
And now I can see like
what else is out there

21:55.747 --> 21:57.215
that's better for me.

(Karrie)
Good morning!

24:26.665 --> 24:27.666
You got me that?

24:27.732 --> 24:29.067
This is the special one.

24:29.134 --> 24:30.135
{\an6}Uh-huh.

24:29.134 --> 24:30.135
{\an1}All right?

24:30.202 --> 24:31.236
This is my favorite bandana

24:31.303 --> 24:33.205
{\an1}that I only wear
on special occasions.

24:33.271 --> 24:35.040
{\an6}Okay.

24:33.271 --> 24:35.040
Since it's bike week,

24:35.106 --> 24:36.341
{\an1}I figured that
you would wear it.

24:36.408 --> 24:38.510
Okay. I'm gonna
wear it now?

24:38.577 --> 24:40.478
{\an4}You can.

24:38.577 --> 24:40.478
{\an3}Okay.

24:40.545 --> 24:41.780
You have to tie it
for me.

24:41.847 --> 24:43.582
{\an5}(Codi)
So, normal place
that you'd work,

24:43.648 --> 24:44.783
you know, you start
at the bottom

24:44.850 --> 24:46.418
{\an8}and you work your way up.

24:46.484 --> 24:49.621
So you start out,
then you become, like, manager,

24:49.688 --> 24:52.657
then like owner,
then like CEO.

24:52.724 --> 24:53.959
Well, here at Shore Dogs,

24:54.025 --> 24:57.162
you know, you reach
cutoff sleeve status.

24:57.229 --> 24:59.030
{\an5}There you go.

24:57.229 --> 24:59.030
{\an3}Hell yeah.

24:59.097 --> 25:00.765
{\an5}(Codi)
I've already reached
cutoff sleeve status.

25:00.832 --> 25:02.434
Now I've reached
bandana status.

25:02.500 --> 25:05.237
So that's pretty much like
administration level.

25:05.303 --> 25:07.806
{\an5}(Kevin)
Doesn't he look sexy
with that bandana on now?

25:07.873 --> 25:09.274
It makes the outfit now.

25:09.341 --> 25:10.542
{\an5}(Jeremiah)
It actually does
bring it all together.

25:10.609 --> 25:13.278
It brings it all together.
Codi to biker.

25:16.948 --> 25:18.516
Damn...

25:21.353 --> 25:22.821

a look she just gave you.

25:22.888 --> 25:23.889

Down here?
Oh, my God, yeah.

25:38.637 --> 25:40.739
(Kortni)
Bike week is huge.

25:40.805 --> 25:44.809
This is like spring break for
adults that have motorcycles.

25:44.876 --> 25:46.044
Oh, my gosh.

25:46.111 --> 25:47.445
{\an1}That's what you're
gonna be coming into.

25:47.512 --> 25:50.181
It's just gonna be insanity
for you guys to go anywhere.

25:50.248 --> 25:52.884
{\an5}You can barely walk,
'cause there's bikes
that are just bikes,

25:52.951 --> 25:55.921
{\an5}like back to back,
like rows and rows
and rows and rows.

25:55.987 --> 25:57.088
Like, Benders...

25:57.155 --> 25:58.456
(Codi)
What are we gonna do?

25:58.523 --> 26:00.158
Where are we gonna
go out and drink and stuff?

26:00.225 --> 26:01.960
Get a keg and sit

26:03.094 --> 26:04.796
I just don't go nowhere.

It's kind of hard just throw us
into a bar full of bikers

26:06.765 --> 26:09.234
when we all dress
completely different.

26:09.301 --> 26:11.169
We don't have chaps on
and leather.

26:11.236 --> 26:13.605

26:11.236 --> 26:13.605
Yeah.

26:13.672 --> 26:15.874
{\an1}I mean, I pop my collar,
short shorts.

26:15.941 --> 26:17.242
You know, boat shoes.

26:17.309 --> 26:19.244
And I'm dressed like
the new pledge, you know.

26:19.311 --> 26:22.514
{\an8}I wear palm trees
with pink colors, all right?

26:22.580 --> 26:25.617

I don't really shower
the whole week.

{\an1}I just stay out
on the beach,

26:30.055 --> 26:32.590
{\an1}and then I brush my hair out
on Sunday when everyone leaves.

it sounds like.

The only phrases you guys
need to know

29:18.123 --> 29:19.958
is,<i> "Por favor,</i>
<i>dame una margarita."</i>

29:20.024 --> 29:21.793
That means,
"Please give me a margarita."

29:21.860 --> 29:25.330
Okay, so some of my favorite
Spanish phrases are,

29:25.396 --> 29:26.631
<i>"¿Dónde está el baño?"</i>

29:26.698 --> 29:28.233
Because that just rolls
right off the tongue.

29:28.299 --> 29:29.801
That means,
"Where is the bathroom?"

29:29.868 --> 29:31.469
<i>Hola.</i>

29:31.536 --> 29:32.537
That means hello.

29:32.604 --> 29:35.073
(bleep)<i> madre</i> (bleep).

29:35.140 --> 29:37.642
<i>Cerveza.</i>
That means beer.

29:37.709 --> 29:39.577
I think it means like,
"(bleep) your mother, bitch."

29:39.644 --> 29:40.678
I'm not sure.

29:40.745 --> 29:42.614
So I think cognac is French,

29:42.680 --> 29:44.616
so I'm hoping that cognac
is the same in English

29:44.682 --> 29:48.386
as it is in Spanish,
so I think I should be good.

29:48.453 --> 29:50.755
<i>¡Parrrra!</i>

29:50.822 --> 29:53.458
<i>¿Te gusta mi palmas?</i>

my palm trees?"
