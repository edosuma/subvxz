WEBVTT

00:23.483 --> 00:29.072
Beloved countrymen, the New Liberalism
party is the only force in Colombia

00:29.155 --> 00:31.616
that is not afraid of narcotraffickers.

00:31.700 --> 00:34.577
"There are three ways
the narcotraffickers...

00:35.704 --> 00:39.332
- try to weaken extradition."
- ...try to weaken extradition.

00:39.416 --> 00:40.667
- "Bribery..."
- Bribery...

00:40.750 --> 00:44.754
- "...intimidation through violence..."
- ...intimidation through violence...

00:44.838 --> 00:46.923
- "...and extortion."
- ...and extortion!

00:48.133 --> 00:52.262
- "A dark and terrible scourge."
- A dark and terrible scourge.

00:52.345 --> 00:53.555
What are you doing?

00:54.472 --> 00:56.766
Just making sure he gets it right.

00:58.727 --> 01:01.312
You wrote it, you should know.

01:05.525 --> 01:07.026
Look, I brought you this.

01:07.610 --> 01:09.028
What's this?

01:09.112 --> 01:13.825
Clean socks.
Your wife dropped them off before we left.

01:16.077 --> 01:17.328
How's Galén doing?

01:18.705 --> 01:19.914
All right.

01:20.874 --> 01:24.377
I wish he didn't focus so much
on extradition of narcos.

01:25.420 --> 01:27.255
There are other things to mention.

01:28.465 --> 01:30.008
Galén's got some balls.

01:31.050 --> 01:34.679
Brave men have a way of dying.

01:34.763 --> 01:36.848
Well, then...

01:36.931 --> 01:40.643
you don't have to worry... do you?

01:45.940 --> 01:47.150
Pass me the socks.

03:59.866 --> 04:01.868
Do you sleep with all your informants?

04:05.204 --> 04:06.998
I'm not your responsibility.

04:11.586 --> 04:15.548
If Pablo Escobar finds you...
he'll kill you in a heartbeat.

04:18.843 --> 04:20.553
Not if I kill him first.

07:46.509 --> 07:47.593
Look at this shit.

07:47.677 --> 07:54.225
We are spending millions of dollars...
and can't even get a decent meal anywhere.

07:54.308 --> 07:59.230
Listen... the problem isn't the food,
the problem is Noriega.

07:59.981 --> 08:03.568
First chance he gets,
he'll sell us to the Americans.

08:03.651 --> 08:05.153
You guys stay calm.

08:05.236 --> 08:07.071
Once we reach an agreement
with the government,

08:07.155 --> 08:08.531
we will be back in our homeland.

08:08.614 --> 08:12.743
Pay the Colombian national debt
for amnesty?

08:13.452 --> 08:15.872
I'd rather go live in Spain.

08:15.955 --> 08:20.418
I say we go back and fight.

08:20.501 --> 08:23.588
No, sir, none of that.
War is bad for business.

08:23.671 --> 08:25.965
We will negotiate with them
as Pablo agreed.

08:31.846 --> 08:32.847
Let's see, Gustavo.

08:33.472 --> 08:34.724
None of this would've happened

08:34.807 --> 08:36.934
if he hadn't started
killing politicians and judges.

08:37.018 --> 08:39.270
Tell me what we are supposed to do, then.

08:39.353 --> 08:42.064
Do you want to sit here
and cry over spilled milk?

08:43.191 --> 08:44.317
You know something, Pablo?

08:46.527 --> 08:50.698
Sometimes, I think you kill these men
because they won't let you in their club.

08:50.781 --> 08:53.576
You better watch your mouth, asshole.

09:11.719 --> 09:15.473
The Colombian government
has refused our amnesty offer.

09:17.558 --> 09:20.311
Get used to the food, gentlemen.

09:22.438 --> 09:24.315
It's not safe to go back home.

09:47.797 --> 09:50.299
They've rejected our amnesty deal.

09:53.552 --> 09:55.513
We may have to stay.

10:00.142 --> 10:01.727
I hate this place.

10:04.855 --> 10:07.024
We can go someplace else.

10:07.108 --> 10:08.776
I hear Switzerland is very beautiful.

10:10.695 --> 10:12.697
In Switzerland, we are nobody, Pablo.

10:14.031 --> 10:17.451
What good is having all the money
in the world if you can't go home?

10:25.376 --> 10:29.297
If we go back...
I'm going to have to fight.

10:37.638 --> 10:39.974
Do whatever is necessary, my love.

11:02.621 --> 11:04.749
You're way ahead in the polls.

11:05.875 --> 11:07.960
In my opinion, the outcome is decided.

11:09.003 --> 11:12.256
My question is... why do you keep
getting involved with the narcos?

11:13.507 --> 11:15.092
I want a country at peace.

11:16.427 --> 11:18.179
And if I don't do it, Who Will?

11:19.055 --> 11:20.681
You're pushing them into a corner.

11:22.058 --> 11:23.642
I'm wearing a vest.

11:24.977 --> 11:27.104
I'm afraid that a bulletproof vest...

11:27.188 --> 11:30.316
isn't enough to ensure
that you have a future.

11:32.860 --> 11:36.322
Don't worry, my friend.
There will be a future.

12:42.972 --> 12:44.723
Let's speak clearly, brother.

12:48.060 --> 12:49.645
Galén's dead.

12:50.563 --> 12:52.106
You had him killed, didn't you?

12:53.399 --> 12:55.734
You didn't tell us shit,
and you killed him, you son of a bitch.

12:55.818 --> 12:58.529
- I want to go home, Fabio.
- Home?

12:58.612 --> 13:01.157
Why are we going home?
So they can capture us?

13:02.992 --> 13:06.912
All this shit you like to talk about our
partnership, and then this on your own?

13:13.586 --> 13:16.213
Galén was the only threat.

13:17.047 --> 13:19.258
There is no one left to challenge us.

13:20.134 --> 13:21.552
And you know why, Fabio.

13:22.511 --> 13:25.556
Because no one has the balls that we have.

13:29.393 --> 13:30.478
Going home.

13:42.072 --> 13:44.533
That unique honesty.

13:44.617 --> 13:47.703
The village stands up
and calls for justice.

13:47.786 --> 13:51.749
I pray to God...
that this sacrifice will serve at last...

13:53.167 --> 13:59.423
for society to react... and bond...
to support the government...

14:00.799 --> 14:02.343
and institutions...

14:03.302 --> 14:07.056
but also...
demanding a more effective work...

14:07.973 --> 14:14.730
undeterred by the hitman and hijacking
or any other manifestation of violence.

14:15.689 --> 14:18.776
My father, Luis Carlos Galén,

14:18.859 --> 14:21.111
will be remembered
for awakening the Colombian people

14:21.195 --> 14:24.323
to the danger of the narcos.

14:26.242 --> 14:30.579
The assassin's bullets...
will not stop what my father began.

14:31.497 --> 14:35.042
As he fell, another rises in his place.

14:35.751 --> 14:39.588
I want to tell Dr. César Gaviria...

14:40.714 --> 14:43.676
in the name of the people and my family...

14:44.635 --> 14:47.513
that we entrust my father's ideals to him,

14:47.596 --> 14:49.431
and that he can count on our support...

14:50.015 --> 14:53.644
to become the president
Colombia wants and needs.

14:56.605 --> 15:00.651
Dr. César Gaviria, save Colombia!

15:33.809 --> 15:35.144
Phone!

15:37.021 --> 15:38.939
Let it go to the answering machine.

15:43.110 --> 15:44.320
The machine's full.

15:47.573 --> 15:49.783
I wish it would stop ringing.

15:49.867 --> 15:51.327
It's your friends.

15:51.410 --> 15:52.995
They're calling to offer support.

15:55.039 --> 15:58.417
Or opinions about what I should do.

16:00.419 --> 16:02.671
Why can't you run
without backing extradition?

16:07.843 --> 16:10.971
- I wrote those speeches.
- Yes...

16:12.222 --> 16:13.724
but do you even believe them?

16:17.394 --> 16:19.313
I don't know what I believe.

16:20.981 --> 16:23.734
I don't want the narcos having free reign.

16:25.527 --> 16:28.947
But I don't want the United States
involved in our affairs.

16:29.990 --> 16:31.742
So say nothing.

16:33.577 --> 16:35.871
That's the best way to stay alive.

16:52.179 --> 16:53.222
Gentlemen.

16:54.223 --> 16:57.810
Fernando, cheer up. Have a drink.

16:57.893 --> 16:59.770
We're going home!

17:04.608 --> 17:07.111
- How are you?
- Fine, my love.

17:09.029 --> 17:10.614
What about you?

17:10.698 --> 17:11.740
Give me one.

17:13.992 --> 17:15.244
Margarita, right?

17:16.120 --> 17:17.287
Let's see.

17:19.456 --> 17:21.458
- Son of a bitch, that's good.
- Right.

17:21.542 --> 17:22.418
Thank you.

17:23.168 --> 17:25.421
Listen, I've got a question for you.

17:25.504 --> 17:27.631
Why are we going back?

17:28.549 --> 17:30.259
We're walking into a world of shit.

17:31.093 --> 17:34.221
Relax, brother.

17:34.304 --> 17:38.058
Spain's too far away
to protect our interests.

17:38.892 --> 17:42.396
We have a better chance
of influencing Pablo at home.

17:42.479 --> 17:47.025
We need to be close by. Relax.

17:47.860 --> 17:49.987
Don't you get it?

17:52.990 --> 17:55.284
He's only comfortable at war.

17:55.367 --> 17:57.745
He's taking us to the slaughter.

18:25.981 --> 18:27.441
How's business?

18:27.524 --> 18:33.071
Fucking Noriega is charging us a fortune,
but we got 175 tons to Miami.

18:33.864 --> 18:37.451
Gacha's Mexican routes
are opening up Los Angeles.

18:38.952 --> 18:42.080
But do you know what matters most
for our business, Pablo?

18:43.248 --> 18:47.002
That the situation at home stays calm.

18:47.085 --> 18:48.337
OK.

19:03.185 --> 19:05.896
You should have consulted me about Galén.

19:07.105 --> 19:09.858
You would have tried to talk me out of it.

19:13.904 --> 19:15.239
I would have tried.

19:17.825 --> 19:20.744
The amount of money we are losing
is due to that bullshit.

19:24.623 --> 19:25.958
Are you listening?

19:27.167 --> 19:28.710
Look at those peaks, Gustavo.

19:35.175 --> 19:39.179
I'll die...
before I ever leave Colombia again.

19:47.062 --> 19:48.230
What's happening, Carrillo?

19:51.900 --> 19:53.402
So you practice your English with me?

20:53.420 --> 20:54.755
Yes.

20:54.838 --> 20:56.924
I definitely like the red one best.

20:57.758 --> 20:59.009
Truly?

21:00.260 --> 21:01.678
I prefer the gray.

21:02.679 --> 21:05.432
Red is the color of the party,

21:05.515 --> 21:09.311
and it makes you more...
sociable and close to the people.

21:09.394 --> 21:10.812
And that's important.

21:14.358 --> 21:16.818
I wonder what Luis Carlos
would have chosen?

21:18.528 --> 21:21.740
You know, we should
also hire an image consultant.

21:22.658 --> 21:28.538
We have to make you more appealing
to the youth with a new look.

21:28.622 --> 21:30.624
Now you are going to give me image advice?

21:30.707 --> 21:32.542
I'm just thinking about the polls.

21:34.252 --> 21:39.925
Anyway...
Galén had professionals at his side,

21:40.008 --> 21:42.010
but which could he trust?

21:44.346 --> 21:47.474
And you know well
that you can trust me, right?

21:51.186 --> 21:54.064
Well, what are you going to choose,
red or gray?

22:02.781 --> 22:05.617
Luis Carlos said something to me
before he died.

22:07.494 --> 22:08.870
"There will be a future."

22:12.499 --> 22:14.543
Now let's see what kind of future it is.

22:21.466 --> 22:23.385
We worked together in the ministry.

22:23.468 --> 22:28.265
The idea he's a presidential candidate
shows you our sad state of affairs.

22:29.683 --> 22:31.852
I need to know which side he is on.

22:33.186 --> 22:35.981
He speaks with
the Foreign Press next week.

22:36.064 --> 22:38.025
They'll certainly ask his position.

22:38.108 --> 22:39.526
Don't worry, Pablo.

22:39.609 --> 22:40.819
He'll be easy to influence.

22:40.902 --> 22:42.362
- No, I disagree.
- Why?

22:42.446 --> 22:46.199
I did an interview with him once,
when he was an economic adviser.

22:46.283 --> 22:49.786
I found him sitting in the parking lot
in his beat-up Renault,

22:49.870 --> 22:55.375
eating a bag of apples...
and reading economic reform textbooks.

22:55.459 --> 22:58.295
He was testifying to the cabinet
and wanted to be ready.

22:58.378 --> 23:01.631
He's a bookworm, not a leader.

23:01.715 --> 23:04.593
- No-- No--
- No, you're missing my point.

23:04.676 --> 23:06.053
He's not an oligarch.

23:07.345 --> 23:09.139
He's from modest circumstances.

23:09.222 --> 23:11.141
Like you,
he's worked for everything he has.

23:12.350 --> 23:14.603
You have to be careful
of people like that.

23:23.904 --> 23:25.822
I want you to deliver a message.

23:27.407 --> 23:29.493
We've made a lot of money.

23:29.576 --> 23:35.040
What we have to decide is do we stick
with Pablo... or chart our own course?

23:38.043 --> 23:40.337
We should talk to our friends down south.

23:40.420 --> 23:44.216
No, no. It's not time. No.

23:45.801 --> 23:47.052
Whatever you say.

23:47.969 --> 23:49.554
Have you seen Marina?

23:49.638 --> 23:51.223
She told me she was going
to buy a new brush.

23:51.306 --> 23:54.059
You know your sister.

23:54.142 --> 23:56.978
Her shopping expeditions take weeks.

24:04.820 --> 24:07.948
You don't have any idea how much
I wanted to go down on you in Panama.

24:08.698 --> 24:12.119
It seems to be you really wanted to.

24:12.202 --> 24:14.704
- Come here, baby.
- You are very patient.

24:14.788 --> 24:16.081
Yes, of course.

24:17.124 --> 24:20.043
All your people were there,
your brothers...

24:28.510 --> 24:31.263
My brothers are driving me crazy.

24:34.224 --> 24:35.350
- You know what?
- What?

24:35.433 --> 24:37.477
They can go fuck themselves.

24:38.019 --> 24:39.896
If they want to,
they can go live in Spain...

24:40.689 --> 24:42.858
but you're staying here with me.

24:50.782 --> 24:52.450
Let's not hide anymore.

24:53.076 --> 24:54.536
Not anymore.

24:56.663 --> 24:57.789
All right.

24:59.791 --> 25:01.793
What do we do about my wife?

25:05.755 --> 25:07.549
Ask Pablo to do us a favor.

25:08.884 --> 25:12.220
Just like he took care of Galén,
he can take care of your wife.

25:20.520 --> 25:21.980
You...

25:22.814 --> 25:25.192
are very evil for such a young girl.

25:30.405 --> 25:32.032
You've moved up, Fernando.

25:34.576 --> 25:39.998
From government minister
to Pablo Escobar's errand boy.

25:41.666 --> 25:44.127
I guess the pay is much better.

25:44.920 --> 25:46.796
I'm not doing this for the money.

25:47.839 --> 25:52.427
What country sends its own citizens
to an iron tomb in the United States?

25:53.345 --> 25:55.013
I understand your dilemma.

25:55.096 --> 26:00.977
Speak out in favor... you're seen as a US
puppet and you might not win the election.

26:02.103 --> 26:05.482
Speak out against, you anger the US...

26:06.524 --> 26:09.527
and are criticized by our media
as a shill of the narcos.

26:09.611 --> 26:13.114
César, I was thinking I would love
to dedicate a program for your campaign.

26:13.198 --> 26:17.035
It would be an honor for me,
and would benefit us both.

26:19.120 --> 26:20.497
What a great idea.

26:21.331 --> 26:24.000
You guys are really shameless, aren't you?

26:25.252 --> 26:26.670
How do you sleep at night?

26:26.753 --> 26:28.964
César, it doesn't have to be this way.

26:29.047 --> 26:32.884
If Luis had been as smart as you,

26:32.968 --> 26:35.095
perhaps we could have
avoided this horrible tragedy.

26:37.806 --> 26:39.057
We could have had peace.

26:39.140 --> 26:40.433
Easy.

26:45.438 --> 26:46.606
Get out.

26:47.857 --> 26:49.442
Read Pablo's letter.

26:50.902 --> 26:52.862
Maybe you will have a future.

28:52.899 --> 28:54.275
Cousin, what happened?

28:55.652 --> 28:56.945
Where were you?

28:58.113 --> 28:59.739
- In the office.
- In the office?

28:59.823 --> 29:00.949
Yes.

29:01.783 --> 29:03.284
Is that where you were?

29:06.830 --> 29:08.039
That's weird...

29:09.290 --> 29:12.669
because I called
and they said you hadn't been in all clay.

29:12.752 --> 29:16.172
I don't know which office you called,
but I was there.

29:16.840 --> 29:19.175
They're seizing everything, Pablo.
All the accounts--

29:19.259 --> 29:23.179
We knew there would
be a reaction with Galén, right?

29:24.097 --> 29:25.765
Relax, Gustavo.

29:27.267 --> 29:30.103
Relax, because everything
will calm down later.

29:40.238 --> 29:42.907
What are you going to do?
Are you going to kill us both?

29:42.991 --> 29:46.119
- You afraid to die?
- No. And you?

29:54.419 --> 29:56.921
- Put it out.
- Where were you?

29:57.714 --> 29:58.798
Put it out, Pablo.

30:00.383 --> 30:01.759
Put it out, Pablo!

30:10.727 --> 30:12.020
Are you with me or what?

30:14.814 --> 30:16.691
And when have I not been with you?

30:20.737 --> 30:23.698
From the beginning,
it has been you and me.

30:26.576 --> 30:29.120
I cannot do this without you.

30:33.500 --> 30:35.919
You're doubting my loyalty, Pablo?

30:38.796 --> 30:40.131
No.

30:43.218 --> 30:46.846
But I'm having serious doubts
with the Ochoas.

32:19.272 --> 32:20.815
Time to thin the herd.

32:24.235 --> 32:25.486
But did we score a goal?

32:26.404 --> 32:28.114
The reporter, right.

32:30.450 --> 32:32.744
Let's make sure
we score a goal on him as well.

32:36.080 --> 32:36.914
Come on, come on.

33:01.356 --> 33:04.025
You are aware
that I can end your military career?

33:04.901 --> 33:06.653
I don't give a fuck.

33:06.736 --> 33:09.656
Horacio... don't give up.

33:10.531 --> 33:14.327
You've always been the leader
of the persecution of Pablo Escobar.

33:14.410 --> 33:16.412
Is this how you show your appreciation
for all we've done?

33:16.496 --> 33:18.539
This operation
could be a failure before it starts.

33:18.623 --> 33:20.958
I'm not here for fun.

33:21.042 --> 33:22.627
What happens is the defense minister

33:22.710 --> 33:26.130
gives you credit for the evidence
that we found at Hacienda Népoles.

33:26.214 --> 33:30.385
So... then if you resign,
I will look really bad.

33:30.468 --> 33:32.470
Is that why you're doing that?
Is that what you want?

33:32.553 --> 33:36.516
Horacio... you remember when were cadets,

33:36.599 --> 33:39.477
we never thought they would call us
to lead the country's most important unit.

33:40.311 --> 33:43.398
Horacio, <i>as</i> your friend...
I'm asking you to think about it.

33:43.481 --> 33:46.025
Rodrigo, I don't even know who Pablo pays.

33:46.859 --> 33:48.403
It could be any of us three.

33:49.278 --> 33:50.488
Horacio, please.

33:50.571 --> 33:53.157
I've put my family at risk.

33:53.241 --> 33:56.786
I need the right tools...
if there is going to be a war.

33:58.121 --> 33:59.747
All right.

33:59.831 --> 34:01.082
Perfect.

34:02.667 --> 34:04.210
Then tell me what you need.

34:06.504 --> 34:08.172
Incorruptible men.

34:33.990 --> 34:36.868
Hey, punk. Are you all right?

34:36.951 --> 34:39.036
- Sure.
- Come here.

35:07.440 --> 35:09.275
How are you, son?

35:10.443 --> 35:12.570
How are you?

35:31.214 --> 35:32.882
I have to kill that son of a bitch.

35:35.384 --> 35:39.889
Carrillo's a cop.
You can always buy a cop with money.

35:39.972 --> 35:41.849
I've tried, believe me.

35:41.933 --> 35:43.434
Then offer more.

35:44.101 --> 35:48.981
Or I can loan you Navegante.
He will do whatever I ask.

35:52.902 --> 35:53.986
That's true.

35:55.071 --> 36:00.368
It's silver or lead.
That's the choice for that bastard.

36:00.451 --> 36:05.456
Speaking of lead,
I'm getting a shipment of weapons in.

36:05.540 --> 36:07.375
Uzis, grenades...

36:07.458 --> 36:13.381
If I could find a nuclear weapon...
But now I'm negotiating a fucking missile.

36:13.464 --> 36:16.551
- A missile? No fucking way.
- Yes.

36:16.634 --> 36:17.927
Boss.

36:33.025 --> 36:34.527
He's bullshitting, right?

36:34.610 --> 36:38.906
He's smoking that shit...
I guarantee it.

36:41.492 --> 36:43.160
Motherfucker.

36:52.336 --> 36:56.173
Mrs. Quiroga told me
the neighbors on the block took a vote.

36:57.133 --> 36:58.301
They want us to move.

36:58.384 --> 37:02.847
But we have guards stationed
outside the house 24 hours a day.

37:02.930 --> 37:04.473
That's what scares them.

37:08.019 --> 37:09.103
Come here.

37:11.522 --> 37:13.441
It won't always be so, my love.

37:38.841 --> 37:40.509
- Rodrigo.
- Hello, Horacio.

37:40.593 --> 37:42.470
- Everything good?
- May I speak to you?

37:42.553 --> 37:44.138
Yes, sure. Come in.

37:45.932 --> 37:47.725
Let's talk about the incorruptibles.

37:49.644 --> 37:50.895
I'm listening.

37:58.235 --> 38:02.281
I've been instructed to tell you that
if you cease and desist your operations,

38:02.365 --> 38:05.868
you will receive
a one-time payment of six million.

38:07.078 --> 38:09.705
Horacio... that's US dollars, not pesos.

38:12.458 --> 38:14.126
Instructed by whom?

38:16.087 --> 38:18.005
I think you can guess.

38:20.216 --> 38:21.384
Say the name.

38:21.467 --> 38:23.177
You know who.

38:24.595 --> 38:25.846
Say the name, Rodrigo.

38:30.601 --> 38:31.811
Escobar.

38:37.525 --> 38:39.110
Don't look at me like that, Horacio.

38:39.193 --> 38:41.529
I've always cared for you.

38:41.612 --> 38:45.908
I'm making this suggestion to save
you and your family from terrible grief.

38:48.744 --> 38:50.413
This man has tentacles.

38:50.496 --> 38:53.332
I'm surprised
he hasn't killed you already.

38:55.251 --> 38:56.377
Get out.

38:58.671 --> 39:00.256
Horacio, please--

39:08.764 --> 39:09.890
Horacio...

39:18.649 --> 39:19.900
Take care.

40:55.246 --> 40:57.623
It was about time, Navegante.

44:47.978 --> 44:49.897
Finally, a romantic date.

44:51.106 --> 44:53.150
It's been a long time
since we've been alone.

44:53.942 --> 44:57.696
Just you, me...
and our bodyguard.

45:01.033 --> 45:04.995
Like the old days when we were young
and your father watched us.

45:06.038 --> 45:08.665
- My father adored you.
- Yeah, right.

45:28.602 --> 45:29.770
Garcia...

45:35.025 --> 45:37.820
THE EXTRADITABLES

45:45.577 --> 45:47.830
Hello? Yes.

45:52.292 --> 45:53.502
Yes.

45:56.422 --> 45:57.881
But everything is fine?

46:01.009 --> 46:02.219
All right.

46:18.861 --> 46:20.154
Ana?

46:31.665 --> 46:32.708
Ana?

46:42.009 --> 46:43.218
Ana?

46:47.431 --> 46:48.599
Ana!

46:51.894 --> 46:55.522
A little bird... came into the house.

46:56.148 --> 46:57.774
I'm helping it out.

47:09.077 --> 47:10.204
What?

47:15.501 --> 47:17.544
There was an assassination attempt...

47:19.630 --> 47:22.090
on Colonel Carrillo.

47:22.174 --> 47:23.467
Did someone die?

47:25.677 --> 47:27.095
One of his men.

47:30.140 --> 47:33.101
It must be terrible,
the position you're in.

47:33.852 --> 47:37.105
I want you to know...
I think you are very brave.

47:39.942 --> 47:43.695
I'm not brave. Not like Galén.

47:44.905 --> 47:46.990
That fear keeps you alive.

47:48.575 --> 47:51.119
That's what none of them understand.

47:55.040 --> 47:58.502
I will support any decision you make.

52:00.285 --> 52:01.453
<i>Hello?</i>

52:02.704 --> 52:04.873
You think you're hot shit?

52:04.956 --> 52:07.334
You should change your satellite phone.

52:09.211 --> 52:10.629
Who is this?

52:10.712 --> 52:14.299
<i>Your mother's in Rionegro
with that tub of lard you call your son.</i>

52:15.425 --> 52:18.720
<i>And your wife was at Carrera 11 today,
shopping for clothes.</i>

52:18.804 --> 52:20.806
You bastard son of a bitch,
you think that--

52:20.889 --> 52:24.768
What, you think because you're a cop
I'm afraid of you or something?

52:24.851 --> 52:27.521
<i>You know where my family is, fag,
well, I know where yours is, too.</i>

52:27.687 --> 52:28.814
<i>Don't forget that.</i>

52:28.897 --> 52:30.190
Gonorrhea bastard son of a bitch.

52:30.273 --> 52:32.442
Why don't you take money
like everyone else?

52:32.526 --> 52:35.278
I could have had you living like a king.
But now, guess what?

52:35.362 --> 52:40.784
Time to kill your dad, your mom,
your kids, your entire family,

52:40.867 --> 52:42.953
and you should be smart enough to realize

52:43.036 --> 52:47.666
I have each and every one of them
under watch, you fucking bastard.

52:47.749 --> 52:50.335
<i>Not everyone's for sale, Pablo.</i>

52:50.418 --> 52:53.171
<i>You just keep hiding and I will find you.</i>

52:53.255 --> 52:54.673
Don't <i>know</i> when...

52:54.756 --> 52:56.633
but I will find you.

52:57.425 --> 52:59.094
And when I find you...

53:00.178 --> 53:02.013
- <i>I'm</i> going <i>to</i> kill you.
- <i>I'm going to kill you, fag!</i>

53:02.097 --> 53:04.724
I'm going to kill
you and your entire family!

53:25.912 --> 53:27.622
This, then, is war.
