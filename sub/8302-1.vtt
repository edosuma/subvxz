Dude, you were born
to teach.

05:19.053 --> 05:21.386
I was, man.
I'm a good teacher.

05:21.388 --> 05:26.658
When I was a student teacher,
our math team went to
the motherfucking state finals.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.727
You goddamn right they did.
You gave those nerds
something to live for.

05:28.729 --> 05:31.063
You don't get
to the state finals
by being nice, man.

05:31.065 --> 05:34.666
Geometry isn't nice.
It's fucking hard.
Pythagorean theorem?

05:34.668 --> 05:37.369
- I don't even know
what that is.
- I am sick and tired...

05:37.371 --> 05:39.004
of waiting to be
a teacher, man.

an interview.

Let's see this résumé.

It says here you
student-taught at Bradenton.
Good school.

06:33.394 --> 06:34.993
I really enjoyed
that experience,

06:34.995 --> 06:37.462
and I actually
started a math team
that went to the state finals.

06:37.464 --> 06:40.065
I used to work
with kindergartners before
they put me behind the desk.

06:40.067 --> 06:42.033
Oh.
God, I loved
those fucking kids.

06:42.035 --> 06:44.469
Great hugs.
And their smiles?

to wake up in the morning.

06:47.007 --> 06:48.840
Absolutely.

06:49.876 --> 06:52.043
You mind?
Totally.

06:52.045 --> 06:54.746
You're allowed
to like drinking.
You know what I mean?

06:54.748 --> 06:56.448
Sure. Of course.

06:57.550 --> 06:59.451
That's why
I love those kids.

06:59.453 --> 07:03.021
I mean, if I were sad
or maybe a little drunk...

07:04.724 --> 07:06.525
They don't judge.
You know?

07:06.527 --> 07:09.661
Maybe I worked my way
through an eight ball...

07:09.663 --> 07:13.799
and woke up in St. Pete
with half a kitten
in a cardboard box.

07:13.801 --> 07:15.534
Didn't matter.

07:15.536 --> 07:19.504
Those little guys...
good for the hug, always.

07:21.040 --> 07:23.909
Well, I've always thought
that a... a nurturing approach...

07:23.911 --> 07:25.911
is much better
than being an authoritarian.

07:25.913 --> 07:27.646
That's why we do it.

07:27.648 --> 07:29.748
We don't do it
for the bitches,
that's for certain.

07:29.750 --> 07:32.784
No. I... I do not do it
for the bitches either.

07:32.786 --> 07:36.555
Well, not to say
I pay for sex.

07:36.557 --> 07:38.990
I mean, strip club occasionally,
but that's no biggie.

07:38.992 --> 07:41.193
There's nothing wrong
with a gentleman's club.

No, there isn't.

Uh, the strip club?

07:49.102 --> 07:51.937
I think I've seen it
from the highway.
With the spaceship?

07:51.939 --> 07:53.872
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

07:53.874 --> 07:57.175
A good strip club has
to have a compelling theme.

07:57.177 --> 08:00.712
Otherwise, you're just
jerking off in a warehouse.
You know?

08:02.682 --> 08:05.817
Do you mind
if I give you some advice?
Please do.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.820
This isn't teaching advice.
This is life advice.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.889
Okay, cool.

08:11.924 --> 08:14.659
Never do two illegal things
at the same time.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.228
I like that advice.

08:16.230 --> 08:18.530
Can I give you
some more advice?

08:18.532 --> 08:21.233
Do not go to a strip club
in the town you live in.

08:21.235 --> 08:24.102
Not even Odyssey?
Especially not Odyssey.

08:24.104 --> 08:26.838
Why? Because it
becomes habitual.

08:26.840 --> 08:30.008
Before you know it,
you're just stopping by
for a quick drink.

08:30.010 --> 08:34.111
And the bartender's
mixing you a "G and T"
before you even asked for it.

08:34.114 --> 08:36.280
Then one day you wake up...

08:36.283 --> 08:38.616
and guess what happens.

wanna teach, Eddie?

I don't want to do it

Why not?

01:23:37.213 --> 01:23:39.747

We can listen to some music.

We could dance.

Manhood isn't

The Internet.

Yeah. But that's it.

You could probably...
Yeah, that's what guys did.

a shoe in there or tin foil.

Like the vas deferens?

like I know, but...

and the Cowper's adds...
