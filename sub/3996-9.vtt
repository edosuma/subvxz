00:02.250 --> 00:04.410
I can't believe Jess got
roller skates for christmas.

00:04.945 --> 00:06.491
I feel so free.

00:06.946 --> 00:08.041
Don't.
See this.

00:08.733 --> 00:09.978
"Merry Christmas, Brendan.

00:09.979 --> 00:11.711
Don't swallow these.
Love, Uncle Nick."

00:11.712 --> 00:13.663
It's a great gift.
He's a 12-year-old kid,

00:13.693 --> 00:15.085
it's a bunch of tacks.
He's going to love 'em.

00:15.199 --> 00:16.665
- Give it to me.
- I hate Christmas.

00:16.731 --> 00:18.873
First of all,
it means that Hanukkah is over.

00:18.925 --> 00:21.395
Second of all, I hate it
when you guys leave and go home.

00:21.570 --> 00:22.090
When are you leaving?

00:22.246 --> 00:23.655
- Tomorrow at 3:00 p.m.
- I think 4:00 a.m.

00:23.812 --> 00:24.662
NICK: Is that it? Schmidt,

00:24.696 --> 00:25.839
don't worry about it, man,
we're all gonna

00:25.858 --> 00:27.166
hang out tonight at your office party.

00:27.514 --> 00:28.575
Please tell me you're not dressing up

00:28.576 --> 00:29.679
like Santa this year, are you?

00:29.853 --> 00:31.016
I'm the only man in the office.

00:31.176 --> 00:32.554
Of course I'm gonna dress up
like Santa.

00:32.654 --> 00:33.356
Look, I like it.

00:33.510 --> 00:35.142
I get all this dirt on my coworkers.

00:35.508 --> 00:37.007
They get drunk and they
whisper what they want

00:37.037 --> 00:39.514
for Christmas in my ear,
and then I use that information

00:39.515 --> 00:41.645
to subtly undermine them
and control them

00:41.728 --> 00:42.445
for the rest of the year.

00:42.446 --> 00:44.620
Ah, the true spirit of Christmas.

00:45.054 --> 00:46.172
Winston, you'd better watch it, man,

00:46.259 --> 00:47.335
because I will take you down.

00:47.422 --> 00:49.094
You want to go?
You want to go?

00:49.146 --> 00:50.553
You're gonna take me down?
I had figure skating lessons

00:50.626 --> 00:52.759
until I was 13,
and then my mom sobered up

00:52.809 --> 00:54.983
and realized I was a boy.
Let's do this.

00:55.060 --> 00:56.673
You should not have said that.
Hey, guys, guys, don't fight.

00:56.760 --> 00:59.230
Let's go.
You're wearing roller skates.

00:59.294 --> 01:01.563
I'm telling you, man.
Both of you, enough, hey, hey.

01:01.634 --> 01:03.188
Nothing's smart about
what you guys are doing.

01:03.268 --> 01:05.183
Why don't you both act
like grown-ups?

01:05.269 --> 01:07.326
No, no.
JESS: I need your help right now.

01:07.409 --> 01:09.027
I need you guys to get in my car

01:09.118 --> 01:10.744
and come with me to the
mall 'cause I really need

01:10.882 --> 01:13.498
to figure out what to buy Paul for...

01:13.508 --> 01:14.809
You guys are all wearing

01:14.861 --> 01:16.572
the holiday gifts I gave you.

01:16.573 --> 01:18.116
- No, I...
- That is so sweet.

01:18.117 --> 01:19.017
I need to take a picture.

01:19.232 --> 01:20.792
Jess, don't take a photo right now.

01:20.793 --> 01:22.351
- So cute.
- Don't do the photo.

01:22.734 --> 01:23.973
- Please, no pictures.
- So cute, so cute.

01:24.095 --> 01:25.397
¶ Who's that girl?

01:25.450 --> 01:26.703
<i>¶ Who's that girl? ¶</i>

01:27.913 --> 01:28.983
New Girl S01E09
"The 23rd"

01:29.033 --> 01:30.900
www.SUBTITULOS.es
==DIFUNDE LA PALABRA==

01:30.948 --> 01:31.906
So why can't you figure out

01:31.907 --> 01:33.162
what to get your boyfriend Paul?

01:33.568 --> 01:35.002
I don't know.

01:35.339 --> 01:37.458
Maybe 'cause we've only been
going out for, like, a month,

01:37.664 --> 01:38.704
so I know it's not something fancy.

01:38.779 --> 01:39.867
But do I get him a gag gift

01:39.951 --> 01:40.866
or do I get him something sweet?

01:40.952 --> 01:42.084
I don't know.

01:42.165 --> 01:43.250
Well, I think you got to figure out

01:43.327 --> 01:44.504
what you feel about him

01:44.593 --> 01:46.135
and then get a gift that reflects it.

01:46.172 --> 01:47.391
I think that's kind of the move.

01:47.407 --> 01:51.391
My initial thought was to
get him a gift certificate

01:51.422 --> 01:52.497
for piping hot sex.

01:52.563 --> 01:53.630
Really...
oh, you're being serious?

01:53.679 --> 01:55.919
But I don't want him to think
that I'm using him for his body.

01:55.920 --> 01:57.341
I'm sure he'd be okay with that.

01:59.259 --> 02:01.390
"Nerdy weird sex
that works for both of us."

02:01.391 --> 02:02.503
- Give it back.
- This is amazing.

02:02.552 --> 02:03.673
- No, come on.
- I'm gonna keep this.

02:03.674 --> 02:05.340
I'm gonna cash this in
one night and get

02:05.341 --> 02:06.609
some weird nerd sex with it.
No, but it's not for you.

02:06.817 --> 02:07.879
Oh, my God, thank you.

02:08.299 --> 02:10.085
Now I know what I'm getting my mom.

02:10.134 --> 02:11.640
Oh, my God, Nick.
It's going right to my mom.

02:11.726 --> 02:13.721
Why do we have to go
to this office party tonight?

02:13.778 --> 02:15.190
Because it's the last night

02:15.264 --> 02:16.874
before you guys go
home to your families,

02:16.924 --> 02:18.939
and we got to blow
this thing out, man.

02:19.003 --> 02:20.348
Plus, it'll be a good opportunity

02:20.349 --> 02:21.457
for you to do some networking.

02:21.852 --> 02:22.956
Help with the job search.

02:23.396 --> 02:24.898
I'm telling you, everybody's
hitting the nog,

02:24.968 --> 02:26.516
having a good time, letting loose.

02:26.565 --> 02:29.879
You swoop in there, and
then boom... new job, man.

02:29.936 --> 02:31.018
That's how things work.

02:31.512 --> 02:34.405
You know, Benjamins in
your pocket, La Pen-si-own,

02:34.406 --> 02:36.264
little four-to-the-oh-
to-the-one-to-the-kay.

02:36.871 --> 02:38.100
You're making me want to stay broke.

02:39.087 --> 02:40.273
So what'd you get Paul?

02:40.883 --> 02:43.173
I'm not telling you, but,
um, I'll give you a hint.

02:43.680 --> 02:44.366
It's fuzzy.

02:44.870 --> 02:45.888
Well, I hope you didn't
listen to Nick.

02:46.154 --> 02:47.601
He's the worst gift giver ever.

02:53.450 --> 02:54.750
You're welcome.

02:55.666 --> 02:57.087
Where are we, Jess?

02:57.580 --> 02:59.148
<i>JESS:
We are on Candy Cane Lane.</i>

02:59.507 --> 03:00.870
<i>At night, the whole block lights up</i>

03:00.961 --> 03:02.144
<i>with Christmas decorations.</i>

03:02.206 --> 03:03.552
It's so beautiful.

03:03.628 --> 03:05.630
Oh, my God, it's so beautiful.

03:05.697 --> 03:08.619
(in British accent):
What fun, what wonderful fun.

03:08.676 --> 03:10.178
Okay, whatever.

03:10.257 --> 03:11.940
We have to come back later

03:12.005 --> 03:13.498
'cause you'll see what
I'm talking about.

03:13.540 --> 03:14.474
Oh, no, we're not gonna have time.

03:14.475 --> 03:16.394
We have to go straight
from the party to the airport.

03:16.558 --> 03:17.667
- No.
- Yes, I've missed my flight

03:17.668 --> 03:19.102
four years in a row.

03:19.322 --> 03:21.301
If I miss it this year,
my mom's gonna kill me.

03:21.365 --> 03:23.305
Schmidt, it's a menorah for you.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.617
Oh, a menorah.

03:26.163 --> 03:27.225
Judaism, son.

03:32.403 --> 03:34.216
Hey, hi.

03:35.601 --> 03:36.329
You look awesome.

03:36.642 --> 03:37.445
It's a before and after

03:37.570 --> 03:38.823
for a Bolivian diet pill.

03:39.070 --> 03:40.575
El Glatrax?
Yeah, I've taken that.

03:40.785 --> 03:41.469
I'm "before."

03:42.269 --> 03:43.824
Su-Sure, you are,
look at that.

03:43.878 --> 03:45.804
So you said you wanted
to see me for something?

03:45.864 --> 03:48.119
Yes, I brought you a gift.

03:48.972 --> 03:50.211
I hope you appreciate that I have kept

03:50.212 --> 03:51.920
eye contact with you this whole time

03:51.921 --> 03:53.095
and made no reference to the fact

03:53.110 --> 03:54.094
that you are basically naked.

03:54.095 --> 03:55.251
Very proud of you, Schmidt.

03:55.557 --> 03:57.089
MAN:
Hey, hey.

04:00.528 --> 04:01.304
Oh, lot of tongue.

04:01.305 --> 04:03.060
Done with her hair?
With her...?

04:03.221 --> 04:04.307
No, I'm not the hair guy, man.

04:04.308 --> 04:05.240
CECE:
Oh, no, no, no, this is

04:05.241 --> 04:06.726
my very good friend Schmidt,

04:06.758 --> 04:08.559
and he just came by to
bring me a gift, so...

04:10.729 --> 04:11.798
It's perfume.

04:12.399 --> 04:14.345
Why does it say "Cecilia Number 5"?

04:14.660 --> 04:16.822
Actually, it says that
because... you know,

04:16.896 --> 04:18.656
I ma... I made it
specifically for you.

04:19.027 --> 04:20.242
Yeah, I found this place
on Third Street

04:20.243 --> 04:21.920
where you can design your own perfume.

04:22.046 --> 04:24.876
Base notes of cocoa
because of your brown, uh...

04:25.371 --> 04:26.130
ness.

04:26.570 --> 04:28.930
Sea salt, because it
kind of sounds like Cece.

04:30.060 --> 04:31.038
Uh, and sandalwood...

04:31.480 --> 04:33.414
Sandalwood...
always up to no good.

04:35.529 --> 04:36.293
That's, um...

04:36.576 --> 04:36.982
Ha.

04:38.616 --> 04:39.784
Thank you.
Yeah.

04:40.116 --> 04:41.750
Thanks.
Neat.

04:41.810 --> 04:42.704
Let's get back to work.

04:43.643 --> 04:45.367
Yeah, okay, um...

04:46.846 --> 04:47.638
I'll see you tonight.

04:47.724 --> 04:49.378
Yeah. Yeah, I'll just...
I'll see you there.

04:49.401 --> 04:50.067
We'll do that.

04:52.320 --> 04:54.118
BOTH:
Three, two, one.

04:54.138 --> 04:54.686
Go.

04:55.193 --> 04:56.264
Envelope.

04:56.319 --> 04:57.438
Festive bag.
I was afraid

04:57.481 --> 04:59.600
you were going to get me
jewelry, so...

04:59.664 --> 05:00.914
Oh, no.

05:00.960 --> 05:02.116
What is it?

05:02.202 --> 05:03.484
Oh, my God.

05:03.486 --> 05:06.463
Oh, my God, two tickets to Vienna

05:06.541 --> 05:10.113
and passes to the
Salzburg Music Festival?

05:10.158 --> 05:11.993
That's, like, incredible.

05:12.095 --> 05:13.493
You're gonna love it.
I'm speechless.

05:13.495 --> 05:17.053
And, um, all I got you was...

05:17.055 --> 05:21.445
"Anatomically correct heart
of a 50-year-old nonsmoker."

05:21.586 --> 05:25.703
(toy heart beating)

05:25.935 --> 05:27.314
(laughing) You know what?

05:27.398 --> 05:29.639
Normally I'm, like,
really good at giving gifts,

05:29.710 --> 05:30.866
and I thought that was romantic,

05:30.941 --> 05:33.241
but it's just...
so creepy.

05:33.303 --> 05:35.352
I, I'm sorry, I have
to get you something better.

05:35.438 --> 05:37.477
No, it's great, I love it.

05:37.483 --> 05:42.194
It's funny an-and quirky
and, and so sweet.

05:42.329 --> 05:44.152
It's like you.

05:44.372 --> 05:45.852
That's why I love it.

05:45.854 --> 05:47.163
I love it.

05:47.246 --> 05:48.650
Thank you, I love it.

05:49.051 --> 05:51.843
I... I love you.

You're very welcome.

06:06.522 --> 06:07.821
<i>You're welcome.</i>

06:09.052 --> 06:13.372
(toy heart beating)

06:16.518 --> 06:17.367
<i>NICK:
Look at you, all dressed up.</i>

06:17.368 --> 06:18.927
What, are you
in The Temptations tonight?

06:19.265 --> 06:22.409
That's so cute, Nick, you're
intimidated by my style.

06:22.410 --> 06:23.294
But I'll tell you what...

06:23.295 --> 06:24.967
one of us is walking
out of here with a job.

06:25.726 --> 06:26.226
Where you going?

06:26.227 --> 06:27.388
You wore my present.

06:27.478 --> 06:28.468
I did.

06:28.567 --> 06:30.043
Thank you, I love it.
Yay.

06:30.295 --> 06:32.410
She's seen it now,
so maybe you can take it off.

06:32.457 --> 06:34.248
You look like a man.

06:34.303 --> 06:35.493
I know, right?
That's what's freaking me out.

06:35.587 --> 06:37.306
Good humor and
fun... God forbid.

06:39.051 --> 06:40.808
WINSTON: Is that Schmidt?
NICK: Oh.

06:40.971 --> 06:42.588
What the...?

06:42.636 --> 06:43.952
Hey, guys.

06:44.001 --> 06:45.122
KIM:
Whoa, whoa,

06:45.167 --> 06:46.456
Schmidt, Santa voice.

06:46.501 --> 06:47.649
This isn't temple.

06:47.651 --> 06:49.886
Ho, ho, ho.

06:51.130 --> 06:53.503
Are those my shorts?

06:53.583 --> 06:56.574
(exhales)

06:58.469 --> 07:00.367
NICK:
Hey, what's wrong, Jess?

07:00.447 --> 07:01.266
Hey, Nick.

07:03.272 --> 07:04.804
Paul told me he loved me.

07:04.863 --> 07:06.971
Hmm. And I couldn't say it back,

07:07.032 --> 07:09.896
so I, um, said "Thank you,"

07:10.048 --> 07:12.333
which was horrible.

07:12.417 --> 07:14.784
I don't know what to do
because I am always

07:14.785 --> 07:16.851
the one who loves more.

07:17.016 --> 07:17.904
That's my thing.

07:18.847 --> 07:20.127
One time I went on a date

07:20.128 --> 07:23.278
and by 11:00 p.m.,
I gave the guy my ATM code.

07:23.279 --> 07:24.226
What is your ATM code?

07:24.319 --> 07:24.916
42...

07:25.857 --> 07:26.816
Very funny.

07:26.982 --> 07:29.007
Very good try, but no.

07:29.008 --> 07:29.795
Not a try...
I got it.

07:30.724 --> 07:32.921
If you don't have feelings
for Paul, you got to tell him.

07:32.922 --> 07:34.992
I can't do that
to someone on Christmas.

07:35.354 --> 07:36.304
And then it's New Year's.

07:36.346 --> 07:38.537
Then it's going to be
Valentine's Day and then,

07:38.892 --> 07:40.361
whoa, it's Presidents' Day.

07:40.363 --> 07:43.123
Hard to argue with that logic,
but just tell him.

07:43.190 --> 07:45.024
Don't lead him on...
you'll just hurt him more.

07:46.578 --> 07:47.085
Okay.

07:48.125 --> 07:48.779
I'm gonna do it.

07:49.285 --> 07:50.017
I'm gonna tell him.

07:50.179 --> 07:50.997
- You are?
- Yeah.

07:55.438 --> 07:56.881
Hey, what are you doing in here?

07:59.295 --> 08:00.204
Kyle's being a jerk.

08:00.570 --> 08:01.582
What are you doing in here?

08:01.754 --> 08:04.083
Eating cookies
and avoiding confrontation.

08:04.530 --> 08:06.531
Remember when Christmas used
to be fun and all I had to do

08:06.560 --> 08:08.376
was worry about my drunk
uncle asking me out?

08:08.389 --> 08:09.608
Yes, Uncle Pardeep.

08:10.145 --> 08:11.254
He thought I was a boy.

08:11.255 --> 08:12.564
Such a weirdo.

08:18.951 --> 08:19.745
Okay.

08:25.569 --> 08:25.990
Hey, man.

08:26.093 --> 08:26.506
Hey.

08:27.608 --> 08:28.322
How you doing, Paul?

08:28.625 --> 08:29.425
Good.

08:30.142 --> 08:31.213
Has Jess not talked to you?

08:31.769 --> 08:32.722
Oh, yeah, no, we talked.

08:32.722 --> 08:34.172
- Yeah, yeah, no, I...
- She did, okay.

08:34.272 --> 08:35.955
Yeah, it's hard, you know,

08:36.022 --> 08:37.543
it's really tricky.
It's like she doesn't

08:37.561 --> 08:40.501
love you right now, Paul,
but that's not to say

08:40.503 --> 08:42.017
she might not fall in
love with you later.

08:42.438 --> 08:44.291
I think that's the positive
way of looking at it,

08:44.533 --> 08:45.903
but it's hard, man, believe me.

08:46.793 --> 08:51.105
We talked about how
we might have to drive you

08:51.107 --> 08:53.354
to the airport 'cause you're
gonna miss your flight.

08:55.081 --> 08:56.818
Yeah, that was probably
all you guys talked about,

08:56.819 --> 08:57.864
so I'm joking.

08:58.092 --> 09:00.438
W-Wait a minute.
Because she hasn't...

09:00.548 --> 09:02.788
Yeah, I know...
guess what, Paul.

09:03.107 --> 09:04.156
Don't even think right now.

09:04.231 --> 09:04.634
I'm drunk.

09:04.723 --> 09:06.833
Did... Jess tell you...
I'm so drunk.

09:06.834 --> 09:07.650
that she doesn't love me?
What's happ...? No,

09:07.651 --> 09:09.608
shut up, you goofball.

09:09.657 --> 09:11.956
I'm... this conversation
didn't happen.

09:11.957 --> 09:13.544
Did Jess tell you she doesn't love me?

09:17.524 --> 09:18.462
Joke.

09:20.782 --> 09:22.644
But he's the best guy, Cece.

09:22.836 --> 09:24.119
Maybe I should just make it work.

09:24.509 --> 09:25.866
Yeah, no, Jess, you can't

09:25.867 --> 09:28.277
just dive into something
like this right now.

09:29.012 --> 09:32.409
Yeah, I just wish I could stay
in this bathroom all night.

09:32.410 --> 09:34.642
(toilet flushes) Me, too.

09:34.643 --> 09:35.581
(grunting)

09:36.124 --> 09:39.416
Whoo, that eggnog is deadly.

09:39.465 --> 09:42.340
(laughs)

09:42.440 --> 09:43.897
(chuckles) We got to get out of here.

09:43.964 --> 09:45.326
Yeah, we do.

09:45.522 --> 09:48.317
I should just put it off till
later, after the holidays.

09:48.319 --> 09:49.686
You coming?

09:49.769 --> 09:51.981
Yeah, I'll be out in a sec.

09:52.014 --> 09:53.488
Kyle wants to go to this party.

09:53.517 --> 09:55.978
Ugh, Kyle is the living worst.

09:56.014 --> 09:57.238
Yeah, I know.

09:57.311 --> 09:59.359
Did he even get you a gift?

10:00.853 --> 10:02.706
No.

10:09.592 --> 10:11.448
(sniffs)

10:11.596 --> 10:14.596
(coughs violently)

10:14.665 --> 10:16.118
Who wants to sit at a desk all day?

10:16.180 --> 10:18.064
Not me... I don't want
to have to do that.

10:18.223 --> 10:20.220
I don't want to call
Wednesday "hump day."

10:20.462 --> 10:23.481
I don't even know how to network.

10:23.483 --> 10:25.192
So what's your deal, man?

10:25.337 --> 10:26.567
Why are you sitting here by yourself?

10:26.569 --> 10:28.625
Mommy won't let me sit in Santa's lap.

10:28.695 --> 10:29.878
(chuckles) You have a smart mommy.

10:29.929 --> 10:31.745
WOMAN:
Yeah.

10:31.811 --> 10:34.504
Hi, I'm the genius who brought
my kid to this Christmas party.

10:34.551 --> 10:37.520
Looking forward to years
of therapy over Dirty Santa.

10:37.522 --> 10:39.444
I can't believe
that he's even talking to you.

10:39.446 --> 10:40.727
He doesn't like anyone.

10:40.833 --> 10:42.331
Yeah, I don't like anyone.

10:42.531 --> 10:43.685
Yeah, but we're really
working on that.

10:43.731 --> 10:45.040
No, she's working on that.

10:45.125 --> 10:47.152
(laughs)

10:47.205 --> 10:48.697
WINSTON:
My man.

10:48.800 --> 10:49.618
CECE: Okay? KYLE: You think it's fun?

10:49.681 --> 10:50.542
Do it.
I do think it's fun.

10:50.623 --> 10:52.032
Do it then.

10:52.116 --> 10:54.528
Do it.

10:54.573 --> 10:56.298
Okay.

10:56.355 --> 10:58.044
What are you doing, Santa?

10:58.112 --> 11:00.469
I have a really bad case of Santa lap.

11:00.549 --> 11:02.683
The entire marketing department
is wearing wool.

11:02.732 --> 11:04.132
It's not good down there.

11:04.194 --> 11:06.418
Well, get back to work soon.

11:06.498 --> 11:08.471
Boom!
Ow! Why would you...?

11:08.536 --> 11:10.811
There are so many bobby pins up there.

11:10.868 --> 11:13.219
Everything's attached...
Does she always talk to you like that?

11:13.264 --> 11:14.563
Yeah, kind of.

11:14.649 --> 11:16.707
You like dressing up like Santa?

11:16.762 --> 11:18.223
Sexy Santa.

11:18.266 --> 11:20.448
No. The truth is, no, I don't.

11:20.523 --> 11:22.262
You know, you don't deserve
to be treated like that.

11:22.360 --> 11:23.767
You just got to tell her no.

11:23.853 --> 11:25.233
Otherwise, all she'll do is see you

11:25.327 --> 11:26.909
as a pretty face and a hot body.

11:26.990 --> 11:28.603
I'm sorry, what was that?

11:29.244 --> 11:30.539
- You have a pretty face.
- No, no, no,

11:30.592 --> 11:31.783
'cause the second part.

11:31.871 --> 11:33.620
And I'd like you to say it,
like, in an accent,

11:33.692 --> 11:35.231
but make direct eye contact.
Yes, Schmidt,

11:35.280 --> 11:37.444
do not push your luck with me.

11:37.531 --> 11:39.541
(sniffs) What's that smell?

11:39.582 --> 11:41.071
That's your perfume.

11:41.121 --> 11:42.510
You wore it?

11:42.573 --> 11:44.180
Yeah, and it smells terrible.

11:44.247 --> 11:45.427
Ha!

11:45.514 --> 11:46.619
<i>It does smell terrible.</i>

11:46.712 --> 11:48.435
It's like a dirty dish towel.

11:48.512 --> 11:50.799
Santa voice!

11:50.877 --> 11:52.529
Please just tell me what she said.

11:52.596 --> 11:54.360
She said the sex is really great,

11:54.412 --> 11:56.690
but she just doesn't want
to jump into anything.

11:56.837 --> 11:58.920
Why am I talking about this?
Oh, my God,

11:58.971 --> 12:00.992
<i>the sex is great, it's amazing.</i>

12:01.071 --> 12:02.355
Great.
We had amazing sex

12:02.422 --> 12:05.230
this morning,
and then we ate Taro chips.

12:05.232 --> 12:07.782
Oh, my God. Oh, oh.
Oh, God. I...

12:07.881 --> 12:11.453
I feel like such a terrible guy
for saying that to you, man.

12:11.537 --> 12:13.268
Oh, my God.
You're a good guy, Genzlinger.

12:13.319 --> 12:15.043
Hey, man, just let it go.

12:15.117 --> 12:17.116
You know what I mean?
Just let it

12:17.171 --> 12:18.419
brush off your shoulders, dude.
Oh, man.

12:18.468 --> 12:19.961
What has happened to my life? Hey.

12:21.298 --> 12:23.257
Why are you guys hugging?

12:23.299 --> 12:24.958
Just guy-talkin'.
Yeah.

12:25.052 --> 12:26.502
Yeah?
Everything's fine.

12:26.587 --> 12:28.484
We're just talking.
Just talking.

12:28.568 --> 12:30.003
About, uh...

12:30.005 --> 12:34.206
how moved we are...
by jazz music.

12:34.363 --> 12:36.362
That's a lie.

12:36.432 --> 12:38.431
I told him you didn't love him, Jess.

12:38.483 --> 12:39.320
What?!
Because I...

12:39.394 --> 12:40.426
But he said it nicely.

12:40.479 --> 12:42.514
Are you kidding me?!

12:42.606 --> 12:44.004
It's not your information to share.
I totally agree,

12:44.092 --> 12:45.311
and I regret it.
It is not your information...

12:45.407 --> 12:46.987
Why would you do that?
I apologize.

12:47.077 --> 12:48.409
You guys have a lot to do.
I'm sorry. Nick. Nick.

12:49.467 --> 12:50.616
Oh, my God.

12:50.664 --> 12:52.862
Please! This is my nightmare!

12:52.938 --> 12:54.642
Winston!

12:54.693 --> 12:55.806
Schmidt!

12:55.863 --> 12:58.730
Help me...!

13:01.325 --> 13:03.081
Paul, I really care about you.

13:03.613 --> 13:04.459
I think I just...

13:05.132 --> 13:06.769
I think I just feel
really overwhelmed.

13:07.404 --> 13:10.199
Yeah. Yeah, I know,
Nicholas told m...

13:10.200 --> 13:11.254
(door rattling) NICK: Damn it.

13:11.489 --> 13:13.033
Hey, guys, just pretend I'm not here,

13:13.123 --> 13:15.243
and just do whatever
you two guys are doing.

13:15.330 --> 13:16.997
I'm not here.
I'm not even listening.

13:17.045 --> 13:18.752
(grunts):
This is my nightmare.

13:18.832 --> 13:21.493
I-I knew you were getting
out of a long relationship.

13:21.548 --> 13:23.245
You told me all about Spencer.
I just thought...

13:23.332 --> 13:24.880
I thought we were
feeling the same things

13:24.926 --> 13:25.825
for each other.

13:25.963 --> 13:27.068
You seemed like you were.

13:27.227 --> 13:29.211
I was. I just...
(door rattling)

13:29.361 --> 13:31.450
I feel like maybe
you were feeling them

13:31.726 --> 13:33.480
a little bit more than me.

13:33.482 --> 13:34.540
(door rattling) Nick!

13:34.592 --> 13:35.675
You started this.

13:35.733 --> 13:36.936
Sit down and be quiet!

13:39.895 --> 13:42.237
I just... I got really hurt,

13:42.324 --> 13:46.587
and I... I'm trying really
hard not to get hurt again.

13:46.589 --> 13:48.960
(lively Latin music playing)
PAUL: I'm not gonna hurt you.

13:49.091 --> 13:51.285
(music continues) Oh.

13:51.362 --> 13:52.525
Oh...

13:52.574 --> 13:54.580
I am so sorry.

13:54.679 --> 13:57.248
This is as rude as it gets.

13:57.316 --> 13:59.840
It is my mom, though.

13:59.842 --> 14:02.059
(music stops)
I... Hey, Ma. How you doing?

14:02.126 --> 14:03.569
I can't talk right now.

14:03.571 --> 14:05.571
I'm in a real weird situation.

14:05.625 --> 14:08.070
(laughs): No, Ma, I'm not high...
I'm done with that phase.

14:09.442 --> 14:11.028
I promise you I won't miss my flight.

14:11.226 --> 14:12.884
Okay. I love you, Mama. Bye.

14:13.644 --> 14:14.999
You done?

14:17.127 --> 14:17.820
Can we just...

14:19.383 --> 14:22.169
can we just keep going
but take it a little bit slow?

14:22.291 --> 14:24.064
I-I don't know
if I can do that.

14:24.278 --> 14:26.265
I don't know how with you.

14:26.632 --> 14:28.723
It's just not how I feel. Well, all

14:28.724 --> 14:30.199
she's asking you to do
is slow it down a little bit.

14:30.210 --> 14:30.973
- How's that hard?
- Nick.

14:31.480 --> 14:32.115
Yeah.

14:34.240 --> 14:35.318
All right, everybody leave the room.

14:35.319 --> 14:36.395
I need to talk to Kim.

14:37.374 --> 14:38.449
Okay, you know what?
Actually,

14:38.623 --> 14:40.355
stay... this'll
be good for you guys

14:40.368 --> 14:41.123
to hear this, too.

14:41.390 --> 14:42.945
- Why d... Don't...
- Come on.

14:43.217 --> 14:44.647
I just told... There are two hours left

14:44.703 --> 14:45.756
in this party.

14:45.855 --> 14:47.130
What are you doing, Santa?

14:47.204 --> 14:49.384
Kim, I'm not gonna be
Sexy Santa anymore.

14:49.494 --> 14:51.192
It's over.
Santa's dead.

14:51.240 --> 14:52.440
I killed him.

14:52.684 --> 14:54.381
(screams)

14:54.431 --> 14:56.448
KIM: Oh, my God.
No, no, no, don't worry, that's just

14:56.528 --> 14:57.649
Gina's cowardly son.

14:57.728 --> 14:59.457
He is a scream machine.

14:59.538 --> 15:01.245
Kim, I'm not a sex object, all right?

15:01.333 --> 15:02.866
I'm your employee.

15:02.922 --> 15:04.435
And I work harder than anyone.

15:04.437 --> 15:06.468
I'm the first one
to show up every morning.

15:06.470 --> 15:07.208
No, you're not.

15:07.452 --> 15:08.791
There's never a parking space.

15:08.863 --> 15:10.165
That's because everyone's
already here, Nick.

15:10.235 --> 15:11.540
Okay, you're so off topic right now.

15:11.582 --> 15:12.670
You're missing the point.
What?

15:12.741 --> 15:14.575
You need to take me seriously, Kim.

15:14.627 --> 15:16.296
Does that mean no more...

15:16.389 --> 15:17.918
Sexy Easter Bunny?

15:17.962 --> 15:19.120
No Sexy Easter Bunny.

15:19.204 --> 15:21.456
What about, uh, Cinco de Sexy?

15:21.543 --> 15:22.694
No Cinco de Sexy.

15:22.761 --> 15:24.220
And no Sexy Martin Luther King?

15:24.222 --> 15:25.602
I could never get the voice,

15:25.691 --> 15:27.425
I never really felt
like I had the authority...

15:27.465 --> 15:29.553
I can't believe it took you
five years to say that.

15:29.605 --> 15:30.875
Well, I guess I'm gonna

15:30.877 --> 15:33.302
have to be Sexy Santa next year.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.359
Yeah, just got to jingle bell rock.

15:35.537 --> 15:36.387
You know what I mean?

15:37.096 --> 15:38.581
That is so inappropriate.

15:38.582 --> 15:40.841
I get it... so you can dish
it out but you can't take it.

15:41.733 --> 15:42.943
Yeah, how's that feel, Kim?

15:44.435 --> 15:45.265
I like it.

15:46.925 --> 15:48.185
Both these machines need toner.

15:49.460 --> 15:52.068
They need... I'm gonna
put the toner in the...

15:52.106 --> 15:52.880
in the machine.

15:53.463 --> 15:55.498
Mrs. Miller, I told you,

15:55.499 --> 15:56.992
I will get Nick to his flight on time.

15:56.993 --> 15:57.827
No worries.

15:58.042 --> 15:59.595
I can't find Elvin.
I've looked everywhere.

15:59.596 --> 16:01.660
I-I have no idea.
Uh, you know what?

16:01.661 --> 16:03.820
I got to go. Um, I'm sure
he's around here somewhere.

16:03.821 --> 16:05.098
- We'll find him.
- Elvin!

16:05.157 --> 16:07.405
I'll tell you what, you go
that way, I'll go that way.

16:08.350 --> 16:10.810
- This is Schmidt's fault. I don't know how, but it is.
- Elvin?

16:11.401 --> 16:13.142
I'm sorry, Jess, I just...

16:13.144 --> 16:15.234
I don't want to slow
down... with you.

16:15.318 --> 16:17.639
It's just not natural.
So if you need to,

16:17.641 --> 16:20.270
then... I don't think
I can do this anymore.

16:23.631 --> 16:26.126
Okay.

16:26.193 --> 16:27.657
Come on, Paul!

16:27.659 --> 16:28.992
It's Christmas!

16:29.089 --> 16:30.834
Don't break up with her... Hey, Nick...

16:31.056 --> 16:32.553
(whispers):
It's okay.

16:32.612 --> 16:34.348
(exhales)

16:34.425 --> 16:36.929
Hey, have you guys seen a
little kid running around here?

16:36.988 --> 16:38.253
(chuckling)

16:41.111 --> 16:42.197
Thank you.

16:50.840 --> 16:53.525
Ah. I see you found
Santa's house.

16:54.238 --> 16:55.127
I was looking for it.

16:55.318 --> 16:57.635
The man with no shirt killed Santa.

16:57.881 --> 16:59.349
(laughs) Oh, you mean Schmidt.

16:59.748 --> 17:01.223
Well, he was just
dressing up like Santa.

17:01.445 --> 17:03.039
Then why didn't he have a shirt?

17:03.109 --> 17:05.252
You know, we ask ourselves
that question every single day.

17:05.438 --> 17:08.794
Is it because he's a D-bag?
Mommy says he's a D-bag.

17:09.851 --> 17:10.824
(laughs) You know something?

17:11.339 --> 17:12.829
You're a really smart kid.

17:13.009 --> 17:15.972
And for that, Santa's gonna bring
you extra presents this year.

17:16.258 --> 17:17.548
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:17.994 --> 17:19.406
Thank you, LeBron.

17:20.938 --> 17:21.992
Okay, cool, I'll be him.

17:22.358 --> 17:23.223
You found him!

17:23.366 --> 17:25.317
Yeah.
Hi!

17:26.101 --> 17:27.703
(whispers):
Extra gifts this year.

17:27.765 --> 17:29.804
You're really good at this.
Seriously.

17:30.101 --> 17:32.440
If you ever want to hang
out with Elvin again...

17:33.587 --> 17:34.870
I will pay you a lot of money.

17:35.105 --> 17:36.105
Let's go.

17:37.178 --> 17:37.734
A lot.

17:38.333 --> 17:38.922
Thank you.

17:39.381 --> 17:40.762
Like, whatever you're thinking,

17:40.933 --> 17:43.011
add money to that...
'cause that's what I...

17:43.498 --> 17:44.028
Like, a lot.

17:44.447 --> 17:45.724
Bye, Elvin.

17:45.784 --> 17:46.905
Bye, LeBron.

17:47.925 --> 17:48.916
(phone vibrating) Yep.

17:51.561 --> 17:53.187
(chuckles)

17:53.254 --> 17:55.318
What up, Mrs. Miller?

17:55.368 --> 17:57.315
Yes, yes. Actually,
we're on our way right now,

17:57.407 --> 17:58.908
so just go back to sleep.

17:58.966 --> 18:00.850
We're getting Nick
to the airport, okay?

18:00.941 --> 18:02.777
<i>WINSTON: What kind of
airline has flights that</i>

18:05.275 --> 18:06.685
<i>Actually, what's that smell?</i>

18:06.786 --> 18:08.685
It's nothing. Oh.
That's my perfume.

18:08.779 --> 18:10.526
(groans) Oh, God, that is bad.

18:10.614 --> 18:12.358
But the weird kind of bad

18:12.492 --> 18:14.705
that makes you want
to smell it again. (sniffs)

18:19.428 --> 18:22.795
Okay, there's something
that we got to do. Sorry.

18:22.846 --> 18:25.290
<i>What are you doing, man!
(others speaking at once)</i>

18:25.340 --> 18:26.953
SCHMIDT: Hold on, you're going
in the wrong direction!

18:30.683 --> 18:32.794
<i>I think we're too late, Nick.</i>

18:32.850 --> 18:35.221
Yeah, this was supposed
to be your gift, Jess.

18:35.298 --> 18:36.846
I screwed it up.

18:36.900 --> 18:38.161
I'm sorry.

18:38.163 --> 18:40.245
(engine turns off)

18:42.003 --> 18:44.740
Candy Cane Lane is shut down!

18:44.876 --> 18:46.862
Should've got her perfume, man.

18:46.944 --> 18:48.190
Nice, man.

18:53.089 --> 18:54.231
Man.

18:54.341 --> 18:55.534
Yeah.

18:55.618 --> 18:58.736
<i>I have the worst timing.</i>

19:00.510 --> 19:03.025
I'm always in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

19:04.830 --> 19:06.749
Let's go.

19:06.859 --> 19:09.050
We should go.
No, we don't...

19:10.196 --> 19:11.523
Jess, no.

19:11.590 --> 19:12.912
It's Christmas.
It's our Christmas.

19:12.914 --> 19:14.936
We came here to see the lights.

19:15.026 --> 19:17.880
JESS: Well, what are we gonna do?

19:17.932 --> 19:20.657
Yeah, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

19:20.728 --> 19:22.935
It's 2:00 a.m.
Why would they turn them off?

19:22.937 --> 19:24.398
It doesn't make sense to me. Nick!

19:24.454 --> 19:25.996
We don't got time for this. (knocking)

19:26.050 --> 19:27.279
Excuse me, guys?

19:27.430 --> 19:28.400
<i>Oh, hell, no!</i>

19:28.493 --> 19:29.691
Excuse me, we got a girl out here

19:29.743 --> 19:30.834
who'd really like to see the lights!

19:30.836 --> 19:33.227
Sorry to wake you!
This is rude!

19:33.299 --> 19:35.780
(dogs barking) Make it the
Candy Cane Lane or whatever!

19:35.782 --> 19:38.333
You spend all this time
to show off and do it,

19:38.335 --> 19:39.944
so show off... you
got an audience!

19:40.032 --> 19:41.878
This whole neighborhood is ridiculous!

19:41.915 --> 19:44.498
You all show off,
so turn on the lights!

19:44.576 --> 19:48.541
Just go in the shed or whatever and turn
your damn lights on, you show-offs!

19:48.586 --> 19:49.577
Turn on your lights!
Turn on the lights!

19:49.632 --> 19:51.715
Turn on your lights!

19:51.775 --> 19:53.146
(others shouting)

19:53.227 --> 19:55.513
Lights!
Turn on your lights!

19:55.515 --> 19:57.802
Turn on your lights!
Turn on your lights!

19:57.804 --> 20:00.588
Turn on your lights!

20:00.630 --> 20:03.533
¶ I'll be home
Turn on the lights, everybody!

20:03.610 --> 20:07.776
¶ For Christmas
(all continue shouting)

20:07.865 --> 20:09.915
¶ You

20:10.057 --> 20:12.887
¶ Can count

20:12.954 --> 20:13.938
¶ On me Oh! Oh!

20:13.993 --> 20:16.230
(happy shouts)

20:16.281 --> 20:18.239
¶ Please

20:18.285 --> 20:20.290
¶ Have snow

20:20.367 --> 20:23.783
¶ And mistletoe

20:23.785 --> 20:26.611
¶ And presents (shouting continues)

20:26.657 --> 20:29.890
¶ On the tree Oh, my God!

20:29.949 --> 20:32.552
(whooping, shouting)
Yes! Yes!

20:32.621 --> 20:35.831
¶ Christmas Eve

20:35.922 --> 20:38.620
¶ Will find

20:38.688 --> 20:40.760
¶ Me

20:40.811 --> 20:42.893
¶ Where

20:42.966 --> 20:44.623
¶ The love light Merry Christmas!

20:44.681 --> 20:46.460
¶ Gleams Merry Christmas, boys!

20:46.518 --> 20:47.774
Merry Christmas, everyone!

20:47.817 --> 20:49.072
Merry Hanukkah!

20:49.132 --> 20:50.943
¶ I'll

20:50.981 --> 20:52.348
¶ Be home Merry Christmas.

20:52.437 --> 20:55.687
¶ For Christmas MAN: Merry Christmas!

20:55.769 --> 20:58.314
Now, stop yelling
before I call the cops!

20:58.363 --> 20:59.830
Oh, my God.

20:59.913 --> 21:02.863
¶ My dreams...

21:04.666 --> 21:05.918
(laughing)

21:05.988 --> 21:08.586
Candy Cane Lane is
the crème de la crme

21:08.657 --> 21:10.996
It is... amazing.
of decorated streets.

21:11.053 --> 21:13.356
Hey, Ma! How are you?

21:13.638 --> 21:16.664
Yeah. No, I'm gonna
miss my flight.

21:16.710 --> 21:18.105
Yeah, I'm sorry. No.

21:18.175 --> 21:20.716
Ma, stop yelling at me,
please stop yelling.

21:20.869 --> 21:22.503
Ma, I'm not high!
Stop yelling!

21:22.505 --> 21:24.212
I'm driving a car.
I can't talk.

21:24.359 --> 21:25.742
Hey, remember Winston?

21:25.944 --> 21:27.595

Talk to her.</i>
