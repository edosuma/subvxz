WEBVTT

00:00.263 --> 00:01.975
My name
is Michael Westen.

00:01.976 --> 00:04.043
I used to be
a spy until...

00:04.395 --> 00:05.479
we got a burn notice on you.

00:05.530 --> 00:07.397
You're blacklisted.

00:07.482 --> 00:09.783
When you're burned,
you've got nothing.

00:09.850 --> 00:12.035
No cash, no credit,
no job history.

00:12.120 --> 00:14.371
You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.

00:14.455 --> 00:16.823
- Where am I?
- Miami.

00:16.874 --> 00:19.159
You do whatever work
comes your way.

00:19.210 --> 00:21.328
You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you...

00:22.863 --> 00:23.797
A trigger-happy girlfriend...

00:23.864 --> 00:25.215
Should we shoot them?

00:25.299 --> 00:27.217
An old friend who used
to inform on you to the FBI...

00:27.301 --> 00:29.836
You know spies--
bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:29.887 --> 00:31.221
Family too...

00:31.305 --> 00:32.139
hey, is that your mom again?

00:32.206 --> 00:33.306
If you're desperate.

00:33.374 --> 00:34.654
Someone needs your help,
Michael.

00:34.675 --> 00:37.394
And a down-and-out spy
you met along the way.

00:37.478 --> 00:38.979
That's how we do it,
people.

00:39.046 --> 00:41.714
Bottom line,
as long as you're burned,

00:41.766 --> 00:43.600
You're not going anywhere.

00:46.854 --> 00:48.555
It's not easy knowing
how far to go

00:48.606 --> 00:50.073
To build trust.

00:50.158 --> 00:51.408
Last night,
Sonya and I--

00:51.492 --> 00:52.776
Why are you
telling me this, Michael?

00:52.860 --> 00:54.161
I couldn't ask for you
to be part

00:54.228 --> 00:55.695
of this operation
without you knowing everything.

00:55.747 --> 00:58.198
Michael, it's not okay
to sleep with the enemy.

00:58.249 --> 01:00.233
She is still
the enemy, right?

01:00.284 --> 01:03.903
When we find a monster,
we destroy it.

01:03.955 --> 01:05.238
There's your first monster.

01:05.289 --> 01:08.425
This is Ben Snyder.
He'll be running the Op.

01:08.509 --> 01:13.046
Snyder, get back.
It's gonna blow.

01:14.515 --> 01:17.634
Snyder!

01:17.718 --> 01:20.437
- Snyder, where's Fiona?
- She didn't make it.

01:20.521 --> 01:22.939
Did you see
her die?

01:23.024 --> 01:25.258
A member of your team
almost died today

01:25.309 --> 01:27.277
because of this man's
lack of action.

01:27.361 --> 01:28.862
He made a mistake.

01:28.929 --> 01:30.447
He made
a promise, Michael.

01:30.531 --> 01:33.733
And promises
must be kept.

01:33.785 --> 01:37.737
Tell me I'm wrong.

01:40.458 --> 01:41.958
In the spy world,

01:42.043 --> 01:44.828
often the only things
you know about a covert mission

01:44.912 --> 01:46.580
are your deployment orders

01:46.631 --> 01:48.781
and a list of equipment
to bring.

01:48.833 --> 01:51.051
Sometimes, that tells
you nothing.

01:51.118 --> 01:53.220
And sometimes,
it can tell a lot.

01:53.287 --> 01:55.055
The make of your weapon
tells you

01:55.122 --> 01:56.506
if you'll be
in open combat

01:56.591 --> 01:58.642
or firing
from the shadows.

01:58.726 --> 02:00.260
The ammunition
you're bringing

02:00.311 --> 02:02.395
can indicate whether
you're there primarily

02:02.463 --> 02:05.732
to defend
or to kill.

02:05.799 --> 02:07.479
When you're leaving
under cover of darkness

02:07.485 --> 02:09.102
under a false name,

02:09.152 --> 02:11.771
you can be sure
that whatever the job is,

02:11.823 --> 02:14.974
it won't be pretty.

02:17.144 --> 02:18.411
It's me, Michael.

02:18.479 --> 02:19.919
Fi, what the hell
are you doing here?

02:19.980 --> 02:21.364
We need to talk.

02:21.449 --> 02:22.649
Do you know
how dangerous it is

02:22.667 --> 02:24.117
for you to be here
right now?

02:24.168 --> 02:26.837
I was told to leave the country
without contacting anyone.

02:26.921 --> 02:28.705
Relax.
We're alone.

02:28.789 --> 02:30.874
No one saw me follow you.
Not even you.

02:30.958 --> 02:32.926
Good, then no one
will see you leave.

02:35.796 --> 02:36.880
I'm serious, Fi.

02:36.964 --> 02:40.767
And this seriously
can't wait.

02:40.834 --> 02:42.552
What is it?

02:42.637 --> 02:44.020
You know
what it is.

02:44.105 --> 02:46.556
You stood by and watched
James Kendrick

02:46.641 --> 02:48.892
execute a man
right before your eyes.

02:48.976 --> 02:50.097
There was nothing
I could do.

02:50.144 --> 02:51.444
You could've
stopped him!

02:51.512 --> 02:52.696
And if I tried,
I would have blown my cover,

02:52.780 --> 02:54.180
and it would have
ruined everything.

02:54.198 --> 02:56.116
This is the job.

02:56.183 --> 02:59.903
Ah, right.
The job.

02:59.987 --> 03:01.404
That's why you've been
avoiding me

03:01.489 --> 03:03.156
and Sam and Jesse
ever since?

03:03.207 --> 03:04.658
Because you were
doing your job?

03:04.709 --> 03:07.360
I think it's because a part
of you likes what he did.

03:07.411 --> 03:08.495
What do you want me
to do, Fi?

03:08.546 --> 03:10.196
Snyder left you
to die.

03:10.248 --> 03:11.915
I'm not gonna shed a tear
for that man.

03:11.999 --> 03:13.466
How is that wrong?

03:13.534 --> 03:14.867
Because you're
defending a man

03:14.919 --> 03:17.504
you're supposed
to be taking down.

03:17.555 --> 03:19.539
Admit it.
You are too close to this.

03:19.590 --> 03:22.041
That's why you fit in
so well with him.

03:22.093 --> 03:23.510
That's why
he likes you so much.

03:23.561 --> 03:25.545
I'm in deep cover.

03:25.596 --> 03:27.180
I'm supposed
to make James like me.

03:27.231 --> 03:28.732
It's just a cover.

03:28.816 --> 03:29.882
Not always.

03:29.934 --> 03:31.184
I know when
you're faking it.

03:31.235 --> 03:33.570
I can see it
in your eyes.

03:33.654 --> 03:35.772
I'm doing everything
to end this mission for you,

03:35.856 --> 03:37.390
for all of us.

03:37.441 --> 03:41.077
You can't do that if you lose
yourself along the way.

03:41.162 --> 03:44.397
Don't worry
about me, Fi.

03:44.448 --> 03:45.498
I know when
to draw the line.

03:45.566 --> 03:48.752
Like you did with Sonya?

04:39.603 --> 04:42.355
Hey.
There she is.

04:42.439 --> 04:44.974
How was your, uh--
what was it--meeting?

04:45.025 --> 04:46.910
Yeah, business.

04:46.977 --> 04:48.411
An old acquaintance.

04:48.478 --> 04:50.530
Turned out to be
a complete waste of time.

04:50.614 --> 04:53.816
- Tried to call you.
- Battery.

04:53.868 --> 04:55.651
All right, well, I just--
I wanted to let you know

04:55.703 --> 04:57.837
that I had to reschedule
our meeting with Lou later.

04:57.922 --> 04:59.205
Why?
Is something wrong?

04:59.290 --> 05:00.707
No, no, I have to go check
on a thing for my mom.

05:00.791 --> 05:02.675
That's all.

05:02.760 --> 05:04.327
It won't take more
than an afternoon.

05:04.378 --> 05:05.328
Your mom?

05:05.379 --> 05:06.796
Yeah, it's probably nothing.

05:06.847 --> 05:09.015
Just some guys came by
the place, asked about me.

05:09.099 --> 05:10.550
When are you gonna go?
I'll go.

05:10.634 --> 05:13.219
No, no.

05:13.304 --> 05:17.173
My old neighborhood
is not your kind of place.

05:17.224 --> 05:18.558
Well, if it's
your kind of place,

05:18.642 --> 05:21.527
then it's
my kind of place.

05:21.612 --> 05:23.679
Well, okay.

05:23.731 --> 05:25.949
Then you're coming.
Mmhmm.

05:26.016 --> 05:28.484
Whenever possible,
spies like to know

05:28.535 --> 05:31.704
what their getting into
before they leave for a mission.

05:31.789 --> 05:33.356
When you ship out
without orders,

05:33.407 --> 05:35.742
you can't really train
or prepare.

05:35.826 --> 05:37.543
All you can do is wait
and wonder what's coming.

05:41.215 --> 05:43.549
They're here.

05:43.634 --> 05:46.002
Have a good trip?
Yeah, it was fine.

05:46.053 --> 05:47.136
Good.
Is everything here?

05:47.204 --> 05:49.889
Yes, everything
is here.

05:49.974 --> 05:54.210
Sonya, what is
the mission?

05:54.261 --> 05:55.895
You know this man?

05:55.980 --> 05:57.096
Roger Steele?

05:57.181 --> 05:58.398
Uh, worked with him
several times.

05:58.482 --> 05:59.682
He was a friend.

05:59.733 --> 06:01.434
Michael, he's been
looking into you.

06:01.518 --> 06:03.386
Into us.

06:03.437 --> 06:04.654
Well, that's
his job.

06:04.721 --> 06:07.390
He's a broker between
intelligence agencies,

06:07.441 --> 06:10.410
helps negotiate when things
go wrong.

06:10.494 --> 06:12.395
We intercepted this
a few days ago.

06:12.446 --> 06:15.114
He's already linked you
to Randall Burke, Pablo Rios.

06:15.199 --> 06:17.533
And now, he's looking
into a new operative,

06:17.584 --> 06:19.369
a female one.

06:19.420 --> 06:21.337
He's too close.

06:21.405 --> 06:22.672
He has to go.

06:22.739 --> 06:24.874
Well, that can't
be necessary.

06:24.925 --> 06:27.176
It is necessary.
I spoke to James myself.

06:27.244 --> 06:29.045
It's top priority.

06:29.096 --> 06:31.414
Your orders are to make contact
with him.

06:31.465 --> 06:33.105
Tell him you're in town
and want to visit.

06:33.183 --> 06:34.717
We go in,
scout his security,

06:34.768 --> 06:36.552
and then come up
with a plan.

06:36.603 --> 06:39.188
And then?

06:39.256 --> 06:43.309
And then,
we kill him.

06:45.646 --> 06:49.932
Is this going to be
a problem, Michael?

06:49.984 --> 06:51.868
Not a problem.

06:51.935 --> 06:53.987
I'll set up
the meeting.

06:54.071 --> 06:55.438
Good.

06:58.909 --> 07:00.910
No one's more careful
about security

07:00.961 --> 07:02.578
than a freelance spy.

07:03.522 --> 07:04.839
When you work
in intelligence

07:04.891 --> 07:06.980
and you don't have
the protection of a government,

07:06.981 --> 07:08.698
you have to assume
that everyone

07:08.783 --> 07:12.903
is a potential enemy,
even your closest friends.

07:12.987 --> 07:15.072
A careful operative
will have security

07:15.156 --> 07:17.690
as good as most
military installations.

07:17.742 --> 07:20.794
Vehicles will be searched
for explosives.

07:20.861 --> 07:22.485
And of course,
nothing that fires a bullet

07:22.486 --> 07:23.697
or sends
an electronic signal

07:23.698 --> 07:26.733
makes it
past the gate.

07:28.336 --> 07:31.004
Bottom line:
By the time you get inside,

07:31.055 --> 07:32.556
the only thing
you'll be armed with

07:32.640 --> 07:36.843
is a warm smile.

07:38.712 --> 07:40.847
Westen.

07:40.898 --> 07:42.766
Steele.

07:42.850 --> 07:44.234
Bloody hell,
how long has it been?

07:44.318 --> 07:46.603
I wanna say Prague.
2003?

07:46.687 --> 07:47.654
- No, 2002.
- Ah.

07:47.721 --> 07:48.655
Ah, I thought it was
so long,

07:48.722 --> 07:49.523
you might have
forgotten me.

07:49.574 --> 07:50.890
What, are you kidding?

07:50.942 --> 07:52.359
I nearly fell out of my chair
when you called.

07:52.410 --> 07:55.562
It's tough to keep friends
in our line of work, you know?

07:55.613 --> 07:57.364
And who's this
lovely lady?

07:57.415 --> 07:58.695
- This is Ellie.
- How do you do?

07:58.732 --> 08:00.083
Roger Steele.
It's a pleasure.

08:00.168 --> 08:01.618
Thank you.
Your home is gorgeous.

08:01.702 --> 08:04.070
Why don't you head on in
and take a closer look?

08:04.122 --> 08:06.623
Sabrina, <i>mi Amor,</i> why don't
you take Ellie around?

08:06.707 --> 08:10.043
- Sure.
- <i>Gracias, Mira.</i>

08:10.094 --> 08:11.595
So great to see you.

08:11.679 --> 08:13.096
Ah, we've got a lot
of catching up to do.

08:13.181 --> 08:14.464
Come on in.

08:16.217 --> 08:18.602
It's quite an upgrade
from the flat in London.

08:18.686 --> 08:21.921
Business must be good.
Well, it's good enough.

08:21.973 --> 08:25.392
Bought me this lovely
little slice of paradise.

08:25.443 --> 08:28.278
Oh, blueberry was
your favorite, right?

08:28.362 --> 08:30.147
Yes.

08:30.231 --> 08:32.399
Good memory.

08:32.450 --> 08:33.817
So what's going on?

08:33.900 --> 08:36.953
I heard you were in the D.R.
for a little while.

08:37.038 --> 08:40.323
My job to know these things,
you know?

08:40.408 --> 08:41.991
It's been rough,

08:42.076 --> 08:44.578
what, with the burn notice
and the CIA--

08:44.629 --> 08:46.213
The Tom Card thing.
Yes, I heard about that too.

08:46.280 --> 08:47.581
But still,
things must be good

08:47.632 --> 08:50.133
if you can visit old pals
on vacation.

08:50.218 --> 08:51.635
Actually, this is not
a vacation.

08:51.719 --> 08:53.753
The thing is, Roger,
I need a job.

08:53.804 --> 08:55.889
A job? Really?

08:55.956 --> 08:57.290
Well, I can make
a few calls.

08:57.341 --> 08:59.226
And there's
a British oil company

08:59.293 --> 09:00.933
that's expanding its operations
in Kuwait.

09:00.961 --> 09:02.262
No civilian company's
going to hire

09:02.313 --> 09:04.147
someone with my background.

09:04.232 --> 09:05.432
I meant a job
with you,

09:05.483 --> 09:08.468
on <i>your</i> security team.

09:10.738 --> 09:12.239
Mike, you're putting me
in a difficult situation.

09:12.306 --> 09:13.323
You know, I think
the world of you, but--

09:13.407 --> 09:14.407
So what's
the problem?

09:14.475 --> 09:16.493
Michael Westen
is the problem.

09:16.577 --> 09:18.478
Half my clients
are terrified of you.

09:18.529 --> 09:19.746
If they found out
you're on my payroll--

09:19.813 --> 09:24.167
Well, then hide me
in the back office.

09:24.252 --> 09:27.170
Roger, please.
I'm--I'm desperate.

09:27.255 --> 09:30.290
Mike, listen.
I can't give you a job.

09:32.510 --> 09:34.127
There's no way
I'm gonna leave you hanging.

09:34.178 --> 09:35.712
I mean, it--it--
how much do you need

09:35.796 --> 09:37.547
to get back
on your feet?

09:37.632 --> 09:39.266
Is 10,000 enough?
20,000?

09:39.333 --> 09:42.469
- I don't want a handout.
- No, this is not a handout.

09:42.520 --> 09:44.271
Call it a payback
for that thing in Ramadi.

09:44.338 --> 09:45.498
I won't take no
for an answer.

09:47.007 --> 09:48.475
Ah.

09:48.526 --> 09:51.728
There you are, just in time.
Hello, darling.

09:51.812 --> 09:55.899
Why don't we go down to the pool
and grill some steaks?

09:55.983 --> 09:57.734
Hm.

09:57.818 --> 09:59.686
So how was the tour?

10:01.021 --> 10:02.322
The security out here
is nothing

10:02.373 --> 10:04.691
compared to what's inside.

10:04.742 --> 10:06.693
This place
is a fortress.

10:06.744 --> 10:08.461
And you?

10:08.529 --> 10:11.197
He won't hire a spy
with my baggage,

10:11.249 --> 10:12.799
not even a friend.

10:12.866 --> 10:15.669
Not gonna be able
to get close to him.

10:15.720 --> 10:17.971
Well, we can't hit him
inside this compound.

10:18.038 --> 10:20.640
We'll have
to do it outside.

10:20.708 --> 10:22.759
What are you thinking?

10:22.843 --> 10:24.544
The road in and out
is narrow.

10:24.595 --> 10:25.762
His cars are armored,

10:25.846 --> 10:27.514
so we'll have to hit hard
and fast,

10:27.565 --> 10:30.517
put him down
before his security can react.

10:30.568 --> 10:32.485
Unless you see
another way?

10:32.553 --> 10:34.387
No, no, no.
Sounds like a plan.

10:35.940 --> 10:39.743
And who wants
some lovely champagne?

10:39.827 --> 10:42.579
- Wow.
- Here you go.

10:42.663 --> 10:44.331
Here you go.
Thank you.

10:44.398 --> 10:45.532
Raise them up,
you two.

10:45.583 --> 10:46.750
A toast.

10:46.834 --> 10:49.119
To old friends.

10:49.203 --> 10:50.837
And new ones.

10:50.904 --> 10:54.073
<i>Slainte.</i>

11:12.259 --> 11:14.060
Welcome to
my old neighborhood.

11:14.111 --> 11:16.646
It's charming.

11:16.731 --> 11:18.698
Yeah, I told you
you didn't have to come.

11:18.766 --> 11:20.099
Who's inside?

11:20.151 --> 11:22.319
This guy Mateo.

11:22.403 --> 11:23.770
I used to run with him
when I was a kid.

11:23.821 --> 11:26.323
He kind of runs
the neighborhood now.

11:26.407 --> 11:27.290
But if there's something
going on,

11:27.375 --> 11:29.125
he's gonna know
about it.

11:29.210 --> 11:30.943
Are those your friends too?

11:30.995 --> 11:32.275
They're with
the Latin syndicate.

11:32.279 --> 11:33.380
When you're a kid,
and you grow up here,

11:33.447 --> 11:34.381
you're kind of a part
of the gang

11:34.448 --> 11:35.999
whether you like it
or not.

11:36.083 --> 11:37.300
Look, I'm sorry, okay,

11:37.385 --> 11:39.386
that I didn't tell you
about this.

11:39.453 --> 11:41.254
I just--
I don't know.

11:41.305 --> 11:43.173
When I got out,
I never looked back.

11:43.257 --> 11:45.308
Hey, believe me,
I understand.

11:45.393 --> 11:47.177
And so you wait in the car.
I'll go talk to 'em.

11:47.261 --> 11:50.847
Oh, you think it's safer
leaving me out here?

11:50.931 --> 11:54.067
Let's go.

11:57.104 --> 11:59.806
What you need, homey?

11:59.857 --> 12:03.142
I'm here
to see Mateo.

12:03.194 --> 12:06.613
I think you got
the wrong house.

12:06.664 --> 12:08.948
LSG.

12:08.999 --> 12:09.866
Tell him
Car-Loco's here.

12:24.432 --> 12:28.334
- Car-Loco.
- Mateo.

12:30.688 --> 12:33.690
Mateo, what a surprise.

12:33.774 --> 12:35.225
Who is
this sexy thing?

12:35.309 --> 12:37.277
This is
my girl, Fiona.

12:38.979 --> 12:40.613
So how
you been, Mateo?

12:40.681 --> 12:41.948
Well, you know.

12:42.015 --> 12:43.733
We can't all leave the hood,
go to college,

12:43.818 --> 12:45.869
and come back
with a model chick.

12:45.953 --> 12:47.704
But we make out
all right.

12:47.788 --> 12:49.522
Hey, come on,
I still have family here.

12:49.573 --> 12:50.573
I didn't turn
my back on--

12:50.624 --> 12:52.909
Hey, Car-Loco.

12:52.993 --> 12:54.961
We're proud
of you, man.

12:55.028 --> 12:56.746
You made it
to the other side.

12:56.831 --> 12:59.082
Well, I appreciate that.

12:59.166 --> 13:00.166
All right,
so check it,

13:00.217 --> 13:01.367
I came down
'cause some guys

13:01.419 --> 13:02.886
rolled by my mom's house
looking for me.

13:02.970 --> 13:05.221
It sounded like
there was some trouble.

13:05.306 --> 13:06.266
Yeah, I heard
about that.

13:06.307 --> 13:09.225
- What was it?
- It's Nando.

13:09.310 --> 13:11.728
He knows, man.

13:11.812 --> 13:12.979
What does
he know?

13:13.046 --> 13:15.882
He knows you snitched on him
back in '03.

13:15.933 --> 13:18.651
Got him busted
for that coke deal.

13:18.719 --> 13:22.238
Put him on ice
for 10 years.

13:22.323 --> 13:24.941
He got a bounty
on your head.

13:30.948 --> 13:32.499
All right, well,
we're gonna get outta here.

13:32.566 --> 13:35.234
It's good seeing you.
You look good.

13:35.286 --> 13:37.236
We're gonna bounce,
all right?

13:37.288 --> 13:40.089
We gotta go.

13:40.174 --> 13:41.295
I can't let
you do that, man.

13:44.712 --> 13:48.181
I wish you would've stayed
out of the hood, papi.

13:48.248 --> 13:50.266
I really do.

13:50.351 --> 13:53.219
- You can't do this.
- Bro, I have to do this.

13:53.270 --> 13:55.021
You got any idea what Nando
would do to me

13:55.088 --> 13:56.105
if I let you go?

13:56.190 --> 13:58.858
What he would do
to my family?

13:58.926 --> 14:00.593
I'm sorry, bro.

14:00.644 --> 14:01.728
You should've
thought about that

14:01.779 --> 14:03.613
before you became a <i>rata.</i>

14:08.619 --> 14:09.602
Don't even
try it, homey.

14:09.653 --> 14:10.937
Nando wants you alive,

14:10.988 --> 14:12.205
but he'll
take you dead.

14:12.272 --> 14:15.274
Oh, my God.
Carlos!

14:15.326 --> 14:17.109
Please don't hurt him.
Please, please!

14:17.161 --> 14:18.711
Oh, my God!
Back off, bitch.

14:18.779 --> 14:20.747
Listen...

14:20.798 --> 14:21.965
I said
listen to me!

14:24.251 --> 14:25.668
Drop your guns
or you'll be

14:25.753 --> 14:27.837
scraping his brains
off your shoes.

14:27.922 --> 14:29.305
Do it!

14:32.259 --> 14:33.510
All right,
Mateo here

14:33.594 --> 14:35.812
is gonna be walking us
to our car.

14:35.896 --> 14:38.431
You move, he dies.

14:38.482 --> 14:40.650
Questions?
Let's go.

14:46.771 --> 14:50.123
Carlos, I want you
to know I'm--

14:50.208 --> 14:51.074
I'm so sorry
about all this.

14:51.125 --> 14:52.492
Mm.

14:52.577 --> 14:54.878
How the hell did this happen,
Detective Holloway?

14:54.945 --> 14:57.381
Nando was supposed to be
put away till 2040.

14:57.448 --> 14:58.465
He threw money
at lawyers

14:58.549 --> 15:00.116
until one of 'em found
a technicality.

15:00.168 --> 15:02.169
The American justice system
at its finest.

15:02.253 --> 15:03.887
But that still
doesn't explain

15:03.954 --> 15:05.806
why he's coming after you
all of a sudden.

15:05.890 --> 15:07.457
How does a 10-year-old
anonymous tip

15:07.508 --> 15:08.468
become public knowledge?

15:08.509 --> 15:10.394
I can't prove it,

15:10.461 --> 15:12.962
but I hear Nando paid off
a dirty D.A.

15:13.014 --> 15:15.899
to get access
to the sealed case file.

15:15.966 --> 15:18.935
Jeez, that's the one
with my name in it.

15:18.987 --> 15:21.188
Okay, so what the hell
do I do now?

15:21.272 --> 15:22.432
Help us get
the son of a bitch

15:22.440 --> 15:23.940
for something else,
like murder.

15:26.310 --> 15:27.527
Carlos, listen to me.

15:27.612 --> 15:29.246
Those drugs you got Nando
caught with?

15:29.313 --> 15:30.330
Those were stolen
from a courier

15:30.415 --> 15:31.496
from the Tenth Street gang,

15:31.499 --> 15:33.149
a courier
Nando killed.

15:33.201 --> 15:34.562
Now, I know it was
a long time ago,

15:34.619 --> 15:36.703
but I remember you saying
you might know someone

15:36.788 --> 15:39.122
who saw it go down.

15:42.010 --> 15:43.210
Carlos.

15:43.294 --> 15:45.662
I didn't mention it
because I can't.

15:45.713 --> 15:48.348
Look, I spent the last decade
protecting him.

15:48.433 --> 15:50.684
I cannot ask him
to testify now.

15:50.768 --> 15:52.552
Nando's only got more powerful
in prison.

15:52.637 --> 15:54.855
You need him off the streets
for good.

15:54.939 --> 15:56.056
And getting this witness
to testify,

15:56.140 --> 15:59.693
that's how
you do it.

16:01.029 --> 16:03.280
If that's what
it takes...

16:03.347 --> 16:05.365
All right.

16:05.450 --> 16:07.200
I'll see
what I can do.

16:07.285 --> 16:10.454
You want us to go down
to Ninth and Lakewood

16:10.521 --> 16:11.705
to find
this guy Lloyd,

16:11.789 --> 16:14.357
who witnessed a murder
ten years ago?

16:14.409 --> 16:15.542
You realize the cops
don't even go

16:15.626 --> 16:16.860
to that neighborhood, right?

16:16.911 --> 16:18.245
I know it's a lot
to ask.

16:18.329 --> 16:19.379
But we got into
a little trouble.

16:19.464 --> 16:20.580
Yeah.

16:20.665 --> 16:22.132
Look, we show our faces
in that area,

16:22.199 --> 16:24.000
we might as well turn ourselves
over to Nando.

16:24.001 --> 16:25.252
Okay, so this witness
you have to talk to,

16:25.336 --> 16:26.553
you can't just call
the guy?

16:26.637 --> 16:28.138
I tried, Sam,
he's not answering my calls.

16:28.205 --> 16:29.222
Of course not.

16:29.307 --> 16:30.428
So he won't even
talk to you,

16:30.475 --> 16:31.475
but we're supposed
to go down there

16:31.542 --> 16:32.709
and get him to come
with us?

16:32.760 --> 16:33.844
And this is supposed
to happen when?

16:33.895 --> 16:35.228
Yesterday.

16:35.313 --> 16:36.430
Right.

16:36.514 --> 16:38.398
We wouldn't be asking
if it were easy.

16:41.018 --> 16:43.687
Sorry.
Carlos, we got your back.

16:43.738 --> 16:45.238
Don't even worry
about it, man.

16:45.323 --> 16:46.656
You shouldn't have to pay
for doing the right thing.

16:46.724 --> 16:49.493
Jesse's right.
This one's on us.

16:49.560 --> 16:50.744
Drinks are on you.

16:52.780 --> 16:54.114
See ya.

16:59.537 --> 17:00.871
When you're
in the field,

17:00.922 --> 17:03.573
having direct contact
with your control officer

17:03.624 --> 17:06.075
is supposed to be
a last resort.

17:06.127 --> 17:08.627
The risk of being seen together
is enormous.

17:08.713 --> 17:11.631
If something goes wrong,
people die.

17:11.715 --> 17:13.517
If you're willing
to take that risk,

17:13.584 --> 17:15.435
everyone knows
it's serious.

17:15.520 --> 17:17.753
What the hell is this?
You want to meet now?

17:17.805 --> 17:19.222
In the middle of an Op?
We need to talk.

17:19.272 --> 17:21.474
This job,
it's a kill mission.

17:21.559 --> 17:22.692
I see.
Who's the target?

17:22.760 --> 17:25.529
Roger Steele.
You know who that is?

17:25.596 --> 17:27.396
Yeah, the Agency used him
as a go-between

17:27.448 --> 17:28.565
on a job
I did in Cyprus.

17:28.616 --> 17:30.099
Why does Kendrick
want him dead?

17:30.151 --> 17:31.318
Roger's been
tracking me.

17:31.402 --> 17:32.536
They're concerned
he might figure out

17:32.603 --> 17:33.620
who I'm working with.

17:33.704 --> 17:34.738
What am
I doing here?

17:34.789 --> 17:35.910
Do you want
a supportive hug?

17:35.940 --> 17:37.374
Strong, I'm supposed
to be outside

17:37.441 --> 17:39.292
Roger's house
in an hour,

17:39.377 --> 17:41.211
hitting him on the road
as he leaves.

17:41.278 --> 17:42.462
Okay, I get it.

17:42.547 --> 17:44.113
You want me to send in a team,
sweep him up,

17:44.165 --> 17:45.332
so you don't have
to pull the trigger.

17:45.416 --> 17:46.282
Yeah, something
like that.

17:46.334 --> 17:47.918
Michael, think about it.

17:47.969 --> 17:49.953
If you're Sonya and your target
suddenly vanishes,

17:50.004 --> 17:51.922
are you gonna just chalk that up
to bad luck?

17:51.973 --> 17:52.889
Hell no.

17:52.957 --> 17:54.758
We grab Steele,

17:54.809 --> 17:55.842
we might as well
pull you out too

17:55.927 --> 17:57.477
because this mission
would be over.

17:57.562 --> 17:58.883
You're asking me
to kill a friend.

17:58.930 --> 18:01.297
He's in the game.
He knows how it's played.

18:01.349 --> 18:03.299
And need I remind you

18:03.351 --> 18:04.518
he makes a living
selling intelligence

18:04.602 --> 18:05.902
to the highest bidder.

18:05.970 --> 18:07.938
Sometimes, that intelligence
gets spies killed.

18:07.989 --> 18:11.274
And sometimes, those spies
are not the bad guy.

18:11.325 --> 18:15.144
Look, when I gave you
this assignment,

18:15.196 --> 18:16.780
I said I needed
the Michael Westen

18:16.831 --> 18:19.666
who was willing
to do what?

18:19.750 --> 18:20.817
Whatever it takes.

18:20.868 --> 18:24.621
Well, this is
what it takes.

18:35.132 --> 18:37.333
We got movement
at the gate.

18:37.385 --> 18:39.186
You ready?

18:39.270 --> 18:41.354
Bomb's in place.
Tell me when.

18:41.439 --> 18:44.140
They're on the road now,
two SUVs.

18:44.192 --> 18:46.776
Steele's in
the lead vehicle.

18:46.844 --> 18:51.481
Moving into position now.

18:51.532 --> 18:53.650
All right.
Ready to go.

18:53.701 --> 18:54.701
Arm the detonator.

18:54.785 --> 18:58.038
Armed.

18:58.122 --> 19:01.791
Both SUVs are headed
your way.

19:04.045 --> 19:05.629
Now remember:
Do not move un--

19:05.696 --> 19:09.299
Until you disable the car.
I know.

19:09.366 --> 19:11.868
Roadside improvised
explosive devices

19:11.919 --> 19:13.503
come in
many varieties.

19:13.554 --> 19:16.372
But they usually share
basic features.

19:16.424 --> 19:18.758
Once a target vehicle
is chosen,

19:18.843 --> 19:22.312
an explosive device is planted
in the vehicle's path

19:22.379 --> 19:24.648
and then detonated
by remote control

19:24.715 --> 19:26.716
as soon as the vehicle
is in position.

19:28.385 --> 19:30.487
Of course, that assumes
that your target

19:30.554 --> 19:32.221
isn't using
a signal jammer.

19:32.273 --> 19:33.890
- Michael.
- Sonya.

19:33.941 --> 19:35.391
Sonya, come in!

19:35.443 --> 19:37.027
The problem
with signal jammers

19:37.078 --> 19:38.828
is they don't
just make it impossible

19:38.896 --> 19:40.614
to remotely trigger
a detonator.

19:40.698 --> 19:42.365
They also
make it impossible

19:42.416 --> 19:44.734
to communicate
with your team.

19:44.785 --> 19:46.419
And when
you can't communicate,

19:46.504 --> 19:47.704
bad things
usually happen.

20:18.268 --> 20:20.937
Get in.

20:44.345 --> 20:45.645
The guy Carlos
needs to talk to

20:45.730 --> 20:46.963
lives in 4C.

20:47.014 --> 20:48.932
Not a place that takes kindly
to strangers.

20:48.983 --> 20:50.734
That's what we got
the cover for, Sam.

20:50.801 --> 20:52.352
Hopefully,
they'll give us a pass,

20:52.436 --> 20:54.137
since, technically,
we're here to help.

20:57.575 --> 20:59.943
How you doin', ma'am?
Don't wanna scare ya.

20:59.994 --> 21:00.860
We're with
the health department.

21:00.945 --> 21:02.662
Please read that.

21:02.747 --> 21:04.614
Hey, how are ya, sir?
Check that out.

21:04.665 --> 21:05.815
How are ya, folks?

21:05.866 --> 21:07.167
We're with
the health department.

21:07.251 --> 21:08.451
I'm sure you heard about
the refinery spill

21:08.502 --> 21:09.669
over at Sunco.

21:09.754 --> 21:11.338
Some hydro carbic toxins
were released.

21:11.422 --> 21:12.543
Yeah, we just wanna
make sure

21:12.623 --> 21:13.656
that no one
was exposed.

21:13.708 --> 21:14.958
How's everybody feelin'?

21:15.009 --> 21:16.593
- Any rashes?
- Nausea?

21:16.660 --> 21:17.820
- Burning eyes?
- Loose stool?

21:17.828 --> 21:18.828
Nah, dude.
That's nasty.

21:18.879 --> 21:20.013
Yeah.
Yeah, it is nasty.

21:20.097 --> 21:21.464
It's nasty
and it's deadly.

21:21.515 --> 21:23.515
So if you feel anything,
you make sure you call us.

21:23.551 --> 21:24.834
Okay?
All right.

21:24.885 --> 21:28.138
- Examine yourselves.
- Have a blessed day.

21:30.224 --> 21:31.674
Hi.
Health department.

21:31.726 --> 21:34.010
Can we come in?
How come?

21:34.061 --> 21:36.229
Uh, just a quick check
for toxic gas.

21:36.313 --> 21:39.015
Won't take
a minute.

21:39.066 --> 21:42.035
- Come on.
- Thank you.

21:42.119 --> 21:43.653
Yeah, I don't know
what the problem is,

21:43.704 --> 21:46.355
but I haven't heard anything
about a gas leak.

21:46.407 --> 21:48.491
Uh, well, sir, see,
we're actually

21:48.542 --> 21:50.076
not with
the health department.

21:50.161 --> 21:51.494
We just had
to talk to you

21:51.545 --> 21:53.529
without raising too many
eyebrows in this area.

21:53.581 --> 21:54.497
We're friends
of Carlos Cruz.

21:54.548 --> 21:55.749
What?
What, wait, no.

21:55.833 --> 21:57.200
No, I told him on the phone--
We know.

21:57.251 --> 21:59.469
The thing is, the guy
that's coming after Carlos,

21:59.536 --> 22:01.037
he's gonna be coming after you
before too long.

22:01.088 --> 22:02.172
We wanna take you
someplace safe,

22:02.223 --> 22:03.372
someplace you can talk
to the cops.

22:03.424 --> 22:04.974
No, no way.
Just get out.

22:05.042 --> 22:06.375
Lloyd, we're on
your side.

22:06.427 --> 22:08.377
I said get out!
Get out!

22:12.400 --> 22:14.517
Stop fighting.
Stop fighting.

22:14.568 --> 22:15.985
Stop fighting.
Stop fighting!

22:16.053 --> 22:17.103
Stop fighting.

22:17.188 --> 22:18.822
Stop.
Jesse.

22:18.889 --> 22:21.891
- What?
- He stopped fighting.

22:21.942 --> 22:23.827
Whaoh.
Aw.

22:23.894 --> 22:26.029
Crap.
He's out cold.

22:26.080 --> 22:29.532
I barely even--
what now?

22:29.583 --> 22:31.034
Everybody make way.

22:31.085 --> 22:32.252
This man has had
a seizure.

22:32.336 --> 22:33.420
- Read your brochures, people.
- What'd I say?

22:33.504 --> 22:34.337
Serious business.

22:37.012 --> 22:37.961
No, no way.

22:37.962 --> 22:39.179
I told you
I can't.

22:39.264 --> 22:40.514
I-I-I'm not talking
to the cops.

22:40.598 --> 22:42.232
Lloyd, you're
the only one

22:42.300 --> 22:44.318
that can get Nando
off the street.

22:44.402 --> 22:45.736
You have
to step up.

22:45.803 --> 22:47.404
What I gotta do is
I gotta get out of town, right?

22:47.471 --> 22:49.306
Look, look, they could be
on their way here right now.

22:49.357 --> 22:51.575
We got out
of the neighborhood clean.

22:51.642 --> 22:54.411
Sam and Jesse are keeping
watch outside just in case.

22:54.478 --> 22:55.579
Youwait, you mean
the two guys that--

22:55.646 --> 22:56.646
that took me out
and kidnapped me?

22:56.698 --> 22:58.148
Those two?

22:58.199 --> 23:02.035
Lloyd, I'm sorry

23:02.120 --> 23:04.087
for how this whole thing
went down.

23:04.155 --> 23:05.822
But it's time you do
the right thing.

23:05.874 --> 23:07.758
Now, I wouldn't
ask you

23:07.825 --> 23:09.259
if there was
any other way.

23:09.327 --> 23:12.162
But if you stay quiet,
if you do nothing,

23:12.213 --> 23:14.164
Nando will
find you, eventually.

23:14.215 --> 23:15.549
And if you run,

23:15.633 --> 23:17.100
you put your whole family
in danger.

23:17.168 --> 23:19.353
You don't understand, man.

23:19.437 --> 23:21.671
I've seen what Nando does
to guys that cross him.

23:21.723 --> 23:23.690
That's not gonna be me!
So what are you gonna do?

23:23.775 --> 23:25.025
You gonna let him
walk free?

23:25.109 --> 23:27.677
You gonna give him a free pass
because you're afraid?

23:27.729 --> 23:30.197
Carlos, can I just
say something?

23:30.281 --> 23:32.115
Please.

23:32.183 --> 23:34.651
Look, I'm sorry.
You--I don't even know you.

23:34.702 --> 23:37.204
And this is probably
none of my business.

23:37.288 --> 23:39.823
But I do know
what it's like

23:39.874 --> 23:44.411
to be afraid
of doing the right thing.

23:44.495 --> 23:48.832
I've been there for years.

23:48.883 --> 23:54.221
And, um...
If you don't do this...

23:54.305 --> 23:55.556
You're gonna spend
the rest of your life

23:55.640 --> 23:57.808
knowing that the blood
of every person

23:57.875 --> 24:03.564
this man hurt
is on your hands.

24:03.648 --> 24:07.150
Just think about it.

24:07.218 --> 24:09.219
It's all right.

24:17.561 --> 24:19.029
All right.

24:19.080 --> 24:22.282
Carlos, tell your cop friend
I want a deal, in writing--

24:22.367 --> 24:25.168
protection for me
and my family.

24:28.039 --> 24:30.424
I'll make it happen.

24:32.844 --> 24:34.878
When a plan goes wrong
in the field,

24:34.929 --> 24:37.798
the job is
rarely abandoned entirely.

24:37.882 --> 24:39.850
The goals of the mission
don't change.

24:39.917 --> 24:41.468
The methods do.

24:41.552 --> 24:43.420
Destroy the cell phones,
anything traceable.

24:43.471 --> 24:45.138
We leave
in one hour.

24:45.223 --> 24:46.857
The problem
is backup plans

24:46.924 --> 24:48.758
are usually that
for a reason.

24:48.810 --> 24:50.444
They tend to be
a lot messier

24:50.528 --> 24:52.195
and a lot
more deadly.

24:52.263 --> 24:55.098
Sonya, what are you doin'?
I'm finishing our mission.

24:55.149 --> 24:56.283
I don't know if you were
paying attention back there,

24:56.367 --> 24:57.451
but we failed.

24:57.535 --> 24:58.935
Calling in
an air strike.

24:58.987 --> 25:01.188
They'll hit the compound
with a bomb from high altitude.

25:01.239 --> 25:02.906
An air strike? Do you know
how many people that will kill?

25:02.957 --> 25:04.708
All the guards,
all the staff--

25:04.775 --> 25:06.776
I don't like it
either, Michael.

25:06.828 --> 25:10.831
But we don't get
to fail.

25:10.915 --> 25:13.300
Wait.
I-I have a better idea.

25:13.384 --> 25:15.618
- I don't have time for it.
- Sonya, listen to me.

25:15.670 --> 25:17.170
Stop.
Listen--stop!

25:17.255 --> 25:19.122
All of those people
don't have to die

25:19.173 --> 25:20.557
to kill one man.

25:20.624 --> 25:22.476
Hear me out.

25:22.560 --> 25:24.895
- I'm listening.
- Let me call Roger.

25:24.962 --> 25:27.314
I can finish this
with a sniper rifle.

25:27.398 --> 25:29.799
One shot, one body.

25:29.851 --> 25:32.102
Give me an hour.

25:32.153 --> 25:34.304
Fine.
You have one hour.

25:38.076 --> 25:40.944
- Yes, who is this?
- Roger, it's--it's Michael.

25:40.995 --> 25:42.279
I-I-I-we need
to talk.

25:42.330 --> 25:45.248
I'm in a sticky situation.
I need your help.

25:45.316 --> 25:46.649
I don't have
the time, Michael.

25:46.701 --> 25:48.335
I've got a situation
of my own.

25:48.419 --> 25:51.755
Hold on, there are some men
who came after me.

25:51.822 --> 25:54.374
Men in masks, they tried
to kill me on the street.

25:54.459 --> 25:56.593
- Wait, black masks?
- Yeah.

25:56.660 --> 25:58.679
Was it a two-man hit team
packing MP5ks?

25:58.763 --> 26:00.797
Yeah, two men--
yes, yes.

26:00.848 --> 26:02.849
Jesus, Michael.
The same guys came after me.

26:02.934 --> 26:04.351
- What?
- Where are you?

26:04.435 --> 26:08.438
I'll get my guys together.
I'll be right there.

26:08.506 --> 26:11.141
We're in an abandoned factory
on Loma Vista Avenue.

26:11.192 --> 26:13.060
It's a white,
two-story building.

26:13.144 --> 26:15.145
I think the best approach
is from the south.

26:15.196 --> 26:16.563
Loma Vista Avenue.

26:16.647 --> 26:17.698
Don't worry, Michael.
I'll be there.

26:17.782 --> 26:19.316
Just stay alive
until I do.

26:19.367 --> 26:22.986
We'll do our best.
I think we have ten minutes.

26:26.374 --> 26:29.960
As a spy, you have to get used
to deception.

26:30.027 --> 26:31.861
Your job is to engage
with people,

26:31.913 --> 26:34.548
make them your friends,
manipulate them,

26:34.632 --> 26:37.634
and ultimately
destroy them.

26:37.701 --> 26:40.003
It's one thing to do it
to your enemies.

26:40.054 --> 26:41.338
You can think
of your target

26:41.389 --> 26:43.256
in terms
that aren't exactly human,

26:43.341 --> 26:45.842
like,
mission objectives.

26:48.712 --> 26:50.063
He's here.

26:50.148 --> 26:51.681
But when the target
is a friend,

26:51.733 --> 26:53.900
it doesn't matter
what you tell yourself.

26:53.985 --> 26:55.769
It feels
like betrayal.

26:58.072 --> 26:59.689
Roger, it's Michael.

26:59.741 --> 27:00.857
Michael, it's me.
I'm here.

27:00.908 --> 27:02.826
I'm at the south side
with my men.

27:02.893 --> 27:05.695
Tell me
where you are.

27:05.747 --> 27:07.280
Where are you?
I don't see the team?

27:07.365 --> 27:10.567
- I'm--I can't...
- Get in the building now.

27:10.618 --> 27:13.370
Stay with me.
Go!

27:13.421 --> 27:15.405
Take the shot.

27:15.456 --> 27:18.542
Michael?

27:18.593 --> 27:21.962
Michael?

27:22.046 --> 27:25.182
Michael, take the shot.

27:25.249 --> 27:28.418
Michael, you still there?

27:28.469 --> 27:31.471
I'm here, Roger.

27:31.556 --> 27:34.191
And I'm sorry.

28:00.418 --> 28:02.502
Okay, Lloyd.
Here's how this works.

28:02.587 --> 28:04.547
Carlos is gonna meet
the detective, make the deal.

28:04.555 --> 28:05.955
Then, we're gonna take you
over there, okay?

28:06.007 --> 28:07.128
You don't have
to go anywhere

28:07.175 --> 28:08.975
till Carlos gives
the high sign.

28:14.098 --> 28:17.734
- How's it lookin', Fi?
- He just arrived.

28:17.801 --> 28:20.237
Detective Holloway too.

28:20.304 --> 28:22.105
Right on time.
Okay, see?

28:22.156 --> 28:24.608
They'll sort it out.
Everything's gonna be just fine.

28:24.659 --> 28:26.476
Yeah, well, you just make sure
you keep those guns ready.

28:26.527 --> 28:29.479
I'll believe it
when I see it.

28:33.835 --> 28:35.752
Hey, Detective.
Thanks for coming.

28:35.819 --> 28:38.338
Of course.

28:38.422 --> 28:39.956
Where's my witness?

28:40.007 --> 28:42.292
I talked to him,
and he says that he'll testify,

28:42.343 --> 28:46.012
but he has conditions.
Conditions?

28:46.097 --> 28:47.764
What conditions?
He wants Witness Protection.

28:47.831 --> 28:49.999
He wants a signed agreement
from the D.A.

28:50.051 --> 28:51.101
before he shows
his face.

28:51.168 --> 28:53.220
- The DA?
- I'm sorry, Detective.

28:53.304 --> 28:54.638
But that's how it's gotta be.
He's nervous.

28:54.689 --> 28:56.356
You understand.

28:56.440 --> 28:59.359
- Everything all right, Fi?
- Well, she's not thrilled.

28:59.443 --> 29:02.345
Carlos will take care
of it.

29:05.566 --> 29:07.046
- Who's this?
- It--it doesn't matter.

29:07.118 --> 29:09.486
The question is:
Where is the witness right now?

29:09.537 --> 29:10.687
Who's that?

29:12.990 --> 29:17.661
I don't know.
Another detective, maybe?

29:17.712 --> 29:20.530
You've gotta be kidding me.

29:20.581 --> 29:24.084
Carloco.

29:24.168 --> 29:26.836
Man, I am so happy
to see you.

29:26.888 --> 29:28.388
How long
has it been?

29:28.472 --> 29:30.373
Oh, yeah.
Ten years.

29:30.424 --> 29:32.509
- Fi, what's happening?
- I can't see.

29:32.560 --> 29:35.878
That SUV's blocking
my view.

29:35.930 --> 29:37.880
So you were the one
that blew my cover.

29:37.932 --> 29:39.349
It's nothing personal, Carlos.
Just business.

29:39.400 --> 29:40.920
You were a goddamn traitor
to your ba--

29:40.985 --> 29:42.686
Shut up.

29:46.357 --> 29:49.776
- Where's my witness?
- He didn't--

29:49.860 --> 29:51.728
there was a problem.

29:51.779 --> 29:52.662
A problem?
What does that mean?

29:52.730 --> 29:54.698
I don't
like problems.

29:54.749 --> 29:56.583
Fi, can you tell what the hell
is goin' on?

29:56.667 --> 30:00.036
I still can't see Carlos.
Maybe we should go in.

30:00.087 --> 30:01.404
Look, we had a deal.

30:01.455 --> 30:03.173
I paid you good money
to deliver me

30:03.240 --> 30:05.125
this rat
and a witness.

30:05.209 --> 30:06.760
Look, I did everything
I could, okay?

30:06.844 --> 30:07.677
It's not my fault
he didn't show up.

30:07.745 --> 30:08.929
It's not?

30:09.013 --> 30:10.096
Bitch, you told me
you'd pull through.

30:10.181 --> 30:12.182
Watch your tone.

30:12.249 --> 30:15.585
I could still arrest your ass
any day of the week.

30:15.636 --> 30:18.772
Are you threatening me?

30:18.856 --> 30:20.523
Are you threatening me?
Just back off.

30:23.093 --> 30:26.363
What the hell
was that?

30:26.430 --> 30:27.697
Nando.

30:27.765 --> 30:28.865
That wasn't part of the deal!

30:28.932 --> 30:31.067
Lloyd.
Lloyd!

30:31.118 --> 30:35.322
Get him in the car.
Let's go.

30:35.406 --> 30:36.206
They're taking Carlos.
We gotta follow 'em.

30:37.875 --> 30:40.910
- I'm driving.
- Oh, boy.

30:50.118 --> 30:51.571
I don't know, guys.

30:51.572 --> 30:53.155
Well, I guess we could try
taking a run at it, but--

30:53.240 --> 30:54.457
It's a gang HQ, Sam.

30:54.541 --> 30:55.701
Everybody in there
is packing.

30:55.709 --> 30:56.989
We can't just go in
all commando.

30:57.044 --> 30:58.878
We might as well
shoot ourselves in the head

30:58.945 --> 31:01.464
and save Nando
the trouble.

31:01.548 --> 31:02.781
I think
it's cop time.

31:02.833 --> 31:04.116
Jesse, the whole
problem is

31:04.167 --> 31:05.887
is that Carlos knows Nando
murdered someone.

31:05.919 --> 31:07.253
If we call the cops,
he's dead for sure.

31:07.304 --> 31:08.337
I'm not saying
I like it.

31:08.422 --> 31:10.456
I just don't see
another way.

31:12.926 --> 31:14.627
It's Carlos's phone.

31:14.678 --> 31:16.896
Hello?
Is this Fiona?

31:16.963 --> 31:18.180
Nando.

31:18.265 --> 31:20.349
I got your number
from a mutual friend.

31:20.434 --> 31:22.852
I'm having a barbecue
in his honor.

31:22.936 --> 31:25.855
He wants to say hi.

31:28.158 --> 31:30.643
What are you--
stop it!

31:30.694 --> 31:31.861
You want it
to stop?

31:31.945 --> 31:34.247
Oh, you can
make it stop anytime.

31:34.314 --> 31:36.982
All I want
is peace of mind.

31:37.034 --> 31:39.585
But Carlos here, he doesn't
want to give it to me.

31:39.653 --> 31:42.755
I want that witness.
So you can kill him?

31:42.822 --> 31:46.509
Better him
than Carlos.

31:46.593 --> 31:48.210
All right!

31:48.295 --> 31:50.215
I'll get you the witness.
Just give me some time.

31:50.264 --> 31:53.432
Oh, time? You got all the time
in the world.

31:53.500 --> 31:56.602
But Carlos here,
he's only got until 5:00.

32:00.440 --> 32:02.441
Uh, Fi,
did I hear you right?

32:02.509 --> 32:03.676
It sounded like
you just said

32:03.727 --> 32:05.311
you're gonna hand Lloyd over
to Nando.

32:05.362 --> 32:07.012
Nando is
torturing Carlos.

32:07.064 --> 32:09.282
I'm just trying
to buy us time.

32:09.349 --> 32:11.067
We have until 5:00.
5:00?

32:11.151 --> 32:12.535
That's an hour and 20 minutes
from now.

32:12.619 --> 32:13.703
What are we supposed to do
in that amount of time?

32:13.787 --> 32:15.688
I don't know, Sam!

32:20.377 --> 32:21.494
Maybe Michael does.

32:25.382 --> 32:27.166
Yeah?

32:27.217 --> 32:29.835
- It's me.
- Fi?

32:29.886 --> 32:31.003
Are you in Miami?

32:31.054 --> 32:32.254
We just got back.
What's wrong?

32:32.339 --> 32:34.056
Carlos is in trouble.

32:34.141 --> 32:35.508
I need your help.

32:35.559 --> 32:37.543
What can I do?

32:37.594 --> 32:38.877
I'm not sure.

32:38.929 --> 32:41.147
He's being held by a gangster
in South Miami.

32:41.214 --> 32:44.016
Maybe Sonya,
or the people she works with,

32:44.067 --> 32:45.384
or their resources?

32:45.435 --> 32:46.769
Sonya?

32:46.853 --> 32:50.940
I could ask her,
if that's really what you want.

32:51.024 --> 32:53.192
I don't see
another way.

32:53.243 --> 32:56.112
Tell me everything
I need to know.

33:03.086 --> 33:04.370
Did you talk
to Sonya?

33:04.421 --> 33:05.904
She's talking
to her people.

33:05.956 --> 33:07.289
They're working on it.
Working on it?

33:07.374 --> 33:08.624
What does that mean?
Can they deal with Nando or not?

33:08.709 --> 33:09.925
I think so.

33:10.010 --> 33:10.926
They're contacting
some of their people

33:11.011 --> 33:12.261
in the drug trade.

33:12.346 --> 33:14.547
They're gonna go above his head
to his supplier.

33:14.598 --> 33:16.015
- How long is that gonna take?
- I don't know.

33:16.082 --> 33:17.933
They're gonna call me
when they have something.

33:18.018 --> 33:19.602
Michael, Carlos is running
out of time.

33:19.686 --> 33:21.354
We just need to buy
a little more time.

33:21.421 --> 33:22.855
They'll come through.
Well, how can you be sure?

33:22.922 --> 33:24.757
Because they owe me.

33:24.808 --> 33:27.593
I did a job
for them that--

33:27.644 --> 33:29.111
they'll come through.

33:29.196 --> 33:30.479
Okay.
Practical question.

33:30.564 --> 33:34.116
How are we gonna buy Carlos
more time?

33:34.201 --> 33:35.735
He wants a witness?
Let's give him one.

33:35.786 --> 33:37.820
Mike, we don't even know
where Lloyd is.

33:37.904 --> 33:39.872
Nando's never
seen him, right?

33:39.939 --> 33:41.791
Take me in.
I'll be the witness.

33:41.875 --> 33:43.125
We can buy ourselves
some time with that.

33:43.210 --> 33:44.577
What if they don't go
for it?

33:44.628 --> 33:47.663
Then I'll have called in
that favor for nothing

33:47.748 --> 33:49.048
'cause we'll all
be dead.

34:05.649 --> 34:08.984
Fiona Glenanne.
Just in time.

34:09.069 --> 34:11.020
You got my witness?
Yes, I do.

34:11.103 --> 34:14.657
But I would prefer to hand him
to you myself, in person.

34:14.741 --> 34:16.659
Little girl,
you are in no position

34:16.743 --> 34:18.143
to make any demands.

34:18.195 --> 34:19.911
I think I am,
if you want your witness.

34:19.978 --> 34:21.947
You see, I have a gun
to his head,

34:21.998 --> 34:23.649
a head that contains
all the answers

34:23.699 --> 34:25.150
to your questions.

34:25.202 --> 34:26.534
So if you don't want
your answers

34:26.620 --> 34:27.920
splattered all over
the place,

34:27.987 --> 34:31.623
then let us in
right now.

34:42.853 --> 34:44.804
Carlos.

34:44.855 --> 34:46.856
Wake up.

34:46.940 --> 34:48.556
I wanna
show you something.

34:48.641 --> 34:50.192
You put up
with all that pain

34:50.277 --> 34:52.228
to protect a name.

34:52.312 --> 34:55.898
But now,
I don't need the name.

34:58.068 --> 34:59.568
You must be Fiona.

34:59.653 --> 35:02.187
Smart man.
You can let him go now.

35:02.239 --> 35:03.622
We'll see about that,

35:03.690 --> 35:05.858
'cause I think you might be
trying to play me.

35:05.909 --> 35:08.294
- Nando, you asked for--
- Shut up.

35:08.361 --> 35:10.579
So you're the <i>pendejo</i>
who saw me

35:10.664 --> 35:13.582
cap that dude
ten years ago, huh?

35:13.667 --> 35:15.050
Got to admit
it's kind of funny.

35:15.135 --> 35:16.802
Seems to me somebody
would've noticed

35:16.870 --> 35:20.205
a white boy like you hanging
around in little Managua.

35:20.257 --> 35:23.259
So I guess
the real question is:

35:23.343 --> 35:24.643
Who the hell
are you?

35:24.711 --> 35:27.229
'Cause my guess is
you ain't no witness.

35:27.314 --> 35:29.348
You're right, Nando.
I'm not a witness.

35:29.399 --> 35:30.716
I'm a messenger.

35:30.767 --> 35:32.151
And this is my message.

35:32.218 --> 35:33.352
You don't know
what you're up against.

35:33.403 --> 35:36.221
You have no idea
what you're up against.

35:36.273 --> 35:38.107
So I'm gonna give you
some advice.

35:38.191 --> 35:41.560
You let the three of us
go now.

35:41.611 --> 35:43.863
And when we're gone,
you leave town.

35:43.914 --> 35:46.365
And when I say leave,
I mean forever.

35:48.168 --> 35:50.369
This guy!

35:50.420 --> 35:52.588
I mean, I don't know
whether he's stupid,

35:52.672 --> 35:55.674
or crazy, or both?

35:55.742 --> 35:57.543
Some balls, though.

35:57.594 --> 35:58.961
Big talk
from an unarmed man

35:59.045 --> 36:00.963
with a 100-pound pixie
as his backup.

36:01.047 --> 36:03.883
- I have friends.
- Oh.

36:03.934 --> 36:06.936
You got friends, huh?
Chacho, he's got friends.

36:08.638 --> 36:10.523
Friends?

36:10.590 --> 36:13.559
Well, where are they?
Huh?

36:13.610 --> 36:16.261
Because I don't see
these friends of yours.

36:16.313 --> 36:17.980
You wanna know
what I think?

36:18.064 --> 36:19.865
I think
you got nothing.

36:19.933 --> 36:20.866
That's what
I think.

36:34.631 --> 36:36.582
What are
you laughing at, <i>loco?</i>

36:36.633 --> 36:40.803
You think I would walk in here
with nothing?

36:40.887 --> 36:44.256
Nando, Nando, Nando,
you're dead.

36:44.307 --> 36:47.226
You just
don't know it yet.

36:47.293 --> 36:48.894
Chacho, shoot
this fool.

36:53.633 --> 36:54.984
You might want
to answer that.

36:59.940 --> 37:04.326
Yo, who is this?

37:04.411 --> 37:05.477
Nando, you're not
gonna believe it.

37:05.528 --> 37:07.446
It's Lopez.

37:07.497 --> 37:09.498
<i>Cual Lopez?</i>

37:09.583 --> 37:12.167
Lopez from--
Colombia.

37:12.252 --> 37:15.537
He said to put him
on speaker.

37:15.622 --> 37:18.591
Ricardo.
<i>Que pasa?</i>

37:18.658 --> 37:21.010
Nando, forgive me
for interrupting.

37:21.094 --> 37:24.129
No, no, no, no.
No--no problem.

37:24.180 --> 37:25.998
What can I do?
What's going on?

37:26.049 --> 37:29.001
The man who owns this phone,
is he there?

37:29.052 --> 37:32.054
Is he alive?

37:32.138 --> 37:33.439
Yeah, he's fine.

37:33.506 --> 37:36.008
Good.
Listen to me carefully.

37:36.059 --> 37:37.610
You're going
to let him go,

37:37.677 --> 37:39.311
him and his friends.

37:39.362 --> 37:42.014
You understand?

37:42.065 --> 37:44.450
Ricardo, no.
I can't.

37:44.517 --> 37:46.535
Listen, you don't understand.

37:46.620 --> 37:49.038
These guys can pin
a murder on me.

37:49.122 --> 37:51.206
I have to handle it.
Don't worry, Nando.

37:51.291 --> 37:53.158
I'll handle it.

37:53.209 --> 37:55.544
Chacho, you know
who I am?

37:55.629 --> 37:58.414
What I can do?
To your <i>familia?</i>

37:58.498 --> 38:00.132
To you?

38:00.199 --> 38:01.834
Yes, sir, Mr. Lopez.

38:01.885 --> 38:04.369
So if I asked you
to do something,

38:04.421 --> 38:07.723
you would do it
no matter what, right?

38:07.807 --> 38:09.207
- Yes, sir.
- Ricardo, <i>por favor.</i>

38:09.259 --> 38:12.227
Shut up.
I'm talking to Chacho.

38:12.312 --> 38:16.315
Chacho, I want you
to shoot Nando now.

38:16.382 --> 38:18.567
What?
Ricardo,<i>por favor.</i>

38:18.652 --> 38:20.552
Chacho.

38:20.603 --> 38:23.605
Chacho!

38:23.690 --> 38:26.358
Thank you, Chacho.

38:26.409 --> 38:30.329
Now, make sure your guests
get home safely.

38:30.396 --> 38:34.900
Get them
out of here.

38:58.158 --> 39:00.209
I hear things worked out
for Fiona

39:00.277 --> 39:02.444
and her boyfriend.
What did you do?

39:02.496 --> 39:05.047
We put pressure
on a supplier,

39:05.115 --> 39:06.299
made them understand
it was in

39:06.383 --> 39:09.418
his best interest
to make a call.

39:09.470 --> 39:13.806
- Thank you.
- Of course.

39:13.891 --> 39:17.977
Michael, about this job
with your friend Steele.

39:18.061 --> 39:19.479
I know
it wasn't easy.

39:19.563 --> 39:22.565
He was a threat.
And it was necessary.

39:22.632 --> 39:24.817
Necessary for what?

39:26.770 --> 39:27.937
For everything.

39:27.988 --> 39:29.272
Michael, don't
you understand?

39:29.323 --> 39:31.190
You're part of this.

39:31.275 --> 39:33.442
James has plans for you,
big plans.

39:33.494 --> 39:37.830
What does that mean?

39:37.915 --> 39:39.198
You can
ask him yourself.

39:39.283 --> 39:42.251
He wants to see us
next week.

39:42.319 --> 39:44.086
Where? When?

39:44.154 --> 39:45.654
I'll know
the details soon.

39:45.706 --> 39:48.424
In the meantime,
why don't you get some rest?

39:48.491 --> 39:49.709
Okay?

39:49.793 --> 39:52.795
You've earned it.

40:07.177 --> 40:08.644
Carlos, what
are you doing?

40:08.695 --> 40:11.447
Fi, we need to talk.

40:17.871 --> 40:21.240
Fi, I'm moving out.

40:21.325 --> 40:22.992
I'm gonna go stay with a buddy
of mine for a while.

40:23.043 --> 40:26.546
I think it's best...

40:26.630 --> 40:30.917
For both of us.

40:31.001 --> 40:32.001
Does this have
anything to do

40:32.052 --> 40:32.919
with what happened
to Nando?

40:35.372 --> 40:38.474
Yeah.

40:38.541 --> 40:39.642
That call
that Michael got,

40:39.709 --> 40:44.146
you know why
that happened?

40:49.603 --> 40:53.222
Open it up.

40:53.273 --> 40:56.525
That's from a newspaper
in Bogota.

40:56.577 --> 41:00.279
Two days ago, at the exact
same time Nando got the call,

41:00.364 --> 41:02.031
a helicopter gun ship
opened fire

41:02.082 --> 41:05.251
on an estate
outside of Cartagena.

41:05.335 --> 41:06.902
You know who owned
that estate?

41:06.954 --> 41:11.874
Ricardo Lopez,
the same guy that called Nando.

41:11.925 --> 41:16.745
Seven people died, Fi.

41:16.797 --> 41:18.464
I was--
I was trying to save you.

41:18.548 --> 41:22.301
Ii...
And I thank you for that.

41:24.438 --> 41:25.605
But I'm gonna have to live
with that

41:25.689 --> 41:26.755
for the rest of my life
and wonder

41:26.807 --> 41:28.307
if it was all
worth it.

41:32.562 --> 41:35.531
I love you.

41:45.208 --> 41:48.794
I love you too, Fi.

41:48.879 --> 41:52.114
You're traveling a path
with Michael.

41:52.165 --> 41:56.085
You always have.

41:56.136 --> 41:59.255
I can't go down it
with you.

41:59.306 --> 42:01.424
I don't have a choice.

42:01.475 --> 42:05.594
Yes, you do.

42:05.646 --> 42:07.063
And you've made it.
