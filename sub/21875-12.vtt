00:01.830 --> 00:02.060
MAN:
Here he comes.

00:14.210 --> 00:15.610
Hey, man,

00:15.610 --> 00:17.580
we thought maybe
you wasn't gonna show.

00:17.580 --> 00:18.710
We got customers.

00:18.710 --> 00:21.250
Yeah and I got
what they want, so shut up.

00:21.250 --> 00:23.020
Whoa, whoa.
Take it easy.

00:45.470 --> 00:46.710
Good.

00:46.710 --> 00:48.680
Let's do it.

00:54.780 --> 01:00.790
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

01:07.700 --> 01:09.260
You ready?
Yeah.

01:09.270 --> 01:10.260
How are we
going to do it?

01:10.270 --> 01:11.730
Like this.

01:15.300 --> 01:18.070
( all shouting indistinctly )

01:26.550 --> 01:27.580
Texas Rangers!
Drop it!

01:28.550 --> 01:29.550
You heard the man.

02:01.050 --> 02:04.520
(<i> light rock</i>
<i> action theme playing</i> )

02:47.830 --> 02:50.160
Did you get anything
out of these guys

02:50.170 --> 02:51.730
about their supplier?

02:51.730 --> 02:54.730
No, it seems whoever it is,
they're all scared of him.

02:54.740 --> 02:56.370
Whoever it is,

02:56.370 --> 02:58.270
is controlling about half
the drugs in this city.

02:58.270 --> 03:01.040
Walker, we have got
to find him.

03:01.040 --> 03:02.940
Please keep hammering
on all your sources.

03:02.950 --> 03:04.750
We will.

03:04.750 --> 03:07.410
I've got to get
to my arraignment.

03:07.420 --> 03:08.550
We still on for tonight?

03:08.550 --> 03:09.550
You bet.

03:09.550 --> 03:10.780
Wouldn't miss it
for the world.

03:10.790 --> 03:11.790
Great.

03:11.790 --> 03:13.820
Deeley Hall,
room 313.

03:17.060 --> 03:19.290
All right,
let's get to work.

03:19.300 --> 03:22.760
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

03:49.360 --> 03:51.360
( rattling noise )

04:00.740 --> 04:02.600
Hello?

04:02.600 --> 04:04.200
Somebody there?

04:39.040 --> 04:41.270
( clanging noise )

04:49.150 --> 04:51.420
( door slams )

04:53.420 --> 04:55.260
ALEX:
<i> All right, class,</i>

04:55.260 --> 04:56.920
This brings us to the end
of our session

04:56.930 --> 04:58.130
on arrest and indictment.

04:58.130 --> 04:59.490
Any questions?

04:59.500 --> 05:01.030
Alex.

05:01.030 --> 05:03.300
If there's no probable cause
for the arrest,

05:03.300 --> 05:04.700
does that void the indictment?

05:07.970 --> 05:12.210
ALEX:
The only example I can think of
is the case of <i> Jones v. Reilly.</i>

05:12.210 --> 05:14.570
It's 1952-- No, 1953.

05:14.580 --> 05:19.450
This case illustrates
that an officer's biggest--

05:19.450 --> 05:20.450
Stay where you are!

05:20.450 --> 05:22.320
( all screaming )

05:25.050 --> 05:26.050
Drop the knife.

05:26.060 --> 05:27.150
Forget it.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.260
Take one more step,
she's a goner, man.

05:29.260 --> 05:30.720
Drop the gun.

05:31.860 --> 05:33.090
I'll kill her, Ranger.

05:34.260 --> 05:35.660
All right, okay.

05:42.200 --> 05:43.200
Now what?

05:48.710 --> 05:51.140
( students screaming )

06:01.160 --> 06:03.190
You're under arrest.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.900
All right, guys,
you can come out now.

06:14.340 --> 06:17.500
( students groan )

06:17.510 --> 06:19.640
I'd like you to meet
Ranger Walker

06:19.640 --> 06:21.040
and Ranger Trivette.

06:21.040 --> 06:23.610
Wait a minute.
You mean that was all an act?

06:23.610 --> 06:25.910
We wanted to give you a taste
of the real thing.

06:25.910 --> 06:28.210
There was never
any danger.

06:29.120 --> 06:30.580
My gun was...

06:30.590 --> 06:31.580
( clicks )

06:31.590 --> 06:32.590
...unloaded.

06:32.590 --> 06:33.590
MAN:
That's good.

06:33.590 --> 06:36.120
Knife's rubber.

06:36.120 --> 06:38.560
I'm sorry if this exercise
was a little over the top,

06:38.560 --> 06:40.990
but I asked the Rangers to help
me out for a very good reason.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.630
You wanted us to know that
you're a tough grader.

06:43.630 --> 06:44.760
( students laugh )

06:44.770 --> 06:45.900
Well, that too.

06:45.900 --> 06:48.270
No, actually, I wanted you
to get a sense

06:48.270 --> 06:50.500
of how fast an arrest
like this goes down.

06:50.510 --> 06:52.370
And sometimes,
like in this situation,

06:52.370 --> 06:54.040
it's hard for officers
to keep track

06:54.040 --> 06:55.780
of everything
they're required to do.

06:55.780 --> 06:58.310
So can anybody give me
some specifics

06:58.310 --> 07:00.010
about what they observed
in this arrest?

07:00.020 --> 07:01.820
It'll never hold up
in court.

07:01.820 --> 07:03.550
That's right, Susan.
Can you tell us why?

07:03.550 --> 07:05.150
He didn't read him
his rights.

07:05.150 --> 07:08.190
That could be one of the issues.

07:08.190 --> 07:09.720
It looked so real,
I didn't even notice.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.790
My heart was pumping
so fast.

07:11.790 --> 07:14.760
Well, when an officer's put
into such a situation,

07:14.760 --> 07:16.960
their heart's beating
just as fast as yours is,

07:16.970 --> 07:18.460
but...

07:18.470 --> 07:20.900
they have to observe everything
that's going on around them.

07:20.900 --> 07:22.700
We have to do
everything by the book,

07:22.700 --> 07:24.170
otherwise Alex
and her colleagues,

07:24.170 --> 07:26.070
they won't be able
to do their job properly.

07:26.070 --> 07:29.640
Okay, for next week,
I want a three-page paper

07:29.650 --> 07:33.380
detailing the specifics
of why this was a bad bust.

07:33.380 --> 07:37.620
See you next Thursday.

07:37.620 --> 07:38.650
That was a great class.

07:38.650 --> 07:39.820
Thank you.

07:41.160 --> 07:42.160
Alex.

07:43.260 --> 07:45.160
Peter, hi.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.690
I saw the class
breaking up,

07:47.700 --> 07:49.400
so I thought
I'd drop by.

07:49.400 --> 07:50.400
Great.

07:50.400 --> 07:51.970
Oh, Walker, Trivette,

07:51.970 --> 07:53.930
I'd like you to meet
professor Peter Needham.

07:53.940 --> 07:55.570
How do you do?
Nice meeting you, fellas.

07:56.500 --> 07:57.840
Hi.

07:57.840 --> 07:59.870
Peter is the dean of students
here at the university.

07:59.880 --> 08:00.910
Acting dean.

08:00.910 --> 08:02.340
I've only been here
a short while.

08:02.340 --> 08:04.440
They're just sort of
trying me out, actually.

08:04.450 --> 08:05.850
Another thing
we have in common.

08:05.850 --> 08:07.250
That's right.

08:07.250 --> 08:08.650
We grew up 10 minutes
from each other

08:08.650 --> 08:10.250
and never met.
Can you believe that?

08:10.250 --> 08:13.050
ALEX:
We actually know a lot
of the same people.

08:13.050 --> 08:14.790
Well, that's...great.

08:14.790 --> 08:16.560
Excuse me just one sec.

08:16.560 --> 08:18.990
Uh, Alex,
about our coffee date,

08:18.990 --> 08:20.760
I'm gonna have to give you
a rain check on that.

08:20.760 --> 08:22.230
Something's come up,
and, uh...

08:22.230 --> 08:25.230
ALEX:
Oh, no problem.
We'll just reschedule.

08:25.230 --> 08:27.530
Okay.
Tomorrow night good?

08:27.540 --> 08:28.600
Great. You're on.

08:28.600 --> 08:31.070
Great. You look good,
by the way.

08:31.070 --> 08:32.740
Oh, nice meeting you,
fellas.

08:36.240 --> 08:37.240
So...

08:37.250 --> 08:39.250
He called us "fellas."

08:43.080 --> 08:45.080
Professor, huh?

08:45.090 --> 08:46.720
So, what does he teach?

08:46.720 --> 08:50.390
Sociology,
and he has two PhDs.

08:50.390 --> 08:51.990
Very impressive.

08:51.990 --> 08:54.430
We're just friends,
Walker.

08:54.430 --> 08:56.000
You and me,
or him and you?

08:56.000 --> 08:58.430
You guys fight like a bunch
of old married folks.

08:58.430 --> 08:59.770
You know that?

08:59.770 --> 09:01.540
We're not fighting.
We're just discussing.

09:01.540 --> 09:03.970
Yeah, we're just discussing.

09:03.970 --> 09:06.770
By the way, I need to ask you
a very important question.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.980
Does the professor
wear those patches

09:08.980 --> 09:10.540
on all of his jackets?

09:10.550 --> 09:13.080
All right,
now we're fighting.

09:13.080 --> 09:14.080
See what I mean?

09:14.080 --> 09:15.080
Shut up, Jimmy.

09:15.080 --> 09:16.780
Me?

09:16.790 --> 09:19.250
Don't you walk away
from me.

09:19.250 --> 09:21.120
GIRL 1:
See you Thursday.

09:21.120 --> 09:24.120
GUY:
Okay, see you guys.

09:24.130 --> 09:25.990
GIRL 2:
Bye. See you guys later.

09:25.990 --> 09:27.560
Bye-bye.

09:39.170 --> 09:41.540
Damn. I'm on
the wrong floor again.

09:51.890 --> 09:53.220
( door opens )

09:53.220 --> 09:54.620
( footsteps running )

09:54.620 --> 09:57.390
( screaming )

09:57.390 --> 09:58.660
It's coming
from the stairwell.

10:11.640 --> 10:14.040
I'll get an ambulance.

10:26.360 --> 10:28.890
( police radio chatter )

10:30.430 --> 10:31.830
( Trivette speaks
indistinctly )

10:31.830 --> 10:32.990
OFFICER:
Nothing else?

10:35.330 --> 10:37.530
Is that what
the girl said?

10:38.630 --> 10:40.070
Alex.

10:41.100 --> 10:42.640
Peter.

10:42.640 --> 10:44.540
What happened?
I saw the ambulance drive in.

10:44.540 --> 10:46.340
One of my students got mugged.

10:46.340 --> 10:48.110
They're taking her
to the hospital right now.

10:48.110 --> 10:49.140
God, no.

10:49.140 --> 10:50.440
I'm gonna go over there.

10:50.450 --> 10:51.950
No, no, no.
I'm gonna drive you, okay?

10:51.950 --> 10:53.380
I thought you had
something that--

10:53.380 --> 10:55.780
This is more important.
Forget it. Come on.

10:57.150 --> 10:58.990
Yeah, the assault happened
about 9:32.

10:58.990 --> 11:01.890
I went looking for him,
but I couldn't find him.

11:06.760 --> 11:10.560
(<i> solemn theme playing</i> )

11:18.070 --> 11:19.370
Any word?

11:19.370 --> 11:20.870
They're still working on her.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.920
How is she, doctor?

11:28.920 --> 11:30.380
Lucky.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.650
A lot of people wouldn't
survive a beating like that.

11:32.650 --> 11:34.220
We'd like to talk to her.

11:35.690 --> 11:38.060
Just a couple of minutes.
She needs her rest.

11:45.600 --> 11:47.800
Susan, I'm Ranger Walker.

11:47.800 --> 11:49.670
Could you tell us
what happened?

11:52.640 --> 11:53.840
It's all right, Susan.

11:53.840 --> 11:56.110
Alex?

11:57.810 --> 12:00.850
Can you remember anything at all
about the man who attacked you?

12:00.850 --> 12:02.520
What he looked like?

12:05.090 --> 12:07.420
Have you seen him
on campus before?

12:08.560 --> 12:09.990
No.

12:09.990 --> 12:13.060
He was covered up
like you were in the class.

12:13.060 --> 12:15.860
You mean he wore a ski mask
like this?

12:15.860 --> 12:17.730
Did you notice anything else?

12:17.730 --> 12:21.500
The color of his clothes,
the sound of his voice?

12:21.500 --> 12:24.100
Nothing.
I-- I don't know.

12:24.110 --> 12:26.870
It all happened so fast.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.780
I turned and...

12:29.780 --> 12:31.680
he was on me...

12:31.680 --> 12:36.220
and I was fighting
and...

12:36.220 --> 12:37.620
I don't know.

12:37.620 --> 12:40.650
I'm sorry.
You'll have to leave now.

12:40.660 --> 12:42.050
Okay.

12:43.690 --> 12:46.030
I'll be back.

12:51.030 --> 12:52.900
Let's go see if Forensics
has anything.

12:52.900 --> 12:54.670
Okay.

12:54.670 --> 12:56.470
INSTRUCTOR:
Good. Now, from here,

12:56.470 --> 12:58.440
you're gonna show me the jab.
The jab to the face.

12:58.440 --> 12:59.840
With a <i> ki-hai</i> loud
and ready, one.

12:59.840 --> 13:00.840
STUDENTS:
<i> Ki-hai!</i>

13:00.840 --> 13:01.840
Good. Two.

13:01.840 --> 13:02.840
<i> Ki-hai!</i>

13:02.840 --> 13:03.940
Three.
<i> Ki-hai!</i>

13:03.940 --> 13:05.210
Four.<i> </i>
<i> Ki-hai!</i>

13:05.210 --> 13:06.710
Very good.
This time reverse punch.

13:06.710 --> 13:08.210
Show me your speed.
Show me your power.

13:08.220 --> 13:09.620
Ready, one.
<i> Ki-hai!</i>

13:09.620 --> 13:10.620
Good. Two.

13:10.620 --> 13:11.920
<i> Ki-hai!</i>

13:11.920 --> 13:13.890
Good, one more time.
Fast, are you ready? Three.

13:13.890 --> 13:15.120
<i> Ki-hai!</i>

13:15.120 --> 13:16.890
Good. Go, this time let's add
a reverse punch.

13:16.890 --> 13:18.890
<i> Ki-hai</i> on my count.
Ready. Block.

13:18.890 --> 13:20.160
<i> Ki-hai!</i>

13:20.160 --> 13:21.790
Punch <i> ki-hai!</i>
<i> Ki-hai!</i>

13:21.800 --> 13:24.560
Good. Turn back full.
Remember,<i> ki-hai</i> on my count.

13:24.570 --> 13:26.770
Ready. Block.
Punch,<i> ki-hai!</i>

13:26.770 --> 13:27.800
<i> Ki-hai!</i>

13:27.800 --> 13:29.340
Good. Let me see
those reverse punches.

13:29.340 --> 13:31.440
Ready, block.
Punch,<i> ki-hai!</i>

13:31.440 --> 13:32.600
<i> Ki-hai!</i>

13:32.610 --> 13:34.370
Good. Keep those punches out.
Let me see them.

13:34.380 --> 13:35.510
Let me see them.
Good. Ready.

13:35.510 --> 13:36.840
<i> Ki-hai!</i>

13:36.850 --> 13:38.180
Three.
<i> Ki-hai.</i>

13:38.180 --> 13:39.550
Hi, Laura.

13:39.550 --> 13:41.650
Where's Tony? The kid you were
gonna make room for?

13:41.650 --> 13:42.650
Oh, he didn't show up.

13:42.650 --> 13:44.180
What?

13:44.190 --> 13:46.120
Look, it's probably
for the best, because, uh,

13:46.120 --> 13:47.620
we're really
overcrowded anyway.

13:47.620 --> 13:48.820
I know where he is.

13:48.820 --> 13:50.320
He'll be here
by the end of class.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.130
<i> Ki-hai.</i>
Good, hold!

13:52.130 --> 13:53.690
<i> Ki-hai.</i>
Good.

13:55.160 --> 13:57.030
One second.

14:02.940 --> 14:04.240
All right,
start her up.

14:04.240 --> 14:05.440
( engine roars )

14:05.440 --> 14:07.510
Yeah!

14:09.980 --> 14:11.340
All right!

14:11.350 --> 14:13.450
Way to go, Tony, my man.

14:14.650 --> 14:16.120
I gotta book.
There's the counselor.

14:16.120 --> 14:17.220
Tony I wanna
talk to you now.

14:17.220 --> 14:18.450
Well, I don't wanna
talk to you,

14:18.450 --> 14:19.850
so why don't you
just leave me alone.

14:19.860 --> 14:21.860
Inside. Let's go.

14:21.860 --> 14:23.390
Now.

14:26.930 --> 14:28.590
All right.

14:31.430 --> 14:34.170
You don't take this class
and show up every day,

14:34.170 --> 14:35.300
you're gonna get expelled.

14:35.300 --> 14:36.300
So?

14:36.300 --> 14:37.300
So? So stop being
a jerk

14:37.310 --> 14:38.500
and get a life.

14:38.510 --> 14:40.140
Why don't you just
give up on me, all right?

14:40.140 --> 14:41.140
Everyone else has.

14:41.140 --> 14:42.640
Sorry, it's not in my nature.

14:42.640 --> 14:45.510
It's a stupid idea, you know,
this karate crap.

14:45.510 --> 14:47.810
Supposed to build
my character.

14:47.820 --> 14:50.380
You know, my mom's boyfriend
was some kind of champ,

14:50.380 --> 14:51.920
and he's a certified jerk.

14:51.920 --> 14:53.220
Walker isn't a jerk.

14:53.220 --> 14:54.820
He's a nice guy
and you're gonna like him.

14:54.820 --> 14:57.260
Yeah, that's what my mom always
says about her boyfriends.

14:57.260 --> 14:59.090
Walker isn't my boyfriend.

14:59.090 --> 15:00.290
Whoo. Gotcha.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.070
I'm telling you,
this ain't going to work.

15:10.070 --> 15:12.210
Just get in there,
will ya?

15:12.210 --> 15:15.370
( instructor commanding
in Japanese )

15:23.020 --> 15:26.290
( students applauding )

15:26.290 --> 15:28.020
Line up.

15:36.300 --> 15:38.730
( commands in Japanese )

15:38.730 --> 15:40.430
Who are we?

15:40.440 --> 15:41.940
STUDENTS:
A team, sir.

15:41.940 --> 15:43.540
What does "T" stand for?

15:43.540 --> 15:44.840
STUDENTS:
Truth, sir.

15:44.840 --> 15:45.840
"E"?

15:45.840 --> 15:46.840
STUDENTS:
Esteem, sir.

15:46.840 --> 15:47.840
WALKER:
"A"?

15:47.840 --> 15:49.110
STUDENTS:
Attitude, sir.

15:49.110 --> 15:50.110
"M"?

15:50.110 --> 15:51.310
STUDENTS:
Motivation, sir.

15:51.310 --> 15:52.310
Who are we?

15:52.310 --> 15:53.810
STUDENTS:
A team, sir.

15:53.820 --> 15:56.780
( speaking in Japanese )

16:00.460 --> 16:01.550
Class dismissed.

16:01.560 --> 16:03.220
STUDENTS:
Thank you, sir.

16:05.930 --> 16:08.230
( students chattering
indistinctly )

16:11.970 --> 16:13.630
Hey, Tony.

16:13.630 --> 16:14.630
How you doing?

16:14.640 --> 16:16.440
What are you doing
in this class?

16:16.440 --> 16:18.040
You could take anybody
at this school.

16:18.040 --> 16:19.610
It's not about being tough.

16:19.610 --> 16:21.810
It's about feeling good
about yourself.

16:22.710 --> 16:24.180
WALKER:
Hey, Manuel.

16:24.180 --> 16:26.180
I heard you won the tournament
in Houston last week.

16:26.180 --> 16:27.310
Yes, sir, I did.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.980
Well, congratulations.
Sorry I missed it.

16:28.980 --> 16:30.820
Thank you, sir.

16:30.820 --> 16:32.720
Was that Ranger Walker?

16:32.720 --> 16:33.720
Yeah.

16:33.720 --> 16:35.460
So you gonna be in the class?

16:35.460 --> 16:38.060
I guess I have to.

16:38.060 --> 16:41.030
Well, you better not
be late again.

16:47.270 --> 16:48.570
Tony Kingston?

16:50.200 --> 16:51.870
Yes, sir.

16:51.870 --> 16:53.670
Well, that's
a good start, Tony.

16:53.670 --> 16:57.380
Mr. White, could you come
over here a second?

16:57.380 --> 16:59.340
Mr. White,
this is Tony Kingston,

16:59.350 --> 17:00.380
our new student.

17:00.380 --> 17:01.750
Mr. White teaches
the classes.

17:01.750 --> 17:03.180
How you doing, Tony?
Hi.

17:03.180 --> 17:05.420
Make sure you show up tomorrow
after school at 3:00, okay?

17:05.420 --> 17:06.890
Okay.
All right.

17:06.890 --> 17:08.490
I got something for you.

17:10.390 --> 17:13.490
Take this home and try it on.
It should fit you.

17:15.030 --> 17:16.099
Thank you, sir.

17:16.099 --> 17:18.700
You're welcome.
And, uh...

17:20.240 --> 17:21.329
don't be late again.

17:34.820 --> 17:41.690
(<i> subdued theme playing</i> )

18:00.140 --> 18:02.170
It's going down.

18:02.180 --> 18:04.040
Those two Rangers will
never know what hit them.

18:04.050 --> 18:06.550
Let me tell you something.

18:06.550 --> 18:09.050
You're dealing with
Cordell Walker.

18:09.050 --> 18:10.750
Don't underestimate him.

18:10.750 --> 18:12.650
He's the best they've got.

18:12.650 --> 18:14.320
If you're gonna make
a move on him,

18:14.320 --> 18:16.590
get it right the first time.
Otherwise,

18:16.590 --> 18:18.420
he's gonna sink
his teeth into you

18:18.430 --> 18:19.630
and he's never gonna let go.

18:19.630 --> 18:22.260
Hey, I like a challenge...

18:22.260 --> 18:23.730
and I never lose.

18:23.730 --> 18:25.800
Neither does Walker.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.500
Now, what about Cahill?

18:27.500 --> 18:29.030
My attorneys tell me

18:29.040 --> 18:31.340
she's real close to entering
an indictment on me.

18:31.340 --> 18:33.340
Yeah, close but no cigar.

18:33.340 --> 18:36.280
And you're gonna make sure
it stays that way.

18:36.280 --> 18:38.080
Long as I keep getting my end.

18:41.950 --> 18:43.220
( clasps click open )

18:46.860 --> 18:47.950
( sighs )

18:49.590 --> 18:53.260
The Rangers will be dead
within 24 hours.

18:57.630 --> 18:58.630
Hey.

18:58.630 --> 19:00.200
What?

19:00.200 --> 19:01.470
Look, I gotta--
I gotta say this.

19:01.470 --> 19:02.740
I've been holding
back too long.

19:02.740 --> 19:04.000
You gotta clean
this truck, man.

19:04.010 --> 19:05.540
It's a mess.

19:05.540 --> 19:06.970
Don't dis my truck.

19:08.980 --> 19:10.180
I'm sorry.

19:10.180 --> 19:11.540
Apology accepted.

19:11.550 --> 19:12.810
That's not what
I'm sorry about.

19:12.810 --> 19:14.180
Then what are you
sorry about?

19:14.180 --> 19:16.420
I'm sorry about the thing
with Alex and the professor.

19:16.420 --> 19:17.920
I mean, you know,
that's a tough break.

19:17.920 --> 19:20.020
Personally, if you ask me,
you waited around too long.

19:20.020 --> 19:22.190
If you want something,
you gotta go after it.

19:22.190 --> 19:23.720
You can't wait around
for these women.

19:23.730 --> 19:25.020
I don't intend to.

19:25.030 --> 19:26.790
See, now, great!
See, now, that's the spirit.

19:26.790 --> 19:28.760
What are you gonna do?
Oh, I'll tell you what you do,

19:28.760 --> 19:30.560
she loves lilacs.
I know this, Walker,

19:30.570 --> 19:31.930
because I was in her office
one time

19:31.930 --> 19:33.400
and it was her birthday
or something.

19:33.400 --> 19:35.370
Her folks sent her a bunch
of them. She <i> loves</i> them.

19:35.370 --> 19:37.570
What I'm gonna do, Trivette,
is I'm gonna try

19:37.570 --> 19:40.210
to find the guy who attacked
the girl on the campus.

19:40.210 --> 19:42.270
Then if I've got any time,
I'd like to try to catch

19:42.280 --> 19:43.980
the guy supplying drugs
in the city.

19:43.980 --> 19:45.610
How does that sound to you?

19:45.610 --> 19:48.010
It sounds great, but
it's not nearly as much fun--

19:48.020 --> 19:50.250
What are you doing?
Why are you driving so fast?

19:50.250 --> 19:51.580
The accelerator's stuck.

19:51.590 --> 19:52.750
Well, get your foot off it.

19:52.750 --> 19:54.690
I am. I'm pumping.

19:54.690 --> 19:57.120
Hit the brake, Walker.

19:57.130 --> 19:58.260
What brakes?

19:58.260 --> 19:59.830
Cut the ignition.
I did.

19:59.830 --> 20:00.830
Watch out!

20:03.400 --> 20:05.060
Watch the tracks!

20:05.070 --> 20:06.070
Walker!

20:11.740 --> 20:13.740
Somebody tampered
with the truck, man.

20:13.740 --> 20:16.680
Hold on.
We're in for a hard ride.

20:17.380 --> 20:18.640
( horn honking )

20:20.110 --> 20:21.110
Walker!

20:26.450 --> 20:27.450
Watch out, the tree!

20:32.090 --> 20:33.860
Walker!

20:36.160 --> 20:37.360
TRIVETTE:
Watch out!

20:40.640 --> 20:42.130
Look out!

20:42.140 --> 20:44.040
Watch the shack!
Watch out for the shack!

20:44.040 --> 20:45.040
I'm watching it.

20:59.820 --> 21:00.850
You know what.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.020
What?

21:02.020 --> 21:03.760
I think I'm gonna wash
this truck.

21:03.760 --> 21:05.520
Oh.

21:09.400 --> 21:11.760
C.D., you have any milk
for my coffee?

21:11.770 --> 21:13.470
C.D.:
You bet, Cordell.

21:13.470 --> 21:17.470
Oh, I heard you and Jimmy
had a pretty rough ride.

21:17.470 --> 21:18.770
You okay?

21:18.770 --> 21:20.410
Yeah, I'm fine.

21:20.410 --> 21:22.070
My truck took a beating, though.

21:22.080 --> 21:23.980
You know, this is the first time
I've ever heard of

21:23.980 --> 21:26.210
an individual trying
to take out two Rangers.

21:26.210 --> 21:28.710
Yeah, whoever
this drug kingpin is,

21:28.720 --> 21:30.020
he's taking it personal.

21:30.020 --> 21:31.480
You'd better be careful.

21:31.490 --> 21:34.690
A guy with no conscience,
he's just like a rattlesnake.

21:34.690 --> 21:38.420
He'll shoot you
just to watch you fall.

21:38.430 --> 21:40.060
How's everything
on the personal front?

21:40.060 --> 21:41.860
Fine. Why?

21:41.860 --> 21:45.730
Well, Jimmy was just
telling me that, uh...

21:45.730 --> 21:50.400
well, just that there might be
something between you and Alex,

21:50.410 --> 21:51.870
that's all.

21:51.870 --> 21:54.010
Professor Peter Patches,

21:54.010 --> 21:57.040
or whatever the hell
the guy's name is.

21:57.050 --> 21:59.050
It looks like he's moved in
on your territory.

21:59.050 --> 22:01.210
C.D., what are you
talking about?

22:01.220 --> 22:03.950
Jimmy tells me that this guy
may have a shot with Alex.

22:03.950 --> 22:06.080
Alex can date
anyone she wants to.

22:06.090 --> 22:07.450
It doesn't matter to me.

22:07.460 --> 22:08.450
Maybe.

22:08.460 --> 22:10.490
Maybe thunder curdles milk.

22:10.490 --> 22:12.720
Maybe they'll get married.

22:12.730 --> 22:14.630
Maybe they'll be
hip-deep in children.

22:14.630 --> 22:16.960
And maybe, just maybe,

22:16.960 --> 22:19.030
you and Uncle Ray are gonna
end up on a ranch

22:19.030 --> 22:20.700
with a bunch of damn chickens.

22:20.700 --> 22:23.070
Cluck, cluck, cluck
cluck, cluck.

22:28.580 --> 22:29.580
Hi.

22:32.110 --> 22:33.110
What?

22:33.110 --> 22:35.210
Nothing. Forget it.

22:35.220 --> 22:37.080
I've been trying to run down
all the angles

22:37.090 --> 22:38.420
on the campus attack.

22:38.420 --> 22:40.220
Forensics didn't find anything

22:40.220 --> 22:41.590
in the stairwell
last night, so...

22:41.590 --> 22:42.590
we got nothing.

22:42.590 --> 22:44.590
Did you try
campus security?

22:44.590 --> 22:46.660
Yeah. I put in
a call to them.

22:46.660 --> 22:48.630
C.D., the usual, huh?

22:50.130 --> 22:51.600
I just spoke to Susan.

22:51.600 --> 22:53.970
She's going home
from the hospital tomorrow.

22:53.970 --> 22:55.830
That's good.

22:56.740 --> 22:58.500
That's good.

23:00.610 --> 23:02.010
That's good.

23:02.010 --> 23:03.010
Jimmy.

23:03.010 --> 23:04.280
What?

23:04.280 --> 23:06.180
Don't stand there
like a tree full of owls.

23:06.180 --> 23:08.250
Those people may want
to be alone.

23:16.020 --> 23:17.460
You wanna talk about it?
What?

23:17.460 --> 23:18.990
It.
It?

23:18.990 --> 23:20.390
All right, him.
Who?

23:20.400 --> 23:21.830
You know.
No.

23:21.830 --> 23:23.560
Walker.
What?

23:23.560 --> 23:25.300
Okay. Forget it.

23:25.300 --> 23:27.230
Okay.

23:29.140 --> 23:31.740
C.D.:
Just look at him.

23:31.740 --> 23:34.340
He's just...pained.

23:34.340 --> 23:36.110
Look at his eyes.

23:36.110 --> 23:37.840
He's built a shell
up around himself, Jimmy.

23:37.850 --> 23:38.980
TRIVETTE:
I know.

23:38.980 --> 23:41.710
We're gonna
have to help him.

23:41.720 --> 23:43.720
Yup, he's just like

23:43.720 --> 23:45.580
some kind of old
mossback turtle or something.

23:45.590 --> 23:47.750
TRIVETTE:
Yeah.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.990
Don't say
anything to him now.

23:49.990 --> 23:51.320
Just don't mention it.

23:51.330 --> 23:53.860
We'll talk about it
tomorrow, okay?

23:53.860 --> 23:54.960
BOTH:
What'd she say?

24:09.180 --> 24:11.080
I'll come get you
after school.

24:11.080 --> 24:14.480
Right. While I'm in class,
why don't you go talk to Benny.

24:14.480 --> 24:16.120
Why?

24:16.120 --> 24:19.290
Just see if he has any leads on
the guys that tried to kill us.

24:19.290 --> 24:21.550
That slime's been holding out
on us for weeks,

24:21.560 --> 24:23.120
It's just going to be
a waste of time.

24:23.120 --> 24:25.290
Then just use your charm.

24:25.290 --> 24:27.790
You want me to push him.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.400
Hard.

24:34.970 --> 24:37.100
Yeah, yeah, 16 to 1.

24:37.100 --> 24:38.100
WOMAN:
I'm sorry, sir.

24:38.110 --> 24:39.100
No, no, no.

24:39.110 --> 24:40.310
He's busy.

24:40.310 --> 24:42.240
BENNY:
No more credit.
You heard me, Leo.

24:43.340 --> 24:45.080
What is this?

24:45.080 --> 24:47.350
Time to do
your civic duty, Benny.

24:47.350 --> 24:48.810
Tell her to take her
lunch break.

24:48.820 --> 24:50.080
Tell her.

24:51.990 --> 24:53.950
Go on. It's okay, Ida.
Just go on.

25:00.330 --> 25:02.760
Look, I already
gave you guys too much.

25:02.760 --> 25:04.500
I almost got
my head blown off.

25:04.500 --> 25:06.060
I'm done.
You understand me?

25:06.070 --> 25:07.200
Sure, I understand.

25:07.200 --> 25:08.870
Benny, that's a hell of a horse

25:08.870 --> 25:11.200
you got running
in the fifth, here.

25:11.210 --> 25:13.610
Hey, you want to bust me?
Go ahead.

25:13.610 --> 25:14.940
Go ahead, bust me.

25:14.940 --> 25:16.810
But I'm not giving up
on my friends anymore.

25:17.950 --> 25:19.480
You ain't got
any friends, Benny.

25:19.480 --> 25:21.350
Heard you guys
had a little accident.

25:21.350 --> 25:22.850
Glad to see you're okay.

25:22.850 --> 25:25.080
I'm sure you are.
Who set us up?

25:25.090 --> 25:27.650
Hey, how would I know?

25:27.660 --> 25:29.820
Hey, hey.
Now, guy, don't do that.

25:29.820 --> 25:31.360
Need a name.

25:31.360 --> 25:33.390
Benny.
Hey, I told you,
I don't--

25:33.390 --> 25:35.460
Don't do-- Hey!
Hey, don't--
I need a name.

25:35.460 --> 25:36.900
No. Wait--

25:38.000 --> 25:39.870
Benny, we need a name.
You got a name yet?

25:43.740 --> 25:46.040
I could make
a couple of calls.

25:52.080 --> 25:54.010
You know
where you can find me.

25:54.010 --> 25:56.150
Yeah.

you just do what I say.

26:32.290 --> 26:33.650
Don't think, just do.
You got that?

26:33.650 --> 26:36.250
Okay, okay.

26:36.260 --> 26:38.520
But them Rangers,
they're coming down hard.

26:38.530 --> 26:41.230
Guy just burned up 20K
in good markers.

26:41.230 --> 26:43.930
I don't care
about your pocket change, Benny.

26:43.930 --> 26:46.260
You turn me, and you're dead.
Do you understand?

26:46.270 --> 26:47.530
I understand.

26:47.530 --> 26:49.100
Good.

26:49.100 --> 26:50.740
Now, I'll take care
of the Rangers.

26:50.740 --> 26:52.540
You keep your mouth shut.

26:55.710 --> 26:58.140

27:04.690 --> 27:06.150

Mom.

27:12.990 --> 27:14.830
Oh, damn it.

27:14.830 --> 27:16.700
No, you know,
I-I fell. Really.

27:16.700 --> 27:18.160
I-I tripped.
That's all.

27:18.170 --> 27:20.570
Mom, you did not fall,
all right?
Yes, I did--

27:20.570 --> 27:21.830
That st--

27:23.100 --> 27:26.740
You took your sweet time
getting home.

27:26.740 --> 27:28.540
I had to do something
at school.

27:28.540 --> 27:30.010
Shut up.

27:30.010 --> 27:31.940
Get your rear back here
on time from now on.

27:31.950 --> 27:33.180
I got a delivery
for you to make.

27:33.180 --> 27:35.250
I can't.
I have to go to work.

27:35.250 --> 27:36.520
Tell them you're sick.

27:36.520 --> 27:40.450
This has to be
across town before 5.

27:43.420 --> 27:44.920
It's an important order.
You blow it,

27:44.930 --> 27:46.630
and it could cost me.

27:50.760 --> 27:52.630
All right.

27:56.370 --> 27:59.900
(<i> melancholy theme playing</i> )

28:11.890 --> 28:14.120
Now, my name's inside.

28:14.120 --> 28:15.720
Don't try to steal--
Yeah, I see it.

28:15.720 --> 28:17.060
Hey, Walker.
You'll get it back.

28:17.060 --> 28:18.460
I'll see you later.

28:18.460 --> 28:19.830
What's up?

28:19.830 --> 28:21.030
TRIVETTE:
Check this out.

28:21.030 --> 28:22.590
Been doing a little research,

28:22.600 --> 28:24.560
trying to put together
a better profile

28:24.570 --> 28:26.160
on our campus mugger.

28:26.170 --> 28:29.570
These are police reports
filed by the campus cops.

28:29.570 --> 28:31.040
This one's last July.

28:31.040 --> 28:33.270
This one's beginning
of October.

28:33.270 --> 28:35.170
According to these,
two girls were raped

28:35.180 --> 28:36.940
in that same parking garage.

28:36.940 --> 28:39.980
And it was the same exact
set of circumstances too.

28:39.980 --> 28:41.610
Girl's alone,
she's coming from class.

28:41.620 --> 28:44.420
It's same time of night,
empty stairwell.

28:44.420 --> 28:46.420
They ever catch the guy?
Mm-mm.

28:46.420 --> 28:48.650
Neither victim was able to give
a good enough description,

28:48.660 --> 28:52.190
because both times
the attacker wore a ski mask.

28:52.190 --> 28:53.930
Now, this one left town
right after,

28:53.930 --> 28:55.530
dropped out of sight.

28:55.530 --> 28:58.660
This one was beaten,
pushed down the stairway,

28:58.670 --> 29:00.030
knocked out cold.

29:00.030 --> 29:01.200
Just like Susan.

29:01.200 --> 29:02.630
Mm-hm.

29:02.640 --> 29:04.000
I wonder
if he tried to rape her.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.170
Let's go find out.

29:10.840 --> 29:12.010
I was attacked

29:12.010 --> 29:13.580
and he pushed me
down the stairs.

29:13.580 --> 29:15.080
I don't know
anything else.

29:15.080 --> 29:18.020
Then, you don't know
if he tried to rape you or not?

29:19.020 --> 29:21.350
No.

29:21.360 --> 29:25.120
I don't know.
It all happened so fast.

29:25.130 --> 29:27.390
He was on me, and...

29:27.390 --> 29:31.200
I was fighting,
and I turned and...

29:31.200 --> 29:33.830
tried to run
up the stairs.

29:33.830 --> 29:35.770
And then he grabbed me
from behind,

29:35.770 --> 29:36.840
and that's when I screamed.

29:36.840 --> 29:39.370
Then he just
started hitting me,

29:39.370 --> 29:40.470
and I fell.

29:40.470 --> 29:42.210
So it was possible?

29:43.180 --> 29:46.140
Yeah.

29:46.150 --> 29:47.850
I guess so.

29:47.850 --> 29:51.750
(<i> low-key theme playing</i> )

30:02.660 --> 30:03.730
Yeah, if you ask me,

30:03.730 --> 30:05.430
you guys are barking
up the wrong tree.

30:06.170 --> 30:07.430
We're not asking you.

30:08.970 --> 30:10.840
Then what do you want?

30:10.840 --> 30:12.340
Your cooperation.

30:12.340 --> 30:15.340
WALKER:
Look, we believe there's
a rapist here on campus.

30:15.340 --> 30:16.670
And we want you
to beef up security

30:16.680 --> 30:17.910
in the underground garages.

30:17.910 --> 30:20.110
No can do.
I just ain't got the manpower.

Ranger Trivette.

30:25.590 --> 30:26.890
Hi, professor.

30:26.890 --> 30:28.490
I saw you fellas come in.

30:28.490 --> 30:29.960
Anything I can
help you with?

30:29.960 --> 30:31.360
Ranger here thinks
we got ourselves

30:31.360 --> 30:33.790
a serial rapist.
He wants us to beef up security.

30:33.790 --> 30:36.160
This have something to do with,
uh, the attack on that girl?

30:36.160 --> 30:37.500
That Susan person?

30:37.500 --> 30:39.330
That, and the two rapes
that have occurred here

30:39.330 --> 30:41.070
on the campus
in the last six months.

30:41.070 --> 30:42.370
Well, Susan was not raped.

30:42.370 --> 30:44.500
No. But we think there
might have been an attempt.

30:44.510 --> 30:47.110
WALKER:
And we'd like for you to take
the security precautions.

30:47.110 --> 30:49.410
Well, uh, then we will.

30:51.610 --> 30:52.710
We'll have to.

Peter, get to you.

things in around me, huh?

on the line for each other.

an ordinary relationship

but she freaked out, all right?

doing more than talking.

Please, let him go.

31:59.110 --> 32:01.410
Are you sure that's
what you want us to do?

Yes. Please let him go.

was raped last summer.

Ever since then,
I've been really spooked.

32:19.900 --> 32:22.800
Last summer?
Jody Edwards?

32:22.800 --> 32:24.000
You know about that?

32:24.000 --> 32:25.370
How well did you know her?

32:26.570 --> 32:28.810
Well, she was a quiet girl.

32:28.810 --> 32:31.880
Kept to herself,
and studied most of the time.

32:31.880 --> 32:33.780
She'd just been going out
with this guy, though,

32:33.780 --> 32:35.680
and they broke up, and--
Can you give us his name?

32:35.680 --> 32:37.750
Mm. She wouldn't tell me.

32:37.750 --> 32:39.520
Rumor has it he was one
of the new professors,

32:39.520 --> 32:42.220
and you know they have
all those rules about that now.

32:42.220 --> 32:44.460
I guess he'd have gotten
fired if anyone found out.

32:50.560 --> 32:52.900
So how can I help you?

32:52.900 --> 32:54.870
I understand
that one of the girls

32:54.870 --> 32:56.300
that was raped here on campus--

32:56.300 --> 32:58.770
A Miss Jody Edwards.

--was dating
one of the new professors here.

Wait a second, now.

code of ethics here.

well, I'm sure it's happened.

it's highly unlikely.

to check it out, just the same.

that you're going to get anyone

33:19.160 --> 33:20.990
to admit to anything.

33:20.990 --> 33:23.400
We've got a very
hairy situation here, guys.

you're gonna get someone to ask.

We'd like to try
your faculty personnel file.

in the spring semester.

are highly confidential.

make copies of them,

33:53.630 --> 33:55.360
and give them
to the gentlemen here. Okay?

33:55.960 --> 33:57.560
Okay.

Is that okay?

send those records
directly to me, okay?

35:10.900 --> 35:12.370
I'll work on it.

35:13.270 --> 35:14.470
You're doing a good job, Tony.

35:14.470 --> 35:15.770
Keep it up, okay?

35:15.780 --> 35:17.440
Thank you, sir.
You're welcome.

35:21.680 --> 35:23.520
Yes!

35:23.520 --> 35:25.180
( students chattering )

35:25.180 --> 35:27.590
Oh, hi.
Hi. How was class?

35:27.590 --> 35:29.820
Oh, great.
Tony's doing a good job.

35:29.820 --> 35:31.320
All his teachers
are talking about

35:31.320 --> 35:32.990
how dramatically
his attitude's changed.

35:32.990 --> 35:34.760
Is that right?
I knew if anyone

35:34.760 --> 35:36.260
could turn him around,
it would be you.

35:36.260 --> 35:38.200
Well, all he had to do
was want to.

35:38.200 --> 35:41.000
So how about I cook dinner
for you Saturday night

35:41.000 --> 35:42.800
just to thank you
for all your help?

35:42.800 --> 35:44.470
Well, I'd really like to, but...

35:44.470 --> 35:46.440
I've got plans Saturday night.

35:46.440 --> 35:47.510
Can I take a rain check?

35:47.510 --> 35:49.270
Sure.

35:56.450 --> 35:57.650
Who's that?

35:57.650 --> 36:00.320
Tony's counselor.

36:00.320 --> 36:02.050
Mm-hm.

36:04.760 --> 36:06.120
( chuckling )

36:06.560 --> 36:07.690
Tony.

36:09.630 --> 36:11.360
You were supposed
to be somewhere

36:11.370 --> 36:12.860
about an hour ago, man.

36:12.870 --> 36:14.570
Now let's go.
WALKER: Hey, Tony.

36:15.500 --> 36:18.200
You okay?
Yeah, he's fine.

36:18.210 --> 36:19.600
You Tony's father?

36:20.710 --> 36:23.180
No. Me and Tony's mom
are engaged.

36:23.180 --> 36:24.540
To be honest,
I'm finding it

36:24.550 --> 36:26.950
rather hard
to be a father figure.

36:26.950 --> 36:29.780
The kid here don't make it
any easier, either.

36:29.780 --> 36:31.450
I give him a job delivering
for my business,

36:31.450 --> 36:33.080
he never shows up on time.

36:33.090 --> 36:34.450
What business are you in?

36:34.450 --> 36:36.960
I specialize
in Oriental tapestries.

36:36.960 --> 36:39.020
Kind of fell into it.
Vietnam.

36:39.030 --> 36:40.590
Got a card on you?

36:40.590 --> 36:43.190
I just happen to be interested
in that kind of thing.

36:43.200 --> 36:44.860
Yeah.
Here you go.

36:46.230 --> 36:47.900
I'll see you in karate class
tomorrow, Tony.

36:47.900 --> 36:49.300
Yes, sir.

36:49.300 --> 36:51.440
Oh, so that's where
you've been after school.

36:51.440 --> 36:53.070
Why didn't you tell
your mom and me?

36:53.070 --> 36:54.470
That'll be real good
for the kid.

36:54.470 --> 36:57.070
Maybe teach him some discipline.
Never enough of that, you know.

37:00.180 --> 37:02.280
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

37:02.280 --> 37:04.280
Say, champ,
let's go.

37:07.390 --> 37:08.820
What's his name?

37:08.820 --> 37:11.260
Curt Nypo.

37:11.260 --> 37:13.190
Run a make on him.
You got it.

37:13.190 --> 37:15.060
Get in there.

37:21.630 --> 37:23.130
So you want to learn
karate, huh?

37:23.140 --> 37:25.140
I'll teach you karate.

37:25.140 --> 37:27.300
See how good it works?

37:27.310 --> 37:28.710
Okay, now listen up.

37:28.710 --> 37:30.410
You keep your butt
out of that class

37:30.410 --> 37:32.340
and away from that Ranger.
You got that?

37:32.350 --> 37:33.440
Huh?

37:35.150 --> 37:37.050
( engine starts )

37:37.050 --> 37:38.720
( tires squealing )

37:39.290 --> 37:41.720
( Tony panting )

37:43.360 --> 37:44.820
( horn honking,
tires squealing )

37:45.930 --> 37:47.290
MAN 1: Look out!
MAN 2: Crazy boy!

37:47.290 --> 37:48.660
( car horn honking )

37:50.730 --> 37:52.200
( car horn honking,

37:52.200 --> 37:53.800
( horns honking )

37:55.370 --> 37:56.970
MAN:
Stupid kid!

37:56.970 --> 37:58.140
Jerk!

37:58.140 --> 38:00.740
( car speeding away )

38:01.740 --> 38:03.740
Aw, man.

38:14.190 --> 38:18.660
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

38:28.900 --> 38:31.240
( crickets chirping )

38:32.410 --> 38:34.070
It was a good class.

38:34.070 --> 38:36.110
Yeah.
Good night.

38:36.110 --> 38:37.840
Hey, maybe we should
walk you all the way.

38:37.840 --> 38:40.040
Oh, no. My car's
right up here under the light.

38:40.050 --> 38:41.310
But thank you.
All right.

38:41.310 --> 38:42.850
Good night.
See ya.

38:46.490 --> 38:49.020
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

38:49.020 --> 38:52.590
( students chattering
in distance )

38:56.500 --> 38:59.230
( can rattling )

38:59.230 --> 39:00.300
Aahh!

39:00.300 --> 39:01.600
( grunting )

39:05.670 --> 39:07.340
( panting )

39:07.340 --> 39:08.710
What happened?
I don't know.

39:10.680 --> 39:12.440
( grunting )

39:15.380 --> 39:18.020
I didn't do nothing.

39:18.020 --> 39:19.780
I swear it.

39:19.790 --> 39:23.390
It--
It was the other guy.

39:24.290 --> 39:25.690
Well--

39:25.690 --> 39:27.160
He was moving up on her,

39:27.160 --> 39:28.530
and I chased him away.

39:28.530 --> 39:32.160
And then this crazy broad
attacked me.

39:32.170 --> 39:33.670
That "crazy broad"

39:33.670 --> 39:35.230
is the assistant
district attorney.

39:35.240 --> 39:37.570
I tell you, man,

39:37.570 --> 39:40.110
give them women power,
and look what happens.

39:40.110 --> 39:43.140
They turn mean and spiteful
on you, that's what.

39:43.140 --> 39:45.110
You don't like women much,
do you, Stan?

39:45.110 --> 39:47.150
I love 'em.

39:47.150 --> 39:48.580
When they know their place.

39:48.580 --> 39:50.780
Well, how did you feel
about Susan Medford?

39:50.780 --> 39:52.580
Never met her.

39:52.590 --> 39:55.450
We found her scarf
in your room

39:55.450 --> 39:56.690
and a ski mask.

39:56.690 --> 39:59.920
So? That supposed
to mean something?

39:59.930 --> 40:02.530
I find all kinds of things
lying around.

40:02.530 --> 40:03.730
Sometimes I keep 'em.

40:03.730 --> 40:05.160
Oh, you're a collector.

40:06.530 --> 40:08.230
No law against it,
is there?

40:10.800 --> 40:13.070
We'll have the warrant
first thing in the morning.

40:13.070 --> 40:15.370
Then you guys can go back in
and clean the place out.

40:15.380 --> 40:16.510
Good.

40:16.510 --> 40:17.780
Well, I guess
we won't be needing

40:17.780 --> 40:20.080
that extra security
on campus now, will we?

40:20.080 --> 40:22.080
Let's make sure
we have the right guy first.

40:22.080 --> 40:25.020
You know, Ranger,
seems pretty clear to me--

40:25.020 --> 40:26.520
Nothing's clear, professor,

40:26.520 --> 40:28.290
until we complete
the investigation.

40:33.030 --> 40:34.230
I'll see you tomorrow.

40:41.300 --> 40:43.330
Oh, man. Why don't you just
go after her

40:43.340 --> 40:45.170
and tell her you think
he's a jerk?

40:45.170 --> 40:47.410
If you have to,
throw in the "L" word, you know.

40:47.410 --> 40:50.540
But, what are you--?
What are you wasting time for?

40:50.540 --> 40:52.580
Trivette, do you mind?

40:52.580 --> 40:54.410
Trivette, I think
it's a good idea.

40:54.410 --> 40:55.710
( telephone rings )

40:57.280 --> 40:59.520
Yeah. Trivette.
WOMAN: <i> It's Benny Travatore.</i>

40:59.520 --> 41:00.590
Benny.

41:02.290 --> 41:04.220
BENNY ( over speaker ):
<i> I got something for you.</i>

41:04.220 --> 41:06.260
There's a deal
going down tonight. Midnight.

41:06.260 --> 41:09.790
The marina on Weaver Lake.
Slip 93.

41:09.800 --> 41:12.600
The guy you're looking for
will be there.

41:16.800 --> 41:18.670
Let's do it.
Okay.

41:20.670 --> 41:23.570
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

41:37.260 --> 41:40.160
Doesn't look like
much is going on.

41:51.770 --> 41:54.070
No. I don't like it.

41:54.070 --> 41:56.410
It's too quiet.

41:56.410 --> 41:57.780
Call for backup.

41:57.780 --> 41:59.010
All right.

42:23.800 --> 42:24.970
Yeah, it's Trivette.

42:24.970 --> 42:27.170
We're out here at slip 93.

42:27.170 --> 42:28.640
Why don't you send
a couple units out.

42:28.640 --> 42:30.040
It's looking kind of hokey.
