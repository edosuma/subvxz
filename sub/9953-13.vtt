WEBVTT

00:01.460 --> 00:02.745
- Previously on Haven...

00:02.920 --> 00:05.787
If I go into that barn
when the Hunter meteor storm hits,

00:05.964 --> 00:08.080
the Troubles disappear,
but then so do |.

00:08.258 --> 00:09.293
- The Guard wants Audrey
in the barn tomorrow.

00:09.468 --> 00:12.210
- Audrey's going in that barn
over my dead body.

00:12.387 --> 00:13.672
- Tell me about Sarah.

00:13.847 --> 00:16.054
- You know, you always come back
with a different name,

00:16.225 --> 00:18.716
but underneath,
you're always somehow the same.

00:18.894 --> 00:21.135
- There's a skinwalker in Haven?

00:21.313 --> 00:23.599
- We discovered the skinwalker
was stealing parts of women's faces,

00:23.774 --> 00:26.686
building a custom model;
someone special.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.100
- Arla Cogan?

00:28.278 --> 00:30.610
- Skinwalker's building
the Colorado Kid's wife.

00:30.739 --> 00:33.276
- You can't stop the troubles.
Only Audrey can.

00:33.450 --> 00:35.532
- There is another way.
(clangs)

00:35.702 --> 00:37.818
- Tell me about this other way,
I'll let you go.

00:38.288 --> 00:39.789
(gun clicks)

00:40.582 --> 00:43.619
- Lucy said she'd bring James and l
into the barn with her.

00:43.752 --> 00:45.162
- So, Lucy left you behind.

00:45.337 --> 00:48.420
- You take me to James,

00:48.549 --> 00:51.006
and you won't ever have to worry
about me again.

00:51.134 --> 00:53.967
- What makes you think
that I'm gonna let you near my son?

00:54.137 --> 00:55.798
- Because if you don't,

00:55.973 --> 00:58.385
everyone you love will die.

00:59.351 --> 01:01.216
- Where do you wanna go, James?

01:13.699 --> 01:15.530
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Just saying it's possible.

01:20.247 --> 01:21.532
Danny!

01:24.918 --> 01:25.998
Damn it.

01:26.128 --> 01:28.790
Had to be Arla that did this.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.583
- She's got Audrey now.

01:30.716 --> 01:33.207
Okay, meteor storm started last night.

01:33.385 --> 01:36.798
That means they gotta be looking
for that damn barn.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.795
lf Audrey goes in...

01:38.932 --> 01:40.968
- Troubles are gone.

01:42.519 --> 01:43.975
- That's what you're thinking?

01:44.104 --> 01:46.595
You're not worried that we might have
just lost Audrey forever?

01:46.773 --> 01:49.230
You're thinking that today might be
the day the Troubles stop?

01:51.445 --> 01:52.651
- Hey, wait!

01:54.114 --> 01:56.105
Did you feel that?

01:56.241 --> 01:57.617
- No.

01:57.743 --> 02:01.327
- Which means that the Troubles
are still here.

02:02.414 --> 02:04.996
That means that Audrey
hasn't gone in the barn yet.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.331
Come on.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.325
They're looking for the barn, right?

02:08.462 --> 02:11.875
Now, if Arla put a gun
to Audrey's head,

02:12.007 --> 02:15.465
and she had to lead her somewhere,
where would she take her?

02:15.594 --> 02:17.676
Where?
- l...

02:19.848 --> 02:22.681
Parker and l were just talking about where
the other Audrey lost her memories,

02:22.851 --> 02:24.261
a field with the imprint in it.

02:24.436 --> 02:26.142
- Yeah, okay.
- Like a building had been there.

02:26.313 --> 02:27.894
- Out at Kick 'Em Jenny Neck.
- Yeah.

02:28.065 --> 02:30.147
- Can only get there by boat.
We'll take mine.

02:32.444 --> 02:34.230
If someone hadn't stolen it.

02:34.321 --> 02:36.733
- Arla.
- Damn it!

02:39.159 --> 02:41.696
- I don't know what kind of relationship
you had with my son.

02:41.828 --> 02:44.160
- We're married.
We're in love.

02:44.289 --> 02:47.031
- Till I tell him that
you're a psycho serial killer.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.158
- Shh.
(chirping)

02:51.963 --> 02:54.170
White-Breasted Nuthatch.

02:54.299 --> 02:56.836
Likes to climb, not fly.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.422
Odd bird.

03:07.688 --> 03:08.723
Hello, Audrey.

03:08.897 --> 03:11.058
- Agent Howard.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.182
Or whoever the hell you are.

03:13.318 --> 03:14.899
- Looking for the barn, right?

03:15.070 --> 03:17.686
Come on.
I'll take you there.

03:17.823 --> 03:20.155
- No, you'll take us there.

03:20.283 --> 03:22.865
- Ah. You must be Arla.

03:23.870 --> 03:26.987
| just left James Cogan
at Haven Joe's Bakery.

03:27.124 --> 03:30.366
- He's alive? Is he okay?
- Confused.

03:30.502 --> 03:32.493
Had no idea
how much time had passed.

03:32.629 --> 03:35.666
Kept wondering
what happened to pay phones.

03:35.799 --> 03:38.415
He's still there.
Go to him.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.632
Here.

03:42.764 --> 03:46.097
Say hi to him on his new cellphone.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.342
(ringing)

03:55.068 --> 03:56.604
- James.
- Arla, is that you?

03:56.737 --> 03:59.149
- Ah... James, baby. It's me.

03:59.281 --> 04:00.566
- I wanna talk to him.

04:00.699 --> 04:03.441
- I'll be right there.
I can't wait to see you.

04:03.577 --> 04:06.614
- I can’t wait to see you too, baby.
(phone beeps)

04:08.540 --> 04:10.076
- I don't need you anymore.

04:10.250 --> 04:13.458
If you make one move to follow me,
I will shoot you dead.

04:19.468 --> 04:22.301
- Come. We'll chat a bit.

04:32.189 --> 04:34.555
May I offer you some tea?

04:35.776 --> 04:37.312
- Who the hell are you?

04:37.444 --> 04:40.902
- Think of me as your ride.

04:41.031 --> 04:44.194
I drop you off,
and then when the time is right,

04:45.285 --> 04:46.274
I pick you up.

04:46.453 --> 04:47.693
- In a barn?

04:47.829 --> 04:49.410
- Yes.

04:49.539 --> 04:50.654
Look.

04:51.500 --> 04:54.663
Well, it's quite a bit more
than a barn.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.787
- How did that get here?
- It comes whenever you're looking for it.

04:59.216 --> 05:00.922
It comes when you're ready.

05:03.386 --> 05:04.796
- Okay, so that's it?

05:04.971 --> 05:08.134
I go into the barn,
and then the Troubles end for 27 years?

05:08.266 --> 05:10.473
- Mm... Not that simple.

05:10.602 --> 05:13.093
If it was, I could just pick you up
and throw you in.

05:13.230 --> 05:14.345
- No.

05:14.981 --> 05:16.232
You couldn't.

05:19.528 --> 05:21.314
- You have to want to go in.

05:22.072 --> 05:23.983
You have to want to go away.

05:24.783 --> 05:27.399
That's what allows the Troubles
to end for 27 years.

05:27.577 --> 05:31.365
- Well, then, see,
that's where we have a problem, Morpheus.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.951
I don't want to go away.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.034
- You'll be back to Haven.

05:37.212 --> 05:39.123
- Yeah, but as somebody else, right?

05:40.632 --> 05:42.873
Audrey Parker goes away.

05:44.678 --> 05:45.963
Audrey...

05:48.139 --> 05:49.345
Dies.

05:50.934 --> 05:52.470
- Yes.

05:52.602 --> 05:55.685
- But I don't want Audrey to die.

05:56.815 --> 05:57.930
- Okay.

05:59.818 --> 06:01.854
Go and try to figure out
the way to stay.

06:01.987 --> 06:03.193
- What?

06:04.698 --> 06:05.813
I can just go?

06:05.949 --> 06:07.689
- Yes.

06:07.826 --> 06:10.238
But know this, Audrey.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.531
The sky is starting to fall.

06:12.664 --> 06:15.030
While you're out there
attempting the impossible,

06:15.166 --> 06:16.667
trying to stay,

06:16.793 --> 06:19.205
it will continue to fall
faster and faster,

06:19.337 --> 06:23.956
until the town and everyone
you love in it have been destroyed.

06:26.344 --> 06:28.721
Now, go.

06:28.847 --> 06:29.962
Your friends are here.

06:30.098 --> 06:32.635
(Nathan): Audrey!
- Over here!

06:37.272 --> 06:39.308
- You're okay.
(Audrey gasping)

06:42.193 --> 06:43.933
- How did you get here?

06:45.196 --> 06:46.276
- Duke stole a boat.

06:46.406 --> 06:49.148
- Borrowed.
Where's Arla?

06:49.284 --> 06:50.865
- She's gone, but Howard, he...

06:56.041 --> 06:57.577
The barn is gone.

06:58.543 --> 07:00.079
I gotta find Arla.

07:00.211 --> 07:01.951
She has my son.

07:02.839 --> 07:04.955
(whooshing)

07:10.347 --> 07:12.429
- l'm... I'm sure that it's me,

07:12.557 --> 07:15.799
but I thought the meteors
are supposed to pass over Haven.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.598
Wha... Why is it hitting us?

07:18.730 --> 07:20.721
- Because I won't go in the barn.

07:20.857 --> 07:23.098
And they're gonna come
faster and faster

07:23.234 --> 07:26.601
until I find my son
and he tells us how to stop this.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.566
(theme music)

08:00.105 --> 08:02.016
(siren wailing)

08:03.191 --> 08:05.273
(woman): Found him yet?

08:05.402 --> 08:07.438
- Vince.
You got that 2—ton Jack?

08:07.612 --> 08:09.648
A guy on Barkhouse Drive
is trapped under a wall.

08:09.781 --> 08:11.146
Said his house exploded.

08:11.282 --> 08:13.364
- The Hunter Storm has begun.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.984
(muffled groan, thumping)

08:16.121 --> 08:17.782
Uh, you don't wanna know.

08:17.914 --> 08:19.245
- Yeah, I do.

08:19.374 --> 08:21.285
(sighs)

08:21.418 --> 08:23.079
-Oh...

08:28.967 --> 08:30.503
(muffled speech)

08:31.886 --> 08:35.014
I had to do it.
He's lost his mind.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.721
Yesterday, we had Arla
the skinwalker tied up,

08:36.850 --> 08:39.136
but Dave hit me over the head
and set her free.

08:39.269 --> 08:40.805
It's too dangerous right now.

08:40.937 --> 08:42.473
(people screaming)

08:44.816 --> 08:47.057
- Vince, there's meteors falling.
What if there's a fire?

08:47.235 --> 08:49.317
Dave can't be dangerous enough
to keep locked in a trunk.

08:49.487 --> 08:50.602
Let him out.

08:50.780 --> 08:52.771
- Oh, maybe you're right.

08:52.907 --> 08:54.238
(siren approaching)

08:57.620 --> 08:59.747
(engine starting)
(groans)

09:00.665 --> 09:02.906
(muffled shouts)
Sorry, Dave.

09:06.504 --> 09:08.165
- All right.
- Thanks.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.378
- My skiff was abandoned
at South Down Docks.

09:12.510 --> 09:14.626
James and Arla left it.

09:14.763 --> 09:17.095
- Ah... Waiter didn't see a car,
doesn't know where they went.

09:17.223 --> 09:20.135
- He said James was really sick,
that he's getting worse and worse.

09:20.268 --> 09:23.305
- If the barn kept him alive,
maybe he can't leave it.

09:24.189 --> 09:26.225
(siren wails, horn honks)

09:26.274 --> 09:28.105
- The whole town
is getting bombarded.

09:28.234 --> 09:29.565
- I'll put out an APB.

09:29.694 --> 09:31.855
Contact all the hospitals, doctors...
we'll find him.

09:31.988 --> 09:33.944
- I'm gonna check the security
cameras at the docks.

09:34.115 --> 09:36.322
You know,
maybe they swiped another boat.

09:36.493 --> 09:38.199
(man): I'm sorry, folks,
this entrance is closed off.

09:38.369 --> 09:40.200
(indistinct chatter)

09:40.371 --> 09:42.498
(people chattering)

09:47.879 --> 09:49.585
(coughing)

09:52.550 --> 09:54.290
- Okay.
(James mumbling)

09:54.469 --> 09:57.836
I'll run you a cool bath, okay?
That'll help get the fever down.

09:58.223 --> 10:00.930
- Ah... I don't feel right.

10:01.059 --> 10:04.267
- You're probablyjust not used
to all the modern bugs.

10:04.395 --> 10:06.681
It's all genetically-modified foods now.

10:07.982 --> 10:10.439
- Ah... I hope so.

10:10.568 --> 10:12.945
I can't believe
I've been gone for so long.

10:13.071 --> 10:16.279
- Don't worry.
I'll help you settle in again.

10:17.075 --> 10:19.066
Things aren't so different.

10:19.202 --> 10:21.693
- Arla.
- Yeah?

10:23.748 --> 10:27.957
- If I've been gone for 27 years, then...

10:28.086 --> 10:30.748
why do you still look so young?

10:33.091 --> 10:35.582
- I stayed young for you, silly.

10:37.178 --> 10:39.009
Now hush.

10:39.514 --> 10:40.924
We have to get you well

10:41.099 --> 10:43.806
so we can get you outta here
before your mother finds us.

10:43.935 --> 10:45.971
(coughing)

10:49.107 --> 10:50.688
Hey.

10:50.859 --> 10:53.350
- All this time
and she's still after me.

10:54.571 --> 10:57.153
(sighs)
I guess I understand why.

10:57.282 --> 11:01.025
- That doesn't make it right.
Okay, we have our lives to live too.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.152
I won't let her hurt you again.

11:04.289 --> 11:05.825
- I love you so much.

11:07.709 --> 11:09.825
- I love you too, baby.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.620
(cellphone ringing)

11:19.470 --> 11:21.381
(ringing)

11:25.143 --> 11:27.008
- What?
- You have a problem.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.927
I hear your James is sick.

11:29.063 --> 11:31.395
- How do you know that?
- How do you think I know?

11:31.524 --> 11:33.480
Audrey Parker's running around
looking for you.

11:33.610 --> 11:36.852
- She's not in the barn?
- No. You see, you can tell

11:36.988 --> 11:39.855
by the car-sized rocks
falling from the sky.

11:41.117 --> 11:43.233
And she's not going in
until she finds James.

11:43.411 --> 11:45.652
So maybe there ’3 a way
we can both get what we need.

11:45.830 --> 11:47.366
You want James better, right?

11:47.498 --> 11:49.079
- You can't do that.

11:49.667 --> 11:50.998
- But the barn can.

11:51.169 --> 11:52.705
- I don't know where the barn is.

11:52.837 --> 11:54.919
- Audrey can summon the barn.

11:55.965 --> 11:58.377
And she'll do it to save James
just like she did before.

11:58.509 --> 12:00.465
- Why should I trust you, Crocker?

12:00.595 --> 12:03.007
- 'Cause I know that Audrey
has to go in the barn.

12:03.139 --> 12:04.379
(whooshing)

12:06.017 --> 12:07.427
(rumble, siren wails)

12:07.602 --> 12:10.309
I'm tired of living
in a disaster movie.

12:12.023 --> 12:13.604
Troubles have to stop.

12:15.485 --> 12:17.521
You just meet me and bring James.

12:20.198 --> 12:21.529
I'll take care of the rest.

12:23.910 --> 12:27.744
(muffled shouting, banging)

12:28.665 --> 12:30.371
- Damn it, Vince.

12:35.213 --> 12:36.544
(muffled speech)
(clanging metal)

12:39.092 --> 12:40.832
(grunts)

12:42.470 --> 12:44.836
- I know what Vince told you,
but he lied, Dwight.

12:45.014 --> 12:47.847
- So, you didn't free Arla?
- Not really the point.

12:48.017 --> 12:50.303
Vince knows that I'll try
to keep Audrey out of the barn,

12:50.478 --> 12:51.684
and that's why he tied me up.

12:51.854 --> 12:54.937
- So, Vince wants her to go in?
Thought he liked Audrey.

12:55.066 --> 12:56.977
- He loves her.

12:57.110 --> 12:59.977
But he says he has to be practical.

13:00.113 --> 13:03.822
Big coward, if you ask me.
The little guy's got all the fight in him.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.235
- What are you talking about?

13:05.368 --> 13:09.111
- Vince and I tried to keep Sarah
out of the barn once before.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.745
Let's just say it didn't work.

13:10.915 --> 13:12.530
Vince decided there and then

13:12.709 --> 13:15.951
that the best thing for everyone
is for Audrey to just keep going back in.

13:17.672 --> 13:20.334
I think we have to break
the damn cycle.

13:20.466 --> 13:22.377
We have to face the situation head on,

13:22.510 --> 13:24.296
deal with the damn Troubles,

13:24.429 --> 13:26.966
and not just keep using
that poor girl as a band-aid.

13:28.391 --> 13:30.723
- Any idea where we can find Vince?

13:30.852 --> 13:34.811
- Oh, yeah.
I always know how to find my brother.

13:36.399 --> 13:39.106
- I told you Audrey could bring the barn.

13:39.193 --> 13:41.354
We'll have to be careful.
She's close by.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.690
(grunts)
What's wrong with him?

13:43.823 --> 13:46.314
-|dunno.
But this barn saved him last time.

13:46.451 --> 13:49.193
We just have to get him better,
and then we'll figure it out.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.660
Right, baby?

13:50.788 --> 13:52.289
Just like we always do, huh?

13:52.415 --> 13:53.996
You'll be okay.

13:54.125 --> 13:56.491
Okay.
(James grunts)

14:00.256 --> 14:02.087
- I did it for us.

14:03.343 --> 14:04.958
You ever been in love, Crocker?

14:06.679 --> 14:07.885
- No.

14:08.014 --> 14:10.050
- Well, if you had,
then you'd understand.

14:13.311 --> 14:14.346
- Duke?

14:15.021 --> 14:16.136
- Don't move.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.101
Crocker, get their guns.

14:20.735 --> 14:22.817
You're gonna take him inside of the barn,
make him better,

14:22.987 --> 14:25.603
and then bring him back out to me.
- No.

14:25.740 --> 14:28.106
- Oh, you will.

14:28.242 --> 14:30.449
And by the way,
if you don't come back this time...

14:34.332 --> 14:37.540
l'll blow Nathan's brains out.
- No.

14:38.628 --> 14:40.164
You won't.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.670
Remember when you were Tommy?

14:43.800 --> 14:45.586
Gave me that gun
with no bullets in it?

14:49.138 --> 14:50.548
I didn't forget that.

14:51.849 --> 14:53.180
(gun clicks)

14:57.897 --> 15:00.183
- You used me to bring James to her.

15:00.316 --> 15:02.056
- Yahtzee.

15:03.277 --> 15:05.233
- I thought you wanted
the Troubles to stop?

15:05.363 --> 15:06.694
-ldo.

15:08.366 --> 15:10.357
I want Audrey to stick around too.

15:12.036 --> 15:13.742
It seems your James
is the only one who knows

15:13.913 --> 15:16.575
how to make both those things happen.

15:17.875 --> 15:19.661
- James?

15:20.169 --> 15:21.420
James.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.256
Hello.

15:24.382 --> 15:26.122
Hey, can you hear me?

15:28.886 --> 15:30.387
It's your mother.

15:34.600 --> 15:37.592
He's not okay.
He's fading.

15:37.728 --> 15:38.888
- Bring him into the barn.

15:39.021 --> 15:40.522
It can save his life.

15:40.648 --> 15:43.856
- Parker, if you go in there,

15:44.527 --> 15:45.733
you might never come out.

15:45.903 --> 15:48.110
- Howard said this barn
only comes when I'm ready.

15:48.239 --> 15:50.776
Maybe it only disappears
when I'm ready to leave.

15:52.535 --> 15:55.993
And I'm not ready to leave...
either of you.

16:00.042 --> 16:01.623
(coughing)

16:01.752 --> 16:03.083
- Hey!

16:04.922 --> 16:08.130
- Nathan, l have to go after him.
He's my only chance.

16:09.177 --> 16:11.008
- Then I'm going with you.

16:11.137 --> 16:12.377
- Me too.

16:12.513 --> 16:13.923
- You're not leaving me out here again.

16:14.056 --> 16:15.216
- You're not going in.

16:15.391 --> 16:18.724
- How are you gonna stop me
once you're inside the barn?

16:18.895 --> 16:21.853
- I guess someone's gonna have
to stay out here and watch the skin quilt.

16:23.858 --> 16:24.893
Nathan...

16:26.152 --> 16:28.689
You make sure she comes back out.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.150
- | Will.

16:38.039 --> 16:39.199
- Ready?

16:40.041 --> 16:42.407
- What's the big deal?
It's just a barn.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.938
Love what Howard's done with the place.

17:10.988 --> 17:12.819
- What is this thing?

17:27.213 --> 17:28.703
- Parker...

17:31.926 --> 17:33.211
I can feel.

17:34.845 --> 17:37.177
My skin, the air, everything.

17:38.516 --> 17:41.132
- Must be this place.

17:41.269 --> 17:44.306
- Whatever's going on
with the Troubles with Haven, this...

17:45.690 --> 17:47.396
barn is at the center of it.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.393
We need to take it out.

17:52.530 --> 17:54.566
Solves all our problems.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.942
You can't get trapped in here
if we blow it up.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.363
(rumbling)

18:02.665 --> 18:04.121
- What just happened?

18:05.209 --> 18:06.710
- Huh?
(car approaches)

18:19.849 --> 18:21.259
- That's me.

18:21.392 --> 18:22.802
- No.

18:24.312 --> 18:25.267
That's Sarah.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.349
- Sarah?

18:27.481 --> 18:29.517
I don't think they can see us.

18:29.650 --> 18:31.356
- Are we in the 1950s?

18:31.485 --> 18:33.976
- The barn transported us back in time?

18:35.406 --> 18:38.273
- Don't tell me what to do.
- So don't drop it, Vincent.

18:38.409 --> 18:40.616
You're shaking, your hands are shaking.
Just take your time.

18:40.745 --> 18:42.110
Focus.
- Don't touch it.

18:42.246 --> 18:43.486
- Focus.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.830
- Is that Vince and Dave?
- Listen to 'em arguing.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.539
- Guess some things never change.

18:47.668 --> 18:51.035
- Will you quit breathing down my neck?
- Well, you're shaking. Stop shaking.

18:51.172 --> 18:53.788
- It's like we're watching a scene
from the past.

18:53.924 --> 18:55.334
- Hurry up.

18:55.468 --> 18:59.336
- Or it's a memory.
What if it's one of Sarah's memories?

18:59.472 --> 19:02.179
- Good. Come, come!
Go, go, go, go, go!

19:04.560 --> 19:06.175
(ticking)
(gasping)

19:19.492 --> 19:22.484
- It did nothing.
It's completely intact.

19:22.620 --> 19:25.487
This old barn should be splinters.

19:25.623 --> 19:27.204
- This is more than a barn.

19:35.591 --> 19:37.707
But I guess I have to go.

19:41.138 --> 19:42.514
- Was he with his father?

19:42.640 --> 19:45.177
- James's father?

19:47.395 --> 19:49.431
He's not even born yet.

19:51.649 --> 19:53.605
- Not even born?

19:53.776 --> 19:55.266
(ethereal whooshing)

20:01.200 --> 20:03.441
We were talking about blowing up
the barn earlier.

20:03.577 --> 20:05.863
Maybe Howard overheard us.

20:07.748 --> 20:10.660
- You're right, Audrey.
That was Sarah's memory.

20:10.793 --> 20:12.249
- That you showed to us.

20:13.421 --> 20:16.584
- You're not taking Audrey away.
- Oh, it can't be stopped.

20:17.466 --> 20:19.047
That's what I was trying to show you.

20:19.176 --> 20:21.508
- How do we know
that memory's even real?

20:24.223 --> 20:27.932
- How 'bout | show you a memory of Sarah's
that you know is real, Nathan?

20:32.857 --> 20:34.142
- I don't like that.

20:36.402 --> 20:39.235
- Okay, so he just said that it would be
one of Sarah's memories

20:39.405 --> 20:43.148
that you remember,
which means it's gotta be 1955.

20:43.868 --> 20:46.484
That's when you went back in time
to find...

20:46.620 --> 20:48.451
to find Duke, right?

20:48.622 --> 20:50.704
Don't you have a jacket like that?
- Yeah.

20:50.875 --> 20:52.536
That's weird.

20:52.918 --> 20:56.001
Uh, I don't think James is up that way.

20:57.965 --> 20:59.671
Parker...

20:59.800 --> 21:01.381
Audrey, wait.

21:35.753 --> 21:39.416
- Oh... my... God.

21:40.674 --> 21:43.586
- I didn't know
if I was ever coming back.

21:53.854 --> 21:54.934
- He's here.

21:57.691 --> 21:59.773
James!

22:00.611 --> 22:02.852
James!

22:04.532 --> 22:06.068
- Parker?

22:06.909 --> 22:08.365
Parker!

22:10.913 --> 22:12.119
Parker!

22:13.958 --> 22:15.949
What the hell is going on?

22:28.848 --> 22:30.509
Audrey.

22:31.308 --> 22:32.343
- Who are you?

22:36.021 --> 22:38.933
- Nathan. Nathan Wuornos.

22:42.528 --> 22:44.314
I'm your father.

22:52.121 --> 22:54.112
- Always wondered who you were.

22:59.086 --> 23:02.453
- This would be weird
even if we weren't meeting in a giant,

23:02.631 --> 23:04.462
supernatural steam room.

23:08.262 --> 23:09.968
We've been looking for you.

23:11.432 --> 23:12.547
Audrey and l.

23:12.725 --> 23:14.807
- What, so she can kill me?
- What?

23:14.935 --> 23:16.391
- Again?

23:17.855 --> 23:21.393
Kill her son to save herself.
- What are you talking about?

23:21.525 --> 23:25.609
- When I came to Haven
to find my mother Sarah,

23:25.738 --> 23:27.103
I found Lucy instead.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.276
She was... frantic.

23:30.492 --> 23:32.699
She'd just found out
that she was about to disappear.

23:35.039 --> 23:37.872
And I said,
"There's gotta be another way."

23:38.375 --> 23:40.366
- What did you find out?
What's the other way?

23:40.502 --> 23:41.833
- Me.

23:42.671 --> 23:45.663
My death was the only thing
that could keep her out of the barn.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.961
- But Audr...

23:49.094 --> 23:52.552
Lucy never would've hurt you,
not even to save herself.

23:53.515 --> 23:55.847
- The day l was supposed to leave Haven,

23:55.976 --> 23:59.468
somebody snuck up
and bashed me in the back of the head.

24:00.272 --> 24:01.978
Arla found out it was my mom.

24:02.107 --> 24:03.483
- Arla lied.

24:04.318 --> 24:07.435
Lucy still went in that barn.
There has to be another explanation.

24:07.571 --> 24:10.108
- Well, maybe you don't know your Audrey
as well as you think.

24:10.240 --> 24:11.446
(scoffs)
(Audrey): Nathan?

24:11.575 --> 24:12.985
(footsteps approaching)

24:13.827 --> 24:15.158
- Parker.

24:15.287 --> 24:17.403
Good. You have to talk to...

24:20.834 --> 24:22.335
- Talk to who?

24:23.212 --> 24:24.702
- I saw James.

24:28.759 --> 24:30.966
- I need to know
what's going on in there.

24:31.095 --> 24:32.505
- Settle down.

24:33.305 --> 24:36.263
You're not the only one with somebody
inside this damn thing.

24:38.727 --> 24:40.263
- You love Audrey, don't you?

24:41.689 --> 24:43.395
At least admit it to yourself.

24:43.524 --> 24:44.855
- Shut up.

24:44.984 --> 24:47.020
I'm not taking advice
from a walking purse.

24:50.572 --> 24:53.359
Hey!
- Relax, Crocker.

24:54.159 --> 24:56.411
If we wanted to kill you,
this would be over already.

24:56.662 --> 24:58.243
- How'd you find the barn?

24:58.372 --> 25:01.489
- We had every member of the Guard
looking for it. Now where is Parker?

25:01.667 --> 25:03.999
- She's inside.
- Did I say you could speak?

25:04.128 --> 25:05.834
- She's already gone in.

25:05.963 --> 25:07.078
Good.

25:07.297 --> 25:09.674
- Think we're gonna wait here with you.

25:09.800 --> 25:12.007
Make sure Audrey's
still in there when it leaves.

25:12.136 --> 25:14.092
- If any of you come for this gun,

25:15.347 --> 25:18.714
l'll separate at least three of you from
your Troubles before anyone touches me.

25:20.310 --> 25:22.767
- This isn't about you, Duke.

25:22.896 --> 25:25.353
When this is over,
we can all just walk away.

25:25.482 --> 25:27.518
- Hell hath no fury, eh, Jordan?

25:27.651 --> 25:30.142
- I'm not here because of Nathan.

25:31.488 --> 25:32.568
- Right.

25:32.740 --> 25:36.653
- When that barn disappears,
my Trouble goes with it.

25:36.785 --> 25:38.992
I'll be able to touch people,
be touched.

25:39.872 --> 25:43.364
ljust want to be normal again, Duke.
I'd think you'd want it too.

25:44.084 --> 25:47.827
- He'd rather have Audrey.
- I told you, shut up!

25:49.339 --> 25:52.502
- Both you and Nathan...

25:52.634 --> 25:54.886
in love with a woman
neither of you can have.

25:56.764 --> 25:58.629
Um! It's almost...

25:58.807 --> 25:59.922
sad.

26:06.440 --> 26:08.271
- He's your son, isn't he?

26:08.400 --> 26:09.981
- Our son.

26:16.700 --> 26:18.907
- Why didn't you tell me?

26:19.036 --> 26:22.995
- Ah... Not exactly sure
how that conversation would've gone.

26:25.834 --> 26:29.543
I guess it was a way to...
be with you.

26:33.425 --> 26:34.881
I know that...

26:35.302 --> 26:36.587
sounds crazy.

26:37.638 --> 26:38.844
- No.

26:41.350 --> 26:43.181
It doesn't.

26:46.355 --> 26:48.141
Part of me's glad.
(scoffs)

26:48.273 --> 26:52.767
At least this way, if I do disappear,
l have some proof that l existed.

26:52.903 --> 26:55.064
- You're not disappearing.

26:55.239 --> 26:56.445
Not this time.

26:58.033 --> 26:59.239
- What did James tell you?

26:59.409 --> 27:02.446
- James thinks he's the answer.

27:02.579 --> 27:03.910
He thinks...

27:04.915 --> 27:08.203
that somehow killing him
ends the Troubles.

27:09.920 --> 27:14.129
We need to find James.
Figure out what really happened to him.

27:17.594 --> 27:18.800
- Howard?

27:20.514 --> 27:23.221
I know you're hiding somewhere.
I know you can hear me.

27:25.102 --> 27:29.641
I'm not making my choice
until you show me my son.

27:29.815 --> 27:31.055
- Okay.

27:32.693 --> 27:35.150
He's right there.

27:35.279 --> 27:37.611
-Oh...

27:38.824 --> 27:40.485
James.

27:42.286 --> 27:44.197
It's so good to finally meet you.

27:46.039 --> 27:48.826
- Where's Arla?
I wanna see her.

27:48.959 --> 27:51.075
- James, there are things about Arla
that you do not know.

27:51.211 --> 27:52.951
- I want to talk to Arla!
- James...

27:54.256 --> 27:57.498
- James, stop.
- Ah... Okay, that hurt.

28:02.598 --> 28:05.055
- You wanna see Arla?
All right.

28:05.184 --> 28:07.425
I'll go bring her to you.

28:20.616 --> 28:23.904
(gunshot)
- Oh! Ah...

28:32.419 --> 28:33.875
Really, Vince?

28:35.547 --> 28:37.788
- Oh, no.
They're just tranquilizers.

28:37.925 --> 28:40.792
I don't want to hurt him,
but I can't let him stop Audrey.

28:40.928 --> 28:42.964
- He wants Audrey
to go back into the barn.

28:43.096 --> 28:44.085
(whooshing)

28:46.683 --> 28:47.843
(rumbling)

28:48.018 --> 28:50.805
- Because I want the Troubles to end.
I want this to end!

28:50.979 --> 28:52.515
- Nobody wants the Troubles
to end more than I do.

28:52.689 --> 28:54.304
My little girl died because of them,

28:54.483 --> 28:56.348
but this can't keep happening
over and over.

28:56.526 --> 28:59.188
- Vincent, what if Audrey
can find a way to change things?

28:59.321 --> 29:02.734
- We tried before.
- Doesn't mean we can't try again!

29:12.292 --> 29:13.532
- Vince?

29:13.669 --> 29:15.034
Look, get outta here
before you get hurt.

29:15.170 --> 29:16.876
- Take the men and go.

29:17.798 --> 29:20.961
- But...
- Guns are not gonna solve this, Kirk.

29:21.093 --> 29:23.709
Go home.
- Yes, sir.

29:23.887 --> 29:26.299
- What?
Why are you listening to him?

29:26.431 --> 29:27.682
- 'Cause he's the boss.

29:27.808 --> 29:29.514
We're leaving.

29:37.651 --> 29:39.266
- You're in the Guard.

29:42.698 --> 29:45.565
- They work for me.
Always have.

29:47.452 --> 29:49.317
- That explains a few things.

29:49.454 --> 29:52.491
- Vince, please.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.785
You're going to make sure
Audrey goes away, right?

29:56.253 --> 29:58.494
- It'll be her choice.
- I've lost too much.

29:58.630 --> 30:00.040
I won't let it all be for nothing.

30:00.173 --> 30:01.583
- Leave now, Jordan.

30:07.723 --> 30:09.634
- So, what does this mean for us, Vince?

30:10.767 --> 30:11.756
That tattoo...

30:11.935 --> 30:15.393
- I'm not gonna kill you, Duke.
- I appreciate that.

30:15.522 --> 30:17.854
- In fact, I'm the reason
the others never went after you.

30:17.983 --> 30:19.814
And believe me, they wanted to.

30:26.783 --> 30:28.569
- James wants to see you.

30:30.746 --> 30:32.156
- I thought he might.

30:40.255 --> 30:41.916
James.

30:44.801 --> 30:46.666
Hush, it's all right.

30:50.432 --> 30:53.299
What? What's wrong?

30:58.982 --> 31:01.894
- Troubles don't work in here.
(James stammering)

31:02.027 --> 31:03.608
- What happened to you?

31:03.737 --> 31:07.901
- After you died, okay,
my Trouble started.

31:08.033 --> 31:09.569
And my skin fell off.

31:09.701 --> 31:12.192
But H can live inside the skin
of other people.

31:12.329 --> 31:13.489
- Tell him, Arla.

31:15.582 --> 31:18.449
Tell him how many women you murdered
to get that skin.

31:18.710 --> 31:22.168
- You murdered people?
That's how you're able to look so young?

31:22.422 --> 31:24.663
- Babe, I... I did it for you.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.131
- Don't touch me!

31:27.803 --> 31:29.885
- I waited for you.

31:30.013 --> 31:32.504
I killed for you.
I killed for us!

31:32.641 --> 31:34.506
- You killed... what?
Oh, my God!

31:34.643 --> 31:37.100
(shouting in rage)
(panting)

31:46.363 --> 31:48.604
- Ruined everything!
- Don't! No! Hey!

31:54.788 --> 31:56.119
- Oh!

31:57.416 --> 31:58.997
- This is your fault!

32:02.712 --> 32:03.963
(Arla gasping)

32:21.481 --> 32:23.472
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

32:23.608 --> 32:25.860
Just get her out of the barn,
it might bring her back to life.

32:26.027 --> 32:28.769
James.
James, it's gonna be all right.

32:35.120 --> 32:38.362
Well, the barn saved you last time.
lt'll fix you again.

32:41.293 --> 32:44.160
- Arla lied.
- Yeah.

32:44.296 --> 32:46.036
- You didn't kill me.

32:46.173 --> 32:49.665
- No. Why would...
why would I wanna kill you?

32:49.801 --> 32:52.087
- 'Cause then the Troubles...

32:54.264 --> 32:56.425
But then I guess
that didn't happen, did it?

32:57.392 --> 33:00.134
- Why would killing you...
why would that end the Troubles?

33:00.270 --> 33:02.727
- Because you loved me.

33:04.483 --> 33:07.850
L-Lucy said that killing
someone she loved

33:07.986 --> 33:09.692
was the only way
to end the Troubles.

33:09.863 --> 33:14.152
Not... not just for 27 years,
but forever.

33:15.118 --> 33:17.200
Haven would be a true Haven again.

33:20.040 --> 33:21.280
- What?

33:23.627 --> 33:26.414
- But you're not Lucy anymore.
- Um...

33:26.546 --> 33:29.379
- But we just met,
so you don't love me.

33:29.633 --> 33:30.964
- Hey...

33:33.512 --> 33:35.924
- Who do you love, Audrey?

33:40.602 --> 33:42.467
(James breathing erratically)

33:51.780 --> 33:52.986
- Ready to go?

34:03.291 --> 34:04.701
- Why?

34:04.876 --> 34:07.834
- That meteor storm is about to pound Haven
from the face--

34:08.004 --> 34:11.167
- I'm not talking
about the meteor storm.

34:11.299 --> 34:12.630
I'm talking about me.

34:12.759 --> 34:15.045
My choices.
(Audrey scoffs)

34:18.557 --> 34:20.513
Where's James?

34:20.642 --> 34:23.509
- Healing.
That's what you wanted.

34:23.645 --> 34:26.352
- No, I want him to have a life.

34:26.481 --> 34:28.346
The life that I can't have.

34:28.483 --> 34:30.144
- That's impossible.

34:30.277 --> 34:32.233
He belongs here now,
like his mother.

34:32.362 --> 34:36.071
- Why? Why do I belong here?

34:38.743 --> 34:41.780
- Think of the barn
as an amplifier for you.

34:41.913 --> 34:46.156
When you're in it,
your energy keeps the Troubles at bay.

34:46.835 --> 34:50.748
But after 27 years,
that energy starts to run out.

34:50.880 --> 34:53.371
Troubles start again.

34:53.508 --> 34:55.089
So, you have to come out
and recharge.

34:55.260 --> 34:56.796
- Recharge?

34:57.596 --> 34:59.052
Recharge with what?

34:59.180 --> 35:00.841
- Love.

35:01.016 --> 35:03.302
lt energizes you
so you can go back into the barn

35:03.476 --> 35:05.637
and stop the Troubles again.

35:08.398 --> 35:10.184
- Am I even human?

35:10.317 --> 35:12.433
- Audrey...

35:15.322 --> 35:17.028
That's your problem.

35:17.157 --> 35:20.524
You are very, very human.

35:22.996 --> 35:25.533
- So, I'm... l'm Troubled then.

35:26.291 --> 35:27.906
- No.

35:28.043 --> 35:31.831
- Then why do I need to kill the man I love
to end all this?

35:33.006 --> 35:34.712
Am I being punished?

35:35.759 --> 35:37.841
- It does seem that way.

35:37.969 --> 35:39.084
Yes.

35:45.226 --> 35:47.091
- There's gotta be another way.

35:47.228 --> 35:48.434
- I'm sorry.

35:49.898 --> 35:51.763
There are only two ways this ends.

35:51.900 --> 35:54.767
One stops the Trouble for 27 years,
the other...

35:56.821 --> 35:58.197
Forever.

36:01.826 --> 36:04.909
We really... should go now.

36:07.374 --> 36:08.830
- Wait.

36:16.007 --> 36:17.463
I need to say goodbye.

36:29.979 --> 36:31.480
- What did James say?
(whooshing)

36:37.862 --> 36:39.238
- He was wrong.

36:40.156 --> 36:43.569
Killing him... it won't work.

36:50.458 --> 36:51.664
Goodbye, Dwight.

36:51.793 --> 36:53.454
I'm sorry about the mess.

36:53.586 --> 36:55.417
- I got it.

37:00.301 --> 37:03.668
- Audrey, you don't have to go away.

37:03.805 --> 37:05.636
There are other things we can try.

37:05.765 --> 37:07.551
- No, Dave.

37:07.684 --> 37:10.721
lnnocent people will not die
to keep me outta there.

37:16.985 --> 37:20.022
- I thought this might be easier
this time, but...

37:20.989 --> 37:22.149
it's not.

37:25.994 --> 37:27.859
Bye, Audrey.

37:27.996 --> 37:29.987
- Goodbye, Vince.
(rumbling)

37:35.670 --> 37:37.251
(sighs)

37:43.094 --> 37:44.379
Duke...

37:46.723 --> 37:49.681
You have always been so good to me.

37:51.978 --> 37:53.434
- It was easy.

37:56.649 --> 37:58.435
It actually wasn't, but...

38:00.028 --> 38:01.484
you know me:
I like the challenge.

38:02.280 --> 38:05.022
- I'm sorry I won't remember you
when I come back.

38:09.996 --> 38:11.907
Especially Colorado.

38:29.682 --> 38:31.263
- Parker, if we...

38:41.236 --> 38:42.897
No.

38:43.738 --> 38:45.774
This is not goodbye.

38:48.284 --> 38:50.275
Take me with you.
- No. Nathan?

38:50.411 --> 38:52.663
Nathan, I won't be alone, all right?

38:52.789 --> 38:54.029
I'll be with our son.

38:54.165 --> 38:57.578
- I am gonna die before I let you go.

38:58.127 --> 38:59.628
- I know.

39:01.214 --> 39:02.750
Duke...
- Audrey!

39:02.882 --> 39:04.793
- Make sure Nathan does not follow me in.

39:04.926 --> 39:06.632
Promise me.

39:06.761 --> 39:09.252
- Audrey, don't do this.
- Promise me that, Duke.

39:10.265 --> 39:12.881
- I promise, Audrey.
- Audrey, don't do this.

39:13.560 --> 39:15.801
- 27 years, Nathan.

39:15.937 --> 39:18.303
Then we'll get to do it
all over again.

39:20.483 --> 39:22.064
Good bye.

39:22.193 --> 39:25.230
- We're not lettin' her go in there.
- Yes, we are.

39:27.782 --> 39:31.491
Listen!
She's trying to help all these people.

39:31.619 --> 39:34.702
She's trying to help this town,
and it is her choice.

39:35.456 --> 39:36.832
It's not yours.

39:38.626 --> 39:40.708
It's not mine.

39:43.131 --> 39:44.587
I hate it.

39:46.217 --> 39:47.923
But it's still her choice.

39:55.310 --> 39:57.175
- You're in love with her too.

39:59.981 --> 40:01.517
- Yeah.

40:01.649 --> 40:03.480
- Then how can you let her go?

40:05.737 --> 40:07.648
Look at her. Look at her!

40:15.788 --> 40:16.823
(grunts)

40:16.956 --> 40:18.116
Audrey, stop!

40:28.468 --> 40:32.802
- I thought it was made fairly clear.
That won't work on the barn.

40:34.349 --> 40:36.715
- That was made clear.

40:39.854 --> 40:42.015
What about hurting you?

40:49.405 --> 40:50.656
(nervous breathing)

40:50.823 --> 40:52.484
(gunshot)

40:59.499 --> 41:00.830
(indistinct shouting)

41:05.088 --> 41:06.419
(rumbling)

41:19.936 --> 41:21.767
(mumbling)
(Duke): They're not stopping.

41:21.938 --> 41:23.599
They're supposed to stop.

41:24.941 --> 41:26.306
- Get her, Duke.

41:27.568 --> 41:29.559
Go, save her.

41:30.655 --> 41:31.861
- Audrey!

41:39.914 --> 41:42.326
(distant explosions, rumbling)

41:49.799 --> 41:51.289
- Audrey.

42:02.145 --> 42:03.476
Audrey!

42:06.065 --> 42:07.680
Audrey!

42:35.970 --> 42:38.837
Subtitling: CNST, Montreal
