WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:01.502
.

00:01.535 --> 00:02.436
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:03.737 --> 00:05.339
sexually based offenses

00:05.373 --> 00:07.175
are considered
especially heinous.

00:07.208 --> 00:08.609
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.642 --> 00:10.678
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.711 --> 00:12.246
are members of an elite squad

00:12.280 --> 00:14.148
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.182 --> 00:15.816
These are their stories.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.151
[dramatic music]

00:17.185 --> 00:18.286
- Oh, honey, I'm so glad

00:18.319 --> 00:20.054
that you're feeling better.

00:20.088 --> 00:21.822
Yeah.

00:21.855 --> 00:25.126
Yes to applesauce,
all you want,

00:25.159 --> 00:27.795
but no more cartoons,
okay, Noah?

00:27.828 --> 00:30.098
All right, honey, I love you.

00:30.131 --> 00:32.333
Can you put Lucy back on?

00:32.366 --> 00:33.534
Okay.

00:33.567 --> 00:36.737
Hey, Lucy, I'll check in
with you later.

00:36.770 --> 00:38.439
Thank you, bye.

00:39.807 --> 00:40.841
- Noah's all right?

00:40.874 --> 00:43.577
- Yeah, he just has a cold.

00:43.611 --> 00:46.780
But today, of all days.

00:46.814 --> 00:48.316
- I know that this is
stressful,

00:48.349 --> 00:50.584
but you have got nothing
to worry about.

00:50.618 --> 00:52.186
- Then why are we here?

00:52.220 --> 00:54.222
- My best guess?

00:54.255 --> 00:56.290
Judge Linden agreed
to a courtesy hearing

00:56.324 --> 00:58.092
to cover her bases.

00:58.126 --> 01:00.428
She's the one who suggested
you take Noah,

01:00.461 --> 01:03.497
and the circumstances were
a little bit unorthodox.

01:03.531 --> 01:06.767
- Just promise me
I'm not going to lose my son.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.236
- I prom--

01:08.269 --> 01:10.171
- Lieutenant Benson.

01:14.808 --> 01:16.877
[dramatic music]

01:16.910 --> 01:20.281
- Sheila Porter, you are
Noah Porter-Benson's

01:20.314 --> 01:23.317
maternal grandmother?
- I am, Your Honor.

01:23.351 --> 01:25.753
- We've provided Ellie Porter's
birth certificate

01:25.786 --> 01:29.290
and the DNA evidence to prove
relationship with Noah.

01:29.323 --> 01:30.724
- The fact that
they're related is not grounds

01:30.758 --> 01:32.726
to vacate a legal adoption,
Your Honor.

01:32.760 --> 01:37.431
- We would argue it is since
my client was never notified--

01:37.465 --> 01:40.268
- The State did conduct
a thorough and year-long search

01:40.301 --> 01:41.535
for any relatives.

01:41.569 --> 01:44.338
- And Ellie told me
that she was dead.

01:44.372 --> 01:47.275
- The loss of my daughter
is a regret that I will carry

01:47.308 --> 01:48.509
for the rest of my life.

01:48.542 --> 01:50.678
I spent years searching
for her.

01:50.711 --> 01:52.746
I hired private investigators.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.648
I was too late,

01:54.682 --> 01:57.418
but thank God I found Noah.

01:57.451 --> 02:01.222
I wanna make amends,
to be there for him in a way

02:01.255 --> 02:02.590
that I wasn't for Ellie.

02:02.623 --> 02:06.227
- He's a child, my child,

02:06.260 --> 02:09.730
not a way for you
to alleviate your guilt.

02:09.763 --> 02:11.332
- Lieutenant Benson, please.

02:11.365 --> 02:13.367
- I don't know what
her intentions are.

02:13.401 --> 02:16.270
She's a stranger to me,
to Noah.

02:16.304 --> 02:18.372
- I granted this hearing
because my concern

02:18.406 --> 02:20.374
is what's best for Noah.

02:20.408 --> 02:23.511
I would like to hear what
his grandmother has to say.

02:23.544 --> 02:24.845
Mrs. Porter?

02:24.878 --> 02:27.315
- I have no intention
of ripping a little boy

02:27.348 --> 02:29.717
from the only home
he has ever known,

02:29.750 --> 02:32.553
but I have serious reservations
about Ms. Benson's

02:32.586 --> 02:34.888
fitness to parent.

02:34.922 --> 02:36.424
- How so?

02:36.457 --> 02:38.559
- My PI became aware
of Noah's existence

02:38.592 --> 02:41.829
from an ACS investigation
for suspected child abuse.

02:41.862 --> 02:43.664
both: That investigation
is closed.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.599
- Your Honor, and it has
absolutely no bearing

02:45.633 --> 02:47.235
on the validity
of the adoption.

02:47.268 --> 02:48.669
- There was no findings
of wrongdoing.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.671
- I understand
that there were bruises.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.973
- There were bruises
on Noah because I saved him

02:53.006 --> 02:55.643
from almost being hit by a cab.

02:55.676 --> 02:56.944
I love my son.

02:56.977 --> 02:58.946
I would never, ever,

02:58.979 --> 03:01.282
do anything to hurt that boy.

03:01.315 --> 03:04.418
*

03:04.452 --> 03:05.886
I want what's best for him.

03:05.919 --> 03:08.489
I always have.

03:08.522 --> 03:11.325
- If you really cared
about what's best for him,

03:11.359 --> 03:13.227
you wouldn't deny him
a relationship

03:13.261 --> 03:14.562
with his grandmother,

03:14.595 --> 03:17.431
his only living blood relative.

03:17.465 --> 03:20.401
I may not be able to overturn
the adoption, Your Honor,

03:20.434 --> 03:22.670
but I am determined
to be a part

03:22.703 --> 03:26.740
of this little boy's life,
for his sake.

03:26.774 --> 03:29.943
*

03:29.977 --> 03:32.580
- [panting]

03:32.613 --> 03:33.581
[grunts]

03:33.614 --> 03:35.383
- Hey!

03:35.416 --> 03:37.318
- Officer, Officer,
you have to help me.

03:37.351 --> 03:38.586
Please, he's after--
- Are you okay?

03:38.619 --> 03:40.020
- He's after me.
- What's the matter?

03:40.053 --> 03:41.489
Calm down.
- He's after me, please.

03:41.522 --> 03:42.890
- Who's after you?
- He's after me.

03:42.923 --> 03:44.725
Help.
- This is Officer Kim

03:44.758 --> 03:46.294
requesting backup
in the northeast corner

03:46.327 --> 03:47.461
of the park.

03:47.495 --> 03:49.263
- 10-4, backup on their way.

03:49.297 --> 03:50.864
- Victim was found running
through Central Park

03:50.898 --> 03:51.899
about an hour ago.

03:51.932 --> 03:53.934
No ID, no possessions.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.603
My guess is she's 15 to 20.

03:55.636 --> 03:57.305
- What, she doesn't know
how old she is?

03:57.338 --> 03:58.806
- Or her name
or where she lives

03:58.839 --> 04:00.341
or how she got here.

04:00.374 --> 04:01.642
I don't know
what we're looking at here.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.444
- What, she didn't
tell you anything?

04:03.477 --> 04:05.279
- She told me that she was
forced to have sex,

04:05.313 --> 04:07.781
and there are definite
signs of abuse.

04:07.815 --> 04:10.351
Burn marks from cigarettes,

04:10.384 --> 04:13.321
maybe drain cleaner,

04:13.354 --> 04:15.889
but anything internal,
or if she's on drugs,

04:15.923 --> 04:17.658
I can't verify.
- Why not?

04:17.691 --> 04:19.627
- She won't let anyone
touch her.

04:19.660 --> 04:22.363
I'm waiting for a psych eval,
but they're backed up.

04:22.396 --> 04:23.764
In the meantime,
I thought someone should go in

04:23.797 --> 04:25.032
and try to get through
to her.

04:25.065 --> 04:28.402
- Okay, thank you, Doctor.

04:28.436 --> 04:32.506
Um, hi, hi there.

04:32.540 --> 04:34.775
I'm Amanda, and this is Sonny.

04:34.808 --> 04:35.909
We're police detectives.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.044
- Don't touch me.
- No, no.

04:37.077 --> 04:38.045
- Nobody's gonna touch you.

04:38.078 --> 04:39.046
- We wanna talk to you.

04:39.079 --> 04:40.948
- No.

04:40.981 --> 04:42.049
- It's okay.

04:42.082 --> 04:43.917
- I said don't touch me!

04:43.951 --> 04:51.325
*

04:54.428 --> 04:57.398
[dramatic music]

04:57.431 --> 05:04.638
*

05:41.742 --> 05:44.645
- Sorry, Fin, Noah is home sick
from school today.

05:44.678 --> 05:45.979
- It's all good, Liv.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.615
- Okay, so tell me
about this teenager.

05:47.648 --> 05:48.816
Is she a runaway?

05:48.849 --> 05:50.551
- It's more complicated
than that.

05:50.584 --> 05:52.052
She said she doesn't know
who she is or where she's from.

05:52.085 --> 05:53.654
- Is she in the system?

05:53.687 --> 05:55.088
- We don't know--
she refused medical treatment.

05:55.122 --> 05:57.157
DNA swab, rape kit--
- Hold on.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.926
And Bellevue released her?

05:58.959 --> 06:02.530
- On duty shrink said she's
no danger to herself or others.

06:08.602 --> 06:10.671
- I really don't remember
a lot.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.006
- It's okay.
Let's work backwards.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.542
How'd you get to Central Park?

06:14.575 --> 06:16.410
- Okay, what did the uni
in the park say?

06:16.444 --> 06:18.446
- She was on the run,
hysterical.

06:18.479 --> 06:20.448
Claims a man was chasing her.

06:20.481 --> 06:22.149
- We drove.
- Okay, good.

06:22.182 --> 06:24.518
And do you remember
what kind of car?

06:24.552 --> 06:27.588
- A van.
It was white.

06:27.621 --> 06:30.023
- White van, check.
I'll notify TARU.

06:30.057 --> 06:33.794
- Okay, can you tell us
who was driving?

06:33.827 --> 06:35.162
- Steve.

06:35.195 --> 06:37.097
- Okay, who is Steve?

06:37.130 --> 06:39.166
- The man I was
running away from.

06:39.199 --> 06:42.002
The man who made me
live with him.

06:42.035 --> 06:44.171
- How long did you live
with Steve?

06:44.204 --> 06:46.774
- As long as I can remember.

06:46.807 --> 06:48.041
- And Steve's not your father?

06:48.075 --> 06:51.111
- No, no.

06:51.144 --> 06:54.715
I have a real dad, I...

06:54.748 --> 07:00.621
Steve--Steve made me
have sex with him.

07:04.892 --> 07:07.861
- Can you tell us anything
about your real dad?

07:07.895 --> 07:09.730
- He was nice.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.031
He called me "Little M."

07:11.064 --> 07:14.735
- So Steve took you
from your family?

07:14.768 --> 07:16.136
- It was a long time ago.

07:16.169 --> 07:20.073
- Do you remember
how old you were?

07:20.107 --> 07:22.209
Were you going to school?

07:22.242 --> 07:24.144
- I was--I was a good girl.

07:24.177 --> 07:27.247
I didn't cry.
I didn't cry.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.116
- Was this your first day
of school?

07:29.149 --> 07:32.686
*

07:32.720 --> 07:33.987
Kindergarten?

07:34.021 --> 07:36.790
*

07:36.824 --> 07:39.627
- Yeah, I had a new dress.

07:39.660 --> 07:42.062
- Do you remember
anything else?

07:42.095 --> 07:45.198
- No, no, I said
I didn't remember.

07:45.232 --> 07:46.900
- It's okay, it's okay.

07:46.934 --> 07:50.137
Listen, do you remember
how you got to school?

07:50.170 --> 07:52.005
Did you walk?
Did you take the bus?

07:52.039 --> 07:54.041
- Yeah, I--yeah, I think so.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.176
It's a--it's like a train,
right?

07:56.209 --> 07:58.045
Underground?
- Yeah, yeah, that's right.

07:58.078 --> 08:00.714
That's right,
you took the subway.

08:00.748 --> 08:02.650
So you were in New York.

08:02.683 --> 08:04.017
- I guess so.

08:04.051 --> 08:05.786
I--yeah.
- Do you remember what you did

08:05.819 --> 08:10.090
after school?
Like where you went?

08:10.123 --> 08:12.793
Maybe the park?

08:12.826 --> 08:19.933
- Yeah, my big brother and I--
we were--we were playing

08:19.967 --> 08:23.804
hide and seek by the arch.

08:23.837 --> 08:29.843
*

08:29.877 --> 08:31.812
That's where Steve took me.

08:31.845 --> 08:38.218
*

08:38.251 --> 08:40.120
- We think this girl
is Emma Lawrence?

08:40.153 --> 08:42.055
- Well, Emma disappeared
in 2007.

08:42.089 --> 08:43.123
It was her first day
of kindergarten.

08:43.156 --> 08:44.658
She was six years old.

08:44.692 --> 08:46.727
Now, the age seems right.
She'd be 16 now.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.629
- And according
to the police reports,

08:48.662 --> 08:50.297
she was playing with her older
brother in Prospect Park

08:50.330 --> 08:53.233
by the arch, and this girl
remembers being called

08:53.266 --> 08:55.235
"Little M,"
the arch, the big brother.

08:55.268 --> 08:56.570
- No, I get it.

08:56.604 --> 08:58.606
There's a ton of details here.

08:58.639 --> 09:02.275
I just--I just wish
we has something concrete.

09:02.309 --> 09:04.978
- Now, I got the original file
from Brooklyn Missing Persons.

09:05.012 --> 09:07.247
They didn't find any DNA.
They didn't find any prints,

09:07.280 --> 09:09.617
but they did find her underwear
near the scene.

09:09.650 --> 09:12.085
Now, we could rerun that
and check it for touch DNA.

09:12.119 --> 09:13.721
- Yeah, let's start there.

09:13.754 --> 09:16.156
- I got the age progression
sketch.

09:16.189 --> 09:19.693
Emma Lawrence, age six to 16.

09:22.362 --> 09:23.997
- Lieutenant, that's her.

09:24.031 --> 09:26.800
*

09:26.834 --> 09:28.636
- Where are the parents?

09:28.669 --> 09:30.103
- Bill and Karen Lawrence moved
from Brooklyn to Queens

09:30.137 --> 09:33.907
with their son Glenn
eight years ago.

09:33.941 --> 09:39.312
- Well, unless we can find
a reason to exclude

09:39.346 --> 09:43.617
that this girl
is Emma Lawrence,

09:43.651 --> 09:46.353
family deserves to know.

09:46.386 --> 09:51.191
*

09:51.224 --> 09:54.928
- Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence,
please, take your time.

09:54.962 --> 09:57.998
- I don't need any more time.
It's Emma.

09:58.031 --> 10:00.033
I know my own daughter.

10:00.067 --> 10:03.837
Her hair, her eyes,
they're the exact same shade,

10:03.871 --> 10:06.774
more green than blue,
and her mouth, the freckles.

10:06.807 --> 10:09.877
- Oh, my God.
It's her.

10:09.910 --> 10:11.311
Is she all right?
Where is she?

10:11.344 --> 10:12.780
- She's at the precinct.
She's safe.

10:12.813 --> 10:14.648
- When can we see her?
- Soon.

10:14.682 --> 10:17.017
- How did you find her?
- She was in Central Park.

10:17.050 --> 10:19.419
She said that she had escaped
her kidnapper.

10:19.452 --> 10:23.691
- Oh, after all these years.

10:23.724 --> 10:26.794
Your sister's alive.
- I can't believe it.

10:26.827 --> 10:30.063
- I prayed every single night.
I never gave up hope.

10:30.097 --> 10:33.000
We moved, and we kept the same
phone number just in case.

10:33.033 --> 10:34.334
- That's really her?

10:34.367 --> 10:36.937
- Yes, I swear it is, son.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.972
Glenn was the last one
to see Emma.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.674
He was just a kid himself.

10:40.708 --> 10:42.042
- What you've
all been through...

10:42.075 --> 10:44.678
I--I can't imagine.

10:44.712 --> 10:48.248
- I look at you,
and I see an angel.

10:48.281 --> 10:52.686
The angel that found
our baby girl.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.154
- The Lawrences
are gonna follow us down

10:54.187 --> 10:57.457
to the precinct to meet Emma,
and Liv's gonna bring in

10:57.490 --> 10:59.359
a reunification specialist.

10:59.392 --> 11:01.962
- That look on their faces--
wow.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.764
- Yeah, you really followed
the Emma Lawrence case.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.398
- How could you not?
It was all over the news.

11:05.432 --> 11:07.134
It was nationwide.
- Yeah, but I just remember

11:07.167 --> 11:09.302
she went missing in
a Cleveland Cavaliers jersey.

11:09.336 --> 11:12.906
I mean, a six year old girl
from Brooklyn was a Cavs fan?

11:12.940 --> 11:15.308
- Actually, Bill Lawrence
grew up in Cleveland.

11:15.342 --> 11:17.044
I watched a ton of TV
that September.

11:17.077 --> 11:18.712
My Pops had a heart attack.

11:18.746 --> 11:20.881
I spent a lot of time
in the ICU waiting room.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.985
[knocking]

11:25.018 --> 11:30.390
- Emma, so this is Karen

11:30.423 --> 11:35.128
and Bill and Glenn Lawrence.

11:35.162 --> 11:36.797
- I don't know these people.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.231
I don't know them.
- Okay.

11:38.265 --> 11:39.867
That's okay.
That's okay.

11:39.900 --> 11:42.402
We're just gonna take our time.

11:42.435 --> 11:44.104
You remember
what we talked about?

11:44.137 --> 11:47.140
Sometimes these things don't
go as we expect them to,

11:47.174 --> 11:50.811
so we're just--we're just gonna
go real slow, okay?

11:53.413 --> 11:55.015
- It's me, Emma.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.716
It's Mommy.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.053
You don't recognize me?

12:00.087 --> 12:02.856
- And I'm your dad.

12:02.890 --> 12:05.425
I know this is a lot.
We're gonna give you

12:05.458 --> 12:08.028
all the time you need.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.430
- I'm sorry.
I don't recognize them.

12:10.463 --> 12:12.165
I...
- That's okay, Emma.

12:12.199 --> 12:13.834
It's all right.

12:13.867 --> 12:17.437
- Maybe this will help.
We brought something.

12:17.470 --> 12:20.373
A picture.
Is it okay to show her?

12:20.407 --> 12:22.943
- Emma is that all right
with you?

12:22.976 --> 12:24.377
- Yeah.

12:36.156 --> 12:37.825
Is that me?

12:37.858 --> 12:41.761
- Yes, it's you, honey.

12:43.330 --> 12:46.299
- And that's my big brother?
- Mm-hmm.

12:46.333 --> 12:47.801
- You?

12:47.835 --> 12:50.904
- Yeah, it's me, Glenn.

12:53.941 --> 12:56.810
- You got that doll
for Christmas that year.

12:56.844 --> 13:00.180
Do you remember that?

13:00.213 --> 13:07.187
*

13:07.220 --> 13:10.090
- I do.

13:10.123 --> 13:14.094
- You got the doll,
and Glenn got a bike.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.363
You were both so happy
in that picture.

13:16.396 --> 13:19.099
*

13:19.132 --> 13:22.235
- Yeah, I remember.

13:22.269 --> 13:24.304
Mom and Dad.

13:24.337 --> 13:26.406
- Yes, it's us.

13:26.439 --> 13:29.843
*

13:29.877 --> 13:31.979
- See, she knows us.

13:32.012 --> 13:35.215
You recognize us now,
don't you, sweetheart?

13:35.248 --> 13:37.384
- Yeah, Mom.

13:37.417 --> 13:39.586
*

13:39.619 --> 13:44.091
Dad and--and Glenn.

13:44.124 --> 13:49.329
*

13:49.362 --> 13:52.933
- We're here to take you home.

13:52.966 --> 13:53.600
- [laughs]

13:53.633 --> 13:57.204
I get--I get to go home.

13:57.237 --> 14:02.375
*

14:02.409 --> 14:05.112
- Oh, I'm sorry I didn't get
to say good night,

14:05.145 --> 14:07.447
but I'm glad
that he fell asleep.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.016
Thanks, Lucy.

14:09.049 --> 14:11.985
Okay, I'll be home in about 20.
Night.

14:12.019 --> 14:13.653
- TARU got back to me
with the street cam footage

14:13.686 --> 14:15.055
from Central Park.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.256
- Okay, any sign
of the kidnapper?

14:16.289 --> 14:18.325
- Not exactly.

14:18.358 --> 14:19.426
*

14:19.459 --> 14:22.495
- She took the subway.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.164
So no white van.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.598
- No.

14:25.632 --> 14:29.036
They backtracked the footage
from the two line.

14:29.069 --> 14:31.404
She got on the train
at 149th Street,

14:31.438 --> 14:33.440
Grand Concourse in the Bronx.

14:33.473 --> 14:35.642
*

14:35.675 --> 14:38.111
- Okay, there are a lot
of reasons that a girl

14:38.145 --> 14:42.349
in this situation might
leave out parts of the story.

14:42.382 --> 14:46.653
- I'm not saying we made
a mistake.

14:46.686 --> 14:49.056
- I hope you're right.

14:49.089 --> 14:51.925
*

14:54.094 --> 14:54.261
.

14:54.294 --> 14:55.062
- Emma Lawrence may not be
Emma Lawrence.

14:56.964 --> 14:58.365
- Talk to me.
- The surveillance footage

14:58.398 --> 15:00.968
that we found in the park
doesn't match her story.

15:01.001 --> 15:02.435
- But the family swears
it's her.

15:02.469 --> 15:05.238
- Yes, they do,
and the age progression photo

15:05.272 --> 15:08.141
is convincing,
but you know as well as I do

15:08.175 --> 15:10.143
age progression isn't
the gold standard.

15:10.177 --> 15:11.678
- You assumed this girl
was telling you the truth.

15:11.711 --> 15:14.147
Why wouldn't you?
- And she still might be.

15:14.181 --> 15:16.683
Either way,
something happened to her.

15:16.716 --> 15:19.419
There's definitely
signs of abuse.

15:19.452 --> 15:23.991
I just--I just don't know
what to think.

15:29.129 --> 15:31.564
About anything.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.433
- You okay?

15:33.466 --> 15:40.473
*

15:43.510 --> 15:48.581
- Ellie Porter's mother showed
up at my doorstep.

15:48.615 --> 15:54.054
It turns out that Noah
has a grandmother.

15:54.087 --> 15:56.623
- I'm sorry?

15:56.656 --> 16:00.994
- Yeah, her first move was
to try to vacate the adoption.

16:01.028 --> 16:04.097
I spent the entire morning
yesterday in family court.

16:04.131 --> 16:07.267
- Okay, I can tell you
that you cannot vacate

16:07.300 --> 16:09.069
an adoption,
not after three years.

16:09.102 --> 16:11.538
- I know, the law is
on my side, but the judge

16:11.571 --> 16:14.041
let her file for visitation.

16:14.074 --> 16:16.243
- Oh, how do you feel
about that?

16:16.276 --> 16:18.045
- My first instinct is no.

16:18.078 --> 16:20.613
- Right, you wanna
protect Noah.

16:20.647 --> 16:24.417
- That is my instinct, right?

16:24.451 --> 16:28.355
Am I preventing this little boy
from having a relationship

16:28.388 --> 16:34.394
with the only living
blood relative that he has?

16:34.427 --> 16:37.497
With his only connection
to Ellie?

16:37.530 --> 16:40.767
*

16:40.800 --> 16:43.103
You know, I used to be so sure

16:43.136 --> 16:49.109
that I knew
what was best for Noah,

16:49.142 --> 16:53.413
but now,
as he gets older,

16:53.446 --> 16:56.749
I'm just doubting myself
at every turn.

16:56.783 --> 17:00.053
*

17:00.087 --> 17:01.754
- Well, from what I've heard
about raising kids,

17:01.788 --> 17:05.092
it never gets any easier.

17:05.125 --> 17:08.528
You can trust your instincts.

17:08.561 --> 17:10.130
You can.

17:10.163 --> 17:13.133
*

17:13.166 --> 17:15.068
[cheers and applause]

17:15.102 --> 17:18.138
- Isaiah, Isaiah!

17:18.171 --> 17:20.240
[cheers and applause]

17:20.273 --> 17:22.275
- Thanks very much.
Thank you.

17:22.309 --> 17:24.377
Words cannot express
how grateful we are

17:24.411 --> 17:26.146
to have Emma back home with us.

17:26.179 --> 17:28.315
- We are blessed
by the outpouring of support.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.583
We wanna start
by thanking the NYPD.

17:30.617 --> 17:32.319
- Yes.

17:32.352 --> 17:33.853
We'd also like to thank
Isaiah Thomas

17:33.886 --> 17:35.688
for being with us here today.

17:35.722 --> 17:38.658
[cheers and applause]

17:38.691 --> 17:41.728
- Like all of us,
I remember the picture of Emma

17:41.761 --> 17:43.463
in her Cavaliers jersey.

17:43.496 --> 17:46.266
I bring the strength
of this family on the court

17:46.299 --> 17:48.601
every game that I play.

17:48.635 --> 17:50.703
We play and pray for you.

17:50.737 --> 17:53.840
This jersey is to honor
your homecoming and remember

17:53.873 --> 17:56.109
to always believe.

17:56.143 --> 17:59.879
[cheers and applause]

17:59.912 --> 18:01.648
- Thank you.

18:01.681 --> 18:03.183
And thank you all.

18:03.216 --> 18:05.318
I'm just so grateful
to be home.

18:05.352 --> 18:07.520
Thank you.
- Thanks, Emma.

18:07.554 --> 18:09.156
Thanks, man.
- They didn't waste any time

18:09.189 --> 18:11.324
getting the word out.
- Yeah.

18:11.358 --> 18:15.462
[overlapping voices]

18:15.495 --> 18:18.165
[knocking]

18:18.198 --> 18:20.167
- Detectives.
- Is everything all right?

18:20.200 --> 18:21.868
- We need to talk
to both of you.

18:21.901 --> 18:23.370
- Please.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.376
- I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

18:29.409 --> 18:31.878
She is Emma.
My little girl.

18:31.911 --> 18:34.214
- All we're asking for
is a DNA sample

18:34.247 --> 18:36.483
from her or from you two.
- But not now.

18:36.516 --> 18:38.885
Emma is just getting
comfortable with us.

18:38.918 --> 18:40.487
I can't retraumatize her.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.322
Not to mention what
this is doing to my wife.

18:42.355 --> 18:43.823
You're coming in here,
upsetting her.

18:43.856 --> 18:45.492
Hasn't she been through enough?

18:45.525 --> 18:48.395
- Forget about the DNA.
We don't need it right now.

18:48.428 --> 18:51.231
But Mrs. Lawrence, we really
need to speak to Emma.

18:51.264 --> 18:52.632
The guy that did this is
still out there.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.167
He could be a threat to her.

18:54.201 --> 18:56.336
He could be a threat
to your whole family.

18:56.369 --> 18:59.406
- You're right.

18:59.439 --> 19:02.375
Bill, don't we want
whoever did this in prison?

19:02.409 --> 19:04.644
I think we should let them
talk to her.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.482
- But with us in the room.

19:10.883 --> 19:12.452
- It was a white van.

19:12.485 --> 19:13.953
Maybe I just got confused
when I jumped out.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.655
- That's okay.

19:15.688 --> 19:17.690
Tell us more about how
you jumped out of the van.

19:17.724 --> 19:19.659
- It was--
- You don't have to answer

19:19.692 --> 19:21.928
any more questions
if you don't want to .

19:21.961 --> 19:24.564
- No, it's okay.
I want to.

19:24.597 --> 19:27.967
We were stopped
at a traffic light,

19:28.000 --> 19:30.203
and it wasn't anywhere
I recognized.

19:30.237 --> 19:33.306
- Okay, so you jumped out.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.342
You had no ID, no money.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.244
- Steve never let me
have those things.

19:37.277 --> 19:38.711
- Okay, can you tell us
how you were able

19:38.745 --> 19:41.748
to take the subway then?

19:41.781 --> 19:43.416
- What's this about?

19:43.450 --> 19:46.319
- Well, we have footage
of Emma entering the subway

19:46.353 --> 19:49.489
in the Bronx and coming out
in Central Park,

19:49.522 --> 19:52.459
so we're just wondering
how you got there.

19:52.492 --> 19:53.860
- I asked someone for help.

19:53.893 --> 19:55.295
- I don't know
why this matters.

19:55.328 --> 19:56.763
- Do I have to talk about this?

19:56.796 --> 19:58.331
- Emma, we're just trying
to learn everything

19:58.365 --> 20:00.733
that we can about
how you escaped,

20:00.767 --> 20:01.834
about the man who took you.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.303
- Okay, you rode in a van.

20:03.336 --> 20:05.838
How long was the ride?

20:05.872 --> 20:07.974
- I don't know.

20:08.007 --> 20:09.309
A few hours, maybe.

20:09.342 --> 20:10.510
- A few hours, okay.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.412
So maybe you were out of state?

20:12.445 --> 20:14.247
- Must've been, yeah.

20:14.281 --> 20:15.448
- Do you remember
anything about where

20:15.482 --> 20:17.016
you were being held?

20:17.049 --> 20:19.786
- It wasn't the city.

20:19.819 --> 20:22.955
- Right.

20:22.989 --> 20:25.792
- It was a farm, yeah.

20:25.825 --> 20:27.026
Pennsylvania, maybe.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.729
- Pennsylvania, okay.

20:29.762 --> 20:31.831
What kind of farm was it?

20:31.864 --> 20:35.602
- Um, oranges maybe?

20:35.635 --> 20:38.805
I wasn't allowed
to go outside very much.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.440
I was locked in a room.

20:40.473 --> 20:44.544
I--I don't wanna think
about this anymore.

20:44.577 --> 20:45.878
- All right, you know what?

20:45.912 --> 20:47.614
I think we're done here, yeah.

20:47.647 --> 20:49.516
- I can't remember anymore.
- It's okay, sweetheart.

20:49.549 --> 20:50.950
- No, don't touch me!

20:50.983 --> 20:52.419
- Oh, I'm sorry, honey, Emma!

20:52.452 --> 20:54.354
- You know, I gotta ask you
to leave.

20:54.387 --> 20:56.623
We have to take care
of our daughter.

20:56.656 --> 20:59.659
*

20:59.692 --> 21:01.928
- We've alerted the
Pennsylvania State Troopers.

21:01.961 --> 21:04.764
So far, no sign of a white van
with Pennsylvania plates

21:04.797 --> 21:07.033
anywhere near
the Grand Concourse station

21:07.066 --> 21:08.901
or the 110th Street station.

21:08.935 --> 21:10.870
- Not to mention there are no
orange groves in Pennsylvania,

21:10.903 --> 21:12.905
so this girl is making
the story up as she goes along.

21:12.939 --> 21:15.675
- Or, if she is Emma,
she's been missing a long time.

21:15.708 --> 21:17.877
She could be confused and
have gaps in her memory.

21:17.910 --> 21:20.947
- Barba, can you get us
a warrant for her DNA?

21:20.980 --> 21:23.583
- I could, but I'd rather not.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.485
What if you're wrong and
this girl is Emma Lawrence?

21:25.518 --> 21:27.354
That's not a call
I wanna get from the DA.

21:27.387 --> 21:28.888
Not after the ledger declared
the case closed.

21:28.921 --> 21:31.858
You guys are gonna have
to unclose it yourselves.

21:31.891 --> 21:33.693
- I think I just did.

21:33.726 --> 21:36.463
I brought a photo of our girl
over to Real Time Crime.

21:36.496 --> 21:38.531
Turns out she's wanted
on a bench warrant

21:38.565 --> 21:40.600
for credit card fraud
in Inverness, Florida.

21:40.633 --> 21:44.704
- Name's Britney Taylor,
date of birth 7/20/96.

21:44.737 --> 21:46.873
That makes her 21.
- That could be an alias

21:46.906 --> 21:49.642
or a fake DOB or a girl
who looks similar.

21:49.676 --> 21:51.778
- No, I tracked down
the arresting officer.

21:51.811 --> 21:55.415
He described cigarette burns
and a chemical burn on her arm.

21:55.448 --> 21:57.717
That's her.

21:57.750 --> 22:04.591
*

22:06.859 --> 22:06.993
.

22:07.026 --> 22:07.927
- We're here
in the Lawrence home

22:10.029 --> 22:11.731
with an exclusive interview
with Emma Lawrence,

22:11.764 --> 22:13.500
her parents and brother,
the family

22:13.533 --> 22:14.967
that captured America's heart.

22:15.001 --> 22:17.970
Emma, your story
is so remarkable.

22:18.004 --> 22:20.807
I understand that once police
started questioning you,

22:20.840 --> 22:23.610
you actually remembered
the day you were taken.

22:23.643 --> 22:26.946
- Yes, I--I was playing

22:26.979 --> 22:31.117
in Prospect Park
with my brother,

22:31.150 --> 22:34.721
hide and seek,
and a man asked me

22:34.754 --> 22:37.156
if I wanted some candy.

22:37.189 --> 22:42.462
Before I even knew what he--
what was happening, I--

22:42.495 --> 22:45.398
he put a rag over my face.

22:45.432 --> 22:50.069
I must've passed out before
I could even scream.

22:50.102 --> 22:52.805
And the next thing I knew,
I was in the back of a van.

22:52.839 --> 22:57.777
- Glenn, what did you do when
you realized Emma was missing?

22:57.810 --> 23:02.882
- Well, I thought
she was hiding, um.

23:02.915 --> 23:05.418
Yeah, I--you know,
I called for her name.

23:05.452 --> 23:07.787
She didn't answer.
I kept looking,

23:07.820 --> 23:09.489
but I didn't see anything.

23:09.522 --> 23:13.560
I didn't hear anything,
and I went to my parents

23:13.593 --> 23:15.962
and told them what happened.

23:15.995 --> 23:18.998
- Something's going on here.
- That kid looks a little off.

23:19.031 --> 23:22.635
- No, no, it's more than that.
- What do you mean, Carisi?

23:22.669 --> 23:23.903
I read the DD-5
from the original

23:23.936 --> 23:25.037
missing persons file.

23:25.071 --> 23:26.773
Now, at the time, Glenn told

23:26.806 --> 23:28.608
the investigators
that he heard Emma scream.

23:28.641 --> 23:30.910
Then he found the underwear,
and then he ran home.

23:30.943 --> 23:33.145
- Now he claims
he didn't hear anything?

23:33.179 --> 23:35.181
*

23:35.214 --> 23:36.883
- Son of a bitch.

23:36.916 --> 23:39.652
He's tailoring his version
of events to match hers.

23:39.686 --> 23:42.989
- In the original files,
was Glenn listen as a suspect?

23:43.022 --> 23:48.060
- Not directly, but he was
interviewed a half dozen times.

23:48.094 --> 23:50.530
- Find out why.

23:50.563 --> 23:53.065
*

23:53.099 --> 23:55.668
- I'll switch to the bourbon.

23:55.702 --> 23:58.505
- Yeah, I'll have
what he's having.

23:58.538 --> 23:59.939
- My tab.
- Sure thing.

23:59.972 --> 24:01.908
- Thanks.

24:01.941 --> 24:04.811
I saw you on TV today.

24:04.844 --> 24:07.046
Wow, what you
must've been through.

24:07.079 --> 24:10.116
And it's probably not
my place to say it,

24:10.149 --> 24:13.986
but I always did feel for you,
you know?

24:14.020 --> 24:16.122
Last one to see
your sister alive.

24:16.155 --> 24:18.224
- Till now.
- Till now, right.

24:18.257 --> 24:23.996
Still, I mean, it must've
been really tough to move on.

24:24.030 --> 24:27.900
- You try.
No one lets you.

24:27.934 --> 24:29.502
- People know one thing,
they think

24:29.536 --> 24:31.571
they know everything.

24:31.604 --> 24:33.740
- Nobody knows anything.

24:33.773 --> 24:35.675
Not about me, anyway.

24:35.708 --> 24:37.143
- I'd like to.

24:37.176 --> 24:39.946
*

24:39.979 --> 24:42.715
- No, no, I can't trust anyone.

24:42.749 --> 24:44.250
- You can trust me.

24:44.283 --> 24:48.254
*

24:48.287 --> 24:51.958
- No.

24:51.991 --> 24:54.661
- What about Emma?
Do you trust her?

24:54.694 --> 24:58.998
*

24:59.031 --> 25:01.000
- Emma and me know what's up.

25:01.033 --> 25:04.303
- What does Emma know, Glenn?

25:04.336 --> 25:05.905
- She knows why.

25:05.938 --> 25:08.240
- Why what?

25:08.274 --> 25:12.879
*

25:12.912 --> 25:16.248
Where is she?

25:16.282 --> 25:20.720
Where is Emma, Glenn?

25:20.753 --> 25:23.222
- Deep, deep down.

25:23.255 --> 25:25.592
Deep, deep enough.

25:25.625 --> 25:27.594
- It's time to go, Glenn.

25:27.627 --> 25:28.661
- Nah, I'm with a friend.

25:28.695 --> 25:29.962
- Thanks for the call, Greg.

25:29.996 --> 25:31.197
She's not your friend, son.
Come on.

25:31.230 --> 25:34.767
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

25:34.801 --> 25:36.769
- You stay the hell away
from my family.

25:36.803 --> 25:38.771
*

25:38.805 --> 25:40.172
- What do you think?

25:40.206 --> 25:43.242
- We need to get that girl
out of there.

25:43.275 --> 25:45.177
Con artist or no.

25:45.211 --> 25:51.183
*

25:51.217 --> 25:53.252
- Get your hands off of her.

25:53.285 --> 25:54.821
- I will sue all of you.

25:54.854 --> 25:56.656
You cannot just take
our daughter away.

25:56.689 --> 25:58.324
- She's not your daughter.
- Where are you taking her?

25:58.357 --> 26:00.927
- To the precinct
till we sort this stuff out.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.328
- Mom, Dad, it's okay.
I'll explain.

26:02.361 --> 26:05.064
It's a misunderstanding.
- I'm calling our lawyer.

26:05.097 --> 26:06.799
- Mr. Lawrence, that is
your right, but right now,

26:06.833 --> 26:08.267
I'm taking her in.

26:08.300 --> 26:10.837
*

26:10.870 --> 26:12.338
I'm sorry.

26:12.371 --> 26:15.341
[dramatic music]

26:15.374 --> 26:22.615
*

26:24.817 --> 26:25.117
.

26:25.151 --> 26:25.918
- You can tell us
your real name now.

26:27.386 --> 26:29.155
- It's Emma Lawrence.
- Stop it.

26:29.188 --> 26:30.757
- Prints were a match
to an arrest warrant

26:30.790 --> 26:32.759
in Florida two years ago
for a Britney Taylor.

26:32.792 --> 26:34.093
- No, that's a fake name.

26:34.126 --> 26:35.361
Steve made me steal
credit cards

26:35.394 --> 26:37.296
and lie to the cops.
- Oh.

26:37.329 --> 26:40.633
- I'm sorry that I made up
the white van and the farm

26:40.667 --> 26:43.302
in Pennsylvania,
but I've been in Florida

26:43.335 --> 26:46.773
with Steve--
- Okay, shh, stop, just stop.

26:46.806 --> 26:49.842
Britney, or whatever
your name is,

26:49.876 --> 26:53.279
we got a DNA swab,
so we are going to find out

26:53.312 --> 26:54.881
that you're not Emma Lawrence.

26:54.914 --> 26:56.749
- And why do you have to
do that?

26:56.783 --> 26:59.285
Bill and Karen love me.
All of New York loves me.

26:59.318 --> 27:00.653
I'm the story of the year.

27:00.687 --> 27:02.254
That's good news for once.

27:02.288 --> 27:06.859
- Cigarette burns,
the chemical burn on your arm,

27:06.893 --> 27:08.294
who did that to you?

27:08.327 --> 27:10.963
- My real family, okay?

27:10.997 --> 27:12.364
My mom was a meth-head.

27:12.398 --> 27:15.201
She had fun putting cigarettes
out on me.

27:15.234 --> 27:20.206
Yeah, and one time,
I tried to fight her off,

27:20.239 --> 27:23.810
and she put drain cleaner
all over.

27:23.843 --> 27:29.348
*

27:29.381 --> 27:32.852
I learned my lesson.

27:32.885 --> 27:34.320
I'm never going back there.

27:34.353 --> 27:36.355
- Okay, we're not gonna
make you go anywhere

27:36.388 --> 27:38.090
you don't wanna go.

27:38.124 --> 27:41.060
- I can't go anywhere,
don't you get it?

27:41.093 --> 27:44.831
*

27:44.864 --> 27:47.333
I turned 21 this summer.

27:47.366 --> 27:50.002
When I was a teenager,
I'd stay at youth shelters,

27:50.036 --> 27:52.304
but I'm too old now.

27:52.338 --> 27:56.142
And the adult shelters,
they're just so...

27:56.175 --> 28:00.980
- So you decided to become
Emma Lawrence.

28:01.013 --> 28:03.082
Why, why this family?

28:03.115 --> 28:05.952
*

28:05.985 --> 28:08.120
- I saw a special on the news.

28:08.154 --> 28:10.356
*

28:10.389 --> 28:14.927
Bill and Karen sending
a message to Emma

28:14.961 --> 28:21.000
that they loved her
and they wanted her home.

28:21.033 --> 28:25.204
And I figured I looked a lot
like her when I was a kid.

28:25.237 --> 28:27.807
*

28:27.840 --> 28:32.278
So I read all about her,
and you were so nice.

28:32.311 --> 28:34.380
*

28:34.413 --> 28:38.017
I just wanted a family.

28:38.050 --> 28:39.351
What's wrong with that?

28:39.385 --> 28:42.288
- There's nothing
wrong with that,

28:42.321 --> 28:43.956
but they're not your family.

28:43.990 --> 28:46.325
- But they wanna be, badly.
I can tell.

28:46.358 --> 28:49.896
Bill and Karen.
- What about Glenn?

28:49.929 --> 28:53.065
- Well, he wants me
there most of all.

28:53.099 --> 28:55.134
He knows I'm not really Emma.

28:55.167 --> 28:56.969
- He told you that?
- Pretty much,

28:57.003 --> 28:59.772
and he said how happy
that I make his mom

28:59.806 --> 29:02.174
and that I can never
tell the truth

29:02.208 --> 29:04.343
and that I can never leave.

29:04.376 --> 29:08.380
- What else did he say
about Emma?

29:08.414 --> 29:11.283
- Just that she's never
coming back.

29:11.317 --> 29:15.287
*

29:15.321 --> 29:17.156
Did he do something to her?

29:17.189 --> 29:20.927
Because I had nothing
to do with that, I swear, okay?

29:20.960 --> 29:23.195
Are you guys
gonna arrest me now?

29:23.229 --> 29:26.332
- Not if you help us.

29:26.365 --> 29:32.438
*

29:32.471 --> 29:34.206
- Thanks for meeting me.

29:34.240 --> 29:35.842
I can't talk in front
of Bill and Karen.

29:35.875 --> 29:37.343
- Yeah, they think
I'm out to get cigarettes.

29:37.376 --> 29:38.978
They were up all night arguing.

29:39.011 --> 29:41.180
Mom was crying,
she almost jumped in the car

29:41.213 --> 29:42.548
and drove to the city.

29:42.581 --> 29:44.550
- What happened
with the police?

29:44.583 --> 29:47.419
- They didn't have enough
evidence to hold me.

29:47.453 --> 29:48.821
- What does that mean?

29:48.855 --> 29:50.289
Do they know that
you're not Emma?

29:50.322 --> 29:52.825
- They let me go, didn't they?

29:52.859 --> 29:55.227
But they're starting
to suspect something.

29:55.261 --> 29:57.396
- So what'd you tell them?

29:59.231 --> 30:01.033
- I don't know
if I should tell you.

30:01.067 --> 30:02.301
- What does that mean?

30:02.334 --> 30:03.569
- I don't know
who I can trust anymore.

30:03.602 --> 30:05.471
- You can trust me.
- Can I?

30:05.504 --> 30:09.041
- Yes, just keep quiet,
and everything

30:09.075 --> 30:10.877
is going to be fine, okay?

30:10.910 --> 30:13.112
- It sounds like
he's buying her story.

30:13.145 --> 30:15.247
- She's a good con artist.

30:15.281 --> 30:16.382
- She had to be.

30:16.415 --> 30:18.550
- It's not that simple.

30:21.553 --> 30:23.890
- What do you want from me,
huh?

30:23.923 --> 30:25.591
Money, is that
what this is about?

30:25.624 --> 30:29.896
- No, I just want the truth
so that I can protect myself.

30:32.164 --> 30:33.933
What happened to Emma?

30:33.966 --> 30:35.868
Did she run away?

30:35.902 --> 30:37.636
- No.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.405
No, she was six years old.

30:39.438 --> 30:42.008
- All right, did you see
who took her, is that it?

30:42.041 --> 30:45.411
Was it somebody you know?
- No, it was nothing like that.

30:45.444 --> 30:47.947
*

30:47.980 --> 30:51.150
- If we're gonna be partners,
then you need to come clean.

30:51.183 --> 30:54.120
*

30:54.153 --> 30:55.387
What's gonna happen to me?

30:55.421 --> 30:59.158
Like, what if Emma
just comes back?

30:59.191 --> 31:00.626
I could get arrested.

31:00.659 --> 31:02.161
- She's not coming back.
I already told you that.

31:02.194 --> 31:04.196
- How do I know that?

31:04.230 --> 31:09.468
*

31:09.501 --> 31:12.104
Did you do something
to her, Glenn?

31:12.138 --> 31:14.974
*

31:15.007 --> 31:17.409
- God, you do look
exactly like her.

31:17.443 --> 31:20.179
I mean, you even sound
like her.

31:20.212 --> 31:22.614
*

31:22.648 --> 31:25.517
- Did you hurt her?
Should I be worried?

31:25.551 --> 31:27.119
I--
- No, of course not.

31:27.153 --> 31:28.587
- Come on, come on, Britney,
you can do this.

31:28.620 --> 31:30.056
- He's gonna give it up.
He's been waiting

31:30.089 --> 31:31.590
for this moment for ten years.

31:31.623 --> 31:35.394
- Okay, you're scaring me,
and I--I can't do this right.

31:35.427 --> 31:38.464
- Stop, stop.

31:38.497 --> 31:45.271
*

31:45.304 --> 31:47.173
It wasn't anything like that.

31:47.206 --> 31:49.308
- Okay.

31:49.341 --> 31:50.943
- It was an accident.

31:50.977 --> 31:52.244
- Okay.

31:52.278 --> 31:56.315
It was an accident.

31:56.348 --> 31:59.551
Then she ended up dead?

31:59.585 --> 32:01.520
- I didn't mean it.

32:01.553 --> 32:04.123
*

32:04.156 --> 32:06.658
I didn't mean it.

32:06.692 --> 32:08.460
I didn't mean it.

32:08.494 --> 32:11.697
- Glenn, did you kill
your sister?

32:11.730 --> 32:15.234
- You've been carrying
this secret for a long time.

32:15.267 --> 32:17.103
It's time to let it go.

32:17.136 --> 32:19.338
*

32:19.371 --> 32:22.374
It'll be okay.

32:22.408 --> 32:24.310
- I didn't mean it.

32:24.343 --> 32:26.112
*

32:26.145 --> 32:27.980
- Tell us what happened.

32:28.014 --> 32:30.516
*

32:30.549 --> 32:35.487
- She knew not to dance
in front of the TV.

32:35.521 --> 32:37.990
I said to her, "Emma, move."

32:38.024 --> 32:39.458
She wouldn't.

32:39.491 --> 32:42.294
*

32:42.328 --> 32:45.397
She just kept twirling.

32:45.431 --> 32:47.166
I told her to move again.

32:47.199 --> 32:52.138
She didn't, and, um...

32:52.171 --> 32:55.507
So I grabbed a couch cushion.

32:55.541 --> 32:59.478
I was pressing down.

32:59.511 --> 33:02.781
She was struggling,
but I was just so mad,

33:02.814 --> 33:06.285
I--I kept pressing down,
and, um...

33:06.318 --> 33:12.624
*

33:12.658 --> 33:18.030
I just wanted her to stop.

33:18.064 --> 33:20.266
And she did.

33:20.299 --> 33:23.069
*

33:23.102 --> 33:27.173
- What did you do
with her body, Glenn?

33:27.206 --> 33:30.309
*

33:30.342 --> 33:31.677
You were just a boy.

33:31.710 --> 33:34.046
You couldn't have done that
by yourself.

33:34.080 --> 33:35.647
Who helped you?

33:43.722 --> 33:44.090
.

33:44.123 --> 33:44.590
- I don't understand.

33:45.824 --> 33:47.559
Where is Glenn?
Where is Emma?

33:47.593 --> 33:49.128
- You're gonna have to ask
your husband.

33:49.161 --> 33:51.630
- Bill?
- Just stop talking, Karen.

33:51.663 --> 33:53.399
- We have a warrant
for your husband's arrest.

33:53.432 --> 33:54.700
- For what?
Bill?

33:54.733 --> 33:56.535
- I can explain.
I will explain.

33:56.568 --> 33:58.504
- What the hell is going on?

33:58.537 --> 34:00.372
Where is my daughter?
Where is my son?

34:00.406 --> 34:01.807
What are you doing
to my family?

34:01.840 --> 34:05.043
- Mrs. Lawrence, if you have
a lawyer, call them now.

34:08.447 --> 34:11.150
[dramatic music]

34:11.183 --> 34:13.152
- Your Honor, in exchange
for William Lawrence's

34:13.185 --> 34:15.187
guilty plea of falsely
reporting an incident

34:15.221 --> 34:18.124
in the third and obstructing
governmental administration

34:18.157 --> 34:19.858
in the second,
the people agree to reduce

34:19.891 --> 34:22.728
Glenn Lawrence's second degree
manslaughter charge

34:22.761 --> 34:24.430
to criminally negligent
homicide.

34:24.463 --> 34:27.333
As part of the plea,
Mr. Lawrence will allocute.

34:32.838 --> 34:36.275
- My daughter used to ask me
who I loved more--

34:36.308 --> 34:39.178
her or her brother.

34:39.211 --> 34:42.181
I would tell her
"How can you choose

34:42.214 --> 34:47.486
which of your own two feet
you like best?"

34:47.519 --> 34:49.788
I loved my Emma.

34:49.821 --> 34:54.460
When I lost her,
I lost a part of myself.

34:54.493 --> 34:55.894
[radio transmissions]

34:55.927 --> 35:01.333
I would've rather lost
all of myself

35:01.367 --> 35:04.403
than to discover
her lifeless body.

35:04.436 --> 35:06.572
*

35:06.605 --> 35:09.875
I--I breathed into her mouth.

35:09.908 --> 35:12.211
I pressed down on her chest.

35:12.244 --> 35:14.213
*

35:14.246 --> 35:20.252
I felt her wrist for a pulse,
but there was nothing.

35:20.286 --> 35:23.455
There was nothing I could do.

35:23.489 --> 35:28.760
And then I saw

35:28.794 --> 35:33.932
my son's life disappear
before my eyes,

35:33.965 --> 35:36.668
before his own eyes.

35:36.702 --> 35:40.606
You know, that look,
the guilt.

35:40.639 --> 35:43.309
*

35:43.342 --> 35:47.613
No one should have to go
through what he went through.

35:47.646 --> 35:51.817
No father should ever have to
see their son like that.

35:51.850 --> 35:54.320
He loved his sister.

35:54.353 --> 35:56.688
*

35:56.722 --> 35:58.824
I did what any father
would do.

35:58.857 --> 36:02.461
I couldn't lose him too.

36:02.494 --> 36:05.697
I wish to God every day
it did not happen,

36:05.731 --> 36:08.834
but it did.

36:08.867 --> 36:11.537
I don't regret helping my son,
not for one second.

36:11.570 --> 36:16.675
I--I did not think twice then,

36:16.708 --> 36:20.279
nor have I ever regretted
that decision.

36:20.312 --> 36:23.282
I accepted the plea
to avoid putting my wife

36:23.315 --> 36:26.618
through a painful trial,
and Karen...

36:26.652 --> 36:29.388
*

36:29.421 --> 36:32.691
I miss Emma.

36:32.724 --> 36:36.428
And I forgive Glenn.

36:36.462 --> 36:38.797
I just hope you can
forgive him too

36:38.830 --> 36:41.433
and you can forgive me.

36:41.467 --> 36:48.507
*

36:52.411 --> 36:59.518
- Mrs. Lawrence, I'm so sorry
for what you've been through.

36:59.551 --> 37:01.620
*

37:01.653 --> 37:06.525
- I wish you'd never found her.

37:06.558 --> 37:09.861
Before, I at least--I had hope.

37:09.895 --> 37:13.599
Hope that my little girl
was still alive.

37:13.632 --> 37:16.802
And now I have nothing.

37:16.835 --> 37:24.242
*

37:36.755 --> 37:38.290
- Hey.

37:41.827 --> 37:45.864
Thank you for meeting me.

37:45.897 --> 37:47.032
Do you want something?

37:47.065 --> 37:49.601
- No, I'm okay, thank you.

37:51.737 --> 37:54.005
I don't wanna be your enemy.

37:54.039 --> 38:00.812
- No, you are--you are
my son's grandmother.

38:01.980 --> 38:03.515
I don't think
that we should be

38:03.549 --> 38:06.918
dealing with each other
in a court room.

38:06.952 --> 38:09.020
- I realize that
my showing up at your door,

38:09.054 --> 38:11.523
that could not have been
easy for you.

38:11.557 --> 38:14.593
The last thing I wanna do
is cause stress for you

38:14.626 --> 38:16.762
or for Noah.

38:16.795 --> 38:19.898
- I appreciate that.

38:19.931 --> 38:23.034
- I didn't know how else
to get your attention.

38:25.437 --> 38:28.940
You know, I--
I used to think

38:28.974 --> 38:31.710
that Ellie never
listened to me,

38:31.743 --> 38:33.612
but it was me.

38:33.645 --> 38:37.082
I wasn't saying anything
she wanted to hear.

38:37.115 --> 38:40.752
I didn't see her.

38:40.786 --> 38:43.088
What she wanted.

38:46.958 --> 38:50.762
- May I ask you...

38:50.796 --> 38:53.965
What happened?

38:53.999 --> 38:58.103
- Normal teenager acting out.

38:58.136 --> 39:00.706
She had a boyfriend,
a little older.

39:00.739 --> 39:02.641
My husband hated him.

39:02.674 --> 39:06.578
No one was good enough
for his little girl.

39:06.612 --> 39:08.447
She started using drugs.

39:08.480 --> 39:11.850
The angrier my husband got,
the more Ellie withdrew.

39:11.883 --> 39:14.686
He called the police
on her once.

39:14.720 --> 39:17.589
My husband said
we had to let her go.

39:17.623 --> 39:19.090
Tough love.

39:19.124 --> 39:23.028
He was convinced it was
the right thing to do.

39:23.061 --> 39:25.597
I believed him.

39:25.631 --> 39:29.034
He died a year
after Ellie left home.

39:33.505 --> 39:37.509
I lost my husband
and my daughter.

39:39.945 --> 39:43.515
I don't want to lose
my grandchild.

39:48.554 --> 39:52.057
- I want what's best
for my son.

39:54.860 --> 39:58.129
- So what do we do now?

40:03.935 --> 40:06.905
- Are you ready, Noah?
- Yes.

40:06.938 --> 40:10.075
- Okay, so, honey,
listen to me.

40:10.108 --> 40:14.145
Like we talked about,
if you feel uncomfortable,

40:14.179 --> 40:16.982
or you don't wanna do this,
you tell me, okay?

40:17.015 --> 40:19.485
- Okay.
- You whisper it in my ear

40:19.518 --> 40:21.487
like we do, okay?
- Okay.

40:21.520 --> 40:22.954
- Okay.

[knocking]

40:31.797 --> 40:33.532

40:38.804 --> 40:40.872
- I hope I'm not too early.

40:40.906 --> 40:43.208
- No, you're right on time.

40:43.241 --> 40:45.443
Come on in.
- Thank you.

40:48.980 --> 40:50.682
Your home is lovely.

40:50.716 --> 40:52.784
- Oh, thank you.

40:55.186 --> 40:57.188
- This must be Noah.

40:59.090 --> 41:01.092
He's perfect.

41:01.126 --> 41:05.096
- So Noah, this is Sheila.

41:05.130 --> 41:08.634
Honey, can you say hello?
- Hello.

41:08.667 --> 41:11.970
- Hello, Noah.

41:12.003 --> 41:15.240
It is so very nice
to finally meet you.

41:16.875 --> 41:18.977
I'm your grandmother.

41:19.010 --> 41:20.912
- Hi, Grandma.

41:20.946 --> 41:22.881
- Hi.

41:22.914 --> 41:27.252
You and I--we're gonna
get to know each other.

41:27.285 --> 41:28.920
Would that that be okay?

41:28.954 --> 41:30.722
- Okay.

41:30.756 --> 41:32.257
- I'm glad.

41:32.290 --> 41:34.626
And I brought some books.

41:34.660 --> 41:37.095
I thought maybe
I could read to you.

41:37.128 --> 41:39.865
*

41:39.898 --> 41:42.868
- Sure.
- Sure.

41:42.901 --> 41:45.036
Do you want to see my room?

41:45.070 --> 41:48.874
- Yes, I would love
to see your room.

41:48.907 --> 41:56.114
*

41:57.616 --> 41:59.217
Thank you.
