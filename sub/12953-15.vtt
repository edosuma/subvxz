00:01.369 --> 00:02.600
Drop your weapons!

00:09.380 --> 00:10.851
I need suppressive fire!

00:12.000 --> 00:18.074

01:08.641 --> 01:09.970
You wanted to see me?

01:10.436 --> 01:12.051
Has Vaughn contacted you yet?

01:15.652 --> 01:17.886
I'd have mentioned it, don't you think?

01:18.353 --> 01:21.257
Sydney, we pulled Vaughn's phone records,

01:21.349 --> 01:25.876
and they indicate that he sent you an SM message to your cell.

01:27.933 --> 01:29.691
I would like to give you the benefit of the doubt

01:29.784 --> 01:34.408
and assume that it got lost in transmission and that you never received it.

01:35.390 --> 01:38.670
If you're looking to catch me in a lie, yes, I got the message.

01:40.210 --> 01:45.030
When Vaughn took off, as I've already told you, I tried to stop him.

01:45.870 --> 01:46.960
He hit me.

01:47.709 --> 01:51.043
He contacted me to tell me he was sorry.

01:51.229 --> 01:53.989
Which I didn't consider professionally relevant.

01:54.954 --> 01:58.476
As far as where he is or what he's doing, I still have no idea.

02:00.206 --> 02:02.679
He disappeared with a dangerous piece of technology.

02:02.772 --> 02:05.437
I have no choice but to notify Langley.

02:05.530 --> 02:08.098
Vaughn isn't a traitor. He would never do what he's doing without a reason.

02:08.144 --> 02:12.289
Vaughn went rogue on a sanctioned mission.

02:12.569 --> 02:14.183
Out of consideration for you,

02:14.836 --> 02:18.028
I'll give him 48 hours to either return

02:18.119 --> 02:20.592
or contact me with an explanation.

02:20.638 --> 02:24.784
In the meantime, we will withhold his status from the rest of A.P.O.

02:25.251 --> 02:26.434
Should this matter come to light,

02:26.528 --> 02:29.814
I don't want anyone else complicit in this deception.

02:30.000 --> 02:30.850
Thank you.

02:32.160 --> 02:33.342
Sydney?

02:34.044 --> 02:36.278
If Vaughn should contact you...

02:36.697 --> 02:38.025
You'll know.

02:51.634 --> 02:52.484
Non, merci.

03:02.493 --> 03:03.628
Going somewhere?

03:05.124 --> 03:06.737
- You're late.
- Hardly.

03:06.877 --> 03:08.634
I've been watching you for an hour.

03:08.728 --> 03:10.342
Yeah? Am I your type?

03:10.528 --> 03:14.005
Had to make sure you came alone, followed instructions.

03:14.145 --> 03:15.377
Beignet?

03:15.468 --> 03:16.891
Can we just get this done?

03:17.405 --> 03:19.210
Look around. It's Paris in the springtime.

03:19.302 --> 03:20.724
I'm only interested in answers.

03:20.818 --> 03:22.862
In exchange, you were supposed to bring me something today.

03:22.954 --> 03:24.233
Your big prize is in a safe place.

03:24.327 --> 03:25.750
That's not the deal.

03:25.889 --> 03:27.168
It is now.

03:28.430 --> 03:29.853
You're bluffing.

03:30.835 --> 03:33.116
Don't forget, I know how desperate you are.

03:33.770 --> 03:35.956
No way you're willing to walk away.

03:36.002 --> 03:38.189
Oh, I suppose that depends on how badly you want it.

03:38.284 --> 03:41.091
'Cause personally, what the hell am I gonna do with a transforming coil?

03:41.183 --> 03:42.797
Talking personally?

03:43.076 --> 03:44.977
I don't have a use for it either.

03:45.116 --> 03:47.973
Well, then you can tell your employer exactly what I'm telling you.

03:48.047 --> 03:51.427
You'll get the coil when you tell me everything you know about my father.

04:03.213 --> 04:04.590
- A volcano?
- Yeah. Yeah.

04:04.727 --> 04:07.727
It's all of yellowstone. It's like a funnel.

04:07.867 --> 04:11.964
And the thing is that on average, it blows every 600,000 years.

04:12.037 --> 04:13.555
Well, then I don't think we have to worry about it.

04:13.648 --> 04:17.793
No, no, no. It hasn't blown for 600,030 years. We're due, sister.

04:17.885 --> 04:19.308
What is this? Fancy chocolate?

04:19.402 --> 04:20.014
That's not for you.

04:20.105 --> 04:21.958
No, it is. I like fancy chocolate.

04:22.050 --> 04:23.950
Where is the freezer bag? I left it in the car.

04:24.044 --> 04:25.227
- I'll get it.
- No, no, no, no, no.

04:25.350 --> 04:26.533
You chill.

04:33.829 --> 04:34.441
Hello?

04:34.532 --> 04:37.675
You have a collect call from prisoner 41958

04:37.722 --> 04:39.671
from the Quantico women's detention center.

04:39.764 --> 04:41.951
- Do you accept the charges?
- Yes, I do.

04:42.231 --> 04:44.512
- Nadia?
- Hello, Katya.

04:44.606 --> 04:45.838
I was worried about you.

04:45.979 --> 04:48.165
I'm sorry. I couldn't get away yesterday,

04:48.258 --> 04:49.759
but I'm planning to visit tomorrow.

04:49.850 --> 04:51.417
That's wonderful.

04:51.511 --> 04:53.316
I have a little gift for you.

04:53.409 --> 04:56.600
Forgive me for calling. It's just that your visits,

04:56.694 --> 04:58.402
it makes this place bearable.

04:58.494 --> 04:59.822
I'll be there tomorrow.

05:06.040 --> 05:08.419
Uh, you heard from Vaughn?

05:08.465 --> 05:09.983
Mnh-mnh. Not yet.

05:10.075 --> 05:11.499
It's got to be tough on him, right?

05:14.164 --> 05:16.589
Going to visit your uncle, and all you can do is watch him die,

05:16.683 --> 05:18.106
nothing you can do about it?

05:18.197 --> 05:18.904
Yeah.

05:19.698 --> 05:21.408
My mom used to do stuff like that.

05:21.500 --> 05:22.542
Like what?

05:22.634 --> 05:23.865
Scrub the sink

05:24.146 --> 05:27.717
when she was worried about stuff that was out of her control.

05:27.763 --> 05:28.899
I like a clean sink.

05:28.992 --> 05:29.745
Mm-hmm.

05:29.931 --> 05:32.595
But you would tell me if there was something that I needed to be concerned about?

05:33.016 --> 05:34.963
Of course.

05:36.973 --> 05:38.826
Yeah, it's me. No deal.

05:39.712 --> 05:42.665
He says he has the coil but he wants answers first.

05:45.283 --> 05:46.658
He wants to talk to you.

05:48.995 --> 05:49.825
Hello?

05:49.917 --> 05:51.722
You violated our agreement.

05:51.768 --> 05:54.195
You listen to me. I'm sick and tired of these games.

05:54.288 --> 05:55.758
Here's how we're gonna do things.

05:55.850 --> 05:57.368
You're angry? Good.

05:57.461 --> 05:59.984
You  can channel that into your next assignment.

06:00.075 --> 06:03.077
No, no. No more assignments. You got what you asked for.

06:03.151 --> 06:04.907
You didn't abide by the terms of our deal.

06:05.234 --> 06:06.656
The price has just gone up.

06:06.796 --> 06:09.842
Disobey again, and it will continue to do so.

06:09.935 --> 06:10.976
No, that's it. I'm done.

06:11.069 --> 06:13.924
- Check beneath the table.
- What?

06:14.765 --> 06:17.907
Beneath the table there's an envelope. Open it.

06:37.317 --> 06:40.363
If you still wish to back out, feel free to do so.

06:43.729 --> 06:44.913
He's alive.

06:45.847 --> 06:47.682
Your  father is very much alive.

06:48.102 --> 06:51.721
The question, Mr. Vaughn, is how far are you willing to go to find him?

07:36.901 --> 07:38.227
That was lovely.

07:38.928 --> 07:43.407
It's a folk song our father used to sing about a russian robin hood.

07:43.547 --> 07:45.544
It was one of your mother's favorites.

07:47.273 --> 07:49.555
So good to see you again, sweetheart.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.876
- Shouldn't be a problem.
- Sorry, I just --

07:55.624 --> 07:58.528
Well, considering the hearings, I'm sure the D.D.O. has his hands full.

07:58.667 --> 08:00.948
Of course. Give my regards.

08:01.323 --> 08:03.270
Sorry, um, requisition forms.

08:03.363 --> 08:05.024
The secure server to Langley went down.

08:05.119 --> 08:08.499
I did what I could, but I'll need all-new servers and a VS-2 module, so...

08:08.591 --> 08:11.255
Great. If you could also sign here...

08:12.563 --> 08:15.372
Uh, by the way, since the, you know, incident,

08:16.071 --> 08:18.115
have you had a chance to see a doctor?

08:18.581 --> 08:21.294
'Cause the radiation levels in that chamber were near-lethal, so...

08:21.388 --> 08:23.239
I'm fine, Marshall. Is there anything else?

08:23.332 --> 08:25.757
No. Thank you.

08:59.235 --> 09:01.995
Our family didn't have much. Just the necessities.

09:02.368 --> 09:06.131
But your mother had no intention of denying herself.

09:06.223 --> 09:09.079
After school, she would go to the St. Basil cathedral

09:09.265 --> 09:12.550
where all the tourists were, so careless with their money,

09:12.644 --> 09:15.117
so easy to pickpocket.

09:16.051 --> 09:18.238
- How old was she?
- Young.

09:18.377 --> 09:19.561
Still in grade school.

09:21.383 --> 09:24.048
She used the money to buy us candy

09:24.936 --> 09:27.744
until our father discovered what she had been doing.

09:28.397 --> 09:30.298
Yelena and I were terrified, but not your mother.

09:30.343 --> 09:35.540
She stood there finishing the candy, smiling.

09:36.053 --> 09:38.049
We were waiting for her to get hit,

09:38.469 --> 09:44.333
but instead our father laughed looking at this little rebel in front of him.

09:44.800 --> 09:48.324
Your mother can be quite stubborn, much like your sister.

09:53.701 --> 09:54.934
How is Sydney?

09:56.195 --> 09:57.235
Katya, I've told you --

09:57.320 --> 10:00.610
I know, I know. She's off limits.

10:02.430 --> 10:03.570
Thank you.

10:07.080 --> 10:08.260
Of course.

10:11.957 --> 10:13.284
My mother --

10:13.377 --> 10:15.945
Irina -- did she ever talk about me?

10:17.300 --> 10:19.345
It's happening sooner than I expected.

10:19.390 --> 10:20.479
What's happening?

10:25.108 --> 10:27.773
I'm deathly allergic to chocolate.

10:29.267 --> 10:30.645
In 15 seconds,

10:32.468 --> 10:34.350
my breathing will become difficult.

10:34.444 --> 10:35.294
Katya --

10:35.414 --> 10:37.506
And I will lose consciousness.

10:39.984 --> 10:44.129
Tell Sydney this is how far I'm willing to go to see her.

10:44.316 --> 10:46.694
Guard! I need help now!

10:47.300 --> 10:49.488
- Tell Sydney!
- Guard!

10:50.935 --> 10:52.121
I know what you're thinking.

10:52.400 --> 10:54.014
You'll find them on your own, right?

10:55.134 --> 10:55.936
What are we doing here?

10:56.011 --> 10:59.870
Waiting. I hired a team of independent contractors to help us with the job.

10:59.962 --> 11:00.860
Which is what?

11:00.953 --> 11:03.202
- Assume that's not important.
- Assume it is to me.

11:03.294 --> 11:07.425
All you need to know is it's an instruction manual of sorts.

11:07.751 --> 11:09.748
Now that coil you got for us --

11:10.120 --> 11:11.878
apparently it wasn't being used properly.

11:11.971 --> 11:14.396
That's terrific. Like I said, I don't care about the coil.

11:14.957 --> 11:17.507
I'm just like you, man.

11:17.555 --> 11:19.042
The less I know, the less guilt I feel.

11:19.134 --> 11:20.652
Yeah, we're a lot alike.

11:20.885 --> 11:23.072
Where do you think he was during the funeral?

11:24.427 --> 11:28.095
I mean, when you were mourning by his grave with your mom.

11:28.936 --> 11:30.452
You know, it's usually a girlfriend.

11:31.668 --> 11:33.663
At least that's why my old man took off.

11:34.552 --> 11:36.308
But I tell you what. My mom --

11:37.131 --> 11:39.079
can't say I really blame him.

11:44.597 --> 11:45.684
Coming?

11:50.080 --> 11:51.312
Waste of time.

11:52.059 --> 11:55.104
.45 caliber. It's not like you need to make it more dangerous.

11:55.665 --> 11:58.281
Maybe not, but it makes me feel better.

12:00.620 --> 12:02.090
You said an hour.

12:02.837 --> 12:04.690
Yeah, well, we had to take a detour.

12:05.435 --> 12:06.459
This is Mike.

12:07.889 --> 12:11.125
So is he any good, or just eye candy?

12:11.219 --> 12:15.269
Like I said, he's the man with the technical skills to get what we need done.

12:15.362 --> 12:18.552
That's Sabina, this is Gregor, and that's Jan over there.

12:18.645 --> 12:21.213
Mikey, pour you a pint.

12:22.101 --> 12:24.241
I don't usually drink till the job's finished.

12:24.334 --> 12:27.428
You drink with me, or you cut bullets with Jan. Your choice.

12:27.521 --> 12:30.185
Yeah, well, how about I do neither and you tell me why the hell we're here.

12:32.382 --> 12:34.521
Okay, so this is a two-pronged plan.

12:35.315 --> 12:36.595
Now, tomorrow at midnight,

12:36.642 --> 12:40.500
an armored transport will be leaving Darmstadt carried a very valuable item.

12:40.778 --> 12:42.726
We will be stealing that item.

12:43.333 --> 12:45.713
But to do it, we're gonna need a cold laser.

12:46.086 --> 12:48.368
Prototype has not even hit the streets yet.

12:48.834 --> 12:52.453
It's in a secure R&D wing in a private hospital in Bordeaux.

12:52.968 --> 12:54.390
Heavily guarded.

12:54.465 --> 12:55.506
C ivilians?

12:55.646 --> 12:57.306
Yeah. You got a problem with that?

12:59.083 --> 12:59.885
No.

13:03.765 --> 13:05.188
I got your message. What is it?

13:05.796 --> 13:08.126
Dixon has been taken out of the field of rotation.

13:08.218 --> 13:10.071
I know. I authorized it.

13:10.305 --> 13:12.825
Yes, I see your signature all over the release forms.

13:13.712 --> 13:16.043
Do you really think we can afford to be down one agent

13:16.135 --> 13:17.844
when Vaughn's whereabouts are still unknown?

13:17.937 --> 13:19.170
We didn't have a choice.

13:19.495 --> 13:21.968
The director of the DSR contacted me directly.

13:22.108 --> 13:25.872
And since for the moment we're keeping Vaughn's status confidential,

13:26.132 --> 13:28.462
I thought it best to comply with his request.

13:28.649 --> 13:29.736
I see.

13:30.109 --> 13:32.727
What exactly is the nature of Dixon's assignment?

13:33.193 --> 13:34.903
I'm afraid that's confidential as well.

13:34.996 --> 13:36.753
From you or from me?

13:39.183 --> 13:43.280
Come on, Jack, you don't have to be a genius to know what this is about.

13:44.776 --> 13:46.103
Rambaldi.

13:47.225 --> 13:49.794
Now while I accept that these matters are above my purview,

13:49.886 --> 13:51.882
Dixon is a member of my task force,

13:51.976 --> 13:56.072
and it's my responsibility to know what actions and risks he's taking on.

13:57.989 --> 13:59.650
It's a routine transport.

14:00.538 --> 14:01.482
Darmstadt.

14:01.622 --> 14:04.811
And I assure you the risks are minimal.

14:04.932 --> 14:08.982
Syd, Clippers tickets. Third row, center. I can't go.

14:09.216 --> 14:11.068
Langley's tasked me for a special assignment.

14:11.160 --> 14:12.105
You're kidding.

14:12.292 --> 14:14.144
Well, I would love to, but I'm swamped.

14:14.237 --> 14:15.516
And I was going to go with my son,

14:15.889 --> 14:19.843
so I tell him I can't go. He says it's actually good because he has a date.

14:19.916 --> 14:20.669
He's 12.

14:20.764 --> 14:22.089
Why doesn't he take her to the game?

14:22.229 --> 14:23.891
Apparently she'd rather go to a movie.

14:23.984 --> 14:25.148
I'm sure you've taught him well.

14:25.241 --> 14:27.284
- Dinner when I get back?
- Yeah. Sure.

14:29.575 --> 14:30.662
We need to talk.

14:33.282 --> 14:34.416
How long have you been seeing her?

14:34.603 --> 14:35.738
It was our third visit.

14:37.749 --> 14:38.743
This is --

14:39.021 --> 14:41.638
this is exactly why I warned you about her.

14:41.731 --> 14:42.945
Katya's the only person

14:43.038 --> 14:45.988
who has ever been willing to answer my questions about Irina.

14:46.081 --> 14:48.317
Irina Derevko was manipulative and cruel.

14:48.409 --> 14:50.118
She was also our mother.

14:50.211 --> 14:52.492
Which makes it harder to accept, I know, but trust me --

14:52.585 --> 14:54.152
I know her crimes.

14:54.430 --> 14:57.335
I also know how once she helped you and the CIA.

14:57.428 --> 15:00.234
Until she betrayed us. She always did.

15:00.328 --> 15:03.041
There's more to her than what's in her file.

15:03.088 --> 15:04.700
Katya told me stories.

15:05.026 --> 15:06.306
And you believed her?

15:06.492 --> 15:07.486
Some of it, yes.

15:07.578 --> 15:09.574
Then you're deluding yourself, Nadia.

15:12.193 --> 15:13.280
I'm sorry.

15:13.607 --> 15:15.698
I've been through this before.

15:16.023 --> 15:18.784
Katya is doing the same thing to you that Irina did to me.

15:18.876 --> 15:20.777
Telling me what I wanted to hear,

15:20.917 --> 15:24.536
appealing to what I wanted more than anything else in the world -- a mother.

15:25.191 --> 15:26.183
A family.

15:28.221 --> 15:29.787
It was all a manipulation.

15:33.058 --> 15:35.580
Do you want to know the truth about our mother?

15:37.871 --> 15:40.105
Our mother put a hit on my life.

15:43.050 --> 15:45.572
Our mother tried to have me killed.

15:47.676 --> 15:49.959
Why didn't you tell me?

15:50.239 --> 15:51.948
There was never a reason to.

15:53.397 --> 15:57.544
Oh, my god, Syd. If I knew, I --

16:00.815 --> 16:03.241
Where is she? Katya?

16:04.502 --> 16:05.973
She's in the hospital.

16:06.767 --> 16:08.810
They're keeping her for observation.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.711
I always hated going to the doctor.

16:58.767 --> 17:00.095
Let's go get the laser.

17:20.017 --> 17:20.723
There it is.

17:26.710 --> 17:27.703
I need some light.

17:30.649 --> 17:31.737
How long will this take?

17:32.437 --> 17:35.197
Hold still. We can't risk destroying the emitter.

17:35.291 --> 17:36.284
Wire cutters.

17:38.388 --> 17:40.001
Can't we just unplug it or something?

17:40.093 --> 17:41.135
Sure, if you don't mind blowing it up

17:41.227 --> 17:42.842
and killing us both in the process.

17:43.075 --> 17:45.071
Argon canister. It's under pressure.

17:45.772 --> 17:47.052
So you're CIA.

17:47.330 --> 17:48.945
Is that what Roberts told you?

17:49.037 --> 17:51.225
He said you were in a period of transition.

17:51.457 --> 17:52.881
I guess you could say that.

17:53.019 --> 17:54.682
I went through the training program.

17:55.008 --> 17:55.857
Camp Perry.

17:56.604 --> 18:00.034
Cia was looking for female agents with russian language skills.

18:00.406 --> 18:02.019
They rejected me.

18:02.207 --> 18:03.342
Yeah, but you're probably better off.

18:03.622 --> 18:06.668
That's what I figure. More profit...

18:08.396 --> 18:10.012
and more fun, too.

18:13.378 --> 18:14.658
This should do it.

18:15.638 --> 18:17.634
Let me help.

18:17.728 --> 18:19.006
I'm good, thanks.

18:39.944 --> 18:41.366
Bon. D'accord.

18:59.232 --> 18:59.891
Look out!

19:03.560 --> 19:04.456
Let's go.

19:09.486 --> 19:10.718
We need to leave now.

19:16.376 --> 19:20.570
You could use a few stitches, I suppose.

19:20.661 --> 19:21.797
That  won't be necessary.

19:22.545 --> 19:25.735
Fine. Let it scar. Who knows?

19:25.827 --> 19:27.871
It might toughen you up a bit.

19:29.460 --> 19:32.221
I saw the look on your face when I killed that guard.

19:33.062 --> 19:34.389
I saved your life.

19:35.744 --> 19:36.547
Thanks.

19:38.135 --> 19:40.752
Don't tell me you're torn up inside.

19:42.369 --> 19:44.795
I thought you agency boys were tougher than that.

19:44.841 --> 19:47.171
It was him or me. I'm okay with that.

19:47.264 --> 19:48.878
You could have fooled me.

19:49.018 --> 19:51.777
You haven't stopped brooding since we left the hospital.

19:51.871 --> 19:56.064
Yeah, well, maybe it's because I don't like being here with you.

19:59.617 --> 20:01.326
You know what I think?

20:02.821 --> 20:05.917
This is exactly where you want to be.

20:24.997 --> 20:29.446
Consider this the second time you've been rejected by the CIA.

20:38.846 --> 20:40.126
Understand this.

20:40.405 --> 20:45.171
Talk to my sister again, I will make sure you regret it.

20:45.263 --> 20:48.071
The protective sister. How charming.

20:49.193 --> 20:51.476
And how satisfying it must be for you to know

20:51.568 --> 20:53.277
you have it all figured out.

20:54.354 --> 20:55.822
I would think you of all people

20:55.916 --> 20:58.770
should know the world is never black or white.

20:59.283 --> 21:01.374
The last time I saw you, aunt Katya,

21:01.468 --> 21:02.844
you tried to put a bullet in my head.

21:03.965 --> 21:06.773
Given the opportunity, I wouldn't mind seeing you suffer.

21:08.362 --> 21:10.214
Consider this visit a warning.

21:11.130 --> 21:12.887
Leave Nadia alone.

21:13.449 --> 21:17.259
I had no intention of killing you, nor did your mother.

21:21.886 --> 21:23.168
What do you know about that?

21:26.815 --> 21:31.200
I know you believe your mother put out a contract on your life.

21:31.949 --> 21:36.619
Surely you must have asked yourself why she would want you eliminated.

21:36.757 --> 21:40.377
And I'm willing to bet you haven't come up with a satisfying answer.

21:40.984 --> 21:42.312
Your mother loved you.

21:42.966 --> 21:46.155
And to look at you now and see how quickly you've abandoned her --

21:46.248 --> 21:47.862
if she only knew, she would be ashamed.

21:47.937 --> 21:49.262
I'm not having this conversation.

21:49.309 --> 21:51.543
Before dying, Irina tried to contact me.

21:52.524 --> 21:54.807
She believed someone was setting her up,

21:54.992 --> 22:00.093
wanting it to appear that she was trying to have you killed.

22:00.560 --> 22:02.700
I need you to get me that message.

22:02.885 --> 22:03.974
Bring it to me.

22:05.077 --> 22:07.503
It's the least you could do for her.

22:14.285 --> 22:15.258
Marshall.

22:16.129 --> 22:17.982
Mr. Sloane.

22:18.074 --> 22:20.167
Hey. Sorry. You know the classics.

22:20.258 --> 22:21.394
Never go out of style.

22:21.488 --> 22:24.820
A test tube was sent to forensics for analysis. Did you authorize that?

22:26.317 --> 22:27.051
Yes.

22:27.611 --> 22:28.701
Yes, I did. Uh...

22:30.148 --> 22:31.189
Is that a problem, or...

22:31.328 --> 22:33.181
There's no problem. Just a curiosity.

22:34.114 --> 22:38.307
It's indicated that the blood sample was one of Dr. Vlachko's test subjects.

22:38.447 --> 22:40.205
I thought we already analyzed those.

22:40.298 --> 22:42.247
Am I missing something, Marshall?

22:42.386 --> 22:45.337
Uh, you know what? I haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately.

22:45.429 --> 22:47.425
Mitchell's got an ear infection,

22:47.520 --> 22:50.375
and I just probably forgot to send it in. Sorry.

22:50.561 --> 22:51.411
Sorry about that.

22:52.438 --> 22:54.197
Did the results come back?

22:54.756 --> 22:56.656
It's nothing we didn't already know.

22:56.748 --> 22:59.416
The subject was suffering from a large-scale genetic mutation.

23:00.114 --> 23:01.441
However, Marshall,

23:02.049 --> 23:04.429
I want you to know there are protocols in this office.

23:05.410 --> 23:07.691
I'm sure your failure to notify me of this submission

23:08.253 --> 23:10.605
is also due to your lack of sleep, yes?

23:10.663 --> 23:13.005
Yes. It probably was.

23:13.330 --> 23:15.450
I'm very tired, and I'm not...

23:21.201 --> 23:22.719
Why complicate our life?

23:22.813 --> 23:25.955
We could get on and off without the transport even knowing they were hit.

23:26.095 --> 23:27.756
That item we want is extremely delicate.

23:27.848 --> 23:29.798
I mean, we can't risk the transfer in a moving vehicle.

23:29.890 --> 23:32.220
I thought you said we were stealing an instruction manual.

23:32.641 --> 23:36.357
We are. A very old one written by an inventor in the 15th century.

23:36.542 --> 23:38.730
You breathe on it wrong, and it will crumble.

23:38.869 --> 23:40.349
Seems like a lot of trouble for an old book.

23:40.442 --> 23:44.052
It's valuable to my employer, so then it's valuable to us.

23:44.800 --> 23:46.557
Okay, it's gonna be a two-car caravan.

23:46.791 --> 23:48.739
The lead car's going to be the armored transport.

23:48.878 --> 23:51.066
It'll be leaving the depot at midnight tonight

23:51.392 --> 23:53.197
traveling along this route.

23:53.290 --> 23:55.334
- We're hitting a CIA convoy?
- That's right.

23:55.427 --> 23:56.803
So this is why you needed me.

23:56.942 --> 23:58.154
From the moment you contacted me,

23:58.247 --> 24:00.673
you knew you'd need that bypass, even if I had given you the coil --

24:00.766 --> 24:03.382
We'd have never told you where your father is. That's right.

24:03.661 --> 24:05.466
Guess that makes us bad people, huh?

24:05.560 --> 24:07.650
Nothing's changed, though. You still want answers.

24:07.696 --> 24:08.690
You son of a bitch.

24:08.829 --> 24:10.826
You know, by the way, you should be thanking me.

24:11.153 --> 24:13.195
- You should be grateful.
- Thanking you for what?

24:13.287 --> 24:14.615
For tracking your father down.

24:15.034 --> 24:17.125
Let me tell you something. That wasn't no small feat.

24:17.311 --> 24:18.544
Your father's been hiding for the past --

24:18.638 --> 24:20.442
You're asking me to betray my agency.

24:20.534 --> 24:22.054
Well, I feel really bad about that.

24:22.547 --> 24:25.546
You know what? I'll say an extra Hail Mary tonight before I go to bed.

24:26.200 --> 24:27.528
If I do this, I can't go back.

24:28.807 --> 24:32.143
That has a certain poetry to it, doesn't it?

24:32.983 --> 24:34.788
Like father, like son.

24:35.659 --> 24:36.557
Me?

24:36.742 --> 24:38.022
I came this far,

24:38.581 --> 24:40.434
I'd have crossed the finish line.

24:40.620 --> 24:41.996
But like I said

24:42.182 --> 24:43.318
I'm a bad guy.

24:46.076 --> 24:49.267
Oh, guess what? Your dad is, too.

24:50.154 --> 24:52.246
I mean, he's not being held prisoner.

24:52.899 --> 24:57.666
And for 25 years, he allowed his wife and his kid to think that he's been dead?

24:58.974 --> 25:00.589
That's a bad guy.

25:01.944 --> 25:04.800
You think on that. I'll be inside.

25:17.287 --> 25:18.566
I need to speak with you.

25:19.266 --> 25:20.737
Of course. What is it?

25:21.063 --> 25:24.589
I wanted to tell you before you were notified through official channels.

25:24.868 --> 25:26.864
I've been visiting Katya Derevko.

25:28.125 --> 25:33.016
Your aunt? And I assume it's not on official business.

25:33.063 --> 25:34.253
No. It was personal.

25:34.599 --> 25:38.974
I thought Katya might be able to fill in the blanks about my mother,

25:39.252 --> 25:40.676
tell me who she was.

25:42.873 --> 25:43.866
I see.

25:44.239 --> 25:45.042
Well...

25:45.929 --> 25:47.017
thank you for telling me.

25:50.244 --> 25:51.142
Nadia?

25:53.152 --> 25:54.337
What did she tell you?

25:54.570 --> 25:56.087
Nothing I didn't already know.

25:56.740 --> 25:59.167
That she was a criminal. A murderer.

26:03.543 --> 26:08.023
Sweetheart, no one is a single thing.

26:09.426 --> 26:12.041
Look, I understood Irina.

26:12.275 --> 26:14.606
We were both cut from the same cloth.

26:14.747 --> 26:17.124
Both committed to our work.

26:17.544 --> 26:19.493
And I suppose because of that,

26:19.586 --> 26:22.108
we both did some things that are unforgivable.

26:22.995 --> 26:23.940
But, Nadia,

26:25.248 --> 26:29.824
Irina is also capable of having a great capacity for love.

26:30.431 --> 26:32.187
I saw the way she looked at Sydney.

26:33.591 --> 26:36.187
The way she held that child in her arms.

26:37.684 --> 26:40.683
And I am absolutely sure she felt the same way about you.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.407
She searched for you, Nadia.

26:46.511 --> 26:49.415
She may not be here to answer your questions,

26:51.051 --> 26:53.238
but the one thing I know to be true --

26:55.435 --> 26:57.478
your mother loved you.

26:58.460 --> 26:59.787
I'd like to believe that.

27:02.172 --> 27:02.975
Then do.

27:20.233 --> 27:21.561
Have a wonderful day.

27:24.039 --> 27:26.370
Hi, I'm here to pick up a repair.

27:26.462 --> 27:29.128
Of course. You have the service ticket?

27:29.266 --> 27:32.745
Nope, just the number. 112402.

27:32.838 --> 27:34.595
Give me just a moment.

27:48.065 --> 27:49.679
Quite lovely, isn't it?

27:51.501 --> 27:52.446
Open it.

28:06.196 --> 28:08.185
How much do I owe you?

28:08.324 --> 28:11.276
Nothing. It's already been paid for.

28:12.444 --> 28:14.440
- Have a lovely day.
- Thank you.

28:18.276 --> 28:19.105
Hello?

28:21.490 --> 28:22.387
Hello?

28:25.848 --> 28:26.506
Vaughn?

28:33.007 --> 28:34.096
Vaughn, say something.

28:51.170 --> 28:52.449
We're gonna do this my way.

28:52.823 --> 28:54.531
You want to pull this off, I'm taking charge.

28:54.624 --> 28:55.618
Sure thing.

28:55.990 --> 28:58.465
That truck will be heavily guarded,

28:58.557 --> 28:59.933
loaded with state-of-the-art surveillance.

29:00.027 --> 29:01.831
I want RF jammers on every team member.

29:06.461 --> 29:09.556
Now, an item this important, the CIA is gonna use their best agents.

29:09.696 --> 29:12.456
Even the smallest mistake will compromise our mission.

29:12.689 --> 29:14.303
We can use the cold laser to open the safe,

29:14.397 --> 29:17.492
but without the proper code, the safe's backup system will engage.

29:18.006 --> 29:20.766
Once we're inside, I'll bypass the safe's backup system

29:20.859 --> 29:22.712
while Sabina sets up the cold laser.

29:22.851 --> 29:24.084
We'll have no more than three minutes.

29:37.788 --> 29:38.734
One last thing,

29:38.966 --> 29:40.580
because there'll be no shooting on this job.

29:40.906 --> 29:42.234
CIA protocol.

29:42.373 --> 29:44.417
They will not fire unless fired upon first.

29:45.539 --> 29:48.635
If anyone has a problem with anything I just said, speak up now.

29:48.773 --> 29:50.341
- We understood?
- All right.

29:50.433 --> 29:50.995
All right.

30:09.429 --> 30:10.517
You have a minute?

30:11.265 --> 30:12.019
Of course.

30:14.731 --> 30:17.683
I wanted to apologize about going to Katya.

30:17.869 --> 30:18.863
I should have told you.

30:19.002 --> 30:20.425
You don't have to apologize.

30:21.640 --> 30:26.053
When I found out Arvin Sloane was my father, I was horrified.

30:26.755 --> 30:31.998
My entire life I wanted to meet my parents, and the truth was so...

30:32.092 --> 30:33.163
ugly.

30:33.863 --> 30:37.819
But he's changed. There's good in him.

30:38.426 --> 30:41.952
I guess I was hoping the same thing was true for our mother.

30:42.259 --> 30:44.734
- I'm sorry.
- Me too.

30:47.117 --> 30:50.070
That's Eric. We're going out for lunch. You want to come?

30:50.210 --> 30:52.301
No, thanks. I'm just gonna hang out here.

30:52.441 --> 30:54.055
- Okay.
- Have fun.

32:24.194 --> 32:25.525
Here we go.

33:09.126 --> 33:10.167
We've secured the hole.

33:10.399 --> 33:13.447
Copy, strike team. They're clueless. No idea you're hitching a ride.

33:15.177 --> 33:16.981
110 seconds till x-fer.

33:17.729 --> 33:18.913
Now we'll see how good you really are.

33:20.081 --> 33:20.836
Oh, I'm good.

33:23.669 --> 33:25.187
You got 95 seconds.

33:32.766 --> 33:34.333
- How you doing?
- Ready.

33:44.248 --> 33:45.242
Almost there.

33:51.509 --> 33:52.694
All right, here we go.

33:55.828 --> 33:57.059
Nice timing.

33:58.695 --> 34:00.357
Strike team, report. What's going on?

34:01.948 --> 34:03.571
- What the hell is going on?
- Package secured.

34:18.199 --> 34:19.717
Strike team, get ready for impact.

34:27.668 --> 34:28.565
Turn back.

34:31.886 --> 34:32.639
Let's go.

34:37.643 --> 34:38.732
Drop the weapons!

34:43.598 --> 34:44.286
No!

34:48.635 --> 34:50.917
I need suppressive fire! Now!

35:14.166 --> 35:15.301
Come on! We can still get away!

35:38.005 --> 35:39.784
Dixon, report. Do you copy?

35:39.922 --> 35:41.584
Two hostages escaped into the tunnel!

35:41.677 --> 35:43.625
Hostages in tunnel. Do you copy?

35:56.911 --> 35:58.429
Got to hand it to you, man.

35:58.757 --> 36:00.990
You a closer. Let's see 'em.

36:02.205 --> 36:03.295
Where's the manuscript?

36:06.989 --> 36:08.650
He's been dead all along, hasn't he?

36:08.743 --> 36:09.119
What?

36:09.213 --> 36:10.970
My father would never have done this.

36:11.111 --> 36:12.246
Man, have you lost your mind?!

36:12.385 --> 36:14.716
My father's dead, you son of a bitch, and you used that.

36:14.809 --> 36:19.289
The truth! I want to hear you say it. He's been dead all along.

36:19.382 --> 36:20.423
Man, you've seen the pictures!

36:20.518 --> 36:21.939
Yeah, I've seen a lot of things.

36:22.639 --> 36:24.492
All right, you want me to say it? Fine. He's been --

36:26.643 --> 36:29.404
The truth! Tell me the truth!

36:30.106 --> 36:31.480
Whoa! Okay. Okay.

36:32.601 --> 36:34.934
He's dead, man. Okay? He's dead.

36:35.072 --> 36:36.448
- What else?
- What?

36:36.915 --> 36:38.337
The rest of it. How'd he die?

36:38.430 --> 36:40.283
- Man, you know the rest!
- Say it!

36:41.218 --> 36:42.927
Irina Derevko killed him.

36:44.282 --> 36:47.234
The pictures, the witnesses, the journals -- everything was fake.

36:47.700 --> 36:49.077
Everything.

36:50.385 --> 36:52.236
Who else? Who set me up?

36:52.330 --> 36:54.421
- Who do you work for?
- Please, you know --

37:03.169 --> 37:04.303
Who do you work for?!

37:05.126 --> 37:06.101
Tell me!

37:14.005 --> 37:15.027
Sloane.

37:15.493 --> 37:17.250
I work for Sloane.

37:30.582 --> 37:31.815
You found the message.

37:32.142 --> 37:33.039
Bank records.

37:33.319 --> 37:36.081
Payments to the assassin who tried to kill me.

37:36.173 --> 37:38.072
- The records exonerate Irina.
- Yes.

37:38.213 --> 37:41.785
Sydney, whoever did this,

37:43.093 --> 37:46.189
for your mother, my sister, we have to make it right.

37:46.375 --> 37:47.416
We have --

37:49.660 --> 37:51.036
You already know who it was.

37:53.000 --> 37:56.526
My mother traced the bank payments to their source.

37:57.178 --> 37:58.697
She discovered who it was.

38:00.146 --> 38:01.091
In that case --

38:02.447 --> 38:04.969
Oh, if I would have gotten the message in time.

38:05.155 --> 38:06.625
She would still be alive.

38:08.730 --> 38:09.771
Who is it?

38:14.120 --> 38:17.503
Before I tell you, you must promise me

38:19.092 --> 38:21.041
Nadia can never know.

38:28.355 --> 38:31.644
You're probably gonna want to kill me when I tell you this, but

38:32.064 --> 38:33.344
I ran some tests.

38:33.530 --> 38:34.523
What kind of tests?

38:35.598 --> 38:38.407
You may be very sick, Mr. Bristow.

38:38.687 --> 38:40.540
Now, you'll need additional bloodwork to be sure --

38:40.586 --> 38:42.295
I thought I made myself clear, Marshall.

38:42.481 --> 38:44.144
This is not something I care to discuss.

38:44.236 --> 38:46.567
I understand. Just hear me out. You have a mutation.

38:46.661 --> 38:48.034
Marshall, I've heard enough.

38:48.156 --> 38:50.056
Damn it, you may not care what happens to you,

38:50.430 --> 38:52.044
but what happens to you affects other people.

38:52.137 --> 38:54.087
Sydney, for example. Have you thought about that?

38:54.225 --> 38:55.934
You need to see a doctor now.

38:59.535 --> 39:00.671
Is everything all right here?

39:01.887 --> 39:02.957
We were just finishing up.

39:03.170 --> 39:05.502
Yeah. Just finishing up.

39:11.114 --> 39:11.821
Jack...

39:13.224 --> 39:15.008
is there something we need to discuss?

39:25.159 --> 39:25.629
Hi.

39:26.611 --> 39:27.081
Hi.

39:50.846 --> 39:52.842
He's dead, Syd -- my father.

39:55.226 --> 39:56.410
He's been dead all along.

39:58.187 --> 39:58.990
I think.

40:01.564 --> 40:02.604
You know, I've --

40:03.492 --> 40:05.440
I've lived with his death for so long,

40:05.533 --> 40:07.721
I would have done anything just to see him again.

40:09.497 --> 40:11.064
But then I realized that

40:11.391 --> 40:13.912
my father, he would have never left my mom and me,

40:14.005 --> 40:15.094
not for anything.

40:16.122 --> 40:19.646
The man I knew could have never walked away from the people he loved.

40:21.003 --> 40:22.520
How did you know?

40:25.560 --> 40:27.030
'Cause I couldn't either.

40:35.169 --> 40:36.067
It was Sloane.

40:38.311 --> 40:39.590
I should have seen it all along.

40:40.759 --> 40:43.709
I swear to god, Syd, I am gonna kill that son of a bitch.

40:47.451 --> 40:48.730
Come inside.

40:49.804 --> 40:51.371
There's something I have to tell you.

41:00.538 --> 41:01.293
Jack.

41:02.367 --> 41:04.649
I just spoke with Sydney. Vaughn's returned.

41:06.332 --> 41:07.229
Where was he?

41:07.603 --> 41:10.363
I'll be debriefing him tomorrow. He retrieved the coil.

41:10.737 --> 41:13.258
It's on its way to the DSR facility for analysis.

41:13.539 --> 41:14.436
Good.

41:14.529 --> 41:15.522
One more thing.

41:15.708 --> 41:17.896
Dixon ran into some interference abroad.

41:18.269 --> 41:20.026
He's okay. He had his vest on.

41:20.633 --> 41:23.396
But you were right to be concerned.

41:24.609 --> 41:26.510
What about the DSR transport?

41:26.788 --> 41:28.833
The artifact has been secured.

41:30.142 --> 41:30.945
Okay.

41:31.785 --> 41:33.495
Unless there's something else, I'm headed out.

41:33.726 --> 41:36.583
No. Have a good evening, Jack.

41:36.815 --> 41:37.617
You, too.

41:57.825 --> 41:58.914
Mr. Sloane?

41:59.567 --> 42:03.236
I'm sorry to report, Mr. Sloane, we didn't recover the manuscript.

42:03.561 --> 42:05.271
And Roberts hasn't reported in.

42:11.585 --> 42:12.482
I see.

42:16.036 --> 42:17.171
Nothing changes.

42:18.013 --> 42:22.349
Everything proceeds as planned.
