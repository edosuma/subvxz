00:01.000 --> 00:05.005
<i>Coming this fall,</i>
Only Murderers In The Building.

00:05.005 --> 00:07.883
- That's very good. I wrote that.

00:07.883 --> 00:09.134
- What did happen that night?

00:09.134 --> 00:11.470
<i>The killer stabs Bunny, and then leaves</i>

00:11.470 --> 00:13.388
<i>through the hole in
the bottom of my closet.</i>

00:13.388 --> 00:15.933
Bunny said, "14 Savage."

00:15.933 --> 00:17.518
Kreps is Glitter Guy.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.144
<i>But why would Kreps kill Bunny?</i>

00:19.144 --> 00:20.604
<i>I mean, did he want her painting?</i>

00:20.604 --> 00:22.940
- There's no way that you could pull off
a murder this sophisticated.

00:22.940 --> 00:24.233
- I said that's enough!

00:24.233 --> 00:25.526
If I'm so stupid,

00:25.526 --> 00:28.153
<i>how come I was able to land
the smartest woman on the planet?</i>

00:28.153 --> 00:29.321
<i>Every night, I'd go to</i>

00:29.321 --> 00:31.365
<i>the local bar and grill,
the Chicken Chug.</i>

00:31.365 --> 00:34.576
<i>This all has something to do with</i>
All is Not OK In Oklahoma.

00:34.576 --> 00:35.619
<i>You should let this go.</i>

00:35.619 --> 00:37.412
You don't know what she's capable of.

00:37.412 --> 00:39.498
You don't know what she'd do
to get what she wants.

00:39.498 --> 00:42.793
<i>Seriously? You're that terrified
of a podcaster who solved</i>

00:42.793 --> 00:44.211
the murder of Becky Butler?

00:44.211 --> 00:45.879
- Yes.
- Why?

00:45.879 --> 00:47.673
- Because I'm Becky Butler.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.428
- Well, shit.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.060
<i>Before I became one of</i>

01:00.060 --> 01:01.812
<i>the most talked about
people in the country,</i>

01:01.812 --> 01:05.357
<i>Becky Butler,
I had a pretty ordinary life.</i>

01:05.357 --> 01:09.194
<i>Ordinary, that is, if you assume most
ordinary people are pretty miserable.</i>

01:11.989 --> 01:14.992
<i>Which I assume is
a pretty safe assumption.</i>

01:14.992 --> 01:18.829
<i>How long is
too long to stay in a bad situation?</i>

01:18.829 --> 01:21.248
<i>This is what Elizabeth Davies
was pondering</i>

01:21.248 --> 01:23.625
<i>in the winter of 2003.</i>

01:23.625 --> 01:25.836
Daddy, I made you a healthy breakfast.

01:25.836 --> 01:27.546
- Not hungry.

01:27.546 --> 01:28.797
- I think if you got something--

01:30.591 --> 01:32.593
- I ain't fuckin' hungry.

01:35.262 --> 01:37.973
- Mayor Tipton's office.
How can I assist you?

01:37.973 --> 01:40.559
Oh, yes, of course.
Just hold on one second.

01:40.559 --> 01:42.561
Sir? It's your wife.

01:43.228 --> 01:44.479
- Not now.

01:47.482 --> 01:49.735
- I'm so sorry.
He's in a meetin' right now.

01:49.735 --> 01:52.613
Is there anything I can
help you with, Theresa?

02:00.537 --> 02:02.915
Sir, I was gonna get going,
unless you need anything.

02:02.915 --> 02:04.917
- Oh, stay a bit, Becky.

02:05.584 --> 02:07.544
Have a drink with your mayor.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.963
- Oh, I should really get going.

02:12.090 --> 02:13.634
- Are you sure?

02:14.176 --> 02:16.428
- Well, my dad's expecting me,
so good night.

02:17.554 --> 02:18.597
Well, maybe tomorrow.

02:19.348 --> 02:21.350
You're not always gonna
be able to say no to me.

02:23.894 --> 02:26.021
<i>"I need to get out of here,"</i>

02:26.021 --> 02:29.399
<i>were the last words
Elizabeth Davies wrote in her journal</i>

02:29.399 --> 02:31.652
<i>only five days before her left hand</i>

02:31.652 --> 02:34.446
<i>was found in her own mailbox.</i>

03:25.122 --> 03:27.124
This is Channel 37 News,

03:27.124 --> 03:29.751
reporting on the disappearance
of Becky Butler,

03:29.751 --> 03:31.879
a local Chickasha native and a member

03:31.879 --> 03:33.922
of Mayor Tipton's executive team,

03:33.922 --> 03:35.507
who went missing last week.

03:35.507 --> 03:37.342
Authorities have no leads

03:37.342 --> 03:41.096
and are said to be bringing in
outside law enforcement help.

03:41.096 --> 03:43.098
- Nope.

03:44.516 --> 03:46.518
- Excuse me, Ms. Canning?
- Mm-hmm.

03:47.603 --> 03:48.896
- Um, ma'am...

03:49.771 --> 03:51.732
My name is Poppy White.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.358
I'm your biggest fan.
Cute.

03:53.358 --> 03:56.236
Poppy, my favorite bagel.
What can I do for you, Poppy?

03:56.236 --> 03:58.614
- Uh, I... I have a story

03:58.614 --> 04:00.866
that I think would be
a really good podcast.

04:00.866 --> 04:02.576
It's about a young woman

04:02.576 --> 04:05.120
in Oklahoma. She disappeared.

04:05.120 --> 04:07.414
- Lot of girls disappear, Poppy.

04:07.414 --> 04:08.457
- Yeah, but, um,

04:09.458 --> 04:12.044
she was being harassed
by the mayor of a small town,

04:12.044 --> 04:15.923
and his campaign slogan was,
"It's All Gonna Be OK."

04:15.923 --> 04:17.966
Um, "OK" as in "Oklahoma,"

04:17.966 --> 04:21.512
and I thought <i>All is Not OK In Oklahoma</i>

04:21.512 --> 04:23.514
would be a good title for a podcast.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.062
- I like your style.

04:30.687 --> 04:31.730
Missing or dead?

04:32.606 --> 04:34.024
- Excuse me?
- The girl.

04:34.024 --> 04:35.025
- Missing.

04:35.025 --> 04:36.068
- Well, let's hope she's dead.

04:36.068 --> 04:38.779
For it to even have a chance,
I'd really need her dead.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.364
Ideally murdered.
Ooh! And by that mayor.

04:40.364 --> 04:41.823
That would be amazing.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.827
I'm sorry. Uh, what exactly do <i>you</i> want?

04:47.371 --> 04:49.331
- I would like a job, Ms. Canning.

04:50.123 --> 04:53.710
- So, when I discovered
Becky Butler's disappearance,

04:53.710 --> 04:55.754
I just knew that I had to cover it.

04:55.754 --> 04:58.757
Never did I think it would
become such a sensation.

04:58.757 --> 05:01.677
But, a lot of the credit
really has to go to-- Ooh, Poppy.

05:01.677 --> 05:03.178
- Yes, Cinda?

05:03.178 --> 05:04.471
- Turkey sandwich, no lettuce,

05:04.471 --> 05:06.348
no tomato!

05:06.348 --> 05:08.767
No bread. Just some turkey on tinfoil

05:08.767 --> 05:10.185
and a little bread on the side.

05:10.185 --> 05:11.728
Where was I? Oh!

05:11.728 --> 05:14.731
I find the term "genius" to be reductive.

05:15.691 --> 05:19.069
<i>The answer, as it turned out,</i>

05:19.069 --> 05:21.738
<i>we are all Tim Kono.</i>

05:21.738 --> 05:23.991
- "We are all Tim Kono"?

05:23.991 --> 05:26.660
Are people really listening
to this insipid shit?

05:27.244 --> 05:29.496
I need a new Oklahoma.

05:29.496 --> 05:33.166
I will not be the one-hit wonder
of true crime podcasts, Poppy.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.210
I won't. I will not be...

05:35.210 --> 05:37.337
podcast Nickelback.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.881
- Have you given any thought

05:38.881 --> 05:41.592
to my idea about Rose Cooper,

05:41.592 --> 05:44.052
that artist who went
missing years ago?

05:44.052 --> 05:46.346
- Art? Poppy, really?

05:46.346 --> 05:47.764
Do you know what rhymes with art?

05:47.764 --> 05:49.474
- Smart?
- Fart.

05:49.474 --> 05:51.852
As in no one gives a flying fart.

05:53.103 --> 05:56.190
I need something with
famous people, and blood,

05:56.190 --> 05:58.984
and, ideally,
a hot girl with a great rack.

05:58.984 --> 06:02.196
God, I need a murder. A good one.

06:02.196 --> 06:05.490
And I'm tired of waiting
for one to fall into my lap.

06:06.950 --> 06:09.286
God, you are useless!

06:09.286 --> 06:12.372
Fine. I will make this happen
all on my fucking own!

06:16.335 --> 06:18.545
- So Poppy is Becky Butler.
- Yes,

06:18.545 --> 06:20.631
which means Cinda sent a mayor to prison

06:20.631 --> 06:22.799
for killing someone
she knew was still alive.

06:22.799 --> 06:24.301
- And now she's trying to top herself

06:24.301 --> 06:27.513
by sending <i>us</i> to prison
for a murder <i>she</i> committed.

06:27.513 --> 06:29.640
- God, is she good!

06:29.640 --> 06:30.974
What? This is so audacious,

06:30.974 --> 06:32.809
you know. I wish I'd thought of it.

06:32.809 --> 06:34.853
Really. I mean,
I wouldn't have gone <i>as</i> far,

06:34.853 --> 06:36.230
but what <i>commitment</i>, huh?

06:36.230 --> 06:37.189
- Really?

06:37.189 --> 06:38.440
Uh, don't blame the playa.

06:38.440 --> 06:39.900
Blame the game, brah.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.152
- No. Don't do that.

06:42.152 --> 06:44.112
- She was right in front of us all along.

06:44.112 --> 06:46.240
The storyteller artist framing <i>us</i>

06:46.240 --> 06:48.158
to get the hell out of her podcast lane!

06:48.158 --> 06:49.618
- But now, how do we get her?

06:49.618 --> 06:51.453
- It's not gonna be easy,

06:51.453 --> 06:52.663
but I have a plan.

06:52.663 --> 06:54.331
- Ooh. What?

06:58.585 --> 07:02.005
- I'm sorry. I thought a plan would,
uh, come to me in that moment,

07:02.005 --> 07:03.882
but, uh, no.

07:03.882 --> 07:05.050
Nothing.

07:05.050 --> 07:06.426
Although...

07:08.262 --> 07:10.430
Oh. No.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.599
- Okay, we have
a ton on Oklahoma,

07:12.599 --> 07:13.725
but on Bunny's murder?

07:13.725 --> 07:16.061
- Well, we know she's working
with Detective Kreps.

07:16.061 --> 07:18.856
- But, how does "14 Savage"
relate to Cinda?

07:18.856 --> 07:20.566
- We still have the knife,

07:20.566 --> 07:22.359
and Detective Williams
is running forensics.

07:22.359 --> 07:23.819
We just reach out to her.

07:23.819 --> 07:26.572
If Cinda's DNA is on that knife,
it's game over!

07:26.572 --> 07:28.240
- Okay, I'm gonna text Detective Williams.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.158
- We find ourselves up against

07:30.158 --> 07:32.244
a <i>very</i> talented storyteller

07:32.244 --> 07:34.830
and a very mediocre cop.

07:34.830 --> 07:37.249
But how do we outwit them?

07:37.249 --> 07:38.709
- We need a confession.
- Uh-huh.

07:38.709 --> 07:41.336
- From Cinda Canning?
How do you propose we get that?

07:41.336 --> 07:43.881
- Torture? Can we torture her?

07:43.881 --> 07:46.008
Charles, get your concertina

07:46.008 --> 07:48.552
and whatever you consider
your 10 most interesting stories.

07:48.552 --> 07:50.596
- Hm, let me just muse on that,

07:50.596 --> 07:52.514
uh, for a second.
- Mm.

07:52.514 --> 07:54.391
- No! We need to unravel Cinda

07:54.391 --> 07:55.559
like a...

07:55.559 --> 07:57.394
uh, like, oh, jeez...

07:57.394 --> 07:58.812
What's a thing that unravels?

07:59.688 --> 08:01.565
- Uh...
- No, we just need to find the thing

08:01.565 --> 08:04.234
that unravels Cinda, so she slips up

08:04.234 --> 08:06.153
and reveals herself as the killer!

08:06.153 --> 08:07.696
- Oh, that's good.

08:07.696 --> 08:09.698
- And what's the one thing we know
drives Cinda crazy?

08:09.698 --> 08:12.117
- A sweater!
- A sweater drives Cinda crazy?

08:12.117 --> 08:14.536
- No, no, no. A sweater unravels, dear.
Try to keep up, really.

08:14.536 --> 08:16.121
- A mystery!

08:16.121 --> 08:19.541
- Poppy! Her assistant,
who drives her crazy.

08:19.541 --> 08:21.752
- No, that's the word I was looking for.
Unravels like a mystery.

08:21.752 --> 08:23.128
- Oh no, no, no. I like sweater best.

08:25.339 --> 08:27.716
- Have both of you had strokes or have I?

08:27.716 --> 08:28.926
- God!

08:28.926 --> 08:32.387
This is really not feeling
like a finale yet.

08:32.387 --> 08:33.639
Is it?

09:22.312 --> 09:24.314
<i>I have so many questions.</i>

09:24.314 --> 09:27.401
First off, do you prefer Becky or Poppy?

09:27.401 --> 09:29.403
Or would you prefer Boppy?

09:29.403 --> 09:32.155
Which has a certain <i>je ne sais quois.</i>
- I can't do this.

09:32.155 --> 09:33.782
- Oliver, what did we agree on?

09:33.782 --> 09:36.285
- You and Charles do the talking.

09:36.285 --> 09:38.704
- Okay. We know you work for Cinda.

09:38.704 --> 09:40.706
Mabel has explained how complicated that--

09:40.706 --> 09:41.874
- You can just cut to it.

09:43.083 --> 09:46.461
- How can we get Cinda
to crumble and cave like a...

09:47.045 --> 09:49.047
crumbling cave?

09:50.674 --> 09:53.343
- Excuse me?
- How do we get Cinda to confess?

09:53.343 --> 09:55.304
- She'd never.

09:55.304 --> 09:56.555
Are you serious?

09:56.555 --> 09:58.974
- You must know things that upset her,
that might make her feel vulnerable.

09:58.974 --> 10:02.269
- I mean, sure. Human error, interruption,

10:02.269 --> 10:04.104
people who work for her
but don't look like her.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.063
- Yeah, we noticed that one.

10:05.063 --> 10:07.107
- Mm-hmm.
- Are there things that disturb her,

10:07.107 --> 10:09.067
that might break down her defenses?

10:10.485 --> 10:13.906
- She does <i>not</i> like
the inside of a tomato?

10:14.907 --> 10:16.408
- Oh, I can see that.

10:16.867 --> 10:18.994
I'm terrified by tomatoes.

10:18.994 --> 10:21.038
And the inside of them?

10:21.038 --> 10:22.664
Just awful.

10:22.664 --> 10:25.083
- Okay, I guess that's something
we can work with.

10:25.083 --> 10:26.376
- Is it, though? What,

10:26.376 --> 10:28.795
are we gonna invite Cinda over
and make her a salad?

10:28.795 --> 10:30.756
- Oh! Oh, this one's weird.

10:30.756 --> 10:32.216
- The tomato was normal?

10:32.216 --> 10:34.551
- Um, she's very afraid of slow-motion.

10:35.552 --> 10:36.929
- I'm sorry?

10:36.929 --> 10:38.388
- I went to a Super Bowl party with Cinda,

10:38.388 --> 10:40.641
and every time
there was an instant replay, uh,

10:40.641 --> 10:44.061
I saw her shiver, and then start
to faint, and then cry a little bit.

10:44.061 --> 10:45.771
- Over the slow-motion?

10:45.771 --> 10:47.231
- Slow-motion, she does not like it.

10:47.231 --> 10:49.816
- Uh-huh.
- So, she's a <i>true</i> psychopath.

10:49.816 --> 10:52.361
- Hello. What can I get for you today?

10:53.820 --> 10:55.322
- Oh no, it's Cinda.

10:56.281 --> 10:57.908
The finale of <i>Only Murderers</i>

10:57.908 --> 11:00.118
is dropping tomorrow. Um...

11:00.118 --> 11:02.663
Can I get a liverwurst
and marmalade sandwich to go?

11:02.663 --> 11:03.914
Mm-hmm.

11:03.914 --> 11:05.666
- Hi, Cinda. I'm sorry.
I'm on my way back.

11:05.666 --> 11:07.251
There were train delays.

11:07.251 --> 11:09.962
- Oh my god!
- That's horrible.

11:09.962 --> 11:12.047
- Liverwurst and marmalade?
Is that a thing?

11:12.047 --> 11:15.133
- It's the owner's sister's
favorite sandwich.

11:16.552 --> 11:19.096
Bunny was so disgusted
we had it on the menu,

11:19.096 --> 11:20.305
she called it "freak food."

11:21.515 --> 11:23.851
- Well, hard agree
with Bun-Bun on that one.

11:23.851 --> 11:25.727
Hey, Ivan! Where's my toast?

11:25.727 --> 11:28.522
- Guys...
- English muffin, coming right up.

11:28.522 --> 11:31.108
- It's Detective Williams. Hang on.

11:32.109 --> 11:33.944
- Cinda's dropping the finale?

11:33.944 --> 11:35.904
Not hard to guess who
she's gonna name as the killer.

11:35.904 --> 11:38.699
- We're fucked.
We have got to put Cinda away today.

11:38.699 --> 11:41.743
- We need to rally our resources.
- Right. That's right.

11:42.786 --> 11:44.705
Hey, did Ivan ever take our order?

11:44.705 --> 11:46.623
- Oliver, we need a plan.
- I agree.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.125
We also need to eat.

11:50.627 --> 11:53.547
- What'd she say? Did Williams
get any info off that knife?

11:53.547 --> 11:55.507
- Yeah, she did.

11:55.507 --> 11:56.717
Guys...

11:57.301 --> 12:00.220
I think I know what "14 Savage" means.

12:04.516 --> 12:06.560
Why are we here?

12:06.560 --> 12:09.188
I'm organizing the estate sale,
but it's making me very sad.

12:09.188 --> 12:10.814
All her plants are dying, and

12:10.814 --> 12:13.609
why is that damn bird back?

12:13.609 --> 12:16.570
- That shady email just said,
"Be at Bunny's at 7:00

12:16.570 --> 12:18.280
"if you love good theater

12:18.280 --> 12:20.282
and/or want to be part of history."

12:20.282 --> 12:22.910
- I don't see cake.
The email said cake would be provided.

12:22.910 --> 12:24.119
Cheap fucks.

12:24.119 --> 12:26.622
- Am I dressed appropriately?

12:26.622 --> 12:28.373
It's really hard to know
what to wear to a...

12:28.373 --> 12:29.499
Killer Reveal Party.

12:29.499 --> 12:31.043
- Uh, "killer reveal party"

12:31.043 --> 12:33.128
meaning a party where
a killer is revealed,

12:33.128 --> 12:34.963
or a reveal party that's killer in nature?

12:34.963 --> 12:37.257
- I don't know, Jonathan.
Just be hot, okay?

12:37.257 --> 12:38.967
- Welcome, friends!
- Oh, here we go.

12:38.967 --> 12:41.261
To the show that's about to end.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.931
For we have figured out who extinguished

12:43.931 --> 12:47.267
the big, beautiful flame
of our beloved Bunny Folger.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.685
- Alright, so who did it?

12:48.685 --> 12:50.145
Who did it? Who did it?

12:50.145 --> 12:52.064
- I'm gonna strangle that bird.

12:52.064 --> 12:53.857
- You think we're just gonna tell you?

12:53.857 --> 12:56.985
- Kind of felt like that, yeah.
- Yeah. I mean, why else am I here?

12:56.985 --> 12:59.196
- Don't we kinda have to tell them
if they're gonna be part of it?

12:59.196 --> 13:01.323
- Must you poop on every party, Charles?

13:01.323 --> 13:03.534
Can't we have
a little dramatic tension here?

13:03.534 --> 13:05.953
- Oliver, she's gonna be here
in an hour. Just move it along.

13:05.953 --> 13:08.413
- Mabel, we can do this production <i>fast</i>,

13:08.413 --> 13:10.374
or we can do it well.
What would you prefer?

13:10.374 --> 13:11.416
- Fast. Do it fast.

13:11.416 --> 13:14.378
- Okay. Well, then I will not
take responsibility for the reviews.

13:14.378 --> 13:15.504
Alright. Okay.

13:15.504 --> 13:17.005
Uh, first question.

13:17.005 --> 13:19.883
Who here has had any theater training?

13:20.592 --> 13:22.803
- Well, I'm on Broadway right now.

13:22.803 --> 13:24.888
- Really?
- As a hyena.

13:24.888 --> 13:25.973
- Uh-huh...

13:26.723 --> 13:28.517
- And I once auditioned
for the part of Joseph

13:28.517 --> 13:30.769
in <i>Joseph and the Amazing
Technicolor Dreamcoat.</i>

13:30.769 --> 13:33.480
- The way you worded that makes
it sound like you didn't get it.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.857
- That is correct.

13:34.857 --> 13:36.900
But it has nothing to do with talent,

13:36.900 --> 13:38.277
despite what my mother said.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.571
- Uh, Lester?

13:40.571 --> 13:43.782
- Uh, just a little light stage stuff
when I was younger.

13:43.782 --> 13:44.825
- No shit!
- Yeah,

13:44.825 --> 13:48.579
I graduated from Juilliard.
Started out off-Broadway with Tracy Letts.

13:48.579 --> 13:50.831
We were rivals. Hand to God.
And what happened,

13:50.831 --> 13:52.040
if you don't mind me asking?

13:52.040 --> 13:54.668
- No, it's fine.
I just realized that my true passion

13:54.668 --> 13:57.296
was being a doorman,
and I left the theater behind.

13:57.296 --> 13:58.463
<i>- Really?</i>

13:58.463 --> 14:00.883
- Are you nuts? No.

14:00.883 --> 14:03.260
I stopped getting hired,
developed a drinking problem,

14:03.260 --> 14:04.928
and was homeless for a while.

14:04.928 --> 14:06.471
Almost died, cleaned up,

14:06.471 --> 14:07.806
took the first job I could get,

14:07.806 --> 14:09.933
and I've been stuck here ever since.

14:09.933 --> 14:12.019
- Jesus...
- How tragic!

14:12.019 --> 14:14.563
- Well, wasn't that a bummer?

14:14.563 --> 14:17.024
Anyway! You're all here today

14:17.024 --> 14:19.902
to play a part in
manipulating a mastermind

14:19.902 --> 14:21.904
into a live confession on our...

14:23.113 --> 14:25.115
cam show... Livestream.
- Livestream.

14:25.115 --> 14:26.992
- Where the hell is the fucking cake?

14:26.992 --> 14:28.744
- The cake is on its way!

14:28.744 --> 14:31.330
But this was very last minute,
and this is not about the cake.

14:31.330 --> 14:33.498
- Ah, they chintzed on the cake!

14:33.498 --> 14:34.791
I'm leaving.

14:34.791 --> 14:36.335
- Come on, Jonathan.
- Wait!

14:36.335 --> 14:37.878
This is about us right now!

14:37.878 --> 14:40.297
Bunny's fellow neighbors getting one shot

14:40.297 --> 14:42.216
to bring her killer to justice!

14:42.216 --> 14:44.134
- And we all really need your help.

14:46.803 --> 14:48.305
- Fine.

14:48.305 --> 14:51.642
But Bunny would have ordered
the cake from Sherman's on 92nd.

14:51.642 --> 14:52.476
- True.
- She sure would have.

14:52.476 --> 14:54.895
- Okay. We only have an hour.

14:54.895 --> 14:57.272
And if we pull this off,

14:57.272 --> 14:59.816
I swear to each
and every person in this room

14:59.816 --> 15:02.819
that Charles will buy you
the cake of your choice!

15:12.496 --> 15:13.997
- Okay. Here we go.

15:15.666 --> 15:17.501
- I'm missing
a parent-teacher conference for this,

15:17.501 --> 15:18.794
so your confession better be good.

15:18.794 --> 15:20.587
My kid's teacher is crazy hot.

15:20.587 --> 15:23.257
- Who said anything about a confession?

15:23.257 --> 15:25.926
- Well, you said you were gonna
reveal the murderer live,

15:25.926 --> 15:28.220
and <i>you're</i> the murderer.
So, by my math,

15:28.220 --> 15:30.430
that makes this a confession, Ms. Mora.

15:30.973 --> 15:32.683
- Are you really doing this?
- Mm-hmm.

15:33.725 --> 15:35.143
- What the hell is this?

15:39.106 --> 15:41.108
- It's a killer reveal party.

15:41.108 --> 15:44.152
- As in a party that <i>reveals</i> a killer,

15:44.152 --> 15:47.072
or a reveal party
that's going to be killer.

15:47.072 --> 15:49.157
- See? It is confusing.
- Shh...

15:49.157 --> 15:51.118
- It will all be explained.

15:51.118 --> 15:53.829
And Cinda, we have
our recording devices on,

15:53.829 --> 15:55.289
so you may want to turn on yours.

15:55.289 --> 15:57.583
- I have a girl for that. Poppy,
please start recording everything.

15:57.583 --> 15:59.793
- Would you like me to wire anyone
or just use the boom?

15:59.793 --> 16:02.087
- Uh, just record all
the smart things I say

16:02.087 --> 16:03.547
and all the dumb shit that they grunt.

16:03.547 --> 16:05.048
Oh my god!

16:06.633 --> 16:07.885
Okay, go ahead.

16:07.885 --> 16:10.429
- Welcome to our killer reveal party!

16:10.429 --> 16:12.806
Where we will reveal Bunny's killer.

16:12.806 --> 16:14.808
It's also a killer party, simultaneously.

16:14.808 --> 16:17.352
- Oh. Okay, so we were both right.

16:17.352 --> 16:18.729
- Double <i>entendre.</i>

16:18.729 --> 16:20.230
And it gives me no pleasure

16:20.230 --> 16:21.773
to inform you

16:21.773 --> 16:23.901
that the killer is here,

16:23.901 --> 16:25.402
in this very room.

16:25.402 --> 16:27.988
Oh! But that can't be! One of us?

16:27.988 --> 16:29.823
Please say it's not true!

16:29.823 --> 16:31.575
- Howard. Bring it down.

16:31.575 --> 16:33.911
- Let's remind ourselves of what we know.

16:33.911 --> 16:36.496
<i>Bunny had a very normal last day of life.</i>

16:36.496 --> 16:39.541
<i>She was contemplating a change.
A move, to Florida.</i>

16:39.541 --> 16:40.626
Fuck Florida!

16:40.626 --> 16:43.212
- The three of us saw her that very night.

16:43.212 --> 16:46.215
<i>She was looking for companionship.</i>

16:46.215 --> 16:47.466
<i>A friend.</i>

16:47.466 --> 16:49.176
But what did we do?
Bye-bye.

16:49.176 --> 16:50.594
<i>We rejected her.</i>

16:50.594 --> 16:52.012
We sent her away,

16:52.012 --> 16:53.388
back to her apartment.

16:53.388 --> 16:54.848
<i>Where someone was waiting for her.</i>

16:55.516 --> 16:58.352
<i>Someone who forced Bunny into my apartment</i>

16:58.352 --> 16:59.520
to frame me,

16:59.520 --> 17:01.438
then stabbed her with Oliver's knife

17:01.438 --> 17:03.232
and my knitting needle, then escaped

17:03.232 --> 17:05.859
<i>into the Arconia's secret passageways</i>

17:05.859 --> 17:07.069
<i>that they knew about,</i>

17:07.069 --> 17:09.905
then used those secret passageways

17:09.905 --> 17:12.241
to plant the murder weapon
in Charles' apartment,

17:12.241 --> 17:14.409
along with a very valuable painting

17:14.409 --> 17:17.788
of his nude father
they stole from Bunny's apartment...

17:17.788 --> 17:19.998
Jesus, is this what
we're really telling people?

17:19.998 --> 17:22.459
- It's a lot. We could have
tightened it up in rehearsal.

17:22.459 --> 17:25.587
- But who... had an interest in framing

17:25.587 --> 17:28.006
three... innocent... people?!

17:28.006 --> 17:29.883
You did!
- Me?!

17:29.883 --> 17:31.468
- Sorry! I got disoriented! You did!

17:32.010 --> 17:34.513
- Cinda Canning killed Bunny Folger.

17:35.556 --> 17:37.182
And how did she cover her tracks?

17:37.182 --> 17:40.853
With the help of a crooked cop
she met years ago in Oklahoma.

17:45.148 --> 17:46.692
- How did you know about Kreps?

17:46.692 --> 17:48.443
Are you kidding?

17:48.443 --> 17:51.905
The sexual energy
between you two was obvious.

17:52.489 --> 17:53.866
I'd say more,

17:53.866 --> 17:56.660
but this is
a <i>family</i> murder podcast.

17:56.660 --> 17:59.955
- Cinda Canning is not a great
podcaster who solves murders.

17:59.955 --> 18:03.584
She's a hack who makes
them up and packages them.

18:03.584 --> 18:05.919
And this time, she tried
to get away with a doozy.

18:06.879 --> 18:08.088
- Wow.

18:08.088 --> 18:10.340
Really enjoyed the spelling it all out.

18:10.340 --> 18:13.510
Very end of a <i>Scooby Doo</i> episode.
Very cute.

18:13.510 --> 18:14.970
One little problem, though.

18:14.970 --> 18:17.431
Why would I want to kill
an old woman I never met?

18:17.431 --> 18:19.683
- You met her, Ms. Canning.

18:19.683 --> 18:21.059
I have the logbooks.

18:21.059 --> 18:23.687
You were actually here a lot
before Bunny died, weren't you?

18:23.687 --> 18:26.440
- I was keeping tabs
on the Tim Kono investigation.

18:26.440 --> 18:28.150
- You killed her.

18:28.150 --> 18:30.944
You murdered her with a violent hand.

18:30.944 --> 18:34.198
You murdered a sweet old lady

18:34.198 --> 18:35.866
who...

18:35.866 --> 18:37.743
She was my friend!

18:37.743 --> 18:39.578
She was my only friend,

18:39.578 --> 18:40.829
and you took her!

18:40.829 --> 18:42.164
And why?!

18:42.164 --> 18:43.999
For a podcast?!

18:44.708 --> 18:45.751
Why?

18:47.085 --> 18:49.129
Why...

18:49.129 --> 18:50.756
- Oh, Jesus, he's wonderful.

18:55.719 --> 18:56.970
- Howard, no.

18:58.305 --> 19:00.724
- There is <i>literally</i> no motive here.

19:00.724 --> 19:02.851
Why would I have done any of this?

19:05.270 --> 19:07.731
<i>What...</i>

19:07.731 --> 19:09.608
<i>an...</i>

19:09.608 --> 19:12.528
<i>excellent...</i>

19:12.528 --> 19:15.072
<i>question...</i>

19:15.072 --> 19:18.325
OLIVER
<i>It... is...</i>

19:18.325 --> 19:21.912
<i>indeed...</i>

19:21.912 --> 19:24.164
- Why are you moving in slow-motion?

19:24.164 --> 19:26.792
- <i>Who's... going...</i>

19:26.792 --> 19:29.127
<i>slow?</i>

19:29.127 --> 19:30.754
- <i>Who... us?</i>

19:42.182 --> 19:44.351
- Stop it! Stop it! I-I'm leaving!

19:44.351 --> 19:45.644
- Alright, stop!

19:52.276 --> 19:53.527
- Oh god, what is that?

19:53.527 --> 19:55.863
- So, you sign a <i>big</i>, <i>juicy</i>

19:55.863 --> 19:58.407
$30 million podcast deal.

19:58.407 --> 19:59.616
Problem is,

19:59.616 --> 20:02.452
you don't have a juicy story to podcast.

20:02.452 --> 20:04.246
So, you go looking

20:04.246 --> 20:06.415
to invent one about a lonely

20:06.415 --> 20:08.083
old woman who gets murdered

20:08.083 --> 20:10.627
in a big... fancy...

20:10.627 --> 20:12.171
apartment building.
- No... No...

20:12.171 --> 20:13.547
- Honestly,

20:13.547 --> 20:15.549
not that great.

20:17.009 --> 20:19.386
Unless, the three people
who did the murdering

20:19.386 --> 20:22.514
are three A-list celebrities!

20:24.683 --> 20:26.935
- Oh. Sorry.

20:26.935 --> 20:28.437
I thought you were being funny.

20:28.437 --> 20:31.648
- Are we getting under your skin,
Ms. Canning?

20:31.648 --> 20:33.442
Admit you did it.

20:33.442 --> 20:35.944
Admit you did it!
Admit it! Admit it!

20:35.944 --> 20:38.405
- Forget it! And I'm not
confessing anything

20:38.405 --> 20:40.449
because... because...

20:40.449 --> 20:41.575
- Because why?!

20:41.575 --> 20:42.993
- Because she didn't do it.

20:45.537 --> 20:47.164
- Mabel, we're so close.
What are you doing?

20:47.164 --> 20:48.665
- I'm solving a murder.

20:50.125 --> 20:51.627
She did it.

20:52.878 --> 20:54.379
- Excuse me, what?

20:54.379 --> 20:56.381
- This is the work of an artist

20:57.090 --> 20:59.301
who just came into the picture recently.

20:59.301 --> 21:03.263
<i>Your gallery needed new energy.
Wasn't that what you said?</i>

21:03.263 --> 21:04.890
<i>Turns out, you were making art</i>

21:04.890 --> 21:06.517
from my tragedy.

21:06.517 --> 21:09.394
So why not frame me
and up the value of your art?

21:09.394 --> 21:12.648
Is this all part of the plan?
- I'm really not sure anymore.

21:12.648 --> 21:16.276
- I am outraged. And frankly,
haven't we been down this road before?

21:16.276 --> 21:17.236
- Sorry. Who is this person?

21:17.236 --> 21:19.321
And can we get her to dial
the accent down a little bit?

21:19.321 --> 21:21.782
I mean, if I can't understand a word,
how's Middle America gonna get it?

21:21.782 --> 21:23.700
You're a real charmer, Alice.

21:24.201 --> 21:25.994
And a hell of a kisser.

21:25.994 --> 21:27.829
Nice.

21:27.829 --> 21:29.456
- But you're also a liar.

21:31.458 --> 21:32.709
And a killer.

21:32.709 --> 21:34.169
- Huh.

21:34.169 --> 21:38.006
Bravo, Mabel. Bravo indeed.

21:38.006 --> 21:40.300
Here, all this time,
I was thinking you were just a bore

21:40.300 --> 21:42.427
with the drawing skills of a toddler.

21:42.427 --> 21:44.388
- It was you at the Pickle Diner,

21:44.388 --> 21:46.431
<i>begging Bunny for
her Rose Cooper painting.</i>

21:46.431 --> 21:48.934
But she wanted 14 million for it.

21:48.934 --> 21:50.894
"14 for Savage."

21:50.894 --> 21:53.063
That was a little out of
your price range, wasn't it?

21:54.857 --> 21:57.651
- You talentless, smug bitch.

21:57.651 --> 21:59.820
- Holy shit, she did it. She got her.

22:01.572 --> 22:03.073
- No!

22:09.830 --> 22:11.498
- Oh! Oh!

22:11.498 --> 22:13.917
Oh!
- Charles! Charles!

22:13.917 --> 22:15.335
- Get off me!
- Hold her down!

22:18.213 --> 22:20.465
Yes, 911? There's been a stabbing!

22:20.465 --> 22:23.468
Yes, at the Arconia! Yes, he's bleeding!

22:23.468 --> 22:27.264
- Charles? Charles!
- Charles! Oh my... Oh jeez...

22:27.264 --> 22:30.184
You're okay, buddy. You're okay.

22:34.521 --> 22:36.106
Oh!

22:36.106 --> 22:39.026
Oh...

22:39.026 --> 22:40.485
Charles...

22:43.739 --> 22:45.365
- Jesus Christ.

22:45.365 --> 22:47.659
Please tell me you got all that.

22:56.502 --> 22:58.587
Unhand me!

22:58.587 --> 23:00.547
It's okay, Mrs. Gambolini.

23:00.547 --> 23:02.549
Don't be scared. Don't be scared.

23:03.634 --> 23:05.219
This bird has seen too much, Jonathan.

23:05.219 --> 23:07.221
- Police and ambulance
are three minutes out.

23:12.309 --> 23:14.019
I'm so sorry, Mabel.

23:14.019 --> 23:15.687
For all of it.

23:15.687 --> 23:17.648
You poor kid.

23:17.648 --> 23:19.483
But what you just did...

23:21.485 --> 23:22.861
I mean...

23:22.861 --> 23:25.322
Shit, you were incredible.

23:25.322 --> 23:28.033
You are one hell of an investigator.

23:28.033 --> 23:30.118
I could use someone like you on my staff.

23:31.119 --> 23:32.621
I mean, hell, I...

23:33.372 --> 23:35.874
I think you could have your <i>own</i> podcast.

23:35.874 --> 23:37.876
- Oh, don't even. Don't you <i>even</i>...

23:37.876 --> 23:40.337
- Poppy?

23:40.796 --> 23:43.340
- What...

23:44.508 --> 23:45.759
This was pure luck!

23:45.759 --> 23:47.845
Th-there is absolutely nothing

23:47.845 --> 23:50.430
that ties this Australian girl
to Bunny's murder.

23:50.430 --> 23:51.473
Nothing.

23:51.473 --> 23:52.641
- I'm English, you twat.

23:52.641 --> 23:54.017
- Achoo!

23:54.017 --> 23:56.144
- Bless you.
- Thank you.

23:57.813 --> 23:59.815
Why does Mabel get a podcast?

24:00.941 --> 24:02.401
Because she's pretty?

24:03.110 --> 24:06.113
Because she boldly dated
the supposed killer?

24:07.281 --> 24:09.116
I do everything for you.

24:09.575 --> 24:13.245
I get your lunch,
and I respond to all your mail,

24:13.245 --> 24:16.415
and I pick up your dry cleaning,
and I drop off your dry cleaning,

24:16.415 --> 24:18.792
and I pick up your dry cleaning,
and I drop off your dry cleaning, and--

24:18.792 --> 24:21.044
Why don't you just wear
something that you can wash?!

24:22.296 --> 24:24.673
And I told you about the Rose Cooper art,

24:24.673 --> 24:27.134
and you made a flying fart joke.

24:27.134 --> 24:28.302
I told you all--

24:28.302 --> 24:29.636
Achoo!
Okay, Poppy,

24:29.636 --> 24:31.930
you know my rule.
Two sneezes in my presence means

24:31.930 --> 24:33.599
you need to self-quarantine for a week.

24:33.599 --> 24:35.350
Poppy?

24:35.350 --> 24:37.102
Why'd you tell Cinda about Rose Cooper?

24:38.145 --> 24:40.314
- It was an idea for a podcast.

24:40.314 --> 24:42.482
Cinda was not interested...

24:42.482 --> 24:44.401
- But you were,

24:44.401 --> 24:46.737
and in that painting that Bunny owned.

24:46.737 --> 24:47.946
- Achoo!

24:47.946 --> 24:50.240
- Do you have some kind of allergy?

24:51.033 --> 24:53.285
To Mrs. Gambolini perchance?

24:53.285 --> 24:54.286
- Achoo!

24:55.662 --> 24:57.414
- It's so strange.

24:57.414 --> 25:00.375
The killer sneezed
when fleeing the crime scene.

25:03.003 --> 25:06.590
- It's not a crime to be allergic
to rancid bird molting.

25:07.466 --> 25:09.635
And what? You're gonna believe
some-- some young girl

25:09.635 --> 25:12.387
that's hiding in your walls?

25:13.680 --> 25:17.100
- Only the killer could have known there
was a girl hiding in the walls that night.

25:17.100 --> 25:19.019
- And her name is Lucy.

25:19.811 --> 25:21.146
And yours...

25:21.146 --> 25:23.023
is Becky.

25:24.483 --> 25:25.734
- Who told you that?

25:25.734 --> 25:26.527
We did.

25:32.950 --> 25:35.285
I wasn't stabbed.

25:35.285 --> 25:37.538
It's all theater.

25:37.538 --> 25:39.456
- We've been onto you
since this afternoon!

25:39.456 --> 25:40.499
- We all have.

25:42.042 --> 25:45.462
- I don't understand what's happening!
- It's over, kiddo.

25:45.462 --> 25:47.881
I know the game you played
with me in Oklahoma,

25:47.881 --> 25:49.591
and they know the game
you played with them

25:49.591 --> 25:51.927
in this overpriced building.

25:51.927 --> 25:53.303
- And I only real fainted once.

25:53.303 --> 25:55.722
The other times were acting.

25:59.560 --> 26:01.812
- I just wanted to make a good podcast.

26:03.063 --> 26:05.566
I just wanted Cinda to notice me.

26:05.566 --> 26:08.026
But things went wrong
right from the start.

26:08.026 --> 26:10.571
Right from that night that I texted you

26:10.571 --> 26:13.907
to get out of the building,
and you came back to your apartment.

26:20.497 --> 26:22.249
How'd you figure it out?

26:25.878 --> 26:28.547
- It's Detective Williams. Hang on.

26:30.757 --> 26:31.717
Hey.
<i>Hey.</i>

26:31.717 --> 26:34.344
<i>So I got DNA off
the murder weapon. Saliva.</i>

26:34.344 --> 26:35.971
But get this.

26:35.971 --> 26:37.890
<i>It belongs to a dead girl</i>

26:37.890 --> 26:39.433
from way the hell out of state.

26:39.433 --> 26:41.268
- Let me guess.

26:41.268 --> 26:42.269
Oklahoma.

26:44.396 --> 26:46.607
- How the hell did you know that?

26:46.607 --> 26:48.400
- I think I know what "14 Savage" means.

26:55.741 --> 26:57.993
- Sandwich...

26:57.993 --> 27:00.746
14 sandwich?
Liverwurst and marmalade to go.

27:00.746 --> 27:02.080
- That's me.

27:08.962 --> 27:10.631
- The thing is,

27:10.631 --> 27:13.634
before I became one of the most
talked about people in the country...

27:15.219 --> 27:16.887
I had a pretty ordinary life.

27:19.890 --> 27:21.850
<i>Ordinary, that is, if you assume</i>

27:21.850 --> 27:25.020
<i>most ordinary people are pretty miserable.</i>

27:26.313 --> 27:28.315
<i>Which I assume is
a pretty safe assumption.</i>

27:57.594 --> 27:59.137
<i>Once Becky Butler found the way</i>

27:59.137 --> 28:01.849
<i>to use her own story to get a job</i>

28:01.849 --> 28:03.767
<i>with her hero, Cinda Canning...</i>

28:03.767 --> 28:05.519
- Uh, what exactly do <i>you</i> want?

28:05.519 --> 28:06.979
- I would like a job, Ms. Canning.

28:06.979 --> 28:08.730
<i>...she thought she'd be home free.</i>

28:09.606 --> 28:12.568
<i>She even found someone
that was willing to help her.</i>

28:12.568 --> 28:16.238
<i>Though, at first,
like so many things that go bad,</i>

28:16.238 --> 28:17.739
<i>it was just about love.</i>

28:18.699 --> 28:20.784
<i>So she went the extra mile</i>

28:20.784 --> 28:24.621
<i>and plotted a bigger New York story.</i>

28:24.621 --> 28:28.375
- Yes, you can. She's old. And mean.

28:28.375 --> 28:30.878
You deserve this. We both do.

28:30.878 --> 28:34.214
You get to be famous, I get a promotion,

28:34.214 --> 28:37.467
and we get to move out
of this sweaty shit-box. Yes.

28:38.051 --> 28:40.888
You got this.
- I deserve it. I deserve it.

28:41.972 --> 28:44.224
Ooh! Did I tell you about
the secret passageways I found?

28:44.224 --> 28:46.435
What? Fuck, I fuckin' love you.

28:46.435 --> 28:49.771
- And with that, another mystery solved.

28:49.771 --> 28:51.607
So one last time,

28:51.607 --> 28:53.525
for <i>Only Murders in the Building</i>...

28:53.525 --> 28:56.737
- And for
<i>Only Murderers in the Building...</i>

28:56.737 --> 28:58.864
- I'm Oliver Putnam.

28:58.864 --> 29:00.449
- I'm Mabel Mora.

29:00.449 --> 29:03.285
And I'm Charles-Haden Savage.

29:03.285 --> 29:05.829
- And Cinda Canning.
Thanks again to our sponsor

29:05.829 --> 29:08.457
Gut Milk Lite.
It's got all the flavor of Gut Milk

29:08.457 --> 29:10.792
and none of the unexplained crunch.

29:10.792 --> 29:13.212
- Wow.

29:13.212 --> 29:15.380
Two murders back-to-back.
- Yep.

29:15.380 --> 29:17.549
- Now we can start talking
to each other like people

29:17.549 --> 29:19.927
and not just about murders.
- Right.

29:30.938 --> 29:32.940
- Ah. Thank you.

29:35.442 --> 29:37.819
- Okay, where's the wheelchair?
- Didn't you read the stage directions?

29:38.529 --> 29:40.447
- No, I have one line.
- Charles,

29:40.447 --> 29:42.241
your test scores are off the charts!

29:42.241 --> 29:44.952
The network wants you out
of the wheelchair immediately,

29:44.952 --> 29:47.204
and your dementia is in remish.

29:47.204 --> 29:50.457
- Hallelujah! It's a miracle cure!

29:50.457 --> 29:52.376
- Nice. You got de-dementia'd.

29:52.376 --> 29:55.629
- Thanks, Luce.
- Last looks!

29:55.629 --> 29:57.506
- Oop.

29:57.506 --> 29:59.383
- Well, welcome back

29:59.383 --> 30:01.802
to the world of the upright.
- Thanks, Joy.

30:01.802 --> 30:03.220
- Hm.

30:03.220 --> 30:04.680
Looking good, Charlie.

30:06.431 --> 30:08.141
- Hey, Joy.
- Yeah?

30:09.893 --> 30:10.936
- Uh...

30:15.440 --> 30:17.860
- Are you asking me out on a date?

30:20.153 --> 30:21.196
For when?

30:23.574 --> 30:24.908
Are you suggesting tonight?

30:25.659 --> 30:26.660
Yes.

30:28.412 --> 30:29.955
- Oh, Charlie.

30:29.955 --> 30:31.748
Finally, you got it out.

30:37.671 --> 30:38.922
Jesus. God.

30:46.722 --> 30:49.892
- You're doing it.
You're actually renovating.

30:49.892 --> 30:52.269
- Well, it <i>is</i> about time.

30:53.270 --> 30:55.898
- And does this become integrated
into a new design?

30:55.898 --> 30:57.608
And do I?

30:57.608 --> 31:00.736
- Uh, no. But,

31:00.736 --> 31:02.946
you could grab a roller and help, please.

31:15.375 --> 31:16.793
- Hey!

31:18.212 --> 31:20.005
- Hey!
- Hey, girl.

31:20.964 --> 31:24.426
- Look at you. Fresh from his triumph
in the land of witches and munchkins.

31:24.426 --> 31:27.596
- Uh, triumph, I don't know
about that, but we survived.

31:27.596 --> 31:30.933
- Yeah.
- Now, um, where is...

31:30.933 --> 31:32.726
W-what are you calling her now?

31:32.726 --> 31:35.729
- Oh, Mama G! Yes, yes, yes.
She's, uh, right here.

31:35.729 --> 31:38.232
She's just looking a little piqued to me.

31:38.232 --> 31:40.108
- Alright. Let's take a look.

31:40.108 --> 31:42.945
- Winnie noticed it first.
- So you decided to keep her, huh?

31:42.945 --> 31:45.739
- Well, I just... Winnie's grown
awfully attached, so...

31:49.952 --> 31:52.162
Willie, th-there's something...

31:52.162 --> 31:53.455
I-I need to tell you.

31:53.455 --> 31:55.165
S-something I...

31:56.166 --> 31:59.294
haven't been honest about. Uh...

31:59.294 --> 32:00.546
- Dad.

32:02.506 --> 32:05.008
If you're not my father,
then I don't know what a father is.

32:06.343 --> 32:07.386
You hear me?

32:12.599 --> 32:15.143
- How did you know?
- Come on.

32:15.143 --> 32:16.562
I know all your tells.

32:21.400 --> 32:23.110
- I love you so much.

32:27.114 --> 32:28.198
- You gonna get that?

32:28.198 --> 32:30.492
- No, no, no, not now.

32:33.203 --> 32:34.955
- Who are we kidding?
J-just take the call.

32:34.955 --> 32:36.582
- Well, I guess... You know,

32:36.582 --> 32:38.584
just to get it out of the way.
You never know.

32:39.543 --> 32:42.588
Oh, it's Donna. Producer friend of mine.

32:42.588 --> 32:44.673
Hey, Donna.

32:44.673 --> 32:47.676
To what do I owe this...

32:47.676 --> 32:51.054
No, I know. I actually <i>do</i> owe you
a lot of money, but is that...

32:51.054 --> 32:52.556
Is that why you're calling?

32:55.058 --> 32:57.644
Oh, really?

32:57.644 --> 32:59.646
What, did the director
fall out or something?

33:01.899 --> 33:03.400
Broadway?

33:05.569 --> 33:07.779
It opens in a year. Well, yes.

33:07.779 --> 33:10.115
I-I think I-I would be perfect for that.

33:10.115 --> 33:11.950
And who's the star?

33:13.827 --> 33:15.287
Really?!

33:15.287 --> 33:17.456
Ben?

33:17.456 --> 33:19.458
Everyone gets opening night jitters!

33:19.458 --> 33:21.168
I can talk you through it!

33:23.420 --> 33:24.463
- I'm good.

33:28.467 --> 33:30.344
Alright...

33:30.344 --> 33:33.305
- Hey, look, I'm good, okay?
I'm gonna rock this place.

33:33.305 --> 33:35.641
It's the other guy
you need to talk to. Fuckbag.

33:35.641 --> 33:38.060
- No, no. So, okay,
so I did talk to him, and--

33:38.060 --> 33:39.186
- Uh-huh. Did he apologize?

33:39.937 --> 33:42.147
- Well, you know,
a lot has gone on, but...

33:43.315 --> 33:45.025
Look, this is what I suggest.

33:45.025 --> 33:47.110
Use it, okay?

33:47.110 --> 33:51.073
Let the tension seep in between
you two tonight as a color.

33:51.073 --> 33:53.158
- Okay, so, like, then I can kill him?

33:53.158 --> 33:55.327
Because I just might, Oliver.
I'm warning you.

33:55.327 --> 33:57.371
- No, see, now,
that is an interesting color.

33:57.371 --> 34:00.624
- Places! Break a leg, Ben.

34:00.624 --> 34:02.042
- That's a pretty good option, too.

34:02.042 --> 34:05.212
- Oh. Well, anyway.
Okay, so I just--

34:05.212 --> 34:07.172
Fun out there...

34:16.098 --> 34:17.140
- Ah...

34:26.942 --> 34:27.985
- Good luck tonight.

34:28.527 --> 34:30.696
- Huh. Thanks.

34:30.696 --> 34:32.781
- "Good luck" is a curse
in the theater.

34:34.616 --> 34:36.201
- I know that.

34:36.201 --> 34:38.078
- What, y-you don't think I know that?

34:38.078 --> 34:39.621
I just didn't mention it

34:39.621 --> 34:41.540
to be polite to you, you piece of shit.

34:41.540 --> 34:43.876
- Hey. Hey.

34:43.876 --> 34:47.129
We got two and a half hours to get
through. If I can do it, you can, too.

34:47.129 --> 34:50.090
- I'm the pro here. Alright,
you don't have to worry about me.

34:53.302 --> 34:55.220
- Be smart.

34:55.220 --> 34:57.222
Stay away from her.

34:59.057 --> 35:00.851
- Why?

35:00.851 --> 35:03.228
What are you gonna do?
- Ben...

35:04.229 --> 35:06.732
I know what you did.

35:25.667 --> 35:27.044
- Hey, girl.
- Oh.

35:27.669 --> 35:30.005
I can't believe this.
- Right? What a year, huh?

35:30.005 --> 35:31.465
- Yeah. Well,

35:31.465 --> 35:33.967
any year without a murder
is a good one in my book.

35:35.052 --> 35:37.012
- Okay. Fasten your seat belts.

35:37.012 --> 35:39.139
Hey, honey.

35:39.139 --> 35:41.642
- So proud of you.
- Thank you, thank you, thank you...

35:55.572 --> 35:58.575
- What turned me
into a creature of the night.

36:01.870 --> 36:03.372
Let me tell you.

36:17.886 --> 36:19.513
A cre--

36:26.311 --> 36:28.105
Let me t-- Ooh...

36:28.105 --> 36:30.148
Help me...

36:32.150 --> 36:34.278
- Somebody! Anybody!

36:38.407 --> 36:39.908
- He's not moving!

36:51.879 --> 36:54.506
- You've gotta be fucking kidding me.
