WEBVTT

00:04.971 --> 00:07.006
It's freezing out here.

00:07.008 --> 00:08.140
I don't even know why

00:08.142 --> 00:10.442
Osama bin Laden was
at Jesus' birthday.

00:10.444 --> 00:12.344
You're a wise
man, dummy.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.146
Freeze. Here
comes a car!

00:14.148 --> 00:16.115
MAN:
Jesus was white!

00:16.117 --> 00:17.249
Ow!

00:17.251 --> 00:20.252
I'm starting to think
only jerks drive Camaros.

00:20.254 --> 00:21.920
Cleveland, my buzz
is wearing off,

00:21.922 --> 00:24.523
and now I don't know why
I agreed to this.

00:24.525 --> 00:25.758
We're going inside.

00:25.760 --> 00:26.959
Wait!

00:26.961 --> 00:28.694
Let us pass our
mangering time

00:28.696 --> 00:30.929
with a wonderful
Christmas story.

00:30.931 --> 00:32.197
Oh, Lord.

00:32.199 --> 00:35.100
This best not start with,
"The year was 1988."

00:35.102 --> 00:37.169
The year was 1988...

00:38.004 --> 00:39.638
♪

00:39.640 --> 00:41.707
(gunshots)

00:43.043 --> 00:45.110
(tires screeching)

00:46.046 --> 00:49.348
(thudding)

00:50.283 --> 00:52.351
(tires squeak)

00:55.121 --> 00:57.089
What's wrong,
fellow traveler?

00:57.091 --> 00:58.957
You look nervous.

00:58.959 --> 01:00.859
This is our first parody.

01:00.861 --> 01:02.194
Ah.

01:02.196 --> 01:04.963
You want to know the
secret to a good parody?

01:04.965 --> 01:06.765
When you get to
your destination,

01:06.767 --> 01:09.134
take off your
shoes and socks

01:09.136 --> 01:11.537
and make fists
with your toes.

01:11.539 --> 01:12.438
Okay.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.106
Now, you can help me.

01:14.108 --> 01:16.708
Am I allowed to
call it a sandwich

01:16.710 --> 01:19.378
if I eat three pieces of
bread stacked together?

01:19.380 --> 01:21.313
You talking
about a bread sandwich?!

01:21.315 --> 01:23.282
(chuckles)
I suppose I am.

01:23.284 --> 01:24.316
Yeah, man, little mayo...

01:24.318 --> 01:26.985
(bell dings, crowd chatter)

01:28.188 --> 01:30.289
It's okay.
I'm not a cop.

01:30.291 --> 01:33.025
And if you went to the bathroom
one more time,

01:33.027 --> 01:34.126
I was gonna shoot you.

01:34.128 --> 01:37.262
I have a too-small
colostomy bag.

01:37.264 --> 01:39.331
That's nasty.

01:40.300 --> 01:41.633
(men laughing giddily)

01:41.635 --> 01:43.102
Ah! I've
missed you <i>so.</i>

01:43.104 --> 01:44.303
<i>Oh.</i>

01:44.305 --> 01:45.671
I <i>know.</i>

01:45.673 --> 01:47.439
Hmm. California.

01:47.441 --> 01:48.774
RALLO:
You Brown?

01:48.776 --> 01:50.042
I'm Rallo.

01:50.044 --> 01:51.443
People call me Argyle.

01:51.445 --> 01:54.113
Aren't you a little young
to be a limo driver?

01:54.115 --> 01:56.548
Aren't you a little old
to be an action hero?

01:56.550 --> 01:58.717
Ha. Good banter.

02:00.353 --> 02:02.988
So my wife got
this great job out here

02:02.990 --> 02:04.957
with Waterman International.

02:04.959 --> 02:07.526
(whistles)

02:07.528 --> 02:09.294
She must make
more than you.

02:09.296 --> 02:12.264
Mm-hmm. That's what we've been
fighting on account of.

02:12.266 --> 02:13.832
Have mercy.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.834
Although I do take some comfort

02:15.836 --> 02:17.469
in knowing she still makes less

02:17.471 --> 02:19.938
than a man would
for doing the same job.

02:19.940 --> 02:22.040
(laughs)

02:22.042 --> 02:23.976
I think tonight's
Christmas party

02:23.978 --> 02:26.345
might be my chance
to make it up to her.

02:26.347 --> 02:28.447
Lord gonna set
it straight.

02:28.449 --> 02:30.582
Are you even listening
to anything I'm saying?

02:30.584 --> 02:32.584
(whistles)

02:32.586 --> 02:34.553
Have mercy.

02:41.461 --> 02:43.529
(classical music plays,
crowd chatter)

02:45.265 --> 02:47.332
(elevatorbell dings)

02:49.002 --> 02:50.936
You must be Cleveland.

02:50.938 --> 02:52.971
You're gonna die.

02:52.973 --> 02:56.041
(tires squealing)

02:56.043 --> 02:58.110
(whoosh)

03:01.814 --> 03:03.048
(thudding)

03:03.050 --> 03:05.083
I've fallen,
and I can't get up.

03:05.085 --> 03:06.618
(laughter)

03:06.620 --> 03:08.453
Ha! Like that old
lady in the commercial

03:08.455 --> 03:10.622
that we all just saw
for the first time

03:10.624 --> 03:11.957
because it's 1988!

03:11.959 --> 03:12.991
(chuckles)

03:12.993 --> 03:15.294
That reference
will never get old.

03:15.296 --> 03:18.664
Come on, terrorists and guy
who looks like Huey Lewis.

03:18.666 --> 03:20.299
Let's take over this building.

03:20.301 --> 03:24.803
Dudes, I really have fallen,
and I can't get up.

03:24.805 --> 03:26.972
Boy, that joke
got old quick.

03:26.974 --> 03:27.973
Holt.

03:27.975 --> 03:30.008
Hold on. I'm almost finished.

03:30.010 --> 03:32.077
(loud snorting)

03:34.013 --> 03:36.081
(snorting continues)

03:41.921 --> 03:43.922
(shouts gibberish)

03:43.924 --> 03:46.491
This is Cleveland Brown,
Donna's husband.

03:46.493 --> 03:47.993
Hi.

03:47.995 --> 03:49.194
You're also
gonna die.

03:49.196 --> 03:50.429
Yeah!

03:50.431 --> 03:51.930
Hey, bud,
you want a line?

03:51.932 --> 03:53.465
It's something new
called cocaine.

03:53.467 --> 03:54.666
DONNA:
Cleveland,

03:54.668 --> 03:56.101
you made it!

03:56.103 --> 03:58.537
Let's give Miss Tubbs
some privacy.

03:58.539 --> 04:00.806
Tubbs. Crockett.
Sprockets.

04:00.808 --> 04:01.974
(with German accent):
Now we dance.

04:01.976 --> 04:03.175
Oops, '90s.

04:03.177 --> 04:04.943
I'm so high right now.

04:04.945 --> 04:05.978
Drip!

04:05.980 --> 04:08.013
Why aren't you using
my last name?

04:08.015 --> 04:10.249
No one likes working with
a married woman, Cleveland.

04:10.251 --> 04:11.850
No one.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.452
I'm just glad
you're here now.

04:13.454 --> 04:14.820
One sec.

04:14.822 --> 04:17.022
Some stranger told me
to take my shoes off.

04:17.024 --> 04:18.857
Do you mind?

04:18.859 --> 04:20.993
I've been doing
a lot of thinking

04:20.995 --> 04:23.662
since we've been apart,
and I realized,

04:23.664 --> 04:28.100
all I want for Christmas
is my two front us.

04:28.102 --> 04:29.134
Cleveland!

04:29.136 --> 04:31.803
Shh, shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh.

04:31.805 --> 04:35.774
Look, we're under
the mistletoe.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.843
Cleveland, you haven't
changed a bit.

04:38.845 --> 04:40.912
(crowd chatter,
elevator bell dings)

04:44.784 --> 04:46.285
(screams and yells)
Hi. We're
the bad guys.

04:46.287 --> 04:50.088
Uh, tell me, which one of
you is CEO Lloyd Waterman?

04:52.625 --> 04:54.693
I'm Lloyd
Waterman.

04:59.365 --> 05:00.399
Bitch.

05:02.101 --> 05:03.335
Hmm.

05:03.337 --> 05:05.270
I bet I could.

05:05.272 --> 05:07.139
(cooing)

05:07.141 --> 05:08.340
Hee-hee!

05:08.342 --> 05:09.975
Aw, now I ain't got no shoes.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.977
(rapid gunfire,
screams, man yelling)

05:11.979 --> 05:14.146
COOKIE:
Oh, God, terrorists!

05:14.148 --> 05:15.947
Terrorists? Oh, no!

05:15.949 --> 05:18.383
<i>Aah!</i>

05:20.653 --> 05:23.088
MR. WATERMAN:
There's no way

05:23.090 --> 05:24.923
I'm giving you the
codes to the vault.

05:24.925 --> 05:27.959
And I don't care what
unspeakable things

05:27.961 --> 05:30.562
this brawny beefcake
does to my body!

05:35.435 --> 05:39.271
Mr. Waterman, I'm going
to, uh, <i>count</i> to three.

05:39.273 --> 05:41.206
(like The Count
on   <i>Sesam</i>Street):
One. Ha-ha-ha.

05:41.208 --> 05:43.275
Two. Ha-ha-ha.

05:43.277 --> 05:44.309
Three.

05:44.311 --> 05:45.510
(thudding)
Oh.

05:45.512 --> 05:46.978
CLEVELAND:
Not the kind of shot

05:46.980 --> 05:48.980
in the face he wanted.

05:48.982 --> 05:49.948
What was that?

05:49.950 --> 05:51.149
CLEVELAND:
Ice machine.

05:51.151 --> 05:54.686
Kendra, go check out that
wisecracking ice machine.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.922
I hope it's next
to a vending machine,

05:56.924 --> 05:58.256
'cause I'm...

05:58.258 --> 06:00.759
(high-pitched):
huge!

06:00.761 --> 06:02.561
(wheelchair whirring)

06:04.831 --> 06:06.932
(power saw revving)

06:09.135 --> 06:11.103
(blade clinking)

06:11.105 --> 06:12.938
Ice to meet you!

06:12.940 --> 06:15.040
Yah!

06:15.042 --> 06:18.043
(grunting)

06:20.113 --> 06:22.981
(Kendra yelping,
Cleveland grunting)

06:22.983 --> 06:24.416
(neck snapping)

06:24.418 --> 06:26.251
(bones clicking)

06:26.253 --> 06:29.421
I never <i>was</i> an
ice machine.

06:29.423 --> 06:30.655
(thudding)

06:30.657 --> 06:31.990
Guys, since it looks like

06:31.992 --> 06:34.025
we're not going anywhere
for a while,

06:34.027 --> 06:36.428
we might as well have
our Christmas gift exchange.

06:36.430 --> 06:38.029
Who's got number one?

06:38.031 --> 06:41.600
I have number one, but
I got to go number two,

06:41.602 --> 06:42.801
'cause I'm...

06:42.803 --> 06:44.002
(farts)

06:44.004 --> 06:45.771
...outrageous!

06:45.773 --> 06:47.439
(laughter)

06:47.441 --> 06:49.040
Hmm. Cutty Sark.

06:49.042 --> 06:51.109
This alcohol's gonna give me
loose lips,

06:51.111 --> 06:53.945
and y'all know they ain't
too tight to start with.

06:53.947 --> 06:55.213
(farts)

06:55.215 --> 06:58.016
I'm outrageous!

06:58.018 --> 06:58.984
(elevator bell dings)

06:58.986 --> 07:01.052
(gasps)
Kendra!

07:03.689 --> 07:06.825
I guess she's eating
in a better place now.

07:06.827 --> 07:08.994
Bye, Fatso.

07:08.996 --> 07:10.629
CLEVELAND (over radio):
Mayday! Mayday!

07:10.631 --> 07:12.664
Bad guys have taken over
the Waterman tower!

07:12.666 --> 07:14.666
They're foreign, but not Arab,

07:14.668 --> 07:17.269
because they're not
the go-to bad guys yet.

07:17.271 --> 07:18.003
(rapid gunfire)

07:18.005 --> 07:20.038
That sounds serious.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.707
I'll put in a call to
a cop who shot a kid.

07:22.709 --> 07:24.376
Junior, this is the hot girl

07:24.378 --> 07:26.211
who shouldn't be stuck
in dispatch.

07:26.213 --> 07:28.980
We need you to investigate
possible gunfire

07:28.982 --> 07:30.148
at the Waterman Building.

07:30.150 --> 07:31.650
Okay.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.452
♪ Twinkie, Twinkie,
little snack ♪

07:33.454 --> 07:36.154
♪ Wonder how you'd taste
with cheese. ♪

07:36.156 --> 07:37.422
Mmm.

07:39.926 --> 07:41.526
(rapid gunfire continues)

07:43.629 --> 07:45.630
(bullets ricocheting)

07:45.632 --> 07:49.034
Oh, my God, I'm the first
rapper to get shot!

07:49.036 --> 07:51.236
I bet this becomes a thing.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.941
(bullets ricocheting,
rapid gunfire continues)

08:05.985 --> 08:10.422
"This strap can hold up
to 200 pounds."

08:10.424 --> 08:12.491
I'll be fine then.

08:14.861 --> 08:16.461
(strap snapping, yelling)

08:16.463 --> 08:19.164
I'm fatter than I said!

08:22.134 --> 08:24.135
Phew!

08:24.137 --> 08:26.137
Finger curls paying off.

(grunting)

08:30.109 --> 08:32.177
(brakes squeak)

08:34.180 --> 08:37.482
Excuse me, guy who
looks like Huey Lewis,

08:37.484 --> 08:39.918
but are there terrorists
shooting guns here?

08:39.920 --> 08:41.953
No, no one's here at all.

08:41.955 --> 08:45.123
As a cop on Christmas,
that's all I need to hear.

08:45.125 --> 08:47.325
I shot a kid.

08:48.361 --> 08:49.995
Where are you going?!

08:49.997 --> 08:52.998
Oh, I've got
to get his attention.

08:53.766 --> 08:55.834
(sighs)

08:58.137 --> 09:00.138
Sorry. Sorry.

09:00.140 --> 09:01.806
(screams)

09:01.808 --> 09:03.375

09:05.878 --> 09:07.379
(whimpering)

09:07.381 --> 09:09.614
(yelling, tires squealing)

09:09.616 --> 09:10.849
Oh!

09:10.851 --> 09:14.019
Welcome to the party over here,
pal!

09:20.192 --> 09:22.460
CLEVELAND:
Hello? Bad guys?

09:22.462 --> 09:24.863
Oh, the mystery man.

09:24.865 --> 09:26.298
So, who are you?

09:26.300 --> 09:27.799
Just another American

09:27.801 --> 09:30.468
who watched too many
TV mysteries as a child?

09:30.470 --> 09:32.003
Who do you think you are?

09:32.005 --> 09:34.773
Magnum P.U.
or MacMillan and Loaf,

09:34.775 --> 09:37.642
or Murder She Float,
or Simon and Semen?

09:37.644 --> 09:41.780
I've always been partial
to cartoon dogs.

09:41.782 --> 09:45.450
Scooby Dooby Doo, (beep).

09:45.452 --> 09:47.452
I'm sorry, we
didn't catch that.

09:47.454 --> 09:49.788
There was a long beep at the end
of your sentence.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.623
Where are you,
so we can come kill you?

09:51.625 --> 09:52.924
I'll never tell.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.092
Bye-bye.

09:54.094 --> 09:56.094
All right, where am I?

09:56.096 --> 09:57.829
Ah, 34th floor.

09:57.831 --> 09:59.431
Northeast corner.

09:59.433 --> 10:01.333
Under the exit sign.

10:01.335 --> 10:03.835
12 paces to the left
of the elevator.

10:03.837 --> 10:05.303

10:25.926 --> 10:27.792
I'm in!

10:27.794 --> 10:30.662

more perspective?

You crazy?!

19:37.143 --> 19:38.943

19:38.945 --> 19:40.311
We'll get another one

19:40.313 --> 19:43.147

like a Oompa Loompa!

19:59.966 --> 20:02.033
And look horrible.
