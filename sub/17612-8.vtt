Oh, Geez.

00:49.531 --> 00:52.078
Stan.

00:58.334 --> 01:01.131
Look, I'm, uh...
I'm sorry about this,

Terrific.

02:16.004 --> 02:17.102
Y'ello?

02:17.144 --> 02:19.504
Yeah, hey, uh, Leon,
I need you to come get me.

02:19.535 --> 02:21.871
I, uh... I blew a tire.

02:21.910 --> 02:23.916
I'm on county road 8.
I think I'm just past the, uh...

02:23.941 --> 02:24.955
Well, the...

02:24.980 --> 02:28.457
The thing is I-I can't
get over there right now.

02:28.527 --> 02:30.230
I'm on a stakeout.

02:30.402 --> 02:32.363
Oh, God.
Is this that woman again?

02:32.433 --> 02:34.631
I'm... I'm not at Liberty... 
- Okay, Leon,

02:34.686 --> 02:36.936
listen to me... hiding in the bushes

02:36.949 --> 02:38.861
outside the house of
a woman that you went out with,

02:38.886 --> 02:41.722
what, twice in high school
does not constitute a stakeout!

02:41.801 --> 02:44.793
Oh! Shh! Here she comes!

02:47.910 --> 02:49.293
Ohh!

02:49.386 --> 02:51.652
So, it's <i> three</i> kids now.

02:51.879 --> 02:53.893
That's your move.

02:54.527 --> 02:57.028
And the dance continues.

02:57.169 --> 03:00.795
<i>We now return to "Rattlers!
Nature's Death Machine."</i>

03:00.895 --> 03:03.426
<i>Since the dawn of time,
man has wondered,</i>

03:03.504 --> 03:06.247
<i>"what if my penis lived alone
in the woods</i>

03:06.317 --> 03:07.622
<i>and was poisonous?"</i>

03:07.676 --> 03:09.571
Amen, brother.

03:12.715 --> 03:14.008
Jell-o.

03:14.059 --> 03:17.372
Hey, Stan! Hey, you busy?

03:17.566 --> 03:19.355
Evie, please don't do that
with your voice.

03:19.394 --> 03:21.558
If you want something,
just go ahead and ask for it.

03:21.633 --> 03:24.128
Okay, look...
I-I blew a tyre, and...

03:24.230 --> 03:26.628
For some reason,
I don't have a spare.

03:26.706 --> 03:28.199
That's 'cause
I don't believe in them.

03:28.261 --> 03:29.683
They're a sign of weakness.

03:29.941 --> 03:31.495
In any case,
make sure and hit me back

03:31.550 --> 03:33.894
as soon as you get
your situation all squared away.

03:33.972 --> 03:35.058
No!...

03:35.084 --> 03:35.894
Please stay on.

03:35.927 --> 03:37.230
Don't hang up.

03:40.473 --> 03:43.274
Keep your pants on for a second.

03:47.047 --> 03:49.285
What, uh...

03:49.363 --> 03:50.511
What is all this?

03:50.605 --> 03:52.449
I am starting my own business.

03:52.480 --> 03:56.855
I am gonna clean people's teeth
right out of this house.

03:57.050 --> 03:59.019
Don't, uh... don't you need
to go to school

03:59.066 --> 04:00.002
For something like that?

04:00.027 --> 04:02.730
Yeah, you do
if you want to be a <i> dentist.</i>

04:02.777 --> 04:07.233
But I'm just gonna brush
people's teeth really hard.

04:07.865 --> 04:08.874
Evie, sit tight.

04:08.904 --> 04:10.318
I'll be right there.

04:10.397 --> 04:12.139
Oh, my God... thank you,
thank you, thank you!

04:12.186 --> 04:15.467
Uh, y-you will be back in your chair
within an hour. I swear.

04:15.506 --> 04:17.858
Oh, no, no. Think nothing of it.

04:17.951 --> 04:19.959
There's... there's no rush
when you're helping a friend.

04:20.029 --> 04:23.209
In fact, I may be very well be
out of the house all day.

04:23.256 --> 04:26.436
Th-there are some times when
I just want to get in the car

04:26.483 --> 04:28.302
and drive and drive and drive

04:28.358 --> 04:31.397
until everything I've done in
my life is rendered meaningless.

04:31.422 --> 04:32.983
And when I do
step out of the vehicle,

04:33.037 --> 04:36.381
I'm a... I'm a new man.

04:37.217 --> 04:40.081
Did y... did you ever feel
that way?

04:59.730 --> 05:01.730
Thank you, seriously. I owe you.

05:01.755 --> 05:03.762
Yeah.

05:05.875 --> 05:07.441
What the hell?!

05:09.932 --> 05:12.066
Okay.

05:14.383 --> 05:16.635
What the...?

05:16.796 --> 05:18.299
What?

05:39.228 --> 05:40.385
Y'ello?

05:40.447 --> 05:44.978
Yeah, uh, h-hey, Leon, uh...
I need you to come get me.

05:45.080 --> 05:46.252
Well, I can't get over there
right now.

05:46.283 --> 05:48.994
- I-I'm on a stakeout.
- Stakeout.

05:49.072 --> 05:50.018
Yeah.

05:50.088 --> 05:52.330
Thanks anyway.

05:56.719 --> 05:59.189
<i>"...The woods and was poisonous?"</i>

05:59.408 --> 06:01.332
Amen, brother.

06:03.361 --> 06:04.611
Jell-o.

06:04.674 --> 06:06.221
Hey, Stan!

06:06.299 --> 06:11.057
Listen, I-I blew a tyre
and, uh, you know, no spare.

06:12.820 --> 06:14.954
I'll be right there.

06:18.081 --> 06:19.947
What's with you?

06:21.447 --> 06:22.502
Didn't this...

06:22.557 --> 06:23.799
Already happen?

06:23.877 --> 06:25.838
What, me doing you favors
and you saying weird shit?

06:25.885 --> 06:27.955
Yeah, that... that seems
vaguely familiar, yeah.

06:28.018 --> 06:30.491
No, seriously, Stan, I...

06:30.752 --> 06:31.853
You know what? Slow down.

06:31.899 --> 06:33.408
Why, what are you gonna do,
give me a speeding ticket?

06:33.472 --> 06:34.689
I'm not even speeding.

06:34.736 --> 06:36.143
Seriously, Stan, just slow down.

06:36.189 --> 06:39.066
You know...
stop the car, stop the car!

06:41.185 --> 06:42.985
Oh, what the hell?

06:47.728 --> 06:49.720
You all right?

06:50.048 --> 06:50.963
Okay.

06:51.036 --> 06:52.213
You're gonna be okay.

06:52.287 --> 06:55.048
We can help you, okay?

06:57.404 --> 06:59.275
I'm the sheriff.

06:59.618 --> 07:01.451
Just tell me...

07:09.009 --> 07:10.045
Jell-o.

07:10.070 --> 07:11.476
Hey, Stan, I don't have time
to explain.

07:11.501 --> 07:13.259
I need you to come get me.

07:14.057 --> 07:15.705
I'll be right there.

07:21.078 --> 07:22.502
Stop the car!

07:23.942 --> 07:25.742
Oh, what the hell?!

07:27.705 --> 07:29.275
Don't move!

07:29.580 --> 07:31.002
What the hell are you doing?

07:31.054 --> 07:33.681
It's Wendy from "Peter Pan,"
for Christ's sake.

07:33.845 --> 07:36.009
She got the nightgown,
the big eyes, the...

07:36.048 --> 07:37.884
She got the whole thing.

07:38.009 --> 07:39.306
Who are you?

07:39.431 --> 07:41.728
And why did you
kill me last time,

07:41.775 --> 07:45.002
And why was there a last time
and a time before that?!

07:45.142 --> 07:46.627
What the hell is going on?

07:46.861 --> 07:49.556
He... he did not send you?

07:49.713 --> 07:50.775
Who?

07:50.838 --> 07:52.244
He is the one doing this.

07:52.298 --> 07:53.494
He won't let me go.

07:53.595 --> 07:56.713
Evie, can we please
wrap this up?

07:56.830 --> 07:59.244
- I'm talking!
- Let's go!

07:59.759 --> 08:01.533
You are Evie?

08:02.370 --> 08:04.423
I'm afraid he wants you, too.

08:04.588 --> 08:06.787
Who wants me?

08:15.489 --> 08:17.725
- Come on!
- Ah.

08:20.373 --> 08:23.912
I should have stayed home
and watched my snake show.

08:26.256 --> 08:28.131
Hello? Ms. Livingston?

08:28.209 --> 08:30.444
Yes. My name is Denise Miller.

08:30.506 --> 08:32.669
I'm calling
with a very special offer

08:32.793 --> 08:35.427
from White Power Tooth Cleaning.

08:35.857 --> 08:38.006
N-no, no. It's...

08:38.357 --> 08:40.811
No, it's... it's white
<i>power</i> tooth cleaning,

08:40.897 --> 08:43.436
Not white power tooth clea...

08:43.662 --> 08:46.233
No, that is
a very terrible name.

08:54.882 --> 08:57.811
Oh, for Christ sake...
look at this.

08:57.980 --> 09:00.436
Evie... a can of schlitz beer.

09:00.475 --> 09:01.631
They don't even
make this stuff anymore.

09:01.701 --> 09:03.272
It's probably worth something.

09:03.365 --> 09:05.655
Well, that's a museum piece
right the...

09:05.803 --> 09:07.725
Oh, I'm swimming in butter
today.

09:07.865 --> 09:09.201
We got another one.

09:09.319 --> 09:11.451
It's gonna be a challenge,
but we can...

09:11.576 --> 09:14.115
We can drink it. Ooh!

09:14.459 --> 09:16.311
That's what
I've been looking for.

09:16.397 --> 09:17.983
Winne... oh! It's got bees in it.

09:18.045 --> 09:19.701
Well, you know,
bees traditionally love schlitz,

09:19.740 --> 09:22.483
But you know what to do to bees.
You collapse the can.

09:29.230 --> 09:31.931
Okay. Let's try this again.

09:37.953 --> 09:39.053
Come on!

09:39.139 --> 09:40.780
Should have stayed home.

09:51.334 --> 09:53.601
Jesus, Evie.

09:56.240 --> 09:59.780
Say, uh, Evie, can I ask you
a personal question?

10:00.107 --> 10:01.763
Exactly when
would you like to talk about

10:01.795 --> 10:03.100
that crazy chick
you just killed?

10:03.139 --> 10:05.872
Stan, look at that.

10:10.960 --> 10:13.695
What in the hell does <i> that</i> say?

10:14.716 --> 10:17.029
Aah! Oh, my God!

10:17.287 --> 10:19.685
It's all for the best.

10:20.342 --> 10:23.053
He was just slowin' you down.

10:23.310 --> 10:24.881
Who are you?

10:25.224 --> 10:27.124
I see you found my stick.

10:27.670 --> 10:31.029
I hated parting with it,
but clearly, you needed it.

10:31.217 --> 10:33.545
It's gonna make it easier
to deal with them.

10:33.685 --> 10:36.201
Wait, you...
you left this for me?

10:36.389 --> 10:39.380
Oh, those two don't fight fair.

10:39.638 --> 10:41.638
As it is...

10:42.036 --> 10:44.144
We both stuck here.

10:46.497 --> 10:48.381
Hello! Mrs. Modig?

10:48.447 --> 10:50.144
Yes. We're taking a survey.

10:50.169 --> 10:51.997
Would you rather
have your teeth whitened

10:52.044 --> 10:54.364
by "Mighty Whities,"
"fun n' gums,"

10:54.474 --> 10:56.856
Or "good times in your mouth"?

10:56.996 --> 10:58.255
What?

10:58.348 --> 11:00.915
Go... What myself?

11:01.536 --> 11:03.373
The time loop...

11:03.498 --> 11:05.699
I mean, surely,
you notice it by now.

11:05.952 --> 11:07.006
I mean, somethin's supposed to
happen today.

11:07.031 --> 11:09.295
But it ain't gonna happen
if you die.

11:09.327 --> 11:10.350
Well...

11:10.389 --> 11:13.241
Ain't gonna happen if that gal
from the forest dies, either,

11:13.350 --> 11:15.045
'cause if any one of you dies...

11:15.241 --> 11:17.662
I mean,
we startin' all over again.

11:17.928 --> 11:20.537
W-W-What is supposed to happen?

11:20.850 --> 11:24.891
Well, you supposed to destroy
constable Eccles.

11:26.428 --> 11:29.803
I'm supposed to kill a guy
who's been dead for 400 years?

11:29.881 --> 11:31.592
Well, if you continue down
this path here,

11:31.654 --> 11:35.037
You're gonna find him
very much alive.

11:35.295 --> 11:38.475
Now, it ain't gonna be as simple
as a big stick to the head,

11:38.533 --> 11:40.500
I'll tell you that right now.

11:43.366 --> 11:44.764
Oh, hello. Yes.

11:44.850 --> 11:47.936
Is this the office
of the klu... Klux...

11:47.975 --> 11:50.655
Oh, my God. Never mind. So...

11:56.116 --> 11:58.037
Terrible. Whew.

11:58.092 --> 11:59.670
<i>Now, the secret cemetery,</i>

11:59.733 --> 12:02.983
Hmm, the one with
the 172 witches buried in it?

12:03.131 --> 12:04.022
I know it.

12:04.077 --> 12:08.695
Yeah, well, what you don't know
is there's <i> 173</i> graves there.

12:09.506 --> 12:11.765
And the last one...

12:11.905 --> 12:13.900
It belongs to Eccles.

12:14.295 --> 12:17.225
Although the nameplate on it
says, "Avner."

12:17.311 --> 12:20.440
It's his way
of hiding in plain sight.

12:20.873 --> 12:24.511
Now, you must dig up the grave
and take out his eyes.

12:24.866 --> 12:26.212
T-take o...

12:28.043 --> 12:29.435
Wow.

12:29.519 --> 12:31.544
Sorry, it's, uh...
just when I thought

12:31.584 --> 12:34.350
things couldn't get any weirder,
you know...

12:34.584 --> 12:37.557
The eyes of the grave
have seen his death.

12:38.717 --> 12:41.069
And when they look
into the soul,

12:41.209 --> 12:42.929
then he will meet his true end,

12:42.964 --> 12:46.709
And the time will close
once and for all.

12:46.950 --> 12:48.458
And...

12:48.850 --> 12:50.647
And my friend... he'll be okay?

12:50.694 --> 12:51.722
To save him,

12:51.764 --> 12:54.268
You're gonna have to
go back to the beginning.

12:54.889 --> 12:55.819
How?

12:55.983 --> 12:57.510
I don't know.

12:58.162 --> 12:59.889
Although
you could kill yourself.

13:00.148 --> 13:01.081
Great.

13:01.116 --> 13:03.467
Oh, don't worry, gal.

13:03.975 --> 13:05.303
You in luck!

13:06.853 --> 13:09.120
God damn it!

13:12.264 --> 13:14.217
<i>The baby rattler
emerges from its leathery egg,</i>

13:14.278 --> 13:17.177
<i>seeking maternal comfort
and murder.</i>

13:17.286 --> 13:19.219
Been there, done that.

13:21.115 --> 13:22.364
Yeah?

13:22.389 --> 13:23.928
Hey, Stan, um, listen...

13:23.975 --> 13:25.264
I don't...
I don't have time to explain,

13:25.311 --> 13:27.897
But, uh, I need a big favor.

13:27.994 --> 13:30.405
- No, today's not a very good day.
- Oh, crap!

13:34.737 --> 13:37.304
It's no problem.
I can leave immediately.

13:43.709 --> 13:44.708
Hey there, sheriff.

13:44.744 --> 13:47.178
Kevin.

13:47.213 --> 13:49.947
Want to see a dead body?

13:51.096 --> 13:53.197
Little cemetery humor.

13:53.236 --> 13:56.721
I'm looking for a grave
marked "Avner."

13:58.838 --> 14:00.081
You know about that?

14:00.179 --> 14:01.445
Know about what?

14:01.739 --> 14:03.534
Well, the... the town ledger

14:03.559 --> 14:06.960
has 172 people burned
for witchcraft buried here

14:07.625 --> 14:09.358
And, you know, over there.

14:09.422 --> 14:11.616
But there's <i> 173</i> graves,

14:11.699 --> 14:16.264
and "Aavner" is the one name
not in the ledger.

14:16.803 --> 14:18.576
Where is it?

14:20.435 --> 14:22.983
Say, kev, those are fabulous.

14:23.531 --> 14:26.165
Come on.

14:27.023 --> 14:29.590
There it is... Avner.

14:29.922 --> 14:31.288
Well, uh...

14:32.671 --> 14:34.452
Whatever happens from here
on out is none of my business.

14:34.516 --> 14:36.655
Yeah, you, uh... you go ahead
and get us started,

14:36.686 --> 14:39.763
and I, uh...
I'll be back in a jiff.

14:49.467 --> 14:52.764
That's the thing about Hendrix
is he only made three albums,

14:52.790 --> 14:54.790
And "Band of Gypsys" was live.

14:54.958 --> 14:56.920
Now, bootsy Collins...

14:59.991 --> 15:01.256
I think we're here.

15:01.295 --> 15:03.381
Now, you see what happens
when we work together?

15:03.456 --> 15:04.639
You didn't...

15:04.703 --> 15:06.241
I did all the diggin'.

15:06.350 --> 15:09.413
Now, don't be conceited, Kevo.
It's not flattering.

15:09.709 --> 15:11.428
Now, see if you can
hump that thing up.

15:11.506 --> 15:13.717
I'm gonna go find a place
to throw this out.

15:13.811 --> 15:16.030
I'm all about the environment.

15:27.819 --> 15:30.334
Outstanding effort, Kevo.

15:30.428 --> 15:32.316
Outstanding.

15:32.834 --> 15:34.030
All right.

15:34.089 --> 15:35.889
Let's open it up.

15:39.319 --> 15:42.381
Ooh.

15:42.553 --> 15:45.311
I have one last favor there,
little buddy.

15:45.780 --> 15:48.906
Reach in there and pinch out
those eyeballs for me.

15:51.861 --> 15:53.553
Here we go.

15:53.684 --> 15:56.118
Here <i> you</i> go.

16:00.633 --> 16:02.022
Did you get the eyes?

16:02.134 --> 16:05.272
I, uh... I went ahead
and brought you the whole head.

16:05.467 --> 16:07.952
I figured you'd want
to take the eyes out yourself.

16:08.100 --> 16:09.170
Gee, thanks.

16:09.195 --> 16:13.225
Now <i> I'm</i> the asshole?
Give me a break.

16:18.366 --> 16:19.881
All right, any second now,

16:19.950 --> 16:21.783
We should see, like,
a-a crazy-looking girl

16:21.849 --> 16:23.061
Run out into the road.

16:23.086 --> 16:24.092
What else is new?

16:24.130 --> 16:25.491
You know,
when I was a wee tot...

16:25.530 --> 16:26.850
Just when we see her,

16:26.913 --> 16:28.272
I need you
to take her home, okay?

16:28.303 --> 16:30.170
And do what with her,
give her a job?

16:30.280 --> 16:31.795
Can she fix things?
She good with tools?

16:31.859 --> 16:32.772
S-slam on your brakes.

16:32.827 --> 16:34.845
Why? Slam on your brakes!

16:34.880 --> 16:36.828
I don't see any... hey! You...

16:36.881 --> 16:38.447
for the love of God!

17:07.595 --> 17:09.233
Jell-o.

17:12.018 --> 17:13.257
Take that.

17:13.297 --> 17:15.118
Ah, bring it to the car.

17:18.983 --> 17:20.851
Okay, little nightgown girl...

17:20.876 --> 17:21.867
Why don't you go ahead

17:21.892 --> 17:23.679
and drop that knife
you got tucked in there, huh?

17:23.772 --> 17:24.882
Drop it, drop it.

17:24.906 --> 17:25.772
Let it go.

17:25.798 --> 17:27.507
Perfect, perfect.

17:27.833 --> 17:29.164
You follow directions very well,
Wendy.

17:29.256 --> 17:30.586
You're a lot more dangerous
than you look.

17:30.659 --> 17:32.516
Watch your head. There you go.

17:32.603 --> 17:34.236
Speaking of heads...

17:34.461 --> 17:37.094
And we're good.

17:37.141 --> 17:38.289
Heading off with the head,

17:38.315 --> 17:39.836
asked for the eyes.

17:50.168 --> 17:51.868
So, uh...

17:53.492 --> 17:55.211
You from around here?

17:55.852 --> 17:58.530
What would you say
you do for fun?

17:59.156 --> 18:00.586
Praying. You pray.

18:00.703 --> 18:02.359
Boy, that's fun.

18:02.640 --> 18:04.797
That's a Goddamn
barrel of monkeys.

18:04.867 --> 18:07.666
My friend Steve...
he prayed a lot.

18:07.843 --> 18:10.510
Steve's dead...
horrible tragedy.

18:11.024 --> 18:14.297
Taken away too young,
like all the great ones.

18:14.561 --> 18:17.000
Janis, Jim Morrison.

18:17.555 --> 18:18.782
Oh.

18:18.818 --> 18:21.185
Mark Smith from a county over.

18:22.405 --> 18:23.971
He's a stone Mason.

18:33.632 --> 18:34.732
Evie!

18:35.727 --> 18:37.305
Did you bring the eyes?

18:37.397 --> 18:38.596
Well...

18:38.874 --> 18:40.047
Brought the head.

18:40.121 --> 18:41.899
It comes with eyes.

18:42.867 --> 18:44.633
This way.

18:47.614 --> 18:50.287
Uh...

18:53.373 --> 18:54.605
Evie.

18:55.590 --> 18:57.590
Evie.

19:00.621 --> 19:01.982
Ah.

19:02.287 --> 19:04.944
Thank you for the eyes.

19:09.748 --> 19:11.943
No, no, no, no.

19:12.557 --> 19:14.162
Go slow.

19:17.193 --> 19:19.726
See, you got
a nasty bump, there.

19:19.761 --> 19:22.162
Where am I?

19:22.417 --> 19:25.084
Relax, dear.

19:25.784 --> 19:28.818
All is as it should be.

19:30.349 --> 19:32.006
I got my eyes now.

19:35.217 --> 19:37.568
I was able
to close the time loop.

19:38.477 --> 19:41.178
<i>Your</i> eyes?

19:43.740 --> 19:45.912
And my dear daughter...

19:46.342 --> 19:48.842
Constance is her name,
by the way.

19:49.388 --> 19:51.691
She's in your time now,

19:51.912 --> 19:55.228
safe from those who would
use her to destroy me.

19:55.920 --> 19:58.451
What do you mean, "My Time"?

19:58.582 --> 20:01.240
And with her there
and you here...

20:01.923 --> 20:03.013
I thought you might like to see

20:03.059 --> 20:05.584
what happened
to constance's mother.

20:06.287 --> 20:08.554
No!

20:13.084 --> 20:14.943
Evelyn Barret...

20:15.818 --> 20:18.418
as constable
of Willard's mill township,

20:18.740 --> 20:24.224
I, Thaddeus Eccles, accuse you
of the crime of witchcraft.

20:26.232 --> 20:27.756
No.

20:27.967 --> 20:29.396
No.

20:29.664 --> 20:30.930
No!

20:32.584 --> 20:36.045
<i>We now return to "Rattlers!
Nature's Death Machine."</i>

20:36.116 --> 20:38.811
<i>Since the dawn of time,
man has wondered,</i>

20:38.836 --> 20:41.849
<i>"what if my penis lived alone
in the woods</i>

20:41.888 --> 20:43.576
<i>and was poisonous?"</i>

20:48.864 --> 20:51.064
Mm.

21:17.202 --> 21:19.084
I may be right.
