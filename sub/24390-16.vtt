00:02.367 --> 00:02.667
- Previously on

00:02.667 --> 00:03.300
- Previously on
the "Southern Charm" reunion...

00:05.333 --> 00:07.100
Cameran, if you had to pick
one of these three guys

00:07.133 --> 00:09.266
for Palmer to date?
- I would pick Austen.

00:09.300 --> 00:11.133
- He's the only one
that would date a two-year-old.

00:11.166 --> 00:12.533
- [laughs]

00:12.567 --> 00:15.000
- Thomas made the decision
not to attend,

00:15.033 --> 00:18.166
but Ashley, Thomas' girlfriend,
is gonna be joining us.

00:18.200 --> 00:20.133
- Yay.
[laughter]

00:20.166 --> 00:22.433
- What do you want to do,
um, hair-wise?

00:22.433 --> 00:25.367
- I've been known to do this
thing, this hair-flipping thing

00:25.400 --> 00:27.033
when I'm nervous.

00:27.033 --> 00:28.667
[sighs]
Whatever you can do.

00:28.700 --> 00:31.133
- How did the current climate
of what's going on

00:31.166 --> 00:34.367
in this country
influence your attitude?

00:34.400 --> 00:37.433
- Every man in America
did, like, a mental "take stock"

00:37.467 --> 00:39.333
of the last 20 years
of their life.

00:39.367 --> 00:41.133
- Why did you track me
after we broke up

00:41.166 --> 00:42.600
and all the other crazy sh--
you did?

00:42.633 --> 00:44.433
- Because I still
wasn't over it.

00:44.467 --> 00:46.266
- You're still searching
for a reason that we broke up.

00:46.300 --> 00:47.700
- Jesus, let me talk.
- So obsessed with--

00:47.734 --> 00:49.600
- Please, you're just, like,
talking over me.

00:49.633 --> 00:51.066
And I don't miss this at all.
- No, I was actually still...

00:51.100 --> 00:52.600
- Now that I am a mother,

00:52.633 --> 00:54.266
I have so much more
empathy for you now.

00:54.300 --> 00:55.600
[crying] And, like,
I just can't imagine

00:55.600 --> 00:57.567
what you've been through
as a mom.

00:57.600 --> 01:00.533
And then to have all this sh--
you had to go through

01:00.567 --> 01:03.000
on top of it,
it makes me feel sick.

01:03.033 --> 01:04.467
- I'm assuming you watched

01:04.500 --> 01:07.200
what Ashley had to say to her
about her mothering?

01:07.200 --> 01:10.700
- Oh, yeah, I think
she's a horrible human being.

01:10.734 --> 01:12.333
Horrible.

01:12.333 --> 01:16.200
- I'm about to walk into
the lions' den,

01:16.200 --> 01:18.033
and, uh, speak my truth.

01:18.066 --> 01:19.567
I know it's gotten me
in some trouble.

01:19.600 --> 01:22.433
That's why it's, uh,
nerve-racking for me.

01:22.467 --> 01:25.533
[dramatic music]

01:27.767 --> 01:29.166
- I'm sorry that I--

01:31.233 --> 01:34.233
- Cam, got all teary-eyed.
Wow.

01:34.233 --> 01:36.066
- This is good, though.
Just speak your heart.

01:36.100 --> 01:38.233
- All right, folks, jump back
into positions, please.

01:38.233 --> 01:39.333
- Here we go.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.066
- Yeah.

01:41.100 --> 01:43.367
- Okay, quiet please.
Here we go.

01:43.367 --> 01:45.300
In three, two...

01:45.333 --> 01:49.567
- The "Southern Charm" reunion
continues now.

01:49.600 --> 01:51.567
- ♪ Mm-hmm ♪

01:51.600 --> 01:53.500
[soft jazzy music]

01:53.500 --> 01:56.734
Welcome to the "Southern Charm"
reunion, part two.

01:56.767 --> 01:59.100
I'm Andy Cohen.

01:59.133 --> 02:02.133
So I want to talk about
when you disappeared.

02:02.133 --> 02:03.667
- Yeah.

02:03.667 --> 02:05.500
- Did it surprise you
how upset your friends were

02:05.533 --> 02:07.633
when you took a time-out?

02:07.667 --> 02:09.400
- Uh, yeah, it surprised me that

02:09.400 --> 02:11.133
you were all calling each other

02:11.133 --> 02:12.633
and, like, it was all of y'all

02:12.667 --> 02:14.400
that were concerned.

02:14.433 --> 02:16.133
It's never really been that way.

02:16.133 --> 02:18.266
- At what age did you realize

02:18.300 --> 02:19.767
that you were
struggling with depression?

02:20.000 --> 02:22.400
- When I was 18,
I was in college,

02:22.400 --> 02:25.066
working in politics
and being around

02:25.100 --> 02:27.266
a whole bunch of men
who, like, objectified me,

02:27.266 --> 02:30.333
sent me into a depression,
I guess.

02:30.367 --> 02:32.266
- At that time,
were you self-medicating

02:32.266 --> 02:34.767
with--with drugs and alcohol?
- Yep.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.233
- So you went off
your anti-depressants.

02:37.266 --> 02:39.600
You thought "I'm in
a great place," and then...

02:39.633 --> 02:41.200
- Yeah.
- That didn't work out.

02:41.233 --> 02:43.033
- Yeah, I just felt
like I could do it.

02:43.033 --> 02:44.533
And I don't like being on meds.

02:44.567 --> 02:46.166
I don't want to be on meds
the rest of my life.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.233
I don't want to have to
depend on anything

02:47.266 --> 02:49.433
other than me to be normal.

02:49.433 --> 02:51.700
- So you're back
on the anti-depressants?

02:51.734 --> 02:55.033
- Yeah. Honestly, I'm glad
it came out on the show,

02:55.066 --> 02:57.533
because there's a lot of people
that won't admit it.

02:57.567 --> 02:59.533
- Yeah.
- And they suffer for so long.

02:59.567 --> 03:01.367
- Yeah.
- There's such a stigma around

03:01.400 --> 03:03.667
just the word "medication."

03:03.700 --> 03:05.433
And there shouldn't be
because...

03:05.433 --> 03:07.100
- The brain is an organ,
just like the body.

03:07.133 --> 03:08.567
- Right.
- And sometimes, yeah.

03:08.567 --> 03:10.367
- And people feel ashamed,
and they shouldn't.

03:10.400 --> 03:12.000
- Cameran, you suffer
from anxiety.

03:12.033 --> 03:13.300
- Oh, yeah.
- Are--have you--

03:13.333 --> 03:14.633
- And I've been
medicated before.

03:14.667 --> 03:16.166
- You have?
- [soft laugh] Yeah.

03:16.166 --> 03:18.000
- I feel pretty sh--y
at the moment

03:18.033 --> 03:20.567
because even though
I always had her back

03:20.600 --> 03:23.633
during times of conflict,
that doesn't mean

03:23.667 --> 03:26.700
I was necessarily there
for her all the time.

03:26.734 --> 03:28.467
Having someone's back
doesn't mean just, like,

03:28.500 --> 03:30.300
telling, you know,
Whitney to piss off.

03:30.333 --> 03:32.133
But it also means, like,
making sure that

03:32.166 --> 03:33.667
they're doing okay
every day, so.

03:33.700 --> 03:36.000
- And I think
Kathryn's depression

03:36.033 --> 03:37.467
has been circumstantial.

03:37.500 --> 03:40.033
I think anybody who has
gone through the bullsh--

03:40.066 --> 03:41.734
that you have gone through
is probably gonna come out

03:41.767 --> 03:43.333
and have some--
I mean, you're not--

03:43.367 --> 03:44.467
you're gonna be not normal
if you don't.

03:44.500 --> 03:46.133
You know?
I mean...

03:46.166 --> 03:48.467
- To have evolved to
the place that I'm at now

03:48.467 --> 03:50.533
and you guys recognize that

03:50.567 --> 03:52.200
and then be there for me

03:52.233 --> 03:54.734
even though I was
kind of crazy

03:54.767 --> 03:57.033
for, like, two or three years--
[soft laugh]

03:57.066 --> 03:58.467
it means more to me than...
- We're all human.

03:58.467 --> 04:00.200
- It happens.
- But see, like--

04:00.233 --> 04:02.200
- It kind of makes it real.
You're like, "Sh--"...

04:02.233 --> 04:04.033
- I know.
- And the courage.

04:04.066 --> 04:06.467
- We all have our bouts
of doing things

04:06.467 --> 04:08.100
in ways we wish we wouldn't.

04:08.100 --> 04:10.100
Um, drugs and alcohol.

04:10.100 --> 04:13.467
I can relate to--to--
being too crazy

04:13.500 --> 04:14.767
and staying up too late

04:14.767 --> 04:17.100
and having a cycle happen.
- Yeah.

04:17.100 --> 04:19.433
- And depression is
a part of that, or can be.

04:19.467 --> 04:21.734
But I'm just happy to see

04:21.767 --> 04:23.700
everybody very supportive
of Kathryn.

04:23.734 --> 04:25.233
That's all.
- Yeah.

04:25.233 --> 04:27.300
Well, after last year's
liver scare,

04:27.333 --> 04:28.767
Shep moved from downtown...
- [soft chuckle]

04:28.767 --> 04:31.767
- To the quieter, gentler
Isle of Palms.

04:31.767 --> 04:34.367
So now he can brown out
on the beach

04:34.367 --> 04:37.367
where the sand is
softer to face-plant on.

04:37.367 --> 04:38.767
[laughter]

04:38.767 --> 04:40.567
Colin from Raleigh said,
"Shep, what the hell

04:40.600 --> 04:43.333
"is the difference between
blacking out and browning out?

04:43.367 --> 04:46.367
Either way, it sounds like
you're still drinking too much."

04:46.367 --> 04:49.400
- Um, "browning out" is like
you have snapshot memories

04:49.433 --> 04:52.233
of little things that happened
over the course of the night.

04:52.266 --> 04:54.400
Blacking out is like
"what the hell happened?"

04:54.400 --> 04:57.000
- So is your doctor happy
with your drinking progress?

04:57.000 --> 04:58.734
- I hadn't gone to see him
in a bit.

04:58.767 --> 05:00.533
I feel fine, I really do.

05:00.567 --> 05:03.133
I mean, Austen,
you don't see me downtown

05:03.133 --> 05:03.734
half as much, right?

05:03.767 --> 05:05.367
- I mean, anything was better

05:05.400 --> 05:07.000
than what the hell
that you were doing.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.133
I mean...
- [chuckles] Yeah.

05:08.133 --> 05:09.233
- You don't stay
downtown anymore,

05:09.266 --> 05:10.667
which is a big improvement.

05:10.667 --> 05:13.066
But, I mean,
he was just showing me his phone

05:13.100 --> 05:14.767
and the women he's got--
I mean...

05:15.000 --> 05:16.400
- So?
No, I'm not talking about women;

05:16.400 --> 05:18.000
I'm talking about lifestyle.

05:18.033 --> 05:21.400
- How many times a week
do you get laid?

05:21.400 --> 05:23.066
- [chuckles] Oh, uh.

05:23.100 --> 05:25.133
Depends on where I am.
Um.

05:25.133 --> 05:26.467
- Four?
- [stammers]

05:26.500 --> 05:27.667
I'm gonna get in trouble
for this.

05:27.700 --> 05:29.133
- I know.
- I was gonna say four.

05:29.133 --> 05:30.500
- No, no.
- Between four and six.

05:30.533 --> 05:32.700
- No, no, no.
- Absolutely, Shep.

05:32.734 --> 05:34.433
- Austen, we think four to six?

05:34.467 --> 05:36.133
- I think four to six, yeah.
- You're crazy.

05:36.166 --> 05:37.433
You're crazy.
- That's a lot.

05:37.433 --> 05:39.133
- I mean, I'm jealous, sh--.

05:39.166 --> 05:40.700
- I can't believe you've
not got anybody pregnant.

05:40.734 --> 05:43.233
You might be sterile.
- Do you use birth control?

05:43.266 --> 05:45.567
- I mean, I--I try to,
I really do.

05:45.567 --> 05:47.033
- [laughs]
- "Try to."

05:47.066 --> 05:48.400
- Does that mean a condom
or you pull out?

05:48.433 --> 05:49.700
- Condom. Condom.
- You do use a condom?

05:49.734 --> 05:51.266
- If I c--if I--yeah.
- Shep.

05:51.300 --> 05:52.567
- You do?
- Shep.

05:52.600 --> 05:55.133
- I mean, if I know them,
I maybe don't.

05:55.166 --> 05:56.433
- I can't.

05:56.467 --> 05:58.433
- I had no idea that
you got that many girls.

05:58.433 --> 05:59.433
- And you don't have--
you're clean?

05:59.433 --> 06:00.700
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:00.734 --> 06:02.033
- It's amazing.
It's a miracle.

06:02.033 --> 06:03.567
- Let's jinx him up the wall.

06:03.567 --> 06:05.633
He'll have four babies next week
and have every STD.

06:05.667 --> 06:07.767
- Don't jinx it.
- [soft laugh] God.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.567
- Well, it was fun to watch you
on "RelationShep,"

06:10.600 --> 06:12.533
your dating show.
- Yeah.

06:12.567 --> 06:14.667
- Uh, Elle from Tucson said,
"On 'RelationShep,' I thought

06:14.700 --> 06:17.333
you had a great, grown-up
connection with Priscilla..."

06:17.367 --> 06:20.200
- Can I save you
from this horrid world?

06:20.233 --> 06:22.333
- You want to?
- [laughs]

06:22.333 --> 06:24.567
[smooth electronic music]

06:25.500 --> 06:28.467
- "But you ended up
picking the 22-year-old..."

06:28.500 --> 06:30.400
- What's your longest?

06:30.433 --> 06:32.400
- A year and a half.
- When was that?

06:32.433 --> 06:34.200
- 2004?

06:34.200 --> 06:36.200
- So I was in fourth grade.

06:36.200 --> 06:38.734
[both laugh]

06:38.734 --> 06:40.467
- "It doesn't seem like
you really want

06:40.500 --> 06:42.433
a committed relationship."

06:42.467 --> 06:44.700
I mean, let's be real.

06:44.734 --> 06:47.033
You don't want
a committed relationship, right?

06:47.066 --> 06:49.000
And there's no crime in that.
- Well, no, there's not.

06:49.033 --> 06:51.600
And I see all the clichés
in front of me,

06:51.633 --> 06:54.166
and I fall--trap--
right into them every time.

06:54.200 --> 06:55.467
- You're 38 years old.
- Yeah.

06:55.500 --> 06:58.467
- And you just threw
your first dinner party?

06:58.500 --> 07:01.033
- [tsks] No.
Well...

07:01.066 --> 07:02.367
- We got a lot of tweets.

07:02.400 --> 07:04.500
"Fricking frack grilling
is more entertaining than

07:04.500 --> 07:06.500
all the housewives combined."
- "Fricking frack."

07:06.500 --> 07:09.734
- "How many privileged idiots
does it take to grill ribs?"

07:09.767 --> 07:11.767
- You said you were
a grill master.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.767
- Is this normal grilling?
- Essentially.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.700
You should know that
you have to turn over ribs

07:15.734 --> 07:18.200
and cook both sides.
- You--but you don't know.

07:18.233 --> 07:20.200
- No, I don't.
- So instead of bullsh--ing...

07:20.233 --> 07:21.233
- I'm not--
- I'm looking it up.

07:21.233 --> 07:22.467
- I--okay, look it up.

07:22.500 --> 07:23.700
- Right?
- Sure.

07:23.734 --> 07:25.166
- 'Cause you don't know.
If you knew--

07:25.200 --> 07:26.633
- No, no, I never
claimed to know.

07:26.667 --> 07:28.700
- Um, Craig, have you
smoked any meat lately?

07:28.734 --> 07:31.100
- I have not smoked
any meat lately.

07:31.100 --> 07:32.600
- Damn.
- I know, right?

07:32.633 --> 07:34.100
- You were so patient
with Craig this season.

07:34.100 --> 07:36.000
- Yeah.
- What changed?

07:36.000 --> 07:37.467
- Well, honestly, I'm not--
when I'm not hungover,

07:37.500 --> 07:38.734
I'm just like...
- [laughs]

07:38.767 --> 07:41.400
- Life is a--is just--is a gift.
- Right?

07:41.433 --> 07:43.200
- Let's just laugh and have fun

07:43.233 --> 07:44.667
and poke fun at each other.

07:44.700 --> 07:46.133
So that's how I feel.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.734
- Shep, next year
you're gonna be

07:47.767 --> 07:50.266
officially middle-aged.

07:50.266 --> 07:52.266
Your body's kind of
already falling apart.

07:52.266 --> 07:53.333
Has your knee
fully recovered yet?

07:53.367 --> 07:55.133
- Yes, my knee's in good shape.

07:55.133 --> 07:57.333
- After your knee surgery,
Kathryn picked you up

07:57.367 --> 07:59.200
and brought you soup,

07:59.233 --> 08:03.133
which had a lot of people hoping
for a Shep-Kat relationship.

08:03.166 --> 08:05.066
- Honestly,
I'd be lying if I said

08:05.100 --> 08:07.000
I didn't look back
at our time together

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
all those years ago
and been like,

08:09.033 --> 08:11.000
"Gosh, if this hadn't've
happened that way..."

08:11.033 --> 08:12.633
- Yeah.

08:12.667 --> 08:14.133
Shep.
- Yeah?

08:14.133 --> 08:15.233
- Are you gonna teach me
how to surf?

08:15.266 --> 08:16.400
- Right now?
- Perhaps.

08:16.400 --> 08:17.700
- Yeah.
Love to.

08:17.700 --> 08:20.133
[soft dramatic music]

08:20.166 --> 08:22.100
- You seem to have
great chemistry.

08:22.133 --> 08:23.567
- Physically it was
a lot of fun.

08:23.567 --> 08:25.500
Yeah.
- You did hook up?

08:25.533 --> 08:27.567
- She was really good.
- Oh--

08:27.600 --> 08:29.433
[laughter]
- Oh, Lord!

08:29.433 --> 08:31.400
- That's a--endorsement.
I'm sorry, right?

08:31.433 --> 08:33.033
- It's a great compliment.
- Endorsement?

08:33.033 --> 08:35.433
- The armoire hasn't shut up.
- Oh, my...

08:35.467 --> 08:37.300
[laughter]
- Oh, yes.

08:37.300 --> 08:38.667
[laughter]

08:38.700 --> 08:41.433
- Now that that's out there.
[laughs]

08:41.433 --> 08:43.767
- Um, how many times
did you hook up?

08:44.000 --> 08:46.133
- Three? Four?
- Five.

08:46.166 --> 08:47.433
[laughter]
- Oh, my God.

08:47.433 --> 08:49.133
- I wanna know
how long it's been.

08:49.166 --> 08:51.166
- That might have happened
after Kensie was born once.

08:51.166 --> 08:52.300
- Yeah, she said in the show...
- Oh.

08:52.333 --> 08:54.233
- Oh!
- Oh!

08:54.266 --> 08:55.400
- She said in the show that
it was after Kensie was born.

08:55.433 --> 08:57.000
- I didn't...

08:57.033 --> 08:58.433
- No, that's, like,
we don't know that.

08:58.433 --> 09:00.033
- It was a crazy night...
- That was a year after.

09:00.066 --> 09:02.000
- We were at the Palace Hotel.
- Yeah.

09:02.033 --> 09:04.066
- And we kind of were flirting.

09:04.066 --> 09:05.000
- That's amazing.
- But at least I was nice.

09:05.033 --> 09:06.433
I left before he woke up.

09:06.467 --> 09:08.200
[both laugh]

09:08.233 --> 09:10.000
- Um, I mean, look,

09:10.033 --> 09:12.066
the night is young.

09:12.066 --> 09:13.600
- There's always an annual.

09:13.633 --> 09:15.333
- Yeah, your reunion hook-up.

09:15.367 --> 09:17.166
- I know, you have
a reunion hook-up every year,

09:17.200 --> 09:19.567
it seems like.
[laughter]

09:19.600 --> 09:20.600
Coming up...

09:20.600 --> 09:23.433
Does anyone with a penis

09:23.467 --> 09:26.467
besides me in this room
have any ambition?

09:26.467 --> 09:27.767
- [laughs]

09:31.333 --> 09:31.567
- Back with

09:31.567 --> 09:32.200
- Back with
the "Southern Charm" reunion.

09:34.066 --> 09:35.333
Shep, when you were
in Hilton Head,

09:35.367 --> 09:37.066
you told your mom you were
working on

09:37.066 --> 09:39.400
lengthening your fuse
and becoming less angry

09:39.433 --> 09:40.567
because you didn't want to be

09:40.600 --> 09:42.633
an angry old guy.
- Correct.

09:42.633 --> 09:46.367
- When you live alone,
it's very easy to become

09:46.367 --> 09:48.433
selfish with your time
and your space and everything

09:48.467 --> 09:50.100
because you don't have to
answer to anybody.

09:50.133 --> 09:52.200
Nobody's gonna call you out.
- Yeah.

09:52.233 --> 09:55.600
I'm a really--normally
congenial, happy person,

09:55.633 --> 09:57.467
and I found myself
not doing that.

09:57.500 --> 10:00.567
So I think I--I think
I'm trying to rectify it.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.734
I mean, I just--
I hate myself when I'm--

10:03.767 --> 10:05.633
when I can be mean-spirited
sometimes.

10:05.633 --> 10:07.734
And I think some people
have seen me mean-spirited.

10:07.767 --> 10:09.500
You're ----ing nuts, man.

10:09.533 --> 10:11.767
I wouldn't piss on you
if you were on fire right now.

10:11.767 --> 10:14.200
You do you; I'll do me.

10:14.233 --> 10:16.767
That's from now on.
'Cause I don't really care.

10:16.767 --> 10:18.600
I got a million friends.
Don't need any more.

10:18.633 --> 10:21.500
- So that's what's gonna happen?
- Yeah.

10:21.500 --> 10:23.333
- You know, at night, Shep,
I mean,

10:23.367 --> 10:24.667
we used to run into each other
and we'd be like,

10:24.667 --> 10:26.133
"Stay away from me.
Stay away from me."

10:26.133 --> 10:27.400
- Well, remember
how we'd get into, like,

10:27.433 --> 10:29.000
screaming matches...
- Right. Sure.

10:29.033 --> 10:30.767
- With somebody
about nothing at all.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
- I mean, it sounds silly, but
I moved home for a little bit,

10:33.033 --> 10:34.533
when I was living downtown.

10:34.567 --> 10:37.000
And then when I
came down to live with her,

10:37.033 --> 10:39.400
like, moving out of downtown's
why I can live in Charleston.

10:39.400 --> 10:41.100
- Yeah.
- Downtown is just--it's not...

10:41.133 --> 10:42.667
- Wow, I need to go downtown.

10:42.700 --> 10:44.133
- That's why we tell you
to come downtown.

10:44.133 --> 10:45.200
- It's like
living on Bourbon Street.

10:45.233 --> 10:46.533
- Yes, yes, it's Bourbon Street.

10:46.533 --> 10:48.400
It would be like
living on Bourbon Street.

10:48.400 --> 10:50.467
- Um, you got some heat
from your castmates

10:50.500 --> 10:52.266
when you called out Austen...
- Yeah.

10:52.266 --> 10:54.233
- For partying more than you do
these days.

10:54.266 --> 10:56.266
- Austen is...

10:56.266 --> 10:58.467
I mean, he's what I was
two years ago.

10:58.500 --> 11:02.066
Downtown.
Lot of girls.

11:02.100 --> 11:06.133
Whatever, I just--I don't
get any pleasure from that.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.300
- Uh, Charlotte from
El Paso said,

11:08.300 --> 11:10.000
"Shep, what's up
with you and Austen?

11:10.033 --> 11:12.000
"You can't seem to pass up
an opportunity

11:12.033 --> 11:13.567
"to one-up him.

11:13.600 --> 11:16.433
Is it that you're still
salty he took Chelsea from you?"

11:16.467 --> 11:19.500
- [stammers] Jealousy
was a factor, and here's how.

11:19.533 --> 11:22.166
I dropped him off
the night before--

11:22.200 --> 11:24.100
I had something to do
early in the morning,

11:24.133 --> 11:25.400
and I dropped him off
at a bar.

11:25.433 --> 11:27.500
And I went to do my thing
and Austen--

11:27.533 --> 11:29.700
I called Austen, he's like,
"You missed the most epic night!

11:29.734 --> 11:33.100
There was girls everywhere!"
And I was like, "Sh--."

11:33.133 --> 11:35.700
So when I saw Chelsea,
I was a little bit like

11:35.700 --> 11:37.300
"Yeah, Austen's
having a lot of fun--"

11:37.300 --> 11:38.700
but it came across bad.

11:38.700 --> 11:40.100
And that's the worst move
in the world,

11:40.133 --> 11:41.567
is to talk someone else down.

11:41.567 --> 11:44.133
It never works.
So I do regret that, yeah.

11:44.166 --> 11:46.300
- Rachel from Honolulu said,
"Chelsea,

11:46.333 --> 11:48.734
"I get why you wanted
Austen to stand up to Shep.

11:48.734 --> 11:51.600
"Being is assertive is what
separates the boys from the men.

11:51.600 --> 11:54.200
And who wants to
be with a pushover?"

11:54.200 --> 11:55.667
Chelsea, was your issue
more about

11:55.700 --> 11:57.066
Shep getting away with stuff or

11:57.100 --> 11:59.333
Austen not
standing up for himself?

11:59.333 --> 12:01.533
- I think it was more

12:01.567 --> 12:03.300
Austen not
standing up for himself.

12:03.333 --> 12:05.200
- Mm.
- And the thing is is...

12:05.200 --> 12:07.066
- Mm, I mean, Chels', you have
like a short-term memory?

12:07.100 --> 12:08.400
- People think that I've put
you guys against each other--

12:08.433 --> 12:10.600
- I mean, do you not remember
last year?

12:10.600 --> 12:12.667
I mean, I got into
the biggest tiff with Shep

12:12.700 --> 12:15.400
on your behalf,
and it caused a serious rift

12:15.433 --> 12:17.133
in--in our friendship.

12:17.166 --> 12:19.033
And so for you to say that
I didn't stand up to myself--

12:19.066 --> 12:20.200
whatever, so be it.

12:20.200 --> 12:22.000
Shep said that he was sorry

12:22.033 --> 12:24.066
and--and my point of contention
was, like, "Hey!

12:24.100 --> 12:26.333
"Just like don't try to
make yourself look better to me.

12:26.367 --> 12:28.500
Like, just keep my name
out of your mouth."

12:28.533 --> 12:29.767
And then he was like, "Look,
I never should have said it.

12:29.767 --> 12:31.433
And I'm sorry."
And that was squashed.

12:31.467 --> 12:33.233
- No, but, like--

12:33.233 --> 12:35.033
I don't know, Chelsea,
did you see it--

12:35.066 --> 12:36.567
- I think there's something
between the two of you,

12:36.600 --> 12:39.100
and it's almost like
you're each trying to, like,

12:39.133 --> 12:41.100
win someone over
that's in your same group.

12:41.100 --> 12:43.166
And so you two
butt heads over that.

12:43.200 --> 12:45.500
- You don't have to tell him
everything I say, by the way.

12:45.500 --> 12:47.200
- I don't think it was that.
- I think that--

12:47.233 --> 12:48.500
- I just think that--
- I walked up to her--

12:48.500 --> 12:50.200
- The conversation
I had with you,

12:50.233 --> 12:51.700
and then I had a conversation
with him

12:51.734 --> 12:53.367
ten minutes before
you walked in the door

12:53.367 --> 12:55.300
were very different.

12:55.333 --> 12:56.500
- Oh, he was painting himself
as the choir boy of downtown?

12:56.533 --> 12:58.233
- Yeah, I said...
- Ooh.

12:58.233 --> 12:59.500
- "Shep's about to come in
and get a haircut."

12:59.533 --> 13:01.066
And he was like,
"Oh, we were out till

13:01.100 --> 13:02.300
"all hours of the night
last night.

13:02.333 --> 13:04.066
We had a rager."
- And in fact--

13:04.100 --> 13:05.767
- And then you came in and said
you were home by 9:00.

13:05.767 --> 13:07.367
- It was the night before.
- So I was like what's going on?

13:07.400 --> 13:09.333
- I don't know.
- It was the night before.

13:09.367 --> 13:11.133
- The timeline's difficult.
- "The timeline's difficult."

13:11.166 --> 13:12.633
- [chuckles]

13:13.567 --> 13:15.400
- So, Austen,
when we started this season,

13:15.400 --> 13:17.000
you were funemployed

13:17.000 --> 13:19.200
and cracking beers open by noon.

13:19.233 --> 13:21.233
Uh, is that still the case?

13:21.266 --> 13:23.100
- Uh--ah--no.

13:23.133 --> 13:24.600
- Are you funemployed?

13:24.633 --> 13:26.533
- Uh, well, I don't know,
you know,

13:26.567 --> 13:28.400
necessarily what "funemployed"--

13:28.400 --> 13:29.667
- Do you have a job?

13:29.700 --> 13:31.100
- I do not have a job, no.

13:31.133 --> 13:32.400
- There we go.
- Okay. No.

13:32.400 --> 13:33.400
- [soft laugh]

13:33.433 --> 13:36.400
- Does anyone with a penis

13:36.433 --> 13:39.400
besides me in this room
have any ambition?

13:39.400 --> 13:41.000
- [laughs]

13:41.033 --> 13:42.734
- The ambition is to not work.

13:42.767 --> 13:44.500
- [laughs]
- Literally.

13:44.533 --> 13:46.000
- Okay, now I get it.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.266
So you don't have a job.

13:47.266 --> 13:49.367
What's the status of your beer?

13:49.400 --> 13:53.433
- Well, I am in
the stages of branding...

13:53.433 --> 13:54.700
- Kay.

13:54.734 --> 13:56.266
- And pitching to distributors

13:56.300 --> 13:58.233
so that my beer can be
distributed throughout.

13:58.266 --> 13:59.567
- Do you have a name
for your beer?

13:59.600 --> 14:02.033
- The beer tentatively
is called "TropHop."

14:02.033 --> 14:03.367
So tropical hop.
- I like that.

14:03.400 --> 14:05.433
- I like it. TropHop.
- That's cute.

14:05.467 --> 14:08.033
- You know, your parents were
very popular on social media.

14:08.033 --> 14:09.433
- Yeah?
- I love your mom's attitude.

14:09.467 --> 14:10.700
She seems very no-nonsense.

14:10.734 --> 14:12.266
- She's kind of a--
she's no-nonsense.

14:12.300 --> 14:14.166
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

14:14.166 --> 14:15.433
- Austen, I'm gonna tell you...
- I'll tell you something else--

14:15.433 --> 14:18.166
- Hold on. I get to talk.
Hold on.

14:18.166 --> 14:19.767
- Her phrase, she's like
"Cut the sh--."

14:20.000 --> 14:21.033
- Right.
- I'm like...

14:21.066 --> 14:22.633
- And your dad was in the FBI.

14:22.667 --> 14:24.300
- He was, yeah, yeah.
- Wow.

14:24.300 --> 14:25.767
Billy from Fort Myers says,

14:26.000 --> 14:27.533
"How much beer
does Austen have to sell

14:27.567 --> 14:29.300
in order to pick up
the check on a date?"

14:29.300 --> 14:30.567
- [chuckles]

14:30.600 --> 14:32.700
- Um, why didn't you ever
pay for anything

14:32.734 --> 14:34.333
when you were dating Chelsea?

14:34.367 --> 14:37.266
- This is a fantastic question,
and I would love to

14:37.300 --> 14:38.433
clear the air on this.
- Okay.

14:38.467 --> 14:40.133
- Yeah, Chelsea and I--

14:40.166 --> 14:42.166
we didn't go out on dates.

14:42.200 --> 14:44.433
Chelsea, trying to get you out
of the house is pulling teeth.

we're leaving."

30:11.000 --> 30:12.266
- Okay.

30:12.266 --> 30:14.233
- At Shep's birthday party,

30:14.266 --> 30:16.667
did you and Thomas
have sex in the bathroom?

30:16.667 --> 30:18.200
- Hell no.
[laughter]

30:18.233 --> 30:19.633
Do you actually
think that happened?

30:19.667 --> 30:21.500
[dramatic music]

30:21.533 --> 30:24.133
[distant indistinct chatter]

30:24.133 --> 30:26.066
- Wanna come in here?

30:26.100 --> 30:27.100
[lock clicks]

30:27.133 --> 30:30.567
- [laughing]

30:33.467 --> 30:35.166
You can do that.
That's okay.

30:35.166 --> 30:36.667
- First of all,
Thomas doesn't do it

30:36.700 --> 30:38.433
anywhere other than the bed,
let's just be real.

30:38.433 --> 30:40.433
I've--he does not like to
do it anywhere else but the bed.

30:40.433 --> 30:41.567
- I would be--
- Oh, that's kind of boring.

30:41.567 --> 30:43.266
- Yeah.
- [laughs]

30:43.300 --> 30:44.367
- Kathryn says that's not true.
- Yeah, whatever.

30:44.400 --> 30:46.233
[laughter]

30:46.266 --> 30:47.700
- I just would have
no other reason to go

30:47.700 --> 30:50.233
into a bathroom at a party
with my boyfriend.

30:50.266 --> 30:52.133
Like, I--I don't know what else
you would do in there.

30:52.166 --> 30:54.300
- Well, I'm sorry, Naomie,
this was the first time

30:54.300 --> 30:56.433
that I'm in public
with all of you guys

30:56.433 --> 30:58.166
and a bunch of cameras,
and I thought I might have

30:58.166 --> 30:59.567
a moment of privacy
with my boyfriend

30:59.567 --> 31:01.400
to talk to him, so...
- Okay.

31:01.433 --> 31:03.300
- I--I do apologize
if I was being disrespectful.

31:03.300 --> 31:05.500
- No.
Have sex wherever you want.

31:05.533 --> 31:07.033
- I have more class than that.

31:07.033 --> 31:09.533
- Then I don't have any.
[laughter]

31:09.567 --> 31:11.367
- Okay, we're gonna
take a break.

31:11.400 --> 31:14.066
We'll be back with more
"Southern Charm" after this.

31:14.066 --> 31:15.433
Coming up...

31:15.467 --> 31:17.333
- God--I'm so sorry...
- Are you okay?

31:17.333 --> 31:18.700
- That I asked you to want to
spend time with your children.

31:18.734 --> 31:20.200
- That should be
Thomas' place, okay?

31:20.200 --> 31:21.567
- Well, you should've
jumped through fire

31:21.600 --> 31:23.266
to want to be there.
You could have been there.

31:26.467 --> 31:26.667
- Back with

31:26.667 --> 31:27.300
- Back with
the "Southern Charm" reunion.

31:28.633 --> 31:30.533
Loretta from Akron said,

31:30.567 --> 31:32.600
"Without passing judgment,
it's obvious that

31:32.600 --> 31:34.266
"Ashley is
completely committed to

31:34.300 --> 31:36.300
getting engaged
to Thomas Ravenel."

31:36.333 --> 31:39.734
- Well, a ring would be nice.
[soft laugh]

31:39.767 --> 31:43.200
Babe, this would be
a perfect place to propose.

31:43.200 --> 31:47.533
I think this would be an ideal
place to have a wedding.

31:47.567 --> 31:52.200
If you proposed to me tomorrow,
I would say yes.

31:52.200 --> 31:55.233
I love you.

31:55.233 --> 31:57.500
- Ashley, if Thomas
asked you to marry him today,

31:57.500 --> 31:59.767
you--you would say yes, right?

32:04.633 --> 32:06.100
- I'm not there yet.

32:06.100 --> 32:07.467
- Really?
- Mm-mm.

32:07.500 --> 32:09.166
- But you--what changed
in the last year?

32:09.200 --> 32:10.433
Is it the investigation
that's keeping you?

32:10.467 --> 32:12.200
- No, not at all.

32:12.233 --> 32:15.100
I think once I started working
and I got a job...

32:15.133 --> 32:17.200
- So you are working now? Yeah?
- Yes.

32:17.233 --> 32:19.033
You know, I just realized

32:19.066 --> 32:20.500
hold on, let's, like,
pump the breaks,

32:20.500 --> 32:22.500
and let's actually just
enjoy dating each other.

32:22.533 --> 32:25.166
- Well, a lot of people
online thought that

32:25.200 --> 32:27.300
you got caught up
in Thomas' money.

32:27.333 --> 32:29.333
Tinsley Mortimer tweeted,

32:29.367 --> 32:33.367
"Ashley really, really wants
to be T-Rav's widow."

32:33.400 --> 32:35.633
Uh, Ashley, is it
about the money?

32:35.667 --> 32:37.633
- If I want to
date someone with money,

32:37.667 --> 32:40.000
I can meet someone with a lot
more money than Thomas, okay?

32:40.033 --> 32:41.600
That's not money to me.

32:41.633 --> 32:43.333
I mean, I come from--
- He's the minor league.

32:43.367 --> 32:45.500
- I come from--yeah.
Santa Barb--Montecito.

32:45.533 --> 32:47.600
So that's--
- That's Oprah money, Montecito.

32:47.633 --> 32:49.533
- Correct.
And I've dated guys my own age

32:49.533 --> 32:51.533
with more money
than he has, okay?

32:51.533 --> 32:53.734
So it's--
it's just because he's--

32:53.767 --> 32:56.200
he's older and he's got money,
that's the stereotype.

32:56.233 --> 32:57.734
And I think that's unfair.

32:57.767 --> 32:59.467
And if you want to speak to
my last three ex-boyfriends,

32:59.500 --> 33:02.133
one was a DJ, one was a
bartender, and one was a surfer.

33:02.166 --> 33:03.667
And I made more money
than they did.

33:03.667 --> 33:06.500
But is it nice, Andy, to,
you know,

33:06.533 --> 33:08.734
be attracted to a man
who is accomplished

33:08.767 --> 33:10.367
and has worked hard
for what he has?

33:10.400 --> 33:12.767
I mean, if that's
what makes me a gold digger,

33:13.000 --> 33:15.367
then--then fine.
Then fine.

33:15.400 --> 33:19.033
- Um, Pauline from Boise said,
"Ashley, I felt bad for you

33:19.066 --> 33:20.667
"watching the scene at Nico
where Thomas was

33:20.700 --> 33:23.133
"flirting up a storm
with Kathryn.

33:23.166 --> 33:24.767
What are you doing
with this douchebag?"

33:25.000 --> 33:27.033
- Um, [speaking French]

33:32.266 --> 33:33.700
- Je t'aime.
- [speaks French]

33:33.700 --> 33:35.433
- I need another...

33:35.433 --> 33:38.033
It didn't bother me.
I was standing right there.

33:38.066 --> 33:39.700
- I thought his behavior
was inappropriate.

33:39.734 --> 33:41.433
- Yeah. I felt awkward.
- I would've gotten pissed off.

33:41.433 --> 33:42.667
- I thought it was--
the way he was leering at her--

33:42.700 --> 33:44.300
I thought it was
bullsh-- on his part.

33:44.300 --> 33:46.000
- He said "I love you"
in French to Kathryn.

33:46.033 --> 33:47.700
- Yeah, I mean, that--
that's got to affect you.

33:47.734 --> 33:49.567
You're a human being.
- It doesn't.

33:49.600 --> 33:51.133
- Oh, come...
- I wish it did.

33:51.166 --> 33:52.767
I wish I could say that,
but I feel so secure

33:53.000 --> 33:54.433
in this relationship that
if he wants to go and do that--

33:54.467 --> 33:56.133
- Back then?
- Yes!

33:56.166 --> 33:57.433
- All right.
- Yes.

33:57.467 --> 33:59.700
- So how's our new employee?

33:59.700 --> 34:02.133
- This is about me, okay?

34:05.066 --> 34:07.066
[indistinct chatter]

34:07.066 --> 34:09.033
- This is kind of a cool idea.

34:09.066 --> 34:10.467
- Don't stare.
- Don't stare?

34:10.500 --> 34:12.000
- [laughs]

34:12.033 --> 34:13.734
- Jeez.
- Why not?

34:13.734 --> 34:15.700
- I'm not insecure.

34:15.734 --> 34:18.200
I know he's coming home with me.
I don't--I don't care.

34:18.200 --> 34:21.066
- You had to have known
that it would upset Kathryn

34:21.066 --> 34:23.467
to see a picture of you
and Thomas and the kids

34:23.467 --> 34:24.734
trick-or-treating on Instagram.

34:24.767 --> 34:26.734
- Yes.
- So...

34:26.734 --> 34:28.200
- I didn't post the picture.

34:28.233 --> 34:29.600
- Who posted it the picture?
- Thomas.

34:29.633 --> 34:31.467
- Thomas posted the picture.
- Yes.

34:31.500 --> 34:33.433
But, Kathryn,
you could have been there.

34:33.467 --> 34:35.700
I asked you. You didn't
even give that a shot.

34:35.734 --> 34:37.667
- Why are you asking me
and inviting me?

34:37.700 --> 34:39.700
- Oh, I'm--
- What place, like, do you have?

34:39.734 --> 34:42.100
- Oh, God, God. I'm so sorry...
- Are you okay?

34:42.100 --> 34:43.467
- That I asked you to want to

34:43.500 --> 34:44.633
spend time with your children.
I'm so sorry.

34:44.667 --> 34:46.166
- That should be
Thomas' place, okay?

34:46.200 --> 34:47.500
- Well, you should've
jumped through fire

34:47.500 --> 34:49.433
to want to be there.
You could've been there.

34:49.467 --> 34:51.367
- On the other hand, you can
see why she wouldn't want to go

34:51.400 --> 34:53.633
trick-or-treating with her ex's
new girlfriend and the kids.

34:53.667 --> 34:55.633
- I didn't need to be
trick-or-treating with them.

34:55.633 --> 34:58.500
I could've been--sit in
the house, handing out candy.

34:58.500 --> 35:00.567
- Do you believe that?
- No.

35:00.600 --> 35:03.467
- Ashley, how did it feel
when Thomas suggested that

35:03.500 --> 35:05.233
Patricia give you
a Charleston makeover?

35:05.266 --> 35:08.200
Any regrets on spending
ten grand of his money?

35:08.233 --> 35:09.500
- Absolutely.

35:09.500 --> 35:12.033
When he asked
Patricia to take me out,

35:12.066 --> 35:14.200
I didn't know if
Gwynn's was picking it up.

35:14.233 --> 35:15.734
Certainly didn't think

35:15.767 --> 35:17.233
my boyfriend's credit card
was picking it up, okay?

35:17.266 --> 35:18.734
So--
- Didn't you bring it with you?

35:18.767 --> 35:20.633
- Of course I did,
'cause Thomas said

35:20.633 --> 35:22.233
"Just in case they don't--

35:22.233 --> 35:24.266
I don't want you
to look like an idiot."

35:24.266 --> 35:26.133
- You're a girl that's been
dating this guy for two months.

35:26.166 --> 35:27.734
You just spent
ten grand on his credit card.

35:27.767 --> 35:29.066
Like, you could have put
two and two together,

35:29.100 --> 35:30.467
how that would have looked.

35:30.500 --> 35:31.600
- Well, and then I was gonna
return it tomorr--

35:31.633 --> 35:32.600
the next day, Craig.

35:32.633 --> 35:34.100
- Did you return it?

35:34.133 --> 35:35.667
- No, 'cause Thomas
said "You deserve it.

35:35.700 --> 35:37.200
"You've earned it and Patricia--

35:37.233 --> 35:39.533
if Patricia loved it,
then I love it."

35:39.567 --> 35:41.000
- How did you earn it?
- So I don't like that you're--

35:41.033 --> 35:42.467
- What does that mean?

35:42.500 --> 35:44.333
- I've never seen Thomas--
he's so frugal.

35:44.367 --> 35:46.400
As, like, nice of a house
he lives in

35:46.400 --> 35:49.266
and as nice as he dresses,
he's a very frugal person.

35:49.300 --> 35:51.066
- Maybe with you, Kathryn.

35:51.100 --> 35:53.266
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah, maybe just with you.

35:53.266 --> 35:54.400
- Wow.
- No.

35:54.400 --> 35:56.100
Maybe with--yeah.
- Okay.

35:56.133 --> 35:59.066
I guess I wasn't deserving
of the nice things, huh?

35:59.100 --> 36:00.200
- Well, he did give you
two children,

36:00.233 --> 36:01.633
so he gave you something.
Yeah.

36:01.667 --> 36:03.533
- I didn't give him
the children, lovely.

36:03.567 --> 36:05.133
This is all making sense.
- You got two kids.

36:05.166 --> 36:07.166
- You're just so... [muttering]
I can't.

36:07.166 --> 36:09.166
- Patricia was really
a mentor to you

36:09.200 --> 36:11.100
and she was rooting
for your relationship

36:11.133 --> 36:13.000
throughout the season.
- Yes.

36:13.033 --> 36:15.166
- What's your relationship
with her now?

36:15.200 --> 36:17.166
- There's no relationship
with her.

36:17.200 --> 36:18.300
- What happened?

36:18.300 --> 36:20.433
- She was inciting me to go

36:20.467 --> 36:21.767
against you, Kathryn.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.300
- What does that mean?

36:23.333 --> 36:25.166
- She asked me how
Thomas and I were doing.

36:25.200 --> 36:26.567
And I said great.
And she says, "Good."

36:26.567 --> 36:28.166
She goes, "It might be
kind of selfish, but

36:28.200 --> 36:30.667
"I want to see you guys together
just for the fact

36:30.700 --> 36:33.433
that Kathryn can't
try to get him back," okay?

36:33.433 --> 36:36.400
I--[stammers]
my one biggest regret--

36:36.433 --> 36:38.133
can you look at me
when I'm talking to you?

36:38.166 --> 36:40.100
- Oh, yeah, sorry.
Distracted.

36:40.133 --> 36:41.700
- My one biggest regret

36:41.700 --> 36:44.133
was going on that shopping trip
with her,

36:44.166 --> 36:45.700
when I should have
gone with you.

36:45.734 --> 36:47.066
- That's your...
- That's your biggest regret?

36:47.100 --> 36:49.133
- Biggest regret?

36:49.166 --> 36:50.400
- Yeah.

36:50.433 --> 36:51.734
- So if you could
change one thing,

36:51.767 --> 36:53.300
that's what you would change?
- Yeah.

36:53.333 --> 36:55.300
- What happened
between you and Patricia

36:55.333 --> 36:56.734
to turn it south?

36:56.734 --> 36:59.066
- Well, someone was
calling Thomas a lunatic.

36:59.066 --> 37:01.000
And everyone was pretty much
saying it's Kathryn.

37:01.033 --> 37:03.600
And when I realized
it was this other person...

37:03.600 --> 37:05.066
- Someone else.
- That she's familiar with...

37:05.066 --> 37:06.333
- Patricia?
- Yes.

37:06.367 --> 37:08.400
- I told Patricia,
Thomas is hurt.

37:08.433 --> 37:10.200
What do you
have to say about this?

37:10.233 --> 37:11.533
- This is on social media
you're talking about?

37:11.567 --> 37:13.166
- Yes.
- And then Patricia said?

37:13.200 --> 37:15.200
- Yes.
"Oh, you're crazy to think that.

37:15.200 --> 37:17.200
"Kathryn is this person.
She is this troll.

37:17.200 --> 37:19.133
"Here's this account.
Block this account.

37:19.166 --> 37:20.433
Here's the one--"
And I'm going--

37:20.467 --> 37:21.700
- This is all
about social media?

37:21.734 --> 37:23.200
- Oh, my God.
- Yes.

37:23.200 --> 37:24.533
This is how it started.
- Wait a second.

37:24.567 --> 37:26.667
I--I observed on social media
you and Thomas

37:26.700 --> 37:29.633
systematically sabotaging
your relationship with Patricia.

37:29.633 --> 37:31.233
- Yeah.
- With certain tweets.

37:31.233 --> 37:33.500
Thomas said, "Why don't you
go back to New York,

37:33.533 --> 37:35.500
Miss Queen of Southern
Gentility?" to Patricia.

37:35.533 --> 37:37.166
I was like...

37:37.200 --> 37:38.200
- So this is what
the falling out was about?

37:38.233 --> 37:39.633
- Correct.
- Okay.

37:39.667 --> 37:41.300
- Because someone wrote
some bad things about Thomas.

37:41.333 --> 37:43.300
I mean, Patricia's
not in charge of other people.

37:43.333 --> 37:46.066
And--and that--there goes
the bridge, torched.

37:46.100 --> 37:47.767
And, like, she had been
so good to him, man.

37:47.767 --> 37:49.166
- [mumbles]
- So Thomas is not--

37:49.200 --> 37:50.567
- In the face of
a lot of bullsh--.

37:50.600 --> 37:52.600
- So Thomas is not
speaking to Patricia?

- Ooh, are you
threatening me now?

38:00.233 --> 38:02.033
- No, I'm not.
- This is so interesting.

38:02.066 --> 38:03.500
- I think you're lucky because
it would have counted as...

38:03.500 --> 38:05.300
- Obviously.
- A fail if you didn't make it.

38:05.333 --> 38:06.600
- It's none of your
----ing business to begin with.

38:06.633 --> 38:07.600
- [indistinct]
So they stayed open for you.

38:07.633 --> 38:09.000
- You're a complete asshole.

38:12.400 --> 38:12.667
- Welcome back to

38:12.667 --> 38:13.300
- Welcome back to
the "Southern Charm" reunion.

38:15.400 --> 38:17.767

weren't choppy enough,

their battered bodies

for a trip to Hilton "Headache."

38:23.667 --> 38:25.333

38:25.367 --> 38:27.133
- Let's talk about
these injuries for a second.

38:27.133 --> 38:28.767
Shep, you walked
into a glass door?

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
- Yes, I was at a party
and somebody was like,

38:31.000 --> 38:32.500
"There's a basketball court
downstairs."

38:32.533 --> 38:33.734
And I was like, "Yeah!"

38:33.767 --> 38:35.533
And I run down the stairs,

38:35.533 --> 38:37.734
and I'm talking smack
to everybody behind me.

38:37.767 --> 38:40.467
And there's just
a floor-to-ceiling glass door

38:40.500 --> 38:42.066
and I just ran right into it.

38:42.100 --> 38:44.667
- Um, had you seen a doctor yet

38:44.700 --> 38:48.000
for, uh, your finger
or did you get a splint at CVS?

38:48.000 --> 38:49.500
- No, I went to the hospital.
- You did?

38:49.533 --> 38:51.667
- Craig, it took you forever
to get it looked at.

38:51.700 --> 38:54.100
- No, but I got a splint
from the hospital.

38:54.133 --> 38:55.500
- The reason your thing's
mangled

38:55.533 --> 38:57.166
is 'cause you waited too long.

38:57.166 --> 38:59.000
- I gotta say,
I can't stop looking at that.

38:59.033 --> 39:00.700

I just--yeah, whatever.

39:00.734 --> 39:02.300

I like to see that

39:20.433 --> 39:22.767

about the birthday party.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.300
It could have been any party.

39:24.300 --> 39:26.300
It was more just
wanting to be included.

39:26.333 --> 39:29.667
- In Hilton Head, they were
really making an effort to

39:29.700 --> 39:31.166
try to make you included.

39:31.166 --> 39:33.033
I mean, they invited you
horseback riding.

39:33.066 --> 39:34.266
- But something turned.

39:34.300 --> 39:36.000
- And it was very quick.

39:36.033 --> 39:38.700
- You became feverishly obsessed

39:38.734 --> 39:40.433
with this birthday party.

39:40.467 --> 39:41.734
- Well, I already know
I'm not invited.

39:41.767 --> 39:43.266
- Okay, so why'd you ask?

39:43.300 --> 39:45.000
Are you trying to start
something with me?

39:45.033 --> 39:47.133
- I already know, like,
ten years from now--

39:47.166 --> 39:48.467
- You're probably not
gonna be here in a month, hon.

39:48.500 --> 39:49.600

- All right.

I don't plan on going anywhere.

So get used to me.

more than you see them.

39:58.500 --> 40:01.033

an overwhelming response

handled yourself in Hilton Head.

hurt deeply,

recovering

40:12.700 --> 40:14.600

more rights to her kids."

40:14.633 --> 40:18.100

come back

40:19.500 --> 40:21.567

I--I see it.

40:21.600 --> 40:23.100
- Tell me about it.
What's wrong with them?

40:23.100 --> 40:24.734
- First of all,
they don't sleep.

40:24.767 --> 40:27.100
- Because they see me
for two days.

40:27.133 --> 40:28.600
- Well, that's what's
even scarier,

40:28.633 --> 40:30.233
is you're gonna start
getting more time with them.

40:30.266 --> 40:33.033
Yeah.
- Whoa, dude.

and being,

40:41.100 --> 40:43.100

and loving her two children.

keep your composure?

like, my kids.

40:57.300 --> 40:59.233

they're more important than

40:59.266 --> 41:01.633

throwing accusations out there.

41:01.667 --> 41:05.100
- Cameran, as a new mom,
what was your reaction?

41:05.133 --> 41:07.200
- I didn't go to Hilton Head.
I watched as a viewer.

41:07.233 --> 41:09.066
And I just sat there
with my mouth wide open.

41:09.100 --> 41:12.600
I couldn't--
I couldn't believe it.

41:12.633 --> 41:15.667

went as far as to say

41:15.667 --> 41:18.133
that Thomas and Ashley
weren't allowed back

41:18.166 --> 41:20.266
in the house if
it made you feel uncomfortable.

41:20.266 --> 41:22.333
- Yeah.
And I--I appreciated that.

41:22.367 --> 41:24.266
I mean, it was scary
what happened.

41:24.266 --> 41:26.000
- I was terrified.

41:26.033 --> 41:27.633
I mean, there had come a point

41:27.667 --> 41:29.767
where I thought he was
gonna jump the bench.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.500
- Wait a second, hold on.
- Whoa.

41:31.533 --> 41:33.000
- Did you just say
that it's up to Kathryn

41:33.033 --> 41:34.266
if she can
stay in the house tonight?

41:34.300 --> 41:36.467
You have no say so.
- Okay.

41:36.500 --> 41:40.166
- So don't act like you do!
- Okay.

41:40.166 --> 41:42.166

didn't get involved.

41:44.133 --> 41:45.567
- Yeah, we did.
- No.

41:45.567 --> 41:47.567
- Yeah, we did. I told him--
- No, you didn't.

41:47.600 --> 41:50.033
- Well, we actually got
a lot of tweets from people

41:50.066 --> 41:51.700

didn't stand up.

He was like--

You just let her get yelled at

seen that coming?

Thomas was seeing red.

42:09.033 --> 42:10.667
You need to play that situation
very, very delicately.

enough that you try to just...

42:14.567 --> 42:16.300
I was like, "Oh, my God,
they're gonna fight."

42:16.333 --> 42:17.300
- Well, he did stand up. Yeah.
- "They're gonna fight."

42:17.300 --> 42:19.233
- Yeah, that was bad.

42:19.266 --> 42:21.066
- Kathryn, you said "This is
the real Thomas that I know."

42:21.100 --> 42:22.200

42:25.567 --> 42:28.033
he shows a side of him
where the mask falls.

42:28.066 --> 42:30.133

this person that

42:30.166 --> 42:32.066

42:32.066 --> 42:33.734
And he's, like,
foaming at the mouth.

42:33.734 --> 42:35.667
- He says the same about you.

42:35.700 --> 42:39.033
- It's not normal for a man
to speak to a woman like that.

42:39.066 --> 42:41.266
- He was worried about our saf--
where we were gonna stay--

42:41.300 --> 42:44.033
- There's no--there's nothing
you can say to defend--

42:44.066 --> 42:45.333
- Because he--I was
getting kicked out of the house,

42:45.367 --> 42:47.200
and he was protecting me.

42:47.233 --> 42:48.734
- And so--and so it was okay--
- He was worried about me.

42:48.734 --> 42:50.700
- For him to say "Shut
the (BLEEP) up" to Chelsea?

42:50.734 --> 42:52.433

in Thomas' rant.

44:36.300 --> 44:39.033
- Do you want me to lie
and say I didn't mean it?

44:42.367 --> 44:42.700
- We're back with the

44:42.700 --> 44:43.266
- We're back with the
"Southern Charm" reunion.

44:44.667 --> 44:47.233
Um, Jen from Valley Stream said,

44:47.266 --> 44:49.133
"Chelsea, I was
scared for you when Ashley

44:49.166 --> 44:51.033
kept repeating
your name on the staircase."

44:51.066 --> 44:52.433
- [laughs]
- "Were you freaking out?"

44:52.467 --> 44:54.567
- I mean, yeah.
- [laughs]

44:54.600 --> 44:56.533
- You gotta rip the Band-Aid
off at some point, Chelsea.

44:56.567 --> 44:59.000
I'm not going anywhere, Chelsea.
- I know, but I think--

44:59.033 --> 45:00.300
- Chelsea, everyone moves on.

45:00.333 --> 45:01.767
- Those children,
that's their mother.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.266
- I accept that.
- And you said some evil sh--

45:03.300 --> 45:04.567
about--about their mother.

45:04.567 --> 45:06.033
- Just because
you give birth, Chelsea,

45:06.033 --> 45:07.433
doesn't mean you're a mother.

45:07.467 --> 45:09.333
Chelsea.

45:09.367 --> 45:10.600
[dramatic musical flourish]

45:10.633 --> 45:13.133
- That's a horrible thing
to say.

45:13.166 --> 45:15.266
- I agree.

45:15.300 --> 45:19.133
I was being a bitch.

45:19.166 --> 45:22.066
- Um, Jackie
from San Diego said,

45:22.100 --> 45:24.333
"Ashley, I found it concerning
that you felt no remorse

45:24.333 --> 45:26.200
"after your outburst at dinner.

45:26.233 --> 45:28.567
A simple apology would have
defused that whole situation."

45:28.600 --> 45:31.600
Was anyone expecting an ack--
an acknowledgement

45:31.600 --> 45:33.467
or apology from Ashley
about that dinner?

45:33.500 --> 45:35.166
- I didn't think
they'd come back.

45:35.200 --> 45:36.533
I thought it was super weird.
- Yeah, look.

45:36.567 --> 45:38.200
You were kind of
emboldened by the whole thing.

45:38.233 --> 45:40.266
Like, you were like,
"Now it's us against the world."

45:40.300 --> 45:42.600
And you were kind of--I was
like, "Who is this person?"

45:42.600 --> 45:45.066
- Is there anything
that you said at that meal

45:45.066 --> 45:47.266
that you regret saying?

45:47.300 --> 45:50.633
- Absolutely.
- What?

45:50.667 --> 45:52.600
- I--I can't even--

45:52.633 --> 45:54.633
I'm--I'm trying to be
genuine here,

45:54.667 --> 45:55.633
okay?
- Kay.

45:55.667 --> 45:57.233
- I can't defend myself

45:57.266 --> 46:00.066
because my fav--
my behavior was indefensible.

46:00.100 --> 46:03.467
Okay?
And it was frightenly scary.

46:03.500 --> 46:06.467
I--I should have
pulled you aside somewhere else

46:06.500 --> 46:08.233
and had a private
conversation with you

46:08.266 --> 46:10.633
if I had any of these issues,
these problems.

46:10.667 --> 46:14.500
I picked the worst time,
worst place,

46:14.500 --> 46:16.233
and I apologize

46:16.266 --> 46:18.333
that I didn't pull you aside
if I had these feelings.

46:18.367 --> 46:20.200
- I'm glad that
you did what you did,

46:20.233 --> 46:21.333
because you showed
your true colors.

46:21.367 --> 46:22.700
- I was--I was wrong

46:22.734 --> 46:24.300
for the time and the place
that I did that.

46:24.333 --> 46:26.066
I was wrong.
I should never have--

46:26.100 --> 46:27.233
- See, time and place.
- Place, not what you did...

46:27.233 --> 46:28.734
- Yes.
- Or said?

46:28.767 --> 46:30.233
- Not content.
So time and place,

46:30.266 --> 46:31.600
but what about the content
of what you said?

46:31.633 --> 46:33.333
- I should never
have brought it up.

46:33.367 --> 46:34.633
But I'm not saying that
those aren't--weren't

46:34.667 --> 46:37.734
still feelings that I...
was feeling.

46:37.767 --> 46:39.400
- You know what really
hurts my feelings, is that

46:39.433 --> 46:41.233
you're not sorry
for what you said to me.

46:41.266 --> 46:42.767
- Right.
- That's the point.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
- It's that you say that
you believe what you said.

46:45.000 --> 46:46.633
- Yeah, you're saying
you're sorry you said it--

46:46.667 --> 46:48.533
- It was very hurtful.
- So it's a backhanded apology.

46:48.533 --> 46:51.266
- So you believe everything
you said at that meal?

46:51.266 --> 46:53.066
- Yes.
- You do?

46:53.100 --> 46:54.533
- [scoffs] There you go.

46:54.533 --> 46:56.367
- Do you want me to lie
and say I didn't mean it?

46:56.400 --> 46:58.400
- Do you receive your info
from one source, one person?

46:58.400 --> 47:00.133
- Yes, she does.
- Wow.

47:00.166 --> 47:01.400
- It's just brain--I mean, yeah.
- I know, it's sad.

47:01.433 --> 47:02.734
- You can't blame her;
she's brainwashed.

47:02.767 --> 47:04.500
- It's sad, Ashley,
it really is.

47:04.533 --> 47:06.667
- Did it surprise you
when you watched the show?

47:06.667 --> 47:09.133
He was selling you out
a little bit in his interviews.

47:09.166 --> 47:11.233
He was saying,
"This is driving me crazy.

47:11.266 --> 47:13.033
She won't stop
talking about this."

47:13.033 --> 47:16.400
- He said you were a dog
chasing a chew toy, didn't he?

47:16.433 --> 47:17.767
- He did.

47:18.000 --> 47:19.633
- There's nothing worse
than being excluded.

47:19.667 --> 47:21.233
- Yeah.

47:21.266 --> 47:22.433
I find it annoying
she can't drop it.

47:22.467 --> 47:25.166
Like a dog won't
let go of a shoe,

47:25.166 --> 47:26.567
a rubber shoe,
just [grunts]

47:26.600 --> 47:30.433
You know, just--
just let it go.

47:30.433 --> 47:32.367
- Were you surprised
when you saw that?

47:32.400 --> 47:33.700
- Yeah, I was.
- Was that a point of contention

47:33.734 --> 47:35.400
between the two of you?
- Absolutely.

47:35.433 --> 47:37.133
Absolutely, but he's in a--
he's--you know,

47:37.166 --> 47:38.266
he's stuck between
a rock and a hard place...

47:38.300 --> 47:39.767
- Right.

47:40.000 --> 47:41.433
- With the mother of his
children and his girlfriend.

47:41.467 --> 47:43.433
- So he was saying...
- Then don't be a rock.

47:43.467 --> 47:45.166
- I even think it was uncool
for you to be like,

47:45.200 --> 47:46.767
"Hey, I don't
have riding boots."

47:47.000 --> 47:48.567
And then he was like,
"Oh, well Kathryn has hers."

47:48.567 --> 47:50.000
- Yeah.
- I mean, it was like,

47:50.033 --> 47:51.367
not cool.
- He was baiting you.

47:51.400 --> 47:52.633
- Yeah, he said
a lot of messed-up stuff.

47:52.667 --> 47:54.266
- Yeah, but he does it
to get a reaction.

47:54.300 --> 47:56.033
- Yeah but that doesn't--
- That's ----ed up.

47:56.066 --> 47:57.567
That's not normal!
- Why are you okay with that?

47:57.600 --> 47:59.467
- I don't even think
you're aware of the fact that...

47:59.467 --> 48:01.066
- I am.
- He's baiting you.

48:01.066 --> 48:02.300
- It's just entertainment
to me, that's all.

48:02.333 --> 48:03.600
That's all.
That's all it is.

48:03.633 --> 48:05.200
- I think that's
what you tell yourself.

48:05.200 --> 48:06.667
- No, that's not what I--
- You--you think--

48:06.700 --> 48:08.333
he's baiting her?
- I think he's baiting her.

48:08.367 --> 48:10.033
- I think it's like
old Kathryn is right here.

48:10.066 --> 48:11.467
- It's the whole
Kathryn situation

48:11.500 --> 48:13.200
all over again.
- You know what, you guys?

48:13.233 --> 48:14.667
You don't know what happens
behind closed doors.

48:14.700 --> 48:16.600
- I do, 'cause that's
the same sh--

48:16.600 --> 48:18.066
- I can only imagine. It's gotta
be worse than what's on camera.

48:18.100 --> 48:20.200
If it's anything...
- Don't judge.

48:20.233 --> 48:21.667
Don't you dare judge
our relationship.

48:21.700 --> 48:23.066
- I am--
- You don't even know.

48:23.100 --> 48:24.166
- What are you talking about?

48:24.200 --> 48:25.700
You had a million cameras around

48:25.734 --> 48:27.266
and you acted deplorably.

48:27.300 --> 48:29.066
I mean, what's said
behind doors, good Lord.

48:29.100 --> 48:30.734
- Charleston's a small town,
Ashley.

48:30.767 --> 48:33.033
And from what we hear,
y'all do not have

48:33.066 --> 48:34.734
a happy, wonderful relationship.

48:34.767 --> 48:36.300
Like, from what we hear,

48:36.333 --> 48:38.100
it's pretty volatile
and not good.

48:38.100 --> 48:39.567
- And not your fault.

48:39.600 --> 48:41.500
- Chelsea heard he threw
some leftovers at you

48:41.500 --> 48:44.000
in front of
a restaurant recently.

48:47.500 --> 48:49.500
- No, he did not
throw it at me.

48:49.500 --> 48:53.633
He was upset because
I was leaving.

48:53.667 --> 48:55.567
And I handed him the food
and he was--

48:55.600 --> 48:57.200
I--I was being a brat.

48:57.233 --> 49:00.200
It was my fault.
I was being a brat.

49:01.467 --> 49:03.500
- You just took the blame
for him yelling at you.

49:03.500 --> 49:05.633
That's a horrible red flag.
- I think Ashley's--

49:05.667 --> 49:07.166
- First of all,
that's not fair because

49:07.200 --> 49:08.633
Thomas isn't here
to defend himself.

49:08.667 --> 49:09.734
- In any situation.
- It's a red flag, Ashley.

49:09.767 --> 49:11.367
- I got one question.

49:11.400 --> 49:13.333
So the things--the things
that were said to Kathryn,

49:13.367 --> 49:15.333
you're saying Patricia
gave you all that information.

49:15.367 --> 49:17.500
Thomas never said a bad word
about Kathryn to you.

49:17.500 --> 49:19.200
Is that--that can't be true.
- No.

49:19.233 --> 49:20.400
That's--of course.

49:20.400 --> 49:21.734
I've--I was hearing it from

49:21.767 --> 49:23.400
so many different people.
- Everywhere.

49:23.433 --> 49:24.667
- Okay.
- From everywhere.

49:24.667 --> 49:26.233
- But what does it say
about a man who

49:26.266 --> 49:29.467
talks poorly about
the mother of his children?

49:29.500 --> 49:32.266
And he has said
horrible things about you.

49:32.266 --> 49:33.667
About you.
- And on TV.

49:33.700 --> 49:35.266
- To everyone here.

49:35.300 --> 49:37.266
I mean, that--that
ought to make you feel like--

49:37.266 --> 49:39.266
that--that would kill me,
I mean...

49:39.300 --> 49:40.734
- No, because a lot has changed.

49:40.767 --> 49:43.000
- That's denial.
- But you--it's not denial.

49:43.033 --> 49:44.467
You're not with me.

49:44.500 --> 49:45.600
- You're watching him
tell Whitney how much

49:45.633 --> 49:47.600
it's gonna cost to ship you off.

49:47.633 --> 49:49.066
- And you don't look healthy.

49:49.100 --> 49:50.400
You're exactly
where Kathryn was.

49:50.400 --> 49:52.000
- You're lying to yourself,
Ashley.

49:52.033 --> 49:53.266
- Is this an intervention,
you guys?

49:53.266 --> 49:54.533
- It seems like.
- Kind of!

49:54.567 --> 49:56.266
- Yeah.
- Perhaps it's what it--

49:56.300 --> 49:57.533
- It's not against you.
- This is an oppor--no.

49:57.533 --> 49:59.266
We're--in a way,
we're kind of taking--

49:59.300 --> 50:01.033
- We're trying to help.
- Trust my judgment.

50:01.066 --> 50:02.700
- All right, that's fine.
- Please trust my judgment.

50:02.700 --> 50:04.166
- We haven't seen--
- Please know.

50:04.200 --> 50:05.767
That's all.
- Let me ask you this.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.266
Does it not
give you cause for pause

50:08.300 --> 50:11.166
that they've all kind of seen
this before with someone else?

50:11.200 --> 50:13.033
- We've all seen it.
- I feel bad for you.

50:13.033 --> 50:15.500
And I'm watching you
be me years ago.

50:15.533 --> 50:16.567
And, I mean, I'm watching it
unfold right before me.

50:16.567 --> 50:18.100
- And it's not just her.

50:18.133 --> 50:21.767
It's how he's been a...
a not a nice person.

50:22.000 --> 50:25.166
- I know, and we--we
all have our bad moments, okay?

50:25.200 --> 50:27.000
A lot has changed.
- Ashley, I think you are...

50:27.033 --> 50:28.300
- There's a lot that's happened
in the last few months.

50:28.333 --> 50:29.500
- We're just
looking out for you.

50:29.533 --> 50:31.000
That's all.
- Thank you.

50:31.033 --> 50:32.166
- Telling yourself these things.
- No.

50:32.200 --> 50:33.567
You're wrong.
- It's crazy.

50:33.600 --> 50:34.633
It's like the twilight zone.
- Save yourself.

50:34.667 --> 50:36.233
And go back to California.

50:36.266 --> 50:38.433
And give yourself
a nice life while you can.

50:38.433 --> 50:41.200
- All right.
We need to take a break.

50:41.233 --> 50:42.533
We'll be right back.

50:42.567 --> 50:44.200
Coming up...

50:44.200 --> 50:46.700
- You are an unkind,
hateful, sadistic person.

50:46.734 --> 50:49.333
And, unfortunately,
if you need to have this message

50:49.367 --> 50:52.667
delivered to you like this,
I will deliver it.

50:56.400 --> 50:57.000
- Well, it took five years,

50:58.600 --> 51:00.533
but Patricia finally
extended an olive branch

51:00.567 --> 51:03.300
and invited Kathryn
to her winter ball.

51:03.333 --> 51:05.700
Uh, you two have had
a very public feud

51:05.734 --> 51:07.266
for five years.

51:07.300 --> 51:09.467
What do you think
actually started it?

51:09.467 --> 51:11.467
- Now that I'm a mom,

51:11.467 --> 51:14.200
I feel like perhaps
whenever I attacked Whitney

51:14.233 --> 51:16.033
and told him
to fall on a knife...

51:16.066 --> 51:17.600
- Relax.
You--you should relax.

51:17.600 --> 51:21.066
- You should go home and
take lessons from your mother.

51:21.100 --> 51:22.467
- You should go to bed.

51:22.500 --> 51:23.567
- Who obviously
didn't raise you right.

51:23.600 --> 51:25.033
- You should go to bed.

51:25.066 --> 51:27.567
- Uh, you should go
fall on a knife.

51:27.600 --> 51:30.633
Uh, probably didn't
go over so well with her.

51:30.633 --> 51:33.633
- Have you and Patricia
been in touch since the ball?

51:33.633 --> 51:35.600
- We have.
- Really?

51:35.633 --> 51:37.700
- I actually ran into her
at a restaurant.

51:37.734 --> 51:40.033
And one of the waiters
came up and said that

51:40.066 --> 51:42.066
"Miss Altschul's downstairs.
She'd like to speak with you."

51:42.100 --> 51:43.600
I was like, "(BLEEP)."

51:43.633 --> 51:45.367
[laughter]

51:45.400 --> 51:46.767
And I went down
and I sat with her,

51:47.000 --> 51:49.200
and she just said,
"I want to apologize

51:49.233 --> 51:53.166
"to you because
now that I have seen you

51:53.200 --> 51:55.200
"transform--I've heard
a lot of things from Whitney.

51:55.233 --> 51:57.433
"I feel really, really bad
for having, like,

51:57.467 --> 51:59.767
said the things I said
without getting to know you."

51:59.767 --> 52:01.367
- Wow.

52:01.367 --> 52:02.767
- I mean, I'm pretty close
with Patricia.

52:02.767 --> 52:05.133
And off-camera
Patricia genuinely does

52:05.133 --> 52:06.500
feel sorry and...
- Mm-hmm.

52:06.533 --> 52:08.667
- She looks at Kathryn
in a new light.

52:08.667 --> 52:10.266
- Naomie, tell me about

52:10.266 --> 52:12.266
the rumor that
you heard about Ashley.

52:12.300 --> 52:15.600
- Thomas and Ashley are here.
Are they together? Not together?

52:15.633 --> 52:18.066
What's the deal?
- There's a rumor.

52:18.100 --> 52:19.333
- She's pregnant?

52:19.367 --> 52:20.767
- No.
- Oh, God.

52:21.000 --> 52:22.400
- Go the opposite tree.
- Opposite direction.

52:22.433 --> 52:25.000
- [gasps]
She's a, um, an escort?

52:25.033 --> 52:26.133
- Yeah.
- [yelps]

52:26.166 --> 52:27.600
- A what?
What'd you say?

52:27.633 --> 52:29.600
- Politically correct term,
Cameran, I love it.

52:29.633 --> 52:33.767
- Calling someone an escort
is a pretty serious allegation.

52:34.000 --> 52:35.734
- To be honest, I had
literally no problem doing it

52:35.767 --> 52:38.767
because her behavior
was just so...

52:39.000 --> 52:42.100
I mean...
Yeah.

52:42.133 --> 52:45.400
My roommate has friends
in Santa Barbara,

52:45.400 --> 52:47.000
and he has asked them
who is Ashley?

52:47.033 --> 52:51.367
And they...
might have mentioned that.

52:55.300 --> 52:57.033
Why are you looking at me
like that?

52:57.033 --> 52:59.133
- That's disgusting.
Shame on you.

52:59.166 --> 53:01.166
I--
Shame on you.

53:01.166 --> 53:04.266
- So, Austen, why tell Thomas?

53:04.300 --> 53:07.100
- Women can be nasty,
you know, but, they're like,

53:07.133 --> 53:08.767
"I think Ashley
is like an escort."

53:09.000 --> 53:11.433
[dramatic music]

53:11.433 --> 53:14.367
- Well, that's not true.
No.

53:14.400 --> 53:16.567
- I had heard it
from several people.

53:16.567 --> 53:18.166
And if someone was saying that

53:18.200 --> 53:19.700
about my girlfriend,
I would want to know.

53:19.700 --> 53:21.166
- Did you believe it
when you heard it?

53:21.166 --> 53:23.100
- I...

53:23.133 --> 53:24.433
- She hasn't been working.

53:24.433 --> 53:26.166
And--and then he said,
"I have also heard."

53:26.166 --> 53:28.200
And I was like, "Okay, well,
like what's up with that?"

53:28.233 --> 53:29.734
- And I know exactly
where that started.

53:29.767 --> 53:31.467
It came from the person
that Thomas rejected.

53:31.500 --> 53:32.734
- The ex-girlfriend?
- Correct.

53:32.734 --> 53:34.266
- I was told by Thomas

53:34.300 --> 53:35.734
you signed some kind of NDA.

53:35.767 --> 53:37.600
So it all just seems
very business-like.

53:37.633 --> 53:39.066
Just throwing it out there.

53:39.100 --> 53:41.000
- You think it's
a business relationship?

53:41.033 --> 53:42.300
- Well, I don't know.
I don't know what it is.

53:42.333 --> 53:43.600
But there's question marks.
- No.

53:43.633 --> 53:45.266
What are--where is this
coming from?

53:45.300 --> 53:47.066
- He's told me that
you've signed an NDA.

53:47.100 --> 53:48.433
- Where is this gossip
coming from?

53:48.467 --> 53:49.734
- Thomas. Thomas.
- God, you're a liar.

53:49.734 --> 53:52.333
- I based--
- You are such a liar.

53:52.367 --> 53:54.033
I'm just repeating what you say.

53:54.066 --> 53:55.467
- I wonder if he's scared

53:55.467 --> 53:57.467
that she would, like,
testify against him.

53:57.467 --> 53:59.333
He's let her get so close--

53:59.367 --> 54:01.300
or too close,
that now he's just got to

54:01.333 --> 54:03.600
deal with it, pay the rent,
and keep her here,

54:03.600 --> 54:05.433
because he doesn't know
what she'll do.

54:05.467 --> 54:07.333
So I didn't know if you
had ever threatened to, like,

54:07.367 --> 54:09.467
you know, testify against...
- Never. I would never do that.

54:09.467 --> 54:11.600
I--I'm better than that.
- Back then. Then why are you--

54:11.633 --> 54:13.100
- It doesn't matter.
I have a conscience.

54:13.100 --> 54:14.433
I'm a good--
I would never do that.

54:14.467 --> 54:15.600
- So why didn't he
break up with you?

54:15.633 --> 54:17.166
- Why didn't he
break up with me?

54:17.200 --> 54:18.333
We never broke up.
- No, why didn't he?

54:18.367 --> 54:19.600
- Why didn't he, he's saying.

54:19.633 --> 54:20.767
- Oh, why didn't
he break up with me?

54:20.767 --> 54:22.367
- Why didn't you
break up with him?

54:22.367 --> 54:24.033
- Because...
- That's what I would have done.

54:24.066 --> 54:25.367
- We see each other's
hearts and who we really are.

54:25.400 --> 54:27.233
- She should be
breaking up with him.

54:27.233 --> 54:28.633
- No, because there's more than
what you guys don't see.

54:28.633 --> 54:30.233
- He told me
he doesn't want to leave you

54:30.266 --> 54:31.700
because he doesn't trust
that you won't

54:31.734 --> 54:33.367
go to the media
and do something.

54:33.400 --> 54:35.033
- It's bizarre.
- I also feel, though,

54:35.066 --> 54:36.767
that you might be crazy enough

54:36.767 --> 54:39.633
to threaten him
if he were to break up with you.

54:39.633 --> 54:41.100
- Well, you would know, Kathryn.

54:41.133 --> 54:42.700
It takes one to know one,
doesn't it?

54:42.734 --> 54:44.367
- I mean, I was shocked.

54:44.367 --> 54:46.100
I looked on your social media
the other day.

54:46.133 --> 54:48.367
I was like, "Surely
they're not still together."

54:48.367 --> 54:50.367
Because it seemed like
you were about to break up

54:50.367 --> 54:52.266
25 times on the show.

54:52.266 --> 54:54.633
- Said, "Look, do I need to
send you back to California?

54:54.667 --> 54:56.533
'Cause I'm not gonna
put up with this crap."

54:56.567 --> 54:58.533
And when you come back, you'll
be a better person for it.

54:58.533 --> 55:01.633
- If I do come back.
- Go ahead.

55:01.667 --> 55:04.533
Maybe we should just
call it quits.

55:04.533 --> 55:06.400
- [scoffs] Oh, my God.

55:06.400 --> 55:08.400
- Like, he was about to go break
up with you in front of us.

55:08.400 --> 55:10.133
- Okay, was this six months ago?
Seven months ago, five--

55:10.133 --> 55:11.266
- It doesn't matter when it was.
- No.

55:11.266 --> 55:12.667
A lot has changed since then.

55:12.700 --> 55:14.200
- No, but in that moment.
- Okay.

55:14.233 --> 55:15.266
I don't know.
That was--

55:15.266 --> 55:17.000
it was a crazy time for me.

55:17.000 --> 55:18.734
I wasn't even happy
in my own life at that time.

55:18.767 --> 55:21.200
I didn't know where my place
in this world was in that time.

55:21.233 --> 55:23.000
- So Ashley--
- I'm very secure now.

55:23.033 --> 55:25.667
And you're not gonna be
invited to our wedding.

55:25.700 --> 55:27.400
[laughter]

55:27.400 --> 55:29.767
- Who here will be invited
to your wedding?

55:30.000 --> 55:31.567
Anyone?

55:34.734 --> 55:36.300
- You, Andy.

55:36.333 --> 55:38.000
- Thank you.
- Will you officiate, please?

55:38.033 --> 55:40.033
- [soft laugh] I w--
- [laughs] Oh, God.

55:40.033 --> 55:42.166
- Um, Ashley, uh,

55:42.200 --> 55:44.533
you went outside to apologize
at the ball.

55:44.567 --> 55:48.166
And, uh, it quickly turned into

55:48.200 --> 55:50.433
a nasty brawl.

55:50.433 --> 55:52.133
What happened?

55:52.166 --> 55:55.233
- Yeah, I actually went down
with, you know...

55:55.266 --> 55:56.433
- Pure intentions.
- With the intentions--

55:56.433 --> 55:58.266
yes, pure intentions.

55:58.300 --> 56:00.667
- If those were your intentions,
then what changed?

56:00.700 --> 56:02.567
'Cause when you sat down,
I mean,

56:02.567 --> 56:04.133
you said even worse things to me

56:04.166 --> 56:05.767
than you said to me
in Hilton Head.

56:06.000 --> 56:07.700
- Don't forget your kids
were taken away from you.

56:07.700 --> 56:09.300
Don't forget that.
Just be careful.

56:09.333 --> 56:11.166
'Cause I know
a lot of information.

56:11.200 --> 56:13.433
- You're threatening me.
- Yeah, I am.

56:13.433 --> 56:15.433
Baby mama, stay out of it.

56:15.467 --> 56:18.066
Go to find someone else
to go screw.

56:18.100 --> 56:19.734
You're not a family.
- We are a family.

56:19.767 --> 56:20.734
- No, you're a baby mama.

56:20.767 --> 56:22.533
Go.
- Thomas...

56:22.567 --> 56:23.567
- You're nothing
but an egg donor.

56:23.600 --> 56:25.667
[dramatic music pounds]

56:25.700 --> 56:27.266
- So you believe that Kathryn

56:27.300 --> 56:28.700
is nothing more
than an egg donor?

56:28.734 --> 56:32.066
- No.
I--I--I apologize for that.

56:32.066 --> 56:33.467
- Well, what made you
feel that way?

56:33.500 --> 56:35.266
- I felt attacked.

56:35.300 --> 56:36.600
- Attacked? You attacked me.
- Yeah.

56:36.633 --> 56:38.200
You followed--
you chased after us.

56:38.200 --> 56:40.066
- No, you walked away.
You were like,

56:40.066 --> 56:41.467
"Thomas, I'm gonna take you."
- Exactly! We walked away.

56:41.467 --> 56:43.133
- And I was so offended...
- We walked away.

56:43.166 --> 56:44.467
- And I had taken it
and taken it from you,

56:44.467 --> 56:46.133
so much sh--,
said, you know what?

56:46.166 --> 56:47.600
I want to say you to,
and I'll say it again,

56:47.633 --> 56:50.533
as a mother, (BLEEP) you
for saying that sh--.

56:50.567 --> 56:53.066
It's not okay
to say to any mother, ever.

56:53.100 --> 56:54.600
And to just keep saying it

56:54.633 --> 56:58.200
is so hurtful
and just beyond disrespectful,

56:58.233 --> 57:00.767
I just feel bad for you that
you can't even see that.

57:00.767 --> 57:02.233
And I hope that one day

57:02.233 --> 57:03.767
if you are ever a mother,

57:04.000 --> 57:05.100
you learn this.

57:05.100 --> 57:06.367
'Cause I don't know what else

57:06.400 --> 57:08.500
would teach you,
I have no idea.

57:08.500 --> 57:10.300
It is so hurtful.

57:10.333 --> 57:12.233
Those are my children.
You're around them.

57:12.266 --> 57:13.734
You're taking videos of them.

57:13.767 --> 57:15.767
And you say these things
about me and to me,

57:16.000 --> 57:17.433
that is disturbing.

57:17.467 --> 57:19.033
- I agree, Kathryn.
- It is so disturbing.

57:19.066 --> 57:20.166
- But I also don't agree
with a lot of things

57:20.200 --> 57:21.367
that you did in the past, okay?

57:21.400 --> 57:22.700
- You don't know
anything about me

57:22.734 --> 57:24.433
in the past at all.
- Oh, really?

57:24.467 --> 57:26.200
Oh, I don't know that you
lost custody of your children?

57:26.233 --> 57:27.633
- Well everyone kind of does.
- So what--is that--

57:27.667 --> 57:29.200
- That's the past.
- You're blaming her for...

57:29.233 --> 57:30.700
- No. No.
- Losing custody of her kids?

57:30.734 --> 57:32.233
- Yes.
- I'm just saying that...

57:32.233 --> 57:33.567
- Yes.
- There's still things that

57:33.600 --> 57:35.433
I know, Kathryn,
that you're saying this

57:35.467 --> 57:37.033
and you're preaching to me--
- I'm not preaching to you.

57:37.066 --> 57:38.667
- I hope I never lose custody
of my children.

57:38.667 --> 57:40.533
- Let me ask you this.
You've known her for how long?

57:40.533 --> 57:42.266
A year, basically?

57:42.266 --> 57:43.533
- No, not even that long.

57:43.567 --> 57:45.266
- Less than that.
- Less than a year?

57:45.266 --> 57:47.333
So in the time
that you've known her,

57:47.367 --> 57:50.233
are there things
that she has done

57:50.266 --> 57:53.533
that would bring you
to the point of saying,

57:53.567 --> 57:55.600
"You're nothing more
than an egg donor"?

57:55.633 --> 57:58.066
Or are you judging her
by things that

57:58.100 --> 57:59.767
you've been told about her past?

58:00.000 --> 58:01.133
- By Thomas.

58:01.133 --> 58:02.467
- By Thomas.
- Yes.

58:02.500 --> 58:04.266
- Yes.

58:04.266 --> 58:05.533
But I would really love

58:05.567 --> 58:07.767
to try to make it right
with you, Kathryn.

58:08.000 --> 58:09.600
I really would love that.

58:09.633 --> 58:11.367
- Things that have been said
are too bad to turn back from.

58:11.400 --> 58:13.233
- You just said--but you don't
want me to be a liar either.

58:13.266 --> 58:14.500
- So--okay,
that's the whole point.

58:14.533 --> 58:15.667
- That's the point.
- Okay.

58:15.667 --> 58:17.066
But that's why--
- You're saying--

58:17.100 --> 58:18.533
that's--that's their point.

58:18.533 --> 58:20.166
You've--you've said that

58:20.166 --> 58:21.567
you still believe
the things that you've said.

58:21.600 --> 58:22.667
- No, but that's why I need
to have

58:22.700 --> 58:24.433
this conversation with Kathryn.

58:24.467 --> 58:26.033
- You may have said everything
that there is to say.

58:26.033 --> 58:27.166
- So you wait until
you're on TV, huh?

58:27.166 --> 58:28.533
Mm.
- What do you mean?

58:28.567 --> 58:30.033
- You want to hear
Kathryn's side of the story?

58:30.066 --> 58:31.567
Basically, is that what you're--
- Ever?

58:31.600 --> 58:33.000
- No, I don't want to hear
her side of the story.

58:33.033 --> 58:34.567
But I would---
- Oh, my God.

58:34.600 --> 58:35.633
- I would just, like--
I think that we can relate

58:35.667 --> 58:36.667
to each other.

58:36.700 --> 58:38.000
- What we're suggesting is

58:38.033 --> 58:40.500
that you try to seek out

58:40.533 --> 58:43.033
other information other
than from Thomas at this moment,

58:43.033 --> 58:44.700
and you start
to maybe reevaluate
