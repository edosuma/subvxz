00:02.089 --> 00:04.091
<i>The popularity
and cultural impact</i>

00:04.091 --> 00:07.181
<i>of comic books in our time
cannot be overstated.</i>

00:07.181 --> 00:11.402
<i>Superheroes were out, horror
and crime comics were in,</i>

00:11.402 --> 00:13.709
<i>and me and my friends
were obsessed.</i>

00:13.709 --> 00:14.579
What the hell?

00:19.323 --> 00:20.324
You've got to be kidding me.

00:23.893 --> 00:26.330
Guys, you're not
gonna believe this.

00:26.330 --> 00:28.680
Do you remember
when I submitted my story
to Pep Comics

00:28.680 --> 00:32.249
and I received that asinine
form rejection letter?

00:32.249 --> 00:36.775
Well, they stole my story,
and published it.

00:36.775 --> 00:39.082
Stole it? You mean
word for word?

00:39.082 --> 00:41.824
Well, not word for word,
but it's definitely my story.

00:41.824 --> 00:43.782
Well, I should sue 'em, right?

00:43.782 --> 00:45.523
Can you prove
it was your story?

00:45.523 --> 00:47.395
Maybe start by
giving them a call.

00:47.395 --> 00:49.571
Oh, shucks to that.

00:49.571 --> 00:51.834
Pep Comics is right here
in town. I'm gonna
go pay 'em a visit.

00:52.922 --> 00:53.836
Who's with me?

00:59.102 --> 01:01.235
Good morning, Riverdalians.

01:01.235 --> 01:04.673
Let's begin with the most
exciting news ever,

01:04.673 --> 01:06.936
<i>which is that the
entertainment committee,</i>

01:06.936 --> 01:10.679
<i>chaired by yours truly,
is hosting its first
dance of the year.</i>

01:10.679 --> 01:13.725
Our annual sock hop
taking place this Friday night.

01:13.725 --> 01:16.032
<i>As is customary, no shoes will
be allowed on the gym floor.</i>

01:16.032 --> 01:18.556
<i>So, boys, before you ask
your best girls out,</i>

01:18.556 --> 01:21.994
<i>make sure that your
socks match and that
they don't have any holes.</i>

01:21.994 --> 01:26.390
<i>In short, the whole event
is sure to be the bee's knees
and the cat's pajamas.</i>

01:26.390 --> 01:28.262
<i>Tickets will be
on sale all week,</i>

01:28.262 --> 01:30.264
<i>and you'll want to snap them up
early as I can now confirm</i>

01:30.264 --> 01:32.701
<i>that Kevin and the Crooners
will be headlining.</i>

01:33.702 --> 01:35.095
<i>See you all there.</i>

01:38.010 --> 01:41.449
Hey, Veronica?

01:41.449 --> 01:44.626
I was wondering if you wanted
to go to the sock hop with me.

01:46.018 --> 01:47.281
That depends.

01:47.281 --> 01:48.195
Can you cut a rug?

01:50.022 --> 01:50.936
Are you a good dancer?

01:52.547 --> 01:54.549
Oh, yeah, of course I am.

01:54.549 --> 01:56.246
Well, I'm sure I believe you,

01:56.246 --> 01:57.900
but I'm still going to need
a demonstration, daddy-o.

02:03.384 --> 02:06.822
Toni Topaz. Here to buy your
ticket to the sock hop, I hope.

02:06.822 --> 02:08.519
That depends.

02:08.519 --> 02:10.130
Are you asking me out?

02:10.130 --> 02:12.654
What? Why, of course not.

02:12.654 --> 02:14.699
No, I'm...
I am hosting the dance.

02:14.699 --> 02:17.006
I couldn't possibly
be saddled with a date.

02:17.006 --> 02:19.748
Not to mention that you're...
And I'm also...

02:19.748 --> 02:22.359
- Um, and girls don't--
- Don't what?

02:22.359 --> 02:24.492
Dance with other girls?

02:24.492 --> 02:26.407
Calm down, Peggy Sue.

02:26.407 --> 02:28.800
No, I'm not buying a ticket.

02:28.800 --> 02:33.065
My pal Fangs here
is a singer,
and we were hoping

02:33.065 --> 02:35.459
that you could give him a shot
at playing at the sock hop.

02:35.459 --> 02:36.939
You should add
him to the lineup.

02:36.939 --> 02:39.159
And the Serpents
will be there in full force.

02:39.159 --> 02:42.901
Hmm, and start a rumble
as greasers are wont to do?

02:42.901 --> 02:45.034
No, thank you.

02:45.034 --> 02:46.557
Kevin and the Crooners
will be performing,
as previously announced.

02:46.557 --> 02:48.559
Well, we offered.

02:48.559 --> 02:51.214
Good luck selling tickets
with that B-grade
barbershop quartet.

02:53.651 --> 02:54.652
Later, Midge.

03:06.925 --> 03:10.364
Okay, Bernie, who's the kid?

03:10.364 --> 03:14.672
He's a writer, Al.
Says we stole
one of his stories.

03:14.672 --> 03:15.586
All right, come on in.

03:16.805 --> 03:18.067
Tell me your tale of woe.

03:21.984 --> 03:25.683
So you're accusing me
of what, exactly?

03:25.683 --> 03:29.034
Well, I submitted a story,
then you rejected it.

03:29.034 --> 03:32.299
And then, surprise, surprise,

03:32.299 --> 03:35.824
you ran a story
that was exactly like it.

03:35.824 --> 03:38.740
Now, you might call that
a coincidence, but I...

03:39.741 --> 03:41.177
call it theft.

03:41.177 --> 03:43.005
Well, I hate to burst
your bubble, kid,

03:43.005 --> 03:45.616
but, uh,
I got news for you.

03:45.616 --> 03:47.792
There are no original ideas.

03:47.792 --> 03:50.578
I mean, I get hundreds
of submissions every week.

03:50.578 --> 03:52.536
It's all the same slop.

03:52.536 --> 03:55.800
But the timing, the details.

03:55.800 --> 03:58.325
Oh, you want proof?

03:58.325 --> 04:02.503
These filing cabinets here,
they're filled with every
single story germ I ever had.

04:02.503 --> 04:05.070
I got a backlog just waiting
to be farmed out

04:05.070 --> 04:08.857
to any hack
who can string together
a semi-coherent sentence.

04:08.857 --> 04:10.162
Waiting?

04:10.162 --> 04:11.381
Like you're looking
for writers?

04:11.381 --> 04:13.470
- Always.
- Well, I'm a writer.

04:15.690 --> 04:18.432
If I wanted to be considered,
what would I have to do?

04:18.432 --> 04:21.870
Well, first off, drop
the persecution complex.

04:21.870 --> 04:24.351
Listen, take this log line.

04:24.351 --> 04:26.875
Turn it into a seven-page story
by tomorrow morning.

04:26.875 --> 04:29.051
And if it doesn't make me
want to puke, we'll talk.

04:32.315 --> 04:34.883
<i>Thanks for helping
me out of this jam, Betty.</i>

04:34.883 --> 04:37.277
I panicked, told Veronica
that I can dance

04:37.277 --> 04:39.931
when the truth is,
I got two left feet.

04:39.931 --> 04:42.456
You remember when
I broke Midge's big toe
doing the bunny hop.

04:42.456 --> 04:45.328
I do.
But don't worry.

04:45.328 --> 04:48.505
We will start with something
simple and classic.

04:48.505 --> 04:49.419
The twist.

04:55.730 --> 04:58.994
Okay, so start just by

04:58.994 --> 05:02.302
moving your hips
from side to side like this.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.172
Try it.

05:07.307 --> 05:10.353
- Like this?
- No, less of shoulders,
more hips.

05:14.009 --> 05:14.923
Okay.

05:19.623 --> 05:21.669
Like this? I can't...

05:21.669 --> 05:25.368
No. Maybe you just need
to focus on slow dancing.

05:25.368 --> 05:26.935
Everyone knows
how to slow dance.

05:32.462 --> 05:33.333
Okay.

05:34.899 --> 05:36.727
One hand goes like this.

05:38.033 --> 05:40.165
The other hand, here.

05:41.993 --> 05:43.168
And then you just sway.

05:43.168 --> 05:45.127
<i>♪ For the rest of my life ♪</i>

05:48.739 --> 05:49.653
That's it?

05:51.133 --> 05:53.527
Yeah, it's
pretty simple, right?

05:53.527 --> 05:56.268
<i>♪ I can put aside
My foolish pride ♪</i>

05:56.268 --> 06:00.360
<i>♪ I'm begging you, please ♪</i>

06:00.360 --> 06:04.146
<i>♪ Be mine ♪</i>

06:07.497 --> 06:12.372
<i>♪ Be mine ♪</i>

06:12.372 --> 06:14.809
<i>♪ For the rest of my life... ♪</i>

06:16.332 --> 06:20.205
And what
exactly is going on here?

06:20.205 --> 06:21.424
Betty was just
showing me some moves,
Mrs. Cooper.

06:21.424 --> 06:22.991
I'm giving Archie
a dance lesson.

06:22.991 --> 06:25.428
He's asking out the new girl.

06:25.428 --> 06:26.864
She's a celebrity
from Hollywood.

06:26.864 --> 06:27.822
Goodbye, Archie.

06:28.953 --> 06:30.564
Bye, Betty.

06:30.564 --> 06:32.609
Goodbye, Mrs. Cooper.

06:32.609 --> 06:35.133
Oh, thank your
sweet mother for agreeing
to chaperone with me.

06:37.440 --> 06:40.182
Give me
your expert opinion, Ethel.
I can take it.

06:40.182 --> 06:42.880
I'm so jealous of you, Jughead.

06:42.880 --> 06:46.797
It's my life's goal to draw
a story for Pep Comics.

06:46.797 --> 06:49.278
They... They work with some
of the best artists in the biz.

06:49.278 --> 06:53.151
Oh, come on. You're as good
as any of those clowns, Ethel.

06:53.151 --> 06:56.067
I'll tell you what. If I can
finish these pages
and really make them sing,

06:56.067 --> 06:58.200
then I'll put your name forward
to Mr. Fieldstone tomorrow.

06:58.200 --> 06:59.549
He's our editor-in-chief.

06:59.549 --> 07:01.551
Really?

07:01.551 --> 07:04.772
Jughead, that would...
That would be a dream.

07:04.772 --> 07:06.730
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Well...

07:08.210 --> 07:09.429
Let's see what he says first.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.972
Yoo-hoo! Sorry to interrupt.

07:30.972 --> 07:33.453
Just wanted to make sure
that everyone had their
tickets to the sock hop.

07:36.978 --> 07:39.589
Midge Klump? One
of my precious Vixens

07:39.589 --> 07:42.244
with a common greaser?
Sacrilege!

07:42.244 --> 07:43.811
You get out of that car
right this minute!

07:43.811 --> 07:45.421
Calm down! I'm coming.

07:45.421 --> 07:47.031
Go!

07:57.128 --> 07:58.478
Is everything okay, Kev?

08:00.610 --> 08:01.524
Yeah, sure.

08:01.524 --> 08:03.004
Just a little...

08:03.004 --> 08:05.485
preoccupied, I guess.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.878
Thinking about what songs
you're gonna sing
at the sock hop?

08:09.445 --> 08:13.623
Yeah. Yeah, and other things.

08:13.623 --> 08:16.974
You know, you haven't
officially asked me
to the sock hop yet.

08:18.323 --> 08:22.110
Oh, uh, well, I'm performing.

08:22.110 --> 08:25.548
So I just kind of assumed
you'd come to, you know,

08:26.418 --> 08:27.245
cheer me on.

08:29.639 --> 08:31.467
Right, yeah, of course.
That makes sense.

08:41.608 --> 08:43.000
Um...

08:43.000 --> 08:44.741
What is it?
Don't you like kissing me?

08:44.741 --> 08:47.875
Of course.
It's like I said, I'm...
I'm performing

08:47.875 --> 08:50.573
and I don't want to risk
catching a cold.

08:50.573 --> 08:53.097
It's always
something with you.

08:54.403 --> 08:55.752
What is that supposed to mean?

08:55.752 --> 08:57.101
It means we've
been dating for months

08:57.101 --> 09:00.322
and we're still not
going steady.

09:00.322 --> 09:02.933
You haven't even
pinned me yet.

09:02.933 --> 09:04.326
How am I supposed to pin you?

09:04.326 --> 09:05.719
I don't even
play a varsity sport--

09:05.719 --> 09:07.677
Doesn't need to be
a varsity pin, Kev.

09:07.677 --> 09:09.549
It can be any old pin.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.028
Can be a ring, even.

09:11.028 --> 09:12.943
Gosh, when did you become
such a sex maniac?

09:14.031 --> 09:16.556
For your information,

09:16.556 --> 09:18.688
the fact that I want
my supposed boyfriend

09:18.688 --> 09:23.214
to kiss me once every blue moon
does not make me a sex maniac,

09:23.214 --> 09:26.130
and I do not have
cold germs or cooties,

09:26.130 --> 09:29.394
and I will definitely
not be cheering you on
at the sock hop.

09:29.394 --> 09:31.135
Betty... Betty.

09:48.457 --> 09:52.069
Well, it's pretentious, clunky,
too much dialogue.

09:52.069 --> 09:54.594
But it'll do.

09:54.594 --> 09:55.638
Bernie, get in here.

09:57.161 --> 09:59.250
Wha...

09:59.250 --> 10:01.383
Yes, Mr. Fieldstone.
We got a live one here.

10:01.383 --> 10:04.821
Now, see who's available to
draw a seven-page zombie story

10:04.821 --> 10:06.475
for immediate publication.

10:08.433 --> 10:11.219
So, I'm hired?

10:11.219 --> 10:13.438
A dollar a page.
Take it or leave it.

10:13.438 --> 10:17.181
Yeah, I'll take it.
And, um, I know an artist,
an incredible artist.

10:17.181 --> 10:21.098
Young, hungry, cheap,
loves monster movies.

10:21.098 --> 10:23.797
A real fiend for gore.

10:23.797 --> 10:25.625
Okay.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.496
But I want those pages tomorrow.

10:27.496 --> 10:28.453
Yeah, you'll have 'em.

10:29.106 --> 10:31.587
And, um...

10:31.587 --> 10:33.371
Thank you for everything,
Mr. Fieldstone.

10:52.477 --> 10:54.218
Sorry, um...

10:54.218 --> 10:55.611
I... I didn't know
the music room
was reserved.

10:55.611 --> 10:57.874
It's not. I was just
horsing around,

10:57.874 --> 11:00.485
but you probably need it
to rehearse, I'm guessing.

11:00.485 --> 11:02.313
Uh, my set
for the sock hop, yeah.

11:03.837 --> 11:06.187
You're Clay Walker, right?

11:06.187 --> 11:09.146
I am. Just
transferred this year.

11:09.146 --> 11:11.888
And you're Kevin Keller.
Son of the sheriff,

11:11.888 --> 11:13.498
dating the prettiest girl
at Riverdale High.

11:15.849 --> 11:18.025
I've done my research.

11:18.025 --> 11:20.810
Uh, where did you
transfer from?

11:20.810 --> 11:24.379
All over. My dad's in the...
Was in the military.

11:25.510 --> 11:27.599
Cool. Cool.

11:29.732 --> 11:31.299
Are you going to the sock hop?

11:31.299 --> 11:34.041
I wouldn't have a date.
I don't know many people.

11:36.217 --> 11:40.395
Unless, uh, you could think
of someone I should ask.

11:43.441 --> 11:44.965
A lot of people go stag here.

11:48.795 --> 11:49.709
It's nice to meet you.

12:02.809 --> 12:07.770
Hey. Uh, so I did
a little brushing up

12:07.770 --> 12:12.601
and I'm ready
for that demonstration.

12:12.601 --> 12:13.733
How do you feel
about slow dancing?

12:15.996 --> 12:17.780
Nothing better.

12:17.780 --> 12:20.609
But upon further reflection,

12:20.609 --> 12:23.873
I have no doubt
a Troy Donahue type
like you

12:23.873 --> 12:25.701
can trip the light
fantastic, Archie.

12:27.572 --> 12:30.184
So does that mean...

12:30.184 --> 12:32.490
But, quite candidly,

12:32.490 --> 12:34.318
I'm also entertaining
other offers.

12:35.972 --> 12:37.495
What? Oh...

12:38.148 --> 12:39.889
Wow, okay.

12:39.889 --> 12:43.719
However, being my escort
demands more than mere dancing.

12:43.719 --> 12:47.157
It also requires
scintillating conversation.

12:47.157 --> 12:49.725
I need to know that you won't
be a bore at the sock hop.

12:49.725 --> 12:52.467
So, why don't you
clean yourself up

12:52.467 --> 12:55.209
and come by the Pembrooke
at 6:00-ish tonight?

12:55.209 --> 12:59.213
I'll be wanting to discuss
politics, art, current events.

12:59.213 --> 13:00.954
Dazzle me with your wit.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.217
Okay?

13:03.217 --> 13:04.740
Dazzle you. Okay.

13:06.089 --> 13:07.438
Well, I should motor.

13:07.438 --> 13:08.352
See you tonight.

13:09.832 --> 13:11.268
Archiekins?

13:14.924 --> 13:16.012
I'm rooting for you, stud.

13:27.110 --> 13:30.157
So they just do whatever
you say, is that it?

13:30.157 --> 13:31.114
Hmm?

13:33.421 --> 13:35.553
Oh, you mean boys?

13:37.251 --> 13:39.514
Boys aren't
too, too complicated.

13:42.604 --> 13:44.606
I wish I had your confidence.

13:44.606 --> 13:45.999
Why don't you?

13:46.956 --> 13:48.828
What do you mean?

13:48.828 --> 13:51.874
I mean, I'm only just getting
my sea legs here in Riverdale,

13:51.874 --> 13:55.791
but I can already tell
you're a catch, Betty.

13:55.791 --> 13:57.793
A total Marilyn.

13:57.793 --> 14:00.665
You and Kevin the Crooner
are going steady, aren't you?

14:02.102 --> 14:04.321
Um, not officially.

14:04.321 --> 14:06.062
We may even be on the rocks.

14:06.846 --> 14:07.759
That's a shame...

14:08.586 --> 14:10.458
for him.

14:10.458 --> 14:13.374
Why don't you invite
some other boy to the sock hop?

14:13.374 --> 14:15.506
Get Kevin all hot and bothered.

14:15.506 --> 14:18.553
That's always fun, keeping
our beaus on their toes.

14:18.553 --> 14:20.729
Surely there's some He-Man
at Riverdale High

14:20.729 --> 14:21.730
you'd like to make time with.

14:25.081 --> 14:26.996
Tickets. Get your
tickets to the sock hop.

14:26.996 --> 14:28.519
Buy one, get one free.

14:29.477 --> 14:32.001
You... Dilton Doiley.

14:32.001 --> 14:34.264
- Why haven't you bought
a ticket to my sock hop yet?
- Uh...

14:34.264 --> 14:37.615
For that matter,
why are some people
trying to return their tickets?

14:37.615 --> 14:41.228
Um... It might be because
of the Serpents.

14:42.751 --> 14:43.839
What about the Serpents?

14:45.145 --> 14:47.016
What are they planning?

14:47.016 --> 14:49.758
They said they were going to be
waiting in the parking lot,

14:49.758 --> 14:51.716
and they're gonna throw
rotten eggs at anyone

14:51.716 --> 14:53.457
who tries going to the dance.

14:53.457 --> 14:55.372
Barbarians.

14:55.372 --> 14:58.201
And who, pray tell,
is the one
making these threats.

14:59.942 --> 15:02.684
Mostly that scary Toni girl.

15:02.684 --> 15:04.947
Of course. It would be her.

15:06.122 --> 15:10.213
Well, this means war.

15:13.260 --> 15:14.130
Dismissed.

15:20.223 --> 15:21.050
Mom?

15:25.011 --> 15:26.229
Can you help?

15:26.229 --> 15:28.840
Hang on.

15:28.840 --> 15:30.320
I might have something
that'll do the trick.

15:35.238 --> 15:37.545
Oh, that's more like it.

15:37.545 --> 15:39.112
I think I'll have to
let it out a little bit,

15:39.112 --> 15:42.028
but other than that,
it fits perfectly.

15:42.028 --> 15:44.944
It's a little old-fashioned,
isn't it?

15:44.944 --> 15:47.250
Well, it was your dad's,

15:47.250 --> 15:50.775
but he'd want you to wear it,
especially to your first dance.

15:50.775 --> 15:53.648
Well, actually,
I need it tonight, Mom.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.521
Yeah. Veronica asked me over.

15:57.521 --> 15:59.393
You're taking her to the dance?

15:59.393 --> 16:01.656
If I'm lucky.

16:01.656 --> 16:05.094
She wants to give me
a test run, you could say?

16:05.094 --> 16:07.444
I don't like the sound of that.

16:07.444 --> 16:08.619
A bit haughty, isn't it?

16:09.969 --> 16:11.057
It's not like that.

16:11.057 --> 16:12.884
Veronica is from Los Angeles

16:12.884 --> 16:15.235
and she's practically
a movie star.

16:15.235 --> 16:16.627
Standards
are different out there.

16:18.629 --> 16:22.590
Aw, geez, Mom.
I'm fine.

16:24.244 --> 16:26.333
It's just, seeing you
here in his suit,

16:26.333 --> 16:28.291
it just brings back
so many memories.

16:31.207 --> 16:32.861
You know, your father and I
went to the sock hop together.

16:32.861 --> 16:34.906
He was such a romantic

16:34.906 --> 16:36.734
and he wrote me
the sweetest poems.

16:36.734 --> 16:37.735
I still have them somewhere.

16:39.128 --> 16:40.434
Poems?

16:40.434 --> 16:42.392
He knew how
to make a girl swoon.

16:44.742 --> 16:45.874
This one, I think.

16:45.874 --> 16:46.831
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

16:51.140 --> 16:54.317
So, Veronica
invited me over to her
place tonight, and...

16:55.884 --> 16:57.146
I need to impress her.

16:57.146 --> 16:58.060
So don't laugh...

16:59.583 --> 17:00.541
but I wrote her a poem.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.371
I just need someone
to read it and just

17:04.371 --> 17:05.633
tell me if it's crazy
to give to her.

17:08.636 --> 17:10.725
Okay. Hand it over,
Walt Whitman.

17:23.085 --> 17:25.653
Well, is it terrible?

17:29.483 --> 17:30.397
No.

17:32.660 --> 17:33.791
It's actually really sweet.

17:37.926 --> 17:39.449
You have a poet's soul, Arch.

17:39.449 --> 17:40.407
Who knew?

18:02.951 --> 18:04.866
So this is where
the Serpents dwell.

18:06.128 --> 18:07.434
I always imagined
it'd be something

18:07.434 --> 18:09.479
more like a biker bar,
but this...

18:09.479 --> 18:11.307
- This is--
- The Dark Room is

18:11.307 --> 18:15.311
a coffeehouse for bikers,
beatniks and badasses.

18:15.311 --> 18:18.184
Which begs the question,
what are you
doing here, preppy?

18:18.184 --> 18:19.707
Better question.

18:19.707 --> 18:21.143
Why are you so hell-bent
on ruining my sock hop

18:21.143 --> 18:23.363
the same way
your slimy Serpent pal

18:23.363 --> 18:25.060
tried to ruin
my virtuous Vixen?

18:25.060 --> 18:28.890
Okay, Cheryl. You want people
at your dance, I dig it.

18:28.890 --> 18:30.413
So I'll pitch it again.

18:30.413 --> 18:32.807
Let my boy Fangs
blow the roof off the gym

18:32.807 --> 18:35.070
and we'll pack the place.

18:35.070 --> 18:38.508
For the bazillionth time,
I have already booked
Kevin and the Crooners.

18:38.508 --> 18:40.902
Yeah, the Crooners
are doneskis.

18:40.902 --> 18:42.556
Look, Fangs is about to play.

18:42.556 --> 18:45.211
So why don't you order
yourself a cappuccino,

18:45.211 --> 18:47.300
take a load off
and hear him play?

18:47.300 --> 18:48.736
Maybe you'll change your mind

18:48.736 --> 18:51.521
and you and I can
get better acquainted.

19:08.712 --> 19:12.412
- Archie, you made it.
- Am I late?

19:12.412 --> 19:14.240
Oh, not at all, lover boy.

19:14.240 --> 19:15.980
We were just discussing
President Eisenhower's decision

19:15.980 --> 19:17.634
to run for a second term.

19:17.634 --> 19:20.463
And let me warn you,
the others are very divided.

19:21.899 --> 19:23.945
- I'm sorry. Others?
- Come. Come on in.

19:23.945 --> 19:25.686
We're having aperitifs
in the parlor.

19:42.485 --> 19:45.096
Mom,
can I ask your advice
about something?

19:45.096 --> 19:48.230
Well, of course, honey.
What is it?

19:48.230 --> 19:51.102
I think I'm having
weird feelings about Archie.

19:54.018 --> 19:56.891
Oh. What sort of feelings?

19:56.891 --> 19:59.589
Like, stirrings?

20:01.896 --> 20:07.554
When we were dancing,
I felt a flutter in my stomach.

20:10.121 --> 20:14.169
Is it possible that
this fluttering is

20:14.169 --> 20:16.998
a reaction to feeling
underappreciated by Kevin?

20:18.956 --> 20:21.263
I hadn't thought
of it that way.

20:21.263 --> 20:23.178
Which is why it's a good thing
that you came to me.

20:31.404 --> 20:33.362
Holy hell, Ethel.

20:33.362 --> 20:34.929
There is no way
that Mr. Fieldstone

20:34.929 --> 20:37.192
doesn't hire you
after he sees these.

20:37.192 --> 20:38.889
- You really think so?
- Yeah.

20:38.889 --> 20:40.456
Even though I'm a girl?

20:40.456 --> 20:41.805
If he doesn't,
I'll eat my own crown.

20:43.851 --> 20:48.464
So, uh, Jughead,
the sock hop's tomorrow night.

20:48.464 --> 20:49.509
It is?

20:49.509 --> 20:51.337
What if we went together?

20:51.337 --> 20:52.773
Like, for kicks?

20:54.601 --> 20:56.385
Yeah, yeah, just for kicks.

20:57.778 --> 20:59.432
Might be fun.

20:59.432 --> 21:00.868
Could have a decent
spread, cookies and whatnot.

21:07.222 --> 21:08.876
Since when are boys
allowed in your room?

21:08.876 --> 21:10.704
We're just studying, Mom.

21:10.704 --> 21:12.053
Well, whatever you were doing,
you're lucky your father's

21:12.053 --> 21:13.576
working nights
at the factory this week.

21:14.621 --> 21:17.188
I was actually just leaving.

21:17.188 --> 21:18.146
I'll see you
at school tomorrow.

21:19.147 --> 21:20.061
Excuse me. Sorry.

21:33.988 --> 21:36.643
So then I said,
"Sorry, Mr. Sinatra,

21:36.643 --> 21:39.341
but I think Elvis
sang it better."

21:39.341 --> 21:40.690
Oh, no.

21:42.953 --> 21:44.520
Archie, are you all right?

21:44.520 --> 21:46.479
You've been quiet all night.

21:46.479 --> 21:48.263
Yeah, I'm good.

21:48.263 --> 21:51.310
I was just...
I was just taking it all in.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.573
- Soaking it up.
- Like the sponge that you are.

22:01.015 --> 22:02.233
I see you're
admiring the painting.

22:03.800 --> 22:05.324
- It's a--
- It's a Monet. Am I right?

22:07.021 --> 22:11.373
Indeed. You have
a connoisseur's eyes, Julian.

22:11.373 --> 22:12.896
I appreciate beautiful things.

22:14.985 --> 22:18.075
Every summer,
my family goes on
an art-buying tour in Europe.

22:18.075 --> 22:19.990
Archie, what do you
think of the painting?

22:23.777 --> 22:24.604
Um...

22:26.170 --> 22:28.521
It's beautiful and all, uh...

22:28.521 --> 22:34.570
I guess I just prefer
an artist like Norman Rockwell.

22:34.570 --> 22:36.964
Then again, I'm not
really an art tour
through Europe kind of guy.

22:36.964 --> 22:40.184
- So--
- That's obvious from what
you're wearing, chump.

22:40.184 --> 22:41.838
Where'd you get that suit?

22:41.838 --> 22:43.492
Some thrift store?

22:44.711 --> 22:46.843
It's my father's suit.

22:46.843 --> 22:48.715
And you better
shut your trap, Blossom.

22:48.715 --> 22:49.846
Wasn't he buried in his suit?

22:51.152 --> 22:52.762
Or did he have more than one?

22:52.762 --> 22:55.591
He was buried in his uniform.

22:55.591 --> 22:59.769
Well, I, for one, think
you look very striking, Archie.

22:59.769 --> 23:04.078
And I like a bit of variety
in my men's attire,
as well as in my men.

23:05.253 --> 23:07.516
So, who's up for charades?

23:09.953 --> 23:11.999
You know, Veronica,
it has been
a real swell night,

23:11.999 --> 23:15.698
but, uh... I think I'm just
gonna blow out of here.

23:15.698 --> 23:18.440
If I stay any longer,
I might be liable to spill
someone's blue blood

23:18.440 --> 23:20.355
all over your nice,
expensive things.

23:46.120 --> 23:47.774
Good morning, Mrs. Andrews.

23:47.774 --> 23:50.124
As you may know,
I'm Veronica Lodge.

23:50.124 --> 23:52.126
Is Archie home,
by any chance?

23:52.126 --> 23:54.041
He's at the grocery store.

23:54.041 --> 23:56.086
Shopping? This early?

23:56.086 --> 23:58.393
Archie told me everything
that happened last night.

23:59.916 --> 24:02.397
Well, that's
actually why I'm here.

24:02.397 --> 24:04.051
I feel terrible about it.

24:04.051 --> 24:06.183
I didn't mean for things
to happen the way they did.

24:06.183 --> 24:10.579
My Archie is not
some Hollywood playboy.

24:10.579 --> 24:14.714
He's a simple boy. So simple
that he's mad at Julian Blossom

24:14.714 --> 24:17.368
and himself for what happened
at your little soiree,

24:17.368 --> 24:20.720
when you and I both know
who the real villainess was.

24:20.720 --> 24:23.113
I mean,
what kind of person

24:23.113 --> 24:26.073
auditions boys
to go to a sock hop?

24:26.073 --> 24:28.641
Well, when your parents
are actors...

24:31.252 --> 24:33.776
Sorry. That's not an excuse.

24:33.776 --> 24:36.039
Listen, if you hurt my boy,

24:36.039 --> 24:38.128
you and I are going to have
some serious trouble,

24:38.128 --> 24:40.609
Little Miss Femme Fatale.

24:47.224 --> 24:48.791
<i>Thanks for stopping by, Kevin.</i>

24:51.141 --> 24:54.580
- High Point?
- Okay.

24:54.580 --> 24:57.278
So, Betty tells me
that the two of you

24:57.278 --> 25:00.063
have had some
troubles as of late.

25:00.063 --> 25:01.282
Would you agree?

25:01.282 --> 25:04.024
I feel awful, Mrs. Cooper.

25:04.024 --> 25:07.462
It's like... Betty wants
these things from me,

25:07.462 --> 25:10.204
but I'm not sure
if I can give them to her.

25:10.204 --> 25:12.380
It's perfectly normal
for girls Betty's age

25:12.380 --> 25:14.425
to have certain...

25:14.425 --> 25:17.994
...expectations of
what their boyfriends
are willing to do.

25:20.083 --> 25:21.345
May I make a suggestion?

25:24.218 --> 25:25.219
I'm going to give you this.

25:28.744 --> 25:32.400
You see, Betty
just wants to be pinned.

25:32.400 --> 25:35.577
She wants to feel appreciated.

25:35.577 --> 25:39.755
And then all of those...
feelings will settle.

25:39.755 --> 25:42.410
But won't a pin mean
she'll expect more from me?

25:42.410 --> 25:46.501
Oh, no. A pin
takes off the pressure.

25:46.501 --> 25:50.461
You see, it's a symbol
for what every girl craves.

25:50.461 --> 25:52.159
They just...
They just want a fella

25:52.159 --> 25:54.465
that's going to carry
their books home from school

25:54.465 --> 25:57.033
or take them to the movies
Saturday night

25:57.033 --> 25:59.035
or call them on the telephone
before supper.

25:59.732 --> 26:00.559
Is that all?

26:02.038 --> 26:04.998
A pin is a promise, Kevin.

26:04.998 --> 26:08.828
Don't tell anyone,
but this is the actual pin

26:08.828 --> 26:11.744
that Mr. Cooper gave me
back in high school.

26:11.744 --> 26:13.397
See, this pin

26:13.397 --> 26:19.708
somehow answered a desire
that we both were feeling,

26:19.708 --> 26:23.146
and then things were
fine and pure
from that point forward.

26:24.060 --> 26:25.235
You're a good boy, Kevin.

26:26.280 --> 26:28.978
And Betty is a good girl.

26:28.978 --> 26:34.680
And I believe that this pin
will take care of everything.

26:41.600 --> 26:44.907
Tickets. Get your tickets
for tonight's sock hop.

26:44.907 --> 26:46.430
- Hurry up!
- You, four eyes.

26:46.430 --> 26:47.954
Get your tickets to
the sock hop yet?

26:47.954 --> 26:50.304
Uh... no.

26:50.304 --> 26:51.784
Well, pony up, poindexter,

26:51.784 --> 26:54.351
because my pal
Fangs Fogarty is performing.

26:54.351 --> 26:57.050
And trust me,
you'll be kicking yourself
if you miss it.

26:57.050 --> 26:58.225
I'll take one.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.490
Five. I'll take five.

27:07.843 --> 27:11.107
By the way, did you, uh,
break the bad news
to Kevin yet?

27:11.107 --> 27:13.153
No. But I will.

27:13.153 --> 27:14.110
Can you dig it?

27:18.419 --> 27:21.030
Putting aside the fact
that you were drawing

27:21.030 --> 27:23.293
while Dr. Doiley
was lecturing,

27:23.293 --> 27:26.383
in and of itself
a flagrant violation

27:26.383 --> 27:27.820
of school etiquette.

27:27.820 --> 27:31.258
Dr. Werthers and I are also

27:31.258 --> 27:34.348
deeply concerned about
what you were drawing.

27:34.348 --> 27:37.830
Where did the vision
for this come from, Ethel?

27:37.830 --> 27:41.181
Your subconscious?
A nightmare? The movies?

27:42.269 --> 27:43.052
They're for a story.

27:44.271 --> 27:45.272
What kind of story?

27:46.012 --> 27:47.535
A comic book.

27:47.535 --> 27:49.058
That I'm on deadline to finish.

27:49.058 --> 27:51.060
That's why I was drawing
in Dr. Doiley's class.

27:51.060 --> 27:54.673
I'm... I'm trying to
get a job at Pep Comics.

27:55.978 --> 27:57.763
They're based here in town.

27:57.763 --> 28:01.027
I'm sorry, Ethel,
but your budding career

28:01.027 --> 28:03.246
as an illustrator of
lurid comic books

28:03.246 --> 28:06.597
doesn't remotely justify
this behavior.

28:06.597 --> 28:09.296
You have a week's detention,
starting today.

28:14.040 --> 28:14.954
Veronica.

28:15.911 --> 28:17.696
Archie. Hi.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.220
Look, about last night...

28:20.220 --> 28:22.178
I'm sorry I rushed
out of there like that.

28:23.353 --> 28:24.441
I, uh...

28:26.661 --> 28:31.840
I sincerely was going to
rip Julian Blossom's head off.

28:31.840 --> 28:34.887
Well,
he would have deserved it.

28:34.887 --> 28:38.412
And I'm mortified about
what he said to you.

28:38.412 --> 28:41.763
I truly had a good time
getting to know you better.

28:44.157 --> 28:47.726
Well, um, in that case,

28:49.553 --> 28:51.120
if you haven't made
your decision yet,

28:51.120 --> 28:53.122
I'm still keen on taking you
to the sock hop tonight.

28:56.169 --> 28:58.649
I would love that, Archie,

29:00.826 --> 29:03.306
but I've already
made my selection.

29:03.306 --> 29:05.874
And...
I'm not going with anyone.

29:08.181 --> 29:10.574
What? Why?

29:10.574 --> 29:13.752
With so many excellent options,
it's simply impossible
for an it girl to choose.

29:15.536 --> 29:16.929
Options like Julian Blossom?

29:19.670 --> 29:22.412
You know,
I don't get you, Veronica.

29:22.412 --> 29:24.850
I mean, what was last night's
dog-and-pony show
all about then?

29:26.590 --> 29:28.679
I mean, forget last night.
This entire week.

29:28.679 --> 29:31.465
Making us... Making me
jump through hoops like that?

29:33.772 --> 29:36.252
It was a game, Archie.

29:36.252 --> 29:38.777
The queen of the hive
gets all her worker bees abuzz

29:38.777 --> 29:44.304
and then flies away before...
Before anyone's
stung too badly.

29:51.877 --> 29:53.356
<i>So, have you
made your pick yet?</i>

29:55.010 --> 29:57.970
Here's a late-breaking scoop
for Hedda Hopper.

29:57.970 --> 30:01.800
Socialite Veronica Lodge
has decided to go stag
to the sock hop.

30:03.714 --> 30:05.891
Well, what happened?
What about Archie?

30:05.891 --> 30:09.938
I'm in the midst of
a rude awakening, Betty.

30:09.938 --> 30:13.246
Turns out I've been
careless and thoughtless

30:13.246 --> 30:16.989
with a lot of the boys
at Riverdale High.

30:16.989 --> 30:21.732
Archie most especially,
and most undeservingly.

30:21.732 --> 30:23.169
Did you not like his poem?

30:24.735 --> 30:25.649
What poem?

30:28.304 --> 30:31.830
Archie wrote you a poem.
Did he not give it to you?

30:31.830 --> 30:34.615
Not that I know of.

30:34.615 --> 30:36.443
Not that I deserve,
in any case.

30:36.443 --> 30:39.881
Wait a minute. So who's Archie
going to the sock hop with?

30:39.881 --> 30:42.362
No one, as far as I know.

30:42.362 --> 30:43.711
I'll tell you
one thing, though.

30:43.711 --> 30:45.669
Whoever does
end up going with Archie,

30:46.540 --> 30:47.846
she is one lucky girl.

31:30.497 --> 31:32.586
Hey, Betty,
can I talk to you
for a second?

31:34.066 --> 31:34.893
It's important.

31:38.505 --> 31:40.246
Sure, let's talk.

31:47.644 --> 31:50.256
Cheryl bumped me
and the Crooners.

31:50.256 --> 31:51.953
Fangs Fogarty's performing.

31:51.953 --> 31:53.607
Apparently, he's God's gift
or something.

31:53.607 --> 31:55.261
I heard. Kev, I'm sorry.

31:55.261 --> 31:59.352
No, uh... I'm sorry.

31:59.352 --> 32:01.615
Betty, I'm really...
I'm really sorry.

32:03.095 --> 32:04.618
I was a dope.

32:04.618 --> 32:07.969
And you are the most wonderful,

32:07.969 --> 32:11.625
most ginchiest girl
in the world,
and I took that for granted.

32:11.625 --> 32:13.279
That won't happen again. Um...

32:16.369 --> 32:18.240
Betty Cooper,
will you go steady with me?

32:22.592 --> 32:25.030
- Kevin...
- Things will be
different this time.

32:25.030 --> 32:26.640
I promise. I...

32:28.598 --> 32:31.210
I love you, Betty. I do.

32:31.210 --> 32:32.907
And you make
my heart feel full.

32:34.343 --> 32:35.823
So will you be my girl?

32:37.477 --> 32:39.392
Will you go
to the sock hop with me?

32:42.003 --> 32:44.136
Yeah, of course.

32:44.136 --> 32:46.007
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

32:47.966 --> 32:48.879
All right.

32:53.275 --> 32:54.059
Um...

32:55.886 --> 32:57.801
Uh...

32:57.801 --> 33:00.108
How do I...
- I'll... I'll do it.

33:00.108 --> 33:01.675
Okay.

33:01.675 --> 33:02.502
All right.

33:11.902 --> 33:14.688
Guess who didn't show up
for her assigned detention?

33:15.515 --> 33:17.778
The Muggs girl.

33:17.778 --> 33:20.824
I'm concerned, Felix.
I... I think we should speak
to Ethel's parents.

33:23.218 --> 33:25.090
<i>God knows
what's troubling that girl.</i>

33:27.135 --> 33:30.965
Now, you want me to believe
that a girl, this girl,

33:30.965 --> 33:32.836
generated these pages?

33:32.836 --> 33:36.492
Yes, and she's currently
skipping detention

33:36.492 --> 33:38.973
because of how badly she wants
to draw comic books for you,

33:40.018 --> 33:42.281
Mr. Fieldstone.

33:42.281 --> 33:47.286
Well, young lady,
let me congratulate you.

33:47.286 --> 33:50.985
These are the most putrid pages
I've seen in a long time.

33:50.985 --> 33:53.596
And that's the highest
compliment I can give
any artist.

33:53.596 --> 33:55.033
Freckles, you have
some real talent.

33:55.903 --> 33:57.035
What's your name?

33:57.035 --> 33:58.210
Ethel.

33:58.210 --> 34:00.342
Thank you, Mr. Fieldstone.

34:00.342 --> 34:03.519
Well, freckles,
you and boy wonder here
make a terrific team.

34:03.519 --> 34:06.392
So, what are you,
boyfriend-girlfriend?

34:06.392 --> 34:07.610
Uh, no.

34:07.610 --> 34:09.656
We are just creative partners.

34:09.656 --> 34:13.399
- But we are going
to the sock hop together.
- Ah.

34:17.055 --> 34:19.883
Smithers. I'm about
to put my face on.

34:19.883 --> 34:21.711
My apologies, Miss Veronica.

34:21.711 --> 34:23.974
But I was emptying the bins
and came across something

34:23.974 --> 34:26.151
that I believe belongs to you.

34:27.978 --> 34:29.415
What's this?

34:29.415 --> 34:32.070
It seems to be a poem, miss.

34:46.475 --> 34:48.086
Mom, Dad,
is everything all right?

34:48.086 --> 34:49.826
We got called
down to your school.

34:49.826 --> 34:51.959
They said you're acting
like some delinquent.

34:51.959 --> 34:53.482
Drawing dirty pictures.

34:53.482 --> 34:55.702
On top of
staying up at all hours,

34:55.702 --> 34:58.313
inviting boys into your bedroom

34:58.313 --> 35:00.010
and now missing detention?

35:00.010 --> 35:02.361
We did not raise
you this way, Ethel.

35:02.361 --> 35:04.580
Maybe if you didn't
drink so much, Mom.

35:04.580 --> 35:06.843
And maybe if you weren't so
miserable all of the time, Dad.

35:06.843 --> 35:08.236
The hell did
you just say to me?

35:08.236 --> 35:09.716
Never mind.

35:09.716 --> 35:11.109
Where
do you think you're going?

35:11.109 --> 35:13.720
I'm going to the sock hop
with Jughead.

35:13.720 --> 35:15.809

Yeah, hardly.

36:00.636 --> 36:02.638
Just plain old
Kevin Keller tonight.

36:02.638 --> 36:05.467
I was sorry to hear
that tonight's lineup
had been changed.

36:05.467 --> 36:08.122
Oh, easy come, easy go.

36:08.122 --> 36:11.038
Supposedly, Fangs is an
out-of-this-world singer.

36:11.038 --> 36:12.953
Yeah, and he sure is
easy on the eyes.

36:14.868 --> 36:16.217
But I can say
the same about you.

36:17.218 --> 36:19.046
Anyway, I was...

36:19.046 --> 36:21.831
I was really looking forward
to seeing you perform tonight.

36:21.831 --> 36:24.007
Maybe you can
give me a private concert
one of these days?

36:25.226 --> 36:27.097
Yeah.

36:27.097 --> 36:29.535
Um, look, Clay, uh,
Betty's waiting for her punch,

36:29.535 --> 36:32.886
- so if you'll excuse me?
- Of course. Have fun tonight.

36:43.679 --> 36:46.552
Good evening, Riverdale High.

36:46.552 --> 36:50.033
Who's ready to rock 'n' roll?

36:50.033 --> 36:51.992
Well, in that case,

36:51.992 --> 36:54.777
find somebody to hold on to...

36:54.777 --> 36:56.214
because we're about
to shake things up.

37:43.652 --> 37:46.481
I wouldn't go that far.

37:46.481 --> 37:48.483
Come on, let's see your moves.

37:48.483 --> 37:50.355
I'm fine supervising
from right here.

37:50.355 --> 37:52.748
- Thank you very much.
- One boogie woogie

37:52.748 --> 37:55.795
and I'll stop hassling you
if that's what you really want.

37:55.795 --> 37:59.233
Fine.

38:43.582 --> 38:46.062
I got the poem
you wrote for me.

38:46.062 --> 38:47.281
Or at least I think you did.

38:48.413 --> 38:50.763
"A stolen look across the hall.

38:50.763 --> 38:53.766
I hope she hears
my silent call.

38:53.766 --> 38:56.029
Dreams of walks
through moonlit nights

38:56.029 --> 39:00.120
with the girl more beautiful
than all the cosmic sights."

39:00.120 --> 39:02.165
It's beautiful, Archie.

39:02.165 --> 39:05.430
Um... It barely rhymes.

39:05.430 --> 39:07.214
How do you feel
about a do-over?

39:07.214 --> 39:09.738
Or, to put it in other words,

39:09.738 --> 39:12.567
Archie Andrews,
may I have this dance?

39:17.616 --> 39:18.660
I'm sorry, Veronica.

39:19.531 --> 39:20.662
Maybe next time.

39:20.662 --> 39:21.968
Will you excuse me?

39:21.968 --> 39:22.925
Of course.

39:30.890 --> 39:32.761
Veronica Lodge.

39:34.241 --> 39:35.373
Julian Blossom.

39:36.765 --> 39:38.463
Where have you been
keeping yourself?

39:38.463 --> 39:41.030
Oh, I've been around.
Waiting for my moment.

39:44.425 --> 39:45.731
You could do a lot worse,
you know.

39:50.518 --> 39:51.389
Why not?
