<i>Desperate times call
for desperate measures.</i>

00:18.343 --> 00:21.085
<i>In one of the longest
and fiercest battles of the war,</i>

00:21.205 --> 00:24.452
<i>Separatist forces are on the verge
of claiming the planet Malastare.</i>

00:25.013 --> 00:27.125
<i>If the Republic loses this planet,</i>

00:27.245 --> 00:32.028
<i>it will cost them vital fuel resources
necessary for maintaining their armies.</i>

00:32.148 --> 00:34.607
<i>In a final effort to turn
the tide of this battle,</i>

00:34.617 --> 00:39.700
<i>Supreme Chancellor Palpatine has authorised
the use of the Republic's newest weapon,</i>

00:39.820 --> 00:42.234
<i>the electro-proton bomb.</i>

00:42.545 --> 00:46.171
<i>Now at the imperial palace of
Doge Urus, the leader of the Dugs,</i>

00:46.461 --> 00:51.501
<i>the Jedi count down the minutes until
the detonation of their doomsday device.</i>

01:01.826 --> 01:04.140
That's a lot of clankers.

01:13.818 --> 01:17.741
I won't allow my people
to become Separatist slaves!

01:17.861 --> 01:20.363
<i>I assure you, Doge Urus,
that will not happen.</i>

01:20.716 --> 01:25.736
<i>Dr. Boll has stated that only droids will
be affected by the bomb's electron field.</i>

01:25.856 --> 01:29.639
Yes, the clones and your people
will be quite safe.

01:30.020 --> 01:32.663
We have accounted
for every probable outcome.

01:32.680 --> 01:35.896
It's the improbable
that concerns me, Doctor.

01:36.189 --> 01:37.944
There must be other options.

01:37.969 --> 01:39.257
<i>I'm afraid not.</i>

01:39.716 --> 01:43.254
<i>This bomb is our only hope
of victory now.</i>

01:43.483 --> 01:45.268
The droids are on the move.

01:48.906 --> 01:50.506
<i>Go. Go.</i>

01:54.637 --> 01:57.222
We just need to hold them back
until the bomb drops.

02:04.699 --> 02:05.884
Blast them!

02:17.959 --> 02:19.672
Hold the line!

02:20.667 --> 02:22.523
We've got spiders inbound!

02:32.404 --> 02:34.144
Tell the bombers to take off.

03:18.074 --> 03:19.567
Approaching drop zone.

03:24.362 --> 03:25.808
Everyone stay tight.

03:26.239 --> 03:28.490
Remember, you've only got one shot at this.

03:28.510 --> 03:29.826
Bombs away.

04:11.078 --> 04:13.062
Here it comes!

04:14.847 --> 04:16.161
<i>I'm losing my transm...</i>

04:28.377 --> 04:31.515
Well, Doc, looks like it worked.

04:34.722 --> 04:36.392
The ground is sinking!

04:41.148 --> 04:42.349
Run for it!

05:23.363 --> 05:26.021
The droid army was completely
neutralised by the bomb.

05:26.036 --> 05:29.462
But the blast created a sinkhole
which engulfed many of our troops.

05:29.478 --> 05:31.625
We have search parties
looking for them now.

05:31.640 --> 05:32.943
<i>And the Dugs?</i>

05:32.957 --> 05:34.777
<i>Have they signed the treaty?</i>

05:34.785 --> 05:39.064
No, Chancellor. The treaty
must be passed by the Council.

05:39.162 --> 05:44.139
We need that treaty signed so we can gain
access to the fuel reserves here in Malastare.

05:44.555 --> 05:47.334
<i>Without it our armies
shall be vulnerable.</i>

05:47.469 --> 05:50.392
I will do my best.

05:51.816 --> 05:56.100
Sir, we have a report from the front.
They've lost contact with the rescue team.

05:57.008 --> 06:00.097
One problem always seems
to replace another.

06:04.539 --> 06:10.518
I hope your bomb has not upset
the delicate balance of our planet.

06:20.302 --> 06:24.133
You deal with the treaty and Doge Urus,
I'll help the rescue team in the crater.

06:45.075 --> 06:46.119
Split up.

06:46.838 --> 06:49.454
If you see anything contact me.

07:15.337 --> 07:17.159
General Windu, we've found them!

07:19.276 --> 07:22.668
- We've got what we want.
- We're on a tight timeline here.

07:23.006 --> 07:25.488
How long do you think it'll
take to get the treaty ratified?

07:25.824 --> 07:30.197
We are waiting for two more
members of the Council to arrive.

07:30.486 --> 07:32.979
They will sign the treaty.

07:32.989 --> 07:34.917
We appreciate your cooperation.

07:34.943 --> 07:38.070
Without your fuel,
our offensive will grind to a halt.

07:38.079 --> 07:42.963
This is the beginning of a great alliance.

07:47.582 --> 07:49.328
What happened down here, trooper?

07:49.350 --> 07:52.490
General, there's something down here with us.

07:53.136 --> 07:56.336
- And it's not Seppies.
- Calm yourself, soldier.

07:56.672 --> 07:57.765
We'll check it out.

07:58.567 --> 08:01.752
Trapper, Parns, Hawkeye, come with me.

08:05.016 --> 08:08.909
Skywalker, something strange is going on.

08:08.923 --> 08:10.823
I think you should come down here.

08:10.839 --> 08:13.808
I'm on my way.
Artoo, start up my fighter.

08:14.339 --> 08:15.565
If you'll excuse me.

08:20.743 --> 08:23.297
Sir, there's nothing around here
but rocks and debris.

08:23.417 --> 08:26.166
I have a bad feeling about this.

09:07.260 --> 09:09.614
- Skywalker?
- I'm here, what the--

09:09.643 --> 09:10.602
<i>We need your help!</i>

09:20.638 --> 09:23.023
Artoo, I can't see.
Turn on your beacon.

09:24.070 --> 09:25.147
Never mind.

09:32.229 --> 09:33.829
What the heck is that thing?

09:34.798 --> 09:36.552
Now's our chance, let's go!

09:49.197 --> 09:51.227
I've never seen anything like it.

10:19.186 --> 10:20.894
Artoo, get out of here.

10:31.916 --> 10:32.916
What?!

10:51.507 --> 10:53.922
We're going to need some heavy artillery.

11:02.670 --> 11:05.979
Don't worry about me. I'm all right.

11:06.066 --> 11:08.185
Where's your star fighter?

11:08.478 --> 11:12.978
- That thing ate it.
- That "thing", it is a Zillo beast.

11:13.094 --> 11:18.000
They once roamed Malastare,
devouring our ancestors.

11:18.120 --> 11:22.534
When the Dugs first started
harvesting the fuel in the planet's core,

11:22.556 --> 11:26.973
they were killed off.
They are supposed to be extinct.

11:26.998 --> 11:29.834
Apparently they're not.

11:52.829 --> 11:54.298
His weakness...

11:56.740 --> 11:57.936
What's going on out there?

11:57.962 --> 12:01.955
It is an internal matter.
None of your concern.

12:02.075 --> 12:04.746
Your men are killing a unique life form.

12:04.866 --> 12:08.238
It is a dangerous, bloodthirsty, monster!

12:08.358 --> 12:11.646
Did you forget that it tried to kill you?!

12:11.661 --> 12:13.311
It was under attack.

12:13.331 --> 12:16.232
It had lived peacefully below
the surface all these years.

12:16.267 --> 12:19.599
Until you unleashed it with your bomb.

12:19.619 --> 12:23.081
We dropped that bomb to save
your planet. At your request.

12:23.106 --> 12:26.519
To save our fuel for you to buy.

12:26.765 --> 12:32.654
If you want us to sign your treaty,
then you must help us destroy the beast.

12:32.904 --> 12:37.155
What purpose would it serve to kill it,
if it really is the last of its kind?

12:37.164 --> 12:38.960
It is our duty!

12:39.220 --> 12:43.355
Our ancestors warned us that one
would return someday...

12:43.365 --> 12:47.111
and destroy our entire civilisation.

12:47.132 --> 12:49.971
Will you help us or not?

12:50.569 --> 12:53.856
I respect your traditions
and your ancestors,

12:54.048 --> 12:58.598
but we can not allow the destruction
of an innocent life form.

12:59.150 --> 13:02.492
Then there will be no treaty.

13:05.384 --> 13:08.340
Master Windu, are you certain
this argument is worth it?

13:08.670 --> 13:12.420
After all, it's just one creature.
Remember what the Chancellor said.

13:12.446 --> 13:15.436
It isn't the creature, it's the principle.

13:15.462 --> 13:19.527
Allowing the Dugs to kill it
violates what we stand for as Jedi.

13:19.592 --> 13:22.013
But if we choose to defend the creature,

13:22.029 --> 13:24.700
we lose all hope of securing
a treaty with the Dugs.

13:29.190 --> 13:34.669
We'll handle this our way.
No matter what these Jedi think.

13:39.080 --> 13:43.780
<i>How remarkable. I have never
seen anything quite like it.</i>

13:44.159 --> 13:47.395
I recommend that we transport it off
the planet as soon as possible.

13:47.665 --> 13:51.070
We can find a place for it to
live undisturbed in the Outer Rim.

13:51.668 --> 13:54.305
<i>And what do the Dugs have
to say of this matter?</i>

13:54.326 --> 13:56.969
They want us to help them destroy it.

13:56.988 --> 14:01.120
<i>Then by all means help them.
This creature is of no importance to us.</i>

14:01.890 --> 14:05.535
<i>We can not be alienating
the Dugs at this crucial time.</i>

14:05.570 --> 14:08.745
It is not the Jedi way
to take an innocent life.

14:09.024 --> 14:11.380
Especially if it is the last of its kind.

14:11.730 --> 14:16.774
Chancellor Palpatine, I think it would be
in our best interest to study this creature.

14:16.790 --> 14:21.367
It's outer scales are virtually impenetrable.
None of our weapons could harm it.

14:21.560 --> 14:23.362
Even my lightsaber couldn't cut it.

14:23.373 --> 14:26.680
If we could somehow duplicate
that for our ships...

14:26.786 --> 14:29.048
<i>An impenetrable armour.</i>

14:29.355 --> 14:32.037
What if we let the Dugs think we killed it?

14:32.046 --> 14:34.250
Then we could have
the treaty and the creature.

14:34.350 --> 14:36.218
<i>Yes, Anakin, go on.</i>

14:36.245 --> 14:37.693
When I was climbing on the creature,

14:37.710 --> 14:40.528
I noticed small gaps between
the armour and its scales.

14:40.562 --> 14:44.052
Maybe a stun cannon or a pulse could
penetrate through the skin...

14:44.120 --> 14:48.030
and short circuit its nervous system,
like putting it into a deep sleep.

14:48.360 --> 14:50.860
He's right.
It would appear to be dead.

14:51.113 --> 14:55.055
We could transport it to a secure
location before it wakes up.

14:55.071 --> 14:57.028
The Dugs would never know the difference.

14:57.043 --> 15:00.879
<i>That may be the only way
we shall get this treaty signed.</i>

15:01.051 --> 15:04.724
<i>And rest Master Windu's conscience.</i>

15:18.030 --> 15:22.790
I'm glad you finally decided
to see things our way, Jedi.

15:23.170 --> 15:28.700
But you're a fool if you think your
weapons will even scratch Zillo beast.

15:28.950 --> 15:31.102
These are no ordinary weapons.

15:31.118 --> 15:33.519
Your Zillo beast will be no match for them.

15:33.950 --> 15:38.470
Maybe true, but our way
is already proven.

15:38.730 --> 15:42.930
- Your way?
- Open the valve!

16:15.470 --> 16:18.270
Our fuel is deadly to the beast.

16:18.380 --> 16:22.370
It killed them in the past,
it will kill this one now.

16:22.380 --> 16:24.070
You're only going to provoke it.

16:24.080 --> 16:26.670
You'll drive it out and
it'll be harder to deal with.

16:26.980 --> 16:29.490
We'll handle it, Jedi.

16:48.700 --> 16:50.500
Order them to stop.

16:50.510 --> 16:53.510
What? What do you mean, stop?

16:58.570 --> 17:02.448
- I said order them to stop.
- Or what?

17:02.477 --> 17:06.710
We are innocent life forms too, are we not?

17:30.100 --> 17:31.988
Charge up the rays.

17:55.330 --> 17:56.503
Fire.

18:06.460 --> 18:08.300
Back up! Back up!

18:17.040 --> 18:18.800
This isn't working.

18:47.780 --> 18:50.580
Whose bright idea was this anyway?!

18:56.060 --> 18:57.930
Keep the beam on him, he's getting tired.

19:20.780 --> 19:22.710
Hey, it worked!

19:23.020 --> 19:25.420
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

19:26.220 --> 19:27.600
You go first.

19:34.500 --> 19:37.980
Now, we just have to get him out of here.

19:50.560 --> 19:53.200
<i>Welcome to the Republic, Doge Urus.</i>

19:53.530 --> 19:57.050
<i>I'm sure this business arrangement
will be mutually beneficial.</i>

19:59.060 --> 20:01.540
The beast has been loaded
onto the transport.

20:01.719 --> 20:04.073
Have you selected a planet for relocation?

20:04.093 --> 20:06.923
<i>There has been a slight change of plans.</i>

20:07.181 --> 20:12.310
<i>The scientific community has reviewed
the data on this rather... unique creature.</i>

20:12.500 --> 20:14.588
<i>They believe it should be
further studied...</i>

20:14.593 --> 20:19.340
<i>in a more controlled environment
before it is released into the wild.</i>

20:19.380 --> 20:22.510
And where is this controlled environment?

20:22.640 --> 20:24.294
<i>On Coruscant.</i>

20:24.793 --> 20:30.120
<i>Master Windu, you and General Skywalker
shall safely bring the beast here.</i>

20:35.400 --> 20:37.102
Well, you made the right choice.

20:37.378 --> 20:40.786
We get our fuel, you saved
your creature, and now he'll be safe.

20:41.494 --> 20:45.325
Let's hope we can say
the same about Coruscant.
