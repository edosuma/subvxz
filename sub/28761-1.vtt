<i>Only one month after announcing</i>
<i>his candidacy for election,</i>

00:16.433 --> 00:20.186
<i>President Tom Kirkman needed a home run</i>
<i>at his State of the Union.</i>

00:20.270 --> 00:21.563
<i>Instead, he struck out</i>

00:21.646 --> 00:24.149

[reporter on TV]<i> Last night's</i>

00:25.483 --> 00:27.277

00:41.082 --> 00:43.752
Seth, we need to change the narrative.

00:43.835 --> 00:47.172
[stammering] Uh, yeah!
I have some ideas to run by Mark.

00:47.255 --> 00:49.591
-Don't bother.
-But he's my boss.

00:49.674 --> 00:52.969
The communications director is no longer
in the employ of the US government.

00:53.052 --> 00:54.304
Oh, my God, you fired him.

00:54.387 --> 00:56.306
Chiefs of Staff sometimes
have to do that, Seth.

00:56.389 --> 00:58.141
Yeah, of course, I wasn't implying that...

00:58.224 --> 01:00.310
The news media needs a new story.

01:00.393 --> 01:02.437
Steer them on
to the infrastructure vote coming up.

01:02.520 --> 01:05.565
I don't think that's gonna be enough
to distract the press from last night.

01:05.648 --> 01:07.525
-[speaking indistinctly]
-They're like a dog with a bone.

01:07.609 --> 01:10.278
You know how to get a bone away
from a dog, don't you?

01:10.361 --> 01:12.197
I really hope you're not gonna say,
"Shoot the dog."

01:12.280 --> 01:13.531
We're in the barrel here.

01:13.615 --> 01:15.867
Yeah, that's another phrase
that's always confused me.

01:15.950 --> 01:17.327
People say it all the time around here--

01:17.410 --> 01:19.621
In the barrel of a gun pointed at you.

01:19.704 --> 01:20.914
Yeah, I don't think that's it.

01:20.997 --> 01:22.874
Seth, change the narrative.

01:22.957 --> 01:25.335
Or you and Mark can meet up
at the public library

01:25.418 --> 01:27.295
for their resume-writing workshop.

01:27.378 --> 01:28.880

Hi. I need five minutes
with the president.

01:43.686 --> 01:45.188
Not happening today.

01:45.271 --> 01:46.523
When I was hired, I was told

01:46.606 --> 01:48.858
he wanted to make the Office
of Social Innovation a priority.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.152
He does. We all do. Who wouldn't?

01:51.236 --> 01:54.239
I have a proposal to repurpose
some USAID funding

01:54.322 --> 01:57.659

01:57.742 --> 01:59.911
I wanna update you
before the principals' meeting.

-I'm talking with him.
-[Mars] Thank you, Isabel.

02:04.249 --> 02:05.667
She doesn't appear to like you very much.

02:05.750 --> 02:07.293
Appearances can be deceiving.

02:08.211 --> 02:10.380
What news
from the national security advisor?

02:10.463 --> 02:14.384
Puerto Rico. The hurricane has
near incapacitated the saline industry,

02:14.467 --> 02:17.554
specifically the production
of sodium chloride injection bags.

02:17.637 --> 02:20.807
-That's pretty specific.
-It could put us in a vulnerable position.

02:20.890 --> 02:23.601
-How so?
-Unexpected military conflict arises,

02:23.685 --> 02:24.686
we could be left short-handed.

02:24.769 --> 02:27.981
We need to find a way to shore up
the medical products manufacturing sector.

02:28.064 --> 02:29.440
-I'll look into it.
-All right.

02:29.524 --> 02:31.401
Oh, and speaking of medical products,

02:31.484 --> 02:33.820
we gotta get that drink
that we keep saying we're gonna get.

02:33.903 --> 02:36.573
-We got to. When's good?
-How's next January?

02:36.656 --> 02:37.991
Book it.

02:38.074 --> 02:40.910
The chair of the DNC's in
the Roosevelt Room. She'd like a word.

02:51.671 --> 02:53.923
Ah. Looking for office space?

02:54.007 --> 02:57.135
-I believe this room is spoken for.
-It's not too late, Mars.

02:57.218 --> 02:58.636
Too late for what, Meg?

02:58.720 --> 03:00.889
It's not too late for him
to drop out of the race.

03:00.972 --> 03:04.642
But we already filled out
the statement of candidacy with the FEC,

03:04.726 --> 03:07.186
and you know what a pain in the ass
those folks can be

03:07.270 --> 03:08.771
about giving anything back.

03:08.855 --> 03:12.358
He's gonna siphon votes away from us,
which will result in Moss winning,

03:12.442 --> 03:15.695
which will result in the end
of the progressive agenda as we know it.

03:15.778 --> 03:18.239
Know what?
If you're worried about vote-splitting,

03:18.323 --> 03:20.533
maybe you guys should be the ones
to drop out.

03:20.617 --> 03:23.077
The Democratic Party? We should drop out?

03:23.161 --> 03:25.580

04:04.035 --> 04:05.912
You'd think I was Khrushchev at the UN,

04:05.995 --> 04:07.455
when the real story should be the Senate

04:07.538 --> 04:10.083
putting political expedience
above doing anything virtuous.

04:10.166 --> 04:11.501
Hell, doing anything at all.

04:11.584 --> 04:13.419
Not to mention what nobody's mentioning,

04:13.503 --> 04:16.714
is that absolutely everything I said
last night was the truth!

04:16.798 --> 04:20.176
Maybe it's not what you said,
Mr. President, so much as how you said it.

04:20.260 --> 04:24.013
Oh, please. So I offended
their delicate sensibilities?

04:24.097 --> 04:25.765
These sons of bitches are gonna use this

04:25.848 --> 04:27.976

I know it.

04:28.059 --> 04:31.479
Last check, OLA says that we've got
the numbers to pass the bill.

04:31.562 --> 04:33.773
Was that last check before last night?

04:33.856 --> 04:35.358
We need to get the vice president here.

04:35.441 --> 04:37.485
She has the ear of the Democratic caucus.

04:37.568 --> 04:39.570
We need her to start whipping support
for the vote now.

04:39.654 --> 04:41.864
-Yes, sir.
-This doesn't make sense.

04:41.948 --> 04:44.951
It's good for their states,
their constituents, and they don't care?

04:45.535 --> 04:48.329
It's obvious they don't care
about a bridge collapse in North Carolina.

04:48.413 --> 04:50.415
The bodies are still being
pulled out of the rubble.

04:50.498 --> 04:51.833
All due respect, Mr. President,

04:51.916 --> 04:54.752
I've been in this town
a hell of a lot longer than you have,

04:54.836 --> 04:57.714
and if there's one constant
to which you can set your watch,

04:57.797 --> 04:59.799
it's that this, too, shall pass.

05:00.383 --> 05:01.301

05:02.260 --> 05:03.594
So you're a watch guy, too?

05:06.139 --> 05:09.100

Priority number one has got to be

05:13.896 --> 05:16.566
-Did you check the list?
-I did.

05:16.649 --> 05:19.652
But I wanna talk to someone
who's not on it. Lorraine Zimmer.

05:20.236 --> 05:21.571
She deputied Moss's run.

05:21.654 --> 05:24.198
So she'd know the playbook on him.
Could be invaluable.

05:24.282 --> 05:27.660
I also hear she's party agnostic.
I would like you to set up the meet.

05:28.911 --> 05:29.912
Will do, sir.

05:30.830 --> 05:35.752
Now, you need to lobby some senators,
so maybe put on a suit.

06:18.377 --> 06:21.089
It's humid and infuriating. How's DC?

06:21.172 --> 06:22.757
Cold and infuriating.

06:22.840 --> 06:25.009
I bet it is, especially after last night.

06:25.093 --> 06:26.302
Oh, you watched?

06:26.385 --> 06:29.514
Yes, Seth, I watched the president
deliver the State of the Union.

06:29.597 --> 06:32.141
-What'd you think?
-You mean policy-wise, or...

06:32.225 --> 06:33.726
<i>Emily, what'd you think?</i>

06:34.435 --> 06:35.853
It was refreshing, actually.

06:35.937 --> 06:38.523
It was nice to hear some honesty
in and about the swamp.

06:38.606 --> 06:40.441
[chuckles] Maybe you could
convey that to the swamp,

06:40.525 --> 06:42.401

absolutely murdered up here.

06:43.194 --> 06:44.112
Why are you calling, Seth?

Look, obviously we're going through
a bit of a rough patch here. Um...

The president's been, you know,
different since you left.

11:00.076 --> 11:01.243
Where did you get this?

11:01.327 --> 11:04.497
From your friend Valeria.
After she tried to kill me.

11:04.580 --> 11:06.749
And you think that has something
to do with this?

11:06.832 --> 11:10.169
Unless provided
with a better explanation, yes.

11:11.671 --> 11:16.175
The president directed me to backchannel
information to the Russians.

11:16.258 --> 11:18.636
But beyond that,
I cannot divulge any details.

11:19.970 --> 11:23.265
Whatever happened between you and Valeria,
I wasn't a part of it.

11:26.560 --> 11:28.312
What are you gonna do? Torture me?

11:29.647 --> 11:32.441
I have to attend a disciplinary hearing.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.486
You think they'd be interested in this?

11:36.529 --> 11:38.489
You really think
the FBI doesn't already know?

11:38.572 --> 11:39.949
If I find out you're lying to me,

11:40.032 --> 11:42.284
it would be redundant to say
"I know where you live," right?

11:47.415 --> 11:48.791
[kissing]

11:50.459 --> 11:52.962
-[Isabel] I got you something.
-What for?

11:53.587 --> 11:56.340
You gotta have a reason?
Girl can't get you something?

12:02.388 --> 12:04.140
It's made by orphan girls in Kenya.

12:04.223 --> 12:05.141
[Aaron] Huh.

12:05.766 --> 12:08.144
-We underwrite the program.
-[chuckles]

12:08.227 --> 12:10.813
Consider it a belated
<i>Día de Los Reyes</i> gift.

12:10.896 --> 12:11.730
What's that?

12:13.190 --> 12:14.984
You're a terrible Latino.

12:15.067 --> 12:16.235
No, I love it.

12:16.318 --> 12:21.365
I just thought maybe it was a reward
for pressing Mars on Puerto Rico.

12:22.450 --> 12:23.909
Pressing him to do what?

12:25.035 --> 12:28.497
Leadership's attaching a rider
to the infrastructure bill.

12:29.498 --> 12:33.961
The Puerto Rico relief package.
Who's a terrible Latino now?

12:34.920 --> 12:37.965
-For who?
-What do you mean, "For who"?

12:38.549 --> 12:41.510
The relief.
Is it for mainland corporations,

12:41.594 --> 12:44.889
-or for Puerto Ricans themselves?
-I'm just trying to help.

12:44.972 --> 12:48.893
I'm sure you are.
And it doesn't hurt to prop up industry,

12:49.852 --> 12:52.229
but the people of Puerto Rico
need this help a whole lot more.

12:52.313 --> 12:54.857
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I know.
-[cell phone chimes]

12:56.859 --> 12:58.110
I gotta go.

13:02.573 --> 13:05.159
[Tom] Morning, Pen.
Checked it all last night.

13:05.242 --> 13:06.076
Thanks, Dad.

13:06.744 --> 13:08.287
[Tom] You know, I was thinking...

13:09.079 --> 13:11.957
I'd like you to call me Mr. President
like everybody else.

13:12.041 --> 13:15.211
-Ha, you're so funny.
-I'm sorry I've been so busy.

13:15.294 --> 13:17.254
I'd like us to have dinner tonight.

13:18.005 --> 13:21.800
-Oh, I can't. I have plans.
-Plans?

13:21.884 --> 13:24.303
Yeah. You're not the only one who's busy.

13:24.386 --> 13:26.222
I've got an event in Iowa tomorrow.

13:26.305 --> 13:28.474
The capital of Iowa is Des Moines.

13:29.058 --> 13:32.102
Oh, yeah?
What's the capital of South Dakota?

13:32.186 --> 13:33.312
You tell me.

13:34.355 --> 13:36.774
-Bismarck.
-That's North Dakota.

13:36.857 --> 13:38.817
I know. I just wanna make sure you did.

13:38.901 --> 13:40.653
Hey, come here. Sit down.

13:42.279 --> 13:44.573
I'm gonna have to do a lot more traveling
in the coming months

13:44.657 --> 13:45.824
'cause of the campaign.

13:45.908 --> 13:50.079
And I realized I never talked to you
about me running again.

13:50.871 --> 13:52.164
How do you feel about it?

13:54.250 --> 13:58.337
Well, I mean, it's kinda shitty,
but I'll be okay.

13:58.420 --> 14:01.924
Penelope Kirkman, your mother
would've washed your mouth out with soap.

14:02.007 --> 14:04.635
I saw the way you yelled
at those people in Congress.

14:04.718 --> 14:07.096
You can't get all weird
about my saying one curse word.

14:07.179 --> 14:10.474
Also, no one washes
anyone's mouth out with soap anymore.

14:10.558 --> 14:12.226
That's totally not a thing.

14:12.977 --> 14:16.063
Who are you and what have you done
with my daughter?

14:16.146 --> 14:18.065
I gotta go. I'm gonna be late for school.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.484
Good chat.

14:21.443 --> 14:24.196
-How's the whip count?
-Closer than we'd like.

14:24.280 --> 14:27.199
Is this Darby? Are people getting
cold feet because of her?

14:27.283 --> 14:29.660
It's possible.
We could go back to Haskell or Carlin,

14:29.743 --> 14:31.787
repack the suitcase
with their pet projects.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.247
There's too much pork in the bill
as it is.

14:33.330 --> 14:36.041
Emily, I didn't know
you were coming in today.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.418
Neither did I.

14:37.501 --> 14:42.006
-Didn't see her name on the schedule.
-Oh, it was a last minute addition.

14:42.882 --> 14:46.343
-Mars Harper. It's a pleasure.
-Emily Rhodes. Same.

14:47.344 --> 14:50.890
Oh. You've got the director
of Domestic Policy Council waiting, sir.

14:50.973 --> 14:52.683
Right. Come here.

14:53.559 --> 14:55.227
Hopefully, we can catch up later.

14:55.311 --> 14:56.604
-We will.
-[Tom] Okay.

15:00.357 --> 15:03.277
-You two seem to get along well.
-He terrifies me.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.280
I love what you've done with the place.

15:06.363 --> 15:08.282
I could put up some dream catchers

15:08.365 --> 15:10.951
or Ani DiFranco and Phish posters
from college.

15:11.035 --> 15:12.953
Or, I don't know, maybe a family photo

15:13.037 --> 15:14.830
like a normal human
with a human connection.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.081
Speaking of family,

15:16.165 --> 15:18.667
I did one of those "spit in the cup
and send away your DNA" things.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.878
-Really? Why?
-I don't know, health reasons.

15:20.961 --> 15:24.006
See if I have to worry about hereditary
thrombophilia, things like that.

15:25.591 --> 15:28.010
Also so I could learn
about my birth parents.

15:28.093 --> 15:30.054
-Mmm.
-How's your mom?

15:31.096 --> 15:34.183
She's hanging in.
Ovarian cancer's a bitch.

15:34.850 --> 15:37.269
Are you thinking of staying in Tampa
for a while?

15:38.562 --> 15:40.230
I don't know if I'm built for DC.

15:40.856 --> 15:42.024
I wish you'd come back.

15:42.858 --> 15:44.860
You know him better than anybody else.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.612
You've been together
since before he was president.

15:46.695 --> 15:49.406
And it's not like you'd need
to take your old job back.

15:49.490 --> 15:50.658
God forbid.

15:50.741 --> 15:52.534
[chuckles] Putting aside the fact

15:52.618 --> 15:54.578
that I almost shit my pants
every time he walks by,

15:54.662 --> 15:57.665
Harper's really good at what he does.
And he knows everybody.

15:57.748 --> 16:00.084
Obviously, that's why
Kirkman brought him in.

16:01.168 --> 16:03.712
But something's missing.
Someone's missing.

16:03.796 --> 16:08.008
I was Chief of Staff.
What do you do after that?

16:08.092 --> 16:10.636
They're creating new jobs around here
all the time.

16:10.719 --> 16:12.304
You could be whatever you want.
You know that.

16:12.388 --> 16:13.681
[knock on door]

16:13.764 --> 16:15.724
Seth, you were supposed to start
15 minutes ago.

16:16.600 --> 16:19.478
Just keep it in mind.
We could really use you around here.

16:23.357 --> 16:24.733
Lorraine Zimmer's here.

16:24.817 --> 16:27.778
Right. Bring me up to speed
on what she's been doing

16:27.861 --> 16:29.488
since she got Moss elected president.

16:29.571 --> 16:32.157
She started her own PR
and crisis management firm.

16:32.241 --> 16:33.867
Mainly corporate clients.

16:33.951 --> 16:38.455
They just helped a new app go public,
something called Enjoy My Wheels.

16:38.539 --> 16:42.668
They're disrupting the car rental biz
the way Uber killed the taxi.

16:43.252 --> 16:45.754
Apparently, folks can just rent out
their own cars.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.172
Stock's going through the roof.

16:47.256 --> 16:49.967
Don't forget I'm paying
for your divorce lawyer, Alan.

16:51.135 --> 16:54.304
I don't care if we have to sell the boat.
You're probably gonna sink it anyway.

16:54.388 --> 16:57.016
But, hey, must be nice to know
that if you needed to,

16:57.099 --> 17:01.353
you could use your new girlfriend's
fake tits as a flotation device.

17:01.437 --> 17:02.271
I'm in the White House.

17:02.354 --> 17:04.148
Don't make me tell you
to go fuck yourself.

17:04.815 --> 17:08.527
[clears throat] Lorraine Hanfield Zimmer.
It's an honor.

17:09.153 --> 17:10.279
Come on in.

17:12.448 --> 17:14.950
The history of American
presidential elections

17:15.034 --> 17:17.369
certainly has its conventional wisdoms.

17:17.453 --> 17:21.081
-An Independent candidate has never won.
-Not since George Washington.

17:21.165 --> 17:23.500
And there's never been
a third party incumbent,

17:23.584 --> 17:26.378
so I feel the same way
about conventional wisdom

17:26.462 --> 17:28.088
as I do about conventionality.

17:28.172 --> 17:30.007
-[blows raspberry]
-[Tom laughs]

17:31.300 --> 17:33.886
[Lorraine] There's no certainties.
There's only outcomes.

17:33.969 --> 17:35.220
But that being said,

17:35.304 --> 17:39.475
I do like to have as much information
as possible at my disposal.

17:39.558 --> 17:42.061
So I had my girl do some quick polling,

17:42.144 --> 17:46.148
and I've never seen anything like it.
You, Moss...

17:46.231 --> 17:51.236
'cause, yeah, it's gonna be Moss...
and a generic Democratic candidate.

17:51.320 --> 17:54.615
At this point,
it is a virtual three-way dead heat.

17:55.240 --> 18:00.746
I mean, even Ross Perot
only pulled 19% in '92. [whistles]

18:00.829 --> 18:04.625
This is gonna be a fascinating election.
I honestly cannot wait.

18:04.708 --> 18:07.961
Well, I've heard great things
about you, Lorraine,

18:08.045 --> 18:09.922
but you're even more impressive in person.

18:11.006 --> 18:13.592
We will be thrilled to welcome you aboard.

18:14.343 --> 18:17.471
Oh. Mr. President,
that's so very sweet of you,

18:17.554 --> 18:19.223
but I didn't say I was coming aboard.

18:19.973 --> 18:23.143
I'm sorry, I thought by you coming here
to the White House,

18:23.227 --> 18:26.188
-that meant you were interested.
-Yes, I wanted to meet you.

18:27.689 --> 18:28.774
Moss.

18:30.192 --> 18:33.403
I've heard rumors that Moss
is not happy with his current team.

18:33.487 --> 18:36.573
-The man's very rarely happy.
-[Tom] Are you joining his campaign?

18:36.657 --> 18:38.659
He has asked and I am considering it.

18:39.952 --> 18:43.038
Do you mind if I ask why you're not
interested in joining my campaign?

18:43.122 --> 18:46.959
You've never run for office.
You've never done retail politics.

18:47.042 --> 18:48.377
You've never campaigned.

18:49.336 --> 18:53.799
Mr. President, people like you
and they like that you're Independent.

18:54.383 --> 18:58.137
They sure liked your wife,
and they were sorry for you when she died.

18:58.720 --> 19:02.349
But aside from that,
I don't know who you are.

19:02.432 --> 19:05.686
And I can't sell a product
if I don't know the brand.

19:08.939 --> 19:11.150
I understand. Thank you for your time.

19:11.233 --> 19:13.110
[Lorraine] I wish you
the very best of luck.

19:18.407 --> 19:20.701
I'm gonna be having guests
in the Residence tonight.

19:20.784 --> 19:23.245
I'll get you the names shortly. Thank you.

19:25.914 --> 19:27.583
Names of the survivors?

19:27.666 --> 19:29.793
In the binder, under the bridge's tab.

19:30.836 --> 19:34.506
In the future, I'd appreciate a heads-up
when former staff come to the building.

19:34.590 --> 19:36.008
Especially when former staff

19:36.091 --> 19:39.136
happened to previously hold the job
that I currently possess.

19:39.219 --> 19:41.972
Yes, of course. Won't happen again.

19:43.390 --> 19:47.144
They're smelling blood,
so cut their fuckin' noses off.

19:49.771 --> 19:51.690
"Cut their fuckin' noses off"?

19:52.316 --> 19:56.195
As you know, pending the Senate vote,
the president's been working the phones.

19:56.278 --> 19:58.697
We've got members of the senior staff
up on the hill.

19:58.780 --> 20:02.326
This is a high priority, not just for
the president but for the whole country.

20:02.409 --> 20:04.912
With that, I'm happy to take questions.
We'll start with Claire.

20:04.995 --> 20:06.371
Does the president have a comment

20:06.455 --> 20:08.707
on Vice President Darby's decision
to leave the ticket?

20:08.790 --> 20:10.792
He wishes her well. Phil, then Brian.

20:10.876 --> 20:13.921
Is it true the DNC requested
the president drop out of the race?

20:14.004 --> 20:16.215
You'd have to ask Meg Chambers
that question.

20:16.298 --> 20:18.759
How does the president feel
about the negative coverage

20:18.842 --> 20:19.676
of the State of the Union?

20:19.760 --> 20:22.179
The president's not focused on coverage,
he's focused...

20:22.262 --> 20:24.932
Look, I know it's not
the White House's place

20:25.015 --> 20:28.810
to suggest lines of inquiry
to our partners in the press,

20:28.894 --> 20:32.314
but come on, guys, don't you ever
get tired of these tabloid obsessions?

20:32.397 --> 20:35.943
Why not clear your palate?
Ask about the school lunch initiative,

20:36.026 --> 20:38.362
or what we're doing on veterans' affairs.

20:38.445 --> 20:40.697
Why don't you ask
about the bridge collapse

20:40.781 --> 20:44.117
which highlights exactly why we need
this infrastructure bill?

20:44.201 --> 20:48.163
You could ask about Annabelle Martin,
13 years old, from Asheville.

20:48.247 --> 20:52.000
She lost both parents and a brother
in the tragedy in North Carolina.

20:53.502 --> 20:56.255
-Ask about things that are important.
-[camera shutters clicking]

20:56.338 --> 20:58.257
[reporter] So is the president
going to drop out?

20:58.340 --> 21:00.092
[reporters clamoring]

21:06.640 --> 21:08.976
Obviously, the infrastructure bill
is our main priority,

21:09.059 --> 21:10.602
-but we can't lose sight--
-[knock on door]

21:11.853 --> 21:16.483
Emily, I'm so glad you could make it.
The band is getting back together.

21:16.566 --> 21:17.818
[chuckles]

21:19.611 --> 21:23.031
-[Seth] Which monster invented this?
-[Emily] A genius monster of Cincinnati.

21:23.115 --> 21:25.284
[Seth] Seriously, who puts chili
over spaghetti?

21:25.367 --> 21:27.119
[Aaron] Hey, don't judge. I was in India,

21:27.202 --> 21:29.830
street vendors were hawking
steamed hornets on top of fried snails.

21:29.913 --> 21:33.500
Oh, come on, I am not responsible
for the cuisine of my people, okay?

21:33.583 --> 21:35.168
-I've never even been there.
-[Emily chuckles]

21:35.252 --> 21:37.671
But if you are gonna eat hornets,
I hear steamed is the way to go.

21:38.338 --> 21:41.466
Aaron, thank you for making us aware
of the Puerto Rico issue.

21:41.550 --> 21:43.593
It could easily have been overlooked.

21:45.053 --> 21:47.764
Actually, sir, we may be
overlooking something else.

21:48.849 --> 21:51.268
The industry on the island
needs help, sure,

21:51.351 --> 21:54.187
but we could be doing more
in the way of humanitarian aid

21:54.271 --> 21:57.357
for the local population.
A little goes a long way there.

21:57.441 --> 21:59.860
I'll talk to the sponsors,
add some language to the rider.

21:59.943 --> 22:00.944
Thank you, sir.

22:01.737 --> 22:02.946
Since when do you care about Puerto Rico?

22:03.905 --> 22:06.158
I care about all unincorporated
US territories.

22:06.241 --> 22:08.285
Right.
Isn't your new girlfriend Puerto Rican?

22:08.368 --> 22:10.954
-You keeping tabs on me now?
-[Tom] Enough, you two.

22:11.038 --> 22:13.081
As much as I enjoy this conviviality,

22:13.165 --> 22:16.668
I had an ulterior motive
to bring you all here tonight.

22:17.419 --> 22:21.423
Now, I know that I surprised all of you
with my announcement to run.

22:22.007 --> 22:24.634
And I'm sorry I didn't share
that decision with you.

22:25.385 --> 22:27.929
But each one of you has been with me
from the beginning of this ride,

22:28.013 --> 22:29.056
Emily, even longer.

22:30.891 --> 22:33.977
And since Alex died,
you've become the people I trust the most.

22:34.561 --> 22:38.607
So I need your opinion, your advice.
This election, can I win it?

22:39.274 --> 22:40.192
-It's a wide-open race.
-Yes.

22:40.275 --> 22:42.277
-[all muttering indistinctly]
-Okay, okay.

22:42.360 --> 22:45.572
As well-intentioned
as your bullshit responses are,

22:45.655 --> 22:48.408
come on, I need you to be honest.

22:48.492 --> 22:50.827
Tell me what you really think.
Tell me the truth.

22:55.207 --> 22:56.541
[Seth] It's not impossible.

22:57.292 --> 22:59.503
But, and this has nothing to do with you,

22:59.586 --> 23:03.131
I don't see a clear path forward
for any Independent candidate.

23:03.715 --> 23:06.968
There are too many structural obstacles
for you to circumvent,

23:07.052 --> 23:09.888
particularly without the support
of a party organization.

23:10.472 --> 23:12.557
This is one of the reasons
a lot of people are jumping ship.

23:12.641 --> 23:13.934
They're looking for their next jobs.

23:14.017 --> 23:15.727
[Aaron] As a member
of the Republican Party,

23:15.811 --> 23:18.271
Moss will score the conservatives
and the older demographic,

23:18.355 --> 23:19.815
and those people vote.

23:19.898 --> 23:22.150
The Democratic nominee
will take the progressives,

23:22.234 --> 23:25.570
and if it's Darby's, to be blunt,
she'll pick up African Americans,

23:25.654 --> 23:27.989
and, you gotta assume,
other racial minorities.

23:28.073 --> 23:29.783
It's a tough needle to thread.

23:29.866 --> 23:32.911
And think of it this way.
You could punch your ticket as the guy

23:32.994 --> 23:36.373
who put the country back on track
after an historic tragedy.

23:36.456 --> 23:41.503
Posterity will remember you well.
But if you run, and if you lose,

23:42.170 --> 23:44.256
if you come in third, that's your legacy.

23:45.048 --> 23:46.049
Yeah.

23:47.968 --> 23:50.595
-Emily, what do you think?
-I think you can do it.

23:51.221 --> 23:52.931
But you're asking the wrong thing.

23:53.723 --> 23:55.892
"Can I win?" makes the question about you,

23:55.976 --> 23:57.769
when the question should be
about the country.

23:57.853 --> 24:00.063
So, it's not "Can I win?"

24:00.689 --> 24:02.816
It's "Why am I running
in the first place?"

24:04.651 --> 24:05.735
So, why are you?

24:14.286 --> 24:15.495
Hey, excuse me.

24:16.079 --> 24:18.498
Holy shit. You're the press secretary.

24:18.582 --> 24:20.417
For now, yeah. You are?

24:20.500 --> 24:23.211
Dontae Evans.
I'm the director of online engagement.

24:23.295 --> 24:25.255
I mean, my boss
is director of online engagement,

24:25.338 --> 24:26.756
but she hasn't shown up
the last couple days.

24:26.840 --> 24:29.467
I need someone to come along
on the president's Iowa trip,

24:29.551 --> 24:31.261
handle online messaging. Can you do that?

24:31.928 --> 24:33.263
-Yeah.
-Great.

24:33.346 --> 24:36.641
-What, like, right now?
-Now would be great, yeah.

24:40.353 --> 24:43.064
-You're on Twitter, right?
-Bane of my existence.

24:43.148 --> 24:45.233
Maybe you saw this hashtag
I created a couple days ago.

24:45.317 --> 24:46.651
"The system is broken," it's called.

24:46.735 --> 24:49.279
-I can show you--
-Let's just keep it moving.

24:52.991 --> 24:55.744
Remind me again
why I'm taking this trip to Iowa now.

24:55.827 --> 24:58.038
Caucuses are big two-party platforms.

24:58.121 --> 25:00.832
It can't hurt to get there
and steal some of their oxygen.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.250
Consider it a campaign-launcher.

25:02.334 --> 25:05.003
You don't think it's more important
that I stay here and twist some arms?

25:05.086 --> 25:07.464
We have twisted everything
that is twistable.

25:07.547 --> 25:12.052
It's in God's hands now.
I will let you know when the vote is in.

25:12.135 --> 25:15.430
-In the meantime, stay part of the story.
-Got it.

25:19.184 --> 25:20.310
[man] Breaking and entering,

25:20.393 --> 25:25.857
infiltrating civilian computer systems,
hacking personal phones without a warrant.

25:25.941 --> 25:27.275
Do you have anything to add?

25:27.943 --> 25:29.319
Just that I don't see any cameras,

25:29.402 --> 25:32.739
so this seems like a lot of grandstanding
for an audience of one.

25:32.822 --> 25:35.951
I wouldn't take these proceedings
so irreverently, Agent Wells.

25:36.034 --> 25:37.077
Your career's in the balance.

25:37.160 --> 25:40.580
I did my job, Deputy Director.
I protected my president.

25:40.664 --> 25:43.083
Who's been cleared of any wrongdoing,
by the way,

25:43.166 --> 25:45.335
by both the attorney general
and Special Counsel West.

25:45.418 --> 25:47.587
It was the special counsel himself
who provided us

25:47.671 --> 25:50.090
with these many examples
of your transgressions.

25:51.216 --> 25:54.427
I'm not sure you appreciate
the gravity of the situation here.

25:54.511 --> 25:57.931
Unless you're of the mind that agents
of the United States government

25:58.014 --> 26:01.268
can kill people in allied countries
without consequences.

26:02.519 --> 26:04.688
Oh, do I have your attention now?

26:04.771 --> 26:07.524
After much conversation,
the British are opting not to prosecute

26:07.607 --> 26:09.776
for the sake of our special relationship.

26:09.859 --> 26:13.113
But they've made it clear
you're persona non grata in the UK.

26:13.196 --> 26:16.616
I've promised we'd settle accounts.
We'll have your badge, Hannah.

26:16.700 --> 26:20.495
Everything I have done, everything,
has been to protect this country.

26:20.578 --> 26:23.123
-You can't just throw--
-That's enough. We're done.

26:23.873 --> 26:26.459
You're lucky to have been dismissed
without charges.

26:33.675 --> 26:35.844
[Seth] The Senate voted
on the infrastructure bill.

26:35.927 --> 26:39.055
-What's the tally?
-Failed. 48-52.

26:39.139 --> 26:40.098
[sighs] Son of a bitch.

26:40.181 --> 26:43.351
Also, sir, we got word
that there may be a glitch at this event.

26:43.435 --> 26:45.895
-[Cornelius] Mr. President!
-[Seth] Ugh, Moss.

26:45.979 --> 26:48.940
Oh, great. I'll see you at the car.

26:49.024 --> 26:51.192
So it was your plane
that was holding us up.

26:51.276 --> 26:52.235
I should have known it.

26:53.153 --> 26:56.031
-You know Lorraine Zimmer, of course.
-Yes.

26:56.114 --> 26:58.450
Lorraine has decided to rejoin my team.

26:58.533 --> 27:00.702
-If I can fit you into my schedule.
-[Cornelius chuckles]

27:00.785 --> 27:02.370
Congratulations to both of you.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.372
Ah, campaigning, am I right?

27:05.415 --> 27:08.376
Then again, I don't suppose
you'd really know about that, would you?

27:09.210 --> 27:11.838
Good luck at your event, Mr. President.
Lorraine?

27:25.602 --> 27:26.644
[sighs]

27:27.896 --> 27:30.106
Seth, why am I staring at an empty room?

27:30.190 --> 27:33.068
[Seth] I think this is the glitch
that I mentioned, sir.

27:33.151 --> 27:34.444
Let me find out more.

27:37.405 --> 27:40.241
-Hey, what's going on?
-[man] We're shrinking the room.

27:40.325 --> 27:41.993
Yeah, I can see that. Why?

27:42.077 --> 27:46.247
-Because there's almost no one here.
-Okay, and why is that?

27:50.085 --> 27:53.296
So, apparently,
and this is unsubstantiated,

27:53.380 --> 27:56.549
but Moss's campaign robocalled
all of our confirmed attendees

27:56.633 --> 28:00.303
telling them the event had been canceled.
Hence, the meager turnout.

28:00.387 --> 28:02.222
We have a field team out
to try to fill seats.

28:02.305 --> 28:04.641
-Still want to go through with this?
-Absolutely not.

28:06.810 --> 28:09.562
-Buy their lunches. Fix this.
-[Seth] Sir.

28:22.409 --> 28:25.578
Hey, buddy.
I'm just as disappointed as you.

28:25.662 --> 28:27.288
What happened?
I thought we had the votes, man.

28:27.372 --> 28:28.873
I thought so, too.

28:28.957 --> 28:32.627
But legislation does get unpredictable
in election years.

28:32.710 --> 28:36.381
Best I can tell, Darby took
a couple of Democrats with her.

28:36.464 --> 28:38.716
-Shit.
-On a positive note,

28:38.800 --> 28:41.970
I did find a workaround
for your saline situation.

28:43.138 --> 28:46.599
FDA is gonna let us import
medical product from Ireland.

28:46.683 --> 28:48.351
How is that supposed to help
Puerto Ricans?

28:48.435 --> 28:50.770
It doesn't, but it helps us.
So, you're welcome.

28:50.854 --> 28:52.897
-Mars, the whole point of this was--
-Listen.

28:52.981 --> 28:54.816
Don't go behind my back to the president.

28:56.025 --> 28:57.610
I didn't go behind your back.

28:57.694 --> 29:00.447
Asking for humanitarian aid
is not your bailiwick.

29:01.114 --> 29:02.907
We have a history, yeah.

29:02.991 --> 29:05.201
But that doesn't mean
that you get to cut the line.

29:06.077 --> 29:07.746
Everything goes through me.

29:12.375 --> 29:15.837
Yeah. I know it's short notice,
but it's "rabbit out of the hat" time.

29:15.920 --> 29:18.631
I need you to look
at the entire caucus event calendar,

29:18.715 --> 29:20.675
see if there's something
we can piggyback on.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.385
You better not be playing <i>Fortnite,</i> dude.

29:22.469 --> 29:24.637
Not all millennials
play video games, dude.

29:24.721 --> 29:27.474
Do you remember the hashtag
I told you about before we left?

29:27.557 --> 29:30.477
I hope it doesn't hurt your feelings
to I say that I do not.

29:30.560 --> 29:33.688
Okay, after the State of the Union,
I put this hashtag out,

29:33.772 --> 29:36.441
"The system is broken."
You know what trending is?

29:36.524 --> 29:37.984
I know what trending is.

29:40.653 --> 29:42.197
It's generating a ton of traffic.

29:42.822 --> 29:45.325
People are really responding
to what the president said.

29:45.408 --> 29:47.994
They're posting videos,
venting about broke shit, broke politics--

29:48.077 --> 29:50.580
These videos, they're all coming
from one specific event.

29:50.663 --> 29:52.332
Yeah. It's an abandoned mall.

29:52.415 --> 29:56.085
It's a protest. I guess they planned it
to counterprogram the caucuses.

29:56.169 --> 29:57.962
Hey, where are you going
with my tablet, man?

29:58.046 --> 29:59.339
[Seth] I gotta talk to the president.

30:21.236 --> 30:22.403
Ms. Wells.

30:24.531 --> 30:25.365
Do I know you?

30:25.448 --> 30:28.701
You do not. But I know you.

30:29.786 --> 30:33.206
I'm assuming the hearing resulted
in termination.

30:35.917 --> 30:37.252
Well, I'm leaving now.

30:38.670 --> 30:40.797
I can tell you about that video.

30:43.258 --> 30:46.719
-How do you know about the video?
-Because we shot it.

30:48.680 --> 30:51.432
How'd you like to come work for the CIA?

30:55.311 --> 30:56.646
[people shouting indistinctly]

30:56.729 --> 31:00.859
It's not a clean site, but we made
a buffer between POTUS and the RPs.

31:01.568 --> 31:03.736
-"RPs"?
-Real people.

31:03.820 --> 31:07.282
I'm not sure about this.
What am I supposed to do, the speech?

31:07.365 --> 31:10.702
Well, just feel it out
when you get up there. Wing it.

31:11.744 --> 31:16.416
"Wing it"? That's an interesting
communications strategy, Seth.

31:19.502 --> 31:22.380
Listen up, people.
You are not gonna believe this.

31:22.463 --> 31:26.676
We have a special visitor
all the way from Washington, DC.

31:26.759 --> 31:30.221
-[crowd groaning]
-[woman 1] No, hear me out. Hear me out.

31:30.305 --> 31:31.514
-This isn't one of them.
-[sighs]

31:31.598 --> 31:33.975
-Excuse me, I'm gonna wing it.
-This is one of ours.

31:34.058 --> 31:36.019
-[man 1] Give me a break.
-A true Independent.

31:36.644 --> 31:40.607
The president of the United States,
Tom Kirkman.

31:43.985 --> 31:47.780
-Thank you. Thank you.
-[man 2] Welcome.

31:47.864 --> 31:50.033
Thank you for letting me crash your party.

31:50.116 --> 31:53.286
-[man 3] What's he doing here?
-I came here to Iowa to deliver a speech.

31:54.454 --> 31:58.833
And now that I'm standing here among you,
it doesn't feel as relevant.

31:59.417 --> 32:04.213
Now, I don't know if you've heard,
but I had my ass handed to me today.

32:04.297 --> 32:05.298
By the Senate.

32:05.381 --> 32:09.719
You see, we had a bill.
A really, really good bill.

32:09.802 --> 32:12.305
A bill that was designed
to help people like you,

32:12.388 --> 32:14.182
in places like this.

32:14.265 --> 32:18.436
To transform forgotten communities
and turn them into revitalized ones.

32:18.519 --> 32:22.065
Communities of hope and industriousness.

32:22.148 --> 32:24.317
It was designed to help the people
in North Carolina,

32:24.400 --> 32:26.444
who right now are suffering a loss

32:26.527 --> 32:28.529
that, unfortunately,
I am far too familiar with.

32:28.613 --> 32:30.615
This bill would have helped them rebuild

32:30.698 --> 32:32.700
the failing infrastructure
that surrounds them.

32:32.784 --> 32:34.202
But the Senate...

32:36.245 --> 32:39.958
-The Senate killed it.
-All they wanna do is tear things down!

32:40.041 --> 32:41.501
-[crowd clamoring]
-It makes sense to be angry.

32:41.584 --> 32:44.212
Angry like all of you are.
Hell, I am with you.

32:45.171 --> 32:47.173
But anger alone is no prescription.

32:47.882 --> 32:50.426
We need to figure out
how to take that anger

32:50.510 --> 32:52.220
and turn it into action.

32:52.845 --> 32:56.599
So please tell me, how do we fix this?

32:57.308 --> 33:00.937
-[woman 2] It's unfixable.
-Why do you say that, ma'am?

33:01.771 --> 33:04.065
-Because no one listens.
-Okay.

33:04.816 --> 33:07.610
I understand that
because I feel like that sometimes,

33:07.694 --> 33:09.195
and, hell, I'm the president
of the United States.

33:09.278 --> 33:10.613
People have to listen to me.

33:11.406 --> 33:13.658
But I felt like that in the Capitol
the other night.

33:13.741 --> 33:16.911
I felt like that today
when the Senate voted down the bill.

33:18.579 --> 33:19.956
But if I'm gonna be honest,

33:20.915 --> 33:24.877
I think all of us might be a little guilty
of not listening. Myself included.

33:26.504 --> 33:27.839
But I wanna do better.

33:28.548 --> 33:31.300
In fact, I promise you,
I am going to do better.

33:32.635 --> 33:35.471
So, ma'am, here I am.

33:36.389 --> 33:38.141
Standing right in front of you.

33:38.725 --> 33:40.393
What do you want me to hear?

33:47.108 --> 33:50.737
When the shop closed,
I tried to find other work,

33:50.820 --> 33:51.988
but there's nothing.

33:52.572 --> 33:54.824
-[man] Same for me.
-[woman] There's nothing here.

33:54.907 --> 33:57.201
These are the kind of things
that we're not addressing.

33:57.285 --> 34:01.080
Party politics are interfering
with your neighborhood.

34:01.164 --> 34:03.791
[inaudible]

34:13.968 --> 34:15.136
I love this job.

34:18.848 --> 34:20.141
Thank you.

34:20.224 --> 34:23.478
At the risk of repeating myself, sir,
you were amazing back there.

34:23.561 --> 34:26.397
Come on, Seth, it was your idea.
Give credit where credit's due.

34:27.815 --> 34:30.568
-Ms. Zimmer.
-Bum a ride?

34:34.447 --> 34:36.616
[Tom] So, weren't you supposed to be
on your way to Des Moines?

34:36.699 --> 34:40.411
I was, but Cornelius' beater of a plane
had engine trouble.

34:40.495 --> 34:45.083
And while we were waiting on repairs,
I was scrolling Twitter, like I do,

34:45.166 --> 34:49.712
and I came across a Periscope feed
from a very lively Cedar Rapids mall.

34:49.796 --> 34:51.547
I just had to check it out for myself.

34:52.131 --> 34:54.926
-Can I offer you a drink?
-No, thank you.

34:55.009 --> 34:57.386
Actually, I always bring my own.

34:57.470 --> 35:01.516
It's one of the perks
of not flying commercial. Do you partake?

35:01.599 --> 35:03.184
Tonight, why not?

35:04.060 --> 35:05.061
[Lorraine chuckles]

35:05.978 --> 35:10.983
I have a really big ego,
so I can confess when I am wrong.

35:11.067 --> 35:14.237
Washington is an echo chamber.
Time to time, I forget that.

35:14.320 --> 35:15.863
I think that what we're saying
to each other

35:15.947 --> 35:19.492
is the same thing that folks are saying
out there amongst themselves.

35:19.575 --> 35:22.787
The media made your State of the Union
out to be a self-inflicted wound.

35:22.870 --> 35:24.747
But they are wrong.

35:24.831 --> 35:27.917
What you did is really resonating
with Jane and John Q public.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.503
A-ha. My devious plan is working.

35:31.295 --> 35:34.048
Ooh, and the Tom Kirkman I saw today,

35:34.132 --> 35:37.426
with that common touch,
that empathy... [kisses]

35:38.136 --> 35:41.973
That Tom Kirkman might make
a pretty decent campaigner after all.

35:42.056 --> 35:44.433
So, am I to understand
you're no longer working with Moss?

35:44.517 --> 35:47.937
-Helping him with his dirty tricks?
-He doesn't need my help with that.

35:48.020 --> 35:50.898
This is a win-win for you.
If I manage to get elected,

35:50.982 --> 35:52.775
you'll be credited
with accomplishing something

35:52.859 --> 35:54.652
that no one has ever accomplished.

35:54.735 --> 35:59.073
And if I lose, well,
it'll be known as an unwinnable fight.

36:01.325 --> 36:04.704
I don't believe there's such a thing
as an unwinnable fight.

36:04.787 --> 36:07.915
It all depends on what you're willing
to do to come out on top.

36:08.499 --> 36:12.044
So, there are four things
that I'm gonna need from you.

36:12.128 --> 36:15.715
Number one: Unrestricted access.
I need you, I get you.

36:16.299 --> 36:21.137
Number two: I need the authority
to hire and fire all campaign staff.

36:21.220 --> 36:24.056
Their job is to get you elected,
but they work for me.

36:24.724 --> 36:28.436
And number three:
I need you to make fundraising a priority.

36:29.812 --> 36:31.814
And number four?

36:32.523 --> 36:35.026
-Fuck me, I forgot what number four is.
-[both laugh]

36:35.109 --> 36:38.196
But I reserve the right
to come back to it in the future.

36:39.030 --> 36:43.034
Okay, you're sitting down.
You wanna discuss my salary?

36:46.871 --> 36:49.540
Congratulations on Iowa, sir.
You took a chance there.

36:49.624 --> 36:51.459
And we'll be taking a lot more.

36:51.542 --> 36:54.295
And by the way, Lorraine Zimmer
decided to join our campaign.

36:54.378 --> 36:56.005
[Mars] Well, you made the most
of a tough day.

36:56.088 --> 36:59.008
We're not done yet.
I want to go around the Congress.

36:59.592 --> 37:02.678
I want you to start spitballing
an executive action on infrastructure.

37:02.762 --> 37:05.139
Reach out
to the National Economic Council,

37:05.223 --> 37:08.142
put Legal and DPC together.
Let's start hammering this out.

37:08.226 --> 37:10.144
Will do. You heading up to the Residence?

37:10.228 --> 37:12.104
One more stop. Mars, go home.

37:12.188 --> 37:14.941
I'm starting to worry that your wife
won't remember what you look like.

37:17.777 --> 37:20.863
I heard you came up
with the whole mall idea.

37:20.947 --> 37:22.907
[stutters] Well, it was sort of--

37:22.990 --> 37:25.326
I asked for a new strategy.
It seems I got one.

37:26.619 --> 37:29.664
Oh, and by the way,
I googled that "in the barrel" thing.

37:29.747 --> 37:34.669
It turns out it was a form of punishment
for petty criminals in the 19th century.

37:34.752 --> 37:37.505
They'd get put in a barrel,
holes were cut at different heights,

37:37.588 --> 37:40.258
and then men would come by
and insert their, uh...

37:40.341 --> 37:45.096
their manhoods into the holes
for various reasons.

37:45.680 --> 37:48.349
So, turns out I was wrong.

37:49.267 --> 37:54.146
Oh, and I forgot to mention,
you're the new communications director.

37:54.230 --> 37:57.191
So, I guess, report to yourself.

38:06.867 --> 38:08.035
[doorbell rings]

38:16.085 --> 38:18.754
-Can we check the premises, Ms. Rhodes?
-Sure.

38:20.047 --> 38:22.550
[agent 1] Confirm location.
All right, I'll take upstairs.

38:24.969 --> 38:27.179
-[agent 2] All clear.
-[Tom] Thank you.

38:31.309 --> 38:34.979
-Sorry about the... you know.
-It's okay. Makes me feel important.

38:35.062 --> 38:38.107
-It's nice to see you. May I?
-Of course.

38:40.609 --> 38:42.028
I saw some footage from Iowa.

38:42.111 --> 38:44.030
-Oh, yeah? What did you think?
-Mmm-hmm.

38:44.113 --> 38:46.949
It was really impressive.
You're a real man of the people.

38:47.033 --> 38:48.534
Some of the people.

38:50.953 --> 38:52.121
I'll get to the point.

38:52.872 --> 38:57.585
I came here because I wanted to tell you
that in the months since you've been gone,

38:57.668 --> 38:59.045
something's been off.

39:00.004 --> 39:01.213
With me.

39:02.590 --> 39:04.175
My compass has been off.

39:05.259 --> 39:07.970
And I would like you to come back
to the White House.

39:09.055 --> 39:11.349
Emily, I need you to keep me honest.

39:12.933 --> 39:15.644
The question I asked you at dinner,
do you know the answer?

39:17.313 --> 39:18.439
I think so.

39:20.608 --> 39:22.276
I thought a lot about what you said.

39:23.194 --> 39:27.490
And I think you're right.
I started taking things too personally.

39:27.573 --> 39:29.283
This is not about me, this is about them.

39:29.367 --> 39:32.620
I serve the American people,
even if Congress won't.

39:33.204 --> 39:36.165
Emily, we have
an historic opportunity here.

39:36.248 --> 39:41.545
I'm beholden to no one, not to any party.
We can do things they can't.

39:44.632 --> 39:45.966
So, what do you think?

39:50.096 --> 39:52.264
I serve at the pleasure of the president.

39:52.973 --> 39:55.559
[chuckles] I hate it when people say that.

39:56.644 --> 39:58.646
Great. Thank you.

40:00.439 --> 40:03.234
Your headquarters are certainly
an improvement from the bureau.

40:03.818 --> 40:07.029
I'll pass your compliment on
to the ghost of Allen Dulles.

40:08.697 --> 40:12.201
I meant to ask, whatever happened
to Agent Rennett's daughter,

40:12.284 --> 40:13.953
the girl you brought back from London?

40:14.036 --> 40:15.955
She's with family friends.

40:17.039 --> 40:19.166
So, you were surveilling me, too.

40:19.250 --> 40:20.876
It's what we do.

40:20.960 --> 40:24.463
And why were you tailing Emily?
Did you suspect her of something?

40:24.547 --> 40:28.634
No. I'd be very surprised if Ms. Rhodes
was a traitor to her country.

40:28.717 --> 40:30.845
Then what was in the envelope?

40:30.928 --> 40:33.347
She mentioned something
about a back channel with Russia,

40:33.431 --> 40:34.807
but that's all I could get out of her.

40:35.850 --> 40:40.354
The US and Russia occasionally share
information about rogue scientists,

40:40.438 --> 40:44.066
especially ones who have access
to classified weapons programs.

40:44.150 --> 40:46.235
So, this is about nuclear technology.

40:47.069 --> 40:51.365
It can be. But we're on to something
more insidious now.

40:51.949 --> 40:52.825
What's that?

40:52.908 --> 40:55.744
Bioterror.
It's what I want you to work on.

40:57.121 --> 40:58.497
Where are you sending me?

41:01.250 --> 41:02.835
-Hey.
-[Isabel] Hey.

41:04.628 --> 41:06.755
-I got you something.
-Takeout?

41:06.839 --> 41:09.008
It's from La Casa del Mofongo.

41:10.885 --> 41:13.220
You went all the way to Silver Spring
for mofongo?

41:13.304 --> 41:14.180
No, for you.

41:17.641 --> 41:18.934
Do you think I'm mad at you?

41:19.768 --> 41:23.564
I don't know. It's just...
The way the bill turned out today--

41:23.647 --> 41:25.024
You tried, right?

41:26.734 --> 41:28.068
I'm not mad at you.

41:30.738 --> 41:31.780
All right, good.

41:33.073 --> 41:35.951
Good, because there's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

41:37.369 --> 41:39.788
Look, we've been together
a little while now.

41:40.414 --> 41:43.876
And I'm usually
a "look before you leap" kind of guy.

41:44.668 --> 41:46.921
But I come home and you're here...

41:47.922 --> 41:51.467
You're here and I like it.
I like coming home to you.

41:52.426 --> 41:54.678
So, I was thinking, you know, maybe...

41:57.640 --> 41:59.767
Maybe you should move in.

42:00.768 --> 42:02.895
[speaking Spanish]

42:06.565 --> 42:08.651
I thought you were gonna ask me
to marry you.

42:09.360 --> 42:10.444
[chuckles]

42:15.866 --> 42:16.700
Um...

42:17.409 --> 42:19.036
Can I think about it?

42:21.080 --> 42:22.790
Yeah, of course you can.

42:29.505 --> 42:30.589
Can we eat this food?

42:33.384 --> 42:35.761
I'm not a mofongo kind of guy, really.

42:35.844 --> 42:38.305
Bitch, you better learn to be.

42:43.394 --> 42:46.188
Did you forward the links to the president
that we talked about?

42:46.272 --> 42:48.816
Yeah, I sent them
to the address you gave me.

42:48.899 --> 42:51.652
I changed the hashtag, though.
I think it's better.

42:52.736 --> 42:55.531
Man, I started the day thinking
I was gonna get fired

42:55.614 --> 42:58.867
-and I ended the day getting promoted.
-[Dontae chuckles]

42:59.451 --> 43:01.704
I started the day
as a low-ranking specialist

43:01.787 --> 43:03.414
in the Office of Digital Strategy.

43:03.497 --> 43:05.874
I ended the day
as director of online engagement.

43:05.958 --> 43:09.712
-[laughs] Nice try, Dontae.
-It's worth a shot. [chuckles]

43:09.795 --> 43:13.007
Hey, tomorrow, though, I want you
to pack up your desk in the EEOB

43:13.090 --> 43:16.302
and head over to the West Wing.
You work for me now.

43:16.844 --> 43:18.012
[doorbell jingles]

43:26.979 --> 43:28.105
Oh, shit.

43:29.440 --> 43:30.399
What's wrong?

43:30.983 --> 43:31.984
My parents.

43:32.985 --> 43:33.944
They're dead.

43:34.862 --> 43:37.114
Seth, I'm so sorry, man.

43:37.197 --> 43:40.242
That's okay. I never knew them.

43:40.909 --> 43:42.578
Hey, I'm Seth.

43:42.661 --> 43:45.164
Mike. I'm Dontae's boyfriend.

43:45.247 --> 43:46.832
Yeah, I figured. Have a seat.

43:46.915 --> 43:49.877
Let me buy you two
intimidatingly fit gentlemen a drink.

43:56.800 --> 43:58.552
[sighs] Lynn?

44:05.059 --> 44:06.060
Lynn?

44:12.399 --> 44:15.527
God damn it, Lynn, what'd you do? Come on.

44:16.362 --> 44:17.363
Lynn?

44:17.863 --> 44:18.781
[Lynn] Mmm.

44:23.827 --> 44:25.829
[Mars breathing heavily]

44:51.605 --> 44:52.481
[man] Mmm.

44:54.233 --> 44:57.778
Is this a good scotch?
I was thinking I should develop a taste.

44:57.861 --> 45:00.280
Doll, you're totally off the clock.

45:02.783 --> 45:03.659
Super great.

45:13.419 --> 45:14.336
[sniffs]

45:15.879 --> 45:17.381
You couldn't afford this scotch.

45:36.483 --> 45:37.609
Hey, sweetheart.

45:40.946 --> 45:42.156
[Penny] I missed you today.

45:44.324 --> 45:45.325
I missed you, too.

45:47.244 --> 45:53.375
And if you're gonna be gone more often,
like you said...

45:53.459 --> 45:54.668
Yeah?

45:57.463 --> 46:00.674
I was wondering if I could get a dog.

46:01.341 --> 46:05.512
[chuckles] I didn't realize
you were such a good politician.

46:06.805 --> 46:10.350
-I mean, you love dogs, too, don't you?
-Mmm-hmm.

46:10.434 --> 46:13.687
-And people love presidents who have dogs.
-Yes, they do.

46:14.396 --> 46:15.481
[chuckles softly]

46:17.232 --> 46:19.234
I will think about it, Little P.

46:22.696 --> 46:23.864
Dad?

46:27.284 --> 46:29.453
Can you not call me Little P anymore?

46:31.663 --> 46:32.539
Okay.

46:35.209 --> 46:36.502
Okay. I love you.

46:36.585 --> 46:38.003
I love you, too.

46:38.837 --> 46:41.632
-Go to bed.
-Hmm.

46:53.143 --> 46:54.061
[blows on hands]

47:18.085 --> 47:20.837
[man 1 on video] <i>I'm most concerned</i>
<i>about gun control in this country.</i>

47:20.921 --> 47:25.259
<i>And I actually lost a cousin</i>
<i>to suicide last year with a gun.</i>

47:25.342 --> 47:27.219
<i>So, it's a big issue for me.</i>

47:27.302 --> 47:29.805
