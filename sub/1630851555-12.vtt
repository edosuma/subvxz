00:06.006 --> 00:09.217
My mom knows no one outside the convent.
Where would she go?

00:09.300 --> 00:10.135
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:10.218 --> 00:11.720
Didn't Teresa see her leave?

00:11.803 --> 00:15.682
No, and the Mother Superior says
she didn't sleep in her room.

00:15.765 --> 00:18.143
What if something happened to her?

00:18.226 --> 00:22.605
Let's not jump to conclusions
until Lorenzo calls, please.

00:22.689 --> 00:23.648
Who told you?

00:23.732 --> 00:27.360
Mother Superior called Caridad.
How did you find out?

00:27.444 --> 00:31.656
How did Mother Superior know
someone tried to kill Rogelio last night?

00:42.375 --> 00:44.252
We don't know who attacked him.

00:44.335 --> 00:46.504
He was unconscious
when the ambulance came.

00:47.005 --> 00:51.217
Rogelio is a tough guy.
He will be fine, you'll see.

00:52.385 --> 00:53.219
Wait.

00:56.765 --> 00:57.599
Fede.

00:58.475 --> 00:59.642
Thanks for coming.

01:00.518 --> 01:02.020
Sorry, I know it was late,

01:02.103 --> 01:06.149
but you were the first person
that came to mind.

01:06.733 --> 01:08.068
No problem.

01:08.151 --> 01:12.363
Rogelio is my father-in-law
so it's my duty to be here.

01:13.990 --> 01:14.824
Thanks.

01:17.452 --> 01:18.495
Go right ahead.

01:18.578 --> 01:19.537
What happened?

01:19.621 --> 01:23.124
The female worker that found him
saw nothing.

01:23.208 --> 01:24.626
I was asleep, Fede.

01:26.544 --> 01:27.796
I'm so angry!

01:28.296 --> 01:29.297
It's not your fault.

01:30.423 --> 01:31.257
Take it easy.

01:33.718 --> 01:35.804
How is he, Doctor?

01:37.263 --> 01:39.099
Well…

01:39.182 --> 01:41.392
It's not a deep wound.

01:41.476 --> 01:45.396
We were able to repair his liver.
You can see him in a while.

01:46.314 --> 01:48.817
Thank you so much, Doctor.

01:48.900 --> 01:52.612
-You're welcome. Alice?
-Excuse me? No.

01:52.695 --> 01:56.533
He asked about Alice
and he looked worried.

01:58.785 --> 02:00.870
Why would she do that?

02:01.371 --> 02:04.874
Alice has mental issues.

02:04.958 --> 02:08.837
Who knows what crazy ideas
occurred to her.

02:09.838 --> 02:10.880
Where is Ignacio?

02:11.548 --> 02:14.884
With Federico
taking care of the insurance papers.

02:17.178 --> 02:21.766
Regretting they're not
my funeral arrangements no doubt.

02:25.728 --> 02:27.605
Rogelio, please don't say that.

02:29.023 --> 02:30.150
He's your son.

02:30.233 --> 02:31.651
So was Simón.

02:34.112 --> 02:37.157
My two biggest disappointments, damn it!

02:40.326 --> 02:44.247
I'll get the water.
Can you stay a moment, Víctor?

02:48.418 --> 02:49.294
Any news?

02:49.794 --> 02:53.131
No, Boss, the cops want to see
the surveillance footage.

02:55.341 --> 02:56.301
Give it to them.

02:57.427 --> 02:58.845
All that will prove

02:58.928 --> 03:03.474
is that the stupid old hag
is stark-raving mad.

03:05.143 --> 03:08.188
Just find her before they do.
I won't have her talking.

03:09.689 --> 03:10.523
Yes, Boss.

03:13.818 --> 03:18.406
Alice took a cab shortly before midnight
to a house nearby.

03:19.574 --> 03:20.950
We're getting the address.

03:21.451 --> 03:23.786
Maybe she lost her way
looking for the house.

03:24.954 --> 03:26.539
Why didn't she call?

03:26.623 --> 03:28.458
My mom doesn't have a phone.

03:36.549 --> 03:40.178
My entire team is searching for her.
I promise we'll find her.

03:47.727 --> 03:48.561
Yes?

03:49.687 --> 03:50.939
Where's Caridad?

03:51.648 --> 03:53.316
In the garden with Lorenzo.

03:54.817 --> 03:55.652
What's that?

03:58.905 --> 03:59.864
It's Alice's.

04:01.115 --> 04:03.534
I touched it to try to locate her, but…

04:04.035 --> 04:05.536
Alice is who attacked Rogelio.

04:25.848 --> 04:26.975
Detective Márquez.

04:27.475 --> 04:29.352
I have bad news.

04:43.741 --> 04:48.288
She committed suicide, Boss.
They found her in a gorge without a phone.

04:49.038 --> 04:52.625
The police say she died around midnight.

05:04.595 --> 05:08.057
They'll think it was a fit of madness.
Don't worry.

05:09.267 --> 05:10.310
You're safe.

05:12.520 --> 05:15.273
The bastard is killing women
even from the grave.

05:16.816 --> 05:19.152
I hope he rots in hell!

05:19.235 --> 05:21.446
Her final thoughts were terrible.

05:23.614 --> 05:25.491
But I couldn't tell Caridad.

05:26.617 --> 05:27.618
What did you see?

05:29.537 --> 05:30.538
Grief.

05:32.290 --> 05:33.833
As if life was a burden and…

05:34.667 --> 05:35.543
What else?

05:38.087 --> 05:38.963
Rogelio's ring.

05:43.426 --> 05:44.677
Safe?

05:45.970 --> 05:49.557
So I thought when I took you in
after what Simón did.

05:51.225 --> 05:55.772
If it weren't for me,
you'd be rotting in jail, Víctor.

05:58.232 --> 06:01.903
Instead, you're enjoying more
than you could ever achieve.

06:03.112 --> 06:06.074
I swear I won't let you down, Boss.

06:08.785 --> 06:09.911
I swear to God.

06:18.711 --> 06:20.338
She's so beautiful.

06:22.173 --> 06:26.677
She has a tattoo just like your birthmark.
When did she get it?

06:30.723 --> 06:34.560
The Mother Superior says a few days
before she was found drugged.

06:35.645 --> 06:36.979
When I was a baby.

06:39.357 --> 06:40.691
She also used to say…

06:43.111 --> 06:46.364
that my birthmark
was the only thing we didn't share.

06:48.449 --> 06:51.619
But she didn't remember any of that
these last few months.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.415
Let alone her own past.

07:00.128 --> 07:02.422
Mom was at war with her own mind.

07:08.594 --> 07:12.640
But it's all over, Mom.
You can rest in peace now.

07:13.141 --> 07:15.226
I will always love you.

07:55.349 --> 07:56.809
Can't sleep again?

07:58.060 --> 08:01.105
I can move in with my parents
until I find a place.

08:01.189 --> 08:02.148
Of course not.

08:02.231 --> 08:06.861
Look, we just met two months ago.

08:06.944 --> 08:10.281
We're not used to sharing our space.

08:11.908 --> 08:14.243
Maybe that's why you can't sleep.

08:14.744 --> 08:16.162
It's not that at all.

08:17.788 --> 08:19.081
I don't want to be alone.

08:19.790 --> 08:23.294
Look, let's close this and…

08:23.377 --> 08:24.295
And what? No!

08:24.921 --> 08:26.380
And go back this way.

08:27.882 --> 08:29.050
No! Stop!

08:47.652 --> 08:50.154
Honestly, when it came to Alice's funeral…

08:50.905 --> 08:54.992
Manny never introduced me to them,
so I didn't go, but you're family.

08:55.868 --> 08:57.495
But I'd rather stay away.

08:58.371 --> 09:01.874
Fede, the more you speak with Valentina,

09:01.958 --> 09:05.211
the more she'll be family
and less a romantic partner.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.839
-What if it's the opposite?
-What if it's not?

09:08.923 --> 09:10.299
I'd rather not risk it.

09:11.008 --> 09:16.722
Fede, 30 people have confirmed,
35 if your sisters come.

09:17.306 --> 09:19.016
It's my chance to meet them.

09:20.476 --> 09:21.310
So?

09:22.853 --> 09:24.605
Fede. It's for you.

09:25.231 --> 09:28.025
Tell them I'll take it. Wait here.

09:31.904 --> 09:34.031
Are they really on such bad terms?

09:34.907 --> 09:36.826
I can't even mention them.

09:36.909 --> 09:41.497
It's kind of hard for him.
He only met them three months ago.

09:43.082 --> 09:45.626
Is it because of his dad's suicide?

09:46.877 --> 09:49.130
He doesn't talk about that either,
obviously.

09:59.515 --> 10:00.933
We need to talk, Valentina.

10:03.019 --> 10:04.145
You're the Tinder guy?

10:04.729 --> 10:08.399
You use Tinder, so you know your info
is all over the world.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.569
Come closer. They can see you.

10:12.612 --> 10:13.613
Come.

10:14.780 --> 10:17.700
Go to this address at this date and time.

10:18.576 --> 10:19.869
We need to talk.

10:19.952 --> 10:22.121
Not until you tell me who you are.

10:23.039 --> 10:25.416
Not here. They're listening.

10:33.341 --> 10:34.300
It's about Adelita.

10:42.433 --> 10:44.685
We don't have much time. See you there.

10:52.860 --> 10:54.445
Is something wrong?

10:55.237 --> 10:56.947
I'm kind of rusty, but…

10:57.031 --> 10:58.908
No, on the contrary.

11:00.201 --> 11:03.954
I don't know how you fixed
my accounting mess.

11:05.039 --> 11:06.374
Thanks, Susana.

11:06.999 --> 11:09.377
I hope you call me Aunt again one day.

11:09.960 --> 11:12.755
I'm not whining. It's your right.

11:13.506 --> 11:16.592
And you hired me
because my sister asked you to.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.094
I appreciate that.

11:18.177 --> 11:21.055
First and foremost,
that's not why I hired you.

11:21.764 --> 11:23.140
You're obviously a pro,

11:24.308 --> 11:27.228
and I'm not calling you Aunt
because we're at the office.

11:28.646 --> 11:31.691
-Fede.
-What?

11:31.774 --> 11:36.654
Sorry. The caterers need to know
how many people to serve.

11:36.737 --> 11:37.655
Well?

11:42.201 --> 11:47.081
-I can't go, Bautista.
-He wants to normalize our relationship.

11:47.665 --> 11:49.667
My relationship with him
is far from normal,

11:50.167 --> 11:52.878
and going to his opening
won't change anything.

11:54.630 --> 11:56.590
Need anything before I leave?

11:56.674 --> 11:59.593
Yolanda, where are the keys to the shed?

12:00.094 --> 12:02.221
I need to switch the hot tub on.

12:02.805 --> 12:05.474
Only Víctor is allowed in there.
Boss's orders.

12:05.558 --> 12:06.892
I'll ask him tomorrow.

12:06.976 --> 12:09.770
Never mind. Thanks.

12:09.854 --> 12:12.314
-See you tomorrow,
-Thanks. Bye.

12:15.818 --> 12:18.279
-What's with the coat?
-You can borrow it anytime.

12:19.697 --> 12:22.533
I'm going with Caridad
to see Rogelio tomorrow.

12:23.451 --> 12:26.078
You're still intrigued by Alice's vision.

12:26.162 --> 12:29.749
Isn't it weird
that was the last thing she thought about?

12:30.458 --> 12:35.921
My dear sisters!
I found another piece under the door mat!

12:40.426 --> 12:41.260
Rogelio.

12:41.761 --> 12:46.807
Víctor said you were discharged,
so I came to see how you're doing.

12:46.891 --> 12:49.477
You scared the hell out of me!

12:51.979 --> 12:55.107
Stop playing dumb, Suárez.
It's all your fault.

12:59.904 --> 13:03.616
Twenty years ago I ordered you
to get rid of a girl.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.409
A simple order.

13:06.285 --> 13:10.706
And two weeks later
she ended up in a clinic from an overdose.

13:11.624 --> 13:15.127
But alive.
And you call it a miscalculation?

13:15.628 --> 13:16.629
Well, you see…

13:17.254 --> 13:21.467
Forcing me to have her confined
to prevent her from recovering.

13:23.177 --> 13:24.011
I apologized.

13:24.094 --> 13:27.264
Then 20 years later
the same broad tries to kill me,

13:27.890 --> 13:30.434
after remembering stuff
she's not supposed to.

13:34.522 --> 13:35.689
Speak up, man!

13:37.483 --> 13:38.609
I want the truth.

13:40.861 --> 13:42.154
Adelita?

13:42.780 --> 13:44.406
Ana's code name.

13:45.074 --> 13:48.494
To honor the women
of the Mexican Revolution.

13:48.577 --> 13:50.955
Only she and I knew her alias.

13:52.373 --> 13:54.542
Not telling you her name might be a trap.

13:55.584 --> 13:56.794
He might know something.

13:57.378 --> 14:00.756
You know we've heard nothing
for over five months.

14:01.507 --> 14:02.341
Look.

14:04.051 --> 14:05.177
He wants to meet here.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.057
It's a truck depot.

14:11.517 --> 14:14.895
-I'm coming with you.
-No, he's paranoid, he'll leave.

14:14.979 --> 14:18.858
-That's what cellphones are for.
-You'll ruin it for me.

14:19.441 --> 14:20.359
-Hi.
-Hi.

14:21.694 --> 14:22.528
Hi.

14:23.779 --> 14:24.697
I wasn't expecting you.

14:25.281 --> 14:28.951
Just for a while.
Keeping myself busy is good for me.

14:29.034 --> 14:30.828
-Right.
-What are you talking about?

14:31.412 --> 14:32.246
-About…
-A…

14:32.830 --> 14:35.374
An article I'm writing.

14:36.792 --> 14:38.043
See you there.

14:49.930 --> 14:52.224
-The beer's here. Can you get it?
-Sure.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.398
Pedrito, just five orders this month,

14:59.481 --> 15:03.027
because we're broke
and you won't give us a discount.

15:05.112 --> 15:06.071
Hi, gorgeous.

15:07.448 --> 15:08.490
Like my new job?

15:09.742 --> 15:11.160
Where did you move to?

15:11.243 --> 15:13.078
None of your business. Get lost.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.414
I love you, Matilde. I won't--

15:15.497 --> 15:16.457
Don't touch me.

15:16.540 --> 15:19.585
You love me so much
that you poisoned Daniel's dog?

15:20.085 --> 15:21.921
What? I didn't do anything.

15:22.004 --> 15:27.092
No? First a rat, then the dog.
Get lost, or I'm calling the cops.

15:27.676 --> 15:28.594
Matilde.

15:50.115 --> 15:54.203
We're never ordering
that brand of beer again, ever.

16:19.603 --> 16:20.437
Caridad.

16:21.939 --> 16:24.358
I'm so sorry about your mother's death.

16:33.117 --> 16:34.368
It's all my fault.

16:36.495 --> 16:38.664
The thing about the house upset her a lot.

16:39.957 --> 16:41.291
How can you say that?

16:42.960 --> 16:44.586
You're way too generous.

16:45.254 --> 16:49.133
You'd have every right
to not even want to see me.

16:53.303 --> 16:55.305
We're having tea in the garden.

16:55.389 --> 16:58.350
I can't, thank you. I'm going to work.

16:58.434 --> 16:59.476
I'll stay.

17:00.144 --> 17:02.896
We found another jigsaw puzzle piece
last night.

17:04.773 --> 17:06.859
Precisely now. What are the odds?

17:07.401 --> 17:08.235
Precisely now?

17:10.404 --> 17:11.613
What does that mean?

17:12.906 --> 17:16.827
Never mind me. I'm always linking events.

17:16.910 --> 17:18.370
It's a habit I can't break.

17:18.954 --> 17:21.165
I'm so glad you're feeling better.

17:25.711 --> 17:26.879
No, he was discharged.

17:28.047 --> 17:31.050
But I really don't want to visit him.

17:32.468 --> 17:34.511
I got him a box of chocolates.

17:36.096 --> 17:39.516
I went to see him.
He was talking with some politician.

17:39.600 --> 17:43.854
I can imagine the line of senators
and congressmen.

17:43.937 --> 17:47.941
-Right.
-Those are his favorites. The bootlickers.

17:52.863 --> 17:54.114
Why don't you get along?

17:57.076 --> 18:00.120
He was a cold, cruel father.

18:02.164 --> 18:06.960
He is incapable of feeling any empathy
for anything or anyone.

18:08.087 --> 18:11.090
He even has to fake
the most basic emotions.

18:12.466 --> 18:13.675
So it's genetic.

18:15.135 --> 18:15.969
Yes.

18:18.222 --> 18:20.265
Then your generation got it, even worse.

18:21.725 --> 18:22.726
Look who's talking.

18:23.894 --> 18:27.856
No, I'm glad you guys are there.
It's quite the contrary.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.442
Excuse me.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.653
With or without balloons?

18:32.736 --> 18:35.364
-Whatever you say, honey.
-No balloons.

18:35.447 --> 18:37.199
She's crazy over you, right?

18:38.200 --> 18:39.660
She's a great woman.

18:41.161 --> 18:43.789
A great woman?

18:46.667 --> 18:49.211
I haven't lost hope
of falling in love again.

18:53.882 --> 18:56.218
She said some crazy things.

18:57.094 --> 18:58.345
That it was all my fault.

18:59.555 --> 19:01.306
Over and over.

19:04.601 --> 19:06.061
Why did she open her blouse?

19:06.937 --> 19:07.938
I don't know.

19:10.149 --> 19:14.027
Maybe she thought
she was speaking with Simón.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.823
My son did her a lot of harm.

19:20.701 --> 19:21.535
May I?

19:24.538 --> 19:26.665
I'd like to do more for you.

19:29.084 --> 19:29.918
I don't know.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.755
Covering your tuition, for example.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.426
Or helping you open your own business.

19:40.262 --> 19:41.638
You've done enough.

19:42.973 --> 19:43.807
Grandpa.

19:44.892 --> 19:49.980
If money wasn't an issue,
what would you like to do?

19:51.940 --> 19:54.526
What's your passion?
There must be something.

19:56.612 --> 20:00.282
Here's the rest of the rent
and a month in advance.

20:01.366 --> 20:06.997
Are you doing home visits, or what?
Because business is slow here.

20:07.915 --> 20:08.749
No.

20:09.666 --> 20:11.210
It's an…

20:12.252 --> 20:13.170
inheritance.

20:14.630 --> 20:16.465
God bless your family.

20:40.781 --> 20:42.908
Has anyone told you you're gorgeous?

20:45.160 --> 20:46.662
She looks like a model.

20:47.496 --> 20:48.580
Take off the bra.

20:59.341 --> 21:00.175
Hello?

21:00.717 --> 21:01.843
Hello?

21:02.970 --> 21:03.887
Hello.

21:49.057 --> 21:51.435
I can't get you out of my mind, Valentina.

21:52.978 --> 21:54.062
You must be mine.

21:59.192 --> 22:00.569
We're going, Val!

22:03.989 --> 22:05.449
You two look beautiful.

22:06.074 --> 22:07.951
-Thanks.
-Where's Manny?

22:08.035 --> 22:11.330
She's going straight there.
Caridad is staying with Lorenzo.

22:12.080 --> 22:13.457
Sure you're not coming?

22:15.167 --> 22:17.711
Positive, if anyone asks about me--

22:17.794 --> 22:21.214
-I'll make up an excuse. No worries.
-Thanks.

22:21.798 --> 22:22.716
-Kisses.
-Bye.

22:26.094 --> 22:30.474
Val, the only way to stop our ghosts
from scaring us is facing them.

22:33.977 --> 22:38.148
No, we'll go with this one, please.
Yes, take this one, thanks.

22:53.205 --> 22:54.039
Hi.

22:54.664 --> 22:55.540
Hi.

22:56.625 --> 22:58.627
Excuse me. Have we met somewhere?

23:01.505 --> 23:03.215
-May I?
-Sure.

23:05.675 --> 23:06.676
What stone is it?

23:08.553 --> 23:09.471
An opal.

23:10.430 --> 23:11.390
Beautiful.

23:13.517 --> 23:14.893
-Sorry.
-No.

23:15.644 --> 23:18.146
Hi, Manny. I see you met my girlfriend.

23:23.485 --> 23:24.986
Yes.

23:25.070 --> 23:27.656
Manny is one of my sisters.

23:31.368 --> 23:33.453
-Nice to finally meet you.
-You too.

23:33.537 --> 23:35.163
-Mateo needs us.
-But…

23:35.247 --> 23:37.833
-It's urgent. Come.
-Okay. Nice meeting you.

24:29.134 --> 24:31.845
-Have you been to the office, Susi?
-Yes, I saw…

24:31.928 --> 24:32.804
Oh, look.

24:34.389 --> 24:36.850
-You look gorgeous.
-You too.

24:37.601 --> 24:38.560
-Hi.
-Hi.

24:39.227 --> 24:40.729
You look stunning.

24:40.812 --> 24:43.648
Thanks. This is beautiful.

24:43.732 --> 24:44.566
Honey!

24:44.649 --> 24:47.527
-How are you?
-Excited for you.

24:47.611 --> 24:51.698
-Auntie, can I steal you for a second?
-Sure.

24:52.324 --> 24:53.492
I need your help.

24:57.996 --> 25:00.290
You do. You look gorgeous.

25:01.082 --> 25:02.000
Thanks.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.091
Let's stop playing dumb.

25:13.470 --> 25:18.558
Catalina, I didn't return to Mexico
for the brewery or Federico.

25:19.559 --> 25:22.229
I came back to be with you.

25:23.522 --> 25:27.108
Then maybe
you shouldn't have returned, right?

25:30.695 --> 25:31.530
Catalina.

25:33.490 --> 25:34.407
Wait.

25:36.868 --> 25:41.206
You won't convince me that what happened
at the ranch was a mistake.

25:41.790 --> 25:43.583
Although it was 25 years ago.

25:44.584 --> 25:46.586
Ignacio, you just don't get it.

25:46.670 --> 25:50.465
I'm your brother's widow.
What would people think?

25:51.466 --> 25:54.302
-Catalina, people fall in love.
-Oh, Ignacio!

26:06.398 --> 26:09.693
You know you feel the same way.
I'll never give up.

26:14.781 --> 26:18.994
-Catalina.
-Hi. You look gorgeous.

26:19.744 --> 26:20.829
Where's Caridad?

26:20.912 --> 26:23.623
She didn't come. She's still very sad.

26:23.707 --> 26:25.709
Valentina stayed with her.

26:26.376 --> 26:29.004
I'm sorry, tell her I'll pay her a visit
next week.

26:30.255 --> 26:34.342
Switching to a nicer topic,
did you like the beer?

26:34.426 --> 26:36.303
It's fabulous.

26:36.386 --> 26:37.512
It is. Isn't it?

26:37.596 --> 26:41.349
Catalina.
Why don't you promote it at Bar Fénix?

26:42.058 --> 26:44.311
-Sounds great.
-It sure does.

26:44.394 --> 26:46.396
-Coming?
-No, thanks.

26:46.479 --> 26:49.274
I'll introduce you to an expert
on all of this.

26:49.357 --> 26:50.400
Come, Isabel.

26:50.483 --> 26:53.194
Meet Matilde. She has a great idea.

26:53.278 --> 26:54.112
How are you?

26:54.195 --> 26:56.906
You just got your first exclusivity deal.

26:56.990 --> 26:57.991
I bet.

26:59.659 --> 27:02.537
-Thanks for the invite, Fede.
-Thanks for coming.

27:03.330 --> 27:07.500
I've wanted to visit Caridad,
but I was busy with all this.

27:08.084 --> 27:09.252
Tell her I'll visit soon.

27:13.173 --> 27:16.509
I'll try to leave as soon as I can and…

27:18.094 --> 27:19.763
by the way, your outfit

27:20.597 --> 27:21.973
is driving me crazy.

27:23.183 --> 27:24.392
-Really?
-Yes.

27:26.728 --> 27:30.315
-Hi. We need to get started.
-Now? Okay.

27:33.234 --> 27:34.569
Sorry, it's up there.

27:35.862 --> 27:37.697
Okay.

27:40.033 --> 27:41.743
Well, I'll leave you two.

27:50.669 --> 27:51.670
Let's go.

27:53.546 --> 27:55.715
Valentina's not coming, is she?

27:57.676 --> 27:58.802
What's Isabel like?

27:59.427 --> 28:01.262
Nice. Smart.

28:02.138 --> 28:03.098
Why?

28:03.682 --> 28:05.600
Nothing. Just curious.

28:06.226 --> 28:10.146
Hello everyone. Good evening and welcome.

28:15.944 --> 28:18.905
After so many years of imagining,

28:18.988 --> 28:21.032
of working for his dream,

28:21.116 --> 28:22.617
the day finally arrived.

28:22.701 --> 28:25.495
Let's have a big round of applause

28:25.578 --> 28:28.957
for the man without whom
none of this would be possible.

28:29.040 --> 28:32.669
So let's hear it for Federico Marroquín.

28:33.169 --> 28:35.046
Bravo, honey!

28:36.673 --> 28:38.425
Thank you very much.

28:40.510 --> 28:43.304
Thank you very much
for being here this evening.

28:43.388 --> 28:47.267
It means a lot to me
and everyone behind this project.

28:48.059 --> 28:51.229
I'd like to thank
the most important woman in my life,

28:51.312 --> 28:55.608
my mom, Catalina Bravo,
for her unconditional love.

28:56.401 --> 28:59.028
She trusts me
even if I don't trust myself.

28:59.112 --> 29:01.823
Thank you so much, Mom.
Let's hear it for her.

29:02.657 --> 29:04.743
I wouldn't be here if not for you, Mom.

29:07.620 --> 29:09.748
I also have to thank my uncle,

29:09.831 --> 29:14.043
who provided the guidance and the tools
to make this possible.

29:14.127 --> 29:16.421
Let's hear it for my uncle too.

29:48.536 --> 29:52.040
-I'm not sure I can stop loving you.
-Me neither.

29:57.879 --> 30:02.842
Allow me to introduce you to my dream,
and sometimes my nightmare.

30:04.219 --> 30:07.680
It's inspired by… a woman.

30:17.106 --> 30:20.693
A woman who, like so many in this country,
deserves a tribute.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.613
I give you The Woman of Courage.

30:28.159 --> 30:31.371
THE WOMAN OF COURAGE

30:57.981 --> 31:01.025
-Woman of Courage?
-Easy. They don't know it's you.

31:01.609 --> 31:04.195
It's the most romantic thing ever!

31:22.714 --> 31:23.965
Want some tequila?

31:27.677 --> 31:30.972
I'm not a beer person
and you look like you need it.

31:46.821 --> 31:48.907
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

31:51.659 --> 31:54.787
We can have another somewhere else
if you want.

31:58.625 --> 32:01.419
I can't. I have to work.

32:05.298 --> 32:06.132
Hey.

32:09.469 --> 32:10.553
Maybe another day?

32:14.223 --> 32:15.058
Thanks.

32:18.895 --> 32:20.647
I need to go.

32:21.147 --> 32:24.067
You can stay to sign the labels.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.111
Just kidding.

32:27.612 --> 32:32.700
I can't believe I had to wait three months
to finally meet you guys.

32:32.784 --> 32:33.868
I'm Camilo.

32:35.703 --> 32:37.830
Right? Manny's secret lover?

32:40.249 --> 32:42.460
-I know you.
-From where?

32:43.962 --> 32:44.796
I don't know.

32:47.674 --> 32:51.302
Well, I have an unforgettable face.
Don't you think?

32:51.970 --> 32:55.598
-Where do you know Manny from?
-You're so dapper.

32:56.140 --> 33:01.145
Okay, I promised Caridad I'd leave soon.
Congratulations.

33:01.229 --> 33:02.438
Thanks.

33:03.564 --> 33:05.650
Great beer.

33:07.527 --> 33:08.528
Nice to meet you.

33:08.611 --> 33:09.904
Yeah, it took hard work.

33:11.322 --> 33:14.242
You could've told me
it was inspired by Valentina.

33:14.826 --> 33:16.119
I know.

33:33.803 --> 33:36.139
I tried to change the name and logo.

33:36.639 --> 33:38.182
But it was too late.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.101
I realize that.

33:41.519 --> 33:43.146
I don't see why you invited me.

33:44.939 --> 33:48.985
I didn't think you'd come,
and Isabel wanted to meet my sisters.

33:49.861 --> 33:53.448
I wasn't going to.
I don't know what I was thinking.

33:59.037 --> 34:03.458
Maybe it's for the best, right?
We can't avoid each other forever.

34:04.292 --> 34:07.795
Sooner or later we'll have to accept
that we're siblings.

34:08.421 --> 34:11.049
-Right?
-Yes. I know we're siblings.

34:11.132 --> 34:13.092
You got that clear, right?

34:13.176 --> 34:14.260
-Got it.
-Good.

34:14.343 --> 34:15.887
What's your problem?

35:14.362 --> 35:15.571
Goddamnit.

35:18.825 --> 35:20.118
Fuck this.

36:55.922 --> 36:58.132
