00:11.136 --> 00:12.763
Whoever those aliens are,
they haven't just arrived,

00:12.846 --> 00:14.046
they've been here for a while.

00:14.264 --> 00:16.437
Harriet Jones,
MP for Flydale North.

00:16.683 --> 00:19.357
I thought
I was Prime Minister now.

00:30.447 --> 00:33.792
Thank you all for wearing
your ID cards.

00:35.410 --> 00:37.663
They'll help to identify
the bodies.

00:56.306 --> 00:58.274
Deadly to humans, maybe.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.048
Ah!

02:17.346 --> 02:18.723
Jackie!

02:36.865 --> 02:38.117
Oi, you want aliens,
you've got them.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.498
They're inside Downing Street.
Come on.

02:53.423 --> 02:56.802
Reinstate my disguise!
Hurry up, hurry! Hurry!

03:00.263 --> 03:01.560
No, wait!

03:01.640 --> 03:05.440
They're still in there,
the Emergency Protocols, we need them.

03:32.129 --> 03:33.255
Where've you been?

03:34.631 --> 03:37.851
I called for help,
I sounded the alarm.

03:37.968 --> 03:44.522
There was this lightning, a kind of
electricity, and they all collapsed.

03:46.268 --> 03:47.485
I think they're all dead.

03:47.978 --> 03:49.901
That's what I'm saying.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.983
He did it! That man there!

03:53.108 --> 03:57.033
I think you'll find
the Prime Minister is an alien in disguise.

03:59.156 --> 04:00.533
That's never gonna work, is it?

04:00.657 --> 04:01.704
No.

04:01.783 --> 04:03.080
Fair enough.

04:06.830 --> 04:08.582
Down there!

04:14.921 --> 04:17.470
Under the jurisdiction
of the Emergency Protocols,

04:17.548 --> 04:20.519
I authorise you
to execute this man!

04:21.094 --> 04:24.439
Well, now, yes, you see, uh,
the thing is,

04:24.514 --> 04:27.438
if I was you, if I was gonna
execute someone

04:27.517 --> 04:29.519
by backing him up
against the wall, between you and me,

04:29.603 --> 04:31.401
- little word of advice,

04:31.480 --> 04:33.198
don't stand him
against the lift.

04:45.202 --> 04:46.203
Hello!

04:56.505 --> 04:57.631
Hide!

05:08.558 --> 05:11.732
I repeat, the upper ﬂoors
are under quarantine.

05:11.812 --> 05:14.986
You will stay where you are, you will
disregard all previous instructions,

05:15.065 --> 05:17.659
and you will take your orders
directly from me.

05:20.529 --> 05:22.827
Mr Green, sir, sorry,
but you've got to come with me.

05:22.906 --> 05:25.000
We should evacuate
the entire building.

05:25.075 --> 05:29.376
Sergeant, have you, um,
read the Emergency Protocols?

05:29.871 --> 05:32.420
- No, sir.
- Then don't question me.

05:32.874 --> 05:36.253
Seal off Number Ten,
secure the ground ﬂoor,

05:36.837 --> 05:41.764
and if the Doctor
makes it downstairs, shoot on sight!

05:45.887 --> 05:47.855
Well, you heard him! Move out!

05:53.478 --> 05:55.355
Let the sport begin.

05:56.898 --> 05:59.651
I'm getting poisoned
by the gas exchange.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.658
I need to be naked.

06:02.737 --> 06:03.909
Rejoice in it.

06:04.489 --> 06:07.743
Your body is magnificent.

06:27.012 --> 06:29.731
Ooh, such fun.

06:30.390 --> 06:37.148
Little human children,
where are you?

06:37.939 --> 06:42.410
Sweet little human kins,
come to me.

06:42.485 --> 06:44.658
Let me kiss you better.

06:44.738 --> 06:48.368
Kiss you with
my big green lips.

06:56.333 --> 06:58.301
Go and check it out!

07:02.005 --> 07:05.760
It does
us good to hunt, it purifies the blood.

07:07.677 --> 07:09.270
We'll keep
this ﬂoor quarantined

07:09.346 --> 07:12.691
as our last hiding ground
before the final phase.

07:16.686 --> 07:18.279
My brothers.

07:18.355 --> 07:19.652
Happy hunting?

07:19.981 --> 07:21.779
It's wonderful.

07:21.858 --> 07:26.705
The more you prolong it,
the more they stink.

07:26.821 --> 07:29.324
Sweat and fear!

07:30.367 --> 07:32.961
I can smell an old girl.

07:33.036 --> 07:36.836
Stale perfume
and brittle bones.

07:37.165 --> 07:42.046
And a ripe youngster,
all hormones and adrenalin.

07:43.046 --> 07:45.765
Fresh enough to bend
before she snaps.

07:45.840 --> 07:48.138
No!

07:48.218 --> 07:50.971
Take me first, take me!

07:55.392 --> 07:56.439
Out! With me!

08:01.606 --> 08:02.607
Who the hell are you?

08:02.732 --> 08:04.279
Harriet Jones,
MP for Flydale North.

08:04.359 --> 08:06.327
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

08:11.116 --> 08:12.288
We need to get to
the Cabinet Rooms.

08:12.367 --> 08:13.914
The Emergency Protocols
are in there.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.541
They give instructions
for aliens.

08:15.620 --> 08:16.746
Harriet Jones, I like you.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.207
I think I like you, too.

08:47.277 --> 08:48.995
One more move
and my sonic device will triplicate

08:49.112 --> 08:50.705
the flammability
of this alcohol.

08:50.780 --> 08:52.874
Woof, we all go up.
So back off.

08:55.952 --> 08:57.704
Right, then, question time.

08:58.121 --> 08:59.338
Who exactly are the Slitheen?

08:59.456 --> 09:01.675
- They're aliens.
- Yes, I got that, thanks.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.593
Who are you, if not human?

09:03.668 --> 09:05.136
- Who's not human?
- He's not human.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.088
- He's not human?
- Could I have a bit of hush?

09:07.172 --> 09:08.765
- Sorry.
- So, what's the plan?

09:08.840 --> 09:10.183
But he's got a Northern accent.

09:10.258 --> 09:11.475
Lots of planets have a north.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.677
I said hush!

09:13.803 --> 09:14.804
Come on!

09:14.929 --> 09:16.522
You've got a spaceship
hidden in the North Sea.

09:16.598 --> 09:17.679
It's transmitting a signal.

09:17.682 --> 09:20.731
You've murdered your way to the top of government.
What for? Invasion?

09:20.810 --> 09:23.780
Why would we invade
this godforsaken rock?

09:24.314 --> 09:26.442
Then something's brought
the Slitheen race here. What is it?

09:26.524 --> 09:28.492
The Slitheen race?

09:28.651 --> 09:30.494
Slitheen is not our species.

09:32.155 --> 09:34.203
Slitheen is our surname.

09:34.324 --> 09:39.000
Jocrassa Fel Fotch
Pasameer-Day Slitheen at your service.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.413
So you're family?

09:40.497 --> 09:41.840
A family business.

09:42.832 --> 09:44.129
Then you're out
to make a profit.

09:44.209 --> 09:46.007
How can you do that
on a godforsaken rock?

09:48.338 --> 09:50.807
Uh, excuse me.

09:50.882 --> 09:53.681
Your device will do what?
Triplicate the flammability?

09:53.760 --> 09:55.683
- Is that what I said?
- You're making it up.

09:56.179 --> 09:57.931
Oh, well. Nice try.

09:58.348 --> 10:00.388
Harriet, have a drink.
I think you're gonna need it.

10:00.642 --> 10:01.939
You pass it to the left first.

10:02.018 --> 10:03.895
- Sorry.
- Thanks.

10:03.978 --> 10:07.858
Now we can end this hunt
with a slaughter.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.073
Don't you think we should run?

10:11.528 --> 10:13.701
Fascinating history,
Downing Street.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.953
2,000 years ago,
this was marshland.

10:16.032 --> 10:19.411
1730, it was occupied
by a Mr Chicken. He was a nice man.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.581
1796, this was
the Cabinet Room.

10:22.664 --> 10:24.792
If the Cabinet's in session
and in danger,

10:24.874 --> 10:28.128
these are about the four most safest
walls in the whole of Great Britain.

10:28.211 --> 10:29.212
End of lesson.

10:34.509 --> 10:38.559
Installed in 1991. Three inches of
steel lining every single wall.

10:38.638 --> 10:39.981
They'll never get in.

10:40.306 --> 10:41.558
And how do we get out?

10:44.310 --> 10:45.687
Ah.

10:45.895 --> 10:47.488
He's safely contained.

10:47.564 --> 10:51.159
Now cut off communications inside
that room, then summon up the family!

10:51.234 --> 10:55.740
It's time we finished with
this insane planet for good!

11:18.553 --> 11:21.602
And there's still no word from
inside Downing Street,

11:21.681 --> 11:24.651
though we are getting
even more new arrivals.

11:27.270 --> 11:30.615
That's Group Captain
Tennant James of the RAF,

11:30.690 --> 11:33.569
though why he's been
summoned we've no idea.

11:34.235 --> 11:37.364
And that's Ewan McAllister,

11:37.447 --> 11:40.291
Deputy Secretary for
the Scottish Parliament.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.957
And this is most unusual.

11:43.036 --> 11:46.040
I'm told that is
Sylvia Dillane,

11:46.122 --> 11:49.626
chairman of the
North Sea Boating Club.

11:50.501 --> 11:54.005
Quite what connects
all these people, we have no idea.

11:56.382 --> 11:57.725
Group Captain.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.644
Delighted you could make it.
We're meeting upstairs.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.394
That's the spirit, off you go.

12:03.473 --> 12:07.148
Good to see you.
Come on through.

12:10.438 --> 12:13.942
Ah, Sergeant, now that
the Doctor's been neutralised,

12:14.025 --> 12:16.904
the upper levels
are out of bounds to everyone.

12:17.528 --> 12:18.620
Then who are they?

12:18.696 --> 12:20.573
Need to know, Sergeant,
need to know.

12:20.657 --> 12:22.830
I want you to liaise
with Communications.

12:22.951 --> 12:25.750
The Acting Prime Minister
will be making a public address.

12:26.329 --> 12:29.003
He will speak to
the nations of the world!

12:33.294 --> 12:37.219
There you are. If you'd just like
to go through and get changed.

12:40.009 --> 12:43.354
Now, if you'd like
to head down to the end of the corridor,

12:43.429 --> 12:44.601
it's first on the left.

12:44.681 --> 12:46.024
Thank you.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.819
- Got anything stronger?
- No chance.

12:53.898 --> 12:54.899
I've seen you
when you've had a few.

12:54.983 --> 12:56.280
This ain't time for a conga!

12:56.359 --> 12:57.952
We've got to tell someone!

12:58.027 --> 12:59.529
Who do we trust?

12:59.612 --> 13:03.708
For all we know, they've all got
big bog monsters inside of 'em.

13:04.242 --> 13:06.620
I mean, this is what he does,
jacks, that Doctor bloke.

13:06.703 --> 13:08.705
Everywhere he goes,
death and destruction.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.631
And he's got Rose
in the middle of it.

13:11.040 --> 13:14.135
Has he got a great big
green thing inside him, then?

13:14.210 --> 13:16.338
I wouldn't put it past him.

13:16.713 --> 13:18.431
But like it or not,
he's the only person

13:18.548 --> 13:19.948
who knows
how to fight these things.

13:20.550 --> 13:22.393
I thought I was gonna die.

13:30.560 --> 13:33.188
Come on, yeah?
If anyone's gonna cry, it's gonna be me.

13:33.271 --> 13:34.898
Now, you're safe
in my flat, jacks.

13:34.981 --> 13:36.107
No one's gonna
look for you here,

13:36.232 --> 13:38.200
especially since
you hate me so much.

13:38.568 --> 13:40.241
You saved my life!

13:41.362 --> 13:42.579
God, that's embarrassing!

13:43.614 --> 13:44.991
Telling me!

13:47.243 --> 13:48.916
He wanted me dead.

13:50.413 --> 13:52.757
And he's still out there,
Mickey.

13:53.750 --> 13:57.550
That policeman, that thing!

14:02.592 --> 14:04.594
Right, you head off.

14:04.677 --> 14:08.102
Inform Control I've one or two
things that still need doing.

14:09.265 --> 14:12.109
I haven't quite finished
with Mrs Tyler yet.

14:19.108 --> 14:20.109
Is that all of us?

14:20.193 --> 14:22.537
All the family
except Sip Fel Fotch.

14:22.612 --> 14:24.239
He's found a hunt of his own.

14:24.322 --> 14:26.120
Ah.

14:30.286 --> 14:31.913
What was his name?

14:31.996 --> 14:33.794
- Who?
- This one.

14:33.873 --> 14:37.127
The, uh, secretary,
or whatever he was called.

14:37.460 --> 14:40.134
I don't know. I talked to him.

14:40.630 --> 14:42.883
I brought him a cup of coffee.

14:43.299 --> 14:44.551
I never asked his name.

14:47.970 --> 14:49.142
Sorry.

14:52.350 --> 14:54.603
Right, what have we got?
Any terminals, anything?

14:54.685 --> 14:56.779
Nope, this place is antique.

14:56.854 --> 14:58.697
What I don't get is,
when they killed the Prime Minister,

14:58.815 --> 15:00.738
why didn't they use him
as a disguise?

15:00.817 --> 15:02.569
He's too slim.
They're big old beasts.

15:02.652 --> 15:04.905
They need to fit
inside big humans.

15:04.987 --> 15:07.035
But the Slitheen
are about eight feet.

15:07.115 --> 15:08.332
How do they squeeze inside?

15:08.449 --> 15:10.952
That's the device
around their necks, compression field,

15:11.035 --> 15:12.753
literally shrinks them
down a bit.

15:12.829 --> 15:15.548
That's why
there's all that gas. It's a big exchange.

15:15.623 --> 15:18.422
Wish I had a compression field,
I could fit a size smaller.

15:18.501 --> 15:21.300
Excuse me, people are dead!
This is not the time for making jokes.

15:21.379 --> 15:25.009
Sorry. You get used to this
stuff when you're friends with him.

15:25.591 --> 15:27.514
Well, that's
a strange friendship.

15:27.635 --> 15:30.605
Harriet Jones.
I've heard that name before. Harriet Jones.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.241
You're not famous
for anything, are you?

15:32.265 --> 15:33.687
Oh! Hardly!

15:34.559 --> 15:35.936
Rings a bell. Harriet Jones...

15:36.018 --> 15:37.440
Lifelong backbencher,
I'm afraid,

15:37.520 --> 15:38.897
and a fat lot of use
I'm being now.

15:38.980 --> 15:40.732
The Protocols are redundant.

15:41.107 --> 15:43.530
They list the people who could help
and they're all dead downstairs.

15:43.609 --> 15:45.410
Hasn't it got, like,
defence codes and things?

15:45.486 --> 15:47.955
Couldn't we just
launch a nuclear bomb at them?

15:48.906 --> 15:50.328
You're a very
violent young woman.

15:50.408 --> 15:51.910
I'm serious, we could!

15:51.993 --> 15:53.554
Well, there's nothing
like that in here.

15:54.370 --> 15:56.623
Nuclear strikes do need
a release code, yes,

15:56.706 --> 15:58.879
but it's kept secret
by the United Nations.

15:59.167 --> 16:00.510
Say that again.

16:00.585 --> 16:02.508
- What, about the codes?
- Anything, all of it.

16:02.587 --> 16:07.684
Um, well, the British Isles
can't gain access to atomic weapons

16:07.758 --> 16:09.886
without a special resolution
from the UN.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.169
Like that's ever stopped them!

16:11.220 --> 16:12.893
Exactly, given our past record.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.851
And I voted against that,
thank you very much.

16:15.933 --> 16:18.933
The codes have been taken out of the
government's hands and given to the UN.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.989
- Is it important?
- Everything's important.

16:22.064 --> 16:24.237
If we only knew
what the Slitheen wanted.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.570
Listen to me,
I'm saying Slitheen as if it's normal.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.325
What do they want, though?

16:28.404 --> 16:30.907
Well, they're just one family,
so it's not an invasion.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.913
They don't want Slitheen World.

16:32.992 --> 16:35.245
They're out to make money.
That means they want to use something,

16:35.328 --> 16:37.501
something here on Earth,
some kind of asset.

16:37.580 --> 16:42.177
Like what? Gold? Oil? Water?

16:42.627 --> 16:43.753
You're very good at this.

16:44.921 --> 16:45.922
Thank you.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.552
Harriet Jones,
why do I know that name?

16:47.632 --> 16:49.509
Oh, that's me.

16:49.592 --> 16:51.469
But we're sealed off.
How did you get a signal?

16:51.594 --> 16:53.187
He zapped it. Super phone.

16:53.971 --> 16:56.440
Then we can phone for help.
You must have contacts!

16:56.766 --> 16:58.393
Dead downstairs, yeah.

16:59.185 --> 17:00.311
It's Mickey.

17:00.394 --> 17:02.692
Oh, tell your stupid boyfriend
we're busy.

17:02.772 --> 17:05.194
Yeah, he's not so stupid
after all.

17:10.570 --> 17:14.576
No, no, not just alien,
but like, proper alien,

17:14.659 --> 17:16.787
all stinking and wet
and disgusting,

17:16.868 --> 17:19.041
and more to the point,
it wanted to kill us!

17:19.121 --> 17:20.714
I could have died!

17:20.790 --> 17:23.339
Is she all right though?
Don't put her on, just tell me.

17:23.416 --> 17:26.637
Is that Ricky? Don't talk.
Just shut up and go to your computer.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.055
It's Mickey, and why should I?

17:28.130 --> 17:33.057
Mickey the idiot, I might just choke before
I finish this sentence, but I need you.

17:36.305 --> 17:37.431
It says "password".

17:39.225 --> 17:41.227
- Say again.
- It'.s asking for the password.

17:41.310 --> 17:42.812
Buffalo. Two Fs, one L.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.819
So what's that website?

17:47.608 --> 17:50.452
All the secret information
known to mankind.

17:50.528 --> 17:52.405
See, they've known
about aliens for years.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.327
They just kept us in the dark.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.000
Mickey, you were born
in the dark.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.419
- Oh, leave him alone.
- Thank you.

17:58.494 --> 18:00.838
- Password again.
- Just repeat it, every time.

18:04.750 --> 18:07.469
Big Ben. Why did the Slitheen
go and hit Big Ben?

18:07.545 --> 18:09.843
You said to gather
the experts, to kill them.

18:10.006 --> 18:11.474
That lot would have gathered
for a weather balloon.

18:11.549 --> 18:13.750
You don't need
to crash-land it in the middle of London.

18:13.843 --> 18:16.892
The Slitheen are hiding, but then they
put the entire planet on red alert.

18:17.013 --> 18:18.310
What did they do that for?

18:18.389 --> 18:19.515
Oh, listen to her!

18:19.640 --> 18:21.517
Oi! At least I'm trying.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.603
Well, I've got a question,
if you don't mind.

18:23.686 --> 18:25.654
Since that man
walked into our lives,

18:25.730 --> 18:27.983
I've been attacked
in the streets,

18:28.065 --> 18:31.444
I've had creatures from the pits
of hell in my own living room,

18:31.527 --> 18:33.950
and my daughter disappear
off the face of the Earth.

18:34.030 --> 18:35.498
I told you what happened.

18:35.573 --> 18:37.166
I'm talking to him!

18:37.241 --> 18:39.414
'Cause I've seen
this life of yours, Doctor,

18:39.535 --> 18:40.878
and maybe you get off on it,

18:40.953 --> 18:42.754
and maybe you think
it's all clever and smart,

18:42.788 --> 18:46.418
but you tell me,
just answer me this,

18:47.043 --> 18:48.795
is my daughter safe?

18:49.795 --> 18:51.263
I'm fine.

18:51.589 --> 18:53.011
Is she safe?

18:54.258 --> 18:57.728
Will she always be safe,
can you promise me that?

19:03.559 --> 19:05.027
Well, what's the answer?

19:10.274 --> 19:11.321
We're in.

19:12.109 --> 19:13.611
Now, then.
On the left, at the top,

19:13.694 --> 19:17.244
there's a tab, an icon,
little concentric circles, click on that.

19:20.660 --> 19:21.661
What is it?

19:21.744 --> 19:23.212
The Slitheen have got
a spaceship in the North Sea

19:23.287 --> 19:24.334
and it's transmitting
that signal.

19:24.413 --> 19:26.133
Now, hush, let me work out
what it's saying.

19:26.248 --> 19:27.841
He'll have to answer me
one day.

19:27.917 --> 19:29.590
- Hush!
- It's some sort of message.

19:29.669 --> 19:30.670
- What's it say?
- Don't know,

19:30.753 --> 19:32.346
it's on a loop,
keeps repeating.

19:32.421 --> 19:33.593
Hush!

19:34.090 --> 19:36.843
That's not me.
Go and see who that is.

19:36.926 --> 19:38.428
It's 3:00 in the morning.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.013
Well, go and tell them that.

19:42.431 --> 19:45.275
It's beaming out into space.
Who's it for?

19:47.395 --> 19:49.614
All right!

19:51.440 --> 19:52.783
Mrs Tyler.

19:54.068 --> 19:55.160
Ooh!

19:56.028 --> 19:59.407
It's him, it's the thing!
It's the Slickeen!

19:59.490 --> 20:00.582
They've found us!

20:00.658 --> 20:01.830
Mickey, I need that signal.

20:01.909 --> 20:05.504
Never mind the signal.
Get out! Mum, just get out! Get out!

20:05.621 --> 20:07.919
We can't,
it's by the front door.

20:19.468 --> 20:23.689
Oh, my God.
It's unmasking. It's gonna kill us.

20:23.806 --> 20:25.683
There's got to be some way
of stopping them!

20:26.225 --> 20:28.853
You're supposed
to be the expert. Think of something!

20:28.936 --> 20:30.313
I'm trying!

20:31.689 --> 20:34.442
I'll take it on, Jackie.
You just run.

20:35.109 --> 20:37.157
Don't look back. just run.

20:39.113 --> 20:40.490
That's my mother.

20:42.450 --> 20:43.827
Right. If we're gonna
find their weakness,

20:43.909 --> 20:45.989
we need to find out
where they're from, which planet.

20:45.995 --> 20:47.338
So, judging by
their basic shape,

20:47.413 --> 20:50.041
that narrows it down to 5,000
planets within travelling distance.

20:50.124 --> 20:51.884
What else do we know
about them? Information!

20:51.917 --> 20:53.715
- They're green.
- Yep, narrows it down.

20:53.794 --> 20:55.091
- Good sense of smell.
- Narrows it down.

20:55.171 --> 20:56.593
- They can smell adrenalin.
- Narrows it down.

20:56.672 --> 20:58.424
- The pig technology.
- Narrows it down.

20:58.507 --> 21:01.602
Spaceship in the Thames.
You said "slipstream engine."

21:01.677 --> 21:02.678
Narrows it down.

21:04.346 --> 21:05.472
It's getting in!

21:07.892 --> 21:09.644
- They hunt like it's a ritual.
- Narrows it down.

21:09.727 --> 21:11.104
Wait a minute. Did you notice,

21:11.187 --> 21:12.905
when they fart,
if you'll pardon the word,

21:12.980 --> 21:14.823
it doesn't just
smell like a fart,

21:14.899 --> 21:16.867
if you'll pardon the word.
It's something else.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.364
What is it?
It's more like, um...

21:18.861 --> 21:20.204
- Bad breath.
- That's it!

21:20.279 --> 21:23.123
Calcium decay!
Now, that narrows it down.

21:23.199 --> 21:24.199
We're getting there, Mum!

21:24.241 --> 21:26.414
Too late!

21:27.787 --> 21:30.290
Calcium phosphate.
Organic calcium. Living calcium.

21:30.372 --> 21:32.875
Creatures made out
of living calcium. What else? What else?

21:32.958 --> 21:34.380
Hyphenated surname! Yes!

21:34.460 --> 21:35.821
That narrows it down
to one planet!

21:35.878 --> 21:38.347
Raxacoricofallapatorius!

21:38.422 --> 21:40.390
Oh, yeah, great,
we can write 'em a letter!

21:43.385 --> 21:45.183
Get into the kitchen!

21:51.435 --> 21:53.904
Oh, my God,
it's going to rip us apart!

21:53.979 --> 21:58.075
Calcium weakened by the compression
field. Acetic acid! Vinegar!

21:58.150 --> 21:59.652
- Just like Hannibal!
- Just like Hannibal.

21:59.735 --> 22:00.736
Mickey, have you
got any vinegar?

22:00.820 --> 22:02.743
- How should I know?
- It's your kitchen!

22:02.822 --> 22:03.869
Cupboard by the sink,
middle shelf!

22:03.948 --> 22:05.325
Oh, come on, give it here.
What do you need?

22:05.407 --> 22:06.829
Anything with vinegar.

22:09.453 --> 22:10.750
Gherkins!

22:12.289 --> 22:14.257
Yeah, pickled onions!

22:15.417 --> 22:16.919
Pickled eggs!

22:17.253 --> 22:18.425
You kiss this man?

22:46.156 --> 22:47.453
Hannibal?

22:47.658 --> 22:52.915
Hannibal crossed the Alps
by dissolving boulders with vinegar.

22:53.497 --> 22:54.669
Oh.

22:54.790 --> 22:55.882
Well, there you go, then.

22:58.460 --> 22:59.461
Whew!

23:06.302 --> 23:09.897
He's dead. Sip Fel Fotch
Pasameer-Day Slitheen is dead.

23:09.972 --> 23:11.315
I felt it.

23:12.141 --> 23:13.393
How could that happen?

23:13.475 --> 23:15.569
Somebody must've got lucky.

23:16.020 --> 23:21.151
That's the last piece of luck
anyone on this rock will ever have.

23:30.492 --> 23:31.835
Ladies and gentlemen...

23:33.329 --> 23:37.084
Nations of the world.
Humankind.

23:38.083 --> 23:42.805
The greatest experts in extraterrestrial
events came here tonight.

23:42.880 --> 23:46.350
They gathered
in the common cause.

23:47.301 --> 23:51.522
But the news
I bring you now is grave indeed.

23:52.848 --> 23:55.397
The experts are dead.

23:55.476 --> 24:00.027
Murdered,
night in front of me, by alien hands.

24:00.689 --> 24:03.033
Peoples of the Earth,
heed my words.

24:03.108 --> 24:07.363
These "visitors"
do not come in peace.

24:07.446 --> 24:09.039
Listen to this!

24:09.365 --> 24:14.121
Our inspectors have searched
the sky above our heads.

24:14.578 --> 24:19.505
And they have found
massive weapons of destruction

24:20.250 --> 24:23.470
capable of being deployed
within 45 seconds.

24:23.545 --> 24:24.546
What?

24:25.589 --> 24:30.345
Our technicians can baffle
the alien probes,

24:31.261 --> 24:32.888
but not for long.

24:33.305 --> 24:39.233
We are facing extinction
unless we strike first!

24:41.271 --> 24:46.698
The United Kingdom stands directly
beneath the belly of the mothership.

24:47.569 --> 24:50.493
I beg of the United Nations.

24:50.572 --> 24:55.419
Pass an emergency resolution.
Give us the access codes.

24:56.078 --> 25:00.834
A nuclear strike at the heart of the beast
is our only chance of survival,

25:00.916 --> 25:04.216
because, from this moment on,

25:05.713 --> 25:09.809
it is my solemn duty
to inform you

25:11.844 --> 25:14.393
planet Earth is at war.

25:15.014 --> 25:17.054
He's just making it up.
There's no weapons up there.

25:17.099 --> 25:18.817
There's no threat.
He just invented it.

25:18.934 --> 25:20.686
- Do you think they'll believe him?
- Well, he did last time.

25:20.769 --> 25:22.612
That's why the Slitheen
went for spectacle.

25:22.688 --> 25:24.065
They want
the whole world panicking

25:24.148 --> 25:25.908
'cause you lot,
you get scared, you lash out.

25:25.941 --> 25:27.221
They release
the defence codes...

25:27.276 --> 25:28.949
And the Slitheen go nuclear.

25:29.194 --> 25:30.241
But Why?

25:32.239 --> 25:34.492
You get the codes,
release the missiles.

25:34.616 --> 25:36.539
But not into space,
'cause there's nothing there.

25:36.618 --> 25:39.963
You attack every other country on
Earth, they retaliate, fight back.

25:40.456 --> 25:42.879
World War Three.
Whole planet gets nuked.

25:42.958 --> 25:45.837
And we sit through it, safe in our
spaceship waiting in the Thames.

25:46.503 --> 25:50.929
Not crashed, just parked.
Barely two minutes away.

25:51.133 --> 25:54.558
But you'll destroy the planet.
This beautiful place. What for?

25:54.636 --> 25:55.637
Profit.

25:55.721 --> 25:57.962
That's what the signal is,
beaming into space. An advert.

25:58.140 --> 26:03.317
Sale of the century. We reduce the
Earth to molten slag, then sell it.

26:04.438 --> 26:06.657
Piece by piece.

26:07.232 --> 26:08.905
Radioactive chunks

26:08.984 --> 26:13.114
capable of powering every cut-price
starliner and budget cargo ship.

26:13.489 --> 26:17.039
There's a recession
out there, Doctor. People are buying cheap.

26:17.159 --> 26:19.582
This rock becomes raw fuel.

26:19.703 --> 26:21.455
At the cost
of five billion lives.

26:21.538 --> 26:23.381
Hmm! Bargain.

26:23.665 --> 26:27.090
I give you a choice.
Leave this planet, or I'll stop you.

26:30.756 --> 26:32.884
What? You?

26:34.051 --> 26:35.553
Trapped in your box?

26:37.429 --> 26:39.306
Yes. Me.

27:02.412 --> 27:05.962
Yesterday saw the start
of a brave new world.

27:06.834 --> 27:08.836
Today might see it end.

27:09.920 --> 27:11.467
The streets are deserted.

27:12.422 --> 27:15.426
Everyone's home, just waiting,

27:16.051 --> 27:19.180
as the future is decided
in New York.

27:23.559 --> 27:25.687
It's midnight here in New York.

27:25.769 --> 27:27.487
The United Nations
has gathered.

27:27.563 --> 27:29.861
England has provided them
with absolute proof

27:29.940 --> 27:33.490
that the massive weapons
of destruction do exist.

27:34.069 --> 27:37.243
The Security Council will be making a
resolution in a matter of minutes.

27:37.698 --> 27:40.201
Ana' once the codes
are released

27:40.576 --> 27:44.422
humanity's first
interplanetary war begins.

27:56.216 --> 27:57.308
Sergeant!

27:58.594 --> 28:01.473
We'll take the call in
the Prime Minister's office.

28:01.889 --> 28:03.732
Maintain your positions.

28:04.558 --> 28:05.935
And good luck.

28:15.903 --> 28:19.498
Look at that!
The telephone is actually red!

28:22.284 --> 28:23.376
Oh.

28:23.452 --> 28:25.750
How long till they phone?

28:25.829 --> 28:27.297
Counting down...

28:29.541 --> 28:30.633
All right, Doctor.

28:30.709 --> 28:33.713
I'm not saying I trust you,
but there must be something you can do.

28:34.171 --> 28:37.050
If we could ferment the port,
we could make acetic acid.

28:37.132 --> 28:38.475
Mickey, any luck?

28:38.634 --> 28:40.136
There '5 loads
of emergency numbers.

28:40.219 --> 28:41.562
- They're all on voicemail.

28:41.887 --> 28:43.389
Voicemail dooms us all.

28:43.472 --> 28:46.066
- If we could just get out of here.
- There's a way out.

28:46.183 --> 28:47.184
What?

28:48.310 --> 28:49.778
There's always been a way out.

28:49.853 --> 28:51.150
Then why don't we use it?

28:52.773 --> 28:55.242
Because I can't guarantee
your daughter will be safe.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.494
Don't you dare!
Whatever it is, don't you dare!

28:58.612 --> 29:01.115
That's the thing.
If I don't dare, everyone dies.

29:01.740 --> 29:02.832
Do it.

29:05.077 --> 29:07.330
You don't even know
what it is. You'd just let me?

29:08.497 --> 29:09.498
Yeah.

29:12.459 --> 29:16.134
Please, Doctor, please!
She's my daughter, she's just a kid.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.223
Do you think I don't know that?

29:18.298 --> 29:21.427
'Cause this is my life,
Jackie. It's not fun, it's not smart.

29:21.510 --> 29:24.514
It's standing up and making a
decision because nobody else will.

29:25.138 --> 29:26.560
Then what are you waiting for?

29:28.350 --> 29:30.523
I could save the world,
but lose you.

29:40.320 --> 29:42.573
Except it's not
your decision, Doctor.

29:43.991 --> 29:45.038
It's mine.

29:45.117 --> 29:46.710
And who the hell are you?

29:46.952 --> 29:49.296
Harriet Jones,
MP for Flydale North.

29:49.371 --> 29:51.840
The only elected
representative in this room,

29:51.915 --> 29:53.713
chosen by the people
for the people.

29:53.792 --> 29:56.341
And on behalf of the people,
I command you.

29:57.504 --> 29:58.505
Do it.

30:02.050 --> 30:06.647
Victory should be naked!

30:16.565 --> 30:17.987
How do we get out?

30:18.483 --> 30:20.235
We don't. We stay here.

30:24.323 --> 30:28.248
The Council is voting.
The result should be known any second now.

30:36.710 --> 30:39.008
Use the "buffalo" password,
it overrides everything.

30:40.422 --> 30:41.890
What are you doing?

30:42.924 --> 30:44.676
Hacking into the Royal Navy.

30:45.635 --> 30:46.636
We're in!

30:47.179 --> 30:49.853
Here it is, uh, HMS Taurean,
Trafalgar Class submarine,

30:49.931 --> 30:51.353
10 miles off the coast
of Plymouth.

30:51.600 --> 30:53.819
Right,
we need to select a missile.

30:53.935 --> 30:56.029
We can't go nuclear.
We don't have the defence codes.

30:56.104 --> 30:58.277
We don't need it.
All we need is an ordinary missile.

30:58.565 --> 30:59.942
What? the first category?

31:00.609 --> 31:03.032
Sub harpoon, UGM-84A.

31:03.111 --> 31:04.533
That's the one! Select!

31:05.947 --> 31:07.540
I could stop you.

31:10.619 --> 31:11.871
Do it, then.

31:11.953 --> 31:13.455
You ready for this?

31:16.416 --> 31:17.417
Yeah.

31:22.214 --> 31:25.514
Mickey the idiot,
the world is in your hands.

31:26.301 --> 31:27.427
Fire.

31:37.062 --> 31:38.860
Oh, my God.

31:51.159 --> 31:52.877
How solid are these?

31:52.953 --> 31:54.000
Not solid enough.

31:54.079 --> 31:56.332
Built for short-range attack.
Nothing this big.

31:57.082 --> 31:59.585
All right.
Now I'm making the decision.

31:59.668 --> 32:02.091
I'm not gonna die.
We're gonna ride this one out.

32:02.170 --> 32:03.810
It's like what
they say about earthquakes.

32:03.839 --> 32:06.012
You can survive them
by standing under a doorframe.

32:06.091 --> 32:08.844
Now, this cupboard's small,
so it's strong.

32:08.969 --> 32:10.312
Come and help me.
Come on!

32:16.643 --> 32:18.020
The vote is in.

32:19.020 --> 32:20.522
The Council says...

32:22.732 --> 32:23.779
Yes.

32:24.192 --> 32:26.536
They are releasing the codes.

32:27.946 --> 32:29.823
Ring, damn you!

32:29.906 --> 32:31.908
It's on radar!

32:32.033 --> 32:33.876
Counter defence 556.

32:33.952 --> 32:34.999
Stop them intercepting it!

32:35.078 --> 32:37.172
- I'm doing it now!
- Good boy.

32:40.375 --> 32:42.173
556 neutralised.

32:48.717 --> 32:50.719
What do you mean, "incoming"?

33:01.480 --> 33:04.700
Everybody out! Now! Now!

33:07.319 --> 33:09.117
What the hell is that for?

33:09.905 --> 33:11.248
Sir, there's a missile...

33:13.658 --> 33:14.830
Sorry!

33:30.592 --> 33:32.594
That's mine. You've got mine!

33:32.677 --> 33:34.554
Disguise me, disguise me!

33:35.639 --> 33:38.813
No, you're the blonde.
No, I've got the other one. Take it off!

33:41.853 --> 33:44.151
Everybody, run!

33:44.606 --> 33:47.075
Run!
Let's get out of here!

33:53.782 --> 33:54.874
Here we go.

33:54.950 --> 33:57.373
Well, nice knowing you both.

33:59.788 --> 34:00.835
Hannibal!

34:02.415 --> 34:03.507
Oh, bol...

34:38.827 --> 34:40.204
Made in Britain!

34:41.371 --> 34:42.964
Oh, my God. Are you all right?

34:43.039 --> 34:45.382
Harriet Jones,
MP, Flydale North.

34:45.458 --> 34:47.505
I want you to contact
the UN immediately.

34:47.627 --> 34:50.630
Tell the ambassadors
the crisis is over. They can step down.

34:51.547 --> 34:53.516
- Go on. Tell the news.
- Yes, ma'am.

34:53.632 --> 34:56.136
Someone's got a hell
of a job sorting this lot out.

34:57.304 --> 35:00.023
Oh, Lord! We haven't even got
a Prime Minister!

35:00.140 --> 35:03.735
- Maybe you should have a go.
- Me! I'm only a backbencher.

35:04.561 --> 35:05.938
I'd vote for ya.

35:06.021 --> 35:07.022
Now, don't be silly.

35:08.315 --> 35:10.409
Look, I'd better go
and see if I can help.

35:10.483 --> 35:12.110
Hang on!

35:15.071 --> 35:19.201
We're safe.
The Earth is safe!

35:22.245 --> 35:23.246
Sergeant!

35:23.330 --> 35:25.048
I thought I knew the name.

35:26.291 --> 35:27.793
Harriet Jones.

35:27.876 --> 35:29.549
Future Prime Minister.

35:29.628 --> 35:31.756
Elected for three
successive terms.

35:32.297 --> 35:34.345
The architect
of Britain's Golden Age.

35:34.424 --> 35:37.678
The crisis has passed!

35:37.761 --> 35:43.359
Ladies and gentlemen, I have something to
say to you all here today...

35:46.561 --> 35:49.565
Mankind stands tall,

35:49.648 --> 35:51.992
proud and undefeated!

35:53.276 --> 35:55.574
God bless the human race.

36:25.475 --> 36:28.775
Mankind stands tall...

36:29.229 --> 36:32.358
Harriet Jones.
Who does she think she is?

36:32.440 --> 36:36.240
Look at her, taking all the credit.
It should be you on there.

36:36.528 --> 36:38.530
My daughter saved the world!

36:38.613 --> 36:40.286
I think the Doctor
helped a bit.

36:40.740 --> 36:43.163
All right, then.
Him, too.

36:44.452 --> 36:45.954
You should
be given knighthoods.

36:46.246 --> 36:47.714
It's not the way
he does things.

36:47.789 --> 36:50.008
No fuss, he just moves on.

36:51.167 --> 36:53.261
He's not that bad,
if you gave him a chance.

36:53.545 --> 36:55.889
He's good in a crisis,
I'll give him that.

36:55.964 --> 36:59.810
Oh! Now, the world has changed. You're
saying nice things about him.

36:59.968 --> 37:01.220
I reckon I've got no choice.

37:01.302 --> 37:03.851
There's no getting rid of him
since you're infatuated.

37:04.180 --> 37:05.853
I'm not infatuated!

37:06.307 --> 37:07.729
What does he eat?

37:07.809 --> 37:08.856
How do you mean?

37:08.935 --> 37:13.315
I was gonna do shepherd's pie.
All of us, proper sit-down.

37:14.524 --> 37:17.277
'Cause...
I'm ready to listen.

37:17.736 --> 37:20.535
I want to learn
about you and him and that life you lead.

37:20.613 --> 37:22.661
I mean, I didn't know
he was an alien.

37:22.741 --> 37:26.336
For all I know, he eats grass
and safety pins, and things.

37:26.995 --> 37:28.588
He'll have shepherd's pie.

37:29.831 --> 37:31.174
You're gonna cook for him?

37:31.499 --> 37:32.625
What's wrong with that?

37:33.418 --> 37:35.136
He's finally met his match.

37:35.503 --> 37:38.177
- You're not too old for a slap, you know!

37:38.882 --> 37:40.805
You can go and visit
your gran tomorrow...

37:40.884 --> 37:42.682
and learn some French.

37:42.802 --> 37:46.022
I told her you were in France.
I said you were au-pairing.

37:49.934 --> 37:51.106
Hello?

37:51.186 --> 37:53.439
Right, I'll be
a couple of hours, then we can go.

37:53.521 --> 37:54.738
You've got a phone!

37:54.939 --> 37:57.779
You think I can travel through space and
time and I haven't got a phone?

37:57.942 --> 38:00.036
Huh! Like I said,
couple of hours.

38:00.695 --> 38:02.697
I've just got
to send out this dispersal.

38:02.781 --> 38:03.782
There you go.

38:03.865 --> 38:05.742
That's cancelling out
the Slitheen's advert

38:05.825 --> 38:07.577
in case any bargain hunters
turn up.

38:09.579 --> 38:10.831
Urn, my mother's cooking.

38:10.914 --> 38:12.587
Good. Put her on a slow heat
and let her simmer.

38:12.665 --> 38:14.838
She 3 cooking tea. For us.

38:15.210 --> 38:16.382
I don't do that.

38:16.461 --> 38:17.963
She wants to get to know you.

38:18.046 --> 38:19.514
Tough.
I've got better things to do.

38:19.589 --> 38:20.590
It's just tea.

38:21.424 --> 38:22.516
Not to me, it isn't.

38:22.592 --> 38:23.718
She's my mother.

38:23.843 --> 38:25.686
- Well, she's not mine.
- That's not fair!

38:25.929 --> 38:27.602
Well, you can stay there
if you want.

38:29.682 --> 38:32.902
But right now, there's this plasma storm
brewing in the Horsehead Nebula.

38:33.520 --> 38:35.943
Fires are burning,
70 million miles wide-

38:36.314 --> 38:38.908
I could fly the Tardis
right into the heart of it

38:39.025 --> 38:41.073
then ride the shock wave
all the way out.

38:41.236 --> 38:44.831
Hurtle right across the sky
and end up anywhere.

38:46.908 --> 38:48.205
Your choice.

39:01.506 --> 39:04.100
Rose, I was thinking...

39:05.593 --> 39:08.437
I've got that
bottle of Amaretto from New Year's Eve.

39:08.513 --> 39:09.514
Does he drink?

39:14.269 --> 39:16.112
I was wondering
whether he drinks or not.

39:16.229 --> 39:17.606
Yeah, he does.

39:23.611 --> 39:25.284
Don't go, sweetheart.

39:27.031 --> 39:28.499
Please don't go.

39:45.842 --> 39:46.889
Good lad.

39:46.968 --> 39:49.391
Graffiti that again
and I'll have ya. Now, beat it.

39:56.144 --> 39:57.521
I just went down the shop.

39:58.187 --> 40:01.532
And I was thinking,
you know, like, the whole world's changed.

40:01.858 --> 40:03.986
Aliens and spaceships
all in public.

40:06.321 --> 40:07.493
And here it is.

40:08.489 --> 40:10.708
How can they do that?
They saw it!

40:10.992 --> 40:13.711
You're just not ready. You're happy to
believe in something that's invisible,

40:13.828 --> 40:16.502
but if it's staring you
in the face, "Nope, can't see it!"

40:17.540 --> 40:20.214
There's a scientific
explanation for that. You're thick.

40:22.670 --> 40:24.672
- We're just idiots.
- Well, not all of you.

40:26.090 --> 40:27.137
Yeah?

40:27.842 --> 40:29.014
Present for you, Mickey.

40:29.093 --> 40:30.436
That's a virus. Put it online,

40:30.511 --> 40:32.388
and it'll destroy
every mention of me.

40:32.472 --> 40:33.724
I'll cease to exist.

40:34.390 --> 40:36.233
- What do you want to do that for?
- 'Cause you're right.

40:36.517 --> 40:39.236
I am dangerous.
I don't want anybody following me.

40:40.939 --> 40:43.033
How can you say that,
and then take her with you?

40:44.233 --> 40:46.611
You could look after her.
Come with us.

40:47.654 --> 40:48.746
I can't.

40:49.614 --> 40:51.116
This life of yours...

40:52.116 --> 40:54.210
It's just too much.
I couldn't do it.

40:56.120 --> 40:57.713
Don't tell her I said that.

40:58.039 --> 41:01.339
I'll get a proper job.
I'll work weekends, I'll pass my test.

41:01.417 --> 41:03.294
And if Jim comes round again,
I'll say no.

41:03.378 --> 41:05.801
- I really will.
- I'm not leaving 'cause of you.

41:05.880 --> 41:08.099
I'm travelling, that's all,
and then I'll come back.

41:08.174 --> 41:09.676
But it's not safe.

41:09.759 --> 41:13.889
Mum. If you saw it out there,
you'd never stay home.

41:16.849 --> 41:18.066
Got enough stuff?

41:18.393 --> 41:21.317
The first time I stepped in
there, it was spur-of-the-moment.

41:22.188 --> 41:25.192
Now I'm signing up.
You're stuck with me.

41:27.735 --> 41:29.737
Come with us.
There's plenty of room.

41:30.405 --> 41:33.033
No chance. He's a liability,
I'm not having him on board.

41:33.366 --> 41:34.743
We'd be dead without him.

41:35.034 --> 41:36.502
My decision is final.

41:38.663 --> 41:39.835
Sorry.

41:44.002 --> 41:45.049
Good luck, yea h?

41:45.128 --> 41:48.507
You still can't promise me.
What if she gets lost?

41:48.631 --> 41:50.679
What if something
happens to you, Doctor, and she's left

41:50.758 --> 41:53.887
all alone, standing on some
moon a million light years away?

41:54.095 --> 41:55.597
How long do I wait, then?

41:55.930 --> 41:59.434
Mum, you're forgetting.
It's a time machine.

41:59.517 --> 42:02.487
I could go travelling
around suns and planets

42:02.562 --> 42:04.442
and all the way
out to the edge of the universe,

42:04.522 --> 42:06.195
and by the time
we get back, yeah,

42:06.274 --> 42:09.574
10 seconds would have passed.
Just 10 seconds.

42:10.445 --> 42:12.072
So stop worrying.

42:12.488 --> 42:15.207
I'll see you
in 10 seconds' time, yeah?

42:59.827 --> 43:01.295
Ten seconds.

43:22.975 --> 43:25.649
- It's a great, big museum.
- An alien museum.

43:25.728 --> 43:26.775
Someone's got a hobby.

43:26.854 --> 43:29.482
The cage contains
my one living specimen.

43:29.774 --> 43:32.027
It must've fallen
through time. The only survivor.

43:32.110 --> 43:33.487
It's killing him.
Do something!

43:33.569 --> 43:36.288
I swear, no one
on this base is safe.

43:36.364 --> 43:37.616
You've got to keep it
in that cell.

43:37.698 --> 43:40.058
It can't get out.
That Zack's got a billion combinations....

43:41.119 --> 43:42.666
Civilians! Let 'em through!

43:42.912 --> 43:45.836
That thing downstairs
is gonna kill every last one of us!

43:45.957 --> 43:47.755
- Where's the nearest town?
- Salt Lake City.

43:47.834 --> 43:49.051
- Population?
- One million.

43:49.127 --> 43:50.128
All dead.

43:50.211 --> 43:51.463
If you want orders,
follow this one.

43:51.546 --> 43:52.889
Why don't you just die?

43:52.964 --> 43:54.887
We're nearly there!
Give us two seconds.

43:54.966 --> 43:57.094
I've come to help.
I'm The Doctor.

43:57.176 --> 43:58.644
Exterminate!

43:58.719 --> 44:00.687
- Impossible.
- Exterminate!
