00:08.341 --> 00:12.471
I wish I could see your sister's face
when she finds Courtney's frog in her bed.

00:12.545 --> 00:15.378
You and me both. This is gonna be good.

00:15.448 --> 00:19.282
If she doesn't scream soon,
I'm gonna have to give my frog a drink.

00:19.352 --> 00:21.252
Ferdinand gets dehydrated.

00:22.956 --> 00:25.015
It's Will and Hilary. Open up.

00:27.327 --> 00:29.921
No. We're all gonna die.

00:32.499 --> 00:34.296
We wanted to say good night.

00:34.367 --> 00:37.894
We're going to bed just as soon
as we finish this frog-leg soup.

00:38.905 --> 00:40.463
Frog-leg soup?

00:40.707 --> 00:44.006
- It's mm-mm good.
- I wish you could have some...

00:44.077 --> 00:47.308
but there wasn't enough frog
to make more than two bowls.

00:47.380 --> 00:51.043
- Can I have a bite?
- Sasha, they're eating Ferdinand.

00:51.518 --> 00:55.284
Ferdinand? This is a guy frog?

00:57.891 --> 01:00.359
Nighty-night. Don't let the snails bite.

01:00.927 --> 01:01.951
Snails?

01:02.128 --> 01:05.928
That's funny, I thought she said
she put snakes in your sleeping bags.

01:06.866 --> 01:08.663
Psych!

01:09.869 --> 01:13.305
- That means "just kidding."
- Nighty-night.

01:13.940 --> 01:15.134
Will?

01:15.308 --> 01:18.539
Will you tell us a scary story
before you go, please?

01:18.678 --> 01:21.806
Okay, but I hope everybody's ready
to be scared to death.

01:21.881 --> 01:23.143
Yes!

01:26.586 --> 01:28.884
Wait. Hold up. Scream for me one time.

01:31.524 --> 01:33.151
That's good.

01:34.894 --> 01:37.658
I got a scary story,
but I have to warn you...

01:38.431 --> 01:41.093
it's really, truly frightening.

01:42.735 --> 01:45.363
- Any of you have pacemakers on?
- No.

01:46.072 --> 01:50.099
See, what makes this story so scary
is that it's true.

01:50.443 --> 01:53.105
It happened to a guy named Will... bert.

01:54.013 --> 01:56.641
Wilbert Smith... sonian.

01:56.883 --> 01:59.613
See, Wilbert Smithsonian
grew up in Philly.

01:59.686 --> 02:01.916
He went to school in the 'hood, right?

02:01.988 --> 02:04.513
But this school he went to was so tough...

02:04.591 --> 02:08.584
I mean, it was graffiti everywhere,
even on the principal.

02:12.031 --> 02:14.192
But that's not the scary part.

02:16.069 --> 02:18.799
It all happened right here in Bel-Air...

02:19.272 --> 02:22.264
when Wilbert was transferred
to a private school.

02:22.675 --> 02:25.235
It was a living nightmare.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.074

02:41.728 --> 02:43.992
How long they trying to keep us here?

02:44.397 --> 02:46.058
Banker, what do you know?

02:46.132 --> 02:49.260
- It's who you know that counts.
- Carlton, how you doing?

02:50.403 --> 02:52.200
- Wallace.
- Chadster!

02:52.272 --> 02:55.139
- Bankster!
- I'd like you to meet my cousin...

02:55.275 --> 02:56.640
Willster!

02:58.778 --> 03:02.578
So, Studmaster General,
what's the word on co-ed tennis camp?

03:02.649 --> 03:06.710
<i>I really got a lot out of it, amigo.
Scored big on and off the court.</i>

03:07.453 --> 03:11.480
Way to play. I kid you not, Will,
women faint at this man's feet.

03:12.058 --> 03:13.753
Odor-Eaters work for me.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.495
Outrageous. This guy's seriously twisted.

03:17.063 --> 03:19.190
He gets in a good one now and then.

03:21.100 --> 03:24.365
Will, this is Simon Stanhope,
our student council president.

03:24.437 --> 03:26.701
It's my job here to give you the tour.

03:27.173 --> 03:30.404
I took the Universal Tour.
You know that earthquake ride?

03:32.779 --> 03:35.907
Look out! Here comes the subway car!

03:36.683 --> 03:40.414
Excuse my cousin. He just doesn't know.

03:41.321 --> 03:44.620
As I was saying, this is our founder...

03:44.891 --> 03:48.418
and those are the first students
of the Bel-Air Academy...

03:48.895 --> 03:52.331
and they all carved their names on this...

03:53.099 --> 03:54.532
the alumni desk.

03:54.601 --> 03:58.731
And these are the championship oars
that we retired in 1957.

03:59.038 --> 04:01.029
Y'all don't throw nothing away.

04:02.875 --> 04:06.208
I'm Edward Fellows III,
but call me Ned, okay?

04:06.779 --> 04:07.837
Okay.

04:08.481 --> 04:11.348
You've been assigned to my lit class,
so I read your records.

04:11.417 --> 04:14.318
I just wanted to say,
we're both coming from the same place.

04:14.387 --> 04:15.479
You're from Philly?

04:15.555 --> 04:18.023
Shaker Heights, Ohio.
But when I was doing research...

04:18.091 --> 04:21.720
on my main man Langston Hughes,
I lived in Harlem.

04:22.161 --> 04:24.925
And believe me,
those two weeks changed my life.

04:25.999 --> 04:29.400
"I bathed in the Euphrates
when dawns were young

04:29.469 --> 04:32.996
"I built my hut by the Congo
and it lulled me to sleep

04:33.439 --> 04:36.033
"My soul has grown deep like the waters"

04:36.676 --> 04:38.041
I can tell.

04:38.745 --> 04:42.181
Listen, I've got a mean collection
of jazz platters.

04:42.448 --> 04:46.407
Anytime you feel like grooving,
come over and get down with my bad self.

04:46.953 --> 04:49.444
Seriously, you have any problems,
any questions?

04:49.522 --> 04:50.955
Where are all the fly honeys at?

04:51.024 --> 04:53.015
- Fly honeys?
- Yeah, girls.

04:53.326 --> 04:56.557
Will, didn't anybody tell you
this is an all-boys school?

05:00.133 --> 05:02.761
Greetings Bel-Airdales.
We're the Alligaroos.

05:02.835 --> 05:06.669
And we'd like to take this opportunity
to tell you new students to...

06:30.757 --> 06:33.453
Then Wilbert saw their evil plan.

06:33.526 --> 06:35.687
They were trying to break him down.

06:35.928 --> 06:39.056
First, they told him it was
an all-boys school.

06:39.165 --> 06:43.033
Then they tortured him with
a half an hour of Broadway show tunes.

06:43.970 --> 06:45.870
But he wouldn't break.

06:45.938 --> 06:47.428
Then they went ballistic.

06:47.507 --> 06:51.068
They brought in the evil teacher, Dr. Bloat.

07:01.587 --> 07:06.047
Enter the Bloat. Five, four, three, two...

07:11.431 --> 07:13.422
I am Dr...

07:13.933 --> 07:17.960
B, period, Langford...

07:19.605 --> 07:21.129
Oates.

07:23.743 --> 07:25.370
And you are...

07:26.379 --> 07:30.509
Alan, Banks, Downer,
Fales, Hunt, Lieberbaum, Smith...

07:30.883 --> 07:32.145
William Smith.

07:33.619 --> 07:35.678
Stanhope, Sterling, Svenson...

07:35.755 --> 07:36.744
Yo!

07:36.823 --> 07:38.347
<i>- Mr. Svenson?
- Ja?</i>

07:40.860 --> 07:45.422
Mr. Smith, how good of you to join us.
Mr. Smith, look around.

07:45.498 --> 07:49.798
Do you see any difference between
yourself and the other young gentlemen?

07:52.505 --> 07:54.564
Is that like a trick question?

07:56.042 --> 07:58.135
The tie, Mr. Smith. The tie.

07:58.277 --> 08:02.213
Kindly consult that section
of the rule book pertaining to neckwear.

08:02.281 --> 08:05.250
You mean Section 3,
Paragraph 4, which states:

08:05.318 --> 08:07.115
"A tie must be worn with a Windsor knot."

08:07.186 --> 08:09.245
But it doesn't say where.

08:11.290 --> 08:12.882
Take a seat.

08:22.168 --> 08:26.798
Now may we turn our attention to history?
Thomas Paine once wrote...

08:28.407 --> 08:31.774
<i>- Mr. Smith?
- Weren't you the bad guy in Goldfinger?</i>

08:51.831 --> 08:53.458
- Smooth.
- Looking great.

08:53.533 --> 08:57.526
- Sharp. Look at that.
- It's a little something I put together.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.700
Smith, ho!

09:07.213 --> 09:10.740
- My man Lieberbaum.
- Right. First name Kellogg.

09:11.584 --> 09:13.245
Listen, Cornflake.

09:15.021 --> 09:17.751
"Ho" is definitely not a word
that you want to yell.

09:17.823 --> 09:20.348
I think the word you're looking for is "yo."

09:20.426 --> 09:21.518
"Yo"?

09:21.594 --> 09:24.825
Yeah. It'll be easy to remember.
It's like "oy" backwards.

09:25.998 --> 09:27.397
All right.

09:34.707 --> 09:36.140
Will. Yo.

09:38.177 --> 09:39.872
Will, may I have a word?

09:39.946 --> 09:42.676
You got something
you want to say to me, man?

09:43.683 --> 09:46.151
Can you be serious for just one moment?

09:48.754 --> 09:50.312
Will, this is your first day.

09:50.389 --> 09:53.790
And I think you're rubbing a lot of people
the wrong way.

09:54.126 --> 09:55.923
Carlton, here in Boys Town...

09:55.995 --> 09:58.156
I don't want to rub anybody any way.

09:59.966 --> 10:03.163
That's not funny. Nothing you say is funny.

10:03.369 --> 10:06.429
What, did you like pass out
in history class? I had them rolling.

10:06.505 --> 10:09.997
The people who count were
laughing at you, not with you.

10:10.376 --> 10:11.604
I mean it, Will.

10:11.677 --> 10:14.874
When you're snubbed,
don't say that I did not warn you.

10:14.981 --> 10:16.949
Hey, Will. How's it going?

10:19.485 --> 10:21.783
- There you are.
- Okay, here comes Chadney.

10:21.854 --> 10:23.719
Just lay low and watch how it's done.

10:23.789 --> 10:25.654
Are you free this weekend, Smithy?

10:25.725 --> 10:29.661
My parents are throwing a weekend bash
at our compound in Malibu.

10:29.795 --> 10:32.787
Badminton, the lobster boil,
you know, the usual.

10:33.366 --> 10:35.129
Yes, the usual.

10:36.535 --> 10:39.299
The Chadster's Malibu bashes
are legendary.

10:39.705 --> 10:42.003
Carlton, you should come, too.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.009
Bang-bang.

12:05.191 --> 12:06.681
My man Geoffrey.

12:09.428 --> 12:12.795
- Master William.
- You know what I could go for right now?

12:13.599 --> 12:17.262
- Some pâté.
- Then by all means, go.

12:17.336 --> 12:20.601
Might I recommend
the gourmet deli on Roxbury?

12:22.241 --> 12:25.972
When I said I could go for it,
I mean, like, I want it...

12:26.812 --> 12:28.473
like you go for it.

12:30.983 --> 12:35.579
Wilbert thought his first day
at Bel-Air Academy was a big success.

12:35.654 --> 12:38.885
When he told his aunt and uncle,
they were thrilled.

12:41.460 --> 12:43.360
This is cause for celebration.

12:43.829 --> 12:46.730
Geoffrey, Will did well at school.

12:46.999 --> 12:49.024
This calls for champagne.

12:50.369 --> 12:52.337
There's been a tragedy at the school.

12:52.404 --> 12:55.601
The alumni desk has been cruelly
and wantonly defaced.

12:55.674 --> 12:58.575
- What happened?
- Someone carved the word "fresh" in it.

12:58.644 --> 13:01.272
And they have a theory
about the person who did it.

13:01.347 --> 13:02.678
They do?

13:04.016 --> 13:07.747
They think it was a freshman
who got halfway through and lost his cool.

13:07.820 --> 13:11.847
He lost his cool? That's funny.
"Fresh" means cool, right, Will?

13:12.458 --> 13:15.427
I can't keep up
with this crazy teenage slang.

13:17.163 --> 13:19.723
But I thought they call you
the Fresh Prince.

13:20.966 --> 13:24.561
Day damn one, Vivian.

13:27.439 --> 13:28.701
Champagne.

13:30.142 --> 13:31.370
Cork it.

13:34.346 --> 13:37.941
All I can say to you, Will, is tsk squared.

13:43.255 --> 13:45.723
You thought you had
the school all figured out.

13:45.791 --> 13:47.520
No. You didn't need my advice.

13:47.593 --> 13:50.221
All right, Carlton,
what is your brilliant advice?

13:50.296 --> 13:51.456
I'll tell you.

13:51.530 --> 13:55.125
You've gotta march straight
into school tomorrow and confess.

14:01.106 --> 14:02.801
I'm serious, Will.

14:03.275 --> 14:05.675
There's such a thing as the honor code.

14:05.744 --> 14:08.212
There's such a thing as dog dumb, too.

14:09.648 --> 14:13.277
- You don't intend to tell them?
- Maybe on my deathbed.

14:14.153 --> 14:16.348
Then on your conscience be it.

14:18.290 --> 14:22.454
Before we begin the class,
I must speak about the atrocious defiling...

14:22.528 --> 14:24.462
of our sacred alumni desk.

14:24.997 --> 14:27.329
Fingerprint analysis has shown...

14:27.466 --> 14:32.403
it is the handiwork
of our resident hoodlum, William Smith.

14:38.644 --> 14:43.240
And may we turn our attention to another
important figure in American history.

14:43.482 --> 14:45.109
Dolley Madison...

14:46.318 --> 14:49.116
was one of our most influential
First Ladies...

14:49.188 --> 14:51.656
and not, as Mr. Smith contends...

14:51.724 --> 14:54.659
the manufacturer of Ring Dings.

14:57.096 --> 14:59.360
In the short time left, I'd like to address...

14:59.431 --> 15:02.867
the infamous act of vandalism
which occurred here yesterday.

15:03.535 --> 15:06.698
The desecration of our desk
is indeed sad...

15:07.072 --> 15:11.304
but even sadder is the fact that no one
has yet come forward with a confession.

15:11.377 --> 15:14.039
- So if any of you may know...
- He did it.

15:19.084 --> 15:20.813
Can you believe it?

15:21.120 --> 15:24.521
Wilbert was accused
by his evil cousin Carlton...

15:24.690 --> 15:26.590
I mean, Carlbert.

15:27.726 --> 15:30.126
I don't get what's scary about this story.

15:30.195 --> 15:33.255
There aren't any werewolves
or vampires or anything.

15:33.332 --> 15:35.857
But we're coming to the scary part.

15:36.168 --> 15:40.298
Poor Wilbert was brought to trial
before the scariest monsters of all:

15:40.873 --> 15:42.101
Preppies.

15:46.211 --> 15:50.580
As president of student council,
I declare this tribunal in session.

15:50.916 --> 15:53.316
Let's begin by hearing from Mr. Smith.

15:53.385 --> 15:56.115
Will, will you finally take my advice?

15:56.188 --> 15:58.418
Let me do the talking for you.

16:01.493 --> 16:05.827
Gentlemen, my cousin
has committed a vicious crime.

16:06.065 --> 16:07.828
He could not be guiltier.

16:08.167 --> 16:10.362
Yeah. That's what I would have said.

16:11.170 --> 16:15.504
The fact is, young Will
has not yet developed the social skills...

16:15.574 --> 16:19.635
to adapt to the rarefied atmosphere
of Bel-Air Academy...

16:19.812 --> 16:21.370
or parties in Malibu.

16:22.781 --> 16:26.376
I recommend we put him on probation,
ban him from all clubs...

16:26.452 --> 16:29.649
sports, special events, the Alligaroos.

16:30.255 --> 16:32.849
No, not the Alligaroos.

16:36.028 --> 16:38.258
Probation is not enough.

16:39.231 --> 16:43.668
If Smith isn't expelled,
it will be an invitation to anarchy.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.736
I have to say that I am appalled...

16:45.804 --> 16:49.001
at this tribunal's lack of sensitivity.

16:49.174 --> 16:50.607
Speak on, bro.

16:52.678 --> 16:55.943
We can't judge Will Smith
by our standards.

16:56.482 --> 16:58.814
He doesn't even speak our language.

17:00.085 --> 17:03.543
Where he grew up,
the word "bad" means "good."

17:05.824 --> 17:07.815
Doesn't that say it all?

17:08.560 --> 17:10.084
Fight the power.

17:15.666 --> 17:18.761
- Will, do you have anything to say?
- Yeah.

17:22.641 --> 17:25.007
I didn't think y'all was gonna get so mad...

17:25.077 --> 17:27.568
for me writing my name on an old desk.

17:27.646 --> 17:31.343
I'd never write my name on a new desk.
That's vandalism.

17:33.218 --> 17:36.779
But those guys, they carved their name
in a new desk.

17:37.623 --> 17:39.921
They got their picture on the wall.

17:39.992 --> 17:41.357
That's totally different.

17:41.427 --> 17:45.454
They carved their names so people would
remember them as part of the school.

17:45.564 --> 17:47.088
That's why I did it.

17:47.466 --> 17:50.299
That's ridiculous.
You're trying to ruin our school.

17:50.369 --> 17:52.633
- No, he isn't.
- Lieberbaum, you're out of order.

17:52.704 --> 17:55.537
But he's not ruining the school.
He's making it better.

17:55.607 --> 17:57.074
Word up, Cornflake.

18:00.946 --> 18:03.312
I don't mean to dis you guys...

18:04.683 --> 18:08.084
but if Will's expelled, I'm leaving, too...

18:08.454 --> 18:11.685
and I'm taking my dad's
checkbook with me.

18:12.324 --> 18:14.952
Free Will!

18:19.998 --> 18:21.590
I'm going to bed.

18:21.667 --> 18:25.467
I hope you realize how lucky you were
that you weren't kicked out of school.

18:25.537 --> 18:29.496
Lucky? I gotta work every day after school
to pay off the desk repair.

18:30.008 --> 18:32.203
Before I cry myself to sleep...

18:35.881 --> 18:38.372
may I leave you
with a few words of advice?

18:38.917 --> 18:42.580
If at some point tomorrow,
or during my lifetime for that matter...

18:42.955 --> 18:47.790
you come up with another brilliant idea
for something to do at school, stop.

18:48.227 --> 18:49.785
Do nothing.

18:50.596 --> 18:53.929
Just stand there doing nothing...

18:54.967 --> 18:56.628
saying nothing...

18:57.136 --> 19:00.196
arms at your side like a zombie.

19:03.075 --> 19:06.010
Breathing just enough
to keep the blood circulating.

19:09.014 --> 19:10.641
And no more.

19:13.085 --> 19:15.076
Could you do that for me?

19:16.522 --> 19:20.356
I'm sorry, Uncle Phil. I wasn't listening.
What did you say?

19:26.698 --> 19:29.724
Good night, Will.
Lock your door when you go to bed.

19:31.603 --> 19:34.629
Will, before I go to bed,
I just want to say...

19:34.706 --> 19:38.301
I was proud of you tonight,
old sport. Kudos.

19:38.744 --> 19:41.269
You took your punishment like a man.

19:41.346 --> 19:44.110
- That's all you got to say?
- Good night?

19:44.183 --> 19:47.118
- Carlton, you Five-Oed me, man.
- Excuse me?

19:47.186 --> 19:49.313
- You dimed me out.
- Pardon?

19:49.388 --> 19:51.583
You tattled on me, all right?

19:51.790 --> 19:54.452
I did it for your own good.
You weren't going to tell.

19:54.526 --> 19:57.495
How do you know?
You didn't give me a chance.

19:57.563 --> 20:01.055
You're not worried about my own good.
You're just worried about yourself.

20:01.133 --> 20:04.569
It may seem like that to you now,
but one day, you will...

20:04.636 --> 20:06.160
Carlton, shut up!

20:09.208 --> 20:10.903
I know what this is about.

20:10.976 --> 20:13.206
You thought you were
this big hotshot at school...

20:13.278 --> 20:16.941
and I was gonna be your little charity case,
but I took your juice.

20:17.749 --> 20:20.274
Let me explain something to you.

20:20.786 --> 20:24.745
In this society,
we have this silly little thing called order...

20:25.090 --> 20:27.558
and we have rules to preserve that order.

20:27.826 --> 20:31.284
If we let people break the rules,
there would be chaos.

20:31.530 --> 20:35.296
We have rules where I'm from, too.
And they say you don't rat on people.

20:35.367 --> 20:39.827
The more you cling to your old ways
and refuse to listen to reality...

20:39.905 --> 20:43.739
the harder it's going to be
for you to fit in with my friends.

20:44.243 --> 20:48.304
You just don't get it, do you, man?
I don't want your friends. All right?

20:48.480 --> 20:51.677
If I woke up one morning
and I had all of your friends...

20:51.750 --> 20:53.479
and I was an Alligaroo...

20:53.552 --> 20:56.453
and I wore those cute shirts
with the little horses on them...

20:56.521 --> 21:00.685
I'd jump off the Empire State Building
and hope to catch my eyelid on a nail.

21:03.362 --> 21:07.423
With quips like that, it's no wonder
you're the toast of the town.

21:10.569 --> 21:12.059
Good night, Will.

21:13.872 --> 21:15.305
Master William.

21:15.874 --> 21:20.311
I have been informed that due
to your new after-school employment...

21:20.779 --> 21:25.113
you will no longer be requiring
your customary 4:00 snack.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.847
Could this be true?

21:30.922 --> 21:35.416
Yeah, afraid so, G. I might not even
get home till dinner time, if that early.

21:37.062 --> 21:38.552
What a pity.

21:40.999 --> 21:42.728
Out of curiosity...

21:42.801 --> 21:45.827
just what is the nature
of your enforced labor?

21:46.505 --> 21:50.407
Kitchen duty. Fetching, cleaning,
carrying, that kind of stuff.

21:54.313 --> 21:55.541
Indeed.

21:56.481 --> 21:59.075
Oh, well. Chin up.

22:10.128 --> 22:11.755
Picture this if you will...

22:11.830 --> 22:15.664
my man Wilbert in a kitchen
with a hair net on his head.

22:16.068 --> 22:18.901
If that's not a scary thought,
I don't know what is.

22:21.440 --> 22:24.773
So look. You all gotta do me a favor.
Raise your right hand.

22:25.344 --> 22:29.804
I want your solemn promise that if any
of you ever meets Wilbert Smithsonian...

22:29.881 --> 22:32.577
you won't tell him
I told you this story, okay?

22:32.684 --> 22:36.279
- Swear?
- I swear, Wilbert Smithsonian.

22:38.123 --> 22:39.886
Will's cold busted.

22:40.305 --> 22:46.354
