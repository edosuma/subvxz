35:00.014 --> 35:04.519
I've never seen a conductor
in Jordans before.

40:57.371 --> 40:58.998
Let's play the Beethoven.

43:27.730 --> 43:29.189
How about Simon Says?

43:29.273 --> 43:31.942
What's that game we play?

47:44.736 --> 47:49.241
I just feel like crap so I think
my voice is breaking up.

47:51.285 --> 47:54.829
Last night I had horrible experiences.

47:56.081 --> 47:58.750
My bed filled with blood

47:58.833 --> 48:01.045
because one of my lumens got busted.

01:02:05.554 --> 01:02:07.140
They are timeless.

01:02:07.223 --> 01:02:09.058
I have no idea how much time.

01:02:09.934 --> 01:02:13.354
Could be 5 years. Could be 5 hours.

01:06:53.217 --> 01:06:54.593
I don't know what's happening.

01:06:55.469 --> 01:06:57.138
I'm just like

01:06:57.221 --> 01:06:58.597
being moved around.

01:07:10.068 --> 01:07:12.653
The performance, the job is not finished.

01:11:31.161 --> 01:11:33.205
Are you going to marry him now?

01:11:33.289 --> 01:11:34.457
I already did.

01:14:45.313 --> 01:14:47.983
I only have leather that absorbs.

01:15:46.917 --> 01:15:49.044
It won't cost you nothing, but

01:15:49.127 --> 01:15:51.254
I can use this on patent leather.

01:15:53.298 --> 01:15:54.842
I can do it.

01:18:20.612 --> 01:18:21.905
See you tonight?

01:18:23.156 --> 01:18:24.366
I'll see you tonight?

01:19:59.544 --> 01:20:00.587
I like it.

01:20:34.997 --> 01:20:36.999
Mr. Batiste, may we do a jump shot?

01:26:57.587 --> 01:27:00.757
This is my first time out in almost a year.
