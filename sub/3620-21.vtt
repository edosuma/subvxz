WEBVTT

00:09.618 --> 00:11.446
Paige: WAIT, YOU GUYS.
WAIT FOR ME.

00:11.620 --> 00:12.664
THIS THING'S HEAVY.

00:12.838 --> 00:13.883
Piper:
WE GOT TO KEEP MOVING.

00:14.057 --> 00:15.015
I THINK WE'RE
GOING IN CIRCLES

00:15.189 --> 00:16.407
'CAUSE THIS LOOKS
VERY FAMILIAR.

00:16.581 --> 00:18.235
IT ALL LOOKS
THE SAME TO ME, TOO.

00:18.409 --> 00:20.107
OF COURSE IT DOES.
IT'S THE UNDERWORLD.

00:20.281 --> 00:22.805
IT ALL LOOKS THE SAME.
HOW MANY LOOKS CAN
THEY COME UP WITH?

00:22.979 --> 00:25.416
NO WONDER THEY WANNA
TAKE OVER OUR WORLD.
THIS IS UGLY.

00:25.590 --> 00:27.505
THEY'VE ALREADY
TAKEN OVER OUR WORLD.

00:27.679 --> 00:29.551
THAT'S WHY WE'RE
STUCK DOWN HERE.
WE GOT TO DO SOMETHING.

00:29.725 --> 00:31.814
[GASPS] COME ON.

00:31.988 --> 00:33.598
I'M OPEN
TO SUGGESTIONS.

00:33.772 --> 00:36.166
MAYBE WE SHOULD TALK
TO THE LEPRECHAUNS AGAIN.

00:36.340 --> 00:38.255
NO. I'VE HAD IT
WITH THE LEPRECHAUNS.

00:38.429 --> 00:40.257
THEY'VE MADE THEIR
ALLEGIANCE PRETTY CLEAR.

00:40.431 --> 00:41.911
THEY WOULDN'T EVEN GIVE US
A CHANCE TO EXPLAIN.

00:42.085 --> 00:43.260
I DON'T THINK
IT WOULD HAVE MATTERED.

00:43.434 --> 00:44.870
BILLIE AND CHRISTY
HAVE EVERYBODY THINKING

00:45.045 --> 00:46.437
THAT WE'RE THE THREAT.

00:49.005 --> 00:51.442
WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.

00:58.884 --> 01:01.365
WHY HAVEN'T THE CHARMED
ONES ATTACKED YET?

01:01.539 --> 01:03.802
THEY WILL. I ASSURE YOU.

01:05.326 --> 01:06.414
WHEN?

01:06.588 --> 01:08.242
WHEN THEY'RE
AT THEIR MOST DESPERATE.

01:08.416 --> 01:10.157
WHEN THEY REALIZE
THEY HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE.

01:10.331 --> 01:11.462
AND BILLIE AND CHRISTY?

01:11.636 --> 01:13.160
THEY'VE TAKEN OVER
THE HALLIWELL MANOR.

01:13.334 --> 01:15.640
AND THEY'VE GOT THE ENTIRE
MAGICAL COMMUNITY BEHIND THEM.

01:15.814 --> 01:17.251
NOT TO MENTION US.

01:17.425 --> 01:19.209
BUT ARE THEY PREPARED
FOR THE ATTACK?

01:19.383 --> 01:20.906
THEY WILL BE.

03:21.331 --> 03:22.463
WHERE DID EVERYONE GO?

03:22.637 --> 03:24.813
OH, I SENT THEM HOME.

03:24.987 --> 03:26.989
I THOUGHT THEY'D BE
SAFER AWAY FROM US.

03:27.163 --> 03:29.818
BUT WE MIGHT NEED
THEIR HELP. THE SISTERS--

03:29.992 --> 03:31.515
ARE GONNA COME AFTER US.
I KNOW.

03:31.689 --> 03:33.822
BUT IT'S NOT THE MAGICAL
COMMUNITY'S FIGHT.
IT'S OURS.

03:33.996 --> 03:35.780
IT'S OUR DESTINY.

03:35.954 --> 03:37.304
HERE WE GO AGAIN.

03:37.478 --> 03:38.957
DON'T WORRY.
I KNOW IT'S THE RIGHT THING

03:39.131 --> 03:40.350
AND IT'S ALL
FOR THE GREATER GOOD.

03:40.524 --> 03:42.047
BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN
I HAVE TO LIKE IT.

03:42.222 --> 03:45.486
LOOK, BILLIE, I KNOW
THIS IS HARD FOR YOU. OK?

03:45.660 --> 03:48.358
BUT IT'LL ALL
BE OVER SOON. I PROMISE.

03:48.532 --> 03:50.708
DON'T BE SO SURE.
WE CAME AFTER THEM
WITH OUR BEST SHOT,

03:50.882 --> 03:51.927
AND THEY STILL GOT AWAY.

03:52.101 --> 03:53.668
YEAH, BUT BARELY.

03:53.842 --> 03:55.800
MAYBE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
TO GO UP AGAINST THEM.

03:55.974 --> 03:57.933
THEY AREN'T
THE MOST POWERFUL WITCHES
OF ALL TIME FOR NOTHING.

03:58.107 --> 03:59.804
BUT WE'RE
NO SLOUCHES EITHER.

03:59.978 --> 04:01.893
BESIDES, WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT WOULD'VE HAPPENED.

04:02.067 --> 04:05.070
THEY GOT AWAY
BEFORE OUR BEST SHOT HIT THEM.

04:06.855 --> 04:10.859
DUMAIN THINKS WE SHOULD USE
VANQUISHING POTIONS NEXT TIME.

04:11.033 --> 04:12.252
VANQUISHING POTIONS?

04:12.426 --> 04:14.297
YOU WROTE DOWN
THEIR MOST POWERFUL ONES.

04:14.471 --> 04:18.258
IF WE CATCH THEM OFF GUARD,
THEY WON'T STAND A CHANCE
AGAINST US.

04:22.349 --> 04:23.306
BILLIE.

04:24.525 --> 04:26.744
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING HERE?

04:26.918 --> 04:28.746
OH, IT'S A LONG STORY.

04:28.920 --> 04:30.226
OH. WHAT HAPPENED?

04:30.400 --> 04:32.968
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE STILL
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT.

04:33.142 --> 04:35.275
SO WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE?

04:35.449 --> 04:37.233
I'M LOOKING FOR PHOEBE.
I CAN'T FIND HER ANYWHERE.

04:37.407 --> 04:38.887
WHEN WAS THE LAST
TIME YOU SAW HER?

04:39.061 --> 04:40.410
LAST NIGHT
AT HER LOFT.

04:40.584 --> 04:43.674
SOMEONE PUT HER
UNDER A SPELL, AND, UH--

04:43.848 --> 04:45.981
OH, NEVER MIND.

04:46.155 --> 04:48.244
IF YOU SEE HER,
JUST LET HER KNOW
I'M LOOKING FOR HER, HUH?

04:48.418 --> 04:50.899
ABSOLUTELY.
AND YOU DO THE SAME.

04:51.073 --> 04:53.075
WE'RE LOOKING FOR HER, TOO.

05:02.040 --> 05:04.260
WAIT. HE SAID
SHE WAS UNDER A SPELL.

05:04.434 --> 05:05.914
SO?

05:06.088 --> 05:07.350
PHOEBE SAID
THE SAME THING.
THAT MAKES ME WONDER--

05:07.524 --> 05:09.004
SHE'LL SAY ANYTHING
TO SAVE HERSELF.

05:09.178 --> 05:10.788
SO WILL HE.

05:10.962 --> 05:13.443
COME ON.
WE HAVE A POTION TO MAKE.

05:15.532 --> 05:17.012
OK, DO IT.

05:20.232 --> 05:24.019
OK, WE CAN'T KEEP PLAYING
"SURVIVOR: UNDERWORLD"
MUCH LONGER.

05:24.193 --> 05:25.803
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

05:25.977 --> 05:28.023
HOW ABOUT
WE JUST ORB HOME?

05:28.197 --> 05:30.025
NO, IT'S TOO RISKY.
BILLIE AND CHRISTY
WILL BE WAITING FOR US,

05:30.199 --> 05:31.853
AND THEIR NEW FRIENDS.

05:32.027 --> 05:33.811
WELL, WE GOT TO DO
SOMETHING FAST

05:33.985 --> 05:35.770
BECAUSE WORD
IS GONNA GET AROUND
THAT WE'RE DOWN HERE.

05:35.944 --> 05:38.555
SHE'S RIGHT. WE CAN'T
FEND OFF DEMONS FOREVER.

05:38.729 --> 05:39.687
WE NEED A PLAN.

05:39.861 --> 05:40.992
MAYBE JUST GIVE UP.

05:41.166 --> 05:43.168
WHAT?

05:43.343 --> 05:45.997
IT'S JUST THAT EVERY TIME
WE GO OUT AND TRY
TO GET A LIFE--

05:46.171 --> 05:47.912
MEET PEOPLE, DO NEW THINGS--

05:48.086 --> 05:50.828
WE SEEM TO WIND UP BACK
IN THESE KIND
OF LAME POSITIONS.

05:51.002 --> 05:54.092
GIVING UP'S NOT SUCH
A BAD IDEA, IS IT?

05:54.266 --> 05:57.182
NO, I'M NOT GIVING UP.
NOT NOW.

05:57.357 --> 06:00.360
AND NOT AFTER I FINALLY
FOUND SOMEONE I COULD
SEE HAVING A FUTURE WITH.

06:02.013 --> 06:05.582
LOOK, IF WE WANT
OUR LIVES AND...

06:05.756 --> 06:07.715
LEO BACK,

06:07.889 --> 06:10.413
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGHT.

06:10.587 --> 06:12.372
FIGHT BILLIE
AND CHRISTY.

06:12.546 --> 06:14.025
EXACTLY.

06:14.199 --> 06:16.680
ARE YOU SURE YOU CAN DO IT?
I MEAN REALLY DO IT.

06:16.854 --> 06:18.247
CAN YOU KILL THEM?

06:18.421 --> 06:20.684
YEAH. THEY'RE NO DIFFERENT
THAN DEMONS NOW.

06:20.858 --> 06:23.034
NOT AFTER ALL OF THIS.

06:25.863 --> 06:27.517
LOOK OUT.

06:31.129 --> 06:33.697
ENERGY BALL.

06:37.005 --> 06:38.006
GO, GO, GO.

07:09.690 --> 07:12.780
EXCUSE ME.
CAN I HELP YOU?

07:12.954 --> 07:16.392
I'M SORRY. I WAS JUST
LOOKING FOR MISS HALLIWELL.

07:16.566 --> 07:17.393
AND YOU ARE?

07:17.567 --> 07:20.527
I'M, UH, AN ADMIRER OF HERS.

07:20.701 --> 07:22.920
FOR QUITE SOME TIME NOW.

07:23.094 --> 07:26.097
FINE. WELL, IF YOU'D LIKE
AN AUTOGRAPHED PICTURE,
JUST LEAVE YOUR NAME--

07:26.271 --> 07:28.273
I DON'T WANT A PICTURE.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.754
I'M ACTUALLY HERE
FOR PERSONAL REASONS.

07:30.928 --> 07:33.104
AND MAY I ASK
WHAT IT'S REGARDING?

07:33.278 --> 07:35.933
WELL, LIKE I SAID, IT'S...

07:36.107 --> 07:37.457
IT'S PERSONAL.

07:37.631 --> 07:40.808
I'M AFRAID I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO ASK YOU TO LEAVE.

07:43.767 --> 07:45.639
OF COURSE.

07:45.813 --> 07:47.728
FORGIVE ME.

07:50.513 --> 07:54.648
IT'S JUST THAT SHE'S NOT
BEEN BACK TO HER CONDO
FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS,

07:54.822 --> 07:56.127
NOR TO HER SISTER'S HOUSE,

07:56.301 --> 07:58.347
AND I CAN'T SEEM
TO FIND HER ANYWHERE.

07:58.521 --> 08:01.611
I'M JUST A LITTLE
CONCERNED, THAT'S ALL.

08:03.004 --> 08:03.961
AREN'T YOU?

08:15.973 --> 08:18.019
ARE YOU SURE
IT WAS THEM?

08:18.193 --> 08:20.064
THEY VANQUISHED OUR BEST.

08:20.238 --> 08:22.763
AND KADL HASN'T
BEEN HEARD FROM
SINCE HE FOLLOWED THEM.

08:22.937 --> 08:25.592
IF IT'S THE CHARMED ONES,
HE'S DEAD, TOO,
JUST LIKE THE REST.

08:25.766 --> 08:28.029
THEN WHY DO WE KEEP
SENDING DEMONS IN AFTER THEM?
IT'S SUICIDE.

08:28.203 --> 08:30.640
NO, NO, NO.
IT'S NECESSARY.

08:30.814 --> 08:32.686
I NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT
THEY'RE DOING DOWN THERE.

08:32.860 --> 08:35.732
IT'S SO UNCHARACTERISTIC
OF THEM.

08:35.906 --> 08:37.647
AFTER ALL,
THEY LOVE IT UP HERE.

08:37.821 --> 08:40.432
THEY HAVE EVERYTHING
THEY WANT--

08:40.607 --> 08:42.739
FRIENDS, FAMILY,

08:42.913 --> 08:44.349
A LITTLE ROMANCE.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.743
SO THEN WHAT ARE THEY
DOING IN THE UNDERWORLD?

08:46.917 --> 08:48.310
WHAT ARE THEY RUNNING FROM?

08:48.484 --> 08:49.659
MY OLD MENTORS.

08:49.833 --> 08:51.748
THE TRIAD?
WHO ELSE?

08:51.922 --> 08:54.664
THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES
POWERFUL ENOUGH TO TURN
THEIR WORLD UPSIDE DOWN.

08:54.838 --> 08:56.753
BUT I THOUGHT
THE TRIAD HAD BEEN VANQUISHED.

08:56.927 --> 08:58.407
WELL, THEY HAVE,

08:58.581 --> 09:00.801
BUT THEY ALWAYS RESURRECT
SOONER OR LATER.

09:00.975 --> 09:03.455
FIRST IN SPIRIT FORM,
THEN COMPLETELY.

09:03.630 --> 09:07.677
YOU SEE, IT'S
WHY OUR GENERATION
CAN NEVER TAKE POWER.

09:07.851 --> 09:10.288
THEY WON'T LET US
'CAUSE THEY JUST
KEEP COMING BACK.

09:10.462 --> 09:12.029
BUT IT'S OUR RIGHT.

09:12.203 --> 09:13.640
IT'S OUR TIME.

09:13.814 --> 09:16.556
PERHAPS. BUT THEY'RE
TOO POWERFUL.

09:16.730 --> 09:20.995
WE CAN'T YET ELIMINATE THEM,
AT LEAST NOT WITHOUT HELP.

09:22.126 --> 09:23.301
CHARMED HELP.

09:23.475 --> 09:25.608
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

09:25.782 --> 09:27.784
PHOEBE HASN'T BEEN
TO WORK IN DAYS.

09:27.958 --> 09:29.830
BUT IT'S SO MUCH MORE
THAN A JOB TO HER.

09:30.004 --> 09:32.093
SHE GETS TO HELP PEOPLE
WITH HER COLUMN.
SHE NEEDS THAT.

09:32.267 --> 09:34.312
SHE MISSES THAT.

09:34.486 --> 09:35.836
JUST LIKE PIPER
MISSES HER CHILDREN

09:36.010 --> 09:38.621
AND PAIGE MISSES
HER NEW HUSBAND.

09:38.795 --> 09:41.319
AND THEY'LL DO ANYTHING
TO GET IT ALL BACK.

09:41.493 --> 09:42.669
BELIEVE ME.

09:42.843 --> 09:46.411
EVEN IF IT MEANS...
WORKING WITH US.

09:53.244 --> 09:55.986
UNLESS YOU DRAW
A DOUBLE RED,

09:56.160 --> 10:00.208
YOU DON'T STAND
A CHANCE, MY MAN.

10:00.382 --> 10:03.124
GO AHEAD.
PICK THAT CARD.

10:12.699 --> 10:14.875
HEY, THAT'S CHEATING.

10:15.049 --> 10:17.747
IT WASN'T ME. IT'S CHRIS.

10:17.921 --> 10:20.620
NO WAY. HE DOESN'T
HAVE ANY POWERS YET.

10:20.794 --> 10:22.622
YES, HE DOES.

10:27.278 --> 10:29.759
WYATT, SHIELD. ORB.

10:36.331 --> 10:38.202
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU
AND WHAT DO YOU WANT?

10:38.376 --> 10:41.989
YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG IDEA.
I'M A FRIEND. I'M A CUPID.

10:42.163 --> 10:45.557
YEAH, RIGHT. GET OUT
OF HERE, OR I'LL SIC
MY GRANDSON ON YOU.

10:45.732 --> 10:48.299
I'M TELLING YOU,
I'M NOT THE BAD GUY.

10:48.473 --> 10:50.650
HEY, WYATT.
WHAT'S GOING ON, BUDDY?
YOU REMEMBER ME?

10:50.824 --> 10:53.653
HUH? AT PAIGE'S WEDDING
WITH AUNT PHOEBE?

10:53.827 --> 10:56.481
SAW YOU SNEAK
A LITTLE BIT OF CAKE
BEFORE THE CEREMONY WITH HENRY.

11:00.137 --> 11:03.532
OH, THERE WE GO.
ALL RIGHT.

11:03.706 --> 11:04.620
SEE?

11:04.794 --> 11:06.056
SORRY.

11:06.230 --> 11:08.537
WE'RE A LITTLE ON EDGE
AROUND HERE.

11:08.711 --> 11:10.757
YEAH, I SEE THAT.

11:10.931 --> 11:13.020
I KNOW A LITTLE SOMETHING
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

11:13.194 --> 11:14.586
IT'S ACTUALLY
WHY I CAME HERE.

11:14.761 --> 11:16.327
BUT I'M LOOKING
FOR PHOEBE EVERYWHERE.

11:16.501 --> 11:17.459
I CAN'T FIND HER.
I'M WORRIED.

11:17.633 --> 11:18.460
PHOEBE, HUH?

11:18.634 --> 11:19.679
YEAH.

11:19.853 --> 11:21.028
SHE AND HER SISTERS
ARE JUST FINE.

11:21.202 --> 11:22.986
THEY SENT ME A MESSAGE
NOT TOO LONG AGO.

11:23.160 --> 11:24.553
REALLY? WHERE ARE THEY?

11:24.727 --> 11:27.469
WELL, YOU DON'T GET
TO KNOW THAT.

11:27.643 --> 11:30.341
AND FRANKLY, I DON'T HAVE
ANY MORE TIME OR PATIENCE

11:30.515 --> 11:33.910
FOR CUPIDS OR FAIRIES
AND OTHERS LIKE YOU.

11:34.084 --> 11:35.956
ESPECIALLY AFTER THE WAY
YOU TREATED MY GIRLS.

11:36.130 --> 11:37.609
SO BUZZ OFF.

11:37.784 --> 11:39.916
I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND
WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM.

11:40.090 --> 11:41.918
BUT I'M DIFFERENT.
I SWEAR.

11:42.092 --> 11:43.485
I'M IN LOVE
WITH YOUR DAUGHTER.

11:43.659 --> 11:45.400
OH, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.

11:45.574 --> 11:47.010
AND I JUST WANNA HELP HER.

11:47.184 --> 11:48.969
IF YOU REALLY
WANNA HELP HER,
STAY AWAY FROM HER

11:49.143 --> 11:50.840
AND LET HER LIVE HER LIFE,
IF SHE SURVIVES
THIS ANYWAY.

11:51.014 --> 11:52.146
VICTOR, LISTEN TO ME--

11:52.320 --> 11:53.800
LISTEN. I MEAN IT.

11:53.974 --> 11:55.453
I'VE WATCHED ONE DAUGHTER
GO TO HELL AND BACK

11:55.627 --> 11:57.151
FALLING FOR
SOME MAGICAL BEING,

11:57.325 --> 11:58.935
AND I'M NOT ABOUT
TO GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN.

11:59.109 --> 12:00.937
AND I'M NOT ABOUT TO LET
PHOEBE GO THROUGH THAT.

12:01.111 --> 12:03.418
SHE DESERVES BETTER.
SHE'S BEEN THROUGH TOO MUCH.

12:03.592 --> 12:07.117
NOBODY WILL EVER LOVE YOUR
DAUGHTER MORE THAN ME. EVER.

12:07.291 --> 12:08.510
I PROMISE YOU THAT.

12:08.684 --> 12:09.859
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT LOVE?

12:10.033 --> 12:11.861
I'M A CUPID.

12:12.035 --> 12:14.037
THAT DOESN'T MEAN SQUAT
UNLESS YOU HAD
YOUR HEART BROKEN.

12:14.211 --> 12:16.910
HAVE YOU HAD
YOUR HEART BROKEN?

12:17.084 --> 12:18.346
NO.

12:18.520 --> 12:20.870
THEN YOU DON'T KNOW
ABOUT LOVE. BELIEVE ME.

12:24.439 --> 12:25.788
LISTEN. I, UH...

12:25.962 --> 12:27.790
I'M SORRY I'M SO CRANKY,

12:27.964 --> 12:30.053
BUT I'VE GOT
A LOT ON MY MIND.

12:30.227 --> 12:33.753
JUST...JUST DO US A FAVOR
AND LET US BE, OK?

12:33.927 --> 12:35.755
WE'VE GOT ENOUGH
TO WORRY ABOUT HERE.

12:35.929 --> 12:37.887
VICTOR, I AM IN LOVE
WITH YOUR DAUGHTER,

12:38.061 --> 12:40.020
AND THERE'S NOTHING
THAT YOU CAN SAY
THAT'S GONNA CHANGE THAT.

12:40.194 --> 12:43.545
SO PLEASE, WHEN
YOU HEAR FROM HER,
JUST CALL OUT MY NAME, OK?

12:43.719 --> 12:45.765
IT'S COOP.

12:45.939 --> 12:47.462
I'LL BE WAITING.

12:57.907 --> 12:59.517
HEY, YOU GUYS, KEEP IT DOWN.

12:59.691 --> 13:01.476
THEY COULD STILL BE
IN THE HOUSE.

13:01.650 --> 13:03.173
HERE'S HOPING.

13:03.347 --> 13:06.002
BUT WE DON'T WANNA HAVE
TO ATTACK BEFORE WE'RE READY.

13:06.176 --> 13:08.091
I WISH WE HADN'T TAKEN
THE BOOK OF SHADOWS
TO YOUR CONDO.

13:08.265 --> 13:09.310
WE COULD'VE USED IT.

13:09.484 --> 13:10.572
I DON'T THINK
WE'RE GONNA NEED IT.

13:10.746 --> 13:12.226
STILL, I DON'T WANNA
TAKE ANY CHANCES

13:12.400 --> 13:14.141
AFTER WHAT HAPPENED
LAST TIME.

13:14.315 --> 13:16.404
WELL, THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH.
THEY ARE HUMAN AFTER ALL.

13:16.578 --> 13:18.188
I'M NOT SO SURE.

13:20.190 --> 13:22.149
ALL RIGHT,
GET THE VIALS.

13:30.374 --> 13:32.159
ANYTHING?

13:32.333 --> 13:34.639
NO.

13:47.304 --> 13:48.784
I GUESS
THEY'RE NOT HERE.

13:48.958 --> 13:50.307
MAYBE THEY'RE
AT MAGIC SCHOOL.

13:50.481 --> 13:53.180
NO, WE'RE NOT.

13:53.354 --> 13:55.704
WAITING FOR US, I SEE.

13:55.878 --> 13:58.968
WE KNEW YOU'D HAVE TO
COME BACK HERE EVENTUALLY.

13:59.142 --> 14:00.970
YES, WELL, SEEING
HOW IT IS OUR HOUSE.

14:01.144 --> 14:04.321
OH, WOW.
I SEE WE HAVE POTIONS.

14:04.495 --> 14:05.627
YOU TAUGHT ME WELL.

14:05.801 --> 14:06.889
HMM.

14:08.108 --> 14:11.111
SO WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR?

14:11.285 --> 14:12.373
NOTHING.

14:12.547 --> 14:13.504
STOP IT. STOP.

14:15.071 --> 14:17.682
I TOLD YOU THIS WOULDN'T
MAKE THEM ATTACK FIRST.

14:22.557 --> 14:23.863
WHAT WAS THAT?

14:24.037 --> 14:26.256
BILLIE'S
PROJECTION POWER.

14:45.275 --> 14:46.450
YOU OK?

14:46.624 --> 14:48.365
PIPER, ARE YOU OK?

14:48.539 --> 14:49.671
PIPER! PIPER!

14:57.287 --> 14:58.854
OH, MY GOD. YOU'RE HURT.

14:59.028 --> 15:00.900
WHERE ARE THE OTHER VIALS?

15:01.074 --> 15:03.772
LET'S GET HER OUT OF HERE.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.079
DAMN IT.

15:06.253 --> 15:07.558
COME ON. WE'VE GOT
TO TAKE CARE OF THIS.

15:07.732 --> 15:08.559
NO. IT DOESN'T MATTER.

15:08.733 --> 15:10.605
IT MATTERS TO ME. LET'S GO.

15:15.697 --> 15:17.742
I'LL GO GET HER
SOME WATER.

15:26.490 --> 15:28.536
HOW DID YOU KNOW
THEY'D COME HERE?

15:28.710 --> 15:30.233
WHERE ELSE COULD THEY GO?

15:30.407 --> 15:32.235
IT'S TEMPTING JUST TO
KILL THEM NOW, ISN'T IT?

15:32.409 --> 15:34.890
OH, IT'S NEVER THAT EASY.

15:35.064 --> 15:37.458
HISTORY PROVES THAT.

15:37.632 --> 15:39.155
BESIDES...

15:41.418 --> 15:45.422
WE NEED THEM AS MUCH
AS THEY NEED US.

15:58.435 --> 15:59.915
PIPER, PAIGE, WAKE UP.

16:00.089 --> 16:00.916
WHAT?

16:01.090 --> 16:03.179
WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME.

16:03.353 --> 16:06.139
OH, OK, PIPER, BLAST.

16:06.313 --> 16:07.749
WAIT. IF YOU
VANQUISH ME NOW,

16:07.923 --> 16:09.838
WHO'LL HELP YOU
STOP THE TRIAD?

16:10.012 --> 16:12.319
WE ALREADY
STOPPED THE TRIAD.

16:12.493 --> 16:15.800
YES, BUT THEY CAME BACK.
OR DIDN'T YOU KNOW?

16:15.975 --> 16:18.281
THEY'RE EVIL INCARNATE.
AND SINCE EVIL NEVER
REALLY DIES,

16:18.455 --> 16:20.805
NEITHER DO THEY,
OR AT LEAST NOT FOR LONG.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.459
WHO ELSE COULD
INVERT MORALITY

16:22.633 --> 16:24.679
TO THE POINT
OF MAKING YOU OUT
TO BE AS BAD AS US?

16:24.853 --> 16:26.420
BILLIE AND CHRISTY?

16:26.594 --> 16:28.509
I DON'T THINK SO.

16:28.683 --> 16:30.815
WE ALWAYS KNEW
SOMEBODY ELSE WAS BEHIND THEM.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.165
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

16:32.339 --> 16:34.602
WE WANT TO HELP YOU.

16:34.776 --> 16:36.169
HOW? BY KNOCKING US OUT?

16:36.343 --> 16:38.649
WE COULD'VE KILLED YOU
IF WE WANTED TO.

16:38.823 --> 16:41.435
OR AT LEAST
WE COULD'VE TRIED.

16:41.609 --> 16:43.176
BUT WE DIDN'T.

16:43.350 --> 16:45.526
THE POINT IS,
IF YOU WANT YOUR LIVES BACK

16:45.700 --> 16:47.528
AND YOU WANT TO STOP
THE TRIAD AS MUCH AS WE DO,

16:47.702 --> 16:49.138
THEN YOU'LL LET US HELP.

16:49.312 --> 16:50.661
HELP WITH WHAT?

16:50.835 --> 16:53.838
I KNOW THE TRIAD.
I USED TO SERVE UNDER THEM.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.493
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY,
I KNOW WHAT THEY'RE THINKING.

16:56.667 --> 16:58.060
WHICH MEANS
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND OUT

16:58.234 --> 16:59.975
WHAT BILLIE AND CHRISTY'S
NEXT MOVE MIGHT BE.

17:00.149 --> 17:02.325
WHICH MIGHT HELP YOU
DEFEAT THEM NEXT TIME.

17:02.499 --> 17:04.806
WHY WOULD A DEMON
WANT OUR HELP

17:04.980 --> 17:06.677
KILLING ANOTHER DEMON?

17:06.851 --> 17:08.505
PERSONAL REASONS.

17:08.679 --> 17:11.291
LOOK, ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW
IS IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO

17:11.465 --> 17:13.554
WHAT MUST BE DONE
TO SAVE YOUR FUTURE,

17:13.728 --> 17:15.773
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO TRUST US.

17:17.688 --> 17:18.776
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

17:18.950 --> 17:21.431
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T LIKE IT.

17:37.273 --> 17:38.927
DID YOU SEE THAT?

17:39.101 --> 17:40.581
SEE WHAT, SWEETIE?

17:42.670 --> 17:44.324
NOTHING.

17:44.498 --> 17:45.586
UM...

17:46.717 --> 17:48.850
WE'LL TAKE WHATEVER
HELP WE CAN GET.

17:52.462 --> 17:53.985
HOW CAN YOU TRUST THEM?

17:54.160 --> 17:57.032
WE CAN'T. BUT WE'RE
OUT OF OPTIONS.

18:03.038 --> 18:05.345
HOW DO YOU KNOW
THE TRIAD ARE EVEN HERE?

18:05.519 --> 18:06.911
I DON'T.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.784
BUT THEIR WITCHES ARE,
SO I DOUBT THEY'RE FAR AWAY.

18:09.958 --> 18:11.916
BUT IF YOU'RE RIGHT
AND THEY FIND US HERE--

18:12.091 --> 18:14.223
THEY'LL BANISH US
TO THE WASTELAND.

18:14.397 --> 18:15.398
YES.

18:15.572 --> 18:16.834
OUR SACRIFICE
WON'T BE IN VAIN

18:17.008 --> 18:20.534
IF WE FIND A WAY
TO MAKE SURE THEY DIE, TOO.

18:20.708 --> 18:21.491
UNDERSTAND?

18:23.754 --> 18:27.410
IT'S TIME FOR
THE TRIAD'S REIGN TO END,

18:27.584 --> 18:30.587
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

18:30.761 --> 18:33.547
Billie: CHRISTY,
SIT STILL. YOU'RE BLEEDING.

18:33.721 --> 18:36.593
Christy: I DON'T CARE.
JUST PUT A BANDAGE ON IT.

18:36.767 --> 18:38.595
TOO BAD WE'RE TRYING
TO KILL PAIGE.

18:38.769 --> 18:40.815
OTHERWISE,
SHE COULD'VE HEALED YOU.

18:40.989 --> 18:42.556
ARE YOU DONE YET?

18:42.730 --> 18:45.167
NO. UM, THIS IS GONNA
STING A LITTLE BIT,

18:45.341 --> 18:47.430
SO HOLD ON, OK?

18:49.998 --> 18:51.434
DOES THAT HURT?

18:51.608 --> 18:53.001
NO.

18:53.175 --> 18:54.959
WELL, I STILL THINK
WE SHOULD GET THIS CHECKED.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.613
WHAT ARE WE
GONNA DO, BILLIE?

18:56.787 --> 18:58.789
ARE WE GONNA GO TO THE E.R.
AND TELL THEM WHAT HAPPENED?

18:58.963 --> 19:01.488
WE HAVE WORK TO DO, BILLIE.
WE HAVE TO FIND
A STRONGER POTION.

19:01.662 --> 19:04.447
WELL, THERE AREN'T ANY, OK?
THAT WAS THE STRONGEST ONE
THEY HAD.

19:04.621 --> 19:07.233
THEN WE'LL MAKE
A STRONGER ONE.

19:07.407 --> 19:10.584
LOOK, CHRISTY, MAYBE THIS
ISN'T A GOOD IDEA ANYMORE.

19:10.758 --> 19:12.020
BILLIE.

19:12.194 --> 19:14.022
I'M SERIOUS.
IT DOESN'T CHANGE

19:14.196 --> 19:15.763
HOW I FEEL ABOUT THEM
OR WHAT THEY'VE DONE.

19:15.937 --> 19:18.592
BUT I DON'T
WANNA LOSE YOU, TOO.
YOU'RE ALL I HAVE LEFT.

19:18.766 --> 19:20.768
OK, BILLIE.

19:20.942 --> 19:22.378
LISTEN TO ME.

19:22.552 --> 19:24.641
YOU'RE NOT
GONNA LOSE ME. OK?

19:24.815 --> 19:27.818
AND I'M NOT
GONNA LOSE YOU...

19:27.992 --> 19:30.212
AS LONG AS WE
STICK TOGETHER.

19:35.870 --> 19:37.088
WHAT HAPPENED?

19:37.263 --> 19:39.047
IT'S NOTHING.
I'M FINE. I'M FINE.

19:39.221 --> 19:40.788
NO, SHE'S NOT.
THE SISTERS ATTACKED US,

19:40.962 --> 19:42.790
BUT THEY USED THE SAME
POTIONS AS WE DID.

19:42.964 --> 19:44.835
BUT THEY GOT HURT
JUST AS BADLY AS WE DID.

19:45.009 --> 19:46.054
WE'LL GET 'EM
NEXT TIME.

19:46.228 --> 19:47.577
APPARENTLY NOT
WITHOUT MORE POWER.

19:47.751 --> 19:49.362
YOU SHOULD GO BACK
TO THE MANOR.

19:49.536 --> 19:51.146
WE DON'T WANT THEM
USING IT AS A POWER BASE.

19:51.320 --> 19:52.800
IN THE MEANTIME,

19:52.974 --> 19:55.846
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO
ABOUT GETTING YOU WHAT YOU NEED.

20:03.114 --> 20:04.507
WAIT HERE.

20:08.032 --> 20:10.034
YOU TOLD US THEY ALREADY
HAD WHAT THEY NEEDED.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.689
THAT'S THE SECOND TIME
YOU'VE OVERESTIMATED
BILLIE AND CHRISTY.

20:12.863 --> 20:14.996
OR UNDERESTIMATED
THE CHARMED ONES.

20:15.170 --> 20:18.391
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
IT WAS ALWAYS AN AMBITIOUS
PLAN TO BEGIN WITH.

20:18.565 --> 20:20.697
BUT IT WAS YOUR
AMBITIOUS PLAN, DUMAIN.

20:20.871 --> 20:22.221
WE HOLD YOU RESPONSIBLE.

20:22.395 --> 20:24.527
AND I ACCEPT
RESPONSIBILITY, MY LORD,

20:24.701 --> 20:27.400
AS WELL AS ALL DUE CREDIT
FOR GETTING US THIS FAR.

20:27.574 --> 20:29.228
AFTER ALL, FIGHTING
THE WITCHES TO A DRAW

20:29.402 --> 20:30.620
IS BETTER THAN
ANY DEMON HAS EVER--

20:30.794 --> 20:32.709
BUT THAT'S
NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

20:32.883 --> 20:35.408
WE NEED TO TAKE OVER
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

20:35.582 --> 20:37.192
THE CHARMED ONES
ARE WEARY, DEPLETED.

20:37.366 --> 20:39.716
THEY'LL NEVER
BE MORE VULNERABLE
THAN THEY ARE RIGHT NOW.

20:39.890 --> 20:41.762
AND IF WE DON'T DESTROY
THEM WHILE WE CAN,

20:41.936 --> 20:45.766
THEIR MAGICAL OFFSPRING
WILL CONTINUE TO GROW
IN NUMBERS AND POWER.

20:45.940 --> 20:48.464
AND THEN THERE'LL BE
TOO MANY TO STOP.

20:48.638 --> 20:50.858
WE NEED THE HOLLOW.

20:51.032 --> 20:52.120
AGREED.

20:52.294 --> 20:53.208
WAIT.

20:53.382 --> 20:55.732
WE CAN'T USE THE HOLLOW.

20:55.906 --> 20:57.734
THERE'S A REASON
WHY BOTH GOOD AND EVIL

20:57.908 --> 20:59.083
BANISHED IT
HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.737
IT'S UNCONTROLLABLE.

21:00.911 --> 21:03.653
NEVERTHELESS,
IT IS OUR ONLY CHOICE.

21:03.827 --> 21:06.830
NO, BUT IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.
IT CONSUMES POWER, SURE,

21:07.004 --> 21:09.180
BUT IT'LL DRIVE WHOEVER'S
TRYING TO CONTROL IT INSANE.

21:09.355 --> 21:10.878
LOOK WHAT IT DID
TO THE SOURCE.

21:11.052 --> 21:13.489
BILLIE AND CHRISTY WILL
NEED CHARMED-LIKE POWERS

21:13.663 --> 21:15.404
TO SUMMON IT.

21:15.578 --> 21:17.972
FORTUNATELY, DUMAIN
KNOWS EXACTLY WHERE
TO OBTAIN SUCH POWERS.

21:18.146 --> 21:19.278
DON'T YOU?

21:31.115 --> 21:32.334
OH.

21:32.508 --> 21:34.293
OK, THEY'RE BACK.

21:34.467 --> 21:35.772
AT THE MANOR.

21:35.946 --> 21:37.470
OK, WE'RE ALMOST READY.

21:37.644 --> 21:39.385
I'M JUST WORRIED
THAT BILLIE'S GONNA
BE ABLE TO MATCH

21:39.559 --> 21:41.125
WHATEVER POTION
WE COME UP WITH.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.127
WELL, IT'S THREE AGAINST TWO.
IT REALLY SHOULD BE ENOUGH.

21:43.302 --> 21:46.217
YEAH, WELL, NOT IF THE TRIAD
IS HELPING THEM, IT'S NOT.

21:46.392 --> 21:48.481
WHAT WE'RE MAKING
MIGHT NOT BE STRONG ENOUGH.

21:48.655 --> 21:50.700
I JUST HOPE OUR DEMON
FRIENDS COME THROUGH FOR US.

21:50.874 --> 21:54.617
AND ISN'T IT STRANGE
SAYING "DEMON FRIENDS"?

21:54.791 --> 21:55.792
WE CAN'T TRUST THEM.

21:55.966 --> 21:57.620
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO.

21:57.794 --> 22:01.450
SO HOW MUCH
OF THIS HAS TO DO
WITH WHAT YOU THINK YOU SAW?

22:01.624 --> 22:03.974
I DON'T THINK I SAW LEO.
I KNOW I DID.

22:05.149 --> 22:07.151
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT MEANS?

22:07.326 --> 22:10.067
I DON'T KNOW. BUT I CAN'T
IMAGINE IT'S A GOOD OMEN.

22:13.984 --> 22:14.985
WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME.

22:15.159 --> 22:16.509
CUTE.

22:16.683 --> 22:18.902
SO YOU WANT THE GOOD NEWS
OR THE BAD NEWS?

22:19.076 --> 22:20.817
JUST CUT TO THE CHASE.

22:20.991 --> 22:22.515
VERY WELL.

22:22.689 --> 22:25.518
THE TRIAD IS, IN FACT, ALIVE,
AT LEAST IN SPIRIT FORM.

22:25.692 --> 22:27.346
BUT I DON'T THINK
BILLIE AND CHRISTY KNOW.

22:27.520 --> 22:28.564
THEN HOW ARE THEY
HELPING THEM?

22:28.738 --> 22:30.740
THROUGH A DEMON
WHOM I DON'T KNOW.

22:30.914 --> 22:33.526
BUT THE BIG NEWS IS
WHAT THEY WANT BILLIE
AND CHRISTY TO GET TO KILL YOU.

22:33.700 --> 22:34.657
THE HOLLOW.

22:34.831 --> 22:36.355
THE HOLLOW?

22:36.529 --> 22:38.879
ACTUALLY, YOU SHOULD
TAKE IT AS A COMPLIMENT.

22:39.053 --> 22:40.663
THEY OBVIOUSLY
WANT YOU DEAD AT ALL COSTS.

22:40.837 --> 22:43.405
AND EVEN POTENTIALLY
ALL OF MANKIND'S.

22:43.579 --> 22:46.365
WELL, THAT'S REALLY GREAT
BECAUSE EVEN WE CAN'T
STOP THE HOLLOW.

22:46.539 --> 22:49.063
WHICH IS WHY WE NEED
TO GET IT BEFORE THEY DO.

22:49.237 --> 22:51.152
WAIT. WHAT?

22:51.326 --> 22:53.415
PIPER, DO YOU REMEMBER
THE LAST TIME SOMEBODY
UNLEASHED THE HOLLOW?

22:53.589 --> 22:56.200
YES, I DO.
THE SOURCE USED IT
TO STEAL OURPOWERS,

22:56.375 --> 22:58.202
WHICH I THINK
IS THE POINT.

22:58.377 --> 22:59.769
BUT THEN HE WENT NUTS,

22:59.943 --> 23:01.902
AND THEN IT WENT INTO COLE
AND HE WENT NUTS

23:02.076 --> 23:04.165
AND THEN HE TURNED EVIL,
AND WE HAD TO VANQUISH HIM.

23:04.339 --> 23:05.775
IS THAT RINGING
ANY BELLS HERE?

23:05.949 --> 23:08.517
YES, WHICH IS PRECISELY
WHY WE NEED TO GET IT FIRST.

23:11.477 --> 23:13.217
OH, FINALLY. PHOEBE--

23:17.178 --> 23:18.527
WHAT'S GOING ON?

23:18.701 --> 23:20.921
IN THERE.

25:56.250 --> 25:58.644
AND THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT

25:58.818 --> 26:01.777

26:03.997 --> 26:05.259

WITH GREAT POWER ITSELF.

26:07.914 --> 26:09.176

26:09.350 --> 26:10.873
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO SUMMON THE HOLLOW.

26:11.047 --> 26:12.701
THAT'S CRAZY. WE CAN'T--

26:12.875 --> 26:14.660
YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

26:14.834 --> 26:16.487
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO GUARANTEE SUCCESS.

26:16.662 --> 26:18.577
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO SAVE THE GREATER GOOD,

26:18.751 --> 26:21.188
AND IT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO SAVE WYATT AND CHRIS

26:21.362 --> 26:24.104
FROM FOLLOWING
IN THE WRONG FOOTSTEPS.

26:30.284 --> 26:33.940
I WANNA GET THEM
AS MUCH AS ANYBODY ELSE,
BUT AT WHAT COST?

26:34.114 --> 26:36.899
IF WE TAKE THIS IN,
HOW DO WE GET RID OF IT?

26:37.073 --> 26:39.249

A SPELL RIGHT HERE.

BE AROUND TO SAY IT?

26:43.950 --> 26:45.734
SHE'S GOT A POINT.

26:45.908 --> 26:48.345
WELL, WE CAN TAKE
BILLIE AND CHRISTY OUT

26:48.519 --> 26:50.043
BEFORE WE GET INFECTED,

26:50.217 --> 26:53.481
OR WE CAN DO NOTHING,
LET THEM GET THE HOLLOW,

26:53.655 --> 26:56.440
AND THEN ALL OF THIS
REALLY WON'T MATTER
BECAUSE THEN WE'LL BE DEAD.

26:56.615 --> 26:59.966
YOU DO REALIZE, OF COURSE,
THAT TAKING OUT
BILLIE AND CHRISTY

27:00.140 --> 27:02.621
WILL ONLY ELIMINATE
TODAY'S PROBLEMS.

THIS NIGHTMARE TO BE OVER.

KEEP FINDING NEW WAYS
TO ATTACK YOU

27:17.723 --> 27:19.202

YOU'LL HAVE THE POWER

ONCE AND FOR ALL.

GONNA COME AFTER US NEXT?
