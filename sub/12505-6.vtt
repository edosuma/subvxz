[Kaylie] Previously
on Make It or Break It:

00:07.341 --> 00:09.310
Your friend just
stole Emily's routine.

00:09.343 --> 00:11.479
- How could you do that?
- She stole my choreographer.

00:11.512 --> 00:14.448
- So I stole her choreography.
- I can't tell you I love you

00:14.482 --> 00:17.452
because you do stuff
like you just did to Emily.

00:17.484 --> 00:20.054
I was wondering if you'd
like to go out sometime.

00:20.088 --> 00:22.457
- On a date.
- Yes.

00:22.489 --> 00:24.459
Promise rings.
We promise to focus

00:24.491 --> 00:27.160
on nothing but gymnastics
and forsake

00:27.195 --> 00:28.362
the biggest distraction
of all: boys.

00:28.396 --> 00:31.199
Why do you like everybody to
think you're such a party boy?

00:31.231 --> 00:32.600
It's part of my image.

00:32.633 --> 00:35.469
Your game isn't working on me.

00:35.502 --> 00:37.105
Can't blame a guy
for trying.

[Chloe] I can't
believe we fell asleep!

01:10.270 --> 01:13.641
I can't believe
I'm letting you leave
without an encore of last night.

01:13.675 --> 01:15.576
Stop! What if Lauren
catches me sneaking
out of your house like...?

01:15.610 --> 01:19.113
- A common tramp?
- What are you
doing up this early?

01:19.147 --> 01:21.481
I had a bad dream and now
I've woken up to a nightmare.

01:21.516 --> 01:24.452
I should get home
to my kids.

01:24.484 --> 01:26.654
I'm sure they're used to you
cattin' around all night.

01:26.687 --> 01:29.423
That's enough.

01:29.457 --> 01:31.358
I'll talk to you later.

01:35.663 --> 01:39.667
So does this mean
I can sneak boys into
the house to have sex with?

01:39.700 --> 01:41.602
It certainly does not.
I'm an adult,

01:41.635 --> 01:44.672
and you better not
have sex with anyone
until you're at least 18.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.274
You have nothing
to worry about.

01:46.307 --> 01:48.475
I'm a virgin
and I plan on staying one.

01:48.508 --> 01:50.278
Well, I'm very
happy to hear that

01:50.311 --> 01:53.181
because girls who
win gold medals aren't
interested in boys.

01:53.214 --> 01:54.615
They're only
interested in winning.

- How about ya'll?
- Fine.

02:50.738 --> 02:55.343
- Good.
- You were out like a light
when I got home last night.

02:55.376 --> 02:56.543
You didn't even
notice me come in.

02:56.576 --> 02:58.980
I did, however,
hear you cursing

02:59.013 --> 03:01.615
when you climbed through your
bedroom window this morning.

03:01.649 --> 03:03.317
We don't care that you spend
the night at your boyfriend's.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.386
We also don't care
that you're having sex.

03:05.420 --> 03:07.555
- Wh...
- Just make sure
you're being safe.

03:07.588 --> 03:10.792
Whenever you start sleeping
with someone new make sure
both get tested for any STIs.

03:12.292 --> 03:14.227
All right. You... Come on!

03:14.262 --> 03:16.631
We're gonna be late!
Come on! Hurry! Oh...

03:16.663 --> 03:18.299
[laughing]

03:19.267 --> 03:20.234
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

03:20.268 --> 03:21.302
- How...
- How...

03:21.334 --> 03:22.536
- Go ahead.
- Oh...

03:22.570 --> 03:26.240
I was just gonna ask
how was your evening?

03:26.274 --> 03:28.242
Very nice. How was yours?

03:28.276 --> 03:29.609
Great.

03:29.644 --> 03:32.646
I mean,
it could have been greater,

03:32.679 --> 03:35.649
if I'd have
spent it with you.

03:35.682 --> 03:42.390
Um... So, to avoid
any more lost
opportunities for greatness,

03:42.423 --> 03:45.659
would you like to have
dinner with me tonight?

03:45.692 --> 03:48.296
I would love to have
dinner with you tonight.

03:49.464 --> 03:50.664
Great.

03:52.833 --> 03:55.269
- Oh, and I think it would
be best if we didn't...
- Tell anyone.

03:55.303 --> 03:56.603
- Just because...
- People talk.

03:56.636 --> 03:59.639
- And it's... Exactly.
- None of their business.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.609
I'll pick you up at six.

04:01.641 --> 04:03.444
Great.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.350
[rock music plays]

04:10.383 --> 04:12.586
OK, so we have a National
practice in a few days,

04:12.620 --> 04:15.522
and next week
the National Committee
is picking the team for World.

04:15.556 --> 04:19.427
So I think that we
should run up Bear Peak
every morning before practice.

04:19.459 --> 04:21.595
- I'm in.
- Uh, what time are we talking?

04:21.629 --> 04:24.397
- 5:30.
- Are you insane?

04:24.432 --> 04:25.566
Oh, Lauren, don't worry.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.601
I don't expect you
to have the discipline

04:27.635 --> 04:30.438
to drag yourself out
of Carter's bed at 5:30.

04:30.470 --> 04:33.040
I dragged myself out of
his bed this morning at 5:00.

04:33.074 --> 04:35.843
[Kaylie scoffs] Whatever.
Extra conditioning
is gonna give us an edge

04:35.876 --> 04:38.745
over the other
National Team girls.
And remember,

04:38.779 --> 04:41.581
only six of the 12
will make the World Team.

04:41.616 --> 04:45.453
Hey. Are we talkin' Worlds
already? That's months away.

04:45.486 --> 04:48.856
- What do you want?
- Just to invite you
lovely ladies to a party

04:48.889 --> 04:50.724
at my new lake house
this afternoon.

04:50.757 --> 04:53.327
It's right after practice
until the beer runs out

04:53.361 --> 04:57.798
- or the cops bust us up.
- This guy, he doesn't give up.

04:57.831 --> 05:01.568
Well, we regret to inform
you that even if we wanted

05:01.602 --> 05:03.603
to go to your frat party,
which we don't,

05:03.638 --> 05:05.639
we can't because we have
practice in the morning

05:05.673 --> 05:07.474
and we need to get
to bed early.

05:07.508 --> 05:11.578
Too bad. Some of my
co-Olympians would dig
meeting the Rock Rebels.

05:11.612 --> 05:14.615
- What Olympians?
- I don't want
to drop any names.

05:14.648 --> 05:17.385
- Drop away.
- Just Bode,

05:17.418 --> 05:19.554
probably Shaun,
maybe Evan.

05:19.586 --> 05:21.655
- Shaun White?
- Evan Lysacek?

05:21.689 --> 05:24.658
- Bode Miller? Yum.
- We're not going.

05:25.592 --> 05:27.594
Speak for yourself.

05:27.628 --> 05:30.498
- I'll be there.
- [Austin] Bring your suit.

05:30.530 --> 05:32.632
- Or not.
- [chuckles]

05:32.667 --> 05:36.137
- I got a Jacuzzi.
- Of course you do.

05:36.170 --> 05:37.438
Goodbye.

05:39.173 --> 05:41.875
You so want
to go to his party.

05:41.909 --> 05:45.680
- You know you do.
- I would love
to meet Shaun White.

05:45.712 --> 05:48.648
Hello? Remember the last
time we went to a party?

05:48.683 --> 05:50.650
Things got totally
out of control.

05:50.685 --> 05:54.721
As I recall, you
got totally out of control.

05:54.754 --> 05:59.826
- Who, "Keg-Stand Kaylie"?
- Oh, and let's not forget
who lost their virginity.

05:59.860 --> 06:03.564
- To my boyfriend.
- Shh! Sasha's coming.

06:03.598 --> 06:06.400
Good morning, ladies.
As you all know,

06:06.434 --> 06:08.669
the selection for the team going
to Worlds is three weeks away

06:08.702 --> 06:13.139
and the six girls who make that
team will of course pave their
way to the Olympic Team in 2012.

06:13.174 --> 06:16.710
So this next week is critical.
You will have to train harder
than ever before.

06:16.744 --> 06:19.413
Ten hours a day,
seven days a week.

06:19.447 --> 06:21.581
So I want you
to take tomorrow off.

06:21.616 --> 06:23.618
Rest your bodies,
have some fun, relax,

06:23.650 --> 06:26.586
because Monday,
boot camp begins.

06:27.622 --> 06:31.791
Gee, how could we relax,
have some fun?

06:31.826 --> 06:33.994
Kaylie, any ideas?

07:00.420 --> 07:04.458
[Kaylie] You know Sasha,
whenever he says "relax"
or "have fun,"

07:04.492 --> 07:06.593
what he really means is,
"this is a test

07:06.627 --> 07:10.196
and you better get your butts
in the gym and impress me."

07:10.231 --> 07:12.933
When has Sasha ever said
to relax and have fun?

07:12.967 --> 07:16.770
- It's true, this is a first.
- He seemed like he meant it.

07:16.804 --> 07:20.675
Look, whether Sasha
meant it or not, we could
all use the extra practice.

07:20.707 --> 07:22.709
Emily, you're not sticking
your vaults consistently.

07:22.743 --> 07:24.612
Lauren, you need
to raise your DOD on bars,

07:24.644 --> 07:27.615
and Payson...
Well, let's face it.

07:27.647 --> 07:30.850
You're struggling
with level seven
and eight skills.

07:30.885 --> 07:34.622
Gee, thanks.

07:34.655 --> 07:37.224
Look, I'm sorry.
But as the team captain,

07:37.258 --> 07:39.660
it's my job to make sure
everybody's on top
of their game.

07:39.694 --> 07:42.730
Oh, I thought
that was Sasha's job

07:42.762 --> 07:47.268
and he seems to think our
"game" is good enough
to warrant a day off.

07:47.301 --> 07:50.705
I could care less what you do.
Emily? Payson?

07:50.738 --> 07:54.007
Yeah. I'm always
up for more practice.

07:54.041 --> 07:56.510
Sure.

07:56.544 --> 07:59.680
And that's why we have
promise rings, and you don't.

07:59.714 --> 08:03.650
And that's why I have a
boyfriend and you don't.

08:06.953 --> 08:08.856
I don't want a boyfriend,
Lauren.

08:08.889 --> 08:12.059
Really? You wouldn't
wanna hook up with Austin?

08:12.093 --> 08:15.762
Because, if you
don't nab him soon,

08:15.796 --> 08:17.798
someone else will.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.899
Emily?

08:21.002 --> 08:22.536

08:24.672 --> 08:26.874
- Good morning.
- Good morning!

08:26.906 --> 08:29.976
You look awfully
cheerful this morning.

08:30.011 --> 08:32.713
Sasha's taking me out
to dinner tonight.

08:32.747 --> 08:34.782
- That's great!
- But we don't
want anyone to know,

08:34.814 --> 08:37.718
- so don't tell him I told you.
- Consider it in the vault.

08:37.752 --> 08:42.623
But maybe you could find out
where he's taking me, you know,
just so I know how to dress.

08:42.656 --> 08:44.325
You know, I think, since
we're all working together,

08:44.358 --> 08:46.293
it might be a good idea
if I didn't get in the middle.

08:46.327 --> 08:48.763
Of course. You're right.

08:48.796 --> 08:51.632
Don't tell Sasha I asked you.

08:51.665 --> 08:52.867
I'm gonna go sneak out
for a mani-pedi.

- [Summer] Oh!

08:54.869 --> 08:55.902
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

08:55.935 --> 08:57.772
- [both] Sorry.
- Good morning.

08:59.607 --> 09:01.675
You look awfully
cheerful this morning.

09:01.709 --> 09:05.579
- Yeah, I asked Summer
out to dinner tonight.
- Oh, really?

09:05.613 --> 09:08.081
Mm. But we don't
want anyone to know,
so don't tell her I told you.

09:08.115 --> 09:13.087
- Consider it in the vault.
- Um, do you think she'd
like Le Privilege?

09:13.120 --> 09:15.588
- I've heard it's the best
restaurant in town.
- Me, too.

09:15.623 --> 09:18.659
I'm dying to eat there,
but Mark says it's too pricey.

09:18.691 --> 09:20.628
So you think
I shouldn't take her there?

09:20.661 --> 09:22.730
I think since
we're all working together,

09:22.762 --> 09:24.732
it might be a good idea
if I didn't get in the middle.

09:24.764 --> 09:26.734
Right. Of course.

But don't tell
her I asked you.

to you last night?

09:54.395 --> 09:57.398
I didn't think you'd
expect me after our fight.

09:57.431 --> 10:00.133
- What fight?
- About Emily?

10:00.167 --> 10:05.639
I don't suppose you even
considered apologizing to her
for stealing her choreography?

10:05.673 --> 10:09.642
- What do you care?
- I care because frankly
your behavior is a turnoff.

10:09.677 --> 10:12.112
Well, speaking of turnoffs,

10:12.146 --> 10:15.782
Mr. Nice Guy who always
finishes last around here
isn't exactly a turn-on.

10:15.815 --> 10:18.384
Emily is my competition,

10:18.418 --> 10:21.789

maybe some of the Olympians

10:21.821 --> 10:23.691

will be turned on

Hey, how you doing?

10:40.841 --> 10:42.175
What's up?

10:42.209 --> 10:44.979
Emily and Brian know I
didn't come home last night.

10:45.011 --> 10:48.415
- What did they say?
- They don't care.

10:48.449 --> 10:50.950
The only thing they
care about is that we
get checked out for STIs.

10:50.985 --> 10:54.788
- What happened to STDs?
- Apparently they've changed
"diseases" to "infections."

10:54.822 --> 10:57.090
- Well, I don't have either.
- Neither do I.

10:57.123 --> 11:00.660
But they're right,
we do need to set an example
for practicing safe sex.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.864
Not that we want our
children to be having sex.

11:03.898 --> 11:07.168
I told Lauren if she
has sex before she's 18,
I'm cutting her off.

11:07.200 --> 11:11.704
And believe me,
she won't let anything come
between her and my credit card.

11:11.739 --> 11:16.477
So why don't we have
a romantic dinner tonight

11:16.509 --> 11:21.248
and go back to my place
and not worry if we fall asleep?

11:21.281 --> 11:23.883
- And what about Lauren?
- I'll deal with Lauren.

11:23.918 --> 11:27.721
And in case you've forgotten,
it's our three-month anniversary

11:27.755 --> 11:30.823
so I made a reservation
at Le Privilege.

11:30.858 --> 11:34.728
- Oh, that's so sweet.
- I just want tonight
to be very special.

11:55.014 --> 11:58.151
Because I heard Sasha gave
you guys the day off tomorrow,

11:58.184 --> 12:00.720
so there's no reason you
can't come to my party

12:00.720 --> 12:02.856
except you
must not like me.

12:02.889 --> 12:04.992
I like you.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.761
[grunts]

12:08.796 --> 12:12.099
But Commandant Cruz
does not.

12:12.132 --> 12:16.303
Look, Kaylie's
the team captain

12:16.337 --> 12:18.839
- and she's just...
- Trying to control everyone?

12:18.871 --> 12:20.506
Is that her job?

12:20.540 --> 12:23.943
To nip at your heels
like a little border collie
herding her sheep?

12:23.978 --> 12:26.279
Yip, yip!

12:29.282 --> 12:33.052
I'm sorry your feelings are
hurt, but I just can't come.

12:36.155 --> 12:40.059
[up-tempo music continues]

12:40.094 --> 12:42.930
I would really appreciate it
if you stopped trying

12:42.963 --> 12:45.566
to pressure my girls into
going to your stupid party.

12:45.599 --> 12:48.535
Why are you so scared of your
girls having a little fun?

12:48.569 --> 12:51.304
Or is it that you're scared
of having a little fun?

12:51.338 --> 12:55.342
You might loosen up,
drink a beer, do a keg stand?

12:55.375 --> 13:00.047
- How do you know about that?
- I can't reveal my source.

13:00.079 --> 13:03.584
But the old Kaylie sounds
like she was a lot more fun.

13:03.617 --> 13:08.222
Yeah, well, the old Kaylie
wasn't the National champ
or the team captain,

13:08.254 --> 13:11.325
and it's my job to keep
a grip on my teammates.

13:11.358 --> 13:15.362
Hm... How much you want
to bet they slip through your
grip and come to my party?

13:15.396 --> 13:18.832
How about a week
cleaning the girls' mats?

13:18.866 --> 13:22.870
Make it two. And who knows,
you might even slip through your
own grip and make an appearance.

13:22.903 --> 13:25.271
Believe me, Austin,

13:25.306 --> 13:27.340
I wouldn't be caught
dead at your party.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.849
Hey. So listen, I was thinking
we could head over to my house

13:35.883 --> 13:37.985
and watch last year's
Worlds on DVD again.

13:38.018 --> 13:41.088
- How riveting!
- And then Emily and Payson,

13:41.120 --> 13:43.857
you both could spend the night
and we can wake up early

13:43.891 --> 13:45.325
to run before
practice tomorrow.

13:45.358 --> 13:48.127
So that Kaylie can make
sure Emily doesn't sneak
off to Austin's party.

13:48.162 --> 13:52.099
I can't tonight.
My mom's going out for her
three-month anniversary.

13:52.131 --> 13:54.635
- Gag me.
- I wish.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.369
And I promised Brian I'd
help him with a project.

13:56.403 --> 13:58.038
Which your mom-tramp can't do

13:58.072 --> 14:00.641
because she'll be spending
the night at my house again?

14:00.674 --> 14:03.009
I'll see you guys
in the morning.

14:04.311 --> 14:06.647
I'm in.
I'll meet you at the car.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.181
OK.

14:10.918 --> 14:13.320
Are you really buying
that Brian excuse?

14:13.353 --> 14:15.888
What do you mean?

14:15.923 --> 14:18.257
Didn't you see the way Emily's
eyes lit up when he asked us?

14:18.292 --> 14:21.994
She and Austin have gotten
to be pretty good friends.

14:22.029 --> 14:24.464
If you ask me, I'm not the
only one going to that party.

14:38.478 --> 14:41.314
Lauren, I'd like to explain
to you about this morning.

14:41.347 --> 14:44.051
I wasn't spending the night.
I fell asleep.

14:44.084 --> 14:46.319
After you had sex
with my dad all night?

14:46.352 --> 14:48.321
You know, come to think
of it,

14:48.354 --> 14:50.256
I heard some
high-pitched squeals,

14:50.289 --> 14:52.659
but I thought
it was a cat in heat.

14:52.693 --> 14:54.293
All right.
Listen here, missy.

14:54.327 --> 14:56.964
I know you ran Summer off
with your sass and brass,

14:56.997 --> 15:00.266
but don't think I can't
make your life just as
miserable as you make mine.

15:00.299 --> 15:02.469
Yeah, well, FYI,
I didn't chase Summer off.

15:02.503 --> 15:06.407
My dad dumped her because
I will always come first.

15:06.439 --> 15:10.042
And if he didn't marry Summer,
who he truly loved,

15:10.076 --> 15:12.980
do you think he'd
ever marry you?

15:13.012 --> 15:16.450
You know, honey,
I think it would be very
unwise to underestimate me.

15:16.483 --> 15:18.952
[scoffs]

15:18.986 --> 15:21.320
[Summer] Everything OK?

15:21.355 --> 15:22.688
No.

15:22.722 --> 15:24.724
Chloe's been spending
the night over at our house

15:24.757 --> 15:26.994
and flaunting it in my face.

15:27.027 --> 15:31.432
If it's OK for them
to be having premarital sex
right down the hall,

15:31.464 --> 15:33.700
I guess it's OK
for me to do it, too.

15:33.734 --> 15:38.205
Lauren, remember after
you... [whispers] you lost
your virginity to Carter,

15:38.237 --> 15:41.441
we talked and you decided
to wait until marriage
the next time.

15:41.474 --> 15:46.747
Yes. Which is why I need you to
get back together with my dad.

15:46.780 --> 15:50.517
I need a positive influence
in my life and so does he.

15:50.550 --> 15:53.020
It's not like you're
seeing anyone else, right?

15:54.554 --> 15:55.254
Right.

15:55.289 --> 15:58.725
I know my dad
still loves you.

15:58.759 --> 16:01.961
Can't you just
give it another chance?

16:09.536 --> 16:11.271
Do you think maybe
you're over-training?

16:11.304 --> 16:13.440
You already ran five miles
before practice this morning.

16:13.473 --> 16:17.176
Andre Agassi used to ride the
stationary bike for an hour

16:17.211 --> 16:20.347
before and after
a five-set tennis match.

16:20.379 --> 16:22.416
That's how he got
in such great condition.

16:22.448 --> 16:25.085
He also burned out at one point
and started doing drugs.

16:25.117 --> 16:29.322
[Kaylie] Don't worry about it.
I've got everything
under control.

16:29.356 --> 16:32.059
Hey. Take it from me. You don't
want to risk a serious injury

16:32.092 --> 16:34.161
and have
to start all over again.

16:34.194 --> 16:37.030
You're gonna make
a full comeback, Payson.

16:37.064 --> 16:39.266
And you're gonna be
better than you ever were.

16:39.298 --> 16:43.302
Especially if we all
just focus on training.

16:43.337 --> 16:45.172
And not going
to Austin's party.

16:45.205 --> 16:46.506
Which isn't what you're
thinking about at all.

16:46.539 --> 16:49.042
Wha...?
What are you talking about?

16:49.076 --> 16:52.411
The Kaylie I used to know
would be dying to go
check out that party.

16:52.445 --> 16:55.215
Why does everybody
keep on saying that?

16:55.249 --> 16:57.416
I'm the same Kaylie
I've always been.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.552
I'm just responsible
for the team now,

16:59.586 --> 17:02.788
and what I'm thinking
is that Emily lied.

17:02.822 --> 17:05.558
She went to the party
and she might get into trouble.

17:05.592 --> 17:07.594
Well, if that's really
what you're thinking,

17:07.628 --> 17:09.496
why don't you call her at home
and see if she's there?

17:09.529 --> 17:14.233
Oh. Yeah. Good idea.

Hi, Brian.
This is, um, Kaylie.

17:27.114 --> 17:28.415
Is Emily home?

17:28.447 --> 17:30.484
Uh, no, she
just went to the store.

17:30.516 --> 17:33.086
- Have you tried her cell?
- [Kaylie] No.

17:33.120 --> 17:35.354
- I will. Thanks.
- [beeps]

17:35.389 --> 17:36.623
He said she went to the store.

17:36.656 --> 17:39.559
But he didn't
sound very convincing.

17:41.628 --> 17:45.299
A-ha. And her cell goes
straight to voicemail.

17:45.332 --> 17:47.600
Do you really think she
went to Austin's party?

17:47.634 --> 17:50.103
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

house and see for ourselves.

party looking like this.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.398

restaurant in Boulder.

- Oh.
- Oh, here, let me do that.

a regular here.

here with Steve a lot.

18:44.590 --> 18:47.526
Oh. Well... Well, would you
rather go someplace else?

Oh, no, no, no!
It's wonderful. Really.

about telling Lauren a fib.

strike you down with lightning.

seeing anyone and I said no.

to upset her anymore.

Are you sure you're not the one
who's upset that Chloe's
spending the night with Steve?

19:22.561 --> 19:26.632
I'm only upset about what
message it sends to Lauren.

19:29.603 --> 19:33.740
I'm sorry. I just violated the
most important first date rule.

19:33.773 --> 19:36.609
- Which is?
- Don't talk about your ex.

still have feelings for her.

23:18.698 --> 23:21.434
I am completely
over Summer Van Horn.

23:21.468 --> 23:22.769
And I don't want
to talk about her.

23:22.801 --> 23:24.704
I just want a night
alone with you,

23:24.737 --> 23:27.474
without any blast
from the past

23:27.507 --> 23:30.577
intruding on our
three-month anniversary.

23:30.609 --> 23:34.713
- We didn't order that.
- Oh, yes, I know.

23:34.748 --> 23:36.449
The gentleman over there did.

23:40.553 --> 23:42.756
- What are you doing?
- Trust me.

23:46.825 --> 23:49.696
[hip-hop music plays]

23:49.728 --> 23:51.897
* We the type to get started

23:51.931 --> 23:54.567
[continues indistinct]

23:54.601 --> 23:57.237
* Can't I do it
just how you want it *

23:57.270 --> 24:00.607
* Came to shut down
the party *

24:00.640 --> 24:03.543
Here you are.
Cold off the keg.

24:03.576 --> 24:06.745
- You sure you want this?
- That's what we're here for,
right?

24:06.779 --> 24:10.616
- To drink and have fun?
- You don't have
to drink to have fun.

24:10.649 --> 24:12.551
I'd hate to see the headline,

24:12.584 --> 24:15.788
"National Champ Misses Worlds
Due to Keg Stand Mishap."

24:15.822 --> 24:19.626
Oh. Don't worry.
I'm a big girl.

24:19.658 --> 24:22.795
So, what made you change your
mind about coming to my party?

24:22.829 --> 24:25.632
Uh, I just wanted
to show everyone

24:25.664 --> 24:29.703
that the old fun-loving Kaylie
is still alive and well.

24:34.940 --> 24:36.810
What?
What are you doing?

24:36.842 --> 24:40.547
There's some pepperoni
in your hair.

24:42.615 --> 24:44.917
Oh, uh... Um...

24:44.950 --> 24:48.954
- So is Emily here?
- [sighs] No.

24:48.988 --> 24:50.690
She said she couldn't come.

24:50.724 --> 24:53.660
Oh, I thought she might
have changed her mind.

24:53.693 --> 24:57.831
I'm sure the fun Kaylie will
have a good time without her.

25:07.673 --> 25:08.942
[camera clicks]

25:09.909 --> 25:12.579
Oh, this is gonna be good.

25:16.648 --> 25:19.686
- Hey.
- Hey. Kaylie called.

25:19.718 --> 25:22.622
- Did she say what she wanted?
- Just to see if you were home.

25:22.654 --> 25:25.692
I'll bet.
What did you tell her?

25:25.724 --> 25:28.060
That you went to the store.
What's the big whoop?

25:28.094 --> 25:31.765
She's totally paranoid
that I'm gonna sneak off
to Austin's party.

25:31.797 --> 25:33.832
You know, I'm tempted
to go just to spite her.

25:33.867 --> 25:35.735
[cell phone rings]

25:38.738 --> 25:41.307
Oh, my God!

25:41.341 --> 25:44.611
They must be on a date.
Right?

25:46.613 --> 25:48.782
I can't believe Sasha
would go for Summer

25:48.815 --> 25:49.982
when he could have had me.

25:50.015 --> 25:52.951
[clears throat]
He could've had you?

25:52.985 --> 25:56.088
Oh, you know what I mean.
Someone like me. Someone sexy.

25:56.122 --> 26:00.025
- I think Summer's sexy.
- Oh, really?

26:00.059 --> 26:03.763
Just because she doesn't
believe in premarital sex

26:03.797 --> 26:06.766
- doesn't mean she's not...
- So she's the Madonna
and I'm the...

26:06.800 --> 26:09.735
I should probably go
thank them for the champagne.

26:09.768 --> 26:11.770
I should probably
thank them, too.

26:13.807 --> 26:15.375
Here they come.

26:15.407 --> 26:17.076
I still don't see how
they're gonna believe

26:17.110 --> 26:19.111
this is a business dinner
at Le Privilege.

26:19.145 --> 26:21.648
The idea is to act like
we have nothing to hide. Hi!

26:21.681 --> 26:24.716
Steve, Chloe,
what a lovely surprise.

26:24.751 --> 26:28.655
- Thanks for the champagne.
- My pleasure.

26:28.688 --> 26:33.626
So, what brings the two of you
to such a romantic restaurant?

26:33.660 --> 26:37.397
I wanted to bring my
gym manager out to thank
her for all her hard work.

26:37.430 --> 26:40.800
Really? And what about Kim?
You don't appreciate

26:40.834 --> 26:43.803
her hard work
as much as Summer's?

26:43.837 --> 26:48.708
Here I am! I'm so sorry I'm
late. Traffic was a bear!

26:48.741 --> 26:53.112
Steve, Chloe. What special
occasion brings you out
to such a nice restaurant?

26:53.145 --> 26:56.783
- I dine here often.
- So I've heard.

26:56.816 --> 27:02.789
Um, it's our three-month
anniversary and Stevie
wanted to celebrate.

27:02.821 --> 27:05.023
It's so romantic. [laughs]

27:05.058 --> 27:07.926
I wish I was here
for romance instead of business.

27:07.960 --> 27:11.797
Not that a gym manager
appreciation dinner
isn't a treat.

27:11.830 --> 27:14.900
I hope it's not a treat you plan
on expensing to The Rock?

27:14.934 --> 27:16.870
You've got nothing
to worry about, Steve.
This one's on me.

27:16.902 --> 27:19.672
Well, I'm starving.

27:19.706 --> 27:24.744
We'll excuse ourselves then.
Have a nice appreciation dinner.

27:26.979 --> 27:29.781
- What are you doing here?
- Being your beard, apparently.

27:29.816 --> 27:32.417
And I didn't even get
a chance to wash my hair.

27:32.451 --> 27:35.722
But I finally get
to eat at the best
restaurant in Boulder.

27:35.755 --> 27:37.724
Can I borrow your menu?

27:39.124 --> 27:42.762
- I texted her under the table.
- [sighs]

27:42.795 --> 27:46.165
- What are you doing?
- Waiting for
lightning to strike.

27:48.501 --> 27:52.070
- [rock music plays]
- [indistinct chattering]

27:52.104 --> 27:54.774
[laughs]
I'll be right back.

27:57.744 --> 28:00.847
So, as I predicted,

28:00.880 --> 28:03.816
you just couldn't stay
away from the party.

28:03.849 --> 28:06.486
Or Austin.

28:06.518 --> 28:09.756
I knew those
promise rings were a sham.

28:09.788 --> 28:12.824
And Payson's here, too?
What are you doing?

28:12.858 --> 28:14.860
I got sick of waiting
for you in the car.

28:14.893 --> 28:17.163
Is that a beer? I thought we
were here to look for Emily.

28:17.196 --> 28:19.065
Of course!

28:19.097 --> 28:22.735
I wonder what Emily
would think if she knew
you were checking up on her?

28:22.769 --> 28:25.470
[boy] Hey, Lauren,
we're waiting for you!

28:25.504 --> 28:26.806
Coming!

28:28.775 --> 28:30.143
- Oh, my gosh!
- What?

28:30.175 --> 28:32.278
I just saw Shaun White!
He's really here.

28:32.311 --> 28:34.747
Look, I don't see him.

28:34.781 --> 28:37.517
Look, Emily's not here.
We just should go.

28:37.550 --> 28:40.185
- Do you really want to go?
- We have to go.

28:40.219 --> 28:44.156
What if Emily finds out
we came to the party after
we made her promise not to?

28:44.189 --> 28:45.291
God, I feel like
such an idiot!

28:45.324 --> 28:46.759
Well, you are an idiot,

28:46.793 --> 28:48.093
but I'm not leaving
until I meet Shaun White.

28:48.126 --> 28:50.763
He's a two-time
Olympic gold medalist!

28:50.797 --> 28:53.299
- Payson...
- Two!

28:53.332 --> 28:55.902
I'm surprised to see you here.

28:55.935 --> 28:58.805
Yeah. Because I'm such
a good girl and everyone knows

28:58.838 --> 29:00.172
good girls don't
have any fun.

29:00.205 --> 29:01.740
Just take it easy
on the beer.

29:01.740 --> 29:04.042
Remember the
last time you drank?

29:04.077 --> 29:06.278
Yeah, I did a keg stand,

29:06.312 --> 29:08.781
which apparently was
a lot more memorable

29:08.815 --> 29:10.049
than the gold medal
I won at Nationals.

29:10.082 --> 29:13.119
It was pretty memorable.

29:13.152 --> 29:15.989
Speaking of memorable,
that was also the party

29:16.021 --> 29:17.824
where you hooked up
with my best friend.

29:20.827 --> 29:23.161
Carter...

29:23.196 --> 29:25.230
...I just have to ask.

29:25.265 --> 29:27.532
Why did you
choose Lauren over me?

29:27.566 --> 29:29.869
Because Lauren wanted me,

29:29.901 --> 29:33.072
and I just felt
like you wanted control.

29:38.176 --> 29:42.080
Well, it looks like your new
girlfriend has control now.

29:42.115 --> 29:46.151
Or don't you care that
she flirts with other
guys right in front of you?

29:50.957 --> 29:54.360
So I thought you said
you wouldn't be caught
dead at Austin's party?

29:54.393 --> 29:57.195
Me? Oh... What about you?

29:57.229 --> 30:01.300
[laughs] Well, I was
keeping my promise at home,

30:01.333 --> 30:04.803
when Lauren sent me this.

30:16.648 --> 30:21.187
[reggae music plays]

30:21.219 --> 30:22.755
Look, I only came
to the party

30:22.789 --> 30:26.259
because I thought you
had lied about having to
stay at home with your brother.

30:26.291 --> 30:28.026
And that explains
the beer in your hand.

30:28.061 --> 30:30.897
I haven't even had
a sip of this, Emily.

30:30.930 --> 30:33.866
Well, that's good, because
we all know what happened
the last time you had a sip.

30:33.900 --> 30:37.202
Oh, my God!
If one more person mentions
my keg stand I swear I'm...

30:37.235 --> 30:41.074
What? Try to control
everything we say as well
as everything we do?

30:41.107 --> 30:42.909
It's my job to keep
everybody in line.

30:42.942 --> 30:45.078
Payson, you were
team captain before me.

30:45.111 --> 30:47.880
Tell them what a leader
is supposed to do.

30:50.282 --> 30:53.019
A leader is supposed
to lead by example.

30:53.052 --> 30:55.121
She counsels,
but she doesn't command.

30:58.658 --> 31:01.393
Fine. You want me
to lead by example?

31:01.427 --> 31:02.995
I'm leaving.

31:05.331 --> 31:07.165
She's right.
We should leave.

31:07.199 --> 31:09.268
As soon as I introduce
myself to Bode Miller.

31:09.302 --> 31:11.036
It'll just be a minute.
I'll be right back.

31:11.069 --> 31:14.306
Hey, how about some
girl-on-girl Gumby action?

31:14.340 --> 31:16.208
- Yeah!
- Come on.

31:18.111 --> 31:19.912
What do you say?

31:19.946 --> 31:23.449
Winner makes the loser
do whatever she wants.

31:25.016 --> 31:28.187
- You're on.
- Yeah!

31:39.966 --> 31:43.502
That's a lovely scarf.
Hermes?

31:44.503 --> 31:46.105
Um, yes.

31:46.139 --> 31:49.142
Steve gave it to me
for our anniversary.

31:50.710 --> 31:54.046
I have a drawer full of them.
It's Steve's go-to gift.

31:57.116 --> 32:01.920
Well, it's the only one
that I have and I love it.

32:05.758 --> 32:10.695
Look, Summer,
it's obvious you don't
approve of me dating Steve.

32:10.730 --> 32:14.500
I don't have a problem
with you dating Steve,

32:14.534 --> 32:17.003
but I do have a problem
with you spending the night

32:17.035 --> 32:19.238
at a man's house when he has
a teenage daughter

32:19.271 --> 32:20.138
living under his roof.

32:20.173 --> 32:22.975
I'm sorry you don't
approve of my values.

32:23.009 --> 32:26.245
I'm not questioning
your values.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.480
I'm questioning
your judgment.

32:28.514 --> 32:33.052
If Lauren sees her
father having casual
sex, why can't she?

32:33.084 --> 32:35.221
I wouldn't exactly
call it casual.

32:35.253 --> 32:38.124
The point is you're
sending a message,

32:38.157 --> 32:40.126
not only to his daughter,
but to yours.

32:40.159 --> 32:43.495
And is that the example
you want to set?

32:56.042 --> 32:59.111
Hey, you OK?

32:59.145 --> 33:01.980
You must think
I'm a real a dork now.

33:01.980 --> 33:04.550
Coming to your party
to look for Emily?

33:04.584 --> 33:07.019
I don't think you're a dork.

33:07.053 --> 33:09.521
- I think you're just...
- Trying to control everyone?

33:09.555 --> 33:14.159
I was gonna say
under a lot of pressure
to defend your title.

33:14.192 --> 33:16.362
I know what it's like
to be on top, and the
pressure to stay there

33:16.395 --> 33:18.498
is a lot worse than the
pressure getting there.

33:18.530 --> 33:22.168
How do you deal with it?
You make it seem so easy.

33:22.200 --> 33:23.335
It's not easy, Kaylie.

33:23.369 --> 33:25.505
Everybody's trying to knock
you off and take your place.

33:25.537 --> 33:28.441
Even your friends.

33:28.473 --> 33:31.543
You know, some National
champs could care less
if their teammates tripped up,

33:31.577 --> 33:35.114
especially if it secured
their spot as number one.

33:35.147 --> 33:36.314
You know what's
cool about you?

33:36.349 --> 33:39.451
You want them
to do their best, too.

33:39.484 --> 33:42.088
Yeah, I try, you know?

33:42.121 --> 33:45.057
I mean, I really
want to inspire them.

33:45.091 --> 33:49.061
I try to get them to practice
harder, to focus more.

33:49.095 --> 33:52.330
I try to look the other way when
the girl who was like my sister

33:52.365 --> 33:55.268
talks every day
in detail about

33:55.301 --> 33:57.636
having sex with the only guy
I've ever loved.

34:00.106 --> 34:01.506
Wow, I shouldn't
have said that.

34:01.540 --> 34:04.477
Why? It sucks.

34:04.510 --> 34:06.578
And look at you.

34:06.612 --> 34:09.081
You still treat
her like a teammate.

34:09.115 --> 34:11.216
Yeah, well...

34:11.249 --> 34:15.320
Everybody's right.
I have been uptight,

34:15.354 --> 34:17.857
and controlling, but...

34:17.889 --> 34:21.526
...the old, fun-loving,
boy-crazy Kaylie wasn't a winner

34:21.561 --> 34:25.364
or a team leader,
and I guess I just don't
know how to be everything.

34:25.397 --> 34:30.369
Sometimes it helps
to stop thinking so much
and just let go a little.

34:30.402 --> 34:32.203
How?

34:41.546 --> 34:43.649
What are you thinking
about right now?

34:44.583 --> 34:48.154
- Nothing.
- That's how.

34:50.156 --> 34:52.258
I'll see you at The Rock.

34:52.291 --> 34:55.328
And hey, thanks
for coming to my party.

34:55.361 --> 34:57.229
Whatever the reason.

36:05.563 --> 36:07.533
[sighs] Let me see.

36:07.566 --> 36:11.503
I won, so I get to choose
what Emily has to do.

36:19.278 --> 36:23.249
So, what Emily has to do is...

36:23.282 --> 36:27.219
...accept my apology for
stealing your choreography

36:27.253 --> 36:30.289
and ruining
your custom leotard.

36:32.258 --> 36:33.292
I...

36:33.324 --> 36:36.395
I accept your apology.

36:40.533 --> 36:42.334
- I thought you left.
- The cops are here.

36:42.368 --> 36:44.669
- So?
- There's underage drinking
going on.

36:44.703 --> 36:46.305
- We're not drinking.
- They don't know that.

36:46.338 --> 36:48.374
What if Sasha finds out
we went to a party?

36:48.407 --> 36:50.675
- Come on, this way.
- [man] We better get
out of here.

36:51.609 --> 36:53.446
Oh, wait! No, no, other way!

36:53.479 --> 36:56.681
- Go, hurry!
- [gasps] My purse!

37:02.220 --> 37:05.324
Excuse me, young lady.

37:05.357 --> 37:07.392
Do you know if minors have
been drinking here today?

37:07.426 --> 37:09.694
- Um...
- We can't just leave her here.

37:09.729 --> 37:14.332
- What are we supposed to do?
- Cause a distraction.

37:14.365 --> 37:16.302
Do you know who lives here?

37:16.334 --> 37:19.838
- Um...
- [cheering]

37:22.774 --> 37:24.677
Hey, Auggie,
get a load of this.

37:24.709 --> 37:27.579
[cheering]

37:28.713 --> 37:30.849
[dance music plays]

37:44.363 --> 37:46.398
[siren wails]

37:49.435 --> 37:51.337
[police radio chatter]

37:54.106 --> 37:56.842
- How do we get out of here?
- Uh...

37:56.875 --> 37:59.311
Swim!

37:59.345 --> 38:01.480
* Yeah, you've been

38:01.514 --> 38:04.783
- * We've been lying
- * All this time

38:04.816 --> 38:08.453
- * Yeah, you've been
- * We've been lying

38:08.487 --> 38:11.857
* Yeah, you've been
all this time **

38:14.559 --> 38:18.563
- I'd ask you in, but...
- Yeah. Some first date, right?

38:18.597 --> 38:20.632
No. It would've been great.

38:20.666 --> 38:24.068
I... I feel like I ruined it.
I'm so sorry.

38:24.102 --> 38:26.704
You didn't ruin anything.

38:26.739 --> 38:29.507
Maybe trying to be
too discreet is a bad idea.

38:29.542 --> 38:31.343
It's not like
we're doing anything wrong.

38:31.377 --> 38:34.880
- I just don't want
to disappoint anyone.
- You mean Lauren?

38:34.913 --> 38:39.351
Is it really better for her
to think there's a chance
for you and her father?

38:39.385 --> 38:41.619
No.

38:41.654 --> 38:43.889
I want her to have a
good role model in her life.

38:43.922 --> 38:47.692
Who doesn't believe
in premarital sex?

38:47.725 --> 38:49.895
Not everyone can live up
to your high values.

38:49.928 --> 38:51.696
Well, can you?

38:51.729 --> 38:54.766
Do you think I'm the kind of man
that would ask you out

38:54.799 --> 38:57.536
if I wasn't prepared
to respect your values?

38:59.138 --> 39:00.506
No.

39:00.539 --> 39:01.940
OK.

39:04.410 --> 39:06.478
I'll see you in the morning.

39:12.784 --> 39:14.420
Hey.

39:16.621 --> 39:20.158
I know this is
our first date, but...

39:20.191 --> 39:22.661
...would it be all right
if I kissed you good night?

39:24.762 --> 39:26.532
Well, it is a little forward,

39:26.564 --> 39:29.834
but I think it
might be all right.

39:40.979 --> 39:46.185
Why can't we just go
to a party and have a
good time like normal girls?

39:46.218 --> 39:48.920
- Because we're not normal.
- And if we want
to go to the Olympics,

39:48.954 --> 39:51.657
we can't do the things
that normal girls can do.

39:51.689 --> 39:54.426
- Like have boyfriends?
- Eat anything we want.

39:54.460 --> 39:56.462
- Or go to a real school.
- Or have real friends

39:56.495 --> 40:00.966
- because we spend all
of our time at the gym.
- We're not real friends?

40:02.400 --> 40:03.636
I don't know.

40:03.668 --> 40:06.170
Sometimes I'm not
sure what we are.

40:06.205 --> 40:09.909
- It's really complicated.
- Because we're competitors?

40:09.941 --> 40:12.844
We're also teammates.

40:12.878 --> 40:14.213
What are friends,

40:14.245 --> 40:16.915
besides people who have
something in common.

40:16.949 --> 40:18.784
Which we do.

40:18.816 --> 40:20.920
We have a dream in common
which is a greater bond

40:20.952 --> 40:23.688
than all having a crush
on the same rock star

40:23.722 --> 40:25.823
or going shopping
together at the mall.

40:25.858 --> 40:29.995
Sometimes I feel like
we're in military boot camp,

40:30.028 --> 40:32.932
in the same company
with the same mission,

40:32.964 --> 40:34.866
but only one of us
makes it out alive.

40:34.899 --> 40:37.636
Yeah, and we have
a maniacal drill sergeant

40:37.670 --> 40:38.970
making all our lives miserable.

40:39.004 --> 40:41.607
And that would be me?

40:41.640 --> 40:43.975
You have been
a little intense lately.

40:44.009 --> 40:47.812
[sighs] I know.
And I'm sorry.

40:47.845 --> 40:50.616
I'm just trying to be
the leader that Payson was.

40:50.649 --> 40:53.818
You were so strong
and sure of yourself.

40:53.851 --> 40:56.488
It made us all
feel really safe.

40:56.522 --> 41:00.659
And I guess I don't
know how to do that.

41:00.693 --> 41:02.460
And when Sasha said
that I was responsible

41:02.460 --> 41:04.063
for all of your failures,

41:04.095 --> 41:07.866
- I took that seriously.
- He shouldn't have
put that on you.

41:07.900 --> 41:10.635
We're each responsible
for the choices we make.

41:10.668 --> 41:11.903
And it's only
self-determination

41:11.937 --> 41:13.539
that's gonna get us
to the Olympics.

41:13.571 --> 41:16.542
- She's right.
- It's true.

41:16.574 --> 41:19.044
And look, the promise
to work hard and stay focused

41:19.077 --> 41:22.947
is one we can only make to
ourselves, not to each other.

41:25.016 --> 41:28.953
So... I guess we won't be
needing these anymore.

41:36.894 --> 41:39.797
From now on,
I will only lead by example.

41:39.832 --> 41:40.999
I will totally support you,

41:41.032 --> 41:44.536
but I will not
try to control you.

41:44.570 --> 41:47.539
- Agreed?
- [all] Agreed.

41:47.573 --> 41:49.107
[all laugh]

42:04.022 --> 42:08.626
So, what do you say we take
these into the bedroom?

42:09.627 --> 42:11.830
Actually, no.

42:13.031 --> 42:14.066
I've been thinking about it,

42:14.099 --> 42:16.068
and I don't think
we're sending

42:16.101 --> 42:19.104
the right message,
for us to be carrying on

42:19.137 --> 42:21.072
with a teenaged girl
in the house.

42:21.106 --> 42:22.775
What's gotten into you?

42:22.807 --> 42:26.045
I just don't think you and me
having casual sex

42:26.077 --> 42:30.081
sets the right example
for our daughters, or my son.

42:30.115 --> 42:33.852
Sex should be between two people
who truly care about each other

42:33.885 --> 42:37.723
and are at least...
exclusive.

42:37.756 --> 42:40.626
Do you think
I'm seeing anyone else?

42:40.659 --> 42:42.994
I don't know.
We never talked about it.

42:43.027 --> 42:45.798
Well, I'm not.
And I don't want to.

42:45.831 --> 42:49.067
- And I hope you don't either.
- I don't.

42:49.100 --> 42:52.805
Well... OK. Good.

42:52.838 --> 42:55.973
- [laughs]
- So, what do you say

42:56.007 --> 42:59.577
when we want to "carry on,"
we go to a hotel?

43:01.079 --> 43:03.882
That sounds romantic.

43:03.916 --> 43:05.116
How about now?

43:05.150 --> 43:09.822
How about during
the day or early evening

43:09.855 --> 43:11.689
so I can get home
to my kids at a decent hour?

43:11.722 --> 43:14.893
I have to set
an example there, too.

43:14.926 --> 43:17.129
OK.

43:17.162 --> 43:20.632
- So, what would you like to do?
- Um...

43:20.666 --> 43:22.668
Well, we haven't
had dessert yet.

43:22.701 --> 43:24.970
Have you ever had fried ice
cream and chocolate sauce?

43:25.002 --> 43:29.641
- Uh, can't say I have.
- Then you are in
for a big treat!

43:29.675 --> 43:32.644
Do you have a deep fryer?
Or a wok will do in a pinch.

43:32.678 --> 43:36.815
I think we might have
a wok in one of the boxes
in the garage attic.

43:36.849 --> 43:40.017
- I'll go look.
- No, why don't you
go get some vanilla ice cream

43:40.051 --> 43:43.956
and some dark sweet chocolate.
And I will go find the wok.

43:53.765 --> 43:54.833
Oh! [gasps]
