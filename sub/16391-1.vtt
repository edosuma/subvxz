WEBVTT

01:08.869 --> 01:12.206
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

01:12.240 --> 01:14.708
SHEPHERD: This evening
we are very proud
to honor a gentleman

01:14.742 --> 01:17.311
who's written over 17
motion pictures.

01:17.345 --> 01:20.314
Many of them having dealt
with the human condition.

01:20.348 --> 01:23.384
This gentleman was nominated
for an Academy Award in 1993

01:23.417 --> 01:25.786
for his motion picture,
McCormick Place.

01:25.819 --> 01:28.656
Tonight,
along with the other
distinguished artists,

01:28.689 --> 01:32.226
we are proud to
award this year's
Humanitarian Prize

01:32.260 --> 01:34.128
to Mr. Steven Phillips!

01:34.162 --> 01:35.629
(ALL APPLAUDING)

01:44.238 --> 01:45.439
Congratulations.

01:49.177 --> 01:51.412
Thank you very much.

01:51.445 --> 01:56.250
You know, I would not
even be here tonight
if it wasn't for my family.

01:56.284 --> 01:58.652
My beautiful wife, Laura,

01:58.686 --> 02:01.622
my daughters,
Mary and Julie.

02:01.655 --> 02:04.392
Without their
love and support,
God knows, I...

02:04.425 --> 02:07.828
I'm sure I would be
down on Western Avenue
in some seedy bar.

02:07.861 --> 02:08.895
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

02:08.929 --> 02:11.932
Not that I'm not
going there anyway.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.601
It's just I'll drop
you guys off first.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.203
(ALL LAUGHING)

02:16.437 --> 02:19.373
Being a screenwriter
in Hollywood

02:19.407 --> 02:23.477
is... It's a lot like
being a eunuch in an orgy.

02:23.511 --> 02:27.181
The only difference is,
the eunuchs get to watch

02:27.215 --> 02:28.749
and I'm not even invited
to the set.

02:28.782 --> 02:31.419
(ALL LAUGHING)

02:31.452 --> 02:32.920
I really don't know
how to thank you.

02:32.953 --> 02:35.656
I... I do appreciate it.

02:35.689 --> 02:38.226
As soon as I get home,
I'm going to
put this up there

02:38.259 --> 02:40.661
on the mantel
with the other ones,

02:40.694 --> 02:42.630
and that will make
a total of two.

02:42.663 --> 02:45.199
(ALL LAUGHING)

02:45.233 --> 02:49.870
Thank you very much.
And I'm king of the room!

02:53.574 --> 02:54.708
Thank you.

03:03.384 --> 03:04.852
This looks like a penis.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.654
What did you say?
What?

03:06.687 --> 03:08.356
Where did you learn
that word?

03:08.389 --> 03:09.290
From Howard Stern.

03:09.323 --> 03:11.392
You're not supposed
to be listening to him.

03:11.425 --> 03:12.960
Why is she
listening to him?

03:12.993 --> 03:14.862
No more FM.
That's off-limits to you.

03:14.895 --> 03:16.530
They say that word
on AM, too.

03:16.564 --> 03:18.332
Then no more radio
of any kind.

03:18.366 --> 03:19.800
Never listen to
the radio again.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.269
What's wrong
with "penis"?

03:21.302 --> 03:24.438
I don't want to
hear that word, girls.

03:24.472 --> 03:25.973
Unless we're in
a doctor's office.

03:26.006 --> 03:29.277
That word is off-limits
to the family.

03:29.310 --> 03:31.312
So, when do you start
shooting the new one?

03:31.345 --> 03:32.913
Well, first they have to
give me a go,

03:32.946 --> 03:34.548
and then they'll do
the casting.

03:34.582 --> 03:35.449
What's a go?

03:35.483 --> 03:37.818
It's when they say "yes,"
sweetheart.

03:37.851 --> 03:38.952
When do you think
you'll hear?

03:38.986 --> 03:41.855
I should have
heard already.
Probably this week.

03:41.889 --> 03:43.524
So, who is going
to be in it?

03:43.557 --> 03:44.592
I don't know.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.560
Can I star in
the movie, Daddy?

03:46.594 --> 03:49.297
Yes, darling,
as soon as you're
an older man.

04:08.015 --> 04:09.783
STEVEN: Good night.
Good night.

04:09.817 --> 04:11.919
Congratulations, Daddy.
I love you.

04:11.952 --> 04:13.821
I love you.
I'm so happy
you were there.

04:13.854 --> 04:14.988
Me, too.

04:15.022 --> 04:17.858
It was really important to me.
Don't stay up too late.

04:17.891 --> 04:18.892
Okay.

04:22.563 --> 04:24.465
Good night, baby.

04:24.498 --> 04:27.535
Daddy, what exactly
is a humanitarian?

04:27.568 --> 04:30.003
It's someone who's
never won the Oscar.

04:30.704 --> 04:31.939
Go to sleep.

05:03.537 --> 05:05.806
Hello, hello.
Hello.

05:05.839 --> 05:07.975
Josh read your script,
and he's ready to see you.

05:08.008 --> 05:09.042
How did he sound?

05:09.076 --> 05:10.344
He sounded great.

05:23.591 --> 05:25.493
Hey, Steven.
Come on in.

05:31.665 --> 05:34.034
Oh. Nice.
Nice couch.

05:34.067 --> 05:35.836
Did you see
Saving Private Ryan?

05:35.869 --> 05:37.137
No, I didn't.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.739
That's the couch
they used in the picture.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.941
Oh.

05:40.974 --> 05:43.844
I love to get props
before anybody else does.

05:43.877 --> 05:46.480
You know,
it's sort of like
a collecting thing.

05:46.514 --> 05:49.650
Someday all this stuff
is going to be
worth a fortune.

05:49.683 --> 05:53.153
Gee, does Paramount
let you take all this stuff
when you leave here?

05:53.186 --> 05:54.822
Who says I'm leaving here?

05:54.855 --> 05:58.125
No, I just meant if.

05:58.158 --> 06:00.528
I'll worry about that
when the time comes.

06:00.561 --> 06:01.995
Did you eat?

06:02.029 --> 06:04.998
No. Well, you know,
had a little Jell-O.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.567
Come on.
I'll treat you to lunch.

06:06.600 --> 06:07.968
Oh, great.

06:12.005 --> 06:13.507
Is that blood?

06:17.711 --> 06:20.648
Hey, congratulations
on that humanitarian thing.

06:22.215 --> 06:25.018
Thank you.
You make it sound
so important.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.687
What was that
for exactly?

06:26.720 --> 06:28.088
What do you mean?

06:28.121 --> 06:30.458
Was it for this year?

06:30.491 --> 06:34.528
Oh, it wasn't for
any particular year.
It was for a career.

06:34.562 --> 06:36.730
Well, it's wonderful.

06:36.764 --> 06:38.499
You had a great career.

06:39.567 --> 06:41.435
What do you mean "had"?

06:41.469 --> 06:43.571
I'm still having it,
aren't I?

06:46.574 --> 06:48.108
I read your script.

06:48.141 --> 06:50.110
And?

06:50.143 --> 06:52.713
Well, let me
put this in a form
that isn't insulting.

06:52.746 --> 06:53.947
Because I tend
to be too direct.

06:53.981 --> 06:56.183
All my friends
tell me that.

06:56.216 --> 06:58.619
The script's no good.

06:58.652 --> 07:01.889
That's the form
that's not insulting?

07:01.922 --> 07:03.724
What would
the insulting form be?

07:03.757 --> 07:05.425
(LAUGHS) Good one.

07:06.594 --> 07:07.695
What are you doing?

07:07.728 --> 07:11.499
Oh, I write down
lines I like.
I like that line.

07:11.532 --> 07:14.001
Yeah, I think
that's called stealing.

07:14.034 --> 07:17.505
So, what's wrong
with the script?
I don't understand.

07:17.538 --> 07:20.874
I think what's wrong
with the script is you.

07:20.908 --> 07:22.743
It was not that
the script, per se,
is bad.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.745
You know, it's flat.

07:24.778 --> 07:27.147
It feels like it's
been done before.

07:27.180 --> 07:29.249
Well, it has
been done before.
Right.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.585
It's an action movie.
It's been done
a million times,

07:31.619 --> 07:34.588
but you guys
keep making them,
so here's a good one.

07:34.622 --> 07:35.923
LAMAS: Josh.
How's it going?

07:35.956 --> 07:38.792
Hey, Lorenzo,
I was just talking
about you.

07:38.826 --> 07:40.994
Lorenzo Lamas,
Steven Phillips.

07:41.028 --> 07:42.963
Hey. Nice to meet you.

07:42.996 --> 07:46.634
Hey, hey. I'm halfway
through your script.
It's brilliant.

07:46.667 --> 07:47.835
LAMAS: Thank you.

07:47.868 --> 07:51.038
I'll call you tomorrow.
Really great work.

07:51.071 --> 07:53.106
Wow. Thank you so much.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.542
Nice meeting you.

07:54.575 --> 07:55.809
Yeah.

07:57.578 --> 08:00.981
So, give me notes.
I'll fix whatever's wrong.

08:01.014 --> 08:02.983
It's beyond notes.

08:03.016 --> 08:04.818
Oh, nothing's beyond notes.
I'm a writer.

08:04.852 --> 08:06.620
What do you want done?

08:06.654 --> 08:08.656
Listen to me.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.123
Did you ever stop
and think

08:10.157 --> 08:11.625
maybe you're at
that point in your life

08:11.659 --> 08:13.126
where you should be
heading in a new direction?

08:13.160 --> 08:14.294
What?

08:14.327 --> 08:15.896
I read in
the Wall Street Journal

08:15.929 --> 08:17.798
where everybody has
at least three careers.

08:17.831 --> 08:18.699
Did you read that?

08:18.732 --> 08:20.267
No.
Well...

08:20.300 --> 08:23.804
Possibly,
writing is something
you shouldn't do anymore.

08:23.837 --> 08:26.774
I mean,
maybe you're heading
for your third career.

08:26.807 --> 08:28.609
I never had
a second career.

08:28.642 --> 08:30.110
Okay, you're heading
for your second career.

08:30.143 --> 08:31.945
No, I'm not heading
for anything.

08:31.979 --> 08:34.815
I'm a damn good writer.
I just got a major award.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.683
(LAUGHING) What,
the Humanitarian Award?

08:36.717 --> 08:39.653
Please.
Everybody gets that.
That's nothing.

08:39.687 --> 08:41.722
Oh, thank you, Josh.

08:41.755 --> 08:45.058
You know,
I couldn't put my finger on
exactly what the award was.

08:45.092 --> 08:48.028
I just think
you've lost your edge.

08:49.229 --> 08:50.263
I see.

08:51.264 --> 08:53.000
Okay.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.068
So you guys
don't want to
make this movie.

08:55.102 --> 08:56.036
You'll give to me
in turn around,

08:56.069 --> 08:57.270
I'll make it
somewhere else.

08:57.304 --> 09:00.107
That's not exactly
what I'm trying to say.

09:00.140 --> 09:01.842
I don't think
your deal here
is going to work out.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.143
What?

09:03.176 --> 09:04.645
We don't want to
keep rejecting your work

09:04.678 --> 09:06.614
just to fill
a three-picture deal.

09:06.647 --> 09:09.082
You know, go.
Go take some time off.

09:09.116 --> 09:12.219
Get your edge back.
It'll be good
for your head.

09:12.252 --> 09:15.055
Oh, please don't tell me
what's good for my head.

09:15.088 --> 09:17.057
I can't afford
to take time off.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.259
I have a family.
I have to make an income.

09:19.292 --> 09:21.361
That's not our problem.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.864
I can't believe that
all of this happened
over one script.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.799
Oh, it wasn't
just one script.

09:25.833 --> 09:28.368
I mean, we were all
a little disappointed
in your last picture.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.103
Everybody said
it did well.

09:30.137 --> 09:31.739
Everybody lied.

09:32.205 --> 09:33.641
Hello, Josh.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.142
Hey, Jennifer.

09:35.175 --> 09:37.745
You never called me.
What happened?

09:37.778 --> 09:39.012
Oh, I thought I did.

09:39.046 --> 09:40.648
No, no.
You never called me.

09:40.681 --> 09:42.883
Oh, well, Jennifer Tilly,
this is...

09:42.916 --> 09:43.917
I don't want to meet
any more people

09:43.951 --> 09:45.285
at this moment
in my life.

09:45.318 --> 09:46.887
Just do what you
need to do.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.822
Fine. Listen,
I'll call you tomorrow.

09:48.856 --> 09:50.157
I promise.

09:50.190 --> 09:51.391
You promise?

09:51.424 --> 09:53.160
You have my word.

09:53.193 --> 09:54.962
Isn't Josh a doll?

09:54.995 --> 09:58.031
Oh, yeah.
No, he is really a doll.

09:58.065 --> 10:00.033
He's a regular
little Chucky.

10:04.171 --> 10:06.273
So, just cut to the chase.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.976
Just what exactly
are you telling me?

10:09.009 --> 10:10.343
We'd like you
out of here by 5:00.

10:10.377 --> 10:11.411
What?

10:11.444 --> 10:13.046
It would really
help us out.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.314
Brian De Palma
needs your office.

10:14.347 --> 10:17.150
What? You can't give
Brian De Palma my office.

10:17.184 --> 10:18.786
Well, it's not really
your office.

10:18.819 --> 10:20.921
I mean,
we're all just
using space here.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.990
You know, I'm where
Lucille Ball used to be.

10:23.023 --> 10:25.058
Huh.
Too bad you're not
where she is now.

10:25.092 --> 10:27.094
Good one.

10:27.127 --> 10:30.798
You write that down,
I'll cut off your head.

10:30.831 --> 10:31.999
HAL ON PHONE: Yeah,
I knew that's what

10:32.032 --> 10:33.266
he was going to say.
He called me first.

10:33.300 --> 10:36.003
So why didn't you
tell me and save me
the embarrassment?

10:36.036 --> 10:38.939
Well, you're a persuasive guy.
I thought maybe you'd
change his mind.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.408
STEVEN: So we'll set it up
elsewhere, right?

10:41.441 --> 10:42.910
I think that's going
to be tough, Steven.

10:42.943 --> 10:45.345
I've been looking into it.
They don't seem to wanna
make action anymore.

10:45.378 --> 10:46.680
What are you
talking about?

10:46.714 --> 10:48.248
That's all they make
is action.

10:48.281 --> 10:50.050
They don't want to make
this kind of action.

10:50.083 --> 10:51.318
It's not
your forte, anyway.

10:51.351 --> 10:53.086
You should go back to
writing the smaller films.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.788
You told me
not to do that.

10:54.822 --> 10:56.957
That's right, I did,
and that was
very good advice,

10:56.990 --> 10:58.826
because they're not really
buying those, either.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.660
You know what?
Maybe now is the time
to go into television.

11:02.295 --> 11:05.966
Find an independent.
I'll take less money.
Set it up that way.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.035
I've been trying. I can't.
Nobody's buying.

11:08.068 --> 11:11.038
Well, I don't understand.
What's the criticism?

11:11.071 --> 11:12.439
People say
it has no edge.

11:12.472 --> 11:14.908
I keep hearing this
"no edge" bullshit.

11:14.942 --> 11:16.910
I don't even know
what this means.

11:16.944 --> 11:19.479
It's an action movie.
There's plenty of edge.

11:19.512 --> 11:23.083
Look, give me a week,
I'll fix it.
It'll be all edge.

11:23.116 --> 11:24.484
Look, it's not
just this script.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.319
The other two are
getting the same comments.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.889
There's people...
I don't agree with them.

11:28.922 --> 11:31.358
They think you're...
How shall I put this?

11:32.760 --> 11:34.061
Past your prime.

11:34.094 --> 11:35.896
Past my prime?

11:35.929 --> 11:38.932
Picasso painted
until he was 90,
for God's sake.

11:38.966 --> 11:41.268
Yeah. But he never wrote
a good screenplay.

11:41.301 --> 11:42.435
You know what you should do?
Cool out.

11:42.469 --> 11:44.404
Take a year off.
Clear your head.

11:44.437 --> 11:48.341
I can't take a year off, Hal.
I have a family to feed.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.043
Get me a meeting
with Steven Spielberg.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.111
(LAUGHS)

11:51.144 --> 11:53.246
He'll make this movie.
I know it.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.481
Steve doesn't take
meetings anymore.

11:54.514 --> 11:55.749
He'll take this one.

11:55.783 --> 11:59.086
We're old friends.
I used to buy him sushi
25 years ago.

11:59.119 --> 12:01.889
I just read in some magazine
where he doesn't eat sushi
anymore.

12:01.922 --> 12:04.124
(YELLING) Who cares
about the sushi?

12:04.157 --> 12:06.126
Just get me a meeting
with him.

12:20.573 --> 12:21.975
Hello.

12:22.009 --> 12:23.243
Yes, sir.

12:23.276 --> 12:25.145
Yes. I'm here to see
Mr. Spielberg.

12:25.178 --> 12:27.180
What is your name?
Steven Phillips.

12:32.853 --> 12:34.454
You don't have
a drive-on.
Mmm?

12:34.487 --> 12:36.189
You'll have to make
a U-turn here,

12:36.223 --> 12:38.158
park across the street
and walk.

12:38.191 --> 12:39.526
Do you know
where the building is?

12:39.559 --> 12:41.995
Yeah, it's like
nine miles from here.

12:42.029 --> 12:43.196
It is a little far.

12:43.230 --> 12:44.264
I don't have
a drive-on?

12:44.297 --> 12:45.899
No, sir,
you have a walk-on.

12:45.933 --> 12:48.168
Uh-huh. Is that the worst
a person can get,

12:48.201 --> 12:50.170
or is there
like a crawl-on?

12:50.203 --> 12:51.338
Beg your pardon?

12:51.371 --> 12:52.940
Never mind. Thanks.

13:12.092 --> 13:14.494
FEMALE GUIDE ON SPEAKER:
On your right
are the soundstages

13:14.527 --> 13:18.832
where they filmed
the movie Liar Liar.

13:18.866 --> 13:23.370
On your left is a man
who obviously
did not get a drive-on.

13:33.881 --> 13:35.883

(PHONES RINGING)

14:04.411 --> 14:05.512
May I help you?

14:05.545 --> 14:07.080
My name is
Steven Phillips.

14:07.114 --> 14:09.116
I'm here to see
Mr. Spielberg.

14:26.599 --> 14:28.168
Here you go.
You go to
the second floor.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.469
It's office 202.

14:29.502 --> 14:30.971
Thanks.

14:41.949 --> 14:45.018
Yes, sir. Well,
you have an appointment
right now.

14:46.019 --> 14:48.355
I think the gentleman
is here.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.323
Yes, I'll send him
right in.

14:51.091 --> 14:52.225
Are you Mr. Phillips?

14:52.259 --> 14:53.360
Yes, I am.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.028
Mr. Spielberg will see you.

14:55.062 --> 14:56.229
Thank you.

14:59.199 --> 15:00.934
(VIDEO GAME BEEPING)

15:02.335 --> 15:05.172
Come in. Close the door.
We'll have some privacy.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.510
I would get up,
but my feet hurt.

15:10.543 --> 15:11.644
Have a seat.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.080
Who are you?

15:13.113 --> 15:15.949
I'm Stan Spielberg.
I'm Steven's cousin.

15:16.683 --> 15:18.151
Call me Stan.

15:19.052 --> 15:20.687
You're a writer?

15:20.720 --> 15:23.490
Yeah, but...
Where's Steven?

15:23.523 --> 15:26.159
I haven't seen Steven
in almost a year.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.095
Oh, no.

15:28.128 --> 15:30.730
I saw him
on television once.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.365
Anyway, let's get
down to business.

15:32.399 --> 15:34.334
What did you write?
What?

15:34.367 --> 15:37.237
I have a lot of things
on my mind.

15:37.270 --> 15:39.672
What did you do?

15:39.706 --> 15:43.710
Oh, oh, you did
the talking dog thing.

15:43.743 --> 15:47.380
Listen to me, my friend.
It's been done before.

15:47.414 --> 15:50.017
I did not do anything
about a talking dog.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.451
Really?

15:55.788 --> 15:59.126
What did the guy who's
in here now write?

15:59.159 --> 16:02.729
Oh, that's right.
I hated it. Thanks.

16:04.397 --> 16:07.267
Well, apparently,
I didn't like yours, either.

16:07.300 --> 16:10.337
Uh-huh. What is it that
you do here, exactly?

16:10.370 --> 16:13.273
You know, I don't...
I don't really know.

16:13.306 --> 16:17.210
Steven gave me the job,
and I never questioned it.

16:17.244 --> 16:19.046
What did you do
before this?
I'm just curious.

16:19.079 --> 16:21.681
This is my first
real employment.

16:22.682 --> 16:24.717
All right, we're done.
Thanks.

16:25.718 --> 16:27.354
Just remember...

16:27.387 --> 16:31.324
Make it in color.
The people love color.

16:34.194 --> 16:37.497
I've hit the wall.
My career has
hit the wall.

16:37.530 --> 16:40.133
I have no other
options now.
There's nowhere to turn.

16:40.167 --> 16:42.402
Talk to Jack,
he'll make you
feel better.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.537
I don't want to do that.
It's humiliating.

16:44.571 --> 16:46.573
Why is it humiliating?
That's what friends are for.

16:46.606 --> 16:49.476
But, you know,
he'll pity me
and that's no good.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.311
Why don't you
write something
for his company?

16:51.344 --> 16:52.545
He hasn't asked me.

16:52.579 --> 16:54.614
Well, if he knew
the deal fell through,
maybe he would.

16:54.647 --> 16:56.416
I don't want charity.

16:56.449 --> 16:59.219
Go talk to him.
You're the same age.

16:59.252 --> 17:00.687
Nobody's telling him
he's over the hill.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.489
Isn't he doing
better now than ever?

17:02.522 --> 17:04.223
Yeah. I guess.

17:04.257 --> 17:05.325
He'll put things
in perspective.

17:05.358 --> 17:06.393
He knows what
you're going through.

17:06.425 --> 17:08.661
I'm sure once in his life
a studio has told him

17:08.694 --> 17:11.098
the same thing
they're telling you.

17:11.131 --> 17:13.400
Okay, I'll talk to him.

18:08.321 --> 18:11.124
So, how's it going,
buddy? You look bad.

18:11.158 --> 18:14.361
Oh, Jack, I'm having
a terrible week.

18:14.394 --> 18:16.729
Well, what's the matter?

18:16.763 --> 18:18.331
You in trouble? Money?

18:18.365 --> 18:21.768
No, it's not money.
Not yet, anyway.

18:21.801 --> 18:23.836
Well, what's the problem?

18:23.870 --> 18:26.373
Well, before
we get to me...

18:26.406 --> 18:28.208
Are you having an affair?

18:29.909 --> 18:31.611
(CHUCKLES)
Why would you say that?

18:31.644 --> 18:34.314
Who was the woman
that got in the cab?

18:34.347 --> 18:36.149
You saw that?

18:36.183 --> 18:38.318
Well, I'm...
I wasn't spying
or anything.

18:38.351 --> 18:40.620
I just arrived
when it happened.

18:40.653 --> 18:41.854
I can't talk about it.

18:41.888 --> 18:43.723
You're having an affair.

18:43.756 --> 18:47.227
No, no. No, no, I'm not.
I just can't talk about it.

18:47.260 --> 18:49.662
Come on, I'm your friend.
I'll keep a secret.
Who is she?

18:49.696 --> 18:52.299
Don't ask me
any questions about this.

18:52.832 --> 18:53.900
Okay.

18:53.933 --> 18:55.335
Let's just drop it.

18:55.368 --> 18:57.670
How's...
How's your new script?

18:57.704 --> 19:01.441
Oh, great.
Paramount is not
going to make it.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.776
Why? That was a...
That was a great idea.
They don't like it?

19:03.810 --> 19:06.879
Oh, it's way beyond that.
They've stopped liking me.

19:06.913 --> 19:08.948
They terminated
my deal.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.317
You're kidding.

19:10.350 --> 19:12.752
They're telling me
I've lost my edge.

19:12.785 --> 19:15.422
This is the worst week
I've ever had in my life.

19:15.455 --> 19:16.823
Buddy.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.691
Seven days ago,
I was on top of the world.

19:18.725 --> 19:21.794
Now it's over.
It's just over for me.

19:21.828 --> 19:24.364
You've had
this feeling before. Yes?

19:25.665 --> 19:26.766
No.

19:26.799 --> 19:30.603
No? No one's ever told you
that you're over the hill?

19:30.637 --> 19:32.472
No, no, they haven't.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.774
Great.

19:34.807 --> 19:37.810
I'm telling you something,
if I didn't have a family,

19:37.844 --> 19:40.447
I think I'd be out
buying heroin right now.

19:40.480 --> 19:43.283
Buddy, I don't like to
hear you talking like this.

19:43.316 --> 19:45.752
That's the way I feel.
I mean, why not?

19:46.753 --> 19:48.855
(SIGHS)

19:48.888 --> 19:52.191
Okay. Maybe there's
something that I can do.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.728
Oh, God,
I'm not supposed to do this.

19:55.762 --> 19:57.464
Not supposed
to do what?

19:57.497 --> 19:58.865
You're sounding
so mysterious.

20:01.734 --> 20:04.737
Come on.
Take a walk with me.
I'm going to...

20:04.771 --> 20:08.207
I'm going to tell you
something you're probably
not going to believe.

20:10.843 --> 20:12.812
Do you know
what a Muse is?

20:12.845 --> 20:14.314
A Muse?

20:14.347 --> 20:15.415
Yeah.

20:15.448 --> 20:16.316
I think so.

20:16.349 --> 20:18.351
Well, you know
about mythology, right?

20:18.385 --> 20:20.920
They were
the daughters of Zeus.
There were nine of them.

20:20.953 --> 20:22.722
They inspired
all creativity.

20:22.755 --> 20:26.593
That's... That's where
the word "music" comes from.

20:26.626 --> 20:29.662
That's interesting.
I didn't know that.
What's the point?

20:31.898 --> 20:34.601
What if I told you they...
They still exist?

20:34.634 --> 20:36.536
Muses?

20:36.569 --> 20:38.971
(LAUGHING) I would tell you
I rode over here on a unicorn.

20:39.005 --> 20:40.640
(LAUGHS)

20:40.673 --> 20:43.343
No, I'm...
I'm being dead serious.

20:43.376 --> 20:45.412
I... I want you to listen
to what I have to say

20:45.445 --> 20:47.414
and try to keep
an open mind.

20:48.681 --> 20:51.651
Have a seat.

20:51.684 --> 20:56.489
That... That woman
that you saw this morning
getting into the taxi?

20:56.523 --> 20:57.590
Mmm-hmm.

20:59.526 --> 21:00.993
She's a Muse.

21:01.027 --> 21:02.595
Come on.

21:02.629 --> 21:04.931
No, I met her at a party
a couple of years ago.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.533
Rob Reiner
introduced us.

21:06.566 --> 21:07.867
Rob Reiner?

21:07.900 --> 21:08.935
Yeah, there were
a lot of...

21:08.968 --> 21:11.438
A lot of writers there,
directors...

21:11.471 --> 21:13.573
She... She seemed
to know them all.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.908
I just thank God
that I met her,
because...

21:15.942 --> 21:19.379
If you're lucky enough
to be with her,

21:19.412 --> 21:23.049
you write better
than you've ever written
in your whole life.

21:23.082 --> 21:25.084
You know, I must look
pretty pathetic

21:25.117 --> 21:27.086
that you have to
be soothing me
with this fairy tale.

21:27.119 --> 21:29.656
No, no, no. This is...
This is not a fairy tale.

21:29.689 --> 21:30.923
This is real.

21:30.957 --> 21:32.024
It's real?

21:32.058 --> 21:34.761
You remember
a year and a half ago,

21:34.794 --> 21:36.763
I couldn't break
that hotel story?

21:36.796 --> 21:38.765
Yeah.
Well,
she figured that out.

21:38.798 --> 21:39.966
She wrote it for you?

21:39.999 --> 21:42.735
No, no, she doesn't
actually write.

21:42.769 --> 21:44.036
She inspires.

21:46.105 --> 21:48.107
Where is she from?
Greece?

21:48.140 --> 21:49.676
I don't know
where she's from.

21:49.709 --> 21:54.046
Her family tree apparently
goes all the way back
to the beginning of time.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.615
I never really ask questions.

21:55.648 --> 21:58.385
I've just taken
what she's offered.

22:00.119 --> 22:02.121
You're being serious.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.790
I'm being serious.

22:03.823 --> 22:04.957
You swear to God?

22:04.991 --> 22:06.559
I swear to God.

22:08.828 --> 22:11.130
Okay, I believe you.

22:11.163 --> 22:12.865
I want in.
How do I meet her?

22:12.899 --> 22:15.768
I don't...
I don't know
if I can do that.

22:15.802 --> 22:16.836
Well, you have to do it.

22:16.869 --> 22:18.871
See, she's funny
about taking on
new people.

22:18.905 --> 22:20.673
Well, I'm not new people,
I'm one of your best friends.

22:20.707 --> 22:22.074
You have to call her.
Call her now.

22:22.108 --> 22:23.943
You can't tell me this,
and then not call her.

22:23.976 --> 22:25.878
This is what I need.
This is why I'm here.

22:25.912 --> 22:27.714
I didn't know exactly
why I came.

22:27.747 --> 22:29.482
This is why. Call her.

22:30.817 --> 22:32.051
Please.

22:34.787 --> 22:38.658
And he's really
a good friend.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.960
(STAMMERING)
And he needs you.

22:40.993 --> 22:41.928
(SOFTLY) Tell her
I got nominated.

22:41.961 --> 22:45.164
Oh, he was nominated
for an Academy Award.

22:45.197 --> 22:47.434
Did you see
McAllister Place?

22:47.467 --> 22:48.868
McCormick Place.
McCormick Place?

22:52.872 --> 22:54.707
Well, it was good.
You should see it.

22:54.741 --> 22:56.709
I got the tape.
I have a tape.

22:56.743 --> 22:59.011
Anyway, he's in trouble.

22:59.045 --> 23:01.380
Could you at least
meet with him?

23:04.617 --> 23:06.919
Fantastic.

23:06.953 --> 23:10.022
Fantastic. Sarah, I...
I can't thank you enough.

23:10.056 --> 23:11.558
This is...
This is wonderful.

23:11.591 --> 23:14.427
Oh, and by the way,
you were right once again.

23:14.994 --> 23:17.063
About Toronto.
So much better.

23:18.598 --> 23:20.967
No, no. Than...
No, than Quebec.

23:22.201 --> 23:25.204
Yes, I know.
Too much French.

23:25.237 --> 23:28.207
All right. And, Sarah,
thank you again.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.776
You're a doll.

23:31.110 --> 23:32.645
You're going to
see her today at 4:00.

23:32.679 --> 23:34.981
Oh, my God,
I can't believe it!

23:35.014 --> 23:36.883
You're amazing!
Yeah.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.618
Are you going to Canada?

23:38.651 --> 23:41.788
No, no, no.
No, I'm setting
a movie in Canada.

23:41.821 --> 23:44.591
She convinced me
Toronto was much better
than Quebec.

23:44.624 --> 23:47.560
She does locations, too?
This is a miracle.

23:47.594 --> 23:48.995
It's a miracle.

23:49.028 --> 23:50.763
Now, here's the address.

23:50.797 --> 23:52.532
You saved me.

23:52.565 --> 23:54.133
I don't know
how else to put it.
You saved me.

23:54.166 --> 23:55.702
Hey, all I did was
get you the meeting.

23:55.735 --> 23:56.969
You're going to have to
do the rest.

23:57.003 --> 23:58.705
But I'll tell you this...

23:58.738 --> 24:02.809
You get her,
your life is never
going to be the same.

24:31.871 --> 24:33.640
(DOORBELL RINGING)

24:36.776 --> 24:38.010
Can I help you?

24:38.044 --> 24:40.046
Yes. Is Sarah Little here?

24:40.079 --> 24:41.881
No. She lives
in the guest house.

24:41.914 --> 24:43.282
Ah. Where would that be?

24:43.315 --> 24:45.117
Oh, it's around the back.
It has its own gate.

24:45.151 --> 24:46.218
Oh.

24:46.252 --> 24:47.520
Who are you?

24:47.554 --> 24:48.888
I'm just a friend.

24:48.921 --> 24:49.789
Are you her husband?

24:49.822 --> 24:51.223
Oh, no, no, no.

24:51.257 --> 24:52.659
Well, then, how come
you don't have a gift?

24:52.692 --> 24:54.026
What?

24:54.060 --> 24:57.063
How come you're not
bringing her anything?
Everyone else does.

24:57.096 --> 24:58.731
I don't know anything
about that.

24:58.765 --> 25:00.199
I'm... I'm new.

25:00.232 --> 25:02.234
Well, you better
have a gift.

25:33.065 --> 25:34.300
Yes.

25:34.333 --> 25:37.336
Hello. I'm Steven Phillips.
I'm Jack's friend.

25:37.369 --> 25:40.339
Oh! Oh! I'm sorry.
Something came up
for me today.

25:40.372 --> 25:41.674
I'll have to see you
tomorrow morning.

25:41.708 --> 25:43.042
Tomorrow?

25:43.075 --> 25:45.011
Did you bring any
of your scripts with you?

25:45.044 --> 25:46.312
No, I didn't know
I was supposed to.

25:46.345 --> 25:48.280
Have someone messenger over
some of your work.

25:48.314 --> 25:50.983
I'll read it tonight.
I'll see you tomorrow
at 10:30. Okay?

25:51.017 --> 25:53.085
So, then, that's the end
of this meeting?

25:53.119 --> 25:56.155
Was there
something else you wanted?

25:56.188 --> 25:58.224
(STAMMERING)
How did this go? Okay?

25:58.257 --> 26:00.159
(CHUCKLING)
Yeah, went fine.

26:02.962 --> 26:04.864
STEVEN: So, she couldn't
really see me.

26:04.897 --> 26:06.699
She wants me to send over
some of my work

26:06.733 --> 26:08.635
and come back
in the morning.

26:08.668 --> 26:10.002
JACK: Ah, did you
bring her a gift?

26:10.036 --> 26:11.270
STEVEN ON PHONE: What?

26:11.303 --> 26:13.272
Oh, I hope you didn't go
empty-handed.

26:13.305 --> 26:15.174
Well, you didn't say
anything about this.

26:15.207 --> 26:18.010
Listen to me,
go to Tiffany's right now.

26:18.044 --> 26:19.345
Bring her something.

26:19.378 --> 26:23.049
Tiffany's?
I don't shop for my wife
at Tiffany's.

26:23.082 --> 26:26.352
Your wife can't
save your career.
Do what I'm telling you.

26:26.385 --> 26:28.821
Well, what's her taste?
How much money
do I have to spend?

26:28.855 --> 26:30.122
Get her something very...

26:30.156 --> 26:31.223
(STATIC)

26:31.257 --> 26:33.092
Hello...
Hello?

26:33.125 --> 26:34.160
I'm losing you.

26:34.193 --> 26:35.261
Can't hear you.

26:35.294 --> 26:36.395
Hello?

26:36.428 --> 26:37.697
Hello?

26:37.730 --> 26:38.998
How much
do I have to spend?

26:39.031 --> 26:40.199
Good luck, buddy.

26:40.232 --> 26:41.801
How much money?

26:45.772 --> 26:47.173
Is that Steven?

26:48.007 --> 26:49.742
Phyllis.

26:49.776 --> 26:51.678
Hi.
How are you?

26:51.711 --> 26:52.845
What are you buying?

26:52.879 --> 26:54.714
Well, it's a secret.

26:55.682 --> 26:56.883
Does Laura know?

26:56.916 --> 26:58.951
No. That's what
a secret means.

26:59.819 --> 27:00.920
Is it her birthday?

27:00.953 --> 27:01.988
No.

27:02.021 --> 27:03.690
Special occasion?

27:03.723 --> 27:04.857
Uh-uh.

27:04.891 --> 27:06.425
I wish Frank was like you.

27:06.458 --> 27:07.694
(LAUGHS)

27:09.261 --> 27:10.396
Since you don't
really know this woman,

27:10.429 --> 27:12.098
you can't go wrong
with one of these.

27:12.131 --> 27:15.401
Everyone loves them.

27:15.434 --> 27:18.938
(STAMMERING) Well,
I'll leave you and
your little shopping dilemma.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.439
This is not
what you think.

27:20.472 --> 27:24.243
I don't think anything.
Bye-bye.

27:24.276 --> 27:27.313
Phyllis, it's just
a business gift.
That's all this is.

27:27.346 --> 27:28.715
My lips are sealed.

27:28.748 --> 27:30.817
Your lips don't
have to be sealed.

27:30.850 --> 27:33.786
It's not a lip-sealing
situation, Phyllis.

27:33.820 --> 27:35.722
Unseal them!

27:35.755 --> 27:38.024
Let your lips just do
what they do.

27:39.291 --> 27:40.860
(SIGHS)

27:40.893 --> 27:43.362
Let's see.
They're all pretty.

27:43.395 --> 27:45.732
How much would this be?

27:45.765 --> 27:47.066
That one is $3,500.

27:47.099 --> 27:49.802
Oh, God, no.
No, no, no, no.

27:49.836 --> 27:55.742
No. I was thinking
more like 50, 60.

27:55.775 --> 27:57.043
Sixty what?

27:57.076 --> 27:58.277
Dollars.

27:58.310 --> 28:01.080
Oh, I see.

28:01.113 --> 28:07.153
Well, these sterling
silver key rings are $60.

28:07.186 --> 28:09.255
Oh, well,
that's beautiful.

28:10.289 --> 28:12.892
It's feminine and pretty.

28:12.925 --> 28:16.028
And what woman
wouldn't love this?

28:16.062 --> 28:17.463
Does this come
with a Tiffany box?

28:17.496 --> 28:18.865
Yes, it does.

28:18.898 --> 28:20.199
Wrap that up.
Okay.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.068
Who is she?

28:22.101 --> 28:23.736
STEVEN: She's nobody.

28:23.770 --> 28:25.404
You were at Tiffany's
for nobody?

28:25.437 --> 28:27.373
Phyllis doesn't know
anything.

28:27.406 --> 28:28.841
If I told you
what I was doing there,

28:28.875 --> 28:30.109
you're not going to
believe me anyway.

28:30.142 --> 28:33.245
So, just forget it for now.
I'll tell you later.

28:33.279 --> 28:34.814
Are you in love
with someone?

28:34.847 --> 28:37.183
Yes. You.

28:37.216 --> 28:38.951
Well, then,
why didn't you
buy me a present?

28:38.985 --> 28:40.119
How do you know
I didn't?

28:40.152 --> 28:41.788
Did you?

28:41.821 --> 28:43.155
Well, not today.

28:43.189 --> 28:45.024
Oh, this makes me
feel weird.

28:45.057 --> 28:47.293
I don't like
hearing these things
from my friends.

28:47.326 --> 28:50.029
She's not your friend.
She's a big, fat gossip.

28:50.062 --> 28:51.130
Well, what did you buy?

28:51.163 --> 28:53.199
I bought a little key ring,
that's all.

28:53.232 --> 28:54.200
Just a nothing.
A key ring.

28:54.233 --> 28:56.803
Well, why did you
have to buy it
at Tiffany's?

28:56.836 --> 28:59.271
Do me a favor.
Give me 24 hours.

28:59.305 --> 29:00.940
Let me figure
this all out,

29:00.973 --> 29:02.208
then I can
explain it to you.

29:02.241 --> 29:05.311
It's just they...
They told me not to say
too much right now.

29:05.344 --> 29:06.512
Who's "they"?

29:06.545 --> 29:07.880
Please, no questions.

29:07.914 --> 29:09.515
Just give me a hint.

29:09.548 --> 29:11.517
Okay. One hint.

29:12.985 --> 29:15.888
It's mystical.
It's magical.

29:16.522 --> 29:18.858
It just might save my life.

29:18.891 --> 29:20.292
And it wanted a key ring?

29:20.326 --> 29:21.527
Yes, it did.

29:29.201 --> 29:32.038
Hello. Here.

29:32.071 --> 29:33.172
Come on in.
Thank you.

29:33.205 --> 29:34.173
Okay.

29:35.407 --> 29:36.575
(DOOR CLOSES)

29:36.608 --> 29:38.310
Come in. Sit down.

29:42.348 --> 29:44.083
Gee, now that
I've seen your taste,

29:44.116 --> 29:45.051
I don't think I got you
the right gift.

29:45.084 --> 29:46.252
Oh, it's fine.

29:46.285 --> 29:47.419
STEVEN: No, no, no,
it isn't fine.

29:47.453 --> 29:48.855
SARAH: No,
it's lovely, I'm sure.

29:48.888 --> 29:50.289
(STAMMERING) I'm just...
I'm a little worried

29:50.322 --> 29:51.824
because I see
what you like and...

29:51.858 --> 29:53.359
Forget about it.

29:53.392 --> 29:54.493
All right.

29:54.526 --> 29:55.895
I read two of
your scripts.

29:55.928 --> 29:57.529
Yes.

29:57.563 --> 29:59.231
I can see why
you need me.

29:59.265 --> 30:00.599
Oh, well, that doesn't
sound very good,
does it?

30:00.632 --> 30:02.068
Oh, don't be offended.

30:02.101 --> 30:05.504
You have a...
A lot of talent.

30:05.537 --> 30:08.074
It's just that
you're losing your edge.

30:08.107 --> 30:10.576
Jesus!
I'm hearing this
from everybody.

30:10.609 --> 30:13.880
That's because it's true.
But I have good news for you.

30:14.646 --> 30:16.448
I'm taking you on.

30:16.482 --> 30:18.317
Really?

30:18.350 --> 30:20.352
So, I've got a Muse.
I've got my own Muse!

30:20.386 --> 30:22.621
First, I'm going to need
somewhere to live.

30:22.654 --> 30:26.092
Try getting me
a very nice suite at
the Four Seasons Hotel.

30:26.125 --> 30:27.994
Something on a high floor.

30:28.027 --> 30:29.896
It's much quieter
that way.

30:29.929 --> 30:30.863
Now, secondly,
I have special...

30:30.897 --> 30:34.000
Wait, wait. Let's just
go to the "firstly."

30:34.033 --> 30:36.936
You want what?
A suite at the Four Seasons?

30:36.969 --> 30:39.438
Yes.
On a higher floor, please.

30:39.471 --> 30:41.540
Well, what's wrong
with this place?
It's lovely.

30:41.573 --> 30:45.377
Oh, it's a guest house,
and I've already told them
that I'm leaving.

30:45.411 --> 30:46.612
You see,
the way I work is,

30:46.645 --> 30:48.514
my new client takes on
all my expenses.

30:48.547 --> 30:50.917
And, well,
you're my new client.

30:52.518 --> 30:54.020
I am?
Mmm.

30:54.053 --> 30:55.988
Am I the only new client?

30:56.022 --> 30:57.323
Yes.

30:57.356 --> 30:59.225
I mean, Jack, for example,
he's not a new client?

30:59.258 --> 31:00.726
No.

31:00.759 --> 31:03.329
So, then, like, Jack is
not going to be kicking in
for the suite here?

31:03.362 --> 31:04.496
No, he wouldn't.

31:04.530 --> 31:07.199
Okay, then.
Gee. Whoa!

31:07.233 --> 31:08.667
Secondarily...

31:08.700 --> 31:10.569
I just, you know,
it's a new piece
of information.

31:10.602 --> 31:12.504
I have special
dietary needs.

31:12.538 --> 31:14.573
I assume that the suite
will have a kitchenette.

31:14.606 --> 31:16.008
I'll need you
to fill that with food.

31:16.042 --> 31:17.276
A concise list will follow.
Will follow.

31:20.980 --> 31:22.949
You're not
writing this down.

31:22.982 --> 31:25.651
You want me to
write it down?

31:25.684 --> 31:26.685
Nobody said anything.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.154
Well...

31:28.187 --> 31:30.089
(MUTTERING)

31:30.122 --> 31:32.691
I have a small piece
of paper here.

31:32.724 --> 31:34.693
I don't... I don't...

31:34.726 --> 31:35.962
Oh.

31:35.995 --> 31:37.596
Uh...
What?

31:37.629 --> 31:38.464
Oh.

31:41.567 --> 31:43.069
(SIGHS)

31:46.505 --> 31:49.175
Okay. A suite.

31:51.443 --> 31:53.279
You said the high floor?
Mmm-hmm.

31:53.312 --> 31:55.247
So, I'm assuming
something above eight
would be sufficient?

31:55.281 --> 31:56.282
(CHUCKLING)
Oh, no!

31:57.616 --> 31:58.650
All right.

31:58.684 --> 32:00.552
And the dietary needs?

32:03.455 --> 32:07.226
How long will this
musing process take?

32:07.659 --> 32:10.062
More than a day?

32:10.096 --> 32:14.600
Inspiration
can take a week
to six months.

32:14.633 --> 32:15.667
That depends on you.

32:15.701 --> 32:17.436
Six months?

32:17.469 --> 32:19.405
You don't want to...
You don't want to...

32:19.438 --> 32:22.341
You don't want to be
in the Four Seasons
for six months.

32:22.374 --> 32:23.242
(STAMMERING)
That's not good.

32:23.275 --> 32:24.510
Why not?

32:24.543 --> 32:26.445
Well, a lot of reasons.

32:26.478 --> 32:28.080
First of all,
it's too high.

32:28.114 --> 32:29.381
I'll be fine.

32:29.415 --> 32:30.749
Well, maybe high
isn't what I meant.

32:30.782 --> 32:32.084
You're concerned
about the cost, correct?

32:32.118 --> 32:35.187
No, no, no.
Yeah. Yeah.

32:35.221 --> 32:37.389
If this process works
and you sell this script,

32:37.423 --> 32:39.391
you're going to make
a lot of money.

32:39.425 --> 32:41.460
You need to think of this
as an investment.

32:45.064 --> 32:46.398
I'll write that down.

32:46.432 --> 32:47.599
And transportation.

32:47.633 --> 32:49.135
Transportation.

32:49.168 --> 32:50.269
A limousine.

32:50.302 --> 32:52.004
What?
Lim-ou-sine.

32:52.038 --> 32:53.105
Oh, you don't need that.

32:53.139 --> 32:55.074
Yes, yes, yes, I do.

32:55.107 --> 32:57.076
Well, I mean, I'm happy
to drive you wherever
you want to go.

32:57.109 --> 32:58.444
You really
don't need a limo.

32:58.477 --> 33:01.247
(LAUGHING)
What if I need something
in the middle of the night?

33:01.280 --> 33:04.050
Well, I mean, the Four
Seasons has a concierge,
and I'm available.

33:04.083 --> 33:06.318
You're covered.
One person or another,
you're gonna be all right.

33:06.352 --> 33:08.654
I am used
to having
my own car.

33:08.687 --> 33:10.556
How about if I make
a deal with you?

33:10.589 --> 33:13.159
You get me one of those
Oscars that you got Jack,

33:13.192 --> 33:15.361
and I'll drive you
to the moon.

33:15.394 --> 33:17.296
I mean, I'll be on call
24 hours a day.

33:18.530 --> 33:20.266
All right.
We'll try it your way.

33:20.299 --> 33:24.170
All right. At least that.
No limo.

33:24.203 --> 33:27.039
Now, in terms of working,
we'll work at my hours.

33:27.073 --> 33:28.640
Sometimes,
if I'm up in the
middle of the night

33:28.674 --> 33:31.043
and I can't sleep
and I feel productive,

33:31.077 --> 33:32.278
I'm gonna expect
you to work.

33:33.712 --> 33:35.614
Do you actually do
some of the writing?

33:35.647 --> 33:37.449
No.

33:37.483 --> 33:39.551
So, it's not like
Rumpelstiltskin.

33:39.585 --> 33:41.520
I'm not gonna wake up
with a script?

33:41.553 --> 33:43.755
No, you won't wake up
with a script.

33:43.789 --> 33:45.557
(SIGHING) All right.

33:45.591 --> 33:48.360
Now, I need you to go
to the Four Seasons today

33:48.394 --> 33:49.828
to make sure that
you like the suite

33:49.861 --> 33:52.131
because I'll wanna
move tomorrow.

33:52.164 --> 33:54.600
So, on your way
over to the hotel,

33:54.633 --> 33:58.770
take these to the Royal
Cleaners on Canon Drive

33:58.804 --> 34:01.707
and make sure that
they're dry-cleaned.

34:01.740 --> 34:05.311
Because if you don't
specify dry-cleaning,
they'll wash them.

34:06.612 --> 34:07.746
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

34:14.620 --> 34:16.222
Hello.

34:16.255 --> 34:17.556
Daddy said,
"Thank you."

34:17.589 --> 34:19.358
And he wanted me
to give you this.

34:19.391 --> 34:22.561
Well, you tell
your dad I said,
"Thank you very much."

34:22.594 --> 34:23.661
Okay.

34:23.695 --> 34:25.297
Okay. Bye, honey.

34:25.331 --> 34:26.232
(LAUGHING)

34:29.701 --> 34:30.636
(SIGHING)

34:33.339 --> 34:34.406
Hmm.

34:36.308 --> 34:39.178
Holy shit,
did I give you
the wrong gift.

34:39.210 --> 34:40.812
You're not gonna like it.

34:40.846 --> 34:42.648
My gift is not ready.

34:42.681 --> 34:45.650
This is just like
a little temporary pre-gift.

34:45.684 --> 34:47.786
The real gift
is being built.

34:47.819 --> 34:51.422
It wasn't what I wanted,
they convinced me
and I told them no.

34:51.456 --> 34:53.792
So, I'm going to go
and get what
I really wanted.

34:53.824 --> 34:56.228
You would clog up
your toilet trying
to flush this.

34:56.262 --> 34:57.496
This is dreck.

34:58.830 --> 35:00.399
Do you have your list?

35:40.272 --> 35:41.607
Okay.

35:44.943 --> 35:48.514
Why don't you
get settled?

35:48.547 --> 35:51.417
I'm going to run down
to the lobby
for one minute.

35:53.619 --> 35:54.620
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

35:59.358 --> 36:02.261
Hi, again.
I'm back.

36:03.595 --> 36:05.831
If she's here more
than three days,

36:05.864 --> 36:08.567
doesn't a discount
kick in then?

36:08.600 --> 36:11.503
Nothing is going
to kick in, sir.
I've told you this.

36:11.537 --> 36:13.672
No, I know.
But say you're
a resident.

36:13.705 --> 36:15.707
I'm sure you got people
who live in the hotel.

36:15.741 --> 36:17.376
They get a discount,
don't they?

36:17.409 --> 36:18.744
She's not a resident.

36:18.777 --> 36:20.612
Well, how many days
qualifies as a resident?

36:20.646 --> 36:21.947
More than 30.

36:21.980 --> 36:25.917
Look, I'll tell you what.
Come to me in a month.
We'll talk.

36:25.951 --> 36:29.621
All right.
One last thing.

36:29.655 --> 36:33.492
For 1,700 a day,
shouldn't you fill up
the refrigerator?

36:33.525 --> 36:35.994
It just seems odd
that I have to do that.

36:36.027 --> 36:37.496
Why don't you
fill it up with food?

36:38.564 --> 36:39.498
Are you joking?

36:40.532 --> 36:41.600
Are we laughing?

36:43.335 --> 36:46.505
You're an
interesting man, sir.
Please leave.

36:56.582 --> 36:57.583
SARAH: Psst.

37:01.587 --> 37:02.688
(WHISPERING)
Tip him.

37:02.721 --> 37:03.789
You didn't
tip him yet?

37:03.822 --> 37:04.956
I don't tip.

37:04.990 --> 37:06.525
He's been standing here
the whole time?

37:06.558 --> 37:07.559
Just do it.

37:07.593 --> 37:08.894
(SIGHING)

37:10.362 --> 37:11.430
Here you go.

37:12.698 --> 37:14.366
Thanks.
Thank you.

37:18.304 --> 37:19.271
So, what did
you give him?

37:19.305 --> 37:20.406
Ten dollars.

37:20.439 --> 37:21.973
(SCOFFING)
That's not enough!

37:22.007 --> 37:24.776
You've got to give
them at least 20
or they feel slighted.

37:24.810 --> 37:26.812
Well, what should I do?
Run after him
and give him more money?

37:26.845 --> 37:29.281
No, you can do it
next time.

37:29.315 --> 37:31.350
Right. I'll get him
the next time.

37:31.950 --> 37:33.585
So, what do we think?

37:33.619 --> 37:35.287
SARAH: Meh.

37:35.321 --> 37:37.556
The suite's nice.
It's just that...
You know.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.391
(WHISPERING)
It's over the pool.

37:39.425 --> 37:42.428
(SCOFFS)
This is where you want
to be in this hotel.

37:42.461 --> 37:45.531
This is the premium side,
the pool side.

37:45.564 --> 37:48.600
The street's the bad side.
The pool's the good side.

37:48.634 --> 37:50.336
This is 1,700 a night.

37:50.369 --> 37:52.604
Don't talk about prices.

37:52.638 --> 37:54.706
I have many important
things on my mind.

37:54.740 --> 37:57.042
I don't have room
for thoughts of money.

37:57.075 --> 37:58.444
Why would you?

37:58.477 --> 38:01.480
Now, we need to do
some grocery shopping.

38:01.513 --> 38:02.448
You know,
I don't know you that well.

38:02.481 --> 38:04.650
But just so I understand
the way you talk,

38:04.683 --> 38:07.486
when you say "we,"
you mean me.

38:07.519 --> 38:09.054
Yeah.

38:09.087 --> 38:10.922
You

38:10.956 --> 38:12.591
need to get
some groceries.
There's my list.

38:13.992 --> 38:15.694
Oh.

38:15.727 --> 38:17.463
And please go
to the health food store

38:17.496 --> 38:19.731
because I don't like
the other kind.

38:19.765 --> 38:21.500
You know what?
I psychically knew that.

38:43.455 --> 38:45.791
(GASPS)
Hi, Daddy!
Look! Daddy's here.

38:46.592 --> 38:47.459
Yes.

38:48.093 --> 38:49.895
Hi.

38:49.928 --> 38:52.731
Honey,
go get some soda.

38:52.764 --> 38:53.765
I want to talk
to your father.

38:53.799 --> 38:54.900
What kind of soda?

38:54.933 --> 38:56.001
Any kind you want.

38:56.034 --> 38:57.803
Oh, boy!

38:57.836 --> 38:59.104
Hi.
How are you?

38:59.137 --> 39:00.572
What are you doing here?

39:00.606 --> 39:01.607
I'm shopping.

39:02.508 --> 39:04.510
You're shopping?
Yeah.

39:04.543 --> 39:06.812
You're shopping for us.

39:06.845 --> 39:08.880
I was hungry.
There wasn't really
anything in the house.

39:08.914 --> 39:11.116
So I thought
I would help out.

39:13.452 --> 39:14.720
Who eats these?

39:14.753 --> 39:16.121
The snails? I do.

39:16.154 --> 39:17.355
Since when?

39:17.389 --> 39:20.091
Well, there's a lot
of things you
don't know about me.

39:20.125 --> 39:22.360
Like your need
for tampons.

39:24.029 --> 39:26.598
I'm shopping for her. Okay?

39:26.632 --> 39:29.535
I was going to tell you
about it if it went well,
which it did.

39:29.568 --> 39:31.703
I'm gonna be working
with this woman now,
and I just...

39:31.737 --> 39:33.572
I had to pick up
a few things for her.
That's all.

39:33.605 --> 39:36.107
Who the hell are you
working with that makes
you go shopping?

39:36.141 --> 39:37.275
I don't get it.

39:37.308 --> 39:39.711
Well, she lives in a hotel
and she doesn't have a car.

39:39.745 --> 39:42.180
In a hotel? What hotel?

39:42.213 --> 39:43.849
She's at the
Four Seasons.

39:43.882 --> 39:45.751
Why is she there?

39:45.784 --> 39:47.519
That's where I put her.

39:47.553 --> 39:48.954
You put someone up
at the Four Seasons hotel?

39:48.987 --> 39:51.457
Those rooms cost a fortune!

39:51.490 --> 39:53.992
Listen, we can talk about it,
but we don't wanna discuss
it in the market, do we?

39:54.025 --> 39:55.594
Let's talk about it at home.

39:55.627 --> 39:57.162
Who the hell
is this person?
Tell me right now.

39:57.195 --> 39:58.997
I may not see you at home.

39:59.030 --> 39:59.965
What are you threatening?

39:59.998 --> 40:01.700
Who is she?

40:02.233 --> 40:03.502
She's a Muse.

40:06.137 --> 40:08.073
I don't think
I heard you.

40:08.106 --> 40:12.077
She's a Muse.
A real, live Muse.

40:12.110 --> 40:14.680
That's who eats snails?
The Muse?

40:14.713 --> 40:15.781
Yes.

40:15.814 --> 40:16.948
I'll see you later.

40:16.982 --> 40:19.885
Something is wrong with you.
I am really quite worried.

40:19.918 --> 40:22.020
Listen to me,
Laura, honey, trust me.

40:22.053 --> 40:24.823
I don't say that
unless I mean it.
Trust me.

40:24.856 --> 40:27.092
Just buy the snails
and the tampons.
I'll talk to you later.

40:27.125 --> 40:30.462
I swear to God
I'm telling the truth!
Ask Jack!

40:30.496 --> 40:34.666
She's a real Muse!
She's not the only one!

40:34.700 --> 40:36.434
They live amongst us!

40:37.035 --> 40:39.237
Let's go.
He's crazy.

40:39.270 --> 40:40.806
What did Carl say
when he left you?

40:40.839 --> 40:44.610
SUSAN ON PHONE:
He didn't say anything.
I found a note.

40:44.643 --> 40:47.646
I'm so confused.
I thought everything
was okay with us.

40:47.679 --> 40:49.748
Well, what if he's
telling you the truth?

40:49.781 --> 40:53.251
The truth?
That he met a Muse?
Are you crazy?

40:53.284 --> 40:55.554
Hey, I have an idea.
Follow him.

40:55.587 --> 40:57.589
I'm not going
to follow him.

40:57.623 --> 40:59.024
I'm just disappointed
on so many levels.

40:59.057 --> 41:01.092
Maybe he really
has lost it.

41:01.126 --> 41:03.862
You would think as a writer
he would come up with
a better excuse than this.

41:03.895 --> 41:07.065
Yeah. I don't know.
I guess it does sound
a little weird.

41:07.098 --> 41:09.668
I'm too upset right now.
I'll talk to you later.

41:09.701 --> 41:11.903
Okay. Well, take care
of yourself. All right?

41:13.138 --> 41:14.139
(SIGHING)

41:14.172 --> 41:18.577
Mommy? Are you
and Daddy getting
a divorce?

41:18.610 --> 41:20.612
What? No!

41:20.646 --> 41:23.048
No, honey,
of course not.

41:23.081 --> 41:24.516
What's going on?

41:24.550 --> 41:26.918
I don't know.
Maybe nothing.

41:26.952 --> 41:29.588
Daddy's just a little
confused right now.

41:29.621 --> 41:31.022
Has Daddy lost it?

41:31.056 --> 41:32.824
No. Why do you say that?

41:32.858 --> 41:35.193
My friend Karen
says that all writers
lose it eventually.

41:35.226 --> 41:37.663
That's why they
kill themselves.

41:37.696 --> 41:39.765
That's not true.
And they don't
kill themselves.

41:39.798 --> 41:41.132
Margaux Hemingway did.

41:41.166 --> 41:42.968
You're thinking
of Ernest Hemingway.

41:43.001 --> 41:44.870
So did Margaux Hemingway.

41:44.903 --> 41:46.838
We're not the Hemingways.

41:46.872 --> 41:49.808
If you and Daddy split up,
can I get my own apartment?

41:49.841 --> 41:52.611
First of all,
we're not splitting up.
Second of all, you're 12.

41:52.644 --> 41:53.912
You're not getting
your own apartment.

41:53.945 --> 41:55.280
My friend Sandy did.

41:55.313 --> 41:57.015
Sandy's parents
are in the mob.

41:57.048 --> 41:58.617
I don't want to talk
about it anymore.

41:59.885 --> 42:01.152
So Jack's known her
for a year?

42:01.186 --> 42:02.988
Longer than that.

42:03.021 --> 42:05.190
And he says she's real?

42:05.223 --> 42:09.094
Since he's met her,
he's had the best period
of his entire life.

42:09.127 --> 42:11.563
He got the Oscar,
for God's sake!

42:11.597 --> 42:12.698
And other writers
know her?

42:12.731 --> 42:14.165
Yes, tons!

42:14.199 --> 42:16.101
(PHONE RINGING)

42:16.134 --> 42:17.703
Who could be
calling this late?

42:17.736 --> 42:19.304
Oh, God!
I hope nobody died.

42:20.672 --> 42:21.707
Hello?

42:21.740 --> 42:23.041
Steven?

42:23.074 --> 42:26.211
It's okay.
What's wrong?

42:26.244 --> 42:29.114
I don't like
the room service here.

42:29.147 --> 42:32.183
STEVEN: How could that be?
You're at the Four Seasons.

42:32.217 --> 42:34.753
(CRYING)
I want a Waldorf salad.

42:34.786 --> 42:37.122
So order one.

42:37.155 --> 42:39.691
(SNIFFLING)
But they won't
make it after 10:00.

42:39.725 --> 42:41.793
All right.
Calm down.
Take it easy.

42:42.828 --> 42:44.863
There's a reason for that.

42:44.896 --> 42:46.331
I just read
in the newspaper

42:46.364 --> 42:49.034
where it's unhealthy
to eat lettuce
in the evening.

42:49.067 --> 42:50.969
They did this
study at Harvard,

42:51.002 --> 42:57.075
and anybody who had
any kind of greens after 8:00
had a lot of colon problems.

42:57.108 --> 42:59.110
You don't want colon
problems, do you?

42:59.144 --> 43:00.946
(LAUGHING HUMORLESSLY)
I want the salad.

43:01.379 --> 43:02.280
Damn it.

43:03.248 --> 43:05.917
It's her.
She wants a salad.

43:05.951 --> 43:07.018
Oh.

43:08.754 --> 43:11.890
Listen, you know,
nothing's open now.
It's too late.

43:11.923 --> 43:13.692
Spago is open.

43:13.725 --> 43:18.129
Spago? Are you sure
Spago even makes
a Waldorf salad?

43:18.163 --> 43:20.899
(SIGHING)
Maybe we made
a mistake.

43:20.932 --> 43:22.000
STEVEN: What?

43:22.033 --> 43:23.869
Maybe you and I
shouldn't work together.

43:23.902 --> 43:27.138
Why? Because
I'm questioning
your order?

43:27.172 --> 43:29.340
Just make sure
they don't put
any cheese on it.

43:29.374 --> 43:30.408
Are you writing
this down?

43:30.441 --> 43:33.278
Yes, I'm always
writing it down.

43:35.814 --> 43:39.017
No cheese.

43:39.050 --> 43:42.020
Also, stop at the drug store
and get me bobby pins.

43:42.053 --> 43:43.288
Bobby pins?

43:43.321 --> 43:44.222
See you soon.

43:47.325 --> 43:51.196
You know what?
I'm starting
to believe you.

43:51.229 --> 43:52.397
I don't know
who this woman is,

43:52.430 --> 43:54.866
but at least I know
you're not having
sex with her.

43:54.900 --> 43:56.334
Why?

43:56.367 --> 43:57.368
Because you could
never get aroused

43:57.402 --> 43:59.304
by someone who made you
do this many errands.

44:07.713 --> 44:09.848
WOMAN ON RADIO:
He's carrying a salad.
I think he's on 15.

44:09.881 --> 44:10.916
May I help you, sir?

44:12.317 --> 44:14.119
I'm going to 1515.

44:14.152 --> 44:15.854
Are you a guest, sir?

44:15.887 --> 44:18.223
No, I'm feeding
a guest.

44:30.435 --> 44:31.770
Oh.

44:32.237 --> 44:34.305
One Waldorf.

44:34.339 --> 44:36.141
Call me tomorrow.
I'm sleeping.

44:36.174 --> 44:37.809
Well, what about this?

44:37.843 --> 44:39.010
You eat it.

44:39.044 --> 44:40.211
I don't want it.

44:40.245 --> 44:42.247
Well, give it
to the homeless.

44:42.280 --> 44:43.849
Oh, that's a swell idea.

44:43.882 --> 44:45.450
They can eat it
with the bobby pins.

44:45.483 --> 44:48.987
Oh, I forgot
the bobby pins.
Call me tomorrow.

44:49.020 --> 44:50.388
I have a question.

44:50.421 --> 44:52.123
WOMAN: Get some
identification, Bob.

44:53.058 --> 44:54.192
(STEVEN EXCLAIMING)

44:54.225 --> 44:55.727
(SIGHING)
I'm sorry, sir.

44:55.761 --> 44:56.962
STEVEN: Ow.

44:56.995 --> 44:58.329
Are you all right?

44:58.363 --> 44:59.430
I'm fine.

45:02.868 --> 45:04.269
(PHONE RINGING)

45:15.446 --> 45:16.381
Hello.

45:16.414 --> 45:18.016
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
Good morning!

45:18.049 --> 45:19.150
What?

45:19.184 --> 45:21.887
It's 10:00.
Let's go to Long Beach.

45:21.920 --> 45:23.354
Long Beach?

45:23.388 --> 45:26.925
I was reading about
this new aquarium
and it looks really beautiful.

45:26.958 --> 45:29.094
Let's go check it out.

45:29.127 --> 45:30.195
Aquarium?

45:30.228 --> 45:33.031
Just pick me up.

45:33.064 --> 45:35.967
Can we go a little later
'cause I didn't get
to sleep... Hello?

45:37.368 --> 45:38.469
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

45:42.073 --> 45:43.875
STEVEN: So why this place?

45:43.909 --> 45:45.844
SARAH: I saw an ad,
then I had a dream.

45:45.877 --> 45:48.113
I have a good
feeling about this.

45:48.146 --> 45:49.848
Should I be thinking
of an idea right now?

45:49.881 --> 45:52.183
Quiet.
Just enjoy yourself.

45:52.217 --> 45:53.819
Take it all in.

45:53.852 --> 45:54.920
All right.

45:54.953 --> 45:57.155
Just try to have
some fun today.

45:57.188 --> 45:59.357
I'll going to try
to have a little fun.

46:30.621 --> 46:31.957
You know something?

46:31.990 --> 46:36.127
I don't think I've ever
seen a good movie shot
in a place like this.

46:36.161 --> 46:37.528
I mean, there were
those Willy movies,

46:37.562 --> 46:39.597
but I don't think
they shot them here anyway.

46:39.630 --> 46:41.199
I never saw them.

46:41.232 --> 46:43.068
I'm telling you,
there's never been
a great movie

46:43.101 --> 46:45.937
in this kind of a location.

46:45.971 --> 46:48.940
Doesn't this just lend
itself to one of those
big summer comedies?

46:48.974 --> 46:50.341
It just feels like it,
doesn't it?

46:50.375 --> 46:51.609
It does to me.

46:51.642 --> 46:55.413
I mean, imagine
Jim Carrey working
in a place like this.

46:55.446 --> 46:58.316
That sounds funny
already. Jim Carrey
and all these fish. Right?

46:58.349 --> 47:00.385
Oh, I just love Jim Carrey.

47:00.418 --> 47:02.620
The Truman Show,
I'm particularly proud of.

47:02.653 --> 47:04.055
What?

47:05.123 --> 47:06.391
(WHISPERING)
I can't talk about it.

47:06.424 --> 47:09.094
It just slipped out,
you know.

47:10.095 --> 47:12.230
You did The Truman Show?

47:12.263 --> 47:16.201
(WHISPERING)
I can't really talk about it.
Just erase it from your mind.

47:18.937 --> 47:20.471
Huh?

47:20.505 --> 47:23.008
Well, I think
you should put
the Queen Mary in.

47:23.041 --> 47:26.344
Because it's great
production value
and it's good luck.

47:26.377 --> 47:28.246
Really?
Well, the boat thing
has been big.

47:29.014 --> 47:31.316

Hey! Hi.
It's so good to see you!

47:43.528 --> 47:47.032
Hey. Hi, cutie.
How are you?

47:47.065 --> 47:48.133
Good.

47:48.166 --> 47:49.534
It's so nice
to see you.

47:49.567 --> 47:51.669
Oh, nice
to see you, too.

47:51.702 --> 47:53.571
Oh, God. Thank you
so much for
The American President.

47:53.604 --> 47:54.973
I just never...

47:55.006 --> 47:56.374
Oh, no!

47:56.407 --> 47:57.542
Really, I feel
like I just never...

47:57.575 --> 47:59.144
Come on. Yes.

47:59.177 --> 48:00.411
No, you just... Oh.

48:00.445 --> 48:03.681
Well, come on.
Yeah. Thank you so much.

48:03.714 --> 48:04.682
Well... Oh, you.

48:04.715 --> 48:06.051
Bye.

48:08.954 --> 48:10.121
Was that Rob Reiner?

48:10.155 --> 48:13.191
Yeah. I'm just
crazy about him.

48:13.224 --> 48:14.325
How long have
you known him?

48:14.359 --> 48:16.094
Oh, that's confidential.

48:18.029 --> 48:20.966
So, we're there
for, like, 30 minutes,
and it hits me.

48:20.999 --> 48:23.001
This could be
the biggest idea
for a summer comedy

48:23.034 --> 48:24.469
anybody's ever had!

48:24.502 --> 48:26.972
I love it!
What's the basic idea?

48:27.005 --> 48:29.640
Well, it's not formulated yet,
but here's what I'm thinking.

48:29.674 --> 48:31.476
Say, Jim Carrey, okay?

48:31.509 --> 48:34.946
He inherits
this aquarium from,
like, a rich uncle.

48:34.980 --> 48:38.683
You know, at the...
You open up the movie
with a funeral scene,

48:38.716 --> 48:40.418
and then they're
reading the will,

48:40.451 --> 48:43.221
and all of a sudden,
he owns this aquarium.

48:43.254 --> 48:45.356
(LAUGHING)
And from day one,
it's problems.

48:45.390 --> 48:48.693
I mean,
there's bill collectors
and he hires bad people

48:48.726 --> 48:51.029
and the tanks leak.

48:51.062 --> 48:54.032
I mean, one thing
after another.
It's just, like, a mess.

48:54.065 --> 48:56.234
Oh, this is wonderful.
This was her idea?

48:56.267 --> 48:58.970
No, it was my idea.
It's all my idea.

48:59.004 --> 49:01.572
You know,
she doesn't write,
she just inspires.

49:01.606 --> 49:03.608
She sort of points you
in the right direction.

49:03.641 --> 49:05.176
I love this direction.

49:05.210 --> 49:06.344
You know, I've been
trying to figure out

49:06.377 --> 49:08.479
how to write one
of these summer
comedies forever.

49:08.513 --> 49:10.015
I think I've got it.

49:10.048 --> 49:11.216
Jim Carrey would
be hysterical.

49:11.249 --> 49:12.317
Wouldn't he?

49:12.350 --> 49:13.718
Jim Carrey was her idea?

49:13.751 --> 49:17.588
My idea.
It's all my idea. Me.

49:17.622 --> 49:21.459
Well, you sure seem
inspired, and that's
all that matters.

49:21.492 --> 49:23.094
Maybe it all
will be worth it.

49:23.128 --> 49:25.196
I hope so.
It sure is costing us
a lot of money.

49:25.230 --> 49:26.998
Well, you gotta look
at it like an investment.

49:27.032 --> 49:30.001
That's what
I've been doing.
It really is an investment.

49:30.035 --> 49:32.203
By the way,
she wants to have
lunch with you.

49:32.237 --> 49:34.272
Why?

49:34.305 --> 49:36.207
Well, just to know you.
Make you feel better
about this whole thing.

49:36.241 --> 49:38.076
Just go meet her.

49:38.109 --> 49:40.378
She's your Muse.
I don't have anything
to say to her.

49:40.411 --> 49:41.479
I don't need to meet her.

49:41.512 --> 49:43.548
Honey, what's the big deal?
Let her buy you lunch.

49:43.581 --> 49:44.649
What can it hurt?

49:44.682 --> 49:47.218
What am I talking about?
She doesn't buy anything.

49:47.252 --> 49:48.986
I'll buy you two lunch.

49:49.454 --> 49:50.988
(BOTH LAUGHING)

49:53.391 --> 49:55.660
That is hilarious.
You are so funny.

49:55.693 --> 49:58.329
You think so?
Who cuts your hair?

49:58.363 --> 49:59.464
Is something
wrong with it?

49:59.497 --> 50:01.466
No, I love it.

50:01.499 --> 50:03.568
Oh, this guy, Otto.
He's works at Umberto's.

50:03.601 --> 50:05.336
Oh, I've heard
of that place.

50:05.370 --> 50:06.571
Would you like me
to call him?

50:06.604 --> 50:08.506
That would be great.

50:08.539 --> 50:10.275
So was your mother
a Muse?

50:10.308 --> 50:12.077
Yes, all of the women
in my family.

50:12.110 --> 50:13.344
How about your father?

50:13.378 --> 50:14.512
An alcoholic.

50:14.545 --> 50:16.781
Really? We have
something in common.

50:16.814 --> 50:18.316
Yours, too?

50:18.349 --> 50:19.617
Yeah. It wasn't so bad
when we were kids,

50:19.650 --> 50:22.087
but it was really
embarrassing when
we got in high school.

50:22.120 --> 50:23.288
Is he still living?

50:23.321 --> 50:25.556
Yeah, they're
still together.
They live in Florida.

50:25.590 --> 50:26.891
Well, that sounds nice.

50:26.924 --> 50:29.127
They seem to like it.
At least now they
can drink together.

50:29.160 --> 50:30.761
(LAUGHS)

50:30.795 --> 50:32.230
Did you go to college?

50:32.263 --> 50:33.331
UCLA.

50:33.364 --> 50:34.599
What did you study?

50:34.632 --> 50:36.534
I was pre-law.
I got bored.

50:36.567 --> 50:39.337
It's just that
you have this quality.

50:39.370 --> 50:42.840
And it makes me think
that you could be great
working with the public.

50:42.873 --> 50:44.509
You know, it's so funny
you should say that.

50:44.542 --> 50:45.543
Why?

50:45.576 --> 50:47.178
Because I always
wanted to go
into business.

50:47.212 --> 50:48.613
But I don't know,
it just never happened.

50:49.647 --> 50:52.083
Well, what did
you want to do?

50:52.117 --> 50:54.319
The one thing
I inherited from
my mother is cooking.

50:54.352 --> 50:56.654
She was the world's
greatest cook.
And I can do it, too.

50:57.455 --> 50:58.556
I make these cookies...

50:58.589 --> 51:01.826
I swear, they're
the best cookies
you've ever had.

51:01.859 --> 51:05.296
Really?
I love that.
What kind?

51:05.330 --> 51:09.267
Well, my favorite ones
are the chocolate-oatmeal
blend.

51:09.300 --> 51:11.636
It's a wonderful kind
of combination of tastes.

51:11.669 --> 51:13.671
You see, you get
the smoothness
from the chocolate

51:13.704 --> 51:15.440
and the crunchiness
from the oatmeal.

51:15.473 --> 51:18.443
And anyone who's
ever tasted them,
they never forget it.

51:18.476 --> 51:21.712
So why aren't
you Mrs. Fields?

51:21.746 --> 51:24.115
Oh, I don't know.
You know, I've been
raising my family.

51:24.149 --> 51:25.350
Anyway, it's too late now.

51:25.383 --> 51:26.717
No, it is never too late.

51:26.751 --> 51:30.821
That Famous Amos guy,
he must have been 60
when he got started.

51:30.855 --> 51:33.291
They're always
looking for new people
in the bakery business.

51:33.324 --> 51:36.727
That's where that expression
"flavor of the month"
came from.

51:36.761 --> 51:39.697
Oh, well, I guess
I could think
about it again.

51:41.732 --> 51:43.734
Are you tired?

51:43.768 --> 51:45.770
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

51:45.803 --> 51:49.307
It's just that, you know,
I don't sleep very
well at the hotel.

51:49.340 --> 51:51.342
Oh, well, I know
it can't be the hotel.

51:51.376 --> 51:53.678
I mean, Steven
went all out for you.

51:53.711 --> 51:55.846
You've got
one of the best
suites they have.

51:55.880 --> 51:59.417
Oh, I'm not complaining
about the suite.

51:59.450 --> 52:03.254
It's just, you know,
sometimes I get lonely.

52:03.288 --> 52:04.522
So where
were you before?

52:04.555 --> 52:06.191
A guest house.

52:06.224 --> 52:07.258
And you had to leave?

52:07.292 --> 52:08.793
No, I elected to leave.

52:08.826 --> 52:12.397
I never stay in
one place too long.

52:12.430 --> 52:14.365
Well, would you
like to stay in
another hotel?

52:14.399 --> 52:16.267
No.

52:16.301 --> 52:18.403
(CHUCKLES)
A hotel's a hotel.

52:19.504 --> 52:20.838
Well, forget about it.

52:20.871 --> 52:23.841
Look, let's just
talk about you
and those cookies.

52:23.874 --> 52:25.743
It sure would save us
a lot of money.

52:25.776 --> 52:28.513
Something tells me
she shouldn't live
in the house.

52:28.546 --> 52:30.681
It's costing us
$10,000 a week.

52:30.715 --> 52:31.682
Well, first of all,
you don't even know

52:31.716 --> 52:33.318
that she wants
to move out
of the hotel.

52:33.351 --> 52:34.952
She says
she's not sleeping well.

52:34.985 --> 52:37.822
Well, how can she?
She's ordering too much.

52:37.855 --> 52:39.724
When you're on the phone
with room service
24 hours a day,

52:39.757 --> 52:41.459
how can you sleep?

52:41.492 --> 52:43.461
Whatever,
I'm just trying to help.

52:43.494 --> 52:46.297
Boy, you must have had
some lunch that you want
her to live with us.

52:46.331 --> 52:47.698
I was just thinking
of you.

52:47.732 --> 52:49.300
How so?

52:49.334 --> 52:51.236
Well, you're running
all these errands...

52:51.269 --> 52:53.271
Wouldn't it be
a lot easier if
she was close by?

52:53.304 --> 52:55.673
At least then when
you run to the store
you can come right back home.

52:55.706 --> 52:57.508
I don't think
it's a good idea.

52:57.542 --> 53:00.245
Anyway,
there's no place
for her to stay.

53:00.278 --> 53:02.847
If you move your
office back in here,
she could stay out there.

53:02.880 --> 53:05.550
The guest house is mine.

53:05.583 --> 53:07.385
There's a reason
I moved out of here.

53:07.418 --> 53:09.354
There's no room
for me in the house.

53:09.387 --> 53:11.889
Fine.
I'm just trying to help.

53:11.922 --> 53:14.425
I'm not moving
my office. Let her
stay where she is.

53:14.459 --> 53:18.496
I'm just beginning
to work. Let's
just leave it be.

53:18.529 --> 53:21.732
But if she's not happy,
her musing abilities
might not be as good.

53:21.766 --> 53:23.868
Boy, I can't
believe you.

53:23.901 --> 53:27.638
You went from her
biggest skeptic to
her biggest supporter.

53:27.672 --> 53:29.707
I'm not her supporter.
I'm just thinking of us.

53:29.740 --> 53:30.808
It's not a good idea.

53:30.841 --> 53:31.942
(PHONE RINGING)

53:33.478 --> 53:35.780
(EXHALING)
Hello.

53:35.813 --> 53:37.815
I have a craving.

53:37.848 --> 53:39.216
She can live here.

53:41.051 --> 53:44.322
LAURA: Originally,
when we moved in here,
this room was a mess.

53:44.355 --> 53:45.390
(GRUNTING)

53:45.423 --> 53:48.426
They used it for storage.
Do you like the walls?

53:48.459 --> 53:49.827
SARAH: I really don't.

53:49.860 --> 53:51.228
I don't know if you saw,

53:51.262 --> 53:54.865
but I picked this
sort of soft yellow.
Then, in the other room...

53:54.899 --> 53:56.834
Ooh!

53:56.867 --> 53:59.370
STEVEN: This is
a little heavier
than I thought.

54:00.738 --> 54:03.674
Ladies, we were
going to do
this together.

54:03.708 --> 54:04.742
(CLATTERING)

54:04.775 --> 54:06.644
It was going
to be a project.

54:07.044 --> 54:08.313
Ladies.

54:08.346 --> 54:09.647
I'm not so sure
about the yellow...

54:09.680 --> 54:11.649
STEVEN: Why are you
worried about yellow?

54:11.682 --> 54:13.451
I'm not going
to be able to have
children anymore.

54:13.484 --> 54:15.420
Where do you want
this damn thing?

54:15.453 --> 54:17.021
BOTH: There.

54:17.054 --> 54:20.425
All right.
I'm having
a heart attack.

54:20.458 --> 54:22.927
So I'm going
to put it right here.

54:22.960 --> 54:26.431
And when the paramedics come,
they'll move it
where you want it.

54:33.037 --> 54:34.038
As long as
we're here,

54:34.071 --> 54:36.407
I think we should
get you some
cooking utensils.

54:36.441 --> 54:37.775
If you're gonna
be Mrs. Fields,

54:37.808 --> 54:39.610
you're gonna
need to have all
the right equipment.

54:39.644 --> 54:41.679
Oh, I was just talking.
I don't really think
I want to do that.

54:41.712 --> 54:42.913
Of course
you want
to do that.

54:42.947 --> 54:45.683
You wouldn't
have said it if you
didn't want to do it.

54:45.716 --> 54:47.618
I need an eggbeater.
Do you think that's
too much money?

54:47.652 --> 54:49.754
Oh, nothing's
too much money.

54:49.787 --> 54:51.088
Do you have a Cuisinart?

54:51.121 --> 54:52.857
Oh, no. But I really
don't need that.

54:52.890 --> 54:55.092
Oh, well, obviously
you're not going
to be a real cook.

54:55.125 --> 54:57.862
Real cooks
have Cuisinarts.

54:57.895 --> 54:58.829
All right, I need one.

54:58.863 --> 54:59.930
(EXCLAIMS)

55:01.399 --> 55:03.300
You have
a lot to learn.

55:36.734 --> 55:37.868
(SNORING)

55:41.572 --> 55:42.773
(PHONE RINGING)

55:47.578 --> 55:48.613
Hello.

55:48.646 --> 55:50.615
The walls are too bright.

55:50.648 --> 55:52.950
What is that,
some sort of
World War II code?

55:52.983 --> 55:55.520
I don't like the color.
I won't be able
to sleep well.

55:55.553 --> 55:57.087
We need to paint them
something else.

55:57.121 --> 55:59.089
Here we go again
with the "we."

55:59.123 --> 56:00.725
What would you like
"we" to paint them?

56:00.758 --> 56:02.660
Dark gray.

56:02.693 --> 56:04.695
Aren't the curtains gray?
Why don't you just
look at the curtains?

56:04.729 --> 56:06.030
I'll call a professional.

56:06.063 --> 56:07.865
No, no, no, no. No, no.
I'm on my way.

56:09.934 --> 56:11.536
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

56:14.939 --> 56:17.074
Well, honey,
it's back to the
hardware store.

56:18.142 --> 56:19.444
What are you doing?

56:19.477 --> 56:20.645
Cooking.

56:20.678 --> 56:22.112
Looks like you're
cooking for a city.

56:22.146 --> 56:23.548
I am.

56:23.581 --> 56:24.649
What does that mean?

56:24.682 --> 56:26.817
I really think
I'm going to try this.

56:26.851 --> 56:27.918
Try what?

56:27.952 --> 56:29.620
Why can't I be Mrs. Fields?

56:29.654 --> 56:31.889
My stuff is just
as good as hers.
Maybe better.

56:31.922 --> 56:35.025
Mrs. Fields?
Honey, you don't want
to be Mrs. Fields.

56:35.059 --> 56:36.427
Where did this come from?

56:36.461 --> 56:38.095
What's wrong
with Mrs. Fields?

56:38.128 --> 56:40.164
Well, first of all,
you're Mrs. Phillips.

56:40.731 --> 56:42.533
(SIGHING)

56:42.567 --> 56:45.135
Also, isn't she divorced?
Maybe there's a reason,
you know.

56:46.837 --> 56:48.739
I don't know.

56:48.773 --> 56:53.678
Honey, I don't
have room to even
breathe in the den.

56:53.711 --> 56:55.646
We have no more
guest house.

56:55.680 --> 56:57.047
I really don't think
we should be running

56:57.081 --> 56:58.449
a business out
of our home.

56:58.483 --> 57:00.084
We don't have
the room, do we?

57:00.117 --> 57:02.019
If this works out,
I'll find a big kitchen
somewhere.

57:02.052 --> 57:05.923
Don't you worry about it.
Just concentrate
on your writing.

57:05.956 --> 57:07.792
Oh, well,
that's good advice.

57:07.825 --> 57:10.695
If you need me,
I'll be in the creative
section of Home Base.

57:21.772 --> 57:22.907
(SIGHING)

57:24.074 --> 57:25.976
Hi. Did you get the paint?

57:26.010 --> 57:27.545
You just told me
40 seconds ago.

57:27.578 --> 57:29.213
I didn't have time
to do the actual errand.

57:29.246 --> 57:31.649
Oh. Well, I'd like
to paint today.

57:31.682 --> 57:33.718
The sooner I paint,
the sooner I can sleep.
Okay?

57:33.751 --> 57:36.521
Okay. I have a question.

57:36.554 --> 57:38.623
Was it your idea
to get my wife
into business?

57:38.656 --> 57:40.791
It's never my idea.
That's not how I work.

57:40.825 --> 57:42.793
She wants to be
this chef now.

57:42.827 --> 57:44.895
You've got nothing
to worry about.
You should be excited.

57:44.929 --> 57:46.764
She's going
to make a fortune.

57:46.797 --> 57:49.099
Well, I don't need her
to make a fortune.
I can support our family.

57:49.133 --> 57:51.168
(CHUCKLING)
Can you?

57:51.201 --> 57:52.703
What does that mean?

57:52.737 --> 57:54.204
Nothing. It's just that
I don't really think

57:54.238 --> 57:56.574
that this should be about
who makes the money.

57:57.742 --> 57:59.143
Let her blossom.

57:59.176 --> 58:01.111
And you've got
some writing to do.

58:01.145 --> 58:03.280
How can I write?
You want me to paint.

58:03.313 --> 58:06.651
Oh! That reminds me.
When you go to the hardware
store, I need tacks.

58:09.286 --> 58:11.889
I'm turning into something
I don't want to be.

58:13.323 --> 58:14.525
(SNIFFING)

58:18.929 --> 58:20.097
(SIGHING)

58:21.165 --> 58:22.232
Do you want me
to be honest?

58:22.266 --> 58:24.234
Yes, of course.

58:24.268 --> 58:25.903
These are the best
cookies I ever had.

58:25.936 --> 58:27.237
Yes!

58:27.271 --> 58:30.140
Ever. They simply
melt in your mouth.

58:30.174 --> 58:31.542
But are they good
enough to sell?

58:31.576 --> 58:33.744
You make Famous Amos
look dead.

58:33.778 --> 58:35.512
I think he is dead.

58:35.913 --> 58:37.548
I'm finished.

58:37.582 --> 58:39.850
Honey, don't walk
on the floor!

58:39.884 --> 58:43.988
I'm not an astronaut.
I have to touch something.

58:44.021 --> 58:46.757
That's not the color
of paint you're gonna use,
is it?

58:46.791 --> 58:50.160
It looks lighter
on my face than
it does on the wall.

58:50.194 --> 58:52.697
Why don't you run
upstairs real quick,
see if you can sleep?

58:52.730 --> 58:54.531
Here, honey.
Taste these.

58:59.303 --> 59:02.339
Oh, my God.
These are sensational.

59:02.372 --> 59:04.041
People would
buy them, right?

59:04.074 --> 59:05.610
Well, sure,
people would buy them.

59:05.643 --> 59:07.612
But is that what
you really want to do?

59:07.645 --> 59:09.714
Why don't you
just bake them
for all of us?

59:09.747 --> 59:11.616
Why don't you want her
to sell them?

59:12.917 --> 59:14.652
Whose Muse are you?

59:15.953 --> 59:18.055
I'll be upstairs,
looking at the wall.

59:20.390 --> 59:23.360
Look, I just
want to try this.

59:23.393 --> 59:25.229
Sarah knows someone
at this restaurant,

59:25.262 --> 59:27.998
and we're just gonna
take some over there
and see what happens.

59:28.032 --> 59:29.667
Restaurant?
What restaurant?

59:29.700 --> 59:31.001
Spago.

59:31.035 --> 59:34.171
Spago?
Spago's gonna
take the cookies?

59:34.204 --> 59:36.173
Well, Sarah
knows Wolfgang.

59:36.206 --> 59:38.843
Wolfgang? Oh, my.

59:38.876 --> 59:41.912
I'm at the hardware store
20 minutes, and you're
now calling him Wolfgang.

59:41.946 --> 59:43.614
I'm sure nothing
will come of this.

59:43.648 --> 59:44.849
I'm sure everything
will come of it.

59:45.816 --> 59:46.984
Sweetheart,

59:48.686 --> 59:50.287
there's something
in my mind
and I want to get it out.

59:50.320 --> 59:53.057
And I want to say it
in the correct way,

59:53.090 --> 59:54.925
because I love you
very much.

59:54.959 --> 01:00:00.230
So how do I phrase this
in a way that's delicate
without overdoing it?

01:00:00.264 --> 01:00:02.399
I just... I want
to make sure
that it's right.

01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:05.803
I have no script!
I have nothing!

01:00:05.836 --> 01:00:07.337
I have a little bit
of writing
in the beginning,

01:00:07.371 --> 01:00:10.207
and then the pages
slowly go to white.

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:12.176
Then I have lots
of white pages.

01:00:12.209 --> 01:00:14.378
It's like little
clouds on my desk.

01:00:14.411 --> 01:00:16.981
Studios hate white!
They don't pay for that.

01:00:17.014 --> 01:00:20.084
Did you see The Shining?
I'm jealous of him!

01:00:20.117 --> 01:00:23.420
He at least had
one good sentence!
I don't have that!

01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:26.123
Sure, he repeated
it too much, but
it was a good one.

01:00:26.156 --> 01:00:29.093
"Steven runs an errand."
I could do that.
I could try that!

01:00:29.126 --> 01:00:30.728
I have nothing!

01:00:30.761 --> 01:00:35.032
And I'm just a little
afraid that if she...

01:00:35.065 --> 01:00:37.935
What? What?
If she gives to me,
it takes from you?

01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:39.336
Well, I didn't
say that exactly.

01:00:39.369 --> 01:00:40.304
Well, that's
what you're thinking.

01:00:40.337 --> 01:00:42.673
I don't know
how a Muse works.
Do you?

01:00:42.707 --> 01:00:45.442
Look at mythology.
Why were there nine of them?

01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:48.378
I think they all had
a little, teeny task.

01:00:48.412 --> 01:00:50.681
Each one had
an assignment.

01:00:50.715 --> 01:00:52.850
Maybe we're
overloading her.

01:00:52.883 --> 01:00:56.220
Maybe writing and cooking
is not something she can do.

01:00:56.253 --> 01:00:58.055
It's like an electric socket.

01:00:58.088 --> 01:00:59.990
You know, it'll take
a toaster and a lamp,

01:01:00.024 --> 01:01:02.426
but then you plug in
the dryer and the
house goes dark!

01:01:02.459 --> 01:01:04.862
And I think our house
is starting to go dark.

01:01:04.895 --> 01:01:06.864
She can help you
with your writing.
I can cook on my own.

01:01:06.897 --> 01:01:08.232
No, no, no, no, no.
I don't want to do that.

01:01:08.265 --> 01:01:10.434
You use her.
Go ahead.
Use her.

01:01:10.467 --> 01:01:13.070
I'm just saying that...
Use her.

01:01:15.039 --> 01:01:16.741
She's actually
living with you?

01:01:16.774 --> 01:01:17.908
STEVEN: She's not
living with us.

01:01:17.942 --> 01:01:20.444
She's just staying
with us for a while.
That's all.

01:01:21.145 --> 01:01:22.747
Where?

01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:25.950
She's in the guest house.
It used to be my office.

01:01:25.983 --> 01:01:27.384
Where are you?

01:01:27.885 --> 01:01:29.186
I'm in the den.

01:01:30.755 --> 01:01:34.258
Steven, you know, be careful.
Don't get too close.

01:01:35.025 --> 01:01:36.326
What does that mean?

01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:41.131
Well, just
keep your distance.

01:01:41.165 --> 01:01:43.433
Never get too
close to a Muse.

01:01:43.467 --> 01:01:46.270
Well, you never
told me this before.

01:01:46.303 --> 01:01:49.373
Is there some list
of Muse rules
I need to know?

01:01:49.406 --> 01:01:51.008
No, no, not really.

01:01:51.041 --> 01:01:52.209
Let me ask you this.

01:01:52.242 --> 01:01:53.844
(GRUNTING)

01:01:53.878 --> 01:01:55.880
You think she can help
too many people at once?

01:01:56.947 --> 01:01:58.415
What?

01:01:58.448 --> 01:02:00.184
She's starting
to help out Laura.

01:02:00.217 --> 01:02:02.152
And I'm just wondering,
do you think that's okay?

01:02:02.186 --> 01:02:05.489
Doesn't it maybe
take from the idea
of helping me?

01:02:05.522 --> 01:02:08.525
What's she doing
with Laura?

01:02:08.558 --> 01:02:10.327
Laura wants
to be Mrs. Fields.

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:11.896
She's going into
the cookie business.

01:02:11.929 --> 01:02:13.397
Oh, really?

01:02:14.832 --> 01:02:18.235
And Sarah's helping her?
Well, that's good for her.

01:02:18.268 --> 01:02:21.171
Well, what about that?
You think that's okay?

01:02:21.205 --> 01:02:23.941
Don't you think that
diminishes her capacity?

01:02:23.974 --> 01:02:26.911
I wouldn't
worry about it.
You ready?

01:02:26.944 --> 01:02:28.979
Yeah, I've been
ready since 7:00.

01:02:29.013 --> 01:02:32.282
Oh, by the way,
I need to see her
for about an hour later.

01:02:32.316 --> 01:02:33.450
Is that okay?

01:02:33.483 --> 01:02:35.152
No, it's really
not okay.

01:02:35.185 --> 01:02:38.055
I haven't had two minutes
by myself with this woman.

01:02:38.088 --> 01:02:39.289
I'm only going
to take a little while.

01:02:39.323 --> 01:02:41.358
I just have to run
an idea past her.

01:02:41.391 --> 01:02:42.960
Sure, come on over.

01:02:42.993 --> 01:02:44.228
Bring your luggage,
move in.

01:02:44.261 --> 01:02:46.864
I can just rot outside.
I don't care.

01:02:46.897 --> 01:02:48.098
Oh, thanks, man.
Yeah.

01:02:50.901 --> 01:02:52.269
You're doing really good
with the game here.

01:02:52.302 --> 01:02:54.204
Give me the number
of that teacher.

01:02:55.039 --> 01:02:56.173
Is he alive?

01:02:56.841 --> 01:02:58.075
You ready?

01:02:58.108 --> 01:02:59.877
I'm going to go inside
and take a piss.
You keep playing.

01:03:04.314 --> 01:03:08.018
Spectacular.
It's unbelievable.

01:03:08.052 --> 01:03:10.554
This is the cookie
equivalent of my pizza.

01:03:10.587 --> 01:03:11.555
Told you.

01:03:11.588 --> 01:03:14.258
I'm so flattered.
I think you're brilliant.

01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:15.993
We'll start serving
them at Spago.

01:03:16.026 --> 01:03:17.394
Then I'll take it
to Chinois.

01:03:17.427 --> 01:03:19.964
If it works there,
the sky is the limit.

01:03:19.997 --> 01:03:21.398
I don't know how
to thank you.

01:03:21.431 --> 01:03:24.001
Wolf, you're a doll.

01:03:24.034 --> 01:03:27.004
By the way, Sarah,
I have a little something
for you. Come with me.

01:03:27.037 --> 01:03:28.238
(GIGGLES)

01:03:35.612 --> 01:03:38.883
Thanks for
all your help on Postrio.
It's doing so wonderful.

01:03:41.886 --> 01:03:43.420
How did he make
the decision so quickly?

01:03:43.453 --> 01:03:45.222
I thought it would
take a long time.

01:03:45.255 --> 01:03:46.891
Uh-uh.
That's the way
he operates.

01:03:46.924 --> 01:03:49.493
When he came up with pizza,
it took him about 30 seconds

01:03:49.526 --> 01:03:51.561
to decide between goat
cheese and mozzarella.

01:03:51.595 --> 01:03:53.463
How do you know that?

01:03:53.497 --> 01:03:54.899
Honey...

01:04:07.311 --> 01:04:08.645
STEVEN: Honey?

01:04:08.678 --> 01:04:09.980
Not now, baby,
I'm baking.

01:04:10.014 --> 01:04:11.916
I'm starving.

01:04:11.949 --> 01:04:13.017
Have a cookie!

01:04:13.050 --> 01:04:14.885
I'm not six.
I'd like a meal.

01:04:14.919 --> 01:04:17.054
Honey, take the kids,
go to McDonald's, please.

01:04:17.087 --> 01:04:18.655
I'm up to my ears in this.

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:20.090
JACK: Hey, buddy!

01:04:21.558 --> 01:04:23.593
Hey.

01:04:23.627 --> 01:04:24.929
What's he doing here?

01:04:24.962 --> 01:04:28.398
Just raping her for
her last remaining
drops of inspiration.

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:34.438
Everything sold out by 9:00.
9:00! Isn't that amazing?

01:04:34.471 --> 01:04:37.141
That is fantastic, honey.

01:04:37.174 --> 01:04:39.109
So, now you did it.
You've proved it.

01:04:39.143 --> 01:04:41.578
Now we can go back
to the way we were.

01:04:41.611 --> 01:04:43.013
What, are you crazy?

01:04:43.047 --> 01:04:46.483
Why should we go back?
It's happening.
I'm hiring two more people.

01:04:46.516 --> 01:04:49.086
We don't have
the room here for that.

01:04:49.119 --> 01:04:51.288
I found a place.
Where?

01:04:51.321 --> 01:04:54.191
Sarah found me this
wonderful old bakery
on Venice.

01:04:54.224 --> 01:04:55.459
It's absolutely perfect.

01:04:55.492 --> 01:04:59.096
I can have it month to month.
It even has stoves that work.

01:04:59.129 --> 01:05:01.531
I'm supposed to be
getting help with
my writing.

01:05:01.565 --> 01:05:04.301
I don't have a third act,
and you're taking out a lease.

01:05:04.334 --> 01:05:05.970
I'm not taking out a lease,
it's month to month.

01:05:06.003 --> 01:05:07.304
All right,
stop being literal.

01:05:07.337 --> 01:05:09.339
Hey, if this works out,
you won't have to
sell your script.

01:05:09.373 --> 01:05:11.141
I can support us.

01:05:15.145 --> 01:05:19.149
I just don't see you
going back to the water
anytime soon.

01:05:19.183 --> 01:05:22.052
(WHISPERING)
That's all I can say
right now.

01:05:22.086 --> 01:05:24.154
So, no sequel?

01:05:25.022 --> 01:05:26.356
No.

01:05:27.657 --> 01:05:29.259
I can't thank you
enough, Sarah.

01:05:29.293 --> 01:05:31.395
Well, you come
see me anytime.

01:05:31.428 --> 01:05:32.963
I will. Bye-bye.

01:05:41.171 --> 01:05:43.140
I almost forgot.

01:05:43.173 --> 01:05:44.541
Okay, I'll open it later.

01:05:44.574 --> 01:05:45.609
You'll like it.

01:05:45.642 --> 01:05:48.112
I bought it after
the Titanic bonus.

01:05:48.678 --> 01:05:50.180
It's not...

01:05:51.115 --> 01:05:52.316
(CHUCKLES) God, no.

01:06:00.224 --> 01:06:01.491
No water.

01:06:02.292 --> 01:06:03.994
Stay out of the water.

01:06:05.095 --> 01:06:06.463
Stay away from the water.

01:06:07.497 --> 01:06:09.166
Don't go near the water.

01:06:10.267 --> 01:06:11.601
(DOOR CLOSING)

01:06:13.203 --> 01:06:16.240
Hey, can we talk
for a second?

01:06:16.273 --> 01:06:17.507
I'm late.
We'll talk later.

01:06:17.541 --> 01:06:18.408
Where are you going?

01:06:18.442 --> 01:06:20.577
I don't ask you
those questions, do I?

01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:22.779
I haven't had a minute
with you for days.

01:06:22.812 --> 01:06:25.015
I need to write.
You're so busy
with everybody else.

01:06:25.049 --> 01:06:26.116
What do you need?

01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:27.517
Well, how about
a third act?

01:06:27.551 --> 01:06:30.087
I'd go back to
the aquarium.
That's what I think.

01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:31.755
I have to go back there?

01:06:31.788 --> 01:06:34.991
Then don't.
Don't take my advice.
See you.

01:06:36.226 --> 01:06:37.161
(EXCLAIMING)

01:06:40.097 --> 01:06:42.366
Listen, I'll go back there.
It's all right.

01:06:42.399 --> 01:06:43.767
It's just, what am I
going to find?

01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:46.670
Why don't you go,
and then you can tell me.

01:06:46.703 --> 01:06:48.372
STEVEN: Okay,
but please answer this.

01:06:48.405 --> 01:06:51.508
Should Jim Carrey
sell the park?

01:06:51.541 --> 01:06:53.610
See, I don't know
whether to introduce
a new character

01:06:53.643 --> 01:06:55.279
at this stage
in the script.

01:06:55.312 --> 01:06:57.381
Like someone who would
come in and buy it.

01:06:57.414 --> 01:06:58.782
Do you understand
what I'm asking?

01:06:58.815 --> 01:07:00.484
What do you think?
I'm confused.

01:07:01.518 --> 01:07:02.786
(CAR ENGINE STARTING)

01:07:04.254 --> 01:07:06.423
Did you say
don't or do?

01:07:06.456 --> 01:07:09.059
Sell it?
No, sell it or not?

01:07:09.826 --> 01:07:11.295
Don't?

01:07:11.728 --> 01:07:13.097
Do?

01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:17.534
You're going where?

01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:21.571
STEVEN: It's called the
Aquarium of the Pacific.

01:07:21.605 --> 01:07:23.006
JACK ON PHONE: Why?

01:07:23.039 --> 01:07:26.343
Well, I don't wanna
say too much. It's sort of
what I'm working on.

01:07:26.376 --> 01:07:27.444
What, you're afraid
I'll gonna steal it?

01:07:28.112 --> 01:07:30.547
No. Yeah.

01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:33.217
Oh, by the way, I need
to come over tomorrow.

01:07:33.250 --> 01:07:34.784
I need about half an hour.

01:07:34.818 --> 01:07:37.287
Maybe you ought to
start bringing
some food with you.

01:07:37.321 --> 01:07:39.289
I'll bring some food
with me, if you want.

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:42.792
How long do you think
she's going to be
living with you?

01:07:42.826 --> 01:07:45.362
Well, actually, I wanted
to talk to you about that.

01:07:45.395 --> 01:07:48.398
I figured once
I got my script,
I would ask her to leave.

01:07:48.432 --> 01:07:50.434
Steven, be careful.

01:07:50.467 --> 01:07:51.768
Be careful?
Of what?

01:07:51.801 --> 01:07:54.238
Well, just make sure
you don't piss her off.

01:07:54.271 --> 01:07:56.206
You don't wanna
piss off a Muse.

01:07:56.240 --> 01:08:00.677
If you get them angry,
they could do the opposite of
what they're supposed to do.

01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:01.945
What's the opposite?

01:08:01.978 --> 01:08:04.681
You might never think up
another idea again.

01:08:04.714 --> 01:08:08.285
Oh, my God,
that can't be true.
Is that true?

01:08:08.318 --> 01:08:09.786
You don't even
want to know.

01:08:09.819 --> 01:08:12.222
Oh, no. No.

01:08:17.627 --> 01:08:19.529
Hello.
Hi. How many today?

01:08:19.563 --> 01:08:21.898
One.
Okay, that's $13.95.

01:08:21.930 --> 01:08:24.167
So, what time does
the next show go on?

01:08:24.201 --> 01:08:26.170
Oh, the next show
is canceled, sir.

01:08:26.203 --> 01:08:27.703
Canceled? Why?

01:08:27.737 --> 01:08:29.805
One of the sea lions
is not feeling well.

01:08:29.839 --> 01:08:30.907
You're kidding.

01:08:30.939 --> 01:08:32.376
No. I'm sorry, sir.

01:08:32.408 --> 01:08:35.179
The fish isn't feeling well,
and he doesn't have to work?

01:08:35.212 --> 01:08:36.580
Apparently not.

01:08:36.613 --> 01:08:39.349
Gee, if I'm not feeling well,
they make me show up.

01:08:39.383 --> 01:08:40.684
I guess I'm in
the wrong species, huh?

01:08:40.716 --> 01:08:42.551
I guess you are, sir.

01:08:42.586 --> 01:08:43.819
(LAUGHS) Thank you.
WOMAN: Thank you.

01:08:44.854 --> 01:08:47.191
How do you like that?

01:08:47.224 --> 01:08:49.359
Who even knew
fish got sick?

01:08:49.393 --> 01:08:52.296
(SCOFFS) What do they do,
stick a thermometer
in their tush?

01:08:52.328 --> 01:08:53.596
How do they even know?

01:08:55.765 --> 01:08:56.832
Oh, my God.

01:08:58.202 --> 01:09:01.371
That's it!
That's it!

01:09:02.272 --> 01:09:03.307
Sick fish!

01:09:03.673 --> 01:09:05.774
(LAUGHING)

01:09:05.809 --> 01:09:07.042
They don't do any tricks.

01:09:07.076 --> 01:09:10.546
They're on stretchers,
and they got
slings on their fins.

01:09:11.314 --> 01:09:13.417
And then they start dying.

01:09:13.450 --> 01:09:14.818
Can you see it?
He's got huge crowds.

01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:18.354
They're all waiting
for something, and he's got
dead fish to show off.

01:09:18.388 --> 01:09:20.256
This is wonderful!
Isn't it?

01:09:20.290 --> 01:09:21.558
Where do you come up
with this stuff?

01:09:21.591 --> 01:09:23.560
This is the funniest thing
I've heard in years.

01:09:23.593 --> 01:09:25.462
You're gonna have yourself
a big hit, Steven.

01:09:25.495 --> 01:09:28.398
So, listen, make the deal now,
'cause I really need the cash.

01:09:28.432 --> 01:09:30.834
You can make a deal
based on an idea,
can't you?

01:09:30.867 --> 01:09:34.703
You're so close to finishing.
Just finish up the script.
We'll get 10 times as much.

01:09:34.738 --> 01:09:37.207
Don't you wanna strike
while the iron is hot?

01:09:37.241 --> 01:09:39.908
Finish the goddamn script.
The iron will be on fire.

01:09:39.943 --> 01:09:43.380
Hey, you know what
might be funny?

01:09:43.412 --> 01:09:46.483
They should open up
a sushi bar at the park and
they can eat the dead fish.

01:09:47.551 --> 01:09:48.685
(CHUCKLING)

01:09:50.254 --> 01:09:51.621
You negotiate,
let me write.

01:09:51.654 --> 01:09:53.323
It's just an idea.
I throw 'em out.

01:09:53.357 --> 01:09:54.258
If you don't like 'em,
don't use 'em.

01:09:54.291 --> 01:09:55.959
Does anybody
ever use them?

01:09:57.026 --> 01:09:59.463
No, not really.
I didn't think so.

01:09:59.496 --> 01:10:01.565
All right.
I'll talk to you later.

01:10:01.598 --> 01:10:03.933
By the way,
congratulations.
On what?

01:10:03.967 --> 01:10:05.635
Those cookies
your wife is making.

01:10:05.669 --> 01:10:07.771
It's all over town.
They're terrific.

01:10:07.804 --> 01:10:09.439
The hit of Spago.

01:10:09.473 --> 01:10:12.309
Oh, yeah. Thanks.
I'll tell her.

01:10:12.342 --> 01:10:14.344
Think about eating
those dead fish.

01:10:14.378 --> 01:10:16.546
Okay. No good.

01:10:22.986 --> 01:10:25.021
Hello? May I help you?

01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:27.557
What?
Oh, my God.

01:10:27.591 --> 01:10:29.526
Is Sarah here?

01:10:29.559 --> 01:10:31.728
If she doesn't
answer the door,
I don't think she's there.

01:10:31.761 --> 01:10:34.264
Damn it! Damn it!

01:10:34.298 --> 01:10:36.633
Oh, God, I've been
trying to get her.
I can't get a hold of her.

01:10:36.666 --> 01:10:38.535
I'm trying to work
this thing out.
I'm right in the middle of it.

01:10:38.568 --> 01:10:40.537
By the way, your parking
here is nonexistent.

01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:42.038
It really is a problem.
You should do
something about it.

01:10:42.071 --> 01:10:43.973
Well, give me six months,
I'll put in a lot.

01:10:44.007 --> 01:10:45.575
You know what time
she's getting back?
No, I don't.

01:10:45.609 --> 01:10:48.278
Do you have a room around
here where I can wait,
like magazines or whatever?

01:10:48.312 --> 01:10:49.513
It's my private home.
I really don't have
a waiting room.

01:10:49.546 --> 01:10:50.847
Well, just tell her
Marty was here, okay?

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:52.982
I got to get this thing
figured out. I'm right
in the middle of it.

01:10:53.016 --> 01:10:54.718
I got to get
it figured out.
What are you working on?

01:10:54.751 --> 01:10:55.885
Promise you won't
tell anybody?
Yeah.

01:10:55.919 --> 01:10:57.987
I'm working on a remake
of Raging Bull.
Really?

01:10:58.021 --> 01:11:00.524
Yeah, only this time,
I'm doing it with
a real thin guy.

01:11:00.557 --> 01:11:02.759
Real thin.
Can you see it?
Can you see it?

01:11:02.792 --> 01:11:05.562
Yeah, I see it.
Not like normal thin,
but really thin.

01:11:05.595 --> 01:11:07.297
A real thin guy.
Thin, but angry.

01:11:07.331 --> 01:11:08.565
Angry?
Angry.

01:11:08.598 --> 01:11:10.066
Can you see it?
Angry, too.

01:11:10.099 --> 01:11:11.635
Thin and angry.
Thin and angry.
Thin, thin.

01:11:11.668 --> 01:11:12.802
Thin and angry.
Thin. Wow.

01:11:12.836 --> 01:11:14.371
Yeah.
Good idea.

01:11:14.404 --> 01:11:15.739
Is there a Starbucks
near here?

01:11:15.772 --> 01:11:18.074
Oh, gee. I'd be careful
if I were you. You might
have had your quota.

01:11:18.107 --> 01:11:19.909
Yeah, I guess
I've had my... Quota!

01:11:19.943 --> 01:11:21.077
That gives me an idea
for something else entirely.

01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:22.045
Thank you. We never had
this conversation.

01:11:22.078 --> 01:11:24.047
I don't know who you are.
We never spoke.

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:26.350
By the way,
the gift's in the mail.
Tell her, okay?

01:11:26.383 --> 01:11:27.817
Hey, I sent you a script
two years ago!

01:11:27.851 --> 01:11:29.052
Never got it.

01:11:45.835 --> 01:11:46.803
You are doing
a great job.

01:11:46.836 --> 01:11:48.705
Thanks to you.

01:11:48.738 --> 01:11:50.073
Ready to go to lunch?

01:11:50.106 --> 01:11:51.675
Oh, I'm ready.
Oh, good.

01:11:53.677 --> 01:11:54.644
I'll be back.

01:11:58.615 --> 01:12:00.617
I have a proposal
for you.

01:12:01.651 --> 01:12:03.553
I'm listening.

01:12:03.587 --> 01:12:05.088
What if you went into
business with me?

01:12:05.121 --> 01:12:06.956
You're the one
who inspired all this.

01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:09.559
I could put you
on the board. You
could have a big part.

01:12:09.593 --> 01:12:13.563
Oh, I can't get too involved.
That's not what a Muse does.

01:12:13.597 --> 01:12:16.666
I wish you would
think about it. I really
like having you around.

01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:19.969
I have to be careful.
I can't overstep my bounds.

01:12:20.003 --> 01:12:21.971
I could anger the gods.

01:12:22.005 --> 01:12:24.040
(WHISPERING)
That could be dangerous.

01:12:24.073 --> 01:12:26.009
Really? You could
anger the gods?

(EXCLAIMS)

01:12:27.777 --> 01:12:31.080
What could happen to you?
Would they punish you?

01:12:31.114 --> 01:12:34.050
Oh, you don't
want to know.

01:12:34.083 --> 01:12:37.521
You don't know what
wrath is until you've
seen Zeus get pissed.

(SIGHS)

01:12:39.456 --> 01:12:43.059
Oh, my God, I keep forgetting
your life is so incredible.

01:12:44.594 --> 01:12:46.796
Did you ever meet Zeus?

01:12:46.830 --> 01:12:48.432
Meet him?

01:12:49.899 --> 01:12:51.501
He's my father.

01:12:51.801 --> 01:12:54.070
Wow!

01:12:54.103 --> 01:12:56.673
He was the one with
the drinking problem?

01:12:56.706 --> 01:12:58.642
Honey, all the gods drink.

01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:05.181
Oh, you have been so nice
to me, and so has Steven.

01:13:05.214 --> 01:13:07.984
And I know you've gone
out of your way to make me
comfortable in your home,

01:13:08.017 --> 01:13:09.886
but I have a problem.

01:13:09.919 --> 01:13:13.122
I'm not sleeping well.
I'm not comfortable
in the guest house.

01:13:13.156 --> 01:13:16.493
And you know how sensitive
I am as to where I sleep.

01:13:17.494 --> 01:13:20.597
You know, a Muse
needs her sleep.

01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:25.769
I need a calm, secure,
restful place.

01:13:25.802 --> 01:13:29.773
We'll fix it.
What can we do?
We'll take care of it.

01:13:29.806 --> 01:13:32.842
Oh, I don't think
there's anything
you can do. It just...

01:13:33.943 --> 01:13:36.480
It feels wrong.

01:13:36.513 --> 01:13:41.417
Well, what if you were
to move into the main house?
How would you like that?

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:46.189
Well, do you think
I'd be more comfortable
on the couch?

01:13:47.724 --> 01:13:49.626
You don't have to sleep
on the couch.

01:13:49.659 --> 01:13:52.529
Just give some time,
I can figure this out.
We don't want you to go.

01:13:52.562 --> 01:13:54.864
I'll figure
something out.
Oh...

01:13:56.733 --> 01:13:58.768
We gave her the
damn guest house.

01:13:58.802 --> 01:14:01.671
If she's not happy,
let her move back
to the hotel.

01:14:01.705 --> 01:14:03.873
I'm not that happy,
either, by the way.

01:14:03.907 --> 01:14:05.742
Every time I come home here,
it's like the Friars Club.

I don't know who
I'm gonna see next.

We don't want her
to move back to the hotel.

01:14:10.046 --> 01:14:13.149

What if we gave her
the bedroom?

01:14:13.182 --> 01:14:14.584
Honey.

big enough for one person,
let alone two.

Where are we gonna sleep?

01:14:19.088 --> 01:14:21.057
That's not exactly
what I had in mind.

01:14:21.090 --> 01:14:23.860
I don't even want
to hear this.

01:14:23.893 --> 01:14:25.662
She could bunk
in here with me,
you could sleep out there,

01:14:25.695 --> 01:14:28.097
just for a while,
till she gets comfortable.

01:14:28.131 --> 01:14:30.934
She could bunk
in here with you?

01:14:30.967 --> 01:14:33.069
Did you join the Girl Scouts
when I wasn't looking?

01:14:33.102 --> 01:14:35.138
Since when have you
used the word "bunk"?

01:14:35.171 --> 01:14:36.840
Forget it.
I'm just trying to help.

01:14:36.873 --> 01:14:39.543
It's a bad idea.
I don't want to
give up the bedroom.

to her, are you?

to sleep with her?

make her happy.

the better muse she is.

Don't you want the
best muse you can get?

I can get that does not
live in the bed.

should open stores.

Yes, but not so fast.

there. Maybe you are not
telling me the truth?

01:17:32.181 --> 01:17:33.416
I'm telling the truth.

01:17:33.449 --> 01:17:36.285
I think Mr. Fields is
a big, fat liar.

01:17:36.319 --> 01:17:37.420
(ALL LAUGHING)

01:17:44.961 --> 01:17:47.964
I'm only doing this for
one night only, that's it.

01:17:47.997 --> 01:17:50.266
Then we have to think
of something else.

01:17:50.299 --> 01:17:52.936
You're a doll.
We're only making her happy.

01:17:52.969 --> 01:17:56.139
I'm sure your third act
will come that much faster.

01:17:56.172 --> 01:17:57.907
I don't know what was wrong
with the guest house.

01:17:57.941 --> 01:18:00.744
I was out there for years,
it seemed fine to me.

01:18:01.410 --> 01:18:03.847
Listen, I made a decision.

01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:05.414
As soon as I'm through
with my script,

01:18:05.448 --> 01:18:09.152
I'm gonna ask her
very gently to leave.

01:18:09.185 --> 01:18:11.888
Are you sure that's okay?
You know what Jack said.

01:18:11.921 --> 01:18:13.957
Well, I don't care
what Jack said.
What can I do?

01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:17.260
If she wants to take
away my creativity,
then she'll do it.

01:18:17.293 --> 01:18:20.229
But I want my house back.

01:18:20.263 --> 01:18:23.166
(SIGHS) This is like
The Muse Who Came to Dinner.

01:18:23.199 --> 01:18:25.902
Hi.
Hey! How are you?

01:18:25.935 --> 01:18:27.837
Um, do you have
an extra drawer,

01:18:27.871 --> 01:18:31.174
because I'd really like to
unpack before I go to sleep.

01:18:31.207 --> 01:18:34.443
You have all these very
particular rules about
sleeping. It's interesting.

01:18:34.477 --> 01:18:37.046
Me, I would just
leave the stuff
in the suitcase.

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:39.749
Here, take this drawer.

01:18:39.783 --> 01:18:40.784
Oh.

01:18:43.452 --> 01:18:44.754
(HUMMING)

01:18:46.189 --> 01:18:47.957
Sarah?
Yeah?

01:18:47.991 --> 01:18:50.393
After you get your
wonderful night's sleep...
Yeah.

01:18:50.426 --> 01:18:54.263
Maybe in the morning
you'll sit down with me.
I would love to write.

01:18:54.297 --> 01:18:58.902
Well, you know,
it's not really my job
to come up with ideas.

01:18:58.935 --> 01:19:01.905
It's my job to inspire.

01:19:01.938 --> 01:19:04.307
But I'm sleeping
in the garage.

01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:06.742
So maybe you could
come up with
at least one idea.

01:19:08.344 --> 01:19:11.347
Okay. But just one.

01:19:11.380 --> 01:19:14.350
You know how the whole
California coast has a lot
of oil running underneath it?

01:19:14.383 --> 01:19:15.618
Yes, I do.

01:19:15.651 --> 01:19:18.487
And in your script,
you're building this
big fish tank, right?

01:19:18.521 --> 01:19:20.523
Right. They're constructing
a huge one.

01:19:20.556 --> 01:19:23.092
So you've got one of these
big construction machines,

01:19:23.126 --> 01:19:25.194
and it's digging and
digging and digging,
and bam!

01:19:25.228 --> 01:19:27.997
It hits oil and
everybody's a millionaire.

01:19:28.031 --> 01:19:29.498
You mean like
The Beverly Hillbillies?

01:19:29.532 --> 01:19:30.566
Yeah.

01:19:30.599 --> 01:19:33.002
That sounds hysterical!

01:19:33.036 --> 01:19:34.337
So what you're saying is,

01:19:34.370 --> 01:19:36.973
even though they've
lost a huge amount
of money on the park,

01:19:37.006 --> 01:19:38.842
all of a sudden they're
like these millionaires

01:19:38.875 --> 01:19:40.576
for a reason we don't
even know about.

01:19:40.609 --> 01:19:41.978
Exactly.

01:19:42.011 --> 01:19:45.114
If he's now this millionaire,
he could give the
park to charity.

01:19:46.582 --> 01:19:49.118
He can free all the Willys!

01:19:49.152 --> 01:19:51.220
There you go.
You got your third act.

01:19:51.254 --> 01:19:54.991
This is great! Okay.
Honey, I'll see you
in the morning.

01:19:55.024 --> 01:19:56.092
Good night, honey.

01:19:56.125 --> 01:19:58.094
I've got a place
to go now!

01:20:00.163 --> 01:20:02.531
So, what side of the bed
do you want?

01:20:02.565 --> 01:20:05.168
Oh, you're going to
sleep in the bed, too?

01:20:06.135 --> 01:20:09.272
Well, what was your idea?

01:20:09.305 --> 01:20:11.374
No, that's okay,
we can share the bed.

01:20:11.407 --> 01:20:13.309
You want the whole bed?

01:20:13.342 --> 01:20:15.611
Well, hey, it's your house,
you know. Whatever
you wanna do.

01:20:15.644 --> 01:20:19.215
Oh, my God.
You want the bed,
take it.

01:20:19.248 --> 01:20:20.383
Where will you sleep?

01:20:20.416 --> 01:20:22.151
I'll sleep on the floor.

01:20:22.185 --> 01:20:24.253
Oh, I couldn't let
you do that.

01:20:24.287 --> 01:20:26.956
Forget about it.
I've always wanted
to try the floor.

01:20:26.990 --> 01:20:29.859
Okay. I'm gonna need
a great, big pillow

01:20:29.893 --> 01:20:32.328
and a pair of those
fluffy, little pajamas,
the fluffier, the better.

01:20:32.361 --> 01:20:33.429
And do you have
one of those things

01:20:33.462 --> 01:20:34.530
that you go like that
and it turns the lights out?

01:20:34.563 --> 01:20:37.967
'Cause that's a little far
for me. I'll wait here.

01:20:38.902 --> 01:20:39.936
Sweet dreams.

01:20:41.370 --> 01:20:43.572
I want you to try to
get at least a B+
on your test,

01:20:43.606 --> 01:20:45.508
or I'm gonna be
very disappointed.

01:20:45.541 --> 01:20:47.010
I will, Aunt Sarah.
Okay.

01:20:47.043 --> 01:20:48.577
Bye.
Bye, honey.

01:20:48.611 --> 01:20:50.013
Bye, Aunt Sarah.
Love you.

01:20:50.046 --> 01:20:51.314
Oh, I love you, too.

01:20:53.016 --> 01:20:55.484
Bye, Dad.
Bye, Dad.

01:20:55.518 --> 01:20:58.554
Gee, one night out
of the house, and there goes
the good morning kiss.

01:20:59.688 --> 01:21:01.390
When did they start
calling you aunt?

01:21:01.424 --> 01:21:03.459
The day I got here.

01:21:03.492 --> 01:21:06.562
I didn't know that.
Sorry I used the bedroom.
I had to get dressed.

01:21:09.098 --> 01:21:11.467
So, did you get any writing
done last night?

01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:13.937
What if I told you
I finished?

01:21:13.970 --> 01:21:17.573
I did. The Beverly Hillbillies
stuff was fantastic.

01:21:17.606 --> 01:21:20.376
Every idea worked.
Every one.

01:21:20.409 --> 01:21:22.178
Well, I told you
not to worry.

01:21:22.211 --> 01:21:23.446
Well...

01:21:23.947 --> 01:21:25.414
(GROANS)

01:21:27.150 --> 01:21:29.919
I feel a little guilty.

01:21:29.953 --> 01:21:32.588
You look like you're
in pain. Meanwhile,
I slept like a dream.

01:21:34.190 --> 01:21:36.092
Don't worry about it.

01:21:36.125 --> 01:21:39.195
Well, if you'll
excuse me, I'm going to
go take a shower.

01:21:39.228 --> 01:21:40.563
Do you know where
the towels are?

01:21:40.596 --> 01:21:43.566
As a matter of fact,
I do.

01:21:43.599 --> 01:21:46.369
Well, the hot water's
a little slow to come on,
but don't worry, it'll come.

01:21:47.236 --> 01:21:48.504
We better fix that.

01:21:50.106 --> 01:21:52.175
Yes, we better.

01:21:52.208 --> 01:21:55.311
It's something
we got to do now.
We're going to fix it.

01:21:55.344 --> 01:21:58.247
That's what we're all about.

01:21:58.281 --> 01:22:00.984
Listen, honey, I know
you weren't crazy about
giving up the bedroom,

01:22:01.017 --> 01:22:03.252
but look how things
have worked out. You've
got a brilliant script.

01:22:03.286 --> 01:22:04.620
But I don't care.

01:22:04.653 --> 01:22:08.457
No script is worth me
not being able to share
the marital bed.

01:22:08.491 --> 01:22:10.059
We have to figure
something out.

01:22:10.093 --> 01:22:11.160
We'll think of something.

01:22:11.194 --> 01:22:11.995
(DOORBELL RINGING)

01:22:13.362 --> 01:22:15.731
Maybe it's
Marty Scorsese again.

01:22:15.764 --> 01:22:19.002
This time he's probably
doing a remake of
Taxi Driver with all women.

01:22:25.074 --> 01:22:26.309
Good morning.
May I help you?

01:22:26.342 --> 01:22:28.577
Are you Steven Phillips?
Yes.

01:22:28.611 --> 01:22:31.580
My name is Dr. Jacobson.
This is Nurse Rennert.

01:22:32.615 --> 01:22:34.150
May we come in, please?

01:22:34.183 --> 01:22:35.985
What is this in regard to?

01:22:36.019 --> 01:22:38.121
Do you have a Sarah Little
residing with you?

01:22:38.154 --> 01:22:39.222
What do you mean by
"residing"?

01:22:39.255 --> 01:22:41.490
Does Sarah Little live here?

01:22:41.524 --> 01:22:44.760
Well, she's staying with us,
if that's what you're asking.

01:22:44.793 --> 01:22:47.463
We need to talk to you.
Is there somewhere
we can sit down?

01:22:48.664 --> 01:22:50.099
Sit in here.

01:22:56.772 --> 01:22:58.174
What is it, honey?

01:22:59.675 --> 01:23:01.744
These people here
seem to know Sarah.

01:23:01.777 --> 01:23:03.579
Uh, will you please
sit down, ma'am?

01:23:07.316 --> 01:23:09.052
There's something
you two need to know.

01:23:10.086 --> 01:23:11.787
Miss Little is not well.

01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:13.789
Not well?
What do you mean,
"not well"?

01:23:13.822 --> 01:23:16.425
She lives in a sanitarium
outside Cincinnati.

01:23:16.459 --> 01:23:18.027
Have you heard of
the Breyerton Institute?

01:23:18.061 --> 01:23:19.228
No.

01:23:19.262 --> 01:23:20.796
That's where Sarah lives.

01:23:20.829 --> 01:23:25.234
And every few years,
she tends to run away.

01:23:25.268 --> 01:23:27.170
She doesn't seem to
appreciate her surroundings.

01:23:27.203 --> 01:23:28.804
The Breyerton Institute?

01:23:28.837 --> 01:23:34.243
She needs to be
on medication. She's
a multiple personality.

01:23:34.277 --> 01:23:38.447
Without her drugs,
she tends to act up.

01:23:38.481 --> 01:23:40.549
This is a joke, right?
You're joking.

01:23:40.583 --> 01:23:42.385
This isn't a joke.

01:23:42.418 --> 01:23:45.454
Whatever we do,
we can't seem to
keep her there.

01:23:45.488 --> 01:23:47.756
The last time she left,
she ran off to Paris.

01:23:49.625 --> 01:23:51.627
She claimed to be
Picasso's daughter.

01:23:51.660 --> 01:23:54.197
(LAUGHING)
Can you imagine?
And people believed her.

01:23:56.165 --> 01:23:59.202
Stupid people.

01:23:59.235 --> 01:24:02.438
But the Muse part,
though, is correct.
Yes? She is a Muse.

01:24:03.372 --> 01:24:04.707
A what?

01:24:04.740 --> 01:24:08.211
Sarah claims to be a Muse.
That's right, yes?

01:24:08.244 --> 01:24:09.312
(SNICKERING)
A Muse?

01:24:10.646 --> 01:24:12.415
(BOTH LAUGHING)

01:24:12.448 --> 01:24:13.616
There they go again.

01:24:15.451 --> 01:24:17.520
Well, that's
the best one yet.

01:24:17.553 --> 01:24:20.123
I love that.
Can you imagine?

01:24:20.156 --> 01:24:22.558
First Picasso's daughter,
then she's a Muse?

01:24:23.826 --> 01:24:26.362
I'm assuming this
laughing is a no?

01:24:26.395 --> 01:24:29.398
You have to hand it
to her, she's got
quite an imagination.

01:24:30.699 --> 01:24:32.668
Do you people
have credentials?

01:24:32.701 --> 01:24:33.802
(WHISPERING)
Maybe they're not
real doctors.

01:24:33.836 --> 01:24:36.305
What kind of credentials
would you expect us to have?

01:24:36.339 --> 01:24:39.142
I don't carry
my diploma with me.

01:24:39.175 --> 01:24:41.844
But I mean, you certainly
could have made a mistake.

01:24:41.877 --> 01:24:45.248
I make mistakes every day.
You made a mistake.
It's that simple.

01:24:45.281 --> 01:24:46.615
I've made
no mistake, sir.

01:24:46.649 --> 01:24:48.884
Mr. Phillips,
this is Hollywood.

01:24:48.917 --> 01:24:51.220
I wouldn't beat yourself up
that you believed her.

01:24:51.254 --> 01:24:53.889
People here
believe anything,
don't they?

01:24:53.922 --> 01:24:55.124
Well, um...

01:24:55.158 --> 01:24:57.726
If you don't mind,
I need to speak with Sarah.
Where is she?

01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:59.162
Um, actually,
she's not even here...

01:24:59.195 --> 01:25:00.663
She's in the shower.
No, no.

01:25:02.298 --> 01:25:03.532
You're not gonna hurt her,
are you?

01:25:03.566 --> 01:25:07.203
No, no, no.
We're gonna be
very gentle.

01:25:07.236 --> 01:25:11.340
But a multiple personality?
That's impossible.
We know her.

01:25:11.374 --> 01:25:14.410
She has one personality.

01:25:14.443 --> 01:25:15.778
It's a classic case.

01:25:17.913 --> 01:25:21.517
(LAUGHING) A Muse!
That is so funny.

01:25:23.286 --> 01:25:26.155
God, wait till I tell
the other doctors.

01:25:26.189 --> 01:25:28.424
Go with him.
He doesn't know
where the shower is.

01:25:29.858 --> 01:25:34.397
But the thing is, she has
all of these brilliant ideas.

01:25:34.430 --> 01:25:37.600
She fits the Muse
profile perfectly.

01:25:37.633 --> 01:25:40.236
I'm not going to
argue with you, sir.

01:25:40.269 --> 01:25:43.606
Nurse Rennert,
would you please come up
here immediately?

01:25:54.483 --> 01:25:56.619
Oh, my God.
Our best sheets.

01:25:58.254 --> 01:26:00.456
That is so low on our
problem scale right now.

01:26:01.457 --> 01:26:02.791
Now what do we do?

01:26:02.825 --> 01:26:05.228
I don't know. I don't think
I have the energy to
start looking again.

01:26:05.261 --> 01:26:06.929
I don't know what to do.

01:26:06.962 --> 01:26:08.431
(WHISPERING) Well,
as long as we are out here,

01:26:08.464 --> 01:26:10.399
maybe we should at least
see that Universal tour.

01:26:10.433 --> 01:26:11.434
We'll talk about
this privately.

01:26:15.504 --> 01:26:17.773
STEVEN: So, what do
you do now? Go after her?

01:26:17.806 --> 01:26:20.309
(SIGHS)

01:26:20.343 --> 01:26:24.213
I guess. You have to
understand, we have
other patients, too.

01:26:24.247 --> 01:26:27.583
There's just so much time
we can give to
these Sarah searches.

01:26:27.616 --> 01:26:30.853
The institute isn't a prison.
If she really wants to leave,
what can we do?

01:26:30.886 --> 01:26:32.488
Bye-bye.

01:26:32.521 --> 01:26:33.989
See you later.

01:26:34.022 --> 01:26:38.361
Oh, Nurse Rennert said
something earlier that
I thought was interesting.

01:26:38.661 --> 01:26:39.862
Yeah?

01:26:39.895 --> 01:26:41.930
Could you get us into
the Universal tour?

01:26:41.964 --> 01:26:43.299
(SCOFFS)

01:26:44.567 --> 01:26:45.901
So, then who was she?

01:26:46.835 --> 01:26:48.804
She was just a person.

01:26:48.837 --> 01:26:50.373
She wasn't a Muse?

01:26:50.406 --> 01:26:51.907
Apparently not, honey.

01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:54.543
Although according to Hal,
I'm going to sell
my new script

01:26:54.577 --> 01:26:57.513
faster than any one
I've ever written.

01:26:57.546 --> 01:27:00.249
And I'm going to open
my first store.

01:27:00.283 --> 01:27:02.351
Really?
A cookie store?

01:27:02.385 --> 01:27:05.621
Congratulations.
Where's the store gonna be?

01:27:05.654 --> 01:27:07.556
Sarah found me
a place on Robertson.

01:27:07.590 --> 01:27:10.593
It's a great location.
I can move in next month.

01:27:10.626 --> 01:27:13.462
Wow, you were using Sarah
as a real estate agent, huh?

01:27:13.496 --> 01:27:15.798
Gives a whole new meaning
to multiple listings.

01:27:15.831 --> 01:27:16.999
Can I work there, Mom?

01:27:17.032 --> 01:27:18.301
Yes, honey.

01:27:18.334 --> 01:27:19.668
Me, too?
Yes, honey.

01:27:20.303 --> 01:27:21.604
Me, too?

01:27:21.637 --> 01:27:22.605
(ALL LAUGHING)

01:27:34.383 --> 01:27:36.051
So, you think
he liked it?

01:27:36.084 --> 01:27:38.787
I heard him laughing
and laughing when
he was reading it.

01:27:38.821 --> 01:27:40.489
I think he loves it.

01:27:40.523 --> 01:27:42.491
Oh, that's great.
I'm very proud of this.

01:27:42.525 --> 01:27:44.327
(DOOR OPENING)

01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:47.496
Hey, Steven,
come on in.
No calls.

01:27:47.530 --> 01:27:49.365
Well, put the
important ones through.

01:27:49.398 --> 01:27:50.966
No, put them all through.

01:27:54.102 --> 01:27:55.538
Have a seat.

01:27:59.575 --> 01:28:02.010
All right.
I'm not going to
beat around the bush.

01:28:03.412 --> 01:28:05.614
Your script is brilliant.

01:28:05.648 --> 01:28:07.583
Well, thank you
very much, Josh.

01:28:07.616 --> 01:28:10.619
Coming from you,
that's quite a compliment.

01:28:10.653 --> 01:28:12.755
I'm very surprised
at your agent, though.

01:28:12.788 --> 01:28:14.723
Why?

01:28:14.757 --> 01:28:18.093
Why do you have me
read a script another
studio's planning to film?

01:28:18.126 --> 01:28:20.496
I'm sorry,
I didn't hear you.
What did you say?

01:28:20.529 --> 01:28:23.098
Yeah, I just found out
Universal's weeks away
from shooting this.

01:28:23.131 --> 01:28:25.067
Well, that's
not a possibility,
because I just wrote it.

01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:26.369
So, how could that be?

01:28:26.402 --> 01:28:28.337
Well, so did Rob Reiner.

01:28:28.371 --> 01:28:29.572
Rob Reiner?

01:28:30.873 --> 01:28:32.908
The Muse gave it
to Rob Reiner?

01:28:32.941 --> 01:28:34.643
The Muse?

01:28:34.677 --> 01:28:37.713
(STAMMERING)
We were at the...

01:28:37.746 --> 01:28:41.550
He was at the aquarium
with me. That's impossible.

01:28:41.584 --> 01:28:43.386
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:28:43.419 --> 01:28:47.523
I mean, it's not
the same idea.
It's not.

01:28:47.556 --> 01:28:50.125
I mean, there's lots of
movies that feel like
the same, but they're not.

01:28:50.158 --> 01:28:51.894
Remember Big?
You know, the Tom Hanks.

01:28:51.927 --> 01:28:53.028
Well, I mean, there were
like nine of those,

01:28:53.061 --> 01:28:54.930
but they were all different,
so that's the case here.

01:28:54.963 --> 01:28:57.966
Remember one guy got high,
and the other was small.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.935
And they all made money.
And this one's gonna
make money, too.

01:28:59.968 --> 01:29:01.370
It's got to be different.

01:29:01.404 --> 01:29:03.472
It's the same exact movie.

01:29:03.506 --> 01:29:05.908
They even got Jim Carrey,
just like you wanted.

01:29:05.941 --> 01:29:10.112
She took Jim Carrey?
She took my cast!

01:29:10.145 --> 01:29:12.014
This is against
the Writers Guild rules.

01:29:12.047 --> 01:29:14.116
You're not allowed
to do this.
This isn't fair.

01:29:14.149 --> 01:29:17.119
Nothing's fair, Steven.
That's what life is.

01:29:17.152 --> 01:29:18.421
Look, I have a great idea.

01:29:18.454 --> 01:29:20.723
Let's get the scripts
right now and read them
out loud together.

01:29:20.756 --> 01:29:22.658
We can order in and
just read out loud.

01:29:22.691 --> 01:29:23.726
And I'm sure they'll be
different, you'll see.

01:29:23.759 --> 01:29:25.828
We'll start with page one
and we can both read.

01:29:25.861 --> 01:29:28.163
And by page 10,
we're gonna go off
like a road.

01:29:28.196 --> 01:29:30.999
You're scaring me.
We're ending this
meeting right now.

01:29:31.033 --> 01:29:33.869
Why don't you take my advice
and head into that new career?

01:29:33.902 --> 01:29:35.771
Take a vacation.
Do something.

01:29:35.804 --> 01:29:39.074
It's very stressful to
write, and obviously
it's gotten to you.

01:29:39.107 --> 01:29:41.143
You know, there's a reason
writers don't live very long.

01:29:41.176 --> 01:29:44.079
Yeah, people like you.
Because you're the Devil!

01:29:44.112 --> 01:29:46.048
Why don't you
finally admit it?
Say it. "I'm the Devil."

01:29:46.081 --> 01:29:47.616
Say it. Fess up!

01:29:47.650 --> 01:29:49.151
Okay. I want you out
of my office right now.

01:29:49.184 --> 01:29:50.886
I don't want
to see you again.
Get out!

01:29:50.919 --> 01:29:52.855
I apologize about the devil
thing, it was wrong to say.

01:29:52.888 --> 01:29:55.190
But the point is,
is that the Muse
stole it from me!

01:29:55.223 --> 01:29:56.625
That's what I'm telling you.

01:29:56.659 --> 01:29:59.595
Oh, the Muse again.
The Devil and the Muse.

01:29:59.628 --> 01:30:02.130
Why don't you go write that?
Sounds like a
good buddy movie.

01:30:02.164 --> 01:30:04.800
Why would Rob Reiner be at
the aquarium? He's not
gonna go to the aquarium.

01:30:04.833 --> 01:30:06.769
He's got a lot to do.
I didn't want to go either.

01:30:06.802 --> 01:30:08.571
She says, "Let's go."
And she said the
same thing to him.

01:30:08.604 --> 01:30:10.205
And there he was,
and he waved.

01:30:10.238 --> 01:30:12.441
And you know what
I'm trying to tell you,
don't you?

01:30:12.475 --> 01:30:14.910
As a matter of fact, I do.

01:30:14.943 --> 01:30:16.712
We're gonna need
some help in here
immediately.

01:30:16.745 --> 01:30:20.616
It's my idea.
The Muse took it.
She stole it.

01:30:21.083 --> 01:30:24.119
The Muse. The Muse.

01:30:25.554 --> 01:30:28.691
The goddamn Muse.

01:30:31.794 --> 01:30:35.664
I want that one,
that one and that one.

01:30:35.698 --> 01:30:38.767
And by the way,
I didn't get a free sample.

01:30:38.801 --> 01:30:40.803
I want my free sample!

01:30:40.836 --> 01:30:43.572
I already gave you
a free sample.

01:30:43.606 --> 01:30:46.074
And if you ask me again,
I'm gonna unscrew your head

01:30:46.108 --> 01:30:47.375
and put it in
a cookie machine.

01:30:47.409 --> 01:30:50.245
Then you'll be part
of a cookie and
you can eat yourself!

01:30:50.278 --> 01:30:52.548
Be nice
to the customer.

01:30:52.581 --> 01:30:54.216
"Customer"?
Isn't the definition
of a customer

01:30:54.249 --> 01:30:55.918
at least somebody
over 10?

01:30:55.951 --> 01:30:58.921
I keep telling you,
I want another sample.

01:30:58.954 --> 01:31:00.489
That's it. One choke!

01:31:00.523 --> 01:31:01.990
Don't touch him.
We could get sued.

01:31:03.526 --> 01:31:04.660
She'll take care of you.

01:31:06.929 --> 01:31:08.531
If you need me,
I'll be out back.

01:31:08.564 --> 01:31:09.932
I'll be the one with
the gun in my mouth.

01:31:09.965 --> 01:31:12.768
Oh, Hal's on the phone.
He says it's important.

01:31:12.801 --> 01:31:15.571
What does he want,
raisins instead of nuts?

01:31:20.976 --> 01:31:22.010
Yes?

01:31:22.044 --> 01:31:23.679
Are you sitting down?

01:31:23.712 --> 01:31:26.682
No. You want me to
pull up a bag of flour?

01:31:26.715 --> 01:31:29.885
I got great news for you.
Your life is about to change.

01:31:29.918 --> 01:31:31.854
Paramount is going
to make your movie.

01:31:31.887 --> 01:31:33.656
What did you say?

01:31:33.689 --> 01:31:36.258
Paramount is going
to make your movie!

01:31:36.291 --> 01:31:38.160
Now, get over there
right away. They want to
have a creative meeting.

01:31:38.193 --> 01:31:40.095
They have a few problems,

01:31:40.128 --> 01:31:42.030
but they're not
worried about it.
They know you can fix it.

01:31:42.064 --> 01:31:44.232
Congratulations.
I told you this
was going to happen.

01:31:44.266 --> 01:31:45.968
But what about
the Rob Reiner picture?

01:31:46.001 --> 01:31:47.736
Aren't they worried
about that?

01:31:47.770 --> 01:31:49.605
Not going.
Universal pulled the plug.

01:31:49.638 --> 01:31:50.906
What happened?

01:31:50.939 --> 01:31:52.741
Who the hell cares?
Just get over to Paramount.

01:31:52.775 --> 01:31:54.543
It's your script
they're interested in.

01:31:54.577 --> 01:31:56.278
Oh, my God, Hal.

01:31:56.311 --> 01:32:00.115
You don't know
what's going on.
This call came just in time.

01:32:00.148 --> 01:32:00.949
Just get over there.

01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:19.935
Hi, Anne. I'm back.

01:32:19.968 --> 01:32:24.172
Congratulations.
The buzz around here
is wonderful.

01:32:24.206 --> 01:32:27.109
Thanks. Well, I'll tell you,
after the last meeting
with Josh,

01:32:27.142 --> 01:32:29.044
who would have ever
thought we'd be working
together again.

01:32:29.077 --> 01:32:30.713
I certainly didn't.

01:32:30.746 --> 01:32:33.849
Well, in fact, you're not.
Josh was let go last week.

01:32:33.882 --> 01:32:35.117
What?

01:32:35.150 --> 01:32:36.752
He was caught stealing.

01:32:36.785 --> 01:32:38.120
No.

01:32:38.153 --> 01:32:41.657
All that stuff
he liked to collect,
it belonged to other people.

01:32:41.690 --> 01:32:44.359
I knew something was
wrong with this guy.

01:32:44.392 --> 01:32:46.829
Don't worry about it.
You'll love Christine.
She's brilliant.

01:32:46.862 --> 01:32:48.631
Everyone loves
working with her.

01:32:48.664 --> 01:32:51.900
Anne, dear, have you
made a lunch reservation?
You're Steven?

01:32:51.934 --> 01:32:53.301
Oh, shit.

01:32:53.335 --> 01:32:56.739
I just loved your script.
Of course, it does
have a few problems.

01:32:56.772 --> 01:32:58.040
That aquarium thing
doesn't really work.

01:32:58.073 --> 01:33:00.175
But we'll fix that.
Anne, we'll be back
in about an hour.

01:33:00.208 --> 01:33:02.277
Let's go have
a nice, big lunch.

01:33:02.310 --> 01:33:04.680
I'm not really hungry.
Help!

01:33:04.713 --> 01:33:06.915
By the way,
I left my purse at home.

01:33:06.949 --> 01:33:08.383
You have plenty
of money on you.

01:33:08.416 --> 01:33:09.785
Huh?
Don't you?

01:33:11.419 --> 01:33:14.056
Money?
No more money!
