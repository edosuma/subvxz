WEBVTT

00:03.878 --> 00:07.464
Oh, I cannot believe that you didn't tell me
we are still married.

00:07.632 --> 00:09.383
Look, I was going to tell you.

00:09.551 --> 00:12.177
When? After the birth
of our first secret child?

00:13.930 --> 00:16.682
Ross didn't get the annulment.
We are still married.

00:16.850 --> 00:18.892
- You're kidding?
- Oh, my God.

00:20.729 --> 00:21.770
Ross.

00:21.938 --> 00:23.939
Okay, maybe it wasn't
my best decision...

00:24.107 --> 00:26.233
...but I couldn't face
another failed marriage.

00:26.651 --> 00:27.860
Let me just jump in and ask.

00:28.028 --> 00:31.071
At what point did you think
this was a successful marriage?

00:32.866 --> 00:37.369
Rach, come on. If you think about it,
it's actually kind of funny.

00:39.539 --> 00:41.874
Okay, maybe it's best
not to think about it.

00:43.126 --> 00:47.129
Oh, this is inexcusable.
I'm shocked to my very core.

00:48.923 --> 00:51.050
Phoebe, I told her you already knew.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.889
Another lie. You have a sickness.

00:59.309 --> 01:00.809
Ross, just for my own peace of mind...

01:00.977 --> 01:03.437
...you're not married
to any more of us, are you?

01:42.560 --> 01:44.019
Oh, hey, someone left their keys.

01:44.562 --> 01:47.606
Ooh, to a Porsche.

01:47.982 --> 01:50.609
- Hey, Gunther, are these yours?
- Yeah. That's what I drive.

01:52.237 --> 01:55.614
I make 4 bucks an hour.
I saved up for 350 years.

01:58.201 --> 01:59.409
Uh-uh.

02:01.746 --> 02:03.497
Hey, did anybody lose their keys?

02:03.665 --> 02:05.499
Why don't you put them
in the lost and found?

02:05.667 --> 02:07.501
There's a lost and found?

02:08.627 --> 02:10.253
My shoe!

02:11.673 --> 02:13.423
You left a shoe here?

02:13.591 --> 02:15.425
Well, I didn't realize till I got home.

02:15.593 --> 02:18.595
I wasn't gonna walk all the way
back down here with one shoe.

02:19.222 --> 02:22.891
I'm gonna go find that guy's car
and leave a note on the windshield.

02:23.059 --> 02:26.728
Oh, good. When he comes back for
his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe.

02:26.896 --> 02:28.355
Great. Thanks.

02:30.108 --> 02:32.734
Oh, good, good. You guys are here.
Listen.

02:32.902 --> 02:34.486
How would you like
to spend tomorrow...

02:34.654 --> 02:37.239
...taking care of three
incredibly cute little puppies?

02:37.407 --> 02:39.783
Oh, my God. What a fun day.
That sounds great.

02:39.951 --> 02:41.618
Yeah, all right.

02:41.786 --> 02:44.204
Okay, well, I'll bring them by
tomorrow morning.

02:44.372 --> 02:47.708
Okay, and by the way,
they're not actually puppies.

02:47.876 --> 02:50.419
They're Frank and Alice's triplets.
Okay, see you.

02:51.796 --> 02:52.921
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What?

02:53.298 --> 02:56.175
Please, please, please?
Frank and Alice...

02:56.342 --> 02:59.928
...asked me to babysit the triplets.
I'm nervous. I've never done that by myself.

03:00.096 --> 03:01.847
Don't worry about it, Phoebe. We'll do it.

03:02.015 --> 03:05.851
Yeah, I'm gonna pass, because I was
kind of iffy when it was puppies.

03:07.187 --> 03:10.814
Come on, Chandler. Come on,
it'll give us great practice for when...

03:10.982 --> 03:13.358
...people with babies come to visit.

03:18.072 --> 03:19.114
Nice car.

03:19.282 --> 03:21.491
Yeah, it's, uh... It's not mine.

03:23.453 --> 03:26.663
- I love your car.
- Yeah. It's mine.

03:28.208 --> 03:31.585
- I bet it's fast.
- Me too. Yeah.

03:31.753 --> 03:33.003
And comfortable.

03:33.171 --> 03:35.964
- Do you, uh, like leather seats?
- Yeah.

03:38.676 --> 03:39.760
It's got them.

03:43.932 --> 03:47.601
So I still have boxes here.

03:48.102 --> 03:50.479
I still have boxes at Ross'.

03:50.647 --> 03:52.648
And I have nowhere to live.

03:52.815 --> 03:55.525
Wow, I could so easily
freak out right now.

03:56.361 --> 03:57.444
What about me?

03:57.612 --> 04:01.114
I just found out Denise is leaving town
for a while. I don't have a roommate.

04:04.285 --> 04:08.080
Well, maybe I could be your roommate,
Pheebs.

04:09.290 --> 04:11.541
Maybe you could be my roommate.

04:12.210 --> 04:14.753
- Well, there's an idea.
- Yeah.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.213
- That would be great.
- Oh.

04:16.380 --> 04:20.050
- Wait, how long is Denise gone for?
- Um, she said she'd be back December 26th.

04:20.218 --> 04:22.219
Oh! December 26th.

04:22.387 --> 04:24.012
Heh, maybe she's Santa Claus.

04:30.186 --> 04:35.107
Oh, look who it is.
My husband, the apple of my eye.

04:35.817 --> 04:38.860
Okay, I got us a court date
for tomorrow at 2...

04:39.028 --> 04:41.405
...and I picked up all the forms.

04:41.572 --> 04:42.948
I'll take care of everything.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.450
Sure, if you say you're gonna
take care of everything...

04:45.618 --> 04:47.869
...I have no reason to doubt you.

04:48.037 --> 04:49.955
Give me those forms.

04:50.123 --> 04:53.792
All right, now, I'm gonna do this my way,
and I don't wanna hear a peep out of you.

04:53.960 --> 04:56.712
- Okay, Rach, but...
- Ah, you're peeping.

05:01.217 --> 05:02.718
Ross, you know what? I just got...

05:03.261 --> 05:05.554
- Why? Why did you do this?
- Look, I told you...

05:05.722 --> 05:08.265
I don't wanna hear
"three failed marriages."

05:08.433 --> 05:11.268
Look, if you'd had two failed marriages,
you'd understand.

05:11.436 --> 05:13.645
Well, you know what?
Thanks to you, I'm halfway there.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.149
Oh.

05:17.317 --> 05:21.570
Oh, I am so mad, Ross. I don't think
I've ever been this angry.

05:23.072 --> 05:25.240
What about the time I said
we were on a break?

05:25.408 --> 05:26.450
Oh.

05:32.957 --> 05:34.374
Pheebs, how's it going?

05:34.542 --> 05:37.627
I'm doing okay. Do you think they're
having fun? Am I talking too fast?

05:37.795 --> 05:39.171
No. You sound like me.

05:39.881 --> 05:43.633
It's going great. Look at Chandler
with Little Baby Girl Chandler.

05:44.385 --> 05:48.930
Little Baby Girl Chandler. Where have
I heard that before? Oh, right, Coach Rubin.

05:54.645 --> 05:55.687
You know what, Pheebs?

05:55.855 --> 05:59.399
When you're done over there,
we've got a kind of situation over here too.

06:00.234 --> 06:03.195
Uh-uh. No. We are all responsible
for our own babies.

06:03.363 --> 06:06.823
See, that's where I think you're wrong.
We've been playing them man-to-man.

06:06.991 --> 06:09.534
We should really be playing
a zone defense.

06:10.119 --> 06:11.161
What do you mean?

06:11.329 --> 06:12.996
I just think things will go smoother...

06:13.164 --> 06:17.042
...if we each have our own zone, you know?
Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping.

06:17.752 --> 06:19.669
And, Mon, you can be in charge
of diapering.

06:19.837 --> 06:24.049
And I can be in charge of looking at how
cute they are when they put their hands...

06:25.843 --> 06:28.595
That sounds really great,
but you should be in charge of wiping.

06:28.763 --> 06:31.681
Okay, I'm a rookie.
I should not be in the end zone.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.652
Wow, this is so great.

06:43.820 --> 06:46.696
This is exactly how we set the plates
at the restaurant.

06:47.532 --> 06:49.783
Yeah? Well, this is not what I ordered.

06:54.622 --> 06:55.747
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

06:55.915 --> 06:57.374
Hey, babies.

06:58.334 --> 06:59.543
I'm having the best morning.

06:59.710 --> 07:02.462
That, uh, Porsche I've got the keys to?
Still there.

07:02.630 --> 07:06.049
Shocking, since you still have the keys.

07:07.343 --> 07:10.470
You should see the treatment I get
when I'm with that car.

07:10.638 --> 07:14.141
People are friendly. They wanna talk.
And not just about the car.

07:14.308 --> 07:16.351
One guy advised me
on my equity investments.

07:16.561 --> 07:17.686
What equity investments?

07:17.854 --> 07:20.897
The ones that got me the Porsche.
Will you keep up?

07:24.902 --> 07:27.779
I figured, if people keep seeing me
just standing there...

07:27.947 --> 07:29.781
...they're gonna start to think
I don't own it.

07:29.949 --> 07:33.201
So I figure I'll wash it, right?
Monica, you got a bucket and some soap?

07:33.369 --> 07:36.121
Oh, yeah. I got soap
and sponges and rags...

07:36.289 --> 07:40.709
...and carnauba wax
and polishing compound.

07:41.335 --> 07:42.794
You don't even have a car.

07:43.212 --> 07:46.506
I know. But one time there was this
dirty car parked in front of the building...

07:46.674 --> 07:48.133
...so I washed it.

07:48.926 --> 07:51.553
- And?
- And six others.

07:51.721 --> 07:53.054
There you are.

07:56.601 --> 08:00.103
- Yeah, she tops out at 130.
- Wow.

08:00.646 --> 08:03.440
And that's just in the city.
I get her up to 160 upstate.

08:03.608 --> 08:06.026
Really? You got a place upstate?

08:06.736 --> 08:07.861
Sure.

08:09.614 --> 08:12.407
- Well, I'll see you later.
- Okay. Take it easy.

08:14.118 --> 08:16.828
Hey. That's my car.

08:17.413 --> 08:19.289
Really? Oh, uh...

08:19.457 --> 08:21.041
Just give me five more minutes.

08:22.793 --> 08:24.169
What are you doing?

08:24.337 --> 08:27.422
Well, I found the keys,
and now I'm just polishing her up.

08:28.132 --> 08:31.134
- But it's my car.
- Yeah, but it's my wax.

08:32.636 --> 08:35.429
Listen, I don't come to the city much.

08:35.597 --> 08:39.226
And I don't know if you're crazy
or if this is some kind of street theater...

08:39.684 --> 08:41.852
...but could I have my keys?

08:42.020 --> 08:45.190
Sure. Yeah. I'll save your parking spot.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.192
I'm not coming back.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.194
- Why not?
- I live upstate.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.321
Yeah, so did I.

08:53.741 --> 08:55.951
I don't know why I was so nervous
about this...

08:56.118 --> 08:59.287
...and I don't know why Frank and Alice
are always complaining. This is easy.

08:59.455 --> 09:02.082
Yeah, two hours, a lifetime,
that's the same.

09:04.001 --> 09:06.836
Check it out. Check it out.
When the babies wake up...

09:07.004 --> 09:08.838
...they can meet Krog.

09:11.259 --> 09:13.635
What are you doing?
That thing could put someone's eye out.

09:13.803 --> 09:17.347
He can do more than that.
He can destroy the universe.

09:17.765 --> 09:20.809
No, Chandler, they could swallow
one of those little parts.

09:20.977 --> 09:24.813
And also, look at his smooth area.
That's just gonna mess them up.

09:25.523 --> 09:28.525
They're not gonna swallow anything.
You're too overprotective.

09:28.693 --> 09:32.320
When I was a kid, my mom used to
just throw me into a pile of broken glass.

09:33.197 --> 09:36.491
- What?
- Glass, sand, whatever.

09:38.578 --> 09:41.204
Oh, look at little Leslie
stretching in her sleep.

09:41.372 --> 09:42.664
Oh, it's so cute.

09:42.832 --> 09:45.959
I wonder what age it is when you stop
putting both legs behind your head.

09:46.127 --> 09:47.210
Oh, I can still do that.

09:49.005 --> 09:51.298
How are you still single?

09:53.217 --> 09:56.177
All right, ahem. I thought about it,
and maybe you're right.

09:56.345 --> 09:57.887
Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.

09:58.055 --> 10:02.017
- Good. What made you change your mind?
- I swallowed his sonic blaster gun.

10:02.810 --> 10:04.603
How did that happen?

10:05.146 --> 10:07.731
Well, I was trying to prove
that I was right, you know?

10:07.898 --> 10:09.941
And it turns out I was wrong...

10:10.109 --> 10:12.360
...and now it's lodged in my throat.

10:16.741 --> 10:19.743
Damn it, this whole time we were
concentrating on the babies...

10:19.910 --> 10:22.454
...and no one was watching Chandler.

10:25.541 --> 10:28.043
Okay, you two are asking the court
for an annulment?

10:28.210 --> 10:31.338
Yes, Your Honor.
And here are our forms, all filled out.

10:31.505 --> 10:33.506
So based on your petition...

10:33.674 --> 10:36.593
...you are seeking an annulment
on the grounds...

10:36.761 --> 10:39.262
...that "Mr. Geller is mentally unstable."

10:42.433 --> 10:45.602
Fine. I'm mentally unstable.

10:45.770 --> 10:49.439
And based on the fact that "Mr. Geller
is an intravenous drug user."

10:50.691 --> 10:53.943
- What?
- Uh, yes. Heroin and crack.

10:55.946 --> 10:58.406
Crack isn't even an intravenous drug.

10:58.574 --> 11:00.075
Well, you would know.

11:02.078 --> 11:04.663
Now, it also says here that you:

11:04.830 --> 11:07.624
"Lied about your sexual preference
before marriage."

11:07.792 --> 11:11.419
- Oh, come on.
- Ross, please. I found the magazines.

11:13.297 --> 11:16.966
And, finally, that you were
"unable to consummate the marriage."

11:17.134 --> 11:20.845
Well, that makes sense since
you're gay and addicted to heroin.

11:22.431 --> 11:24.933
Okay, you know, I'm sorry,
this is insane.

11:25.101 --> 11:29.396
I'm not addicted to heroin,
I'm not gay, and there is no problem...

11:29.563 --> 11:31.314
...with my ability
to consummate anything.

11:31.482 --> 11:35.151
Look, I'll consummate this marriage
right here, right now.

11:36.487 --> 11:38.780
That won't be necessary.

11:39.156 --> 11:42.826
And when we were dating,
we consummated like bunnies.

11:43.452 --> 11:47.747
Now, if you two were involved in a serious
relationship, that really creates a problem.

11:47.915 --> 11:51.292
Your Honor, rest assured,
that relationship ended two years ago.

11:51.460 --> 11:54.587
And can you please strike "consummated
like bunnies" from the record.

11:55.506 --> 11:58.800
Is there anything in this record
that is actually true?

11:58.968 --> 12:02.262
Uh, well, yes. We got married in Vegas.

12:02.430 --> 12:05.306
And, uh, the names, I think.

12:05.766 --> 12:07.350
Well, based on what I've heard...

12:07.518 --> 12:09.894
...you two certainly don't qualify
for an annulment.

12:10.688 --> 12:13.523
If you don't wanna be together,
you'll have to file for divorce.

12:13.691 --> 12:18.111
That's great. You happy now? Look what
you did with your funny, funny form.

12:18.279 --> 12:22.657
What? Me? What about you and your
"consummated like bunnies" nonsense?

12:22.825 --> 12:25.827
And what...?
What are you typing that for?

12:25.995 --> 12:28.329
She already said
we don't get the annulment.

12:28.539 --> 12:30.540
Don't type that. What...?

12:30.708 --> 12:33.251
Stop typing. Hey.

12:33.419 --> 12:34.753
Stop typing.

12:35.379 --> 12:38.006
Stop typing, "stop typing."

12:38.174 --> 12:42.510
Okay, okay, do you see what you're
keeping me married to?

12:42.928 --> 12:44.429
You need to get out of my chambers.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.347
All right, lady, here's the deal.

12:46.515 --> 12:50.393
I came here for an annulment,
and I'm not leaving here until I get one.

12:50.561 --> 12:53.521
- Would you like to spend the night in jail?
- Thank you for your time.

13:16.504 --> 13:18.505
That Porsche guy took his car back.

13:21.634 --> 13:24.469
But you found the keys to his clothes?

13:25.846 --> 13:27.639
No, I just, uh...

13:27.807 --> 13:30.350
I love the way it feels when everybody
thinks I own a Porsche.

13:30.518 --> 13:33.019
People would think you own a Porsche
because of the clothes?

13:33.187 --> 13:34.687
Of course.

13:35.314 --> 13:38.858
Only an idiot would wear this stuff
if he didn't have the car.

13:41.862 --> 13:44.072
That is true.

13:45.032 --> 13:48.243
Yeah, but only a genius would
swallow a sonic blaster gun.

13:48.410 --> 13:50.286
Oh, I've been there.

13:52.623 --> 13:55.750
I am gonna go drive my Porsche.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.461
Joey, you know you don't
actually have one.

13:58.629 --> 14:02.799
Come on. What are you doing?
I'm in character. Will you talk to her?

14:04.385 --> 14:06.594
Ah, I think it just moved.
It's really poking me.

14:06.762 --> 14:08.805
That's it. We're going
to the emergency room.

14:08.973 --> 14:12.642
What? No, you can't leave me here
with them. We're babysitting.

14:12.810 --> 14:15.562
The babies are asleep.
I'm sure you'll be okay on your own.

14:15.729 --> 14:18.273
But you can't leave me with them.
We're a team.

14:18.440 --> 14:20.733
We're playing a zone.
They're gonna triple-team me.

14:22.111 --> 14:25.446
He's got something plastic in his throat.
We gotta go to the hospital.

14:25.781 --> 14:29.742
But, no, because a doctor won't be able to
help him. And it's just gonna, you know...

14:29.910 --> 14:33.037
...naturally pass through his system
in, like, seven years.

14:34.415 --> 14:37.292
- I think that's gum.
- I'm pretty sure it's gun.

14:39.128 --> 14:41.004
Okay, listen, this really hurts. Let's go.

14:41.171 --> 14:45.133
But no. A real man wouldn't
just run to the hospital.

14:45.301 --> 14:47.969
No. What would Krog do?

14:50.514 --> 14:54.183
Why isn't that valet back
with my Porsche?

14:55.603 --> 14:57.520
Maybe because you've got the keys?

15:03.110 --> 15:07.030
- That was totally your fault.
- My fault? You threatened the judge.

15:07.197 --> 15:10.116
Well, you ripped the paper out
of the court reporter's machine.

15:10.284 --> 15:12.368
That was the only way I could
get him to stop typing!

15:12.536 --> 15:13.703
Oh.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.289
Hi. How are the Gellers?

15:20.002 --> 15:23.379
Don't call us that.

15:23.923 --> 15:28.051
The judge wouldn't let us get an
annulment. Now we gotta get a divorce.

15:28.636 --> 15:31.095
Did a Porsche throw up on you?

15:34.391 --> 15:35.642
Hey.

15:35.809 --> 15:37.518
It's "Porsche."

15:38.938 --> 15:41.606
Me taking care of you
is no problem, huh?

15:41.774 --> 15:44.567
You guys feel safe, right?

15:44.735 --> 15:47.862
Okay, I'm gonna take that spit bubble
as a "Yeah, I do."

15:48.447 --> 15:52.659
Let's get rid of this dirty diaper, Leslie.
I'll set you up with a nice clean one.

15:53.035 --> 15:57.246
Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.
I just have to clean that up, okay?

15:57.414 --> 16:00.249
Because, let's face it, we're at Monica's.

16:01.919 --> 16:06.255
I broke it. All right.
Well, that's just the way things go.

16:06.423 --> 16:08.841
Okay. Good.

16:10.260 --> 16:12.178
Why are there only two of you?

16:12.346 --> 16:13.930
Where's Leslie?

16:14.098 --> 16:17.642
Well, you can't answer.
Leslie? Where are you, Leslie?

16:17.977 --> 16:20.937
Leslie, now would be a good time
for your first words.

16:23.607 --> 16:25.024
Well, look at you.

16:25.484 --> 16:26.693
Hey.

16:26.860 --> 16:31.239
You are a little bit mischievous.
My gosh.

16:31.407 --> 16:33.700
Oh, you're a lot mischievous.

16:35.661 --> 16:37.662
Well, it'll dry.

16:38.288 --> 16:41.207
Okay, you sit with your brother
and sister now...

16:41.375 --> 16:43.042
...who aren't there.

16:55.848 --> 16:58.266
- Hey.
- How do you feel?

16:58.434 --> 17:02.020
Well, let's just say that Krog will be
equipped to destroy the universe again...

17:02.187 --> 17:04.271
...in 12 to 14 hours.

17:05.816 --> 17:08.859
Okay, so I totally took care of the babies
all by myself.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.944
I fed them, bathed them
and put them to bed.

17:11.113 --> 17:13.990
And protected them from a tornado?

17:17.786 --> 17:18.869
Oh, my God.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.664
I know. The babies are asleep.

17:22.332 --> 17:24.416
Phoebe, what happened here?

17:24.585 --> 17:27.420
I did it. I took care
of the babies all by myself.

17:27.588 --> 17:31.716
- But my apartment.
- Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.

17:33.093 --> 17:34.427
But the mess.

17:34.595 --> 17:38.389
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe
took care of the babies all by herself.

17:39.725 --> 17:42.518
You're right. You're right,
I shouldn't freak out.

17:42.686 --> 17:44.687
This is what it's gonna be like
when we have babies.

17:44.855 --> 17:46.689
When will that be?

17:49.485 --> 17:51.903
Phoebe, would you take a look
at this mess?

17:59.495 --> 18:02.663
Oh, honey, thank God you're home.
I was getting worried.

18:04.208 --> 18:06.084
I picked up the divorce papers.

18:06.251 --> 18:12.006
Uh, I've already signed everything.
And I put little X's where you need to sign.

18:12.174 --> 18:14.967
Oh, little X's. Great.
That makes up for everything.

18:16.386 --> 18:20.765
You know, you've done
a lot of stupid stuff too, okay?

18:20.933 --> 18:23.810
Oh, name one stupid thing
that is as stupid as this one.

18:23.977 --> 18:26.521
Okay, how about you flew to London
to stop my wedding?

18:26.688 --> 18:29.482
How about you told me you loved me
after I was married?

18:29.650 --> 18:31.692
Wait a minute, that was different.

18:31.860 --> 18:34.362
I did those things
because I was in love with you.

18:34.530 --> 18:36.239
Yeah. Right.

18:39.451 --> 18:42.620
You're right. That's very different.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.997
So let's just sign the papers.

18:47.709 --> 18:50.419
- What?
- Nothing.

18:51.255 --> 18:53.548
Okay, can we just sign, please?

18:53.715 --> 18:55.341
Mm-hm.

19:05.644 --> 19:07.520
Congratulations.

19:07.688 --> 19:10.648
Okay, wait, Ross. Wait a minute. Um...

19:10.816 --> 19:14.026
I, uh, kind of have a little confession.

19:14.319 --> 19:15.695
What?

19:15.863 --> 19:18.614
Uh, well, you know,
this whole marriage thing.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.658
Kind of my idea.

19:21.702 --> 19:23.369
Excuse me?

19:23.537 --> 19:26.122
Remember how we were too drunk
to remember anything...

19:26.290 --> 19:27.832
...the night we were married?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.041
Yeah?

19:29.209 --> 19:32.211
And yeah,
I didn't really wanna say anything...

19:32.379 --> 19:35.131
...but it just kind of kept
coming back to me.

19:35.299 --> 19:37.133
Um, remember, we were in the casino...

19:37.301 --> 19:40.386
...and for some reason, you thought it'd
be funny to eat a lot of grapes.

19:41.263 --> 19:46.434
And I thought it would be funnier
if we got married.

19:46.602 --> 19:51.564
So, ahem, as a compromise, we decided
first to get married and then...

19:51.732 --> 19:54.275
...to eat a lot of grapes.
- To eat a lot of grapes.

19:56.486 --> 19:58.487
So, um...

19:58.655 --> 20:01.782
Sorry I got us into this whole thing.

20:02.534 --> 20:05.161
So then, I mean, if you think about it...

20:05.329 --> 20:08.080
...this is all your fault.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.959
Yeah, don't push it, though.

20:14.796 --> 20:16.505
I gotta say...

20:16.965 --> 20:19.425
...I know I divorce a lot of women.

20:22.804 --> 20:25.556
Never thought I'd be divorcing you.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.391
I know.

20:27.768 --> 20:31.646
I always thought if you and I got married,
that would be the one that stuck.

20:32.314 --> 20:34.982
And it wouldn't be a secret...

20:35.150 --> 20:37.526
...and we wouldn't have our
wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.

20:40.614 --> 20:42.323
Did I even treat?

20:42.491 --> 20:46.285
No, it was on the house.
It was a newlywed special.

20:46.995 --> 20:49.747
That may be the most depressing thing
I've heard in my life.

20:53.043 --> 20:55.461
Well, I should probably get these
to my lawyer's office.

20:56.505 --> 20:58.631
Hey, thanks, Ross,
for taking care of all this.

20:58.799 --> 21:01.300
- Ah, no problem.
- Yeah.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.770
- I'm gonna need a copy of those.
- Totally.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.230
Yeah.

21:19.653 --> 21:23.489
Hey, hey, hey.
Careful around my Porsche.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.451
- Hi, Joey.
- Hey.

21:27.619 --> 21:29.245
How you doing?

21:29.788 --> 21:32.373
He has the most amazing Porsche
under there.

21:32.541 --> 21:35.668
I'd love to show you, but I just tucked
her in. She's sleeping.

21:37.337 --> 21:39.422
Hey, would you two girls
like to go for a drink?
