00:00.531 --> 00:01.999
We found him this morning.

00:02.081 --> 00:03.869
Looks like he used to work here.

00:04.151 --> 00:06.819
We were opening up the drywall,
and Gary saw the arm.

00:07.017 --> 00:08.115
I was like, "What?"

00:08.173 --> 00:10.548
No way, Gary. That's not a dead body."

00:11.074 --> 00:12.611
Then Gary showed it to me.

00:12.853 --> 00:15.080
Turns out, it was a dead body.

00:16.007 --> 00:17.509
Who are you? Beyoncé?

00:17.886 --> 00:19.064
Selena.

00:19.298 --> 00:20.845
- Who?
- Selena.

00:20.972 --> 00:23.681
She was Beyoncé before Beyoncé.

00:25.083 --> 00:26.908
I thought you were J.Lo.

So, unfortunately,
the body we found

00:37.144 --> 00:38.619
was one of our employees.

00:39.468 --> 00:41.071
Salvatore Kazlauskas.

00:41.282 --> 00:43.259
Wait, you mean Creepy Sal?

00:43.361 --> 00:45.290
The man is dead.

00:45.692 --> 00:46.857
But yeah.

00:46.915 --> 00:48.681
- Oh.
- Phew.

00:49.517 --> 00:51.900
Police said he's been dead
for at least a year.

00:52.035 --> 00:53.108
Are you crying?

00:53.166 --> 00:54.369
Yeah, I just...

00:56.096 --> 00:57.619
But you didn't know him.

00:57.705 --> 00:59.309
But he was a human being.

00:59.762 --> 01:00.955
Ehh.

01:01.135 --> 01:02.968
Sal was a bit of a...

01:03.189 --> 01:04.357
How do I put it?

01:04.417 --> 01:07.283
When he looked at you,
it felt like he was grabbing you.

01:07.453 --> 01:10.689
Apparently he was doing
some work behind the drywall

01:10.747 --> 01:13.295
outside the women's washroom
and then his foot got caught

01:13.353 --> 01:15.330
in a beam, and he starved to death.

01:15.462 --> 01:18.968
I'm sorry,
what "work" was he doing exactly?

01:19.026 --> 01:20.415
We're not sure.

01:20.683 --> 01:23.322
He drilled a hole into
the women's washroom so...

01:23.380 --> 01:25.244
maybe he was hanging a picture?

01:25.619 --> 01:26.872
Dude.

01:26.941 --> 01:28.594
He was peeping on women
going to the potty.

01:28.651 --> 01:29.697
- What?
- Ew.

01:29.837 --> 01:30.876
Why?

01:30.945 --> 01:32.187
Well, that explains
the rotting smell

01:32.244 --> 01:33.512
in the women's bathroom.

01:33.581 --> 01:35.014
I know we all assumed
that was Amy.

of churn going on in there.

01:41.478 --> 01:43.217

- And anyway, um,

01:52.455 --> 01:53.623
Especially Sal's.

01:53.681 --> 01:56.856
Technically we've all been working next
Sal's dead body for the past year.

01:56.923 --> 01:58.422
Nobody complained until now.

01:58.480 --> 02:00.134
Oh, it just occurred to me.

02:00.384 --> 02:02.275
That must've been Sal's foot
we found.

02:02.408 --> 02:03.572
- Oh.
- No, no.

02:03.689 --> 02:05.421
Actually he still had
both of his feet.

So where am I
supposed to put thing?

16:58.085 --> 17:00.757
Well, where you normally put it.

17:00.919 --> 17:02.984
I guess I could put it on my lawn.

17:03.674 --> 17:04.772
I guess.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.001
Chuck, what are you doing?

17:06.140 --> 17:07.626
Did you get the hummus?

17:07.990 --> 17:09.124
Hummus?

17:10.529 --> 17:11.585
Put the body down!

17:11.671 --> 17:12.999
I was just doing
what you told me to do!

17:13.056 --> 17:14.171
What is wrong with you?

17:14.229 --> 17:16.042
- Okay, okay, okay!
- Back up!

17:16.101 --> 17:17.788
- You back up!
- You both back up.

17:17.846 --> 17:18.616
It's all right.

17:18.686 --> 17:21.538
Okay, if I rotate Jonah
on four-hour shifts,

17:21.616 --> 17:23.146
and I keep Kelly
on the loading dock,

17:23.204 --> 17:26.140
then I think I can make it so
that they never see each other.

17:26.289 --> 17:27.676
I don't feel so good.

17:27.819 --> 17:29.379
The candy corn is fusing itself

17:29.437 --> 17:30.613
back together in my stomach.

17:30.716 --> 17:31.982
Is that your second bag?

17:32.040 --> 17:33.554
- Mm-hmm.
- <i>Why did you lie to me?</i>

17:33.612 --> 17:35.313
<i>I don't know what
you're talking about, Kell</i> y!

17:35.370 --> 17:36.704
There's a 1% chance
they're talking

17:36.761 --> 17:37.761
about something else.

17:40.338 --> 17:42.072
Is this some kind of prank?

17:42.166 --> 17:43.507
Like, like, what?

17:43.651 --> 17:45.142
"Humiliate the new girl?"

17:45.205 --> 17:46.350
How could I humiliate you?

17:46.440 --> 17:47.620
I barely talk to you.

17:47.678 --> 17:48.757
Hey, guys.

17:48.815 --> 17:50.093
Why don't we take a breath?

17:50.151 --> 17:51.209
You know what, Kelly,

17:51.291 --> 17:52.763
I feel like
I cut your break short.

17:52.846 --> 17:54.563
Maybe you should go have
another bowl of ramen,

17:54.620 --> 17:56.154
- my treat.
- No, no, no, no.

17:56.212 --> 17:58.893
This guy's playing mind
games with me all day.

17:58.967 --> 18:00.730
I would never do that.

18:00.877 --> 18:01.917
I'm an ally.

18:02.057 --> 18:03.845
Then explain all those texts!

18:03.979 --> 18:06.713
I never texted you.

18:06.860 --> 18:08.337
Stop lying!

18:09.703 --> 18:11.937
- Whoa!
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:12.005 --> 18:13.839
- Okay, Kelly, just...
- Okay, Kelly.

18:13.897 --> 18:15.069
It was me. I did it.

18:15.127 --> 18:16.229
I took Jonah's phone,

18:16.323 --> 18:17.370
and I was messing around.

18:17.448 --> 18:18.710
And I accidently swiped right,

18:18.779 --> 18:20.053
and I just couldn't stop myself.

18:20.110 --> 18:21.469
And Garrett had something
to do with it too.

18:21.526 --> 18:23.181
- What?
- I-I mean mostly it was me.

18:23.257 --> 18:25.483
Just put the knife down, okay?
You're not going to hurt anyone.

18:25.549 --> 18:27.886
- Stop telling me what to do!
- Jonah!
