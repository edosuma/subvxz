WEBVTT

00:01.388 --> 00:04.323
I wonder if you can listen
to someone else get tortured,

00:04.325 --> 00:05.624
someone you care about.

00:05.626 --> 00:07.259
- Auggie!
- Tash?

00:07.261 --> 00:09.995
Belenko was targeting my unit.

00:09.997 --> 00:13.265
There's one guy still alive--
James Deckard.

00:13.267 --> 00:14.867
I've been reading up
about you, you know.

00:14.869 --> 00:16.469
You were suspended
from the CIA recently.

00:17.471 --> 00:19.238
Something
about a heart condition.

00:19.240 --> 00:21.206
You want to go back
and get Belenko, don't you?

00:21.208 --> 00:23.375
- I love you.
- I love you too.

00:23.377 --> 00:25.477
Annie, I know
you don't work for us anymore,

00:25.479 --> 00:28.513
but it would be helpful if you
could capture Belenko alive.

00:31.619 --> 00:34.019
Annie.

00:34.021 --> 00:35.320
That is a message.

00:35.322 --> 00:37.356
The Russians want me.

00:37.358 --> 00:40.025
We have other angles to work
in the meantime, such as Langer.

00:40.027 --> 00:41.026
He was working for Belenko.

00:44.365 --> 00:45.631
What happened?

00:45.633 --> 00:47.532
She was shot, fell through
a window trying to escape.

00:47.534 --> 00:48.534
Excuse me.

00:48.535 --> 00:49.535
The ballistics are back.

00:49.536 --> 00:50.536
It was Allen Langer.

00:50.537 --> 00:51.537
Belenko's guy.

00:51.538 --> 00:52.671
Security camera places him

00:52.673 --> 00:55.073
in West Virginia
less than three hours ago.

00:55.075 --> 00:57.376
I want a search team
scrambled, stat.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:24.939 --> 01:26.538
Delta team, go around.

01:33.213 --> 01:35.681
Sir, sir, go back in your house.

02:03.377 --> 02:07.713
Sir, down the stairs!
Down the stairs!

02:46.787 --> 02:48.286
Target is headed east
out of the building.

02:48.288 --> 02:50.288
Alpha team, pursue. Delta team,
come in from the south side.

02:50.290 --> 02:51.323
We got this.

02:51.325 --> 02:53.025
Langer!

03:04.304 --> 03:07.606
Webb, search the building.

03:07.608 --> 03:09.674
Do you see him?

03:16.417 --> 03:19.151
Where is he?

03:19.153 --> 03:21.186
- You lost him?
- Yeah.

03:21.188 --> 03:23.588
Langer did his counter-pursuit
training at Camp Peary.

03:23.590 --> 03:24.823
He knew our moves.

03:24.825 --> 03:26.291
Buenos Aires--where we at?

03:26.293 --> 03:27.793
Auggie and Deckard
are on their way home

03:27.795 --> 03:29.561
via secure CIA transport.

03:29.563 --> 03:31.096
Okay, Annie and McQuaid?

03:31.098 --> 03:33.832
Last we heard, they may have
Belenko in their custody.

03:57.825 --> 03:59.591
Cell service is still cut.

03:59.593 --> 04:02.160
No sign of the Vega force
since they executed the chief.

04:02.162 --> 04:03.428
That's typical Vega tactics.

04:03.430 --> 04:05.163
Just trying to control
the battleground.

04:05.165 --> 04:06.731
Battleground?

04:06.733 --> 04:08.667
These men move like ghosts.

04:08.669 --> 04:10.569
The Russians
pay them very handsomely

04:10.571 --> 04:12.337
to hunt humans like animals.

04:12.339 --> 04:13.738
They work in threes.

04:16.442 --> 04:17.676
I'm thinking
that we need to

04:17.678 --> 04:21.779
barter this guy
for safe passage.

04:21.781 --> 04:23.115
We already have this SIM card.

04:23.117 --> 04:24.182
I know it's not everything,

04:24.184 --> 04:25.584
but the CIA
should be happy with that,

04:25.586 --> 04:27.319
and he is just gonna
slow us down.

04:27.321 --> 04:29.421
You still won't be
fast enough.

04:29.423 --> 04:30.423
Listen to me.

04:30.424 --> 04:32.491
Why does Russia
want you dead now?

04:32.493 --> 04:35.127
I came from nothing,
and the only way

04:35.129 --> 04:38.830
to go from nothing
to power is through leverage.

04:38.832 --> 04:41.867
I know everything--everything
about how the FSB works,

04:41.869 --> 04:43.802
their infrastructure.

04:43.804 --> 04:45.370
Now,

04:45.372 --> 04:47.706
you're going to keep me alive
for the very same reasons

04:47.708 --> 04:49.608
that the Russians
want to kill me.

04:53.614 --> 04:55.447
I know bringing him along
makes our life much harder,

04:55.449 --> 04:57.883
but if Russia sent their best
to silence him,

04:57.885 --> 05:00.619
he is better than any SIM card.

05:00.621 --> 05:06.725
The intelligence angle
is to keep him alive.

05:06.727 --> 05:08.160
Okay, then we keep him alive.

05:08.162 --> 05:09.362
I still have my universal key.

05:09.363 --> 05:10.595
We'll find a car,

05:10.597 --> 05:12.631
and we'll drive like hell
to the U.S. embassy.

05:12.632 --> 05:14.666
Sound like a plan?
Yeah.

05:19.573 --> 05:20.839
Search the grid.

05:20.841 --> 05:22.941
See what you can pick up
through ambient SIGINT.

05:22.943 --> 05:26.878
Anything from the FBI
regarding Natasha's status?

05:26.880 --> 05:29.181
Well, call Bill Butler at ICE
and tell him that I'm gonna

05:29.183 --> 05:31.416
make his life a living hell
if she isn't on a plane

05:31.418 --> 05:33.585
to D.C. by Tuesday.

05:33.587 --> 05:36.821
Yeah, thanks.

05:36.823 --> 05:38.924
So this Natasha
went through all that shit,

05:38.926 --> 05:40.492
and they can't get her immunity?

05:40.494 --> 05:41.726
It's gonna happen.

05:41.728 --> 05:43.962
It's just your basic
bureaucratic bullshit.

05:43.964 --> 05:47.966
Yeah, well,
Langley's a one-way street.

05:47.968 --> 05:49.601
So what's the deal with you two?

05:49.603 --> 05:53.505
Like, you in a relationship
or something?

05:53.507 --> 05:54.973
It's complicated.

05:54.975 --> 05:57.576
Her getting kidnapped
and tortured in order

05:57.578 --> 06:00.445
to get information out of you
is more than complicated.

06:03.217 --> 06:06.251
She started as an Op.

06:06.253 --> 06:08.320
It became more, but the Agency
always got in the way.

06:08.322 --> 06:09.654
Shocker.

06:09.656 --> 06:11.790
I'm sure she has a few
choice words about the Agency.

06:11.792 --> 06:14.626
Yeah.

06:14.628 --> 06:18.630
That is putting it mildly.
I get it, though.

06:18.632 --> 06:22.601
The Agency's hard to understand
for anyone on the outside.

06:22.603 --> 06:24.369
But that's the life, right?

06:24.371 --> 06:27.806
Doesn't have to be.

06:27.808 --> 06:32.244
Look, I've been Agency-free
for nine years, brother.

06:32.246 --> 06:33.712
The grass is greener
than you think.

06:33.714 --> 06:34.913
Come on, hasn't it been hard

06:34.915 --> 06:38.717
just walking away
from your life?

06:38.719 --> 06:41.519
Walking away was easy.

06:41.521 --> 06:43.822
Coming back is hard.

06:58.305 --> 06:59.271
How about that one?

07:03.343 --> 07:04.476
Yeah.

07:19.993 --> 07:21.593
That's the Vega force.

07:21.595 --> 07:23.662
Sniper's up there.

07:23.664 --> 07:24.780
You think
you can take him out?

07:24.781 --> 07:25.897
I highly doubt it.

07:25.899 --> 07:27.532
- You don't talk.
- We need to create a cover.

07:33.774 --> 07:36.341
I got an idea.

07:40.347 --> 07:42.580
Go!

07:51.892 --> 07:54.059
Okay, that will work
for a smoke screen.

07:54.061 --> 07:55.527
Stay back!

07:55.529 --> 07:58.363
Okay, once he stops shooting,
we make a charge.

07:58.365 --> 08:00.332
But if we're gonna do this,
we have to be all in together,

08:00.334 --> 08:04.703
no matter what happens.

08:04.705 --> 08:06.471
What?

08:06.473 --> 08:10.408
If we make it out of this,
how about we get married?

08:10.410 --> 08:11.910
Seriously?

08:11.912 --> 08:13.712
Absolutely.

08:17.384 --> 08:19.451
You ready?

08:19.453 --> 08:21.419
Go.

08:25.474 --> 08:29.474

08:45.746 --> 08:47.712
Clear.

08:50.884 --> 08:53.418
One down.

09:00.494 --> 09:01.760
Grenades?

09:01.762 --> 09:05.029
These guys treat everything
like it's a war zone.

09:09.836 --> 09:11.870
He says they're going south

09:11.872 --> 09:14.773
towards Calle Cuatro.

09:14.775 --> 09:16.908
That's close to here.

09:16.910 --> 09:18.877
We need to go on offense
if we're gonna get out of this,

09:18.879 --> 09:21.746
so I say that we go fishing
for assassins.

09:25.752 --> 09:28.620
Going right there.
Thank you.

09:28.622 --> 09:32.490
Since when did the party chair
weigh in on security contracts?

09:32.492 --> 09:34.492
It's nice to meet you
in person, Arthur.

09:34.494 --> 09:38.563
But we are here to discuss
something far more important

09:38.565 --> 09:40.098
than security contracts.

09:40.100 --> 09:43.067
Well, your reputation
precedes you, Ms. Coughlin.

09:43.069 --> 09:45.203
Yes, it does.

09:45.205 --> 09:47.071
Arthur, Senator Pierson
is stepping down

09:47.073 --> 09:48.173
at the end of her term.

09:48.175 --> 09:50.442
I'm sorry to hear that.

09:50.444 --> 09:53.511
As you are from
Claire's home state of Maryland,

09:53.513 --> 09:55.046
there's going to be a vacancy.

09:55.048 --> 09:57.715
The party would like you
to consider a run.

09:57.717 --> 09:59.184
For Senate?

09:59.186 --> 10:01.486
It may feel like a big swing,

10:01.488 --> 10:03.021
but we believe
you have a good chance,

10:03.023 --> 10:06.024
especially with our backing.

10:06.026 --> 10:08.726
Explain "backing,"
because it--

10:08.728 --> 10:11.129
it can mean
a few different things.

10:11.131 --> 10:14.165
Major commitment from
major donors, super-PAC funding,

10:14.167 --> 10:18.703
of course--but you're
used to doing things off-book.

10:18.705 --> 10:20.004
Why me?

10:20.006 --> 10:21.773
Your resume
speaks for itself--

10:21.775 --> 10:27.946
Navy, CIA,
the private sector, family man.

10:27.948 --> 10:29.814
The world thinks
I resigned from the CIA

10:29.816 --> 10:31.015
because of an affair.

10:31.017 --> 10:32.617
Yes.

10:32.619 --> 10:35.220
Joan would be a key player
by your side.

10:35.222 --> 10:38.122
She's a strong female
role model.

10:38.124 --> 10:39.524
I'm honored.

10:43.163 --> 10:46.664
But a political campaign
is a microscope.

10:49.503 --> 10:51.803
I don't know if I want
to put my family through that.

11:00.914 --> 11:04.082
Sorry, visiting hours
haven't started yet.

11:04.084 --> 11:05.984
Okay, I need to get to work.

11:05.986 --> 11:07.752
Can I just sit with her now
for a bit?

11:07.754 --> 11:09.554
Family only.
Are you related?

11:14.261 --> 11:16.194
I'll come back.

11:24.538 --> 11:26.304
Welcome back, Auggie.

11:29.976 --> 11:32.677
Welcome back, Auggie.

11:32.679 --> 11:34.879
Yeah, thanks, Joan.
Anything yet?

11:34.881 --> 11:36.147
No, nothing concrete,

11:36.149 --> 11:38.783
but there's a pretty widespread
cell outage in Villa 31.

11:38.785 --> 11:40.118
We need to get
an immediate ground search party

11:40.120 --> 11:41.319
in that vicinity.

11:41.321 --> 11:43.321
We don't have that capability
in Argentina.

11:43.323 --> 11:44.722
We have an embassy there,
right?

11:44.724 --> 11:47.191
They've got bulletproof-glass
vehicles, right?

11:47.193 --> 11:49.327
Get some guys driving
around the neighborhood.

11:49.329 --> 11:53.197
Put a call in
to the ambassador right now.

11:53.199 --> 11:55.199
Hey, wait.

11:55.201 --> 11:57.835
Also, put a vehicle
outside Recoleta cemetery.

11:57.837 --> 12:00.004
That's pretty far
south of the slum.

12:00.006 --> 12:01.272
Just do it.

12:30.670 --> 12:32.937
Radio check.

12:32.939 --> 12:34.806
Check.
Rooftops clear.

12:34.808 --> 12:36.341
Last communication
between the Vegas

12:36.343 --> 12:37.642
had one of them in the area,

12:37.644 --> 12:39.277
the other on the far side
of the Villa.

12:39.279 --> 12:40.812
I wish there was another way
to do this.

12:40.814 --> 12:42.847
The only way out is through.

12:42.849 --> 12:45.950
We're not gonna
let Belenko get killed.

12:47.087 --> 12:49.821
Thank you for going along
with this.

12:49.823 --> 12:51.055
When I told you I'd help you,

12:51.057 --> 12:52.390
I meant it.

12:52.392 --> 12:55.960
We made this decision together--
all in.

12:56.997 --> 12:58.663
I got eyes.

12:58.665 --> 13:01.132
Northwest, heading northeast
towards Belenko.

13:01.134 --> 13:05.903
Should be on him
in three, two...

13:08.141 --> 13:10.241
Annie, behind you!

13:51.718 --> 13:53.151
They must have signaled
a coordinated retreat.

13:53.153 --> 13:54.452
Belenko's gone.

13:54.454 --> 13:57.955
You take that alley.
I'll take this one.

14:18.812 --> 14:21.245
Belenko!

14:21.247 --> 14:22.947
That's far enough.

14:22.949 --> 14:24.749
There you are.

14:24.751 --> 14:26.250
There's no need for that.

14:48.431 --> 14:51.065
Walker, do you copy?

14:57.406 --> 15:00.074
Walker, come in.

15:03.112 --> 15:05.412
Walker, do you copy?

15:53.295 --> 15:55.662
Why'd you save me?

15:55.664 --> 15:59.433
You gave us
quite the scare there.

15:59.435 --> 16:01.301
The first time we met,

16:01.303 --> 16:04.438
I mentioned that Chinese proverb
to you about saving your life.

16:04.440 --> 16:08.208
I wonder what the Chinese word
for "twice" is.

16:08.210 --> 16:09.843
<i>Leong tse.</i>

16:12.548 --> 16:15.149
You didn't answer my question.

16:15.151 --> 16:17.351
<i>Puedo?</i>

16:20.556 --> 16:23.223
Why did I save you?

16:23.225 --> 16:25.526
Because the Russians
are smart and ruthless,

16:25.528 --> 16:28.195
and they want me dead.

16:28.197 --> 16:30.931
You're the only friend
I have right now.

16:32.835 --> 16:36.336
I'm not your friend.

16:36.338 --> 16:37.437
It's too strong a word?

16:37.439 --> 16:39.506
Okay.

16:39.508 --> 16:42.609
The enemy of my enemy
is my friend.

16:44.613 --> 16:47.681
- Who's this family?
- I'm a diplomat.

16:47.683 --> 16:50.284
I'm very good at convincing
people to do things.

16:50.286 --> 16:54.454
I convinced them
to help me save you.

16:54.456 --> 16:56.690
Oh, you don't have
to thank me right now.

16:56.692 --> 16:58.692
Let it marinate.

17:16.412 --> 17:18.512
Auggie, a few things--

17:18.513 --> 17:21.448
one, a message
from Bill Butler at ICE.

17:21.450 --> 17:23.517
He too chicken to talk to me
on the phone? Call him back.

17:23.519 --> 17:25.618
He says
they're putting Natasha

17:25.621 --> 17:28.321
on a flight this afternoon--

17:28.324 --> 17:30.524
full immunity, no conditions.

17:34.863 --> 17:36.296
All right, thanks, Linda.

17:36.298 --> 17:39.233
Listen, I'm gonna
need real-time data analysis

17:39.235 --> 17:41.702
on the Buenos Aires PD.

17:41.704 --> 17:42.869
You don't want
to talk to Natasha?

17:42.871 --> 17:44.504
Excuse me?

17:44.506 --> 17:46.473
That's the other thing.
She's on line two.

17:46.475 --> 17:50.577
You kind of buried the lede
there, Linda.

17:50.579 --> 17:51.878
Hey.

17:51.880 --> 17:54.448
So good to hear your voice.

17:54.450 --> 17:57.818
Same here.

17:57.820 --> 18:02.789
So I'll be in the states
by 4:00 today,

18:02.791 --> 18:05.459
and I'm not sure
where I'm staying--

18:05.461 --> 18:08.895
No, you come
to my apartment.

18:08.897 --> 18:10.464
Okay.

18:10.466 --> 18:12.699
But the only thing is,
I may not be home by then.

18:12.701 --> 18:15.936
We're in the middle
of a work crisis here.

18:15.938 --> 18:19.773
It has to do with everything
we've been dealing with.

18:19.775 --> 18:21.441
I hear you.

18:21.443 --> 18:24.444
Okay, I'll see you soon.

18:32.588 --> 18:35.455
We've got embassy vehicles
canvassing Villa 31.

18:35.457 --> 18:37.691
No visuals on Annie, McQuaid,
or Belenko,

18:37.693 --> 18:39.726
but there's been reports
of gunfire.

18:39.728 --> 18:41.528
I also heard from Maxim Gomelsky

18:41.530 --> 18:44.364
that the FSB has deployed
a Vega force unit to Argentina.

18:44.366 --> 18:45.866
Jesus.

18:45.868 --> 18:47.467
Who do we have in the area?

18:47.469 --> 18:49.836
There's not a ton of need
for paramilitary in Argentina,

18:49.838 --> 18:51.605
and even if there were,
we can't send soldiers in.

18:51.607 --> 18:54.408
Russia did.

18:54.410 --> 18:55.976
Hey, Joe.

18:55.978 --> 18:58.011
We're just going over
the situation in B.A.

18:58.013 --> 18:59.013
I heard the rumors.

18:59.014 --> 19:01.715
DCS wandering the halls
in a T-shirt.

19:01.717 --> 19:03.450
Didn't think
they were actually true, but--

19:03.452 --> 19:04.818
Just came in
from West Virginia.

19:04.820 --> 19:06.687
So you're running
tactical missions now?

19:06.689 --> 19:09.456
I'm taking initiative.

19:09.458 --> 19:11.925
We have a potential windfall
in Aleksandre Belenko

19:11.927 --> 19:13.460
within our reach
in Buenos Aires,

19:13.462 --> 19:16.863
and you're going after
some low-level black bagger?

19:16.865 --> 19:18.565
Allen Langer is not low level.

19:18.567 --> 19:19.566
He's in league with Belenko.

19:19.568 --> 19:20.867
Belenko kills by proxy.

19:20.869 --> 19:22.336
Langer is a threat.

19:22.338 --> 19:27.341
Who also happened to put
your girlfriend in the hospital.

19:27.343 --> 19:29.009
What's this about, Joe?

19:29.011 --> 19:30.577
Leadership.

19:30.579 --> 19:32.346
Priorities.

19:32.348 --> 19:35.782
Stephanie Banks
got us the Intel

19:35.784 --> 19:37.718
that led us to Belenko.

19:37.720 --> 19:39.853
She is now fighting
for her life.

19:39.855 --> 19:42.656
We owe it to her, and we owe it
to all of our assets

19:42.658 --> 19:45.959
to prove that the CIA will
hold up its end of the bargain.

19:47.529 --> 19:48.895
That's leadership.

19:51.633 --> 19:52.999
Put your suit back on.

19:58.607 --> 20:00.607
Didn't expect that from you.

20:00.609 --> 20:02.142
He was being a dick.

20:02.144 --> 20:06.012
Besides, I know
you're gonna get the job done.

20:13.088 --> 20:15.021
We should go.

20:15.023 --> 20:17.557
You want to go back out there?

20:17.559 --> 20:21.895
It's not gonna take long
for that Vega force to find us.

20:21.897 --> 20:23.930
My gun?

20:23.932 --> 20:27.868
Hey, you saved me.
Now let me help save you.

20:34.977 --> 20:37.010
When this is over,
you are gonna help us.

20:37.012 --> 20:38.612
You sound confident.

20:38.614 --> 20:40.714
If the Russians don't
kill you, your condition will.

20:40.716 --> 20:42.048
You don't have much time left.

20:42.050 --> 20:44.117
You don't want
to spend it running like this.

20:56.165 --> 20:57.197
I almost shot you.

20:57.199 --> 20:59.900
I'm sure glad you didn't.

21:12.348 --> 21:13.814
How'd you find us?

21:13.816 --> 21:15.315
High school Spanish
and a fistful of cash.

21:16.685 --> 21:18.952
Best guess is that the Vegas
are headed to the north side

21:18.954 --> 21:20.587
near the container yard.

21:20.589 --> 21:23.657
Then we should go south
towards Recoleta cemetery.

21:23.659 --> 21:26.426
Auggie might send
a vehicle there.

21:26.428 --> 21:27.794
Why do you think that?

21:27.796 --> 21:29.429
Well, I've worked with him
for five years.

21:29.431 --> 21:31.832
He tends to pick places
with multiple egress options,

21:31.834 --> 21:34.635
plus he mentioned it.

21:37.406 --> 21:39.539
Recoleta's not far from here.

21:42.311 --> 21:44.778
Did you guys hear
Hollman cancelled poker night?

21:44.780 --> 21:46.613
What's going on, you think?

21:46.615 --> 21:48.682
Big situation in B.A.

21:48.684 --> 21:51.618
DPD is in full-court press mode.

21:51.620 --> 21:53.787
I got to jet.

23:54.777 --> 23:56.443
Sir, this is FSO Bracken.

23:56.445 --> 23:58.011
Bracken, talk to me.

23:58.013 --> 23:59.713
I'm just wondering, sir,

23:59.715 --> 24:01.915
should we continue this canvass
in the same way?

24:01.917 --> 24:04.117
We've been driving around
like you ordered,

24:04.119 --> 24:06.720
but we're kind of
flying blind here.

24:06.722 --> 24:09.122
You and me both.

24:09.124 --> 24:10.490
Sorry, sir?

24:10.492 --> 24:11.492
Don't be.

24:11.493 --> 24:12.959
Just keep
canvassing in that area.

24:12.961 --> 24:15.662
The second I have more Intel,
you'll be the first to know.

24:21.603 --> 24:24.171
I'll meet you there.

24:24.173 --> 24:27.674
Auggie.

24:27.676 --> 24:28.909
I know you're frustrated,
but we're gonna--

24:28.911 --> 24:30.977
Frustrated?

24:34.082 --> 24:37.484
Annie's been out of pocket
too long.

24:37.486 --> 24:38.585
If she gets through this,

24:38.587 --> 24:42.489
we owe it to her
to find her something here.

24:42.491 --> 24:43.824
I can try to help her.

24:43.826 --> 24:46.593
I can talk to the DCI, but she
has to want to come back.

24:49.731 --> 24:50.731
Yeah.

24:59.608 --> 25:00.608
Anderson?

25:00.609 --> 25:02.576
Who's asking?

25:02.578 --> 25:04.110
I'm Jones from polygraph.

25:04.112 --> 25:05.579
Deckard's down there now.

25:05.581 --> 25:06.613
The polygrapher wanted to know

25:06.615 --> 25:08.949
if you wanted to be there
with him.

25:08.951 --> 25:10.884
Polygraph--
why is he being polygraphed?

25:10.886 --> 25:12.853
Hey,
I'm just the messenger, man.

25:12.855 --> 25:15.121
All right, let's go.

25:15.123 --> 25:17.757
Linda.
Yep?

25:17.759 --> 25:20.260
It's gonna take me ten minutes
tops to clear this up.

25:20.262 --> 25:22.929
If Annie calls, find me.

25:22.931 --> 25:25.131
Okay.

25:27.669 --> 25:30.070
Am I the only one
who sees this situation

25:30.072 --> 25:31.072
as dripping with irony?

25:31.073 --> 25:33.874
I don't see Auggie's guy.

25:33.876 --> 25:36.142
There's another gate up here.

25:44.853 --> 25:46.520
It's just ahead.

26:03.739 --> 26:05.005
There.

26:08.010 --> 26:11.711
I told you Auggie
would send somebody here.

26:25.628 --> 26:28.662
Think we can make it?

26:28.664 --> 26:30.330
They'll be watching the SUV.

26:30.332 --> 26:32.366
We can't make
a direct approach.

27:22.284 --> 27:24.118
Ryan!

27:30.292 --> 27:31.658
This way?
Yeah.

27:53.682 --> 27:55.449
One more to go.

28:07.796 --> 28:09.796
We can make it.

28:26.549 --> 28:27.881
He's got position.
We're sitting ducks.

28:27.883 --> 28:30.250
If we give him up now,
we can save ourselves.

28:30.252 --> 28:31.785
I'm sorry, Annie.
No, we are almost there.

28:31.787 --> 28:32.787
We're so close.

28:32.788 --> 28:33.788
He is a deadweight.

28:33.789 --> 28:36.690
He's gonna get us killed.

28:36.692 --> 28:39.927
Maybe he can help us.

28:42.698 --> 28:46.433
Say "25-3" in clipped Russian,
or we're all dead.

28:52.942 --> 28:54.942
Do it again.

29:07.256 --> 29:09.356
Let's go!

29:13.729 --> 29:15.963
Take him out of here.

29:21.303 --> 29:22.569
Ah!

29:28.010 --> 29:29.943
Grenade!

29:29.945 --> 29:31.745
Ryan!

29:56.839 --> 29:58.472
Hi.

29:58.474 --> 30:01.541
You don't take no
for an answer.

30:01.543 --> 30:05.312
I know your hesitation,
and I want to talk about that.

30:05.314 --> 30:07.447
The intelligence committee file
on you

30:07.449 --> 30:11.351
and your relationship
to your son, Teo Braga.

30:11.353 --> 30:15.289
It also reveals the real reason
you resigned from the CIA.

30:15.291 --> 30:16.857
There was no affair.

30:16.859 --> 30:19.526
You did what was best
for the agency.

30:19.528 --> 30:21.495
So you know the truth.

30:21.497 --> 30:24.665
I got the committee to agree
to declassify it to the press.

30:26.835 --> 30:27.801
How?

30:27.803 --> 30:30.804
I'm good, Arthur.

30:30.806 --> 30:33.707
All of this is a story
that your voters need to hear.

30:33.709 --> 30:37.444
Now is the time to tell
that story on your terms.

30:40.916 --> 30:42.549
And you'll win.

30:42.551 --> 30:44.584
I'm listening.

30:46.455 --> 30:47.954
Cell service
has been restored,

30:47.956 --> 30:50.390
and I just need to speak
to Auggie.

30:50.392 --> 30:52.326
He went to debrief
to deal with Deckard.

30:52.328 --> 30:53.560
I can get him.

30:58.033 --> 31:00.634
Wait, alert Calder
and the SPOs.

31:00.636 --> 31:02.736
Langer's in the building.

31:18.954 --> 31:20.487
- In here, Mr. Anderson.
- Deckard.

31:20.489 --> 31:23.056
Auggie, I figured you were
still working on the ex-fil.

31:23.058 --> 31:24.391
Yeah, I am.

31:24.393 --> 31:25.426
They said you were down here
for a debrief.

31:25.427 --> 31:26.460
They came and got me.

31:26.462 --> 31:27.461
Didn't give me
a reason why.

31:27.463 --> 31:28.862
They never do, I guess.

31:28.864 --> 31:29.996
Hey, man,
you got to tell your boss

31:29.998 --> 31:30.997
there's been some kind of snafu.

31:30.999 --> 31:34.634
We can do this later.

31:34.636 --> 31:38.438
I've been told to do this now.

31:38.440 --> 31:39.773
What was that?

31:39.775 --> 31:41.375
Hey.

31:49.985 --> 31:52.986
Hey, you--

31:52.988 --> 31:54.855
Get the door.

31:54.857 --> 31:56.556
Get the door.

31:56.558 --> 31:58.592
Get the door.

31:58.594 --> 32:01.128
Hey!

32:01.130 --> 32:03.130
Hey!

32:24.420 --> 32:26.420
Get this door open!

32:26.422 --> 32:28.522
Hey!

32:53.049 --> 32:54.615
Deckard, you okay?

33:16.605 --> 33:18.572
<i>Momento.</i>

33:20.042 --> 33:23.110
I just off the phone
with Langley.

33:23.112 --> 33:26.046
The hit you put out on Auggie
and Deckard was unsuccessful.

33:29.218 --> 33:31.318
They're fine.

33:31.320 --> 33:33.587
Langer's dead.

33:36.225 --> 33:39.026
You sound satisfied.

33:39.028 --> 33:40.728
It's not about satisfaction.

33:40.730 --> 33:42.763
Then what is it about?

33:42.765 --> 33:44.765
Revenge.

33:46.335 --> 33:48.702
The Russians gave you up.

33:48.704 --> 33:50.504
Now you can make them hurt.

33:52.541 --> 33:55.376
The enemy of my enemy
is my friend.

34:00.016 --> 34:01.382
Thank you, friend.

34:25.041 --> 34:29.309
Joe, just the man
I was coming to see.

34:29.311 --> 34:31.245
I need a face-to-face
with your boss.

34:31.246 --> 34:32.379
It's funny
you should say that.

34:32.380 --> 34:34.514
He and I were talking
about you earlier.

34:34.516 --> 34:35.783
- Talking about me?
- Yeah.

34:35.784 --> 34:38.152
He wants to see you too.

34:45.226 --> 34:47.360
I took care of it, baby.

34:56.072 --> 34:58.238
They told me when I joined
that I'd have to be willing

34:58.240 --> 35:00.340
to give my life
for my country,

35:00.342 --> 35:04.278
and I was because I thought
I understood what that meant.

35:06.515 --> 35:10.117
I loved working for the CIA,

35:10.119 --> 35:15.289
but it took a tremendous toll
on my personal relationships.

35:15.291 --> 35:19.460
And after a while,
the job's all I had left.

35:19.462 --> 35:22.596
I knew as long
as I was an operative,

35:22.598 --> 35:26.400
that's all I would ever have,
and I want more than that.

35:26.402 --> 35:28.502
Other than that...

35:28.504 --> 35:31.405
Okay, I don't want
to die with regrets.

35:44.887 --> 35:46.420
Thank you.

35:51.627 --> 35:52.659
Auggie.

35:52.661 --> 35:54.294
Tash.

35:54.296 --> 35:55.429
You made it.

35:55.431 --> 35:56.697
Hey.

35:56.699 --> 35:58.599
Wouldn't miss it.

36:06.275 --> 36:08.175
It all happened so fast.

36:08.177 --> 36:11.145
I went to the DCI
to talk about Annie,

36:11.147 --> 36:13.780
and he offered me this post.

36:13.782 --> 36:14.848
And it sounded--

36:14.850 --> 36:16.250
Amazing, and it is.

36:16.252 --> 36:18.886
I mean, it's once in a lifetime.

36:18.888 --> 36:21.722
But what about you?
Senate run?

36:23.526 --> 36:25.325
There would be
public scrutiny,

36:25.327 --> 36:28.428
enormous pressure on us,
questions at every turn.

36:31.800 --> 36:33.600
Is it worth it?

36:36.205 --> 36:38.438
I don't know.

37:09.371 --> 37:12.573
What makes us so great
is what makes this so difficult.

37:17.546 --> 37:20.881
Our jobs are risky,

37:20.883 --> 37:24.685
and people I've loved have died
doing this kind of work.

37:30.492 --> 37:35.829
You can do this job and die
and not do this job and die.

37:44.640 --> 37:47.541
I don't want to lose you.

37:50.946 --> 37:53.914
Then don't.

38:13.869 --> 38:15.302
Thank you for coming in.

38:15.304 --> 38:16.536
I know
you don't work here anymore,

38:16.538 --> 38:19.973
so you're not obligated.

38:19.975 --> 38:22.042
I'm going to head up
a major task force.

38:22.044 --> 38:24.845
I'd like you to join me.

38:24.847 --> 38:26.546
Me?

38:26.548 --> 38:32.319
You, Annie Walker, because you
are dyed-in-the-wool CIA.

38:32.321 --> 38:34.054
What about my heart?

38:34.056 --> 38:35.689
I spoke with the DCI.

38:35.691 --> 38:37.891
I told him that if the rules
didn't allow for you

38:37.893 --> 38:41.762
to continue on, then the rules
needed to be rewritten.

38:41.764 --> 38:43.330
A few months ago,
I would have done anything

38:43.332 --> 38:45.999
to have this conversation.

38:46.001 --> 38:49.403
I risked my health
and my life to keep this job.

38:50.839 --> 38:53.674
I know.

38:53.676 --> 38:56.710
I get it.

38:56.712 --> 38:59.046
Sometimes it's easier
to want something

38:59.048 --> 39:00.714
than to have something.

39:14.797 --> 39:15.762
Auggie?

39:15.764 --> 39:17.064
Hey.

39:17.066 --> 39:18.066
What are you up to?

39:18.067 --> 39:21.001
- Nothing. Come on in.
- Thanks.

39:21.003 --> 39:22.469
What's going on?

39:22.471 --> 39:23.970
Well, I have news.

39:26.542 --> 39:28.075
You want some tea?

39:28.077 --> 39:30.844
I'm leaving the Agency.

39:30.846 --> 39:33.580
I wanted to tell you
in person.

39:37.119 --> 39:38.819
What?

39:38.821 --> 39:42.356
I turned in my paperwork
to support yesterday.

39:42.358 --> 39:43.824
I, um...

39:43.826 --> 39:45.892
I realized this life
gives me a lot,

39:45.894 --> 39:49.096
but there's a price.

39:49.098 --> 39:51.465
And I don't really know
anything else,

39:51.467 --> 39:55.936
but I'm ready
to try something new.

39:55.938 --> 39:58.805
Like what?

39:58.807 --> 40:03.577
Natasha and I are gonna travel
the world together.

40:03.579 --> 40:05.445
Be together.

40:08.784 --> 40:11.451
I'm happy for you.

40:11.453 --> 40:12.819
I'm stunned,

40:12.821 --> 40:13.854
but I'm happy for you.

40:13.856 --> 40:15.655
Thanks.

40:15.657 --> 40:17.591
- Thanks.
- That's a bold choice.

40:17.593 --> 40:18.725
Yeah.

40:23.866 --> 40:27.000
I'm gonna miss you, Walker.

40:31.774 --> 40:34.775
I'm gonna miss you too.

40:38.447 --> 40:39.846
Something else going on?

40:42.985 --> 40:45.419
I'm fine.

40:45.421 --> 40:47.888
You sure?

40:47.890 --> 40:51.458
I just have a lot
of big decisions to make.

40:52.761 --> 40:57.130
And since when do you
have trouble making decisions?

41:00.002 --> 41:01.902
I know, I'm the first one
out of the plane.

41:01.904 --> 41:04.738
Yeah.

41:04.740 --> 41:06.473
Mission decisions,
life and death--

41:06.475 --> 41:09.476
I can do it in a split second,
but these are...

41:11.580 --> 41:13.580
More difficult.

41:21.089 --> 41:22.122
Close your eyes.

41:22.124 --> 41:25.125
- Close my eyes?
- Wisdom of the blind.

41:30.132 --> 41:31.765
Closed.

41:31.767 --> 41:35.669
I want you
to look inside yourself.

41:35.671 --> 41:38.138
I want you to try and feel

41:38.140 --> 41:40.507
your instincts talking to you.

41:42.478 --> 41:44.478
Your intuition has never
let you down before.

41:44.480 --> 41:45.612
It won't now.

41:45.614 --> 41:47.647
So trust it.

41:49.485 --> 41:51.485
Trust your heart.
