18:45.229 --> 18:46.797
We did. Last year.

18:46.830 --> 18:49.434
But the academic
and athletic programs
have been recalibrated

18:49.467 --> 18:54.336
by The American Dream for
optimal participation by
the students and the faculty.

18:54.336 --> 18:55.773
I have no idea
what any of that means.

18:55.773 --> 18:58.442
There are plenty of other
after-school activities.

18:58.474 --> 19:01.644
How about cheerleading?
That's basically gymnastics.

19:01.644 --> 19:04.247
Plus, boys love cheerleaders.

19:04.281 --> 19:07.719
[camera shutter clicks]

19:07.751 --> 19:12.701
[rock music playing
on car radio]

19:19.663 --> 19:23.712
Okay. I can work with this.

19:36.613 --> 19:39.483
-[Crusher] Hey.
-Hi.

19:39.516 --> 19:41.719
You got your work cut out
for you here, huh?

19:41.751 --> 19:44.188
Uh, yeah, I got some cleaning
up to do for sure.

19:44.220 --> 19:45.422
[chuckles] I'll say.

19:45.455 --> 19:47.625
New in town, right?

19:47.657 --> 19:49.925
-I am. Yeah.
-Larry Crock.

19:49.960 --> 19:51.327
Pat Dugan.

19:51.362 --> 19:52.497
Friends call me "Crusher."

19:52.528 --> 19:55.532
-[knuckles crushing]
-Okay. [grunts]

19:55.567 --> 20:00.304
Gym down the street's mine.
Ripped City. Named it myself.

20:00.336 --> 20:02.272
-I like that.
-We got boot camp classes

20:02.272 --> 20:03.574
if you're looking
to get in shape.

20:03.574 --> 20:05.409
Yeah, I'm kind of focused
on getting this place--

20:05.442 --> 20:07.746
-Shred you right up, Pat.
-Yeah.

20:07.778 --> 20:10.848
I, uh... Pretty busy
with the garage and everything.

20:10.881 --> 20:13.585
I have a special for Blue
Valley newbies. Half off.

20:13.617 --> 20:15.685
Okay. "Don't be a wimp.
Get ripped."

20:15.686 --> 20:17.189
Well, thank you.
I'll keep it in mind.

20:17.189 --> 20:19.757
Well, I gotta get back.
Weights don't lift themselves.

20:19.790 --> 20:21.391
-Right.
-Don't be a stranger,
all right?

20:21.425 --> 20:23.326
Okay, nice to meet you, Larry.

20:23.359 --> 20:24.729
Call me "Crusher."

20:24.761 --> 20:27.397
-Crusher.
-I'm serious
about those classes.

20:27.431 --> 20:29.099
Let's get some muscle
on them bones!

20:29.099 --> 20:30.867
[chuckles]

20:30.900 --> 20:32.250
Nice car.

20:36.339 --> 20:37.839
Ah...

20:41.345 --> 20:45.345
[girl] I'm coming! Wait up!

20:56.493 --> 20:59.064
[Charlotte] The American Dream
bought and reopened
the Blue Valley tire factory,

20:59.096 --> 21:02.132
-but that's only the start.
-Wow, this is so exciting.

21:02.165 --> 21:03.467
We think so too.

21:03.500 --> 21:04.934
Investing back into
Blue Valley

21:04.970 --> 21:07.269
is more than a job
for everyone here
at The American Dream.

21:07.305 --> 21:09.006
[chuckles]
It's a way of life.

21:09.038 --> 21:10.840
Ah.

21:10.875 --> 21:12.809
Oh, that's Councilman
William Zarick,

21:12.844 --> 21:17.413
and that's our CFO,
Mr. Sharpe.

21:17.448 --> 21:21.484
-Your office
is right this way.
-"Office"?

21:21.519 --> 21:24.367
[school bell rings]

21:31.862 --> 21:33.663
Hey, new girl.

21:33.663 --> 21:34.665
Hi.

21:34.665 --> 21:36.599
-I'm Cindy. This is--
-Jenny.

21:36.634 --> 21:38.501
-Courtney.
-We know.

21:38.536 --> 21:41.305
-So you're from California?
-Yeah.

21:41.337 --> 21:42.840
We should all hang out.

21:42.873 --> 21:46.609
-Uh, yeah, sure.
-Cool. I'll text you.

21:46.644 --> 21:48.912
-Uh, my number is--
-Oh, I have it.

21:48.946 --> 21:51.413
-[chuckles] How do you have
my number--
-Don't worry about it.

21:51.448 --> 21:53.684
Hey, you should try out
for cheerleading.

21:53.717 --> 21:56.051
I am team captain,
and I'm looking for
a new second.

21:56.086 --> 21:58.255
I thought I was your second?

21:58.288 --> 22:00.290
I need someone
who can do the splits.

22:00.323 --> 22:01.724
I'm practicing.

22:01.759 --> 22:03.827
My family suffers
from short tendons.

22:03.862 --> 22:06.964
Thanks, but cheerleading's
not really my thing.

22:06.997 --> 22:08.765
Wait. So you don't want
to hang out?

22:08.799 --> 22:12.001
What? No. That's not
what I meant.

22:12.036 --> 22:13.203
-I'm sorry.
-Okay.

22:13.238 --> 22:18.009
-I wasn't--
-Great. Then I'll text you,
or not. Bye.

22:18.041 --> 22:19.777
[Jenny] I'm still
your second, right?

22:19.809 --> 22:23.013
-[school bell ringing]
-Cindy?

22:23.047 --> 22:26.015
Hey, who want to go right now?
I got you. I got you.
I got all of y'all.

22:26.049 --> 22:28.551
[all chattering]

22:28.586 --> 22:31.453
[all chanting]
Go! Go! Go! Go!

22:31.488 --> 22:32.989
[boy] Get him, yeah!

22:33.022 --> 22:34.957
Sorry. Sorry.

22:34.991 --> 22:36.192
Can I help you?

22:36.226 --> 22:38.028
Uh, I'm looking for a seat.

22:38.063 --> 22:43.063
[chuckles] There's one right
over there, sweetie.

22:43.465 --> 22:47.666
Oh! [smirks]
You're so cute.

22:55.310 --> 22:57.080
Hi, I'm Courtney.

22:57.113 --> 22:58.462
I'm Beth.

23:03.755 --> 23:07.653
Okay.
[chuckles nervously]

23:11.060 --> 23:16.060
So, uh, what do you guys do
for fun around here?

23:19.568 --> 23:23.340
Oh. Oh, we're not friends.

23:23.373 --> 23:25.442
This is the table
for the singles.

23:25.474 --> 23:27.577
"The singles"?

23:27.612 --> 23:30.145
[whispering] The losers.

23:30.180 --> 23:33.029
Speak for yourself.

23:37.321 --> 23:41.491
[Travis] Do you guys
smell that?
Do you smell something?

23:41.525 --> 23:43.594
Smells like slut.

23:43.626 --> 23:45.328
[snickers]

23:45.328 --> 23:47.230
Take any new pictures
you'd like to share with us?

23:47.230 --> 23:51.134
-[boy] Yeah, don't be shy.
-Leave her alone.

23:51.166 --> 23:52.836
Oh, hey, new girl.

23:52.871 --> 23:55.104
-What you got on your phone?
-Hey.

23:55.138 --> 23:56.506
-Give that back.
-[grunts]

23:56.540 --> 23:59.842
[students exclaiming]

23:59.876 --> 24:03.247
Nice.

24:03.278 --> 24:05.229
Come with me.

24:08.987 --> 24:11.188
-That's my boyfriend, bitch.
-Yeah.

24:11.221 --> 24:12.522
Cindy, language.

24:12.556 --> 24:16.006
Sorry, Principal Bowin.

24:18.961 --> 24:22.265
[Courtney sighs]

24:22.298 --> 24:23.798

24:32.242 --> 24:35.377

[school bell rings]

24:44.287 --> 24:45.988
[sighs]

24:46.022 --> 24:47.073
Really?

24:58.536 --> 24:59.568
[both] Hello.

24:59.604 --> 25:00.604
Hi.

25:22.358 --> 25:24.493
[dog barking]

25:24.528 --> 25:26.763
It was the best day
of school ever!

25:26.797 --> 25:29.134
I met these really cool kids
at computer design class.

25:29.166 --> 25:32.103
It's where you team up
and make your own video games.

25:32.135 --> 25:35.172
That's great, Mike.
Way to dive in. You know,
I'm proud of you.

25:35.205 --> 25:38.976
Yeah, and we started designing
this shooter. It's called
Blood Pizza Party.

25:39.009 --> 25:41.645
-It's called
Blood Pizza Party?
-Yeah.

25:41.680 --> 25:45.181
So that name's been okayed
with your teachers
and everything?

25:45.214 --> 25:46.282
Well, yeah. Pretty much.

25:46.317 --> 25:48.019
-Okay.
-But this place is awesome,
Dad, really.

25:48.050 --> 25:49.420
-Good.
-There's, like,
nothing to do here,

25:49.452 --> 25:51.589
so kids play way
more video games.

25:51.622 --> 25:55.092
[Barbara] How was your day,
Court? Did you join
the gymnastics team?

25:55.125 --> 25:58.894
-[cell phone chimes]
-Oh, wait, Dad, can I go over
to Johnny's house?

25:58.930 --> 26:01.932
We're gonna play Fortnite
for research. It's learning.

26:01.965 --> 26:03.800
Sure. Just be back by 9:00.

26:03.835 --> 26:06.336
Wait, wait, 9:00?
It's Friday.

26:06.368 --> 26:08.571
Oh, yeah. Okay, 9:01.

26:08.605 --> 26:09.773
[Pat chuckles]

26:09.806 --> 26:11.741
Why are dad jokes always
the opposite of funny?

26:11.775 --> 26:13.778
-Hey, finish your dinner.
-I'm getting dessert.

26:13.809 --> 26:18.309
Do you have any plans
tonight?

26:19.082 --> 26:20.784
Hey, we could hit
the old drive-in.

26:20.817 --> 26:23.519
Stop pretending
you're my dad, okay?

26:23.554 --> 26:25.788
-Oh, boy.
-[Barbara] Courtney!

26:25.823 --> 26:27.291
[Pat] No, it's okay.

26:27.324 --> 26:30.425
I think that, you know,
sometimes, I try too hard.

26:30.461 --> 26:32.461
-It just doesn't--
-No.

26:32.496 --> 26:36.095
You're trying just fine.

26:39.269 --> 26:40.805
What are you doing?

26:40.836 --> 26:44.641
Microwaving some marshmallows.

26:44.643 --> 26:45.643
Want some?

[sighs]

27:26.048 --> 27:27.248
So lame.

27:42.500 --> 27:44.599
What the heck?

28:24.741 --> 28:28.109
"Stripesy."

28:28.144 --> 28:29.144
Pat?

28:52.336 --> 28:57.336
"Dear Stripesy,
my friend and partner.
Starman."

Nothing.
I didn't do anything.

Oh, but you, you don't get
to ask the questions, Pat,

35:47.483 --> 35:49.353
if that's
even your real name.

35:49.385 --> 35:52.255
-It's Patrick.
-You mean, Stripesy.

35:52.289 --> 35:54.023
All right, give me that.

35:54.056 --> 35:55.992
That's incredibly dangerous.

35:56.025 --> 35:58.193
I know. It blew up a car.

35:58.228 --> 36:00.831
-You blew up a car?
-I didn't. It did.

36:00.862 --> 36:02.500
[staff warbling]

36:02.532 --> 36:05.769
[scoffs] I was only going
to let the air out
of their tires.

36:05.804 --> 36:10.407
[Pat] Okay.
Look, are you okay?
And was anyone hurt?

36:10.440 --> 36:12.675
Everyone's fine.

36:12.710 --> 36:15.679
The car lost a little
resale value, though.

36:15.711 --> 36:18.614
[scoffs] That's good.
That's funny.

36:18.648 --> 36:20.585
What is this thing, anyway?

36:20.617 --> 36:23.621
-It's called the Cosmic Staff.
-Okay.

36:23.653 --> 36:28.653
-It's extremely temperamental.
-[staff warbling]

36:37.068 --> 36:40.536
And it should be back
in its crate where it belongs,

36:40.572 --> 36:45.510
not vandalizing automobiles
and endangering people's lives.

36:45.541 --> 36:49.746
The staff's not supposed
to work for anyone
except Starman.

36:49.778 --> 36:50.880
Starman?

36:50.916 --> 36:54.251
The Justice Society of America
was before your time.

36:54.284 --> 36:55.885
I know who they are,

36:55.885 --> 36:59.188
a bunch of superheroes
from the old days. They quit
when I was a kid.

36:59.222 --> 37:00.858
Well, they
didn't exactly quit.

37:00.891 --> 37:04.594
Starman and the JSA died
saving the world

37:04.628 --> 37:09.628
ten years ago.
It was Christmas Eve.

37:10.233 --> 37:12.735
Ten years ago
on Christmas Eve?

37:12.769 --> 37:16.608
[sighs] What?

37:16.639 --> 37:19.643
Does my mom
know any of this?

37:19.675 --> 37:22.380
Uh, no, I didn't tell her.

37:22.411 --> 37:24.248
And it isn't right
not to be honest,

37:24.282 --> 37:28.452
but people have died because
they got too close to the JSA.

37:28.485 --> 37:31.255
You know the truth,
and you're at risk even now!

37:31.288 --> 37:35.925
Right.

37:35.960 --> 37:37.728
[Pat sighs] Look,

37:37.760 --> 37:42.032
I don't mean to get upset.
It's just the staff
was missing,

37:42.065 --> 37:45.335
and I was concerned.

37:45.367 --> 37:47.938
Are you all right?

37:47.971 --> 37:49.206
Court?

37:49.239 --> 37:54.239
Why would the staff work
for me if it only worked
for Starman?

37:55.980 --> 38:00.980
-I don't know.
-There must be a reason.

38:01.485 --> 38:03.987
What if Starman
was my father?

38:04.019 --> 38:06.523
If... If what?

38:06.556 --> 38:09.726
Starman died the exact night
my father vanished.

38:09.760 --> 38:12.663
Okay, that would be
the coincidence
to end all coincidences,

38:12.697 --> 38:14.197
-if Starman was your father.
-Okay.

38:14.231 --> 38:16.567
-What about fate, Pat?
-It's beyond the realm
of possibilities.

38:16.599 --> 38:20.737
Destiny? I mean,
maybe the stars aligned.

38:20.769 --> 38:23.239
Stars...

38:23.273 --> 38:24.608
Starman.

38:24.641 --> 38:28.746
[stutters] It would make
so much sense.

38:28.778 --> 38:33.778
My father never showed up
that night...

38:34.452 --> 38:39.402
because he died
saving the world.

38:39.489 --> 38:43.389
Sit down. Okay, come here.

38:46.795 --> 38:48.331
Hey.

38:48.364 --> 38:50.134
What was your father's name?

38:50.166 --> 38:53.469
Sam Kurtis. That's him.

38:53.503 --> 38:57.239
Well, Starman's name
was Sylvester Pemberton.

38:57.273 --> 38:58.608
[sighs] Okay.

38:58.643 --> 39:01.112
-Yeah.
-Well, maybe Sam Kurtis
was an alias.

39:01.144 --> 39:04.347
I mean,
I've looked for him online
and never found anything.

39:04.380 --> 39:06.083
Not a single picture.

39:06.117 --> 39:08.853
-Starman
is not your dad, okay?
-[chuckles]

39:08.885 --> 39:13.289
The staff works for you
for some reason.
I don't know why.

39:13.322 --> 39:14.425
But that's not it.

39:14.456 --> 39:16.960
-I've gotta ask Mom.
-So the sooner you--

39:16.992 --> 39:18.327
Oh, boy.

39:18.362 --> 39:21.197
[footsteps receding]

39:21.231 --> 39:22.599
Mom!

39:22.632 --> 39:25.001
You owe Pat an apology,
young lady.

39:25.036 --> 39:28.538
No, I don't, because maybe
Pat's not who you think he is.

39:28.572 --> 39:31.007
Courtney, enough.

39:31.041 --> 39:32.443
Was my dad a superhero?

39:32.474 --> 39:34.043
I'm not joking around here.

39:34.077 --> 39:36.780
I'm not joking either.

39:36.813 --> 39:40.317
You want to know the truth
about your father?

39:40.349 --> 39:42.920
Your Dad, the superhero,

39:42.952 --> 39:45.255
he only came to see you
once a year,

39:45.288 --> 39:47.891
until you were five
and then he...

39:47.925 --> 39:52.362
He just abandoned us,
Courtney.

39:52.394 --> 39:53.730
-Mom.
-There's...

39:53.764 --> 39:58.300
There's only been one man
who's ever been there for us.

39:58.335 --> 40:02.806
And that's Pat.

40:02.840 --> 40:05.474
You know, if your dad was
as great as you think he is,

40:05.510 --> 40:09.579
he would be here right now
instead of Pat.

40:09.612 --> 40:14.416
But he's not.

40:14.452 --> 40:17.521
Anyway.

40:17.554 --> 40:22.090
Now what?
You were saying something.

40:22.126 --> 40:26.429
I...

40:26.463 --> 40:29.800
Nothing.

40:29.833 --> 40:33.884
Okay. Good night, Courtney.

40:41.510 --> 40:45.215
Tell me again, son,
what happened?

40:45.250 --> 40:47.117
Travis and Brian and I were
at the drive-in.

40:47.152 --> 40:48.987
And we were minding
our own business, Dad.

40:49.019 --> 40:53.188
The part about
the staff, Junior.

40:53.224 --> 40:55.525
Someone...

40:55.559 --> 40:57.327
They had this glowing thing.

40:57.362 --> 41:02.362
It shot... I don't know.
Fire or lasers or something.

41:03.201 --> 41:05.335
I know I should have asked
to take the car, Dad--

41:05.367 --> 41:07.036
What did they look like?

41:07.070 --> 41:10.407
Who were they?

41:10.440 --> 41:13.889
It was too hard to see.

41:18.282 --> 41:21.251
Go to your room.

41:21.286 --> 41:26.286
We'll talk more about this
in the morning.

41:27.090 --> 41:28.440
Yes, sir.

41:44.574 --> 41:46.675
[lock turning]

42:08.697 --> 42:11.099
[metal creaking]

42:36.594 --> 42:40.130
[crickets chirping]

42:40.163 --> 42:41.963
[door opens]

42:51.340 --> 42:53.610
[Courtney] So...

42:53.643 --> 42:58.581
Your name was Stripesy?

42:58.614 --> 43:00.451
'Cause of all the stripes.

43:00.483 --> 43:03.586
Yeah. I...
I got that. [chuckles]

43:03.621 --> 43:06.523
Someone really should have
helped you brainstorm
a better code name.

43:06.556 --> 43:08.492
-What's wrong with it?
-Um...

43:08.527 --> 43:13.163
Well, for starters, I highly
doubt it intimidated
the bad guys. I mean,

43:13.197 --> 43:17.501
"Look out!
Here comes Stripesy."
[chuckles]

43:17.536 --> 43:23.239
Well, see, Stripesy made more
sense when Sylvester went
by the Star-Spangled Kid.

43:23.239 --> 43:25.476
"The Star-Spangled Kid"?

43:25.510 --> 43:29.380
Yeah, you see, Sylvester was
15 when we met. I was 20.

43:29.413 --> 43:33.217
I was his family's driver
and their mechanic.

43:33.251 --> 43:37.653
He put on a mask to stop
some criminals that were
threatening his parents.

43:37.688 --> 43:40.724
And I helped him.

43:40.759 --> 43:45.262
Anyways, later he...
He got the staff,
and he became Starman.

43:45.295 --> 43:48.998
And he joined the JSA,
and he brought me along.

43:49.032 --> 43:51.101
Okay.

43:51.135 --> 43:55.005
What were you?
Like, the Star-Spangled Kid's
assistant?

43:55.038 --> 43:57.840
I was Starman's sidekick.

43:57.875 --> 44:00.443
I looked after his car.
I kept his suit clean.

44:00.478 --> 44:04.081
Sounds like an assistant
to me.

44:04.114 --> 44:06.818
Being a sidekick was an honor.

44:06.849 --> 44:10.019
They made me a really
important part of the JSA.

44:10.054 --> 44:13.690
Well, why aren't you
in the picture then?

44:13.724 --> 44:15.525
Because I took it.

44:15.559 --> 44:19.429
[sighs] Look.

44:19.463 --> 44:21.666
I don't like that you've
kept this from my mom.

44:21.697 --> 44:22.898
Ah...

44:22.934 --> 44:27.005
But you make her happy.

44:27.036 --> 44:29.639
Happier than I've ever
seen her and...

44:29.672 --> 44:31.442
I don't want
to take that away.

44:31.474 --> 44:34.510
I can't.

44:34.545 --> 44:36.579
So I'll keep your secret...

44:36.612 --> 44:38.815
as long as you stay out
of my way.

44:38.849 --> 44:43.586
Stay... Stay out of your way?
I mean, hey...

44:43.621 --> 44:46.989
You don't even have
a driver's license yet,
all right?

44:47.023 --> 44:49.193
This isn't just about
keeping my secret.

44:49.226 --> 44:54.226
This is about keeping
your mother and you safe.
Mike, too.

44:54.364 --> 44:57.733
You understand that?

44:57.768 --> 45:01.771
-Okay.
-Okay.

45:01.804 --> 45:05.309
So do we have
a deal, Stripesy?

45:05.340 --> 45:06.610
[chuckles]

45:06.644 --> 45:11.581
I guess when
you call me Stripesy,
I see your point.

45:11.614 --> 45:15.385
Yeah, it's bad.

45:15.418 --> 45:19.322
[Pat sighs]

45:19.355 --> 45:21.523
Good talk.

45:21.559 --> 45:23.809
[siren wailing]

45:27.599 --> 45:29.400
-[Jordan]
You're certain, Henry?
-[Brainwave on phone] Yes.

45:29.434 --> 45:32.402
Someone attacked
my son tonight...

45:32.434 --> 45:33.804
with a glowing staff.

45:33.836 --> 45:35.938
[Jordan] I killed Starman.

45:35.972 --> 45:37.074
Starman's dead.

45:37.108 --> 45:38.842
[Brainwave]
I know he's dead.

45:38.876 --> 45:42.079
Meaning, there's a new
Starman out there.

45:42.112 --> 45:45.614
He's found us.
And he came after my son.

45:45.648 --> 45:47.784
[Jordan] I doubt
that very much.

45:47.818 --> 45:49.818
We'll sort this out, Henry.

45:49.853 --> 45:52.590
Do nothing until I return.
Understood?

45:52.621 --> 45:55.626
I understand, Jordan.

45:55.657 --> 45:56.708
[sighs]

46:27.708 --> 46:28.692
[staff warbling]

46:28.692 --> 46:30.041
[screams]

46:34.389 --> 46:36.300
What are you doing?

46:36.300 --> 46:38.168
[staff warbling]

46:38.202 --> 46:41.871
[Barbara] Courtney,
are you okay?

46:41.905 --> 46:43.105
[grunts]

46:47.277 --> 46:49.512
Stay.

46:49.545 --> 46:52.282
-What's going on?
-Uh...

46:52.317 --> 46:56.653
I couldn't sleep.
Sorry, I didn't mean
to wake you.

46:56.686 --> 46:59.056
Oh, honey.

46:59.090 --> 47:01.059
I'm sorry about what I said.

47:01.090 --> 47:02.960
I know it's been really hard
on you.

47:02.992 --> 47:05.429
No, Mom, I'm sorry.

47:05.461 --> 47:08.931
I haven't given Pat
a real chance.
But, I'm gonna try.

47:08.965 --> 47:11.300
Really, really try.
New start.

47:11.335 --> 47:13.536
You have no idea how much
that means to me.

47:13.570 --> 47:15.672
For sure. Good night!

47:15.706 --> 47:18.706
[scoffs] Good night.

47:33.889 --> 47:36.425
[staff warbling]

47:36.460 --> 47:37.994
What? What is it?

47:38.028 --> 47:39.028
[staff warbling]

47:39.028 --> 47:40.730
Hey, it's cold out.

47:40.764 --> 47:42.114
[screams]

48:00.952 --> 48:03.887
[Courtney yelling]

48:03.920 --> 48:06.056
Ow!

48:06.090 --> 48:08.192
This is getting a bit old.

48:08.224 --> 48:10.925
[breathes heavily]

48:16.032 --> 48:20.382
Why did you bring me
up here?

48:29.045 --> 48:33.695
Oh, okay, yeah.
Let's practice.

48:35.585 --> 48:36.786
[grunts]

48:41.759 --> 48:44.894
[staff warbling]

48:44.929 --> 48:45.978
[sighs]

49:01.077 --> 49:02.577
[laughing]

49:13.356 --> 49:14.556
Woo-hoo!

49:18.862 --> 49:21.262
Whoa! [laughing]

49:30.806 --> 49:33.010
[grunts]

49:33.043 --> 49:34.393
[screams]

49:39.614 --> 49:42.920

[grunting]

50:06.844 --> 50:08.492

50:21.556 --> 50:22.556
Help!

50:26.996 --> 50:31.001
[panting]

50:31.034 --> 50:32.034
Hello?

50:36.739 --> 50:38.574
[Brainwave] Who are you?

50:38.608 --> 50:42.077
[gasps]

50:42.112 --> 50:44.447
Where did you get
that staff?

50:44.481 --> 50:48.585
-[choking]
-Why did you go after my son?

50:48.617 --> 50:53.556
[screaming]

50:53.590 --> 50:55.989
[Courtney] Help!

51:00.563 --> 51:05.101
After I pry the answers
I want from your brain...

51:05.135 --> 51:06.871
[panting]

51:06.903 --> 51:09.606
I'll melt it.

51:09.639 --> 51:13.777
I can read thoughts
of loneliness.

51:13.809 --> 51:15.945
Isolation.

51:15.978 --> 51:18.782
You have no one.

51:18.815 --> 51:20.885
Do something.

51:20.916 --> 51:23.653
[Brainwave] No friends.

51:23.686 --> 51:26.621
You're all alone.

51:26.657 --> 51:30.460
Your father.

51:30.494 --> 51:32.862
Why are you thinking about
your father?

51:32.896 --> 51:35.065
[screaming] Come on!

51:35.099 --> 51:36.297
[grunts]

52:05.295 --> 52:06.644
[panting]

52:13.170 --> 52:15.871

[Courtney whimpering]

52:22.644 --> 52:24.815
[panting]

52:24.849 --> 52:29.849
