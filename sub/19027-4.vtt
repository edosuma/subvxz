WEBVTT

00:04.343 --> 00:05.736
I really missed living with Turk,

00:05.773 --> 00:07.595
but living with Elliot wasn't that bad.

00:07.773 --> 00:08.468
Hey, roomie!

00:08.741 --> 00:10.073
I'm having the girls from my yoga class

00:10.074 --> 00:13.532
over for drinks tonight.
And F.Y.I., Tina, the tiny brunette,
(<i>F.Y.I. = For Your Information</i>) 

00:13.648 --> 00:14.718
just got dumped

00:14.793 --> 00:16.662
and she's looking for rebound sex!

00:17.065 --> 00:17.817
Honestly,

00:17.910 --> 00:19.535
how could I be a better roommate?

00:19.615 --> 00:22.543
She could be half Turk and half Elliot.

00:23.970 --> 00:25.355
Hey, dawg, if you die before me,

00:25.355 --> 00:26.659
you can play with my boobies while I finish.

00:28.578 --> 00:30.128
I died, Turkiot.

00:31.105 --> 00:32.253
Hellooooo!

00:34.226 --> 00:35.380
J.D., what are you doing?

00:36.066 --> 00:36.831
Nothing.

00:36.977 --> 00:38.592
Because it looked like you were thinking

00:38.625 --> 00:39.873
about fondling my breasts.

00:39.906 --> 00:41.571
And if that's the case, then stop thinking

00:41.595 --> 00:43.681
and start...fondling.

00:47.706 --> 00:48.950
Dude, what the hell are you doing!?

00:49.135 --> 00:50.711
I miss having you as my roommate! 

00:50.745 --> 00:51.620
I don't know....

00:52.556 --> 00:55.170
Check it out -- Keith's telling Mr. Morrison 
about his brain tumor.

00:55.595 --> 00:57.030
Seeing an intern tell someone they're gonna die 

00:57.045 --> 00:59.203
for the first time is strange.

00:59.427 --> 01:02.090
Because even though it's a horrible and sad experience, 

01:02.996 --> 01:05.740
if they get through it, there's a sense of

01:05.947 --> 01:07.110
...accomplishment.

01:07.328 --> 01:08.170
Nailed it! 

01:08.216 --> 01:09.050
Hell, yeah!

01:09.677 --> 01:11.043
Good job, man. What'd you say?

01:11.346 --> 01:12.483
 Well, I just told him 

01:12.495 --> 01:13.810
that there's nothing more we can do right now.

01:13.936 --> 01:15.182
Oooooh.

01:15.266 --> 01:15.881
What?

01:15.998 --> 01:17.412
"Nothing more we can do right now"

01:17.458 --> 01:19.460
implies there may be something we can do tomorrow.

01:19.748 --> 01:20.933
Well, I also said 

01:20.956 --> 01:22.363
we'd make him as comfortable as possible!

01:22.426 --> 01:24.830
Sounds like someone's getting new pillows and a comforter.

01:24.956 --> 01:26.642
That man knows he's doomed!

01:30.616 --> 01:31.621
Yeeeeaaaah, 

01:31.666 --> 01:32.943
I'm gonna need you to go back in there 

01:32.975 --> 01:34.772
and use some form of the word "die" 

01:34.797 --> 01:36.083
dead, dying, 

01:36.125 --> 01:38.360
deadsies, Deadwood

01:38.405 --> 01:39.513
your choice.

01:39.545 --> 01:40.761
What was the middle one?

01:40.835 --> 01:41.670
Deadwood?

01:43.125 --> 01:44.052
Deadwood ?

01:44.105 --> 01:45.793
Did you know cowboys used to curse?

01:45.848 --> 01:46.992
I didn't know that.

01:47.045 --> 01:48.202
Gather round, people! 

01:48.225 --> 01:50.613
Dr. Kelso has an announcement to make!

01:50.657 --> 01:51.952
That'll be all, Ted.

01:51.967 --> 01:53.633
You can go back to doing whatever you were doing.

01:53.686 --> 01:54.972
It was my day off.

01:57.407 --> 01:58.903
Due to lack of funds,

01:58.937 --> 02:01.071
I'm shutting down our babymobile,

02:01.115 --> 02:03.170
which means there will no longer be 

02:03.215 --> 02:05.482
free prenatal care for underprivileged women.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.702
Bottom line -- if you're thinking about knocking up 

02:08.728 --> 02:09.852
a homeless gal, I'd do it this weekend.

02:09.936 --> 02:10.913
Hahaha !

02:10.978 --> 02:12.321
Thank you, Colonel Doctor.

02:12.368 --> 02:13.202
Excuse me?

02:13.235 --> 02:14.713
I'm sorry, I don't know your name,

02:14.747 --> 02:16.710
and you look like that Kentucky Fried Chicken guy.

02:18.168 --> 02:19.320
Moving on.

02:19.537 --> 02:22.591
This Friday, I am receiving an award from the A.M.A.
[American Medical Association]

02:22.717 --> 02:24.430
Jerk-Off of the Year. 

02:24.446 --> 02:26.372
No, Bastard of the Year!

02:26.408 --> 02:27.643
Uh, don't you tell me!

02:27.686 --> 02:30.710
Guy I Despise So Much, I'd Pay Someone

...of the Year.

02:39.127 --> 02:40.743
Aaand we're back.

02:40.775 --> 02:41.763
Anyway, 

02:41.795 --> 02:45.161
I need one of you attendings to introduce me at the dinner, so figure it out.

02:45.748 --> 02:47.251
How do we handle this?

02:47.336 --> 02:49.060
Same way we have for years.

02:49.805 --> 02:52.433
First one who falls...introduces Kelso.

02:52.536 --> 02:55.152
Unfortunately for you guys, I have the balance of a--

02:55.326 --> 02:59.271
Careful! You're about to let Dr. Cox 
know you were a gymnast in high school!

02:59.825 --> 03:01.812
Fine, let's do this. 

03:01.868 --> 03:03.330
Wheels up. 

03:05.197 --> 03:08.151
'Kay, come on, Dorian. Find your center! 

03:08.257 --> 03:10.303
Round the rosie! 

03:11.925 --> 03:13.292
Hey! I got it! 

03:14.576 --> 03:16.380
WhoooaaaI don't got it!

03:20.207 --> 03:21.662
Reel it in! Take it clockwise!

03:21.697 --> 03:23.423
Fight your feeeeaaaar!

03:25.287 --> 03:26.700
Come on, come on. Be the chair!

03:26.736 --> 03:28.660
You gotta want it, Johnny D.!

03:28.688 --> 03:29.881
You gotta want it!

03:36.835 --> 03:38.362
Oh! Tough break, there, Newbie. 

03:38.755 --> 03:41.351
Group! Position right! Ho! 

03:41.708 --> 03:43.703
I don't know but I believe!

03:43.765 --> 03:45.783
I don't know but I believe!

03:45.905 --> 03:46.500
Newbie's loss...

03:47.057 --> 03:50.010
Scrubs épisode 5x03

03:55.996 --> 03:58.803
Pour Forom.com

04:00.697 --> 04:03.092
So I have to introduce Kelso. Big whoop.

04:03.178 --> 04:05.562
I don't think you understand the predicament that you're in here. 

04:05.626 --> 04:08.080
Kelso expects a long, glowing testimonial. 

04:08.117 --> 04:10.223
The kind that make men cheer 

04:10.247 --> 04:11.590
and women...

04:11.658 --> 04:13.130
what is it that women do, Newbie?

04:13.156 --> 04:14.143
How the hell would I know?

04:14.196 --> 04:15.282
They swoon!

04:15.318 --> 04:18.051
Look, if you get up there and start kissing Kelso's ass, 

04:18.077 --> 04:20.140
all your fellow attendings will forever think of you 

04:20.165 --> 04:21.831
as a brown-nosing toady. 

04:21.887 --> 04:24.330
On the other hand, if you don't pucker up, 

04:24.355 --> 04:26.331
Kelso will make your life a living hell. 

04:26.957 --> 04:28.841
You're officially trapped.

04:28.938 --> 04:31.300
 I'll just say something nice about him that's actually true.

04:31.397 --> 04:33.900
You go do that. And I'll go find God,

04:33.907 --> 04:35.980
quit drinking, 
get in touch with myself emotionally,

04:36.016 --> 04:38.391
and we'll meet right back here 
at half past impossible. 

04:38.547 --> 04:39.690
Mm'kay?

04:39.767 --> 04:41.681
Everyone has a human side, Coxy. 

04:41.745 --> 04:43.031
Even Kelso.

04:43.076 --> 04:44.631
The hell he does.

04:44.675 --> 04:46.451
 I remember a flu epidemic 

04:46.498 --> 04:48.661
we lost half a dozen children in one day. Hm.

04:50.196 --> 04:52.693
The second Kelso's foot hits the bottom of those stairs 

04:56.837 --> 04:58.511
he doesn't have a care in the world..

04:59.295 --> 05:00.810
You know, Laverne, I'm a doctor.

05:00.868 --> 05:03.981
So I'm not really gonna take my psychological evaluations 

05:04.035 --> 05:05.961
from someone who dispenses them 

05:05.966 --> 05:08.092
in between watching Maury and eating a corn muffin.

05:08.618 --> 05:10.893
Okay, that was too mean. Apologize.

05:11.105 --> 05:12.703
Laverne, I...

05:12.768 --> 05:14.661
Aw, the hell with it. 
She's not gonna forgive you 

05:14.718 --> 05:15.913
go for broke!

05:15.966 --> 05:17.981
I  was watching CNN earlier. 

05:18.025 --> 05:20.060
Apparently the terror alert in your armpits 

05:20.095 --> 05:21.761
has been elevated to orange. 

05:21.840 --> 05:23.185
Oh, no he didn't! 

05:23.215 --> 05:24.959
Yes, Laverne, he did.

05:28.488 --> 05:30.608
"Laverne...I'm a doctor..." 

05:31.185 --> 05:32.651
You're a bit of a know-it-all, aren't you.

05:32.698 --> 05:33.991
Well, I know a lot.

05:34.025 --> 05:35.372
Yeah? Who was Deep Throat?

05:35.838 --> 05:38.520
Mark Felt, the FBI guy. 
That's been all over the news for months.

05:39.385 --> 05:40.802
Oh, sorry, rich boy.

05:40.866 --> 05:42.443
 My TV doesn't get the news.

05:42.526 --> 05:45.570
Just the Bible channel 
and some kind of Chinese boxing. 

05:46.477 --> 05:48.340
I bet you don't know how to play Jiggly Ball!

05:48.448 --> 05:49.903
That's because there's no such thing.

05:50.495 --> 05:51.862
Ha-HA! I knew you didn't know.

05:55.438 --> 05:57.731
I know if I just follow Dr. Kelso around for a while, 

05:57.776 --> 05:59.721
he'll eventually do something decent. 

06:00.015 --> 06:01.640
I'm a master of stealth,

06:01.716 --> 06:03.693
 I can sneak up on anybody.

06:04.216 --> 06:05.880
Why are you following me?

06:06.357 --> 06:08.351
 Sir, aren't you being a little paranoid?

06:08.396 --> 06:09.800
I was in 'Nam, you know. 

06:09.855 --> 06:11.441
They pulled off my fingernails.

06:11.547 --> 06:13.362
When did you get an earring?

06:14.715 --> 06:17.252
 Enid, I'm not cheating on you!

06:17.297 --> 06:19.042
This earring is mine!

06:22.275 --> 06:23.822
See?

06:23.897 --> 06:25.312
It's a hip-hop world, son. 

06:25.336 --> 06:27.351
Keep up or get out of the way.

06:28.226 --> 06:29.830
I gotta get an earring!

06:31.605 --> 06:33.430
Turk, have you heard of Jiggly Ball?

06:33.467 --> 06:35.170
Yeah, it's a game the orderlies made up.

06:35.277 --> 06:36.862
I've heard of it, too. 

06:36.998 --> 06:38.771
It's so awesome that we've both heard of it.

06:38.828 --> 06:40.622
Yes. That--that's awesome.

06:40.956 --> 06:42.211
Mr. Keck!

06:42.255 --> 06:44.983
What do you say we get you into surgery and take care of that hernia!

06:45.936 --> 06:48.220
Ummm, I don't know if surgery is necessary. 

06:49.077 --> 06:52.050
Last night I was in pain, so I went to a free clinic. 

06:52.107 --> 06:55.100
The doctor there said surgery wasn't my only option.

06:55.208 --> 06:56.983
Well, you're just gonna have to get him on the phone

06:56.997 --> 06:58.840
and tell him that I won't be second-opinioned 

06:58.866 --> 07:01.082
by a clinic doctor who couldn't carry my jockstrap!

07:01.138 --> 07:02.640
- Gimme some!
- Here it is.

07:03.286 --> 07:04.581
Yeah, I think I know this guy.

07:04.616 --> 07:06.783
Is he a cocky black doctor with a white doctor 

07:06.815 --> 07:09.301
following him around and looking at him like he's in love?

07:09.848 --> 07:11.782
You would make a pretty girl.

07:12.638 --> 07:13.592
Yeah.

07:13.647 --> 07:15.382
All right, now repeat after me...

07:15.876 --> 07:17.720
"You can't decide for me, 

07:17.768 --> 07:19.050
that's not your duty."

07:19.107 --> 07:21.421
And are they both trying not to laugh at the word "duty"?

07:24.316 --> 07:25.280
Yeah. 

07:25.395 --> 07:27.750
Hey, Heckle and Jeckle, you know what?
No surgery.

07:28.506 --> 07:29.951
Who the hell is this?

07:30.346 --> 07:31.953
Where are my shoelaces?

07:33.065 --> 07:36.022
I said to tell him that he had a laxity in the peritoneal wall 

07:36.036 --> 07:37.222
and that surgery was unnecessarily invasive! 

07:37.236 --> 07:38.370
Was that so hard?

07:40.625 --> 07:42.753
Mr. Morrison, I understand

07:42.795 --> 07:44.920
that one of our interns spent an hour in here

07:44.926 --> 07:47.950
telling you over and over that you are going to die.

07:48.035 --> 07:51.070
I would make him apologize personally, 

07:51.127 --> 07:52.930
but I'm having him spend the rest of the day 

07:52.936 --> 07:54.750
checking that countertop's heartbeat.

07:56.497 --> 07:58.310
- Sorry, Mr. Morrison!
- KEITH!

07:58.387 --> 08:00.180
I think Mr. Countertop 

08:00.188 --> 08:02.911
would really appreciate your undivided attention. 

08:04.647 --> 08:05.441
Now,

08:05.447 --> 08:08.250
the  hospital is running an experimental drug trial on a medication 

08:08.255 --> 08:09.805
that they're hoping 

08:09.808 --> 08:11.581
will reduce the size of tumors. 

08:11.925 --> 08:15.281
And, well, I'm gonna try my hardest to get you in there.

08:15.607 --> 08:17.473
I really appreciate that, sir.

08:17.767 --> 08:19.160
Ahhh !

08:19.166 --> 08:22.081
Ahhh! Checking Mr. Countertop's heartrate!

08:22.086 --> 08:23.041
Memories. 

08:23.096 --> 08:24.790
Do you know that once, Dr. Cox 

08:24.807 --> 08:28.331
made me give every air conditioning unit in this hospital a pap-smear? 

08:29.008 --> 08:33.102
The wacky thing was room 403 did have some yeast issues.

08:33.846 --> 08:37.370
Dr. Cox, this intro is killing me. Have you seen Kelso?

08:37.378 --> 08:40.351
Nope! But, our new patient, Mr. Franks, in here 

08:40.355 --> 08:41.822
is crazy rich, so

08:41.828 --> 08:43.672
I'd imagine Big Bob will be here 

08:43.686 --> 08:45.513
momentarily to make love to his moneyclip.

08:46.957 --> 08:48.601
Hi! Bob Kelso.

08:50.225 --> 08:52.073
Listen up, bozos.

08:52.116 --> 08:55.742
That gentleman over there is basically a cash piñata 

08:55.746 --> 08:57.372
waiting to be whacked open. 

08:57.376 --> 08:59.181
So how about someone diagnoses him 

08:59.187 --> 09:00.592
so I can get my candy?

09:00.627 --> 09:02.182
I'll be glad to do it, Bob

09:02.368 --> 09:04.482
if you'll do me a favor and put my patient, 

09:04.485 --> 09:07.692
Mr. Morrison, in that experimental drug trial.

09:07.808 --> 09:09.371
Sure, what the hell.

09:09.375 --> 09:10.571
Deal.

09:11.306 --> 09:14.122
Finally I had something I could say in my speech...

09:15.707 --> 09:18.052
Dr. Kelso was an angel!

09:19.817 --> 09:21.181
Look, Lorraine,

09:21.187 --> 09:24.363
the sooner you let me have a look at that rash, 
the sooner we can get you back home.

09:25.206 --> 09:27.911
I mean, back on the street, which is your home. 

09:27.917 --> 09:30.213
Hey! Home Street Home, huh?

09:30.226 --> 09:31.280
I'm sorry, Lorraine, 

09:31.288 --> 09:32.840
that was incredibly insensitive.

09:37.267 --> 09:38.252
Frick!

09:42.618 --> 09:45.061
So this is where germs are born!

09:45.236 --> 09:47.213
I cannot believe that you told these guys!

09:47.216 --> 09:48.480
Elliot, she didn't.

09:48.485 --> 09:50.451
My patient told me that his clinic doctor 

09:50.456 --> 09:52.013
was this blonde-haired woman 

09:52.017 --> 09:53.482
who talked so fast 

09:53.487 --> 09:55.171
and in such a high-pitched voice when she was upset, 

09:55.177 --> 09:57.023
her words just eventually became gibberish.

09:57.228 --> 09:58.922
I really do not talk like that. 

09:58.927 --> 10:01.663
I'm getting pretty tired of you guys constantly saying #&#~{

10:01.668 --> 10:03.832
Elliot, sweetie, nobody but me can understand you.

10:03.838 --> 10:05.461
#&$*'&  ?

10:05.475 --> 10:07.221
That's just Turk, you know that's how he is.

10:07.645 --> 10:09.223
You knew she worked here?

10:09.237 --> 10:10.743
I can't believe you kept a secret. 

10:10.746 --> 10:13.280
Remember before your wedding, when you sold me out to Turk?

10:13.345 --> 10:15.670
J.D., you showed up drunk at my shower 

10:15.678 --> 10:17.253
screaming through tears 

10:17.258 --> 10:18.981
that I'd never be as emotionally connected to him as you are.

10:19.037 --> 10:20.433
Turk knew I was joking.

10:20.546 --> 10:22.303
Because we're so emotionally connected!

10:22.355 --> 10:24.453
Elliot, nobody respects clinic doctors.

10:24.528 --> 10:25.442
Really, Turk? 

10:25.447 --> 10:26.750
I think your hernia patient does.

10:27.037 --> 10:29.023
I'm not upset about that!

10:29.265 --> 10:30.460
It's obvious you are.

10:30.635 --> 10:32.353
It's more obvious to me, baby -- I mean Turk.

10:32.706 --> 10:34.121
Look, I know this place isn't the greatest, 

10:34.127 --> 10:35.362
but it's not like I lie awake 

10:35.366 --> 10:36.720
thinking about being yelled at by Dr. Cox 

10:36.768 --> 10:38.330
or playing Jiggly Ball with the orderlies.

10:38.596 --> 10:40.440
How do I not know about this game!?!?

10:40.838 --> 10:42.262
At this clinic, I get to practice medicine 

10:42.268 --> 10:43.962
for people who really need me. 

10:44.448 --> 10:46.491
I mean, honestly I feel like I belong here.

10:47.996 --> 10:49.973
Dr. Cole just got stabbed in the parking lot, 

10:49.985 --> 10:51.073
and we're out of gauze. 

10:51.236 --> 10:52.682
Is it cool if I take lunch?

10:53.245 --> 10:55.290
This place is crushing my soul!

10:58.846 --> 11:00.913
Can you believe Elliot's working in a free clinic?

11:00.957 --> 11:01.860
Who?

11:01.877 --> 11:03.073
Dr. Reid?

11:04.197 --> 11:06.562
I'm sorry, that's just not ringing a bell.

11:07.007 --> 11:09.030
She and J.D. used to sleep together.

11:09.396 --> 11:10.572
"J.D."?

11:10.648 --> 11:12.201
That's not even funny!

11:12.356 --> 11:15.221
Priscilla, I honestly, on my mother's grave, 

11:15.225 --> 11:17.302
thought your real name was Carol.

11:17.997 --> 11:20.341
Whoa, whoa. You wanna hear a weird coincidence? 

11:20.768 --> 11:22.322
The pathology just came back 

11:22.325 --> 11:23.841
on Dr. Kelso's rich patient? 

11:23.845 --> 11:26.053
He has the same brain tumor as your guy, Mr. Morrison.

11:29.296 --> 11:30.840
I don't know why we were running. 

11:30.848 --> 11:33.040
Because I think we both knew that we couldn't change anything.

11:38.487 --> 11:41.511
Because given a choice between a rich guy and a poor guy, 

11:41.535 --> 11:44.111
it was pretty obvious who Bob Kelso would put in the drug trial...

11:45.447 --> 11:47.153
and who he'd leave behind.

11:52.188 --> 11:54.343
Another banner day at Sacred Heart.

11:56.566 --> 11:58.743
A best friend stuck in a crappy job....

12:02.108 --> 12:04.851
A nice guy slowly dying without a fighting chance....

12:07.735 --> 12:11.373
It's a wonder how anyone can walk out of this place with a smile on their face.

12:13.000 --> 12:19.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

12:24.665 --> 12:26.792
We have to help Elliot get her job back.

12:26.887 --> 12:28.912
Honey, there's no money to hire another attending.

12:28.917 --> 12:31.961
Maybe, though. Dr. Bailey was fired last night.

12:31.966 --> 12:33.002
Why?

12:34.205 --> 12:36.952
For this procedure, I'm going to have to numb you...

12:37.755 --> 12:39.571
Num, num, num, num, num, num, num!

12:40.668 --> 12:41.752
You know, 

12:41.756 --> 12:43.373
in Dr. Bailey's defense

12:43.377 --> 12:44.441
No, no, no, no.

12:44.526 --> 12:46.510
- There have been times--
- No.

12:49.957 --> 12:53.400
So anyways, we figured if I offered to do the nursing schedules, 

12:53.408 --> 12:56.433
and these guys volunteered to do extra shifts at the clinic, 

12:56.505 --> 12:58.373
Dr. Kelso might give you your job back!

12:58.487 --> 12:59.650
No, thanks.

12:59.877 --> 13:01.402
Why?

13:03.677 --> 13:06.133
Carla, I can't do your paperwork, I am swamped!.

13:06.136 --> 13:07.791
I got you your job back.

13:09.285 --> 13:11.340
Turk, I am not giving you my last tater-tot!

13:11.345 --> 13:12.811
I got you your job back!

13:14.586 --> 13:16.813
J.D.! I don't care if they're able to successfully attach 

13:16.818 --> 13:18.721
one person's limbs onto another person's body

13:18.857 --> 13:20.792
I am not giving you my hands!

13:20.808 --> 13:22.022
Job back!

13:25.777 --> 13:28.411
Just a beautiful film! Just beautiful!

13:31.765 --> 13:33.073
Corn?

13:33.698 --> 13:36.711
Oh, let me help you. Let me -- I got you. Here you go.

13:38.997 --> 13:41.001
You're tickling your hands! 

13:41.008 --> 13:42.850
- Wait, stop! You're tickling your hands!
- Buttery!

13:43.207 --> 13:45.133
Okay, keep going. I enjoy it, actually.

13:45.905 --> 13:49.011
Ahhh, two and a half years away from chest hands....

13:49.567 --> 13:51.582
 I have to handle this on my own, okay?

13:53.218 --> 13:55.302
See? These are chest hands.

13:55.305 --> 13:56.533
That's what I'm talkin' about.

13:56.536 --> 13:58.670
'Course, yours would be brown....

14:00.627 --> 14:02.253
The next day started poorly. 

14:02.305 --> 14:04.561
I only had eight hours until Kelso's awards dinner, 

14:04.566 --> 14:06.060
and someone else was boxing me out.

14:06.066 --> 14:06.963
Hey, Bob,

14:06.966 --> 14:09.543
I need to talk to you about my drug trial patient?

14:12.678 --> 14:14.440
Ah, we lost him, Newbie.

14:18.887 --> 14:20.343
Bob? 

14:20.736 --> 14:22.262
I can see you.

14:24.316 --> 14:26.623
Oh, for God's sake, 
you're three-dimensional.

14:28.935 --> 14:30.042
It's true, Mr. Keck, 

14:30.045 --> 14:31.713
you could probably get by without the surgery. 

14:32.037 --> 14:33.451
But why would you? 

14:33.485 --> 14:36.370
I'm the smartest, most skilled surgeon in this place!

14:36.448 --> 14:38.391
Are you stuck in that candy machine?

14:39.127 --> 14:41.400
I paid for my Rollos, I'm getting my Rollos!

14:43.855 --> 14:45.301
Nice! 

14:45.535 --> 14:47.503
Why aren't you mocking him?

14:47.595 --> 14:49.532
I dropped a quarter in here.

14:50.836 --> 14:53.473
Guys, listen, we really need to help Elliot.

14:53.475 --> 14:55.230
Baby, she said she doesn't want to be helped.

14:55.238 --> 14:56.670
If J.D. were drowning 

14:56.676 --> 14:58.920
and he told you he didn't want you to save him, wouldn't you do it?

14:58.936 --> 15:00.140
That depends.

15:00.157 --> 15:01.853
What if there're hot chicks at the pool? 

15:01.856 --> 15:03.922
Maybe he wants one of them to jump in and save him?

15:04.067 --> 15:05.551
Let's say there's no women.

15:05.556 --> 15:07.583
There's always women at the pool, baby!

15:07.678 --> 15:08.963
Fine. He's in a pond.

15:08.975 --> 15:10.343
Oh, I would never swim in a pond! 

15:10.348 --> 15:11.840
They're infamous for serpents!

15:11.845 --> 15:14.050
You could swim at the Y on Tuesdays -- men only.

15:14.057 --> 15:16.151
Have you been to the Y on man night? Not me.

15:16.156 --> 15:18.312
N--oka--fine! Turk's the one who's drowning!

15:18.426 --> 15:20.481
Oh! So now a brother can't swim!

15:20.567 --> 15:21.951
Why do you have to go there?

15:21.955 --> 15:23.301
Oh my God! 

15:23.318 --> 15:24.830
I would rather play Jiggly Ball 

15:24.835 --> 15:26.530
than try to explain this to you two idiots.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.280
She's the idiot! 

15:29.465 --> 15:31.092
We're doctors.

15:36.266 --> 15:38.560
Bob, I'm physically touching your arm now.

15:41.086 --> 15:42.942
Oh,  come on, I know you're here.

15:46.707 --> 15:48.541
Oh, hi, Perry! What can I do for you?

15:49.717 --> 15:53.032
Anyway, I just wanted to introduce you to our Chief of Medicine.

15:53.727 --> 15:56.413
Sir, I can't tell you how well everyone's treating me.

15:56.565 --> 15:58.511
That's what we're here for!

16:01.057 --> 16:04.031
You, uh, you forgot to tell him you were bumping him from the drug trial.

16:04.035 --> 16:05.353
I've got work to do, Perry.

16:05.358 --> 16:07.161
You're not going anywhere.

16:17.488 --> 16:19.382
 You hearin' that?

16:22.387 --> 16:24.311
What kinda glass is this!?

16:26.067 --> 16:27.601
Ow....

16:28.776 --> 16:31.141
There was one spot open in the study. 

16:31.257 --> 16:34.201
I gave it to the rich guy because, with the money he's now donating, 

16:34.205 --> 16:36.202
I can reopen the prenatal unit.

16:36.297 --> 16:39.150
What really bothers me is 

16:39.306 --> 16:40.773
that you can look in there at John Morrison, 

16:40.835 --> 16:43.262
a guy you essentially gave a death sentence to

16:44.385 --> 16:46.360
...and just not care..

16:46.938 --> 16:49.310
It's not my job to care, Perry.

16:55.265 --> 16:57.102
Can I talk to you for a second?

16:57.148 --> 16:58.972
No. I'm busy cleaning.

17:02.988 --> 17:04.321
That one always kills.

17:04.355 --> 17:05.492
Remember earlier 

17:05.496 --> 17:07.073
when I told you I'd never heard of Jiggly Ball? 

17:07.078 --> 17:09.550
I was joking. I play it all the time.

17:10.827 --> 17:12.421
I like this. 

17:12.426 --> 17:14.070
It's an idiot handle!

17:14.518 --> 17:15.963
Get off!

17:16.068 --> 17:18.352
As it happens, we're heading out right now to play some Jiggly Ball. 

17:18.515 --> 17:19.691
Are you in?.

17:19.696 --> 17:21.313
Just say no!

17:21.967 --> 17:23.463
Jiggle me in.

17:24.155 --> 17:25.953
All righty, you're gonna go first. 

17:25.955 --> 17:27.462
Please enter the jiggly circle. 

17:28.687 --> 17:30.780
Everybody else, on my signal, 

17:30.787 --> 17:32.282
prepare to throw.

17:35.368 --> 17:36.462
Throw?

17:36.466 --> 17:37.572
Now.

17:45.486 --> 17:47.840
Now, anyone who caught a jiggle rebound 

17:47.845 --> 17:49.761
may step up to the death line!

17:53.895 --> 17:56.583
I want you to think of this as a corn muffin.

18:02.795 --> 18:05.381
There is no such thing as Jiggly Ball, is there....

18:06.176 --> 18:07.503
No.

18:12.006 --> 18:13.763
Guys, why?

18:13.766 --> 18:15.152
The Janitor told us 

18:15.155 --> 18:16.612
that if we pretended to know about Jiggly Ball, 

18:16.615 --> 18:18.063
we get to throw tennis balls at you.

18:18.068 --> 18:19.293
we get to throw tennis balls at you.

18:19.298 --> 18:20.472
Me neither.

18:20.527 --> 18:23.282
I got my shift covered! Heh!

18:27.895 --> 18:30.130
Hey. Kelso's leaving for his award thing, 

18:30.137 --> 18:32.233
so if you want to talk to him about Dr. Reid,

18:32.235 --> 18:33.632
do it now.

18:34.347 --> 18:36.061
I told you guys to leave it alone.

18:36.068 --> 18:38.113
Oh, would you stop being so proud?

18:38.165 --> 18:39.562
<i>I'm</i> proud? Carla! 

18:39.568 --> 18:41.801
After the wedding, you wouldn't even take Turk's name!

18:41.858 --> 18:43.823
I use it for official things!

18:44.056 --> 18:45.551
Letting him call you Mrs. Turk in the bedroom 

18:45.555 --> 18:46.830
isn't official.

18:46.838 --> 18:49.040
But it is officially hot!

18:49.048 --> 18:52.153
And Turk, you freaked out when the hernia patient listened to me over you. 

18:52.156 --> 18:54.641
And J.D.! You just let the entire hospital pummel you with tennis balls 

18:54.648 --> 18:57.832
because you were too proud to admit you didn't know what "Jiggly Ball" was.

18:57.835 --> 19:00.882
I think there may be something wrong with my spine, 

19:00.885 --> 19:02.541
because I'm not doing that.

19:02.558 --> 19:05.420
Elliot, look, we just care about you.

19:06.155 --> 19:08.483
Yeah, well, don't worry about it. I'll get back on top on my own.

19:09.756 --> 19:11.503
Chop-chop, Dorian.

19:16.406 --> 19:18.600
Even though I had no clue what I was gonna say, 

19:18.615 --> 19:20.661
Elliot's attitude inspired me 

19:20.665 --> 19:22.991
to go introduce the hell out of Bob Kelso.

19:24.566 --> 19:27.050
Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Bob Kelso is a--

19:27.056 --> 19:28.680
Thank you, Dr. Dorian!

19:29.837 --> 19:32.400
Thank you so much for this award. 

19:32.558 --> 19:34.523
Delighted to see you all...

19:34.527 --> 19:36.760
Did I say he wanted a long introduction? 

19:36.768 --> 19:38.121
Because Kelso just, 

19:38.338 --> 19:40.331
he just likes when people say his name. 

19:41.697 --> 19:44.030
Hope you didn't obsess too much about that, Newbie.

19:45.145 --> 19:46.301
Over the next few weeks,

19:46.315 --> 19:47.813
I couldn't help thinking 

19:47.816 --> 19:49.443
about what I had planned to say in my speech. 

19:50.067 --> 19:52.420
About how pride defines who we are.

19:54.296 --> 19:56.281
This guy has an S.T.D., 

19:56.287 --> 19:58.753
and he definitely doesn't want his wife to find out.

20:01.806 --> 20:03.010
Crap.

20:03.185 --> 20:05.151
As far as Bob Kelso goes, 

20:05.285 --> 20:07.522
I know sometimes even the good things he does
