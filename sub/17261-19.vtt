(Bertinelli)
<i>Hot in Cleveland</i> is recorded

00:04.629 --> 00:06.464
in front
of a live studio audience.

00:07.882 --> 00:09.801
They cancelled your show?

00:09.884 --> 00:13.596
Yes, the radio station wants
a younger, hipper audience.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.974
{\an3}All I keep hearing is
"younger, younger, younger."

00:16.056 --> 00:20.228
{\an3}Youth is fine when I was young,
but enough is enough.

00:20.311 --> 00:24.774
{\an1}Remind me not to get crotchety
like you when I get old.

00:27.318 --> 00:29.446
{\an3}Well, obviously I'm just gonna
have to reinvent myself,

00:29.529 --> 00:31.239
but I don't want to rush it.

00:31.322 --> 00:34.117
{\an3}I just need to take my time
and do some real soul-searching.

00:34.200 --> 00:37.120
The sign outside
said this place is for sale.

00:37.203 --> 00:38.913
I'll buy it.

00:38.997 --> 00:39.956
What?

00:40.039 --> 00:41.249
I've always thought

00:41.332 --> 00:42.417
running a restaurant
would be fun.

00:42.500 --> 00:43.710
It'll be a new challenge for me.

00:43.793 --> 00:46.463
I already gave you
a new challenge.

00:46.546 --> 00:48.339
Where's my date?

00:48.423 --> 00:51.134
{\an3}Elka is upset that we're not
getting each other dates

00:51.217 --> 00:52.594
for our birthdays this year,

00:52.677 --> 00:54.262
{\an3}because she's found
the perfect guy.

00:54.345 --> 00:55.972
The pope.

00:56.055 --> 00:57.307
The pope?

00:57.390 --> 01:00.685
I'm adorable.
He's infallible.

01:00.769 --> 01:03.354
We could be a power couple.

01:04.897 --> 01:07.776
Look at this.
No, don't look at it.

01:07.859 --> 01:09.986
It's <i> Vanity Fair's</i>
"Where are they now?" issue.

01:10.069 --> 01:11.696
Oh, that's your
favorite issue.

01:11.780 --> 01:13.156
{\an3}That's where you make fun
of all the celebrities

01:13.239 --> 01:15.325
{\an3}who are no longer
relevant--oh.

01:17.368 --> 01:18.828
Well, it is so unfair.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.955
You make a series
of terrible career choices,

01:21.039 --> 01:24.250
and you go from Oscar winner
to nobody just like that.

01:24.334 --> 01:25.960
Oh, I guess I'm just gonna

01:26.044 --> 01:29.130
{\an1}have to think long and hard
about how to reinvent myself.

01:29.214 --> 01:31.508
{\an3}I'm reinventing myself
by buying this restaurant.

01:31.591 --> 01:32.842
I'm in.

01:34.594 --> 01:36.721
All A-listers have
restaurants, you know,

01:36.805 --> 01:38.181
and restaurants
aren't like acting.

01:38.264 --> 01:40.183
They're stable
and profitable.

01:41.601 --> 01:43.061
{\an3}Well, great,
we're gonna be partners.

01:43.144 --> 01:44.145
How about you, Joy?

01:44.229 --> 01:45.814
Oh, I can't right now.

01:45.897 --> 01:48.399
My focus is on Bob and me
adopting the perfect baby,

01:48.483 --> 01:49.818
and we think we've found one.

01:49.901 --> 01:51.569
[phone beeps]

01:51.653 --> 01:54.197
Oh, it's from Chloe,
the mother.

01:54.280 --> 01:57.200
She read my application
and loved it.

01:57.283 --> 01:58.827
"Just one concern.

01:58.910 --> 02:01.496
Detective work
is so dangerous."

02:01.579 --> 02:03.873
"Not a problem.

02:03.957 --> 02:07.085
Just bought a restaurant."

02:07.168 --> 02:08.669
I'm in too.

02:08.752 --> 02:10.839
{\an3}Yay, we're gonna own
this restaurant together!

02:10.922 --> 02:13.758
Oh, let them say,
"Where is Victoria Chase now?"

02:13.842 --> 02:16.553
Because the answer is, "She's
in her fabulous restaurant."

02:16.636 --> 02:19.556
So how are we gonna
make this place fabulous?

02:19.639 --> 02:21.850
Two words:

02:21.933 --> 02:24.561
bacon bowls.

02:24.644 --> 02:26.062
What's that?

02:26.145 --> 02:27.605
Four words:

02:27.689 --> 02:30.900
bowls made of bacon.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.193
{\an3}Yeah, no, I think
we're gonna aim

02:32.277 --> 02:33.736
a little higher than that.

02:33.820 --> 02:35.530
{\an3}I'm gonna start looking
for a hot new chef.

02:35.613 --> 02:38.825
Okay, and I know a fantastic
sommelier back in L.A.,

02:38.908 --> 02:40.910
and he adores me.

02:40.994 --> 02:44.038
Fabrice,
it's your favorite actress.

02:44.122 --> 02:47.625
Victoria Chase?
Is that really you?

02:47.709 --> 02:49.919
Oh, I was just telling everyone
how much I adore you

02:50.003 --> 02:51.254
and miss you.

02:51.337 --> 02:53.631
Oh, ma cherie,
I totally miss you too.

02:53.715 --> 02:55.425
{\an1}I'm opening a restaurant
in Cleveland,

02:55.508 --> 02:58.428
{\an1}and I can't imagine doing it
without you by my side.

02:58.511 --> 03:00.305
What are you saying, Victoria?

03:00.388 --> 03:01.598
I'm saying I want you.

03:01.681 --> 03:04.309
I want you here.
I want you now.

03:04.392 --> 03:06.769
I will do it for you.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.065
She loves me.

{\an7}I invited Chloe,
my baby mama.

03:26.664 --> 03:28.458
{\an7}Turns out she's a foodie,
so it's perfect.

03:28.541 --> 03:33.171
{\an9}Victoria, I've chosen this
for the first course,

03:33.254 --> 03:36.007
{\an9}an elegant Californian
with great legs,

03:36.090 --> 03:38.843
{\an8}just like you, cherie.

03:38.927 --> 03:40.762
{\an7}Oh...vous.

{\an9}Oh, isn't it great the way
you can flirt with Frenchmen

03:47.393 --> 03:49.854
{\an9}and it means
absolutely nothing?

03:49.938 --> 03:53.191
{\an8}I'm going to marry that woman.

03:53.274 --> 03:54.484
{\an8}Look at him.

03:54.567 --> 03:55.777
{\an8}I still can't believe

03:55.860 --> 03:58.363
{\an7}I got Martha Stewart's
personal chef.

03:58.446 --> 04:00.031
{\an7}Everything smells great,
Kameron.

04:00.114 --> 04:01.991
{\an8}- Thank you.
- Wow.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.660
{\an8}So you cooked for all those
big parties Martha threw.

04:03.743 --> 04:06.329
{\an8}God, no.
I only cooked for her.

04:06.412 --> 04:09.123
{\an7}But you've cooked
in a restaurant before.

04:09.207 --> 04:10.166
{\an8}Nope.

04:10.249 --> 04:11.709
{\an8}This is pretty cool.

04:13.127 --> 04:15.004
{\an8}I like this big fridge.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.966
{\an8}Melanie, you hired a chef

04:18.048 --> 04:20.009
{\an7}who's never cooked
for more than one person?

04:20.093 --> 04:22.011
{\an8}I don't know; all I heard was
"Martha Stewart,"

04:22.095 --> 04:23.972
{\an8}and I thought,
"It's a good thing."

04:25.848 --> 04:29.018
{\an9}Well, thank God someone
competent hired the wait staff.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.895
{\an8}They're all actors,

04:30.979 --> 04:32.814
{\an9}and I didn't think I could
get them, with open auditions

04:32.897 --> 04:35.149
{\an8}for <i> Book of Mormon</i>
right around the corner.

04:35.233 --> 04:39.696
{\an8}- Wait! No! Wait!
- Oh, no!

04:39.779 --> 04:41.698
{\an8}- We lost our wait staff.
- This is a disaster.

04:41.781 --> 04:44.325
{\an8}Ladies, please, stop yelling.

04:44.409 --> 04:47.412
{\an8}I can't handle it when
a middle-aged woman is yelling.

04:47.495 --> 04:49.163
{\an8}That's why Martha fired me.

04:49.247 --> 04:50.873
both: She fired you?

04:50.957 --> 04:53.459
Middle-aged?

04:53.543 --> 04:56.045
Stop yelling.
I can't cook if you're yelling.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.089
Kameron, Kameron,
everything's fine.

04:58.172 --> 04:59.924
We're all calmed down.

05:01.300 --> 05:05.179
We don't have any waiters.

05:05.263 --> 05:06.723
And our chef
is unstable.

05:06.806 --> 05:10.393
And we open in 15 minutes.

{\an3}Elka, why did you bring
George Clooney?

05:51.017 --> 05:52.769
{\an3}It's a health code
violation.

I want to get him blessed
by the pope.

05:55.813 --> 05:59.734
{\an3}I told you,
the pope is not coming.

05:59.817 --> 06:01.944
{\an1}Did you send that picture
I gave you?

06:02.028 --> 06:05.573
Yes, and as a Catholic,
I have to tell you

06:05.656 --> 06:08.993
that I was very uncomfortable
sending that to the Vatican.

06:10.411 --> 06:12.705
If you sent it, he'll be here.

{\an3}I am so excited
about your new restaurant,

06:50.284 --> 06:52.411
especially your chef,
who is using some...

06:52.495 --> 06:54.205
[talking inaudibly]

06:56.290 --> 06:59.001
{\an1}Forgive me. I think
I missed that last part.

06:59.085 --> 07:00.461
{\an3}Oh, I'm sorry,
it's just that when

07:00.545 --> 07:02.547
{\an3}I heard that Victoria Chase
was one of the owners,

07:02.630 --> 07:04.674
{\an3}I thought, "Well, this is gonna
be one of the biggest..."

07:04.757 --> 07:08.136
[talking inaudibly]

07:09.720 --> 07:12.473
{\an3}It's so great that
you're opening a restaurant.

07:12.557 --> 07:15.852
{\an3}I was thinking about being a
chef myself when I was younger.

07:15.935 --> 07:17.186
{\an1}Well, it was time
for a change.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.480
{\an1}The detective business
was so dangerous.

07:19.564 --> 07:21.691
I'm so relieved
to hear you say that.

07:21.774 --> 07:23.192
It's really important to me

07:23.276 --> 07:26.028
that the baby be raised
in a safe environment.

07:26.112 --> 07:28.114
No place safer
than a restaurant.

07:34.829 --> 07:36.455
So will your fiancé
be here soon?

07:36.539 --> 07:37.832
Oh, unfortunately, no.

07:37.915 --> 07:39.542
{\an1}He's out of the country
on business.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.335
Oh, he's not coming?

07:41.419 --> 07:42.879
I'm sorry, Joy.

07:42.962 --> 07:43.838
{\an3}I'm gonna need
to meet him too.

07:43.921 --> 07:45.506
And full disclosure,

07:45.590 --> 07:47.508
there's another couple
interested in the baby,

07:47.592 --> 07:49.760
and I like them very much.

07:49.844 --> 07:51.637
Wait, no! Brring!

07:51.721 --> 07:54.390
Oh, a text.

07:54.473 --> 07:57.768
{\an1}Bob's back in the country
and in the kitchen.

07:57.852 --> 07:59.395
I'll go get him.

07:59.478 --> 08:02.190
You're gonna love him.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.401
- I need a fiancé.
- What?

08:05.484 --> 08:08.070
Chloe is gonna leave
unless I produce Bob.

08:08.154 --> 08:10.406
{\an1}Got it.
Uh, Fabrice, my love.

08:10.489 --> 08:13.242
Would you pretend to be
Joy's fiancé for the evening?

08:13.326 --> 08:16.204
Would that make you
love me even more?

08:16.287 --> 08:17.914
How could I love you
even more?

08:17.997 --> 08:18.998
Then I don't have to do it?

08:19.081 --> 08:20.166
Yes, you have to do it.

08:24.003 --> 08:25.588
The restaurant critic is here.

08:25.671 --> 08:27.423
{\an1}Oh, great, I'll go
out there and charm him

08:27.506 --> 08:29.050
so we get a good review.

08:29.133 --> 08:30.718
{\an3}Okay, but just so you know,
he's a trailer-offer.

08:30.801 --> 08:31.969
A trailer-offer?

08:32.053 --> 08:33.638
Yeah, he starts strong,

08:33.721 --> 08:36.140
{\an3}but his voice trails off,
and then he peters out.

08:36.224 --> 08:39.602
{\an1}So he's a trailer-offer
peter-outer.

08:39.684 --> 08:40.394
Got it.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.901
{\an3}Kameron,
where's the kitchen staff?

08:46.984 --> 08:48.653
- I fired them.
- What?

08:48.736 --> 08:50.780
{\an1}They kept saying things like,
"Where's the food?

08:50.863 --> 08:52.573
People are hungry."

08:52.657 --> 08:54.909
{\an1}Is that what happens
in a normal restaurant?

08:54.992 --> 08:57.411
'Cause it is really stressful.

08:57.495 --> 08:59.997
{\an3}So you're gonna do
everything yourself?

09:00.081 --> 09:01.791
{\an1}Yeah, it'll just take
a little longer.

09:01.874 --> 09:03.584
Taste.

09:04.835 --> 09:06.629
{\an3}Oh, my God.

09:06.712 --> 09:09.173
That is the most amazing
thing I've ever tasted.

09:09.257 --> 09:11.259
Nope. It's overseasoned.

09:11.342 --> 09:13.094
{\an3}Oh, no!
That was the first course!

09:13.177 --> 09:14.512
Are you out of your mind?

09:14.595 --> 09:15.972
{\an3}I'm sorry.
Just stop yelling at me.

09:16.055 --> 09:17.640
Okay, okay, Kameron.

09:17.723 --> 09:19.809
{\an1}Kameron, everything's fine.
Everything's fine.

09:19.892 --> 09:21.477
You can do this, okay?

09:21.560 --> 09:23.187
{\an1}I'm gonna be here with you
every step of the way,

09:23.271 --> 09:25.064
{\an1}so let's just make
something new, shall we?

09:25.147 --> 09:26.649
You just tell me what you need.

09:26.732 --> 09:28.317
Okay.

09:28.401 --> 09:29.819
{\an3}Grab that frying pan
for me down there.

09:29.902 --> 09:30.820
Okay, frying pan.

09:30.903 --> 09:33.114
Which pan? This one?

09:47.503 --> 09:50.131
{\an3}Oh, Elka,
you're such a charming woman,

09:50.214 --> 09:52.800
{\an3}but you know
this can never be.

09:52.883 --> 09:56.846
{\an1}Back in the day,
popes got married.

09:56.929 --> 09:59.515
{\an3}What you say
makes a lot of sense.

09:59.598 --> 10:02.601
{\an3}I don't know
if it's the champagne

10:02.685 --> 10:06.147
or your smile talking.

10:07.606 --> 10:10.318
Let's get you more of both.

10:11.485 --> 10:13.654
Ross Michaels.

10:13.738 --> 10:14.697
I know I'm just one star,

10:14.780 --> 10:16.365
but I hope you'll give me four.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.075
{\an3}Oh!

10:18.159 --> 10:19.702
Well, I have to tell you
that my first impression

10:19.785 --> 10:22.496
{\an3}of your restaurant is that it
is a very nice environment,

10:22.580 --> 10:23.664
{\an3}and I'm....

10:23.748 --> 10:26.375
[talking inaudibly]

10:26.459 --> 10:29.879
{\an1}Well, you don't hear that
every day.

10:29.962 --> 10:31.380
What's going on there?

10:31.464 --> 10:33.716
Why are they flirting?

10:33.799 --> 10:35.384
Get your head in the game.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.845
We need to convince Chloe
that we deserve that baby.

10:37.928 --> 10:39.847
{\an1}But I have no interest
in children.

10:39.930 --> 10:41.724
{\an3}Well, then think of something
you are interested in,

10:41.807 --> 10:43.976
{\an3}and pretend
you're talking about that.

10:44.060 --> 10:47.813
Oh. Ooh, got it.

10:49.982 --> 10:53.235
Chloe,
this is my fiancé, Bob.

10:53.319 --> 10:56.238
I was just telling Chloe
how much you love children.

10:56.322 --> 10:57.865
Yes, yes, yes.

10:57.948 --> 11:00.409
{\an1}I'm particularly passionate
about the babies

11:00.493 --> 11:04.121
{\an1}currently being produced
in the Napa Valley.

11:06.332 --> 11:08.918
That's so specific.

11:09.001 --> 11:10.920
Bob loves kids
from all regions.

11:11.003 --> 11:14.423
{\an1}Yes, but they must have
a good, strong nose,

11:14.507 --> 11:16.884
{\an1}and of course
you want them to breathe.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.471
Is that even a question?

11:20.554 --> 11:22.473
{\an1}And I know it's not
the popular thing to say,

11:22.556 --> 11:25.893
but I prefer the white ones.

11:28.687 --> 11:29.730
Kameron?

11:29.814 --> 11:31.732
Kameron, buddy, wake up.

11:31.816 --> 11:33.901
Maybe a little wine.

11:40.741 --> 11:42.618
Yeah, that's better.

11:42.701 --> 11:45.287
Don't you have a call
to make, darling?

11:45.371 --> 11:46.622
[phone beeps]

11:46.705 --> 11:47.957
Oh, would you excuse me?

11:48.040 --> 11:49.959
I'm needed in the kitchen.

11:51.544 --> 11:52.628
[phone beeps]

11:52.711 --> 11:53.963
Oh, excuse me.

11:54.046 --> 11:56.257
Hold that thought.
Or just keep talking.

11:56.340 --> 11:58.092
I can't tell the difference.

11:59.343 --> 12:00.469
You knocked out our chef?

12:00.553 --> 12:02.388
What will we
serve people?

12:02.471 --> 12:03.639
Well, most of the crab

12:03.722 --> 12:04.807
ended up in a big clump
in the trash.

12:04.890 --> 12:06.267
Maybe we could still use it?

12:07.393 --> 12:08.644
Five-minute rule, right?

12:08.727 --> 12:10.438
{\an3}I thought it was
the five-second rule.

12:10.521 --> 12:12.481
Not tonight.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.358
- Slap.
- Dump.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.318
- Squirt.
- Slap.

12:16.402 --> 12:17.987
- Dump.
- Squirt.

12:18.070 --> 12:19.655
{\an1}Wait, wait, wait.
Shouldn't we be wearing gloves?

12:19.738 --> 12:22.783
{\an3}Really?
Now, Melanie?

12:22.867 --> 12:23.826
- Slap.
- Dump.

12:23.909 --> 12:26.328
{\an1}Oh, shoot,
I dropped the crab.

12:26.412 --> 12:27.913
George Clooney got it.

12:27.997 --> 12:29.999
{\an3}It's okay. We're done.
Let's go.

12:30.082 --> 12:31.208
Well, we did it.

12:31.292 --> 12:32.626
We served
the appetizers.

12:32.710 --> 12:35.921
This just might work.

12:36.005 --> 12:37.506
(Melanie)
Oh, poor George Clooney.

12:37.590 --> 12:41.719
Honey, what did you eat
that made you so sick?

12:41.802 --> 12:43.637
Oh, no. The crab.

12:43.721 --> 12:46.765
All right, we've got
to un-serve those appetizers.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.314
Let me get this
out of your way.

12:53.397 --> 12:55.649
Hope you enjoyed it.

12:55.733 --> 12:57.485
Oh, save room
for your entrée.

12:57.568 --> 13:00.654
Oh, look, it's Gordon Ramsay.

13:07.495 --> 13:08.746
This is a nightmare.

13:08.829 --> 13:11.207
{\an3}We need to turn
this around fast.

13:11.290 --> 13:12.625
{\an3}I've already gotten press
for being a failure.

13:12.708 --> 13:14.460
{\an3}I need this
to be successful.

13:14.543 --> 13:15.878
(Melanie)
Oh, Kameron's coming to.

13:15.961 --> 13:17.171
I'll help him with the entrée.

13:17.254 --> 13:18.547
You go back to be with Chloe,

13:18.631 --> 13:19.840
{\an1}and you go back to charming
that critic.

13:19.924 --> 13:22.051
- Good plan.
- This just might work.

13:22.134 --> 13:23.594
both: Stop saying that!

13:27.264 --> 13:29.391
Fabrice, how could you
leave Chloe alone?

13:29.475 --> 13:31.101
- She's not alone.
- What?

13:31.185 --> 13:33.020
{\an3}She's with the other couple
who wants the baby.

13:33.103 --> 13:34.772
What? Let's go, Bob.

13:37.483 --> 13:39.818
Hey, buddy, good nap?

13:39.902 --> 13:42.071
Why does my face hurt?

13:42.154 --> 13:43.531
{\an3}I don't know.
'm not a doctor.

13:43.614 --> 13:44.949
Come on, now.

13:45.032 --> 13:46.408
Let's get started
on those entrées.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.577
We got 30 customers
waiting out there.

13:48.661 --> 13:49.537
30?

13:49.620 --> 13:51.247
That's a lot of people.

13:51.330 --> 13:55.751
{\an3}Well, just think of it as
cooking for one person 30 times.

13:55.834 --> 13:58.754
You know, I always intended to
cook for more than one person.

13:58.837 --> 14:01.090
A long time ago,
I cooked for two.

14:01.173 --> 14:02.591
- There was this girl...
- A girl.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.718
I bet she was pretty
and--and tender,

14:04.802 --> 14:08.806
with an inch of fat
like these pork chops.

14:08.889 --> 14:12.226
So, Chloe, I didn't realize
you were expecting anyone else.

14:12.309 --> 14:14.270
Well, I wasn't, but Gil and
Heidi just happened to show up.

14:14.353 --> 14:15.771
(Gil)
Well, the other day,

14:15.854 --> 14:17.731
Chloe mentioned that
the older, unmarried woman

14:17.815 --> 14:21.652
who also wants the baby--
I guess that's you--

14:21.735 --> 14:24.280
owned a restaurant,
so we just had to try it.

14:24.363 --> 14:26.156
Oh, how nice.

14:26.240 --> 14:29.285
{\an3}Although I can't help noticing
you already have a baby.

14:29.368 --> 14:31.287
Oh, no, this is my nephew.

14:31.370 --> 14:34.039
He's usually fussy,
but Heidi's a baby whisperer.

14:34.123 --> 14:35.791
She's amazing with kids.

14:35.874 --> 14:37.626
I am too.
Right, Bob?

14:37.710 --> 14:39.044
Yes, I am Bob.

14:44.049 --> 14:46.844
In fact, just now
I whispered a baby

14:46.927 --> 14:49.763
to sleep in the kitchen
for our cook.

14:49.847 --> 14:50.931
{\an1}(Gil)
Really?

14:51.015 --> 14:52.308
I'd love to see that baby.

14:52.391 --> 14:53.642
Yeah, I would too.

14:53.726 --> 14:54.977
I think we all would.

14:55.060 --> 14:57.605
And so you shall.

15:00.065 --> 15:01.984
I need a baby.

15:08.073 --> 15:09.658
What do you mean,
you need a baby?

15:09.742 --> 15:10.993
I told Chloe
I'm amazing with babies

15:11.076 --> 15:12.328
and that I had one
in the kitchen.

15:12.411 --> 15:14.663
Oh, God, where am I gonna find
something in here

15:14.747 --> 15:17.291
that looks like a baby?

15:17.374 --> 15:19.501
Oh, hello.

15:21.503 --> 15:23.297
Where the hell is the food?

15:23.380 --> 15:25.174
{\an3}It's coming.
Just go flirt with the critic.

15:25.257 --> 15:27.343
You think
I haven't been doing that?

15:27.426 --> 15:29.845
I haven't laughed so hard
at things I don't understand

15:29.928 --> 15:33.474
since my screen test
with Jackie Chan.

15:35.934 --> 15:39.730
Where's the grub?
My boyfriend's hungry.

15:39.813 --> 15:42.483
{\an3}The pope
is not your boyfriend.

15:42.566 --> 15:47.655
He just tweeted he's thinking
about relaxing some rules.

15:49.865 --> 15:52.701
#blessed.

15:54.620 --> 15:55.829
Okay, the sooner
you're out of here,

15:55.913 --> 15:57.164
the sooner the food will come.

15:57.247 --> 15:58.415
Come on, everybody, out.

15:58.499 --> 16:00.250
Here's my baby.
What do you think?

16:00.334 --> 16:01.960
The legs are hanging out.

16:09.968 --> 16:12.388
{\an1}You're gonna make
a great mom.

16:12.471 --> 16:14.098
I need a head.

16:18.143 --> 16:21.397
You are as delightful
as you are handsome.

16:21.480 --> 16:24.441
Oh, thank you, but if the food
doesn't come soon, I am sorry,

16:24.525 --> 16:26.902
{\an3}but I might have to leave,
and in my review,

16:26.985 --> 16:29.571
{\an3}I am going to have to say
that the service....

16:29.655 --> 16:31.573
[talking inaudibly]

16:32.950 --> 16:34.743
{\an1}Ross, if you could eat
your own charm,

16:34.827 --> 16:36.870
you'd never go hungry.

16:38.997 --> 16:40.457
She's asleep now,

16:40.541 --> 16:43.419
but she wasn't five minutes ago,
right, Bob?

16:43.502 --> 16:44.670
Bob?

16:44.753 --> 16:46.338
{\an3}Why is she holding
his hand?

16:46.422 --> 16:50.092
{\an3}She's driving me mad
with jealousy.

16:50.175 --> 16:51.427
{\an3}Do we know
when the food's coming?

16:51.510 --> 16:53.137
I'm starving.

16:53.220 --> 16:55.806
You know, a woman that forgets
to feed her customers

16:55.889 --> 16:58.225
might forget to feed a baby
as well.

16:58.308 --> 17:00.602
{\an1}Don't be ridiculous.
It's nearly here.

17:00.686 --> 17:01.895
Oh, here it is.

17:01.979 --> 17:03.772
We finally got one done.
He is so slow.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.607
Okay, I need this
for the critic.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.608
{\an3}No, I need that
for my baby.

17:07.693 --> 17:09.903
{\an3}Please, God,
a little food.

17:16.367 --> 17:18.162
You're good.

17:19.913 --> 17:21.957
Now you're giving him
the lap dance?

17:22.040 --> 17:23.250
I thought you only loved me.

17:23.333 --> 17:24.460
What?

17:24.542 --> 17:26.670
{\an1}Oh, Fabrice, look,
I know that we flirted,

17:26.753 --> 17:28.630
but I'm not in love with you.

17:28.714 --> 17:30.132
I left my job

17:30.215 --> 17:32.801
{\an3}at the best restaurant
in L.A. for you.

17:32.885 --> 17:37.681
Even worse, I pretend to be the
fiancé of this desperate woman.

17:37.765 --> 17:39.516
I've had enough.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.144
See you at home, Bob.

17:45.022 --> 17:47.649
Look, Chloe, I can explain.

17:47.733 --> 17:48.776
{\an1}(Kameron)
I forgot the garnish.

17:51.737 --> 17:52.613
Kameron.

17:52.696 --> 17:54.531
Chloe?

17:54.615 --> 17:55.866
Is that really you?

17:55.949 --> 17:57.618
You two know each other?

17:57.701 --> 18:00.370
Yeah, we went to culinary
school together in Paris,

18:00.454 --> 18:02.539
and we fell in love,

18:02.623 --> 18:03.999
but then we lost touch.

18:04.082 --> 18:05.501
Wait, she's the girl?

18:05.584 --> 18:07.669
{\an1}She is.

18:07.753 --> 18:08.879
But you're married.

18:08.962 --> 18:10.339
No, no, I'm not,

18:10.422 --> 18:13.091
and I was gonna give
this baby up for adoption.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.718
That's right, to us.

18:14.802 --> 18:16.095
No, to me.

18:16.178 --> 18:17.846
Look, that wasn't my fiancé.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.973
I told one little lie.

18:20.057 --> 18:22.351
[sniffs]
Do I smell roast chicken?

18:22.434 --> 18:25.395
Oh, my God,
my baby's on fire.

18:29.817 --> 18:32.444
Okay, two little lies.

18:37.741 --> 18:39.326
Wow, what a night.

18:39.409 --> 18:42.371
How about we go somewhere
where it's dark and quiet?

18:42.454 --> 18:45.040
{\an3}So I can hear
your confession?

18:45.124 --> 18:46.834
Sure.

18:46.917 --> 18:50.504
{\an1}After we've done something
worth confessing about.

18:53.131 --> 18:55.425
So I come to Rome.

18:55.509 --> 18:57.344
Tell me about our perfect date.

18:57.427 --> 19:01.223
{\an3}Well, we kick off the night
with theology study,

19:01.306 --> 19:06.436
{\an3}then, if you're up for it,
wash the feet of some lepers.

19:06.520 --> 19:09.022
How does that sound?

19:09.106 --> 19:12.776
{\an1}Oh, I just remembered
I've got a thing.

19:12.860 --> 19:16.238
{\an3}Are you breaking up
with me?

19:16.321 --> 19:19.533
I want to see other papal.

19:22.077 --> 19:24.788
I'm actually happy Chloe
and Kameron got together

19:24.872 --> 19:26.248
{\an3}and decided to keep
the baby.

19:26.331 --> 19:29.251
{\an3}And whatever baby
Bob and I end up with

19:29.334 --> 19:30.085
will be the perfect one.

19:30.168 --> 19:32.337
{\an1}It will.

19:32.421 --> 19:35.090
Well, I dumped the pope.

19:38.135 --> 19:39.761
What happened?

19:39.845 --> 19:42.931
Oh, it would never have
worked out.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.433
I'm a dog person.

19:44.516 --> 19:46.977
He's a leper person.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.731
{\an1}Well, some things
just aren't meant to be.

19:50.814 --> 19:52.608
{\an1}I mean, I did
to this restaurant

19:52.691 --> 19:54.151
{\an1}what the radio station
did to me:

19:54.234 --> 19:57.112
change something
that was working.

19:57.195 --> 19:59.072
{\an1}So let's just keep it
the way it was.

19:59.156 --> 20:00.449
Agreed.

20:00.532 --> 20:02.242
And why did I go so crazy

20:02.326 --> 20:05.037
about that <i> Vanity Fair</i>
"Where is she now?" thing?

20:05.120 --> 20:06.955
I mean, I know where I am.

20:07.039 --> 20:10.250
I'm right here
with my friends.

20:10.334 --> 20:14.630
Plus, I had two men
fighting over me.

20:14.713 --> 20:18.133
Was one of them
the pope?

20:18.216 --> 20:19.134
No.

20:19.217 --> 20:20.135
I win.

20:20.218 --> 20:23.555
[laughter]

20:23.639 --> 20:24.848
- Cheers.
