Auntie Chartreux?

00:36.000 --> 00:40.839

00:41.080 --> 00:44.600

<i>Next time you should come!</i>

00:44.760 --> 00:46.280
Huh?

00:46.400 --> 00:49.080
Thanks, but I think
I'd rather enjoy the postcard!

00:49.199 --> 00:52.879
<i>Oh! It's my turn to cliff dive!</i>
<i>Gotta go. See you tomorrow!</i>

00:53.000 --> 00:53.960
Bye!

00:55.400 --> 00:57.519
Wait. Tomorrow?

00:57.919 --> 00:59.279
[gasps]

00:59.400 --> 01:01.279
It's our Japanese sushi lunch!

01:01.599 --> 01:03.199
Oh, no, no, no!

01:03.320 --> 01:06.160
No, no, no, no, no!

01:06.320 --> 01:08.640
Ollie? Everything OK?

01:09.000 --> 01:10.880
-I forgot!
-Forgot what?

01:11.000 --> 01:13.080
I'm supposed to eat Japanese sushi.

01:13.240 --> 01:15.840
You know, raw fish, with Aunty Char.

01:15.960 --> 01:19.200
And I'm supposed to use these
to eat the raw fish!

01:19.320 --> 01:22.960
Oh, what beautiful,
special chopsticks, Ollie!

01:23.119 --> 01:24.240
Can I try?

01:26.320 --> 01:28.920
They were a birthday present
from Auntie Char,

01:29.080 --> 01:30.720
and I forgot to learn how to use them.

01:30.880 --> 01:33.520
No problem. See? It's easy!

01:34.440 --> 01:36.800
For you, maybe. But when I do it...

01:41.199 --> 01:44.240
Why can't I use chopsticks
as well as you?

01:44.399 --> 01:46.640
Oh, I wish I'd been born in Japan.

01:46.759 --> 01:48.679
Then I'd already know how to eat
sushi with chopsticks!

01:49.320 --> 01:51.320
Ollie! I'm having a brainstorm!

01:51.479 --> 01:54.160
Uh-oh. When you have a brainstorm,

01:54.280 --> 01:56.360
I always get dragged off someplace!

01:56.520 --> 01:57.759
Let's go to Japan!

01:59.039 --> 02:00.000
I changed my mind.

02:00.119 --> 02:02.600
I do not need to learn
how to eat with chopsticks.

02:02.720 --> 02:04.880
But you could learn so fast there!

02:05.000 --> 02:08.160
Everybody in Japan has been
eating raw fish with chopsticks

02:08.280 --> 02:10.519
since they were little!
They can teach you!

02:10.799 --> 02:13.880
Well, I would like to make
Auntie Char happy,

02:14.000 --> 02:15.920
-but Japan sounds...
-Fun?

02:16.040 --> 02:18.720
Fabulous? Fantastic?

02:18.880 --> 02:20.239
I was going to say "far".

02:20.359 --> 02:22.880
Come on! It'll be so easy!

02:23.040 --> 02:25.040
We'll be back before she gets here!

02:33.440 --> 02:34.799
Whee!

02:42.880 --> 02:46.239
<i>Everybody, say hello to Japan!</i>

02:46.400 --> 02:48.720
<i>Konnichiwa, Japan!</i>

02:51.079 --> 02:53.200
Wow!

02:53.359 --> 02:55.840
The lights! The noise!

02:55.959 --> 02:58.519
The lights. The noise!

02:58.679 --> 03:00.760
And our chopsticks lesson!

03:02.160 --> 03:03.239
Come on!

03:07.840 --> 03:10.200
And look at him eating sushi!

03:10.359 --> 03:12.399
Not bad for a guy with flippers.

03:13.320 --> 03:15.640
Yeah! OK. I can do this!

03:20.760 --> 03:22.040
<i>Konnichiwa!</i>

03:22.160 --> 03:23.720
Hello! I'm Hiroki!

03:23.880 --> 03:25.519
[Ollie sighs]
And you need help!

03:25.679 --> 03:27.320
I do! And fast!

03:27.480 --> 03:30.320
I need to eat sushi with chopsticks
tomorrow at lunch!

03:30.480 --> 03:32.679
Pretend it's a pencil!
That's the easy way.

03:32.840 --> 03:34.760
-Easy, easy, easy!
-Hmm?

03:34.920 --> 03:38.440
Um, excuse me,
but he needs to eat, not write!

03:38.600 --> 03:41.560
[laughs]
No, hold the top one like a pencil

03:41.720 --> 03:42.799
and pinch, pinch, pinch!

03:43.200 --> 03:44.880
Wow! Good idea, Hiroki!

03:48.840 --> 03:49.840
Go! Go! Go!

03:52.760 --> 03:53.959
Aw.

03:59.799 --> 04:01.399
[Hiroki] <i>Iku! Iku! Iku!</i>

04:02.079 --> 04:04.280
Come on, Ollie!
Everyone's cheering for you!

04:04.399 --> 04:07.040
Ollie! Ollie! Ollie!

04:07.239 --> 04:09.480
[everybody]
Ollie! Ollie! Ollie!

04:09.959 --> 04:12.280
Ollie! Ollie!

04:15.920 --> 04:18.680
[cheering]

04:22.079 --> 04:25.240
You learned to eat sushi
with chopsticks, Ol!

04:25.400 --> 04:27.080
Thank you for teaching me, Hiroki!

04:27.240 --> 04:29.240
I am honoured to have taught you.

04:30.280 --> 04:32.440
Auntie Chartreux is going to be so proud!

04:32.960 --> 04:33.800
I did it!

04:37.599 --> 04:41.000
[gasps] Your chopsticks landed
in the robes of Mighty Tah-Shue,

04:41.159 --> 04:43.280
the famous, famous, famous sumo wrestler!

04:43.440 --> 04:44.840
What are sumo wrestlers?

04:44.960 --> 04:47.200
Powerful athletes
who wrestle-wrestle-wrestle

04:47.400 --> 04:49.080
till one goes outside the ring.

04:49.240 --> 04:51.320
It's the most amazing sport
ever-ever-ever!

04:51.520 --> 04:53.919
Mighty Tah-Shue is the best!

04:54.039 --> 04:55.760
And he's also leaving!

04:56.680 --> 04:57.800
Oh, no, no, no!

04:57.960 --> 05:00.800
-Yoo-hoo, Mr. Wrestler!
-Shh!

05:01.440 --> 05:04.280
You mustn't disturb Mighty Tah-Shue.

05:04.400 --> 05:06.320
He needs his quiet time.

05:09.159 --> 05:11.080
[gasps] This is a awful!

05:11.240 --> 05:12.640
This is an adventure!

05:12.800 --> 05:15.120
But I lost my special chopsticks!

05:15.280 --> 05:17.760
What good is knowing how
to use them when I've lost them?

05:17.880 --> 05:19.719
You didn't lose them, Ollie.

05:20.360 --> 05:23.520
But we can't get near them
thanks to that shushing bodyguard!

05:23.640 --> 05:26.760
Wait!
I'm having another brainstorm!

05:26.919 --> 05:29.320
Uh-oh. The last time you had brainstorm,

05:29.479 --> 05:32.080
-we got into a mighty mess!
-But look, Ollie!

05:32.240 --> 05:35.359
They have vending machines
for everything here in Japan!

05:35.479 --> 05:37.680
There must be something in here
that can help us.

05:43.120 --> 05:45.560
-Look, <i>wagasas</i>!
-Wa-what-whats?

05:45.719 --> 05:48.919
<i>Wagasas</i>, they're traditional
Japanese umbrellas!

05:49.039 --> 05:51.120
And they're perfect! Come on!

05:59.680 --> 06:00.520
Here's the plan.

06:00.640 --> 06:04.359
We inch up to him,
grab the chopsticks and run!

06:04.599 --> 06:07.880
[Ollie groans]

06:09.680 --> 06:11.840
See how easy this plan is?

06:12.000 --> 06:14.880
For you! My umbrella won't open.

06:24.760 --> 06:26.719
[they shout]

06:29.400 --> 06:30.719
Phew!

06:31.400 --> 06:32.840
All right, vending machine.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.440
I'm counting on you
for another brainstorm.

06:35.599 --> 06:38.479
And make it fast! We need to get
those chopsticks back!

06:42.760 --> 06:45.640
-A couple of <i>ogi</i>!
-You mean, hand fans?

06:45.799 --> 06:47.560
Yes! We'll hide behind them

06:47.719 --> 06:51.159
and while I keep the guard busy,
you grab the chopsticks!

06:51.320 --> 06:53.280
-Easy!
-That's what you think!

06:53.440 --> 06:55.000
I think it sounds hard.

06:55.159 --> 06:57.599
Eating sushi with a fork
is looking better and better.

07:03.320 --> 07:05.719
Excuse me, could I have an autograph?

07:05.880 --> 07:07.080
No autographs.

07:07.479 --> 07:10.440
Oh, not from
the Mighty Tah-Shue, from you!

07:10.599 --> 07:11.840
Me?

07:12.919 --> 07:15.640
Please write: "To my biggest fan...

07:16.280 --> 07:20.400
who, er, really enjoys
the body-guard profession..."

07:24.400 --> 07:25.640
[whispers] Hurry up!

07:25.760 --> 07:28.719
"Especially the fabulous
sunglasses and, uh..."

07:28.880 --> 07:30.400
Yikes!

07:31.159 --> 07:33.120
-Oh, no!
-Hmm.

07:37.440 --> 07:39.599
Now how are we going to find him in time?

07:39.760 --> 07:41.400
The city's so huge!

07:41.560 --> 07:43.960
Oh, Auntie Char will be so sad.

07:44.120 --> 07:46.159
My chopsticks are gone forever!

07:46.280 --> 07:47.760
I wouldn't be so sure.

07:47.880 --> 07:48.719
Hiroki!

07:48.840 --> 07:50.719
I know where he's going. Look!
Up, up, up!

07:52.039 --> 07:54.599
Tonight only! The match of the century!

07:54.760 --> 07:57.080
The Mighty Tah-Shue
takes on all challengers!

07:57.280 --> 08:00.120
-Sumo, sumo, sumo!
-See?

08:00.280 --> 08:02.239
All we have to do is get into the match!

08:02.359 --> 08:03.479
It'll be easy!

08:03.599 --> 08:06.280
It doesn't sound easy. How?

08:06.440 --> 08:11.679
Yes, how? The match is totally,
totally, totally sold out.

08:11.840 --> 08:13.039
Wait!

08:18.520 --> 08:19.520
Ta-da!

08:19.719 --> 08:20.840
[sighs]

08:22.239 --> 08:24.760
An inflatable sumo costume!

08:25.520 --> 08:28.840
-And it's just your size!
-Of course it is.

08:36.199 --> 08:37.439
Hmm?

08:38.880 --> 08:40.400
There's the Mighty Tah-Shue!

08:41.159 --> 08:42.679
[Ollie]
And there are my chopsticks

08:42.799 --> 08:45.240
and my last chance to get them back!

08:45.360 --> 08:47.120
Oops! Whoa! Ugh!

08:48.120 --> 08:49.640
[they shout]

08:52.880 --> 08:55.319
-Go, Ollie!
-What?

08:55.920 --> 08:59.560
Moon, help! Wrestling
was not part of the plan!

08:59.720 --> 09:00.959
Uh, don't worry.

09:01.079 --> 09:04.640
I'll get yet another brainstorm
any second now!

09:04.800 --> 09:06.680
Oh, come on, brain!

09:07.360 --> 09:09.319
[gong]

09:12.959 --> 09:15.959
-How about now, Moon?
-Oh, this is so hard!

09:16.120 --> 09:18.600
What if an idea doesn't
pop into my head in time?

09:19.040 --> 09:21.760
Pop? Of course! That's OK, Moon!

09:21.920 --> 09:23.800
Because <i>I'm </i>having a brainstorm!

09:24.079 --> 09:26.439
-You are?
-Hop on! It'll be easy.

09:26.920 --> 09:30.000
Easy for you, maybe. But I'll try.

09:37.040 --> 09:39.400
Try again! This time I'll help!

09:40.959 --> 09:42.600
Thanks, Hiroki! Now what?

09:42.760 --> 09:44.360
Just grab the chopsticks.

09:44.520 --> 09:46.120
-Wow!
-Yeah!

You made that seem so easy, Ollie!

10:24.920 --> 10:27.439
It was easy, somehow!

10:27.600 --> 10:30.640
Though there's one hard thing
I could use your help with.

10:30.800 --> 10:34.439
Getting me outta this thing! Come on!

10:34.640 --> 10:36.040
Here, come here, buddy!

using only my nose!

10:42.520 --> 10:45.520
Wow, Auntie Chartreux,
what an amazing story!

10:45.680 --> 10:49.360
Your turn, Ollie.
Tell me a story of adventure,

10:49.520 --> 10:51.079
daring, courage!

10:52.760 --> 10:55.040
You know what? I think I can.

10:55.839 --> 10:59.480
It all started when I went
to a place called Japan...
