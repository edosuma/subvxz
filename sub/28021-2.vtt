WEBVTT

00:00.260 --> 00:02.663
I want to talk about
someone, a girl, clever

00:02.663 --> 00:04.967
If she's still interested
in adrenalizing work.

00:05.000 --> 00:07.575
That fight's over.
She talk Russian?

00:07.600 --> 00:08.888
Would you have any
moral compunction

00:08.988 --> 00:10.175
if you were to be serving

00:10.400 --> 00:12.215
under a socialist government?

00:12.240 --> 00:14.415
Russia's why Attlee won the election.

00:14.440 --> 00:17.175
We believe Whitehall has
been infiltrated by Communists.

00:17.200 --> 00:20.295
That's why I need an
agent in the civil service.

00:20.320 --> 00:22.375
I want my life to matter.

00:22.400 --> 00:24.135
That politician you were
dancing with, a friend?

00:24.160 --> 00:25.335
Not really.

00:25.360 --> 00:26.615
Make him one.

00:26.640 --> 00:28.975
Whatever you're
working on is to be aborted.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.295
The skeletal crew will
remain in the UK.

00:31.320 --> 00:32.655
Let me run her.

00:32.680 --> 00:37.175
What I am going to do is
call Feef and tell her it's off.

00:37.200 --> 00:40.455
I need you to find a way to move
to the Cabinet Office. - Why?

00:40.480 --> 00:42.495
It's the heart of government.

00:42.520 --> 00:44.935
Don't you want to be
at the centre of it all?

01:02.920 --> 01:04.375
Who are we killing for?

01:06.560 --> 01:08.015
Who are we dying for?

01:09.600 --> 01:11.975
The world as it was?

01:12.000 --> 01:14.415
Or the world as it ought to be?

01:15.640 --> 01:17.255
Listen to this. It's so simple

01:17.280 --> 01:19.215
it's a bloody joke.

01:19.240 --> 01:21.727
The object of government, in peace

01:21.727 --> 01:24.215
and war, is not glory for rulers

01:24.240 --> 01:29.615
or races, but happiness
of the common man.

01:29.640 --> 01:30.935
The common man.

01:32.880 --> 01:34.415
That's us.

01:35.400 --> 01:36.695
Let's fight for us.

01:38.920 --> 01:41.615
Churchill has banned that
report from the troops, hasn't he?

01:41.640 --> 01:43.215
Fuck Churchill.

01:46.360 --> 01:47.775
Read it.

01:47.800 --> 01:49.335
Let's slay the giants.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.535
Before I got here,

02:27.560 --> 02:29.855
I just didn't realise
the world was so big.

02:31.960 --> 02:37.575
I thought it was all village fetes
and marrying the girl next door.

02:42.480 --> 02:45.095
I'm happy about that bit,
of course.

02:52.360 --> 02:56.935
Men can accomplish so much,
that's the thing to remember.

03:03.480 --> 03:05.175
Are you going to stand, then?

03:09.880 --> 03:11.215

Mr Fenton, I don't believe
we've met.

04:44.600 --> 04:47.815
Marcus Wynn, I'm your whip.

04:47.840 --> 04:50.615
Message for you from the
Prime Minister.

04:50.640 --> 04:53.007
In the matter of
the American loans,

04:53.007 --> 04:55.375
you are to vote that
we accept the terms.

04:55.400 --> 04:57.015
The terms are outrageous.

04:57.040 --> 04:59.735
Your maiden speech was
a triumph, Mr Fenton.

04:59.760 --> 05:02.495
The best of the Beveridge
report but rousingly delivered.

05:02.520 --> 05:04.495
Education, housing,
health care for all.

05:04.520 --> 05:06.895
Now, if you would like Mr
Attlee to pass a single piece

05:06.920 --> 05:09.575
of our ambitious and
transformative legislative agenda

05:09.600 --> 05:11.855
then we must take America's
money and the terms she has set.

05:11.880 --> 05:14.855
Otherwise, the legacy of this
administration will be half

05:14.880 --> 05:17.255
starving the citizenry to
death and...

05:19.000 --> 05:21.255
No, that's it, half starving
the citizenry to death.

05:21.280 --> 05:23.095
Beggars can't be choosers.

05:23.120 --> 05:24.815
We are not beggars.
- Oh, but we are.

05:24.840 --> 05:27.055
In faded suits with frayed
cuffs on bended knee.

05:27.240 --> 05:29.735
And pretending otherwise will
not make it so. The Americans...

05:29.760 --> 05:33.455
In your opinion, should we
build this welfare state?

05:33.480 --> 05:35.615
Then we need money.

05:35.640 --> 05:38.095
And, in my opinion, passionate
backbenchers seeking to effect

05:38.120 --> 05:40.375
change should not draw
negative attention to themselves,

05:40.400 --> 05:43.815
especially when they're
currently held in high esteem.

05:43.840 --> 05:47.095
The day liked your speech
very much.

05:47.120 --> 05:48.735
You have his attention.

05:50.080 --> 05:51.175
Capitalise.

05:54.320 --> 05:57.495
Don't tell me, do what he says
and it's a Cabinet position?

05:57.520 --> 05:58.935
Did he talk to you?

05:58.960 --> 06:02.175
We told him fuck the Americans
and fuck their fucking loans.

06:02.200 --> 06:04.695
Did he say anything about
your speech?

06:04.720 --> 06:06.775
He said the PM hated mine.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.935
He didn't mention it.

06:11.160 --> 06:13.455
This loan, with the interest
rates offered,

06:13.480 --> 06:15.095
may ameliorate our financial
crisis

06:15.120 --> 06:17.975
in the short-term, but in
the long-term,

06:18.000 --> 06:21.295
and I'm talking about from
now until the year 2000,

06:21.320 --> 06:24.815
we will be on the rack to the
United States government,

06:24.840 --> 06:27.615
in hock to them to the
tune of £70 million a year?

06:27.640 --> 06:29.295
Order!

06:29.320 --> 06:31.127
How are we to retain an
independent outlook

06:31.127 --> 06:32.935
from a debtors' jail?

06:32.960 --> 06:35.175
Hear, hear.

06:48.880 --> 06:50.375
Hello.

06:50.400 --> 06:52.015
Where's Peter?

06:52.040 --> 06:53.888
He'll be back soon.

06:53.888 --> 06:55.735
Sorry, you're stuck
with the ugly one.

06:55.760 --> 06:57.215
Where did he go?

06:57.240 --> 06:59.495
I can't tell you, sorry.

06:59.520 --> 07:01.495
I just... I thought he
would be running me.

07:01.520 --> 07:02.775
No, that's my job.

07:02.800 --> 07:06.055
Peter's needed elsewhere
right now.

07:06.080 --> 07:07.895
If it really bothers you,

07:07.920 --> 07:09.095
talk to him about it later.

07:15.400 --> 07:17.455
When can you move to the
Cabinet Office?

07:17.480 --> 07:19.535
The whole place is
structure and rules.

07:19.560 --> 07:21.455
I mustn't rush it.
It would look odd.

07:21.480 --> 07:23.255
No-one thinks you're an agent.

07:23.280 --> 07:25.688
They think you're a
rebellious spirit

07:25.688 --> 07:28.095
having a little adventure

07:28.120 --> 07:31.015
in Whitehall before you go
and get married.

07:31.040 --> 07:33.375
But you are an agent
and you have a mission.

07:33.400 --> 07:34.935
Be creative.

07:37.400 --> 07:38.575
All right.

07:38.600 --> 07:40.295
What's in the Cabinet Office?

07:40.320 --> 07:41.535
A Russian spy.

07:42.720 --> 07:45.095
Actually in the Cabinet Office?

07:45.120 --> 07:47.015
Yes.

07:47.040 --> 07:49.248
France is falling
to the communists,

07:49.248 --> 07:51.455
so is East Germany,
Poland, Romania

07:51.480 --> 07:53.768
and this tidal wave of
interest in communism

07:53.768 --> 07:56.055
doesn't just happen.

07:57.280 --> 08:01.015
It's the result of the Russian
genius for placing spies,

08:01.040 --> 08:04.375
agitators, infiltrators everywhere.

08:04.400 --> 08:07.175
Including the British Empire,
including your socialist government,

08:07.200 --> 08:09.375
including your Cabinet Office

08:09.400 --> 08:11.895
where all the Prime Minister's
secrets, domestic, foreign,

08:11.920 --> 08:13.775
nuclear, are kept.

08:13.800 --> 08:16.175
How do you know they've
got someone in there?

08:16.200 --> 08:17.735
You had a predecessor.

08:19.520 --> 08:21.055
Who was that?

08:21.080 --> 08:22.415
What happened to him?

08:22.440 --> 08:24.455
Get in first and
I'll tell you.

08:45.320 --> 08:46.895
How you doing?

08:46.920 --> 08:48.375
Yeah, good.

09:01.720 --> 09:02.695
Do you want to sit down?

09:07.920 --> 09:09.135
I've got a question.

09:10.360 --> 09:12.175
Why did you join the army?

09:16.960 --> 09:18.227
There was a general feeling,

09:18.227 --> 09:19.495
among a lot of people
I know...

09:21.440 --> 09:23.168
...that if we acquit
ourselves well

09:23.168 --> 09:24.895
in the military it
might have some

09:24.920 --> 09:26.895
bearing on our situation
back home.

09:28.800 --> 09:30.415
Ah.

09:30.440 --> 09:32.375
And you think it will?

09:32.400 --> 09:33.895
From what I'm hearing, no.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.295
Men kill, don't they?

09:39.800 --> 09:41.668
Sometimes because they're heroes

09:41.668 --> 09:43.535
and the other guys are Nazis.

09:43.560 --> 09:46.255
Sometimes because they're
an asshole

09:46.280 --> 09:49.335
and they want to string
a fella from a tree.

09:52.520 --> 09:54.175
I killed someone.

09:55.760 --> 09:58.375
I could tell you
why I did it.

09:58.400 --> 10:01.215
If you want to know,
I will.

10:01.240 --> 10:02.888
But I'm a white guy,
you're a Negro,

10:02.888 --> 10:04.535
so why the fuck would
you believe

10:04.560 --> 10:06.375
a word that comes out
of my mouth?

10:06.400 --> 10:09.015
So, let's stick to the
verifiable facts.

10:10.600 --> 10:13.255
There's a dead man in
my apartment...

10:13.280 --> 10:17.135
...and I need you to help me
get rid of him.

10:17.160 --> 10:19.695
If you help me,
I will give you money.

10:21.600 --> 10:23.095
What's the harm?

12:09.880 --> 12:13.015
Now, I'd like you to take
another crack at this.

12:13.040 --> 12:15.695
Not bad, definitely a
first draft.

12:15.720 --> 12:17.735
My biggest concern is that
you recommend pinewood

12:17.760 --> 12:19.535
as an ideal building material.
- Which it is.

12:19.560 --> 12:21.047
That you affirm, but
the conclusion

12:21.047 --> 12:22.535
has a certain spontaneity

12:22.560 --> 12:25.295
that's tonally wrong as
you barely reference spruce.

12:25.320 --> 12:29.095
Ash, we have access to
cypress in the colonies.

12:29.120 --> 12:30.695
I'm so sorry.

12:30.720 --> 12:33.895
Don't be sorry, first
draft of first report ever.

12:42.920 --> 12:44.855
Where the hell do you
think you are going, miss?

12:44.880 --> 12:46.215
The Cabinet Office.

12:46.240 --> 12:47.335
You'll sign in.

12:51.360 --> 12:53.767
I am not married and nor do I

12:53.767 --> 12:56.175
expect to marry in the near future,

12:56.200 --> 12:57.788
therefore I did not organise
this meeting

12:57.788 --> 12:59.375
out of personal interest,

12:59.400 --> 13:00.855
Mr Quick.

13:00.880 --> 13:03.615
Well, I'm here out of
bloody personal interest.

13:03.640 --> 13:05.735
Fire me just because my
husband's coming home?

13:05.760 --> 13:07.888
Is the Cabinet Office
entirely

13:07.888 --> 13:10.015
the appropriate venue
for this sort

13:10.040 --> 13:11.615
of discussion, Mr Quick?

13:11.640 --> 13:14.695
Yes, it is, Mr Stevens,
as I arranged it.

13:14.720 --> 13:16.895
Thank you for your contribution.

13:19.720 --> 13:22.987
Gentleman, the spirit of the times
dictates

13:22.987 --> 13:26.255
rebuild, rebuild, rebuild.

13:27.880 --> 13:30.575
Let women rebuild, too.

13:33.720 --> 13:37.775
Rebuild is a word,
another word is rebirth.

13:37.800 --> 13:42.215
Now, we lifted the ban on married
women working during the war

13:42.240 --> 13:44.935
but now your men are coming home.

13:44.960 --> 13:49.775
They have sacrificed, as well you
know, more than you in this war

13:49.800 --> 13:52.575
and they will need and
have earned your attention.

13:54.400 --> 13:58.735
We have lost a terrible
number of our children.

13:58.760 --> 14:01.695
Mr Quick, women are
more than just breeders.

14:12.960 --> 14:15.135
Listen to me.

14:15.160 --> 14:18.375
Married women working here
would be a perfect nuisance.

14:18.400 --> 14:21.455
They would need to leave to
put their husband's supper on.

14:21.480 --> 14:24.055
They would be concerned
about sick children.

14:24.080 --> 14:26.268
They will cry every day

14:26.268 --> 14:28.455
and you will be as
annoyed as anyone else.

14:28.480 --> 14:32.455
There is irresolvable tension
between a woman working

14:32.480 --> 14:35.015
and her domestic responsibilities

14:35.040 --> 14:36.975
and I just don't have
the time for this.

14:42.800 --> 14:44.935
This all that's left of you?

14:44.960 --> 14:46.735
Everyone else went home? Yes.

14:57.080 --> 14:58.735
I thought Peter was staying?

14:58.760 --> 15:00.015
We had squash scheduled.

15:00.040 --> 15:01.615
I'll remind him for you.

15:01.640 --> 15:03.855
It seems rather pointless
any of you being here

15:03.880 --> 15:06.495
if all you're allowed to do is
read our intelligence reports.

15:06.520 --> 15:09.055
Whoa, a Russian gave
up 39 names?

15:09.080 --> 15:10.535
Who did?

15:10.560 --> 15:12.255
A Russian that defected,
Kechenko.

15:12.280 --> 15:16.175
He gave up 39 names?

15:16.200 --> 15:20.095
So, that's 40 Russian
operatives stealing secrets,

15:20.120 --> 15:22.975
atomic and otherwise,
and threatening all of us?

15:23.000 --> 15:24.815
Man, how compromised
are you guys?

15:24.840 --> 15:26.775
I don't take your meaning.

15:26.800 --> 15:29.067
Fucking Soviet spy
ring in Canada

15:29.067 --> 15:31.335
you guys found about how?

15:31.360 --> 15:33.375
Because one of them
fucking told you?

15:33.400 --> 15:36.055
Do you think I give a shit
about your intelligence report?

15:38.000 --> 15:39.628
Man, you guys don't have
a clue what's happening

15:39.628 --> 15:41.255
unless a Russian

15:41.280 --> 15:43.535
comes knocking on your
front door to tattletale.

15:43.560 --> 15:44.935
The Canadians...

15:44.960 --> 15:46.895
Part of your Commonwealth, right?

15:46.920 --> 15:49.015
Your king owns it.

15:49.040 --> 15:51.055
Take responsibility for it.

15:58.480 --> 15:58.575
I heard you came to London because
you went off your head, rather.

15:58.800 --> 16:00.847
Had some tough times
in the war,

16:00.847 --> 16:02.895
made rather significant errors

16:08.400 --> 16:08.535
in Bucharest, lost a lot of men

16:08.560 --> 16:10.695
which, understandably, broke you.

16:15.320 --> 16:17.695
No wonder you were put
out to pasture here in London

16:17.720 --> 16:20.215
at this rather pointless desk job.

16:21.760 --> 16:25.695
Talk to me like that again
and I'll have you sent home.

16:25.720 --> 16:27.455
One way or another.

16:43.760 --> 16:45.255
Where the hell is Peter?

16:48.560 --> 16:50.495
Bored out of his mind.

16:52.040 --> 16:55.815
He told me he is drafting
a letter of resignation.

16:55.840 --> 16:58.335
Guess who's stuck
with the paperwork?

17:16.440 --> 17:18.895
You're not supposed to be here.

17:18.920 --> 17:20.855
Why are you packing up
Peter's room?

17:20.880 --> 17:22.255
Where is he?

17:22.280 --> 17:23.935
He needs these things
sent on to him.

17:23.960 --> 17:26.055
Where? I can't say.

17:26.079 --> 17:28.454
Oh, come on, Jackson,
I'm not going to...

17:28.480 --> 17:30.095
Where?

17:30.120 --> 17:32.855
Just tell me so I can
say goodbye to him.

17:34.440 --> 17:36.855
Let me tell you about
these people.

17:36.880 --> 17:39.335
You can only push them
so far with your questions

17:39.360 --> 17:40.707
and breaking the rules

17:40.707 --> 17:42.055
and showing up where
you're not supposed to.

17:42.080 --> 17:44.575
No-one told me I couldn't
come to his hotel room.

17:48.040 --> 17:49.295
OK.

17:51.880 --> 17:54.015
You want something of his?

17:54.040 --> 17:55.935
He'll be fine with it, I bet.

18:09.560 --> 18:10.935
Thank you.

18:21.120 --> 18:23.615
Don't tell Rowe I came here.

18:35.720 --> 18:39.535
Dear Feef, you're not supposed to
know where I am or what I'm doing

18:39.560 --> 18:41.815
so when you're done reading,
burn this.

18:43.040 --> 18:45.895
I'm headed to Poland and,
because it's dangerous,

18:45.920 --> 18:49.535
I'm saying goodbye even
though it busts all protocol.

18:49.560 --> 18:51.895
Like you, I will be undercover.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.775
Communication will be hard.

18:55.800 --> 18:55.935
I will take strength in
knowing that

18:55.960 --> 18:57.347
I will take strength in knowing

18:57.347 --> 18:58.735
that we're fighting the same fight

18:58.760 --> 19:00.695
in the same way.

19:00.720 --> 19:02.975
Courage! You've got bags of it.

19:05.760 --> 19:07.055
Bug?

19:12.160 --> 19:13.135
OK.

19:15.240 --> 19:16.895
Bug...

19:18.120 --> 19:19.775
...over and out.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.815
Mr Hennessy has been...

19:38.560 --> 19:41.335
His advances are very strong.

19:43.560 --> 19:46.775
I understand that boys
will be boys.

19:46.800 --> 19:49.495
Honestly, I was going to
have to hand in my notice

19:49.520 --> 19:52.215
because I can't have
him grabbing...

19:52.240 --> 19:55.375
just slap at him.

19:55.400 --> 19:58.415
If he grabs at you again
just slap at him.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.415
But then I thought of you.

20:05.680 --> 20:07.975
Pull yourself together, dear.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.855
Tears are so weak.

20:12.720 --> 20:15.655
I'm sorry, but I can't just
take you in.

20:15.680 --> 20:18.335
The Cabinet Office is an
elite placement.

20:18.360 --> 20:19.615
We see everything.

20:19.640 --> 20:23.775
We prepare everything for the
Prime Minister and his Cabinet.

20:24.160 --> 20:26.655
We are not a port in a storm.

20:26.680 --> 20:28.655
I also believe that I could
do the work.

20:28.680 --> 20:31.095
Yes, well, unfortunately,
after your interview in June,

20:31.120 --> 20:32.855
I told the others I thought
you could not.

20:32.880 --> 20:34.455
That was my judgment.

20:35.640 --> 20:39.615
And as you are well aware,
things are harder for women,

20:39.640 --> 20:41.575
I cannot appear not to know
my own mind.

20:41.600 --> 20:42.815
Why did you...?

20:42.840 --> 20:44.535
It's not a matter of ability.

20:44.560 --> 20:46.895
It's a matter of character.

20:46.920 --> 20:52.095
This job requires the sort of people
who are happiest in a backroom,

20:52.120 --> 20:54.575
working out the sort of
problem most people would find

20:54.600 --> 20:56.215
too grey and tedious to consider.

20:56.240 --> 21:00.695
Now, you are a front room
sort of person.

21:03.240 --> 21:07.415
Well, just so you know,

21:07.440 --> 21:09.975
I am fascinated by the tedious.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.135
Psst!

22:14.280 --> 22:16.015
I just got a call from Miss Garrick.

22:16.040 --> 22:18.375
She wants you in the Cabinet Office.

22:18.400 --> 22:20.695
Which is annoying, seeing as
I'm the one who fought to hire

22:20.720 --> 22:22.975
you in the first place.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.455
She's short-staffed, apparently.

22:24.480 --> 22:25.775
Really?

22:25.800 --> 22:28.615
Too bad for her, I don't have to
sign you off and I'd rather not.

22:38.600 --> 22:40.015
I wish you would.

22:41.880 --> 22:43.175
Why?

22:43.200 --> 22:45.655
Right now you're building
homes for those who have none.

22:45.680 --> 22:47.535
What could possibly be
more important than that?

22:47.560 --> 22:49.375
I just find it all very dull.

22:58.840 --> 23:00.175
I knew you could do it!

23:00.200 --> 23:01.495
I knew it!

23:01.520 --> 23:03.055
Now what?

23:03.080 --> 23:06.335
Now it gets a little simpler,
believe it or not.

23:09.360 --> 23:11.027
We know the Russians accessed
information

23:11.027 --> 23:12.695
shared at two private

23:12.720 --> 23:15.688
Cabinet Office meetings, one in
'37, one in '43,

23:15.688 --> 23:18.655
because otherwise

23:18.680 --> 23:22.335
how in the hell does a random
Russian diplomat know Attlee said

23:22.360 --> 23:25.375
the UK should give up their
bases in the Middle East?

23:25.400 --> 23:27.695
How in the hell does a
Russian diplomat know

23:27.720 --> 23:29.088
Churchill tasked his
generals with drawing up

23:29.088 --> 23:30.455
battle plans for a
ground invasion

23:30.480 --> 23:31.695
into Moscow?

23:31.720 --> 23:32.847
So, it's someone from
The Cabinet Office

23:32.847 --> 23:33.975
who was at both

23:34.000 --> 23:35.335
of those meetings?

23:35.360 --> 23:36.575
Correct.

23:37.520 --> 23:38.935
Tearoom.

23:42.560 --> 23:43.655
typing pool.

23:45.920 --> 23:47.975
But I have no reason
to go to the archives.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.655
Isn't that suspicious?

23:49.680 --> 23:53.295
I mean, we don't want
people thinking I'm a spy.

23:54.640 --> 23:56.455
Your desk.

23:56.480 --> 23:58.095
You're upper class.

23:58.120 --> 24:00.575
Every gesture you make
screams entitlement.

24:00.600 --> 24:02.815
That's why you're perfect,
no-one will question you.

24:02.840 --> 24:04.527
Archives? There's no
reason on Earth

24:04.527 --> 24:06.215
you'll need anything
from the archives.

24:06.240 --> 24:08.375
Really? I had to use the
housing archives all the time.

24:08.400 --> 24:10.415
We have over 500 meetings
a day here.

24:10.440 --> 24:12.615
You'll mostly attend
and take notes.

24:13.840 --> 24:16.695
Nice to meet you. Jerry
Roxborough. - Feef.

24:16.720 --> 24:18.495
Symonds, yes. I heard.

24:18.520 --> 24:21.375
I do hope Mr Mulligan's
tour has been thorough. Mm.

24:21.400 --> 24:24.455
I'll be happy to answer any
questions you have, also.

24:27.040 --> 24:28.215
Great.

24:53.840 --> 24:55.855
Is the girl in yet?

24:55.880 --> 24:57.415
Of course she's in.

24:57.560 --> 24:59.215
What did I tell you?

24:59.240 --> 25:00.575
OK, great.

25:00.600 --> 25:03.148
Now, listen, the money men
I told you about,

25:03.148 --> 25:05.695
they're getting nervous

25:05.720 --> 25:07.815
the loans vote won't go through.

25:08.080 --> 25:10.415
Obviously we're doing what
we can via the embassy

25:10.440 --> 25:13.175
but diplomats can only
do so much.

25:16.120 --> 25:19.095
So, they want me
to do something?

25:19.120 --> 25:21.295
If you can.

25:21.320 --> 25:23.255
Meaning I'm working for
these guys?

25:23.280 --> 25:24.895
Doing them a favour.

25:24.920 --> 25:26.535
Well, tell them I
need a budget.

25:26.680 --> 25:27.535
A real budget.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.495
These guys have more
power than God.

25:31.520 --> 25:33.695
I don't like telling
them things.

25:33.720 --> 25:35.528
They're lobbying Truman,

25:35.528 --> 25:37.335
they want a real American
intelligence agency

25:37.360 --> 25:39.815
up and running, they're
going to need proof

25:39.840 --> 25:42.015
of what real American
intelligence agents can do.

25:42.040 --> 25:45.255
Now, I'm damn good at my job,
my real job, not paper pushing,

25:45.280 --> 25:48.335
but I can't get shit
done without money.

25:48.360 --> 25:51.655
If I get you money,
there have to be results.

25:51.680 --> 25:53.095
Why wouldn't there be?

25:54.480 --> 25:56.295
I heard Peter resigned.

25:58.040 --> 26:00.295
So, he doesn't have much
faith in you.

26:00.320 --> 26:03.255
Look, you read my
report, if you want results,

26:03.280 --> 26:04.935
I need a budget.

26:04.960 --> 26:08.655
Then the money men need
the loans vote pushed through.

26:10.520 --> 26:13.895
Just put the girl to work.

26:22.200 --> 26:24.135
The politician you were
dancing with,

26:24.160 --> 26:25.775
I need you to tell me
about his friends.

26:25.920 --> 26:27.375
We're barely acquainted.

26:29.320 --> 26:30.615
Change that.

26:31.760 --> 26:33.655
I need to know who in
the Labour Party is voting

26:33.680 --> 26:35.975
against the American loans.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.855
How does that relate
to the Cabinet Office?

26:37.880 --> 26:39.975
Peter told me you were trained.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.815
So, I assumed you learned
that an agent does not get filled

26:42.840 --> 26:45.255
in on the big picture, an
agent does what they're told

26:45.280 --> 26:48.135
when they are told it and
does not ask questions.

26:48.160 --> 26:50.015
Yes.

26:50.040 --> 26:51.255
This is the job.

26:53.280 --> 26:55.415
Did anybody ever give you
the impression this was easy?

26:56.920 --> 27:00.535
I was given the impression
the job was about Russia.

27:00.560 --> 27:04.855
The far left of the Labour
Party are robotic ideologues

27:04.880 --> 27:06.928
and they're taking orders
from Moscow,

27:06.928 --> 27:08.975
whether they know it or not.

27:26.960 --> 27:28.775
I can't come, I'm sorry.

27:28.800 --> 27:30.455
No. What? I have to work.

27:30.480 --> 27:31.535
No, you have to!

27:31.560 --> 27:33.855
It's supposed to be the
great meeting of the families.

27:33.880 --> 27:35.368
They've been travelling
for literally weeks

27:35.368 --> 27:36.855
to get to England
from Ceylon!

27:36.880 --> 27:38.468
They're going to want
to meet my sister.

27:38.468 --> 27:40.055
And I'll see them next
weekend at the wedding!

27:40.080 --> 27:42.695
Am I supposed to say
you have to work?

27:42.720 --> 27:44.575
They're going to think
you're so mannish!

27:44.600 --> 27:46.815
Fine! Fine.

27:57.560 --> 28:00.255
Are you sure you want
to get married?

28:01.760 --> 28:04.175
Men don't have to,
you know.

28:04.200 --> 28:06.895
You were supposed to bloody
marry so we could get some money

28:06.920 --> 28:09.095
and do up the house
and help Ma and Pa

28:09.120 --> 28:11.775
and you didn't, so now I have
to do it, I have to be the girl.

28:15.480 --> 28:17.135
It's disgusting.

28:30.360 --> 28:31.375
Feef!

28:34.960 --> 28:36.975
Yeah, come over.

28:38.760 --> 28:38.895
Do you really think
the Americans

28:38.920 --> 28:42.215
Do you really think the
Americans are as bad as all that?

28:42.240 --> 28:46.775
The Americans are fine, America
is shit, excuse my language.

28:48.040 --> 28:50.415
But you're not a communist?

28:50.440 --> 28:52.775
A little too extreme for me,
but who knows?

28:52.800 --> 28:54.815
Never say never.

28:54.840 --> 28:57.135
This time five years ago
I was a Tory, so...

28:57.160 --> 28:58.575
Really? Why?

28:58.600 --> 29:00.455
What changed?
- The war.

29:00.480 --> 29:02.327
The first time I ever
went abroad,

29:02.327 --> 29:04.175
the first time I met people

29:04.200 --> 29:07.335
with different backgrounds
to me, different ideas.

29:07.360 --> 29:09.215
We're all so hemmed in,
aren't we?

29:09.240 --> 29:10.855
Unless we fight to get out.

29:10.880 --> 29:13.015
You don't seem
hemmed in to me.

29:13.040 --> 29:14.495
Really? No.

29:28.440 --> 29:29.695
Is he going to kiss her?

29:29.720 --> 29:30.695
Oh...

29:34.320 --> 29:36.295
Hasn't got the balls.

29:36.320 --> 29:37.575
He's got a fiance.

29:38.960 --> 29:40.175
I looked into it.

29:49.960 --> 29:55.415
What are they like, these
young braves, Stewart Butler?

29:57.200 --> 30:00.415
These men, they're rejecting
America's offer of help, why?

30:00.440 --> 30:01.747
Because they think it's an
aggressive gesture

30:01.747 --> 30:03.055
designed to make England

30:03.080 --> 30:06.655
financially beholden to the
United States and whatever

30:06.680 --> 30:09.135
her agenda may be.

30:09.160 --> 30:10.888
I don't play politics
but I do know that

30:10.888 --> 30:12.615
over in America we are fans

30:12.640 --> 30:15.488
of democracy and
we do sometimes

30:15.488 --> 30:18.335
offer financial aid,
with the proviso

30:18.360 --> 30:22.695
that the recipient allow the
good people of Africa and India

30:22.720 --> 30:25.975
and Ceylon and so on
to elect their own rulers.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.535
Perhaps you're not a
fan of the British Empire

30:28.560 --> 30:30.935
because it makes us a
force to be reckoned with?

30:32.800 --> 30:35.655
We were talking about
Stewart Butler.

30:35.680 --> 30:37.215
He's patronising.

30:37.360 --> 30:38.615
Uh-huh?

30:38.640 --> 30:40.815
Why did you invite a Tory
to drink with us?

30:40.840 --> 30:42.615
Tories sit on that side.

30:42.640 --> 30:44.855
Tight-fisted, too,
he never bought a round.

30:44.880 --> 30:46.095
Really?

30:46.120 --> 30:47.895
How did he explain that?

30:47.920 --> 30:48.775
Your round.

30:50.040 --> 30:51.495
I'm out, sorry.

30:51.520 --> 30:53.415
Is it ever your round,
Stu Ball?

30:53.440 --> 30:56.535
Hugh Fenton, your boyfriend.

30:56.560 --> 30:58.815
Neither my boyfriend
nor a communist.

30:58.840 --> 31:00.535
What else about Mr Fenton?

31:02.720 --> 31:04.575
Hugh used to be a Tory.

31:04.600 --> 31:05.907
Shame on Attlee and
shame on Wynn

31:05.907 --> 31:07.215
for trying to get us to abandon

31:07.240 --> 31:09.455
the socialist principles that
got us elected.

31:09.480 --> 31:10.935
Shame!

31:15.080 --> 31:17.415
I know it can feel
uncomfortable

31:17.440 --> 31:20.175
telling tales after you've
broken bread,

31:20.200 --> 31:22.655
but it's part of the job.

31:28.440 --> 31:30.108
How are you progressing
with gaining access

31:30.108 --> 31:31.775
to the Cabinet archives?

31:31.800 --> 31:33.655
I'm working on it.

31:33.680 --> 31:35.455
Good.

31:34.780 --> 31:36.955
And you remember the
dates I told you?

31:38.100 --> 31:39.555
Hello.

31:39.580 --> 31:40.868
Could you pull
the minutes

31:40.868 --> 31:42.155
from the post-war
planning committee

31:42.180 --> 31:45.075
meeting of February
7th, 1943?

31:45.100 --> 31:46.948
And the minutes from
the May 22nd, 1937

31:46.948 --> 31:48.595
Palestine Working Group?

31:50.380 --> 31:51.995
Name?
- Fiona Symonds.

31:53.340 --> 31:55.755
Just don't leave
a paper trail.

31:55.780 --> 31:57.195
What if I do?

31:57.220 --> 31:58.555
Just don't.

32:09.980 --> 32:11.395
What was your name again?

32:11.420 --> 32:12.995
Fiona Symonds.

32:18.980 --> 32:20.355
Can I keep these overnight?

32:21.380 --> 32:22.755
Back by six.

33:39.840 --> 33:41.375
In a line, chaps.

33:42.560 --> 33:43.735
Ayes over here.

33:43.760 --> 33:45.415
Where are you going?

33:45.440 --> 33:46.935
We're voting no.

33:46.960 --> 33:49.495
They're changing their votes,
look at them.

33:49.520 --> 33:50.928
When I went home
this weekend

33:50.928 --> 33:52.335
the union said they
won't support me

33:52.360 --> 33:54.615
next time around unless
I vote yes to the loan.

33:54.640 --> 33:56.188
They think we
won't be able to

33:56.188 --> 33:57.735
keep the docks open
without it, so...

33:57.760 --> 33:59.255
I'm with Will, actually.

33:59.280 --> 34:00.655
I'm actually a socialist.

34:00.680 --> 34:01.775
Aren't you?

34:01.800 --> 34:03.375
How quickly they fall.

34:04.880 --> 34:06.375
No.

34:06.400 --> 34:08.534
No fucking way.

34:08.560 --> 34:11.295
What will I get now,
the cane?

34:11.600 --> 34:13.688
If you wish to
confront America,

34:13.688 --> 34:15.775
I've got just
the job for you.

34:16.960 --> 34:18.855
Stewart Butler, gambler.

34:19.920 --> 34:22.175
I flipped his vote.

34:22.199 --> 34:24.295
The girl figured out he
was short on cash,

34:24.320 --> 34:26.495
I found out why,
and now he's ours.

34:28.280 --> 34:32.534
The girl, she is on the trail
and she's planning to take

34:32.560 --> 34:34.815
the politician home
for the weekend.

34:34.840 --> 34:37.014
Pass that on too.

34:37.040 --> 34:38.335
He'll be pleased.

34:38.360 --> 34:41.415
Also tell them I radioed a few
of the OSS guys in Europe,

34:41.440 --> 34:43.455
a bunch of them will stay put.

34:43.480 --> 34:44.815
OK.

34:44.840 --> 34:47.054
We need them there.

34:47.080 --> 34:49.135
Get me their names and
a way to contact them.

34:49.159 --> 34:51.495
Get us a budget.

34:51.520 --> 34:53.495
Look...

34:53.520 --> 34:54.855
Nice shot.

34:57.360 --> 34:59.775
Where did you come
in that race?

34:59.800 --> 35:02.215
Oh...

35:04.240 --> 35:05.648
If you didn't
win, man,

35:05.648 --> 35:07.055
what the fuck is it
doing on the wall?

35:09.800 --> 35:11.135
Call Daddy.

35:20.800 --> 35:22.615
There should be three.

35:22.640 --> 35:24.015
No, there are
definitely four.

35:24.040 --> 35:26.015
Miss Symonds works on
this floor, doesn't she?

35:26.040 --> 35:28.975
Yes, and I'd like to know
where the hell she is.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.948
Why not colloquy with
the secretaries

35:30.948 --> 35:32.895
after work, Mr Fenton?

35:32.920 --> 35:34.255
Hello.

35:34.280 --> 35:36.855
Hello. I have to go.

35:36.880 --> 35:37.927
My whip's punishing me

35:37.927 --> 35:38.975
for voting against
the loans.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.855
Is he punishing your
friends, too?

35:40.880 --> 35:42.455
No need. They caved.

35:42.480 --> 35:44.055
Fenton. Now.

35:52.600 --> 35:54.935
I don't suppose you're
free this weekend, are you?

35:54.960 --> 35:56.575
I am. I am.

35:56.600 --> 35:57.695
Mr Fenton.

35:57.720 --> 35:59.535
It's my brother's
wedding reception.

35:59.560 --> 36:00.855
I'll telephone you.

36:14.320 --> 36:15.887
Mr Stephens, I heard
you were working

36:15.887 --> 36:17.455
on the New Towns Act,

36:17.480 --> 36:18.908
I did a fair amount
of work on wood

36:18.908 --> 36:20.335
when I was in housing,

36:20.360 --> 36:22.975
so just in case you were
looking for any intel?

36:23.000 --> 36:24.575
I'm sorry, you are...?

36:24.600 --> 36:26.495
Fee? Symonds.

36:28.240 --> 36:29.495
Hello, again.

36:30.640 --> 36:32.575
Apparently you've met
Mr Roxborough.

36:34.200 --> 36:38.295
My father wanted me to
say hello to a Mr Jarvis.

36:38.320 --> 36:40.255
I don't suppose you know
where I could find him?

36:41.680 --> 36:43.608
I heard he was working
here before me,

36:43.608 --> 36:45.535
my predecessor in a way?

36:45.560 --> 36:46.615
Predecessor is right.

36:46.640 --> 36:48.575
He is in fact deceased.

36:50.600 --> 36:53.695
Yes, I'm afraid
John has died.

36:53.720 --> 36:55.415
Died?

36:55.440 --> 36:57.495
He fell down some
stairs, poor chap.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.055
Right.

37:08.520 --> 37:10.227
The Americans want us
to let 100,000 Jews

37:10.227 --> 37:11.935
into what they allege

37:11.960 --> 37:13.615
is their homeland.

37:13.640 --> 37:15.327
The Arabs, understandably,

37:15.327 --> 37:17.015
would prefer we did
no such thing.

37:17.040 --> 37:18.495
There's only one
thing for it -

37:18.520 --> 37:19.975
a committee.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.108
You'll be joined by some

37:22.108 --> 37:24.215
civil servants, academics
and Yanks.

37:24.240 --> 37:26.215
I have no expertise
in foreign policy.

37:26.240 --> 37:27.488
Well, for 2,000 years
people with expertise

37:27.488 --> 37:28.735
have failed to solve

37:28.760 --> 37:30.375
this conundrum, so
not to worry.

37:30.400 --> 37:32.735
This is just for show,
isn't it?

37:32.760 --> 37:34.975
To show whom what?

37:35.000 --> 37:37.495
To show the Americans that
we are pretending to take

37:37.520 --> 37:38.828
their concerns seriously

37:38.828 --> 37:40.135
when we all know there's

37:40.160 --> 37:40.295
no way in hell we can
risk upsetting

37:40.320 --> 37:44.975
the Arabs and our
access to oil.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.655
And the Palestine problem
is insoluble.

37:47.680 --> 37:49.935
Correct.
- Hugh, what if it's not?

38:25.280 --> 38:28.575
We thought, well, if you can't
get the perfect wedding cake,

38:28.600 --> 38:30.455
get a cake that looks perfect.

38:30.480 --> 38:32.055
How are we going to cut it?

38:32.080 --> 38:34.615
Joanna, it's fine,
we'll just pretend.

38:34.640 --> 38:37.375
We'll just stand over
here, not talk to anyone.

38:37.400 --> 38:38.375
OK.

38:50.120 --> 38:51.335
Excuse me.

39:05.800 --> 39:07.735
I'm sick of this war.

39:08.960 --> 39:11.135
Have you tried the food?
It tastes like paper.

39:11.160 --> 39:12.615
The war's over, actually.

39:14.120 --> 39:15.935
Oh, you think you're
so bloody young.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.415
Mummy, please just have a
glass of water.

39:19.440 --> 39:21.575
Here, please.

39:21.600 --> 39:23.095
We've got a lot of guests.

39:23.120 --> 39:24.535
It's going to be a long night.

39:26.480 --> 39:27.775
What is your point?

39:27.800 --> 39:30.095
That you're swaying slightly
and no music is playing.

39:32.240 --> 39:38.135
My sister and I used to dance
when there was no music.

39:38.160 --> 39:42.135
And we used to run fast,

39:42.160 --> 39:47.255
fast, fast, fast, like colts.

39:50.160 --> 39:53.015
My father used to call us
his "little colts".

39:53.040 --> 39:56.015
Yes, and now maybe
no more wine?

39:57.760 --> 40:01.215
Oh, you're in charge now...

40:01.240 --> 40:04.775
...now that you have a
very important job.

40:04.800 --> 40:07.575
You can run the show
and you can tell people

40:07.600 --> 40:10.095
when they may or may not imbibe.

40:11.480 --> 40:13.295
May I breathe,
is that all right?

40:13.320 --> 40:15.255
Stop it.

40:15.280 --> 40:17.375
May I defecate? No more
bloody wine, Mother.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.775
Ladies don't have ink
on their fingers.

40:21.800 --> 40:24.095
They never get a beau
with ink on their fingers.

40:24.120 --> 40:26.055
I came here with someone.

40:26.080 --> 40:29.535
You'll be a blue stocking by the
time they're through with you.

40:29.560 --> 40:31.215
Shhh!
- A bloody lesbian.

40:31.240 --> 40:33.375
Oh, we both know Freddie's
the one who's a homosexual.

40:33.400 --> 40:34.415
No!
Are you all right?

40:50.240 --> 40:52.575
It's fine. I just banged
my cheek, it was silly.

40:52.600 --> 40:54.775
Yeah, I saw how you banged it.

40:58.120 --> 41:00.615
Let me see. Let me see!

41:04.160 --> 41:05.655
There's a little bit of blood.
Her ring.

41:05.680 --> 41:08.255
It's fine, it's just she had
a little too much to drink.

41:08.280 --> 41:09.735
I was being annoying.

41:09.760 --> 41:11.135
I doubt that.
- It's fine.

41:11.160 --> 41:12.415
Listen...

41:24.480 --> 41:25.775
Is that all right?

41:27.800 --> 41:30.215
I worry I'll get you
into a lot of trouble.

41:32.400 --> 41:33.975
I want trouble.

42:53.040 --> 42:54.295
Come on!

43:07.480 --> 43:08.495
Move!

43:09.640 --> 43:10.895
Come on!

43:13.840 --> 43:17.335
Come on. You're going to be fine.

43:17.360 --> 43:20.375
You didn't dodge 1,000
bullets to get killed by a snake!

43:24.400 --> 43:26.215
Tell my ma I was a Nazi.

43:29.640 --> 43:31.015
She'll feel better that way.

43:35.520 --> 43:38.375
No, no, no!

43:38.400 --> 43:39.695
'N0.1!

44:25.680 --> 44:27.935
You're a bad, bad, bad, bad man.

44:30.960 --> 44:32.375
Fuck off.

45:01.480 --> 45:03.135
How do you like your new flat?

45:08.080 --> 45:10.815
Please don't ask me any
more about Hugh.

45:10.840 --> 45:14.735
I think he's a good man and I have
to be able to get up in the morning.

45:14.760 --> 45:16.935
I have to be able to look
at myself in the mirror.

45:27.160 --> 45:30.935
My predecessor was called
Philip Jarvis, wasn't he?

45:33.880 --> 45:35.855
What do you know about Jarvis?

45:35.880 --> 45:38.575
Well, I know he checked out
the same two files as I did

45:38.600 --> 45:39.815
and I know he's dead.

45:41.600 --> 45:45.295
I trusted Peter and Peter's gone,
I have to be able to trust you.

45:45.320 --> 45:46.855
You can trust me.

45:46.880 --> 45:48.855
You're telling me the truth?
- Yes.

45:48.180 --> 45:49.315
What happened to Jarvis?

45:49.340 --> 45:50.635
They murdered him.

45:51.660 --> 45:52.675
The Russians.

45:55.420 --> 45:57.155
And what if they murder me?

45:58.305 --> 46:04.842
