♪ <i>Teen Titans, go ♪</i>

00:42.216 --> 00:44.087
Oh, just say your thing
already, dude.

00:44.131 --> 00:46.568
I have received
a correspondence

00:46.611 --> 00:48.831
of the most
consequential nature.

00:48.874 --> 00:50.398
Why's you talking so weird?

00:50.441 --> 00:52.574
Is friend Robin having
the concussion?

00:52.617 --> 00:54.097
I've got some important mail.

00:54.141 --> 00:57.448
It's an invitation to the
Wayne Manor Regency Ball.

00:59.668 --> 01:01.583
Stop!

01:01.626 --> 01:03.715
This isn't a typical
house party.

01:03.759 --> 01:05.195
It's a rich people party.

01:05.239 --> 01:06.805
A sophisticated affair

01:06.849 --> 01:10.244
in a world of wealth,
refinement and manners.

01:10.287 --> 01:12.550
Will they have party size
potato chips?

01:12.594 --> 01:14.117
No!

01:14.161 --> 01:17.120
More importantly,
there are rumors
that Bruce Wayne

01:17.164 --> 01:19.383
will finally name an heir
to his manor.

01:19.427 --> 01:21.951
It could only go
to a true gentleman.

01:21.994 --> 01:26.086
A master of conversation,
grace and manners.

01:26.129 --> 01:27.348
Let me guess.

01:27.391 --> 01:28.958
You think you're
that true gentleman?

01:29.001 --> 01:30.307
Of course.

01:30.351 --> 01:33.397
Ooh, the ball sounds
the romantic.

01:33.441 --> 01:35.182
Yeah, about that.

01:35.225 --> 01:38.750
I think this party
is a bit too fancy
for your tastes.

01:38.794 --> 01:39.751
But, but, but...

01:39.795 --> 01:40.970
Exactly.

01:41.013 --> 01:42.754
It's always butts
with you guys.

01:42.798 --> 01:45.366
Now, promise not to go.

01:45.409 --> 01:46.671
Fine.

01:46.715 --> 01:48.673
We promise not to go.

01:48.717 --> 01:52.764
Good. Now,
if you'll all excuse me,
I must prepare for the ball.

02:03.384 --> 02:08.345
Presenting the ruler
of Atlantis, defender of seas
and friend to fish

02:08.389 --> 02:10.478
Arthur Curry, the Aquaman.

02:12.219 --> 02:15.831
And that's why no man is a man
without a personal chef.

02:21.793 --> 02:24.970
Presenting Raven, daughter
of Trigon the Terrible.

02:25.014 --> 02:26.363
What?

02:26.407 --> 02:29.540
Half man, half machine,
all handsome.

02:29.584 --> 02:32.630
Sir Cyborg. Booyah.

02:32.674 --> 02:35.024
The princess who will do
the good socializing

02:35.067 --> 02:37.287
and is the fanciest
of the schmanciest,

02:37.331 --> 02:39.071
Starfire.

02:39.115 --> 02:42.205
And the illest, chillest,
never going to get your Phyllis

02:42.249 --> 02:45.339
nonstop party train
this place about to go insane,

02:45.382 --> 02:47.558
super duke, Beast Boy.

02:47.602 --> 02:49.169
This place is amazing.

02:49.212 --> 02:52.172
Alfred will introduce you
however you want, yo.

02:52.215 --> 02:53.564
What are you guys doing here?

02:53.608 --> 02:55.566
A super duke goes
where he pleases.

02:55.610 --> 02:56.610
Speaking of which,

02:58.047 --> 03:00.180
Alfred, I gots to tinkle.

03:00.223 --> 03:02.312
You know what to do.

03:03.922 --> 03:06.186
Presenting the illest, chillest...

03:06.229 --> 03:09.145
I am going to be the butterfly
that is the social.

03:10.407 --> 03:12.453
Just don't embarrass me, okay?

03:12.496 --> 03:15.543
Be cool, have an hors d'oeuvre,
watch a pheasant race.

03:15.586 --> 03:17.022
Pheasant race?

03:17.066 --> 03:18.894
I've never seen
a pheasant race before.

03:18.937 --> 03:20.374
I've never seen a pheasant.

03:26.031 --> 03:27.816
I could get used to this place.

03:27.859 --> 03:29.296
Yeah, I'll be sure
to let you visit.

03:29.339 --> 03:31.472
Or maybe I'll be sure
to let <i>you</i> visit.

03:31.515 --> 03:34.126
- What?
- I is as gentlemanly
as you, fool.

03:34.170 --> 03:35.693
Why can't I be the heir?

03:35.737 --> 03:38.043
You know, I'd look good
as a bust.

03:38.087 --> 03:40.263
Fine. A gentleman-off it is.

03:40.307 --> 03:44.180
The first essential
gentleman skill
is conversation.

03:46.400 --> 03:49.751
A true gentleman entrances
a party through words alone.

03:49.794 --> 03:51.666
I'm gonna crush
this conversation, yo.

03:51.709 --> 03:53.320
I's a great listener.

03:53.363 --> 03:57.454
Gentlemen don't listen.
They're too busy speaking.

03:57.498 --> 04:01.502
Just because a pig has a pen,
doesn't mean he can write.

04:05.157 --> 04:06.507
Yo! What was that?

04:06.550 --> 04:08.030
A mildly amusing pun.

04:08.073 --> 04:10.250
One of the tools
in the conversational arsenal.

04:10.293 --> 04:13.557
Like stories of being rich
or philosophical nonsense.

04:13.601 --> 04:15.385
Philosophical nonsense?

04:15.429 --> 04:18.910
Is the sky blue
or is everything else
simply not blue?

04:21.522 --> 04:23.915
I thinks I get it.

04:23.959 --> 04:26.222
Washed hands
are never cleaneth.

04:28.616 --> 04:30.705
Trees are just tall bushes.

04:32.707 --> 04:35.579
A chair is a table you sit on.

04:35.623 --> 04:38.974
The holiest cheese is Swiss.

04:39.017 --> 04:41.150
Uh, a light switch?

04:41.193 --> 04:45.241
Why's you gotta switch
between lights?

04:48.679 --> 04:51.856
Weekends are also week starts.

04:51.900 --> 04:53.684
Don't fish for compliments
without bait.

04:55.033 --> 04:56.252
I once met a governor.

05:00.561 --> 05:04.129
Consider yourself gentleman-ed.

05:04.173 --> 05:08.351
You have the shiny trident.
And you have the shiny tiara.

05:08.395 --> 05:10.266
Have you considered the dating?

05:13.748 --> 05:16.707
Joy! I have created
the love connection.

05:19.101 --> 05:22.322
Oh, so many of the guests
look the lonely.

05:22.365 --> 05:24.715
I must do more
of the matchmaking.

05:26.761 --> 05:29.764
I believe you two
were meant for each other.

05:29.807 --> 05:32.680
Please do not question
the heart.

05:44.039 --> 05:45.432
So cool!

05:45.475 --> 05:47.434
Who's the favorite
in the next race?

05:47.477 --> 05:50.741
Hmm. Looks like the favorite
is Pumpkin Gold Hairnet.

05:50.785 --> 05:52.134
Ooh, he's fast.

05:52.177 --> 05:54.266
Wait, who's that?

05:54.310 --> 05:55.746
That's Thanksgiving Leftovers.

05:57.922 --> 06:00.098
Aw, it says here
she's never won.

06:00.142 --> 06:01.622
And nobody believes in her.

06:03.450 --> 06:04.625
That's so sad.

06:07.192 --> 06:10.805
Raven, we're going to make
Thanksgiving Leftovers
a champion.

06:14.286 --> 06:18.378
The next gentleman skill...
The Dance.

06:18.421 --> 06:20.728
Yo, I's a master dancer.

06:20.771 --> 06:21.771
What the...

06:23.818 --> 06:25.297
What's going on now?

06:25.341 --> 06:26.777
This is Regency Dance.

06:26.821 --> 06:30.302
It's about grace, control...

06:30.346 --> 06:32.000
...and elegance.

06:32.043 --> 06:34.524
Regency dance?
Why didn't you say so?

06:39.747 --> 06:41.792
Oh yeah, boy. Check this out.

06:57.242 --> 07:00.376
Consider yourself
gentleman-ed, fool.

07:00.420 --> 07:03.031
I believe you two
are the lovely couple.

07:08.036 --> 07:09.646
And you two are also the match.

07:11.866 --> 07:14.259
And you the match. The match.

07:14.303 --> 07:18.133
The match. The match.
The match. The match.

07:18.176 --> 07:20.091
All right,
Thanksgiving Leftovers,

07:20.135 --> 07:22.703
we are gonna get you
into shape.

07:22.746 --> 07:25.009
Lift, Thanksgiving Leftovers.
Lift!

07:27.142 --> 07:28.317
All right!

07:35.498 --> 07:39.023
Yes, Thanksgiving Leftovers.
You're doing it.

07:39.067 --> 07:41.809
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

07:41.852 --> 07:46.117
Ooh. Okay,
Thanksgiving Leftovers.
We believe in you.

07:46.161 --> 07:48.685
No, no, don't look at
Pumpkin Gold Hairnet.

07:48.729 --> 07:49.729
Focus.

07:51.514 --> 07:53.560
Pheasants, on your marks.

07:54.125 --> 07:55.431
Ready!

07:55.475 --> 07:56.475
Steady!

07:59.261 --> 08:01.306
-Go!
Yeah!

08:01.350 --> 08:03.961
-Run Thanksgiving Leftovers.
-We believe in you!
Yeah, awesome!

08:06.486 --> 08:08.531
Woo-hoo!

08:08.575 --> 08:11.273
Lefts!
We believe in you!

08:13.405 --> 08:14.798
Yay!

08:14.842 --> 08:16.670
Woo-hoo! Yeah!

08:20.500 --> 08:25.461
Looks like the heir
will be decided by
their dining etiquette.

08:25.505 --> 08:28.551
Beast Boy, you love salad.
You go first.

08:28.595 --> 08:31.162
Okay, I'll just, uh...

08:34.209 --> 08:36.690
Oh, what's the matter?

08:36.733 --> 08:38.474
Can't find the salad fork?

08:38.518 --> 08:42.696
No, no, no. I's a gentleman.
I know it's, uh, this one.

08:42.739 --> 08:46.134
- Ha! That's a fish fork.
- I meant this one.

08:46.917 --> 08:48.353
Fruit fork.

08:50.007 --> 08:51.879
Fruit don't need no fork.

08:51.922 --> 08:53.683
Dinner fork, soup spoon,
butter knife, butter spoon,

08:53.707 --> 08:57.885
nut scoop, ham fork, ham spoon
and finally, salad fork.

09:02.019 --> 09:05.501
I did it.
I'm the gentlemanliest
gentleman.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.372
Go Robin, you're the gentleman.

09:07.416 --> 09:09.418
You're so proper.
Gets the manor.

09:09.461 --> 09:10.680
Ooh, ooh.

09:10.724 --> 09:12.421
Dancing on the table, bro?
Uh-uh.

09:12.464 --> 09:13.814
Not very gentlemanly.

09:13.857 --> 09:16.991
In fact, one might
call it uncouth.

09:18.470 --> 09:20.429
What did you call me?

09:20.472 --> 09:22.779
You heard me. You's uncouth.

09:22.823 --> 09:24.955
That's not a word
to use lightly.

09:29.220 --> 09:30.700
I challenge you to a duel.

09:30.744 --> 09:32.920
Oh-ho-ho. I know you did not
just slap me

09:32.963 --> 09:34.312
with your baby hand glove.

09:34.356 --> 09:35.618
A duel, good sir,

09:35.662 --> 09:37.359
to end this rivalry
once and for all.

09:37.402 --> 09:39.317
I'ma duel on your face, son.

09:41.058 --> 09:42.886
You know the rules of the duel.

09:42.930 --> 09:45.715
Everybody knows the rules
to badminton, fool.

09:56.117 --> 09:58.336
Ha! I's got advantage.

09:58.380 --> 10:00.338
Oops. Racket slipped.

10:00.382 --> 10:02.210
You meant to do that, yo.

10:02.253 --> 10:05.474
If I did, there's nothing wrong
with a little gamesmanship.

10:05.517 --> 10:08.172
Gamesmanship?
I'll show you gamesmanship.

10:11.698 --> 10:13.308
How's that for gamesmanship?

10:17.094 --> 10:18.400
It's on.

10:35.112 --> 10:40.378
I am pleased to announce
that Master Wayne has chosen
the heir to Wayne Manor.

10:40.422 --> 10:42.032
Finally.

10:42.076 --> 10:45.427
Wayne Manor will be left to
Master Wayne's new bride,

10:45.470 --> 10:49.213
champion race pheasant,
Thanksgiving Leftovers.

10:49.257 --> 10:50.475
What?

10:50.519 --> 10:52.782
I was the one who matched them.

10:56.612 --> 10:58.614
No!
