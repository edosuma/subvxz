15:45.082 --> 15:47.360
Now, clean it.

15:47.429 --> 15:49.500
And do it thoroughly this time.

15:49.569 --> 15:50.915
I will send Thom up.

15:50.984 --> 15:52.468
Only if you would have him
watch you

15:52.537 --> 15:55.092
on your knees,
like a woman.

15:56.852 --> 15:58.509
Clean it.

15:59.303 --> 16:00.338
Now.

16:02.823 --> 16:04.894
Where are we going, Mother?

16:04.964 --> 16:06.724
To visit Claudette

16:06.793 --> 16:09.106
so that you can see
what awaits you

16:09.175 --> 16:11.729
when you choose your husband.

16:11.798 --> 16:14.904
Claudette came here
just like you, with nothing,

16:14.974 --> 16:17.562
and now she has a husband,

16:17.631 --> 16:19.116
land

16:19.185 --> 16:20.669
and a fortune of children.

16:20.738 --> 16:22.843
Does she live near where
the massacre happened?

16:22.912 --> 16:24.052
SABRINE:
Not far.

16:24.121 --> 16:25.846
There is nothing to worry about.

16:25.915 --> 16:27.538
We will be well watched.

16:27.607 --> 16:30.437
And, besides,
Captain Bouchard has assured me

16:30.506 --> 16:32.129
that the Iroquois have moved on.

16:32.198 --> 16:33.716
MELISSANDE:
It'’s no wonder they moved on.

16:33.785 --> 16:36.926
Only a witch would live
in this squalor.

16:36.996 --> 16:40.275
Mother Sabrine would not bring
us here unless it were safe.

16:40.344 --> 16:41.172
[scoffs]

16:41.241 --> 16:43.968
All witches possess a mark.

16:44.037 --> 16:46.350
What is yours?
[snickers]

16:46.419 --> 16:47.454
Ow.

16:49.422 --> 16:51.355
[scoffs]

16:51.424 --> 16:54.185
[chickens clucking]

16:54.254 --> 16:56.015
[goat bleating]

16:57.326 --> 16:58.948
Mother Sabrine,

16:59.018 --> 17:01.330
I apologize, as I'’m not prepared
to accept visitors yet.

17:01.399 --> 17:04.782
My child,
there is no need to apologize.

17:04.851 --> 17:07.405
What is this, Claudette?

17:07.474 --> 17:09.752
Mother Sabrine
has blessed us with a visit.

17:09.821 --> 17:12.824
-[children shouting]
-We are simply here to say
good day and to speak

17:12.893 --> 17:14.343
-of women'’s business.
-[clanging]

17:14.412 --> 17:17.001
-Women'’s business?
-Yes.

17:17.070 --> 17:19.762
Those things that men prefer
not to think about.

17:19.831 --> 17:21.419
Of course.

17:21.488 --> 17:24.733
[children chattering, giggling]

17:28.219 --> 17:31.498
DELPHINE: [gasps]
Oh, my. Here.

17:31.567 --> 17:33.121
What happened?

17:33.190 --> 17:35.261
MELISSANDE:
One must be careful
when one bounds around

17:35.330 --> 17:36.641
with such abandonment,

17:36.710 --> 17:39.541
for God will smite you
where you stand.

17:45.823 --> 17:48.308
[creaking]

17:52.795 --> 17:55.660
[grunts, panting]

17:59.354 --> 18:01.425
I am away to town.

18:01.494 --> 18:03.599
-I will return before sundown.
-[sniffles]

18:03.668 --> 18:04.911
Two dozen more,

18:04.980 --> 18:06.878
and you are good on your day,
Monsieur Sel.

18:06.947 --> 18:09.018
-RENE: Okay.
-[exhales]

18:09.088 --> 18:11.607
Ah, the light.

18:11.676 --> 18:13.506
[exhales]

18:13.575 --> 18:18.442
You see how it shines
right through me?

18:20.582 --> 18:21.859
No.

18:21.928 --> 18:25.794
You are ignorant of the light.

18:25.863 --> 18:29.418
Soon, you will be learned
on the bend of it.

18:31.524 --> 18:33.836
What are we cutting
the trees for?

18:33.905 --> 18:35.321
To build. To raise up.

18:35.390 --> 18:37.840
You'’ll see.

18:37.909 --> 18:40.602
Two dozen more.

18:41.810 --> 18:43.881
[exhales]

18:43.950 --> 18:45.917
Shall I take up the search
for Duquet after I'’m done?

18:45.986 --> 18:47.436
No, no, no, no.

18:47.505 --> 18:50.439
We will endure
without the rat'’s presence.

18:55.168 --> 18:57.584
[insects trilling]

19:15.982 --> 19:18.743
[laughter]

19:18.812 --> 19:22.299

-Please, I mean no harm.

[groaning, laughter]

20:31.057 --> 20:33.508
[laughter]

20:49.213 --> 20:51.146
What is that?

20:51.215 --> 20:53.942
[chuckles]
Yes.

20:54.011 --> 20:56.358
It does resemble a fox.

20:57.601 --> 20:59.913
I shall call you...

20:59.982 --> 21:02.571
Renardette

21:02.640 --> 21:04.055
until you find your proper name.

21:04.124 --> 21:06.299
Hmm?

21:10.441 --> 21:12.892
Come. Sit.

21:12.961 --> 21:15.584
Okay.

21:31.186 --> 21:33.119
We shall burn it.

21:33.188 --> 21:35.432
That is the fix.

21:38.573 --> 21:41.714
It will be gone from this world.

21:48.548 --> 21:51.413
My Veronique

21:51.482 --> 21:53.657
had such poor hair.

21:54.623 --> 21:57.661
Coarse and unruly.

21:58.834 --> 22:01.699
Like hay stalks.
[chuckles]

22:03.529 --> 22:06.532
But you, my dear...

22:06.601 --> 22:10.536
[sighs]
...have the most beautiful hair.

22:10.605 --> 22:12.710
It'’s fine,

22:12.779 --> 22:14.781
and shiny.

22:22.444 --> 22:24.343
Which do you fancy?

22:26.345 --> 22:28.795
The blue?

22:28.864 --> 22:31.488
Very well.

22:31.557 --> 22:34.111
We will start with the blue.

22:34.180 --> 22:36.734
It will bring out
the color of your eyes.

22:41.256 --> 22:43.431
[panting]

22:47.262 --> 22:49.022
Stand guard over him.

22:49.091 --> 22:51.197
Should I send
for one of his own?

22:51.266 --> 22:53.682
No. If the Jesuits take him,

22:53.751 --> 22:55.201
then we won'’t get
his full account

22:55.270 --> 22:57.583
of what happened out there.

23:03.140 --> 23:05.142
[insects trilling]

23:19.639 --> 23:22.090
[speaks Wendat]

23:51.222 --> 23:53.224
[chickens clucking]

23:56.538 --> 23:59.161
I'’ve been sent to fetch you
for Mother Sabrine.

23:59.230 --> 24:00.439
[Claudette sniffles]

24:00.508 --> 24:02.682
[shudders]

24:05.444 --> 24:07.584
What is wrong?

24:07.653 --> 24:09.171
[sniffles]
I'’m fine.

24:09.240 --> 24:11.657
It'’s nothing.

24:11.726 --> 24:13.555
Nothing about this place
is fine.

24:13.624 --> 24:17.145
But it can be made better.

24:18.215 --> 24:20.217
Not my husband.

24:20.286 --> 24:22.495
He cannot be made better.

24:22.564 --> 24:24.186
[sniffles]

24:24.255 --> 24:25.394
I picked wrong.

24:25.464 --> 24:26.706
[shudders]

24:26.775 --> 24:28.708
You still have a chance.

24:28.777 --> 24:30.192
Whomever you pick,

24:30.261 --> 24:32.367
make sure he lives
within the walls of Wobik.

24:32.436 --> 24:34.058
I can assure you,

24:34.127 --> 24:36.164
I will choose my husband
with more wisdom

24:36.233 --> 24:37.752
as to his land and station.

24:39.719 --> 24:42.653
We'’re only here
to spread our legs

24:42.722 --> 24:44.966
and let men seed our wombs
for New France.

24:45.035 --> 24:46.243
Don'’t be stupid.

24:46.312 --> 24:47.451
Shut your legs.

24:47.520 --> 24:49.695
[scoffs]
I can'’t do that.

24:49.764 --> 24:51.351
Then take a knife to his wick.

24:51.420 --> 24:53.699
You'’ve done your share,

24:53.768 --> 24:56.874
already borne him
three children.

24:58.393 --> 24:59.912
Four.

25:01.120 --> 25:03.018
-I'’m pregnant.
-[sighs]

25:03.087 --> 25:05.469
The last one nearly killed me.

25:05.538 --> 25:07.540
This one certainly will.

25:07.609 --> 25:09.197
You mustn'’t let it.

25:10.267 --> 25:12.372
Take the trade, Claudette.

25:12.441 --> 25:14.823
Live to raise your children.

25:18.102 --> 25:21.727
-Are you suggesting...
-If you want to live,
there is a way.

25:22.900 --> 25:24.246
No.

25:24.315 --> 25:27.629
-No, I-I can'’t.
-I saw some cohash over here.

25:27.698 --> 25:30.149
My mother showed me
how to use it.

25:31.495 --> 25:33.773
I will show you. Come.

25:50.756 --> 25:52.965
Here, give me your hand.

25:53.034 --> 25:55.001
Chew them.

25:56.762 --> 25:59.074
Your child will be no more.

26:07.393 --> 26:09.568
[indistinct conversation]

26:14.400 --> 26:15.884
French?

26:15.953 --> 26:18.093
[scoffs]

26:20.337 --> 26:22.857
Charles Duquet.

26:22.926 --> 26:24.928
Where are you from?

26:24.997 --> 26:27.793
-I was born near St. Germain.
-No.

26:27.862 --> 26:29.967
In New France.
Who do you serve?

26:30.036 --> 26:31.590
Who do you belong to?

26:31.659 --> 26:34.662
Help me escape these savages.
They have tortured me.

26:34.731 --> 26:36.767
I swear I will serve
and earn my keep.

26:42.290 --> 26:44.050
Mr. Duquet, is it?

26:44.810 --> 26:46.743
We speak your language,

26:46.812 --> 26:48.779
and we speak it quite well.

26:50.160 --> 26:53.646
Sachem, I apologize on behalf
of this fellow Frenchman.

26:53.715 --> 26:55.199
Uh...

26:55.268 --> 26:58.686
take these needles
in amends for his insults.

26:58.755 --> 27:01.378
You don'’t want him?

27:01.447 --> 27:02.724
No.

27:02.793 --> 27:04.623
Let him be yourburden now.

27:04.692 --> 27:06.383
[chuckles]

27:18.671 --> 27:20.984
RENE:
Is this what
you wanted to show me?

27:21.053 --> 27:22.951
MARI:
No, it'’s not.

27:23.020 --> 27:24.090
Come.

27:27.024 --> 27:30.649
This is my secret, Rene.

27:30.718 --> 27:32.789
-Trepagny owns this?
-[laughs]

27:32.858 --> 27:35.274
He has a piece of paper
that says he does,

27:35.343 --> 27:38.587
from a king who has never
set foot in this world.

27:38.657 --> 27:41.038
But it doesn'’t matter.

27:41.107 --> 27:44.801
It is Trepagny'’s,
and therefore it will be Theo'’s.

27:47.182 --> 27:49.115
RENE:
It'’s beautiful.

27:51.048 --> 27:52.878
Come.

28:02.370 --> 28:04.406
[sloshing steps]

28:28.465 --> 28:30.260
Does it have a name?

28:30.329 --> 28:32.262
[speaks Wendat]

28:32.331 --> 28:36.335
Does it not exist if it doesn'’t
have a name in your language?

28:38.578 --> 28:40.511
It'’s just a lake.

28:43.307 --> 28:46.241
There are many more like it
over that rise.

28:46.310 --> 28:49.486
Come. I will show you
something else you can'’t name.

29:02.602 --> 29:03.914
Mari?

29:03.983 --> 29:05.605
[quietly]:
Mari...

29:05.674 --> 29:07.159
-[exhales]
-[splash]

29:07.228 --> 29:08.436
Mari?

29:33.081 --> 29:35.256
[door creaks]

29:53.170 --> 29:55.863
The girl and the priest,
where are they?

29:56.760 --> 29:59.176
I don'’t like being snuck up on.

29:59.245 --> 30:02.593
Well, I don'’t enjoy hearing news
secondhand, Mathilde. [grunts]

30:02.662 --> 30:04.664
[chuckles]
Serves you right.

30:04.733 --> 30:07.253
Where are they?

30:09.497 --> 30:11.464
The priest, he is mad.

30:11.533 --> 30:14.743
He is in the stables
talking to horses.

30:14.813 --> 30:18.506
The girl... bring her to me
at the cooperage.

30:18.575 --> 30:22.475
Mr. Goames is seeing
to her recovery.

30:22.544 --> 30:25.824
You would do well
to steer clear of this, Gus.

30:25.893 --> 30:29.310
Oh. Hmm. [chuckles]

30:33.555 --> 30:35.557
[indistinct chatter]

30:38.629 --> 30:40.804
My letter?

30:40.873 --> 30:43.151
Don'’t believe you'’ve
received one this week.

30:43.220 --> 30:46.465
Look. Look!
It will be there.

30:49.123 --> 30:52.574
It is a letter from
Monsieur Nicolas de Fer

30:52.643 --> 30:55.129
regarding my application
for a fille du roi.

30:57.407 --> 30:59.547
There is no...

30:59.616 --> 31:02.584
Ah, yes.
From Québec City.

31:02.653 --> 31:04.621
The Intendant'’s seal.

31:29.301 --> 31:31.959
I am to have a wife.

31:33.201 --> 31:35.514
I am to have a wife.

31:37.274 --> 31:39.932
I am to have a wife!

31:40.001 --> 31:42.176
[indistinct chatter]

32:14.967 --> 32:17.763
How is she?

32:17.832 --> 32:19.765
The same.

32:19.834 --> 32:22.147
Shaking like a leaf, poor thing.

32:22.216 --> 32:25.702
Aye. I wish to discover
her name.

32:25.771 --> 32:27.669
Reunite her with her family.

32:27.738 --> 32:30.500
She will have to be
watched over.

32:30.569 --> 32:33.054
Well, she seems comfortable
with you.

32:33.123 --> 32:35.574
Of course I will
watch over her.

32:35.643 --> 32:38.957
That is not what I meant.

32:39.026 --> 32:40.613
Say it, Mathilde.

32:43.858 --> 32:46.033
Gus Lafarge came '’round
to see her.

32:46.102 --> 32:48.138
-Well, does he know her?
-No.

32:48.207 --> 32:50.002
And she was not with
the families out there,

32:50.071 --> 32:52.073
of that I am sure.

32:52.142 --> 32:54.144
She is a mystery, then.

32:55.766 --> 32:57.561
[whispering]:
I would feel better

32:57.630 --> 32:59.978
with a man with your skills
at hand.

33:00.047 --> 33:02.014
Gus Lafarge will come back.
