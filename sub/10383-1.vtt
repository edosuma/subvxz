that Burkhart surfs
for all the wrong reasons.

a single-fin mentality.

with lots more rocker.

one way.

The right way.

I didn't come to you.

the board the way
Burkhart wanted it?

I mean,
it is Lance Burkhart.

27:41.293 --> 27:44.731
You wouldn't understand.
I'm goin' out.

27:44.764 --> 27:46.332
I'm goin' with you.
(SARCASTICALLY)
Oh, really?

27:46.365 --> 27:48.067
Yeah.

27:48.100 --> 27:49.769
You got any pointers?

27:49.802 --> 27:51.971
About pipe?
Yeah, you're not
ready for it.

27:52.004 --> 27:54.106
I'm ready.
Oh, yeah?

27:54.774 --> 27:56.242
Okay, brah.

27:56.275 --> 27:58.344
The reef starts
just about here

27:58.377 --> 28:00.046
and it stretches
all the way down
to there.

28:00.079 --> 28:02.081
Reef?
There's a reef?
That's right.

28:02.114 --> 28:05.017
So when the wave
breaks here,
don't be there

28:05.051 --> 28:06.418
or you're gonna
get drilled.

28:06.452 --> 28:07.754
(CHUCKLES)

28:08.454 --> 28:09.822
Anything else?

28:11.023 --> 28:13.025
You really coming?
Yeah.

28:13.059 --> 28:15.227
Came 4,000 miles
for this.

28:15.261 --> 28:17.997
If you bail
before the wave breaks,
get behind it.

28:18.030 --> 28:20.199
Otherwise, it might
wash you into one of
those caves down there.

28:20.232 --> 28:22.001
You might not find
your way out.

28:22.034 --> 28:25.104
They're always pullin'
bodies out of the caves.
Anything else?

28:25.137 --> 28:27.874
TURTLE: There's the sharks.
RICK: Sharks?

28:27.907 --> 28:30.409
TURTLE: Yeah, somebody yells
in time for you to pull up
your feet...

28:31.143 --> 28:32.411
Usually.

28:32.444 --> 28:34.113
RICK: Great,
I feel much better.

29:03.209 --> 29:05.878
RICK: Look, Burkhart.
He makes it look
so easy.

29:08.480 --> 29:10.216
It's getting awfully big
out here.

29:12.952 --> 29:15.354
I guess you surf waves
like this all the time, huh?

29:16.155 --> 29:17.189
Yeah.

29:36.042 --> 29:37.409
Hey, not this one.

29:41.313 --> 29:42.381
Okay, this one looks good.

29:46.152 --> 29:47.453
No, Kane,
not this one.

29:50.222 --> 29:52.058
Kane, no!
It's too deep!

30:24.356 --> 30:27.126
Rick! Rick, you took
a bad fall, man.

30:27.159 --> 30:28.861
Hey, look at your back.

30:28.895 --> 30:31.097
Look at my board!

30:31.130 --> 30:32.398
It was the only thing
I had left.

30:33.299 --> 30:34.833
I'll get
the other half.

30:51.150 --> 30:53.019
You get reef rash
if you don't put
something on those cuts.

30:53.519 --> 30:55.154
Reef rash?

30:55.187 --> 30:57.890
Heavy scar, brah.
Scar for life
for sure.

30:57.924 --> 30:59.992
There's bacteria in the coral.
It scars the skin.

31:00.026 --> 31:01.227
Show him, Pao.

31:03.295 --> 31:04.463
So what do I do?

31:04.496 --> 31:06.198
Scrub it, kook!
(CHUCKLES)

31:07.266 --> 31:08.267
Come with me.
I can help.

31:26.485 --> 31:29.221
(CHUCKLES)
You ride pretty good.
For a surfer.

31:30.622 --> 31:32.158
Well, I am
from Arizona.

31:33.592 --> 31:36.095
This your horse?
No, I work
at the stables.

31:38.397 --> 31:39.598
Thank you
for helping me.

31:40.699 --> 31:43.369
Come on, cowboy,
let's take care
of your back.

31:43.402 --> 31:44.503
Okay.

31:49.375 --> 31:51.610
RICK: What's that?
KIANI: The best thing
for a cut.

31:51.643 --> 31:53.079
A plant?

31:53.112 --> 31:55.247
Don't you use an
antiseptic or something?

31:55.281 --> 31:57.516
It's a natural antiseptic.
It's aloe.

31:58.717 --> 32:00.352
Lie down.

32:00.386 --> 32:01.453
(CHUCKLES)
Come on.

32:05.491 --> 32:07.359
You seem different
from the others.

32:07.393 --> 32:09.328
Ah! Ouch.

32:10.629 --> 32:12.298
You go to school
or anything?

32:13.599 --> 32:17.003
Yeah, I got a scholarship
to an art school.

32:17.036 --> 32:20.039
Bet you picked
a school where there's
good surf, yeah?

32:20.072 --> 32:22.041
Right, New York City.

32:23.475 --> 32:26.145
I hear the East River's got
some pretty radical waves!

32:26.178 --> 32:27.246
I'd like to go there.

32:27.646 --> 32:28.547
Why?

32:30.116 --> 32:31.383
I've been here
my whole life.

32:36.755 --> 32:38.490
You really know
what you're doing.

32:39.791 --> 32:41.527
I guess you've had a lot
of surfer boyfriends, huh?

32:43.695 --> 32:45.164
I've had a lot
of practice.

Oh.

33:01.313 --> 33:02.581
I guess you're okay now.

33:03.449 --> 33:05.551
I gotta go.

33:05.584 --> 33:08.087
Wha...
Keep putting this
on your cuts.

33:12.191 --> 33:13.625
And don't surf
such big waves.

you get drilled,

No, no hurry.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.581
What do you got
in the bag?

34:10.616 --> 34:13.752
I got it at the pawn shop.
I always wanted a set.

34:13.784 --> 34:15.154
My drawing tools!

34:16.688 --> 34:17.723

34:17.755 --> 34:19.824
They are.
They got stolen
from me yesterday.

My friend
from the mainland.

34:23.829 --> 34:24.795
These are yours?

34:26.364 --> 34:27.632
Prove it.

34:29.668 --> 34:33.105
There's a painting
under there.
I painted it.

34:33.139 --> 34:35.274
I worked all summer for these.
I paid 150 bucks for it.

34:37.275 --> 34:38.277

You painted this?

34:47.753 --> 34:49.288
Thank you.

34:49.321 --> 34:51.257
Twenty bucks.
What?

34:51.290 --> 34:52.658
I paid 20 bucks
for this.

34:54.793 --> 34:56.762
I would give it to you
if I had it,
but I don't.

34:56.795 --> 34:59.865
I got ripped off.
My wallet, my money...

34:59.898 --> 35:02.501

I don't even have
a place to stay.

I'll make you a deal.

this painting,

35:15.614 --> 35:18.384
do some sweeping up
around my shaping shack,

a place to sleep,

he hangs out with

to learn.

the outline.

41:12.604 --> 41:14.573
Once I cut the shape,

41:14.606 --> 41:16.942
I use the planer
to carve the rail
for a specific wave.

41:19.010 --> 41:22.180
The big Waimea.
Too low a rail,
you dig into the curl.

41:22.213 --> 41:24.616
Too high,
you get pitched
into the soup.

like this.

41:33.659 --> 41:36.094
think a wave's
just for carvin' up,
you know?

41:36.127 --> 41:39.931
Hot-dogging.
Imposing their own style
of acrobatics on the wave.

41:39.965 --> 41:42.701
RICK: What's wrong
with that?

41:42.734 --> 41:46.137
CHANDLER: I don't know.
A pure surfer
goes with the wave.

41:46.171 --> 41:47.839
I mean,
he knows the wave.

41:48.807 --> 41:51.242
He knows
where it breaks.

41:51.276 --> 41:53.211
The best spot to be.
He works with it.

41:54.813 --> 41:56.047
This is called
"leftovers" here.

41:56.081 --> 41:57.783
It channels right through
the middle.

41:59.651 --> 42:01.820
RICK:
This is Waimea?

42:01.853 --> 42:04.189
CHANDLER: Yeah,
it's flat today, so it's
a good day for looking.

42:04.222 --> 42:07.292
A lot of surfers never
even think about what's
under the water here.

42:07.325 --> 42:09.160
RICK: So why are we lookin'
at the reef?

42:10.261 --> 42:11.963
CHANDLER: You tell me.

42:11.997 --> 42:13.498
RICK: It has something
to do with the waves.

42:13.531 --> 42:16.568
CHANDLER: Right.
The reef affects
the shape of the wave.

42:16.602 --> 42:18.236
RICK: Really?

42:18.269 --> 42:20.138
CHANDLER: But if you hit
the reef, it affects the shape
of your head.

42:24.643 --> 42:26.845
All right,
you've learned
the waves.

42:26.878 --> 42:28.113

about a board.

42:28.146 --> 42:30.248

this one!

will you let me use it?

42:37.155 --> 42:39.257
When you're ready.

42:39.290 --> 42:41.092
But
only after you've
mastered all the others.

42:42.994 --> 42:45.797
Starting with this one.
Give me a hand.

42:48.767 --> 42:52.137
This isn't a surfboard,
it's an antique!

42:52.170 --> 42:55.140
What does it weigh,
100 pounds?
130.

42:55.173 --> 42:58.143
It's made from koa wood,
same way the ancient
Hawaiians made them.

43:00.879 --> 43:02.748
This is a canoe.

43:02.781 --> 43:05.050
And it's impossible to turn.
It doesn't even have a fin.

43:05.083 --> 43:06.918
Yes, it does.
Hey, whoa!

43:06.952 --> 43:09.721
There's your fin,
your inside foot.
You drag it in the water.

43:15.026 --> 43:16.695
There's one.
Go for it.

43:37.783 --> 43:39.050
Get up.
Drag your foot.

43:41.787 --> 43:43.121
Your inside foot!

43:45.757 --> 43:47.759
Whoo!
All right, you got it.

44:02.173 --> 44:05.043
Chandler,
that was amazing.

44:05.076 --> 44:06.778
If I move my foot
just a little bit,

44:06.812 --> 44:08.947
it really, really made
a big difference.
Yep.

44:08.980 --> 44:10.916
Looked good.
Yeah?

44:10.949 --> 44:12.183
Keep working.

44:17.422 --> 44:18.890

Yeah, it's better.

44:18.924 --> 44:20.091

57:05.690 --> 57:10.160
Yeah, right, design thing.
You designed me out
of the picture, haole!

57:10.194 --> 57:12.463
Here on the North Shore
we treat friends more better.

57:34.084 --> 57:35.620
(SIGHS)
Turtle, why don't
you come in?

Anela, can I use the bath?
Rick!

57:50.200 --> 57:54.839
Oh, what happened?
You go inside. I'll clean
you up right now.

57:56.707 --> 57:58.943
You go to Kawailoa
village, huh?

57:58.976 --> 58:02.046
Get in fight
over girl, huh?
Yeah.

58:02.079 --> 58:04.248
You know, I remember
Chandler used to fight

58:04.281 --> 58:06.551
with my brothers
all the time, too.

58:08.586 --> 58:10.921
Anela, are you
and Chandler happy?

58:10.955 --> 58:14.659
I mean, a haole surfer guy
and a local woman living here?

58:14.692 --> 58:16.627
(GROANS)
Are you happy?

58:17.962 --> 58:20.565
Other guy's Chandler's age,
they're mean, fat,

58:20.598 --> 58:23.000
watch TV, yell.

58:23.033 --> 58:27.037
Chandler, he's alive.
He loves the ocean.

58:27.805 --> 58:29.807
Chandler's a good man.

58:29.840 --> 58:31.809
You know, I'm pretty lucky.

58:32.910 --> 58:35.079
I think Chandler's
pretty lucky.

58:35.112 --> 58:36.647
(GIGGLING)

Hey, Rick, come on.
The Waimea's breaking.

58:50.761 --> 58:52.763
Whoa, what happened
to you?

58:52.797 --> 58:55.866
Oh, nothing.
I just got punched
by the reef, that's all.

58:55.900 --> 58:57.868
Reefs don't
punch like that.

58:59.369 --> 59:02.172
Did you get in a fight
over that local girl?
Jesus!

59:02.206 --> 59:04.875
It's impossible to keep
anything quiet around here.

59:07.111 --> 59:11.582
Hey, wait a minute.
That's Burkhart's board.
You're not ready for that.

59:11.616 --> 59:14.752
Chandler,
I used the semi-gun
at leftovers in Velzy,

59:14.785 --> 59:18.355
and then I used the...
That rhino chaser
over there at Sunset.

59:18.388 --> 59:20.758
And then I used this big gun
at Lani's and Pipeline.

59:20.791 --> 59:23.961
And the six-five thruster
at Backdoor.

59:28.165 --> 59:29.734
I guess you are ready
for that board.

59:31.101 --> 59:32.269
(LAUGHS)
All right!

59:34.639 --> 59:37.675
Hey, can we stop by the
sanding shack for a minute?
Sure. Why?

Where you going with that?

59:53.691 --> 59:57.862
Hey, Chandler.
Look at this.
I think it's great.

59:57.895 --> 01:00:00.030
CHANDLER: Whoa. Nice detail.

01:00:01.666 --> 01:00:03.133
Clean lines.

01:00:03.868 --> 01:00:05.836
Good balance.

01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:09.273
Classic big wave shape.
This is great!

01:00:09.306 --> 01:00:12.209
You did a great job, Rick.
I didn't shape it.

01:00:15.112 --> 01:00:18.916
Turtle?
You made this?

01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:24.354
You made a Big Gun?
(LAUGHS)

01:00:26.023 --> 01:00:27.758
It's beautiful, man.

01:00:29.459 --> 01:00:33.063
It's almost as good
as one of mine.
Oh, wow. Unreal.

Hey, listen, Waimea's
cranking right now.
We're just goin' out.

Come on.

Soul surfers?

Sounds hokey, doesn't it?

That's what the hot-doggers
call us old characters out
here on our big boards.

01:01:59.049 --> 01:02:02.152

are probably up at Pipeline,

the Pipe Classic.

That's Rick Kane.
He's a friend of
Chandler's and me.

Good, huh?
(CAMERA SHUTTER SNAPS)

01:04:14.151 --> 01:04:16.220
Yeah, he's got good
judgment. He knows
where the waves break.

Little bit of that
old style, yeah?

01:04:19.089 --> 01:04:21.258
You know if Kane's entered
in the Pipeline Classic?

01:04:21.291 --> 01:04:24.494
Naw. Chandler
wouldn't like that.

his own little world.

a sponsor for that?

is to enter and do well

and enter
that Pipeline Classic.

contests so much?

01:08:20.863 --> 01:08:24.533
And this is the 15th year
of the Pipeline Classic.

Now, I can see we have here
surfers from Brazil, Peru,

01:08:28.238 --> 01:08:31.841
from Australia, New Zealand,
Japan, the mainland U.S.A.

01:08:31.875 --> 01:08:35.245
and right here
in Hawaii to give us
the biggest field ever.

The 16 amateurs who survive
the elimination heat

01:08:38.682 --> 01:08:42.486
will go into

the top 10 professionals

01:08:42.519 --> 01:08:45.555
for the Miller Lite
$10,000 prize

good luck to all of you
and go for it!

Some of these sponsors
shoot this fashion
video once a year.

01:09:02.738 --> 01:09:06.676
Look like flash dancers,
L.A. kind, huh?

Let's get the clothes
down off the bodies.

Go get her, brah.

lolo all over you.
No. Not my type.

They look all lepo, man.
They're not even surfers.

on Kiani, huh?

It's so beautiful.

01:10:48.545 --> 01:10:49.846
It's my home.

01:10:53.583 --> 01:10:57.454
So I guess
you're staying, huh?
Staying?

01:10:57.487 --> 01:11:00.357
Yeah, you're getting
everything you worked
so hard for.

01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:04.794
Entering the contest,
a chance to go pro.
I don't know.

01:11:04.828 --> 01:11:07.931
Maybe Chandler's right.
Maybe I should take
that scholarship.

01:11:07.964 --> 01:11:08.998
And go to New York?

01:11:10.734 --> 01:11:13.337
I... I... I thought this
was everything you wanted.

01:11:13.370 --> 01:11:18.041
Well, it was.
When I first got here,
more than anything.

01:11:21.578 --> 01:11:22.812
And now?

01:11:47.103 --> 01:11:50.807
JOE: This classic
features the world's best
pros. The extreme power

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:55.979
of a 15-foot wave at pipeline
is measurable as a weight
of over 100,000 pounds

01:11:56.012 --> 01:12:00.049
per cubic foot of
falling lift as it cracks
the face of the wave.

01:12:00.083 --> 01:12:03.487
CORKY: A day like
today, Joe, that reef
could claim a lot of skin,

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:05.321
maybe even a few
broken bones.

01:12:07.624 --> 01:12:10.860
Oh! What a wipeout
for Chuck Downing!

01:12:10.894 --> 01:12:13.630
The first wipeout
of the contest.

01:12:13.663 --> 01:12:17.033
JOE: Corky Carroll,
we're underway with the
next heat of competition.

01:12:17.066 --> 01:12:20.069
We got 20 minutes to go.
In the pit of the pipeline,

01:12:20.103 --> 01:12:21.905
we've got Hawaii's
Mickey Nielsen.

01:12:21.938 --> 01:12:24.474
And he's a front-sider,
or a goofy-footer.

01:12:24.508 --> 01:12:26.443
CORKY: Mickey's dropping
into a very steep wave.

01:12:26.476 --> 01:12:30.580
It's an advantage to have your
right foot forward at pipeline
because you face the wave.

01:12:30.614 --> 01:12:33.116
It's an excellent ride
here for Mickey.
Good points.

01:12:36.119 --> 01:12:38.588
JOE: Next up,
Davey Miller
with a late takeoff.

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:44.428
Broken board.
Bummer.

01:12:44.461 --> 01:12:47.831
Corky, this pipeline
classic is turning into
a hot water action.

01:12:47.864 --> 01:12:50.800
The surfers, look at 'em.
They're traversing left,
traversing right.

01:12:50.834 --> 01:12:55.405
They're climbing up and down
vertically. They're ripping
the waves apart.

01:12:55.439 --> 01:12:58.708
Next up, Christian
"the kid" Fletcher.
There he goes.

01:12:58.742 --> 01:13:02.579
Corky, he's way down the line.
He's deep in the pit.
It's a late takeoff.

01:13:02.612 --> 01:13:04.981
CORKY: Oh, my God,
he's getting pinched and
sucked over the falls!

01:13:05.014 --> 01:13:06.983
A terrible wipeout!

01:13:15.091 --> 01:13:18.762
(CHATTERING)

01:13:18.795 --> 01:13:21.765
CORKY: Well, it's
a good thing the Hui's
out here to make this rescue.

01:13:21.798 --> 01:13:25.001
Hey, mate,
up next, eh?
Mmm-hmm.

01:13:25.034 --> 01:13:27.871
Good luck. A bit
nervous or what?
I am a bit.

01:13:27.904 --> 01:13:29.806
Calling now for
the fourth heat.

01:13:29.839 --> 01:13:32.976
In the fourth heat we have
Fuji Sugihama from Japan.

01:13:33.009 --> 01:13:36.913
Hailing from Hawaii is
Michael Latz. Scott Daly
is from California.

01:13:36.946 --> 01:13:40.750
And from... Arizona?
Arizona?

01:13:40.784 --> 01:13:44.153
Yes, Arizona, Rick Kane.
Okay, gentlemen,
you now have

01:13:44.187 --> 01:13:46.690
20 minutes to catch
a minimum four waves.

01:13:46.723 --> 01:13:49.926
Good luck here at
the dangerous Banzai Pipeline.
Let's give 'em a hand.

01:13:57.133 --> 01:13:58.768
CORKY: They're heading out.

01:13:58.802 --> 01:14:02.205
In the next 20 minutes,
they'll be judged on
three things, Joe.

01:14:02.238 --> 01:14:04.941
Number of waves they catch,
the length of their rides,

01:14:04.974 --> 01:14:07.143
and the sheer radicalness
of their maneuvers.

01:14:07.176 --> 01:14:09.846
JOE: Paddling out as
water patrol and referee

01:14:09.879 --> 01:14:13.483
is the legendary
Vince Moaloka.

(ROCK PLAYING INDISTINCTLY)

01:14:24.227 --> 01:14:27.864
CORKY: Next up is Rick Kane.

01:14:27.897 --> 01:14:32.869
He's flying off the lip
right now, down into the power
zone, nice bottom turn.

01:14:32.902 --> 01:14:36.973
Comes screaming out on the
shoulder. Wow, he's stoked.
Not bad for a new kid.

01:14:37.006 --> 01:14:40.944
It's Scott Daly up next. He's
all the way from California.
He's lookin' good so far.

01:14:46.783 --> 01:14:48.552
Much like a lot
of the Californians do,

01:14:48.585 --> 01:14:49.953
not a big wave
but a good score.

01:14:54.223 --> 01:14:57.561
JOE: Kane scoring big
with the judges on that
excellent bottom turn.

01:14:57.594 --> 01:15:00.029
He pushed the limits.
He didn't hold anything back.

01:15:00.063 --> 01:15:02.999
He made the turn
and flew off the top.

01:15:03.032 --> 01:15:06.836
(AIR HORN BLARING)

01:15:12.642 --> 01:15:17.046
JOE: Corky, the pipeline
classic continues now
in heat six of round two.

01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:20.984
First up is Rick Kane
showing surprising skill
for a newcomer.

01:15:36.966 --> 01:15:40.704
Excuse me.
JOE: Up and riding is
Arizona's Rick Kane in pink.

01:15:40.737 --> 01:15:43.773
He's not a flashy surfer,
Corky, but he's sure got
a real nose for waves.

01:15:50.079 --> 01:15:52.982
Can I borrow those, please?
CORKY: Wow,
an excellent ride!

01:15:53.016 --> 01:15:56.285
He's got amazing control
of his board. Riding all
the way into the beach.

01:15:56.319 --> 01:16:01.057
A few last turns there
as he hits the sand.
Whoo! (LAUGHS)

JOE: The heat is over.
The results are in,

01:16:05.094 --> 01:16:08.665
showing Hawaii's Aaron
Napoleon in first place.
Congratulations, Aaron.

01:16:08.698 --> 01:16:12.836
And Arizona's Rick Kane
is in second...
Oh, you were rippin', Rick.

the final elimination heats.

One more win, guys, and we'll
see you in the main event.

from a wave tank in Arizona.

down to the final moments
of this heated competition.

01:16:52.275 --> 01:16:55.311
Once again, it's Rick Kane
spotting the set.

01:16:55.344 --> 01:16:57.981
CORKY: He's right in
the right place at
the right time once again.

01:16:58.014 --> 01:17:01.117
He's pulling up into
the pocket getting
covered by the barrel.

Remember, the top
two finishers advance
on to the next heat.

he's gonna have to
challenge Lance Burkhart.

that last heated competition.

First place going to the
north shore's own Mark Foo.
Good ride, man.

01:17:46.129 --> 01:17:50.099

for second good enough to get
into the main event.

01:17:53.002 --> 01:17:57.173

see him at a contest.

you could come with me.

just stopped coming with two

Two surfers desperately
need one wave.

01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:53.809
I wonder what's going through
their minds right now.

01:26:53.842 --> 01:26:57.280
Shit! damn it!
Thirty seconds, Lance.

01:26:57.913 --> 01:26:59.382
(GROANS)

01:27:02.017 --> 01:27:04.287
Nice surfing with you guys.

01:27:05.488 --> 01:27:07.690
See ya on the beach.

01:27:07.723 --> 01:27:08.957
LANCE: Shit!

01:27:12.561 --> 01:27:15.764
What are you grinnin' at?
You.

01:27:16.665 --> 01:27:18.934
We're about
to be eliminated.

01:27:18.967 --> 01:27:21.570
I never thought
I'd get this far.
Shit!

01:27:22.371 --> 01:27:23.872
I need this win!

01:27:33.949 --> 01:27:35.451
Rick, turn around.

01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:48.764
CORKY: They're charging
for the same wave, but
Kane has the inside track.

01:27:50.433 --> 01:27:52.301
(CAMERA SHUTTER SNAPPING)

01:27:53.736 --> 01:27:56.071
Burkhart, get your own
damn wave!

01:27:56.104 --> 01:27:58.807
I got it, Burkhart.
Back off, worm.

01:27:58.841 --> 01:28:00.042
I got it!

01:28:05.748 --> 01:28:07.850
(CAMERA SHUTTER SNAPPING)

01:28:09.585 --> 01:28:11.620
Burkhart, you bastard!

01:28:13.422 --> 01:28:15.824
JOE: Burkhart catches
the ride he needed
before the horn.

01:28:15.858 --> 01:28:18.994
You can't get away with this!

01:28:19.027 --> 01:28:21.930
Corky, can you tell us what
happened to Kane out there?

01:28:21.964 --> 01:28:26.402
Geez, I don't know. He started
to get up. He looked like
he caught an edge. It's weird.

01:28:26.435 --> 01:28:31.540
What a terrific performance
anyway, by Arizona's Rick Kane
in his first surfing contest.

01:28:31.574 --> 01:28:34.777
Hey, Burkhart, you son
of a bitch. I saw it!
You pulled his leash.

01:28:34.810 --> 01:28:38.013
BURKHART: You're crazy.
Vince, you saw it, right?

01:28:40.549 --> 01:28:42.418
Come on, Rick,
we're filing a protest.
Wait.

01:28:44.052 --> 01:28:47.490
Why?
What do you mean, why?
He pulled your leash.

01:28:47.523 --> 01:28:48.991
It was your wave.
He deliberately
caused you to fall.

01:28:49.024 --> 01:28:51.394
Chandler. Chandler.

01:28:51.427 --> 01:28:54.830
It's only a contest.
It doesn't mean anything,
right?

01:28:56.499 --> 01:28:58.033
Not to us soul surfers.

01:29:03.606 --> 01:29:06.375
Burkhart.

01:29:06.409 --> 01:29:08.343
You and I know who really
won out there, don't we?

01:29:09.445 --> 01:29:10.112
Idiots.

01:29:12.515 --> 01:29:14.883
Hey, Alex.
Carry your own
damn board!

01:29:16.785 --> 01:29:19.888
Burkhart, wanna buy
some photos?

01:29:25.428 --> 01:29:26.762
Haole boy.

01:29:30.533 --> 01:29:32.868
(CROWD CHEERING)

01:29:36.972 --> 01:29:40.709
RICK: Thanks for taking
me to the airport.
CHANDLER: No problem.

01:29:40.743 --> 01:29:44.379
You say good bye to Kiani?
I'm afraid she said good bye
to me this morning.

01:29:50.453 --> 01:29:55.057
(LAUGHS)
A lei, Chandler?
Isn't this a little bit corny?

01:29:55.090 --> 01:29:57.626
Hey, gimme a break, will ya?
It's from Anela.

01:29:57.660 --> 01:29:59.562
She made me promise.

01:30:00.829 --> 01:30:01.964
Here.

01:30:06.068 --> 01:30:10.839
This is from me.
Chandler, I... I can't use
this where I'm goin'.

01:30:10.873 --> 01:30:14.577
Well, keep it
as a souvenir.
Thank you.

01:30:16.812 --> 01:30:18.781
So, um...
You gonna come in?

01:30:19.848 --> 01:30:22.918
(SIGHS)
No.

01:30:22.951 --> 01:30:24.820
I'm gonna go shape.

01:30:39.635 --> 01:30:42.471
Can I help you, sir?
Oh, yeah, great.

01:30:45.708 --> 01:30:47.776
How's it?
Turtle!

01:30:47.810 --> 01:30:51.179
What's happening?
Oh, I got this chick,
so hot, unreal kind,

01:30:51.213 --> 01:30:52.748
she wants to meet you, brah.

01:30:52.781 --> 01:30:55.083
Turtle, I'm leaving.
Hey, try a look.

01:31:12.067 --> 01:31:14.937
I went back up into
the hills this morning,

01:31:14.970 --> 01:31:16.939
and I wrapped a lava
rock in a tea leaf.

01:31:18.140 --> 01:31:21.009
I made a wish.
What did you wish for?

01:31:23.311 --> 01:31:24.513
That you would come back.

01:31:28.717 --> 01:31:31.720
You come back to
the north shore, okay?

01:31:50.005 --> 01:31:52.274
Check it out.
They caught Burkhart
looking bad.

01:31:53.308 --> 01:31:55.010
Burkhart cheats.

01:31:55.043 --> 01:31:57.946
(BOTH LAUGH)

01:31:57.980 --> 01:32:01.784
RICK: Thanks, Turtle.
Boarding pass. Thank you.

01:32:01.817 --> 01:32:04.587
So long.

01:32:04.620 --> 01:32:07.756
(SPEAKING SURF LINGO)
(LAUGHS)

01:32:08.190 --> 01:32:09.524
Rick.

01:32:10.025 --> 01:32:11.727
So long, Turtle.

01:32:17.900 --> 01:32:21.103
Hey...
I'll be back.

01:32:24.773 --> 01:32:31.747
* Where is the warm someone
who's happy to give

01:32:31.780 --> 01:32:36.985
* I've been up here

01:32:38.787 --> 01:32:43.626
* It's where you belong
With someone who's

01:32:43.659 --> 01:32:45.928
* Happy to give

01:32:45.961 --> 01:32:49.231
* Happy to give you love

01:32:52.267 --> 01:32:55.170
* In the heat of the winter

01:32:55.203 --> 01:32:58.073
* The storm is past

01:32:58.106 --> 01:33:01.944
* It's time
to go out and play

01:33:04.046 --> 01:33:07.015
* Get on an airplane

01:33:07.049 --> 01:33:10.185
* Step on the gas

01:33:10.218 --> 01:33:15.624
* You've got to get there
Get there any way you can

01:33:15.658 --> 01:33:18.661
* Feel the thunder

01:33:18.694 --> 01:33:21.263
* Feel the heat

01:33:21.296 --> 01:33:24.767
* Letting the water
flow over you

01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:26.935
* It's gonna get you through

01:33:26.969 --> 01:33:29.905
* With knowledge and respect

01:33:29.938 --> 01:33:33.041
* In mother nature's hands

01:33:33.075 --> 01:33:37.980
* You're gonna understand
the power in raging heat

01:33:38.013 --> 01:33:43.385
* To hear the
north shore roar

01:33:44.452 --> 01:33:49.658
* Don't let go of the dream

01:33:49.692 --> 01:33:55.931
* To make
the north shore score

01:33:55.964 --> 01:34:02.070
* Just say hello
to your dreams

01:34:02.104 --> 01:34:05.674
* It can be fast
Or it can go so slow

01:34:06.875 --> 01:34:09.912
* Just hang on

01:34:09.945 --> 01:34:12.314
* To what you know

01:34:13.381 --> 01:34:16.184
* You gotta be loose

01:34:16.218 --> 01:34:19.454
* Control the flow

01:34:19.487 --> 01:34:24.860
* Give it, give it
Give it everything you got

01:34:24.893 --> 01:34:29.832
* So trust yourself
It's the only way to go

01:34:29.865 --> 01:34:36.004
* Open up to the feeling
And just let yourself go

01:34:36.038 --> 01:34:39.742
* Become one with the power

01:34:39.775 --> 01:34:42.711
* To shape the world
you're making

01:34:42.745 --> 01:34:45.180
* Living your tomorrows
on the north shore

01:34:45.213 --> 01:34:48.316
* It's all there
for the taking

01:34:48.350 --> 01:34:53.055
* The north shore roar

01:34:54.422 --> 01:34:59.127
* Don't let go of the dream

01:34:59.161 --> 01:35:05.333
* To make
the north shore score

01:35:05.367 --> 01:35:11.006
* And say hello
to your dreams

01:35:11.039 --> 01:35:13.809
* On the north shore

01:35:20.082 --> 01:35:24.452
* North shore roar

01:35:26.521 --> 01:35:29.825
* Don't let go
Don't let go

* North shore score

01:35:43.205 --> 01:35:48.076
* North shore roar

01:35:49.544 --> 01:35:54.850

Don't let go
