28:28.572 --> 28:32.717
I'm Dr. Joseph Heiter.

28:32.718 --> 28:33.997
Japanese

28:33.998 --> 28:43.089
Retired but still very well known as 
the leading surgeon separating siamese twins.

28:43.090 --> 28:47.590
Japanese

28:47.591 --> 28:49.227
Six months,

28:49.228 --> 28:53.641
I designed a never seen operation,
not separating anymore... 

28:53.642 --> 28:55.052
but creating.

28:55.053 --> 28:59.553
I transformed my three Rottweiler

28:58.553 --> 29:04.399
into a beautiful three hound construction.

29:04.400 --> 29:05.818
Good news!

29:06.953 --> 29:08.947
Your tissues match.

29:09.177 --> 29:10.182
So ...

29:10.666 --> 29:17.285
I will explain this spectacular operation
once.

29:17.973 --> 29:19.970
We start ...

29:20.730 --> 29:24.642
 with cutting the ligament patelar.

29:24.988 --> 29:27.481
 The ligaments of the knee caps.

29:28.011 --> 29:31.329
So knee extension...

29:32.200 --> 29:34.455
is no longer possible.

29:35.171 --> 29:37.705
Pulling from "B" and "C"

29:37.706 --> 29:43.057
The central incisors,
and lateral incisors and Canines.

29:43.058 --> 29:44.558
from the upper and lower jaws...

29:48.176 --> 29:51.186
The lips from"B" and "C"...

29:51.632 --> 29:55.180
and the anus of "A" and "B"...

29:55.951 --> 30:02.505
are cut circular along the boarder
between buttock and rectum.

30:03.436 --> 30:07.541
The mucus retains so.

30:09.028 --> 30:12.573
Two pet acellular grafts
 are prepaired

30:13.453 --> 30:18.008
and lifted from the underlining tissue.

30:23.662 --> 30:25.601
The shape incisions.

30:25.602 --> 30:28.917
Below the chins, of "B" to "C"

30:28.918 --> 30:32.136
up to their cheeks.

30:32.996 --> 30:37.932
Connecting the circular skin parts...

30:37.933 --> 30:40.576
of anus and mouth.

30:40.577 --> 30:44.661
From "A" to "B"
and  "B" to "C".

30:44.662 --> 30:46.662
Connecting...

30:46.663 --> 30:52.063
the pet acellular grafts
to the chin/cheek incisions  .

30:58.030 --> 30:59.040
Creating ...

31:00.410 --> 31:03.299
a siamese triplet...

31:03.300 --> 31:04.751
connected

31:05.062 --> 31:07.894
by the gastrict system.

31:08.435 --> 31:11.646
Ingestion by "A"

31:12.475 --> 31:15.882
past through "B"

31:16.950 --> 31:20.821
and excretion by "C".

31:25.091 --> 31:28.018
A human centipede.

31:29.147 --> 31:31.753
First sequence.

31:43.745 --> 31:45.650
Here's your breakfast.

31:45.651 --> 31:48.086
Japanese

31:48.087 --> 31:50.488
general anesthesia.

32:24.511 --> 32:26.010
Lindsay!

32:26.011 --> 32:27.129
Jenny ...

32:45.567 --> 32:48.225
I want my mom!

33:03.262 --> 33:08.166

33:14.533 --> 33:15.867

<i>Open up!</i>

34:01.125 --> 34:02.518

34:10.922 --> 34:13.993
Need help!
You're a sick man!

34:14.652 --> 34:17.712
I am a sick man.

34:17.713 --> 34:19.213
<i>HAHAHAHAHA!</i>

34:20.670 --> 34:24.231
If you do not open immediately I will....

34:25.617 --> 34:27.833
cut your knees

34:27.835 --> 34:32.330
<i>and pull your teeth out
one by one!</i>

34:32.331 --> 34:34.400
<i>without anesthesia.</i>

34:34.436 --> 34:36.474
<i>It's your choice!</i>

34:39.420 --> 34:41.690
Open the door!

34:42.983 --> 34:46.447
<i>Open the door!</i>

35:25.978 --> 35:27.483

Let me and Jenny go.

36:33.237 --> 36:34.350
Please.

36:36.094 --> 36:37.976
We'll give you anything.

36:38.912 --> 36:41.191
Anything you want,
just let us go.

36:43.999 --> 36:45.626
Don't worry ...

36:45.627 --> 36:48.181
it's only a tranquilizer 

36:48.953 --> 36:53.423
Keep your head very still.

36:54.354 --> 36:58.349
I don't want to loose one of yout precious eyes.

37:32.589 --> 37:34.380
Just kill me!

37:37.366 --> 37:38.743
Ahhhh.

37:53.121 --> 37:58.079
One of my Rottweilers
tried to flee

37:58.080 --> 38:00.913
just before the operation.

38:00.948 --> 38:03.746
After I caught the dog....

38:03.747 --> 38:06.974
He had to take the middle postion.

38:07.455 --> 38:08.481
in this postion...

38:08.682 --> 38:10.282
the healing pains...

38:10.882 --> 38:14.182
are twice as intense.

38:15.144 --> 38:18.993
Do you already regret your little escape.

38:19.413 --> 38:22.514
In fact I'm thankful for it.

38:23.529 --> 38:28.844
Because now I know definitely,
you are...

38:28.845 --> 38:32.846
the middle piece!

38:33.866 --> 38:37.083
Just kill me now.
I'd rather be dead.

38:37.084 --> 38:40.609
