00:03.264 --> 00:06.484
MAN [over TV]: The truth is,
I'm not your father.

00:06.528 --> 00:08.530
I'm your...[drilling]

00:13.491 --> 00:16.451
The truth is,
I'm not your father.

00:16.494 --> 00:17.887
I'm your...

00:17.930 --> 00:19.932
[drilling]

00:28.115 --> 00:29.681
[drilling]

00:30.682 --> 00:32.423
Hey, Corey!

00:32.467 --> 00:33.772
[drilling stops]

00:33.816 --> 00:35.035
You're supposed to be
protecting the building

00:35.078 --> 00:37.080
from earthquakes,
not causing them.

00:37.124 --> 00:38.255
Sorry.

00:38.299 --> 00:39.822
Can you take a break
while I finish

00:39.865 --> 00:41.128
the trashy reality show

00:41.171 --> 00:43.260
I'm too embarrassed
to tell you the name of?

00:43.304 --> 00:45.654
All right, fellas, you heard
the lady. Take a break.

00:45.697 --> 00:47.090
Oh, hang on.

00:50.224 --> 00:52.139
Okay. Thank you.What's that for?

00:52.182 --> 00:53.923
I have to prove
to the building owner

00:53.966 --> 00:55.446
that this work
is finally happening

00:55.490 --> 00:58.014
'cause I said I'd take care
of it six years ago

00:58.058 --> 01:00.756
and three years ago
and last year.

01:00.799 --> 01:02.932
Hey, while I've got you,

01:02.975 --> 01:05.108
can you get the guy with the RV
out of the alley?

01:05.152 --> 01:06.457
I can't get my truck in.

01:06.501 --> 01:08.372
Happy to. Yelling at people's
my favorite sport.

01:10.940 --> 01:12.028
What's that one for?

01:12.072 --> 01:14.074
I want to show youto my friends.

01:20.515 --> 01:22.865
Yo, dumbass!

01:22.908 --> 01:24.258
Move this piece of crap!

01:24.301 --> 01:26.303
Hey.

01:26.347 --> 01:29.698
Oh, great, the dumbass
is my husband.

01:29.741 --> 01:31.439
My buddy Jay loaned us his RV.

01:31.482 --> 01:33.441
Spontaneous vacation,
where do you want to go?

01:34.790 --> 01:36.922
Jay's house, to return it.

01:36.966 --> 01:38.968
â™ª

01:47.281 --> 01:48.238
Hi, Wendy.

01:48.282 --> 01:49.457
Hey, Jill.

01:49.500 --> 01:50.849
Hey.

01:50.893 --> 01:53.374
Hi, Wendy. Hi, Bonnie.

01:53.417 --> 01:55.854
Hello, Jill.

01:55.898 --> 01:58.118
[sighs]
It's only a breakup.

01:58.161 --> 02:01.033
Would you stop talking to me
like Neiman Marcus closed?

02:01.077 --> 02:03.123
We're just worried about you.

02:03.166 --> 02:04.776
Well, I'm fine.

02:04.820 --> 02:05.995
Are you?

02:06.038 --> 02:08.171
[sighs]
Yes.

02:08.215 --> 02:11.174
Look, I cried my eyes out
for the first two days,

02:11.218 --> 02:12.828
but then I emerged
from my sadness cocoon

02:12.871 --> 02:14.917
as the butterfly
you see before you.

02:14.960 --> 02:16.223
I unfriended him on Facebook.

02:16.266 --> 02:17.963
I even boxed up
some of his things

02:18.007 --> 02:20.140
and left them at his place
without setting them on fire.

02:20.183 --> 02:22.229
And not just becausehe has a Ring camera,

02:22.272 --> 02:25.319
but because I am a happy,well-adjusted butterfly.

02:26.276 --> 02:27.190
Are you?

02:27.234 --> 02:29.192
Yes.

02:29.236 --> 02:30.411
In fact, I'm in
a great mood today

02:30.454 --> 02:32.326
because I get to go see
my dentist.

02:32.369 --> 02:35.198
You know we can't use thehappy gas for a cleaning, right?

02:35.242 --> 02:37.157
Or can we? Can we?

02:39.202 --> 02:41.335
Dr. Mekizian is my happy gas.

02:41.378 --> 02:43.206
I used to be super phobicabout going to the dentist.

02:43.250 --> 02:44.860
It was a really big problem.

02:44.903 --> 02:48.342
I mean, my smile is my third
most attractive attribute.

02:48.385 --> 02:50.431
Unless I'm in Europe,
and then it's my first.

02:51.432 --> 02:53.869
I'm betting he's hot.

02:53.912 --> 02:56.263
No, he's better than hot.

02:56.306 --> 02:58.613
He's comforting.
He's like a teddy bear

02:58.656 --> 03:00.528
or a bowl of spaghetti

03:00.571 --> 03:03.183
or a teddy bear
eating a bowl of spaghetti.

03:03.226 --> 03:06.621
Oh, I just love him
to itty-bitty pieces.

03:06.664 --> 03:08.275
Hey, sorry I'm late,I was entranced

03:08.318 --> 03:10.538
by the amazing RVthat Adam borrowed.

03:10.581 --> 03:14.194
Yeah. Well, I prefer the phrase
"got stuck with."

03:14.237 --> 03:16.326
Tammy, where are the cookies?You said you'd bring them.

03:16.370 --> 03:18.154
I was entranced.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.112
Did you know that there's
a dinner table that transforms

03:20.156 --> 03:22.245
into a bed and then back
into a dinner table?

03:22.289 --> 03:24.247
Well, that should lead
to an exciting game

03:24.291 --> 03:26.728
of Guess the Stain.

03:26.771 --> 03:28.120
You know, I've never been
inside of one of those.

03:28.164 --> 03:29.513
What exactly is the point?

03:29.557 --> 03:30.732
So you can escape to nature

03:30.775 --> 03:33.125
while still destroying
the environment.

03:33.169 --> 03:35.737
Since when did you careabout the environment?

03:35.780 --> 03:38.130
Since Adam asked me to hop
into that rolling dumpster

03:38.174 --> 03:40.089
and drive around for a week.

03:40.132 --> 03:41.133
As someone who's
lived in my car,

03:41.177 --> 03:43.266
that will never feel
like a vacation.

03:43.310 --> 03:45.747
You know, it wouldn't kill you
to give it a try.

03:45.790 --> 03:47.314
You know what, I
will give it a try

03:47.357 --> 03:49.707
and I hope it does kill me
so I can rub it in your face.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.710
Hey, Jill, how you doing?

03:52.754 --> 03:53.972
Careful, she hates sad voice.

03:54.016 --> 03:56.061
Oh, Tammy,
you're so sweet for asking.

04:05.680 --> 04:08.465
Ground control to Jill.

04:11.860 --> 04:13.296
Is that you, Jill?

04:13.340 --> 04:15.559
You got other patients
who get decked out like this?

04:15.603 --> 04:17.474
I do not.

04:17.518 --> 04:19.998
But I'm always impressed by the
things you think of to bring.

04:20.042 --> 04:21.913
The blanket is to keep me
warm and calm,

04:21.957 --> 04:23.350
the mask is 'cause the light
is bright

04:23.393 --> 04:25.656
and the earphones are so
I don't hear the scraping and...

04:25.700 --> 04:28.137
the drilling.The drilling. I know.

04:28.180 --> 04:30.357
But I still think it's 'cause
you don't want to hear my jokes.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.836
Oh.
[laughs]

04:31.880 --> 04:33.273
How you been, kiddo?

04:33.316 --> 04:34.665
Oh, I've been better.

04:34.709 --> 04:36.319
My boyfriend and I
just broke up.

04:36.363 --> 04:39.975
Well, in my professional
opinion, that's his floss.

04:40.018 --> 04:42.456
[laughs]
Thanks.

04:42.499 --> 04:45.241
No, I'm serious.
Who's his dentist?

04:45.285 --> 04:48.244
I make one phone call
and he eats through a straw.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.725
[laughs]
You're the best.

04:50.768 --> 04:52.335
Oh. Now remember,
I make a lot of faces,

04:52.379 --> 04:54.206
but I'm only in pain
if I raise my hand.

04:54.250 --> 04:56.948
Right hand is pain,
left hand is question.

04:56.992 --> 04:58.907
All right, let's get
that dazzling smile

04:58.950 --> 05:00.125
ready for the next guy.

05:00.169 --> 05:01.605
Oh.

05:01.649 --> 05:03.128
Question?

05:03.172 --> 05:05.957
Um, how long do you think
it'll be till I meet him?

05:06.001 --> 05:07.437
[chuckles]

05:09.874 --> 05:12.094
What do you think so far?

05:12.137 --> 05:13.791
Well, we've only been driving
for seven minutes,

05:13.835 --> 05:15.532
and most of that was you
backing out of the alley,

05:15.576 --> 05:18.187
but... yes, good times.

05:18.230 --> 05:19.754
I'm glad you're
giving this a shot.

05:19.797 --> 05:21.190
Yeah, it was all my idea.

05:21.233 --> 05:23.105
No one had to talk me into it.

05:24.193 --> 05:25.368
So where are we headed?

05:25.412 --> 05:28.893
That's the best part.
Anywhere, U.S.A.

05:28.937 --> 05:30.634
I agreed to one night,

05:30.678 --> 05:33.768
so make it Anywhere,
our zip code.

05:33.811 --> 05:35.204
Isn't this great?
Normally when you travel

05:35.247 --> 05:37.249
it's all a hassle till
you get to your destination,

05:37.293 --> 05:42.472
but with an RV, the party
starts when you turn the key.

05:43.865 --> 05:45.083
Cute rhymes don't make it smell

05:45.127 --> 05:48.173
any less like bowling shoes
in here.

05:48.217 --> 05:51.133
Just sit back and
take in the sights.

05:51.176 --> 05:54.005
Home Depot. Target. McDonald's.

05:54.049 --> 05:56.704
I do love the open road.

05:56.747 --> 05:58.314
Hey, do you want
to make popcorn?

05:58.358 --> 05:59.359
While we're driving?

05:59.402 --> 06:00.534
That's the magic

06:00.577 --> 06:02.362
of the mobile home.

06:02.405 --> 06:04.102
You can watch TV,
play a board game,

06:04.146 --> 06:05.321
iron a shirt.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.801
You can use the toilet,
which, by the way,

06:06.844 --> 06:08.237
turns into a shower.

06:08.280 --> 06:09.586
You can take a shower.

06:09.630 --> 06:11.632
These are all things
we can do at home.

06:11.675 --> 06:14.156
Yeah, but when you're done,
you're still at home.

06:14.199 --> 06:16.158
Here, by the time you dry off,
we're eight, ten miles away.

06:16.201 --> 06:17.855
[chuckles]
You're cute

06:17.899 --> 06:20.380
when you're filled
with inexplicable enthusiasm.

06:23.861 --> 06:25.994
Lorena, can I please
get a purple toothbrush?

06:26.037 --> 06:28.083
And maybe some mint floss?

06:28.126 --> 06:30.259
Cinnamon gives me
the heebie-jeebies.

06:30.302 --> 06:31.695
Thank you.

06:31.739 --> 06:34.002
Hmm. Y'all doing
some remodeling?

06:34.045 --> 06:36.483
That's good, 'cause I was
gonna say something.

06:36.526 --> 06:39.486
The new dentist just wants
to open up the space a little.

06:39.529 --> 06:41.313
Oh, is Dr. Mekizian
getting a partner?

06:41.357 --> 06:43.838
No, the new guy's
taking over the practice.

06:44.882 --> 06:46.493
Uh, where's Dr. Mekizian going?

06:46.536 --> 06:49.104
I'm not supposed
to say anything.

06:49.147 --> 06:51.672
Okay, well, it's too late.

06:51.715 --> 06:53.500
He's retiring.

06:53.543 --> 06:57.373
Like, he's not gonna be seeing
patients anymore?

06:57.417 --> 06:59.375
Am-am I one of the patients

06:59.419 --> 07:01.029
he's not gonna
be seeing anymore?

07:01.072 --> 07:02.509
It's not for three months.

07:02.552 --> 07:04.119
But I only come
every six months.

07:04.162 --> 07:05.337
You know that, Lorena!

07:05.381 --> 07:06.600
I mean,

07:06.643 --> 07:08.166
I have waited for a dentist
I could love

07:08.210 --> 07:11.126
my entire life
and now-now he's abandoning me?

07:11.169 --> 07:12.649
I'm sorry, I don't mean
to be taking it out on you,

07:12.693 --> 07:15.347
it's just, I get excited
when I see those postcards.

07:15.391 --> 07:17.349
I look forward to coming here.

07:17.393 --> 07:19.917
And I just can't believe
that was my last

07:19.961 --> 07:21.441
"How you been, kiddo?"

07:22.485 --> 07:23.530
What's going on?

07:23.573 --> 07:25.706
You are not allowed to retire.

07:25.749 --> 07:28.186
You make me feel safe.

07:28.230 --> 07:29.840
[crying]

07:29.884 --> 07:32.016
And I don't think
I've ever told you this,

07:32.060 --> 07:34.584
but I've put you
as my emergency contact

07:34.628 --> 07:37.848
in every doctor's office,
including this one.

07:39.284 --> 07:40.677
Jill...

07:40.721 --> 07:43.463
I'm sorry.
I was gonna send a letter.

07:43.506 --> 07:45.639
A letter?
Why don't you just send a text

07:45.682 --> 07:48.206
saying, "Your cavities
are no longer my problem"?

07:48.250 --> 07:50.600
This isn't how I wanted you
to find out.

07:52.210 --> 07:54.343
It's time for me to hang it up.

07:54.386 --> 07:56.258
My wife and I want to travel.

07:56.301 --> 07:59.566
Well, can I come with you?

08:02.656 --> 08:05.093
You outdid yourself
with those steaks.

08:05.136 --> 08:07.356
D-3.

08:07.399 --> 08:08.879
Thank you.
Hit.

08:11.273 --> 08:12.230
E-4.

08:12.274 --> 08:15.320
Miss. D-2.

08:15.364 --> 08:17.497
Hit.
You know, the kid on this box

08:17.540 --> 08:20.891
is probably older
than us right now.

08:20.935 --> 08:22.458
B-6.

08:22.502 --> 08:25.243
Miss.
I'm guessing he's dead.

08:25.287 --> 08:27.507
I mean, child model?
What good could come from that?

08:29.509 --> 08:30.858
D-5.

08:30.901 --> 08:33.600
Hit. You sunk my battleship![laughs]

08:33.643 --> 08:35.384
How are you killing me
at this game?

08:35.427 --> 08:37.429
I was born
with a strategic mind.

08:37.473 --> 08:39.257
Also, I can see
all of your boats

08:39.301 --> 08:40.998
in that gigantic
side-view mirror.

08:44.306 --> 08:46.177
I'm craving s'mores
all of a sudden.

08:46.221 --> 08:48.789
Yes, I knew that would happen.

08:48.832 --> 08:50.442
Look what I brought.

08:50.486 --> 08:51.487
You didn't.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.881
I did.
And...

08:53.924 --> 08:55.360
a book of ghost stories.

08:55.404 --> 08:56.492
Scary or sexy?

08:56.536 --> 08:58.276
I've never heard
a sexy ghost story.

08:58.320 --> 08:59.800
We traced the call.

08:59.843 --> 09:02.672
[whispers]: It's coming
from inside your pants.

09:04.761 --> 09:06.241
You were right.

09:06.284 --> 09:08.635
Everything isbetter in an RV.

09:10.245 --> 09:11.638
Told you.[laughs]

09:13.640 --> 09:16.077
You got marshmallow in my hair.

09:16.120 --> 09:19.080
Huh. We could take
a toilet-shower together.

09:19.123 --> 09:20.472
Not something
I ever thought I'd say,

09:20.516 --> 09:22.083
but I'm looking forward to it.

09:22.126 --> 09:23.040
[banging on door]

09:23.084 --> 09:25.260
MAN:
Police, open up.

09:25.303 --> 09:27.567
Ten bucks he thinks
we're cooking meth in here.

09:28.611 --> 09:31.222
Not a bad Plan B, by the way.

09:32.136 --> 09:33.921
Evening, officer.

09:33.964 --> 09:36.053
This is private property.
You can't park your RV here.

09:36.097 --> 09:38.926
Okay, tell that to the guy
sleeping in the table,

09:38.969 --> 09:40.667
'cause he said when
you're in one of these things,

09:40.710 --> 09:42.494
the world is your hotel room.

09:47.195 --> 09:50.372
Look at me, driving home
in my sex sheet.

09:50.415 --> 09:52.766
'Cause I'm in my bedroom,
living room and car

09:52.809 --> 09:55.072
all at the same time.

09:55.116 --> 09:56.465
I can't believe we got a ticket

09:56.508 --> 09:57.945
and you're still
in a great mood.

09:57.988 --> 10:01.470
We made the RV sexy,
but the cop made it dangerous.

10:01.513 --> 10:02.906
I take back every bad word

10:02.950 --> 10:05.300
I said about this thing.You mean that?

10:05.343 --> 10:07.519
I do.
I'm really enjoying this.

10:07.563 --> 10:10.348
Glad to hear it,
'cause we own this bad boy.

10:10.392 --> 10:14.222
What?I-I bought the RV.

10:14.265 --> 10:15.615
Uh, you-you dropped your sheet.

10:21.751 --> 10:23.753
[grunting, groaning]

10:25.973 --> 10:28.236
Hey! What...
Take it easy back there.

10:28.279 --> 10:30.281
Why? If we break it,
we already bought it.

10:30.325 --> 10:33.241
I mean, you already bought it
without talking to me.

10:36.331 --> 10:37.767
You did that on purpose.

10:37.811 --> 10:39.813
I can't get back to our place
without making a turn.

10:39.856 --> 10:41.641
Well, give me
a little warning next time,

10:41.684 --> 10:43.425
like you didn't
when you bought this thing.

10:43.468 --> 10:45.688
I'm sorry.
What can I say?

10:45.732 --> 10:47.255
You know how hard it is
to find an RV

10:47.298 --> 10:48.996
that's tricked out
for a guy in a wheelchair?

10:49.039 --> 10:51.215
You know how easy it is
to pick up the phone

10:51.259 --> 10:53.304
and say, "Hey, honey,
I'm about to spend..."

10:53.348 --> 10:54.436
Wh-What did this cost?

10:54.479 --> 10:55.698
I got a great deal.

10:55.742 --> 10:57.004
It just won't sound like it.

10:57.047 --> 10:58.962
[scoffs, groans]

11:00.703 --> 11:03.619
May I remind you that ten
minutes ago you were Team RV?

11:03.663 --> 11:06.796
Right turn.[yelps, screams]

11:06.840 --> 11:08.450
You know what?

11:08.493 --> 11:10.626
I changed my mind.[brakes squealing]

11:10.670 --> 11:14.238
I'm glad you bought this thing,
'cause now you live in it.

11:22.290 --> 11:24.422
Well...
[sighs]

11:24.466 --> 11:26.424
Well, we knew it would
come to this one day.

11:26.468 --> 11:28.296
Who do you want to live with?

11:30.777 --> 11:33.083
Traitor.

11:33.127 --> 11:35.129
â™ª

11:36.304 --> 11:39.307
How do I move on
from Dr. Mekizian?

11:39.350 --> 11:42.005
I mean, he accepted me
for who I am:

11:42.049 --> 11:44.660
a woman who requires
a blanket, an eye mask

11:44.704 --> 11:47.315
and incense
for a routine checkup.

11:47.358 --> 11:50.753
Are you sure he's retiring
and not just hiding from you?

11:50.797 --> 11:54.801
Are you sure Victor's dead
and not just hiding from you?

11:54.844 --> 11:56.411
Yes.

11:56.454 --> 11:59.327
Hey, is Bonnie coming back,
or is her pickle in play?

12:03.592 --> 12:05.812
Take her pickle
at your own risk.

12:05.855 --> 12:08.336
That's what they used to say
to me in prison.

12:08.379 --> 12:10.817
Guys, I think
I'm gonna kill someone.

12:10.860 --> 12:13.820
I was just making sure
they gave you a crispy one.

12:13.863 --> 12:16.344
Unbelievable.
Adam bought that RV,

12:16.387 --> 12:18.085
and now our insurance
is going up

12:18.128 --> 12:19.651
and we have to
pay to park it.

12:19.695 --> 12:21.523
There's a parking lot
right next to the hospital

12:21.566 --> 12:23.438
that has really good
monthly rates.

12:23.481 --> 12:24.787
I'm enjoying being
in the right.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.397
Please don't give
me solutions.

12:26.441 --> 12:27.747
Adam's my buddy,

12:27.790 --> 12:29.618
but he really screwed the pooch
with this one.

12:29.661 --> 12:31.098
You see, Wendy?
That's what you do.

12:31.141 --> 12:32.186
You feed the fire.

12:33.709 --> 12:35.145
Isn't this the same
exact thing he did

12:35.189 --> 12:36.233
when he bought the bar?

12:36.277 --> 12:37.539
Why, yes, it is, Jill.

12:37.582 --> 12:39.410
I was just reminding him
of that on the phone.

12:39.454 --> 12:41.238
Again, this is what
I'm looking for.

12:42.544 --> 12:44.764
Careful, Bonnie. Sometimes,
when we're in the right

12:44.807 --> 12:47.288
and we handle it poorly,
we're not in the right anymore.

12:47.331 --> 12:50.160
And here's Old Mother Hubbard
to take a whiz on my flames.

12:51.945 --> 12:54.382
I'm just saying
that justified anger

12:54.425 --> 12:57.472
can be dangerous, because
we often take it too far.

12:57.515 --> 12:58.908
Are you even listening to me?

12:58.952 --> 13:00.431
Sorry, I'm just seeing
if the insurance

13:00.475 --> 13:03.565
would cover us if the RV
accidentally caught fire.

13:06.176 --> 13:09.049
What? Adam
wouldn't be in it.

13:12.226 --> 13:14.141
I'm going to the grocery store.

13:14.184 --> 13:16.839
Could you please, uh,
move your house?

13:16.883 --> 13:18.275
Not a problem.

13:18.319 --> 13:19.842
While you're there,
can you grab me some eggs?

13:19.886 --> 13:21.757
Nope.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.672
Are we ever gonna
talk about this?

13:23.715 --> 13:24.891
Nope.

13:24.934 --> 13:26.370
Good day.

13:26.414 --> 13:29.373
So, all we have to do
is to reinforce this area.

13:29.417 --> 13:31.854
And we may have to move
these pipes.

13:31.898 --> 13:35.075
Yes! He's open!
Go, go, go!

13:36.119 --> 13:37.817
Sounds like a good plan, Corey.

13:38.992 --> 13:40.471
What the hell?

13:43.257 --> 13:45.999
4:00, right on time.
Hey, buddy.

13:46.042 --> 13:47.130
You have him till 6:00.

13:47.174 --> 13:48.392
Don't let him fill up on treats,

13:48.436 --> 13:49.654
'cause he's having dinner
with me.

13:49.698 --> 13:52.005
You're not handling this well.

13:52.048 --> 13:53.528
I know.

13:56.009 --> 13:57.227
What if I give you money?

13:58.272 --> 13:59.882
Jill.

13:59.926 --> 14:02.232
Not like a gift.
Like an investment.

14:02.276 --> 14:04.800
A cash infusion,
they call it on CNBC.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.498
It's not about the money.

14:07.542 --> 14:09.283
What if we just
meet up twice a year?

14:09.326 --> 14:11.938
There must be a dentist office
you can rent by the hour.

14:11.981 --> 14:14.331
I don't think that'd be fair
to my other patients.

14:14.375 --> 14:17.030
Fine. What if I have you over
for dinner every six months,

14:17.073 --> 14:19.293
and if the conversation
leads us to a room in my house

14:19.336 --> 14:21.599
that has a dental chair,
whatever happens happens.

14:21.643 --> 14:23.384
Do you have a dental chair?

14:23.427 --> 14:25.429
Well, I've narrowed it down
to three.

14:25.473 --> 14:28.389
I'll send you a link
to my Amazon cart.

14:28.432 --> 14:31.218
I should have known you weren't
gonna take this news easily.

14:31.261 --> 14:32.828
Yeah, you should have.

14:34.830 --> 14:38.399
I'm sorry it's hard,
but I am retiring.

14:39.443 --> 14:41.271
So you're just gonna

14:41.315 --> 14:43.621
hang up your saliva vacuum
and leave me?

14:43.665 --> 14:47.147
[chuckles] Dr. Segal will be
taking on all of my patients.

14:47.190 --> 14:48.975
You'll be in excellent hands.

14:50.324 --> 14:52.630
So this is it?

14:52.674 --> 14:54.023
It's over?

14:54.067 --> 14:55.938
It is.

14:55.982 --> 14:57.592
Well...

14:57.635 --> 14:59.246
if it's really over...

14:59.289 --> 15:01.422
And it is.

15:01.465 --> 15:04.599
Then I...
I want to say thank you.

15:05.992 --> 15:08.690
I'm gonna try to get
through this without crying.

15:10.300 --> 15:13.390
I know that I can be

15:13.434 --> 15:16.437
a bit needy sometimes.

15:16.480 --> 15:17.960
I guess that's
one of the big reasons

15:18.004 --> 15:19.919
why Andy broke up with me.

15:19.962 --> 15:21.964
But you, um...

15:22.008 --> 15:24.836
you never made me feel
like I was too much.

15:26.229 --> 15:28.710
There.
I made it.

15:28.753 --> 15:31.147
Jill, some people

15:31.191 --> 15:32.932
might call you
high-maintenance.

15:34.629 --> 15:36.065
But I think you're someone

15:36.109 --> 15:38.633
who knows what she wants
and how to ask for it.

15:38.676 --> 15:41.201
Exactly. And then you don't
have to guess what I want,

15:41.244 --> 15:42.985
which actually makes me
low-maintenance.

15:43.029 --> 15:45.118
I wouldn't go that far.

15:45.161 --> 15:47.033
[both chuckling]

15:49.035 --> 15:50.166
I'm gonna miss you.

15:50.210 --> 15:52.342
I'm gonna miss you, too, kiddo.

15:52.386 --> 15:54.083
Can I hug you?

15:55.171 --> 15:58.740
Well, I'm gonna need to call
Lorena in, but...

15:58.783 --> 16:00.176
yes.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.442
[power tools whirring outside]

16:13.015 --> 16:15.235
[loud whirring and grinding]

16:15.278 --> 16:17.280
Damn it, Corey.

16:19.195 --> 16:21.502
Hey, Cor?Yeah?

16:21.545 --> 16:23.330
What's the deal with the water?

16:23.373 --> 16:24.853
I had to shut it off.

16:24.896 --> 16:26.202
Should be back on
by tonight.

16:26.246 --> 16:28.465
Okey doke.
Have a super day.

16:32.078 --> 16:33.993
[knocking]

16:36.082 --> 16:37.126
Good morning.

16:37.170 --> 16:38.693
The water's shut off.

16:38.736 --> 16:41.087
I need coffee and the bathroom.

16:41.130 --> 16:44.264
After punishing me all week,
you're gonna ask for a favor?

16:44.307 --> 16:45.569
It's not a favor.

16:45.613 --> 16:47.615
I own half of this thing,
and I've decided

16:47.658 --> 16:50.357
it's the half with the coffee
and the potty-shower.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.098
And if I say no?

16:52.141 --> 16:53.316
I will have you towed.

16:53.360 --> 16:55.231
Come on in.Good call.

17:02.238 --> 17:03.848
I'm glad you're here.

17:05.285 --> 17:07.156
I really wanted to talk to you.

17:07.200 --> 17:08.592
What'd you buy now?

17:08.636 --> 17:10.072
A boat?
Space shuttle?

17:10.116 --> 17:12.379
Papa John's franchise?

17:12.422 --> 17:14.424
Yeah, I get why
you think I might.

17:14.468 --> 17:15.860
That is a messed-up thing

17:15.904 --> 17:17.340
I seem to do
every now and again,

17:17.384 --> 17:19.125
and I'm very, very sorry.

17:20.169 --> 17:22.563
This coffee is terrible.
Go on.

17:22.606 --> 17:25.261
When I bought the bar
without discussing it with you,

17:25.305 --> 17:27.089
I promised you and myself

17:27.133 --> 17:28.873
that I would never
do anything like that again,

17:28.917 --> 17:30.832
but I did, and...

17:33.574 --> 17:37.230
...it was disrespectful to you
and our marriage.

17:37.273 --> 17:38.709
So why the hell
do you keep doing it?

17:40.059 --> 17:42.931
Well, that part's
a little trickier to talk about.

17:45.455 --> 17:48.023
I feel like...
[sighs]

17:48.067 --> 17:49.242
There are times where...

17:52.288 --> 17:53.985
You know when
two people are in a canoe?

17:54.029 --> 17:55.117
Spit it out!

17:55.161 --> 17:57.206
Sometimes,
when I want something,

17:57.250 --> 17:58.990
I-I'm afraid to run it by you

17:59.034 --> 18:01.123
because you'll just
shoot it down.

18:01.167 --> 18:02.820
It's just easier
to get what I want

18:02.864 --> 18:04.344
and deal with the fallout later.

18:04.387 --> 18:06.737
Well, that is
manipulative, immature

18:06.781 --> 18:09.131
and probably how
I'd handle me, too.

18:09.175 --> 18:10.524
But in my defense,

18:10.567 --> 18:13.004
we are having an adult
conversation now.

18:13.048 --> 18:14.528
Yeah, but it took seven days.

18:14.571 --> 18:17.270
Meanwhile, I'm living in
an alley, sneaking in the house

18:17.313 --> 18:19.141
in the middle of the night
to get clean underwear.

18:19.185 --> 18:22.188
I knew it. I saw fresh
wheel tracks on the rug.

18:22.231 --> 18:24.973
Look, I know I said this before,
but this time, I mean it.

18:25.016 --> 18:26.931
This will not happen again.

18:26.975 --> 18:28.194
It better not,

18:28.237 --> 18:29.369
because three strikes,
you're out, buddy.

18:30.413 --> 18:31.936
Does that work both ways?

18:33.373 --> 18:36.027
Forget the strikes.
Just don't do it again.

18:36.071 --> 18:37.203
I promise.

18:37.246 --> 18:38.856
And I promise

18:38.900 --> 18:41.120
that if you come to me
with something that you want,

18:41.163 --> 18:42.991
I will hear you out,
even if it's stupid.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.950
Well, I'm a guy.
Everything I want is stupid.

18:47.430 --> 18:50.433
Well, everything except you.

18:57.397 --> 18:59.312
I'm sorry for punishing
you all week.

18:59.355 --> 19:02.053
I guess I just found
it hard to forgive you

19:02.097 --> 19:04.273
for something you'd
already done before.

19:04.317 --> 19:05.883
Isn't that what marriage is--

19:05.927 --> 19:08.103
mistakes, apologies
and what's for dinner?

19:08.147 --> 19:09.539
What is for dinner?

19:09.583 --> 19:11.541
How about we figure outbreakfast first?[chuckles]

19:11.585 --> 19:13.239
I have an idea.

19:13.282 --> 19:15.241
You drive us to Denny's
while I brush my teeth.

19:15.284 --> 19:17.330
And I'm paying 'cause I
snuck in here last night

19:17.373 --> 19:18.679
and stole all your cash.

19:18.722 --> 19:19.723
I knew it!

19:28.515 --> 19:31.344
Mm. Well, this is
a living nightmare.

19:32.954 --> 19:34.390
That was my first reaction, too,

19:34.434 --> 19:36.697
but the longer we have it,
the more I love it.

19:36.740 --> 19:39.308
You just like saying
you have a second home.

19:39.352 --> 19:42.616
I do. It can be a beach house
or a mountain chalet,

19:42.659 --> 19:46.533
as long as the roads leading
to those places are wide enough.

19:46.576 --> 19:48.535
Sorry, I still
don't get it.

19:48.578 --> 19:49.753
Check it out.

19:49.797 --> 19:51.668
Everything in here
turns into something else.

19:51.712 --> 19:52.669
Mm.

19:52.713 --> 19:54.541
Well, unless it turns into

19:54.584 --> 19:56.369
a room at the Four Seasons,
mm-mmm.

19:56.412 --> 20:00.111
I bet at the Four Seasons
the table isn't also a bed.

20:00.155 --> 20:01.722
Hmm.

20:01.765 --> 20:03.419
Ow!

20:03.463 --> 20:05.813
[gasps] Jill!

20:05.856 --> 20:07.641
I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

20:07.684 --> 20:10.034
It's bad, isn't it?

20:10.078 --> 20:11.340
Very bad.

20:11.384 --> 20:14.517
Yes! I get to see my
dentist one last time!

20:14.561 --> 20:15.779
[laughs]
