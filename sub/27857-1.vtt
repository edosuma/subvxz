07:05.383 --> 07:08.176
Did you shoot your parents?

07:26.362 --> 07:28.156
- Where's Annie?

07:28.197 --> 07:30.158
Why isn't she here

07:30.199 --> 07:32.118

07:38.416 --> 07:39.458
with her bullshit right now.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.834
- We have friends
that don't even know

07:40.835 --> 07:42.961
about the funeral service.

07:42.962 --> 07:44.504
- Well, then chop to

07:44.505 --> 07:47.299
Got a couple hours,

Where are you?

What about Annie?

09:20.768 --> 09:22.395
She gets nothing

09:23.938 --> 09:27.066
- She's under the same
provisions that you are.

09:27.358 --> 09:29.360
Roger's been given
stus to oversee

09:29.527 --> 09:31.529
your welfare and Annie's.

09:32.280 --> 09:34.949
- Aren't you gonna say anything?

09:36.158 --> 09:38.703
Do we have to be under
Roger's discretion?

09:39.412 --> 09:41.329
Steven is better
suited for this.

09:41.330 --> 09:44.667
- What are you trying
to say, Laura?

09:45.668 --> 09:48.296
Now, be cool now, you're

this DeLorean place.

15:31.805 --> 15:33.182

I'll be back.

16:41.417 --> 16:43.585
And I won't only kill you.

16:44.753 --> 16:46.963
But I'll kill this
little creature too,

16:46.964 --> 16:50.676

16:51.844 --> 16:54.138
Hey, do you understand?
- Si.

16:59.059 --> 17:00.059
- Ai!

17:05.773 --> 17:06.773
- Hey!

19:52.482 --> 19:53.650
- Who are you?

19:54.610 --> 19:55.610
Why?

20:21.178 --> 20:22.846
You're the daughter?

20:36.193 --> 20:37.193
- What?

20:39.488 --> 20:40.864
What did you say?

20:43.659 --> 20:45.077
Hey you, come on.

20:46.203 --> 20:48.537
- Please don't kill me.

20:48.538 --> 20:51.582
- But how do you know
I'm the daughter?

20:51.583 --> 20:55.003
- Max hired me to
rob your folks.

20:57.589 --> 20:59.715
He said they had a daughter.

20:59.716 --> 21:01.134
- Max, who's Max?

21:02.219 --> 21:03.720
Please don't die, please!

21:03.887 --> 21:05.388
Please don't die on me!

21:05.389 --> 21:07.807
I'll take you to the
hospital, please!

21:07.808 --> 21:09.142
Who's that, Max?

21:10.894 --> 21:14.147
- Max said you weren't
supposed to be there.

21:14.356 --> 21:17.358
We were to just
shake the ace down.

21:17.359 --> 21:19.402
Make it look like a robbery.

21:19.403 --> 21:20.653
- To make it look
like a robbery?

21:20.654 --> 21:22.238
Why?

21:22.239 --> 21:26.284
Why? What other reason were
you supposed to be there for?

21:26.285 --> 21:28.203
Tell me about this Max.

21:29.079 --> 21:31.623
- I only know him as Max Black.

21:33.292 --> 21:36.378
He's just a hired gun.
- A hired gun?

21:37.921 --> 21:39.089
Who hired him?

21:41.258 --> 21:43.342
Who hired him? Please
don't die, please!

21:43.343 --> 21:44.343
- The son.

21:47.097 --> 21:49.182
It's for the inheritance.

21:51.476 --> 21:52.602
- Wake up.

21:53.395 --> 21:54.437
Wake up!

21:54.438 --> 21:55.438
Wake up!

22:11.621 --> 22:12.621
- The son?

22:15.250 --> 22:16.251
Inheritance?

22:18.253 --> 22:19.379
What the hell?

22:21.298 --> 22:22.466
What the hell?

22:26.303 --> 22:27.471
- Who are you?

22:29.139 --> 22:31.808
Hey, hey, there's no money here.

22:36.063 --> 22:37.063
Shit!

22:39.691 --> 22:41.610
You shot me, you bitch!

22:44.488 --> 22:46.239
- You have a lighter?

22:47.783 --> 22:48.783
- What?

22:50.452 --> 22:52.788
- Are you stupid? A lighter.

22:53.705 --> 22:56.166
- No, I don't have a lighter.

22:57.042 --> 22:58.543
Yeah, yeah.

22:58.710 --> 23:00.378
In there.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.338
My secretary smokes.

23:02.339 --> 23:03.839
In her desk.

23:03.840 --> 23:05.800
- That sounds like a good idea.

23:05.801 --> 23:07.385
Now, if you move from there,

23:07.386 --> 23:09.595
then I shoot you again.

23:09.596 --> 23:11.098
Do you understand?

23:11.973 --> 23:13.557
Good.

23:13.558 --> 23:16.228
I'll be back, don't go anywhere.

23:26.822 --> 23:28.990
- You fuckin' crazy bitch!

23:34.371 --> 23:36.498
- I told you, don't move.

23:40.627 --> 23:42.712
- What do you want?

23:45.298 --> 23:48.051
- We're gonna have
a little chat.

23:49.386 --> 23:52.054
We need to talk about
the Arlington's will.

23:52.055 --> 23:53.056
- Arlington?

23:55.100 --> 23:57.726
Annie?
- Shut the fuck up!

23:57.727 --> 23:58.978
Who paid you to change it?

23:58.979 --> 24:02.398
- I dont know what
you're talking about.

24:07.070 --> 24:08.696
It was Roger!

24:08.697 --> 24:10.906
It was a deal with Roger and I!

24:10.907 --> 24:12.032
Dave changed the will,

24:12.033 --> 24:13.742
and left everything to you,

24:13.743 --> 24:15.161
and I dont know how
Roger found out.

24:15.162 --> 24:16.328
He came to me.

24:16.329 --> 24:18.080
- You son of a bitch!

24:18.081 --> 24:21.125
Then you two murdered
my parents?

24:21.126 --> 24:24.086
I had no idea Roger
was gonna kill anybody.

24:24.087 --> 24:25.838
I mean, that's crazy.

24:25.839 --> 24:29.800
I changed the will after Dave
and Martha were already dead.

24:29.801 --> 24:32.636
- Who's Max Black?
How about Bill?

24:32.637 --> 24:34.513
- I dont know.

24:34.514 --> 24:38.017
- And Hector, have you
ever heard of them?

24:38.018 --> 24:39.894
- I dont know'em.

24:41.980 --> 24:44.231
I'm tellin' you the truth.

24:44.232 --> 24:45.774
I dont know 'em.

24:45.775 --> 24:48.110
I dont know any of 'em,
I'm tellin' you the truth!

24:48.111 --> 24:49.945
- And you never will.

24:49.946 --> 24:53.657
Because I took care
of them already.

24:53.658 --> 24:55.367
Was Steven involved?

24:55.368 --> 24:58.829
- I don't think so,
I mean, I dont know.

24:58.830 --> 25:00.789
I was dealing with Roger,

25:00.790 --> 25:03.083
and he never said
Steven was involved.

25:03.084 --> 25:04.585
I dont know.

25:04.586 --> 25:07.297
- So, I guess now
it's your turn.

25:08.632 --> 25:11.133
- No, no, please don't kill me!

25:11.134 --> 25:12.968
No, please, please!

25:12.969 --> 25:14.386
I can fix it!

25:14.387 --> 25:18.224
You need me Annie, I
can't say anything, right?

25:18.225 --> 25:19.768
I would go to jail!

25:23.855 --> 25:25.564
You're robbing me?

25:25.565 --> 25:27.317
This is a donation...

25:29.361 --> 25:33.031
For the Foundation of
Abused Women of Texas.

25:41.081 --> 25:43.332
You call Roger,
and then Max Black,

25:43.333 --> 25:45.001
and you tell them...

25:46.378 --> 25:48.879
Tell them Jezebel is coming.

25:48.880 --> 25:50.714
- Who?

25:50.715 --> 25:53.677
Are you aware you're
a crazy bitch?

26:03.603 --> 26:04.603
I know.

26:09.025 --> 26:12.653
Next time you call
me crazy bitch,

26:12.654 --> 26:14.197
I'm gonna kill you.

27:13.757 --> 27:15.257
- Hey!

27:15.258 --> 27:19.429
Wake up! Get up! Come on.

27:20.972 --> 27:21.972
- Hey.

27:23.600 --> 27:27.686
- I need you to grab all
your stuff and get out.

27:27.687 --> 27:29.897
Because I'm movin' in.
- What?

27:29.898 --> 27:31.398
- Come on now, you heard me.

27:31.399 --> 27:34.109
You don't live here anymore.

27:34.110 --> 27:36.487
- What do you mean?

27:36.488 --> 27:38.615
- This house is mine now.

27:39.949 --> 27:42.118
And I don't want you here.

27:45.413 --> 27:47.706
- Are you giving me
money to get my own place

27:47.707 --> 27:50.250
because my cards were cut...
- Money?

27:51.461 --> 27:53.837
You're out of your
freakin' mind.

27:53.838 --> 27:55.006
With the keys.

27:56.299 --> 27:57.966
The keys to the DeLorean.

27:57.967 --> 27:59.219
They over here?

28:00.136 --> 28:01.136
Lisa!

28:03.056 --> 28:06.266
Get all her shit out of the car,

28:06.267 --> 28:08.018
put it in this bag,

28:08.019 --> 28:09.895
and bring it back
when you're done.

28:09.896 --> 28:10.896
- Asshole!

28:12.732 --> 28:14.900
- And where am I supposed to go?

28:14.901 --> 28:17.486
I have no money, my credit
cards were canceled,

28:17.487 --> 28:19.905
you were supposed...
- Get a fuckin' job, Annie!

28:19.906 --> 28:20.906
Okay.

28:21.866 --> 28:23.826
I really don't freakin' care.

28:23.827 --> 28:25.328
Get a fuckin' job.

30:26.574 --> 30:28.534
- I can't take it anymore!

30:28.535 --> 30:32.038
I can't take it!

30:46.886 --> 30:46.928
I'm in Limbo.

30:47.428 --> 30:48.555
I'm in Limbo.

30:50.849 --> 30:55.227
The nightmare I left behind
when they brought me here

30:55.228 --> 30:57.814
has come back to trap me again.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.859
This time it won't let go.

31:03.152 --> 31:04.153
I feel dead.

31:05.321 --> 31:06.321
Empty.

31:10.034 --> 31:12.120
I don't want to be alive.

31:13.288 --> 31:15.456
But I don't wanna be dead.

31:16.666 --> 31:18.166
I don't wanna sleep.

31:18.167 --> 31:20.420
But I don't wanna be awake.

31:22.005 --> 31:23.882
I don't wanna be alone.

31:25.967 --> 31:28.844
But I don't want
anybody with me.

31:28.845 --> 31:31.097
They took everything I had.

31:33.182 --> 31:35.058
Now, I'm back at the orphanage,

31:35.059 --> 31:38.271
and this time, no
one's coming for me.

31:40.523 --> 31:42.108
I'm a walking dead.

33:17.996 --> 33:22.000
- How come you didn't
mention that to us before?

33:23.251 --> 33:27.337
How do I know you didn't just
pick it up out of the park?

33:27.338 --> 33:30.174
- Aren't you gonna check it out?

33:30.216 --> 33:32.759
- I find it very interesti

33:32.760 --> 33:35.137
that you've never
mentioned it before.

33:35.138 --> 33:36.681
- So what?

33:36.764 --> 33:40.350
Hey listen, this
could be a lead, oy!

33:40.351 --> 33:42.185
Why would anyone
living out of town

33:42.186 --> 33:44.981
be running by my house?

33:45.898 --> 33:47.316
Why? Think of it!

33:51.821 --> 33:52.821
- Okay.

34:00.955 --> 34:03.291
If looks could
kill, I'd be dead.

34:35.782 --> 34:38.201
- Hi! How are you?

34:41.411 --> 34:42.411
Come here.

35:05.061 --> 35:06.978
More, come here, closer.

35:06.979 --> 35:08.272
Sit next to me.

35:28.584 --> 35:29.836
This is for me?

35:32.213 --> 35:33.338
Thank you.

35:33.339 --> 35:35.632
You're very sweet.

35:35.633 --> 35:37.009
What's your name?

35:39.137 --> 35:41.973
You don't wanna
tell me your name.

35:43.975 --> 35:45.685
At least you like me,

35:46.811 --> 35:49.813
but you don't wanna
tell me your name?

35:49.814 --> 35:51.149
That's okay.

35:58.239 --> 35:59.490
You can't hear.

36:00.992 --> 36:02.660
And you can't speak.

36:04.662 --> 36:05.662
Whoa.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.250
Well...

36:10.251 --> 36:11.251
Neighbor.

36:13.838 --> 36:15.214
My name is Annie.

36:16.841 --> 36:18.676
I'm your new neighbor.

37:33.542 --> 37:34.542
Jezebel?

37:54.772 --> 37:56.398
- And just tell this guy to just

37:56.399 --> 37:58.692
get out of the car,
you know what I'm sayin'?

38:00.486 --> 38:02.696
- I keep calling you.

38:02.697 --> 38:05.615
You never return my calls.

38:05.616 --> 38:07.951
Have you gone to Houston
to talk to that guy?

38:07.952 --> 38:10.245
- Okay, you listen
to me carefully.

38:10.246 --> 38:13.707
- No, you listen to me,
you haven't done shit!

38:13.708 --> 38:15.625
You are a good for
nothing useless cop,

38:15.626 --> 38:16.793
that's what you are.

38:16.794 --> 38:17.961
If you're not
gonna do anything...

38:17.962 --> 38:21.339
- I'm getting
really tired of you.

38:21.340 --> 38:23.591
Okay, I understand your pain,

38:23.592 --> 38:25.051
but we're doing our
job and you don't...

38:25.052 --> 38:26.344
- Are you gonna
do something about

38:26.345 --> 38:28.848
my parent's murder, yes or no?

38:30.975 --> 38:33.143
Because if you're not,

38:33.144 --> 38:35.812
then I will.

38:35.813 --> 38:37.981
- What are you trying to say?

38:37.982 --> 38:40.900
- And believe me,
you won't like it.

39:10.014 --> 39:11.348
- What are you doin'?

39:11.349 --> 39:13.434
You're hitting my target.

39:32.578 --> 39:34.537
- Okay, are you gonna stand
there and look stupid?

39:34.538 --> 39:35.705
Or are you gonna help me?

39:35.706 --> 39:37.208
- Wow, okay, okay.

39:39.377 --> 39:41.753
Do you see that nine?

39:41.754 --> 39:43.380
You wanna aim right
for that nine.

39:43.381 --> 39:44.631
Shoot for the heart.

39:44.632 --> 39:46.884
Always shoot for the heart.

40:14.662 --> 40:15.662
Like this.

40:34.140 --> 40:35.932
âª Let me give you some advice

40:35.933 --> 40:39.644
âª Here's a little solution

40:39.645 --> 40:42.021
âª Don't be afraid

40:42.022 --> 40:45.943
âª Tomorrow's still another day

40:47.862 --> 40:52.032
âª Do you wanna be
apart of my revolution

40:53.451 --> 40:56.244
âª It's not a game

40:56.245 --> 41:00.498
âª Tell me if you wanna play

41:00.499 --> 41:02.041
âª With the crown

41:02.042 --> 41:03.918
âª I dream in the rain

41:03.919 --> 41:07.297
âª And half the time I go insane

41:07.298 --> 41:11.718
âª And touch the sky and
get as high up as the stars

41:11.719 --> 41:12.969
- Do I have to be like this?

41:12.970 --> 41:15.389
- What? Are you like a ninja?

41:17.183 --> 41:18.516
Squeeze it...

41:18.517 --> 41:20.477
Geez.

41:20.478 --> 41:21.895
Alright, we're
gonna switch sides.

41:21.896 --> 41:24.105
âª When you shoot
you shoot to kill

41:24.106 --> 41:27.984
âª And always aim for the heart

41:32.323 --> 41:33.740
âª And with a crown

41:33.741 --> 41:35.450
âª I dream in the rain

41:35.451 --> 41:38.828
âª And half the time I go insane

41:38.829 --> 41:41.539
âª And touch the sky and
get as high up as the stars

41:41.540 --> 41:42.540
What?

41:45.044 --> 41:47.003
- So, I'm good, my gun.
- You're a natural, yeah.

41:47.004 --> 41:49.130
âª As soon as dark

41:49.131 --> 41:52.717
âª And the one thing that
I learned from the start

41:52.718 --> 41:55.678
âª Is when you shoot
you shoot to kill

41:55.679 --> 41:59.600
âª And always aim for the heart

42:07.358 --> 42:09.318
- You're funny looking.

42:21.872 --> 42:23.707
Always the heart?

42:24.625 --> 42:25.625
- Yes.

42:26.919 --> 42:27.920
It's fast...

42:29.838 --> 42:30.923
And definite.

42:44.186 --> 42:46.396
- I understand your pain,

42:46.397 --> 42:49.899
but we're doing our
job, this is for us.

44:44.515 --> 44:46.766
- I told you not to
call me at this number.

44:46.767 --> 44:48.185
What do you want?

44:49.353 --> 44:52.355
No, and it won't be
taken care of this week.

44:52.356 --> 44:55.109
And don't call
me, I'll call you.

45:13.419 --> 45:15.754
Hey, Jez, how are you?
- Hey.

45:16.797 --> 45:19.382
I got your present, thanks.

45:19.383 --> 45:21.801
- It's untraceable.
- It's what?

45:21.802 --> 45:24.137
What does that mean?

45:24.138 --> 45:26.389
- Don't worry,
it's a good thing.

45:26.390 --> 45:28.057
- How much did it cost you?

45:28.058 --> 45:29.726
- Yeah, don't worry
about that either.

45:29.727 --> 45:31.185
I get a big discount.

45:31.186 --> 45:34.105
- Okay, well, don't
come for me tomorrow.

45:34.106 --> 45:36.524
I won't be here.
- Really?

45:36.525 --> 45:39.736
I thought you wanted to
try out your new toy?

45:39.737 --> 45:41.738
You know, shoot a
little, ride a little.

45:41.739 --> 45:44.615
- No, well, I'll be out of town.

45:44.616 --> 45:46.325
- When you comin' back?

45:46.326 --> 45:48.661
- I dont know yet.

45:48.662 --> 45:50.998
But I'll call you okay, bye.

45:51.874 --> 45:52.875
- Wait, Jez.

48:01.211 --> 48:03.588
Give me a beer.
- What kind?

48:03.589 --> 48:06.425
- I don't give a
shit, a cold one.

48:20.314 --> 48:23.024
- I'll see that last card.

48:37.080 --> 48:40.875
- If you come
I'll give you a tip.

48:40.876 --> 48:42.711
And your phone number.

49:14.326 --> 49:17.787
- Who's the owner of
that bike outside?

49:17.788 --> 49:18.789
- It's mine.

49:33.887 --> 49:35.639
- Are you man enough?

49:42.646 --> 49:44.106
- What's the bet?

49:45.315 --> 49:46.316
- Your bike.

50:16.471 --> 50:17.471
Cards?

50:18.557 --> 50:19.557
- Two.

50:57.679 --> 51:00.973
- You bitch, there
were five aces.

52:44.202 --> 52:46.036
- I want a beer.

52:46.037 --> 52:47.956
Charge it to him, okay.

54:05.075 --> 54:07.577
- So, this is my little place.

54:09.955 --> 54:12.248
- This is one of your pieces?

54:12.249 --> 54:15.502
- Yeah, that's one
of my recent pieces.

54:19.923 --> 54:21.925
- So, where is your art?

54:23.176 --> 54:24.176
- My what?

54:25.178 --> 54:27.054
Yeah, I'm workin'
on a few pieces.

54:27.055 --> 54:27.889
- Where are they?

54:27.890 --> 54:29.807
I wanna see them.

54:29.808 --> 54:32.435
- Later, here, drink your beer.

54:38.400 --> 54:40.944
Let me play some music for ya'.

54:57.794 --> 54:59.211
- What are you doing?

54:59.212 --> 55:01.214
- Relax, it's okay.
- No.

55:02.382 --> 55:03.382
No!

55:04.759 --> 55:05.759
I said no!

55:16.354 --> 55:17.605
I'll take that.

55:18.523 --> 55:19.815
Sorry if I mislead you,

55:19.816 --> 55:21.985
but I have to go okay, so.

55:23.153 --> 55:25.905
- You're not goin'
anywhere, bitch!

58:26.836 --> 58:31.131
- Send Max after before
she finds out the truth.

58:31.132 --> 58:33.509
She's gonna come after you.

58:33.510 --> 58:34.510
Believe me.

58:36.221 --> 58:39.431
Don't mess with her,
she's a bad ass.

58:39.432 --> 58:40.432
Look at me!

58:46.022 --> 58:47.857
There is no other way.

58:49.317 --> 58:51.027
You gotta do her too.

58:52.570 --> 58:53.530
Call up your guy Max,

58:53.531 --> 58:55.865
and have him take care of it.

58:58.201 --> 59:00.954
Man, you should've
seen her eyes.

59:03.206 --> 59:06.209
It was like lookin'
at death itself.

59:10.505 --> 59:12.422
- You don't know
worry about anything.

59:12.423 --> 59:13.758
I've got a plan.

59:24.394 --> 59:25.645
- Hello, Annie.

59:26.729 --> 59:28.565
You haven't called me.

59:39.576 --> 59:42.369
You know, we checked on him.

59:42.370 --> 59:44.580
The wallet you gave us.

59:44.581 --> 59:46.415
- You did?

59:46.416 --> 59:47.834
- Yeah, sure did.

59:50.753 --> 59:54.631
You don't wanna know
what we found out?

59:54.632 --> 59:55.758
We found him.

59:56.926 --> 59:58.260
Except we couldn't get
a statement out of him

59:58.261 --> 01:00:01.264
because he was
riddled with bullets.

01:00:04.434 --> 01:00:06.436
- Let me get this right.

01:00:07.895 --> 01:00:11.356
Was it A, you were looking
for him and found him dead?

01:00:11.357 --> 01:00:14.651
Or B, somebody else
found him dead,

01:00:14.652 --> 01:00:17.989
and you realized it
was the same person?

01:00:22.577 --> 01:00:24.077
- Annie.

01:00:24.078 --> 01:00:26.705
Could I take a
look at your bike?

01:00:26.706 --> 01:00:29.125
- What do you expect to find?

01:00:30.585 --> 01:00:32.502
- Nothing in particular.

01:00:32.503 --> 01:00:35.797
Unless, you have
something to hide.

01:00:35.798 --> 01:00:37.467
- No, of course not.

01:00:39.302 --> 01:00:40.510
And the answer is no,

01:00:40.511 --> 01:00:42.262
I don't want you
to check my bike.

01:00:42.263 --> 01:00:44.181
- Well, I insist.

01:00:44.182 --> 01:00:47.476
Can I please check
your bike, Annie?

01:00:47.477 --> 01:00:48.644
- I said no!

01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:52.023
- Annie, I insist that
I check your bike!

01:00:55.610 --> 01:00:56.610
- Okay.

01:00:57.570 --> 01:00:58.571
As you wish.

01:01:29.644 --> 01:01:30.644
- Okay.

01:01:33.231 --> 01:01:34.899
See you soon, Annie.

01:01:42.907 --> 01:01:45.117
- Are you into
fashion detective?

01:01:45.118 --> 01:01:47.203
- No, just a nice jacket.

01:01:50.206 --> 01:01:54.377
- Well, you know, they don't
sell it to some people.

01:02:18.526 --> 01:02:20.068
- What do you think?

01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:21.737
- Why all you girls
hate each other?

01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:23.029
- What?

01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:25.283
- She looks different.

01:02:26.701 --> 01:02:28.119
- Yeah, she does.

01:02:29.787 --> 01:02:33.165
Listen, I want you to
follow her for a few days.

01:02:33.166 --> 01:02:34.916
- That won't be a problem.

01:02:34.917 --> 01:02:38.920
I like the new look,
shoot, she look good.

01:02:38.921 --> 01:02:39.921
- You pig.

01:02:56.272 --> 01:02:58.356
- You're the one that convinced
me not to do my sister,

01:02:58.357 --> 01:03:01.277
and now she's out
being some rambo.

01:03:02.945 --> 01:03:04.655
A God damn vigilante.

01:03:08.117 --> 01:03:11.119
- Your sister?

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:15.041
You're funny, Steven.

01:03:17.835 --> 01:03:20.463
- There are two pictures of her.

01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:27.594
- This is the angel?

01:03:27.595 --> 01:03:31.640
- She's goin'
after Roger right now.

01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:33.809
When she takes care of him,

01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:35.727
you take care of her.

01:03:35.728 --> 01:03:37.480
- You'll be informed.

01:03:41.442 --> 01:03:45.821
- Hey, you know, that talkin'
about that round of golf?

01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:47.989
What about next Thursday?

01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:49.658
- Yeah, Thursday.

01:03:49.659 --> 01:03:51.577
- Okay, Thursday it is.

01:03:57.166 --> 01:04:00.419
- Hey neighbor, it's
easy, it's a girl.

01:04:01.337 --> 01:04:03.463
I never forget a favor.

01:04:03.464 --> 01:04:05.633
If you do this, you're in.

01:05:22.126 --> 01:05:23.418
Jezebel!

01:07:08.691 --> 01:07:09.691
- Hey!

01:07:10.943 --> 01:07:11.944
I'm unarmed!

01:07:13.738 --> 01:07:14.739
Don't shoot.

01:07:55.946 --> 01:07:57.948
- Do you have a lighter?

01:08:02.036 --> 01:08:04.205
Are you stupid? A lighter.

01:08:05.664 --> 01:08:08.084
- No, I don't have a lighter.

01:08:36.444 --> 01:08:40.115
- Hey, I know what
you're thinking.

01:08:40.116 --> 01:08:44.286
This crazy bitch is just gonna
shoot me in the head.

01:08:47.497 --> 01:08:49.582
Nah, why would I do that?

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:57.883
We're just gonna
have a little chat.

01:09:06.684 --> 01:09:09.353
Then I'll shoot you in the head.

01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:36.337
- Shit!

01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:02.780
- Annie.

01:10:04.241 --> 01:10:07.328
Annie, you scared
the hell out of me.

01:10:08.537 --> 01:10:10.622
- Surprised to see
me here, brother?

01:10:10.623 --> 01:10:12.917
- Well, yeah, I'm surprised.

01:10:13.792 --> 01:10:15.377
How did you get in?

01:10:16.962 --> 01:10:18.130
Annie, look...

01:10:20.341 --> 01:10:23.509
Lizette and Johanna
aren't here right now.

01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:26.138
- I know your wife is not here.

01:10:27.306 --> 01:10:28.641
But you and I...

01:10:30.643 --> 01:10:33.645
We're gonna have a little chat.

01:10:40.444 --> 01:10:43.488
I think you should answer that.

01:10:54.208 --> 01:10:55.208
- Hello?

01:10:57.086 --> 01:10:59.255
Yes, he's my brother, why?

01:11:00.839 --> 01:11:02.632
Bad news? What?

01:11:02.633 --> 01:11:03.633
My God.

01:11:04.593 --> 01:11:06.845
At his house, are you sure?

01:11:10.849 --> 01:11:14.687
Yes, detective, I'll be
there as soon as I can.

01:11:23.279 --> 01:11:26.364
- Does the name
Antoine ring a bell?

01:11:26.365 --> 01:11:27.365
- Antoine?

01:11:28.075 --> 01:11:29.075
No.

01:11:30.369 --> 01:11:33.622
- I'm sorry, you
might know him as Max.

01:11:34.498 --> 01:11:35.498
Max Black?

01:11:37.042 --> 01:11:39.335
- Nope, never heard of him.

01:11:39.336 --> 01:11:40.753
Now, look, I've gotta get
to the police station.

01:11:40.754 --> 01:11:42.089
What's goin' on?

01:11:43.382 --> 01:11:45.551
- He's gone too, you know.

01:11:52.391 --> 01:11:54.852
He won't be able to help you.

01:11:58.355 --> 01:12:00.691
You remember Proverbs 28:13?

01:12:03.152 --> 01:12:07.071
Whoever conceals their
sins does not prosper,

01:12:07.072 --> 01:12:08.823
but the one who confesses them,

01:12:08.824 --> 01:12:11.576
and renounces them finds mercy.

01:12:11.577 --> 01:12:15.163
- Annie, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:12:15.164 --> 01:12:16.664
- Really.

01:12:17.916 --> 01:12:20.251
- Are you out of
your fuckin' mind?

01:12:20.252 --> 01:12:22.670
- I gave Roger the same
chance I'm giving you.

01:12:22.671 --> 01:12:24.589
You better start
renouncing your sins.

01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:28.177
- I have no idea what
you're talking about.

01:12:34.308 --> 01:12:36.642
- I'll count to three.

01:12:36.643 --> 01:12:38.895
If you don't come
clean, I'll shoot you.

01:12:38.896 --> 01:12:39.896
One.

01:12:41.607 --> 01:12:44.067
Two.

01:12:54.119 --> 01:12:57.372
- Roger had nothing
to do with it.

01:12:57.373 --> 01:12:59.625
You killed an innocent man.

01:13:01.710 --> 01:13:05.046
It was just me.

01:13:05.047 --> 01:13:06.382
I had no choice.

01:13:08.675 --> 01:13:11.595
Please believe me,
I had no choice.

01:13:20.562 --> 01:13:21.938
And then he said
he was gonna take

01:13:21.939 --> 01:13:24.108
Roger and me off the will.

01:13:25.275 --> 01:13:27.985
And leave everything to you.

01:13:27.986 --> 01:13:30.530
Please don't kill me.

01:13:30.531 --> 01:13:31.782
I've confessed.

01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:37.620
- Steven...

01:13:40.165 --> 01:13:42.459
I didn't know.
- What?

01:13:44.128 --> 01:13:48.298
- If I had known, you
wouldn't be alive right now.

01:13:50.175 --> 01:13:51.175
- What?

01:13:53.512 --> 01:13:55.806
What are you talking about?

01:13:59.184 --> 01:14:00.184
- No...

01:14:01.395 --> 01:14:03.856
You have no idea what you did.

01:14:05.649 --> 01:14:08.818
You not only killed our parents,

01:14:08.819 --> 01:14:10.737
but you also killed me,

01:14:12.156 --> 01:14:15.659
and the worst part of
it, I'm still alive.

01:14:18.662 --> 01:14:20.205
I'm a walking dead.

01:14:20.873 --> 01:14:22.665
And now it's time for
you to go to hell.

01:14:22.666 --> 01:14:23.584
Annie!

01:14:23.585 --> 01:14:24.665
Annie, think about Lizette.

01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:29.797
Annie, think about Lizette.

01:14:29.798 --> 01:14:32.926
If you kill me, she'll be
fatherless just like you were.

01:15:11.882 --> 01:15:13.383
You'll need these.

01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:21.390
Goodbye, my brother.

01:15:30.692 --> 01:15:32.026
- You go and kill that bitch.

01:15:32.027 --> 01:15:33.694
You go after here and
you kill her, okay.

01:15:33.695 --> 01:15:35.488
You go and kill her!

01:15:49.670 --> 01:15:51.837
- Jezebel, we need to talk.

01:15:51.838 --> 01:15:55.342
Let's meet up tomorrow
night at Watermans.

01:16:12.067 --> 01:16:13.694
Hands on the table.

01:16:15.654 --> 01:16:18.532
Put your hand on the table...
- Sir.

01:16:23.537 --> 01:16:25.538
Can I get you
something to drink?

01:16:25.539 --> 01:16:27.416
- Coffee, decaf.
- Okay.

01:16:31.044 --> 01:16:32.044
- Jez...

01:16:34.381 --> 01:16:36.216
Or should I say Annie?

01:16:38.051 --> 01:16:40.720
I didn't know it was you.

01:16:40.721 --> 01:16:42.638
You gave me a fake name,

01:16:42.639 --> 01:16:44.557
and the picture looks
nothing like you.

01:16:44.558 --> 01:16:45.892
I'm truly sorry.

01:16:46.810 --> 01:16:48.060
- I'll kill you.

01:16:48.061 --> 01:16:50.063
- You need to walk away.

01:16:51.231 --> 01:16:52.773
I know Steven will give
you anything you want,

01:16:52.774 --> 01:16:54.276
anything you need.

01:16:55.986 --> 01:16:57.654
And forget all this.

01:16:59.323 --> 01:17:01.324
- You and Steven are dead.

01:17:01.325 --> 01:17:03.160
- Steven is my client.

01:17:04.578 --> 01:17:05.911
If you want him,

01:17:05.912 --> 01:17:08.081
you have to go through me.

01:17:10.417 --> 01:17:11.417
- Okay.

01:17:12.294 --> 01:17:13.294
So be it.

01:17:15.297 --> 01:17:17.882
- God dammit! I could
have killed you yesterday,

01:17:17.883 --> 01:17:18.925
and I didn't.

01:17:19.926 --> 01:17:22.303
- We all make mistakes.

01:17:22.304 --> 01:17:24.930
- You don't have a chance.

01:17:24.931 --> 01:17:25.932
- We'll see.

01:17:29.102 --> 01:17:31.104
- You're so...
- Tomorrow.

01:17:32.105 --> 01:17:33.105
6 AM.

01:17:35.651 --> 01:17:37.526
I'll be waiting for you,

01:17:37.527 --> 01:17:38.736
you know the place.

01:17:38.737 --> 01:17:41.697
- Listen to me, and
listen to me carefully.

01:17:41.698 --> 01:17:43.199
If you don't walk away,

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:45.535
I will have no mercy on you.

01:17:46.453 --> 01:17:48.120
You can't win.

01:17:48.121 --> 01:17:49.121
Let it go.

01:17:51.667 --> 01:17:54.461
- Don't be late
or I'll find you.

01:17:55.629 --> 01:17:58.799
- Jez, look, you and
I, we're special.

01:18:00.509 --> 01:18:01.760
We're the same.

01:18:04.096 --> 01:18:07.473
We can't face off
against each other.

01:18:07.474 --> 01:18:09.767
That's not fair to you
and that's not fair to me.

01:18:09.768 --> 01:18:12.019
- Here you go.

01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:13.689
- You're all I have.

01:18:15.816 --> 01:18:18.527
You're a lost
soul, just like me.

01:18:21.822 --> 01:18:25.825
I've never even told
anyone my real name before.

01:18:25.826 --> 01:18:29.663
We have a connection
that's out of this world.

01:18:31.665 --> 01:18:35.043
Killing you would be
like killing myself.

01:18:38.171 --> 01:18:40.506
Please, I'm begging you.

01:18:40.507 --> 01:18:42.384
I don't wanna lose you.

01:18:44.344 --> 01:18:47.931
- You son of a bitch,
I'm nothing like you!

01:18:49.099 --> 01:18:52.686
You killed my parents
for money, filthy money!

01:18:54.354 --> 01:18:56.647
How much you got paid?

01:18:56.648 --> 01:18:58.191
Was it enough?

01:19:00.819 --> 01:19:04.280
- They weren't even
your real parents.

01:19:04.281 --> 01:19:08.451
Why can't you get that
through your head?

01:19:08.452 --> 01:19:11.370
And you tell me about killing?

01:19:11.371 --> 01:19:12.830
Those two guys you killed,

01:19:12.831 --> 01:19:16.083
they weren't aware of my
intention to kill your folks.

01:19:16.084 --> 01:19:18.794
I brought them along to
make it look like a robbery.

01:19:18.795 --> 01:19:19.795
And Roger?

01:19:21.256 --> 01:19:24.675
That drug addict didn't have
nothing to do with anything.

01:19:24.676 --> 01:19:28.346
Killing is killing
regardless of the reason.

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:35.353
It was not for money.

01:19:37.147 --> 01:19:38.856
- Whatever the reason.

01:19:38.857 --> 01:19:41.650
- They were criminals, okay.

01:19:41.651 --> 01:19:44.153
And I did what I had to do.

01:19:44.154 --> 01:19:46.990
- Please, spare
me your stupidity!

01:19:48.617 --> 01:19:50.410
We are all criminals!

01:19:51.578 --> 01:19:55.122
We all are, and we all
deserve to die for this

01:19:55.123 --> 01:19:57.541
for whatever reason.

01:19:57.542 --> 01:19:58.918
- My parents were not criminals.

01:19:58.919 --> 01:20:01.921
- Your parents were
also criminals.

01:20:01.922 --> 01:20:04.131
That's why I do what I do.

01:20:04.132 --> 01:20:05.382
- My parents...

01:20:05.383 --> 01:20:08.260
- There is no one
clean on this earth.

01:20:08.261 --> 01:20:10.304
Yes, I kill for money,

01:20:10.305 --> 01:20:11.847
but they had something
in the closet

01:20:11.848 --> 01:20:14.433
that they should die for.

01:20:14.434 --> 01:20:17.312
I just don't care
to find that out.

01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:22.942
- You're out of
your freaking mind.

01:20:22.943 --> 01:20:25.694
You have no idea what
you're talking about!

01:20:25.695 --> 01:20:29.114
Why in the hell would
my parents be criminals?

01:20:29.115 --> 01:20:33.118
- Well, for raising two
kids like Steven and Roger.

01:20:33.119 --> 01:20:35.038
That's criminal enough.

01:20:37.249 --> 01:20:40.252
- And I thought I
was the crazy one.

01:20:42.629 --> 01:20:45.464
- If I get up from this table,

01:20:45.465 --> 01:20:48.593
you become just
another target to me.

01:20:50.303 --> 01:20:52.055
Don't break my heart.

01:20:55.559 --> 01:20:57.310
- Get out of my face.

01:21:12.868 --> 01:21:15.035
- You know what?

01:21:15.036 --> 01:21:17.371
You should have seen them.

01:21:17.372 --> 01:21:18.832
Poor old bastards.

01:21:20.542 --> 01:21:23.836
Don't shoot me,
please don't shoot me.

01:21:23.837 --> 01:21:25.921
Yeah, and what I told them,

01:21:25.922 --> 01:21:28.841
"Here's a little present
from your son, Steven."

01:24:48.625 --> 01:24:49.751
Go get her!

01:27:15.855 --> 01:27:16.855
- Antoine.

01:27:18.733 --> 01:27:21.151
- Using my real
name won't help you.

01:27:21.152 --> 01:27:23.321
- Give me a second chance.

01:27:24.447 --> 01:27:25.447
A duel.

01:27:28.034 --> 01:27:30.410
Let me die the way I want.

01:27:30.411 --> 01:27:31.411
- A duel?

01:27:32.538 --> 01:27:35.123
You still think you can beat me.

01:27:35.124 --> 01:27:36.876
- You fuckin' coward!

01:27:48.888 --> 01:27:52.392
- Fine, if that's the
way you wanna die...

01:27:54.143 --> 01:27:55.895
You'll get your duel.

01:30:09.028 --> 01:30:10.696
It's behind you!

01:32:42.306 --> 01:32:44.308
- Always the heart.

01:32:48.271 --> 01:32:50.106
- Smart, but not fair.

01:32:52.525 --> 01:32:55.860
- Life is not fair you
worthless piece of shit!

01:32:59.198 --> 01:33:00.866
- Go to hell, bitch.

01:33:02.577 --> 01:33:03.869
- You go first.

01:33:12.253 --> 01:33:14.212
- You won't Jez.

01:33:14.213 --> 01:33:15.715
You can't kill me.

01:33:21.053 --> 01:33:22.053
- Dammit.

01:33:24.307 --> 01:33:27.143
- I'll be back,
don't go anywhere.

01:33:32.690 --> 01:33:33.690
- Awe shit.

01:33:58.591 --> 01:34:00.342
- Max, it's Steven.

01:34:00.343 --> 01:34:01.885
I haven't heard from
you in a few days,

01:34:01.886 --> 01:34:04.472
I need to know what's goin' on.

01:34:10.770 --> 01:34:11.936
I need you here with me,

01:34:11.937 --> 01:34:14.315
now talk to me, call me back.

01:34:51.102 --> 01:34:52.102
- Daddy!

01:34:53.062 --> 01:34:54.437
- Hi sweetheart!

01:34:54.438 --> 01:34:56.106
My gosh!

01:34:56.107 --> 01:34:57.691
Now, Daddy's making a call,

01:34:57.692 --> 01:34:58.983
so you go play.

01:34:58.984 --> 01:35:01.821
Don't go near the
water though, okay.

01:36:03.048 --> 01:36:04.049
- My God!

01:36:10.556 --> 01:36:11.931
Lizette?

01:36:11.932 --> 01:36:12.892
Lizette!

01:36:12.893 --> 01:36:13.843
- Mom.

01:36:13.893 --> 01:36:14.852
- Are you okay, honey?

01:36:14.853 --> 01:36:15.894
Don't look, don't look sweetie.

01:36:15.895 --> 01:36:17.771
My God!

01:39:55.698 --> 01:39:57.657
- What happened?

01:39:57.658 --> 01:40:00.159
- You were in a coma.

01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:03.663
For almost six or seven weeks.

01:40:03.664 --> 01:40:05.415
I've already called Johanna,

01:40:05.416 --> 01:40:07.875
and she's on her way
over with Lizette.

01:40:07.876 --> 01:40:09.377
- Lizette?

01:40:09.378 --> 01:40:12.630
- She was able to fool that
man who murdered your parents.

01:40:12.631 --> 01:40:15.049
Steven and Roger, they
hired that hit man

01:40:15.050 --> 01:40:16.592
And he shot you too,

01:40:16.593 --> 01:40:18.511
don't you remember?

01:40:18.512 --> 01:40:20.179
- And Roger too?

01:40:20.180 --> 01:40:22.057
This man, he turned
against them,

01:40:22.266 --> 01:40:23.600
and ot Steven.

01:40:24.101 --> 01:40:26.019
- And Roger?

01:40:26.020 --> 01:40:30.607
- Roger, they found him
dead with two prostitutes,

01:40:30.649 --> 01:40:32.985
died from a heroin overdos

01:40:51.211 --> 01:40:53.880
- Hello Annie, listen...

01:40:53.881 --> 01:40:55.882
Could you see the
man that shot you?

01:40:55.883 --> 01:40:59.844
Could you tell us about
him to our sketch artist?

01:40:59.845 --> 01:41:00.845
Anything.

01:41:01.847 --> 01:41:03.765
I know he shot you
at point blank.

01:41:03.766 --> 01:41:07.519
I know you probably
saw something, right?

01:41:07.853 --> 01:41:09.103
- No.

01:41:09.104 --> 01:41:11.272
- Annie, come on, he
murdered your parents.

01:41:11.273 --> 01:41:13.566
He almost killed
you and your niece.

01:41:13.567 --> 01:41:14.901
Just think for a moment.

01:41:14.902 --> 01:41:17.820
He's leaving bodies everywhere.

01:41:17.821 --> 01:41:23.202
You've gotta remember,
please try, try to remember.

01:41:24.328 --> 01:41:27.705
We can't find...
- Detective, enough, enough.

01:41:27.706 --> 01:41:29.415
- Okay, I'm sorry.

01:41:29.416 --> 01:41:31.834
Ashton, our hero, he
found the revolver

01:41:31.835 --> 01:41:33.920
in the guy's apartment.

01:41:33.921 --> 01:41:36.005
The one that he
used to shoot you,

01:41:36.006 --> 01:41:38.382
and the same one he used
to murder your parents.

01:41:38.383 --> 01:41:41.469
We even found your
picture in his apartment.

01:41:41.470 --> 01:41:44.430
I'm glad you're
doing a lot better Annie.

01:41:44.431 --> 01:41:45.890
Ma'am.

01:41:45.891 --> 01:41:47.226
Let's go Ashton.

01:41:47.976 --> 01:41:50.479
Brought your favorite cookies.

01:41:52.689 --> 01:41:54.108
Catch you later.

01:41:54.650 --> 01:41:56.651
- Annie, omorrow
we're going home,

01:41:56.652 --> 01:42:01.155
and we're gonna be a
family, a real family.

01:42:01.156 --> 01:42:02.156
- A family.

01:43:17.065 --> 01:43:18.065
Aunt Laura!

01:43:19.234 --> 01:43:20.234

01:43:21.486 --> 01:43:22.779
