[soft music plays]

00:45.179 --> 00:47.913
[music continues]

01:27.888 --> 01:29.154
- Maghreb...

01:30.624 --> 01:33.559
My beloved Shahzadi...

01:33.561 --> 01:38.197
I fear my time is short
and I must secure the realm.

01:40.768 --> 01:44.303
My loyal adviser, Maghreb,

01:44.305 --> 01:47.840
you have long served
our people as their Vizier.

01:47.842 --> 01:51.577
And I can think of no other
to fill your shoes as well.

01:52.947 --> 01:54.446
- Thank you, my Sultan.

01:54.448 --> 01:57.649
My only wish is to continue
to serve our people.

01:58.986 --> 02:00.352
- And so you shall.

02:00.354 --> 02:04.289
Maghreb, you shall
continue your role

02:04.291 --> 02:07.559
as most wise and
trusted counselor.

02:07.561 --> 02:11.463
Upon my death,
Princess Shahzadi

02:11.465 --> 02:15.734
shall rule as
Sultana of Baghdad.

02:15.736 --> 02:17.102
Allah's will be done.

02:18.906 --> 02:20.372
- No!

02:20.374 --> 02:21.507
No!

02:21.509 --> 02:23.142
It is my turn!

02:23.144 --> 02:24.343
It is my right!

02:25.312 --> 02:27.846
No woman has ever
led our people!

02:27.848 --> 02:30.115
It would be...
It would be an abomination!

02:31.485 --> 02:34.086
- It is my wish and my command!

02:35.823 --> 02:38.123
Shahzadi has
proven her worth

02:38.125 --> 02:40.626
and our commitment
to our people.

02:41.729 --> 02:43.829
Times change.

02:43.831 --> 02:48.000
She has earned the right
to rule in my stead.

02:48.002 --> 02:50.202
So it shall be.

02:52.406 --> 02:54.406
- This... This is sacrilege!

02:55.543 --> 02:56.775
Out of my way!

03:00.014 --> 03:03.282
- He can be
a trifle troublesome.

03:03.284 --> 03:07.419
But my daughter,
you will manage.

03:11.525 --> 03:14.860
[speaking foreign language]

03:20.534 --> 03:23.535
- By the power given
to me by the Dark Ones,

03:23.537 --> 03:26.572
I command you to come to me!

03:30.911 --> 03:32.678
Here you are.

03:32.680 --> 03:35.447
Mine, all mine.

03:38.652 --> 03:39.985
[grunts]

03:39.987 --> 03:41.620
Still not strong enough!

03:43.958 --> 03:47.159
Patience, patience.

03:50.064 --> 03:52.130
If you will not come to me,

03:52.132 --> 03:55.033
then I shall brave
the cave alone.

03:55.035 --> 03:58.537
Then we shall see who sits
on top the throne as Sultan.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.982
- My father's favorite garden.

04:09.984 --> 04:13.151
It is fitting that we
honor his memory on this day.

04:13.153 --> 04:14.653
- It is.

04:14.655 --> 04:17.589
For only here,
we will find flowers

04:17.591 --> 04:20.158
that match your beauty,
Your Highness.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.692
[chuckles]

04:21.695 --> 04:24.129
- I've already forgiven
your outburst

04:24.131 --> 04:26.198
in my father's chambers.

04:27.001 --> 04:28.600
- And I am grateful,

04:28.602 --> 04:32.104
but my sentiments, they are
sincere, Your Highness.

04:32.106 --> 04:34.239
- Flowery flattery, Vizier.

04:35.142 --> 04:36.508
- Honest praise,

04:36.510 --> 04:40.078
and today, I am just Maghreb.

04:40.080 --> 04:43.548
- Yes! It is nice to loosen
the restraints of office

04:43.550 --> 04:45.817
once in a while, is it not?

04:45.819 --> 04:47.286
- Yes, it is.

04:47.288 --> 04:50.656
Perhaps we can do
this more often...

04:50.658 --> 04:52.424
- Look! There!

04:55.829 --> 04:58.063
I love acrobats.

04:58.065 --> 05:00.899
- Mindless little monkey men.

05:04.872 --> 05:06.338
[applause]

05:26.894 --> 05:29.661
- I thought Baghdad was
supposed to be generous.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.663
- You just got here.
Give them time.

05:31.665 --> 05:34.599
- A city in celebration
is a city with money.

05:34.601 --> 05:37.903
- And I'm certain some will
find its way into our hands.

05:46.246 --> 05:47.245
- Help! Fire!

05:47.247 --> 05:49.581
Somebody put it out, quick!

05:49.583 --> 05:51.083
- Oh, no!
The fireworks have set alight!

05:51.085 --> 05:52.718
Help!

06:06.734 --> 06:08.100
[applause]

06:08.102 --> 06:09.334
- Oh!

06:22.916 --> 06:24.750
- Stop! Thief!

06:24.752 --> 06:26.585
Help! Help!

06:39.133 --> 06:40.932
- Most impressive!

06:42.803 --> 06:45.670
I should like
to reward that young man.

06:48.208 --> 06:50.041
- Indeed.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.610
Most impressive.

07:02.156 --> 07:03.855
- Oh, thank you!

07:03.857 --> 07:05.524
- All in a day's work,
my friend.

07:05.526 --> 07:08.894
Oh, speaking of which...
- Eh?

07:08.896 --> 07:10.862
- I was in the middle of mine
when all this happened.

07:10.864 --> 07:14.833
So perhaps you could
see your way to...

07:14.835 --> 07:17.702
- Are you suggesting I pay you
for doing me a favor?

07:17.704 --> 07:20.505
- The Koran says do good deeds

07:20.507 --> 07:22.541
and the rewards of
paradise await.

07:22.543 --> 07:24.209
But in the meantime...

07:24.211 --> 07:25.477
- In the meantime?

07:25.479 --> 07:28.079
I don't recall
reading that part!

07:28.081 --> 07:30.182
- Well, it certainly ought to
be in there, don't you think?

07:30.184 --> 07:31.349
- No!

07:31.351 --> 07:33.185
- Um...

07:33.187 --> 07:34.186
- Unhand me!

07:34.188 --> 07:35.587
- Ahem!

07:37.991 --> 07:39.558
- A mistake.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.293
It's not at all what
it looks like.

07:41.295 --> 07:43.628
- Fairly sure it's exactly
what it looks like,

07:43.630 --> 07:45.397
but not my concern.

07:45.399 --> 07:47.666
Someone wishes to have
a word with you.

07:52.406 --> 07:54.206
- My fortune has
seemed to change.

07:54.208 --> 07:57.142
- Your capture of the thief
was most impressive.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.477
[scoffs]

07:58.479 --> 08:01.012
What is your name, Acrobat?

08:03.784 --> 08:05.317
- Aladdin.

08:05.319 --> 08:08.620
- Forgive me.
I did not hear you.

08:11.191 --> 08:12.991
- Aladdin, my lady.

08:14.094 --> 08:16.061
- You may approach, Aladdin.

08:17.598 --> 08:19.331
[chuckles]

08:19.333 --> 08:22.033
I don't bite, Aladdin.

08:22.035 --> 08:24.936
Come here, please?

08:29.710 --> 08:33.712
This charm has been
in my family for many years.

08:34.581 --> 08:37.549
It has protected me from evil

08:37.551 --> 08:40.552
and now it shall protect you.

08:45.359 --> 08:47.425
- It is too much, my lady.

08:47.427 --> 08:48.927
- He's most certainly right.

08:48.929 --> 08:50.795
It's far too much,
Your Highness.

08:50.797 --> 08:54.199
- Your bravery deserves reward

08:55.802 --> 08:58.003
and I want you to have this.

09:13.554 --> 09:16.855
A pleasure to meet you,
Acrobats...

09:17.858 --> 09:18.924
Aladdin.

09:32.439 --> 09:34.539
[gasps]

09:36.677 --> 09:38.176
- What just happened?

09:38.178 --> 09:39.611
- Do you honestly not know?

09:39.613 --> 09:42.013
- Allah has given him eyes
and he doth not see.

09:42.015 --> 09:45.116
- Stop that.
You're not a holy man.

09:45.118 --> 09:47.552
- Words of the righteous
may fall from any lip.

09:47.554 --> 09:52.857
- Aladdin, do you not know why
this city is celebrating today?

09:52.859 --> 09:55.427
- One Sultan goes,
another Sultan comes.

09:55.429 --> 09:56.628
What of it?

09:56.630 --> 09:59.798
- Not Sultan.
Sultana.

10:00.434 --> 10:02.500
[uplifting music plays]

10:06.640 --> 10:08.540
- Yes, you fool.

10:08.542 --> 10:11.443
You just met
the ruler of Baghdad.

10:11.445 --> 10:12.644
- Wait!

10:14.481 --> 10:15.947
How could I miss that?

10:15.949 --> 10:17.616
- Well, perhaps the charms
on her wrist

10:17.618 --> 10:19.851
weren't the only charms
you were focused on.

10:19.853 --> 10:21.419
- I was thinking that myself.

10:21.421 --> 10:24.122
- I was thinking she seemed
to like Acrobat Aladdin.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.790
- I was thinking
that myself, too.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.359
- You're both mad.

10:27.361 --> 10:29.027
She was...

10:29.029 --> 10:31.096
She was merely toying
with a peasant.

10:31.098 --> 10:33.131
[laughs]

10:33.133 --> 10:35.200
- Peasants don't get
silver gifts.

10:35.202 --> 10:37.702
Deeper currents run
in this river.

10:37.704 --> 10:40.705
- Allah hath said...
- Stop it!

10:49.182 --> 10:53.018
- My friends, give me a moment
to gather my thoughts.

10:54.655 --> 10:55.854
I'll be back.

11:06.867 --> 11:09.367
- I assume by now
you know who I am.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.903
- Greetings, Vizier.

11:12.839 --> 11:15.040
- Well met, Acrobat.

11:15.042 --> 11:16.875
- Aladdin.

11:18.779 --> 11:21.346
- You know, the palace
could use a man like you

11:21.348 --> 11:26.317
with such skills and
talents, Acrobat.

11:26.319 --> 11:29.087
- I've already received
my payment from the palace.

11:31.725 --> 11:34.793
- A man such as yourself
does not work for charity.

11:34.795 --> 11:36.895
- A man such as me?

11:38.298 --> 11:40.098
- A real man earns his way.

11:41.601 --> 11:46.738
I offer a task and the payment
is far greater than the award.

11:46.740 --> 11:48.940
- What could be worth
more than that?

11:50.377 --> 11:55.780
- Perhaps an invitation to
an audience with the Sultana?

11:57.784 --> 11:59.050
- The Sultana?

11:59.052 --> 12:01.152
- Mmm.
Why, it is she who needs you,

12:01.154 --> 12:04.789
a man with your talents
and skills, young man.

12:05.826 --> 12:07.425
- An acrobat, it seems.

12:07.427 --> 12:08.693
[chuckles]

12:08.695 --> 12:10.628
- Just so, just so.

12:10.630 --> 12:12.163
Assist me in
completing this task

12:12.165 --> 12:13.965
and I shall promptly escort you
to the palace

12:13.967 --> 12:17.202
where you can pick up
where you left off.

12:19.573 --> 12:22.741
She saw a very brave and
resourceful young man today,

12:22.743 --> 12:25.844
one that certainly
piqued her interest.

12:27.681 --> 12:29.180
Now come.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.683
We must reach our destination
before the moon is full.

12:34.488 --> 12:35.820
[chuckles]

12:35.822 --> 12:38.957
My friends, they need me.
Our act...

12:38.959 --> 12:41.659
- Currently Sultana needs you

12:41.661 --> 12:44.028
and she awaits our return.

12:44.030 --> 12:47.832
Now come.
We must leave at once.

13:03.784 --> 13:05.216
- First he's flirting
with princesses.

13:05.218 --> 13:06.951
Now he's riding with royalty?

13:06.953 --> 13:08.620
- Are Viziers royal?

13:08.622 --> 13:10.388
- Do they arrest
you for flirting?

13:11.625 --> 13:13.124
- He doesn't look arrested.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.093
- He doesn't look happy either.

13:15.929 --> 13:17.162
Something is going on.

13:17.164 --> 13:19.831
- When Allah directs
a strong wind,

13:19.833 --> 13:22.133
a man must sail that course.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.068
- Guys, we gotta
go grab horses and follow...

13:24.070 --> 13:25.270
- Follow them, agreed!

13:30.577 --> 13:32.243
[horse whinnies]

13:34.881 --> 13:37.649
- Truly a desolate wasteland.

13:37.651 --> 13:39.484
I thought there
was nothing out here.

13:40.987 --> 13:45.056
- The desert holds many,
many secrets, Acrobat.

13:46.293 --> 13:48.293
- Aladdin.

13:48.295 --> 13:49.294
My name is Aladdin.

13:50.730 --> 13:52.997
- Names and titles
are interchangeable

13:52.999 --> 13:55.967
and unimportant, I say.

14:02.843 --> 14:04.909
[horses neigh]

14:04.911 --> 14:07.378
- So, Vizier, what do
you require of me?

14:11.785 --> 14:13.384
- Demon!

14:13.386 --> 14:14.686
[chuckles]

14:14.688 --> 14:16.187
- Vessel.
Vessel, boy.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.523
The will of Allah
runs through me.

14:18.525 --> 14:21.826
I am but a holy man
carrying out His will.

14:25.031 --> 14:26.231
- What does he wish?

14:27.534 --> 14:31.035
- Inside, there is
a caravan of treasure,

14:31.037 --> 14:33.504
a cache of wealth that
has been carried down

14:33.506 --> 14:37.041
from Sultan to Sultan
since time immemorial.

14:37.043 --> 14:39.344
- I always wondered
where the money came from.

14:40.881 --> 14:42.647
There's a lamp.

14:42.649 --> 14:45.550
It represent the Sultana's
right to rule.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.652
You must retrieve the lamp
and bring it to her immediately

14:47.654 --> 14:48.887
so that she may bless it.

14:48.889 --> 14:51.723
Then we return the lamp
so it will await

14:51.725 --> 14:53.491
its next eventual ruler.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.230
There are obstacles
inside the cave.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.566
And, unfortunately,
I am too old and beat up

15:01.568 --> 15:03.935
to contend with them, so...

15:03.937 --> 15:07.572
Now this staff
will light your way.

15:07.574 --> 15:11.476
And this rope will help
you with said obstacles.

15:11.478 --> 15:13.011
Simply unwind it

15:13.013 --> 15:16.648
and place it in any hole
you come across and let it go.

15:16.650 --> 15:18.283
- It will drop.

15:18.285 --> 15:19.484
- You must return
before moonset,

15:19.486 --> 15:21.252
for that is when
the cave will close

15:21.254 --> 15:23.721
and I will be unable to open it
until the next full moon.

15:23.723 --> 15:27.825
- I will have some tales to tell
the Sultana when we return.

15:27.827 --> 15:29.560
- Yes, yes, yes.
Yes, you shall.

15:29.562 --> 15:31.296
Now go, please.

15:50.784 --> 15:52.317
- He said let it go and drop.

15:55.889 --> 15:58.056
By the Prophet!

16:09.135 --> 16:11.102
[bats squeaking]

16:18.345 --> 16:20.011
[grunts]

16:20.914 --> 16:22.513
Oh...

17:06.425 --> 17:08.226
[sighs]

18:01.314 --> 18:04.315
So every new Sultan or
Vizier makes this trip?

18:09.189 --> 18:11.756
Again with the fire?

18:18.465 --> 18:19.630
[grunts]

19:25.665 --> 19:28.733
A man could spend a lifetime
trying to find the real lamp.

19:30.703 --> 19:32.203
Apparently, someone did.

19:49.522 --> 19:52.557
The light of knowledge destroys
the darkness of ignorance.

19:56.196 --> 19:57.662
[chuckles]

20:27.760 --> 20:29.427
Finally.

20:51.718 --> 20:52.717
Oh!

21:14.107 --> 21:15.840
Vizier!

21:19.178 --> 21:20.645
[grunts]

21:22.148 --> 21:23.381
Vizier!

21:26.819 --> 21:28.552
- Thank you... fool!

21:28.554 --> 21:31.489
How dare you touch the
Sultan of Baghdad!

21:38.131 --> 21:39.730
Oh, no!

21:39.732 --> 21:41.866
No! No!

22:02.488 --> 22:04.488
- Where's Aladdin?
- Shh.

22:04.490 --> 22:07.325
We'll follow his tracks
back after he passes.

22:07.327 --> 22:09.460
- Then we need to go now.

22:19.706 --> 22:21.372
[groans]

22:50.269 --> 22:51.502
- There it is.

22:54.073 --> 22:55.973
This makes you Sultan?

23:23.202 --> 23:24.802
- There! Look!

23:26.139 --> 23:28.406
- Like a well-thrown dart
in a game of chance.

23:28.408 --> 23:30.508
The hand of Allah
has guided our steps.

23:30.510 --> 23:32.676
- Thank you, oh, Wise One!

23:32.678 --> 23:35.513
- Enough!
Aladdin needs us.

23:51.664 --> 23:53.364
- Alas, our friend is entombed.

23:53.366 --> 23:54.999
We're too late!

23:55.001 --> 23:56.801
- Already I miss him.

23:56.803 --> 23:59.537
- Already I miss
the 30 drachma he owes me.

23:59.539 --> 24:00.805
- It was only 20!

24:03.876 --> 24:05.443
- By the Prophet!

24:05.445 --> 24:06.811
- Aladdin!

24:09.549 --> 24:11.148
- I knew you were alive.
I tried to tell them.

24:11.150 --> 24:13.751
[laughs]

24:13.753 --> 24:15.486
- First you were enslaved
and then entombed?

24:15.488 --> 24:16.787
How comes this?

24:16.789 --> 24:19.290
- I was entombed,
but not enslaved, Samad.

24:19.292 --> 24:21.091
- What of the Vizier?

24:21.093 --> 24:24.361
- It is a story long in
the telling, my friends.

24:24.363 --> 24:26.630
- Then start it properly
at the beginning.

24:33.840 --> 24:37.441
- The lamp still evades us,
my little pet.

24:40.680 --> 24:44.949
But I will be Sultan and
Shahzadi will be my bride.

24:44.951 --> 24:48.786
At moonrise, I retrieve
what is mine!

24:51.057 --> 24:54.492
- And then I catapulted out of
the cave and into your arms.

24:55.995 --> 24:57.962
- Tell me again about
the special lamp?

24:57.964 --> 25:00.898
- It is a symbol of
the Sultan's right to rule.

25:00.900 --> 25:03.901
The new Sultan or Sultana
must bless it

25:03.903 --> 25:05.703
and then it must be
returned to the cave.

25:05.705 --> 25:07.671
- I've never heard
of such a thing.

25:07.673 --> 25:10.040
And I've lived in
Baghdad my whole life.

25:10.042 --> 25:11.542
- All 23 years of it.

25:11.544 --> 25:14.678
- I agree. There's something
more below the surface here.

25:14.680 --> 25:17.147
- Let's have a look at
the wellspring

25:17.149 --> 25:18.649
of all these woes.

25:23.789 --> 25:26.190
Well, it's definitely a lamp.

25:26.192 --> 25:27.191
- Okay.

25:28.427 --> 25:29.860
It's an ordinary lamp.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.862
- Why would there be
so many traps guarding it?

25:31.864 --> 25:33.230
- Who knows why royals
do anything they do?

25:33.232 --> 25:34.865
I once heard...
- If it's worth something

25:34.867 --> 25:37.268
to the Vizier,
then it's worth something to us.

25:37.270 --> 25:39.069
We could sell it.

25:42.542 --> 25:43.758
- I don't know.

25:43.759 --> 25:44.975
- We used the last of
our coins on the horses.

25:44.977 --> 25:46.443
- And I don't think
the Vizier is going to be

25:46.445 --> 25:47.978
paying you any time soon.

25:49.382 --> 25:51.081
Perhaps you could
sell the charm.

25:52.485 --> 25:55.519
- I'll clean up the lamp,
then we'll sell it.

25:56.789 --> 25:58.556
- I still think
there's something special

25:58.558 --> 26:00.124
about that lamp.

26:05.932 --> 26:07.097
- Oh! Oh!

26:14.907 --> 26:18.108
- I am the Genie of the Lamp!

26:18.110 --> 26:20.611
Thou hast summoned me.

26:23.516 --> 26:25.616
Why doest thou hide, O Master?

26:26.686 --> 26:30.554
Rise so I may serve thee.

26:31.691 --> 26:34.558
- Forgive me.
I didn't summon thee.

26:34.560 --> 26:35.826
Uh...

26:35.828 --> 26:38.495
- Thou didst summon me
from the lamp.

26:38.497 --> 26:41.231
- I told you it was special.

26:41.233 --> 26:43.667
- So that's why the Vizier
wanted the lamp.

26:43.669 --> 26:45.536
- That coward!

26:45.538 --> 26:47.004
He sent you to brave the traps

26:47.006 --> 26:49.239
that he should
have braved himself!

26:50.242 --> 26:51.875
He is so unworthy.

26:52.945 --> 26:55.846
- Does that make me worthy?

26:55.848 --> 26:59.216
- Worthy of being
the Vizier's lamp lackey.

26:59.218 --> 27:00.784
- Yes.

27:00.786 --> 27:03.087
You've done well to tell me
these things, mortal.

27:04.357 --> 27:05.723
- Mortal?

27:05.725 --> 27:07.257
[chuckles]

27:07.259 --> 27:09.026
You're real?

27:09.028 --> 27:10.060
A genie?

27:10.062 --> 27:12.363
Magic is real.

27:12.365 --> 27:16.700
- I appeared out of a lamp
in a puff of smoke.

27:16.702 --> 27:18.936
Was that nothing to you?

27:20.840 --> 27:23.374
- Actually, it was
when the Vizier

27:23.376 --> 27:24.808
opened up the magic cave.

27:24.810 --> 27:27.311
- The Vizier consorts
with the Dark Ones.

27:27.313 --> 27:31.248
You must avoid him at all cost.

27:33.986 --> 27:36.086
- That will be difficult.

27:36.088 --> 27:39.757
You see, he stands
between me and a...

27:40.593 --> 27:42.126
a woman I've met.

27:42.128 --> 27:46.330
- Ah, now that is
more to my liking.

27:47.833 --> 27:50.234
Romance is my specialty.

27:50.236 --> 27:54.371
So who is this... woman?

27:54.373 --> 27:56.073
- A woman out of his league.

27:58.744 --> 28:00.778
- I woman I dare not romance.

28:00.780 --> 28:03.580
- Romance? That's what
started the entire mess!

28:03.582 --> 28:04.948
Imagined romance!

28:04.950 --> 28:07.151
- Oh, friends of my master,

28:07.153 --> 28:09.386
do you doubt
my master's affections?

28:09.388 --> 28:12.022
- Did he just call you
his master again?

28:12.858 --> 28:16.694
- He who summons me rules me.

28:16.696 --> 28:17.828
[chuckles]

28:17.830 --> 28:20.197
- I have a genie.

28:20.199 --> 28:23.400
Oh, wait.
How does this work?

28:23.402 --> 28:25.235
- What do you desire?

28:27.006 --> 28:31.241
- If I were to be honest,
at this moment, a hot meal.

28:31.243 --> 28:32.743
- A feast!

28:32.745 --> 28:34.111
For you and your friends?

28:36.749 --> 28:38.348
- Why not?

28:38.350 --> 28:41.285
Try not to over-season
the mutton, if you would.

28:42.488 --> 28:43.687
- Hmm.

28:45.825 --> 28:47.658
- By Allah!

28:47.660 --> 28:49.059
I was jesting!

28:49.061 --> 28:51.795
- Well, your stomach
said otherwise, master.

28:51.797 --> 28:53.797
- Sorcery!

28:53.799 --> 28:56.567
- Genie. Now sit.
Enjoy.

28:56.569 --> 28:58.335
Come on, come on, come on.

29:03.008 --> 29:05.809
- ♪ It wasn't the stars

29:05.811 --> 29:08.579
♪ It wasn't the heavens above ♪

29:08.581 --> 29:11.315

- How do you know all our songs?

29:19.658 --> 29:20.991
- Genie.

29:23.796 --> 29:25.229
[belches]

29:28.834 --> 29:30.334
[belches]

29:30.336 --> 29:31.735
- Ugh!
- Hey!

29:31.737 --> 29:35.139
- That stench is worse
than a dead camel's backside.

29:35.141 --> 29:37.608
[belches]

29:37.610 --> 29:39.042
- Eh.

29:43.816 --> 29:46.416
[belches]

29:47.653 --> 29:50.487
- Oh, excuse me.

29:53.425 --> 29:55.993
- Aladdin, surely this genie
can give you

29:55.995 --> 29:58.796
whatever your heart desires.

29:58.798 --> 30:00.330
- Indeed I can, master.

30:02.802 --> 30:05.803
- I have all that
I could ever need.

30:05.805 --> 30:08.739
I have you, my good friends

30:08.741 --> 30:10.841
who are to me as family.

30:12.344 --> 30:14.378
I have my health.

30:14.380 --> 30:15.445
Our life is pleasant.

30:16.949 --> 30:18.148
I lack for nothing.

30:19.151 --> 30:20.450
- There's nothing missing?

30:21.587 --> 30:22.953
- If I'm to be honest...

30:26.091 --> 30:28.025
the only thing missing
would be love.

30:29.595 --> 30:31.028
And Shahzadi is the only piece

30:31.030 --> 30:32.830
that would make the puzzle
of my life complete.

30:32.832 --> 30:34.364
- Shahzadi?

30:35.501 --> 30:36.834
She can be yours!

30:37.636 --> 30:40.237
- Alas, I am unworthy.

30:42.241 --> 30:44.374
She is Sultana.

30:44.376 --> 30:47.211
And I am nothing
but a street performer,

30:47.213 --> 30:48.545
A commoner.

30:48.547 --> 30:50.681
- A peasant.
- Plebe.

30:50.683 --> 30:52.015
- A rube.
- Laborer.

30:52.017 --> 30:53.417
- Serf.
- Boor.

30:54.687 --> 30:55.986
- Ouch!

30:58.224 --> 31:01.425
- Well, I see what
you problem is, Aladdin.

31:01.427 --> 31:03.160
You two need to be equals.

31:04.496 --> 31:06.263
I shall make her a peasant.

31:06.265 --> 31:08.899
- No, no.

31:08.901 --> 31:11.134
I can't make that
decision for her.

31:13.172 --> 31:15.172
I--

31:15.174 --> 31:18.408
If I were a prince, well,
then she could consider me.

31:20.546 --> 31:22.880
- Well, I can make you a prince!

31:22.882 --> 31:24.214
Either way works for me.

31:24.216 --> 31:27.551
Mortals choose their own paths.

31:27.553 --> 31:29.286
I merely assist.

31:31.056 --> 31:32.389
- How do you get to
be a genie?

31:32.391 --> 31:33.690
Where do you come from?

31:33.692 --> 31:37.661
- We're born to it,
slaves of the mystic lamp,

31:37.663 --> 31:39.596
and the power therein.

31:40.733 --> 31:43.400
- You and the lamp are one?

31:43.402 --> 31:45.068
- If the lamp
were to be sundered,

31:45.070 --> 31:47.571
I would be my own man.

31:47.573 --> 31:49.907
But as long as it remains whole,

31:49.909 --> 31:51.108
I'm forever bound to it.

31:53.078 --> 31:55.078
- So you have no parents?

31:55.080 --> 31:56.980
No sisters? Brothers?

31:56.982 --> 31:59.149
- I am as you see me.

32:01.587 --> 32:03.453
- What's your name?

32:03.455 --> 32:05.289
- My name?

32:06.358 --> 32:07.758
Oh.

32:07.760 --> 32:11.261
In 10,000 years and
endless masters,

32:11.263 --> 32:13.463
no one has ever asked
me that before.

32:15.401 --> 32:17.367
- I like knowing
the names of my friends.

32:17.369 --> 32:20.304
- Nor has anyone
called me that either!

32:21.440 --> 32:23.206
- Then it's time
we changed that.

32:24.476 --> 32:25.876
I am Aladdin.

32:28.547 --> 32:29.947
- Aladdin.

32:29.949 --> 32:32.282
Well, my name is
far too long

32:32.284 --> 32:34.151
and too difficult
for you to say.

32:34.153 --> 32:36.420
So you may call me Friend,

32:36.422 --> 32:40.490
though I am partial
to the name Murat.

32:40.492 --> 32:41.491
- Wish come true.

32:42.828 --> 32:44.027
- Exactly.

32:44.964 --> 32:47.698
Now back to matters at hand.

32:47.700 --> 32:50.000
If a prince you wish to be,

32:50.002 --> 32:53.236
then appropriate
raiment is in order.

32:53.238 --> 32:55.806
Stand up!
Up, up, up, up.

32:55.808 --> 32:57.007
Come on, quickly, quickly.

32:58.677 --> 33:00.043
Hmm.

33:06.752 --> 33:09.019
It might look a little out
of date fashion-wise

33:09.021 --> 33:12.522
'cause it has been a minute
since I've seen what's current.

33:14.193 --> 33:17.227
- Your clothes!
You look like a prince!

33:17.229 --> 33:18.328
- See?

33:18.330 --> 33:20.664
I told you my fashion sense
was good.

33:20.666 --> 33:25.535
- I think the Sultana will still
recognize acrobat Aladdin.

33:25.537 --> 33:27.771
[Genie scoffs]

33:27.773 --> 33:29.106
- Easily rectified!

33:33.012 --> 33:35.512
- Impressive.

33:35.514 --> 33:37.814
Allah himself
would not recognize him.

33:37.816 --> 33:40.283
- Allah sees past the wrapping
to the gift within.

33:40.285 --> 33:43.887
- The wrapping has
more value than the gift.

33:43.889 --> 33:45.555
- What are you all on about?

33:55.934 --> 33:58.201
- You're still the same, Master,

33:58.203 --> 34:01.071
except everyone else
sees a different you.

34:02.508 --> 34:05.876
- I'm not sure I want
to be a "different you".

34:05.878 --> 34:08.512
- It's just what's inside
you that never changes.

34:08.514 --> 34:12.114
She will love the real you,
rest assured.

34:14.420 --> 34:16.453
There's still something missing.

34:17.755 --> 34:19.989
Ah, stand back!

34:19.992 --> 34:23.893
This will be
the end-all, be-all!

34:23.896 --> 34:26.063
- What does that even mean?

34:26.065 --> 34:28.130
[laughs]

34:48.821 --> 34:50.754
- Ya salaam.

34:50.755 --> 34:52.755
- You took the words
right out of my mouth, brother.

34:56.728 --> 35:00.430
- Well, my Master,
I believe this meets

35:00.432 --> 35:02.899
the criteria that
you commanded.

35:02.901 --> 35:04.701
[chuckles]

35:06.305 --> 35:08.805
- I suppose it'll suffice.

35:09.842 --> 35:11.441
- Suffice?!

35:11.443 --> 35:13.944
Ha!
By the beard of the Prophet!

35:13.946 --> 35:17.647
[chuckles]

35:17.649 --> 35:19.950
- I'm sorry, Murat. I...

35:19.952 --> 35:22.486
I just wanted to see what you
would do if a wish went wrong.

35:22.488 --> 35:26.456
- Well, my wishes
never go wrong.

35:27.759 --> 35:30.694
Sultana certainly
can't find fault with this.

35:32.297 --> 35:33.964
- She'll never see it.

35:33.966 --> 35:35.966
She's never left Baghdad.

35:35.968 --> 35:40.704
- Well, guess what?
I'll bring the Sultana here.

35:40.706 --> 35:45.542
- No, no, no, no!
Whoo, no! No.

35:45.544 --> 35:46.576
No magic.

35:49.047 --> 35:50.347
We'll invite her.

35:51.984 --> 35:53.817
She should come
to me on her own.

35:54.987 --> 35:56.153
- Oh.

35:56.155 --> 35:58.722
Okay, Master.
As you command.

36:27.352 --> 36:31.354
- It is nice to leave
the worries of the palace behind

36:31.356 --> 36:33.423
even for a moment, yes?

36:34.960 --> 36:38.028
- They are, unfortunately,

36:38.030 --> 36:39.729
never far behind.

36:41.667 --> 36:43.667
- Well, perhaps
the burdens of office

36:43.669 --> 36:47.304
are far too much for
one person to handle alone.

36:47.306 --> 36:50.774
- That is why I have you,
my Vizier.

36:53.946 --> 36:57.948
- Well, perhaps I could mean
more to you than just Vizier,

36:57.950 --> 37:00.650
Shahzadi, if only...

37:00.652 --> 37:03.753
- My Sultana, I bring
a message from a courier.

37:03.755 --> 37:05.222
- A courier?

37:05.224 --> 37:06.423
You may rise.

37:07.226 --> 37:09.059
A courier from whom?

37:09.061 --> 37:10.460
- I don't know, my lady,

37:10.462 --> 37:13.363
but he rode upon
a beautiful white horse.

37:21.306 --> 37:26.343
- "His Royal Highness,
Prince Ali Ababba,

37:26.345 --> 37:30.113
"extends his congratulations
to his royal neighbor

37:30.115 --> 37:35.952
and invites Her Majesty to
attend a feast in her honor."

37:35.954 --> 37:38.755
Who is Ali Ababba?

37:38.757 --> 37:43.460
- I know of no such royal family
by that name, Your Highness.

37:44.463 --> 37:47.230
- Nonetheless, we shall attend.

37:49.001 --> 37:51.001
- Ah, she's here, Master!

37:51.003 --> 37:53.236
She'll enter in moments.

37:58.110 --> 37:59.676
- I am ready to receive them.

38:05.017 --> 38:06.683
- Not quite.

38:06.685 --> 38:11.321
Your friends must not be seen
or else all will be undone.

38:11.323 --> 38:12.756
- Wait! What?

38:14.126 --> 38:15.492
- Regrets.

38:18.630 --> 38:21.865
They have all the best food
in their rooms, Master.

38:24.036 --> 38:25.468
- Very well.

38:25.470 --> 38:27.003
That was one of two concerns.

38:27.005 --> 38:28.571
- Correct.

38:28.573 --> 38:32.509
Now you, my handsome fellow,
need to make an entrance!

38:46.658 --> 38:49.859
- This is wealth unimagined,
Maghreb.

38:50.962 --> 38:52.262
- Indeed.

38:52.264 --> 38:55.532
How have we not known of
such wealth?

38:57.669 --> 39:00.303
How have I not known
of this wealth?

39:01.239 --> 39:02.972
- Where is our host?

39:27.199 --> 39:28.465
- At last.

39:29.634 --> 39:32.836
Delighted to meet you.

39:32.838 --> 39:35.572
Greetings and felicitations,
exalted guests.

39:36.808 --> 39:40.310
Welcome to my humble home,
Your Majesty.

39:42.214 --> 39:43.580
- Humble...

39:45.450 --> 39:47.350
- Thank you, Your Highness.

39:48.353 --> 39:51.721
May I introduce
my most trusted Vizier?

39:51.723 --> 39:54.924
Maghreb Arshad al-Badour.

39:54.926 --> 39:57.560
- Your invitation is most
gracious, Your Highness.

39:57.562 --> 40:02.766
Your, uh...
home is quite lovely.

40:04.169 --> 40:05.835
- Greetings to you, Maghreb.

40:07.205 --> 40:10.173
Please, permit me the honor
of giving you a small tour

40:10.175 --> 40:11.775
before we dine.

40:11.777 --> 40:14.677
- The honor and pleasure
would be ours, Your Highness.

40:16.948 --> 40:21.718
- I would be honored if you
would call me Ali, Your Majesty.

40:37.869 --> 40:39.836
- He treats me like
a little sister.

40:39.838 --> 40:41.638
- You have known each
other your whole lives.

40:41.640 --> 40:44.073
It's hard for him
to see you as anything else.

40:44.075 --> 40:46.976
- She doesn't have anything
that I don't have!

40:56.054 --> 40:57.387
Well, we know each other.

40:57.389 --> 40:59.289
I know him more
than he knows himself.

40:59.291 --> 41:01.691
- If you did, you would
see what's in his heart now.

41:08.834 --> 41:12.469
- I may steal your chef,
Prince Ali.

41:12.471 --> 41:16.372
The variety of dishes
you served was amazing.

41:16.374 --> 41:18.208
I did not know the names
of half of them.

41:18.210 --> 41:20.477
[chuckles]

41:20.479 --> 41:23.346
- Neither did I.
- Oh?

41:23.348 --> 41:25.548
- My, uh...

41:25.550 --> 41:27.951
My chef is relatively
new to this region.

41:30.322 --> 41:31.754
- This is a pleasant diversion.

41:34.159 --> 41:35.792
Your garden is lovely.

41:55.614 --> 41:57.547
- Aha! I win again.

41:57.549 --> 41:59.482
- You mean, you cheated again.

42:00.285 --> 42:01.618
- You wound me.

42:01.620 --> 42:03.086
Was there ever a man
more misunderstood?

42:03.088 --> 42:05.421
- Oh, I understand you fine,
you wooly-headed rascal!

42:05.423 --> 42:06.723
This time, you've gone too far!

42:06.725 --> 42:09.526
- Temper!
It is but magic money!

42:09.528 --> 42:11.060
- It's the principle!

42:20.839 --> 42:22.071
[grunts]

42:22.073 --> 42:23.540
- It's always
the honest man that suffers!

42:26.945 --> 42:28.645
- The Acrobats!

42:30.015 --> 42:31.714
Aladdin!

42:31.716 --> 42:33.249
Aladdin has the lamp!

42:37.722 --> 42:41.291
- Your garden is truly
remarkable, Prince Ali.

42:41.293 --> 42:44.093
- Please, just Ali.

42:46.765 --> 42:49.999
- Never have I seen
such lush growth before.

42:51.369 --> 42:53.169
Such unusual trees.

42:54.606 --> 42:58.541
- My gardener called
it a forest.

43:01.479 --> 43:03.279
- I love gardens.

43:03.281 --> 43:05.848
- As do I.

43:05.850 --> 43:09.419
As a youth, I would
sit in the trees barefoot

43:09.421 --> 43:11.054
and play the flute.

43:12.591 --> 43:14.624
- I was never allowed
to climb a tree.

43:14.626 --> 43:18.127
- Mm, rules, rituals,
restriction.

43:18.129 --> 43:19.796
- Such is our life.

43:23.134 --> 43:25.635
- You should never be afraid
to break a rule

43:25.637 --> 43:28.204
if it means
a little happiness.

43:29.808 --> 43:33.710
- Happiness is hard to come by
when you rule a kingdom.

43:33.712 --> 43:36.512
You know this.

43:36.514 --> 43:40.216
- I know I yearn for a life
that is more than ruling.

43:45.290 --> 43:49.692
- Your home is truly beautiful,
Prince Ali.

43:49.694 --> 43:53.196
- Made even more so by your
presence, Your Highness.

43:53.198 --> 43:54.497
[chuckles]

43:54.499 --> 43:57.734
- Please, no flattery.

43:57.736 --> 43:59.936
I get my fill of that at home.

44:01.206 --> 44:04.974
- Every royal does,
but surely you have

44:04.976 --> 44:07.877
learned to tell the difference
between false and real?

44:09.648 --> 44:11.948
- I seem to have
missed that lesson.

44:13.284 --> 44:16.953
- Allow me to share the chapter
you skipped, my lady.

44:21.159 --> 44:25.161
Were the stars themselves
to drop from the heavens,

44:25.163 --> 44:30.199
they could not match
the sparkle in your eyes.

44:30.201 --> 44:31.701
[giggles]

44:33.204 --> 44:36.506
- Even the dimmest village girl
would not fall for that.

44:36.508 --> 44:39.108
[giggles]

44:43.148 --> 44:48.217
- The sound of your laughter
is like unto sweet music

44:48.219 --> 44:49.886
and gladdens my heart.

44:53.158 --> 44:54.223
- That is better.

45:03.001 --> 45:05.234
- Your hands are
as warm as your smile.

45:08.373 --> 45:10.239
- They are merely hands.

45:12.243 --> 45:16.279
- They tremble
as does your heart.

45:20.118 --> 45:23.086
- I think I've learnt
the lesson, Prince Ali.

45:26.291 --> 45:27.924
- You're a quick study.

45:27.926 --> 45:29.726
- I have a good teacher.

45:29.728 --> 45:30.927
[chuckles]

45:32.597 --> 45:34.163
- And what has
the student learned?

45:37.402 --> 45:38.768
- It's the eyes.

45:40.672 --> 45:42.638
The mouth may speak,

45:42.640 --> 45:45.975
but the eyes
speak the truth.

45:45.977 --> 45:48.878
- Then you know the truth
of the matter regarding me.

45:59.491 --> 46:00.923
Your Highness?

46:02.861 --> 46:04.026
Come join me.

46:04.028 --> 46:06.662
- Prince Ali, I...
I couldn't.

46:06.664 --> 46:08.397
- Ah-ah. Mm-mm.

46:08.399 --> 46:12.301
My garden, my rules,
and there are none.

46:13.938 --> 46:15.705
Come. I'll help you up.

46:21.179 --> 46:22.812
[chuckles]

46:32.624 --> 46:35.358
- My mother used to say,

46:35.360 --> 46:39.328
"Aaliya, my heart,
time for bed.

46:41.800 --> 46:43.499
The moon will
be back tomorrow."

46:45.336 --> 46:46.335
- Aaliya?

46:47.505 --> 46:49.105
- My middle name.

46:51.876 --> 46:53.976
Father named me Shahzadi

46:53.978 --> 46:57.046
because I was a princess
in his life,

46:57.048 --> 46:59.015
not just by office.

47:00.652 --> 47:02.518
But my mother
named me Aaliya.

47:18.403 --> 47:21.771
Do you have a
private name to share?

47:27.779 --> 47:29.312
[gasps]

47:37.088 --> 47:39.856
Maghreb, what are you doing?

47:39.858 --> 47:42.325
- Don't, no.

47:42.327 --> 47:46.095
- Thank you, Prince Ali,

47:46.097 --> 47:48.231
or should I say Aladdin?

47:50.935 --> 47:53.836
- The eyes!
The acrobat!

47:54.706 --> 47:56.038
- Yes, my dear.

47:56.040 --> 47:57.874
He has deceived us
all into believing

47:57.876 --> 47:59.809
that he was a real prince.

47:59.811 --> 48:02.311
- But the palace, the garden!

48:02.313 --> 48:03.980
- All magic!

48:03.982 --> 48:06.315
- Let her go, Maghreb.

48:06.317 --> 48:07.316
- Magic?

48:08.319 --> 48:09.485
- Behold.

48:15.660 --> 48:17.260
[gasps]

48:20.098 --> 48:21.998
- Thou has summoned me, Master?

48:22.000 --> 48:24.133
Command me.

48:24.135 --> 48:27.069
- Genie, I quite
like this palace.

48:27.071 --> 48:30.139
Move it to yon
mountaintop here.

48:30.141 --> 48:32.475
I shall rule
from there as Sultan...

48:33.845 --> 48:35.745
with my new bride, of course.

48:35.747 --> 48:36.946
- No!

48:39.384 --> 48:40.716
[chuckles]

48:40.718 --> 48:44.487
- Genie, take all that
I now possess to my new home.

48:45.924 --> 48:47.757
Thank you, fool.

48:47.759 --> 48:50.359
Enjoy your return to poverty!

48:51.462 --> 48:53.296
- No, no...

48:54.599 --> 48:56.032
Shall we?

49:09.380 --> 49:11.113
- I knew it was
too good to last.

49:11.115 --> 49:12.548
- Aladdin, what happened?

49:12.550 --> 49:14.150
- The Vizier happened.

49:16.321 --> 49:18.487
And that's where we have
to go to set it right.

49:21.793 --> 49:23.092
- How would we get there?

49:23.094 --> 49:25.127
We have no horses,
no camels, no genie!

49:25.129 --> 49:26.629
Maghreb took everything!

49:26.631 --> 49:28.130
- And we will get it back.

49:28.132 --> 49:31.801
- How?
We have no weapons, no magic.

49:31.803 --> 49:32.969
- We have each other.

49:32.971 --> 49:34.670
- He has a genie.

49:36.174 --> 49:37.506
We should leave while we can.

49:37.508 --> 49:40.209
- He may not spare us
when we next meet.

49:41.079 --> 49:43.546
- Aladdin, this is a sign,

49:43.548 --> 49:47.083
a sign that we have no business
consorting with royalty.

49:47.085 --> 49:49.986
Their concerns are not ours!

49:49.988 --> 49:51.687
- In the heavens,
we all look the same,

49:51.689 --> 49:54.390
we just follow different paths.

49:54.392 --> 49:57.093
- So a wicked man in power
doesn't concern us?

50:01.366 --> 50:03.833
All of this happened
because of me.

50:03.835 --> 50:05.301
It's mine to undo.

50:08.673 --> 50:09.972
- I'm with you, Aladdin.

50:12.310 --> 50:13.576
- As am I.

50:16.114 --> 50:19.348
- When a man stretcheth
out his hand,

50:19.350 --> 50:21.384
his brother may not refuse.

50:24.188 --> 50:27.456
- Or his sister.
I'll go.

50:28.493 --> 50:29.525
But only because you lot

50:29.527 --> 50:31.460
can barely tie
your sashes without me.

50:31.462 --> 50:32.728
[chuckles]

50:48.513 --> 50:51.680
- Why, the radiance
from your cheeks

50:51.682 --> 50:55.785
shames even the moon
and stars into retreat.

50:55.787 --> 50:58.287
- What do you want, Vizier?

50:59.924 --> 51:02.992
- It is Sultan to you, my lamb.

51:04.062 --> 51:06.328
- I am not your lamb!

51:09.367 --> 51:11.333
- Genie.

51:11.335 --> 51:14.103
My betrothed
needs proper raiment.

51:15.306 --> 51:18.140
- As thy command, Master.

51:20.278 --> 51:24.180
- Ah, ever more lovely.

51:27.785 --> 51:29.285
Genie, you may go.

51:32.523 --> 51:34.924
- I will never
marry you, Vizier!

51:34.926 --> 51:38.127
- Hmm. Your venom stings,

51:38.129 --> 51:41.597
but I shall pull your
fangs soon enough.

51:41.599 --> 51:44.467
Now prepare yourself,
Aaliya...

51:46.304 --> 51:47.470
my love.

51:51.175 --> 51:53.676
- Never use that name!

52:15.099 --> 52:16.699
- That's it
unless we find more.

52:16.701 --> 52:19.668
- There should be more up
ahead by the mountain.

52:19.670 --> 52:21.137
- It is so hot already!

52:21.139 --> 52:23.906
I don't think
we can make it that far!

52:23.908 --> 52:25.708
Aladdin, we're still
close enough to Baghdad.

52:25.710 --> 52:27.476
Let us return and
grab supplies at least.

52:27.478 --> 52:28.944
- No. We don't have time.

52:28.946 --> 52:31.046
We don't know what
Maghreb's planning.

52:31.048 --> 52:32.548
We must move forward.

52:32.550 --> 52:34.517
- To be honest, I'm not
in such a hurry to meet up

52:34.519 --> 52:36.552
with a wicked man
wielding a genie!

52:36.554 --> 52:37.553
- Samad...

52:39.490 --> 52:41.590
I don't know
what fate awaits us.

52:42.860 --> 52:45.094
Take courage, brother.

52:45.096 --> 52:46.362
We will make this right.

52:52.003 --> 52:53.969
- You would die for a lie?

52:53.971 --> 52:56.805
- Even the Vizier
spoke with a little wisdom.

52:56.807 --> 52:59.542
He said it is never sad
to embrace your destiny.

53:15.193 --> 53:17.793
- I don't like this.
- Nor do I, Sister.

53:17.795 --> 53:19.595
It wreaks of sorcery.

53:19.597 --> 53:20.596
- Guys?

53:20.598 --> 53:22.731
A little help?
- Dairush!

53:25.203 --> 53:26.202
- Come on, Dariush!

53:26.204 --> 53:27.369
- I'm slipping!

53:27.371 --> 53:28.571
- It's a trap!

53:29.941 --> 53:31.273
Hold me!

53:31.275 --> 53:35.044
Dariush! Grab my hand!
Grab me, grab me.

53:35.046 --> 53:36.545
- I can't...

53:37.548 --> 53:39.315
- Dariush!
- Hold on to his hand!

53:39.317 --> 53:40.316
- Grab my hand!

53:40.318 --> 53:41.617
[grunting]

53:42.620 --> 53:44.253
No!

53:58.069 --> 53:59.935
- I have your lunch,
Your Highness.

54:24.729 --> 54:26.262
- Dariush would
have something lofty to say

54:26.264 --> 54:27.529
if he were here now.

54:29.834 --> 54:31.967
- If we weren't here,
he would be here.

54:36.140 --> 54:37.473
[wind blowing]

54:39.377 --> 54:40.442
- It's happening again.

54:40.444 --> 54:41.877
- We should get under cover!

54:41.879 --> 54:43.345
- Ah!

54:43.347 --> 54:45.281
- Sister!

54:45.283 --> 54:46.715
- Naveena!

54:50.488 --> 54:51.920
- Samad!

54:51.922 --> 54:53.589
Samad!

54:53.591 --> 54:55.724
- No!

54:55.726 --> 54:58.027
Oh--

54:58.029 --> 54:59.561
Oh, no!
- He's dead!

55:00.898 --> 55:02.364
He's dead!

55:12.043 --> 55:15.844
- I...
Am not... Your wife!

55:27.325 --> 55:32.561
- Is this truly the whole
of our world?

55:32.563 --> 55:34.897
- As thee commanded
to see, Master.

55:36.734 --> 55:41.036
- The lands beyond land,
vast oceans!

55:41.038 --> 55:45.341
There must be sights
and marvels to behold.

55:45.343 --> 55:47.409
- Oh, indeed, Master.

55:47.411 --> 55:50.913
Wouldst thou carest to see
a volcano up close?

55:50.915 --> 55:54.750
It's truly a wondrous
thing to see first-hand.

55:54.752 --> 55:58.220
Though only needst wish, hmm?

55:58.222 --> 56:01.190
- Volcano?
What is a volcano?

56:01.192 --> 56:03.625
- It's--
- Never mind.

56:03.627 --> 56:05.694
Perhaps you can tell me later.

56:05.696 --> 56:09.098
For now, I wish to hear
more about these distant lands

56:09.100 --> 56:11.233
and who dwells there

56:11.235 --> 56:13.369
and all the gold they possess.

56:13.371 --> 56:16.338
- As you wish, Master.

56:24.048 --> 56:25.381
- This is sorcery.

56:25.383 --> 56:26.749
Maghreb knows we're coming.

56:26.751 --> 56:28.717
- I don't think so.
He has set traps.

56:28.719 --> 56:30.119
But if he were watching us,

56:30.121 --> 56:33.021
he'd make certain
we'd all be dead.

56:33.023 --> 56:34.490
- He toys with us.

56:34.492 --> 56:35.958
We are but flies in his web.

56:35.960 --> 56:37.559
- It's possible,
but I have to believe

56:37.561 --> 56:39.895
that there's a chance
to set this right.

56:44.068 --> 56:45.067
We have to try.

56:46.570 --> 56:48.837
- We will all die trying?

56:50.174 --> 56:51.373
Just like Dariush?

56:54.311 --> 56:56.111
Just like...

56:57.715 --> 57:00.582
[crying]

57:00.584 --> 57:01.784
This is all your fault.

57:03.587 --> 57:05.354
If you hadn't tried
to impress a princess,

57:05.356 --> 57:08.891
we'd all be back in Baghdad now,
planning our next show!

57:08.893 --> 57:13.061
And now my brother
is dead because of you.

57:14.432 --> 57:16.465
- Naveena, I'm sorry.

57:16.467 --> 57:18.000
None of this was
supposed to happen.

57:19.236 --> 57:22.271
- If you're sorry,
let's go back now!

57:22.273 --> 57:23.672
Before it's too late!

57:23.674 --> 57:25.107
- We can't do that.

57:25.109 --> 57:26.809
We have to finish this.

57:26.811 --> 57:30.145
- We die to save a woman
you imagine you love?

57:32.550 --> 57:34.016
- He's not the only one.

57:39.824 --> 57:41.123
- Naveena...

57:42.460 --> 57:44.493
We are as family.

57:49.300 --> 57:50.499
Please.

57:52.803 --> 57:55.771
Dariush and Samad,
they were my brothers, too.

58:00.010 --> 58:01.743
- You're so blind!

58:03.280 --> 58:07.049
Dariush and Samad would follow
you to the ends of the earth!

58:07.051 --> 58:08.684
We all would...

58:10.020 --> 58:14.523
But you led us to this,
and now they're dead.

58:15.626 --> 58:17.025
I'm done.

58:17.027 --> 58:20.429
- Naveena, please.
- I will not die for her.

58:21.565 --> 58:23.165
You may follow your heart...

58:25.035 --> 58:26.768
but mine has died.

58:29.406 --> 58:30.873
I'm going back to Baghdad.

58:32.276 --> 58:34.209
Return with me and live

58:34.211 --> 58:36.612
or remain and be fools.

58:41.385 --> 58:42.284
- I'm sorry, Naveena.

58:45.756 --> 58:48.123
We have to finish this.

58:48.125 --> 58:49.725
We have to stop Maghreb.

59:21.892 --> 59:24.192
- How many guards patrolling?

59:24.194 --> 59:26.528
- When I wished for a palace,
did I wish for this many guards?

59:26.530 --> 59:28.964
- I can safely say that's the
work of the Vizier, I believe.

59:28.966 --> 59:31.567
- But that window looks
particularly inviting.

59:31.569 --> 59:33.635
- A man standing
on another man's shoulders

59:33.637 --> 59:35.504
should be able
to make it without effort.

59:35.506 --> 59:36.939
- Let's see if that's true.

01:00:37.301 --> 01:00:39.601
- Where's Maghreb
keeping the Sultana?

01:00:43.974 --> 01:00:46.441
This can be hard
or easy, my friend.

01:00:46.443 --> 01:00:50.345
I'm gonna release this gag
and you will give us answers.

01:00:54.184 --> 01:00:55.217
If you yell...

01:00:57.054 --> 01:00:59.121
we won't
be so gentle this time.

01:01:01.358 --> 01:01:03.492
Where's the Sultana being held?

01:01:03.494 --> 01:01:05.127
And what is the feast for?

01:01:06.730 --> 01:01:08.397
- You're the acrobats.

01:01:08.399 --> 01:01:09.831
- Yes.

01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:11.600
We're here to save the Sultana.

01:01:15.105 --> 01:01:16.772
- She's on the second floor.

01:01:18.142 --> 01:01:20.108
She is to be married
to the Sultan tomorrow.

01:01:22.046 --> 01:01:23.045
- The Sultan?

01:01:24.248 --> 01:01:26.882
- Maghreb.
He's made himself Sultan.

01:01:27.851 --> 01:01:29.051
We have to hurry.

01:01:33.724 --> 01:01:34.990
And forgive me.

01:01:42.433 --> 01:01:43.899
Give me that.

01:01:44.768 --> 01:01:46.268
You know nothing of fighting.

01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:47.836
- I'm learning.

01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:18.300
- Shahzadi!
- Aladdin!

01:02:18.302 --> 01:02:19.801
You came back!

01:02:19.803 --> 01:02:22.104
I am so glad to see you!

01:02:22.106 --> 01:02:23.004
- You are?

01:02:23.006 --> 01:02:26.208
- Wait! No! I'm not.

01:02:26.210 --> 01:02:27.209
You lied to me!

01:02:27.211 --> 01:02:29.911
- I can explain,
but now is not the time.

01:02:29.913 --> 01:02:31.646
- You took the words
out of my mouth.

01:02:31.648 --> 01:02:33.281
We should leave quickly.

01:02:36.453 --> 01:02:37.619
- Well, that explains that.

01:02:37.621 --> 01:02:39.554
- I need no rescuer,

01:02:39.556 --> 01:02:41.423
but I'm pleased that
you've made the effort.

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:44.426
- I could not do nothing.

01:02:46.497 --> 01:02:48.830
This is all my fault
and I have to set it right.

01:02:48.832 --> 01:02:51.933
- Your new honesty
is refreshing, Acrobat.

01:02:51.935 --> 01:02:54.436
I look forward to
hearing your tale.

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:58.306
- It's not quite over yet.

01:03:11.121 --> 01:03:13.054
- Well, that took you
long enough.

01:03:14.892 --> 01:03:17.692
Trouble with the sand traps?

01:03:17.694 --> 01:03:19.828
[chuckles]

01:03:21.331 --> 01:03:23.732
Shahzadi, my flower,

01:03:23.734 --> 01:03:26.701
consorting with
the rabble again?

01:03:26.703 --> 01:03:28.603
You know, even in
slaves' garb,

01:03:28.605 --> 01:03:31.740
you're still the most beautiful
flower in the garden.

01:03:33.210 --> 01:03:34.276
However...

01:03:36.046 --> 01:03:37.179
Genie?

01:03:41.885 --> 01:03:43.852
Much better.

01:03:43.854 --> 01:03:45.887
Now come.

01:03:45.889 --> 01:03:48.390
Come sit next to me,
my Sultana.

01:03:49.726 --> 01:03:53.195
- I am not your Sultana!

01:03:53.197 --> 01:03:55.430
- Hmm.

01:03:55.432 --> 01:03:56.431
Genie?

01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:09.945
These cherries are delicious.

01:04:12.082 --> 01:04:14.850
Your fall from grace

01:04:14.852 --> 01:04:16.184
is also delicious.

01:04:16.186 --> 01:04:18.954
- Your taste is questionable,
Vizier.

01:04:20.691 --> 01:04:21.723
- Sultan.

01:04:21.725 --> 01:04:23.558
- In name only.

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:26.695
Without the genie,
you're just a little man

01:04:26.697 --> 01:04:28.230
with a little lizard.

01:04:29.733 --> 01:04:31.900
- Hmm. Indeed.

01:04:31.902 --> 01:04:33.902
We shall rectify
that scenario.

01:04:36.106 --> 01:04:38.306
Genie, see to it that
my beloved Tanin

01:04:38.308 --> 01:04:41.276
is a formidable adversary
for the Acrobat.

01:04:43.247 --> 01:04:46.248
Oh, and be sure
that he breaths fire.

01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:49.885
That should make things
more interesting.

01:04:49.887 --> 01:04:52.520
- As thou commands, Master.

01:04:57.361 --> 01:04:58.827
[roaring]

01:05:00.964 --> 01:05:02.264
[gasps]

01:05:05.836 --> 01:05:07.168
- What were you thinking?

01:05:07.170 --> 01:05:09.104
- I thought
he'd fight me himself!

01:05:09.106 --> 01:05:11.473
- If we live through this,
I will <i> kill</i> you myself!

01:05:20.384 --> 01:05:21.783
- Aladdin!

01:05:21.785 --> 01:05:24.319
- You've never understood
the office which you held.

01:05:24.321 --> 01:05:25.987
The people don't want a friend.

01:05:25.989 --> 01:05:27.856
They want a ruler.

01:05:38.702 --> 01:05:42.404
- Here, you overgrown tadpole!

01:05:45.609 --> 01:05:47.142
[roaring]

01:05:51.949 --> 01:05:55.116
- A Sultan leads and
punishes as needed.

01:05:55.118 --> 01:05:57.352
Only a man can
know these things.

01:05:57.354 --> 01:06:02.157
- A real man doesn't need
a genie to accomplish them!

01:06:02.159 --> 01:06:05.527
- Perhaps, but it helps.

01:06:11.468 --> 01:06:16.671
- Over here, you great
big ugly belching beast!

01:06:16.673 --> 01:06:18.940
[roaring]

01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:31.553
[grunts]

01:06:58.415 --> 01:07:00.215
- Zamir!

01:07:06.490 --> 01:07:07.856
[screams]

01:07:07.858 --> 01:07:09.391
Zamir!

01:07:13.797 --> 01:07:15.230
Zamir!

01:07:22.139 --> 01:07:24.939
- Bravery is
no substitute for skill.

01:07:24.941 --> 01:07:28.610
- A thousand lashes wouldn't
be enough for you!

01:07:29.613 --> 01:07:32.080
[chuckles]

01:07:42.692 --> 01:07:45.060
- Flee, you fool.

01:07:45.062 --> 01:07:47.629
- Yes. Flee, you fool.

01:07:47.631 --> 01:07:50.465
Run back to the squalor
from which you rose...

01:07:52.669 --> 01:07:54.102
...and I will let you live.

01:08:05.115 --> 01:08:06.648
[sighs]

01:08:21.163 --> 01:08:23.531
He never gives up that easily.

01:08:25.268 --> 01:08:27.301
He's up to something.

01:08:28.404 --> 01:08:30.471
Guards, find him and kill him.

01:08:30.474 --> 01:08:33.541
- You are a serpent
made of lies!

01:08:34.344 --> 01:08:37.045
- But never with you, my sweet.

01:08:37.046 --> 01:08:39.046
[snarling]

01:08:39.049 --> 01:08:43.151
Be at ease.
This will all be over soon.

01:08:43.153 --> 01:08:44.886
[spits]

01:08:44.888 --> 01:08:46.821
Such spirit.

01:08:46.823 --> 01:08:49.057
We will make a perfect match
once your soul

01:08:49.059 --> 01:08:51.392
has blended with the Dark Ones.

01:08:53.130 --> 01:08:56.296
Genie, fetch me my
conjuring bowl and tools.

01:08:56.299 --> 01:08:59.000
We have a ceremony to perform.

01:08:59.002 --> 01:09:01.502
- Thy wish is
my command, Master.

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:13.014
- I revealed a glimpse
of the Dark Arts

01:09:13.015 --> 01:09:15.350
to that dunce Aladdin.

01:09:17.354 --> 01:09:19.420
He understood nothing.

01:09:20.256 --> 01:09:22.624
- Foolish mortal.

01:09:22.626 --> 01:09:26.361
- Yes. Yes, he is.

01:09:28.331 --> 01:09:30.198
You meant Aladdin, yes?

01:09:31.033 --> 01:09:32.667
- But, of course, Master.

01:09:36.406 --> 01:09:38.706
- I call to thee
Oh, Dark Ones.

01:09:46.483 --> 01:09:49.484
I give you my own
life blood.

01:09:52.656 --> 01:09:53.821
My devotion.

01:09:57.327 --> 01:10:01.629
I have offered them
your mind and your soul.

01:10:02.632 --> 01:10:04.232
The rest of you,

01:10:04.234 --> 01:10:06.601
well, that shall
be my reward.

01:10:06.603 --> 01:10:09.871
- You'll never live
to collect it, you swine!

01:10:09.873 --> 01:10:14.108
- There's the defiant spirit
I love so much.

01:10:14.110 --> 01:10:17.712
We'll be a perfect match
once it's aligned with mine.

01:10:17.714 --> 01:10:23.251
- What matter of man needs magic
to push his will on another?

01:10:23.253 --> 01:10:25.787
- You gave your heart
to a peasant!

01:10:25.789 --> 01:10:29.891
A charm, the likes of which
you never gave to me!

01:10:29.893 --> 01:10:31.826
- Is that where this all began?

01:10:33.063 --> 01:10:35.597
Sad fool...

01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:41.636
My heart was
never yours to claim!

01:10:41.638 --> 01:10:46.074
- That sharp tongue shall
be first thing I silence!

01:10:46.076 --> 01:10:50.645
- Oh! Oh!

01:11:00.957 --> 01:11:05.994
- The Dark Ones bless me
with their countenance.

01:11:05.996 --> 01:11:07.662
I am their living vessel.

01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:14.369
- Well, if thou has such power,
what need has thou for me?

01:11:16.473 --> 01:11:18.673
- The price they exact
is a high one.

01:11:18.675 --> 01:11:21.609
My years shall fade
much like the leaves

01:11:21.611 --> 01:11:25.513
that drift from
a tree in the fall.

01:11:25.515 --> 01:11:29.183
You shall act as my conduit
from this day forth

01:11:29.185 --> 01:11:31.085
to carry out my will

01:11:31.087 --> 01:11:35.223
so that I may live
my years of leisure with her.

01:11:40.764 --> 01:11:43.431
It shall be
my last act of magic.

01:11:45.201 --> 01:11:48.303
The Dark Ones call
to you, Shahzadi!

01:11:48.305 --> 01:11:50.672
[screams]

01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:11.793
- Stop it, you fool! It's me!

01:12:11.795 --> 01:12:14.796
Maghreb is protected!
Destroy the bowl!

01:12:14.798 --> 01:12:15.997
Save Shahzadi!

01:12:27.344 --> 01:12:28.976
- No!

01:12:43.193 --> 01:12:45.393
You think you've won?

01:12:47.263 --> 01:12:49.397
You worthless dog.

01:12:49.399 --> 01:12:51.232
Come claim your reward.

01:12:51.234 --> 01:12:53.234
Tanin!

01:12:53.236 --> 01:12:55.570
[roars]

01:12:57.407 --> 01:12:59.307
- The dragon's weak spot
is his eyes.

01:12:59.309 --> 01:13:01.042
Go for the eyes!

01:13:06.816 --> 01:13:12.987
- I confess I am most
impressed, Acrobat.

01:13:14.224 --> 01:13:17.258
Few men have had
a day such as yours

01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:18.860
and lived to tell the tale.

01:13:21.331 --> 01:13:25.767
Why, you wooed a Sultana
and won her heart.

01:13:25.769 --> 01:13:29.070
You braved the Cave of Death.

01:13:29.072 --> 01:13:31.472
Did I mention that's
the real name of that cave?

01:13:31.474 --> 01:13:33.441
[chuckles]

01:13:33.443 --> 01:13:35.777
You had a genie, a palace

01:13:35.779 --> 01:13:39.580
and true love all
in the span of a day.

01:13:39.582 --> 01:13:41.849
You fought a dragon,
and lived.

01:13:43.353 --> 01:13:44.819
All for her.

01:13:47.891 --> 01:13:48.956
Was it worth it?

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:52.527
Perhaps we should
ask your friends.

01:13:53.730 --> 01:13:57.365
You had friends with you
when you came in, right?

01:13:58.768 --> 01:14:02.069
Loyal friends, I recall now.

01:14:02.071 --> 01:14:06.974
Loyal to the end,
I believe the phrase goes.

01:14:06.976 --> 01:14:12.046
But they all met their end
helping you find true love.

01:14:13.850 --> 01:14:15.616
[chuckles]

01:14:15.618 --> 01:14:19.720
I just realized that
you're exactly like me.

01:14:22.025 --> 01:14:23.925
Why, you discard and
destroy anything

01:14:23.927 --> 01:14:26.861
and anyone who gets in
the way of what you want.

01:14:26.863 --> 01:14:28.362
[laughs]

01:14:28.364 --> 01:14:29.997
Why, you could be my son!

01:14:33.670 --> 01:14:35.603
Hmm, there's one
of your friends.

01:14:38.308 --> 01:14:40.208
I think I shall hear
his screams

01:14:40.210 --> 01:14:42.009
in my dreams tonight.

01:14:44.314 --> 01:14:45.580
I know that you will.

01:14:45.582 --> 01:14:47.248
[chuckles]

01:14:47.250 --> 01:14:48.449
[shouts]

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:52.119
Took you long enough.

01:14:57.093 --> 01:14:58.860
He's all yours, my pet.

01:15:02.565 --> 01:15:03.798
- We go together, Vizier!

01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:12.206
- You've learned nothing, dolt!

01:15:14.744 --> 01:15:16.344
Now die!

01:15:16.346 --> 01:15:17.912
Let me live me in peace.

01:15:19.082 --> 01:15:20.081
Tanin!

01:15:25.855 --> 01:15:28.923
Clearly a mistake,
hiring an acrobat.

01:15:32.228 --> 01:15:34.829
[roars]

01:15:34.831 --> 01:15:37.732
- Inshallah, guide my hand.

01:15:45.441 --> 01:15:46.974
- Tanin!

01:15:56.619 --> 01:16:01.088
Shahzadi gave you a powerful
charm that day, Acrobat.

01:16:10.934 --> 01:16:11.933
No!

01:16:18.408 --> 01:16:20.107
Genie?

01:16:20.109 --> 01:16:21.576
Kill him.

01:16:21.578 --> 01:16:23.644
- Yes, Master.

01:16:31.754 --> 01:16:33.120
- What is happening?

01:16:33.122 --> 01:16:34.922
Why does he still live?

01:16:34.924 --> 01:16:37.692
- I too am mystified,
O Master.

01:16:37.694 --> 01:16:40.928
- No charm is that powerful.

01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:44.065
- Yes, and he's also
an agile acrobat!

01:16:51.307 --> 01:16:53.474
Truly his skill
is unparalleled!

01:16:53.476 --> 01:16:55.309
- I am your master.

01:16:55.311 --> 01:16:57.011
You must obey me!

01:16:57.013 --> 01:17:00.147
- Thy every wish is as
a command to me.

01:17:00.149 --> 01:17:02.149
- Now slay this man.

01:17:02.151 --> 01:17:04.151
- Yes, Master.

01:17:09.125 --> 01:17:12.693
It seems he enjoys favor
from above, O Master.

01:17:12.695 --> 01:17:16.097
- Enough!
I am the holder of the lamp!

01:17:16.099 --> 01:17:17.798
- I see no lamp.

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:20.701
He who holds
the lamp commands me.

01:17:23.206 --> 01:17:25.840
- Here now be the lamp
that commands you.

01:17:25.842 --> 01:17:30.811
- Ah, yes, the lamp
that binds me with its power,

01:17:30.813 --> 01:17:33.414
never to be sundered.

01:17:33.416 --> 01:17:36.017
- Now remove him
from my sight!

01:17:36.019 --> 01:17:37.752
- Yes, Master.

01:17:43.426 --> 01:17:44.859
- At last.

01:17:44.861 --> 01:17:48.696
Never has there been
a bigger thorn in my side.

01:17:49.799 --> 01:17:52.933
You and I have much
to discuss, Genie.

01:17:52.935 --> 01:17:56.370
There is no place for friendship
in the realm of rule.

01:17:58.074 --> 01:18:00.307
- ALADDIN: Friendship
is the greatest treasure

01:18:00.309 --> 01:18:02.677
of all, you demon.

01:18:02.679 --> 01:18:04.211
- You still live?

01:18:04.213 --> 01:18:07.882
Treacherous slave, kill him
and be done with it!

01:18:07.884 --> 01:18:11.619
- No lamp, no Master.

01:18:13.156 --> 01:18:15.056
- Fine.

01:18:18.327 --> 01:18:19.794
[shouts]

01:18:22.432 --> 01:18:23.631
Finally.

01:18:30.306 --> 01:18:31.706
You speak of friendship?

01:18:33.042 --> 01:18:36.110
That knife sure looks like
it could use a companion.

01:18:44.053 --> 01:18:46.721
I hope there's enough life
left in you to see

01:18:46.723 --> 01:18:49.423
what I do to your last friend.

01:18:53.963 --> 01:18:56.664
What do you imagine you're
going to do with that?

01:18:56.666 --> 01:18:58.365
- This!

01:19:13.149 --> 01:19:14.682
You came back.

01:19:14.684 --> 01:19:17.218
- I told you that you couldn't
tie your sashes without me.

01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:18.385
[laughs]

01:19:18.387 --> 01:19:19.987
- Genie, come forth!

01:19:25.595 --> 01:19:29.130
The Dark Ones
still favor me, peasant!

01:19:36.239 --> 01:19:37.404
- Ah!

01:19:54.690 --> 01:19:59.026
- Even to the end,
you avoid your fate.

01:19:59.028 --> 01:20:01.862
- Dodging things is what I do.

01:20:01.864 --> 01:20:03.831
- That's all you've
ever been good at.

01:20:04.634 --> 01:20:06.567
[grunts]

01:20:06.569 --> 01:20:08.435
That is for my pet!

01:20:10.206 --> 01:20:11.939
That's for stealing the lamp!

01:20:13.309 --> 01:20:16.076
And that is for
stealing her heart!

01:20:17.914 --> 01:20:22.082
- Will there be one for
being a better man than you?

01:20:25.988 --> 01:20:29.056
- A fitting end
to the would-be prince.

01:20:30.459 --> 01:20:34.195
- As you said, we must
all embrace our destiny.

01:20:35.398 --> 01:20:38.365
- No Genie, no friends,

01:20:38.367 --> 01:20:41.035
no charm, so no magic!

01:20:42.672 --> 01:20:44.271
Die, Acrobat!

01:21:08.564 --> 01:21:11.265
- He's waking.
- He sounds confused.

01:21:11.267 --> 01:21:12.867
[laughs]

01:21:12.869 --> 01:21:15.336
- If he thinks I'm an angel,
then he's definitely confused.

01:21:15.338 --> 01:21:16.337
[chuckles]

01:21:18.908 --> 01:21:20.908
- Not yet, my heart.

01:21:22.345 --> 01:21:24.845
You've been unconscious
for many days now.

01:21:26.582 --> 01:21:28.315
- Maghreb?

01:21:28.317 --> 01:21:29.350
Where are we?

01:21:29.352 --> 01:21:31.719
- We're safe.
We're home.

01:21:31.721 --> 01:21:33.020
You're in bed.

01:21:34.490 --> 01:21:36.523
- Maghreb is no more.

01:21:36.525 --> 01:21:38.259
You killed him.

01:21:38.261 --> 01:21:39.593
- No.

01:21:39.595 --> 01:21:42.162
A great wind came and
carried him off the cliff.

01:21:43.699 --> 01:21:45.432
- Not a great wind.

01:21:46.969 --> 01:21:48.802
He had a little push.

01:21:48.804 --> 01:21:50.170
[chuckles]

01:21:50.172 --> 01:21:51.972
I couldn't let
that two-bit sorcerer

01:21:51.974 --> 01:21:53.974
kill the best friend
I ever had.

01:21:53.976 --> 01:21:56.377
[laughs]

01:21:56.379 --> 01:21:58.112
- Thank you, Murat.

01:21:58.915 --> 01:22:00.447
My friend.

01:22:00.449 --> 01:22:03.517
But what of you now?
Where will you go?

01:22:03.519 --> 01:22:05.085
I destroyed the lamp.

01:22:05.087 --> 01:22:08.722
- Wherever I will,
former Master.

01:22:08.724 --> 01:22:11.292
I am no longer bound
to the lamp.

01:22:16.632 --> 01:22:18.933
- I am pleased.

01:22:18.935 --> 01:22:20.868
You have earned your freedom.

01:22:24.273 --> 01:22:26.807
I guess I should be
on my way as well.

01:22:26.809 --> 01:22:29.143
- On your way?

01:22:29.145 --> 01:22:30.144
- Home.

01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:33.514
I do not wish to cause you
any further trouble.

01:22:35.651 --> 01:22:36.984
- You are home.

01:22:39.488 --> 01:22:41.322
For now and forever.

01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:45.492
I found this.

01:22:48.664 --> 01:22:51.498
You cause me no trouble.

01:22:53.569 --> 01:22:55.002
Not now, anyway.

01:22:57.306 --> 01:22:58.372
- But...

01:22:59.208 --> 01:23:00.641
I'm not what you think.

01:23:01.844 --> 01:23:03.177
I am not a prince.

01:23:04.347 --> 01:23:05.346
I lied to you.

01:23:06.749 --> 01:23:08.248
- You are a prince...

01:23:09.652 --> 01:23:11.085
in here.

01:23:12.989 --> 01:23:15.222
All my life, I've had
every comfort

01:23:15.224 --> 01:23:17.524
I could ever want or buy

01:23:17.526 --> 01:23:21.395
except for the love
of a worthy man.

01:23:21.397 --> 01:23:24.465
You are a worthy man, Aladdin.

01:23:25.634 --> 01:23:27.001
And, as Sultana,

01:23:27.003 --> 01:23:31.038
I make the law and can
marry whomever I choose.

01:23:33.009 --> 01:23:37.077
I choose you,
if you'll have me.

01:23:39.081 --> 01:23:41.048
- I suppose.

01:23:41.050 --> 01:23:44.351
I have no right to refuse
a Sultana anything.

01:23:44.353 --> 01:23:48.288
- Aladdin, what was the last
thing you said to Maghreb?

01:23:50.893 --> 01:23:52.559
- We must all embrace
our destiny.

01:23:55.031 --> 01:23:58.032
- All right, everyone,
stand back! Stand back!

01:23:58.034 --> 01:24:01.402
Because I've got
a wedding to plan!

01:24:01.404 --> 01:24:05.072
[laughs]

01:24:25.828 --> 01:24:27.895
[soft music plays]

01:26:17.106 --> 01:26:19.173
[music continues]

01:27:32.348 --> 01:27:33.413
[music fades]
