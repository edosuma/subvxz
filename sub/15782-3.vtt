[sighs]

17:05.732 --> 17:07.651
Gentlemen,
I'll be right back.

17:07.733 --> 17:10.654
My butler doesn't quite know
his place yet.

17:10.737 --> 17:13.656
There's a picture of Venture
dressed as Rambo.

17:13.740 --> 17:16.284
You gotta see this.
You will piss yourself.

17:16.367 --> 17:18.453
Um, sweetie, Hatred found
the explosives.

17:18.537 --> 17:20.038
Did you not catch that?

17:20.121 --> 17:21.957
What the fuck is this?!

17:22.040 --> 17:23.666
DOC: [muffled]
He did What?!

17:23.750 --> 17:25.335
Get your crap.
We can leave through the back.

17:25.417 --> 17:28.171
Why are you old guys
doing this? Revenge?

17:28.255 --> 17:31.174
So, you wait 30 years for me
to put out a want ad?

17:31.258 --> 17:33.176
You want the truth?
You're gonna hate it.

17:33.260 --> 17:35.053
I don't even
like talking about it.

17:35.136 --> 17:37.514
Might as well.
I'm clearly not busy here.

17:37.597 --> 17:39.182
SPHINX was pretty serious.

17:39.266 --> 17:41.476
Yeah, we got our <i>asses</i> kicked
by O.S.l. all the time,

17:41.560 --> 17:43.186
but we were hard core.

17:43.270 --> 17:45.063
When you join SPHINX,
we put a cyanide chip

17:45.146 --> 17:46.064
right in your brain.

17:46.147 --> 17:48.525
100% loyalty, or we flip
the switch.

17:48.608 --> 17:51.361
Whoa. And I thought
my old job was nuts.

17:51.444 --> 17:53.071
Well, you can't get
these things out.

17:53.154 --> 17:54.698
And they don't last forever.

17:54.781 --> 17:56.575
We all have maybe a year
left to live,

17:56.658 --> 17:58.243
so when your ad came up,
we figured

17:58.326 --> 18:00.078
we could go out
like SPHINX.

18:00.161 --> 18:01.121
Flame it.

18:01.204 --> 18:04.249
Well, we have nothing to do with
your acid head... problem.

18:04.332 --> 18:06.084
Why can't you just let us go?

18:06.167 --> 18:08.336
It would ruin the commander.

18:08.420 --> 18:10.338
You look just like the Countess
in that outfit.

18:10.422 --> 18:12.382
After she left him,
he hasn't been the same.

18:12.465 --> 18:14.801
Yeah, that was
her strength suit.

18:19.139 --> 18:20.640
Totally forgot it was
a strength suit.

18:20.724 --> 18:22.267
All right.
Get to the bridge.

18:22.350 --> 18:24.686
I'm gonna try and find
the engine room.

18:24.769 --> 18:27.022
HATRED: You had a bad hit
of blotter and killed someone

18:27.105 --> 18:29.274
'cause he learned
your terrible secret?

18:29.357 --> 18:31.276
Maybe you masturbated
with a Furby.

18:31.359 --> 18:32.902
What could be so bad?

18:32.986 --> 18:35.030
I just know a little
too much.

18:35.113 --> 18:37.240
You wanna rap about it?

18:37.324 --> 18:39.534
You... want me to make up
a rhyme?

18:39.618 --> 18:41.286
No, I was trying to be a --

18:41.369 --> 18:43.830
Dean, growing up is hard.

18:43.913 --> 18:46.541
It's supposed to be.
You're not like anyone.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.251
You're -- you're Dean.

18:48.335 --> 18:49.836
And you're the best Dean.

18:49.919 --> 18:53.256
Huh.
That almost helps.

18:53.340 --> 18:55.759
So, what?
We leave them here?

18:55.842 --> 18:58.428
Yeah.
That'll send a message.

18:58.511 --> 18:59.804
Steady on course.

18:59.888 --> 19:02.307
I-I-I don't remember
this at all.

19:02.390 --> 19:04.309
You are gonna have to get
over that damn photo.

19:04.392 --> 19:06.061
I can't run this alone.

19:06.144 --> 19:08.563
Look, look!
That is me in that picture.

19:08.647 --> 19:10.607
I'm playing with Dr. Venture.
Playing!

19:10.690 --> 19:12.275
Wee! Fun! Yay!

19:12.359 --> 19:14.277
And who's that
in the background?

19:14.361 --> 19:15.945
Oh, nobody -- just my parents.

19:16.029 --> 19:17.781
Yes, fine, that's nuts.

19:17.864 --> 19:19.282
Can we talk about this later?

19:19.366 --> 19:21.826
I don't remember any
of this!

19:21.910 --> 19:24.704
GATHERS: Blondie, Sailor Boy,
this is Smoke Stack.

19:24.788 --> 19:26.289
Target is locked in.

19:26.373 --> 19:28.083
We will open fire
if you do not respond.

19:28.166 --> 19:29.459
Damn it, you two.

19:29.542 --> 19:31.378
BROCK:
Smoke Stack, this is Blondie.

19:31.461 --> 19:33.296
Hold your fire.
I'm in position.

19:33.380 --> 19:35.632
Repeat. Hold your fire.
Just give me 10.

19:35.715 --> 19:38.593
GATHERS:
Roger. Give 'em hell, son.

19:38.677 --> 19:41.054
You heard 'em, kiddies.
Stay frosty.

19:42.514 --> 19:43.431
[ mechanical whirring ]

19:43.515 --> 19:45.433
All right, weirdo,
the game is over.

19:45.517 --> 19:48.895
Knock this crap off, or I will
go karate bananas on you!

19:48.978 --> 19:50.772
Countess!

19:50.855 --> 19:52.857
Soon the O.S.l. will be
destroyed,

19:52.941 --> 19:56.111
and we can finally be
together again.

19:56.194 --> 19:59.114
Look, seriously,
I will karate you.

19:59.197 --> 20:02.158
Ow. That is entirely
not necessary.

20:02.242 --> 20:04.661
Ah, I remember kicking
your ass when I was a kid.

20:04.744 --> 20:06.496
[grunts]
- Still fun.

20:06.579 --> 20:08.456
Dude, the old SPHINX crew

20:08.540 --> 20:10.208
is gonna attack the O.S.l.
any second.

20:10.291 --> 20:12.669
Communications are down
and we're using these.

20:12.752 --> 20:13.795
What is that?

20:13.878 --> 20:16.214
It's a shake weight, I think.
I can't find anything else.

20:16.297 --> 20:17.924
I can't even find fucking
Engineering.

20:18.007 --> 20:19.134
Have you seen Hank?

20:19.217 --> 20:21.136
Nice job, Gary.

20:21.219 --> 20:24.013
You are in so much trouble.

20:26.015 --> 20:28.101
SPHINX COMMANDER:
Brock Samson.

20:28.184 --> 20:29.811
It's just like old times.

20:29.894 --> 20:32.355
I thought you went
into the private sector.

20:32.439 --> 20:33.815
Things change.

20:33.898 --> 20:35.817
So, you and The Countess figured
you'd take the jalopy out

20:35.900 --> 20:37.360
for one last ride?

20:37.444 --> 20:39.362
- Brock, it's me, Hank.
- Hank?

20:39.446 --> 20:40.989
What are you doing here,
and why --

20:41.072 --> 20:42.532
why are you on his lap?

20:42.615 --> 20:44.451
He needs my bosom, Brock.

20:44.534 --> 20:46.745
Plus, the suit is frozen.
I can't move.

20:46.828 --> 20:49.080
My Countess forgot that
her suit is programmed

20:49.164 --> 20:51.166
to never hurt her man,

20:51.249 --> 20:54.836
so put the crossbow down.

20:54.919 --> 20:57.005
Hank, uh, can you
close your eyes?

20:57.088 --> 20:59.466
- Of course.
- Then do it.

21:03.178 --> 21:04.971
- Nope.

21:05.054 --> 21:06.097
Come on, man.

21:06.181 --> 21:07.557
Oh, who's gonna feed
my snakes?

21:07.640 --> 21:10.435
Wow. It's so depressing.
Just look at him.

21:10.518 --> 21:11.936
I suddenly get why my dad
used to say,

21:12.020 --> 21:13.521
"I'm not gonna punish you.

21:13.605 --> 21:15.064
You've punished yourself enough."

21:15.148 --> 21:18.443
My dad likes to punish us
while we punish ourselves.

21:18.526 --> 21:21.946
I am a complete loser.
[sighs]

21:22.030 --> 21:23.323
You know, I was thinking

21:23.406 --> 21:26.785
that this kind of
looked better on you.

21:26.868 --> 21:29.120
You work it like a wookiee.
