02:50.628 --> 02:52.463
No. I didn't see anything.

03:27.457 --> 03:28.291
Keep moving.

03:29.292 --> 03:30.335
Let's go! Let's go!

05:34.625 --> 05:37.128
Field Marshal Kesselring is here, General.

05:42.050 --> 05:43.343
A problem, Eberhard?

05:44.052 --> 05:45.219
No, Field Marshal.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.849
Thank God you're a better general
than you are aÂ liar.

05:50.933 --> 05:53.603
I have six kilometers
of open ground to cover.

05:53.686 --> 05:56.272
Six kilometers under enemy artillery.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.691
But only two to reach his lines.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.903
And he's proven a timid foe, Eberhard.

06:01.986 --> 06:04.947
One who's been sitting there for weeks,
unwilling to attack.

06:05.907 --> 06:06.866
Reach his lines

06:06.949 --> 06:09.327
and he will not sacrifice himself
to stop you.

09:33.197 --> 09:34.615
Son of a bitch.

09:36.409 --> 09:37.994
Let's go! Let's go!

09:50.756 --> 09:51.632
Let's go!

15:05.487 --> 15:06.906
Get the wounded!

17:49.359 --> 17:52.529
There is only one company left
on the Via Anziate, Herr General.

17:52.613 --> 17:54.698
They are down to quarter strength

17:54.782 --> 17:57.034
and there is nothing between them
and Anzio.

17:57.701 --> 17:59.203
Prepare your men, Colonel.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.875
I saw you talking with their commander.

18:04.958 --> 18:06.376
Yes, sir, Herr General.

18:06.460 --> 18:08.629
I offered him the opportunity
to surrender.

18:08.712 --> 18:10.297
And what was his response?

18:10.964 --> 18:14.176
He asked
if I knew anything about Oklahoma.

18:14.259 --> 18:19.056
When I said no,
he said I was about to learn a lot.

19:33.589 --> 19:35.174
Be brave, boys!

19:40.929 --> 19:42.181
We can do it!

19:51.523 --> 19:52.691
Now!

19:54.401 --> 19:57.070
Attack!

20:40.155 --> 20:45.035
With me! Forward!

23:19.272 --> 23:20.857
Good. Good.

24:03.066 --> 24:05.402
It's okay. It's okay.

25:13.887 --> 25:15.138
Understood.

30:00.715 --> 30:02.425
Attention! Enemy!

30:56.729 --> 30:58.439
Come on! Hands up!

37:54.939 --> 37:56.482
Hey, are you okay?

37:57.525 --> 37:58.859
Do you need help?

37:59.443 --> 38:00.278
No.

38:03.322 --> 38:04.156
No.

38:06.909 --> 38:08.119
You are bleeding.

38:08.953 --> 38:10.037
Let me help you!

38:25.136 --> 38:25.970
Americans!

38:26.971 --> 38:29.056
Get up! Get up!

38:53.581 --> 38:57.084
Armin, Armin! Over there!

41:44.460 --> 41:46.295
He's so heavy. Help me, please!
