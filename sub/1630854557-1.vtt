00:12.041 --> 00:15.750
Tonight, if there were
a moon, it'd be full to the brim

00:15.833 --> 00:20.041
with pure anticipation for this
historic moment in football.

00:20.125 --> 00:21.000
Or soccer.

00:21.083 --> 00:23.583
But in most places, it's football.

00:23.666 --> 00:27.916
But no matter what you call the game,
it all starts with a ball.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.208
And a person.

00:29.291 --> 00:30.458
And their foot.

00:30.541 --> 00:35.916
This nail-biter comes down to Zlatan,
in the final game before the All-Star Cup.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.625
I'm Rob Stone.

00:37.708 --> 00:40.250
Will Zlatan make it happen?

00:41.166 --> 00:43.875
Zlatan always makes it happen.

00:43.958 --> 00:47.333
Was he… Was he pointing at me?

00:48.333 --> 00:51.333
Yes, I'm pointing at you, Rob Stone.

00:51.416 --> 00:54.125
How are you even hearing me and--

00:54.208 --> 00:56.666
Dude, concentrate on the penalty shot.

00:56.750 --> 00:58.791
What? This shot?

01:00.916 --> 01:03.750
Zlatan shoots. And Zlatan…

01:07.125 --> 01:09.125
…scores!

01:11.291 --> 01:13.833
Now that is good football. Or soccer.

01:13.916 --> 01:16.666
-But mostly football. I'm Rob Stone.

01:19.250 --> 01:20.916
In a mere 24 hours,

01:21.000 --> 01:25.166
someone will go home with
that prestigious, shiny All-Star Cup.

01:25.250 --> 01:28.708
Until then, fans will be asking themselves

01:28.791 --> 01:32.791
who will be named
the All-Star Cup All-Star

01:32.875 --> 01:36.541
of all All-Stars of all time?

01:36.625 --> 01:37.750
-That's easy.
-Huh?

01:37.833 --> 01:40.583
It will be… Ah! Zlatan!

01:40.666 --> 01:42.666
Spoiler alert! Aha!

01:42.750 --> 01:45.000
As I was trying to say--

01:45.083 --> 01:46.833
Zlatan!

01:47.625 --> 01:49.250
Okay!

01:49.333 --> 01:50.833
Zlatan!

01:55.166 --> 01:57.750
Let's find out what soccer fans think.

01:57.833 --> 02:00.250
Weird Al Yankovic! What's your take?

02:04.666 --> 02:09.000
I think the All-Star Cup All-Star
of all All-Stars of all time will be

02:09.083 --> 02:10.083
me!

02:12.583 --> 02:16.041
Oh, that's rich.
And by rich, I mean hilarious and dumb.

02:16.125 --> 02:17.375
Hey, hear me out.

02:17.458 --> 02:22.541
Wouldn't I be the All-Star Cup All-Star
of all All-Stars of all time if I were to,

02:22.625 --> 02:24.708
oh, I don't know,

02:24.791 --> 02:30.250
borrow a teensy bit of soccer skills
from each player using advanced genetics?

02:30.750 --> 02:33.000
Weird Al knows advanced genetics?

02:33.083 --> 02:35.500
Know it? It's one of my doctorates!

02:35.583 --> 02:39.583
How else could I have come up
with "I Think I'm a Clone Now"?

02:39.666 --> 02:41.875
How, Rob? How could I have?

02:43.791 --> 02:44.625
Weird Al?

02:44.708 --> 02:46.083
Yes, Rob Stone?

02:46.583 --> 02:48.833
Are you a mad scientist?

02:48.916 --> 02:51.083
I mean…

02:51.166 --> 02:53.333
Who would say yes to that, Rob?

02:53.416 --> 02:56.541
Would a mad scientist
actually say yes to that?

02:56.625 --> 02:59.083
Well, you're not saying
you aren't a mad scientist.

02:59.166 --> 03:04.041
What I'm saying is, Weird Al can do
anything he sets his mind to.

03:04.125 --> 03:05.208
Observe.

03:05.291 --> 03:07.958
This free kick, into that net.

03:11.833 --> 03:15.458
Ow! Ow, man!

03:18.041 --> 03:19.708
There we go!

03:20.208 --> 03:22.416
And now time for some fan commentary.

03:22.500 --> 03:24.875
Hey, you, tall person in a trench coat.

03:24.958 --> 03:26.958
-We're spotted.
-He's coming!

03:27.041 --> 03:31.500
Who do you think will be named
the All-Star of all All-Stars?

03:31.583 --> 03:32.541
Megan! Megan!

03:32.625 --> 03:34.125
-It's Ronaldo.
-Megan!

03:34.208 --> 03:36.291
-Quit punching.
-Hey!

03:36.375 --> 03:38.666
And we're done here!

03:38.750 --> 03:41.625
We'll see you at the All-Star game.

03:41.708 --> 03:43.208
For now, my name is--

03:43.291 --> 03:44.750
Rob Stone, think fast!

03:46.041 --> 03:48.791
-We lost the coat!
-Also losing balance.

03:48.875 --> 03:53.041
We are not losing my chance
to get a selfie with Megan Rapinoe!

03:53.125 --> 03:55.250
Nautai, not the time!

03:55.333 --> 03:57.125
- Whoa!

03:57.208 --> 03:58.958
-We're going down!

04:01.000 --> 04:02.750
We're gonna get caught.

04:02.833 --> 04:03.958
Quiet, Palio.

04:04.041 --> 04:05.625
Rapinoe, where you at?

04:05.708 --> 04:07.708
Nautai, not the time!

04:09.666 --> 04:11.083
I think not!

04:12.666 --> 04:14.416
-Hmm.
-What was that for, Zana?

04:15.375 --> 04:16.791
Goalie's instinct.

04:16.875 --> 04:20.750
We should make this fast.
Security's gonna come soon.

04:20.833 --> 04:24.041
Mama needs a Megan selfie,
let's not waste a second.

04:24.125 --> 04:26.083
Is that who I think it is?

04:26.166 --> 04:28.583
-Amazing! This can't be real!
-What?

04:32.833 --> 04:34.416
I think not!

04:35.125 --> 04:37.208
Ooh. Whoops.

04:37.291 --> 04:39.125
You blocked Zlatan.

04:39.208 --> 04:40.833
-Zana, I'll miss you.
-We're dead!

04:41.416 --> 04:42.958
Goalie's instinct?

04:44.375 --> 04:47.958
You got talent.
Not Zlatan's talent, but still talent.

04:48.041 --> 04:51.500
Don't feel bad though,
no one has Zlatan's talent.

04:51.583 --> 04:52.458
That is true.

04:52.541 --> 04:54.041
-Nautai does.
-What?

04:54.125 --> 04:56.833
At least when it comes to juggling, which,

04:56.916 --> 05:00.291
from this display,
appears to be Zlatan's kryptonite.

05:00.375 --> 05:01.875
Oh, snap!

05:01.958 --> 05:04.791
I propose a juggle-off.

05:04.875 --> 05:06.416
Double snap.

05:06.500 --> 05:08.708
The confidence I admire.

05:08.791 --> 05:12.708
But Zlatan is a pro.
A pro does not juggle against a kid.

05:13.291 --> 05:15.833
Oh, you mean against a kid
you're afraid will beat you?

05:17.166 --> 05:20.833
Then again,
I'm currently off the clock, which means

05:20.916 --> 05:23.000
Zlatan is happy to trounce anyone.

05:23.083 --> 05:26.875
And he will trounce you.
Come on, Tai, be reasonable.

05:26.958 --> 05:28.375
Reasonable?

05:28.458 --> 05:29.375
Not my thing.

05:29.458 --> 05:32.291
All right. Make space, people.
Juggle-off on.

05:32.375 --> 05:37.125
Allow Zlatan to show you
how to juggle like Zlatan.

06:07.083 --> 06:09.041
-Zlatan rules!
-Yeah!

06:09.125 --> 06:11.375
Uh, wow, tough act to follow.

06:11.458 --> 06:13.416
Nautai can always back out.

06:13.500 --> 06:16.041
Ah, but Nautai never will.

06:16.125 --> 06:18.375
Can I get a "juggle-off on"?

06:18.458 --> 06:20.458
Technically it was never off.

06:20.541 --> 06:22.500
Just say, "Juggle-off on."

06:22.583 --> 06:25.750
I can turn it off, then turn it on.
Would that work?

06:25.833 --> 06:27.458
Juggle-off on!

06:42.250 --> 06:43.500
-Nautai!
-Nice!

06:43.583 --> 06:48.125
Zlatan is impressed, but also curious
how you four got in here.

06:48.208 --> 06:49.625
We snuck in to meet you.

06:49.708 --> 06:52.916
We're a street football team.
We've been saving for tickets.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.291
It's not easy though,
we live in the trailers by the old dump.

06:56.375 --> 06:58.791
Down the Dead River from the new dump.

06:58.875 --> 07:02.125
The point is, we started a business
so we could buy tickets.

07:02.208 --> 07:05.125
And it took off,
thanks to being inspired by you.

07:05.208 --> 07:08.166
And Megan!
By the by, do you guys hang out?

07:08.250 --> 07:09.708
Trying to get a selfie.

07:09.791 --> 07:11.750
Nautai, not the time.

07:11.833 --> 07:14.708
Call us the Creature Catchers.

07:15.291 --> 07:16.291
"Pest control"?

07:16.375 --> 07:20.916
Highest-rated pest control on Yelp.
Five stars. Whoop-whoop!

07:21.000 --> 07:24.500
We run toward the stuff
everyone else runs away from.

07:24.583 --> 07:26.333
That's our slogan. Woot.

07:26.416 --> 07:28.000
And this is our commercial.

07:28.083 --> 07:30.708
Oh, what? Gah!

07:31.291 --> 07:33.666
That is a rabbit's tongue. Ugh.

07:33.750 --> 07:36.166
And what are those zappy things?

07:36.250 --> 07:37.958
Homemade electro-<i>bolas.</i>

07:39.333 --> 07:43.833
And those? What is that?
Let me guess, homemade electro-balls?

07:43.916 --> 07:45.875
Homemade stun balls.

07:47.375 --> 07:50.625
Your every Yelp star has been earned,
my friends.

07:50.708 --> 07:55.250
Zlatan's never seen anyone fight off
a rabid raccoon using a back-heel.

07:55.333 --> 07:57.791
-Zlatan likes it!
-All you, O'Dang.

07:57.875 --> 08:02.500
I got inspired by your back-heel goal
against Bastia in 2013.

08:02.583 --> 08:06.958
Seems like soccer's
more than just a game for you.

08:07.041 --> 08:09.958
We bring soccer
into every aspect of our lives.

08:10.041 --> 08:12.291
Makes it hard to go to libraries.

08:12.375 --> 08:13.708
I can imagine.

08:13.791 --> 08:16.666
Only a great team could have caught
a rabid skunk.

08:16.750 --> 08:19.875
Teamwork is how you avoid
getting sprayed by stink.

08:19.958 --> 08:24.083
Like playing against Ronaldo.
Anyway, you're good at what you do.

08:25.500 --> 08:26.750
Yes, yes, yes!

08:26.833 --> 08:31.041
Or maybe you're incredibly stupid
and very lucky.

08:31.125 --> 08:34.125
But either way,
you've earned those tickets.

08:34.208 --> 08:36.791
Tickets sold out fast,
so we're out of luck.

08:36.875 --> 08:38.750
Good thing I got four extra.

08:39.333 --> 08:40.791
They are all yours,

08:40.875 --> 08:45.083
if you promise you got my back
with any creatures that need catching.

08:52.291 --> 08:53.875
Hello?

08:54.875 --> 08:56.416
-Deal!
-Deal!

08:56.500 --> 08:57.625
Yes, yes!

08:57.708 --> 08:59.583
Thank you so much.

08:59.666 --> 09:04.291
I mean, all we wanted to do is say thanks
and give you a coupon. And now this?

09:04.375 --> 09:05.375
Ooh.

09:06.125 --> 09:09.958
Zlatan didn't get to the top
by turning down coupons.

09:10.041 --> 09:13.458
I'll get the tickets.
Back in two minutes. Don't move.

09:14.041 --> 09:16.333
-I can't even!
-An itch on my arm!

09:16.416 --> 09:17.708
Don't move!

09:20.208 --> 09:22.916
Nothing Zlatan likes more
than coming through

09:23.000 --> 09:24.541
on a promise to his fans.

09:24.625 --> 09:27.791
And not getting distracted at all.

09:27.875 --> 09:28.916
What's that?

09:31.375 --> 09:33.791
A present! To Zlatan?

09:33.875 --> 09:37.250
"Open me." I sure will, mystery gift.

09:37.833 --> 09:40.291
Oh! I hope it's a jetpack.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.791
Eh, already got one.

09:45.875 --> 09:49.000
Now, a jetpack, there's a mystery gift.

09:49.083 --> 09:50.416
Ah…

09:50.500 --> 09:52.000
They all want selfies.

09:52.083 --> 09:54.500
Gotta make my ponytail pretty for selfies.

09:54.583 --> 09:56.208
-What the…

10:03.375 --> 10:04.541
Ew!

10:07.375 --> 10:09.708
-Was that Zlatan?
-That sounded bad.

10:09.791 --> 10:12.750
-I'll just itch real quick, yeah?
-Don't move!

10:24.916 --> 10:26.125
Oh.

10:26.208 --> 10:28.625
A cutie little slug baby.

10:28.708 --> 10:31.375
What's your name, sluggy baby?

10:33.458 --> 10:36.291
Lovely! Is that a family name?

10:37.666 --> 10:38.666
Slug baby?

10:44.000 --> 10:47.041
-O'Dang, wait!
-He said don't move! Stay frozen!

10:47.125 --> 10:48.541
Can't hear you, running away!

10:48.625 --> 10:50.250
That's better.

10:50.333 --> 10:52.000
Zlatan! You all right?

10:52.083 --> 10:55.500
Sluggy? You there? Sluggy?

11:01.583 --> 11:04.916
Phew! Slug baby, come on out.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.666
Zlatan's taking you
to the slug baby orphanage.

11:08.750 --> 11:10.208
Or I can squash you.

11:10.291 --> 11:12.250
Your choice, tough guy.

11:27.875 --> 11:29.291
Zlatan, you okay?

11:29.375 --> 11:32.458
Stay in there,
I'm hunting a green glowy thing.

11:36.125 --> 11:37.333
Slug!

11:37.416 --> 11:40.041
Yeah, exactly, a slug!

11:40.125 --> 11:41.208
No, behind you!

11:46.916 --> 11:47.916
Zlatan!

11:48.000 --> 11:50.166
Hey. Get off my ponytail!

11:50.250 --> 11:54.375
It's my best feature,
after my talent and face!

11:57.125 --> 11:58.291
Get off!

12:00.875 --> 12:03.666
No! Do not, worm!

12:09.250 --> 12:11.291
What's happening?

12:11.375 --> 12:14.583
No, this was a new uniform!

12:14.666 --> 12:16.833
No. My lucky socks!

12:21.625 --> 12:23.000
No…

12:29.333 --> 12:31.041
What happened?

12:31.125 --> 12:34.166
Uh, there was an incident.

12:35.875 --> 12:38.791
What kind of incident causes that?

12:38.875 --> 12:44.250
What kind?
The mutant Zlatan kind!

12:49.166 --> 12:53.083
Now, before he became a mutant, did he…

12:53.166 --> 12:54.833
Did he give you the tickets?

12:55.416 --> 12:56.500
No.

12:56.583 --> 13:00.375
No!

13:33.166 --> 13:35.708
-Get the goo dripping.
-I'm getting it.

13:35.791 --> 13:36.833
-Say cheese!
-Yes.

13:36.916 --> 13:39.125
A neon slug hatched out of a soccer ball,

13:39.208 --> 13:41.541
then turned Zlatan
into a rampaging mutant.

13:42.541 --> 13:43.875
-Hello?
-Cheese!

13:44.625 --> 13:47.250
So 911 hung up. We're on our own.

13:47.833 --> 13:50.625
Well, guess we're heading home.

13:50.708 --> 13:55.625
We promised Zlatan we'd have his back
with creatures that needed catching.

13:55.708 --> 13:59.000
Turns out, he's the creature.

13:59.083 --> 14:01.500
Oh, I'm all for keeping promises.

14:01.583 --> 14:05.500
But I'm also all for
not getting killed by Mutant Zlatan.

14:05.583 --> 14:09.708
I hear that, Palio. Alone,
each of us would definitely get killed.

14:09.791 --> 14:12.250
But remember what Zlatan said?

14:12.333 --> 14:15.083
We catch creatures. We play football.

14:15.166 --> 14:18.208
If there was ever anyone
to do this, it's us.

14:19.916 --> 14:23.750
-I know you're scared. I'm scared.
-I'm scared too.

14:23.833 --> 14:24.791
I'm fine.

14:24.875 --> 14:28.291
We might be scared,
but at least we're scared together,

14:28.375 --> 14:32.250
as a team,
and we're gonna find Zlatan as a team.

14:32.333 --> 14:36.500
We might get brutally slaughtered,
but it'll be a team slaughter.

14:36.583 --> 14:37.708
Good speech.

14:38.666 --> 14:41.458
-How are we gonna find him?

14:41.541 --> 14:46.583
How hard can it be to find a rampaging,
mutated, neon-green football legend?

14:57.333 --> 15:01.750
Mutant Zlatan smash you all!

15:01.833 --> 15:03.791
Let's suit up and get out there.

15:03.875 --> 15:07.208
Before we risk our lives,
can we get a five-second soccer break?

15:07.291 --> 15:08.708
Please?

15:08.791 --> 15:11.708
You know I want to,
but there's no time. We've gotta suit up.

15:11.791 --> 15:15.208
Come on, five seconds.
I need a recharge. Please?

15:15.291 --> 15:17.666
Hey, keep it down out there!

15:18.791 --> 15:21.750
Just a quiet five-second soccer break?

15:21.833 --> 15:25.541
Nautai, Mutant Zlatan is on the loose.
This is no time to--

15:25.625 --> 15:27.708
-Hey!
-Watch this!

15:27.791 --> 15:30.125
-Bam! GOAT.

15:30.791 --> 15:33.083
I'll give you a GOAT.

15:42.958 --> 15:45.291
Hey, keep it down out there!

15:50.208 --> 15:51.375
He's big.

15:51.458 --> 15:52.958
He's terrifying.

15:53.041 --> 15:53.916
He stinks!

15:54.000 --> 15:55.250
Let's go get him!

15:55.333 --> 15:58.083
-Cue the suit-up music.
-We're suiting up?

15:58.166 --> 15:59.250
Yeah! Suit up!

15:59.333 --> 16:01.375
-Sweet suit-up music.

16:01.458 --> 16:03.750
Ooh, these color cards are new.

16:03.833 --> 16:06.041
Bright and cheerful. I like!

16:08.458 --> 16:09.875
O'Dang, why all the racket?

16:11.875 --> 16:14.416
-Palio, see you next fall!

16:14.500 --> 16:16.750
-Ooh, love the new sneeze guard, Zana.

16:16.833 --> 16:18.833
I buttoned my sleeves together!

16:18.916 --> 16:20.125
Vintage Palio.

16:20.208 --> 16:21.125
Let's go!

16:22.250 --> 16:23.833
Creature Catchers!

16:23.916 --> 16:26.625
-Did I mess up?
-You said it before you jumped.

16:26.708 --> 16:28.833
-It's as you jump.
-You say it and then jump.

16:34.708 --> 16:37.750
Stupid clothes. Stupid rope!

16:37.833 --> 16:41.416
-How about you keep it down!

16:42.458 --> 16:44.083
-He's close.

16:44.166 --> 16:45.541
I can smell him.

16:45.625 --> 16:47.291
-Oh, no.
-Bingo!

16:47.375 --> 16:49.208
Oh, please. After you.

16:49.291 --> 16:52.625
<i>There have been sightings</i>
<i>of a rampaging Zlatan,</i>

16:52.708 --> 16:56.041
<i>far more glowy and green than usual.</i>

16:56.125 --> 16:58.416
<i>We can only speculate as to why.</i>

16:58.500 --> 17:02.541
<i>My money is on superpowers</i>
<i>from outer space.</i>

17:03.166 --> 17:06.541
<i>Let's go to the phones.</i>
<i>Caller X, what's your take?</i>

17:06.625 --> 17:09.666
My take is the bad guy is a genius.

17:10.166 --> 17:12.125
<i>You've talked to the bad guy?</i>

17:12.208 --> 17:13.750
<i>Who is it, Caller X?</i>

17:13.833 --> 17:17.208
It's me, Rob. Obviously, I'm the bad guy.

17:17.291 --> 17:21.416
I'm calling with a voice modulator
and boasting in a coy manner.

17:21.500 --> 17:25.083
Who else could it possibly be
other than a bad guy?

17:25.166 --> 17:27.125
Who, Rob, who?

17:27.208 --> 17:30.708
<i>Hey, no need</i>
<i>to get snippy, Caller X.</i>

17:30.791 --> 17:33.583
If the bad guy wants to snip, he'll snip!

17:33.666 --> 17:35.000
Snip, snip, snip!

17:35.083 --> 17:37.250
<i>Caller X mutated Zlatan?</i>

17:37.333 --> 17:41.375
That's right.
Zlatan won't be the last All-Star either.

17:41.458 --> 17:44.708
Soon, I'll have talent
from every All-Star.

17:52.291 --> 17:55.416
My voice modulator!

17:56.500 --> 17:59.916
As I was saying…

18:00.708 --> 18:05.666
<i>Say what you will about Caller X,</i>
<i>but that is a mighty fine evil laugh.</i>

18:05.750 --> 18:06.750
<i>I'm Rob Stone.</i>

18:08.791 --> 18:11.250
Rapinoe moves in on the goal,
victory in sight.

18:18.041 --> 18:21.250
McCready isn't making a move
as Rapinoe shoots.

18:23.541 --> 18:27.166
Oh! Last-minute steal by McCready!

18:27.250 --> 18:30.250
Rapinoe has been defeated by her own pet!

18:30.333 --> 18:32.000
Unbelievable!

18:32.666 --> 18:34.541
-You're so cute.

18:34.625 --> 18:37.041
Uh, rematch comin' right at ya.

18:40.333 --> 18:41.625
Huh? Huh?

18:42.541 --> 18:43.625
Oh.

18:43.708 --> 18:46.791
It's a mystery gift! Maybe it's a jetpack!

18:49.000 --> 18:52.625
Soccer ball? Ugh, I already got one.

18:56.833 --> 18:58.291
Give me that. Stop--

19:06.416 --> 19:07.250
Nice try.

19:07.333 --> 19:10.166
You wanna distract me
so you can win tug-o-war.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.083
It ain't happening, buster.

19:12.166 --> 19:16.875
Bark all you want, won't convince me
to turn around. Not gonna happen.

19:16.958 --> 19:18.291
-McCready?

19:25.166 --> 19:27.791
Uh, McCready? McCready!

19:37.833 --> 19:40.833
-What even is that?

19:42.791 --> 19:44.750
Some guard dog you are.

19:49.375 --> 19:52.250
Where'd you go, little green guy?

20:05.500 --> 20:09.250
Ugh, this job should be easy.
It's, like, made for us!

20:09.333 --> 20:11.166
I can't believe we lost him.

20:11.250 --> 20:14.916
It's Zlatan!
And you're surprised he's beating us?

20:15.000 --> 20:17.166
-No sign of him.
-Us either.

20:17.250 --> 20:20.416
This makes no sense.
He's gotta be around here somewhere.

20:29.375 --> 20:31.375
Huh?

20:35.291 --> 20:37.166
Hm. Suspicious billboard.

20:37.250 --> 20:38.416
We've got to keep looking.

20:38.500 --> 20:41.375
I vote for a 30-second sit break.

20:46.916 --> 20:48.833
-Come on, Tai.
-Horrible.

20:53.916 --> 20:55.708
Oops. It was an accident.

20:56.291 --> 20:58.666
Also, it wasn't real.

20:58.750 --> 21:01.666
Nautai, why keep
that inflated all the time?

21:01.750 --> 21:05.333
First rule of whoopee cushion,
keep it inflated all the time.

21:05.416 --> 21:08.958
Huh. I thought it's
never talk about whoopee cushion.

21:09.041 --> 21:11.333
-That's the third.
-What's the second?

21:11.416 --> 21:12.791
I've already said too much.

21:14.208 --> 21:16.708
Creature Catchers are
currently out on an emergency.

21:18.166 --> 21:21.666
Did you just say a glowing green slug?

21:21.750 --> 21:24.291
From a football? Inside a present?

21:24.916 --> 21:27.083
-We're on our way!
-Do we have to?

21:28.708 --> 21:33.750
Whatever that was, got to make sure
it happens zero more times.

21:33.833 --> 21:35.166
Must call stadium.

21:35.708 --> 21:38.125
Find out who sent sluggy present.

21:41.791 --> 21:43.500
Hey. Welcome to my joke shop.

21:43.583 --> 21:44.958
Smell this flower.

21:45.041 --> 21:47.541
-Ah! Got you. It's a snake.

21:47.625 --> 21:50.250
This is no time for jokes.
I need to use your phone.

21:50.333 --> 21:52.166
Ooh, a joke phone?

21:52.250 --> 21:53.625
A real phone.

21:53.708 --> 21:54.583
Nope.

21:54.666 --> 21:57.708
-But how about a whoopee cushion, eh?

21:57.791 --> 22:00.583
No! Not again!

22:00.666 --> 22:02.708
Hey, no need to mutate, buddy.

22:04.500 --> 22:08.500
Hey, watch it!
That Fabergé vomit is vintage!

22:11.291 --> 22:14.458
Must keep control.

22:16.541 --> 22:20.000
Cannot fully mutate!

22:20.083 --> 22:20.916
Pinky!

22:21.000 --> 22:24.750
At least some part of me is still normal.

22:25.250 --> 22:30.291
Got to find out who sent me that present
and then punch them in the face!

22:34.458 --> 22:40.416
-Bouncy. Bouncy. Bouncy. Bouncy.

22:42.208 --> 22:46.708
Okay, Nautai. No bigs.
Just your all-time hero.

22:46.791 --> 22:47.791
You good, Tai?

22:47.875 --> 22:49.708
Nope, I have to scream.

22:49.791 --> 22:50.958
Please don't.

22:56.958 --> 22:58.250
Megan needs us.

22:58.333 --> 23:00.083
And Nautai needs a selfie!

23:03.541 --> 23:04.708
Hey, I'm over here.

23:09.041 --> 23:12.583
Is it a talking statue?
Are you a talking statue?

23:12.666 --> 23:14.625
No. Over here!

23:19.916 --> 23:22.666
Can I get a selfie?

23:22.750 --> 23:24.458
Nautai, not the time.

23:24.541 --> 23:27.833
Yeah, what she said.
I'm hiding from a mutant slug.

23:27.916 --> 23:30.458
Get out of here, it's too dangerous.

23:30.541 --> 23:32.083
This thing's out for blood.

23:33.750 --> 23:36.416
I'm waiting for
highly capable creature catchers.

23:36.500 --> 23:37.708
We are them.

23:38.208 --> 23:40.250
You're highly capable?

23:40.333 --> 23:43.333
Don't worry.
We got this all taken care…

23:43.416 --> 23:44.375
Slug!

23:56.708 --> 23:58.708
Ah, so annoying.

24:00.458 --> 24:03.750
Careful, it might look like
a regular, slow slug,

24:03.833 --> 24:07.083
but I assure you it moves very--

24:07.750 --> 24:09.958
Get that slug off of there, stat.

24:10.041 --> 24:11.458
Do not let it latch on.

24:11.541 --> 24:13.458
Is it latching on? Did it latch on?

24:13.541 --> 24:14.791
It latched on.

24:16.333 --> 24:20.208
Don't worry,
I'll rip that slug off and stomp it good.

24:26.875 --> 24:28.333
Can I get a selfie?

24:28.416 --> 24:30.291
Not the time!

24:30.375 --> 24:32.125
-She's really upset.

24:32.208 --> 24:33.583
-I think so!

24:40.500 --> 24:42.291
Ew.

24:42.375 --> 24:43.666
Still a fan though.

24:51.708 --> 24:52.750
Come on!

24:59.791 --> 25:00.625
Yah!

25:02.125 --> 25:03.000
Yah!

25:05.500 --> 25:06.666
She almost killed us.

25:06.750 --> 25:08.291
-You okay, Tai?
-Let's go!

25:08.375 --> 25:09.625
Okay, guess she's fine.

25:19.291 --> 25:22.250
Not only is he among
the great artists of our time,

25:22.333 --> 25:27.208
he's also a highly respected brain surgeon
and a die-hard fan of soccer-football.

25:27.750 --> 25:31.291
I'm proud to dedicate
this new hospital to the esteemed

25:31.375 --> 25:33.041
Dr. Weird Al Yankovic.

25:35.750 --> 25:38.333
Mwah. Hey, y'all.
I'd love to give a speech,

25:38.416 --> 25:42.791
but we have a trauma patient
who needs immediate attention.

25:46.791 --> 25:48.708
Pinky!

25:52.041 --> 25:54.125
Don't worry, pinky. I save you.

25:57.791 --> 25:59.291
-Ah…

25:59.375 --> 26:03.541
Nothing like performing a nice,
delicate seven-hour surgery.

26:07.041 --> 26:09.291
You're the best!

26:09.375 --> 26:10.500
Thank you. Thank you.

26:10.583 --> 26:12.958
I am happy to accept this research grant

26:13.041 --> 26:16.458
on behalf of my wonderful,
talented and humble self.

26:16.541 --> 26:20.166
I'm in the middle of some
mind-blowing genetic advancements

26:20.250 --> 26:24.666
that will simply blow your minds!

26:26.583 --> 26:29.666
Which I'm too busy with
to waste time talking to you people.

26:29.750 --> 26:31.333
-Ow!

26:31.416 --> 26:33.375
Give me that oversized check!

26:36.583 --> 26:39.833
And now the Mayor,
Dr. Weird Al Yankovic!

26:39.916 --> 26:41.375
Trusty shears, please.

26:41.458 --> 26:45.500
I declare this Spatula Emporium
open for business!

26:45.583 --> 26:48.500
Spatulas! I love spatulas!

26:48.583 --> 26:49.583
I love spatulas!

26:49.666 --> 26:50.791
Hmm.

26:50.875 --> 26:55.875
Mayor Weird Al is a lot nicer
than scientist Weird Al.

27:04.458 --> 27:06.875
Huh?

27:06.958 --> 27:08.208
Mm.

27:09.791 --> 27:12.666
-Hey, Zlatan! Stop!

27:15.416 --> 27:17.666
A talking fire hydrant?

27:17.750 --> 27:18.791
No!

27:18.875 --> 27:21.666
A talking hat on a fire hydrant?

27:21.750 --> 27:23.250
No, it's me.

27:24.541 --> 27:26.708
Up here, on your head.

27:26.791 --> 27:28.625
Ponytail?!

27:28.708 --> 27:31.583
That's my name, don't wear it out.

27:31.666 --> 27:33.416
Since when do you talk?

27:33.500 --> 27:35.625
Since that mutant slug bit me.

27:35.708 --> 27:39.333
He was supposed to latch onto your head
but he latched onto me.

27:39.416 --> 27:43.125
Now I can talk and feel and sing!

27:44.125 --> 27:46.916
I got bad vibes
about you going to Weird Al.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
Allow me to explain through song!

27:49.083 --> 27:52.375
Nah, nah, we don't have budget
for musical number.

27:52.458 --> 27:56.875
Look! Ponytail, I know you're tied tight,
but loosen up a little!

27:56.958 --> 28:01.333
Do what you do best.
Hang around, look pretty.

28:01.416 --> 28:05.458
That is what I do best.
Still, you gotta trust me, Zlatan.

28:05.541 --> 28:08.666
Ah. I need to find out
what's going on with this guy.

28:08.750 --> 28:12.375
Now pipe down,
or I'll make you into a bun.

28:12.458 --> 28:15.541
Ah! A man bun! Anything but that!

28:18.291 --> 28:22.250
Yeesh, tall building.
I ain't so good with heights myself.

28:22.875 --> 28:24.875
-Uh?

28:27.333 --> 28:29.750
-Oh. Whoa.

28:56.875 --> 28:58.958
Ah!

29:05.250 --> 29:09.250
Hey! Get your green, glowy paws
off my snickerdoodles!

29:11.125 --> 29:14.208
-Huh. She caught herself.
-Mission accomplished.

29:20.583 --> 29:22.458
Mission unaccomplished.

29:27.125 --> 29:28.958
Can we ever run away?

29:30.541 --> 29:33.500
Can I get a selfie?

29:33.583 --> 29:36.625
Nautai, not the time!

29:36.708 --> 29:38.166
She's not even here.

29:38.250 --> 29:41.416
Sorry. I just… I love her so much.

29:41.500 --> 29:43.750
Even as a rampaging slug mutant.

29:43.833 --> 29:46.916
Everybody, keep your eyes peeled
for two glowing green giants.

29:50.500 --> 29:51.333
Huh?

29:54.958 --> 29:56.458
Don't worry, we got this.

29:56.541 --> 29:58.750
We've been in way scarier situations.

29:59.250 --> 30:00.083
Like what?

30:00.666 --> 30:04.875
Remember when we landed a plane?
It was scary, but we did it!

30:04.958 --> 30:07.875
O'Dang, that was a dream you had.

30:07.958 --> 30:09.875
But still, we did it!

30:13.875 --> 30:15.416
Ew!

30:17.250 --> 30:20.250
-Come on!
-Ew!

30:24.666 --> 30:27.625
-Can I get a selfie?
-Still not the time!

30:28.208 --> 30:30.875
Zana, Palio. Ready stun sticks.

30:33.583 --> 30:38.125
What? You can't stun-stick Megan.
She's unstunnable!

30:38.208 --> 30:39.583
We'll find out.

30:39.666 --> 30:43.416
Ready, aim, fire!

30:54.250 --> 30:55.083
Tai!

30:56.791 --> 30:58.166
You got this, Tai!

31:00.375 --> 31:02.375
Come on! Throw it!

31:02.916 --> 31:04.458
I…

31:06.041 --> 31:07.750
I can't…

31:08.375 --> 31:10.875
I can't stun-bomb my hero!

31:15.958 --> 31:17.208
Nautai, run!

31:17.291 --> 31:19.583
-Get out of there!
-What?

31:23.166 --> 31:24.041
Oops.

31:50.625 --> 31:52.666
Uh, don't think I'll bend that way!

31:52.750 --> 31:55.083
-Eeh.
-Oh.

32:00.333 --> 32:01.875
Uh, uh…

32:06.166 --> 32:07.500
Hey! Whoa!

32:13.250 --> 32:15.541
Boy, am I glad the first rule
of whoopee cushion

32:15.625 --> 32:17.791
is keep it inflated at all times.

32:17.875 --> 32:20.708
-Can I know the second rule yet?
-Yes, my child.

32:21.541 --> 32:23.291
Always keep a spare.

32:29.291 --> 32:30.333
Deploy it again!

32:41.125 --> 32:44.541
Stop hitting the whoopee!

32:46.458 --> 32:51.166
It appears the sonic quality
of the deployment triggers the mutation.

32:51.250 --> 32:52.666
-Oh.
-English, please.

32:52.750 --> 32:55.916
Squeeze the whoopee, save the All-Stars.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.375
Got it. The whoopee cushion is go.

33:07.083 --> 33:08.083
Oops.

33:13.375 --> 33:15.666
Present came from here.

33:16.666 --> 33:21.625
If Mayor Weird Al did this,
then he can reverse it!

33:21.708 --> 33:23.333
-But I won't.
-Huh?

33:23.416 --> 33:27.916
Hello, Zlatan,
my favorite mutant slug baby of all!

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
Zlatan is nobody's slug, baby!

33:31.083 --> 33:34.416
Now spill the beans,
Doctor-Mayor-Doctor Weird Al.

33:34.500 --> 33:39.750
Why am I a mutant?!

33:39.833 --> 33:44.750
I found an enzyme
that makes talent tangible and extractable

33:44.833 --> 33:47.250
with only a single side effect.

33:47.333 --> 33:49.541
A hideous mutation?

33:49.625 --> 33:51.708
-Let me finish!

33:51.791 --> 33:55.500
A hideous mutation.
The slug brings talent to the surface.

33:55.583 --> 33:58.666
I extract it from you
and inject it into me.

33:58.750 --> 33:59.833
Then boom!

33:59.916 --> 34:02.208
Weird Al is the All-Star Cup All-Star

34:02.291 --> 34:05.916
of all All-Stars of all time star
of all all-time star.

34:06.000 --> 34:10.375
You're doing that
by stealing Zlatan's soccer skills!

34:10.958 --> 34:14.791
When you put it that way,
it sounds positively brilliant.

34:14.875 --> 34:16.250
If I do say so.

34:16.333 --> 34:17.541
Yeah?

34:17.625 --> 34:21.416
Sounds to me like
it's not going to work out for you.

34:30.291 --> 34:33.791
How did Weird Al do that? To Zlatan?

34:33.875 --> 34:39.791
I have some of your fellow All-Stars
to thank for these new soccer skills.

34:39.875 --> 34:43.500
You stole All-Star talent already!

34:43.583 --> 34:44.958
You monster!

34:48.583 --> 34:49.458
Huh?

34:49.541 --> 34:51.416
Huh?

34:54.250 --> 34:58.166
And I'll be even stronger
once I steal yours!

34:58.250 --> 35:01.333
Evil maniacal laughter!

35:01.416 --> 35:04.708
I think you're supposed
to actually do the laugh.

35:04.791 --> 35:07.000
I'm not your monkey, Zlatan!

35:10.375 --> 35:13.083
Ow.

35:19.541 --> 35:23.625
Good to go, Ms. Rapinoe. Thank you
for choosing the Creature Catchers.

35:31.125 --> 35:32.625
Hallelujah, happy holidays.

35:32.708 --> 35:37.250
Felt kind of good destroying stuff.
Eating cookies always feels good.

35:37.333 --> 35:41.166
But I do not wanna mutate again.

35:41.250 --> 35:44.625
Slugs shouldn't bother you anymore.
Also…

35:44.708 --> 35:45.583
…can I get a self--

35:45.666 --> 35:47.291
Yes, already, jeez!

35:57.000 --> 35:58.916
Selfie, selfie, selfie!

35:59.000 --> 36:04.458
-You whoopee cushion kids saved my life.
-We're not called that. We're actually--

36:04.541 --> 36:06.833
-Hang on, whoopee cushion kids. Talk.

36:07.541 --> 36:08.625
Oh, no.

36:09.291 --> 36:13.791
Oh, no! There's a group
of paranoid All-Stars down at the stadium.

36:13.875 --> 36:16.750
They won't play till they know
none of them is a mutant.

36:16.833 --> 36:19.958
Don't worry,
count on the whoopee cushion kids.

36:20.041 --> 36:23.416
I mean, Creature Catchers.
You and me will find Zlatan.

36:23.500 --> 36:26.625
You go with Megan,
make sure no All-Stars got slugged.

36:26.708 --> 36:29.416
Once we do that, the game can go on.

36:29.500 --> 36:30.833
I got a selfie. Mm.

36:30.916 --> 36:33.541
Make it fast. All-Star Cup is in an hour.

36:34.125 --> 36:36.291
Selfie, selfie, selfie!

36:38.666 --> 36:42.625
I know I might sound insane,
but I assure you…

36:46.583 --> 36:49.291
Just kidding.

36:49.875 --> 36:55.166
Look, I didn't set out to take
all your talent. Just a drop, really.

36:55.250 --> 37:00.166
I thought if I could have
a drop of talent from each All-Star,

37:00.250 --> 37:05.291
then I'd inject it into myself and
become the greatest All-Star of all time.

37:05.375 --> 37:07.750
The GASOAT, as it were.

37:07.833 --> 37:13.791
You won't stop
until you do this to every All-Star?

37:13.875 --> 37:18.666
Only way to become the GASOAT
is to mutate a few All-Stars.

37:18.750 --> 37:22.500
Now if I could remove the slug
that sucked up your talent,

37:22.583 --> 37:25.916
I'll just take a drop
and then be on my way…

37:26.000 --> 37:27.416
Hey! Where's your slug?

37:28.916 --> 37:32.750
Oh, it looks like it merged
with your ponytail.

37:33.375 --> 37:34.458
Fascinating.

37:34.541 --> 37:36.833
Boo!

37:37.333 --> 37:39.416
-Ya!

37:39.500 --> 37:41.208
Run, Zlatan!

37:41.291 --> 37:42.291
It talks?

37:42.875 --> 37:45.041
Weird Al, meet Ponytail.

37:45.125 --> 37:47.875
Ya-ta-ta-ta! Come on! We gotta go!

37:48.458 --> 37:52.916
Ponytail, prepare to meet
my trusty giant shears!

37:55.958 --> 37:57.791
Goodbye, trusty shears!

37:57.875 --> 37:59.250
Take that, Weird Al.

37:59.333 --> 38:01.750
And take that, trusty shears.

38:02.333 --> 38:05.291
Too bad I don't also have
a trusty bone saw.

38:05.375 --> 38:06.750
Oh, wait!

38:06.833 --> 38:08.541
Toodle-oo, Ponytail.

38:08.625 --> 38:11.375
Zlatan, don't let him cut me!

38:22.833 --> 38:25.583
No!

38:42.500 --> 38:44.541
-Got you!

38:49.416 --> 38:53.375
Zlatan moves like a newborn. Why is this?

38:53.458 --> 38:56.500
All your talent got sucked into here,

38:56.583 --> 39:00.625
just waiting to be injected
into yours truly.

39:00.708 --> 39:04.083
What happened to taking just a drop?
You promised.

39:04.166 --> 39:05.500
I don't recall that.

39:08.000 --> 39:08.875
Ta-da!

39:11.750 --> 39:13.375
Ya!

39:13.458 --> 39:15.916
Ya! Ya! Ya!

39:16.000 --> 39:16.875
Oh!

39:17.791 --> 39:19.750
Okay, Ponytail, give it up!

39:19.833 --> 39:22.541
I stole that talent fair and square.

39:22.625 --> 39:24.666
Stay back, Weird Al.

39:24.750 --> 39:26.208
I'm a wild card.

39:26.291 --> 39:28.583
A wild card, huh?

39:28.666 --> 39:31.791
If I had a nickel for every time I heard
a ponytail say that…

39:31.875 --> 39:35.625
Oh, yeah? Well, now you're dealing
with Zlatan's ponytail.

39:40.625 --> 39:43.416
Wow. I kick exactly like you, Zlatan.

39:43.500 --> 39:47.333
Sweet. Hey, if you can do Kung Fu,
does that mean--

39:47.416 --> 39:49.916
I can already tell you that-- Ow!

39:50.000 --> 39:52.125
You have definitely inherited-- Ow!

39:52.208 --> 39:53.791
Zlatan's Kung…

39:53.875 --> 39:55.208
…Fu skills…

39:55.291 --> 39:56.791
…in addition to his…

39:56.875 --> 39:58.791
…magnetic gaze.

40:01.375 --> 40:04.708
Wow, Zlatan,
I never knew it'd feel this incredible

40:04.791 --> 40:08.458
to be surging
with so much concentrated talent.

40:08.541 --> 40:12.666
And I never knew it would feel so awful
having it taken away.

40:12.750 --> 40:15.791
Huh. Hey, what are you doing?

40:15.875 --> 40:18.958
Reattaching you. I want my talent back.

40:19.041 --> 40:20.708
Let's not be too hasty here.

40:20.791 --> 40:23.958
Oh, hey, look. Smoke bombs!

40:24.708 --> 40:26.625
Quick, Zlatan, kick it away!

40:32.333 --> 40:33.791
How did I miss that?

40:33.875 --> 40:36.125
Because I have all your talent.

40:36.208 --> 40:38.041
Don't be silly. Observe.

40:39.541 --> 40:44.250
Told ya. You got no more talent.

40:44.333 --> 40:48.375
You see?
It's all inside me now!

40:48.458 --> 40:51.125
Not for long, Ponytail. Yoink!

40:51.208 --> 40:54.833
All that talent
is about to go to its new home,

40:54.916 --> 40:56.875
inside Weird Al!

40:57.458 --> 41:01.125
-Zlatan…

41:01.625 --> 41:02.791
Whoo!

41:02.875 --> 41:04.416
I feel so

41:05.000 --> 41:06.666
Zlatan-y!

41:12.208 --> 41:17.291
Feels good to be the All-Star game
All-Star of all All-Stars of all time!

41:17.375 --> 41:19.416
You didn't earn that talent!

41:19.500 --> 41:25.000
I'll earn bragging rights for stealing it.
And a Nobel Prize, if there's any justice.

41:25.083 --> 41:27.250
Anyway, victory awaits.

41:27.333 --> 41:31.125
-Grappling accordion, away!

41:32.291 --> 41:34.958
Zlatan!

41:35.041 --> 41:37.125
Ponytail!

41:45.833 --> 41:49.166
No. No, Ponytail!

41:50.291 --> 41:53.875
Okay, y'all. Listen up.
These weirdos may not look like much,

41:53.958 --> 41:57.958
but the whoopee cushion kids are no joke,
despite their joke-like name.

41:58.041 --> 42:01.208
These two are going to tell you
if you're a slug or not.

42:02.458 --> 42:06.500
Okay, everybody. What we're about to do
is serious business.

42:08.208 --> 42:09.750
Is that a whoopee cushion?

42:09.833 --> 42:12.708
-Indeed it is, soccer player number one.
-What?

42:12.791 --> 42:17.166
Now, before I explain, there's one thing
I must get out of the way.

42:17.250 --> 42:20.083
Can I get a selfie?

42:20.166 --> 42:22.750
Hello? Already gave you one.

42:22.833 --> 42:24.166
Right, sorry.

42:24.250 --> 42:26.708
As soon as I deploy this whoopee cushion,

42:26.791 --> 42:30.416
we'll discover if any of you
is a hideous slug mutant.

42:30.500 --> 42:32.500
Do you expect us to believe

42:32.583 --> 42:37.500
that a fart bag will prove
which of us is a "hideous slug mutant"?

42:37.583 --> 42:42.000
Hey. These two were part of the team
that saved me when I got slugged.

42:42.083 --> 42:44.000
Give the whoopee cushion a chance.

42:44.708 --> 42:47.833
Sounds like something
a slug mutant would say.

42:47.916 --> 42:52.208
Gee, you seem to know a lot
about what slug mutants say, don't you?

42:52.708 --> 42:54.375
-Maybe you're a slug mutant.
-Mm.

42:54.458 --> 42:56.625
-It's getting real!
-I ain't a mutant!

42:56.708 --> 42:59.041
-I always knew you were.
-Stop fighting!

42:59.958 --> 43:02.500
Look at you, turning on one another.

43:02.583 --> 43:07.708
Soccer is a team sport, and whether
you like it or not, you're still a team.

43:07.791 --> 43:13.083
We'll conduct the test one at a time,
in case you all got slugged.

43:15.333 --> 43:17.750
I'm no mutant.
You're wasting everyone's time!

43:17.833 --> 43:20.875
Yeah. That's what all the mutants say.

43:28.666 --> 43:32.625
Don't worry, Nautai. I got your back.
Me and this broom.

43:32.708 --> 43:35.250
Hello, I am not a mutant.

43:35.333 --> 43:37.041
Squeeze the fart bag!

43:41.083 --> 43:43.541
Is he mutating? Are you mutating? Hmm?

43:44.541 --> 43:46.875
Oh, not a mutant! All good.

43:46.958 --> 43:48.125
Phew!

43:48.208 --> 43:51.125
Told ya! I knew the whole time.

43:58.458 --> 43:59.833
All right, I'm up.

43:59.916 --> 44:02.875
Don't worry,
this will be quick and painless.

44:05.791 --> 44:07.458
See, I told you I was…

44:07.541 --> 44:08.958
…right!

44:49.125 --> 44:50.875
Come on, Zlatan.

44:50.958 --> 44:53.916
Kick it. You know you can kick it.

44:56.666 --> 44:58.791
No!

45:11.041 --> 45:14.791
Game starts in ten minutes.
Keep your eyes peeled for Zlatan.

45:14.875 --> 45:17.666
That crying hobo looks like Zlatan.

45:17.750 --> 45:20.083
That crying hobo is Zlatan!

45:24.500 --> 45:25.416
Zlatan?

45:25.500 --> 45:31.666
No, just a pile of talentless skin,
talentless bones, and no ponytail.

45:39.000 --> 45:40.250
How does it look?

45:41.000 --> 45:44.041
Uh… So how'd all this go down?

45:44.125 --> 45:46.416
It's a tale as old as time.

45:46.500 --> 45:49.041
Weird Al stole my talent to become

45:49.125 --> 45:53.541
the All-Star Cup All-Star
of all All-Stars of all-time.

45:54.625 --> 45:57.666
And there's nothing I can do.

45:58.166 --> 46:00.125
You can't just give up!

46:00.208 --> 46:03.791
You're still Zlatan,
with or without your talent.

46:04.875 --> 46:08.416
Good point, but we've got to get
to the stadium before Weird Al.

46:10.833 --> 46:13.083
And I just learned to walk again.

46:13.166 --> 46:16.375
You'll have to learn to do
a lot of stuff again.

46:22.666 --> 46:24.458
Now try to kick the ball.

46:24.541 --> 46:27.125
Zlatan will not try to kick.

46:27.208 --> 46:28.666
Zlatan will kick.

46:34.375 --> 46:35.666
What's your problem?

46:36.875 --> 46:37.750
It's cool.

46:38.333 --> 46:40.041
We'll just take it slow.

46:40.125 --> 46:42.125
Zlatan, we need you to juggle.

46:42.208 --> 46:45.083
I can't, my talent has been stolen.

46:45.166 --> 46:47.375
All I have now is my beauty.

46:47.458 --> 46:50.875
Then you're gonna
have to grow some new talent.

46:59.000 --> 47:00.333
Again, please.

47:08.958 --> 47:10.250
Again.

47:14.541 --> 47:17.291
Hey! Keep it down out there!

47:18.375 --> 47:19.500
Again.

47:23.000 --> 47:24.750
Nice! You're doing it!

47:26.291 --> 47:27.708
Get the ball from us.

47:28.541 --> 47:30.916
But that seems so hard.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.666
-'Tis a sad day.
-Why's that, O'Dang?

47:34.208 --> 47:37.125
Zlatan can't get a ball from two kids.

47:37.625 --> 47:40.875
Hey, watch it!
That's no way to speak to Zlatan.

47:46.041 --> 47:46.916
Again.

47:48.125 --> 47:50.208
Come on, Zlatan, you're the best.

47:58.791 --> 48:00.083
Again. Please.

48:14.708 --> 48:15.541
Again.

48:52.875 --> 48:54.125
That's better.

48:54.208 --> 48:57.500
Now I feel like Zlatan!

48:57.583 --> 49:02.625
I would describe the feeling,
but the world would die of envy.

49:05.041 --> 49:06.875
Someone's back to normal.

49:06.958 --> 49:10.500
Zlatan! Zlatan! Zlatan!

49:13.458 --> 49:18.041
<i>Attention, soccer-football fans,</i>
<i>the game will begin in two minutes.</i>

49:18.125 --> 49:20.791
<i>Also, has anyone seen Zlatan?</i>

49:20.875 --> 49:23.000
<i>Zlatan! Zlatan!</i>

49:25.666 --> 49:27.208
I'm a mutant.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.291
You totally fell for it.

49:32.375 --> 49:36.125
Hey, Zlatan, what if we bring
our buddies up to the field?

49:36.208 --> 49:38.916
Time for the All-Stars to hit the field.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.750
And we are short four players.

49:41.833 --> 49:44.291
So you're gonna have to join us.

49:45.708 --> 49:47.375
You've got the talent.

49:47.916 --> 49:50.125
-You just need better uniforms.

49:50.625 --> 49:55.166
<i>It is time</i>
<i>for an exterior establishing shot.</i>

49:55.250 --> 49:58.041
<i>Now the interior, as the crowd goes wild,</i>

49:58.125 --> 50:02.833
<i>and here come the All-Stars,</i>
<i>inexplicably joined by four local youths.</i>

50:02.916 --> 50:04.916
<i>I, for one, am here for it.</i>

50:08.750 --> 50:12.125
-Shouldn't we look for Weird Al?
-And Ponytail?

50:12.208 --> 50:14.041
You want to delay the game?

50:14.125 --> 50:17.083
Point taken. Let's play some soccer!

50:18.375 --> 50:20.000
Oh yes, let's.

50:25.541 --> 50:28.708
<i>Mutant Weird Al,</i>
<i>showing off his talent, or rather,</i>

50:28.791 --> 50:30.666
<i>every All-Star's talent.</i>

50:32.625 --> 50:35.458
Wow, impressive. You got skills, Weird Al.

50:35.541 --> 50:37.708
Don't applaud, he's the villain!

50:37.791 --> 50:40.583
Okay, everyone, listen up.

50:48.958 --> 50:51.125
Okay, everyone listening?

50:51.208 --> 50:53.541
-Speak up!
-Can't hear you!

50:54.125 --> 50:55.208
What?

50:59.791 --> 51:00.833
I'm Rob Stone.

51:01.416 --> 51:04.041
As you know, I've got more talent

51:04.125 --> 51:06.541
than any of you could ever dream
of having.

51:06.625 --> 51:10.083
And I got to admit, it feels good.

51:10.166 --> 51:12.083
-Poor form!
-What she said!

51:12.166 --> 51:13.875
Boo! You stink!

51:13.958 --> 51:17.041
-Now, now, no need to get upset.

51:17.125 --> 51:21.541
I'm going to give you a chance
to win all your talent back.

51:21.625 --> 51:23.083
A game.

51:23.166 --> 51:25.375
On one team, all of you.

51:25.458 --> 51:28.541
On the other team,
me and a couple of slugs.

51:28.625 --> 51:31.583
-You lose, I get all your talent.

51:32.083 --> 51:33.625
And if we win?

51:34.208 --> 51:38.000
Ha! Oh, you definitely will not win.

51:38.083 --> 51:42.208
If we do, you give back
every drop of talent you stole.

51:42.291 --> 51:45.291
Deal! Or, I take all your talent anyway.

51:45.375 --> 51:47.083
-What was that?
-Nothing!

51:47.666 --> 51:49.000
Game time!

51:49.083 --> 51:51.583
Team mutant, assemble!

52:04.166 --> 52:06.541
Gotta get Ponytail off Weird Al.

52:06.625 --> 52:08.375
What about the game?

52:08.458 --> 52:11.458
Yeah, we gotta do that too,
at the same time.

52:12.208 --> 52:15.666
Oh, right.
Good thing it's not something difficult.

52:15.750 --> 52:18.291
Let the game begin!

52:25.791 --> 52:27.000
<i>So here we are.</i>

52:27.083 --> 52:30.833
<i>If this was a movie,</i>
<i>this would be the climax at the end.</i>

52:30.916 --> 52:34.333
<i>The crowd is electrified</i>
<i>in anticipation of a battle</i>

52:34.416 --> 52:36.708
<i>that can only be described as,</i>

52:36.791 --> 52:37.958
<i>"What?"</i>

52:39.666 --> 52:41.958
<i>On one side, Zlatan, Megan,</i>

52:42.041 --> 52:44.416
<i>and those scrappy youths</i>
<i>with hearts of gold.</i>

52:44.500 --> 52:48.583
<i>On the other, Weird Al</i>
<i>and his army of gelatinous mutants.</i>

52:48.666 --> 52:52.291
<i>Who is going home with the All-Star Cup?</i>
<i>I'm Rob Stone.</i>

53:19.041 --> 53:21.125
<i>These mutant slugs are on the move,</i>

53:21.208 --> 53:22.458
<i>much like </i>Mannequin 2.

53:22.541 --> 53:26.083
-<i>Whoa! Zlatan limbos in for a steal!</i>
-Yeah!

53:26.166 --> 53:28.458
<i>Can the slugs limbo lower now?</i>

53:28.541 --> 53:33.000
<i>Here comes Mutant Weird Al</i>
<i>to show them how it's done mutant-style.</i>

53:33.875 --> 53:35.125
<i>He's going for the goal.</i>

53:36.666 --> 53:37.708
<i>Score!</i>

53:37.791 --> 53:42.291
<i>First goal of the game goes to Weird Al.</i>
<i>Look at that victory dance.</i>

53:42.375 --> 53:46.666
<i>Say what you will about his evil agenda,</i>
<i>the guy can butt bump.</i>

53:52.250 --> 53:54.500
-<i>Score! Another goal!</i>

53:54.583 --> 53:59.458
<i>The lord of the accordion and his</i>
<i>gooey minions are just racking them up.</i>

53:59.541 --> 54:02.166
<i>There's a lot of happy slugs out there.</i>

54:12.583 --> 54:13.916
<i>Goal! Finally.</i>

54:14.000 --> 54:17.416
<i>Zlatan scores and</i>
<i>gets the All-Stars on the board.</i>

54:18.375 --> 54:19.250
Ya!

54:20.625 --> 54:21.458
To me!

54:32.750 --> 54:35.041
<i>Weird Al is racking up the points.</i>

54:35.125 --> 54:40.000
<i>Could this be the end of the line for our</i>
<i>scrappy youths and their hearts of gold?</i>

54:41.000 --> 54:45.958
<i>The chips are down. I dropped my bag</i>
<i>of chips, and the All-Stars are losing.</i>

54:46.041 --> 54:47.250
<i>I'm Rob Stone.</i>

54:47.333 --> 54:48.583
<i>-Goal!</i>

54:50.125 --> 54:53.291
<i>Rapinoe is adept</i>
<i>at dodging these monstrosities…</i>

54:53.375 --> 54:55.833
<i>Oh! And the monstrosity steals!</i>

54:55.916 --> 54:59.000
-<i>Rapinoe is not going to stand for that.</i>
-Ew.

54:59.083 --> 55:02.833
<i>Oh, wow,</i>
<i>that's… some grade-A funk right there.</i>

55:08.166 --> 55:11.583
<i>Nautai dancing circles</i>
<i>around these creepy slug things.</i>

55:11.666 --> 55:13.583
<i>-She kicks, she scores!</i>

55:13.666 --> 55:15.416
-Yes! Yes!

55:15.500 --> 55:16.833
<i>We're at 7 to 3.</i>

55:16.916 --> 55:19.541
<i>All-Stars creeping up on the creeps.</i>

55:19.625 --> 55:23.541
<i>Rapinoe to Palio.</i>
<i>Some deft footwork here by All-Star Palio.</i>

55:23.625 --> 55:25.833
<i>He shoots, Palio scores!</i>

55:25.916 --> 55:27.083
<i>-7 to 4.</i>

55:29.750 --> 55:32.041
<i>Power block by Zana. Epic save.</i>

55:32.125 --> 55:33.250
<i>Zlatan passes.</i>

55:33.333 --> 55:35.833
<i>O'Dang is off and running, and goal!</i>

55:35.916 --> 55:39.166
<i>-O'Dang kicks it up! We're at 7 to 5.</i>

55:40.083 --> 55:43.458
<i>Fun fact, last week,</i>
<i>these Creature Catchers wrangled</i>

55:43.541 --> 55:46.666
<i>a baker's dozen of possums</i>
<i>from my crawl space.</i>

55:47.333 --> 55:49.416
<i>-Seven to six!</i>

56:02.666 --> 56:03.791
<i>Seven to seven!</i>

56:03.875 --> 56:05.000
Yeah, yeah.

56:05.083 --> 56:06.541
<i>Rapinoe ties it up.</i>

56:07.666 --> 56:10.875
<i>Now, let's see</i>
<i>if the All-Stars can deliver it.</i>

56:10.958 --> 56:14.458
<i>Zlatan's got that look in his eyes,</i>
<i>he's got something to prove.</i>

56:15.125 --> 56:17.000
GASOAT!

56:18.500 --> 56:19.375
GASOAT.

56:20.000 --> 56:21.333
GASOAT?

56:21.916 --> 56:25.666
<i>It all starts with a ball,</i>
<i>and a person, and their foot.</i>

56:25.750 --> 56:29.166
<i>Zlatan gets ready,</i>
<i>gets set, and he shoots…</i>

56:51.000 --> 56:52.500
-Keep it--

56:52.583 --> 56:53.541
Thank you.

56:54.541 --> 56:59.541
<i>And Zlatan scores</i>
<i>just in the nick of time!</i>

57:00.750 --> 57:03.375
-<i>The All-Stars win it!</i>

57:03.458 --> 57:04.708
<i>We're done here!</i>

57:19.750 --> 57:21.291
-Yes!
-Yay! We won!

57:21.375 --> 57:23.333
-Yes! Yes! Yes!
-Yeah!

57:23.416 --> 57:25.791
No, no, no, no, no!

57:25.875 --> 57:30.291
I wanted to be the All-Star Cup All-Star
of all All-Stars of all-time.

57:30.375 --> 57:34.458
Now I'm just a doctor-mayor-doctor-mutant.

57:34.541 --> 57:38.083
-Oh, that's it!

57:38.166 --> 57:40.625
Hey, watch it, Ponytail, that hurts!

57:40.708 --> 57:43.041
Doesn't hurt as much as losing!

57:43.125 --> 57:47.875
You don't deserve all this talent.
The real thing is always better.

57:47.958 --> 57:49.958
Well, that was fun.

57:50.041 --> 57:52.500
Glad I tried it, but it sure is…

57:55.208 --> 57:57.541
great being back to normal. I--

57:59.416 --> 58:01.875
Hey! Stop deflating me!

58:03.458 --> 58:06.458
Ew, hair in my mouth.

58:06.541 --> 58:09.541
Take that, Weird Al! Still a fan though.

58:10.500 --> 58:15.208
You know, I thought I'd never want to
leave the back of Zlatan's head.

58:15.291 --> 58:18.875
Until I got all this talent.

58:23.916 --> 58:24.750
Uh…

58:41.541 --> 58:44.208
I was in the bathroom.
What did--

58:44.291 --> 58:48.666
What? Was it something I said?

58:48.750 --> 58:51.750
So I look like this now.

58:57.916 --> 59:00.708
-My appetizers!

59:00.791 --> 59:04.125
-Get back here! You too, you two.

59:04.208 --> 59:06.583
Where do you think you're going?

59:10.875 --> 59:13.833
Runaway slugs! Don't mind if I do!

59:17.375 --> 59:18.708
Good slugs!

59:18.791 --> 59:21.583
Now for an All-Star main course!

59:23.500 --> 59:24.458
Whoop!

59:28.458 --> 59:30.291
Stop right there!

59:31.875 --> 59:34.541
It appears as though I've had a change of…

59:34.625 --> 59:35.625
-…fart.

59:35.708 --> 59:37.166
Phew!

59:37.250 --> 59:40.625
Yes, I stole people's talent
using advanced genetics,

59:40.708 --> 59:44.625
but I've seen the error
of my brilliantly evil ways.

59:44.708 --> 59:45.583
And now

59:46.458 --> 59:49.583
it's time for a little redemption,
Weird Al-style.

59:49.666 --> 59:51.541
Hello, Ponytail.

59:51.625 --> 59:54.250
-It's me, Doctor-Mayor-Doctor Weird Al.

59:54.333 --> 59:56.833
Or as you might know me, Mama.

59:56.916 --> 1:00:00.208
-I believe we can both be reasonable here.
-Mama.

1:00:02.583 --> 1:00:06.625
So that's what I raised?
A ponytail who eats his own mother?

1:00:06.708 --> 1:00:09.333
Fine. I hope I taste terrible.

1:00:09.416 --> 1:00:11.875
Nope. Just weird.

1:00:11.958 --> 1:00:13.041
See what I did there?

1:00:13.958 --> 1:00:17.541
Talking with your mouth full?
Who raised you?

1:00:17.625 --> 1:00:19.750
Oh, guess it was me.

1:00:20.875 --> 1:00:24.291
More nuanced and complex
than I initially realized.

1:00:24.375 --> 1:00:27.708
Anyway, who wants to get eaten next?

1:00:28.291 --> 1:00:30.000
You want to eat them?

1:00:30.083 --> 1:00:34.166
You start right here with Zlatan.

1:00:34.250 --> 1:00:35.375
Zlatan!

1:00:35.458 --> 1:00:37.500
I'll give you one last chance.

1:00:37.583 --> 1:00:38.875
Take me back.

1:00:38.958 --> 1:00:40.958
Well, I'm kind of seeing someone.

1:00:41.041 --> 1:00:44.375
No, I meant reattach me to your head.

1:00:44.458 --> 1:00:48.333
I came to life
from just one drop of your talent.

1:00:48.416 --> 1:00:52.958
Imagine what we could do with
every drop of every All-Star's talent.

1:00:53.041 --> 1:00:56.583
And now also Weird Al's talent.

1:01:03.291 --> 1:01:07.708
Come on, Zlatan. Together,
we can be the greatest of all time.

1:01:07.791 --> 1:01:10.500
G-O-A-T. GOAT!

1:01:11.416 --> 1:01:13.791
No goats, just Zlatan.

1:01:13.875 --> 1:01:15.416
Be both!

1:01:15.500 --> 1:01:16.750
Just reattach me.

1:01:16.833 --> 1:01:20.000
Talent is in here
waiting for you to soak it up.

1:01:20.083 --> 1:01:21.125
Come on.

1:01:21.208 --> 1:01:26.000
Just think,
we'll be the ultimate All-Star.

1:01:26.500 --> 1:01:30.083
Zlatan already is the ultimate All-Star!

1:01:30.166 --> 1:01:32.250
Oh, maybe out here.

1:01:32.333 --> 1:01:34.708
But let's see how ultimate you are

1:01:34.791 --> 1:01:37.625
inside my guts!

1:01:47.291 --> 1:01:49.333
Puke him up, Ponytail!

1:01:49.416 --> 1:01:51.583
Oh, I don't think so!

1:01:51.666 --> 1:01:54.958
In fact, I still have room for more!

1:01:55.041 --> 1:01:59.125
I'm so hungry I could eat
David Beckham's talent.

1:02:00.166 --> 1:02:02.791
Hey! Hey, what are you weirdos doing?

1:02:09.083 --> 1:02:10.666
Curse you, Rapinoe!

1:02:10.750 --> 1:02:11.791
Let's go!

1:02:34.833 --> 1:02:35.833
Ow!

1:02:41.583 --> 1:02:43.500
Zlatan!

1:03:07.166 --> 1:03:08.791
Yes!

1:03:08.875 --> 1:03:11.791
-Zlatan! Zlatan! Zlatan!
-Yes, yes, yes!

1:03:11.875 --> 1:03:13.791
-Zlatan, yes!
-Woo-hoo!

1:03:13.875 --> 1:03:16.666
Wait! What about Weird Al?

1:03:17.250 --> 1:03:18.750
Guess he didn't make it.

1:03:24.500 --> 1:03:28.458
Take that, green glowing slug of death.
I escaped!

1:03:29.916 --> 1:03:32.583
Through a hole Zlatan kicked in his belly?

1:03:32.666 --> 1:03:34.916
Hole? In its belly?

1:03:35.625 --> 1:03:36.791
Wonderful!

1:03:36.875 --> 1:03:39.583
No.
I didn't know about the belly hole.

1:03:39.666 --> 1:03:43.208
This, uh, is the first time
I'm hearing about that. Hmm.

1:03:43.291 --> 1:03:45.666
-Does anyone have a mint?

1:03:46.250 --> 1:03:48.833
Here you go,
Doctor-Mayor-Doctor-Mister Al.

1:03:48.916 --> 1:03:51.166
Please, we're friends now.

1:03:51.250 --> 1:03:53.750
Just call me Doctor-Mayor-Doctor Weird.

1:03:54.708 --> 1:03:56.208
Okay, see… Hmm.

1:03:56.291 --> 1:03:58.333
Oh. Yeah.

1:03:58.416 --> 1:04:00.791
-Ah.
-You know what? Here. They're yours.

1:04:00.875 --> 1:04:02.291
Oh no, I couldn't.

1:04:02.375 --> 1:04:05.291
Please, save me the trouble
of throwing them in the trash.

1:04:06.250 --> 1:04:08.958
Wow, that was impressive.

1:04:09.041 --> 1:04:11.291
You played one monster of a game.

1:04:11.375 --> 1:04:13.458
The All-Stars win it.

1:04:13.541 --> 1:04:16.541
I'm Rob Stone, and that is game.

1:04:16.625 --> 1:04:19.666
For all creature-catching needs,
be sure to call…

1:04:19.750 --> 1:04:21.375
Creature Catchers!

1:04:21.458 --> 1:04:24.250
Creature Catchers rule! Woo-hoo!

1:04:32.166 --> 1:04:33.291
Pass it to me!

1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:36.000
Over here!

1:04:40.583 --> 1:04:41.500
Yes!

1:04:42.291 --> 1:04:44.500
-Selfie, selfie, selfie!

1:04:45.958 --> 1:04:47.000
I got this.

1:04:47.083 --> 1:04:49.791
All right!

1:04:57.958 --> 1:04:58.916
Whoa.

1:05:14.291 --> 1:05:16.000
Keep it down--

1:05:19.916 --> 1:05:20.958
Sequel time.

1:05:30.583 --> 1:05:34.000
Hello, I am Zlatan, as if you didn't know.

1:05:35.041 --> 1:05:38.541
Uh, Netflix asked me
to reassure younger viewers

1:05:38.625 --> 1:05:41.166
who are concerned for Zlatan's safety.

1:05:41.250 --> 1:05:43.125
This is just a silly story.

1:05:43.208 --> 1:05:44.916
Zlatan is perfectly safe.

1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:48.375
-See, no slug on my ponytail.

1:05:48.458 --> 1:05:50.958
Slug on my ponytail! Get it off!

1:05:53.375 --> 1:05:55.375
It's real! So real!
