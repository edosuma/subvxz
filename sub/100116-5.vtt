WEBVTT

00:00.417 --> 00:03.337
Previously on Legacies...
The monsters are back.

00:03.337 --> 00:07.090
I have no idea how or why
or if it's gonna stop.

00:07.090 --> 00:09.134
MG:
This was the only way
I could think of

00:09.134 --> 00:10.135
to get you to see

00:10.135 --> 00:11.762
Sebastian's not real!

00:11.762 --> 00:12.763
Shut up!

00:12.763 --> 00:14.806
You don't exist to me.

00:14.806 --> 00:16.683
What did you say
to Elizabeth?

00:16.683 --> 00:18.894
Sebastian?

00:18.894 --> 00:21.438
Go long!
LANDON: Look, I know
you say you're fine,

00:21.438 --> 00:22.856
but you were stuck as a wolf
for a pretty long time.

00:22.856 --> 00:25.525
Yeah, and I'm back now.
LANDON: Thanks to Hope.

00:25.525 --> 00:27.653
And the entire world
has forgotten that I exist.

00:27.653 --> 00:29.780
And the boy I love
has moved on.

00:29.780 --> 00:31.740
Not yet, but soon.

00:31.740 --> 00:33.534
JOSIE:
I kind of blasted Lizzie
with enough

00:33.534 --> 00:35.786
black magic to exorcise
an army out of her head.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.462
Hope... Andrea...

00:45.462 --> 00:46.922
Mikaelson.

00:46.922 --> 00:49.633
What?
It's official.

00:49.633 --> 00:51.176
I remember everything.

00:51.176 --> 00:53.512
When I woke up from that
spell Josie blasted me with,

00:53.512 --> 00:57.432
you popped into my messed-up
brain like an acid flashback.

00:57.432 --> 01:00.394
How? (laughs) You are
literally the only person

01:00.394 --> 01:02.771
on the planet
who knows that I exist.
Epic former

01:02.771 --> 01:04.648
frenemy reunion is
gonna have to wait.

01:04.648 --> 01:06.149
We have bigger drama.

01:07.317 --> 01:11.071
Josie and Landon are
having sex tonight.

01:11.071 --> 01:13.073
What?

01:13.073 --> 01:14.324
There's a decade dance.

01:14.324 --> 01:15.951
Okay, well, that doesn't mean...

01:15.951 --> 01:17.953
She asked me to
find an excuse

01:17.953 --> 01:19.871
to stay with my dad.

01:19.871 --> 01:22.582
You have to stop it.

01:22.582 --> 01:23.750
Speak your truth.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.127
Spill your beans,
tell your tale.

01:25.127 --> 01:26.628
Why didn't you tell her?

01:26.628 --> 01:28.714
Because I didn't want to be
the one to break her heart.

01:28.714 --> 01:31.591
That's your job.
(gurgling)

01:31.591 --> 01:34.386
Ugh. Not a good time.

01:36.722 --> 01:39.182
(coughing)

01:39.182 --> 01:41.393
(sighs)

01:41.393 --> 01:42.894
(coughs)
Mm.

01:42.894 --> 01:44.479
Who the hell are you?

01:44.479 --> 01:45.814
(laughs)

01:45.814 --> 01:47.691
I'm the Keeper.

01:47.691 --> 01:53.530
Ah. And this is gonna be a lot
easier than I thought. (laughs)

01:53.530 --> 01:54.656
(sighs)

01:54.656 --> 01:56.533
Welcome to the game.

01:59.286 --> 02:01.955
(video game musical flourish)

02:03.457 --> 02:06.209
Well, that was...
anticlimactic.

02:06.209 --> 02:08.462
We have to get to the school
to protect Landon.

02:08.462 --> 02:10.464
More like protect Josie
from Landon by warning her

02:10.464 --> 02:12.758
she's about to have sex
with a human-sized muppet.

02:12.758 --> 02:14.426
(engine revving,
tires squealing)

02:16.553 --> 02:19.514
(video game musical flourish)

02:19.514 --> 02:20.724
What just happened?

02:20.724 --> 02:22.976
I think the game
just started.

02:29.900 --> 02:32.110
(video game musical flourish)

02:32.110 --> 02:34.780
(breathing loudly, snoring)

02:37.616 --> 02:38.784
Hey.

02:38.784 --> 02:39.951
Hey.
Oh! What?

02:39.951 --> 02:42.371
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What?

02:42.371 --> 02:43.705
Can you see him?

02:43.705 --> 02:45.123
All I see is a dude

02:45.123 --> 02:46.958
who can't respect boundaries.

02:46.958 --> 02:48.668
I told you.
No one else can see me.

02:48.668 --> 02:49.753
Oh. (groans)

02:49.753 --> 02:51.505
Boy!
MG.

02:51.505 --> 02:52.798
You're trippin'.

02:52.798 --> 02:55.342
Well... I know. I know, I know.

02:55.342 --> 02:57.594
But Lizzie--
she-she met this new vampire.

02:57.594 --> 03:00.806
Oh, yeah. Uh, Sebastian.
Yeah.

03:00.806 --> 03:04.643
She's been flapping her gums
about him all over school.

03:04.643 --> 03:06.770
He isn't real.

03:06.770 --> 03:08.146
So I thought Lizzie was

03:08.146 --> 03:10.732
losing it, but now
I am seeing him.

03:10.732 --> 03:13.568
So, either I'm hallucinating,
or this dude...

03:13.568 --> 03:14.653
Whoa. What the...?

03:14.653 --> 03:16.029
Would you stop touching me?!

03:16.029 --> 03:17.739
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey.

03:17.739 --> 03:19.282
Hey. Hey, buddy.

03:19.282 --> 03:21.910
Um...

03:21.910 --> 03:23.662
ask him what he wants.

03:23.662 --> 03:25.497
He wants us to find his body.

03:25.497 --> 03:28.375
He says he's been desiccated
in a box somewhere.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.752
He's a little vague
on specifics.

03:30.752 --> 03:32.754
I am vague,

03:32.754 --> 03:35.924
because,
as aforementioned...

03:35.924 --> 03:37.926
(clears throat)
I am, uh, desiccated

03:37.926 --> 03:39.845
in a box!
(grunts)

03:39.845 --> 03:42.139
Oh, my God.
I'm a pacifist.

03:42.139 --> 03:44.641
But if you touch my hair
again, we will throw hands.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.601
(chuckling): Oh.
Yeah. Yeah. Whoa.

03:46.601 --> 03:48.603
(grunting)

03:48.603 --> 03:50.522
Stop!

03:53.942 --> 03:55.735
Sorry.

03:55.735 --> 03:57.654
(groans)

03:57.654 --> 04:00.782
Please tell
your far more intelligent friend

04:00.782 --> 04:02.701
that I have recently come
into contact with blood.

04:02.701 --> 04:07.664
Just a... just enough to reach
that very limited mind of yours.

04:08.790 --> 04:11.042
The blood was rancid.

04:12.335 --> 04:15.547
You remember that nasty
blood fountain we moved?

04:17.048 --> 04:18.884
(gasps)
(laughs)

04:18.884 --> 04:20.677
All right,
everybody work together.

04:20.677 --> 04:22.637
And Lizzie's gonna be here
any second.

04:22.637 --> 04:25.891
And trust me, you do not want
to have only 98 red balloons.

04:30.812 --> 04:32.773
(laughs)

04:32.773 --> 04:34.441
What's so funny?

04:34.441 --> 04:36.693
You said you and Josie were
getting pretty intense, right?

04:36.693 --> 04:37.694
Yeah.

04:37.694 --> 04:38.862
And it's a dance.

04:38.862 --> 04:40.530
It's a dance. So?

04:40.530 --> 04:42.115
She thinks it's gonna
happen tonight.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.533
No, there's no way.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.827
Dude, sex after a dance is so...
So, what?

04:45.827 --> 04:47.370
Eighties?

04:49.080 --> 04:50.040
JOSIE:
Hey.

04:50.040 --> 04:53.543
So, I talked to Lizzie,

04:53.543 --> 04:55.795
and she's actually gonna stay
in town with my dad tonight.

04:55.795 --> 04:57.797
Good.
Yeah.

04:57.797 --> 04:59.382
Just an FYI, right?

04:59.382 --> 05:00.926
LANDON:
Yeah.

05:00.926 --> 05:02.594
(chuckling softly)

05:05.639 --> 05:07.599
(balloon pops)

05:09.809 --> 05:11.811
(laughter)

05:13.605 --> 05:15.482
Dude.

05:16.691 --> 05:18.443
I'm cool.

05:18.443 --> 05:20.153
Just... just
a little jumpy.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.863
You've been a little jumpy
a lot lately.

05:21.863 --> 05:23.740
If all this stuff is too
much, you don't have to...

05:23.740 --> 05:27.118
Exposure therapy. It's, uh...
it's supposed to be good for me.

05:27.118 --> 05:30.622
Plus, I want to be able
to handle the dance tonight.

05:30.622 --> 05:31.957
Yeah, in case Hope
happens to accept

05:31.957 --> 05:33.416
the invitation
you sent her?

05:33.416 --> 05:36.002
Dude, how about you worry
about yourself tonight?

05:37.462 --> 05:39.005
I am.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.973
HOPE: Okay, let's
try this again.

05:51.685 --> 05:54.854
So, since we're trapped here,
are we ever gonna talk about how

05:54.854 --> 05:57.482
you came back from Malivore and
decided not to tell any of us?

05:57.482 --> 06:00.694
Sorry. I'm a little busy
keeping us from being roadkill.

06:02.070 --> 06:04.864
Projectium Deflecta.

06:04.864 --> 06:06.575
That should protect us.

06:06.575 --> 06:09.077
(engine revving)

06:10.203 --> 06:11.746
(video game musical flourish)
(gasps)

06:11.746 --> 06:13.498
I don't think
we have magic here.

06:13.498 --> 06:15.917
Or you just did
the spell wrong.

06:15.917 --> 06:17.752
How's that siphoning going?

06:17.752 --> 06:19.671
Okay, fine. There's
obviously no magic.

06:19.671 --> 06:22.632
And we're in some sort
of death maze from hell.

06:23.925 --> 06:25.594
And...

06:25.594 --> 06:28.013
(phone ringing)

06:28.013 --> 06:29.055
(laughs)

06:29.055 --> 06:31.057
Why is it the '80s?

06:31.057 --> 06:32.475
Speaking of...

06:32.475 --> 06:34.644
Have you ever played Frogger?

06:36.896 --> 06:39.316
(video game musical flourish)

06:43.236 --> 06:45.155
(engine revving)

06:46.031 --> 06:48.033
(both gasp)

06:57.167 --> 06:59.419
Acid wash is
clearly your thing.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.713
Right? You kind of
look fierce, too.

07:01.713 --> 07:02.797
Thank you.

07:02.797 --> 07:04.549
But now we got
to get out of here.

07:05.300 --> 07:07.552
Oh. My hair is still wet.

07:07.552 --> 07:09.387
(electricity crackles)
(shrieks)

07:09.387 --> 07:10.764
(video game musical flourish)

07:10.764 --> 07:13.224
Should have seen
that one coming.

07:15.143 --> 07:18.396
Josie, may I make a suggestion
about the dance floor?

07:18.396 --> 07:20.231
ALARIC:
Aren't you supposed
to be having

07:20.231 --> 07:22.150
brunch with your father?
Dad.

07:22.150 --> 07:24.319
Hey, I'm sorry. Uh...
Principal Saltzman.

07:24.319 --> 07:25.820
I'm afraid
I must remind you

07:25.820 --> 07:27.781
that you are prohibited
from being here.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.783
By court order.

07:29.783 --> 07:30.909
Relax, Fumbledore.

07:30.909 --> 07:32.494
I cleared it
with the sheriff.

07:32.494 --> 07:34.496
I'm here as a
concerned parent, as

07:34.496 --> 07:37.415
both my daughters recently
experienced a traumatic event.

07:37.415 --> 07:39.584
The samurai and the Oni Demon?

07:39.584 --> 07:43.254
Josie told me all about it.

07:43.254 --> 07:45.882
JOSIE:
I'm okay. Thank you
for checking in, but

07:45.882 --> 07:47.384
everything's fine.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.387
Mm-hmm. All right.

07:50.387 --> 07:52.013
But what about Lizzie?

07:52.013 --> 07:54.099
She was a
no-show, too.

07:54.099 --> 07:55.100
So, where is she?

07:55.100 --> 07:57.352
She said she had
an errand to run.

07:57.352 --> 07:59.479
Hmm. All right.

07:59.479 --> 08:02.691
Well, I'm not going
anywhere until she gets back

08:02.691 --> 08:05.527
and I know that
she's okay, too.

08:10.073 --> 08:11.574
We've never made
it this far.

08:13.034 --> 08:15.537
(click, high-pitched tone)

08:15.537 --> 08:17.580
(whoosh,
video game musical flourish)

08:17.580 --> 08:19.708
(sighs)
A land mine? Really?

08:19.708 --> 08:21.668
What's wrong
with this decade?

08:21.668 --> 08:24.337
Reaganomics?
Recreational cocaine?

08:24.337 --> 08:27.132
Jams?
If only there was a secret

08:27.132 --> 08:28.383
or-or a clue.

08:28.383 --> 08:31.970
Unless you see a clue
store around here, Hope,

08:31.970 --> 08:33.847
then I don't think...

08:36.015 --> 08:38.309
Okay.

08:46.151 --> 08:47.277
Oh, hey.

08:47.277 --> 08:48.945
(video game musical flourish)

08:48.945 --> 08:49.988
Looking for something?

08:49.988 --> 08:51.990
Yeah. How do we
get out of here?

08:51.990 --> 08:54.534
And why are we in
our grandparents' decade?

08:54.534 --> 08:57.036
Oh, yeah. Sorry.
It's the only decade I know.

08:57.036 --> 08:59.497
Turns out
you miss a lot of pop culture

08:59.497 --> 09:01.499
when guys
in black suits drop you

09:01.499 --> 09:04.711
into a giant pit of goo.

09:04.711 --> 09:07.922
As for getting out of
here goes, uh, you don't.

09:07.922 --> 09:11.760
You play the game until my pet
feeds on you, and then you die.

09:13.011 --> 09:14.095
For reals.

09:14.095 --> 09:16.139
This game was
specifically designed

09:16.139 --> 09:18.141
to kill beautiful maidens, so,

09:18.141 --> 09:20.101
I'd say it's a
pretty good fit.

09:20.101 --> 09:21.728
Oh. So glad we stopped in.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.188
Let's go.

09:23.188 --> 09:25.190
There is, um...

09:25.190 --> 09:28.359
one... way out.

09:29.444 --> 09:31.821
One of you agrees
to take my place.

09:33.031 --> 09:35.116
Look, I was trapped
here once, too, okay?

09:35.116 --> 09:36.868
Just like you two, and I...

09:36.868 --> 09:38.244
I don't really feel like being

09:38.244 --> 09:40.079
the Keeper of the
Game, like, forever.

09:40.079 --> 09:41.581
So, one of you agrees

09:41.581 --> 09:44.167
to wear this bracelet,
you get to be

09:44.167 --> 09:45.710
the new me.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.545
And the other one
is set free.

09:47.545 --> 09:50.298
Thanks, but, uh, no thanks.

09:50.298 --> 09:53.426
Actually, I'm afraid
there's no other option.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.762
(clicks tongue)
Yeah.

09:55.762 --> 09:59.224
You take the deal,
or my pet kills you.

09:59.224 --> 10:01.017
That's the endgame.

10:01.017 --> 10:03.520
(animal bellowing)

10:03.520 --> 10:05.563
(gasps)
Speak of the devil.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.485
(hoofbeats approaching)

10:10.485 --> 10:13.238
Ah. I love this part.

10:13.238 --> 10:15.323
(bellowing)

10:16.157 --> 10:18.451
(growling)

10:22.205 --> 10:23.373
Oh, my God!

10:23.373 --> 10:25.041
Hurry, come on!

10:25.792 --> 10:27.794
(roaring)

10:33.633 --> 10:35.802
(Minotaur roaring)

10:45.103 --> 10:46.813
Okay, I think we lost him.

10:46.813 --> 10:48.189
LIZZIE:
At least we finally
made it out

10:48.189 --> 10:49.899
of the lame town square,
no thanks to you,

10:49.899 --> 10:52.777
Captain Almost-Stepped-on-the-
Land-Mine-Again.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.153
You killed us with a hair dryer.

10:54.153 --> 10:55.321
Never forget.

10:55.321 --> 10:57.574
The school's up
this way.

10:57.574 --> 10:59.158
If only there were something
to talk about on the way.

10:59.158 --> 11:01.035
Some burning question.

11:01.035 --> 11:04.122
Some mysterious choice
that demanded an explanation.

11:04.122 --> 11:05.540
Okay, fine.

11:05.540 --> 11:08.167
I was gonna tell everyone
that I was back.

11:08.167 --> 11:10.545
But then I saw Landon
and Josie.

11:10.545 --> 11:12.171
And how happy they were.
(scoffs)

11:12.171 --> 11:14.090
It just seemed like you all
were better off without me.

11:14.090 --> 11:16.217
(scoffs)
What is wrong with you?

11:16.217 --> 11:18.845
Do you really have that much
of a martyr complex

11:18.845 --> 11:20.388
that you couldn't just--
oh, I don't know--

11:20.388 --> 11:22.932
ask one of us
how we were doing?

11:22.932 --> 11:24.475
Look, I know that it seems
kind of...

11:24.475 --> 11:25.935
Dumb? Selfish?

11:25.935 --> 11:27.103
Controlling?

11:27.103 --> 11:29.314
Painful.

11:30.940 --> 11:33.443
No one's been better off
without you.

11:33.443 --> 11:36.237
Landon and Josie
are just filling a void

11:36.237 --> 11:38.072
left by you and Penelope.

11:38.072 --> 11:39.449
My dad is lonely.

11:39.449 --> 11:41.618
Raf's a mess again,
and apparently

11:41.618 --> 11:43.661
I'm hallucinating boyfriends.

11:43.661 --> 11:46.247
If my broken mind
can remember you,

11:46.247 --> 11:47.999
then maybe that spell Josie did

11:47.999 --> 11:49.834
could bring everyone's
memories back.

11:49.834 --> 11:52.670
You and Landon
are made for each other,

11:52.670 --> 11:54.339
which is why
you need to tell him

11:54.339 --> 11:56.507
and Josie before
they do the deed.

12:02.597 --> 12:03.973
You hallucinated a boyfriend?

12:07.268 --> 12:08.728
Tell you in a second.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.396
(video game musical flourish)

12:12.440 --> 12:14.901
Yeah, he's real,
all right...

12:14.901 --> 12:16.945
but damn.

12:16.945 --> 12:19.948
Dude smells worse than
that blood fountain.
Mm-hmm.

12:19.948 --> 12:21.616
SEBASTIAN:
Oh, you're both weaklings.

12:21.616 --> 12:23.117
Shut up. Your face
look like beef jerky.

12:23.117 --> 12:24.118
KALEB:
Oh, is he here?

12:24.118 --> 12:25.370
Tell him to talk to me.

12:25.370 --> 12:28.039
Oh, as much
as I would love that,

12:28.039 --> 12:30.249
in my diminished state,
I can only appear

12:30.249 --> 12:33.544
to the fragile-minded...
like you.

12:33.544 --> 12:36.214
Um, he... says

12:36.214 --> 12:37.548
that you have
to be on, like,

12:37.548 --> 12:40.426
the same spiritual
wavelength.

12:40.426 --> 12:41.803
SEBASTIAN:
Oh, this is maddening.

12:41.803 --> 12:44.514
The rancid blood
that you two turnips

12:44.514 --> 12:47.141
bumbled on me was inadequate.

12:47.141 --> 12:51.020
But with enough fresh blood,
I will surely be restored.

12:51.020 --> 12:53.022
(laughs) Yeah.
No way we're doing that.

12:53.022 --> 12:54.315
Doing what?

12:54.315 --> 12:57.235
Not even if I can give you
what you want?

12:57.235 --> 12:58.695
Hmm?

12:58.695 --> 13:02.240
Elizabeth Saltzman
all to yourself.

13:02.240 --> 13:03.324
Without my competition.

13:03.324 --> 13:04.325
Come on, MG, what's he saying?

13:04.325 --> 13:05.743
Hold on.

13:05.743 --> 13:07.787
He's just getting
to the good part.

13:08.997 --> 13:11.249
Set me free, Milton,

13:11.249 --> 13:12.959
and I give you my word,

13:12.959 --> 13:16.087
I will leave
this town at once.

13:17.714 --> 13:20.466
He wants for us to wake him up.

13:28.433 --> 13:30.268
I know I'm forgetting something.

13:31.269 --> 13:32.729
Uh-oh.
Angst alert.

13:32.729 --> 13:33.813
Landon's journaling.

13:33.813 --> 13:36.399
Actually, Mr. Williams.

13:36.399 --> 13:37.400
Um...

13:37.400 --> 13:39.485
can I ask you
a personal question?

13:39.485 --> 13:40.611
Emma and I
aren't dating anymore.

13:40.611 --> 13:41.904
Okay? And, no.

13:41.904 --> 13:43.364
I don't know
if she's coming back.

13:43.364 --> 13:45.700
Actually, I was, um,

13:45.700 --> 13:47.243
I was actually wondering
how you knew

13:47.243 --> 13:50.538
you were ready to, um...

13:50.538 --> 13:52.248
you know, um...

13:52.248 --> 13:55.209
have sex...

13:55.209 --> 13:56.753
f-for, like,

13:56.753 --> 13:59.839
for, like, your first time.

14:01.382 --> 14:03.426
You mean your first time?

14:03.426 --> 14:05.386
Yeah.

14:05.386 --> 14:06.387
Oh.

14:06.387 --> 14:09.307
So you and Josie
are getting serious?

14:09.307 --> 14:12.977
I really don't want
to mess this up.
Gotcha.

14:12.977 --> 14:14.854
Um...

14:14.854 --> 14:16.856
All right, why don't you
take a seat, Landon.

14:18.483 --> 14:21.069
(clears throat)

14:21.069 --> 14:23.196
Well, I think

14:23.196 --> 14:24.947
that when you've found
the right person

14:24.947 --> 14:27.909
that you want to take
that step with...

14:27.909 --> 14:30.369
you just kinda know.

14:31.954 --> 14:34.624
It's-it's, uh,
it's like a look, right?

14:34.624 --> 14:37.627
It's this look and then...

14:39.128 --> 14:40.713
...you know.

14:42.256 --> 14:43.716
ALARIC:
Let me get this straight.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.510
You don't know who
this vampire is

14:45.510 --> 14:46.761
or how he got down there,

14:46.761 --> 14:48.930
just that he's
been desiccated

14:48.930 --> 14:50.264
for some unknown reason,

14:50.264 --> 14:53.267
(laughs) and he wants
you two to wake him up.

14:53.267 --> 14:54.685
Um... yeah.
Y-Yeah.

14:54.685 --> 14:56.062
That about--
that about covers it.

14:56.062 --> 14:57.772
Uh, unless I'm missing something

14:57.772 --> 15:00.691
I would say... let him rot.

15:00.691 --> 15:02.652
We don't even know
what he's doing down there

15:02.652 --> 15:04.237
in the first place.
Neither do I,

15:04.237 --> 15:06.405
but it's safe to say
that no one is desiccated

15:06.405 --> 15:07.698
for being too nice.

15:07.698 --> 15:09.408
Okay, but that doesn't mean
he's guilty.

15:09.408 --> 15:10.493
And even if he is,

15:10.493 --> 15:12.286
what crime equals
that kind of time?

15:12.286 --> 15:14.413
ALARIC:
Hypothetically,

15:14.413 --> 15:16.415
the slaughter
of a couple dozen villages.

15:17.708 --> 15:20.461
You're awfully quiet
over there, MG.

15:20.461 --> 15:22.046
Um...

15:22.046 --> 15:25.049
I'm... I'm leaning
Kaleb's way on this one.

15:25.049 --> 15:27.593
Vamps before...
non-vamps.

15:27.593 --> 15:29.720
That's not...

15:29.720 --> 15:31.889
I know I'm not
in charge here anymore.

15:31.889 --> 15:34.767
Now, if you want my vote,
I say don't do anything

15:34.767 --> 15:36.394
till you know more
about this guy.

15:36.394 --> 15:39.689
I-I respect that, Dr. Saltzman,

15:39.689 --> 15:41.274
but he said he'll leave town.

15:41.274 --> 15:44.026
We should at least give him
a shot to keep his word.

15:44.026 --> 15:47.989
And I vote we hold tight
like Dr. S. said.

15:47.989 --> 15:51.784
We, we figure out
what Sebastian really wants.

15:51.784 --> 15:54.495
How are we gonna do that?

15:54.495 --> 15:56.080
You leave that to me.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.331
(scoffs)

15:57.331 --> 15:58.958
All right?

16:03.462 --> 16:05.673
(sighs)
Thanks for the wisdom, man.

16:05.673 --> 16:08.092
To be honest, I'm surprised
you'd even want my opinion.

16:08.092 --> 16:09.010
You know,

16:09.010 --> 16:11.846
after you guys voted me out.

16:13.055 --> 16:15.516
Uh, look, uh...

16:15.516 --> 16:18.436
confidential ballot
and all...

16:18.436 --> 16:21.480
I am the only one who voted
for you to stay.

16:23.733 --> 16:25.276
LIZZIE:
I know you don't want
to think about this,

16:25.276 --> 16:27.403
but the real world
isn't resetting

16:27.403 --> 16:28.905
like this stupid one is,

16:28.905 --> 16:31.115
which means we are
rapidly approaching

16:31.115 --> 16:34.619
Josie's unexpected journey
there and back again. (gasps)

16:34.619 --> 16:35.786
Bear trap.

16:35.786 --> 16:37.538
(video game sound effect)

16:37.538 --> 16:38.581
I'm not gonna
tell them about be.

16:38.581 --> 16:39.832
Ugh. Why not?

16:39.832 --> 16:41.500
Because it's not gonna
change anything.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.919
Arrow.

16:42.919 --> 16:44.921
MAN (in distance):
Sorry!

16:44.921 --> 16:46.547
Be more careful
next time, Frank.

16:46.547 --> 16:49.467
It would change everything.

16:49.467 --> 16:51.886
No, it won't.

16:51.886 --> 16:53.471
When I saw that portal,
I knew that there

16:53.471 --> 16:55.473
was only one way to stop
the monsters from coming.

16:55.473 --> 16:57.683
I'm just gonna have to
jump back in and close it.

16:57.683 --> 17:00.519
Everyone's just gonna
forget me all over again.

17:00.519 --> 17:03.898
I was created to be the loophole
that ends Malivore.

17:03.898 --> 17:06.525
It's the only reason I exist.

17:06.525 --> 17:09.028
It's my destiny.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.655
(Minotaur growling)

17:13.199 --> 17:14.200
Run.

17:16.327 --> 17:18.663
(video game musical flourishes)
(roaring)

17:29.632 --> 17:31.342
LIZZIE:
Come on.

17:31.342 --> 17:33.719
The school should be
right through here.

17:39.642 --> 17:42.520
(video game musical flourish)

17:42.520 --> 17:43.562
KEEPER:
Oh, hey.

17:43.562 --> 17:45.064
Ready to take that deal yet?

17:45.064 --> 17:46.941
LIZZIE: I'm ready to take this
maze and shove it up your...

17:46.941 --> 17:48.901
Maze? Oh, no, this isn't a maze.
It's a labyrinth.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.069
Know the difference?

17:50.069 --> 17:51.487
Do I look like a nerd?
Hmm...

17:51.487 --> 17:54.615
A maze has multiple paths,
a labyrinth only has one.

17:54.615 --> 17:56.117
Exactly.
As I said before,

17:56.117 --> 17:58.536
there's only one way
this is going to end.

17:58.536 --> 18:02.456
Granted, her legs are amazing,
but she is a royal bitch.

18:02.456 --> 18:04.625
What are we gonna do?

18:04.625 --> 18:06.502
We take the deal.

18:06.502 --> 18:08.212
And I stay behind.

18:14.135 --> 18:16.220
It has to be me.
I'll take her place

18:16.220 --> 18:17.305
and then
you can be set free.

18:17.305 --> 18:19.640
See? Capital M-artyr complex,
Hope.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.892
The Minotaur travels
with the Keeper, right?

18:21.892 --> 18:23.811
So if I stay behind,
it'll be trapped with me.

18:23.811 --> 18:25.563
And since the monsters
only come one at a time,

18:25.563 --> 18:27.356
no other monsters ever will.

18:27.356 --> 18:32.194
Besides, it's not like
anyone's gonna know I'm gone.

18:32.194 --> 18:33.612
Except you.

bruh.

20:37.987 --> 20:39.155

20:39.155 --> 20:41.115

20:41.115 --> 20:42.283

20:51.876 --> 20:53.961

20:53.961 --> 20:55.838
I was hoping you were different.

20:55.838 --> 20:57.089
Guess not.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.883
(chuckles)

20:58.883 --> 21:02.094
I am in this state for the
very sin that you desire.

21:02.094 --> 21:04.889
I fed on so many humans
back in my day

21:04.889 --> 21:07.641
that it was no longer for
hunger, it was merely sport.

21:07.641 --> 21:10.728

they ran red with blood.

22:03.489 --> 22:04.823

22:06.867 --> 22:08.994

22:08.994 --> 22:10.788
Oh.
Sorry.

22:10.788 --> 22:12.331

no, I'm sorry.

22:12.331 --> 22:13.832
You?

22:13.832 --> 22:15.084

26:13.864 --> 26:16.074
Be careful with it.

26:16.074 --> 26:17.493
It's fragile.

26:17.493 --> 26:19.077
And if it breaks,

26:19.077 --> 26:22.206
you are not protected
from the Minotaur anymore.

26:24.500 --> 26:27.628
And my friend gets out, right?

26:27.628 --> 26:30.047

the eternal pain

26:30.047 --> 26:32.925
of the labyrinth, yes.

26:32.925 --> 26:35.969
That was very carefully worded.

26:35.969 --> 26:37.471
She dies, okay?

26:37.471 --> 26:39.014
That's what that
means. Uh...

26:39.014 --> 26:43.352
just think of it this way:
either she dies or you both do.

26:43.352 --> 26:45.103
It's self-preservation, kiddo.

26:45.103 --> 26:48.023
You're sick.
You know, when I
first took this deal,

26:48.023 --> 26:51.193
the previous Keeper told me
that this entire labyrinth

26:51.193 --> 26:53.028
was built by a sorcerer

26:53.028 --> 26:55.697
centuries ago to punish
a beautiful maiden

26:55.697 --> 26:57.699
who refused his affections.

26:57.699 --> 26:59.993
Because she didn't
exist just for him,

26:59.993 --> 27:02.162
he punished her forever.

27:02.162 --> 27:03.580
But she got out.

27:03.580 --> 27:06.416
She traded places with
another woman who came along,

27:06.416 --> 27:07.876
who then trapped
another woman,

27:07.876 --> 27:09.878
and so on
and so forth.

27:09.878 --> 27:13.131
I mean, you can't really
blame us for trying to escape,

27:13.131 --> 27:14.967
