39:20.792 --> 39:22.625
¶ boomtown ¶
you all right?

39:24.496 --> 39:26.696
You ever wanted to hear
something from someone

39:26.698 --> 39:28.898
For so long,
and then when you finally do,

39:28.900 --> 39:32.235
It just doesn't really matter
anymore?

39:32.237 --> 39:34.137
¶ take that train
till the tracks run out ¶

39:34.139 --> 39:35.672
Not sure
I know what you mean.

39:35.674 --> 39:37.841

to get out of here?

39:47.519 --> 39:48.985
Sure.

39:48.987 --> 39:52.389
¶ so much water

Woman:<i> A culture war</i>
<i> is brewing in country music</i>

39:54.693 --> 39:56.493
<i> After superstar</i>
<i> luke wheeler</i>

39:56.495 --> 39:58.928
<i> And conservative pundit</i>
<i> cynthia davis butted heads</i>

39:58.930 --> 40:00.363
<i> On her show</i>
<i> earlier today.</i>

40:00.365 --> 40:01.598
<i> That's right.</i>

40:01.600 --> 40:03.333
<i> Davis had accused wheeler</i>
<i> of, quote,</i>

40:03.335 --> 40:05.502
<i> "pushing</i>
<i> a homosexual agenda"</i>

40:05.504 --> 40:07.437

<i> And encouraged viewers</i>
<i> to call radio stations</i>

40:15.046 --> 40:17.013
<i> And demand airplay</i>
<i> for him.</i>

40:17.015 --> 40:19.783
<i> While wheeler appeared</i>
<i> on davis' show,</i>

40:19.785 --> 40:23.086
<i> There has been no public</i>
<i>comment from lexington himself.</i>

¶¶

40:50.949 --> 40:53.983
You okay?

40:57.589 --> 41:00.723
Well, this was
a very difficult decision.

41:00.725 --> 41:05.595
But after last night's events,
which give me serious pause...

41:05.597 --> 41:08.465
An emancipation will be granted,

41:08.467 --> 41:11.968
And maddie's contract
with highway 65 will be voided.

41:11.970 --> 41:14.938
I'm also issuing
a temporary restraining order

41:14.940 --> 41:16.940
Against deacon claybourne.

41:16.942 --> 41:18.641
And, ms. Jaymes,
I'd admonish you

41:18.643 --> 41:20.677
To refrain
from contacting your daughter

41:20.679 --> 41:23.346
During the same 15-day period,

41:23.348 --> 41:24.981
Otherwise, counsel will have us
all back in here

41:24.983 --> 41:27.116
With a request to restrain
if you should do so.

41:27.118 --> 41:29.953
This court is adjourned.

41:52.277 --> 41:55.211
Under the circumstances,
I wouldn't.

41:56.448 --> 41:58.648
