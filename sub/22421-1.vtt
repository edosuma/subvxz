with one of your lnsta-fans.

you could label it um... pop art.

of calling it. But I haven't...

50:01.665 --> 50:04.532
lots of sunscreen, a nice hat,
and your boyfriend obviously.

50:04.668 --> 50:06.454
Excuse me, miss, can I have your name?

50:06.586 --> 50:08.247
- Sorry?
- Can I have your name?

50:08.380 --> 50:10.667
- Oh, Ingrid.
- Last name?

50:10.799 --> 50:12.665
- Thorburn.
- Thorburn?

50:15.512 --> 50:17.799
Thorburn. There's no Thorburn
on this list.

50:18.724 --> 50:22.888
- I've been on the list for two weeks.
- She's actually with us.

50:23.020 --> 50:24.727
So, it's totally cool.

50:24.855 --> 50:28.564
So sorry, we got a full house.
It's VIPs only tonight.

50:29.317 --> 50:31.274
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
He was so mean.

50:31.403 --> 50:34.862
- You'll have to leave.
- Oh, really?

50:34.990 --> 50:37.982
How about I text you about the weekend
and send you all the information?

50:40.412 --> 50:43.450
- OK.
- Bye!

51:06.229 --> 51:10.348
- What do you want?
- Nothing, I just... came by to say hi.

51:10.484 --> 51:12.441
That's nice. Hi.

51:13.445 --> 51:15.777
- And I got you this.
- What is it?

51:15.906 --> 51:17.271
Open it.

51:25.582 --> 51:27.914
- Nice try, Ingrid.
- What? You don't like it?

51:28.043 --> 51:31.536
No, of course, I love it. That's why
I bought it on eBay two years ago.

51:31.671 --> 51:33.662
- Good looks though.
- There's more. Look.

51:39.429 --> 51:42.387
It's indica. Anybody who knows me
knows I only smoke sativa.

51:42.516 --> 51:44.223
An 8-ball
would've been more appropriate.

51:44.351 --> 51:46.888
Look, I'm trying.
That jacket cost like $400.

51:47.020 --> 51:49.887
8,000 dollars' worth of damage
to my truck.

51:50.023 --> 51:52.856
- I should throw you out.
- OK, I'm sorry.

51:53.401 --> 51:54.903
I did something really shitty.

51:55.028 --> 51:58.612
I took advantage of you
and I feel really bad about it. OK?

51:58.740 --> 52:00.151
I made a mistake.

52:01.618 --> 52:04.201
Can we please start over
and pretend it never happened?

52:04.913 --> 52:06.199
Like a reboot?

52:07.124 --> 52:10.162
OK! Yes.

52:10.293 --> 52:12.079
Like a reboot.

52:13.130 --> 52:14.712
Can I take you to dinner?

52:17.467 --> 52:18.798
Can I pick the place?

52:21.680 --> 52:26.140
Jim Carrey as the Riddler?
That should make you wanna go see it.

52:26.268 --> 52:27.349
Kilmer, Val Kilmer.

52:27.477 --> 52:29.809
He could kill everybody
in this fucking room right now.

52:29.938 --> 52:32.600
- Homie Joel? Joel Schumacher.
- Joel Schumacher.

52:32.732 --> 52:35.224
Yes, he was the best Batman, for sure.

52:35.360 --> 52:38.318
- Me too, I...
- No, he's the director.

52:38.446 --> 52:42.155
Joel. You like this place?

52:43.577 --> 52:46.865
- Yeah, it's cool.
- Chill spot. I mean, I know I like it.

52:46.997 --> 52:49.910
- Do you come here a lot?
- Way too often.

52:50.041 --> 52:52.578
- They'd charge me rent if they could.
- WOMAN: Dan?

52:52.711 --> 52:56.375
- Hey! Cindy. How are you?
- I'm so good, how are you?

52:56.506 --> 52:57.667
DAN: You're looking well.

52:57.799 --> 53:00.587
CINDY: It's so long since I've seen you.

53:00.719 --> 53:03.632
- DAN: You know, just working.
- CINDY: You're a busy man.

53:03.763 --> 53:05.219
Hey, we're on a date.

53:06.224 --> 53:08.386
- Oh, um... Sorry.
- All right.

53:12.230 --> 53:14.517
- (SLURPS DRINK)
- Oh.

53:14.649 --> 53:17.983
Catwoman has claws. I like that.

53:19.654 --> 53:23.397
- Why do you like Batman so much?
- What's not to like about Batman?

53:23.533 --> 53:26.070
I'm sorry, it's just...
I don't understand.

53:26.203 --> 53:29.412
He's just another superhero
like Spider-Man or Superman...

53:29.539 --> 53:32.372
Batman is the world's
greatest detective.

53:32.500 --> 53:35.913
Nothing radioactive bit him.
He's not from another planet.

53:36.046 --> 53:38.504
He's just like you or I.

53:38.632 --> 53:41.465
All Batman's powers
come from within him.

53:41.593 --> 53:43.675
He had enough will and enough focus

53:43.803 --> 53:46.511
to make himself greater
than what he was.

53:47.349 --> 53:48.464
And...

53:49.434 --> 53:53.177
In the beginning, before he's Batman,
he loses his parents.

53:53.313 --> 53:55.850
That definitely stuck with me.

53:56.441 --> 53:59.900
As an orphan, I definitely felt
a connection towards him.

54:00.028 --> 54:02.269
Oh, my God. You're an orphan?

54:02.405 --> 54:04.942
- I'm so sorry.
- It's fine.

54:05.075 --> 54:07.112
He made it through.
I'll make it through.

54:08.787 --> 54:10.528
What happened to your parents?

54:11.539 --> 54:14.668
It was a car accident. Yeah.

54:14.793 --> 54:18.707
It happened when I was a kid,
so I didn't know how to cope with it.

54:18.838 --> 54:23.958
So, at school, I would wear a Batman
mask. Make everybody call me Bruce.

54:24.094 --> 54:29.339
Pretend to be somebody else so it was
like it happened to somebody else.

54:30.850 --> 54:33.512
What about you? What about you?
What's your story?

54:33.645 --> 54:35.807
Um, yeah.
I don't really like Batman that much.

54:35.939 --> 54:37.600
No, no.

54:37.732 --> 54:41.396
With your mom. What's your story
with your mom? What happened?

54:44.531 --> 54:45.817
She had a heart attack.

54:47.200 --> 54:49.111
I mean, she was sick before that.

54:51.371 --> 54:53.032
You guys were close?

54:54.165 --> 54:58.580
We were really close.
I lived with her. And um...

54:58.712 --> 55:00.578
It's just been really hard.

55:01.298 --> 55:04.336
Because it was kinda like
I lost my best friend.

55:06.511 --> 55:08.798
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

55:08.930 --> 55:12.389
Getting too intense. I'm sorry.
You must think I'm the worst. I'm not.

55:12.517 --> 55:14.849
- Don't worry about all that.
- I'm sorry.

55:14.978 --> 55:16.514
Don't even talk to me about that.

55:16.646 --> 55:20.685
You don't ever have to apologize to me
about how you're feeling.

55:20.817 --> 55:23.605
It may seem like I don't care.
I put up a front.

55:23.737 --> 55:25.603
But I definitely care about you.

55:27.324 --> 55:28.735
Why?

55:31.328 --> 55:33.990
I mean... I don't know.

55:34.122 --> 55:37.285
It's just you have
a different kind of ring to you.

55:37.417 --> 55:41.832
You have a different kind of shine.
And I think somebody needs to appreci...

a house this weekend...

- Hmm.

57:33.783 --> 57:35.239
Of course, baby.

57:40.331 --> 57:42.117
You're the best.

57:43.543 --> 57:45.659
Hurry up, we're gonna be late.

57:45.795 --> 57:48.036
Do I gotta wear this shit
buttoned up all the way?

- I'm not being a baby.

57:51.426 --> 57:54.384
Stop that!
Don't do that in front of everybody.

57:54.512 --> 57:56.503

- Wait. Wait.

57:56.639 --> 57:58.300
- A couple of ground rules. OK?
- OK.

57:58.433 --> 58:01.471
I need you to tell everyone
that you're my boyfriend.

58:01.603 --> 58:04.812
It's a long story, but I just need you
to say that to everyone.

58:04.939 --> 58:09.183
I get it. I see that you dig me,
I dig you, I'll be your boyfriend.

58:09.319 --> 58:12.778
OK, whatever. And also, no Batman talk.

58:13.156 --> 58:15.318
What should I talk about?
I don't know these people.

58:15.450 --> 58:18.943

like food or clothes or Joan Didion.

58:19.078 --> 58:20.785
DAN: OK.

58:20.914 --> 58:22.496
Don't talk about comic books.

58:22.624 --> 58:24.535
These people don't care
about stuff like that.

I was at this tech start-up thing.

it bugged me a little bit

are you trying to make?"

01:02:44.093 --> 01:02:47.381
Oh, my God, I wanted to tell you
that I read The Deer <i>Park.</i>

01:02:47.513 --> 01:02:51.552
- The book you're obsessed with?
- Yeah. It's great, isn't it?

01:02:51.684 --> 01:02:53.846
- If you ever want to talk about...
- Oh, my God.

01:02:53.978 --> 01:02:56.015
Why don't you and Nicky come out
next weekend?

01:02:56.147 --> 01:02:58.479
We'll take you to Pappy's.
The crowd's a little sketchy,

01:02:58.608 --> 01:03:02.647
but they have the best live music
and the greatest desert vibes.

01:03:15.583 --> 01:03:16.664
INGRID: Ezra?

01:03:21.255 --> 01:03:25.169
Hey. Have you seen my phone?
Can't find it anywhere.

01:03:25.301 --> 01:03:26.712
Nope.

01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:31.012
What are you doing?

01:03:33.768 --> 01:03:35.759
I went skinny dipping.

01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:38.432
Alone?

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:42.936
Yeah.

01:03:48.616 --> 01:03:50.027
You OK?

01:03:52.036 --> 01:03:53.538
I'm not an artist.

01:03:55.873 --> 01:03:58.831
- I'm a fucking charlatan.
- No, you're not.

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:02.544
- Your paintings are awesome.
- You're my only sale.

01:04:04.006 --> 01:04:06.043
But Taylor said
they were really popular.

01:04:06.884 --> 01:04:09.046
She would say that, wouldn't she? Yeah.

01:04:11.347 --> 01:04:14.556
Everything's the best with her.

01:04:14.684 --> 01:04:18.518
"Have you been to this new restaurant?
It's the best!

01:04:18.646 --> 01:04:23.857
Have you tried these...
These new clothes are the best!

01:04:23.985 --> 01:04:25.942
It's the best! It's the best!
It's the best!"

01:04:26.070 --> 01:04:29.062
It's not the fucking best.
It's fucking exhausting.

01:04:34.745 --> 01:04:36.827
You know what? I know what you mean.

01:04:38.916 --> 01:04:41.658
When we were in Joshua Tree,
she told me this secret,

01:04:41.794 --> 01:04:43.376
and she told me not to tell anyone.

01:04:43.504 --> 01:04:46.747
But I walked in on her telling Harley
the same exact thing earlier.

01:04:46.883 --> 01:04:48.419
What secret?

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:53.303
I mean, obviously don't tell her
that I'm telling you,

01:04:53.431 --> 01:04:56.924
but I guess she has a plan
to buy the house next door to you guys,

01:04:57.059 --> 01:05:00.177
and turn it into some hotel slash store.

01:05:00.313 --> 01:05:02.896
And she wants to call it Desert D'Or.

01:05:03.608 --> 01:05:06.225
- Desert... Desert D'Or?
- Yeah.

01:05:08.195 --> 01:05:11.654
It's a reference to her favorite book,
you know, The Deer Park?

01:05:11.782 --> 01:05:14.035
The Deer Park is my favorite book.

01:05:15.661 --> 01:05:17.447
Taylor's never even read it.

01:05:20.249 --> 01:05:21.705
I miss the old Taylor.

01:05:21.834 --> 01:05:25.452
Back when she first moved here,
she didn't know anybody.

01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:31.004
She was, like,
this total preppy sorority chick.

01:05:31.135 --> 01:05:32.421
(LAUGHS) Yeah.

01:05:34.597 --> 01:05:36.804
EZRA:
I miss when it was just the two of us.

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:41.180
I'm sorry. I don't mean to burden you.

01:05:41.312 --> 01:05:44.304
- No, don't be sorry. It's OK.
- I'm just...

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:48.604
Sometimes I don't feel like I really
have anybody that I can talk to.

01:05:48.736 --> 01:05:50.602
- You know?
- Yeah.

01:05:52.823 --> 01:05:54.564
Especially with fucking Nicky around.

01:05:58.120 --> 01:05:59.326
(EZRA GRUNTS)

01:06:02.625 --> 01:06:04.411
(NICKY HUMS)

01:06:04.543 --> 01:06:05.874
Hey! Olga, come on in.

01:06:06.003 --> 01:06:07.459
(MUSIC PLAYS)

01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:12.462
- Nose beer for the lady?
- I'm good.

01:06:12.593 --> 01:06:13.833
(SNIFFS)

01:06:14.553 --> 01:06:16.135
(YELPS)

01:06:18.766 --> 01:06:21.884
- What's up?
- Nicky, where's my phone?

01:06:22.687 --> 01:06:24.223
Phone?

01:06:25.189 --> 01:06:28.181
- Come on. I know you took it.
- (LAUGHS)

01:06:28.317 --> 01:06:30.604
- Did you?
- You caught me!

01:06:30.736 --> 01:06:32.113
(LAUGHS)

01:06:32.238 --> 01:06:34.855
- Give it back.
- No. Stay, stay...

01:06:34.991 --> 01:06:38.575
- Come on, just give it back.
- Don't reach towards me.

01:06:38.703 --> 01:06:40.239
Sit down.

01:06:44.166 --> 01:06:45.702
You know, it's um...

01:06:46.544 --> 01:06:49.502
It's really funny
what you can discover about someone

01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:52.497
by just going through their phone.

01:06:53.592 --> 01:07:00.134
Oh, here. Look, this is... a picture
of you in my sister's bathroom.

01:07:00.266 --> 01:07:01.552
Weird.

01:07:01.684 --> 01:07:05.348
Here's a picture
of her medicine cabinet.

01:07:05.479 --> 01:07:07.857
Here is a picture of her sleeping.
There are a lot of those.

01:07:07.982 --> 01:07:10.098
- That's...
- Those are just a joke.

01:07:10.234 --> 01:07:12.396
- We were messing around.
- (LAUGHS)

01:07:12.528 --> 01:07:15.065
Actually, my favorite things
are the notes. You have uh...

01:07:15.197 --> 01:07:17.108
Taylor's favorite brunch spot,

01:07:17.241 --> 01:07:19.528
Taylor's favorite books,
Taylor's favorite movies.

01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:21.526
- OK, why are you...?
- Sit the fuck down!

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:26.031
Sit the fuck down.

01:07:35.051 --> 01:07:37.133
- What do you want?
- Me?

01:07:37.261 --> 01:07:40.253
Nothing.
I'm just looking out for my sister.

01:07:42.433 --> 01:07:43.923
What do you want?

01:07:44.935 --> 01:07:47.518
Look, I'm not a psychopath or anything.

01:07:47.646 --> 01:07:51.059
- I just... want to be her friend.
- Come on!

01:07:51.192 --> 01:07:54.059
Your password to your phone
is my sister's birthday.

01:07:54.195 --> 01:07:56.527
That's like Single White Female shit.

01:07:56.655 --> 01:07:59.067
Look, I just moved here,
I don't know anyone,

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:04.570
and Taylor has been so nice to me,
telling me all the best places to go...

01:08:04.705 --> 01:08:08.243
I'm not doing anything wrong.
OK? So please don't tell her.

01:08:08.375 --> 01:08:10.332
Sorry, Olga, but this is...

01:08:11.212 --> 01:08:13.795
It's just too good to let go. I mean...

01:08:14.965 --> 01:08:16.376
You're fucked.

01:08:19.804 --> 01:08:24.173
I'm gonna make a deal with you. I'm not
gonna give you your phone back. Um...

01:08:25.225 --> 01:08:30.345
But I'm willing to rent it out to you
for a very small fee.

01:08:31.607 --> 01:08:34.224
- How much?
- 5,000 a month.

01:08:34.359 --> 01:08:37.478
Disco Dan told me about your mom
and the sack full of cash.

01:08:37.613 --> 01:08:39.569
Ridiculous.
I don't have that kind of money.

01:08:39.698 --> 01:08:42.531
- OK, Taylor!
- Don't do that. Please don't do that.

01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:44.822
- Just...
- Oh.

01:08:45.746 --> 01:08:47.077
You're ready to make a deal then?

01:08:50.835 --> 01:08:54.828
5,000 a month, and I won't tell her
how much of a fucking loser you are.

01:08:55.756 --> 01:08:59.670
- I'll give you 5,000, that's it.
- You don't have any room to negotiate.

01:08:59.801 --> 01:09:01.542
I own you.

01:09:04.723 --> 01:09:05.884
Fine.

01:09:06.934 --> 01:09:11.929
Good. So, tomorrow night, we'll meet
at the Whole Foods parking lot.

01:09:12.064 --> 01:09:14.772
Gives you 24 hours to get the cash.
And um...

01:09:14.899 --> 01:09:18.109
Don't worry about deleting anything.
I forwarded the good stuff to myself.

01:09:18.237 --> 01:09:20.444
Ooh! This is my favorite part
of the song!

01:09:21.282 --> 01:09:22.488
Mmm!

01:09:23.658 --> 01:09:25.696

01:09:34.879 --> 01:09:36.916

- BOY 1: Oh, my God!
- BOY 2: What the hell's in that?

01:10:11.207 --> 01:10:13.494
You look cool with that piece of shit!
(LAUGHS)

01:10:15.836 --> 01:10:18.703
BOY 1: What, do you have Barbie dolls?

01:10:18.839 --> 01:10:20.671
'Cause you got fucking ripped off.

01:10:20.799 --> 01:10:23.712
I don't need to know how much
you paid for this shit.

01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:27.716
- INGRID: Excuse me.
- Yeah?

01:10:28.432 --> 01:10:31.641
I'll give one of you 200 bucks
if you punch me in the face.

01:10:32.436 --> 01:10:34.268
(ALL LAUGH)

01:10:34.396 --> 01:10:36.137
- I'm serious.
- Fuck off.

01:10:36.899 --> 01:10:38.515
OK, that's cool.

01:10:38.651 --> 01:10:42.189
If you pussies can't handle it,
I'll find someone else who can.

01:10:45.282 --> 01:10:47.865
- (LAUGHS) Dude, come on.
- All right, fuck it. I'll do it.

01:10:47.993 --> 01:10:50.109
- What?
- BOY 1: I said I'll do it.

01:10:50.246 --> 01:10:52.328
OK, great.

01:10:53.249 --> 01:10:56.241
- Hell, yeah, man!
- Where's the money?

01:11:06.303 --> 01:11:08.419
- You sure about this, right?
- Yeah.

01:11:08.555 --> 01:11:09.681
BOY 2: She's kinda hot.

01:11:09.807 --> 01:11:13.345
As hard as you can. Punch me.
Really hard, right in the face.

01:11:14.144 --> 01:11:15.680
Fucking... (YELLS)

01:11:15.813 --> 01:11:17.645
- Oh, shoot!
- Fucking...

01:11:17.773 --> 01:11:18.808
Shut up!

01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:21.399
- BOY 2: Oh, shit.
- (CRIES)

01:11:21.527 --> 01:11:23.188
You got fucked up.

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:26.654
I need to know what happened,
I need every detail.

01:11:26.782 --> 01:11:29.615
(SOBS) When I got home, I turned
the lights on and Nicky was there.

01:11:29.743 --> 01:11:32.451
I swear to God.
He was sitting there waiting for me,

01:11:32.579 --> 01:11:36.914
and he was fucked up on drugs or drunk
or something, I don't know.

01:11:37.042 --> 01:11:39.750
And I asked him for my phone back.
He wouldn't give it back to me.

01:11:39.878 --> 01:11:41.414
And then he said he wanted $50,000.

01:11:41.547 --> 01:11:43.504
. $?$:)SO!O?

01:11:44.216 --> 01:11:46.002
I told him
I didn't have that kind of money,

01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:53.053
but he said that you told him about
the money my mom gave me. Is that true?

01:11:53.183 --> 01:11:55.800
I don't know.
We were drinking this shitty...

01:11:55.936 --> 01:11:57.597
He kept asking me fucking questions.

01:11:57.730 --> 01:12:00.563
Why the fuck would you do that?
I told you how dangerous he is.

01:12:00.691 --> 01:12:04.355
- It doesn't sound like Nick.
- You've known him for one day.

01:12:04.486 --> 01:12:06.693
- So how would you know?
- I don't know.

01:12:06.822 --> 01:12:09.940
I've seen him do dirt,
we were supposed to go to Six Flags.

01:12:10.075 --> 01:12:13.818
- Fuck! We gotta call him.
- No.

01:12:13.954 --> 01:12:17.072
- What do you mean, no?
- No! Don't call him. Don't call him.

01:12:17.207 --> 01:12:19.289
He told me that if I told anyone,
he would kill me.

01:12:19.418 --> 01:12:21.955
- Don't try that shit.
- You don't know what he's capable of.

01:12:22.087 --> 01:12:26.081
I don't give a fuck, Ingrid! Look at
your face! What am I supposed to do?

01:12:26.216 --> 01:12:27.923
Look... Shh!

01:12:28.052 --> 01:12:30.510
(INGRID BREATHES HEAVILY) Look...

01:12:31.388 --> 01:12:34.050
We need to be smart about this, OK?

01:12:36.727 --> 01:12:38.388
I need you to be Batman.

01:12:39.730 --> 01:12:40.970
I am Batman.

01:12:42.274 --> 01:12:46.984
- We won't kill this dude, right?
- No. We'll just scare him a little bit.

01:12:47.112 --> 01:12:48.489
We'll take him out to the desert.

01:12:48.614 --> 01:12:51.276
You tell him that if he doesn't
leave me alone, you'll kill him.

01:12:51.408 --> 01:12:54.241
- We should call the police.
- No, no, come on!

01:12:54.370 --> 01:12:57.078
- This shit just seems sca...
- Hey! Keep it together.

01:12:57.206 --> 01:12:58.412
I thought you were Batman.

01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:01.373
I am Batman.
Batman don't do shit like this.

01:13:01.502 --> 01:13:04.290
I arrest people
and take them to Arkham Asylum.

01:13:04.421 --> 01:13:06.207
They get out a few months later.

01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:09.207
- And the cycle continues.
- He deserves this.

01:13:09.343 --> 01:13:13.712
- You saw my bruise. He fucked me up.
- That's right.

01:13:13.847 --> 01:13:17.181
He... He fucking hit you.

01:13:19.019 --> 01:13:20.350
(EXHALES)

01:13:21.688 --> 01:13:24.430
Tupac said there'd be days like this.

01:13:24.566 --> 01:13:25.897
- All right, let's...
- Wait.

01:13:31.407 --> 01:13:32.522
Love you.

01:13:34.368 --> 01:13:35.529
Shit.

01:13:51.593 --> 01:13:53.095
(GRUFF VOICE) Don't move.

01:13:54.012 --> 01:13:58.222
NICKY: Did you guys think this through?
I don't think you did.

01:13:58.350 --> 01:14:01.012
This should be behind the back.
Just pointing it out.

01:14:01.937 --> 01:14:05.350
Sad, but don't worry.
I'm good. I'll stay down.

01:14:06.358 --> 01:14:08.269
You know what?
I was thinking about this.

01:14:08.402 --> 01:14:11.986
Who would really want to kidnap me?

01:14:12.114 --> 01:14:15.573
There's not many people
except maybe um...

01:14:17.369 --> 01:14:19.076
Olga.

01:14:19.204 --> 01:14:23.619
Olga, is that you?
Who you got helping ya?

01:14:24.668 --> 01:14:26.079
Hello?

01:14:27.171 --> 01:14:31.586
I never knew I get car sick.
Well, I do have a bag over my head.

01:14:31.717 --> 01:14:34.129
- DAN: Shut the fuck up.
- NICKY: Gentle.

01:14:34.261 --> 01:14:38.801

then what's the point of living?

01:31:02.915 --> 01:31:05.782
Yeah, so I guess
I'm just making this video

01:31:05.918 --> 01:31:10.003
so you guys can see the real me
at least once.

01:31:13.176 --> 01:31:14.883

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Take it easy.
You've been through a lot.

Hey, what's up, Ingrid?

01:33:23.264 --> 01:33:25.426
NURSE: Dan's the reason
you're still with us.

01:33:25.933 --> 01:33:29.051
He saw your video online and called 911.

Can you give us a minute?

01:33:42.158 --> 01:33:46.743
Like the new whip? I know, I'm shining.
It's not the Batmobile, but it'll do.

01:33:47.455 --> 01:33:50.789

Baby, where did you go?
Why did you leave?

01:34:03.554 --> 01:34:08.219
I mean, are you gonna disappear on me
again in another three weeks?

Yeah, yeah.

How you feeling?

01:34:17.902 --> 01:34:21.861
- I feel stupid.
- Don't say that. Why so serious?

DAN: Come on. Nobody wants to see this.

01:34:30.039 --> 01:34:32.497
It's OK. I know what'll cheer you up.
