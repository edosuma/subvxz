04:26.868 --> 04:30.638
Now, opening up for a big boy
country star like Caleb Crawford

04:31.438 --> 04:33.007
could give Torn Hearts
just the break

04:33.074 --> 04:34.374
you've been looking for.

how do you find the time?

05:02.870 --> 05:05.239
I owed Richie a favor.
Turns out it was a pleasure.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.808
Told you.
You did.

05:06.908 --> 05:07.842
So, just to be clear,

05:07.909 --> 05:10.144
you... you liked
our last song just now?

05:10.310 --> 05:12.880
What about it? The energy?

05:13.047 --> 05:14.414
The lyrics? The tempo?

05:14.515 --> 05:16.617
Jordan just needs
constant feedback.

It's a part of her process
as an artist.

go hit the hay.

We've... we've got a lot
going on in the morning.

one drink with you.

a few drinks.

06:06.567 --> 06:09.469
Fuck are you talking about?
Do I look like a cliché?

06:09.637 --> 06:11.205
They're clichés for a reason.

06:11.739 --> 06:13.274
Oh, that won't be necessary.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.742
Yes, it is.

32:34.522 --> 32:35.690
Just like me.

32:36.858 --> 32:38.693
Well, we both work hard.

32:40.060 --> 32:43.263
Yeah, but you work just
that little bit harder, right?

32:44.465 --> 32:46.233
I doubt she's staying up
late at night,

32:46.333 --> 32:49.504
writing melodies and songs.
Mm-mm.

32:49.970 --> 32:53.073
It is clear who's getting
her beauty sleep.

32:57.579 --> 33:00.615
(SIGHS) Damn.
Shit!

33:01.248 --> 33:03.016
We get a lot of critters
around here.

33:03.317 --> 33:07.187
You... you cut my finger.
Hey. Is everything okay?

33:07.254 --> 33:09.891
Yeah, Jordan just got spooked
by a little bug.

33:09.990 --> 33:12.392
She just cut my finger.
Let me see.

33:13.026 --> 33:14.294
You done with your call?

33:14.394 --> 33:15.429
Yeah.

33:16.598 --> 33:17.699
Let's go.

33:25.472 --> 33:28.810
HARPER: Where'd you two meet?
The Bluebird Café two years ago.

33:29.109 --> 33:31.646
Yeah, we were waiting around
all day to get onstage,

33:31.713 --> 33:35.048
and just sort of got to chatting
and getting to know each other.

33:35.482 --> 33:37.084
We both were
relatively new to town,

33:37.217 --> 33:38.853
but Jordan had been there
a little bit longer

33:38.920 --> 33:40.020
doing the open mics.

33:40.287 --> 33:44.091
And then they called Jordan up
as the last act of the day.

33:44.759 --> 33:46.528
And Leigh started crying.

33:46.694 --> 33:49.062
(CHUCKLES)
Only a little bit.

33:49.263 --> 33:50.832
I just couldn't catch a break.

33:50.899 --> 33:53.668
I had been trying
to get onstage forever.

33:54.334 --> 33:57.304
And then Jordan
invited me up with her.

33:57.739 --> 33:59.106
Yeah. Yeah.

33:59.206 --> 34:02.309
It was, uh, we winged it,
but it was great.

34:02.409 --> 34:04.579
Yeah.
It was meant to be. (CHUCKLES)

34:04.712 --> 34:07.114
You know, I... I think
we needed each other.

34:08.114 --> 34:10.918
So, you shared your coveted slot
with a stranger?

34:11.051 --> 34:13.219
Yeah. Yeah,
it wouldn't be the first time.

34:18.592 --> 34:21.596
Well, you know, I... I just,
I... I felt so bad for her.

34:21.696 --> 34:25.800
Um, but luckily she's talented,
so it all worked out.

34:26.099 --> 34:27.768
Yeah, she is something.

34:29.536 --> 34:30.469
I noticed that

34:30.572 --> 34:32.507
the moment you walked
in the door.

34:32.706 --> 34:33.507
You have that...

34:33.741 --> 34:36.208
that extra something special,
don't you?

34:39.013 --> 34:40.380
You're a star.

34:41.380 --> 34:44.018
Yeah, well,
you know, um, people say

34:44.083 --> 34:46.654
that we both have
a lot of talent, so...

34:46.788 --> 34:48.188
You got a boyfriend?

34:48.388 --> 34:50.658
I got--
Oh, she has a boyfriend.

34:50.757 --> 34:51.993
You don't like her boyfriend?

34:52.125 --> 34:53.761
Yeah, she knows
I don't like him.

34:54.194 --> 34:55.697
(CLEARS THROAT)

34:56.931 --> 34:59.099
Well, I like him, so...

35:00.835 --> 35:02.402
Well, Harper doesn't like him.

35:02.904 --> 35:03.938

35:04.038 --> 35:05.873

right now, please?

(LAUGHS)

35:12.446 --> 35:14.181

is my sister

35:14.716 --> 35:16.283
had an older boyfriend.

35:17.284 --> 35:18.385
Couple of times.

35:18.786 --> 35:22.422
Always some asshole
with power and prestige.

35:22.523 --> 35:26.460
Not her worst laid plan,
although I hated it at the time.

35:27.862 --> 35:28.763
Interesting.

35:28.830 --> 35:31.198
Nobody wanted to hear
what we had to say.

35:31.331 --> 35:32.634
Not in Nashville.

35:32.767 --> 35:36.269
But Hope, she always knew that
you couldn't get what you wanted

35:36.336 --> 35:37.639
just 'cause you wanted it.

35:38.138 --> 35:41.341
She knew you had to strategize.
Be ruthless.

35:41.709 --> 35:42.844
Sneaky.

35:43.310 --> 35:46.480
And, you know, that actually
worked for a while.

35:47.081 --> 35:49.717
But what'd we get in the end?

35:50.118 --> 35:53.788

36:33.094 --> 36:36.463

for Hope taking her own life.

you know.

you better learn
how to take a shot.

seen or heard from you

I'm sorry.

to tell them that. (CHUCKLES)

to believe me.

that you decided

01:00:10.177 --> 01:00:10.978
to come by right now.

from you, Richie.

with each other,

01:07:46.133 --> 01:07:48.368
that you made it
out of the basement.

talking to Richie,

01:07:50.905 --> 01:07:52.239

01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:55.710
Torn Hearts with Harper Dutch
is a great idea.

01:07:55.810 --> 01:07:57.444

Yeah, no.

No, I heard what he said.
It wasn't that.

lay down part of that song

is so bad in this house.
