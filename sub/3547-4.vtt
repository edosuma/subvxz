00:00.125 --> 00:02.041
<i>Previously on </i>Desperate Housewives.

00:02.125 --> 00:05.333
A reporter just did a story on homeless
teens, and my son was one of them.

00:05.417 --> 00:06.458
Oh, my God.

00:06.542 --> 00:08.000
<i>Orson found Andrew.</i>

00:08.083 --> 00:11.917
Have I done stuff for money
that I'm not proud of? Yeah, sure.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.375
<i>And the prodigal son returned.</i>

00:17.792 --> 00:19.667
<i>Mike fell into a coma.</i>

00:19.750 --> 00:22.458
- What could be more romantic?
- I can think of something.

00:22.542 --> 00:26.083
<i>And Susan fell into the arms</i>
<i>of another man</i>

00:26.166 --> 00:27.750
<i>a bit too soon.</i>

00:30.875 --> 00:34.625
<i>The day Mike Delfino woke</i>
<i>from his coma,</i>

00:34.709 --> 00:37.458
<i>Edie Britt was the first to know.</i>

00:41.500 --> 00:43.917
<i>Once she was sure</i>
<i>he was responsive...</i>

00:44.000 --> 00:45.709
Mike?

00:47.792 --> 00:50.625
<i>...Edie decided to share</i>
<i>the good news with others.</i>

00:50.709 --> 00:53.583
Code red! Code red!

00:53.667 --> 00:56.041
My friend just woke up from his coma.

00:56.125 --> 00:59.542
<i>And that is how word began to spread.</i>

00:59.625 --> 01:02.458
<i>Mike's physician, Dr Craig,</i>
<i>was busy with a patient</i>

01:02.542 --> 01:04.792
<i>when he first heard the news.</i>

01:04.875 --> 01:08.333
<i>Not long after, he called his Aunt Ida,</i>

01:08.417 --> 01:10.959
<i>who was busy knitting a sweater.</i>

01:11.041 --> 01:15.917
<i>She told Lynette Scavo,</i>
<i>who was busy watering her lawn.</i>

01:16.000 --> 01:18.208
<i>And she told her husband, Tom,</i>

01:18.291 --> 01:20.792
<i>who was busy playing</i>
<i>a computer game.</i>

01:20.875 --> 01:23.250
<i>He then e-mailed his friend, Carlos,</i>

01:23.333 --> 01:27.709
<i>who was busy plotting strategy</i>
<i>with his divorce lawyer.</i>

01:27.792 --> 01:31.458
<i>And Carlos called</i>
<i>his soon-to-be ex-wife, Gabrielle,</i>

01:31.542 --> 01:35.000
<i>who was busy</i>
<i>doing the same with hers.</i>

01:35.083 --> 01:38.709
<i>Yes, word of Mike's</i>
<i>miraculous recovery</i>

01:38.792 --> 01:41.458
<i>spread quickly</i>
<i>throughout Wisteria Lane</i>

01:41.542 --> 01:45.917
<i>and stopped cold</i>
<i>everyone's busy, busy life.</i>

01:47.208 --> 01:49.208
<i>Everyone, that is,</i>

01:49.291 --> 01:52.500
<i>except for Susan Mayer,</i>

01:52.583 --> 01:54.750
<i>who was busy doing something</i>

01:54.834 --> 01:58.542
<i>she would soon wish she hadn't.</i>

02:42.750 --> 02:45.458
<i>Edward Sibley was</i>
<i>the beloved founder</i>

02:45.542 --> 02:47.458
<i>of the town of Fairview.</i>

02:47.542 --> 02:51.291
<i>Prior to that, he was best known</i>
<i>as a bootlegger,</i>

02:52.500 --> 02:56.542
<i>a womaniser and a horse thief.</i>

02:57.250 --> 03:02.000
<i>Of course, no one remembers</i>
<i>those parts of Edward's past.</i>

03:02.083 --> 03:06.375
<i>Luckily for him,</i>
<i>history is designed to be rewritten.</i>

03:07.417 --> 03:10.417
<i>And no one knew this</i>
<i>better than Bree Hodge.</i>

03:10.500 --> 03:12.458
So, you're just gonna lie to people?

03:12.542 --> 03:13.834
Oh, I'm not talking about a lie,

03:13.917 --> 03:17.125
just a polite fiction to explain
to everybody where you've been.

03:17.208 --> 03:18.500
I mean, we can't possibly tell them

03:18.583 --> 03:21.959
that you've been living on skid row
sleeping in a cardboard box.

03:22.041 --> 03:24.792
So why do I have to go
to this history fair anyway?

03:24.875 --> 03:26.125
I mean, it's just
some dumb school contest.

03:26.208 --> 03:28.250
We all know Danielle's not gonna win.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.709
- She never wins anything.
- Is it weird eating off plates?

03:30.792 --> 03:31.917
Because if you were more comfortable,

03:32.000 --> 03:34.208
you could just eat
straight out of the garbage.

03:34.291 --> 03:37.667
This is a family event
and we're all gonna enjoy it together.

03:37.750 --> 03:38.959
Now, Danielle, stop sniping

03:39.041 --> 03:40.959
and start thinking of an alibi
for your brother.

03:41.041 --> 03:42.667
I know, we could say he joined a cult

03:42.750 --> 03:44.709
and we had to kidnap
and deprogramme him.

03:44.792 --> 03:47.875
That would certainly spare the family
some embarrassment.

03:47.959 --> 03:50.125
Why not throw in a killing spree, too?

03:50.208 --> 03:53.417
Well, here's a thought.
We say he was at drama camp.

03:53.500 --> 03:56.834
It reflects Andrew's interest
in the performing arts,

03:56.917 --> 04:01.125
while giving us a private joke to savour
about the drama of his estrangement.

04:02.542 --> 04:04.834
Yeah, he is always like that.

04:06.500 --> 04:09.125
Guys, why can't we just tell the truth?

04:10.583 --> 04:15.208
I got out of line, you kicked me out,
I lived on the street, I came back home.

04:16.917 --> 04:20.000
We'll need a name
for this drama camp.

04:20.750 --> 04:22.959
We got ties here, people.

04:23.041 --> 04:25.875
Designer ties, two for a dollar.

04:27.709 --> 04:32.083
Do you like those barbells?
Make me an offer. I'm feeling generous.

04:34.333 --> 04:37.291
Here's the customer
I've been waiting for.

04:38.125 --> 04:40.208
Carlos, I see you got my flier.

04:40.291 --> 04:43.667
You're having a garage sale featuring
menswear and sporting equipment.

04:43.750 --> 04:47.750
I need cash. And you don't expect me
to sell my stuff, do you?

04:47.959 --> 04:51.792
Those are my good cuff links.
Those are my CDs.

04:51.875 --> 04:55.041
Oh, my God. This is my baby blanket.
My mama knitted this.

04:55.125 --> 04:57.375
And it pains me to sell it.

04:57.458 --> 05:00.625
It's just that my lawyer told me
what you're offering for spousal support

05:00.709 --> 05:02.291
and I can't get by on that.

05:02.375 --> 05:05.250
Hey, I am doing the best that I can.
I got a few deals in the pipeline.

05:05.333 --> 05:07.208
But I'm not making near
as much as I used to.

05:07.291 --> 05:09.083
So I should be punished?

05:09.166 --> 05:10.458
Attention, shoppers!

05:10.542 --> 05:15.041
For the next 20 minutes,
free golf club with every purchase.

05:15.125 --> 05:16.583
Gabby, I'm trying to be civil.

05:16.667 --> 05:20.417
But if you don't knock it off right now,
I swear, the gloves are coming off.

05:20.500 --> 05:24.291
Honey, the gloves aren't just off,
they're 70% off.

05:24.375 --> 05:26.834
Get your cashmere gloves.

05:31.542 --> 05:35.542
Hey, Parker, where's your uniform?
You got your game in an hour.

05:35.625 --> 05:37.500
No, I don't. I quit.

05:37.583 --> 05:39.792
- What?
- I hate baseball.

05:39.875 --> 05:41.917
Daddy said
I don't have to play it any more.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.083
Well, Daddy should have checked
with Mommy,

05:44.166 --> 05:47.083
so she could have a chance
to tell him why he's wrong.

05:47.166 --> 05:49.291
Hey, you're playing.

05:49.375 --> 05:52.792
But, Mom, I suck. Everybody says so.

05:52.875 --> 05:55.417
That's why they made up
a fake position for me.

05:55.500 --> 05:56.750
It is not fake.

05:56.834 --> 05:58.250
There is not a team I know

05:58.333 --> 06:01.625
that could get along
without their backup far right fielder.

06:02.542 --> 06:04.917
Okay, come on. Let's go practise.

06:07.333 --> 06:09.709
All right, let's try it again.
Nice and easy.

06:09.792 --> 06:13.500
Watch the ball, hit the bat. You ready?
You can do it. Here we go.

06:14.917 --> 06:17.792
Okay, Parker, I keep telling you,
you gotta keep your eyes open.

06:17.875 --> 06:19.750
How are you gonna hit the ball
when you're doing this?

06:19.834 --> 06:22.250
You threw it too fast. Throw slower.

06:22.333 --> 06:25.125
If I threw any slower,
we would be bowling.

06:25.208 --> 06:28.458
Hey. Hey, what you guys doing?

06:28.542 --> 06:30.959
I'll tell you what
we're not doing, quitting.

06:31.041 --> 06:32.625
Hey, buddy,
did you change your mind?

06:32.709 --> 06:33.792
No.

06:34.458 --> 06:36.583
Lynette, I told him
that he didn't have to play any more.

06:36.667 --> 06:38.000
He's got five more games
of the season.

06:38.083 --> 06:40.625
He made a commitment.
He's gonna see it through.

06:40.709 --> 06:42.792
But, Lynette, he doesn't like it.

06:42.875 --> 06:44.625
And if you haven't noticed,
he kind of sucks.

06:44.709 --> 06:47.208
Yeah, well, that's not the point.
What kind of message are we sending

06:47.291 --> 06:49.166
if we let him quit
whenever the going gets rough?

06:49.250 --> 06:50.500
Honey, it is kid's baseball.

06:50.583 --> 06:52.500
It's a way to kill three hours
before they eat pizza.

06:52.583 --> 06:53.834
Why are you being such a hard-ass?

06:53.917 --> 06:56.917
Well, it's called parenting, Tom.
Watch and learn.

07:01.375 --> 07:05.500
Okay, P-Dog, this is a curve ball.

07:09.208 --> 07:12.500
Again, opening the eyes.
Can't stress it enough.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.709
Are you sure it's okay
if we stay another day?

07:17.792 --> 07:19.875
Well, let's see.
What excuse did we use

07:19.959 --> 07:22.208
when we had
this conversation yesterday?

07:22.291 --> 07:24.083
That we work hard
and we deserve to relax.

07:24.166 --> 07:26.709
No, I believe that was
last Thursday's rationale.

07:26.792 --> 07:28.834
- Fresh air is good for us?
- Tuesday.

07:28.917 --> 07:32.542
Okay, here's one. Julie needs to spend
more time bonding with her father.

07:32.625 --> 07:34.000
Brilliant.

07:35.375 --> 07:38.583
If we keep this up,
we could stay here till Christmas.

07:40.333 --> 07:42.417
You know, sometimes
when you smile like that,

07:42.500 --> 07:45.250
it really
makes me think that...

07:45.542 --> 07:47.291
What? What were you gonna say?

07:47.375 --> 07:49.667
Well, it makes me think
that I could love you.

07:52.083 --> 07:56.333
I don't mean love in the swooning
schoolboy sense, you know,

07:56.417 --> 07:59.125
fireworks exploding, bells ringing.

07:59.208 --> 08:01.417
To me, it's about this,

08:01.500 --> 08:05.542
a mundane task that's suddenly a joy
because of who you're doing it with.

08:05.625 --> 08:08.000
That's love to me.

08:08.083 --> 08:09.667
Someone to fluff while you fold,

08:09.750 --> 08:13.458
someone to whisper to
at a boring party, someone to...

08:13.709 --> 08:18.166
Do you mind?
You're kind of drowning out the bells.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.500
So I am.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.375
I think I can feed myself now.

08:30.458 --> 08:34.709
You said that yesterday and I wound up
with a cleavage full of pudding.

08:34.792 --> 08:39.250
You heard the therapist. It's gonna be
weeks before you're up and running.

08:41.667 --> 08:44.834
I just wanna get home, unpack.

08:44.917 --> 08:48.125
You just let home come to you, okay?

08:48.208 --> 08:50.250
The whole street's dying to see you.

08:50.333 --> 08:53.834
Bree is even bakin' you a peach pie.

08:54.959 --> 08:56.583
She's the redhead, right?

08:57.792 --> 08:58.834
Right.

08:59.333 --> 09:03.208
Husband's the doctor. Rex.

09:05.417 --> 09:07.667
Rex is dead.

09:09.041 --> 09:11.333
Really? When did that happen?

09:11.417 --> 09:14.500
- About a year and a half ago.
- What?

09:14.583 --> 09:17.792
- Yeah. You were at his funeral.
- What are you talking about?

09:17.875 --> 09:21.834
That's not possible.
I just met him right before my accident.

09:24.583 --> 09:27.500
Mike, what year is it?

09:28.917 --> 09:31.583
2004. Why?

09:34.500 --> 09:36.917
It's called retrograde memory loss.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.500
It's caused by the swelling
and frontal-lobe damage.

09:40.583 --> 09:43.417
You say he's lost two whole years?

09:43.500 --> 09:45.542
Yeah. Is that unusual?

09:45.625 --> 09:49.250
Well, patients more typically lose
several weeks.

09:50.875 --> 09:53.125
The damage may be more severe
than we thought.

09:53.208 --> 09:55.333
Well, do you think
he'll get his memory back?

09:55.417 --> 09:58.250
He might. At least partially.

09:58.333 --> 10:00.583
You could be of some assistance
with that.

10:00.667 --> 10:03.208
- How?
- Bring him some personal belongings.

10:03.291 --> 10:05.166
Photos, letters.

10:05.250 --> 10:08.500
He's gonna need some help
to remember what he can't.

10:10.834 --> 10:14.250
Well, I'm sure
I could fill in a few blanks.

10:26.333 --> 10:30.083
Hey, did I tell you that Burnham Fox
is looking for a new creative director?

10:30.166 --> 10:33.500
PR? What makes you think
I wanna work for a PR firm?

10:33.583 --> 10:37.709
Easy hours, big paycheque,
access to great parties.

10:37.792 --> 10:39.000
Yeah, what was I thinking?

10:39.083 --> 10:41.959
Honey, we agreed
that I would chase my dreams

10:42.041 --> 10:46.000
- and that ain't it.
- Okay, I was just making conversation.

10:46.083 --> 10:47.834
- Batter up.
- Is he up?

10:47.917 --> 10:49.250
Come on.

10:51.542 --> 10:54.500
Come on, Parker.
Keep your eye on the ball.

10:58.458 --> 10:59.875
Strike one.

11:00.709 --> 11:04.542
Hey, people. He's just a kid, okay?
Come on.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.083
Strike two.

11:08.667 --> 11:10.875
Hey, hey. That is not helpful.

11:10.959 --> 11:13.917
It only takes one, Parker.
Only takes one.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.417
It's not your son's fault.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.709
He's just up
against the best pitcher in the league.

11:17.792 --> 11:19.458
That guy's a machine. Who is that kid?

11:19.542 --> 11:21.917
Nicky Abbott.
He's a neighbour of mine.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.959
Kid's got an arm like a 13-year-old.

11:26.959 --> 11:29.417
Strike three. You're out.

11:31.542 --> 11:34.208
I'm gonna go buy him ice cream.

11:35.625 --> 11:39.125
It's okay, P-Dog.
You're gonna get 'em the next inning.

11:50.250 --> 11:54.375
So, tell me, what else do you know
about this Nicky kid?

11:56.750 --> 11:59.583
- You're short 50 cents.
- Please. That's all I got.

11:59.667 --> 12:03.417
Hey. Give the kid what he wants.

12:05.583 --> 12:07.959
Thanks. Hey, aren't you
Parker Scavo's mom?

12:08.041 --> 12:09.834
That's right.

12:09.917 --> 12:12.583
Come. Walk with me.

12:13.792 --> 12:18.000
- So, money's a little tight, huh?
- A little.

12:18.083 --> 12:19.709
Yeah, I heard your old man's
out of work.

12:19.792 --> 12:21.458
That's gotta be tough.

12:21.542 --> 12:23.542
Yeah. They cut my allowance.

12:23.625 --> 12:25.917
No. A kid's gotta have an allowance.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.041
How else are you gonna buy
the things you want, right?

12:29.125 --> 12:31.458
Like that cotton candy.

12:31.542 --> 12:34.792
That's a little piece of heaven, huh?

12:34.875 --> 12:37.250
Hey, I got an idea.

12:37.333 --> 12:39.291
Maybe we could help each other out.

12:39.375 --> 12:41.208
My son's having a little trouble
hitting the ball.

12:41.291 --> 12:43.792
- Yeah, I saw that.
- Yeah.

12:46.208 --> 12:48.458
Ever seen one of these?

13:03.542 --> 13:05.333
Carlos, what are you doing here?

13:05.417 --> 13:07.333
I mean, besides lowering
my property value?

13:07.417 --> 13:11.208
I had a little news, and I wanted
to see your face when I delivered it.

13:12.208 --> 13:15.500
I'm tired of fighting,
so I called my lawyer

13:15.583 --> 13:18.750
and told him to give in
to your demands for spousal support.

13:18.834 --> 13:20.083
Really?

13:21.583 --> 13:23.417
Wow. Well, thank you.

13:25.542 --> 13:28.333
Okay, you've seen my face.
Now you can beat it.

13:28.417 --> 13:30.000
Wait, there's more.

13:30.959 --> 13:33.834
Since I'm gonna be giving you
all that money,

13:34.000 --> 13:37.750
I have to cut back on some stuff,
like the rent on my apartment.

13:37.834 --> 13:40.041
But the good news is,
according to my lawyer,

13:40.125 --> 13:43.125
I'm completely
within my rights to do this.

13:48.875 --> 13:50.542
Honey, I'm home.

13:53.625 --> 13:55.709
Wait. You can't stay here.

13:55.792 --> 13:59.166
Now there's the face
that I was looking for.

14:02.083 --> 14:03.458
Batter up.

14:13.125 --> 14:14.959
Strike one.

14:15.041 --> 14:18.458
Wow. That was kinda slow.
His arm must be getting tired.

14:18.542 --> 14:22.000
Yeah, well, after all those fastballs.

14:22.083 --> 14:25.125
Come on, Parker. You can do it.

14:29.834 --> 14:31.333
Strike two.

14:43.041 --> 14:45.208
Oh, my God!

15:27.500 --> 15:29.083
- Mr Faladi.
- Yes.

15:29.166 --> 15:32.000
I cannot thank you enough for getting
Danielle interested in history.

15:32.083 --> 15:35.375
She has never worked so hard
on a project before.

15:35.458 --> 15:39.792
Well, don't tell anyone,
but she is my favourite student.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.542
Oh, and it's so good to see
that Andrew's back.

15:43.625 --> 15:46.125
Where's he been all this time?

15:46.208 --> 15:49.875
Drama camp.
A very prestigious drama camp.

16:06.959 --> 16:08.542
- Do I know you?
- Yeah.

16:08.625 --> 16:11.792
You gave me a ride
in your black sedan once.

16:12.750 --> 16:15.041
You know,
the one with the reclining seats?

16:17.500 --> 16:19.417
Excuse me.

16:21.500 --> 16:24.291
Wasn't that Dr Keck? You know him?

16:24.667 --> 16:28.333
Yeah. Yeah. We met at drama camp.

16:28.792 --> 16:31.041
Oh, good lord. You mean...

16:31.125 --> 16:35.291
Yeah. I performed for him once.

16:35.375 --> 16:39.291
- Are you all right?
- I'll be all right. I'm fine.

16:39.375 --> 16:41.291
Howard Keck?

16:41.375 --> 16:45.333
You sure? I mean, he's a very
respected member of the community.

16:45.417 --> 16:47.959
Yeah. They all were.

16:56.250 --> 17:00.542
What were you and Andrew talking
about today at the fair?

17:01.792 --> 17:03.125
Nothing.

17:04.375 --> 17:06.250
I was gonna make some cocoa.
Would you like some?

17:06.333 --> 17:09.834
Orson, I saw the two of you whispering
right after Dr Keck ran off.

17:09.917 --> 17:11.458
What happened?

17:17.667 --> 17:20.583
Look, Andrew asked me
not to say anything,

17:20.667 --> 17:22.792
but I don't want there to be
any secrets between us,

17:22.875 --> 17:25.625
so please don't let him know I told you.

17:25.709 --> 17:28.166
Well, of course not. What is it?

17:28.834 --> 17:30.500
How to put this?

17:31.792 --> 17:36.542
When Andrew was on the street,
he didn't just beg for money.

17:36.625 --> 17:41.041
At times he, well,
he did things to earn it.

17:41.125 --> 17:44.250
Oh, good. I mean, I'd hate to think
he had no work ethic at all.

17:45.667 --> 17:47.375
What I mean is,

17:48.375 --> 17:53.417
men hired him to do things,

17:53.500 --> 17:55.917
things he wasn't very proud of.

17:56.250 --> 18:00.166
- Yard work?
- Afraid not.

18:00.250 --> 18:03.250
Orson, you're scaring me.
Did he do something awful?

18:03.333 --> 18:06.625
No. No, not awful.
I mean, people do it all the time.

18:06.709 --> 18:10.875
I do it with you.
I just don't pay you for it.

18:15.375 --> 18:17.250
I think someone could use a cocoa.

18:21.917 --> 18:25.500
Look, we mustn't judge Andrew.
He was desperate.

18:25.583 --> 18:28.667
I'll never forgive myself.
It's all my fault for pushing him away.

18:28.750 --> 18:30.667
Bree, don't do that to yourself.

18:30.750 --> 18:32.959
The important thing now is
that he's home and he's safe.

18:33.041 --> 18:34.917
How does this Dr Keck fit into all this?

18:35.000 --> 18:38.250
I mean, is he treating Andrew
for some awful disease?

18:38.333 --> 18:42.333
Actually, I think he was
one of Andrew's clients.

18:42.417 --> 18:45.542
Howard Keck? Now, that's ridiculous.
He's got a wife and a daughter.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.917
He plays
on Tom Scavo's bowling team.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.250
Well, it's clearly not
the only team he plays for.

18:51.333 --> 18:54.834
This is a nightmare.
An absolute nightmare.

18:55.917 --> 18:58.583
Please don't cut into that pie.
I made it for Mike.

18:58.875 --> 19:01.333
Mike Delfino?

19:01.417 --> 19:03.583
Yes, I left you two messages.
Didn't you check your voice mail?

19:03.667 --> 19:05.750
He woke up from his coma.

19:05.834 --> 19:07.834
Oh, God.

19:13.458 --> 19:15.041
Who is it? Is it Sharla Banning?

19:15.125 --> 19:18.250
I'm not telling who it is.
I'm just asking the question.

19:18.333 --> 19:22.375
If you know a husband has been
unfaithful, do you tell the wife?

19:22.458 --> 19:25.083
Absolutely. If he's cheating,
he could bring home a disease.

19:25.125 --> 19:26.208
Okay, that's what I was thinking.

19:26.291 --> 19:28.000
I mean, that's how Bunny Conners
got chlamydia.

19:28.083 --> 19:30.959
She told me she got it from
wearing someone else's bathing suit.

19:31.041 --> 19:32.625
No, that's how she got crabs.

19:34.208 --> 19:35.750
Poor Bunny. It's always something.

19:35.834 --> 19:38.709
If it's not the clap,
it's a botched face lift.

19:38.792 --> 19:42.542
Be that as it may, do we all agree
that I should tell this man's wife?

19:42.625 --> 19:43.750
I wouldn't.

19:43.834 --> 19:45.792
Women always say they wanna know
if their husband's cheating

19:45.875 --> 19:48.041
and they always resent
the person who tells them.

19:48.125 --> 19:49.750
So if Tom was cheating,
you wouldn't tell me?

19:49.834 --> 19:50.875
No.

19:50.959 --> 19:53.917
But I would hire someone
to beat the crap out of him.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.750
You're sweet.

19:58.125 --> 20:00.834
Bree, I'm sorry, I think you gotta follow
your heart on this one.

20:00.917 --> 20:03.291
Even if it isn't the easiest thing to do.

20:04.959 --> 20:09.834
Gabby, are you and Carlos
getting back together?

20:09.959 --> 20:11.083
Why?

20:16.500 --> 20:18.709
Would you excuse me?

20:21.083 --> 20:24.291
Carlos, what are you doing?
I told you I was having friends over.

20:24.375 --> 20:27.208
I'm thirsty. And this is my kitchen, too.

20:27.291 --> 20:28.750
Hey, ladies.

20:30.166 --> 20:32.667
- For God's sakes, put some pants on.
- Well, I wanted to.

20:32.750 --> 20:35.959
But somebody threw my laundry
out of the dryer while it was still wet.

20:36.041 --> 20:39.375
- Don't act like you didn't deserve that.
- What are you talking about?

20:39.458 --> 20:41.667
- You peed in my shampoo. Admit it.
- What?

20:41.750 --> 20:44.542
Yeah. The cap was loose
and I know how your sick mind works.

20:44.625 --> 20:46.375
Really? Well, in that case,
you should know that

20:46.458 --> 20:49.417
if I was going to do something like that,
I wouldn't do it to your shampoo.

20:49.500 --> 20:53.250
I would do it to your mouthwash,
soup and decaffeinated coffee.

20:56.333 --> 20:57.959
Ladies.

21:05.583 --> 21:09.417
To answer your question,
no, we are not getting back together.

21:22.417 --> 21:26.166
I love this music. What's it about?

21:26.250 --> 21:29.959
Making love. Regret. Cigarettes.

21:30.083 --> 21:32.417
- Cigarettes?
- That's what I assume. It's French.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.792
They write what they know.

21:34.875 --> 21:37.208
I'd love to go to France someday.

21:40.083 --> 21:43.250
- Would you like to go next month?
- Are you serious?

21:43.333 --> 21:44.875
Yeah, I'm going on business.
Come with me.

21:44.959 --> 21:49.333
Ian, I just took a week off. I couldn't
possibly justify taking another.

21:49.417 --> 21:50.875
You'll manage.

21:50.959 --> 21:55.208
We've already proven ourselves
masters of the flimsy rationalisation.

21:55.291 --> 22:00.875
Well, okay. You gotta promise me
we'll actually leave the hotel room.

22:01.041 --> 22:04.875
It's Paris, dear. We can pretty much
make love anywhere.

22:06.667 --> 22:08.750
I thought you said
you didn't get reception up here.

22:08.834 --> 22:10.500
Well, the occasional signal
gets through.

22:10.583 --> 22:13.083
Please don't answer.

22:13.166 --> 22:15.291
It's Julie. I have to.

22:15.375 --> 22:17.250
Hello. What's up?

22:17.333 --> 22:18.834
Hey...

22:18.917 --> 22:20.750
I can't...

22:20.834 --> 22:23.208
No, can you say that again?

22:23.375 --> 22:25.709
The signal's really bad.

22:27.250 --> 22:29.750
What? Oh, my God.

22:29.875 --> 22:32.125
- Is something wrong?
- Mike woke up.

22:32.208 --> 22:34.250
Julie, when did he...

22:34.333 --> 22:36.375
Julie? Julie!

22:36.458 --> 22:39.083
Oh, damn it! Oh, my God.

22:40.291 --> 22:42.291
Oh, my God.

22:43.667 --> 22:47.250
I have to go. I gotta get out of here.

22:47.333 --> 22:49.125
Yes, of course.

22:50.333 --> 22:52.458
I think that you're sitting on my bra.

23:00.291 --> 23:01.375
What'd the coach say?

23:01.458 --> 23:03.625
What do you think he said?
Parker's off the team.

23:03.709 --> 23:06.792
- That's not fair. It's not his fault.
- It doesn't matter.

23:06.875 --> 23:09.917
Because his mother bribed
an eight-year-old pitcher,

23:10.125 --> 23:12.625
who also, by the way,
was kicked off of his team.

23:12.709 --> 23:14.417
Not Nicky, too?

23:15.500 --> 23:16.792
What were you thinking?

23:16.875 --> 23:21.500
I was trying to repair
my son's shattered self-esteem.

23:21.583 --> 23:23.583
- With a 50?
- Yeah.

23:24.250 --> 23:25.834
Honey, everything would
have been fine

23:25.917 --> 23:28.750
if you'd just let Parker quit.

23:28.875 --> 23:32.417
Well, excuse me
for not wanting my son to be a quitter.

23:33.709 --> 23:37.750
Yeah, 'cause I guess having two
in the family would be a bit much.

23:37.834 --> 23:39.458
Where'd that come from?

23:39.542 --> 23:42.583
You say that you support my decision
to leave advertising, follow my dream,

23:42.667 --> 23:44.750
but it is obvious to me
that you resent it.

23:44.834 --> 23:46.333
That is not true.

23:46.417 --> 23:48.041
Why do you keep dropping
all these hints

23:48.125 --> 23:50.041
about the job at Burnham Fox
then, huh?

23:50.125 --> 23:52.291
I just figured,
since you're taking your time

23:52.375 --> 23:54.458
figuring out what your dream even is,

23:54.542 --> 23:56.625
you might wanna make a few bucks
in the meantime.

23:56.709 --> 23:59.166
I have a dream, too.
It includes keeping this house.

23:59.250 --> 24:00.792
Like I don't...

24:03.792 --> 24:05.709
- Are you fighting?
- No.

24:06.583 --> 24:07.667
No.

24:08.792 --> 24:11.250
It was excitement,
because we have just decided

24:11.333 --> 24:13.542
you don't have to play
baseball any more.

24:13.667 --> 24:16.500
- Isn't that great?
- I can't stop now.

24:17.208 --> 24:18.625
Not when I'm finally getting good.

24:18.709 --> 24:21.375
You were right, Mom.
I just need a little more practise.

24:21.458 --> 24:22.917
So, come on, come on,
let's go practise.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
See you outside.

24:27.333 --> 24:31.333
So what's on the next page
of your parenting handbook?

24:33.792 --> 24:36.750
- Ian, can you please hurry?
- I am hurrying.

24:37.583 --> 24:39.417
We should have been on the road
10 minutes ago.

24:39.500 --> 24:41.208
It's not like checking out of a hotel.

24:41.291 --> 24:43.792
There's doors to secure,
I have to turn the gas valve off.

24:43.875 --> 24:45.250
Can't you do that stuff later?

24:45.333 --> 24:46.959
When? After the place is overrun
by raccoons?

24:47.041 --> 24:49.083
Of course, the joke'll be on them
when it blows up.

24:49.166 --> 24:52.208
Mike is awake. He's lying there
and he's wondering where I am.

24:52.291 --> 24:56.125
Yes, I get it. You're in a hurry.
Just please give me a minute.

24:56.208 --> 24:58.750
I bet you'd move faster
if Jane were awake.

25:06.333 --> 25:10.709
Here's the picture that you took of me
in my bikini at that pool party.

25:11.125 --> 25:13.875
You could have warned me
I was showing a little nip.

25:14.792 --> 25:17.625
Susan Mayer. Remember her?

25:17.709 --> 25:21.000
Yeah. She's pretty.

25:21.917 --> 25:25.458
Yeah, she is, sort of, in this picture.
Is there a date on this thing?

25:25.542 --> 25:28.625
The nurses said
that she visited me a lot.

25:28.709 --> 25:32.000
- We were close, huh?
- You have just come out of a coma.

25:32.083 --> 25:35.875
Can we not talk about Susan
till you start to regain your strength?

25:35.959 --> 25:37.083
Why?

25:38.500 --> 25:43.000
Oh, God.
I hate to be the one telling you this.

25:43.083 --> 25:46.542
- Well, if you don't want to...
- That tramp treated you like dirt.

25:46.667 --> 25:49.500
She strung you along,
she slept with other guys.

25:49.583 --> 25:51.583
You broke up with her twice.

25:51.667 --> 25:54.458
Then why did she keep visiting me
when I was out of it?

25:54.542 --> 25:57.208
Well, she's a bit of a stalker.

25:57.291 --> 25:58.959
I was worried
that she was gonna come in here

25:59.041 --> 26:01.667
and disconnect one of the tubes
or something.

26:01.750 --> 26:05.166
But don't worry,
she's glommed onto some new guy,

26:05.250 --> 26:08.625
and she's up in the mountains
at his place with him right now.

26:08.709 --> 26:13.875
Wow. She'd told the nurses
that she really loved me.

26:15.792 --> 26:19.667
That's the one thing about Susan
that you must never forget.

26:20.500 --> 26:22.250
She is a liar.

26:33.583 --> 26:38.709
- You waiting to see Mike Delfino?
- Yes. I'm a neighbour.

26:38.792 --> 26:41.125
But he already has a visitor.
So I'll come back later.

26:41.375 --> 26:43.375
Don't be surprised
if he doesn't recognise you.

26:43.458 --> 26:46.417
He's suffered significant memory loss.

26:47.834 --> 26:49.125
Really?

26:50.875 --> 26:52.625
That's too bad.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.041
Sure you don't wanna go in?

26:55.125 --> 26:56.917
Ms Britt's here all the time.
She won't mind.

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
No, I've waited this long.
I can wait a bit longer.

27:20.500 --> 27:21.875
Gabby?

27:29.917 --> 27:32.917
- Hey, Carlos. What's up?
- My key won't work.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.083
That's probably
because I had the locks changed.

27:39.125 --> 27:40.917
- Gabby.
- Can't be too safe.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.542
You never know
when someone might move in on you

27:42.625 --> 27:45.000
when you're not looking.

27:54.583 --> 27:58.208
Hello, 911? There's an intruder
breaking into my home.

28:01.542 --> 28:04.959
Can you tell them to come armed?
I think he's Mexican.

28:06.542 --> 28:07.875
I'm telling you, I'm her husband.

28:07.959 --> 28:10.583
I bought her this house.
My name is on the deed.

28:10.667 --> 28:12.834
Ma'am, if you're married,
it's a matter of public record.

28:12.917 --> 28:15.125
I can find out very quickly.

28:18.792 --> 28:20.000
All right.

28:20.083 --> 28:21.792
But we're going through
a very messy divorce,

28:21.875 --> 28:23.291
and he moved back in on me.

28:23.375 --> 28:25.083
And everyone knows
the wife keeps the house

28:25.166 --> 28:27.125
and the husband gets
the crappy apartment.

28:27.208 --> 28:29.000
It's the American way.

28:29.083 --> 28:32.125
Call my lawyer. This is all totally legal
and she knows it.

28:32.208 --> 28:34.875
She's just trying to get back at me.

28:35.834 --> 28:37.792
I hear that.

28:37.875 --> 28:41.417
You wouldn't believe
the stuff my wife pulled when we split.

28:44.208 --> 28:46.458
Whoa! You can't take sides.

28:46.542 --> 28:48.875
Police officers aren't allowed
to take sides.

28:48.959 --> 28:51.291
I pay your salary.

28:51.375 --> 28:54.792
Ted, you see that?
This lady just assaulted me.

28:56.500 --> 28:59.417
It was a swat. Ted, does this hurt?

29:03.375 --> 29:07.875
Get your hands off me. Police brutality!

29:17.208 --> 29:20.750
This is all my fault.
Why punish Parker?

29:20.834 --> 29:24.625
Sorry, Mrs Scavo. Rules are rules.
I can't put him back on the team.

29:24.709 --> 29:28.291
Just one more game, he'll suck,
the other kids will taunt him.

29:28.375 --> 29:30.875
He'll wanna quit again.
See, everybody wins.

29:30.959 --> 29:33.125
- Wish I could help, but...
- Please.

29:33.208 --> 29:35.834
You can't bend the rules just once?

29:37.333 --> 29:40.542
Do you know the team could use
some new batting helmets?

29:41.625 --> 29:45.458
- You're asking for a bribe?
- You pretending you're above that?

29:46.709 --> 29:48.792
I'll get my chequebook.

29:50.458 --> 29:52.166
Hello, Vera.

29:52.250 --> 29:55.333
I made you some of those shortbread
biscuits that you like so much.

29:55.417 --> 29:58.583
How sweet. Can you stay for some tea?

29:58.667 --> 30:01.250
It's been so long.
We have some catching up to do.

30:01.333 --> 30:04.000
Yes. Yes, we do.

30:12.333 --> 30:14.333
I know how painful this must be for you.

30:14.417 --> 30:18.250
It isn't easy for me either,
considering Andrew's role in it.

30:19.709 --> 30:23.750
- And why have you told me this?
- Because I thought you'd wanna know.

30:25.291 --> 30:26.333
Why?

30:27.041 --> 30:28.750
So you could do something.

30:33.625 --> 30:35.375
Do you think I'm an idiot?

30:35.458 --> 30:39.208
That I know nothing about the man
I've lived with for 27 years?

30:42.291 --> 30:45.667
I've always assumed
Howard had some outlet.

30:45.750 --> 30:47.417
A friend tucked away somewhere.

30:47.500 --> 30:50.750
I didn't know. I didn't care to know.

30:52.125 --> 30:54.959
But thank you for painting so vivid,

30:55.041 --> 30:58.417
so indelible a picture
of my husband's activities.

30:58.500 --> 31:01.750
I'm sorry.
I just felt that if it were me, I...

31:01.834 --> 31:04.083
- You'd want to know.
- Yes. Absolutely.

31:04.166 --> 31:07.125
Then I owe you an apology.

31:07.208 --> 31:11.000
Because I've been sitting on
a little secret about your family.

31:11.083 --> 31:13.667
- Oh?
- Actually, it's not much of a secret.

31:13.750 --> 31:14.834
My daughter tells me

31:14.917 --> 31:16.875
it's common knowledge
among the cheerleaders.

31:16.959 --> 31:18.125
What is?

31:19.208 --> 31:22.625
The fact that Danielle is sleeping
with her history teacher.

31:25.583 --> 31:28.041
But where are my manners?

31:28.125 --> 31:31.417
I should have brought
some biscuits with that.

31:35.875 --> 31:37.542
Batter up.

31:39.458 --> 31:42.458
Well, aren't we just
the parents of the year?

31:42.542 --> 31:44.291
Sitting in the stands,
rooting for our son to fail

31:44.375 --> 31:46.834
so we can weasel out
of a bribery scandal.

31:46.917 --> 31:51.125
Two bribery scandals.
Gotta count the batting helmets.

31:53.417 --> 31:55.500
Strike one.

31:55.583 --> 31:58.291
You know, for what it's worth,
I don't think you're a quitter.

31:58.375 --> 31:59.709
Good.

32:00.709 --> 32:03.208
- And you don't resent me?
- No.

32:03.291 --> 32:04.333
Ball one.

32:04.417 --> 32:07.083
- Okay, well, maybe a little.
- Why?

32:07.166 --> 32:08.542
You get to chase your dream

32:08.625 --> 32:11.000
while I get to spend the rest of my life
in advertising.

32:11.333 --> 32:12.667
Strike two.

32:12.750 --> 32:16.333
Maybe I'd like to write a book
or, you know, start my own magazine.

32:16.417 --> 32:19.166
And then I think, "No, I can't.
I have a family to support."

32:19.250 --> 32:23.041
And I am okay with that,
most of the time.

32:24.208 --> 32:27.750
You know what? I'm gonna look into
that job at Burnham Fox.

32:27.834 --> 32:29.500
Don't you dare.

32:29.583 --> 32:30.959
You are gonna chase your dream

32:31.041 --> 32:34.417
and I am gonna support you
99% of the time.

32:35.917 --> 32:38.333
That's all I could really ask for.

32:46.166 --> 32:48.291
How the hell did he do that?

32:51.208 --> 32:53.458
Crap, they're cheering for him.

32:55.333 --> 33:00.041
Oh, jeez. He's never gonna quit now.
What are we gonna say to him?

33:13.333 --> 33:17.250
I don't know, buddy.
It looks like a pretty bad sprain.

33:17.333 --> 33:20.458
Probably gonna be out
the rest of the season.

33:21.750 --> 33:23.083
Damn.

33:24.083 --> 33:27.750
Hey, but you know what?
That was one heck of a hit.

33:27.834 --> 33:29.834
It sure was.

33:50.083 --> 33:52.542
Posted your bail. We can go.

33:57.750 --> 33:59.959
- Gabby...
- Don't talk to me.

34:00.000 --> 34:03.250
Lighten up.
You were in there for maybe an hour.

34:03.333 --> 34:06.375
The whole thing is funny
and you know it.

34:08.250 --> 34:11.458
Come on, Gabby. We've been
going at each other for months now.

34:11.542 --> 34:13.583
Can we just stop?

34:13.667 --> 34:16.208
You know as well as I do,
we're gonna end up back together.

34:16.291 --> 34:18.208
Wow. You are crazy.

34:18.291 --> 34:21.125
No, what's crazy is throwing away
the past three years.

34:21.208 --> 34:24.750
I mean, why can't we just say
what we really feel for a change?

34:28.375 --> 34:31.834
Fine. I'll get the ball rolling.
I still love you.

34:31.917 --> 34:33.917
That's too bad,
because I don't love you.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.959
Yeah, right.

34:36.041 --> 34:37.500
I don't.

34:38.417 --> 34:41.333
And I haven't for a very long time.

34:42.375 --> 34:44.583
That's a lie.
You're just saying that to hurt me.

34:44.667 --> 34:48.417
No, if I wanted to hurt you
I would tell you about last weekend,

34:48.500 --> 34:50.458
when I slept with John Rowland.

34:59.792 --> 35:01.959
Carlos, what are you doing?

35:02.834 --> 35:04.333
Carlos!

35:06.500 --> 35:11.208
Carlos! You can't leave me out here
in the middle of nowhere.

35:37.583 --> 35:40.041
Danielle. Danielle,
he is your history teacher

35:40.125 --> 35:42.417
and he is 35 years old.

35:42.500 --> 35:45.542
- Robert says age is just a number.
- Don't you dare leave this house.

35:45.625 --> 35:48.792
You can't break us up.
I love him and he loves me.

35:59.834 --> 36:01.792
Come on, Mom.

36:01.875 --> 36:06.709
I am so tired of feeling like
the worst mother who ever lived.

36:07.375 --> 36:10.166
You're not. There's Grandma.

36:14.625 --> 36:16.875
I've tried so hard
to set a good example.

36:16.959 --> 36:20.417
I've done the best I could
to teach you kids right from wrong.

36:20.500 --> 36:22.333
Why isn't it taking?

36:23.667 --> 36:27.000
It took. I mean, we know the difference
between right and wrong.

36:27.083 --> 36:28.917
We just chose wrong.

36:30.208 --> 36:31.333
Why?

36:31.875 --> 36:34.959
Sometimes when you push a kid
really hard to go one way,

36:35.041 --> 36:38.208
the other way starts to look
more entertaining.

36:38.291 --> 36:40.208
You're awful.

36:40.291 --> 36:42.750
I know. I blame shoddy parenting.

36:48.291 --> 36:53.583
You know, we never discussed what
it was like for you while you were away.

36:54.417 --> 36:57.625
I just want you to know,
if you ever wanna talk about it,

36:57.709 --> 37:00.208
there's nothing you can't tell me.

37:03.792 --> 37:05.041
Thanks.

37:07.583 --> 37:10.166
Not right now, okay?

37:18.667 --> 37:20.834
I'll pick up my bags later.

37:22.417 --> 37:25.542
- It's not my fault you weren't there.
- What?

37:25.625 --> 37:28.208
It's not.
I know what you're feeling, but...

37:28.291 --> 37:30.041
How could you possibly know
what I was feeling?

37:30.125 --> 37:33.375
For six months I have prayed every day
for that man to wake up.

37:33.458 --> 37:35.709
- And you made me give up on him.
- I did not make you.

37:35.834 --> 37:37.792
Okay, not on purpose, but you did.

37:37.875 --> 37:39.625
You were sweet and charming
and English.

37:39.709 --> 37:41.291
And that's why
when my prayers were answered,

37:41.375 --> 37:43.875
I was 100 miles away,
naked in someone else's arms.

37:43.959 --> 37:47.625
- This should never have happened.
- You can say what you want about this.

37:47.709 --> 37:50.375
Say that you feel guilty.
Say that it was bad timing.

37:50.500 --> 37:54.125
But don't you say that
this should never have happened.

37:56.792 --> 38:00.834
Because you're the best thing
that's happened to me in years.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.750
Ian, I'm sorry.

38:07.792 --> 38:09.792
I know how you feel.

38:11.041 --> 38:14.125
It's Mike. It's my Mike.

38:19.542 --> 38:21.750
Then you should go.

38:27.667 --> 38:29.083
Thank you.

38:46.291 --> 38:50.542
Oh, my God. You are awake.

38:50.917 --> 38:54.000
- Hi, Susan.
- Oh, God.

38:54.083 --> 38:57.667
It's so wonderful to hear
your voice again.

38:57.750 --> 39:01.333
- They say you've been here a lot.
- Yes. Yes, I have.

39:01.417 --> 39:03.125
Almost every day.

39:03.500 --> 39:05.291
I can't tell you how much
I'm kicking myself

39:05.375 --> 39:07.834
for not being here when you woke up.

39:07.917 --> 39:09.917
Where were you?

39:11.875 --> 39:13.500
I was in the country.

39:15.333 --> 39:17.208
But I'm back now.

39:18.375 --> 39:19.542
Okay.

39:22.875 --> 39:26.250
Something wrong?
You don't seem happy to see me.

39:30.166 --> 39:32.834
To be honest, I don't remember you.

39:34.750 --> 39:36.125
What?

39:36.208 --> 39:40.208
I remember moving to Fairview
and meeting people.

39:40.291 --> 39:44.583
And after that, nothing.
The doctors say it's the head trauma.

39:48.583 --> 39:51.125
But you're gonna be all right.

39:51.208 --> 39:53.417
I'm gonna help you remember.

39:53.500 --> 39:56.041
If you don't mind, I'm kind of tired now.

39:58.750 --> 40:00.250
Okay.

40:02.333 --> 40:04.000
God...

40:04.083 --> 40:07.333
Right, you sleep.

40:07.417 --> 40:09.667
I'll come back tomorrow.

40:10.542 --> 40:12.417
I'd rather you didn't.

40:16.500 --> 40:18.500
Well, I've got therapy.

40:19.500 --> 40:21.500
Maybe next week.

40:28.041 --> 40:29.709
Okay.

41:08.500 --> 41:11.917
<i>We all have our reasons</i>
<i>for rewriting history.</i>

41:14.083 --> 41:17.166
<i>Sometimes we need</i>
<i>to provide ourselves alibis.</i>

41:17.250 --> 41:19.333
Drama camp was awesome.

41:19.417 --> 41:22.542
We're talking zero supervision.

41:22.625 --> 41:26.041
<i>Sometimes we wanna hurt</i>
<i>someone who has hurt us.</i>

41:26.125 --> 41:29.375
So you can tell Carlos
that he can have the photo albums.

41:29.458 --> 41:33.917
She says that they hold
no sentimental value for her.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.333
<i>And then there are times</i>

41:35.417 --> 41:38.458
<i>we just wanna spare</i>
<i>ourselves embarrassment.</i>

41:38.542 --> 41:40.333
I don't know how these rumours
get started.

41:40.417 --> 41:43.291
No, Parker only quit the team
'cause he hurt his ankle.

41:46.500 --> 41:50.083
<i>Of course, there are some</i>
<i>who feel that to rewrite history</i>

41:50.166 --> 41:52.709
<i>is just another way to lie.</i>

41:52.792 --> 41:56.417
And poor Howard has to work
late again tonight.

41:56.500 --> 41:59.250
Of course, he does it all for the family.

42:01.875 --> 42:04.625
<i>But what is history anyway...</i>

42:04.709 --> 42:09.041
You say I dated Susan for a long time.

42:09.125 --> 42:11.458
Do you think I was in love with her?

42:11.542 --> 42:14.667
<i>...but a set of lies agreed upon?</i>

42:16.417 --> 42:18.083
I don't.

42:18.166 --> 42:21.709
I really, really don't.
