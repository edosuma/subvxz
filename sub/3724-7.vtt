00:01.406 --> 00:04.938
- Graham: Welcome to "Everlasting."
- [Cheers and applause]

00:05.244 --> 00:07.673
- Why'd you come back?
- I wanted to see you.

00:08.863 --> 00:10.435
Maybe we should postpone the wedding.

00:10.435 --> 00:13.002
- This is about Rachel.
- Maybe.

00:13.968 --> 00:16.768
- Mary's a freaking robot.
- I'm surprised she can feel <i>anything</i>

00:16.769 --> 00:19.192
with all the mood stabilizers she's on.

00:23.261 --> 00:27.763
My doctor told me never
to mix this with this,

00:27.765 --> 00:30.783
but I feel amazing.

00:30.785 --> 00:32.772
- Mm.
- Mary: <i>So excited.</i>

00:32.773 --> 00:35.973
<i>I get to see my little girl,
and she gets to meet Adam.</i>

00:35.999 --> 00:36.773
My sister.

00:36.774 --> 00:40.025
Who let Shia talk me
into this family playdate?

00:40.027 --> 00:41.894
She's got an ex-husband, right?

00:41.895 --> 00:44.806
He hit her. He basically, you
know, broke Lily Belle's arms.

00:44.806 --> 00:46.582
We could bring him in.

00:46.584 --> 00:49.362
I mean, it could help Mary get
a little bit of closure, I guess.

00:49.362 --> 00:51.137
- Someone please make him leave.
- Kirk: It's not right, Mary. I just...

00:51.138 --> 00:53.839
- Hold on, mate.
- Shut up! You know what?

00:54.361 --> 00:57.758
Something's wrong. It's Mary.
Somehow, she got on the roof.

00:57.852 --> 00:59.178
Give me your hand right now.

00:59.180 --> 01:00.986
Mary! Wait!

01:08.875 --> 01:11.866
Rachel... Rach.

01:12.952 --> 01:14.819
I had her hand.

01:14.841 --> 01:17.643
- Hey.
- I had her.

01:17.705 --> 01:19.044
It's okay.

01:19.070 --> 01:21.212
It's okay. Hey.

01:21.900 --> 01:23.978
Hey, it's gonna be all right.

01:24.239 --> 01:25.707
Come on.

01:25.937 --> 01:27.404
Let's go.

01:31.757 --> 01:32.928
Jay: Oh, my God. What happened?

01:32.928 --> 01:35.365
It's all right. Get those girls
to a room and make them stay there,

01:35.365 --> 01:37.504
and tell them they cannot
speak to anybody but Chet or me.

01:37.504 --> 01:38.595
- What do we tell them?
- The truth, all right?

01:38.595 --> 01:40.011
You don't know jack. Go.

01:40.396 --> 01:41.895
Shia, did you hear me?

01:41.896 --> 01:43.376
- Um, Mary,
- Shia,

01:43.392 --> 01:45.321
- what...
- get those girls out of here now.

01:47.128 --> 01:49.819
- Where are we going?
- Jay: Faster, faster. Come on, girls.

01:49.819 --> 01:51.498
Is somebody going to
tell us what's going on?

01:51.498 --> 01:53.041
They haven't told us for eight weeks,

01:53.042 --> 01:53.982
- why start now?
- Hey!

01:53.984 --> 01:55.402
- [Sirens wailing in distance]
- Yeah, come on, Shia, just say.

01:55.403 --> 01:58.671
- What's up with the sirens?
- I'm not really sure. Sorry.

01:58.672 --> 02:01.219
- Faith: Come on. You know. You work here.
- Look at her... she's lying.

02:01.219 --> 02:03.552
You know what, ladies? Let's just...
let's just keep it moving, all right?

02:03.552 --> 02:04.909
Adam: What the hell is going on?

02:04.911 --> 02:07.085
Everything's all right. Just
go back to your room, Adam.

02:07.085 --> 02:08.924
- Rachel, are you okay? What happened?
- She's gonna be fine.

02:08.924 --> 02:09.783
Over here!

02:09.785 --> 02:11.362
Madison: Quinn just wants
everyone in their room.

02:11.362 --> 02:12.986
No, not until somebody explains
to me what the hell is...

02:12.986 --> 02:15.503
[Voice breaking] Adam, please stop, okay?

02:15.505 --> 02:16.805
[Wailing sirens continue]

02:18.542 --> 02:19.747
Okay, girls, hurry it up, please.

02:19.748 --> 02:21.999
Everyone in. Come on. Come on.

02:21.999 --> 02:23.402
- Okay.
- Thank you.

02:23.402 --> 02:25.347
Hey, can we get, um, a few...

02:25.578 --> 02:28.856
There's a cop car and
an ambulance out there.

02:29.643 --> 02:32.614
When my dad died, they called
an ambulance for no reason.

02:32.614 --> 02:34.313
It was... It was all for show.

02:34.313 --> 02:36.441
This is obviously a stunt.

02:36.544 --> 02:38.766
Come here. Come here. Are you okay?

02:39.191 --> 02:40.612
Just look at me, all right?

02:40.614 --> 02:42.270
She's dead, isn't she?

02:42.313 --> 02:45.738
Listen, we are so
supremely screwed right now.

02:45.825 --> 02:47.787
I need you to stay strong, okay?

02:47.787 --> 02:49.120
What happened?

02:49.122 --> 02:53.736
Th-The whole thing with
Kirk... this is on us.

02:53.736 --> 02:55.974
- This is our fault.
- Okay, okay.

02:55.974 --> 02:57.930
Come here, come here.

02:58.765 --> 03:01.349
[Sighs, sniffles]

03:01.351 --> 03:03.475
- Anyone seen Mary?
- Uh-uh.

03:03.475 --> 03:05.750
- No.
- Maybe something's wrong with her.

03:05.750 --> 03:08.844
I bet she's just with Adam.
I mean, she just won the date.

03:08.845 --> 03:11.609
They probably want us sitting around
dissing her 'cause we're jealous.

03:11.609 --> 03:14.987
Typical, it's all made up. 100% delusional.

03:14.987 --> 03:18.073
No, I don't know. This...
this seems real to me.

03:18.073 --> 03:20.607
- It always <i>looks</i> real.
- This is different.

03:20.607 --> 03:22.487
There are... there are no cameras there.

03:22.489 --> 03:25.228
- They're... they're not shooting it.
- [Police radio chatter]

03:25.610 --> 03:28.236
You guys, she's right.
There's no cameras out there.

03:28.775 --> 03:30.161
Or in here.

03:34.301 --> 03:36.835
- Oh, okay. Here we go.

Now, remember, it's the
network, so keep it upbeat,

03:39.091 --> 03:40.672
but also, somebody died.

03:40.674 --> 03:42.424
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay.

03:42.426 --> 03:44.131
- [Ringing]
- Oh, God.

03:44.478 --> 03:45.678
What?

03:46.100 --> 03:47.733
Two deaths in one season.

03:47.734 --> 03:49.848
First Anna's dad, and now this.

03:49.850 --> 03:51.599
- So?
- It's out there.

03:51.949 --> 03:53.596
Okay, here we go. Hey, Brad.

03:53.597 --> 03:54.887
Chet: Sorry to get you up.

03:54.888 --> 03:57.355
<i>What the hell's going on? It's 2:00 A.M.</i>

03:57.357 --> 03:59.691
Uh, a little bit of a situation here.

03:59.693 --> 04:05.323
Uh, uh, one of our c-cast
members passed away... Mary.

04:06.268 --> 04:09.463
<i>Oh, well, oh, my God, I'm... I'm so sorry.</i>

04:09.463 --> 04:11.095
<i>She... she was a black girl, right?</i>

04:11.095 --> 04:13.932
No. The mom.

04:20.877 --> 04:22.795
Hey, Rachel, uh, I got to talk to you.

04:22.795 --> 04:24.090
Yeah, what is it, Shia?

04:24.091 --> 04:26.104
Look, it's just Mary...
I don't know what to think.

04:26.104 --> 04:28.740
I know, sweetie, we're all
asking ourselves the same thing.

04:28.740 --> 04:31.523
No, no, I got to talk this
through, and you got to listen.

04:31.525 --> 04:33.141
Rachel Goldberg?

04:33.143 --> 04:34.476
Yes.

04:34.478 --> 04:36.227
I need to get a statement.

04:36.820 --> 04:38.275
All right.

04:40.901 --> 04:43.669
Brad: <i>I'm gonna call Legal.
We'll deal with the family.</i>

04:43.669 --> 04:47.101
<i>You let your people know, but I want to
zip this thing up airtight, all right?</i>

04:47.101 --> 04:48.262
<i>That means no Twitter</i>

04:48.263 --> 04:50.436
<i>- and no Instagram pics.</i>
- Got it.

04:50.436 --> 04:52.413
<i>I'll be up there on the
first flight in the morning,</i>

04:52.413 --> 04:54.548
<i>so you send the crew
home but hold the cast.</i>

04:54.548 --> 04:57.045
<i>And I do not want a single frame shot</i>

04:57.045 --> 04:58.668
<i>until we are back up, understood?</i>

04:58.668 --> 05:02.754
Okay. Brad, about how long
are we talking about here?

05:02.756 --> 05:06.128
<i>A week, a month... no
idea, and I won't know</i>

05:06.128 --> 05:08.560
<i>until we get Legal up there
and see what's happening.</i>

05:08.562 --> 05:10.261
- Uh-huh.
- Right, of... of course,

05:10.263 --> 05:12.111
but we don't want the cast

05:12.112 --> 05:13.775
- to stew on this.
<i>- Forget it, Quinn,</i>

05:13.775 --> 05:14.983

05:14.985 --> 05:17.274
<i>You hear me? All right.</i>

You can't hold me here like a prisoner.

I'm not Edward Snowden.
This is a game show.

05:41.659 --> 05:42.909
You love this, don't you? You

05:42.910 --> 05:45.096
- really love it.
- I got it. Thanks.

05:45.843 --> 05:47.497
What the hell is going on?

05:47.497 --> 05:49.968
- I... I do not like being lied to.
- Nobody's lying to you.

05:49.970 --> 05:51.544
We're just trying to
figure out what happened,

05:51.544 --> 05:54.034
and until we do, we just
need everybody to stay...

05:54.034 --> 05:56.774
- No, don't try to spin me.
- Mary killed herself.

05:57.361 --> 06:00.171
She seem... I mean, she was happy. I...

06:00.247 --> 06:02.254
Even after Kirk came, she seemed fine. I...

06:02.255 --> 06:04.870
I know. We talked, I
thought I had her, but...

06:06.313 --> 06:07.515
You know, I'm okay.

06:07.516 --> 06:09.893
I... I just have to try and stay focused,

06:09.894 --> 06:11.216
- so...
- Yeah.

06:11.217 --> 06:12.949
It would be really great if you could just

06:12.949 --> 06:14.909
talk to the rest of the cast, the girls.

06:15.738 --> 06:17.605
Me? No, no. I don't think that would...

06:17.605 --> 06:20.598
I really think it needs to come from
somebody that they know and trust.

06:20.964 --> 06:24.135
That's insane. I'm not a grief
counselor, for God's sake.

06:24.135 --> 06:26.716
I'm... I'm English.

06:26.716 --> 06:28.855
Look, you've just been there
for them for so many things,

06:28.855 --> 06:31.792
you know, like Anna's dad,
that whole thing with Faith,

06:31.792 --> 06:34.835
and you took a hit for Mary,
literally. That means something.

06:34.836 --> 06:36.342
Yeah, but, I mean, those things weren't...

06:36.342 --> 06:39.858
this is... I mean, she's... she's dead.

06:39.858 --> 06:41.387
I don't know what to do about that,

06:41.387 --> 06:43.216
and I certainly don't know what to say.

06:44.066 --> 06:45.773
Just tell them the truth.

- I know.

- What happened's so bad.
- I... I know.

07:00.707 --> 07:02.206
- This is on me, okay?
- I know that.

07:02.208 --> 07:04.634
- I called Kirk. I got it.
- No, no, no, no.

07:04.634 --> 07:08.046
Mary... Mary was my girl, and I, um...

07:08.253 --> 07:09.462
You what?

07:09.609 --> 07:12.216
Her... her meds. They were
making her like a zombie.

07:12.397 --> 07:13.939
Dude, she wasn't a zombie yesterday.

07:13.939 --> 07:15.803
She was hyper. She was all over the place.

07:15.805 --> 07:18.034
Because... that's 'cause
she went off her meds.

07:18.034 --> 07:20.369
- Shia, did she tell you that?
- I was trying to help her.

07:20.369 --> 07:22.790
She was never gonna win if
she stayed on those things.

07:23.089 --> 07:26.599
Okay, so did you ask her to
get off of her medication?

07:26.599 --> 07:28.024
Is that what you're saying?

07:28.710 --> 07:31.069
I... I swapped out a few of her pills.

07:31.607 --> 07:33.278
You what?

07:34.740 --> 07:37.145
No, look, it was just for a couple of days.

07:37.145 --> 07:39.090
You saw her. She came alive on camera.

07:39.090 --> 07:41.182
I got her off the
sidelines and into the game.

07:41.182 --> 07:43.420
- I delivered a win.
- No, you didn't. You delivered a body.

07:43.420 --> 07:44.920
- I only did what you would've done.
- I would have never

07:44.921 --> 07:45.820
done something like that.

07:45.821 --> 07:48.083
That's the problem with you,
Shia. You always cross the line.

07:48.084 --> 07:50.251
Don't give me that. You and
Quinn don't <i>have</i> a line,

07:50.252 --> 07:51.783
- and you know it.
- Are you kidding me? Of course we do.

07:51.784 --> 07:53.624
We'd never put somebody's life at risk.

07:53.624 --> 07:54.989
You called Kirk.

07:54.990 --> 07:58.930
- You even said it was your call.
- Kirk didn't kill her, you did.

08:00.577 --> 08:02.929
- I got to get out of here.
- No.

08:02.930 --> 08:04.786
No, this place is on lockdown,

08:04.786 --> 08:06.104
and I am not gonna lie for you.

08:06.106 --> 08:08.439
You don't have to lie,
just don't say anything.

08:08.441 --> 08:11.042
You need to call Quinn.
You need to tell the police.

08:11.044 --> 08:12.430
The whole show could go down.

08:12.431 --> 08:15.360
- We could all go to jail.
- We really don't have a choice, Shia.

08:16.658 --> 08:17.988
My God.

08:18.120 --> 08:20.034
Look, what's gonna happen to us?

08:41.950 --> 08:43.150
Not now.

08:43.150 --> 08:45.055
Mm, I wouldn't wait.

Hey sorry, I know this has
been a really long night.

09:02.721 --> 09:08.111
Um, and, uh, I don't really
know how to say this...

09:09.676 --> 09:14.612
Uh, one of our own, Mary...
she took her own life.

09:14.612 --> 09:16.857
- [Woman gasps]
- Oh, no.

09:16.857 --> 09:19.134
So, I can imagine we're all
in a lot of shock right now,

09:19.134 --> 09:24.004
and, uh, this is just a very, very sad day.

09:28.622 --> 09:30.914
Uh, thank you. Thank you, Adam.

09:30.916 --> 09:33.911
You are very kind.

09:33.911 --> 09:37.525
Uh, we are going to stop shooting

for a little while, ladies.

Uh, Dr. Wagerstein is
available if you need her.

09:45.462 --> 09:50.233
We're a family, and we are going
to get through this together.

09:50.653 --> 09:52.436
[Indistinct conversations]

09:52.632 --> 09:54.716
I just feel so terrible.

09:55.004 --> 09:57.997
I thought that she was
being selfish yesterday,

09:57.997 --> 10:00.322
but... you know,
something was really wrong,

10:00.322 --> 10:02.195
and I didn't... I didn't realize.

10:02.197 --> 10:06.435
- I can't believe it. I can't. Why?
- Who knows?

10:06.436 --> 10:09.439
Sometimes, you just never know
what's going on with people.

10:10.144 --> 10:11.855
You didn't even like her.

10:12.285 --> 10:14.621
You don't even seem torn up about it.

10:14.636 --> 10:16.051

10:21.270 --> 10:23.133
that there's less competition?

10:23.135 --> 10:26.768
Maya, I've seen more death in my
life than I care to think about.

10:27.002 --> 10:30.390
I've learned to deal with
it in my own way, okay?

10:30.980 --> 10:36.341
Hey, everyone, where I'm from,
we always pray on a hard time.

10:36.643 --> 10:39.351
And I thought that some of y'all
would like to join me in a prayer.

10:39.351 --> 10:40.993
Grab hands, okay?

10:43.097 --> 10:47.630
Dear Lord, today we lost a beautiful soul

10:48.433 --> 10:50.627

10:51.002 --> 10:53.912
Please accept her into your glory

10:53.912 --> 10:55.318

Quinn: Rachel, get in here. I need you now.

11:00.005 --> 11:02.445

No, um, no...

11:15.352 --> 11:17.938
no lawyers, all right?

11:17.939 --> 11:20.926
You are in no condition to go home.

You remember Sandy, our general

Hi.

12:00.852 --> 12:02.457
Rachel: We have to call
the police, I mean, I know

12:02.458 --> 12:04.744
that Shia's gonna get in trouble.
We're all gonna get in trouble,

12:04.744 --> 12:07.405
- but this is crazy serious.
- Mary took her own life...

12:07.567 --> 12:09.262
end of story.

12:11.342 --> 12:13.434
No, no. Quinn, we have to

12:13.435 --> 12:15.991
- take responsibility. Yes, we do have to.
- No, we don't <i>have to</i> do anything.

12:15.992 --> 12:18.043
- Shia switched out her meds, now Mary...
- Mary killed herself.

12:18.044 --> 12:19.643
- It is our responsibility.
- Okay,

12:19.644 --> 12:21.542
you want to turn this into a homicide?

12:21.705 --> 12:23.719
This show has zero chance of coming back.

12:23.719 --> 12:25.962
- It dies along with Mary.
- Who... who gives a shit about a TV show?

12:25.962 --> 12:28.686
- We're talking about somebody's life here.
- Well, I am talking about

12:28.687 --> 12:33.601
more than one life... 170 people will
lose their jobs if this show goes down.

12:33.601 --> 12:36.593
Eddie and Frank will have to
pull their kids out of college.

12:36.593 --> 12:39.837
And why? Because we made Mary jump?

12:40.018 --> 12:43.806
No. What about the millions of
other people who take those pills?

12:43.806 --> 12:45.604
Nobody skips a couple of days

12:45.604 --> 12:46.887
- and they don't live.
- Quinn, that's not

12:46.887 --> 12:49.229
- the same thing. It's totally different.
- Listen, come on, all right. Listen to me,

12:49.229 --> 12:54.397
the truth is we are never going
to know why she took her life...

12:54.397 --> 12:57.563
- the pills, Kirk, the voices in her head.
- I don't even think that

12:57.563 --> 12:59.355
- it's for us to decide something...
- You just wanna

12:59.355 --> 13:01.781
clear your conscience to
make yourself feel better,

13:01.781 --> 13:04.562
but that comes at a very high price.

So before you go all
Jiminy Cricket on everyone,

13:10.186 --> 13:13.129
Hi, um, sorry. The
network lawyers are here,

13:13.129 --> 13:14.329
and they want to see you.

13:15.072 --> 13:16.566
I'll be right there.

13:17.467 --> 13:19.674
Actually, they want to see both of you.

13:21.451 --> 13:24.228
Ms. Goldberg, you contacted Mr. Newhouse

13:24.228 --> 13:27.230
and invited him to visit
his ex-wife on the show.

13:27.230 --> 13:29.349
- Yes.
- And at that time, were you aware

13:29.349 --> 13:31.989
that Mr. Newhouse had a history
of violence toward his family?

13:31.990 --> 13:35.055
Well, we had, um, security on set,

13:35.055 --> 13:38.185
and... and we had crew
members there to protect Mary.

13:38.185 --> 13:39.731
But you were aware?

13:39.731 --> 13:41.297
Yeah, I was.

13:41.299 --> 13:43.478
Is that why you brought him on
the show, so he'd start a fight?

No... I wanted him and his
wife to start speaking again.

20:53.047 --> 20:55.413
So Mary dies and Kirk gets rich?

20:55.414 --> 20:57.548
- Yeah, pretty much.
- [Scoffs]

20:57.733 --> 21:00.338
- And you're just gonna roll with that?
- I mean, what do you want me to do?

21:00.338 --> 21:03.888
The show's, like, shut down. I...
I barely have a job right now.

21:03.889 --> 21:08.086
Rach, come on. You're
like a force of nature.

21:08.087 --> 21:10.728
If anybody can deliver Kirk's
head on a stick, it's you.

21:11.810 --> 21:13.276
Listen, if Kirk's coming after us,

21:13.277 --> 21:15.875
why not expose him for the
abusive dick he really is?

21:15.876 --> 21:18.929
He's a dick, yes, but we have
to do what's best for the show.

21:19.266 --> 21:22.135
Paying off a wife-beater? I don't know
how that's worse than keeping quiet

21:22.136 --> 21:23.648
- about it...
- Hey, Rachel.

21:25.225 --> 21:26.967
Let me just get some footage.

21:27.239 --> 21:30.408
Okay, I can leak it to
Jezebel, Media Girl, Bitch Mag,

21:30.408 --> 21:33.467
and once it goes viral, there's no
way that the network can pay him off.

21:34.544 --> 21:36.769
If we're not gonna tell
the truth about Mary,

21:36.770 --> 21:38.948
let's at least do one good thing here.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.035
What do we need?

21:43.036 --> 21:46.218
Kirk? I mean, Mary didn't
talk about him much.

21:46.219 --> 21:49.405
When she did, she always
seemed pretty scared.

21:50.455 --> 21:52.037
I guess now we know why.

21:52.038 --> 21:54.861
She said that he hit her
before they even got married.

21:55.048 --> 21:58.015
She thought that she was gonna
change him, but she couldn't.

21:58.016 --> 22:00.696
[Voice breaking] They were
together for six years.

22:01.961 --> 22:04.523
Can you imagine living with that?

22:04.524 --> 22:06.686
She said she tried to leave him many times,

22:06.686 --> 22:09.171
even before he hurt the little girl.

22:09.470 --> 22:12.423
But he said he'd find her and kill her.

22:12.424 --> 22:14.449
Well, I mean, she... she never
really talked about Kirk with me.

22:14.450 --> 22:15.774
It's not the sort of thing

22:15.775 --> 22:18.011
- you bring up on a date.
- Right, totally. So, ah,

22:18.011 --> 22:19.882
do you think that Kirk coming here...

22:20.546 --> 22:23.603
I mean, that was the reason
that Mary chose to end things?

22:25.799 --> 22:28.418
You mean when you brought Kirk
here and ambushed him with his...

22:28.419 --> 22:30.005
- with his wife and daughter?
- Okay, you know, that...

22:30.006 --> 22:32.800
- this is not about me.
- Well, maybe it should be.

22:32.801 --> 22:36.103
What, you want me to sit here and talk
about what a horrible man Kirk was,

22:36.104 --> 22:39.112
how he is the reason she jumped to
her death, not you and not the show?

22:39.112 --> 22:40.614
Th-That's what you want me to say?

22:41.861 --> 22:43.890
Yeah, I thought so.

22:48.634 --> 22:50.293
- Screw him.
- [Door closes]

22:50.293 --> 22:51.851
That guy's a prick.

22:53.732 --> 22:56.080
Hey, look, I'm gonna really
need you to go on camera.

22:56.081 --> 22:57.494
I just think it's the least that we can

22:57.495 --> 22:59.292
- do for Mary.
- Oh, please, I know what you're doing.

22:59.292 --> 23:02.680
I just feel like Kirk should
definitely be in jail right now.

23:02.680 --> 23:04.195
Yeah, but <i>you</i> brought him here.

23:04.564 --> 23:05.847
How is that not your fault?

23:05.848 --> 23:08.690
It's so much more complicated
than that. Mary was...

23:08.691 --> 23:10.446
- she was unstable, Adam.
- You don't say.

23:10.446 --> 23:11.904
She jumped off a bloody roof.

23:11.905 --> 23:13.321
That wasn't my fault.

23:13.548 --> 23:15.556
You thought that she could
handle Kirk, and she...

23:15.557 --> 23:18.452
Yes, she could have. It's complicated,
Adam. I can't tell you everything.

23:18.478 --> 23:20.214
- Why not?
- Because you are a contestant.

23:20.214 --> 23:21.121
Oh, so now you suddenly

23:21.122 --> 23:21.977
- care about the rules. No,
- Adam.

23:21.977 --> 23:23.650
would you just... just face it?

23:24.571 --> 23:26.228
You're a monster.

23:27.874 --> 23:29.387
[Door opens]

23:37.194 --> 23:39.072
[Lighter clicking]

23:42.347 --> 23:44.135
- [Whimpers]
- You believe this?

23:44.216 --> 23:47.692
- Hey, hey. Got a light?
- Yeah.

23:50.584 --> 23:51.784
You can keep it.

23:51.785 --> 23:53.205
I've got like 10 of them.

23:53.206 --> 23:55.373
I'm the official candle lighter.

23:56.061 --> 23:57.261
Oh.

23:59.146 --> 24:00.771
No, thanks, no.

24:00.772 --> 24:02.889
Ah, it makes me really paranoid. [Chuckles]

24:02.890 --> 24:04.313
Pretty weird, huh?

24:05.060 --> 24:08.395
No lights, no camera, no action.

24:09.978 --> 24:12.542
The whole season's been kind of freaky.

24:12.543 --> 24:13.758
It's my first one.

24:13.983 --> 24:16.497
I'm assuming it's not always like this.

24:18.550 --> 24:21.415
I think the party's over
and the bill's comin'.

24:21.416 --> 24:22.632
What bill?

24:22.669 --> 24:25.235
I've been selling this shit for years.

24:26.165 --> 24:28.675
I haven't exactly been Prince Charming.

24:29.884 --> 24:32.576
My mom always says that something bad

24:32.576 --> 24:35.917
can't really be that bad if
something good comes of it.

24:36.606 --> 24:39.419
Maybe something positive
will come out of this.

24:44.662 --> 24:46.495
How long am I stuck here?

24:47.072 --> 24:49.072
Just till things settle down.

24:49.582 --> 24:52.813
You mean till Quinn sees if the
cops are gonna press charges.

24:53.168 --> 24:55.125
I mean, you <i>were</i> kind of freaking out.

24:55.125 --> 24:57.474
Maybe she just doesn't want you
saying something you'll regret.

24:57.474 --> 25:00.680
Please. If the cops
come after her and Chet,

25:00.680 --> 25:02.746
she would offer my head up on a platter.

25:02.747 --> 25:04.962
No...[Sighs]

25:04.963 --> 25:07.444
I mean, yeah, Quinn's a
surly, old bitch, to be sure,

25:07.444 --> 25:09.423
but she protects her own.

25:09.424 --> 25:11.291
It's not my fault, Jay.

25:12.368 --> 25:15.096
If Kirk hadn't come, none
of this would have happened.

25:15.465 --> 25:19.355
- All I did was switch...
- No, don't say it. Okay?

25:19.390 --> 25:21.001
Look, it's nothing personal, but I just...

25:21.002 --> 25:22.891
- I don't want...
- Deniability?

25:25.035 --> 25:26.922
I get it.

25:28.493 --> 25:30.827
<i>Women stay in abusive relationships</i>

25:30.828 --> 25:33.182

<i>Mary tried, but, I don't
know, I guess in the end,</i>

25:38.191 --> 25:40.936
<i>she just felt like Kirk was
never real gonna let her go.</i>

25:40.936 --> 25:43.241
- Okay, that's good.
- Yeah, h-hold on her looking down.

25:43.475 --> 25:45.874
It's perfect. All right, upload
it and get it to <i>Jezebel.</i>

25:45.874 --> 25:47.459
I want it out by tonight.

25:47.460 --> 25:48.660
Okay.

25:48.661 --> 25:51.405
I just got the toxicology
report on your dead girl.

25:51.645 --> 25:54.813
And she was drunk and
completely off her meds.

25:54.990 --> 25:56.977
People go off their meds all the time.

25:56.978 --> 25:59.995
But with a full-time
shrink and four producers,

25:59.995 --> 26:01.550
and, what, no one knew?

26:03.058 --> 26:04.260
- What the hell is this?
- Uh,

26:04.260 --> 26:06.602
we were just watching
some old footage, you know,

26:06.603 --> 26:08.302
trying to figure out how to deal with Mary.

26:08.303 --> 26:10.020
- [Chuckles]
- No, no, no, no.

26:10.021 --> 26:12.346
I haven't seen this in
dailies. This is new.

26:12.347 --> 26:14.981
- I told you to shut down.
- Brad, we have a plan,

26:14.982 --> 26:16.863
and this could be a way
to leverage Kirk down.

26:16.864 --> 26:19.523
It's not your call. It's
<i>my</i> call and the lawyers'.

26:19.524 --> 26:21.030
I'm just trying to save my show.

26:21.030 --> 26:23.784
- It's not your show to save.
- I'm an owner, Brad.

26:23.784 --> 26:26.852
You shacked up with the right guy,
and you got paid off in points.

26:26.853 --> 26:28.633
This is my show. I make it.

26:28.634 --> 26:31.670
You're the captain, so we have you to
thank for our own personal <i>Titanic.</i>

- [Door opens]
- Chet always said that you were

26:33.497 --> 26:35.640
great at your job, but maybe he was just

26:35.641 --> 26:37.793
- talking with...
- Whoa, whoa, Brad, Brad. How you doing?

26:37.793 --> 26:39.970
Your producer here... she
crossed the line, all right?

26:39.970 --> 26:41.320
She went behind my back.

26:41.321 --> 26:43.135
You know what? We've all
been through a lot today.

26:43.135 --> 26:45.332
Why don't you and I just have a talk, huh?

26:45.333 --> 26:47.336
You and me. Come on.

26:49.916 --> 26:53.451
[Door opens, closes]

26:56.769 --> 26:58.730
Hey, uh, listen, Brad's...

26:58.731 --> 27:00.031
Just go away.

27:00.032 --> 27:02.683
All right, well, I'm just gonna
send the footage to Jezebel anyway.

27:02.684 --> 27:05.791
You can't. The lawyers
are gonna take the drives.

27:05.991 --> 27:10.573
So... might as well enjoy the sunset.

27:10.574 --> 27:12.306
Quinn, are you seriously just
gonna fall into your drink

27:12.306 --> 27:14.205
because some suit had
a tantrum? That's crazy.

27:14.205 --> 27:17.143
I mean listen, Kirk... he's... he's gonna
get away with like hundreds of thousands

27:17.144 --> 27:20.204
- of dollars here.
- Oh, Rachel, forget it.

27:20.204 --> 27:22.338
No, I mean that dickhead's
not gonna get rich off our show

27:22.338 --> 27:24.086
and throw you into the gutter.
Quinn, you have to fight.

27:24.086 --> 27:26.318
- This is crazy.
- They're already onto the meds,

27:26.318 --> 27:31.374
and as soon as they figure out Shia's
little secret, I am dead and buried.

27:31.374 --> 27:33.478
What, you really think that
Chet's gonna let that happen?

27:33.479 --> 27:36.727
Please. It is time to polish off plan B...

tai, John le Carré novel...

who barely speaks English.

27:45.967 --> 27:47.167
What's yours?

27:47.168 --> 27:49.828
You kind of took away
all my plan B's, remember?

27:50.116 --> 27:51.843
Indefinite forced servitude?

27:51.844 --> 27:55.178
Well, then, you better come up with one.

[Door opens]

28:33.463 --> 28:37.298
[Rachel sighs]

28:40.913 --> 28:44.004
I mean, is that how it works here?
You got the inmates running the asylum?

28:44.005 --> 28:45.421
Quinn's not an inmate.

28:45.422 --> 28:47.172
Okay, she gave you a hit show

28:47.173 --> 28:49.156
and a corner office next to Gary.

28:49.175 --> 28:50.575
Yeah, she also gave me

28:50.576 --> 28:52.872
a potential wrongful-death lawsuit.

28:52.873 --> 28:54.229
Why don't you just give Quinn a chance?

28:54.230 --> 28:56.516
- She's only the best at what she does.
- It doesn't matter because

28:56.517 --> 28:57.832
you have got nothing

28:57.833 --> 29:00.336
- that is gonna save this show.
- Oh, come on, Brad.

29:00.337 --> 29:02.437
It's not just <i>her</i>
job on the line, all right?

29:02.438 --> 29:05.228
You will be named in any lawsuit
against this show, as well,

29:05.229 --> 29:06.931
so if I were you, I'd lawyer up, bub.

29:06.932 --> 29:08.682
Because the shit's hit the fan.

29:08.683 --> 29:12.048
Uh, Chet, I found something.

30:02.047 --> 30:03.250
You're right.

30:04.401 --> 30:06.853
We really need to read this on camera.

30:06.854 --> 30:09.278
I mean, if it's something that
you would be comfortable with,

30:09.278 --> 30:12.656
it would certainly help paint
the show in a better light,

30:12.657 --> 30:15.294
and it would be so good for Mary, too.

30:15.295 --> 30:16.877
It's not just about Mary.

30:17.865 --> 30:22.084
Kirk's power-bitch
lawyer is already angling

30:22.085 --> 30:23.844
to get Lily Belle away from me.

I'll be damned if I let that happen.

Yeah, okay, well, you know, I
can, uh, get the letter to Graham,

30:29.408 --> 30:31.573
make sure that he reads
it on camera tonight.

30:32.052 --> 30:34.986
No. I want to read it.

This week, the "Everlasting" family

31:07.770 --> 31:11.912
tragically lost one of
its own... Mary Newhouse.

Her sad decision to end her
life has left all of us here

that Mary had left in her
room... her child's Teddy bear.

31:29.845 --> 31:33.283

left specifically for her daughter.

us, her sister, Louise.

32:03.554 --> 32:07.139
Getting to know Adam over
the last couple of weeks

32:07.140 --> 32:11.237
has given me so much hope and happiness."

32:13.005 --> 32:16.873
"For the first time in
years, I felt confident enough

32:16.873 --> 32:19.945
to stop counting on
medication to keep me afloat

32:19.946 --> 32:22.863
and dull the pain of everyday life."

32:25.549 --> 32:32.521
"Our day on "Everlasting" was
magical, a dream come true.

32:34.074 --> 32:37.047
But I never should have
invited your father."

32:38.752 --> 32:41.336
"I hoped you could have
seen him someplace safe,

32:41.337 --> 32:42.803
see that he loves you.

32:43.150 --> 32:46.669
Baby, now I know for sure
that as long as I'm alive,

32:47.001 --> 32:51.290
your daddy will try and
hurt me and anyone I love."

32:54.315 --> 32:57.536
[Voice breaking] "That's why
I need to go away, baby girl.

32:58.809 --> 33:02.532
I'm safe now, and you are free.

33:03.453 --> 33:06.488
Goodbye, my little bunny.

33:07.374 --> 33:09.347
Mama loves you."

33:09.348 --> 33:10.916
Let's go to the shot of Mary.

33:11.962 --> 33:13.428
Woman: Cut away.

33:13.430 --> 33:15.213
- Queue it up.
- Hold.

33:19.003 --> 33:20.393
And cut.

33:20.394 --> 33:21.977
- [Bell rings]
- Man: That's a wrap, everybody.

33:21.978 --> 33:25.196
- [Sobbing]
- That was amazing.

33:25.784 --> 33:29.277
Amazing job with Mary's words.
You really did a great job.

33:29.354 --> 33:30.812
- Thanks.
- Mm.

33:31.266 --> 33:32.814
Nice job on the note.

33:32.816 --> 33:35.533
I almost believed it was real.

33:38.139 --> 33:41.888
- Louise, I don't even know what to...
- Don't. It was smart.

33:41.888 --> 33:43.253
It had to be done.

33:43.254 --> 33:44.711
You okay with this?

33:45.579 --> 33:48.246
[Sniffles] Absolutely.

33:48.716 --> 33:52.438
Whatever it takes to keep Lily
Belle away from that monster.

34:10.882 --> 34:14.050
What did Quinn say when she
told you to bring me back here?

34:14.052 --> 34:15.746
Look, I just want to know
what I'm walking into.

34:15.746 --> 34:18.107
Just that she wanted to see you.

34:18.324 --> 34:20.040
Okay, just trust her on this.

34:20.040 --> 34:21.670
Yeah, I'm not trusting anyone right now.

34:21.670 --> 34:23.808
[Chuckles] Look, I know
you're probably thinking

34:23.808 --> 34:25.504
that I'm just like some super crappy friend

34:25.504 --> 34:27.751
for not letting you tell me
about your whole situation,

34:27.752 --> 34:29.554
- but I...
- Yeah, that's exactly what I think,

34:29.554 --> 34:32.091
- and you know I'm right.
- No, you're not.

34:32.092 --> 34:35.679
You wanted to tell me a
secret, and secrets, Shia,

34:35.681 --> 34:39.149
like <i>real</i> secrets,
do not make people closer.

34:40.299 --> 34:44.878
But you and I... we're still good.

34:46.766 --> 34:48.415
Come on.

34:48.879 --> 34:53.371
Fantastic job... just chills,
just so emotional, you know.

34:53.371 --> 34:55.033
It... it's gonna be an incredible episode.

34:55.033 --> 34:58.232
- Hey, we'll dedicate it to Mary.
- Perfect.

34:58.232 --> 35:00.841
By the way, the lawyers
say that that letter...

35:00.842 --> 35:02.266
it's really gonna help us.

35:02.267 --> 35:04.420
So, you know, you delivered, my friend.

35:04.421 --> 35:06.851
- Team effort, my brother. Thank you.
- [Chuckles]

35:08.574 --> 35:11.574
Look, Quinn, I know
that we said some things,

35:11.576 --> 35:14.063
but when you throw down
hard, you bounce back high.

35:14.064 --> 35:16.281
And we're gonna be on top again soon.

35:16.282 --> 35:18.659
Well, it's all about the show. I know.

35:18.660 --> 35:19.930
So, we'll talk tomorrow.

35:19.930 --> 35:21.348
- All right.
- Have a safe flight.

35:21.349 --> 35:23.005
- Thank you.
- Okay.

35:25.577 --> 35:28.277
That bitch goes up against
me again, she's fired.

35:28.278 --> 35:29.971
- Won't happen. I wouldn't worry about it.
- [Engine turns over]

35:29.972 --> 35:33.350
- Okay.
- Bye. Safe flight.

35:33.350 --> 35:35.298
- Thanks.
- [Car door opens, closes]

35:35.941 --> 35:37.141
Bye.

35:38.462 --> 35:41.254
Home slice, where the hell you guys been?

35:41.255 --> 35:43.244
Go ahead, okay? I'll catch up, all right.

35:45.089 --> 35:47.362
Quinn wanted me to keep an eye on her.

35:48.030 --> 35:50.459
But, hey, I heard we're back on the air.

35:50.459 --> 35:52.585
I have got primo

35:52.586 --> 35:54.750
- effing hash, let's celebrate.
- No, no, I can't. I can't.

35:54.750 --> 35:57.400
I got to make a... phone call.

35:58.498 --> 36:00.502
[Sighs]

36:06.011 --> 36:07.331
You should go get some sleep.

36:07.331 --> 36:09.165
- Mm?
- You look like crap.

36:09.521 --> 36:13.429
Nothing a couple shots of
tequila can't fix... or bottles.

36:13.430 --> 36:17.367
Ah, look who's back. Did
you get some rest, sunshine?

36:17.368 --> 36:18.807
Well what was that about?

36:18.807 --> 36:20.484
You literally held me prisoner.

36:20.485 --> 36:24.097
You suck at poker, Shia,
so I didn't want to put you

36:24.099 --> 36:26.221
in the position of having to bluff.

36:26.485 --> 36:29.565
Listen, the police... they
ruled Mary's death a suicide,

36:29.566 --> 36:32.322
so there's not gonna be any more questions.

36:32.323 --> 36:33.548
Shia: Really?

36:33.549 --> 36:36.581
Is that all you care
about? Getting away with it?

36:36.582 --> 36:38.341
Don't either of you feel guilty?

36:38.342 --> 36:40.994
- Those girls know what they signed on for.
- No, they don't.

36:41.528 --> 36:43.720
They have no idea... the crap we pull.

36:43.721 --> 36:47.890
Please, it is no worse than what
happens to them in real life.

36:47.891 --> 36:53.106
Maybe you should go see a priest
or a shrink... guru, perhaps.

36:53.107 --> 36:54.307
What do you do?

36:54.308 --> 36:57.712
- I work.
- Okay, then... then put me back to work.

36:58.216 --> 37:00.051
You don't have any girls left.

37:00.052 --> 37:01.852
- But Maya...
- Quit.

37:01.853 --> 37:04.008
So just go home.

37:05.690 --> 37:07.140
And be grateful that

37:07.142 --> 37:09.660
that's where you're going instead of jail.

37:12.854 --> 37:14.070
[Door closes]

37:14.071 --> 37:16.016
All right, well, I'm out.

37:16.017 --> 37:19.278
- [Sighs]
- Uh, look, I know that this

37:19.279 --> 37:23.434
has been a lot, so if
you ever need to talk...

37:26.104 --> 37:27.635
Thanks.

37:28.258 --> 37:30.118
You know we're never
talking about this again.
