WEBVTT

00:01.734 --> 00:04.572
JAMIE: Ten years ago,
the animal population mutated,

00:04.605 --> 00:07.608
endangering human
life on the planet.

00:07.641 --> 00:09.277
Our team managed to
cure the animals,

00:09.310 --> 00:12.213
but at a terrible cost.

00:12.246 --> 00:15.049
In an attempt to return
the planet to the animals,

00:15.083 --> 00:17.351
a secretive group
called The Shepherds

00:17.385 --> 00:21.155
released a gas that
sterilized all of humanity.

00:21.189 --> 00:23.324
And then, lab-made creatures...
Called hybrids...

00:23.357 --> 00:26.460
Devastated the West Coast.

00:26.494 --> 00:28.296
So a massive barrier
was constructed

00:28.329 --> 00:30.098
to protect the rest
of North America...

00:30.131 --> 00:31.332
(roaring)

00:31.365 --> 00:32.842
but new breeds have
started to appear,

00:32.866 --> 00:36.104
so we're trying to
reassemble our team.

00:36.137 --> 00:37.605
We battle on many fronts,

00:37.638 --> 00:39.707
searching for a
cure to sterility

00:39.740 --> 00:42.110
while racing to
stop the hybrids.

00:42.143 --> 00:45.413
The fight for mankind's
survival has just begun.

00:46.514 --> 00:48.749
Previously on Zoo...
It's me, Clem.

00:48.782 --> 00:50.784
My father's alive,
and he needs you, Jamie.

00:50.818 --> 00:52.653
It's Mitch Morgan.

00:54.788 --> 00:56.357
MYERS: You're gonna be okay.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.592
There's somebody here who's
been waiting to talk to you.

00:58.626 --> 01:01.862
It's me, your daughter.
Clementine.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.873
You have to stop.
The last Shepherd that you chased

01:03.897 --> 01:06.434
ended up dead.
What are you gonna do, arrest me?

01:06.467 --> 01:08.336
I need to know what's on that
drive, ASAP.

01:08.369 --> 01:10.314
Somebody went through a
lot of trouble to get that.

01:10.338 --> 01:11.439
(explosion)

01:11.472 --> 01:13.141
(rhino roaring)

01:13.174 --> 01:14.175
I'm sorry.

01:14.208 --> 01:15.609
(snorts)

01:15.643 --> 01:16.877
Is that the IADG investigator?

01:16.910 --> 01:18.679
Hey, excuse me, miss?

01:24.785 --> 01:26.587
(people screaming)

01:43.571 --> 01:45.573
♪

01:59.187 --> 02:01.189
(thunder rumbles)

02:10.798 --> 02:12.566
Damn it.

02:29.583 --> 02:33.721
96 people dead, 100 wounded.

02:33.754 --> 02:35.456
How could I let this happen?

02:35.489 --> 02:38.292
You didn't.
This was not your fault.

02:38.326 --> 02:42.296
That woman, the bomber,
we have to find her.

02:42.330 --> 02:44.198
We've alerted the
other safe zones.

02:44.232 --> 02:48.736
Yeah, well, what if it's
not about the safe zones?

02:48.769 --> 02:51.405
She bombed us the same day
that we found the new hybrid.

02:51.439 --> 02:52.873
That can't be a coincidence.

02:52.906 --> 02:54.975
What are you saying,
she targeted the hybrid?

02:55.008 --> 02:58.712
I don't know exactly,
but there was this look in her eye.

02:58.746 --> 03:00.180
We have to find her.

03:02.516 --> 03:03.951
I'll grab some extra ammo.

03:03.984 --> 03:05.662
For all we know,
she's over the mountains by now.

03:05.686 --> 03:08.256
Who knows who or
what we'll run into?

03:15.696 --> 03:18.666
FIREFIGHTER: There's
more in the bullpen.

03:22.703 --> 03:23.847
I need some help here. You hurt?

03:23.871 --> 03:26.574
No, I'm fine.

03:26.607 --> 03:27.975
(police radio crackles)

03:35.549 --> 03:37.285
Danica.

03:37.318 --> 03:39.687
You shouldn't be in here.
I know.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.390
So who's working on I.D.'ing
the ignition device?

03:42.423 --> 03:43.791
Who isn't?

03:43.824 --> 03:45.259
We know that it was a hard drive

03:45.293 --> 03:46.527
inside the evidence room.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.704
We're still running analytics,

03:47.728 --> 03:49.430
trying to identify this symbol.

03:51.999 --> 03:53.967
(sighs)

03:56.604 --> 03:57.838
Don't waste your time.

03:59.707 --> 04:02.776
I know where the
hard drive came from.

04:06.847 --> 04:11.419
(phone ringing)

04:11.452 --> 04:12.920
That's where my
dad's supposed to be.

04:12.953 --> 04:13.854
(computer trilling)

04:13.887 --> 04:15.022
Siberia.

04:16.957 --> 04:18.625
After ten years of
coming up empty,

04:18.659 --> 04:20.928
I've learned not
to get my hopes up.

04:20.961 --> 04:22.672
After so long,
I'd almost given up on finding you,

04:22.696 --> 04:24.698
but here you are.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.436
Are you feeling any better?

04:30.338 --> 04:31.472
Oh, it's okay.

04:31.505 --> 04:33.474
Dad, you don't have to talk.

04:33.507 --> 04:35.485
Lieutenant Myers said that
it might take some time.

04:35.509 --> 04:36.577
Where am I?

04:36.610 --> 04:38.612
(computer trilling)

04:38.646 --> 04:39.756
Are you sure these
coordinates are right?

04:39.780 --> 04:41.048
Yes, I'm sure.

04:41.081 --> 04:42.850
Where are you
getting these images?

04:42.883 --> 04:45.085
I had a friend re-task
a Chinese satellite.

04:45.118 --> 04:48.088
You have friends who
task Chinese satellites?

04:48.121 --> 04:50.691
Clem, this place has
been empty for decades.

04:50.724 --> 04:53.026
There's no record of any
traffic going in our out.

04:53.060 --> 04:55.863
How can you be so
sure he's here?

04:55.896 --> 04:56.897
Let alone alive?

05:02.903 --> 05:04.872
This is why.

05:08.075 --> 05:09.477
Where did you get this?

05:09.510 --> 05:11.479
I have friends, too.

05:13.781 --> 05:16.116
How? How did you find him?

05:16.149 --> 05:17.985
I got a call from
Lieutenant Myers.

05:18.018 --> 05:20.988
He told me an IADG
survey team found a man

05:21.021 --> 05:24.725
in a stasis tank in
an abandoned compound.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.727
A man that they believe
to be my father.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.929
I thought it was a cruel joke

05:28.962 --> 05:30.898
until they showed
me this picture.

05:40.073 --> 05:42.476
I thought you were dead.

05:42.510 --> 05:45.012
I don't know how and
I don't know why,

05:45.045 --> 05:48.382
but my dad, he's alive.

05:51.519 --> 05:52.920
Who else knows about this?

05:52.953 --> 05:54.688
(door opens)

05:54.722 --> 05:56.123
MYERS: Hey.

05:58.426 --> 06:00.528
Has your father started talking
yet, Clementine?

06:00.561 --> 06:01.971
A little bit, but...
Did you ask him?

06:01.995 --> 06:02.995
Not yet.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.836
We'll get there.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.538
But right now,

06:10.571 --> 06:12.673
his brain's gamma frequency
readings are still low.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.174
How long?

06:14.207 --> 06:16.677
Hours. Days.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.446
Look, we're in uncharted
territory here.

06:18.479 --> 06:19.989
No one's ever been
in stasis this long.

06:20.013 --> 06:22.716
Maybe we should
just let him rest.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.786
(scoffs)

06:29.056 --> 06:30.491
Fine.

06:30.524 --> 06:32.626
But there's a storm moving in,

06:32.660 --> 06:35.062
and I don't plan on
being here when it hits.

06:39.767 --> 06:41.635
Don't mind him.

06:47.841 --> 06:50.177
Stay. Okay.

06:54.715 --> 06:56.149
Dad, I'm here.

07:24.778 --> 07:27.247
Jackson Oz?
What's he got to do with this?

07:27.280 --> 07:30.751
You think he's
connected to the bomber?

07:30.784 --> 07:34.755
Mm, no, no, no.
I'm, um, I'm just...

07:34.788 --> 07:36.700
Carrying the weight of the
world on your shoulders again?

07:36.724 --> 07:40.027
You act like all of this
is somehow your fault.

07:40.060 --> 07:42.596
The spread of the
the razorbacks?

07:42.630 --> 07:45.198
The TX sterility?

07:47.935 --> 07:49.703
I get why you want
to track down Jackson

07:49.737 --> 07:51.004
as he and his crazy father

07:51.038 --> 07:53.173
are the bastards who
started this all,

07:53.206 --> 07:56.610
but you can't solve all
the world's problems.

07:56.644 --> 07:58.011
The Shepherd hunters
will find Oz.

07:58.045 --> 07:59.246
They'll make him pay.

07:59.279 --> 08:04.918
You, Dylan Green,
are a wonderful,

08:04.952 --> 08:08.188
caring, passionate man.

08:08.221 --> 08:13.193
You have saved hundreds,
if not thousands, of lives out here.

08:13.226 --> 08:15.228
And that's enough.

08:17.565 --> 08:19.132
Do you believe me?

08:19.166 --> 08:22.703
Yeah.

08:22.736 --> 08:24.137
Terrible liar, Dylan.

08:24.171 --> 08:27.575
Let's go find your hybrid lady.

08:33.780 --> 08:36.116
♪

08:42.990 --> 08:46.560
We now understand
that the TX-gas

08:46.594 --> 08:48.696
has changed the neurons
in the hypothalamus,

08:48.729 --> 08:50.139
prohibiting the
production of the hormone

08:50.163 --> 08:51.599
essential for reproduction.

08:51.632 --> 08:52.976
BOARD MEMBER: With
all due respect,

08:53.000 --> 08:54.968
Leanne, we are on the Titan here

08:55.002 --> 08:56.136
and you are explaining

08:56.169 --> 08:58.105
the mechanics of
how we are sinking.

08:58.138 --> 09:00.574
I understand your
frustration, Cal,

09:00.608 --> 09:02.776
but we have made progress.

09:02.810 --> 09:03.911
Our latest

09:03.944 --> 09:07.280
synthetic hormone, FH-562,

09:07.314 --> 09:09.349
was able to increase
gonadotropin levels

09:09.382 --> 09:11.318
by 28% in our test subjects.

09:11.351 --> 09:13.621
So, what does that mean?

09:13.654 --> 09:15.255
Ovulation.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.593
Ovulation?

09:19.627 --> 09:22.062
Now, unfortunately,
the egg wasn't viable,

09:22.095 --> 09:25.966
but even so, no one else has
been able to achieve this feat.

09:25.999 --> 09:28.702
But our goal is
not just ovulation.

09:28.736 --> 09:30.871
It's to bring a child to term.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.239
The only way to make this happen

09:32.272 --> 09:34.141
is with your continued support.

09:34.174 --> 09:36.076
Give us a moment,
please, Leanne.

09:36.109 --> 09:37.577
Mm-hmm.

09:39.647 --> 09:41.114
How's it going?

09:41.148 --> 09:43.216
Well, the fate of humanity rests

09:43.250 --> 09:45.986
on this self-important
prick, God help us.

09:47.320 --> 09:48.355
Ah.

09:48.388 --> 09:49.757
(taps remote)

09:49.790 --> 09:51.000
So, what are you thinking, Cal?

09:51.024 --> 09:52.760
You have our backing, Leanne.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.962
We will talk to the
other board members.

09:54.995 --> 09:58.666
Fantastic.
I'll let the team know.

09:58.699 --> 10:00.067
Ovulation?

10:00.100 --> 10:01.902
We're nowhere near
that milestone.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.705
All that matters is
that Cal thinks we are.

10:04.738 --> 10:08.341
Well,
then it's good we have this.

10:11.144 --> 10:13.113
The NLRP2 protein.

10:13.146 --> 10:15.082
But I thought this
wasn't viable.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.084
We found another
protein structure.

10:18.051 --> 10:19.286
The formula works.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.922
This is what we've
been waiting for.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.091
We can begin trials.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.659
Where did you get this?

10:25.693 --> 10:27.027
One of our contacts,
Jonah Sutton,

10:27.060 --> 10:28.929
got it from someone
he used to work with

10:28.962 --> 10:31.865
at the University of Michigan,
Dr. Abraham Kenyatta.

10:31.899 --> 10:34.702
Who?

10:40.173 --> 10:42.142
You figure that thing out yet?

10:42.175 --> 10:44.778
Not even close.

10:44.812 --> 10:47.715
Whatever Jackson
encountered beyond the wall,

10:47.748 --> 10:49.750
it's like nothing
I've ever seen.

10:49.783 --> 10:52.219
They could've used our
help, you know.

10:52.252 --> 10:54.254
You're worried about Clem.

10:54.287 --> 10:55.723
If Mitch is really out there

10:55.756 --> 10:56.900
and there's others
looking for him...

10:56.924 --> 11:00.227
(sighs) I know Jamie's with
her, but we've had trai...

11:00.260 --> 11:02.229
They are going to be fine.

11:04.131 --> 11:06.867
I feel sorry for anyone
who's unlucky enough

11:06.900 --> 11:09.002
to come between them and Mitch.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.273
I know, it's just...

11:13.306 --> 11:15.976
after all we've been
through together,

11:16.009 --> 11:17.711
riding the bench ain't easy.

11:17.745 --> 11:21.281
We're not riding the bench.

11:21.314 --> 11:23.416
We're raising our son.

11:32.259 --> 11:33.426
(scraping outside)

11:33.460 --> 11:34.728
What was that?

11:34.762 --> 11:37.097
It's that tree out front.

11:37.130 --> 11:38.131
I really should cut it.

11:38.165 --> 11:40.400
(both chuckle)

11:40.433 --> 11:42.302
I know, I know.

11:53.781 --> 11:55.448
(razorback snarls)

11:57.484 --> 11:59.252
(siren chirps)

11:59.286 --> 12:02.489
Okay. Okay.

12:02.522 --> 12:06.193
Call me as soon as you
have eyes on Campbell.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.295
Thank you.

12:08.328 --> 12:09.863
Still no sign of her?

12:12.332 --> 12:14.101
(sighs) I'll find her.

12:14.134 --> 12:15.374
Well, this should cheer you up.

12:16.403 --> 12:17.838
We ran some more tests.

12:17.871 --> 12:19.282
We were able to
identify the accelerant.

12:19.306 --> 12:22.042
It's a hyper-carbon,
extremely powerful.

12:22.075 --> 12:25.412
These are initial results
from the Portland bombing.

12:25.445 --> 12:28.015
It's the same hyper-carbon.
Yeah.

12:28.048 --> 12:30.017
Okay, so who's running
the case out in Portland?

12:30.050 --> 12:31.351
No one.

12:31.384 --> 12:33.186
That's hybrid territory.

12:33.220 --> 12:34.521
No agency is gonna
send personnel

12:34.554 --> 12:35.956
that far past the barrier.

12:35.989 --> 12:37.357
But what about
non-law enforcement?

12:37.390 --> 12:39.492
We need somebody out
there; we need a contact.

12:39.526 --> 12:41.294
We need somebody
who knows the area.

12:41.328 --> 12:43.797
There's an aid group out there.

12:43.831 --> 12:45.799
FEMALE VOICE: Both state
and federal agents...

12:45.833 --> 12:46.800
Wait, pause that.

12:46.834 --> 12:48.335
Go back one.

12:48.368 --> 12:51.304
Punch in on that.

12:51.338 --> 12:53.173
Unbelievable.

12:53.206 --> 12:55.542
(siren wailing)

12:58.045 --> 12:59.546
Hey, this is Detective Hale.

12:59.579 --> 13:01.514
Badge number 39374.

13:01.548 --> 13:03.884
I need priority air transport.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.452
Where are you going?

13:05.485 --> 13:06.987
Oregon.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.391
JACKSON: That's her truck.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.466
She's gone.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.068
Well,
see if she left anything behind

13:21.101 --> 13:22.469
that might tell
us where she went.

13:38.218 --> 13:39.386
Nothing.

13:53.566 --> 13:54.601
What is that?

13:54.634 --> 13:57.905
I have no idea.

14:03.576 --> 14:06.513
Hello, Jackson.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.186
What's going on?

14:13.220 --> 14:14.888
Don't worry, son.

14:14.922 --> 14:16.842
Why weren't there any
warnings about the hybrids?

14:19.326 --> 14:21.194
Go, go.

14:27.000 --> 14:27.968
I know this is scary,

14:28.001 --> 14:29.202
but stay here and stay quiet

14:29.236 --> 14:30.356
and everything will be fine.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.375
Be brave for me?

14:37.244 --> 14:38.378
Give Mommy a smile.

14:45.052 --> 14:46.987
Still no signal.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.956
Some kind of interference.

14:48.989 --> 14:51.158
So, we're on our own.

14:54.261 --> 14:56.396
(dog barking)

14:57.564 --> 14:59.332
(snarling outside)

15:02.169 --> 15:05.038
(electronic beeping)

15:05.072 --> 15:08.075
What is that?

15:08.108 --> 15:09.943
(razorback growls, glass cracks)

15:13.113 --> 15:14.081
Abe.

15:14.114 --> 15:16.516
We have to... what?

15:16.549 --> 15:19.319
(electronic beeping)

15:22.455 --> 15:24.958
The tissue sample, it's grown

15:24.992 --> 15:26.459
into a fetus.

15:26.493 --> 15:29.429
Into a baby hybrid? But how?

15:29.462 --> 15:31.264
I don't know.

15:31.298 --> 15:34.534
But this egg,
I think it's calling for help.

15:34.567 --> 15:36.369
(dog barking)

15:36.403 --> 15:38.671
The razorbacks have come for it.

15:53.253 --> 15:57.157
I've seen this kind of long-
distance communication before

15:57.190 --> 16:00.193
in mutated lions,
but that was nowhere near this powerful.

16:00.227 --> 16:02.129
(razorbacks growling)

16:02.162 --> 16:05.632
If that thing is what they
want, I say let them have it.

16:05.665 --> 16:09.069
We can't leave it here.

16:09.102 --> 16:12.505
This new hybrid has grown
from a tissue sample

16:12.539 --> 16:16.343
into a fully-developed
embryo in a matter of hours.

16:16.376 --> 16:18.211
If I can study it,

16:18.245 --> 16:21.248
somehow isolate the
hormones responsible,

16:21.281 --> 16:24.117
this embryo could pave the way

16:24.151 --> 16:26.786
to reversing the
effects of the TX-gas.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.756
You really playing the "we have
to save the world" card again?

16:29.789 --> 16:34.127
This could be the key to
solving human sterilization.

16:34.161 --> 16:35.795
We cannot leave it behind.

16:35.828 --> 16:39.266
(thunder rumbles)

16:39.299 --> 16:42.435
Sounds like the storm's moving
and we got to work fast.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.671
I'll lure them to the backyard.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.106
You take Isaac to the truck.

16:46.139 --> 16:47.283
I'll meet you on
the access road.

16:47.307 --> 16:48.308
No, no, Dariela.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.443
It's too dangerous.

16:50.477 --> 16:54.281
There may be another way.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.221
(grunts)

17:03.423 --> 17:07.227
You must feel like
Rip Van Winkle,

17:07.260 --> 17:09.529
waking up in a different world.

17:09.561 --> 17:12.432
Humanity sterilized.

17:12.464 --> 17:14.233
The West Coast fallen.

17:14.267 --> 17:17.804
Packs of monsters
roaming the streets.

17:17.837 --> 17:21.407
But the IADG,
they think that you can help.

17:21.441 --> 17:25.311
They think you know how
to stop the hybrids.

17:25.345 --> 17:27.847
Do you remember anything

17:27.880 --> 17:30.417
about how you ended
up in that tank?

17:30.450 --> 17:32.452
Who put you there or why?

17:37.157 --> 17:39.092
It's okay.

17:39.126 --> 17:42.595
Just might take some time.

17:46.366 --> 17:48.801
79, 60.

17:48.835 --> 17:52.605
79, 60?

17:52.639 --> 17:55.142
Seeing your face again,

17:55.175 --> 17:59.646
the only thing that I
can remember is 79, 60.

18:04.451 --> 18:05.752
You don't remember.

18:05.785 --> 18:09.589
The parking ticket I got
the day you were born.

18:09.622 --> 18:13.092
$79.60.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.429
Money well spent.

18:16.463 --> 18:19.499
Almost missed your birth.

18:19.532 --> 18:22.769
And I missed half
your childhood.

18:22.802 --> 18:25.805
And the past ten years.

18:29.276 --> 18:31.444
I swear, I am...

18:31.478 --> 18:35.515
I'm not missing another
second, ever.

18:35.548 --> 18:36.816
(chuckles)

18:39.619 --> 18:43.122
It's good that
you're remembering.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.535
They need you to
remember something, too.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.307
What do they want to know?

19:00.340 --> 19:04.411
They're looking for answers
about some kind of program.

19:04.444 --> 19:05.945
Blue Diaspora.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.581
I don't know what it means,

19:08.615 --> 19:12.185
but whatever it is,
it's really important.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.922
It's the reason
they came for you.

19:23.596 --> 19:25.765
We did everything we
could to find her, Dylan.

19:25.798 --> 19:28.301
Okay, I don't even know

19:28.335 --> 19:30.903
how we're supposed to sleep
with her still out there.

19:30.937 --> 19:35.242
(sighs) Well,
we live in hybrid country,

19:35.275 --> 19:36.409
beyond the barrier.

19:36.443 --> 19:39.312
We've seen our fair share of
god-awful, horrible things.

19:39.346 --> 19:40.847
We've helped
hundreds of families

19:40.880 --> 19:43.883
find their way to safety,
so I sleep fine at night,

19:43.916 --> 19:46.453
especially knowing
you're in bed beside me.

19:46.486 --> 19:48.888
(knock on door)

19:56.629 --> 19:58.231
Logan.

20:00.267 --> 20:03.570
It's a nice place you got here...
Dylan.

20:14.281 --> 20:15.815
How we doing, Dr. Morgan?

20:15.848 --> 20:17.250
His core temperature
is coming up.

20:17.284 --> 20:18.385
MYERS: That's great.

20:20.387 --> 20:22.021
Heart rate stabilized.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.324
Blood flow is improving.

20:27.527 --> 20:29.762
Well, how about your memory?

20:29.796 --> 20:31.531
Anything coming back?

20:31.564 --> 20:34.367
Yeah.

20:34.401 --> 20:38.037
I remember everything.

20:38.070 --> 20:41.040
Just waiting for you to
upgrade me to a better room.

20:41.073 --> 20:43.910
(chuckles) Well,
you got your sense of humor back.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.378
That's a good sign.

20:45.412 --> 20:47.647
So then, tell me,

20:47.680 --> 20:50.683
what do you remember
about Blue Diaspora?

20:53.686 --> 20:56.789
I'm sorry,
I don't know what that is.

20:56.823 --> 21:00.393
I understand.

21:00.427 --> 21:03.696
But my team tells me otherwise.

21:03.730 --> 21:06.499
What's inside your head,

21:06.533 --> 21:08.935
it could help save
a lot of people.

21:08.968 --> 21:10.002
How?

21:10.036 --> 21:12.038
I'm afraid that's classified.

21:12.071 --> 21:13.906
But you get back
to your old self,

21:13.940 --> 21:16.909
we get you IADG clearance,
you can help us.

21:16.943 --> 21:19.045
Help the IADG?

21:20.513 --> 21:22.515
Last I checked,

21:22.549 --> 21:24.560
you were trying to murder
every animal on the planet,

21:24.584 --> 21:27.820
so, um... no, thanks.

21:27.854 --> 21:29.856
I know your history
with our organization,

21:29.889 --> 21:32.091
with General Davies,
but that was ten years ago.

21:32.124 --> 21:35.728
I assure you,
our priority now is protecting people

21:35.762 --> 21:36.929
from the hybrid threat.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.331
And that's why we're here.

21:38.365 --> 21:40.733
But we need your help.

21:40.767 --> 21:43.570
We need you to remember.

21:43.603 --> 21:44.904
I don't know what to tell you.

21:44.937 --> 21:45.937
I've tried.

21:47.640 --> 21:48.841
There's nothing.

21:52.779 --> 21:53.946
That's all right.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.586
Well, it looks like
your gamma frequencies

21:59.619 --> 22:01.888
are still lagging behind.

22:01.921 --> 22:04.491
I got some meds that should
be able to help with that.

22:04.524 --> 22:06.526
I'll be right back.

22:11.063 --> 22:13.900
Whatever he gives you,
don't take it. Clem,

22:13.933 --> 22:15.835
what are you not telling me?

22:15.868 --> 22:16.969
We need to get out of here.

22:17.003 --> 22:20.373
These are not good people,
and they're not with the IADG.

22:20.407 --> 22:21.641
Who are they?

22:21.674 --> 22:22.909
They're Shepherds.

22:51.904 --> 22:53.906
(door opening)

23:14.026 --> 23:16.696
Who are you?

23:16.729 --> 23:18.130
Clementine.

23:18.164 --> 23:19.566
You shouldn't be down here.

23:29.141 --> 23:30.185
What are you doing down here?

23:30.209 --> 23:31.578
What am I doing down here?

23:31.611 --> 23:33.012
What are you doing down here?

23:33.045 --> 23:34.614
Clem, take it easy.
Take it easy?

23:34.647 --> 23:36.983
You have a man in a
cage on your plane.

23:37.016 --> 23:39.051
He doesn't deserve
to be called a man,

23:39.085 --> 23:40.487
not after what he did.

23:40.520 --> 23:42.088
A little dramatic,
don't you think?

23:42.121 --> 23:45.057
Shut up.
His name is Greg Mansdale.

23:45.091 --> 23:47.126
He's a Shepherd.

23:47.159 --> 23:50.162
For the last three months,
he's been giving me information,

23:50.196 --> 23:52.832
information I use against
the other Shepherds.

23:52.865 --> 23:54.967
He's one of the people
who poisoned the planet;

23:55.001 --> 23:57.570
sterilized humanity.

23:57.604 --> 23:59.706
He's one of the people
who took Mitch from us.

24:04.577 --> 24:06.713
Do you know anything
about my father?

24:09.649 --> 24:12.218
You're Mitch Morgan's girl.

24:12.251 --> 24:13.953
Well, look at you all grown up.

24:13.986 --> 24:15.187
I said shut up.

24:15.221 --> 24:16.556
(stun gun zaps) (grunts)

24:18.691 --> 24:20.035
He doesn't know what
happened to your father,

24:20.059 --> 24:22.094
but he is going to
help us find him.

24:22.128 --> 24:23.462
(door buzzes)

24:27.266 --> 24:30.803
This photo was taken
yesterday, in Siberia.

24:30.837 --> 24:32.505
An abandoned Shepherd compound.

24:32.539 --> 24:34.249
Wait, Shepherds...
Jamie, how did you find...

24:34.273 --> 24:36.543
This was taken today.

24:36.576 --> 24:37.844
Tell me what's changed.

24:39.679 --> 24:40.713
(stun gun zaps)

24:40.747 --> 24:43.249
(screaming)

24:43.282 --> 24:45.685
Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.

24:45.718 --> 24:47.787
(panting) Please.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.822
It's a hangar.

24:49.856 --> 24:52.559
And that's the shadow
from the open hangar door.

24:52.592 --> 24:54.961
It means someone's
there already.

24:56.596 --> 24:57.930
But my dad.

24:57.964 --> 24:59.866
If it's Shepherds
and not the IADG...

24:59.899 --> 25:02.134
Then we have to
be ready for them.

25:02.168 --> 25:04.003
(stun gun zaps) (screaming)

25:04.036 --> 25:06.205
(stun gun zapping)

25:10.176 --> 25:11.811
Hello.

25:11.844 --> 25:14.013
My name is Leanne Ducovny.

25:14.046 --> 25:16.949
I'm chief executive
officer of Reiden Global.

25:16.983 --> 25:19.919
And let me start
by saying thank you

25:19.952 --> 25:22.889
for taking the time
to watch this video.

25:22.922 --> 25:24.791
Now, I'm excited

25:24.824 --> 25:26.759
because Reiden Global
has made a breakthrough

25:26.793 --> 25:28.661
that we believe, with your help,

25:28.695 --> 25:32.031
will put an end to the
sterility pandemic.

25:32.064 --> 25:34.667
(growls and barks)

25:34.701 --> 25:36.268
(barks)

25:38.270 --> 25:40.172
You want to hurry it up, Abe?

25:40.206 --> 25:41.216
This should block the signal.

25:41.240 --> 25:43.810
Like a Faraday cage.

25:43.843 --> 25:45.778
(snarling)

25:45.812 --> 25:47.880
(dog barking)

25:56.255 --> 25:57.824
Can we go now?

25:57.857 --> 26:00.192
If this works.

26:01.227 --> 26:02.662
(glass shattering)

26:02.695 --> 26:03.996
(whining)

26:04.030 --> 26:07.266
(razorback snarling)

26:10.770 --> 26:11.871
(barks)

26:17.844 --> 26:19.245
Let's go, let's go.

26:21.848 --> 26:23.149
Isaac, come on.

26:23.182 --> 26:24.784
We have to hurry.

26:24.817 --> 26:26.919
Go. Go, go, go, go.

26:29.656 --> 26:31.223
You're working with
the Shepherds now?

26:31.257 --> 26:32.868
Teaming up with them was
the only chance I had

26:32.892 --> 26:34.160
at getting you back.

26:34.193 --> 26:35.695
I did what I had to.

26:35.728 --> 26:37.396
Why would they bring you along?

26:37.429 --> 26:39.007
They knew that you
would never trust them.

26:39.031 --> 26:40.900
They needed a familiar face.

26:40.933 --> 26:42.368
You know something.

26:42.401 --> 26:44.170
About Blue Diaspora.

26:44.203 --> 26:46.281
And they will do whatever it
takes to get it out of you.

26:46.305 --> 26:48.107
(alarm blares)

26:50.442 --> 26:53.279
That's the security system.

26:53.312 --> 26:55.982
Unknown aircraft coming
on its final approach.

26:56.015 --> 26:58.718
They're coming for Mitch.

26:58.751 --> 27:00.987
Well, go take care of it!
Yes, sir.

27:01.020 --> 27:03.355
Let's go, let's go.

27:03.389 --> 27:05.391
I don't know what that
is, but this seems like

27:05.424 --> 27:07.159
a good time to get out of here.

27:08.928 --> 27:10.863
Let's go. All right.

27:10.897 --> 27:12.631
(Mitch grunts) Oh.

27:21.473 --> 27:23.910
How are you a cop?

27:23.943 --> 27:25.411
It's been years...

27:25.444 --> 27:27.113
Dylan.

27:27.146 --> 27:31.050
A lot can change.

27:31.083 --> 27:32.418
Tessa seems nice.

27:32.451 --> 27:34.887
You so much as breathe
a word to her about me,

27:34.921 --> 27:36.422
I swear I will...
Easy, easy, easy.

27:36.455 --> 27:39.125
If you want to
call yourself Dylan

27:39.158 --> 27:41.027
and play hero in the badlands,

27:41.060 --> 27:42.128
be my guest, okay?

27:42.161 --> 27:45.264
I'm not here to change that.

27:45.297 --> 27:48.034
But as somebody who
knows a thing or two

27:48.067 --> 27:50.469
about lying to the
person that you love,

27:50.502 --> 27:52.739
the sooner that you come
clean, the better.

27:52.772 --> 27:54.373
(Tessa approaching)

27:58.210 --> 28:00.179
What'd I miss?

28:00.212 --> 28:02.114
Thank you.

28:02.148 --> 28:04.350
Dylan was just saying how
lucky he is to have you.

28:04.383 --> 28:07.286
Is that so?

28:07.319 --> 28:11.190
You came an awful long way
to hear about our love life.

28:11.223 --> 28:12.859
Look,

28:12.892 --> 28:14.794
I want what you want.

28:14.827 --> 28:18.297
To find the person who bombed
my precinct and your camp.

28:18.330 --> 28:20.967
The woman you're looking for

28:21.000 --> 28:23.069
is mid to late 30s.

28:23.102 --> 28:27.006
Brown hair, dark skin,
about five-seven.

28:27.039 --> 28:29.341
You've seen her?
TESSA: Just for a second.

28:29.375 --> 28:32.178
We tracked her and found her
truck, but it was a dead end.

28:32.211 --> 28:33.846
She left this behind.

28:39.351 --> 28:41.229
Have you found anything
else with this symbol on it?

28:41.253 --> 28:43.890
No. Okay. I'm gonna need to
see where you found this.

28:43.923 --> 28:45.333
If we leave right now...
There is no "we,".

28:45.357 --> 28:47.927
Detective, okay?

28:47.960 --> 28:49.461
So if you don't mind,

28:49.495 --> 28:52.464
I have people back at
camp that need my help.

28:58.004 --> 29:00.239
Look, I don't know what
the deal is with you two,

29:00.272 --> 29:02.508
but it sounds complicated.

29:02.541 --> 29:06.078
And Dylan's probably the most
uncomplicated guy I know.

29:06.112 --> 29:08.915
Well, you just...

29:08.948 --> 29:11.083
you don't know Dylan
the way that I do.

29:14.887 --> 29:16.455
SOLDIER: We've
boarded the plane.

29:16.488 --> 29:18.090
Moving in.

29:18.124 --> 29:20.226
♪

29:32.104 --> 29:33.172
Mansdale?

29:34.240 --> 29:35.842
(tape rips) Run.

29:35.875 --> 29:38.077
(gun cocks)

29:38.110 --> 29:40.112
(men grunting)

29:48.587 --> 29:50.032
CLEMENTINE: This isn't going
to work; you can barely stand.

29:50.056 --> 29:51.457
We have to try.

29:52.925 --> 29:54.093
Oh, is that right?

29:54.126 --> 29:55.427
Please. We were just... Shut up!

29:55.461 --> 29:58.530
You... sit down.

29:58.564 --> 29:59.866
No.

29:59.899 --> 30:02.902
I said sit... down. No.

30:02.935 --> 30:04.003
He doesn't know any... ah!

30:04.036 --> 30:05.905
(groaning): Ow, ow.

30:07.173 --> 30:08.917
Well, maybe he just needs
a little motivation.

30:08.941 --> 30:09.941
No, no, no, no!

30:22.621 --> 30:24.156
Hold this.

30:28.594 --> 30:30.930
Let's give Daddy some space.
Come on.

30:37.937 --> 30:39.939
(razorbacks snarling)

30:49.982 --> 30:52.051
There's two outside by the...

31:05.664 --> 31:07.900
ABRAHAM: Isaac, don't move.

31:07.934 --> 31:11.938
Everyone stand still.

31:11.971 --> 31:14.073
(whispers): Why
isn't it attacking?

31:14.106 --> 31:15.942
It's looking for the egg.

31:15.975 --> 31:17.476
Then let's give it to him.

31:17.509 --> 31:19.445
ABRAHAM: It's too important.

31:19.478 --> 31:22.548
It won't matter if we don't
make it out of here alive.

31:22.581 --> 31:24.951
(growls) (gasps)

31:26.218 --> 31:27.586
(yells)

31:30.589 --> 31:32.524
Daddy! Daddy! Abe! Abe!

31:34.593 --> 31:36.295
Daddy!

31:36.328 --> 31:38.364
(growling and snarling)

31:45.337 --> 31:47.306
(Abraham coughs)

31:47.339 --> 31:49.108
Daddy, are you okay?

31:49.141 --> 31:51.210
Yeah.

31:51.243 --> 31:52.644
(gasps)

31:52.678 --> 31:56.015
I'm okay, Isaac.

31:58.484 --> 32:00.052
JACKSON: Keep your leg elevated.

32:00.086 --> 32:02.288
All right? Just take it easy.

32:03.689 --> 32:05.491
Someone's calling for you.

32:05.524 --> 32:06.993
MAN: Help with that one.

32:07.026 --> 32:08.560
This is Dylan.

32:08.594 --> 32:11.263
Dylan.

32:11.297 --> 32:13.565
You look more like
a Jackson to me.

32:15.234 --> 32:17.103
Who is this?

32:17.136 --> 32:18.604
It's me, Jackson.

32:18.637 --> 32:20.672
You, your lions

32:20.706 --> 32:22.508
and that adorable little
girlfriend of yours

32:22.541 --> 32:24.410
have been chasing after me.

32:24.443 --> 32:26.212
You have something of mine.

32:26.245 --> 32:27.746
The disc.

32:27.779 --> 32:30.049
Consider it a gift.

32:30.082 --> 32:33.085
So you'll remember me when
your world crumbles around you.

32:35.087 --> 32:38.324
Who do you think you are?

32:38.357 --> 32:40.559
96 people are dead
because of you.

32:40.592 --> 32:42.094
You understand that?

32:42.128 --> 32:43.562
Why? I always imagined

32:43.595 --> 32:45.664
you were smarter
than you appeared.

32:45.697 --> 32:48.567
Who are you?

32:48.600 --> 32:51.137
You destroyed my world once.

32:51.170 --> 32:53.372
Now it's my turn.

32:53.405 --> 32:55.117
Yeah, well,
let me tell you something, okay?

32:55.141 --> 32:57.543
You have no idea who
you're up against.

32:57.576 --> 32:59.245
(line clicks)

33:01.313 --> 33:03.115
(shouting)

33:03.149 --> 33:05.484
DALLAS: You give
me Blue Diaspora,

33:05.517 --> 33:07.519
I give you your daughter. Easy.

33:07.553 --> 33:09.621
But if you keep on playing dumb,

33:09.655 --> 33:11.623
you are gonna wish

33:11.657 --> 33:12.658
you never woke up. No!

33:12.691 --> 33:15.527
Huh? Aah! Dad, please, tell him!
Dad, please!

33:15.561 --> 33:19.165
Look, I-I... I told you.
I don't know what that is.

33:19.198 --> 33:20.575
You're a liar! Dad, tell him!
I'm not lying,

33:20.599 --> 33:23.035
I don't know what that is.
I don't know how to help you.

33:23.069 --> 33:24.536
Look,
I will do anything you want,

33:24.570 --> 33:26.105
just, d-don't hurt her.

33:26.138 --> 33:27.582
Do you love your daughter?
Don't hurt her!

33:27.606 --> 33:29.541
Do you want to see
your daughter alive?!

33:29.575 --> 33:31.277
Don't hurt her.
Help me! Three...

33:31.310 --> 33:32.511
I can't help you! Two!

33:32.544 --> 33:33.812
Don't, don't, don't! One.

33:33.845 --> 33:35.447
Don't.

33:45.691 --> 33:47.059
(wire zapping)

33:51.630 --> 33:53.332
You okay? Yeah.

33:53.365 --> 33:55.367
I'm fine, I think.

33:58.737 --> 34:00.339
You know how to use that?
Do you?

34:10.382 --> 34:12.150
Stop.

34:13.652 --> 34:16.322
Dad?

34:18.690 --> 34:20.859
Dad, is that really you?
Who the hell are you?

34:20.891 --> 34:23.661
It's okay, I'm,
I'm his daughter, Clementine.

34:23.695 --> 34:25.431
You are not Clementine. I am.

34:26.532 --> 34:28.100
What? Don't listen to her.

34:28.134 --> 34:30.369
Let's shoot her and let's
get out of here. What?

34:30.402 --> 34:32.070
Dad, I came here to save you.

34:33.405 --> 34:35.306
Don't call me that. Dad.

34:35.341 --> 34:36.851
We need to get out of here.
You either!

34:36.875 --> 34:39.478
Dad, I know this is hard
to understand right now.

34:39.511 --> 34:41.112
Stop talking.
Don't listen to her.

34:41.147 --> 34:42.813
Stop talking, both of
you, stop talking.

34:42.848 --> 34:45.717
Don't do it, Dad.
Shut up. Shut up!

35:00.399 --> 35:02.768
Why don't we all
just take a breath,

35:02.801 --> 35:04.870
and put the guns away.

35:04.903 --> 35:06.272
You first.

35:09.675 --> 35:11.843
See?

35:11.877 --> 35:14.646
No gun.

35:15.947 --> 35:18.384
Now I'm gonna reach
into my pocket,

35:18.417 --> 35:19.918
Dad. No. No. I can prove

35:19.951 --> 35:21.887
I'm your daughter.
Keep your hand out...

35:21.920 --> 35:23.222
Stay the hell out of this.

35:23.255 --> 35:24.523
No, Dad!

35:31.297 --> 35:32.631
(drops gun)

35:53.585 --> 35:54.720
My parking ticket.

35:56.688 --> 35:58.824
Dad. (gun clatters)

35:58.857 --> 36:00.826
I didn't know you had it in you.

36:02.561 --> 36:03.462
Who are you?

36:03.495 --> 36:04.539
You're gonna tell me everything

36:04.563 --> 36:06.298
about Blue Diaspora.

36:06.332 --> 36:07.666
Let's go.

36:07.699 --> 36:09.301
(gunshots)

36:11.703 --> 36:13.572
Are you okay?

36:18.477 --> 36:19.745
Nice beard.

36:22.514 --> 36:24.550
JACKSON: She called me.

36:24.583 --> 36:27.286
That bitch called me.

36:27.319 --> 36:28.587
Who called you?

36:28.620 --> 36:31.557
The bomber.

36:31.590 --> 36:33.292
What did she say?

36:33.325 --> 36:34.893
Well, she knew my name.

36:34.926 --> 36:36.595
She was taunting me.

36:36.628 --> 36:39.365
Like it was personal.

36:39.398 --> 36:41.400
Because it is.

36:42.901 --> 36:44.703
I I.D.'ed the bomber

36:44.736 --> 36:47.306
with, uh, with DNA off of
that disc that you guys found.

36:47.339 --> 36:48.574
Her name is Abigail Westbrook.

36:48.607 --> 36:50.442
This is her genetic profile.

36:50.476 --> 36:51.843
Okay.

36:51.877 --> 36:53.712
When I got the
preliminary results,

36:53.745 --> 36:56.248
I just assumed you must've
somehow contaminated the sample.

36:56.282 --> 36:59.251
So I had my tech run the tests
again, but the results,

36:59.285 --> 37:01.520
the exact same.
What are you saying?

37:01.553 --> 37:06.258
You and this Abigail Westbrook
share multiple genetic markers.

37:06.292 --> 37:10.396
That's why I thought it was
contaminated, but it wasn't.

37:10.429 --> 37:13.932
Jackson,
Abigail Westbrook is your sister.

37:25.577 --> 37:27.646
CLEMENTINE: You sure you
know what you're doing?

37:27.679 --> 37:28.856
The bullet passed clean through.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.616
So I'll have to watch
it for infection,

37:30.649 --> 37:31.917
but you're gonna be fine.

37:33.419 --> 37:35.287
Well, if you're looking
for a second opinion,

37:35.321 --> 37:36.488
I can take a look.

37:39.491 --> 37:40.959
How you feeling?

37:40.992 --> 37:42.628
Like I shot my daughter.

37:47.399 --> 37:48.600
I see it, now.

37:50.336 --> 37:51.870
I couldn't see it
before, I'm sorry.

37:51.903 --> 37:53.439
What?

37:53.472 --> 37:54.540
You.

37:54.573 --> 37:56.608
Given the circumstances,

37:56.642 --> 37:58.610
I think I'll let it slide.

38:00.078 --> 38:03.315
Maybe these will help.

38:11.923 --> 38:15.494
Um, I'll leave you two alone.

38:15.527 --> 38:16.628
Wait, Clem.

38:16.662 --> 38:18.364
Don't worry, Dad.

38:18.397 --> 38:19.865
Not going anywhere.

38:29.074 --> 38:32.878
So...

38:32.911 --> 38:34.880
how did you end
up with the plane?

38:34.913 --> 38:36.482
(laughs softly)

38:36.515 --> 38:38.025
Well, we saved the
world on this thing,

38:38.049 --> 38:40.752
I thought I should
keep it in the family.

38:54.032 --> 38:56.034
What happened?

38:56.067 --> 38:59.037
Last thing I remember is, uh,

38:59.070 --> 39:03.909
teeth and claws,
ripping into me.

39:03.942 --> 39:05.877
Whoever saved my life, they...

39:05.911 --> 39:08.547
They didn't do it out of the
kindness of their hearts.

39:08.580 --> 39:10.716
You were in Siberia.

39:10.749 --> 39:13.919
At the edge of the world.

39:13.952 --> 39:18.089
Whoever put you in that tank,

39:18.123 --> 39:20.826
they didn't want
anybody to find you.

39:22.661 --> 39:24.630
They kept you away from me...

39:27.098 --> 39:29.601
from the world, for ten years.

39:31.970 --> 39:33.772
I'm going to find
out who did this.

39:33.805 --> 39:35.741
I'm gonna find out why.

39:35.774 --> 39:39.445
I'm gonna make them pay.

39:45.551 --> 39:48.019
Finally got him to fall asleep.

39:48.053 --> 39:52.123
He's afraid the razorbacks will
get him while he's sleeping.

39:52.157 --> 39:55.427
The world's become
a dangerous place.

39:55.461 --> 39:58.864
So many things we have
to protect him from.

39:58.897 --> 40:00.966
We got lucky today.

40:00.999 --> 40:04.603
Looking back, maybe we
should've gone with Clementine.

40:04.636 --> 40:05.871
(both laugh)

40:05.904 --> 40:07.906
(knock on door)

40:14.813 --> 40:16.648
Sorry to disturb you, sir.

40:16.682 --> 40:17.816
Can we come in?

40:17.849 --> 40:19.150
Sure.

40:19.184 --> 40:21.186
You all right?

40:21.219 --> 40:24.155
We had a hybrid incident.

40:24.189 --> 40:27.225
We'll alert IADG.

40:27.258 --> 40:28.760
But that's not why we're here.

40:28.794 --> 40:30.028
My kid's sleeping.

40:30.061 --> 40:31.830
Mind if we talk in the kitchen?

40:31.863 --> 40:34.666
Yes, ma'am. It's this way.

40:39.871 --> 40:42.541
If this isn't about the
hybrids, why are you here?

40:42.574 --> 40:43.942
An emergency government protocol

40:43.975 --> 40:45.977
has been initiated in
the tri-county area.

40:46.011 --> 40:48.179
What protocol?

40:48.213 --> 40:49.581
We have an introductory video

40:49.615 --> 40:51.449
that explains it
better than I could.

40:53.719 --> 40:57.556
Hello.
My name is Leanne Ducovny.

40:57.589 --> 41:00.225
I'm chief executive
officer at Reiden Global.

41:00.258 --> 41:02.961
And let me start
by saying thank you

41:02.994 --> 41:05.096
for watching this video.

41:05.130 --> 41:07.966
I'm excited to tell
you that Reiden Global

41:07.999 --> 41:09.134
has made a breakthrough;

41:09.167 --> 41:11.503
that we believe, with your help,

41:11.537 --> 41:14.272
will put an end to the
sterility pandemic.

41:14.305 --> 41:15.907
But sacrifices... What?

41:15.941 --> 41:18.510
Will need to be made
for the greater good.

41:18.544 --> 41:20.646
Which is the reason
that I'm addressing you.

41:20.679 --> 41:22.581
Your child has been selected

41:22.614 --> 41:24.850
to participate in
our pilot program.

41:24.883 --> 41:26.518
He or she will be
safe in our custody.

41:26.552 --> 41:28.153
Isaac!

41:28.186 --> 41:29.788
Ma'am... Hey, hey!

41:29.821 --> 41:31.523
(yells)

41:31.557 --> 41:32.758
Isaac!

41:32.791 --> 41:33.959
Isaac!

41:35.961 --> 41:38.597
Isaac! Isaac!

41:38.630 --> 41:40.999
Isaac! Isaac!

41:41.032 --> 41:42.668
(slow motion): Isaac!

41:42.701 --> 41:46.004
♪

41:46.037 --> 41:48.540
(slow motion): Mommy!

41:48.574 --> 41:51.543
Daddy!

42:27.746 --> 42:30.048
Please, God, please.

42:32.818 --> 42:33.819
(heart beating)
