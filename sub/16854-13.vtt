00:15.938 --> 00:19.798
Oh, man.
We're losing this guy.

00:20.443 --> 00:23.579
That's basal constriction.
Glenn, I-I-I don't know what to do.

00:23.646 --> 00:24.646
He's got a B.T.O.F.

00:24.714 --> 00:26.415
We're gonna have to hit him
with some atropine.

00:26.482 --> 00:28.384
No, no, no, no, Glenn,
that could kill him!

00:28.485 --> 00:30.853
- Tha... That's reckless!
- Get your hands off me.

00:30.921 --> 00:32.822
Ju...

00:35.459 --> 00:39.095
Wow. That was...was exciting.

00:39.163 --> 00:41.764
- That was exciting.
- Eh.

00:41.832 --> 00:43.291
Glenn, I never would
have had the boots

00:43.367 --> 00:45.734
to pull off a stuff like you pulled off
in there today.

00:45.802 --> 00:48.003
I am amazed at what you do
every day in that O.R.

00:48.070 --> 00:49.771
Eh, it ain't brain surgery.

00:49.839 --> 00:51.840
Well, but that is literally what it is.

00:51.907 --> 00:53.975
I guess I've been
doing it so long that...

00:54.042 --> 00:56.272
- I don't feel anything anymore.
- Huh.

00:56.307 --> 00:57.811
Look, I'll show you.
Hit me in the face.

00:57.879 --> 00:59.680
No, no, that...
That's not my style.

00:59.748 --> 01:02.717
- Hit me in the face!
- Okay.

01:04.852 --> 01:06.654
Hey! Take that crap outside.

01:06.755 --> 01:07.855
Hey, hey, it's cool.

01:07.923 --> 01:09.891
See? I didn't feel anything at all.

01:09.958 --> 01:11.626
So, Cat and Chief, uh,

01:11.693 --> 01:14.962
I have this gift certificate
for free premium cable television,

01:15.030 --> 01:18.632
but, you know, you can only redeem it
if you're pregnant.

01:18.700 --> 01:20.735
Do you guys know anyone like that?

01:20.802 --> 01:22.770
- Hmm.
- Pregnant?

01:22.838 --> 01:25.683
Uh, guys?
I'm 8 1/2 months pregnant.

01:25.718 --> 01:27.284
Oh, thank God.

01:27.319 --> 01:28.566
We thought that you might be,

01:28.602 --> 01:29.979
but we just didn't know
how to go about it.

01:30.014 --> 01:31.579
It was one of the...
You know, it's rude to ask.

01:31.647 --> 01:33.514
Hi, everybody. Hi, Chief.

01:33.582 --> 01:35.083
What do I have here?

01:35.184 --> 01:38.687
Two tickets to see Oprah live
in Tokyo!

01:38.754 --> 01:39.788
Get out of town!

01:39.855 --> 01:41.922
Anybody want to come
hang out with me?

01:41.990 --> 01:43.723
- No!
- I'd really like to...

01:43.791 --> 01:44.891
Huge Oprah fanatic.

01:44.959 --> 01:47.026
Well, Val, you can't go
'cause you're pregnant.

01:47.093 --> 01:48.527
Blake, you're a clown.

01:48.594 --> 01:51.595
Glenn, you're Jewish.
You can see Oprah any old time.

01:51.663 --> 01:53.863
- Lola, you've got that thing.
- What?

01:53.964 --> 01:56.699
And Cat and Owen...

01:56.766 --> 02:00.002
So that leaves Chief.

02:00.070 --> 02:01.290
Hey, Chief!

02:01.325 --> 02:02.905
- Would you like to go with me, Chief?
- No.

02:02.973 --> 02:04.774
I'll see you outside in 10.

02:04.875 --> 02:07.977
Hello. Hello. Hello.

02:08.044 --> 02:10.746
He's saying "hello,"
but he's going out...

02:13.450 --> 02:15.962
Okay, thank you so much, Margaret,

02:16.019 --> 02:18.587
for sharing your marriage struggles
with all of us.

02:18.655 --> 02:22.477
Your stories are an inspiration to us,
if also quite boring.

02:22.512 --> 02:24.793
Now then, Lola, tell us,
how was your week?

02:24.861 --> 02:26.962
Well, I'm still a little depressed.

02:27.030 --> 02:28.597
I feel so empty inside.

02:28.665 --> 02:32.367
The Torah speaks
of the concept of "Tzedakah."

02:32.435 --> 02:36.638
This is doing good for other people
as a means for personal fulfillment.

02:36.706 --> 02:39.541
- Sounds tiring.
- You can start small.

02:39.609 --> 02:41.776
Do one thing for a friend
who's in need.

02:41.877 --> 02:43.671
Take Owen here, for example.

02:43.706 --> 02:46.348
Just the other day in one
of our private, confidential sessions,

02:46.449 --> 02:49.802
he confessed to me
that he's never had an orgasm.

02:49.837 --> 02:52.120
- Whoa!
- I'm trying to help you, Owen.

02:52.187 --> 02:56.457
I think Lola here could assist you
in having your first orgasm.

02:56.525 --> 02:59.560
It would be the ultimate in giving,
don't you think?

02:59.628 --> 03:01.362
Is that true?
Have you never...?

03:01.430 --> 03:03.764
He's never had an orgasm.
He's told me many times.

03:03.832 --> 03:05.900
I've come close.
I just haven't sealed the deal.

03:05.967 --> 03:08.102
Go ahead.
Let it out, Owen. Cry.

03:08.170 --> 03:11.773
- He cries a lot in our private sessions.
- Come on, man!

03:11.840 --> 03:15.277
Oh, Chief! I am so excited

03:15.312 --> 03:17.746
because we rarely get to spend
this one-on-one time.

03:17.813 --> 03:20.749
Well, don't get used to it.
This is a one-time deal.

03:20.816 --> 03:22.717
Hey, do these windows work?

03:22.785 --> 03:25.687
- Why?
- Oh, I fart a lot on bumpy roads.

03:25.788 --> 03:26.754
Uneven sphincter.

03:26.822 --> 03:29.090
Oh, yeah, it'll be like roses to me.

03:29.158 --> 03:32.393
Oh, I can absolutely
guarantee it that it will not.

03:33.028 --> 03:37.865
I have no romantic feelings
for Owen, like, whatsoever.

03:37.933 --> 03:39.967
Maybe if you came up
with a few ground rules,

03:40.035 --> 03:41.669
you'd be more comfortable
with the idea.

03:41.737 --> 03:42.971
Like...

03:43.038 --> 03:45.840
No kissing on the mouth,
no eye contact, no pet name,

03:45.908 --> 03:47.441
no snuggling, no whispering,

03:47.509 --> 03:49.844
the lights stay on,
and I get to pick the music?

03:49.912 --> 03:53.047
- Like those kind of ground rules?
- Exactly, yes, that kind.

03:53.149 --> 03:56.751
Okay. I will have sex with you.

03:56.819 --> 04:01.423
But you will refer to me as Lola
or Dr. Spratt only.

04:01.491 --> 04:04.159
No compliments will be paid,
positive or negative.

04:04.227 --> 04:05.961
No nodding, no shaking of the head,

04:06.029 --> 04:10.099
and we are done by 6:00 p.m. tonight,
orgasm or no.

04:10.200 --> 04:11.067
Also...

04:11.135 --> 04:12.068
I'm telling you, man,

04:12.136 --> 04:13.970
I can't experience an emotional reaction
from anything.

04:14.037 --> 04:14.971
What about this?

04:16.940 --> 04:19.875
I mean, I get that it's cute,
intellectually,

04:19.942 --> 04:21.726
but it's... nothing.

04:23.180 --> 04:25.047
Hey, what's with the suitcase?

04:25.148 --> 04:27.044
Oh, I'm, uh, flying to New York

04:27.079 --> 04:28.984
so I can be with my family
when I go into labor.

04:29.052 --> 04:31.553
Honey, you're too far along
to get on that plane.

04:31.621 --> 04:34.690
I mean, the pressure from the cabin's
gonna make your stomach explode.

04:34.791 --> 04:37.518
Thanks, Cat, but...
I'm a grown woman and a doctor.

04:37.553 --> 04:38.936
I think I'll be fine.

04:38.971 --> 04:39.962
Who said anything
about you being stupid?

04:40.030 --> 04:40.796
I never said that.

04:40.864 --> 04:41.997
- What?
- What?

04:42.098 --> 04:44.133
I know you didn't.
Why would you say that?

04:44.201 --> 04:46.502
- Why would I even think that?
- Oh, okay, good.

04:46.570 --> 04:48.704
So you'll cancel your flight
and have your baby here?

04:48.772 --> 04:51.007
- No.
- You're stupid!

04:51.074 --> 04:52.008
You know what?

04:52.109 --> 04:54.194
I'm getting on that plane
no matter what,

04:54.234 --> 04:56.103
and there's nothing you can do
to stop me.

04:56.138 --> 04:58.114
Because you're stupid.

04:58.182 --> 05:00.517
"...And I never saw them again.

05:00.584 --> 05:04.154
The end."

05:05.656 --> 05:07.457
Nothing.

05:07.525 --> 05:09.402
- Really?
- Not a thing.

05:09.437 --> 05:12.439
Wow!
I read the whole book to you.

05:12.474 --> 05:14.532
No saying words
that have to do with moisture.

05:14.599 --> 05:19.102
Example... Damp, wet, juicy,
moist, flood, swampy.

05:19.170 --> 05:23.673
No waving, no flailing,
no butt stuff, obviously.

05:23.741 --> 05:24.941
Ah!

05:25.008 --> 05:26.709
Yeah!

05:26.777 --> 05:28.711
- Oh!
- Nothing.

05:28.779 --> 05:29.845
Hey, guys, guys!

05:29.913 --> 05:31.113
I know you're not military,

05:31.181 --> 05:33.512
but we do have rules against
fireworks around here.

05:33.547 --> 05:35.885
Oh, I'm sorry.
I usually do not break the rules.

05:35.953 --> 05:37.720
I do. I love breaking rules.

05:37.788 --> 05:38.854
I do crazy things. Try me.

05:38.955 --> 05:41.739
Look, I am cool,
but some of these other guys

05:41.774 --> 05:43.756
might be a little uptight
and what have you,

05:43.791 --> 05:44.927
just 'cause we're so close
to the weapons locker room.

05:44.995 --> 05:47.763
Weapons locker room?
What, is that where they keep all the guns?

05:47.831 --> 05:50.065
Well, that's top-secret, but, yes,

05:50.133 --> 05:52.067
that's exactly where they keep
all the guns.

05:52.135 --> 05:54.269
- Show me.
- Okay.

05:56.072 --> 05:59.942
Hey, um, is this the Osaka Airport?

06:00.009 --> 06:00.676
Great, okay.

06:00.743 --> 06:04.379
So, I'm calling on behalf of a
gang of terrorists that I'm with.

06:04.480 --> 06:08.601
Yeah, we put a very large bomb,
uh, somewhere in the airport,

06:08.636 --> 06:11.621
so I think you should probably
ground all of your planes.

06:11.688 --> 06:12.655
I know, okay.

06:12.723 --> 06:14.123
All right, well, good luck with that.

06:14.191 --> 06:16.159
All right, I love you...

06:16.226 --> 06:18.127
Bye.

06:23.701 --> 06:25.101
Another bomb threat.

06:25.169 --> 06:27.486
Williams, contact Ft. Rosenthal.

06:27.538 --> 06:30.735
Have them send some boys over
to check out the airport.

06:32.659 --> 06:34.338
So you like weapons,
this is the room for you.

06:34.373 --> 06:35.844
And if you ever want
to check the place out

06:35.912 --> 06:39.513
when I'm not around,
the code is 3-4-5-8

06:39.581 --> 06:44.416
delta echo,
but you didn't hear that from me.

06:44.484 --> 06:46.184
No answer?

06:46.251 --> 06:49.852
All right, pull up some satellite images
over Ft. Rosenthal.

06:49.920 --> 06:51.748
Let's see what's going on.

06:51.783 --> 06:54.789
You can't say any words related
to and or having to do with intimacy.

06:54.857 --> 07:01.660
For example...
Connection, deep, yes, good, and...

07:01.728 --> 07:04.134
No, I think that's it. Okay?

07:04.169 --> 07:07.586
So, meet me in O.R. 3 in one hour,
showered and powdered.

07:07.621 --> 07:08.631
It's a deal.

07:08.699 --> 07:15.770
Oh, and one more thing...
No falling in love.

07:16.338 --> 07:17.905
What's up her twat, huh?

07:17.973 --> 07:19.373
Captain,
you need to see this right away.

07:19.441 --> 07:22.443
These images out of Ft. Rosenthal
are less than an hour old.

07:22.510 --> 07:25.279
Get these images analyzed.
They don't look military.

07:25.380 --> 07:28.122
I want to know what kind
of explosions these are.

07:30.452 --> 07:32.487
All right.

07:32.554 --> 07:34.222
Are you ready?

07:34.290 --> 07:35.924
Are you gonna take your clothes off?

07:35.991 --> 07:37.592
No. No. Okay.

07:41.297 --> 07:43.098
- Should I?
- No.

07:43.199 --> 07:45.433
All right, okay.

07:45.501 --> 07:48.336
- Okay, now if you could just...
- Unzip?

07:48.404 --> 07:51.005
Yeah, I'm gonna move this to the side.

07:51.073 --> 07:52.140
If you could open that.

07:52.208 --> 07:54.342
Yep, good, and there we go.

07:54.410 --> 07:56.477
No, don't look me in the eyes.
Don't look at me.

07:56.545 --> 07:57.979
Now, how does it feel so far?

07:58.047 --> 07:59.948
Russian roulette.

08:00.016 --> 08:01.850
One bullet, six chambers.

08:01.951 --> 08:03.418
Maybe this will get
my adrenaline flowing.

08:03.486 --> 08:05.286
No, come on,
that's way too dangerous.

08:05.354 --> 08:08.122
Yeah, guys, personally,
I'm cool with it, but...

08:08.190 --> 08:09.390
Ah! Come on, come on!

08:10.192 --> 08:11.892
Nothing.
Here, you try it.

08:11.994 --> 08:13.327
Maybe I'll feel something if it's you.

08:13.395 --> 08:15.529
No way.
I've never even shot a gun before.

08:15.630 --> 08:17.464
You think the first time
should be at my own head?

08:17.532 --> 08:18.432
Try it, clown!

08:22.604 --> 08:24.471
Uh-oh.

08:27.675 --> 08:30.376
Captain, it looks like
the power has gone out at the Fort.

08:30.444 --> 08:32.645
What the hell is going on?

08:32.712 --> 08:36.482
My flight was canceled
due to a bomb threat.

08:36.583 --> 08:39.284
Cat! You didn't!

08:39.352 --> 08:42.087
What if they trace the call?
You could go to prison!

08:42.155 --> 08:43.557
Don't be so dramatic, Val.

08:43.624 --> 08:46.293
It was a bomb "threat,"
not a bomb "promise."

08:46.360 --> 08:47.260
Wait.

08:47.361 --> 08:50.296
I got a trace report from where
the bomb threat was called.

08:50.364 --> 08:51.998
Looks like it came from...

08:52.099 --> 08:54.367
inside the base.

08:54.468 --> 08:55.969
Call in the SEAL team.

08:56.037 --> 08:58.271
I want boots on the ground...

08:58.339 --> 09:00.140
Boots with guns.

09:00.207 --> 09:03.209
Team Spider, you are cleared
to enter the perimeter.

09:03.277 --> 09:04.911
Exercise extreme caution.

09:05.012 --> 09:06.479
- Hey, what's this?
- Aah!

09:06.547 --> 09:08.160
You don't need to know
what that is,

09:08.194 --> 09:09.570
but it's a rocket launcher.

09:09.605 --> 09:12.952
Do not engage.
It's recon mission only.

09:15.255 --> 09:17.423
Ow! What is that?

09:18.725 --> 09:21.461
What is going on? Geez.

09:21.528 --> 09:23.463
Nothing. Get out of here.

09:23.531 --> 09:25.265
You're going into labor, aren't you?

09:25.332 --> 09:27.100
Was it the siren that triggered it?
How fun!

09:28.169 --> 09:30.570
Can I put some coconut oil
on your perineum?

09:30.638 --> 09:33.139
Power must have
knocked the phones out, too.

09:33.207 --> 09:34.441
The perimeter alarm was set off.

09:34.542 --> 09:36.276
What's a perimeter alarm?

09:36.377 --> 09:37.544
Could be nothing.

09:37.645 --> 09:40.981
A dog could have tripped the alarm
or it could be a terrorist invasion.

09:41.049 --> 09:43.116
Either way,
it was nice to meet you guys.

09:43.184 --> 09:44.351
Got to go back to my post.

09:44.419 --> 09:46.486
- Here, put this on.
- Why?

09:46.587 --> 09:49.890
I'm gonna go shoot something.
Looks like either a dog or some terrorists.

09:49.958 --> 09:53.694
You know, Oprah's studio
looks so much smaller on TV.

09:53.762 --> 09:55.196
This place is huge!

09:55.263 --> 09:58.599
Pretty impressive warm-up band.
Who is it?

09:58.667 --> 10:00.806
The, uh, Tokyo Philharmonic.

10:00.841 --> 10:02.436
I was gonna guess Goo Goo Dolls.

10:02.504 --> 10:06.140
You know, I am literally, like,
addicted to meatballs.

10:06.207 --> 10:09.100
Team Spider, what intel
can you provide from the air?

10:09.135 --> 10:12.145
Now, where's the damn dog?
I need to feel.

10:12.213 --> 10:13.947
Ah, terrorists.

10:14.015 --> 10:15.181
Maybe there's a dog in there.

10:15.249 --> 10:17.350
Whoa, whoa!
We don't know that!

10:17.418 --> 10:19.252
Hard left! We're taking fire!

10:19.320 --> 10:20.320
Oh...

10:20.388 --> 10:22.689
Oh, that's Americans,
not terrorists.

10:22.757 --> 10:24.357
NORAD, we're being fired on!

10:24.425 --> 10:26.193
Enemies unknown, numbers unknown!

10:26.260 --> 10:27.427
Request immediate backup!

10:27.495 --> 10:28.595
You got it, Spider.

10:28.696 --> 10:30.230
A unit's on its way.

10:33.601 --> 10:34.734
Here comes Oprah.

10:34.802 --> 10:36.878
Blackhawk Nine-zero-niner,

10:36.913 --> 10:38.572
you're clear to engage the enemy.

10:38.640 --> 10:41.108
Safety's off.

10:41.176 --> 10:43.110
Uh-huh?

10:43.178 --> 10:45.679
Thanks for trying, Lola,
but I just don't think it's working.

10:45.747 --> 10:46.714
This is ridiculous.

10:46.781 --> 10:48.431
I'm sorry that I called in a bomb threat

10:48.466 --> 10:51.418
that prevented you from having
your baby with your loved ones, okay?

10:51.486 --> 10:53.287
# When I am laid #

10:53.354 --> 10:55.288
That's not op-e-rah.

10:55.356 --> 10:57.724
Oh, I see what happened here.

11:12.469 --> 11:15.705
Honestly, Chief, I thought
it was Oprah, not opera.

11:15.773 --> 11:18.575
Just give me five minutes, please,
I know you're gonna love this.

11:18.642 --> 11:22.111
Well, this better get good
before I run out of meatballs.

11:22.179 --> 11:25.414
Engage! Blow it all to hell!

11:25.482 --> 11:29.130
Aah! Run! Get to cover!

11:31.488 --> 11:34.122
- Glenn!
- This is happening, Blake!

11:34.190 --> 11:35.424
I can feel this!

11:38.428 --> 11:41.263
I'm alive!

11:41.331 --> 11:45.100
Glenn!

11:48.946 --> 11:58.042
# May my wrongs create #

11:58.188 --> 12:01.965
# No trouble #

12:02.526 --> 12:05.595
# No trouble #

12:05.696 --> 12:12.001
# In thy breast #

12:22.146 --> 12:24.547
Isn't this moving, Chief?

12:24.615 --> 12:26.549
Huh? What? No. Whatever.

12:26.617 --> 12:29.485
I mean, it's no...bowl of meatballs.

12:32.155 --> 12:34.323
Thought you said
no eye-looking-into?

12:34.391 --> 12:37.226
Oh. Well, I mean, I wasn't...

12:38.295 --> 12:40.229
What the hell is that?
It sounded like a bomb.

12:40.297 --> 12:42.031
I think I felt something.

12:42.098 --> 12:44.700
Really?
Well, maybe the bomb is the key.

12:45.569 --> 12:48.071
Let's go outside,
closer to the bombs!

12:48.138 --> 12:49.539
Closer to the bombs.
Good idea.

12:49.640 --> 12:51.507
Now let me bring your baby
into this world.

12:51.575 --> 12:53.709
It's too late.
Somebody else is already helping me.

12:53.777 --> 12:55.544
- Who?
- Hello?

12:55.612 --> 12:56.612
She is.

12:56.680 --> 12:58.047
Scrub up, little girl.

12:58.114 --> 13:00.049
Aah! Come on!

13:00.116 --> 13:01.717
Hang in there, Glenn!

13:01.785 --> 13:02.985
What the...?

13:03.053 --> 13:05.187
Huh?

13:05.255 --> 13:07.156
Oh, my gosh!
They shot Josh!

13:07.224 --> 13:09.425
Oh, my God.
I thought this was you.

13:09.526 --> 13:12.094
I thought it was you, Glenn.
It was so confusing!

13:12.162 --> 13:14.464
It's just Josh,
the other Jewish doctor on our staff.

13:14.531 --> 13:16.666
He was our best
Jewish pulmonary specialist.

13:16.734 --> 13:17.567
Well, I...

13:17.635 --> 13:19.069
I don't know if he was the best.

13:19.170 --> 13:21.404
Well, he's one
of the top two or three I think.

13:21.472 --> 13:24.042
Uh, what about Jake?
Uh, Jake Weingart?

13:24.077 --> 13:26.115
- Jacob's really good.
- He's good. He's good.

13:26.150 --> 13:28.712
- He's very good.
- But, hey...

13:28.779 --> 13:29.746
I'm glad you're okay.

13:29.814 --> 13:32.115
Oh, hey, Blake,
don't worry about me.

13:32.182 --> 13:33.783
Nothing can hurt me.
Absolutely...

13:36.420 --> 13:37.620
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

13:37.688 --> 13:39.688
It's hot, it's hot! The bullet's hot!

13:39.790 --> 13:41.690
- Relax! Relax!
- I can't!

13:41.792 --> 13:42.591
It's a hot bullet!

13:43.693 --> 13:45.661
It sounds like the 4th of July
out there!

13:45.728 --> 13:48.564
It's gonna be like
the 4th of July in here, too.

13:48.631 --> 13:49.998
But really wet.

13:50.066 --> 13:52.795
So, here... Put these gloves on.

13:52.830 --> 13:53.702
Don't you think
you're being a little stubborn

13:53.803 --> 13:56.034
by letting a 4-year-old girl
deliver your baby

13:56.069 --> 13:57.039
instead of a trained O.B.?

13:57.106 --> 13:59.107
Dr. Little Girl is trained.

13:59.175 --> 14:02.043
- Right, Dr. Little Girl?
- I can draw a unicorn and a Dracula.

14:02.111 --> 14:04.079
See?! Can you do that, Cat?

14:04.180 --> 14:05.547
You know I can't.

14:05.648 --> 14:08.983
Aah! Aah!

14:09.051 --> 14:10.418
Hey, is that an orgasm?

14:10.486 --> 14:12.287
No! This is terrifying!

14:12.388 --> 14:14.990
I think we should go back inside!

14:15.058 --> 14:17.359
Hey, what are you lookin' at?

14:17.427 --> 14:19.695
- Sorry!
- Hey, hey, I think I felt something.

14:19.763 --> 14:22.631
Maybe you like having
other people around.

14:22.699 --> 14:24.266
That gives me an idea.

14:24.334 --> 14:26.035
Come on.

14:26.103 --> 14:28.104
Thanks for coming
on such short notice, Dori.

14:28.171 --> 14:31.741
Oh, it's no problem.
Beth is covering me at the front desk.

14:31.809 --> 14:33.509
Is there any progress, Owen?

14:33.577 --> 14:37.780
No, but if I could just
make a little tweak to the situation...

14:37.848 --> 14:41.751
Oh, yeah, yeah.

14:41.819 --> 14:45.622
Mm, yeah,
this is the real Tzedakah here.

14:45.689 --> 14:47.532
Aah!

14:47.567 --> 14:49.596
It's all right!
All right, I've stopped the bleeding,

14:49.631 --> 14:52.162
- but I got to get you out of here.
- No, no, no!

14:52.229 --> 14:53.430
No, we can't go out there.

14:53.497 --> 14:56.032
They're shooting bullets,
and the bullets are so hard.

14:56.133 --> 14:57.634
They're hard like lead and copper.

14:57.702 --> 14:59.402
An... And they're hot!

14:59.470 --> 15:02.172
Hot like a cat on a hot tin roof!

15:02.240 --> 15:03.406
Shut up!

15:03.474 --> 15:04.408
Snap out of it!

15:04.509 --> 15:06.143
I'm not gonna let you die!

15:06.210 --> 15:08.245
Aah!

15:08.346 --> 15:10.547
It's okay, lady.
Have more peanut butter.

15:10.615 --> 15:13.684
- Oh, Val, enough!
- Don't touch me!

15:13.751 --> 15:15.452
Dr. Little Girl, more peanut butter!

15:15.520 --> 15:18.256
Dr. Little Girl,
with all due respect...

15:20.225 --> 15:20.991
Aah!

15:21.059 --> 15:23.160
- Why are they still firing at us?
- I don't know!

15:23.228 --> 15:24.194
The phones must still be out.

15:24.262 --> 15:25.729
There's no way to tell them
that we're Americans.

15:25.797 --> 15:27.464
They still think we're the terrorists.

15:27.532 --> 15:31.084
If there was just a way... A way
to let them know we're Americans...

15:33.371 --> 15:34.371
Wait. That's it.

15:34.439 --> 15:36.674
If I can raise the American flag,
then they'll know.

15:36.775 --> 15:38.609
Or... Or we could just
stay here and cuddle.

15:57.296 --> 15:59.063
I got to raise the flag.

15:59.131 --> 16:01.032
It's the only way to save us.

16:01.800 --> 16:03.434
Blake?!

16:03.501 --> 16:08.170
Bla-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a...

16:08.238 --> 16:12.207
a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-ke!

16:20.150 --> 16:22.385
I take it back.

16:22.452 --> 16:24.353
I don't want to feel.

16:24.421 --> 16:26.989
It's too much. I was kidding.

16:27.090 --> 16:29.159
I was wrong. I was young

16:29.194 --> 16:32.895
and just a snot-nosed little kid
who knows nothing about nothing.

16:34.231 --> 16:36.166
We're all just little kids,

16:36.233 --> 16:38.487
thinking with our penises,

16:39.437 --> 16:42.841
our vaginas, respectively.

16:44.309 --> 16:46.243
And now I'm a man...

16:46.311 --> 16:49.346
And my friend's in trouble.

16:49.414 --> 16:52.249
And that's the secret...

16:52.317 --> 16:55.018
Helping others.

16:55.086 --> 16:58.221
Tzedakah.

16:58.289 --> 17:01.058
Duh. It's like, "duh."

17:05.630 --> 17:07.396
What is she saying?

17:07.464 --> 17:10.378
She's saying that she loves the king

17:10.414 --> 17:14.503
but she didn't realize it
until he died.

17:14.570 --> 17:16.472
- Oh, it's almost 6:00.
- What?

17:16.540 --> 17:17.606
Look, we don't have much time,

17:17.674 --> 17:19.075
but if this fails,

17:19.142 --> 17:21.420
I just want you
to know I've really enjoyed

17:21.454 --> 17:23.412
- spending this time with you.
- Me, too, Lola.

17:23.480 --> 17:26.182
For some reason
I feel so much closer to you.

17:26.250 --> 17:29.519
It's amazing what a few hours
of full penetration can do.

17:29.620 --> 17:33.590
And I know we're not
allowed to fall in love,

17:33.657 --> 17:38.395
but if we could,
I'd fall in love with you.

17:38.462 --> 17:40.196
- Whoa.
- What?

17:40.264 --> 17:41.331
I just felt something.

17:41.398 --> 17:43.299
Oh. What's happening?

17:43.367 --> 17:45.068
Oh, no, wait.

17:45.135 --> 17:48.971
No, don't wait. Don't wait.
Keep going. Keep going, please.

17:54.245 --> 17:55.985
It's scary down there.

17:56.020 --> 17:58.181
Look, let the grown-ups
handle this, Dr. Little Girl.

17:58.248 --> 17:59.215
Go find your mommy.

17:59.316 --> 18:02.419
My mommy flew on an airplane
with a baby in her tummy

18:02.486 --> 18:03.653
and her tummy went boom.

18:03.721 --> 18:08.458
# Amen #

18:08.526 --> 18:11.528
Oh, my God.
You were right, Cat.

18:11.595 --> 18:12.528
That could have been me.

18:12.630 --> 18:14.030
I told you so, stupid.

18:24.408 --> 18:26.009
- Aah!
- You're almost there!

18:26.110 --> 18:28.645
- Just breathe!
- Oh, God! I owe you my life!

18:28.712 --> 18:30.680
I'm gonna name my baby
after you, Cat.

18:30.748 --> 18:32.349
What's your full name?

18:32.416 --> 18:33.717
Catholomule.

18:33.785 --> 18:34.651
What?

18:34.719 --> 18:36.553
Stop! Stop!
We're Americans!

18:36.621 --> 18:39.623
- Blake!
- Look at the flag!

18:39.690 --> 18:42.192
- Come on!
- Aah!

18:42.259 --> 18:43.426
Aah!

18:43.494 --> 18:45.259
Here it comes!

18:47.331 --> 18:50.667
Blake! Blake!

19:11.389 --> 19:14.724
Aah! Aah!

19:20.085 --> 19:21.282
Is this what you wanted?

19:21.317 --> 19:23.600
- Yes!
- Is this what you wanted?!

19:23.701 --> 19:25.702
I'm coming!

19:25.770 --> 19:28.038
It's coming!

19:28.106 --> 19:31.441
I'm coming! Aah!

20:16.387 --> 20:17.621
Stand down.

20:17.688 --> 20:19.289
Everyone stand down!

20:19.357 --> 20:20.757
They're Americans!

20:20.825 --> 20:23.760
They're going! They're going!

20:42.178 --> 20:43.145
Attention, staff...

20:43.213 --> 20:44.835
War is not the answer

20:44.870 --> 20:47.516
unless the question is
"What is the singular of 'wars'?"

20:47.583 --> 20:48.983
That is all.

20:49.051 --> 20:51.820
So wait...
You have had an orgasm before?

20:51.921 --> 20:54.523
I didn't realize
that's what an orgasm was.

20:54.590 --> 20:57.926
I've had thousands of those.
I think it was a semantics thing.

20:57.994 --> 20:59.294
Excuse me.

20:59.395 --> 21:03.265
How is it possible that we were
gone for 24 little hours

21:03.333 --> 21:04.944
and this place is such a mess?

21:04.979 --> 21:06.845
It seems like a bomb went off
in here.

21:06.880 --> 21:08.169
That is literally what happened.

21:08.237 --> 21:10.539
That's what it seems like to me.
That a bomb went off in here.

21:10.607 --> 21:12.875
It seems that way
because that is what happened.

21:12.942 --> 21:15.644
That's the feeling I'm getting,
exactly...

21:15.712 --> 21:18.380
- I'm feeling a bomb went off in here.
- There was bombs.

21:18.448 --> 21:20.716
You're feeling right.
You're feeling right.

21:20.783 --> 21:22.918
Well, then we're on the
same page because, wow!

21:22.985 --> 21:24.286
Anybody who came in here

21:24.387 --> 21:26.788
would feel the same way...
A bomb went off in here.

21:26.856 --> 21:29.490
We just got attacked.

21:29.558 --> 21:31.558
Well, I would like
to talk to those people

21:31.659 --> 21:32.593
to see if they have
the same feeling I do.

21:32.660 --> 21:34.461
You're talking
to all of them right here.

21:34.562 --> 21:38.299
- Raining hellfire from above.
- Screaming.

21:38.400 --> 21:40.963
Well, it seems very "bomby."

21:41.370 --> 21:42.470
