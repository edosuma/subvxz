WEBVTT

00:03.578 --> 00:04.995
On six.

00:11.515 --> 00:14.098
Mr. Anderson, LAPD. Open up.

00:14.151 --> 00:15.900
Take it down.

00:17.354 --> 00:19.187
How may I help you? Ugh!

00:19.239 --> 00:21.156
Go, go, go, go, go!

00:22.776 --> 00:26.027
I don't know what you're
looking for, but it's not here.

00:29.440 --> 00:31.140
Bedroom one ... nothing.

00:33.810 --> 00:35.777
Nothing in bedroom two.

00:35.812 --> 00:38.529
Oh, thank God you're here.

00:38.565 --> 00:40.948
Damn it! Nothing in the bathroom.

00:40.984 --> 00:43.067
- Sorry to disturb you sir.
- No, no, no!

00:43.119 --> 00:44.986
I've been here for six months.

00:48.158 --> 00:50.374
I told you. There's nothing here.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:04.541 --> 01:06.157
It's here.

01:18.088 --> 01:20.138
Mr. Anderson, it's illegal
to have a pet ferret

01:20.173 --> 01:21.556
in the state of California.

01:21.591 --> 01:24.142
You're going away for a long time.

01:27.347 --> 01:29.564
Let's take out the trash.

01:43.530 --> 01:46.197
You were right about Anderson.
He did have an illegal ferret.

01:46.249 --> 01:47.699
Anderson may have had the ferret,

01:47.701 --> 01:50.084
but he definitely didn't
bring him into the state.

01:50.120 --> 01:52.203
We got to find out
who's running this thing.

01:52.205 --> 01:54.873
I think we've let him sweat long enough.

02:01.257 --> 02:03.090
- How you doing, Ian?
- Pretty good.

02:03.142 --> 02:05.142
Wrong answer.

02:05.178 --> 02:07.061
- Fine?
- That's more like it.

02:07.096 --> 02:09.597
You're looking at 50 years
for possession of a ferret,

02:09.649 --> 02:11.148
unless you're willing to play ball.

02:11.184 --> 02:13.234
We could use another power hitter.

02:13.269 --> 02:15.236
Where'd you get the
ferret? Just give me a name.

02:15.271 --> 02:18.572
- Don't you have a name?
- Yeah, it's Angie, but I never liked it.

02:18.608 --> 02:21.025
- How about Meegan?
- Where'd you get the ferret?

02:21.027 --> 02:22.743
If I tell you his name, he'll kill me.

02:22.779 --> 02:24.161
"If I tell you his name, he'll kill me."

02:24.197 --> 02:25.830
"If I tell you his name, he'll kill me."

02:25.865 --> 02:27.581
No, no, no. It's more
like, "he's gonna kill me.

02:27.617 --> 02:29.784
The bad guy, I'm afraid
he's gonna kill me."

02:29.836 --> 02:31.202
I got it. I got it. It's like,

02:31.254 --> 02:33.204
"I'm a dead man if I tell you his name.

02:33.206 --> 02:35.006
"Nyah, nyah, nyah." That's really good.

02:35.041 --> 02:36.707
That's really good. Yeah.

02:36.732 --> 02:38.816
Okay. His name is...

02:38.878 --> 02:40.628
Aah!

02:40.680 --> 02:42.013
Aah!

02:42.048 --> 02:43.214
Alan.

02:43.216 --> 02:44.799
- Uh, Oscar.
- Arthur.

02:44.851 --> 02:46.183
- Arthur. Arthur?
- Ira.

02:46.219 --> 02:47.802
Ira. Ira? Ira?

02:47.854 --> 02:49.387
Oh.

02:49.389 --> 02:51.105
I wish I could fall asleep that fast.

02:51.140 --> 02:52.890
I just toss and turn.

02:52.892 --> 02:55.026
Tribeca, Geils! Get out here.

02:55.061 --> 02:57.812
We have a problem.

02:59.315 --> 03:01.315
What are you doing here?

03:01.367 --> 03:04.568
Hello, Meegan. I heard you were
thinking about changing your name.

03:04.620 --> 03:08.205
How'd I know that? Because I'm fish
and game, and we know everything.

03:08.241 --> 03:10.074
Bless you.

03:10.076 --> 03:12.993
What?  Damn it.

03:13.046 --> 03:14.373
This is special agent Laurie Partridge,

03:14.473 --> 03:16.506
Fish and Game Division, rodent task force.

03:16.509 --> 03:18.772
The best of the best of the best.

03:19.014 --> 03:20.897
I believe you have a ferret for me.

03:20.932 --> 03:24.245
That ferret is evidence
from our bust, Laurie.

03:24.300 --> 03:26.300
Wait, is there some history here?

03:26.352 --> 03:28.886
As a matter of fact, this building
used to be a ball bearing factory.

03:28.938 --> 03:30.003
Aah!

03:30.003 --> 03:32.120
Tribeca and I were
roommates in the academy.

03:32.172 --> 03:35.290
We were like brothers, except
we were girls and unrelated.

03:35.342 --> 03:38.676
That all ended when we were both up for
the same spot in the Fish and Game Division

03:38.712 --> 03:40.929
and Laurie threw me under the bus.

03:40.964 --> 03:43.465
You fell under that bus, and I thought
that was water under the bridge.

03:43.467 --> 03:45.850
It was a dry riverbed, and you know it.

03:45.886 --> 03:48.052
- Didn't we bury the hatchet?
- You buried the hatchet.

03:48.105 --> 03:49.888
It was my favorite hatchet,
and I never found it.

03:49.941 --> 03:51.307
All right, since you have no ax to grind,

03:51.358 --> 03:53.191
I'll be taking that ferret.

03:53.226 --> 03:54.866
Lieutenant, you're gonna let this happen?

03:54.895 --> 03:56.311
Sorry, Tribeca, we have no choice.

03:56.313 --> 03:57.979
It's Fish and Game's game.

03:57.981 --> 04:00.365
Its a multimillion dollar
underground ferret operation,

04:00.400 --> 04:02.817
and we could bust the
whole thing right now.

04:02.869 --> 04:05.236
Why don't you go back
to solving people murders

04:05.288 --> 04:07.288
and leave the real police work to us?

04:07.324 --> 04:09.958
You son of a... It's not worth it, Tribeca!

04:09.993 --> 04:12.043
Oh, you need your partner to bail you out?

04:12.078 --> 04:14.162
You son of a... it's not worth it!

04:14.164 --> 04:16.214
Is this the kind of precinct you run?

04:16.249 --> 04:18.466
You son of a... hey,
hey, it's not worth it.

04:18.502 --> 04:21.302
You better watch out, or I'll have to
take your partner to animal control.

04:21.338 --> 04:23.087
You son of a...

04:23.141 --> 04:25.141
It's not worth it! Nice
try, Missy, you already went.

04:25.175 --> 04:27.225
Back of the line.

04:27.260 --> 04:31.262
LAPD. Hmm. Bunch of animals.

04:33.817 --> 04:35.934
Oh, excuse me.

04:35.986 --> 04:38.019
Without that ferret,
we're back to square one.

04:38.021 --> 04:41.322
Oh, you mean this ferret?

04:41.358 --> 04:44.025
How did you...

04:44.027 --> 04:46.744
I'm pausing so you can tell us.

04:46.780 --> 04:47.946
It was simple.

05:09.052 --> 05:11.352
Oh, excuse me.

05:11.389 --> 05:13.138
Nice work, Scholls.

05:13.190 --> 05:15.356
It's okay, sweetie, you're safe now.

05:15.392 --> 05:17.892
Ow! You son of a...

05:17.944 --> 05:20.144
It's not worth it! It's not
worth it! It's not worth it!

05:22.949 --> 05:25.366
Dr. Edelweiss will be able to tell us

05:25.368 --> 05:26.868
where this ferret came from.

05:30.457 --> 05:36.628
Computer: What can I do for you,
Detectives Tribeca and Julie?

05:36.681 --> 05:38.681
Sorry, Gails.

05:38.716 --> 05:40.850
Sorry,Geles.

05:40.884 --> 05:43.384
Sorry, Gills.

05:43.387 --> 05:44.803
Sorry, Gladstone.

05:44.855 --> 05:47.272
Oh, this isn't more efficient at all.

05:47.307 --> 05:48.940
What can I do for you?

05:48.975 --> 05:51.276
We're hoping you could tell us
about our furry little friend.

05:51.311 --> 05:52.977
Oh, very well. Greg!

05:53.029 --> 05:55.446
Yeah?

05:55.482 --> 05:57.315
We were actually talking about the ferret.

05:57.367 --> 05:58.733
Sorry, Greg. Never mind.

05:58.735 --> 06:01.236
Sure, I understand.

06:01.238 --> 06:04.739
We need some help figuring
out where this thing is from.

06:04.792 --> 06:06.542
He's not a thing. He's a living creature.

06:06.577 --> 06:09.245
More specifically, it's a
rare Himalayan soft belly.

06:09.296 --> 06:12.297
Now, lucky for us, ferrets
eat everything in their path,

06:12.332 --> 06:14.299
so all we have to do is
look inside its belly,

06:14.334 --> 06:15.750
find out where it's been, and possibly,

06:15.752 --> 06:17.252
that might lead us to the smuggler.

06:17.304 --> 06:18.803
Well, let's cut this bad boy open, then.

06:18.838 --> 06:21.256
You can't cut open this
ferret. He's a human being.

06:21.308 --> 06:24.676
Actually, he's a she.
You can tell by her teats.

06:24.728 --> 06:26.928
Don't worry, Detective.
As the expression goes,

06:26.980 --> 06:28.680
there's more than one way
to look inside a ferret.

06:30.317 --> 06:34.602
I spent some time as a
veterinary gynecologist.

06:34.654 --> 06:35.937
I don't think that's a thing.

06:35.939 --> 06:37.739
Yes, and a judge agreed with you.

06:37.774 --> 06:39.691
Now, let's see what we have here.

06:41.745 --> 06:43.778
Looks like she ate an apple.

06:43.830 --> 06:46.497
That's good. Apples, apples, apples.

06:46.533 --> 06:50.835
Uh, apples, orchard, farm, Granny Smith,

06:50.870 --> 06:54.789
grandma, nursing home,
soft food, applesauce.

06:54.841 --> 06:59.093
Apples, apples, orchard, farm.

06:59.129 --> 07:00.545
Granny Smith?

07:00.597 --> 07:01.963
Grandma, nursing home,

07:01.965 --> 07:05.683
soft food, applesauce, apples, farm.

07:05.719 --> 07:09.053
Granny Smith, grandma, nursing home,

07:09.105 --> 07:13.024
soft foods, applesauce, apples.

07:13.059 --> 07:14.475
Let's just keep looking, shall we?

07:15.812 --> 07:18.446
Hey, that's my badge.

07:18.481 --> 07:21.482
And those are my handcuffs.

07:26.072 --> 07:28.406
Are you guys looking at me?

07:29.626 --> 07:31.125
Ooh, that's interesting.

07:31.161 --> 07:33.328
I thought we had just one valuable ferret.

07:33.380 --> 07:35.830
In fact, we have six. She's pregnant.

07:35.832 --> 07:37.465
- Adorable.
- Disgusting.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.467
Six Himalayan soft bellies.

07:39.502 --> 07:41.970
On the black market, in today's economy,

07:42.005 --> 07:44.389
I would say that puts
our mystery supplier out

07:44.424 --> 07:47.892
roughly $193,850.

07:47.927 --> 07:51.346
That's a lot of money
for a sack of long rats.

07:51.398 --> 07:52.282
It doesn't bring us any closer

07:52.482 --> 07:54.783
- to figuring out who the supplier is.
- Hey, what's that?

07:54.819 --> 07:56.902
It appears to be a cufflink.

07:56.904 --> 07:59.121
Zoom in.

07:59.157 --> 08:00.790
F.B.

08:00.825 --> 08:04.409
Looks like we found our first...

08:04.468 --> 08:05.834
Lead.

08:06.384 --> 08:07.008
I don't get it.

08:07.108 --> 08:09.025
This guy runs an animal rights charity.

08:09.077 --> 08:10.777
How could he get caught
up in illegal ferrets?

08:10.829 --> 08:12.245
I don't know, but I do know

08:12.281 --> 08:16.033
that I have a lot of
questions for Mr. Frontbut.

08:16.085 --> 08:19.787
It is pronounced "Froont boot."

08:23.738 --> 08:25.317
- Thank you for seeing us.
- Mm.

08:25.317 --> 08:27.917
Yes, my animal conservation
efforts keep me very busy,

08:27.919 --> 08:30.753
but it is my life's passion,
or as we say in German...

08:30.805 --> 08:33.640
Es ist eine arbeit der liebe!

08:33.674 --> 08:35.674
Oh, such a beautiful language.

08:35.727 --> 08:37.760
Danke. Mr. Frontbut.

08:37.812 --> 08:39.011
"Froont boot." Fr...

08:39.063 --> 08:40.263
Front? "Froont boot."

08:40.315 --> 08:41.764
"Frountbut."

08:41.816 --> 08:43.182
"Froont boot." "Frount."

08:43.235 --> 08:44.684
"Froont boot." "Froont boot."

08:44.736 --> 08:46.019
"Frount."

08:46.071 --> 08:47.320
Frontbut. No, sir. Sir?

08:47.355 --> 08:48.938
It's "froont boot."

08:48.940 --> 08:50.607
Frontbut.

08:50.659 --> 08:52.775
No, you're not making any
effort to change the sounds.

08:52.777 --> 08:54.777
- Mr. "froont boot."
- Frontbut.

08:54.779 --> 08:56.279
You wouldn't happen to know anything

08:56.331 --> 08:58.281
about illegal ferret
trafficking, would you?

08:58.333 --> 09:00.033
No, no.

09:00.085 --> 09:02.669
No, I have devoted my entire
life to protecting animals,

09:02.704 --> 09:04.837
not to exploiting them.

09:04.873 --> 09:06.706
And for the record, I love ferrets.

09:06.758 --> 09:09.042
I believe they deserve
much better than to be pets.

09:09.094 --> 09:12.028
That's very admirable, but you
are aware that since the ban,

09:12.063 --> 09:14.230
the price of illegal
ferrets has skyrocketed.

09:14.266 --> 09:16.065
Oh, yeah, it has...

09:16.101 --> 09:17.333
Which is terrible.

09:17.369 --> 09:18.968
Someone stands to make a lot of money

09:19.004 --> 09:20.336
smuggling them into the state.

09:20.372 --> 09:23.106
If I were rolling in illegal ferret money,

09:23.141 --> 09:26.309
would I be hosting a charity
poker tournament tonight

09:26.361 --> 09:28.978
with a $50,000 buy-in?

09:30.216 --> 09:32.819
$193,850?

09:32.919 --> 09:35.252
That's an oddly specific number.

09:35.254 --> 09:37.004
Excuse me.

09:41.960 --> 09:43.492
Oh, never mind.

09:43.494 --> 09:44.994
I've dabbled in poker.

09:45.046 --> 09:47.580
- Is this tournament open to anyone?
- Absolutely.

09:47.632 --> 09:50.633
Anyone who has the $50,000 buy-in.

09:50.668 --> 09:52.551
One last question.

09:52.587 --> 09:56.672
Any idea how your cufflink was
found inside an illegal ferret?

09:56.724 --> 09:58.507
Well, I travel all over the world.

09:58.559 --> 10:00.760
It may have fallen when
I was in the mountains.

10:00.812 --> 10:02.845
You know, these Himalayan soft
bellies, they'll eat anything.

10:02.897 --> 10:05.481
I didn't say it was a Himalayan soft belly.

10:05.516 --> 10:07.767
Well, you didn't say it
wasn't. Damn it, he's good.

10:07.819 --> 10:09.101
Thank you.

10:09.153 --> 10:10.736
So, if there's nothing else,

10:10.772 --> 10:13.022
I have a very busy day protecting animals.

10:16.911 --> 10:20.029
Guten tag.

10:22.719 --> 10:24.258
We got to get into this tournament.

10:24.358 --> 10:26.975
- Where are we gonna get $50,000?
- We'll figure it out.

10:27.027 --> 10:29.061
Let's just hope that Laurie
partridge doesn't get in our way.

10:29.063 --> 10:31.613
Aah! Once again, Tribeca,

10:31.649 --> 10:33.565
you see that there's
nothing you can possess

10:33.567 --> 10:35.951
that the Fish and Game cannot take away.

10:35.987 --> 10:37.537
No, not Ferret Fawcett.

10:37.571 --> 10:38.904
And as for your decoy,

10:38.906 --> 10:42.074
the joke's on you because
they were delicious.

10:43.627 --> 10:45.911
And now I'm off to take down Frontbut.

10:45.914 --> 10:48.047
Toodles.

10:49.480 --> 10:52.481
We're getting that money.

10:56.947 --> 10:59.248
$50,000? Are you nuts?

10:59.283 --> 11:00.999
It's the only way to take Frontbut down.

11:01.035 --> 11:03.285
If we win, he has no money
to run his ferret network.

11:03.287 --> 11:06.872
I'm not gonna let you risk the
department's money on a gamble.

11:06.924 --> 11:08.924
It's only gambling if
there's chance involved,

11:08.959 --> 11:10.208
and I've never lost at poker.

11:10.261 --> 11:11.466
The only way to get that kind of money

11:11.466 --> 11:13.466
would be to shut the police
department down for a day.

11:13.502 --> 11:15.622
Is that what you want? All
right, let's give it a try.

11:37.830 --> 11:40.080
All right, Tribeca,
there is another option.

11:40.082 --> 11:43.417
There is one place we could get
our hands on that kind of money,

11:43.419 --> 11:45.752
but it is gonna be a hell of a reach.

11:48.974 --> 11:50.891
Yeah, I can't...

11:50.927 --> 11:53.344
Geils, can you get up?

11:53.395 --> 11:54.845
Yeah. I can't get it. I can't.

11:54.897 --> 11:56.263
It's so...

11:56.265 --> 11:58.432
Yeah. You got it?

11:58.484 --> 12:00.267
You know, my fingers are touching it,

12:00.269 --> 12:02.352
- but I think I'm pushing it back.
- Don't push it back.

12:02.404 --> 12:04.071
Just step aside, okay?

12:04.106 --> 12:06.773
I-I got it. I got it.

12:06.775 --> 12:08.659
Well done, Tribeca.

12:08.694 --> 12:10.911
Swear jar... I forgot about this. Yeah.

12:10.946 --> 12:13.030
All right.

12:13.082 --> 12:14.998
We're $1 short.

12:15.034 --> 12:16.750
- Shit!
- Oh! Oh!

12:16.785 --> 12:19.286
Oops. That's on me, guys. Sorry.

12:20.789 --> 12:22.339
- All right, let's go.
- Perfect.

12:22.374 --> 12:24.675
Be careful out there, you guys.

12:31.433 --> 12:32.599
Hey.

12:32.635 --> 12:34.301
That's a cute little number.

12:34.353 --> 12:36.186
Thanks. Let's go.

12:36.221 --> 12:39.356
Oh, Detectives.

12:39.391 --> 12:42.059
I'm so surprised to see you
at such a high-stakes game.

12:42.111 --> 12:43.393
You know what the buy-in is.

12:43.445 --> 12:45.729
Yes, it's the minimum
amount you have to pay

12:45.814 --> 12:47.481
to enter a poker tournament.

12:47.533 --> 12:49.149
Have a seat.

13:11.784 --> 13:14.418
Hello, Tribeca.

13:14.454 --> 13:16.921
Partridge! Stand down.

13:16.956 --> 13:18.756
This is my bust.

13:18.791 --> 13:21.959
And this... is my bust.

13:22.011 --> 13:26.964
The game is Texas Hold
'em. Minimum bet... $10,000.

13:27.016 --> 13:28.716
Are you sure about this?

13:28.718 --> 13:30.601
I told you, I've never lost.

13:30.636 --> 13:32.887
You don't play the cards.
You play the players.

13:32.939 --> 13:34.689
Everyone has a tell.

13:34.724 --> 13:37.475
My cards suck! I got no chance of winning.

13:38.728 --> 13:40.111
I've got two 7s!

13:40.146 --> 13:43.230
- A Jack and a 5.
- Oy vey.

13:45.485 --> 13:47.034
I'm all-in.

13:47.070 --> 13:48.486
What the hell are you doing?

13:48.538 --> 13:49.987
You didn't even look at your cards.

13:50.039 --> 13:51.455
It's called bluffing.

13:51.491 --> 13:53.908
I fold.

13:53.960 --> 13:55.743
I fold.

13:55.745 --> 13:56.994
I fold.

13:59.549 --> 14:00.915
I'm all-in, as well.

14:06.923 --> 14:10.991
I have a 3 and a card
that tells you how to play.

14:13.096 --> 14:15.429
Pair of kings. Oh, good lord.

14:15.481 --> 14:17.431
Don't worry, we get five more cards.

14:17.483 --> 14:21.569
King, king, king, king,
king. Seven kings wins.

14:21.604 --> 14:23.771
- Damn it!
- You told me you never lose.

14:23.773 --> 14:27.241
Don't feel bad, Detectives.
As we say in Germany...

14:27.276 --> 14:30.027
Es war ein vergnugen, mit ihnen zu spielen!

14:30.079 --> 14:32.696
I don't have to listen
to this. We won the war.

14:37.670 --> 14:39.787
Vodka rocks.

14:41.174 --> 14:44.291
I'm sorry, Tribeca. I
thought I had it back there.

14:44.293 --> 14:45.793
We're not out yet.

14:45.845 --> 14:47.128
I think I know how we can get some money.

14:47.130 --> 14:48.596
We just need some help.

14:48.631 --> 14:51.549
Good luck with that.
I'm gonna get some air.

14:51.601 --> 14:53.601
All right, Tribeca. I'ma see what I can do.

14:57.607 --> 14:59.723
Mother [Bleep]

14:59.776 --> 15:02.693
dumb [Bleep] [Bleep]

15:02.728 --> 15:04.612
[Bleep] [Bleep]

15:04.647 --> 15:07.815
stupid... uh, a little help here?

15:07.850 --> 15:09.066
[Bleep] [Bleep]

15:09.118 --> 15:10.144
I think this is gonna take too long.

15:10.183 --> 15:11.483
Thanks, anyway. Never mind.

15:12.320 --> 15:14.206
- Damn it.
- Wait.

15:14.259 --> 15:16.793
- Let me buy you back in.
- Why?

15:16.845 --> 15:19.379
It took us six years to
get this close to Frontbut.

15:19.432 --> 15:21.849
- You did it in two days.
- One day, actually.

15:21.884 --> 15:23.384
Damn it, I hate you so much.

15:23.436 --> 15:25.386
Why? What did I do to you?

15:25.438 --> 15:27.605
I was always the best at everything,

15:27.640 --> 15:29.774
and then I met you in
the academy, and suddenly,

15:29.809 --> 15:34.645
I was "most likely to be
overshadowed by Angie Tribeca."

15:34.697 --> 15:37.732
- You still carry that around with you?
- Every day.

15:39.485 --> 15:42.319
The crazy thing is, I always
thought that you were the best.

15:42.372 --> 15:44.538
Can't we just agree to both be the best,

15:44.574 --> 15:46.490
only I'm slightly better?

15:46.542 --> 15:47.825
Yeah, I can live with that.

15:51.497 --> 15:53.464
Thank you, Laurie Partridge.

15:53.499 --> 15:55.666
Come on, get happy.

16:02.141 --> 16:06.026
Take the lunch pail... leave the sandwich.

16:11.784 --> 16:13.818
Hmm.

16:13.870 --> 16:18.038
Well, it looks like it's
down to you and me, Tribeca.

16:18.074 --> 16:20.741
Shall we make this a
little more interesting?

16:20.743 --> 16:23.911
No, let's keep it exactly this interesting.

16:35.425 --> 16:37.224
$10,000.

16:37.260 --> 16:40.845
What are we going to do about
that chip on your shoulder?

16:42.765 --> 16:44.098
Oh.

16:45.768 --> 16:48.986
I see your $10,000. There it is.

16:50.990 --> 16:54.275
And I raise you $40,000.

17:36.355 --> 17:37.502
Hmm.

17:37.629 --> 17:39.463
All-in.

17:45.368 --> 17:47.535
I call.

17:47.570 --> 17:49.987
Tribeca.

17:50.039 --> 17:52.323
It's me. What do you have?

17:52.325 --> 17:54.041
Two pair.

17:54.077 --> 17:57.161
You should have learned from your friend.

17:57.213 --> 17:59.080
Don't bluff a bluffer.

18:01.634 --> 18:03.000
Full house.

18:05.421 --> 18:08.923
I've only got two pair of two 9s.

18:08.975 --> 18:11.842
Ooh!

18:11.894 --> 18:15.346
Huh! Yeah! Walked right into that one!

18:15.348 --> 18:17.848
Not so fast!

18:17.850 --> 18:20.401
I'm afraid you can't take the
money at any pace, Detective.

18:22.489 --> 18:24.856
Danke, Fish and Game.

18:24.907 --> 18:26.357
How did you know?

18:26.359 --> 18:28.659
You and your associates
are not exactly subtle.

18:29.579 --> 18:33.080
Drop the guns and back away slowly!

18:33.116 --> 18:37.118
Now, you and I are going
to collect these chips,

18:37.170 --> 18:39.453
exchange them for cash, and
then I'm going to continue

18:39.505 --> 18:42.039
to smuggle illegal ferrets
into the state of California.

18:42.091 --> 18:43.541
Not on my watch!

18:43.543 --> 18:44.925
Huh?

18:44.961 --> 18:46.177
Geils!

18:47.964 --> 18:49.513
Oh!

18:49.549 --> 18:52.933
Oh! I feel fuzzy.

18:52.969 --> 18:54.468
Wait, this is a tranquilizer gun?

18:54.520 --> 18:56.554
Of course, it is. We're Fish and Game.

18:57.890 --> 18:59.223
Ow!

18:59.225 --> 19:00.941
This is way lighter than a real gun.

19:00.977 --> 19:02.560
Ah!

19:08.284 --> 19:10.234
It's going to take more than one dart

19:10.286 --> 19:12.236
to stop the likes of Helmet Frontbut.

19:13.573 --> 19:15.206
That should do it.

19:15.241 --> 19:16.907
Got my heart.

19:24.333 --> 19:27.968
You're going down.

19:28.004 --> 19:30.471
Nein.

19:30.506 --> 19:36.427
You have the right to remain... sleepy.

19:36.479 --> 19:38.512
You...

19:38.564 --> 19:45.486
Will never take me... awake.

19:48.775 --> 19:54.361
Helmet Frontbut, you're under arrest for...

20:04.123 --> 20:06.340
Terrific work, Tribeca.

20:06.375 --> 20:08.542
If you want, I could put in a
word for you at Fish and Game.

20:08.594 --> 20:10.461
No, thanks. I'm good here.

20:10.513 --> 20:12.046
I guess this is goodbye, then.

20:12.098 --> 20:13.297
I guess it is.

20:14.517 --> 20:16.550
Whoa. I'm... I'm sorry, I...

20:16.602 --> 20:18.769
I must have misread this.

20:18.805 --> 20:20.137
That's okay.

20:20.189 --> 20:21.472
Okay. See ya.

20:21.524 --> 20:24.058
All right. Hey.

20:24.110 --> 20:25.643
I get it. I totally get it.

20:27.563 --> 20:29.146
Okay. Take care.

20:29.198 --> 20:30.648
You, too.

20:30.700 --> 20:32.533
No. All right, I'll see ya.
