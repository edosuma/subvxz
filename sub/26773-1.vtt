01:28.839 --> 01:30.716
Your destination is on your right.

01:30.800 --> 01:33.052
- Pretty sweet GPS unit though, there. I like the voice.

01:33.135 --> 01:34.220
Sounds kinda angry, though.

01:34.470 --> 01:35.679
- Are we here?

01:35.763 --> 01:36.555
- We're here.

01:37.139 --> 01:38.265
- What's the time?

01:38.432 --> 01:39.600
- Eleven fifty-three.

01:39.683 --> 01:40.643
- Did I win?

01:40.851 --> 01:41.936
- Yeah, what'd you say?

01:42.019 --> 01:42.895
- Eleven forty-seven.

01:42.978 --> 01:44.146
- I said twelve-oh-five.

01:44.230 --> 01:45.147
- Devon?

01:45.356 --> 01:46.982
- I don't remember, man. I'm probably way off.

01:47.775 --> 01:49.068
Boo-yah!

01:49.151 --> 01:50.486
That is a boo-yah!

01:50.569 --> 01:52.071
- Not so fast. We're not here yet.

01:52.154 --> 01:53.614
- What? How long is the driveway?

01:53.739 --> 01:55.115
- Hey, Miles. Drive slow.

01:55.282 --> 01:56.534
- No, don't do that. No!

01:56.992 --> 01:58.953
Heavier on the gas pedal.

02:00.830 --> 02:02.206
No, I'm still winning! Go!

02:02.498 --> 02:04.500
- What the hell's he doing?
- Are we lost?

02:05.459 --> 02:06.585
- No, this is it.

02:06.794 --> 02:08.628
Ahh! We're so close!

02:08.753 --> 02:10.673
- I think I win, actually.
- I don't think we can get there.

02:10.756 --> 02:12.758
- Well this is your property, so I think I win.

02:12.842 --> 02:14.760
I think that's how that's gonna work out.

02:15.177 --> 02:16.929
I think the jury will agree with me.

03:20.951 --> 03:22.870
- Miles, do you care where we sleep?

03:23.329 --> 03:24.830
- Oh, hold on! Everyone!

03:25.456 --> 03:26.665
One rule this weekend.

03:27.124 --> 03:28.751
Have fun. Have a blast.

03:29.251 --> 03:31.170
We're here to celebrate. Make yourselves at home.

03:31.253 --> 03:33.213
Let's make this a great fourth, okay?

03:33.547 --> 03:35.049
All right.

03:35.382 --> 03:37.343
- Are there gonna be enough beds for everybody here?

03:37.718 --> 03:39.720
- We'll make it work. Guest cabin sleeps six.

03:40.763 --> 03:42.681
- Let's not go to the guest cabin.

03:45.267 --> 03:47.019
- I like your pants, though.
- Thank you.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.104
Did you notice how the stripes match my shirt?

03:50.606 --> 03:51.941
- Sup.
- Hey, guys.

03:53.442 --> 03:54.652
- What's in the bag?

03:55.110 --> 03:57.279
- Four kilos of coke. I thought I'd share.

04:00.074 --> 04:02.159
- Really? 'Cause, those look way more like fireworks, dude.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.953
- You, uh... you do coke?

04:04.328 --> 04:05.371
- No.

04:06.705 --> 04:08.082
- There she is!

04:08.666 --> 04:09.750
- But he does.

04:09.875 --> 04:11.877
- All right. That... is a flag.

04:13.671 --> 04:15.381
- Guys, this stuff works great.

04:20.469 --> 04:23.263
- There it is. We got it. We got it!

04:31.230 --> 04:32.064
- Hey!

04:32.147 --> 04:34.066
Is anyone able to get a signal up here?

04:34.900 --> 04:36.402
- No.
- Nope.

04:36.610 --> 04:37.903
- What's going on?

04:38.028 --> 04:39.113
- Phone's down.

04:39.196 --> 04:41.615
Now I gotta go into Webster to call
the phone company. It's just a pain.

04:41.699 --> 04:42.908
- Yeah. C'mon, Gus, go!

04:42.992 --> 04:43.993
- You going for a run?

04:44.076 --> 04:44.868
- Yeah!

04:44.952 --> 04:46.495
- Go to Webster for me!

05:02.720 --> 05:03.929
- Don't get scared!

05:08.726 --> 05:10.728
- Hey, Miles! The guest cabin's locked!

05:11.228 --> 05:12.980
- Yep, I'm taking care of that right now.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.649
- Yeah, make us wait outside on this gorgeous day!
- No kidding!

05:17.401 --> 05:19.403
Yeah! What's up with that!

06:29.973 --> 06:31.058
- Hey, Miles!

06:31.141 --> 06:32.226
- Shit!

06:33.477 --> 06:34.770
- God damn it, Rob!

06:34.853 --> 06:36.688
- Shit, man. I scare you a little bit?

06:36.772 --> 06:37.940
Sorry, man.

06:38.023 --> 06:38.857
- Stay right there.

06:38.941 --> 06:40.150
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

06:40.651 --> 06:41.944
I'm here to help, dude, hey!

06:42.027 --> 06:43.612
Heard you need to make a phone call.

06:43.987 --> 06:45.739
- There's only a couple carriers that work up here.

06:45.823 --> 06:46.949
- Yep, mine's one of them.

06:46.949 --> 06:49.076
I made a phone call.
It was like just a couple miles from here.

06:49.201 --> 06:50.285
- Really?

06:54.665 --> 06:56.333
- Well, what's the status, man?

06:56.500 --> 06:58.043
- They're sending someone tomorrow.

06:58.293 --> 06:59.336
- All right.

07:01.088 --> 07:03.006
It's like the deep woods back here.

07:31.160 --> 07:33.120
What is it, boy? What's wrong?

07:33.203 --> 07:35.164
Come here. Come here. What is it?

07:42.838 --> 07:44.047
Hey!

07:44.131 --> 07:45.883
What are you guys doing back there?

07:46.008 --> 07:47.384
- We're just on a little adventure.

07:47.509 --> 07:49.511
- Adam! Is that you, you little son of a bitch?

07:49.595 --> 07:50.345
- Hey.

07:51.805 --> 07:52.681
- What the hell, dude.

07:52.764 --> 07:53.640
- When'd you get here?

07:53.724 --> 07:54.933
- Man, like thirty minutes ago, bro.

07:55.017 --> 07:55.934
- You drive straight through?

07:56.018 --> 07:57.853
- Hell, yeah. Looking forward to this shit all year.

07:59.062 --> 08:00.063
Whoo!

08:00.147 --> 08:01.440
That's right.

08:01.607 --> 08:03.942
You know it's every man's duty to get laid by good-looking chicks.

08:04.026 --> 08:05.861
I don't care if they're eighteen or eighty-one.

08:06.403 --> 08:08.405
- Well those girls are probably more like fourteen.

08:08.572 --> 08:10.532
- Fourteen. That gives us four years to make a plan.

08:10.616 --> 08:12.117
- You like that, Gus?

08:17.080 --> 08:18.040
- Gus!

08:18.999 --> 08:20.542
Gus! Come on!

08:21.084 --> 08:23.086
- The hell's wrong with that dog?
- Come here! Come here!

08:23.462 --> 08:24.796
Gus, come here!

08:24.880 --> 08:26.089
Just keep walking.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.633
He's all bark and no bite.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.259
- Sounds like me.

08:32.721 --> 08:34.722
[chatter}

08:50.155 --> 08:53.242
- Good sir! Requesting permission to pass!

08:53.659 --> 08:54.576
- Sorry.

08:55.327 --> 08:56.870
- Don't worry about it.

08:56.995 --> 08:58.830
Let's just not kill anyone this weekend.

09:00.499 --> 09:01.500
- Nice!

09:01.583 --> 09:04.086
What's this outfit here?
You preparing for the apocalypse or something?

09:04.169 --> 09:06.046
That's a bow and arrow. Don't see those every day.

09:07.005 --> 09:08.924
- Nice. That's it. That's it!

09:10.008 --> 09:11.301
Holy shit!

09:11.510 --> 09:12.970
Woops!

09:13.053 --> 09:14.888
- Sweet, man! Let me try that thing! Come on!

09:15.138 --> 09:16.139
- Let's see how this goes.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.725
- Show you how it's done.
You do know I'm an eighth Cherokee Indian, don't you?

09:18.809 --> 09:19.977
- Really?
- Yeah.

09:20.143 --> 09:20.852
- That's cool.

09:21.019 --> 09:22.479
- Yep. I mean Adam did tell you-

09:22.562 --> 09:23.897
- Oh, he's waving it!

09:24.147 --> 09:25.357
Everywhere.

09:27.025 --> 09:28.527
Woop.

09:30.153 --> 09:31.405
- I'll get it, dear.

09:31.905 --> 09:32.614
- Dear?

09:32.948 --> 09:34.950
- And you hold the string... yep.
- And then I go...

09:35.158 --> 09:36.618
Oh! Sorry, Devon!

09:36.785 --> 09:37.786
- Nice, Hinman.

09:41.790 --> 09:43.208
- Son of a bitch!

09:46.044 --> 09:47.879
- Woo-hoo! Had to be done, man.

09:48.046 --> 09:50.048
- Yep, in the crotch. Water.

09:53.010 --> 09:55.012
- So who's up for a little adventure?

09:58.432 --> 10:00.726
I think something just brushed up my leg!

10:00.809 --> 10:02.185
Are there big fish out here?

10:02.394 --> 10:03.895
- So... what do you do?

10:05.063 --> 10:05.731
- Drink.

10:05.814 --> 10:07.482
- God damn right. You got that right.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.027
Seems like you got your head on straight.

10:10.319 --> 10:12.237
- Seriously, what would you call someone who killed him?

10:12.779 --> 10:15.282
What would you call them? Beause it wouldn't be a bad thing, you know? Soâ€¦

10:15.365 --> 10:16.491
- Call what?

10:18.076 --> 10:18.952
- Excuse me?

10:19.578 --> 10:20.620
- Call what?

10:22.164 --> 10:23.707
- We're just talking about what you'd call somebody.

10:23.790 --> 10:26.335
- We're trying to figure out what you'd call someone who killed George Bush.

10:26.710 --> 10:28.962
Like if you killed Hitler it wouldn't be a bad thing.

10:29.588 --> 10:31.465
So... what would you call him?

10:31.882 --> 10:33.550
- Yeah, you'd call him a murderer.

10:33.842 --> 10:34.968
- No, the...

10:35.385 --> 10:36.970
- The person who kills him.

10:37.095 --> 10:38.597
- Right. The person who kills him.

10:38.722 --> 10:40.140
- Yeah. A son of a bitchin' murderer.

10:40.223 --> 10:41.266
Do I have to spell it for you?

10:41.683 --> 10:42.726
- Rob, stop it.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.145
- Who... who are you?

10:45.437 --> 10:46.188
- Who are you?

10:46.396 --> 10:48.398
- Yeah, like, what's your educational background?

10:48.523 --> 10:50.484
- Uh, a fuckin' unenlightened ignoramus

10:50.567 --> 10:52.402
doesn't know shit about nothin'.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.821
That sum it up for you clowns?

10:55.572 --> 10:57.240
- Yeah, actually.

10:57.616 --> 10:58.450
I think it does.

10:58.617 --> 10:59.993
- You know, where I'm from

11:00.077 --> 11:02.120
when you want to get to know somebody, you introduce yourself.

11:02.746 --> 11:03.914
I'm Robert M. Jones.

11:04.206 --> 11:05.415
Who the fuck are you?

11:05.499 --> 11:06.375
- Cool it, man.

11:06.583 --> 11:08.043
- I'm Chris. Yeah...

11:08.794 --> 11:10.837
- Happens to be a fuckin' holiday weekend out here.

11:11.254 --> 11:13.090
What you're saying, you know, you're being rude.

11:13.215 --> 11:15.717
- Well we can't ignore all the horrible shit our country does.

11:16.134 --> 11:17.969
I mean, just keep the blanket over your eyes.

11:18.095 --> 11:20.263
- You know, I bought these on the way up if anybody wants...

11:20.347 --> 11:22.516
Patriotic bandana.
- Hell, yeah. Damn right I do.

11:22.933 --> 11:23.892
- One for you.

11:24.101 --> 11:25.018
- Pass 'em out.

11:25.102 --> 11:26.353
- Two more? Anybody want?

11:26.436 --> 11:28.438
- Thanks. I don't really like what that thing represents right now.

11:29.481 --> 11:32.067
- Well it is our flag, I mean.
- It's fine, just take it. I don't care what you do with it.

11:32.275 --> 11:33.402
- Don't know if it...

11:34.403 --> 11:36.655
what it represents to other countries in the world right now.

11:36.863 --> 11:37.864
- What you think?

11:38.824 --> 11:39.783
- I think it looks...

11:39.908 --> 11:41.618
Fantastic. Looks great on you.
- It's tempting, yeah.

11:41.701 --> 11:44.204
- God damn it, sweetheart. You don't take one I'm gonna be offended, now.

11:45.831 --> 11:47.124
- He's gonna be offended!
- Yeah, big loss there.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.626
- You start talking about burning flags and stomping on flags...
- I neverâ€¦

11:49.709 --> 11:51.461
- â€¦and killing people this, and murdering that, yeah.

11:51.545 --> 11:53.171
- It's easy to be this ignorant if you...

11:53.588 --> 11:54.840
- Christ, Christ! Darlin'!

11:55.006 --> 11:57.134
Darlin', you got your head screwed onâ€¦
- Excuse me! My name is not Darlin'.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.094
My name is Libby!

11:59.761 --> 12:01.471
Woo-woo!

12:01.555 --> 12:04.391
We got ourselves a sensitive Miss Feminazi on the boat here.

12:04.474 --> 12:05.642
- Oh, come on, man!

12:05.725 --> 12:07.686
- Who uses the word Feminazi?
- You are a Feminazi!

12:07.769 --> 12:09.729
- Rush Limbaugh. He uses it. He probably coined the phrase.
- Hey, guys! Guys! Guys!

12:09.813 --> 12:12.524
Let's cool it, all right? I'm sick of hearing about this stuff!
- Can we go back?

12:12.607 --> 12:14.151
- He doesnâ€™t even know what it means.
- Feminazi.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.402
- Who uses that word?
- Shut up.

12:15.569 --> 12:18.113
- Turn around. Let's turn around. Let's ignore him. How about that?

12:18.738 --> 12:21.491
- Yeah, I'll cool it. I'll cool it all right.

12:28.832 --> 12:29.791
- Look out!

12:29.833 --> 12:31.042
- I will.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.086
- Ah, it's beautiful here.

12:33.211 --> 12:33.879
- Yeah.

12:36.256 --> 12:37.591
- How far should we go?

12:38.592 --> 12:39.801
- The farther the better.

12:52.939 --> 12:54.524
- Oh, a little treehouse!

12:55.484 --> 12:57.027
- That's a deer stand.

12:57.444 --> 12:58.904
- I didn't know Miles was a hunter.

12:59.529 --> 13:01.531
- Uh... he's... not.

13:04.159 --> 13:05.494
- I'm gonna climb up there.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.122
- Uh, I wouldn't do that, actually.

13:09.915 --> 13:10.832
- Why not?

13:11.041 --> 13:13.001
- Because you'll fall and crack your head open on a...

13:13.126 --> 13:14.628
- They're nailed in. They're good.

13:17.797 --> 13:18.757
Come with me.

13:21.927 --> 13:23.178
What was that?

13:25.514 --> 13:27.140
Is this still Miles's property?

13:28.350 --> 13:30.185
- Yeah, that's his deer stand.

13:39.736 --> 13:41.154
What?

13:46.618 --> 13:48.245
Hey, man. Hey.

13:48.328 --> 13:51.164
You got that jet-powered lighter on you? I saw you had it earlier.

13:51.248 --> 13:51.873
- Oh, yeah.

13:51.957 --> 13:53.375
- We're going out on the lake, we're gonna shoot some fireworks.

13:53.458 --> 13:54.209
- Shhh!

13:54.292 --> 13:55.710
- I got matches on me but, you know...

13:55.794 --> 13:56.962
I don't think it'd work too well.

13:57.504 --> 13:58.380
Appreciate it.

13:58.463 --> 14:00.715
- Yeah, and try to do the fireworks, you know, in the middle of the lake

14:00.799 --> 14:02.467
so you don't wake anybody up.

14:02.801 --> 14:04.553
- Yeah.
- Yeah, he's really concerned about that.

14:04.678 --> 14:05.512
- Hey you got everything?

14:05.595 --> 14:06.513
- Yeah, yeah.

14:08.974 --> 14:10.433
- All right, last chance.

14:10.517 --> 14:11.226
- Fuckin'...

14:11.351 --> 14:13.353
- Celebrate this great American holiday.

14:13.436 --> 14:14.604
Any takers?

14:15.397 --> 14:16.273
Hey, Robin Hood!

14:16.398 --> 14:16.898
- Yeah?

14:16.982 --> 14:17.941
- I know you wanna go.

14:18.066 --> 14:19.276
- I'm going over to the guest cabin.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.403
- All right, just the true patriots, then.

14:21.570 --> 14:23.405
- Yeah, minus the Amerinazis.

14:23.738 --> 14:25.115
Wouldn't have it any other way.

14:25.282 --> 14:26.032
- Yep.

14:26.116 --> 14:27.200
Shut the door!

14:27.284 --> 14:28.451
Idiot.

14:31.663 --> 14:33.331
- ...sugar and salt just sitting there?

14:33.748 --> 14:34.541
- I know what you mean.

14:35.166 --> 14:36.501
- I don't have time for this.
- OK, no it's a good hand.

14:36.585 --> 14:37.502
- Tell me what it is.

14:38.086 --> 14:38.962
- Straight.

14:39.087 --> 14:41.089
- A straight?
- Bullshit.

14:41.214 --> 14:42.340
Bullshit.

14:42.757 --> 14:44.259
- Show it, dude.

14:46.553 --> 14:48.763
- Oh, yes! That...
- That is... that is not a straight.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.348
- That...
- That's a boo-yah...

14:50.473 --> 14:52.434
- That's the money shot right there, buddy.

15:18.460 --> 15:20.462
- Whoops, hey!
- Yeah, I'll take that one.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.005
- Hey.
- Hey!

15:23.798 --> 15:25.383
- What's up?
- Hey, guy.

15:25.634 --> 15:27.427
- Bullshit, that's what's up, my friend.

15:27.594 --> 15:28.345
- Who's winning?

15:29.095 --> 15:30.513
- Bus. I'm a bus.

15:30.639 --> 15:32.682
- Well. That doesn't make sense because you need a B-U-L.

15:32.766 --> 15:34.768
- You're B-U-L, B-U, B...

15:34.851 --> 15:36.186
- Or B-O...

15:36.728 --> 15:38.021
- B-O?

15:38.271 --> 15:39.272
- B-O.

15:39.397 --> 15:40.023
- Whatever.

15:41.358 --> 15:42.901
- Had a few, then?

15:47.530 --> 15:49.115
- It was a leaf.

15:49.699 --> 15:51.326
- That was not a leaf.

15:53.078 --> 15:56.122
The one before that was maybe a leaf,
but that one was not a leaf.

15:56.456 --> 15:57.957
- Then it was a twig.

16:00.126 --> 16:02.128
- There was some rustling before it.

16:03.088 --> 16:05.090
- Everything's amplified in the woods.

16:05.340 --> 16:07.926
You can't listen to every little sound or you'll drive yourself crazy.

16:09.010 --> 16:09.719
- Yeah.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.806
- It was probably just some squirrel who had no idea he was scaring you.

16:12.931 --> 16:15.308
Or... maybe he was trying to scare you.

16:15.475 --> 16:18.645
In that case I'm tempted to welcome him in here.

16:26.778 --> 16:28.196
- Are there bears up here?

16:30.240 --> 16:32.242
- We would know if it was a bear.

16:34.077 --> 16:35.870
- But are there bears up here?

16:36.955 --> 16:38.456
- Probably. Sure.

16:41.459 --> 16:42.335
- Fuck.

16:44.170 --> 16:45.922
We have food in here.

16:50.385 --> 16:51.886
Let's get the food out of here.

16:53.888 --> 16:55.557
- We don't...
- Then I will relax.

17:03.940 --> 17:05.023
- Oh, shit.

17:09.319 --> 17:10.195
Shit.

17:11.948 --> 17:13.366
Jesus, what the fuck is that?

17:13.450 --> 17:14.367
Whooooo!

17:14.534 --> 17:15.492
- Holy shit!

17:15.827 --> 17:17.494
Come on, come on, come on!

17:18.246 --> 17:18.913
Oh, shit.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.001
Come on, come on, come on!

17:23.126 --> 17:23.877
Jump down!

17:28.089 --> 17:28.464
Come on!

17:28.798 --> 17:29.340
Hurry!

17:29.424 --> 17:30.592
Hurry, come on, come on, come on!

17:30.842 --> 17:31.760
Come on, get in, get in!

17:37.182 --> 17:38.016
What the hell is that?

17:38.099 --> 17:38.808
- I don't know.

17:40.769 --> 17:41.811
- That's a fucking bear.

17:41.895 --> 17:43.062
- It's not a bear.

17:47.859 --> 17:49.110
Woo-hoo! Look at them doubles!

17:49.152 --> 17:52.071
You see them doubles! Look at that! Boy, we could have a fight with these things!

17:53.072 --> 17:54.324
- We should get a band going.

17:54.574 --> 17:55.867
- Oh, really.
- No, seriously!

17:55.950 --> 17:57.994
And we get a bass player, drummer.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.037
I play guitar.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.371
You sing lead.

18:00.538 --> 18:01.873
Your song? Do you have the lyrics?

18:01.998 --> 18:02.665
- Yeah.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.000
Yeah, I guess I got a little...

18:05.251 --> 18:06.503
I guess I got a few, yeah.

18:06.669 --> 18:07.837
Hold on, just be quiet for a minute!

18:15.678 --> 18:17.680
Yeah, you know. It's got some words to it and shit.

18:18.640 --> 18:19.474
- Sing 'em.

18:20.892 --> 18:23.937
I can't tell you once again

18:25.188 --> 18:28.149
Where you been so lately

18:29.400 --> 18:31.569
I know what's going...

18:34.364 --> 18:35.281
- Flush.

18:36.533 --> 18:37.992
- A flush! Okay!

18:38.117 --> 18:39.327
Hey, can we play in the next hand?

18:40.870 --> 18:42.372
- Yeah, you wish you were here.

18:42.497 --> 18:44.499
I'm sure it takes a lot of skill.

18:45.667 --> 18:46.918
- All right, guys, I'll be right back.

18:47.085 --> 18:47.877
- Where you going?

18:48.044 --> 18:49.587
- You're just gonna make that statement and leave? That's...

18:49.712 --> 18:50.630
- Don't talk to me like that.

18:50.755 --> 18:52.757
- "I'll be right back." Mysterious.
- That's great.

18:53.258 --> 18:55.802
- There's too much testosterone at that table.

18:56.344 --> 18:58.346
Like, not a female-friendly table. No.

18:59.764 --> 19:00.557
- You turned in two...

19:00.640 --> 19:01.516
- Yeah.

19:02.559 --> 19:04.102
- So you have a flush...

19:05.311 --> 19:07.230
Whoa!

19:07.313 --> 19:08.523
Holy shit!

19:10.191 --> 19:11.317
Yessss!

19:11.568 --> 19:13.570
That's great. Who is that?

19:14.696 --> 19:15.655
- Oh, my God.

19:16.322 --> 19:17.574
- Oh, that's creepy.

19:31.254 --> 19:33.631
Lindsay, do you hear that?

19:47.228 --> 19:48.104
- Jesus.

19:48.980 --> 19:50.315
Lindsay. Wake up.

19:51.482 --> 19:53.484
- Them bunch of fools sound like they having some fun.

19:55.278 --> 19:56.821
Ahhh! Holy shit, guys! Oh, my God!

19:56.905 --> 19:58.281
Guys! Somebody call the cops!

20:17.926 --> 20:20.136
Lock the fucking doors! Where is everyone?

20:20.219 --> 20:22.138
Guys! Lock the fucking door!

20:22.221 --> 20:23.264
- Calm down.

20:23.348 --> 20:24.390
- Okay, no! Don't calm down!

20:24.474 --> 20:25.516
Oh my God!

20:26.059 --> 20:27.101
Holy shit!

20:28.061 --> 20:29.687
I don't fucking know!

20:37.987 --> 20:39.322
The other cabin!

20:39.405 --> 20:41.407
Yeah, the other cabin! Some guy broke in! They're all gone!

20:43.159 --> 20:44.869
- I don't fucking know!
- â€¦how does one personâ€¦

20:44.953 --> 20:46.913
- That's not what he said!
- Hey, what happened?

20:46.996 --> 20:48.831
- Well, what did he say?
- Who was in the other cabin?

20:48.915 --> 20:50.917
- Someoneâ€¦ attackedâ€¦
- Yes, they're all locked!

20:51.000 --> 20:53.002
- Devonâ€¦
- I think they're all locked! It's not my cabin, I have no idea if they're all locked!

20:53.086 --> 20:54.420
- Joe...
- Who was there?

20:54.504 --> 20:56.506
- Let him talk... we're all talking at the same time!
- Did you see anythingâ€¦

20:56.589 --> 20:58.591
- Did he have a gun?
- Chris...?

20:58.675 --> 21:00.677
- I didn't hear any gun... Brian, I don't know!

21:00.760 --> 21:02.762
I just got...
- He came over and he attacked the other cabin...

21:02.845 --> 21:04.847
- Joe, this just happened?
- People are dead?

21:04.931 --> 21:06.599
- Look, if this's just one guy, here...

21:06.683 --> 21:08.559
You can knife these guys with nothing, just...

21:08.768 --> 21:10.687
- Shut the shade! Shut the shade!
- Take a knife.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.188
- Take a knife?
- Take a knife!

22:12.457 --> 22:13.624
- Do you wanna come with me?

22:13.791 --> 22:15.668
- No. Babe, I'm sure it's fine.

22:16.919 --> 22:18.254
- That was a weird yell.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.131
- That's how people act when they're drunk.

22:20.548 --> 22:22.175
- I just wanna make sure everyone's okay.

22:22.258 --> 22:23.217
- I know you do.

22:24.594 --> 22:25.803
- So, you're staying here?

22:25.887 --> 22:27.889
- Yes, I'm staying here.

22:29.390 --> 22:30.725
I love you.
- I love you, too.

22:44.030 --> 22:45.448
- Guys, we've gotta get out of here!

22:45.531 --> 22:46.949
- Would you fucking hold on a minute?

22:47.033 --> 22:48.618
Pete and Lindsay are still out there, and-

22:48.701 --> 22:50.578
- Well, we're just gonna wait here?
- I canâ€™t get outâ€¦

22:50.661 --> 22:52.538
- Someone needs to go and get the police!
- Iâ€™m blocked in by Tinaâ€¦

22:52.622 --> 22:54.415
Whose car is that behind Pete's?

22:54.540 --> 22:55.458
- Uh...

22:56.209 --> 22:58.211
That's, uh, that's Rob's truck.

22:58.336 --> 22:59.629
- Chris, go over there.

22:59.754 --> 23:01.339
- Well, where's Rob?

23:01.881 --> 23:03.299
- Just play it from that top again...

23:03.382 --> 23:05.301
- Okay, here we go.
- One-two-three-four...

23:08.012 --> 23:10.014
It's like a big drumbeat. You hear it rumbling down underneath?

23:15.436 --> 23:18.356
Well Satan's my friend, I met him down on the street!

23:18.439 --> 23:19.440
- Yeah!

23:20.525 --> 23:21.943
- Fuck! I can't get reception.

23:22.527 --> 23:24.237
- Rob could. Is his phone here?

23:24.487 --> 23:26.405
- Hey, yeah, letâ€™s, everybody, letâ€™s find Robâ€™s stuff.

23:26.489 --> 23:27.907
His keys, his phone, hisâ€¦

23:27.990 --> 23:28.908
â€¦whatever, his jacket.

23:28.991 --> 23:30.576
- Or Tina. She's not blocked in either.

23:30.743 --> 23:32.662
- You guys, Tina was in the other cabin.
Her keys are probably with her.

23:32.745 --> 23:34.747
And Rob probably has his cell phone.
- We can't wait for them to get back.

23:35.581 --> 23:36.749
- Well, whose keys are these?

23:37.875 --> 23:39.043
- Those are Pete's.

23:39.335 --> 23:40.336
- He's blocked in.

23:40.586 --> 23:42.213
- No, that side of the driveway's open.

23:42.296 --> 23:43.673
- Oh, you think we can get out?

24:33.806 --> 24:35.850
Guys! It's Pete.

24:38.603 --> 24:39.562
- Get in, get in, get in!

24:39.645 --> 24:40.605
Jesus...

24:43.566 --> 24:44.817
Hey, where's Lindsay?
- Pete!

24:44.901 --> 24:45.985
- Sheâ€™s back at the tent. What?

24:46.027 --> 24:47.737
- Pete! We need your car. Okay?

24:47.945 --> 24:49.697
- Uh... wait. No. Brian, whereâ€¦

24:49.780 --> 24:51.574
- What's going on?
- This guy came and attacked the other cabin.

24:51.657 --> 24:53.242
He came in and he started...

24:53.326 --> 24:54.619
Killing people.

24:55.244 --> 24:55.995
Joe was there.

24:56.078 --> 24:57.580
- What! When!
- I donâ€™t know. Joe was there.

24:57.663 --> 24:59.040
Right now! Joe was thereâ€¦

24:59.123 --> 25:00.791
...and he's the only one who made it back.

25:02.627 --> 25:03.878
- I have to get to Lindsay.

25:03.961 --> 25:05.338
- What... what are you...?
- Wait!

25:05.671 --> 25:07.089
- Who's going with you?

25:08.174 --> 25:09.175
- Some... I don't fucking...

25:09.258 --> 25:10.301
- I'll go, I'll go! Iâ€™ll go with.

25:10.635 --> 25:11.969
- Fine, I'll go to. Here, take this.

25:12.053 --> 25:13.137
Does anybody else wanna go?

25:13.221 --> 25:13.721
- No.

25:13.804 --> 25:15.097
- If we're gonna do this we gotta do it right now.

25:15.181 --> 25:16.682
I think everyone else should stay here.

25:16.766 --> 25:18.476
We'll be safe until you guys get back.
- Come on!

25:24.232 --> 25:25.775
- Come on, come on, come on, come on...

25:28.861 --> 25:30.071
Go forward. Go forward.

25:31.906 --> 25:33.532
Brian, Jesus Christ, hurry up!

25:41.874 --> 25:43.459
- They're completely fucked if whoever hears that.

25:43.542 --> 25:44.877
- Well we need to get somebody out of here!

25:44.961 --> 25:46.087
- I can't believe they're doing it that way.

25:46.170 --> 25:47.088
- Look, we're gonna get back really soon.

25:47.171 --> 25:49.423
So just have somebody here at the door when we get back. All right?
- Come on! Letâ€™s go!

25:49.507 --> 25:50.466
- Just get Lindsay!

25:50.549 --> 25:52.093
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

25:52.843 --> 25:53.886
Okay, okay, okay...

25:54.262 --> 25:55.554
You're good, you're good, you're good...

25:56.514 --> 25:57.473
- Get in, get in!

26:27.712 --> 26:28.754
- Look out!

26:30.715 --> 26:31.424
Oh my God!

26:31.841 --> 26:32.800
What are we gonna do?

26:36.554 --> 26:38.097
- It's not that big.
- Brian!

26:38.306 --> 26:39.390
Oh my God!

26:40.766 --> 26:42.768
Oh my God oh my God oh my God oh my God...

26:46.105 --> 26:46.939
Brian!

26:47.440 --> 26:48.858
Oh my God! Come on!

26:56.532 --> 26:57.616
Shit!
- Dammit!

26:58.075 --> 26:58.909
- Okay.

27:20.681 --> 27:22.683
- Hey, babe. What was it?

27:29.357 --> 27:30.983
Pete?

27:33.861 --> 27:38.074
Lindsay! Stay where you are! We're coming!

28:41.846 --> 28:43.848
- Okay. Should we get out and move them?

28:44.432 --> 28:45.891
- No. We're fucking stuck!

28:45.975 --> 28:47.685
- Okay. Try reverse. Try reverse!

28:51.522 --> 28:52.440
- Come on!

28:53.441 --> 28:54.191
Come on!

29:02.658 --> 29:04.869
Ahh!

29:16.464 --> 29:17.882
We're gonna have to push. Come on.

29:20.593 --> 29:22.595
I'll drive, you push. I'll drive, you push. Okay.

29:26.307 --> 29:28.309
Okay, okay, okayâ€¦

29:30.936 --> 29:32.021
Okay, what are you doing?

29:32.104 --> 29:34.106
- We're gonna have to go in reverse. Okay?
- Okay.

29:34.565 --> 29:35.524
- Let's go. Ready?

29:35.608 --> 29:36.108
- Yeah.

29:36.192 --> 29:36.859
- Go!

29:38.569 --> 29:39.612
Go!

29:40.571 --> 29:42.573
Keep going, keep going!

29:44.074 --> 29:45.743
- Come on, come on, come on...

29:45.826 --> 29:46.702
- Stop!

29:46.785 --> 29:48.078
What? What!

29:48.162 --> 29:49.413
- You gotta go slowly!

29:49.413 --> 29:50.664
Let the wheels catch.
- Okay!

29:50.748 --> 29:52.416
- We have to get into a rhythm. Are you ready?

29:52.500 --> 29:53.250
- Okay. Yes!

29:53.334 --> 29:54.001
- Go!

29:59.131 --> 30:00.633
Stop! Are you fucking kidding me?

30:00.716 --> 30:01.300
- What!

30:01.383 --> 30:02.134
- Slow!

30:02.343 --> 30:04.345
Don't rev it! You gotta get some traction!

30:04.345 --> 30:06.096
- Okay! Letâ€™s go!
- Ready?

30:06.180 --> 30:06.847
Go!

30:09.642 --> 30:10.851
Come on!

30:11.977 --> 30:12.895
Again!

30:15.314 --> 30:15.981
Stop!

30:16.065 --> 30:17.149
- Okay.

30:17.233 --> 30:18.150
Fuck.

30:18.234 --> 30:19.193
- We have to go on foot.

30:19.527 --> 30:20.903
Get out of the fucking car.

30:20.986 --> 30:22.988
Katie! Get out of the fucking car! We gotta go!

30:26.909 --> 30:28.661
Come on! Get out of the fucking car!
- Okay, okay, okayâ€¦

30:28.827 --> 30:30.829
- Katie, come on! Come on! We have to go.

30:30.913 --> 30:32.915
Come on. Come on! I'm sorry. We have to run-

31:00.526 --> 31:01.402
- Fuck.

31:02.820 --> 31:03.904
- Pete, what...?

31:07.575 --> 31:08.784
Look, which way is it?

31:09.535 --> 31:11.370
- I don't even know what fucking direction I'm facing anymore.

31:12.663 --> 31:13.539
- Well...

31:15.374 --> 31:16.083
Well just...

31:16.166 --> 31:17.418
We have to pick a direction.

31:19.295 --> 31:20.879
- I think it's this way.
- All right.

32:19.521 --> 32:20.397
- God dammit!

32:20.731 --> 32:21.565
- You all right?

32:21.649 --> 32:22.816
- This is totally unfamiliar.

32:24.443 --> 32:26.153
- Okay. What now?

32:29.156 --> 32:30.032
Pete, what now!

32:30.115 --> 32:32.117
- Shhhh! Keep your fucking voice down! I don't know.

32:32.284 --> 32:34.286
- Hey, hey... This place is obviously wrong.

32:35.162 --> 32:36.830
We've gotta go back the way we came.

32:36.914 --> 32:37.748
Right?

32:37.831 --> 32:38.666
Let's go.

33:06.360 --> 33:07.528
- Pete?

33:17.037 --> 33:18.414
Oh my God...

33:31.385 --> 33:32.970
Oh my God...

33:50.487 --> 33:51.655
- See anything?

33:51.864 --> 33:54.825
- Couple sets of lights. Not sure if they're Adam and Rob, though.

33:55.534 --> 33:56.618
- Well keep checking.

33:56.869 --> 33:59.872
- They've been gone way too long. They should've found Lindsay by now.

34:14.344 --> 34:16.096
- Think they're dead?

34:20.768 --> 34:21.726
- Fuck!

34:22.311 --> 34:23.103
Fuck.

34:23.353 --> 34:24.855
- What are we gonna do?

34:35.449 --> 34:36.408
- Hey...

34:36.949 --> 34:37.951
What is that?

34:42.831 --> 34:44.833
- Oh, shit! No... no!

34:45.708 --> 34:46.918
No. Shit!

34:47.002 --> 34:47.753
Lindsay!

34:47.835 --> 34:48.504
Shit.

34:48.629 --> 34:49.420
Lindsay!

34:49.922 --> 34:50.672
Lindsay!

34:54.176 --> 34:54.967
She's not here.

34:55.052 --> 34:56.094
- Look, we should head back.

34:56.178 --> 34:56.969
- Lindsay!

34:59.223 --> 35:00.849
- Pete, she probably ran, man.

35:01.183 --> 35:02.226
- Let's just keep on going.

35:02.392 --> 35:04.019
- She's gottaâ€¦ sheâ€™s back at the cabin.

35:04.978 --> 35:06.271
- Lindsay!
- We should head back.

35:06.522 --> 35:07.981
- Pete?
- We can't see, man.

35:08.065 --> 35:09.149
We gotta get back.

35:10.526 --> 35:12.236
- You guys go back, then. Iâ€™m gonna keep going.

35:12.319 --> 35:13.278
- What, without a light?

35:15.113 --> 35:16.156
It's pitch black.

35:17.407 --> 35:18.075
- Oh, shit.

35:18.450 --> 35:19.284
The bear bag.

35:19.368 --> 35:21.161
- What?
- There's a flashlight in the bear bag!

35:21.245 --> 35:22.329
- Okay...
- Help me up!

35:22.412 --> 35:23.622
- Oh, shit! Be careful.

35:23.914 --> 35:25.916
- Oh, shit! Jesus â€¦ fuckâ€¦

35:26.875 --> 35:28.544
- All right... all right...

35:31.463 --> 35:32.506
Careful...

35:35.634 --> 35:37.344
Be careful, man! Shitâ€¦

35:46.520 --> 35:47.437
You got it?

35:47.521 --> 35:48.480
- Yeah.

35:56.947 --> 35:58.282
- See anything?

35:58.448 --> 35:59.241
- No.

36:09.668 --> 36:10.544
Oh, shit!

36:12.713 --> 36:13.839
Run!

36:15.215 --> 36:16.258
No!

36:16.383 --> 36:17.759
Eddie, run!

36:19.887 --> 36:21.179
No!

36:22.723 --> 36:23.599
No!

37:30.540 --> 37:32.542
Son of a bitch!

37:33.627 --> 37:34.836
- Adam and Rob?

37:37.547 --> 37:38.840
What the hell?

37:38.924 --> 37:40.050
- Jesus Christ!
- Hey!

37:40.133 --> 37:41.969
Fucking guitar, man, watch out!

37:42.886 --> 37:43.762
Fucking clown!

37:46.306 --> 37:47.641
- Hello?!
- Guys!

37:48.892 --> 37:50.352
- Maybe I need to...
- Anybody home?

37:51.311 --> 37:53.146
Why the fuck are the outside lights off?

37:53.230 --> 37:55.232
- I don't know. Let me light the way.

37:55.315 --> 37:57.401
Why are the outside lights off...

37:58.568 --> 37:59.528
Guys!

38:12.958 --> 38:14.960
- Oh my God...

38:18.672 --> 38:20.424
- Shit! Look, man, I might hit another one...

38:20.674 --> 38:22.676
- Guys! Guys! Guys!

38:23.343 --> 38:24.428
Shut up!

38:26.138 --> 38:27.097
- You shut up!

38:27.514 --> 38:28.932
- No, seriously, hurry and get in here!

38:29.016 --> 38:29.516
Now!

38:29.599 --> 38:31.226
- Hey! Wake up, assholes!

38:31.309 --> 38:32.394
- One! Two!

38:32.602 --> 38:33.854
Now!

38:34.396 --> 38:35.731
- One... three!

38:35.814 --> 38:37.024
Come on, Gus!

38:37.315 --> 38:38.817
- Come on, Gus.
- Come on, boy.

38:39.443 --> 38:40.068
- Get in.

38:40.986 --> 38:41.862
Shit! Christ!
- Rob! Fuckâ€¦

38:41.945 --> 38:43.321
- Get in, you fuckingâ€¦
- Get the fuckâ€¦

38:43.405 --> 38:45.198
Fucking son of a bitch!

38:45.407 --> 38:46.366
- Oh my God, are you okay?

38:47.242 --> 38:48.910
- The hell's it so dark in here for?

38:49.536 --> 38:51.371
You guys having a satanic ritual, or what?

38:52.080 --> 38:53.540
Well, I wouldn't put it past this guy.

38:53.874 --> 38:54.750
Hell, yeah.

38:55.083 --> 38:56.501
Better watch this guy right here.

38:56.877 --> 38:58.628
I'm sure he has plans to do something like that.

38:58.712 --> 38:59.755
- No! Turn the-

39:00.881 --> 39:02.257
- Why the fuck is the couch right here?

39:03.300 --> 39:04.092
- Off.

39:05.844 --> 39:07.429
What, is everybody asleep?

39:07.512 --> 39:09.514
- Jesus Christ. Just listen to me. People are dead.

39:09.973 --> 39:11.058
Yeah.

39:12.768 --> 39:13.769
- Wake 'em up!

39:14.144 --> 39:15.896
- Hey! Not everyone's a partier.

39:15.979 --> 39:17.355
You know that, Adam. Around here anyway.

39:17.439 --> 39:18.148
- Oh my God.

39:18.231 --> 39:19.357
- Where's the beer at around here?

39:19.441 --> 39:20.317
- I'm not... I'm not kidding.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.402
A guy just walked over there and started killing everybody.

39:22.486 --> 39:23.445
Kill what?

39:24.654 --> 39:26.656
- Killing the people in the cabin. They're dead.

39:29.743 --> 39:31.078
Six people are dead.

39:31.953 --> 39:32.788
Did you hear?

39:34.414 --> 39:35.040
- Yeah?

39:35.123 --> 39:35.874
- No, didâ€¦

39:35.957 --> 39:37.000
- Who cooked this fucking chicken?

39:37.084 --> 39:38.877
- People are dead in the other cabin!

39:38.960 --> 39:40.170
Okay, what are you talking about?

39:40.253 --> 39:41.421
- How do you know this?

39:41.505 --> 39:42.964
- If you don't believe me, go take a look.

39:43.048 --> 39:44.049
You're full of shit, dude.

39:44.132 --> 39:44.883
- No shit?

39:44.966 --> 39:45.967
- Yeah, no shit.

39:46.134 --> 39:47.469
- Like, when did this happen?

39:47.552 --> 39:49.554
- It just happened over there like an hour ago.

39:50.138 --> 39:52.140
A guy came into the other cabin and started killing people-

39:52.224 --> 39:53.725
- A... a guy?

39:53.892 --> 39:54.559
- Dude, what?

39:54.684 --> 39:55.936
- Where the fuck is he?

39:56.019 --> 39:57.437
Who came and killedâ€¦
- We donâ€™t know where he is!

39:57.521 --> 39:59.272
And can I ask why everybodyâ€™s, uhâ€¦

39:59.356 --> 40:01.316
...is hunkered down here like a bunch of pansies or something?

40:01.608 --> 40:04.653
Why don't we go kill this son of a bitch or something, weâ€™re talking about this.
- No. No oneâ€™s going anywhere because Katieâ€¦

40:04.736 --> 40:06.196
Weâ€™re not gonna go anywhere.

40:06.279 --> 40:08.115
Katie and Brian went to go get help.

40:08.198 --> 40:09.574
We're gonna wait here until it arrives.

40:09.658 --> 40:10.826
- Reallyâ€¦ you know what?

40:10.909 --> 40:12.869
If he comes at me, I know what I'm gonna do real fast.

40:13.161 --> 40:14.162
Knock his head off.

40:14.454 --> 40:16.373
- Rob. No. Donâ€™t be a hero.

40:16.665 --> 40:18.458
- There's five of us against one of him.

40:19.042 --> 40:19.960
- That's exactly right.

40:20.043 --> 40:21.962
And I saw this motherfucker shoot a bow-and-arrow earlier.

40:22.045 --> 40:22.879
- No, you guys are drunk!

40:22.963 --> 40:25.048
- Joe, you could stick a couple through his heart, right?

40:25.132 --> 40:26.299
- You're out of your minds.

40:26.383 --> 40:27.801
Just go have a beer.

40:29.094 --> 40:31.555
Go have another beer. Go have your seventeenth beer for the day.

43:17.304 --> 43:18.305
- Okay! Okay okay okay okayâ€¦

43:18.388 --> 43:19.389
No no no no no no...!

43:23.268 --> 43:24.144
- You guys!

43:24.394 --> 43:25.437
It's Lindsay!

43:29.899 --> 43:30.900
- Let me in!

43:30.984 --> 43:32.902
Jesus Christ! What the hell is it?

43:32.986 --> 43:34.321
- What happened? What did you see?

43:34.404 --> 43:35.780
- They're dead over there!

43:36.823 --> 43:38.825
I was all by myself!

43:39.492 --> 43:40.994
Oh my God, I thought everybody was gone!

43:41.077 --> 43:42.579
- Calm down. Shhh!

43:43.204 --> 43:44.748
Just tell us exactly what you saw.

43:44.831 --> 43:46.041
- Where's Pete?

43:46.875 --> 43:49.336
- He went looking for you, with Devon and Eddie.

43:50.295 --> 43:51.129
- When?

43:52.297 --> 43:53.590
- Half an hour, maybe.

43:55.091 --> 43:55.800
- Lindsay, listen...

43:55.884 --> 43:58.678
...we sent Brian and Katie in Pete's car to go get help.

43:58.762 --> 44:02.015
When they get back here with  the
police, weâ€™ll go find those guys.

44:02.098 --> 44:03.016
- Pete's car?

44:03.141 --> 44:05.060
- Yeah. We watched them drive down safely down the...

44:05.143 --> 44:07.228
- Pete's car is stuck in the driveway!

44:08.480 --> 44:10.815
- Are youâ€¦
- It's on these trees! Itâ€™s blocking the whole driveway!

44:12.317 --> 44:13.443
- What?
- Are you sure?

44:14.611 --> 44:16.112
- Did you see Brian and Katie?

44:21.201 --> 44:22.660
- Well... they might be fine.

44:22.744 --> 44:24.621
They all might still be fine. We don't know anything.

44:24.704 --> 44:26.373
- Except that nobody got to the police.

44:28.083 --> 44:28.875
- Uh...

44:28.958 --> 44:31.336
Well maybe we can take Rob's truck. Do you have your keys?

44:31.920 --> 44:33.129
- They're in the ignition.

44:33.213 --> 44:34.297
- You won't make it.

44:34.547 --> 44:35.799
It's completely blocked.

44:36.341 --> 44:38.343
The trees and the car
- youâ€™d have to move them both.

44:40.011 --> 44:41.221
- Fuck.

44:42.222 --> 44:43.264
- Chris.

44:43.973 --> 44:45.975
- Fuck, fuckâ€¦ Fuck!

44:46.684 --> 44:48.603
- Chris, it's okay. Donâ€™t worry about it.

44:48.686 --> 44:50.063
Don't worry about it?

44:50.563 --> 44:51.981
- We're gonna get out of here.

44:52.065 --> 44:54.317
- Don't worry about it. Yeah.
Because these guys are gonna help us get out?

44:54.401 --> 44:55.527
- No. We're gonna be fine.

44:55.610 --> 44:56.694
- We're not gonna be fine.

44:56.778 --> 44:57.570
- Chris!

44:57.654 --> 44:58.405
Fuck.

44:58.488 --> 44:59.364
- We're gonna be fine.

44:59.447 --> 45:01.449
- You just keep repeating that. We're gonna be fine.

45:01.533 --> 45:03.827
- You guys, they probably got out the car and walked by foot.

45:03.910 --> 45:05.578
They could be to a phone by now.

45:06.037 --> 45:07.705
Yeah, right.

45:10.625 --> 45:12.043
- Rob, where's your phone?

45:15.004 --> 45:16.089
- Chris, Rob's got a phone.

45:16.256 --> 45:17.215
- He's got a phone?

45:17.340 --> 45:18.299
- Rob's got a phone.

45:19.300 --> 45:20.760
- Does it work?
- Weâ€™re gonna call somebody.

45:20.844 --> 45:22.011
- Getting anything? Rob?
- You guys, call 911.

45:22.095 --> 45:23.054
- Nothing.

45:23.138 --> 45:24.848
- Call 911...
- Rob, are you getting anything?

45:24.931 --> 45:25.640
- Nothing.

45:25.723 --> 45:27.350
No service, man. Nothing.

45:27.434 --> 45:28.226
- Just keep trying.

45:28.309 --> 45:29.144
- Means no!

45:29.227 --> 45:29.894
Shit.

45:30.019 --> 45:31.396
- Well fuck, keep trying!

45:31.479 --> 45:33.690
- Look, I'll have to go across the road to get a signal.

45:33.898 --> 45:34.524
- No.

45:35.692 --> 45:36.943
- I need a bodyguard, man.

45:37.652 --> 45:38.611
- Rob, no...

45:38.695 --> 45:40.155
- Come on, Joe. You're with me.

45:40.280 --> 45:41.156
- Rob, stop!

45:41.364 --> 45:42.615
Listen to me. You can't go.

45:42.824 --> 45:43.741
- Can't go?

45:43.950 --> 45:45.952
What are you talking about? Sit around here and get killed?

45:46.035 --> 45:47.912
- Rob, Joeâ€¦ stayâ€¦ Listen to me... stay here.

45:48.079 --> 45:49.664
- Look, you guys can sit here and die.

45:49.747 --> 45:50.874
Break something...

45:50.957 --> 45:52.959
Run around with your hats on. I don't give a shit.

45:53.501 --> 45:54.878
Joe!
- Joe, stay here!

45:54.961 --> 45:55.670
- You ready?
- Yeah.

45:55.753 --> 45:56.838
- Are you ready?!

46:04.179 --> 46:05.138
- Rob... Rob!

46:05.889 --> 46:06.639
What?

46:06.723 --> 46:08.141
The motion light. Over the edge.

46:16.065 --> 46:17.775
Let's get out of the open. Go through these woods.

46:18.151 --> 46:20.153
No no no no way, man. No way.

46:20.695 --> 46:21.446
Straight ahead.

46:22.697 --> 46:23.531
Now, Joe!

46:35.502 --> 46:37.504
Now, now, Joe...

47:15.792 --> 47:16.709
Clearing.

47:31.975 --> 47:32.850
Right here.

47:35.103 --> 47:36.479
- Turn your flashlight off.

47:37.021 --> 47:38.106
- Shit.
- Back.

47:38.189 --> 47:39.732
911. What is your emergency?

47:39.816 --> 47:40.650
- Hello?

47:41.276 --> 47:42.443
Wisconsin.

47:43.903 --> 47:45.655
Sand Lake, Wisconsin.

47:46.823 --> 47:48.324
Uh, shit! The city, uhâ€¦

47:49.075 --> 47:50.451
I don't... the cityâ€¦ fuckâ€¦

47:50.535 --> 47:51.744
I don't know the city.

47:51.869 --> 47:53.663
It's a major fucking emergency, man!

47:54.789 --> 47:57.292
I said it's a major fucking emergency! God dammit, I don't know!

48:01.796 --> 48:03.464
Fuck... Thompson Road.

48:05.925 --> 48:06.843
Shit.

48:06.968 --> 48:08.428
Thompson Road! It's...

48:12.765 --> 48:13.850
You son of a bitch.

48:14.350 --> 48:16.144
- No good?
- Lost it, man. Fucking lost it.

48:16.603 --> 48:18.229
Fuck, dude. I'm sorry I got us into this shit.

48:18.313 --> 48:19.022
- Get down!

48:56.517 --> 48:57.226
Stop!

49:03.066 --> 49:04.150
Take him.

49:06.944 --> 49:08.279
Take him, Joe.

49:23.127 --> 49:24.045
Shit!

49:44.399 --> 49:45.274
Shit!

49:49.904 --> 49:51.739
Give me one of those throwers. Now!

49:58.079 --> 49:59.789
- How long have they been gone?

50:00.707 --> 50:01.666
- I don't know.

50:03.835 --> 50:05.002
- Twenty-three minutes.

50:06.170 --> 50:07.588
- What, are they going slow?

50:08.005 --> 50:09.382
- Rob doesn't know slow.

50:10.174 --> 50:11.551
- Yeah, but Joe's with him.

50:11.843 --> 50:13.845
Maybe they're just being cautious.

50:14.220 --> 50:16.222
Oh you son of a bitch! Keep on running!

50:16.848 --> 50:18.683
- Rob! Wait! Maybe we should stop!

50:22.729 --> 50:24.397
Rob, he's probably dead.

50:34.615 --> 50:36.117
Could he still be running?

50:38.953 --> 50:39.871
- Fuck.

50:40.621 --> 50:41.664
- What is it?

50:42.874 --> 50:44.292
- Man's not made of straw.

50:44.500 --> 50:45.710
Heâ€™s got a brain in his head.

51:21.537 --> 51:23.080
There are a lot of times deer-hunting...

51:23.414 --> 51:25.625
You can stick a deer good. I mean real good.

51:26.334 --> 51:28.252
Good blood trail. Then all of a sudden - BAM!

51:29.212 --> 51:30.129
Nothing.

51:30.713 --> 51:32.715
They make it to water. They can survive.

51:33.090 --> 51:34.717
At least improves their chances.

51:35.927 --> 51:37.136
- Got a signal?

51:48.356 --> 51:49.440
- Let's keep moving.

51:50.608 --> 51:51.609
Let's keep moving!

52:08.251 --> 52:09.252
Joseph.

52:11.212 --> 52:12.213
- I see it.

52:16.884 --> 52:17.760
Rob...

52:18.219 --> 52:19.095
Rob!

52:25.017 --> 52:25.852
Rob?

52:26.143 --> 52:26.853
- Yeah.

52:27.144 --> 52:27.979
Hey.

52:28.813 --> 52:30.231
Might have found something here.

52:44.912 --> 52:46.497
There a phone in here?

52:46.914 --> 52:48.040
- Hell if I know.

52:51.878 --> 52:53.880
They don't make 'em like this anymore.

52:55.423 --> 52:56.549
Taking this.

52:59.343 --> 53:00.553
- Oh, shit! Rob!

53:02.430 --> 53:04.098
- What?
- Look at that. Up there.

53:04.432 --> 53:06.100
- Maybe they got a line in there.

53:13.816 --> 53:14.984
Hello?

53:17.904 --> 53:18.738
Hello?

53:18.779 --> 53:19.989
There's a fire. Do you see anybody?

53:20.072 --> 53:20.823
- Hold up.

53:24.869 --> 53:25.995
- Hello?

53:26.078 --> 53:27.246
- Check it out.

53:32.293 --> 53:33.127
- Hello?

53:33.210 --> 53:34.587
- Hey! Take it easy. Take it easy.

53:34.712 --> 53:36.631
- Hello? Anyone here?

53:40.217 --> 53:41.469
Hello?

53:42.637 --> 53:44.639
- Hey, right there. Joe, Joeâ€¦ right there.

53:45.556 --> 53:46.766
There's a phone.
- Oh, yeah.

53:55.524 --> 53:56.984
911. What is your emergency?

53:57.068 --> 53:59.070
- I'm calling to report an emergency on Sand Lake.

54:00.237 --> 54:02.531
No, I don't know where Iâ€™m calling from. Please listen to me.

54:02.615 --> 54:03.741
People have been killed.

54:03.824 --> 54:05.785
At a cabin owned by Miles Crowe.

54:05.868 --> 54:07.453
It's on Thompson Road.

54:07.536 --> 54:08.704
No - I don't know who it is.

54:08.788 --> 54:10.373
We injured him but we can't find him.

54:12.583 --> 54:14.043
Yes. There are people still there.

54:14.126 --> 54:16.128
Yes, they are safe. They are inside the cabin.

54:17.296 --> 54:19.298
- What if they come back? What if they're not dead?

54:19.590 --> 54:20.383
- Are you kidding me?

54:20.466 --> 54:22.343
If they're still alive, they're doing the exact same thing that we're doing.

54:22.426 --> 54:24.136
How long is it gonna take to get that boat started?

54:24.220 --> 54:25.972
- Take me five seconds but we gotta get it untied.

54:26.055 --> 54:26.973
- The keyâ€™s down there?

54:27.056 --> 54:28.140
- Yeah, we left it down there.

54:28.224 --> 54:28.975
- Let's go.

54:29.225 --> 54:29.976
Come on.

54:30.101 --> 54:31.227
- Okay, we're doing this fast.

54:31.310 --> 54:32.019
- Okay.

55:05.720 --> 55:07.263
- Thank you. Okay.

55:14.562 --> 55:15.479
Rob?

55:20.609 --> 55:21.610
Rob?

55:25.281 --> 55:26.198
Rob?

55:26.949 --> 55:28.701
- So they're on their way?
- Yeah.

56:39.605 --> 56:40.856
Rob!

56:56.956 --> 56:58.958
- Did you guys drink all this beer?

57:34.910 --> 57:36.704
Fuck!

57:36.787 --> 57:38.038
- Cut! You all right?

57:38.205 --> 57:38.747
- Yeah.

57:38.831 --> 57:39.707
- You roll your ankle?

57:39.790 --> 57:41.709
- My forearm slammed into the cement here.

57:42.293 --> 57:43.919
I can't... see real well.

57:54.221 --> 57:55.222
- You okay?

57:55.389 --> 57:57.391
- Yeah, I'm fine. Start over.

58:02.897 --> 58:04.190
- No no no! Stop!

58:05.316 --> 58:06.358
- Shit!

58:50.194 --> 58:51.654
- Yoo-hoo! It's burning my pants!

58:53.239 --> 58:54.865
How you like me now?

58:59.245 --> 59:00.287
- Get some drums.

59:08.587 --> 59:09.338
- Yup

59:10.631 --> 59:11.757
Better up.

59:13.676 --> 59:14.969
If I can keep it up.

59:26.188 --> 59:28.190
- You know what would be better there, though, likeâ€¦

59:28.274 --> 59:30.234
A bass solo. Rather than guitar.

59:30.526 --> 59:32.653
- All right. Leave that out. Go! Roll! One!

59:44.999 --> 59:46.166
Drink a beer!

59:46.375 --> 59:47.084
- Yep.

59:47.710 --> 59:48.544
That was good.
