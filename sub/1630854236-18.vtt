00:44.620 --> 00:45.586
Come on, come on.

00:47.344 --> 00:49.896
You don't want none of this. You
don't want none of this, bro.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.103
- Keep going.
- No!

00:53.793 --> 00:55.551
Come on.

00:57.241 --> 00:59.000

Hey!

01:16.241 --> 01:17.620
You can't do that.

01:17.724 --> 01:19.068
You want some cheese
with that wine?

01:19.172 --> 01:21.172
Guys! Come on!

01:21.275 --> 01:23.068
No. Hold up. That's not fair!

Whoo!

01:30.551 --> 01:31.931
Ha, too slow, suckers.

01:32.034 --> 01:34.655
- The Stetson is mine.
- Okay, what's going on here?

01:34.758 --> 01:36.482
Did you run track in high school
or something?

01:36.586 --> 01:39.206
Are you accusing me of being
some sort of ringer, Walker?

01:39.310 --> 01:41.034
I'm accusing you of being fast.

01:41.137 --> 01:42.689
'Cause I was on Mathletes.

01:43.344 --> 01:46.172
Dad, you should really start
focusing more on cardio.

01:47.103 --> 01:48.241
Or you could just cut out
the junk food.

01:48.344 --> 01:49.482
All right, thanks.

01:49.586 --> 01:50.793
Oh, so this is what we get

01:50.896 --> 01:53.137
- for finally inviting you, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

01:53.241 --> 01:54.896
Hey, Dad,
Captain James is inside,

01:55.000 --> 01:58.172
says there's, like,
a seating chart emergency, so...

01:58.275 --> 02:01.137
All right, I'm on it.
Uh... I got to shower.

02:01.241 --> 02:03.448
- Yes, you do. [laughs] Yeah.
- Nice run.

02:03.551 --> 02:05.965
Ranger Barnett, a word.

02:06.068 --> 02:08.379
Mrs. Walker, those for me?

02:08.482 --> 02:10.827
You wish. I promised Kelly

02:10.931 --> 02:13.137
a spectacular wedding bouquet,
and I aim to please.

02:13.241 --> 02:16.344
I'm also in charge
of RSVPs and catering.

02:16.448 --> 02:19.034
Okay, so I s-- I-I see
where you're going with this.

02:19.137 --> 02:21.034
I bet you do.

02:21.137 --> 02:22.137
His wedding is tomorrow.

02:22.241 --> 02:23.586
I know, I know.

02:23.689 --> 02:25.137
And pretty much everyone
is bringing a plus-one.

02:25.241 --> 02:26.965
Well, except for Cassie,
but she's got a pass

02:27.068 --> 02:28.241
since her last boyfriend

02:28.344 --> 02:30.689
turned out to be
a homicidal anarchist.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.517
Well, I was planning
to ask Lana,

02:33.620 --> 02:36.758
the woman that I met when I was
undercover with those...

02:36.862 --> 02:39.241
homicidal anarchists.

02:39.344 --> 02:41.448
But bringing her
to Cap's wedding is

02:41.551 --> 02:43.310
obviously a horrible idea.

02:43.413 --> 02:45.344
I mean, the optics
of that alone, it's just...

02:45.448 --> 02:48.310
- Right, optics.
- Yeah.

02:48.413 --> 02:51.620
Look, Trey, okay,
you're basically family,

02:51.724 --> 02:53.482
so I am just gonna
come straight out with it:

02:53.586 --> 02:54.862
You have had a tough year.

02:54.965 --> 02:57.758
I've seen it,
and so has everyone else,

02:57.862 --> 03:01.310
but I've also seen how well
you've handled everything,

03:01.413 --> 03:04.413
and how much good
you're doing as a Ranger.

03:04.517 --> 03:07.137
But, at some point, you have
to do good for yourself.

03:07.241 --> 03:08.862
You deserve to be happy.

03:08.965 --> 03:11.724
And you deserve someone
who makes you happy.

03:15.862 --> 03:18.724
- Okay. Oh, my gosh, you won.
- Mm-hmm.

03:18.827 --> 03:22.413
You better get up and help me.

03:25.413 --> 03:26.586
That finishes off six.

03:26.689 --> 03:28.034
Yeah, I know,
I'm fine with table six.

03:28.137 --> 03:30.482
I'm talking about seven.
You put my cousin Janet

03:30.586 --> 03:32.000
at the same table
as my Aunt Lisi.

03:32.103 --> 03:33.827
- There will be blood.
- Okay. Not a problem.

03:33.931 --> 03:35.482
- Boys.
- Hi.

03:35.586 --> 03:38.275
Sorry to interrupt this
musical chairs, but work stuff.

03:38.379 --> 03:39.793
Hey, hey, hey.

03:39.896 --> 03:41.551
Hey, we all agreed no work stuff
until after the wedding.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.827
I know, I know, but I just
got a call from the FBI.

03:44.896 --> 03:45.965
Tessa Graves.

03:46.068 --> 03:47.724
Okay.

03:47.827 --> 03:49.793
Don't tell me the case against
Grey Flag is falling apart.

03:49.896 --> 03:52.206
Their case is in
great shape, actually.

03:52.310 --> 03:53.689
And Tessa said that

03:53.793 --> 03:55.655
us taking down Kevin
had a lot to do with that.

03:55.758 --> 03:59.448
Anyway, she's putting together
a Joint Task Force

03:59.551 --> 04:02.655
to go after a fentanyl ring
back east, and they need

04:02.758 --> 04:06.310
folks with experience working
big, complicated cases, like us.

04:06.413 --> 04:08.379
Hold up,
you're telling me the FBI

04:08.482 --> 04:09.724
is trying to poach
my two best Rangers

04:09.827 --> 04:11.137
without even calling me first?

04:11.241 --> 04:12.206
That's what you're telling me?

04:12.310 --> 04:13.620
Relax, Cap. It's not poaching.

04:13.724 --> 04:16.000
It's an eight-week operation.
July and August.

04:16.103 --> 04:17.655
So, if we did it,
we'd be back by September.

04:17.758 --> 04:20.310
Okay. What'd you tell her?

04:21.448 --> 04:22.724
That I was flattered,

04:22.827 --> 04:24.655
but I would need time to mull

04:24.758 --> 04:26.655
and speak to you, obviously.

04:27.655 --> 04:30.310
Uh, same here.
Flattered, very flattered.

04:30.413 --> 04:32.275
Honestly, right now,
before making

04:32.379 --> 04:33.931
any major life decisions,

04:34.034 --> 04:35.551
I feel like I got to do
some work on the seating chart,

04:35.655 --> 04:37.551
- so... Excuse me.
- Yes. Yes.

04:37.655 --> 04:39.689
- Hey, get Janet away from Lisi.
- I know.

04:39.793 --> 04:41.206
- Like opposite ends of the room.
- Okay, I got it.

04:41.310 --> 04:43.206
- Facing opposite directions.
- I got it. I'm on it.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.344
Cass.

04:47.137 --> 04:50.275
You can be straight with me.
Is this something you want?

04:51.379 --> 04:53.862
It's a great opportunity,

04:53.965 --> 04:55.551
but Austin

04:55.655 --> 04:57.000
finally feels like home.

04:57.103 --> 04:58.758
And I'm not sure I want
to spend my summer

04:58.862 --> 05:01.482
chasing drug dealers
in the Everglades with the FBI.

05:01.586 --> 05:04.103
Understood. But, hey,
for what it's worth,

05:04.206 --> 05:06.172
you would be perfect for it.

05:06.275 --> 05:09.379
Not that I want to lose you,
not even for eight weeks, but...

05:11.068 --> 05:13.344
Seriously, career-wise,
it could be a really good thing.

05:13.448 --> 05:15.206
Thanks, Cap.

05:15.310 --> 05:16.310
All right.

05:16.413 --> 05:17.827
All right.

05:18.689 --> 05:20.931
All right, Augie, where we at
with the bubble machine?

05:21.034 --> 05:22.275
Uh, what bubble machine?

05:22.379 --> 05:24.068
The one I asked you to rent
for the ceremony.

05:24.172 --> 05:25.413
Dad, we do not need bubbles.

05:25.517 --> 05:26.965
Yes, we do, Stella.

05:27.068 --> 05:28.620
They'll be festive. Look,

05:28.724 --> 05:30.517
I promised Kelly everything
would be perfect on the day.

05:30.620 --> 05:32.172
Why is everyone
ignoring my vision?

05:32.275 --> 05:33.275
Cordi, chill.

05:33.379 --> 05:34.620
Okay, we're doing our best.

05:34.724 --> 05:35.896
Everything's gonna
work out just fine.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.379
Okay, I think
your brother is just

05:37.482 --> 05:39.068
worried that
the old Walker curse

05:39.172 --> 05:40.448
is gonna ruin all our fun.

05:40.551 --> 05:41.862
Oh, there's no such thing
as a Walker curse.

05:41.965 --> 05:43.448
Uh, I could make a case.

05:43.551 --> 05:45.068
Remember Serrano
and the surveillance cameras?

05:45.172 --> 05:47.034
Okay, we could also
make a list of all

05:47.137 --> 05:48.827
the amazing things that
have happened at Walker Ranch,

05:48.931 --> 05:51.068
including, but not limited to,
Captain James' wedding.

05:51.172 --> 05:54.689
Uh, quick question, has anyone
checked the weather lately?

05:54.793 --> 05:56.482
They're expecting
freezing rain tonight

05:56.586 --> 05:57.655
and possible
flash floods tomorrow.

05:57.758 --> 05:59.034
You're kidding.

05:59.137 --> 06:01.551
You're not kidding.
She's not kidding.

06:01.655 --> 06:03.551
Okay, okay.
Time to pivot, people. Uh,

06:03.655 --> 06:04.896
ideas?
Yep.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.655
Postpone it a week.
We can't.

06:06.758 --> 06:08.068
James and Kelly
leave the next morning

06:08.172 --> 06:09.344
for their honeymoon,
same as you and Mama.

06:09.448 --> 06:11.724
Oh.
I-I have an idea.

06:11.827 --> 06:13.344
Why don't we go check out
the old hay barn

06:13.448 --> 06:14.413
that's next to
the covered arena?

06:14.517 --> 06:15.689
Okay, Liam,

06:15.793 --> 06:16.965
I don't have time for that.

06:17.068 --> 06:18.103
Okay, fine,
we will go and check.

06:19.068 --> 06:22.551
That place seems pretty idyllic
for a wedding.

06:31.586 --> 06:33.586
Well...

06:34.655 --> 06:37.068
"Idyllic" is one way
to describe it.

06:52.896 --> 06:54.310
Okay, well...

06:54.413 --> 06:55.965
what about The Side Step?
Can we fit everybody in there?

06:56.068 --> 06:58.689
Not without cutting
the guest list.

06:58.793 --> 07:00.586
Look, I know this is
gonna sound insane,

07:00.689 --> 07:03.000
but we're just gonna
have to make this work.

07:03.103 --> 07:04.758
Well, I guess
I could get the backhoe

07:04.862 --> 07:07.758
and move all the junk
to out back.

07:07.862 --> 07:09.724
Hm. Better idea is move it

07:09.827 --> 07:11.482
- straight into a dumpster.
- Mm.

07:11.586 --> 07:13.068
You know, we could repair
these beams

07:13.172 --> 07:15.655
and hang some lights from them,
maybe a disco ball.

07:15.758 --> 07:19.103
And we have leftover lumber
from the rescue stables,

07:19.206 --> 07:20.896
plenty of tools...
Yeah, well, now

07:21.000 --> 07:22.620
you're talking about
construction. What about a crew?

07:22.724 --> 07:26.034
Well, I've got the day off
and plenty of experience

07:26.137 --> 07:30.103
with catered gigs,
so put me to work, Coach.

07:30.206 --> 07:31.551
And not to brag,

07:31.655 --> 07:34.862
but I did get a B-minus
in shop class, so...

07:34.965 --> 07:36.413
Well, I suppose I could ask

07:36.517 --> 07:38.413
a couple of the ranch hands
for help.

07:38.517 --> 07:40.068
And Jim from DeMarco's,

07:40.172 --> 07:42.482
the feed store...
he owes me a favor.

07:42.586 --> 07:44.103
I thought he wanted
to murder you.

07:44.206 --> 07:46.482
He had a little legal dispute
with a local vendor

07:46.586 --> 07:49.310
that I might've helped him
out with, so now, he loves me.

07:49.413 --> 07:50.827
And I can text Ben.

07:50.931 --> 07:54.206
He has plenty of experience
working big events.

07:54.310 --> 07:56.000
This is gonna be great.

07:56.103 --> 07:59.310
Hey, teamwork
makes the dream work.

07:59.413 --> 08:01.965
Oh, my God, that is so cheesy.

08:06.310 --> 08:08.000
<i>How you doing over there, kiddo?</i>

08:08.103 --> 08:10.000
Good.
Okay, let me see it.

08:10.103 --> 08:12.482
Ah, let me, uh...

08:14.586 --> 08:16.517
All right.

08:16.620 --> 08:19.448
- Look at that.
- Thanks, Dad.

08:19.551 --> 08:22.206
- How do I look?
- Not too bad, buddy.

08:22.310 --> 08:24.896
Not bad at all.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.689
I mean, you know,
w-we can't have you

08:26.793 --> 08:27.965
showing up your old man, so

08:28.068 --> 08:29.275
let me just do
a little something.

08:29.379 --> 08:30.827
Hey, hey.

08:30.931 --> 08:32.758
- This took a while.
- All right. Let's get changed.

08:36.655 --> 08:38.068
Hey, Dad?

08:38.172 --> 08:39.517
- Yeah?
- Uh...

08:40.517 --> 08:44.172
Remember how you said that,
like, if I needed to talk...?

08:44.275 --> 08:46.827
Yeah. What's up?

08:46.931 --> 08:49.448
You know, I'm gonna be
a senior next year,

08:49.551 --> 08:51.448
- and I've been...
- Yeah.

08:51.551 --> 08:52.517
...really thinking
about my future.

08:52.620 --> 08:54.758
Yeah, I bet. Sure.

08:54.862 --> 08:56.758
And I actually might know
what I, what I want to do.

08:56.862 --> 08:59.517
Ah, okay, okay. Let me guess,

08:59.620 --> 09:01.620
you want to pursue music?

09:01.724 --> 09:03.103
I want to enlist in the army.

09:04.068 --> 09:05.965
I know the military
isn't exactly

09:06.068 --> 09:07.482
what you and mom had
in mind for me,

09:07.586 --> 09:09.275
and, to be honest, I never
thought I'd be interested

09:09.379 --> 09:11.000
in it, either, but, like...

09:11.103 --> 09:13.551
this year just kind of
changed that, you know?

09:16.862 --> 09:18.551
Look, Dad,
I've been flailing, all right?

09:18.655 --> 09:19.965
I-I've been looking

09:20.068 --> 09:21.310
for direction
and just a sense of purpose.

09:21.413 --> 09:23.344
And you feel like

09:23.448 --> 09:25.206
the military will give you that?

09:25.310 --> 09:26.586
Yeah, like what the Marines
did for you.

09:26.689 --> 09:28.275
- That was different.
- How?

09:28.379 --> 09:30.689
It...

09:30.793 --> 09:32.827
It just was.

09:34.965 --> 09:37.103
Well, Gramps thinks
it's a good idea.

09:39.275 --> 09:42.275
Y-You talked to my daddy
before you came to me?

09:42.379 --> 09:43.689
I-I e-mailed the recruiter,

09:43.793 --> 09:45.206
and he said I could start early.

09:45.310 --> 09:46.551
Like summer,
if I really wanted to.

09:46.655 --> 09:49.103
Augie...

09:49.206 --> 09:50.413
you're only 17.

09:50.517 --> 09:52.620
Yeah, I need your consent.

09:54.172 --> 09:55.068
Well...

09:55.172 --> 09:57.551
Uh...

09:57.655 --> 09:59.068
Wait. You know,

09:59.172 --> 10:02.137
I-I'm gonna need some time
to think about this.

10:02.241 --> 10:03.620
To-to really

10:03.724 --> 10:05.965
think about it, you know?

10:08.000 --> 10:10.689
But I promise you
I'll keep an open mind.

10:10.793 --> 10:14.586
Okay.
Guys, food's ready.

10:22.172 --> 10:24.586
I wasn't planning on
bringing this up today,

10:24.689 --> 10:26.034
on account of the wedding
and all,

10:26.137 --> 10:29.000
but it sort of feels like
the perfect moment, so...

10:29.103 --> 10:32.379
I decided to start college
in the fall.

10:32.482 --> 10:34.310
No. Yes.

10:34.413 --> 10:35.827
Seriously?

10:35.931 --> 10:38.172
Stella Blue, that's amazing.

10:38.275 --> 10:40.724
I'm-I'm proud of you.

10:40.827 --> 10:43.000
Wait, what about working
at the horse rescue?

10:43.103 --> 10:45.310
Oh, I can do both. I already
talked to Uncle Liam about it,

10:45.413 --> 10:46.448
and it won't be a problem.

10:46.551 --> 10:48.103
- That's cool, Stel.
- Yeah.

10:48.206 --> 10:49.241
Yeah, I was,

10:49.344 --> 10:50.448
I was, I was just
getting used to

10:50.551 --> 10:51.586
having you around.

10:51.689 --> 10:52.793
Kind of sucks that you're, uh,

10:52.896 --> 10:54.103
leaving for Sauber soon,
you know?

10:54.206 --> 10:56.896
I guess I sort of
buried the lede there.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.517
I'm sorry. I'm not moving
to Oregon State.

10:59.620 --> 11:02.000
- I enrolled at UCAS.
- No way.

11:02.103 --> 11:03.965
Wait, so you're, like,
you're staying in Austin?

11:04.068 --> 11:05.931
Yeah. I'm gonna get a place
downtown with Colton

11:06.034 --> 11:07.517
when he's back from Vegas. Wow.

11:07.620 --> 11:09.517
Can both of y'all just stop

11:09.620 --> 11:11.068
growing up so freaking fast?

11:11.172 --> 11:13.620
Please? Thank you. Uh...

11:13.724 --> 11:14.827
Sorry.

11:14.931 --> 11:18.724
Uh... W-W-Work thing.

11:18.827 --> 11:21.724
I-I got to take it,
but don't go anywhere.

11:21.827 --> 11:24.965
Uh, all right, sorry.

11:26.586 --> 11:27.965
This is Ranger Walker.

11:28.068 --> 11:29.206
Cordell.

11:29.310 --> 11:31.137
Detective Luna,
Corpus Christi P.D.

11:31.241 --> 11:32.655
<i>- WALKER [over phone]: Hey.</i>
- It's been a minute.

11:32.758 --> 11:35.137
David, yeah,
it's-it's been years.

11:35.241 --> 11:37.482
<i>Listen, I'm calling
with some news.</i>

11:37.586 --> 11:39.206
Hollis Miller just died.

11:41.620 --> 11:43.103
I see. Um...

11:43.206 --> 11:45.344
<i>I'm sorry to...</i>

11:45.448 --> 11:47.689
hear that.

11:47.793 --> 11:50.379
What was his,
uh, cause of death?

11:50.482 --> 11:51.551
He, uh, passed in his sleep.

11:51.655 --> 11:54.206
He... In his sleep?

11:55.206 --> 11:58.172
Kind of young guy
to just die in his sleep.

11:58.275 --> 12:00.689
Medical examiner
did a full autopsy,

12:00.793 --> 12:02.689
all right?
Says natural causes.

12:03.896 --> 12:06.931
Were his insulin levels normal?

12:09.310 --> 12:10.655
Yeah.

12:10.758 --> 12:13.275
Look, I see where you're going
with this, Walker.

12:13.379 --> 12:14.655
Believe me.

12:14.758 --> 12:17.000
I'm happy to say
his insulin levels were normal.

12:17.103 --> 12:19.034
Okay.

12:19.137 --> 12:21.931
Okay. Uh, well, um...

12:23.068 --> 12:25.310
Did they check for trace amounts
of digoxin?

12:25.413 --> 12:27.241
No, because that's not part
of the standard post-mortem,

12:27.344 --> 12:28.344
you know that.

12:29.517 --> 12:32.448
Yeah, okay, I-I need you
to ask your ME to do that.

12:32.551 --> 12:34.000
<i>Detective,</i>

12:34.103 --> 12:36.034
it's a simple test.

12:36.137 --> 12:38.137
Man, I called you as a courtesy.

12:39.586 --> 12:42.103
I don't want to go back
in time here, Walker.

12:42.206 --> 12:44.551
And I can't let you.
Emily would kill me.

12:44.655 --> 12:46.793
Emily passed.

12:47.965 --> 12:49.931
Damn, I'm sorry.

12:50.034 --> 12:52.379
Yeah, no. Me, too.
Thank you. Um...

12:53.862 --> 12:54.896
<i>I...</i>

12:55.000 --> 12:58.068
One test, as a favor.

12:58.862 --> 13:00.896
All right, Jim, coming down.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.448
Yeah, you got it.

13:02.551 --> 13:04.655
Good job. Take it easy.

13:04.758 --> 13:07.620
That beam should
work out just fine.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.172
So, this FBI thing...

13:17.275 --> 13:20.000
You'd be gone for how long?
[sighs] Eight weeks.

13:20.103 --> 13:22.689
So, it's kind of like
summer camp, but with guns

13:22.793 --> 13:24.310
and drug dealers.

13:24.413 --> 13:26.896
And an opportunity to take
your career to the next level.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.344
So you think I should do it?

13:30.827 --> 13:32.793
Just don't stay away forever.

13:33.965 --> 13:36.827
Oh. Needed that.

13:43.655 --> 13:46.482
Wait, what do you mean
you didn't get an invite?

13:46.586 --> 13:48.586
Oh, it's fine.
I'm not really offended.

13:48.689 --> 13:51.310
I don't really know
this Captain James guy.

13:51.413 --> 13:52.758
We still want you there.

13:52.862 --> 13:54.068
You know, it'll be fun,

13:54.172 --> 13:55.931
and you're already
helping out, so...

13:56.034 --> 13:57.103
Be my plus one.

13:57.206 --> 13:58.896
Colton's out of town, and

13:59.000 --> 14:00.689
I insist, so you really
don't have a choice.

14:00.793 --> 14:03.275
Well, if you insist.

14:03.379 --> 14:06.310
Stella, can I talk to you
for a second? Thanks.

14:08.206 --> 14:11.965
Listen, I was planning on asking
Sadie to be my plus one.

14:12.068 --> 14:14.482
Oh, Augie, please.
You're, like, still a child.

14:14.586 --> 14:16.655
You don't get a plus one.
Stella Blue,

14:16.758 --> 14:19.448
I need a fresh set of eyes
on this and be honest.

14:20.655 --> 14:22.655
Too many peonies?
Mawline,

14:22.758 --> 14:25.965
can you ever have too many
peonies? It's perfect.

14:26.068 --> 14:27.344
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

14:27.448 --> 14:29.862
'Cause I still feel like
it needs something.

14:32.344 --> 14:33.517
What about this?

14:33.620 --> 14:36.482
Oh, blue for luck.

14:36.586 --> 14:37.758
Well, now, see,

14:37.862 --> 14:39.586
what could possibly go wrong?

14:47.655 --> 14:49.034
Liam checked with Kelly,

14:49.137 --> 14:50.344
and she thinks it might be nice

14:50.448 --> 14:52.965
to do the whole ceremony
"in the round."

14:53.068 --> 14:56.000
Genius. Great. Let's do that.

14:56.103 --> 14:58.620
Okay, so then
if we've got these two,

14:58.724 --> 15:01.068
and if we...

15:02.793 --> 15:05.000
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:05.103 --> 15:06.241
You drove all the way
to my house to ask

15:06.344 --> 15:07.586
for my expert opinion

15:07.689 --> 15:09.965
on seating charts,
although I am admittedly

15:10.068 --> 15:11.827
no expert.

15:11.931 --> 15:13.379
You're barely paying attention.

15:13.482 --> 15:15.793
Uh... Yeah.

15:15.896 --> 15:17.241
Y-Yeah, yeah.

15:17.344 --> 15:19.310
Sorry. My-my mind has kind of

15:19.413 --> 15:22.448
been all over the place.
Um... Okay.

15:22.551 --> 15:24.965
Hey.

15:25.068 --> 15:27.413
- Hey.
- Can I ask you a question?

15:28.758 --> 15:30.344
Yeah, yeah. What's up?

15:30.448 --> 15:31.862
Okay, uh,

15:31.965 --> 15:34.517
didn't you just help
bring down a...

15:34.620 --> 15:38.172
an evil, terrorist
crime syndicate?

15:38.275 --> 15:41.172
I-If you're referring
to Grey Flag,

15:41.275 --> 15:44.137
uh, then... yes, ma'am.

15:45.689 --> 15:47.793
Yeah, yeah, it's been, uh,

15:47.896 --> 15:49.551
it's been quite the year.

15:49.655 --> 15:52.344
So why is wedding planning

15:52.448 --> 15:55.137
suddenly the thing that's
pushing you over the edge?

15:55.241 --> 15:56.827
You know...

15:56.931 --> 15:58.827
It's-it's my
best friend's wedding.

15:58.931 --> 16:01.137
I want everything to be perfect.

16:01.241 --> 16:03.586
- Okay. All right.
- Yeah.

16:03.689 --> 16:07.000
I mean, maybe that's-that's
part of it, but...

16:08.379 --> 16:10.206
You know, weddings,

16:10.310 --> 16:12.689
they-they do dredge up
all kinds of...

16:15.241 --> 16:17.000
I don't know. I guess
what I'm trying to say

16:17.103 --> 16:18.517
is that...

16:18.620 --> 16:20.379
this is gonna be the first
wedding that I've been to

16:20.482 --> 16:21.758
in...

16:21.862 --> 16:23.517
a really long time.

16:23.620 --> 16:26.413
- Since... Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah.

16:28.448 --> 16:29.551
Same.

17:28.241 --> 17:29.482
Please take your seats.

17:33.896 --> 17:35.551
Uh, welcome. Uh...

17:35.655 --> 17:38.482
I don't think I need this.

17:40.034 --> 17:42.172
Okay, uh...

17:42.275 --> 17:43.586
First off, I want to thank

17:43.689 --> 17:45.793
all y'all for being here

17:45.896 --> 17:47.896
and being a part of Kelly

17:48.000 --> 17:50.206
and Larry's epic love story.

17:50.310 --> 17:51.896
You know, hard to believe

17:52.000 --> 17:53.586
that, just about 24 hours ago,

17:53.689 --> 17:55.413
we were planning
on doing this thing outside.

17:56.551 --> 17:58.655
But by some miracle
and some hard work,

17:58.758 --> 18:02.586
uh, we were able to turn
this old barn into a chapel

18:02.689 --> 18:04.344
slash disco.

18:04.448 --> 18:06.241
Thank you guys.

18:06.344 --> 18:08.241
Thank you for that. Thank you.

18:08.344 --> 18:11.310
So, as I researched what exactly

18:11.413 --> 18:13.827
was required
of a wedding officiant,

18:13.931 --> 18:15.896
it-it became clear to me that,

18:16.000 --> 18:18.206
honestly, uh, not very much.

18:18.310 --> 18:19.862
Which is

18:19.965 --> 18:20.965
why I think

18:21.068 --> 18:23.137
Larry trusted me with it.

18:23.241 --> 18:24.448
That's true, that's true.

18:24.551 --> 18:25.965
Okay.

18:26.965 --> 18:28.793
My initial plan was to just
kind of stand up here

18:28.896 --> 18:29.931
and wax poetic

18:30.034 --> 18:31.448
about my best friend Larry

18:31.551 --> 18:32.965
and the love

18:33.068 --> 18:34.896
of his life, Kelly,

18:35.000 --> 18:36.172
and how

18:36.275 --> 18:37.724
the two came together

18:37.827 --> 18:40.137
again, they found each other
again. They found

18:40.241 --> 18:42.206
love again.

18:42.310 --> 18:45.172
How inspiring it was for me,

18:45.275 --> 18:47.724
for all of us to watch. Um,

18:47.827 --> 18:51.137
on a personal note,
I-I've known this man for

18:51.241 --> 18:53.275
a heck of a long time.

18:53.379 --> 18:55.448
- Long time.
- Uh, we started out

18:55.551 --> 18:57.379
as partners when I first
joined the Rangers

18:57.482 --> 19:00.793
and ended up becoming,
uh, brothers.

19:00.896 --> 19:03.103
Frankly, Kelly,

19:03.206 --> 19:04.965
I can see why you have
a difficult time

19:05.068 --> 19:06.172
keeping away from this guy.

19:10.620 --> 19:12.689
Right, yeah. Uh,

19:12.793 --> 19:14.344
Captain here has asked me
to keep things brief.

19:14.448 --> 19:16.448
Too late.

19:19.310 --> 19:21.172
All right.

19:21.275 --> 19:23.931
Let's cut to the chase, then.

19:30.482 --> 19:32.482
All right, here goes.

19:34.310 --> 19:37.206
Larry Samuel James,

19:37.310 --> 19:39.724
do you take Kelly Dana...

19:39.827 --> 19:42.172
James, uh...

19:44.413 --> 19:45.931
...as your lawfully wedded wife,

19:46.034 --> 19:47.586
to have and to hold,

19:47.689 --> 19:50.896
through sickness
and in health, again?

19:51.000 --> 19:53.275
I most certainly do.

19:57.586 --> 19:59.931
Kelly Dana James, do you

20:00.034 --> 20:03.620
take Larry Samuel James
as your lawfully wedded husband,

20:03.724 --> 20:06.689
to have and to hold,
through sickness and in health,

20:06.793 --> 20:07.862
again?

20:07.965 --> 20:09.793
Heck yeah, I do.

20:11.931 --> 20:13.965
Well, then,

20:14.068 --> 20:16.758
with the powers vested in by the

20:16.862 --> 20:19.793
"Unitarian online chapel"
or something...

20:23.586 --> 20:25.275
...uh... I now

20:25.379 --> 20:27.482
pronounce you husband and wife.

20:27.586 --> 20:29.724
You may kiss the bride.

20:41.068 --> 20:42.137
I love you.

I appreciate that.

23:38.517 --> 23:40.241
Oh, my Lord. Whew.

23:40.344 --> 23:42.034
Way to show them
how it's done, Gramps.

23:42.137 --> 23:44.793
Well, I am feeling
a little celebratory.

23:45.724 --> 23:47.000
I hear you're going back
to college.

23:47.103 --> 23:50.241
I don't know that
it's called "going back"

23:50.344 --> 23:52.965
when I technically never went.

23:53.068 --> 23:54.551
But it's local.

23:54.655 --> 23:57.034
Listen, you don't need to
explain yourself to me. I'm...

23:57.137 --> 23:58.448
I am proud of you.

23:58.551 --> 23:59.965
Thank you.

24:00.068 --> 24:01.689
I just...

24:01.793 --> 24:04.586
I want to educate myself
to do more.

24:04.689 --> 24:06.034
Now that's smart.

24:06.137 --> 24:08.068
As long as it leaves you
time to dance.

24:09.517 --> 24:11.965
All right, let's dance,
little girl.

24:17.137 --> 24:19.000
Cordi.

24:19.103 --> 24:21.068
- Cap. Man of the hour.
- Whew. I got to tell you, man,

24:21.172 --> 24:23.965
Kelly was worried.
She couldn't help out

24:24.068 --> 24:25.310
with the planning
'cause of her work schedule,

24:25.413 --> 24:28.000
but you actually pulled it off.

24:28.103 --> 24:31.206
Yeah. Yeah, I pulled it off.
What, you doubted me?

24:31.310 --> 24:32.482
I absolutely did.

24:32.586 --> 24:33.965
Heard a thing or two about

24:34.068 --> 24:36.000
- the state of this barn.
- Well, but look at it now.

24:36.103 --> 24:37.448
Come on. Hey, hey,

24:37.551 --> 24:39.379
- look at us now.
- Yeah, man.

24:39.482 --> 24:41.000
It's been a long road,

24:41.103 --> 24:44.655
and I am glad to still
be on it with you, my brother.

24:45.448 --> 24:47.551
Me, too. Yeah.

24:48.689 --> 24:51.758
- Mm.
- Yeah, uh, um...

24:51.862 --> 24:54.137
I got a call
from Detective Luna.

24:54.241 --> 24:56.206
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

24:56.310 --> 24:58.344
Hollis Miller died,

24:58.448 --> 25:01.000
and I asked Luna

25:01.103 --> 25:02.413
to have the ME

25:02.517 --> 25:04.793
check for digoxin.

25:11.275 --> 25:13.724
- Okay, hold up, hold up.
- J-J-Just in case, just in case.

25:13.827 --> 25:15.655
Okay? A-And I've been

25:15.758 --> 25:18.413
- overthinking things lately.
- Cordi.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.068
I can't go back there.

25:20.172 --> 25:21.965
You know what that case
did to me.

25:22.068 --> 25:24.068
You know what that case did to
me and Kelly. There is no way...

25:24.172 --> 25:26.965
I know, and I-I wouldn't
have even brought it up,

25:27.068 --> 25:28.827
especially today,
if it weren't for the fact

25:28.931 --> 25:30.310
that I-I just want to be
completely transparent

25:30.413 --> 25:33.034
with you, especially after
these past few months.

25:35.655 --> 25:37.241

I woke up,

unmarried women

26:57.000 --> 26:59.034
actually used to basically
attack the bride

26:59.137 --> 27:01.379
and tear off little pieces
of her dress for good luck?

27:01.482 --> 27:03.000
Until, at some point,
she was just like,

27:03.103 --> 27:05.241
"You know what,
take these flowers

27:05.344 --> 27:07.931
and please stop

30:47.551 --> 30:49.068
But, between you and me,

30:49.172 --> 30:52.620
it might be for more
than just a summer.

30:52.724 --> 30:55.137
So, that's the tricky part.

30:55.241 --> 30:57.724

giving me the hard sell.

to the feds?

31:00.413 --> 31:03.413
No. You know how I feel
about those guys.

31:05.482 --> 31:06.793
But I...

31:07.931 --> 31:10.137
Forget I said anything.

31:10.241 --> 31:12.413

about something like that.

31:18.034 --> 31:19.206

what I said earlier,

31:19.310 --> 31:21.000
about this being home now?

31:22.000 --> 31:24.241
A lot of that is because of you.

31:27.241 --> 31:28.413

31:29.551 --> 31:31.758
And the same for me, too.

31:31.862 --> 31:34.206
Maybe that's why
our fight and...

31:34.310 --> 31:37.310
everything after Grey Flag,
it just hit me so hard.

31:38.379 --> 31:40.758
I wouldn't really call that
a fight, it was more just us

31:40.862 --> 31:43.206

some hard truths.

31:44.241 --> 31:47.517

- while we got a chance.
- Uh... Okay.

32:26.310 --> 32:29.793
- Um, please, sit. Uh...
- Yeah.

32:29.896 --> 32:31.137
Um...

32:31.241 --> 32:33.206
I want to tell you

32:33.310 --> 32:35.310
how proud I am of you.

32:35.413 --> 32:39.275
Not just for how you helped
make today happen,

32:39.379 --> 32:42.137
but how you've changed course
this past year

32:42.241 --> 32:44.344
for the better,
how you've grown.

32:44.448 --> 32:48.241
Now, you were a little lost, and
I get that because I was, too.

32:49.206 --> 32:51.241
Okay, so you've, uh,

32:51.344 --> 32:53.206
thought about what I said,
about the army?

32:53.310 --> 32:57.241
I've thought about it
a lot, yeah.

32:59.551 --> 33:02.689
And...

33:02.793 --> 33:04.931
I don't think it's time.

33:06.275 --> 33:08.931
Oh, okay, but, like,
everything you're saying

33:09.034 --> 33:11.413
about how I've grown,
doesn't that

33:11.517 --> 33:13.413
indicate that it's, like,
the perfect time?

33:13.517 --> 33:14.620
You're growing.

33:14.724 --> 33:16.310
Still in the process.

33:16.413 --> 33:19.827
And I'm not saying no, never.

33:19.931 --> 33:22.310
I'm saying not right now.

33:23.758 --> 33:25.413
Augie,

33:25.517 --> 33:27.068
have a summer,

33:27.172 --> 33:29.034
finish high school,

33:29.137 --> 33:32.793
and if you still want to look
into basic training after that,

33:32.896 --> 33:34.551
I'm not gonna stand in your way.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.344
He's such a hypocrite.

33:55.448 --> 33:57.586
I know that it feels that way,

33:57.689 --> 33:59.275
but, come on,
do you really want to cut

33:59.379 --> 34:01.103
all that beautiful hair
for the army?

34:11.103 --> 34:12.551
Hey.

34:12.655 --> 34:14.310
I love you, Toad.

35:48.034 --> 35:50.068
Just a quick change
and then we're out of here.

35:50.172 --> 35:51.551
Yes. I need to get
these shoes off,

35:51.655 --> 35:53.344
but I'll keep my bra on.

35:53.448 --> 35:55.724
That sounds like a plan to me.

35:58.275 --> 35:59.551
Oh, my God.

35:59.655 --> 36:01.241
What the hell?

36:07.068 --> 36:09.758
Stella, what do we d...

36:13.413 --> 36:15.275
Someone's still here.

36:52.103 --> 36:53.551
It's really bad.

36:53.655 --> 36:55.517
Oh, God.

36:56.689 --> 36:57.896
Look, here.

37:01.724 --> 37:03.827
Is that...

37:03.931 --> 37:05.793
Witt. From the party.

37:08.586 --> 37:12.034
Do you think he was here
looking for you? For us?

37:12.137 --> 37:13.620
Oh, God.

37:14.310 --> 37:15.827
Take this.

37:20.448 --> 37:23.517
- What are you doing?
- He's gonna bleed out
if we don't get help.

37:23.620 --> 37:25.275
- Well, just wait.
- What do you mean, wait?

37:25.379 --> 37:28.068
- He's bleeding...
- Just wait for a minute
and just think.

37:28.172 --> 37:29.241
Okay?

37:29.344 --> 37:31.034
How is this gonna look?

37:31.137 --> 37:32.448
Worse if we don't call somebody.

37:32.551 --> 37:34.172
If you call somebody,

37:34.275 --> 37:36.379
then this whole thing
is set in motion.

37:36.482 --> 37:38.448
It was self-defense.
It was an accident.

37:38.551 --> 37:41.310
Yeah, and we know him,
and I have a record.

37:41.413 --> 37:43.241
You have a record.

37:46.310 --> 37:48.724
Ugh, I just mean...

37:48.827 --> 37:50.620
who would you even call?

37:52.896 --> 37:55.310
That's gonna be warm.
You said two pieces of bacon?

37:55.413 --> 37:57.482
All right. Uh, here you go.

37:57.586 --> 38:00.310
And napkins are inside.

38:00.413 --> 38:02.448
Thank y'all. Ger.

38:02.551 --> 38:04.689
- Oh, my gosh, Augie is trying...
- Hey.

38:04.793 --> 38:06.689
...so hard to stay awake
in there.

38:06.793 --> 38:09.689
I bet he's, uh, trying
to stay awake for Sadie.

38:09.793 --> 38:12.344
Well, who knows
what those girls got into.

38:12.448 --> 38:13.689
- Might be waiting a while.
- Yeah.

38:13.793 --> 38:14.862
Yeah.

38:14.965 --> 38:15.965
You good?

38:16.068 --> 38:17.172
Yeah, yeah.

38:17.275 --> 38:19.241
Okay.

38:19.344 --> 38:21.000
Geri, actually,

38:21.103 --> 38:22.896
um...

38:23.000 --> 38:25.827
I-I don't know if you have

38:25.931 --> 38:29.137
something going on with
this Jesse guy at the cabin.

38:29.241 --> 38:30.586
- Jesse?
- Yeah.

38:30.689 --> 38:32.241
No, there's... there's nothing.

38:32.344 --> 38:33.896
I'm glad to hear that.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
Uh, hey.

38:37.689 --> 38:41.000
What do you think about
staying here this summer?

38:42.034 --> 38:44.931
We can all celebrate
Sadie's birthday together.

38:45.034 --> 38:47.137
Why don't you stay here?

38:47.241 --> 38:49.241
Why don't you...

38:49.344 --> 38:52.551
stay here with me?

40:26.517 --> 40:28.689
Hey. What's going on?

40:29.758 --> 40:32.517
Years ago, there was this case,

40:32.620 --> 40:34.137
this serial killer.

40:34.241 --> 40:35.586
We called him the Jackal.

40:35.689 --> 40:37.448
Larry and I chased it,

40:37.551 --> 40:40.275
and Larry, he got obsessed.

40:40.379 --> 40:41.620
I mean, he became

40:41.724 --> 40:44.068
consumed.

40:45.724 --> 40:47.586
I mean, could it really be him,

40:47.689 --> 40:49.551
after all this time?

40:50.379 --> 40:51.862
It might be.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.275
So...

40:54.379 --> 40:56.172
case went cold. We got

40:56.275 --> 40:58.275
pulled off by the state,

40:58.379 --> 40:59.724
but a man just died,

40:59.827 --> 41:02.758
one of his intended victims
during that time,

41:02.862 --> 41:06.655
but, uh, you know, we were able
to save him back then.

41:08.310 --> 41:10.482
But, um...

41:11.275 --> 41:14.827

may have finally got him.
