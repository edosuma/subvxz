00:09.864 --> 00:11.622
Alan Shore!

00:13.562 --> 00:16.656
Alan! Where is Alan Shore?

00:16.656 --> 00:17.704
Alan Shore!

00:17.704 --> 00:19.607
–Hold her right there!
–The wedding gown.

00:19.647 --> 00:20.760
Alan Shore!

00:20.760 --> 00:22.939
Do you know Alan Shore?
Alan? Oh, no.

00:22.979 --> 00:25.575
Alan! Alan Shore!

00:25.916 --> 00:27.540
Alan!

00:27.540 --> 00:29.631
–Renatta…
–Okay, I know this looks really bad,

00:29.671 --> 00:31.404
but you have to believe me
I didn't do it.

00:31.444 --> 00:33.557
Please don't leave.
–Say nothing, Renatta.

00:33.597 --> 00:36.588
This woman is represented by council.
No interrogation. –Thank you, Alan.

00:36.628 --> 00:38.500
–I'll meet you in lockup. Okay?
–Okay. Okay, Alan.

00:38.540 --> 00:40.255
All right? It will be all right.

00:40.295 --> 00:41.947
You have the attorney.
Remain silent.

00:41.987 --> 00:43.207
Sir.

00:51.840 --> 00:53.592
Renatta…

00:53.981 --> 00:57.367
This is original even for you.

00:58.898 --> 01:00.726
I brought you a change of clothes.

01:00.766 --> 01:01.800
Ah, that's thoughtful.

01:01.840 --> 01:04.968
Actually, they need
the dress for evidence.

01:06.384 --> 01:07.858
So…

01:08.344 --> 01:10.286
tell me.

01:10.623 --> 01:11.968
From the start.

01:11.968 --> 01:15.719
Well, after you and I broke up,
I went back to my apartment.

01:15.759 --> 01:17.681
Skip ahead four or five years.

01:17.721 --> 01:20.620
Javier and I met at the opera.

01:20.620 --> 01:24.550
It was Strauss' ‘Die Fledermaus’.

01:24.550 --> 01:28.146
I was sitting in front of him,
he started playing with my hair.

01:28.186 --> 01:32.518
From there it was pretty much
a straight line to the engagement.

01:32.518 --> 01:35.231
Would you like me to look away?

01:35.231 --> 01:38.382
Yeah, if you have
to sneeze or something.

01:38.382 --> 01:41.945
We opted for a courthouse
wedding because…

01:41.945 --> 01:44.807
well, who needs a big fuss?
Besides I thought it was fitting.

01:44.847 --> 01:47.458
You know how much I love the law.

01:47.458 --> 01:49.037
We arrived.

01:49.037 --> 01:53.468
Waited for a bit in the corridor
with the other happy couples.

01:53.468 --> 01:57.189
I believe they need everything.

01:57.189 --> 01:59.190
The clerk showed us to a waiting room

01:59.230 --> 02:02.400
where we get ready for a few
minutes before the ceremony.

02:02.440 --> 02:06.808
Then he left to take another
couple to the judge's chambers.

02:06.808 --> 02:09.443
We necked for a bit.

02:09.443 --> 02:13.490
Then I began to feel weak.

02:13.490 --> 02:19.853
This corset was cutting off
my circulation. I…

02:20.507 --> 02:21.927
I fainted.

02:21.927 --> 02:26.630
When I came to, there he was
lying in a pool of blood.

02:26.630 --> 02:32.814
His own ice-tempered beveled edge stainless
steel scissors sticking out of his chest.

02:32.814 --> 02:35.160
He was a wig maker.
–Of course.

02:35.160 --> 02:37.858
He takes scissors with him everywhere.

02:37.858 --> 02:41.876
He was talking about giving me
a trim before the ceremony.

02:41.876 --> 02:43.962
He was always at me
with those scissors.

02:44.002 --> 02:46.672
You can see how bouncy my ends are.

02:46.672 --> 02:52.375
I've pulled out the shears
hoping to save him but…

02:54.146 --> 02:56.447
nothing.

02:56.447 --> 02:59.213
He was dead.

02:59.942 --> 03:02.355
Renatta…

03:03.845 --> 03:06.243
I have missed you.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON ABC: 2007/03/20

03:36.464 --> 03:40.875
<i>A local attorney, many are now calling,
the Bloody Bride was arrested today</i>

03:40.915 --> 03:43.501
<i>on the charge of murdering her
would-be husband.</i>

03:43.541 --> 03:45.622
<i>Respected jurors were
startled this morning</i>

03:45.662 --> 03:48.668
<i>by the sight of Renatta Hill
rushing past them,</i>

03:48.708 --> 03:51.292
<i>her white gown covered in blood.</i>

03:51.292 --> 03:54.189
“Bloody Bride”, like that
won't taint the jury pool.

03:54.229 --> 03:57.618
As I'm sure, you're aware
Mr Shore is representing Ms Hill.

03:57.658 --> 04:01.054
Please refrain from
speaking to the press.

04:01.054 --> 04:03.035
The firm will comment when appropriate.

04:03.075 --> 04:05.603
If anybody needs me,
I'll be on my cell.

04:05.643 --> 04:06.852
And where are you going?

04:06.892 --> 04:08.075
Rehab.

04:08.075 --> 04:09.972
I said something bad about
the Jews, I don't know what,

04:10.012 --> 04:12.079
but Bethany has left me over it.

04:12.119 --> 04:17.196
Anyway, I recognize that I have issues
I need to examine within my soul.

04:17.196 --> 04:20.628
I'm getting treatment. And with
the help of family and friends

04:20.668 --> 04:23.133
I shall make a full recovery.

04:35.790 --> 04:38.991
Ms Simms, there is a man here to see
you and he's claiming that…

04:39.031 --> 04:40.302
There she is.

04:40.302 --> 04:41.946
Where have you been?
–Who are you?

04:41.986 --> 04:44.904
My name is Jerome Harris and I'm
your client. That's who I am.

04:44.944 --> 04:45.815
No, please.

04:45.815 --> 04:47.984
Here is the card she gave me.

04:48.612 --> 04:50.356
Claire, this is your card.

04:50.356 --> 04:53.212
Uh, sir, if I may ask what is
your case about?

04:53.252 --> 04:54.966
I was charged with stealing
a cell phone.

04:55.006 --> 04:56.448
Oops.

04:57.436 --> 04:59.986
It got assigned to me when
I was in court on something else.

05:00.026 --> 05:02.319
I must have blocked it out.
You can see why.

05:02.359 --> 05:05.017
Lady, I'm a human being.

05:05.017 --> 05:07.492
Mr Harris, when is your trial?

05:07.492 --> 05:09.800
–Today.
–Today?

05:09.800 --> 05:11.617
Whatever. Let's go.

05:11.617 --> 05:12.946
You go and give me
a continuance, right?

05:12.986 --> 05:14.770
–Jerry…
–It's Jerome.

05:14.770 --> 05:15.875
You can't pay.

05:15.875 --> 05:18.534
Why would I stretch it out
when you can't pay?

05:18.574 --> 05:22.022
Claire, perhaps you should
get a continuance.

05:22.022 --> 05:24.417
For a stolen cell phone?

05:25.518 --> 05:26.967
Give me your jacket.

05:26.967 --> 05:29.879
–What?
–Just give it to me.

05:35.293 --> 05:36.885
Put it on.

05:37.722 --> 05:39.284
Tie.
–I'm not going to…

05:39.284 --> 05:42.607
It's an emergency. Tie!

05:53.515 --> 05:54.734
Come on, Jerry.

05:54.734 --> 05:56.305
It's Jerome.

06:01.341 --> 06:04.392
Renatta Hill on the charges
of murder in the first degree,

06:04.432 --> 06:06.518
how do you plead?
–Not guilty, your honor.

06:06.558 --> 06:08.954
–Request bail.
–Bail? Are you kidding?

06:08.994 --> 06:11.368
This is my kidding face.

06:11.730 --> 06:13.810
This is my mean-it face.
Watch again.

06:13.850 --> 06:14.830
Request bail.

06:14.830 --> 06:16.966
You honor, she was
caught fleeing the scene

06:17.006 --> 06:19.903
covered in the victim's blood,
brandishing the murder weapon.

06:19.943 --> 06:21.305
Entirely circumstantial.

06:21.345 --> 06:24.048
Further, as an attorney, Miss Hill
is an officer of the court

06:24.088 --> 06:26.861
and a responsible, reliable
member of the community.

06:26.901 --> 06:28.339
Can anyone attest to that?

06:28.379 --> 06:31.803
Any associates at the current law firm?

06:32.385 --> 06:35.378
–No, sir. –Any associates
at the previous law firm?

06:35.418 --> 06:38.083
Myself. The defendant and I
worked together at Cruthers & Abbott.

06:38.123 --> 06:41.511
Your honor, that's the firm that
Mr Shore was fired from for embezzling.

06:41.551 --> 06:43.491
Objection.
Charges were never brought

06:43.531 --> 06:47.438
and confidentiality agreement
prevents me from talking about it further.

06:47.478 --> 06:49.034
Can we get back to this case?

06:49.074 --> 06:51.827
Any family members to
vouch for her character,

06:51.867 --> 06:56.766
friends, neighbors, college roommates?

06:59.071 --> 07:01.514
Bail denied. Next.

07:01.514 --> 07:03.320
I'm right behind you.

07:07.623 --> 07:10.369
Just so you know,
I didn't take that phone.

07:10.409 --> 07:11.923
What do you mean you didn't take it?

07:11.963 --> 07:14.330
You were arrested with it in your hand.

07:14.370 --> 07:18.396
Yeah, but I didn't mean to take it,
you know what I'm saying?

07:18.677 --> 07:20.810
Uh, wait right here.

07:21.613 --> 07:23.783
Warren, Claire Simms.

07:23.783 --> 07:26.167
We actually met
at the DA's Christmas party.

07:26.207 --> 07:27.662
Yeah, I remember.

07:27.662 --> 07:29.245
I asked you to dance.

07:29.245 --> 07:30.379
You laughed.

07:30.379 --> 07:32.213
I was involved.

07:32.213 --> 07:37.273
Listen, I'm actually
representing Jerome, um…

07:38.075 --> 07:40.715
Harris on the stolen cell phone case.

07:40.715 --> 07:42.218
How about we plead sufficient facts?

07:42.258 --> 07:44.088
Three months suspended,
call it a day.

07:44.128 --> 07:45.157
Let him go?

07:45.157 --> 07:46.911
Suspended sentence,
that's not…

07:46.951 --> 07:48.120
Do you think I'm a dope?

07:48.160 --> 07:51.843
This is his fourth offense this year.

07:51.843 --> 07:54.321
Warren, I could be wrong.

07:54.321 --> 07:57.823
But it seems they've given you
a very small case to cut your teeth on.

07:57.863 --> 07:59.798
Now if you want to get the bigger trials,

07:59.838 --> 08:01.720
you need to win the itty-bitty ones.

08:01.760 --> 08:03.747
Especially the seemingly slam dunks.

08:03.787 --> 08:07.538
But the thing is,
you don't want to risk losing this.

08:07.759 --> 08:08.914
Losing?

08:08.914 --> 08:12.601
He was caught red-handed with the phone,
making a call on it, by the way.

08:12.641 --> 08:16.145
–Warren… –And I don't like the way
you use my first name, okay?

08:16.185 --> 08:18.721
You and I are not familiar
with one another.

08:18.761 --> 08:21.733
You laughed when
I asked you to dance.

08:21.733 --> 08:24.156
And stop eating my lunch!

08:25.078 --> 08:27.584
Will you at least agree to
continue it until tomorrow?

08:27.624 --> 08:30.051
I just got this file.

08:30.275 --> 08:32.523
One day, that's it.

08:38.121 --> 08:40.061
Back here at 9 A.M.
Suit and tie.

08:40.101 --> 08:42.657
Ho, ho, hold on. I'm not comfortable
that you're trying that hard, so—

08:42.697 --> 08:45.926
you know what I'm saying?
–9 o'clock.

08:51.584 --> 08:54.738
Renatta, your bloody dress,
your possession of the murder weapon,

08:54.778 --> 08:57.079
you being alone with the victim,

08:57.079 --> 09:00.966
the absence of anyone to say
anything good about you.

09:00.966 --> 09:03.147
We're off to a bit of a somber start.

09:03.187 --> 09:06.927
I know it's, it's too obvious, isn't it?
I must be innocent.

09:06.967 --> 09:09.257
Even without such
a preponderance of evidence,

09:09.297 --> 09:13.173
85% of all murder trials
result in conviction.

09:13.173 --> 09:15.497
And here we've got
the added element, well…

09:15.537 --> 09:17.033
you're not innocent.
–I am.

09:17.073 --> 09:20.973
–Renatta.
–Alan! I didn't kill him.

09:21.143 --> 09:22.904
No idea who snuck into the waiting room.

09:22.944 --> 09:24.130
I was passed out.

09:24.130 --> 09:25.584
Well, if you didn't do it, who did?

09:25.624 --> 09:27.463
I don't know.

09:27.463 --> 09:31.157
He had an old girlfriend
who was harassing him.

09:31.157 --> 09:32.388
I don't even know her name.

09:32.428 --> 09:34.559
And you think she snuck in
while you were conveniently passed out?

09:34.599 --> 09:37.582
Probably guessing the corset would
put you out for at least a few minutes,

09:37.622 --> 09:40.727
and stabbed your fiancé?
–I don't know.

09:40.727 --> 09:46.181
All I do know is
I didn't murder Javier.

09:56.941 --> 09:58.077
<i>Any comment?</i>

09:58.117 --> 10:00.076
I'm sorry. I can not comment
on this case.

10:00.116 --> 10:01.810
But I can comment on other cases.

10:01.850 --> 10:03.796
O.J. did it.
Robert Blake did it.

10:03.836 --> 10:06.155
John Mark Karr wishes he did it.

10:07.128 --> 10:09.383
We have over two dozen eyewitnesses.

10:09.423 --> 10:11.387
Did you develop any other suspects?

10:11.427 --> 10:14.218
We canvased exhaustively,
but no other suspects.

10:14.258 --> 10:18.093
And when Miss Hill came out of the door,
she was covered in the victim's blood.

10:18.133 --> 10:20.964
And what did the stab wounds
on the victim tell us about the killer?

10:21.004 --> 10:23.208
The angle and the depth of
the wounds tell us that

10:23.248 --> 10:26.198
the killer was between
5′2″ and 5′4″ tall

10:26.198 --> 10:29.321
and weighed approximately
115 to 120 pounds.

10:29.321 --> 10:33.161
–Is Miss Hill this height and weight?
–Yes, Miss Hill is.

10:33.161 --> 10:35.831
–You said you canvased exhaustively.
–Yes.

10:35.871 --> 10:39.339
How about the 650 people who were
called to jury duty that day?

10:39.379 --> 10:42.293
We had no cause to focus on them.

10:42.293 --> 10:43.407
Oh.

10:43.407 --> 10:47.752
So did you focus on the couriers
or food service people,

10:47.752 --> 10:50.261
the dozens of homeless people who are
there looking for a bathroom,

10:50.301 --> 10:52.336
or really any members
of the general public

10:52.376 --> 10:54.467
who are perfectly entitled to
enter the courthouse?

10:54.507 --> 10:57.566
–No. –So when you said
you searched exhaustively,

10:57.606 --> 10:58.912
it was just until you got tired.

10:58.952 --> 11:00.675
–Objection.
–Sustained.

11:00.675 --> 11:02.613
And what about the crime scene?

11:02.653 --> 11:04.938
Would you say it had been well secured

11:04.978 --> 11:08.842
and it was utterly free from contamination
at the time you got there to,

11:08.882 --> 11:14.345
you know, evaluate blood trails, hair,
fiber, fingerprints, etc.

11:14.345 --> 11:19.435
A bloody bride ran out of the room,
the Looky Lous…

11:19.435 --> 11:21.582
had some contact with the scene.

11:21.582 --> 11:23.348
So it was contaminated?

11:23.348 --> 11:24.287
It was.

11:24.287 --> 11:26.031
And as for the blood stained dress,

11:26.071 --> 11:29.809
her fiancé had scissors
sticking out of his chest.

11:29.809 --> 11:32.475
Her instinct was to remove
the scissors

11:32.475 --> 11:35.585
and grab him, shake him,
anything to revive him.

11:35.625 --> 11:38.454
Wouldn't that, in fact, get
the blood on the dress?

11:38.494 --> 11:41.574
So would stabbing him and
then grabbing him, in fact.

11:41.614 --> 11:44.241
The victim had three previous fiancés,

11:44.241 --> 11:47.059
he abandoned each of them
before their vows. Did you know this?

11:47.099 --> 11:48.853
None of them was placed at the scene.

11:48.893 --> 11:50.185
Just so you know our thinking,

11:50.225 --> 11:52.636
there was one person in that
courthouse who knew him,

11:52.676 --> 11:55.433
ran from the room drenched in his blood

11:55.433 --> 11:58.350
clutching the murder weapon
and asking for a defense attorney.

11:58.390 --> 12:01.278
It seemed like a pretty solid lead.

12:16.346 --> 12:17.336
What the…

12:17.336 --> 12:19.423
It's the only suit I've got, okay?

12:19.463 --> 12:20.530
Are you crazy?

12:20.530 --> 12:21.979
This suit brings me luck, okay?

12:22.019 --> 12:23.829
I got married in this suit.

12:23.829 --> 12:24.654
You're divorced.

12:24.694 --> 12:27.360
Well, I got lucky that day.

12:27.564 --> 12:29.840
Let's just get in there, Jerome.

12:35.571 --> 12:36.541
Rehab?

12:36.541 --> 12:38.055
It's fantastic, Bethany.

12:38.095 --> 12:39.870
They help clear up
outstanding parking tickets,

12:39.910 --> 12:41.408
assist with the travel plans.

12:41.448 --> 12:43.953
You name it, everybody should do it.
It's like going to A.A.

12:43.993 --> 12:45.163
Only they let you drink.

12:45.203 --> 12:47.371
Denny, you are not taking
what you said seriously.

12:47.411 --> 12:51.297
Bethany, it is not anti-semitic
to question Israel's politics.

12:51.337 --> 12:53.921
–Yes, it is.
–Why?

12:54.220 --> 12:55.663
Just forget it. I'm leaving.

12:55.703 --> 12:58.280
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait a minute!

12:58.320 --> 12:59.873
Wait.

13:03.415 --> 13:05.935
Bethany, if I sometimes come
off as insensitive,

13:05.975 --> 13:08.194
it's 'cause I got a lot to deal with.

13:08.234 --> 13:10.017
I got the, uh…

13:10.017 --> 13:11.562
mad cow.
I date a midget.

13:11.602 --> 13:13.162
I was in love with a midget's mother.

13:13.202 --> 13:14.523
It's not easy being me.

13:14.563 --> 13:17.397
Denny, I have fought my whole life
to get respect.

13:17.437 --> 13:19.587
–I respect you.
–No, you do not.

13:19.587 --> 13:22.595
You belittle my faith,
you call me a midget.

13:22.595 --> 13:25.654
Do you have the slightest idea
how offensive that word is?

13:25.694 --> 13:29.216
–Midget? –Yes, I'm a little person,
I'm not a midget.

13:29.216 --> 13:31.330
You do not respect me, Denny.

13:31.330 --> 13:33.461
It's a deal breaker.

13:38.852 --> 13:41.347
I was in the corridor
waiting to get married.

13:41.387 --> 13:44.347
I watched her and the dead guy
walk into the room.

13:44.387 --> 13:46.340
I mean, he wasn't dead yet.

13:46.340 --> 13:49.576
While they were in there,
did you see anybody come in or go out?

13:49.616 --> 13:51.146
Nope, no one.

13:51.146 --> 13:54.993
When Renatta and her fiance
went into that room,

13:54.993 --> 13:56.432
was your wife with you?

13:56.472 --> 13:58.407
She is not my wife yet.

13:58.407 --> 14:00.606
The day threw a wrench in our plans.

14:00.646 --> 14:02.066
Your whole life was about to change.

14:02.106 --> 14:04.132
You were about to jump
the broom as they say

14:04.172 --> 14:06.196
and you weren't distracted at all.

14:06.236 --> 14:09.791
Your eyes were clamped on that door
the entire time?

14:09.791 --> 14:13.015
–Yep. –And yet you mentioned
other wedding parties,

14:13.055 --> 14:17.434
another groom nearby, delivery people,
another sort of sorts,

14:17.434 --> 14:18.575
would you call that clamped.

14:18.615 --> 14:20.846
–Objection.
–Sustained.

14:20.846 --> 14:25.267
That bathroom door from behind
which your future wife-to-be

14:25.267 --> 14:30.291
was about to emerge and forever change
your life undoubtedly for the better,

14:30.291 --> 14:32.694
you never looked at that door?

14:32.694 --> 14:34.040
Maybe for a second.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.238
Mr Nayman,

14:35.238 --> 14:39.580
you were not looking at the door to
the waiting room the entire time, were you?

14:39.620 --> 14:40.995
Not the entire time, no.

14:41.035 --> 14:43.972
And yet you said Mr Palmer
quite unequivocally

14:44.012 --> 14:47.212
that nobody went in or out of that room.

14:47.212 --> 14:50.040
Did Mr Palmer tell you
to be unequivocal?

14:50.040 --> 14:52.047
–Objection.
–Overruled.

14:52.047 --> 14:53.687
Did Mr Palmer tell you to be certain?

14:53.727 --> 14:56.463
Well, he indicated it would be best.

15:17.540 --> 15:19.241
I'm no bigot.

15:19.241 --> 15:23.108
The truth is, growing up,
I never differentiated anybody.

15:23.108 --> 15:24.263
My family wasn't religious.

15:24.303 --> 15:27.077
I never know whether this Abraham
is Catholic or Jewish or…

15:27.117 --> 15:28.406
People are people.

15:28.406 --> 15:31.011
Denny, I believe you
when you say you aren't a bigot.

15:31.051 --> 15:33.443
But your insensitivity lies in the fact

15:33.483 --> 15:36.742
that you fail to realize that
bigotry is out there.

15:36.782 --> 15:38.062
I know it's out there.

15:38.102 --> 15:40.648
You say that religion or faith
isn't important to you,

15:40.688 --> 15:42.664
but it's important to others.

15:42.664 --> 15:45.410
It's important to Bethany.

15:52.620 --> 15:55.031
I was there waiting to get married.

15:55.031 --> 15:58.552
There was 20 of us couples and, uh,

15:58.552 --> 16:00.629
Tori had just went off to call
her mom to tell her.

16:00.669 --> 16:03.984
Were you in the hall when the defendant
and victim went into the room?

16:04.024 --> 16:07.281
Yeah, her and the Spanish guy
had this pretty intense thing.

16:07.321 --> 16:10.195
Do you recall any of
the element of this exchange?

16:10.235 --> 16:11.469
Yeah, some.

16:11.469 --> 16:14.143
He had said something about
things not working out

16:14.183 --> 16:17.601
and she started to get
really upset and, uh,

16:17.601 --> 16:19.422
so she says to him really shrill.

16:19.462 --> 16:22.887
She said, “you are jilting me?”

16:37.221 --> 16:40.075
Alcohol, marijuana, speed,

16:40.075 --> 16:43.511
mushrooms, LSD, cocaine, ecstasy.

16:43.511 --> 16:46.274
Stop me when I name something
you haven't done.

16:46.314 --> 16:48.364
What about the night before
your wedding day?

16:48.404 --> 16:52.227
Any special festivities,
bachelor party, pub crawl?

16:52.227 --> 16:55.418
No, actually, me and Tori
were at a Radiohead concert.

16:55.458 --> 16:59.618
Did you make use of the aforementioned
substances at the concert?

16:59.658 --> 17:02.382
Um, I'm, I'm testifying,

17:02.382 --> 17:05.630
so I have some sort of
drug arrest immunity, right?

17:05.670 --> 17:07.017
I'll take it as a yes.

17:07.057 --> 17:08.520
From my experience,

17:08.520 --> 17:11.387
any evening that begins
with a Radiohead concert

17:11.428 --> 17:14.705
has all the possibilities of
turning into an all-night affair.

17:14.746 --> 17:17.435
How much sleep did you get
the night before your wedding day?

17:17.474 --> 17:19.482
You can round up.

17:19.482 --> 17:20.337
None.

17:20.337 --> 17:22.701
So you had taken drugs,
you hadn't slept.

17:22.741 --> 17:24.244
I know what I know.

17:24.244 --> 17:26.594
You don't forget that lady saying that

17:26.634 --> 17:29.226
or the look on her face
when she realizes she's being dumped.

17:29.266 --> 17:33.002
You were hopped up on goofball,
why should we believe what you say?

17:33.042 --> 17:36.136
I'm a musician.
An artist, and, I mean…

17:36.136 --> 17:38.186
I mean, when you witness
something like that,

17:38.226 --> 17:40.286
it gets burned into your brain.

17:40.286 --> 17:43.463
I know what I heard.
He dumped her.

17:46.392 --> 17:51.572
May I ask, officer, how you were able to
track the telephone to the defendant?

17:51.572 --> 17:53.573
He kept using it making calls.

17:53.573 --> 17:56.211
He was actually talking on it
when we went to arrest him.

17:56.251 --> 17:58.829
That's not true.
I was checking my messages.

17:58.869 --> 18:04.608
And officer, the defendant was found to
have this stolen telephone

18:04.608 --> 18:08.669
that marked and identified
as People's exhibit C

18:08.669 --> 18:12.325
in his possession at the time
you apprehended him, right, officer?

18:12.365 --> 18:13.661
Yes, sir.

18:13.661 --> 18:15.464
–Right in his hand?
–Yes, sir.

18:15.504 --> 18:19.033
Thank you, officer.
I have no further questions.

18:26.001 --> 18:28.717
60 days, credit for time served,
the rest suspended.

18:28.757 --> 18:30.674
I'll have one drink with you.

18:30.674 --> 18:34.415
You're inappropriate and
your offer is rejected.

18:35.369 --> 18:39.269
So you arrested my client for being
in possession of stolen merchandise.

18:39.309 --> 18:41.759
No, I arrested him for stealing
the merchandise.

18:41.799 --> 18:43.944
And how do you know
he's the one who took it?

18:43.984 --> 18:45.217
He told me.

18:45.217 --> 18:48.490
He said it looked like his phone
and he took it by mistake.

18:48.530 --> 18:50.573
Do you know that not to be true?

18:50.613 --> 18:54.165
I have phone records to show over
68 calls received by the stolen phone

18:54.205 --> 18:55.909
after it was reported missing.

18:55.949 --> 18:58.539
The ring on the phone was
Beethoven's 5th Symphony.

18:58.579 --> 19:01.197
His phone ring was
the theme to Sponge Bob.

19:01.237 --> 19:04.360
We can also prove he played the messages
on the stolen phone's voicemail.

19:04.400 --> 19:07.344
So at some point he had to
know it wasn't his phone.

19:07.384 --> 19:09.814
Okay. Thanks.

19:12.450 --> 19:13.700
That's it?

19:13.700 --> 19:15.609
What the hell was that?
You barely touched him.

19:15.649 --> 19:17.601
Just be quiet, Jerome.

19:17.601 --> 19:19.615
Mr Peters, anything else?

19:19.615 --> 19:21.282
Prosecution rests, your honor.

19:21.322 --> 19:22.887
Very well. Miss Simms?

19:22.887 --> 19:24.557
Defense rests, judge.

19:24.557 --> 19:25.837
–Rests?
–Jerome…

19:25.837 --> 19:27.351
Lady, I'm a human being.

19:27.391 --> 19:29.395
Okay. Again with
the human being defense.

19:29.435 --> 19:32.330
I know what I'm doing.
Can you just trust me?

19:32.370 --> 19:35.098
Trust you?
Trust you to do what?

19:41.219 --> 19:43.121
How could you not tell me
he was leaving you?

19:43.161 --> 19:44.495
It's embarrassing.
It's cliché.

19:44.535 --> 19:47.301
–It's motive.
–Oh, yeah, that.

19:49.748 --> 19:52.347
So he was leaving you.

19:52.347 --> 19:55.145
If you wanted to end things,
why go to the waiting room?

19:55.185 --> 19:56.487
If I could change his mind, Alan,

19:56.527 --> 19:58.496
I thought if we had a moment together
in private, everything might…

19:58.536 --> 20:01.663
With motive they've got you, Renatta.

20:05.297 --> 20:08.266
I shouldn't have to go to prison.

20:12.788 --> 20:18.002
We might have to change our plea
to not guilty by reason of temporary insanity.

20:18.406 --> 20:25.579
We can say you were mentally undone
by the surprise of the breakup.

20:25.579 --> 20:29.927
It would mean a psychiatric
facility instead of prison.

20:31.913 --> 20:33.566
No.

20:33.939 --> 20:37.971
Renatta, you're forcing me to
put you on the stand.

20:41.765 --> 20:43.595
No.

20:46.968 --> 20:50.162
What aren't you telling me?

20:50.162 --> 20:51.822
I didn't kill him.

20:51.822 --> 20:55.529
He broke up with me but that
had nothing to do with the murder.

20:55.569 --> 20:57.306
Nada?

20:58.507 --> 21:00.851
I didn't faint.

21:01.033 --> 21:03.909
I didn't faint and
I saw who killed him.

21:03.909 --> 21:05.913
Who?

21:06.838 --> 21:09.124
Renatta Hill.

21:09.745 --> 21:12.366
The actual Renatta Hill.

21:15.066 --> 21:16.950
Renatta Hill is a girl that I met

21:16.990 --> 21:19.924
when we were both in law school
together in Tulane.

21:19.964 --> 21:21.833
I assumed her identity.

21:21.833 --> 21:24.187
What do you mean
you assumed her identity?

21:24.227 --> 21:27.847
My name was Sarah…

21:27.847 --> 21:29.112
Popil.

21:29.112 --> 21:33.476
Things had not been going well
for me on various…

21:33.476 --> 21:36.337
numerous assorted fronts.

21:36.337 --> 21:38.570
And to top it off,
I failed the Bar.

21:38.610 --> 21:42.151
Renatta had passed the Bar.
Her life was in order.

21:42.151 --> 21:44.088
But while she was waiting for
her test results,

21:44.128 --> 21:47.304
she was in Alaska studying flora.

21:47.304 --> 21:49.264
And she fell in love with a man.

21:49.304 --> 21:51.962
The civilized world suddenly
seemed pointless to her.

21:52.002 --> 21:55.570
She decided to give up the rat
race and the dirty, dirty law career

21:55.610 --> 22:00.914
to start a life with this man
and become, as she put it, real.

22:00.914 --> 22:05.290
So I purchased her identity for $300,000.

22:05.290 --> 22:06.977
She went off to Alaska,

22:06.977 --> 22:09.704
I stopped being Sara Popil

22:09.704 --> 22:14.077
and started my fabulous life
as Renatta Hill.

22:14.077 --> 22:15.966
It gets better.

22:15.966 --> 22:20.696
After 18 years, the real Renatta's Alaskan
life went completely down the tubes,

22:20.736 --> 22:24.534
Her romance, her overnight
career, job, everything.

22:24.534 --> 22:27.150
And she came back.

22:28.670 --> 22:32.311
A few days before the wedding,
she was unhinged,

22:32.311 --> 22:36.104
unraveling, insisting that
we 86 our arrangement,

22:36.104 --> 22:38.722
but I paid for her life,

22:38.722 --> 22:41.020
which is my life now.

22:41.020 --> 22:42.501
And I said no.

22:42.501 --> 22:46.494
The next morning,
she followed me completely irrational,

22:46.494 --> 22:49.702
obsessed with the fact that my life
was going well, that hers wasn't,

22:49.742 --> 22:51.848
that I was getting married with her name.

22:51.888 --> 22:53.654
Then she snuck into the waiting room.

22:53.694 --> 22:55.969
She was in her couriers uniform,

22:55.969 --> 22:59.252
a delivery person in a corridor
going in and out of the door on a busy day,

22:59.292 --> 23:00.853
who would've noticed?

23:00.853 --> 23:03.904
She attacked me, I struggled.
She grabbed the shears,

23:03.944 --> 23:06.985
I fought. That's how I got these cuts.

23:06.985 --> 23:10.210
And Javier interceded
and she stabbed him.

23:10.210 --> 23:13.093
Zipped up the jacket, I left.

23:13.093 --> 23:15.298
If this preposterous story was true,

23:15.338 --> 23:18.429
–It is. –…why didn't you
just tell me at the start,

23:18.469 --> 23:22.807
not halfway through your murder trial
with the rest of your life at stake?

23:22.847 --> 23:24.638
I guess that's just it.

23:24.638 --> 23:29.592
I wanted to save my life,
which is Renatta Hill.

23:29.592 --> 23:33.712
I figure at least the real
Renatta will be gone forever now.

23:33.712 --> 23:36.553
You can't possibly expect me to
believe all this.

23:36.593 --> 23:42.334
Alan, you've always known
when to believe me.

23:45.555 --> 23:47.286
The name the other woman
was living under

23:47.326 --> 23:51.253
in Clark village, Alaska was
Susan Grey, with ‘e’.

23:51.253 --> 23:54.352
–Apparently the town is tiny. So it
shouldn't be difficult to verify. –Okay.

23:54.392 --> 23:58.522
And anything and everything you can
pick up on this one, Sarah Popil with an ‘i’.

23:58.562 --> 23:59.566
Start in New Orleans,

23:59.606 --> 24:02.142
check the registrar's office in Tulane,
go from there.

24:02.182 --> 24:03.936
As soon as possible, Clarence.

24:03.976 --> 24:05.191
Okay.

24:11.558 --> 24:13.498
You deliberately trying to lose
and I know it.

24:13.538 --> 24:15.276
You want me in jail.
–You finished?

24:15.316 --> 24:17.037
No. I will get you.

24:17.037 --> 24:18.668
When this is all over,
I'll get you.

24:18.708 --> 24:22.074
If you think getting me stuck in jail
is gonna protect you, you're wrong.

24:22.114 --> 24:24.859
Are you threatening me, Jerome?

24:24.859 --> 24:28.328
Are you gonna add violent crime
to your already impressive résumé?

24:28.368 --> 24:31.657
Okay, Mr Peters, I'll hear from you.

24:31.863 --> 24:34.343
May it please the court…

24:36.094 --> 24:41.551
the, uh, the defendant,
Jerome Harris was found with the stolen
merchandise in his possession.

24:41.591 --> 24:42.807
He never returned it.

24:42.847 --> 24:45.199
More ever he had to know
the cell phone wasn't his.

24:45.239 --> 24:46.946
He had another person's emails.

24:46.986 --> 24:50.722
He used the phone repeatedly for two days
as the call logs indicated.

24:50.762 --> 24:54.642
This man simply decided that he liked
the phone and wanted to keep it for himself

24:54.682 --> 24:59.842
in violation of Massachusetts
general law chapter 132 subsection 3F,

24:59.842 --> 25:03.686
as such I would submit that
Mr Harris be found guilty of larceny

25:03.726 --> 25:10.436
pursuant to Massachusetts
general law chapter 132 subsection 3F.

25:10.436 --> 25:12.243
Miss Simms.

25:13.038 --> 25:15.934
I can't really argue except one thing.

25:15.934 --> 25:17.838
Intent is now meant as a crime.

25:17.878 --> 25:21.563
Specifically there has to be
concurrence between mind and act.

25:21.603 --> 25:23.075
Which basically means,

25:23.075 --> 25:27.662
that at the time Mr Harris took the phone,
he had to have the intent to steal it.

25:27.702 --> 25:31.257
The prosecution has offered
no evidence to establish that.

25:31.297 --> 25:36.152
My client simply could've mistakenly taken
the phone thinking it was his own,

25:36.192 --> 25:39.191
then decided to keep it
after realizing it wasn't his.

25:39.231 --> 25:41.781
Well, he certainly had
the requisite mental intent

25:41.821 --> 25:43.835
to deprive another person
of their property.

25:43.875 --> 25:48.393
But not at the time of the taking,
which is the prerequisite for concurrence.

25:48.433 --> 25:50.853
Even if that were a correct
statement under law—

25:50.893 --> 25:54.317
–It is. –…he would still be guilty of
possession of stolen property.

25:54.357 --> 25:57.211
If only you thought to charge possession.
You didn't.

25:57.251 --> 26:02.092
And you can't now because double jeopardy
applies to the lesser included.

26:02.092 --> 26:04.437
Your honor, he knew it wasn't his
when he took it.

26:04.477 --> 26:06.181
You didn't establish that, Mr Peters.

26:06.221 --> 26:08.098
And truth be told,
you didn't even allege it.

26:08.138 --> 26:09.718
Miss Simms is right.

26:09.718 --> 26:12.377
You didn't prove concurrence
between mind and act.

26:12.417 --> 26:15.510
I have no choice but to enter
a finding of not guilty.

26:15.550 --> 26:17.588
Mr Harris, you're free to go.

26:17.588 --> 26:20.062
You got lucky this time.

26:40.454 --> 26:44.772
Your story, as ridiculous as it is,
actually checks out.

26:44.986 --> 26:49.467
Sarah Popil fell off the face
of the Earth after leaving Tulane.

26:49.467 --> 26:52.995
There was a Susan Grey living
in Clark village, Alaska,

26:53.035 --> 26:56.725
who fairly matches the description
of both you and, uh…

26:56.725 --> 27:00.034
Renatta Hill who attended Tulane.

27:00.034 --> 27:04.673
So I guess the Renatta Hill I once
had on a bench by the duck pond was…

27:04.713 --> 27:06.562
Sarah Popil.

27:06.562 --> 27:08.836
So what do I do?

27:11.133 --> 27:15.194
Well, it seems Susan Grey
left Clark village about a year ago

27:15.194 --> 27:16.660
and hasn't been heard from since.

27:16.700 --> 27:20.079
I've struck out trying to track
her whereabouts,

27:20.079 --> 27:22.694
but even so, Renatta, um, Sarah—

27:22.694 --> 27:24.838
It's Renatta now.

27:25.193 --> 27:28.024
Telling your story means
charges ranging from fraud

27:28.064 --> 27:29.757
to practicing law without a license.

27:29.797 --> 27:31.561
You'll be lucky to
get out in three years.

27:31.601 --> 27:34.629
Or the jury doesn't believe you
and you'll get life.

27:34.669 --> 27:37.295
Or they could believe you and still
think you're the one who killed Javier.

27:37.335 --> 27:39.541
Since we can't show
the other Renatta was even there.

27:39.581 --> 27:41.023
Except for my word.

27:41.023 --> 27:44.352
Which won't exactly ring
with credibility.

27:45.112 --> 27:46.922
So…

27:47.275 --> 27:49.066
what do we do?

27:49.536 --> 27:51.759
We know she's in Boston.
It was recently.

27:51.799 --> 27:55.761
Run a credit card, Susan Grey.
Also run Renatta Hill for the homeless.

27:55.801 --> 27:58.310
Here. John DePietri.
He's the PI I use.

27:58.350 --> 27:59.462
Tell him it's an emergency.

27:59.502 --> 28:01.507
–And if we find her, then what?
–Bring her to me.

28:01.547 --> 28:03.441
Tell John not to worry about
false imprisonment.

28:03.481 --> 28:06.766
She's far from clean.
Bring her to me fast.

28:17.848 --> 28:20.609
I was having coffee this morning
when my mother phoned.

28:20.649 --> 28:22.598
She said good luck in court today.

28:22.638 --> 28:24.224
I told her I would keep it in reserve

28:24.264 --> 28:29.539
because today I don't need luck
because these are the facts.

28:29.539 --> 28:33.788
Miss Hill had means,
the razor sharp shears.

28:33.788 --> 28:36.973
She had motive, her fiancé
had left her at the altar.

28:37.013 --> 28:41.040
She had opportunity,
there with him in the waiting room.

28:41.040 --> 28:44.512
The eyewitness accounts,
of the defendant with the murder weapon.

28:44.552 --> 28:48.983
There were no witnesses who saw anyone
else go in or out of that room.

28:49.023 --> 28:51.807
There are stab wounds
on the deceased

28:51.807 --> 28:54.925
which show conclusively to be made
by someone of Renatta Hill's

28:54.965 --> 28:58.683
particular height and weight.

28:58.683 --> 29:01.517
The number of people who saw Miss Hill

29:01.517 --> 29:05.910
running through the courthouse
in the bloody wedding gown are legion.

29:05.950 --> 29:08.323
And just to give us a disturbing image

29:08.363 --> 29:13.674
of what the encounter, what the victim's
last moments alive must have been like,

29:13.674 --> 29:20.308
there were cuts and bruises on Miss Hill's
hands indicating that he fought back.

29:20.308 --> 29:26.096
Now, you don't need me to give you
a big wrap-up to convince you to convict,

29:26.096 --> 29:30.562
just like I didn't
need my mother's luck.

29:30.562 --> 29:34.002
But I thanked her

29:34.293 --> 29:36.565
and I thank you.

29:48.612 --> 29:52.110
116,000 people strolled the hallways of

29:52.110 --> 29:56.380
the museum of modern art in New York city
over the course of 47 days

29:56.420 --> 30:01.299
to drink in the beauty and
simplicity of Matisse's Le Bateau.

30:01.299 --> 30:04.740
Clouds, water, a sailboat.

30:04.740 --> 30:07.146
They all looked right at it.

30:07.146 --> 30:12.581
And not one of those
116,000 people recognized

30:12.581 --> 30:14.825
that it was hanging there upside down.

30:14.865 --> 30:17.822
“This must be the right way to
look at it!” But it wasn't.

30:17.862 --> 30:20.748
Now here the district attorney
would be delighted

30:20.788 --> 30:23.835
if not one of you questioned
his version of the crime.

30:23.875 --> 30:26.758
But part of your obligation as jurors is

30:26.758 --> 30:30.903
to consider whether there is
another way to look at this.

30:39.915 --> 30:42.484
Would you want a woman deprived
of her future husband

30:42.524 --> 30:44.900
to spend the rest of her life in prison

30:44.940 --> 30:48.752
if it was even the slightest chance
that she may be innocent?

30:48.792 --> 30:50.553
And there is that chance.

30:50.553 --> 30:54.189
The prosecution could not establish
beyond all reasonable doubt

30:54.229 --> 30:55.973
that nobody else entered that room.

30:56.013 --> 30:58.666
They admit the crime scene
was contaminated.

30:58.706 --> 31:02.350
We know this man had jilted
three previous fiancés.

31:02.350 --> 31:04.158
Maybe it's possible
one of them showed up

31:04.198 --> 31:06.239
or maybe somebody completely different.

31:06.279 --> 31:09.761
We've heard testimony there were
a lot of people coming and going that day.

31:09.801 --> 31:12.384
Perhaps an individual slipped
unnoticed into the room,

31:12.424 --> 31:14.159
perhaps dressed as a delivery person

31:14.199 --> 31:16.324
amid the hustle and
bustle of the corridor.

31:16.364 --> 31:20.555
Everyone was distracted by
their own concerns as we all are.

31:20.555 --> 31:24.365
Maybe a woman, a brunette like
Renatta, quite like Renatta,

31:24.405 --> 31:26.774
perhaps this woman attacked Javier

31:26.774 --> 31:29.110
with his own scissors
which he grabbed from his bag.

31:29.150 --> 31:31.858
Or perhaps it was someone
from Renatta's past,

31:31.898 --> 31:34.692
and it was Renatta she attacked
in a jealous rage.

31:34.732 --> 31:36.541
And Javier was stabbed in the process.

31:36.581 --> 31:38.996
Perhaps Renatta was
the intended victim.

31:39.036 --> 31:42.230
Objection.
He is arguing facts not in evidence.

31:42.230 --> 31:45.090
There were no witnesses
to this crime whatsoever.

31:45.130 --> 31:46.635
That's a fact in evidence.

31:46.675 --> 31:49.736
Then suppose there was
another woman who did this.

31:49.776 --> 31:52.636
Well, ladies and gentlemen,
there is such a woman.

31:52.676 --> 31:55.442
We have found her and
we'll now produce her.

31:55.482 --> 31:57.835
She is willing to walk through that door

31:57.875 --> 32:01.656
if the district attorney agrees to
show leniency by discussing a plea.

32:01.696 --> 32:03.349
I assume you're willing to do that.
–What?

32:03.389 --> 32:06.084
Can I tell this woman you're
ameanable to a plea bargain?

32:06.124 --> 32:08.002
Your honor, there is no such woman.

32:08.042 --> 32:09.527
Then what's a harm in striking a deal?

32:09.567 --> 32:11.438
I'm not going to deal
with a mystery woman.

32:11.478 --> 32:13.742
How can you not
if you recognize she exist?

32:13.782 --> 32:15.278
I do not. I just…

32:15.278 --> 32:16.775
Have doubt. Reasonable doubt.

32:16.815 --> 32:19.661
Objection. I object to
counsel's entire summation.

32:19.701 --> 32:21.461
–Mr Shore.
–Never mind.

32:21.461 --> 32:24.196
Luckily for you, we have been able to
compel this woman to come forward,

32:24.236 --> 32:25.904
even in the absence of such a deal.

32:25.944 --> 32:28.106
Clarence, please bring her in.

32:53.794 --> 32:55.907
Okay. I was kidding.
She is not coming through the door

32:55.947 --> 32:57.982
but she could have.
–Your honor, this is a trick.

32:58.022 --> 33:01.267
I saw that Judd Nelson movie.
They also use that on Matlock.

33:01.307 --> 33:03.818
Really? I think
I saw it on Perry Mason.

33:03.858 --> 33:07.960
It is an old and venerable illusion
that has been used to great effect,

33:08.000 --> 33:10.380
dating all the way
back to the turn of the century.

33:10.420 --> 33:13.353
And apparently it's still
being used today to great amusement

33:13.393 --> 33:16.519
by others such as
Perry and Judd and…

33:16.519 --> 33:18.663
–Matlock.
–…and me.

33:18.663 --> 33:20.983
But regardless of the skill
with which it is executed,

33:21.023 --> 33:23.603
the success of the trick,
like any great trick,

33:23.643 --> 33:26.690
relies most of all on
the audience participation.

33:26.730 --> 33:29.895
On their predisposition to
the possibility of it working.

33:29.935 --> 33:31.908
The possibility that it could be true.

33:31.948 --> 33:35.330
That possibility is why you,
all of you, looked at the door.

33:35.370 --> 33:37.176
The district attorney looked at the door.

33:37.216 --> 33:41.945
Everyone looked at the door
with curiosity and expectation and belief.

33:41.945 --> 33:44.373
The belief that there is another woman.

33:44.413 --> 33:49.350
That belief, that is reasonable doubt.

33:49.350 --> 33:52.022
If you looked at the door,

33:52.323 --> 33:54.606
that's reasonable doubt.

34:09.735 --> 34:13.290
I believe you that you're
not so much a bigot as…

34:13.290 --> 34:17.284
–Buffoon?
–No. Just…

34:17.675 --> 34:20.572
Israel is a country about
the size of New Jersey

34:20.612 --> 34:23.253
surrounded by other countries
who want to destroy it

34:23.293 --> 34:25.606
because of its religious faith.

34:25.606 --> 34:29.254
What it's like to live with
that reality every day,

34:29.254 --> 34:32.949
you simply cannot separate
the history of persecution

34:32.949 --> 34:36.663
and the threat of future
persecution from its politics.

34:36.663 --> 34:40.222
Israeli politics go to survival.

34:40.222 --> 34:42.344
Can you get that?

34:46.487 --> 34:48.237
Knock, knock.

34:49.449 --> 34:51.760
If you're gonna borrow my
cell phone, the answer is no.

34:51.800 --> 34:54.186
I'm here to say thank you
and to apologize for…

34:54.226 --> 34:55.385
Threatening to kill me?

34:55.425 --> 34:57.150
I did not threaten to kill you.

34:57.191 --> 34:59.057
I just said I'd get you.

34:59.057 --> 35:00.216
And by that I mean, you know,

35:00.256 --> 35:02.966
disconnect your satellite dish
or something.

35:03.006 --> 35:06.502
Anyway, I'm sorry I doubted you.

35:06.741 --> 35:10.797
And I really am grateful for.

35:11.804 --> 35:15.407
Look, I know you don't
think much of me.

35:15.407 --> 35:16.952
Why should you?

35:16.952 --> 35:20.010
I spent a big part of my life
stealing things that don't belong to me.

35:20.050 --> 35:23.454
But you have given me a chance
to turn that around.

35:23.454 --> 35:24.748
I'm going to.

35:24.748 --> 35:26.532
I'm gonna go straight.

35:26.532 --> 35:28.563
I swear.

35:28.563 --> 35:30.738
And I have you to thank.

35:30.738 --> 35:36.696
In case you wonder whether you ever
made a difference in somebody's life,

35:37.353 --> 35:39.472
you have.

35:55.231 --> 35:56.090
What do you want?

35:56.130 --> 35:58.574
How is that gum working for you?

35:58.574 --> 35:59.706
I'm a smoker.

35:59.706 --> 36:02.669
I've been trying to quit for years
so I chew the gum.

36:02.709 --> 36:04.384
–Then quit.
–Sorry?

36:04.384 --> 36:08.681
You said “I'm a smoker, I've
been trying to quit for years.”

36:10.301 --> 36:14.148
I couldn't help but notice your demeanor
in the courtroom during my big finish.

36:14.188 --> 36:15.303
Something on your mind?

36:15.343 --> 36:18.021
Perhaps it's your career
flashing before your eyes.

36:18.061 --> 36:19.337
Nice try.

36:19.337 --> 36:21.757
She was witnessed fleeing the scene,
covered in blood,

36:21.797 --> 36:24.725
murder weapon in hand, nobody
else going in or out of the room.

36:24.765 --> 36:28.462
So if you were to lose this as
high profile as it is, that would be…

36:28.502 --> 36:32.551
atrocious.
Off to private practice for you.

36:32.551 --> 36:35.517
Second degree murder is a gift.

36:35.517 --> 36:37.267
The likelihood is they'll come in guilty.

36:37.307 --> 36:38.128
You're probably right.

36:38.168 --> 36:40.494
I suppose it's worth it to
take the chance.

36:40.534 --> 36:43.131
Specially with one's career on the line.

36:43.171 --> 36:45.165
Involuntary manslaughter, three years.

36:45.205 --> 36:48.171
You're insane.
Straight manslaughter, 12 years.

36:48.211 --> 36:49.959
We'll take it.

36:50.642 --> 36:52.278
–What?
–We'll take the 12.

36:52.318 --> 36:53.882
Hold on.

36:54.155 --> 36:56.813
I'll let you two discuss it.

37:01.367 --> 37:02.963
What the hell are you doing?

37:03.003 --> 37:06.433
He never would have made that offer
unless he thought that we could win.

37:06.473 --> 37:08.241
You didn't look at the door.

37:08.281 --> 37:11.684
Everyone in that courtroom had
their eyes glued on the door except me.

37:11.724 --> 37:14.972
because I knew that as much as I had
tried and as much as I had hoped,

37:15.012 --> 37:17.075
I couldn't find the real Renatta Hill.

37:17.115 --> 37:20.523
But you, why didn't
you look at the door?

37:20.523 --> 37:23.158
You didn't look because you did it.

37:23.158 --> 37:24.774
because you killed him.

37:24.774 --> 37:26.239
That's not even the funny part.

37:26.279 --> 37:28.673
Remember the note Clarence
brought me in the courtroom?

37:28.713 --> 37:31.624
Well, the funny part is,
if you follow the credit card receipts,

37:31.664 --> 37:35.304
you see the real Renatta
came to your door about a year ago.

37:35.344 --> 37:38.045
She stayed up the block,
she ate across the street.

37:38.085 --> 37:40.406
She came to say
she wanted her life back.

37:40.446 --> 37:41.896
You said no, she said yes.

37:41.936 --> 37:43.817
You said no, she said I'll tell.

37:43.857 --> 37:47.324
And you, Renatta, Sarah,

37:47.324 --> 37:49.627
psycho, you killed her.

37:49.627 --> 37:51.033
–I can't—
–Don't.

37:51.033 --> 37:54.444
The only reason you're not sprawled
on the floor under a bailiff with handcuffs

37:54.484 --> 37:58.296
is because of attorney client privilege
and frankly I don't need this that much.

37:58.336 --> 38:00.280
I've done a lot of talking over the years.

38:00.320 --> 38:03.248
I'm tired, I'm rich.

38:03.248 --> 38:06.146
Take the 12 or I'll walk
through that door

38:06.146 --> 38:10.639
and I'll get disbarred
and I'll push you away for life.

38:10.639 --> 38:12.105
Double first degree.

38:12.105 --> 38:16.718
It will be life
until the end of your life.

38:18.564 --> 38:21.550
–I'll take the 12.
–Good.

38:32.050 --> 38:33.800
How come you get
all the good cases?

38:33.840 --> 38:36.715
I'm left to stir up my own excitement.

38:37.783 --> 38:39.983
As long as you still can.

38:40.778 --> 38:43.141
You can learn something
every day, my friend.

38:43.181 --> 38:45.460
Even at the age of 73.

38:45.460 --> 38:49.156
What specifically did you learn today?

38:49.472 --> 38:51.548
People are complex.
Even the little people.

38:51.588 --> 38:53.789
They don't like to be called
midgets, you know.

38:53.829 --> 38:57.203
They're complex and very sensitive.

38:57.203 --> 39:00.707
They can also fly beneath the radar.

39:03.588 --> 39:05.156
Don't do that to me.

39:05.156 --> 39:06.844
Tell me the truth.

39:07.044 --> 39:11.599
Don't you think that Israel
overreacted in Lebanon?

39:11.599 --> 39:13.296
I do.

39:13.296 --> 39:15.283
But I suppose one could also look at it

39:15.323 --> 39:18.698
in the context of our
measured response to 9/11

39:18.698 --> 39:21.739
in which we invaded a country
that had nothing to do with us.

39:21.779 --> 39:24.009
You go again.
You are such a communist.

39:24.049 --> 39:26.588
You can cancel our sleepover.
Were we having one?

39:26.628 --> 39:28.036
No.

39:28.036 --> 39:32.062
You know, Denny, I have a very
close friend who is Jewish.

39:32.062 --> 39:33.413
Congratulations, you want a medal?

39:33.453 --> 39:34.820
I haven't finished.

39:34.820 --> 39:39.670
She shared with me that Jews are
perfectly happy to discuss among Jews

39:39.670 --> 39:41.713
the idea that Israel
may have been wrong.

39:41.753 --> 39:44.459
They don't want to talk about
it with non-Jews. –Why?

39:44.499 --> 39:50.480
Because Non-Jews can't possibly
comprehend the sense of persecution
Bethany was talking about

39:50.520 --> 39:55.159
and that comprehension is fundamental to
any meaningful discussion of the subject.

39:55.199 --> 40:00.120
So, what you're saying is it's not
my fault that I don't understand.

40:00.120 --> 40:01.985
It's not your fault.

40:01.985 --> 40:04.350
I feel better, thank you.

40:04.350 --> 40:05.536
Sleepover?

40:05.536 --> 40:06.365
Not tonight.

40:06.365 --> 40:08.327
–Tease.
–I'm not a tease.

40:08.327 --> 40:10.309
You led me on.
You're a tease.

40:10.309 --> 40:15.155
Why can't we ever have an intimate
conversation without it leading to a sleepover?

40:15.195 --> 40:18.242
Forget about it.
Just don't talk to me.

40:18.242 --> 40:20.226
–Fine.
–Fine.

40:23.226 --> 40:26.845
I get to enjoy a little personal
growth, you spoil it.

40:27.868 --> 40:30.500
–I thought we weren't talking.
–Fine.
