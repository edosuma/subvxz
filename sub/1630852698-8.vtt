WEBVTT

00:43.293 --> 00:45.962
The ones who get bullied
have a problem too.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.715
The kids must have
a reason for bullying you.

00:52.469 --> 00:53.303
Look.

00:54.929 --> 00:56.222
It's okay.

00:57.265 --> 00:58.349
Fuck off.

01:05.607 --> 01:06.566
You did nothing wrong?

01:10.153 --> 01:12.072
There's nothing you're sorry about?

01:14.032 --> 01:16.743
The kids must have
a reason for bullying you.

01:18.244 --> 01:21.122
PROVIDING AN EDUCATION
THAT WARMS AND STRENGTHENS LIVES

01:29.547 --> 01:31.633
I wish the school would burn down.

01:32.967 --> 01:34.385
So that nothing remains.

01:35.428 --> 01:36.805
So that everything disappears.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.197
Hey, Dae-su!

02:03.289 --> 02:05.291
What about the others?
Is it really just you?

02:06.209 --> 02:07.085
It's just me.

02:07.752 --> 02:09.170
Downstairs? In the classrooms?

02:09.254 --> 02:11.256
There's no one down there. It's just me!

02:24.394 --> 02:25.311
Hold tight!

02:26.229 --> 02:28.231
You're sure there's no one else, right?

02:29.399 --> 02:30.567
They're all zombies.

02:32.569 --> 02:33.444
They all died.

02:35.655 --> 02:36.948
Pull it tighter, guys.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.148
Give me your eye.

03:16.279 --> 03:18.198
What the hell? Fuck!

03:20.533 --> 03:21.951
Why didn't you die?

04:05.870 --> 04:08.081
DOOR WILL OPEN AUTOMATICALLY
IN CASE OF FIRE

04:08.831 --> 04:09.707
Guys!

04:10.208 --> 04:11.417
The door's open.

04:14.295 --> 04:17.507
-Let's go!
-One, two, three!

04:21.302 --> 04:22.804
-Look! A chopper!
-Over here!

04:22.887 --> 04:24.597
-Hey!
-Over here!

04:24.681 --> 04:25.556
Here!

04:25.640 --> 04:26.599
We're here!

04:26.683 --> 04:28.268
Help!

04:28.351 --> 04:29.852
Come back!

04:29.936 --> 04:31.229
-Help!
-Come back!

04:31.312 --> 04:33.982
-Help!
-Come back here!

04:45.827 --> 04:47.704
-Over here!
-Hey!

04:47.787 --> 04:49.247
-Where are you going?
-Over here!

04:49.330 --> 04:50.540
-Hey!
-Come back!

04:50.623 --> 04:52.542
-Over here!
-Help!

04:57.630 --> 04:59.966
-Hey!
-Why are you leaving?

05:02.260 --> 05:04.178
-Hey!
-We're still here!

05:04.262 --> 05:05.263
Where are you going?

05:08.308 --> 05:09.642
We're here…

05:12.729 --> 05:13.980
Fuck! Damn it.

05:16.274 --> 05:22.071
HYOSAN HIGH SCHOOL

05:39.797 --> 05:40.757
Mom…

05:56.147 --> 05:57.065
Mom…

06:37.021 --> 06:38.439
Fuck.

06:46.155 --> 06:47.240
He's gone.

06:47.865 --> 06:49.450
What the hell?

06:51.327 --> 06:53.246
-Who's gone?
-Gwi-nam.

06:55.873 --> 06:56.999
It's his smell.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.419
I hear his breathing too.

07:27.613 --> 07:29.615
HYOSAN HIGH SCHOOL

08:01.814 --> 08:04.692
What happened?
Didn't Gwi-nam fall from the fourth floor?

08:04.775 --> 08:05.902
He did. I threw him.

08:05.985 --> 08:07.737
So how did he survive?

08:08.321 --> 08:09.530
Look for ones with colors.

08:11.032 --> 08:14.118
Maybe he doesn't die.
Or maybe he dies and comes back to life.

08:15.119 --> 08:18.122
-It has to be visible from the sky.
-He's neither human nor zombie.

08:20.458 --> 08:22.543
Do you remember
that girl in the teachers' office?

08:22.627 --> 08:23.836
I'll kill you!

08:23.920 --> 08:26.339
Give it to me, fucker! I'll kill you!

08:29.091 --> 08:31.427
-She was weird too.
-Gwi-nam's like her, isn't he?

08:32.762 --> 08:33.638
I think so.

08:36.057 --> 08:37.391
Maybe Nam-ra is the same.

08:38.559 --> 08:39.852
What are you doing, Dae-su?

08:39.936 --> 08:40.937
Look I found an "O."

08:42.146 --> 08:44.774
That's what you found?

08:44.857 --> 08:45.816
She'll be fine.

08:46.442 --> 08:48.152
You can't guarantee what will happen.

08:49.987 --> 08:52.031
There's nothing we can guarantee
right now.

08:52.865 --> 08:54.909
We don't know if we'll live or die.

08:55.451 --> 08:56.869
Let's go make the SOS sign.

08:59.539 --> 09:00.498
Bare-su.

09:03.167 --> 09:06.003
If On-jo were like that,
could you just dump her?

09:06.587 --> 09:08.381
It's totally visible from up there.

09:15.304 --> 09:17.265
It came and left, didn't it? A chopper?

09:17.932 --> 09:18.808
Yes.

09:19.517 --> 09:22.186
Maybe they started the rescues.
Let's get to the rooftop.

09:22.770 --> 09:24.564
What if that's the end of the rescue?

09:24.647 --> 09:25.815
But it only came once.

09:26.691 --> 09:28.818
We don't know
whether or not it'll come back.

09:28.901 --> 09:30.736
I don't think we should go to the roof.

09:30.820 --> 09:33.406
If it comes back, will you take the blame?
What will you do then?

09:33.489 --> 09:34.615
-Nothing.
-Hey.

09:36.325 --> 09:38.160
We can't make it to the roof anyway.

09:39.453 --> 09:40.871
How can we carry him up there?

09:42.415 --> 09:43.291
Hey.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.752
-Just leave me and go.
-For real?

09:47.420 --> 09:49.380
Yes. You should just go.

09:50.006 --> 09:52.049
You mean it? You know how I am, don't you?

09:53.175 --> 09:54.552
I'll leave you.

09:55.261 --> 09:56.512
Should we?

09:57.054 --> 09:57.930
Should we not?

09:59.140 --> 10:00.683
Don't act tough.

10:00.766 --> 10:03.352
There's a ton of tough bastards outside.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.605
I won't die from this, will I?

10:07.148 --> 10:08.649
Fuck, I don't know.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.819
Anyway, we should put up
a sign or something.

10:11.902 --> 10:14.155
How would anyone know
we're in here and save us?

10:14.238 --> 10:17.199
Doesn't this building have a rooftop?
There's no way up there?

10:18.326 --> 10:19.744
They'll see us up there.

10:19.827 --> 10:22.538
Well, there is a ladder
that leads to the roof, but--

10:22.622 --> 10:24.415
Right? There is, right? Where is it?

10:24.498 --> 10:25.750
-Outside.
-Outside?

10:25.833 --> 10:26.792
Yes, outside.

10:30.212 --> 10:31.297
You fucker. Come here.

10:31.380 --> 10:33.257
-What? Why?
-You bastard.

10:33.341 --> 10:35.009
-What? Outside?
-Sorry!

10:35.092 --> 10:36.344
Get back here. Fuck.

10:36.427 --> 10:37.803
Stay back!

10:37.887 --> 10:40.473
-Let me throw you out for five seconds!
-Help!

10:40.556 --> 10:41.432
This is too big.

10:41.515 --> 10:42.558
How about this?

10:43.142 --> 10:44.685
-Break it apart.
-Here's a big one.

10:44.769 --> 10:46.020
How's this?

10:46.103 --> 10:47.813
Not that one. Put it down.

10:47.897 --> 10:48.981
Not this?

10:49.065 --> 10:51.442
-Gather anything big and colorful.
-Can I take this?

10:51.525 --> 10:53.778
Joon-yeong, go up there and look.

10:54.612 --> 10:55.613
Hey, be careful.

10:57.907 --> 10:58.866
How does it look?

10:58.949 --> 11:00.910
-First…
-Yes.

11:00.993 --> 11:02.286
The "O" is a bit narrow.

11:02.370 --> 11:05.122
He said the "O" is too narrow.
Dae-su, hand me that long one.

11:05.748 --> 11:08.084
It should be much bigger than this.

11:09.043 --> 11:10.419
Nam-ra, can you carry this?

11:11.754 --> 11:14.382
-Guys, keep it up.
-That goes over there.

11:14.465 --> 11:15.341
It goes like this.

11:15.424 --> 11:17.176
And the "S" is too short.

11:17.259 --> 11:18.928
-Get more of these.
-Is this enough?

11:19.011 --> 11:21.430
Fill that spot too. That's it.

11:21.514 --> 11:22.807
I got this part.

11:24.058 --> 11:25.309
They're too tight.

11:25.393 --> 11:26.727
Spread them out.

11:26.811 --> 11:28.104
Let's put it all away.

11:28.187 --> 11:30.523
Come take a look. We did a good job.

11:31.524 --> 11:34.610
-Look.
-You can't miss it.

11:35.820 --> 11:37.279
-We did do a good job.
-Right?

11:41.867 --> 11:43.953
It seems a little crooked.

11:44.036 --> 11:45.538
And the "S" is kind of short.

11:45.621 --> 11:46.497
Hope is…

11:47.498 --> 11:51.794
the cruelest torture
that prevents you from giving up on life.

12:02.430 --> 12:06.434
REALTY

12:14.442 --> 12:18.195
WOOGYEONG GIRLS' MIDDLE SCHOOL

12:18.279 --> 12:19.280
HYOSAN ARTS CENTER

12:20.740 --> 12:24.243
I can't think of anything else,
but I can't stop either.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.123
MYEONHAK-DONG

12:30.374 --> 12:32.168
HYOSAN HIGH SCHOOL

12:44.096 --> 12:47.016
Once body temperature rose,
the white blood cells were activated.

12:47.892 --> 12:51.103
But they were absorbed by the virus
and turned into a different virus.

13:09.497 --> 13:10.331
Gently.

13:15.544 --> 13:16.587
You'll draw the zombies.

13:21.175 --> 13:22.301
Bite down.

13:24.386 --> 13:25.429
Good job. All done.

13:33.020 --> 13:34.939
It isn't broken,

13:36.106 --> 13:38.609
so it'll get better soon
if you leave it like this.

13:39.944 --> 13:41.028
Thank you, detective.

13:42.196 --> 13:45.157
No need for formalities.
Just call me Jae-ik.

13:45.741 --> 13:46.617
Okay, Jae-ik.

13:47.201 --> 13:49.662
Since we're comfortable
with each other now,

13:49.745 --> 13:51.372
may I speak frankly?

13:51.455 --> 13:53.082
Yes, of course. Speak freely.

13:53.165 --> 13:54.250
Okay.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.502
-You crazy idiot. You stupid moron.
-What…

13:57.086 --> 13:59.463
You fucking came here
just to shoot some Internet show?

13:59.547 --> 14:01.715
You're a total moron.

14:01.799 --> 14:04.885
What? Subscribe and like?
Do you like that more than your life?

14:04.969 --> 14:06.929
You're a crazy asshole.

14:08.347 --> 14:09.306
I'm sorry, detective.

14:09.390 --> 14:12.142
Don't call me detective.
I said to call me by my name.

14:12.226 --> 14:13.269
It's fine, detective.

14:13.352 --> 14:16.647
If you were my brother,
you wouldn't need to worry about zombies.

14:16.730 --> 14:18.357
I'd beat you to death right here.

14:19.108 --> 14:22.945
But someone must uncover the truth
and let the world know, detective.

14:23.028 --> 14:24.697
What? The truth?

14:25.322 --> 14:27.700
Hey. Are you a journalist?

14:27.783 --> 14:28.659
Come on.

14:29.243 --> 14:31.996
Journalists don't dig to find the truth.

14:32.079 --> 14:34.081
That's why people like me
must step in, detective.

14:34.164 --> 14:36.458
Seriously. You and that mouth of yours.

14:37.418 --> 14:38.252
Right.

14:38.878 --> 14:42.464
It looked like your colleague dumped you
and took off.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.425
Should I blast him on my show?

14:44.508 --> 14:46.385
I can even interview you if you want.

14:47.136 --> 14:49.972
-Forget it.
-You should take revenge on traitors.

14:50.055 --> 14:50.931
Look.

14:51.724 --> 14:54.059
I learned from
my long experience as a detective.

14:54.143 --> 14:55.853
Assholes fighting to stay alive

14:55.936 --> 14:58.647
and coming at you
hoping to die are impossible to beat.

14:59.565 --> 15:01.025
I'm just worried about the kids.

15:02.359 --> 15:06.030
I have a pretty good number of followers.
I can end him socially for good.

15:06.113 --> 15:07.281
Oysterubbish.

15:07.364 --> 15:08.866
Orangibberish. Not Oysterubbish.

15:08.949 --> 15:12.953
Who gives a shit? Stop gibberishing
and gather everything we can throw.

15:13.746 --> 15:14.663
What? Why?

15:14.747 --> 15:17.207
Why else? It's crazy hot up here.

15:17.291 --> 15:19.043
You want to become human jerky?

15:19.126 --> 15:21.754
Why is everyone I meet like this?

15:28.385 --> 15:29.845
They're not moving.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.932
No. They follow sounds.

15:33.641 --> 15:34.725
Keep handing them over.

15:44.735 --> 15:45.611
What are you doing?

15:46.403 --> 15:48.280
You said you'd clear them out,
not lure them.

15:48.364 --> 15:51.200
They followed sounds earlier.

15:51.742 --> 15:53.535
What the hell? Give me one more.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.329
Stop it. More keep coming.

15:55.412 --> 15:56.914
I said to give it to me, asshole.

15:57.414 --> 15:59.291
-I ought to just…
-It's weird.

16:06.924 --> 16:08.926
MUNPYEONG DAYCARE

16:12.513 --> 16:13.472
Oh God.

16:15.432 --> 16:16.266
Oh my God.

16:19.103 --> 16:19.937
Sir!

16:20.020 --> 16:21.772
-You traitor!
-Traitor.

16:24.024 --> 16:26.110
Jump! Jump on top of the bus!

16:26.193 --> 16:27.569
Jump down!

16:27.653 --> 16:28.988
I got it, asshole. Shut up.

16:29.071 --> 16:30.364
-Let's go.
-What?

16:31.323 --> 16:33.200
-I said let's go!
-But…

16:38.247 --> 16:40.082
Goddamn it.

16:43.043 --> 16:44.670
Fuck. That was close.

16:44.753 --> 16:46.338
Hey. Jump.

16:46.422 --> 16:48.507
What? I can't jump.

16:48.590 --> 16:50.342
Don't give me that bullshit. Jump.

16:50.426 --> 16:51.760
I hurt my leg!

16:51.844 --> 16:52.886
I know. Jump!

16:52.970 --> 16:55.931
You should've taken me with you.
Why did you jump first?

16:56.015 --> 16:58.851
-How would I do that, you moron? Jump!
-My leg hurts.

16:58.934 --> 17:01.186
Do you want to die there
or break your leg here?

17:01.270 --> 17:02.813
This is nuts.

17:02.896 --> 17:04.064
-Jump!
-But my leg hurts.

17:04.148 --> 17:05.983
-You want to die?
-What about my leg?

17:06.066 --> 17:07.818
-Se-bin.
-Yes?

17:07.901 --> 17:09.820
Close your eyes and keep them shut.

17:09.903 --> 17:11.280
Hurry up, will you?

17:11.363 --> 17:12.239
Let's just go!

17:12.322 --> 17:13.991
-I'll catch you.
-No, I can't!

17:14.074 --> 17:15.868
Hey! Wait! Hold on!

17:16.577 --> 17:18.078
Jump, asshole!

17:18.162 --> 17:20.122
Damn it. Hold on. Okay.

17:20.205 --> 17:21.331
Hold on. Wait.

17:21.415 --> 17:24.376
Just leave him!
Can we get going, for God's sake?

17:24.460 --> 17:25.335
Aim for here.

17:25.419 --> 17:27.588
-Shit.
-What the hell are you doing?

17:29.631 --> 17:32.134
Oh no! Wait! Help me, detective!

17:32.217 --> 17:35.471
I mean, Jae-ik. Pull me up.
Please save me. Please.

17:37.681 --> 17:38.849
All clear!

17:38.932 --> 17:40.434
Here we go, sir!

17:40.517 --> 17:42.061
Let's go, Ho-seong!

17:43.062 --> 17:46.440
Wait. Okay, go.

17:55.741 --> 17:58.410
-What does SOS mean?
-It's a distress signal.

17:58.494 --> 18:01.080
I know that. But what does it stand for?

18:01.163 --> 18:04.291
It doesn't stand for anything.
SOS is just SOS.

18:04.374 --> 18:05.918
That makes no sense.

18:06.710 --> 18:08.587
That's just how it is. It has no meaning.

18:08.670 --> 18:10.881
Wait. Rescue quickly…

18:14.843 --> 18:16.512
Why'd you ask
if you don't even believe me?

18:16.595 --> 18:18.097
I thought you'd know.

18:18.680 --> 18:21.016
I do know.
Look it up. You'll see I'm right.

18:21.642 --> 18:24.061
Whatever. How can I look it up?
I don't have my phone.

18:24.895 --> 18:25.729
What's wrong?

18:27.147 --> 18:30.109
I asked On-jo what SOS meant,

18:30.651 --> 18:32.319
but she said it has no meaning.

18:33.779 --> 18:34.905
Just say you don't know.

18:34.988 --> 18:36.198
It's true.

18:36.281 --> 18:37.741
It's true.

18:37.825 --> 18:40.327
-It is?
-Yes. She's right.

18:40.994 --> 18:42.538
Why don't you believe her?

18:43.330 --> 18:44.206
Hey, Prez.

18:45.457 --> 18:46.333
What does SOS mean?

18:46.416 --> 18:48.001
Why, that--

18:48.085 --> 18:49.086
Forget it. Let him be.

18:50.546 --> 18:51.588
No meaning?

18:51.672 --> 18:52.756
Is it true?

18:54.424 --> 18:55.259
What?

18:55.759 --> 18:59.179
SOS doesn't mean anything?
It's not an acronym?

19:00.597 --> 19:02.474
-You don't believe me?
-No.

19:05.352 --> 19:07.354
The sun's about to set.
Let's start a fire.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.107
Hey.

19:13.902 --> 19:15.195
The sun's going to set.

19:16.405 --> 19:17.781
I think it's working.

19:20.284 --> 19:21.326
Next.

19:21.410 --> 19:23.245
-Already?
-Next.

19:23.912 --> 19:24.997
Let's do this.

19:31.879 --> 19:33.797
You'll get tired. Slow down.

19:33.881 --> 19:36.008
The fire won't start if he does it slowly.

19:36.508 --> 19:39.261
Do it faster.
Come on. Faster. Twist it faster.

19:39.344 --> 19:40.637
-Faster!
-Please.

19:41.722 --> 19:42.806
Did it cramp up?

19:43.557 --> 19:46.185
-My palms. I can't do it.
-I'll do it. Step back.

19:59.781 --> 20:00.699
Should we kill him?

20:01.867 --> 20:02.701
Are you praying?

20:03.827 --> 20:05.829
Don't pray. Rub…

20:05.913 --> 20:06.747
Get lost.

20:07.664 --> 20:08.957
It's hard. It won't work.

20:13.337 --> 20:14.713
Isn't that smoke?

20:14.796 --> 20:16.048
-Hey. Smoke.
-Smoke!

20:16.131 --> 20:17.090
-Su-hyeok.
-Hold on.

20:17.174 --> 20:18.133
-Please. Come on.
-Blow.

20:18.926 --> 20:20.302
Blow. Blow on it already!

20:20.385 --> 20:21.887
-Be careful.
-Blow.

20:21.970 --> 20:23.889
Did it catch on fire? Su-hyeok?

20:24.514 --> 20:26.767
-Please. I'm begging you.
-Fuck.

20:26.850 --> 20:28.185
Shit.

20:31.313 --> 20:32.231
I'll do it.

20:39.404 --> 20:41.031
-Hey.
-Do it faster.

20:42.115 --> 20:42.950
Hey.

20:47.329 --> 20:48.747
Use this.

20:53.377 --> 20:55.087
I smoke.

21:01.718 --> 21:02.844
You had that all along…

21:05.264 --> 21:06.348
You don't want it?

21:09.893 --> 21:10.894
Light it.

21:10.978 --> 21:13.689
MUNPYEONG DAYCARE

21:23.782 --> 21:25.242
Traitor.

21:25.325 --> 21:26.326
Traitor.

21:26.410 --> 21:28.370
I came back and saved you.

21:28.453 --> 21:31.039
You abandoned me and fled by yourself.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.250
I found this bus and came back for you.

21:33.875 --> 21:36.003
Seriously, man.
You need to use your brain.

21:36.086 --> 21:37.129
What did you…

21:37.921 --> 21:40.674
-Do you have a license to drive a bus?
-No.

21:40.757 --> 21:41.758
I have a regular license.

21:41.842 --> 21:46.054
I'll bust you once we get there.
Starting with driving without a license--

21:50.684 --> 21:53.103
What was that? It's a zombie, isn't it?

21:53.186 --> 21:55.480
Since when do zombies ride bikes?

21:55.564 --> 21:57.524
-Dumbass. Hey, Oyster.
-Orange.

21:57.607 --> 21:58.650
Take the baby.

21:58.734 --> 21:59.860
Careful.

21:59.943 --> 22:00.986
Be careful.

22:01.945 --> 22:02.779
Open the door.

22:03.780 --> 22:04.740
Seriously?

22:08.535 --> 22:10.620
You're dead if you betray me again.

22:10.704 --> 22:12.164
If I turn, I'll only go after you.

22:12.247 --> 22:14.708
-I'll bite only your neck. Got it?
-Okay.

22:19.546 --> 22:20.422
Oh my goodness.

22:23.300 --> 22:24.301
Hey.

22:25.427 --> 22:26.636
Are you okay?

22:29.556 --> 22:32.017
You weren't bitten or anything, right?

22:33.393 --> 22:34.644
You're okay, right?

22:36.521 --> 22:37.481
I'm fine.

22:39.858 --> 22:41.777
Come with us. I'm a cop.

22:44.696 --> 22:45.947
Hey!

22:48.533 --> 22:49.951
Mister!

22:50.035 --> 22:50.952
It's okay!

22:51.036 --> 22:52.954
The soldiers are here. They're soldiers.

22:54.164 --> 22:55.582
We're saved!

22:56.792 --> 22:57.709
What was that?

23:02.964 --> 23:03.924
Hey!

23:04.007 --> 23:04.883
Don't shoot!

23:04.966 --> 23:07.469
I'm a cop. Hold on. I'm a cop.

23:07.552 --> 23:09.805
Don't shoot! Here!

23:10.931 --> 23:15.727
Chin down. Extend your left arm.
Don't stick out your chest too much.

23:17.729 --> 23:18.897
This is so damn sexy.

23:21.942 --> 23:24.778
-What's with the face?
-Don't bother if that's your mindset.

23:24.861 --> 23:27.239
Stop being cocky
about shooting some stupid arrows.

23:31.743 --> 23:32.869
Hey. Why did I miss?

23:32.953 --> 23:34.287
Did you think it was easy?

23:35.372 --> 23:36.790
Anything is easier than studying.

23:36.873 --> 23:39.584
You get into Seoul University
if you're in the top 100.

23:39.668 --> 23:41.503
But if we're 100th in the country,

23:42.504 --> 23:43.505
we can't go anywhere.

23:44.172 --> 23:47.634
We can't make the national team,
get into college or a corporate team.

23:49.136 --> 23:50.679
There's nothing we can do.

23:50.762 --> 23:53.348
Everyone knows
you'll make the national team.

23:54.057 --> 23:56.435
You'll go to college
just by shooting arrows so stop whining.

23:58.353 --> 23:59.688
Damn it.

24:06.486 --> 24:07.696
Did you not?

24:08.321 --> 24:11.032
You didn't make the national team?
You can't go to college?

24:25.672 --> 24:28.049
You won't die if you don't go to college.

24:31.219 --> 24:32.888
I really like shooting arrows.

24:35.432 --> 24:37.058
All I did was archery.

24:38.727 --> 24:40.604
I don't know how to do anything else.

24:42.105 --> 24:43.398
As long I can keep doing it,

24:43.482 --> 24:46.193
I don't care whether I go to college
or join a corporate team.

24:48.153 --> 24:49.070
But now

24:50.780 --> 24:52.782
there's nowhere for me to shoot arrows.

24:57.078 --> 24:58.371
I'm only 19.

25:00.749 --> 25:01.708
But I have no hope.

25:04.294 --> 25:06.838
If the zombies kill all the archers,

25:06.922 --> 25:08.673
you'll automatically make
the national team.

25:09.925 --> 25:12.719
Crazy bitch. You call that a consolation?

25:12.802 --> 25:14.054
It's hope.

25:14.721 --> 25:16.473
At least you have possibilities.

25:17.432 --> 25:20.018
It's impossible for me
to get into college even if I live.

25:20.101 --> 25:21.228
The CSAT? Fuck it.

25:22.395 --> 25:24.064
My answers are always C or D.

25:24.856 --> 25:26.066
Why C or D?

25:27.442 --> 25:29.319
I pick C if I'm not sure
and D if I'm clueless.

25:30.695 --> 25:33.073
I swear it's like
I avoid all the right answers.

25:36.034 --> 25:39.162
Enough whining.
Teach me how to shoot arrows.

25:39.871 --> 25:42.582
Even if I suck,
it's better than you shooting alone.

25:57.597 --> 25:58.515
Dae-su.

25:59.391 --> 26:00.267
Yes?

26:01.309 --> 26:02.435
How was your audition?

26:03.937 --> 26:05.355
They told me to lose weight.

26:08.358 --> 26:09.442
You're a good singer.

26:10.860 --> 26:13.029
Sing for us. I want to hear it.

26:13.697 --> 26:15.824
Forget it. I don't want to sing.

26:16.908 --> 26:18.618
I really like that song.

26:20.495 --> 26:21.329
You do?

26:21.413 --> 26:22.581
Yes.

26:22.664 --> 26:23.665
Really?

26:23.748 --> 26:24.666
It's really nice.

26:26.543 --> 26:27.377
You sing well.

26:28.295 --> 26:29.254
It'll cheer us up.

26:31.840 --> 26:35.468
Let's go once it's over

26:36.636 --> 26:41.016
Let's go anywhere

26:42.017 --> 26:45.186
Once we're done studying 12 hours a day

26:45.937 --> 26:48.523
Once the annoying sounds are over

26:49.024 --> 26:52.861
Let's go hand in hand

26:53.486 --> 26:57.324
Let's not run

26:57.907 --> 27:01.661
Let's try walking slowly

27:02.746 --> 27:09.628
Is that drool or sweat pooled on the book?

27:09.711 --> 27:11.463
No one notices the plop, plop

27:11.546 --> 27:13.673
The plop, plop

27:13.757 --> 27:17.594
The falling rain drops

27:18.094 --> 27:22.015
What is boiling? Simmer, simmer

27:22.098 --> 27:26.102
It's Mom's doenjang stew

27:27.228 --> 27:30.398
A bowl of instant noodles

27:30.482 --> 27:34.611
In front of the TV
Which plays nothing but static

27:35.779 --> 27:40.867
Let's go anywhere together

28:02.389 --> 28:05.809
I have to get to the rooftop, damn it.

29:49.579 --> 29:50.580
…but the cops

29:51.998 --> 29:53.583
and firefighters never came.

29:54.250 --> 29:56.377
If anyone sees this later,

29:58.254 --> 29:59.214
please punish

30:00.882 --> 30:02.258
everyone who should have come.

30:02.926 --> 30:05.553
I'm fine. The kids are really good to me.

30:06.054 --> 30:07.555
Want to see them?

30:11.226 --> 30:12.060
Mom.

30:12.727 --> 30:14.145
I want a raise in my allowance.

30:15.980 --> 30:16.856
Here.

30:17.482 --> 30:18.942
-Is it ready to go?
-Yes.

30:21.194 --> 30:24.864
Music and lyrics
by intergalactic superstar Yang Dae-su.

30:26.366 --> 30:30.078
Chicken tastes better fried in olive oil

30:30.161 --> 30:33.832
Pork tastes better than soy meat

30:33.915 --> 30:37.418
What makes me laugh, laugh, laugh

30:37.502 --> 30:41.297
Is trans fat

30:41.381 --> 30:42.340
I'm hungry.

30:42.423 --> 30:45.134
How can you sing right now?

30:45.218 --> 30:48.596
Isn't everyone leaving a final message?

30:49.639 --> 30:51.140
Why is it final? Are we dying?

30:54.185 --> 30:55.395
Hello.

30:55.478 --> 30:58.064
I'm Oh Joon-yeong, class of '23
at Seoul University Business School.

30:58.565 --> 31:00.149
I'll meet you soon, upperclassmen.

31:00.233 --> 31:04.320
And once I'm there,
I want to get a girlfriend.

31:04.404 --> 31:05.613
No, you can't.

31:06.239 --> 31:07.323
What the hell?

31:09.909 --> 31:10.743
Mom.

31:11.911 --> 31:12.745
It's me.

31:13.830 --> 31:15.248
Dad, you're okay too, right?

31:17.542 --> 31:20.461
Mom. Listen. Don't freak out, okay?

31:22.672 --> 31:24.966
You're the only person
I can share this with.

31:26.301 --> 31:27.760
Gyeong-su's dead, Mom.

31:30.555 --> 31:31.973
Because I called him over.

31:35.518 --> 31:37.854
I did it
in case he'd bite the others, but…

31:39.981 --> 31:41.691
it's my fault he died.

31:46.988 --> 31:50.450
Please let his grandma know.

31:53.369 --> 31:55.413
Put it gently so it doesn't shock her…

31:57.123 --> 31:58.207
too much.

32:03.963 --> 32:06.716
Gyeong-su wanted to work part-time
at our restaurant.

32:09.928 --> 32:13.264
But I said no because he'd try
to eat free chicken every day.

32:17.310 --> 32:19.062
I should have just let him.

32:30.448 --> 32:37.413
PTA DONATIONS

32:43.586 --> 32:44.837
You killed him.

32:44.921 --> 32:47.548
You wiped that blood
with your handkerchief.

32:47.632 --> 32:49.884
You rubbed that
on Gyeong-su's wound, right?

32:50.677 --> 32:52.053
Like his blood is clean?

32:52.929 --> 32:54.055
He became a zombie.

32:55.682 --> 32:57.308
Nam-ra, that's enough.

32:57.392 --> 33:01.437
It's true. Na-yeon killed Gyeong-su.

33:01.521 --> 33:03.690
-Calm down.
-How could you--

33:03.773 --> 33:05.108
Why did you kill him?

33:06.401 --> 33:09.612
You're… a murderer.

33:26.629 --> 33:29.132
-Leave.
-You killed me.

33:30.299 --> 33:31.676
Leave.

33:31.759 --> 33:33.094
Please leave.

33:33.928 --> 33:35.304
You killed me.

34:04.083 --> 34:05.376
What a nice song.

34:06.377 --> 34:07.587
You said it sucked.

34:08.880 --> 34:11.340
Now that I actually listened to it,
I think it's nice.

34:12.133 --> 34:13.760
That was encouraging, Dae-su.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.057
When did you

34:20.433 --> 34:21.893
start smoking?

34:24.270 --> 34:25.730
Since the eighth grade.

34:26.481 --> 34:29.400
I had no friends
and no outlet to relieve stress.

34:35.031 --> 34:37.241
Did you ever need a friend?

34:38.326 --> 34:39.285
I'm not sure.

34:40.536 --> 34:41.871
I can't tell.

34:44.832 --> 34:46.626
You always put up a wall.

34:49.045 --> 34:51.589
You always wore earphones
and never said a word.

34:54.425 --> 34:56.302
Wasn't it because you didn't like us?

35:07.814 --> 35:09.565
I never disliked you guys.

35:12.860 --> 35:13.778
I just…

35:16.531 --> 35:18.241
didn't have any friends.

35:19.700 --> 35:20.618
To be honest,

35:22.036 --> 35:24.497
I didn't like you.

35:28.709 --> 35:32.088
Because I thought you didn't talk to us
because we were beneath you.

35:33.214 --> 35:34.048
To be honest,

35:35.716 --> 35:38.177
there were times
when I wished you weren't around.

35:40.513 --> 35:43.683
Aren't you two close?
You're the top two students in our school.

35:43.766 --> 35:45.143
That's why I hated her.

35:45.726 --> 35:47.645
No matter how hard I tried,
I was always second.

35:49.522 --> 35:50.690
But it's okay now.

35:52.316 --> 35:55.111
I think I was able
to come in second thanks to Nam-ra.

35:57.738 --> 35:59.949
Hey. Second place is good too.

36:01.576 --> 36:04.495
I can't even come in 20th
in our class. Right?

36:05.580 --> 36:06.873
Hey.

36:07.748 --> 36:09.625
Don't compare yourself to Joon-yeong.

36:09.709 --> 36:11.961
I was just saying.

36:12.044 --> 36:14.714
Why do you always jump down my throat
when I say something?

36:17.466 --> 36:19.260
Do you like me?

36:20.678 --> 36:22.346
Screw you.

36:23.764 --> 36:25.975
I'll put it out there
so you don't get hurt.

36:27.185 --> 36:28.603
I like someone else.

36:29.270 --> 36:30.396
So don't like me.

36:30.479 --> 36:32.899
I don't like you.

36:32.982 --> 36:35.151
I'm not interested at all.

36:35.234 --> 36:37.445
Dae-su. Who do you like?

36:37.528 --> 36:39.488
He's a total freak.

36:41.532 --> 36:43.743
-His sister.
-Ha-ri from Archery?

36:44.327 --> 36:45.912
You're insane.

36:45.995 --> 36:47.622
I go crazy when I'm in love.

36:48.289 --> 36:51.125
She's like Cupid in my eyes.

36:51.209 --> 36:52.752
Stop it.

36:52.835 --> 36:55.755
If we get out of here alive,
I'll tell my sister.

36:56.505 --> 36:57.590
Will you really?

36:57.673 --> 36:58.591
-Yes.
-About what?

36:58.674 --> 36:59.800
To shoot and kill you.

37:00.426 --> 37:01.761
I said not to like my sister.

37:01.844 --> 37:05.681
-Brother-in-law. You can't do that to me.
-You hog.

37:05.765 --> 37:07.225
-Will you tell her?
-To kill you.

37:07.308 --> 37:10.478
-Don't do that. Seriously. I love her.
-Stop it.

37:20.863 --> 37:22.198
Gyeong-su…

38:19.880 --> 38:20.840
Ms. Park.

38:21.882 --> 38:22.758
It's Gyeong-su.

38:24.385 --> 38:26.470
They're all Gyeong-su.

38:27.138 --> 38:28.180
Na-yeon.

38:31.684 --> 38:34.478
You were scared.
So were the others. That's all.

38:35.688 --> 38:38.482
So make sure you go back to them later.

38:40.526 --> 38:44.405
Go to them and tell them…

38:46.407 --> 38:47.908
and tell Gyeong-su

38:49.243 --> 38:50.536
that you're sorry.

38:53.831 --> 38:54.790
Na-yeon.

38:56.375 --> 38:57.293
Stay alive.

38:59.253 --> 39:00.212
Stay alive…

39:03.966 --> 39:06.302
and help your friends.

39:08.679 --> 39:12.183
Do anything you can to help them--

39:31.744 --> 39:32.787
Na-yeon.

39:33.954 --> 39:36.791
It wasn't your fault.

39:37.750 --> 39:39.043
It was my fault.

39:42.171 --> 39:43.714
I'm sorry for cornering you.

39:57.186 --> 39:58.145
You…

39:59.730 --> 40:03.234
Na-yeon, you have to live.

41:11.760 --> 41:16.432
INSTRUMENT STORAGE

41:28.360 --> 41:31.906
My mom and dad
prepared everything for my transfer.

41:33.449 --> 41:34.992
They said to just go to Seoul.

41:37.244 --> 41:39.038
But I really didn't want to go.

41:43.000 --> 41:46.587
I wouldn't have any friends,
and I was afraid of Seoul kids.

41:48.339 --> 41:50.049
I didn't know what to do.

41:52.218 --> 41:54.595
Then On-jo gave me a great idea.

41:57.515 --> 41:59.391
She said to cut school for five days.

42:01.894 --> 42:04.063
Then the principal couldn't write
a recommendation.

42:05.981 --> 42:07.274
That's why I cut school.

42:10.569 --> 42:11.904
It's all thanks to On-jo…

42:14.240 --> 42:15.199
that I didn't transfer.

42:19.119 --> 42:20.746
But I should've just gone.

42:24.041 --> 42:26.335
Then this wouldn't have happened to me.

42:28.754 --> 42:30.089
My sister was told

42:31.298 --> 42:34.051
she was an archery prodigy
ever since she was a child.

42:36.470 --> 42:37.972
So our family only cared about

42:38.847 --> 42:41.350
whether or not she made it
onto the national team.

42:43.602 --> 42:45.062
They gave me no attention.

42:47.231 --> 42:49.191
I give you attention, brother-in-law.

42:50.025 --> 42:51.527
Don't be sad. You have me--

42:55.030 --> 42:56.365
Thank God I have Dae-su.

43:00.703 --> 43:03.664
I don't really have anything to say.

43:06.292 --> 43:07.793
I wouldn't really know…

43:10.254 --> 43:12.256
but I feel like I made friends.

43:29.648 --> 43:30.608
On-jo

43:32.359 --> 43:33.319
and I…

44:09.021 --> 44:10.064
What's that?

44:10.147 --> 44:12.566
-What are you doing here?
-Me?

44:15.027 --> 44:16.570
I have to go to the rooftop,

44:17.821 --> 44:19.156
but the door's locked.

44:22.493 --> 44:23.827
So I'm going to go that way.

44:26.830 --> 44:30.542
-You're not a zombie, right?
-Zombie? Fuck that.

44:35.756 --> 44:36.799
Is that food?

44:40.928 --> 44:41.804
Are you hungry?

44:44.264 --> 44:45.849
Are you?

44:47.184 --> 44:48.394
Are you hungry?

44:55.025 --> 44:55.859
Me too.

45:15.462 --> 45:16.922
I just…

45:18.048 --> 45:19.591
I just want some water.

45:19.675 --> 45:21.677
Not things like that.

45:22.761 --> 45:24.263
Be completely honest.

45:26.014 --> 45:28.767
Be completely honest. Do you like someone?

45:34.565 --> 45:37.568
-Yes.
-Really? You do?

45:43.991 --> 45:44.867
Yes.

45:46.785 --> 45:49.621
Why are you stalling? Is it a crush?

45:51.415 --> 45:52.708
Pretty much.

45:52.791 --> 45:54.793
Pretty much? What does that mean?

45:57.463 --> 45:58.464
Who is she?

46:08.599 --> 46:09.683
No one.

46:10.267 --> 46:11.435
Who is she?

46:12.102 --> 46:13.187
Do I know her?

46:15.397 --> 46:16.231
Who?

46:17.733 --> 46:18.734
You.

46:20.486 --> 46:21.487
You, On-jo.

46:23.405 --> 46:24.531
I like you.

46:28.911 --> 46:30.245
Hey. Stop that.

46:32.664 --> 46:35.501
He doesn't mean it. He's just kidding.

46:37.920 --> 46:41.298
We were friends and neighbors
since kindergarten, that's all.

46:44.802 --> 46:45.636
Stop joking.

46:47.721 --> 46:48.680
I'm not joking.

46:50.224 --> 46:52.559
I've liked you every day
for the past 12 years

46:53.560 --> 46:55.437
since we were six years old.

46:57.773 --> 46:59.149
And I'll continue to.

47:04.822 --> 47:05.697
Shocking.

47:26.134 --> 47:27.386
Cheong-san.

47:42.734 --> 47:46.780
-Did you know? I had no idea.
-You're the only one who didn't know.

47:47.614 --> 47:49.283
-Everyone knew?
-Yes.

47:50.492 --> 47:51.577
Why didn't I know?

47:51.660 --> 47:53.370
-I didn't either.
-Because you're you.

47:53.453 --> 47:54.621
Cheong-san's so cool.

48:02.170 --> 48:03.171
On-jo.

48:08.802 --> 48:09.636
I'm sorry.

48:12.806 --> 48:14.016
You don't have to like me.

48:14.099 --> 48:15.100
Stop.

48:15.183 --> 48:16.184
I'm done.

48:18.312 --> 48:20.063
I said it all, so it's all good.

48:20.731 --> 48:22.399
How is it all good? You jerk.

48:23.108 --> 48:25.235
You were my best friend.

48:28.155 --> 48:30.324
I-sak's gone, and you're gone.

48:33.952 --> 48:35.537
What do you want me to do?

49:11.281 --> 49:15.035
Have you… never liked me?

49:22.501 --> 49:23.669
Not even by mistake?

49:26.588 --> 49:28.006
Not even once?

49:32.844 --> 49:34.012
Would you please go away?

49:36.807 --> 49:38.183
I want to be alone.

49:41.770 --> 49:43.355
You don't have to like me.

51:03.310 --> 51:04.561
On-jo!

51:10.025 --> 51:11.568
-Cheong-san!
-What the hell?

51:17.616 --> 51:19.284
Give me your eye, asshole.

55:20.150 --> 55:22.652
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCATIONS, INSTITUTIONS,

55:22.736 --> 55:25.071
