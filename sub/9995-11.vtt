WEBVTT

00:04.100 --> 00:06.970
They say 40 is t new 3

00:07.480 --> 00:09.560
And I say they're right.

00:09.570 --> 00:15.550
I look young,I feel young,
and I act young, and frankly,

00:15.560 --> 00:19.600
most men my age can't begin to keep up.

00:19.610 --> 00:22.060
So where does a girl go?

00:22.070 --> 00:25.760
Where does she go to
find suitable playmates?

00:26.320 --> 00:29.900
Come on. I'm gonna show you.

00:31.430 --> 00:34.790
Amy and I were suppose||to get
married right after graduation.

00:35.440 --> 00:39.940
She'd already picked out
the dress,reserved the hall.

00:42.150 --> 00:45.100
Everybody says that it
must have been her time...

00:47.100 --> 00:50.360
but maybe it was the
drunk who hit her's time.

00:53.050 --> 00:55.170
It's been five months.

00:55.180 --> 00:57.260
I still can't sleep.

00:57.270 --> 00:59.840
Don't really eat.

01:00.040 --> 01:02.260
Don't really want to be with anybody.

01:02.280 --> 01:06.240
Other than this group, I mean.

01:11.400 --> 01:14.050
Five months without anybody?

01:14.550 --> 01:17.120
This is actually too simple.

01:19.000 --> 01:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:33.090 --> 01:35.640
I hope that answers your question.

01:36.020 --> 01:38.240
Completely.

01:38.600 --> 01:43.150
Fold-down rear seats--
I'm gonna get some.

01:44.150 --> 01:47.530
I think I forgot how
amazing that can be.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.660
You want to do it again?

01:53.190 --> 01:55.130
Now,this is the tough part.

01:55.140 --> 01:58.000
Remember,the goal here is to love 'em
and leave 'em, not keep loving 'em.

01:58.010 --> 02:02.330
I mean,how you going to move on
to your next young lover if...

02:02.340 --> 02:04.470
you're still with the last?

02:04.480 --> 02:09.820
So now that you got him where you want
him, the trick is to move in for the kill.

02:10.740 --> 02:15.410
See,that's what really separates
the cougars from the pussycats.

02:15.420 --> 02:18.000
You want to do it again?

02:18.510 --> 02:19.910
- How about that?
- That's nice.

02:19.920 --> 02:20.940
- Like this?
- Oh,yeah.

02:20.950 --> 02:22.970
- Like this?
- That feels good.

02:22.980 --> 02:24.790
- You like that?
- Yeah,that's good.

02:24.800 --> 02:28.140
That's nice. Yeah,that's good.

02:32.980 --> 02:34.790
Bad dream?

02:35.570 --> 02:37.630
It was weird.

02:38.660 --> 02:43.310
Just weird dream. Weird.

02:43.320 --> 02:47.500
This woman, she was behaving like...

02:47.510 --> 02:50.660
well,I don't know what
she was behaving like.

02:50.670 --> 02:52.840
She kept trying to get
these young guys into bed,

02:52.860 --> 02:55.800
and then when she was
through with them...

02:56.930 --> 03:01.740
Actually,she was
behaving just like a man.

03:05.100 --> 03:07.430
Okay. Sorry I asked.

03:55.170 --> 03:58.250
Girls,let's go. Breakfast time.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.030
Ariel?

04:01.650 --> 04:04.950
Don't do that. You do that too hard and
it'll go right through to your brain.

04:04.960 --> 04:07.350
My ear's itchy.

04:08.540 --> 04:10.690
I need your credit card for gas.

04:10.720 --> 04:12.440
I've got a meeting with
Devalos this morning.

04:22.580 --> 04:24.970
Police have not yet released
the name of the young man,

04:24.990 --> 04:28.650
whose body was found early this
morning in the back of his SUV,

04:28.660 --> 04:30.950
- which was in a downtown church parking lot.
- I'll be right back.I got to make a call.

04:30.960 --> 04:33.680
Coroner's figuring he died
last night around 11:00.

04:33.690 --> 04:34.800
You were right about his fiancée.

04:34.810 --> 04:37.270
She was killed by a drunk
driver six months ago.

04:37.280 --> 04:41.000
In fact,he was attending some kind of a
grief support meeting here at the church.

04:41.010 --> 04:47.140
Well,did anyone see him leave with the woman
I described: tall, very beautiful,early 40s?

04:47.150 --> 04:50.480
According to the others at the meeting,
no one there really fits that description.

04:50.490 --> 04:53.090
I saw her as plain as day.

04:53.100 --> 04:54.750
That's the thing,Allison.

04:54.760 --> 04:56.850
Whoever did this,there's
nothing womanly about her.

04:56.860 --> 05:00.010
It's pretty savage, kind
of bordering on butchery,

05:00.020 --> 05:02.370
and it's hard to imagine a
woman of any age with the anger,

05:02.390 --> 05:07.650
not to mention the strength, necessary
to hack this fellow up the way he was.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.520
Come in.

05:10.530 --> 05:12.500
Oh,sorry I'm late.

05:12.510 --> 05:13.750
Hey,come on in,Allison.

05:13.760 --> 05:15.720
You remember Ben, my campaign manager?

05:15.730 --> 05:17.270
Ben Salzberg. Allison Dubois.

05:17.280 --> 05:19.440
- We've met.
- I remember.

05:20.790 --> 05:24.420
"Manuel Devalos. An
Instinct for Justice."

05:24.430 --> 05:26.660
Well,you have my vote, Mr. Devalos.

05:26.670 --> 05:30.830
There's one. Okay Here,I
want to show you something.

05:31.440 --> 05:36.780
Mr. District Attorney, polls show Manuel Devalos is closing the gap on yourseven
- point lead.

05:36.790 --> 05:41.640
Do you have any comment about what's
being called the "Manuel Momentum"?

05:41.650 --> 05:46.350
The only person calling it the "Manuel
Momentum" is former District Attorney Devalos.

05:46.360 --> 05:49.710
Now,I'll admit his numbers look impressive,
given his late entrance into the race,

05:49.720 --> 05:53.240
but the citizens of Phoenix have
had enough of Manuel Devalos.

05:53.260 --> 05:54.870
They know what baggage
he brings with him.

05:54.880 --> 05:57.730
They know that when it comes to the
trying of fact in a court of law,

05:57.740 --> 06:02.190
you don't go to a witch doctor or
a fortune-teller for legal counsel.

06:02.210 --> 06:06.200
My intuition says the
voters aren't buying it.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.900
Thank you very much. Excuse me.

06:15.530 --> 06:17.740
Talk about "going negative."

06:17.750 --> 06:19.970
I didn't bring you here to upset you.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.700
Well,I appreciate that,sir.

06:21.710 --> 06:24.360
Mutual admiration aside,we've
called you here,Mrs. Dubois,

06:24.370 --> 06:27.970
because Manny has a very
important fund-raiser tomorrow.

06:27.980 --> 06:29.300
Say no more.

06:29.310 --> 06:31.870
I'll book a bus ticket
out of town if it'll help.

06:31.890 --> 06:33.960
I thought you said she was a psychic.

06:33.980 --> 06:35.290
You're misunderstanding, Allison.

06:35.300 --> 06:36.870
I don't want you to stay away.

06:36.880 --> 06:40.530
I want you there. Prominently.

06:40.540 --> 06:42.180
I don't understand.

06:42.190 --> 06:47.660
Manny's biggest problem and Van Dyke's
biggest asset is "the Allison question."

06:47.670 --> 06:50.500
Who is Allison Dubois? Where is she?

06:50.510 --> 06:53.050
If she's the real deal,
why is Manny hiding her?

06:53.060 --> 06:59.280
We've come to the conclusion that the best answer
for the Allison question is Allison herself.

07:00.080 --> 07:03.470
It's time for you to come
out of hiding,Mrs. Dubois.

07:04.920 --> 07:08.810
"The answer to the Allison
question is Allison herself"?

07:08.820 --> 07:10.420
He actually said that?

07:10.430 --> 07:12.070
So what? So now we got
to go to this thing?

07:12.080 --> 07:14.280
Well,what was I supposed to say?

07:14.300 --> 07:16.840
I don't know. Tell
him we got a sick kid.

07:19.520 --> 07:21.310
What?

07:21.320 --> 07:25.620
What are kids for if not to be used as excuses
to get out of things that you don't want to do?

07:25.630 --> 07:26.690
That's not funny.

07:26.710 --> 07:27.800
That's not even a little funny.

07:27.820 --> 07:29.320
If one of our girls gets sick now...

07:29.340 --> 07:31.970
Oh,please,one of our kids
is not going to get sick now.

07:31.980 --> 07:33.410
And it is too funny.

07:33.440 --> 07:35.120
Be quiet. I'm not listening.I'm asleep.

07:35.130 --> 07:38.160
No,you're laughing. You're
laughing on the inside.

07:38.170 --> 07:40.840
I can't hear you. I'm in dreamland.

07:40.850 --> 07:43.880
You want to keep your laughter
down,please? I'm trying to sleep.

07:48.070 --> 07:50.010
You going to want something
else? It's last call.

07:50.020 --> 07:52.000
No,thanks.

07:52.010 --> 07:53.910
I guess I've been stood up.

07:53.920 --> 07:56.240
Happens to the best of us.

07:56.880 --> 07:58.810
You know,he may still show.

07:58.820 --> 08:01.500
You got 20 minutes till closing.

08:02.760 --> 08:05.220
There's no one coming here to meet me.

08:05.230 --> 08:11.100
Fundamental truth: Hardworking young men
like the idea of seducing rich,older women.

08:11.110 --> 08:12.960
They think it's easy.

08:12.970 --> 08:18.250
They think we're desperate-- so desperate
we'll do whatever it takes to keep them happy.

08:19.580 --> 08:24.480
Little does he know I only
want him for the night.

08:24.490 --> 08:27.680
Glass ring,fake pearls.

08:27.690 --> 08:29.020
He's a man.

08:29.030 --> 08:31.850
He won't know the difference.

08:31.860 --> 08:34.669
How's that treating you?

08:34.690 --> 08:36.900
Good. Thanks.

08:36.909 --> 08:40.620
It's my fault,you know, that he
thinks he can treat me this way.

08:41.179 --> 08:45.220
I should never have bought him
that little sports car he wanted.

08:45.230 --> 08:49.270
Now he thinks he can just leave me here sitting,
waiting for him all night in a restaurant.

08:49.280 --> 08:52.030
He sounds like a fool.

08:52.040 --> 08:54.150
A blind fool.

08:54.180 --> 08:57.960
You're right. He is.

09:00.060 --> 09:02.600
Look,I got to ask you something.

09:02.620 --> 09:04.750
Well,go ahead. Hurry up.

09:04.760 --> 09:08.220
Only got 19 minutes before closing.

09:08.230 --> 09:12.230
How does a guy get to be
with a woman like you anyway?

09:12.600 --> 09:15.390
He asks.

09:30.010 --> 09:32.360
You're pretty amazing.

09:32.370 --> 09:35.670
Pretty and amazing, yeah.

09:35.680 --> 09:38.310
God did okay by you,too.

09:39.510 --> 09:42.900
Hey,I'm gonna,uh, pour myself
a drink. You want something?

09:43.470 --> 09:46.420
Whatever you're having,sure.

09:55.390 --> 09:58.690
This one actually makes me a little sad.

10:01.890 --> 10:04.330
He's so cute.

10:06.170 --> 10:11.080
I could see myself spending more
than just one night with him.

10:11.820 --> 10:14.180
But that would never work.

10:14.190 --> 10:16.860
He thinks I actually have money.

10:18.100 --> 10:20.260
Don't look so surprised.

10:20.270 --> 10:24.850
Any cougar worth her salt knows
a thing or two about nails.

10:27.150 --> 10:33.160
Hey,lover, you ever had your back
scratched by a woman who really knows how?

10:34.620 --> 10:38.130
Oh,come on. Don't be such a baby.

10:38.140 --> 10:40.580
You'll love it.

10:46.080 --> 10:48.630
Careful.She just fell asleep.
I don't want to wake her.

10:48.640 --> 10:50.050
Okay. Don't blame me.

10:50.060 --> 10:52.130
Blame Dr. Friedman.

10:52.140 --> 10:56.340
He's the one who's leaving town and told us
we've got to get to his office in half an hour.

10:57.980 --> 11:01.120
Hey,how many times you
think we've made this trip?

11:01.130 --> 11:02.430
I don't know,what?

11:02.440 --> 11:06.190
The early morning ear
infection/antibiotic run? I don't know.

11:06.200 --> 11:09.220
Together or separate...

11:12.050 --> 11:14.430
Hey,what street was that?

11:15.900 --> 11:17.500
24th,I think.

11:17.510 --> 11:20.750
Let me use your phone. I've
got to call Detective Scanlon.

11:32.220 --> 11:34.150
Detective Lee Scanlon, Phoenix PD.

11:34.160 --> 11:39.640
I,uh,I got an anonymous tip|| there might have
been some trouble here in the restaurant last night.

11:47.150 --> 11:50.180
Well,looks okay to me.

12:17.890 --> 12:20.400
Okay,I give up.

12:24.750 --> 12:27.780
Come on,Allison.

12:35.730 --> 12:40.770
Hello? Lee,is that you?Hello?

12:40.780 --> 12:43.930
Uh,I'm gonna... I'm
gonna call you back,okay?

12:43.940 --> 12:46.370
What's going on?

12:50.300 --> 12:52.700
**********

13:10.300 --> 13:12.900
Victim's name is Ryan
Haas, 26 years old.

13:12.910 --> 13:16.220
Been working at this restaurant
for four years as a bartender.

13:16.230 --> 13:21.210
The manager said,uh, Ryan offered to
close up last night after his shift ended.

13:21.220 --> 13:24.680
Didn't say anything about
him,uh,having a date.

13:24.690 --> 13:27.620
Anyone remember the woman at the bar?

13:28.090 --> 13:29.950
This place is kind of a pickup joint.

13:29.960 --> 13:31.630
Ryan was a flirt.

13:31.640 --> 13:35.170
The manager says there's always girls hanging
around the bar till closing, but no one they noticed.

13:35.180 --> 13:37.380
Well,that doesn't make sense.
This woman is beautiful.

13:37.390 --> 13:39.780
She was,uh... sexy.

13:39.790 --> 13:42.200
She's not the kind of woman
who would go unnoticed.

13:42.210 --> 13:44.570
Well,she did last night,
if she even exists.

13:44.580 --> 13:46.070
What does that mean?

13:46.080 --> 13:48.720
Allison,this guy was
killed with a nail gun.

13:48.730 --> 13:49.400
So?

13:49.410 --> 13:52.490
So how many women you
know have a nail gun?

13:52.500 --> 13:55.210
Much less the strength to overpower
a 26-year-old man long enough

13:55.220 --> 14:00.410
to drive a couple hundred six-penny
nails into his head, his neck,his chest...

14:00.420 --> 14:02.110
This isn't about strength.

14:02.120 --> 14:04.720
It's just like that guy that got
lured into the back of his van

14:04.730 --> 14:06.700
and stabbed to death the other night.

14:06.710 --> 14:09.120
She seduces them, she has sex with them,

14:09.130 --> 14:12.050
and then when their defenses are down
and they're vulnerable, then she strikes.

14:12.060 --> 14:13.280
I want to see that movie.

14:13.290 --> 14:15.580
You know,I'm not even convinced
these two murders are related.

14:15.600 --> 14:17.650
Well,they are.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.820
So you're telling me that there's
a female serial killer out there,

14:20.830 --> 14:22.270
picking up men and then murdering them.

14:22.280 --> 14:23.730
That's what I'm saying.

14:23.740 --> 14:27.250
I guess I should be grateful I'm
not out there on the prowl anymore.

14:27.260 --> 14:31.280
Relax,stud. You're about ten
years too old for this black widow.

14:32.050 --> 14:34.870
You look pretty.

14:35.340 --> 14:38.140
Thanks,sugar. So do you.

14:40.550 --> 14:43.090
Mama has to go out.

14:43.100 --> 14:46.950
I don't want to, but I promised
someone I'd do something for them.

14:48.610 --> 14:50.500
How do you feel?

14:50.510 --> 14:52.320
It still hurts.

14:53.240 --> 14:57.670
You know Daddy and Ariel and Bridgette are
all going to be here to take care of you,

14:57.680 --> 15:02.180
and I'll be back home
before you know it,okay?

15:08.690 --> 15:12.020
"I" before "E," except after "C."

15:12.040 --> 15:15.040
Can't you just tell me how to spell it?

15:16.100 --> 15:20.810
Uh,Dad,I think you're in trouble, 'cause
Mom's all dressed up and you're not.

15:21.420 --> 15:24.450
No,honey. Daddy's staying home with you.

15:24.460 --> 15:26.550
It's okay. You can take him if you want.

15:26.560 --> 15:29.320
He's being kind of grouchy anyways.

15:29.330 --> 15:34.410
You know,the whole point of "the kid is
sick" excuse is to get us both out of going.

15:34.420 --> 15:35.700
Yeah,I'll remember that next time.

15:35.710 --> 15:39.980
Hey,don't forget to wake her up at
9:30 for her last dose of medicine,okay?

15:40.430 --> 15:43.010
Come on,grouchy.

15:48.770 --> 15:50.360
Allison.

15:50.370 --> 15:51.920
It's so great you're here.

15:51.930 --> 15:54.170
Don't be silly. What a terrific turnout.

15:54.180 --> 15:56.730
It's going very well, lots
of press,lots of donors,

15:56.740 --> 16:02.050
a few big fish we still need to haul
into the boa|| And here comes Shamu now.

16:02.190 --> 16:03.510
How are you?

16:03.520 --> 16:05.530
Constance,I'm so pleased
you could make it.

16:05.540 --> 16:06.870
Mr. District Attorney.

16:06.890 --> 16:08.230
I don't see Richard.

16:08.250 --> 16:10.370
Oh,he's running late.
Some business thing.

16:10.380 --> 16:12.860
Constance,have you met Mrs. Dubois?

16:12.880 --> 16:15.080
Allison Dubois,this is Constance Madsen.

16:15.090 --> 16:16.100
Nice to meet you.

16:16.120 --> 16:19.550
Oh,my... the famous Allison Dubois.

16:19.560 --> 16:22.710
So tell me,what is my
fortune? What's in my future?

16:22.720 --> 16:28.640
Oh,I feel strongly you and your husband are going to
make a significant contribution to Mr. Devalos' campaign.

16:29.970 --> 16:31.680
Very clever,Mrs. Dubois.

16:31.690 --> 16:36.250
Allison, Constance's husband, Richard,owns a
very successful construction firm here in Phoenix,

16:36.260 --> 16:40.270
and they have been very
supportive over the years.

16:40.280 --> 16:41.880
But then,I'm sure you knew that.

16:41.900 --> 16:44.150
Oh,yes. I know everything.

16:44.160 --> 16:48.580
Well,tell me, do you happen to know when
my husband is actually going to show up?

16:53.450 --> 16:58.170
But the truth is, I did
not do it all myself.

16:58.180 --> 17:02.410
I was privileged to work with a
dedicated group of police detectives,

17:02.420 --> 17:06.020
and some of the most
talented ADAs in the country.

17:06.030 --> 17:10.920
And as most of you now
know, I had a secret weapon.

17:10.930 --> 17:14.670
Her name is Allison Dubois.

17:14.680 --> 17:20.130
Allison worked for me as an investigator,
as a jury consultant and as a paralegal.

17:20.140 --> 17:22.990
And it was her dedicated
service to the city of Phoenix

17:23.000 --> 17:28.610
that was invaluable in helping to convict
and incarcerate a number of violent criminals.

17:32.060 --> 17:33.070
So what does your crystal ball say?

17:33.080 --> 17:34.690
Is he going to win this election?

17:34.700 --> 17:36.030
I wish I knew.

17:36.040 --> 17:39.700
I'm afraid I'm as much in the
dark as anybody on this subject.

17:39.710 --> 17:41.890
Really? That doesn't seem fair.

17:41.900 --> 17:45.530
I think it's the universe's
way of evening the score.

17:45.540 --> 17:47.000
Connie!

17:47.370 --> 17:49.430
There you are.

17:50.430 --> 17:52.350
Sorry I'm late. What did I miss?

17:52.840 --> 17:55.570
The speeches,the food, the champagne...

17:55.590 --> 17:58.570
but let me introduce you to the
very best part of the evening.

17:58.600 --> 18:00.730
Richard,this is Allison Dubois.

18:00.740 --> 18:04.060
She's the psychic who was working
with Manuel all those years.

18:04.080 --> 18:07.170
A-ha,how do you do?

18:07.750 --> 18:11.050
Is this honestly the only way?

18:11.060 --> 18:13.610
It's the only way for you.

18:14.900 --> 18:17.850
You don't look happy,Richard.
You should be happy.

18:17.860 --> 18:20.330
I know I'm happy.

18:20.340 --> 18:22.580
Now,go.

18:22.610 --> 18:26.210
Go to your little party for
Manuel Devalos and enjoy yourself.

18:26.230 --> 18:30.060
And please write him a generous check.

18:30.070 --> 18:35.260
She looked into the future and said that you
are going to write a big check for this campaign.

18:35.310 --> 18:39.610
Well... we don't want to
make a liar out her,now do we?

18:47.460 --> 18:49.810
Hey,stranger.

18:49.820 --> 18:51.880
What time did you get in?

18:51.890 --> 18:53.810
A little before midnight.

18:53.820 --> 18:55.750
You two were dead to the world.

18:55.820 --> 18:59.420
Yeah,well,this little one
was exhausted from screaming.

18:59.710 --> 19:02.590
And me,I was exhausted from
trying to calm her down.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.900
Poor thing.

19:04.910 --> 19:07.080
Oh,I'm okay.

19:08.950 --> 19:11.640
So what did I miss?

19:12.240 --> 19:14.410
How was the fundraiser?

19:14.420 --> 19:17.110
Did we raise a lot of funds?

19:17.120 --> 19:19.000
Did we fund a lot of raises?

19:19.010 --> 19:20.060
It was fine.

19:20.070 --> 19:22.500
Well,actually, it was a little strange.

19:22.510 --> 19:25.780
I was introduced to this friend
of Devalos',this big donor.

19:25.790 --> 19:28.010
And the second I met him...

19:28.030 --> 19:30.470
I knew something was wrong.

19:30.480 --> 19:33.040
What do you mean "wrong"? Was he ill?

19:33.050 --> 19:34.650
Something going to happen to him?

19:34.660 --> 19:36.100
Not him,Devalos.

19:36.110 --> 19:39.100
Something bad was going
to happen to Devalos.

19:39.110 --> 19:40.910
What do you mean "bad"?

19:40.920 --> 19:42.470
I don't know.

19:42.480 --> 19:44.430
His friend was in cahoots with Van Dyke.

19:44.440 --> 19:47.560
They were plotting against Devalos.

19:47.570 --> 19:49.900
What do you mean?
Plotting against him how?

19:49.910 --> 19:52.060
I don't know.

19:53.480 --> 19:56.690
So you met this guy, and you
got a bad feeling about him.

19:56.700 --> 19:58.190
Then what happened?

19:58.200 --> 20:01.980
Well,then he wrote Devalos a big check.

20:01.990 --> 20:07.860
Well,I'm no politico, but there must be a better
way to crush a campaign than by funding it.

20:11.660 --> 20:13.250
So did you say something to him?

20:13.260 --> 20:14.690
Well,say wh||?

20:16.400 --> 20:19.570
The night seemed to be
going so well for him.

20:19.580 --> 20:22.170
I didn't want to be the one to ruin it.

20:24.240 --> 20:27.650
Especially since I don't know
what, if anything,is going on.

20:29.150 --> 20:33.760
All right,we have 45 minutes
before the girls get up.

20:33.770 --> 20:37.570
Oh,did you happen to see the note that
I left for you in the kitchen last night?

20:37.580 --> 20:40.460
The message from Scanlon?

20:41.730 --> 20:45.300
You know,I don't get it. I'm usually
persona non grata around here.

20:46.470 --> 20:49.150
You know,you're sneaking
around to meet me, but today,

20:49.160 --> 20:52.180
you're waiting for me by the front
door, escorting me up the elevator.

20:52.190 --> 20:52.820
What can I tell you?

20:52.830 --> 20:56.620
If I had my way,we'd pick you up in a limo,
offer you champagne and caviar for lunch.

20:56.630 --> 20:59.440
You know,don't you worry if you lie
like that, your nose is going to grow?

20:59.450 --> 21:01.320
Or God's going to
smite you or something?

21:01.330 --> 21:02.660
Look,the honest to God truth is,

21:02.670 --> 21:06.140
I got two dead 20-something guys who were
found exactly where you said they'd be,

21:06.150 --> 21:08.650
murdered exactly the
way you said they'd be.

21:08.660 --> 21:10.530
I need to get you with a sketch artist.

21:10.540 --> 21:12.070
I know it sounds like a lot of nothing.

21:12.080 --> 21:15.350
I just kind of felt funny
keeping it to myself.

21:15.360 --> 21:19.460
Well,I don't know what
to tell you,Allison.

21:19.470 --> 21:20.830
The man's check cleared.

21:20.840 --> 21:25.060
Well,at the end of the day, I guess
that's all that really matters.

21:29.750 --> 21:31.280
I'm being summoned.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.590
Oh,well,then don't let me keep you.

21:33.600 --> 21:35.930
You know,it meant a lot to me
that you were there last night,

21:35.940 --> 21:39.920
and for what it's worth, your name
was mentioned in this morning's paper.

21:39.930 --> 21:42.960
Well,then I guess it's
mission accomplished.

21:42.970 --> 21:44.070
Mission accomplished.

21:44.080 --> 21:45.910
I'll talk to you soon.

21:48.080 --> 21:52.780
You know,it just doesn't make much
sense what she's saying, Mr. Devalos.

21:52.790 --> 21:54.850
It just... doesn't.

21:54.860 --> 21:57.530
Well,I grant you,it doesn't
make much sense to us.

21:57.540 --> 22:00.730
No,it doesn't make much sense,period.

22:00.740 --> 22:04.580
Why would Richard Madsen be having secret
meetings with District Attorney Van Dyke?

22:04.590 --> 22:06.950
The man just donated a
truckload of money to you.

22:06.960 --> 22:07.970
Well,then, you tell me.

22:07.980 --> 22:09.870
What kind of deal could
they have been making?

22:09.880 --> 22:10.880
Manny,listen to yourself.

22:10.890 --> 22:13.860
You're becoming completely preoccupied
because some woman told you ...

22:13.870 --> 22:15.440
Not some woman.

22:15.450 --> 22:18.370
Allison Dubois. Do me a favor.

22:18.380 --> 22:22.300
Just... keep your ear to the ground.

22:22.690 --> 22:24.390
Okay.

22:42.960 --> 22:43.740
Got your message.

22:43.750 --> 22:46.170
Dispatch said you think you
may have spotted my suspect.

22:46.180 --> 22:49.310
My partner and I got a call to
break up a fight in the parking lot.

22:49.320 --> 22:53.460
We were finishing up in here with the owner,
and I saw someone that looked like your sketch.

22:53.470 --> 22:55.930
She even has the coat.

23:04.940 --> 23:06.750
Hello.

23:07.760 --> 23:09.460
Sorry.

23:10.290 --> 23:12.740
- Hello?
- Am I waking you?

23:12.750 --> 23:14.200
No. It's okay.

23:14.210 --> 23:17.430
I think I may have spotted your exterminating
angel, that woman you keep dreaming about?

23:17.440 --> 23:20.190
She's here at a bar trolling
for guys half her age.

23:20.200 --> 23:21.350
You're kidding.

23:21.360 --> 23:23.410
No,Allison. It's 11:45.

23:23.420 --> 23:26.830
I never kid after 10:00 on a weeknight.

23:27.580 --> 23:29.960
So here's what I'm calling to find out.

23:29.970 --> 23:30.950
You had any more dreams?

23:30.960 --> 23:35.400
I mean,is this chick gonna pull a chainsaw out
of her purse or a jackhammer out of her underwear?

23:36.840 --> 23:39.410
Is there anything I should
be on the lookout for?

23:39.420 --> 23:40.340
I'm sorry. I don't know.

23:40.350 --> 23:42.770
I haven't had a dreamt about
her in the last couple days.

23:42.780 --> 23:46.180
Okay,well,I'm gonna take that as a good sign,
maybe introduce myself to this little lady,

23:46.190 --> 23:48.250
see if I can get to the
bottom of this thing.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.470
Okay.

23:49.480 --> 23:51.400
- All right.
- Bye.

23:56.550 --> 24:01.440
I no,uh, speaka da English
so... so good,yeah,no.

24:01.450 --> 24:04.200
You speaka da English just fine.

24:04.210 --> 24:07.180
Oh,pretty. Oh,yeah.Yeah.

24:07.190 --> 24:12.580
Maybe,um, I-I teach
you Italiano later,huh?

24:16.220 --> 24:18.170
Excuse me? Excuse me!Phoenix PD.

24:18.180 --> 24:20.390
Ma'am,if I could ask you to please
step away from the gentleman.

24:20.400 --> 24:21.690
Keep your hands where I can see them.

24:21.710 --> 24:23.180
What's this all abou|| What's going on?

24:23.190 --> 24:24.600
It's about her,sir. It's not about you.

24:24.610 --> 24:26.290
If you could stand still and stay calm.

24:26.300 --> 24:30.310
I am not from here. Are you policia?

24:30.320 --> 24:31.370
Yeah. That's me.Policia.

24:31.380 --> 24:33.250
Tell you what. Why don't
you hand me the purse?

24:33.260 --> 24:34.610
Hand me the purse. Turn around.

24:34.620 --> 24:36.110
Put your hands on the car. Turn around.

24:36.120 --> 24:38.780
Put your hands on the car.

24:39.910 --> 24:41.810
Uh,scuzi? Scuzi?

24:43.610 --> 24:47.040
Says here,you're
Michelle Todd of Tucson.

24:47.310 --> 24:48.300
Okay.

24:48.310 --> 24:52.470
So,uh,is trying to impress a guy
in a bar against the law,Officer?

24:52.480 --> 24:54.170
Maybe.

24:54.180 --> 24:56.400
I think you're going to have
to come with me,Ms. Todd.

24:56.410 --> 24:58.250
What? I'm just a girl
looking to have some fun.

24:58.260 --> 25:00.790
- What's the crime?
- Murder.

25:01.090 --> 25:02.130
Well,wait a second.

25:02.140 --> 25:06.010
- What are you talking about?
- You ever had any contact with a Ryan Haas or Mr. Sean Covey?

25:06.020 --> 25:06.980
Who?

25:06.990 --> 25:08.260
Maybe you never asked them their names.

25:08.270 --> 25:10.240
A support group widower in
need of a little comfort?

25:10.250 --> 25:12.380
A bartender I suspect
you may have nailed?

25:12.390 --> 25:13.660
- You have the right to remain silent...
- Wait.

25:13.670 --> 25:14.840
Wait,wait. Wait a second.Wait a second!

25:14.850 --> 25:17.180
A bartender? Support group widowers?

25:17.190 --> 25:19.100
It sounds like you're talking
about my book. I have a...

25:19.110 --> 25:20.810
Ma'am,let's not make
this difficult,okay?

25:20.820 --> 25:22.710
No,no,look,look! Open my trunk.

25:22.720 --> 25:23.760
It sounds like my book!

25:23.770 --> 25:24.910
Open my trunk, and I'll show you!

25:24.920 --> 25:27.460
All right,all right,all right.

25:29.910 --> 25:31.990
If you take her for a second?

25:37.640 --> 25:43.920
A Cougar's Guide to the Hunt: Bagging a
Man in the Urban Jungle by Charisma Kennedy.

25:43.930 --> 25:45.760
Be nice. That's my pen name.

25:45.770 --> 25:48.700
Look,flip it over.
Look,see?That's my picture.

25:48.710 --> 25:49.500
It's beautiful.

25:49.510 --> 25:51.050
Thank you.

25:51.060 --> 25:54.010
See,in there...in there... Under
the chapter headings-- look,see?

25:54.020 --> 25:55.930
It's all there.

25:56.510 --> 25:59.520
"Making the Connection
at a Support Group."

26:00.120 --> 26:03.150
"Leaving More than a
Tip for the Bartender."

26:03.160 --> 26:05.400
Nothing in here about cops,huh?

26:05.410 --> 26:06.900
No. Why?

26:06.910 --> 26:08.240
Tonight's your lucky night.

26:08.250 --> 26:11.940
I'm going to take you downtown.

26:17.300 --> 26:19.840
I hate you. It's barely
7:00 in the morning.

26:19.850 --> 26:22.730
Hey,early bird,I thought you
wanted to catch this worm.

26:22.740 --> 26:25.500
Well,where is she? I've
been here since 6:00.

26:25.510 --> 26:28.450
Hold your horses. The
show is about to begin.

26:28.460 --> 26:31.420
Here comes your dream girl now.

26:37.710 --> 26:39.200
What do you think?

26:39.210 --> 26:40.440
Well,that's her.

26:40.460 --> 26:42.730
At least it looks like her.

26:43.670 --> 26:45.370
What's the hesitation about?

26:45.400 --> 26:47.300
I don't know. She looks so frightened.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.410
Well,being charged with
murder will do that to you.

26:50.420 --> 26:53.990
Hey,when you get a chance, if you have some
time, this is actually a pretty good read.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.350
Every seduction you ever
dreamed of is in here.

26:56.360 --> 26:58.690
The support group, the bartender.

26:58.700 --> 26:59.680
It's quite uncanny.

26:59.690 --> 27:02.680
What is this, a how-to
book for killing men?

27:02.690 --> 27:05.350
Not killing them,
Allison. Seducing them.

27:05.730 --> 27:08.980
Oh,you mean, there's no chapter in here
about the best way to nail-gun your man

27:08.990 --> 27:11.210
after he's flambéed you in the kitchen?

27:11.220 --> 27:13.900
Maybe she's saving that for the sequel.

27:14.830 --> 27:17.540
Let's go have a little chat.

27:17.940 --> 27:21.180
You both understand how absurd this is.

27:23.900 --> 27:25.960
I... Look at me!I-I...

27:25.970 --> 27:29.250
I don't even know how to
use a knife or a nail gun.

27:29.260 --> 27:31.710
I like men. In fact,I love them.

27:31.720 --> 27:34.120
I've made a lot of money loving them.

27:34.130 --> 27:35.290
How do you mean?

27:35.300 --> 27:38.350
Well, as Charisma
Kennedy, I have the books.

27:38.360 --> 27:40.400
I've written 12.

27:40.410 --> 27:42.540
That one came out four months ago.

27:42.560 --> 27:45.380
In fact,I'm still
doing the book signings.

27:45.400 --> 27:48.570
Then there's Charisma
Kennedy, the column and blog.

27:48.580 --> 27:52.630
Then as Michelle,I have The Single
Girl's Guide to Financial Independence.

27:52.640 --> 27:57.860
And then as John Todd,I have The Single
Guy's Guide to Financial Independence.

27:57.870 --> 28:01.760
I'm a busy little girl,
but I am no murderer.

28:01.770 --> 28:05.710
Then why don't you just tell us where
you were on the nights in question?

28:07.650 --> 28:09.080
Look,I don't mind
waiting for a couple hours

28:09.090 --> 28:12.320
until your lawyer gets into his
office and we can get him down here.

28:12.330 --> 28:13.350
No,really.

28:13.360 --> 28:14.970
I don't have anything to hide. I...

28:14.980 --> 28:18.530
It's just you're not
going to believe my alibi.

28:18.540 --> 28:19.080
What do you mean?

28:19.090 --> 28:22.420
Do you not remember what you were
doing on the nights in question?

28:22.430 --> 28:25.050
I remember exactly what I was doing.

28:25.080 --> 28:27.050
I was at home...

28:27.060 --> 28:28.870
alone... reading.

28:28.880 --> 28:31.820
I don't know.Based on
what I saw last night,

28:31.830 --> 28:35.330
you don't strike me as the
"home alone reading" type.

28:35.340 --> 28:37.800
Well,I am.

28:38.410 --> 28:40.390
For the most part.

28:40.410 --> 28:44.300
Sure,yeah,sometimes I have to go
out and see what's really going on.

28:44.310 --> 28:45.610
Hear the latest lines.

28:45.620 --> 28:48.310
Try a new technique.

28:48.320 --> 28:51.830
Is there a law against a single
girl looking to have some fun?

28:51.840 --> 28:54.150
You say that,but the fact
remains two men are dead.

28:54.160 --> 28:57.150
Well,I had nothing to do with it!

28:57.160 --> 28:58.910
I'm no killer.

28:58.930 --> 29:00.950
Like I said,I love men!

29:00.960 --> 29:04.970
But the fact remains two men have been murdered
using techniques eerily similar to not one,

29:05.000 --> 29:08.450
but two chapters in your book.

29:08.460 --> 29:12.550
Yeah,well,then, maybe it means
that your killer can read.

29:14.380 --> 29:17.020
Look,I'm going to make this
simple for you,Ms. Todd.

29:17.050 --> 29:19.520
If you can't provide us with an
alibi for the nights in question,

29:19.530 --> 29:22.760
then I'm gonna have to exercise
my right to hold you for 24 hours

29:22.780 --> 29:25.170
while I obtain a warrant
to search your apartment.

29:25.200 --> 29:26.470
But that's not right!

29:26.490 --> 29:29.600
Yeah,well... that's the law.

29:29.880 --> 29:30.530
But don't worry.

29:30.540 --> 29:35.650
I'll be sending a hot,young thing in
here in a minute to,uh,show you to a cell.

29:39.990 --> 29:41.820
Come in.

29:43.030 --> 29:44.310
Richard.

29:44.320 --> 29:46.700
Come on in. Take a seat.

29:49.380 --> 29:52.550
I'll just leave and
let you two catch up.

29:57.300 --> 30:00.140
So,you want to tell me about it?

30:00.150 --> 30:03.180
What... What are you
talking about,Manny?

30:04.030 --> 30:08.210
I got a message to come
see you, and here I am.

30:08.700 --> 30:12.860
It's your meeting. You want
an answer?Ask a question.

30:12.870 --> 30:16.130
Okay,here's a question.

30:16.140 --> 30:17.990
Did you know when I
was District Attorney,

30:18.000 --> 30:22.720
that some concerns surfaced about
corruption in the construction sector?

30:22.730 --> 30:24.900
No. I...I didn't know that.

30:24.910 --> 30:29.750
Didn't get very far before I was
asked to take a permanent vacation.

30:30.260 --> 30:33.310
But as it turns out, I still have some
friends in the District Attorney's office,

30:33.320 --> 30:37.430
and recently, they've brought
some information to my attention.

30:39.540 --> 30:42.860
Paying off city inspectors?

30:42.870 --> 30:44.390
Bribing council members?

30:44.410 --> 30:47.310
Van Dyke must have really
put the screws to you.

30:47.330 --> 30:49.210
I don't know what you're talking about,

30:49.230 --> 30:54.530
but this is a strange way to thank
a major contributor to your campaign.

30:55.230 --> 30:58.080
Yeah. Right.

30:58.480 --> 31:01.430
Thanks. So,how is that supposed to work?

31:01.440 --> 31:05.770
I cash the check, and then Van Dyke
announces that he's indicting you?

31:05.780 --> 31:09.220
And,oh,yes, isn't it funny that former
DA Manuel Devalos is taking money

31:09.230 --> 31:14.200
from a city contractor under
investigation for corruption and fraud?

31:14.210 --> 31:15.670
What did he promise you?

31:15.680 --> 31:19.900
A suspended sentence, some kind of fine?

31:21.610 --> 31:24.280
You're my friend,Manny.

31:24.290 --> 31:28.160
Y-You've always been my friend. I...

31:29.470 --> 31:32.380
I had no choice. I,uh...

31:34.130 --> 31:37.380
I can't go to jail.

31:42.530 --> 31:44.150
It was very strange.

31:44.160 --> 31:48.580
On one hand I had these very vivid
dreams, in which she was always the one.

31:48.590 --> 31:53.980
And then sitting across from her
today, my instincts told me I was wrong.

31:53.990 --> 31:56.660
Well,for God's sake,
listen to your instincts.

31:56.670 --> 31:58.030
Don't listen to your instincts.

32:01.370 --> 32:03.190
Well,she's in jail tonight.

32:03.200 --> 32:06.490
So,I guess it's up to the police
and the justice system now.

32:07.530 --> 32:09.210
Why are you scratching your ear?

32:10.160 --> 32:12.050
I don't know.

32:12.390 --> 32:15.720
I'm hoping it's just a case
of the power of suggestion.

32:15.730 --> 32:18.650
Hanging out with Marie all this
time, watching her scratch her ear.

32:19.940 --> 32:21.650
Well,I hope you're right.

32:21.660 --> 32:26.860
I will be very upset if I have to wake up early
in the morning and rush you to the pediatrician.

32:27.690 --> 32:30.240
Right back at you.

32:40.240 --> 32:41.550
Where you going?

32:41.560 --> 32:45.920
I told you. I have a transport at 0800.

32:46.610 --> 32:51.450
I'm shipping out to Germany for
a satellite operations assignment.

32:51.460 --> 32:54.190
So... last night was it?

32:54.200 --> 32:56.640
You turn me out and then you just leave?

32:56.650 --> 32:58.330
Honey,we agreed.

32:58.340 --> 32:59.740
No strings attached.

32:59.750 --> 33:01.130
No seeing each other again.

33:01.150 --> 33:03.790
Yeah,but that was before.

33:03.800 --> 33:06.880
I mean,this is kind of new to me,but...

33:06.890 --> 33:08.620
I don't want you to go.

33:08.630 --> 33:10.170
I'll tell you what.

33:10.180 --> 33:13.140
I'll give you something
special before I leave.

33:13.150 --> 33:15.980
Something to remember me by.

33:18.300 --> 33:19.870
Come here.

33:20.020 --> 33:21.830
What are you doing?

33:23.550 --> 33:26.610
You'll see. Give me your hand.

33:33.900 --> 33:35.620
There you go.

33:35.950 --> 33:37.760
Now the other.

33:39.610 --> 33:41.800
There you go.

33:46.520 --> 33:49.270
Now close your eyes.

33:53.050 --> 33:55.440
Lift your head.

34:08.500 --> 34:10.520
They're bringing her up right now.

34:10.530 --> 34:12.060
How is she?

34:12.070 --> 34:13.409
Relieved. Upset.

34:13.420 --> 34:15.239
Thrilled that she's starting
to look like she's not guilty.

34:15.250 --> 34:17.719
Horrified that somebody's doing this.

34:17.730 --> 34:18.900
I don't know what to tell you,Lee.

34:18.909 --> 34:20.860
In my dreams,I saw her.

34:20.870 --> 34:22.239
I saw her kill that man last night.

34:22.250 --> 34:23.860
I saw her kill all those men.

34:23.870 --> 34:26.110
Well,she definitely didn't kill
the guy you called about last night.

34:26.120 --> 34:29.380
She's been under lock and
key for the past 24 hours.

34:29.389 --> 34:34.719
Ms. Todd, I want to tell you that the Phoenix
Police Department extends its sincerest apologies.

34:35.130 --> 34:36.659
So,that's it?

34:36.670 --> 34:37.639
************

34:37.650 --> 34:41.639
********

34:41.650 --> 34:45.000
*********you are free to go.

34:49.690 --> 34:54.090
You know, my book has sold
upwards of 60,000 copies.

34:54.100 --> 34:55.320
Okay.

34:55.330 --> 34:59.690
Well,it seems to me that means there are at
least 60,000 people who could be doing this.

34:59.920 --> 35:02.960
Who could be using my book, my...

35:02.970 --> 35:06.810
techniques, the scenarios I've
written to lure young men into bed.

35:06.820 --> 35:08.540
Yeah,actually,I thought
about that myself.

35:08.550 --> 35:12.270
Except I couldn't find the setup for
last night's killing anywhere in here.

35:12.280 --> 35:14.400
- Really?
- Really.Here.

35:14.410 --> 35:17.090
We know that the killer was
dressed up as a naval officer.

35:17.100 --> 35:20.230
And there isn't any, anything
like that in the book.

35:20.240 --> 35:22.920
A naval officer?

35:22.930 --> 35:26.420
Oh,they told me they hated that one.

35:26.440 --> 35:28.150
I'm sorry. Who told you they hated what?

35:28.160 --> 35:29.560
My publisher.

35:29.590 --> 35:32.140
It was one of the scenarios
that was cut from my book.

35:32.150 --> 35:34.200
Uh,"Patriot Games" I think I called it.

35:34.210 --> 35:36.770
Female naval officer.It's her
last night before shipping off

35:36.780 --> 35:42.070
and she is going to spend it
sharing her bedroom secrets *******

35:42.630 --> 35:45.010
Um,are there any others?

35:45.020 --> 35:45.840
Sure.

35:45.850 --> 35:48.980
I remember they couldn't wait to get
rid of "Naughty Nun with a Bad Habit."

35:48.990 --> 35:52.780
It was like,who has a
nun's habit hanging around?

35:52.790 --> 35:54.880
Oh,and then there's "The Extra Ticket."

35:54.900 --> 35:56.000
Simple,but effective.

35:56.010 --> 36:01.870
Very few men can resist the,the temptation of
accepting that extra ticket to "tonight's big game."

36:02.190 --> 36:06.380
Of course,it's after the game
that the fun really begins.

36:06.390 --> 36:12.240
And these techniques, these chapters that
were cut, who else might have seen them?

36:12.250 --> 36:17.510
Sandra Marshall, my publisher,
and-and-and her staff. Yeah.

36:24.230 --> 36:26.040
*******

36:26.050 --> 36:28.440
Can I have the remote,please?

36:29.670 --> 36:31.100
Thank you.

36:31.110 --> 36:35.340
I'm here to speak with you today on behalf
of my client and friend,Richard Madsen.

36:35.350 --> 36:36.950
Many of you know Richard.

36:36.960 --> 36:38.720
- He built our new hospital downtown.
- What the hell is this?

36:38.730 --> 36:42.110
He's currently hard at work
on our new arts complex.

36:42.120 --> 36:45.480
His firm is also involved in the
upkeep of our bridges and roadways.

36:45.490 --> 36:50.430
Also,Mr. Madsen is a major financial
supporter of my run for District Attorney,

36:50.440 --> 36:54.530
which is why it saddened me earlier today
to learn that for the past several months,

36:54.540 --> 36:58.980
Mr. Madsen's firm has been involved in
a series of payoffs to city officials

36:59.010 --> 37:03.740
in order to secure contracts and approvals
his company might not otherwise have enjoyed.

37:03.750 --> 37:05.150
Oh,my God.

37:05.160 --> 37:06.530
My conscience...

37:06.540 --> 37:08.060
it's been weighing on me.

37:08.070 --> 37:12.060
So, I decided to talk
to my friend Manuel here,

37:12.070 --> 37:15.410
who has advised me to throw
myself on the mercy of the court.

37:15.420 --> 37:17.420
No! No,no,no,no,no!

37:17.430 --> 37:20.750
Corruption in city government
is an insidious problem.

37:20.770 --> 37:25.800
It cannot happen if it
is not allowed to happen.

37:28.990 --> 37:31.350
Ladies,my name is Detective Lee Scanlon.

37:31.360 --> 37:36.850
I'm sure you're all familiar with the recent series
of killings here in Phoenix targeting young,single men.

37:37.080 --> 37:42.350
Well,we have reason to believe that these killings may
have been inspired by a book that you published here,

37:42.360 --> 37:43.850
a book that all of you women worked on.

37:43.860 --> 37:48.240
It's called A Cougar's Guide to the
Hunt: Bagging a Man in the Urban Jungle.

37:48.250 --> 37:51.410
I'm sure you're all
familiar with it. Yeah?

37:51.870 --> 37:54.070
Well,as part of our investigation,uh,

37:54.080 --> 37:59.760
I'm going to need to know where each of you were on
the nights that each of these killings took place.

37:59.770 --> 38:02.520
Then put it right five
times,Bridge, but...

38:04.840 --> 38:05.910
Hello?

38:05.920 --> 38:06.590
Allison. It's Lee.

38:06.600 --> 38:08.480
I'm over here at Michelle's
publishing company.

38:08.490 --> 38:10.100
I gotta tell you, it's
a complete strikeout.

38:10.110 --> 38:15.050
Every single one of the women who worked
on this book has a rock-solid alibi.

38:15.470 --> 38:16.880
Allison?

38:16.890 --> 38:19.240
I don't know what to tell
you,Lee. I'm stumped,too.

38:19.250 --> 38:22.190
Well,that's two of us.
Except I'm stumped and hungry.

38:22.200 --> 38:24.480
Uh,I'm going to get out of
here.Call me if you need me.

38:24.490 --> 38:25.950
Okay.

38:48.150 --> 38:49.740
You work here?

38:49.750 --> 38:51.230
No. Just visiting.

38:51.240 --> 38:53.720
Are you an author?

38:54.090 --> 38:57.080
Elliot Davis. This is my company.

38:57.950 --> 38:59.930
Nice to meet you.

38:59.940 --> 39:00.950
Are you from out of town?

39:00.960 --> 39:04.930
You got that slightly dazed, "I'm
from out of town" look in your eye.

39:04.940 --> 39:06.760
Do I?

39:08.040 --> 39:09.020
You know what?If you're free,

39:09.030 --> 39:11.830
I've got a couple of tickets
to the big game tonight.

39:11.840 --> 39:16.280
I was supposed to go with a buddy
of mine, but he just cancelled.

39:16.290 --> 39:20.080
We could grab some dinner.
Catch the game.Whatever.

39:20.730 --> 39:23.860
Where should I pick you up?

39:25.830 --> 39:28.370
What? You've never been
approached by a man before?

39:28.380 --> 39:30.590
At my age,I don't get
approached much by anybody.

39:30.600 --> 39:33.440
No,I don't believe that.

39:33.890 --> 39:36.230
I mean,who doesn't appreciate
the company of young people?

39:36.240 --> 39:40.880
But every now and then, it's nice to spend some
time with somebody who can carry on a conversation.

39:42.590 --> 39:47.430
Ah,you'd be amazed at the number of
people, who otherwise would never...

39:48.070 --> 39:49.850
yeah,they're at a vulnerable moment.

39:49.860 --> 39:52.040
They're lonely. They're bored.

39:52.050 --> 39:53.760
In a strange city.

39:56.910 --> 40:00.300
It's just a basketball game.

40:01.160 --> 40:04.860
I've been told I'm terrific company.

40:05.640 --> 40:08.440
I promise you, I'm discreet.

40:08.450 --> 40:14.880
In fact,I think I can safely say that no one who's
ever spent time with me has ever lived to regret it.

40:18.380 --> 40:22.620
City detectives announced this
afternoon that publisher Elliot Davis

40:22.630 --> 40:25.970
has been arrested and charged
with three counts of murder.

40:25.980 --> 40:31.350
The 49-year-old Davis reportedly confessed
to luring three local men to their deaths,

40:31.370 --> 40:37.480
using a book his company published that
advises older women how to seduce young men.

40:37.490 --> 40:40.300
Michelle Todd,who goes by
the name Charisma Kennedy,

40:40.310 --> 40:42.940
the author of A Cougar's
Guide to the Hunt,

40:42.950 --> 40:47.090
was shocked to learn how her book
played a role in the murder spree...

40:47.100 --> 40:48.190
Okay,quit moving.

40:48.200 --> 40:50.620
I can't get this medicine in your ear.

40:50.630 --> 40:53.740
Naturally,I'm shocked and
saddened that a book that

40:53.760 --> 40:56.090
I wrote with the intention
of bringing pleasure

40:56.100 --> 41:00.640
and-and hope to women of a certain age
would be used in such a perverse way.

41:00.660 --> 41:04.130
I mean,it's obviously
a very effective book...

41:04.150 --> 41:06.680
maybe too effective.

41:08.960 --> 41:10.390
And what's next for you?

41:10.400 --> 41:14.360
Well,ironically,this tragedy has brought
a lot of attention to the Cougar books.

41:14.370 --> 41:18.490
I've gotten a number of calls from cable
networks about a Cougar reality show,

41:18.500 --> 41:23.590
and maybe a Cougar Web site or a social
networking,uh,page like My Cougar.

41:23.600 --> 41:27.040
And you know... I'm open to anything.

41:27.420 --> 41:28.950
What is she saying? I can't hear.

41:28.960 --> 41:32.510
I can't hear anything with all
this, this medicine in my ear.

41:32.520 --> 41:35.300
Don't worry. You didn't miss a thing.
