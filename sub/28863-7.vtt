We'll be quick. One change,
one small change,

will be different.

will they grow back?

What is doing that?

Evolution.

this one thing

for anything again.

like your portrait?

10:02.602 --> 10:03.904
I made it myself.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.739
You're an artist, too, yes?

10:05.773 --> 10:08.909
The ease of your lines
betrays an intense discipline.

Beautiful Gabrielle?

GABRIELLE:
The way their brain works.
They have no logic.

13:42.890 --> 13:45.558
If they see something,
it exists,

13:45.592 --> 13:48.428
and then when it's gone...

13:54.767 --> 13:58.138
You know, it's not crazy babies
that worry me.

13:58.171 --> 14:01.008
It's the men they become.

14:02.042 --> 14:04.577
Like a fire,

14:04.611 --> 14:08.415

put them out,

14:15.588 --> 14:19.426
It bothers you,
because you think you matter.

14:19.459 --> 14:21.094
That people matter.

14:25.966 --> 14:28.401
What's the point
of living if not?

14:32.605 --> 14:35.242

14:36.776 --> 14:42.182
All people, with names,
with families...

14:42.215 --> 14:44.217
now just a pile.

But you're here.

You have a child.

A tragedy.

15:50.517 --> 15:52.819
How did they come to be here?

15:54.021 --> 15:57.157
They were orphaned, adrift.

15:57.190 --> 15:59.959
And when I became
the king of the underworld,

15:59.993 --> 16:02.595
I... I opened my palace to them.

I mean, how could I not?

Where...?

16:29.656 --> 16:31.824
It's remarkable, isn't it?

16:31.858 --> 16:34.661
A vast other-dimensional realm

16:34.694 --> 16:38.331
unbound by anything
but one's imagination.

16:38.365 --> 16:41.534

Don't tell me
you have never been.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.805
No.

Powers like yours
and you don't even realize it.

16:50.943 --> 16:52.912
Feel it.

16:52.945 --> 16:56.549
This place.

16:56.583 --> 17:00.987
It exists between time
and space.

17:01.020 --> 17:04.691

ranting and raving.

I flourished.

And then you reached out.

18:26.973 --> 18:29.976
You saw me.

18:30.009 --> 18:33.280
And in return I saw you.

(growls)

21:43.069 --> 21:46.473
Please. Please,
you have to help me.

21:46.506 --> 21:48.641
I was a king.

21:48.675 --> 21:50.042
A king, you hear.

21:50.076 --> 21:52.779
I was a king!

21:52.812 --> 21:54.814
(monkey chittering)

22:03.990 --> 22:06.359
DAVID:
Don't be afraid.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.061
I'm here to help.

22:09.696 --> 22:10.930
I'm here to help.

22:11.998 --> 22:14.000
Dreaming?

22:14.033 --> 22:16.002
I had that same feeling...

22:16.035 --> 22:19.706
for 30 years.

22:19.739 --> 22:21.741
You know who I am?

22:23.209 --> 22:25.211
Yes, you do.

22:26.212 --> 22:29.115
Open your mind.

22:33.052 --> 22:34.887
(baby David cooing)

22:34.921 --> 22:36.423
(burbles)

22:36.456 --> 22:39.158
-No. It's...
-Don't...

22:39.191 --> 22:41.193
say it out loud.

22:41.227 --> 22:42.795
(monkey chitters)

22:44.864 --> 22:46.733
We're very exposed.

22:46.766 --> 22:48.200
What do you...?

22:48.234 --> 22:49.469
(monkey screeches)

22:57.209 --> 22:58.945
DAVID:
We're safe here.

22:58.978 --> 23:01.047
This is your mind.

23:01.080 --> 23:04.250
We... w-we're inside
your m-mind.

23:04.283 --> 23:05.785
(chuckles)

23:05.818 --> 23:08.588
We need someplace
private to talk.

23:08.621 --> 23:10.757
He hears everything-- Farouk.

23:10.790 --> 23:13.426
-Y-You know him?
-(bitter laugh)

23:15.127 --> 23:17.129
(sighs)

23:19.231 --> 23:20.633
Eat this.

23:20.667 --> 23:22.802
What, what is it?

23:22.835 --> 23:24.837
Knowledge.

23:39.452 --> 23:41.488
Mmm.

23:41.521 --> 23:44.457
(clamoring, yelling)

23:44.491 --> 23:46.493
(crashing)

23:49.829 --> 23:51.764
(gasps)

23:53.833 --> 23:57.169
(screaming)

23:57.203 --> 23:58.805
(gasps)

24:01.841 --> 24:03.843
My son.

24:09.315 --> 24:11.484
He wanted you to come.

24:12.852 --> 24:15.955
You thought you were
looking for him, but...

24:15.988 --> 24:18.290
he was looking for you.

24:18.324 --> 24:20.326
(pounding on door)

24:20.359 --> 24:22.361
-CHARLES: What's that?
-(pounding continues)

24:24.631 --> 24:26.633
Not now.

24:26.666 --> 24:29.468
Listen to me.
Tomorrow he attacks,

24:29.502 --> 24:31.638
and you fight Farouk
in the astral plane-- your power

24:31.671 --> 24:33.205
against his--
and you think you win.

24:33.239 --> 24:35.474
But all that happens is,
you kick him out of his body

24:35.508 --> 24:37.476
-and into mine.
-S-So we leave.

24:37.510 --> 24:38.878
Now, we go home.
Your mother, she's waiting...

24:38.911 --> 24:40.547
No, he won't let you.

24:40.580 --> 24:42.281
It's a trap.

24:42.314 --> 24:43.983
You're in a trap.

24:46.853 --> 24:49.021
But this time
you have the advantage.

24:50.056 --> 24:51.524
I do?

24:53.059 --> 24:55.695
You have me.

24:55.728 --> 24:57.730
(birds tweeting outside)

25:03.536 --> 25:05.872
I've got you, old man.

25:05.905 --> 25:08.675
You rest.

25:08.708 --> 25:10.242
You're telling me

25:10.276 --> 25:11.811
that David is a baby?

25:11.844 --> 25:13.379
In this time, yes.

25:15.181 --> 25:17.884
-And that woman...
-Gabrielle.

25:17.917 --> 25:20.086
-...is his mother?
-Mm-hmm.

25:20.119 --> 25:23.890
And we are not going
to kill this...

25:23.923 --> 25:25.692
whatever, baby David.

25:25.725 --> 25:27.359
Which would be so easy.

25:27.393 --> 25:29.428
Physically, not morally.

25:29.461 --> 25:31.497
Because why?

25:31.530 --> 25:34.000
Because he's a baby.

25:34.033 --> 25:36.202
It's not his fault.

25:36.235 --> 25:38.738
But it will be his fault...

25:38.771 --> 25:40.740
when he's a grown-up.

25:40.773 --> 25:42.208
(sighs)

25:42.241 --> 25:44.076
Maybe, probably.

25:44.110 --> 25:46.913
But we're changing time.

25:46.946 --> 25:48.681
Right? By being here.

25:48.715 --> 25:50.116
So maybe not.

25:50.149 --> 25:52.685
-(exhales)
-Remember how I told you

25:52.719 --> 25:54.921
about Oliver and Melanie,
how they raised me?

25:54.954 --> 25:57.757
I remember
you saying that, yeah.

25:58.791 --> 26:00.593
And I know it sounds crazy,

26:00.627 --> 26:02.561
even to me,

26:02.595 --> 26:05.131
but they taught me,
there are some people

26:05.164 --> 26:07.967
that you can save
and some that you can't.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.370
David, adult David,
we can't save him.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.139
He's too far gone.

26:13.172 --> 26:15.207
But a baby?

26:15.241 --> 26:17.476
This baby?

26:17.509 --> 26:20.880
Him, we can save.

26:20.913 --> 26:22.949
Even though he's gonna be
the exact same person.

26:22.982 --> 26:24.150
Even though he's gonna be

26:24.183 --> 26:25.718
the exact same person.

26:25.752 --> 26:27.754
But he's not yet.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.924
Look, this wasn't my choice.

26:31.958 --> 26:33.960
Any of it.

26:36.295 --> 26:38.130
But we're here.

26:40.967 --> 26:42.902
We could just...

26:42.935 --> 26:44.937
walk away.

26:47.974 --> 26:49.942
It's about change.

26:49.976 --> 26:51.610
(scoffs)

26:51.644 --> 26:54.046
And all of the terrible things
that he did...

26:56.548 --> 26:58.550
...to me.

27:02.221 --> 27:04.223
So I'm gonna stay.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.627
You don't have to.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.568
Yes, I do.

27:27.413 --> 27:29.415
(sinister cackling)

27:32.084 --> 27:34.086
*

27:52.671 --> 27:55.041
(Middle Eastern music playing
faintly)

28:02.048 --> 28:03.883
-CHARLES: Good morning.
-Charles.

28:03.916 --> 28:05.918
How was your sleep?

28:05.952 --> 28:08.087
Did you hear
the thunder last night?

28:08.120 --> 28:09.521
Magnificent.

28:09.555 --> 28:11.557
(chuckles)

28:11.590 --> 28:15.461
*

28:26.538 --> 28:29.108
(chuckles)
Who is this?

28:29.141 --> 28:31.410
This is David.

28:31.443 --> 28:33.279
An old friend.

28:33.312 --> 28:35.714
He was stationed here in Morocco
during the war and...

28:35.748 --> 28:37.383
well, he decided
to stick around.

28:37.416 --> 28:38.851
And when he heard
I was visiting...

28:38.885 --> 28:40.719
What can I say?
I love a free meal.

28:40.753 --> 28:42.121
Hmm.

28:42.154 --> 28:44.156
(sniffs)

28:49.661 --> 28:52.464
Heck of a place you got here.

28:53.800 --> 28:56.102
Yes. That it is. (chuckles)

28:56.135 --> 28:59.205
Sit, sit. Please.

28:59.238 --> 29:01.640
Any friend of Charles

29:01.673 --> 29:03.609
is a friend of mine.

29:15.121 --> 29:18.190
* Bang! Bang! *

29:24.330 --> 29:26.665
Mmm, it really is
quite delicious.

29:26.698 --> 29:30.236
(chuckling):
Yes. Yes.

29:30.269 --> 29:32.238
Moroccan food.

29:32.271 --> 29:36.075
So, David,
where were you stationed?

29:36.108 --> 29:39.511
Mohammedia. Just outside Rabat.

29:39.545 --> 29:41.147
Came in with Operation Torch,

29:41.180 --> 29:42.614
like the rest
of the meddling Americans.

29:42.648 --> 29:44.650
Hmm? (chuckles)

29:44.683 --> 29:46.919
But the locals like me.

29:46.953 --> 29:49.856
Guess it's my winning smile.

29:50.857 --> 29:53.125
(chuckles)

29:53.159 --> 29:55.027
* Why I'm telling you
this sorry tale *

29:55.061 --> 29:56.863
-* It went bang,
I said shut up *
-* Bang! *

29:56.896 --> 29:59.866
-* Bang! *
-* I said rap up *

29:59.899 --> 30:02.368
* Well, I'm aware that the guy
must do his work *

30:02.401 --> 30:04.937
* But the pile driver man
drove me berserk *

30:04.971 --> 30:06.939
* He said "Captain,"
I said "Wot" *

30:06.973 --> 30:08.774
* He said Captain, I said. *

30:08.807 --> 30:10.442
DAVID:
You should never have come.

30:10.476 --> 30:12.011
(coughs)

30:12.044 --> 30:13.512
(liquid pours)

30:16.315 --> 30:17.884
FAROUK:
I apologize.

30:17.917 --> 30:19.518
If you'll excuse me,

30:19.551 --> 30:22.221
I have to make myself decent.

30:22.254 --> 30:24.123
Please,

30:24.156 --> 30:25.858
please enjoy.

30:27.860 --> 30:29.862
(Switch panting)

30:33.032 --> 30:35.902
(sinister chuckling)

30:38.537 --> 30:40.006
DAVID:
We have him rattled.

30:40.039 --> 30:41.173
I knew it.

30:41.207 --> 30:43.209
...rattled. I knew it.

30:43.242 --> 30:45.177
I'm the unexpected element.

30:45.211 --> 30:46.745
-I'm...
-SWITCH: David.

30:46.778 --> 30:48.780
(breathing heavily)

31:09.101 --> 31:10.903
How did we get here?

31:10.937 --> 31:13.205
Oh, not now. I'm too close.

31:13.239 --> 31:15.041
But we were just
in the dining room.

31:15.074 --> 31:16.542
It's time.

31:16.575 --> 31:18.277
The enemy...

31:18.310 --> 31:20.412
Switch...

31:20.446 --> 31:22.414
wake up.

31:22.448 --> 31:24.250
I need you.

31:25.317 --> 31:27.353
David, who is this girl?

31:27.386 --> 31:29.655
(whispering):
Not here.

31:30.822 --> 31:32.891
-Who is she?
-She's...

31:32.925 --> 31:34.426
(exhales)

31:34.460 --> 31:37.063
No one. She's a means
of getting here.

31:37.096 --> 31:38.464
Of reaching you.

31:38.497 --> 31:40.299
Everyone is someone, David.

31:40.332 --> 31:42.301
-(sighs)
-(pounding on door)

31:42.334 --> 31:44.636
What, what is happening?
What are you not telling me?

31:44.670 --> 31:46.973
Nothing, just--
we need to focus.

31:47.006 --> 31:48.840
Killing Farouk. A plan.

31:50.409 --> 31:51.910
David, why are you here?

31:51.944 --> 31:54.580
I showed you.

31:54.613 --> 31:57.583
-He ruins me.
-Well, maybe we can talk to him.

31:57.616 --> 31:59.986
-Explain.
-(pounding resumes)

32:00.019 --> 32:01.487
Stop it.

32:01.520 --> 32:02.821
-(pounding, rattling)
-Stop it.

32:02.854 --> 32:04.456
I said...

32:04.490 --> 32:06.358
(distorted):
Stop.

32:09.528 --> 32:11.230
David?

32:11.263 --> 32:13.265
(loud thud)

32:14.700 --> 32:16.702
(steady, slow thudding)

32:28.014 --> 32:30.983
Daddy, is that you?

32:43.695 --> 32:45.797
David?

32:45.831 --> 32:48.800
DIVAD:
Nope, sorry.

32:48.834 --> 32:51.270
David isn't here right now.

32:51.303 --> 32:53.472
He had to go someplace quiet.

32:53.505 --> 32:55.041
We're in charge now.

32:55.074 --> 32:58.277
-You know what we have to do.
-No.

32:58.310 --> 33:00.979
-Revenge.
-DVD: No, justice.

33:01.013 --> 33:03.882
Right, justice.
We're here for justice.

33:03.915 --> 33:06.018
Because you couldn't protect us.

33:06.052 --> 33:08.520
-Me?
-Daddy. The leaver.

33:08.554 --> 33:10.956
The great abandoner.

33:10.989 --> 33:14.526
Who put a monster in our head
and then threw us away.

33:14.560 --> 33:16.162
Adoption.

33:16.195 --> 33:18.797
DVD:
Betrayal.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.732
No.

33:20.766 --> 33:22.168
-David.
-DIVAD: Daddy.

33:22.201 --> 33:24.170
-CHARLES: David, wake up.
-Daddy.

33:24.203 --> 33:26.238
Wake up!

33:26.272 --> 33:27.839
Daddy?

33:27.873 --> 33:29.908
(whispering):
Daddy. Daddy.

33:29.941 --> 33:32.378
-Daddy.
-Daddy.

33:32.411 --> 33:34.513
-Daddy.
-(whispering): Daddy.

33:34.546 --> 33:37.416
-Daddy. Daddy.
-Daddy.

33:37.449 --> 33:39.485
-Daddy.
-Daddy.

33:39.518 --> 33:41.187
-Daddy.
-Daddy.
-Daddy.

33:41.220 --> 33:42.321
-Daddy.
-Daddy.

33:42.354 --> 33:45.357
(Davids saying "Daddy")

33:48.026 --> 33:49.528
Daddy!

33:59.371 --> 34:02.374
(crying)

34:08.080 --> 34:10.516
Charles, come home.

34:10.549 --> 34:12.050
Come home.

34:20.392 --> 34:22.394
*

34:30.502 --> 34:34.440
So, is he a good baby? David?

34:34.473 --> 34:36.908
He, uh...

34:39.111 --> 34:42.614
He cries a lot,
like he knows something.

34:44.116 --> 34:46.118
What could he know?

34:47.153 --> 34:49.288
Me.

34:53.259 --> 34:55.794
People talk about having
a second childhood.

34:55.827 --> 34:58.764
What they mean...

34:58.797 --> 35:00.098
is they feel young again.

35:00.132 --> 35:03.602
But I've had
two actual childhoods.

35:03.635 --> 35:05.437
Meaning I was a baby twice.

35:06.472 --> 35:08.907
I grew up twice.

35:08.940 --> 35:11.076
The first time I ran,

35:11.109 --> 35:12.811
and then I walked.

35:12.844 --> 35:18.517
This time I crawled, I walked...
I felt safe.

35:18.550 --> 35:21.687
That's all he wants...
to feel safe.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.689
That's all he wants...

35:23.722 --> 35:25.724
to feel safe.

35:27.793 --> 35:29.628
(chops wood)

35:29.661 --> 35:32.198
My grandmother had the sickness.

35:32.231 --> 35:36.134
She was, uh...

35:36.168 --> 35:38.170
(speaks Romany)

35:38.204 --> 35:41.507
Spells, moods,
she spoke in tongues.

35:43.542 --> 35:45.311
I remember her eyes.

35:45.344 --> 35:50.148
Miserable and giddy,
like... a happy death.

35:50.182 --> 35:52.184
(screaming)

35:52.218 --> 35:55.053
My mother was 16
when the sickness hit her.

35:56.488 --> 35:58.857
In the witching hour,
she woke up laughing.

35:58.890 --> 36:01.560
Didn't stop for 14 days.

36:01.593 --> 36:03.329
You're talking
about mental illness.

36:03.362 --> 36:05.364
Such a clinical name
for something so raw.

36:05.397 --> 36:09.868
Like an animal with its heart
on the outside.

36:09.901 --> 36:12.671
It's so odd.
I never thought of that.

36:12.704 --> 36:15.307
It's hereditary,
what's wrong with him.

36:15.341 --> 36:17.108
Why he's like this.

36:18.677 --> 36:20.078
Who?

36:22.414 --> 36:25.251
Listen to me.

36:25.284 --> 36:28.520
This baby, this little baby.

36:28.554 --> 36:32.958
You have to love him.
Okay?

36:35.193 --> 36:38.564
Like his life depends on it.

36:38.597 --> 36:42.200
Like the world will end
if you don't.

36:42.234 --> 36:46.137
Hold him and love him.

36:47.439 --> 36:51.343
Don't let the monsters in.

36:51.377 --> 36:54.980
Because when he's grown,
it will be too late.

36:57.949 --> 36:59.651
Hey, look at me.

37:01.920 --> 37:04.390
We all have our role to play
in this war we're fighting,

37:04.423 --> 37:06.592
good against evil.

37:06.625 --> 37:10.429
There is no good stronger
than mother's love.

37:12.431 --> 37:14.733
Do you understand?

37:17.269 --> 37:18.337
I think so.

37:25.944 --> 37:28.079
Are you really here?

37:31.283 --> 37:33.285
(sighing)

37:43.829 --> 37:46.798
(sinister cackling)

37:46.832 --> 37:50.336
No. No.

37:50.369 --> 37:52.538
No, no.

38:00.211 --> 38:01.480
Is it normal?

38:01.513 --> 38:02.681
What?

38:02.714 --> 38:04.115
Time. I heard something.

38:04.149 --> 38:06.151
(sinister cackling)

38:07.986 --> 38:09.755
David.

38:09.788 --> 38:11.557
(sighs)

38:14.960 --> 38:16.962
(sinister cackling)

38:18.964 --> 38:20.532
-Cary, wake up.
-(groaning)

38:20.566 --> 38:21.800
Wake up!

38:21.833 --> 38:23.535
I don't feel good.

38:23.569 --> 38:25.671
That's because you have a
concussion and a punctured lung.

38:25.704 --> 38:28.273
(pants)
Did we find David?

38:28.306 --> 38:29.541
(sighs)
Kind of.

38:29.575 --> 38:30.876
Wh-What does that mean?

38:30.909 --> 38:32.210
We have to go.

38:32.243 --> 38:33.979
Kerry.

38:35.013 --> 38:36.382
Fine. We found David,

38:36.415 --> 38:38.450
but he's a baby
and we have to protect him,

38:38.484 --> 38:39.685
because...

38:39.718 --> 38:41.152
I don't know.

38:41.186 --> 38:42.688
Baby?

38:42.721 --> 38:44.055
(Kerry sighs)

38:44.089 --> 38:45.491
Kerry...

38:45.524 --> 38:47.726
Kerry! Kerry!

38:47.759 --> 38:49.561
(sinister cackling)

38:49.595 --> 38:51.597

38:58.537 --> 39:00.872

39:41.246 --> 39:44.249
(baby David crying)

39:46.652 --> 39:49.020
It's okay. It's okay.

39:49.054 --> 39:51.022
We need to get out
of this house.

39:51.056 --> 39:52.591
(crying continues)

39:52.624 --> 39:54.392

Eat this.

40:17.415 --> 40:18.950
CHARLES:
What, what is it?

40:18.984 --> 40:21.252
Knowledge.

40:29.360 --> 40:31.663
DAVID 1:
David, wake up.

40:31.697 --> 40:32.998
We need to finish Farouk.

40:33.031 --> 40:34.132
DAVID 2:
Daddy left us again.

40:34.165 --> 40:35.400
He doesn't want our help.

-DAVID 2:
We can't stay here any longer.

41:20.679 --> 41:23.314
DAVID 1:
Okay, it's time.

41:29.320 --> 41:32.724
Can you make them
stop screaming?

41:32.758 --> 41:36.061
Wait, w-wait, y-you can talk?

41:36.094 --> 41:38.196
They're all inside of me.

41:38.229 --> 41:40.198
I can't sleep.

41:40.231 --> 41:42.233
Who?

41:43.569 --> 41:46.337
Every tyrant has his supporters.

-(screeching)
-KING: Please,
you have to help me.

42:22.574 --> 42:24.142
David.

42:26.077 --> 42:28.046
You're right, it's my fault.

42:28.079 --> 42:29.581
(takes deep breath)

42:29.615 --> 42:32.017
I've been naive.

42:32.050 --> 42:34.886
You were just a baby to me.

42:36.054 --> 42:38.189
I'm supposed to have time to...

42:38.223 --> 42:41.459
to know this, how to...

42:41.492 --> 42:43.695
how to be a father.

42:43.729 --> 42:46.064
(thunder rumbling)

42:46.097 --> 42:48.066
But now...

42:48.099 --> 42:49.801
See, I came here for friendship.

42:49.835 --> 42:52.370
Because I've been to war, David.

42:52.403 --> 42:55.173
I've seen what people do.

42:56.241 --> 42:58.576
But this Farouk, he...

43:00.578 --> 43:03.148
...he's a monster.

43:04.616 --> 43:07.786
The only way to stop him
is to kill him.

43:07.819 --> 43:10.588
(inhales deeply)

43:10.622 --> 43:12.624
(exhales)

43:14.159 --> 43:16.094
How?

43:16.127 --> 43:19.330
He's too powerful for just you.

43:19.364 --> 43:22.600
That's why he
slipped away before.

43:22.634 --> 43:25.436
But now there's two of us.

43:25.470 --> 43:27.005
Together...

43:28.039 --> 43:29.841
...we'll crush him.

43:49.394 --> 43:52.130
What a journey I have had.
