- SMURF: Watch your back in there, baby.

00:01.238 --> 00:04.373
Manny's crew have always
been a bunch of real scumbags.

00:09.595 --> 00:10.666
My beer.

00:15.601 --> 00:17.935
Uh, signed KTM hat.

00:17.937 --> 00:20.620
Your brother said that
his fell apart, so...

00:21.873 --> 00:24.173
- You wanna get drunk with me?
- Yeah.

00:29.681 --> 00:33.191
I dust a little H onto
a joint to calm down.

00:46.821 --> 00:49.960
I had sex with someone last night.

02:00.669 --> 02:01.718
Hey.

02:02.040 --> 02:03.136
Hey.

02:04.140 --> 02:05.435
How long have you been awake?

02:05.982 --> 02:07.962
Um, I don't know. A while.

02:09.485 --> 02:10.733
Can we talk, please?

02:13.919 --> 02:14.963
I messed up.

02:15.665 --> 02:16.754
I'm sorry.

02:20.096 --> 02:22.446
I know it's been hard for you ever since

02:23.342 --> 02:24.529
Smurf's been in jail.

02:24.554 --> 02:27.088
And, you know, you've
had to keep things going,

02:27.090 --> 02:30.230
and I know I haven't been helping much.

02:30.302 --> 02:31.754
But, uh...

02:33.195 --> 02:34.293
it's been ha...

02:34.318 --> 02:35.786
It's been hard for me, too.

02:41.527 --> 02:42.691
You know, I, uh...

02:43.663 --> 02:45.523
I, uh, called my dad

02:45.548 --> 02:47.088
and said I wanted to come to Guam.

02:47.272 --> 02:48.356
You know what he said?

02:48.918 --> 02:52.353
He said I could come back for Christmas

02:52.481 --> 02:53.556
for a week.

02:53.764 --> 02:54.771
Maybe.

02:57.682 --> 02:58.926
Your dad's an asshole.

03:03.783 --> 03:05.441
Look, I-I do want you here.

03:09.515 --> 03:10.701
Go back to sleep.

03:12.700 --> 03:14.039
I'm gonna go for a run.

03:28.113 --> 03:29.135
Hey.

03:29.608 --> 03:30.680
Hey.

03:32.237 --> 03:33.252
Um...

03:33.918 --> 03:36.519
is it... is it okay if we sleep inside?

03:36.659 --> 03:38.521
It's just... It's really cold out at night,

03:38.523 --> 03:40.820
and there's lots of empty rooms.

03:41.060 --> 03:42.361
We could pay you.

03:44.051 --> 03:45.327
I'll have to ask Smurf.

03:46.064 --> 03:47.304
Wait! Wait.

03:52.998 --> 03:54.298
I can get you more.

03:59.562 --> 04:00.649
I'll let you know.

04:09.386 --> 04:11.010
You're just moving it around.

04:11.655 --> 04:13.055
I'm not hungry.

04:13.057 --> 04:14.813
You said you'd eat it if I cooked it.

04:15.659 --> 04:17.192
It's okay. It's okay.

04:19.274 --> 04:20.779
I'll heat it up for you later.

04:26.281 --> 04:28.323
What are we gonna do today?

04:29.434 --> 04:32.249
Your teacher sent
homework packets. Do those.

04:34.424 --> 04:35.627
It's math.

04:35.982 --> 04:37.006
Okay.

04:37.692 --> 04:39.292
It's fractions.

04:41.061 --> 04:42.151
Hmm.

04:43.160 --> 04:44.387
Fractions.

04:47.115 --> 04:48.629
Do you know how to do fractions?

04:49.529 --> 04:50.595
Nope.

04:50.724 --> 04:51.790
Hmm.

04:55.357 --> 04:57.127
What are you gonna do?

04:57.462 --> 04:58.922
What am I gonna do?

05:01.048 --> 05:02.509
I have to find you a doctor.

05:02.918 --> 05:04.117
Why? I'm not sick.

05:04.119 --> 05:05.318
Not that kind of doctor.

05:05.320 --> 05:07.083
It's the kind of doctor that you talk to.

05:07.388 --> 05:08.854
There are some doctors you go to

05:08.856 --> 05:10.353
when you're feeling mad or sad.

05:10.500 --> 05:11.833
They talk to you.

05:11.858 --> 05:12.823
Why?

05:14.729 --> 05:15.995
Because it's supposed to help you

05:15.997 --> 05:17.918
not feel mad or sad anymore.

05:18.333 --> 05:21.111
Have you ever been to
that kind of doctor before?

05:21.247 --> 05:22.581
Yeah. I have.

05:22.818 --> 05:23.857
Did it help?

05:25.680 --> 05:26.776
Um...

05:27.815 --> 05:29.610
No. Not really.

05:29.635 --> 05:32.524
But your school is not
gonna let you go back there

05:32.526 --> 05:34.990
unless you... You talk to a doctor.

05:35.599 --> 05:38.709
So... that's what you're gonna do.

05:47.591 --> 05:49.541
That kid looks like she ate another kid.

05:49.686 --> 05:51.742
We playing cards or talking shit?

05:51.816 --> 05:53.125
Got somewhere to be?

05:57.032 --> 05:58.766
You got any pictures of your boys, Smurf?

05:59.000 --> 06:00.276
Heard they're fine.

06:03.321 --> 06:04.386
No.

06:04.411 --> 06:05.410
Oh, come on.

06:05.492 --> 06:06.891
Not even hanging over your bed?

06:08.567 --> 06:10.279
Not even over my bed.

06:10.720 --> 06:12.102
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

06:12.394 --> 06:14.126
'Cause I wouldn't want this shithole

06:14.128 --> 06:15.785
to start feeling like home.

06:16.398 --> 06:18.760
You just broke 60 days. No bail.

06:19.267 --> 06:20.884
That usually ain't good.

06:22.204 --> 06:24.820
I prefer to think on the positive side.

06:26.688 --> 06:27.888
You're looking tired.

06:27.913 --> 06:30.413
You staying up all night thinking positive?

06:31.346 --> 06:32.942
Might want to get comfortable.

06:32.942 --> 06:34.044
Garcia...

06:35.752 --> 06:37.410
...you talk too much.

07:14.119 --> 07:15.169
Mornin'.

07:15.534 --> 07:16.559
Hey.

07:16.559 --> 07:18.491
Sorry. I was just cleaning the pool.

07:18.805 --> 07:19.893
Yeah.

07:20.383 --> 07:21.694
Getting a little funky.

07:22.010 --> 07:23.019
Yeah.

07:25.553 --> 07:27.516
Why do you use a cotton ball?

07:28.617 --> 07:29.704
Filters it.

07:29.904 --> 07:31.285
So you don't shoot any rocks.

07:32.221 --> 07:35.464
I've seen people use
cigarette butts, tampons.

07:39.495 --> 07:40.810
Nasty shit.

07:45.230 --> 07:47.104
Isn't it easier to just smoke it?

07:50.952 --> 07:51.975
Mm.

07:54.166 --> 07:55.185
Kid...

07:56.379 --> 07:58.059
anything that feels this good...

08:00.649 --> 08:01.980
you gotta earn.

08:03.652 --> 08:07.631
Like the world just got
a fresh coat of paint.

08:08.991 --> 08:10.826
Don't get any ideas, okay?

08:12.753 --> 08:15.129
Last thing I need is
little J coming after me

08:15.131 --> 08:18.399
'cause you decided to run
off and join the circus.

08:20.417 --> 08:21.869
I don't like needles.

08:23.633 --> 08:24.871
Nobody does.

08:26.371 --> 08:27.474
Ooh.

08:40.152 --> 08:41.339
What are you doing here?

08:42.109 --> 08:43.303
Enjoying the morning.

08:45.246 --> 08:46.761
You got home late last night.

08:47.108 --> 08:48.539
Yeah, I had an errand to run.

08:48.844 --> 08:49.897
Right.

08:50.062 --> 08:51.143
Errand boy.

08:57.386 --> 08:59.721
Smurf whistles, and
you got to come running.

09:04.860 --> 09:07.119
You know, I don't think
we should hook up anymore.

09:08.197 --> 09:09.286
"Hook up"?

09:11.036 --> 09:12.317
Is that what you call it?

09:17.466 --> 09:18.531
How's Nicky?

09:18.740 --> 09:20.189
She was pretty messed up yesterday.

09:20.741 --> 09:21.830
She's fine.

09:22.478 --> 09:24.102
Leave Nicky out of this, all right?

09:26.948 --> 09:29.310
Saw her doing smack with
that burnout at your house.

09:30.819 --> 09:32.567
That shit creeps up on you, you know?

09:33.555 --> 09:35.263
Think it's cool to keep
her around all that?

09:37.136 --> 09:39.412
If you got something to
say, you should just say it.

09:42.898 --> 09:44.641
She doesn't belong there.

09:45.500 --> 09:47.315
The only reason she's here is you.

09:52.662 --> 09:55.254
So, you want her around, and that's cool.

09:55.911 --> 09:57.912
So whatever happens to her is on you.

10:18.800 --> 10:20.317
Seriously with the hat, man?

10:21.737 --> 10:23.552
I texted him and said, "We're surfing."

10:24.206 --> 10:25.272
He said he was down.

10:25.274 --> 10:26.874
There are rules to this shit, man.

10:26.876 --> 10:29.142
You don't just bring a
three-pack. It's two guys max.

10:29.144 --> 10:30.477
We used to flip on people

10:30.479 --> 10:32.545
for that "bring your own crowd" bullshit.

10:32.547 --> 10:33.947
It's Clark Lincoln, man.

10:33.949 --> 10:35.749
He said he was meeting us
there, so it doesn't count.

10:35.751 --> 10:37.484
I don't care. Of course it counts.

10:37.486 --> 10:38.886
You know, there are also rules

10:38.888 --> 10:40.720
about being a whiny little
bitch, too, you know.

10:44.173 --> 10:45.423
It's just the hat.

10:46.206 --> 10:48.061
What are you talking about? It looks good.

10:58.574 --> 10:59.907
Sick hat, buddy.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.907
See? "Sick hat."

11:02.711 --> 11:03.888
What's up, dude?

11:05.046 --> 11:06.213
How's it lookin'?

11:06.336 --> 11:07.839
Super consistent.

11:08.249 --> 11:10.307
Tide's going low for a couple more hours.

11:11.520 --> 11:12.864
Sweet. Mm-hmm.

11:13.402 --> 11:14.988
Thought you were just a motocross guy.

11:14.990 --> 11:16.281
How long you been surfing?

11:17.126 --> 11:19.264
Five, six years now, maybe.

11:20.462 --> 11:21.929
Plus, you know, I needed a hobby

11:21.931 --> 11:23.663
that <i> didn't</i> put me in the hospital

11:23.665 --> 11:24.945
every time I ate shit.

11:25.101 --> 11:26.100
True.

11:26.205 --> 11:28.039
Plus, you know, it keeps me healthy.

11:29.215 --> 11:30.215
Yeah.

11:33.660 --> 11:34.836
I'm gonna go change.

11:38.007 --> 11:39.725
You gotta be kidding me.

11:42.275 --> 11:44.231
What, they couldn't get
the other five in the van?

11:44.997 --> 11:46.088
Jesus.

11:47.142 --> 11:48.584
<i>Now</i> you're worried about the rules?

12:48.252 --> 12:50.870
What the hell, man? Is that the
only way you kooks can catch waves?

12:50.872 --> 12:52.435
You bring five guys with you?

12:53.140 --> 12:54.540
You got a problem, friend?

12:54.542 --> 12:56.791
I'm not your friend.
Get the hell outta here.

12:56.816 --> 12:57.838
Or what?

12:59.671 --> 13:01.691
This isn't gonna end up the
way you think it is, bro,

13:01.753 --> 13:02.752
all right?

13:02.777 --> 13:03.779
You sure?

13:46.427 --> 13:47.393
So?

13:49.082 --> 13:50.279
Good news first...

13:50.483 --> 13:53.423
The evidentiary hearing has been set

13:53.423 --> 13:54.684
for Friday at 8:00 A.M.,

13:54.709 --> 13:57.510
and based on everything
they turned over to us

13:57.512 --> 13:59.952
in discovery, we're in good shape.

14:00.449 --> 14:03.674
The only physical evidence
linking you to Mr. Cano

14:03.851 --> 14:05.519
is the ballistics report,

14:05.720 --> 14:07.921
and the coroner's report confirms

14:07.923 --> 14:10.671
that the bullet fired from your weapon

14:10.992 --> 14:12.186
was postmortem.

14:12.594 --> 14:16.165
Grisly, yes, but not murder.

14:17.999 --> 14:19.287
What's the bad news?

14:19.734 --> 14:21.134
Um...

14:21.136 --> 14:23.696
There was, um, a piece of evidence

14:24.005 --> 14:26.005
submitted <i> after</i> discovery.

14:26.007 --> 14:28.007
Now, the ADA's office is trying

14:28.009 --> 14:30.810
to hold the specifics until the hearing,

14:30.812 --> 14:33.278
but I told them that
that was unacceptable...

14:33.280 --> 14:34.626
Cut the bullshit.

14:40.087 --> 14:41.473
They have a witness.

14:45.366 --> 14:46.348
Who?

14:56.220 --> 14:58.322
I'm going to get a cup of coffee.

15:04.318 --> 15:06.576
Go easy on him, Janine.

15:06.601 --> 15:09.154
He's trying to preserve his
ability to argue this case!

15:09.179 --> 15:10.923
What the hell is that supposed to mean?!

15:11.279 --> 15:13.456
I need you to tell me right now

15:13.569 --> 15:15.994
if there is anyone the ADA
could have found to testify

15:15.996 --> 15:19.778
that you paid for or
arranged Javier Cano's murder.

15:21.437 --> 15:23.081
It's a yes-or-no
question.

15:38.054 --> 15:39.969
Hey, I'm sorry about
all that shit out there.

15:40.857 --> 15:41.865
It happens.

15:42.918 --> 15:44.919
I gotta get going. My
shift starts in an hour.

15:48.395 --> 15:50.044
Okay. I'll see you soon.

15:53.469 --> 15:55.380
Honor, bro, seriously.

15:55.831 --> 15:56.871
Peace, man.

15:58.367 --> 15:59.300
Later.

15:59.302 --> 16:00.902
Yo, uh... don't trip out

16:00.904 --> 16:02.663
and call me crazy, but, um...

16:05.477 --> 16:06.877
...I think Linc might be gay.

16:10.079 --> 16:11.408
Wait,<i> is</i> he gay?

16:13.048 --> 16:14.468
You, uh...

16:14.850 --> 16:16.317
Geez, if I knew you wanted to bang him,

16:16.319 --> 16:17.783
I probably wouldn't have made a move.

16:18.053 --> 16:19.587
You're banging Clark Lincoln?

16:19.589 --> 16:20.926
Shh! Bro!

16:26.305 --> 16:27.360
Hey, Clem?

16:28.347 --> 16:29.586
Who are these assholes?

16:30.995 --> 16:32.425
They showed up a few weeks ago,

16:32.425 --> 16:34.621
starting trouble in the water, at the bars.

16:35.035 --> 16:37.003
They put a bouncer from
Brew House in the hospital.

16:37.237 --> 16:38.637
One of them slapped Charlie Walker's kid

16:38.639 --> 16:39.813
at the pier the other day.

16:39.813 --> 16:41.747
Wait, Charlie's kid from the juice bar?

16:42.950 --> 16:44.149
He's like 13.

16:44.404 --> 16:46.204
Whatever. Charlie's kid's a pussy.

16:46.206 --> 16:47.272
He's homeschooled.

16:47.274 --> 16:48.571
Yeah, at least he's from here.

16:48.955 --> 16:51.464
These guys just roll into town
and think they own the place.

16:51.464 --> 16:52.744
Pretty much.

16:52.898 --> 16:54.831
Eh, well, I guess someone's
gonna have to step up

16:54.856 --> 16:56.004
and mind the store.

16:57.263 --> 16:58.511
I thought that was <i> your</i> job.

16:59.593 --> 17:01.327
This town's gone soft, man.

17:07.673 --> 17:08.954
Check this out.

17:53.254 --> 17:54.775
_

17:55.998 --> 17:57.126
Shit.

17:59.174 --> 18:00.198
Hey.

18:00.662 --> 18:01.871
What's up, D?

18:02.687 --> 18:04.221
Too early for a beer?

18:06.244 --> 18:07.357
Oh.

18:07.445 --> 18:10.790
Look at you, Mr. Businessman.

18:11.183 --> 18:12.309
Not now, Billy.

18:12.389 --> 18:13.463
Okay.

18:14.045 --> 18:15.111
I get it.

18:16.655 --> 18:19.755
Hey, uh, where'd you get
all these boards, man?

18:20.124 --> 18:22.179
Customers. Friends. People.

18:22.460 --> 18:24.113
They're cool. I dig 'em.

18:24.929 --> 18:28.434
I had this magic seven-six
back in the day, man...

18:29.296 --> 18:30.895
Lost it in the rip at Sunset.

18:30.920 --> 18:32.050
God damn.

18:32.671 --> 18:34.522
I wish I still had that baby.

18:34.606 --> 18:36.572
Yeah, why? So you could
hang it up on my wall?

18:37.942 --> 18:41.112
Hey, dude, I get it. You're busy. No prob.

18:41.137 --> 18:44.671
No, you know what, you just
don't have to keep coming in here

18:44.673 --> 18:46.540
and playing the whole dad card.

18:46.542 --> 18:47.941
It's fine. We're good, all right?

18:47.943 --> 18:49.367
Dude, I'm not playing the dad card.

18:49.367 --> 18:53.213
I just thought, you know,
you might be... interested

18:53.215 --> 18:56.769
in this little side project
thing I got going on.

18:58.113 --> 18:59.446
No, I'm not interested.

18:59.448 --> 19:01.315
Oh, I think you're gonna be interested.

19:01.459 --> 19:05.319
Four-man job, payoff is
60 to 80 grand, ballpark...

19:05.321 --> 19:06.654
Maybe more... All cash.

19:06.656 --> 19:08.990
God, shut up. You're so full of shit.

19:10.259 --> 19:11.471
All right. Whatever.

19:11.659 --> 19:12.814
Humor me.

19:12.996 --> 19:15.262
You like the idea, you
can do whatever you want.

19:15.264 --> 19:16.397
You can bring your brothers in

19:16.399 --> 19:17.825
or you can leave your brothers out.

19:17.857 --> 19:19.309
That's up to you... Your call.

19:21.954 --> 19:23.468
What's your cut?

19:23.727 --> 19:24.988
Equal split.

19:28.530 --> 19:29.715
What's the job?

19:30.288 --> 19:31.697
Let's go for a ride.

19:33.616 --> 19:34.639
Come on.

19:45.754 --> 19:47.183
Where have you been?

19:47.659 --> 19:49.430
I had business with a tenant.

19:49.590 --> 19:51.329
Were you able to handle things?

19:52.143 --> 19:53.511
Yeah. Deran helped.

19:54.838 --> 19:55.842
J.

19:58.036 --> 20:00.041
Do you remember the party I took you to

20:00.043 --> 20:03.598
out in the desert with all my old friends?

20:06.120 --> 20:08.970
Do you think you would
remember how to get back there?

20:09.519 --> 20:10.899
Yeah, I think so.

20:14.804 --> 20:16.749
I need you to find some people.

20:17.793 --> 20:20.083
That's the first place I would look.

20:20.795 --> 20:21.889
Who?

20:26.981 --> 20:27.994
Shit.

20:30.031 --> 20:31.497
I need you to find them.

20:31.834 --> 20:33.366
Tell me what they're up to.

20:33.368 --> 20:36.502
Are they working? Anybody locked up?

20:36.504 --> 20:37.503
Whatever.

20:37.505 --> 20:38.829
What if they're not there?

20:38.854 --> 20:40.621
Then you keep looking.

20:43.264 --> 20:44.912
What are you asking me to do?

20:44.913 --> 20:46.923
What I tell you to do.

20:53.742 --> 20:54.741
I'll try.

20:54.743 --> 20:55.924
You'll try?!

21:01.290 --> 21:03.881
When your mother ended up the way she did,

21:05.107 --> 21:06.427
who'd you call, J?

21:07.450 --> 21:08.797
Hmm? Who'd you call?

21:12.071 --> 21:13.270
I called you, Smurf.

21:13.272 --> 21:14.620
That's right.

21:15.360 --> 21:16.915
You called <i> me.</i>

21:17.784 --> 21:20.118
And I took you out of
that shithole apartment.

21:20.158 --> 21:23.480
I gave you a beautiful
home. I gave you a family.

21:23.505 --> 21:25.535
I g... I gave you a life.

21:28.181 --> 21:29.446
Now you find them.

21:29.448 --> 21:30.878
I'm not asking.

21:30.984 --> 21:32.280
Are we clear?

21:34.598 --> 21:36.756
Are... we... clear?

21:39.189 --> 21:40.255
Yes.

21:57.844 --> 21:59.534
How many do you think they have in there?

22:00.779 --> 22:02.659
100,000 plants... easy.

22:05.051 --> 22:07.784
I got pulled out of 7th-grade
English class in handcuffs

22:07.786 --> 22:08.986
for selling dime bags.

22:08.988 --> 22:11.039
Now this shit's legal. Insane.

22:11.039 --> 22:12.104
I know.

22:12.105 --> 22:14.030
It's the Goddamn golden goose, kid.

22:14.324 --> 22:16.261
State lets you grow it and sell it,

22:16.364 --> 22:18.693
Feds tell the banks they
can't hold the money.

22:20.171 --> 22:22.197
Yeah, Baz always wanted
to hit a dispensary.

22:22.199 --> 22:23.459
I always thought it was too risky.

22:25.318 --> 22:27.652
Dude,<i> everybody</i>
hits dispensaries, okay?

22:27.854 --> 22:31.430
These guys, they sell to
50 dispensaries at once.

22:31.718 --> 22:33.864
All right? All cash transactions.

22:35.201 --> 22:36.360
How do they move it?

22:36.953 --> 22:38.027
Vans.

22:39.149 --> 22:40.148
Vans?

22:40.173 --> 22:41.111
Mm-hmm.

22:42.189 --> 22:43.264
Armored?

22:44.391 --> 22:45.487
I don't know.

22:46.862 --> 22:48.225
Well, they're guarded, right?

22:48.572 --> 22:49.604
Yeah.

22:51.064 --> 22:54.344
So vans, probably armored,

22:54.765 --> 22:56.041
with security.

22:57.250 --> 22:58.382
How would <i> you</i> do it?

22:59.637 --> 23:01.428
You hit the vans, obviously.

23:02.908 --> 23:04.840
- Okay, you hit the vans.
- Mm-hmm.

23:04.842 --> 23:06.510
And how do you hit the van?

23:06.512 --> 23:08.414
Do you run it off the road?

23:08.439 --> 23:10.571
Do you point a gun in someone's face?

23:10.727 --> 23:11.765
How?

23:12.784 --> 23:13.961
All of the above.

23:15.474 --> 23:16.487
What?

23:16.917 --> 23:19.051
What happens when they
start shooting at you?

23:19.053 --> 23:20.787
- You shoot back.
- Shoot back?

23:20.789 --> 23:22.422
Shoot first if you have to.

23:23.055 --> 23:24.062
Jesus.

23:24.062 --> 23:25.101
What?

23:25.126 --> 23:27.991
What, you think I haven't
done big jobs before?

23:28.016 --> 23:29.799
What the hell do you know?

23:29.801 --> 23:31.396
About you? Nothing.

23:55.362 --> 23:56.514
Feel better?

23:58.261 --> 23:59.329
Yeah.

24:01.904 --> 24:03.133
Like you care.

24:07.010 --> 24:08.557
How do you know about the take?

24:10.157 --> 24:11.796
I worked here for a couple weeks,

24:11.796 --> 24:14.935
and I got booted for sampling product.

24:16.240 --> 24:17.302
Mm.

24:17.302 --> 24:19.025
You said this guy's a pretty big deal.

24:19.240 --> 24:20.805
Does he have any other operations?

24:21.105 --> 24:23.796
Eh, maybe two, three.

24:26.844 --> 24:28.301
It's a good idea, man.

24:31.250 --> 24:33.010
It's a good idea.

24:40.695 --> 24:42.190
- Yo.
- Hey.

24:43.193 --> 24:44.269
What happened?

24:44.831 --> 24:47.195
Oh. Uh, my board hit me.

24:47.447 --> 24:48.695
Your board hit you?

24:52.793 --> 24:55.324
Five guys come out, start
burning me at the pier.

24:55.716 --> 24:56.993
I say something.

24:58.013 --> 24:59.612
I got punched like six times,

24:59.614 --> 25:01.481
held underwater until I passed out.

25:01.504 --> 25:04.058
Well, did you say you were
from here? That you knew us?

25:04.083 --> 25:06.560
Dude, I passed out.

25:07.639 --> 25:09.239
All right.

25:09.241 --> 25:11.236
Are you gonna kick their asses or what?

25:12.047 --> 25:14.444
You need to go back to regular school, man.

25:14.651 --> 25:17.305
Quit this job and work in construction

25:17.330 --> 25:19.596
or a gas station or something!

25:24.123 --> 25:26.123
- Is the chocolate good?
- Yeah.

25:26.125 --> 25:27.415
You don't seem happy.

25:27.440 --> 25:28.744
Mornin', Pope.

25:34.800 --> 25:35.933
Mr. Cody?

25:36.340 --> 25:37.522
I'm Melanie Southards

25:37.522 --> 25:39.497
with the Department of
Child and Family Services.

25:39.723 --> 25:41.054
Nice to meet you.

25:45.916 --> 25:47.480
And you must be Lena.

25:47.864 --> 25:49.380
It's very nice to meet you.

25:49.799 --> 25:52.124
Chocolate. It's my favorite, too.

25:52.952 --> 25:54.818
Lena, I need to talk with your uncle.

25:54.820 --> 25:56.576
Would it be okay if you
waited for us inside?

25:58.143 --> 25:59.877
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

26:13.180 --> 26:15.305
Mr. Cody, I'm following up on some concerns

26:15.307 --> 26:17.999
Lena's school had regarding
her situation at home.

26:18.474 --> 26:19.649
Her situation?

26:21.004 --> 26:22.944
My understanding is that she's
been suspended from school

26:22.946 --> 26:24.412
for behavioral issues

26:24.414 --> 26:27.478
that may be connected to
some recent personal trauma.

26:28.550 --> 26:30.961
I understand Lena's father
passed away recently.

26:32.323 --> 26:33.477
Yeah, he did.

26:33.589 --> 26:34.765
I'm so sorry.

26:35.125 --> 26:36.390
And he was...?

26:36.392 --> 26:37.721
He was my brother.

26:38.594 --> 26:39.727
Blood relative?

26:39.729 --> 26:41.729
No, but, uh...

26:41.945 --> 26:44.079
And Lena's mother, Catherine?

26:44.081 --> 26:46.081
She's no longer present in the home.

26:46.373 --> 26:47.631
Is that correct, as well?

26:48.352 --> 26:50.164
No. She's not.

26:51.088 --> 26:52.805
This is Lena's primary residence?

26:53.423 --> 26:55.757
No drugs, firearms in the home?

26:55.759 --> 26:56.810
No.

26:57.491 --> 26:59.625
May I go inside and talk with Lena alone?

26:59.650 --> 27:00.828
Of course.

27:10.974 --> 27:12.386
You live here now?

27:13.188 --> 27:14.238
Yeah.

27:14.730 --> 27:16.030
Lena likes it here.

27:16.827 --> 27:19.057
It's not the address we have on file.

27:31.542 --> 27:32.607
Hey.

27:34.141 --> 27:36.007
Hey, did you, uh, did you talk to Smurf?

27:36.009 --> 27:37.675
Um, yeah, but...

27:37.677 --> 27:39.795
I don't know how much it is.
I didn't have time to count it.

27:39.879 --> 27:41.528
Oh, and I have this.

27:41.528 --> 27:43.098
It's a real diamond.

27:44.322 --> 27:46.780
So, uh, which room can we have?

27:49.404 --> 27:51.627
I'll clear some space in Deran's old room.

27:53.471 --> 27:54.638
Sweet.

27:59.132 --> 28:00.682
Oh, hey, I cleaned the pool.

28:05.833 --> 28:06.959
What's wrong?

28:09.824 --> 28:11.216
Hey, talk to me.

28:18.197 --> 28:19.596
Do you remember when we used to go

28:19.621 --> 28:21.486
down to the beach by San Elijo?

28:24.127 --> 28:25.550
Used to make fires,

28:26.105 --> 28:27.320
drink beers,

28:29.108 --> 28:30.575
until the rangers chased us out?

28:30.577 --> 28:31.720
You remember?

28:39.120 --> 28:40.439
Dina was right.

28:43.390 --> 28:46.359
She said I should never have
called Smurf when my mom died.

28:47.928 --> 28:50.070
Hey, what were you supposed to do?

28:50.331 --> 28:51.530
You were alone.

28:51.532 --> 28:53.532
You had nowhere else
to go. She took you in.

28:53.534 --> 28:55.267
She takes <i> everybody</i> in.

28:57.008 --> 28:59.672
And then she expects you to
spend the rest of your life

28:59.674 --> 29:00.923
paying her back.

29:04.272 --> 29:05.694
Hey, what's going on?

29:07.014 --> 29:08.413
I went to see Smurf today.

29:08.415 --> 29:10.816
She wants me to go to the
desert to find Javi's guys.

29:10.818 --> 29:12.417
No, no, no, no, no. Y-You can't.

29:12.419 --> 29:14.871
- Y-You c... You can't go near them.
- I have no choice.

29:15.622 --> 29:17.023
I have to do it.

29:20.695 --> 29:21.926
We could leave.

29:24.213 --> 29:25.768
It's not that simple.

29:26.587 --> 29:27.719
Why not?

29:27.761 --> 29:29.828
We could go right now to the bank,

29:29.853 --> 29:31.912
take what's left of Smurf's accounts.

29:32.773 --> 29:34.311
You could go to college,

29:34.509 --> 29:35.728
I could work.

29:36.716 --> 29:38.124
We could do it.

29:40.981 --> 29:42.104
I can't.

29:43.851 --> 29:45.539
You think <i>they</i> would care?

29:46.587 --> 29:49.420
They don't want you here any
more than they want <i> me.</i>

29:56.463 --> 29:57.363
Hey.

29:59.466 --> 30:00.619
We can.

30:01.736 --> 30:02.898
Okay?

30:33.956 --> 30:35.568
Long time no see, my friend.

30:35.759 --> 30:37.078
You're Brazilian, right?

30:37.705 --> 30:38.771
Uh-huh.

30:38.773 --> 30:40.305
Who's this crew driving this van around

30:40.307 --> 30:42.050
with the Brazilian flag on it?

30:42.340 --> 30:43.607
I'm hearing shit.

30:46.668 --> 30:48.847
They come by to have boards fixed.

30:49.061 --> 30:50.770
But I don't like these guys, okay?

30:50.918 --> 30:53.318
Rich kids, no respect.

30:53.320 --> 30:55.393
Hmm. So that's it?

30:56.056 --> 30:57.207
Rich kids?

31:01.062 --> 31:02.218
Listen, Craig.

31:02.997 --> 31:04.312
These guys...

31:06.401 --> 31:08.240
...they are <i> soldados,</i> right?

31:08.403 --> 31:09.798
<i>Traficantes.</i>

31:10.237 --> 31:12.738
They have a steady coke
connection from Brazil.

31:13.010 --> 31:16.035
They show up where they think
nobody's looking, take over.

31:16.568 --> 31:18.361
So they think that nobody's looking?

31:19.110 --> 31:20.132
Is that it?

31:21.242 --> 31:24.189
Why am I just finding out
about this now, Mauricio?

31:25.064 --> 31:28.481
People hear about Baz dying, Smurf in jail.

31:29.407 --> 31:31.711
Think maybe the Codys have enough problems.

31:44.453 --> 31:45.738
Damn, Smurf.

31:46.134 --> 31:47.546
You look like shit.

31:47.668 --> 31:49.468
What do you want, Garcia?

31:49.470 --> 31:52.117
Tina bounced. Didn't know if you heard.

31:53.698 --> 31:55.141
Transferred her to the sheriff's station

31:55.143 --> 31:56.358
for her court date.

31:56.477 --> 31:57.874
Witness never showed.

31:58.373 --> 32:00.539
Is that the luckiest
bitch you ever met or what?

32:01.416 --> 32:02.581
What are you gonna do?

32:02.751 --> 32:04.978
People come in, people get out.

32:05.643 --> 32:07.427
Got to stay positive, right?

32:08.797 --> 32:10.481
Shit.

32:11.626 --> 32:14.427
You should've seen your
face. You were scared as hell.

32:16.350 --> 32:17.415
Relax.

32:18.026 --> 32:19.953
Tina told me to make sure you're safe.

32:20.399 --> 32:21.931
As long as your boy keeps paying.

32:21.931 --> 32:22.930
He will.

32:22.933 --> 32:23.931
Good.

32:24.796 --> 32:26.764
Unless you don't want <i>
me</i> looking after you.

32:27.465 --> 32:30.099
You know, since I talk so much.

32:31.333 --> 32:32.593
Just walk straight.

32:33.083 --> 32:34.323
Make it easy.

32:35.006 --> 32:36.259
Tina kinda liked you.

32:36.674 --> 32:37.701
I don't.

33:30.681 --> 33:31.810
Hey.

33:35.533 --> 33:38.970
What did that lady Melanie
talk to you about today?

33:39.403 --> 33:41.555
School, my friends.

33:42.782 --> 33:44.297
Did she ask about me?

33:45.245 --> 33:46.304
No.

33:46.877 --> 33:48.402
I don't remember.

33:58.474 --> 33:59.756
You know...

34:01.345 --> 34:02.810
when you talk to people like that,

34:02.812 --> 34:05.907
you just got to say you're really happy.

34:07.002 --> 34:09.469
You say you're happy and everything's okay.

34:09.469 --> 34:11.210
When you talk to the doctor,

34:13.002 --> 34:14.516
tell him the same thing.

34:14.746 --> 34:15.824
Why?

34:15.963 --> 34:17.763
Because people like that <i>seem</i> nice.

34:17.788 --> 34:20.475
They <i> seem</i> like they want
to help you, but they don't.

34:23.514 --> 34:25.445
So when you see her again,

34:26.385 --> 34:27.726
what are you gonna say?

34:28.446 --> 34:30.402
I'm happy. Everything is okay.

34:31.141 --> 34:32.284
Correct.

34:36.667 --> 34:38.208
What do you want for dinner?

34:38.937 --> 34:40.110
Spaghetti.

34:42.322 --> 34:43.788
Spaghetti. All right.

34:50.103 --> 34:52.103
_

34:55.620 --> 34:56.937
We got a problem.

34:57.288 --> 34:59.042
We've been lax on a few things...

34:59.300 --> 35:01.529
Things that are gonna come
back and bite us in the ass.

35:01.820 --> 35:02.819
Lax on what?

35:02.821 --> 35:03.815
Town shit.

35:03.840 --> 35:05.572
Stuff that we're supposed
to be taking care of

35:05.597 --> 35:06.817
but we're not.

35:07.426 --> 35:09.492
Now, you've been doing good
on that money shit, man,

35:09.494 --> 35:11.552
but public relations has suffered.

35:11.696 --> 35:13.563
I mean, look at everything
we do around here.

35:13.565 --> 35:17.367
Throw parties, loan money,
sponsor beach cleanups,

35:17.369 --> 35:19.561
make sure the kids get
decent boards to ride.

35:20.439 --> 35:22.172
Come on. You think we're
renting out those apartments

35:22.174 --> 35:24.439
for next to nothing out of
the goodness of our hearts?

35:24.708 --> 35:25.691
No.

35:26.267 --> 35:28.679
We live here, and people know what we do.

35:37.267 --> 35:38.927
Are you trying to get me shut down?

35:39.523 --> 35:40.722
Get her out of here.

35:40.724 --> 35:42.858
Hey, Lena, how about you have Kai

35:42.860 --> 35:44.482
make you a sandwich, okay?

35:46.162 --> 35:47.770
It's okay. Go ahead.

35:51.274 --> 35:52.262
What's up?

35:52.604 --> 35:55.204
We need to make a run
on some guys tonight...

35:55.365 --> 35:57.462
Tune 'em up, send a message.

35:57.634 --> 35:58.707
Tonight?

35:58.707 --> 36:00.891
Word around town is that
we're having some problems,

36:01.139 --> 36:04.327
that the Codys are distracted, weak.

36:05.130 --> 36:06.513
That makes us a target.

36:07.092 --> 36:09.210
Now, if we can't police Oceanside ourselves

36:09.235 --> 36:10.901
and stop other crews from coming in,

36:10.903 --> 36:12.205
that brings heat on us.

36:12.579 --> 36:14.174
So yeah... tonight.

36:15.492 --> 36:16.847
You cased the place?

36:16.849 --> 36:18.344
- Uh-huh.
- How many?

36:18.345 --> 36:19.660
Five, maybe six.

36:19.685 --> 36:20.735
"Maybe"?

36:23.417 --> 36:24.673
Well, we got four.

36:25.409 --> 36:27.211
As long as we surprise
'em, we should be good.

36:27.478 --> 36:30.251
No, you got <i> three.</i>
I got to take care of Lena.

36:31.347 --> 36:32.828
I'll drive, but that's it.

36:36.153 --> 36:37.809
All right, so it's three against five.

36:38.489 --> 36:40.076
We go in strong, all right?

36:44.324 --> 36:46.815
Relax, bro. You're gonna love it.

36:53.278 --> 36:54.944
Why can't I come with you?

36:54.969 --> 36:55.968
You just can't.

36:55.968 --> 36:57.216
So you're just gonna
leave me here all alone?

36:57.457 --> 36:58.857
Aren't Billy and Frankie here?

36:58.882 --> 37:00.276
Well, they went to go get tacos.

37:00.276 --> 37:01.508
They'll be back soon.

37:04.021 --> 37:05.675
What are we still doing here, J?

37:11.620 --> 37:13.420
This is bullshit. We talked about this.

37:13.422 --> 37:15.021
Yes, and I told you it's not that simple.

37:15.023 --> 37:17.291
So, what, you're just gonna do
everything that they tell you to do?

37:17.293 --> 37:18.692
You're just gonna be their bitch?

37:18.694 --> 37:19.893
Look, it's not my fault

37:19.895 --> 37:21.458
your family doesn't want you around, Nicky.

37:22.298 --> 37:23.725
Jesus, can you blame them?

37:30.795 --> 37:32.067
I'll be back soon.

38:45.270 --> 38:46.603
On your knees, assholes!

38:46.605 --> 38:47.870
- Let's go!
- Come on!

38:47.872 --> 38:49.539
Come on... down. Don't move.

38:49.541 --> 38:50.807
- On your knees!
- Get down.

38:50.809 --> 38:52.142
Hands behind your back, come on!

38:52.144 --> 38:53.476
- Secure?
- Yeah. We'll go check upstairs.

38:53.478 --> 38:54.522
All right.

38:59.618 --> 39:02.685
You're dead. You hear me? All of you.

39:02.687 --> 39:04.488
Oh, yeah?

39:06.824 --> 39:10.027
Are they almost done,
Uncle Pope? I have to pee.

39:12.030 --> 39:13.407
Yeah. Almost.

39:31.716 --> 39:34.727
Yo, J. Go check it out, go check it out!

39:43.328 --> 39:44.422
Aah!

39:47.132 --> 39:48.731
- Let's go!
- J, what's going on?

39:48.733 --> 39:49.852
Come on!

40:01.946 --> 40:02.945
Oh, yeah.

40:02.947 --> 40:04.080
Okay, let's go!

40:04.082 --> 40:05.761
- What you got?
- Whoo!

40:06.485 --> 40:08.284
There we go. Look at this!

40:08.286 --> 40:09.686
- I like that.
- Not bad.

40:09.688 --> 40:10.821
Not bad.

40:10.823 --> 40:11.949
Whoo!

40:15.645 --> 40:17.309
Stay out of Oceanside.

42:30.362 --> 42:32.295
That guy in the closet

42:32.297 --> 42:35.290
was like a Goddamn spider
monkey or something.

42:35.982 --> 42:38.205
Sounds like J saved your ass again.

42:38.528 --> 42:40.370
Right? Little psycho.

42:40.372 --> 42:42.522
Just hope it wasn't his jerking-off arm.

42:43.590 --> 42:44.657
I had him.

42:46.142 --> 42:48.445
Nah, you did good. Seriously.

42:48.447 --> 42:49.759
Hell yeah, you did.

42:50.182 --> 42:51.406
We <i> all</i> did good.

42:52.928 --> 42:54.991
But don't you see? This
is what it's all about.

42:55.331 --> 42:58.065
Us having each other's backs
and handling our own shit.

43:00.294 --> 43:01.861
We need another job.

43:06.007 --> 43:07.708
I might have something for us...

43:08.302 --> 43:09.672
If you guys are down.

43:10.320 --> 43:11.319
What is it?

43:11.321 --> 43:12.600
It's a weed farm.

43:13.870 --> 43:15.118
It's all cash.

43:15.525 --> 43:16.695
Could be big.

43:17.843 --> 43:18.901
Let's do it.

43:19.329 --> 43:20.928
That's what I'm talking about.

43:21.874 --> 43:23.340
Soon as I move this,

43:23.342 --> 43:25.342
I'll get us all some walking-around money.

43:25.344 --> 43:27.759
Yeah, right, you Goddamn degenerate.

43:44.899 --> 43:46.670
Holy shit! What happened?

43:50.703 --> 43:53.563
The gun went off. The gun went off.

44:02.781 --> 44:04.915
Stay with me, Nicky!
Stay with me! It's okay!

44:04.917 --> 44:06.246
I'm so sorry.

44:06.762 --> 44:08.296
I really messed up.

44:08.521 --> 44:11.608
You just have to promise me
that you won't let me die.

44:12.725 --> 44:15.459
Okay? Just don't... Don't let me die.

44:15.658 --> 44:17.259
I love you, okay?

44:17.850 --> 44:18.980
Just...

44:53.031 --> 44:54.352
Can you... J?

44:55.568 --> 44:57.868
Can you... Can you come back?

45:00.907 --> 45:02.083
J?
