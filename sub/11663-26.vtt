00:00.633 --> 00:02.967
(Rose) <i>On our last episode...</i>

00:03.033 --> 00:05.266
This man at the
produce counter

00:05.333 --> 00:07.367
asked me to play tennis
with him tonight,

00:07.433 --> 00:09.800
but I forgot that Big Daddy's
baby brother,

00:09.867 --> 00:13.767
my dearest and nearest relative,
is flying in at 7.

00:13.834 --> 00:16.800
This is such a dilemma.
Whatever am I going to do?

00:16.867 --> 00:18.467
Con Dorothy into it.

00:18.533 --> 00:21.700
Look, I only came
as a favor to Blanche.

00:21.767 --> 00:25.066
When she told me how badly
you were dying to meet me--

00:25.133 --> 00:28.967
Blanche told you
I was dying to meet you?

00:29.033 --> 00:30.066
The only reason I came was

00:30.133 --> 00:34.533
because she said you were a
lonely single gal dying to meet me.

00:34.600 --> 00:36.834
What do you have in mind?

00:36.900 --> 00:38.700
Why don't we make her think

00:38.767 --> 00:41.066
that you and I are
going to get married?

00:41.133 --> 00:43.500
To revenge.

00:44.700 --> 00:48.600
-Yes?
-Dorothy, will you marry me?

00:48.667 --> 00:50.633
Oh, Lucas!

00:50.700 --> 00:52.033
Oh, yes!

00:52.100 --> 00:57.033
Oh, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes!

00:57.100 --> 00:58.700
I'm not going to oppose this union.

00:58.767 --> 01:01.567
I'm going to celebrate it,
lift a glass to it,

01:01.633 --> 01:04.133
I'm going to ask God
to bless it.

01:04.200 --> 01:05.400
Dorothy...

01:07.633 --> 01:09.934
will you marry me for real?

01:14.233 --> 01:15.433
For real?

01:16.667 --> 01:17.600
For real.

01:19.500 --> 01:21.166
Oh, yes, Lucas.

01:21.233 --> 01:23.667
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

Great.
Nobody's home yet.

02:39.033 --> 02:42.333
It's the first time
since our engagement

02:42.400 --> 02:44.433
that we've had
a moment alone here.

02:44.500 --> 02:45.834
Well, let's not waste it.

02:48.166 --> 02:50.800
(click)

02:54.033 --> 02:56.433
I just love watching
you kids kiss.

02:56.500 --> 02:58.400
It's so beautiful to see.

02:58.467 --> 03:01.166
He loves you, pussycat.
He loves you.

03:01.233 --> 03:04.400
Luke, I don't feel like
I'm losing a daughter.

03:04.467 --> 03:06.834
I'm gaining a sucker, son.

03:08.567 --> 03:10.333
Son.
Where did that come from?

03:11.100 --> 03:13.100
Ah, the mind, huh?

03:13.166 --> 03:14.834
I can't wait to be your son.

03:14.900 --> 03:17.533
Oh, you are delightful.
Such a gem.

03:17.600 --> 03:19.867
Here. Get yourself a girl tonight.

03:21.667 --> 03:23.533
We'll understand.

03:24.567 --> 03:26.033
Ma, please.

03:26.100 --> 03:28.467
We're trying to have
a private moment.

03:28.533 --> 03:31.133
Private? Please, what's
private? I diapered you.

03:31.200 --> 03:33.000
Yeah, but you didn't diaper Lucas.

03:33.066 --> 03:34.867
I'd like to.

03:36.800 --> 03:39.633
Ah, I'm as giddy
as a 60-year-old.

03:41.633 --> 03:42.800
Honey, I'm glad you're ok.

03:42.867 --> 03:45.000
With ma's coming to live
with us in Atlanta.

03:45.066 --> 03:47.266
She'd be lost without me.

03:47.333 --> 03:49.233
My pleasure.

03:49.300 --> 03:51.000
I see how close you two are

03:51.066 --> 03:53.266
and how close you are
to Rose and Blanche.

03:53.333 --> 03:55.333
We've learned a lot
from each other.

03:55.400 --> 03:57.934
I mean, Ma taught me
life does not end

03:58.000 --> 04:00.433
because you've reached
a certain age.

04:00.500 --> 04:03.200
And I've become much more
comfortable with my sexuality

04:03.266 --> 04:04.433
because of Blanche.

04:04.500 --> 04:06.200
And Rose has taught me...

04:10.700 --> 04:12.834
Rose has taught me...

04:12.900 --> 04:13.867
It's not important.

04:13.934 --> 04:17.967
No, wait. No, I can do this.
Rose has taught me...

04:18.033 --> 04:22.200
-let it go.
-I need some time with this.

04:22.266 --> 04:26.367
Anyway, because of them,
I feel that I'm ready to love you.

04:26.433 --> 04:28.500
A square knot!

04:28.567 --> 04:30.800
Rose taught me
how to tie a square knot.

04:31.800 --> 04:34.934
Well, I'm glad somebody taught you
how to do this.

04:36.400 --> 04:38.100
(click)

04:39.200 --> 04:41.133
I just love to watch
you two kiss.

04:41.200 --> 04:43.000
The last picture was
a little blurry.

04:43.066 --> 04:44.500
It was hard to tell
who was who.

04:44.567 --> 04:46.900
No offense, pussycat.

04:46.967 --> 04:48.066
Pussycat, huh?

04:48.133 --> 04:50.333
Nobody's called me
that since the navy.

04:54.934 --> 04:57.100
He's just nuts enough

04:57.166 --> 04:59.200
to actually turn up
at the wedding tomorrow.

05:00.166 --> 05:03.166
You're a furry little gnome,
and we feed you too much.

05:07.700 --> 05:09.767
Oh, Dorothy. Good. You're here.

05:09.834 --> 05:11.000
Listen...

05:11.834 --> 05:15.400
well, this is going to be
our final night together here,

05:15.467 --> 05:20.033
and we thought it might be
our last chance to say--

05:20.100 --> 05:21.867
Don't say it.
Don't say goodbye.

05:21.934 --> 05:23.533
This is not goodbye.

05:23.600 --> 05:25.767
I don't want this to be a sad thing.

05:25.834 --> 05:27.300
Me, neither.

05:27.367 --> 05:30.233
I promised myself I wouldn't cry.

05:30.300 --> 05:32.266
I'm going to laugh instead.

05:32.333 --> 05:34.300
Tee-hee hee...
(sobbing)

05:36.033 --> 05:38.867
Now, to be honest,
it is a little difficult for me.

05:38.934 --> 05:41.133
Everything happened so fast.

05:41.200 --> 05:44.533
My God, you and Lucas probably
haven't even slept together yet.

05:46.600 --> 05:48.500
Blanche, don't be ridiculous.

05:48.567 --> 05:50.233
I mean,
I know he's your uncle,

05:50.300 --> 05:53.433
but you have to realize
that we're both adults

05:53.500 --> 05:57.767
and capable of a caring,
warm relationship.

05:57.834 --> 05:59.200
How was the sex?

06:00.767 --> 06:03.734
So good we named it!

06:07.700 --> 06:11.233
(mellow music playing)

06:14.734 --> 06:17.033
I thought I might
find you out here.

06:17.100 --> 06:18.500
You ok?

06:18.567 --> 06:21.667
I couldn't sleep. I'm just...

06:22.734 --> 06:25.033
I'm just so mad at Dorothy.

06:25.100 --> 06:26.767
I mean, she won't
let us say goodbye,

06:26.834 --> 06:31.200
and I'm sorry, but I need to,
especially to you.

06:31.266 --> 06:33.800
I know, Rose,
but you know what?

06:33.867 --> 06:36.066
Dorothy's not here right now.

06:37.066 --> 06:40.900
Yeah... and if she was, what's
the worst thing she could do to us?

06:41.000 --> 06:43.767
Right.
Can she intimidate us?

06:43.834 --> 06:45.367
Could she physically harm us?

06:45.433 --> 06:47.367
Can she make life
miserable for us?

06:47.433 --> 06:49.066
Blanche, she can do
all those things.

06:49.133 --> 06:51.834
I know it, it know it. But...

06:51.900 --> 06:54.500
Oh, I'm going to miss you, honey.

06:54.567 --> 06:57.900
Oh, I'm going to miss you.

06:57.967 --> 07:00.934
(click)

07:01.000 --> 07:03.367
I just love to watch you... whoa!

07:12.100 --> 07:13.533
What is this, Wimbledon?

07:18.333 --> 07:19.700
Oh, Sophia.

07:19.767 --> 07:20.500
Stop that.

07:20.567 --> 07:24.033
Ah, Sophia, I'm glad you're here.

07:26.367 --> 07:29.834
You know I'm moving in
with Kirsten tomorrow,

07:29.900 --> 07:33.667
and in a way, I'm going to be
the Sophia of that household.

07:33.734 --> 07:37.734
And... well, how do you do it?

07:37.800 --> 07:40.300
You're talking to your loved ones.

07:40.367 --> 07:41.867
Complete this sentence.

07:41.934 --> 07:45.433
"I'm tired of spending time
with you miserable..."

07:45.500 --> 07:49.767
a, gypsies,
b, bottom feeders,

07:49.834 --> 07:52.567
c, howler monkeys.

07:52.633 --> 07:54.300
Howler monkeys.

07:54.367 --> 07:56.100
-Howler monkeys?
-(Rose) Mm-hmm.

07:56.166 --> 07:58.767
The correct answer
is c, howler monkeys!

07:58.834 --> 08:00.967
Yes!

08:01.033 --> 08:04.367
No, I can't do this.

08:04.433 --> 08:07.834
Oh, this isn't who I am.

08:07.900 --> 08:10.367
Sophia, you can
speak your mind

08:10.433 --> 08:13.033
because you know
you're needed around here,

08:13.100 --> 08:15.000
but Kirsten has her own family.

08:15.066 --> 08:17.166
I'll just be baggage there.

08:17.233 --> 08:19.300
I know a place
where you're needed.

08:19.367 --> 08:20.266
Where?

08:22.266 --> 08:24.767
Here, Rose.

08:24.834 --> 08:26.967
Oh, stay with me, honey.

08:28.200 --> 08:29.567
Blanche, that's very nice,

08:29.633 --> 08:31.567
but you're going
to want your own life.

08:31.633 --> 08:33.900
You'll want to find a relationship.

08:33.967 --> 08:38.300
I want my best friend here.
I need you in my life, Rose.

08:38.367 --> 08:41.233
You need each other.
Stay, Rose.

08:41.300 --> 08:43.500
This is your family now.

08:44.433 --> 08:45.333
Well...

08:46.800 --> 08:48.900
we do have a lot
in common.

08:48.967 --> 08:51.967
Yeah, you're both
natural brunettes.

08:55.834 --> 08:58.834
Come on. Get some rest.
Tomorrow's a big day.

08:58.900 --> 09:01.600
Thank you.
Thank you, Sophia.

09:01.667 --> 09:03.066
(giggling)

09:09.767 --> 09:11.367
(deep sigh)

09:12.133 --> 09:13.734
Goodbye, my girls.

09:18.200 --> 09:20.100
(soft music playing)

09:25.633 --> 09:28.200
It was so sweet of Lucas to do this.

09:28.266 --> 09:31.567
Guess he wanted to make sure
I got to the church on time.

09:31.633 --> 09:33.900
Oh, what a darling.

09:36.433 --> 09:39.367
Actually, I think maple is quicker.

09:39.433 --> 09:41.600
This heads out to the expressway.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.033
Driver?

09:45.100 --> 09:47.667
Driver, you're headed
for the expressway.

09:47.734 --> 09:49.266
Why don't you turn around?

09:50.133 --> 09:51.000
Driver?

09:51.066 --> 09:52.767
Driver, stop.

09:54.333 --> 09:56.367
Driver, I said stop!

09:57.133 --> 10:00.266
Driver, who the hell do you
think you are?

10:15.633 --> 10:20.367
Stanley, what are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?

10:20.433 --> 10:23.166
You're ruining
the biggest day of my life!

10:26.433 --> 10:28.867
You're getting married,
and you couldn't send an invitation

10:28.934 --> 10:32.033
to Stanley Zbornak, the man
who gave you his name?

10:32.100 --> 10:35.533
I'm sorry.
The list was alphabetical.

10:35.600 --> 10:38.467
The Zionists aren't
speaking to me either.

10:40.066 --> 10:42.533
Stanley,
what do you want from me?

10:42.600 --> 10:44.834
I want to show you something.

10:44.900 --> 10:47.667
Dorothy, you see this hair?

10:47.734 --> 10:50.633
It is the only one
on my forehead.

10:50.700 --> 10:52.767
The other traitors
receded years ago,

10:52.834 --> 10:57.767
but this proud and loyal sprout
clings desperately.

10:57.834 --> 10:59.800
It is unrelenting.

10:59.867 --> 11:01.734
It is true.

11:02.233 --> 11:03.333
What about it?

11:03.400 --> 11:08.800
Dorothy, it is this hair that
I hate more than all the others.

11:08.867 --> 11:10.633
It mocks me.

11:11.734 --> 11:13.567
You're psychotic.

11:15.233 --> 11:16.367
Because I'm bald?

11:16.433 --> 11:18.500
Because you're kidnapping me!

11:18.567 --> 11:20.633
I'm not kidnapping you.

11:20.700 --> 11:24.000
I'm taking you to church...
in style.

11:25.367 --> 11:26.633
You are?

11:26.700 --> 11:28.900
This is my gift to you.

11:30.633 --> 11:33.867
I just wanted a minute alone
with you

11:33.934 --> 11:36.700
to give my blessings,
to show I care.

11:38.166 --> 11:39.467
Don't you see?

11:39.533 --> 11:42.033
I am that hair

11:42.100 --> 11:46.834
and you're my big,
crazy bald skull.

11:50.100 --> 11:52.033
All right, Stanley. The truth.

11:55.700 --> 11:57.700
Things have been going
so well with Lucas,

11:57.767 --> 12:01.633
I didn't want to deal with you,
but as Freud said...

12:03.000 --> 12:04.667
our beds are crowded.

12:05.900 --> 12:08.200
When I sleep with Lucas,
I'm not alone.

12:09.100 --> 12:11.834
There's this phantom
of you there,

12:11.900 --> 12:15.500
and he has the haunts
of his prior relationships.

12:15.567 --> 12:17.033
And, well, I...

12:18.700 --> 12:20.900
well, I can't pretend
you're not a part of me.

12:22.200 --> 12:25.767
So, what are you saying,
you slept with this guy?

12:28.900 --> 12:31.934
Stanley, you're missing my point.
We named it!

12:35.266 --> 12:36.700
What I'm saying is...

12:38.400 --> 12:40.000
thank you.

12:40.066 --> 12:41.967
Stanley, for the first
time in a long while,

12:42.033 --> 12:46.200
you're really acting like a man.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.000
I love you, Dorothy.

12:48.066 --> 12:49.800
I've always loved you.

12:49.867 --> 12:52.200
And I love you, Stanley.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.500
Now drive.

12:59.800 --> 13:02.233
("The Wedding March" plays)

13:10.734 --> 13:14.300
<i>I can't believe it. This is for me.</i>

13:14.367 --> 13:16.834
<i>They're standing for me.</i>

13:16.900 --> 13:19.533
<i>My good friends. Oh, God.</i>

13:19.600 --> 13:22.066
<i>I wonder what they're thinking.</i>

13:22.133 --> 13:24.100
<i>My baby's getting married.</i>

13:24.166 --> 13:25.700
<i>This is too much.</i>

13:25.767 --> 13:27.667
<i>I'm overcome.</i>

13:27.734 --> 13:29.867
<i>I'm about to cry.</i>

13:29.934 --> 13:31.000
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

13:31.066 --> 13:33.133
<i>I'm actually about to cry.</i>

13:33.200 --> 13:34.467
Ah-choo!

13:35.433 --> 13:37.533
<i>Wow! Misjudged that one.</i>

13:41.500 --> 13:43.066
<i>Oh, look at her.</i>

13:43.133 --> 13:46.000
<i>I've never seen</i>
<i>Dorothy look so happy.</i>

13:46.066 --> 13:49.333
<i>Ok, that once, but she</i>
<i>didn't know I was watching.</i>

13:52.100 --> 13:55.300
<i>And she looks</i>
<i>so beautiful.</i>

13:55.367 --> 13:58.233
<i>Oh, God. If a woman with all</i>
<i>my gifts is jealous of her,</i>

13:58.300 --> 14:02.400
<i>I can't imagine what a woman</i>
<i>like Rose must be thinking.</i>

14:02.467 --> 14:04.567
<i>♪ Hi-ho the Derry-o ♪</i>

14:04.633 --> 14:06.667
<i>♪ The farmer in the dell ♪</i>

14:06.734 --> 14:11.900
<i>Oh, and there's Lucas,</i>
<i>so handsome, so strong.</i>

14:11.967 --> 14:14.867
<i>And he's right here with me.</i>

14:14.934 --> 14:18.033
<i>Lucas, you can probably hear</i>
<i>every word I'm thinking.</i>

14:18.100 --> 14:20.300
<i>Yes, Dorothy, I can.</i>

14:27.100 --> 14:31.400
<i>Remember, ESP,</i>
<i>energy, smile, personality!</i>

14:31.467 --> 14:33.166
<i>They like me!</i>

14:33.667 --> 14:36.567
Dearly beloved,
we are assembled here

14:36.633 --> 14:39.066
in the sight of God
and these witnesses

14:39.133 --> 14:42.500
to join this man
and this woman in matrimony,

14:42.567 --> 14:44.433
to marry them, husband and wife.

14:44.500 --> 14:50.667
<i>I'm here. I'm standing here,</i>
<i>and he's standing there.</i>

14:50.734 --> 14:52.533
<i>And I actually love him.</i>

14:52.600 --> 14:56.333
<i>I love the man</i>
<i>and not out of desperation.</i>

14:56.400 --> 15:00.700
<i>Dorothy Zbornak has finally</i>
<i>conquered her desperation!</i>

15:01.233 --> 15:02.867
-Dorothy--
-I do!

15:02.934 --> 15:05.433
(laughter)

15:09.100 --> 15:12.367
Well, what the heck?
I do too.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
<i>God, I love this man.</i>

15:17.066 --> 15:18.667
Hey, you two.

15:18.734 --> 15:21.233
You're not married until I say so.

15:21.300 --> 15:22.900
(laughter)

15:22.967 --> 15:26.333
<i>They love me.</i>
<i>These people love me!</i>

15:26.834 --> 15:29.800
Dorothy and Lucas,
will you please join hands?

15:34.400 --> 15:37.700
Lucas, do you take this woman
to be your wedded wife?

15:37.767 --> 15:40.100
Do you promise to love
and cherish her

15:40.166 --> 15:42.367
as long as you both shall live?

15:42.433 --> 15:43.867
I do.

15:43.934 --> 15:47.700
Dorothy, do you take this man
to be your wedded husband?

15:47.767 --> 15:50.367
Do you promise to love
and cherish him

15:50.433 --> 15:51.834
as long as you both shall live?

15:51.900 --> 15:53.633
I do.

15:53.700 --> 15:55.600
May we have the ring, please?

15:55.667 --> 15:58.033
Repeat after me.

15:58.100 --> 16:03.066
With this ring, I thee wed.

16:08.934 --> 16:13.467
And I pledge my love and loyalty
in the name of the Lord.

16:13.533 --> 16:15.467
Amen.

16:15.533 --> 16:18.800
Then unless anyone
has cause for objection...

16:20.300 --> 16:24.300
by the power vested in me by God
and the state of Florida,

16:24.367 --> 16:27.400
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

16:27.467 --> 16:29.834
Lucas, you may kiss the bride.

16:45.867 --> 16:49.734
<i>Oh, no. Of all the times for me</i>
<i>to feel a sneeze coming on.</i>

16:53.500 --> 16:55.800
(sobbing)
<i>I'll be damned.</i>

17:11.266 --> 17:15.166
Dorothy, I want to tell you
something, and this isn't easy.

17:15.233 --> 17:17.333
Not easy? For you?
Please.

17:17.400 --> 17:19.533
The day you stop
speaking your mind--

17:19.600 --> 17:20.567
I'm not going.

17:22.133 --> 17:23.266
What?

17:23.333 --> 17:27.266
I'm not going with you, pussycat.
I'm staying here with the girls.

17:27.333 --> 17:28.533
The girls?

17:28.600 --> 17:30.333
Rose, Blanche.
Whatever they are.

17:33.767 --> 17:37.000
We discussed it after the wedding,
and they need me.

17:37.066 --> 17:39.300
Ma, I need you.

17:39.367 --> 17:43.967
No, no. You need to be married now,
alone.

17:44.033 --> 17:46.834
Frankly, I think I was
in the way the first time.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.600
Oh, no, you weren't.

17:48.667 --> 17:50.000
Yes, you were.

17:51.333 --> 17:53.166
It's time to leave the nest,

17:53.233 --> 17:56.100
and I've given you
the self-confidence to do that.

17:57.233 --> 17:59.133
I do want you to know
that without you

17:59.200 --> 18:01.133
and Blanche and Rose,

18:01.200 --> 18:03.700
I never would have been ready
to try.

18:04.934 --> 18:07.266
There's something
I want to tell you.

18:07.333 --> 18:11.200
It's been my great privilege
to be your friend as an adult,

18:11.266 --> 18:13.033
to spend these years with you.

18:13.100 --> 18:15.600
No, Ma.
It was my privilege.

18:19.333 --> 18:20.734
And something else.

18:22.133 --> 18:27.133
And that self-confidence
is the greatest gift

18:27.200 --> 18:29.767
that you could have
ever given me.

18:31.767 --> 18:33.166
Yeah. I agree.

18:33.233 --> 18:36.367
Yes. It's a magnificent gift.

18:43.700 --> 18:45.734
-You got everything you need?
-Yeah.

18:45.800 --> 18:49.266
The honeymoon will be great,
me, Dorothy, and Freddy Peterson.

18:49.333 --> 18:50.367
Who's Freddy Peterson?

18:50.433 --> 18:52.066
That's what we named it.

18:55.700 --> 18:58.100
Oh!

19:02.133 --> 19:03.400
Oh.

19:15.066 --> 19:17.900
I have packed my last suitcase.

19:17.967 --> 19:21.066
-You ready, Dorothy?
-Ready, Freddy.

19:22.600 --> 19:24.600
Dorothy, they know.

19:27.567 --> 19:29.033
Oh.

19:30.700 --> 19:32.800
I'll be out in just a minute.

19:34.166 --> 19:35.100
Ok.

19:45.300 --> 19:46.200
Well...

19:46.266 --> 19:48.100
Yeah. Well.

19:49.533 --> 19:51.500
Yeah.

19:51.567 --> 19:53.467
I guess this is it.

19:53.533 --> 19:56.734
Right. Listen--

19:56.800 --> 19:58.900
Dorothy,
you don't have to say anything.

19:58.967 --> 20:04.567
I mean, what can you say about seven
years of fights and laughter,

20:04.633 --> 20:06.033
secrets?

20:06.100 --> 20:07.667
Cheesecake?

20:08.166 --> 20:09.767
Just that...

20:10.834 --> 20:12.166
it's been very...

20:14.100 --> 20:15.333
well, it's been an experience

20:15.400 --> 20:17.867
that I'll always keep
very close to my heart...

20:19.533 --> 20:22.433
and that these are memories that...

20:23.800 --> 20:28.166
I'll wrap myself
in when the world gets cold

20:28.233 --> 20:34.800
and I forget that there are people
who are warm and loving and...

20:35.834 --> 20:37.600
We love you too.

20:38.633 --> 20:43.133
-Oh!
-I'll miss you.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.800
(Blanche) You will always be
a part of us.

20:47.900 --> 20:52.600
Your friendship was something
I never expected

20:52.667 --> 20:54.633
at this point in my life,

20:54.700 --> 20:59.166
and I could never have asked
for a better surprise.

20:59.233 --> 21:01.000
(Blanche)
That's how we feel too.

21:02.734 --> 21:04.000
I have to go.

21:04.934 --> 21:06.000
Dorothy?

21:06.066 --> 21:07.633
This is goodbye?

21:14.367 --> 21:15.567
I love you...

21:16.233 --> 21:17.300
always.

21:31.967 --> 21:33.734
Oh, God.
I love you so much.

21:33.800 --> 21:35.467
Oh, Dorothy!

21:35.533 --> 21:37.734
Oh, Dorothy. Dorothy.

21:38.734 --> 21:43.166
Oh. Listen...
Lucas is waiting.

21:47.033 --> 21:50.367
You're angels... all of you.

22:03.533 --> 22:06.700
Oh, God.
I'm going to miss you!

22:06.767 --> 22:08.700
Oh!

22:08.767 --> 22:12.033
Dorothy!

22:14.033 --> 22:17.000
Oh, listen. We have a flight.

22:20.033 --> 22:22.133
You'll always be my sisters.

22:23.567 --> 22:24.967
Always.

23:08.400 --> 23:12.700
(theme music playing)
