00:00.540 --> 00:01.777
I'm concerned about the captain

00:01.901 --> 00:02.872
and the decisions he's been making.

00:02.988 --> 00:04.120
You're talking about mutiny.

00:04.255 --> 00:06.324
Whoever drew
the short straws will be lashed.

00:06.501 --> 00:08.459
Senior Chief Petty Officer
Harold Anders,

00:08.580 --> 00:09.880
you are hereby relieved of duty.

00:09.990 --> 00:10.997
I'll see you in hell, Sir.

00:11.106 --> 00:13.104
What I propose is a partnership.

00:13.213 --> 00:14.769
We can take care
of this island together.

00:14.883 --> 00:17.197
There's a future.
Maybe I'll be part of it.

00:17.302 --> 00:19.651
There are powerful people
organizing a coup d'etat.

00:19.752 --> 00:21.621
<i>May God help us all.</i>

00:21.730 --> 00:22.907
Oh, no.

00:22.997 --> 00:25.760
The only mistake you made
was being on the losing side.

00:25.865 --> 00:27.446
Tell me from your gut that I'm wrong,

00:27.577 --> 00:29.657
because this is happening,
one way or the other.

00:29.763 --> 00:30.789
I know what you're up to, Joe.

00:30.889 --> 00:31.696
You want to wear the big hat?

00:31.798 --> 00:33.024
Come take it off my head.

00:33.127 --> 00:34.306
I've got Prosser and his men.

00:34.412 --> 00:35.856
I've got Lieutenant Shepard
and the sub.

00:35.974 --> 00:38.236
Lieutenant Shepard, I need you
to declare your intentions.

00:38.351 --> 00:40.517
Fire one flare if you're with the XO.

00:40.630 --> 00:42.176
Two flares if you're with me.

00:42.355 --> 00:44.606
Thanks for cooperating.
Kind of perfect, isn't it,

00:44.719 --> 00:47.023
you being the one to bring
the captain to me?

01:02.150 --> 01:03.498
Wes.

01:05.498 --> 01:06.791
Been a long time.

01:07.207 --> 01:08.938
You a bag man now, Hop?

01:09.321 --> 01:10.877
You a kidnapper?

01:12.975 --> 01:14.505
Guess we've both seen better days.

01:17.756 --> 01:19.176
Money's good.

01:21.159 --> 01:22.304
Where is she?

01:23.601 --> 01:24.701
Take care of her.

01:24.792 --> 01:26.375
She didn't deserve this.

01:43.221 --> 01:44.984
I pledge allegiance to the flag

01:45.092 --> 01:47.702
of the United States of America...

01:48.756 --> 01:50.276
and to the republic
for which it stands.

01:50.398 --> 01:51.819
You remember that, Marcus?

01:52.305 --> 01:54.486
Come on, Sir.
Give us a speech.

01:54.598 --> 01:56.242
Call me a traitor.
Call me a liar.

01:56.341 --> 01:57.477
You're quite the coward.

01:57.601 --> 01:59.052
Coward.

01:59.369 --> 02:01.672
Ah, I didn't see
that one coming. Touche, Sir.

02:01.900 --> 02:03.410
I expected as much from the COB.

02:03.692 --> 02:04.581
At least he had the nerve

02:04.699 --> 02:05.924
to come to me and tell me to my face.

02:06.025 --> 02:08.872
The rest of 'em? Opportunists,
scared, impressionable kids.

02:08.985 --> 02:11.125
But you? You don't have
the luxury of those excuses.

02:11.254 --> 02:12.898
I don't need any excuse.
I didn't want any excuse.

02:13.005 --> 02:14.017
I didn't tell you about the mutiny

02:14.123 --> 02:15.673
because I couldn't be certain
of your response.

02:15.770 --> 02:17.554
Oh, I would've done what was necessary.

02:17.661 --> 02:19.036
See, that's not comforting
coming from the man

02:19.146 --> 02:20.761
who flogged his own men like animals

02:20.940 --> 02:22.441
and rolled out
the red carpet for Zheng.

02:22.541 --> 02:23.685
It's that or starve.

02:23.800 --> 02:25.032
Well, then we should've starved

02:25.153 --> 02:26.355
and left.

02:27.896 --> 02:30.675
I mean, what is-- what is this
place to you, Marcus, huh?

02:31.059 --> 02:32.356
For the rest of us,
this is just a stop.

02:32.471 --> 02:34.266
For you, this is your new home,
isn't it?

02:34.380 --> 02:37.474
Marcus-stan.
Population-- 1.

02:38.332 --> 02:39.678
Lieutenant Cahill.

02:43.751 --> 02:45.973
Captain, the EWS
just picked something up

02:46.090 --> 02:47.207
on radar.

02:48.156 --> 02:49.639
Chaplin.

02:53.010 --> 02:55.144
There are three warships
converging on my island.

02:55.278 --> 02:56.721
I will not accept Chinese troops here.

02:56.832 --> 02:58.285
I thought I made myself
perfectly clear.

02:58.403 --> 03:00.006
Last night, your crew
made it very clear

03:00.124 --> 03:02.480
you're not able to maintain
order on Sainte Marina.

03:02.580 --> 03:04.603
Turn your ships back
or explain to your superiors

03:04.717 --> 03:06.438
why I'm targeting Shanghai
with a trident.

03:06.542 --> 03:07.913
Our countries are on the brink of a war

03:08.023 --> 03:09.440
that could be triggered
by any uncertainty.

03:09.564 --> 03:11.455
Will you be the one to tip the balance?

03:11.566 --> 03:13.527
You're threatening me
with a nuclear war?

03:13.651 --> 03:15.248
I'm sorry, Marcus.

03:15.873 --> 03:17.062
It was just a matter of time

03:17.179 --> 03:19.000
before someone called your bluff.

03:20.327 --> 03:21.512
Cahill,

03:21.914 --> 03:24.440
I'm headed to the Colorado
to engage the Chinese fleet.

03:24.556 --> 03:26.744
- You take the rest of the men
and secure the EWS. - Aye, Sir.

03:26.854 --> 03:28.043
Cortez.

03:28.791 --> 03:30.546
If you so much as smell mutiny on him,

03:30.696 --> 03:32.647
take command by any means.

03:33.310 --> 03:34.647
Sir, what about the XO?

03:35.783 --> 03:37.527
He's with me.

03:41.064 --> 03:43.056
Lock the former XO in here.

03:43.622 --> 03:45.225
Establish communications with EWS.

03:45.347 --> 03:46.704
This is a combat mission.

03:46.799 --> 03:48.232
They're coming, aren't they?

03:49.103 --> 03:51.215
I want a guard on him at all times.

03:55.277 --> 03:56.024
Lieutenant Shepard,

03:56.131 --> 03:57.459
the underway watch stations
are unmanned.

03:59.134 --> 04:00.470
Sorry, Sir.

04:01.208 --> 04:02.705
There were too many.

04:05.921 --> 04:08.004
I guess we're gonna do it
your way after all, COB.

04:10.993 --> 04:12.910
By article 10-88
of the Naval Code,

04:13.028 --> 04:14.888
I relieve you of your command, Sir.

04:15.002 --> 04:17.699
On your orders,
the boat's been emptied.

04:17.817 --> 04:20.021
The last watch is being
sent to shore as we speak.

04:20.130 --> 04:21.933
In five hours, we'll rendezvous
with the US fleet

04:22.040 --> 04:24.180
and put this whole
sorry episode behind us.

04:24.304 --> 04:26.593
I'm gonna need
your firing key, Captain.

04:31.425 --> 04:33.693
And the one you took off the XO.

04:40.152 --> 04:41.191
What should we do with him?

04:41.337 --> 04:42.777
Float check that son of a bitch.

04:42.890 --> 04:45.865
You touch him, and you'll need
a turkey baster to have kids.

04:46.993 --> 04:48.686
Sir, if you'll kindly follow me.

04:59.532 --> 05:00.736
COB just took Chaplin below.

05:00.864 --> 05:02.553
How long to get the Perseus
online, Chief?

05:02.666 --> 05:04.120
It'll take as long as it takes.

05:04.238 --> 05:06.009
Just be ready on your end.

05:09.541 --> 05:11.557
Your men are a bunch
of mercenaries, Joe.

05:11.666 --> 05:12.779
You know better than to
trust these--

05:12.894 --> 05:14.091
Save it.

05:15.115 --> 05:17.545
My men may be young,
dumb, and undisciplined,

05:17.661 --> 05:19.394
but at least they don't
conspire with foreign nationals

05:19.521 --> 05:21.015
to sell out their country.

05:24.614 --> 05:25.606
If you're meeting the blockade,

05:25.730 --> 05:27.201
why prepare the Perseus, COB?

05:28.369 --> 05:29.947
Who you planning on hiding from?

05:30.418 --> 05:31.799
You know anything about this?

05:31.908 --> 05:33.066
No, COB.

05:35.248 --> 05:36.485
Keep your distance.

05:36.594 --> 05:37.595
The little one knows karate,

05:37.716 --> 05:39.659
and the big one fights dirty.

05:46.761 --> 05:48.478
Don't say a word.

05:49.054 --> 05:50.091
I track three Chinese vessels

05:50.214 --> 05:51.658
on intercept with the Colorado.

05:52.115 --> 05:53.440
I have lost contact.

05:53.585 --> 05:56.338
Colorado, this is EWS.
Please respond.

05:56.466 --> 05:57.652
Colorado--

05:58.189 --> 06:00.385
Get out. This is
a secure facility.

06:00.516 --> 06:01.839
Does Julian know what you're doing?

06:01.951 --> 06:02.904
Yes, he does.

06:03.023 --> 06:05.531
Ah, ah. Everything is
changing today, Sophie.

06:05.656 --> 06:08.167
Ms. Girard,
apologies for the intrusion.

06:08.393 --> 06:10.845
These are the transponder codes
for three of my ships.

06:11.036 --> 06:12.398
You'll guide them
to the rendezvous point

06:12.513 --> 06:14.725
where they will meet
the Colorado and board her.

06:15.389 --> 06:16.711
Julian, what are you doing?

06:16.823 --> 06:17.738
What I do best,

06:17.843 --> 06:19.544
providing a valuable service
to a paying client.

06:19.672 --> 06:20.420
You promised.

06:20.561 --> 06:22.159
And you promised as well, Sophie.

06:22.269 --> 06:23.287
We both promised.

06:23.433 --> 06:24.499
Marcus Chaplin and his XO

06:24.624 --> 06:26.565
will be welcomed
by my country as heroes.

06:26.682 --> 06:27.593
He's lying.

06:27.704 --> 06:28.976
They'll send the captain
and the XO to prison

06:29.105 --> 06:30.760
and trot them out for propaganda.

06:30.878 --> 06:31.711
Don't touch her!

06:31.821 --> 06:34.626
Ms. Girard, please.

06:34.722 --> 06:35.776
It's not easy,

06:35.888 --> 06:38.651
but it is the best thing
we can do for Marcus now.

06:53.301 --> 06:54.707
What happened?

06:55.244 --> 06:56.821
Fix it now.

06:57.392 --> 06:58.482
Never.

07:03.935 --> 07:05.354
We should have
those coordinates by now.

07:05.477 --> 07:06.711
I can't get through to EWS.

07:06.811 --> 07:09.889
Ma'am, please get communications
back online.

07:14.145 --> 07:16.246
You know, just between
you and me, Lieutenant,

07:16.368 --> 07:17.147
I always thought you were

07:17.290 --> 07:19.085
the hottest piece of ass on this boat.

07:23.731 --> 07:25.258
Don't.

07:25.616 --> 07:26.741
What kind of grab-ass mission

07:26.858 --> 07:28.319
do you think we're running here, huh?

07:28.885 --> 07:30.844
Can anyone tell me
why we're going southwest

07:30.963 --> 07:33.784
when the closest American vessel
is due east of our position?

07:33.908 --> 07:35.119
We're not meeting the blockade.

07:35.273 --> 07:37.572
Are you out of
your glue-sniffing mind?

07:37.734 --> 07:39.339
That way is home, son.

07:39.449 --> 07:40.256
Home?

07:40.362 --> 07:41.447
Oh, yeah, the people who
left us starving

07:41.562 --> 07:42.965
and dying on that island, COB?

07:43.081 --> 07:44.791
Called all of us traitors?

07:44.993 --> 07:46.584
And now we're supposed to
go back for what, a medal,

07:46.676 --> 07:49.100
a handshake, and a night shift
at a big-box store?

07:49.250 --> 07:51.580
Do you have any idea what
Zheng offered us for this sub?

07:51.679 --> 07:53.781
Enough to make every one of us
richer than Jay-Z.

07:53.936 --> 07:55.259
Who?

07:59.140 --> 08:01.071
Stand down, COB.

08:03.147 --> 08:04.698
Let him go or we'll shoot you.

08:04.815 --> 08:06.177
Anders?

08:06.991 --> 08:08.624
Who the hell let you on the boat?

08:09.037 --> 08:10.079
Ohh!

08:18.921 --> 08:20.521
Go after her!

08:35.381 --> 08:36.481
Shit!

08:37.580 --> 08:38.783
Move!

08:50.103 --> 08:51.328
You can't stay in there forever.

08:51.457 --> 08:53.342
Come on, princess.

08:54.267 --> 08:56.374
We're going to get in there
one way or another.

08:59.498 --> 09:02.269
- A screwdriver?
- Yeah.

09:05.363 --> 09:07.441
You know how I feel about
uniform regulations.

09:07.554 --> 09:09.329
Yeah, we gotta get
this thing out of you.

09:09.703 --> 09:11.375
I'm still gonna have to write you up.

09:11.495 --> 09:12.793
All right, don't you bleed out on me.

09:12.899 --> 09:14.042
I don't want you getting red,
white, and blue

09:14.129 --> 09:15.019
all over my submarine.

09:15.135 --> 09:16.926
On three. Ready? One...

09:17.091 --> 09:18.696
two, three.

09:18.803 --> 09:21.568
Ohh! Ah, God!

09:28.780 --> 09:30.157
Sounds like you got a little mutiny

09:30.282 --> 09:32.478
in your mutiny, Kowalski.

09:32.834 --> 09:34.767
I make that last turn 45 seconds,

09:35.000 --> 09:37.253
which puts our heading
south by southwest.

09:38.181 --> 09:39.435
Why?

09:42.393 --> 09:43.496
Before we left,

09:43.610 --> 09:47.285
the EWS tracked three
inbound Chinese vessels.

09:49.245 --> 09:50.598
They're taking the island.

09:50.711 --> 09:52.075
No, they're taking the sub.

09:52.189 --> 09:54.679
Well, yeah.

10:01.143 --> 10:02.612
Who are you, Sam?

10:03.542 --> 10:05.460
I honestly don't know anymore.

10:06.432 --> 10:08.533
Are you with Prosser and his mutiny?

10:08.677 --> 10:10.398
You're not?

10:10.590 --> 10:12.781
You're the XO of the Colorado?

10:13.100 --> 10:15.528
But, no, the rank's empty
without the man.

10:15.639 --> 10:17.203
The man doesn't have
what it takes to lead,

10:17.313 --> 10:18.633
to see clearly what needs to be done

10:18.740 --> 10:19.557
and to do it.

10:19.653 --> 10:21.885
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You talking
about sacrifice again?

10:22.644 --> 10:23.935
Is that what they are to you,

10:24.087 --> 10:26.510
some necessary loss in the sake
of your damn cause?

10:26.617 --> 10:28.421
At least I know what I stand for.

10:28.544 --> 10:29.742
Do you?

10:30.010 --> 10:33.125
You don't mean anything, Sam.

10:33.282 --> 10:34.760
You suffered a loss?

10:34.864 --> 10:35.851
We all did.

10:35.951 --> 10:36.975
But you let it break you.

10:37.074 --> 10:39.316
Oh, you ran off,
let the COB twist your mind.

10:39.422 --> 10:40.806
No, no, no, no.
Nobody broke me.

10:40.911 --> 10:41.975
Nobody twisted my mind.

10:42.092 --> 10:43.929
I watched you.
I observed you.

10:44.276 --> 10:45.189
Who's the one that taught me

10:45.287 --> 10:46.443
that some orders should be refused?

10:46.555 --> 10:47.392
You did.

10:47.514 --> 10:49.154
But God forbid it's your
judgment that I question.

10:49.262 --> 10:51.119
- I did what was necessary!
- Well, good for you!

10:51.250 --> 10:53.378
Then the history books will
judge you kindly, won't they?

10:53.483 --> 10:55.005
'Cause that's what you
really want, isn't it?

10:55.149 --> 10:56.779
"He was the captain
that never compromised.

10:56.900 --> 10:59.233
Sure, all his men died,
but he was a great man."

10:59.420 --> 11:01.577
Some battles you cannot win.

11:02.072 --> 11:03.250
Do you hear yourself, XO?

11:03.360 --> 11:04.502
No, I hear myself.

11:04.645 --> 11:06.484
I hear myself loud and clear.

11:06.612 --> 11:08.490
Sometimes a leader needs to
lay down on his sword

11:08.618 --> 11:09.636
for the good of his people.

11:09.760 --> 11:11.994
Redmond, Willard, Trevor, Morales--

11:12.091 --> 11:13.955
Augustino, Cress,
Stanz, Mills--

11:14.062 --> 11:16.175
They didn't die so that
we could go home in chains,

11:16.305 --> 11:17.876
our heads bowed to a lie!

11:18.008 --> 11:19.008
But what did they die for?

11:19.123 --> 11:21.409
And you disgrace every one of them

11:21.537 --> 11:24.136
- by not being man enough...
- What did they die for?!

11:24.223 --> 11:25.657
...to stand up
for their sacrifice.

11:25.805 --> 11:27.890
This is the honor of our service.

11:28.030 --> 11:30.861
And every single one of them
believed in that.

11:30.992 --> 11:33.489
But they didn't believe
in <i>you</i> anymore, Sir!

11:33.753 --> 11:37.032
Don't you get that?
They didn't believe in <i>you!</i>

11:38.375 --> 11:40.336
They were scared and confused,

11:40.469 --> 11:42.067
and they wanted to go home!

11:42.181 --> 11:44.037
And all your speeches
and all your talk,

11:44.183 --> 11:46.116
that wasn't good enough anymore!

11:46.290 --> 11:48.374
Not for any of us!

11:50.538 --> 11:52.582
Captain, I'm gonna need you
to come with me.

12:00.052 --> 12:00.968
Where are you taking him?

12:01.093 --> 12:02.397
You know, you should
worry about yourself.

12:02.567 --> 12:05.441
You touch him...
I'll kill you.

12:05.556 --> 12:07.451
I hope you had a real nice talk

12:07.578 --> 12:09.776
with the old man there, XO,
because here's the thing...

12:12.588 --> 12:14.841
he ain't coming back.

12:29.047 --> 12:31.438
<i>...all of its officers.
Now, moments ago...</i>

12:31.566 --> 12:32.672
Robert?

12:32.784 --> 12:34.148
<i>Two senators...</i>

12:34.257 --> 12:36.906
<i>have confirmed that</i>
<i>the Speaker of the House</i>

12:37.022 --> 12:39.803
<i>is dead from an apparent suicide...</i>

12:39.909 --> 12:41.023
I wouldn't do that.

12:41.156 --> 12:42.574
<i>High-profile death tonight...</i>

12:42.683 --> 12:44.410
You're late.

12:45.697 --> 12:47.916
I thought you'd be
the next face on that screen.

12:49.966 --> 12:51.128
You're alive.
That's good.

12:51.237 --> 12:52.269
Robert, what happened?

12:55.749 --> 12:57.314
We didn't stand a chance.

12:59.261 --> 13:00.802
Lambs led to slaughter.

13:03.291 --> 13:05.807
Anderson and I went to the Times.

13:06.137 --> 13:08.045
There was this lady
in the elevator with us.

13:08.165 --> 13:09.986
Seemed like a nice lady, you know?

13:11.286 --> 13:12.401
She...

13:12.536 --> 13:15.089
she killed Anderson with a razor.

13:16.810 --> 13:18.946
Th-the doors opened,
and, uh,

13:19.298 --> 13:22.110
she put the knife in my hand
and she's gone.

13:22.210 --> 13:23.445
Okay, look,

13:23.750 --> 13:27.173
I still have resources.
I still have money.

13:27.330 --> 13:28.585
You look so good.

13:28.876 --> 13:30.765
Robert, are you listening to me?

13:33.060 --> 13:34.005
You should get that.

13:34.125 --> 13:36.399
Mine stopped working
the moment I got in here.

13:42.650 --> 13:43.753
Hello.

13:43.886 --> 13:46.355
Don't speak.
Listen to me, Kylie.

13:46.454 --> 13:48.120
You've put yourself in grave danger.

13:48.230 --> 13:50.709
Top drawer in the bedroom.
Go there now.

13:56.588 --> 13:57.408
Dad?

13:57.509 --> 14:00.099
Kylie, do you recognize my voice?

14:00.581 --> 14:01.421
Yes, Sir.

14:01.534 --> 14:03.687
Your father has assured me
that you can be trusted.

14:03.817 --> 14:05.848
Unfortunately,
your country needs proof.

14:06.034 --> 14:07.413
Do you understand?

14:07.541 --> 14:09.148
Yes, Mr. President.

14:16.624 --> 14:18.339
He wants you to kill me...

14:18.760 --> 14:21.464
the man who nuked Pakistan.

14:21.697 --> 14:24.274
Stop drinking.
Get your things.

14:24.377 --> 14:25.877
You don't have a choice.

14:26.156 --> 14:27.669
I'm not gonna do it.

14:27.798 --> 14:29.254
Here's what's gonna happen...

14:31.092 --> 14:33.187
They want some sick proof
of your loyalty?

14:33.356 --> 14:34.652
They're gonna get it.

14:35.260 --> 14:36.643
You're gonna shoot me.

14:36.883 --> 14:38.065
And then you're gonna go out there

14:38.186 --> 14:39.192
and you're gonna destroy

14:39.299 --> 14:41.257
every single person
who made this happen.

14:41.363 --> 14:42.896
And you're gonna do this for me.

14:43.133 --> 14:44.456
You're insane.

14:45.076 --> 14:46.852
Nothing would make me do that.

14:50.048 --> 14:51.580
Yes, you will.

14:54.575 --> 14:56.829
Tani, what happened?

14:57.104 --> 15:00.514
My brother discovered
prospectors on our land.

15:00.697 --> 15:02.739
When they wouldn't go,
he sent them running.

15:02.906 --> 15:04.639
They came back with guns.

15:04.745 --> 15:05.940
They beat my brother.

15:06.036 --> 15:07.198
Where are they?

15:07.869 --> 15:10.668
Do you still think
you owe me something, James?

15:10.962 --> 15:12.178
Yeah.

15:12.588 --> 15:14.294
Yeah, I do.

15:14.787 --> 15:17.799
The prospectors are working for Zheng.

15:18.654 --> 15:20.367
If he goes away,

15:20.485 --> 15:21.912
they go away.

15:22.032 --> 15:24.332
Oh, hell.

15:25.290 --> 15:26.807
Where are Lieutenant Shepard
and the COB?

15:26.918 --> 15:29.052
Locked in the torpedo
room, if you must know.

15:29.319 --> 15:30.152
Anders.

15:30.254 --> 15:32.708
Welcome to your mutiny, Sir.
So glad you could join us.

15:32.816 --> 15:33.834
Now please fasten your seat belt

15:33.967 --> 15:35.885
- and return your tray
to its stowed position... - Aah!

15:35.985 --> 15:38.564
- ...you son of a bitch.
- Ow!

15:40.184 --> 15:41.523
I told you I'd see you in hell.

15:42.736 --> 15:45.194
Hey, go get
that torpedo door open, huh?

15:45.327 --> 15:46.226
Wait a minute.

15:47.504 --> 15:48.671
Give me the keys.

15:57.205 --> 15:58.754
Sit down!

15:58.844 --> 16:00.758
Chief, Chinese on the line.

16:05.321 --> 16:07.068
This is the USS Colorado.

16:07.191 --> 16:08.067
We're headed to your position

16:08.182 --> 16:09.793
although we don't have your
exact coordinates right now.

16:09.916 --> 16:13.247
As you can see,
we've taken Chaplin prisoner.

16:13.345 --> 16:14.784
There are seven of us running the boat.

16:14.888 --> 16:16.007
The rest of the crew has disembarked

16:16.122 --> 16:18.978
prior to our getting underway.

16:19.067 --> 16:20.729
Is there anything
you'd like to add, Sir?

16:21.117 --> 16:22.665
The moment you touch this submarine,

16:22.793 --> 16:23.941
you've committed an act of war

16:24.044 --> 16:25.689
against the United States
of Am--

16:26.932 --> 16:28.095
If you give this boat to the Chinese,

16:28.201 --> 16:29.320
you start a war.

16:29.438 --> 16:31.105
You can sail the Colorado
to the blockade--

16:31.219 --> 16:33.804
Man, there is nothing else...

16:34.462 --> 16:36.117
for you,

16:36.230 --> 16:37.537
is there?

16:37.660 --> 16:39.652
Is that why you are so damn loyal

16:39.780 --> 16:43.407
to a country that hates you?

16:43.922 --> 16:45.248
I'm not like that, Sir.

16:45.335 --> 16:47.656
I still have a lot of living to do.

16:48.720 --> 16:50.440
Maybe not as much as you expect.

16:50.561 --> 16:51.715
You see?

16:51.827 --> 16:53.676
That's what I like about you, Captain.

16:53.798 --> 16:57.349
No matter how hard you try,
the thug always shows through.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.729
Which one of you knows
how to operate this station?

17:24.156 --> 17:25.239
I can.

17:25.358 --> 17:26.281
Ah.

17:26.406 --> 17:27.661
I mean, I know the basics.

17:27.757 --> 17:29.727
You. Good.

17:29.830 --> 17:31.111
Make it work.

17:49.671 --> 17:50.478
Aah.

17:50.596 --> 17:51.960
I think we got it, COB.

17:52.099 --> 17:52.818
You hang in there,

17:52.937 --> 17:54.649
and drinks are on me
once we get topside.

17:54.917 --> 17:56.455
I'm on the wagon, remember?

17:56.573 --> 17:57.983
Right, sorry.

17:58.824 --> 18:00.219
Screw it.

18:00.523 --> 18:01.938
It's a date.

18:02.428 --> 18:05.129
Just make it something brown
from Tennessee.

18:06.018 --> 18:08.439
We can just pour it through the hole.

18:16.963 --> 18:19.423
Perseus coming online.
Stand by.

18:21.189 --> 18:22.383
They're gonna kill him, aren't they?

18:22.473 --> 18:23.838
No, that's not the plan.

18:23.935 --> 18:25.445
Come on, Kowalski.
There is no plan.

18:25.565 --> 18:26.960
You trust Hawkes
to come up with a plan?

18:27.068 --> 18:28.241
Hey, shut up!

18:28.466 --> 18:31.026
What is it?

18:31.171 --> 18:33.333
Zheng promised you all
a good deal, is that it?

18:33.457 --> 18:35.471
Even you, Kowalski?

18:35.612 --> 18:36.860
Which you personally confirmed, right?

18:36.982 --> 18:38.385
I mean, you would have to be
a first-class moron not to--

18:38.494 --> 18:41.574
You <i>really</i> want to shut up now.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.180
Ugh!

18:55.649 --> 18:57.535
Chief, we're losing reactor power.

18:57.789 --> 18:59.147
Perseus is going offline.

18:59.286 --> 19:00.507
Mess to conn.

19:00.646 --> 19:02.346
The XO kinda got away.

19:02.457 --> 19:04.458
Kowalski, he's in engineering.

19:04.654 --> 19:06.140
Brannan, keep things moving.

19:06.257 --> 19:07.288
We'll have power back up in a second.

19:07.404 --> 19:08.642
Wallace, let's go.

19:09.616 --> 19:11.650
Lawrence, come here.

19:12.958 --> 19:14.772
All right, I need you
to shut off all unnecessary...

19:21.180 --> 19:23.057
Lawrence?
Lawrence, what's going on up there?

19:23.163 --> 19:24.248
Go, go, go, go.

19:28.054 --> 19:28.986
Lawrence is down!

19:29.092 --> 19:30.966
The captain's escaped!
Where the hell is Brannan?

19:31.065 --> 19:33.288
Kowalski, check level
one. Wallace, you're with me.

19:41.284 --> 19:43.170
Captain, I can
hold 'em off. Find the XO.

19:43.296 --> 19:45.023
- I'm right behind you.
- Thank you, Brannan.

19:48.817 --> 19:49.681
Hey, Wallace!

19:49.786 --> 19:51.050
Why don't you tell 'em
why you cried like a baby

19:51.162 --> 19:52.428
all through boot camp?

19:52.548 --> 19:54.214
Go, Sir. Go!

19:55.788 --> 19:58.301
Because your girl was shacking
with your sister, huh?

19:58.413 --> 19:59.308
True story.

19:59.418 --> 20:00.318
Captain, get down!

20:08.180 --> 20:10.648
Oh, no. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

20:11.495 --> 20:12.590
Josh...

20:13.166 --> 20:14.594
why'd you do that?

20:16.454 --> 20:18.918
If you have to ask...

20:25.407 --> 20:27.396
He's dead, Captain!

20:29.269 --> 20:30.750
How many more?

20:31.903 --> 20:33.857
How many more?!

20:40.825 --> 20:42.218
Sam.

20:48.052 --> 20:50.038
Prosser's broken ranks with the mutiny.

20:50.565 --> 20:53.303
He and Grace are barricaded
in the torpedo room.

20:53.591 --> 20:55.504
Anders is
running the show up there now.

20:55.652 --> 20:57.400
I scram'd the reactor,
got the Perseus offline.

20:57.523 --> 20:58.701
I think I can get control of the planes

20:58.814 --> 21:00.118
and the helm from here.

21:00.635 --> 21:01.892
How'd you get free?

21:02.973 --> 21:04.504
Brannan.

21:05.098 --> 21:06.508
He was your spy?

21:06.621 --> 21:07.469
Yeah.

21:07.566 --> 21:08.963
Anders shot him in the back.

21:11.398 --> 21:12.389
Communications?

21:12.528 --> 21:13.632
We can hear pretty much everything.

21:13.765 --> 21:15.574
Nothing long range
with the antenna rolled in.

21:15.683 --> 21:17.832
Can probably blast out to the EWS.

21:17.949 --> 21:19.530
They'll take the Colorado apart.

21:20.250 --> 21:21.459
Not in any visible way,

21:21.581 --> 21:22.821
but they'll learn her inside and out

21:22.940 --> 21:24.136
before they hand her back.

21:24.237 --> 21:26.179
I'll scuttle her
before I let that happen.

21:26.673 --> 21:29.590
This can't end with
the Colorado in enemy hands.

21:30.699 --> 21:32.791
What, you think I need convincing?

21:37.071 --> 21:39.290
This is the
Colorado XO to anyone at the EWS.

21:39.421 --> 21:41.248
Please come in.

21:42.606 --> 21:44.695
This is the Colorado XO
to anyone at the EWS.

21:44.812 --> 21:45.745
Please come in.

21:45.868 --> 21:47.435
S-Sam, it's Sophie.
I can hear you.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.426
Sophie, we've lost control
of the Colorado.

21:53.551 --> 21:55.747
Mutineers are driving the boat
out to meet the Chinese fleet.

21:55.857 --> 21:57.606
Yeah, I know. Zheng has
taken control here.

21:57.747 --> 21:59.321
Can you call Washington?

21:59.435 --> 22:00.350
I'm not sure.

22:00.548 --> 22:01.989
Yes, perhaps.

22:02.110 --> 22:03.696
Okay, I need you to tell them
what's happening.

22:03.903 --> 22:06.275
Tell them we can give them
a target if they can hit it.

22:06.394 --> 22:08.194
I need them to strike
the Colorado, Sophie.

22:08.300 --> 22:09.165
What?

22:09.311 --> 22:10.595
Y-you don't have to
do this.

22:10.718 --> 22:12.577
How will you get off the boat?

22:12.670 --> 22:13.497
Sam?

22:13.616 --> 22:15.257
I know this is unfair of me to ask,

22:15.679 --> 22:17.217
but this is what I want.

22:17.740 --> 22:19.426
And this is what needs to happen.

22:21.192 --> 22:23.326
Do you remember the last time
we talked like this?

22:24.182 --> 22:26.386
Only this time, I am not lost.

22:26.491 --> 22:28.908
I know where I need to go,
but I cannot get there alone.

22:29.420 --> 22:30.969
The rest will have to wait.

22:31.085 --> 22:32.110
Okay?

22:32.386 --> 22:33.717
Okay.

22:34.330 --> 22:35.813
Okay.

22:37.093 --> 22:38.897
Ohh.

22:55.735 --> 22:57.335
_

23:05.460 --> 23:07.084
Ohh.

23:08.765 --> 23:10.192
The captain and the XO
are in engineering.

23:10.295 --> 23:12.308
Kowalski's dead.
Why are we speeding up?

23:12.435 --> 23:13.400
We lost vertical control.

23:13.514 --> 23:14.207
Well, get it back.

23:14.314 --> 23:15.531
Chief, we're receiving incoming EHF

23:15.645 --> 23:16.762
from EWS Sainte Marina.

23:16.861 --> 23:18.167
Lawrence, what the hell
did you do to this thing?

23:18.303 --> 23:19.594
I didn't do anything, man.
It's jammed.

23:19.706 --> 23:21.187
You guys, shut up!

23:23.028 --> 23:24.970
Captain Hal Anders.

23:25.194 --> 23:26.669
Colorado, this is Sainte Marina.

23:26.777 --> 23:28.546
US air command confirms strike.

23:28.664 --> 23:30.494
Tracking your signature now.

23:30.597 --> 23:31.805
Return control of the Colorado

23:31.908 --> 23:34.152
to Marcus Chaplin
or you will be destroyed.

23:34.252 --> 23:34.914
What?

23:35.006 --> 23:36.722
No, no. No, no, no.
They-- they're too late.

23:36.897 --> 23:38.301
No, we get command of the boat,

23:38.426 --> 23:39.265
and we'll beat 'em there.

23:39.356 --> 23:41.502
There's no way they touch us
once we're with the Chinese.

23:43.086 --> 23:44.251
What is that?

23:45.862 --> 23:48.109
Two American F/A-18
attack aircraft.

23:48.210 --> 23:49.868
How? How did they know?

23:50.476 --> 23:51.557
Sophie!

23:52.432 --> 23:54.540
Your captain and your friends
are on that ship.

23:54.960 --> 23:56.076
Help me speak with them.

23:56.198 --> 23:57.535
I can get my people to protect them.

23:57.664 --> 23:59.800
Otherwise, they <i>will</i> die.

24:01.805 --> 24:03.156
I know.

24:04.060 --> 24:05.417
Sorry.

24:16.294 --> 24:18.083
You're kinda gettin' a Little
handsy there, Lieutenant.

24:18.202 --> 24:20.362
Yeah. I missed
the sensitivity training.

24:21.476 --> 24:22.691
That dimwit should know better

24:22.802 --> 24:24.670
than using an arc welder
while we're underway.

24:24.809 --> 24:27.780
Like the USS Bonefish, electrical fire.

24:27.897 --> 24:30.661
The CO, the OOD,
the helmsman, the radioman--

24:30.914 --> 24:33.901
they were all below deck.
All four of 'em died.

24:34.019 --> 24:34.906
From the fire?

24:35.012 --> 24:37.334
Otto fuel from the torpedoes.

24:37.758 --> 24:39.109
You see, when it burns,

24:39.425 --> 24:41.753
you get yourself cyanide gas.

24:46.106 --> 24:49.141
Attention,
my dearest ex-bosses.

24:49.399 --> 24:51.263
Stop messing with the submarine,

24:51.393 --> 24:53.292
or so help me, you're both be dead.

24:54.633 --> 24:56.984
Copy that, conn.
So are you.

24:58.485 --> 24:59.616
He's trying to get under it.

24:59.706 --> 25:01.389
He can't, not with a belly full of air.

25:01.488 --> 25:02.894
We got helm disabled.

25:07.701 --> 25:10.054
On my second tour on Hamlin's boat,

25:10.236 --> 25:11.372
the Nevada,

25:11.500 --> 25:12.268
I touched the wrong lead,

25:12.386 --> 25:14.544
and I got 10,000 volts
through the chest.

25:15.389 --> 25:19.167
My heart stopped beating
for 65 seconds.

25:20.434 --> 25:22.126
You never told me that.

25:22.241 --> 25:25.186
And I saw myself
in the corridor of a hospital.

25:25.722 --> 25:28.084
Right outside the room
where Jeffrey was born.

25:28.761 --> 25:30.593
And Angela's inside,
and she's screaming and crying,

25:30.705 --> 25:32.061
and I go to help her.

25:32.576 --> 25:34.897
And instead,
I'm walking on to the conn.

25:35.204 --> 25:36.665
It's my boat now.

25:37.321 --> 25:38.710
I'm captain.

25:38.828 --> 25:40.698
And just outside...

25:41.090 --> 25:43.368
I can hear all the things
that I'm missing.

25:43.655 --> 25:45.350
I hear Jeffrey's graduation,

25:45.473 --> 25:47.472
and Angela laughing with the boys...

25:47.651 --> 25:51.010
my family going on without me.

25:52.306 --> 25:54.513
And I keep waiting to feel regret.

25:55.474 --> 25:57.947
I keep waiting for some realization

25:58.062 --> 26:00.677
of all the terrible,
selfish choices I've made.

26:01.074 --> 26:03.794
But it never comes.

26:04.008 --> 26:07.579
Death is--
is more forgiving.

26:07.767 --> 26:09.518
I'm on the conn of my boat,

26:09.632 --> 26:11.844
heading out into stormy seas,

26:12.432 --> 26:14.730
and I'm at peace.

26:24.944 --> 26:26.855
Yeah, laugh it up, XO.

26:29.314 --> 26:31.927
No, I envy you, Marcus.
I really do.

26:32.641 --> 26:35.003
Even at the end, you're right
where you want to be,

26:35.509 --> 26:36.793
aren't you?

26:40.906 --> 26:42.546
What's it for you, XO?

26:42.657 --> 26:44.018
What do you want?

26:46.523 --> 26:48.290
I want revenge.

26:50.403 --> 26:52.110
I don't need Krishna,
I don't need Buddha,

26:52.216 --> 26:53.684
not even Jesus to show me my path.

26:53.784 --> 26:55.075
Mine is clear.

26:55.177 --> 26:56.761
I find the ones who made this happen.

26:56.896 --> 26:58.646
I balance the scales.

27:02.484 --> 27:04.255
That's pretty dark, XO.

27:04.371 --> 27:06.488
Remind me to recommend you
for a psych eval.

27:06.605 --> 27:09.005
A psych eval?

27:09.130 --> 27:10.447
Me?

27:11.394 --> 27:12.965
Well, forgive me,
but you fired a nuke, no?

27:13.063 --> 27:14.336
Well, it was a strategic move.

27:14.446 --> 27:16.626
A strategic move? Okay.

27:16.773 --> 27:18.770
Really? Is that what it was?
Let me get this straight.

27:18.928 --> 27:20.478
Uh, you fired a nuke as a warning,

27:20.670 --> 27:22.541
but I'm the one that needs
my head examined?

27:22.628 --> 27:24.247
- Is that it?
- That's right.

27:26.465 --> 27:27.949
Hey, uh, Anders.

27:28.796 --> 27:30.731
Anders, you still up there?

27:30.842 --> 27:32.404
You know in another minute
I'm gonna have control,

27:32.529 --> 27:34.142
and then I'm gonna dive
the boat, and then I'm gonna--

27:34.243 --> 27:35.588
I know, I know.
You're gonna kill us all.

27:35.703 --> 27:36.783
Very scary stuff. Listen.

27:36.910 --> 27:38.467
Since you're a
world-class psychopath,

27:38.590 --> 27:39.966
I want you to decide something for us.

27:40.113 --> 27:41.556
Who's crazier, me or the captain?

27:41.676 --> 27:43.822
Shut up. Shut up!

27:43.930 --> 27:45.571
Oh, Anders, don't be like that.

27:45.690 --> 27:46.526
Come on. I'm asking you,

27:46.628 --> 27:48.274
who's the biggest nut job on
the boat, me or the captain?

27:48.381 --> 27:49.660
Shut up!

28:03.612 --> 28:06.187
Open up the hatches and spin up
missiles five through eight.

28:06.316 --> 28:07.673
Target?

28:11.623 --> 28:15.057
Hey, Chaplin,
I have both keys--

28:16.433 --> 28:17.799
little trick I learned--

28:17.904 --> 28:19.169
and I'm gonna fire a missile
to your hometown

28:19.261 --> 28:20.663
of Dundalk, Maryland.

28:20.753 --> 28:23.124
Maybe that'll back off
those attack aircraft.

28:24.542 --> 28:25.536
Damn it.

28:25.638 --> 28:27.608
At least they had
the decency to fill the bar.

28:28.173 --> 28:29.159
You know what?

28:29.256 --> 28:31.529
I am sick of your fatalistic crap.

28:31.648 --> 28:34.692
When did you ever give up?
We are gonna get out of here.

28:34.837 --> 28:36.064
Okay?

28:36.177 --> 28:37.584
We're gonna get out of here together.

28:40.507 --> 28:43.039
So take it, and we will
walk out of here

28:43.217 --> 28:44.982
with me as your hostage, okay?

28:45.103 --> 28:46.663
Go. Do it.

28:46.763 --> 28:48.339
No offense, but if I-I thought
it would work,

28:48.448 --> 28:49.860
I wouldn't hesitate.

28:49.972 --> 28:51.627
But you're not worth anything to them.

28:51.790 --> 28:53.641
Not until you prove you are.

28:55.267 --> 28:57.554
There's still a way for us
to bring the fight to them.

28:57.817 --> 28:59.062
One way.

28:59.204 --> 29:00.560
I told you, I'm not gonna do it.

29:00.695 --> 29:03.423
You can be the one to
bring it all crumbling down.

29:03.619 --> 29:05.229
I can't do it alone.

29:05.534 --> 29:06.830
- You have to.
- I can't.

29:06.959 --> 29:08.279
You have to.

29:12.512 --> 29:14.325
Make them all pay, Kylie.

29:14.822 --> 29:16.431
Make them all pay.

29:17.382 --> 29:18.965
Mm.

29:39.785 --> 29:40.978
That's the missile doors opening.

29:41.091 --> 29:42.905
Another minute,
they'll be cleared to fire.

29:43.249 --> 29:44.667
Well, we still have rudder control.

29:45.099 --> 29:46.726
Do you know where we are?

29:46.833 --> 29:48.156
I've been tracking our course changes.

29:48.274 --> 29:49.594
In one minute, hard to starboard,

29:49.739 --> 29:51.349
we hit the outer shoals.

30:08.958 --> 30:10.764
I think the COB's dead.

30:42.449 --> 30:43.848
They got us in a hard turn.

30:43.970 --> 30:45.165
Coming about to starboard.

30:45.268 --> 30:46.137
Put me on an open channel.

30:46.259 --> 30:47.704
I want the whole world to hear this.

30:52.439 --> 30:53.764
To who it may concern,

30:53.890 --> 30:55.212
this is the USS Colorado.

30:55.329 --> 30:57.084
We see your
attack aircraft approaching.

30:57.210 --> 30:58.595
I'm 30 seconds away

30:58.722 --> 31:00.884
from improving the state of Maryland

31:01.023 --> 31:03.167
so back the hell off!

31:03.680 --> 31:05.816
You hear me?

31:09.576 --> 31:10.874
Wallace.

31:13.151 --> 31:14.621
Man your key.

31:16.353 --> 31:17.580
Hal...

31:19.835 --> 31:21.101
Now.

31:37.252 --> 31:39.044
Mark.

31:50.517 --> 31:51.941
Was it worth it?

32:14.749 --> 32:16.886
_

32:28.165 --> 32:30.078
Mr. Zheng,
we had a deal.

32:30.230 --> 32:31.844
Yes, and so much good

32:31.967 --> 32:33.714
that will do either of us now.

32:34.551 --> 32:36.546
I promised my masters a submarine.

32:37.066 --> 32:40.184
And now I shall return in disgrace.

32:46.988 --> 32:49.016
I could have given you everything...

32:50.289 --> 32:52.633
yet you choose a dead man.

32:52.763 --> 32:54.226
It breaks my heart.

32:54.622 --> 32:56.242
Mine, too.

33:19.763 --> 33:21.317
Come on, Sailor.

33:22.004 --> 33:23.574
Just one more.

33:38.131 --> 33:40.652
I don't want you to be
a killer anymore.

33:40.753 --> 33:42.283
Not for me.

33:43.058 --> 33:44.829
Not for anyone.

34:13.174 --> 34:14.601
Chaplin.

34:26.281 --> 34:28.009
We've got to go.

34:28.353 --> 34:29.527
We gotta go.

34:30.237 --> 34:31.284
Come on.

34:39.636 --> 34:40.639
The Chinese are still converging.

34:40.748 --> 34:41.589
Our guys are gonna get here first.

34:41.690 --> 34:43.462
We got maybe 15 minutes.

34:43.958 --> 34:44.996
Hull's compromised.

34:45.100 --> 34:47.239
Even if we get off this shoal,
we're not going anywhere, Sir.

34:47.360 --> 34:49.447
Captain, XO,
we're ready at the main hatch.

34:50.607 --> 34:52.009
We'll be right there.

34:53.284 --> 34:56.042
Okay.
We gotta go, Sir.

34:56.167 --> 34:58.292
I can still dry fire a Mark 48

34:58.422 --> 34:59.349
and blow the sub.

34:59.450 --> 35:00.413
No, no. No, we-- we--

35:00.506 --> 35:02.366
we have two bombers that
are gonna take care of that.

35:02.480 --> 35:03.702
You don't know that.

35:03.811 --> 35:06.728
Someone strikes a deal,
and... things change.

35:07.152 --> 35:08.030
Excuse me?

35:08.138 --> 35:10.950
I'm not leaving her empty, Sam.

35:11.604 --> 35:12.410
What are you talking about?

35:12.522 --> 35:13.417
Sir, we have to get out of here.

35:13.521 --> 35:15.129
We have to leave right now.

35:20.651 --> 35:21.577
All right, you want to do this?

35:21.697 --> 35:22.756
Let's do this.

35:22.845 --> 35:24.131
No, this is my house.

35:24.241 --> 35:25.068
Well, it's my house, too, damn it.

35:25.178 --> 35:27.111
This is not a decision you get
to make on your own, Marcus.

35:27.220 --> 35:29.524
It's not the same for me
as it is for you, Sam,

35:30.349 --> 35:31.743
'cause I'm home.

35:32.127 --> 35:33.499
Do you see?

35:33.674 --> 35:35.665
Right here, I'm home. Hmm?

35:35.764 --> 35:37.369
Those sailors that died,

35:37.590 --> 35:39.091
they're my family.

35:39.197 --> 35:41.766
But for you, life is still out there.

35:41.866 --> 35:44.479
Oh... what the hell
is out there for me?

35:44.589 --> 35:45.848
You tell me. What the hell
is out there for me?

35:45.954 --> 35:47.175
You said it yourself.

35:47.281 --> 35:49.133
You need revenge.

35:49.247 --> 35:51.318
But that's not what this is.

35:51.451 --> 35:53.440
You're not done fighting, Sam, but...

35:54.274 --> 35:56.034
I'm all out of moves.

35:56.595 --> 35:58.025
So...

35:58.151 --> 36:01.151
I'm asking you as my friend...

36:02.107 --> 36:04.073
I can't do this

36:04.785 --> 36:06.405
with you here.

36:12.364 --> 36:15.449
You know I signed up 'cause I
didn't know what else to do.

36:17.052 --> 36:18.616
You know that.

36:19.028 --> 36:20.184
I was just looking for something.

36:20.283 --> 36:22.349
I was looking for something,
I was looking for anything...

36:22.911 --> 36:24.402
anything to believe in.

36:25.623 --> 36:27.830
I didn't know what to fight for.

36:28.499 --> 36:30.102
But I do now.

36:30.702 --> 36:32.757
They will know what we did.

36:33.618 --> 36:35.848
They will know why we did it.

36:37.113 --> 36:38.972
No regrets.

36:40.354 --> 36:42.186
None.

36:44.118 --> 36:46.181
It's been an honor, Sir.

37:04.311 --> 37:05.285
<i>My-- my captain</i>
<i>was a man</i>

37:05.388 --> 37:06.886
<i>who-- who liked a good fight.</i>

37:07.439 --> 37:09.146
Maybe too much so.

37:09.644 --> 37:12.557
'Cause, uh, what he started,
it-- it changed everything.

37:20.505 --> 37:22.471
Thank you.

37:23.060 --> 37:24.579
Safe travels, Sailor.

37:26.894 --> 37:28.611
Okay. Come on.

37:29.409 --> 37:31.096
What's going on, Kylie?

37:31.958 --> 37:34.122
I need you to do something for me.

37:34.238 --> 37:35.504
Okay.

37:36.169 --> 37:38.380
Give this to the reporters.

37:38.513 --> 37:40.118
Tell them everything you know,

37:40.231 --> 37:42.780
and what's on this drive
will do the rest.

37:42.898 --> 37:44.336
What reporters?

37:44.663 --> 37:46.465
Those reporters.

37:49.424 --> 37:51.372
But what are you g--

37:54.070 --> 37:56.033
<i>He was a man who inspired others to act</i>

37:56.160 --> 37:58.265
<i>through action, through instinct.</i>

37:58.551 --> 38:00.948
He made me better than
what I knew I could be.

38:01.064 --> 38:02.553
He made me stronger.

38:04.072 --> 38:05.352
Christine, Christine, Christine,

38:05.510 --> 38:07.535
Ms. Sinclair indicated
you had information for us

38:07.647 --> 38:09.179
about the Colorado.

38:10.967 --> 38:12.388
I do.

38:13.598 --> 38:15.632
I have a story to tell you.

38:15.742 --> 38:17.624
I'll just say that he-- he
didn't want to be a hero,

38:17.753 --> 38:18.552
that's for sure.

38:18.663 --> 38:19.925
I mean, and certainly not
a revolutionary.

38:20.043 --> 38:22.656
That's just... that's not who he was.

38:28.043 --> 38:30.333
No, that won't be necessary, fellas.

38:30.812 --> 38:32.299
She's one of us.

38:32.389 --> 38:33.580
Dad.

38:34.175 --> 38:34.853
Mm.

38:34.942 --> 38:38.796
We have a very special guest
visiting us this evening.

38:39.890 --> 38:41.749
<i>But he had the guts to say no.</i>

38:41.865 --> 38:43.872
He said no, and the world changed,

38:44.036 --> 38:45.601
a president fell.

38:50.120 --> 38:51.850
Mr. President.

38:58.305 --> 39:00.167
But you're asking for who he was,

39:00.277 --> 39:02.257
<i>and I'm not sure</i>
<i>I-I-I can tell you that.</i>

39:02.358 --> 39:05.158
<i>I'm not sure anyone could really.</i>

39:26.906 --> 39:28.284
<i>Was he crazy?</i>

39:28.915 --> 39:30.573
<i>Yeah, maybe he was crazy.</i>

39:32.024 --> 39:34.035
<i>Maybe just crazy enough.</i>

39:42.057 --> 39:43.175
<i>There's gonna be investigations.</i>

39:43.296 --> 39:44.533
<i>There's gonna be hearings.</i>

39:44.650 --> 39:46.548
<i>Someone's gonna decide</i>
<i>what really happened,</i>

39:46.661 --> 39:48.836
<i>but we didn't go to</i>
<i>Sainte Marina to prove a point.</i>

39:50.182 --> 39:52.215
<i>We were just trying to survive.</i>

39:54.455 --> 39:56.313
<i>But survive right...</i>

39:56.985 --> 39:58.431
<i>in our hearts.</i>

40:00.206 --> 40:04.055
<i>Marcus would have a speech here</i>
<i>about what's worth defending.</i>

40:08.879 --> 40:10.998
<i>I'll just say, we were</i>
<i>fighting to get home.</i>

40:17.487 --> 40:20.194
<i>Mom, apple pie-- if that's</i>
<i>what it is to you, fine.</i>

40:20.318 --> 40:21.835
<i>Not me.</i>

40:22.032 --> 40:23.588
Maybe it's a woman.

40:24.052 --> 40:25.989
Someplace you know you belong.

40:26.958 --> 40:27.960
<i>Maybe you don't know what it is</i>

40:28.071 --> 40:29.635
<i>until it's taken from you.</i>

40:43.674 --> 40:45.643
But we're back now.
We're home.

40:45.964 --> 40:47.977
And I can't speak for the rest of 'em,

40:48.979 --> 40:50.514
but I'm staying.
Excuse me.

40:50.619 --> 40:51.755
Wait.
I have another question.

40:52.324 --> 40:54.824
Wait. Wait. Wait.
