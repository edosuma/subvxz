04:03.643 --> 04:06.043
<i>Delta Team, he's 50 meters away.</i>

04:06.279 --> 04:07.974
<i>Can you see him?</i>

04:08.514 --> 04:10.175
<i>Copy that.</i>

04:11.718 --> 04:13.481
<i>He's headed your way.</i>

04:14.954 --> 04:18.219
<i>He's on the move</i>
<i>so let's be on standby.</i>

04:21.961 --> 04:24.361
All right, let's roll.

05:46.646 --> 05:49.012
Hold your fire!

05:56.689 --> 06:01.592
Everybody hold back out there.
Let him run. He ain't going anywhere.

06:43.503 --> 06:44.993
Back away!

06:45.204 --> 06:48.071
Get it out of here! Go on, get it out!

06:53.780 --> 06:56.772
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
Put that gun down.

06:57.049 --> 06:58.949
Put it down.

06:59.152 --> 07:01.120
Don't make me.

08:30.743 --> 08:35.544
lt's inappropriate for a murderer
to come to his victim's burial.

08:35.748 --> 08:38.477
Just here to pay my respects.

08:39.217 --> 08:40.981
Respect?

08:41.687 --> 08:46.124
For the blood of my child?
My orphaned grandson?

08:47.627 --> 08:49.891
Your son made his choice.

08:50.429 --> 08:53.489
And you made your choice,
detective.

08:54.233 --> 08:57.896
The day you chose to pursue
a vendetta against me.

09:00.239 --> 09:02.434
Against my family.

09:04.844 --> 09:10.214
Your position offers more opportunity
for arrogance than safety.

11:19.645 --> 11:22.011
My son is dead.

11:23.349 --> 11:25.317
My condolences.

11:38.664 --> 11:41.565
A child is irreplaceable.

11:45.104 --> 11:47.868
Which brings us to your task.

11:52.511 --> 11:54.502
lt involves a cop.

11:55.347 --> 11:58.043
That's why we want an outsider.

12:01.687 --> 12:05.555
After that,
your obligation to me ends.

14:49.421 --> 14:51.412
Dad, come on.

16:21.113 --> 16:22.478
John...

16:24.116 --> 16:27.347
...we are talking about Terence Wei.

16:33.258 --> 16:36.455
Safe has a very limited meaning.

17:10.329 --> 17:12.455
There's been a problem.

17:22.641 --> 17:27.203
Why ain't this car done?
l gotta get it on the boat tomorrow.

17:27.378 --> 17:30.906
Nobody leaves until
this car is done, you hear me?

17:31.083 --> 17:35.713
And get rid of the VlN numbers. l
don't wanna get caught for that again.

17:38.791 --> 17:41.282
All right, you guys, get back to work.
lt's for me.

17:41.460 --> 17:44.623
How the hell do you guys get phones?
l don't pay you enough for that.

17:44.797 --> 17:45.786
What do you want?

17:46.365 --> 17:47.992
Eddie, it's John.

17:48.200 --> 17:51.260
What happened?
The piece wasn't there?

17:51.470 --> 17:53.267
lt was there.

17:54.006 --> 17:56.372
l need a passport, can you help?

17:56.608 --> 17:58.838
Yeah, l'll just call Bob.

17:59.078 --> 18:02.707
No, he works for Mr. Wei.

18:02.948 --> 18:05.974
Everybody works for Wei.
What do you want?

18:06.185 --> 18:08.153
<i>l want someone who doesn't.</i>

18:11.623 --> 18:13.887
l know this broad.

18:14.326 --> 18:18.524
l don't use her much because
she's a pain in the ass.

18:18.797 --> 18:20.992
-Her name's Meg Coburn.
-Coburn?

18:21.233 --> 18:23.895
<i>She's in the Olive Building.</i>

18:24.136 --> 18:28.903
-Where you gonna be in the morning?
-lt's best if you don't know.

18:29.908 --> 18:33.309
All right, Johnny.
Watch your back, huh?

19:25.430 --> 19:26.692
Yeah?

19:27.266 --> 19:28.961
Meg Coburn?

19:29.201 --> 19:31.260
Never heard of her.

19:35.107 --> 19:36.699
Eddie.

19:36.909 --> 19:38.467
Eddie sent me.

19:39.578 --> 19:41.068
Great.

19:42.614 --> 19:44.241
Hang on a second.

20:13.946 --> 20:15.914
All right, come on in.

20:26.959 --> 20:28.824
Can l help you?

20:29.528 --> 20:31.519
l need a package.

20:31.763 --> 20:35.426
-What's a package?
-Papers, you know?

20:35.634 --> 20:40.333
l don't know. l'm slow that way.
You'll need to be specific.

20:47.346 --> 20:52.283
l want forged documents to China.

20:53.318 --> 20:56.185
Okay. You said ''forged.''

20:56.888 --> 20:58.253
We'll do it.

20:58.457 --> 21:00.516
Now have a seat.

21:05.364 --> 21:06.956
Or not.

21:07.165 --> 21:09.065
-l don't have much time.
-As you will.

21:09.334 --> 21:11.063
China? Mainland?

21:11.703 --> 21:15.434
All right. You're gonna need a visa,
a birth certificate, a driver's license...

21:15.607 --> 21:18.201
...and a passport.
To make coming and going easier...

21:18.377 --> 21:20.174
...we make you an American citizen.

21:20.379 --> 21:22.074
What you need is gonna cost you.

21:23.649 --> 21:24.809
No problem.

21:25.817 --> 21:28.581
The only way money isn't a problem
is if l see it upfront.

21:28.754 --> 21:32.451
Because l don't like hassling with
assholes, you know what l'm saying?

21:48.140 --> 21:50.904
How soon did you say
you needed this?

21:52.044 --> 21:56.003
From here l go to the airport.
One hour.

21:56.214 --> 21:57.909
That soon?

21:59.785 --> 22:01.719
All right, back up.

22:05.991 --> 22:10.553
You have to back up
because l'm taking your picture.

22:12.864 --> 22:17.358
Smile and say,
''Flight from prosecution.''

22:26.178 --> 22:27.543
What's your name?

22:28.980 --> 22:30.709
John.

22:32.050 --> 22:33.984
And?

22:34.186 --> 22:35.517
John Lee.

22:36.088 --> 22:37.953
Thank you.

22:39.858 --> 22:44.591
You sure? Aren't there like a billion
John Lees in China?

22:46.164 --> 22:50.396
Yeah, all right. John Lee it is.

22:57.242 --> 22:59.210
l can fix that.

23:05.717 --> 23:07.241
Yeah?

23:09.254 --> 23:11.245
Meg Coburn?

23:14.526 --> 23:16.721
Never heard of her.

25:01.299 --> 25:02.664
This way!

25:58.423 --> 26:00.857
All right, hold it right there!

26:42.968 --> 26:45.266
He's still out there.

26:46.237 --> 26:47.761
He won't get to China.

26:47.973 --> 26:51.841
We shouldn't be chasing
our problems, Mr. Kogan.

26:52.110 --> 26:54.101
We should be solving them.

27:00.719 --> 27:03.483
How would you like this handled?

27:04.155 --> 27:06.521
Bring in professionals.

27:10.462 --> 27:12.828
Men of John's talent.

27:25.910 --> 27:28.105
-Coffee, no sugar okay?
-Nope, no sugar.

27:28.279 --> 27:29.712
A ham sandwich would be better.

27:29.881 --> 27:32.907
l mean, l've been sitting here
for 1 2 fucking hours.

27:33.318 --> 27:35.843
All right. Let's see...

27:36.021 --> 27:39.354
...what Meg Coburn's all about,
shall we?

27:39.958 --> 27:44.156
Swindle, bad checks, mail fraud,
no heavy felonies here.

27:44.896 --> 27:49.924
But you make up for that in volume:
1 2 arrests before you were 1 6.

27:50.535 --> 27:54.437
lt's odd for a girl that age
to be in so much trouble.

27:54.673 --> 27:57.938
l've always considered myself
a feminist pioneer.

28:00.178 --> 28:04.342
You've been clean here
for about four and a half years.

28:04.549 --> 28:07.848
You either got smart
or you've been...

28:08.119 --> 28:10.485
-...lucky.
-ls there a third choice?

28:10.655 --> 28:15.490
lt doesn't matter.
Your good luck ran out today.

28:15.660 --> 28:20.859
Now let's talk about your office
and four dead bodies.

28:23.034 --> 28:25.696
l'll bite. Where did they come from?

28:27.572 --> 28:29.199
You didn't kill them, did you?

28:29.407 --> 28:33.138
You think a lightweight
like me did all that?

28:34.512 --> 28:37.504
-Who's that?
-lt looks like a ghost.

28:38.249 --> 28:41.741
Come on, Meg, you can
do better than that.

28:42.020 --> 28:44.147
lt was in your computer.

28:45.056 --> 28:48.219
You're a bright girl in a bad place.

28:49.427 --> 28:52.055
-l can help you.
-Yeah.

28:52.330 --> 28:56.357
l can't seem to remember
one single bad place...

28:56.634 --> 28:58.329
...a cop helped me out of.

28:58.536 --> 29:01.027
ls that so? Well...

29:02.507 --> 29:06.773
...somebody helped when
you were 1 4. Custodial placement.

29:07.011 --> 29:08.876
But you don't remember that.

29:09.481 --> 29:10.778
Fuck you.

29:10.949 --> 29:14.680
-You know nothing about me.
-l know everything.

29:14.853 --> 29:18.186
lt's all here in black and white.
Read it.

29:20.558 --> 29:24.016
lt's your life,
nobody screwed it up but yourself.

29:25.130 --> 29:28.327
-You're looking at two years.
-Minimum.

29:29.000 --> 29:34.097
lf you really were smart, you wouldn't
mess around with Terence Wei.

29:34.973 --> 29:38.272
-Terence Wei?
-That's right, Terence Wei.

29:38.476 --> 29:42.537
Where do you think those
dead bodies in your office came from?

29:42.714 --> 29:45.080
l have never dealt with
Terence Wei in my life.

29:45.450 --> 29:47.315
Well, you have now, okay?

29:49.687 --> 29:53.418
Okay, this is the part
where l talk to an attorney.

29:54.225 --> 29:56.250
You're not under arrest.

29:56.494 --> 29:59.258
You have no right to an attorney.

29:59.531 --> 30:02.898
lt also means
l can walk out the fucking door.

30:03.101 --> 30:05.626
Sure, but l tell you what...

30:05.904 --> 30:09.305
...somebody on the other side
wants you dead.

30:09.574 --> 30:13.874
-l'm real scared. See me shaking?
-l sure as hell do.

30:14.279 --> 30:16.372
l've got a deal for you.

30:18.149 --> 30:23.052
You tell me about this guy,
and l can make it all go away.

30:23.288 --> 30:25.813
Put you under police protection.

30:26.090 --> 30:29.218
l honestly don't know anything.

30:29.460 --> 30:33.055
But even if l did,
l wouldn't give it to you.

30:34.766 --> 30:36.597
Suit yourself.

30:38.837 --> 30:42.238
Last chance to arrest me,
Detective Zedkov.

30:43.441 --> 30:45.568
l didn't think so.

30:49.681 --> 30:52.878
Oh, by the way, tell whoever
you're gonna put on my tail...

30:53.051 --> 30:55.349
...that l'm gonna lose them
on 6th Street.

30:57.188 --> 30:58.587
Put Morris and Duke on her.

30:58.756 --> 31:01.725
-Why not charge her?
-She's red meat.

31:01.960 --> 31:05.521
l'll put her on a hook
and see what the dogs do.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.825
Shit!

33:10.154 --> 33:12.850
Jesus Christ!

33:14.659 --> 33:17.150
What the hell are you doing here?

33:17.862 --> 33:19.557
l still need papers.

33:20.498 --> 33:21.795
Yeah, great.

33:22.066 --> 33:25.558
You expect me to cook
a passport with crayons?

33:25.770 --> 33:30.400
Take a look around.
Anything not shot up, the cops took.

33:30.975 --> 33:34.672
My $3000 computer
is now a paperweight.

33:34.912 --> 33:39.406
Four years of work down the drain
because you picked my door.

33:39.617 --> 33:41.517
-We go to Eddie.
-Why?

33:41.786 --> 33:43.310
For help.

33:43.521 --> 33:47.116
l'm not going with you.
You're a walking bull's-eye.

33:47.325 --> 33:50.817
So are you. You're safer with me.

33:51.929 --> 33:53.658
ls it my perfume?

33:53.898 --> 33:58.631
You're the second guy today
who thinks l'd accept help. l won't.

33:59.437 --> 34:00.995
lt's not an option.

34:04.542 --> 34:08.170
What happens when l tell you
to go fuck yourself?

34:12.216 --> 34:13.614
Okay.

34:14.418 --> 34:16.944
lf that's how you wanna play it.

34:17.188 --> 34:21.056
But when the gun's in my hand,
we'll talk again.

34:23.860 --> 34:27.353
Okay, Nick, what do you got for me?

34:27.632 --> 34:29.156
How about it?

34:30.635 --> 34:35.197
-My kid works faster.
-l'm trying, there's not much there.

34:37.241 --> 34:39.175
Okay, l think l got it.

34:40.143 --> 34:42.078
There's your ghost.

34:49.654 --> 34:51.713
Good stuff, come on.

35:24.555 --> 35:26.079
Hey!

35:26.557 --> 35:29.219
Next time kidnap someone
with a Bentley.

35:36.234 --> 35:38.828
So how'd you piss off Terence Wei?

35:40.304 --> 35:41.965
Cops told me.

35:46.677 --> 35:49.942
-What did you say?
-l didn't say nothing.

35:50.114 --> 35:51.604
What, you think l'm an idiot?

35:51.782 --> 35:55.274
l know you got me mixed up in
some Chinatown gangster bullshit.

35:55.453 --> 35:56.886
Less l know, better.

36:01.159 --> 36:02.285
Buckle up.

36:41.699 --> 36:42.688
Eddie?

36:43.534 --> 36:44.899
Let's go.

36:59.917 --> 37:01.077
Eddie?

37:04.956 --> 37:06.583
Oh, shit.

37:08.159 --> 37:09.524
Eddie.

37:22.473 --> 37:24.600
You two make a cute couple.

37:26.077 --> 37:28.272
You're welcome to try.

37:31.349 --> 37:32.338
Take his gun.

37:32.683 --> 37:33.945
Check them.

37:47.832 --> 37:52.929
l beat my head against the wall
trying to anticipate your next move.

37:55.840 --> 37:58.707
l beat Eddie's head
against the wall...

37:58.943 --> 38:01.639
...trying to anticipate
your next move.

38:05.650 --> 38:08.949
Mr. Wei will be pleased
we found you.

38:09.186 --> 38:10.312
Okay.

38:10.521 --> 38:12.887
This has nothing to do with me.

38:13.124 --> 38:16.355
l'll just walk out
and pretend l saw nothing.

38:16.694 --> 38:20.824
l'm sorry, Meg, but you're in
a little too deep.

38:21.232 --> 38:24.133
-You picked the wrong partner.
-Partner?

38:24.368 --> 38:27.098
No, wait.
l'm his hostage.

38:27.305 --> 38:32.106
l just met this guy yesterday.
He told me his name was John Lee.

38:36.047 --> 38:38.140
His name is John Lee.

38:38.416 --> 38:42.512
You know what happens to hostages.
They tend to get killed.

38:44.722 --> 38:46.246
Cuff him.

38:49.160 --> 38:50.320
Cuff them both.

39:02.773 --> 39:04.206
Shit!

39:12.516 --> 39:14.416
How's that leg?

39:21.392 --> 39:22.381
How's yours?

40:17.915 --> 40:19.906
Bring the car around.

40:20.284 --> 40:21.842
Flush him out!

42:38.622 --> 42:40.249
Oh, fuck!

42:51.135 --> 42:53.626
l wondered if you
were coming back.

43:04.114 --> 43:06.105
-Get down!
-Oh, shit!

43:09.320 --> 43:10.912
Get in!

43:24.635 --> 43:26.603
Keys! Take the keys!

43:27.805 --> 43:28.794
Give me a gun!

43:35.980 --> 43:38.005
Get this car moving!
Come on!

43:39.917 --> 43:41.509
Move the car! Go!

44:13.517 --> 44:15.747
Put the gun down!

44:24.094 --> 44:25.994
Oh, shit!

45:05.302 --> 45:07.702
Another problem, Mr. Kogan.

45:08.772 --> 45:14.142
-John was lucky. lt won't last.
-Don't confuse luck with skill.

45:17.314 --> 45:20.283
l served with John's father
in China.

45:20.517 --> 45:23.315
He was an honorable man.

45:23.554 --> 45:26.045
But he could be ruthless.

45:27.091 --> 45:29.150
John is like him.

45:32.796 --> 45:37.631
-Where are John's replacements?
-Arriving as we speak.

47:06.223 --> 47:07.520
lt's gonna hurt.

47:07.958 --> 47:09.619
Just do it.

47:23.140 --> 47:26.541
l told you we'd have
this conversation again.

47:26.910 --> 47:29.071
You son of a bitch.

47:29.479 --> 47:32.778
What did you get me into
with Terence Wei?

47:35.352 --> 47:37.320
He's my patron.

47:37.554 --> 47:38.885
Patron?

47:43.861 --> 47:46.091
He made it possible
for me to come here.

47:46.263 --> 47:48.857
What, does he sponsor you
to play the violin?

47:50.667 --> 47:52.692
ln exchange for...

47:54.371 --> 47:55.633
...services.

47:56.840 --> 47:59.536
What a nice way of saying
you kill people.

48:03.180 --> 48:05.045
Did you think you could
fuck Terence Wei?

48:07.251 --> 48:09.515
Did you think you could
fuck Terence Wei?!

48:17.194 --> 48:20.163
And now his foot soldiers are
all over the streets looking for you.

48:20.998 --> 48:22.226
And for me.

48:22.699 --> 48:24.166
Put your gun down.

48:24.334 --> 48:27.497
Now would you let me walk
out that door?

48:30.207 --> 48:32.266
l didn't think so.

48:33.176 --> 48:36.509
You're not leaving me with a whole
hell of a lot of options, are you?

48:40.951 --> 48:42.316
Do it.

48:44.321 --> 48:45.413
Do it.

48:51.728 --> 48:55.129
Shoot me! Do it! Do it!

48:55.866 --> 48:58.994
Do it right now! l'll do it for you.

49:18.622 --> 49:20.385
l'm sorry.

49:31.301 --> 49:33.792
Then tell me what the fuck
is going on!

49:37.941 --> 49:41.001
Our situation in China is difficult.

49:42.646 --> 49:44.773
l was born a soldier.

49:47.517 --> 49:49.678
l've seen people die.

49:54.491 --> 49:56.618
All l ever wanted...

49:56.893 --> 49:59.521
...was for my family to be safe.

50:00.964 --> 50:03.489
l would do anything
to protect them.

50:05.168 --> 50:06.829
Anything.

50:11.041 --> 50:13.908
Mr. Wei used my mother
and sister...

50:14.277 --> 50:17.269
...to persuade me to do three jobs.

50:19.816 --> 50:22.284
The first two were criminals.

50:23.920 --> 50:25.854
lt wasn't difficult.

50:27.791 --> 50:29.019
And the third?

50:34.598 --> 50:36.156
l couldn't do it.

50:41.905 --> 50:44.465
lf l don't get back to China...

50:49.346 --> 50:51.337
...my family will die.

50:58.522 --> 51:03.255
You picked a very bad day
to grow such a selective conscience.

51:30.620 --> 51:32.986
But they chose me.

51:41.965 --> 51:42.954
<i>Hello?</i>

52:10.961 --> 52:12.952
What was that all about?

52:13.663 --> 52:15.460
l have a passport.

52:16.366 --> 52:19.233
Fix it for me.
Then you can go.

52:20.504 --> 52:23.166
My family is running out of time.

52:26.143 --> 52:28.168
l'll need a picture.

52:36.753 --> 52:38.948
This time it's two jobs.

52:39.122 --> 52:41.113
But it's the two of you.

52:42.425 --> 52:44.154
John is more trouble
than we thought.

52:47.397 --> 52:49.126
So, what's the time frame?

52:49.299 --> 52:50.926
lmmediate.

52:56.106 --> 52:58.131
So l'm just curious...

52:58.308 --> 53:01.402
...what made you assume
l could jack a car?

53:02.112 --> 53:03.739
Lucky guess.

53:05.248 --> 53:07.944
Your mother or your father?

53:08.485 --> 53:10.680
<i>Mechanics lllustrated.</i>

53:13.190 --> 53:15.215
My father taught me how to shoot.

53:16.359 --> 53:18.156
Playing catch is so impersonal.

53:20.197 --> 53:23.997
He was a general.
A very important man.

53:25.435 --> 53:26.959
Was?

53:27.470 --> 53:29.028
What happened?

53:33.143 --> 53:37.341
He was re-educated
in the cultural revolution.

53:37.614 --> 53:38.945
What does that mean?

53:43.086 --> 53:46.544
Anyone who disagreed with
Chairman Mao was made loyal.

53:47.390 --> 53:49.620
Families were punished.

53:49.893 --> 53:53.385
Many were beaten,
tortured, shamed.

53:57.867 --> 54:00.335
And how did a general
get re-educated?

54:05.909 --> 54:07.069
By his son.

54:10.113 --> 54:11.239
When l got older...

54:11.815 --> 54:13.578
...l promised...

54:14.351 --> 54:17.047
...l would get my mother
and sister out of China.

54:37.641 --> 54:39.973
What do you mean,
that's all you got?

54:40.677 --> 54:43.612
Give me the money.
Get the fuck out of here!

54:54.391 --> 54:55.517
What's up, Meg?

54:56.192 --> 54:58.387
-You look good!
-Not today, Loco.

54:59.129 --> 55:01.120
What's with the attitude?

55:01.364 --> 55:05.460
You need to spend time with me.
Get some of this love.

55:06.403 --> 55:07.961
Meet my new friend.

55:09.572 --> 55:11.767
What's up, ''friend''?

55:12.342 --> 55:14.037
Ain't no harm.

55:14.544 --> 55:17.172
No harm, right?

55:22.852 --> 55:24.080
Old boyfriend?

55:24.321 --> 55:26.482
l stick to my own species.

55:26.723 --> 55:30.318
Here we are.
Fastest passport photos in town.

55:43.740 --> 55:45.901
Now, give me three bucks.

55:47.677 --> 55:51.169
Hostage etiquette.
Kidnappers pay for incidentals.

55:54.551 --> 55:56.576
Thank you very much.

55:59.322 --> 56:00.949
You gave me four.

56:02.892 --> 56:04.450
l'll take it as a tip.

56:05.829 --> 56:08.696
Sit still and stare
straight ahead.

56:17.040 --> 56:21.409
You could have saved yourself
trouble by doing that third job.

56:22.912 --> 56:24.402
lt was wrong.

56:26.149 --> 56:29.118
Mr. Wei was taking revenge.

56:29.586 --> 56:32.282
A man named Zedkov
killed his son.

56:33.123 --> 56:34.351
Zedkov?

56:35.158 --> 56:38.218
You're getting yourself killed
for a cop?

56:39.162 --> 56:40.959
Not a cop.

56:42.665 --> 56:43.723
His son.

56:44.100 --> 56:45.124
What?

56:47.103 --> 56:49.435
A seven-year-old boy.

56:59.416 --> 57:00.508
Why?

57:02.485 --> 57:06.251
That is how Mr. Wei deals
with his enemies.

57:06.956 --> 57:08.947
Through the families.

57:21.337 --> 57:23.771
You're done.
Get out of there.

57:54.871 --> 57:56.930
Picture's not done yet.

58:03.746 --> 58:06.180
We'll have to wait
a few minutes.

58:06.382 --> 58:08.475
Don't turn around.

58:09.486 --> 58:10.714
Cops?

58:11.254 --> 58:12.551
No.

58:13.356 --> 58:15.051
Assassins.

59:06.276 --> 59:08.267
Stay close to me, okay?

59:08.511 --> 59:10.001
Now!

01:00:20.283 --> 01:00:21.580
Let's go!

01:00:25.622 --> 01:00:26.680
John!

01:01:16.472 --> 01:01:17.461
Hello?

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:19.699
Hey, champ.
How you doing?

01:01:19.909 --> 01:01:21.274
Dad!

01:01:21.544 --> 01:01:24.138
-What are you up to?
-<i>MaKing a shaKe.</i>

01:01:25.014 --> 01:01:27.141
Listen to this.

01:01:28.017 --> 01:01:30.247
<i>Stevie, let me talK to your</i>--

01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:36.922
Two officers down in a shootout.
Gotta move now.

01:01:39.195 --> 01:01:42.164
Stevie! Stevie!
Stop it, would you?

01:01:43.099 --> 01:01:44.964
Daddy's gotta go work now.

01:01:45.201 --> 01:01:47.897
Are you canceling tonight?

01:01:51.074 --> 01:01:52.063
<i>l wouldn't.</i>

01:01:52.241 --> 01:01:55.472
-<i>You promised we'd go to the movies.</i>
-<i>We are.</i>

01:01:55.712 --> 01:01:59.239
<i>l'm gonna taKe you to see</i>
<i>the cartoon....</i>

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:06.980
That kid turns that blender on
one more time...

01:02:07.156 --> 01:02:09.021
...l'm gonna shoot him myself.

01:02:09.192 --> 01:02:11.626
Then l would have to kill you.

01:02:13.262 --> 01:02:18.131
Wei specifically wants the kid's brains
dumped in Daddy's lap, my friend.

01:03:12.622 --> 01:03:13.611
Alan.

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:16.614
Alan!

01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:19.122
Alan!

01:05:35.131 --> 01:05:40.125
How will you get to the airport
with those two killers after you?

01:05:40.336 --> 01:05:41.803
They won't be.

01:05:42.004 --> 01:05:44.871
They're here to finish my job.

01:05:45.675 --> 01:05:48.701
Zedkov's boy must die in his arms.

01:05:49.812 --> 01:05:52.645
Then he will share Mr. Wei's pain.

01:05:53.649 --> 01:05:56.550
Zeedo's son for your family. Wow.

01:05:56.919 --> 01:05:59.046
lt's a hell of a choice.

01:06:02.892 --> 01:06:04.723
People die.

01:06:05.594 --> 01:06:07.619
Children die.

01:06:07.797 --> 01:06:09.492
People die.

01:06:11.367 --> 01:06:13.096
Children die.

01:06:16.405 --> 01:06:20.136
The same thing happens to your
family if you don't get there first.

01:06:22.411 --> 01:06:25.710
When l was a kid, my mom
was kind of a weak woman.

01:06:25.881 --> 01:06:28.714
She couldn't make her own money,
so we always had boyfriends...

01:06:28.884 --> 01:06:32.718
...in and out of the house.
The one that stuck was Lester.

01:06:32.888 --> 01:06:35.015
He used to beat on her.

01:06:35.491 --> 01:06:37.857
And when l would stand up for her...

01:06:38.894 --> 01:06:41.158
...he would belt me in the mouth.

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:43.389
So...

01:06:43.566 --> 01:06:45.033
...l learned to shut up.

01:06:46.535 --> 01:06:47.968
Then l hit 1 4...

01:06:48.137 --> 01:06:52.267
...and l was passing for 2 1
in all the local bars.

01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:56.167
And old Lester started getting
real friendly with me.

01:06:56.812 --> 01:06:58.404
So that was it.

01:06:58.581 --> 01:07:01.311
l was out of there, clean. Only l...

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:05.047
...left a 1 0-year-old brother behind.

01:07:06.155 --> 01:07:07.986
Named Joseph.

01:07:08.657 --> 01:07:11.683
l-- l-- l thought he would be okay,
you know...

01:07:12.228 --> 01:07:14.287
...because he was a boy...

01:07:14.463 --> 01:07:16.931
...and l didn't think Lester
would touch him.

01:07:20.536 --> 01:07:22.197
And one night Lester just...

01:07:22.371 --> 01:07:25.272
...put Joey's head
through the kitchen wall.

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:33.009
People die.

01:07:36.085 --> 01:07:37.916
Children die.

01:07:59.408 --> 01:08:01.808
l've spent whole days
thinking about that one thing.

01:08:02.011 --> 01:08:06.175
That one good deed that'll
wipe out all the shit l've done.

01:08:07.883 --> 01:08:09.817
You ever feel like that?

01:08:12.988 --> 01:08:17.220
You didn't want to shoot a kid.
Welcome to the human race.

01:08:19.694 --> 01:08:23.721
Standing aside is no different
from pulling the trigger.

01:08:33.908 --> 01:08:34.933
Here.

01:08:36.545 --> 01:08:39.104
Now that's some of my best work.

01:08:43.819 --> 01:08:45.582
Have a nice trip.

01:09:14.917 --> 01:09:17.283
l'll need guns.

01:09:39.375 --> 01:09:40.433
What the fuck?!

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:47.979
-You picked the wrong place.
-Oh, yeah?

01:09:48.184 --> 01:09:52.120
Why don't we see if the jury
will stand up for a rat?

01:09:59.628 --> 01:10:02.791
What's the story, Loco?
Should l dump on him?

01:10:03.032 --> 01:10:05.660
No, no, no.
No, don't trip.

01:10:06.101 --> 01:10:09.628
-l got it all under control.
-That's good.

01:10:09.838 --> 01:10:11.897
Now get up. Get up!

01:10:15.144 --> 01:10:17.135
Keep the dice warm.

01:10:33.062 --> 01:10:35.121
Righteous, these are my people.

01:10:37.233 --> 01:10:39.463
lt ain't what you're thinking.

01:10:39.702 --> 01:10:42.364
You're marked with
every drug dealer.

01:10:42.571 --> 01:10:45.631
lf l'd been seen with you
and hadn't called....

01:10:45.874 --> 01:10:48.365
l'd cause myself unnecessary drama.

01:10:48.577 --> 01:10:51.341
We wouldn't want that,
now would we?

01:11:02.858 --> 01:11:04.587
Break out the munitions.

01:11:05.027 --> 01:11:07.587
That .45 is all l got.

01:11:08.864 --> 01:11:10.525
You sure about that?

01:11:22.411 --> 01:11:26.404
l forgot about that one.
You can have that. That's on me.

01:11:26.615 --> 01:11:27.843
Your keys.

01:11:28.083 --> 01:11:30.574
Say what? No, no.
You're tripping.

01:11:30.786 --> 01:11:32.720
You stand by your product?

01:11:33.889 --> 01:11:36.585
You're gonna bust me a cap
right here?

01:11:51.073 --> 01:11:53.007
Can you make that louder?

01:11:53.242 --> 01:11:57.042
There ain't nothing in there.
You got both my straps.

01:12:20.836 --> 01:12:23.100
Thank for the ride, Loc.

01:12:30.813 --> 01:12:32.940
How am l supposed to get home?

01:12:33.182 --> 01:12:37.050
You've seen our car.
Twist the red and the yellow wires.

01:13:56.632 --> 01:13:58.190
<i>Mister Magoo!</i>

01:13:58.434 --> 01:14:01.369

<i>Under cover, everyone!</i>

<i>Over.</i>

01:15:01.763 --> 01:15:02.957
<i>Great Scott!</i>

01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:33.753
Zedkov, get your kid down!

01:16:15.370 --> 01:16:16.530
Go!

01:16:17.139 --> 01:16:19.164
Hold on! Hold on, Stevie!

01:16:24.479 --> 01:16:25.537
We'll be okay!

01:16:33.021 --> 01:16:35.319
Get him out! l'll cover you.

01:16:37.593 --> 01:16:38.890
Okay, okay!

01:16:39.394 --> 01:16:40.418
Go!

01:16:40.662 --> 01:16:42.220
Run! Run!

01:17:06.755 --> 01:17:08.586
lt's my boy.

01:17:09.925 --> 01:17:12.120
They went after my kid.

01:17:12.761 --> 01:17:16.094
Listen to me.
We're gonna lock down this city.

01:17:17.332 --> 01:17:19.027
lt's not them.

01:17:20.869 --> 01:17:24.134
Coburn and her pal
saved my ass tonight.

01:17:24.406 --> 01:17:25.703
What?

01:17:28.977 --> 01:17:31.104
They saved my son.

01:17:38.153 --> 01:17:39.643
Come here, boy.

01:17:43.091 --> 01:17:46.356
-How you doing? You still scared?
-Yeah.

01:17:46.561 --> 01:17:49.621
Yeah.
Yeah, me too.

01:17:50.165 --> 01:17:53.134
Come on.
You sit here in the car.

01:18:00.642 --> 01:18:01.973
Come here.

01:18:04.012 --> 01:18:06.173
-Guess what?
-What?

01:18:06.448 --> 01:18:08.643
-l love you.
-l love you too.

01:18:10.886 --> 01:18:13.252
-Hey!
-You got the keys?

01:18:13.689 --> 01:18:17.819
Have them take him to his mother's.
Put them under guard.

01:18:18.126 --> 01:18:20.959
Pick somebody good.
l want them safe.

01:18:21.196 --> 01:18:23.460
Should we tell her what's going on?

01:18:24.032 --> 01:18:27.468
-Tell her what you want.
-What are you doing?

01:19:01.169 --> 01:19:02.659
John?

01:19:04.473 --> 01:19:06.441
Call Zedkov.

01:19:07.476 --> 01:19:09.341
He knows now.

01:19:09.745 --> 01:19:11.645
You'll be safe.

01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:14.075
Safe?

01:19:15.217 --> 01:19:17.048
What about you?

01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:21.648
My family is not protected.

01:19:23.058 --> 01:19:25.185
So, what are you gonna do?

01:19:25.961 --> 01:19:28.953
Kill all of Chinatown
just to get to Wei?

01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:33.730
l cannot run from battle.

01:19:34.603 --> 01:19:36.662
From what l am.

01:19:41.777 --> 01:19:45.213
There's a difference between
battle and suicide.

01:19:46.181 --> 01:19:48.741
lt would be
the last death l cause.

01:19:51.987 --> 01:19:53.545
Fair enough.

01:19:56.925 --> 01:19:59.689
Okay, John. Let's go.

01:20:01.096 --> 01:20:03.360
You saved the boy.

01:20:03.799 --> 01:20:06.267
This is not your fight.

01:20:07.269 --> 01:20:08.998
l know.

01:20:09.905 --> 01:20:13.773
But l've developed a problem
with watching you die.

01:20:29.057 --> 01:20:31.525
l have the same problem with you.

01:20:33.328 --> 01:20:35.728
l believe he'll come here next.

01:20:35.997 --> 01:20:37.658
So will Zedkov.

01:20:37.899 --> 01:20:40.595
We shouldn't wait
for either of them.

01:20:40.802 --> 01:20:42.633
Of course not.

01:20:43.104 --> 01:20:46.369
Call the airport,
then our men in Shanghai.

01:20:46.608 --> 01:20:50.738
You'll handle his mother and
sister before John gets to them.

01:20:50.979 --> 01:20:52.207
And me?

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:53.913
Stay here.

01:20:54.182 --> 01:20:56.207
Earn what you were paid for.

01:25:01.763 --> 01:25:03.390
Hey, hey, hey!

01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:03.355
Meg.

01:26:07.629 --> 01:26:09.324
l'm gonna find you.

01:26:24.879 --> 01:26:27.541
But you could save me time...

01:26:28.183 --> 01:26:30.481
...and put a bullet in your head.

01:26:31.219 --> 01:26:33.813
lf the position were reversed...

01:26:34.222 --> 01:26:36.520
...l'd do the same for you.

01:26:45.667 --> 01:26:47.157
Are you?

01:26:51.005 --> 01:26:52.336
Excuse me?

01:26:53.374 --> 01:26:57.777
Gonna put a bullet in your head
since our positions are reversed?

01:26:59.013 --> 01:27:00.412
Meg, it doesn't--

01:27:15.296 --> 01:27:16.923
l didn't think so.

01:27:26.608 --> 01:27:28.439
Checkmate.

01:28:01.809 --> 01:28:04.107
The boy will die, John...

01:28:04.646 --> 01:28:06.807
...as well as your family.

01:28:07.482 --> 01:28:09.950
Not in your lifetime.

01:29:53.921 --> 01:29:55.445
John?

01:30:33.795 --> 01:30:36.320
Zeedo! Zeedo!

01:30:40.735 --> 01:30:42.396
What's going on, man?

01:30:43.905 --> 01:30:45.497
They're gone.

01:31:05.026 --> 01:31:06.584
Hey.

01:31:07.361 --> 01:31:08.851
Hi.

01:31:11.098 --> 01:31:13.658
l brought you a
going-away present.

01:31:23.311 --> 01:31:25.142
For your family.

01:31:27.014 --> 01:31:28.481
Thank you.

01:31:32.253 --> 01:31:36.815
l've never made one for someone
l didn't want to see leave.

01:31:48.402 --> 01:31:52.168
This was a lot easier when
they were shooting at us.

01:32:02.316 --> 01:32:04.181
l will miss you.
