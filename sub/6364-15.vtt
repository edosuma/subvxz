12:47.200 --> 12:49.134
It disrupts
the electrical communication

12:49.136 --> 12:52.203
Between your nerves
and your neural transmitters.

12:52.205 --> 12:53.972
You want to make contact
with the torso,

12:53.974 --> 12:56.307
Which is shoulders, pelvis,

12:56.309 --> 12:57.308
Abdomen, groin--

12:57.310 --> 13:00.044
S-p-a-g.

13:00.046 --> 13:01.813
Come on, man,
let's get on with it, all right?

13:01.815 --> 13:03.481
Due time, due time.

13:03.483 --> 13:05.884
Now, you all need to be
tasered to be certified.

13:05.886 --> 13:07.085
It is completely harmless,

13:07.087 --> 13:09.487
But you will know
what it feels like to be juiced,

13:09.489 --> 13:13.258
Which will allow you
to definitively testify in court

13:13.260 --> 13:14.993
On the reaction
to the electrical expos--

13:14.995 --> 13:16.194
Yeah, we get it, man, okay?
We get it.

13:16.196 --> 13:17.362
Oh, good, a volunteer.

13:17.364 --> 13:20.498
- [groaning]
- whoa, whoa, whoa, oh.

13:20.500 --> 13:23.501
[groans]

13:23.503 --> 13:26.504
[laughter]

13:26.506 --> 13:28.907
That was worth the price
of admission.

13:28.909 --> 13:30.375
You're next.

13:31.478 --> 13:34.279
- Come on, man.
- I volunteer to tase him.

13:37.150 --> 13:40.518
Okay, i mean, this doesn't
seem, like, official enough.

13:40.520 --> 13:43.188
Where do you want it?

13:43.190 --> 13:46.858
S-p-a or g?

13:46.860 --> 13:48.026
- Shoulders.
- G.

13:48.028 --> 13:49.394
- G.

13:49.396 --> 13:52.864
- G, g.
- Don't you dare.

13:58.305 --> 14:01.906
What's your name?

14:01.908 --> 14:06.377
- What?
- What's--what's your name?

14:06.379 --> 14:08.880
Burgess, kim.

14:08.882 --> 14:11.316
You been a cop long,
burgess, kim?

14:11.318 --> 14:13.218
A few years.

14:20.927 --> 14:23.928
What's with all this soap
and baby formula?

14:23.930 --> 14:25.363
That?

14:25.365 --> 14:29.033
That's liquid gold, right there.

14:29.035 --> 14:33.371
Them chinese pay five,
ten times the cost.

14:33.373 --> 14:36.374
[grunting]

14:40.380 --> 14:41.946
You know, even if you're not
bleeding out,

14:41.948 --> 14:44.082
You're bleeding inside.

14:44.083 --> 14:46.217
That'll kill you if you
don't do something about it.

14:46.219 --> 14:49.020
You think i'm afraid to die?

14:49.022 --> 14:52.957
I know that i am,
and--i'll admit it.

14:52.959 --> 14:54.225
I'm afraid to die,

14:54.227 --> 14:56.461
And i don't want anyone else
to die here, either.

14:56.463 --> 14:58.429
Not even you.

14:58.431 --> 15:01.366
You awfully mouthy.

15:01.368 --> 15:04.369
I get that a lot.

15:04.371 --> 15:05.970
(male voice on phone)
yo, chang, i'm pulling up now.

15:05.972 --> 15:09.040
Open the door.

15:10.343 --> 15:11.476
[mutters]

15:12.646 --> 15:14.479
(male voice)
yo, chang, open up.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.252
- [mutters]
- yeah.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.454
(male voice)
yo, open up!

15:31.631 --> 15:33.197
[banging on door]

15:33.199 --> 15:35.700
Yo, chang, open up!
What's going on in there?

15:38.571 --> 15:40.405
Hello?

15:40.407 --> 15:42.373
(male voice)
who's this?

15:42.375 --> 15:43.508
Not chang. The cops.

15:43.510 --> 15:44.943
We got a dozen officers in here.

15:44.945 --> 15:46.711
I want you to toss your guns,
put your hands up,

15:46.713 --> 15:49.113
And walk slowly
inside this warehouse.

15:49.115 --> 15:50.114
I'm not--

15:50.116 --> 15:53.051
[footsteps running away]

15:53.053 --> 15:54.052
[car door shuts]

15:54.054 --> 15:56.387
[engine turns]

15:58.425 --> 16:01.159
Hey!
Don't think about it.

16:01.161 --> 16:03.428
Put it down.

16:03.430 --> 16:05.363
Put it down.

16:08.735 --> 16:10.301
[gunshot]
ahh!

16:10.303 --> 16:11.736
You gonna try to dial 911.

16:11.738 --> 16:13.271
- No, i wasn't.
- Don't lie to me, kim.

16:13.273 --> 16:15.273
I wasn't. I swear!

16:21.214 --> 16:25.650
No, just--just walked in,
popped me square in the jaw.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.385
I was so surprised,
i hit the ground.

16:27.387 --> 16:30.221
I mean, ass on the floor,
no lie.

16:30.223 --> 16:31.990
What,
and you didn't retaliate?

16:31.992 --> 16:37.028
I was--i was in a bad place,
you know? Justin.

16:37.030 --> 16:39.530
I crossed the line.

16:39.532 --> 16:42.000
I mean, he's a firefighter
in boden's house.

16:45.071 --> 16:49.140
I mean, it's water
under the bridge.

16:49.142 --> 16:51.509
Got any more curly fries?

16:51.511 --> 16:53.211
[taser zapping]

16:53.213 --> 16:54.679
[groaning]

16:54.681 --> 16:58.116
As you see, the bigger they
are, the harder they drop.

16:58.118 --> 17:01.119
50,000 volts is nothing
to sniff at.

17:01.121 --> 17:02.587
Hey, burgess, it's me.

17:02.589 --> 17:04.521
Listen, they've got us doing
this stupid taser training

17:04.523 --> 17:07.224
Course, so i'm caught up here.

17:07.227 --> 17:08.659
Anyway, give me a call,

17:08.661 --> 17:11.128
Or bring some food
up to the bull pen.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.230
Don't be mad. All right.

17:12.232 --> 17:13.431
Hey, sundance kid,

17:13.433 --> 17:16.300
You mind joining us or you want
to get the juice again?

17:16.301 --> 17:19.137
Trust me, i want to get out
of here just as bad as you do.

17:19.138 --> 17:21.172
- Coming.
- Okay, then.

17:21.174 --> 17:23.307
You're up, lady.

17:24.810 --> 17:27.310
Oh, i--
i think we've seen enough.

17:27.313 --> 17:30.148
Oh, the x26 does not
discriminate by gender.

17:30.150 --> 17:33.151
- March it over here.
- It's payback time.

17:35.255 --> 17:38.389
Hey, man, so you know
my name.

17:38.391 --> 17:39.590
What's yours?

17:39.592 --> 17:42.226
My name's
don't ask me my name.

17:42.228 --> 17:45.563
Fine, you can just be,
"man."

17:45.565 --> 17:47.799
So listen, man, we can't just
sit here and pretend

17:47.801 --> 17:50.535
That, like,
everything's gonna be okay.

17:50.537 --> 17:51.836
You're injured
and so is my partner.

17:51.838 --> 17:53.604
I'm not gonna--i'm not gonna
endanger his life--

17:53.606 --> 17:55.540
- I'm already dead.
- No, you don't know that.

17:55.542 --> 17:58.543
The things i've seen--i mean,
doctors today--

17:58.545 --> 18:00.178
They can perform miracles.

18:00.180 --> 18:03.081
If we get you into an ambulance,
you have a chance.

18:03.083 --> 18:05.783
Naw, i'm dead either way.

18:05.785 --> 18:09.687
This bullet or jail--i'm not
doing the second one again,

18:09.689 --> 18:12.323
So i might as well
die by the first.

18:15.095 --> 18:18.262
You ever been inside?

18:18.264 --> 18:20.731
Yeah, yeah,
i worked six months

18:22.235 --> 18:23.935
Booking at cook county.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.636
So you know.

18:25.638 --> 18:27.805
I know.

18:27.807 --> 18:31.576
Would you wish that on anyone?

18:31.578 --> 18:34.145
I wouldn't.

18:37.851 --> 18:41.652
I did two years
in a place called kentville.

18:41.654 --> 18:43.154
You heard of it?

18:43.156 --> 18:45.423
Juvie.

18:45.425 --> 18:47.825
I got arrested at 15
for lifting money out

18:47.827 --> 18:51.395
The register at this shoe store
i was working at.

18:51.397 --> 18:53.831
The cop who came told the owner

18:53.833 --> 18:59.537
If he charged me,
i'd be swept into the system.

18:59.539 --> 19:03.207
"can we let this slide?"

19:03.209 --> 19:06.210
And you know what the owner
told him?

19:06.212 --> 19:10.615
Said i was never gonna
be a damn thing.

19:10.617 --> 19:14.819
So i went to kentville,
and that was that.

19:20.493 --> 19:25.163
Yeah, i hear you.

19:25.165 --> 19:27.865
It's hard to, you know,
turn ships

19:27.867 --> 19:30.434
Once you're sailing
downwind,

19:30.436 --> 19:32.837
But see, that officer--look,

19:32.839 --> 19:33.905
The one who answered the call--

19:33.907 --> 19:36.307
He tried to give that owner
a way out.

19:36.309 --> 19:37.909
The police did that for you.

19:37.911 --> 19:39.844
Oh, yeah, the police,

19:39.846 --> 19:42.780
You know, always looking out
for black kids in chicago.

19:42.782 --> 19:44.882
Nobody else is.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.036
There were over 400 murders
in chicago last year.

19:48.037 --> 19:49.220
You think that's the po-lice?

19:49.222 --> 19:51.289
No, that's kids
just shooting other kids

19:51.291 --> 19:53.824
In their own neighborhoods.

19:53.826 --> 19:56.527
- There it is.
- I'm just telling you facts.

19:56.529 --> 19:57.895
You don't want to listen?
That's on you.

19:57.897 --> 20:01.666
Facts--you gonna boil
down 100 years of oppression,

20:01.668 --> 20:04.702
Harassment, racism, brutality,
and all that to a,

20:04.704 --> 20:07.638
"hey, you animals
do this to each other"?

20:07.640 --> 20:09.874
And just when i was starting
to think better of you.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.375
(burgess)
it's not that simple.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.945
You should see
the things i've seen.

20:13.947 --> 20:15.446
(man)
i do. Trust me.

20:15.448 --> 20:17.682
(burgess)
all right,
but let me just say this.

20:17.684 --> 20:20.585
There's good and bad
in every organization, right?

20:20.587 --> 20:22.453
Every business in the country--

20:22.455 --> 20:24.555
It's human nature,
or the law of averages,

20:24.557 --> 20:27.658
Or whatever you want to call it,
but i have seen a lot more cops

20:27.660 --> 20:30.628
Who care than i have
the other way around.

20:30.630 --> 20:33.431
- Right.
- I'm serious.

20:33.433 --> 20:36.434
When cops get together,
you know what stories they tell?

20:36.436 --> 20:38.569
It's not the ones of shootings
and drug busts and--

20:38.571 --> 20:41.439
And dumb criminals
doing dumb things.

20:41.441 --> 20:45.843
No, it's--the ones they tell
are about helping people.

20:45.845 --> 20:48.512
This one time--this one time,

20:48.514 --> 20:51.849
I found this little boy
locked in a basement.

20:51.851 --> 20:54.018
His mom had mental problems.

20:54.020 --> 20:56.454
She kept him trapped
down there for years,

20:56.456 --> 20:58.456
And my partner and i were there
to arrest her for hoarding,

20:58.458 --> 21:00.558
Of all things.

21:00.560 --> 21:06.564
And i was this close to missing
him--like, this close.

21:06.566 --> 21:09.834
But i got lucky,
and i found him.

21:09.836 --> 21:12.503
Damn.

21:12.505 --> 21:15.006
So when i tell stories,

21:15.008 --> 21:17.842
That's the one
that comes to mind first.

21:21.881 --> 21:24.582
Aubrey.

21:24.584 --> 21:26.584
What?

21:26.586 --> 21:30.721
That's my name.
Aubrey.

21:30.723 --> 21:32.690
Aubrey carrington.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.559
Aubrey carrington.

21:38.765 --> 21:39.797
Aubrey, wait.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.999
- Wait, aubrey.
- Hey!

21:42.001 --> 21:45.403
Hey, no, don't do that.
Stop. Stop it.

21:45.405 --> 21:48.072
Stop doing that!
Aubrey, stop it!

21:48.074 --> 21:49.907
Shut up!
Just like all the rest.

21:49.909 --> 21:51.776
Trying to distract me
so he can knock me on the side

21:51.778 --> 21:53.311
Of the head with some pipe.

21:53.313 --> 21:56.447
I'm not.

21:56.449 --> 21:57.848
If you're gonna
shoot me then do it,

21:57.850 --> 22:00.885
But don't keep a cocked gun
pointed at my face.

22:05.892 --> 22:06.808
.

22:06.809 --> 22:07.725
- Damn it.
- [gasps]

22:11.864 --> 22:13.798
Damn it.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.066
- Damn it!
- Oh!

22:19.605 --> 22:21.105
Where you going? Huh?

22:21.107 --> 22:22.940
Where you going, huh?

22:24.510 --> 22:26.610
I'm getting you out of here.

22:28.815 --> 22:30.648
All right, listen to me,
aubrey.

22:33.119 --> 22:34.335
I'm walking out of here
with him.

22:34.336 --> 22:35.552
You may be a killer,
but you're not gonna kill me.

22:35.555 --> 22:36.721
Come on, sean, walk with me.

22:36.723 --> 22:37.855
It's gonna take me a few minutes

22:37.857 --> 22:40.991
To get from here to my squad
car, so take that time

22:40.993 --> 22:42.993
And get the hell out of here.
Do whatever you need to do.

22:42.995 --> 22:44.128
- I don't care.
- Stop.

22:44.130 --> 22:47.598
Stay there, sean.
Good luck, aubrey.

22:47.600 --> 22:50.401
You got to stop. Stop!

22:50.403 --> 22:54.405
Hey, the hell's this?

22:54.407 --> 22:55.639
Where y'all going?

22:55.641 --> 22:57.074
- What is this, a?
- He's been shot.

22:57.076 --> 22:58.843
My partner's been beaten.
We're leaving.

22:58.845 --> 23:00.845
Oh, nah, baby.
You not going nowhere.

23:00.847 --> 23:02.780
- Shut the door.
- Uh-uh.

23:02.782 --> 23:05.149
Shut the door.

23:06.652 --> 23:07.952
[groans]

23:07.954 --> 23:11.655
A, tell me what's going on.

23:14.761 --> 23:15.810
- What the--
- aubrey!

23:15.811 --> 23:16.860
A, wha--

23:16.863 --> 23:18.863
[gasping]

23:23.503 --> 23:24.869
She knows his name.

23:29.175 --> 23:31.542
Go on, yo.
Go on.

23:34.814 --> 23:38.749
Fix him.

23:38.751 --> 23:39.884
Help him, damn it.

23:39.886 --> 23:43.687
Okay, okay,
just--roman, just--over here.

23:43.689 --> 23:45.623
Oh, god.

23:45.625 --> 23:48.559
- Hurry up. Do something.
- I'm coming, okay?

23:48.561 --> 23:51.896
Just let the fool die.

23:53.599 --> 23:55.466
Aubrey...

23:55.468 --> 23:56.901
Oh, my god.

23:59.872 --> 24:01.472
Oh, man, it's nasty.

24:01.474 --> 24:04.508
[gasping]

24:08.147 --> 24:12.116
Okay, i don't know
what else to do.

24:12.118 --> 24:13.818
Don't look at me.

24:13.820 --> 24:16.887
I do.

24:16.889 --> 24:19.123
The bullet
collapsed his lung.

24:19.125 --> 24:20.157
We need something sharp.

24:20.159 --> 24:21.559
Like what?

24:21.561 --> 24:24.028
We need to let the air out.

24:24.030 --> 24:26.697
You, run to the store

24:26.699 --> 24:30.868
And get a straw and a knife
and wire if they got it.

24:30.870 --> 24:33.170
What? I--how--

24:33.172 --> 24:34.839
Hey, do you want him to live?

24:34.841 --> 24:35.806
Do it, or i'll--you know what?

24:35.808 --> 24:37.608
- I'll do it.
- Don't.

24:37.610 --> 24:41.479
He's my cousin, dog.

24:41.481 --> 24:43.481
Say--say, come on, man.

24:45.852 --> 24:47.218
Hold on, aubrey.

24:47.220 --> 24:49.220
Aubrey, hold on. I know.

24:49.222 --> 24:52.256
[gasping]

24:53.626 --> 24:57.761
O..Ri...On...

24:57.763 --> 24:59.096
Come on, man,
you gonna say my name?

24:59.098 --> 25:01.031
We didn't hear anything,
man.

25:01.033 --> 25:02.633
Step away from him.

25:02.635 --> 25:04.969
No, no, no, no,
don't do that.

25:04.971 --> 25:06.837
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
don't do that. Don't do that.

25:06.839 --> 25:08.806
- I said step away.
(roman) no, no, no!

25:14.714 --> 25:17.281
Kim, hey, what's up?

25:17.283 --> 25:19.016
I'm sorry i got jammed up here
today,

25:19.018 --> 25:20.985
But are you mad at me?

25:20.986 --> 25:22.953
There's nothing i would've liked
more than seeing you today.

25:22.955 --> 25:24.488
I know you know that.

25:24.489 --> 25:26.022
You need to call me back
so i know that you're okay.

25:26.025 --> 25:27.157
Please?

25:27.159 --> 25:29.693
Please call me back?

25:29.695 --> 25:30.728
[phone beeps off]

25:31.731 --> 25:32.963
No, man.

25:35.067 --> 25:38.102
(roman)
no, man,
you don't want to do this.

25:38.104 --> 25:39.770
No, man, don't do that.

25:39.772 --> 25:41.272
Shut the hell up.

25:41.273 --> 25:42.773
We don't care
what you're doing in here, man.

25:42.775 --> 25:44.909
We really don't. We're
just trying to help your friend.

25:44.911 --> 25:46.310
He messed up.

25:46.312 --> 25:48.579
(roman)
you gonna shoot him for that?

25:48.581 --> 25:50.781
You just gonna murder him
for saying your name

25:50.783 --> 25:52.716
With his dying breath?

25:52.718 --> 25:56.086
Yeah, you're exactly
what's wrong with chicago.

25:56.088 --> 25:58.322
You don't know
nothing about nothing.

25:58.324 --> 25:59.857
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

25:59.859 --> 26:01.959
I know this is all stupid.

26:01.961 --> 26:03.661
And for what?

26:03.663 --> 26:06.263
For that junk?

26:06.265 --> 26:09.700
You could take that exact
same energy

26:09.702 --> 26:13.771
And change yourself,
this neighborhood, this city.

26:15.274 --> 26:18.042
That's cute.
That's real cute.

26:18.044 --> 26:19.076
Whatever.

26:19.078 --> 26:20.344
Be a murderer.

26:20.346 --> 26:21.979
You live with that.

26:21.981 --> 26:23.847
[gun cocking]

26:23.849 --> 26:25.883
No problem.

26:26.986 --> 26:28.652
[door slams]

26:29.589 --> 26:31.622
What the hell are you doing?

26:31.624 --> 26:33.324
I told you to let
this fool die.

26:33.326 --> 26:35.192
And i told you
he was my cousin.

26:35.194 --> 26:36.360
He said my name.

26:36.362 --> 26:38.629
Big deal, orion.

26:38.631 --> 26:44.168
Now i said it too,
orion samson from inglewood.

26:44.170 --> 26:47.004
You gonna shoot me now?

26:47.006 --> 26:49.373
Maybe.

26:53.613 --> 26:56.046
Step away from there
and put that fool gun down.

27:02.221 --> 27:04.722
You--you, get over here.

27:07.093 --> 27:09.660
I got some extra stuff
just in case. Here.

27:09.662 --> 27:10.928
- Okay.
- Is that a juice box?

27:10.930 --> 27:12.062
- Yeah.
- Throw me that.

27:12.064 --> 27:15.199
- Yeah, good.
- Okay, this is what i have.

27:15.201 --> 27:18.302
- Open that wire.
- The wire--

27:18.304 --> 27:19.737
(roman)
and you're gonna need
a knife.

27:19.739 --> 27:21.005
Okay.

27:24.243 --> 27:28.779
Give her that straw.

27:31.117 --> 27:32.349
[gasping]

27:32.351 --> 27:33.984
- Burgess.
- Yeah?

27:33.986 --> 27:36.387
Run the wire
through the straw.

27:36.389 --> 27:38.922
- Okay.
- Until it just pokes out, okay?

27:38.924 --> 27:40.290
Okay.

27:40.292 --> 27:42.126
This is gonna take
a little bit of feel,

27:42.128 --> 27:43.794
And you can't be squeamish.

27:43.796 --> 27:45.763
I can do it.

27:45.765 --> 27:48.666
I know you can.

27:48.668 --> 27:53.404
Now, take your fingers
and find his clavicle,

27:53.406 --> 27:56.306
Or collarbone,
or whatever it's called.

27:56.308 --> 28:00.678
Right there, yeah.
Find the middle of his bone.

28:00.680 --> 28:03.047
Now, you move your fingers down
his chest, feeling each bone.

28:03.049 --> 28:06.784
Okay. Here.

28:06.786 --> 28:08.318
Count out until you
find the third one.

28:08.320 --> 28:11.255
One, two, three.

28:11.257 --> 28:13.991
Hey, how do you know
how to do this?

28:13.993 --> 28:16.393
I pay attention
when the paramedics show up.

28:16.395 --> 28:18.128
- What the hell do you do?
- I don't know.

28:18.130 --> 28:19.329
I guess i'm--i don't know.

28:19.331 --> 28:23.067
Forget it. Just focus on this.

28:23.069 --> 28:28.238
Now, take the knife and make
an incision right in that spot,

28:28.240 --> 28:33.310
Then you're gonna plunge
the wire and the straw

28:33.312 --> 28:35.379
All the way into his lung.

28:35.381 --> 28:40.484
Slide out the wire,
and you'll leave the straw.

28:40.486 --> 28:43.187
Hey, look at me.

28:43.189 --> 28:45.055
You can do this.

28:48.160 --> 28:51.428
Okay, okay, here goes.

28:51.430 --> 28:53.430
- Come on.
- Here goes.

28:53.432 --> 28:56.467
[groaning]

29:03.209 --> 29:04.274
Ugh.

29:17.356 --> 29:20.224
[clapping]
whoo!

29:20.226 --> 29:21.825
Nice.

29:21.827 --> 29:23.260
[chuckling]

29:23.262 --> 29:24.962
Okay.

29:27.533 --> 29:29.933
Now, if one of you will dial
911, we can finally get--

29:29.935 --> 29:30.934
[gunshot]

29:37.276 --> 29:38.776
What did you do that for?

29:38.778 --> 29:41.945
He said my name,
just like you did.

29:41.947 --> 29:43.480
[gunshot]

29:44.984 --> 29:46.183
[gunshot]

29:52.458 --> 29:53.774

29:53.775 --> 29:55.091
(orion)
hey, hey, huh?

29:55.094 --> 29:58.362
Come on, now.

29:58.364 --> 29:59.429
Where you at?

30:01.200 --> 30:03.967
Where you at?

30:03.969 --> 30:05.869
Huh?

30:12.244 --> 30:14.411
Almost all of them, huh?

30:14.413 --> 30:16.446
Real charming group
you got up there.

30:16.448 --> 30:18.048
Tell me about it.

30:18.050 --> 30:20.083
You still got
that drug testing business?

30:20.085 --> 30:23.854
I got a lot of things.

30:23.856 --> 30:27.491
Pleasure doing business
with you.

30:27.493 --> 30:33.130
Say, you ever want to grab
a drink, roll a few frames--

30:33.132 --> 30:34.998
- Not my type.
- Oh.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.066
You got to call me back,
'cause you're starting

30:36.068 --> 30:38.268
To freak me out.

30:38.270 --> 30:39.970
Sarge, have you seen burgess?

30:39.972 --> 30:40.971
In the past, yes.

30:40.973 --> 30:46.343
In the present, no.

30:46.345 --> 30:48.111
2101?

30:48.113 --> 30:49.246
(male dispatcher)
go, 21 desk.

30:49.248 --> 30:52.416
Can i get a mobile with 2114?

30:52.418 --> 30:54.551
(dispatcher)
last we have is
them down on a personal.

30:54.553 --> 30:59.256
We'll get you a location.

30:59.258 --> 31:01.124
Could be just like
a summer retreat.

31:01.126 --> 31:02.893
Wouldn't have to live there.

31:02.895 --> 31:04.027
Wisconsin again?

31:04.029 --> 31:06.930
Actual bald eagles
flying around.

31:06.932 --> 31:09.499
The smell of cheese curds
doesn't scare them away.

31:09.501 --> 31:14.304
I'm just saying,
it's a nice thought.

31:14.306 --> 31:19.309
And yeah, i meant you and me.

31:19.311 --> 31:21.111
That is a nice thought.

31:21.113 --> 31:24.147
[footsteps approaching]

31:25.985 --> 31:27.050
Adam, hey.

31:32.157 --> 31:36.927
Everything okay?

31:36.929 --> 31:38.629
No, i don't think it is.

31:42.601 --> 31:44.101
- Boss.
- Yeah?

31:44.103 --> 31:46.637
You mind if i take off early
today?

31:46.639 --> 31:48.372
What's up?

31:48.374 --> 31:49.373
I got a bad feeling
about burgess.

31:49.375 --> 31:52.209
Nobody can find her or roman.

31:52.211 --> 31:54.945
I just--i want to go check
their last known.

31:54.947 --> 31:56.380
Let's go--grab the whole team.

31:56.382 --> 31:57.481
Thank you, sarge.

32:02.922 --> 32:04.621
Get up.

32:06.425 --> 32:07.991
Oh, come on!

32:10.195 --> 32:12.362
Wait, you can go.

32:12.364 --> 32:13.397
What? No, forget it.

32:13.399 --> 32:15.232
Burgess, go out that window
and get some help.

32:15.234 --> 32:16.500
Hey, i'm not leaving you,
okay?

32:16.502 --> 32:18.335
Burgess, you want to die
with me,

32:18.337 --> 32:20.504
Or do you want to live and bring
these guys to justice?

32:20.506 --> 32:21.922
'cause i vote for plan
number two.

32:21.923 --> 32:23.339
Now, go.

32:23.342 --> 32:24.508
He's gonna kill you--

32:24.509 --> 32:25.675
- I'm not gonna ask you again.
- Roman--

32:25.678 --> 32:28.178
Go.

32:45.531 --> 32:47.264
So that's what you're doing.

32:47.266 --> 32:49.132
You gonna make
me chase after you, huh?

32:57.042 --> 32:58.108
All right.

33:18.597 --> 33:20.130
Aah!

33:21.333 --> 33:23.633
- Burgess!
- Oh!

33:25.204 --> 33:26.269
Burgess!

33:32.077 --> 33:35.579
Burgess!

33:42.721 --> 33:43.620
Mm--oh.

33:43.621 --> 33:44.520
- Burgess!
- Oh, oh--

33:44.523 --> 33:45.555
Ah!

34:13.118 --> 34:15.185
Aah!

34:39.210 --> 34:42.344
Sorry.
I'm sorry, roman.

34:42.347 --> 34:45.215
I should've called for
backup.

34:45.217 --> 34:47.083
I shouldn't have marched
over here.

34:47.085 --> 34:51.288
I should've done
a million things different.

34:51.290 --> 34:54.591
Nah, you went on instinct.

34:54.592 --> 35:00.464
That's what patrolmen do.
You were right.

35:04.303 --> 35:05.719
You should've gone
out that window when i told you.

35:05.720 --> 35:07.136
And not have you to carry
around anymore?

35:07.139 --> 35:09.272
No, i made the right move.

35:19.551 --> 35:21.251
Can i tell you something?

35:21.253 --> 35:23.253
Oh, god, you're not gonna
tell me you're falling in love

35:23.255 --> 35:24.888
With me, are you?

35:24.890 --> 35:27.824
I'm a wounded man,
but that hurt.

35:27.826 --> 35:32.562
[laughs]
come on, buddy.

35:32.564 --> 35:36.399
Earlier, you said
you weren't doing anything

35:36.401 --> 35:41.204
To change your life,
well, you definitely did today.

35:43.175 --> 35:44.992
Shut up.

35:44.993 --> 35:46.810
No, i mean it.

35:46.812 --> 35:48.879
- Five years from now...
- Sorry.

35:48.881 --> 35:54.484
When you're a detective
in vice or major crimes,

35:54.486 --> 35:58.622
These days of you and me
patrolling--

35:58.624 --> 36:00.891
They'll be a permanent part
of you.

36:00.893 --> 36:02.626
All right,
i think that blow to your head

36:02.628 --> 36:04.628
Has you talking gibberish.

36:04.630 --> 36:05.829
Maybe.

36:07.766 --> 36:10.567
I'll live.

36:10.569 --> 36:11.601
[door slams shut]

36:19.511 --> 36:20.127
.

36:20.128 --> 36:20.744
Gun! Gun! Gun! Gun! Gun!

36:20.746 --> 36:22.279
Don't move!

36:29.388 --> 36:31.354
(officer)
police! Stop the vehicle!

36:35.894 --> 36:38.562
(lindsay)
put your hands where i can see
them. Out the window!

36:38.564 --> 36:39.863
- Out the window now.
- Kev!

36:39.865 --> 36:41.665
I got him.

36:45.704 --> 36:46.937
Burgess--kim?

36:46.939 --> 36:48.438
- Yes, yeah.
- You all right?

36:48.440 --> 36:49.940
I'm fine. I need you to get
sean an ambulance now.

36:49.942 --> 36:51.975
- There's one on the way.
- How did you find us?

36:51.977 --> 36:53.577
We found your car.
We heard gunshots.

36:53.579 --> 36:56.313
All right, i got them.
They're over here.

36:56.315 --> 36:57.881
Plus, i knew
you weren't missing lunch--

36:57.883 --> 36:59.649
Not without a good excuse,
right?

36:59.651 --> 37:01.952
- Yeah.
- Hey, you okay, man?

37:01.954 --> 37:03.353
You doing all right?

37:03.355 --> 37:05.956
You all right, man?

37:05.958 --> 37:07.958
She saved my life.

37:12.598 --> 37:14.431
(antonio)
all right, ambulance
is on its way.

37:14.433 --> 37:16.700
Looks pretty bad.
His scalp.

37:16.702 --> 37:17.701
It's pretty deep.

37:40.259 --> 37:42.892
Tell me i fell through
a wormhole, burgess,

37:44.496 --> 37:46.029
And was transported
to april fools,

37:46.030 --> 37:47.563
'cause i can't believe
what i'm hearing.

37:47.566 --> 37:49.566
What'd you hear?

37:49.568 --> 37:52.569
That you singlehandedly
saved your partner's life

37:52.571 --> 37:54.871
And took down
a smuggling operation.

37:54.873 --> 37:58.275
This has got
to be a joke, right?

37:58.277 --> 38:00.277
It must have been me hit
on the head instead of roman,

38:00.279 --> 38:02.612
And i'm in a coma or something.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.047
Commander fisher, here she is.

38:06.618 --> 38:07.684
Commander.

38:12.024 --> 38:14.524
Hell of a job, patrolman.

38:14.526 --> 38:17.294
You should be proud.

38:20.732 --> 38:23.800
[clapping]

38:43.388 --> 38:44.587
Hey.

38:48.927 --> 38:52.829
I was really worried
about you.

38:52.831 --> 38:54.864
I'm glad you were.

39:02.841 --> 39:05.342
So the asian guy in the van
said he was there before,

39:05.344 --> 39:07.677
But he heard a lady cop
say over the radio

39:07.679 --> 39:12.682
That the place
was full of uniforms.

39:12.684 --> 39:16.119
Yep, i think i said something
like that.

39:16.121 --> 39:17.120
That's pretty good.

39:17.122 --> 39:20.123
[chuckles]
thanks.

39:24.696 --> 39:27.797
When no one came out,
he figured he got played,

39:27.799 --> 39:32.869
So he went back for the goods.

39:32.871 --> 39:34.003
Oh, my god.

39:34.005 --> 39:37.006
[sobbing]

39:44.583 --> 39:48.818
Hey, you know what?

39:48.820 --> 39:53.490
You're incredible.

39:53.492 --> 39:54.524
It's okay.

40:08.073 --> 40:12.142
Oh, hey.

40:12.144 --> 40:13.843
Hey.

40:13.845 --> 40:15.145
Kim.

40:15.147 --> 40:16.546
Hey, kim.

40:16.548 --> 40:19.516
I'm patrick.

40:19.518 --> 40:22.619
So patrick,
what do you do besides,

40:22.621 --> 40:25.655
You know, guess
how much people's checks are?

40:25.657 --> 40:29.959
I'm--i'm in marketing.

40:29.961 --> 40:33.530
Oatmeal and orange juice?

40:33.532 --> 40:36.065
Actually, i'm gonna
have the banana

40:36.067 --> 40:39.202
And chocolate chip pancakes
with a side of bacon,

40:39.204 --> 40:41.771
A side of sausage, and a side
of one egg, scrambled,

40:41.773 --> 40:45.809
And extra chocolate chips.

40:45.811 --> 40:46.976
I'm mixing it up.

40:46.978 --> 40:49.212
I can see that.

40:49.214 --> 40:52.882
So what do you do, kim?

40:53.305 --> 40:59.531
