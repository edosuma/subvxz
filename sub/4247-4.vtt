WEBVTT

00:00.767 --> 00:04.303
You're sure it's safe to go
back to your apartment?

00:04.305 --> 00:07.172
Rowan knows where I am.
B613 always knows where I am.

00:07.174 --> 00:09.074
It doesn't matter where I go.
(breathes heavily)

00:09.076 --> 00:10.409
I'm not the one who wants me
to leave.

00:10.411 --> 00:12.077
Jake.

00:12.079 --> 00:14.079
You're safer if I'm here.

00:14.081 --> 00:16.115
You and I both know
I'm already being defended.

00:16.117 --> 00:17.750
By the president?

00:19.219 --> 00:22.488
Does he know
your father's command?

00:22.490 --> 00:25.024
Does he?

00:25.026 --> 00:26.525
No.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.360
So how can he defend you?
How can he defend you

00:28.362 --> 00:30.062
If he doesn't know
who your enemy is?

00:30.064 --> 00:32.364
My father wouldn't hurt me,
not physically.

00:32.366 --> 00:34.700
He put me in a hole,
which was bad.

00:34.702 --> 00:36.635
What was worse--
every other day

00:36.637 --> 00:38.504
He had two guys haul me
out of that hole,

00:38.506 --> 00:40.139
And he stood there
and watched

00:40.141 --> 00:41.507
As they beat the crap
out of me.

00:41.509 --> 00:44.176
They did things to me
that you can't imagine.

00:44.178 --> 00:46.045
And then he had me
bandaged up.

00:46.047 --> 00:47.379
Set the bones,
stitched the cuts,

00:47.381 --> 00:51.383
'cause he wanted me alive
and then back in the hole.

00:51.385 --> 00:52.818
That was just for fun.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.386
Olivia, he would hurt you.

00:54.388 --> 00:56.622
Your father?
He would slit your throat

00:56.624 --> 00:58.690
And drink your blood
if it served the republic,

00:58.692 --> 01:00.125
And I think you know that.

01:00.127 --> 01:01.827
I think you have nightmares
about that.

01:01.829 --> 01:03.729
So why are you pretending like
you're daddy's little girl?

01:03.731 --> 01:06.532
I can't. I can't have you here.
He can't know you're still here.
Liv--

01:06.534 --> 01:08.700
He made huck kill.
Just like that.

01:08.702 --> 01:11.070
He flipped his switch,
and huck is killing again.

01:11.072 --> 01:12.738
My father did that
just so I'd know he could.

01:12.740 --> 01:15.674
He's in charge.
He's in charge of everything.

01:15.676 --> 01:19.078
Which is why
we have to stop him.
No. I can't be involved!

01:19.080 --> 01:21.146
Whatever's going on,
I don't want to be a part of it.

01:21.148 --> 01:23.148
I don't want to know.
I don't want to see.

01:23.150 --> 01:24.416
I don't want to help.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.151
I need to go back to doing
what worked.

01:26.153 --> 01:28.520
Eyes straight ahead,
no looking around corners,

01:28.522 --> 01:30.389
No peeping in shadows,
no asking questions,

01:30.391 --> 01:31.723
No stepping outside
the lines.

01:31.725 --> 01:33.492
I need to be a good girl,
go to Sunday dinners.

01:33.494 --> 01:37.162
Liv--
I've never heard of b613.
I've never heard of you.

01:44.704 --> 01:46.371
(sniffs)

02:06.626 --> 02:09.495
(cell phone chiming)

02:09.497 --> 02:11.830
(chimes and beeps)

02:11.832 --> 02:14.333
Harrison.
We got the job.

02:14.335 --> 02:16.168
They said yes?
They said yes.

02:16.170 --> 02:17.803
(rick james' "mary jane"
playing)

02:17.805 --> 02:19.705
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

02:19.707 --> 02:21.406
Can I come up?

02:21.408 --> 02:24.343
(exhales) no.

02:24.345 --> 02:27.479
Okay. No.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.815
(sighs) I don't know. Ugh.
You don't know?

02:29.817 --> 02:31.617
I don't know.
Okay, I'm gonna go.

02:31.619 --> 02:33.819
Don't be mad.
I have a case to prep.

02:33.821 --> 02:38.190
The senator who murdered
the girl he was sexting.

02:38.192 --> 02:40.225
The family's like a deer in
the headlights with the media.

02:40.227 --> 02:42.227
(cell phone rings)
they're good people who could
really use some gladiating.

02:42.229 --> 02:43.462
(whispers) sorry.

02:43.464 --> 02:47.466
Electric bill's getting...
<i>Paid,</i> abby.

02:47.468 --> 02:49.234
Lights are staying on!

02:49.236 --> 02:50.569
(clears throat)
(cell phone beeps)

02:50.571 --> 02:52.371
Well... Good night.

02:52.373 --> 02:54.540
Good night?
Well, I was serious

02:54.542 --> 02:56.175
About the girl's family
and the gladiating.

02:56.177 --> 02:57.476
I'm sorry, david.

02:57.478 --> 03:00.145
But... We already have a gig.

03:00.147 --> 03:01.847
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

03:01.849 --> 03:04.216
My name is huck,
and I'm an alcoholic.

03:04.218 --> 03:05.384
Hello, huck.
Hi, huck.

03:05.386 --> 03:08.921
So, uh... I fell
off the wagon.

03:08.923 --> 03:11.690
I let my guard down,
and I...

03:11.692 --> 03:15.894
The sad thing is that
I was offered a bottle

03:15.896 --> 03:18.263
A month ago,
and I didn't take it.

03:18.265 --> 03:19.731
I was strong.

03:19.733 --> 03:22.367
But this time was different.

03:22.369 --> 03:25.204
This time I didn't take
the whiskey.

03:25.206 --> 03:28.874
It was put in my hand.

03:28.876 --> 03:33.245
The... Decision
was taken away from me.

03:33.247 --> 03:34.780
And I drank...

03:34.782 --> 03:35.981
¶

03:35.983 --> 03:37.883
And drank...

03:37.885 --> 03:41.486
And drank.

03:41.488 --> 03:43.655
I wish I could say
that I hated it,

03:43.657 --> 03:45.324
But I didn't.

03:45.326 --> 03:46.658
I liked it.

03:46.660 --> 03:49.628
Because whiskey is good.

03:49.630 --> 03:51.697
Whiskey feels like home.

03:51.699 --> 03:54.866
And I just...
(cell phone rings)

03:54.868 --> 03:56.902
(whispering) crap!
(ring)

03:56.904 --> 03:59.871
Crap, crap, crap!
(beep)

03:59.873 --> 04:01.240
¶

04:01.242 --> 04:02.641
(lowered voice) what?

04:02.643 --> 04:04.509
The money train's arrived.
I'll be right there.

04:04.511 --> 04:06.011
(clicks phone)

04:06.013 --> 04:09.514
¶ around

04:09.516 --> 04:12.618
¶ do you love me, mary jane?

04:12.620 --> 04:19.024
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

04:19.026 --> 04:21.627
(james) do it, cy.
Open your mouth.

04:21.629 --> 04:23.629
(cyrus laughs) get that thing
away from me.

04:23.631 --> 04:25.430
Open your mouth, cy,
and give it to me.

04:25.432 --> 04:28.000
I know you want to.
(laughs) stop it!

04:28.002 --> 04:31.370
One quote, cy. One tiny quote
I can take back to my editor.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.838
I am not going to comment...

04:32.840 --> 04:34.673
On the personal life
of a senator.
(recorder beeps)

04:34.675 --> 04:36.008
The personal life
of a senator?

04:36.010 --> 04:37.876
He took a picture
of his wang

04:37.878 --> 04:39.344
And killed the woman
he sent it to.

04:39.346 --> 04:40.879
This in a party that already

04:40.881 --> 04:42.514
Has a wang problem
because of your boss.

04:42.516 --> 04:43.982
So don't sit there and act
like this murder trial

04:43.984 --> 04:45.050
Has nothing to do with you.

04:45.052 --> 04:46.852
It has everything
to do with you.

04:46.854 --> 04:48.654
Which is why you're going
to put this memo down

04:48.656 --> 04:51.023
And give me a quote
from the white house,

04:51.025 --> 04:53.358
Who has yet to respond
to repeated allegations

04:53.360 --> 04:57.362
Is suffering through its worst
p.R. Crisis in years.

04:57.364 --> 04:58.664
(beeps)
(imitates snoring)

04:58.666 --> 05:00.999
(sighs) one sentence, cy,

05:01.001 --> 05:02.701
And I promise I will
leave you alone.

05:02.703 --> 05:05.704
(scoffs)
(beeps)

05:05.706 --> 05:07.072
(exhales)

05:07.074 --> 05:09.041
No comment.

05:09.043 --> 05:10.809
Ugh! Bitch.
(chuckles)

05:10.811 --> 05:12.678
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

05:12.680 --> 05:14.746
Senator richard meyers--
by day, he represents

05:14.748 --> 05:15.981
The great state of washington

05:15.983 --> 05:17.783
In our nation's
highest legislative body.

05:17.785 --> 05:20.986
By night, he is a perving,
sexting pervy-perv

05:20.988 --> 05:23.989
Who uses the handle
"redwood johnson."

05:23.991 --> 05:25.991
Gross.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.726
Say the thing again.
We need the money.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.394
We need the money.
We need the money.

05:29.396 --> 05:31.396
We need the money.
Right. Okay.
We need the money.

05:31.398 --> 05:34.066
We've had worse clients...
I think.

05:34.068 --> 05:35.734
Haven't we?

05:35.736 --> 05:37.402
Pics of his junk
aren't the problem.

05:37.404 --> 05:39.504
It's the welcome recipient--
a miss desiree oaks.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.473
She saved them all, tried to use
them to blackmail the senator

05:41.475 --> 05:43.375
And ended up murdered.
(quinn) bludgeoned to death.

05:43.377 --> 05:45.777
The weapon was never recovered,
but the senator's prints

05:45.779 --> 05:47.379
Were found all over
desiree's apartment.

05:47.381 --> 05:49.114
What were you doing
at her apartment, senator?

05:49.116 --> 05:52.718
Try and get some those photos
back, resolve this mess.

05:52.720 --> 05:56.588
But I did not so much as lay
one finger on that girl.

05:56.590 --> 05:57.989
Were there any other women
you engaged

05:57.991 --> 06:01.993
No, it was just one stupid
little trifle. That's it.

06:01.995 --> 06:03.929
And as the record shows, he was
home at the time of the murder.

06:03.931 --> 06:06.765
And you'd be the one to testify
to that, mrs. Meyers?

06:06.767 --> 06:08.900
Yes. Absolutely.

06:08.902 --> 06:11.403
(abby) shelley meyers,
the senator's alibi.

06:11.405 --> 06:13.071
She's a doting mother,
partner at a law firm,

06:13.073 --> 06:15.941
All-around upstanding citizen.
If she's still supporting him

06:15.943 --> 06:18.076
After everything
he's put her through...
He must not be guilty.

06:18.078 --> 06:19.945
That's the message
we're sending.

06:19.947 --> 06:22.447
Jury always reads and watches
news stories about the trial,

06:22.449 --> 06:24.683
Despite orders by the judge
to the contrary.

06:24.685 --> 06:26.017
So while I argue your case,

06:26.019 --> 06:27.786
Olivia's gonna work
on your perception,

06:27.788 --> 06:29.154
Both in the courtroom
and in the media.

06:29.156 --> 06:30.889
Well, I appreciate that,
miss pope.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.557
I'm about to mount
a re-election campaign,

06:32.559 --> 06:33.992
And I'm bleeding
approval ratings.

06:33.994 --> 06:35.560
We'll do what we can,
senator.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.062
Thanks very much, liv.
Yeah.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.898
Your daughter?
Uh, she's in bethesda
with my sister.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.600
I thought it best to keep her
as far away

06:41.602 --> 06:45.036
Luckily, she has a history
report to keep her busy.

06:45.038 --> 06:47.539
Elizabeth cady stanton.
Oh, worthy subject.

06:47.541 --> 06:48.940
Mm.

06:48.942 --> 06:51.777
Um... Look, um...

06:51.779 --> 06:54.913
(door closes)
I know you think
my husband--

06:54.915 --> 06:57.048
That what he did
was creepy, and it was.

06:57.050 --> 06:58.483
There's no doubt about it.

06:58.485 --> 06:59.718
But the man who sent
those pictures--

06:59.720 --> 07:01.019
That was
a different richard.

07:01.021 --> 07:03.054
And we have been through
marriage counseling,

07:03.056 --> 07:04.656
We've talked endlessly,

07:04.658 --> 07:06.458
And he's
a better person now.

07:06.460 --> 07:09.161
And, in case
you've forgotten, innocent.

07:09.163 --> 07:11.763
So I won't let the world hang
him for something he didn't do.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.698
You of all people should
know how wrong that is.

07:13.700 --> 07:15.667
He made one mistake,
miss pope.

07:15.669 --> 07:17.903
One. And...

07:17.905 --> 07:19.571
We all deserve
a second chance.

07:19.573 --> 07:21.573
Exactly.

07:25.011 --> 07:26.945
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

07:26.947 --> 07:28.747
(reporters shouting questions
at once)

07:28.749 --> 07:31.016
(man) is it true that
the senator is a sex addict?

07:31.018 --> 07:33.618
With miss oaks
before you killed her?

07:33.620 --> 07:35.587
Senator, are you and mrs. Meyers
getting a divorce?

07:35.589 --> 07:38.490
We're very sad about what
happened to desiree oaks,

07:38.492 --> 07:40.225
But my client
isn't a murderer.

07:40.227 --> 07:41.726
He didn't kill miss oaks.

07:41.728 --> 07:43.995
The only thing he's guilty of
is bad judgment.

07:43.997 --> 07:46.465
He texted a girl--
one girl.

07:46.467 --> 07:47.999
He made one mistake.

07:48.001 --> 07:49.501
(reporters resume
shouting questions)

07:49.503 --> 07:51.002
And, kelly, can you read
the text messages

07:51.004 --> 07:54.539
You received from the defendant
to the court, please?

07:54.541 --> 07:56.541
"I thought about you
so many times today.

07:56.543 --> 07:59.911
I want to shave you,
put you on my lap..."
(gallery murmuring)

07:59.913 --> 08:01.480
"make you my little..."
butterfly.

08:01.482 --> 08:03.014
That's what he used to
call me.

08:03.016 --> 08:04.783
"spread your wings, butterfly.

08:04.785 --> 08:05.917
Spread 'em wide
and tell me how..."

08:05.919 --> 08:07.219
"I can be your daddy.

08:07.221 --> 08:08.753
You wanna feel my paddle,
baby girl?"

08:08.755 --> 08:10.121
"just beat me up.
Make me your..."

08:10.123 --> 08:11.756
"toilet."

08:11.758 --> 08:15.160
He wanted to take pictures of me
on the toilet.

08:15.162 --> 08:18.763
"squeeze 'em until they
hit you in the face."

08:18.765 --> 08:21.766
I don't even know
what that means.

08:21.768 --> 08:24.035
No further questions.

08:24.037 --> 08:25.804
It still doesn't mean
he murdered her.

08:25.806 --> 08:27.005
Tell that to the jury.

08:33.647 --> 08:38.016
<i>On the issues of</i>
<i>last night's democratic debate,</i>

08:38.018 --> 08:39.784
<i>The best moment of the night</i>
<i>belonged to</i>

08:39.786 --> 08:41.653
<i>Congresswoman</i>
<i>josephine marcus of montana.</i>

08:41.655 --> 08:43.221
<i>I don't think it is a matter</i>
<i>of the president</i>

08:43.223 --> 08:45.624
<i>Showing leadership</i>
<i>on the issue.</i>

08:45.626 --> 08:47.158
<i>At this point,</i>
<i>I'm more interested</i>

08:47.160 --> 08:49.027
<i>In him not showing</i>
<i>certain things.</i>

08:49.029 --> 08:51.796
<i>I think it's high time</i>
<i>the man tame his cobra</i>

08:51.798 --> 08:53.198
<i>And keep the lid</i>
<i>on the basket</i>

08:53.200 --> 08:56.034
<i>So our country can focus</i>
<i>on education,</i>

08:56.036 --> 08:59.271
<i>Keeping jobs here at home.</i>
<i>I mean, honestly...</i>

08:59.273 --> 09:01.606
Are you watching this hack?

09:01.608 --> 09:05.944
It's good. Catchy.
Good? I don't know
who's hurting us more,

09:05.946 --> 09:08.780
The pervert or this one.
Let the dems take
all the free shots they want

09:08.782 --> 09:10.181
Now during the primary.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.083
That way, if they try
these jokes in the election,

09:12.085 --> 09:15.253
Well, regardless, we need
to keep fitz above the fray.

09:15.255 --> 09:17.289
Focus on national security,
pick a fight with russia,

09:17.291 --> 09:19.624
Something.
(cyrus) g8 summit's coming up.

09:19.626 --> 09:20.859
(mellie) g8. No one
pays attention to the g8.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.294
Half of america can't even
spell g8.

09:22.296 --> 09:25.630
No. We need a war. We need
to liberate some people.

09:25.632 --> 09:27.732
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

09:27.734 --> 09:29.067
You can't take the stand
right now.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.635
David rosen will rip you
to shreds.

09:30.637 --> 09:31.670
He's made this case
all about you, senator--

09:31.672 --> 09:33.071
Your failings, your flaws,

09:33.073 --> 09:36.041
How someone like you could have
murdered desiree oaks.

09:36.043 --> 09:37.576
Is this still going on?

09:37.578 --> 09:41.813
This all happened
before I was arrested.
So what do we do now?

09:41.815 --> 09:45.817
We need to find other reasons
she might have been killed.

09:47.019 --> 09:49.588
(exhales)

09:49.590 --> 09:52.757
You had other women.
Maybe she had other men.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.359
Are we really going to...

09:54.361 --> 09:57.329
Slut-shame a dead girl?
All aboard.

09:57.331 --> 09:59.030
(david) mr. Granville,

09:59.032 --> 10:01.333
Would you please describe your
relationship with the victim?

10:01.335 --> 10:03.668
Like a mentor.
She would come to me

10:03.670 --> 10:05.337
With work questions,
problems,

10:05.339 --> 10:08.873
Did she ever mention
the defendant, senator meyers?

10:08.875 --> 10:11.276
She said she received
threatening texts from him.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.744
And when did she
tell you this?

10:12.746 --> 10:16.281
We were at dinner,
and she said that she was

10:16.283 --> 10:18.817
Afraid for her life,

10:18.819 --> 10:21.720
That senator meyers had told her
he would kill her.

10:22.955 --> 10:24.122
Your witness.

10:24.124 --> 10:28.226
Mr. Granville,
would you say that

10:28.228 --> 10:30.061
You and desiree
had dinner together often?

10:30.063 --> 10:32.230
No more than any mentor
occasionally checking in

10:32.232 --> 10:33.665
On his protégée.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.266
So once a week,
according to these receipts?

10:35.268 --> 10:37.302
I suppose.

10:37.304 --> 10:38.837
And at these dinners
with your protégée,

10:38.839 --> 10:41.806
Did you present her with gifts
of high-end jewelry,

10:41.808 --> 10:43.675
Handbags, and at one time,

10:43.677 --> 10:45.744
A blackglama mink jacket,

10:45.746 --> 10:47.145
Which your waitress said,
and I quote,

10:47.147 --> 10:48.780
"I would kill
my own mother for"?

10:48.782 --> 10:51.716
Well, you're quote a mentor,
mr. Granville.

10:51.718 --> 10:53.385
Maybe a better term
would be "sugar daddy."

10:53.387 --> 10:56.655
Coming to light
in the senator meyers scandal

10:56.657 --> 10:59.691
Had multiple suitors
supporting her lavish lifestyle.

10:59.693 --> 11:01.226
Objection.

11:01.228 --> 11:03.094
Rent.
Objection.

11:03.096 --> 11:05.030
Car payments.
Objection!

11:05.032 --> 11:07.699
Even her gym membership
was paid for by...

11:07.701 --> 11:10.001
Men who enjoy supporting
a young woman financially

11:10.003 --> 11:11.403
In exchange
for her company.

11:11.405 --> 11:13.905
But isn't that essentially
prostitution by another name?

11:13.907 --> 11:17.042
I think it's fair to say there's
more than one man out there

11:17.044 --> 11:18.376
Who could have been
jealous enough

11:18.378 --> 11:19.744
To commit
the crime of passion

11:19.746 --> 11:21.413
That sadly ended
desiree oaks' life.

11:21.415 --> 11:22.781
I object to all of this!

11:22.783 --> 11:27.152
Mr. Rosen, on what grounds?

11:30.923 --> 11:32.457
(camera shutters clicking)
and congresswoman dandridge
has assured me

11:32.459 --> 11:33.725
That she's going to push
her colleagues

11:33.727 --> 11:35.160
To follow her example

11:35.162 --> 11:37.762
So that facilities such as
the adams irving medical center

11:37.764 --> 11:40.198
Become the rule in this country
and not the exception.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.333
Thank you, samantha.

11:42.335 --> 11:44.335
And thanks, everyone.

11:44.337 --> 11:45.704
Thank you.

11:45.706 --> 11:47.739
Yeah. (chuckles)
this way?

11:47.741 --> 11:48.840
(projector and camera shutter
click)

11:48.842 --> 11:54.212
I think it's great anytime a new
female talent enters politics.

11:54.214 --> 11:55.313
Even if she's a democrat?

11:55.315 --> 11:57.282
Doesn't matter what party
you're from.

11:57.284 --> 11:59.718
All of us women have to break
through the same glass ceiling.
(laughter)

11:59.720 --> 12:03.154
Give any piece of trailer trash
a push-up bra and a microphone,

12:03.156 --> 12:06.491
And those stupid flyovers will
eat it up like fried twinkies--
mellie...

12:06.493 --> 12:08.159
My mic's still on.

12:08.161 --> 12:09.961
(projector and camera shutter
click)

12:12.898 --> 12:14.065
(gasps)

12:14.067 --> 12:16.201
(projector and camera shutter
click)

12:16.203 --> 12:18.002
<i>Our daughter was</i>
<i>a kind, generous person.</i>

12:18.004 --> 12:21.206
<i>Every day she made us proud</i>
<i>to be her parents.</i>

12:21.208 --> 12:23.341
<i>She's dead. The things</i>
<i>these people are saying--</i>

12:23.343 --> 12:25.276
<i>They should be ashamed.</i>
<i>Turn it off.</i>

12:25.278 --> 12:28.046
Tomorrow's all about
prepping the senator's wife.

12:28.048 --> 12:29.214
This entire case hangs

12:29.216 --> 12:32.884
I don't want any surprises
up on the stand.
We're on it.

12:42.862 --> 12:44.028
Huck.

12:45.798 --> 12:48.199
I was worried about you, okay?

12:48.201 --> 12:49.834
Why?
What?

12:49.836 --> 12:52.804
Why are you worried about me?
I come to work. I do my job.

12:52.806 --> 12:55.774
I go home. I have appropriate
emotional responses,

12:55.776 --> 12:58.109
And I'm taking social cues
for behavior.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.745
I am being normal.
Why are you worried?

13:00.747 --> 13:01.813
You're not...

13:01.815 --> 13:03.782
You're not talking to me,

13:03.784 --> 13:05.784
Not like you used to.
We're not...

13:05.786 --> 13:09.554
Look, I wanted to know
what was up.
So you followed me.

13:09.556 --> 13:12.157
Yeah.
Friends don't follow friends.

13:12.159 --> 13:13.992
I'm not a client, quinn.
You don't fix me.

13:13.994 --> 13:16.194
But those meetings do?
Those meetings are
supposed to be anonymous.

13:16.196 --> 13:18.263
They're also supposed to be
for alcoholics.

13:18.265 --> 13:20.865
Well... (sighs) huck, wait.
Who did you--

13:20.867 --> 13:22.834
You said you drank
the whiskey.

13:24.236 --> 13:26.571
That's a person, right?

13:26.573 --> 13:29.507
You killed someone
and it felt good?

13:29.509 --> 13:31.276
Like a high?

13:43.155 --> 13:44.589
(guns clink)

13:44.591 --> 13:46.524
What do you want?
To talk.

13:50.029 --> 13:52.030
What do you want?
To talk.

13:52.032 --> 13:54.332
I don't know what
you're talking about.

13:54.334 --> 13:58.536
I think you wanna take him out
as much as I do.

13:58.538 --> 14:01.039
(cocks gun)
we're both wearing leashes,
huck.

14:01.041 --> 14:03.541
You and me and everyone else
who's ever worked for that man--

14:03.543 --> 14:07.979
He owns us,
just like he owns liv.

14:07.981 --> 14:09.314
But if we could get
something on him--

14:09.316 --> 14:11.883
Something big like
murdering a guy--
no.

14:11.885 --> 14:13.985
Why?
Because no one takes down
command.

14:13.987 --> 14:15.887
No one's ever tried.
Stay away from liv.

14:15.889 --> 14:18.223
Stay away from me.

14:18.225 --> 14:20.091
(gun clicks)

14:24.496 --> 14:26.097
"worst lady"!

14:26.099 --> 14:28.366
(newspaper rustling)
"first catty bares claws"!

14:28.368 --> 14:29.634
"mouthy mellie"--

14:29.636 --> 14:31.169
"first catty"?
That doesn't even rhyme.

14:31.171 --> 14:32.203
What's the second rule
of politics?

14:32.205 --> 14:34.239
I know the damn rules.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.875
The same rule applies
to gun ownership.

14:36.877 --> 14:38.309
The microphone
is always loaded!

14:38.311 --> 14:39.944
I know the rules.
I took my mic off.

14:39.946 --> 14:41.579
Blame that
stupid congresswoman.
I'd like to,

14:41.581 --> 14:43.214
But then you had to go
and break rule number one--

14:43.216 --> 14:45.183
Never insult the voters.

14:45.185 --> 14:47.318
It'll blow over.
I will make it right.

14:47.320 --> 14:51.222
Josephine marcus went
from flavor of the month

14:51.224 --> 14:53.391
To legitimate
presidential candidate.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.193
You did that.
<i>You</i> gave her legitimacy.

14:55.195 --> 14:57.295
You minted her ass!

14:57.297 --> 14:58.897
Even better.
She's inexperienced.

14:58.899 --> 15:01.966
So that we can crush her
in the general.

15:01.968 --> 15:03.534
Ethan?

15:03.536 --> 15:05.169
Get in here!

15:07.274 --> 15:10.108
Would you say we had a problem
with female voters

15:10.110 --> 15:13.978
Yes, sir.
What if we ran
against a female candidate?

15:13.980 --> 15:15.146
Would that be fun for us?

15:15.148 --> 15:16.581
We'd likely get
clobbered, sir.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.116
I will go craft an apology.

15:18.118 --> 15:19.951
Run it by me first.

15:19.953 --> 15:22.587
The prosecution's about to rest.
Now it's our turn.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.956
Your testimony is crucial.
You nail it, we're home free.

15:24.958 --> 15:27.158
Just remember--
supportive, not smug.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.360
I know.
And make just enough eye contact
with the jury.

15:29.362 --> 15:31.095
Too little,
you'll seem impersonal.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.997
Too much,
you'll seem like you're begging.
I appreciate it, shel.

15:32.999 --> 15:36.100
(lowered voice) I have the head
of b.N.C. On the phone.

15:36.102 --> 15:37.568
Tell him I'll call him back.
He said it's urgent.

15:37.570 --> 15:39.537
Something about a story
that's about to break.

15:39.539 --> 15:41.506
He says he wants a comment.
What story?

15:41.508 --> 15:43.441
<i>We met on mixr last week.</i>
<i>It's an app.</i>

15:43.443 --> 15:45.376
<i>People pretend to use it</i>
<i>for networking,</i>

15:45.378 --> 15:47.578
<i>But it's really just</i>
<i>a hookup site.</i>

15:47.580 --> 15:51.182
<i>You know, he has a mole</i>
<i>on his--I mean, it's small,</i>

15:51.184 --> 15:54.152
<i>Anyway, I thought</i>
<i>he was harmless.</i>

15:54.154 --> 16:02.260
<i>I get a text, and it's like...</i>
<i>Whoa! Now I get the name.</i>

16:02.262 --> 16:06.264
She's lying. I've never seen
that girl in my life.

16:06.266 --> 16:08.166
Shelley, you have to
believe me.

16:08.168 --> 16:09.334
Call them up.

16:09.336 --> 16:11.202
Tell them it wasn't me.
Make a statement.

16:11.204 --> 16:13.204
Whatever you have to do.
I did not send that text.

16:13.206 --> 16:15.206
Did you hear what I said?
Harrison.

16:15.208 --> 16:16.541
Give me your phone.
What?

16:16.543 --> 16:20.011
You heard him.
I don't--I left my phone
in the car.

16:20.013 --> 16:22.347
(chuckles)
okay. Me and you,
men's room, now.

16:22.349 --> 16:25.216
You drop trou, and we hope
to god there's no mole.
There's a mole.

16:25.218 --> 16:28.319
(sighs)

16:30.222 --> 16:32.490
I don't know why I...

16:32.492 --> 16:34.325
I have a lot of stress.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.461
I couldn't sleep.

16:36.463 --> 16:39.063
I have a problem, shelley.

16:39.065 --> 16:40.198
Oh, shelley--

16:40.200 --> 16:41.499
Do not touch me.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.501
Not now. Not...

16:43.503 --> 16:47.405
(lowered voice)
don't touch me.

16:48.440 --> 16:50.641
(door opens)

16:50.643 --> 16:52.410
(projector and camera shutter
click)

16:52.412 --> 16:54.645
Honorable discharge
from the navy in '94.

16:54.647 --> 16:58.016
That was the last good thing
to happen to him.

16:58.018 --> 17:01.586
Small airline in florida.
He was fired six months in.

17:01.588 --> 17:04.789
Two marriages.
And a lot of arrests for
drunk and disorderly conduct.

17:04.791 --> 17:09.127
But even those dried up. I'm not
sure how he got by financially.

17:09.129 --> 17:12.163
But she doesn't seem to have
any more money than he did.

17:12.165 --> 17:13.464
What about
the funeral arrangements?

17:13.466 --> 17:15.133
Wherever his sister can find
the cheapest place

17:15.135 --> 17:17.201
To bury a pine box.

17:19.238 --> 17:22.306
(projector and camera shutter
click)

17:31.417 --> 17:33.384
(man) detail, halt!

17:36.455 --> 17:41.159
I never expected all this--
all this pomp and fuss.

17:41.161 --> 17:43.394
(car doors close)

17:44.596 --> 17:47.098
I'm sorry. Can I help you folks?
This is a private service.

17:47.100 --> 17:49.734
Ma'am...

17:49.736 --> 17:52.370
You must be
officer foster's sister.

17:52.372 --> 17:53.771
Marion, is it?

17:53.773 --> 17:55.339
Mr. President?

17:55.341 --> 17:58.309
And tell you
how sorry I am for your loss.

17:58.311 --> 18:00.378
I don't...
Mr. President--

18:00.380 --> 18:01.779
I never met your brother,

18:01.781 --> 18:05.516
But I was in the navy
at the same time.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.351
He was a good man.

18:07.353 --> 18:10.254
I didn't even think he could be
buried here at arlington,

18:10.256 --> 18:15.259
But then veterans affairs
called this morning, and...

18:15.261 --> 18:16.360
Was that you?

18:16.362 --> 18:17.762
Did you do this
for my brother?

18:17.764 --> 18:19.764
They let me pull a few strings
from time to time.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.132
Perk of the job.

18:21.134 --> 18:24.235
But why?

18:24.237 --> 18:26.370
(nina simone's
"wild is the wind" playing)

18:26.372 --> 18:28.406
Pete foster was
an american hero,

18:28.408 --> 18:31.142
And he deserves
to be buried as such.

18:31.144 --> 18:33.678
(man) detail, atten-hut!

18:33.680 --> 18:35.613
Half right... Face!

18:35.615 --> 18:39.484
¶ love me, love me, love me

18:39.486 --> 18:41.552
¶ say you do

18:41.554 --> 18:43.387
Aim! Fire!

18:43.389 --> 18:44.489
(gunshots)

18:44.491 --> 18:45.790
Aim.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.391
Fire.

18:47.393 --> 18:48.893
Aim. Fire.

18:48.895 --> 18:53.698
¶ let me fly away

18:53.700 --> 18:56.434
¶ with you

18:58.504 --> 19:05.543
¶ for my love
is like the wind ¶

19:05.545 --> 19:12.783
¶ and wild is the wind

19:17.856 --> 19:22.593
¶ give me more

19:22.595 --> 19:29.500
¶ than one caress

19:29.502 --> 19:39.877
¶ satisfy this hungriness

19:39.879 --> 19:43.581
¶ let the wind

19:43.583 --> 19:49.754
¶ blow through your heart

19:49.756 --> 19:56.227
¶ for wild is the wind

19:59.831 --> 20:01.599
(sighs)

20:01.601 --> 20:03.434
Are you an idiot, or did
you do it to spite me?

20:03.436 --> 20:05.303
What the hell are you
talking about?

20:05.305 --> 20:08.272
This. The president throws
a funeral

20:08.274 --> 20:09.574
For a down-on-his-luck navy vet,

20:09.576 --> 20:12.743
From the gravedigger's
instagram account?

20:12.745 --> 20:14.579
Me! The chief of staff's
husband,

20:14.581 --> 20:18.382
I could have produced a segment
on the president's heart

20:18.384 --> 20:20.751
At a time when the only organ
people care about is his penis.

20:20.753 --> 20:22.753
But, no, either you didn't
see the potential,

20:22.755 --> 20:24.555
Or--or you didn't see
<i>my</i> potential.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.791
So I ask you again--
are you an idiot,

20:26.793 --> 20:28.559
Or did you do it
to spite me?

20:28.561 --> 20:30.595
James, I had no idea
this was happening.

20:30.597 --> 20:32.930
Really? So the president
calls veterans affairs and says,

20:32.932 --> 20:34.765
"pete foster.
Let's throw him a funeral,"

20:34.767 --> 20:36.968
And no one said a word
to you?
No.

20:36.970 --> 20:38.836
Not everything I do
is a scheme.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.605
You may not believe that,
but it's true.

20:41.640 --> 20:43.674
Okay.
I'm sorry I bothered you.

20:43.676 --> 20:45.910
Wait.

20:45.912 --> 20:48.246
Did you say pete foster?

20:48.248 --> 20:51.315
(indistinct conversations,
children shouting playfully)

20:53.752 --> 20:56.854
You could have given me
a heads-up.
Not exactly my style.

20:56.856 --> 20:59.390
Or, okay, I don't know,
you could have not killed him.

20:59.392 --> 21:02.526
Calm down, cyrus.
Pete foster killed pete foster.

21:02.528 --> 21:04.629
Right, of course. Well,
whatever the official story is,

21:04.631 --> 21:06.597
The president heard about it,
because he went...

21:06.599 --> 21:10.368
<i>He practically arranged</i>
<i>the damn flowers himself.</i>

21:10.370 --> 21:11.769
<i>(rowan) pete foster had</i>
<i>every intention--</i>

21:11.771 --> 21:15.373
(children singing indistinctly,
<i>static hisses)</i>

21:15.375 --> 21:17.441
<i>He had the original</i>
<i>flight plan, cyrus,</i>

21:17.443 --> 21:20.411
And he was gonna use it--
<i>(children singing,</i>
<i>static hissing)</i>

21:20.413 --> 21:22.013
<i>(children continue</i>
<i>singing indistinctly)</i>

21:22.015 --> 21:23.414
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

21:23.416 --> 21:26.751
<i>A loaded gun that I was</i>
<i>not about to let go off.</i>

21:26.753 --> 21:28.486
<i>So taking care of the man?</i>
<i>Necessary.</i>

21:28.488 --> 21:31.322
<i>Giving you a heads-up?</i>
<i>Less so.</i>

21:31.324 --> 21:32.690
<i>(woman) this day</i>
<i>could not have gone worse</i>

21:32.692 --> 21:35.593
<i>(man) the defense,</i>
<i>who we should point out,</i>

21:35.595 --> 21:39.630
<i>How do we think ms. Pope</i>
<i>is feeling right now, anne?</i>

21:39.632 --> 21:41.899
<i>First she's accused of</i>
<i>an affair with the president,</i>

21:41.901 --> 21:45.503
<i>By real mistress</i>
<i>jeannine locke, and now this.</i>

21:45.505 --> 21:47.405
<i>(anne) that's right, tanner,</i>
<i>and let's not forget,</i>

21:47.407 --> 21:48.806
<i>This is a woman</i>
<i>who used to command</i>

21:48.808 --> 21:50.675
<i>A lot of respect</i>
<i>in this town.</i>

21:50.677 --> 21:52.076
<i>Her name alone was enough</i>
<i>to strike fear</i>

21:52.078 --> 21:53.844
<i>Into people's hearts.</i>

21:53.846 --> 21:55.479
<i>(tanner) and now it's close</i>
<i>to becoming a punchline.</i>

21:55.481 --> 21:57.014
(turns tv off)

21:57.016 --> 21:58.749
If you're coming to say
that we need to drop the case,

21:58.751 --> 22:00.618
Don't waste your time.
He lied to us, liv.

22:00.620 --> 22:02.086
And if he lied to us
about the sexting,

22:02.088 --> 22:03.754
Who's to say he's not lying
about killing the girl?

22:03.756 --> 22:05.456
Shelley meyers
is in the wind, gone.

22:05.458 --> 22:06.757
She's not answering
her cell.

22:06.759 --> 22:08.592
She's not at home
or her sister's.

22:08.594 --> 22:09.927
If we jump ship now,
we just look smart.

22:09.929 --> 22:13.731
We can all work for free
just for a few months.

22:13.733 --> 22:15.533
We're not broke yet.
We're fine. I have my savings.

22:15.535 --> 22:18.769
You shouldn't have to use it.
Quitting is not an option.

22:18.771 --> 22:20.738
Harrison, tomorrow morning,

22:20.740 --> 22:22.773
Do whatever you have to do
to stall.

22:22.775 --> 22:26.377
Buy us some time with the judge
until we track shelley down.

22:26.379 --> 22:28.813
Please. Go. Find her.

22:32.918 --> 22:34.685
(sighs)

22:39.458 --> 22:41.792
Bad time?
You shouldn't be here.

22:41.794 --> 22:43.461
Does the name pete foster
mean anything to you?

22:43.463 --> 22:45.129
That's who your father
had huck kill.
What did I tell you?

22:45.131 --> 22:46.664
He was in possession
of something dangerous,

22:46.666 --> 22:47.798
And not just to your father.

22:47.800 --> 22:48.933
To fitz, to the white house.

22:48.935 --> 22:50.101
It was a flight plan
of some kind.

22:50.103 --> 22:51.802
I have no idea
what you're talking about,

22:51.804 --> 22:54.939
Okay. Look.
Pete foster was a pilot.
(file rustling)

22:54.941 --> 22:56.741
He flew 86 missions,
but there are only 85

22:56.743 --> 22:58.075
Listed individually
on his jacket,

22:58.077 --> 22:59.610
Which means that one of them
is missing--

22:59.612 --> 23:01.645
Stop. I have told you
over and over

23:01.647 --> 23:02.980
That I want nothing to do
with this--

23:02.982 --> 23:04.882
What the white house does,
my father--none of it.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.684
So take your files
and your conspiracies

23:06.686 --> 23:09.653
And leave my office. Now.

23:12.425 --> 23:16.160
(projector and camera shutter
clicks)

23:21.700 --> 23:23.067
(door closes)

23:26.938 --> 23:29.607
(door opens and closes)

23:36.047 --> 23:37.581
(clicks switch)

23:39.451 --> 23:42.853
(cyrus) or, okay, I don't know,
<i>you could have not killed him.</i>

23:42.855 --> 23:45.723
<i>(rowan) calm down, cyrus.</i>
<i>Pete foster killed pete foster.</i>

23:45.725 --> 23:48.759
<i>Calm down, cyrus.</i>
<i>Pete foster killed pete foster.</i>
<i>No! (groaning)</i>

23:48.761 --> 23:51.462
(children singing indistinctly)

23:51.464 --> 23:55.533
<i>(child speaks indistinctly)</i>
<i>pete foster had</i>
<i>every intention--</i>

23:55.535 --> 23:58.536
<i>...On grant. A loaded gun that</i>
<i>I was not about to let go off.</i>

23:58.538 --> 24:01.739
<i>He had the original</i>
<i>flight plan, cyrus,</i>

24:01.741 --> 24:07.211
<i>He had the original</i>
<i>flight plan, cyrus.</i>

24:08.447 --> 24:10.080
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

24:11.917 --> 24:13.751
(thud)

24:13.753 --> 24:15.820
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

24:17.956 --> 24:20.825
<i>Pete foster</i>
<i>killed pete foster.</i>

24:21.760 --> 24:24.528
...Left some unfinished
business for you inside.

24:29.569 --> 24:33.571
<i>Of foot-in-mouth disease</i>
<i>from time to time.</i>

24:33.573 --> 24:37.842
<i>First lady apologized.</i>
<i>Apology accepted.</i>

24:37.844 --> 24:39.577
<i>I will say this, though.</i>

24:39.579 --> 24:43.714
(turns off tv
sets down remote control)
a star is born.
You should be so proud.

24:43.716 --> 24:45.649
I apologized.
What more can I do?

24:45.651 --> 24:48.052
You didn't just create a star.
You created a movement.

24:48.054 --> 24:49.920
A movement? Please.

24:49.922 --> 24:52.857
Her favorables are up
12 points in the last 2 days.

24:52.859 --> 24:55.593
(groans)
she's been top 10 on twitter
for the last 48 hours.

24:55.595 --> 24:57.561
And you know what else
is trending?

24:57.563 --> 24:59.263
Hashtag--
"mellie has a big fat mouth--"
leave her alone!

24:59.265 --> 25:02.266
Her apology was gracious.

25:02.268 --> 25:03.868
Sir, with all due respect--
(fitz) enough!

25:03.870 --> 25:05.636
Take a walk, cyrus.

25:07.706 --> 25:09.707
(papers rustle)

25:09.709 --> 25:11.675
(exhales) thank you.

25:11.677 --> 25:13.944
We all make mistakes.

25:23.922 --> 25:25.022
(gasps)

25:29.828 --> 25:31.529
(exhales sharply)

25:31.531 --> 25:33.664
You're going to fly out
to montana right now.

25:33.666 --> 25:34.999
Today!

25:35.001 --> 25:36.834
And you are going to walk
the deserted streets

25:36.836 --> 25:38.969
Of seven forks
or horsefly gulch

25:38.971 --> 25:41.272
Or apache tears or whatever
the hell the name is

25:41.274 --> 25:43.607
Of the hick town
our calamity jane calls home,

25:43.609 --> 25:44.975
And you're going to talk
to everyone

25:44.977 --> 25:47.144
From her second grade teacher
to the first boy

25:47.146 --> 25:48.879
Who put his hand
under her blouse,

25:48.881 --> 25:50.581
And you are going to
come back

25:50.583 --> 25:52.283
With some good
old-fashioned dirt!

25:52.285 --> 25:54.218
That's how nixon did it
way back when,

25:54.220 --> 25:55.853
And it still works.

25:55.855 --> 25:57.655
Understood?

25:57.657 --> 26:01.625
Good. Now... Get going.

26:01.627 --> 26:03.694
(taps on glass)

26:05.564 --> 26:07.631
No.
No, what?

26:07.633 --> 26:09.900
No, I will not be a pawn
in whatever stalling tactic

26:09.902 --> 26:11.068
You're about to employ.

26:11.070 --> 26:12.836
Not after I spent
the entire morning

26:12.838 --> 26:14.905
At the courthouse
convincing judge gaynes

26:14.907 --> 26:17.241
That your request to add
six more addiction experts

26:17.243 --> 26:19.343
To the witness list was really
just a way of hiding the fact

26:19.345 --> 26:21.078
That you've lost
shelley meyers.

26:21.080 --> 26:22.646
Luckily, she agreed with me.

26:22.648 --> 26:25.349
We're moving on
to closing arguments.

26:25.351 --> 26:28.018
Actually, I was seeing if you
wanted to have lunch.

26:28.020 --> 26:30.654
Oh.
Is that a yes or a no?

26:30.656 --> 26:33.157
I don't know.
Am I hungry or full?

26:33.159 --> 26:34.992
Salad or sandwich?
And don't get me started

26:34.994 --> 26:36.327
On drinks and desserts--
I'd be lost.

26:36.329 --> 26:39.663
Okay. I get that you're...
Miffed.

26:39.665 --> 26:42.833
Miffed? Nah. I'm done
waiting for a decision.

26:42.835 --> 26:44.168
I'll make it easy for you.

26:44.170 --> 26:46.036
You won't give me
a straight answer? In or out?

26:46.038 --> 26:48.973
I'll give you one.
I'm out. I'm done.

26:48.975 --> 26:50.608
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

26:50.610 --> 26:52.309
Any luck
finding shelley meyers?

26:52.311 --> 26:54.144
We tracked credit cards,
a.T.M.S.

26:54.146 --> 26:55.679
I hacked into her e-mail.
Nothing.

26:55.681 --> 26:56.914
Where would you go
if you had lots of money

26:56.916 --> 26:58.282
And wanted to go away
somewhere alone?

26:58.284 --> 26:59.917
(quinn) easy. The fanciest hotel
I could find.

26:59.919 --> 27:03.087
Shelley's smart. With the media
attention she's getting,

27:03.089 --> 27:04.989
She'd know to use an alias.
So what are we thinking?

27:04.991 --> 27:06.624
A movie character?
Someone from a novel?

27:06.626 --> 27:08.926
Besides the fact that
her husband's circumcised.

27:08.928 --> 27:10.394
Elizabeth cady stanton.

27:10.396 --> 27:13.197
Her daughter's writing
a history report about her.

27:13.199 --> 27:15.699
(types)
and just checked into
the grand district.

27:16.668 --> 27:18.302
(projector and camera shutter
clicking)

27:18.304 --> 27:20.771
There was a paralegal
I worked with once,

27:20.773 --> 27:22.806
A young guy,

27:22.808 --> 27:24.274
Fresh out of college,

27:24.276 --> 27:28.646
Who had
the most amazing thighs.

27:28.648 --> 27:30.314
They said he played soccer.

27:30.316 --> 27:31.882
I'm assuming it was
from that.

27:31.884 --> 27:34.184
Anyway... (sips)

27:34.186 --> 27:36.086
We were sitting
in the lunchroom one day,

27:36.088 --> 27:39.857
And his shoe
brushed up against mine

27:39.859 --> 27:42.059
Under the table.

27:42.061 --> 27:45.362
I should have pulled
my foot away, but I didn't.

27:45.364 --> 27:47.364
I kept it there,
gently touching his,

27:47.366 --> 27:50.000
Even though I was married
and I knew it was wrong.

27:50.002 --> 27:51.769
(huffs)

27:51.771 --> 27:54.304
The guilt I felt that day.

27:54.306 --> 27:57.708
Touching his shoe.

27:57.710 --> 27:59.843
(laughs)

27:59.845 --> 28:02.446
You would have thought
we screwed in the supply closet.
Miss meyers--

28:02.448 --> 28:05.249
(glass clatters)
I'm done forgiving him.

28:05.251 --> 28:08.085
The sacrifices I have
made for that man.

28:08.087 --> 28:10.354
The marriage I protected
because...

28:10.356 --> 28:13.290
I thought it actually
meant something.

28:13.292 --> 28:15.426
And for what?
So he could

28:15.428 --> 28:19.329
Shove a camera
down his pants.

28:19.331 --> 28:21.131
(sighs)

28:21.133 --> 28:22.933
I'm a partner
at a law firm.

28:24.335 --> 28:28.238
And he has made me
look like...

28:28.240 --> 28:30.808
The weakest, most backwards
anti-feminist

28:30.810 --> 28:32.176
This world has ever known.

28:32.178 --> 28:35.279
And that is not the poster child
I am supposed to be.

28:35.281 --> 28:38.348
I am supposed to be...
A role model,

28:38.350 --> 28:41.285
A woman that my daughter
can look up to,

28:41.287 --> 28:43.487
Someone...

28:43.489 --> 28:45.289
She can admire.

28:47.192 --> 28:49.493
Oh...

28:49.495 --> 28:51.795
Ah, I should have screwed
that kid,

28:51.797 --> 28:53.197
Him and his
beautiful thighs.

28:53.199 --> 28:54.498
I should have just
brought him home

28:54.500 --> 28:56.033
And banged him
in our bed!

28:56.035 --> 28:58.202
I can recommend
a divorce lawyer, ms. Meyers.

28:58.204 --> 29:01.004
That's a punishment
that meets the crime.

29:01.006 --> 29:02.773
But sending your husband
to prison--

29:02.775 --> 29:05.309
Which is what's going to happen
if you don't testify tomorrow--

29:05.311 --> 29:07.277
It's not right.

29:07.279 --> 29:09.113
It's not right,
and you know it.

29:09.115 --> 29:10.514
So I'm supposed to do what,

29:10.516 --> 29:12.382
Just get up
on the witness stand

29:12.384 --> 29:14.151
And pretend
that I'm not hurt?

29:14.153 --> 29:17.988
Pretend that I don't
find him despicable?

29:17.990 --> 29:20.390
Because I'm not that good
an actor, ms. Pope.

29:22.494 --> 29:24.828
They will know I am lying.

29:29.434 --> 29:32.136
What if you didn't
have to lie?

29:34.239 --> 29:37.141
The coroner has testified
that ms. Oaks' time of death

29:37.143 --> 29:38.475
Was between 8:00 and 10:00 p.M.

29:38.477 --> 29:40.043
Where were you at that time?

29:40.045 --> 29:41.478
At home with my husband.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.514
The defendant was with you
that entire window of time?

29:43.516 --> 29:45.916
The whole evening,
until we went to bed at 11:00.

29:45.918 --> 29:47.785
So could your husband
have possibly been

29:47.787 --> 29:50.020
At ms. Oaks' apartment
to murder her?
He could not.

29:50.022 --> 29:51.155
Your witness.

29:51.157 --> 29:52.489
Mrs. Meyers, you don't want

29:52.491 --> 29:54.158
Your husband to go to jail,
do you?

29:54.160 --> 29:56.827
No.
I'm sorry. "no," what?

29:56.829 --> 29:58.495
No, I don't want him
to go to jail.

29:58.497 --> 30:01.999
And you'd like to help him
avoid that. Isn't that right?

30:02.001 --> 30:04.201
Yes.
And so you'd say
pretty much anything

30:04.203 --> 30:05.969
To get him acquitted, correct?
Objection, your honor.

30:05.971 --> 30:08.205
Withdrawn.

30:08.207 --> 30:10.040
As you know, mrs. Meyers,
in u.S. Law

30:10.042 --> 30:11.942
We have something called
marital privilege,

30:11.944 --> 30:14.511
Whereby an individual can't be
compelled to testify

30:14.513 --> 30:17.481
It can make
my prosecutor's job harder,

30:17.483 --> 30:19.349
But I fully support
that principle.

30:19.351 --> 30:21.318
Because I look at it
this way--

30:21.320 --> 30:23.220
Why in the world would a jury

30:23.222 --> 30:25.222
Believe a wife's testimony
anyway

30:25.224 --> 30:26.957
When it's clearly going to be
prejudiced

30:26.959 --> 30:28.525
In her husband's favor?
Don't you agree?

30:28.527 --> 30:30.494
Your honor--
enough, mr. Rosen.

30:30.496 --> 30:32.296
The jury will disregard.

30:33.498 --> 30:36.333
Do you love your husband,
mrs. Meyers?

30:36.335 --> 30:38.435
No.

30:38.437 --> 30:40.237
(gallery murmuring)
I'm sorry?

30:40.239 --> 30:42.206
You've heard the disgusting
things he's been doing.

30:42.208 --> 30:44.508
He's a pig.
He makes me sick.

30:44.510 --> 30:46.844
(whispers)
what's she doing?
Telling the truth.

30:46.846 --> 30:49.413
So... You don't love
your husband?

30:49.415 --> 30:51.148
My husband has disgraced
his office

30:51.150 --> 30:52.382
And dishonored our marriage.

30:52.384 --> 30:55.118
He's a pervert and a creep,
and I hate him.

30:55.120 --> 30:56.887
I would love to see him
go to jail

30:56.889 --> 30:58.355
For the rest of his life,
but you don't go to jail

30:58.357 --> 31:00.057
For being a cheating,
lying bastard.

31:00.059 --> 31:02.092
You go to jail
for being a murderer,

31:02.094 --> 31:04.461
Which he's not.

31:04.463 --> 31:06.196
He didn't kill that girl.

31:12.937 --> 31:15.239
(projector and camera shutter
click)

31:17.909 --> 31:20.644
(clicking mouse)

31:20.646 --> 31:24.181
(tapping key)

31:24.183 --> 31:26.617
Is that who you killed?

31:26.619 --> 31:28.552
Looks like his wrists
are slashed.

31:28.554 --> 31:30.387
Is that to make it look
like a suicide?

31:30.389 --> 31:32.055
I'm assuming there's
a special way of doing that,

31:32.057 --> 31:33.357
Ways of angling the blade

31:33.359 --> 31:35.058
So the cops can't tell
it was staged.

31:35.060 --> 31:36.960
It's not polite
to sneak up on people.

31:36.962 --> 31:39.229
(sighs) you need someone
to talk to, huck.

31:39.231 --> 31:41.198
You wouldn't go to those
meetings if you didn't.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.267
With me, you don't have
to call it "whiskey."

31:43.269 --> 31:45.469
Okay? You can call it
what it is.

31:45.471 --> 31:46.937
Don't do this alone,
huck.

31:48.473 --> 31:50.007
(door closes)
(sighs)

31:50.009 --> 31:52.075
(projector and camera shutter
click)

31:52.077 --> 31:55.245
(knock on door)

31:57.415 --> 31:59.416
No.
I need to talk to you.

31:59.418 --> 32:02.319
There's nothing
to talk about.
Yeah, there is.

32:08.961 --> 32:12.596
<i>A loaded gun that I was</i>
<i>not about to let go off. So--</i>

32:12.598 --> 32:13.997
What does
any of this mean?

32:13.999 --> 32:15.265
There were numbers
on his body.

32:15.267 --> 32:16.300
(jake) pete foster's body.
Tattooed.

32:16.302 --> 32:19.202
For a secret mission
called operation remington.

32:19.204 --> 32:20.971
It was a rescue,
during the first gulf war,

32:20.973 --> 32:23.073
On iranian soil.
That's why
it's classified.

32:23.075 --> 32:24.508
I was on that mission.
There were five of us

32:24.510 --> 32:26.376
On the ground and one plane
flying air support.

32:26.378 --> 32:28.011
And the pilot on that plane
was pete foster.

32:28.013 --> 32:31.949
No. That pilot
was the president.

32:31.951 --> 32:33.583
So why does this guy go
get a tattoo

32:33.585 --> 32:38.288
Maybe for the same reason
your father wanted him dead.

32:38.290 --> 32:41.258
(projector and camera shutter
click)

32:41.260 --> 32:43.060
Sir, I'm sorry--

32:43.062 --> 32:44.528
Cowboy boots? Are those--

32:44.530 --> 32:47.064
Yes, sir.
I figured it was okay.

32:47.066 --> 32:48.398
After all,
we are republicans.

32:48.400 --> 32:49.967
This isn't the bush
white house, ethan.

32:49.969 --> 32:51.735
We don't wear cowboy boots.
Understood, but listen--

32:51.737 --> 32:53.437
We wear shoes, real shoes.
Sir--

32:53.439 --> 32:55.205
Thinking man's shoes.
I failed you, sir.

32:55.207 --> 32:58.241
What are you--
I didn't do so well
in montana--

32:58.243 --> 33:00.077
Except for the boots,
or so I thought.

33:00.079 --> 33:01.912
Ethan...
The only thing I got

33:01.914 --> 33:03.513
Was that at 15,
josephine marcus

33:03.515 --> 33:05.615
Walked into a maternity ward
pregnant.

33:05.617 --> 33:08.251
But when she walked out,
there was no baby

33:08.253 --> 33:10.420
And no birth certificate,
so...

33:10.422 --> 33:12.089
No proof.

33:12.091 --> 33:13.757
You didn't fail me, ethan.

33:13.759 --> 33:15.759
No?
Not at all.

33:17.595 --> 33:19.262
How long before a verdict?

33:19.264 --> 33:20.697
Could be ten minutes,
could be ten hours.

33:20.699 --> 33:23.333
I'll go sniff around,
see what I can find out.

33:25.103 --> 33:26.403
(door closes)

33:27.538 --> 33:29.239
You all right?

33:29.241 --> 33:32.109
I didn't realize how much
she hated me until just now.

33:32.111 --> 33:33.443
She hates me, olivia.

33:33.445 --> 33:34.745
The way she looked at me
in there--

33:34.747 --> 33:37.180
My wife of 20 years
hates my guts.

33:37.182 --> 33:39.182
I did this to her.

33:39.184 --> 33:40.550
I dragged her
into my muck.

33:40.552 --> 33:42.152
She'll get through this,
senator.

33:42.154 --> 33:43.787
She's a strong woman.

33:43.789 --> 33:47.190
And maybe in time,
she'll forgive you... Again.

33:47.192 --> 33:49.426
But she won't forgive
herself.

33:49.428 --> 33:51.161
For what?

33:51.163 --> 33:52.662
Lying for me.

33:52.664 --> 33:55.532
I didn't kill that woman,
ms. Pope.

33:55.534 --> 33:57.134
But there's nobody
who can prove that.

33:57.136 --> 33:59.202
Certainly not shelley.
She was out shopping that night.

33:59.204 --> 34:02.372
She came home late.
She lied to give me an alibi.

34:02.374 --> 34:05.542
She's a lawyer, olivia.
She believes in the law.

34:05.544 --> 34:07.544
She's gonna carry this
with her forever.

34:07.546 --> 34:10.047
(door opens)
here we go. Jury's back in.

34:11.449 --> 34:14.217
The defendant and counsel
will please rise.

34:14.219 --> 34:16.386
The clerk will now read
and record the verdict.

34:16.388 --> 34:19.256

34:29.201 --> 34:30.700
Would like to thank the jurors
for their service.

34:30.702 --> 34:33.703
Mr. Meyers, you have no further
business with this court.

34:33.705 --> 34:36.540
You are free to go,
and court is adjourned.

34:36.542 --> 34:38.141

34:38.143 --> 34:42.245
(indistinct conversations)

34:46.517 --> 34:48.452
(lowered voice)
you weren't his alibi.

34:48.454 --> 34:50.287
Excuse me?

34:50.289 --> 34:53.590
He was yours. You followed him
over to desiree's place,

34:53.592 --> 34:57.160
Waited until he left,
and killed her.

34:57.162 --> 34:58.628
You thought
you could fix it.

34:58.630 --> 35:00.797
You thought there was
just one.

35:03.167 --> 35:04.634
Well...

35:04.636 --> 35:07.571
It's like you said,
olivia.

35:07.573 --> 35:10.774
We all deserve
a second chance.

35:12.543 --> 35:14.578

at once)

35:14.580 --> 35:16.346

35:28.227 --> 35:29.793
Boy, do I love
a slutty teen.

35:29.795 --> 35:32.129
We should have something
to leak in a day or two.

35:32.131 --> 35:33.864
Anything else?

35:33.866 --> 35:35.765
No, sir.

35:37.535 --> 35:40.437
Actually... Yes.

35:40.439 --> 35:43.440
It's about the funeral
you went to.

35:45.376 --> 35:47.310
What about it?

35:47.312 --> 35:49.813
This is an election year,
sir, and I'd hate to see

35:49.815 --> 35:51.481
Your conscience get
in the way of your goal.

35:51.483 --> 35:53.350
Who told you?
Who is not important.

35:53.352 --> 35:55.886
What's important is
keeping you in the white house.

35:57.288 --> 35:59.556
And if you keep looking
backwards,

35:59.558 --> 36:02.893
Dredging things up
that ought to stay buried,

36:02.895 --> 36:05.395
Well, then people
are going to notice.

36:05.397 --> 36:07.697
And they'll pick up shovels
and start digging themselves,

36:07.699 --> 36:10.233
And we know what they'll find
at the bottom

36:10.235 --> 36:12.469
Of that cracker jack box.

36:12.471 --> 36:14.237
Don't we?

36:16.474 --> 36:19.676
Do you think...

36:19.678 --> 36:22.646
We can leave the past
in the past, sir?

36:28.953 --> 36:31.188
Good.

36:31.190 --> 36:33.256
Then that's all we'll say
on this matter.

36:43.668 --> 36:44.734
Where were you?

36:44.736 --> 36:47.204
You have to stop
asking questions.

36:47.206 --> 36:48.939
(sighs)
look, I am worried about you.

36:48.941 --> 36:51.942
You have to stop
asking questions!

36:51.944 --> 36:53.877
You're not worried
about me.

36:53.879 --> 36:55.845
You're interested. You wanna
know what it feels like

36:55.847 --> 36:57.347
To do the things that I do.
I see you.

36:57.349 --> 36:59.616
I see that look in your eye
every time you ask me

36:59.618 --> 37:01.518
One of your questions
about where I was

37:01.520 --> 37:04.688
And what I've been doing.
You're interested.

37:04.690 --> 37:07.791
And maybe that's because
you're able to see me, too--

37:07.793 --> 37:08.959
How my mouth has been dry
for months,

37:08.961 --> 37:11.595
How I've been squirming
and vibrating,

37:11.597 --> 37:13.663
And it wouldn't stop
until the other night

37:13.665 --> 37:16.533
When everything
just stopped,

37:16.535 --> 37:18.368
And I wasn't thirsty
anymore.

37:18.370 --> 37:20.837
All these questions
you're asking--

37:20.839 --> 37:22.305
They have answers,

37:22.307 --> 37:24.841
But you don't wanna
know them.

37:24.843 --> 37:26.910
So stop being interested.

37:26.912 --> 37:29.279
And stop asking questions.

37:29.281 --> 37:31.248
Stop.

37:31.250 --> 37:32.849
Stop while you still can.

38:13.325 --> 38:14.424
I don't wanna play games
either.

38:14.426 --> 38:15.525
So?

38:15.527 --> 38:16.960
So I'm...

38:16.962 --> 38:20.797
Outside your door,
and I'd like to come in.

38:24.535 --> 38:26.403
(cell phone beeps)

38:31.309 --> 38:34.377
(laughs)

38:44.689 --> 38:47.090
You okay?

38:47.092 --> 38:51.895
Yeah, sure. I'm just...

38:55.766 --> 38:57.500
(bottle clatters)

38:57.502 --> 38:58.868
I don't know what I am.

39:00.771 --> 39:02.739
Well, you're the daughter
of the man

39:02.741 --> 39:04.040
That runs
the top secret organization

39:04.042 --> 39:05.742
That made your friend
kill a man for some reason

39:05.744 --> 39:08.011
Having to do with your
ex-boyfriend, the president.

39:08.013 --> 39:09.979
(chuckles)

39:09.981 --> 39:12.449
Look, uh...

39:13.884 --> 39:15.018
Hey, hey.

39:15.020 --> 39:16.986
Come on. Don't cry.

39:16.988 --> 39:18.621
I'm not crying.

39:18.623 --> 39:22.459
I'm trying
not to scream.

39:23.928 --> 39:26.663
(breathing heavily)

39:26.665 --> 39:28.365
(gasps)

39:30.801 --> 39:32.001
(whispers) I'm scared.

39:32.003 --> 39:34.070
Okay.

39:34.072 --> 39:36.139
(sets down glass)

39:36.141 --> 39:37.674
Put your head right here.

39:37.676 --> 39:39.376
(laughs)

39:39.378 --> 39:43.646
(chuckles)
come on. Do it.

39:45.116 --> 39:46.916
Do it.

39:46.918 --> 39:49.152
(sighs)

39:49.154 --> 39:50.553
(whispers) there.

39:50.555 --> 39:52.422
(sighs)

39:54.492 --> 39:56.893
You're not alone in this.

39:56.895 --> 39:59.396
I'm not going anywhere.

40:06.070 --> 40:08.605
I'm not going anywhere.

40:35.566 --> 40:36.900
(cell phone rings)

40:36.902 --> 40:38.034
(exhales)

40:38.036 --> 40:40.703
Don't answer it.
(exhales)

40:40.705 --> 40:42.038
(ring)

40:42.040 --> 40:43.473
Um...

40:43.475 --> 40:45.442
(exhales)

40:45.444 --> 40:48.645
(ring)

40:48.647 --> 40:51.147
It could be important.

40:51.149 --> 40:53.082
(ring)

40:53.084 --> 40:54.217
(beep)

40:54.219 --> 40:55.618
Mr. President.

40:55.620 --> 40:57.454
Why so formal?

40:57.456 --> 40:59.055
What can I do for you?

40:59.057 --> 41:00.623
Do for me?

41:00.625 --> 41:02.425
Does everything have to be
transactional in this town?

41:02.427 --> 41:03.860
Even with us?

41:03.862 --> 41:05.662
What happened? Rough day?

41:05.664 --> 41:08.097
You could say that.
How are you?

41:08.099 --> 41:13.203
I'm fine. You're, uh...
Are you okay?

41:18.142 --> 41:20.777
(exhales)

41:20.779 --> 41:22.645
I don't know how to answer that.

41:22.647 --> 41:25.215
I honestly don't.

41:25.217 --> 41:26.950
You sound...

41:26.952 --> 41:28.518
(jake) more wine?

41:31.489 --> 41:33.223
You have company.
Yes.

41:33.225 --> 41:34.691
Explains the formality.

41:34.693 --> 41:36.125
Sorry, it's just--
you should go.

41:36.127 --> 41:37.861
It's okay.
You have company.

41:37.863 --> 41:39.162
We can talk.

41:39.164 --> 41:40.864
That would be rude.

41:40.866 --> 41:43.166
Good-bye, olivia.
(cell phone beeps)

41:43.168 --> 41:45.835
(beep)

41:59.183 --> 42:01.885
We're here, sir.

42:13.564 --> 42:14.764
What the hell is this?

42:14.766 --> 42:17.066
This is a reunion--

42:17.068 --> 42:18.902
One that is long overdue.

42:23.674 --> 42:25.074
(projector and camera shutter
click)
