WEBVTT

00:02.291 --> 00:05.735
Kate's assistant, Liam... Could be
the son she gave up for adoption.

00:05.745 --> 00:08.145
Your company's secure
data has been breached.

00:08.214 --> 00:09.670
Kate was onto Liam.

00:09.680 --> 00:11.580
We're not gonna tell
the police anything.

00:11.682 --> 00:14.950
Did it ever occur to you that Liam
may have killed Kate to cover it up?

00:15.052 --> 00:17.586
I'm looking for her. Her name is Carly.

00:17.688 --> 00:19.088
How did you get that photo?

00:19.190 --> 00:21.190
Your wife sent it to me
right before she died.

00:21.325 --> 00:22.658
Where's Liam?

00:22.760 --> 00:24.460
Yeah, she knows where Liam is,

00:24.562 --> 00:26.896
but she's not talking... Yet.

00:31.669 --> 00:33.402
Yeah, I see you doing the math.

00:33.504 --> 00:36.572
Do you run? Dial 911?

00:36.674 --> 00:38.440
Problem is, you want answers.

00:38.543 --> 00:41.777
And by the time the cops show,
me and her will be gone.

00:41.913 --> 00:46.048
So are you staying, or are you going?

00:46.646 --> 00:48.329
You won't hurt her?

00:49.571 --> 00:51.289
That's up to her.

00:55.310 --> 00:57.393
I need answers.

00:57.495 --> 01:01.330
Look, Liam is a con man, a criminal.

01:01.432 --> 01:04.233
Stepping into this world,
you need to know two things...

01:04.334 --> 01:06.669
Everyone's lying,

01:06.771 --> 01:09.438
and stay out of my way.

01:09.540 --> 01:11.507
So, where's your boyfriend at?

01:11.609 --> 01:13.842
I told you he's not my boyfriend.

01:13.945 --> 01:15.911
I met him out maybe a month ago.

01:16.013 --> 01:19.448
Okay, and he bought
you a 79-inch 3-D TV?

01:19.458 --> 01:21.917
I just thought he really liked me.

01:22.019 --> 01:24.386
So Liam, the legit assistant,

01:24.488 --> 01:26.488
blew 30 grand on a month-long crush?

01:26.981 --> 01:29.291
Really?! That's your story?!

01:29.589 --> 01:31.060
Are you that dumb?!

01:33.297 --> 01:34.931
Look, give it up.

01:36.856 --> 01:39.323
I'm not buying the
babe in the woods act.

01:39.446 --> 01:42.908
You are gonna call Liam
and get him to meet you.

01:45.109 --> 01:47.409
- I told you...
- No. Look.

01:48.813 --> 01:51.680
You are gonna call Liam

01:51.782 --> 01:54.149
and get him to meet you.

01:54.676 --> 01:56.051
Now.

02:00.728 --> 02:01.944
Where?

02:03.094 --> 02:05.261
Dinah's in south Tryon.

02:09.076 --> 02:10.705
What's your name?

02:12.494 --> 02:13.842
Doesn't matter.

02:15.239 --> 02:17.172
What happens if she warns him?

02:17.275 --> 02:19.074
What happens if you warn him?

02:19.897 --> 02:22.344
Something bad.

03:07.325 --> 03:10.184
_

03:16.956 --> 03:19.748
You just said the Warner
forensics report was here.

03:19.758 --> 03:21.273
It was.

03:33.371 --> 03:36.385
- Have a seat, detective.
- Is that my forensics report?

03:36.487 --> 03:39.922
I'm proud that in the six months
you've been working for me,

03:40.024 --> 03:41.457
we've already developed a shorthand.

03:41.559 --> 03:43.659
- We have a shorthand?
- Yes.

03:43.761 --> 03:45.461
When you march in here barking at me,

03:45.563 --> 03:48.163
I know that's shorthand for,
"I'm ready to update you, sir."

03:48.265 --> 03:50.032
And when I say, "please have a seat,"

03:50.134 --> 03:53.123
you know that's shorthand
for "sit your ass down."

03:58.542 --> 03:59.875
The Tom Murphy case

03:59.977 --> 04:02.945
is still fresh in the
minds of many people.

04:03.047 --> 04:05.481
I solved the murder of a 5-year-old.

04:05.583 --> 04:07.516
I know that, and you know that,

04:07.526 --> 04:09.752
but all the D.A. knows is
you brought evidence

04:09.854 --> 04:11.987
that overturned their
Ben Crawford conviction.

04:12.089 --> 04:14.256
Not before he was murdered in prison.

04:14.358 --> 04:17.826
The D.A. was humiliated, and
now that office is out to get you.

04:17.928 --> 04:19.795
So why did you put me on this case?

04:19.863 --> 04:21.829
The Mayor is friends with John Warner.

04:21.932 --> 04:23.499
He asked for my best detective.

04:23.601 --> 04:25.134
Imagine my dilemma.

04:25.236 --> 04:28.370
This case will be bulletproof, sir.

04:31.609 --> 04:35.310
The stems from the plant on the
rooftop were freshly broken,

04:35.413 --> 04:38.595
confirming your take on where
the struggle took place.

04:38.762 --> 04:40.471
Where are you with your witnesses?

04:40.833 --> 04:42.912
It's too early to say.

04:44.828 --> 04:48.490
I know a lot of cops in here blame
you for detective Dale's death,

04:48.592 --> 04:51.593
but since I'm not one of
them and you need an ally,

04:51.695 --> 04:54.763
how about you not treat
me like a complete moron?

04:57.305 --> 05:00.151
I have two witnesses
I haven't found yet.

05:00.310 --> 05:02.237
One is Kate's assistant,

05:02.339 --> 05:05.037
the other an unidentified
female party guest.

05:05.047 --> 05:07.342
I also have a high-level S.E.G. employee

05:07.445 --> 05:09.077
with no credible alibi,

05:09.180 --> 05:11.680
but I can't prove he's lying... Yet.

05:12.186 --> 05:14.683
Good. Go prove it.

05:17.021 --> 05:18.854
But play nice, huh?

05:18.923 --> 05:21.327
At least until we make an arrest.

05:21.433 --> 05:24.493
Oh, you know me. I'm a people person.

05:48.879 --> 05:51.153
It takes you six hours to call me back?

05:51.255 --> 05:53.663
Yeah, dude, it's conjugal night.

05:54.258 --> 05:56.892
Look, I'm not sure I can do the
noon Soica meeting tomorrow.

05:56.961 --> 05:58.861
This is a big deal. I need you to cover.

05:58.896 --> 06:00.963
All right. Noon, Soica
meeting. Done. I got it.

06:01.031 --> 06:02.064
I got to go, though.

06:02.132 --> 06:03.398
Wait, wait, wait.
I need to prep you, okay?

06:03.467 --> 06:04.633
Call me first thing in the morning.

06:04.702 --> 06:07.069
All right. I got it. I got to go.

06:07.137 --> 06:08.370
Patrick.

06:08.472 --> 06:11.968
Soica's the first company we
are trying to buy since...

06:12.435 --> 06:14.036
Since Kate.

06:14.362 --> 06:17.546
We need this to work, okay?

06:17.648 --> 06:19.147
Patrick.

06:19.216 --> 06:20.482
It's important.

06:23.220 --> 06:26.154
Patrick? Patrick?

06:26.257 --> 06:28.490
I got to go.

06:36.103 --> 06:38.333
It's been 45 minutes. He's a no-show.

06:38.435 --> 06:41.203
He said he'd be here. He promised.

06:43.007 --> 06:45.974
I'm such an idiot. I trusted him.

06:46.076 --> 06:48.377
Liam said he loved me.

06:48.479 --> 06:50.979
You warned him off. It's "something
bad" time, all right? Let's go.

06:51.081 --> 06:53.081
- You said you weren't gonna hurt her.
- No, I said it was up to her.

06:53.786 --> 06:56.451
Okay, just... God. Run!

06:56.554 --> 06:58.780
Cops are gonna come.
How's that gonna work out for you?

06:58.790 --> 06:59.820
- Move.
- No.

06:59.830 --> 07:03.091
Move. You know what?
You got no idea what you just did.

07:03.193 --> 07:05.152
Actually, I do. I do.

07:05.162 --> 07:06.528
So you can either kick my ass,

07:06.538 --> 07:09.131
or I can tell you exactly
where Liam's gonna be.

07:13.176 --> 07:14.976
So you think Liam could've
killed your wife?

07:15.370 --> 07:19.476
Kate knew he was getting credit cards
by using our clients' identities.

07:20.789 --> 07:22.543
If she confronted him...

07:22.944 --> 07:24.677
Let's just say it's a
question I'd like to ask him.

07:24.779 --> 07:26.245
Well, then maybe you
should've thought about that

07:26.314 --> 07:28.484
before letting his girlfriend escape.

07:28.494 --> 07:31.150
So, how do we find this kid?

07:31.761 --> 07:34.926
- How do you know my wife?
- You didn't answer me.

07:35.578 --> 07:37.289
Why did Kate send you that photo?

07:37.391 --> 07:39.224
I'll tell you after we find Liam.

07:39.327 --> 07:42.668
No. No. You'll tell me now.

07:47.301 --> 07:49.301
Well, someone's balls finally dropped.

07:52.156 --> 07:55.708
Kate texted me the photo
because I asked her to help me.

08:11.508 --> 08:12.591
Your first one?

08:13.129 --> 08:14.293
How'd you know?

08:14.395 --> 08:15.861
First time we bought
clothes for our daughter,

08:15.930 --> 08:17.997
my wife had the same look on her face.

08:18.132 --> 08:19.498
How old's your daughter now?

08:19.600 --> 08:20.899
She's, uh, 18.

08:21.002 --> 08:22.668
Her name's Rachel.

08:22.737 --> 08:24.945
- That's a beautiful name.
- Check this out.

08:24.955 --> 08:26.619
This is, uh... This is me and rach,

08:26.629 --> 08:28.474
um, when she was in little league.

08:28.576 --> 08:31.010
She was 5 years old.

08:31.045 --> 08:33.178
And that's us at Rockefeller Center.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.780
She was 13.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.815
- She's so sweet.
- Thanks.

08:46.996 --> 08:49.328
Look, you need to see this last picture.

08:55.192 --> 08:56.535
It's the company Skybox.

08:56.637 --> 08:59.838
And that's my daughter and her friend

08:59.907 --> 09:02.474
and you and your husband.

09:03.227 --> 09:04.743
Uh, I-i don't understand.

09:04.845 --> 09:07.279
She's missing.

09:07.348 --> 09:10.220
Um, she came down here seven
weeks ago to see her friend,

09:10.230 --> 09:12.484
and nobody's seen her since.

09:13.089 --> 09:14.816
I'm so sorry.

09:16.157 --> 09:18.390
I-I-i don't... I don't remember her.

09:18.492 --> 09:20.592
Look, I-i know you're
only a few months along,

09:21.230 --> 09:23.262
and already you love that baby.

09:23.364 --> 09:28.575
Imagine 18 years for
that love to grow and...

09:31.139 --> 09:33.917
Then your baby's just gone.

09:34.357 --> 09:36.075
I want to help you. I-i do.

09:36.177 --> 09:37.476
But I...

09:37.578 --> 09:39.778
I don't remember Rachel or...
Or her friend.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.213
It... it's a Skybox.

09:41.315 --> 09:43.075
You know, random people
come and go all night.

09:43.085 --> 09:46.051
Okay. I'm sorry if I scared you.

09:46.153 --> 09:49.957
Um, this is my cell just...
Just in case.

09:52.593 --> 09:54.093
If I see your daughter or her friend,

09:54.161 --> 09:56.128
- I'll let you know.
- Oh.

09:56.230 --> 09:59.264
- I promise you.
- All right, thank you.

10:01.001 --> 10:02.501
And Kate kept her word.

10:02.536 --> 10:05.070
She sent me the photo when
she saw Carly at your party.

10:06.292 --> 10:08.520
- I'm sorry.
- Hmm, for my daughter being missing,

10:08.530 --> 10:10.742
or for letting my best lead
to finding her get away?

10:10.811 --> 10:12.544
I was concerned you were gonna hurt her.

10:12.646 --> 10:14.646
Okay, what if she was
involved in Kate's murder?

10:14.715 --> 10:16.949
How concerned for her would you be then?

10:17.017 --> 10:20.919
You see, right now our interests align.

10:21.396 --> 10:23.021
Okay, as long as it stays that way,

10:23.090 --> 10:24.971
nobody's gonna get hurt.

10:25.632 --> 10:26.825
No one.

10:27.658 --> 10:29.828
- You mean me.
- Look, you're just about to tell me

10:29.864 --> 10:31.689
how we find this kid, right?

10:34.301 --> 10:37.006
Carnage. Just like on the girl's shirt.

10:37.016 --> 10:38.637
How's that help find the kid?

10:41.743 --> 10:43.531
Somebody's here.

10:46.446 --> 10:48.280
- Morning.
- What are you doing here so early?

10:49.353 --> 10:51.423
It's easier to catch up on stuff.

10:51.573 --> 10:54.047
Plus, I like to listen to
my music kind of loud.

10:54.057 --> 10:56.221
Music? I thought I was having a stroke.

10:58.684 --> 11:00.926
Sorry. Guess I got a
little carried away.

11:01.028 --> 11:03.121
Um, but carnage is amazing, though.

11:03.131 --> 11:03.996
My girl put me onto him,

11:04.064 --> 11:05.764
and we see him basically
every time he plays in town.

11:05.866 --> 11:08.769
Plus if you wear one of his
t-shirts, you get in for free.

11:08.779 --> 11:11.603
Mm. What do you have to wear to get out?

11:12.528 --> 11:13.739
I think we walked in on him

11:13.841 --> 11:17.676
hacking into our clients'
information, so he improvised.

11:18.459 --> 11:20.812
But when he used the deejay
to try and distract us,

11:20.848 --> 11:22.814
he accidentally used the truth.

11:23.665 --> 11:25.417
Scroll down.

11:25.519 --> 11:27.578
She was wearing that t-shirt

11:27.588 --> 11:30.443
because Liam's favorite
deejay is playing tonight.

11:31.025 --> 11:33.225
People, are you ready?!

11:36.897 --> 11:39.298
Keep the car running. I'll find Liam.

11:45.272 --> 11:48.073
People, are you ready?!

12:22.158 --> 12:23.575
Mr. Warner.

12:23.644 --> 12:25.934
We've got to stop meeting like this.

12:35.279 --> 12:36.618
Where'd you go?

12:36.628 --> 12:39.028
I saw the cops and bailed.

12:39.130 --> 12:40.696
Can't they help you find Rachel?

12:40.798 --> 12:42.966
Look, it's complicated.

12:43.917 --> 12:45.888
Well, look, they...
They took Liam, so I-I...

12:45.898 --> 12:48.104
- Drive.
- Where?

12:48.173 --> 12:49.803
To get him back.

12:51.300 --> 12:52.708
Go.

13:01.619 --> 13:03.753
All right, they may not
have enough for murder,

13:03.821 --> 13:06.022
so they're holding him
on an old fraud warrant.

13:06.090 --> 13:08.958
He got an old lady to sign her
farm over to a fake charity.

13:09.027 --> 13:11.661
"C" class felony, five-year minimum.

13:11.729 --> 13:13.515
Bail's set at 100 grand, bond's 10.

13:13.525 --> 13:16.299
All right, we need to bail him out.

13:16.367 --> 13:18.768
They're interrogating
Liam for killing my wife.

13:18.836 --> 13:20.570
Why would I want to get him out?

13:20.638 --> 13:22.605
Well, he'll get out anyway,
all right? He won't talk.

13:22.707 --> 13:25.341
He'll lawyer up, post bail,
and disappear again.

13:25.351 --> 13:28.144
But if we bail him out first,
we'll know when he's getting out,

13:28.246 --> 13:29.345
and we'll be there to grab him.

13:29.414 --> 13:31.380
The jail calls an hour
prior to release, man,

13:31.516 --> 13:34.116
so you could have him
anytime today after noon.

13:34.777 --> 13:36.886
Look, it's simple, okay?
Just go to work.

13:36.955 --> 13:38.888
Jail calls Billy, he calls me,

13:38.990 --> 13:41.123
I call you, and we can meet there.

13:45.830 --> 13:47.096
You want me to post the bond?

13:47.165 --> 13:51.465
Well, if you don't, we won't know when
he's getting out and we'll lose him.

13:53.503 --> 13:55.104
Look, Kate trusted me, okay?

13:55.206 --> 13:57.607
That's got to be worth something.

13:57.709 --> 14:01.410
I'm bailing Liam out. This is nuts.

14:01.546 --> 14:03.145
Ugh.

14:05.811 --> 14:07.591
My name's Danny.

14:08.419 --> 14:09.843
- Danny.
- Yeah.

14:09.853 --> 14:11.721
Yeah, that was worth 10 G's.

14:26.904 --> 14:28.838
This is Patrick. Leave a message.

14:30.075 --> 14:33.509
You were supposed to call.
Soica's at noon. Where are you?

14:37.209 --> 14:39.181
Damn it, Patrick.

14:45.047 --> 14:46.289
Morning.

14:57.001 --> 14:59.835
- Where is everybody?
- Your father had to go out of town,

14:59.971 --> 15:02.004
Neil's trying to close
the steelworkers union,

15:02.106 --> 15:04.273
and Patrick seems to be
taking the morning off.

15:04.342 --> 15:05.875
Okay.

15:14.919 --> 15:16.852
Where the hell are you?

15:16.921 --> 15:18.020
This is bad.

15:18.122 --> 15:20.550
Patrick. Patrick, focus.

15:20.560 --> 15:21.657
What about Soica?

15:21.726 --> 15:23.726
You said you'd be there.
What's going on?

15:23.828 --> 15:25.795
Leaving, pal? I only got an hour.

15:27.015 --> 15:29.031
Uh, bro, I'm not gonna make it.

15:29.133 --> 15:30.266
Patrick.

15:34.739 --> 15:39.608
So, Mr. Gollmer, would you prefer
I call you Anthony or Tony?

15:39.677 --> 15:43.212
You know, Liam's sort of grown on me.
Why don't we just stick with that?

15:43.222 --> 15:46.082
Well, Liam, your arrest record
paints a picture of a con man,

15:46.150 --> 15:48.150
a very accomplished one, given your age.

15:48.219 --> 15:49.285
Look, let's cut the crap.

15:49.387 --> 15:51.854
You're murder police.
This is about Kate's death.

15:51.956 --> 15:53.456
I'll speak to that,
but one question off topic,

15:53.591 --> 15:55.321
and I lawyer up, you got it?

15:59.864 --> 16:01.163
Did you kill her?

16:01.905 --> 16:04.864
No. I did not kill Kate Warner.

16:05.702 --> 16:07.035
I have an alibi.

16:11.137 --> 16:12.574
Just, uh, two vodka tonics.

16:13.032 --> 16:14.688
I need to see some I.D.

16:14.698 --> 16:16.311
Of course.

16:16.413 --> 16:18.646
Oh. Sorry.

16:20.117 --> 16:21.516
Thanks.

16:24.488 --> 16:26.254
Patrick, please stop.

16:26.323 --> 16:28.156
You don't want to ruin
tonight for him, do you?

16:28.258 --> 16:29.858
I'm not ruining anything. I'm fine.

16:29.960 --> 16:32.627
No, you're not fine.

16:33.378 --> 16:35.296
You're just a guest in this family.

16:36.939 --> 16:39.501
- He's cut off.
- Hey.

16:39.569 --> 16:41.703
You don't start minding
your own business, Kate,

16:41.805 --> 16:43.419
you're gonna get hurt.

16:46.267 --> 16:49.110
Most nights, Patrick was a happy drunk.

16:49.212 --> 16:51.646
Do you think he killed her?

16:51.748 --> 16:53.414
I told you what I saw.

16:53.517 --> 16:55.674
I'm asking you what you think.

16:58.312 --> 17:01.489
I think, on the wrong night,
the happiest drunk can turn mean.

17:08.241 --> 17:11.275
- Hello, Mr. Warner.
- Detective.

17:11.285 --> 17:14.539
Uh, Eric's at a big meeting
away from the office.

17:14.641 --> 17:18.242
Uh... I was actually
supposed to cover for him,

17:18.344 --> 17:19.844
but I wasn't feeling well.

17:19.913 --> 17:22.012
I feel much better now, just now.

17:22.115 --> 17:23.314
I see.

17:26.452 --> 17:29.354
- Uh, my father is out of town.
- So I heard.

17:36.197 --> 17:38.259
_

17:42.131 --> 17:43.668
Can I help you with something?

17:43.736 --> 17:45.236
Now that you mention it,

17:45.305 --> 17:49.040
I wanted to know about Kate's
assistant, Liam Connors.

17:49.976 --> 17:51.375
Did you know him well?

17:51.444 --> 17:53.244
Uh, no, we didn't bro out.

17:55.481 --> 17:58.249
When's the last time you saw him?

17:58.351 --> 18:00.318
Uh, we spoke at Eric's party.

18:02.789 --> 18:04.155
What about?

18:04.224 --> 18:07.592
Some last-minute work thing...
I sent him on an errand.

18:08.363 --> 18:10.828
You sent him on an errand.

18:10.930 --> 18:12.396
Where did you send him?

18:13.633 --> 18:15.792
You spoke with him.
Why are you asking me?

18:15.802 --> 18:18.887
It's his alibi. I can't
just take his word for it.

18:20.173 --> 18:22.420
It was a party, I wanted to relax,

18:22.430 --> 18:23.908
and I didn't need supervision.

18:28.648 --> 18:29.814
Hey.

18:29.916 --> 18:32.549
Liam. Just the man I was looking for.

18:32.796 --> 18:35.486
Look, go get my car,
go to the liquor store...

18:35.588 --> 18:38.496
Fill this up, okay?

18:38.506 --> 18:42.159
- Okay.
- My keys are in my office, all right?

18:42.228 --> 18:44.495
But be discreet.

18:46.032 --> 18:47.164
Thank you.

18:49.402 --> 18:52.744
You said Kate would get hurt if
she didn't mind her own business.

18:53.106 --> 18:54.713
I wanted a drink.

18:54.723 --> 18:56.142
I didn't mean that.

18:56.152 --> 18:59.611
And yet, less than a half an
hour later, she was murdered.

19:00.813 --> 19:03.447
If you haven't noticed, I'm a drinker.

19:03.516 --> 19:06.117
I drink too much,
and then I talk too much,

19:06.219 --> 19:07.685
but that's all that it is... Talk.

19:07.787 --> 19:11.322
You can ask anybody.
I mean, no one takes me seriously.

19:11.390 --> 19:14.179
Everyone holds Eric in such high regard.

19:14.189 --> 19:17.669
Must be painful living in
the shadow of your brother.

19:18.559 --> 19:20.464
I said something that I didn't mean.

19:20.566 --> 19:21.699
And then you went up on the roof

19:21.767 --> 19:23.067
and you did something you didn't mean?

19:23.136 --> 19:25.412
- That didn't happen.
- Maybe you don't remember.

19:25.422 --> 19:27.705
You wouldn't be the first guy
to tell me he blacked out

19:27.773 --> 19:28.839
after a night of drinking.

19:28.908 --> 19:30.841
Kate was the only person
in my whole family

19:30.910 --> 19:32.243
who sent my wife a birthday card.

19:32.311 --> 19:34.269
She treated me and Melanie with respect,

19:34.279 --> 19:36.744
treated me better than
half of my own blood!

19:36.754 --> 19:38.816
There isn't enough booze in the world

19:38.885 --> 19:41.785
that could make me forget that.

19:41.888 --> 19:43.633
I didn't kill her.

19:44.338 --> 19:46.267
Get the hell out of my office!

20:16.803 --> 20:18.715
Greg, I thought that was you.

20:19.649 --> 20:22.726
I'm Eric, Greg's brother-in-law.

20:25.486 --> 20:27.010
I'm running late.

20:27.354 --> 20:28.949
We'll talk later.

20:35.131 --> 20:37.963
Hey, your phone's off. Are you in court?

20:38.065 --> 20:39.998
Call me back.

20:44.771 --> 20:46.146
Sorry.

20:46.156 --> 20:50.075
I'm still waiting for that juvie
file you promised, counselor.

20:51.878 --> 20:53.445
As far as I'm concerned,

20:53.513 --> 20:56.643
- it's innocent until proven guilty.
- I appreciate that.

20:56.653 --> 20:59.687
The other potential buyers,
they have nice things to say,

20:59.789 --> 21:02.724
but I know as soon as I sign,
they'll lay everybody off

21:02.792 --> 21:06.227
and start selling the
company off piece by piece.

21:06.626 --> 21:10.164
Well, I can only speak
to S.E.G.'s intentions.

21:10.267 --> 21:14.369
The other guys say that your firm
doesn't make the profits they do.

21:14.471 --> 21:15.637
We don't.

21:17.307 --> 21:19.874
Can I trust a man who tells me
he doesn't care about profits?

21:22.167 --> 21:24.452
There was a time when it
was all I cared about.

21:24.462 --> 21:27.817
After business school, I worked
in commodities... Sweet Racket.

21:27.827 --> 21:30.007
Didn't matter if the client won or lost.

21:30.157 --> 21:33.294
Either way, we took our commissions.

21:34.024 --> 21:35.723
Great week.

21:35.825 --> 21:37.458
Nice.

21:37.560 --> 21:39.894
Mm. Ahh!

21:39.996 --> 21:41.296
Ah! Another one.

21:41.398 --> 21:42.797
You sell out of all your roses?

21:43.900 --> 21:45.025
Can I help you?

21:45.035 --> 21:48.102
- You have no idea who I am.
- Should I?

21:48.171 --> 21:50.772
I gave you my money to invest,
and now it's gone.

21:50.874 --> 21:52.140
Well, yeah, listen,

21:52.242 --> 21:55.276
I-I never apologize for trying
to make my clients money.

21:55.345 --> 21:57.569
Investing is always a risk.

21:58.353 --> 22:00.347
Don't take it personal, old man.

22:00.690 --> 22:02.817
- Here we go.
- That money was personal.

22:02.886 --> 22:05.119
$82,750.

22:05.221 --> 22:08.056
I busted my back for
35 years to make it,

22:08.066 --> 22:09.416
and you lost it in a day.

22:09.426 --> 22:11.626
And I make that in a day.

22:11.695 --> 22:14.162
My savings, retirement, my future.

22:14.230 --> 22:17.530
I'm 63 years old. What am I
supposed to tell my family?

22:24.573 --> 22:26.062
Shame on you.

22:28.732 --> 22:30.678
Get out of here.

22:37.419 --> 22:40.621
Suddenly, I began to understand
all my father's speeches.

22:40.690 --> 22:44.392
"Work hard. Give back.
Take nothing for granted."

22:44.494 --> 22:47.128
And I was ashamed.

22:47.230 --> 22:48.798
The next day I quit

22:48.808 --> 22:51.733
and begged my father to give me a shot.

22:55.563 --> 23:00.341
You know, the others say that, uh,
S.E.G. is a... A turnaround shop

23:00.410 --> 23:02.176
like that's some kind of an insult.

23:02.245 --> 23:04.349
I'm not familiar with that term.

23:04.684 --> 23:08.816
We buy companies and turn them around
and make them profitable again.

23:08.885 --> 23:11.760
They buy companies to strip the carcass.

23:12.289 --> 23:14.555
Ours costs more and takes longer.

23:14.624 --> 23:18.559
To them, it is an insult.
To us, it's a point of pride.

23:20.330 --> 23:22.397
I'm e-mailing you a full list

23:22.499 --> 23:24.432
of S.E.G. controlled partnerships.

23:24.501 --> 23:26.467
They can tell you better than I can

23:26.536 --> 23:28.836
what it's like to have
S.E.G. as a partner.

23:28.938 --> 23:30.738
We want what you want, Frank...

23:30.840 --> 23:32.306
To save Soica.

23:34.194 --> 23:36.779
- Thanks for your time.
- Thanks.

23:43.995 --> 23:45.518
_

23:57.340 --> 23:59.516
Yeah, I need to talk to you.

23:59.526 --> 24:00.735
Yes, now.

24:07.074 --> 24:08.643
I got a surgery in 10 minutes.

24:08.745 --> 24:10.645
- Who is she?
- That's none of your damn business.

24:10.713 --> 24:11.879
You're married to my sister.

24:11.948 --> 24:14.282
- Then talk to her.
- I'm talking to you!

24:17.773 --> 24:19.342
I moved out.

24:19.650 --> 24:20.855
Months ago.

24:23.201 --> 24:25.426
You know, your family...

24:26.068 --> 24:28.191
You all think you're so close,

24:28.367 --> 24:31.267
but none of you ever
really talk to each other.

24:33.247 --> 24:35.403
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

24:36.739 --> 24:40.089
Anything else you need to know,
you talk to your sister.

24:42.086 --> 24:44.912
Hey! I got bad news.

24:47.427 --> 24:50.651
- How the hell did you find me?
- It'll come to you.

24:54.581 --> 24:56.898
Can't believe Patrick blew
off that Soica meeting, man.

24:56.908 --> 24:58.059
How'd it go?

24:58.161 --> 25:00.795
- You cloned my phone?
- Yeah, and they let the kid out early.

25:00.897 --> 25:03.673
- So we missed him?
- Not exactly.

25:03.683 --> 25:06.501
You comin'?

25:17.730 --> 25:21.056
There's a couple of
potholes you missed back there.

25:21.066 --> 25:22.453
We could always go back.

25:22.521 --> 25:23.988
Hey.

25:24.090 --> 25:27.891
We just crossed the county line.
You know what that means?

25:29.822 --> 25:31.095
Hey.

25:31.649 --> 25:33.564
Liam v... Hey. Psst!

25:34.187 --> 25:38.682
Liam violated the terms
of his bail, okay?

25:38.692 --> 25:42.222
If Billy found out, man,
he'd revoke his bond

25:42.232 --> 25:44.696
and take little Liam's
ass right back to jail.

25:44.765 --> 25:47.143
So? I mean, he'd just post bond again.

25:47.153 --> 25:48.719
No, not if there's evidence that...

25:48.788 --> 25:50.521
That he intended to skip and evade.

25:51.287 --> 25:53.958
Okay, then he'd be
considered a flight risk...

25:54.060 --> 25:55.693
No bail, no bail.

25:55.762 --> 25:57.595
He just sits in jail till the trial,

25:57.697 --> 26:00.398
where he's looking at
five years minimum.

26:00.467 --> 26:03.334
I-I know you're trying to tell me
something. I'm just not sure what.

26:03.369 --> 26:05.002
It's okay. It'll come to you.

26:05.105 --> 26:06.070
Okay, look.

26:06.139 --> 26:07.939
This guy's not just some punk, okay?

26:08.007 --> 26:09.674
He's not gonna answer our questions

26:09.742 --> 26:11.342
if we just come at him straight.

26:11.444 --> 26:13.578
All right. Uh, what do you suggest?

26:13.680 --> 26:15.513
We're gonna con him, okay?

26:15.582 --> 26:19.083
Just let me talk and
follow my lead, all right?

26:22.403 --> 26:26.290
Liam. It's nice to finally meet you.

26:26.300 --> 26:27.427
You know Eric,

26:27.437 --> 26:30.561
and, uh, I'm... I'm Danny,
a friend of the family.

26:31.669 --> 26:33.904
- You bailed me out?
- Nah, Eric's not ready to talk to you.

26:33.914 --> 26:36.334
Hey. You talk to me.

26:37.184 --> 26:39.470
- Why did he bail me out?
- 'Cause it was important to him

26:39.539 --> 26:43.089
that you and I have this chance
to spend some time together.

26:43.243 --> 26:44.501
Hey, hey.

26:44.511 --> 26:46.246
You got to settle a bet for us.

26:46.256 --> 26:48.913
We got 40 bucks riding on this,
man, so be honest, okay?

26:48.982 --> 26:51.616
The day that Eric and
Kate came in early,

26:51.684 --> 26:54.172
you told them about the deejay.

26:55.211 --> 26:57.607
What were you really doing?

26:57.898 --> 26:59.215
Uh, I'm... I'm sorry.

26:59.225 --> 27:00.758
I don't... I'm confused.

27:00.860 --> 27:03.127
No, you're not.

27:03.229 --> 27:05.496
I know you.

27:05.565 --> 27:07.559
I know what you did.

27:08.968 --> 27:11.269
Be straight with me...

27:11.337 --> 27:13.304
And maybe this works out for you.

27:14.354 --> 27:16.230
What were you doing?

27:21.262 --> 27:23.181
Somebody's here.

27:24.450 --> 27:25.783
Morning.

27:28.325 --> 27:32.225
I was hacking into the personal
financial info of S.E.G. investors.

27:36.135 --> 27:37.795
You can ask him now.

27:46.385 --> 27:47.786
Liam?

27:48.773 --> 27:50.676
Did you kill my wife?

27:50.958 --> 27:53.144
No. I had nothing to do with that.

27:53.246 --> 27:54.879
And how do I know you're not lying?

27:54.948 --> 27:56.180
You meet Cornell?

27:56.249 --> 27:57.515
She's a pit bull.

27:57.584 --> 27:59.116
A cop like her would've never
let me out of her house

27:59.185 --> 28:00.151
if she thought I was the killer.

28:00.286 --> 28:02.086
Then how did you convince her?

28:02.188 --> 28:04.637
I had an alibi, and she looked into it.

28:04.945 --> 28:07.058
Besides, I liked Kate.

28:16.169 --> 28:17.588
Are you...

28:19.079 --> 28:20.770
Are you her son?

28:23.731 --> 28:27.981
She gave up a baby the year that you
were born and in the town you're from,

28:28.139 --> 28:31.649
and she hired you knowing
your résumé was total B.S.

28:33.869 --> 28:35.517
Are you... Are you her son?

28:40.205 --> 28:41.806
Wow.

28:41.947 --> 28:44.282
I see you doing the math.

28:46.107 --> 28:48.833
Do I lie? Do I play the son angle?

28:52.278 --> 28:55.940
Or do I answer straight out of fear

28:56.042 --> 28:58.042
and respect for Kate?

29:00.597 --> 29:03.447
Problem is, if you guess wrong,

29:03.549 --> 29:05.182
I'm going home.

29:05.742 --> 29:07.248
And you?

29:08.221 --> 29:12.523
You get to watch Danny pull out the
plastic sheeting from the closet.

29:18.883 --> 29:20.431
I'm not her kid.

29:20.500 --> 29:22.490
I didn't even know she had one.

29:26.414 --> 29:28.272
Then why did she hire you?

29:30.063 --> 29:32.710
Thank you for meeting with me.
I really appreciate the opportunity.

29:32.812 --> 29:34.429
Well, I was really impressed.

29:34.439 --> 29:36.916
I had to meet the kid from my hometown

29:36.926 --> 29:40.318
who cooked up the best bogus
résumé I've ever read.

29:40.386 --> 29:42.398
Your references were even better.

29:42.408 --> 29:43.888
It took me three calls before I realized

29:43.956 --> 29:46.090
I was talking to the same person.

29:46.159 --> 29:50.059
A lesser mark would never catch it,
but you're very good at voices.

29:52.366 --> 29:53.931
I should go.

29:56.037 --> 29:57.445
Let me guess.

29:57.455 --> 29:59.637
You worked the boiler
rooms on route 421,

29:59.706 --> 30:01.505
cold-calling local hillfolk,

30:01.574 --> 30:04.491
asking for cash for
fictional missionary work?

30:07.022 --> 30:08.412
For two years.

30:08.448 --> 30:11.182
I was 15. I needed to eat.

30:11.614 --> 30:12.983
Sorry.

30:13.052 --> 30:15.115
What are you really doing here?

30:19.576 --> 30:21.792
- Looking for a job.
- Doing what?

30:21.861 --> 30:24.295
Anything. I want to go straight.

30:24.397 --> 30:26.615
You picked me because I'm from Boone.

30:26.809 --> 30:29.223
Yeah. And there's no cash here.

30:29.884 --> 30:32.250
You don't want to create
temptation for yourself.

30:32.260 --> 30:34.660
I'm tired of looking over my shoulder.

30:39.819 --> 30:42.867
Look, I've done things
that I'm not proud of.

30:42.877 --> 30:44.515
People got hurt.

30:45.299 --> 30:47.526
But I told myself that
I'd become a person

30:47.536 --> 30:49.645
worth the second chance
I'd stolen from them,

30:49.655 --> 30:51.455
and I am a different person now.

30:55.383 --> 30:58.329
Do you believe that, that it's possible?

30:59.596 --> 31:01.137
I want to.

31:02.373 --> 31:05.439
Well, if I did it, you can, too, right?

31:07.598 --> 31:09.206
I think so.

31:11.377 --> 31:13.771
This has to be a new life.

31:13.991 --> 31:16.739
You go straight, and you never go back.

31:16.749 --> 31:19.183
- Done.
- You're gonna have to prove yourself

31:19.252 --> 31:22.534
'cause I don't trust you yet, so
it's gonna be crap work for months.

31:22.790 --> 31:24.066
Thank you.

31:24.076 --> 31:25.589
I won't let you down.

31:25.691 --> 31:27.491
We'll see.

31:28.787 --> 31:31.796
Second chance she'd stolen in Boone?

31:31.931 --> 31:34.165
What was she talking about?

31:34.267 --> 31:35.366
I don't know.

31:35.435 --> 31:37.368
She tried to help you,
and you lied to her!

31:37.470 --> 31:40.675
No, I didn't. Look,
I meant everything that I said,

31:40.685 --> 31:43.841
and I really did try.
I really did. I just...

31:43.910 --> 31:46.310
When I saw how easy it was...
There was so much money.

31:46.320 --> 31:49.878
What's your alibi, huh?
What did you tell Cornell?

31:50.195 --> 31:52.978
I told her where I was when
Kate went off the building.

32:02.628 --> 32:03.928
I went straight to the liquor store.

32:03.996 --> 32:06.167
The... the cops pulled
the surveillance footage.

32:06.177 --> 32:07.164
I-I couldn't have killed Kate.

32:07.233 --> 32:09.733
She knew you were stealing!
You had a motive!

32:09.802 --> 32:12.002
- If it wasn't you, then who?
- You want to hurry this up?

32:12.012 --> 32:13.404
Who?! Who was it?!

32:13.506 --> 32:15.710
Uh... who would've killed her,
Liam? Who would've killed her?!

32:15.720 --> 32:19.420
- Do you know about the bank statement?
- What bank statement?!

32:19.545 --> 32:21.202
What bank statement?

32:21.801 --> 32:23.914
It came in the mail.
It was an S.E.G. account

32:23.924 --> 32:25.734
that was linked to a bank that
Kate didn't know anything about,

32:25.744 --> 32:26.826
and it freaked her out.

32:26.836 --> 32:29.620
It was the only work document that
she kept in her desk, locked away.

32:29.722 --> 32:31.047
I think it had something
to do with Neil.

32:31.057 --> 32:34.207
She... she started to look
into all of his accounts.

32:36.262 --> 32:37.728
I didn't see it in the desk,

32:37.830 --> 32:39.296
but the... but...
but the lock was broken.

32:39.398 --> 32:40.631
They must've stolen it.

32:40.733 --> 32:42.766
Okay, so you're saying that
someone else at S.E.G. is dirty.

32:42.869 --> 32:44.101
Yeah, yeah, that's what he's saying.

32:44.203 --> 32:46.570
Look, is this the woman you
saw with Neil in the garage?

32:46.672 --> 32:47.976
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

32:47.986 --> 32:49.246
Where were they going?

32:49.256 --> 32:51.675
Th... they weren't leaving...
At least Neil wasn't.

32:51.777 --> 32:53.312
How do you know?

33:04.599 --> 33:06.824
Hey! Have you ever met her?

33:06.926 --> 33:10.227
That's you! That's my
daughter! She's missing!

33:10.329 --> 33:11.629
I-I saw her at the game,
but we barely spoke.

33:11.731 --> 33:13.397
- What did she say?
- Uh, uh, nothing.

33:13.499 --> 33:16.899
- Who did she come with?!
- Uh, Neil. She came with Neil.

33:17.236 --> 33:20.433
- Rachel came with Neil?
- Son of a bitch!

33:20.443 --> 33:22.339
Danny!

33:25.558 --> 33:27.449
- Danny, wait.
- Neil knows Carly, and he knows

33:27.459 --> 33:29.252
my daughter. Man,
I'm gonna find out where she is.

33:29.262 --> 33:31.184
- Okay, how? How?
- You know how.

33:31.194 --> 33:32.694
Exactly. Let's just figure this out.

33:32.762 --> 33:34.796
The only thing that
you need to figure out

33:34.864 --> 33:37.465
is that your friend is not only
a liar but possibly a killer.

33:37.567 --> 33:39.234
Neil is a lot of things,
but he is not...

33:39.336 --> 33:41.436
Did you hear what that kid
said about the bank statement

33:41.538 --> 33:43.429
and about seeing Neil in his office

33:43.439 --> 33:45.448
right after your wife was killed?

33:45.836 --> 33:48.611
He had motive and opportunity.

33:52.809 --> 33:55.049
- I'll come with you.
- You still have to deal with Liam.

33:56.519 --> 33:57.752
What am I supposed to do with him?

33:57.854 --> 33:59.287
It'll come to you.

34:16.126 --> 34:18.539
I just bought you a bus ticket.

34:19.266 --> 34:20.563
Thank you.

34:21.208 --> 34:22.754
You deserve it.

34:28.495 --> 34:31.320
Billy? Eric Warner.

34:31.330 --> 34:34.054
Yeah, we found Liam out
here in Gaston county

34:34.065 --> 34:38.570
with a... bus ticket to
Dallas in his pocket.

34:38.672 --> 34:40.168
I agree.

34:40.926 --> 34:42.467
Definitely a flight risk.

34:44.077 --> 34:48.002
We're at the motel out on 27,
just past the county line.

34:49.138 --> 34:50.504
Come and get him.

35:01.146 --> 35:03.243
You're gonna sit in jail

35:03.366 --> 35:06.631
until you go to trial for
taking that woman's farm.

35:07.547 --> 35:09.239
And when they try you,

35:09.249 --> 35:11.336
you're gonna plead guilty

35:11.405 --> 35:14.606
and take that
five-year-minimum sentence.

35:16.177 --> 35:17.609
Screw you.

35:21.831 --> 35:23.575
If you don't,

35:24.324 --> 35:27.719
I'm turning you in for
what you did at S.E.G.

35:30.591 --> 35:32.488
It'd destroy the firm.

35:33.603 --> 35:34.907
Yep.

35:36.365 --> 35:38.730
But the company is mine.

35:41.003 --> 35:43.064
And my wife is dead.

35:46.139 --> 35:47.335
But you...

35:48.331 --> 35:50.313
You're gonna get 40 years.

35:54.476 --> 35:56.715
So I'm okay with that.

36:04.161 --> 36:07.411
She gave you a chance
you didn't deserve,

36:07.421 --> 36:09.482
and you took advantage of her.

36:11.107 --> 36:13.847
Enjoy the next five years scumbag...

36:23.744 --> 36:24.843
Where's Neil?

36:24.945 --> 36:27.058
He finally closed the deal.

36:27.622 --> 36:29.681
I'll give you one guess.

36:32.362 --> 36:33.728
Good night.

36:39.055 --> 36:41.813
Now who's not answering their phone?

36:44.183 --> 36:47.232
I heard you had a
conversation with Greg.

36:49.133 --> 36:50.429
Yeah, I'm sorry.

36:50.712 --> 36:51.927
For what?

36:51.937 --> 36:53.146
That you're going through this.

36:53.215 --> 36:55.015
You've been so busy helping me.

36:55.117 --> 36:57.317
I've been so focused on myself.

36:57.386 --> 36:59.486
I didn't even notice.

36:59.555 --> 37:02.622
I'm sorry I made you feel
like you couldn't tell me.

37:02.724 --> 37:05.158
I couldn't tell anyone.

37:05.620 --> 37:06.906
Why?

37:10.713 --> 37:14.301
It's a long story that I don't
really want to get into.

37:16.138 --> 37:20.006
But when I do, you'll be the first.

37:22.320 --> 37:25.745
Listen, I'm gonna be a better
brother to you, Mandy.

37:25.814 --> 37:27.781
I'm supposed to have your back.

37:27.883 --> 37:32.152
Well, from the way
Greg told it, you did.

37:33.488 --> 37:34.808
Yeah.

37:36.161 --> 37:38.296
Please don't tell anyone.

37:39.530 --> 37:42.162
Tell anyone? About what?

37:48.422 --> 37:50.437
Always did have my back.

38:05.443 --> 38:09.089
Hey, man. Figured I'd find you here.

38:09.428 --> 38:12.025
Huh, you still came?

38:13.704 --> 38:17.931
Just wanted to congratulate
you on closing the steelworkers union.

38:19.108 --> 38:20.988
Thank you?

38:20.998 --> 38:24.437
- Well, it took you long enough.
- Oh, screw you. I want a raise.

38:26.813 --> 38:29.709
- How about a ride instead?
- Oh, I'm still celebrating.

38:29.719 --> 38:32.150
Oh, no, I got better booze at the loft.

38:32.987 --> 38:35.281
- Really?
- Go back and play some "Madden."

38:35.350 --> 38:36.735
- "Madden"?
- Oh, yeah.

38:36.745 --> 38:39.027
Oh. I would love to.

38:39.037 --> 38:41.114
- Let's do it.
- See what you can do.

38:41.124 --> 38:41.955
- Oh, yeah.
- All right.

38:42.024 --> 38:43.757
- Just like old times, huh?
- Yeah.

38:49.597 --> 38:51.364
He's all yours.

38:51.837 --> 38:53.900
- Who is?
- I wasn't talking to you.

38:53.969 --> 38:56.469
Oh! God! What the hell?!

38:56.479 --> 38:58.171
You lied to me about that girl.

38:58.273 --> 39:00.240
- What girl?
- You know what girl.

39:00.342 --> 39:01.975
You took her to the damn party.

39:02.077 --> 39:03.710
- Say her name.
- Oh!

39:03.812 --> 39:05.545
C-Carly. It's Carly.

39:05.647 --> 39:07.847
What about her friend Rachel?

39:07.949 --> 39:09.382
You remember her?

39:09.451 --> 39:12.078
You took her and Carly
to the Skybox, huh?

39:12.088 --> 39:13.953
I-I think so. I think so.

39:14.022 --> 39:15.955
It's... it's Carly's friend.

39:16.024 --> 39:17.024
Ohh!

39:19.461 --> 39:22.744
- You don't want to do this.
- Kate is dead. Why are you lying?

39:23.465 --> 39:25.331
It's his daughter, man!
He's gonna hurt you!

39:25.400 --> 39:27.567
I can't help you unless
you tell him the truth.

39:28.878 --> 39:31.404
Y-your daughter was just there, okay?

39:31.473 --> 39:34.574
Carly was my date to the
party and to the Skybox.

39:35.398 --> 39:38.144
So why would you lie about that?

39:38.246 --> 39:40.867
I screwed Carly in my
car at a company party.

39:40.877 --> 39:42.515
I didn't want to lose my job.

39:42.617 --> 39:44.851
And... and... and I didn't
want to get in trouble

39:44.861 --> 39:46.332
with her people.

39:48.256 --> 39:49.789
What?

39:52.794 --> 39:54.262
She's a pro.

39:54.791 --> 39:55.929
Yeah.

39:56.031 --> 39:58.965
Yeah, Carly's a call girl.

40:00.184 --> 40:02.235
Aaah! Ugh!

40:02.337 --> 40:04.170
Ohh.

40:05.172 --> 40:06.706
You better hope she answers.

40:09.111 --> 40:10.977
The mobile number
you are trying to reach

40:10.987 --> 40:13.580
has been disconnected or
is no longer in service.

40:16.318 --> 40:18.168
Expecting somebody?

40:21.798 --> 40:25.024
I'm so sorry. I just didn't
want you to judge me.

40:25.034 --> 40:27.234
