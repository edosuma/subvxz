WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:07.040 --> 00:10.043
We're back. And things are about
to get fucking naughty.

00:11.945 --> 00:15.548
It's going to be bigger
and better than ever before.

00:15.615 --> 00:18.184
(all cheer)
(all) Cheers!

00:18.251 --> 00:20.854
More kissing.
Getting fucked up.

00:22.055 --> 00:24.424
Tears.
(sobbing)

00:24.491 --> 00:26.192
Arguing.
(yelling)

00:27.694 --> 00:29.129
(screams)

00:29.195 --> 00:31.798
(sobs)
Bring it on.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.767
Hi, everyone.

00:33.833 --> 00:34.868
What?

00:34.934 --> 00:39.739
Charlotte's telling wor she's broke
up with Mitch, this is big news.

00:39.806 --> 00:42.375
Charlotte's all over Gary
like a cheap suit.

00:43.910 --> 00:45.779
What the fuck is going on?

00:45.845 --> 00:49.983
Me and Charlotte necking on,
never seen that coming(!)

00:50.049 --> 00:52.385
Why should I clean
that shit-hole up?

00:53.553 --> 00:56.289
Being team leader proper sucks cock.
Fuck off then.

00:57.157 --> 01:01.327
Vicky's saying I've gotta stay in
till the kitchen's clean. Bothered?

01:05.999 --> 01:09.269
I look at her in the eyes
and lie and it didn't bother us.

01:10.970 --> 01:13.139
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

01:13.206 --> 01:15.308
I am a Geordie girl with a VIP edge.

01:15.375 --> 01:17.744
I'm a natural beauty,
real boobs, real hair.

01:17.811 --> 01:19.813
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:19.879 --> 01:22.048
I'd never kiss anyone
without a six pack.

01:22.115 --> 01:26.019
The hardest graft I do is my hair.
I'm colourful and full of mischief.

01:26.085 --> 01:27.854
I'm fake, flirty, I've got FFs.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.457
I'm gonna get everyone feisty.

01:30.523 --> 01:33.126
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

01:44.204 --> 01:47.607
Things actually must be going well
between Marnie and Aaron

01:47.674 --> 01:51.744
because Marnie is in Aaron's bed.
I just hope something happened.

01:51.811 --> 01:54.047
Nothing happened last night.
Nothing?

01:54.113 --> 01:56.015
Nothing, not even a kiss.

01:56.850 --> 01:59.152
No. Didn't even touch us.

02:05.325 --> 02:09.095
The lads are taking the piss
because nothing happened last night,

02:09.162 --> 02:13.466
but I like that he's taking it slow,
it makes us like him more.

02:13.533 --> 02:18.338
Marnie, I'm surprised you came out.
I know, but I'm not staying in.

02:18.404 --> 02:20.840
Last night Vicky told us
to clean the kitchen

02:20.907 --> 02:24.444
otherwise I wasn't allowed out,
but fuck that, she's not me mam.

02:24.511 --> 02:28.047
I done a bit and hid the rest.
Do you reckon you'll get in trouble?

02:28.114 --> 02:29.749
Did you clean?
It's fine.

02:32.051 --> 02:35.788
Oh, I didn't put them anywhere.
Where did you put them?

02:35.855 --> 02:37.790
Are you fucking kidding us?

02:40.326 --> 02:44.197
I knew this was too good to be true,
that little shrew didn't clean.

02:44.264 --> 02:46.466
Vicky's gonna be foaming
her lid off.

02:51.437 --> 02:54.007
She said this morning
when she was tidying,

02:54.073 --> 02:58.211
she couldn't be arsed to put
everything in the dishwasher

02:58.278 --> 03:01.481
so she just put all the plates,
cutlery, cups in a bin bag.

03:01.548 --> 03:04.384
I can't believe it.
Can this girl do anything right?

03:04.450 --> 03:06.286
You're fucking joking.

03:10.423 --> 03:11.758
That's lying, that.

03:11.824 --> 03:15.528
The lads have found a bag of dirty
dishes that Marnie hasn't done.

03:15.595 --> 03:18.398
Vicky is gonna go fucking off it.

03:20.934 --> 03:24.404
I'm walking downstairs to make me
breakfast and what do I find?

03:27.006 --> 03:30.610
The fucking lazy bitch
hasn't washed the dishes.

03:30.677 --> 03:32.245
Heads are gonna roll.

03:32.312 --> 03:35.848
Oh, my God. She's such a dick.

03:39.352 --> 03:41.454
Oh, why does she do this to me?

03:41.521 --> 03:45.825
Since Marnie loves her bed so much
I may as well take the dishes to her.

03:50.396 --> 03:52.932
She's found the plates. Fuck.

03:59.606 --> 04:02.775
(Scott) Shut up, man. Shut up.
(laughs)

04:02.842 --> 04:06.446
You fucking tramp.
Vicky's well over-the-top.

04:06.512 --> 04:10.450
There's no need to smash the plates
into my bed, she's out of order.

04:13.853 --> 04:18.757
Marnie's playing with the big girls,
so bring it on, bitch.

04:18.825 --> 04:21.361
High five. Well done.

04:21.427 --> 04:23.229
(phone ringing)

04:26.265 --> 04:28.167
Hello?

04:28.234 --> 04:29.235
Hiya, pet.

04:33.573 --> 04:35.942
Oh, right. We're off to Sunderland.

04:36.009 --> 04:39.545
We've got a massive Tash-On Tours
event tonight in Sunderland.

04:39.612 --> 04:42.348
It's so important so we have to
pull wor fingers out.

04:42.415 --> 04:46.619
Lads, lasses, Anna has just called

04:46.686 --> 04:50.123
and we've got work tonight...
in Sunderland.

04:50.189 --> 04:51.691
Yay!

04:51.758 --> 04:55.094
Tonight we've got a job in
Sunderland, where I was born,

04:55.161 --> 04:58.097
where I was raised
and where I misbehaved.

04:58.164 --> 05:00.767
This is gonna be lethal.

05:04.570 --> 05:07.807
One thing everybody knows is
Geordies don't like Mackems,

05:07.874 --> 05:10.510
so let's have a night out
in Sunderland, great(!)

05:13.279 --> 05:16.149
We're looking fresh to death,
gonna hit Sunderland,

05:16.215 --> 05:19.385
ready for work,
tonight is gonna go off.

05:27.960 --> 05:30.797
We're in Sunderland,
this is Charlotte's hometown,

05:30.863 --> 05:32.398
we're gonna smash it.

05:32.465 --> 05:35.001
Oi, oi!
Hello, everyone.

05:35.068 --> 05:38.204
Everyone bangs on about
this rivalry.

05:38.271 --> 05:42.241
For me it's just a new city to go
to, to get smashed and find fanny.

05:42.308 --> 05:44.110
What a belter.

05:45.044 --> 05:47.647
First thing's first,
get the shots out.

05:53.152 --> 05:58.424
Can I get everyone in two lines.
Boy-girl, boy-girl, OK?

05:58.491 --> 05:59.826
Playing the ice cube game

05:59.892 --> 06:03.429
and I obviously position
myself between the fittest girls.

06:03.496 --> 06:06.399
It's not like I'm gonna stand
in between two blokes.

06:06.466 --> 06:09.769
Go!
Go, go, go!

06:14.574 --> 06:16.075
(cheers)

06:23.916 --> 06:27.453
I'm all over this bird at the bar
and she has her hand down my pants.

06:27.520 --> 06:30.590
It's all right, she's only
checking what I'm smuggling.

06:33.493 --> 06:37.063
Oh, my. Wowzers.

06:37.130 --> 06:38.965
Aaron.
Yes?

06:39.031 --> 06:41.601
I'm gonna pure blast her out later.

06:43.436 --> 06:44.504
Can do.

06:44.570 --> 06:48.407
So I'm canning on with this bird
and Aaron asks for a threesome.

06:48.474 --> 06:50.843
Go on, lad,
I didn't think you had it in you.

06:50.910 --> 06:53.679
I thought you were
bird-bound with Marnie.

06:56.749 --> 06:58.751
Wicked!

07:03.456 --> 07:07.093
Yeah. Scotty walks out and tells us
that he's got something to say,

07:07.160 --> 07:09.829
but I've gotta pinky promise
I won't kick off.

07:09.896 --> 07:11.564
This isn't gonna be good news.

07:17.236 --> 07:18.337
Aaron did?

07:18.404 --> 07:22.375
Aaron's offered a girl a threesome.
What the fuck is wrong with him?

07:22.441 --> 07:25.945
After everything he's done you'd
think he'd give up doing this.

07:26.012 --> 07:30.850
You do know that I'm gonna
fucking kick off with Aaron.

07:30.917 --> 07:33.085
I'm gonna kick off
and say Scott told us.

07:33.152 --> 07:35.988
I walk over to Aaron
to confront him.

07:36.055 --> 07:39.458
I'm not putting up with this
and he's not getting away with it.

07:39.525 --> 07:43.663
You asked a girl for a threesome
as soon as I left the fucking place.

07:43.729 --> 07:46.199
It was a joke, it was a joke.
A joke?

07:46.265 --> 07:50.369
It wasn't a joke, Aaron.
I don't do that, you do.

07:50.436 --> 07:53.840
I can't even look at another girl
without Marnie kicking off.

07:53.906 --> 07:57.176
The threesome stuff was just a joke
and Scott knew that.

07:57.243 --> 08:01.781
(Holly) Right, stop arguing.
There's no need to play these games.

08:01.848 --> 08:05.885
OK, Aaron, if you wanna ask girls
for threesomes, be my guest,

08:05.952 --> 08:09.422
but I'll do what I know will piss
you off more than anything,

08:09.488 --> 08:10.590
flirt with Scott.

08:17.463 --> 08:20.266
I can't believe
Scott and Marnie are flirting.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.935
I thought he was me mate
but he's not, he's a snake.

08:26.005 --> 08:29.542
I hear Scott tell Marnie that
they've got unfinished business,

08:29.609 --> 08:30.843
are you having a laugh?

08:32.611 --> 08:35.847
I can see Scott and Marnie getting
very flirty and very close.

08:35.914 --> 08:38.317
I don't know what Scott's playing at.

08:38.384 --> 08:40.285
Don't play with her.

08:40.352 --> 08:43.289
You've just been
fucking cracking on with her.

08:44.590 --> 08:46.525
That's what he wants.
That's fine.

08:46.592 --> 08:51.430
Scott's not getting away with this,
this time I caught him in the act.

08:52.398 --> 08:56.202
What's all this shit?
Why've you been saying this shit?

08:56.269 --> 08:58.571
What?
Unfinished business.

08:58.638 --> 09:01.707
I'm talking to Gaz and
Aaron pure launches himself at us.

09:01.774 --> 09:03.242
What is this kid's problem?

09:03.309 --> 09:06.379
(arguing, screaming)

09:06.445 --> 09:09.181
This prick
deserves everything he gets.

09:09.248 --> 09:13.319
Aaron, I've got your fucking back,
don't you fucking insult me!

09:13.386 --> 09:14.854
Fucking what?!

09:14.921 --> 09:17.156
He needs to calm down
before I make him.

09:17.223 --> 09:19.125
This has went too far.

09:20.493 --> 09:22.762
He's not gonna stop no-one.

09:22.828 --> 09:25.898
He needs to fuck off, the
more I see him the angrier I get.

09:25.965 --> 09:29.135
Fucking little mug,
you're not gonna stop no-one.

09:29.201 --> 09:31.704
He needs to stop acting
like a fucking bitch.

09:31.771 --> 09:34.540
He's blown all of this
way out of proportion.

09:34.607 --> 09:36.709
He's making himself look a tit.

09:36.776 --> 09:39.612
Fucking hell.

09:39.679 --> 09:41.414
Grow some fucking balls!

09:42.748 --> 09:46.085
Aaron explodes into the club,
his sights set on Scotty T.

09:47.320 --> 09:48.454
Fuck this prick.

09:49.288 --> 09:52.858
(screams)
I'm pissed and I'm so fucking angry.

09:52.925 --> 09:56.696
What the fuck is wrong with us?
Shit is gonna hit the fan.

09:56.762 --> 10:01.233
Me and Gary are gonna have sex,
my fanny is so worried.

10:02.268 --> 10:04.770
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

10:07.006 --> 10:07.206
.

10:09.709 --> 10:09.909
.

10:17.383 --> 10:19.518
After everything kicking off at work,

10:19.585 --> 10:22.989
me and the lasses just wanna have
a dance, a drink and chill out

10:23.055 --> 10:26.492
and by the time Aaron gets here
he might have calmed down.

10:35.001 --> 10:37.837
So we're in the club
and Aaron is naewhere to be seen.

10:37.903 --> 10:42.274
I'm not looking for round two,
I just want to sort this shit out.

10:44.877 --> 10:47.513
Let's go to the club, hey?

10:48.414 --> 10:51.817
Work's been horrendous, my best
mate has fucked us over again

10:51.884 --> 10:54.954
and if I see Scott
I won't be able to hold back.

10:58.424 --> 11:01.293
We walk in
and I can't believe what I'm seeing.

11:01.360 --> 11:03.963
He's all over Marnie again.
Fuck this prick.

11:07.967 --> 11:09.301
What the fuck is going on?

11:09.368 --> 11:12.805
Aaron's back and he's getting
in my face. Calm your knickers.

11:17.276 --> 11:20.479
Before I get a chance to get
to Scott I'm being pulled away.

11:20.546 --> 11:23.082
That kid wants
to count himself lucky.

11:23.149 --> 11:27.620
(yelling, screaming)

11:27.686 --> 11:31.424
I don't know what is going
through this kid's head.

11:31.490 --> 11:34.326
He needs to get out of here
before I go fucking akker.

11:42.735 --> 11:45.004
Aaron obviously hasn't calmed down

11:45.071 --> 11:49.108
and he obviously still wants to knock
Scotty T's head off his shoulders,

11:49.175 --> 11:52.044
so I'm obviously gonna be
taking him home.

12:06.125 --> 12:10.229
Aaron's done off home, hopefully now
we can actually have a good night.

12:13.065 --> 12:15.534
With Holly, right,
the harder she plays to get

12:15.601 --> 12:19.071
is the more I wanna get into her,
it just makes us more determined.

12:22.708 --> 12:25.010
I know I said
I didn't wanna kiss Kyle,

12:25.077 --> 12:27.146
I didn't wanna go
anywhere near him,

12:27.213 --> 12:29.949
but I do fancy him
and I can't help myself.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.289
Thank fuck Aaron's gone home.

12:37.356 --> 12:39.758
I hope the kid calms down,
sorts his head out

12:39.825 --> 12:41.794
and stops acting
like a fucking dick.

12:47.600 --> 12:51.537
Scott's trying to explain his story,
but I already know Aaron's story.

12:51.604 --> 12:54.974
I'm trying to stay neutral,
but this time Scott is in the wrong.

13:01.680 --> 13:04.783
Me and Marnie do have
unfinished business.

13:04.850 --> 13:08.587
We went through a lot,
but I never actually banged her.

13:16.595 --> 13:19.932
We get back to the house and there's
still no calming me down.

13:19.999 --> 13:23.469
The more I think about it
the more fucked off I get.

13:27.306 --> 13:29.241
I'm mortal and absolutely raging.

13:29.308 --> 13:33.779
Let's go to town,
I fucking wanna go.

13:33.846 --> 13:36.815
All I want is Scott to come home
and admit what he's done.

13:36.882 --> 13:39.451
The longer he leaves it
the worse it's gonna get.

13:41.253 --> 13:45.324
Everyone's smashed, I can hardly see.
Look, it's time to go home.

13:49.828 --> 13:54.099
In the cab there's me and Scott,
Holly and Kyle and Charlotte and Gaz

13:54.166 --> 13:57.703
and I think we're all getting
a little bit carried away.

13:57.770 --> 14:00.105
I don't know what's in
the Sunderland air.

14:00.172 --> 14:03.008
One minute it's kicking off,
the next this taxi ride

14:03.075 --> 14:05.678
has turned into a giant
fucking orgy.

14:09.548 --> 14:12.084
After the way Aaron's went on with
me tonight,

14:12.151 --> 14:13.886
I'm pissed and fucking angry,

14:13.953 --> 14:16.956
so nothing will stop me
having a laugh with Marnie.

14:20.392 --> 14:24.396
I've ended up kissing Scott,
what the fuck is wrong with us?

14:24.463 --> 14:28.067
When Aaron finds out about this,
shit is gonna hit the fan.

14:31.370 --> 14:33.572
Aaron.
You've gotta calm down, please.

14:33.639 --> 14:36.408
Because he's going to come in.
Well, get him in then.

14:36.475 --> 14:39.411
He's a fucking mug,
he's a fucking little fucking rat.

14:39.478 --> 14:42.948
Little posh rat, mate.
His fucking hair's shit as well.

14:43.015 --> 14:45.050
His hair's shit, he's fucking ugly.

14:45.117 --> 14:46.919
I'll knock him out.
Two choices.

14:46.986 --> 14:49.488
We can go to bed and chill out
or you can go home.

14:49.555 --> 14:53.525
At this point I don't care who's
to blame or who's in the wrong,

14:53.592 --> 14:57.162
all I care about is that Aaron's
drunk and he needs to go home.

14:57.229 --> 15:00.499
I've got you a taxi coming,
is that OK?

15:00.566 --> 15:01.767
Tonight's been shit.

15:01.834 --> 15:05.204
My mate and the girl I'm getting
with have stabbed us in the back,

15:05.271 --> 15:06.639
why would I wanna stay?

15:15.347 --> 15:17.583
Marnie and Scott are
asking for trouble

15:17.650 --> 15:20.085
and really one of us
should be stopping them,

15:20.152 --> 15:22.288
but everyone's having
such a good time

15:22.354 --> 15:24.890
and I'm far too drunk
to stop anyone.

15:42.274 --> 15:45.144
I stumble in
and realise that Aaron isn't there.

15:45.210 --> 15:49.248
That's good, he was angry at the fact
that Scott and Marnie were flirting.

15:49.315 --> 15:52.284
When he finds out they kissed
there'll be hell to pay.

15:54.320 --> 15:57.389
I get back to the house
and I am so fucking drunk,

15:57.456 --> 16:01.627
I just get myself straight to bed
and get some sleep.

16:01.694 --> 16:03.629
Tonight has been full of arguments

16:03.696 --> 16:05.898
and my best mates
are at the centre of it.

16:05.964 --> 16:07.900
Where's Charlotte?
I need a cuddle.

16:07.966 --> 16:11.370
It's been a pleasure,
an absolute pleasure.

16:14.873 --> 16:19.178
This is it. This is the moment that
me and Gary are gonna have sex

16:19.244 --> 16:21.613
for the first time
in nearly two years.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.582
Me fanny is so worried.

16:23.649 --> 16:24.917
Gary!

16:27.186 --> 16:28.887
(moaning)

16:32.491 --> 16:34.626
Tonight for me has just been weird.

16:34.693 --> 16:37.529
I went to Sunderland,
a place I'd never normally go,

16:37.596 --> 16:40.399
two of my mates got in a fight,
Scott got with Marnie,

16:40.466 --> 16:43.369
I went home, went to sleep
sucking on a nipple.

16:43.435 --> 16:44.903
What the fuck?

16:49.475 --> 16:52.444
(bed creaking, moaning)

16:58.484 --> 17:00.386
How are you this morning, Scott?

17:02.788 --> 17:04.757
It's a huge, big misunderstanding.

17:04.823 --> 17:07.492
People need to stop
taking things so seriously.

17:07.559 --> 17:09.728
The main thing was cos...

17:11.329 --> 17:14.800
I was like, "Fucking hell, mate."
But it was said as a joke.

17:14.867 --> 17:18.537
I'm team Scott.
What Scott said was pure banter.

17:18.604 --> 17:20.606
Aaron needs to stop overreacting.

17:20.672 --> 17:22.574
It was a good job he went home.

17:22.641 --> 17:25.477
I was annoyed
cos I wanted to sort things out.

17:25.544 --> 17:30.249
But in a way I was glad
because obviously he was drunk...

17:32.050 --> 17:36.555
Wait until he's sober, let him
come back and then have a chat.

17:38.624 --> 17:41.493
Are you feeling a little bit
red-faced this morning?

17:41.560 --> 17:44.062
Last night was a fucking disaster.

17:44.129 --> 17:47.199
If I pretend I don't remember,
I might get away with it.

17:47.266 --> 17:51.036
Do you not feel bad?
I can't remember what happened.

17:51.103 --> 17:54.406
Shock, Marnie doesn't remember
a thing from last night.

17:54.473 --> 17:58.977
Don't you worry, pet, Auntie Vicky's
here to remind you all about it.

17:59.044 --> 18:01.580
Did we really kiss?
Oh, aye, Marnie.

18:01.647 --> 18:04.383
I've heard it was fucking pash, like.
Pash?

18:04.450 --> 18:07.419
Pash. Necking on,
tongues, legs akimbo.

18:07.486 --> 18:10.722
Fucking hell.
Aye, mate. It wasn't PG.

18:10.789 --> 18:14.760
I keep trying to forget about last
night, but Vicky just won't let us.

18:14.827 --> 18:17.229
I can't believe I got with Scott.

18:17.296 --> 18:18.964
Grab your lady balls

18:19.031 --> 18:23.202
and fucking the minute Aaron walks
back through that door be sorry.

18:23.268 --> 18:24.336
Fuck.

18:24.403 --> 18:27.206
I feel so stupid about
what I've done last night,

18:27.272 --> 18:32.211
but this time I'm gonna stay strong
and not run away from my problems.

18:37.349 --> 18:39.284
Last night I had sex with Charlotte

18:39.351 --> 18:41.720
for the first time in
over a year and a half

18:41.787 --> 18:46.325
and we're back in the shag pad.
It's so weird how quick times change.

18:48.794 --> 18:52.564
Did you?
Why did you change your mind?

18:52.631 --> 18:55.767
Cos I'm a rebel.
(both laugh)

18:57.269 --> 19:01.573
So much happened last night
and there'll be so much tension,

19:01.640 --> 19:04.543
I can't be arsed, I wanna get out
and do something fun.

19:04.610 --> 19:08.247
I think me and you should
just fucking just do one.

19:13.552 --> 19:15.787
No, Charlotte.
Is it a date?

19:15.854 --> 19:19.291
It just means that me and you
are gonna get out of the house.

19:19.358 --> 19:21.693
This is a date,
this is 100% a date.

19:21.760 --> 19:25.297
This must mean
I am amazing at the sex.

19:25.364 --> 19:27.499
High five!

19:27.566 --> 19:30.802
OK, these are the ground rules
if we're gonna go on a date.

19:30.869 --> 19:32.838
We're not going on a date.

19:32.905 --> 19:35.607
We'll hold hands
for the duration of the date,

19:35.674 --> 19:40.445
we'll kiss at least three times
and at one point when someone says,

19:40.512 --> 19:43.649
"Oh, is this your boyfriend?"
I'll go, "Yes, it is."

19:43.715 --> 19:47.653
This is typical Charlotte, now she
thinks we're practically married.

19:47.719 --> 19:49.922
Slow down, one "date" at a time.

19:49.988 --> 19:53.692
# We're going on a date!
We're going on a date!

19:53.759 --> 19:57.863
# It's gonna be really great!
It's gonna be really great! #

19:57.930 --> 20:00.532
Do you wanna start the kissing now?
No.

20:04.269 --> 20:06.138
Last night Holly was all over us,

20:06.204 --> 20:09.508
I need to find out where her head's
at and take her for a drink.

20:11.543 --> 20:15.414
Last night was a bit crazy.
It was fucking hilarious.

20:15.480 --> 20:18.617
I know I didn't wanna neck on
with you and stuff

20:18.684 --> 20:20.886
and I said I wouldn't
go there again,

20:20.953 --> 20:24.856
but it was just a bit of fun, I was
kind of caught up in the moment.

20:24.923 --> 20:28.360
There's only so many times
you can resist someone.

20:28.427 --> 20:31.063
Holly's trying to act like
she's not too fussed,

20:31.129 --> 20:33.799
but I know she's just
trying to protect herself.

20:33.865 --> 20:38.604
So what would the craic be if I went
out and I pulled another lass now?

20:38.670 --> 20:42.007
Would you be pissed off,
or would you be OK with it?

20:42.074 --> 20:45.611
I'm thinking, "Should I play it
cool, act like I'm not bothered?"

20:45.677 --> 20:47.045
"Or tell the truth?"

20:47.112 --> 20:51.049
Probs kick off a little bit.
(both laugh)

20:52.351 --> 20:55.988
I appreciate you being honest.
So I'm on a pulling ban?

20:56.054 --> 20:57.789
No, you're not on a pulling ban,

20:57.856 --> 21:00.659
but if you do pull,
I'll chop your penis off.

21:00.726 --> 21:04.396
Just being honest.
I'm being very honest.

21:11.637 --> 21:14.439
I am so excited
for my date to begin.

21:14.506 --> 21:17.442
Get to the farm and despite
how annoying Charlotte is

21:17.509 --> 21:20.812
I think we're gonna have a good date.
This is my boyfriend.

21:20.879 --> 21:24.249
She's not, we're just friends.

21:24.316 --> 21:26.184
Already the date is going amazing.

21:26.251 --> 21:27.719
We're holding hands,

21:27.786 --> 21:30.989
I'm telling passers by
we're boyfriend and girlfriend

21:31.056 --> 21:34.359
and I can tell he's loving this.

21:36.762 --> 21:38.263
It's a cow. It's a cow, Gary.

21:50.676 --> 21:52.544
(laughs)
Nah, nah, nah.

21:52.611 --> 21:55.981
I don't like animals
and I'm not into feeding them,

21:56.048 --> 21:58.684
but if Charlotte's happy I'm happy.

22:02.788 --> 22:05.023
Wow.
It's what we'll be doing.

22:05.090 --> 22:06.958
I won't be.
Yeah, you will.

22:07.025 --> 22:10.128
You'll have to help
with the feeds as well.

22:13.732 --> 22:17.402
I've had a wicked day with Charlotte,
it's back to how it used to be.

22:17.469 --> 22:19.938
We're in a better place
than we've ever been.

22:20.005 --> 22:22.741
I would happily spend
all my time with Charlotte.

22:22.808 --> 22:24.009
Gary?
Yeah?

22:24.076 --> 22:26.712
This has been the best date ever.
(laughs)

22:31.583 --> 22:34.086
Hiya.
Holly's just got back from her date.

22:34.152 --> 22:37.089
Yes! I can't wait
to hear all about it.

22:37.155 --> 22:39.825
We've got so much
to tell each other, haven't we?

22:39.891 --> 22:42.861
I know. How was your date?
It was amazing.

22:42.928 --> 22:45.964
Was it? (laughs)
It was so good.

22:46.031 --> 22:49.000
But I think I was a bit full-on.
Oh, really?

22:49.067 --> 22:51.303
I wanted to kiss him all the time

22:51.369 --> 22:57.309
and then I said we were boyfriend
and girlfriend. He said we weren't.

22:57.375 --> 23:00.545
It's so weird hearing Charlotte
talk about her and Gary,

23:00.612 --> 23:04.783
I feel like I've gone back in time,
but she seems so happy.

23:06.685 --> 23:09.588
We just went and had
a drink and some nachos

23:09.654 --> 23:15.627
and then he was like,
"How would you feel if I pulled?"

23:15.694 --> 23:17.129
Oh, no, man.

23:23.468 --> 23:26.738
I can just see it now,
me and Kyle, Charlotte and Gary,

23:26.805 --> 23:29.107
we'll double-date
and have sleepovers.

23:29.174 --> 23:33.078
Do you wanna have an honesty minute?
Just with me and you?

23:33.145 --> 23:37.983
Right, OK. Do you get butterflies
when they walk in the room?

23:38.049 --> 23:39.618
One, two, three.
(both) Yes.

23:39.684 --> 23:42.154
(both laugh)
Oh, God.

23:44.523 --> 23:49.494
When they are gone
for more than five minutes,

23:49.561 --> 23:51.363
do you begin to miss them?

23:51.429 --> 23:53.064
One, two, three.
(both) Yes!

23:53.131 --> 23:55.167
(both laugh)
Oh, God.

23:55.233 --> 23:59.204
No-one else can know about this.
No, I know. We've gotta play cool.

24:00.205 --> 24:03.408
Shit, Aaron's just walked in,
this isn't gonna be good.

24:05.110 --> 24:07.679
Why the fuck is that ****
trying to speak to us?

24:07.746 --> 24:10.649
Oh, my God.
What the fuck am I gonna do?

24:10.715 --> 24:11.883
That's us done.

24:11.950 --> 24:15.787
I don't wanna see Scott and Marnie's
a bigger tramp than I ever thought.

24:15.854 --> 24:17.856
It's gonna go off.

24:17.923 --> 24:20.592
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

24:22.494 --> 24:22.694
.

24:25.197 --> 24:25.397
.

24:36.374 --> 24:38.777
Tonight we're minus one angry Aaron,

24:38.844 --> 24:40.946
so hopefully that means
we can go out,

24:41.012 --> 24:43.081
have fun and have a drama-free night.

24:43.148 --> 24:44.850
Cheers.
(Charlotte) Cheers.

24:48.186 --> 24:49.221
I hope so.

24:49.287 --> 24:51.489
The whole squad's out
apart from Aaron,

24:51.556 --> 24:55.193
hopefully we can leave the drama
and get off our fucking bread bins.

24:57.963 --> 25:02.968
Tonight's amazing and I look around
and everyone's so happy. Wicked!

25:18.750 --> 25:20.619
I've had a mint day today with Holly

25:20.685 --> 25:23.722
and I've been thinking
I don't wanna pull other people.

25:36.935 --> 25:39.137
So Kyle doesn't wanna pull
anyone else.

25:39.204 --> 25:43.208
Yes! Go me, go me!
He's not pulling! Oh, yeah!

25:50.949 --> 25:52.284
Kyle is so canny, man.

25:52.350 --> 25:55.787
He's told Holly that he won't
pull anyone else if he pulls her.

25:55.854 --> 25:59.090
Holly's so lucky, she's found
herself a really decent lad.

25:59.157 --> 26:01.226
Fucking well done, Kyle.

26:11.870 --> 26:13.972
I'm feeling
a little bit lonely tonight

26:14.039 --> 26:16.508
and it proves how much time
I spend with Aaron.

26:16.574 --> 26:18.109
I'm missing him a little bit.

26:24.215 --> 26:27.719
Hopefully when he comes back
we can just sort everything out.

26:34.392 --> 26:36.428
Everyone's absolutely mortal,

26:36.494 --> 26:39.164
so it's time to get back
and call it a night.

26:47.605 --> 26:51.142
We get back to the house
and everyone's in good spirits,

26:51.209 --> 26:53.878
but I'm not in the mood
without Aaron being here.

26:56.948 --> 27:00.018
Me and Holly have had the best time
with our boyfriends,

27:00.085 --> 27:04.155
but we're staying in the girls'
room, just like old times.

27:07.892 --> 27:10.762
I've had a wicked night,
but I need to get my head down

27:10.829 --> 27:14.599
because if Aaron comes back tomorrow
we have got shit to sort out.

27:21.506 --> 27:24.142
(sighs) Wicked.
Aye.

27:24.209 --> 27:26.945
It was a shame that
Aaron wasn't there last night.

27:27.012 --> 27:30.448
Hopefully today he'll come back
and this shit will get sorted.

27:30.515 --> 27:34.019
Do you reckon he'll be back today?
I fucking hope so.

27:34.085 --> 27:35.587
I need to sort things out

27:35.653 --> 27:38.490
and I wanna be the one to
speak with him before Marnie.

27:38.556 --> 27:42.293
Aaron's had time to cool off, so if
he comes back into the house today

27:42.360 --> 27:44.729
hopefully we can talk
this shit through.

27:46.598 --> 27:47.599
Nah.

27:56.574 --> 27:59.644
I went for nachos and a drink.
That's a date to me, like.

27:59.711 --> 28:03.048
The boys are taking the piss, I'm
happy to not be one of the lads.

28:03.114 --> 28:04.416
I admit it, I like Holly.

28:04.482 --> 28:07.519
I won't mug her off, I didn't
realise how much it hurt her.

28:07.585 --> 28:10.088
I was blind to that,
you know what I mean?

28:10.155 --> 28:12.190
Love is blind, son.
(chuckles)

28:16.428 --> 28:20.098
So me and Scott are eating breakfast
and we both need to figure out

28:20.165 --> 28:22.901
which one of us is gonna tell
Aaron about the kiss.

28:22.967 --> 28:26.137
Can I tell him what happened?
Can I tell him about the kiss?

28:26.204 --> 28:29.941
You gotta realise from my position,
we've been mates for a long time.

28:30.008 --> 28:31.643
I don't trust Marnie one bit.

28:31.709 --> 28:36.381
If she's the one to tell Aaron,
no doubt she'll put the blame on me.

28:36.448 --> 28:38.650
If it comes from you,
it's gonna be worse

28:38.716 --> 28:41.920
cos lads need to tell lads.
I'm getting angry about this.

28:41.986 --> 28:45.723
Why, though? I've been mates
with Aaron longer than you

28:45.790 --> 28:47.292
so it needs to come from me.

28:47.358 --> 28:50.862
If I leave it to Scott he'll just
make out none of it was his fault

28:50.929 --> 28:53.698
I wanna be the one
to tell Aaron the truth.

28:53.765 --> 28:58.837
I'm literally gonna do everything
in my ability to fix it,

28:58.903 --> 29:00.305
so just trust us, right?

29:00.371 --> 29:04.576
I wouldn't trust you as far as I
could throw you, you fucking dafty.

29:07.011 --> 29:10.882
Anna's sending me and Scott to work
today dressed as a couple of idiots

29:10.949 --> 29:12.984
to hand out flyers for
Tash-On Tours.

29:14.886 --> 29:17.222
We're the fairies of love.

29:17.288 --> 29:21.626
I could definitely find youse two
some loving, some penis action.

29:21.693 --> 29:23.695
Do you happen to be
looking for love?

29:23.761 --> 29:26.531
Yes, I think I am.
Yes, success!

29:26.598 --> 29:29.000
We have found two whole singles.

29:29.067 --> 29:31.402
You've been touched by
the arrow of love.

29:32.604 --> 29:35.340
All this love and happiness
doesn't mean anything,

29:35.406 --> 29:37.609
because if we get back
and Aaron's in,

29:37.675 --> 29:39.377
it's gonna be a world of hell.

29:39.444 --> 29:42.313
Scott better have saved
some of his arrows for Aaron.

29:47.051 --> 29:50.188
I'm going back in the house
and I'm still fucking raging.

29:50.255 --> 29:53.291
Marnie and Scott no longer exist
as far as I'm concerned.

29:53.358 --> 29:55.226
Hello.

29:55.293 --> 29:59.030
Aaron's just walked in.
Fuck, this is gonna go off.

30:00.665 --> 30:02.367
OK?
Not bad.

30:02.433 --> 30:06.171
All the lads are pleased to see us,
but Marnie doesn't even flinch.

30:06.237 --> 30:09.307
Not that I give a fuck.
You all right?

30:09.374 --> 30:13.811
Shit, Aaron's completely ignored us.
He has no idea I've kissed Scott.

30:13.878 --> 30:17.115
He's literally only angry
at us for flirting. Fuck.

30:19.050 --> 30:21.853
I'm glad Scott's not in,
I don't know if I can face him.

30:23.555 --> 30:24.556
(Gary) Coming?

30:26.925 --> 30:28.760
The lads have took Aaron upstairs.

30:28.826 --> 30:31.296
They better not tell him
what happened.

30:31.362 --> 30:34.299
I wanna be the one to tell him.
(Gary) How you feeling?

30:34.365 --> 30:36.568
Not the best, like.
(James) Still?

30:36.634 --> 30:40.638
Still fucking shaking.
Fucking angry. Angry as fuck.

30:40.705 --> 30:43.942
If they tell him,
I am going to drop-kick Gary.

30:44.008 --> 30:46.778
I'll fucking kill him.
I wanna be the one to tell him.

30:46.844 --> 30:49.981
Grab your lady balls
and go and speak to Aaron.

30:50.048 --> 30:53.184
You've kissed your way into this,
now talk your way out of it.

30:58.823 --> 31:02.694
If you'd actually say yes,
I was only joking and then...

31:02.760 --> 31:05.330
Hiya, Aaron.
All right?

31:05.396 --> 31:07.098
Can we have a little chat?
Nah.

31:07.165 --> 31:08.666
Marnie tries to talk to us.

31:08.733 --> 31:11.469
How obvious can I make it
I don't wanna talk to her?

31:11.536 --> 31:13.471
She's like a leech,
she won't let go.

31:15.406 --> 31:18.943
You don't even know what happened.
I fucking watched it happen.

31:19.010 --> 31:22.380
I was joking with Scott saying,
"Let's have a threesome."

31:22.447 --> 31:25.183
Walked from there over to you,
starts cracking on

31:25.250 --> 31:27.385
saying we've got
unfinished business.

31:27.452 --> 31:30.688
Not the way it is at all.
How isn't it?

31:30.755 --> 31:33.858
It's not.
What's "unfinished business" mean?

31:33.925 --> 31:37.562
Did I say it?
You said, "I know." I was watching.

31:37.629 --> 31:42.267
Me and Gary were watching you.
That's why I kicked off.

31:42.333 --> 31:44.869
It's all kicking off
between Aaron and Marnie

31:44.936 --> 31:48.239
and Aaron hasn't seen Scott.
I hope he took the long way home.

31:48.306 --> 31:52.143
You and Scott have got unfinished
business, so you belong together.

31:53.444 --> 31:56.247
I can't believe Aaron is
this angry over flirting,

31:56.314 --> 31:58.483
he doesn't even know about the kiss.

31:58.549 --> 32:01.085
I go downstairs
and let the lads tell him.

32:09.727 --> 32:13.398
Aaron is so angry and he doesn't
even know about the taxi yet.

32:13.464 --> 32:15.466
What is he gonna do
when he finds out?

32:15.533 --> 32:19.037
What's Scott been saying?
Trying to fucking worm his way out?

32:19.103 --> 32:20.305
More or less.

32:20.371 --> 32:24.309
Aaron's sat on the bed, all
he keeps saying is, "I'm foaming."

32:24.375 --> 32:26.277
I'm trying to pick the right moment

32:26.344 --> 32:28.646
to tell him that
they actually necked on.

32:28.713 --> 32:34.452
When you left, things got worse.
What do you mean?

32:38.923 --> 32:40.558
I've done some hard things,

32:40.625 --> 32:45.330
but telling Aaron this I am
literally stuttering and panicking,

32:45.396 --> 32:48.299
because I can see
how pissed off he's gonna be.

32:48.366 --> 32:51.602
Erm, when we got in
the taxi on the way back...

32:55.239 --> 32:57.041
You're fucking joking.

32:59.243 --> 33:01.879
So why the fuck is that ****
trying to speak to us?

33:01.946 --> 33:04.182
I can't believe
what Gary's telling us.

33:04.248 --> 33:07.518
To follow through and kiss her
is another level.

33:07.585 --> 33:09.253
Scott's a two-faced prick.

33:12.290 --> 33:14.692
Oh, yeah.
I'm gonna fucking flip, me, like.

33:14.759 --> 33:17.462
Fuck me.
Oh, my God.

33:17.528 --> 33:20.798
I've just heard Gaz tell Aaron.
What the fuck am I gonna do?

33:20.865 --> 33:23.534
No, don't, don't, don't.
Aaron, Aaron, Aaron.

33:23.601 --> 33:25.703
Why the fuck try to explain
something

33:25.770 --> 33:30.174
when you're necking on with Scott?
I was gonna tell you. She did.

33:30.241 --> 33:33.611
Why would I wanna speak to you
after what you've fucking done?

33:33.678 --> 33:36.214
My back's turned,
you neck on with Scott.

33:36.280 --> 33:41.152
Unfinished business because you're
both fucking snakes. Fucking troll.

33:42.387 --> 33:46.257
Normally in these situations
I can argue my side of the story,

33:46.324 --> 33:49.360
but in this case, I haven't got
a fucking leg to stand on.

33:49.427 --> 33:51.262
That's me, him and her done.

33:51.329 --> 33:56.467
He can pass us,
I won't speak to that kid again.

33:56.534 --> 33:59.537
I thought I was angry,
but now I found out about the kiss

33:59.604 --> 34:01.305
I don't wanna see Scott again.

34:01.372 --> 34:03.674
And Marnie's a bigger tramp
than I thought.

34:11.882 --> 34:14.318
It's gonna go off.

34:15.686 --> 34:18.022
(horn blares)

34:18.089 --> 34:20.525
Here they are. They're back.

34:20.591 --> 34:23.860
Oh, my God. I've just heard a beep,
Scott must be back.

34:23.928 --> 34:25.862
This is not gonna be pretty.

34:28.433 --> 34:31.569
I know as soon as Scott walks in,
shit is gonna hit the fan.

34:31.636 --> 34:34.338
Why can't I talk to her?
Talk to her then!

34:34.405 --> 34:37.909
That kid just needs to calm the fuck
down so he can actually listen.

34:37.975 --> 34:40.178
Ah, fuck off, man.

34:40.244 --> 34:45.382
Good job this table is between wor.
(sighs) Gonna fucking flip.

34:45.449 --> 34:47.918
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

34:49.954 --> 34:50.154
.

34:52.690 --> 34:52.889
.

35:00.598 --> 35:03.568
Here they are. They're back.
You have no idea.

35:03.634 --> 35:06.904
I've heard a beep.
Scott must be back.

35:06.971 --> 35:09.006
This is not gonna be pretty.

35:10.475 --> 35:12.109
Oh...

35:15.813 --> 35:17.148
Oi, oi.

35:19.150 --> 35:23.087
So I've walked in and everyone's
got faces like fucking demons.

35:23.154 --> 35:24.889
I'm guessing Aaron's back.

35:29.160 --> 35:32.163
There couldn't be a worse time
to be dressed like a twat.

35:32.230 --> 35:34.131
Scott has no clue what's coming.

35:34.198 --> 35:35.733
He's fucking raging.

35:35.800 --> 35:38.469
I need go upstairs
before I do something stupid.

35:38.536 --> 35:44.008
Oi, oi, snake. Fucking hell, that
hair's better than your normal hair.

35:44.075 --> 35:45.843
You fucking dickhead.

35:45.910 --> 35:49.380
I hope we don't lose wor rags.
I know he's gonna be annoyed at us,

35:49.447 --> 35:53.050
but I've got a perfectly good
explanation why I did what I did.

35:57.522 --> 36:01.025
Are you gonna stay up here or
are you gonna go and talk to him?

36:01.092 --> 36:03.461
I don't wanna speak to him
cos I'll lose it.

36:03.528 --> 36:07.598
I can't believe they've done this.
People in this house have no morals.

36:07.665 --> 36:10.935
What exactly does he know?
He knows you've necked on.

36:11.002 --> 36:13.371
He was annoyed before
he even found out that.

36:13.437 --> 36:16.440
I don't think, even if you say
you had your reasons,

36:16.507 --> 36:18.342
it's gonna make any difference.

36:18.409 --> 36:21.546
Turns out that Aaron's been
told about the kiss in the taxi,

36:21.612 --> 36:22.813
that's fucking mint.

36:22.880 --> 36:26.884
It's always gonna sound worse
coming from one of these twats.

36:32.523 --> 36:35.226
What's happening, Charls?
You all right?

36:35.293 --> 36:36.294
Yeah, how are you?

36:36.360 --> 36:39.664
Aaron's come downstairs and I know
as soon as Scott walks in

36:39.730 --> 36:41.132
shit is gonna hit the fan.

36:43.868 --> 36:46.437
(sighs) Fucking hell.

36:46.504 --> 36:52.510
I cannot put this off any longer.
This needs to be sorted now.

36:54.745 --> 36:57.882
Hi, you all right?
No, not really, like.

36:57.949 --> 37:00.885
I thought we were mates.
We are mates.

37:00.952 --> 37:04.255
Are we fuck. How are we mates?

37:04.322 --> 37:07.758
Do you think if you left the house
I would go straight to the girl

37:07.825 --> 37:09.493
and start necking on with her?

37:09.560 --> 37:12.163
Do you think I'd have you
go for us for no reason?

37:12.229 --> 37:15.466
You were saying you've got
unfinished business with her!

37:15.533 --> 37:18.002
I said, "Let's have a threesome,"
for a joke.

37:18.069 --> 37:20.404
And you ran straight to Marnie
and told her.

37:20.471 --> 37:23.007
Fucking hell,
will you just shut up and listen

37:23.074 --> 37:25.610
instead of booting off
like a five-year-old?

37:25.676 --> 37:27.645
What's the craic
necking on with her?

37:27.712 --> 37:30.548
That was cos of what you did to me.
Ah, fuck off, man.

37:30.615 --> 37:35.252
So I'm waiting for an apology,
but he's trying to justify it.

37:35.319 --> 37:37.455
Good job
this table's between wor.

37:37.521 --> 37:41.258
It's not the fucking first time.
You always go behind my back.

37:41.325 --> 37:44.295
Why can't I talk to her?
Well, talk to her then!

37:44.362 --> 37:47.565
Every time I go near her...
Because you neck on with her!

37:47.632 --> 37:49.367
Cos of what you did.
Fuck off.

37:49.433 --> 37:52.903
Things are getting so heated,
everyone's just watching them.

37:52.970 --> 37:56.507
No-one has a clue what to say,
especially me.

37:56.574 --> 38:00.244
We're in this house,
you and her don't speak to me again.

38:00.311 --> 38:03.447
You're a snake and she's a snake,
youse belong together.

38:03.514 --> 38:05.650
Get your unfinished business sorted.

38:05.716 --> 38:08.252
I don't wanna be
unfinished business sorted.

38:08.319 --> 38:11.122
You fucking did in the taxi!
Aye, because, mate...

38:11.188 --> 38:12.623
Why did you go for me then?

38:12.690 --> 38:16.427
Because I watched you say
you have unfinished business.

38:16.494 --> 38:20.197
Your mates?
Mates don't mug each other off.

38:20.264 --> 38:23.534
This is never gonna get resolved.
He needs to calm down

38:23.601 --> 38:25.970
so he can listen
to what I've got to say.

38:26.037 --> 38:30.708
I need to fucking leave here.
I'm gonna fucking flip.

38:30.775 --> 38:34.412
I dunno why the fuck Aaron even came
back if he's still got a rage on.

38:34.478 --> 38:37.515
How will we sort this out
if we can't have a conversation?

38:44.989 --> 38:48.359
Tonight'll be mint with these
two at each other's throats(!)

38:48.426 --> 38:50.628
We should probably just get ready.

38:57.635 --> 39:00.004
As if things aren't awkward enough,

39:00.071 --> 39:03.107
we have gotta share a room,
there's no escaping him.

39:12.049 --> 39:16.253
I don't how we'll make it
through the night.

39:16.320 --> 39:17.922
This is awkward as fuck.

39:17.988 --> 39:19.724
Everyone ready?

39:21.759 --> 39:25.529
Tonight Aaron's back, we're hitting
Tup Tup, it should be amazing.

39:25.596 --> 39:29.066
Wait, no, it shouldn't,
because no-one is fucking talking.

39:33.437 --> 39:36.340
We get to Tup Tup
and even though I'm still foaming,

39:36.407 --> 39:38.509
I'm gonna try and have a good night.

39:43.013 --> 39:45.216
Everyone's trying to have
a good night,

39:45.282 --> 39:48.919
but I feel like we're all just
waiting for Aaron to explode

39:48.986 --> 39:50.688
all over Scott's face.

40:01.766 --> 40:03.400
I feel bad for what I did

40:03.467 --> 40:07.004
and my friendship with Aaron
is worth more than a fucking neck on

40:07.071 --> 40:09.974
and I just wish he understood that,
the fucking dafty.

40:27.491 --> 40:30.127
I'm still so angry,
I can barely look at them

40:30.194 --> 40:33.597
and I know Gary's right,
I should just ignore them.

40:49.079 --> 40:51.448
The sooner this gets sorted
the better,

40:51.515 --> 40:54.785
so I'm gonna go and try
and sort this out now.

40:54.852 --> 40:57.054
Aaron, Aaron.

41:01.959 --> 41:04.762
I will speak to Scott
when I'm ready, not when he is.

41:04.829 --> 41:06.397
He doesn't dictate this.

41:08.833 --> 41:10.968
Could tonight be any more awkward?

41:11.035 --> 41:13.904
There's only one thing
I can think of to resolve this.

41:13.971 --> 41:16.173
Lots of fucking shots.

41:29.920 --> 41:33.057
Everyone in this house may be
able to forgive and forget,

41:33.123 --> 41:34.892
but there's no coming back.

41:38.229 --> 41:41.498
While the boys have been carrying on
like a bunch of fairies,

41:41.565 --> 41:46.270
me and the girls have been
getting absolutely mortal. Oops.

41:52.243 --> 41:54.378
The girls might be
having a good night,

41:54.445 --> 41:57.281
but there's no chance
Aaron's gonna forgive Scott.

41:57.348 --> 41:58.916
Time we got ourselves home.

42:00.284 --> 42:01.685
I feel fine here.

42:01.752 --> 42:05.456
And heel and toe.
You forgot to do heel and toe.

42:05.522 --> 42:10.227
I don't know what happened to
Charlotte tonight, she's a state.

42:22.640 --> 42:26.877
Everyone's smashed, eating anything
they can get their hands on,

42:26.944 --> 42:28.712
I'm absolutely buzzing.

42:32.716 --> 42:34.885
Charlotte is absolutely mortal,

42:34.952 --> 42:37.588
so I'm gonna be a gent
and put her to bed.

42:43.160 --> 42:46.363
I really, really wanna have
sex with Kyle, but I can't,

42:46.430 --> 42:49.767
so I'm just gonna have to get in bed
with my clothes on.

42:59.276 --> 43:03.614
I thought having them two in a club
would resolve things,

43:03.681 --> 43:05.849
but it didn't,
it just made things worse.

43:05.916 --> 43:09.586
Fucking little fucking plan
to try and get back at us worked,

43:09.653 --> 43:12.389
because in the long run
I know who's gonna suffer

43:12.456 --> 43:14.892
and it certainly isn't gonna be me.

43:14.959 --> 43:19.630
Even if Scott apologises I don't
know if I'll be able to believe him.

43:20.597 --> 43:22.866
I'm not sure whether
this is acceptable.

43:22.933 --> 43:26.770
I've tried so hard to get on

43:26.837 --> 43:28.739
Fuck, we are such shit friends.

43:28.806 --> 43:30.841
My God.

43:30.908 --> 43:33.410
Awkward.
Can someone open the door?!

43:33.477 --> 43:34.845
Oh, my God!

43:34.912 --> 43:38.115
Fucking hell, these farmers
are absolutely nuts.

43:39.516 --> 43:42.786
Why would you make us feel
so fucking stupid?

43:42.853 --> 43:46.023
She can't justify this behaviour,
I've done nothing wrong.

43:46.090 --> 43:47.725
I fucking hate you!

43:47.791 --> 43:49.226
Psycho Charlotte is back.

44:13.450 --> 44:13.650
