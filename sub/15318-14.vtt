[Kate pounding on door]
Come on, let's go!

00:08.026 --> 00:10.961
You're late for
the staff meeting!

00:12.975 --> 00:14.726
[Will gasps in shock]

00:14.728 --> 00:16.123
Son of a bitch!

00:18.056 --> 00:19.518
What's going on
in there?

00:19.520 --> 00:20.517
You okay?

00:20.519 --> 00:22.553
Yeah, yeah, I'm just...

00:22.555 --> 00:24.193
[Groans]

00:24.195 --> 00:26.596
Just overslept!

00:26.598 --> 00:28.368
Tell Magnus I'll be right there.

00:28.370 --> 00:30.376
Okay.

00:31.478 --> 00:34.578
[Breathing hard]

00:42.152 --> 00:43.188
[Magnus]: ...Several cases
of laminitis

00:43.190 --> 00:44.221
amongst the Borzels,

00:44.223 --> 00:45.556
caused by overfeeding.

00:45.558 --> 00:47.191
[Kate]: I can't help it.
They're cute!

00:47.193 --> 00:49.095
That may be the--
Will!

00:49.097 --> 00:50.529
Nice of you
to finally join us.

00:50.531 --> 00:51.796
[Will]:
Yeah, sorry,

00:51.798 --> 00:52.796
I, uh, slept
through my alarm.

00:52.798 --> 00:55.164
Dude, what's
with your face?

00:55.166 --> 00:57.167
What do you mean?

00:59.306 --> 01:01.640
Well, did you sleep on
a tennis racket or something?

01:01.642 --> 01:02.743
[Magnus]:
Wait, stop!

01:02.745 --> 01:03.710
Don't...

01:03.712 --> 01:05.846
Don't touch it.

01:05.848 --> 01:07.782
[Will]:
What is it?

01:07.784 --> 01:10.451
The placoid structure
is similar,

01:10.453 --> 01:13.586
but the enamel
is completely different.

01:13.588 --> 01:16.189
Henry, pass me a syringe.

01:16.191 --> 01:17.489
[Will]: Magnus,
can you just,

01:17.491 --> 01:18.558
please...

01:18.560 --> 01:20.293
I need to take some blood.

01:20.295 --> 01:21.460
That's all
very fine and good,

01:21.462 --> 01:23.162
but can you
fill me in here?

01:23.164 --> 01:24.430
I mean...

01:24.432 --> 01:26.498
You're acting like
I walked out of

01:26.500 --> 01:28.633
a Salvador Dali
painting or something.

01:28.635 --> 01:30.500
[He winces]

01:31.769 --> 01:33.736
You've got something
on your face.

01:33.738 --> 01:36.605
Now...

01:36.607 --> 01:39.175
It could be nothing,

01:39.177 --> 01:42.546
but I need to run some tests
to find out.

01:42.548 --> 01:46.384
Well, can I
at least see it?

01:46.386 --> 01:47.585
[Henry]: Doc?

01:47.587 --> 01:49.688

I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

02:29.048 --> 02:30.481
Now you tell me.

02:32.784 --> 02:34.484
Hey, uh, what about
your helmet?

02:34.486 --> 02:38.254
Turns out
you're not contagious.

02:38.256 --> 02:40.455
Well, isn't that
a slice of good news?

02:40.457 --> 02:41.823

that I seem to be

02:41.825 --> 02:44.158

some sort of lizard?

02:44.160 --> 02:47.562
The blood and DNA tests
came back inconclusive.

A search of your quarters
revealed nothing.

for the results

02:51.369 --> 02:53.636
of the full-body scans.

02:53.638 --> 02:58.440
So, in other words,
you have no idea.

02:58.442 --> 03:01.076
When did you first notice
the symptoms?

03:01.078 --> 03:02.411
I didn't.

03:02.413 --> 03:03.612
I first found out
about it

03:03.614 --> 03:05.448
when you guys so kindly
pointed it out to me

03:05.450 --> 03:06.715
this morning.

03:06.717 --> 03:07.716
Anything else
out of the ordinary?

03:07.718 --> 03:10.152
Any headaches,
any fatigue?

03:10.154 --> 03:12.455
Yeah, a bit of both,
I guess.

03:12.457 --> 03:14.057
I'm thinking, though, that
Tylenol and a power nap

03:14.059 --> 03:17.627
aren't gonna cut it
for this.

03:25.237 --> 03:27.437
Hm, right.

03:27.439 --> 03:29.639
The important thing,
not to panic.

03:29.641 --> 03:31.074
We'll know more

03:31.076 --> 03:33.243
when the results
of your scans come back.

03:33.245 --> 03:35.345
And what about
the meantime?

03:35.347 --> 03:39.249
Ah, in the meantime,

03:39.251 --> 03:40.517

03:40.519 --> 03:43.320

that you owe me.

let you out?

04:07.579 --> 04:08.878
Yeah.

04:08.880 --> 04:11.114
I think she, uh,
just put me up there

04:11.116 --> 04:14.150
to get caught up
on some work.

04:14.152 --> 04:15.485
Cool.

something?

Oh! Nah,
not at all.

talking about, uh...

04:45.182 --> 04:48.283

04:48.285 --> 04:50.184

04:50.186 --> 04:52.154
that you guys would
rather watch cricket

04:52.156 --> 04:53.621
than a Jays game,

04:53.623 --> 04:55.556
so what is going on?

04:55.558 --> 04:57.158
It's true.

about me, or what?

really tell it's there.

what it is yet?

a reliable indicator.

some progress.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.634
Ah.

06:13.636 --> 06:14.868
What are those?

06:14.870 --> 06:16.537

hybrid creature.

06:21.910 --> 06:22.876
Huh...

06:22.878 --> 06:24.812
Are they what's
causing this?

06:24.814 --> 06:26.514

altering your DNA

06:26.516 --> 06:28.782
one cell at a time.

06:30.718 --> 06:31.952
Into what?

I don't know.

06:33.889 --> 06:35.990
The resulting
chromosomal structure

06:35.992 --> 06:37.491
is still evolving,

06:37.493 --> 06:38.760
and so far it doesn't
match anything

06:38.762 --> 06:40.595
in the Sanctuary
database.

06:40.597 --> 06:41.496

06:41.498 --> 06:43.065

do I have?

06:44.635 --> 06:46.601
It's still early stages.

06:46.603 --> 06:48.903
I'm working on
an anti-viral flush

06:48.905 --> 06:50.471

kill the spores.

06:50.473 --> 06:51.739
After that,

06:51.741 --> 06:52.874

likely rid itself

Oh, my God.

08:32.741 --> 08:35.077
Interesting.

08:35.078 --> 08:36.513
I used
a different word

08:36.515 --> 08:37.681
while scraping
scrambled eggs

08:37.683 --> 08:38.881
off the floor,

08:38.884 --> 08:40.451
something with
four letters.

08:40.453 --> 08:41.751

I already apologized,

08:41.754 --> 08:43.520

how to knock.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.458
You need to not hang out
on the ceiling.

08:46.460 --> 08:48.494
[Will]: This is
going to help you

08:48.496 --> 08:49.995
find out what's
causing this, right?

08:49.997 --> 08:53.665
Actually, this rather
confuses the issue.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.100
I'd originally thought
these spores

08:55.102 --> 08:57.502
were from an offshoot
of the frilled coral rat,

08:57.504 --> 09:00.071
but their habitat
is entirely aquatic.

09:00.073 --> 09:01.473

09:01.475 --> 09:03.708
These are clearly meant
for climbing.

09:03.710 --> 09:07.045

the crap out of people.

09:07.047 --> 09:09.513

back to square one?

09:09.515 --> 09:10.915

I <i> was</i> working with.

09:16.155 --> 09:17.121
[Will]: Yeah,
that's kind of

09:17.123 --> 09:20.424
what square one
means.

09:21.626 --> 09:23.026

There we go. Right.

09:35.640 --> 09:37.040
I'm going back to my lab.

09:37.042 --> 09:38.575
Try to relax,

in your physiology.

your special ability.

a job?

10:23.089 --> 10:24.955
You're going to love it.
Come with me.

10:24.957 --> 10:26.123
Yeah, sure.

Baccarat crystal chandelier

10:33.833 --> 10:37.736
given to Magnus in 1938
by the Marquess of Linlithgow.

10:37.738 --> 10:39.838
Exhibit B...

10:39.840 --> 10:42.006
I think I see
where this is going.

10:42.008 --> 10:43.675
Magnus has been hassling me
for months

10:43.677 --> 10:44.977
to change the bulbs
in that chandelier,

10:44.979 --> 10:46.578
but I am telling you, dude,

10:46.580 --> 10:48.280
there is not a ladder
on the market

10:48.282 --> 10:50.182
that is tall enough
to get up there,

10:50.184 --> 10:54.553
and all the flying residents
wanted cash, so...

10:54.555 --> 10:56.655
I'm your lizard.

10:56.657 --> 10:58.057
Yes...

10:58.059 --> 10:59.625
You're a lifesaver.

11:01.862 --> 11:03.796
Check this out.

11:17.242 --> 11:18.609
Dude, this is amazing!

11:18.611 --> 11:19.877
You're like
Spider-Man,

11:19.879 --> 11:20.878
but without
the tights.

11:20.880 --> 11:21.912
Thankfully.

11:21.914 --> 11:24.314
This may come in handy.

11:24.316 --> 11:25.882
[Winces in pain]

11:27.885 --> 11:29.552
Ow...

11:29.554 --> 11:30.920
Hey, what's
wrong?

11:30.922 --> 11:33.991
I don't know, it's just
really bright or something.

11:33.993 --> 11:35.826
[Groans in pain]

11:36.928 --> 11:37.961
[Thud]

11:37.963 --> 11:39.697
Will!

11:39.699 --> 11:40.698
Will!

11:40.700 --> 11:42.700
Hey! You okay?

11:42.702 --> 11:43.935
Help!

11:43.937 --> 11:45.270
I need help here!

11:46.339 --> 11:47.773
[Light whines piercingly]

11:47.775 --> 11:49.608
[Will groans in pain]

11:49.610 --> 11:51.009
All right,
all right.

11:51.011 --> 11:53.912
Take it easy.

11:53.914 --> 11:56.948
[Will]: Yeah, so much for
the Spider-Man routine.

11:56.950 --> 11:58.650
Count yourself lucky.

11:58.652 --> 12:01.186
Your hardened bone structure
and the scaling on your body

12:01.188 --> 12:04.623
protected you from
a more serious injury.

12:04.625 --> 12:07.125
What were you doing
up there anyway?

12:07.127 --> 12:08.093
He was changing
a light bulb

12:08.095 --> 12:09.361
on that chandelier.

12:09.363 --> 12:11.863
It's on a winch!

12:11.865 --> 12:14.900
There's a control panel
under the staircase.

12:16.335 --> 12:20.305
Yeah, I probably
should have known that.

12:20.307 --> 12:23.041
[Will winces in pain]

12:23.043 --> 12:24.977
What the hell?

12:24.979 --> 12:28.880
You've developed
a sensitivity to UV rays.

12:28.882 --> 12:30.215
Yeah, you think?

12:30.217 --> 12:31.483
This is a good thing.

12:31.485 --> 12:33.719
Yeah, I know, Magnus,
it's another symptom.

12:33.721 --> 12:37.356
When are we going to
find out what it is?

12:37.358 --> 12:39.724
Actually, I have a theory.

12:39.726 --> 12:41.893
First, we need to
take precautions

12:41.895 --> 12:44.262
to protect you from
direct sunlight.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.764
[Staple gun clicks]

12:46.766 --> 12:48.399
[Will]: I really
appreciate this, guys.

12:48.401 --> 12:50.768
Aw, hey, man,
it's the least we can do.

12:50.770 --> 12:54.706
Yeah, sunshine's
overrated anyway.

12:54.708 --> 12:56.374
Ah, there.

12:56.376 --> 12:58.010
You're good from here
to your room,

12:58.012 --> 12:59.811
all the way
to your office,

12:59.813 --> 13:01.180
including the elevator.

13:01.182 --> 13:03.149
Just remember
to press "down".

13:03.151 --> 13:03.950
[Will]: Right...

13:03.952 --> 13:04.951
[Chuckling]

13:04.953 --> 13:06.386
There you are.

13:06.388 --> 13:08.354
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

13:08.356 --> 13:09.688
[Will]: All you had to do

13:09.690 --> 13:12.791
was follow the trail
of black fabric.

13:15.028 --> 13:17.829
[Nervously]
What is it?

13:17.831 --> 13:19.197
I finally figured out

13:19.199 --> 13:20.998
why the DNA of this creature
you're turning into

13:21.000 --> 13:23.768
isn't in any of
our databases.

13:23.770 --> 13:26.204
It's not from Earth.

13:26.206 --> 13:28.405
You mean, like-
like, aliens?

13:30.442 --> 13:32.877
Your experience with
the sunlight gave me the idea,

13:32.879 --> 13:35.346
so I scanned through the records
that Tesla was able to glean

13:35.348 --> 13:37.782
from the holographic map,

13:37.784 --> 13:40.918
and I found a perfect match.

13:42.487 --> 13:44.088
[Will]: Don't tell me.

13:44.090 --> 13:45.790
I'm afraid so.

13:45.792 --> 13:47.858
I appears that the creature
that infected you

13:47.860 --> 13:50.061
is from Hollow Earth.

13:52.822 --> 13:53.956
[Magnus]: I wanted
to show you this

13:53.958 --> 13:55.691
before I talked to Will.

13:55.693 --> 13:57.092
It's called a
Cillobar,

13:57.094 --> 13:59.796
a predatory
plant-animal hybrid.

13:59.798 --> 14:01.331
Boy, that is
one ugly weed.

14:01.333 --> 14:03.733
Comparatively rare,
even by underworld standards.

14:03.735 --> 14:05.201
It reproduces

14:05.203 --> 14:06.970
by infecting its victims
with its spores.

14:06.972 --> 14:09.005
You didn't run across
any Cillobar.

14:09.007 --> 14:10.040
We didn't have to.

14:10.042 --> 14:11.241
According to the data,

14:11.243 --> 14:13.010
the creature blooms
at the end of its life,

14:13.012 --> 14:15.412
spreading hundreds of spores
over a wide area.

14:15.414 --> 14:16.780
Now, most aren't viable,

14:16.782 --> 14:19.316
but the ones that are
can survive outside a host

14:19.318 --> 14:20.850
for up to six months.

14:20.852 --> 14:21.985
So Will just
picked one up

14:21.987 --> 14:23.853
along the trail
to the city?

14:23.855 --> 14:26.389
We must have crossed through
its habitat at some point,

14:26.391 --> 14:28.324
perhaps while we were
running through

14:28.326 --> 14:29.725
the Basilisk field.

14:29.727 --> 14:30.893
Okay, what about us?

14:30.895 --> 14:31.994
Your scans
came back clean.

14:31.996 --> 14:32.895
You?

14:32.897 --> 14:34.096
As did mine.

14:34.098 --> 14:35.231
Remind me never
to go camping

14:35.233 --> 14:36.299
in Hollow Earth.

14:36.301 --> 14:38.200
What can we do about it now?

14:38.202 --> 14:39.402
Well, unfortunately,

14:39.404 --> 14:40.936
there's very little
information in the file

14:40.938 --> 14:43.172
about how to treat
a suspected contamination,

14:43.174 --> 14:45.742
but now that we have an idea
where this is headed,

14:45.744 --> 14:46.809
we have options.

14:46.811 --> 14:48.410
Such as?

14:48.412 --> 14:50.212
Henry...

14:50.214 --> 14:51.813
I'd like you
to get in touch with Ranna.

14:51.815 --> 14:53.215
Okay--

14:53.217 --> 14:54.817
um, wait,

14:54.819 --> 14:56.285
as in Praxis,
Hollow Earth Ranna?

14:56.287 --> 14:58.321
She'll put us in touch
with my father.

14:58.323 --> 15:01.157
Now, if anyone can provide us
with information on a treatment,

15:01.159 --> 15:02.458
he can.

15:02.460 --> 15:04.027
Okay, but is this
a good idea?

15:04.029 --> 15:05.561
I mean, Ranna was pretty firm

15:05.563 --> 15:06.929
on the whole "don't call us,
we'll call you" dynamic.

15:06.931 --> 15:08.364
I don't care.

15:08.366 --> 15:10.766
She can yell at us all she wants
when we reach her.

15:10.768 --> 15:12.034
Quick sidebar.

15:12.036 --> 15:14.069
Um, how exactly
am I reaching her?

15:14.071 --> 15:15.404
You said you'd been
working on something

15:15.406 --> 15:16.338
since we got back.

15:16.340 --> 15:17.539
Well, yeah--

15:17.541 --> 15:18.974
Speed it up.

15:18.976 --> 15:20.509
Speed it... hmm.

15:24.915 --> 15:26.682
[Knock on door]

15:26.684 --> 15:28.184
[Door opens]

15:28.186 --> 15:30.252
You know, most people choose
to rest when they're sick.

15:30.254 --> 15:32.488
Yeah, not me.

15:32.490 --> 15:34.356
I, uh, just thought

15:34.358 --> 15:36.325
I'd catch up
on some filing here.

15:36.327 --> 15:38.326
And how's that
going for you?

15:38.328 --> 15:40.996
Not well.

15:40.998 --> 15:43.398
My eyes hurt,

15:43.400 --> 15:46.100
and, uh, there's
also this...

15:47.470 --> 15:49.871
Oh...

15:49.873 --> 15:51.372
When did that happen?

15:51.374 --> 15:53.808
A couple hours ago.

15:53.810 --> 15:56.510
What did Magnus
have to say about it?

15:56.512 --> 15:58.878
It doesn't matter.

15:58.880 --> 16:02.615
I'm still turning
into that thing, so...

16:04.985 --> 16:08.354
Did you want
something?

16:08.356 --> 16:10.389
No, it can wait.

16:10.391 --> 16:14.526
No, but really,
what is it?

16:17.997 --> 16:20.232
Um...

16:20.234 --> 16:22.568
Abby called.

16:22.570 --> 16:24.070
[He sighs]

16:24.072 --> 16:25.872
I told her
you weren't feeling well,

16:25.874 --> 16:27.574
but she...

16:27.576 --> 16:29.877
She asked to see you.

16:37.252 --> 16:40.020
Yeah, I don't know.

16:42.423 --> 16:44.290
Know what?
Don't worry about it.

16:44.292 --> 16:46.192
I'll take care of it.

16:47.261 --> 16:48.962
Thanks.

16:52.999 --> 16:54.400
[Will, voice rumbly]:
H...

16:54.402 --> 16:55.434
Hey.

16:55.436 --> 16:57.102
How's it going?

16:57.104 --> 16:59.271
Oh, yeah, good.

16:59.273 --> 17:02.341
You don't
have to lie, man.

17:02.343 --> 17:03.608
[Henry sighs heavily]

17:03.610 --> 17:06.144
Now I know how Marconi felt.

17:06.146 --> 17:08.311
Can't get
the signal there?

17:08.314 --> 17:09.980
Getting it there
is not an issue.

17:09.982 --> 17:13.450
Just have to create a modified
ultra-low-frequency wave,

17:13.452 --> 17:14.685
hijack a little time

17:14.686 --> 17:16.420
on the U.S. Navy's
Seafarer transmitter,

17:16.422 --> 17:17.487
and then boom.

17:17.489 --> 17:19.556
However...

17:19.558 --> 17:22.092
What's
the problem?

17:22.094 --> 17:24.428
The city's the problem.

17:24.430 --> 17:25.862
If you'll recall,

17:25.864 --> 17:28.165
it's surrounded by
massive lodestone deposits

17:28.166 --> 17:30.367
which effectively
make it impossible

17:30.369 --> 17:33.336
for an em transmission
to go in either direction,

17:33.338 --> 17:35.071
so in order to
punch through that,

17:35.073 --> 17:37.340
I have to find
a high frequency wave,

17:37.342 --> 17:41.077
somewhere in the region
of 150 to 200 exahertz.

17:41.079 --> 17:44.113
So, low to get there,
high to get in.

17:44.115 --> 17:46.315
Yup. Oh, man.

17:46.317 --> 17:48.384
Forehead, meet brick wall.

17:48.386 --> 17:50.019
Henry!

17:50.021 --> 17:51.120
Yeah?

17:51.122 --> 17:52.555
I need you
to gear up the van.

17:52.557 --> 17:55.392
We've just had a report
of a Terrakopolus on the loose

17:55.394 --> 17:56.460
in Trench Park.

17:56.462 --> 17:57.461
Okay, I'm on it.

17:57.463 --> 17:58.729
Listen, dude,

17:58.731 --> 18:00.597
I'm going to jump back on this
when we're done, okay?

18:00.599 --> 18:03.033
It's gonna take some time
for the data to compile anyway,

18:03.035 --> 18:06.236
so, uh, just hang in there.

18:08.974 --> 18:11.608
Yeah, I know,
I can't go.

18:11.610 --> 18:12.676
Don't worry
about it.

18:12.678 --> 18:16.347
I'll, uh, hold down
the fort here.

18:16.349 --> 18:18.449
Thanks, Will.

18:23.321 --> 18:25.956
[Knock on door]

18:25.958 --> 18:27.390
Come in.

18:27.392 --> 18:28.558
[Door opens]

18:31.529 --> 18:33.330
Hey...

18:33.332 --> 18:36.066
It's not easy, huh?

18:36.068 --> 18:39.003
Being left out of the action.

18:39.005 --> 18:42.039
No, it sure does suck.

18:42.041 --> 18:43.540
Come on.

18:43.542 --> 18:45.743
Come on, I want to
show you something.

18:52.385 --> 18:55.119
[Unlocks padlock]

18:55.121 --> 18:57.155
[Door creaks slowly]

19:01.027 --> 19:02.527
After you.

19:04.530 --> 19:07.465
[Will gasps in amazement]

19:07.467 --> 19:09.701
Wow.

19:09.703 --> 19:11.336
What is this place?

19:11.338 --> 19:12.437
What is all this stuff?

19:12.439 --> 19:14.072
Whiskey.

19:15.141 --> 19:17.008
Found the remnants
of an old still

19:17.010 --> 19:19.778
about 40 years ago.

19:19.780 --> 19:22.180
Been refining it
ever since.

19:32.160 --> 19:34.061
[Grunts encouragingly]

19:35.330 --> 19:36.764
[All laughing]
So Magnus comes in

19:36.766 --> 19:38.666
and shuts the window,

19:38.668 --> 19:40.300
and he's stuck
out there naked

19:40.302 --> 19:41.835
for two hours!

19:41.837 --> 19:43.804
[All laughing]

19:43.806 --> 19:48.342
I had to climb up
and knock on his window.

19:48.344 --> 19:52.045
[Laughing]

19:52.047 --> 19:54.615
[Will]: What were you
thinking?

19:54.617 --> 19:58.620
I've never been so happy
to have fur.

19:58.622 --> 20:01.256
[Laughs]

20:02.592 --> 20:04.159
What about you?

20:04.161 --> 20:06.061
[2nd face rants incoherently]:
Sons of bitches, you...

20:06.063 --> 20:08.129
Oh, I think
he's had enough.

20:08.131 --> 20:09.664
[Will chuckles warmly]

20:09.666 --> 20:11.266
[Will]: You guys really know
how to kick it back here.

20:11.268 --> 20:12.834
I tell you, this is...

20:12.836 --> 20:14.136
this is great.

20:14.138 --> 20:17.172
Oh, this is just
one of the many ways

20:17.174 --> 20:19.641
we spend our time.

20:19.643 --> 20:20.842
Speaking of which,

20:20.844 --> 20:22.778
they'll probably
be back soon.

20:24.314 --> 20:25.614
Right.

20:25.616 --> 20:28.283
Wait for it.

20:28.285 --> 20:29.684
[Will]: Wait for what?

20:29.686 --> 20:31.520
The song and dance.

20:31.522 --> 20:33.188
Yeah.

20:33.190 --> 20:36.091
Song and dance?

20:36.093 --> 20:37.726
[Clears throat]

20:37.728 --> 20:39.661
Every time you guys
come back from an op,

20:39.663 --> 20:41.830
all you can do
is talk about it.

20:41.832 --> 20:44.299
What?

20:44.301 --> 20:45.133
No...

20:45.135 --> 20:45.967
Yes!

20:45.969 --> 20:47.169
Yes.

20:47.171 --> 20:49.437
It's not really
that bad, is it?

20:49.439 --> 20:50.639
You go on and on

20:50.641 --> 20:53.508
about how spectacular
the latest takedown was.

20:53.510 --> 20:55.510
In minute detail.

20:55.512 --> 20:57.179
...So we chase it
down an alley, right,

20:57.181 --> 20:58.380
we got this thing
cornered, okay--

20:58.382 --> 20:59.715
and it starts
to freak out

20:59.717 --> 21:00.616
because it's got
nowhere else to go, right?

21:00.618 --> 21:01.884
And then all of a sudden--

21:01.886 --> 21:03.285
it splits into two!

21:03.287 --> 21:04.687
Right there in front of us.

21:04.689 --> 21:06.222
[Kate]: I was going
to tell them that!

21:06.224 --> 21:07.123
[Henry]: Yeah, but you can
tell them the other thing.

21:07.125 --> 21:08.625
[Kate]: Okay, so
all of a sudden,

21:08.627 --> 21:09.726
we're fighting this thing
on two ends, right,

21:09.728 --> 21:10.894
because there's me
on one side,

21:10.896 --> 21:12.329
there's Hank
on the other side--

21:12.331 --> 21:14.197
Yeah, and it's ugly,
I mean, it's so...

21:16.801 --> 21:19.603
[♪]

21:23.575 --> 21:25.309
Hey.

21:25.311 --> 21:26.777
Oh! God...

21:26.779 --> 21:30.513
I'm never gonna
get used to that.

21:30.515 --> 21:32.482
Hank said you didn't
eat dinner.

21:32.484 --> 21:33.416
[Will]: Yeah.

21:33.418 --> 21:36.320
Wasn't hungry.

21:36.322 --> 21:38.289
Still,
you should eat.

21:38.291 --> 21:40.592
Okay, mom.

21:40.594 --> 21:42.828
I'm just sayin'.

21:48.669 --> 21:52.672
What's wrong,
you're not hungry?

21:52.674 --> 21:55.341
[Will grumbles]

21:55.343 --> 21:58.578
[Will's voice is low and raspy]
Yeah, just...

21:58.580 --> 22:01.481
My hands.

22:03.417 --> 22:05.919
I can't control my grip.

22:10.357 --> 22:13.959
Okay, um...

22:13.961 --> 22:15.929
Here.

22:15.931 --> 22:16.996
[Will grumbles]

22:16.998 --> 22:18.498
No, no, no, no.

22:18.500 --> 22:19.633
No, relax.

22:19.635 --> 22:22.369
Just... just eat.

22:24.506 --> 22:26.908
Just eat.

22:26.910 --> 22:29.577
Don't make me make
the choo-choo sound.

22:35.886 --> 22:37.953
[Will]: Thank you.

22:37.955 --> 22:39.722
Okay, I came up
with an algorithm

22:39.724 --> 22:41.357
to modulate the transmission

22:41.359 --> 22:44.627
between the upper and lower ends
of the em spectrum.

22:44.629 --> 22:47.963
The tricky part was encoding
a binary message

22:47.965 --> 22:49.231
that could just--

22:49.233 --> 22:50.766
Okay, all right, yeah.

22:50.768 --> 22:52.301
What do we do?

22:52.303 --> 22:54.269
You just type
your message into here.

22:54.271 --> 22:56.238
Um, I've taken the liberty
of composing one already,

22:56.240 --> 22:57.272
if that's okay?

22:57.274 --> 22:58.574
Yeah, good.

22:58.576 --> 23:01.410
Okay, so, uh,
well, we just hit "send."

23:01.412 --> 23:04.579
[Device thrumming]

23:07.016 --> 23:08.517
And now...

23:08.519 --> 23:09.785
And now we wait.

23:09.787 --> 23:11.019
Once they get
the message,

23:11.021 --> 23:12.054
they're going to
have to decode it,

23:12.056 --> 23:13.656
get it into Ranna's hands,

23:13.658 --> 23:15.691
then find a way
to transmit it back,

23:15.693 --> 23:17.026
providing they get
our message at all,

23:17.028 --> 23:19.262
or choose to reply.

23:19.264 --> 23:20.963
Well, I don't think Ranna
would ignore

23:20.965 --> 23:22.465
a direct request like this.

23:22.467 --> 23:23.799
Well, either way,

23:23.801 --> 23:24.700
it's going to take
a little bit of time.

23:24.702 --> 23:27.436
All right.

23:27.438 --> 23:29.505

23:29.507 --> 23:30.973

of chemotherapy, radiation,

24:44.383 --> 24:46.950
angiogenesis inhibitors,
and ultrasound,

24:46.952 --> 24:48.051
and nothing...

bit of difference!

to keep trying.

How about the latest
round of tests?

24:58.897 --> 25:00.263

25:00.265 --> 25:01.364

a minor reduction

25:01.366 --> 25:03.232

of the affected cells.

25:03.234 --> 25:04.900

25:04.902 --> 25:06.969
It's hardly enough
to slow down the disease,

25:06.971 --> 25:08.104
let alone stop it,

25:08.106 --> 25:10.106
not to mention
reversing its effects.

did show some promise

set of tests that I did.

Leave me alone.

33:17.732 --> 33:19.098
Stop putting on a show.

33:19.100 --> 33:21.034
How dare--

33:22.837 --> 33:24.003
what did you just say?

33:24.005 --> 33:26.973
We are all of us in pain.

33:26.975 --> 33:28.174
No, no, no.

33:28.176 --> 33:31.211
You just said,
"stop putting on a show."

33:31.213 --> 33:32.678
Yes.

33:33.881 --> 33:35.815
Of course.

33:35.817 --> 33:37.617
Of course she would do
something like that.

33:37.619 --> 33:38.618
Come on.

33:40.087 --> 33:41.888
Henry!

33:41.890 --> 33:43.823
Can you pull up
that message that Ranna sent?

33:43.825 --> 33:44.958
Okay.

33:47.762 --> 33:48.729
Uh...

33:52.600 --> 33:53.801
Is that the whole thing?

33:53.803 --> 33:55.102
Yeah. Why?

33:55.104 --> 33:57.071
There's an underscore here

33:57.073 --> 33:58.038
at the end of
the first sentence.

33:58.040 --> 33:58.873
Why would she do that?

33:58.875 --> 33:59.907
I don't know.

33:59.909 --> 34:01.375
Maybe she's a bad typist.

34:01.377 --> 34:02.776
She typed it in cuneiform.

34:02.778 --> 34:05.278
Clearly this was intentional.

34:05.280 --> 34:06.813
I think she's trying
to tell us something.

34:06.815 --> 34:09.382
"Forbidden
communication under.

34:09.385 --> 34:11.217
You don't think...

34:11.219 --> 34:13.152
Wasn't there
some interference

34:13.155 --> 34:14.755
when the message
came through?

34:14.757 --> 34:17.091
Yeah, but I screened it
for binary data.

34:17.092 --> 34:18.759
We got everything
she wrote.

34:18.761 --> 34:20.761
What if the interference
<i>is</i> the message?

34:20.763 --> 34:22.262
Like a sound file?

34:22.264 --> 34:23.630
I don't know.

34:23.632 --> 34:24.697
Anything she sent
would have been scanned

34:24.699 --> 34:26.967
by their outgoing data filters.

34:26.969 --> 34:28.034
I think the Senate
would have caught that.

34:28.036 --> 34:29.704
Play it for me.

34:29.706 --> 34:30.905
It's just gonna
sound like static, so...

34:32.107 --> 34:33.808
[Static crackles]

34:34.810 --> 34:36.643
Slow it down.

34:37.846 --> 34:42.382
[Crackling regularly,
in bursts and drones]

34:45.154 --> 34:48.688
Morse code.

34:48.690 --> 34:50.091
You've got
to be kidding me.

34:50.092 --> 34:51.324
Ranna would have known
that the data filters

34:51.327 --> 34:52.659
wouldn't be looking
for something

34:52.661 --> 34:53.962
so primitive.

34:53.964 --> 34:54.896
Henry--

34:54.898 --> 34:55.797
I'm on it.

34:55.799 --> 34:56.697
Yup.

34:59.935 --> 35:01.902
"Gooban?"

35:01.904 --> 35:03.003
That's what it said.

35:03.005 --> 35:03.838
Are you sure?

35:03.840 --> 35:04.738
Yeah,
I checked it twice.

35:05.807 --> 35:06.874
[Typing rapidly]

35:07.976 --> 35:09.210
I don't believe it,
it's in here.

35:09.212 --> 35:11.312
This is the data
Tesla collected

35:11.314 --> 35:12.814
from the
holographic map.

35:12.816 --> 35:14.216
What does it mean?

35:14.218 --> 35:16.886
Well, apparently he was
a botanist of some note

35:16.888 --> 35:18.688
over 600 years ago.

35:18.690 --> 35:21.658
He resurrected
an extinct species of mushroom

35:21.660 --> 35:22.926
that now bears
his name.

35:22.928 --> 35:24.061
Gooban.

35:24.063 --> 35:25.729
What does this
have to do with Will?

35:27.165 --> 35:29.333
Oh, my God.

35:29.335 --> 35:30.967
It might actually work,
I-if we hurry.

35:30.969 --> 35:32.769
Find Kate
and get Will.

35:32.771 --> 35:34.070
Sedate him and
bring him to my lab.

35:34.072 --> 35:36.106
You're with me.

35:37.942 --> 35:39.742
[Snarling softly]

35:47.016 --> 35:48.850
What can I do?

35:48.852 --> 35:51.420
I need an untainted
sample of Will's DNA.

35:51.422 --> 35:52.988
Dr. Gooban's technique

35:52.990 --> 35:54.857
was to use the spores
of a living species

35:54.859 --> 35:57.260
to stimulate cell growth
in an extinct one.

35:57.262 --> 35:58.895
You think we can do
the same thing?

35:58.897 --> 36:00.430
The Cillobar spores

36:00.432 --> 36:01.899
are essentially
a delivery mechanism

36:01.901 --> 36:03.267
for the creature's DNA.

36:03.269 --> 36:04.535
Once introduced,

36:04.537 --> 36:06.270
they initiate a rapid
reproductive cycle

36:06.272 --> 36:07.905
which is impossible to control,

36:07.907 --> 36:09.774
but...

36:09.776 --> 36:13.177
If I can inject Will's DNA
into the spores--

36:13.179 --> 36:14.879
we may be able to use them
to reverse the process.

36:14.881 --> 36:17.982
It's a long shot,
I grant you,

36:17.984 --> 36:19.484
and even then,

36:19.486 --> 36:22.253
we still don't know if any
of Will's original chromosomes

36:22.255 --> 36:24.155
exist in the creature.

36:24.157 --> 36:28.292
All I need is one cell.

36:28.294 --> 36:31.829
Hey, buddy,
it's time to wake up.

36:31.831 --> 36:32.896
[Beeping door code]

36:37.235 --> 36:38.769
Hank...

36:38.771 --> 36:40.070
What the...

36:43.175 --> 36:45.242
[Beeping door code]

36:45.244 --> 36:48.412
[Door cranks open]

36:50.049 --> 36:51.916
Oh, man, how the hell
did he get through that?

36:52.951 --> 36:54.118
Hank?

36:58.190 --> 36:59.123
[Stunner blasts]

36:59.125 --> 37:00.492
Aw, crap.

37:00.494 --> 37:02.393
It's working.

37:02.395 --> 37:04.296
The cells are starting
to revert back

37:04.298 --> 37:05.464
to their original state.

37:06.800 --> 37:08.467
Where the hell
are Henry and Kate?

37:08.469 --> 37:09.502
[Alarm klaxons wail]

37:09.504 --> 37:11.103
Perimeter sensors!

37:11.105 --> 37:12.371
[Barking anxiously]

37:15.142 --> 37:16.242
What happened?

37:16.244 --> 37:18.511
Sorry, he caught us
by surprise.

37:18.513 --> 37:20.180
Up you get.

37:21.282 --> 37:22.282
Where is he now?

37:22.284 --> 37:25.119
Gone.

37:27.041 --> 37:28.106
[Distant sirens wail]

37:33.005 --> 37:34.306
All right,
so as you can see,

37:34.308 --> 37:35.774
we have our two
sightings here.

37:35.776 --> 37:36.774
Support teams
are in position,

37:36.776 --> 37:37.875
10-block radius.

37:37.877 --> 37:39.010
Good.

37:39.012 --> 37:40.711
We have a chance of
containing him at least.

37:40.713 --> 37:42.179
What about
the treatment?

37:42.181 --> 37:43.447
Four doses each,

37:43.449 --> 37:46.316
mixed with
a powerful sedative.

37:47.885 --> 37:49.486
[Kate]: How sure are
you about this stuff?

37:49.488 --> 37:53.789
Well, we've never
tested it, so...

37:53.791 --> 37:54.757
You all have to
be prepared

37:54.759 --> 37:55.991
if it doesn't work.

37:55.993 --> 37:57.259
What do you mean?

37:57.261 --> 38:00.061
She means we may need
to use lethal force.

38:01.197 --> 38:02.197
What?

38:02.199 --> 38:03.165
We can't risk

38:03.167 --> 38:04.533
further contamination.

38:04.535 --> 38:06.936
We've no idea of the life cycle
of this creature.

38:06.938 --> 38:08.238
If it reaches
maturity,

38:08.240 --> 38:10.440
it could release its
spores at any time.

38:10.442 --> 38:11.909
All of us
need to be willing

38:11.911 --> 38:13.377
to do whatever's
necessary.

38:13.379 --> 38:15.179
If not,

38:15.181 --> 38:16.413
you can recuse
yourself now,

38:16.415 --> 38:19.183
no questions asked.

38:19.185 --> 38:21.285
We're good.

38:22.787 --> 38:24.020
Henry?

38:25.056 --> 38:26.756
Yeah.

38:31.396 --> 38:33.063
[Tires screech]

38:36.367 --> 38:38.802
Spread out and stay
in radio contact.

gone far.

We have to get him back
to the Sanctuary right away.

[Monitors beeping steadily]

40:59.915 --> 41:01.114

41:09.959 --> 41:11.892
It's only been a few days.

41:11.894 --> 41:15.196
It'll take a while before
your recovery is complete.

41:15.198 --> 41:16.731
On the positive side,

this will do wonders for
your Bruce Willis impression.

[Will chuckles ruefully]
Jokes...

41:22.305 --> 41:24.672
That's a good sign.

41:29.577 --> 41:31.511

quite a scare.

slip away from me...

I don't ever want that
to happen again.

42:23.632 --> 42:27.034
It won't, I promise you.

42:31.106 --> 42:34.042
Except...

42:34.044 --> 42:35.577
You know that whole
climbing the wall thing?

42:35.579 --> 42:37.413
That was really cool.

You think maybe
we could--

No.

Really?
