00:40.700 --> 00:44.820
Plants cover much of the
land surface of our planet.

00:44.820 --> 00:49.220
But there is another
extraordinary green world

00:49.220 --> 00:51.020
that is often hidden from us.

01:04.740 --> 01:08.300
It's one where plants
have overcome huge challenges

01:08.300 --> 01:09.900
in order to survive.

01:18.300 --> 01:21.580
The world of fresh water.

01:35.220 --> 01:41.100
At first sight, a lake like this
would seem to have everything

01:41.100 --> 01:44.340
that life needs in order to thrive.

01:44.340 --> 01:47.700
Clear, oxygen-rich water,

01:47.700 --> 01:50.980
plenty of dissolved nutrients
and minerals

01:50.980 --> 01:53.620
and lots of sunlight.

01:53.620 --> 01:58.180
But, in fact, life in fresh water

01:58.180 --> 02:00.820
presents plants with huge problems.

02:04.060 --> 02:09.740
To succeed, plants have had to
abandon many of the adaptations

02:09.740 --> 02:12.740
that served them so well on land

02:12.740 --> 02:16.740
and evolve something
quite new and, doing that,

02:16.740 --> 02:21.820
they have created some of the most
beautiful and bizarre

02:21.820 --> 02:24.500
and important habitats on Earth.

02:30.180 --> 02:33.860
There are few places where
it's more difficult to make

02:33.860 --> 02:37.620
a permanent home than a freshwater
torrent like this one.

02:57.820 --> 03:03.260
Violent currents
drip across the riverbed,

03:03.260 --> 03:04.580
scouring it clean...

03:09.620 --> 03:14.100
..whipping land plants
from their margins

03:14.100 --> 03:15.380
and drowning them.

03:19.260 --> 03:23.220
How could any plant survive
in a place like this?

03:35.340 --> 03:38.860
Yet, even here, some do manage to,

03:38.860 --> 03:41.620
quite literally, hold on.

03:46.140 --> 03:50.580
They can grasp the bare rock
with remarkable strength.

03:56.740 --> 03:59.220
This ability allows plants to thrive

03:59.220 --> 04:02.140
in these otherwise
hostile environments.

04:07.620 --> 04:11.980
This is the Cano Cristales
river in Colombia.

04:27.700 --> 04:30.780
These plants are red Macarenia,

04:30.780 --> 04:35.060
sometimes called the
Orchid of the Falls.

04:44.460 --> 04:47.900
They cling to the riverbed,
not with their roots,

04:47.900 --> 04:52.380
but with their stems, glued
to the rock surface by one

04:52.380 --> 04:54.580
of the most powerful
adhesives in nature.

05:02.500 --> 05:04.660
The rock itself will break

05:04.660 --> 05:06.620
before these anchors
lose their grip.

05:17.580 --> 05:22.060
These feathery filaments
are their modified leaves,

05:22.060 --> 05:24.940
and they do what roots normally do -

05:24.940 --> 05:27.860
gather the minerals and
nutrients they need

05:27.860 --> 05:29.500
that are dissolved in the water.

05:35.620 --> 05:39.700
With such spectacular colours,
it's hardly surprising

05:39.700 --> 05:43.340
that the Cano Cristales
is sometimes called

05:43.340 --> 05:46.580
the most beautiful river on Earth.

05:52.340 --> 05:56.380
But being rooted to the spot
is not always the best strategy

05:56.380 --> 05:58.380
for living in a water world.

06:01.620 --> 06:04.940
This is a water lettuce,

06:04.940 --> 06:08.020
and it has some
remarkable adaptations.

06:09.740 --> 06:13.260
Its roots hang free,

06:13.260 --> 06:16.340
so it's not anchored to the ground,

06:16.340 --> 06:19.780
and its leaves are thick and spongy

06:19.780 --> 06:22.420
and covered in fine hairs.

06:22.420 --> 06:25.660
So the plant itself
is more or less unsinkable.

06:34.260 --> 06:38.340
This combination of characteristics
enable the water lettuce

06:38.340 --> 06:42.660
to do something that almost
no land plant can do.

06:42.660 --> 06:44.140
It can travel.

06:47.980 --> 06:52.100
It is an ability that
becomes invaluable when,

06:52.100 --> 06:56.180
during the wet season, flooded
rivers become great highways,

06:56.180 --> 06:59.060
as they do here in South America.

07:04.420 --> 07:08.500
This is the largest inland
water world on Earth.

07:08.500 --> 07:09.980
The Pantanal.

07:11.380 --> 07:15.700
For a few months every year,
it provides water plants

07:15.700 --> 07:18.380
with ideal conditions,

07:18.380 --> 07:23.180
but, all too soon,
it becomes a battleground.

07:31.940 --> 07:35.780
Plants are racing to claim
their space on the surface.

07:37.740 --> 07:42.180
The water lettuce rapidly expands
its network of hanging roots

07:42.180 --> 07:44.700
so that it starts
absorbing nutrients

07:44.700 --> 07:47.180
before other competitors arrive.

08:04.220 --> 08:06.700
Water hyacinth appears.

08:09.780 --> 08:14.540
Its leaves are carried
on stalks filled with air

08:14.540 --> 08:17.580
that also make it
virtually unsinkable.

08:22.820 --> 08:25.580
The race for space intensifies.

08:28.260 --> 08:32.060
A new competitor arrives, Ludwigia.

08:32.060 --> 08:35.780
It spreads by developing
a chain of tiny rafts.

08:37.660 --> 08:40.860
And jostles for space with
the densely packed leaves

08:40.860 --> 08:42.660
of mosaic plants.

08:49.740 --> 08:53.820
All are racing to claim
as much sunlight as possible.

09:04.060 --> 09:07.660
They flower quickly before
the floodwaters recede.

09:19.380 --> 09:22.900
And these surface dwellers
also have competitors.

09:25.500 --> 09:28.660
Including one that has been
waiting in the depths

09:28.660 --> 09:29.980
and is now stirring.

09:41.540 --> 09:43.580
It's a monster.

10:11.620 --> 10:13.540
It's well armed.

10:28.860 --> 10:33.460
It clears space for itself

10:33.460 --> 10:35.260
by wielding one of its buds.

10:37.140 --> 10:38.620
Like a club.

10:44.660 --> 10:48.380
And now it dominates the surface.

11:07.580 --> 11:11.300
This is a leaf of the
giant water lily.

11:32.300 --> 11:36.220
It expands by over
20 centimetres a day

11:36.220 --> 11:37.940
and eventually measures

11:37.940 --> 11:39.620
more than two metres across.

11:44.860 --> 11:50.140
Its immense leaves are supported
by a network of air-filled struts

11:50.140 --> 11:53.620
and protected by spines
two centimetres long.

11:58.460 --> 12:02.660
The leaves float high in the water
and their surfaces are dotted

12:02.660 --> 12:07.460
with tiny holes, drains, that
help them ensure that rainwater

12:07.460 --> 12:09.900
doesn't accumulate and sink them.

12:24.020 --> 12:28.740
Nutrients from the fertile mud
below are carried up by tubes

12:28.740 --> 12:32.500
in its stem to fuel
the leaf's expansion.

12:40.380 --> 12:43.860
Over the next few months,
the lily will produce

12:43.860 --> 12:46.980
some 40 or so of these
gigantic leaves.

12:56.900 --> 13:01.980
And as each one reaches the surface
and expands, more and more light

13:01.980 --> 13:05.780
is taken from those plants
that are trying to grow beneath.

13:18.700 --> 13:21.540
Competitors are pushed aside.

13:45.180 --> 13:48.020
Some are crushed,

13:48.020 --> 13:49.580
or skewered.

14:26.980 --> 14:31.060
Eventually, its immense
leaves press their margins

14:31.060 --> 14:33.220
against one another,

14:33.220 --> 14:37.020
totally cutting off the light
from the plants beneath them.

14:40.140 --> 14:43.140
The battle is over.

14:43.140 --> 14:45.620
And victory is total.

15:05.020 --> 15:08.860
The frozen water world of
Lake Akan in northern Japan.

15:13.300 --> 15:17.460
Home to one of the strangest
and most primitive of plants.

15:20.820 --> 15:26.620
It's an alga, like those that appear
so mysteriously in our ponds.

15:30.260 --> 15:33.540
But this one is truly extraordinary.

15:39.780 --> 15:44.540
Each spring, the melting ice
releases soft, velvety balls

15:44.540 --> 15:49.540
of interwoven threads
called Marimos.

15:53.220 --> 15:55.220
This one is small.

15:55.220 --> 15:56.980
No bigger than a walnut.

15:58.620 --> 16:00.940
But there are lots of them here.

16:06.780 --> 16:11.060
They attract the attention
of visiting whooper swans.

16:39.460 --> 16:44.460
But there is one way for the
Marimo to escape from the danger,

16:44.460 --> 16:46.620
and it depends on a change
in the weather.

16:51.460 --> 16:56.420
Fortunately, in the spring,
winds sweep across the lake...

16:58.420 --> 17:03.860
..creating currents that carry some
of the Marimos beyond the reach

17:03.860 --> 17:05.580
of hungry swans.

17:08.940 --> 17:11.780
It's the start
of a remarkable journey.

17:29.260 --> 17:33.140
They are gently carried back
and forth by the currents

17:33.140 --> 17:37.540
so that the Marimos become
more and more spherical.

17:43.900 --> 17:47.580
And, slowly, they travel
into deeper water.

18:00.340 --> 18:04.820
Here, there are great numbers
of them, certainly many millions.

18:06.500 --> 18:09.620
Some are the size of basketballs.

18:16.020 --> 18:18.180
They're safe from swans,

18:18.180 --> 18:20.540
and the water is still
shallow enough

18:20.540 --> 18:23.180
for some sunlight to reach them.

18:23.180 --> 18:25.140
It seems a perfect home.

18:26.620 --> 18:29.460
And so it is...

18:29.460 --> 18:30.500
..almost.

18:32.740 --> 18:37.660
The snag is that these waters
also carry a fine sediment

18:37.660 --> 18:40.540
that can clog the Marimo's surface,

18:40.540 --> 18:42.860
cutting off the all-important light.

18:46.380 --> 18:49.740
But the Marimos are not
entirely immobile.

18:59.180 --> 19:00.660
They dance.

19:09.620 --> 19:13.820
The winds blowing over the
lake's surface create currents

19:13.820 --> 19:18.420
beneath that are sufficiently
strong to move the Marimos.

19:26.020 --> 19:28.540
They rub against each other.

19:28.540 --> 19:31.980
And in just a couple of hours
of gentle movement,

19:31.980 --> 19:34.220
they're all clean once more.

19:40.700 --> 19:44.300
As they spin, every part
of their surface

19:44.300 --> 19:47.020
gets enough time in the sunlight
to keep growing.

20:05.740 --> 20:08.500
This is the heart of the Amazon.

20:26.020 --> 20:29.780
There are water worlds here that
are so remote that, even today,

20:29.780 --> 20:31.900
few people have ever seen them.

20:35.020 --> 20:39.540
This barely explored tributary
is the Rio Claro.

20:41.100 --> 20:44.620
And here, when conditions
are just right, it's possible

20:44.620 --> 20:47.740
to witness a rare
and remarkable spectacle.

20:58.620 --> 21:03.900
The river is so crystal clear
that its bed is bathed in sunlight.

21:10.500 --> 21:15.500
A magical landscape of miniature
mountains and valleys.

21:29.780 --> 21:34.580
It's carpeted by pipewort, fanwort

21:34.580 --> 21:36.820
and star grasses.

21:46.940 --> 21:49.740
As the sun climbs in the sky...

21:51.780 --> 21:56.300
..bubbles of gas appear.

21:56.300 --> 21:58.940
Evidence of photosynthesis.

22:10.260 --> 22:12.660
Deep inside the plant cells,

22:12.660 --> 22:15.260
tiny structures called chloroplasts

22:15.260 --> 22:17.300
move towards the light.

22:21.260 --> 22:24.940
They absorb carbon dioxide
and use the sun's power

22:24.940 --> 22:29.540
to synthesise the sugars
that the plant needs to grow.

22:33.940 --> 22:37.540
And as a by-product,
they release oxygen.

22:40.420 --> 22:44.940
The gas that we and all
other animals must have

22:44.940 --> 22:47.140
in order to breathe.

23:08.660 --> 23:13.620
Now, in late afternoon, bubbles
of oxygen make the river water

23:13.620 --> 23:15.740
fizz like champagne.

24:04.180 --> 24:07.700
The plants can become
so buoyant with gas

24:07.700 --> 24:11.140
that they rise to the surface,

24:11.140 --> 24:13.140
even carrying the bedrock with them.

24:24.380 --> 24:27.060
Only in this remote water world

24:27.060 --> 24:30.540
can this spectacular
natural wonder be seen.

24:40.100 --> 24:42.140
Eastern Venezuela.

24:45.460 --> 24:49.700
Here, rectangular table mountains
known as tepuis

24:49.700 --> 24:52.140
stand above the tropical forest.

24:57.060 --> 25:00.740
There are more than 50 such
isolated mountain plateaus here,

25:00.740 --> 25:03.740
each home to a unique
community of plants.

25:08.660 --> 25:13.020
Downpours are so torrential
that no soil can accumulate

25:13.020 --> 25:15.660
on their broad, rocky summits,

25:15.660 --> 25:18.980
and some plants living up here
have to find their nutrients

25:18.980 --> 25:20.740
from another source.

25:28.260 --> 25:31.100
These are Bromeliads.

25:35.580 --> 25:40.100
Their leaves are shaped like
a funnel and collect rainwater,

25:40.100 --> 25:42.140
which accumulates in the centre.

25:47.660 --> 25:52.580
This small pond is colonised
by all kinds of tiny animals.

26:01.220 --> 26:04.900
And it is their bodies,
when they die, that provide

26:04.900 --> 26:07.500
some of the nutrients
the Bromeliads need.

26:09.700 --> 26:14.260
This makes a good partnership
in which both parties can thrive.

26:15.500 --> 26:17.460
But...

26:17.460 --> 26:20.220
..it can be exploited

26:20.220 --> 26:21.740
by a plant predator.

26:52.220 --> 26:56.460
This probing stem belongs to a plant
called a bladderwort.

26:58.420 --> 27:01.340
It, too, is in need of nutrients.

27:09.940 --> 27:14.700
And a well-stocked Bromeliad pool
is just the place to find them.

27:18.180 --> 27:21.500
This one is full of aquatic animals.

27:48.540 --> 27:50.980
The bladderwort begins to change...

27:53.460 --> 27:55.740
..into a hunter.

27:57.900 --> 28:00.940
It develops bladders

28:00.940 --> 28:04.940
and removes sufficient
of the water within them

28:04.940 --> 28:07.380
to create a partial vacuum.

28:11.420 --> 28:15.980
Each bladder has a trap door
beside it with trigger hairs.

28:18.660 --> 28:21.860
Now all the bladderwort has to do...

28:24.060 --> 28:26.540
..is to bide its time.

28:46.180 --> 28:49.140
It only takes one touch

28:49.140 --> 28:51.540
for the trap door to snap open...

28:54.300 --> 28:56.500
..and suck in its prey.

29:03.540 --> 29:06.420
It's all over in a millisecond.

29:16.580 --> 29:20.700
And after it has fed, a bladderwort
has enough energy

29:20.700 --> 29:23.460
to produce another tendril

29:23.460 --> 29:26.460
to search for another
Bromeliad pool.

29:41.860 --> 29:45.580
Swamps and bogs are also
poor in nutrients.

29:48.460 --> 29:52.780
So several plants that live in
such places catch insects too,

29:52.780 --> 29:54.460
if they can.

30:07.020 --> 30:12.900
The leaves of Sundews are
covered with long, red hairs,

30:12.900 --> 30:14.980
each tipped with a droplet.

30:34.220 --> 30:37.300
These glistening globules are,

30:37.300 --> 30:39.300
in fact, glue.

30:55.900 --> 31:01.380
Once the Sundews detect the taste
of their victim's body,

31:01.380 --> 31:04.780
they flood it with
digestive enzymes.

31:14.660 --> 31:17.540
The little body disintegrates.

31:21.980 --> 31:25.500
And the Sundew gets
the nutrients it needs.

31:31.380 --> 31:35.020
Another plant has
an even more elaborate way

31:35.020 --> 31:36.140
of catching a meal.

31:43.060 --> 31:46.780
The Venus Flytrap has leaves
that are lined

31:46.780 --> 31:48.740
with interlocking teeth.

31:54.020 --> 31:57.780
It attracts insects by producing
a sweet perfume,

31:57.780 --> 31:59.700
just as a flower does.

32:02.100 --> 32:04.980
It, too, has a hair trigger.

32:17.180 --> 32:19.900
And another insect is caught.

32:33.140 --> 32:36.660
But the technique is more complex
than it might seem.

32:40.620 --> 32:44.060
The Venus Flytrap has a problem.

32:44.060 --> 32:47.140
It needs to avoid false alarms,

32:47.140 --> 32:52.260
snapping shut on something
inedible, like a raindrop

32:52.260 --> 32:54.860
or a little bit of twig.

32:54.860 --> 32:58.660
That would be a waste
of both time and energy.

32:58.660 --> 33:01.460
So how does it avoid that?

33:01.460 --> 33:05.140
Well, it does it by counting.

33:05.140 --> 33:07.500
If I touch this one,

33:07.500 --> 33:09.580
sensitive hair just there...

33:12.220 --> 33:14.060
..no reaction.

33:14.060 --> 33:18.300
That could be a false alarm,
but the plant remembers that

33:18.300 --> 33:20.300
for 20 seconds.

33:20.300 --> 33:23.980
And if I touch it a second
time within that time,

33:23.980 --> 33:27.900
then that's much more likely
to be worth eating.

33:27.900 --> 33:28.940
And so...

33:31.580 --> 33:32.620
..it closes.

33:35.660 --> 33:41.260
So far, so good, but now it
needs to be absolutely certain

33:41.260 --> 33:44.180
that it's got something
worth eating,

33:44.180 --> 33:46.420
so it continues counting.

33:46.420 --> 33:51.740
Only after it has totted up five
separate touches to those hairs

33:51.740 --> 33:57.140
will it give the final squeeze
and then begin to produce the liquid

33:57.140 --> 34:01.100
from the surface of the leaf,
which will dissolve the body

34:01.100 --> 34:03.020
of its unfortunate victim.

34:06.060 --> 34:10.140
The Flytrap now has enough
energy to produce flowers

34:10.140 --> 34:13.500
and attract pollinating insects.

34:23.540 --> 34:29.820
Wind and insects between them
pollinate virtually all land plants,

34:29.820 --> 34:33.540
but neither method can be used
by plants that live

34:33.540 --> 34:35.740
entirely underwater.

34:35.740 --> 34:38.260
So some lead double lives.

34:41.660 --> 34:46.100
A chalk stream in southern England,
and swaying in the current

34:46.100 --> 34:49.460
is a plant for which these rivers
are famous.

34:50.620 --> 34:55.580
This is water-crowfoot,
a kind of aquatic buttercup.

34:55.580 --> 34:59.300
For most of the year,
it is underwater.

34:59.300 --> 35:02.900
And if I take this
underwater camera...

35:05.980 --> 35:10.100
..you can see its floppy stems
grow horizontally.

35:10.100 --> 35:13.500
That reduces the risk of being
swept away by the current.

35:16.740 --> 35:20.500
But each spring, when it's
time to flower, it produces

35:20.500 --> 35:22.660
something crucially different...

35:24.980 --> 35:29.980
..a stem that is stiff enough
to resist the current

35:29.980 --> 35:33.260
and lift its flowers
into the air above.

35:53.420 --> 35:57.100
And now, of course,
they can get help from insects.

36:13.380 --> 36:15.940
So every year, in part, at least,

36:15.940 --> 36:19.500
water-crowfoot becomes
a land plant...

36:22.500 --> 36:26.660
..and provides us with one of
the loveliest natural spectacles

36:26.660 --> 36:28.380
of the early English summer.

36:38.100 --> 36:42.180
Water-crowfoot is not the only
water plant to lift its flowers

36:42.180 --> 36:43.220
above the surface.

36:49.140 --> 36:51.940
Plants do so all around the world.

36:57.660 --> 37:00.580
From the swamps of the Pantanal...

37:05.420 --> 37:09.060
..to the lakes of Thailand,

37:09.060 --> 37:12.060
they all burst
into spectacular bloom.

37:22.500 --> 37:26.540
Once they've been pollinated,
they produce seeds.

37:38.620 --> 37:41.500
And now their flowers
have done their job,

37:41.500 --> 37:46.140
some return to a life under water.

37:51.700 --> 37:56.140
Now they must ensure
that some of their seeds

37:56.140 --> 37:59.740
will find suitable places
in which to germinate.

38:13.300 --> 38:19.820
Bullrushes every year produce
these long, brown, velvety objects.

38:21.060 --> 38:23.780
Look what happens
when I break one open.

38:27.300 --> 38:31.420
It contains almost
a quarter of a million seeds.

38:39.700 --> 38:43.260
Each seed is attached
to a delicate parachute.

38:49.860 --> 38:53.900
Even the slightest breeze
will lift it and may carry it

38:53.900 --> 38:56.260
for very long distances indeed.

38:58.540 --> 39:02.700
So even though suitable
stretches of fresh water are few

39:02.700 --> 39:06.580
and far between, there's
a good chance that at least one

39:06.580 --> 39:08.980
will end up in a place
where it can grow.

39:18.060 --> 39:21.700
Much bigger seeds, of course,
can't travel by air.

39:29.900 --> 39:32.260
A river can provide transport,

39:32.260 --> 39:37.060
but it's a one-way
journey downstream

39:37.060 --> 39:39.260
that often ends up in the sea.

39:42.660 --> 39:44.620
And that's not ideal.

39:47.220 --> 39:52.580
So how can any riverside plant
avoid this and travel upstream?

39:55.220 --> 39:58.260
Here, along the Bonito River
in Brazil,

39:58.260 --> 40:02.580
a variety of trees manage
to do exactly that.

40:09.740 --> 40:14.220
They embed their seeds in the middle
of soft, sweet fruit.

40:31.340 --> 40:35.260
Monkeys, such as these capuchins,

40:35.260 --> 40:38.660
make a meal of them
just as soon as they're ripe.

40:43.620 --> 40:47.540
But monkeys are very
wasteful feeders.

40:47.540 --> 40:52.180
And what's not eaten
ends up in the river

40:52.180 --> 40:54.580
and is washed away.

41:08.860 --> 41:10.740
But not all.

41:28.980 --> 41:34.020
In the fruiting season,
hundreds of Piraputanga fish

41:34.020 --> 41:35.860
gather beneath these trees.

41:44.900 --> 41:49.300
But the Piraputanga want more
than the monkeys' leftovers.

41:51.820 --> 41:56.420
The brightly coloured fruits are
clearly visible, even to the fish

41:56.420 --> 41:57.620
in the water below.

42:07.140 --> 42:09.980
And some manage to claim them

42:09.980 --> 42:11.980
even before a monkey does.

42:25.860 --> 42:28.660
This isn't a skill mastered
by just one particularly

42:28.660 --> 42:31.420
successful acrobatic fish.

42:31.420 --> 42:34.540
Many of the Piraputanga can do this.

42:40.100 --> 42:43.100
Nor is this a disaster for the tree.

42:49.300 --> 42:50.700
Far from it.

42:56.700 --> 43:00.020
These Piraputanga are migratory,

43:00.020 --> 43:03.580
heading many miles upriver to spawn.

43:11.540 --> 43:15.340
The trees, by enticing
the fish to eat their fruits,

43:15.340 --> 43:18.580
have a perfect means of transport
for their seeds.

43:20.100 --> 43:25.580
With luck, the seeds will be
deposited many miles upstream.

43:43.420 --> 43:46.820
The ability to colonise new habitats

43:46.820 --> 43:51.740
has allowed one group of flowering
plants to venture out of fresh water

43:51.740 --> 43:56.300
and into a world that
may look the same to us,

43:56.300 --> 43:59.500
but for a plant
is crucially different.

44:02.820 --> 44:05.260
The much greater, saltier world...

44:06.820 --> 44:08.260
..the sea.

44:11.300 --> 44:16.900
This is a fruit from one of the most
important plants on the Earth today.

44:17.980 --> 44:19.500
Seagrass.

44:27.340 --> 44:31.220
This particular one is floating
off the coast of Formentera

44:31.220 --> 44:32.780
in the Mediterranean.

44:45.020 --> 44:49.820
100,000 years ago,
a seagrass seed like this

44:49.820 --> 44:52.580
sank to the sea floor just here.

45:07.580 --> 45:09.420
And, eventually, it produced...

45:11.060 --> 45:12.500
..a great meadow.

45:16.900 --> 45:21.460
A meadow that is still
flourishing today.

45:24.620 --> 45:27.420
It did so by cloning itself.

45:30.660 --> 45:33.540
Now over ten miles across,

45:33.540 --> 45:36.180
it's not only one
of the largest living

45:36.180 --> 45:38.460
organisms on Earth,

45:38.460 --> 45:40.580
it's also one of the oldest.

45:48.420 --> 45:53.060
And it supports a rich community
of many kinds of animals.

45:58.340 --> 46:01.580
It's become a kind of
marine savannah.

46:06.900 --> 46:10.220
Over 1,000 species now live here.

46:10.220 --> 46:14.020
Some, like these elegantly
camouflaged pipe fish,

46:14.020 --> 46:16.580
live nowhere else but
amongst the seagrass.

46:27.060 --> 46:30.300
Seagrass fringes
many of the world's coasts.

46:38.100 --> 46:40.100
Turtles depend upon it, too.

46:45.060 --> 46:48.740
And so do Dugong - animals
that are sometimes called,

46:48.740 --> 46:51.580
very appropriately, sea cows.

47:00.100 --> 47:04.580
Today, seagrass plays a critical
role in maintaining the health

47:04.580 --> 47:06.340
of our planet.

47:08.420 --> 47:11.580
It creates stores of carbon
around its roots

47:11.580 --> 47:13.860
at an enormous rate.

47:13.860 --> 47:17.820
35 times faster, in fact,
than plants that live on the floor

47:17.820 --> 47:19.620
of a tropical rainforest.

47:23.340 --> 47:25.500
Here in Formentera,

47:25.500 --> 47:28.780
it's possible to see,
beneath the living seagrass,

47:28.780 --> 47:31.420
layer upon layer of trapped carbon

47:31.420 --> 47:35.820
that the plants have accumulated
over the past 2,000 years.

47:42.740 --> 47:47.500
Seagrass, however, is easily
destroyed by human disturbance.

47:47.500 --> 47:51.500
A third of the world's underwater
meadows have already been lost,

47:51.500 --> 47:53.700
and many more are in decline.

48:02.020 --> 48:06.860
Biologists are now striving to not
only protect the remaining meadows,

48:06.860 --> 48:08.660
but to restore them.

48:11.780 --> 48:14.500
One plant at a time.

48:21.660 --> 48:24.660
Seagrass could be a valuable ally

48:24.660 --> 48:27.060
in our fight against climate change.

48:31.060 --> 48:35.300
Today, water worlds everywhere
are under threat.

48:40.660 --> 48:44.220
Many of their inhabitants
are disappearing

48:44.220 --> 48:47.020
without us even being aware
of their existence.

48:55.220 --> 48:59.420
The plants that grow in water
are probably the least noticeable.

48:59.420 --> 49:01.940
They're certainly the least studied.

49:01.940 --> 49:05.900
But the more you know about
the problems of living in that way,

49:05.900 --> 49:09.060
the greater the wonder
of their success.

49:10.820 --> 49:14.420
Surely they deserve
more of our attention

49:14.420 --> 49:15.900
and, most importantly,

49:15.900 --> 49:17.180
our care.

49:34.020 --> 49:37.900
This vast wetland is the Pantanal.

49:37.900 --> 49:41.980
The Water World's team are heading
to a plant battlefield.

49:43.220 --> 49:46.420
The home of Brazil's
giant water lily.

49:49.140 --> 49:51.860
This is like seeing
the end of a war.

49:51.860 --> 49:53.740
There are leaves growing
on top of each other,

49:53.740 --> 49:56.140
flowers going through leaves.

49:56.140 --> 49:57.540
Unbelievable!

49:59.860 --> 50:04.340
To capture this story in all
its detail would take over a year

50:04.340 --> 50:08.900
and require a unique Green Planet
approach, both filming here,

50:08.900 --> 50:11.900
and, in a parallel mini Pantanal,

50:11.900 --> 50:15.220
in deepest, darkest Devon.

50:18.820 --> 50:22.940
This is the unique world of
specialist time lapse cameraman

50:22.940 --> 50:24.460
Tim Shepherd.

50:27.340 --> 50:32.220
Tim has the reputation of being
able to think like a plant.

50:33.220 --> 50:37.060
It's absolutely crucial that
you get the plant really happy.

50:37.060 --> 50:40.540
And to make the giant lily
feel totally at home,

50:40.540 --> 50:44.220
Tim must build a little piece
of Brazilian wetland.

50:46.340 --> 50:49.100
First, a 10,000 litre tank.

50:52.380 --> 50:56.980
Hundreds of bricks,
almost 1,000 kilos of soil

50:56.980 --> 50:59.380
and countless cups of tea later,

50:59.380 --> 51:01.220
the foundations are complete.

51:02.820 --> 51:05.340
So far, so good.

51:05.340 --> 51:10.460
Now time to prepare for the
new green pellet camera system.

51:10.460 --> 51:14.020
We're trying to assemble
the main gantry framework

51:14.020 --> 51:17.220
so that we can mount the
moving rig on top of it.

51:17.220 --> 51:20.020
So it's a bit of a fiddle
to get all the screws

51:20.020 --> 51:22.220
in all the right places, basically.

51:23.580 --> 51:27.140
After a few weeks,
the building works are complete.

51:28.460 --> 51:30.620
The flood can now begin.

51:37.700 --> 51:41.020
Tim needs to be sure
everything in the room is heated

51:41.020 --> 51:42.860
to tropical temperatures...

51:47.540 --> 51:50.540
..before the star of the scene
can move in.

51:53.180 --> 51:58.620
Carefully grown at the Royal Botanic
Gardens at Kew, especially for us.

52:02.900 --> 52:06.500
Everything depends
on this one plant.

52:06.500 --> 52:09.780
There will be no time
for a second attempt.

52:11.460 --> 52:14.100
And even more important for Tim

52:14.100 --> 52:17.420
to keep his guest happy and healthy.

52:17.420 --> 52:19.980
This big monster need a lot
of feeding.

52:19.980 --> 52:24.300
We found we need about
five sand bags full of compost

52:24.300 --> 52:28.340
every two or three weeks,
so we just sort of lower them in

52:28.340 --> 52:30.460
and stick them down by the roots.

52:30.460 --> 52:32.500
There you go.

52:32.500 --> 52:35.900
Whilst the Devon giant settles in,

52:35.900 --> 52:40.580
the Pantanal crew are continuing
to get their shots.

52:40.580 --> 52:43.860
Time to see some giant
water lilies underwater.

52:43.860 --> 52:46.740
And I hope there's no anaconda.

52:53.300 --> 52:55.740
Ooh! Mission accomplished!

52:59.260 --> 53:01.300
The pressure is now on Tim.

53:04.820 --> 53:09.700
After months of pampering, the
giant lily is ready for action.

53:11.820 --> 53:16.300
First thing to film is a leaf spike
rising up from the depths.

53:18.740 --> 53:21.500
Luckily, there are
no anacondas here.

53:23.780 --> 53:26.980
The special camera
weighs over 40 kilos.

53:26.980 --> 53:29.820
It's suddenly become less heavy,
which is good.

53:29.820 --> 53:33.860
The new rig means Tim
will be able to follow

53:33.860 --> 53:36.180
the emerging plant in any direction.

53:41.420 --> 53:43.540
Wow, fancy!

53:45.180 --> 53:47.380
The technology is working well,

53:47.380 --> 53:51.300
but nature is starting
to derail Tim's plans.

53:51.300 --> 53:53.420
We're tangled up in all these weeds.

53:55.260 --> 53:59.380
What happens is we've got a bit
of an ecosystem developing here

53:59.380 --> 54:03.700
and, before you know it,
you get masses and masses of algae

54:03.700 --> 54:06.060
growing in amongst it all.

54:06.060 --> 54:08.580
Cor!

54:08.580 --> 54:12.700
Think I've just released
some anaerobic gases there.

54:12.700 --> 54:15.540
No, not me, the algae!

54:16.860 --> 54:20.900
State of the art tools
help keep the algae at bay.

54:24.700 --> 54:25.740
Eurgh!

54:32.100 --> 54:35.540
Just in time for Tim
to film lift-off.

54:47.900 --> 54:50.780
That's quite nice coming out
of the water, look at that!

54:50.780 --> 54:54.340
Tim's focus can now shift to the
battle that's starting to take place

54:54.340 --> 54:55.380
on the surface.

54:59.100 --> 55:02.660
I'm trying to film this new bud
coming out on this lily leaf.

55:02.660 --> 55:06.540
Give or take about three days
to grow from where it is now.

55:06.540 --> 55:09.500
Somewhere in this zone between
these two other leaves.

55:09.500 --> 55:11.700
I want that to last
about ten seconds.

55:11.700 --> 55:14.980
Ten seconds is about 250 frames.

55:14.980 --> 55:17.660
That works out about
one frame every 20 minutes.

55:19.540 --> 55:23.060
But plants don't read scripts.

55:23.060 --> 55:26.860
It's nature, it doesn't always do
what you think it's going to do.

55:32.940 --> 55:36.540
We've had a few false starts where
the leaf has swung out of shot

55:36.540 --> 55:38.020
and gone somewhere else.

55:43.740 --> 55:46.380
Or it just grows a lot quicker
than you thought.

55:50.180 --> 55:52.740
It's a challenge
to get things right.

55:52.740 --> 55:56.900
But with the combination of Tim's
expertise and the new camera system,

55:56.900 --> 55:59.900
results are starting to look good.

55:59.900 --> 56:02.860
I think the difference now
with this series is we can bring

56:02.860 --> 56:07.660
the plants much more to life
as characters and tell their story

56:07.660 --> 56:09.620
in a much more dynamic way.

56:11.860 --> 56:17.140
It's great to be able to follow them
around much more with the way

56:17.140 --> 56:18.980
you'd film an animal behaving.

56:26.420 --> 56:30.980
These rigs have given us a whole
new realm of possibilities.

56:30.980 --> 56:34.100
After over a year
of filming and recording

56:34.100 --> 56:36.580
100,000 separate images,

56:36.580 --> 56:41.500
the secret life of the giant water
lily and the battle of the Pantanal

56:41.500 --> 56:43.340
has been revealed.

56:49.540 --> 56:52.300
Next time on The Green Planet,

56:52.300 --> 56:55.660
the ever changing seasonal world,

56:55.660 --> 56:59.500
full of hunters, tricksters

56:59.500 --> 57:01.340
and unlikely alliances.

57:04.460 --> 57:09.100
Plants here are in a race
against the clock.

57:09.100 --> 57:11.460
Timing is everything.

57:14.060 --> 57:17.580
The Open University
has produced a poster

57:17.580 --> 57:22.460
that explores the vital role
that plants have for our planet.

57:22.460 --> 57:25.180
