39:36.720 --> 39:40.390
But I thought it would be fair.

39:40.540 --> 39:43.550
A lot of talk in the press
about rifts with your brother.

39:43.640 --> 39:45.640
How much of that is true?

39:45.730 --> 39:50.220
Part of this family being under
the pressure that it's under,

39:50.240 --> 39:52.570
Stuff happens.

39:52.800 --> 39:58.650
But we're brothers and we'll
always be brothers.

39:58.750 --> 40:02.730
We certainly are on different
paths at the moment.

40:02.750 --> 40:06.590
Not many people have asked
if I'm okay.

40:06.740 --> 40:13.930
But it's uh, a very real thing
to be going through

40:14.080 --> 40:15.820
Behind the scenes.

40:15.910 --> 40:20.170
What we need to do now is focus
on being real,

40:20.270 --> 40:23.080
And focus on being the people
that we are,

40:23.100 --> 40:26.010
And standing up for what
we believe in.

40:26.170 --> 40:29.000
I will not be bullied into,

40:29.020 --> 40:34.780
Into playing a game
that killed my mum.

40:38.100 --> 40:40.270
The emotion.

40:40.290 --> 40:41.700
It... It feels very real to me.

40:41.850 --> 40:43.290
Of course it's real.

40:43.520 --> 40:45.370
That's what makes it
so bloody powerful.

40:45.460 --> 40:47.460
It's just like your mother's
interview for the bbc.

40:47.690 --> 40:50.800
She was manipulated
into giving that interview.

40:51.020 --> 40:55.690
But still, I, I can't believe
she said all that.

40:55.710 --> 40:58.140
Goes and tells the world
about camilla,

40:58.290 --> 41:01.030
The infighting with dad.

41:01.050 --> 41:02.620
Even her affair with hewitt.

41:02.720 --> 41:04.380
I bloody trusted that man.

41:04.540 --> 41:06.130
She had him take us riding,

41:06.150 --> 41:07.310
Showed us around
the guard stables,

41:07.540 --> 41:10.320
And all the while he
and my mother were...

41:10.540 --> 41:11.710
Yeah.

41:11.800 --> 41:14.230
And how did I find out
about it?

41:14.380 --> 41:15.470
By watching it all on telly

41:15.490 --> 41:18.220
Along with the rest
of the world.

41:18.230 --> 41:19.720
I was 13.

41:19.740 --> 41:22.160
I know.

41:22.310 --> 41:23.900
Do you know I think my heart
first went out to you

41:24.060 --> 41:26.220
Right then and there?

41:26.240 --> 41:28.830
Long before we'd ever met.

41:28.990 --> 41:32.080
Must've been so painful,
my darling.

41:32.230 --> 41:35.400
My housemaster at eton.

41:35.490 --> 41:38.160
He set up his own study
as a private place for me

41:38.250 --> 41:41.910
To watch it all on telly.

41:41.920 --> 41:43.240
I cried my bloody eyes out.

41:43.260 --> 41:44.670
I know.

41:44.690 --> 41:46.140
I know you did.

41:48.600 --> 41:51.690
Did you see "it?"

41:51.920 --> 41:53.100
Yes.

41:53.250 --> 41:54.600
My mother did revealing
interviews like this

41:54.750 --> 41:56.590
When she was preparing to leave
the firm.

41:56.610 --> 41:59.700
Well, a separation would be best
for everyone.

41:59.930 --> 42:02.850
But it must be done right,
on palace terms.

42:02.870 --> 42:05.020
They can't be allowed to
bugger off with all of the glory

42:05.110 --> 42:06.350
And none of the burden.

42:06.370 --> 42:07.690
While I'm left holding the bag.

42:07.780 --> 42:09.600
No, not on my watch, sir.

42:09.620 --> 42:11.940
Well, I have just been told

42:11.950 --> 42:15.550
That the sussex clan is taking
a hiatus.

42:15.700 --> 42:17.200
Six weeks.

42:17.220 --> 42:19.290
They claim they need
some time off.

42:19.390 --> 42:20.220
Let me guess.

42:20.450 --> 42:21.780
In barbados.

42:21.800 --> 42:23.540
Canada.

42:23.560 --> 42:25.620
Well it's, it's commonwealth
at least.

42:25.630 --> 42:28.880
And I'm told they're starting
a new personal website

42:28.970 --> 42:30.470
Run for them privately.

42:30.620 --> 42:33.640
They're calling it sussex royal.

42:33.790 --> 42:35.220
Sounds like a hotel.

42:35.240 --> 42:38.960
But it will be made entirely
outside palace purview.

42:38.980 --> 42:42.560
They will control the brand.

42:42.580 --> 42:44.560
This is precisely
why I suggested

42:44.650 --> 42:46.320
That only your children

42:46.470 --> 42:49.990
Be given the titles of prince
and princess when I am king.

42:50.140 --> 42:52.140
But you're not king.

42:52.160 --> 42:54.660
So what do you suggest
I do in the meantime?

42:54.810 --> 42:58.820
We shall use what I believe
is called "cancel culture."

42:58.830 --> 43:00.910
We can't exactly cancel
the most woke bloke

43:01.000 --> 43:03.150
And his feminist bride.

43:03.170 --> 43:06.100
Well, the firm can cancel
their royalness

43:06.330 --> 43:09.010
And prevent them from stealing
the brand.

43:09.100 --> 43:10.340

43:10.500 --> 43:13.920
With permission, I'd like
to ask the firm

of harry and meghan

43:16.090 --> 43:18.850
From the royal foundation
website.

43:19.000 --> 43:22.860
This would send a clear message
to them and to the world,

43:23.010 --> 43:26.530
Literally and figuratively
that the firm has cut them out.

43:26.620 --> 43:28.010

the royal purse.

Everything okay?

There's no photo of us
on her desk.

Everything in that frame
is intentional.

we're not part of this family.
