WEBVTT

00:02.001 --> 00:03.211
- LAST TIME ON
<i>HOT IN CLEVELAND,</i>

00:03.294 --> 00:06.089
JOY MET GEORGE,
A GREAT GUY

00:06.172 --> 00:08.048
WHO ONLY HAD
THREE MONTHS TO LIVE.

00:08.132 --> 00:10.176
BUT WHILE JOY
WAS HELPING GEORGE

00:10.260 --> 00:12.053
CROSS THINGS
OFF HIS BUCKET LIST,

00:12.137 --> 00:14.764
SHE FELL FOR HIM--HARD.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.140
- WHO ARE YOU?

00:16.224 --> 00:19.018
- YOUR NEW BOYFRIEND.
GET USED TO IT.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.147
[laughter]

00:22.230 --> 00:24.941
- AH, WE DID IT, JOY.

00:25.024 --> 00:27.485
TO RIO AND BACK
IN UNDER 24 HOURS.

00:27.569 --> 00:30.280
- WHERE'S YOUR BUCKET LIST?
- OH!

00:30.363 --> 00:32.448
- I AM OFFICIALLY
CROSSING OFF

00:32.531 --> 00:36.870
"FLY TO BRAZIL FOR
A TRULY GREAT CUP OF COFFEE."

00:36.953 --> 00:39.289
OH, I HADN'T NOTICED
THIS ONE.

00:39.372 --> 00:42.625
"SLEEP WITH 300 WOMEN."

00:42.709 --> 00:45.253
- DID I WRITE THAT?
- IT'S UNDERLINED TWICE

00:45.336 --> 00:46.796
AND ALL IN CAPS.
- [sighs]

00:46.880 --> 00:48.131
- GEORGE!

00:48.214 --> 00:49.632
YOU ONLY HAVE
THREE MONTHS TO LIVE!

00:49.716 --> 00:51.634
HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY
SLEEP WITH 300 WOMEN?

00:51.718 --> 00:53.303
- HMM, YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:53.386 --> 00:55.096
HOW ABOUT I JUST
SLEEP WITH YOU 300 TIMES?

00:55.180 --> 00:56.890
- [laughs]
IN THREE MONTHS?

00:56.973 --> 00:58.808
- WELL, IT'S ONLY,
LIKE, 3 1/2 TIMES A DAY.

00:58.892 --> 01:02.020
- HUH, WELL,
WE ALREADY DID THE HALF ONE.

01:02.103 --> 01:03.980
- YEAH,
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

01:04.063 --> 01:05.690
YOU KNOW,
HAVING SEX ON THE BEACH

01:05.774 --> 01:07.275
SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA,
BUT THEN THERE'S ALL THE SAND

01:07.358 --> 01:08.651
AND THE BOTTLE CAPS,

01:08.735 --> 01:11.821
AND THAT KID
WITH THE LOST SOCCER BALL.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.490
MARRY ME, JOY.

01:13.573 --> 01:15.158
- WHAT?

01:15.241 --> 01:17.118
WE HARDLY KNOW EACH OTHER.
- WHAT'S TO KNOW?

01:17.202 --> 01:19.496
I'VE ONLY GOT THREE MONTHS.
HOW BAD COULD IT BE?

01:19.579 --> 01:22.040
- YOU'RE RIGHT,
THERE'S NOTHING SO AWFUL

01:22.123 --> 01:24.667
YOU CAN'T PUT UP WITH IT
FOR THREE MONTHS.

01:24.751 --> 01:27.003
AND SUDDENLY,
THAT DOESN'T SOUND ROMANTIC.

01:27.086 --> 01:30.507
- HMM, TO THE CONTRARY,
IT'S NOTHING BUT ROMANTIC.

01:30.590 --> 01:31.633
ALL WE'LL HAVE
IS THE HONEYMOON--

01:31.716 --> 01:33.927
A THREE-MONTH HONEYMOON.

01:34.010 --> 01:35.678
TRAVEL THE WORLD WITH ME.

01:35.762 --> 01:39.182
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.
I'M NOT AN IMPULSIVE PERSON.

01:39.265 --> 01:41.017
- AND I HATE THAT ABOUT YOU.

01:41.100 --> 01:43.895
BUT I ONLY HAVE TO PUT UP
WITH IT FOR THREE MONTHS!

01:43.978 --> 01:46.022
- TRUE!

01:46.105 --> 01:48.691
- [clears throat]

01:48.775 --> 01:50.819
- I HATE WHEN YOU
CLEAR YOUR THROAT LIKE THAT.

01:50.902 --> 01:53.988
BUT I'D ONLY HAVE TO PUT UP
WITH IT FOR THREE MONTHS!

01:56.866 --> 01:58.827
- THAT IS THE UGLIEST SHIRT
I HAVE EVER SEEN,

01:58.910 --> 02:02.372
AND I DATED JIMMY BUFFET.

02:02.455 --> 02:05.333
- I STOLE IT OUT OF
GEORGE'S BAG THIS MORNING.

02:05.416 --> 02:07.085
I TOLD HIM I COULD PUT UP
WITH ANYTHING FOR THREE MONTHS,

02:07.168 --> 02:09.838
BUT THIS SHIRT
IS TOO HIDEOUS,

02:09.920 --> 02:12.340
ESPECIALLY NOW THAT
I'M GOING TO BE...HIS WIFE!

02:12.423 --> 02:14.050
- WHAT?
- ARE YOU K--WHAT?

02:14.133 --> 02:17.679
- I GIVE IT TWO MONTHS.

02:19.597 --> 02:21.516
- HE HAS THREE MONTHS
TO LIVE.

02:21.599 --> 02:25.687
- I KNOW.

02:25.770 --> 02:26.896
- WE'RE GETTING MARRIED
ON FRIDAY,

02:26.980 --> 02:28.356
THEN WE'RE TRAVELING
THE WORLD TOGETHER.

02:28.439 --> 02:32.277
- JOY, ARE YOU SURE
YOU'VE THOUGHT THIS THROUGH?

02:32.360 --> 02:33.903
- YOU KNOW,
OBVIOUSLY NOT.

02:33.987 --> 02:37.031
I MEAN, HOW ARE YOU
GOING TO PACK FOR THREE MONTHS?

02:37.115 --> 02:40.076
- I KNOW I'M RUSHING INTO THIS,
BUT WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE?

02:40.159 --> 02:42.745
GEORGE DOESN'T HAVE MUCH TIME,
AND I TRULY ADORE HIM.

02:42.829 --> 02:45.373
YOU'RE DOING
A GOOD THING, JOY.

02:45.456 --> 02:50.169
HAVING YOU FOR A WIFE
WILL MAKE DYING MUCH EASIER.

02:52.338 --> 02:54.299
- YOU'RE JUST MAD BECAUSE
YOU CAN NO LONGER CALL ME

02:54.382 --> 02:55.925
"THE SPINSTER SCROGGS."

02:56.009 --> 02:58.928
- HMM, "THE WIDOW SCROGGS"
DOES HAVE A CLASSIC RING.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.096
- AREN'T YOU GONNA
TAKE HIS LAST NAME?

03:00.179 --> 03:01.222
YOU'VE ALWAYS HATED YOURS.

03:01.306 --> 03:03.224
- YES, BUT GEORGE'S
IS WORSE.

03:03.308 --> 03:04.475
- WELL, HOW MUCH WORSE
COULD IT BE?

03:04.559 --> 03:06.477
- BELIEVE ME,
IT'S GROSS.

03:06.561 --> 03:07.854
- WELL, COME ON,
IT CAN'T BE THAT BAD.

03:07.937 --> 03:11.316
- HIS LAST NAME
IS "GROSS."

03:11.399 --> 03:13.610
I'D BE "THE WIDOW GROSS."
[doorbell rings]

03:13.693 --> 03:15.111
- OH, I WONDER
WHO THAT COULD BE.

03:15.194 --> 03:18.114
- PROBABLY MY TWIN SISTER.

03:18.197 --> 03:19.282
- YOUR WHAT?

03:19.365 --> 03:21.451
- YOU HAVE A TWIN?
- ELKA...

03:21.534 --> 03:23.620
WHY DID YOU
NEVER MENTION THIS?

03:23.703 --> 03:27.290
- I'M AN ENIGMA,
WRAPPED INSIDE A CONUNDRUM,

03:27.373 --> 03:30.126
SHROUDED IN DIMPLES.

03:30.209 --> 03:32.337
- WHY HASN'T
SHE VISITED BEFORE?

03:32.420 --> 03:34.589
- WE HAD A BIG FIGHT.

03:34.672 --> 03:37.800
WE HAVEN'T SPOKEN IN 40 YEARS!
[doorbell rings]

03:37.884 --> 03:41.137
BUT JOY'S DYING GUY
GOT ME THINKING,

03:41.220 --> 03:43.932
MAYBE IT'S TIME
WE LET BYGONES BE BYGONES.

03:44.015 --> 03:46.100
- OH, THAT'S SO SWEET.
YOU'RE GONNA PATCH THINGS UP.

03:46.184 --> 03:48.478
[doorbell rings]

03:48.561 --> 03:51.189
- I FORGOT
HOW NEEDY SHE WAS.

03:51.272 --> 03:55.318
I'M ANNOYED ALREADY.

04:01.991 --> 04:02.867
- ELKA!

04:02.951 --> 04:06.037
- ANKA!
[laughter]

04:07.705 --> 04:10.375
both: AH...

04:10.458 --> 04:14.253
both: YOU LOOK TERRIBLE!

04:23.137 --> 04:26.015
- WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
TO OUR FACE?

04:26.099 --> 04:27.016
{\an8}- ME?

04:27.100 --> 04:30.103
{\an8}WHAT ABOUT YOU?
"NATURAL AGING."

04:30.186 --> 04:33.314
{\an8}DISGUSTING!

04:33.398 --> 04:37.318
{\an8}- WHERE'S THE FAMOUS
OSTROVSKY NECK FRECKLE?

04:37.402 --> 04:38.861
{\an8}YOU HAD IT REMOVED!

04:38.945 --> 04:40.530
{\an8}- OH, PLEASE.

04:40.613 --> 04:46.119
{\an8}AFTER FIVE FACELIFTS,
IT'S ON MY FOREHEAD!

04:46.202 --> 04:48.037
{\an8}- OH, ANKA, WOULD YOU LIKE
SOMETHING TO EAT?

04:48.121 --> 04:49.580
{\an8}- OH, NO,
THANK YOU, NO.

04:49.664 --> 04:52.375
{\an8}I COULDN'T EAT WITH THAT
FREAKISH THING IN THE ROOM.

04:52.458 --> 04:55.503
{\an8}- YEAH, JOY PUTS ME
OFF MY FOOD TOO.

04:55.586 --> 04:57.338
{\an8}- NO, NO, NO,
I--I MEANT THE SHIRT.

04:57.422 --> 05:01.050
{\an8}- RELAX, I'M TOSSING IT
IN THE RUBBISH RIGHT NOW.

05:01.134 --> 05:04.053
{\an8}- SO, 40 YEARS.
THAT MUST'VE BEEN SOME FIGHT.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.347
{\an8}- HORRIBLE.
- OH, VICIOUS.

05:06.431 --> 05:08.599
{\an8}- WHAT WAS IT ABOUT AGAIN?

05:08.683 --> 05:12.478
{\an8}- OH, CRAP.
ALZHEIMER'S!

05:14.439 --> 05:15.732
{\an8}HAS IT GOTTEN
TO THE POINT

05:15.815 --> 05:19.610
{\an8}WHERE SHE THINKS
KLEENEX IS MONEY?

05:20.820 --> 05:23.239
{\an8}- OKAY, SO WHAT WAS
THE FIGHT ABOUT?

05:23.322 --> 05:25.366
{\an8}- [sighs]

05:25.450 --> 05:27.785
{\an8}WELL,
I DON'T REMEMBER.

05:27.869 --> 05:29.579
{\an8}WAS IT WHEN
I PRETENDED TO BE YOU

05:29.662 --> 05:31.039
{\an8}AND SLEPT WITH
YOUR BOYFRIEND?

05:31.122 --> 05:32.582
{\an8}- NO.

05:32.665 --> 05:35.501
{\an8}WAS IT WHEN
I PRETENDED TO BE YOU

05:35.585 --> 05:38.588
{\an8}AND ESCAPED FROM POLAND?

05:38.671 --> 05:40.798
- NO.

05:40.882 --> 05:42.592
WHAT ABOUT A DRINK?

05:42.675 --> 05:44.594
- IT'S 9:00 A.M.!

05:44.677 --> 05:49.682
- VODKA THEN.
- SURE!

05:54.312 --> 05:57.982
[phone rings]

05:58.066 --> 06:00.943
- OH!
IT'S MY HUSBAND-TO-BE.

06:01.027 --> 06:03.780
HELLO,
HUSBAND-TO-BE.

06:03.863 --> 06:05.406
YOUR LUCKY FLOWERED SHIRT
IS MISSING?

06:05.490 --> 06:07.116
YEAH,
I KNOW THE ONE.

06:07.200 --> 06:11.287
I LOVE THAT SHIRT.

06:11.370 --> 06:15.875
I'M IN MY BEDROOM RIGHT NOW.
I'LL LOOK AROUND FOR IT.

06:17.168 --> 06:20.129
NOPE,
DON'T SEE IT ANYWHERE.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.422
WHAT?

06:21.506 --> 06:23.966
YOU WANT TO
BE BURIED IN IT?

06:24.050 --> 06:25.635
DON'T WORRY, I'LL FIND IT.
[truck beeping]

06:25.718 --> 06:30.139
I'VE GOT TO RETRIEVE THAT SHIRT
BEFORE THE TRASH MAN DOES!

06:30.223 --> 06:32.433
- HELLO, JOY!

06:32.517 --> 06:34.310
- OH, THANK GOD.

06:34.393 --> 06:36.020
- WELL, THIS IS GOING BETTER
THAN I THOUGHT.

06:36.104 --> 06:40.274
- TAKE OFF YOUR SHIRT.
- A LOT BETTER THAN I THOUGHT!

06:40.358 --> 06:42.819
- ARTIE, I NEED THAT SHIRT BACK.
IT'S MY FIANCE'S FAVORITE.

06:42.902 --> 06:44.320
HE'S DYING AND HE WANTS
TO BE BURIED IN IT.

06:44.403 --> 06:45.863
- OH, I'M SORRY.

06:45.947 --> 06:48.032
- THANK YOU, BUT WE'VE
MADE PEACE WITH IT, SO--

06:48.116 --> 06:51.452
- NO, NO, NO, I'M SORRY
I CAN'T GIVE YOU THE SHIRT BACK.

06:51.536 --> 06:54.622
I FOUND IT IN THE TRASH,
AND AS A FORMER HOMELESS MAN,

06:54.705 --> 06:57.458
I'M WELL-VERSED
IN THE 1988 LANDMARK DECISION,

06:57.542 --> 07:01.003
FINDERS V. WEEPERS.

07:01.087 --> 07:02.463
- ARTIE,
YOU'RE A BILLIONAIRE NOW.

07:02.547 --> 07:04.465
SURELY YOU CAN BUY YOURSELF
100 HIDEOUS SHIRTS.

07:04.549 --> 07:07.552
- PERHAPS. OR PERHAPS
I WILL HOLD THIS ONE HOSTAGE.

07:07.635 --> 07:09.387
- FOR WHAT?
MONEY?

07:09.470 --> 07:12.431
- NO, FOR LOVE!
THE LOVE OF A GOOD WOMAN!

07:12.515 --> 07:16.018
JOY, I NEED YOU TO GIVE ME
A MAKEOVER SO I CAN FIND ONE!

07:16.102 --> 07:18.187
- WAIT, WHAT HAPPENED TO
THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE, PRESHI,

07:18.271 --> 07:19.689
FROM THE RUBBER BALL?

07:19.772 --> 07:22.358
- AH, I AM A FIRESTONE,
OF FIRESTONE RUBBER.

07:22.441 --> 07:25.027
SHE IS AN ELMER,
OF ELMER'S GLUE.

07:25.111 --> 07:28.739
WHEN OUR FAMILIES REALIZED
I WAS RUBBER AND SHE WAS GLUE...

07:28.823 --> 07:33.202
WELL!

07:33.286 --> 07:35.037
- BUT I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO GIVE YOU A MAKEOVER.

07:35.121 --> 07:37.290
I'M GETTING MARRIED
IN TWO DAYS.

07:37.373 --> 07:39.167
- YOU KNOW WHAT, JOY?
WE'LL GIVE HIM A MAKEOVER.

07:39.250 --> 07:40.293
- YOU WILL?
- YEAH, WHY NOT.

07:40.376 --> 07:41.669
WE LIKE A GOOD CHALLENGE.

07:41.752 --> 07:43.546
- IT'S LIKE <i> MY FAIR LADY.</i>

07:43.629 --> 07:45.339
ELIZA DOOLITTLE ME!

07:45.423 --> 07:49.010
[Cockney accent]
I'M A GOOD GIRL, I AM!

07:49.093 --> 07:51.512
- WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?

07:51.596 --> 07:54.974
- HOLY MOLY! TWINS!

08:01.814 --> 08:03.733
- WHAT WAS
THAT FIGHT ABOUT?

08:03.816 --> 08:06.527
- WAS IT WHEN I SHOT YOU
IN THE SHOULDER?

08:06.611 --> 08:09.405
- OH, NO,
YOU WERE DRUNK.

08:09.488 --> 08:12.575
I'M SURE OUR FIGHT HAPPENED
WHEN WE WERE SOBER.

08:12.658 --> 08:16.412
- WELL,
THAT NARROWS IT DOWN.

08:16.495 --> 08:18.915
- OH, REALLY, MOM?

08:18.998 --> 08:21.083
YOU CAN'T MAKE IT IN TIME
TO THE WEDDING?

08:21.167 --> 08:22.793
OH, I'M SO DISAPPOINTED.

08:22.877 --> 08:25.379
[silently]
YES!

08:25.463 --> 08:28.132
WELL, WE'RE TRAVELING THE WORLD.
OF COURSE WE'LL STOP IN LONDON.

08:28.216 --> 08:29.884
[mouths silently]

08:29.967 --> 08:32.094
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

08:32.178 --> 08:34.597
- YOU KNOW,
WITH THAT ACCENT AND FIGURE,

08:34.679 --> 08:37.933
YOU REMIND ME OF A--
A GORGEOUS BRITISH MOVIE STAR.

08:38.017 --> 08:40.269
OH, UM, OH,
WELL-WHAT'S THE NAME?

08:40.352 --> 08:43.648
- KATE BECKINSALE?

08:43.731 --> 08:45.566
- NO.

08:45.650 --> 08:47.610
- WHO AM I THINKING OF?

08:47.693 --> 08:50.905
- HUGH GRANT.
- BINGO!

08:56.202 --> 08:57.453
- ALL RIGHT, ARTIE,
NOW YOU WALK INTO THE BAR

08:57.536 --> 09:00.289
AND SCAN THE ROOM.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.669
NOW YOU SPOT
A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN AT THE BAR.

09:04.752 --> 09:07.004
YOU APPROACH, SAY HELLO,

09:07.088 --> 09:11.467
AND THEN SAY THE FIRST THING
THAT COMES TO MIND.

09:11.550 --> 09:13.135
- HELLO.
- HELLO.

09:13.219 --> 09:18.766
- I WONDER HOW YOU'D LOOK
IN A VAT OF CREAMED CORN.

09:20.059 --> 09:21.477
- THE SECOND THING
THAT COMES TO MIND.

09:21.560 --> 09:24.981
- A VAT OF BAKED BEANS.

09:25.064 --> 09:27.775
- NO VATS.
THIRD THING.

09:27.858 --> 09:30.987
- I BET I COULD FIT
YOUR WHOLE HEAD IN MY MOUTH!

09:31.070 --> 09:32.321
- FOURTH THING.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.949
- YOU'RE A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN,

09:35.032 --> 09:37.368
YET THERE'S A SADNESS
BEHIND YOUR EYES.

09:37.451 --> 09:40.538
MAY I BUY YOU A DRINK?

09:40.621 --> 09:42.790
- YES!
THAT'S IT!

09:42.873 --> 09:45.001
ARTIE,
WHEN YOU'RE WITH A WOMAN,

09:45.084 --> 09:47.837
SAY ONLY THE FOURTH THING
THAT COMES TO MIND.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.339
- BY GEORGE,
I THINK I'VE GOT IT!

09:50.423 --> 09:56.012
AND NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I HAVE TO USE THE...

09:56.095 --> 10:00.016
MEN'S ROOM.

10:03.311 --> 10:04.854
- THAT WAS INCREDIBLE.
- [sighs]

10:04.937 --> 10:06.814
WANNA HEAR SOME MUSIC?
- SURE.

10:06.897 --> 10:09.191
- [sighs]

10:09.275 --> 10:11.986
[plucking ukulele]
- [laughs]

10:12.069 --> 10:13.362
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:13.446 --> 10:14.864
- DON'T TELL ME
I'M THE FIRST MAN

10:14.947 --> 10:18.409
YOU'VE BEEN WITH WHO PLAYS
THE POST-COITAL UKULELE.

10:18.492 --> 10:19.994
[plucking ukulele ]

10:20.077 --> 10:21.746
ANY REQUESTS?

10:21.829 --> 10:25.791
- DO YOU KNOW
THE REFRAIN FROM PLAYING?

10:27.752 --> 10:29.003
WHY DO I SMELL BANANAS?

10:29.086 --> 10:32.840
- I LIT MY MONKEY CANDLE.

10:32.923 --> 10:35.885
- BUT A MONKEY
DOESN'T SMELL LIKE A BANANA.

10:35.968 --> 10:39.680
- YOU WANT IT TO SMELL
LIKE BURNING MONKEYS?

10:39.764 --> 10:43.100
[laughter]

10:43.184 --> 10:44.894
- YOU'RE ADORABLE.

10:44.977 --> 10:46.729
YOU KNOW, IF I WEREN'T
ALREADY MARRYING YOU,

10:46.812 --> 10:48.064
I'D WANT TO MARRY YOU.

10:48.147 --> 10:50.900
- AWW.

10:50.983 --> 10:52.693
[clears throat loudly]

10:52.777 --> 10:54.695
SORRY.

10:54.779 --> 10:57.907
- THREE MONTHS.
[laughs]

10:57.990 --> 11:00.076
- HEY, I FINISHED WRITING
MY WEDDING VOWS THIS AFTERNOON.

11:00.159 --> 11:03.120
YOU WANNA HEAR 'EM?
- NO, THEY'LL ONLY MAKE ME CRY.

11:03.204 --> 11:04.914
- WOULD YOU RATHER
I PLAYED MY UKULELE AGAIN?

11:04.997 --> 11:08.042
- LET'S HEAR THOSE VOWS!

11:10.378 --> 11:12.046
- "JOY.

11:12.129 --> 11:15.132
"FROM THIS DAY ON,
I CHOOSE YOU TO BE MY WIFE.

11:15.216 --> 11:18.052
"I PLEDGE TO KISS YOU SLOWLY,
TO BE FOOD FOR YOUR SOUL,

11:18.135 --> 11:21.597
"TO SLEEP IN YOUR ARMS,
TO COMFORT YOU WITH MY BODY,

11:21.680 --> 11:23.682
"JUST AS YOU PROMISE
TO COMFORT ME WITH YOURS,

11:23.766 --> 11:26.268
"AND WE BOTH PROMISE
TO COMFORT NO OTHERS

11:26.352 --> 11:28.729
FOR THE REST OF ETERNITY."

11:28.813 --> 11:31.774
- WAIT, DID YOU JUST SAY
I CAN'T SLEEP WITH OTHER MEN

11:31.857 --> 11:34.402
AFTER YOU'RE GONE?

11:34.485 --> 11:37.154
- WELL, FOR,
YOU KNOW, ETERNITY.

11:37.238 --> 11:38.614
HEY, I'M NOT GONNA
HAVE ANY SEX EITHER.

11:38.697 --> 11:41.450
- BECAUSE YOU'LL BE DEAD!

11:41.534 --> 11:44.245
- OKAY, WHAT IF
I PROMISE TO OBSERVE

11:44.328 --> 11:47.081
A PROPER GRIEVING PERIOD?
HOW ABOUT SIX MONTHS?

11:47.164 --> 11:49.166
- 30 YEARS.
- NINE MONTHS.

11:49.250 --> 11:51.669
- TWO YEARS!
AND NOTHING BELOW THE BELT.

11:51.752 --> 11:54.130
- ONE YEAR,
FINAL OFFER.

11:54.213 --> 11:56.173
- OKAY, ONE YEAR,
BUT YOU HAVE TO PROMISE ME,

11:56.257 --> 11:57.466
THE FIRST PERSON
YOU HAVE SEX WITH AGAIN,

11:57.550 --> 11:58.634
YOU HAVE TO CRY OUT
MY NAME.

11:58.717 --> 12:00.803
- [laughs]
OH, GEORGE.

12:00.886 --> 12:05.516
- NO, MORE LIKE,
"OH! GEORGE!"

12:05.599 --> 12:08.310
UNLESS HIS NAME IS GEORGE,
AND THEN, SILENCE.

12:08.394 --> 12:11.188
- [laughs]

12:13.190 --> 12:15.484
- MELANIE,
YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL,

12:15.568 --> 12:18.571
I'D LIKE TO KEEP YOU
IN MY BASEMENT.

12:21.115 --> 12:22.950
- THAT WAS YOUR THIRD THOUGHT,
WASN'T IT?

12:23.033 --> 12:27.538
- YES.
I NEED THE FINGERS.

12:27.621 --> 12:28.956
YOU LOOK
BREATHTAKING TONIGHT.

12:29.039 --> 12:31.333
- AW, THANK YOU.

12:31.417 --> 12:34.128
FOURTH-THOUGHT ARTIE
IS A VERY CHARMING GUY.

12:34.211 --> 12:35.838
- OH! THIS IS
WHAT I WAS AFRAID OF!

12:35.921 --> 12:37.965
YOU CREATED
THE PERFECT MAN,

12:38.048 --> 12:40.676
AND NOW YOU'VE FALLEN IN LOVE
WITH YOUR CREATION.

12:40.759 --> 12:42.344
- NO, I HAVE NOT.

12:42.428 --> 12:44.513
- YOU HIDE IT WELL.

12:44.597 --> 12:47.057
- AND WE'RE DONE.

12:47.141 --> 12:49.268
- YOUR PERFECT WOMAN
IS AT THE BAR,

12:49.351 --> 12:52.062
TEARING UP OVER <i> THE BACHELOR.</i>
NO WEDDING RING.

12:52.146 --> 12:54.190
SHE'S ALREADY HAD
TWO GLASSES OF PINOT.

12:54.273 --> 12:56.859
AH, MAKE THAT THREE.

12:56.942 --> 12:58.986
- OKAY, YOU GOT YOUR LADY,
NOW GIVE US THE SHIRT.

12:59.069 --> 13:02.448
- NOT UNTIL THE DEAL IS SEALED,
BUT HERE'S A PICTURE OF IT

13:02.531 --> 13:07.661
WITH TODAY'S NEWSPAPER,
SO YOU KNOW IT'S STILL ALIVE.

13:07.745 --> 13:10.039
- OKAY,
SHE'S DRUNK, HE'S RICH.

13:10.122 --> 13:13.834
IT COULD WORK.

13:13.918 --> 13:15.419
- MELANIE,
WE PULLED IT OFF.

13:15.503 --> 13:18.881
WE'VE ACTUALLY MADE ARTIE
PALATABLE TO WOMEN.

13:18.964 --> 13:23.719
- [shouting] I'M FIVE FEET AWAY,
AND THANK YOU!

13:27.598 --> 13:30.851
- JACOB!
- EDWARD!

13:30.935 --> 13:34.188
- TUPAC!
- BIGGIE!

13:34.271 --> 13:36.065
- LOOK, I-I DON'T MEAN
TO BUTT IN, BUT YOU TWO

13:36.148 --> 13:38.192
HAVE BEEN FIGHTING ON EITHER
SIDE OF ME FOR OVER AN HOUR.

13:38.275 --> 13:42.905
NOW JOY TOLD ME THAT MY
SITUATION INSPIRED YOUR REUNION.

13:42.988 --> 13:45.032
DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANY WAY
THAT I CAN INSPIRE YOU GUYS

13:45.115 --> 13:47.368
TO BURY THE HATCHET?
LIFE IS SHORT!

13:47.451 --> 13:51.080
- DYING GUY'S
KINDA PREACHY.

13:51.163 --> 13:53.082
- DID YOU SEE
THE CHEAP RING HE GOT HER?

13:53.165 --> 13:56.293
WHAT'S HE SAVING
HIS MONEY FOR?

13:56.377 --> 13:58.254
- WELL,
GLAD I COULD HELP.

13:58.337 --> 14:01.966
PAY IT FORWARD, GUYS.

14:02.049 --> 14:04.134
- THE BRIDE
IS ALMOST READY.

14:04.218 --> 14:05.886
SHE'S NERVOUS,
SO SHE BORROWED SOMETHING BLUE

14:05.970 --> 14:07.137
FROM MY MEDICINE CABINET.

14:07.221 --> 14:09.932
I SUPPOSE I DIDN'T
HAVE TO ANNOUNCE THAT,

14:10.015 --> 14:12.768
BUT I TOOK SOMETHING ORANGE
AND, WELL, I'M A LITTLE CHATTY.

14:12.851 --> 14:15.604
[doorbell rings]

14:18.023 --> 14:20.651
- THE DEAL IS SEALED.
- OH, GREAT, THANKS.

14:20.734 --> 14:22.069
UH, WE'RE ABOUT TO
HAVE A WEDDING,

14:22.152 --> 14:23.779
BUT I'M GLAD THAT THINGS
WENT WELL LAST NIGHT.

14:23.862 --> 14:27.199
- NO, THINGS
DID NOT GO WELL!

14:27.283 --> 14:31.078
YES, I GOT,
AS THE BIBLE SAYS, "LAID,"

14:31.161 --> 14:34.623
BUT ALL THAT COUNTING TO FOUR
BEFORE I SPEAK, IT'S EXHAUSTING.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.625
I WANT A WOMAN
WHO LOVES ME FOR MYSELF!

14:36.709 --> 14:38.502
LIKE YOU, VICTORIA.
- I DO NOT LOVE YOU.

14:38.586 --> 14:42.464
- LIAR!

14:42.548 --> 14:44.550
- HERE COMES THE BRIDE!

14:44.633 --> 14:46.135
- OHH.

14:46.218 --> 14:47.428
- ALL DRESSED IN...

14:47.511 --> 14:49.513
WHITE!

14:49.597 --> 14:53.017
BOLD CHOICE.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.810
- WHERE'S GEORGE?
HE SHOWED UP, DIDN'T HE?

14:54.893 --> 14:59.481
- I'M RIGHT HERE, BABY.
AND YOU LOOK INSANELY BEAUTIFUL.

14:59.565 --> 15:02.234
- AND YOU LOOK
VERY HANDSOME AS WELL.

15:02.318 --> 15:04.653
- SO ARE YOU READY FOR
THREE MONTHS OF WEDDED BLISS?

15:04.737 --> 15:06.697
- ABSOLUTELY.

15:06.780 --> 15:08.324
- HEY, LOOK!
YOU FOUND MY LUCKY SHIRT!

15:08.407 --> 15:11.285
- I DID?

15:11.368 --> 15:13.621
I DID!
SURPRISE!

15:13.704 --> 15:15.956
- WHEN IS THE MINISTER
GONNA GET HERE?

15:16.040 --> 15:17.333
- WHAT TIME
DID YOU TELL HIM TO COME?

15:17.416 --> 15:19.001
- I THOUGHT THE MINISTER
WAS YOUR JOB.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.211
- I THOUGHT IT WAS YOURS.

15:21.295 --> 15:23.922
- PERHAPS I CAN BE
OF SERVICE.

15:24.006 --> 15:27.885
REVEREND ARTIE FIRESTONE,
UNIVERSAL LIFE CHURCH.

15:27.968 --> 15:30.220
I'M ALSO A LICENSED MOHEL,

15:30.304 --> 15:34.016
SHOULD YOU FEEL THE URGE
TO TAKE A LITTLE OFF THE TOP.

15:34.099 --> 15:37.186
- SHOULD WE?
- WHY NOT?

15:37.269 --> 15:41.357
- COME ON, EVERYBODY.
I'M GETTING MARRIED.

15:41.440 --> 15:44.860
- DEARLY BELOVED,
WE ARE GATHERED HERE TODAY

15:44.943 --> 15:48.489
TO JOIN THIS MAN AND WOMAN
IN HOLY MATRIMONY.

15:48.572 --> 15:53.994
DO YOU, REJOYLA SCROGGS--
WHAT A GHASTLY NAME--

15:55.788 --> 15:59.083
TAKE THIS MAN, GEORGE...
- GROSS.

15:59.166 --> 16:02.252
- GEORGE GROSS, TO BE
YOUR LAWFUL WEDDED HUSBAND,

16:02.336 --> 16:06.715
FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE--
[phone rings]

16:06.799 --> 16:09.301
- SORRY,
I MEANT TO TURN THAT OFF.

16:09.385 --> 16:10.719
OH, IT'S MY DOCTOR.
- OH, YOU SHOULD TAKE THAT.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.262
- NO, NO, I COULD ALWAYS--
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

16:12.346 --> 16:15.724
IT COULD BE IMPORTANT.
- HMM, OKAY.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.559
HI, DR. MARCIL.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.603
NO, IT'S OKAY,
I'M JUST GETTING MARRIED.

16:19.687 --> 16:21.689
MM-HMM.
MM-HMM.

16:21.772 --> 16:23.524
REALLY?
ARE YOU SURE?

16:23.607 --> 16:25.275
WOW.

16:25.359 --> 16:28.862
THAT'S--
OH, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

16:28.946 --> 16:30.864
- WHAT?
WHAT IS IT?

16:30.948 --> 16:32.199
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

16:32.282 --> 16:34.410
I JUST GOT
MY NEW BLOOD WORK BACK,

16:34.493 --> 16:38.288
AND INSTEAD OF A FEW MONTHS,
I'VE GOT MORE LIKE TWO YEARS.

16:38.372 --> 16:42.209
- REALLY? THAT'S AMAZING!
- YES!

16:42.292 --> 16:44.920
TWO YEARS! WOW!
- TWO YEARS!

16:45.003 --> 16:48.090
- TWO YEARS.
- TWO YEARS.

16:48.173 --> 16:52.261
- NOT THREE MONTHS.
- NOT THREE MONTHS.

16:52.344 --> 16:54.263
- MAY I CONTINUE?

16:54.346 --> 16:55.597
- BY ALL MEANS.

16:55.681 --> 16:57.599
[clears throat loudly]

16:57.683 --> 16:58.934
- HANG ON.

16:59.017 --> 17:02.104
UH, WE BOTH SAID
THERE WERE A LOT OF THINGS

17:02.187 --> 17:03.439
WE COULD PUT UP WITH
FOR THREE MONTHS,

17:03.522 --> 17:05.773
LIKE THROAT CLEARING,
AND MONKEY CANDLES,

17:05.858 --> 17:08.109
AND UGLY SHIRTS, AND--
- WHAT UGLY SHIRT?

17:08.193 --> 17:10.237
- NEVER MIND.

17:10.319 --> 17:12.990
IT'S JUST THAT NOW
YOU HAVE ALL THIS TIME

17:13.073 --> 17:14.616
TO DO ALL THE THINGS
ON YOUR BUCKET LIST,

17:14.700 --> 17:17.493
AND I DON'T WANT TO
STAND IN YOUR WAY.

17:17.578 --> 17:19.121
BE HONEST WITH ME, GEORGE.

17:19.204 --> 17:23.625
- WELL, I GUESS I STILL
WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A SHOT AT

17:23.709 --> 17:26.587
SLEEPING WITH 300 WOMEN.

17:26.670 --> 17:28.797
- WHAT?
- YOU TOLD ME TO BE HONEST.

17:28.881 --> 17:32.676
- YOU SHOULD'VE
SAID THE FOURTH THING.

17:34.261 --> 17:36.430
- ARE YOU SAYING
TWO YEARS IS TOO LONG

17:36.513 --> 17:38.599
TO HAVE SEX WITH JUST ME?

17:38.682 --> 17:39.475
- WELL, I--

17:39.558 --> 17:42.019
- WHAT IF YOU HAD
SIX MONTHS TO LIVE?

17:42.102 --> 17:43.312
- OH, IT WOULD
STILL BE YOU, BABY.

17:43.395 --> 17:44.313
- NINE MONTHS?

17:44.396 --> 17:48.150
- Y-YOU...

17:48.233 --> 17:49.943
DEFINITELY YOU, YEAH.

17:50.027 --> 17:53.280
BUT COME ON, TWO YEARS?

17:53.363 --> 17:55.616
THAT'S LONGER THAN
ANY RELATIONSHIP I'VE EVER HAD.

17:55.699 --> 17:59.161
- IT IS?
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

17:59.244 --> 18:01.497
WELL, THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU.

18:01.580 --> 18:03.999
- HMM, WHEN JOY AND I
WERE ENGAGED,

18:04.082 --> 18:07.002
WE KNEW EVERYTHING
ABOUT EACH OTHER.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.797
- WAIT A MINUTE,
YOU TWO WERE ENGAGED?

18:09.880 --> 18:10.798
- IT WAS FOR A GREEN CARD,
NOT FOR LOVE.

18:10.881 --> 18:14.802
- LIAR!

18:14.885 --> 18:15.844
- WELL, I GUESS
THERE'S SOME THINGS

18:15.928 --> 18:17.137
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT YOU TOO.

18:17.221 --> 18:19.139
- WE'RE RUSHING
INTO SOMETHING

18:19.223 --> 18:22.184
THAT DOESN'T NEED
RUSHING INTO ANYMORE.

18:22.267 --> 18:24.478
- LOOK, JOY, I DON'T KNOW HOW
ALL THIS IS GOING TO PLAY OUT,

18:24.561 --> 18:27.189
BUT IN A YEAR,
IF YOU'RE STILL AVAILABLE,

18:27.272 --> 18:28.023
DO YOU THINK
MAYBE I COULD--

18:28.106 --> 18:30.484
- COME AND SEE ME AGAIN?

18:30.567 --> 18:34.154
YES, BUT NOT
IN THAT HIDEOUS SHIRT.

18:34.238 --> 18:36.990
- FAIR ENOUGH.
ONE LAST KISS?

18:42.788 --> 18:44.373
[sighs]

18:44.456 --> 18:46.500
- BY THE POWER
VESTED IN ME,

18:46.583 --> 18:50.879
I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU
<i>NOT</i> MAN AND WIFE.

18:50.963 --> 18:55.717
AND AS A LICENSED MOHEL,
I WILL CUT THE CAKE.

18:59.429 --> 19:04.726
- WELL, IT'S OFFICIALLY
MY SECOND FAILED WEDDING,

19:04.810 --> 19:08.397
ONLY THIS TIME I'M TWICE AS OLD.
SO, YOU KNOW...

19:08.480 --> 19:12.234
[mouth full]
IT'S NOT SO SAD.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.196
- WELL, WE'RE OFF
TO THE BALLGAME.

19:16.280 --> 19:18.115
- HAVE FUN.
- GO INDIANS!

19:18.198 --> 19:22.536
- INDIANS? SWEETHEART,
I ROOT FOR THE REDS.

19:22.619 --> 19:24.204
- THAT WAS OUR FIGHT!

19:24.288 --> 19:29.293
1972, YOU DITCHED CLEVELAND
TO ROOT FOR CINCINNATI!

19:29.376 --> 19:31.253
- BECAUSE
THE INDIANS SUCKED

19:31.336 --> 19:33.463
EVER SINCE
THEY TRADED ROCKY COLAVITO!

19:33.547 --> 19:37.259
- GAYLORD PERRY TOOK
THE CY YOUNG THAT YEAR!

19:37.342 --> 19:39.261
- PERRY!
THAT DIRTY PITCHER!

19:39.344 --> 19:41.430
THAT MAN HAD
MORE VASELINE ON HIS BALLS

19:41.513 --> 19:46.351
THAN ELTON JOHN USES
TO SQUEEZE INTO HIS SHOW PANTS.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.563
- COME ON, WE'RE GONNA
MISS THE FIRST PITCH.

19:49.646 --> 19:51.940
- WELL,
AGE BEFORE BEAUTY.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.817
I'M TWO MINUTES YOUNGER,
YOU KNOW?

19:53.901 --> 19:56.820
- THE HAPPIEST TWO MINUTES
OF MOM'S LIFE.

19:56.904 --> 19:59.114
- I SHOULD'VE STRANGLED YOU
WHILE WE WERE STILL IN THE WOMB

19:59.197 --> 20:02.034
AND I HAD THE CHANCE.

20:02.117 --> 20:03.785
BY THE WAY,
YOU ARE BUYING THE HOT DOGS.

20:03.869 --> 20:06.121
- OH,
SPEAKING OF HOT DOGS,

20:06.204 --> 20:09.791
YOUR HEAD IS PULLED TIGHTER
THAN A BALLPARK FRANK.

20:09.875 --> 20:12.794
AND FULL OF
JUST AS MUCH CRAP.

20:12.878 --> 20:15.547
- YOU STILL LIKE MUSTARD?

20:15.631 --> 20:16.632
[door closes]
