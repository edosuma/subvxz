WEBVTT

00:00.434 --> 00:02.234
- Uh-oh.

00:02.303 --> 00:06.238
- Davison and mcconnell
filed an official complaint
against you this morning.

00:06.307 --> 00:08.940
I'm sending you on secondment
while we look into this.

00:09.010 --> 00:10.776
- Remember when we felt love
like that?

00:10.845 --> 00:13.312
- Yeah.
Thank god we numbed with age.

00:13.314 --> 00:16.748
- I love when older women
explore their sexualities.
- Older is right!

00:16.784 --> 00:19.984
You should see this kid
she's shtupping!
It's ridiculous!

00:20.021 --> 00:21.553
- I miss you.
- Angie--

00:21.688 --> 00:23.422
- Can we just go for dinner
this week, maybe?

00:23.424 --> 00:25.057
<i> - I saw naz at the hospital</i>
<i> with his ex.</i>

00:25.059 --> 00:27.926
<i> They were hugging closely.</i>
He lied about it.

00:27.995 --> 00:30.996
- Alright, if we're gonna
find out why will paid dane
to set off a shot-tipper,

00:31.131 --> 00:32.731
<i> We need to get closer to him.</i>

00:32.866 --> 00:35.400
- It's not a party,
it's a business meeting.
- That's your wife?

00:35.436 --> 00:37.602
- I'm his sister. Adeline.

00:37.671 --> 00:40.805
- Police! Identify yourself!
<i> Adeline's booze cans.</i>

00:40.841 --> 00:43.274
- Balda.
- Will, who's balda?

00:44.812 --> 00:47.245
- Right now, you're stomping
all over a homicide
or suicide scene.

00:47.314 --> 00:49.648
I need you both to tiptoe
your asses outta here.

00:55.022 --> 00:57.089
Now I need you both to tiptoe
your asses outta here.

00:57.224 --> 00:58.657
(chuckling)
- good luck.

01:06.634 --> 01:08.433
- These two.
- I'll handle it.

01:08.436 --> 01:10.602
(sighing)
- hey.

01:11.739 --> 01:14.573
Yeah, I'm detec--
- samantha wazowski, I know.

01:14.575 --> 01:18.443
And right now you're stomping
all over a homicide
or suicide scene

01:18.512 --> 01:20.245
In your excellent sneakers.

01:20.380 --> 01:22.714
I'm gonna have to ask you
and your partner kelly duff
to skedaddle.

01:22.850 --> 01:24.383
- We should give you
a statement.

01:24.518 --> 01:27.085
- Zip it. We approach
every scene with an open mind.

01:27.121 --> 01:29.188
We can't have amateur theories
muddying the water.

01:29.190 --> 01:31.790
- I need you two to tiptoe
your asses out of here.

01:31.792 --> 01:33.325
- Good luck.

01:33.394 --> 01:34.893
(scoffing)

01:37.198 --> 01:39.931
- That's more of a<i> pas de barré,</i>
but okay.

01:39.967 --> 01:43.868
- What a pair of idiots.
Hey! Where's the stiff?

01:46.207 --> 01:48.406
- Will french,
park-bench realtor.

01:49.910 --> 01:52.811
(sighing)
looks like this guy shot up
enough dope to kill a horse.

01:52.880 --> 01:57.048
- Maybe,
but french isn't an addict.
Look at his arms. No tracks.

01:58.919 --> 02:01.352
- That's why it killed him,
I guess. He was a tourist trying
to play in the big leagues.

02:01.388 --> 02:04.022
- What's going on?
- You can't come in here, ma'am.
- Where's my brother?!

02:04.024 --> 02:06.158
Oh, my god. Will!

02:06.227 --> 02:08.560
- Ms. French,
I'm detective tara swallows.

02:09.396 --> 02:11.463
- Like the bird?

02:11.532 --> 02:13.765
I love birds.

02:13.901 --> 02:15.767
- I do, too.
- I'm adeline.

02:18.873 --> 02:21.306
- Oh! Adeline...
- Will, wake up.

02:21.441 --> 02:23.876
- Contamination of the crime
scene, of the evidence.
Do we care?

02:24.011 --> 02:27.312
- We'll take it outside.
Adeline, come with me.
Right now, come on.

02:27.447 --> 02:30.182
- Wake up, wake up.
- He's dead.

02:32.419 --> 02:34.520
(adeline crying)

02:34.655 --> 02:36.454
Have a seat.
(adeline sighing)

02:40.294 --> 02:42.594
Adeline, did your brother have
a drug problem?

02:42.630 --> 02:46.398
- He used to,
but I-I... I thought he quit.

02:46.533 --> 02:49.501
I was with him a few hours ago,
but he seemed upset,

02:49.503 --> 02:51.803
And then I went
to my... My burlesque class,

02:51.805 --> 02:55.740
And I just had a bad feeling,
so I came to check on him here.

02:55.809 --> 02:58.544
He od'd. Didn't he?
Please tell me.

02:58.679 --> 03:02.314
- We're not sure.
We'd like to bring you in,
have you answer a few questions.

03:04.151 --> 03:06.384
- Actually, hold on.
Just a sec.

03:10.824 --> 03:14.426
What's your problem, hounding
this poor, gorgeous woman?
She's in shock.

03:14.495 --> 03:16.361
- Maybe she knows more
than she's saying.

03:16.430 --> 03:19.565
- Ugh, don't be ridiculous.
This woman needs a moment.
She's grieving.

03:22.603 --> 03:24.369
(adeline crying)

03:26.640 --> 03:30.242
- Is he fully dead?
- A hundred percent, fully.
I'm so sorry.

03:30.244 --> 03:33.077
♪ I'm lost in emotion ♪

03:34.314 --> 03:36.448
♪ telling you things
you really shouldn't know ♪

03:36.517 --> 03:41.019
♪ oh baby
I'm lost in emotion ♪

03:44.425 --> 03:45.991
- Morning, mom.
- Mm-hmm.

03:46.060 --> 03:48.927
♪ oh I'm lost in emotion ♪

03:50.331 --> 03:53.331
- Whatcha reading?
- The haunting
of chauncey dubois.

03:53.400 --> 03:56.134
- Ooh! Is the haunting
supposed to be sexy?

03:56.170 --> 03:59.972
- Yeah, I know it looks like
a bodice-ripping good time,
but it's a total bore.

04:00.107 --> 04:03.208
One of the morons
in my book club suggested it.

04:04.478 --> 04:06.311
- Your book club? Since when
do you have a book club?

04:06.447 --> 04:10.282
- Since you told me to get
a life. I joined
neighbourhoodmeetup.Com.

04:10.284 --> 04:12.417
First meeting's, uh...
Day after tomorrow.

04:12.552 --> 04:14.653
Would you care to join?
I'm hosting.

04:14.655 --> 04:17.822
- Mom, you're inviting a bunch
of strangers into my house? Oh.

04:17.858 --> 04:20.158
- Sam,
they're all your neighbours!

04:20.294 --> 04:22.160
You don't have any riff-raff
in your neighbourhood.

04:22.229 --> 04:25.229
- You know what? I doubt
I'll be able to make it.
I'm in the middle of a case.

04:25.266 --> 04:26.965
- Oh.
- Two weeks ago,

04:27.100 --> 04:28.700
Someone killed a drug-dealing
real-estate agent.

04:28.702 --> 04:30.435
They made it look
like an overdose.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.871
- Sounds like the plot
of a chauncey novel
without the ghosts.

04:32.873 --> 04:35.039
- Mm.
- You really should take
your own advice,

04:35.075 --> 04:38.443
Forge new friendships,
new relationships
before it's too late.

04:38.479 --> 04:40.845
Wh-wh-what's the update
on this naz fellow?

04:42.182 --> 04:43.515
- Uh...

04:45.252 --> 04:46.651
Uh, just...

04:48.188 --> 04:51.056
He's just been, like,
hanging out with his ex a lot
lately, so...

04:51.125 --> 04:53.358
- Really? By themselves?

04:54.995 --> 04:58.597
- Um, no. I don't know, I...

04:58.599 --> 05:01.799
I just, like, overheard them
planning a trip to stratford
together.

05:02.869 --> 05:05.236
And, like,
I didn't say anything. 'cause...

05:07.174 --> 05:09.674
Like, I just didn't want
to be that person.

05:09.677 --> 05:11.610
Mom, do...
Do you think that's weird?

05:11.745 --> 05:14.479
- I hang out with your ex
all the time.
You think that's weird?

05:14.515 --> 05:18.550
- Absolutely! I think
that is absolutely so weird.

05:18.619 --> 05:21.286
- I'm sorry, but steve
is a good, good man.

05:21.421 --> 05:24.122
I still think you cut him loose
far too early.

05:24.158 --> 05:26.024
- Okay. Mom, you know what?

05:26.093 --> 05:30.629
I want you to invite
as many people as you want
to the book club, hmm?

05:30.764 --> 05:33.098
So you can make many,
many new friends.

05:34.768 --> 05:36.434
Not just my ex.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.102
(sighing)

05:39.406 --> 05:41.739
- Adriana, you're picking up
the gender-reveal fireworks

05:41.775 --> 05:43.308
And the gender-reveal cake,
right?

05:43.443 --> 05:44.976
- Mm-hmm.
- Do we need fireworks
and a cake?

05:45.045 --> 05:47.779
I thought karina was the only
one doing the gender reveal.

05:47.815 --> 05:50.449
- She is.
I don't care about gender. Plus,
you know I love a surprise.

05:50.451 --> 05:54.018
- We went over all this
last time, kel.
Oh, did you order the balloons?

05:55.089 --> 05:56.421
- Yeah.

05:57.558 --> 05:59.191
- Well, consider this
your 50th reminder.

05:59.193 --> 06:01.526
Jesus, kelly,
the shower's tomorrow.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.862
Now, I have to pee.

06:03.864 --> 06:06.330
Again.
(whimpering)

06:09.269 --> 06:13.905
- Yo. Ain't she supposed to be
nesting and getting all sweet
and motherly?

06:14.040 --> 06:16.774
- Didn't you guys make up?
(sighing)

06:17.478 --> 06:19.144
What's going on with you?

06:19.146 --> 06:20.745
(sighing)

06:22.015 --> 06:24.282
- I ended things with len.

06:24.284 --> 06:26.618
- Oh, kel. I'm sorry.

06:26.620 --> 06:31.490
- You know, I'm just not in
the mood to celebrate people's
perfect lives, perfect babies.

06:35.062 --> 06:37.896
- Just because
it's not your time now
doesn't mean it won't ever be.

06:39.967 --> 06:41.799
(phone buzzing, chiming)

06:43.704 --> 06:46.571
- Oh, I gotta go.
See you tomorrow.

06:47.974 --> 06:49.574
(kissing)
love you.

06:50.778 --> 06:53.344
(karina): Kelly,
remember the balloons!
- Yeah.

06:54.415 --> 06:57.382
- So the last time
we saw this wild woman,

06:57.517 --> 06:59.450
She locked us in a cellar
"accidentally,"

06:59.486 --> 07:02.186
And then she took off with
her brother, whom she hated,

07:02.222 --> 07:04.990
Who also died
of a heroin overdose
a few short hours later.

07:04.992 --> 07:08.126
- While she scurried off
to a burlesque class?
(scoffing)

07:08.195 --> 07:11.530
I mean, I can't believe
homicide actually bought
that ridiculous alibi.

07:11.532 --> 07:14.866
- They did follow up,
and her burlesque teacher
did confirm her attendance.

07:15.001 --> 07:19.270
- Oh, please.
(sam): Either way, will's last
words were "balda did this."

07:19.306 --> 07:22.607
And the only person who might
know who balda is, is adeline.

07:22.676 --> 07:24.742
And now we can't even ask her
about it, because apparently,

07:24.778 --> 07:27.746
Adeline is on a grief retreat
in the laurentians,
off the grid and unreachable.

07:27.881 --> 07:30.115
Okay! Balda, who is that?

07:30.117 --> 07:32.150
- Or what is that?
I looked it up.

07:32.219 --> 07:36.421
It's either a vintage camera
or a toy store in belgium.

07:36.556 --> 07:39.390
But the guy was dying.
It could've been gibberish.

07:39.426 --> 07:41.492
- Why do you think adeline
would know about balda?

07:41.528 --> 07:43.762
- Look, the woman is smarter
than anyone gives her
credit for.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.830
- Yeah, maybe,
but she doesn't pay for parking.

07:45.899 --> 07:49.300
She's racked up thousands
of dollars in parking tickets
all over the city,

07:49.336 --> 07:51.636
Including half a dozen
on westveld street.

07:51.771 --> 07:53.238
- Okay.

07:53.373 --> 07:56.507
- Okay, well, her rental car
got another one there yesterday.

07:56.543 --> 07:59.911
- Yesterday?
- Grief retreat, my ass.

08:01.982 --> 08:04.181
(sighing)
so what's around here

08:04.218 --> 08:06.584
That adeline french
can't stay away from?

08:07.788 --> 08:11.122
- Bye-bye! Oh, and olga,
take it easy on the palinka.

08:13.594 --> 08:16.528
You two!
I've been expecting you.

08:16.597 --> 08:18.362
You've come for a reading,
correct?

08:18.398 --> 08:20.865
- Maybe some other time?
- Do you have time to waste?

08:20.934 --> 08:22.800
Zorka.

08:22.870 --> 08:25.470
Seventh-generation psychic.

08:25.605 --> 08:27.872
When you're ready to see
your future,

08:27.941 --> 08:29.574
<i> Entrez.</i>

08:30.244 --> 08:32.344
(chuckling)
- hey.

08:32.346 --> 08:34.745
Maybe she's seen something,
maybe we should go in.

08:34.781 --> 08:37.248
- What, with her third eye?
- Of course not,

08:37.251 --> 08:40.752
But if she solicits
random people on the street,
maybe she's seen adeline.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.421
Come on.

08:52.232 --> 08:53.899
- Been in the neighbourhood
long?

08:54.034 --> 08:55.766
- Thirty years.
- Oh, that's exciting.

08:55.802 --> 08:58.903
I'm wondering if you've seen--
- I ask the questions first.

08:58.939 --> 09:01.505
Get a feel for you both, hmm?

09:03.176 --> 09:08.579
Mm-hmm.
You are close like sisters.
Best friends?

09:08.615 --> 09:10.649
- Are you... You could just tell
that by looking at us?

09:10.784 --> 09:14.585
- Who would like
the first reading?
- I will, I'll go, I'll do it.

09:14.621 --> 09:16.854
- Uh-huh.

09:16.924 --> 09:20.759
Uh-huh, your romantic life,
there's something wrong.

09:20.761 --> 09:24.396
You have left behind
a great love.

09:24.531 --> 09:26.898
- Ooh, heartbreaker wazowski,
huh?

09:27.033 --> 09:28.733
- Unlike you.

09:28.735 --> 09:32.337
You are too careful
with your heart, your feelings.

09:32.406 --> 09:38.109
Which is why you have also lost
a relationship
with deep connections.

09:38.178 --> 09:41.012
- Uh, yeah.
Uh, can I use your bathroom?

09:41.081 --> 09:42.713
- Second door on the left.

09:46.186 --> 09:50.521
She's lucky.
Some losses are irreplaceable.

09:52.025 --> 09:53.858
(crying)

09:55.028 --> 09:57.128
I-I'm sorry, I, uh...

09:57.197 --> 10:00.432
I lost my son, ilya.

10:00.567 --> 10:04.035
- Oh, god. Was it recent?
I'm so sorry. What happened?

10:04.170 --> 10:08.840
- My daughter,
the human tornado.
That's what happened.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.575
She's a bad seed.

10:10.710 --> 10:13.645
If he got into drugs,
it was because of her.

10:13.647 --> 10:16.581
My daughter balda,
she's a handful.

10:18.085 --> 10:22.253
Partying, shopping, women, men,
bed to bed.

10:22.255 --> 10:26.390
Ilya, he was managing her money.
Otherwise, she'd go broke.

10:28.194 --> 10:29.994
But now ilya's gone.

10:30.063 --> 10:31.663
<i> (nathan):</i>
<i> So zorka's their mother?</i>

10:31.732 --> 10:34.265
- Yep,
but adeline is balda farkas,
sister to will,

10:34.267 --> 10:37.202
Aka ilya farkas,
and possibly responsible
for his death.

10:37.337 --> 10:38.937
- Where did you find
this picture?

10:39.072 --> 10:41.806
- A simple toggle image search
of ilya and balda farkas

10:41.941 --> 10:44.342
Brought me to the greater
toronto hungarian community
centre website.

10:44.411 --> 10:48.279
And in 2015, the farkas siblings
cut themselves off from
their hungarian mobster father

10:48.315 --> 10:49.881
And their psychic mother.

10:50.016 --> 10:53.584
- And transformed themselves
into will and adeline french,

10:53.654 --> 10:56.087
Now both dead centre
of this coyote alliance.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.822
- Check this out.

10:57.957 --> 11:01.559
<i>- Do you suffer from bad karma?</i>
<i> Are you the victim of a curse?</i>

11:01.628 --> 11:04.562
<i> Love life getting you down?</i>

11:04.631 --> 11:07.631
<i> I am zorka,</i>
<i> seventh-generation psychic!</i>

11:09.035 --> 11:11.503
<i> - After years of pain,</i>
<i> zorka told me I'd been cursed,</i>

11:11.638 --> 11:14.338
<i> So I drank her magic hungarian</i>
<i> spring water.</i>

11:14.374 --> 11:17.575
<i> Now, I've never felt better</i>
<i> in my whole life!</i>

11:18.445 --> 11:21.112
<i> - Call 1-555-zrka.</i>

11:21.247 --> 11:25.183
<i>Just 10 easy payments of 99.99.</i>

11:25.252 --> 11:29.721
- So mom's a fraudster.
Magic water.
One step up from snake oil.

11:29.856 --> 11:31.856
- Yep. Zorka has a bunch
of one-star reviews.

11:31.925 --> 11:34.592
Customers say she sold them
tap water for thousands.

11:34.594 --> 11:36.794
- She was arrested for it last
year, but charges were dropped.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.863
But she is definitely
still running this scam.

11:38.998 --> 11:42.267
- So all we have to do
is catch her selling
this phony miracle water,

11:42.402 --> 11:44.803
Threaten to charge her
with fraud unless she gives us
adeline,

11:44.805 --> 11:47.205
Then once we have adeline,
we're gonna flip her over
to frowny mc-smelled-a-fart

11:47.340 --> 11:49.808
And human marionette to
reconsider the homicide charge.

11:51.177 --> 11:53.077
- This is all very interesting,
but last time I checked,

11:53.113 --> 11:54.679
You don't work homicide
or fraud,

11:54.814 --> 11:56.814
And I'm not hearing anything
about pink cocaine.

11:56.850 --> 12:00.885
Nazeer, greene, and I
are gonna take
a more logical approach.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.520
Let's go, boys.

12:03.724 --> 12:05.556
(grunting)

12:08.428 --> 12:11.029
- Okay. So who is gonna
go in with zorka?

12:11.031 --> 12:15.466
She seems to only target
the gullible, the desperate
and the over-fifties.

12:16.837 --> 12:18.469
- We might know someone.

12:21.675 --> 12:23.574
- You want my help
because I'm old?

12:23.643 --> 12:27.178
If you think I'm gonna put on
hard pants for this,
you are sorely mistaken.

12:27.313 --> 12:29.948
- We do not think
that you're old.
It has nothing to do with age,

12:29.950 --> 12:32.082
It's just more
like general malaise.

12:32.119 --> 12:36.353
- We are asking because you have
the most experience.
We need you, ed.

12:38.925 --> 12:41.192
- Just for today, off the books.

12:42.696 --> 12:44.796
- You know, kevin is sick,
I can't leave him.

12:44.931 --> 12:47.331
- Okay. Sure. Um...

12:47.400 --> 12:49.667
(baby talk)

12:49.669 --> 12:53.337
I guess that means
you will not be needing
your hard pants anymore.

12:53.339 --> 12:55.106
Just curious, what size are you?

12:55.108 --> 12:59.877
- Oh, no, that's the wrong
colour for you, wazowski.
But on me,

12:59.946 --> 13:01.546
It look damn nice.

13:01.548 --> 13:04.148
- Get your hands off my blazer.

13:05.151 --> 13:06.750
Vultures.

13:08.288 --> 13:11.790
I'm not done yet. Mm-mm.

13:17.363 --> 13:19.430
I think my partner's cheating
on me.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.499
My ex-partner also cheated.

13:22.836 --> 13:25.369
You know what?
I think I just attract them,
cheaters.

13:25.405 --> 13:27.838
Why would that be?
Maybe I'm cursed.

13:29.075 --> 13:31.709
I heard that you specialize
in this sort of thing.

13:31.778 --> 13:34.445
- What sort of thing?
<i> (shanks): Bad luck.</i>

13:34.447 --> 13:37.181
<i> (zorka): Maybe.</i>
<i> But that's not your problem.</i>

13:37.250 --> 13:39.383
- Why isn't zorka taking
the bait?

13:39.419 --> 13:43.187
- I don't know. Maybe her recent
arrest made her jumpy?
- Yeah, but that was a year ago.

13:43.256 --> 13:45.657
- What do you think
my problem is?

13:45.659 --> 13:50.127
- You're lying.
The cheating's not real,
it's not why you're here.

13:51.464 --> 13:53.931
It's your son, isn't it?
He's sick.

13:55.268 --> 13:57.268
- Is she talking about kevin?
How's she know about kevin?

13:57.304 --> 13:59.070
- Zorka's not a psychic.

13:59.205 --> 14:02.407
- Kevin is ill.
How did you know?

14:02.409 --> 14:04.609
- Because I'm a psychic.
<i> - What if she's right?</i>

14:04.611 --> 14:08.345
- Kevin is a dog,
not shanks's son!
- Well, don't tell shanks that.

14:08.381 --> 14:11.482
Besides, I'm talking about me.
Am I leaving a great love behind
with naz?

14:11.618 --> 14:14.219
Because I have been feeling
pretty detached from him lately.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.153
- You've got unresolved
trust issues.

14:16.155 --> 14:19.290
It's... No surprise,
considering your ex
cheated on you.

14:19.326 --> 14:22.559
- You clearly have no respect
for my abilities.

14:22.596 --> 14:24.562
Why did you even come here?

14:27.334 --> 14:29.167
- I'm lost.

14:29.169 --> 14:34.372
I gave my entire life
to my career,
and I make one mistake,

14:34.441 --> 14:39.443
<i> And now I'm awaiting</i>
<i> disciplinary action while</i>
<i> someone else sits at my desk.</i>

14:39.479 --> 14:41.245
<i> And what's almost worse</i>

14:41.281 --> 14:45.383
Is that I thought I was close
to my coworkers,
like, really close.

14:45.452 --> 14:47.051
I thought I was a mentor.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.387
<i>Since I left, I barely see them.</i>

14:49.456 --> 14:52.990
<i> People at work,</i>
<i> especially the women,</i>
<i> they're like my family,</i>

14:53.026 --> 14:57.662
And I miss them,
and I'm not sure I know who I am
without them.

14:58.198 --> 14:59.530
- Hey.

15:01.201 --> 15:03.401
The fried pigeon...

15:03.536 --> 15:05.670
Will not just fly
into your mouth.

15:07.207 --> 15:09.006
- Uh, come again?

15:09.042 --> 15:11.943
- You want change,
you work for it.

15:12.078 --> 15:14.345
Get out of bed,
put on your clothes,

15:14.347 --> 15:16.214
Answer those phone calls,
stop moping!

15:16.349 --> 15:19.550
Luckily for you, I can help.
But first,

15:19.552 --> 15:21.118
At your work,

15:21.187 --> 15:25.122
You're replaced
by an inferior man,
am I right?

15:26.626 --> 15:30.762
- So pink cocaine has recently
been purchased here,
here and here.

15:30.897 --> 15:33.398
- So distribution didn't die
with will french.

15:33.533 --> 15:36.500
- No, but if we comb
through these hotspots,

15:36.536 --> 15:40.237
Perhaps we can figure out
who the new local supplier is.

15:40.239 --> 15:43.507
- How?
- Well...
I have created an algorithm

15:43.543 --> 15:45.843
That uses pre-existing
drug-arrest stats

15:45.879 --> 15:48.713
To show average physical
proximity down to the kilometre

15:48.715 --> 15:50.648
Between dealers
and their local suppliers.

15:50.717 --> 15:54.719
- Isn't that basically
geographic profiling?
Used to find serial killers?

15:54.788 --> 15:57.188
- Yes, but it's never been used
to find drug suppliers before,

15:57.257 --> 15:59.857
And apprehend them
before they get more product
onto the streets.

15:59.893 --> 16:02.593
- Kind of like minority report,
but for drugs.

16:02.729 --> 16:04.529
- I'm not sure
what you're saying,

16:04.664 --> 16:07.331
I'm just saying I want
to anticipate crime and stop it
before it happens.

16:09.869 --> 16:14.272
- Right. But...
Don't we think the stats
can be a little biased?

16:14.274 --> 16:16.741
- It's called intelligence-led
policing, greene.

16:16.743 --> 16:18.709
That's what we're doing today,
okay?

16:18.778 --> 16:21.812
So pull the data on any dealer
from these areas,

16:21.848 --> 16:24.148
Input it,
let the computer do the rest.

16:24.283 --> 16:27.451
(knocking)
excuse me.

16:32.425 --> 16:34.191
(humming)

16:34.861 --> 16:36.694
(inhaling and gasping)

16:36.829 --> 16:38.496
- It's as I suspected.

16:39.499 --> 16:42.699
Both you and your son...
Are cursed.

16:42.736 --> 16:45.302
<i> But I have just the thing</i>
<i> to help.</i>

16:45.338 --> 16:49.373
Magic spring water
from egerszalók, hungary.

16:50.343 --> 16:51.876
$1,200 a bottle,

16:52.011 --> 16:55.179
<i> But it can heal many ailments.</i>

16:56.516 --> 16:58.582
- Do you take cash?
<i> - Mm-hmm.</i>

17:00.620 --> 17:03.120
- Here you go. $2,400.
- Hmm.

17:03.189 --> 17:05.489
- Okay! Go, go, go, go!

17:11.498 --> 17:14.732
(shanks): Hey! Hang on a sec!
I was just starting to believe!

17:14.734 --> 17:17.001
- Where is she?! Go, go!

17:21.674 --> 17:24.942
- No, you don't!
Police! You're under arrest!

17:24.978 --> 17:28.412
- You're under arrest!
- Sam! Forget that!

17:33.453 --> 17:35.753
(panting)

17:36.956 --> 17:39.157
- Hey, stop!

17:39.159 --> 17:40.758
Get back here!

17:41.694 --> 17:43.828
(tires screeching)
(screaming)

17:43.897 --> 17:46.763
(exclaiming)
zorka farkas,

17:46.800 --> 17:51.034
You... Are impressively fast,
and under arrest.

17:51.071 --> 17:54.639
- How did you know
where I was going?
Do you also have the gift?

17:54.774 --> 17:57.174
- Nah. I'm just really good
at my job.

18:03.716 --> 18:06.050
Ammonia, phosphoric acid. Hmm.

18:06.119 --> 18:08.519
Sound like magic hungarian water
to you, wazowski?

18:08.588 --> 18:10.855
- It really does not. It sounds
like the exact composition

18:10.924 --> 18:12.923
Of good old-fashioned
toronto tap water.

18:12.959 --> 18:15.726
I am guessing that zorka's water
is a scam.

18:15.728 --> 18:18.930
- You can't prove
it doesn't work.
Magic is tricky like that.

18:19.065 --> 18:21.398
- Magic or not,
you misrepresented your product,

18:21.468 --> 18:23.868
Which means you'll be charged
with fraud.

18:24.003 --> 18:25.536
- I am not a fraud.
- Mm.

18:26.473 --> 18:28.071
- Wait.

18:29.109 --> 18:31.275
This isn't really about me,
is it?

18:31.277 --> 18:34.444
- We want to talk to you
about balda.
- Why?

18:35.882 --> 18:37.615
- Because we think
she killed your son.

18:47.127 --> 18:50.627
- Where's your daughter now?
- We need to find her,
and if not her,

18:50.663 --> 18:53.431
Then at least give us something
we can use to bring her in.

18:53.433 --> 18:56.833
- I don't know where she is.
I... I...

18:59.506 --> 19:03.174
But... Maybe I have something.

19:03.309 --> 19:05.109
My husband, vencel,

19:05.244 --> 19:07.111
Peace to his ashes,

19:07.246 --> 19:08.779
Taught balda:

19:10.049 --> 19:13.651
Get dirt on your enemies
and then you're untouchable.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.653
She gave me a usb.

19:17.157 --> 19:18.723
If anything happened to her,

19:18.858 --> 19:21.525
I was supposed to give it
to her accountant,

19:21.594 --> 19:23.594
An adam something,

19:23.596 --> 19:25.997
To expose those that hurt her.

19:26.132 --> 19:30.100
Now that she's hurt me, maybe...
I should give it to you?

19:31.737 --> 19:34.138
If my charges are dropped.

19:37.277 --> 19:39.876
Well, unless you have
a better option.

19:42.916 --> 19:46.751
- Gentlemen, meet lucky spacek,

19:46.886 --> 19:49.553
Our new potential supplier.

19:52.625 --> 19:55.492
He lives within five kilometres
of four dealers

19:55.528 --> 19:57.361
Who were arrested
for pink-cocaine sales,

19:57.430 --> 20:01.298
And he's got an association with
coyote member bingo ramirez,

20:01.434 --> 20:05.570
Whom I believe you connected...
To will french.

20:05.705 --> 20:10.074
We should get a team
over to his place asap,
start surveilling him.

20:10.076 --> 20:13.144
- You want to watch him
because he lives near someone
who committed a crime?

20:13.279 --> 20:16.180
- Context, greene.
Plus, the numbers don't lie.

20:16.182 --> 20:18.182
We should name this thing,
this algorithm.

20:18.184 --> 20:20.584
Something spiffy.
How about crack whacker?

20:22.055 --> 20:24.154
Okay, dope dotter?

20:24.190 --> 20:26.057
- Dope daughter, like a kid?

20:26.192 --> 20:29.727
- No, d-o-t-t...
Do you want me...
Should I write it?

20:29.862 --> 20:34.331
- No, no, we get it.
It's, um...
Well, it's certainly creative.

20:34.467 --> 20:37.868
- That's why they gave me
the promotions. Happy to share
my strategy with you:

20:37.870 --> 20:39.903
Doing the job you want to get.

20:41.474 --> 20:44.008
People don't always see
my point. For example,

20:44.077 --> 20:45.810
I tried to give gabrielle
some advice,

20:45.945 --> 20:48.813
You know,
coach her on next steps
after her sergeant promotion.

20:48.948 --> 20:51.782
Told her to freeze her eggs,
give her some more time
to climb.

20:51.818 --> 20:53.851
I mean, why settle
for a low-status position?

20:53.986 --> 20:57.087
- Yeah. Starting to see
why you two broke up.

20:57.156 --> 21:01.992
- Really? What I want to know
is why did you two break up?

21:03.696 --> 21:06.464
- Hey, nathan.
Could I get your help?

21:06.599 --> 21:09.566
- Sure.
Had enough stats for today.

21:14.941 --> 21:18.709
(beeping)
it looks like they used bitcrypt
to encrypt adeline's usb.

21:18.844 --> 21:20.777
It's impossible to hack.

21:20.813 --> 21:23.780
Our best shot is to get
decryption software
from the company...

21:23.816 --> 21:25.983
(sighing)
...Which is based in nyc.

21:26.118 --> 21:28.853
- So we'd have to go
to the rcmp.

21:28.988 --> 21:33.924
- Well, uh, we could avoid that
if one of us had a connection
to a u.S. Law-enforcement agent.

21:33.993 --> 21:36.327
You know,
like a long-standing friendship,

21:36.462 --> 21:40.297
Or maybe even a family tie
who's having some sort
of an event today?

21:40.300 --> 21:41.798
- I get it.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.969
('50s music playing)

21:48.874 --> 21:51.341
(background chatter)

21:53.646 --> 21:56.480
- This is... Ni-nice.

21:56.482 --> 22:00.818
- Yeah. Looks like someone ate
too much pinterest
and threw up everywhere.

22:00.887 --> 22:03.487
- Hey, we need her help,
so please, you have to be nice.
- Alright.

22:03.523 --> 22:05.021
- Okay.

22:08.027 --> 22:09.627
- Hey...

22:09.762 --> 22:11.495
- Congratulations, karina.

22:11.564 --> 22:13.497
- Kelly. I didn't think
you'd make it.

22:13.499 --> 22:15.699
- You kidding me?
I wouldn't miss this
for the world.

22:17.169 --> 22:19.503
I know it sounds cliché,
but you actually are glowing
right now.

22:19.505 --> 22:22.907
- You certainly are.
You're glowing like
a big lightbulb, you are.

22:23.042 --> 22:26.643
Okay, this is... I'm gonna...
Good to see you. Drinks.

22:29.215 --> 22:32.315
- Anyway... Great turnout.

22:33.453 --> 22:36.253
Did, uh, elijah make it?
Pretty sure we asked him.

22:36.389 --> 22:41.525
- Elijah who? Elijah fox?
Fbi elijah? Why would you invite
my ex-boyfriend to my shower?

22:41.527 --> 22:43.928
- I don't know. He's a nice guy.

22:45.798 --> 22:48.065
(sighing)
alright, look.

22:48.134 --> 22:50.401
Sam and I are in a bit
of a bind,

22:50.403 --> 22:53.471
And we need the fbi to pressure
bitcrypt to share some
of their decryption software.

22:53.606 --> 22:55.873
We don't have time to deal
with the rcmp.

22:55.875 --> 22:58.609
It's a huge, huge part
of our case.

22:58.678 --> 23:00.945
Karina,
I would really appreciate it.

23:00.947 --> 23:03.747
- Oh, you would? Well, you want
to know what I'd appreciate?

23:03.783 --> 23:07.651
If you acted like a sister
and maybe participated
in our shower.

23:07.653 --> 23:09.620
- Okay, well,
when's the gender reveal?

23:09.689 --> 23:11.288
- It's in five hours.

23:11.290 --> 23:13.124
(awkward laughter)

23:13.259 --> 23:14.891
- Ah...
- Five hours.

23:14.927 --> 23:16.760
- That's... That's good.

23:16.763 --> 23:19.529
- What kind of maniac
has a six-hour baby shower?!

23:22.168 --> 23:23.900
Please tell me this is alcohol.

23:25.371 --> 23:27.704
- I think she's...
(indistinct chatter)

23:29.108 --> 23:30.974
- Why is karina being so hard
on you?

23:31.043 --> 23:33.377
You just went through
a really bad breakup.

23:33.379 --> 23:36.780
- She doesn't know that.
- What, you didn't tell her?
- She doesn't care.

23:36.783 --> 23:40.250
She certainly doesn't want
to hear about it
on her special day.

23:40.286 --> 23:42.186
(sighing)
- you know what?

23:43.856 --> 23:47.458
If it's karina's special day...
She better get ready
to work for it.

23:47.527 --> 23:50.127
- What?
- Let's kick her ass.
Alright, ladies!

23:50.262 --> 23:52.663
- What--
- who wants to play a game?!
- Sam, no, don't!

23:52.732 --> 23:54.064
(cheering)
- yes!

23:55.868 --> 23:58.735
- Baby, are you ready for this?
- Mm-hmm.

23:58.737 --> 24:01.939
(cheering)
is everybody ready for this?
(all): Yes!

24:01.941 --> 24:05.141
- Hey. We're going to lose.
- No, no, we just have to align
our asses.

24:05.178 --> 24:07.945
- No! No.
I mean we have to lose.

24:08.014 --> 24:09.646
Look, look!

24:10.817 --> 24:13.617
(woman): Ready? Alright.
- Okay?

24:13.619 --> 24:15.352
- On your mark,

24:15.421 --> 24:17.888
Get set... Go!

24:18.824 --> 24:21.091
(cheering)
(excited shouting)

24:32.738 --> 24:34.171
- Whoo-hoo!

24:34.306 --> 24:35.773
- Yeah!!!

24:35.775 --> 24:37.307
- Ugh.

24:39.111 --> 24:41.044
The cake tastes like envelopes.

24:41.080 --> 24:43.647
- Yeah, I know. So good.
When I was little,

24:43.649 --> 24:46.250
I used to lick all the envelopes
for our christmas cards.

24:46.252 --> 24:48.251
Judy thought I was being
so helpful.

24:48.287 --> 24:50.921
- Alright, but you were
savouring the taste of the glue
like a little creep.

24:50.990 --> 24:52.622
- Yeah.
- Ah, yeah.

24:54.060 --> 24:57.694
- It's great cake, huh?
- Oh, my god. I am loving it!
So good.

25:04.504 --> 25:06.870
- Mm. Mm...

25:08.340 --> 25:11.008
- Elijah's sending over
the software tomorrow morning.

25:12.245 --> 25:15.145
- Really? That was fast.
- Kelly, I...

25:16.349 --> 25:18.315
...Called in the favour
the minute you asked.

25:31.096 --> 25:33.863
(sighing)
- steve, hi. Ugh. Okay.

25:35.134 --> 25:37.768
I would...
Just be normal. Okay.

25:37.770 --> 25:42.439
I would like to talk to you
about your past indiscretions
in the hopes of getting closure.

25:42.475 --> 25:44.174
Nobody does that.
(knocking)

25:48.080 --> 25:49.713
(sighing)

25:54.487 --> 25:55.885
- Hey.
- Hi.

26:00.993 --> 26:06.263
- You... You look like you've
been making out with a smurf.
- What? Oh, jeez! Oh, uh...

26:06.265 --> 26:08.799
It was kelly's sister's
baby shower.
It-it's blue cake.

26:08.934 --> 26:11.267
She was... Having a boy.
It doesn't matter.

26:11.304 --> 26:13.737
(steve laughing)
did you want a drink?
- Sure.

26:20.079 --> 26:23.546
Remember your baby shower?
Judy got drunk and serenaded you

26:23.583 --> 26:26.684
With an acapella version
of your body is a wonderland.

26:26.819 --> 26:29.820
(laughter)
- oh, my god.

26:29.955 --> 26:33.690
I still don't know
how she thought that was about
a mother-daughter home birth.

26:33.759 --> 26:35.359
(sighing)

26:37.597 --> 26:39.730
- We had fun
when elliot was little.

26:42.268 --> 26:43.667
- We did.

26:45.905 --> 26:47.371
Actually...

26:49.942 --> 26:52.109
...That's what I wanted to talk
to you about.

26:52.111 --> 26:53.877
Kind of what happened
between us?

26:55.781 --> 26:57.247
- Really? Um...

26:58.651 --> 27:00.250
You never wanted to before.

27:00.286 --> 27:02.186
- I know. Yeah.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.722
I just was so angry,

27:05.758 --> 27:09.393
I couldn't. And...

27:11.530 --> 27:13.363
I-I realize now, I just...

27:14.533 --> 27:16.366
St-steve, I really...

27:18.170 --> 27:20.404
I really need closure.

27:20.473 --> 27:22.272
- That's great.

27:23.676 --> 27:27.410
I'm not gonna make any excuses.
I wish I could go back and--

27:27.446 --> 27:29.646
- Not sleep
with our son's gym teacher.

27:31.350 --> 27:33.350
- Biggest regret of my life.

27:33.419 --> 27:37.120
That, and not buying
a rental property before toronto
real estate went nuts.

27:45.197 --> 27:47.364
You ever think we gave up
too quickly?

27:48.434 --> 27:49.999
- Like...

27:51.070 --> 27:54.638
...Left behind a great love...
For example?

27:54.707 --> 27:58.375
- Maybe we didn't leave it
behind.
When I look at you...

28:03.182 --> 28:04.814
...I still feel it.

28:05.584 --> 28:06.883
Sam.

- oh!

28:51.230 --> 28:53.430
(laughter)
- good morning, sunshine.

28:54.767 --> 28:57.301
- Oh, I forgot how you like
to do that to wake me up.

28:57.303 --> 28:59.602
- Well, I can't help it.
It gives me so much joy.

29:00.840 --> 29:03.373
Look what I found on the back
of the bathroom door.

29:03.442 --> 29:06.843
My old faithful.
I guess someone's been...
Thinking about me.

29:06.912 --> 29:09.713
- Or more likely just kept
using it after you were gone,
but okay.

29:17.056 --> 29:19.389
- Coffees on,
bagels are in the toaster.

29:19.458 --> 29:21.558
I'm gonna hop in the shower,
alright?

29:29.067 --> 29:31.034
(doorbell ringing)

29:33.405 --> 29:35.071
- Hi.
- Hi!
- Hey, sorry.

29:35.107 --> 29:37.474
You mind if I just put
these down?
'cause they are really hot!

29:37.609 --> 29:40.010
Ah.
(exclaiming)

29:40.012 --> 29:43.347
I know, I-I know.
Nobody likes a drop-in,

29:43.349 --> 29:46.817
But... I just miss you, sam.

29:46.886 --> 29:51.521
And, um, I know
we've both been super busy,
so I figured I'd take a chance.

29:51.590 --> 29:53.156
(clattering)

29:53.225 --> 29:55.959
- Oh. You know what?
You probably don't want
to be here,

29:56.094 --> 29:59.563
Because my mother now likes
to walk around naked
after a shower.

29:59.632 --> 30:01.364
It's just...
It's a florida thing.

30:01.400 --> 30:04.768
- Okay.
- So...
- Well, we could go out back,

30:04.837 --> 30:07.471
Just like old times. You, me,
and some somalian dark roast?

30:07.473 --> 30:10.007
- Uh... Thank you.

30:10.142 --> 30:12.308
You're really...

30:12.344 --> 30:16.412
Uh, I have to shower for work.
I have to get ready for work.

30:16.448 --> 30:18.448
- Yeah, no, for sure,
of course you do.

30:18.484 --> 30:20.917
- Yeah.
- I-I'll leave you to it.

30:20.953 --> 30:24.121
Seems like you and judy have
some breakfast plans there too,
so...

30:24.123 --> 30:27.124
- Yep.
- Okay. Well, then, I'll go.

30:27.126 --> 30:28.558
- Okay.

30:29.795 --> 30:31.427
- Sam, uh...

30:33.966 --> 30:37.801
I just want to make sure that,
like, um... That we're okay,
right?

30:37.936 --> 30:39.970
- I'm...

30:40.105 --> 30:41.872
I'm a-okay, so...

30:43.609 --> 30:47.411
- Okay, great.
That's great to hear.
I'll see you at work.

30:47.546 --> 30:48.912
- I'll see you at work.

31:07.833 --> 31:10.500
Hey. Duff, could I just talk
to you for a minute about...

31:10.569 --> 31:14.037
Adeline's case.
Is that the thumb drive?
Did you decode it?

31:14.039 --> 31:17.240
Okay, that's great.
What do we have here?

31:17.243 --> 31:20.243
What do we have here...?

31:20.312 --> 31:22.312
- Well, his file has this list
of names.

31:22.314 --> 31:24.180
Most of them are coyotes
who we've already found.

31:24.250 --> 31:27.985
- Strangely, someone
that michaels found yesterday
was also on the list.

31:27.987 --> 31:31.454
- Mm. Lucky spacek?
- The asshole was right
about one thing.

31:31.523 --> 31:34.190
We haven't opened
all the files yet.
- Okay, what's this?

31:41.199 --> 31:44.201
Hey. I-I know that face.
That's enrique flores molina.

31:44.336 --> 31:45.902
It's the cartel boss.

31:47.206 --> 31:50.807
- Yeesh.
This guy's on red notice
for importing cocaine.

31:50.876 --> 31:52.041
- Keep playing.

31:54.546 --> 31:57.714
- What the hell?
- That kid is definitely
underage.

31:59.885 --> 32:03.086
- Oh... God, I gotta stop,
I gotta stop, I gotta stop.

32:03.155 --> 32:06.556
- Why does adeline have this?
(sam and kelly):
She's blackmailing him.

32:06.592 --> 32:09.893
- This is how she got the cartel
to supply the coyotes
the pink cocaine.

32:09.895 --> 32:13.096
Sell me your drugs,
or I tell your macho friends
that you like teenage boys.

32:13.231 --> 32:16.767
- So adeline made the cartel
connect, but will's controlling
everything?

32:16.902 --> 32:19.502
- Explains why she felt entitled
to take over.

32:19.538 --> 32:23.173
- Let's press zorka.
Get her to contact adeline now.

32:24.476 --> 32:26.843
- Balda, I need your help.

32:26.912 --> 32:28.911
Come to the fair now.

32:30.582 --> 32:32.782
There. I left her a message.

32:32.818 --> 32:35.786
It was the place that her father
picked for emergencies.

32:35.921 --> 32:38.789
- You sure adeline's getting
these voicemails?
- Yes.

32:38.924 --> 32:40.590
(phone chiming)
(scoffing)
see?

32:40.592 --> 32:42.793
The smile,
it means she's coming.

32:42.795 --> 32:44.527
- Give me the phone back.

32:44.563 --> 32:47.464
- What if there's an emergency?
- Give me the--

32:47.466 --> 32:50.933
- You need anything,
you just talk into this.
Testing, testing.

32:50.970 --> 32:52.536
Okay, good to go.

32:52.671 --> 32:54.338
- And don't worry,
we'll have eyes on you.

32:54.473 --> 32:56.673
Detectives duff and wazowski
will keep an eye out
for adeline.

32:56.808 --> 32:58.708
Come on,
let's get you into position.

33:01.080 --> 33:03.680
(children laughing)
(fairground music playing)

33:09.955 --> 33:11.555
(cheering)

33:14.493 --> 33:17.828
- This is all a little weird.
- Yup!

33:17.963 --> 33:19.595
<i> (naz): See adeline yet?</i>

33:20.866 --> 33:23.900
- No. Nothing but the butt
of a dinosaur.

33:23.969 --> 33:25.769
- It's called a cloaca,
actually.

33:25.838 --> 33:29.639
It's a three-in-one orifice
and... It do-doesn't matter.

33:30.509 --> 33:32.208
- What's wrong with you today?

33:33.979 --> 33:37.781
- Uh... Do you know that you are
standing behind a historically
inaccurate dinosaur?

33:37.783 --> 33:39.516
The brontosauri actually
never existed.

33:39.651 --> 33:43.253
You know, you spend a long time
believing something
and then bam!

33:43.255 --> 33:45.455
Everything you knew
just isn't true.

33:47.459 --> 33:49.692
(bell ringing)

33:49.762 --> 33:53.129
(sighing)
- she's not coming.
I have a bad feeling.

33:53.265 --> 33:55.665
Balda,
she only thinks of herself.

33:55.667 --> 33:57.934
- Alright, sit tight.
We'll give it
a few more minutes.

34:11.216 --> 34:14.117
- Where the hell is she?
Dammit, let's go!

34:16.021 --> 34:19.356
- Yeah, we lost zorka.
<i> Checking the southeast side</i>
<i> of the mall!</i>

34:19.358 --> 34:21.892
- Got it. We'll go northwest.
Let's go.

34:21.894 --> 34:24.894
- Ugh! Where'd she go?
- I don't know, I don't see her!

34:28.233 --> 34:31.501
- Oh, eyes on zorka!
She's with a man, blue shirt,
by the brontosaurus!

34:31.636 --> 34:33.370
- Brachiosaurus!
- Ugh!

34:33.372 --> 34:37.940
(dinging)
- no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
(train whistle blowing)

34:41.547 --> 34:43.479
Come on, move!

34:43.515 --> 34:45.582
(soft french music)

34:47.519 --> 34:49.119
- Hey, here!

34:59.598 --> 35:00.797
- Come on!

35:09.675 --> 35:12.074
Let's go!
(groaning and panting)

35:14.580 --> 35:17.313
Excuse me!
- Go, go, go! Excuse me!

35:20.619 --> 35:23.019
(zorka crying out and groaning)

35:30.462 --> 35:32.696
(train whistle blowing)

35:32.831 --> 35:34.931
- Go, go, go.

35:38.470 --> 35:41.103
(kelly): Hey! Sam, this way!

35:43.775 --> 35:46.176
- Stop!
- Stop! Police!

35:49.481 --> 35:51.914
(grunting)

35:53.318 --> 35:55.618
- Gtpd! Get your hands
behind your back!

35:55.654 --> 35:58.054
- Balda sent them to take me.

35:58.090 --> 36:02.058
- Take you?
You paid me 500 bucks
to get you outta there.

36:02.094 --> 36:06.395
- No. No, no, no. Mm-mm.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.500
(police-radio chatter)

36:11.803 --> 36:14.371
- So dude over here says
he doesn't even know adeline.

36:14.373 --> 36:17.941
- Yeah, and zorka says
she never gave him any money.
- So who do we believe?

36:17.943 --> 36:20.877
Bad guy ride-share
or snake oil saleswoman?

36:22.648 --> 36:26.082
Well, adelina's a nightmare,
but she's still the only family
zorka's got left,

36:26.151 --> 36:28.952
And she's still the strongest
lead in our coyote case.

36:29.021 --> 36:32.655
- Okay, so where the hell
is adeline?

36:34.459 --> 36:37.627
- I hope you all had a chance
to finish reading the haunting
of chauncey dubois,

36:37.629 --> 36:40.563
Because there will be
some spoilers!

36:40.632 --> 36:44.034
- Spoilers as in rotten?
Because I tried to read it,

36:44.169 --> 36:47.170
But it stinks!
Don't you guys...

36:47.305 --> 36:50.073
Think... Think so?

36:50.208 --> 36:53.910
- Uh, so anyone want to try
my bean salad?

36:54.880 --> 36:57.647
- So anyway, the other day,

36:57.649 --> 36:59.783
I was playing with my cat,
cloudy -

36:59.918 --> 37:03.253
He's the scottish fold
with the bladder crystals -
when all of a sudden,

37:03.322 --> 37:08.057
His favourite cat toy started
to sway all on its own.

37:09.461 --> 37:12.628
I wasn't moving it,
and cloudy certainly
wasn't moving it!

37:13.799 --> 37:15.465
And I was wondering,

37:15.600 --> 37:18.735
Maybe it was the air
conditioner!
But it's broken!

37:18.870 --> 37:20.836
Not that my landlord cares.
(chuckling)

37:22.641 --> 37:25.208
- Do any of us really care?
(guffawing)

37:25.210 --> 37:28.478
(woman): Okay, who here
has slept with their landlord?

37:28.547 --> 37:31.080
(sighing)
(woman): Huh?
(laughing)

37:37.322 --> 37:40.289
(door opening)
- oh, hey, hi! Come on in.

37:40.325 --> 37:42.425
What a nice surprise.
She's in there.

37:42.427 --> 37:44.093
- Okay.

37:44.129 --> 37:47.563
- Sam! What are you doing here?
- Oh, well, the lights were on,

37:47.565 --> 37:51.301
I was passing by and I was,
like: "hey, I'll just..."
that's a lie.

37:57.843 --> 38:00.676
I just wanted to talk
about the other day with zorka.

38:02.380 --> 38:05.848
- What about it?
- Uh, the whole thing
about us being family,

38:05.884 --> 38:08.218
And then you feeling lost
and neglected because...

38:08.353 --> 38:11.321
We didn't come by
to check on you.

38:12.557 --> 38:14.991
(chuckling, then laughing)

38:16.328 --> 38:19.395
- I was acting.
I had to give her something.

38:20.198 --> 38:22.131
- Sounded true.

38:24.402 --> 38:26.402
- Oh, sam. Sam...

38:26.438 --> 38:28.872
Ah! Come on.

38:30.876 --> 38:34.143
I'm fine.
Yeah, I'm a little bored,

38:34.212 --> 38:38.348
A lot frustrated,
but... I'm fine.

38:38.483 --> 38:40.149
- Good.

38:44.189 --> 38:45.821
- Liz? Elizabeth!

38:47.326 --> 38:50.626
Kevin, he-he's... He's walking,
he's eating.
What'd you give him?

38:50.662 --> 38:54.029
- Nothing,
other than that water.

38:54.066 --> 38:55.932
(gasping)

38:55.934 --> 38:57.433
- Mm...

38:59.271 --> 39:01.671
- Night, judy.
- Michaela.
(fake laugh)

39:04.442 --> 39:07.376
- "so my scottish fold
said to my air conditioner,

39:07.412 --> 39:09.112
'maybe we're both haunted.' "

39:09.181 --> 39:12.515
- I think you are gonna be
haunted by michaela's bean salad
tonight.

39:12.584 --> 39:15.918
I've never seen someone pretend
to enjoy legumes so much.

39:15.987 --> 39:19.722
- Well, what can I say?
I'm really good at pretending.

39:19.725 --> 39:22.058
- Yeah?
- Pretending to like things,

39:22.060 --> 39:24.059
Pretending to be someone
I'm not.

39:25.263 --> 39:27.864
- Why is that?
- My mother never approved
of me.

39:29.334 --> 39:32.001
If she could've chosen
a different daughter,
she would've.

39:32.003 --> 39:35.138
- I think that's how my daughter
feels about me.
- But you guys live together,

39:35.140 --> 39:37.540
Right? You're not... Close?

39:37.576 --> 39:41.010
- Well, I try to be,
but sam's never here. She's a...

39:41.079 --> 39:43.079
She's a cop. Total workaholic.

39:43.081 --> 39:45.682
(sighing)
obsessed with this new case.

39:45.684 --> 39:47.951
- Ooh! True crime!
- Mm.

39:48.086 --> 39:50.954
Although I bet
you can't really tell me
about it, though, right?

39:51.089 --> 39:52.822
- Well, I don't really know
that much,

39:52.957 --> 39:56.959
But she thinks
this real-estate agent's
overdose was actually a murder.

39:56.995 --> 39:59.262
H-honestly, I don't know.
(laughing)

39:59.264 --> 40:01.364
- Well...

40:01.433 --> 40:05.168
If my mother would rather
a different daughter,

40:05.170 --> 40:08.638
And your daughter would rather
a different mother, then maybe
they don't deserve us.

40:08.640 --> 40:10.406
- Maybe they don't.

40:10.442 --> 40:12.175
- Good night, new mommy.
(laughter)

40:12.244 --> 40:14.710
- Good night, sweetie.
- Will I see you soon?

40:14.712 --> 40:16.379
- Absolutely.

40:17.015 --> 40:18.814
(chuckling)

40:19.885 --> 40:21.951
(sighing)

40:23.221 --> 40:24.820
(door opening)

40:27.659 --> 40:29.291
- Hi.
(kelly chuckling)

40:30.261 --> 40:32.128
You forget something, or...

40:32.263 --> 40:35.531
- Uh, no. I...

40:35.667 --> 40:38.000
Actually wanted to talk to you.
Um...

40:40.005 --> 40:41.738
(sighing)

40:41.873 --> 40:45.875
I know I haven't been
very supportive,
or at all supportive, really.

40:47.012 --> 40:48.577
(sighing)

40:50.182 --> 40:52.348
I'm happy for you guys.

40:53.618 --> 40:56.151
It's just...
(sighing)

40:56.188 --> 40:58.621
...Not the easiest thing for me
to show up for.

40:58.756 --> 41:03.293
- Why?
- Because... I want a baby too.

41:05.330 --> 41:08.965
It's like this emptiness inside.
(sighing)

41:10.935 --> 41:13.570
- Well, are you sure you want
a baby? 'cause it kind of sounds
like you want to eat a baby.

41:13.572 --> 41:16.172
(kelly chuckling)
maybe you should've had
more cake.

41:16.174 --> 41:17.773
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:17.809 --> 41:21.377
I guess you don't know what
it feels like to be jealous...

41:21.379 --> 41:22.979
Miss perfect.

41:23.048 --> 41:25.247
- Oh, miss perfect?
- Yeah.
- Oh.

41:25.283 --> 41:29.118
May I remind you that
I'm having this baby on my own?

41:29.120 --> 41:31.287
It's far from what I wanted.

41:32.790 --> 41:35.391
And believe it or not,
I was jealous of you
when we were kids.

41:35.393 --> 41:38.728
Yes, you were my confident,
funny-as-hell sister

41:38.797 --> 41:40.730
That all of my friends
wanted to be friends with,

41:40.799 --> 41:43.132
And all of my crushes
wanted to date.

41:43.201 --> 41:47.870
- Let's be clear, okay?
At home, I was the underdog,
like, dead last.

41:47.873 --> 41:49.739
- Well, then try putting
yourself first for once.

41:49.808 --> 41:53.343
That's why I'm doing this
on my own.
I am putting what I want first.

41:53.478 --> 41:56.679
So hey, if there's something
that you want,

41:56.681 --> 41:58.681
Go get it.

41:58.816 --> 42:00.749
You have one life, right?

42:00.785 --> 42:03.019
(phone buzzing)

42:03.021 --> 42:04.820
- Yeah.

42:04.856 --> 42:06.356
- It's okay, get it.

42:08.093 --> 42:10.493
(sighing)
you're a cop,
answer your goddamn phone.

42:10.562 --> 42:12.161
- Okay, okay, okay.

42:14.699 --> 42:16.298
Hey, nathan.

42:18.436 --> 42:20.436
Okay.

42:20.438 --> 42:22.438
I'll be right there. Yeah.

42:24.576 --> 42:26.141
(sighing)

42:27.012 --> 42:29.312
- I love you.
- I love you.

42:29.314 --> 42:30.913
And I love you.

42:30.949 --> 42:33.415
- Yes. Go.
- Bye! Okay!

42:37.722 --> 42:39.455
What's going on?

42:39.457 --> 42:41.924
- Adeline french's evidence
files have been scrambled.

42:41.993 --> 42:45.194
- What?
- All the photos,
everything on the drive: Gone.

42:45.263 --> 42:48.931
- But the drive was in evidence.
Only police had access to it.
- Exactly.

42:51.303 --> 42:54.870
- So adeline has someone inside
covering her tracks.

42:54.940 --> 42:57.273
- Which means the oce
has a dirty cop.

42:59.277 --> 43:02.211
- Michaels is losing it
right now.
He's locking everything down.

43:02.247 --> 43:04.013
I wanted you to know, alright?

43:04.015 --> 43:06.849
- Greene. My office. Now.

43:41.052 --> 43:43.018
Subtitling: Difuze
