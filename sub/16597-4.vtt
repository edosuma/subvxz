WEBVTT

00:06.840 --> 00:08.709
This menu's
like 30 pages long.

00:08.742 --> 00:11.079
I haven't had to read this
much since med school.

00:12.313 --> 00:13.381
Why do we
always come here?

00:13.414 --> 00:14.782
Tradition.

00:14.815 --> 00:17.185
Whenever Welltopia
hires a new doctor,

00:17.218 --> 00:19.720
we treat them
to a "get to know you" lunch.

00:19.753 --> 00:21.622
But I already know
Allison.

00:22.323 --> 00:23.557
And for you, ma'am?

00:23.591 --> 00:25.426
Uh, I'll have
the "Ahi tuna salad."

00:25.459 --> 00:27.961
(INHALES SHARPLY) Are you
sure you want the tuna?

00:27.995 --> 00:29.097
Why?
Is it not good here?

00:29.130 --> 00:30.664
Oh, no. I just mean
because of that time

00:30.698 --> 00:32.833
that you were in Costa Rica
with Ken and you ordered
the bad tuna

00:32.866 --> 00:35.803
and then had three days of,
you know, bubble guts.

00:37.438 --> 00:38.639
No, that was Belize.

00:38.672 --> 00:40.741
Oh, that's right. Yeah, she
ruined the Costa Rica trip

00:40.774 --> 00:42.476
by running over a sloth.

00:44.145 --> 00:45.779
I see the
"get to know Allison" lunch

00:45.813 --> 00:47.681
has been happening
for several years.

00:47.715 --> 00:49.983
In my defense,
I always start with,

00:50.017 --> 00:52.753
"This can't get back
to Allison."

00:52.786 --> 00:54.655
How about a moratorium
on intimate details

00:54.688 --> 00:55.989
about our personal life,
okay?

00:56.023 --> 00:57.458
Absolutely.

00:57.491 --> 01:00.528
Guys, as you may remember
from our fight in the
Virgin Islands,

01:00.561 --> 01:03.931
Allison
is very thin-skinned.

01:03.964 --> 01:06.434
So no more talk about
awkward personal stuff.

01:10.538 --> 01:13.607
So, I probably shouldn't
bring up the fact

01:13.641 --> 01:16.377
that your dad is over there
with a shapely blonde gal?

01:19.480 --> 01:21.615
Oh, that's probably
the real-estate lady

01:21.649 --> 01:23.451
that's selling
your parents' condo.

01:23.484 --> 01:26.154
Mmm. I'd let her show
me her listings.

01:29.022 --> 01:31.492
What? It's a dynamite time
to buy right now.

01:32.760 --> 01:36.864
Oh, snap.
He's feeding her cheesecake!

01:36.897 --> 01:41.001
Well...maybe her arms
don't work, right, Allison?

01:41.034 --> 01:42.303
Maybe?

01:44.638 --> 01:47.208
Nope.
The arms are good.

01:50.178 --> 01:52.513
Oh, man,
the lips work, too.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.491
Hey, Dad.
How's it going?
Mmm.

02:04.925 --> 02:06.694
Do anything special
for lunch today?

02:06.727 --> 02:08.596
(SIGHS)
Cheesecake Factory.

02:08.629 --> 02:10.298
That menu is so big.

02:10.331 --> 02:12.500
Took longer to read
than Da Vinci Code.

02:14.168 --> 02:17.571
Wow, not gonna deny it.
I was there, Dad.

02:17.605 --> 02:19.072
I saw you
with that lady.

02:19.106 --> 02:20.708
How could you do this
to Mom?

02:20.741 --> 02:22.676
I wasn't cheating,
if that's what you think.

02:22.710 --> 02:24.378
Oh, please,
the Cheesecake Factory

02:24.412 --> 02:26.847
hasn't seen that much action
since prom night.

02:30.384 --> 02:32.152
I wasn't cheating
on your mom

02:32.186 --> 02:33.521
because...

02:33.554 --> 02:35.055
Your mother and I
got divorced.

02:35.088 --> 02:37.725
What? When?

02:37.758 --> 02:40.027
Well, let's see.
Today's Thursday.

02:40.060 --> 02:41.662
March 2014.

02:44.832 --> 02:46.033
What happened?

02:46.066 --> 02:47.435
We just grew apart.

02:47.468 --> 02:49.169
Wait. This doesn't
make any sense.

02:49.203 --> 02:51.171
I saw you and Mom last year
for Thanksgiving

02:51.205 --> 02:52.606
and a bunch of times
since then.

02:52.640 --> 02:55.576
Yes, we kept up appearances.
We didn't want you to worry.

02:55.609 --> 02:58.312
Okay, so Mom didn't go
to Korea because
Grandma was sick?

02:58.346 --> 03:00.381
No, no, Grandma
was sick. Eczema.

03:00.414 --> 03:01.849
Got ointment, got better,

03:01.882 --> 03:03.851
and now she's playing
golf again.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.086
This is crazy!

03:06.119 --> 03:09.457
You got divorced and didn't
tell your grown children?

03:09.490 --> 03:11.625
Oh, no, no, no.
We told your
sister right away.

03:13.093 --> 03:14.562
Wendi was our rock.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.530
Wait. You told Wendi,
but not me?

03:16.564 --> 03:18.732
Well, I can explain.

03:18.766 --> 03:20.334
We thought
you couldn't handle it.

03:21.001 --> 03:22.135
Based on what?

03:22.169 --> 03:24.137
Based on your long history
of not handling things.

03:24.972 --> 03:26.206
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

03:26.240 --> 03:27.475
You do seem upset.

03:27.508 --> 03:29.109
Well, yeah,
I'm not a robot.

03:29.142 --> 03:31.745
I mean, you know, my parents
getting divorced
is a big deal.

03:31.779 --> 03:34.448
I'm upset, but not
end-of-the-world
upset, you know?

03:34.482 --> 03:36.584
You know, this...this is
what you and Mom really want.

03:36.617 --> 03:38.185
You know,
I'm fine with it.

03:39.387 --> 03:40.421
So you're okay?

03:40.454 --> 03:42.590
(SCOFFS)
Dad, am I ever really okay?

03:42.623 --> 03:43.991
(LAUGHS)

03:44.024 --> 03:45.793
You know I'm always
on the brink of something.

03:45.826 --> 03:47.361
(LAUGHS)

03:47.395 --> 03:49.563
Look, I'm a grown man.
You're a grown man.

03:49.597 --> 03:52.833
If you and Mom are happy,
then I'm happy.

03:52.866 --> 03:56.937
Well...sorry
I underestimated you.

03:56.970 --> 03:58.639
It's okay.

03:58.672 --> 04:00.474
I'm gonna go
grab a beer.

04:00.508 --> 04:01.509
Would you like one?

04:01.942 --> 04:02.976
No.

04:08.816 --> 04:11.819
(SILENT SCREAMING)

04:17.358 --> 04:18.726
So, how'd it go?

04:36.477 --> 04:37.745
Hey, guys.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.279
Uh, I have something
important... Aah!

04:41.549 --> 04:42.683
Hi, Emily.

04:42.716 --> 04:45.553
I know, right?
Always out of nowhere.

04:45.586 --> 04:47.821
Um, Emily,
this is a family matter,

04:47.855 --> 04:49.523
so would you mind giving us
a little privacy?

04:54.061 --> 04:55.228
Maybe a little more.

04:55.996 --> 04:57.398
Come on, Em.

04:57.431 --> 04:59.867
We'll get to the tale
of the other city tomorrow.

05:01.835 --> 05:03.003
See you later, babe.

05:06.206 --> 05:08.175
Anyway,
I do have some news.

05:08.208 --> 05:10.411
Molly, why don't you join
Dave on the couch?

05:12.880 --> 05:14.382
(SIGHS)

05:14.415 --> 05:17.918
Grandma and Grandpa Park
have gotten divorced.

05:17.951 --> 05:19.787
Now, I know this news
comes as a shock,

05:19.820 --> 05:23.724
so it's perfectly natural
for you to feel sad or upset.

05:24.625 --> 05:26.026
Thanks.
Okay.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.095
That's it?

05:28.128 --> 05:31.331
Well, it's a bummer, but 52%
of marriages end in divorce,

05:31.365 --> 05:32.933
and if it's
for the best...

05:32.966 --> 05:35.369
From what Grandpa told Dad,
it is for the best,

05:35.403 --> 05:37.137
and he and Grandma
are both fine.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.706
What about Dad?
Is he okay?

05:40.207 --> 05:42.042
Yeah,
he's in the shower.

05:42.075 --> 05:43.944
That's where Dad
goes to cry.

05:44.745 --> 05:46.680
He also cries
in the shed.

05:47.615 --> 05:49.149
Okay, we all
know your dad

05:49.182 --> 05:52.686
has the emotional stability
of a contestant on
The Bachelor.

05:52.720 --> 05:56.524
But that's why we're gonna
help him get through this.

05:56.557 --> 05:58.191
Got it?

05:58.225 --> 06:00.994
Wow. Life unfolds
so unpredictably.

06:06.299 --> 06:07.635
Don't worry about Dave.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.670
According to
my A.P. psychology textbook,

06:09.703 --> 06:12.573
it seems like a simple case
of adjustment disorder.

06:12.606 --> 06:14.041
I'll watch him
for signs of stress

06:14.074 --> 06:18.211
and recommend a treatment
protocol if necessary.

06:18.245 --> 06:20.981
Aren't you only two weeks
into that psychology class?

06:21.014 --> 06:22.249
I read ahead.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.456
Hey, Mom.

06:28.489 --> 06:30.290
When you get a chance,
call me back.

06:30.323 --> 06:32.860
Seems we have a couple things
to catch up on,

06:32.893 --> 06:35.696
like, I don't know,
who's married and who isn't.

06:35.729 --> 06:36.997
Call me.

06:37.998 --> 06:40.468
Hey.
How you doing?

06:40.501 --> 06:44.404
They "grew apart."
What does that even mean?

06:44.438 --> 06:46.774
If anything,
they've grown more alike.

06:46.807 --> 06:49.477
Mom's mustache is giving
Dad's a run for its money.

06:50.844 --> 06:52.780
I think
it looks distinguished.

06:54.147 --> 06:57.284
I don't know.
I need to fix this, Allison.

06:57.317 --> 06:59.419
Honey, unfortunately,
you can't fix it.

06:59.453 --> 07:00.721
All you can do
is accept it.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.255
You accept it!

07:03.056 --> 07:04.124
I have.

07:04.157 --> 07:05.793
Whoa!
Stop yelling at me.

07:06.960 --> 07:10.063
Listen, I know
this is upsetting, but...

07:10.097 --> 07:11.899
How do I put
this gently?

07:11.932 --> 07:13.601
You're in your mid-40s.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.203
Yeah, and all
those years,

07:16.236 --> 07:18.806
I never questioned
my parents' marriage.

07:18.839 --> 07:20.373
They moved here
from Korea.

07:20.407 --> 07:23.176
All they had was each other
and that's what got
them through.

07:23.210 --> 07:25.178
Or at least that's the lie
they were shucking.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.085
I don't even know
what to believe anymore.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.787
Maybe they were
never really happy.

07:35.489 --> 07:37.925
(SIGHS)
This doesn't mean
they were never happy.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.793
Do they look happy?

07:39.827 --> 07:40.961
Well, that's
a bad example.

07:40.994 --> 07:42.663
Hard-core Koreans never
smile in pictures.

07:42.696 --> 07:44.765
It's a sign of weakness.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.467
They're probably happy.
They're at Sizzler.

07:49.036 --> 07:50.137
Or maybe
they're thinking,

07:50.170 --> 07:53.006
"I can't wait to run
screaming from this marriage."

07:53.040 --> 07:55.008
And why am I
in a sailor suit?

07:55.042 --> 07:56.443
Was I in the navy
when I was 4?

07:56.476 --> 07:58.178
I don't know
what's real anymore.

07:59.412 --> 08:00.914
I'll be in
the shower.

08:05.919 --> 08:08.221
Hey, what are you
still doing up?

08:08.255 --> 08:10.858
I was doing
some troubling research.

08:10.891 --> 08:13.927
It turns out as
a child of a child of divorce,

08:13.961 --> 08:16.730
I'm more likely to get
divorced myself someday.

08:18.098 --> 08:20.133
And how does that
make you feel?

08:21.068 --> 08:22.570
Not great, Molly.

08:24.037 --> 08:25.673
Emily and I are doomed.

08:26.439 --> 08:27.875
Okay.

08:27.908 --> 08:31.211
This is a transference
of worry that's not
age-appropriate.

08:31.244 --> 08:33.547
Can you say that in a way
that is age-appropriate?

08:34.615 --> 08:36.584
You're being dumb.

08:36.617 --> 08:38.351
Could've
split the difference.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.457
So, get this.

08:44.491 --> 08:46.459
My dad wasn't cheating
on my mom.

08:46.493 --> 08:49.830
They got divorced
after 50 years.

08:50.731 --> 08:52.633
Oh, and I may have
been in the navy.

08:55.468 --> 08:57.370
You should look at this
from your dad's point of view.

08:58.271 --> 09:00.040
You're right.
He is going through a lot.

09:00.073 --> 09:01.441
Yeah, through
a lot of tail.

09:03.176 --> 09:06.814
He's out there crushing it
like an Asian Charles Bronson.

09:06.847 --> 09:09.783
Rocking that stainless-steel
barbecue brush of a mustache

09:09.817 --> 09:11.218
like he was
born with it.

09:12.786 --> 09:14.321
Ken, I need to prowl
the single scene

09:14.354 --> 09:16.189
with the silver fox
you call Dad.

09:17.257 --> 09:18.491
Make it happen.

09:21.461 --> 09:23.496
You want to know
the worst part of all this?

09:23.530 --> 09:24.998
Sorry. That wasn't it?

09:25.966 --> 09:28.235
Their marriage
seemed so solid.

09:28.268 --> 09:30.638
I mean, if they could crap
out, anybody could.

09:30.671 --> 09:32.505
Unh-unh! Unh-unh!
Not Barack and Michelle!

09:32.539 --> 09:34.975
Don't you even!

09:35.008 --> 09:36.877
I mean, you're not
worried about you
and Allison, are you?

09:36.910 --> 09:40.180
Yo! Why would you
say that to him?

09:40.748 --> 09:42.349
I don't know.

09:42.382 --> 09:43.984
(STUTTERS) I wasn't worried,
but I am now.

09:45.819 --> 09:47.788
Ow!

09:47.821 --> 09:49.389
But... But... I...
I mean, your parents,

09:49.422 --> 09:51.458
they probably got married
really young, right?

09:51.491 --> 09:53.226
Yeah, that's true.
Yeah.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.528
But Allison and I
got married young,

09:55.562 --> 09:57.164
and they had a daughter
and a son

09:57.197 --> 09:59.532
with the same age difference
as Molly and Dave.

09:59.566 --> 10:02.269
Oh, my God,
I have the same marriage
as my parents,

10:02.302 --> 10:03.704
except that
Allison's mustache

10:03.737 --> 10:05.338
is less aggressive
than my mom's!

10:06.940 --> 10:09.677
Will you stop freaking out?
No two marriages are alike.

10:09.710 --> 10:12.045
You're right.
Theirs was better.

10:12.079 --> 10:13.981
They never argued!

10:14.014 --> 10:15.482
I mean,
I can't go two days

10:15.515 --> 10:17.550
without doing something
to piss off Allison.

10:17.584 --> 10:18.819
Not just Allison.

10:20.888 --> 10:22.422
Well, what does
she complain about?

10:22.455 --> 10:24.958
Well, she's always saying
I'm not attentive,

10:24.992 --> 10:28.595
I'm not romantic,
I minimize her feelings.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.831
But I don't even count
that one because,
you know, who cares?

10:33.834 --> 10:36.036
You know who else
has those same flaws?

10:36.069 --> 10:38.238
Papa.

10:38.271 --> 10:40.808
I have to fix this marriage
before it's too late.

10:40.841 --> 10:44.778
The cycle of shattered
families ends now.

10:44.812 --> 10:47.614
Hold up. Mr. Zimmer's here for
a follow-up on his tendonitis.

10:47.647 --> 10:51.218
The cycle of shattered
families ends in
about 20 minutes.

10:59.727 --> 11:03.797
Happy lunch hour, colleague
and light of my life.

11:03.831 --> 11:05.933
Ditch that soggy sandwich...
Kobe.

11:08.301 --> 11:11.504
'Cause you're about to feast
on a taste of Bangkok.

11:11.538 --> 11:12.706
(LAUGHS)

11:12.740 --> 11:15.709
Which I know you love
because you said
it in the past,

11:15.743 --> 11:17.410
and I double-checked
with Molly.

11:18.445 --> 11:19.747
Wow!

11:19.780 --> 11:20.881
(GASPS)
Ta-da!

11:20.914 --> 11:24.084
Dahlias.
My favorite.

11:24.117 --> 11:26.086
"Sorry for your loss"?

11:26.119 --> 11:27.821
No. Ignore that. I...

11:27.855 --> 11:29.089
I swiped them
from the chapel.

11:29.122 --> 11:31.458
I was gonna buy some,
but I ran out of time.

11:31.491 --> 11:34.161
Mr. Zimmer's tendonitis turned
out to be a hairline fracture.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.729
Okay,
what's happening here?

11:35.763 --> 11:38.265
Well, medically speaking,
sometimes a wrist x-ray
won't show the...

11:38.298 --> 11:40.067
No, Ken. With this.

11:40.734 --> 11:41.802
(SIGHS)

11:41.835 --> 11:43.971
Look, maybe
I'm crazy, but I...

11:44.004 --> 11:46.907
I'm afraid we could end up
like my parents.

11:46.940 --> 11:49.977
I mean, think about it.
Our marriages
are very similar.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.912
Okay, that is crazy.

11:51.945 --> 11:54.314
We're nothing
like your parents.

11:54.347 --> 11:55.749
We love each other,

11:55.783 --> 11:58.051
and we accept each
other for who we are.

11:59.286 --> 12:02.322
Thanks, Al.
I really needed that.

12:02.355 --> 12:03.891
Oh, no.

12:03.924 --> 12:07.360
What? What are you
in the process
of overthinking?

12:07.394 --> 12:09.830
My mother said
almost the exact same
thing to my dad

12:09.863 --> 12:12.432
on their 30th anniversary
at the Sizzler!

12:14.935 --> 12:16.136
(SIGHS)

12:18.638 --> 12:20.874
Wait. So I don't get
the nice lunch?

12:20.908 --> 12:22.810
Sorry, I need to go
eat my feelings.

12:22.843 --> 12:24.144
(SIGHS)

12:24.177 --> 12:25.578
Seriously?
The flowers, too?

12:26.814 --> 12:28.048
They're pretty.

12:29.416 --> 12:30.483
A little help?

12:38.859 --> 12:40.527
How was school?

12:40.560 --> 12:42.629
Ugh. Can we dispense
with the small talk?

12:42.662 --> 12:44.397
I'm not big on that
these days.

12:46.233 --> 12:48.701
Besides,
the real question is...

12:49.502 --> 12:50.938
How are you?

12:53.006 --> 12:54.441
Okay.

12:54.474 --> 12:57.744
You know, it's okay to admit
that you're not okay.

12:58.946 --> 13:00.047
Okay.

13:01.714 --> 13:05.018
That's it.
Let it all out.

13:10.323 --> 13:11.724
What's going on?

13:11.758 --> 13:14.561
Why did you wait so long to
tell us about you and Grandma?

13:14.594 --> 13:17.130
We were afraid your father
couldn't handle it.

13:17.164 --> 13:20.633
But he surprised me.
He put big-boy pants on.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.337
Maybe for a minute,

13:24.371 --> 13:26.473
but then he went to
his room and wet them.

13:28.775 --> 13:29.977
He's not okay.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.511
Then why
did he say he was?

13:32.812 --> 13:34.481
Maybe you
should ask him.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.818
Well, that's our time.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.261
Jail... How appropriate

13:48.295 --> 13:50.563
since we're all
prisoners of fate anyway.

13:52.765 --> 13:53.833
Something wrong?

13:53.867 --> 13:55.936
Boy, someone's
in a chatty mood.

13:57.871 --> 14:00.773
Sorry. I'm having a hard time
continuing this charade

14:00.807 --> 14:03.210
when we both know
it's doomed to fail.

14:04.777 --> 14:06.146
Let's just
play the game.

14:08.015 --> 14:09.316
Ooh, doubles.

14:13.453 --> 14:14.754
Boy, I am so tired.

14:14.787 --> 14:16.223
(BANGS ON GLASS)
Oh!

14:16.256 --> 14:18.291
Oh, man!
Who knocks like that?

14:19.859 --> 14:24.497
That's my dad's knock.
Hard-core Koreans
never adjust for glass.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.199
I'm not ready to talk to him.
It's too soon.

14:26.233 --> 14:27.734
No, no, no.
Tell him I'm not here.
Say I'm at home.

14:27.767 --> 14:28.801
You live with him.

14:28.835 --> 14:31.138
Tell him I'm at work.
These are not great ideas!

14:31.171 --> 14:33.206
Just... You know what?
Just go. Go.
We'll cover for you.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.841
Clark, cover for him.
No, no.

14:34.874 --> 14:35.976
I do not lie...
I'm a terrible liar...

14:36.009 --> 14:37.077
No, I'm not doing it.
No, you...

14:37.110 --> 14:38.145
Hi!
Hey.

14:39.746 --> 14:41.181
I need to
speak with Ken.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.383
Um, yeah, Clark,
do that,

14:43.416 --> 14:45.318
'cause I'm minding my
business around here.

14:46.419 --> 14:50.123
Uh, so sorry,
but, uh, he's...

14:50.157 --> 14:52.025
He's at a conference.

14:52.059 --> 14:54.094
Yeah, with other hiders,
other doctors.

14:55.028 --> 14:56.763

14:56.796 --> 14:58.698
The Korean Tom Selleck.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.902
You know, I would love
to pick your studly brain

15:02.936 --> 15:04.871
for some
dating pointers.

15:04.904 --> 15:08.108
You know,

15:08.141 --> 15:11.211
Hey, what do you say
we mosey across the street
and I'll buy you a beer?

15:11.244 --> 15:13.846
You can buy me a beer,
but I don't mosey.

15:14.814 --> 15:16.984
There's that
legendary charisma

15:17.017 --> 15:19.119
that sends Realtor
panties floor-ward.

15:21.021 --> 15:22.855
After you, Professor.

15:26.359 --> 15:28.295
Is he gone?
Yes, thank God.

15:28.328 --> 15:30.530
You know lying
stresses me out.

15:30.563 --> 15:31.631
Listen to me,
little man.

15:31.664 --> 15:33.166
You got to make peace
with your father.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.534
When my parents
got divorced,

15:34.567 --> 15:37.004
I fell out with my dad
and we never resolved it.

15:37.037 --> 15:39.072
Don't wait
until it's too late.

15:41.108 --> 15:43.610
Thanks, Damona.

15:43.643 --> 15:45.678
You could still work it out
with your dad, couldn't you?

15:45.712 --> 15:46.879
It's never too late.

15:46.913 --> 15:48.415

15:48.448 --> 15:50.817
You know my father died
five years ago!

15:50.850 --> 15:53.286

That don't make no sense!

15:53.320 --> 15:55.955
Here, here, these are for you!
And don't ignore the card!
It applies!

15:59.326 --> 16:00.893
Your father's not dead.

16:00.927 --> 16:02.262
I know. He's just
so easy to get.

16:12.272 --> 16:13.306

16:19.346 --> 16:21.581

about it anymore.

16:21.614 --> 16:22.615
We're breaking up.

16:23.150 --> 16:24.451
Oh, no.

16:27.354 --> 16:30.057
Let's face it.
Our fate was sealed long ago.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.858
Grandchild of divorce.

16:33.093 --> 16:34.927
Okay, hang on.

16:34.961 --> 16:37.964

join Dave on the couch?

pedigree cancels out
your tarnished one.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.945

to worry about.

16:52.979 --> 16:55.014

of it that way.

a self-involved oaf

16:57.984 --> 16:59.986

has changed,

17:40.160 --> 17:41.994
Oh, your
son is here.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.098
And I've got nothing
to learn from him.

17:59.146 --> 18:00.713
So...

18:00.747 --> 18:02.915
...you're not okay
with our divorce.

18:04.251 --> 18:05.485
No, Dad.

So help me out.

that even mean?

left the house,

18:15.495 --> 18:17.497
your mom wanted to
move back to Korea.

I wanted to stay here.

is doing great.

18:45.558 --> 18:47.194

We should've
told you sooner.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.299
I'm sorry.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.137
It's okay.

18:58.171 --> 19:00.307

you weren't gonna
tell me eventually.
