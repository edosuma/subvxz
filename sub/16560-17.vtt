WEBVTT

00:19.227 --> 00:21.146
Hey, I'm on a run.
I'm gonna have to call you back.

00:21.938 --> 00:23.690
Look, I'm sorry,
but I told you already,

00:23.773 --> 00:24.983
I've made up my mind.

00:31.031 --> 00:33.199
And MCL takes the lead!

00:33.742 --> 00:36.536
Can the EMPD come back
in the final moments?

00:36.619 --> 00:37.620
I don't think so.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.330
You're about
to learn the hard way, doctor.

00:39.414 --> 00:40.665
Yeah? Yeah?

00:43.126 --> 00:44.127
Oh, come on!

00:45.253 --> 00:46.588
See, I like that.
I like beating through my friend.

00:46.671 --> 00:47.630
Yeah?

00:50.884 --> 00:51.885
You know,

00:52.177 --> 00:54.637
for a guy who needs a kidney
transplant, you're going kind of hard.

00:54.721 --> 00:56.389
-Shouldn't you be taking it easy?
-Negative Cap.

00:56.473 --> 00:58.975
High-intensity exercise
increases the cardiac output.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.644
Lowers the blood pressure,
increases the renal profusion.

01:01.728 --> 01:04.147
You trying to throw me off my game
with fancy doctor words, aren't you?

01:04.230 --> 01:05.607
-Is that what I'm doing?
-Yeah, it's not gonna work.

01:05.690 --> 01:08.151
-No?
-No, it's not gonna work. You see?

01:10.653 --> 01:11.654
Well...

01:12.322 --> 01:14.407
What are you doing?
You taking my pulse?

01:14.491 --> 01:16.367
-I just got to check your vitals.
-Okay.

01:16.451 --> 01:18.286
Rosie, I know a transplant's
serious business,

01:18.369 --> 01:20.914
but I run a 7-minute mile,
I bench 325.

01:20.997 --> 01:23.208
-I think I'm gonna be all right.
-Just got to make sure.

01:25.293 --> 01:28.004
You know, we both know
that I wasn't the match you expected,

01:28.088 --> 01:29.380
but I'm glad it was me.

01:30.006 --> 01:31.966
That is assuming my kidney's
good enough for you.

01:32.383 --> 01:34.052
You're putting me through more paces
than the doctors

01:34.135 --> 01:35.053
who approved the transplant.

01:35.178 --> 01:37.764
Well see, I got to make sure whatever goes
into this body is tip-top.

01:37.847 --> 01:38.890
Don't you worry, man.

01:38.973 --> 01:40.683
You're getting one premium kidney.

01:41.184 --> 01:42.477
See this little guy right here?

01:42.852 --> 01:44.479
He's gonna take you
to a whole new level.

01:44.562 --> 01:46.606
-Oh, yeah? Whole new level!
-Whole new level, yes.

01:46.689 --> 01:48.441
-Which level?
-A level you're not ready for.

02:31.609 --> 02:32.610
Okay, gracias.

02:36.823 --> 02:39.868
So which one of you is Batman
and which one is Robin?

02:40.118 --> 02:40.952
-He's Robin.
-He's Robin!

02:41.035 --> 02:43.872
I see how it is. The captain offers
to give you one vital organ,

02:43.955 --> 02:45.665
and now he's riding shotgun for life?

02:45.748 --> 02:48.376
Come on, now, Villa, you'll always
have a seat in the Yellow Queen.

02:48.459 --> 02:49.502
Yeah, in the back.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.296
Of course in the back.
What do you think?

02:51.546 --> 02:52.714
You know, I should drive home.

02:53.131 --> 02:54.132
That would be a negative.

02:54.924 --> 02:56.634
-What do we got?
-A worker I spoke with

02:56.718 --> 02:58.636
called the woman an angel caido.

02:59.095 --> 03:00.096
Fallen angel.

03:00.471 --> 03:02.098
There's no way somebody
put her up there.

03:02.849 --> 03:04.684
She must have fallen
from pretty high up.

03:05.435 --> 03:07.645
Looks like the birds got to her
before we did.

03:14.235 --> 03:15.236
I had a watch like this.

03:16.279 --> 03:18.781
It keeps track of your heart rate,
steps per day.

03:20.408 --> 03:21.576
This could tell us something.

03:21.659 --> 03:23.161
Please tell me this woman was dead

03:23.286 --> 03:24.454
before she hit this tree.

03:24.537 --> 03:27.165
Blood spatter indicates
that she was alive, unfortunately.

03:27.248 --> 03:28.708
Decomp suggests
that she's been up here

03:28.791 --> 03:30.043
for a couple of days, maybe more.

03:30.126 --> 03:32.086
If she fell out of a plane
by accident,

03:32.545 --> 03:34.088
a report would have been filed by now.

03:34.172 --> 03:35.715
Yeah, so we're thinking
she was pushed.

03:35.798 --> 03:36.841
Any idea who she is?

03:37.300 --> 03:39.677
No I.D. in her pocket, just this.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.182
Looks like a bunch of wires.
Copper, maybe.

03:48.394 --> 03:50.188
Hi, Mrs. Norman.

03:50.271 --> 03:51.397
Hey, can I call you back?

03:51.481 --> 03:52.482
I'm in the...

03:54.609 --> 03:55.610
Okay, thanks.

03:56.986 --> 03:58.947
-Everything all right?
-My neighbor just said

03:59.030 --> 04:01.324
she heard some noise
coming from inside my house.

04:01.407 --> 04:02.492
She thinks there's someone in there.

04:02.575 --> 04:05.078
-Well, your mother does live with you.
-No, she and Hornstock

04:05.161 --> 04:06.746
are on a cruise in Puerto Rico...

04:06.829 --> 04:08.122
seven nights, ocean view.

04:08.414 --> 04:09.958
I had to sign off on his vacation time

04:10.041 --> 04:11.668
and hear way too much about how much--

04:11.751 --> 04:13.419
Okay, that's...don't finish
that sentence.

04:13.503 --> 04:15.546
It's either a raccoon or a break in.

04:16.297 --> 04:18.091
Well, go check it out.
All right, be safe.

04:18.508 --> 04:20.134
We'll meet you back at the station.

04:20.218 --> 04:23.012
That burglar's about to find out
he broke into the wrong house.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.264
The wrong house?

04:45.785 --> 04:47.328
Put your hands where I can see them.

04:50.581 --> 04:51.582
Come on, sis!

04:51.958 --> 04:53.584
Six kinds of salsa and no milk?

04:54.002 --> 04:55.086
Ma teach you that?

05:01.718 --> 05:02.760
Beaumont?

05:02.844 --> 05:06.389
I'd like to talk to you about
a very important MCL asset.

05:06.472 --> 05:08.433
Let me guess, the 3-D printer
is on the fritz again.

05:08.516 --> 05:09.726
You know what?
Someone needs to tell Mitchie

05:09.809 --> 05:11.936
to stop printing dinosaur bones.
It's not good.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.689
True, but the printer is fine.
I'm talking about you.

05:14.772 --> 05:18.276
-Basketball? Really?
-You found out about the game?

05:18.359 --> 05:19.861
That's why I just had
to send the captain

05:19.944 --> 05:22.697
nine alkaline juices
to drink throughout the day.

05:22.780 --> 05:25.742
Now, I'd like you to tell me
that he is avoiding pain meds

05:25.825 --> 05:28.244
and he has stopped those
protein shakes, right?

05:28.328 --> 05:29.912
Yes. And yes.

05:29.996 --> 05:31.414
And I understand this is a lot,

05:31.497 --> 05:33.416
but I need you to relax.

05:33.499 --> 05:34.334
This is me relaxed.

05:34.417 --> 05:36.169
And when the only person
who can save your life

05:36.252 --> 05:38.379
is carrying a gun and a badge,

05:38.463 --> 05:40.715
you see, I'd like to lock
that man in a padded room,

05:40.798 --> 05:41.841
feed him organic food,

05:41.924 --> 05:44.385
and make sure that he sleeps
12 hours a day.

05:44.469 --> 05:46.971
-But you can't.
-But I can't, so I send juices.

05:47.805 --> 05:49.891
And I ask questions,
like if Dr. Mitchka

05:49.974 --> 05:52.060
can move up your transplant date.

05:52.643 --> 05:53.644
You called my surgeon?

05:53.728 --> 05:56.647
He was able to find an
opening in two weeks.

05:56.731 --> 06:00.151
Now all you and Slade
have to do is call and confirm.

06:00.234 --> 06:01.694
You don't have to thank me, son.

06:01.778 --> 06:03.821
-Your Jane Doe is here.
-But I...

06:13.373 --> 06:14.665
I'm placing the time of death

06:14.749 --> 06:16.209
at approximately one week ago.

06:16.376 --> 06:17.919
The healing pattern on this burn,

06:18.086 --> 06:19.670
I've never seen anything like it.

06:19.837 --> 06:22.006
Me, neither. But, first,
let's focus on getting the I.D.

06:22.090 --> 06:23.341
Start with the facial reconstruction?

06:23.424 --> 06:26.719
The bone density in our victim's neck,
hips, and pelvis

06:26.803 --> 06:27.929
is extremely low.

06:28.012 --> 06:29.514
Bones get weaker
the less you use them,

06:29.597 --> 06:30.681
so maybe she spent more of her time

06:30.765 --> 06:32.308
-lying down than standing up.
-Exactly.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.102
I'm thinking our lady here
might have been bedridden.

06:34.185 --> 06:35.603
Okay. But the smart watch she had on

06:35.686 --> 06:37.647
was a highly specialized
athletic brand.

06:37.730 --> 06:39.607
The EMPD hasn't been able
to pull data from it.

06:39.690 --> 06:41.526
But why would a bedridden woman

06:41.609 --> 06:42.860
have an expensive fitness watch?

06:42.944 --> 06:43.820
Doesn't add up.

06:43.903 --> 06:46.406
Neither does these sky-high
levels of radiation in her scan,

06:46.489 --> 06:48.574
not unless she worked
at a nuclear plant.

06:48.658 --> 06:52.453
Great. So we have a bedridden
nuclear-plant employee

06:52.537 --> 06:53.704
who likes to work out.

06:53.788 --> 06:55.123
This should be easy.

06:55.206 --> 06:56.958
All right, who wants to meet
our victim?

06:58.918 --> 06:59.919
Oh, my God.

07:00.545 --> 07:01.629
Wait a second.

07:02.630 --> 07:04.799
-That can't be her.
-You know her?

07:05.383 --> 07:06.592
Doesn't everyone?

07:06.676 --> 07:08.469
It's Laura Ann Hill.

07:15.143 --> 07:17.061
So time spent floating in space

07:17.145 --> 07:18.688
would explain her low bone density.

07:18.771 --> 07:20.940
She'd obviously have radiation
exposure from the sun.

07:21.023 --> 07:23.401
And the grueling workout regimen
part of her training.

07:23.484 --> 07:24.735
Which only leaves one question,

07:25.653 --> 07:28.739
how on earth does an astronaut
fall out of the sky?

07:42.378 --> 07:45.047
All of us at NASA are shaken
by what happened.

07:45.673 --> 07:48.009
Mission Specialist Laura Hill
was a critical part of the team.

07:48.092 --> 07:49.844
She's the most determined woman
I've ever met.

07:49.927 --> 07:51.929
She applied seven times
to the astronaut corps

07:52.013 --> 07:53.014
before she was admitted.

07:53.097 --> 07:54.098
Nobody worked harder.

07:54.182 --> 07:55.266
What kind of work did she do?

07:55.349 --> 07:57.059
Her focus was repairing the ISS.

07:57.143 --> 07:58.936
The International Space Station.

07:59.020 --> 08:00.980
She spent thousands of hours in orbit.

08:01.355 --> 08:03.149
Three missions, four space walks.

08:03.232 --> 08:04.650
If she was so important,

08:04.734 --> 08:06.694
why didn't anyone notice
she had gone missing?

08:06.777 --> 08:08.362
Laura had been on leave
for a few weeks,

08:08.446 --> 08:09.489
wasn't due back till tomorrow.

08:09.572 --> 08:10.990
I'm sure someone as driven as Laura

08:11.073 --> 08:13.326
-must have stepped on a few NASA toes.
-Oh, no.

08:13.409 --> 08:14.577
Laura was never like that.

08:14.660 --> 08:15.953
She cared about people too much.

08:16.037 --> 08:17.497
Any idea why she went on leave?

08:17.580 --> 08:19.165
I figured she just needed a break.

08:19.248 --> 08:21.334
Laura practically lived
at our facility.

08:21.417 --> 08:23.085
Honestly, I don't think
she had much of a life

08:23.169 --> 08:24.545
outside the space program.

08:24.629 --> 08:27.256
You said she just fell from the sky?

08:27.340 --> 08:28.466
What? Pushed out of a plane?

08:28.549 --> 08:31.260
Maybe. We're checking Flight Aware
for any flights in airspace

08:31.344 --> 08:32.845
near the orange grove where she fell.

08:32.929 --> 08:34.055
Technically, Captain,

08:34.138 --> 08:35.306
she was found while on leave,

08:35.389 --> 08:36.474
so it's your jurisdiction.

08:36.599 --> 08:38.559
But I want you to know,
you have NASA's full support.

08:38.643 --> 08:40.019
I appreciate that.

08:40.102 --> 08:41.854
Detective Villa
will get you oriented.

08:41.938 --> 08:42.939
Thanks for coming in.

08:48.319 --> 08:49.445
You know, I've been meaning
to ask you,

08:49.529 --> 08:50.738
what's the deal with the mug?

08:50.821 --> 08:53.241
-It's a gift from my first captain.
-Yeah? What did you do?

08:53.324 --> 08:55.660
You deliver a baby, catch a killer?
What did you do?

08:55.743 --> 08:56.786
Well, Rosie,

08:57.119 --> 09:00.248
my first case was a series
of bank robberies

09:00.331 --> 09:01.332
up near Pahokee.

09:01.415 --> 09:03.209
I was questioning a witness
on the boardwalk,

09:03.292 --> 09:04.627
and I got a call from dispatch

09:04.710 --> 09:07.755
that the suspect was seen traveling
north right near my location.

09:07.838 --> 09:09.048
-So what happened?
-Nothing.

09:09.131 --> 09:10.675
I had left the squad car in neutral.

09:10.758 --> 09:13.094
It rolled into the sand,
so I had to radio in for the tow.

09:13.177 --> 09:14.637
The suspect's still at large.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.889
But, you know, I guess
my captain gave me this

09:16.973 --> 09:19.141
to remind me that I was
not the best cop ever.

09:20.309 --> 09:21.310
Yet.

09:22.853 --> 09:25.231
So Marcos was a break in.
You said it was a raccoon.

09:25.314 --> 09:27.567
In my defense, he did rummage
through my cupboards

09:27.650 --> 09:28.734
and polish off my queso.

09:28.818 --> 09:31.529
All right! Little baby bro is back!

09:31.612 --> 09:33.322
-Calm down.
-Calm down? We're talking about

09:33.406 --> 09:36.450
Marcos is back
in the 3-to-the-0-to-the-5!

09:36.534 --> 09:39.120
It's time to celebrate.
Double the Villa, double the fun!

09:39.203 --> 09:40.246
When do I get to meet him?

09:41.038 --> 09:44.667
Rosie, I'll be surprised if he even
unpacks his bags, okay?

09:44.750 --> 09:46.210
He enlisted six years ago,

09:46.294 --> 09:48.379
and we've barely seen each other
since his last tour.

09:48.462 --> 09:51.090
Trust me. He's not the stick around
and hang kind of guy.

09:51.465 --> 09:53.175
So whatever welcome-home parade

09:53.259 --> 09:54.552
you're planning
in your head right now,

09:54.635 --> 09:55.636
Floats, boats, beignets.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.096
-Cancel it.
-You don't like beignets?

09:57.179 --> 09:58.180
Mardi Gras... You've been
to Mardi Gras.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.308
I know you have. Showing your...

10:00.391 --> 10:02.393
Where's the rest of Laura's things?

10:02.727 --> 10:03.811
This is everything.

10:07.315 --> 10:09.650
This may be the most amazing
human being

10:09.734 --> 10:11.068
that we've ever had on our table.

10:11.152 --> 10:13.446
You guys realize this woman
has been to space and back, right?

10:13.529 --> 10:15.615
I didn't know you were
such a space nerd.

10:15.698 --> 10:17.325
She doesn't really
like to talk about it.

10:17.992 --> 10:20.119
Yeah, it was, like,
a painful period in my life

10:20.202 --> 10:21.996
because, like, I was this close.

10:22.913 --> 10:24.165
To being an astronaut?

10:24.624 --> 10:26.042
To going to space camp.

10:26.542 --> 10:27.543
Oh, girl.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.879
You know you get motion sickness
on a Ferris wheel.

10:29.962 --> 10:31.505
Yeah, and they probably frown on that

10:31.589 --> 10:33.799
because astronauts like Laura
have gotta be tough.

10:34.050 --> 10:36.135
Which is why I want
to biopsy this tissue,

10:36.218 --> 10:37.678
because if Laura got burned...

10:37.762 --> 10:39.722
-We need to find out how and when.
-Yeah.

10:39.805 --> 10:41.098
Laura Hill was an American hero.

10:41.682 --> 10:43.309
To die the way she did
is just not right.

10:43.392 --> 10:45.394
Okay, so let's get out
our fine-tooth combs...

10:46.187 --> 10:48.189
just an expression...
and find out who did this to her.

10:48.272 --> 10:49.732
Guys, maybe this can help.

10:52.818 --> 10:55.237
Looks like Laura took
this astronaut diet home with her.

10:56.822 --> 10:57.948
Now, I can get used to that.

10:58.032 --> 11:00.117
Oh, please, Mr. Acai Bowl.

11:00.201 --> 11:01.452
You wouldn't last 24 hours

11:01.535 --> 11:03.329
with those dehydrated noodles
and shakes.

11:03.412 --> 11:04.789
Are you saying
I couldn't hack it in space?

11:04.872 --> 11:06.374
-Rosie, you'd hate space.
-She's right, man.

11:06.582 --> 11:08.292
You can't breathe
without a pocket square.

11:08.376 --> 11:09.919
We all remember what happened
when the good doctor

11:10.002 --> 11:11.754
didn't get his B12 before lunch?

11:11.962 --> 11:13.547
Okay, you guys,
I would be great in space.

11:13.714 --> 11:14.757
My middle name is adventure.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.384
No, your middle name is Darius.

11:16.467 --> 11:17.885
But look, it was a test. You passed.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.846
And you both know I can hack it.

11:20.930 --> 11:22.473
Nothing like
a little rocket science

11:22.556 --> 11:24.266
to remind me how much I hate math.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.395
Here's a little math for you guys.

11:27.478 --> 11:30.106
One shaving kit plus
two pair of men's shoes equals...

11:30.189 --> 11:31.691
Miss Hill had a boyfriend.

11:31.774 --> 11:33.192
I didn't see any pictures.

11:33.275 --> 11:34.485
Maybe he's camera-shy.

11:34.568 --> 11:36.237
Or they didn't want
other people to know.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.989
And looks like Laura missed
an appointment this morning

11:39.073 --> 11:41.325
- with an Evie Hower.
- Go talk to her.

11:41.409 --> 11:42.952
If Laura had a life
outside the space program,

11:43.035 --> 11:45.204
maybe this Evie can tell us
what it was.

11:46.831 --> 11:49.625
So we know Annalise Villa
was her high-school prom queen.

11:49.709 --> 11:50.876
I don't like where this is going.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.254
What was Marcos?
Was he a jock or a nerd?

11:53.963 --> 11:55.214
Maybe a little of both, like me?

11:55.589 --> 11:56.799
Beer or whiskey? Paper or plastic?

11:56.882 --> 11:58.801
Why would I know that,
and why would you care?

11:58.884 --> 12:00.136
I don't know.

12:00.219 --> 12:01.595
Volcano girl never had a shot.

12:04.640 --> 12:05.641
Can I help you?

12:08.728 --> 12:10.187
I knew when she didn't
show up this morning,

12:10.271 --> 12:11.355
something was wrong.

12:11.939 --> 12:13.941
So Laura came to visit
your class every year?

12:14.900 --> 12:16.110
She was their hero.

12:17.111 --> 12:18.779
I don't know
what I'm gonna tell my girls.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.197
How well did you know her?

12:20.990 --> 12:22.700
We grew up together in Topeka,

12:23.367 --> 12:24.618
moved out here for school.

12:24.952 --> 12:27.455
Laura was the kind of friend
who always kept in touch.

12:28.706 --> 12:31.208
Even when she was
in orbit, we'd video-chat.

12:31.292 --> 12:32.710
When was the last time you saw her?

12:33.127 --> 12:34.170
A few months back,

12:34.545 --> 12:36.630
right before her last ISS mission.

12:36.714 --> 12:38.799
Did she mention having
problems with anyone?

12:38.883 --> 12:40.259
Maybe with a pilot?

12:40.342 --> 12:41.802
No, but it was NASA.

12:41.886 --> 12:43.888
They're all pilots or doctors or both.

12:44.221 --> 12:46.348
-Where can we find Laura's boyfriend?
-Boyfriend?

12:47.308 --> 12:48.476
She didn't have one.

12:49.143 --> 12:50.770
Laura was too busy working.

12:50.853 --> 12:51.854
She actually did.

12:52.730 --> 12:53.689
If you two were so close,

12:53.773 --> 12:55.983
I'm surprised you didn't know
about him.

12:56.066 --> 12:56.942
Look, I'm sorry, but

12:57.026 --> 12:59.278
Laura made me promise
not to say anything.

13:00.029 --> 13:01.280
Miss Hower,

13:01.363 --> 13:03.365
I know your girls must look up to you.

13:04.158 --> 13:06.702
Laura was their hero,
but I think you are, too.

13:07.119 --> 13:08.913
And heroes do the right thing.

13:11.749 --> 13:13.083
Rodrigo Vargas.

13:13.167 --> 13:15.711
You know, your Air
Force-trained flight engineer.

13:15.795 --> 13:18.214
Detective, there's no way
he and Laura were...

13:19.006 --> 13:20.007
involved.

13:20.090 --> 13:22.843
NASA has a strict policy against
astronauts dating each other.

13:22.927 --> 13:25.387
Come on, don't you teach your
scientists the laws of attraction?

13:25.471 --> 13:27.473
Two people, tiny space.
I'll draw you a picture.

13:27.556 --> 13:30.017
We're gonna need to bring
Rodrigo in for questioning.

13:30.100 --> 13:32.186
-I'm afraid that won't be possible.
-Why not?

13:33.771 --> 13:36.315
Specialist Hill and I did a mission
together a few years back.

13:37.316 --> 13:39.318
She was good, and I
liked working with her.

13:39.568 --> 13:41.403
You can drop the act, all right.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.197
We all know you were
more than colleagues.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.990
It's all right, Rodrigo.
Finding Laura's killer

13:45.074 --> 13:46.075
is what's important now.

13:46.158 --> 13:47.326
Come on, I get it.

13:47.910 --> 13:49.995
Space is a good place
to fall in love, am I right?

13:53.040 --> 13:54.250
Time's funny in space.

13:55.876 --> 13:58.212
When the sun rises every 92 minutes,

13:58.796 --> 14:00.422
days don't really mean a whole lot.

14:00.673 --> 14:04.218
One night, I found Laura
repairing the IFT tracking satellite.

14:05.761 --> 14:07.847
Just... floating there...

14:09.390 --> 14:10.641
all by herself.

14:11.308 --> 14:13.477
As the sunrise passed across her face,

14:14.311 --> 14:16.021
it was like I saw her
for the first time.

14:18.107 --> 14:19.650
And I realized in that moment...

14:20.234 --> 14:21.944
That you wanted to see
the sun rise on her face

14:22.027 --> 14:23.237
for the rest of your life.

14:23.904 --> 14:25.823
I guess I must have
said something right,

14:26.156 --> 14:27.867
because she fell in love with me, too.

14:29.785 --> 14:32.037
So I soldered a ring out
of some copper wires,

14:33.163 --> 14:35.165
and proposed to her once
we got back to earth.

14:35.249 --> 14:37.167
My man. Romantic and resourceful.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.420
All right, so what did Laura say?

14:39.837 --> 14:41.755
Come on, Villa, no one
could say no to that.

14:41.839 --> 14:43.507
I wanted to get her
an actual ring,

14:43.591 --> 14:45.342
you know, something fancy.

14:45.426 --> 14:47.469
Laura, she just wanted
the one that I had made.

14:49.346 --> 14:51.348
She said nothing on Earth
would compare.

14:53.267 --> 14:55.519
We were supposed to get married
once I got back to Earth.

14:56.353 --> 14:57.688
That's why Laura asked
for the time off.

14:57.771 --> 14:58.772
She was planning her wedding.

14:58.856 --> 15:01.066
-How long has he been up there?
-Two weeks.

15:01.150 --> 15:02.318
Poor guy comes back tomorrow.

15:02.401 --> 15:04.194
Which means he was in space
when Laura was killed.

15:04.278 --> 15:05.529
He's not our guy.

15:05.613 --> 15:07.364
So you got along with Laura.

15:07.448 --> 15:08.741
Do you know anyone who didn't?

15:08.824 --> 15:10.159
I don't have a name,

15:10.242 --> 15:12.870
but when she returned
from her last mission, she was upset.

15:12.953 --> 15:15.164
She said there was no point
dwelling on it, but...

15:15.748 --> 15:17.166
I think something happened up here.

15:18.584 --> 15:19.627
All right, we need to know

15:19.710 --> 15:21.754
what astronauts were
on the ISS with Laura

15:21.837 --> 15:23.380
and all incident reports
during her stay.

15:23.589 --> 15:24.548
You got it.

15:24.632 --> 15:26.425
If Laura had a problem
that started in space,

15:26.508 --> 15:28.719
maybe that's what got
her killed here on Earth.

15:35.601 --> 15:38.270
Tests confirm that the burn
on Laura's hand was electrical.

15:38.354 --> 15:41.398
The current went into this hand
and out through this knee.

15:41.565 --> 15:42.775
Looks like it healed months ago.

15:42.858 --> 15:44.109
She's been in space

15:44.193 --> 15:45.402
for most of the past six months,

15:45.486 --> 15:47.112
so it had to have happened on the ISS.

15:47.196 --> 15:48.280
Okay, get this.

15:48.364 --> 15:50.407
So the morning of October 18,

15:50.699 --> 15:52.201
Laura was supposed to replace

15:52.284 --> 15:54.787
the primary power converter
for one of the solar arrays.

15:54.870 --> 15:56.747
But then her commander, Yuri Cvetko,

15:56.830 --> 15:58.540
reports that he fixed the problem,

15:58.624 --> 15:59.667
which he blamed on Laura.

15:59.750 --> 16:00.834
If Yuri fixed the problem,

16:00.918 --> 16:02.461
then how did Laura get burned?

16:02.544 --> 16:04.254
That's not the only
report that Yuri wrote

16:04.338 --> 16:06.256
to where a woman screwed
up and he saved the day.

16:06.340 --> 16:07.424
If Yuri lied,

16:07.508 --> 16:09.301
maybe Laura got burned
in more ways than one.

16:17.059 --> 16:18.227
Thanks for the coffee, honey,

16:18.560 --> 16:20.187
but I need to get back to my training.

16:20.270 --> 16:21.605
Now, why don't you
get your boss in here

16:21.689 --> 16:22.982
so he and I can talk this out.

16:23.065 --> 16:24.692
In this room, I am the boss.

16:26.485 --> 16:27.695
What do you want to know?

16:27.778 --> 16:28.862
Let's start with

16:28.946 --> 16:32.241
what happened between
you and Laura Hill on the ISS.

16:33.158 --> 16:35.619
Specialist Hill should have never
been in space to begin with.

16:35.703 --> 16:37.705
I get it. A commander
like you has no room

16:37.788 --> 16:38.956
for mistakes up there.

16:39.039 --> 16:42.793
Or even for some woman who
was probably chosen to fill a quota.

16:42.876 --> 16:44.044
Your words, not mine.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.422
Well, why don't you pick some words

16:46.505 --> 16:48.090
to explain how Laura got this?

16:49.008 --> 16:51.427
It's hard to believe
he and Laura were on the same team.

16:51.760 --> 16:54.304
Just goes to show,
sometimes you can't trust people,

16:54.680 --> 16:56.015
even the ones you work with.

16:58.350 --> 16:59.351
Are you all right?

17:00.602 --> 17:01.729
Someone stole my mug.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.106
No. Are you talking about
"The Best Cop Ever" mug?

17:04.189 --> 17:06.400
I mean, what kind of man
takes another man's mug?

17:06.859 --> 17:07.860
Yeah, that's rough.

17:08.360 --> 17:11.321
Losing something that you've had
for such a long time, that's...

17:11.780 --> 17:12.948
Wow.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.783
You were pretty attached
to that thing, huh?

17:19.163 --> 17:21.123
It was you, wasn't it?

17:21.874 --> 17:22.916
You know, organ donors sometimes

17:23.000 --> 17:26.128
experience sadness and
anxiety after transplant.

17:26.211 --> 17:28.213
If you're this upset
after losing a mug,

17:28.297 --> 17:30.090
how are you gonna feel
after losing a kidney?

17:30.174 --> 17:32.342
I don't drink coffee out of my kidney.

17:32.426 --> 17:34.845
Anything I have to say
is already in the report.

17:35.345 --> 17:36.346
Then why do I get the feeling

17:36.430 --> 17:38.807
that the report isn't the whole story?

17:41.685 --> 17:42.686
I'm so sorry.

17:43.812 --> 17:46.273
When you've spent as much
time in zero gravity as I have,

17:46.356 --> 17:47.691
sometimes you forget things don't

17:47.775 --> 17:49.068
just float where you leave them.

17:49.777 --> 17:50.778
He's lying.

17:52.446 --> 17:53.447
I can prove it.

17:55.699 --> 17:57.242
So, Commander, how long
have you been using

17:57.326 --> 18:00.496
the "adjusting to gravity"
excuse for making a mess?

18:00.579 --> 18:01.830
Habits form in 21 days.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.957
I have 312 in space.
I don't need an excuse.

18:04.041 --> 18:05.334
Rosie, what are you doing?

18:05.417 --> 18:07.503
Visual intracranial pressure syndrome.

18:07.795 --> 18:08.962
It can develop in astronauts

18:09.046 --> 18:10.714
during long-duration space flights.

18:10.798 --> 18:13.383
Their eyeballs flatten,
and their vision becomes hit and miss.

18:13.467 --> 18:14.510
But you already knew that.

18:15.135 --> 18:16.470
And eye drops won't help.

18:17.596 --> 18:19.973
Laura got burned
fixing your mistake, didn't she?

18:20.474 --> 18:22.226
She could see just fine,
but you couldn't.

18:23.060 --> 18:27.314
Even if that were true
and she did save my ass,

18:27.940 --> 18:28.941
why would I kill her?

18:29.024 --> 18:32.277
Because if Laura told anyone,
your career would be over.

18:32.361 --> 18:33.362
That's why.

18:34.279 --> 18:36.615
This is the part where you
either give us a confession

18:36.698 --> 18:38.117
or a damn good alibi.

18:39.493 --> 18:40.494
honey.

18:44.164 --> 18:45.499
His alibi checks out.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.376
The day Laura Hill died,

18:47.459 --> 18:49.169
our space cowboy
checked in for a spa day

18:49.253 --> 18:51.296
-at No More Knots.
-Got the deep tissue,

18:51.380 --> 18:52.214
stuck around for the steam room.

18:52.297 --> 18:54.174
-He's not a great tipper.
-No, no surprise there.

18:54.258 --> 18:55.175
He may not have killed her,

18:55.259 --> 18:57.970
but his report sure didn't
help her NASA career.

18:58.053 --> 18:59.763
And if it weren't for that Russian...

19:00.347 --> 19:01.890
Hill could have been
a commander herself.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.809
All right, let Yuri go.

19:03.892 --> 19:05.936
We'll tackle this with fresh eyes
in the morning.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.402
So Ma and your former captain

19:13.485 --> 19:15.404
up all night playing Color Me Badd.

19:15.487 --> 19:17.906
Now I know how you felt when
she seduced your baseball coach.

19:17.990 --> 19:18.907
Yeah, man.

19:18.991 --> 19:21.451
Her and Coach Gonzalez
running the bases all season

19:21.535 --> 19:23.245
and I still can't throw a curveball.

19:25.372 --> 19:26.373
So...

19:27.332 --> 19:28.792
You and this Adrian guy, huh?

19:28.876 --> 19:29.877
Yeah.

19:31.295 --> 19:32.462
I really like him.

19:34.381 --> 19:35.966
-Okay.
-What do you mean, "Okay?"

19:36.466 --> 19:38.218
Okay, like, if you really liked him,

19:38.677 --> 19:40.095
you'd have given him a drawer.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.305
You went through my drawers?

19:41.388 --> 19:43.599
I'm an intelligence officer,
trained to assess

19:43.682 --> 19:45.142
any new environment I enter into.

19:45.934 --> 19:47.811
Plus, the pizza guy
needed some cash, so...

19:48.604 --> 19:49.938
In your sock drawer?

19:50.272 --> 19:51.315
Really, Detective?

19:51.398 --> 19:53.233
Hey, most burglars go
straight to the freezer.

19:53.317 --> 19:54.359
Right.

19:54.443 --> 19:56.111
And you said you bought us dinner.

19:56.695 --> 19:57.946
No, I said I got us dinner.

19:58.697 --> 20:01.033
I sweet-talked the pizza girl
into some extra bread sticks.

20:01.116 --> 20:02.409
You're welcome, by the way.

20:02.492 --> 20:03.493
So,

20:05.662 --> 20:07.873
When exactly did your last tour end?

20:07.956 --> 20:10.459
-I told you. I got back this morning.
-Really?

20:10.876 --> 20:14.129
Because I noticed your
luggage didn't have any tags.

20:15.380 --> 20:16.465
And my sister intuition

20:16.548 --> 20:19.301
told me to put a call
into a friend at Army CID.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.804
You landed four months ago, Marcos.

20:22.888 --> 20:24.640
What's this? An interrogation, sis?

20:24.973 --> 20:26.516
Only if you're hiding something.

20:28.852 --> 20:29.853
All right.

20:30.979 --> 20:32.940
All right, truth is I've been
couch surfing.

20:35.108 --> 20:36.818
It's been a rough landing.
It always is.

20:39.655 --> 20:40.656
How can I help?

20:40.989 --> 20:42.616
You know, when I first enlisted, I...

20:43.533 --> 20:45.994
I wanted to get as far away
from Miami as I could.

20:48.121 --> 20:50.666
I guess I never expected
all the things I was running from

20:50.749 --> 20:52.834
to be waiting for me when I got back.

20:56.964 --> 20:59.091
I'm gonna get us some more beers.

21:05.389 --> 21:06.932
Hey, we've been focused on

21:07.015 --> 21:08.642
what happened to Laura in space,

21:08.725 --> 21:10.686
but what if what got her killed

21:10.769 --> 21:12.980
was waiting for her down
on earth when she got back?

21:13.772 --> 21:15.774
-What's that?
-EMPD techs just recovered

21:15.857 --> 21:17.442
partial health and activity data

21:17.526 --> 21:18.610
from the victim's fit watch.

21:18.694 --> 21:20.946
Well, let's see if we can
retrace her final steps.

21:21.029 --> 21:24.032
Okay. The GPS data points
are fragmented,

21:24.116 --> 21:27.703
but we've got number of steps,
heart rate, and calories burned.

21:28.036 --> 21:31.623
Okay, so on Laura's last
run, she took 6,000 steps,

21:32.124 --> 21:34.459
stopped, but her heart rate spiked.

21:34.543 --> 21:36.169
Well, we need to figure out
where she was

21:36.253 --> 21:37.796
and what made her vitals spike.

21:37.879 --> 21:38.797
Well, we don't have her route.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.299
6,000 steps is about three miles.

21:40.382 --> 21:42.342
Pull up a map
from Laura's neighborhood.

21:42.551 --> 21:44.678
Okay, so a three-mile
jog from her apartment

21:44.761 --> 21:46.680
would take her past a liquor store,

21:46.763 --> 21:49.850
a church, Connie's Kung Pao Chicken.

21:49.933 --> 21:51.018
A place called Nova Fleet.

21:51.101 --> 21:53.645
Nova Fleet?
That's an aerospace company.

21:53.729 --> 21:55.647
That's a great place to
hang out if you're an airplane.

21:55.731 --> 21:58.233
-Then I say we pay them a visit.
-Let's pay them a visit.

21:59.568 --> 22:00.569
Look familiar?

22:01.069 --> 22:02.362
The logo from Laura's iPad.

22:02.904 --> 22:04.906
Detective Villa, Dr. Rosewood.

22:04.990 --> 22:07.075
Jason Hiyashi.
I'm sorry about the pat-down.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.285
We have to take precautions.

22:08.618 --> 22:10.120
I understand you're here
about Laura Hill.

22:10.203 --> 22:11.663
What exactly do you do here?

22:12.247 --> 22:13.457
What you see around you

22:13.540 --> 22:15.751
is the next giant leap
in human space travel.

22:15.834 --> 22:16.960
I think NASA beat you to it.

22:17.044 --> 22:19.296
NASA only sends astronauts into space.

22:19.755 --> 22:20.714
Nova Fleet is developing

22:20.797 --> 22:23.133
safe, refuelable spacecraft
for the public

22:23.467 --> 22:25.010
with all the comforts of a luxury car.

22:25.093 --> 22:27.137
We want everyone to experience
the wonders of space.

22:27.220 --> 22:29.598
Everyone with a couple millions
dollars lying around, right?

22:29.681 --> 22:32.184
Well, the first automobiles
weren't exactly cheap, either.

22:32.267 --> 22:33.185
The thing is this planet

22:33.268 --> 22:36.188
cannot be home to 7.5 billion
of us forever.

22:36.271 --> 22:39.024
We hope with time that Nova Fleet
can help lead us to our next one.

22:39.107 --> 22:40.692
I'm in. You got an extra seat?

22:40.776 --> 22:42.402
I'm sorry.
We sold out in nine minutes.

22:42.778 --> 22:44.154
But tonight, we are unveiling

22:44.237 --> 22:45.989
our new Series One rocket
to the public.

22:47.783 --> 22:49.868
Never thought I'd be
doing it without Laura.

22:49.951 --> 22:52.037
-Laura worked for you?
-Consulted, yeah.

22:52.120 --> 22:53.497
NASA doesn't pay well. We do.

22:53.997 --> 22:56.458
Most of us here have only dreamt
of space. Laura had gone.

22:56.541 --> 22:57.751
Her experience was invaluable.

22:58.085 --> 23:01.088
So in a few years, we'll all be
vacationing on Mars, right?

23:01.171 --> 23:02.381
I know. It sounds impossible.

23:02.839 --> 23:05.300
But great innovation always does.

23:05.967 --> 23:06.968
I'm a visionary.

23:07.594 --> 23:08.595
I make things happen.

23:08.678 --> 23:09.679
I like the confidence.

23:09.763 --> 23:11.390
Mr. Hiyashi, they're ready for you.

23:11.723 --> 23:12.724
Excuse me.

23:15.560 --> 23:16.395
Hey, Pipp, what's up?

23:16.478 --> 23:18.730
I've I.D.'d the white powder
under Laura's fingernail

23:18.814 --> 23:19.940
sodium bicarbonate.

23:20.023 --> 23:22.401
-Baking soda?
-Just like Mom uses in the kitchen.

23:22.776 --> 23:24.111
Or a kid in a science fair.

23:24.444 --> 23:25.737
Our teacher friend lied to us.

23:25.821 --> 23:27.489
Evie saw Laura right before she died.

23:27.572 --> 23:29.950
The school's principal said
Evie took off after lunch.

23:30.033 --> 23:31.159
They have any idea
where she went?

23:31.243 --> 23:33.412
No, but Evie's father
is retired Air Force.

23:33.495 --> 23:35.330
He keeps a plane at Fremont Airfield.

23:36.415 --> 23:37.874
Sorry, only authorized personnel.

23:37.958 --> 23:38.959
What about Evie Hower?

23:39.042 --> 23:41.002
-She's authorized.
-Not to fly a plane, she's not.

23:41.086 --> 23:42.504
-By Captain Hower
-Her father?

23:42.879 --> 23:45.382
Yeah, he probably taught her
how to fly before she could walk.

23:45.465 --> 23:47.259
-But we checked.
-And she's not licensed.

23:47.342 --> 23:50.345
So unless you want us
to file a complaint with the FAA,

23:50.804 --> 23:51.888
tell us where she is.

24:09.614 --> 24:12.409
So you want to tell me why
you lied about seeing Laura,

24:12.617 --> 24:14.911
or skip to the part where you
pushed her out of this plane?

24:20.750 --> 24:23.253
This is crazy.
I would never hurt Laura.

24:23.336 --> 24:24.629
She was one of my oldest friends.

24:24.713 --> 24:26.381
Well, sometimes we hurt
the ones we love.

24:26.465 --> 24:27.549
Was it jealousy?

24:28.049 --> 24:30.010
It must have been hard
seeing Laura become a hero.

24:30.093 --> 24:31.720
No, I was happy for Laura.

24:31.803 --> 24:33.346
Then why did you lie about seeing her?

24:33.972 --> 24:36.308
A couple of weeks ago,
Laura came by the school.

24:36.391 --> 24:37.934
I was setting up for the science fair.

24:38.018 --> 24:39.227
She was about to go on leave.

24:39.311 --> 24:41.354
She told me she was gonna
marry Rodrigo.

24:41.438 --> 24:42.522
They were in love,

24:42.606 --> 24:45.108
and she asked me
to be her maid of honor.

24:45.192 --> 24:47.903
This isn't story time.
Answer the question, why lie?

24:47.986 --> 24:48.987
Why take off?

24:49.738 --> 24:52.199
Because Laura wasn't the only one
in love with Rodrigo...

24:53.492 --> 24:54.618
was she?

24:54.701 --> 24:56.536
You wanted her job and her man?

24:56.620 --> 24:58.038
Love triangles never end well.

24:58.121 --> 24:59.831
No, look, Rodrigo called me.

24:59.915 --> 25:01.208
He said he needed to talk.

25:01.291 --> 25:02.375
I went over there.

25:02.918 --> 25:05.670
He said he suspected Laura
was seeing another guy,

25:05.754 --> 25:07.589
and he thought that I would know who.

25:07.672 --> 25:09.216
And one thing led to another...

25:09.299 --> 25:11.676
-Wait, hold up. You slept with him?
-Wow.

25:11.801 --> 25:13.637
-I did not see that coming.
-Well, it sounds like

25:13.720 --> 25:15.096
our love triangle turned
into a love square.

25:15.180 --> 25:18.016
-I guess math can be interesting.
-Technically, it's geometry.

25:18.099 --> 25:19.976
-Keep talking.
-I don't know how it happened.

25:20.060 --> 25:21.603
It was a mistake. He was hurting.

25:21.686 --> 25:22.938
Who was the guy Laura was seeing?

25:23.021 --> 25:24.439
I don't know if there even was one,

25:24.523 --> 25:25.774
but Rodrigo was convinced.

25:25.857 --> 25:27.901
He said it was some guy
she was working with.

25:27.984 --> 25:30.904
If you expect us to believe
Rodrigo killed Laura, save it.

25:30.987 --> 25:33.031
He was in space, which
is a pretty good alibi.

25:33.114 --> 25:34.908
I wasn't running. I swear.

25:34.991 --> 25:36.576
I just needed to get
away and clear my head.

25:36.660 --> 25:37.827
We're gonna have to search your plane.

25:37.911 --> 25:39.246
If we find traces of Laura,

25:39.329 --> 25:41.623
you'll be grading science
projects from a prison cell.

25:43.583 --> 25:44.584
Everything okay?

25:46.044 --> 25:47.045
I don't know.

25:53.677 --> 25:54.636
Thanks.

25:54.719 --> 25:55.720
I'll take it from here.

25:56.680 --> 25:57.681
Hey,

25:58.098 --> 25:59.391
there she is.

25:59.474 --> 26:01.351
Detective Annalise Villa,

26:01.434 --> 26:02.811
the toughest cop in all of Miami.

26:02.894 --> 26:03.979
What's up, sis?

26:04.062 --> 26:05.772
-You all right?
-No, man.

26:05.855 --> 26:08.817
Three tours in the desert,
and I can't get one drink in Miami.

26:08.900 --> 26:11.486
-You believe that?
-Yeah, it sounds like you had plenty.

26:12.237 --> 26:13.238
Yeah.

26:13.613 --> 26:16.825
Yo, you remember when
Pops used to hustle people

26:16.908 --> 26:17.909
on the tables in there?

26:18.451 --> 26:19.911
I thought it was a dump then.

26:19.995 --> 26:21.079
Man, look at it now.

26:22.622 --> 26:23.665
All right, come on.

26:23.748 --> 26:25.250
Let's sleep this off at home.

26:26.668 --> 26:27.669
Home.

26:28.253 --> 26:30.755
♪ Left my home for the DMZ ♪

26:30.839 --> 26:33.133
♪ Mama can't cook that MRE ♪

26:33.550 --> 26:36.052
♪ Give me tents and my green beret ♪

26:36.970 --> 26:39.347
♪ Soldiers till we're DOA ♪

26:39.431 --> 26:40.932
-All right, come on.
-I'm gonna walk.

26:41.016 --> 26:42.017
I'm gonna walk!

26:58.825 --> 27:00.118
T, if I'm not allowed

27:00.201 --> 27:01.911
to obsess over Beaumont's transplant,

27:01.995 --> 27:03.788
you're not allowed to obsess
over that thing.

27:03.872 --> 27:05.874
Are you kidding me?
These are the actual blueprints

27:05.957 --> 27:07.959
for Nova Fleet's manned
commercial spacecraft.

27:09.294 --> 27:10.712
Give the girl a break, Mom.

27:10.795 --> 27:13.089
That is the closest
that she'll ever get to space.

27:13.923 --> 27:14.924
Hey.

27:15.008 --> 27:16.676
-Hey.
-What's up?

27:16.760 --> 27:17.927
Is there a...

27:18.011 --> 27:20.764
a sibling code for "my
brother's acting weird

27:20.847 --> 27:22.390
but he won't tell me what it's about?"

27:22.474 --> 27:23.642
Girl, no. There's no
sibling code for that.

27:23.725 --> 27:25.602
That's just called everyday life.

27:25.935 --> 27:28.396
-Hey, I got your call. What's up?
-New tox.

27:28.480 --> 27:31.316
Laura's body was covered
with a thin film of Imazalil.

27:31.399 --> 27:33.026
A fungicide used in orange groves,

27:33.109 --> 27:34.444
like the one that Laura was found in.

27:34.527 --> 27:37.197
It can prevent the decay
and decomposition of fruits, plants...

27:37.280 --> 27:38.782
-Or a body.
-Exactly.

27:38.865 --> 27:40.575
We thought that Laura
had been dead for seven days.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.786
We were wrong. She's been dead
for over two weeks.

27:42.869 --> 27:44.954
Two weeks ago,
Rodrigo was on the ground.

27:45.497 --> 27:46.831
So much for his alibi.

27:46.915 --> 27:47.749
Sorry, Doctor.

27:47.832 --> 27:49.542
Rodrigo just landed a few hours ago.

27:49.626 --> 27:51.503
You can't speak with him.
He's being monitored.

27:51.586 --> 27:53.963
-What's wrong with him?
-It takes days to adjust to gravity.

27:54.047 --> 27:55.924
You got to regain balance,
rebuild your strength.

27:56.007 --> 27:57.676
Well, he can use
his mouth to talk, right?

27:57.759 --> 27:59.678
He just became the prime suspect
in Laura's murder.

27:59.761 --> 28:01.721
Okay. So Feldheim looked into Rodrigo.

28:01.805 --> 28:03.973
Turns out a few months ago,
he showed up at Nova Fleet,

28:04.057 --> 28:05.558
demanding to speak with Hiyashi.

28:05.642 --> 28:08.144
Security came, kicked him out,
but no one ever pressed charges.

28:08.228 --> 28:10.772
Sounds like Evie was telling the truth
about Rodrigo's jealousy.

28:10.855 --> 28:12.273
Maybe he thought Hiyashi
was the other man.

28:12.357 --> 28:14.109
Excuse me, sir,
I'm sorry to interrupt.

28:14.192 --> 28:15.360
It's Rodrigo. He's gone.

28:15.443 --> 28:16.945
-Gone? Where did he go?
-I don't know.

28:17.028 --> 28:18.113
He took your Porsche.

28:18.196 --> 28:20.031
What? Excuse me.

28:20.115 --> 28:21.741
So if Rodrigo was mad enough
to kill Laura

28:21.825 --> 28:22.826
because she was cheating,

28:22.909 --> 28:23.868
I bet you he's mad enough to kill

28:23.952 --> 28:25.203
whoever he thought
she was cheating with.

28:25.286 --> 28:27.247
We need to get to Hiyashi
before Rodrigo does.

28:27.330 --> 28:29.791
If not, you could have a second body
on your table.

28:41.594 --> 28:43.722
I already told you. Mr.
Hiyashi is not available.

28:43.805 --> 28:45.598
-Look, the man's in danger.
-Which is what you'll be

28:45.682 --> 28:47.642
if you don't tell us
where he is right now.

28:48.560 --> 28:49.728
Good evening.

28:49.894 --> 28:51.813
And welcome to Nova Fleet.

28:52.856 --> 28:53.690
Throughout history,

28:53.940 --> 28:55.567
humans have reached for the stars.

28:56.109 --> 28:58.361
Now... we can touch them.

28:58.987 --> 28:59.988
I give you...

29:00.864 --> 29:01.990
Series One.

29:10.331 --> 29:11.332
Thank you.

29:20.759 --> 29:21.634
-That's great.
-We need to get you

29:21.718 --> 29:23.386
into protective custody right now,

29:23.470 --> 29:24.721
until we find Rodrigo.

29:24.804 --> 29:26.431
Detective, I don't follow. Why me?

29:26.514 --> 29:27.432
We think he's convinced

29:27.515 --> 29:29.642
that something was going on
between you and Laura,

29:29.726 --> 29:31.936
-that's why he killed her.
-But we were just colleagues.

29:32.020 --> 29:33.480
Look, I appreciate your concern,

29:33.563 --> 29:35.315
but my security
stopped Rodrigo before.

29:35.482 --> 29:37.400
I can't leave. I'm sorry.

29:39.986 --> 29:40.987
We need backup.

29:41.070 --> 29:42.947
I posted Feldheim and
Young at the main door.

29:43.031 --> 29:44.324
Don't leave Hiyashi's side.

29:44.407 --> 29:46.242
I'll work with his team
to secure the other entrances.

29:46.326 --> 29:47.452
I missed the scoop,
if I would have known

29:47.535 --> 29:50.079
we were gonna be on a stakeout,
I would have worn one of my tuxes.

29:50.163 --> 29:51.706
One of them? How many do you have?

29:51.790 --> 29:53.708
Well, you got be ready
for the tails and no tails.

29:53.792 --> 29:55.752
-Rosie, nobody here is wearing a tux.
-Maybe they should.

29:56.085 --> 29:58.630
Listen, this guy is smart,
angry, and jealous...

29:58.713 --> 29:59.547
a bad combo.

29:59.631 --> 30:01.633
We need eyes on him
before he makes his move.

30:01.716 --> 30:02.634
Hold up.

30:02.717 --> 30:04.344
You guys aren't gonna
hook me up with a bud?

30:04.719 --> 30:05.595
Do you even know how to work a bud?

30:05.678 --> 30:07.639
This isn't my first bud, all right?

30:07.722 --> 30:09.307
I was born for the bud.

30:09.557 --> 30:12.393
Our transition
to carbon-wrapped titanium

30:12.477 --> 30:15.313
allowed us to expand the
capacity of each Series One

30:15.396 --> 30:16.606
to 12 passengers.

30:18.066 --> 30:19.150
Entrances are secure.

30:20.276 --> 30:21.194
No sign of him here.

30:21.820 --> 30:22.737
I'll go check outside.

30:23.947 --> 30:24.989
Ten, what's your 20, copy?

30:26.199 --> 30:27.450
Rosie, what are you doing?

30:27.534 --> 30:29.035
Hey, I just want to know, are we using,

30:29.118 --> 30:30.078
like, the traditional lingo

30:30.161 --> 30:31.913
or am I allowed to improvise?

30:31.996 --> 30:33.248
-Rosie...
-I just want to make sure that

30:33.331 --> 30:34.707
we're on the same page, you know.

30:34.791 --> 30:36.376
Those who abuse their buds,

30:36.459 --> 30:38.211
-lose their buds.
-Copy that.

30:38.545 --> 30:40.213
I got eyes on Rodrigo's ride.

30:41.047 --> 30:42.048
Stand by.

30:59.524 --> 31:00.733
Bad news, guys.

31:00.817 --> 31:02.485
I think he's already inside.

31:02.569 --> 31:04.529
Now, remember he's still
recovering from re-entry.

31:04.612 --> 31:06.281
He's sensitive to lights and noises

31:06.364 --> 31:07.407
as his body adjusts.

31:07.490 --> 31:09.784
And he's still unlikely
to be solid on his feet.

31:15.290 --> 31:16.291
Hey.

31:17.876 --> 31:19.377
All of us were saddened

31:19.460 --> 31:22.213
to hear of the loss
of astronaut Laura Hill.

31:22.714 --> 31:24.716
I was privileged enough
to get to know Laura

31:24.799 --> 31:26.259
when she consulted for us.

31:26.342 --> 31:28.011
She was a wonderful woman,

31:28.094 --> 31:31.890
one who shared our dream
of space travel for all.

31:32.515 --> 31:33.683
We will honor her memory.

31:40.398 --> 31:42.358
Give me your gun. Now.

31:43.234 --> 31:44.569
Well, I'm afraid I can't do that,

31:44.652 --> 31:46.821
seeing as how there's a room full
of people here.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.281
It's just not gonna happen, man.

31:49.032 --> 31:50.366
You must be Rodrigo.

31:51.284 --> 31:52.285
Rosie, do you see him?

31:52.368 --> 31:53.995
Gun now, or I slice you open

31:54.078 --> 31:55.455
in front of all these nice people.

31:55.830 --> 31:57.332
-Do me a favor.
-What?

31:57.832 --> 31:59.667
Could you move that blade
two inches to the right?

31:59.751 --> 32:01.628
I'm trying to keep
that kidney warm for a friend.

32:01.711 --> 32:02.962
EMPD, drop it.

32:04.881 --> 32:06.090
Think about what you're doing.

32:06.174 --> 32:07.300
Let us get you some help.

32:08.051 --> 32:09.677
I said drop it.

32:10.678 --> 32:12.639
-What's going on here?
-Laura and I were starting

32:12.722 --> 32:13.723
our lives together.

32:14.057 --> 32:15.183
You took her from me!

32:22.565 --> 32:23.858
You don't look so good, man.

32:23.942 --> 32:25.234
I think you should lie down.

32:29.238 --> 32:30.907
Yeah, that's the power of the bud.

32:33.201 --> 32:34.494
You better get that checked out.

32:44.587 --> 32:45.588
We good?

32:49.342 --> 32:50.510
Cut's not too deep.

32:50.969 --> 32:53.012
Your little guy should be just fine.

32:53.096 --> 32:54.347
I'm just glad you're all right.

32:56.015 --> 32:58.226
You know, you were a preemie,

32:58.309 --> 32:59.310
just like me.

33:00.395 --> 33:02.397
Three pounds, 8 ounces. Why?

33:02.480 --> 33:03.940
I wanted to know everything
about your health,

33:04.065 --> 33:06.484
so I made some calls,
pulled your medical files.

33:06.567 --> 33:07.610
You know, a low birth weight

33:07.694 --> 33:08.987
means that you're at a greater risk for

33:09.070 --> 33:11.322
developing kidney
complications in the future.

33:11.781 --> 33:13.449
That risk increases if you're a donor.

33:13.533 --> 33:15.702
Now, I discussed all that
with my doctor already.

33:16.285 --> 33:17.453
It's an allowable risk.

33:17.537 --> 33:18.579
Well, not for me.

33:20.206 --> 33:22.000
I'm not gonna risk your
life to save my own.

33:26.045 --> 33:27.130
You finally found it.

33:28.631 --> 33:30.341
The basketball, the coffee mug...

33:30.675 --> 33:32.051
that's what all this was about.

33:32.135 --> 33:34.095
No risk to my life
was low enough for you.

33:34.762 --> 33:36.222
You wanted a reason to say no.

33:37.098 --> 33:38.307
I found a pretty good one.

33:38.391 --> 33:39.267
No, you didn't.

33:39.350 --> 33:41.144
Look, I know you're not
the type of guy

33:41.227 --> 33:42.562
that lets people help him.

33:43.146 --> 33:44.313
I get that.

33:44.397 --> 33:45.648
But you need a kidney,

33:45.732 --> 33:46.983
or you're not gonna make it.

33:49.068 --> 33:50.111
I know.

33:51.696 --> 33:52.697
But not like this.

33:59.412 --> 34:00.413
Let me guess.

34:00.496 --> 34:01.748
You're still trying to make
your own spaceship?

34:01.831 --> 34:04.292
Propulsion science can
make a girl feel dumb.

34:04.375 --> 34:05.918
You're the smartest girl I know.

34:06.002 --> 34:07.003
You'll figure it out.

34:07.545 --> 34:08.546
Let me see.

34:09.505 --> 34:11.883
Looks like whatever
space bug TMI caught

34:11.966 --> 34:13.634
just spread to your sister.

34:14.093 --> 34:15.511
I'm just glad they're close again.

34:16.179 --> 34:18.181
Relationships shouldn't
end until they're finished.

34:19.891 --> 34:21.267
Unless they're trying to kill you.

34:25.980 --> 34:27.440
-What?
-The ring.

34:28.316 --> 34:29.484
It was in her pocket.

34:29.984 --> 34:30.985
So?

34:31.069 --> 34:32.236
Laura loved Rodrigo,

34:32.320 --> 34:33.905
so why wasn't she wearing the ring?

34:33.988 --> 34:36.574
If your fiance takes you
up for a romantic flight,

34:36.657 --> 34:37.909
you wear the ring he gave you.

34:37.992 --> 34:42.038
The only reason to put it in your
pocket would be...

34:42.121 --> 34:44.415
-You're not with your fiance.
-Hi, sorry.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.459
I know this is gonna sound crazy,

34:46.876 --> 34:49.420
I know that I'm a little
distracted by Hiyashi's designs...

34:49.921 --> 34:50.755
or, okay, obsessed.

34:50.838 --> 34:52.131
But I missed something.

34:52.215 --> 34:53.216
We all did.

34:53.299 --> 34:55.760
Okay, check the date. Bottom corner.

34:57.303 --> 34:58.638
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

34:58.721 --> 34:59.972
We arrested the wrong guy.

35:05.603 --> 35:06.938
It's beautiful, isn't it?

35:07.814 --> 35:10.316
From the first time
that I saw Saturn's rings as a child,

35:10.399 --> 35:12.485
I wanted to reach up and touch them,

35:13.027 --> 35:14.445
see the sunrise from space.

35:16.155 --> 35:18.407
You know, only a handful
of people in human history

35:18.491 --> 35:19.575
know what that's like.

35:20.451 --> 35:21.536
Laura Hill was one of them.

35:21.953 --> 35:24.288
Rosie heard a seat
opened up on this thing,

35:24.372 --> 35:25.790
insisted we come by.

35:25.873 --> 35:27.834
I'm afraid you heard wrong.
No passengers have dropped out.

35:27.917 --> 35:30.086
Actually, someone
might miss their flight.

35:30.503 --> 35:32.755
We thought the designs
Laura had were yours,

35:32.839 --> 35:35.758
but they were dated two years
before Nova Fleet began.

35:36.008 --> 35:37.552
I don't understand
what you're saying, Detective.

35:37.635 --> 35:39.554
The Series One rocket
isn't your design.

35:39.637 --> 35:41.681
It's hers. Rodrigo was right.

35:41.764 --> 35:44.225
Laura was your partner
in more ways than one.

35:44.308 --> 35:45.560
She wanted credit for her work.

35:45.643 --> 35:48.312
Yeah, but you didn't want to share
your place in the history books.

35:48.855 --> 35:50.148
Does this story have a point?

35:50.231 --> 35:52.817
You know, I thought it was funny you
weren't afraid of Rodrigo tonight.

35:52.900 --> 35:54.068
Now I know why.

35:54.152 --> 35:56.154
You knew there was only
one murderer in the room...

35:57.155 --> 35:58.239
you.

35:58.322 --> 35:59.782
You can't prove that.

35:59.866 --> 36:02.326
I'm a visionary. I make things happen.

36:03.369 --> 36:04.245
Recognize this?

36:04.328 --> 36:06.080
That's the seatbelt
from your helicopter.

36:06.164 --> 36:09.041
And those threads... from
the shirt Laura was wearing

36:09.125 --> 36:10.459
the day she fell out of the sky.

36:10.543 --> 36:11.669
Based on her DNA and prints,

36:11.752 --> 36:12.920
I'd say that wasn't the first time

36:13.004 --> 36:14.964
you took her up
on a little romantic flight.

36:15.047 --> 36:17.008
But you didn't even need
to push her out, did you?

36:17.091 --> 36:19.802
All it took was a broken
belt and a hard left.

36:19.886 --> 36:21.804
Laura's work
is gonna shape our future.

36:23.431 --> 36:25.141
You're just gonna be a footnote
in her story,

36:25.224 --> 36:26.434
not the other way around.

36:26.517 --> 36:27.602
She's the real hero.

36:37.153 --> 36:38.321
Mrs. Rosewood.

36:38.404 --> 36:39.405
Please. Donna.

36:40.198 --> 36:41.282
Is this a good time?

36:41.365 --> 36:42.617
Yeah, of course. Come on in.

36:43.784 --> 36:46.120
You know, I never thanked you
for the juices you sent.

36:46.204 --> 36:47.788
They tasted...

36:48.873 --> 36:49.874
very healthy.

36:49.957 --> 36:51.209
That's the least I can do.

36:51.959 --> 36:54.295
Well, to be honest, I've been so busy

36:54.587 --> 36:58.507
worrying about how
this transplant will go, I...

36:59.467 --> 37:01.219
I never took the time to thank you.

37:02.178 --> 37:04.138
Yeah, well, that's not necessary.

37:04.222 --> 37:05.223
Yes, it is.

37:05.848 --> 37:07.725
You are saving my son's life.

37:08.601 --> 37:12.021
So if there's anything
that I can do to help,

37:12.980 --> 37:14.440
I'm here for you, too.

37:16.692 --> 37:17.693
Almost forgot.

37:17.777 --> 37:19.278
My son asked me to give you this.

37:20.446 --> 37:22.323
He must think very highly of you.

37:27.703 --> 37:28.704
He does.

37:29.413 --> 37:30.414
So do I.

37:32.583 --> 37:33.584
Have a good night.

37:34.919 --> 37:35.920
You too.

37:58.192 --> 38:00.069
That one's my favorite.

38:00.987 --> 38:01.988
That's a satellite.

38:02.655 --> 38:03.656
What?

38:04.532 --> 38:05.908
Okay, never mind.

38:15.251 --> 38:17.378
Slade told me you
turned down his kidney.

38:18.004 --> 38:20.464
So, what's the plan?

38:23.968 --> 38:25.011
You don't have one.

38:26.387 --> 38:28.848
I'll get back on the donor list,
try my luck.

38:30.099 --> 38:31.767
I'm pretty sure you lectured me once

38:31.851 --> 38:33.394
about accepting help from others.

38:35.146 --> 38:36.063
I can't.

38:37.440 --> 38:38.441
I know.

38:41.319 --> 38:42.570
And I'm not worried.

38:43.112 --> 38:45.239
You're gonna be just fine.

38:45.865 --> 38:46.866
I know you are.

38:47.783 --> 38:48.868
So why do I get the feeling

38:48.951 --> 38:51.037
that I'm not the only guy
you're worried about tonight?

38:51.120 --> 38:52.204
When you and I met,

38:53.122 --> 38:55.458
I wasn't the easiest girl
to get to know, was I?

38:56.334 --> 38:58.419
I vaguely remember you
telling me to get lost

38:58.502 --> 38:59.712
like ten times a day.

39:04.717 --> 39:05.718
I'm worried.

39:06.552 --> 39:10.681
Marcos and I are more alike
than I'd like to admit.

39:15.561 --> 39:16.979
You know, it takes just a few hours

39:17.313 --> 39:18.773
to return from space,

39:19.690 --> 39:21.609
but weeks to adjust on Earth.

39:23.277 --> 39:26.906
And when you get back, everything's
a lot heavier than what you remember,

39:28.449 --> 39:29.909
until you get stronger.

39:32.286 --> 39:34.955
No one knows how hard it is
coming home more than you.

39:37.583 --> 39:38.626
You want to help him?

39:40.378 --> 39:41.379
What helped you?

39:55.017 --> 39:55.976
Don't tell me you're leaving.

39:56.060 --> 39:58.020
I just brought home
all your favorite foods.

39:58.771 --> 39:59.772
No, you didn't.

40:01.107 --> 40:02.108
No, I didn't.

40:02.191 --> 40:03.901
Requested an assignment
in the Philippines.

40:04.819 --> 40:05.903
You should come visit me.

40:06.195 --> 40:07.363
I hear the diving's great.

40:09.907 --> 40:11.992
Look, when I came back
to Miami, this...

40:12.576 --> 40:14.537
this place didn't feel
like home for me, either.

40:14.954 --> 40:17.331
I mean, Dad's M.I.A.,

40:17.832 --> 40:19.834
Mom's Mom,

40:19.917 --> 40:21.377
and I felt like an alien.

40:22.211 --> 40:23.212
So I shut down,

40:23.295 --> 40:24.964
and I pushed everyone
I knew out of the way.

40:25.047 --> 40:27.842
-Yes, the Villa family tradition.
-Right.

40:27.925 --> 40:29.135
But then I met

40:29.218 --> 40:31.887
the world's biggest pain in the ass...

40:33.013 --> 40:34.640
who also happens to have...

40:36.058 --> 40:37.143
the biggest heart.

40:39.103 --> 40:40.312
Rosie.

40:40.396 --> 40:43.774
And for some reason
I still don't get...

40:46.235 --> 40:47.611
he wouldn't give up on me.

40:48.779 --> 40:51.115
It looks like you built
a hell of a life for yourself here.

40:52.199 --> 40:53.200
Yeah, well, so can you.

40:53.284 --> 40:54.535
Please, I...

40:56.745 --> 40:58.622
Bro, our family's broken.

41:00.124 --> 41:02.334
And we all act like we don't need
each other, but we do.

41:03.169 --> 41:04.170
I do.

41:05.337 --> 41:06.338
I mean...

41:06.672 --> 41:08.382
I mean, my best friend's gonna die.

41:08.799 --> 41:11.886
I'm scared, and I can't tell him.

41:11.969 --> 41:15.306
So for the first time
in a long time...

41:16.974 --> 41:20.519
I feel...alone.

41:22.021 --> 41:23.689
You're too busy being
strong for everybody else,

41:23.772 --> 41:25.566
you have nobody to be strong for you.

41:27.485 --> 41:28.944
Look, I don't want to hold you back.

41:30.779 --> 41:31.780
But...

41:32.615 --> 41:35.576
I could really use
a brother right now.

41:41.665 --> 41:42.917
Okay.

41:45.377 --> 41:46.378
Okay.

41:51.342 --> 41:52.968
But if anybody plays
Color Me Badd around here,

41:53.052 --> 41:54.178
I'm out.

41:54.261 --> 41:55.846
-Deal?
-That's fair.

42:23.207 --> 42:25.042
-Everything go all right?
-Yeah.

42:26.210 --> 42:27.211
Perfectly.
