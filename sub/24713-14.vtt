19:10.858 --> 19:13.652
YOU'RE STARTING TO REALLY
PISS ME OFF, DAVE.

19:13.652 --> 19:15.863
SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

19:15.863 --> 19:17.614
DESPITE MY WARNING
TO CONCENTRATE ON YOUR WORK,

19:17.614 --> 19:19.241
YOU FAIL TO DO THAT.

19:19.241 --> 19:22.911
NOW, MY GUESS IS THAT
YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF
DESTINED FOR GREATER THINGS.

19:22.911 --> 19:25.289
I WISH YOU LUCK
IN THAT REGARD, I REALLY DO.

19:25.289 --> 19:27.207
BUT IN TRYING TO CONVINCE
OTHERS AND YOURSELF

19:27.207 --> 19:28.917
THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA
BE ANSWERING PHONES

19:28.917 --> 19:31.336
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE,
YOU OVERCOMPENSATE

19:31.336 --> 19:33.297
AND COME ACROSS
LIKE A REAL ASSHOLE.

19:33.297 --> 19:35.674
MAYBE IT'S MORE
OF A PERSONALITY CONFLICT,

19:35.674 --> 19:38.177
'CAUSE I'VE WORKED
IN A LOT OF OTHER COMMANDS --

19:38.177 --> 19:39.303
GOT ALONG
WITH EVERYONE GREAT.

19:39.303 --> 19:41.471
WHERE?
IN THE OLD RECORD SECTION?

19:41.471 --> 19:42.806
THE PISTOL LICENSE BUREAU?

19:42.806 --> 19:45.434
THIS IS A DETECTIVE SQUAD.
WE DO POLICE WORK HERE.

19:45.434 --> 19:48.061
YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE
FOR GETTING INFORMATION TO US

19:48.061 --> 19:49.104
REGARDING SERIOUS BUSINESS.

19:49.104 --> 19:50.564
YEAH, I'M AWARE OF THAT.

19:50.564 --> 19:52.316
AND I BELIEVE I'VE BEEN
GETTING YOU THAT INFORMATION --

19:52.316 --> 19:54.526
THIS TIME IT'S
NOT A DISCUSSION, DAVE.

19:54.526 --> 19:56.445
FROM NOW ON,
UNTIL JOHN GETS BACK,

19:56.445 --> 19:59.531
I WANT THAT COMPUTER PUT AWAY,
I WANT YOUR CELLPHONE OFF,

19:59.531 --> 20:01.909
AND I DON'T WANT YOU
PUMPING THE DETECTIVES

20:01.909 --> 20:03.535
FOR INFORMATION FOR MATERIAL.

20:03.535 --> 20:05.537
YOU DO YOUR JOB
OR HIT THE ROAD.

20:05.537 --> 20:07.539
YOU'RE THE BOSS.

20:07.539 --> 20:08.790
THAT'S RIGHT.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.505
[ INDISTINCT CONVERSATION ]

20:15.505 --> 20:17.090
TERRENCE?

20:17.090 --> 20:18.133
SEE YA.

20:23.847 --> 20:25.182
WE, UH...

20:25.182 --> 20:28.268
TALKED TO MARCUS HODGES.

20:28.268 --> 20:30.187
OKAY.

20:30.187 --> 20:33.190
SAID YOU WERE DOING SECURITY
FOR HIM AT JINXY'S PARTY.

20:33.190 --> 20:34.233
YEAH.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.943
WERE YOU THERE
WHEN JINXY GOT SHOT?

20:35.943 --> 20:37.069
YEAH.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.363
YOU SEE ANYTHING?

20:39.363 --> 20:40.656
NO.

20:40.656 --> 20:43.325
SO YOU'RE STILL ON 18-MONTH
PROBATION, HUH, TERRENCE?

20:43.325 --> 20:44.576
THAT'S RIGHT.

20:44.576 --> 20:46.036
YOU REMEMBER
HOW PROBATION WORKS?

20:46.036 --> 20:47.204
YEAH.

20:47.204 --> 20:48.872
ONE PHONE CALL,
AND YOU'RE FIRED.

20:48.872 --> 20:50.999
WANT TO STAY A COP?
I REALLY DO.

20:50.999 --> 20:53.710
YOU'RE GETTING ONE CHANCE, RIGHT
HERE, TO TELL US WHAT HAPPENED.

20:53.710 --> 20:56.380
YOU HOLD BACK ANYTHING,
AND I'LL FIND OUT IF YOU DO,

20:56.380 --> 20:58.924
THEN I'M MAKING
THAT PHONE CALL.

20:58.924 --> 21:00.509
WHAT HAS MARCUS TOLD YOU?

21:00.509 --> 21:02.636
WE'RE NOT LOOKING
FOR QUESTIONS FROM YOU.

21:02.636 --> 21:04.096
MARCUS WOULD KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.472
WHY?

21:05.472 --> 21:07.849
AS SOON AS I HEARD
THE SHOTS, I TURN,

21:07.849 --> 21:09.977
AND MARCUS IS STANDING
WHERE JINXY DROPPED.

21:09.977 --> 21:11.645
I MEAN, IT WAS A MADHOUSE.

21:11.645 --> 21:13.647
I RAN TOWARD THE SHOTS,

21:13.647 --> 21:15.774
AND I SEE MARCUS AND JINXY'S
BROTHER ADRIAN --

21:15.774 --> 21:17.192
THEY'RE BOTH RUNNING
AFTER THE PERP.

21:17.192 --> 21:18.819
I GOT BOXED IN
AND LOST THEM.

21:18.819 --> 21:21.113
DID YOU TALK TO MARCUS
BEFORE YOU SPLIT?

21:21.113 --> 21:23.156
YEAH. HE TOLD ALL OF US
WORKING SECURITY TO LEAVE,

21:23.156 --> 21:25.993
TOLD US WE WERE NEVER THERE,
THAT HE WOULD HANDLE IT.

21:25.993 --> 21:28.578
DID MARCUS COOK UP A STORY
FOR YOU GUYS TO TELL?

21:28.578 --> 21:31.915
NO. HE JUST SAID THIS
WAS ON HIM AND TO GET LOST.

21:31.915 --> 21:33.917
ALL RIGHT.

21:33.917 --> 21:36.336
IS THERE GONNA BE
A PHONE CALL MADE?

21:36.336 --> 21:37.879
NOT FROM US.

21:52.185 --> 21:53.270
Woman: YEAH?

21:53.270 --> 21:54.604
POLICE. OPEN UP.

21:54.604 --> 21:55.605
WHY?

21:55.605 --> 21:58.108
JUST OPEN THE DOOR.

21:58.108 --> 22:00.152
BETTY ANN CLANCY?

22:00.152 --> 22:01.695
YEAH. WHY?

22:01.695 --> 22:04.406
WE NEED TO COME IN
AND TALK TO YOU.

22:04.406 --> 22:05.741
ABOUT WHAT?

22:05.741 --> 22:07.409
OPEN THE DOOR.

22:07.409 --> 22:10.412
LET ME SEE
YOUR BADGES AGAIN.

22:24.217 --> 22:28.472
WE'RE INVESTIGATING A COMPLAINT
REGARDING LORI BAILEY.

22:28.472 --> 22:29.681
YOU KNOW HER?

22:29.681 --> 22:31.016
MY HUSBAND DOES.

22:34.436 --> 22:36.897
HEY, YOU GOT QUESTIONS
ABOUT LORI, OKAY,

22:36.897 --> 22:39.358
BUT I DIDN'T SAY
YOU COULD SNOOP AROUND.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.443
YOUR HUSBAND'S
DENNIS CLANCY, RIGHT?

22:41.443 --> 22:42.903
YEAH.

22:42.903 --> 22:44.571
HOW DOES YOUR HUSBAND
KNOW LORI?

22:44.571 --> 22:46.907
I'D LIKE TO KNOW
WHAT THE INVESTIGATION IS.

22:46.907 --> 22:49.910
WE'RE CUTTING YOU SOME MAJOR
SLACK, 'CAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE

22:49.910 --> 22:52.871
YOU GOT A SUBSTANCE OR TWO
IN HERE YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T.

22:52.871 --> 22:55.415
SO START MEETING US
HALFWAY.

23:00.379 --> 23:03.423
DENNIS HAS BEEN
SLEEPING WITH HER --

23:03.423 --> 23:06.802
PRETTY MUCH SHACKING UP.
APPARENTLY WITH
YOUR KNOWLEDGE.

23:06.802 --> 23:09.221
IF YOU HAD A COUPLE HOURS,
I COULD TELL YOU WHAT
I'M UP AGAINST,

23:09.221 --> 23:10.555
BUT I DOUBT
YOU'D WANT TO HEAR IT.

23:10.555 --> 23:12.808
DENNIS GOT YOU HOOKED,
HE COPS FOR BOTH OF YOU.

23:12.808 --> 23:14.226
YOU'RE TRYING TO KICK,

23:14.226 --> 23:16.686
BUT MEANWHILE, YOU'RE STUCK
WITH WHAT YOU CAN GET.

23:16.686 --> 23:17.896
BASICALLY.

23:17.896 --> 23:19.606
YOUR HUSBAND HAVE
ANY BIG DEBTS?

23:19.606 --> 23:21.108
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T ASK.

23:21.108 --> 23:23.985
WAS DENNIS INVOLVED IN THIS?
WE DON'T KNOW YET.

23:23.985 --> 23:25.779
Connie: WHERE DOES
DENNIS GET HIS MONEY?

23:25.779 --> 23:27.406
HE WORKING ANYWHERE SINCE
HE STOPPED DJing AT JIMBO'S?

23:27.406 --> 23:29.616
SOME FREELANCE DJ WORK
AT PARTIES,

23:29.616 --> 23:32.160
AND HE'S APPRENTICING NOW
TO BECOME A PIERCING ARTIST.

23:32.160 --> 23:33.495
WHERE?

23:33.495 --> 23:34.871
RED DEVIL TATTOO.

23:34.871 --> 23:36.081
WHO'S HE
APPRENTICE UNDER?

23:36.081 --> 23:38.041
FOSS -- FOSS MILLER.

23:38.041 --> 23:40.877
THEY JUST PIERCE EARS
AND BELLYBUTTONS?

23:40.877 --> 23:43.296
EVERYTHING.

23:43.296 --> 23:45.173
YOU NAME IT.

23:45.173 --> 23:46.216
GOOD FOR YOU.

23:46.216 --> 23:48.593
LAST WEEK, DENNIS
PIERCED MY --

23:48.593 --> 23:50.720
WE GOT IT.

23:50.720 --> 23:52.431
THANKS.

24:05.235 --> 24:07.320
WE'VE BEEN GETTING MORE
INFORMATION, MARCUS.

24:07.320 --> 24:09.573
ANYBODY GIVE UP FURY
AS THE SHOOTER?

24:09.573 --> 24:11.074
NO, BUT THE INFORMATION
WE'RE GETTING

24:11.074 --> 24:12.784
IS THAT YOU WERE THERE
WHEN IT HAPPENED.

24:12.784 --> 24:14.744
NO, I WAS CLOSE BY,
BUT I DIDN'T SEE NOTHING.

24:14.744 --> 24:16.371
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.

24:16.371 --> 24:18.707
DON'T YOU WANT TO HELP ARREST
FURY FOR KILLING YOUR FRIEND?

24:18.707 --> 24:20.417
HELL, YES, I DO,
AND IF I COULD --

24:20.417 --> 24:22.544
ALL RIGHT,
QUIT DICKIN' US AROUND.

24:22.544 --> 24:24.337
YOU KEEP WAITING
TO FIND OUT WHAT WE KNOW

24:24.337 --> 24:25.797
BEFORE YOU TOSS US
ANOTHER CRUMB,

24:25.797 --> 24:27.174
AND IT STOPS NOW!

24:27.174 --> 24:29.509
YOU STAR-STRUCK 'CAUSE
YOU GOT SOME FAMOUS FRIENDS,

24:29.509 --> 24:31.011
SO NOW YOU'RE
THEIR ERRAND BOY?

24:31.011 --> 24:33.388
I'VE BEEN FRIENDS
WITH JINXY AND ADRIAN
A LONG TIME.

24:33.388 --> 24:35.265
A LOT LONGER
THAN I'VE BEEN A COP.

24:35.265 --> 24:36.975
YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT FRIENDS?

24:36.975 --> 24:39.060
YEAH, YOU GOT ONE STANDING
IN FRONT OF YOU

24:39.060 --> 24:40.604
WHO VOUCHED FOR YOU ALL DAY,

24:40.604 --> 24:43.648
AND IT'S THE ONLY REASON YOU'RE
NOT ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS

24:43.648 --> 24:45.192
TO INTERNAL AFFAIRS
RIGHT NOW!

24:45.192 --> 24:46.776
SO YOU SIDING WITH THEM?

24:46.776 --> 24:48.653
YOU TURNING YOUR BACK
ON BEING A COP?

24:54.451 --> 24:56.870
I WAS THERE. I HEAR SHOTS.

24:56.870 --> 24:58.622
I SPIN AROUND,
AND JINXY'S GOING DOWN.

24:58.622 --> 25:00.165
A COUPLE OF SECONDS LATER,

25:00.165 --> 25:02.542
I SEE FURY RUNNING
WITH A GUN IN HIS HANDS,

25:02.542 --> 25:04.503
SO I GO AFTER HIM,
BUT I LOST HIM

25:04.503 --> 25:06.838
'CAUSE I GOT KNOCKED DOWN
BY EVERYBODY SWARMING THE DOOR.

25:06.838 --> 25:08.381
WHY NOT TELL US
THAT EARLIER?

25:08.381 --> 25:10.258
I FIGURED WHOEVER
CAUGHT THE CASE

25:10.258 --> 25:11.801
WOULD FIND OUT
ON THEIR OWN

25:11.801 --> 25:13.720
WITHOUT US
HAVING TO GET INVOLVED.

25:13.720 --> 25:16.056
THERE WAS MORE THAN
A THOUSAND PEOPLE THERE.

25:16.056 --> 25:18.183
I WAS NOT AN EYEWITNESS
TO THE SHOOTING.

25:18.183 --> 25:20.185
I DON'T KNOW.

25:20.185 --> 25:22.979
I'M TELLING YOU NOW.

25:22.979 --> 25:24.272
DID ADRIAN SEE THE SHOOTING?

25:24.272 --> 25:25.774
I DON'T THINK SO,

25:25.774 --> 25:28.527
BUT ADRIAN WAS RUNNING
AFTER FURY WITH ME.
HE HAD A GUN.

25:28.527 --> 25:31.196
HE PULLED IT OUT
AND FIRED A FEW SHOTS AT FURY.

25:31.196 --> 25:32.405
HE'S ON PAROLE.

25:32.405 --> 25:34.241
SO ADRIAN TELLS YOU
TO STAY OUT OF IT

25:34.241 --> 25:36.326
'CAUSE HE FIRED A GUN
AND HE'D GO BACK IN THE JOINT,

25:36.326 --> 25:39.371
OR TO STAY OUT OF IT SO HE
CAN RETALIATE AGAINST FURY?

25:39.371 --> 25:40.789
HE GAVE ME HIS WORD
HE WOULDN'T.

25:40.789 --> 25:42.499
SO ADRIAN'S
TELLING YOU WHAT TO DO?

25:42.499 --> 25:43.833
I LET HIM DOWN, MAN.

25:43.833 --> 25:45.877
THEY HIRED ME
TO KEEP THINGS COOL,

25:45.877 --> 25:49.673
AND JINXY ENDS UP
GETTING KILLED IN FRONT OF ME.

25:49.673 --> 25:51.967
I COULD BARELY LOOK ADRIAN
IN THE EYE.

25:51.967 --> 25:53.009
ALL RIGHT.

25:53.009 --> 25:55.011
SINCE FURY IS
LAWYERED UP NOW,

25:55.011 --> 25:57.722
I'LL TRY AND GET THE D.A.
TO AUTHORIZE ARREST

25:57.722 --> 25:58.890
ON THE GUN CHARGE.

26:00.976 --> 26:03.144
THAT'S IT.
THAT'S EVERYTHING, JOHN.

26:16.241 --> 26:17.909
HOW YOU DOIN', LADIES?

26:17.909 --> 26:19.578
WE'RE GOOD.
YOU FOSS?

26:19.578 --> 26:20.912
I'M FOSS.

26:20.912 --> 26:23.582
YOU HAVE A DENNIS CLANCY
WORKING FOR YOU?

26:23.582 --> 26:25.542
WORKIN' FOR ME?
OFF AND ON.

26:25.542 --> 26:26.710
IT'S MORE, HE JUST HANGS OUT.

26:26.710 --> 26:28.378
YOU KNOW A LORI BAILEY?

26:28.378 --> 26:30.005
NO. SOMETHING WRONG HERE?

26:30.005 --> 26:31.006
CRAZIEST THING HAPPENED--

26:31.006 --> 26:32.549
WE GOT A COMPLAINT
FROM SOMEONE

26:32.549 --> 26:35.260
WHO WAS TRYING TO GET
A PIERCING THROUGH THEIR HAND.

26:35.260 --> 26:37.804
IT GOT ALL SCREWED UP, BUT
THE COMPLAINT MENTIONED DENNIS

26:37.804 --> 26:39.472
AS THE GUY WHO DID
THE PIERCING.

26:39.472 --> 26:40.807
THAT IDIOT.

26:40.807 --> 26:42.142
DID IT HAPPEN HERE?

26:42.142 --> 26:43.810
HELL, NO.
THIS IS A LEGITIMATE SHOP.

26:43.810 --> 26:46.271
DID YOU TEACH DENNIS
HOW TO PIERCE A HAND?

26:46.271 --> 26:47.606
IS THAT WHAT HE'S SAYING?

26:47.606 --> 26:48.898
DID YOU?

26:48.898 --> 26:50.191
ALL RIGHT.

26:50.191 --> 26:52.444
DENNIS WAS ASKING ME
HOW I WOULD DO IT.

26:52.444 --> 26:55.238
I TELL HIM IT'S DAMN NEAR
IMPOSSIBLE AND DANGEROUS.

26:55.238 --> 26:57.198
HE KEEPS ON ME --
"WHAT IF YOU HAD TO?"

26:57.198 --> 26:59.784
SO I TOLD HIM, "IF SOMEONE
HAD A GUN TO MY HEAD,

26:59.784 --> 27:01.828
"I'D DO IT BETWEEN THE MIDDLE
AND FOREFINGER,

27:01.828 --> 27:03.246
JUST ABOVE THE KNUCKLES."

27:03.246 --> 27:05.707
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT IT
TO JUST KILL TIME.

27:05.707 --> 27:07.542
I THOUGHT WE WERE
KILLING TIME.

27:07.542 --> 27:09.377
HE MENTION HE WAS
PLANNING ON DOING IT?

27:09.377 --> 27:11.755
NO, NOT TO ME.
YOU HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH THIS, FOSS?

27:11.755 --> 27:13.506
'CAUSE THE OTHER SHOE'S
DROPPING, HERE.

27:13.506 --> 27:15.258
NOW WOULD BE THE TIME
TO TELL US.

27:15.258 --> 27:17.469
NO. AND DENNIS
IS AN IDIOT FOR TRYING.

27:17.469 --> 27:18.928
IF YOU SEE HIM BEFORE ME,

27:18.928 --> 27:21.806
TELL HIM NOT TO
COME AROUND HERE AGAIN.

27:24.601 --> 27:27.604
SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY?
WHILE WE'RE HERE...

27:27.604 --> 27:29.105
NOT IN THIS LIFETIME.

27:32.442 --> 27:35.111
WE HAVE AN EYEWITNESS
WHO PUTS A GUN ON FURY

27:35.111 --> 27:36.571
RIGHT AFTER HE
HEARD SHOTS FIRED.

27:36.571 --> 27:38.657
BUT NO EYEWITNESS WHO SEES
FURY SHOOT THE DOA?

27:38.657 --> 27:39.908
NO.

27:39.908 --> 27:41.368
AND FURY'S LAWYERED UP.

27:41.368 --> 27:44.579
WE NEED YOU TO AUTHORIZE THE
ARREST ON A WEAPONS CHARGE.

27:44.579 --> 27:45.997
WE'LL TAKE IT FROM THERE.

27:45.997 --> 27:48.166
I HAVE TO RUN IT
BY MY BUREAU CHIEF.

27:48.166 --> 27:49.501
THEN RUN IT.

27:49.501 --> 27:51.044
WHO'S THE WITNESS?
A COP...

27:51.044 --> 27:53.004
GREAT.
WHO'S WORKING SECURITY
OFF THE BOOKS

27:53.004 --> 27:55.048
AND WHO WE'D LIKE
TO LEAVE OUT OF IT.

27:55.048 --> 27:58.385
I'LL JUST TELL MY BOSS
YOU HAVE A RELIABLE WITNESS.

27:58.385 --> 27:59.594
SOONER THAN LATER.

27:59.594 --> 28:00.845
I KNOW.

28:09.312 --> 28:10.313
HEY.

28:10.313 --> 28:11.773
HOW YOU DOIN'?
