Uh, they... they're a little
worried about you, Emma.

14:00.696 --> 14:03.274
T-They thought it might be
easier for you to talk to...

14:04.667 --> 14:06.148
Eh... sorry.

14:06.173 --> 14:09.346
I didn't mean that like I
was, like, anti... cricket.

14:09.371 --> 14:10.837
I just...

14:11.114 --> 14:13.014
I'm not really in the
mood for therapy right now.

14:13.083 --> 14:16.151
And I've found, usually, that's
when people need it the most.

14:17.554 --> 14:21.823
You've been fighting bad guys
for years without a break.

14:21.892 --> 14:23.224
When I met you all those years ago,

14:23.360 --> 14:25.160
you had nothing but walls
around you to protect you.

14:25.228 --> 14:29.630
But since then, with Henry
and your family and Hook,

14:29.655 --> 14:30.988
those walls are down.

14:31.268 --> 14:33.044
- Isn't that a <i> good</i> thing?
- Of course it is.

14:33.069 --> 14:35.036
But it also let in all
the collateral damage

14:35.061 --> 14:36.327
of all that fighting.

14:38.775 --> 14:40.375
Great. Then how do I fix that?

14:40.477 --> 14:42.010
With time...

14:42.078 --> 14:43.545
and... and some hard work.

14:43.613 --> 14:45.459
Can't you, like, give
me a pill or something?

14:45.484 --> 14:48.739
When it comes to fixing
our biggest problems...

14:48.764 --> 14:51.064
Emma, there are no shortcuts.

14:55.025 --> 14:57.425
[Clicking]

15:02.032 --> 15:04.680
So, you've taken me up on my offer.

15:04.705 --> 15:06.872
Smart girl.

15:07.353 --> 15:09.587
Keep calling me "Girl" and
see how that works out for you.

15:09.656 --> 15:11.889
- [Chains rattle]
- Why don't you take these off of me

15:11.958 --> 15:14.625
and see how that works
out for <i> you?</i>

15:14.694 --> 15:17.328
You said you knew
what was wrong with me.

15:17.430 --> 15:18.362
Prove it.

15:18.464 --> 15:20.698
Emma.

15:20.767 --> 15:23.100
You were a prisoner once.
You know how this works.

15:24.237 --> 15:25.436
What makes you think I was in prison?

15:25.505 --> 15:27.371
I was a warden.

15:27.473 --> 15:30.208
I know that caged look.

15:30.276 --> 15:32.243
That's a look that doesn't quite fade.

15:32.312 --> 15:34.445
So you must know that prisoners respond

15:34.547 --> 15:37.539
to carrots and sticks,
and you brought neither.

15:37.564 --> 15:40.965
Next time, try a bottle
of Syrah and two glasses.

you were just leaving.

You're right.

16:08.948 --> 16:10.882
I <i> was</i> in prison.

16:12.518 --> 16:15.353
The worst part about
it was the loneliness.

16:15.421 --> 16:16.654
It sucked.

16:18.691 --> 16:21.392
Especially for a guy like
you, who likes to talk so much.

16:21.494 --> 16:23.529
[Chuckles softly]

16:23.554 --> 16:27.899
So, you can either
tell me what you know...

16:28.001 --> 16:29.200
or I'll walk out of here,

16:29.302 --> 16:32.003
and I will not come back with wine.

16:32.105 --> 16:34.272
I just won't come back.

16:34.340 --> 16:36.707
<i>Nobody</i> will.

16:41.848 --> 16:44.081
You can just sit here in silence,

16:44.183 --> 16:46.050

16:48.288 --> 16:50.254
rot.

16:50.323 --> 16:52.490
So you <i> did</i> come with a stick after all.

16:52.558 --> 16:55.092

17:12.211 --> 17:14.444
I brought someone who
can help fix your problem.

17:14.547 --> 17:18.214
If you want to find them,
just follow the red bird.

17:18.318 --> 17:19.650
The red bird?

17:19.752 --> 17:21.519
The question is, are you truly ready

17:21.621 --> 17:24.655
to face your own story, Savior?

17:24.757 --> 17:26.757

Ah. Here we are.

Why would Belle want to
dream about this place?

17:44.777 --> 17:46.577
Usually, our dreams pick <i> us,</i>

17:46.679 --> 17:48.412

[Gasps] Rumplestiltskin.

18:02.521 --> 18:05.930
I-I didn't think you'd be
back from your journey so soon.

18:05.999 --> 18:09.734
Uh, don't be angry, but I
don't have the tea prepared.

18:09.802 --> 18:12.536
I-I can have some ready in no time.

18:15.208 --> 18:16.440
Let her go.

18:17.083 --> 18:19.110
She's lost in the dream.

18:19.212 --> 18:21.467
In her mind, she's still a servant,

18:21.492 --> 18:23.226
and you're still a beast.

18:23.772 --> 18:25.038
It's fascinating, isn't it...

18:25.138 --> 18:26.851
to learn how people really see you?

18:26.986 --> 18:29.086
It doesn't matter.

18:29.188 --> 18:30.988
I'll find a way to wake her.

18:31.057 --> 18:34.225
I'm afraid time is a
luxury you do not have.

18:35.528 --> 18:37.461
The sands that allow
passage to Belle's dream

18:37.563 --> 18:39.196
will not last forever.

18:39.298 --> 18:41.132
If you do not wake
Belle within one hour,

18:41.234 --> 18:44.301
she will return to the red
room of the sleeping curse...

18:44.370 --> 18:46.404
a most horrid, fiery fate.

18:46.506 --> 18:49.774
And this time, she will
remain there forever.

18:49.876 --> 18:51.542
So I would hurry
up, if I were you...

18:51.644 --> 18:53.044
if you love her.

18:53.069 --> 18:55.636
Of course I love her!

18:55.815 --> 18:58.049
That's how I'm gonna
get her out of here.

19:00.386 --> 19:02.820
I'll make her fall
in love with me again.

19:05.921 --> 19:08.362
Look, I know my castle
wasn't exactly cheery,

19:08.430 --> 19:09.930
but it was never like this.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.032
To Belle, it was.

19:11.134 --> 19:13.301
This castle terrified her.

19:13.370 --> 19:15.536
So in her dream, it's
become a terrifying place.

19:15.605 --> 19:18.579
It's also the place
where we fell in love.

19:18.604 --> 19:20.337

re-create that moment...

19:20.510 --> 19:23.378
It would just be some cruel trick.

19:24.581 --> 19:25.980
Are you willing to lie to her?

19:27.450 --> 19:29.817
It may be a trick,

19:29.842 --> 19:33.077
but my love for Belle is true.
