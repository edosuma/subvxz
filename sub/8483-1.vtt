23:25.037 --> 23:26.673
BIT HARSH, ISN'T IT?

23:26.673 --> 23:29.842
COFFEE.
NO. THANKS.

23:29.842 --> 23:32.445
NO. YOU'RE RIGHT. HE'S LETHAL.
I'M GONNA GIVE HIM "FAIR."

23:32.445 --> 23:34.447
I DON'T WANT TO GO
ANY LOWER THAN THAT.

23:34.447 --> 23:36.449
AND, UM, MITZA?

23:36.449 --> 23:37.750
THE NURSES LIKE HIM.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.151
YEAH, HE'S GOOD,
ISN'T HE?

23:39.151 --> 23:42.622
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT GOOD,
BUT HE'S EXTREMELY SEXY.

23:42.622 --> 23:46.358
RIGHT. WELL,
HE WAS ON "GOOD."

23:46.358 --> 23:49.028
NOW, SADLY, HE'S
ON "UNSATISFACTORY."

FBI AGENT HARE.

23:56.769 --> 23:59.672
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

23:59.672 --> 24:02.542
FIRST OF ALL, THIS
HAS TO BE ON THE Q.T.

24:02.542 --> 24:04.511
THAT SOMETHING
YOU CAN HANDLE?

24:04.511 --> 24:06.546
SURE. NO PROBLEM.

24:08.515 --> 24:11.450
YOU SEE THIS
GENTLEMAN AROUND?

24:11.450 --> 24:12.719
HIS NAME
IS TEDDY DOLSON.

24:12.719 --> 24:16.789
JEEZ...
I DON'T KNOW.

24:18.691 --> 24:21.193
I MEAN,
TAKE A LOOK.

24:22.862 --> 24:27.299
I COULD PUT THE PICTURE UP,
ASK AROUND,

24:27.299 --> 24:28.467
SEE IF ANYBODY'S
SEEN HIM.

24:28.467 --> 24:31.103
Hare: NO. THAT COULD
BE VERY DAMAGING.

24:31.103 --> 24:33.573
MIND IF I LOOK AROUND?

24:33.573 --> 24:37.143
YEAH, SURE.
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

24:41.280 --> 24:43.683
HOW DO YOU KNOW
ALL THIS?

24:43.683 --> 24:45.084
I CAN'T EVEN PUT FACES
TO ALL THESE NAMES.

24:45.084 --> 24:48.120
I TALK TO PEOPLE, I SUPPOSE.
PLUS, I SEE THEIR FILES.

24:48.120 --> 24:51.057

24:51.057 --> 24:53.425

YOU SEEN MINE?

24:57.363 --> 24:59.498
YOU JUST GOT
YOUR FELLOWSHIP.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.534
IN 2 MONTHS
YOU'LL BE AT N.Y.U.

25:01.534 --> 25:03.770

TO ANY OF US, RIGHT?

25:03.770 --> 25:07.473
YEAH. DEAD RIGHT ON BOTH
COUNTS. ANYTHING ELSE?

25:07.473 --> 25:10.076
IT SAYS YOUR DAD'S A DOCTOR.

25:10.076 --> 25:10.977
RIGHT.

25:10.977 --> 25:13.680
WAS, ACTUALLY.
HE RETIRED.

25:13.680 --> 25:17.383
IS THAT THE SAME
WITH YOUR FAMILY?

25:17.383 --> 25:18.585
ARE THEY MEDICAL?

25:18.585 --> 25:21.087
NOT REALLY. JUST
A LOT OF HYPOCHONDRIACS.

25:21.087 --> 25:23.890
BUT I GUESS THAT'S
NOT QUITE THE SAME THING.

25:28.828 --> 25:29.962
SO DID THE FILE SAY

25:29.962 --> 25:31.798
THAT MY DAD
HAD HIS LICENSE REVOKED?

25:31.798 --> 25:35.501
I'M SORRY.
I'M SUCH AN IDIOT. I'M SOR--

25:35.501 --> 25:37.236
NO, THAT'S FINE.
THAT'S FINE.

25:37.236 --> 25:38.671
I'M SORRY.

25:42.575 --> 25:45.444
WELL, I'LL PUT YOU
OUT OF YOUR MISERY.

25:45.444 --> 25:48.247
HE, UM...

25:48.247 --> 25:51.818
WELL, THAT IS EXACTLY
WHAT HE DID, IN FACT,

25:51.818 --> 25:53.820
FOR A VERY OLD FRIEND
IN A LOT OF PAIN

25:53.820 --> 25:55.788
WITH TERMINAL
LYMPH CANCER.

25:59.158 --> 26:01.093
SO WHERE DO YOU STAND
ON THAT ONE?

26:01.093 --> 26:04.063
I DON'T KNOW.

26:04.063 --> 26:07.299
OH.

26:07.299 --> 26:09.736
NOR DO I.

26:10.970 --> 26:14.140
SO, CAN I GET YOU

26:14.140 --> 26:15.808
OH, NO, THANK YOU.

26:15.808 --> 26:17.209
I'M SORRY.
MAYBE NEXT TIME

26:17.209 --> 26:19.646
WE CAN GO SOMEWHERE
WITH BETTER FOOD.

26:19.646 --> 26:22.448
THAT WOULD BE
ANYWHERE IN NEW YORK.

26:22.448 --> 26:24.684
YES, IT WOULD.

26:24.684 --> 26:26.418
WE SHOULD
PROBABLY GO, RIGHT?

26:26.418 --> 26:28.587
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

26:28.587 --> 26:31.691
LISTEN, YOU GO.
I'LL CLEAR ALL THIS UP.

27:16.402 --> 27:19.438
IT'S WAS, I'M AFRAID.
HE DIED.

27:19.438 --> 27:21.373
TELL ME
HE HAD INSURANCE.

27:21.373 --> 27:23.943
THAT'S NOT AT ALL LIKELY.

INTO YOUR HEAD.

FOR THIS SHIT!

27:45.531 --> 27:47.166

27:57.009 --> 27:59.611
HE'S HIV-NEGATIVE,
BUT LOOK AT HIS T-CELL COUNT.

27:59.611 --> 28:01.613
HE'S NEGATIVE VIRAL
AND BACTERIAL--

28:01.613 --> 28:03.649
WHAT IS THAT?

28:03.649 --> 28:05.718

JUST GOT HER BILL.

28:05.718 --> 28:08.755

I REALIZE IT IS VERY LATE.

28:27.606 --> 28:28.941
I APOLOGIZE.

28:28.941 --> 28:30.943
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD
ANSWER ME ONE THING.

28:30.943 --> 28:35.381
DOES YOUR HOSPITAL USE
A SILVER COLORED BRACELET?

28:35.381 --> 28:38.417
OK, TERRIFIC.
AND YOU DON'T KNOW ANYONE WHO--

28:38.417 --> 28:42.621
ANY HOSPITAL THAT DOES
USE SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

28:42.621 --> 28:47.159
THANK YOU. I APOLOGIZE AGAIN.

THAT'S IT?

29:21.527 --> 29:25.998
THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE?
JUST PULMONARY EMBOLISM?

29:25.998 --> 29:29.401
IT'S JUST THAT HE'D
OBVIOUSLY BEEN IN HOSPITAL.

29:29.401 --> 29:32.604

AS A SYMPTOM--

29:32.604 --> 29:33.873

TO GO. I UNDERSTAND.

29:46.919 --> 29:48.287
WE'RE COMIN' THROUGH!

29:48.287 --> 29:50.890
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR CALLING BACK.

30:01.200 --> 30:02.869
DID HE BITE?

30:04.170 --> 30:08.841
ONE DOWN, ONE TO GO.
HOW ARE WE DOING ON DOLSON?

30:08.841 --> 30:12.011
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH

FOR A BODY BY NOW, BUT, UH...

30:26.558 --> 30:30.997
NO. HE'S STILL ALIVE.

30:32.431 --> 30:37.269
HE'LL BE NEEDING MEDICATION.
I'LL MAKE OUT A LIST.

PERHAPS YOU'RE MISTAKEN?

31:04.496 --> 31:07.633
UM, I DON'T REALLY SEE
HOW THAT'S POSSIBLE.

31:07.633 --> 31:09.035
WITH WHOM DID YOU SPEAK?

31:09.035 --> 31:10.402
I DIDN'T GET A NAME.

31:10.402 --> 31:12.939
SOMEONE HERE. WHOEVER
VERY KINDLY CALLED ME BACK.

31:12.939 --> 31:14.840
AT 1:00
IN THE MORNING?

31:14.840 --> 31:15.908

31:15.908 --> 31:17.743
GAVE YOU
A CAUSE OF DEATH? RIGHT.

31:17.743 --> 31:19.011
WHICH YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE.

31:19.011 --> 31:21.747
IT DIDN'T MAKE SENSE.
THAT'S ALL.

31:21.747 --> 31:24.283
YES, I CAN SEE THAT.

31:24.283 --> 31:27.386
I HAVE NO RECORD
OF THIS MAN.

31:27.386 --> 31:29.922
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?
I THINK, IN FACT, YOU HAVE.

31:29.922 --> 31:32.024

JUST TAKE ANOTHER LOOK.

IN CHARGE HERE, THEN?

31:44.870 --> 31:46.238
THAT WOULD BE ME.

31:46.238 --> 31:47.239
I'VE BEEN HERE
SINCE MIDNIGHT,

31:47.239 --> 31:49.875
AND I MADE
NO SUCH CALLS.

31:49.875 --> 31:54.646
OK, SO, UM, LET ME
JUST GET THIS STRAIGHT.

31:54.646 --> 31:56.448
A--NO ONE PHONED ME,

31:56.448 --> 31:58.384
SO I SUPPOSE THAT WAS JUST
MY IMAGINATION RUNNING RIOT.

A CREEPY PERSON, AREN'T YOU?

32:19.038 --> 32:21.073
YOU SEE, BEFORE
I WAS THINKING

32:21.073 --> 32:22.608
YOU WERE JUST
OBSTRUCTIVE OR INEPT,

32:22.608 --> 32:25.644
BUT NOW I THINK MAYBE YOU'RE
MUCH MORE SINISTER THAN THAT.

32:25.644 --> 32:28.314
I THINK YOU BETTER LEAVE.

I MIGHT HAVE BEEN
MILDLY SARCASTIC,

32:52.104 --> 32:53.505
BUT UNDER
THE CIRCUMSTANCES,

32:53.505 --> 32:55.074
I'D SAY I WAS
ASTONISHINGLY RESTRAINED.

FROM ONE OF THE ORDERLIES.

THEY HAVE NO RECEIPT.

33:14.126 --> 33:15.727
THEN WHO CALLED ME?

33:15.727 --> 33:17.729
WHO? GIVE ME A NAME.

33:17.729 --> 33:19.131
[BEEPER BEEPING]

33:19.131 --> 33:21.233

I WAS BUSY.

33:21.233 --> 33:23.502
YOU DON'T THINK THIS
SOUNDS A LITTLE STRANGE?

33:23.502 --> 33:26.205
A LITTLE STRANGE?
IT SOUNDS A LOT STRANGE.

33:26.205 --> 33:29.441

OR BE ABUSIVE TO ANYONE.

33:29.441 --> 33:31.577
THEN MY APOLOGY
WAS UNNECESSARY.

33:31.577 --> 33:33.145

HAS TO BE CONNECTED.

A METABOLIC MELTDOWN.

33:36.982 --> 33:38.317
HE HAD A TOTAL FAILURE
IN EVERY SYSTEM.

LIKE THAT BEFORE?

IS OUR LAB
