01:04.456 --> 01:05.858
911, what's your emergency?

01:05.892 --> 01:08.360
My husband, something's wrong,
he's not listening to me.

01:08.393 --> 01:10.262
All right, ma'am,
I need you to remain calm.

01:10.295 --> 01:11.931
Can you tell me what's wrong
with your husband?

01:11.964 --> 01:13.432
He's not talking or listening,

01:13.465 --> 01:14.901
he just keeps walking
into the forest.

01:14.934 --> 01:16.669
Does he have any history
of sleepwalking?

01:16.703 --> 01:18.336
No, he never does this.

01:18.370 --> 01:19.806
All right,
I need you to stay calm.

01:22.574 --> 01:24.509
911, please state
your emergency.

01:24.543 --> 01:26.378
I don't know
what the fuck is going on,

01:26.411 --> 01:28.280
but you're gonna need
to send somebody out here quick

01:28.313 --> 01:29.614
to see this shit.

01:31.349 --> 01:32.551
911.

01:32.584 --> 01:35.655
I think someone
is talking to me.

01:35.688 --> 01:37.589
I hear a voice.

01:37.622 --> 01:40.358
Ma'am, is there somebody
there with you?

01:40.392 --> 01:41.661
No, there's nobody.

01:41.694 --> 01:42.929
There's nobody here.

01:45.898 --> 01:48.500
Uh, I'm trapped in my room.

01:48.533 --> 01:50.870
There's something
blocking my door.

01:50.903 --> 01:52.805
Sir, can you describe it?

01:52.839 --> 01:55.775
Um, no.

01:55.808 --> 01:57.309
I can't.

01:58.745 --> 02:00.278
How many of them are there?

02:00.312 --> 02:03.015
Uh, like six or seven of them.

02:03.049 --> 02:04.751
What are they doing now?

02:04.784 --> 02:08.353
They're just standing there
staring at it.

02:08.386 --> 02:09.722
Should I get my gun?

02:09.756 --> 02:11.858
No, sir, don't do that.

02:49.829 --> 02:51.596
Let's go.

02:51.631 --> 02:53.565
Make sure all your phones
are turned off

02:53.598 --> 02:56.501
and not on silent, thank you.

02:56.535 --> 02:57.837
Come on.

03:11.884 --> 03:14.386
All right, guys.

03:14.419 --> 03:17.489
Your time starts now, one hour.

03:36.042 --> 03:38.110
Hey, I need to go
to the bathroom.

03:38.144 --> 03:39.946
No, you don't, Jake.

03:53.592 --> 03:55.161
Hey.

03:55.194 --> 03:57.630
That's for Lizzie,
can you pass it to her?

04:09.075 --> 04:10.877
Let's hear what you got.

04:17.683 --> 04:19.752
I wanna hear it, let's go.

04:19.785 --> 04:22.822
"Wanna Netflix at mine,
then make out a little? LOL."

04:26.993 --> 04:29.695
Okay, I know
you didn't write that.

04:29.729 --> 04:31.631
Jake, why are you being stupid?

04:31.664 --> 04:33.199
What, it wasn't me, it was her!

04:33.232 --> 04:35.533
I'm not a her!

04:37.069 --> 04:40.006
Look, just
no more talking, okay?

04:40.039 --> 04:42.074
Everybody get back to work.

06:16.002 --> 06:18.536
Slow down, please, slow down.

06:20.773 --> 06:22.141
What's going on?

06:30.716 --> 06:33.686
Okay, just hang on, okay?

06:33.719 --> 06:36.188
Just sit tight, okay?

06:36.222 --> 06:39.759
Let me see what I can do,
all right?

06:39.792 --> 06:41.327
Okay.

06:41.360 --> 06:45.297
Class, I need
to finish this outside.

06:45.331 --> 06:47.733
Rory, you're gonna be my eyes
in the sky, okay?

06:47.767 --> 06:49.601
Everyone listen to Rory,

06:49.635 --> 06:51.603
and I'll be right back, okay?

06:51.637 --> 06:53.571
Can I go to the bathroom now?

07:21.400 --> 07:23.002
Yeah, fuck this.

07:23.035 --> 07:25.071
Jake, can you be quiet?

07:25.104 --> 07:26.372
Is nobody else
hearing this shit?

07:26.405 --> 07:27.873
Dude, I'm gonna tell
Mr. Johnson.

07:27.907 --> 07:29.275
No, I'm not gonna pretend
things are fine

07:29.308 --> 07:31.609
just 'cause Mr. Johnson did.

07:31.644 --> 07:33.045
Shit is clearly going down.

07:33.079 --> 07:34.346
How do you know?

07:34.380 --> 07:35.948
For one, that fucking cabinet

07:35.981 --> 07:38.117
sounds like
there's a huge dil...

07:38.150 --> 07:40.019
looks like it's gonna explode,

07:40.052 --> 07:41.987
and two, did you guys see
Mr. Johnson's face?

07:42.021 --> 07:45.224
That was a total
"shit's going down" face.

07:45.257 --> 07:47.793
The guy cannot hold his bluff.

08:00.139 --> 08:02.274
Jake, as stand-in
substitute teacher,

08:02.308 --> 08:05.277
- I want you to sit down.
- That's not even real.

08:13.919 --> 08:15.921
Hello, this is the office.

08:15.955 --> 08:20.860
Um, we're initiating a lockdown
for anyone on campus,

08:20.893 --> 08:23.362
so please stay in the classroom

08:23.395 --> 08:26.031
if you're still on campus

08:26.065 --> 08:27.733
and wait
for further instructions.

08:27.766 --> 08:28.934
Do not attempt to leave.

08:28.968 --> 08:31.871
Stay in the classroom.
Thank you.

08:31.904 --> 08:33.672
Hear how she sounded?

08:33.706 --> 08:34.974
She sounded
just like Mr. Johnson.

08:35.007 --> 08:36.442
- That means...
- Shit's going down.

08:36.475 --> 08:38.244
I wonder if it's Brandon.

08:38.277 --> 08:41.113
I know he collects, like,
shotguns and rifles and shit.

08:41.147 --> 08:42.715
I don't wanna get shot.

08:42.748 --> 08:45.050
- And what do you suggest?
- We should get our phones

08:45.084 --> 08:47.119
out of this locked
vibrating cabinet,

08:47.153 --> 08:50.055
but I'm not The Rock,
so we can't.

08:51.457 --> 08:55.261
Why'd he take his fucking keys?

09:12.945 --> 09:15.247
Yes, yes, that's right,
it seems to be hovering

09:15.281 --> 09:17.917
maybe two, three feet
above the ground.

09:17.950 --> 09:21.353
Military personnel
won't let us get close...

09:21.387 --> 09:23.022
I'm sorry, we're having trouble
hearing you.

09:23.055 --> 09:26.458
I said we're not able
to get any closer...

09:26.492 --> 09:28.360
Paul, you still there?

09:28.394 --> 09:29.495
Yeah, I'm still here.

09:29.528 --> 09:34.033
There seems to be a local man
walking towards this...

09:34.066 --> 09:37.736
He's just walking towards
the object and it seems...

09:37.770 --> 09:39.471
- Paul?
- We're not able

09:39.505 --> 09:42.908
- to get any closer to this...
- Stand down, sir.

09:42.942 --> 09:44.376
Stand down!

09:44.410 --> 09:45.911
They're raising their weapons
on the man.

09:45.945 --> 09:48.314
- I said stay where you are!
- Oh, fuck, oh, shi...

09:51.317 --> 09:53.085
Let's get our phones.

10:01.227 --> 10:02.928
Okay, here.

10:02.962 --> 10:04.797
Um...

10:04.830 --> 10:06.398
Rory, what are you doing?

10:06.432 --> 10:08.334
Hiding from the shooter.

10:08.367 --> 10:09.768
Okay.

10:12.871 --> 10:16.075
Uh, I don't think
it's a shooter.

10:16.108 --> 10:18.811
I got three missed calls
from my mom.

10:18.844 --> 10:22.881
That's weird,
she never fucking calls me.

10:22.915 --> 10:25.117
Nobody seems to know
why the school's on lockdown.

10:25.150 --> 10:27.086
I think we need to leave.

10:27.119 --> 10:27.987
It's a lockdown.

10:28.020 --> 10:30.089
That means we stay
locked down, right?

10:30.122 --> 10:32.057
Shut up, I'm trying
to call my mom.

10:32.091 --> 10:34.226
Dude, our teacher
didn't come back for us.

10:34.260 --> 10:35.427
Nobody else is here.

10:35.461 --> 10:37.029
Fuck, why is she not
picking up?

10:37.062 --> 10:39.198
You're just speculating.

10:39.231 --> 10:40.432
What am I speculating about?

10:40.466 --> 10:42.301
This is a frickin' lockdown.

10:42.334 --> 10:44.169
What if it's aliens?

10:57.249 --> 10:58.884
Ash.

11:03.856 --> 11:05.457
- Jesus.
- Fuck.

11:11.196 --> 11:13.198
What the fuck?

11:16.368 --> 11:17.870
Fuck.

11:26.445 --> 11:28.580
I think this is
a good time to go.

11:28.614 --> 11:30.516
Jake, we don't even know
what's out there.

11:30.549 --> 11:32.351
Out there is the exit.

11:32.384 --> 11:34.353
We want to exit
the situation, right?

11:34.386 --> 11:36.055
What? No.

11:36.088 --> 11:37.556
We do what's reasonable,
I mean, come on,

11:37.589 --> 11:40.159
remember Mr. Johnson's
scared shitless face?

11:40.192 --> 11:43.128
He didn't come back for us,
we're on our own.

11:43.162 --> 11:46.198
Or maybe he couldn't come back.

11:48.400 --> 11:50.102
Fucking jets.

11:50.135 --> 11:51.103
It's like death
,

11:51.136 --> 11:52.271
let's go, let's go.

11:52.304 --> 11:55.040
No, it doesn't feel safe
out there.

11:58.344 --> 12:00.012
Nowhere is safe.

12:00.045 --> 12:01.480
I say we move out.

12:37.282 --> 12:39.318
Ash.

12:39.351 --> 12:41.420
What's wrong?

12:41.453 --> 12:43.222
There's something there.

12:58.671 --> 13:00.205
Holy shit.

13:01.708 --> 13:03.242
What is that?

13:03.275 --> 13:04.943
I... I don't know.

13:18.323 --> 13:20.325
What is that thing?

13:22.361 --> 13:25.097
It's taking up
the whole hallway.

13:25.130 --> 13:27.499
Does that mean
we can't get out?

13:39.511 --> 13:42.147
Fuck.

13:42.181 --> 13:44.416
"Report object
to authorities ASAP"?

13:44.450 --> 13:46.051
"Get the fuck out
if you see one."

13:46.084 --> 13:48.987
"Reported missing persons:
4,200."

13:49.021 --> 13:51.190
"If you hear voices,
go to the hospital."

13:51.223 --> 13:53.492
Some people are saying
it's talking to them.

14:12.177 --> 14:14.213
Holy shit.

14:14.246 --> 14:16.248
That shouldn't happen.

14:16.281 --> 14:17.750
No, it fucking shouldn't.

14:26.325 --> 14:28.628
Maybe it's transporting them
somewhere.

14:30.562 --> 14:33.398
Why does everything you say
have to sound super scary?

14:33.432 --> 14:36.335
M... maybe everyone's
on the other side of it?

14:36.368 --> 14:38.470
Hello?

14:38.504 --> 14:41.373
Mr. Johnson, I don't wanna be
in charge anymore.

14:54.687 --> 14:56.455
Let's find another way out.

14:56.488 --> 14:58.390
What if we go inside it?

15:00.827 --> 15:02.762
Uh, okay?

15:02.795 --> 15:05.097
You're a weirdo
and you're crazy.

15:05.130 --> 15:06.565
It's official.

15:06.598 --> 15:10.335
What are you talking about?

15:10.369 --> 15:13.372
Maybe it takes us somewhere.

15:13.405 --> 15:17.075
Like somewhere else.

15:17.109 --> 15:18.745
I don't want to go
somewhere else,

15:18.778 --> 15:22.114
I want to just get
the fuck outta here.

15:22.147 --> 15:23.248
I'm with Jake.

15:23.282 --> 15:24.651
You're crazy.

15:29.154 --> 15:30.723
There might be an exit up here.

15:30.757 --> 15:32.190
Maybe it's a bathroom.

15:32.224 --> 15:34.092
Who the hell knows
at this point?

15:59.752 --> 16:00.887
Ash.

16:21.406 --> 16:23.575
Ash, what are you thinking?

16:26.478 --> 16:29.581
I was just getting
a closer look.

16:29.615 --> 16:30.650
Ash.

16:32.250 --> 16:34.453
You can tell me anything.

17:06.819 --> 17:09.621
What the fuck was that?

17:09.656 --> 17:11.758
Jake, please, stop.

17:18.965 --> 17:20.967
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.535
You need to calm down.

17:32.277 --> 17:33.646
- Don't touch her.
- Guys, stop.

17:33.680 --> 17:35.447
Jake, it's okay.

17:38.651 --> 17:39.652
You know what, yeah, no,

17:39.686 --> 17:42.587
I'm not gonna play this game.

17:44.791 --> 17:46.726
I don't fucking fight girls.

17:49.729 --> 17:51.998
What are you doing?

17:52.031 --> 17:53.900
Guys, stop it!

17:56.334 --> 17:57.637
Guys!

17:57.670 --> 17:59.005
- God, you guys, stop it.
- I don't have my glasses,

17:59.038 --> 18:01.440
I can't see.

18:01.473 --> 18:02.541
Watch out!

18:07.546 --> 18:08.781
Sorry.

18:10.717 --> 18:13.418
Ash? You okay?

18:13.452 --> 18:15.554
I'm sorry, I just got scared.

18:15.587 --> 18:16.756
I'm sorry!

18:30.602 --> 18:32.805
Did they just...

18:38.443 --> 18:39.444
I'm sorry.

18:39.478 --> 18:41.781
I didn't mean to.

18:41.814 --> 18:42.982
I couldn't see them.

18:43.015 --> 18:44.817
Why would you do that?

18:44.851 --> 18:45.885
I was just trying
to defend mys...

18:45.918 --> 18:47.586
No.

19:05.071 --> 19:07.472
It's all my fault.

19:12.544 --> 19:14.446
Ash?

19:14.479 --> 19:16.082
Ash, what are you doing?

19:31.030 --> 19:32.497
Fuck.

19:47.113 --> 19:48.815
Rory?

19:52.852 --> 19:54.519
Jake?

19:59.591 --> 20:00.860
Ash.

21:30.883 --> 21:33.485
Hey, folks,
it's Martin Midnight,

21:33.518 --> 21:36.488
and this is Midnight Buzz

21:36.521 --> 21:38.925
where we explore the strange,

21:38.958 --> 21:40.159
the paranormal,

21:40.192 --> 21:41.994
the unexplained,

21:42.028 --> 21:45.031
and the downright weird
of the week.

21:45.064 --> 21:46.132
Midnighters, welcome.

21:46.165 --> 21:48.734
A big show, we've got a lot
to talk about tonight.

21:48.768 --> 21:50.236
As you probably know,

21:50.269 --> 21:52.504
unless you've been living
in a hole,

21:52.537 --> 21:53.873
these things...
and you know exactly

21:53.906 --> 21:55.708
what I'm talking about,
I think the scientists

21:55.741 --> 21:56.943
have finally named them

21:56.976 --> 21:59.477
a fucking
brilliantly stupid name,

21:59.511 --> 22:02.648
doors... started appearing
all over the world

22:02.682 --> 22:04.116
just a few weeks ago,

22:04.150 --> 22:06.886
and as we all know,
shit has been getting

22:06.919 --> 22:11.023
really, really, well, weird.

22:11.057 --> 22:13.491
Many millions
of our loved ones

22:13.525 --> 22:14.860
have gone missing, folks,

22:14.894 --> 22:17.930
and, you know,
many more are presumed dead.

22:17.964 --> 22:20.933
But listen,
the even weirder thing

22:20.967 --> 22:23.002
is that some have returned

22:23.035 --> 22:26.005
from wherever the fuck
they've been.

22:26.038 --> 22:28.107
And the Knockers program,
my God,

22:28.140 --> 22:30.643
this thing apparently
goes into effect today.

22:30.676 --> 22:31.476
Have you guys heard about this?

22:31.509 --> 22:35.047
This thing has
literal volunteers,

22:35.081 --> 22:39.885
people volunteering
to go into the doors.

22:39.919 --> 22:44.657
Yeah, the same things
that cause people to kill

22:44.690 --> 22:47.693
or make people go crazy.

22:47.727 --> 22:50.763
You know, it's fucking baffling.

22:50.796 --> 22:52.898
I don't know what's more stupid:

22:52.932 --> 22:54.767
the offensive term "Knockers,"

22:54.800 --> 22:55.901
I mean, come on,

22:55.935 --> 22:58.637
or the people who think
it's a good idea

22:58.671 --> 23:02.274
for civilians
to go into a door.

23:02.308 --> 23:06.611
But we'll see in
the next 24 hours, I guess.

23:06.645 --> 23:08.647
Good luck, volunteers.

23:26.832 --> 23:29.035
I'm an incubator of life.

23:31.037 --> 23:32.738
I can't move.

23:34.740 --> 23:37.176
I'm stuck.

23:37.209 --> 23:39.912
Waiting.

23:39.945 --> 23:42.314
Always waiting for a wave.

23:46.385 --> 23:48.821
You're a wave.

23:48.854 --> 23:51.724
You flow.

23:51.757 --> 23:53.692
You rage.

23:57.129 --> 24:00.766
You exist by being shapeless,

24:00.800 --> 24:06.305
yet I exist only through shape.

24:06.338 --> 24:10.176
The shape that you created.

24:10.209 --> 24:12.845
I'm blocked.

24:12.878 --> 24:14.612
I'm trapped.

24:16.382 --> 24:18.651
A prisoner to the ocean...

24:20.719 --> 24:23.189
...waiting for
your shapeless form

24:23.222 --> 24:25.191
to consume me,

24:25.224 --> 24:27.760
and I fucking hate it.

24:34.033 --> 24:36.969
I don't know,
that's all I've got so far.

24:38.671 --> 24:40.372
I like it!

24:40.406 --> 24:44.276
I love how badass
you made the waves.

24:46.679 --> 24:48.647
It's like, you know,
billions of years

24:48.681 --> 24:51.350
of just shaping each other.

24:51.383 --> 24:53.419
It's unreal.

24:53.452 --> 24:55.121
Poor rocks.

24:57.156 --> 24:59.191
It kind of sucks.

25:00.993 --> 25:03.395
They're rocks.

25:03.429 --> 25:07.166
That's their purpose,
they don't have a choice.

25:11.370 --> 25:14.240
You worried about the rocks?

25:14.273 --> 25:16.175
Rocks got you down?

25:17.376 --> 25:20.146
You wanna do some rock therapy?

25:20.179 --> 25:21.714
I'm a good listener!

25:21.747 --> 25:22.915
I really am!

25:22.948 --> 25:24.750
- No.
- All right.

25:24.783 --> 25:26.185
Rocks are tough.

25:26.218 --> 25:27.786
Like you.

25:27.820 --> 25:29.054
They're tough, they're strong,

25:29.088 --> 25:31.824
they're independent women
like you.

25:39.999 --> 25:41.800
Phaser set to kill, Captain.

25:41.834 --> 25:43.903
Okay, let's practice
some gun safety.

25:43.936 --> 25:45.437
All right?

26:50.269 --> 26:51.303
So you're telling me
you really wouldn't want

26:51.337 --> 26:53.339
to live here, huh?

26:53.372 --> 26:55.808
Too moody and kinda cold.

26:55.841 --> 26:59.445
Well, it's the future,
just stay inside.

26:59.478 --> 27:02.114
How come you never ask me
where I wanna live, huh?

27:04.116 --> 27:06.418
Where do you wanna live, Beck?

27:06.452 --> 27:08.487
Did I mention I love you?

27:08.520 --> 27:10.222
Not while you're this Vince.

27:10.256 --> 27:12.858
I don't like this Vince either.

27:12.891 --> 27:15.327
What Vince do you want?

27:15.361 --> 27:17.096
You gotta ask it on your own.

27:17.129 --> 27:20.065
Yo, Knockers!

27:20.099 --> 27:21.400
Got eyes on them.

27:21.433 --> 27:22.901
Where you been?

27:22.935 --> 27:25.337
- You gotta bump it, dude.
- Knockers inbound.

27:25.371 --> 27:27.339
Now you may speak.

27:27.373 --> 27:28.841
My guys confirmed
that the house structure

27:28.874 --> 27:30.376
is stable enough for now.

27:52.031 --> 27:53.999
Poor rocks.

27:58.137 --> 28:00.406
How do they stand it
for so long?

28:05.411 --> 28:07.479
I don't want to be a rock.

28:22.294 --> 28:25.397
I want to be a wave.

28:25.431 --> 28:27.566
Three cans, please.

28:30.569 --> 28:32.471
- Where's Prince?
- No, no, sideways,

28:32.504 --> 28:34.006
take it sideways, sideways.

28:34.039 --> 28:35.174
Take it, take it now.

28:35.207 --> 28:37.009
- Take it now.
- Oh, God.

28:37.042 --> 28:38.277
So I've been thinking about it,

28:38.310 --> 28:40.045
that thing with the birds?

28:40.079 --> 28:42.214
So you know every time
Whiz does that thing?

28:42.247 --> 28:44.483
You know, when it kind of
throws off our compass,

28:44.516 --> 28:46.552
I think what's happening

28:46.585 --> 28:48.187
is the same thing
with the birds.

28:48.220 --> 28:50.322
He does the thing, they die,
they fall out of the sky.

28:50.356 --> 28:52.458
- That makes sense.
- It's just a theory, but...

28:56.095 --> 28:57.196
You guys ready to get weird?

28:57.229 --> 28:59.164
Can you get this?

29:05.170 --> 29:07.973
You guys are too cute.

29:08.006 --> 29:09.608
You got your phaser, Becky?

29:09.642 --> 29:11.210
Right here,
and it's set to kill.

29:11.243 --> 29:14.113
- Don't shoot.
- KT421, this is HQ,

29:14.146 --> 29:17.483
- do you copy?
- KT421, copy.

29:17.516 --> 29:19.385
KT421, you have been
given green light

29:19.418 --> 29:20.619
to enter your door.

29:20.653 --> 29:22.321
You have a go-ahead.

29:22.354 --> 29:24.223
Copy that, it's about time.

29:24.256 --> 29:25.624
I also want to remind
you that your boys

29:25.658 --> 29:28.160
only have 12 minutes
to get out.

29:28.193 --> 29:30.496
Um, sorry, ma'am,
did you say 12 minutes?

29:30.529 --> 29:33.265
The Astoria team got 15,
what's up with that?

29:33.298 --> 29:36.101
Well, Astoria team
didn't make it.

29:36.135 --> 29:37.936
So that's your new time,
Lieutenant.

29:40.105 --> 29:41.106
Wait, what was that?

29:43.242 --> 29:45.544
I keep getting
this fucking Spanish station.

30:31.356 --> 30:32.624
What is this?

30:47.606 --> 30:48.741
Knockers, come in.

30:48.775 --> 30:50.509
You guys got 12 minutes
inside that door.

30:50.542 --> 30:52.344
- You hear me?
- Yeah, copy.

30:52.377 --> 30:54.480
Entering the house now.

30:54.513 --> 30:56.615
Why is he so fucking annoying?

30:56.649 --> 30:58.484
Your mic's still on, Becky.

31:04.189 --> 31:05.357
Knockers here.

31:05.390 --> 31:06.659
It seems as though the door

31:06.693 --> 31:09.194
is pulling shit towards it.

31:09.228 --> 31:11.597
Huh.

31:11.631 --> 31:14.166
Unit K138 approaching our door.

31:22.441 --> 31:24.176
This one's huge.

31:24.209 --> 31:26.713
- That's what she said.
- Ew.

31:30.549 --> 31:32.752
I don't want to be a rock.

31:32.785 --> 31:35.454
Whoa, did you guys hear that?

31:35.487 --> 31:38.156
Yeah.

31:38.190 --> 31:40.259
Smooth jazz.

31:40.292 --> 31:42.361
Whiz, begin that timer.

31:42.394 --> 31:43.730
Don't lose your shit
in there, guys.

31:43.763 --> 31:46.498
Three, two, one.

32:04.383 --> 32:06.184
Welcome.

32:14.526 --> 32:17.764
Did we just beam in?

32:17.797 --> 32:20.198
Dreams do come true.

32:20.232 --> 32:22.702
Looks like we're on
the other side of the house.

32:22.735 --> 32:25.805
Room is void of color,
but kinda cool.

32:25.838 --> 32:29.474
Doesn't seem to be
the same house.

32:29.508 --> 32:31.109
Did this room get bigger?

32:31.143 --> 32:33.646
Maybe. I see three doorways.

32:40.687 --> 32:42.554
All right, where to first?

32:42.588 --> 32:44.724
I call dibs
on this pink hallway.

32:44.757 --> 32:46.425
If we split up,
we can document more.

32:46.458 --> 32:48.695
Yeah, I'm not sure
that's a good idea.

32:48.728 --> 32:50.529
Cool.

32:50.562 --> 32:52.264
Beck, you know,
we don't all have a gun.

32:52.297 --> 32:53.800
It's a phaser!

32:59.371 --> 33:02.240
You have 11 minutes remaining.

33:30.737 --> 33:34.641
Lights don't work.

33:34.674 --> 33:37.442
The symmetry is pretty dope.

33:37.476 --> 33:39.578
Upload this shit.

33:51.590 --> 33:53.492
Hello?

34:00.365 --> 34:03.402
I think I found something.

34:03.435 --> 34:06.204
Dead leaves scattered
on the floor,

34:06.238 --> 34:08.407
not a good sign.

34:08.440 --> 34:10.308
Keep it together, Pat.

34:10.342 --> 34:12.812
It's not anything
you can't handle.

34:33.398 --> 34:36.435
Source of sound appears
to be coming from a woman.

34:36.468 --> 34:38.871
Why are you looking at me
like that?

34:40.807 --> 34:44.242
Possible door entity.

34:44.276 --> 34:50.016
She appears to be
very, very real.

34:50.049 --> 34:52.417
I'm in some sort of room.

34:52.451 --> 34:54.486
Flowers.

34:54.519 --> 34:56.823
What the fuck is going on?

34:56.856 --> 34:59.992
Excuse me, do you have a name?

35:00.026 --> 35:02.628
How can you not remember
my name?

35:02.662 --> 35:06.431
It's Rose.

35:06.465 --> 35:07.867
No, it's not.

35:07.900 --> 35:10.737
Nine minutes.

35:21.580 --> 35:24.951
It's a kitchen.

35:24.984 --> 35:26.384
It's all white.

35:29.889 --> 35:35.995
There's various objects
facing weird directions.

35:36.028 --> 35:38.631
There's baby bottles
upside down.

35:43.368 --> 35:44.569
There's a cradle.

35:50.943 --> 35:53.980
Seems to be moving on its own.

35:56.682 --> 35:58.450
It's empty.

36:27.747 --> 36:31.416
This rooms seems to be
'80s chic.

36:31.449 --> 36:32.752
Oh, this guy went national!

36:32.785 --> 36:34.486
Nice!

36:34.519 --> 36:35.955
Looks like he played shortstop.

36:35.988 --> 36:39.591
Uh, clock is set
at three o'clock.

36:39.624 --> 36:41.861
Got a weird marble bust here.

36:41.894 --> 36:43.963
What's up, dude?

36:53.739 --> 36:57.944
Appears to be another room
identical to the previous,

36:57.977 --> 37:01.080
but slightly more awesome.

37:01.113 --> 37:02.414
What?

37:02.447 --> 37:05.450
Science nerd beer bong.

37:05.483 --> 37:11.157
This bust seems
a little more melancholy.

37:11.190 --> 37:15.928
Uh, this clock's set at six.

37:15.962 --> 37:20.599
Next room, similar to the last.

37:20.633 --> 37:23.636
Got some globe action.

37:23.669 --> 37:27.907
Another slightly pissed bust.

37:30.176 --> 37:32.879
Clock set at nine.

37:32.912 --> 37:36.883
This room is darker,

37:36.916 --> 37:39.886
a little more fucking creepy.

37:39.919 --> 37:45.557
Uh, this bust has
some sort of square eyes.

38:04.710 --> 38:06.012
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

38:06.045 --> 38:07.579
Hey, relax.

38:07.612 --> 38:08.781
Can you hear me?

38:10.548 --> 38:11.817
Hey, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on,

38:11.851 --> 38:12.985
listen to my voice,
listen to my voice.

38:13.019 --> 38:13.986
Don't do this to me, I'm sorry.

38:14.020 --> 38:15.087
Come back, come back,
come back, it's okay.

38:15.121 --> 38:17.189
Rose, I'm sorry, stop,
stop, stop, please, please.

38:17.223 --> 38:19.926
Hey, hey.

38:19.959 --> 38:21.694
Come back.

38:25.064 --> 38:27.833
- What the f...
- I miss you, Patty.

38:33.039 --> 38:35.141
Are you gonna leave me again?

38:45.418 --> 38:46.953
Hey.

38:48.888 --> 38:51.223
You feeling better?

38:53.292 --> 38:57.997
Super rough morning.

38:58.030 --> 38:59.899
It's still spotty.

38:59.932 --> 39:02.034
I finished the wall.

39:06.973 --> 39:11.711
Are you ready
for Dr. Chang's class?

39:11.744 --> 39:14.180
I think he likes us.

39:16.983 --> 39:19.251
Hello.

39:24.023 --> 39:27.059
Honey, you okay?

39:27.093 --> 39:29.862
Stay back.

39:31.964 --> 39:34.166
Honey.

39:34.200 --> 39:35.801
Don't call me that.

39:35.835 --> 39:38.671
Beck, what's wrong?

39:38.704 --> 39:41.841
Is she okay?

39:41.874 --> 39:43.976
What is this?

39:44.010 --> 39:45.211
What is this?

39:45.244 --> 39:47.146
Is the baby okay?

39:47.179 --> 39:48.314
What?

39:50.316 --> 39:51.583
What'd you do to me?

39:51.616 --> 39:55.087
What did I do to you?

39:55.121 --> 39:57.723
Stop this right now.

39:57.757 --> 39:59.959
Stop what?

39:59.992 --> 40:02.294
Do you notice it?

40:02.328 --> 40:05.765
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

40:17.176 --> 40:19.345
We chose to do this together.

40:19.378 --> 40:21.814
I didn't choose this.

40:21.847 --> 40:25.151
Now just put your toy down,
this is ridiculous.

40:25.184 --> 40:27.086
Calm down, Beck.

40:27.119 --> 40:29.055
This isn't good for the baby.

40:29.088 --> 40:32.892
This is the door,
this is the door.

40:32.925 --> 40:35.995
Babe, the door was
three years ago.

40:36.028 --> 40:37.863
No, no.

40:44.970 --> 40:48.307
Caution, five minutes remaining.

40:54.313 --> 40:56.382
Ah, God.

41:03.789 --> 41:05.324
What'd I tell you
about these, okay?

41:05.357 --> 41:07.359
How many times?

41:23.709 --> 41:25.277
What the fuck?

41:56.342 --> 41:58.777
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

42:36.248 --> 42:38.851
- Do you need your meds?
- No!

42:38.884 --> 42:40.352
You okay?

42:40.386 --> 42:42.388
Ugh!

42:45.224 --> 42:47.026
- Babe, it's okay.
- I'm not your babe.

42:47.059 --> 42:49.295
Come on, look at me.

42:49.328 --> 42:51.830
Babe, stop, babe, it's okay.

42:57.436 --> 42:59.338
Babe.

42:59.371 --> 43:00.873
Come on.

43:00.906 --> 43:02.474
You're gonna
murder me with a toy?

43:02.508 --> 43:04.410
- Really?
- It's not a toy.

43:04.443 --> 43:06.478
We chose this, baby, just,

43:06.512 --> 43:08.247
just put the toy down.

43:11.283 --> 43:13.819
Come on.

43:13.852 --> 43:16.021
Caution,
three minutes remaining.

43:16.055 --> 43:17.856
It's a phaser.

44:08.841 --> 44:12.044
I re-entered a new room.

44:30.429 --> 44:32.298
It's a picture of me and Beck.

44:46.512 --> 44:48.080
Who the hell are you?

44:52.518 --> 44:55.087
Who the fuck are you?

45:09.034 --> 45:12.371
Caution,
three minutes remaining.

45:12.404 --> 45:14.173
Who are you?

45:14.206 --> 45:17.309
I'm... I'm... I'm in
some kind of hallucination

45:17.343 --> 45:19.178
that looks like
Beck and my apartment.

45:19.211 --> 45:21.513
There are copies of myself,

45:21.547 --> 45:23.949
clearly entities
created by the door.

45:23.982 --> 45:25.451
Wha... what did you call me?

45:25.484 --> 45:28.887
One of the copies is engaging
in a conversation with me.

45:28.921 --> 45:30.589
Yeah, there you go again.

45:30.622 --> 45:31.590
- Caution...
- Beck!

45:31.623 --> 45:32.925
You think you're the real Vince?

45:32.958 --> 45:34.326
Beck, I'm getting
psychosis beeps!

45:34.360 --> 45:36.095
You really think
you're the real Vince.

45:36.128 --> 45:37.896
Beck, I need help!

45:37.930 --> 45:39.498
What makes you so sure?

45:39.531 --> 45:41.066
- Caution.
- Which one of us

45:41.100 --> 45:42.669
is wearing the suit,
huh, smart guy?

45:44.704 --> 45:46.305
Nice try.

45:46.338 --> 45:47.473
He's right.

45:49.341 --> 45:51.610
This is probably
a hallucination.

45:53.680 --> 45:55.948
We're probably entities.

45:55.981 --> 45:57.216
No, I don't think so.

45:57.249 --> 46:01.220
Man, I told you,
I'm wearing the suit!

46:01.253 --> 46:03.555
I said I got the suit.

46:07.159 --> 46:10.062
Caution,
two minutes remaining.

46:12.331 --> 46:14.066
This isn't happening.

46:43.128 --> 46:44.229
Hey.

46:55.441 --> 46:57.976
This our home?

46:58.010 --> 46:59.311
It's the door.

46:59.344 --> 47:01.480
Okay, that's why you're
seeing these copies.

47:01.513 --> 47:02.682
Copies?

47:19.565 --> 47:22.301
What, what's happening?

47:27.172 --> 47:29.174
- What's happening?
- Babe, look at me,

47:29.208 --> 47:31.744
we're entering psychosis.

47:31.778 --> 47:35.013
- They aren't real.
- Shut up!

47:37.316 --> 47:39.451
Who's the real Vince?

47:39.485 --> 47:42.287
Babe, look at me.

47:42.321 --> 47:45.090
I am.

47:45.123 --> 47:48.460
- I'm real.
- Babe, he's lying.

47:48.494 --> 47:50.562
I'm real.

47:53.198 --> 47:55.067
Maybe it's what we're wearing.

47:57.202 --> 47:58.170
Why are you wearing rain gear?

47:58.203 --> 47:59.371
It's sunny out.

48:04.510 --> 48:06.211
Oh, come on.

48:06.245 --> 48:08.213
Come on, since when does
the fuckin' door make sense,

48:08.247 --> 48:10.549
babe, listen!

48:10.582 --> 48:11.718
Babe, listen to me.

48:18.457 --> 48:21.226
Alert.

48:21.260 --> 48:24.329
Get close.

48:24.363 --> 48:25.497
Get close.

48:29.234 --> 48:33.238
Hawaiian shirt, jeans.

48:33.272 --> 48:35.340
Sweater, pants.

48:35.374 --> 48:37.777
Babe, please put the gun down.

48:37.810 --> 48:41.380
Babe, put down the phaser.

48:41.413 --> 48:43.415
What did you say?

48:43.448 --> 48:45.617
Babe, babe,
he's fucking conning you.

48:45.652 --> 48:46.719
Okay, I'm sorry,

48:46.753 --> 48:48.855
I'm sorry that I forgot
that it's a phaser, but...

48:48.888 --> 48:52.190
Told me you were pregnant.

48:52.224 --> 48:54.827
What'd you say?

48:54.861 --> 48:57.195
What did you say?

48:57.229 --> 48:58.163
That day at the beach,

48:58.196 --> 49:01.333
and you said you didn't wanna,

49:01.366 --> 49:03.770
you didn't wanna keep it, but...

49:03.803 --> 49:06.171
Baby.

49:06.204 --> 49:08.240
But then I told you to keep it.

49:16.515 --> 49:17.616
I remember that.

49:17.650 --> 49:18.685
I got a nose bleed,

49:18.718 --> 49:21.119
and it got all over our clothes.

49:21.153 --> 49:22.521
Look at your shirt.

49:26.558 --> 49:29.194
I'm sorry I pushed you.

49:29.227 --> 49:32.397
I'm sorry I lied.

49:32.431 --> 49:36.535
I'm sorry for a lot of things.

49:40.673 --> 49:44.309
He's the real Vince.

49:44.343 --> 49:45.678
Hear that?

49:45.712 --> 49:47.613
I'm the OG.

49:51.216 --> 49:53.251
Sorry, dude, nothing personal.

50:00.459 --> 50:02.527
Danger.

50:07.399 --> 50:09.769
I don't wanna be a rock anymore.

50:09.802 --> 50:11.303
What, what the fuck...

50:25.952 --> 50:27.419
It's my turn.

50:37.864 --> 50:39.732
It's my turn to be a wave.

50:42.669 --> 50:43.836
Okay.

50:59.986 --> 51:02.922
Okay, uh, Midnighters, wow,

51:02.955 --> 51:06.291
it's, um...

51:06.324 --> 51:09.494
So now what, huh?

51:09.528 --> 51:11.698
Jesus.

51:11.731 --> 51:14.000
It's been, uh,

51:14.033 --> 51:16.368
weeks since the disastrous

51:16.401 --> 51:19.237
Knockers program,

51:19.271 --> 51:21.606
and we are definitely worse off
than when we started.

51:21.641 --> 51:26.478
You know, I wish I could say
that this is all weird,

51:26.511 --> 51:29.682
but the government failures
like this are far from weird,

51:29.716 --> 51:31.583
and you know exactly
what I'm talkin' about.

51:31.616 --> 51:33.920
It's all part of that
Big Brother bullshit

51:33.953 --> 51:35.554
that we've all eaten up since

51:35.587 --> 51:36.889
the start of
modern civilization.

51:36.923 --> 51:39.357
But you know
what's different, folks,

51:39.391 --> 51:41.526
now is that we have birds

51:41.560 --> 51:44.764
and fuckin' satellites
falling from the sky,

51:44.797 --> 51:47.299
crazy weather shifts
that make zero sense,

51:47.332 --> 51:48.266
and not to mention

51:48.300 --> 51:52.772
half of the world's
population is missing.

51:52.805 --> 51:54.539
Open your eyes!

51:57.877 --> 51:59.879
You know what, though,
I'll tell ya nature must be

51:59.912 --> 52:01.814
loving less humans right now,

52:01.848 --> 52:03.448
but I sure am

52:03.482 --> 52:06.686
pretty weirded out.

52:06.719 --> 52:11.523
And is this even
reality right now? Fuck!

52:11.556 --> 52:13.926
Fuck if I know.

52:13.960 --> 52:15.928
But...

52:15.962 --> 52:18.831
what Midnight does know, folks,

52:18.865 --> 52:21.500
is that it's getting worse,

52:21.533 --> 52:25.437
and we deserve answers.

52:25.470 --> 52:29.474
So, stay tuned for
my next guest tomorrow,

52:29.508 --> 52:33.780
who has some interesting
answers for us.

52:33.813 --> 52:37.717
This is Martin Midnight.

52:37.750 --> 52:39.584
Stay weird.

53:08.480 --> 53:09.447
...know about you,
but I'm pretty sure that

53:09.481 --> 53:11.818
if I had one of those
things in my backyard,

53:11.851 --> 53:13.052
I'd call someone.

53:13.085 --> 53:15.587
But that's not the best part,
she named it.

53:15.620 --> 53:17.522
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
let's talk about something

53:17.556 --> 53:18.891
very important here.

53:18.925 --> 53:22.128
- What did she call it?
- Ready for the name?

53:22.161 --> 53:23.996
- Ferdinand.
- Whoa, what?

53:24.030 --> 53:26.032
- Ferdinand the door?
- Yeah, that's right.

53:26.065 --> 53:28.500
And on that note, to all
of my listeners out there,

53:28.533 --> 53:30.468
please take heed,
if you see a door,

53:30.502 --> 53:31.971
report it to
the local authorities.

53:32.004 --> 53:34.106
Don't approach it.

53:34.140 --> 53:37.609
And for God's sakes,
don't name them!

53:37.643 --> 53:38.978
Be safe and call for help, okay?

53:39.011 --> 53:41.681
Stay inside,
and in the meantime...

54:52.985 --> 54:55.955
Hi, Jamal Adkins, day four.

54:55.988 --> 54:57.757
Let's proceed.

55:01.127 --> 55:02.494
Hey, buddy.

55:05.530 --> 55:08.134
How are we feeling today?

55:08.167 --> 55:11.671
Tell you what,
I am feeling very good,

55:11.704 --> 55:15.041
and it's because of you.

55:15.074 --> 55:18.576
And I know that it's
gonna be a good day.

55:18.610 --> 55:22.114
And that should make you feel

55:22.148 --> 55:23.883
pretty good.

55:29.554 --> 55:31.623
Hmm.

55:31.657 --> 55:33.960
I see.

55:33.993 --> 55:36.662
Same foul mood as yesterday.

55:36.696 --> 55:40.900
But, we're not gonna
let that stop us

55:40.933 --> 55:43.102
with the work we have to do,

55:43.135 --> 55:47.740
which is plenty.

55:47.773 --> 55:49.909
So we tried that yesterday,
and it didn't work.

55:49.942 --> 55:52.845
So, we need to
try something else.

55:52.878 --> 55:54.747
Well, we did.

55:54.780 --> 55:56.082
We tried that yesterday.

55:57.883 --> 55:59.617
Look, I know you're from

55:59.652 --> 56:01.787
an advanced civilization,
but I was here.

56:01.821 --> 56:06.225
We tried that, and we need
to try something else.

56:06.258 --> 56:10.029
Maybe if we stuck
in more frequencies.

56:12.131 --> 56:14.734
See if we can get anything

56:14.767 --> 56:16.969
besides mud.

56:17.003 --> 56:18.204
Am I coming through?

56:18.237 --> 56:19.972
Hello, hello?

56:22.607 --> 56:25.978
Hello?

56:34.120 --> 56:36.621
Hey.

56:36.655 --> 56:38.858
- Hello, friend.
- Hello?

56:41.093 --> 56:42.862
What about now?

56:53.105 --> 56:54.874
Hello?

57:19.665 --> 57:20.866
Hello?

57:25.004 --> 57:26.172
Hello.

57:33.679 --> 57:37.149
Let's talk.

57:37.183 --> 57:39.985
Whoa.

57:40.019 --> 57:42.188
Holy fucking Christ.

57:45.825 --> 57:48.828
Can...

57:48.861 --> 57:49.929
Can you hear me?

57:49.962 --> 57:53.666
- Can you...
- Yes, Jamal Adkins.

57:53.699 --> 57:55.000
Social security number,

57:55.034 --> 57:57.670
765-56-7682.

57:57.703 --> 58:02.741
Holy fuck, holy, holy fuck!

58:02.775 --> 58:04.043
You can just call me Jamal.

58:04.076 --> 58:08.314
- You can just...
- Hi, Jamal.

58:08.347 --> 58:10.249
Hello.

58:10.282 --> 58:13.252
Friend, Jamal, buddy.

58:13.285 --> 58:15.821
Hey, can I,

58:15.855 --> 58:17.423
can I get you to
talk to the camera?

58:17.456 --> 58:20.359
Can you answer some
questions for the camera?

58:20.392 --> 58:23.162
I... Can you tell

58:23.195 --> 58:26.098
the camera who you are?

58:26.132 --> 58:28.234
I'm your friend.

58:28.267 --> 58:30.069
How are you?

58:30.102 --> 58:32.104
I'm pretty fucking good.

58:32.138 --> 58:36.709
I'm pretty fucking good,
can you, can you tell me

58:36.742 --> 58:39.778
where, where are you from?

58:39.812 --> 58:44.250
We have come upon the planet.

58:44.283 --> 58:48.020
We watch sentient beings.

58:48.053 --> 58:49.455
- You stay alive...
- Jamal?

58:49.488 --> 58:53.726
- ...for now.
- Friend.

58:53.759 --> 58:56.862
Can you tell the camera
what your species is?

58:56.896 --> 58:59.198
We archive.

58:59.231 --> 59:02.468
We will refresh all of you.

59:02.501 --> 59:05.204
We archive Earth.

59:44.410 --> 59:46.378
- Cathy.
- Jamal.

59:46.412 --> 59:48.013
Please, come here.

59:53.219 --> 59:55.988
- Um, this is Leo.
- 'Sup, I'm Leo.

59:56.021 --> 59:57.089
I'm her boyfriend.

59:57.122 --> 59:59.391
Oh.

59:59.425 --> 1:00:01.794
Jamal.

1:00:01.827 --> 1:00:03.395
Sorry.

1:00:03.429 --> 1:00:04.530
Those organic?

1:00:04.563 --> 1:00:07.366
No.

1:00:13.205 --> 1:00:14.940
Are you ready?

1:00:14.974 --> 1:00:17.776
- Yes, ready.
- Mm-hm.

1:00:23.449 --> 1:00:26.285
He chews loudly
when he's nervous.

1:00:26.318 --> 1:00:28.254
I'm not nervous.

1:00:28.287 --> 1:00:29.521
I, you know,

1:00:29.555 --> 1:00:31.523
we're lucky to be in one piece

1:00:31.557 --> 1:00:34.326
with those doors
out there killing people.

1:00:34.360 --> 1:00:36.895
I'm pretty sure they're here for
more than just killing people.

1:00:39.498 --> 1:00:44.570
Um, did you go crazy before
they let you go, or after?

1:00:44.603 --> 1:00:46.171
Jesus, Leo.

1:00:46.205 --> 1:00:47.306
No offense.

1:00:47.339 --> 1:00:51.343
He was fired for his brilliant,
yet controversial ideas.

1:00:51.377 --> 1:00:52.978
I'm sorry.

1:00:53.012 --> 1:00:55.014
What did you wanna
tell us, Jamal?

1:00:55.047 --> 1:00:59.451
Literally,
on the edge of my seat.

1:00:59.485 --> 1:01:02.888
Cathy, I asked you to come here
because you're my friend,

1:01:02.921 --> 1:01:06.892
and I know that we haven't
seen each other much lately,

1:01:06.925 --> 1:01:11.397
but you're still
my most trusted companion

1:01:11.430 --> 1:01:13.932
in the scientific community.

1:01:13.966 --> 1:01:18.103
Um, Leo, you're here

1:01:18.137 --> 1:01:19.438
'cause Cathy brought you.

1:01:19.471 --> 1:01:23.108
But if Cathy trusts you,
then I trust you.

1:01:23.142 --> 1:01:25.844
Oh, that's great, yeah,
that's great.

1:01:25.878 --> 1:01:27.212
Either you end my anticipation,

1:01:27.246 --> 1:01:30.215
or I'm gonna end
both of your lives.

1:01:30.249 --> 1:01:32.117
I have a door.

1:01:32.151 --> 1:01:33.319
That's my announcement,

1:01:33.352 --> 1:01:35.854
which you both

1:01:35.888 --> 1:01:36.989
kind of ruined.

1:01:37.022 --> 1:01:40.392
But I have a door.

1:01:40.426 --> 1:01:42.094
Bullshit!

1:01:42.127 --> 1:01:44.596
No, if you had a door,

1:01:44.631 --> 1:01:47.032
there would be, like,
a million of those Knockers here

1:01:47.066 --> 1:01:49.468
- sterilizing this entire place.
- Sure, if they knew,

1:01:49.501 --> 1:01:52.971
they'd be here,
but I didn't report it.

1:01:55.274 --> 1:01:56.909
Can we see it?

1:02:07.920 --> 1:02:11.190
Jamal's been talking about
an alien invasion for years.

1:02:11.223 --> 1:02:13.926
Yeah, that makes sense.

1:02:13.959 --> 1:02:15.928
So tell us more about this door.

1:02:15.961 --> 1:02:17.329
Well, the thing is,

1:02:17.363 --> 1:02:19.565
I found a way to
communicate with this one.

1:02:19.598 --> 1:02:20.700
Oh, you can communicate with it,

1:02:20.734 --> 1:02:23.469
but the government can't even
seem to make contact?

1:02:23.502 --> 1:02:25.604
I'm better than the government.

1:02:25.638 --> 1:02:26.939
Uh, no offense,

1:02:26.972 --> 1:02:28.974
but how are you better than

1:02:29.007 --> 1:02:30.509
billions of dollars
of technology

1:02:30.542 --> 1:02:32.978
and scientific research?

1:02:33.011 --> 1:02:34.513
No offense.

1:02:34.546 --> 1:02:36.115
Just trust me.

1:02:46.058 --> 1:02:48.293
Yeah, so I,

1:02:48.327 --> 1:02:49.228
I could hear it.

1:02:49.261 --> 1:02:52.164
It was talking to me,
like, in my head.

1:02:52.197 --> 1:02:55.167
Wait, you hear voices?

1:02:55.200 --> 1:02:57.970
It's just right up here
around the bend.

1:02:58.003 --> 1:03:00.272
Let me just get this set up.

1:03:15.487 --> 1:03:17.489
Hey, this is Jamal.

1:03:17.523 --> 1:03:19.091
Are you there, friend?

1:03:27.599 --> 1:03:30.068
Careful, these are
really dangerous.

1:03:35.140 --> 1:03:38.210
Hi, Jamal, buddy.

1:03:43.048 --> 1:03:44.651
Yeah!

1:03:44.684 --> 1:03:47.252
Yeah, this is your buddy, Jamal.

1:03:47.286 --> 1:03:49.121
I'm here with
my friend, Cathy,

1:03:49.154 --> 1:03:52.191
I want you to meet
friend Cathy.

1:03:52.224 --> 1:03:56.462
And, and this is Leo.

1:03:56.495 --> 1:04:00.065
What's up, Jamal, buddies?

1:04:05.304 --> 1:04:08.173
- Can I say something to it?
- Of course.

1:04:15.113 --> 1:04:18.116
Hi, I'm Cathy.

1:04:18.150 --> 1:04:21.654
Hello, Cathy, friend.

1:04:31.631 --> 1:04:33.733
Oh, my God!

1:04:38.136 --> 1:04:40.138
What do we call it?

1:04:40.172 --> 1:04:42.341
I don't know,
I never got its name.

1:04:42.374 --> 1:04:44.811
I've just been calling it
friend and buddy.

1:04:44.844 --> 1:04:47.079
My name is

1:04:51.818 --> 1:04:55.320
Um, do you have a nickname?

1:04:55.354 --> 1:04:57.724
Something we can call you?

1:04:57.757 --> 1:05:00.392
Lamaj.

1:05:00.425 --> 1:05:05.765
- Lamaj.
- Lamaj.

1:05:05.798 --> 1:05:08.500
Lamaj is...

1:05:08.534 --> 1:05:10.335
Lamaj, Lamaj is

1:05:10.369 --> 1:05:12.805
- Jamal backwards.
- Jamal.

1:05:15.374 --> 1:05:16.508
Friend.

1:05:19.779 --> 1:05:21.613
Told me yesterday that

1:05:21.648 --> 1:05:22.749
they're here studying us,

1:05:22.782 --> 1:05:26.251
that the doors are
collecting data.

1:05:30.222 --> 1:05:34.593
Maybe this one's
studying friendship.

1:05:41.166 --> 1:05:44.136
Lamaj, why are you here?

1:05:44.169 --> 1:05:47.139
We come to archive.

1:05:47.172 --> 1:05:48.574
Archive what?

1:05:51.143 --> 1:05:52.578
Archive what?

1:05:54.179 --> 1:05:55.581
Humanity.

1:06:13.198 --> 1:06:15.868
This is huge.

1:06:15.902 --> 1:06:19.605
This could be it for us.

1:06:19.639 --> 1:06:22.541
And it could put us on the map.

1:06:22.574 --> 1:06:25.344
Well, how do you mean,
which map?

1:06:25.377 --> 1:06:27.346
Don't you see?

1:06:27.379 --> 1:06:29.381
We can learn the secrets
of the universe

1:06:29.414 --> 1:06:32.785
through what Lamaj knows.

1:06:32.819 --> 1:06:36.789
We can be cosmic explorers
like we always talked about.

1:06:41.493 --> 1:06:42.361
Life can't just be teaching

1:06:42.394 --> 1:06:44.296
a bunch of low-level
astronomy classes

1:06:44.329 --> 1:06:47.299
to kids who don't give a shit.

1:06:47.332 --> 1:06:49.736
Nah, this is huge.

1:06:51.804 --> 1:06:53.906
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

1:06:53.940 --> 1:06:57.609
I just, I think
we should go slow.

1:06:57.644 --> 1:06:59.277
Come on, Jamal.

1:06:59.311 --> 1:07:01.848
Isn't this why you
called me here, for this?

1:07:09.421 --> 1:07:10.723
Okay.

1:07:12.524 --> 1:07:14.192
We can go slow.

1:07:16.628 --> 1:07:19.766
We'll report it
when we're ready.

1:07:19.799 --> 1:07:20.900
When, when we're ready, uh,

1:07:20.933 --> 1:07:24.937
babe, can... babe, can you not
go any closer to that...

1:07:24.971 --> 1:07:27.774
Those doors are murdering
people all over the world!

1:07:27.807 --> 1:07:29.842
All the doors are different,
this door hasn't killed anybody.

1:07:29.876 --> 1:07:31.343
It's just here
to communicate with us.

1:07:31.376 --> 1:07:33.311
Oh, okay, yeah, Jamal.

1:07:33.345 --> 1:07:35.848
I know that you think
you and the door are homies,

1:07:35.882 --> 1:07:38.617
all right, but you
have no fucking clue

1:07:38.651 --> 1:07:39.652
what this thing

1:07:39.686 --> 1:07:41.253
could actually be plotting

1:07:41.286 --> 1:07:43.656
with the rest
of the doors, okay?

1:07:43.690 --> 1:07:46.258
How do you know that we're
not getting poisoned right now

1:07:46.291 --> 1:07:49.294
by some nuclear radiation
from this fucking thing?

1:07:49.327 --> 1:07:54.466
May be, but we can't bury
any attempt with assumptions.

1:07:59.639 --> 1:08:01.573
You have all
the secrets, don't you?

1:08:01.606 --> 1:08:02.809
Okay, look,

1:08:02.842 --> 1:08:04.609
do you guys at least understand

1:08:04.644 --> 1:08:06.679
how many people are
in danger right now?

1:08:06.713 --> 1:08:08.547
Because this thing

1:08:08.580 --> 1:08:10.382
hasn't been quarantined yet?

1:08:10.415 --> 1:08:11.416
Seriously, like, what if,

1:08:11.450 --> 1:08:13.786
- if it liquefies...
- Step away from the door, ma'am!

1:08:13.820 --> 1:08:15.922
Oh, Christ.

1:08:15.955 --> 1:08:17.690
Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to
step away from the the door.

1:08:17.724 --> 1:08:19.025
Oh, for crying out fucking loud.

1:08:19.058 --> 1:08:20.459
Step away from the door!

1:08:20.492 --> 1:08:22.795
Come over here, get away.

1:08:22.829 --> 1:08:23.996
Come on, babe, come on.

1:08:24.030 --> 1:08:27.299
- Holy shit!
- Yeah.

1:08:27.332 --> 1:08:28.835
Leo, this thing's
frickin' huge!

1:08:28.868 --> 1:08:30.737
Leo, did you call the cops?

1:08:30.770 --> 1:08:34.272
Okay, Ricky is a friend.

1:08:34.306 --> 1:08:36.308
Ma'am, ma'am, stop right there.

1:08:36.341 --> 1:08:37.977
- Just stop, okay?
- What she doin'?

1:08:38.010 --> 1:08:39.846
She paces when she's nervous.

1:08:39.879 --> 1:08:40.980
Ma'am, stop right there!

1:08:41.013 --> 1:08:42.514
Stop right there!

1:08:42.547 --> 1:08:44.717
Stop, just you're
making the sheriff nervous...

1:08:44.751 --> 1:08:46.418
Ma'am, stop right now!

1:08:46.451 --> 1:08:48.420
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, Ricky, Ricky.
- You guys are all in violation

1:08:48.453 --> 1:08:51.456
of ordinance 256,
unlawful engagement with a door.

1:08:51.490 --> 1:08:52.859
- Whose property is this?
- It's mine.

1:08:52.892 --> 1:08:54.794
Who are you, step away
from that table, sir!

1:08:54.827 --> 1:08:56.461
Sir, away from the table!

1:08:56.495 --> 1:08:58.296
On your knees, on your knees!

1:08:58.330 --> 1:09:00.599
- Can you just chill with that...
- What is your name? Shut up!

1:09:00.633 --> 1:09:02.034
What is your name, sir?

1:09:02.068 --> 1:09:05.470
Jamal Adkins, buddy.

1:09:07.339 --> 1:09:09.642
The fuckin' door just talk?

1:09:09.675 --> 1:09:11.744
- Absolutely not.
- Yes.

1:09:11.778 --> 1:09:14.412
This is unit 421,
I'm gonna need backup.

1:09:14.446 --> 1:09:15.580
You stay right there, sir.

1:09:15.614 --> 1:09:17.750
- I'm not moving.
- Shut up, shut up!

1:09:17.784 --> 1:09:20.787
- Can you just lower the gun?
- Quit pacin'!

1:09:20.820 --> 1:09:21.988
You stay put!

1:09:22.021 --> 1:09:23.790
- Lamaj.
- Sir, shut up!

1:09:23.823 --> 1:09:24.657
Can you just put the gun down?

1:09:24.690 --> 1:09:26.993
This is 421, I need backup stat,
please.

1:09:27.026 --> 1:09:28.527
Lamaj, a little help please?

1:09:28.560 --> 1:09:29.729
Who you talkin' to?

1:09:29.762 --> 1:09:32.765
This is 421,
I need backup right now!

1:09:32.799 --> 1:09:35.367
- Shut up, you shut up!
- Just calm down.

1:09:35.400 --> 1:09:38.037
I repeat, 421, I need backup.

1:09:38.070 --> 1:09:38.704
Oh, my God, what?

1:09:38.738 --> 1:09:42.541
What the fuck are you doing?

1:09:42.574 --> 1:09:44.010
Holy shit!

1:09:49.048 --> 1:09:50.783
Fuck.

1:09:53.786 --> 1:09:54.921
You!

1:10:32.658 --> 1:10:34.626
Hi, friend.

1:10:37.697 --> 1:10:41.634
It's time to refresh.

1:11:37.522 --> 1:11:38.891
Holy shit, joining
the conversation

1:11:38.925 --> 1:11:40.026
this is a big one, guys.

1:11:40.059 --> 1:11:42.194
All the way from sunny Seattle

1:11:42.228 --> 1:11:44.864
is Parallel Worlds theorist...

1:11:44.897 --> 1:11:46.531
that's one of the show's
favorite magazines,

1:11:46.564 --> 1:11:49.802
by the way... Dr. Alan Price.

1:11:49.835 --> 1:11:52.672
- So good to have you.
- Thank you.

1:11:52.705 --> 1:11:55.041
Yeah, so, uh, Dr. Price,
I'm gonna just jump right in.

1:11:55.074 --> 1:11:59.745
These doors...
you know, what are these things?

1:11:59.779 --> 1:12:02.480
What do they want,
and what's next?

1:12:02.514 --> 1:12:05.583
What do... Talk to me, Alan.

1:12:05.617 --> 1:12:07.987
Well, it's easy to say that
the arrival of the doors

1:12:08.020 --> 1:12:10.522
has changed everything.

1:12:10.555 --> 1:12:11.724
Whether that's missing people,

1:12:11.757 --> 1:12:16.228
or humans returning
cosmically evolved.

1:12:16.262 --> 1:12:18.530
And what I can
tell you for sure is

1:12:18.563 --> 1:12:21.767
it will continue.

1:12:21.801 --> 1:12:23.269
Dr. Price, you're, um,

1:12:23.302 --> 1:12:26.238
you've been
around the doors, right?

1:12:26.272 --> 1:12:28.641
Yes, you can say that.

1:12:28.674 --> 1:12:31.543
So, talk to me,
what do they want?

1:12:31.576 --> 1:12:33.245
You know, what are they?

1:12:33.279 --> 1:12:35.815
They are our
cosmic consciousness.

1:12:38.918 --> 1:12:40.720
Fuck.

1:12:40.753 --> 1:12:44.256
Well, that certainly
passes my weird test, what...

1:12:44.290 --> 1:12:46.959
Can you elaborate a little bit?

1:12:46.993 --> 1:12:50.830
They are a kind of...

1:12:50.863 --> 1:12:56.068
arbiter for existence.

1:12:56.102 --> 1:12:58.204
Arbiter?

1:12:58.237 --> 1:12:59.972
You mean, like a judge?

1:13:00.006 --> 1:13:02.208
No, not at all.

1:13:02.241 --> 1:13:04.210
Their intelligence allows them

1:13:04.243 --> 1:13:08.214
to operate on a complex,
multidimensional reality.

1:13:08.247 --> 1:13:11.050
They are everything all at once.

1:13:11.083 --> 1:13:13.819
We are them, they are us.

1:13:13.853 --> 1:13:15.955
You can even consider them

1:13:15.988 --> 1:13:18.623
God, but more.

1:13:21.027 --> 1:13:23.628
Well, how 'bout that, folks?

1:13:23.662 --> 1:13:26.932
Doors may be God.

1:13:26.966 --> 1:13:28.968
Dr. Price,

1:13:29.001 --> 1:13:32.338
so should we be stockin' up
on toilet paper?

1:13:32.371 --> 1:13:34.340
Should we be dustin' off
our shotguns?

1:13:34.373 --> 1:13:36.675
What do you think?

1:13:36.709 --> 1:13:38.144
I assure you,

1:13:38.177 --> 1:13:41.313
there is nothing
you can do to stop them.

1:13:41.347 --> 1:13:43.115
Nor should you.

1:13:43.149 --> 1:13:47.319
You see, the doors decide
and control everything.

1:13:47.353 --> 1:13:50.289
Their process is quite perfect.

1:13:53.359 --> 1:13:54.960
Uh...

1:13:56.996 --> 1:14:00.733
Dr. Price, you're very
fuckin' weird.

1:14:00.766 --> 1:14:03.636
And I love weird,

1:14:03.669 --> 1:14:06.839
but you're saying
there's nothing we can do?

1:14:06.872 --> 1:14:09.708
Yes, there is.

1:14:09.742 --> 1:14:10.943
Great, like what?

1:14:10.976 --> 1:14:13.345
What do we do?

1:14:13.379 --> 1:14:17.016
Wait to be refreshed.

1:14:17.049 --> 1:14:18.317
Refreshed?

1:14:20.686 --> 1:14:21.921
Like, what are we,

1:14:21.954 --> 1:14:25.024
some kinda web browser?

1:14:29.095 --> 1:14:31.764
Uh, Dr. Price, you're...

1:14:31.797 --> 1:14:34.366
You okay there? Your signal
cut out for a second.

1:14:37.937 --> 1:14:39.238
Accept it.

1:14:41.907 --> 1:14:43.409
Accept what?

1:14:43.442 --> 1:14:45.077
Once the doors

1:14:45.111 --> 1:14:47.780
tether into all of
mankind's consciousness,

1:14:47.813 --> 1:14:51.917
the shift into the next
created reality will ensue.

1:14:51.951 --> 1:14:55.387
We are all awakening.

1:15:07.900 --> 1:15:10.669
Yeah, uh...

1:15:10.703 --> 1:15:14.240
Dr. Price, is it true that

1:15:14.273 --> 1:15:15.808
the people who
come out of the doors

1:15:15.841 --> 1:15:17.042
are altered in some way?

1:15:17.076 --> 1:15:19.411
Can you tell us
a little more about that?

1:15:22.982 --> 1:15:26.018
You know the answer.

1:15:26.051 --> 1:15:27.920
I really don't.

1:15:27.953 --> 1:15:28.988
You tell me.

1:15:29.021 --> 1:15:31.457
This is all a test.

1:15:31.490 --> 1:15:34.293
A way for the doors
to collect information

1:15:34.326 --> 1:15:36.362
in order for them to decide

1:15:36.395 --> 1:15:40.366
what our next re-interpreted
reality will be.

1:15:44.870 --> 1:15:48.407
Dr. Price, have you been
in contact with the doors?

1:15:52.111 --> 1:15:54.079
Accept it, Paul.

1:15:56.849 --> 1:15:58.350
How do you know my name?

1:16:01.921 --> 1:16:05.724
- What the fuck is this?
- What the fuck is this?

1:16:05.758 --> 1:16:07.259
Your memories,

1:16:07.293 --> 1:16:11.163
fears, doubts, desires,

1:16:11.197 --> 1:16:14.066
they all will be absorbed...

1:16:14.099 --> 1:16:16.869
refreshed.

1:16:16.902 --> 1:16:19.004
Do not be afraid.

1:16:21.340 --> 1:16:26.178
- Are the doors telling you this?
- Are the doors telling you this?

1:16:26.212 --> 1:16:28.047
No, Paul.

1:16:28.080 --> 1:16:31.217
I do not speak to the doors.

1:16:31.250 --> 1:16:33.385
I feel them.

1:16:33.419 --> 1:16:36.855
Something the human
species has forgot,

1:16:36.889 --> 1:16:39.959
feeling.

1:16:39.992 --> 1:16:43.796
You, too, have forgotten, Paul.

1:16:43.829 --> 1:16:46.498
In your search to exploit
the events in this world

1:16:46.532 --> 1:16:48.934
so you can feel

1:16:48.968 --> 1:16:50.436
important,

1:16:50.469 --> 1:16:52.805
and in control.

1:16:54.840 --> 1:16:56.442
Does it hurt,

1:16:56.475 --> 1:17:00.346
you hiding behind your image?

1:17:00.379 --> 1:17:03.949
Does it hurt, you using my

1:17:03.983 --> 1:17:05.251
strange behavior

1:17:05.284 --> 1:17:08.420
as entertainment?

1:17:08.454 --> 1:17:10.556
Does it hurt,

1:17:10.589 --> 1:17:15.094
you knowing that you
do not have control right now?

1:17:18.397 --> 1:17:22.134
The process has started.

1:17:22.167 --> 1:17:23.502
Do you feel it?

1:17:26.872 --> 1:17:28.540
Accept it!

1:17:32.978 --> 1:17:34.413
It's already happening.

1:17:44.623 --> 1:17:47.526
Embrace your new reality.

1:18:07.112 --> 1:18:10.949
That's right, accept it.

1:18:10.983 --> 1:18:15.187
Embrace it,
embrace your new reality.

1:18:51.256 --> 1:18:53.225
Welcome.
