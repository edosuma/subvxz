WEBVTT

00:01.060 --> 00:03.502
(soft dramatic music)

00:04.747 --> 00:07.756
(buzzers ringing from afar)

00:16.091 --> 00:18.726
(door rattling)
- It's time.

00:34.593 --> 00:37.036
(rap song)

00:42.043 --> 00:44.543
(loud indistinct chatter)

00:48.791 --> 00:52.051
(squealing)
- Oh, my gosh.

00:52.202 --> 00:53.886
- So you want a bunny?

00:54.037 --> 00:57.056
- We already have a dog.
- Maybe your dog wants a bunny?

00:57.132 --> 00:59.058
- Maybe...

00:59.727 --> 01:00.951
- Yeah.

01:00.953 --> 01:02.227
Um, come on.

01:02.304 --> 01:04.379
- I know, I love you so much.

01:04.398 --> 01:08.358
I'm sorry.
- It's okay. Maybe next time.

01:09.978 --> 01:11.553
- So we have a dog now?

01:11.572 --> 01:13.997
- Yeah. Didn't you know?
- Yeah, no, I didn't.

01:13.999 --> 01:15.407
That was not--
- I had to say something.

01:15.484 --> 01:17.725
'Cause, you know, you were
getting that look on your face

01:17.745 --> 01:19.912
and I was losing
the will to say no.

01:19.988 --> 01:21.638
Plus I'll be the one
looking after it.

01:21.640 --> 01:24.065
- Yeah, you always say that but
I don't think it's true, really.

01:24.085 --> 01:25.733
I'm responsible.
(shouting)

01:25.753 --> 01:28.420
- Are you seeing this?
- Yeah.

01:28.572 --> 01:31.090
(man): White people are
under attack.

01:31.317 --> 01:34.835
The invasion across our borders
by the uneducated,

01:34.911 --> 01:40.432
the unskilled, the hordes
of pathetic people is
unchecked...

01:41.251 --> 01:42.843
(indistinct speech)

01:42.995 --> 01:44.010
- Oh, my God.

01:44.163 --> 01:45.979
(shouting)

01:47.757 --> 01:50.016
Oh, my God, dude,
it's Sunday.

01:50.169 --> 01:52.260
Go to brunch.

01:52.279 --> 01:55.263
(man): Stand your ground.
Stand your ground!

01:55.341 --> 01:57.116
(engine starting)

01:59.120 --> 02:01.528
As long as one white man lives,

02:01.605 --> 02:04.623
all of our land will never be
your land

02:04.700 --> 02:07.442
and you will never replace us.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.795
- Okay, babe, seriously,
can we please go?

02:09.946 --> 02:11.121
Aaliyah!

02:11.781 --> 02:13.023
Please.
- Are you okay?

02:13.116 --> 02:16.042
- No. No, I'm not. Can we go?
- Yes, we can go.

02:16.119 --> 02:17.785
It's okay.

02:17.863 --> 02:20.806
- It's really not.
It's not okay.
- Hey, hey, hey... it's okay.

02:20.883 --> 02:24.384
- No, it's not.
That's why I moved here,
to get away from that.

02:24.461 --> 02:26.145
Can we just...
I just really want to go home.

02:26.296 --> 02:28.054
- You wanna go?
- Yeah, I do.

02:28.207 --> 02:30.207
- Okay, we'll go home.

02:30.209 --> 02:33.735
(tires screeching)
(crowd shouting in fear)

02:52.673 --> 02:54.756
(beeping)

03:05.093 --> 03:07.686
(key rattling in the door)

03:09.748 --> 03:11.765
- Still at it?
- Yeah, I think
I have something.

03:11.841 --> 03:15.085
I'm talking to this guy
who was there at the scene.

03:15.087 --> 03:17.362
- Well, who says he was there.

03:17.589 --> 03:19.180
- Nuh-uh. No.

03:19.258 --> 03:21.033
No. He... he knows things.

03:21.109 --> 03:23.610
Details.
I think he knows the driver.

03:23.762 --> 03:25.996
- Wait, is that you?

03:28.100 --> 03:30.459
White Future?

03:35.457 --> 03:37.365
Do you really think
this is healthy?

03:37.443 --> 03:40.594
Trolling the internet
as a white supremacist?

03:42.965 --> 03:44.297
Sweetie...

03:44.374 --> 03:46.874
you've been at this
for a week now.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.468
It's driving you crazy.

03:48.620 --> 03:50.562
No, the fact that our friend
Jordan is in a body cast

03:50.639 --> 03:53.123
and may never walk again
is driving me crazy.

03:53.125 --> 03:55.959
The police doing nothing,

03:55.961 --> 03:57.461
that's driving me crazy.

03:57.479 --> 04:02.056
And do you wanna know what's
driving me the most crazy?

04:02.634 --> 04:04.726
It's all the people
that were there that day

04:04.803 --> 04:07.320
saying how incensed they are

04:07.397 --> 04:09.706
but not doing a damn thing
about it.

04:17.833 --> 04:19.424
Hey...

04:20.152 --> 04:22.152
I just...

04:22.154 --> 04:24.471
Look, I didn't mean you.

04:25.766 --> 04:28.416
- I'm upset about it too, okay?

04:29.344 --> 04:32.512
I'm not saying that
we ignore it. I just...

04:32.664 --> 04:35.181
I don't want to see you
get swallowed up.

04:35.925 --> 04:38.593
There's no bottom to this,
it's toxic.

04:38.612 --> 04:41.154
I lived with it, I know.

04:42.599 --> 04:45.284
Just being around it
will destroy you.

04:45.360 --> 04:49.413
And now you're in it, 24/7.

04:51.941 --> 04:53.792
(sighs)
- Okay. Alright.

04:53.943 --> 04:55.276
Hey...

04:56.112 --> 05:00.716
Let's just... forget about
all of that for right now, okay?

05:01.527 --> 05:03.393
I'm here.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.470
I'm here with you.

05:09.384 --> 05:13.127
- Uh, maybe you could be like...
here with me.

05:13.147 --> 05:15.981
- Possibly.
(chuckling)

05:17.801 --> 05:19.609
- Oh, my God.

05:21.805 --> 05:24.531
(pop music)

05:26.660 --> 05:29.036
(indistinct PA announcement)

05:30.814 --> 05:33.206
(buzzer ringing)

05:44.403 --> 05:48.421
- Oh, baby,
what's the occasion?

05:48.498 --> 05:50.256
- Um, peace.

05:50.409 --> 05:51.666
- Hmm.

05:51.743 --> 05:53.243
- Has there been a war?

05:53.261 --> 05:55.187
- Uh, you know what I mean.

05:55.414 --> 05:57.931
And look you're not the only one

05:58.083 --> 06:01.526
who's been acting a little crazy
ever since we were almost
run over.

06:02.029 --> 06:05.030
I think I let this stuff
get to me

06:05.257 --> 06:06.681
more than I realized

06:06.700 --> 06:10.494
and I'm really sorry
if I took it out on you.

06:11.947 --> 06:13.538
(beeping)

06:15.117 --> 06:16.766
Is that...?
- I... I'm sorry.

06:16.785 --> 06:20.194
I just, he's... this is when
he said he'd be back online.

06:20.864 --> 06:23.882
- I... I thought you said
you were giving this stuff up?

06:23.959 --> 06:26.109
- I am.
I am.

06:26.111 --> 06:28.795
I just I need
to find the driver.

06:28.872 --> 06:31.056
- Okay. Now...

06:32.300 --> 06:34.041
- What are you...
what are you doing?

06:34.043 --> 06:36.061
- Were you even listening to me?

06:37.881 --> 06:39.639
You know what?
Forget it. Seriously.

06:40.308 --> 06:42.475
- What are you doing?
- I'm going out.

06:42.552 --> 06:44.310
- What? You can't.
- What do you mean I can't.

06:44.463 --> 06:46.405
- Wait, you can't.
Really, hey.

06:46.481 --> 06:48.573
- Yes, I can.
- Wait, wait, wait.

06:48.725 --> 06:50.150
He's here.

06:50.302 --> 06:52.744
- W... who's here?
- Uh, the guy.

06:52.896 --> 06:55.580
Um, the guy
I've been talking to.

06:55.732 --> 06:58.232
- You told him where we live?

06:58.310 --> 07:00.160
- No, I... of course not.

07:00.312 --> 07:02.587
- Well then,
how did he get here?

07:03.424 --> 07:05.632
- I don't know.

07:08.262 --> 07:10.137
(scoffs)

07:14.292 --> 07:17.185
- Is that him?
(beeping)

07:21.442 --> 07:22.666
What'd he say?

07:22.668 --> 07:25.835
(beeping)
- Um, he wants to meet me.

07:25.929 --> 07:29.764
- You can't. He thinks that
you're a white supremacist.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.700
- I know.

07:34.029 --> 07:36.496
I can't meet him...

07:37.440 --> 07:39.166
but you can.

07:41.687 --> 07:44.278
- No.
I'm not doing it.

07:44.356 --> 07:46.965
- Essie, somebody has
to go down there.

07:47.709 --> 07:49.542
Look...

07:49.619 --> 07:52.954
when that guy points his car
towards the crowd,

07:53.031 --> 07:54.864
he's not aiming for you.

07:54.883 --> 07:56.716
He's aiming for me.

07:56.793 --> 07:58.602
People like me.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.646
That guy down there,

08:01.723 --> 08:04.691
I know he was there
and I know he knows things.

08:05.802 --> 08:07.110
Please.

08:07.896 --> 08:09.529
Please, Essie.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.836
- White Future?

08:24.913 --> 08:26.320
- 88?

08:26.398 --> 08:29.065
- I'm sorry for just
showin' up unannounced.

08:29.084 --> 08:30.583
- Yeah well, you should be.

08:30.660 --> 08:32.511
- I didn't mean to scare you,
I just...

08:32.662 --> 08:34.996
I had to make sure you are
who you say you are.

08:36.758 --> 08:40.227
- You're not expecting me
to invite a stranger
up to my apartment, are you?

08:40.687 --> 08:43.980
- I mean, I take exception
to the word stranger.

08:45.341 --> 08:47.767
C'mon let's just
at least grab a drink,

08:47.919 --> 08:50.487
I've come all this way.

08:58.096 --> 08:59.279
(buzzer ringing)

08:59.355 --> 09:01.656
- Alright, let me just...
thank you.

09:02.434 --> 09:04.376
I have got some good news.

09:04.527 --> 09:07.287
The DA came in
with a new settlement offer.

09:07.439 --> 09:10.048
He's willing to take
first-degree murder
off the table

09:10.199 --> 09:11.608
if you plead to second.

09:11.610 --> 09:13.610
But he'll need you
to make a statement.

09:13.612 --> 09:15.720
Just a formal
expression of remorse.

09:15.872 --> 09:17.556
- No.

09:17.707 --> 09:19.616
- Esme.
- No way.

09:19.634 --> 09:21.726
I don't regret what I did.

09:23.121 --> 09:25.955
- Esme, when you get rid
of first degree,

09:25.957 --> 09:29.067
life without the possibility
of parole goes away too.

09:29.144 --> 09:30.643
As your attorney,

09:30.796 --> 09:34.531
I strongly recommend that you
give this some serious thought.

09:36.818 --> 09:39.226
- There's nothing
to think about.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.496
- Esme, are you sure?

09:43.083 --> 09:45.125
- I'm sure.

09:47.403 --> 09:48.962
Okay...

09:49.648 --> 09:51.481
Well, put this on.

09:51.499 --> 09:54.426
Your trial starts
in a half an hour.

09:57.839 --> 09:59.472
(buzzer ringing)

09:59.933 --> 10:01.725
Thank you.

10:03.495 --> 10:06.062
(theme music)

10:19.010 --> 10:20.785
(hard rock music)

10:20.937 --> 10:22.436
- I'm sorry if I spooked you.

10:22.530 --> 10:25.648
I just, I thought you were kinda
pushing for us to get together.

10:26.034 --> 10:27.867
- Maybe I was.

10:28.795 --> 10:31.278
So did you uh,
track my IP address?

10:31.373 --> 10:34.448
- Well, I half expected you
to be a cop.

10:34.468 --> 10:36.468
It all seemed
too good to be true.

10:36.544 --> 10:37.952
- Then why'd you come?

10:38.029 --> 10:39.971
- Guess I had a hunch
you'd be worth it.

10:40.048 --> 10:43.058
Hell, what are the odds, right?

10:44.978 --> 10:46.728
"Holy Waters?"

10:48.464 --> 10:50.131
- The Bible Camp.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.725
- Concentration camp,
if you ask me.

10:53.561 --> 10:56.988
Yeah, I can't believe
I told you I went there.

10:57.140 --> 10:59.115
- It's a small world, huh?

10:59.901 --> 11:01.809
It feels kinda cosmic.

11:01.887 --> 11:03.403
The two of us.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.814
- You think you're
pretty charming, don't you?

11:06.833 --> 11:08.333
- Is it working?

11:08.484 --> 11:10.627
(chuckles)

11:12.397 --> 11:16.749
So tell me... what's a girl
like you even doing here?

11:16.902 --> 11:18.735
- Making a living.

11:18.753 --> 11:20.327
- Yeah, but how do you stand it?

11:20.405 --> 11:22.681
You know, the smell of 'em.
- Hmm...

11:22.832 --> 11:26.576
- Just walking down the street,
they leave a residue.

11:26.594 --> 11:30.689
- Yeah, I mean "If it's brown,
flush it down" right?

11:30.765 --> 11:33.266
My daddy had that
on his bumper.

11:33.342 --> 11:35.694
Back when we were allowed
to have free speech.

11:35.845 --> 11:37.696
- Amen.
(chuckles)

11:37.772 --> 11:39.422
(bottles tinkling)

11:40.701 --> 11:45.352
- You know, I, um...
I have to admit I was
a little bit jealous.

11:45.430 --> 11:47.096
- Of?

11:47.098 --> 11:50.625
- Well, you were there
when it happened.

11:52.270 --> 11:54.754
Driver a friend of yours?

11:55.774 --> 11:56.773
- Maybe.

11:56.791 --> 11:59.884
- Or maybe you are being modest.

12:00.628 --> 12:03.096
- The truth?
- Mm-hmm.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.615
I don't think it was worth it.

12:05.633 --> 12:08.509
All that heat, over what?
A drop in the bucket.

12:09.563 --> 12:12.605
We've got somethin'
much bigger planned.

12:13.308 --> 12:15.308
- Oh yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

12:15.460 --> 12:17.885
What do you say
I get us another round?

12:17.963 --> 12:19.696
- Yeah.

12:30.751 --> 12:34.477
(door opening)
You know you really could have
warned me?

12:34.479 --> 12:37.905
- There wasn't any time. I just,
everything happened so fast.

12:37.924 --> 12:39.573
- He knew everything about me.

12:39.651 --> 12:42.260
You used my whole life.
- Essie, I'm sorry.

12:42.337 --> 12:44.929
I'm so sorry.
Really, I...

12:45.932 --> 12:48.508
Look, I only did it because
I needed him to trust me.

12:48.584 --> 12:50.727
I'm sorry, Essie.

12:51.997 --> 12:54.013
Are you okay?

12:54.165 --> 12:56.149
- I'm calling the police.

12:59.521 --> 13:01.270
- So that's him?

13:02.431 --> 13:04.115
- And he says he's planning
something else.

13:04.192 --> 13:06.534
Something big.

13:09.105 --> 13:11.105
- So what's his name?

13:11.124 --> 13:14.017
- Uh, 88 is his handle. 88.

13:14.019 --> 13:15.518
- 88?

13:15.537 --> 13:18.704
You sat with this guy how long
and you didn't get his name?

13:18.857 --> 13:22.300
- No, if I had asked him he
would have gotten up and left.

13:23.303 --> 13:26.287
Look, he's dangerous.
I know him.

13:26.364 --> 13:28.548
I mean, not him specifically

13:28.550 --> 13:32.459
but we went to the same bible
camp and he says he knows the
driver who ran down our friend.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.871
- I mean, he may even be
the driver.

13:34.964 --> 13:36.297
- Yeah.

13:36.316 --> 13:39.225
- He knows things like
the cracked windshield.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.229
- Maybe he watched the video.
A lot of people did.

13:43.306 --> 13:45.472
Look, look, look, he says
he lives upstate

13:45.567 --> 13:48.267
with some people at a compound,
or a farm or something.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.810
We think that's
where the car is.

13:49.830 --> 13:52.163
- And you want me to drop
everything and track him down

13:52.315 --> 13:54.207
for meeting you at a bar.

13:55.393 --> 13:57.318
- You're not going to do
anything, are you?

13:57.337 --> 13:59.987
- What I am gonna do is tell you
to stop playing detective.

14:00.065 --> 14:01.488
- I'm not playing!

14:01.566 --> 14:03.399
- Anything comes up,
we'll let you know, okay?

14:03.418 --> 14:07.095
In the meantime,
let us do our job, okay?

14:09.924 --> 14:13.017
(door closing)
- He's not gonna do anything.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.913
- Yeah, well...

14:17.415 --> 14:20.358
it's kinda how it goes,
isn't it?

14:21.027 --> 14:23.753
But hey, you were right.

14:24.439 --> 14:27.699
I never should have invited
that guy into our lives.

14:29.094 --> 14:32.036
I'm sorry I put you
in that position, okay?

14:32.764 --> 14:35.081
Look, let's just drop it now.

14:35.934 --> 14:37.625
Yeah?

14:56.396 --> 14:58.212
- Hey, you okay?

14:58.289 --> 15:00.565
- Yeah.
- Okay.

15:01.292 --> 15:02.734
(man): All rise.

15:02.885 --> 15:06.145
Department Seventy
of the Superior Court is now
in session,

15:06.297 --> 15:08.740
Judge Morse presiding.

15:15.916 --> 15:17.999
- What are you doing?

15:19.160 --> 15:22.003
- I've been talking to him.

15:23.498 --> 15:25.148
- Are you serious?

15:25.150 --> 15:26.925
Uh... Essie.

15:27.076 --> 15:30.678
- He invited me upstate
to their compound where he lives
with those people.

15:33.508 --> 15:34.674
- You...

15:34.993 --> 15:37.251
But you're not actually
thinking about going, right?

15:37.328 --> 15:38.661
- It's like you said.

15:38.754 --> 15:41.105
Everyone's so mad about it
but nobody's doing anything.

15:41.182 --> 15:44.684
And now they're planning
on doing something else
and the cops won't get involved.

15:44.760 --> 15:46.185
I can't...
I can't let that happen.

15:46.337 --> 15:49.839
- Essie...
- Listen, listen to me, baby.

15:49.857 --> 15:51.841
(Essie sighs.)

15:51.843 --> 15:53.526
When I was a kid...

15:54.437 --> 15:57.196
I was riding with my brother
Charlie

15:57.290 --> 16:00.166
and there was this black kid
on the corner.

16:02.036 --> 16:03.628
Charlie just...

16:03.705 --> 16:06.089
threw a bottle at his head.

16:07.525 --> 16:10.784
The kid screamed,
charged at us,

16:10.862 --> 16:14.514
he didn't know there was a truck
full of Charlie's buddies
right behind us.

16:17.202 --> 16:19.143
They all got out and...

16:19.220 --> 16:21.562
started kicking
the hell outta him.

16:22.298 --> 16:24.207
And he was screaming.

16:24.559 --> 16:28.444
And there was...
blood all over the street.

16:31.065 --> 16:33.324
And you know what I did?

16:36.329 --> 16:38.037
Nothing.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.540
I just watched.

16:43.077 --> 16:45.086
- You were a kid.

16:45.913 --> 16:47.839
- But I'm not anymore.

16:47.915 --> 16:49.398
- Essie...

16:49.417 --> 16:52.552
please, you cannot go with him.

16:53.254 --> 16:55.638
- I already said yes.

16:56.332 --> 16:58.224
(beeping)

17:08.419 --> 17:10.194
He's here.

17:12.273 --> 17:14.924
- Okay.
- But what are you doing?

17:14.926 --> 17:16.200
- No, no, no. No, no.

17:16.352 --> 17:18.110
- I'm gonna show him who
he's really been talking to.

17:18.187 --> 17:19.871
- So then what?
So then you get killed?

17:20.022 --> 17:21.781
And they get away with it?

17:21.933 --> 17:23.708
Listen to me,

17:23.859 --> 17:26.360
Okay? My whole life,

17:26.379 --> 17:31.332
I thought I was brave
for getting out but I wasn't.

17:31.367 --> 17:34.443
I was always just running.

17:34.462 --> 17:36.763
Scared. Always.

17:37.632 --> 17:39.599
And I'm sick of it.

17:42.062 --> 17:44.062
I love you.

17:46.140 --> 17:48.066
I love you, okay?

17:48.068 --> 17:51.611
I need to go.
- No, please don't go.

17:52.555 --> 17:54.238
- I need to go, okay?

17:54.465 --> 17:57.366
Look, look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

18:10.481 --> 18:12.757
Oh. Okay.

18:12.908 --> 18:14.759
- Don't be shy.

18:14.986 --> 18:16.485
Your boyfriend sent me.

18:16.504 --> 18:20.172
- Uh, he's not my boyfriend.
I don't even know his name.

18:20.249 --> 18:23.017
- And I don't know your name.

18:24.345 --> 18:26.086
- I'm Esme.

18:26.106 --> 18:27.772
People call me Essie.

18:28.666 --> 18:30.942
- Isn't that what Mexicans
call each other?

18:31.018 --> 18:33.927
- No, I think that's Ess-ay.

18:33.947 --> 18:35.521
- I'm messing with you.

18:35.598 --> 18:39.075
But the question is,
are you messing with me?

18:41.103 --> 18:42.620
- What's that supposed to mean?

18:42.697 --> 18:45.790
- It means my boy comes back
from the big city

18:45.941 --> 18:48.942
smitten with some girl
who shows up out of nowhere.

18:49.629 --> 18:52.112
- I didn't know
he was anyone's boy.

18:52.132 --> 18:54.781
- You're good at that,
aren't you?

18:54.801 --> 18:57.618
- At what?
- Changing the subject.

18:57.637 --> 19:00.304
- I'm not really sure
what the subject is?

19:00.381 --> 19:02.031
- You.

19:02.049 --> 19:03.366
You know what they say?

19:03.459 --> 19:05.476
You go to somebody,
chances are you can trust them.

19:05.628 --> 19:08.813
But if someone comes to you,
better beware.

19:08.964 --> 19:12.224
Right, right. Well,
that's the thing,
he actually, um...

19:12.301 --> 19:14.226
he actually came to me.

19:14.303 --> 19:16.045
He showed up at my doorstep
unannounced,

19:16.063 --> 19:18.322
which, to be honest,
is pretty creepy.

19:18.474 --> 19:21.159
So maybe I should be
the one grilling you.

19:24.572 --> 19:27.039
- Come on, get in.

19:29.727 --> 19:32.628
You comin' or not?
I don't have all day.
- Uh...

19:38.569 --> 19:43.097
(engine starting)
(knocking on the window)

20:04.779 --> 20:05.661
(keys rattling)

20:35.142 --> 20:37.293
- Something you want to say?

20:37.295 --> 20:39.478
- You look familiar.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.656
- I don't see how.

20:45.060 --> 20:46.702
- Hey.

20:50.899 --> 20:53.167
- I'll leave you to it.

20:59.667 --> 21:02.075
- You want to tell me
what that was all about?

21:02.095 --> 21:03.319
- You mad at me?

21:03.321 --> 21:06.171
I'm sorry, he's paranoid.

21:07.008 --> 21:09.725
It's the only way I'd ever get
to see you again.

21:14.332 --> 21:16.691
- What's his deal, anyway?

21:18.444 --> 21:21.988
- C'mon.
I want you to meet some people.

21:25.860 --> 21:28.193
You comin'?
- Yeah.

21:29.680 --> 21:35.793
- This case isn't about peaceful
protest or civil disobedience.

21:35.944 --> 21:38.713
It's...
(sudden hubbub)

21:41.359 --> 21:42.858
- Move!
- Thank you.

21:42.860 --> 21:46.119
Just a minute, counselor.
(gavel banging)
Order!

21:46.197 --> 21:47.788
- You're in my spot.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.865
(gavel banging)
Order in this court!

21:49.884 --> 21:54.294
Now this is a public trial,
you are allowed to be here.

21:54.314 --> 21:57.148
But I will not tolerate
any further disruption.

21:57.375 --> 21:59.483
Do you recognize any of them?

21:59.635 --> 22:01.393
- No.
(man): What's your problem?

22:01.470 --> 22:04.030
- Please continue, counselor.

22:05.232 --> 22:07.900
- This case is about violence,

22:08.052 --> 22:11.037
lethal violence.

22:16.652 --> 22:18.669
(admirative whistling)

22:19.839 --> 22:21.672
- I told you.
She's perfect.

22:21.824 --> 22:24.157
- Yeah, where'd you learn
to shoot like that?

22:24.235 --> 22:26.251
Oh, um, Quantico.

22:26.404 --> 22:28.012
- What?

22:28.163 --> 22:30.664
- East Tennessee.

22:30.683 --> 22:34.760
- So you two just old friends
from there?

22:34.912 --> 22:38.171
- Uh, no, not really.
- Where then?

22:38.265 --> 22:41.192
- Uh, well, it was after
the "incident" in Brooklyn.

22:41.343 --> 22:43.677
The hysteria down there
was off the charts.

22:43.738 --> 22:47.365
Everyone screaming about the
violence, and the violence.

22:47.441 --> 22:50.034
The violence they brought on
themselves by the way.

22:50.761 --> 22:54.613
It was making me crazy
so I was in need of
some adult conversation

22:54.765 --> 22:59.126
and uh, miraculously
this gentleman appeared.

22:59.954 --> 23:01.879
- Why do you live there?

23:02.698 --> 23:05.049
- Not everyone can live here
in Valhalla.

23:05.126 --> 23:06.366
- Yeah, good point.

23:06.386 --> 23:09.202
If everyone from there
lived here,

23:09.280 --> 23:11.705
it wouldn't be Valhalla,
would it?

23:12.299 --> 23:14.875
- Well, there's something
you can't say out loud, right?

23:14.952 --> 23:15.968
- Why not?

23:16.044 --> 23:19.138
I don't mind the blacks,
I love 'em.

23:19.232 --> 23:22.048
As long as they're in Africa.

23:22.068 --> 23:24.126
Mexicans in Mexico.

23:24.219 --> 23:25.978
Jews in Israel.

23:26.072 --> 23:28.464
Let them have
their so-called culture,

23:28.482 --> 23:31.409
just don't come here
and mess up ours.

23:32.078 --> 23:35.137
And now suddenly
we're the terrorists?

23:35.156 --> 23:37.489
We're the illegals?
(chuckles dryly)

23:37.566 --> 23:39.992
What's happening here,
on our land,

23:40.068 --> 23:42.068
this replacement,

23:42.146 --> 23:43.479
if it was happenin'
anywhere else,

23:43.572 --> 23:46.072
to anyone else
but white Americans,

23:46.150 --> 23:47.942
you know what they'd call it...

23:47.944 --> 23:49.367
they'd call it genocide.

23:49.429 --> 23:52.655
So anything that we do
in response,

23:52.657 --> 23:55.248
that's called self-defense.

23:55.268 --> 23:58.510
(Essie): Yeah.
- What are you clowns doin'?

23:58.587 --> 24:00.179
- Tryin' to make the world
a better place.

24:00.331 --> 24:01.939
- C'mon.
I need your help.

24:02.090 --> 24:03.941
- Now?
- No, tomorrow.

24:04.018 --> 24:05.851
What's with the questions?

24:06.003 --> 24:07.761
- Sorry.
- What's up?

24:07.780 --> 24:09.572
- Nothing.

24:10.524 --> 24:11.857
(man whistling)

24:12.601 --> 24:16.120
Actually, uh...
we might be awhile.

24:16.197 --> 24:17.938
We got something in the works.

24:17.990 --> 24:20.541
(whispering): Something big...

24:24.355 --> 24:27.189
- Don't worry.
He'll be back.

24:27.191 --> 24:29.358
(chuckles)
- So what are they up to?

24:29.376 --> 24:32.094
He said they're
working on something?

24:32.972 --> 24:34.880
- A little surprise party.

24:35.032 --> 24:36.682
- Uh...

24:40.128 --> 24:41.795
Um, I've got to pee.

24:41.814 --> 24:44.631
- Just past the kitchen.
On the left.

24:44.709 --> 24:45.816
- Great.

24:45.968 --> 24:48.527
(door opening)

24:55.736 --> 24:58.579
(soft music)

25:57.965 --> 26:00.140
(exhales)

26:02.562 --> 26:05.062
(phone buzzing)

26:08.568 --> 26:10.067
- Hey.

26:10.218 --> 26:12.444
- What're you doing here?

26:15.223 --> 26:17.408
You know what? Don't.

26:18.803 --> 26:20.226
- Esme?

26:20.246 --> 26:22.746
- I knew I recognized you.

26:25.585 --> 26:27.142
Give me your phone.

26:27.161 --> 26:29.645
- I don't want to.

26:29.663 --> 26:32.464
- Give me your phone.

26:38.172 --> 26:40.180
What's the passcode?

26:41.992 --> 26:45.144
Punch in the passcode.

26:48.833 --> 26:50.423
Do it yourself.

26:50.443 --> 26:53.018
- Punch in the code!
(Esme panting)

26:53.095 --> 26:55.487
- Okay. Okay.

27:05.199 --> 27:07.458
- You disgust me.

27:13.115 --> 27:15.591
(crashing)

27:22.642 --> 27:27.035
She said she was worried
when you got disconnected,
but not anymore.

27:27.037 --> 27:30.389
(chuckles)
Ah, she sent an emoji,

27:30.541 --> 27:34.209
a black girl and a white girl
with a heart in between them.

27:34.211 --> 27:37.546
(Esme crying)
That's exactly what's wrong
with the world right there.

27:38.491 --> 27:41.307
(phone beeps)
Now she's said "be careful"

27:41.327 --> 27:43.886
and I'm going to respond.

27:43.904 --> 27:45.570
Thumbs up.

27:45.665 --> 27:47.239
Pink heart.
Purple heart.

27:47.315 --> 27:50.058
Is there an emoji
for "race traitor"? Hmm?

27:50.060 --> 27:52.169
There should be.

27:54.322 --> 27:56.415
- What are we going
to do with her?

27:56.567 --> 27:58.567
Not a lot of options, now,
are there?

27:58.585 --> 28:01.345
- I won't tell anyone. I swear.
- And why would we believe you?

28:01.422 --> 28:04.072
You've done nothing but lie.
(crying)

28:04.091 --> 28:05.924
You know how I recognized her?

28:06.076 --> 28:07.409
It's from that day.

28:07.428 --> 28:11.355
White citizens peaceably
expressing their concern

28:11.432 --> 28:13.173
for what this nation has become.

28:13.250 --> 28:14.858
And what happens next?

28:15.361 --> 28:19.755
A bunch of mulattoes show up
and shout them down.

28:20.774 --> 28:24.368
Same thing that's happened
in this whole damn state,
this whole damn country.

28:24.519 --> 28:26.762
Them taking over,

28:26.780 --> 28:30.615
telling my people to shut up
and get lost.

28:32.119 --> 28:35.921
And you know what I see
in the middle of this
godforsaken mud ballet?

28:37.199 --> 28:41.293
A white girl, kissing up
on her black girlfriend,

28:41.445 --> 28:43.779
and you know who that was?

28:43.797 --> 28:45.556
You.
(crying): No...!

28:45.707 --> 28:49.284
And seeing you,
I couldn't stand it anymore.

28:49.303 --> 28:51.787
So I started my engine.

28:52.398 --> 28:55.290
And you know
what happened next.

28:55.292 --> 28:57.550
- No, please.
I won't tell anyone.

28:57.570 --> 28:59.962
I won't say a word.
Please, please.

28:59.980 --> 29:01.221
- You got that right.

29:01.223 --> 29:02.406
- Dude, you kill a white girl

29:02.557 --> 29:04.057
and the feds will be
all over us.

29:04.151 --> 29:08.078
- You got a lot of faith
in our law enforcement
all of a sudden.

29:08.230 --> 29:10.063
- I swear. I swear.
Please, please.

29:10.140 --> 29:13.308
- She doesn't know our names,
we can just leave her here
and get lost.

29:13.310 --> 29:15.978
- She likes girls,
you get that, right?

29:15.996 --> 29:18.589
- We've got enough heat on us
as it is, thanks to you.

29:18.740 --> 29:19.831
- Thanks to me?
- Yeah.

29:19.908 --> 29:21.483
- You're the moron
who brought her here,

29:21.485 --> 29:24.911
so unless you want to man up
and take care of this,

29:24.930 --> 29:26.430
get outta my face.

29:26.432 --> 29:30.434
(Esme, panting): No.
Please, please, please.

29:31.145 --> 29:34.062
(groaning)
(rod tinkling)

29:37.960 --> 29:40.360
(Esme whimpering)

29:43.098 --> 29:45.407
(ripping sound)
- Ah!

29:46.786 --> 29:48.786
Ah, no, no!

29:48.937 --> 29:50.621
- The car! Go!

29:54.852 --> 29:56.710
(panting)

29:58.464 --> 30:00.022
(crashing)

30:00.040 --> 30:02.591
(engine starting)

30:11.535 --> 30:14.061
(phone buzzing)

30:15.130 --> 30:16.462
- Hey, baby.

30:16.540 --> 30:18.965
<i>I've been worried. Are you okay?</i>
- I have the car,

30:18.984 --> 30:20.425
the one that hit Jordan.
- What?

30:20.502 --> 30:22.878
<i> - I'm driving it now.</i>
- Where are you?

30:22.896 --> 30:24.988
- Upstate, near Arden.

30:25.065 --> 30:26.398
Uh, the driver's there.

30:26.492 --> 30:29.051
It's a farm with a white house
and two barns.

30:29.053 --> 30:30.661
- Essie, are you okay?

30:30.812 --> 30:33.388
The FBI and the police
need to get there,
so you need to call them.

30:33.407 --> 30:35.557
<i> - Alright.</i>
<i> It's going to be okay.</i>

30:35.559 --> 30:37.960
- He tried to kill me.

30:43.567 --> 30:47.419
- The People call
Aaliyah Williams to the stand.

30:47.571 --> 30:50.597
(men cough and boo)

30:53.243 --> 30:55.853
- I will have order
in this court!

30:56.004 --> 30:59.748
I repeat, I will have order
in this court.

30:59.750 --> 31:02.359
Bailiff, remove these people.
(coughing continues)

31:02.510 --> 31:05.404
Bailiff, clear the court!
(gavel banging)

31:06.031 --> 31:09.074
(struggling sounds)

31:12.872 --> 31:14.746
(soft music)

31:19.027 --> 31:21.753
(sirens wailing)

31:34.451 --> 31:36.727
(panting)

31:38.397 --> 31:40.138
(Esme crying)

31:40.215 --> 31:42.357
- It's okay. It's okay.

31:56.323 --> 31:59.124
It's okay.
I'm right here.

32:06.574 --> 32:08.634
- Everybody back!

32:30.598 --> 32:33.024
- They're almost done.

32:33.101 --> 32:34.618
- Did they find anything?

32:34.769 --> 32:37.012
- No, it didn't sound like it.

32:37.790 --> 32:41.792
Apparently the owner is
some old guy in a nursing home
in New Jersey.

32:41.868 --> 32:43.276
- What?

32:43.295 --> 32:46.129
He didn't even know
anyone was living here.

32:49.359 --> 32:51.359
You cannot blame yourself
for what happened.

32:51.361 --> 32:53.804
- Who else is there to blame?

32:53.880 --> 32:55.621
- I mean...

32:56.049 --> 32:58.366
I started this whole thing.
- No.

32:58.385 --> 33:00.869
- I feel like I got us
into this.

33:00.887 --> 33:03.105
- No, it's not the same.

33:04.374 --> 33:07.375
(mumbling nervously)
Do they have any ideas?

33:07.394 --> 33:10.212
Like where to find these people?
Or where they might have gone?

33:10.230 --> 33:12.805
Or...
anything at all?

33:13.734 --> 33:15.808
- They said they think
they're from out of state.

33:15.886 --> 33:17.518
- Wait, wait... what?
If they're...

33:17.663 --> 33:19.904
okay, if they're
from out of state, how did
they know about this place?

33:19.999 --> 33:22.741
- I don't know.
- How did they know
that nobody was living here?

33:22.743 --> 33:26.336
How did they know to set me up?
- I don't know Esme.

33:27.898 --> 33:31.675
We really need to just let
the police do their thing now.

33:31.752 --> 33:33.510
Okay?

33:36.015 --> 33:38.098
Let's go home.

33:40.927 --> 33:42.427
- Yeah.

33:43.188 --> 33:46.064
Yeah, um, I'll be up there
in a minute, okay?

33:47.934 --> 33:49.693
- Alright.

34:21.209 --> 34:23.435
(camera clicking)

34:36.133 --> 34:37.240
<i> (Esme): Hi.</i>

34:37.317 --> 34:39.317
- Hey, baby.
Where are you?

34:39.469 --> 34:41.244
I, I just woke up
and you're gone.

34:41.321 --> 34:43.747
- I just needed to get some air.

34:43.898 --> 34:45.156
- That sounds good.

34:45.233 --> 34:47.584
I'll come join you.
<i> - No, I...</i>

34:47.694 --> 34:51.646
Look, I-I just think
that I need some space.

34:52.424 --> 34:54.482
- You really shouldn't be alone
right now, Essie.

34:54.484 --> 34:57.243
I'm... I'm driving down
to Philly, okay?

34:58.097 --> 35:01.080
<i> I'm just gonna stay</i>
<i> with a friend for a few days.</i>

35:01.158 --> 35:02.657
- What friend?

35:02.659 --> 35:04.417
- Lauren.

35:04.436 --> 35:08.146
Her and her husband
just bought a new house so...

35:09.924 --> 35:12.851
<i> - Essie, I get it, okay?</i>
<i> I get it.</i>

35:12.927 --> 35:15.503
<i> You have every right</i>
<i> to be upset with me...</i>

35:15.505 --> 35:18.022
- I'm not, I'm not...
I'm not mad at you.

35:18.099 --> 35:19.449
I'm not.
I just...

35:19.601 --> 35:24.487
I... I just need a few days,
okay?

35:25.349 --> 35:27.440
I'll call you soon, I promise.

35:27.459 --> 35:29.209
I love you.

35:29.870 --> 35:31.586
- I love you too.

35:42.199 --> 35:45.058
(phone ringing)

35:49.890 --> 35:51.356
- Hey.

35:51.799 --> 35:53.041
Aaliyah?

35:53.059 --> 35:55.527
- You lied to me.

35:56.897 --> 35:58.137
<i> You're not with Lauren.</i>

35:58.157 --> 35:59.714
I actually found Lauren
on Facebook.

35:59.716 --> 36:03.743
So um... do you want to tell me
where you really are?

36:05.238 --> 36:07.405
- I-I just need some space.

36:07.557 --> 36:09.499
That's all.

36:11.336 --> 36:12.836
- Are we okay?

36:13.063 --> 36:14.412
<i> What is going on? I...</i>

36:14.564 --> 36:16.915
<i>(Esme): We're fine, we're fine.</i>

36:17.067 --> 36:18.750
<i> I promise, okay.</i>

36:18.844 --> 36:20.594
<i> We're fine.</i>

36:21.254 --> 36:23.405
- I love you, Essie.

36:23.998 --> 36:26.558
<i> I mean, you know that, right?</i>

36:28.929 --> 36:31.062
(phone ringing)

36:34.526 --> 36:36.100
<i> (Aaliyah): Essie?</i>

36:36.695 --> 36:39.771
Essie, I've been calling you
for two days.

36:39.847 --> 36:41.589
It's been two days.

36:41.591 --> 36:44.426
<i> You're looking for them,</i>
<i> aren't you?</i>

36:44.444 --> 36:47.746
<i>What is it that you think you're</i>
<i> gonna do when you find them?</i>

36:49.266 --> 36:51.583
<i> Hmm?</i>
<i> What are you going to do?</i>

36:54.046 --> 36:56.120
I want to come help you, okay?

36:56.197 --> 36:58.548
- No, I don't want you involved.

36:58.700 --> 37:01.718
- Well, I already am involved.

37:02.704 --> 37:06.130
<i> I'm involved.</i>
<i> So you need to talk to me.</i>

37:06.283 --> 37:08.450
You need to tell me
where you are.

37:08.468 --> 37:10.952
Please, Essie, can you just...

37:10.954 --> 37:12.979
- I'm in a car.

37:13.473 --> 37:14.973
In the rain.

37:15.809 --> 37:20.487
<i>- Essie, you're really starting</i>
<i> to scare me now, okay?</i>

37:21.631 --> 37:25.492
Can you... can you please
come home?

37:27.228 --> 37:29.996
<i> Please don't do this</i>
<i> right now, please.</i>

37:30.974 --> 37:34.209
(thunder rumbling)

37:44.821 --> 37:47.514
(somber music)

38:10.363 --> 38:12.405
Yeah, just give me
six boxes of the 38s.

38:12.440 --> 38:14.291
- Yeah.
- Four boxes of the 45s.

38:14.293 --> 38:16.793
- Alright. 45s?
- Yeah.

38:17.020 --> 38:18.353
Okay, wrap it up?

38:18.355 --> 38:20.630
- Yeah, pack it up.
(phone buzzing)

38:23.360 --> 38:25.218
- Essie?

38:26.530 --> 38:28.029
- I see them.

38:28.048 --> 38:29.973
<i> - What?</i>

38:30.050 --> 38:33.959
Okay, um... I'm gonna, I'm gonna
call the police, okay?

38:33.961 --> 38:36.387
<i> - They won't do anything.</i>
<i> They never do.</i>

38:36.464 --> 38:39.649
- Then just go. Just go.
You can just go right now.

38:39.726 --> 38:42.393
<i> You need to get out of there,</i>
<i> right now.</i>

38:42.470 --> 38:45.638
- I can't.
I can't let them get away.

38:45.715 --> 38:48.066
- You don't have to do this.
You don't.

38:48.142 --> 38:49.884
You left these people when
you were 15.

38:49.977 --> 38:52.495
<i> You got on a bus to New York.</i>
<i> You didn't know anyone</i>
<i> in New York</i>

38:52.647 --> 38:55.314
<i> and then you,</i>
<i> by some miracle, you found me.</i>

38:55.392 --> 38:58.501
<i> You, you, you left all of that</i>
<i> stuff behind</i>

38:58.653 --> 39:01.896
and then I pushed you
back into it.
(crying)

39:01.915 --> 39:03.915
<i> - You didn't push me back</i>
<i> into it.</i>

39:04.067 --> 39:05.175
<i> It never left me.</i>

39:05.326 --> 39:07.919
I've been carrying it with me
this whole time.

39:08.071 --> 39:10.088
<i> Essie.</i>

39:10.240 --> 39:12.682
- I love you.

39:12.792 --> 39:14.333
<i> - Essie?</i>

39:14.411 --> 39:15.643
Essie!

39:21.843 --> 39:24.486
(tires screeching)

39:37.692 --> 39:40.768
- So you were on the phone
with her when it happened.

39:40.862 --> 39:42.361
- Mm-hmm.

39:42.381 --> 39:45.757
- Uh, for the record,
was that a yes or a no?

39:46.534 --> 39:47.867
- Yes.

39:48.128 --> 39:51.129
- According to the phone records
you had been on the phone
with her

39:51.281 --> 39:53.965
for nearly four minutes.

39:53.967 --> 39:56.059
Does that sound right?

39:57.044 --> 39:59.454
- I... yeah, I guess so.

39:59.472 --> 40:01.046
- And during that time,

40:01.307 --> 40:05.527
did the defendant relate to you
what she planned
to do to the victims?

40:07.555 --> 40:09.221
- They weren't victims.

40:09.241 --> 40:12.492
- To the deceased then.

40:15.914 --> 40:18.581
Would you like me
to repeat the question?

40:20.735 --> 40:22.377
Ms. Williams?

40:23.755 --> 40:25.404
- Ms. Williams.

40:25.482 --> 40:27.573
You will answer the question.

40:27.592 --> 40:31.136
Did the defendant relate to you
what she planned to do?

40:32.656 --> 40:35.598
Ms. Williams, you will answer
the question

40:35.675 --> 40:37.267
or I will find you in contempt,

40:37.343 --> 40:40.728
and you'll both be behind bars,
do you understand?

40:43.833 --> 40:46.258
Ms. Williams,
you're leaving me no choice.

40:46.278 --> 40:48.093
The court instructs
the bailiff to--

40:48.113 --> 40:50.029
- She said...

40:51.858 --> 40:54.451
She said, "I see them."

40:55.787 --> 40:58.288
"I see the two men who ran us
down in the street."

40:58.439 --> 41:00.515
- Your Honor, the victims are
not the ones on trial here.

41:00.533 --> 41:02.608
- "I see the two men who killed
innocent people with a bomb

41:02.686 --> 41:04.443
they were too cowardly
to deliver themselves."

41:04.463 --> 41:06.629
- Move to strike.
- She said,

41:06.781 --> 41:07.797
"I see them."

41:08.191 --> 41:11.342
- Ms. Williams. I remind you
that you are under oath.

41:12.971 --> 41:14.721
- Yeah.

41:16.382 --> 41:18.725
Yeah, you don't need
to remind me.

41:20.645 --> 41:23.730
Don't need to remind me
where I am right now.

41:30.730 --> 41:32.489
Baby...

41:34.234 --> 41:36.576
Let's go home, Essie.

41:39.556 --> 41:41.456
Let's go home.

41:43.835 --> 41:46.753
We were so happy
just the two of us.

41:50.233 --> 41:52.967
I never thought I could be
that happy...

41:55.255 --> 41:58.014
and I'm just so scared
to lose you.

42:00.076 --> 42:03.186
<i> (people shouting)</i>

42:09.694 --> 42:11.510
- You've got to trust the jury.

42:11.530 --> 42:14.346
I mean, the facts in this case
were overwhelming.

42:14.366 --> 42:16.607
Esme Barnes laid in wait
for nearly two weeks

42:16.701 --> 42:20.444
before running two men down in
cold blood with an automobile.

42:20.597 --> 42:24.857
It's difficult to even imagine
a clearer example
of premeditation,

42:24.934 --> 42:31.030
and the jury arrived at the
only possible verdict, guilty.

42:31.049 --> 42:35.367
- But a lot of people see
Esme Barnes as a hero,
so what would you say to them?

42:35.387 --> 42:40.473
- I would ask them to take a
long hard look at the kind of
world that they want to live in.

42:42.209 --> 42:43.893
<i> Two more people are dead.</i>

42:44.971 --> 42:50.400
<i> Two people who were planning</i>
<i> to build a life together now</i>
<i> never will.</i>

42:51.719 --> 42:55.655
<i> And I have to believe</i>
<i> that we can do better.</i>
