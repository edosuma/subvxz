00:14.139 --> 00:16.558
I have no information
from anyone in space.

00:16.642 --> 00:18.143
I mean, this is important.

00:18.727 --> 00:20.270
Ground Leader checking in.

00:20.354 --> 00:24.066
I was directly told that we cannot
land on Mars before we do a med check.

00:25.108 --> 00:26.401
Meteor shower incoming!

00:26.485 --> 00:28.362
We have a meteor shower!

00:29.821 --> 00:32.241
CAPCOM, come in.

00:32.323 --> 00:36.203
Guys, just stay calm. We believe the
orbiter can survive the meteor shower.

00:37.996 --> 00:39.540
I believe we have a leak.

00:41.291 --> 00:43.335
OK, pressure's going down. This is bad.

00:43.418 --> 00:44.544
What do we do?

00:44.628 --> 00:45.837
Get them out of here!

00:45.921 --> 00:47.881
<i>No! Oh my god!</i>

00:49.091 --> 00:50.133
Throw them in the FEMA hallway!

00:50.217 --> 00:52.302
Moderate cabin pressure
onboard the Station.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.596
<i>Cabin leak check. Losing air pressure.</i>

01:00.477 --> 01:01.645
Are we dead?

01:03.146 --> 01:04.105
<i>Are we OK?</i>

01:04.940 --> 01:05.983
All in a day's work!

01:14.032 --> 01:18.453
Space for me is one of the things
that defines me most, I think.

01:18.537 --> 01:21.081
It really is a central part of who I am.

01:21.164 --> 01:22.499
I am a space nerd.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.793
Yeah, I would say that I am a space nerd!

01:24.876 --> 01:28.297
I am the biggest space nerd
of all the space nerds ever.

01:28.380 --> 01:30.590
It may not look like it, but I am.

01:30.674 --> 01:32.926
<i>Because space is space and it's awesome.</i>

01:33.719 --> 01:37.472
- <i>Up here we may be slightly...</i>
<i>- </i><i>OK, stand by.</i>

01:37.556 --> 01:40.892
<i>We have you go for orbit.</i>
<i>You're go for orbit.</i>

01:41.810 --> 01:43.937
<i>When we look at the night sky, we think</i>

01:44.021 --> 01:48.191
"Are there any planets out there
that are possible homes for humanity?"

01:48.275 --> 01:51.820
<i>The spacecraft almost seemed</i>
<i>to grow stronger as the days went by.</i>

01:51.903 --> 01:56.116
Going to Mars will foster
an entire revolution

01:56.199 --> 01:59.745
<i>in how people think about</i>
<i>how they will invest their brain energy</i>

01:59.828 --> 02:01.246
<i>in their lives and in their careers.</i>

02:01.330 --> 02:04.458
By the way, this next generation wants
to do it because they know it's cool.

02:04.541 --> 02:07.044
<i>Go for landing, 3,000 feet.</i>

02:07.711 --> 02:10.672
<i>You're looking great,</i>
<i>so we know it will be a good flight.</i>

02:10.756 --> 02:12.883
<i>Astronauts report it feels good.</i>

02:12.966 --> 02:14.593
<i>It's been over 50 years</i>

02:14.676 --> 02:17.220
<i>since we've done</i>
<i>something significant like this.</i>

02:17.304 --> 02:20.599
<i>Having a man, or woman, walk on Mars</i>

02:20.682 --> 02:22.643
is just the most badass thought
in my mind.

02:22.726 --> 02:24.186
<i>Liftoff.</i>

02:28.732 --> 02:30.651
I think Mars is an interesting planet

02:30.734 --> 02:33.570
and it would be fascinating
to do science there.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.322
<i>We just had word from Houston</i>

02:35.405 --> 02:38.575
<i>we're ready to have you get out</i>
<i>whenever you're ready.</i>

02:39.576 --> 02:41.620
<i>OK, we've got our go now.</i>
<i>Is that right?</i>

02:41.703 --> 02:42.621
<i>Affirmative.</i>

02:42.704 --> 02:45.624
<i>This is where people</i>
<i>are going to live, on another planet,</i>

02:45.707 --> 02:47.626
<i>close enough to get there in under a year.</i>

02:47.709 --> 02:50.670
So yes, it's dangerous!
Yes, it's never been attempted.

02:50.754 --> 02:52.297
Yes, you're probably gonna die.

02:53.090 --> 02:55.384
But you can do it still.

02:55.467 --> 02:57.094
<i> How you doing,</i>
<i>Mission Control?</i>

02:57.177 --> 02:59.638
- <i>Good.</i>
<i>- </i><i>Telcom? Guidance, happy?</i>

02:59.721 --> 03:01.181
<i>- </i><i>Go!</i>
<i>- </i><i> Final go!</i>

03:01.264 --> 03:04.976
<i>2,000 feet. 2,000 feet.</i>
<i>Into the air, 47 degrees.</i>

03:05.060 --> 03:06.186
<i>Roger.</i>

03:06.269 --> 03:08.146
<i>Does anyone regret going to the Moon?</i>

03:08.230 --> 03:11.108
<i>Does anyone who lived in the 60s say,</i>
<i>"What a waste of time,</i>

03:11.191 --> 03:14.236
I wish we hadn't done that."?
No. Going to the Moon was awesome.

03:14.319 --> 03:16.947
Everyone's happy we went to the Moon!
Mars is even cooler.

03:17.030 --> 03:20.075
<i>Mariner is the spacecraft.</i>
<i>Mars is the destination.</i>

03:20.992 --> 03:25.080
<i>Americans could once again </i>
<i>look up towards their future with faith</i>

03:25.163 --> 03:26.706
<i>and with confidence.</i>

03:26.790 --> 03:30.377
We're focused on Mars.
That's NASA's ultimate goal.

03:30.460 --> 03:34.381
<i>To lead other nations,</i>
<i>and particularly ourselves,</i>

03:34.464 --> 03:35.590
<i>with humans to Mars.</i>

03:36.258 --> 03:39.428
<i>The retrograde rockets</i>
<i>will be tested in space.</i>

03:39.511 --> 03:41.888
<i>The antenna housing</i>
<i>will transmit telemetry.</i>

03:43.140 --> 03:46.685
<i>Ever since I was little,</i>
<i>I've always had a passion for space.</i>

03:47.269 --> 03:51.732
It would be so amazing just to see
the Martian surface with my own eyes.

03:51.815 --> 03:53.608
<i>T minus 25 seconds.</i>

03:54.317 --> 03:57.195
We will go to Mars.
Let's go out there and explore.

03:57.279 --> 04:00.157
Let's make discoveries.
Let's change the world.

04:10.500 --> 04:13.587
<i>- </i><i>Is this the PCS right here?</i>
<i>- </i><i> OK, the L Cone...</i>

04:13.670 --> 04:15.589
<i>A couple of things you need to know.</i>

04:15.672 --> 04:19.801
<i>When the launch happens going to Mars,</i>
<i>what are we going to say to the press?</i>

04:19.885 --> 04:22.053
<i>I mean, I'm sure Neil Armstrong</i>
<i>had a ton of time</i>

04:22.137 --> 04:23.972
<i>to think what his first words would be.</i>

04:24.055 --> 04:26.057
I know what I would say.
What do we want?

04:26.141 --> 04:27.392
Oranges.

04:27.476 --> 04:29.186
When do we want we want them? Oranges!

04:29.269 --> 04:31.313
Fantastic.
That's a great monologue.

04:31.396 --> 04:34.191
However, we're going to transition
to practicing your checklists now.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.568
Everybody has a checklist
that was either on their seat

04:36.651 --> 04:38.069
or around their space.

04:38.153 --> 04:39.321
It's under your suits.

04:39.404 --> 04:42.491
It's what happens when you start
before the mission starts.

04:43.241 --> 04:47.496
Coming to Space Camp
is the closest I can really get to space,

04:47.579 --> 04:50.207
at least emotionally and psychologically.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.542
7A on.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.044
Do you guys feel good?

04:54.127 --> 04:55.212
C auto.

04:56.963 --> 04:58.757
Tank 9. Reset.

04:59.424 --> 05:01.301
This is the suiting up process.

05:01.384 --> 05:02.803
We'll transition over.

05:02.886 --> 05:04.095
Grab the book. You got it?

05:04.179 --> 05:05.931
<i>If people want to</i>
<i>call me a space nerd,</i>

05:06.014 --> 05:07.098
<i>they can call me a space nerd.</i>

05:07.182 --> 05:09.351
<i>And I'll say "Yeah, so what do you</i>
<i>want to know about space?</i>

05:09.434 --> 05:12.729
<i>You want to know</i>
<i>about SRBs, egress, ECLSS?"</i>

05:12.813 --> 05:14.231
And they'll be like "What?"

05:14.314 --> 05:17.317
And I'll be like "So, wait, which one
did you want to know about?

05:17.400 --> 05:19.361
Cause I can give you at least five,

05:19.444 --> 05:22.489
maybe ten minutes of conversation
for each one.

05:22.572 --> 05:23.657
Come at me, bro!"

05:23.740 --> 05:25.742
-Let me out of this.
-Come on, Josh!

05:25.826 --> 05:30.747
Today, we were the first group ever
to test out this new Mars Mission.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.041
This mission is a futuristic mission,

05:33.124 --> 05:35.460
obviously, because we haven't
gone to Mars at this point.

05:35.544 --> 05:37.546
This is MEB, the Mars Elysium Base.

05:37.629 --> 05:40.674
And this base has been delivered
to Mars already

05:40.757 --> 05:44.594
with all the gear that you guys
are gonna need to set it up, OK?

05:44.678 --> 05:49.015
<i>The Mars Mission is something</i>
<i>that they've had in R&D for a while.</i>

05:49.099 --> 05:54.563
It's exhilarating, the fact that
we are simulating a mission to Mars.

05:54.646 --> 05:56.606
You got your guy out there. Pull it up.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.441
<i>We are training to go to Mars.</i>

05:58.525 --> 06:02.237
<i>We know that there will be problems</i>
<i>because it is dangerous.</i>

06:02.320 --> 06:06.700
We need to have the simulator
as close to a nominal mission as possible.

06:07.742 --> 06:09.119
This is gonna be intense!

06:10.370 --> 06:13.748
Space Camp was designed
to simulate the peak of NASA.

06:14.583 --> 06:18.128
<i>This is cool! Woah!</i>

06:18.211 --> 06:21.798
<i>Here at Space Camp,</i>
<i>we learn a lot about space history</i>

06:21.881 --> 06:24.134
<i>and what it will be like</i>
<i>to be an astronaut.</i>

06:24.217 --> 06:28.346
All of the simulators here,
NASA has been recruited to help design.

06:28.430 --> 06:32.434
<i>So, they're as close as we can get</i>
<i>to what the astronauts actually use.</i>

06:35.270 --> 06:36.771
Oh my God!

06:40.567 --> 06:42.694
<i>This is my third year at Space Camp.</i>

06:42.777 --> 06:45.614
I said, "I'm going to
apply for a scholarship,"

06:45.697 --> 06:48.825
<i>because being an astronaut is</i>
<i>something I don't want to give up on.</i>

06:48.908 --> 06:50.660
I'm going up whether I want to or not!

06:50.744 --> 06:52.537
<i>I had to get three letters</i>
<i>of recommendation,</i>

06:52.621 --> 06:54.873
<i>I had to write two essays,</i>

06:54.956 --> 06:56.374
and I had to do a science experiment

06:56.458 --> 06:58.710
and break it down
in the scientific method.

06:59.794 --> 07:01.630
Oh! Good job, Victoria!

07:02.964 --> 07:05.508
<i>I believe that</i>
<i>the people who come here</i>

07:05.592 --> 07:09.054
<i>are the future of the space program.</i>

07:09.137 --> 07:11.222
<i>It's really giving us an education</i>

07:11.306 --> 07:15.560
on how to be a person
who works with space on a daily basis.

07:15.644 --> 07:20.482
When I grow up, I would like to be
CAPCOM for NASA.

07:20.565 --> 07:23.568
-I want to become a mission specialist.
-Be a machine toolist.

07:23.652 --> 07:24.819
I want to be an engineer.

07:24.903 --> 07:25.946
Aerospace engineer.

07:26.029 --> 07:31.868
It would be amazing to construct engines
for a mission to Mars.

07:31.952 --> 07:34.663
When you enter the base
and turn on the emergency power,

07:34.746 --> 07:35.705
it turns to red lighting.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.332
That's what we're wanting...

07:37.415 --> 07:40.460
<i>The base that they've designed</i>
<i>up there is fascinating.</i>

07:40.543 --> 07:41.920
The base is all powered down.

07:42.003 --> 07:44.255
They have to turn on
the communications array,

07:44.339 --> 07:47.842
<i>set up the solar panels,</i>
<i>set up all of the ECLSS systems,</i>

07:47.926 --> 07:49.386
<i>and also set up a greenhouse</i>

07:49.469 --> 07:52.305
because somebody
might want to eat up there.

07:52.389 --> 07:55.934
- Activate the power.
- Hey, guys. The hydro popo is in here.

07:56.017 --> 08:00.230
<i>The fact that people</i>
<i>are now even teaching children,</i>

08:00.313 --> 08:02.357
<i>16 year-olds, 15 year-olds,</i>

08:02.440 --> 08:06.945
<i>saying, "Hey, we're going to Mars"</i>
<i>and simulating how it would work out,</i>

08:07.028 --> 08:10.657
means they'll grow up and we'll grow up
to believe: hey, we're going to Mars.

08:10.740 --> 08:12.033
<i>So let's go to Mars.</i>

08:12.117 --> 08:13.493
I'll go there in a minute.

08:14.285 --> 08:15.954
Well, good luck.

08:22.043 --> 08:24.295
<i>Of all the planets in the solar system,</i>

08:24.379 --> 08:27.674
<i>Earth and Mars, the third and fourth</i>
<i>planets from the Sun,</i>

08:27.757 --> 08:29.050
<i>are the most similar.</i>

08:30.510 --> 08:35.682
<i>But despite the similarities,</i>
<i>Mars is essentially like no other planet.</i>

08:35.765 --> 08:40.311
<i>One of the greatest </i>
<i>allures of Mars is that Mars is nearby.</i>

08:40.395 --> 08:44.399
Mars is a planet,
and it's a planet with potential.

08:44.482 --> 08:47.569
<i>It once had water. It once had oceans.</i>

08:47.652 --> 08:50.947
Surely, we tell ourselves,
it once had life.

08:51.531 --> 08:54.034
<i> Science fiction writers </i>
<i>populated the cities</i>

08:54.117 --> 08:59.622
<i>with terrible creatures of heroic size,</i>
<i>with skills beyond earthman's dreams.</i>

09:00.290 --> 09:03.543
<i>This is a place that touches us</i>
<i>in a very basic way.</i>

09:03.626 --> 09:06.963
<i>Another thing is that</i>
<i>it's always had the power</i>

09:07.047 --> 09:08.882
to scare the daylights out of us.

09:13.386 --> 09:17.640
<i> It was always the blood red world</i>
<i>that was just nearby,</i>

09:17.724 --> 09:21.853
<i>that, through telescopes,</i>
<i>appeared to have canals,</i>

09:21.936 --> 09:25.607
<i>which presumed people</i>
<i>or some kind of organisms.</i>

09:25.690 --> 09:30.487
<i>And since the only model we know</i>
<i>for intelligent organisms</i>

09:30.570 --> 09:34.991
<i>is organisms that eventually try to</i>
<i>grab land and resources and go to war,</i>

09:35.075 --> 09:36.826
<i>Mars used to frighten us.</i>

09:40.246 --> 09:41.706
<i> Welcome to Mars.</i>

09:41.790 --> 09:46.669
<i>There's a whole endless string</i>
<i>of movies and television shows and stories</i>

09:46.753 --> 09:48.838
about aliens, alien life.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.549
<i>Now, this is the plan:</i>
<i>get your ass to Mars.</i>

09:52.675 --> 09:54.427
<i>When people hear the word "Mars",</i>

09:54.511 --> 09:58.681
<i>they think of science fiction,</i>
<i>of geeks talking about Martians and Mars.</i>

09:58.765 --> 10:01.267
And as soon as we go there
and there's humans there, that changes.

10:01.351 --> 10:03.520
This is not science fiction.
This is now something we do.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.271
This is part of life. This is real.

10:06.147 --> 10:09.275
<i>I had no idea that</i> The Martian
<i>would have mainstream appeal.</i>

10:09.359 --> 10:10.777
<i>It never even occurred to me.</i>

10:10.860 --> 10:14.989
I thought I was writing it for this tiny
niche audience of hardcore space dorks.

10:18.284 --> 10:21.746
<i>We fell in love with Mars</i>
<i>a long, long time ago</i>

10:21.830 --> 10:26.042
and our goal now is to be a part of Mars,
is to live on Mars.

10:27.252 --> 10:29.879
<i>Doing something as hard</i>
<i>as going to Mars doesn't just happen.</i>

10:29.963 --> 10:31.923
You need like a perfect storm
in many ways.

10:32.006 --> 10:34.926
You need the right moment
with the right funding,

10:35.009 --> 10:37.554
with the right people or person.

10:46.020 --> 10:48.773
<i>Wernher von Braun</i>
<i>is a famous German scientist</i>

10:48.857 --> 10:53.528
<i>and he took these ideas</i>
<i>about how to operate liquid-fueled rockets</i>

10:53.611 --> 10:56.948
<i>and he made these extraordinary spacecraft</i>

10:57.031 --> 10:59.242
that went on to put humans on the Moon.

11:01.452 --> 11:03.580
<i>Wernher von Braun,</i>
<i>when he designed</i>

11:03.663 --> 11:05.331
<i>and built the Apollo program,</i>

11:05.415 --> 11:09.294
in the back of his mind already,
he was way past Apollo.

11:09.377 --> 11:12.046
He and his team were talking about:
how do we get to Mars?

11:15.425 --> 11:19.262
We knew that the city of Huntsville
was solidly behind us,

11:19.345 --> 11:21.598
and with your continued support

11:21.681 --> 11:26.019
I will see you back in orbit
with that new space station,

11:26.102 --> 11:29.397
to which we will all ride
in the reusable launch vehicle,

11:29.480 --> 11:31.858
and maybe one day
we'll have a man on Mars.

11:31.941 --> 11:32.775
Thank you.

11:50.501 --> 11:52.003
<i>Von Braun was a Nazi.</i>

11:52.086 --> 11:54.088
<i>Von Braun was in the SS,</i>

11:54.172 --> 11:57.050
which is the dreaded element
of the Nazi party.

11:57.133 --> 12:01.471
<i>And von Braun was</i>
<i>Hitler's top weapons maker.</i>

12:02.639 --> 12:06.559
<i>From a man who held</i>
<i>a dark and hateful cause,</i>

12:06.643 --> 12:09.270
<i>came a missile that gave America</i>

12:09.354 --> 12:12.523
<i>one of its greatest</i>
<i>historical inspirations.</i>

12:12.607 --> 12:16.486
So Wernher von Braun is...a mixed bag.

12:32.502 --> 12:34.671
- You tightened the valves?
- It works.

12:34.754 --> 12:37.632
Dude, wherever I cut one
I should cut the other, right?

12:37.715 --> 12:38.549
Yeah.

12:38.633 --> 12:43.179
So what do you say?
One, two, three, four, five, six.

12:43.262 --> 12:45.264
How about six runs up and six runs up?

12:45.348 --> 12:48.601
So it's one, two, three four.
So it's the fourth one down.

12:48.685 --> 12:52.605
<i>If you could combine nerdy and cool,</i>
<i>I hope you could get something like me.</i>

12:53.648 --> 12:54.565
How's it going?

12:54.649 --> 12:58.194
It's a little rough. The X-Acto knife
slipped twice, as you can see.

12:58.277 --> 13:01.489
-Just got little duct tape bandages.
-Here, use better duct tape.

13:02.073 --> 13:03.491
Yeah, that's a good point.

13:03.574 --> 13:06.494
<i>Nerdiness has kind of taken</i>
<i>a bad rap over the years.</i>

13:06.577 --> 13:09.372
And nerdy is the new cool.

13:09.455 --> 13:12.667
But that doesn't mean you have to
start wearing Jordans or anything.

13:12.750 --> 13:15.670
But I feel like the egg should be
standing up in the compartment, though.

13:15.753 --> 13:18.172
- It will.
- Like standing vertically.

13:18.256 --> 13:20.008
- I know.
- All right, cool.

13:20.091 --> 13:23.761
<i>I'm hoping one day to run for office</i>
<i>and work my way up in Washington,</i>

13:23.845 --> 13:26.264
<i>and ultimately get NASA</i>
<i>the funding it needs</i>

13:26.347 --> 13:29.142
to, you know, do these great things
like go to Mars.

13:29.225 --> 13:33.730
We usually just, I think we should fold it
in a way that it will definitely deploy.

13:33.813 --> 13:36.315
<i>The model rockets</i>
<i>is a good challenge for the group.</i>

13:36.399 --> 13:38.776
Of course, rocketry is
directly connected with NASA.

13:42.447 --> 13:45.074
<i> So the awesome thing</i>
<i>about rockets, I'd say,</i>

13:45.158 --> 13:47.577
is that they're handing explosives

13:47.660 --> 13:50.747
and a whole bunch of, like,
firing power to teenagers.

13:50.830 --> 13:54.250
<i>And they're like,</i>
<i>"Here, go make it, go up into the air</i>

13:54.333 --> 13:56.127
<i>and if it explodes, have fun with it."</i>

13:56.210 --> 13:59.922
So it's, like, yeah,
I'm definitely going to do this.

14:00.548 --> 14:04.969
We're gonna have to find
a way for it to disconnect

14:05.053 --> 14:08.598
while keeping the shot cord
inside of the body...

14:08.681 --> 14:10.266
-Oh yeah, definitely.
-Somehow...

14:10.349 --> 14:11.893
<i>I enjoy building rockets.</i>

14:11.976 --> 14:17.148
Later today we are launching our rocket
with our eggstronaut Egbert in it.

14:17.231 --> 14:21.444
And it has been so much fun
just building it and tossing around ideas.

14:23.112 --> 14:27.158
Put the hot glue
on the edges of these and stick it down.

14:27.241 --> 14:30.078
<i> The two things you're learning</i>
<i>from these model rockets</i>

14:30.161 --> 14:33.915
is crew survivability and aerodynamics.

14:33.998 --> 14:37.377
Everything else is intact.
We just can't get this stuff tangled up.

14:37.460 --> 14:39.796
As soon as this gets tangled,
we're kind of done.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.757
- Let's see how this drop goes.
- High check, science geeks.

14:44.384 --> 14:45.510
Very nice.

14:45.593 --> 14:47.804
<i> You have to keep</i>
<i>your precious payload alive,</i>

14:47.887 --> 14:52.600
<i>and you want it to pierce through the air</i>
<i>in a beautiful parabolic trajectory.</i>

14:52.683 --> 14:53.601
Ooh!

14:53.684 --> 14:55.395
That fits there really well.

14:55.478 --> 14:57.897
<i>It's really important</i>
<i>that we see the big picture.</i>

14:57.980 --> 15:01.484
It's important that the whole system,
including our eggstronaut,

15:01.567 --> 15:02.819
<i>are safe and reliable.</i>

15:03.778 --> 15:06.656
No, no, no.
That means we have 250 left.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.533
- And then we have 150--
- 150 left.

15:08.616 --> 15:12.578
And then we just used 100
for the motor tube. So we would have 50.

15:12.662 --> 15:15.873
<i>In our engineering challenges,</i>
<i>we're assigned a budget for what we do</i>

15:15.957 --> 15:17.500
and you can't overspend it.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.253
And sometimes
you don't even have enough to begin with.

15:20.336 --> 15:22.755
Dude, we made a mistake
for the first item.

15:22.839 --> 15:25.716
This 150 is actually 200.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.552
So then now we're left with 100.

15:27.635 --> 15:32.598
The money is a big constriction
for humans in real life.

15:32.682 --> 15:35.435
So, they decided to make it
a constriction for us, too.

15:35.518 --> 15:37.478
How much money have we spent?

15:37.562 --> 15:40.148
Jace, I'm gonna go
glue these together, OK?

15:40.231 --> 15:41.566
<i>They put a limit on it to say,</i>

15:41.649 --> 15:44.068
"Hey, we're not gonna give you
all the materials,

15:44.152 --> 15:46.696
because if we did
you could do so much."

15:46.779 --> 15:51.409
So the way these rocket engines work
is it propels downwards.

15:51.492 --> 15:54.162
When we deploy it,
the parachute's gonna unfurl

15:54.245 --> 15:56.122
and it's gonna float down like this.

15:56.205 --> 15:57.832
And our egg's gonna survive.

15:57.915 --> 16:00.376
Good stuff, guys!
This was a productive session.

16:01.627 --> 16:02.795
Ballin' till we drop!

16:12.472 --> 16:14.849
<i>The V2 rocket was built</i>
<i>by Wernher von Braun</i>

16:14.932 --> 16:16.642
<i>and his team of engineers.</i>

16:16.726 --> 16:17.852
<i>It hits randomly.</i>

16:17.935 --> 16:20.813
<i>You don't really know what you're hitting,</i>
<i>what you're killing,</i>

16:20.897 --> 16:22.315
<i>what you're destroying.</i>

16:22.398 --> 16:24.317
<i>That was what the V2 did.</i>

16:24.400 --> 16:27.111
The "V", for goodness' sake,
stood for "Vengeance".

16:29.197 --> 16:32.450
<i>It was the weapon that resulted</i>
<i>from a tantrum,</i>

16:32.533 --> 16:34.410
<i>in this case the tantrum of the führer.</i>

16:34.494 --> 16:39.457
<i>He wanted to lash back,</i>
<i>as all losing causes do.</i>

16:39.540 --> 16:40.917
They flail at the end.

16:43.377 --> 16:46.255
<i>The President of the United States.</i>

16:46.797 --> 16:49.634
General Eisenhower informs me

16:49.717 --> 16:54.597
that the forces of Germany
have surrendered to the United Nations.

16:54.680 --> 16:58.476
<i>The flags of freedom fly all over Europe.</i>

16:58.559 --> 17:00.144
<i>At the end of World War II,</i>

17:00.228 --> 17:03.481
<i>the Cold War had, in essence,</i>
<i>already begun.</i>

17:03.564 --> 17:09.694
<i>It was clear to the Allies that</i>
<i>we could not coexist with the Soviets.</i>

17:12.698 --> 17:16.661
<i>If we didn't get von Braun,</i>
<i>then the Soviets would.</i>

17:16.743 --> 17:18.119
We had to have him.

17:25.502 --> 17:27.421
<i>Oh my gosh!</i>

17:27.505 --> 17:29.298
<i>How soon we forget</i>

17:29.382 --> 17:35.012
how evil the communist empire
was perceived to be

17:35.096 --> 17:36.722
in that day and in that time.

17:36.806 --> 17:40.726
And how much of a motivating factor
that was to do anything we could

17:40.810 --> 17:43.396
to not be bested by our arch enemy.

17:43.479 --> 17:47.900
<i>Not a lot of Americans</i>
<i>know that we took a...a Nazi,</i>

17:47.984 --> 17:53.739
someone who helped designed rockets
that were intended to kill us,

17:53.823 --> 17:57.159
<i>relocated him and his team</i>
<i>eventually to Huntsville, Alabama,</i>

17:57.243 --> 18:00.913
<i>where they became founding fathers</i>
<i>of the spaceflight program.</i>

18:04.584 --> 18:09.213
<i>He became such a vocal figurehead</i>

18:09.297 --> 18:14.010
for space, for exploration,
for the red planet.

18:15.052 --> 18:19.223
<i>In the early to middle '50s,</i>
<i>von Braun became famous.</i>

18:19.307 --> 18:26.022
<i>He began writing long magazine articles</i>
<i>about travel to the Moon and to Mars.</i>

18:26.105 --> 18:28.190
<i>And he even signed a deal with Disney.</i>

18:28.274 --> 18:31.110
<i>When</i>
<i>the day arrives for construction to begin,</i>

18:31.193 --> 18:33.779
the thousands of parts
for the space station

18:33.863 --> 18:37.533
will be transported to the orbit
by our multistage rockets.

18:37.617 --> 18:41.162
It's a real moment in American history

18:41.245 --> 18:45.249
when 42 million Americans tune in

18:45.333 --> 18:49.754
<i>to watch von Braun talk</i>
<i>on a Disney television program</i>

18:49.837 --> 18:51.505
<i>about space travel.</i>

18:51.589 --> 18:53.424
If we were to start today

18:53.507 --> 18:56.886
on an organized
and well supported space program,

18:56.969 --> 19:02.642
<i>I believe a practical passenger rocket</i>
<i>could be built and tested within 10 years.</i>

19:06.312 --> 19:08.147
<i>Today, a new moon is in the sky,</i>

19:08.230 --> 19:12.193
<i>a 23 inch metal sphere</i>
<i>placed in orbit by a Russian rocket.</i>

19:12.276 --> 19:14.695
<i>500 miles up, the artificial moon</i>
<i>is boosted</i>

19:14.779 --> 19:17.531
<i>to a speed counterbalancing</i>
<i>the pull of gravity,</i>

19:17.615 --> 19:18.532
<i>and released.</i>

19:20.034 --> 19:25.790
The whole applecart was overturned
when the Russians put Sputnik into orbit,

19:25.873 --> 19:30.086
causing a national nervous breakdown
as a consequence.

19:30.169 --> 19:34.507
The Soviets had Sputnik up in the sky
and you could hear the beeping going by.

19:35.508 --> 19:39.053
<i>The entire country</i>
<i>was in shock by Sputnik.</i>

19:41.597 --> 19:45.768
<i>Sputnik orbited the Earth</i>
<i>on what you would say in military terms</i>

19:45.851 --> 19:48.521
was the ultimate high ground of space!

19:49.730 --> 19:52.483
<i>The reaction was</i>
<i>one of astonishment and concern.</i>

19:52.566 --> 19:54.735
<i>For it was now known</i>
<i>that a potential enemy</i>

19:54.819 --> 19:59.031
<i>was at least temporarily ahead</i>
<i>in developing means for space travel.</i>

20:00.032 --> 20:02.493
We were scared to death
when Sputnik went up.

20:02.576 --> 20:04.286
<i>And then we were scared to death</i>

20:04.370 --> 20:07.373
when the Russians
beat us to orbit with a human.

20:07.998 --> 20:11.419
<i>It seemed at once that</i>
<i>this competitive style of government</i>

20:11.502 --> 20:16.048
<i>was producing technology faster,</i>
<i>outstripping the United States.</i>

20:16.132 --> 20:19.719
<i>And so, a civilian space agency</i>
<i>was formed,</i>

20:19.802 --> 20:22.888
<i>and that's the National Aeronautics</i>
<i>and Space Administration, NASA.</i>

20:34.442 --> 20:37.528
Welcome to
the Marshall Space Flight Center.

20:37.611 --> 20:40.239
Our special task here in Huntsville

20:40.322 --> 20:43.033
is to develop
the rocket powered systems necessary

20:43.117 --> 20:45.661
<i>to orbit man in an Earth satellite.</i>

20:46.871 --> 20:49.915
You might say
we are the long distance movers.

20:50.875 --> 20:54.253
<i>All effort was given</i>
<i>toward making sure</i>

20:54.336 --> 20:57.590
<i>that America got into space pronto.</i>

20:57.673 --> 21:00.676
<i>And that is where von Braun</i>
<i>began his ascent</i>

21:00.760 --> 21:04.263
as kind of the American space savior.

21:04.346 --> 21:08.768
And from there, he became
the prophet of space exploration.

21:13.939 --> 21:17.026
For we meet
in an hour of change and challenge,

21:17.902 --> 21:20.738
in a decade of hope and fear,

21:20.821 --> 21:24.074
in an age of both knowledge and ignorance.

21:24.158 --> 21:28.954
The greater our knowledge increases,
the greater our ignorance unfolds.

21:29.038 --> 21:30.873
<i>When you think of the Apollo program,</i>

21:30.956 --> 21:33.876
when you think of man on the Moon,

21:33.959 --> 21:38.631
<i>no doubt von Braun</i>
<i>is a huge piece of JFK's legacy.</i>

21:38.714 --> 21:41.634
<i>The vast stretches of the unknown,</i>

21:41.717 --> 21:43.719
<i>and the unanswered,</i>

21:43.803 --> 21:45.638
<i>and the unfinished,</i>

21:45.721 --> 21:49.683
still far outstrip
our collective comprehension.

21:50.392 --> 21:53.562
To be the first person on Mars,
it would definitely put you up there

21:53.646 --> 21:56.857
with those big names
that most people know about space.

21:56.941 --> 22:01.403
<i>Alan Shepard, Yuri Gagarin,</i>
<i>Neil Armstrong, and von Braun.</i>

22:01.487 --> 22:05.866
It would definitely come
with a bit of infamy.

22:05.950 --> 22:12.331
<i> Surely the opening vistas of space</i>
<i>promise high costs and hardships,</i>

22:12.414 --> 22:14.250
<i>as well as high reward.</i>

22:14.917 --> 22:17.419
<i>So, it is not surprising</i>

22:17.503 --> 22:21.215
<i>that some would have us</i>
<i>stay where we are a little longer,</i>

22:21.298 --> 22:23.259
<i>to rest, to wait.</i>

22:23.342 --> 22:28.472
<i>To be sure, we are behind,</i>
<i>and will be behind for some time,</i>

22:28.556 --> 22:29.890
<i>in manned flight.</i>

22:29.974 --> 22:32.309
<i>But we do not intend to stay behind,</i>

22:32.393 --> 22:36.605
<i>and in this decade</i>
<i>we shall make up and move ahead.</i>

22:36.689 --> 22:39.400
<i>Building something from scratch</i>
<i>is a double-edged sword.</i>

22:39.483 --> 22:43.612
<i>You can't design</i>
<i>a perfect launch vehicle from scratch</i>

22:43.696 --> 22:45.489
and put it up on the pad
the very first time

22:45.573 --> 22:47.449
and expect things are gonna go well.

22:47.533 --> 22:50.703
This generation does not intend

22:50.786 --> 22:54.790
to founder in the backwash
of the coming age of space.

22:54.873 --> 22:58.002
We mean to be a part of it.
We mean to lead it.

22:58.085 --> 23:00.546
Since NASA was formed in 1958,

23:00.629 --> 23:03.340
we've had a pretty small
number of different missions

23:03.424 --> 23:04.550
that we've undertaken.

23:04.633 --> 23:06.844
<i>The first program was the Mercury program,</i>

23:06.927 --> 23:09.972
<i>just to see if an astronaut</i>
<i>could survive in zero gravity.</i>

23:10.055 --> 23:12.725
This is Flagship 7,
radio loud and clear. Over.

23:12.808 --> 23:14.935
<i>We went on to the Gemini program,</i>

23:15.019 --> 23:17.271
<i>sending two astronauts up in a capsule.</i>

23:18.439 --> 23:20.774
<i>We learned how to do</i>
<i>rendezvous and docking.</i>

23:21.400 --> 23:23.944
<i>And we learned how to</i>
<i>walk in space, to float there.</i>

23:24.820 --> 23:25.904
OK, yeah?

23:28.240 --> 23:29.241
OK.

23:31.160 --> 23:33.579
You're right in front, Ed.
You look beautiful!

23:33.662 --> 23:36.332
I feel like a million dollars!
So I'm gonna kick off!

23:37.916 --> 23:40.669
<i>We put together everything</i>
<i>we learned from Mercury and Gemini</i>

23:40.753 --> 23:42.129
<i>in the Apollo program.</i>

23:42.212 --> 23:47.384
<i>But why, some say, the Moon?</i>
<i>Why choose this as our goal?</i>

23:47.468 --> 23:51.597
<i>And they may well ask,</i>
<i>why climb the highest mountain?</i>

23:52.389 --> 23:54.183
<i>Liftoff! We have a liftoff!</i>

23:55.392 --> 23:59.021
<i> Many years ago,</i>
<i>the great British explorer George Mallory,</i>

23:59.104 --> 24:04.902
<i>who was to die on Mount Everest,</i>
<i>was asked why did he want to climb it.</i>

24:05.527 --> 24:07.279
<i>He said "Because it is there."</i>

24:07.363 --> 24:10.324
<i>Well, space is there,</i>
<i>and we're going to climb it.</i>

24:11.116 --> 24:13.410
<i>And the Moon and the planets are there.</i>

24:13.494 --> 24:15.954
<i>And new hopes</i>
<i>for knowledge and peace are there!</i>

24:17.122 --> 24:20.751
Going to the Moon, many people
just considered outright impossible.

24:21.335 --> 24:23.629
<i>Four forward,</i>
<i>drifting to the right a little.</i>

24:25.089 --> 24:28.092
<i>Once the impossible becomes possible,</i>

24:28.175 --> 24:31.220
that opens the floodgates
of human imagination.

24:31.303 --> 24:34.348
<i>That's one small step for man,</i>

24:36.600 --> 24:39.311
<i>one giant leap for mankind.</i>

24:45.526 --> 24:50.072
<i> We choose to go to the Moon!</i>
<i>We choose to go to the Moon!</i>

24:56.537 --> 25:00.874
<i>We choose to go to the Moon in this decade</i>
<i>and do the other things,</i>

25:00.958 --> 25:04.628
<i>not because they are easy,</i>
<i>but because they are hard.</i>

25:27.526 --> 25:31.405
We should probably check it,
cause last time we had a pretty bad angle.

25:31.488 --> 25:33.157
Dude, come on, let's check it.

25:34.491 --> 25:38.162
No, I just want to make sure ours
is positioned so we won't die again.

25:39.037 --> 25:42.207
<i>As a kid, I would love to witness</i>
<i>one of our presidents</i>

25:42.291 --> 25:46.754
<i>challenge NASA to land on Mars</i>
<i>in a deadline that may seem impossible.</i>

25:46.837 --> 25:50.215
Because I feel like
few things motivate humans.

25:50.299 --> 25:54.011
I mean the Soviets motivated us,
but that was out of fear.

25:55.512 --> 25:57.598
I swear, if ours doesn't work

25:57.681 --> 25:59.391
-I'm crying!
-Oh crap, dude!

25:59.475 --> 26:02.394
Ours looks all bent up and everything.
What is he doing?

26:02.478 --> 26:05.981
Dude, now look at it!
We're bent to the side now. Oh my god.

26:06.064 --> 26:08.567
- It's going to go that way.
- ...two, one...

26:11.278 --> 26:13.405
-Please, please deploy!
-Do it, do it, do it!

26:13.489 --> 26:15.449
Yeah!

26:18.494 --> 26:20.954
Rub the orange!
Rub the orange! Rub the orange!

26:23.999 --> 26:27.419
<i>I think we should go to Mars because</i>
<i>we would learn so much along the way.</i>

26:27.503 --> 26:29.713
<i>Forget about actually stepping on Mars.</i>

26:29.797 --> 26:32.925
I think the journey there
is far more important.

26:33.008 --> 26:36.094
We're checking the payload
to see if it's still intact.

26:36.178 --> 26:37.346
See any juice?

26:38.138 --> 26:39.181
Oooh...

26:40.390 --> 26:42.476
This chute idea might have saved us.

26:47.064 --> 26:47.981
It's cracked.

26:48.649 --> 26:52.778
No! I think we made it!
Oh my god, we made it!

26:52.861 --> 26:54.279
Whoa!

26:54.988 --> 26:55.823
Yes!

26:58.200 --> 27:00.661
Wow, that was so ratchet.

27:04.498 --> 27:08.210
<i>Bob, this is Gene</i>
<i>and I'm on the surface.</i>

27:10.879 --> 27:15.008
<i>I'd like to just say,</i>
<i>what I believe history will record:</i>

27:15.968 --> 27:20.806
<i>that America's challenge of today</i>

27:20.889 --> 27:24.059
<i>has forged man's destiny of tomorrow.</i>

27:24.142 --> 27:28.021
As soon as the first landing on the Moon
seemed inevitable,

27:28.105 --> 27:29.982
and certainly after it happened,

27:30.065 --> 27:33.277
every single story
written about that success

27:33.360 --> 27:37.155
included a secondary story
that said "So, what's next?"

27:37.865 --> 27:41.869
<i>And as we leave the Moon</i>
<i>at Taurus-Littrow,</i>

27:42.578 --> 27:44.204
<i>we leave as we came</i>

27:45.038 --> 27:47.249
<i>and, God willing, as we shall return:</i>

27:49.334 --> 27:54.381
<i>with peace and hope for all mankind.</i>

27:54.464 --> 27:56.925
<i>God speed the crew of Apollo 17.</i>

27:58.176 --> 28:03.223
<i> In that moment, von Braun </i>
<i>reveals his true ambition as a scientist.</i>

28:03.307 --> 28:05.601
<i>This is a great moment.</i>
<i>We've gotten to the Moon.</i>

28:05.684 --> 28:09.771
But actually it's a stepping stone
to the red planet, to Mars.

28:11.690 --> 28:14.026
<i>Wernher von Braun</i>
<i>talked about a Mars mission</i>

28:14.109 --> 28:19.281
<i>and he talked about a possible presence,</i>
<i>permanent presence, on Mars by 1981.</i>

28:20.449 --> 28:23.035
<i>That sounds insanely ambitious:</i>

28:23.118 --> 28:26.747
<i>11 years to have a permanent presence</i>
<i>on two planets.</i>

28:26.830 --> 28:30.208
<i>But the fact is,</i>
<i>it was equally hubristic to say</i>

28:30.292 --> 28:33.253
"And we're gonna put
a man on the Moon by 1969."

28:33.337 --> 28:34.922
Except we did it.

28:35.005 --> 28:41.094
<i>So everything we were talking about doing</i>
<i>in extremely short order, by 1981,</i>

28:41.178 --> 28:42.554
<i>getting people on Mars,</i>

28:42.638 --> 28:46.808
<i>was actually perfectly consistent</i>
<i>with the extremely short order work</i>

28:46.892 --> 28:48.727
<i>we had done to get to the Moon.</i>

28:49.978 --> 28:52.606
<i>The plan to go to Mars</i>
<i>was complicated in the '60s</i>

28:52.689 --> 28:56.860
because the way von Braun saw it,
this was gonna be a symbol of the future.

28:56.944 --> 29:00.322
But the way the public interpreted it
was entirely different.

29:00.405 --> 29:05.661
Now, of course, there are many other
things competing for public interest.

29:05.744 --> 29:11.792
<i>There is an election coming up,</i>
<i>and there is a war going on in Vietnam,</i>

29:11.875 --> 29:14.461
<i>and there are problems in the cities.</i>

29:14.544 --> 29:19.132
<i>And quite a few people seem to believe</i>

29:19.216 --> 29:23.011
<i>that we are taking money away</i>
<i>from the public purse.</i>

29:23.095 --> 29:27.849
We prefer to see our space program
in a somewhat different light.

29:27.933 --> 29:30.602
We believe that
we are actually producing values,

29:30.686 --> 29:32.020
and we are producing values

29:32.104 --> 29:36.525
at a faster rate than we are
taking money out of the treasury.

29:36.608 --> 29:40.946
<i>Nixon had a choice</i>
<i>to continue the program to go on to Mars.</i>

29:41.029 --> 29:44.992
<i>The infrastructure</i>
<i>for planetary exploration was in place.</i>

29:45.075 --> 29:48.745
The NASA personnel infrastructure
that had gotten us to the Moon

29:48.829 --> 29:50.956
was prepared to get us to Mars.

29:51.039 --> 29:55.627
Mr. Speaker,
the President of the United States!

30:00.966 --> 30:02.634
<i>I gotta tell you, everybody,</i>

30:02.718 --> 30:07.014
<i>this longing for the Apollo era</i>
<i>is not well advised.</i>

30:07.097 --> 30:08.140
<i>It's not coming back.</i>

30:08.223 --> 30:10.767
We're operating now
not under the Kennedy doctrine,

30:10.851 --> 30:12.352
but under the Nixon doctrine.

30:13.103 --> 30:16.690
In reaching the Moon,
we demonstrated

30:16.773 --> 30:20.944
what miracles American technology
is capable of achieving.

30:21.945 --> 30:24.614
And now the time has come
to move more deliberately

30:24.698 --> 30:28.201
toward making full use of that technology
here on Earth.

30:34.166 --> 30:35.751
<i>President Nixon and his advisors</i>

30:35.834 --> 30:39.963
<i>felt that U.S. public interest</i>
<i>in space exploration had waned.</i>

30:40.047 --> 30:43.050
<i>It was a very expensive undertaking.</i>
<i>Let's do something else.</i>

30:49.014 --> 30:53.810
<i>Sunday, April 12, 1981.</i>
<i>Kennedy Space Center, Florida.</i>

30:55.645 --> 30:56.646
<i>The Space Shuttle.</i>

30:57.647 --> 31:03.445
<i>Fourteen stories high, 2,000 tons,</i>
<i>poised on the pad for its maiden flight.</i>

31:03.528 --> 31:08.950
<i>Nixon's goal was to contract</i>
<i>America's space footprint.</i>

31:09.034 --> 31:13.830
<i>To make getting to and from orbit</i>
<i>routine, affordable,</i>

31:13.914 --> 31:15.248
<i>and ultimately profitable.</i>

31:15.332 --> 31:16.917
<i>But the Nixon doctrine,</i>

31:17.000 --> 31:22.130
the idea of monetizing
and simplifying access to orbit,

31:22.214 --> 31:23.382
did not work.

31:23.465 --> 31:27.928
<i>...two, one,</i>
<i>starting motor ignition and liftoff!</i>

31:28.011 --> 31:29.513
<i>Liftoff of Columbia!</i>

31:29.596 --> 31:31.640
<i>The shuttle has cleared the tower.</i>

31:31.723 --> 31:33.725
<i>Columbia, you're negative seats.</i>

31:35.394 --> 31:36.561
<i>And liftoff.</i>

31:36.645 --> 31:40.941
<i>Liftoff of the orbiter Challenger and</i>
<i>the sixth flight of the Space Shuttle.</i>

31:41.650 --> 31:45.695
<i>What's been happening at NASA</i>
<i>has been a very long term drift</i>

31:45.779 --> 31:48.073
<i>in terms of the manned space program.</i>

31:48.156 --> 31:49.491
<i>After we went to the Moon,</i>

31:49.574 --> 31:54.371
it was the carousel of shuttle flights
around the Earth for 30-some years.

31:54.454 --> 31:55.580
That was it.

31:56.248 --> 31:58.083
<i>We have ignition and liftoff</i>

31:58.166 --> 32:01.878
<i>of Atlantis and the Galileo spacecraft</i>
<i>bound for Jupiter.</i>

32:01.962 --> 32:03.588
<i>Roger roll, Atlantis.</i>

32:05.549 --> 32:08.468
<i>The Space Shuttle</i>
<i>can't reach deep space.</i>

32:08.552 --> 32:13.390
<i>The Space Shuttle was only designed</i>
<i>to go whizzing around the planet Earth.</i>

32:13.473 --> 32:17.436
<i>And so we began to realize</i>
<i>that NASA lost its way.</i>

32:17.519 --> 32:19.938
<i>And liftoff of Space Shuttle Discovery</i>

32:20.021 --> 32:24.192
<i>to complete NASA's constellation</i>
<i>of tracking stations in the sky.</i>

32:24.276 --> 32:26.903
<i>I understand things</i>
<i>are being done by NASA right now.</i>

32:26.987 --> 32:28.697
<i>But I feel like after the '60s,</i>

32:28.780 --> 32:32.701
the acceleration of the program
just declined to a sad point.

32:32.784 --> 32:35.078
<i>And liftoff</i>
<i>of the Space Shuttle Endeavour.</i>

32:35.162 --> 32:36.872
<i>Roger roll, Endeavour.</i>

32:36.955 --> 32:39.541
<i>We are no longer</i>
<i>advancing a space frontier.</i>

32:39.624 --> 32:43.003
A space frontier is:
how far have you gone lately?

32:43.086 --> 32:44.838
<i>Where are our farthest astronauts?</i>

32:44.921 --> 32:49.176
<i>They're 250 miles above our head,</i>
<i>driving around the block,</i>

32:49.259 --> 32:51.428
<i>boldly going</i>
<i>where hundreds have gone before.</i>

32:51.511 --> 32:53.305
<i>That is not advancing space frontiers.</i>

32:57.267 --> 33:00.729
<i>Low Earth orbit is about putting </i>
<i>stuff in space to look back down on Earth.</i>

33:00.812 --> 33:03.190
<i>It's about support for Earth industries.</i>

33:03.273 --> 33:06.568
The Space Shuttle
sounds like this big exciting thing.

33:06.651 --> 33:08.028
The Space Shuttle! We're exploring!

33:08.111 --> 33:11.364
But actually what the Space Shuttle was
was kind of a cargo delivery vehicle.

33:11.448 --> 33:15.285
<i>It would bring astronauts and equipment,</i>
<i>back and forth from low Earth orbit.</i>

33:24.461 --> 33:27.172
<i>The Shuttle drained</i>
<i>NASA's resources.</i>

33:27.255 --> 33:33.970
It was a financial sinkhole, essentially,
from 1975 up through 2011.

33:35.222 --> 33:39.267
Any dreams of going to Mars
during the Shuttle era were impossible

33:39.351 --> 33:42.395
<i>because all of the money</i>
<i>was going to the Shuttle.</i>

33:56.993 --> 34:01.122
<i>NASA is kind of at a holdup.</i>
<i>We haven't gone places.</i>

34:01.206 --> 34:02.499
<i>So don't go to space.</i>

34:02.582 --> 34:06.378
But what you can send to Mars
are non-humans and non-living things,

34:06.461 --> 34:07.295
<i>like robots.</i>

34:08.380 --> 34:10.382
Before you leave this table,

34:10.465 --> 34:13.717
I need you to figure out what
your robot's primary task is going to be.

34:13.802 --> 34:15.344
You can't just send all of them in there

34:15.428 --> 34:17.429
and have all four of them
try and do the same task.

34:17.514 --> 34:19.056
That's not going to be productive.

34:19.139 --> 34:21.893
All right, guys,
we got everything up here, so...

34:21.976 --> 34:23.228
Is that everything?

34:23.311 --> 34:25.647
- Yes, it is.
- Can we get a picture?

34:26.815 --> 34:28.190
<i>We do robotics at Space Camp</i>

34:28.275 --> 34:32.237
because robotics is
a huge part of the space program.

34:32.320 --> 34:34.697
Exploration done today
isn't done by humans.

34:34.781 --> 34:36.157
It's done by robots.

34:40.704 --> 34:43.748
<i>NASA's unmanned</i>
<i>exploration of the solar system</i>

34:43.831 --> 34:48.210
is the great unappreciated crown jewel
of the space agency.

34:48.295 --> 34:51.214
<i>It began here at</i>
<i>the Kennedy Space Center, Florida.</i>

34:51.297 --> 34:55.260
<i>Viking 1 and Viking 2 were readied</i>
<i>for their separate journeys to Mars.</i>

34:55.844 --> 34:59.347
<i>A robot is important</i>
<i>for forerunner exploration,</i>

34:59.431 --> 35:01.349
<i>where we send a robot first.</i>

35:01.433 --> 35:03.893
It lets us know
it's OK for us to go there.

35:03.977 --> 35:07.022
The planet Mars right now
is entirely populated by robots,

35:07.105 --> 35:09.357
which is an interesting thing
to think about.

35:17.824 --> 35:20.285
<i>Curiosity's designed</i>
<i>specifically to look at</i>

35:20.368 --> 35:22.996
<i>past habitability</i>
<i>and present habitability of Mars.</i>

35:23.872 --> 35:29.210
That's really taking the step of where
we understood there was once water on Mars

35:29.294 --> 35:32.964
to whether that water
could have supported life on Mars,

35:33.048 --> 35:35.800
<i>or maybe even still support life on Mars.</i>

35:35.884 --> 35:40.138
<i>And liftoff of the Atlas 5 with Curiosity,</i>

35:40.221 --> 35:44.434
<i>seeking clues to the planetary puzzle</i>
<i>about life on Mars.</i>

35:44.517 --> 35:46.478
<i>The thing that makes</i>
<i>Mars so incredible</i>

35:46.561 --> 35:48.605
<i>is that it's this sister planet of ours,</i>

35:48.688 --> 35:52.776
and the possibility that life could have
arisen there some time in the past,

35:52.859 --> 35:57.572
that maybe life is more prevalent
than we thought in the past.

35:58.073 --> 35:59.658
<i>At 10.13 local time</i>

35:59.741 --> 36:02.035
<i>we'll initiate</i>
<i>the descent stage thermal batteries,</i>

36:02.118 --> 36:04.579
and from that point on
EDL ops will take over.

36:04.663 --> 36:06.748
<i>I'm a little partial</i>
<i>to the Curiosity rover.</i>

36:06.831 --> 36:08.625
<i>We're down to 90 meters per second</i>

36:08.708 --> 36:11.211
<i>at an altitude of 6.5 kilometers</i>
<i>and descending.</i>

36:11.294 --> 36:13.421
I worked on that mission
for almost 10 years.

36:14.923 --> 36:16.216
<i>UHF is good.</i>

36:17.926 --> 36:19.719
<i>Touchdown confirmed.</i>
<i>We're safe on Mars!</i>

36:24.224 --> 36:26.226
I <i> think the longer you spend</i>
<i>working on them,</i>

36:26.309 --> 36:27.769
the more attached you are to them.

36:27.852 --> 36:29.354
They become kind of like kids.

36:29.437 --> 36:33.858
We are going to need a button pusher.

36:33.942 --> 36:35.193
-I can do that.
-Jace!

36:35.276 --> 36:39.197
Jace, just a heads up,
that's priority <i> numero uno!</i>

36:39.280 --> 36:42.909
Jace is a good programmer.
We can't afford not to--

36:42.992 --> 36:45.286
-Jace, are you programming right now?
-Yes.

36:45.370 --> 36:47.372
<i>With these robots, you have to learn</i>

36:47.455 --> 36:51.501
how to program them to work
without a human being at the controls.

36:51.584 --> 36:53.753
Can Bucky hold
one side of the yellow doors?

36:53.837 --> 36:56.256
Which side do you want?
I can program for both.

36:56.965 --> 37:02.303
Jace is so good at programming.
He just went right to it!

37:02.387 --> 37:06.307
He's got a ton of patience
when it comes to testing that robot.

37:06.391 --> 37:08.059
A lot of times in retrieval,

37:08.143 --> 37:10.186
the things are
in a very specific place every time.

37:10.270 --> 37:14.399
So we can make a rough program,
go out, figure out what happened wrong...

37:16.234 --> 37:19.112
...<i>then just make it more and more</i>
<i>and more and more precise</i>

37:19.195 --> 37:21.948
<i>so we can perfectly execute that</i>
<i>when the mission comes.</i>

37:22.031 --> 37:22.991
Activate COMS.

37:23.074 --> 37:25.201
<i>Right now I'm learning</i>
<i>how to code in Python.</i>

37:25.285 --> 37:29.664
I'm new to it. I'll admit,
I can't make something really complicated.

37:29.748 --> 37:32.834
<i>I can make a game of Pong work!</i>
<i>That's about it.</i>

37:32.917 --> 37:34.085
<i>But I'm learning.</i>

37:34.544 --> 37:38.214
A little nervous. It should work.
I programmed it for a long time.

37:50.602 --> 37:52.645
<i>With Curiosity,</i>
<i>what was amazing</i>

37:52.729 --> 37:58.193
was that the first drill hole we drilled
we found evidence of past water on Mars

37:58.276 --> 38:01.070
and that that water
was kind of relatively fresh

38:01.154 --> 38:05.033
and could have supported certain types
of life as we know them on Earth.

38:05.116 --> 38:09.287
<i>The next questions are really</i>
<i>of whether life could exist on Mars.</i>

38:09.370 --> 38:12.540
<i>Future missions can go</i>
<i>and actually look for evidence of life.</i>

38:12.624 --> 38:14.918
And maybe the best way to do that
is with humans,

38:15.001 --> 38:17.796
where they can bring samples back,
like the Apollo missions did.

38:21.591 --> 38:26.304
<i>When we put a robot on Mars</i>
<i>and we give it a name called "Curiosity",</i>

38:26.387 --> 38:29.098
and we have it send down automatic Tweets,

38:29.182 --> 38:33.353
and we love it and we call it names
like "plucky" and "tough".

38:33.436 --> 38:34.479
We're on the ground.

38:34.562 --> 38:36.731
Just don't move yet!
We gotta wait for Jace.

38:37.482 --> 38:41.820
Five, four, three, two, one!

38:41.903 --> 38:42.737
Begin!

38:47.951 --> 38:51.830
<i>We humanize robots</i>
<i>because it's the next best thing.</i>

38:51.913 --> 38:55.250
<i>But in the case of explorers</i>
<i>on other planets,</i>

38:55.333 --> 38:58.419
<i>humanizing, anthropomorphizing</i>
<i>our machines</i>

38:58.503 --> 39:01.756
are because we don't have
real people to get there.

39:05.844 --> 39:08.179
All right, lost a wheel.

39:09.222 --> 39:10.598
<i>Humans can do in a day</i>

39:10.682 --> 39:14.060
<i>what it takes a robot months</i>
<i>or sometimes years to accomplish.</i>

39:14.143 --> 39:16.855
<i>Curiosity's been on the surface</i>
<i>for a little more than three years now,</i>

39:16.938 --> 39:18.940
and we guess that a human could do that
within a week.

39:19.023 --> 39:21.484
All the science that we've done
so far in that three years,

39:21.568 --> 39:25.029
a human could walk around, chisel rocks,
look at them, investigate them.

39:25.113 --> 39:28.950
Don't move that. Don't move that.
Patrick, don't move it!

39:29.033 --> 39:30.660
Patrick, don't move it!

39:30.743 --> 39:31.578
I can get it.

39:31.661 --> 39:35.790
<i>Just kind of disappointed that our bot</i>
<i>didn't function how we wanted it to.</i>

39:35.874 --> 39:38.793
<i>It was only able to complete</i>
<i>two or three tasks,</i>

39:38.877 --> 39:42.005
<i>rather than the about six</i>
<i>that we had planned for.</i>

39:42.088 --> 39:42.964
Oh no!

39:44.757 --> 39:46.175
It's broken. Oh no!

39:47.468 --> 39:49.929
<i>I've yet to see</i>
<i>a ticker tape parade for robots.</i>

39:50.013 --> 39:51.764
<i>Or a high school named after a robot.</i>

39:51.848 --> 39:56.311
So, there's the vicarious value
that one of us experiences that

39:56.394 --> 39:57.854
and comes back to talk about it.

39:57.937 --> 39:59.647
You can touch that person.

39:59.731 --> 40:03.902
<i>And that person carried out</i>
<i>the dreams of a civilization.</i>

40:05.153 --> 40:08.239
- No!
- Yo, man. Just keep going!

40:08.323 --> 40:12.243
- Ten seconds!
- Nine, eight, seven, six...

40:12.327 --> 40:17.665
...five, four, three, two, one...

40:17.749 --> 40:19.792
- Zero!
- Stop all your robots!

40:19.876 --> 40:21.002
<i>Programming error.</i>

40:21.085 --> 40:24.797
<i>Bot didn't function properly</i>
<i>as how it was intended to.</i>

40:24.881 --> 40:29.636
<i>It didn't perform</i>
<i>as it did during testing.</i>

40:31.179 --> 40:35.850
It was really kind of down to me,
and I kind of failed at the last second.

40:46.527 --> 40:50.156
<i> The best thing about Mars</i>
<i>and why everybody wants to go to Mars</i>

40:50.239 --> 40:51.991
is because we have rovers there.

40:52.075 --> 40:54.243
We have machines, examples,

40:54.327 --> 40:59.165
everything from it that says,
"Hey come, come to Mars, come to Mars."

41:02.168 --> 41:03.670
Can this be one of our layers?

41:03.753 --> 41:06.422
Yeah! You can use that
as one of your layers!

41:06.506 --> 41:08.758
OK, we're naming it
Neil Applestrong.

41:10.510 --> 41:15.223
Applenaut training, so that's where
we have an astronaut that's a green apple

41:15.306 --> 41:16.724
and we make a space suit for it.

41:16.808 --> 41:18.977
<i> A really good way</i>
<i>to look at a space suit</i>

41:19.060 --> 41:22.897
is it has to keep you alive
with oxygen and pressure.

41:22.981 --> 41:24.273
So a one-minute test.

41:24.357 --> 41:26.693
When it comes out
you're gonna blot it dry.

41:26.776 --> 41:28.403
We'll walk over to the hot box.

41:28.987 --> 41:30.989
Go. Down, down, down.

41:31.572 --> 41:33.366
When it comes to space, I know a lot.

41:34.575 --> 41:36.077
Stop! Hold them up.

41:36.911 --> 41:38.121
Oh, no!

41:39.539 --> 41:40.498
This is unfortunate.

41:40.581 --> 41:42.333
- What?
- I think there's water inside.

41:42.417 --> 41:46.921
<i>People living in space for a year </i>
<i>now, that's huge for me. I love it.</i>

41:47.005 --> 41:51.342
And it's like, whoa! I want to
live in space for five years now!

41:54.095 --> 41:55.888
<i>To apply to become an astronaut,</i>

41:55.972 --> 41:58.516
<i>all you have to do</i>
<i>is go to the NASA website</i>

41:58.599 --> 42:02.562
and you'll find a PDF that you can
download, fill out, send back in.

42:02.645 --> 42:05.064
<i>The basic requirements to be an astronaut</i>

42:05.148 --> 42:08.192
are not actually
that difficult to achieve.

42:08.276 --> 42:13.865
<i>You need to have a four-year degree</i>
<i>in a related field of STEM:</i>

42:13.948 --> 42:16.492
<i>Science, Technology,</i>
<i>Engineering, and Math.</i>

42:16.576 --> 42:19.245
<i>You need to have things</i>
<i>such as general good health,</i>

42:19.328 --> 42:22.665
<i>reasonably good eyesight,</i>
<i>hearing, those types of things.</i>

42:23.249 --> 42:26.294
But it's when you look at
the requirements that aren't stated

42:26.377 --> 42:28.129
that things become more difficult.

42:29.756 --> 42:32.383
<i>The original group of seven folks,</i>

42:32.467 --> 42:34.969
they were all military background
when they came into the office.

42:35.053 --> 42:37.764
<i>But of course the mission</i>
<i>of actually going on to Mars</i>

42:37.847 --> 42:39.891
<i>really requires</i>
<i>a wide range of experiences,</i>

42:39.974 --> 42:43.102
<i>and so that includes medical doctors,</i>
<i>it includes scientists,</i>

42:43.186 --> 42:44.812
<i>pretty much everything under the sun.</i>

42:45.396 --> 42:47.648
I think I get smarter as I get older!

42:47.732 --> 42:49.734
<i>My time here as an astronaut</i>

42:49.817 --> 42:52.070
and my ability
to have gone to space two times

42:52.153 --> 42:54.447
has helped taken some baby steps

42:54.530 --> 42:57.742
<i>to take that next generation</i>
<i>of space explorers even further.</i>

42:59.994 --> 43:01.579
<i>I'm way too old to go to Mars.</i>

43:01.662 --> 43:05.333
25, 30 years from now,
I'm gonna be 85, 90 years-old.

43:05.416 --> 43:07.543
No way is NASA sending me to Mars.

43:09.629 --> 43:12.632
<i>The Mars Generation,</i>
<i>is the generation of today.</i>

43:12.715 --> 43:16.928
It's in their DNA to become
the astronauts, to explore the red planet.

43:17.011 --> 43:20.139
<i>Ever since I was a little kid,</i>
<i>I've wanted to be an astronaut.</i>

43:20.223 --> 43:24.769
<i>Going to Mars is definitely something that</i>
<i>would help NASA to draw public interest</i>

43:24.852 --> 43:27.313
and to reignite
that fire we have for space travel.

43:28.022 --> 43:30.358
<i>We were born</i>
<i>at exactly the right time.</i>

43:30.441 --> 43:33.903
<i>We will be in our early 30s around the</i>
<i>time we are predicted to set foot on Mars.</i>

43:33.986 --> 43:37.240
And Neil Armstrong was only 38
when he set foot on the Moon.

43:37.824 --> 43:40.660
<i>The age you should really</i>
<i>start focusing more</i>

43:40.743 --> 43:43.538
<i>and becoming really serious</i>
<i>about becoming an astronaut</i>

43:43.621 --> 43:46.415
is for me,
would probably be now,

43:46.499 --> 43:47.625
so around 14.

43:47.708 --> 43:49.502
Mainly because I'm starting to get

43:49.585 --> 43:52.171
<i>those certifications that I'll need</i>
<i>in the future,</i>

43:52.255 --> 43:54.966
<i>such as SCUBA diving certification,</i>
<i>pilot's license</i>

43:55.049 --> 43:56.717
<i>and sky diving certification.</i>

43:58.010 --> 44:02.390
<i>When I got into space heavily,</i>
<i>I was probably about 13.</i>

44:02.473 --> 44:05.017
If I had the chance to go to Mars,
I would absolutely take it.

44:05.101 --> 44:06.769
Like, I wouldn't even think about it.

44:07.395 --> 44:10.064
<i>I love space. I want to be</i>
<i>an astronaut one day.</i>

44:10.148 --> 44:13.401
If I died on Mars,
it would be sad, obviously.

44:13.484 --> 44:16.946
But at least I would have died
achieving my lifelong dream!

44:19.824 --> 44:21.951
<i>It takes</i>
<i>a certain kind of person.</i>

44:22.034 --> 44:23.286
<i>Most of us aren't those people.</i>

44:23.369 --> 44:27.373
We are fortunate, we've always been
fortunate as a species,

44:27.456 --> 44:29.375
that there are people like that.

44:30.376 --> 44:33.546
<i>We have to be honest</i>
<i>with the young generation of astronauts.</i>

44:33.629 --> 44:36.007
<i>And that is, yes, there are dangers,</i>

44:36.090 --> 44:38.426
dangers that can be quantified,

44:38.509 --> 44:43.764
but nonetheless dangers that will involve
perhaps injury, perhaps even death.

44:45.516 --> 44:49.103
All pilots learn how to
escape from a crashed helicopter.

44:49.187 --> 44:51.939
Because if you crash,
what's gonna come save you?

44:52.023 --> 44:53.274
A helicopter.

44:53.357 --> 44:56.861
What rescued the Apollo
and, before, astronauts out of the ocean?

44:56.944 --> 44:59.405
- A helicopter.
- A helicopter.

45:00.656 --> 45:03.534
When you go in, you'll receive a number,
like you were told before:

45:03.618 --> 45:05.328
one, two, three, four, five, six.

45:05.411 --> 45:08.664
You will exit in the reverse order:
six, five, four, three, two, one.

45:08.748 --> 45:10.958
There's only one place that you will exit.

45:11.042 --> 45:14.962
<i> We do water survival</i>
<i>so that we can learn what to do</i>

45:15.046 --> 45:17.131
if something goes horribly wrong.

45:17.214 --> 45:18.841
We're going down!

45:26.223 --> 45:29.644
<i>If something happens and the hatch </i>
<i>blows off of our spacecraft,</i>

45:29.727 --> 45:30.937
<i>it starts flooding,</i>

45:31.020 --> 45:34.732
you have to learn how to get out
and get out fast.

45:37.985 --> 45:39.528
Thank you, Instructor!

45:40.363 --> 45:42.031
<i>If you're in a dangerous situation</i>

45:42.114 --> 45:45.826
<i>where you're inside of a metal cage</i>
<i>and it starts filling up with water,</i>

45:45.910 --> 45:48.788
<i>you better know how to swim</i>
<i>and you better know how to get out.</i>

45:48.871 --> 45:50.957
Because you're gonna die.
Metal doesn't float.

45:51.040 --> 45:54.168
- Everybody out!
- Six out! Five, go!

45:55.878 --> 45:59.840
<i>You have to rely on your team to swim out</i>
<i>before it goes all the way under.</i>

45:59.924 --> 46:02.635
<i>And it's all about</i>
<i>getting people to work together.</i>

46:02.718 --> 46:06.222
<i>Because nobody can</i>
<i>go to space alone on their own.</i>

46:06.305 --> 46:09.350
Nobody has so far,
and I don't believe anybody will.

46:09.433 --> 46:12.061
- You all ready for this?
- Yeah, I'm pumped.

46:13.688 --> 46:16.357
I would definitely be willing to die
to go to Mars.

46:22.071 --> 46:26.242
My life is worth all the things that the
human race as a whole gain from that.

46:43.300 --> 46:45.219
<i>When we went to the Moon,</i>

46:45.302 --> 46:49.849
<i>we lost three astronauts</i>
<i>before we ever got off the ground</i>

46:49.932 --> 46:53.019
in the Apollo 1 fire on the pad.

46:54.812 --> 46:58.482
<i>It was all over</i>
<i>in one stunned, horrifying second.</i>

46:58.566 --> 47:00.860
<i>An electrical spark apparently shot out</i>

47:00.943 --> 47:04.655
<i>and ignited the 100% oxygen in the cabin</i>
<i>that they were breathing,</i>

47:04.739 --> 47:06.699
<i>as in a real spaceflight.</i>

47:06.782 --> 47:08.701
<i>The crewmen never had a chance.</i>

47:10.578 --> 47:12.705
<i>Now we come into the Space Shuttle,</i>

47:12.788 --> 47:14.707
<i>and it's supposed to be routine.</i>

47:15.666 --> 47:19.754
<i>And it's supposed to be this low incident.</i>

47:19.837 --> 47:24.925
Well, it almost happened to us
on the 24th flight.

47:25.009 --> 47:28.220
<i>Four scrubs, any one of which,</i>
<i>had we launched,</i>

47:28.304 --> 47:30.347
<i>it would have not been a good day.</i>

47:31.223 --> 47:34.268
<i>But then it happened to the 25th flight.</i>

47:34.351 --> 47:38.731
<i>Three, two, one, and liftoff.</i>

47:39.356 --> 47:43.986
<i>Liftoff of the 25th Space Shuttle mission</i>
<i>and it has cleared the tower.</i>

47:45.613 --> 47:48.741
<i> So the 25th Space Shuttle </i>
<i>mission is now on the way,</i>

47:48.824 --> 47:52.203
<i>after more delays</i>
<i>than NASA cares to count.</i>

47:52.286 --> 47:55.915
<i>This morning it looked as though</i>
<i>they were not going to be able to get off.</i>

47:57.541 --> 48:00.377
1 minute 15 seconds,
velocity 2,900 feet per second.

48:00.461 --> 48:03.798
<i>Altitude 9 nautical miles,</i>
<i>downrange just at 7 nautical miles.</i>

48:25.778 --> 48:28.572
<i>I want to say something</i>
<i>to the school children of America</i>

48:28.656 --> 48:31.575
<i>who were watching the live coverage</i>
<i>of the Shuttle's takeoff.</i>

48:32.243 --> 48:33.869
<i>I know it's hard to understand,</i>

48:33.953 --> 48:36.622
<i>but sometimes</i>
<i>painful things like this happen.</i>

48:37.248 --> 48:40.042
<i>It's all part of the process</i>
<i>of exploration and discovery.</i>

48:41.168 --> 48:45.131
It's all part of taking a chance
and expanding man's horizons.

48:45.965 --> 48:48.384
<i>The future doesn't belong</i>
<i>to the fainthearted.</i>

48:49.093 --> 48:50.386
<i>It belongs to the brave.</i>

48:59.019 --> 49:02.940
<i>What we're seeing here</i>
<i>is very ominous indeed.</i>

49:03.023 --> 49:10.030
<i>These are pictures which tell the story</i>
<i>that is clearly the Shuttle breaking up.</i>

49:10.114 --> 49:11.991
<i>Somebody once asked me,</i>

49:12.074 --> 49:16.954
"Is it possible to write an article
on three ways to make the Shuttle safer?"

49:17.037 --> 49:19.874
And my answer is
"Yes, I can write it right now.

49:19.957 --> 49:24.962
Don't fly Discovery,
don't fly Atlantis, don't fly Endeavour.

49:25.045 --> 49:26.338
Problem solved."

49:26.422 --> 49:27.256
But we flew.

49:27.339 --> 49:28.883
<i>We lost no more people</i>

49:28.966 --> 49:32.178
<i>and the program ended in</i>
<i>something close to triumph.</i>

49:32.261 --> 49:34.054
But 14 people died.

49:35.222 --> 49:37.850
<i>All three engines up and working.</i>

49:37.933 --> 49:41.478
<i>Two, one, zero. And liftoff!</i>

49:41.562 --> 49:43.814
<i>The final liftoff of Atlantis.</i>

49:43.898 --> 49:47.985
<i>On the shoulders of the Space Shuttle.</i>
<i>America will continue the dream.</i>

49:49.737 --> 49:52.656
<i>I really feel that it's</i>
<i>a part of each of our legacies</i>

49:52.740 --> 49:55.826
<i>to carry on that piece that those </i>
<i>astronauts that we lost started.</i>

49:55.910 --> 49:58.871
<i>Their legacy is</i>
<i>that we can continue the journey.</i>

49:58.954 --> 50:01.874
If we don't, we won't be able
to continue to evolve our presence

50:01.957 --> 50:04.043
in low Earth orbit and on to Mars.

50:04.126 --> 50:07.004
<i>The Space Shuttle </i>
<i>spreads its wings one final time</i>

50:07.087 --> 50:09.506
<i>for the start of a sentimental journey</i>
<i>into history.</i>

50:10.424 --> 50:11.717
<i>One of the big ideas</i>

50:11.800 --> 50:15.804
for why to retire the Shuttle
became this idea of going to Mars.

50:15.888 --> 50:17.932
<i>Let's leave low Earth orbit</i>

50:18.015 --> 50:21.101
<i>and let's start going out further</i>
<i>to explore Mars.</i>

50:21.185 --> 50:23.479
<i>Hello!</i>
<i>This is the International Space Station!</i>

50:23.562 --> 50:25.814
<i>Well this is President Obama.</i>
<i>Who am I talking to?</i>

50:26.649 --> 50:27.733
Hello, Mr. President!

50:27.816 --> 50:29.777
You're talking to the increment 28 crew

50:29.860 --> 50:31.946
and the crew
of the Space Shuttle Atlantis.

50:32.029 --> 50:35.282
<i> Well, this mission marks the</i>
<i>final flight of the Space Shuttle program.</i>

50:35.366 --> 50:41.413
<i>It also ushers in an exciting new era</i>
<i>to push the frontiers of space exploration</i>

50:41.497 --> 50:46.001
<i>and human space flight beyond Earth,</i>
<i>and ultimately sending humans to Mars.</i>

50:46.085 --> 50:48.879
One of the reasons
that the Space Shuttle had to be retired

50:48.963 --> 50:51.507
is that it was so expensive to operate

50:51.590 --> 50:55.469
that we couldn't afford to invest
in the development of its successor.

50:55.552 --> 50:57.388
That's why we've actually had a gap.

50:57.471 --> 51:00.266
<i>Having fired</i>
<i>the imagination of a generation,</i>

51:00.349 --> 51:04.186
<i>a ship like no other,</i>
<i>its place in history secured,</i>

51:04.270 --> 51:07.564
<i>the Space Shuttle pulls into port</i>
<i>for the last time.</i>

51:07.648 --> 51:10.776
<i> When the Gemini program </i>
<i>ended, no one shed a tear</i>

51:10.859 --> 51:14.822
because the mighty Saturn 5 rocket
was sitting in an adjacent launch pad

51:14.905 --> 51:18.492
ready to continue that mission,
and we knew that was going to the Moon.

51:18.575 --> 51:21.287
<i>When people shed a tear</i>
<i>for the last Shuttle landing,</i>

51:21.370 --> 51:24.999
<i>I accuse them of shedding a tear</i>
<i>not because they'd miss the Shuttle,</i>

51:25.082 --> 51:29.003
<i>but because there was not a next spaceship</i>
<i>to continue this adventure</i>

51:29.086 --> 51:32.256
that we could all then turn to and say,
"Mothball the Shuttle,

51:32.339 --> 51:34.800
we're going to the next suite
of launch vehicles."

51:34.883 --> 51:37.094
There was nothing there,
it was an empty launch pad.

51:49.815 --> 51:52.318
<i>I'm a little embarrassed</i>
<i>that to get into space</i>

51:52.401 --> 51:54.653
<i>we gotta hitch a ride with the Russians.</i>

51:54.737 --> 51:58.907
We're not even hitching a ride,
we're buying the seats on the Soyuz vessel

51:58.991 --> 52:02.077
to get to and from the International
Space Station that we built.

52:02.161 --> 52:05.039
So it's a little embarrassing!
I'll be honest with you.

52:10.544 --> 52:11.754
<i>Who'd have thought</i>

52:11.837 --> 52:14.631
<i>that with all the intense rivalry</i>
<i>with the Russians to go to the Moon</i>

52:14.715 --> 52:19.678
that we would be dependent upon
hitching a ride on the Soyuz spacecraft?

52:22.681 --> 52:26.352
<i>Let's say there's a crisis that erupts</i>
<i>some place on the planet Earth</i>

52:26.435 --> 52:30.272
and all of a sudden we're in this awkward
situation of being beholden to them

52:30.356 --> 52:32.066
for access to outer space.

52:32.149 --> 52:34.818
Perhaps that's not such a good policy.

52:38.781 --> 52:42.910
<i>It's been costly to </i>
<i>buy seats on the Soyuz from the Russians.</i>

52:42.993 --> 52:46.580
We don't like being absolutely dependent
on one other country

52:46.663 --> 52:50.793
for anything as important as being able
to get our astronauts into space.

52:52.544 --> 52:57.758
I think the idea that we have to pay
Russia $70 million

52:57.841 --> 53:02.679
to send astronauts, our astronauts,
American astronauts, to the ISS

53:02.763 --> 53:04.598
<i>is absolutely ridiculous.</i>

53:09.061 --> 53:11.980
<i>If you talk to</i>
<i>the average person on the street,</i>

53:12.064 --> 53:14.108
<i>they think the space program is over.</i>

53:14.191 --> 53:17.236
<i>They associate our space program</i>

53:17.319 --> 53:21.865
<i>with Americans flying on American rockets.</i>

53:21.949 --> 53:26.245
Not flying on the Soyuz
that we fly on right now.

53:26.954 --> 53:28.247
<i> Liftoff.</i>

53:28.330 --> 53:31.417
<i>Liftoff of the Soyuz TMA-05M</i>

53:31.500 --> 53:35.045
<i>carrying Suni Williams,</i>
<i>Yuri Malenchenko and Aki Hoshide</i>

53:35.129 --> 53:37.923
<i>on a two-day journey</i>
<i>to the International Space Station.</i>

53:38.590 --> 53:41.510
<i>The reason why we put</i>
<i>the International Space Station</i>

53:41.593 --> 53:42.803
<i>up there in the first place</i>

53:42.886 --> 53:46.765
<i>is so that we could start doing</i>
<i>long-term experiments</i>

53:46.849 --> 53:51.103
on how a human
will be able to survive in space.

53:51.186 --> 53:54.106
Because the journey to Mars
is going to take a long time.

53:54.731 --> 53:55.858
<i>You ready?</i>

53:55.941 --> 53:57.276
- <i>Yeah, go for it.</i>
<i>- Set?</i>

53:57.860 --> 54:02.156
-Go.
-Two, three, four...

54:02.573 --> 54:04.992
<i>All right, so when an astronaut</i>
<i>goes into space,</i>

54:05.075 --> 54:07.411
their body has a hard time
adjusting to the fact

54:07.494 --> 54:10.289
that now everything in their stomach
is floating around.

54:10.372 --> 54:13.917
The fluid in their ears is floating around
and that's how we sense motion.

54:14.001 --> 54:17.546
...twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen.

54:17.629 --> 54:21.592
<i>Your ears are telling you</i>
<i>that you're moving, you know,</i>

54:21.675 --> 54:23.343
<i>you're not standing still.</i>

54:23.427 --> 54:27.639
But your eyes are telling you different,
and astronauts have gotten sick from this.

54:27.723 --> 54:32.144
...41, 42, 43, 44, 45.

54:35.772 --> 54:36.940
Take off the blindfold.

54:37.566 --> 54:38.484
What?

54:40.068 --> 54:40.903
Dude.

54:43.614 --> 54:46.408
- You feel super disoriented, right?
- I'm still spinning!

54:51.455 --> 54:55.083
<i>Space, in general,</i>
<i>is a very dangerous place to go.</i>

54:55.167 --> 54:59.630
Space wasn't really meant
for humans to kind of be in.

54:59.713 --> 55:01.215
<i>Hello! I'm Suni Williams.</i>

55:01.298 --> 55:03.759
<i>I'm up here</i>
<i>on the International Space Station.</i>

55:03.842 --> 55:05.761
All right, come on back.
There's more to show you.

55:09.348 --> 55:11.016
<i>One of the things we do is we exercise.</i>

55:11.099 --> 55:14.603
We have some exercise equipment
onboard the Space Station.

55:14.686 --> 55:17.606
<i>A lot of our research up on </i>
<i>the International Space Station right now</i>

55:17.689 --> 55:21.401
<i>is looking at ways to minimize</i>
<i>muscle loss, to minimize bone loss,</i>

55:21.485 --> 55:24.905
<i>to minimize the effects</i>
<i>of radiation on the astronauts.</i>

55:24.988 --> 55:26.490
<i>And why do we do this today?</i>

55:26.573 --> 55:29.535
It's all in regard to
these future missions going to Mars.

55:29.618 --> 55:32.120
<i> You might have noticed</i>
<i>a little moon on the outside.</i>

55:32.204 --> 55:37.084
This is our orbital outhouse right here.
It serves for two functions.

55:37.167 --> 55:41.255
And, of course, you do have your privacy.
There's a little door.

55:41.713 --> 55:46.260
One of the really important things about
living and working in space long term

55:46.343 --> 55:50.264
is to learn how to recycle
all the things you need,

55:50.347 --> 55:52.641
rather than bring them up
from the Earth.

55:52.724 --> 55:56.520
<i>Some of the obstacles that</i>
<i>we face heading to Mars is we need water.</i>

55:56.603 --> 55:58.063
<i>Water is a major resource.</i>

55:58.146 --> 56:00.107
Right now, we're working
with the ECLSS system

56:00.190 --> 56:03.193
where we can turn
our own urine into water.

56:03.277 --> 56:07.239
- Oh, lost volume, OK I got you.
- We lost like a few milligrams.

56:09.032 --> 56:12.494
The thing is, if we were to use the cotton
we would lose so much.

56:12.578 --> 56:16.206
<i>ECLSS is the Environmental</i>
<i>Control and Life Support System.</i>

56:16.290 --> 56:19.209
<i>It is the way that astronauts breathe</i>

56:19.293 --> 56:22.045
and it purifies the water
on the ISS for them.

56:23.046 --> 56:25.632
It's still at 100.
Where's ammonia?

56:26.133 --> 56:28.385
-Somewhere.
-Yeah, ammo chips.

56:28.468 --> 56:32.514
<i>Mars is the next place</i>
<i>that we should explore,</i>

56:32.598 --> 56:36.685
because we've already been to the Moon
and Mars just seems like the next step.

56:36.768 --> 56:39.855
I want to test the pasta cause
it could absorb some of the color.

56:39.938 --> 56:41.273
That's what I'm thinking.

56:41.356 --> 56:42.983
<i>Mars has so many cool things.</i>

56:43.066 --> 56:47.446
Like it has water and the possibility
of old extraterrestrial life

56:47.529 --> 56:49.698
that doesn't exist there anymore.

56:49.781 --> 56:54.286
So it would be great to see if we could
find some answers to all of that.

56:54.369 --> 56:59.249
-I think maybe gravel and then charcoal.
-And then ammonia and then sand.

57:00.167 --> 57:02.336
Oh look at, look at
the color in this itself.

57:02.419 --> 57:04.671
It doesn't actually retain
any of the water.

57:06.506 --> 57:09.885
Right now we're filtering water.
So we have this terrible mix of water.

57:09.968 --> 57:11.219
It's got like a pH of three.

57:11.303 --> 57:13.388
It's not even water.
It's just like poison.

57:13.472 --> 57:17.392
<i>They hinted that we are going to</i>
<i>take this water, make our own filters,</i>

57:17.476 --> 57:18.602
<i>and then drink it,</i>

57:18.685 --> 57:21.605
<i>and hopefully</i>
<i>it's not terrible and kills us.</i>

57:21.688 --> 57:24.566
That'd be very much appreciated
if we don't die from it.

57:24.650 --> 57:28.195
Water used to be delivered
in water-filled bags like this one.

57:28.278 --> 57:33.867
<i>But since 2010, we got a system onboard</i>
<i>that can purify the water real time.</i>

57:33.951 --> 57:36.286
<i>We have filters</i>
<i>and a keg-size distiller</i>

57:36.370 --> 57:40.791
<i>that, with it, we can recycle about</i>
<i>6,000 liters of extra water each year.</i>

57:40.874 --> 57:42.960
Right now,
we're holding acidic water.

57:43.043 --> 57:45.420
And our hopes are
that lima beans are basic

57:45.504 --> 57:49.216
and will counteract
the acidity in this disgusting mess.

57:49.299 --> 57:51.843
We're running it through
the lima beans three times,

57:51.927 --> 57:54.221
and then we're gonna
test the pH afterwards.

57:54.304 --> 57:58.308
By some miracle, the water will be
slightly more basic than we started out.

57:59.977 --> 58:01.853
<i>I actually care a lot about this.</i>

58:01.937 --> 58:05.857
I feel like clean water
is probably the most important thing ever.

58:05.941 --> 58:08.652
Just because, at least here on Earth,

58:08.735 --> 58:13.031
we still have over a billion people
who don't have access to clean water.

58:13.657 --> 58:16.493
I want to say four.
That's a solid acidic of four.

58:16.576 --> 58:19.287
<i>We can accomplish</i>
<i>so much in such little time,</i>

58:19.371 --> 58:20.914
<i>like landing on the Moon.</i>

58:20.998 --> 58:25.002
<i>People need to understand going to Mars,</i>
<i>it's gonna be an expensive mission.</i>

58:25.085 --> 58:28.922
But the technologies
that we'll develop from that itself

58:29.006 --> 58:31.091
will pay off all that cost

58:31.174 --> 58:34.886
because it'll pump new technologies
and more industries into our economy.

58:40.934 --> 58:45.355
<i>Most people don't realize how much</i>
<i>NASA has done for us and for our society.</i>

58:45.439 --> 58:48.859
<i>When you look at</i>
<i>the lives that we live right now,</i>

58:48.942 --> 58:51.695
they wouldn't be possible without NASA.

58:51.778 --> 58:57.451
<i>CAT scans, MRIs,</i>
<i>the small cameras in our iPhones.</i>

58:57.534 --> 59:01.496
All of this has originated
in our U.S. space program.

59:02.289 --> 59:04.207
<i>The Apollo program alone</i>

59:04.291 --> 59:06.835
<i>was the reason computers</i>
<i>took the advances to where they are.</i>

59:06.918 --> 59:09.546
<i>So if we go to Mars,</i>
<i>I'm sure we're gonna get tech advances</i>

59:09.629 --> 59:12.090
in ways that we can't even fathom.

59:14.301 --> 59:20.057
One of the things Mars can offer us
is growth and stimulation of the economy.

59:21.850 --> 59:25.562
<i>People say "Oh, what is</i>
<i>the space program really doing for us?</i>

59:25.645 --> 59:28.648
We spend all these tax dollars
into NASA. What does it give us?"

59:28.732 --> 59:33.070
Space travel has one of
the highest rates of return on money

59:33.153 --> 59:34.154
<i>that we put into it.</i>

59:39.826 --> 59:42.913
<i>The space program</i>
<i>has more than paid for itself.</i>

59:42.996 --> 59:46.541
<i>Telecommunications, the internet,</i>
<i>weather satellites,</i>

59:46.625 --> 59:49.669
<i>all of it done in outer space.</i>

59:49.753 --> 59:52.130
<i>In fact, if you shut down</i>
<i>the space program,</i>

59:52.214 --> 59:55.801
we would be hurled back
almost a century into the past.

59:59.221 --> 01:00:01.098
Everybody in space, please listen up.

01:00:01.181 --> 01:00:03.558
Whenever we approach
whatever that payload is,

01:00:03.642 --> 01:00:05.519
we need to be wearing protective gear.

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:08.021
Make it very clear
we will wear protective gear

01:00:08.105 --> 01:00:09.564
in the search for the payload.

01:00:09.648 --> 01:00:13.318
<i>I think we should go to Mars</i>
<i>because we can.</i>

01:00:13.401 --> 01:00:15.362
<i>We can do all these things.</i>

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:18.240
And it's just, I feel like
it's kind of sad that we haven't already.

01:00:18.323 --> 01:00:21.368
Because we have developed
technologies to do things like this.

01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:23.829
We definitely have the intelligence.

01:00:23.912 --> 01:00:26.456
The biggest thing we're missing
is public support.

01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:28.625
I'm gonna write down
some information for you.

01:00:28.708 --> 01:00:31.795
If they have to do an ISS reboot...
Get a piece of paper ready.

01:00:31.878 --> 01:00:38.051
I know people who think
that NASA was mothballed.

01:00:38.135 --> 01:00:40.595
NASA doesn't exist anymore.
NASA's out of business.

01:00:40.679 --> 01:00:44.015
That, in and of itself, is sad.

01:00:44.099 --> 01:00:48.770
I think right now we should be monitoring,
cabin pressure, O2, that kind of stuff.

01:00:48.854 --> 01:00:51.731
And I'm gonna be needing to do
med checks soon, just to see.

01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:54.860
All right. And use all the computers
to monitor vital systems.

01:00:54.943 --> 01:00:58.071
<i>Space is always there.</i>
<i>Space is a constant presence.</i>

01:00:58.155 --> 01:01:02.075
When people ask me,
"Isn't that not really a thing anymore?

01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:04.786
We don't go to space anymore."
I'm always taken aback.

01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:08.623
<i>It makes me feel like people</i>
<i>are losing touch with their human spirit.</i>

01:01:08.707 --> 01:01:12.335
Is there any information of what this
confidential payload may look like?

01:01:12.419 --> 01:01:14.921
The information we have
is that it's experimental.

01:01:15.005 --> 01:01:17.674
It can pretty much go anywhere,
do anything.

01:01:17.757 --> 01:01:20.093
It is not contained and it is dangerous.

01:01:20.177 --> 01:01:22.637
<i>You need to protect yourselves</i>
<i>and be very careful.</i>

01:01:23.805 --> 01:01:24.973
We're on the look.

01:01:25.056 --> 01:01:26.266
<i>We don't have a shuttle.</i>

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:29.519
<i>We don't have any way to get to space</i>
<i>ourselves right now.</i>

01:01:29.603 --> 01:01:33.815
But I do believe that
the U.S. space system, it's still a force.

01:01:41.072 --> 01:01:43.366
<i>I know there have been</i>
<i>a number of questions raised</i>

01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:46.161
<i>about my administration's plan</i>
<i>for space exploration,</i>

01:01:46.244 --> 01:01:48.914
<i>and these questions come</i>
<i>at a time of transition.</i>

01:01:48.997 --> 01:01:50.916
And in order to reach the Space Station,

01:01:50.999 --> 01:01:54.211
we will work with
a growing array of private companies

01:01:54.294 --> 01:01:58.632
competing to make getting to space
easier and more affordable.

01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:00.342
<i>The next President of the U.S.,</i>

01:02:00.425 --> 01:02:03.553
they will have two American companies,
Boeing and SpaceX,

01:02:03.637 --> 01:02:05.972
that will launch from the space coast

01:02:06.056 --> 01:02:09.976
<i>carrying the first-ever</i>
<i>commercial crew vehicles</i>

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:13.396
<i>that are gonna carry Americans</i>
<i>to the International Space Station.</i>

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:16.983
By buying the services
of space transportation,

01:02:17.067 --> 01:02:18.985
rather than the vehicles themselves,

01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:20.987
<i>we can accelerate the pace of innovations,</i>

01:02:21.071 --> 01:02:25.075
<i>as companies, from young startups</i>
<i>to established leaders,</i>

01:02:25.158 --> 01:02:27.619
compete to design and build and launch

01:02:27.702 --> 01:02:30.705
new means of carrying people
and materials out of our atmosphere.

01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:33.124
<i> We cannot do</i>
<i>deep space exploration,</i>

01:02:33.208 --> 01:02:35.752
<i>particularly with humans,</i>
<i>without these partnerships.</i>

01:02:35.835 --> 01:02:38.713
<i>They're carrying our astronauts</i>
<i>to the International Space Station.</i>

01:02:38.797 --> 01:02:43.176
And all of this is in preparation for,
or as a part, of the journey to Mars.

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:46.388
We expect new spacecraft
designed for long journeys

01:02:46.471 --> 01:02:51.184
to allow us to begin the first-ever crewed
missions beyond the Moon into deep space.

01:02:51.268 --> 01:02:55.397
<i>Because exploration will once more</i>
<i>inspire wonder in a new generation.</i>

01:02:56.106 --> 01:02:57.857
<i>The SLS Space Launch System</i>

01:02:57.941 --> 01:03:00.485
is a new way for people to get to space.

01:03:02.862 --> 01:03:05.448
<i>There's a lot more of space to explore,</i>

01:03:05.532 --> 01:03:07.701
<i>and a lot more to learn when we do.</i>

01:03:07.784 --> 01:03:10.495
The Space Launch System
is the new rocket for the agency.

01:03:10.578 --> 01:03:13.456
It can take us to Mars.
It can take us to deep space.

01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:16.918
<i> We're gonna have the largest,</i>
<i>most powerful rocket ever known to man.</i>

01:03:17.002 --> 01:03:20.463
<i>I don't think there is</i>
<i>another vehicle on the drawing board</i>

01:03:20.547 --> 01:03:24.384
that matches the capability that SLS has.

01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:29.222
<i>The way NASA</i>
<i>is planning on getting to Mars</i>

01:03:29.306 --> 01:03:31.474
is using the SLS
Space Launch System rocket.

01:03:31.558 --> 01:03:34.853
<i>The SLS crew compartment will go to space.</i>

01:03:34.936 --> 01:03:37.814
<i>And then the Orion capsule,</i>
<i>which will be on top,</i>

01:03:37.897 --> 01:03:41.526
<i>will separate and start heading</i>
<i>towards the trajectory of Mars.</i>

01:03:44.487 --> 01:03:46.656
<i>When you look at the Orion crew module,</i>

01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:50.952
<i>you notice that it looks like</i>
<i>the shape of the Apollo capsule.</i>

01:03:51.036 --> 01:03:54.581
But the reason that shape is used
is because the physics haven't changed.

01:03:57.334 --> 01:04:01.963
We're going to Mars.
It'll be in the decade of the 2030s.

01:04:02.047 --> 01:04:07.969
<i>And we're building the systems,</i>
<i>the hardware, that will get us there.</i>

01:04:08.053 --> 01:04:09.971
<i>By the mid 2030s,</i>

01:04:10.055 --> 01:04:14.309
<i>I believe we can send humans to orbit Mars</i>
<i>and return them safely to Earth.</i>

01:04:15.226 --> 01:04:19.189
And a landing on Mars will follow.
And I expect to be around to see it.

01:04:28.782 --> 01:04:31.326
Let's have one person
from each engineering team

01:04:31.409 --> 01:04:32.786
come and get your tray.

01:04:33.578 --> 01:04:36.039
Right now, NASA is working
on the Orion capsule

01:04:36.122 --> 01:04:37.791
which is going to take us to Mars.

01:04:37.874 --> 01:04:41.127
Two things of aluminum foil,
a cork, and some spackle.

01:04:41.211 --> 01:04:43.630
OK, so this is how thick we have.
Can I take this for a minute?

01:04:43.713 --> 01:04:45.340
We'll come back to that when we spackle.

01:04:45.423 --> 01:04:49.552
- Yeah. Do we just spackle it right here?
- Is that everything we have?

01:04:49.636 --> 01:04:50.887
That's everything.

01:04:50.970 --> 01:04:53.932
<i>People have been talking</i>
<i>about going to Mars</i>

01:04:54.015 --> 01:04:56.101
pretty much since we landed on the Moon

01:04:56.184 --> 01:04:58.853
and discovered that Mars
is another solid surface.

01:04:58.937 --> 01:05:01.481
-Thanks. OK. Great.
-Build this thing, baby!

01:05:01.564 --> 01:05:04.234
A little color. Liven it up!

01:05:08.822 --> 01:05:13.076
Ablative shielding is a very basic
demonstration of thermodynamics.

01:05:13.159 --> 01:05:14.536
Do you want to go get it?

01:05:14.619 --> 01:05:17.705
-I got it!
-OK. Have fun.

01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:20.583
The pasta actually works pretty well.
And I'm not sure why.

01:05:20.667 --> 01:05:22.210
<i> There are different materials</i>

01:05:22.293 --> 01:05:25.004
<i>that work in different ways,</i>
<i>things that you'd never even think of.</i>

01:05:25.088 --> 01:05:26.798
Who thinks of using a sponge

01:05:26.881 --> 01:05:33.888
<i>to stop a 3,500 degree Fahrenheit flame</i>
<i>from burning through a spaceship?</i>

01:05:33.972 --> 01:05:34.806
Who thinks of that?

01:05:34.889 --> 01:05:36.474
I feel like this is very sturdy.

01:05:38.017 --> 01:05:40.603
On Orion you're going to Mars,

01:05:40.687 --> 01:05:46.276
so not only are you entering and exiting
the atmosphere in the Earth,

01:05:46.359 --> 01:05:50.196
but you're also entering and exiting
the atmosphere on Mars.

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:53.241
So it's twice as important
that you have it

01:05:53.324 --> 01:05:55.326
because you need to be safe!

01:05:57.787 --> 01:05:59.998
I feel like NASA's gonna call us...

01:06:00.999 --> 01:06:03.460
- ...after this.
- Future rocket scientists.

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:08.965
<i>The reason the heat shield is so important</i>

01:06:09.048 --> 01:06:13.136
is because when you go to Mars
the heat generated is very intense.

01:06:13.219 --> 01:06:15.597
So, a lot of care
goes into the heat shield.

01:06:16.973 --> 01:06:19.267
<i> The heat shield</i>
<i>gets almost 4,000 degrees,</i>

01:06:19.350 --> 01:06:21.394
<i>as it ablates all of that energy.</i>

01:06:21.478 --> 01:06:23.688
Yet inside the crew module
it's room temperature.

01:06:23.771 --> 01:06:24.856
It's just like in here.

01:06:26.691 --> 01:06:28.610
I think we're feeling pretty confident.

01:06:28.693 --> 01:06:30.153
Ours is destined to survive.

01:06:30.236 --> 01:06:32.071
Failure is not an option for us.

01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:35.366
Hey, I believe in it.

01:06:41.539 --> 01:06:43.583
-So far so good!
-That's how good ours is!

01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:46.211
-Propane's afraid to start.
-Yeah, really!

01:06:46.294 --> 01:06:48.129
<i>My team this year is really amazing.</i>

01:06:48.213 --> 01:06:51.090
I could not have asked
to be put with a better group of kids.

01:06:51.174 --> 01:06:54.302
<i>The vast commonology of space</i>
<i>does bring us together.</i>

01:06:55.512 --> 01:06:56.429
OK...

01:06:57.222 --> 01:06:58.181
Oh, man.

01:06:58.264 --> 01:07:00.558
- Ooh, it's very concentrated!
- It's cooking.

01:07:00.642 --> 01:07:02.685
Look at that heat dispersion. See that?

01:07:04.562 --> 01:07:06.147
I'm seeing some smoke!

01:07:08.358 --> 01:07:11.653
At school I do sometimes feel like
the odd man out,

01:07:11.736 --> 01:07:14.572
because I'm very much into space.

01:07:14.656 --> 01:07:15.698
Come on, come on...

01:07:15.782 --> 01:07:17.617
-Yikes!
-We're hitting steel.

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:23.957
I was bullied since third grade,
and that has definitely taken a toll.

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:24.874
Don't jinx it!

01:07:24.958 --> 01:07:27.544
The foil is starting to come out,
like the heat.

01:07:27.627 --> 01:07:30.255
<i>One time, we were doing</i>
<i>an experiment in science class</i>

01:07:30.338 --> 01:07:33.716
and my partner picked me because
she said apparently I looked smart.

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:37.095
I wound up doing all the work.

01:07:37.762 --> 01:07:39.639
- Oh, that's not good.
- That's not good.

01:07:40.848 --> 01:07:43.226
<i>When I would ask her about something,</i>

01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:46.437
<i>she would just be like,</i>
<i>"Don't fail me and I'll be fine."</i>

01:07:48.231 --> 01:07:49.524
No. That's how much we've gone.

01:07:49.607 --> 01:07:51.401
-I was like--
-It's only been 46?! Wow!

01:07:51.484 --> 01:07:52.652
- Wow!
- Wow!

01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:55.154
But then I come here
and I just meet these people

01:07:55.238 --> 01:07:59.867
and it's like you can just be yourself
and be goofy and be funny,

01:07:59.951 --> 01:08:02.370
while still learning about space.

01:08:03.413 --> 01:08:05.123
<i>I am definitely a space nerd.</i>

01:08:05.206 --> 01:08:09.210
It's just this weird love and excitement

01:08:09.294 --> 01:08:14.132
and, you know, geeking out about
certain details of space exploration.

01:08:14.215 --> 01:08:16.676
You know, being impressed
and excited by it.

01:08:16.759 --> 01:08:19.470
I think that's what
being a space nerd means to me.

01:08:19.554 --> 01:08:22.390
It's a real honor
to be recognized by your peers.

01:08:22.473 --> 01:08:25.100
And, honestly, to be recognized
by this group of people

01:08:25.184 --> 01:08:29.397
and the entire Space Camp community
is... It's pretty awesome.

01:08:29.479 --> 01:08:32.274
So I went to Space Camp
in the summer of 1995

01:08:32.358 --> 01:08:36.112
and it was, you know,
definitely a life changing experience.

01:08:36.194 --> 01:08:39.657
So I'll begin with a story.
I had my first kiss at Space Camp.

01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:45.162
<i>One of the amazing things about Space Camp</i>
<i>was finding all these other space nerds,</i>

01:08:45.246 --> 01:08:49.292
finding my, you know,
my group, my people.

01:08:49.375 --> 01:08:51.502
Honestly, you know, like so many things,

01:08:51.586 --> 01:08:55.548
being here helped open the path for me
to do things that I really wanted to do,

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:57.759
to be, you know, the engineer
that I am today,

01:08:57.841 --> 01:09:00.761
to work with the amazing team of people
that I get to work with.

01:09:00.845 --> 01:09:04.432
To have this community is great,
and so thank you so much.

01:09:04.515 --> 01:09:06.059
And to that girl that I kissed,

01:09:06.142 --> 01:09:09.312
I'm a lot better kisser
and engineer nowadays, so thank you.

01:09:10.979 --> 01:09:17.487
Eight, seven, six, five,
four, three, two, one!

01:09:17.569 --> 01:09:20.156
Parachutes deploy! Reentry!
Success!

01:09:20.238 --> 01:09:22.241
- We didn't land in the swamp!
- Wait

01:09:23.326 --> 01:09:24.618
He's alive!

01:09:24.702 --> 01:09:27.162
-Whoo! Way to go, Egbert!
-Did it burn through the shield?

01:09:27.246 --> 01:09:30.375
-Are they going to crack it to see?
-It didn't even burn through the shield.

01:09:30.457 --> 01:09:32.042
Pretty cool to the touch.

01:09:32.710 --> 01:09:35.546
- The yolk even survived!
- Yes, you're good. Good job.

01:09:36.589 --> 01:09:38.633
-All right!
-What layer did it get through?

01:09:38.716 --> 01:09:40.843
-High fives all around.
-High fives all around!

01:09:40.926 --> 01:09:42.929
Where was your...
what was your second layer?

01:09:43.011 --> 01:09:44.514
<i>The coolest thing about space?</i>

01:09:44.596 --> 01:09:45.973
I don't exactly know.

01:09:46.057 --> 01:09:49.560
It's really hard to say
the coolest thing about space.

01:09:51.062 --> 01:09:54.357
<i>One of my favorite things to do</i>
<i>is sometimes when I'm out late at night,</i>

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:55.942
is to look up at the night sky

01:09:56.025 --> 01:09:59.487
and try to find the little red planet
in the sky if I can.

01:10:10.289 --> 01:10:14.669
<i> When I look at Mars,</i>
<i>in some sense I see our future.</i>

01:10:14.752 --> 01:10:17.255
<i>Because it's practically a law of physics</i>

01:10:17.338 --> 01:10:22.969
that one day the Earth will no longer
be able to sustain life as we know it.

01:10:27.056 --> 01:10:30.351
<i>The Earth is not a safe place.</i>

01:10:30.435 --> 01:10:35.064
<i>On a scale of millions of years,</i>
<i>there could be a killer asteroid.</i>

01:10:35.148 --> 01:10:39.652
And just remember, the dinosaurs
did not have a space program.

01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:45.867
<i>On a scale of thousands of years,</i>
<i>there could be another ice age,</i>

01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:49.996
<i>another ice age that will force humanity</i>
<i>to live, perhaps, deep underground,</i>

01:10:50.079 --> 01:10:52.165
or even leave the Earth itself.

01:10:57.837 --> 01:11:01.674
<i>Our entire species</i>
<i>is contained to Earth.</i>

01:11:01.758 --> 01:11:04.010
<i>If something happens to Earth...</i>
<i>Poof, we're gone.</i>

01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:07.096
<i>Think about what that means.</i>
<i>That means all music is gone.</i>

01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:09.140
<i>All laughter is forever gone.</i>

01:11:09.223 --> 01:11:13.019
Shakespeare's gone. Mozart's gone.
Basketball's gone.

01:11:13.102 --> 01:11:17.190
Everything that has to do with humanity
is just gone forever. That's it.

01:11:23.196 --> 01:11:26.157
<i>We as a species</i>
<i>need to live on multiple planets.</i>

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:28.326
<i>As it sits, we're all on one planet.</i>

01:11:28.409 --> 01:11:31.454
<i>There could be a war.</i>
<i>There could be a plague.</i>

01:11:31.537 --> 01:11:33.915
It is possible for humanity
to be wiped out.

01:11:37.877 --> 01:11:41.380
<i>On a scale of decades,</i>
<i>we also have climate change.</i>

01:11:41.464 --> 01:11:43.841
<i>If you take a look at all the signs,</i>

01:11:43.925 --> 01:11:47.178
all the signs point up,
in terms of temperature.

01:11:49.889 --> 01:11:52.391
<i>Our space assets</i>
<i>monitor carbon dioxide,</i>

01:11:52.475 --> 01:11:55.102
<i>they monitor the thickness of glaciers.</i>

01:11:55.186 --> 01:11:58.606
And we can see that humankind
is changing the climate.

01:12:00.441 --> 01:12:02.819
<i>We're not dumping a lot</i>
<i>into alternative energy.</i>

01:12:02.902 --> 01:12:06.823
We're cutting down rainforests,
we're using up a lot of natural habitats.

01:12:10.326 --> 01:12:12.286
A lot of problems
with climate change are alarming

01:12:12.370 --> 01:12:15.498
because we're finding
these things are not reversible.

01:12:15.581 --> 01:12:18.334
<i>So, by exploring space,</i>
<i>we can either find somewhere to go,</i>

01:12:18.417 --> 01:12:21.462
<i>or we can develop technologies</i>
<i>that will help us repair</i>

01:12:21.546 --> 01:12:22.922
<i>what damage we've done.</i>

01:12:29.595 --> 01:12:34.100
<i>T minus ten, nine, eight, seven,</i>

01:12:34.183 --> 01:12:37.228
<i>six, five, four,</i>

01:12:37.311 --> 01:12:39.647
<i>three, two, one.</i>

01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:52.118
It's not clear
that the Space Launch System

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:54.787
is still on schedule and still on budget,

01:12:54.871 --> 01:12:58.040
and this is a concern for everybody.

01:13:01.377 --> 01:13:06.173
The SLS, it's an interesting machine,
to say the least.

01:13:06.257 --> 01:13:09.635
Almost all of its technologies
are derived from the Space Shuttle.

01:13:09.719 --> 01:13:12.847
<i>Its engine's the RS25,</i>

01:13:12.930 --> 01:13:16.225
<i>the same engine that we were running</i>
<i>for 30 years on the Space Shuttle.</i>

01:13:17.018 --> 01:13:23.649
I'm a little bit disappointed that no
new technology really went into making it.

01:13:25.443 --> 01:13:27.111
<i> The SLS can get us to Mars.</i>

01:13:27.194 --> 01:13:29.405
The SLS most assuredly can get us to Mars.

01:13:29.488 --> 01:13:32.825
<i>But the problem with the SLS,</i>
<i>the Space Launch System,</i>

01:13:32.909 --> 01:13:34.577
<i>the 21st century Saturn 5</i>

01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:38.831
<i>and Orion,</i>
<i>which is the 21st century Apollo program,</i>

01:13:38.915 --> 01:13:44.879
is that there simply isn't the money
to get them built and tested and flying

01:13:44.962 --> 01:13:47.381
in any kind of near term timeframe.

01:13:48.549 --> 01:13:50.968
<i>NASA can say</i>
<i>that Mars is in our portfolio.</i>

01:13:51.052 --> 01:13:54.096
<i>We're gonna send astronauts there</i>
<i>in the 2030s.</i>

01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:56.974
OK, show me the money.
Talk is cheap.

01:13:57.058 --> 01:13:59.226
So we can talk about going to Mars,

01:13:59.310 --> 01:14:04.815
but until I see the launch pad with
the spaceship equipped to accomplish that,

01:14:04.899 --> 01:14:08.110
I'm not gonna run around saying
"Yeah, we are the Mars people."

01:14:08.194 --> 01:14:10.780
No we're not. Not until that happens.

01:14:10.863 --> 01:14:11.822
<i> Go ahead.</i>

01:14:11.906 --> 01:14:15.451
In my industry one of our biggest
victories was putting a man on the Moon.

01:14:15.534 --> 01:14:18.371
-Yeah.
-What do you think about humans on Mars?

01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:21.916
Honestly, I think it's wonderful.

01:14:21.999 --> 01:14:24.961
I want to rebuild
our infrastructure first, OK?

01:14:25.336 --> 01:14:26.504
I think it's wonderful.

01:14:28.923 --> 01:14:29.757
Go ahead.

01:14:32.468 --> 01:14:35.012
NASA's not in charge,
it's at the whim of government.

01:14:35.096 --> 01:14:37.181
So every time
there's a change in presidents,

01:14:37.264 --> 01:14:39.684
<i>there's a lot of changes at NASA, </i>
<i>automatically.</i>

01:14:41.102 --> 01:14:42.353
Thank you, everybody!

01:14:42.436 --> 01:14:45.022
We're not, we are not going to be
taking any questions.

01:14:45.106 --> 01:14:46.023
Thank you, guys!

01:14:46.107 --> 01:14:47.358
<i>We are building the SLS,</i>

01:14:47.441 --> 01:14:51.904
but at the rate we're going right now,
it won't be done until I'm like 40 or 50.

01:14:51.988 --> 01:14:54.365
They keep saying my generation
is the Mars Generation,

01:14:54.448 --> 01:14:55.783
but we're not at this rate.

01:14:55.866 --> 01:14:59.537
We could be if we gave them the same
support we showed the Apollo program.

01:15:00.788 --> 01:15:02.957
<i> During the Apollo era, everybody,</i>

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:07.461
<i>NASA was funded</i>
<i>at 4% of the federal budget.</i>

01:15:08.671 --> 01:15:11.757
<i>Today, it's 0.4%,</i>

01:15:11.841 --> 01:15:15.386
<i>almost exactly a tenth of what it was</i>
<i>during the Apollo era.</i>

01:15:15.469 --> 01:15:18.431
And that's not gonna change.
That's the way it is right now.

01:15:20.808 --> 01:15:22.727
<i>NASA is handcuffed</i>
<i>to the U.S. budget.</i>

01:15:22.810 --> 01:15:25.896
<i>The U.S. budget has a thousand claws on it</i>
<i>trying to get the money.</i>

01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:29.650
<i>For NASA to innovate, for NASA to do</i>
<i>amazing things that it would like to do,</i>

01:15:29.734 --> 01:15:31.694
it needs an insane budget.

01:15:31.777 --> 01:15:35.614
It needs a far different budget
than the other kind of agencies.

01:15:37.116 --> 01:15:39.410
<i> NASA, all of the money</i>
<i>they have ever received</i>

01:15:39.493 --> 01:15:40.995
<i>from the government combined,</i>

01:15:41.078 --> 01:15:43.664
<i>is still less</i>
<i>than the yearly budget of the D.O.D.</i>

01:15:44.582 --> 01:15:46.667
Which is kind of appalling to me.

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:53.299
<i>SLS and Orion are cool.</i>

01:15:53.382 --> 01:15:55.426
<i>I mean, if you like rockets,</i>
<i>they're gonna be awesome.</i>

01:15:55.509 --> 01:15:57.762
<i>They're gonna have</i>
<i>immense amount of thrust.</i>

01:15:57.845 --> 01:16:00.556
But they haven't done
the important innovation,

01:16:00.639 --> 01:16:03.517
which is that they're still
super crazy expensive.

01:16:09.398 --> 01:16:13.110
<i>If every time you flew in an airplane,</i>
<i>you landed, the passengers got out,</i>

01:16:13.194 --> 01:16:15.905
<i>and the plane was thrown away</i>
<i>cause planes flew once,</i>

01:16:15.988 --> 01:16:20.493
<i>well, it would cost a million</i>
<i>and a half dollars for a coach seat.</i>

01:16:20.576 --> 01:16:23.537
No one would fly.
It would be a zero industry.

01:16:23.621 --> 01:16:26.832
It would be for crazy billionaires only.

01:16:26.916 --> 01:16:30.169
That's the current state
of our aerospace industry.

01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:37.426
<i>There is a nasty four-letter </i>
<i>word that has haunted the space program.</i>

01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:40.096
It's the "C" word.
"Cost".

01:16:40.179 --> 01:16:42.932
Imagine your body made out of solid gold.

01:16:43.015 --> 01:16:46.644
That's what it costs
to put you up in outer space.

01:16:46.727 --> 01:16:49.563
<i>That's why we have to drive down the cost.</i>

01:16:55.319 --> 01:16:58.823
<i> You can improve incrementally</i>
<i>when it comes to getting off of Earth</i>

01:16:58.906 --> 01:17:01.283
<i>with cheaper rockets</i>
<i>and maybe better fuel.</i>

01:17:01.367 --> 01:17:04.995
But what was needed
was like a giant leap forward

01:17:05.079 --> 01:17:06.413
in the cost of space travel.

01:17:06.497 --> 01:17:08.249
And there really was one way to do that.

01:17:08.332 --> 01:17:12.169
<i>And it was the fact</i>
<i>that every rocket was used once.</i>

01:17:13.504 --> 01:17:17.675
There's a debate as to whether private
enterprise or the federal government

01:17:17.758 --> 01:17:19.301
can create innovation.

01:17:20.678 --> 01:17:22.054
<i> Privatization of space.</i>

01:17:22.138 --> 01:17:25.724
This is a very interesting subject,
to say the least.

01:17:25.808 --> 01:17:28.018
<i> The private space industry</i>
<i>is a direct result</i>

01:17:28.102 --> 01:17:31.313
of NASA not being able to fund
everything it wants to do.

01:17:31.397 --> 01:17:33.691
I don't think it's a bad thing,
it's a good thing.

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:39.530
<i>NASA has a lot of leadership </i>
<i>potential and a lot of budget potential.</i>

01:17:39.613 --> 01:17:41.824
<i>And it can use it</i>
<i>to partner with these companies.</i>

01:17:41.907 --> 01:17:45.202
Rather than fight against these companies
and make its own rocket,

01:17:45.286 --> 01:17:48.664
<i>let the private companies</i>
<i>fight for who has the best rocket,</i>

01:17:48.747 --> 01:17:53.919
<i>and then NASA will use that best rocket</i>
<i>to do its business in space and in Mars.</i>

01:17:55.713 --> 01:17:59.466
<i>Welcome to the live webcast</i>
<i>of the SpaceX launch of the ORBCOM mission</i>

01:17:59.550 --> 01:18:02.678
from Launch Complex 40
out of Cape Canaveral, Florida.

01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:09.059
<i>Elon Musk of SpaceX,</i>

01:18:09.143 --> 01:18:12.563
he asked, "What is it
we need to do to go to Mars?"

01:18:12.646 --> 01:18:15.024
And people told him,
these are experts told him,

01:18:15.107 --> 01:18:18.777
"We need to lower the cost
of getting into low Earth orbit."

01:18:22.031 --> 01:18:24.450
<i>Elon thinks of Earth as a hard drive,</i>

01:18:24.533 --> 01:18:27.328
<i>and he thinks of humanity as</i>
<i>a very important file on that hard drive,</i>

01:18:27.411 --> 01:18:30.164
and Elon looks at the history
of mass extinction events

01:18:30.247 --> 01:18:32.333
and sees the hard drive
has a tendency to crash.

01:18:34.627 --> 01:18:37.671
Some people think it's fine,
just stay on Earth forever.

01:18:37.755 --> 01:18:38.923
And some people don't.

01:18:39.924 --> 01:18:42.384
<i>Creating a self-sustained</i>
<i>civilization on Mars</i>

01:18:42.468 --> 01:18:44.929
<i>to provide insurance for life</i>
<i>as a whole,</i>

01:18:45.012 --> 01:18:48.349
a future where we are
a space-faring civilization

01:18:48.432 --> 01:18:50.768
and out there among the stars

01:18:50.851 --> 01:18:54.146
is infinitely more exciting and inspiring
than one where we are not.

01:18:58.067 --> 01:19:00.945
<i>The goal of SpaceX is really</i>
<i>to build the transport system.</i>

01:19:01.028 --> 01:19:03.364
<i>It's like building</i>
<i>the Union Pacific Railroad.</i>

01:19:10.829 --> 01:19:12.790
<i>What SpaceX is trying to do</i>

01:19:12.873 --> 01:19:18.212
<i>is to build the first reliable</i>
<i>interplanetary railroad.</i>

01:19:24.218 --> 01:19:26.929
<i>Using today's standard technologies,</i>

01:19:27.012 --> 01:19:31.475
<i>it would cost about $10 billion per person</i>
<i>to get to Mars and to live there.</i>

01:19:31.558 --> 01:19:35.396
That's pretty absurd. Not many people
on this planet that can afford that.

01:19:35.479 --> 01:19:38.857
And if we're going to build
a real civilization there

01:19:38.941 --> 01:19:41.068
where we have thousands,
if not millions, of people

01:19:41.151 --> 01:19:43.070
living, working and thriving on Mars,

01:19:43.737 --> 01:19:46.323
<i>we're gonna have to</i>
<i>get that cost down significantly.</i>

01:19:47.283 --> 01:19:48.867
<i> T minus one minute.</i>

01:19:51.078 --> 01:19:56.583
<i> The idea is the rocket takes off,</i>
<i>pings a spacecraft into space,</i>

01:19:56.667 --> 01:19:59.003
<i>either into low Earth orbit</i>
<i>or towards Mars.</i>

01:19:59.086 --> 01:20:02.006
<i>The rocket comes back</i>
<i>and lands vertically,</i>

01:20:02.089 --> 01:20:04.008
gets some maintenance, gets refueled.

01:20:04.091 --> 01:20:06.468
Boom! Pings another thing out into space.

01:20:06.552 --> 01:20:07.970
It can do this all day.

01:20:08.053 --> 01:20:10.431
It can send 15 things out in a day,
one rocket.

01:20:12.808 --> 01:20:14.059
<i> Liftoff!</i>

01:20:18.188 --> 01:20:21.525
<i>While the U.S. plans</i>
<i>to get human beings to Mars</i>

01:20:21.608 --> 01:20:23.527
<i>sometime vaguely in the 2030s,</i>

01:20:23.610 --> 01:20:26.113
he believes he can cut that time
by 10 years

01:20:26.196 --> 01:20:28.657
and get them there in the mid 2020s.

01:20:33.287 --> 01:20:35.748
<i>It never pays to rule out Elon Musk.</i>

01:20:35.831 --> 01:20:41.128
But, also, it never pays to get so seduced
by the Tony Stark side of Elon Musk

01:20:41.211 --> 01:20:43.047
that we think he can do anything.

01:20:43.130 --> 01:20:44.590
He's gonna come up against

01:20:44.673 --> 01:20:47.676
the same obstacles
every other rocketeer in history has.

01:20:58.562 --> 01:21:02.775
<i>Private industry is willing</i>
<i>to take risks that NASA isn't.</i>

01:21:02.858 --> 01:21:04.777
<i>This could be economically.</i>

01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:09.198
They could try to throw a lot of money
at something that might not work.

01:21:09.281 --> 01:21:13.827
But if it does work, boom.
You have something amazing.

01:21:16.372 --> 01:21:19.958
<i>The first stage is returning to land.</i>

01:21:20.042 --> 01:21:25.255
<i>The second stage powers</i>
<i>the Earth satellites into low Earth orbit.</i>

01:21:26.298 --> 01:21:27.966
<i>If rockets aren't reusable,</i>

01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:32.137
then humans don't go to Mars
this century or next century,

01:21:32.221 --> 01:21:34.014
<i>or maybe ever.</i>

01:21:36.725 --> 01:21:41.063
<i>That is the first stage.</i>
<i>Coming back down and landing!</i>

01:22:06.672 --> 01:22:10.926
I was just...not shocked, because I knew
we had what it would take to do this,

01:22:11.009 --> 01:22:13.303
we had come so close in the past.

01:22:13.387 --> 01:22:16.265
But feeling all of these things
that we've been talking about,

01:22:16.348 --> 01:22:19.768
<i>all this effort, blood, sweat, and tears</i>
<i>that went into this to succeed,</i>

01:22:19.852 --> 01:22:20.853
<i>it was now real.</i>

01:22:20.936 --> 01:22:22.312
<i>It was there in front of us.</i>

01:22:24.648 --> 01:22:28.694
Being a part of that unique moment
in history was just mind-blowing for me.

01:22:41.290 --> 01:22:44.960
<i>Elon's idea is not</i>
<i>to make the Mars thing happen by himself.</i>

01:22:45.043 --> 01:22:48.046
Elon is trying
to start this chain reaction,

01:22:48.130 --> 01:22:49.798
he's trying to
start a forest fire with a match.

01:22:49.882 --> 01:22:52.843
<i>By solving this one giant problem,</i>

01:22:52.926 --> 01:22:56.472
<i>the fact that you had to build</i>
<i>a new rocket for every launch in the past.</i>

01:22:56.555 --> 01:23:00.100
<i>By doing that, he thinks he can ignite</i>
<i>an entire new era of space travel</i>

01:23:00.184 --> 01:23:02.686
<i>where we become</i>
<i>a genuinely space-faring civilization.</i>

01:23:14.656 --> 01:23:19.203
<i>The vision of building</i>
<i>a civilization on Mars,</i>

01:23:19.286 --> 01:23:21.538
it's such a big, huge endeavor.

01:23:21.622 --> 01:23:24.249
It's not something
one single company can do alone.

01:23:24.333 --> 01:23:25.626
You need another perfect storm,

01:23:25.709 --> 01:23:30.506
you need some perfect storm of resources
and technology and the right people.

01:23:30.589 --> 01:23:35.010
And it's exciting
that I think maybe we have that.

01:23:37.888 --> 01:23:40.140
<i>What SpaceX is trying to do</i>
<i>is create a situation</i>

01:23:40.224 --> 01:23:43.352
<i>where all these industries and governments</i>
<i>suddenly start saying,</i>

01:23:43.435 --> 01:23:45.562
<i>"Well, now this is an option</i>
<i>we want to get in the game."</i>

01:23:45.646 --> 01:23:50.067
And suddenly, all this money
pours into rocket innovation,

01:23:50.150 --> 01:23:52.402
into Earth/Mars industries.

01:23:52.486 --> 01:23:57.491
Then that's what empowers the big push
to get a million people there eventually.

01:24:02.579 --> 01:24:05.040
<i> Now, you can only go to Mars</i>
<i>every 26 months.</i>

01:24:05.123 --> 01:24:07.668
<i>The orbits have to be oriented.</i>

01:24:07.751 --> 01:24:11.129
You can't just fly over the Sun.
We don't have enough rocket fuel for that.

01:24:13.882 --> 01:24:16.134
<i>Sometimes Mars</i>
<i>is really close to the Earth,</i>

01:24:16.218 --> 01:24:17.594
<i>sometimes it's really far,</i>

01:24:17.678 --> 01:24:20.138
<i>because planets orbit</i>
<i>in an elliptical path.</i>

01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:25.435
<i>And we'll stay on Mars for about</i>
<i>a year or two, depending on its orbit.</i>

01:24:25.519 --> 01:24:28.063
We have to wait for Mars
to come all the way back around

01:24:28.146 --> 01:24:30.107
to its closest point
for us to come back.

01:24:32.901 --> 01:24:34.611
<i> Once you're there,</i>

01:24:34.695 --> 01:24:37.948
<i>you have to be prepared</i>
<i>to stay for an extended period of time.</i>

01:24:38.031 --> 01:24:41.827
<i>And once you're prepared</i>
<i>to stay for an extended period of time,</i>

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:45.831
and the first handful of people,
four people, six people, eight people,

01:24:45.914 --> 01:24:49.418
learn to live off the land
to the extent that that can be done,

01:24:49.501 --> 01:24:53.589
<i>learn to make Mars their home</i>
<i>for more than a few days,</i>

01:24:53.672 --> 01:24:58.093
once you do that,
you've hammered your first piton

01:24:58.176 --> 01:25:01.221
in the great mountain
of colonizing another planet.

01:25:06.476 --> 01:25:11.106
If you establish first a cargo route
and then a human transportation route,

01:25:11.189 --> 01:25:14.026
<i>you have to imagine</i>
<i>that by a year like 2060,</i>

01:25:14.109 --> 01:25:17.779
<i>you have a thriving civilization on Mars.</i>

01:25:17.863 --> 01:25:19.865
<i>It's gonna be this normal part of life.</i>

01:25:20.991 --> 01:25:22.868
<i>There'll be people</i>
<i>going there for college,</i>

01:25:22.951 --> 01:25:24.870
<i>people are going to be</i>
<i>in long distance relationships.</i>

01:25:24.953 --> 01:25:27.623
There will be people born on Mars
who want to go to Earth for a stint

01:25:27.706 --> 01:25:32.044
to see the Eiffel Tower in the flesh,
to see the Sphinx in the flesh.

01:25:37.007 --> 01:25:42.596
<i>If we could have a Mars colony,</i>
<i>that would just be so cool,</i>

01:25:42.679 --> 01:25:48.518
to put footprints on Mars
and now we are having life living there.

01:25:48.602 --> 01:25:51.813
We can put people there.
We can have people live there.

01:25:51.897 --> 01:25:54.816
We could even terraform it
if we really tried.

01:25:57.569 --> 01:25:59.321
<i>What we're talking about eventually</i>

01:25:59.404 --> 01:26:03.200
<i>is a blue-green planet with maybe</i>
<i>7 billion of its own people on it.</i>

01:26:03.283 --> 01:26:05.535
And you could look at a picture
of a gorgeous green mountain

01:26:05.619 --> 01:26:07.537
and a lake and not know
what planet you're looking at.

01:26:11.416 --> 01:26:15.128
<i> It's a brand new planet,</i>
<i>who knows what future economies await us</i>

01:26:15.212 --> 01:26:16.922
<i>on that planetary surface?</i>

01:26:17.005 --> 01:26:20.592
Even if you can't think of one now,
it doesn't mean there isn't one.

01:26:20.676 --> 01:26:24.262
And especially given
the history of exploration and discovery,

01:26:24.346 --> 01:26:25.472
there probably will be.

01:26:27.265 --> 01:26:31.395
<i> When you go somewhere else</i>
<i>and live in a wild, rustic life,</i>

01:26:31.478 --> 01:26:34.439
<i>you've made the decision that</i>
<i>that kind of life,</i>

01:26:34.523 --> 01:26:35.941
the world you're building,

01:26:36.024 --> 01:26:39.027
is more valuable to you
than the world that's already built.

01:26:39.111 --> 01:26:45.117
<i>Your motivation is to live here,</i>
<i>to settle here, to die here.</i>

01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:47.327
<i>Because what you have in mind</i>

01:26:47.411 --> 01:26:51.039
<i>is three, five,</i>
<i>a hundred generations beyond you,</i>

01:26:51.123 --> 01:26:54.292
and you've made the decision
that you're going to be

01:26:54.376 --> 01:26:57.587
the first stake in the ground
of that new world.

01:27:01.091 --> 01:27:04.344
<i>Tell Orion that you're gonna start </i>
<i>their primary ingress checklist</i>

01:27:04.428 --> 01:27:07.180
<i>for Commander and Pilot</i>
<i>and DDP 1 and 2 and B 1 and 2.</i>

01:27:07.264 --> 01:27:10.684
All right, so...you first, Orion, on F1.

01:27:10.767 --> 01:27:13.103
Primary ingress checklist
for Pilot and Commander...

01:27:13.186 --> 01:27:17.441
All right, IDP CR22 power is on.

01:27:17.524 --> 01:27:20.318
Major functions set to DNC.

01:27:21.153 --> 01:27:25.198
We ordered that pizza 45 minutes ago.
It's been over 30 minutes. It's free now.

01:27:25.282 --> 01:27:27.951
No it's not.
They stopped doing that anyway.

01:27:28.034 --> 01:27:29.411
<i>I want my free pizza!</i>

01:27:30.579 --> 01:27:34.249
- All checklists are done.
- Yay! Ascent procedures.

01:27:34.332 --> 01:27:36.334
<i>Everyone switch</i>
<i>to ascent procedures.</i>

01:27:36.418 --> 01:27:41.339
Five, four, three, two, one...

01:27:42.758 --> 01:27:45.844
Oh my goodness! That is amazing.

01:27:53.727 --> 01:27:56.188
<i>One thing that's</i>
<i>impressed me the most, of anything else,</i>

01:27:56.271 --> 01:27:59.649
<i>is that kids today have that same drive,</i>

01:27:59.733 --> 01:28:03.403
<i>that same interest, that same passion</i>
<i>for space exploration</i>

01:28:03.487 --> 01:28:07.783
that I had as a young boy watching
the first American launch into space.

01:28:09.618 --> 01:28:12.162
- That's a lot of retro.
- All right, listen up Orion.

01:28:12.245 --> 01:28:15.999
Now we're done with launch so
start focusing on our checklist again.

01:28:16.082 --> 01:28:18.794
Our engines are turned off.
We are good to unbuckle.

01:28:20.545 --> 01:28:23.298
I'm floating around
in the most peculiar way.

01:28:24.049 --> 01:28:27.344
Early this morning, the Space Launch
System launched from Cape Canaveral,

01:28:27.427 --> 01:28:30.931
<i>carrying along with it the Orion capsule</i>
<i>and six brave Americans</i>

01:28:31.014 --> 01:28:33.850
on their way to go boldly
where no man has ever gone before.

01:28:33.934 --> 01:28:35.310
Let's do this!

01:28:36.186 --> 01:28:38.897
<i>Exploration is absolutely</i>
<i>embedded in our DNA.</i>

01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:42.651
<i>If we are on this hill,</i>
<i>we want to know what's on the next hill.</i>

01:28:42.734 --> 01:28:45.237
<i>We cannot help ourselves.</i>

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:50.200
There's no reason for us
not to surrender to that impulse.

01:28:54.788 --> 01:28:59.084
<i>The first steps on Mars</i>
<i>won't just be a national moment of pride,</i>

01:28:59.167 --> 01:29:02.254
<i>but really a worldwide moment of pride,</i>

01:29:02.337 --> 01:29:06.967
and ultimately, I think, kicks off this
sense of exploration on the right foot,

01:29:07.050 --> 01:29:09.761
of one that is
as an entirely global experience.

01:29:12.556 --> 01:29:14.140
<i> I have good evidence</i>

01:29:14.224 --> 01:29:16.226
<i>that space matters</i>
<i>to the hearts and minds of people.</i>

01:29:16.309 --> 01:29:19.771
There's something special,
I think, about the night sky

01:29:19.855 --> 01:29:21.147
and about the universe

01:29:21.231 --> 01:29:22.607
that lives within us.

01:29:24.401 --> 01:29:27.153
<i>There are two questions</i>
<i>that get everybody.</i>

01:29:27.821 --> 01:29:30.949
<i>The first one is: where did we come from?</i>

01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:34.286
<i>Where did we all come from?</i>
<i>How did we get here?</i>

01:29:36.204 --> 01:29:39.374
<i>And the other question is:</i>
<i>are we alone in the universe?</i>

01:29:40.250 --> 01:29:42.252
<i>If we were to discover evidence of life,</i>

01:29:42.335 --> 01:29:45.380
or stranger still,
something alive on Mars today,

01:29:45.463 --> 01:29:47.716
it would change
the course of human history

01:29:47.799 --> 01:29:50.885
<i>in the same way astronomy</i>
<i>has humbled us in the past.</i>

01:29:51.303 --> 01:29:52.637
<i>The Earth is not flat.</i>

01:29:52.721 --> 01:29:55.599
<i>We are not the center of it.</i>
<i>The Sun's the center of it.</i>

01:29:55.682 --> 01:29:57.392
<i>Wait! The Sun's not the center of it.</i>

01:29:57.475 --> 01:30:01.146
<i>We're just one more sun</i>
<i>in this galactic disc.</i>

01:30:01.229 --> 01:30:04.107
<i>And we're not the only galaxy!</i>
<i>We're not by any means!</i>

01:30:04.190 --> 01:30:07.986
<i>We're just these specks on a speck</i>
<i>orbiting specks in specklessness.</i>

01:30:08.069 --> 01:30:09.195
<i>We're nothing.</i>

01:30:11.406 --> 01:30:14.492
Yet, we can understand that.

01:30:21.124 --> 01:30:23.376
<i> Humans have lived</i>
<i>a thousand centuries so far.</i>

01:30:24.586 --> 01:30:28.840
This century is the first time
where suddenly going to Mars is an option.

01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:37.349
<i>I think it's awesome that</i>
<i>we have an entire generation of people</i>

01:30:37.432 --> 01:30:39.684
<i>who want to go to into space,</i>
<i>who want to go Mars,</i>

01:30:39.768 --> 01:30:41.144
<i>who want to be STEM fluent.</i>

01:30:41.227 --> 01:30:47.359
But I can tell you that all of that
will fall on fallow soil,

01:30:48.652 --> 01:30:51.112
<i>if there isn't some big mission</i>

01:30:51.196 --> 01:30:54.824
<i>on the other side</i>
<i>of that educational pipeline</i>

01:30:54.908 --> 01:30:57.619
<i>where they can apply</i>
<i>this energy and this enthusiasm.</i>

01:31:00.705 --> 01:31:03.625
<i>It's our duty</i>
<i>to breathe life and fire</i>

01:31:03.708 --> 01:31:06.252
<i>into the imagination of these young people</i>

01:31:06.336 --> 01:31:09.631
<i>so they will say,</i>
<i>"Yes! I want to become an astronaut!</i>

01:31:09.714 --> 01:31:11.216
<i>I want to explore outer space!"</i>

01:31:11.299 --> 01:31:15.136
Because our true place is among the stars.

01:31:18.890 --> 01:31:20.183
Oh wow, we're landing.

01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:24.396
We're landing. Guys, we're landing.

01:31:24.479 --> 01:31:26.815
We are frickin' landing on Mars right now.

01:31:26.898 --> 01:31:28.817
Dude, dude, dude.
We just landed.

01:31:30.235 --> 01:31:31.194
We're on Mars.

01:31:36.491 --> 01:31:39.703
<i>I hope that my generation</i>
<i>will be defined by Mars.</i>

01:31:39.786 --> 01:31:43.707
I can't think of a better thing
to be defined by!

01:31:47.669 --> 01:31:51.631
<i>Somebody from my generation</i>
<i>will step out of the lander</i>

01:31:51.715 --> 01:31:55.135
<i>and put their footprint down</i>
<i>in the Martian soil.</i>

01:31:55.218 --> 01:32:01.391
If I could contribute to that in any way,
it would be an amazing experience.

01:32:07.814 --> 01:32:09.858
<i>This date</i>
<i>will go down in history.</i>

01:32:09.941 --> 01:32:12.694
<i>After a long 183-day journey,</i>

01:32:12.777 --> 01:32:15.947
<i>six Americans have finally exited</i>
<i>the all-terra lander</i>

01:32:16.030 --> 01:32:18.116
and put their boots
in the red Martian soil.

01:32:21.536 --> 01:32:24.205
The Mars Generation is...us.

01:32:31.921 --> 01:32:35.508
<i> Exploration is</i>
<i>ingrained within our DNA.</i>

01:32:38.595 --> 01:32:43.183
Human beings,
they want to learn about the cosmos.

01:32:47.353 --> 01:32:48.813
<i>We know so little about space.</i>

01:32:48.897 --> 01:32:51.941
<i>There's so much to do</i>
<i>and so much to learn.</i>

01:32:52.025 --> 01:32:53.067
And I want to do it all.

01:32:56.696 --> 01:32:59.491
<i>Like, can you imagine</i>
<i>if there was just nothing else?</i>

01:32:59.574 --> 01:33:02.035
<i>That we had found</i>
<i>everything there is to find?</i>

01:33:02.911 --> 01:33:04.412
Life would be so boring!

01:33:10.293 --> 01:33:11.878
Let's go. Let's go to Mars.

01:33:17.634 --> 01:33:18.843
<i> It's been long enough.</i>

01:33:18.927 --> 01:33:21.179
<i>We need to go for it, full speed.</i>

01:33:21.262 --> 01:33:24.599
<i>Because humans need to</i>
<i>do significant things,</i>

01:33:24.682 --> 01:33:26.559
<i>because that's just how humanity is.</i>

01:33:27.268 --> 01:33:29.604
We gotta get off this planet
and we gotta land on Mars.
