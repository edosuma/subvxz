so full of himself.

10:18.619 --> 10:22.495
Hmm. Was there something
going on between you
and Julian?

10:23.957 --> 10:26.124
I haven't seen him
since graduation.

10:27.085 --> 10:29.628
Well, I don't know why
you both are being
so stubborn.

10:29.704 --> 10:33.798
Hello! It's a chance
to win $50,000.

10:34.176 --> 10:35.950
Shoot.

10:35.952 --> 10:37.636
Makes me wish I didn't
have to cover the show
for the station

10:37.638 --> 10:39.888
or I'd try to win
my damn self.

10:39.890 --> 10:42.891
-[Cheryl] Hmm,
just one problem, babe.
-What?

10:42.893 --> 10:44.934
The only thing you cook
is a pop tart.

10:44.936 --> 10:46.311
-Oh.
-[Layne laughs]

10:46.313 --> 10:48.605
-Touche.
-Struggling to boil water.

10:48.607 --> 10:49.731
[indistinct]

10:51.902 --> 10:54.444
So where's your
Christmas list?

10:54.446 --> 10:57.614
Mom, do you still think
I'm writing a Christmas list
to Santa?

10:57.658 --> 10:59.491
No, I don't.

10:59.567 --> 11:01.701
But I do believe you want
something going under
that Christmas tree.

11:01.703 --> 11:04.162
Sure, but I don't want
anything you can buy
at a store.

11:04.239 --> 11:05.538
What do you want?

11:05.540 --> 11:07.624
An acceptance letter
to Fallbrook.

11:07.626 --> 11:09.167
Maybe I'll get a scholarship.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.169
They would be lucky
to have you.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.504
And if you get accepted,

11:13.173 --> 11:15.048
then we'll just
have to figure it out.

11:15.050 --> 11:19.052
The only other thing I want
is to see Dad.

11:19.054 --> 11:21.054
Do you think he'll come
to Philly for Christmas?

11:22.432 --> 11:24.724
I sure do hope so, sunshine.

11:25.394 --> 11:26.935
Get yourself ready.

11:27.604 --> 11:29.396
Don't forget
to check your levels.

11:40.575 --> 11:42.742
[keypad beeping]

11:43.328 --> 11:45.328
[line rings]

11:45.372 --> 11:46.830
Damon, it's Bri.

11:46.832 --> 11:48.790
I've been trying to call you.

11:48.792 --> 11:50.250
It's about Willow.

11:50.326 --> 11:52.001
Call me back, please.

11:55.549 --> 11:56.631
[cellphone pinging]

12:39.634 --> 12:42.093
[cellphone ringing]

12:42.095 --> 12:44.721
-Hello.
-[Cricket] <i> Hi, is this</i>
<i> Julian Broussard?</i>

12:44.765 --> 12:47.265
-Yes.
-This is Cricket Paige
from <i> All-Starr Bake Wars.</i>

12:47.267 --> 12:50.018
We want to invite you
to audition for the show
this afternoon.

12:50.020 --> 12:52.312
Could you bring a dessert
for Felix Starr to sample?

12:52.314 --> 12:54.147
<i> What? Yes.</i>

12:54.149 --> 12:55.857
-Absolutely.
<i> -Great. See you then.</i>

12:55.859 --> 12:57.317
Okay, I'm there.

12:59.029 --> 12:59.986
Ooh!

12:59.988 --> 13:01.112
[wondering] Ooh.

13:01.189 --> 13:03.198
[worrying] Ooh. Sophie.

13:03.200 --> 13:06.159
You'll need these
for my fans this afternoon.

13:06.161 --> 13:08.828
You know, they'll be
lined up in droves
for this competition.

13:10.499 --> 13:12.040
Well, speaking of headshots.

13:12.918 --> 13:15.502
I've got Julian Broussard
coming to the audition.

13:16.588 --> 13:18.755
-Hey, Ma, I just got
this great phone call--
-Julian.

13:18.757 --> 13:21.299
I wasn't able to knead
the dough this morning,
so you'll have to.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.134
-You didn't make the dough?
-No.

13:23.136 --> 13:26.721
-Get a move on,
we open in an hour.
-All right.

13:26.798 --> 13:28.381
But you always make the dough.

13:28.383 --> 13:30.725
He works with her at their
family bakery
in Chestnut Hill.

13:30.727 --> 13:31.935
She passed my call.

13:31.937 --> 13:33.603
Super rude, by the way.

13:33.605 --> 13:35.480
But last night,
her son applied.

13:35.482 --> 13:36.856
You know Sophie.

13:37.192 --> 13:38.942
Everyone knows Sophie.

13:40.278 --> 13:43.071
When I was first starting out,
she judged my quiche Lorraine

13:43.073 --> 13:44.656
at the Bay Area Food Festival.

13:44.732 --> 13:46.825
Called it pedestrian.

13:46.827 --> 13:49.619
Like something
from the freezer section
of the supermarket.

13:56.545 --> 14:00.338
This is Layne Perkins,
reporting from
the Dessert Network Studios,

14:00.340 --> 14:05.218
where Felix Starr,
host of the popular television
show <i> All-Starr Bake Wars,</i>

14:05.295 --> 14:09.430
is auditioning potential
contestants for his
upcoming holiday competition.

14:12.227 --> 14:13.434
Hmm.

14:14.729 --> 14:15.937
Tastes like a pharmacy.

14:17.691 --> 14:19.858
I'm just going to...

14:20.694 --> 14:23.236
Well, doesn't this look nice?

14:23.238 --> 14:24.946
Let's just get a...

14:26.116 --> 14:29.534
Hmm, me like me like,
thank you.

14:32.455 --> 14:34.372
So where's Brianna Davison?

14:34.374 --> 14:37.584
I don't know, boss.
I confirmed the time
with her yesterday.

14:37.586 --> 14:39.294
-[footsteps approaching]
-[Felix] Then I guess
she's eliminated.

14:39.370 --> 14:40.920
I'm Brianna Davison.

14:40.922 --> 14:42.380
I'm sorry.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.548
But you're too late.

14:43.550 --> 14:46.259
What? No, no, no, no.

14:46.261 --> 14:47.552
Come on.

14:47.804 --> 14:48.928
[sighs]

14:52.309 --> 14:54.225
Mom, what are you doing?

14:54.728 --> 14:55.935
Hmm.

14:57.355 --> 14:58.730
You can do this.

15:05.196 --> 15:07.947
Felix, listen,
my truck broke down.

15:12.495 --> 15:14.037
Oh!

15:14.956 --> 15:16.831
[all exclaiming]

15:17.918 --> 15:19.208
[gasps]

15:20.462 --> 15:22.045
You got to be kidding me.

15:22.380 --> 15:23.630
My cake.

15:23.632 --> 15:25.048
My tart.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.885
-Brianna Davison?
-Julian Broussard.

15:28.887 --> 15:30.595
What are you doing here?
You ruined my tart.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.014
"Ruined?"

15:33.091 --> 15:35.850
-French tart. Predictable.
-French fruit tart.

15:35.852 --> 15:39.771
Okay, well, given your
pastry school skills,
I probably helped.

15:39.847 --> 15:42.982
Well, I'm sure you're vegan,
no butter, no eggs,

15:43.059 --> 15:46.277
no taste dry cake wouldn't
have impressed anybody today.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.780
Well, I guess they let anybody
in this competition, huh?

15:48.782 --> 15:52.116
Well, obviously not.
From what I just heard,
you're not in it.

15:52.193 --> 15:55.828
And from what I remember,
when the heat was turned up
in the kitchen,

15:56.498 --> 15:58.456
you didn't stick around.

15:58.491 --> 16:00.583
You two know each other?

16:00.585 --> 16:02.543
-Yeah, kind of.
-A little.

16:02.578 --> 16:03.920
I mean, kind of, just...

16:03.922 --> 16:05.838
Went to pastry school.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.507
So you're school rivals.

16:07.509 --> 16:09.175
When's the last time
you saw each other?

16:09.177 --> 16:11.386
-I haven't seen him since--
-Graduation.

16:11.462 --> 16:14.180
-Since I graduated
first in class.
-What?

16:14.182 --> 16:15.807
At graduation.

16:15.809 --> 16:19.519
Well, you'll have
plenty of spare time
to get reacquainted

16:19.521 --> 16:21.437
since you're
both disqualified.

16:21.439 --> 16:22.480
-Both?
-What?

16:22.482 --> 16:23.481
Both?

16:23.558 --> 16:24.899
You can't disqualify me.

16:24.901 --> 16:27.735
I'm sorry,
but you're both out.

16:28.613 --> 16:31.239
[indistinct conversation]

16:33.994 --> 16:36.411
[inaudible]

16:41.042 --> 16:42.125
[Willow] Let them bake.

16:42.127 --> 16:43.835
[all] Let them bake.

16:43.837 --> 16:45.503
Let them bake.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.005
Let them bake.

16:47.081 --> 16:48.756
Let them bake.

16:48.758 --> 16:50.550
-Let them bake.
-Felix, she messed up my tart.

16:50.626 --> 16:52.510
I didn't do anything wrong.
You can't do that.

16:52.587 --> 16:53.928
I can do anything I want.

16:54.556 --> 16:56.931
I'm Felix Starr, it's my show.

16:56.933 --> 16:57.724
Um, boss.

16:57.726 --> 16:59.350
This is no surprise.

16:59.427 --> 17:02.562
Bad blood between these two
could make
for good television.

17:03.106 --> 17:04.564
You are absolutely right.

17:04.640 --> 17:06.024
-I am not looking--
-Look at my dessert.

17:06.026 --> 17:07.567
-It was a complete accident.
-[Cricket] There you go.

17:07.643 --> 17:09.360
Yeah, you always
had two left feet.

17:09.696 --> 17:11.195
Two desserts.

17:11.272 --> 17:13.531
Please, take your places.

17:18.371 --> 17:21.080
So what did you make, Brianna?

17:21.157 --> 17:23.624
A vegan strawberry Shortcake.

17:23.626 --> 17:26.044
Tch, something dry.

17:29.591 --> 17:32.091
What did you make,
Julian Broussard?

17:32.093 --> 17:34.802
I made a classic
French fruit tart.

17:39.684 --> 17:42.018
Kandi Kakes,
what did you prepare?

17:42.020 --> 17:45.354
I made a pecan pie
with fresh whipped cream.

17:46.232 --> 17:48.107
Cannot believe
you messed up my tart.

17:48.109 --> 17:50.193
I can't believe you had
the nerve to enter that tart.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.904
I did you a favor.
Thank me later.

17:52.906 --> 17:57.283
[scoffs] Doing me a favor
would mean not even
entering this competition.

17:57.360 --> 18:00.286
Well, I've sampled
all the desserts.

18:00.288 --> 18:02.038
Thank you
for your submissions.

18:02.540 --> 18:03.956
You're all dismissed.

18:05.126 --> 18:08.086
Now that Felix Starr
sampled the entries,

18:08.088 --> 18:12.548
the final eight contestants
will be posted online
tomorrow morning.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.430
You still got a shot, Mom.

18:19.432 --> 18:22.391
I don't... I...
Let's just go home.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.452
Willow, honey.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.037
Look, I probably
didn't make it

18:43.039 --> 18:45.414
so you don't have to keep
checking the show's website.

18:45.416 --> 18:46.707
Got to have faith, Mom.

18:46.784 --> 18:48.459
Isn't that what you're
always telling me?

18:48.461 --> 18:50.753
Oh, so now you
want to listen to me?

18:51.214 --> 18:53.189
Mom, look.

18:53.191 --> 18:56.384
Hey, everybody, my mom's
going to be in Felix Starr's
new dessert show.

18:56.386 --> 18:58.386
[all cheering]

18:58.462 --> 19:01.222
[Willow] Oh, my God.
You actually got it.

19:01.299 --> 19:04.183
Oh, my God. What?

19:04.185 --> 19:08.354
There's you, Kandi Kakes
and Julian Broussard.

19:08.356 --> 19:09.814
[dismissively] Hmm.

19:14.237 --> 19:15.528
Why are you sweating, Julian?

19:15.989 --> 19:17.405
I'm not.

19:17.481 --> 19:19.699
I'm okay, I just...

19:20.785 --> 19:23.452
Show Julian who the better
baker is once and for all.

19:24.289 --> 19:26.389
Why are you so smart?

19:26.391 --> 19:29.834
Well, I read that children
can inherit their intelligence
from their mothers.

19:29.911 --> 19:32.044
Oh, well, at least
I did something right.

19:32.121 --> 19:34.079
But scientists also believe

19:34.081 --> 19:37.800
there's a cluster of genes
in the brain that determine
human intelligence.

19:39.971 --> 19:41.262
So I get no credit.

19:41.339 --> 19:42.847
Got it.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.724
I think you did the best
you could.

19:44.842 --> 19:45.808
[Brianna laughs]

19:45.852 --> 19:47.393
[Julian] It's not ridiculous.

19:47.395 --> 19:49.228
It's an amazing opportunity.

19:49.230 --> 19:51.272
And it's great promotion
for the bakery.

19:51.349 --> 19:53.524
What about your work
at the bakery?

19:53.601 --> 19:55.276
We'll be done
by Christmas Eve.

19:55.353 --> 19:57.069
It only takes three weeks.

19:57.071 --> 19:59.104
I promise you
it will not interfere.

19:59.181 --> 20:05.036
Julian, the Broussard name
is associated with the finest
in French pastries.

20:05.038 --> 20:08.080
It's not some silly
cookie decorating contest.

20:08.157 --> 20:12.210
I've learned from the best
and that's you.

20:12.212 --> 20:15.755
Now it's time for me
to take all that
classic French training

20:15.757 --> 20:19.550
and put my twist on it
and show it to the world.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.844
Look, I've made
some great desserts

20:21.846 --> 20:24.639
and I've tested them out
with some of the customers

20:24.715 --> 20:27.725
and let me tell you something,
they like them.

20:37.153 --> 20:38.027
See?

20:38.780 --> 20:40.029
See?

20:41.074 --> 20:42.698
-Julian.
-Yes.

20:42.700 --> 20:44.825
I know how talented you are.

20:46.371 --> 20:50.581
But these desserts aren't
keeping with the classic
French techniques

20:50.583 --> 20:53.668
our customers have come
to expect at this bakery.

20:53.744 --> 20:57.505
Mom, it's time to build,
expand our legacy.

20:58.591 --> 21:01.050
People like this.

21:01.094 --> 21:04.178
Son, it's all right if you
want to join this competition,

21:04.180 --> 21:07.932
but we need to go with
what we know works.

21:35.712 --> 21:38.296
-Ah.
-I love the star.

21:38.298 --> 21:42.174
But we can skip some of
Grandma Sadie's
other holiday traditions.

21:42.176 --> 21:43.676
Now, wait a minute.

21:43.678 --> 21:45.803
I thought you love Christmas
in New Orleans,

21:45.805 --> 21:49.056
with parades and your favorite
holiday king cake,

21:49.058 --> 21:51.100
and a Reveillon dinner
on Christmas Eve?

21:51.144 --> 21:52.977
I do, Mom,

21:52.979 --> 21:55.938
but it's a hard pass for me
on that chicken
and oyster gumbo pie.

21:55.973 --> 21:58.107
Now that's
a New Orleans tradition.

21:58.109 --> 22:01.861
Your Grandma Sadie
would roll over in her grave
if she heard you say that.

22:01.937 --> 22:05.323
Um, I was thinking,
since we're not going
to Nola this year,

22:05.325 --> 22:08.868
maybe we can go
with smoked turkey
or a glazed ham instead.

22:08.870 --> 22:12.038
Oh, despite your blasphemy
against her beloved chicken,

22:12.040 --> 22:13.164
I have

22:14.250 --> 22:15.499
a surprise for you.

22:16.711 --> 22:19.587
[hums] Bam!

22:19.589 --> 22:20.629
What's this?

22:20.631 --> 22:22.256
I don't know. Open it.

22:26.471 --> 22:28.637
Oh, my gosh.
Mom, I got in!

22:28.723 --> 22:30.181
Yes!

22:30.183 --> 22:32.308
Of course, you did,
my brilliant baby.

22:32.310 --> 22:34.477
They would have been foolish
not to accept you.

22:34.479 --> 22:38.022
-[door closes]
-Hey, hey, hey,
what's all the excitement?

22:38.775 --> 22:40.024
I got into Fallbrook.

22:40.026 --> 22:41.525
Yes!

22:41.602 --> 22:43.527
[cheering]

22:43.529 --> 22:44.862
[Layne] Oh, my goodness.

22:44.864 --> 22:46.072
[Willow] Ooh,
I got to call Maya.

22:46.148 --> 22:47.948
-[Brianna] Mmm-hmm.
-[Layne laughs]

22:47.950 --> 22:50.493
Now we have
two things to celebrate:

22:50.536 --> 22:52.453
-Willow's acceptance.
-Mmm-hmm.

22:52.455 --> 22:53.996
And...

22:55.541 --> 22:57.416
<i> -Bake Wars.</i>
-Ah.

22:57.418 --> 22:58.459
[laughs]

22:58.461 --> 23:00.503
Yeah, yeah.

23:00.505 --> 23:05.132
Ooh, but did you see
that tuition into Fallbrook?

23:10.014 --> 23:12.556
-That's the number
for one year?
-Uh-huh.

23:12.558 --> 23:14.466
Oof, you have to sell
hella desserts

23:14.468 --> 23:17.853
and several vital organs
on the dark web
to come up with that number.

23:17.855 --> 23:20.606
Yes, and they want the deposit
by the end of the month.

23:20.608 --> 23:23.109
It will break Willow's heart
if she can't go to school

23:23.111 --> 23:24.568
with the rest
of the baby brainiacs.

23:24.645 --> 23:26.404
[Layne] Hmm.

23:26.480 --> 23:30.282
Well, I hate to bring up
he who is forever
and always dead to us,

23:30.359 --> 23:32.701
but have you heard from Damon?

23:32.703 --> 23:33.953
Still nothing.

23:33.955 --> 23:36.080
And I am mad.

23:36.157 --> 23:38.499
Willow has worked so hard
to get into Fallbrook,

23:38.501 --> 23:42.586
and now I got to find some way
to pay for it by myself.

23:42.588 --> 23:44.755
Hopefully, you hear
from him soon.

23:45.299 --> 23:47.466
But I have faith in you.

23:47.543 --> 23:50.636
Well, schools don't take
faith over checks.

23:50.638 --> 23:51.720
Don't turn this
into a pity party.

23:51.722 --> 23:53.639
No, ma'am.

23:53.641 --> 23:56.851
We're going to celebrate
all the good news
you got today.

23:56.927 --> 23:59.437
Making the cut on <i> Bake Wars</i>

23:59.513 --> 24:01.021
and Willow's acceptance.

24:01.441 --> 24:03.607
-Cheers, sis.
-Cheers.

24:04.277 --> 24:05.776
But it's still a lot of money.

24:05.778 --> 24:07.862
You guys find a place
for the engagement party?

24:07.938 --> 24:10.614
Hmm, Julian offered
to host at his place.

24:10.992 --> 24:12.032
[Brianna] Hmm.

24:18.708 --> 24:19.773
[exhales loudly]

24:19.850 --> 24:23.419
What is your problem
with Julian?

24:23.421 --> 24:26.881
Every time I mention
my cousin's name
for the last two years,

24:26.957 --> 24:29.717
you act like I'm related
to your high school bully.

24:29.886 --> 24:31.469
What's the deal?

24:34.849 --> 24:38.267
[sighs] Julian and I had
a one night stand
two years ago.

24:38.269 --> 24:40.936
-Stop! I can't believe this!
-Shh. Shh.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.480
-Be quiet,
Willow will hear you.
-Girl, I--

24:42.556 --> 24:44.389
Shh.

24:45.401 --> 24:49.236
I just can't believe
you did the horizontal hook-up
with my cousin.

24:49.238 --> 24:51.238
You never told me.

24:51.240 --> 24:54.033
You ain't even right for that.

24:54.035 --> 24:57.203
Well, it wasn't exactly
the horizontal,
it was more like the vertical.

24:57.321 --> 24:58.662
Girl!

25:00.333 --> 25:01.874
Ooh, you need to spill now,
all the deets.

25:01.876 --> 25:04.793
[moping] Well,
it was a disaster.

25:05.296 --> 25:07.213
That's why I didn't tell you.

25:07.215 --> 25:08.580
We never spoke about it again,

25:08.582 --> 25:10.841
and we've been avoiding
each other around town.

25:10.843 --> 25:13.469
[chuckling] That must have
been some night.

25:13.513 --> 25:15.262
It was the night
before graduation.

25:15.264 --> 25:17.072
Keep talking.

25:17.074 --> 25:21.644
And first of all,
I had no intentions
on hooking up with Julian.

25:21.687 --> 25:24.063
Now, don't get me wrong,
the chemistry was there
from the jump,

25:24.065 --> 25:26.857
but we were so busy
being competitive

25:26.859 --> 25:30.027
and shooting for top
of the class
that nothing happened until...

25:31.572 --> 25:36.367
This one night, we both drew
the short straws for clean up
after class dinner.

25:36.369 --> 25:38.118
Juicy.

25:40.248 --> 25:44.792
Well, after the cleanup,
Julian felt like we deserved
a dessert,

25:44.794 --> 25:46.126
so he made creme brulee.

25:46.128 --> 25:48.671
[snorts] Damn, girl!

25:48.673 --> 25:51.382
You fell for the pastry play
in the Himalayas line.

25:51.384 --> 25:54.426
[in deep voice] "Let me
make you some
creme brulee." [laughs]

25:56.013 --> 25:58.222
You want to hear
the rest of the story or not?

26:00.059 --> 26:01.100
Hey.

26:01.176 --> 26:02.351
[laughing]

26:02.979 --> 26:04.853
-Oh, almost forgot.
-What?

26:04.897 --> 26:06.855
Oh. Mmm-hmm.

26:06.857 --> 26:09.900
The best part of the night?
The creme brulee.

26:09.902 --> 26:11.402
[Brianna] Aha.

26:11.404 --> 26:14.446
[speaking in French]

26:14.448 --> 26:17.157
Who can resist a man
that speaks French?

26:17.159 --> 26:18.200
Not you.

26:18.202 --> 26:20.035
[both laugh]

26:21.414 --> 26:23.455
-Hmm.
-Mmm.

26:23.457 --> 26:25.374
You smell so good.

26:25.376 --> 26:26.542
Thank you.

26:27.503 --> 26:29.295
[chuckles]

26:43.936 --> 26:47.104
He always gets the girls
with the French.

26:47.106 --> 26:49.356
I know.
He was sounding so good.

26:49.358 --> 26:50.666
He could have been
counting backwards

26:50.668 --> 26:51.942
and I wouldn't have
known the difference.

26:52.737 --> 26:55.946
So y'all did it
in the kitchen?

26:56.023 --> 26:57.172
You going to keep
asking questions,

26:57.174 --> 26:58.616
you going to let me
finish the story?

26:59.410 --> 27:00.993
We should do that more often.

27:01.070 --> 27:03.037
-Yes, we should.
-Yes, we should.

27:03.039 --> 27:05.039
[both laugh]

27:07.793 --> 27:09.293
[Julian] Man, that was great.

27:09.295 --> 27:11.337
-Yes, it was.
-Mmm-hmm.

27:11.339 --> 27:13.631
You handled that... Fire.

27:13.633 --> 27:15.215
-Huh, I know I was.
-No, no, no.

27:15.292 --> 27:17.009
-No, fire, no, fire.
-Oh, oh.

27:17.011 --> 27:18.927
Oh, you left the torch on.

27:18.929 --> 27:20.512
You distracted me.

27:20.514 --> 27:21.663
I can't help it--

27:21.665 --> 27:22.723
-[fire alarm blaring]
-Oh, my God.

27:22.800 --> 27:24.933
[groans] Oh, no.

27:25.519 --> 27:26.977
Oh, no.

27:28.189 --> 27:29.813
You better call
the fire department.

27:31.609 --> 27:33.901
[laughs]

27:34.862 --> 27:36.487
Well, I'm glad to know
you find humor

27:36.489 --> 27:40.324
in the dumpster fire
that is the worst
hook-up of my life.

27:41.744 --> 27:43.452
Then what happened?

27:44.914 --> 27:46.497
I was mortified.

27:47.750 --> 27:51.293
And the next morning,
when the class rankings
came out,

27:51.962 --> 27:55.005
he was number one
and I told him

27:55.007 --> 27:57.883
that the only reason he won
was because his last name
was Broussard.

27:57.960 --> 27:59.760
[softly] Ouch.

27:59.837 --> 28:01.762
That must have cut
Julian deep.

28:01.764 --> 28:05.140
Yeah, we had
a big fight about it
and we never spoke again.

28:05.893 --> 28:06.892
Hmm.

28:06.894 --> 28:09.186
-[cellphone beeps]
-Mmm.

28:10.606 --> 28:15.734
Oh, look, it's the first promo
for <i> All-Starr Bake Wars,</i>
just dropped on social media.

28:15.736 --> 28:18.278
<i> Tarts, pies,</i>
<i> cookies and cakes.</i>

28:18.355 --> 28:19.846
Oh, my.

28:19.848 --> 28:22.741
Welcome to the <i> All-Starr</i>
<i> Christmas Bake War,</i>

28:22.743 --> 28:24.451
where it's baker versus baker

28:24.453 --> 28:26.495
in a frosted fight
to the finish.

28:28.290 --> 28:29.832
<i> Each contestant to face off</i>

28:29.834 --> 28:32.376
<i> -in our Christmas</i>
<i> baking battle.</i>
-Okay.

28:32.378 --> 28:35.421
-From a classically trained
French pastry chef.
-You ruined my tart.

28:35.423 --> 28:37.423
To a feisty food truck maven.

28:37.425 --> 28:39.174
I can't believe you
entered that tart.

28:39.176 --> 28:40.175
Thank me later.

28:40.177 --> 28:41.760
And a social media star.

28:41.762 --> 28:43.429
As I've made this so...

28:43.431 --> 28:48.892
The flour will fly
in the fight to win $50,000.

28:48.894 --> 28:50.227
[Brianna] What?

28:51.647 --> 28:55.524
What have I gotten
myself into? [groans]

28:55.568 --> 28:56.692
Well.

28:57.361 --> 28:59.236
May the best baker win,

28:59.238 --> 29:02.656
and you let me know when
you need the fire department
on standby.

29:02.950 --> 29:04.390
Get out.

29:04.468 --> 29:06.744
-[sniffs] Smells
kind of smoky--
-Right now.

29:06.746 --> 29:09.288
Philadelphia is buzzing
with pride

29:09.290 --> 29:10.789
since the City
of Brotherly Love

29:10.866 --> 29:15.127
was chosen as the site
for an epic baking battle.

29:15.204 --> 29:20.174
Now let's meet the man
behind the holiday magic,
Dessert Network's Felix Starr.

29:20.176 --> 29:21.842
[Felix] Thank you, Layne.
Happy to be here.

29:21.844 --> 29:23.552
Hi.

29:23.554 --> 29:25.971
Would you mind helping me
with my apron, please?

29:26.048 --> 29:27.848
Uh, sure.

29:29.977 --> 29:31.310
So hard sometimes.

29:31.386 --> 29:33.020
-I know.
These things are tricky.
-[giggles]

29:33.022 --> 29:34.188
You're good with your hands.

29:34.190 --> 29:36.607
Uh, yeah, hope so.

29:37.735 --> 29:39.109
-Uh, okay.
-Thank you.

29:39.111 --> 29:40.360
All right.

29:43.491 --> 29:44.782
What is up, y'all?

29:44.784 --> 29:47.326
It's your girl Kandi Kakes
coming to you live

29:47.328 --> 29:49.745
from the <i> All-Starr</i>
<i> Bake War</i>  competition.

29:49.747 --> 29:53.624
Now make sure y'all tune in
and watch your girl win.

29:54.168 --> 29:55.334
Smooches.

29:56.295 --> 29:57.878
You have a lot of followers?

29:57.880 --> 29:59.037
[Kandi] Yes, sir.

29:59.039 --> 30:01.089
Contestants, for your
first challenge,

30:01.091 --> 30:05.302
you'll be tasked with making
the ultimate holiday
cookie decoration

30:05.379 --> 30:08.388
for the Christmas tree
at your workstation.

30:08.390 --> 30:11.099
Let the baking battle begin.

30:11.101 --> 30:12.726
Cricket, start the clock.

30:24.573 --> 30:25.656
-Julian.
-Yeah?

30:25.658 --> 30:27.199
-Give me some sugar.
-What?

30:27.234 --> 30:29.051
Give me some of your sugar.

30:29.053 --> 30:30.953
[Julian] I don't think we're
supposed to be
sharing ingredients.

30:30.955 --> 30:32.237
[Brianna] They obviously
left my sugar out.

30:32.239 --> 30:34.164
-Do you see what's go...
-Okay, okay. Zip it.

30:34.241 --> 30:35.374
-[Cricket] Boss.
-Zip it.

30:35.376 --> 30:36.792
You've already used yours,
give me some.

30:36.794 --> 30:39.628
-[indistinct]
-Ah.

30:39.672 --> 30:41.421
I know I'm not supposed
to say anything but--

30:41.498 --> 30:43.715
No, you're not supposed
to say anything, ever.

30:43.717 --> 30:45.509
[whispers] All right,
all right, thank you.

30:46.762 --> 30:48.095
-I--
-Just.

30:48.097 --> 30:49.429
But did you see what happened?

30:49.506 --> 30:50.839
Kandi put something--

30:50.850 --> 30:53.600
Allow me to remind you
that I expect silence.

30:54.353 --> 30:56.311
30 seconds.

31:05.739 --> 31:08.156
-[timer buzzes]
-Time's up, bakers.

31:08.701 --> 31:11.702
We'll just walk
right past that.

31:11.778 --> 31:14.663
Oh, that looks too nice
to actually eat.

31:14.665 --> 31:16.164
Well done.

31:16.166 --> 31:17.624
Hmm.

31:19.128 --> 31:22.129
Hmm, exquisite. Well done.

31:29.096 --> 31:32.598
Well, that's how
the cookie crumbles, isn't it?

31:34.476 --> 31:37.311
Ooh, intriguing.

31:40.024 --> 31:42.399
Not bad, not bad. Thank you.

31:44.153 --> 31:45.736
That looks lovely.

31:49.116 --> 31:50.240
[groans softly]

31:52.453 --> 31:54.870
I don't think I've ever
tasted a cookie

31:54.914 --> 31:57.956
that makes me regret
becoming a baker.

31:58.751 --> 32:00.792
But she did finish.

32:01.879 --> 32:03.295
[clears throat]

32:03.881 --> 32:05.505
This looks wonderful.

32:05.507 --> 32:07.215
Thank you. Thank you.

32:07.259 --> 32:10.385
-[Felix] Mmm, very, very nice.
-Thank you.

32:10.429 --> 32:12.012
-Very nice.
-Broussard bakery.

32:12.089 --> 32:13.722
[both chuckle]

32:15.643 --> 32:18.894
[Felix] This looks wonderful.

32:18.938 --> 32:24.733
The winner of the first
<i> Bake Wars</i>  competition
is Kandi Kakes.

32:24.735 --> 32:26.610
[applause]

32:30.908 --> 32:32.950
Okay.

32:32.952 --> 32:35.494
[sighs]
Congratulations, Kandi.

32:35.496 --> 32:37.955
I tasted maybe
two good cookies.

32:39.083 --> 32:40.791
You sabotaged my cookies.

32:41.126 --> 32:42.501
What?

32:43.128 --> 32:45.712
You sabotaged my cookies.

32:45.789 --> 32:47.005
I don't know
what you're talking about.

32:47.007 --> 32:50.342
My cookies taste like salt.

32:50.419 --> 32:54.137
Maybe that's just you
trying to do your vegan thing
and it got out of hand.

32:54.139 --> 32:54.863
-I don't know.
-No.

32:54.865 --> 32:56.122
What are you doing?

32:56.124 --> 32:59.142
I asked you for sugar
and you gave me salt.

32:59.144 --> 33:02.896
You're the one who said
we need to boost
social media engagement.

33:02.898 --> 33:04.606
-I didn't give you salt.
-That's exactly what you did.

33:04.608 --> 33:06.149
I gave you sugar.

33:06.151 --> 33:07.859
-Look, this conversation
is over, so--
-No, it's not.

33:07.861 --> 33:10.404
Look, just go... Oh, oh.

33:11.448 --> 33:14.241
-Seriously?
-I'm so sorry.

33:14.243 --> 33:16.284
That was an accident.
I promise you.

33:16.286 --> 33:18.412
-Julian!
-I'm, I'm sorry.

33:18.414 --> 33:20.497
[Brianna] This was
totally on purpose.

33:21.208 --> 33:22.624
Oh, my God.

33:23.002 --> 33:24.543
Sorry.

33:25.295 --> 33:27.421
[Brianna] Don't say
nothing else to me.

33:27.497 --> 33:30.048
We all have nothing else
to talk about for the rest
of this competition.

33:41.895 --> 33:43.437
-Mom, wake up!
-What?

33:43.439 --> 33:45.731
-You've gone viral.
-What? What?

33:45.807 --> 33:47.048
-[Brianna] <i> That's why.</i>
-[Julian] <i> I'm cheating?</i>

33:47.084 --> 33:49.084
-[Brianna] <i> Yes.</i>
-[Julian] <i> Really?</i>

33:49.086 --> 33:49.901
-[Brianna] <i> That's exactly</i>
<i> what you're--</i>
-[Julian] <i> Okay, Brianna.</i>

33:49.978 --> 33:51.069
What do you mean viral?

33:51.071 --> 33:52.362
[Brianna on video] <i> No.</i>

33:52.364 --> 33:53.989
<i> Broussards don't cheat.</i>
<i> We don't need--</i>

33:53.991 --> 33:56.783
Oh, my God, I cannot believe
Julian threw flour at me.

33:56.785 --> 33:58.452
-[Julian] <i> This conversation</i>
<i> is over so--</i>
-[Brianna] <i> No, it's not.</i>

33:58.454 --> 34:00.078
<i> Look, just go... Oh, oh.</i>

34:00.080 --> 34:01.705
-[Brianna] Jesus.
-No, he didn't.

34:01.707 --> 34:03.040
Huh?

34:03.042 --> 34:04.458
Are you sure?

34:04.460 --> 34:05.792
<i> That's exactly what you did</i>

34:05.794 --> 34:08.253
<i> Look, just go... Oh, oh.</i>

34:08.330 --> 34:10.255
<i> -Seriously!</i>
<i> -That was an accident.</i>

34:10.257 --> 34:11.715
<i> I promise you.</i>

34:11.792 --> 34:15.677
[groaning] Oh, my goodness.
I've embarrassed myself.

34:15.679 --> 34:17.888
Ooh, and I've embarrassed you.

34:17.890 --> 34:19.306
I'm in middle school.

34:19.308 --> 34:21.558
Food fights happen
on the regular in my life.

34:21.635 --> 34:24.144
That doesn't make me
feel any better.

34:24.221 --> 34:26.313
God, Julian brings out
the worst in me.

34:28.067 --> 34:30.776
Well, people are
rooting for you
to win this competition.

34:30.778 --> 34:32.527
Hmm? Really?

34:32.571 --> 34:34.312
Look at the comments.

34:34.314 --> 34:37.115
People want to know more
about sugar-free
and vegan desserts.

34:37.192 --> 34:38.533
I can't believe it.

34:39.119 --> 34:41.495
Time to accept your destiny.

34:41.497 --> 34:42.579
Namaste, Mom.

34:42.581 --> 34:45.916
Get. Get. Get out of here.

34:49.463 --> 34:53.840
<i> Felix, we haven't seen</i>
<i> numbers like this</i>
<i> on your show for ages.</i>

34:53.917 --> 34:55.967
<i> -Behind the scenes footage</i>
<i> on social media.</i>
-Stop that.

34:55.969 --> 34:57.910
<i> It's driving engagement.</i>

34:57.912 --> 35:00.430
<i> Fans are also</i>
<i> loving Kandi Kakes,</i>
<i> where'd you find her?</i>

35:00.432 --> 35:03.266
-Oh, I actually-
-Kandi's a gem.

35:03.268 --> 35:06.436
I found her and knew
immediately she'd be perfect.

35:06.596 --> 35:08.588
<i> Genius casting, Felix.</i>

35:08.590 --> 35:10.941
<i> Keep this up and we'll be</i>
<i> renewing your contract</i>
<i> by Christmas.</i>

35:12.569 --> 35:15.112
[indistinct conversations]

35:15.906 --> 35:17.989
[Julian laughs]

35:17.991 --> 35:19.449
She did that on purpose.

35:19.451 --> 35:21.201
We have history.
You don't know about it.

35:21.203 --> 35:22.452
-Look how many views--
-You--

35:22.529 --> 35:25.038
[both clear throat]

35:25.040 --> 35:26.498
-Hi, Auntie.
-[chuckles nervously]

35:28.502 --> 35:29.960
What are you two hiding?

35:30.629 --> 35:33.130
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

35:33.132 --> 35:35.215
-You look great today.
-Mom.

35:35.217 --> 35:37.259
Uh, Mom, I can explain.

35:37.261 --> 35:39.219
It's just my job.

35:39.221 --> 35:42.305
Is this what you mean
by bringing attention
to the family business?

35:42.307 --> 35:45.934
Things got
a little out of hand,
but it won't happen again.

35:45.978 --> 35:49.896
Well, see that it doesn't
before you completely destroy
the Broussard reputation.

35:50.315 --> 35:51.648
I'll be back in a while.

35:51.650 --> 35:52.774
Where are you going?

35:52.776 --> 35:54.192
I've got some errands to run.

35:54.778 --> 35:56.111
In the middle of the day?

35:56.113 --> 35:57.571
I'll be back in a few hours.

35:57.647 --> 35:58.697
<i> Au revoir.</i>

36:02.161 --> 36:03.451
What's that about?

36:09.668 --> 36:11.710
Crawford Park Hospital,
please.

36:13.797 --> 36:15.839
[Layne] <i> Thank you</i>
<i> for everything</i>

36:15.841 --> 36:18.008
and for hosting
engagement party
at your place.

36:18.010 --> 36:19.050
Can we bring anything?

36:19.127 --> 36:20.468
No, no, I got it covered.

36:20.470 --> 36:22.404
You know I love Cheryl.

36:22.406 --> 36:26.224
She's an amazing woman
with the patience of Job
to put up with you.

36:26.727 --> 36:28.435
Very funny.

36:28.437 --> 36:31.813
So are you bringing a date
to the engagement party
next week?

36:31.815 --> 36:33.565
-A date? Like who?
-Mmm-hmm.

36:34.067 --> 36:35.275
What about Brianna?

36:35.277 --> 36:37.027
Brianna? You saw the video.

36:37.029 --> 36:39.029
That woman does not like me.

36:39.064 --> 36:40.572
Well, she told me
what happened

36:40.574 --> 36:42.699
between the two of you
in pastry school.

36:42.701 --> 36:45.410
Mmm-hmm, doing the nasty
in the kitchen.

36:45.487 --> 36:47.662
Did she also tell you
that she almost burned down

36:47.664 --> 36:50.832
the entire school doing
the nasty in the kitchen?

36:50.834 --> 36:53.543
She told me things got
hot and heavy
between the two of you.

36:53.620 --> 36:55.503
Really? A fire joke?

36:56.673 --> 36:58.548
Don't you have a TV j...

36:58.625 --> 36:59.507
Radio... What?

36:59.509 --> 37:00.959
What do you do again?

37:01.035 --> 37:03.345
All I'm saying is that
there seems to be some sparks

37:03.347 --> 37:05.639
that can be ignited
between the two of you.

37:06.141 --> 37:07.515
Get out of here.

37:08.644 --> 37:10.018
[laughing] I couldn't resist.

37:10.020 --> 37:11.228
Clean up.

37:19.529 --> 37:20.820
[doorbell rings]

37:21.823 --> 37:23.615
Hey, you're early.

37:24.660 --> 37:26.618
Well, hello, to you too.

37:28.205 --> 37:29.971
Brought a dessert.

37:29.973 --> 37:32.499
I need to finish it
before the rest
of the guests arrive.

37:33.460 --> 37:35.835
Okay, you didn't
need to do that.

37:35.837 --> 37:37.903
I already made dessert.

37:37.905 --> 37:40.632
Well, I figured I'd bring
something that people
would actually want to eat.

37:41.677 --> 37:43.635
[mock laughing]

37:44.221 --> 37:45.345
Very funny.

37:45.347 --> 37:47.514
Uh-huh, your mom's
got a nice spot.

37:47.590 --> 37:49.057
Don't do that.
This is my crib.

37:49.059 --> 37:50.600
[laughing]

37:50.602 --> 37:52.644
Okay.

37:52.721 --> 37:54.604
-Let me take your coat.
-All right.

37:58.151 --> 37:59.651
You smell so good.

37:59.653 --> 38:00.860
Thank you.

38:05.993 --> 38:10.036
Hmm, let me put this
over here.

38:12.958 --> 38:17.961
I also came early
because I wanted to apologize.

38:19.298 --> 38:20.922
Wait a minute.

38:20.924 --> 38:24.426
The Brianna Davison
wants to apologize to me?

38:25.220 --> 38:27.387
Don't make this
harder than it already is.

38:27.389 --> 38:28.722
Okay.

38:28.798 --> 38:31.182
My daughter Willow.
showed me the video of us

38:31.184 --> 38:35.353
and it turns out you didn't
actually throw flour at me.

38:35.355 --> 38:38.356
-Ah, okay.
-Mmm-hmm.

38:39.568 --> 38:40.692
I'm sorry.

38:41.028 --> 38:42.986
Okay.

38:43.063 --> 38:47.198
I was hoping we could call
a truce for the sake
of Cheryl and Layne tonight.

38:48.327 --> 38:49.409
Deal.

38:52.205 --> 38:53.705
Agreed.

38:57.210 --> 39:00.045
Oh, oh, wait a minute.

39:01.173 --> 39:02.897
What is this?

39:02.899 --> 39:05.425
It's my recipe box
with some of my
grandmother's favorites

39:05.502 --> 39:06.718
and some of my new ideas.

39:07.095 --> 39:08.428
Ah.

39:08.972 --> 39:11.389
Shrimp and sausage gumbo.

39:11.391 --> 39:13.975
-Would you stop?
-And this is a peach cobbler.

39:13.977 --> 39:15.894
-Give me that.
-And this is-- [laughs]

39:17.481 --> 39:20.398
This box is going to help me
win <i> Bake Wars.</i>

39:21.818 --> 39:24.611
You're going to need
more than that little box
to take me down.

39:25.197 --> 39:26.863
Challenge accepted.

39:27.824 --> 39:29.532
-Uh-huh.
-Mmm-hmm.

39:29.534 --> 39:32.118
Mmm-hmm. What's that?

39:33.372 --> 39:36.706
This is my
dulce de leche cake.

39:36.783 --> 39:38.958
-Ah.
-My secret recipe.

39:39.419 --> 39:40.960
Hmm.

39:42.047 --> 39:43.797
Can I use this spoon
to finish?

39:43.799 --> 39:45.131
Oh, sure, go ahead.

39:46.593 --> 39:48.468
I'll supervise, in fact.

39:48.545 --> 39:49.636
[chuckles softly]

39:50.430 --> 39:52.013
-Well.
-Mmm-hmm.

39:52.015 --> 39:53.807
Watch and learn.

40:02.567 --> 40:03.900
Just like old times.

40:08.323 --> 40:09.531
Yeah.

40:19.543 --> 40:21.209
[knocking on door]

40:22.129 --> 40:23.461
[knocking on door]

40:24.589 --> 40:26.131
[knocking on door]

40:28.385 --> 40:29.759
[whispers] Get it together.
Come on.

40:32.514 --> 40:33.655
[Julian] So, Mom, I have
someone I want you to meet.

40:34.683 --> 40:37.225
-Hi.
-Brianna, this is the Queen B,

40:37.227 --> 40:38.643
-Sophie Broussard.
-Hi.

40:39.271 --> 40:40.478
Good to meet you.

40:40.480 --> 40:42.021
Pleased to meet you, too.

40:42.858 --> 40:44.274
Well, what have we here?

40:44.276 --> 40:46.484
This is my vegan
dulce de leche cake.

40:46.486 --> 40:50.280
Mom, Brianna is
a very talented vegan baker.

40:50.356 --> 40:51.865
And where's your bakery?

40:51.867 --> 40:53.825
I have a food truck
called Sabon!

40:53.827 --> 40:54.909
Wonderful.

40:54.911 --> 40:55.952
-Julian.
-Yes?

40:55.954 --> 40:57.954
Didn't you make
a dessert also?

40:57.956 --> 41:02.584
Yes, Mom, but Brianna's cake
is so much more festive
than my creme brulee.

41:02.586 --> 41:04.961
I've decided to let this
be the dessert tonight.

41:04.963 --> 41:06.921
I love your creme brulee.

41:06.965 --> 41:09.549
Brianna, have you tried
Julian's creme brulee?

41:09.626 --> 41:11.509
-I--
<i> -C'est magnifique.</i>

41:12.804 --> 41:15.680
Thankfully, you can never have
too many desserts at a party.

41:15.682 --> 41:18.391
[Julian] Mmm-hmm.
We had a lot of creme brulee
one time.

41:18.468 --> 41:20.393
-[laughs nervously]
-Just <i> magnifique.</i>

41:20.395 --> 41:22.562
[laughing]

41:22.564 --> 41:24.147
Now tell me about this cake.

41:24.900 --> 41:26.232
Cousin.

41:27.694 --> 41:30.111
Absolutely. Happy to do it.

41:30.113 --> 41:32.530
Cheryl. Come in.

41:34.034 --> 41:36.576
To Layne and Cheryl.

41:36.578 --> 41:38.828
Cheers.

41:40.040 --> 41:43.416
[indistinct conversations]

41:45.587 --> 41:47.003
Where's the Hennessy?

41:51.843 --> 41:55.136
[Julian] Cake, cake, cake,
cake, cake, cake.

41:55.180 --> 41:58.097
Cake, cake, cake,
cake, cake, cake.

41:59.601 --> 42:01.726
[Layne] Hey, look at that.

42:01.803 --> 42:04.145
You can't tell me
how much to take.

42:07.067 --> 42:10.443
[Julian] So long as we can
eat as much as we want
and we don't gain weight.

42:23.583 --> 42:26.000
[indistinct conversation]

42:28.588 --> 42:30.046
[Layne] All right, go girl.

42:31.216 --> 42:32.957
Thank you.

42:43.895 --> 42:47.021
Thank you for this
lovely dinner, Julian.
It was the perfect night.

42:47.023 --> 42:48.856
You're very welcome, cuz.

42:48.900 --> 42:50.650
Thanks, sis.

42:50.652 --> 42:52.151
-[cellphone pings]
-That cake was divine.

42:52.153 --> 42:53.594
Thank you.

42:53.596 --> 42:55.238
It's a good thing you two
patched things up tonight.

42:55.240 --> 42:57.056
-Why?
-Why's that?

42:57.058 --> 42:59.033
[Layne] I just got an update
for the next
<i> Bake Wars</i>  challenge,

42:59.077 --> 43:00.952
and you and Julian
are paired together.

43:03.415 --> 43:05.331
-I already got an idea.
-You've already got an idea.

43:05.333 --> 43:07.709
You two will be
great together.

43:08.503 --> 43:10.128
Come on,
I'll walk everyone out.

43:10.964 --> 43:12.505
Today's challenge is
for our teams

43:12.507 --> 43:16.301
to put a funky twist
on a holiday dessert trio.

43:16.303 --> 43:20.096
The team that comes
in last place
will be eliminated.

43:20.098 --> 43:22.724
Our contestants have
two hours to shop

43:22.726 --> 43:24.559
and two hours to bake,

43:24.561 --> 43:27.353
and then, we'll see
what they can do.

43:28.607 --> 43:32.066
Bakers, let's go shopping.

43:32.101 --> 43:33.726
[contestants] Ooh.

43:35.280 --> 43:38.406
So what does the new wave
of Broussard pastries
look like?

43:38.450 --> 43:42.910
Ah, I've been working
on a new line
of bourbon infused pastries.

43:42.912 --> 43:47.081
Croissants with bourbon,
pecan flavored glaze, what?

43:47.125 --> 43:51.961
Mini cheesecake puffs
and a bourbon caramel sauce
and a fig.

43:51.963 --> 43:54.881
And my favorite,
bourbon toffee cake.

43:54.883 --> 43:57.258
-Uh, okay.
-Yes.

43:57.302 --> 44:00.011
-I love that idea.
-It's going to be banging.

44:00.088 --> 44:03.431
It's like bourbon tasting,
but with desserts.

44:03.475 --> 44:04.599
Yes.

44:05.435 --> 44:07.093
-Wait a minute.
-What?

44:07.169 --> 44:09.646
-Okay, that gives me an idea
for the competition.
-Okay.

44:09.722 --> 44:13.024
Okay, when you said that,
it made me think.

44:13.026 --> 44:16.903
-Why don't we take your idea
of whiskey tasting, right?
-Okay.

44:16.905 --> 44:18.863
And recreate
southern desserts?

44:19.824 --> 44:21.074
All right.

44:21.076 --> 44:22.909
Classic southern desserts.

44:22.985 --> 44:24.869
-It's good?
-Yeah, that looks great.

44:24.946 --> 44:26.779
You know what, they should
be back any minute.

44:26.856 --> 44:29.957
Let's get the crew back in,
get the cameras
in position, please.

44:29.959 --> 44:32.085
-You're from New Orleans?
-Born and raised.

44:32.087 --> 44:34.295
Don't know nothing about
Cash Money Records.

44:34.297 --> 44:37.382
Taking over for the nine
out in the 2009.

44:37.384 --> 44:38.383
But then how did you
get to Philly?

44:38.459 --> 44:42.261
Well, classic romcom plot.

44:42.338 --> 44:46.516
Girl meets boy at Mardi Gras
and then girl follows boy
to Philadelphia.

44:46.518 --> 44:49.143
Hmm, so what happened?

44:49.145 --> 44:52.271
Well, girl gets
her heart broken
when she realizes that

44:52.273 --> 44:56.234
boy loves his music career
and his life on the road
more than he does her.

44:56.236 --> 44:58.236
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

44:59.364 --> 45:02.824
Well, I got Willow,
made our 20s drama
well worth it.

45:04.411 --> 45:06.369
She's actually the inspiration
behind my business.

45:06.446 --> 45:08.095
Oh, how so?

45:08.097 --> 45:10.665
Well, when she was seven,
she was diagnosed
with diabetes

45:10.709 --> 45:14.335
and she was prescribed
a very strict diet,

45:14.421 --> 45:17.338
and I had to learn
to prepare her meals
completely different.

45:18.591 --> 45:20.466
Is that why you're
in the competition?

45:20.543 --> 45:21.968
Well, that's one
of the reasons, yeah.

45:21.970 --> 45:23.761
Okay, so what's
another reason?

45:23.763 --> 45:27.557
Well, our rocket scientist
got into Fallbrook.

45:27.633 --> 45:29.976
And I got to figure out a way
to pay some tuition.

45:30.052 --> 45:33.062
I just want to give her
the biggest runway,
so she can soar.

45:34.149 --> 45:35.606
You're a good mom.

45:37.110 --> 45:38.568
Thank you.

45:39.571 --> 45:43.823
Well, maybe Grandma Sadie
can help us with the recipes.

45:43.825 --> 45:47.702
-I hope so, but--
-Look, these desserts
are going to be amazing.

45:47.704 --> 45:51.330
-Well, we better win,
or it's all on you.
-Oh.

45:51.332 --> 45:54.167
-Yeah, and Grandma Sadie.
-Stop it.

45:54.169 --> 45:56.461
[clock ticking]

45:58.173 --> 46:01.257
-Okay, this is looking good.
-Yeah, yeah.

46:01.259 --> 46:02.717
I like your style, sir.

46:02.719 --> 46:05.386
Ah, thank you, Miss Brianna.

46:05.388 --> 46:08.306
Looks like Julian and Brianna
have mended fences.

46:08.308 --> 46:11.934
Mmm, mended fences
don't make great TV.

46:14.147 --> 46:16.105
[timer buzzes]

46:18.735 --> 46:20.151
Time's up, bakers.

46:27.869 --> 46:28.910
Dreadful.

46:29.579 --> 46:30.703
And this

46:32.290 --> 46:33.915
could break a window.

46:35.835 --> 46:38.211
What do you have for us today,
Kandi Kakes?

46:38.287 --> 46:42.548
I have made a red velvet trio,
it is sweet and sassy.

46:42.550 --> 46:43.991
Like me.

46:46.429 --> 46:50.556
The glaze is an unexpected
yet refreshing surprise.

46:50.633 --> 46:51.757
Nice touch.

46:52.477 --> 46:54.268
[chuckling] Good luck
beating that.

46:54.270 --> 46:56.562
Well, we'll see.

46:56.564 --> 46:59.982
What did #teamflourfeud
come up with today?

46:59.984 --> 47:03.528
[laughing] A trio full of
bourbon-filled desserts.

47:07.200 --> 47:09.450
I think we have a winner.

47:09.452 --> 47:11.494
Brianna and Julian.

47:11.496 --> 47:13.371
Boom! Yes.

47:13.373 --> 47:15.039
-[screams]
-That's what
I'm talking about.

47:15.116 --> 47:17.458
[Damon] Way to go, baby.

47:17.460 --> 47:19.210
[Julian] Looks like you
have a fan club.

47:19.212 --> 47:22.255
-What?
-Yeah, over there.

47:22.257 --> 47:25.800
Oh, that's,
that's Willow's father.

47:28.263 --> 47:29.220
Hi, baby.

47:30.098 --> 47:31.806
[laughs]

47:33.059 --> 47:34.976
We came to surprise you.
You killed it, Mom.

47:35.019 --> 47:36.435
Thank you, baby.

47:36.437 --> 47:39.146
Damon, what, um,
what are you doing?

47:39.190 --> 47:42.817
Bri, I heard your messages.
I got off the tour
as soon as I could.

47:42.819 --> 47:46.028
Our beautiful daughter here
thought you can
do with the surprise.

47:46.030 --> 47:47.530
Daddy's home
for Christmas, baby.

47:47.607 --> 47:49.282
[Willow] Surprise.

47:49.284 --> 47:51.409
[Brianna grunts uncomfortably]

47:58.334 --> 47:59.792
So happy we're all together.

48:07.218 --> 48:08.301
[Willow] How was
the tour, Dad?

48:09.304 --> 48:10.720
It was great.

48:10.722 --> 48:13.723
15 cities, 15 sold out shows.

48:13.799 --> 48:16.392
Your dad's guitar always
kept the crowd on their feet.

48:16.394 --> 48:18.311
Will you teach me how to play?

48:18.313 --> 48:19.270
You promised last time.

48:19.347 --> 48:21.063
Promises. Promises.

48:21.140 --> 48:24.066
Of course, we don't go back
on the road
until after Christmas.

48:24.068 --> 48:25.818
By the time I leave
to go back on tour,

48:25.820 --> 48:27.278
you'll be ready
to hit the road with me.

48:27.280 --> 48:28.779
Thanks, Dad.
I'm glad you're here.

48:28.781 --> 48:31.449
Me too. Look, I'm sorry
I couldn't call often.

48:31.525 --> 48:34.035
When I finished the show,
it would be too late
to call then--

48:38.207 --> 48:39.707
Then you'd be in school
when I woke up.

48:39.709 --> 48:40.791
It's okay, Dad.

48:40.793 --> 48:42.209
Like that telescope
I sent you?

48:42.211 --> 48:43.502
Yes, I love it.

48:43.504 --> 48:45.171
All right,
young lady, homework.

48:45.173 --> 48:47.256
Mom, do I have to?

48:47.258 --> 48:49.884
Yeah, Mom, does she have to?

48:49.886 --> 48:51.344
One of us has to be an adult.

48:51.346 --> 48:52.653
Upstairs.

48:52.655 --> 48:54.305
Speaking of, Damon,
where are you staying?

48:54.382 --> 48:56.432
Why can't Dad stay here
with us?

48:56.509 --> 48:59.310
Oh, sweetie, I'm sure Daddy's
already made arrangements.

48:59.938 --> 49:01.062
Actually, I haven't.

49:01.064 --> 49:02.855
See, Mom?
Dad can stay here with us.

49:02.932 --> 49:04.732
I'll go make the guest bed.

49:10.865 --> 49:12.031
You did that on purpose.

49:12.066 --> 49:14.099
What do you mean?

49:14.101 --> 49:17.119
Our daughter might not be hip
to your manipulation,
but you can't fool me.

49:17.121 --> 49:20.164
Would be so bad
if I stayed here
with my two favorite girls?

49:20.282 --> 49:21.165
Damon, please,
don't even try it.

49:21.167 --> 49:22.917
What are you doing here?

49:22.961 --> 49:24.961
Got my agent to get me a gig
out here in Philly

49:25.037 --> 49:28.005
so I could spend Christmas
with Willow and you.

49:28.007 --> 49:29.632
I've been calling you
for months.

49:29.634 --> 49:30.675
And then, just,
all of a sudden,

49:30.677 --> 49:32.151
out of the blue,
you show up here,

49:32.228 --> 49:34.679
and get our daughter excited
about you staying here?

49:34.681 --> 49:37.014
Well, guess who has to pick up
the pieces when you leave?

49:37.350 --> 49:38.766
Got your messages, Bri.

49:38.810 --> 49:40.768
That's another reason
why I wanted to see you.

49:40.770 --> 49:42.103
What's going on
with this school?

49:42.105 --> 49:44.563
It's the best school
in the city.

49:44.565 --> 49:48.025
But even with financial aid,
I can't swing it by myself.

49:51.698 --> 49:53.823
[whistles] Wow.

49:54.701 --> 49:56.242
That's a hefty price tag.

49:56.244 --> 49:58.077
You sure she can't stay
in public school?

49:58.079 --> 50:00.329
She's got her heart
set on going to that school.

50:02.834 --> 50:05.209
Okay, then we'll
figure something out.

50:07.088 --> 50:08.796
Thank you, Damon.

50:09.424 --> 50:11.257
Now, about you staying here.

50:11.259 --> 50:13.759
Look, I could stay
at a hotel if you want.

50:13.761 --> 50:16.595
But we both know
that'd break Willow's heart.

50:16.672 --> 50:20.808
Plus, staying here
will help me save more money
towards Willow's tuition.

50:22.311 --> 50:25.312
Fine. But you're staying
in the guest room.

50:37.368 --> 50:38.951
[cellphone vibrating]

50:39.912 --> 50:41.871
Hey, Layne.

50:41.873 --> 50:44.081
<i> Hey, sis, just coming</i>
<i> from the gym,</i>
<i> wanted to check up on you.</i>

50:44.083 --> 50:46.876
You didn't look too happy
when you saw Damon
at the competition.

50:46.952 --> 50:49.003
Child, I'm happy Willow
has her father here,

50:49.005 --> 50:50.713
but you know he's always going
to be on my naughty list.

50:50.715 --> 50:52.623
<i> I feel you.</i>

50:52.625 --> 50:54.341
<i> Come meet me for a drink,</i>
<i> you sound like you could</i>
<i> use one.</i>

50:54.844 --> 50:56.385
<i> I'll see you in a bit.</i>

50:56.462 --> 50:57.595
Sounds good.

51:00.475 --> 51:03.142
All right, Pete,
that's it for me.

51:03.144 --> 51:05.770
Ooh, care to buy
a baker a drink?

51:05.772 --> 51:07.104
Hey, Kandi.

51:07.774 --> 51:08.731
Ah.

51:09.400 --> 51:10.524
Pete.

51:10.943 --> 51:12.234
Whatever the lady wants.

51:12.236 --> 51:16.363
Oh, okay, well, I will have
the holiday sangria.

51:16.365 --> 51:18.324
You know what?
I'll have one too.

51:20.078 --> 51:23.454
So, uh, you here by yourself?

51:23.531 --> 51:25.539
-Not anymore.
-[chuckles]

51:25.541 --> 51:27.333
Shall we take a seat?

51:27.752 --> 51:29.126
Okay, why not.

51:36.928 --> 51:38.803
Ooh, here?

51:39.972 --> 51:43.224
Ooh, okay, okay.

51:43.768 --> 51:45.726
Drinks menu.

51:45.728 --> 51:49.021
We'll start with these.
Two champagne cocktails.

51:49.023 --> 51:52.942
To the <i> Bake Wars</i>  competitin
and new friends.

51:53.018 --> 51:54.860
Yeah, new friends.

51:56.781 --> 52:00.157
Ooh, I see your partner
had the same idea.

52:00.159 --> 52:01.242
Huh?

52:01.536 --> 52:02.618
Oh.

52:03.371 --> 52:04.537
[chuckles]

52:06.415 --> 52:08.958
So I was thinking,
for the engagement--

52:08.960 --> 52:10.417
Who are you waving at?

52:10.837 --> 52:12.461
[laughs]

52:12.538 --> 52:14.797
What brought you
to the competition?

52:14.874 --> 52:16.549
I mean,
I'm a social media baker,

52:16.551 --> 52:19.510
but, like,
I want my own TV show.

52:20.471 --> 52:23.264
Okay, Julian, Brianna,
Kandi, Jack are left.

52:23.307 --> 52:25.558
Obviously, we should pair
Julian and Brianna together.

52:25.560 --> 52:26.892
Yeah, I agree.

52:26.969 --> 52:28.602
[cellphone pings and vibrates]

52:32.066 --> 52:33.357
What's that?

52:35.528 --> 52:37.820
Looks like we might
have a love connection.

52:39.157 --> 52:40.197
[Julian] Uh.

52:40.700 --> 52:41.824
Guys.

52:42.577 --> 52:44.577
Guys.

52:44.579 --> 52:48.956
Hey, listen, we do not have
the bourbon bread pudding.
I'm sorry.

52:48.958 --> 52:51.375
But we saw you make
the bourbon bread pudding
on <i> Bake Wars.</i>

52:51.377 --> 52:53.377
Those desserts
were just for the show.

52:53.379 --> 52:55.337
I drove all the way
from Glenside to try it.

52:55.339 --> 52:57.464
Yeah, me too.
I came all the way
from Trenton.

52:57.466 --> 53:01.802
Listen, people, we do not have
any of the desserts
you've seen on the show.

53:01.846 --> 53:06.807
But we a wide assortment
of delicious French pastries
you'll love.

53:06.851 --> 53:08.434
-[Julian] Yes.
-Who can I help?

53:08.510 --> 53:10.477
Maybe we should try to find
Brianna's food truck.

53:10.479 --> 53:12.146
Yeah, that's a good idea.

53:12.190 --> 53:14.023
Yeah, call AAA,
they'll know where she is.

53:14.025 --> 53:15.357
What just happened?

53:15.434 --> 53:17.193
They came to try
some of the desserts

53:17.195 --> 53:19.111
Brianna and I made
on the TV show.

53:19.864 --> 53:21.822
Bourbon bread pudding?

53:22.116 --> 53:23.949
Sounds... [speaks French]

53:23.951 --> 53:28.954
Well, it impressed the judge
because we won
that competition.

53:30.208 --> 53:33.000
-[stutters] What is
going on, Julian?
-What?

53:33.044 --> 53:34.435
Sounds like you're
turning your back

53:34.437 --> 53:36.670
on everything I taught you
with this competition.

53:36.714 --> 53:37.963
We have to keep up
with the times.

53:37.965 --> 53:39.698
There is nothing wrong
with our menu.

53:39.700 --> 53:42.509
I didn't say there was
something wrong
with the menu, I...

53:42.511 --> 53:46.597
I'm just saying
that I have a lot of ideas
that I would like to try.

53:46.674 --> 53:50.726
I sacrificed everything
to build this for you.

53:50.761 --> 53:53.729
Mom, you've done
an amazing job.

53:53.731 --> 53:56.732
You've built
an amazing legacy,
Sophie Broussard.

53:56.734 --> 53:59.568
And now, I just want
to build on that.

53:59.645 --> 54:03.447
I want to talk to companies
about starting a line
of Broussard baked goods

54:03.449 --> 54:06.075
in stores
all across the country.

54:06.077 --> 54:10.579
And I'm pretty sure
the exposure of this TV show
will help me do that.

54:10.656 --> 54:12.206
I'm just looking
toward the future.

54:12.833 --> 54:14.208
[Sophie sighs]

54:14.252 --> 54:15.542
Mom, you okay?

54:16.254 --> 54:17.920
-I'm fine.
-Are you sure?

54:18.464 --> 54:21.257
-Hey.
-Good morning, Layne.

54:21.259 --> 54:23.676
How are you doing, my dear?

54:23.678 --> 54:26.303
I'm good, Aunt Soph, I'm good.

54:26.305 --> 54:28.681
Not as good as our Julian.

54:28.683 --> 54:30.391
And what's that
supposed to mean?

54:35.564 --> 54:37.856
What is a Kandi Kakes?

54:37.858 --> 54:42.611
Uh, she's one of
the contestants on the show.

54:42.613 --> 54:46.615
Well, according
to Felix Starr's caption,
you two are, "baking buddies."

54:46.692 --> 54:48.066
That's a lie.

54:48.101 --> 54:50.452
She's just a contestant
on the show, nothing more.

54:50.529 --> 54:54.790
You see?
This is why I didn't want you
to do this silly show.

54:54.792 --> 54:56.417
[speaks French]

54:56.419 --> 54:59.336
What? Mom, I'm not...
I don't mean to embarrass you.

54:59.413 --> 55:00.921
Really, there's
nothing going on.

55:00.965 --> 55:03.215
Ooh.

55:03.217 --> 55:04.425
Layne, what are you doing?

55:04.427 --> 55:06.193
Don't blame me.

55:06.195 --> 55:09.054
You were the one
that went out with
Miss Kandi Kakes last night.

55:09.131 --> 55:11.598
We just happened to be
in the same place
at the same time.

55:11.600 --> 55:13.475
-Really?
-Really.

55:13.477 --> 55:17.187
Well, I think I'm picking up
on some chemistry
between you and Brianna.

55:17.189 --> 55:19.523
-Brianna?
-Mmm-hmm.

55:19.600 --> 55:23.235
Neither one of you
are over that botched
one night stand.

55:23.237 --> 55:25.612
I'm over it. Pssh. Tch.

55:25.614 --> 55:27.489
Telling me I'm not over it.
I've, I've been over it.

55:27.491 --> 55:29.408
Okay. Sure.

55:29.410 --> 55:31.309
Last time I saw Brianna,

55:31.311 --> 55:33.912
she really had her hands full
when she was
leaving the competition.

55:33.989 --> 55:34.872
I think she's busy.

55:34.948 --> 55:37.082
Damon? Damon's her ex-husband.

55:37.084 --> 55:38.167
There's nothing
going on there.

55:38.169 --> 55:40.151
So you think
I should talk to her, huh?

55:40.229 --> 55:44.298
I think you guys need
to clear the air before
the last two challenges.

55:44.342 --> 55:45.382
All right.

55:45.384 --> 55:47.551
What was the whole
Kandi Kakes about?

55:47.628 --> 55:49.470
-I'm pushing you
in the right direction.
-You're trying to give my mom

55:49.505 --> 55:50.587
a heart attack.

55:50.589 --> 55:52.139
-Don't worry about that.
-Kandi Kake?

55:52.141 --> 55:55.434
-Love you. Mmm-hmm.
-No more free samples for you.

56:08.240 --> 56:09.990
[Julian] Oh, come on, Philly.

56:10.451 --> 56:13.202
-Julian.
-Hi, ma.

56:13.204 --> 56:14.995
Thought I took that key back.

56:15.039 --> 56:16.622
I made copies.

56:18.376 --> 56:19.500
I was hungry.

56:19.502 --> 56:23.087
Ah, coq au vin, my favorite.

56:23.089 --> 56:25.881
You used to love it
when I made this for you
as a kid.

56:25.883 --> 56:26.924
I'll go get plates.

56:26.926 --> 56:28.258
Sit down, Julian.

56:28.260 --> 56:29.760
We need to talk.

56:29.762 --> 56:31.011
Okay.

56:31.931 --> 56:34.014
What's up?

56:34.016 --> 56:36.475
Even though
we don't always agree,

56:36.552 --> 56:38.644
I hope you know
I'm proud of you, Julian.

56:38.646 --> 56:40.729
Oh, Mom,
I'm proud of you, too.

56:41.857 --> 56:44.525
And I know it hasn't always
been easy at the bakery,

56:44.527 --> 56:48.529
and my ideas
are a bit old-fashioned.

56:48.531 --> 56:52.908
Hey, we've had over 30 years
of success at the bakery

56:52.985 --> 56:54.910
and that's
because of your vision.

56:57.039 --> 56:58.163
[sighs]

56:59.750 --> 57:01.291
Ma, what's going on?

57:03.129 --> 57:05.838
I've been diagnosed
with a neurological disorder

57:05.840 --> 57:08.924
that affects
the nerves in my hands.

57:09.001 --> 57:11.301
That's why I was rushing out
in the middle of the day.

57:11.303 --> 57:13.011
I was seeing a specialist.

57:14.265 --> 57:15.931
Why didn't you tell me?

57:16.350 --> 57:17.641
I would've gone with you.

57:17.643 --> 57:19.476
I wasn't willing
to face the fact

57:19.478 --> 57:23.397
that I would soon no longer
be able to do the thing
that I love.

57:25.276 --> 57:28.193
But, today, the doctor
confirmed the diagnosis.

57:28.946 --> 57:31.822
Okay, what did he say?

57:31.940 --> 57:36.827
They gave me medication
to deal with the tightness
and discomfort.

57:38.539 --> 57:40.080
But it's going to progress.

57:46.714 --> 57:48.005
I'm sorry, Ma.

57:48.674 --> 57:51.425
Actually, it's me
that's sorry.

57:53.387 --> 57:55.304
What are you sorry about?

57:58.559 --> 58:02.936
When I think about no longer
having the bakery
in my life every day,

58:03.397 --> 58:04.897
I realize

58:06.108 --> 58:08.108
I don't have anyone
to share my life with.

58:08.944 --> 58:11.820
And I don't want you
to be the same way.

58:13.949 --> 58:15.616
What are you talking about?

58:18.120 --> 58:20.454
Everyone thought
that I was crazy

58:20.498 --> 58:22.414
when I left my post
as pastry chef

58:22.416 --> 58:26.251
at the White House
to move to Paris,

58:26.328 --> 58:29.755
study at Le Cordon Bleu,
but it was the best decision.

58:30.716 --> 58:32.257
I met your father.

58:33.552 --> 58:37.095
A handsome writer
who swept me off my feet.

58:37.932 --> 58:39.223
Then I got you.

58:39.934 --> 58:42.059
Wish I would've gotten
to know him better.

58:42.135 --> 58:45.771
When your father died,
I threw myself
into the bakery.

58:45.773 --> 58:49.191
I didn't have time
to fall in love again.

58:49.268 --> 58:52.945
I was so busy raising you
and building
a world class bakery.

58:52.947 --> 58:54.655
But there has to be more.

58:55.491 --> 58:58.617
Someone to share
your life with.

58:58.619 --> 59:01.620
You gave me a passion,
that's priceless.

59:01.622 --> 59:03.205
That's love.

59:03.282 --> 59:05.082
And the only thing we need
to do together

59:05.084 --> 59:07.793
is worry about the future
of the Broussard brand.

59:08.712 --> 59:10.003
I'm glad you're here.

59:11.549 --> 59:13.507
I've really been wanting
to show you this.

59:13.551 --> 59:14.841
Just take a look.

59:32.236 --> 59:33.652
This is amazing, Julian.

59:33.729 --> 59:34.987
Uh-huh.

59:34.989 --> 59:36.697
I should've listened
to you sooner.

59:38.284 --> 59:39.533
[laughs]

59:39.577 --> 59:41.451
I launched this bakery.

59:41.453 --> 59:42.953
I got stuck in my ways.

59:43.030 --> 59:44.395
Whoa.

59:44.473 --> 59:46.665
Did you just admit you were
stuck in your ways?

59:46.742 --> 59:47.916
Stuck, but not stupid.

59:47.918 --> 59:51.086
I know we have to evolve
with the future.

59:51.088 --> 59:55.257
[sighs] But your passion
can't be just about pastry.

59:55.259 --> 59:56.499
What does that mean?

59:56.576 --> 59:58.927
I have a lot of passions
outside of pastries.

59:58.929 --> 1:00:00.429
Listen to me, Julian.

1:00:00.431 --> 1:00:03.015
You cannot make
the same mistakes that I made.

1:00:03.017 --> 1:00:04.891
To devote your
entire life to work.

1:00:07.271 --> 1:00:09.229
What about that vegan girl.

1:00:09.565 --> 1:00:10.772
Brielle.

1:00:10.774 --> 1:00:13.650
-Hmm, Brianna.
-Brianna.

1:00:13.727 --> 1:00:15.736
She's just a contestant
on the show.

1:00:15.771 --> 1:00:17.854

that conversation.

to help you keep your show

1:01:09.124 --> 1:01:10.832
Would you excuse us, Cricket?

1:01:13.504 --> 1:01:16.338
Uh, we have to discuss
tonight's competition.

I think we can both help
each other get what we want.

1:01:43.200 --> 1:01:44.658
What do you mean, Kandi?

1:01:44.660 --> 1:01:46.443
Well, you need the show
to succeed,

1:01:46.519 --> 1:01:50.247
and I need to win
this competition to get
my TV career started.

1:01:50.249 --> 1:01:51.957
So you want to be my co-star?

1:01:51.959 --> 1:01:53.366
[laughs] No.

1:01:53.368 --> 1:01:57.254
I want to be a TV star,
not a food show host.

1:01:57.256 --> 1:02:01.842
But if I win, I get an agent,
I move to Hollywood.

1:02:02.553 --> 1:02:03.802
And I keep my show.

1:02:03.887 --> 1:02:05.962
Exactly.

you get the right ingredients.

But you must use

under your box.

1:02:26.827 --> 1:02:28.952
And there's a twist.

1:02:29.747 --> 1:02:32.789
In addition
to the $50,000 prize,

1:02:32.866 --> 1:02:35.751
the winner
of the <i> All-Starr Bake War</i>

1:02:35.753 --> 1:02:39.963

1:05:34.139 --> 1:05:37.307
<i> The three of them will</i>
<i> face-off in the final round</i>

1:05:37.384 --> 1:05:40.518
<i> to be held tomorrow</i>
<i> on Christmas Eve.</i>

1:05:40.520 --> 1:05:42.979
<i> Jack, you're eliminated.</i>

1:05:42.981 --> 1:05:45.148
[mild applause]

1:05:53.325 --> 1:05:55.992
Hey, Mom, you made it.

1:05:55.994 --> 1:05:57.869
Yes, and I'm glad I did.

1:05:57.946 --> 1:05:59.537
I'm so proud of you, son.

1:05:59.614 --> 1:06:00.956
Oh, thank you, Mom.

1:06:00.958 --> 1:06:04.000
You took something old
and made it new.

1:06:04.002 --> 1:06:06.586
<i> Le macaron c'est magnifique</i>

1:06:06.630 --> 1:06:08.213
You need to put these
on the menu.

1:06:08.215 --> 1:06:10.131
Really?

1:06:10.133 --> 1:06:13.218
I'm sure some of your new fans
will be coming by tomorrow
looking for them.

1:06:13.220 --> 1:06:14.302
Absolutely.

1:06:15.555 --> 1:06:16.638
You're the best.

1:06:16.640 --> 1:06:17.889
-Thank you, baby.
-Oh, wow.

1:06:17.966 --> 1:06:19.808
[both laugh]

1:06:19.810 --> 1:06:22.018
Okay, finish packing it up,
stack the plates,
paper between them, okay?

1:06:22.020 --> 1:06:23.144
-Okay.
-Great.

1:06:30.362 --> 1:06:31.945
[chuckles] Oh, no.

1:06:31.947 --> 1:06:34.072
I hope you're not coming
over here to gloat.

1:06:34.074 --> 1:06:36.700
I mean, although I didn't win,

1:06:37.160 --> 1:06:39.869
technically, I still beat you.

1:06:39.904 --> 1:06:43.957
What is that saying?
Second place
is the first loser.

1:06:43.959 --> 1:06:46.668
Whatever, mister,
you still owe me dinner.

1:06:46.670 --> 1:06:48.461
Got to go somewhere
to celebrate my win.

1:06:48.463 --> 1:06:50.213
Okay.

1:06:50.290 --> 1:06:52.132
-I got the perfect place.
-All right.

1:06:52.134 --> 1:06:53.091
Okay.

1:06:54.636 --> 1:06:55.719
Matter of fact,

1:06:56.263 --> 1:06:57.495
we can go now.

1:06:57.497 --> 1:06:59.973
It's crazy how I pass this way
all the time

1:06:59.975 --> 1:07:01.099
and I've never
stopped to do this.

1:07:01.101 --> 1:07:02.425
-Really?
-Never.

1:07:02.427 --> 1:07:04.436
-All right,
let me celebrate you.
-Okay.

1:07:04.471 --> 1:07:06.021
To <i> Bake Wars.</i>

1:07:06.097 --> 1:07:08.064
-Yes!
-And the second place, finish.

1:07:08.141 --> 1:07:09.691
You know what, way to ruin it.

1:07:10.777 --> 1:07:12.610
But this is the spot, right?
You like it?

1:07:12.612 --> 1:07:14.087
Yeah.

1:07:14.089 --> 1:07:16.448
And I know this isn't
champagne like I promised you,

1:07:16.450 --> 1:07:20.201
but beer goes way better
with Philly cheese steaks.

1:07:20.203 --> 1:07:22.111
So wait a minute,
let me get this straight.

1:07:22.113 --> 1:07:25.206
Cheesesteaks and beer
at an ice skating rink
is your favorite dinner.

1:07:25.917 --> 1:07:28.001
Yeah, I mean, come on.

1:07:28.003 --> 1:07:29.461
Look, we have
live entertainment

1:07:29.537 --> 1:07:31.588
with all the skaters
skating around.

1:07:31.590 --> 1:07:33.089
-[Brianna] Yeah.
-You never know
who's going to fall.

1:07:33.091 --> 1:07:35.258
[both laugh]

1:07:35.260 --> 1:07:38.553
And the best cheesesteaks
in the city.

1:07:38.630 --> 1:07:40.722
-We're going to just
see about that.
-Okay.

1:07:41.975 --> 1:07:43.767
Mmm, wow.

1:07:43.769 --> 1:07:45.685
-See? I told you.
-That's good.

1:07:45.687 --> 1:07:48.271
-It's amazing, right?
-Okay, that's good.

1:07:48.348 --> 1:07:49.981
We'll make a Philly girl
out of you yet.

1:07:50.058 --> 1:07:51.941
-We'll see about that.
-[chuckles]

1:07:53.278 --> 1:07:55.820
-I think it's about time
to see what you got.
-Ooh.

1:07:55.822 --> 1:07:58.615
Let's put this down
and let's join in the fun.

1:07:59.284 --> 1:08:00.784
Oh, my goodness.

1:08:00.786 --> 1:08:01.951
-Ready?
-All right.

1:08:02.028 --> 1:08:04.120
A one and a two and a...

1:08:04.197 --> 1:08:05.330
[both grunting]

1:08:05.332 --> 1:08:07.499
[laughs]

1:08:07.501 --> 1:08:09.417
All right.

1:08:09.419 --> 1:08:11.211
-[Brianna] Oh, my goodness.
-Ooh.

1:08:12.464 --> 1:08:13.922
[Brianna] Oh.

1:08:14.674 --> 1:08:18.384
What is up with Kandi Kakes
winning every competition?

1:08:18.428 --> 1:08:20.553
-Yeah, something tricky
about that.
-Something is going on.

1:08:20.555 --> 1:08:23.306
-[Brianna] Ooh.
-[Julian laughing]

1:08:23.383 --> 1:08:25.850
-[Brianna] You better
not laugh.
-I'm not laughing.

1:08:26.520 --> 1:08:30.230
-[screaming]
-[laughing]

1:08:31.983 --> 1:08:33.399
Oh, my God.

1:08:34.069 --> 1:08:35.110
I got you.

1:08:41.451 --> 1:08:42.826
Whoa.

1:08:43.912 --> 1:08:45.620
I thought we should head in.

1:08:45.697 --> 1:08:47.697
Yeah, yeah, we should, yeah.

1:08:52.796 --> 1:08:54.295
-[Julian] You did a great job.
-Look, I did better
than I thought I would.

1:08:55.382 --> 1:08:56.881
[Julian] That's the first time
I didn't fall.

1:08:56.958 --> 1:08:58.800
-Really?
-Yeah, I admit that.

1:08:58.802 --> 1:09:00.802
-Oh, my gosh.
-That was fun.

1:09:00.879 --> 1:09:02.720
-It was. It was.
-See, I told you.

1:09:02.722 --> 1:09:05.098
-Scary, but fun.
-But fun.

1:09:05.100 --> 1:09:08.351
Well, I have a second
favorite spot I want
to take you to next time.

1:09:08.353 --> 1:09:10.103
-Really?
-Yeah.

1:09:12.357 --> 1:09:14.056
-Here you are, Mom.
-Hey.

1:09:14.058 --> 1:09:15.483
-Hey.
-Daddy and I are waiting
for you to start game night.

1:09:15.560 --> 1:09:18.069
-Okay, all right.
-Oh, okay.

1:09:18.146 --> 1:09:19.696
[both clear throat awkwardly]

1:09:19.698 --> 1:09:21.990
-I really had a nice time.
-So did I.

1:09:22.066 --> 1:09:23.158
-Okay.
-Okay.

1:09:23.234 --> 1:09:25.034
Right, okay.

1:09:25.453 --> 1:09:26.661
[door closes]

1:09:27.914 --> 1:09:29.956
Like she had a sensor
or something.

1:09:30.500 --> 1:09:31.624
Wow.

1:09:35.839 --> 1:09:38.214
Hey, hey, hey, you f...

1:09:40.302 --> 1:09:42.427
[slow instrumental
music playing]

1:09:43.096 --> 1:09:44.512
Ah, do it again.

1:10:10.123 --> 1:10:11.331
[Damon] Morning.

1:10:11.333 --> 1:10:12.498
[Brianna] Morning.

1:10:13.335 --> 1:10:14.792
Anything under
the tree for me?

1:10:15.503 --> 1:10:17.170
Sure your daughter
got you something.

1:10:17.214 --> 1:10:19.214
Someone woke up
in a Scroogy mood.

1:10:19.374 --> 1:10:20.790
Must be nerves.

1:10:22.636 --> 1:10:24.219
Hey, you have to admit we made
a great team yesterday.

1:10:24.295 --> 1:10:26.095
Heh.

1:10:26.097 --> 1:10:29.224
Thanks for helping
to drive more customers,
but we are not a team.

1:10:31.144 --> 1:10:33.311
Where's Willow?

1:10:33.313 --> 1:10:37.023
Said she's getting her
new bike ready for its
inaugural ride to school.

1:10:38.151 --> 1:10:40.443
Just couldn't wait
for Christmas, huh?

1:10:40.445 --> 1:10:42.153
Can't a father
spoil his daughter?

1:10:42.155 --> 1:10:44.197
She doesn't need things,
Damon, she needs your time.

1:10:44.574 --> 1:10:46.115
I know.

1:10:46.192 --> 1:10:47.391
I'm going to do better.

1:10:50.622 --> 1:10:53.331
You know you're
an amazing woman, Brianna.

1:10:53.333 --> 1:10:55.750
I mean, look at
all you've done
to take care of our daughter.

1:10:55.752 --> 1:10:57.043
[Brianna] You left me
no choice.

1:10:58.546 --> 1:10:59.629
Bri.

1:11:00.674 --> 1:11:02.173
I want a second chance.

1:11:02.175 --> 1:11:03.716
Second chance at what, Damon?

1:11:04.177 --> 1:11:05.551
Second chance with us.

1:11:07.305 --> 1:11:08.554
No.

1:11:08.598 --> 1:11:10.098
It's over. Done.

1:11:11.226 --> 1:11:12.934
You shouldn't even
be staying here.

1:11:13.011 --> 1:11:14.852
Willow wanting me
to stay here.

1:11:14.854 --> 1:11:16.512
[Damon] Don't we owe her
another chance?

1:11:16.514 --> 1:11:19.190
[Brianna] Willow is
not a reason
for us to get together.

1:11:19.192 --> 1:11:21.150
She's the main reason
we need to stay apart.

1:11:21.736 --> 1:11:23.444
Brianna, how could you
say that?

1:11:23.446 --> 1:11:25.113
-You know, I love you.
-Okay.

1:11:28.868 --> 1:11:31.619
It took a while for me
to rebuild after you left.

1:11:33.206 --> 1:11:35.540
And I'm just getting
to a place where I'm okay.

1:11:38.461 --> 1:11:42.297
The only thing I need
from you is your half
of the tuition for Fallbrook.

1:11:44.175 --> 1:11:45.425
That's it.

1:11:46.386 --> 1:11:48.428
-It's like that?
-Yeah, it's like that.

1:11:51.266 --> 1:11:53.099
-Maybe I should just leave.
-Maybe you should.

1:12:02.193 --> 1:12:04.319
For our final challenge,

1:12:04.321 --> 1:12:06.946
our bakers must decorate
a holiday cake

1:12:06.990 --> 1:12:10.283
that represents
what Christmas means to them.

1:12:10.285 --> 1:12:11.993
They have one hour.

1:12:12.070 --> 1:12:14.329
Let the decorating begin.

1:12:21.087 --> 1:12:23.296
Oh. [groans]

1:12:23.340 --> 1:12:26.257
-You okay? Are you okay?
-Oh, Lord. Ooh.

1:12:26.259 --> 1:12:28.426
-What? What? Are you okay?
-[moans]

1:12:28.428 --> 1:12:29.969
Let me see. Oh, no, no, no.
Let me see, okay?

1:12:29.971 --> 1:12:31.512
-[moans]
-Okay, it'll be okay.

1:12:31.514 --> 1:12:32.764
Take your hand off,
take your hand off.

1:12:32.766 --> 1:12:34.223
Just take your hand off
for a second.

1:12:35.810 --> 1:12:37.101
Oh, yeah,
it's cut really deep.

1:12:37.136 --> 1:12:38.019
We got to get her
to a hospital.

1:12:38.096 --> 1:12:39.020
Should we call an ambulance?

1:12:39.097 --> 1:12:40.271
No, I don't think
we have time.

1:12:40.348 --> 1:12:41.430
We can take my motorcycle.

1:12:41.507 --> 1:12:43.274
We should take my car.
We can all go.

1:12:43.276 --> 1:12:45.068
Damon, you have to get
Willow after school.

1:12:45.070 --> 1:12:47.820
Brianna, if you leave,
you'll be disqualified.

1:12:47.864 --> 1:12:49.947
-Why?
-You can't disqualify her.
She needs medical attention.

1:12:49.949 --> 1:12:51.532
I can.

1:12:51.534 --> 1:12:54.911
And if you both leave,
Kandi Kakes wins
the competition.

1:12:54.913 --> 1:12:56.996
Well, then, congratulations
to Kandi Kakes.

1:12:56.998 --> 1:12:59.665
Julian, no,
you can stay and win this.

1:12:59.709 --> 1:13:02.210
Don't be silly,
it's just a competition.
Let's go.

1:13:04.422 --> 1:13:06.756
Felix, can't we just postpone
the final challenge?

1:13:06.758 --> 1:13:07.548
It's an emergency.

1:13:07.625 --> 1:13:08.958
No way.

1:13:08.960 --> 1:13:12.428
[loudly] If they leave,
they're both disqualified.

1:13:12.430 --> 1:13:14.722
And if you leave,
you're fired.

1:13:16.684 --> 1:13:18.309
You can't fire me.

1:13:20.230 --> 1:13:22.063
-I quit.
-[thuds]

1:13:22.065 --> 1:13:23.731
Oh, and by the way,

1:13:23.733 --> 1:13:26.526
they will sell tickets to my
exit interview with corporate.

1:13:37.288 --> 1:13:38.538
[sighs]

1:13:41.459 --> 1:13:43.292
-Hey.
-Mom.

1:13:45.088 --> 1:13:47.380
-Thanks for taking Brianna
to the hospital, man.
-Absolutely.

1:13:47.382 --> 1:13:48.840
-How is she?
-Mmm.

1:13:49.509 --> 1:13:51.426
-Hey, y'all.
-Hey.

1:13:52.512 --> 1:13:54.303
-[Brianna] Thank you.
-No problem.

1:13:54.305 --> 1:13:55.721
-Thanks, Layne.
-[Layne] Enjoy, enjoy.

1:13:56.641 --> 1:13:58.224
[Julian] Hey, cuz.

1:13:58.226 --> 1:14:00.560
Yeah, we were in and out.
No traffic.

1:14:00.562 --> 1:14:03.354
Bri, I'm glad the doctor was
able to see you so quickly.

1:14:03.356 --> 1:14:05.231
[Brianna] Yeah,
it would have sucked

1:14:05.233 --> 1:14:07.275
to have been stuck in
the hospital on Christmas Eve.

1:14:07.277 --> 1:14:08.860
-[Damon] Can I take a look?
-Yeah.

1:14:08.936 --> 1:14:11.320
-Oh, my goodness.
-Yeah.

1:14:11.322 --> 1:14:12.688
You'll still be able
to bake with that?

1:14:12.765 --> 1:14:14.824
Doctor said I should be good
in a few weeks, so...

1:14:14.826 --> 1:14:16.576
-[softly] I'm going to go.
-[Damon] Good.

1:14:16.578 --> 1:14:18.453
-[Damon] It hurt?
-[Brianna] Bad.

1:14:18.529 --> 1:14:20.455
Yeah, I could imagine,
it looked deep.

1:14:20.531 --> 1:14:21.497
[Brianna] Very.

1:14:21.833 --> 1:14:22.957
You okay, babe?

1:14:23.501 --> 1:14:24.850
I'll be just fine.

1:14:24.852 --> 1:14:27.879
I heard you and Dad
fighting earlier about me.

1:14:27.881 --> 1:14:30.214
Willow, honey, that doesn't
have anything to do with you.

1:14:30.216 --> 1:14:31.883
Your dad and I aren't
together anymore,

1:14:31.959 --> 1:14:34.010
but we still love you
very much.

1:14:34.086 --> 1:14:34.886
It's all my fault.

1:14:34.888 --> 1:14:36.637
No, no.

1:14:36.639 --> 1:14:38.639
The divorce
wasn't your fault, honey.

1:14:38.641 --> 1:14:40.558
Don't worry about
me and your moms.

1:14:40.560 --> 1:14:44.228
-We may fuss at each other
but we both love you so much.
-So much.

1:14:44.230 --> 1:14:45.730
-[door closes]
-And we'll always be family.

1:14:45.806 --> 1:14:47.130
Always.

1:14:48.276 --> 1:14:51.194
-Where's Julian?
-Oh, he had some place to be.

1:14:51.196 --> 1:14:52.987
I'm going to leave now, too.

1:14:53.064 --> 1:14:54.614
-[Brianna] Okay.
-I'll see you later?

1:14:54.616 --> 1:14:56.491
-[Brianna] All right.
-Bye.

1:14:56.567 --> 1:14:58.493
I didn't even get
to thank him properly.

1:14:59.370 --> 1:15:01.037
After the night we had,

1:15:01.039 --> 1:15:02.955
I think we could also
use a treat.

1:15:06.961 --> 1:15:09.295
[sighs]
Merry Christmas, Brianna.

1:15:10.215 --> 1:15:11.339
What?

1:15:13.593 --> 1:15:15.551
You didn't have to do this.

1:15:15.628 --> 1:15:16.761
[Damon] Yeah, I did.

1:15:18.056 --> 1:15:19.514
Oh, my gosh.

1:15:20.767 --> 1:15:22.934
It's more than enough
for the tuition for Fallbrook!

1:15:24.187 --> 1:15:25.686
Oh, my goodness.

1:15:25.939 --> 1:15:27.063
How?

1:15:27.139 --> 1:15:28.856
Called my booking agent
last night

1:15:28.858 --> 1:15:32.109
and had him wire me
an advance for
the second-half of the tour.

1:15:32.111 --> 1:15:34.153
Told him I wouldn't
head on the road next month
without it.

1:15:34.239 --> 1:15:35.947
Thanks, Dad.

1:15:35.949 --> 1:15:39.909
Thank you for being
an amazing mother
to our daughter.

1:15:39.911 --> 1:15:41.494
We're going to get this
co-parenting thing right.

1:15:42.747 --> 1:15:44.163
Yes, we are.

1:15:51.756 --> 1:15:54.507
Now, shouldn't you get going?

1:15:55.760 --> 1:15:57.635
What are you talking about?

1:15:57.637 --> 1:15:59.595
You need to go
thank your boyfriend, Julian.

1:15:59.597 --> 1:16:02.181
Julian is not my boyfriend.

1:16:02.225 --> 1:16:04.141
By the way he was
looking at you tonight

1:16:04.218 --> 1:16:05.643
and the fact that he
dropped out of

1:16:05.645 --> 1:16:09.480
a $50,000 baking competition
to help you,

1:16:09.557 --> 1:16:12.191
yeah, I'll say that man
got some feelings for you.

1:16:12.610 --> 1:16:13.818
I agree with Dad.

1:16:14.195 --> 1:16:16.153
Ah. Willow.

1:16:16.155 --> 1:16:18.698
I'll stay with Willow while
you go thank Julian properly.

1:16:19.534 --> 1:16:20.700
But first,

1:16:22.203 --> 1:16:24.036
-you might need this.
-Oh, my God.

1:16:26.916 --> 1:16:28.499
[chuckles]

1:16:29.586 --> 1:16:32.128
I don't even know
where he went tonight, so...

1:16:32.880 --> 1:16:35.339
Oh, I remember.

1:16:35.416 --> 1:16:39.051
He told me about watching
the stars at Nightingale Green
on Christmas Eve.

1:16:39.053 --> 1:16:40.595
Okay, no excuses now, Bri.

1:16:40.930 --> 1:16:42.054
[sighs]

1:16:42.974 --> 1:16:44.223
All right, well.

1:16:48.062 --> 1:16:49.729
Okay,

1:16:49.731 --> 1:16:51.314
I got to make one stop
but, um, love you all.

1:16:57.447 --> 1:16:58.696
Wow.

1:16:59.616 --> 1:17:01.032
Some weather, huh?

1:17:06.539 --> 1:17:08.039
-Hey.
-Hey.

1:17:09.375 --> 1:17:10.625
What are you doing here?

1:17:11.127 --> 1:17:12.418
Mind if I join you?

1:17:13.463 --> 1:17:14.611
No, I don't mind.

1:17:15.089 --> 1:17:16.964
I didn't know you were
into stargazing.

1:17:16.966 --> 1:17:19.425
Well, Willow said
I shouldn't miss it.

1:17:19.427 --> 1:17:22.053
Oh, Willow, I did tell her
I was coming today.

1:17:22.129 --> 1:17:23.712
[laughs]

1:17:23.714 --> 1:17:26.432
But, unfortunately,
the weather
didn't hold out so...

1:17:27.268 --> 1:17:29.310
Yeah. No stars.

1:17:30.229 --> 1:17:31.937
Now I see why you come here.

1:17:32.857 --> 1:17:34.899
-It's beautiful.
-It sure is.

1:17:38.863 --> 1:17:40.237
How's your finger?

1:17:40.239 --> 1:17:43.991
Um, messed up pretty bad.

1:17:44.068 --> 1:17:48.704
So how come you're not home
with Willow and Damon?

1:17:50.041 --> 1:17:53.209
Julian, there's nothing
going on between me and Damon.

1:17:53.285 --> 1:17:56.128
-Hmm.
-In fact, he's the reason
I'm here.

1:17:57.590 --> 1:18:01.425
I want to be here with you.

1:18:05.431 --> 1:18:07.306
And I'm wanted to give you
a Christmas gift.

1:18:07.850 --> 1:18:09.058
A Christmas gift?

1:18:11.062 --> 1:18:12.103
What is this?

1:18:12.355 --> 1:18:14.079
Open it.

1:18:14.982 --> 1:18:18.651
So I know you want to sell
Broussard pastries
outside of bakery.

1:18:18.695 --> 1:18:20.010
So to help you get started,

1:18:20.012 --> 1:18:22.571
I pitched your idea
of selling your desserts

1:18:22.573 --> 1:18:25.074
to the owner of
One City Republic supermarket,

1:18:25.076 --> 1:18:27.326
and she thinks
it's a wonderful idea.

1:18:27.328 --> 1:18:30.329
So she wants to talk to you
about supplying
all 10 locations

1:18:30.373 --> 1:18:31.706
with Broussard
branded desserts.

1:18:33.251 --> 1:18:35.418
[chuckles] Are you playing?

1:18:35.420 --> 1:18:38.295
I wouldn't play with nothing
as serious as desserts.

1:18:41.426 --> 1:18:43.426
-I don't know what to say.
-Julian, you deserve this.

1:18:44.262 --> 1:18:46.846
You gave up your opportunity
in the competition

1:18:46.848 --> 1:18:48.889
that would have helped
launch your business.

1:18:51.185 --> 1:18:54.103
No one's ever done anything
like this for me before.

1:18:57.525 --> 1:18:59.358
I have another gift for you.

1:18:59.360 --> 1:19:00.526
Another gift?

1:19:06.784 --> 1:19:08.325
Merry Christmas, Julian.

1:19:08.953 --> 1:19:11.036
Merry Christmas, Brianna.

1:19:28.639 --> 1:19:29.722
Come on.

1:19:36.814 --> 1:19:39.106
[Julian] What is this?

1:19:39.183 --> 1:19:43.527
Oh, it's just the cake that
would've won the competition.

1:19:43.529 --> 1:19:47.615
How is this the cake that
would've won the competition

1:19:47.617 --> 1:19:49.200
-if it's not my cake?
-[scoffs]

1:19:49.744 --> 1:19:51.577
[laughs]

1:19:51.579 --> 1:19:53.370
It's beautiful, though.

1:19:53.372 --> 1:19:56.081
But tell me,
what makes it special?

1:19:56.125 --> 1:19:59.168
Well, I've always associated
baking with family,

1:19:59.245 --> 1:20:02.254
and the connection I felt
growing up,

1:20:02.256 --> 1:20:06.091
cooking with my grandmother
and then Willow and now Sabon.

1:20:06.135 --> 1:20:07.051
Uh-huh.

1:20:08.054 --> 1:20:09.628
Wait a minute.

1:20:09.630 --> 1:20:12.389
-Is this the white chocolate
opera cake?
-It is.

1:20:12.391 --> 1:20:14.683
-Mmm.
-I'm branching out.

1:20:14.685 --> 1:20:17.269
I found one of your
mother's recipes online.

1:20:17.313 --> 1:20:19.129
You know,
put my little kick to it,

1:20:19.131 --> 1:20:22.316
switched up the ingredients,
made it vegan,
and it is delicious.

1:20:22.318 --> 1:20:25.027
-Uh-huh.
-[Sophie] I'll be
the judge of that.

1:20:25.655 --> 1:20:28.030
Mmm. [laughs]

1:20:37.124 --> 1:20:38.833
-Light.
-Mmm-hmm.

1:20:38.835 --> 1:20:40.251
-Rich.
-What?

1:20:40.253 --> 1:20:42.002
We need to sell this
at the bakery.

1:20:42.004 --> 1:20:43.820
Seriously?

1:20:43.822 --> 1:20:46.257
Julian, you need to add
some vegan options
to your business plan.

1:20:46.333 --> 1:20:48.342
-[doorbell ringing]
-Are you feeling well?

1:20:49.053 --> 1:20:50.553
Okay.

1:20:50.555 --> 1:20:53.764
I mean, Brianna's cakes
and our bourbon dessert trio,

1:20:53.766 --> 1:20:57.643
sounds like the beginning
of a very tasty partnership.

1:20:57.687 --> 1:21:00.604
Oh, uh,
sorry to interrupt, um.

1:21:00.681 --> 1:21:02.731
It's good to see
you two together.

1:21:02.733 --> 1:21:04.775
I guess I should have
seen that coming.

1:21:05.486 --> 1:21:07.069
Well, it's good that
you guys are both here,

1:21:07.146 --> 1:21:08.946
it saves me a trip from going
to your house, Brianna.

1:21:09.240 --> 1:21:10.906
What's going on?

1:21:10.908 --> 1:21:13.450
Well, the network fired Felix.

1:21:14.453 --> 1:21:15.870
Thank God.

1:21:15.872 --> 1:21:18.622
Yeah, someone
pretty influential
called the network

1:21:18.699 --> 1:21:22.293
and blasted Felix for the way
he reacted when you
had to go to the hospital.

1:21:22.295 --> 1:21:23.419
Who would have done that?

1:21:23.880 --> 1:21:26.505
Mom, you didn't.

1:21:27.466 --> 1:21:29.884
-You did?
-I can't believe it.

1:21:29.886 --> 1:21:32.052
[Sophie] <i> C'est la vie.</i>

1:21:32.129 --> 1:21:35.681
I never forget a face
and I never forget
a pedestrian quiche.

1:21:35.683 --> 1:21:37.099
Felix had it coming.

1:21:37.176 --> 1:21:39.685
-[doorbell rings]
-Your mom's a pastry gangster.

1:21:39.687 --> 1:21:41.470
Mmm-hmm, French connection.

1:21:41.472 --> 1:21:44.106
I also informed the network
that Kandi was using
store bought...

1:21:44.108 --> 1:21:46.025
-Hi. Come on in.
-[Cricket] ...cakes
and cookies

1:21:46.027 --> 1:21:47.484
for the competition
and that Felix knew.

1:21:47.561 --> 1:21:48.485
Take a look.

1:21:48.562 --> 1:21:49.695
Yeah.

1:21:52.909 --> 1:21:54.533
[Brianna and Julian chuckle]

1:21:54.535 --> 1:21:55.951
-[Julian] We said that.
-[Brianna] I know.

1:21:56.579 --> 1:21:57.828
Kandi Kakes.

1:21:59.165 --> 1:22:02.458
Oh, so Damon's here
to drop Willow off.

1:22:02.534 --> 1:22:04.209
No, no, invite them in.

1:22:04.211 --> 1:22:07.004
-I mean, it's Christmas.
-Come in.

1:22:07.006 --> 1:22:09.506
So if Kandi Kakes is out
and Felix got fired,

1:22:10.134 --> 1:22:11.800
what happens next?

1:22:11.802 --> 1:22:14.595
Well, that's
the best news of all.

1:22:14.672 --> 1:22:18.349
The network said that
you two are a huge hit
with social media fans

1:22:18.425 --> 1:22:20.976
and they want you
to co-host a show together.

1:22:20.978 --> 1:22:23.812
-What?
-[all exclaiming and cheering]

1:22:23.889 --> 1:22:27.024
And I will be
the executive producer.

1:22:27.735 --> 1:22:30.653
Oh, I don't know what to say.

1:22:30.655 --> 1:22:33.113
Say yes, dear.

1:22:33.115 --> 1:22:35.699
Do you really think we can
host a TV show together?

1:22:35.910 --> 1:22:37.660
I don't know.

1:22:37.662 --> 1:22:39.536
But I know we're going
to have fun figuring it out.

1:22:39.538 --> 1:22:40.704
Come on.

1:22:42.458 --> 1:22:44.041
As long as you know
who's boss.

1:22:44.627 --> 1:22:46.543
Yeah. Me.

1:22:47.254 --> 1:22:48.671
[all] Ooh.

1:22:48.673 --> 1:22:50.798
[all laughing]

1:22:54.178 --> 1:22:56.053
Come on, guys,
let's go over to the tree.

1:22:57.515 --> 1:22:58.639
[Brianna] What did you get me?

1:22:58.641 --> 1:23:00.724
[indistinct conversations]

1:23:01.936 --> 1:23:03.060
Come on.

1:23:03.521 --> 1:23:04.937
Merry Christmas, Mom.

1:23:04.981 --> 1:23:06.522
Oh, my goodness.

1:23:09.860 --> 1:23:10.776
This is for you two.

1:23:11.195 --> 1:23:12.277
Oh, thank you.
