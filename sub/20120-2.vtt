00:01.480 --> 00:05.480
There are likely no Titans
among the 104th Cadet Corps recruits!

00:06.440 --> 00:08.770
Multiple Titans from the south!

00:09.900 --> 00:12.360
Wall Rose has been breached!

00:17.700 --> 00:20.707
The 104th Cadet Corps
were kept isolated

00:20.732 --> 00:24.104
under suspicion of Titans
within their ranks.

00:25.540 --> 00:28.480
But with the sudden
appearance of Titans,

00:28.505 --> 00:31.864
couriers were dispatched
to warn each district.

00:35.510 --> 00:36.839
As you may know,

00:36.840 --> 00:40.100
today marks the new darkest day
in humanity's history!

00:40.470 --> 00:45.580
If ever humankind needed
to give its all, that time is now!

00:46.520 --> 00:47.560
However...

00:52.780 --> 00:53.989
What?!

00:53.990 --> 00:55.240
They all started sprinting!

00:58.200 --> 01:01.990
The cause of this crisis
remains in the dark.

01:02.660 --> 01:04.870
For now, no one yet knows.

01:12.960 --> 01:17.060
I must say, what a clever idea.

03:01.780 --> 03:04.699
"Trost District"

03:04.700 --> 03:05.700
Commander Pyxis!

03:06.990 --> 03:08.290
Titans have been spotted!

03:09.080 --> 03:12.210
Wall Rose has been breached!

03:13.630 --> 03:14.570
Hmm.

03:15.230 --> 03:19.080
"Stohess District"

03:20.510 --> 03:24.509
What the hell does all this mean?

03:24.510 --> 03:25.800
Damn it!

03:26.350 --> 03:27.470
But...

03:29.060 --> 03:32.450
Would Titans break walls
with Titans in them?

03:33.270 --> 03:37.649
It's happened before.
They busted the wall into our city.

03:37.650 --> 03:39.110
That was a gate.

03:41.360 --> 03:43.770
Armin? What are you saying?

03:44.410 --> 03:45.620
The thing about the walls...

03:46.490 --> 03:51.079
There's no crevices between the rocks
or any signs of cracking.

03:51.080 --> 03:53.710
We can't really tell how they're made.

03:56.090 --> 03:59.170
So what if they're made
of hardened Titan skin?

04:01.840 --> 04:05.810
It must be pretty versatile
if Annie can encase herself.

04:08.260 --> 04:11.180
Titans... in the wall...

04:12.600 --> 04:14.820
Section Commander! What are you doing?

04:15.440 --> 04:17.728
We're supposed to leave in 5 minutes!

04:17.730 --> 04:18.819
Please hurry up!

04:18.820 --> 04:21.190
There's something I need to confirm...

04:25.030 --> 04:25.890
Hey.

04:26.700 --> 04:27.739
Get moving.

04:27.740 --> 04:29.200
Ah, sorry!

04:29.450 --> 04:30.579
What about him?

04:30.580 --> 04:32.630
He's been ready for a while now.

04:41.510 --> 04:43.549
Eren. Wear it right.

04:43.550 --> 04:44.640
It's cold at night.

04:45.340 --> 04:46.630
Sorry to keep ya!

04:47.530 --> 04:50.560
Took longer to prepare than we thought.

04:55.980 --> 04:56.900
Um...

04:57.520 --> 05:00.150
Isn't this a priest from
the Order of the Walls?

05:00.610 --> 05:03.609
Yeah. Nick and I are best buddies.

05:03.610 --> 05:04.880
Right?

05:05.360 --> 05:07.110
Don't let him bother you.

05:07.570 --> 05:11.159
The whole makeup of this squad
doesn't make any sense.

05:11.160 --> 05:12.640
Does it, Levi?

05:13.160 --> 05:14.750
No, I think it might.

05:15.750 --> 05:18.270
Erwin picked them out for a reason.

05:18.920 --> 05:20.250
Open the gate!

05:29.140 --> 05:31.600
The situation within Wall Rose is unclear.

05:32.010 --> 05:34.110
But everything up until Ehrmich is safe.

05:34.640 --> 05:36.310
We'll save time going through there.

05:36.890 --> 05:37.730
Move out!

05:37.980 --> 05:39.150
Yes, sir!

05:40.770 --> 05:41.770
Take us out.

05:41.770 --> 05:42.570
Yes, sir!

05:57.750 --> 06:02.770
This whole time, Titans have been
protecting us from Titans.

06:14.520 --> 06:16.270
Huh? He knew?

06:16.810 --> 06:20.480
There's Titans inside the walls
and he's known about it?!

06:21.060 --> 06:22.830
Yes, though...

06:23.480 --> 06:26.240
...he's kept his mouth
shut this entire time.

06:28.530 --> 06:33.199
But now he's coming with us
to witness the harsh reality.

06:33.200 --> 06:36.390
Will his beliefs be strong enough
for him to stay silent?

06:37.040 --> 06:40.770
Or will seeing it with his own eyes
make him question himself?

06:41.830 --> 06:45.169
No, no, no, no! This is all backwards!

06:45.170 --> 06:47.970
If there's something you
know, tell us about it!

06:48.260 --> 06:52.799
Nothing's more important than
keeping humans from going extinct!

06:52.800 --> 06:55.429
Eren, settle down.

06:55.430 --> 06:57.290
You're still not fully healed.

06:58.560 --> 07:01.000
There's more than one way to get answers.

07:02.060 --> 07:07.820
I may be injured and useless right now,
but it doesn't take much to watch one man.

07:08.190 --> 07:12.840
I'm hoping we can settle this
without blasting a hole in anyone.

07:13.450 --> 07:14.659
Aren't you?

07:14.660 --> 07:16.909
Threatening him doesn't work, Levi.

07:16.910 --> 07:18.350
Believe me, I've tried.

07:18.830 --> 07:23.300
It seems to me that this priest
is capable of sound judgment.

07:24.290 --> 07:25.910
That's why I wonder...

07:26.630 --> 07:28.839
What if the reason he doesn't talk

07:28.840 --> 07:32.910
is because he knows something more
important than the fate of humanity?

07:36.430 --> 07:38.469
See that? It's the village!

07:38.470 --> 07:39.809
Is that the last one?

07:39.810 --> 07:43.600
No! My village is deep in the forest!

07:44.860 --> 07:46.979
I'll go there alone!

07:46.980 --> 07:48.359
All right!

07:48.360 --> 07:50.279
Leave this village to me!

07:50.280 --> 07:51.260
Got it!

07:58.240 --> 08:00.829
Hey! Quit it, Sasha!

08:00.830 --> 08:04.250
Sasha! You been nabbing snacks again?!

08:04.670 --> 08:06.289
Stop! Spit it out!

08:06.290 --> 08:07.749
Get it out of yer mouth!

08:07.750 --> 08:11.470
We fixin' to smoke
that for winter, ya moron!

08:21.390 --> 08:23.690
You damn dumb girl!

08:24.270 --> 08:24.980
Fine!

08:26.020 --> 08:27.260
Have it yer way.

08:29.320 --> 08:30.730
Dagnabbit.

08:40.490 --> 08:41.350
Sasha.

08:41.870 --> 08:46.600
Have you asked yerself
why the world is a-changing?

08:47.420 --> 08:51.590
Why these past few years the forest
be shrinkin' and game harder to find?

08:52.170 --> 08:53.720
Have you ever thunk about it?

08:55.880 --> 09:00.350
It's 'cause more people be comin' and
taking food and game from the forest.

09:00.760 --> 09:02.270
That's why I'm hungry.

09:03.480 --> 09:04.930
That's true.

09:06.060 --> 09:06.990
But, hey...

09:07.560 --> 09:12.700
They lost their homes and got no place
to go. They got no other choice.

09:13.190 --> 09:15.199
Their fault for losing it.

09:15.200 --> 09:16.780
They oughta leave ours.

09:18.700 --> 09:20.529
Titans took it from 'em.

09:20.530 --> 09:25.250
They knocked a hole straight through Wall
Maria. Where else can they go?

09:26.790 --> 09:33.280
You can feed a hell of a lot more people
by clearin' the forest and plantin' grain.

09:36.340 --> 09:41.760
Maybe it's time for our family to let go
of the forest and give up huntin' for good.

09:43.390 --> 09:44.849
The government said they would pay us.

09:44.850 --> 09:49.059
Every horse that we raise
is money in our pockets.

09:49.060 --> 09:50.809
You gotta be kidding!

09:50.810 --> 09:53.779
If we give up huntin',
we be givin' up who we are!

09:53.780 --> 09:57.909
Why should we give a hoot about
the people who make fun of our lifestyle?

09:57.910 --> 09:59.450
I'll tell ya why.

10:01.200 --> 10:04.670
It's because... we're all
part of the same world.

10:05.890 --> 10:09.830
We humans... We've always
been pack animals.

10:10.170 --> 10:13.049
Sure, we all live our different ways.

10:13.050 --> 10:18.509
But when space is this short, we gotta
join the group and do what's best to...

10:18.510 --> 10:20.639
No! I refuse!

10:20.640 --> 10:24.850
We've lived here all our lives,
just like the way our ancestors taught us!

10:25.100 --> 10:27.690
We don't owe nothing to any outsiders!

10:32.610 --> 10:34.189
I see...

10:34.190 --> 10:35.740
So be it.

10:38.150 --> 10:43.900
Ya can live here in this forest,
along with the others who think the same.

10:45.450 --> 10:46.730
But, Sasha...

10:47.450 --> 10:50.140
Are ya willin' to die for that choice?

10:51.670 --> 10:56.030
No matter what trouble comes yer way,
ya can't go beggin' for help.

10:56.630 --> 11:02.170
If you're not there for them,
don't expect them to be there for you.

11:03.800 --> 11:09.139
I'm willin' to give up our traditions
if it means I can live with my family.

11:09.140 --> 11:13.010
Goes to show ya our world's connected,
whether you like it or not.

11:15.110 --> 11:19.110
Sasha. Are you that much of a scaredy-cat?

11:20.200 --> 11:26.530
Is it that hard for you to leave this
forest behind and get along with others?

11:30.870 --> 11:33.130
It's been 3 years since I've been back.

11:33.670 --> 11:36.560
Surely he realized something
was amiss and fled...

11:41.090 --> 11:43.920
It can't be! Way out here?

11:46.930 --> 11:49.650
They've already come this far?!

11:51.480 --> 11:55.030
This place isn't safe for people anymore.

11:59.360 --> 12:03.030
What's that? A new village?

13:23.780 --> 13:27.570
Damn! If I don't slice it off,
it'll just heal back up!

13:36.830 --> 13:37.860
A child?

13:46.930 --> 13:48.550
I'm so sorry...

14:03.780 --> 14:05.280
What's your name?

14:08.860 --> 14:10.989
Don't worry. It'll be okay.

14:10.990 --> 14:11.910
What will?

14:11.911 --> 14:15.160
Huh? What? I mean... Um...

14:16.290 --> 14:18.419
Steady... Steady...

14:18.420 --> 14:20.170
Um, you see...

14:20.560 --> 14:20.920
Huh?

14:22.710 --> 14:24.549
You're kidding me! Hey!

14:24.550 --> 14:26.520
Please wait for us!

14:29.130 --> 14:30.799
There's no need to worry.

14:30.800 --> 14:32.809
Please stay calm. It'll come right back.

14:32.810 --> 14:34.769
Why are you so nice when you talk?

14:34.770 --> 14:35.820
What?

14:45.190 --> 14:46.360
Run away from here!

14:49.860 --> 14:51.060
It'll be okay!

14:52.530 --> 14:54.950
Why? Everyone already left.

14:56.290 --> 14:59.710
The whole village knew
my mother's legs were bad.

15:00.620 --> 15:03.629
But not a single person came to help.

15:03.630 --> 15:05.750
All I could do was watch.

15:25.070 --> 15:26.400
It'll be okay!

15:30.110 --> 15:30.900
It's okay.

15:34.660 --> 15:36.629
You're really starting to tick me off.

15:36.630 --> 15:37.450
What?

15:38.120 --> 15:41.040
That stupid way you talk
politely to everyone.

15:42.750 --> 15:45.230
Why don't you talk to
other cadets like normal?

15:45.710 --> 15:48.210
Um... Well, you see...

15:50.010 --> 15:52.219
Wait. Let me guess.

15:52.220 --> 15:56.059
You're embarrassed by the way
people sound from your village.

15:56.060 --> 15:57.099
Bull's-eye?

15:57.100 --> 16:00.809
I'm surprised an idiot
like you cares so much.

16:00.810 --> 16:05.360
You can't do anything but hunt,
and you're afraid of people, to top it off.

16:06.900 --> 16:10.360
I bet you don't have a single good reason
for aiming to become a soldier.

16:10.860 --> 16:12.109
Your parents probably...

16:12.110 --> 16:13.359
Stop it, Ymir! You're being...

16:13.360 --> 16:14.529
Sasha!

16:14.530 --> 16:18.580
You gonna care what other people think
and be someone you're not your whole life?

16:18.870 --> 16:20.749
What a crock of shit.

16:20.750 --> 16:24.870
You're fine as is, so talk in
your own words for crying out loud.

16:27.090 --> 16:29.510
Th-Thank you...

16:30.460 --> 16:31.969
...very much.

16:31.970 --> 16:33.339
What?

16:33.340 --> 16:34.839
I'm... sorry.

16:34.840 --> 16:36.389
I'm not... yet...

16:36.390 --> 16:37.810
Cut it out!

16:38.390 --> 16:42.060
There's nothing wrong
with the way she talks!

16:43.520 --> 16:46.059
Sasha is who Sasha wants to be.

16:46.060 --> 16:48.400
Her words will always be her own.

16:48.860 --> 16:50.580
And I happen to like her.

16:51.610 --> 16:53.900
Hmph! Have it your way.

16:54.410 --> 16:57.189
Still, even if she changed
the way she talks,

16:57.190 --> 16:59.449
it won't change the fact
that she's annoying.

16:59.450 --> 17:03.369
You know, not everyone
is as insensitive as you.

17:03.370 --> 17:04.959
Excuse me?

17:04.960 --> 17:07.710
You little... You little...

17:08.920 --> 17:11.959
Hey! What are you laughing at?!

17:11.960 --> 17:14.510
Ah! I'm sorry!

17:20.760 --> 17:24.059
Why do I remember, now of all times...

17:24.060 --> 17:26.730
...about silly, pointless days in the past?

17:27.099 --> 17:30.730
It's all... I can think of.

17:33.150 --> 17:34.500
Hey, listen up.

17:36.030 --> 17:38.900
You'll be fine. Keep following this path.

17:39.450 --> 17:40.990
Run as far as you can.

17:41.540 --> 17:44.749
I promise someone will be
there to help you.

17:44.750 --> 17:47.459
You might not find them right away...

17:47.460 --> 17:50.000
But still, keep running until you do!

17:51.000 --> 17:52.130
Now, go!

17:52.710 --> 17:53.510
Run!

17:57.760 --> 17:59.720
Get runnin'!

18:15.740 --> 18:18.780
If I take out both eyes,
it'll buy us plenty of time.

18:25.750 --> 18:27.790
Only... two left.

18:29.120 --> 18:30.459
Relax...

18:30.460 --> 18:33.420
All it is... is a big...

18:33.590 --> 18:34.550
...slow moving...

18:34.760 --> 18:35.920
...target!

18:39.090 --> 18:40.090
Got it!

18:43.970 --> 18:45.679
One more arrow.

18:45.680 --> 18:48.550
But, if I miss this...

18:52.110 --> 18:54.069
...we can't escape.

18:54.070 --> 18:56.780
If I miss, me and...

18:57.570 --> 18:58.650
...that girl...

19:26.810 --> 19:28.650
I slipped out thanks to that blood.

19:29.560 --> 19:30.850
Now I've gotta find that girl!

19:37.150 --> 19:39.450
Huh? Sasha?

19:58.170 --> 20:02.129
We been givin' horses
to everyone in the area.

20:02.130 --> 20:05.100
That girl told us someone
was still back there.

20:06.350 --> 20:08.850
Who'da thunk it was you?

20:09.850 --> 20:12.890
You fought off a Titan
for that girl, didn't ya?

20:15.860 --> 20:18.110
Sasha... Yer all I hoped for.

20:20.820 --> 20:22.040
Father...

20:24.700 --> 20:26.200
I'm home.

20:30.120 --> 20:31.460
Conny, wait!

20:32.210 --> 20:33.579

20:33.580 --> 20:35.560
There could be Titans anywhere!

20:36.170 --> 20:37.770
Get back here, Conny!

20:41.340 --> 20:42.170
This can't be...

20:47.470 --> 20:50.680
Anyone?! Is anyone there?!

20:52.430 --> 20:54.559
It's me! Conny!

20:54.560 --> 20:56.740
I came back!

21:06.000 --> 21:06.780
My house!

21:11.000 --> 21:11.990
Dad...

21:12.870 --> 21:14.209
Mom...

21:14.210 --> 21:16.750
Sunny... Martin!

21:17.250 --> 21:19.200
Please be okay!

21:35.270 --> 21:37.370
Conny! Get back!

21:37.980 --> 21:40.420
It's... my house.

21:41.360 --> 21:42.250
My...

21:42.940 --> 21:43.990
Conny...

21:44.650 --> 21:45.780

21:46.320 --> 21:48.030

21:50.870 --> 21:52.830
Wait, it's...

21:53.370 --> 21:54.749

21:54.750 --> 21:56.290
Not with those legs...

21:58.170 --> 22:01.430
Th-Then... How?

22:02.170 --> 22:04.100
How did it even get here?!

23:41.350 --> 23:43.630
"I'm sure my family is safe and sound."

23:44.440 --> 23:48.280
Shaking off the dread of Titans
appearing in his hometown,

23:48.780 --> 23:50.990
Conny once again departs.

23:51.780 --> 23:56.640
Battle erupts across the land
while the mystery of the Titans remains.

23:57.490 --> 23:59.999
