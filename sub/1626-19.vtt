10:25.826 --> 10:28.193
It'll be $5 to take
a selfie with the leprechaun.

10:28.195 --> 10:31.029
That is a great deal.

10:31.031 --> 10:33.365
Max, I am not doing this.

10:33.367 --> 10:37.335
Fine. Then we'll have to use the
cupcake money for our cab home.

10:37.337 --> 10:39.871
Okay, that there
is virgin leprechaun.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.673
So it's $10.

10:41.675 --> 10:44.676
10 for a picture, 15 for a kiss,
nothing below the waist.

10:44.678 --> 10:47.512
That's 'cause there's
nothing below the waist.

10:47.514 --> 10:49.614
Will you take a 20?

10:49.616 --> 10:53.418
I mean, I guess.

10:55.554 --> 10:59.357
Just so you know, if you're
an orphan, I'm interested.

11:01.293 --> 11:03.495
Are you over here
making money off of me,

11:03.497 --> 11:05.296
You wolves of wall street?

11:05.298 --> 11:08.166
We're just taking advantage
of drunk people.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.768
It's a st. Paddy's tradition,

11:09.770 --> 11:12.337
Like corned beef
or punching a cop.

11:12.339 --> 11:16.374
Well, then maybe you can get
them to take advantage of me.

11:16.376 --> 11:19.711
Get a little handsy
on hansy.

11:19.713 --> 11:22.881
I've got my eye
on that buxom paralegal.

11:22.883 --> 11:26.951
The one over there who
brought in outside chicken?

11:29.455 --> 11:30.955
Hook daddy up!

11:30.957 --> 11:32.824
So I'm going up to the woman

11:32.826 --> 11:37.062
Who brought her own
two-liter of coke to a bar

11:37.064 --> 11:40.532
To ask her for money
to touch you.

11:40.534 --> 11:43.668
That's the gist.

11:43.670 --> 11:46.171
What's happened
to my life? Where am I?

11:46.173 --> 11:48.473
Blarney's!

11:48.475 --> 11:49.674
Oh, god, it's blarney bill.

11:49.676 --> 11:50.975
Hey, that's my name!

11:50.977 --> 11:52.477
Where's me kiss?

11:52.479 --> 11:55.346
Oh, well, I--

11:55.348 --> 11:56.981
I have to go to the ladies' room

11:56.983 --> 11:58.817
And wash whatever
is on my mouth and in my mouth

11:58.819 --> 12:00.785
Off my mouth
and out of my mouth.

12:04.156 --> 12:06.791
We've been in this line so long,
now I actually have to pee.

12:06.793 --> 12:10.729
Max, are you eating chicken?

12:10.731 --> 12:12.664
She didn't have
10 bucks to tickle han,

12:12.666 --> 12:15.800
So she paid me
in purse chicken.

12:15.802 --> 12:19.270
I think I came out ahead.

12:19.272 --> 12:21.940
Uh, sorry, back of the line.
No cuts.

12:21.942 --> 12:23.908
Please. I'm feeling sick.

12:23.910 --> 12:27.512
Sorry, no cuts,
no buts, no coconuts.

12:27.514 --> 12:30.615
Is that one of those
famous irish poems too?

12:30.617 --> 12:33.151
I totally understand.
Yeah, I get it.

12:33.153 --> 12:34.452
Just let her cut.
It's st. Patrick's day.

12:34.454 --> 12:36.354
She's having fun.

12:36.356 --> 12:39.257
Not to bring up my st. Patrick's
day tradition at the plaza...

12:39.259 --> 12:40.759
Oh, good.

12:40.761 --> 12:43.194
But it was so much better
than this place.

12:43.196 --> 12:45.196
I mean, there were no lines.

12:45.198 --> 12:48.767
We'd sit like non-animals in
the palm court and sip bellinis.

12:48.769 --> 12:50.268
I'm taking you to palm court

12:50.270 --> 12:52.804
If you tell that story
one more time.

12:52.806 --> 12:54.606
Guys.

12:54.608 --> 12:57.675
I just threw up.

13:01.947 --> 13:06.217
And you're carrying it around
like a baby chick?

13:06.219 --> 13:08.453
I-I think I'm gonna
need some water.

13:08.455 --> 13:12.023
I have to drive
a school bus in four hours.

13:13.926 --> 13:16.394
You're a great american.

13:16.396 --> 13:18.963
I know what I am.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.031
<i>(blarney bill)</i>
<i>ahem!</i>

13:20.033 --> 13:21.266
Oh!

13:21.268 --> 13:23.034
Where's me kiss?

13:23.036 --> 13:24.869
Uh, she has it.

13:24.871 --> 13:25.937
Ah!

13:25.939 --> 13:27.238
[smooches]

13:27.240 --> 13:28.540
Dodged a bullet.

13:36.982 --> 13:40.151
Bullet found ya.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.259
Come on. I have to find
another bathroom.

13:48.261 --> 13:50.128
I'm not peeing
anywhere near blarney bill.

13:50.130 --> 13:53.631
I don't want him to find "me
kiss" when I have me pants down.

13:55.467 --> 13:57.702
I gave him your number.
Is that cool?

13:57.704 --> 14:00.905
Oh, no. I don't think
I'm gonna make it.

14:00.907 --> 14:03.675
You mean in life?
Yeah, me neither.

14:03.677 --> 14:06.311
No, it's all that
green beer.

14:06.313 --> 14:09.080
And if I wet myself
here on 53rd street,

14:09.082 --> 14:11.149
I'll be forced to abandon you,
move to the midwest,

14:11.151 --> 14:12.750
And start a new life.

14:12.752 --> 14:16.988
I have a bathroom
you can use.

14:19.225 --> 14:21.759
I've hit some very
low points today,

14:21.761 --> 14:25.096
But I'm not about to pee
through a paper penis in public.

14:25.098 --> 14:28.333
Here, quick, just pop a squat
over here behind the float,

14:28.335 --> 14:30.001
I'll block you
so no one'll see,

14:30.003 --> 14:31.736
And the 15 high school
marching bands'll

14:31.738 --> 14:34.172
Mask the sound of you
hitting rock bottom.

14:34.174 --> 14:36.608
Gimme that thing.

14:36.610 --> 14:37.842
Damn it, max. Damn it!

14:37.844 --> 14:39.677
How do I do this?

14:39.679 --> 14:43.715
Well, I do have my master's
in public urination from devry.

14:43.717 --> 14:45.450
Just unzip,
put it in your pants,

14:45.452 --> 14:47.051
And let a river run through it.

14:47.053 --> 14:48.586
No one's looking, right?

14:48.588 --> 14:49.954
Nope.

14:49.956 --> 14:52.657
[engine starts]

14:55.427 --> 14:57.695
Hi, caroline.

15:00.099 --> 15:03.768
Sophie, you were
in the parade?

15:03.770 --> 15:05.370
Of course I was.

15:05.372 --> 15:07.138
You can't be
a volunteer firefighter

15:07.140 --> 15:09.107
Without being in the parade.

15:09.109 --> 15:11.542
You're a volunteer
firefighter?

15:11.544 --> 15:16.281
Well, I do go down
to the station voluntarily.

15:16.283 --> 15:19.017
Besides, every
fire station needs a pole,

15:19.019 --> 15:21.152
And I'm it, baby.

15:21.154 --> 15:23.788
Anyway, we're all
going to blarney's.

15:23.790 --> 15:25.189
Shots on me.

15:25.191 --> 15:28.826
And by that
I mean shots <i>on</i> me.

15:28.828 --> 15:30.995
[all cheering]

15:30.997 --> 15:33.064
Come on.

15:33.066 --> 15:35.300
When the firemen's pole
offers you drinks, you say yes.

15:35.302 --> 15:37.635
Max, I am not
going back in there.

15:37.637 --> 15:40.471
In fact, I'm treating you
to a drink at the plaza.

15:40.473 --> 15:42.540
You know that money we were
saving for our funeral?

15:42.542 --> 15:46.411
That's no longer an issue
because I just died right then.

15:46.413 --> 15:49.414
Rest in pee, caroline.

15:56.155 --> 15:58.122
Look, max, our bellinis.

15:58.124 --> 16:00.224
Thank you, claude.

16:00.226 --> 16:03.127
He's a plaza institution.

16:03.129 --> 16:06.164
And I just remembered
his name is rolph.

16:06.166 --> 16:07.999
You forgot the name rolph

16:08.001 --> 16:10.935
After we just saw
a girl do that in her hands?

16:10.937 --> 16:12.303
Isn't it lovely here?

16:12.305 --> 16:15.239
Less blarney's,
more barney's.

16:15.241 --> 16:17.308
And trust me,
these bellinis are famous.

16:17.310 --> 16:20.678
Why?
Did they make a sex tape?

16:20.680 --> 16:22.513
Ooh, kind of
tastes like the time

16:22.515 --> 16:25.350
I put canned peaches
in my boxed wine.

16:25.352 --> 16:29.487
Max, a plaza bellini
is a far cry from boxed wine.

16:29.489 --> 16:33.825
Well, my rule is, if I have
to refrigerate it, it's fancy.

16:33.827 --> 16:37.528
I'm talkin' to you, batteries.

16:39.264 --> 16:41.099
You know, tonight
is really bringing up

16:41.101 --> 16:42.600
How much I miss the old me.

16:42.602 --> 16:44.535
Yeah, tonight
is really bringing up

16:44.537 --> 16:46.604
How much I miss
my friend archie.

16:46.606 --> 16:48.006
Who?

16:48.008 --> 16:50.108
The guy you hit
with the champagne balloons.

16:50.110 --> 16:52.377
Sells car seat covers
in rhode island.

16:52.379 --> 16:54.579
You know how I said
he was doing really well?

16:54.581 --> 16:56.514
Truth is I haven't talked
to him in a year.

16:56.516 --> 17:00.385
Really dropped the ball.

17:00.387 --> 17:02.787
And the most exciting thing
about this place--

17:02.789 --> 17:04.722
Those elevator doors
can open,

17:04.724 --> 17:06.791
And you never know
who's gonna step off.

17:06.793 --> 17:07.792
[elevator dings]

17:07.794 --> 17:10.828
[gasps]

17:14.633 --> 17:18.436
Max, this is nice.

17:18.438 --> 17:20.972
Max, this is boring.
What happened?

17:20.974 --> 17:23.274
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.

17:23.276 --> 17:24.909
Now I'm thinking
maybe this wasn't

17:24.911 --> 17:26.878
As much fun as I thought it was.

17:26.880 --> 17:31.549
Now I'm thinking
archie's dead.

17:31.551 --> 17:36.454
'cause I feel like I got
a text about it and ignored it.

17:36.456 --> 17:38.723
Even this bellini
doesn't taste as good.

17:38.725 --> 17:41.059
I knew it, my taste buds
must have committed suicide

17:41.061 --> 17:44.262
After my first 7-11 sushi.

17:44.264 --> 17:47.098
I mean, nothing
is the same.

17:47.100 --> 17:49.100
Why did I think this was fun?

17:49.102 --> 17:53.171
Because before you met me,
you didn't know what fun was.

17:53.173 --> 17:54.839
I get your point, max,

17:54.841 --> 17:57.742
But I did own a caribbean island
with six jet skis.

17:57.744 --> 18:00.978
Oh, come on, get over it.
Drink up. It's not that bad.

18:00.980 --> 18:02.680
Can you just let me feel sad?

18:02.682 --> 18:06.217
No!
Not on st. Patrick's day.

18:06.219 --> 18:09.520
You have a good time, and you
don't think about your problems.

18:09.522 --> 18:11.355
That girl who threw up
in her hands,

18:11.357 --> 18:14.025
She didn't sit around saying,
"eh, meh, my life sucks."

18:14.027 --> 18:16.094
No, she threw
her hands in the air,

18:16.096 --> 18:18.096
Hit a lot of people
with the vomit,

18:18.098 --> 18:21.365
And kept the party going.

18:21.367 --> 18:24.569
Yeah, the party was
all over everybody's shoes.

18:24.571 --> 18:27.872
Look, it doesn't matter
that this is literally

18:27.874 --> 18:31.242
The stupidest place I've ever
been in my whole frickin' life.

18:31.244 --> 18:33.611
Let's get another
$40 roberto benigni

18:33.613 --> 18:35.246
And keep our party going.

18:35.248 --> 18:38.749
Come on, let's go.
There's no party here.

18:38.751 --> 18:40.952
There may be a $3 million
bat mitzvah happening upstairs,

18:40.954 --> 18:42.253
But there's no party here.

18:42.255 --> 18:43.621
But I do know
where there is one.

18:43.623 --> 18:47.091
We'll just take
the check, rolph.

18:47.093 --> 18:49.660
And I just remembered
his name is dennis.

18:52.231 --> 18:55.299
Max, I'm sorry if I rained
on your parade today.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.168
Well, peed on it.

18:57.170 --> 18:58.836
Don't worry about it.

18:58.838 --> 19:01.606
Everything that means
something to me gets peed on.

19:01.608 --> 19:03.674
Hey, girls!
I heard you left!

19:03.676 --> 19:07.712
You missed me winning
the hula-hooping contest.

19:07.714 --> 19:09.780
When did you learn
how to hula-hoop?

19:09.782 --> 19:13.317
Once again, I do not know.

19:13.319 --> 19:15.820
You're still rocking
the bagpipe ensemble.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.455
I thought you wanted to keep

19:17.457 --> 19:18.856
Your skirt wearing
on the low-low.

19:18.858 --> 19:21.859
That was before I discovered
the sensation

19:21.861 --> 19:25.963
Of a cool breeze circling
my bag and my pipe.

19:29.201 --> 19:31.502
Hey! Max, caroline!

19:31.504 --> 19:34.005
Excuse me, move it.
Move it. Move it.

19:34.007 --> 19:37.074
Hey, move it.
Wanna break my big-ass clover?

19:37.076 --> 19:40.478
Girls, where did you go?

19:40.480 --> 19:43.080
We went to the plaza,
and I realized my life

19:43.082 --> 19:45.650
May actually be richer now
than when I was rich.

19:45.652 --> 19:50.488
Oh, no. Is it too late
to walk away?

19:52.424 --> 19:54.392
Can you girls
loan me some cash?

19:54.394 --> 19:56.727
I met a girl, and I need
money for the bus

19:56.729 --> 19:59.564
Back from her sister's condo
in jersey city.

19:59.566 --> 20:03.534
She said we've got to be quiet,
but I make no promises.

20:03.536 --> 20:06.437
Sure. I gotcha, han.
What do you need, a 20?

20:06.439 --> 20:09.040
Oh, what the hell? Take 50.
We can always make more.

20:09.042 --> 20:10.241
Or not.

20:10.243 --> 20:12.443
Look at you throwing
the cash around.

20:12.445 --> 20:14.679
You know, girl, there might
be hope for you yet.

20:14.681 --> 20:17.682
Jeanine, I'm good to go.

20:20.018 --> 20:23.521
Told you, girls. 100%.

20:26.358 --> 20:30.261
Looks like they're both
gonna get unlucky tonight.

20:30.263 --> 20:33.397
Hey, max, caroline,
over here!

20:33.399 --> 20:35.900
I save ya a couple of seats.

20:35.902 --> 20:39.704
And a couple of firemen.

20:39.706 --> 20:41.439
Uh, there's no place to sit.

20:41.441 --> 20:44.375
Oh, you are so green.

20:44.377 --> 20:46.978
'sup?

20:46.980 --> 20:50.881
Happy st. Paddy's day!
Where's me kiss?

20:50.883 --> 20:53.251
Oh...

20:58.690 --> 21:00.191
Mm...

21:00.193 --> 21:04.195
Scotch and fish!
