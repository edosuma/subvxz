00:08.760 --> 00:10.320
How's your eggplant?

00:10.390 --> 00:11.220
It's fine.

00:11.290 --> 00:12.420
How's your spaghetti?

00:12.490 --> 00:13.990
I hate you.

00:14.060 --> 00:14.760
Why?

00:14.830 --> 00:16.030
I'm not having spaghetti!

00:16.100 --> 00:18.200
I'm having spagatini!

00:18.260 --> 00:19.160
What's the difference?

00:19.230 --> 00:20.900
Spagatini is a very thin noodles.

00:20.970 --> 00:22.370
Spaghetti is a relatively fat noodle!

00:22.440 --> 00:23.240
We've been over this!

00:23.300 --> 00:24.170
I forgot!

00:24.240 --> 00:26.910
I mean, why did we even take
a pasta class together?

00:26.970 --> 00:28.510
And done.

00:28.580 --> 00:29.780
We're done?

00:29.840 --> 00:31.380
But, we still have a few more lines.

00:31.440 --> 00:33.750
No, I meant this is done.

00:33.810 --> 00:34.750
What is that?

00:34.810 --> 00:36.950
Well, it was a jar of cream,
but now that I've shaken it

00:37.020 --> 00:41.090
vigorously for an hour, it's butter.

00:41.150 --> 00:42.750
You make your own butter?

00:42.820 --> 00:43.760
Indeed.

00:43.820 --> 00:44.690
Is it good?

00:44.760 --> 00:47.690
I don't know, I refuse to eat dairy.

00:47.760 --> 00:51.260
Tori, Beck, take your seats.

00:51.330 --> 00:52.560
If he doesn't eat dairy, why would he...

00:52.630 --> 00:53.470
I don't know. I don't get it.

00:53.530 --> 00:58.200
All right, for the last few minutes
of class, let's talk about

00:58.270 --> 01:06.550
the one-act play I'm directing.

01:06.550 --> 01:07.410
Well?

01:07.480 --> 01:08.910
Well what?

01:08.980 --> 01:11.880
You wanna talk about the
one-act play you're directing?

01:11.950 --> 01:14.590
All right.

01:14.650 --> 01:17.220
First of all, I wanna thank
you all for auditioning.

01:17.290 --> 01:23.400
The two lead roles will be played by...
andre and Robbie.

01:23.460 --> 01:23.960
Cool.

01:24.030 --> 01:26.830
Hot beef.

01:26.900 --> 01:30.100
Would anyone else like to be my guardian?

01:30.170 --> 01:32.500
Did any of the rest of us get parts?

01:32.570 --> 01:36.780
Aw, is a certain little
red-head hoping she got a role

01:36.840 --> 01:38.880
in teacher's play?

01:38.950 --> 01:40.350
She is.

01:40.410 --> 01:43.720
Well, she didn't.

01:43.780 --> 01:46.180
But I do need some help
with the backstage crew.

01:46.250 --> 01:48.950
Jade, cat, I want you girls on lighting.

01:49.020 --> 01:49.860
Lighting?

01:49.920 --> 01:52.490
Yes, you pronounced it perfectly.

01:52.560 --> 01:55.590
Tori, I want you to work with
sinjin's team on special effects.

01:55.660 --> 01:58.600
Okay, but I know like nothing
about special effects.

01:58.670 --> 02:03.470
We'll teach you.

Jessica wolf last night.

03:32.620 --> 03:34.720
Oh yes. I did.

So? How'd it... hi tori.

03:42.900 --> 03:46.170

last update on the slap.

What'd she write?

03:47.340 --> 03:48.470
It's kinda mean.

03:48.540 --> 03:50.940
Read it!

03:51.010 --> 03:53.940
Last night, worst date ever.

03:54.010 --> 03:55.740
Oh.

03:55.810 --> 03:58.680
Well, maybe she went out
with some other guy

03:58.750 --> 04:01.020
after she went out with me
and then she wrote that

04:01.080 --> 04:02.020
about the other guy.

04:02.080 --> 04:03.750
Dude brought a puppet.

04:03.820 --> 04:04.820
A puppet?

04:04.890 --> 04:06.790
Oh she was talking about me.

04:06.860 --> 04:08.120
I'm sorry.

04:08.190 --> 04:09.090
Ah, who cares?

04:09.160 --> 04:11.590
You don't need to be hookin'
up with scrunge like that.

04:11.660 --> 04:17.370
Hi everyone! Yeah.

04:17.430 --> 04:20.200
That's right. Felony jeans.

04:20.269 --> 04:21.540
And they're not knock-offs.

04:21.600 --> 04:22.870
These are real felony jeans.

04:22.940 --> 04:25.010
The realio-dealio.

04:25.070 --> 04:26.570
Realio-dealio?

04:26.640 --> 04:29.510
I think that's Spanish for real deal.

04:29.580 --> 04:32.980
And what's Spanish for dizzy red-head?

04:33.050 --> 04:34.720
Aren't felony jeans like super expensive?

04:34.780 --> 04:35.580
Yes.

04:35.650 --> 04:39.150
Oh, do me a flavor and put this
credit card back in mom's purse.

04:39.220 --> 04:40.590
Why do I have to put it back in mom's...

04:44.790 --> 04:48.060
What are you doin I'm
trying to make myself cry.

04:48.130 --> 04:49.800
Looks like you're about to puke.

04:49.870 --> 04:51.800
Want me to jerk a knot in your tail?

04:51.870 --> 04:53.000
Oh my God.

04:53.070 --> 04:54.900
Why are you trying to make yourself cry?

04:54.970 --> 04:55.500
For the play.

04:55.570 --> 04:57.270
I'm supposed to cry in the last scene

04:57.340 --> 04:59.770
and sikowitz says a real
actor has to cry real tears.

04:59.840 --> 05:00.640
So?

05:00.710 --> 05:01.610
You're a great actor.

05:01.680 --> 05:03.040
Just cry real tears.

05:03.110 --> 05:05.650
You know how hard it is to
make real tears come out?

05:05.710 --> 05:08.420
I mean, I can cry and make
it look real and sound real,

05:08.480 --> 05:10.680
but I don't see how an actor
can just automatically make

05:10.750 --> 05:19.060
actual tears come out
whenever, I mean, it's like...

05:19.130 --> 05:20.830
Well, well you all are girls.

05:20.900 --> 05:26.430
It's easier for girls to cry.

05:26.500 --> 05:34.940
How... how do you... sometimes,
I have trouble not crying.

05:35.010 --> 05:40.710

Grady, take those sand
bags up to the catwalk.

05:52.930 --> 05:55.930
Kay.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.870
I love that they call this a catwalk.

05:58.930 --> 06:05.910
'cause my name is cat,
and look, I'm walking.

06:05.970 --> 06:08.940
Walking on the catwalk.

06:09.010 --> 06:11.910
If someone was pushed off
this catwalk andhey landed

06:11.980 --> 06:14.850
on the floor really hard,
do you think they'd live?

06:14.920 --> 06:16.250
Why are you asking that?

06:16.320 --> 06:22.690
No reason.

06:22.760 --> 06:24.130
Tori.

06:24.190 --> 06:25.030
Hi.

06:25.090 --> 06:27.130
We wanna give you this t-shirt.

06:27.200 --> 06:30.160
It says "special effects crew."

06:30.230 --> 06:33.670
thanks. It looks used.

06:33.740 --> 06:36.600
Yeah, that was my shirt.

06:36.670 --> 06:39.010
What are these stains?

06:39.070 --> 06:41.680
Who can remember.

06:41.740 --> 06:44.880
You can't remember?

06:44.950 --> 06:46.850
It has arrived.

06:46.920 --> 06:49.150
Yeah. There she is.

06:49.220 --> 06:50.550
Cool. What's that?

06:50.620 --> 06:52.450
This is a turblow jet.

06:52.520 --> 06:54.520
To create the Tornado for the play.

06:54.590 --> 06:56.360
Ooh, it blows?

06:56.420 --> 06:57.790

07:03.400 --> 07:12.270
We'll start on medium.

07:12.340 --> 07:13.570
Sorry sinj.

07:13.640 --> 07:17.140
It happens.

07:17.210 --> 07:19.010
Wow, this thing's powerful.

07:19.080 --> 07:19.910
Yup.

07:19.980 --> 07:21.420
And it doesn't just blow.

07:21.480 --> 07:26.450
You flick that little red guy
into reverse... it sucks.

07:26.520 --> 07:29.690
Show her.

07:29.760 --> 07:39.530
Now come here...
whoa, that's insane!

07:39.600 --> 07:47.940
Yeah.

07:48.010 --> 07:51.450
Now that is some serious suckage.

07:51.510 --> 07:54.250
I wanna play with it...
hey.

07:54.320 --> 07:54.980
Hey.

07:55.050 --> 07:56.950
Did you figure out a way
to make yourself cry yet?

07:57.020 --> 07:58.650
Nah. I tried all last night.

07:58.720 --> 08:00.890
And if I don't cry real tears,
sikowitz is gonna say...

08:00.960 --> 08:03.360
Ahhhh! What was that?!

08:03.430 --> 08:05.860
Look! You're crying.

08:05.930 --> 08:06.460
Yeah!

08:06.530 --> 08:08.500
What did you spray in my eyes?

08:08.560 --> 08:11.200
Beast repellent.

08:11.270 --> 08:15.570
It's powerful enough to stop
a man or a medium-size bear.

08:15.640 --> 08:16.740
It burns!

08:16.810 --> 08:20.710
That means it's working!

08:31.990 --> 08:35.419
Okay, everyone, we have 20
minutes before our play begins,

08:35.490 --> 08:38.190
where is my coconut milk?

08:38.260 --> 08:41.159
You're drinking it.

08:41.230 --> 08:44.270
So am I.

08:44.330 --> 08:46.730
Cat, don't turn on 21.

08:46.800 --> 08:47.940
Don't what?

08:48.000 --> 08:49.940
Turn on 21.

08:50.010 --> 08:51.110
21 on.

08:51.170 --> 08:55.210
No, no no.

08:55.280 --> 08:57.440
Cat, you just shocked me!

08:57.510 --> 09:02.880
I'm sorry!

09:02.950 --> 09:04.790
Oh. Hey, tori.

09:04.850 --> 09:05.820
Why aren't you in costume?

09:05.890 --> 09:06.720
I'm goin' to get changed.

09:06.790 --> 09:08.160
Will you watch Rex for me?

09:08.220 --> 09:09.690
Why can't you just take Rex with you?

09:09.760 --> 09:11.230
'cause I don't like to
change in front of him.

09:11.290 --> 09:14.300
He... makes jokes.

09:14.360 --> 09:16.800
Heh heh, yeah I do.

09:16.870 --> 09:18.170
Hush!

09:18.230 --> 09:20.670
Will you just keep an eye on him for me?

09:20.740 --> 09:24.610
Sure.

09:24.670 --> 09:28.440
All right, adolescents,
let's do some quick checks!

09:28.510 --> 09:32.110
Crew, position.

09:32.180 --> 09:36.750
Sunshine. Love it.

09:36.820 --> 09:38.590
Chirping birds.

09:40.360 --> 09:47.060
No, not a cock fight... peaceful birds.

09:48.300 --> 09:49.100
Charming.

09:49.160 --> 09:53.370
Thunderstorm. Excellent.

09:53.440 --> 09:54.600
Lights up.

09:54.670 --> 09:58.410
Next, um, tori, let's see the Tornado.

09:58.470 --> 09:59.210
Full on?

09:59.270 --> 10:02.680
Full on. Blow me away.

10:02.740 --> 10:05.210
Just turn it on.

10:05.280 --> 10:08.280
Here we go.

10:08.350 --> 10:09.780
It's in reverse.

10:09.850 --> 10:10.950
Tori, turn it off!

10:11.020 --> 10:17.960
I know, I know, I know...
turn it off! Turn it off!

10:18.030 --> 10:20.760
Oh my God.

10:20.830 --> 10:27.570
This shirt's a little big, but
I think it looks pretty good.

10:38.920 --> 10:40.520
Let me go! Let me go!

10:40.580 --> 10:42.580
What did you do to him?

10:42.650 --> 10:43.450
Lemme see him!

10:43.520 --> 10:44.550
Let go!

10:44.620 --> 10:46.820
Calm down.

10:46.890 --> 10:49.020
Is Rex okay? Is Rex okay?

10:49.090 --> 10:51.760
Ahh! No. No, no, no, no,
no, nooo, nooo, nooo!

10:51.830 --> 10:54.560
What did you do?

10:54.630 --> 10:58.870
I... I just... I just... um... Rex?
Rex, can you hear me?

10:58.940 --> 11:04.710
Oh. Oh. Is that you, Rob?

11:04.770 --> 11:05.540
Robbie's here.

11:05.610 --> 11:07.540
It's me. It's okay.

11:07.610 --> 11:12.150
I'm... I'm busted up pretty bad.

11:12.220 --> 11:13.320
I've gotta get him to the hospital.

11:13.380 --> 11:15.080
Robbie...
I've got to.

11:15.150 --> 11:16.920
Robbie.

11:16.990 --> 11:18.890
You're starring in this play.

11:18.960 --> 11:21.590
The audience is outside waiting to come in.

11:21.660 --> 11:27.630
It's your job to entertain
them... no matter what.

11:27.700 --> 11:31.500
Oh. I feel cold.

11:31.570 --> 11:33.490
Somebody's gotta take Rex to the hospital.

11:33.500 --> 11:34.310
I'll take him.

11:34.350 --> 11:35.150
I'll drive.

11:35.180 --> 11:36.300
I'll go too.

11:36.330 --> 11:38.430
Okay, does anyone else
think this is bizarre?

11:38.440 --> 11:39.720
C'mon, it can't just be me.

11:41.210 --> 11:42.950
All right, all right, it's showtime!

11:45.000 --> 11:46.500
What'd I miss?

11:46.880 --> 11:48.160
Tori tried to murder Rex.

11:48.190 --> 11:49.250
Sinjin!

11:52.070 --> 11:53.290
Let me have him.

11:53.390 --> 11:55.060
No.

11:55.120 --> 11:56.590
We'll take him to the hospital.

11:57.980 --> 11:59.680
Okay.

11:59.750 --> 12:01.180
I got him.

12:01.250 --> 12:03.080
Take care of him.

12:03.150 --> 12:04.570
I promise.

12:14.090 --> 12:15.380
Well, I'm not missing this.

12:21.150 --> 12:21.740
Hey!

12:22.290 --> 12:23.360
Wait up.

12:23.430 --> 12:24.230
What?

12:24.300 --> 12:25.560
Where are you all going?

12:25.630 --> 12:26.930
To the hospital.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.530
Cat... we're not really
going to a hospital.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.740
It's a puppet.

12:32.800 --> 12:34.610
Not to Robbie.

12:34.670 --> 12:36.170
You know what?

12:36.240 --> 12:38.740
Maybe we should take Rex to the hospital.

12:38.810 --> 12:39.580
Why?

12:39.640 --> 12:43.310
So he can die there.

12:43.380 --> 12:46.620
Jade... it's not good for a
16-year-old guy to go through life

12:46.690 --> 12:50.590
with his hand shoved up a... that.

12:50.660 --> 12:53.490
Maybe this happened for a reason.

12:53.560 --> 12:56.030
But if Rex dies, Robbie's
gonna... get over it

12:56.090 --> 12:56.990
and become a normal person?

12:57.060 --> 12:59.230
Yeah, that'd be tragic.

12:59.300 --> 13:00.770
She's got a point.

13:00.830 --> 13:03.170
I used to think my Uncle
Jesse was a normal person,

13:03.240 --> 13:06.000
but then I found out that every
Sunday, he soaks his feet

13:06.070 --> 13:10.170
in chicken fat.

13:10.240 --> 13:11.340
Let's take Rex to the hospital.

13:11.410 --> 13:11.780
Yeah.

13:11.840 --> 13:12.310
Let's go.

13:12.380 --> 13:13.410
Okay.

13:17.420 --> 13:19.650
But he's a puppet.

13:19.720 --> 13:21.820
Yeah, yeah, we know he's a puppet.

13:21.890 --> 13:23.290
Look, we just want you to hook him up

13:23.360 --> 13:25.390
to one of those beepy machines
and when our friend Robbie

13:25.460 --> 13:27.290
gets here, pretend he dies.

13:27.360 --> 13:30.800
You want me to pretend this puppet dies?

13:30.860 --> 13:33.600
Is there any good reason why a
grown man would soak his feet

13:33.670 --> 13:35.330
in chicken fat?

13:35.400 --> 13:36.670
Chicken fat?

13:36.740 --> 13:40.270
Why don't you go make friends
with the nice lady at the desk?

13:40.340 --> 13:42.670
'kay-kay.

13:42.740 --> 13:43.610
Hi.

13:43.680 --> 13:44.940
So will you do it?

13:45.010 --> 13:45.810
Look, I'm a doctor.

13:45.880 --> 13:46.910
This is a hospital.

13:46.980 --> 13:49.410
I can't justify pretending
that a puppet... come on, doc.

13:49.480 --> 13:50.210
Just do it.

13:50.280 --> 13:53.420
Please?

13:53.490 --> 13:58.220
Will you do something for me?

13:58.290 --> 13:59.690
What?

13:59.760 --> 14:01.360
I have a 16-year-old son.

14:01.430 --> 14:07.670
His name is Lendle and he's,
um, well, he's a loser.

14:07.730 --> 14:09.930
Would you go out on a date with him?

14:10.000 --> 14:13.440
How much of a loser?

14:13.510 --> 14:16.010
Oh my God.

14:16.070 --> 14:18.910
Yeah.

14:18.980 --> 14:22.450
Look, I... tori would love
to go out with Lendle.

14:22.510 --> 14:23.510
Really?

14:23.580 --> 14:26.720
One hour, and it has to
be a dark restaurant.

14:26.790 --> 14:30.150
Done. Bring the puppet.

14:30.220 --> 14:35.430
I don't know why your Uncle would
soak his feet in chicken fat.

14:35.490 --> 14:37.700
Uh, why are you here?

14:37.760 --> 14:40.760
Oh, 'cause this puppet had a
really bad accident and got hurt.

14:40.830 --> 14:43.270
But he doesn't like to be called a puppet.

14:43.340 --> 14:44.740
Mm-hmm.

14:44.800 --> 14:47.710
And how did this puppet get hurt?

14:47.770 --> 14:50.980
See, well, my friend tori was
trying to make a Tornado happen,

14:51.040 --> 14:53.980
but she did it wrong so the
puppet flew across the room

14:54.050 --> 14:55.050
into a big jet fan.

14:55.110 --> 14:56.910
Ooh, a flying puppet.

14:56.980 --> 14:58.220
Yeah.

14:58.280 --> 15:00.120
That's too bad.

15:00.190 --> 15:02.690
Uh, William, would you
please take this young lady

15:02.750 --> 15:03.850
to our "special room"

15:03.920 --> 15:07.390
in section d?

15:07.460 --> 15:10.930
Of course. Come along.

15:11.000 --> 15:15.700
Ooh, an adventure.

15:25.510 --> 15:30.780
Wow. That looks so real.

15:30.850 --> 15:34.080
So when this Robbie kid gets
here... just say that Rex

15:34.150 --> 15:38.220
isn't doing well, let him say
goodbye, and then beeeeeep.

15:38.290 --> 15:40.990
Dead Rex.

15:41.060 --> 15:45.900
Why can't my son be handsome like you?

15:45.960 --> 15:47.700
Hey, what's this?

15:47.770 --> 15:49.700
Oh, this is just a fatty
lump that I removed

15:49.770 --> 15:52.340
from a cab driver's back.

15:52.400 --> 15:55.910
Can I have it?

15:55.970 --> 15:59.110
What school do you kids go to?

15:59.180 --> 16:00.950
I have to go see another patient.

16:01.010 --> 16:04.180
I'll be back in 20 minutes.

16:04.250 --> 16:04.780
Why would you want...

16:05.620 --> 16:06.380
I'd like to look at it.

16:06.450 --> 16:08.150
It's just a little weird.

16:08.220 --> 16:09.420
Who texted?

16:09.490 --> 16:10.290
> andre.

16:10.360 --> 16:11.390
They have one more scene left in the play

16:11.460 --> 16:13.090
and then he's gonna bring Robbie here.

16:13.160 --> 16:13.760
Good.

16:13.830 --> 16:19.060
One hour from now, you dead.

16:19.130 --> 16:21.630
Hey, where's cat?

16:24.140 --> 16:27.810
So, what are these for?

16:27.870 --> 16:29.710
They keep you from hurting yourself.

16:29.770 --> 16:46.090
Oh. Neat.

16:46.160 --> 16:51.130
Bonk. Bonk.

16:51.200 --> 16:52.830
This... they work.

16:52.900 --> 16:54.730
This doesn't hurt at all.

16:54.800 --> 16:56.830
Bonk. Bonk, bonk.

16:56.900 --> 17:00.070
Bonkity bonk, bonk, bonk.

17:00.140 --> 17:02.610
I'm cube-fist-man!

17:02.670 --> 17:06.640
Bonk bonk bonk bonk bonk bonk
bonk bonk bonk bonk bonk...

17:19.160 --> 17:20.720
Andre and Robbie are coming.

17:20.790 --> 17:21.660
Good.

17:21.730 --> 17:22.930
Found him.

17:22.990 --> 17:25.800
I was trying to stop that man from choking!

17:25.859 --> 17:28.270
Yeah, this is really important.

17:28.329 --> 17:30.600
You got your machine set for Rex to die?

17:30.670 --> 17:35.540
Yeah. It'll flat-line
in exactly 15 minutes.

17:35.610 --> 17:36.110
Shhh!

17:36.170 --> 17:39.880
Everyone get ready, get ready!

17:39.940 --> 17:46.320
Oh, Rex.

17:46.380 --> 17:48.320
Is he gonna be okay?

17:48.390 --> 17:54.430
I'm, I'm afraid his
injuries are very serious.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.630
They don't think he's gonna make it.

17:56.690 --> 18:00.460
What in the name a'nancy's goin' on here?!

18:00.530 --> 18:12.910
I'll leave you and Rex alone,
so you can say your goodbyes.

18:12.980 --> 18:17.280
Wait. Tori, will you stay?

18:17.350 --> 18:19.620
Oh, no. Why me?

18:19.680 --> 18:22.450
Well, for one thing, you caused this.

18:22.520 --> 18:23.690
Oh.

18:23.760 --> 18:30.090
And I just really need
the comfort of a woman.

18:30.160 --> 18:33.060
Yep. Yep. I know. It's sad.

18:35.330 --> 18:38.870
Hellooo?

18:38.940 --> 18:43.510
My nose itches and I can't scratch it.

18:43.580 --> 18:45.040
Hellooo?!

18:45.110 --> 18:49.910
Big man who brought me in here?

18:49.980 --> 18:54.420
Oh, I know.

18:54.490 --> 18:57.450
Ooops. Come here nose.

18:57.520 --> 18:59.190
Time to get scratched.

18:59.260 --> 19:03.160
Ooh, here we go.

19:03.230 --> 19:21.040
We better call in a specialist.

19:21.110 --> 19:25.150
I'll never forget the time
we went to mystic mountain,

19:25.220 --> 19:28.490
and I was too scared to go
on the big roller coaster,

19:28.550 --> 19:32.420
so you called me a wienie, and I went on,

19:32.490 --> 19:37.630
I ended up having a great time,
even though I did pee my pants

19:37.700 --> 19:41.100
on the loop-dee-loop.

19:41.170 --> 19:45.100
And, and I know tori's sorry
for what she did to you.

19:45.170 --> 19:48.940
She didn't mean to suck you into
a jet-powered death machine.

19:49.010 --> 19:55.250
I really didn't.

19:55.310 --> 19:57.780
I don't know what else to say to him.

19:57.850 --> 20:00.120
I think you've said enough.

20:00.190 --> 20:07.060
Yeah. I just... wait!

20:07.130 --> 20:09.830
Will you sing his favorite
song to him with me?

20:09.890 --> 20:10.930
What song?

20:11.000 --> 20:13.400
Forever, baby by Michael corcoran.

20:13.460 --> 20:14.700
Do you know it?

20:14.770 --> 20:15.900
Uh, I don't know.

20:15.970 --> 20:17.900
Maybe the chorus?

20:17.970 --> 20:20.300
That's his favorite part.

21:54.830 --> 21:55.200
I dunno.

21:55.270 --> 21:56.700
It started beeping again.

21:56.770 --> 21:57.330
What?

21:57.400 --> 21:58.270
He's alive?!

22:29.130 --> 22:29.730

22:29.800 --> 22:31.130

Lendle.

22:31.670 --> 22:33.440
Lendle.

22:36.010 --> 22:39.710

super-hot guitar player.

No, Lendle's a loser.
