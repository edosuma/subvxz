WEBVTT

00:00.834 --> 00:03.471
The sex was amazing. Shh...
With Lemon?!

00:03.504 --> 00:04.805
She's driving me crazy!
He's driving me crazy!

00:04.838 --> 00:07.275
I so told you that working
together was a bad idea.

00:07.308 --> 00:10.278
I booked you on the
Belles and Bachelors Cruise.

00:10.311 --> 00:11.812
I am not going on that cruise.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.781
And I am not saying it again.

00:13.814 --> 00:14.815
What do you mean that you booked

00:14.848 --> 00:16.184
Crickett and Stanley
in Fancie's?

00:16.216 --> 00:17.285
That's what you needed.

00:17.318 --> 00:18.352
Had I not convinced
Brando Wilkes

00:18.386 --> 00:19.353
to have his wedding.

00:19.387 --> 00:20.554
There's... one...

00:20.588 --> 00:22.156
teeny-tiny other thing.

00:22.190 --> 00:23.091
I'm getting married!

00:23.124 --> 00:24.058
(sighs)

00:24.092 --> 00:25.293
AnnaBeth Nass,
will you make me

00:25.326 --> 00:27.161
the happiest man in the world
and marry me?

00:27.195 --> 00:27.995
I didn't realize you all
were so serious.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.130
We are.
WADE: I'm not gonna be

00:29.163 --> 00:31.199
at the wedding 'cause
I'm gonna be down in Atlanta.

00:31.232 --> 00:33.367
It's where the next
Rammer Jammer's gonna be.

00:33.401 --> 00:35.403
You're moving?

00:35.436 --> 00:36.470
I am so happy for you.

00:41.142 --> 00:42.076
BlueBell...

00:42.110 --> 00:46.314
it is a beautiful day
for the apocalypse.

00:46.347 --> 00:48.282
Wade Kinsella's
moving to Atlanta

00:48.316 --> 00:49.850
to franchise the Rammer Jammer.

00:49.883 --> 00:54.422
Our Meatball is marrying that
lunatic Lily Anne Lonergan.

00:54.455 --> 00:57.091
Fancie's has burned and flooded.

00:57.125 --> 01:01.295
Mm, a biblical omen
if ever there was one.

01:01.329 --> 01:03.197
And AnnaBeth Nass
has been proposed to

01:03.231 --> 01:04.864
by that Gainey fella.

01:04.897 --> 01:07.368
And if she says yes,

01:07.401 --> 01:10.838
then BlueBell will be forever
connected to that vile Fillmore.

01:10.871 --> 01:12.440
Dash, we're sitting
right here.

01:12.473 --> 01:13.874
Mm.

01:13.907 --> 01:16.577
Prepare yourselves,
BlueBellians.

01:16.610 --> 01:17.845
The Four Horsemen

01:17.878 --> 01:20.448
will be galloping up
Main Street any minute.

01:20.481 --> 01:22.583
Well, someone needs to save us.

01:22.616 --> 01:23.584
But who?

01:23.617 --> 01:25.453
I mean, "whom."

01:25.486 --> 01:28.222
My grammar has left me.
Another omen.

01:28.256 --> 01:31.225
GEORGE: The insurance company
 isn't giving us a dime.

01:31.259 --> 01:32.360
I get that you think
that this is my fault.

01:32.393 --> 01:34.162
As does the
insurance investigator.

01:34.195 --> 01:37.331
(sighs)
George, I am so sorry that I...

01:37.365 --> 01:38.466
let you down.

01:38.499 --> 01:40.668
This partnership
means a lot to me.

01:40.701 --> 01:42.470
And so do you.

01:42.503 --> 01:45.473
You have an interesting way
of showing it.

01:45.506 --> 01:48.409
I know that I treated you badly,
and honestly...

01:48.442 --> 01:51.645
I don't know why
you drive me so crazy.

01:51.679 --> 01:55.183
And calling you a bad
business partner-- it was...

01:55.216 --> 01:58.152
it was out of line.

01:58.186 --> 02:01.689
Especially since I'm the one
who set our business on fire.

02:01.722 --> 02:03.324
But...

02:05.526 --> 02:06.594
(sighs)

02:08.628 --> 02:10.931
I'm gonna make this right.

02:10.964 --> 02:14.302
I'm gonna get you every cent
of your money back.

02:15.336 --> 02:16.704
I promise.

02:28.416 --> 02:30.251
Uh, you know, uh, no.
(laughs)

02:30.284 --> 02:32.586
This, uh... this "us"...

02:32.620 --> 02:33.954
This was a bad idea.

02:33.987 --> 02:34.955
No! That's not true.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.257
We actually make a great team.

02:36.290 --> 02:37.391
We just needed...

02:37.425 --> 02:39.527
And when... if...
(nervously chuckles)

02:39.560 --> 02:40.928
our now very...

02:40.961 --> 02:43.464
waterlogged business
ever dries out...

02:43.497 --> 02:44.665
you know what?

02:44.698 --> 02:45.666
It's all yours.

02:45.699 --> 02:47.235
Because...

02:47.268 --> 02:49.169
I'm done.

02:52.306 --> 02:54.174
Okay.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.445
I understand.
(laughs)

02:58.479 --> 03:01.349
Good, good.

03:01.382 --> 03:03.251
Now, if you'll excuse me,

03:03.284 --> 03:05.453
there are some others that
I have to make amends with.

03:08.989 --> 03:09.990
(water running)

03:10.023 --> 03:11.992
LAVON:
What's with you?

03:12.025 --> 03:14.695
Nothing. What's wrong with you?

03:14.728 --> 03:17.365
Nothing.

03:17.398 --> 03:19.967
You're upset about
A.B.'s proposal.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.769
No. No.
I'm glad she found someone

03:21.802 --> 03:23.437
who can give her what she wants.

03:24.738 --> 03:26.374
You're upset because
Wade is leaving.

03:26.407 --> 03:29.277
No. I am happy for Wade.
This is

03:29.310 --> 03:30.744
a great opportunity for him.
So what are you doing

03:30.778 --> 03:32.380
moping all over the place for?

03:32.413 --> 03:34.315
I'm just trying to think
of a good gift for him.

03:34.348 --> 03:35.483
You know? Something that says...

03:35.516 --> 03:37.451
"Good luck on your new
business endeavor,

03:37.485 --> 03:39.287
"about which I have
no particular feelings.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.554
"Save for a vague,

03:40.588 --> 03:42.022
neighborly pride."

03:42.055 --> 03:44.224
So, luggage tags?
(sighs)

03:47.361 --> 03:48.161
Nice.
Yeah.

03:51.532 --> 03:54.335
People, we have
three weddings to save.

03:54.368 --> 03:55.469
Sylvie and Brando have

03:55.503 --> 03:58.339
out of town guests
arriving any minute.

03:58.372 --> 04:00.541
Crickett and Stanley
are celebrating ten...

04:02.343 --> 04:03.444
fascinating years together.

04:03.477 --> 04:05.646
And Meatball and Lily Anne
are in some sort of rush.

04:07.648 --> 04:08.749
Their choice.

04:08.782 --> 04:10.618
And despite

04:10.651 --> 04:13.020
Fancie's sogginess...
we need to show them

04:13.053 --> 04:15.356
our BlueBellian spirit
and put these weddings on.

04:15.389 --> 04:17.391
Well, it's not our fault
you set Fancie's on fire.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.494
Sylvie and Brando
don't even live in BlueBell.

04:20.528 --> 04:22.296
Neither does
that crazy girl singer.

04:23.364 --> 04:24.398
I move that
the town does nothing.

04:24.432 --> 04:25.399
I second.

04:25.433 --> 04:27.067
These people
want to get married,

04:27.100 --> 04:28.769
that's their problem.

04:28.802 --> 04:30.404
What?!

04:30.438 --> 04:33.374
No! No! No! No!

04:33.407 --> 04:35.042
Now, come on now,
this is BlueBell.

04:35.075 --> 04:36.777
And-and like our
great founder,

04:36.810 --> 04:39.313
Cyrus Lavinius Jeremiah Jones...

04:39.347 --> 04:41.649
and all three of his wives,

04:41.682 --> 04:43.050
we-we love love.
(laughs)

04:43.083 --> 04:44.418
So, let-let's pitch in

04:44.452 --> 04:45.753
and-and make this weekend

04:45.786 --> 04:47.521
the most romantic weekend ever.

04:47.555 --> 04:49.089
Huh?

04:49.122 --> 04:51.291
(clears throat)

04:52.560 --> 04:53.661
(loudly clears throat)

04:54.762 --> 04:57.365
Hear! Hear!

04:57.398 --> 04:58.899
(applause)

05:00.568 --> 05:02.403
Yeah. Oh. Uh, um...

05:02.436 --> 05:03.837
I also have an announcement.

05:03.871 --> 05:05.839
Wanda has finally agreed
to the alpacas.

05:05.873 --> 05:07.107
They arrive today.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.076
(whoops, laughs)

05:09.109 --> 05:11.579
Uh... also, uh,
Wanda is pregnant. (laughs)

05:11.612 --> 05:13.681
(applause, cheering)

05:18.852 --> 05:21.389
Hey, AnnaBeth.

05:21.422 --> 05:22.823
Hi.

05:22.856 --> 05:23.857
So, uh...

05:23.891 --> 05:26.494
I heard about Davis' proposal.

05:26.527 --> 05:27.695
Congratulations.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.497
Yeah!
(laughs nervously)

05:29.530 --> 05:31.699
Actually, I told him
I need time to think.

05:31.732 --> 05:33.467
Right.
Mm-hmm.

05:33.501 --> 05:34.502
Well, uh...

05:34.535 --> 05:35.836
you know,
whatever you decide,

05:35.869 --> 05:36.870
good-good luck.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.574
I just hope you're happy.

05:40.608 --> 05:42.576
Okay. Well...
(sighs)

05:42.610 --> 05:44.344
you know, thanks for the hopes.

05:48.549 --> 05:50.851
(sighs)

05:50.884 --> 05:51.719
You okay?

05:51.752 --> 05:53.721
Think she'll say yes?

05:53.754 --> 05:55.155
Not if you tell her not to.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.089
No. No.

05:56.123 --> 05:59.560
I've already treated A.B.
unfairly enough.

05:59.593 --> 06:00.761
And when I compared
our relationship

06:00.794 --> 06:02.430
to other relationships I had,

06:02.463 --> 06:03.797
relationships that were...

06:05.666 --> 06:09.169
...that probably only
existed in my head...

06:09.202 --> 06:10.871
Lavon...

06:10.904 --> 06:13.741
I'm sure they
didn't only exist in your head.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.643
You know, maybe
I'm just one of those people

06:15.676 --> 06:17.911
who doesn't get to be happy.

06:20.681 --> 06:22.816
Hey, Wade, how's
the packing going?

06:22.850 --> 06:25.553
Not bad. Mostly just throwing
stuff in garbage bags.

06:25.586 --> 06:26.954
You know me.
Mm-hmm.

06:26.987 --> 06:29.757
Can't believe I only have
two days left in BlueBell.

06:29.790 --> 06:32.660
I bet they don't have
town meetings in Atlanta.

06:32.693 --> 06:34.462
But you are gonna love it there.

06:34.495 --> 06:36.797
I've never been, but I hear
that Atlanta is great.

06:36.830 --> 06:40.167
You know, except for their
ice storms, which they have now.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.570
Hey, do you have one of those
scrapey things for the ice?

06:42.603 --> 06:43.671
An ice scraper?

06:43.704 --> 06:45.573
Yeah.
Not yet.

06:45.606 --> 06:46.774
Hmm, that's super interesting.

06:46.807 --> 06:48.809
I should go.

06:50.210 --> 06:51.512
(sighs)

06:51.545 --> 06:54.482
(clears throat)

06:54.515 --> 06:56.016
(sportscaster speaking
indistinctly over television)

06:57.718 --> 06:58.786
Another beer?

06:58.819 --> 06:59.853
Yeah.

06:59.887 --> 07:01.655
Should we order a pizza, man?

07:01.689 --> 07:03.791
Yeah.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.926
ANNOUNCER: We'll be back with
some NASCAR action after this.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.761
TODD:
Yes, it's me, Don Todd.

07:07.795 --> 07:09.196
Lavon?

07:09.229 --> 07:10.698
Are you feeling lost in life?
Lavon, Lavon, Lavon, look.

07:10.731 --> 07:13.601
Then I'm talking to you.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.603
You need this.

07:15.636 --> 07:17.605
Put down that beer.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.807
And come see me, Don Todd,

07:19.840 --> 07:21.809
reading my autobiography

07:21.842 --> 07:23.877
Don Todd on Don Todd,

07:23.911 --> 07:25.679
Tallahassee Travel Books

07:25.713 --> 07:28.582
on Apalachee Parkway
tomorrow at noon.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.688
If we leave right now,

07:34.722 --> 07:36.824
we can camp outside
the bookstore

07:36.857 --> 07:38.692
and get really great seats.

07:38.726 --> 07:39.827
Oh.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.795
Aw, but we got the weddings.

07:41.829 --> 07:42.830
They're not our weddings.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.732
Lavon, Fancie's

07:44.765 --> 07:47.000
almost burned to the ground
and I lost almost all my money.

07:47.034 --> 07:48.936
Your ex is probably
getting engaged,

07:48.969 --> 07:50.604
and you might be alone forever.

07:50.638 --> 07:52.039
Did you hear what
the man said?

07:52.072 --> 07:54.508
Put your beer down!

07:56.577 --> 07:57.578
We need this.

07:58.712 --> 07:59.747
We're gonna see Don Todd!

07:59.780 --> 08:00.981
(laughing):
We're gonna see Don Todd!
(whoops)

08:01.014 --> 08:02.249
Who's gonna see Don Todd?

08:02.282 --> 08:03.617
You are!
I'm gonna see Don Todd!

08:03.651 --> 08:04.618
Uh-huh!

08:04.652 --> 08:06.520
You gonna see Don Todd?
I am.

08:06.554 --> 08:07.521
Who's driving?
Oh, m-me!

08:07.555 --> 08:08.589
Let's go! All right.
Yeah.

08:21.569 --> 08:22.836
(hiccups)

08:34.648 --> 08:37.585
(hiccups)

08:37.618 --> 08:39.787
What are you doing?

08:39.820 --> 08:41.789
Oh, hey.

08:41.822 --> 08:42.823
Um, I-I just dropped

08:42.856 --> 08:44.291
(hiccups) my keys.

08:44.324 --> 08:45.793
And also I got you

08:45.826 --> 08:47.060
(hiccups)
a go-- a good-bye gift.

08:47.094 --> 08:48.896
Are you all right?

08:48.929 --> 08:50.598
(hiccups)
Fine.

08:50.631 --> 08:51.632
Just hiccups.

08:51.665 --> 08:52.800
It's an ice scraper.

08:52.833 --> 08:55.669
Wow.

08:55.703 --> 08:56.837
Thank you.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.338
This'll be super useful.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.707
In seven months.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.709
If another ice storm
hits Atlanta.

09:01.742 --> 09:03.310
Well, that's what I thought.
(hiccups)

09:03.343 --> 09:05.312
And I, you know,
I just want you to, um...

09:05.345 --> 09:06.914
(hiccups)
...drive safe.

09:06.947 --> 09:08.081
Because I care...

09:08.115 --> 09:10.684
about safety.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.587
Thank you.

09:13.621 --> 09:15.322
I should
(hiccups) go.

09:15.355 --> 09:17.024
Okay.
Okay.

09:19.627 --> 09:21.629
(sighs)

09:23.864 --> 09:24.932
Boo!
(shrieks)

09:26.634 --> 09:28.335
(laughs)
You're welcome.

09:28.368 --> 09:30.638
See you, Doc.

09:30.671 --> 09:31.839
See you.

09:31.872 --> 09:33.741
For two days.

09:33.774 --> 09:35.709
And then...

09:35.743 --> 09:37.778
not again.

09:37.811 --> 09:40.748
Bye.

09:40.781 --> 09:43.083
(car horn honks)

09:43.116 --> 09:45.152
(seagulls calling)

09:45.185 --> 09:47.621
(birds singing)

09:55.128 --> 09:56.930
Good morning, Blawkerites.

09:56.964 --> 09:58.966
The end of the world
is still upon us.

09:58.999 --> 10:02.736
But at least we'll see
three weddings before we go.

10:04.672 --> 10:05.706
Ow!

10:06.807 --> 10:08.141
I'm sorry.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.645
Probably.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.082
(cell phone ringing)

10:20.721 --> 10:23.691
(groans)

10:23.724 --> 10:24.892
Yallo?

10:24.925 --> 10:26.393
Where are you?
Oh, uh...

10:26.426 --> 10:27.427
Tallahassee.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.963
We're gonna meet Don Todd
live and in person.

10:29.997 --> 10:31.398
(laughs)
Amazing!

10:31.431 --> 10:32.265
ZOE:
Well, turn around

10:32.299 --> 10:34.434
and come home. I need you.
(hiccups)

10:34.467 --> 10:36.837
I went to see Wade last night,
and it hit me.

10:36.870 --> 10:38.105
He's leaving and...

10:38.138 --> 10:39.673
Oh, Big Z...

10:39.707 --> 10:41.141
I don't know, maybe...

10:41.174 --> 10:42.776
Look, Zoe, just
express how you feel.

10:42.810 --> 10:44.144
Don't-don't
keep it inside.

10:44.177 --> 10:46.079
Live fearlessly.

10:46.113 --> 10:48.215
Live like...
Don Todd!

10:48.248 --> 10:50.117
Don Todd.
Don Todd.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.418
Oh, but I have
to go. Bye.

10:51.451 --> 10:53.220
Hello? Lavon? Hello?

10:54.955 --> 10:57.157
Oh, Mr. Todd,
it is a tremendous honor.

10:57.190 --> 10:58.726
A pleasure!

10:58.759 --> 11:00.160
Two people?

11:00.193 --> 11:01.962
Two people showed up
for a book reading.

11:03.063 --> 11:04.164
Well, I'm sure that
everybody just,

11:04.197 --> 11:05.465
you know, went to
the wrong place.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.667
Or there was...
there was weather.

11:08.969 --> 11:10.170
Two people!

11:10.203 --> 11:11.739
That's twice as many
as last time.

11:11.772 --> 11:13.040
Amazing.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.908
Well, what are we waiting for?

11:14.942 --> 11:15.943
Let's go!

11:17.878 --> 11:19.880
(laughing)

11:23.083 --> 11:24.852
Good morning, beautiful.

11:24.885 --> 11:25.919
Mmm...

11:25.953 --> 11:27.454
Hi, there.

11:27.487 --> 11:30.457
So, I-I know you're still
considering my proposal.

11:30.490 --> 11:32.459
Mm-hmm.
I am hoping with every
fiber of my being

11:32.492 --> 11:33.861
you say yes.

11:33.894 --> 11:34.928
And I don't want
to rush you.

11:34.962 --> 11:37.197
But, also, I want us to go
into this whole thing

11:37.230 --> 11:38.932
with eyes open.

11:38.966 --> 11:40.934
No... secrets.

11:40.968 --> 11:42.502
Oh, I agree.

11:42.535 --> 11:45.305
But...
I don't have any secrets.

11:46.874 --> 11:48.075
I have something to show you.

11:48.108 --> 11:49.943
Is it your closet?

11:49.977 --> 11:51.178
The one you never let me in?

11:51.211 --> 11:52.980
Oh, I'm
really

11:53.013 --> 11:54.982
excited.
Is it really messy?

11:55.015 --> 11:56.750
Is there a picture of you,

11:56.784 --> 11:58.485
but you're old
and hideous?

11:58.518 --> 12:00.754
Is it your grandma's skeleton,
and she is dressed

12:00.788 --> 12:02.189
like Roma Downey
from Touched by an Angel?

12:02.222 --> 12:03.991
No. No dead pets.
No skeletons.

12:04.024 --> 12:05.993
But, um,
well...

12:06.026 --> 12:08.261
a... a-a quirk.

12:11.198 --> 12:13.100
That's a lot of sneakers.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.501
A lot of
the exact same sneakers.

12:14.534 --> 12:15.535
Mmm...

12:15.568 --> 12:17.170
They're my favorites.

12:17.204 --> 12:19.106
They're just the right
width and fit.

12:19.139 --> 12:21.008
Perfect
arch support.

12:23.043 --> 12:23.977
I know it's weird.

12:24.011 --> 12:26.914
I hope it's not so weird
that you'll say no.

12:26.947 --> 12:27.981
It's a little weird.

12:28.015 --> 12:29.883
Yeah.
But it-it,

12:29.917 --> 12:32.519
it doesn't change
how I feel about you.

12:32.552 --> 12:34.121
But I
still need

12:34.154 --> 12:35.989
a little more time, okay?

12:36.023 --> 12:37.190
No problem.

12:37.224 --> 12:38.525
Just gonna go for a run.

12:38.558 --> 12:41.261
Then I'm gonna wear these
to breakfast, yeah.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.864
(hiccups)

12:43.897 --> 12:46.033
Our goal is to open up
four more Rammer Jammers

12:46.066 --> 12:47.835
in the South
in the next two years.

12:47.868 --> 12:50.037
In ten, maybe you'll be
the next Bubba Gump.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.039
I do love
popcorn shrimp.

12:52.072 --> 12:53.140
(laughs)

12:53.173 --> 12:54.574
Love him!

12:54.607 --> 12:57.010
What local color.
So...

12:57.044 --> 12:58.879
so I'll be running the Rammer
Jammer in Atlanta, right?

12:58.912 --> 13:00.914
You'll work at corporate
with us.

13:00.948 --> 13:02.249
Oversee things.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.051
You obviously have an eye
for the special touches

13:04.084 --> 13:05.218
that makes this
place unique.

13:05.252 --> 13:07.354
The trick will be
delivering it all in bulk.

13:07.387 --> 13:08.588
Really?

13:08.621 --> 13:09.890
Me.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.825
Working in an office.
You'll love it.

13:11.859 --> 13:13.360
Also, I'm not sure
if you ever asked

13:13.393 --> 13:15.963
about your starting salary.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.100
No way.

13:24.404 --> 13:25.873
Hey! Lady!

13:25.906 --> 13:28.575
How about franchising
the Dixie Stop, too?

13:28.608 --> 13:31.178
It comes with its own
detective agency!

13:34.347 --> 13:37.184
"Because when you're looking
death in the eye,

13:37.217 --> 13:39.086
"there's no time
to think about appearances.

13:39.119 --> 13:40.954
"You don't have time
to think about anything.

13:40.988 --> 13:42.923
"You just square up...

13:42.956 --> 13:44.824
and swing."

13:45.625 --> 13:47.060
Oh, my God,
that was amazing.

13:47.094 --> 13:48.996
Best two hours of my life!

13:49.029 --> 13:50.063
Well, that's
good to hear.

13:50.097 --> 13:51.064
'Cause to tell you the truth,

13:51.098 --> 13:53.100
this is my last book reading.
I'm retiring.

13:53.133 --> 13:54.601
No, you can't retire!
No, no, you have
tons of fans!

13:54.634 --> 13:56.603
That book sold 205 copies.

13:56.636 --> 13:58.605
Well, in BlueBell, Alabama,
you are huge.

13:58.638 --> 13:59.539
A god!

13:59.572 --> 14:01.208
When your show is on,
everything stops.

14:01.241 --> 14:02.910
No! Seriously?

14:02.943 --> 14:04.912
Clearly, fate sent us here today

14:04.945 --> 14:07.080
to convince you, sir,
that you...

14:07.114 --> 14:08.648
you cannot retire.

14:08.681 --> 14:11.018
Because, Don Todd, you matter!

14:11.051 --> 14:13.120
Nay, inspire!

14:13.153 --> 14:14.354
Dozens of people.
GEORGE:
Yeah.

14:14.387 --> 14:16.924
Sir, will you allow us

14:16.957 --> 14:18.225
to take you to BlueBell

14:18.258 --> 14:19.626
so-so you can see for yourself

14:19.659 --> 14:20.928
just how much you matter?

14:20.961 --> 14:22.129
Why the "H" not?

14:22.162 --> 14:24.331
I'm gonna call the next
stop on my book tour

14:24.364 --> 14:26.366
and tell 'em Don Todd
is playing through.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.135
It's a golf term.
Got it.

14:28.168 --> 14:29.269
(laughing)

14:29.302 --> 14:31.038
(whoops)

14:31.071 --> 14:33.073
Daddy?

14:35.175 --> 14:36.376
He's (hiccups)
with Crickett.

14:36.409 --> 14:38.411
She fell rehearsing
her wedding dance.

14:40.948 --> 14:42.950
Dr. Hart, this is
your place of business.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.117
Behave like
a lady.

14:44.151 --> 14:45.986
I'm trying.

14:46.019 --> 14:47.154
I have tried
everything...

14:47.187 --> 14:49.122
water, sugar, holding my breath,

14:49.156 --> 14:52.926
pulling my tongue...
but nothing is working.

14:52.960 --> 14:55.262
I have been hiccupping
for 14 hours!

14:55.295 --> 14:56.263
It's stress.

14:56.296 --> 14:57.931
What? (hiccups)

14:57.965 --> 14:58.932
Who's the doctor here?

14:58.966 --> 15:00.067
It's stress.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.134
You're upset because
Wade is leaving.

15:01.168 --> 15:02.402
No, I'm not.
(hiccups)

15:02.435 --> 15:04.071
Yes, you are,

15:04.104 --> 15:05.272
because you love him.

15:05.305 --> 15:06.974
No, I don't!
(hiccups)

15:07.007 --> 15:08.408
Oh, Zoe Hart, it is so obvious.

15:08.441 --> 15:09.676
Ask yourself this question:

15:09.709 --> 15:12.279
why did you return to BlueBell
after your summer in New York?

15:12.312 --> 15:13.947
Because I had things
to clear up!

15:13.981 --> 15:15.282
And you stayed because...?

15:15.315 --> 15:18.418
Because I realized that
I belong (hiccups) here.

15:18.451 --> 15:20.053
You realized that
you belong here,

15:20.087 --> 15:21.989
or you realized that
you belong with him?

15:22.022 --> 15:23.190
If you recall,

15:23.223 --> 15:25.292
I returned with someone
(hiccups) else.

15:25.325 --> 15:28.061
I was in a serious relationship!

15:28.095 --> 15:29.496
Yes, because you were doing
everything in your power

15:29.529 --> 15:31.231
to deny your
true feelings.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.166
You don't want to be
in love with Wade

15:33.200 --> 15:34.301
because he hurt you,

15:34.334 --> 15:36.003
which is why you
took off to New York

15:36.036 --> 15:37.337
the minute that he told you
that he loved you.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.006
And then you had
to watch him

15:39.039 --> 15:40.207
date your cousin...
(hiccups)

15:40.240 --> 15:41.441
...which proved
that he had changed

15:41.474 --> 15:43.176
and he had grown up,
and it killed you.

15:43.210 --> 15:44.377
Because... guess why.

15:44.411 --> 15:46.713
You... love him, Zoe.

15:46.746 --> 15:48.715
No... I... don't.

15:48.748 --> 15:50.017
(hiccups)

15:50.050 --> 15:52.119
Yes, you do.
I do not!
(hiccups)

15:52.152 --> 15:53.053
You love him.
I don't!

15:53.086 --> 15:54.721
You do!
I don't!

15:54.754 --> 15:56.056
(hiccupping)

15:56.089 --> 15:58.025
Fine, I love Wade!

15:58.058 --> 15:59.059
(exhales)

15:59.092 --> 16:00.360
JOEL:
Okay.

16:01.528 --> 16:03.330
Good
to know.

16:05.098 --> 16:06.733
Hi there.

16:06.766 --> 16:09.336
(giggles)

16:18.145 --> 16:20.113
From your e-mails,
it sounds like

16:20.147 --> 16:21.514
things are going
great with the movie.

16:21.548 --> 16:24.117
Well, that's been
a roller coaster.

16:24.151 --> 16:26.453
Um, I'm just glad I was able
to escape for Sylvie's wedding.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.488
So when do you
leave for London?

16:28.521 --> 16:30.157
Uh, in a
few weeks.

16:30.190 --> 16:33.126
And are you still dating
that comedy writer?

16:33.160 --> 16:34.761
(chuckling):
Yeah...

16:34.794 --> 16:35.695
Yeah, we've
been, uh,

16:35.728 --> 16:37.230
we've been spending
some time together.

16:37.264 --> 16:39.199
It's, um...

16:39.232 --> 16:41.368
it's been good.

16:41.401 --> 16:43.403
Well, I am very
happy for you.

16:45.438 --> 16:48.375
So, BlueBell looks
just the same.

16:48.408 --> 16:50.177
Of course,
it won't be
without Wade.

16:51.444 --> 16:53.046
He called to tell me
he was moving.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.781
Yeah.

16:54.814 --> 16:56.383
Well, it's a huge
opportunity.

16:56.416 --> 16:58.051
So...

16:58.085 --> 16:59.252
are you gonna tell him?

16:59.286 --> 17:00.387
Joel, we are friends,

17:00.420 --> 17:02.322
and I love that we are friends.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.223
But I'm still not
super comfortable

17:04.257 --> 17:05.291
talking to you about this.

17:05.325 --> 17:06.492
Okay, I get it.
You know?

17:06.526 --> 17:08.127
But Zoe, as your friend,

17:08.161 --> 17:09.796
let me just give you

17:09.829 --> 17:13.165
one piece of unsolicited advice.

17:13.200 --> 17:16.069
Don't let Wade leave without
him knowing how you truly feel.

17:18.238 --> 17:20.039
'Cause who knows?
Maybe he feels the same way.

17:21.441 --> 17:23.510
God knows why.

17:23.542 --> 17:25.145
You're so unpleasant
to be around.

17:25.178 --> 17:26.413
(laughs)
Plus ugly.

17:26.445 --> 17:28.281
I mean...
ugh...

17:28.315 --> 17:30.150
(exhales)
(laughs)

17:30.183 --> 17:31.384
You know, Sylvie and Brando,

17:31.418 --> 17:33.320
they don't need us
until tomorrow.

17:33.353 --> 17:35.322
How would you like to be
my plus one tonight?
To what?

17:35.355 --> 17:37.624
Meatball and Lily Anne
Lonergan's wedding.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.559
Are you kidding me? Yes!

17:39.592 --> 17:41.828
So you got your
best man's outfit?

17:41.861 --> 17:43.363
Yeah. Uh...

17:43.396 --> 17:45.132
Hey, are you sure
it's appropriate?

17:45.165 --> 17:47.434
Given mine and-and
Lily Anne's, um, history?

17:47.467 --> 17:48.568
What history?

17:48.601 --> 17:49.569
Uh, we dated.

17:49.602 --> 17:51.138
(laughing):
No, you didn't.

17:51.171 --> 17:52.572
I assure you,
we did.

17:52.605 --> 17:53.840
Wait a minute.

17:53.873 --> 17:56.309
"Run from Wade"
is about you?

17:56.343 --> 17:57.877
Yeah.

17:57.910 --> 17:58.811
Fascinating.

17:58.845 --> 18:00.613
But I mean, who
haven't you slept with?

18:00.647 --> 18:02.582
It's kind of
an honor,

18:02.615 --> 18:04.451
like you're
passing the torch.

18:04.484 --> 18:06.286
Please don't say
that in your vows.

18:06.319 --> 18:08.488
You're looking at the
luckiest man alive!
Okay.

18:08.521 --> 18:09.589
Okay!

18:09.622 --> 18:10.490
Okay...

18:12.325 --> 18:13.460
VIVIAN:
Wade.

18:14.494 --> 18:15.462
Hi.

18:15.495 --> 18:16.896
Vivian.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.598
I-I was wondering
if you'd make it

18:18.631 --> 18:19.866
to Brando's wedding.

18:19.899 --> 18:21.401
How could I miss it?

18:21.434 --> 18:25.205
I'm so sorry about
the way things ended.

18:25.238 --> 18:27.240
You must think that I'm...

18:28.375 --> 18:30.143
But I... I want you to know

18:30.177 --> 18:31.578
that I did not
start things with you

18:31.611 --> 18:32.879
guessing how they would end.

18:32.912 --> 18:35.648
You know, I was, uh...

18:35.682 --> 18:37.584
I was really angry

18:37.617 --> 18:39.719
and hurt by what you did.

18:40.920 --> 18:43.356
But it was
the right thing.

18:43.390 --> 18:45.492
Your family should be together.

18:45.525 --> 18:48.628
I just... I hope
Charles treats you right.

18:50.263 --> 18:51.364
He does.

18:51.398 --> 18:52.532
Thank you for saying that.

18:54.267 --> 18:55.535
Take care, Wade.

18:55.568 --> 18:56.903
You, too.

18:56.936 --> 18:58.405
(piano playing)

18:58.438 --> 19:02.909
* Who knows what
tomorrow brings *

19:02.942 --> 19:05.245
* In a world

19:05.278 --> 19:07.480
* Few hearts survive

19:08.581 --> 19:10.650
* All I know

19:10.683 --> 19:13.320
* Is the way I feel

19:13.353 --> 19:14.921
* When it's real

19:14.954 --> 19:18.325
* I keep it alive

19:18.358 --> 19:23.196
* Love lifts us up
where we belong *

19:23.963 --> 19:26.333
* Where the eagles cry

19:26.366 --> 19:28.435
* On a mountain...
(Stanley grunts)

19:29.402 --> 19:31.271
Ow!

19:31.304 --> 19:33.440
Stanley, ow, that hurt!

19:33.473 --> 19:34.441
I'm so sorry.

19:34.474 --> 19:37.344
But if we had just done
the tandem choreography

19:37.377 --> 19:39.446
that I suggested,
you'd be fine right now.

19:39.479 --> 19:41.448
But no, we had
to do a lift

19:41.481 --> 19:43.550
so that you could be
the center of attention.

19:43.583 --> 19:45.418
Yes, Stanley,
the bride is supposed to be

19:45.452 --> 19:46.653
the center of attention.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.288
Which is going to be hard

19:48.321 --> 19:49.522
when the groom insists

19:49.556 --> 19:50.757
on wearing
a sequined cummerbund!

19:50.790 --> 19:54.294
You know, think of all
you have to celebrate.

19:54.327 --> 19:56.263
(hiccups)
Ten wonderful years!

19:56.296 --> 19:58.298
Yes! Ten years of
waiting for him

19:58.331 --> 20:00.367
to stop using the
hair dryer so I
can get a turn.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.568
You know I have cowlicks!

20:01.601 --> 20:02.969
Why don't we take five?
(hiccups)

20:03.002 --> 20:04.604
Good idea.

20:06.306 --> 20:07.474
You should get a drink of water,

20:07.507 --> 20:09.409
you sound like a dying frog.

20:12.445 --> 20:14.581
What if I told you that Davis
(hiccups)

20:14.614 --> 20:16.749
just showed me he has
a closet full of sneakers,

20:16.783 --> 20:18.718
hundreds and hundreds
of the same pairs?

20:18.751 --> 20:20.587
Well, I'd say good for you.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.989
You don't think it's
a little weird? (hiccups)

20:23.022 --> 20:23.990
Oh, I think it's freakish.

20:24.023 --> 20:25.392
But if he
has secrets,

20:25.425 --> 20:27.794
isn't it best he told you now?

20:27.827 --> 20:30.363
Rather than being married
to someone for ten years,

20:30.397 --> 20:32.399
only to find out
they're not at all

20:32.432 --> 20:33.733
who you thought they were?

20:33.766 --> 20:35.402
I forgot
to tell you,

20:35.435 --> 20:36.636
I asked Micah to
be a groomsman.

20:36.669 --> 20:38.471
Your Pilates
instructor?

20:38.505 --> 20:39.639
He's important to me.

20:39.672 --> 20:41.274
Stanley!

20:41.308 --> 20:42.675
Are you trying
to kill me?

20:42.709 --> 20:44.511
Now I have to find
another bridesmaid

20:44.544 --> 20:45.745
to keep things even!

20:45.778 --> 20:48.247
(hiccups)

20:53.520 --> 20:55.455
$100,000?

20:55.488 --> 20:57.490
No problem.

20:58.625 --> 21:00.293
I'll give you every cent.

21:00.327 --> 21:01.494
Oh!
(laughs)

21:01.528 --> 21:02.529
Grandma...

21:02.562 --> 21:06.032
You are the best!

21:06.065 --> 21:08.501
What's the catch?

21:08.535 --> 21:10.570
That you get on that Belles
and Bachelors Cruise tomorrow.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.639
And you don't get off
until you've met the man

21:12.672 --> 21:14.741
with whom you're gonna share
the rest of your life.

21:14.774 --> 21:17.344
(laughs) Yes, well,
clearly, your new maid has been

21:17.377 --> 21:19.612
messing with your sweet tea,
because I am not making

21:19.646 --> 21:21.047
that kind of a deal.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.315
Why not?

21:22.349 --> 21:24.050
You've been single
for two years.

21:24.083 --> 21:26.419
And you're still no closer
to finding a suitable mate

21:26.453 --> 21:28.421
than the day you were left
at the altar.

21:28.455 --> 21:30.457
Grandma, I've not met anyone
that I feel that way about.

21:30.490 --> 21:33.360
Oh, don't give me that
gobbledygook about true love.

21:33.393 --> 21:36.095
True love is a fiction invented
by the diamond industry.

21:36.128 --> 21:38.798
You don't need true love,
you need a husband.

21:38.831 --> 21:40.667
Grandma, you are telling me
to settle.

21:40.700 --> 21:42.702
I am telling you
to be practical.

21:43.836 --> 21:46.072
Oh, sugar...

21:46.105 --> 21:49.842
your looks could disappear
at any minute.

21:51.778 --> 21:54.080
I don't want you to die alone.

21:54.113 --> 21:55.582
Get on that boat, Lemon.

22:02.689 --> 22:04.824
Oh, my God, Joel Stephens,
I have missed you so much.

22:04.857 --> 22:06.092
I'm having a baby
and three alpacas,

22:06.125 --> 22:07.193
and that is my news.

22:07.226 --> 22:10.730
All right. Well,
good to see you,
too, Tom. (laughs)

22:12.865 --> 22:14.501
Hey, good
to see you, buddy.

22:14.534 --> 22:15.635
Hey.
How you been?

22:15.668 --> 22:18.337
Who could be bad when Meatball's
getting married, right?

22:19.406 --> 22:21.340
Oh, my God,
is that Don Todd?

22:23.810 --> 22:26.613
(Tom gasping)

22:26.646 --> 22:29.516
Ah! Don Todd and Joel Stephens
in the same room!

22:29.549 --> 22:30.583
Mind explosion!

22:30.617 --> 22:31.851
(all gasp)

22:31.884 --> 22:35.455
Mr. Todd, I have read your book
five times.

22:35.488 --> 22:37.790
I even own the audiobook
read by you

22:37.824 --> 22:39.526
and the one read
by Laura Linney.

22:39.559 --> 22:42.161
That's not Laura Linney.
That's my Uncle Jasper.

22:42.194 --> 22:43.162
Oh...

22:43.195 --> 22:45.565
(all laugh)

22:45.598 --> 22:47.800
So, you're leaving
tomorrow?

22:47.834 --> 22:50.470
Yeah, yeah.

22:50.503 --> 22:52.739
Hey, if I don't get
a chance to...

22:52.772 --> 22:55.642
Oh, come on. You're gonna get
a chance. I mean, we live

22:55.675 --> 22:57.744
in the same...
This isn't good-bye.

22:57.777 --> 23:00.547
If everyone would
take their seat.

23:00.580 --> 23:01.981
Oh, oh.
Come on.

23:03.850 --> 23:05.518
(Wade playing amplified riffs)

23:13.760 --> 23:16.563
(plays "Bridal Chorus")

23:18.531 --> 23:20.166
(music stops)

23:20.199 --> 23:22.869
Our couple will sing
their vows.

23:25.505 --> 23:26.673
MEATBALL:
A one, two, three!

23:26.706 --> 23:29.408
* My Lily Anne's so hot

23:30.577 --> 23:33.780
* My Lily Anne's so fine

23:33.813 --> 23:37.784
* I may be a two,
but she's surely a nine. *

23:37.817 --> 23:39.952
Whoo!
Meatball!

23:39.986 --> 23:41.854
Whoo!

23:45.257 --> 23:46.759
* He's my meatball

23:46.793 --> 23:48.194
* He's hairy and sweaty

23:48.227 --> 23:49.962
* But he's a meatball

23:49.996 --> 23:51.931
* He goes great with spaghetti

23:51.964 --> 23:54.000
* He's my hairy, chubby, lovey

23:54.033 --> 23:57.737
* And he'll make a super hubby

23:57.770 --> 24:02.008
* I've had men
from Atlanta to L.A. *

24:02.041 --> 24:06.212
* Who've infuriated me
in each and every way *

24:06.245 --> 24:09.215
* From Adam, Blake and Chuck

24:09.248 --> 24:11.951
* To Sal, Mike
and old G. Tuck... *

24:11.984 --> 24:16.623
Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt,
but is "G. Tuck" George Tucker?

24:16.656 --> 24:18.758
Honey...
'Cause don't you think that was

24:18.791 --> 24:20.527
something maybe
you should have told me?

24:20.560 --> 24:23.229
George is my lawyer.
Wade's my best man!

24:23.262 --> 24:24.964
Sal the Shrimp Guy
is my shrimp guy...

24:24.997 --> 24:27.033
and the town ladies' man.

24:27.066 --> 24:29.536
That's true,
but I prefer "man whore."

24:29.569 --> 24:31.604
You're not a musician.
You don't understand.

24:31.638 --> 24:32.639
The road is hard.

24:32.672 --> 24:33.873
I am a musician!

24:33.906 --> 24:37.009
Or have you forgotten about
a little thing called Mind Face?

24:39.011 --> 24:41.047
My band?!

24:41.080 --> 24:42.782
Don't you know me at all?

24:42.815 --> 24:45.618
Not really.

24:45.652 --> 24:46.853
Maybe we should take a break.

24:46.886 --> 24:49.055
Or a breakup!

24:52.592 --> 24:54.661
Let us use this as a time
for reflection.

24:54.694 --> 24:57.597
While we are all gathered,

24:57.630 --> 25:02.669
is there anyone else
who has something to share?

25:04.837 --> 25:06.706
Actually, I do.

25:12.344 --> 25:15.815
Okay. While we are here,

25:15.848 --> 25:17.984
um, I'd like to take
this moment to... (hiccups)

25:18.017 --> 25:20.887
...on behalf of the entire town,

25:20.920 --> 25:24.290
congratulate Wade Kinsella.

25:24.323 --> 25:26.092
(applause)

25:30.697 --> 25:32.298
We are so proud of him,

25:32.331 --> 25:35.802
uh, for becoming the success
(hiccups)

25:35.835 --> 25:39.138
that we always saw
that he could be.

25:40.773 --> 25:43.042
And, uh, while he's gone,
we're gonna miss him

25:43.075 --> 25:45.044
(hiccups)
a lot.

25:45.077 --> 25:46.045
So much.

25:46.078 --> 25:49.115
Because, well, bec... (hiccups)

25:49.148 --> 25:52.118
...ause we love him.

25:55.955 --> 26:00.059
Okay, no, uh, not we.

26:00.092 --> 26:02.662
Wade, last year you had the guts

26:02.695 --> 26:05.632
to drive across the state
to tell me.

26:05.665 --> 26:09.802
So today I'm telling you...

26:09.836 --> 26:11.671
I love you.

26:11.704 --> 26:13.172
(audience gasps)

26:14.974 --> 26:17.343
So, um...

26:17.376 --> 26:18.778
I told you.

26:20.713 --> 26:22.581
(clears throat)

26:45.004 --> 26:46.773
Nice outfit.

26:46.806 --> 26:49.375
Crickett needed an extra
bridesmaid, so...

26:49.408 --> 26:50.977
So you...

26:51.010 --> 26:53.946
decided to dress
like a, a human cupcake.

26:53.980 --> 26:55.181
That's adorable.

26:57.016 --> 27:00.687
Look, uh,
I got to finish packing.

27:00.720 --> 27:03.122
The investors are coming over
for a final meeting,

27:03.155 --> 27:05.124
and then I take off.

27:05.157 --> 27:06.993
Wait. What?!

27:07.026 --> 27:08.828
That's all you're gonna say?

27:10.863 --> 27:12.799
What do you want me to say?

27:12.832 --> 27:14.867
Oh, I don't know.
I mean, you could acknowledge

27:14.901 --> 27:16.102
how I said I loved you.

27:16.135 --> 27:17.870
And then how
you just walked away?

27:17.904 --> 27:19.739
I guess...

27:19.772 --> 27:23.810
I guess
I didn't know what to say.

27:23.843 --> 27:25.144
Or I did.

27:25.177 --> 27:27.714
Just I didn't want
to say it there...

27:27.747 --> 27:29.081
at the Rammer Jammer.

27:30.917 --> 27:33.019
Zoe, you and I,

27:33.052 --> 27:34.186
we-we tried to make this work.

27:34.220 --> 27:35.855
We tried for a long time.

27:35.888 --> 27:37.189
And it just...

27:37.223 --> 27:38.891
it just didn't.

27:38.925 --> 27:41.227
And no small part of that
is my fault.

27:41.260 --> 27:45.131
I agree. And no small part
of that was mine.

27:45.164 --> 27:46.899
We weren't ready then,
but we are now.

27:46.933 --> 27:48.901
We deserve another chance.

27:48.935 --> 27:52.171
Maybe I thought that once,
but...

27:53.973 --> 27:55.041
I got to go.

27:55.074 --> 27:57.043
And you got
your wedding to get to.

28:05.885 --> 28:09.055
You were right. Visiting
BlueBell has been so inspiring.

28:09.088 --> 28:11.023
So, you'll go back
to doing your show?

28:11.057 --> 28:12.725
Forget about throwing
in the towel?

28:12.759 --> 28:14.693
Throw in the towel? Never!
You can't!

28:17.229 --> 28:20.199
My retirement depends on how
well I do on my next hole.

28:20.232 --> 28:21.934
Gentlemen...

28:24.036 --> 28:25.471
wish me luck.

28:25.504 --> 28:29.776
I'm about to take the
most dangerous shot of my life.

28:29.809 --> 28:32.278
More dangerous
than when you putted

28:32.311 --> 28:34.080
into the mouth of the python?

28:34.113 --> 28:36.115
More dangerous than when
you made eagle

28:36.148 --> 28:37.950
from the actual nest
of an eagle?

28:37.984 --> 28:39.285
You boys want to come with me?

28:39.318 --> 28:40.753
Are you kidding?
Obviously!

28:40.787 --> 28:41.320
Shotgun!

28:44.957 --> 28:49.161
I have been making these sounds
for (hiccups) hours!

28:49.195 --> 28:51.497
I looked it up
on the Internet,

28:51.530 --> 28:54.801
and could have pneumonia,
pleurisy or (hiccups)
pharyngitis.

28:54.834 --> 28:55.902
We're (hiccups) dying.

28:55.935 --> 28:57.804
(hiccups)
On my wedding day!

28:57.837 --> 28:59.839
ZOE:
You know, I had
hiccups yesterday,

28:59.872 --> 29:01.908
and I think mine were caused
because I had something

29:01.941 --> 29:02.775
I needed to say.

29:02.809 --> 29:04.844
And then when I said it,
they went away.

29:04.877 --> 29:06.813
I don't (hiccups)
know what you're
talking about.

29:06.846 --> 29:09.148
I don't have (hiccups)
anything to say.

29:09.181 --> 29:10.282
Me (hiccups) either!

29:10.316 --> 29:12.018
Sadie!

29:12.051 --> 29:14.220
You're pulling me
too (hiccups) tight.

29:14.253 --> 29:15.254
Stop!

29:15.287 --> 29:17.890
Sorry, Crickett.

29:17.924 --> 29:19.191
Crickett,
what's going on?

29:19.225 --> 29:22.061
Nothing! (hiccups)

29:22.094 --> 29:27.033
Honey, we've all admired
what you've done

29:27.066 --> 29:29.268
to keep your (hiccups)
marriage together.

29:29.301 --> 29:32.271
But if there is some
insurmountable obstacle

29:32.304 --> 29:35.274
in your relationship,
everyone will understand

29:35.307 --> 29:38.110
if you don't want
to keep up the charade.

29:40.146 --> 29:41.914
(hiccups)

29:44.316 --> 29:48.054
WADE: Wow, they, uh, they all
look exactly the same.

29:48.087 --> 29:50.356
People need to know
from the second they enter,

29:50.389 --> 29:51.891
they're in a Rammer Jammer.

29:51.924 --> 29:52.959
Right.

29:52.992 --> 29:54.293
Authentic
Alabama cuisine.

29:54.326 --> 29:56.028
In North Carolina?

29:56.062 --> 29:57.864
Yeah. Who are you?

29:57.897 --> 30:01.133
Joel. Um, Innocent,
enthusiastic bystander.

30:01.167 --> 30:02.268
And soon to be silent one.

30:02.301 --> 30:04.170
Hey, I got you a present.

30:04.203 --> 30:06.238
All right, I love presents.
(chuckles)

30:06.272 --> 30:07.239
Oh...

30:07.273 --> 30:08.274
It's called a tie.

30:08.307 --> 30:10.009
You're gonna
need it in Atlanta.

30:10.042 --> 30:11.243
I'll let you say
your good-byes.

30:11.277 --> 30:13.379
All right.
Joel.

30:16.615 --> 30:18.985
What, you think it's a bad idea?

30:19.018 --> 30:21.187
I just don't really see you
as a tie guy.

30:21.220 --> 30:24.290
You like making up drinks
and adjusting the menu,

30:24.323 --> 30:26.158
breaking up bar fights.
That's you.

30:26.192 --> 30:28.160
Yeah, well,
maybe a super rich guy

30:28.194 --> 30:31.630
with, like, four porn star
girlfriends is also me.

30:31.663 --> 30:33.032
You never know until you try.

30:36.435 --> 30:40.106
*

30:41.673 --> 30:43.275
GEORGE:
So, I don't understand it.

30:43.309 --> 30:45.377
Where-Where are you gonna hit
your shot from?

30:45.411 --> 30:47.146
There's not even a dangerous
intersection around.

30:47.179 --> 30:48.214
Or alligator swamp.

30:48.247 --> 30:49.348
Or golf course.

30:49.381 --> 30:51.884
Boys, today
we're gonna take a mulligan

30:51.918 --> 30:53.619
on the great Fairway of Life.

30:53.652 --> 30:55.121
What does that
mean exactly?

30:55.154 --> 30:58.357
Well, yesterday...

30:58.390 --> 31:01.961
after hearing
that little doctor talk,

31:01.994 --> 31:05.231
I realized I spent all these
years trying to make

31:05.264 --> 31:06.665
these impossible holes

31:06.698 --> 31:09.401
because I have an enormous one
in my heart.

31:09.435 --> 31:12.338
Wait-- we are going to see you
play golf, right?

31:12.371 --> 31:16.275
No. We're going to Pensacola

31:16.308 --> 31:19.045
to tell my ex-wife
that I want her back.

31:22.014 --> 31:23.315
Uh, that doesn't
sound like fun.

31:23.349 --> 31:25.985
Not at all.
Shotgun.

31:29.288 --> 31:30.256
What's the delay?

31:30.289 --> 31:32.024
I don't know.

31:32.058 --> 31:34.060
I'm not really a bridesmaid,
just a stand-in.

31:34.093 --> 31:35.394
Ah, we'll start soon.

31:35.427 --> 31:36.963
You know Stanley.

31:36.996 --> 31:38.664
He's such a perfectionist.

31:38.697 --> 31:39.966
That's one thing he is.

31:39.999 --> 31:42.068
(chuckles)

31:42.101 --> 31:45.004
Oh, Lemon.
Another glass of champagne.

31:45.037 --> 31:46.472
You look like something
Hello Kitty coughed up.

31:46.505 --> 31:48.107
Thank you.
Although I really don't need

31:48.140 --> 31:49.976
to be insulted anymore today.

31:50.009 --> 31:51.910
Zoe.

31:53.345 --> 31:55.181
Listen, um.

31:55.214 --> 31:58.184
I heard about your little
outburst at Meatball's wedding.

31:58.217 --> 31:59.285
Ooh!

31:59.318 --> 32:01.053
Must've been humiliating.
(laughs)

32:01.087 --> 32:03.089
But also sort of brave.

32:03.122 --> 32:05.291
I'm impressed.

32:05.324 --> 32:06.692
What did Wade say?

32:06.725 --> 32:07.960
Not much.

32:07.994 --> 32:11.263
I'm sorry.

32:11.297 --> 32:13.232
You know, Zoe, maybe it's time

32:13.265 --> 32:15.968
for both of us to realize that
there are no second chances.

32:16.002 --> 32:18.704
I was once in a great

32:18.737 --> 32:20.006
relationship.

32:20.039 --> 32:21.407
Two, actually.

32:21.440 --> 32:24.176
But then I just
realized that

32:24.210 --> 32:25.978
holding onto the
memories of those

32:26.012 --> 32:27.713
have just been keeping me
from finding happiness.

32:27.746 --> 32:30.116
So, tonight

32:30.149 --> 32:33.219
I will be boarding
the S.S. Desperation.

32:33.252 --> 32:35.321
You're going on a cruise?

32:35.354 --> 32:38.324
Yes, I'm gonna find
a new beginning.

32:38.357 --> 32:40.726
Or an iceberg.

32:40.759 --> 32:42.028
Whatever comes first.

32:42.061 --> 32:43.996
(piano starts playing)

32:44.030 --> 32:45.464
Got to go!

33:10.489 --> 33:12.391
(Crickett hiccupping)

33:15.094 --> 33:17.096
Are you all right?

33:23.569 --> 33:24.770
Stop the music!

33:24.803 --> 33:27.073
Please.

33:27.106 --> 33:28.474
What? Why are we stopping?

33:28.507 --> 33:31.077
I'm sorry, Stanley.

33:31.110 --> 33:33.512
Folks, I'm
(hiccups) sorry.

33:33.545 --> 33:36.448
I can't do this.

33:36.482 --> 33:38.217
It's 2014.
(hiccups)

33:38.250 --> 33:41.120
Nobody has to pretend
to be something

33:41.153 --> 33:42.554
they're not anymore.
(hiccups)

33:43.855 --> 33:45.291
It's time you knew the truth.

33:45.324 --> 33:48.294
I am gay!

33:48.327 --> 33:51.097
(crowd gasps)

33:51.130 --> 33:53.132
What?

34:01.440 --> 34:02.841
Look at that.

34:02.874 --> 34:05.344
My hiccups are gone.

34:19.358 --> 34:21.827
Give Sylvie and Brando my best.

34:21.860 --> 34:23.529
You know, you don't have to go.

34:23.562 --> 34:24.830
Already told everyone
I was leaving.

34:24.862 --> 34:25.964
And they'd be happy
to have you back.

34:25.996 --> 34:29.268
Just step back behind the bar
and into your old life.

34:29.301 --> 34:31.337
Nah. No.

34:31.370 --> 34:32.338
So, what then?

34:40.212 --> 34:42.848
Oh, I see.

34:42.880 --> 34:44.183
Yup.

34:48.620 --> 34:51.257
Don Todd in love.

34:51.290 --> 34:53.259
He's not supposed to care about
love-- that's why he's my hero.

34:53.292 --> 34:55.161
More manly.

34:55.194 --> 34:57.163
No, it's embarrassing
is what it is.

34:57.196 --> 34:59.165
I just got off the phone
with Wanda.

34:59.198 --> 35:00.466
We have really missed a lot.

35:00.499 --> 35:03.469
Davis Polk has
200 pairs of sneakers.

35:03.502 --> 35:05.871
Lemon's going on a Belles and
Bachelors Cruise for a month,

35:05.904 --> 35:08.207
claims she's coming
back engaged.

35:08.240 --> 35:11.177
And Crickett is gay.
Wait, what?

35:11.210 --> 35:12.344
DAVIS:
 Man, that's surprising.

35:12.378 --> 35:14.180
(chuckles)
Crickett?

35:14.213 --> 35:15.481
I didn't see that one coming.

35:15.514 --> 35:17.883
(hiccups)

35:17.916 --> 35:19.185
A.B., are you okay?

35:19.218 --> 35:20.486
Yeah.
(hiccups)

35:20.519 --> 35:21.687
Are you sure?

35:21.720 --> 35:24.656
Um, just...
(quiet laugh)

35:24.690 --> 35:26.492
I have my answer.

35:26.525 --> 35:28.394
Y-You do?

35:28.427 --> 35:29.428
I-Is it...?

35:29.461 --> 35:30.596
TODD:
 Great news!

35:30.629 --> 35:32.598
It went well?
Well...

35:32.631 --> 35:34.900
did you ever see
that episode where I got stung

35:34.933 --> 35:36.468
by the brood of jellyfish?

35:36.502 --> 35:38.370
Then I lost my nine iron
to the octopus?

35:38.404 --> 35:39.371
Yeah.

35:39.405 --> 35:41.440
This was way worse than that.

35:41.473 --> 35:43.409
Miss Glendora

35:43.442 --> 35:44.610
has moved on.

35:44.643 --> 35:46.512
I have missed my chance.

35:46.545 --> 35:49.181
Then, why are you so happy?

35:49.215 --> 35:49.981
Well, because now I can move on.

35:50.015 --> 35:51.550
See, I laid it all out
on the table.

35:51.583 --> 35:54.220
Now I know I've done
everything I could.

35:54.253 --> 35:55.387
Everything you could.

35:55.421 --> 35:56.222
In hindsight,

35:56.255 --> 35:58.490
I should've done it
four years ago.

35:58.524 --> 36:00.626
Now I don't have to spend
every day thinking

36:00.659 --> 36:02.561
maybe she feels it, too.

36:02.594 --> 36:05.231
And it's like
the sun has come out

36:05.264 --> 36:07.533
on a brand-new day for Don Todd.

36:07.566 --> 36:10.236
Like any other man
in my shoes,

36:10.269 --> 36:11.537
I want to go hit a few holes.

36:11.570 --> 36:13.239
Who's with me?

36:13.272 --> 36:14.240
This guy.

36:14.273 --> 36:15.241
Actually, I have to go.

36:15.274 --> 36:17.243
Uh, was that a rent-a-car place
on the corner?

36:17.276 --> 36:18.377
What? Yeah.

36:18.410 --> 36:19.411
(stammers)

36:19.445 --> 36:21.947
ANNABETH:
 I admire

36:21.980 --> 36:24.383
how organized
you keep your closet.

36:24.416 --> 36:26.218
All those (hiccups) sneakers

36:26.252 --> 36:28.254
make you more lovable to me.

36:28.287 --> 36:29.288
It lets me (hiccups)

36:29.321 --> 36:31.457
see that you have flaws.

36:31.490 --> 36:33.592
That you're not just
that perfect knight.

36:33.625 --> 36:34.660
AnnaBeth, you've been
complimenting me

36:34.693 --> 36:36.295
for the last five minutes.

36:36.328 --> 36:38.297
Is this going
where I think it is?

36:38.330 --> 36:40.799
Or is there a big "but" coming?

36:42.000 --> 36:42.968
But...

36:43.001 --> 36:46.705
I've been in
your position.

36:46.738 --> 36:49.275
I-I've been the rebound person.

36:49.308 --> 36:52.711
Which is why I know
you deserve more

36:52.744 --> 36:55.514
than to settle for someone

36:55.547 --> 36:57.416
who's still in love
with someone else.

37:00.619 --> 37:01.987
Don?

37:02.020 --> 37:03.322
Might I ask exactly
what happened

37:03.355 --> 37:05.524
between you and your wife?

37:05.557 --> 37:07.793
We drove each other crazy
whenever we were together.

37:07.826 --> 37:09.695
It's like we fought
because we were

37:09.728 --> 37:10.996
afraid to let the other know

37:11.029 --> 37:13.399
how deeply we felt.

37:13.432 --> 37:14.333
That's beautiful.

37:14.366 --> 37:17.002
I think there's
a driving range around here.

37:17.035 --> 37:18.404
You all in?

37:18.437 --> 37:20.472
Um, actually...

37:20.506 --> 37:22.474
I'm gonna need you to
drop me off somewhere.

37:22.508 --> 37:26.244
'Cause I have to get to the
woman that drives me crazy.

37:32.784 --> 37:34.420
SYLVIE:
 My first husband Jerry

37:34.453 --> 37:38.324
was the love of my life,
and when he died,

37:38.357 --> 37:40.326
I felt like...
The days were just things

37:40.359 --> 37:42.561
to pass the time
till you joined Jerry.

37:42.594 --> 37:44.463
And I joined
my Margaret May.

37:44.496 --> 37:45.764
And then...
I met you.

37:45.797 --> 37:48.033
SYLVIE:
My miracle.

37:48.066 --> 37:49.635
Not only do I feel love again.

37:49.668 --> 37:51.303
I feel joy.

37:51.337 --> 37:52.304
Joy.

37:52.338 --> 37:53.439
And I want to thank you

37:53.472 --> 37:56.675
for what I never thought
was possible.

37:56.708 --> 37:58.544
True love twice.

37:58.577 --> 37:59.745
A second chance.

38:03.382 --> 38:04.683
(crowd clapping)

38:07.686 --> 38:10.055
Ooh.
(chuckles)

38:10.088 --> 38:10.756
(glass shatters)

38:10.789 --> 38:12.324
Yes! Mazel tov!

38:17.663 --> 38:19.331
(line ringing)

38:19.365 --> 38:20.699
Why are you calling me?

38:20.732 --> 38:22.668
Because second chances exist.

38:22.701 --> 38:24.570
We can find love again.
Don't get on that boat.

38:24.603 --> 38:26.071
I can't hear you. What?

38:26.104 --> 38:27.406
Don't give up on true love!

38:27.439 --> 38:28.574
I'm sorry, I don't get...

38:28.607 --> 38:30.075
Hello?

38:30.108 --> 38:31.477
Lemon? You heard me?

38:31.510 --> 38:32.678
You're coming back, right?

38:32.711 --> 38:35.547
Hello?

38:35.581 --> 38:37.449
MAN:
Haven't you heard?

38:37.483 --> 38:39.585
Cell service is
terrible on the ship.

38:39.618 --> 38:42.087
You won't be able to make
any calls for 30 days.

38:42.120 --> 38:45.591
I guess we'll just need to find
other ways to pass the time.

38:45.624 --> 38:47.359
(laughs)

38:56.134 --> 38:59.505
*

39:13.785 --> 39:15.487
(clears throat)

39:17.689 --> 39:19.391
What are you doing here?

39:19.425 --> 39:20.859
I thought you'd be
on the road to Atlanta.

39:20.892 --> 39:22.761
I turned it down.

39:22.794 --> 39:25.531
Yeah, I think one Rammer Jammer
is enough for this world.

39:25.564 --> 39:26.465
Really?

39:26.498 --> 39:27.466
They wanted me to wear

39:27.499 --> 39:28.700
a suit and tie, you know?

39:28.734 --> 39:30.636
Work a desk job.
It's not for me.

39:31.903 --> 39:33.872
Don't read too much
into it, all right?

39:33.905 --> 39:34.740
Okay.

39:34.773 --> 39:36.442
Seriously.

39:36.475 --> 39:37.476
Okay.

39:37.509 --> 39:39.511
(humming along with music)

39:52.924 --> 39:54.626
Thank you guys so much!

39:54.660 --> 39:56.662
Hurry up!
The boat's leaving in a minute!

39:56.695 --> 39:57.663
G. Tuck,

39:57.696 --> 39:58.897
go tell Lemon how you feel!

39:58.930 --> 40:01.900
Viva romance!

40:01.933 --> 40:04.402
Yeah.

40:05.937 --> 40:07.673
Excuse me, sorry.

40:07.706 --> 40:09.608
No, no, no, no! Hold on!

40:09.641 --> 40:11.777
You have to let me on that boat.

40:11.810 --> 40:12.978
Sorry, sir, the ship
is already underway.

40:13.011 --> 40:15.447
No, no!
We're all clear for departure.

40:16.815 --> 40:18.950
Lemon!

40:19.818 --> 40:21.186
Lemon!

40:21.219 --> 40:22.654
Lemon!

40:22.688 --> 40:23.789
(whistling)

40:23.822 --> 40:25.657
Lemon Breeland.

40:25.691 --> 40:26.925
Yes, I've heard of you.

40:26.958 --> 40:29.194
Oh, well, don't believe
everything you hear.

40:29.227 --> 40:30.596
(both laugh)

40:30.629 --> 40:31.830
(hiccups)

40:31.863 --> 40:33.699
MAN:
Find a good one.
WOMAN:
Call me when you get there.

40:33.732 --> 40:35.934
Lemon!

40:37.736 --> 40:39.571
(ship horn blows)

40:39.605 --> 40:41.039
Lemon!

40:43.709 --> 40:44.743
George?

40:45.844 --> 40:47.713
Lavon?

40:53.852 --> 40:55.687
No.

40:55.721 --> 40:58.023
No, no, no...

40:58.056 --> 41:01.627
BOTH:
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

41:02.994 --> 41:05.931
200 pairs of shoes, huh?

41:05.964 --> 41:08.734
Yeah, I think you made
the right move there.

41:10.569 --> 41:12.971
Oh, ma-may I cut in?

41:13.004 --> 41:15.006
By all means.

41:19.277 --> 41:21.046
Hey there.

41:21.079 --> 41:23.782
Stop looking at me like that.

41:23.815 --> 41:24.916
What?

41:24.950 --> 41:26.652
I'm just glad
that you're staying.

41:26.685 --> 41:28.987
Okay, good.

41:29.020 --> 41:31.857
And, yes,
I know that you believe

41:31.890 --> 41:33.825
that we don't have
a future together.

41:33.859 --> 41:36.595
But, Wade Kinsella,
you are just so wrong.

41:36.628 --> 41:38.964
And I'm gonna prove it.

41:38.997 --> 41:41.800
As long as it takes.

41:41.833 --> 41:43.669
I'm not giving up.
