WEBVTT

00:01.401 --> 00:02.168
This is
the Evergreen Forest.

00:04.204 --> 00:06.539
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:07.707 --> 00:10.777
That is, until Bert
Raccoon wakes up.

00:24.124 --> 00:27.227
Luckily, he has some good
friends to help him out.

00:34.534 --> 00:37.404
Life would be simple in
the forest except for...

00:38.471 --> 00:39.539
Cyril Sneer.

00:43.376 --> 00:46.679
And his life would
be except for...

00:46.679 --> 00:48.214
"The Raccoons".

01:02.729 --> 01:05.532
It's another beautiful day
in the Evergreen Forest.

01:05.532 --> 01:08.868
The sun is out, and so
are Bert and Cedric,

01:08.868 --> 01:11.704
practicing for the upcoming
Forest Skateboarding Contest.

01:12.772 --> 01:15.442
Bert Raccoon
dazzles the spectators

01:15.442 --> 01:18.411
on his forest flyer skateboard.

01:18.411 --> 01:21.714
He executes a 360 degree spin,

01:21.714 --> 01:23.349
followed by a quick pickup

01:23.349 --> 01:27.253
and finishes with a hair
raising hand plant deck.

01:27.253 --> 01:28.354
The crowd goes nuts,

01:29.756 --> 01:33.026
as the flyer is passed off
to Cedric "The Bullet" Sneer.

01:33.026 --> 01:37.263
He rips down the last leg
of the tandem team event

01:37.263 --> 01:40.900
His thoughts focused only
one thing, the finish line.

01:42.635 --> 01:44.771
What an amazing win by

01:44.771 --> 01:48.575
the team of Bert Raccoon
and Cedric Snare.

01:49.709 --> 01:51.911
How about a
victory soda, Bert?

01:51.911 --> 01:54.180
We even think alike!

01:55.215 --> 01:57.350
Wow!

01:57.350 --> 01:59.319
That could be ours, Cedric.

01:59.319 --> 02:01.020
A custom designed,

02:01.020 --> 02:05.592
limited edition super
deluxe racing model!

02:05.592 --> 02:07.060
Yeah.

02:07.060 --> 02:11.231
First prize in the skateboard
race. That would be nice.

02:11.231 --> 02:13.333
I sure hope the flyer holds up.

02:13.333 --> 02:15.802
Ah, don't worry, Cedric.

02:15.802 --> 02:18.004
The old flyer won't let us down.

02:20.573 --> 02:23.109
Hi Pop, what are
you doing here?

02:23.109 --> 02:25.645
I heard about the
skateboard contest.

02:25.645 --> 02:27.013
You are entering?

02:27.013 --> 02:30.383
Of course not,
skateboarding is for kids.

02:30.383 --> 02:32.385
Making money is for Sneers!

02:32.385 --> 02:35.922
And with this little
beauty, I intend to cash in!

02:35.922 --> 02:38.525
- Wow! What a beauty!
- Wow look at that board!

02:38.525 --> 02:39.659
It looks super!

02:39.659 --> 02:42.595
Not so fast you masked menace!

02:42.595 --> 02:45.732
This neuro sonic
skateboard's a prototype.

02:45.732 --> 02:47.567
The only one of it's kind.

02:47.567 --> 02:49.269
When people get a look at it,

02:49.269 --> 02:51.971
the orders will
come flooding in!

02:51.971 --> 02:55.008
I'll get richer and Steer
Enterprises will become

02:55.008 --> 02:57.911
the dominant force
in the industry!

02:57.911 --> 03:02.815
I doubt that very
much Mr. Sneer.

03:03.917 --> 03:04.717
What are you
talking about, Knox?

03:04.717 --> 03:06.219
May introduce...

03:07.554 --> 03:10.857
The Knox Eliminator.

03:11.891 --> 03:13.393
- Whoa!
- Wow!

03:13.393 --> 03:18.164
It is the latest and it is
the greatest skateboard ever.

03:19.132 --> 03:21.401
What's the big idea here Knox?

03:21.401 --> 03:23.369
I intend to put you

03:23.369 --> 03:27.774
and that board of
yours out of business.

03:28.942 --> 03:31.211
And how do you
intend to do that?

03:31.211 --> 03:33.446
By winning the
skateboard race of cause.

03:35.548 --> 03:38.918
You have entered, haven't ya?

03:38.918 --> 03:40.954
Of course I have!

03:42.155 --> 03:45.692
And you are going
to lose!

03:48.661 --> 03:53.333
Oh no! Mud Man is
really in trouble now!

03:53.333 --> 03:55.435
Who's really in trouble?

03:55.435 --> 03:59.005
Hey, go away. This
is our Mud Man comic.

03:59.005 --> 04:01.874
We better switch
to the privacy page.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.777
Hey!

04:04.777 --> 04:07.680
You need grime
glasses to read it.

04:07.680 --> 04:10.216
Yeah, and to get them,

04:10.216 --> 04:15.221
you have to belong to the Mud
Man fan club, The Goop Troop.

04:16.322 --> 04:19.425
Wow. Mud Man is in
real trouble this time.

04:19.425 --> 04:21.861
He's trapped in a net in a tree

04:21.861 --> 04:24.364
and the Sponge
Monster is coming.

04:24.364 --> 04:25.632
Oh!

04:25.632 --> 04:28.301
He might just get
wiped out this time!

04:28.301 --> 04:31.838
Hey, maybe the fire
department could save him.

04:31.838 --> 04:35.074
They're always getting
cats out of trees.

04:37.744 --> 04:39.979
What a bacon brain!

04:39.979 --> 04:43.850
You have no idea of
the powers of Mud Man.

04:43.850 --> 04:47.520
Or his trusty
sidekick, The Dishwater Kid!

04:47.520 --> 04:49.822
Mud Man will turn to gloop

04:49.822 --> 04:52.759
and slither through
the holes in the net.

04:52.759 --> 04:54.727
Then he and The Dishwater Kid

04:54.727 --> 04:57.263
will unleash a mighty flurry-

04:57.263 --> 04:59.098
Of muck-o-balls!

05:00.366 --> 05:04.504
Pigs! My office, pronto!

05:04.504 --> 05:07.573
That's right, put everyone
on triple overtime!

05:07.573 --> 05:10.410
I want that prototype
finished on time!

05:10.410 --> 05:12.312
I can't afford to
lose that race.

05:13.413 --> 05:15.682
You screamed, sir?

05:15.682 --> 05:17.216
What are you pork pies doing?

05:17.216 --> 05:19.185
Trying to make
spectacles of yourselves?

05:19.185 --> 05:22.822
Oh no, sir. They're for
reading Mud Man comics.

05:22.822 --> 05:26.659
Reading comics on the
job eh? Well read my lips.

05:26.659 --> 05:29.529
Deliver these boxes
to Willow's store.

05:29.529 --> 05:30.997
N O W.

05:30.997 --> 05:31.831
Now!

05:35.968 --> 05:36.803
Hello? Knox?

05:38.237 --> 05:40.340
You wanna have a
press conference?

05:40.340 --> 05:44.043
Is this more of your monkey
business or are you just lonely?

05:45.011 --> 05:47.413
Fine. I'll be there.

05:53.686 --> 05:56.989
Well what do you
think this is all about?

05:56.989 --> 06:00.893
Ah, they probably just
wanna go over the rules.

06:00.893 --> 06:05.732
Your attention please.

06:05.732 --> 06:10.436
Now, y'all maybe wondering
why a couple of grown men

06:10.436 --> 06:14.207
like Mr. Sneer and myself

06:14.207 --> 06:17.176
have entered this
skateboard race, huh?

06:18.244 --> 06:21.147
Well allow me to show you...

06:21.147 --> 06:22.148
The Knox Eliminator!

06:24.517 --> 06:27.754
Sit down, Knox! You're
blocking out the sun!

06:27.754 --> 06:30.189
Save the film for a real beauty.

06:30.189 --> 06:33.626
The Sneer-o-Sonic!

06:33.626 --> 06:37.063
Available soon in
stores everywhere.

06:37.063 --> 06:39.966
I believe I had
the floor, sir.

06:39.966 --> 06:43.202
The fact is, sir,
the Evergreen Forest

06:43.202 --> 06:45.905
is not big enough
for the both of us.

06:45.905 --> 06:47.340
And-
- Does this mean

06:47.340 --> 06:51.310
you're pulling out or just
planning to go on a diet, Knox?

06:51.310 --> 06:53.379
Neither.

06:53.379 --> 06:57.850
I propose we make things
a bit more interesting.

06:58.818 --> 07:01.154
The loser of this race

07:01.154 --> 07:04.323
will pull out of the
skateboard market.

07:06.225 --> 07:08.528
Knox! You've got a deal.

07:08.528 --> 07:09.896
Good.

07:09.896 --> 07:14.033
And now that business
is out the way,

07:14.033 --> 07:17.970
allow me to introduce my team.

07:17.970 --> 07:21.874
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Knox Knights!

07:29.415 --> 07:30.850
Excuse me,

07:30.850 --> 07:33.453
but aren't we forgetting
there's another team entered?

07:33.453 --> 07:34.287
Oh, uh...

07:36.222 --> 07:37.890
Hi hon...

07:37.890 --> 07:42.628
Mr. Willow! We have
a delivery for you!

07:42.628 --> 07:46.499
But if you're too busy
right now, we can wait.

07:46.499 --> 07:48.301
No problem, boys.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.703
I've been putting off
this job for years.

07:50.703 --> 07:52.738
Another few minutes
shouldn't matter.

07:52.738 --> 07:56.075
Do you have the latest
issue of Mud Man, Mr. Willow?

07:56.075 --> 07:58.244
Yep. Just came
in this morning.

07:59.512 --> 08:01.781
Let's go have a look, Lloyd!

08:01.781 --> 08:04.450
Hey, how about some help here?

08:05.885 --> 08:09.522
Oh it would be great if
we could buy this right now!

08:09.522 --> 08:11.157
Mud Man!

08:11.157 --> 08:13.559
Yeah, but with
what the boss pays us

08:13.559 --> 08:15.962
we'll have to wait
till next month!

08:15.962 --> 08:20.867
Hey, let's put it in the box
so nobody else will buy it.

08:20.867 --> 08:22.535
That's everything.

08:24.003 --> 08:26.839
Great. Just hang on till
I check out the paperwork.

08:28.608 --> 08:31.777
If I had a big
comic collection,

08:31.777 --> 08:33.746
they wouldn't be
treating me like this.

08:36.949 --> 08:39.752
The order's fine son, I
just wanted to check 'em to...

08:42.822 --> 08:46.559
Everyone's in
such a rush these days.

08:46.559 --> 08:49.128
Come on! !e wanna get going!

08:56.669 --> 09:00.172
Those Knox Knights
look pretty good, Cedric.

09:00.172 --> 09:02.575
Your pop could really
use our help, you know?

09:02.575 --> 09:04.243
Hey, what do you say

09:04.243 --> 09:07.613
we offer him our
skateboarding expertise?

09:08.714 --> 09:11.117
That's very
noble of you, Bert.

09:12.718 --> 09:16.589
Hose B is attached
to input valve C.

09:16.589 --> 09:18.591
Hi Pop, Bert and I want to-

09:18.591 --> 09:19.525
Cedric!

09:19.525 --> 09:20.993
Take a look at this, son.

09:20.993 --> 09:23.696
This is going to win that
race for me.

09:23.696 --> 09:27.500
My secret weapon, the
Sneer Stealth Bomber!

09:27.500 --> 09:28.968
It has everything.

09:28.968 --> 09:32.872
The latest technology, a
complete guidance system

09:32.872 --> 09:35.207
and titanium turbo thrusters!

09:35.207 --> 09:37.343
It's so powerful it
even comes equipped

09:37.343 --> 09:39.946
with an injection
seat and a parachute!

09:40.880 --> 09:42.949
Well, it's not exactly as-

09:42.949 --> 09:45.017
Very perceptive, son.

09:45.017 --> 09:47.553
It's much more
than a skateboard.

09:47.553 --> 09:49.822
Knox will never
know what hit him!

09:49.822 --> 09:54.560
Now what was it you wanted
to talk to me about, Son?

09:54.560 --> 09:56.062
Oh, nothing Pop.

09:58.297 --> 10:01.367
Two comics for
just this one? Sure.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.203
Ha! What a steal!

10:04.203 --> 10:06.739
Now I've got a complete set!

10:06.739 --> 10:08.207
That's nothing.

10:08.207 --> 10:09.542
I've got two complete sets
and the latest Mud Man issue.

10:14.246 --> 10:16.415
Wow! He really does!

10:16.415 --> 10:18.451
These are great!

10:18.451 --> 10:20.252
But where did you get them?

10:20.252 --> 10:21.320
Oh, I uh...

10:22.321 --> 10:23.823
found them.

10:23.823 --> 10:28.260
Nobody finds stuff like this,
now where did you get them?

10:28.260 --> 10:29.595
Yeah!

10:29.595 --> 10:32.431
Uh, well, someone
owed me a favor, see?

10:32.431 --> 10:36.802
And he knows this person
who knows someone who's uh,

10:36.802 --> 10:39.205
who's friends with someone else

10:39.205 --> 10:42.575
who is real good friends
with a guy who knows, uh...

10:42.575 --> 10:43.376
Mud Man.

10:44.810 --> 10:47.446
You know Mud Man?

10:47.446 --> 10:49.782
Oh sure.

10:49.782 --> 10:51.384
Why, the old mud slinger

10:51.384 --> 10:54.920
and I practically
share the same soap.

10:54.920 --> 10:58.424
I can get plenty more
comics, any old time I want.

10:58.424 --> 10:59.659
You can?

10:59.659 --> 11:01.794
Oh, and for free too.

11:01.794 --> 11:03.029
For free?

11:03.029 --> 11:06.799
Gee, could I borrow
this one to read?

11:06.799 --> 11:08.501
You could borrow mine.

11:08.501 --> 11:09.335
Well...

11:10.636 --> 11:12.805
Okay, but don't bend them.

11:14.073 --> 11:15.875
Hey! Listen to this.

11:15.875 --> 11:19.245
"For a limited time only,
enjoy all the sights

11:19.245 --> 11:22.948
and sounds of your favorite
superhero's hometown."

11:22.948 --> 11:26.419
Oh! A chance to see Mudville!

11:27.687 --> 11:29.155
Gee!

11:29.155 --> 11:32.591
And I know how we could
raise the cash to go!

11:34.026 --> 11:37.463
Talk to your friend and get
as many comics as you can.

11:37.463 --> 11:40.833
We can sell 'em at the
skateboard contest.

11:40.833 --> 11:42.468
Oh Lloyd!

11:42.468 --> 11:44.603
You've done it again!

11:44.603 --> 11:46.405
Yeah, I sure have...

11:48.641 --> 11:50.209
Wow.

11:50.209 --> 11:54.413
"Mud Man traps Freddy Fingers,
a dastardly small-time thief,

11:54.413 --> 11:57.917
on top of Megalopolis
City Hall."

11:57.917 --> 12:01.287
"Fingers will just have
to learn the hard way,

12:01.287 --> 12:03.122
that crime doesn't pay."

12:05.124 --> 12:08.427
Wow! Well that's
it, lights out boys.

Sorry.

Oh, things just aren't
going so good, that's all.

13:49.628 --> 13:51.430
Well, now I know what
they mean when they say

13:51.430 --> 13:55.367
skateboarding's
a downhill sport.

13:55.367 --> 13:58.103
Ah, Cedric things
aren't that bad.

13:58.103 --> 14:00.840
Sure we're up against some
pretty impressive competition,

14:00.840 --> 14:04.410
but we still have one
thing going for us.

14:04.410 --> 14:06.178
Oh? What's that?

14:06.178 --> 14:10.115
We know that's skateboard
course better than anyone!

14:10.115 --> 14:13.786
Ha, we have the home
field advantage.

14:13.786 --> 14:15.921
I guess you guys
didn't hear the news.

14:15.921 --> 14:17.690
Huh? What news?

14:17.690 --> 14:20.426
They moved the
course to Freen's Peak.

14:20.426 --> 14:21.760
Freen's Peak!.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.798
There goes the
whole field advantage

14:27.600 --> 14:30.202
Your friend set
to meet him here?

14:30.202 --> 14:33.939
Uh, yeah. Inside the store.

14:33.939 --> 14:36.909
Listen, there's something
I have to tell you...

14:37.943 --> 14:40.012
About the comics...

14:40.980 --> 14:42.581
What?

14:42.581 --> 14:46.051
Uh (laughs), some of
them are in wrappers.

14:46.051 --> 14:48.487
So? We'll take them out.

14:48.487 --> 14:51.891
Look, as soon as you get the
comics, bring them along.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.259
We're going to set up.

14:57.930 --> 15:00.666
Hello skateboard
fans everywhere!

15:00.666 --> 15:02.067
Dick Ermine here,

15:02.067 --> 15:05.571
broadcasting from the
Evergreen Skateboard Contest!

15:05.571 --> 15:07.039
Below me,

15:07.039 --> 15:09.475
I see the contestants going
through their final preparation.

15:10.676 --> 15:14.113
Remember, I don't
care what it takes.

15:14.113 --> 15:16.982
Get in front and stay in front.

15:16.982 --> 15:19.885
This way boys!

15:21.320 --> 15:26.125
And just what sort of
contraption is that, Sir?

15:27.559 --> 15:29.428
You can take a good look
at it in the winners circle.

15:29.428 --> 15:31.797
I'm kind of busy
right now, Knox.

15:31.797 --> 15:34.867
Don't forget to switch
at the halfway mark.

15:34.867 --> 15:39.738
Don't take your eyes off
the course, and don't lose!

15:39.738 --> 15:43.208
This looks like a
pretty tough course, Bert.

15:43.208 --> 15:44.843
Don't worry, Cedric.

15:44.843 --> 15:49.648
Look! I brought you
my lucky sweater.

15:49.648 --> 15:52.017
Gee, thanks Bert.

15:52.017 --> 15:54.453
How do you tell the difference?

15:54.453 --> 15:56.422
They're all lucky.

15:56.422 --> 15:59.558
And now, we'll look
like a real team.

15:59.558 --> 16:02.328
Yeah. The B team.

16:10.769 --> 16:12.271
Huh?

16:18.043 --> 16:20.612
I think we have a problem here.

16:25.384 --> 16:26.618
The race is away!

16:26.618 --> 16:29.989
The skaters blast away
from the starting line!

16:29.989 --> 16:32.624
And trouble has come
early to the Snare team.

16:32.624 --> 16:35.260
The Stealth Bomber
seems to stalled.

16:38.931 --> 16:41.700
The early leader seems
to be the Knox team!

16:41.700 --> 16:43.268
This could be the team to beat.

16:45.337 --> 16:47.006
The skaters are
approaching the water jump,

16:47.006 --> 16:49.842
the first of many obstacles
they must overcome.

16:52.644 --> 16:53.879
Whoa!

16:53.879 --> 16:57.249
Oh! Two
magnificent leaps!

16:57.249 --> 17:00.886
The Bomber has started, but
can he get back into this race?

17:00.886 --> 17:03.088
This should
slow things down a bit!

17:07.159 --> 17:09.328
Well, the Know
team seems rather confident,

17:09.328 --> 17:12.664
but the Bomber comes from
way back to grab the lead!

17:12.664 --> 17:14.600
He looks unbeatable!

17:14.600 --> 17:18.170
Sneer, you're
one slick operator!

17:18.170 --> 17:19.471
Oh no!

17:19.471 --> 17:20.305
Stop!

17:23.909 --> 17:26.311
Get back in the
race you fur ball!

17:26.311 --> 17:28.781
I've lost sight
of the contestants.

17:28.781 --> 17:30.816
Wait, here they come.

17:30.816 --> 17:32.317
We have a new leader!
The Knox team!

17:32.317 --> 17:35.387
Hanging on the second
place is Bert Raccoon.

17:35.387 --> 17:37.489
And in third, the Bomber!

17:37.489 --> 17:38.290
And...

17:39.425 --> 17:41.860
He seems to have
picked something up.

17:41.860 --> 17:43.962
It's Cyril Sneer!

17:43.962 --> 17:45.697
Pass him! Pass him!

17:50.369 --> 17:52.604
I've never seen
anything like this.

17:52.604 --> 17:54.740
A cloud bank seems
to have rolled in.

17:56.842 --> 17:59.611
Hit the fans!
We're losing ground!

18:02.314 --> 18:04.683
The cloud coverage
has dispersed,

18:04.683 --> 18:06.552
and the Bomber's making
up ground quickly,

18:06.552 --> 18:08.620
it's fighting for
first place again!

18:10.923 --> 18:12.357
Ooh!

18:12.357 --> 18:15.928
The Bomber, he's been plagued
by missed opportunities

18:15.928 --> 18:17.196
and misfortune.

18:18.564 --> 18:21.400
And the leaders switch
riders at the halfway point.

18:21.400 --> 18:23.268
Give it all ya got Cedric!

18:26.605 --> 18:31.610
Why, Mr. Sneer, you look beat.

18:32.344 --> 18:33.712
Not over yet, Knox!

18:33.712 --> 18:36.715
This is a race, not a
drive in the country!

18:36.715 --> 18:39.718
You've got to put the
pedal to the metal!

18:39.718 --> 18:44.623
Those fantastic deals on
comics should be here shortly!

18:44.623 --> 18:46.892
Oh you made it!

18:46.892 --> 18:48.193
Hey, where are the comics?

18:48.193 --> 18:51.396
I don't have them.

18:51.396 --> 18:52.664
What?

18:52.664 --> 18:56.935
I did something stupid.

18:56.935 --> 19:00.005
It's real bad.

19:06.545 --> 19:08.580
Cedric Sneer is
really giving the Knox team

19:08.580 --> 19:10.048
a run for their money.

19:10.048 --> 19:12.784
And here comes the Bomber,
now being ridden by...

19:12.784 --> 19:14.019
Cyril Sneer!

19:17.089 --> 19:19.191
Oh I can't
believe my eyes!

19:19.191 --> 19:21.927
The Bomber's gone the wrong way!

19:21.927 --> 19:25.597
But what a maneuver!
What showmanship!

19:25.597 --> 19:26.832
Good luck!

19:26.832 --> 19:28.333
Need more speed!

19:30.068 --> 19:31.203
Ha ha!

19:31.203 --> 19:33.772
The racers are
entering the Mogul Fear,

19:33.772 --> 19:36.008
the final obstacle
before the home stretch.

19:42.714 --> 19:44.316
Pop! Bail out!

19:44.316 --> 19:45.717
Good idea Son!

19:47.686 --> 19:49.354
Well, it looks like
this race is down

19:49.354 --> 19:51.590
to just two contestants.

19:51.590 --> 19:53.091
The Knox team is
still in the lead,

19:53.091 --> 19:55.460
but Cedric Sneer
seems to be gaining!

19:55.460 --> 19:56.295
Pop!

19:57.296 --> 19:58.664
Whoa!

19:58.664 --> 20:00.032
It looks
like this race is over

20:00.032 --> 20:01.733
except for the cherry!

20:01.733 --> 20:03.635
What are you doing Son?

20:03.635 --> 20:05.270
Finishing the race, Pop!

20:05.270 --> 20:07.372
The Knox team is
heading for the finish line.

20:07.372 --> 20:09.107
He should easily-

20:09.107 --> 20:11.343
Cedric Sneer has
come outta nowhere!

20:11.343 --> 20:12.644
He's back in the race!

20:12.644 --> 20:14.179
He takes the lead!

20:14.179 --> 20:15.981
And the ribbon!

20:15.981 --> 20:17.683
Cedric Sneer has won!

20:20.118 --> 20:22.020
Cedric! We won!

20:22.020 --> 20:24.256
Oh, that was some finish.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.858
It was incredible!

20:26.858 --> 20:29.261
Why weren't you
on the Sneer team?

20:29.261 --> 20:32.264
You should have told me you
could do all that stuff, Son.

20:32.264 --> 20:33.999
Where did you learn those moves?

20:33.999 --> 20:37.903
I thought our bacon was fried,
but you jumped that creek.

20:37.903 --> 20:40.439
We are all
surrounded by familiar sights

20:40.439 --> 20:44.710
and sounds, but once in a
while, we make a real discovery.

20:44.710 --> 20:47.512
Sometimes the most
incredible things are those

20:47.512 --> 20:49.448
that have always been there.

20:50.716 --> 20:51.850
Keep working!

20:51.850 --> 20:53.885
Yeah!

20:53.885 --> 20:56.388
And if you ever pull
another stunt like this,

20:56.388 --> 20:58.357
you're on your own!

20:58.357 --> 21:00.525
Gee, thanks guys.

21:00.525 --> 21:04.129
And don't worry, I've
cleaned up my act.

21:04.129 --> 21:06.999
Almost.

21:06.999 --> 21:10.235
What a board, Cedric!

21:10.235 --> 21:12.004
Yeah, I can't
wait to try it out.

21:13.205 --> 21:17.242
Let's settle this once
and for all, Mr. Sneer.

21:17.242 --> 21:18.810
My pleasure, Knox.

21:18.810 --> 21:20.746
I hate unfinished business.

21:20.746 --> 21:22.814
Geronimo!

21:24.149 --> 21:28.387
Hey Bert, maybe we
should try another hill?

21:28.387 --> 21:30.122
- Look out!
- Out out of my way!

21:30.122 --> 21:32.157
- Move over!
- Back up!

21:32.157 --> 21:35.394
Yeah, a quieter one.

21:35.394 --> 21:39.164
Last one to the
finish line is a rotten egg!
