<i>Human touch.</i>

00:36.028 --> 00:38.865
<i>Our first form
of communication.</i>

00:39.397 --> 00:41.866
<i>Safety, security, comfort,</i>

00:41.868 --> 00:44.737
<i>all in the gentle caress
of a finger.</i>

00:45.071 --> 00:47.940
<i>Or the brush of lips
on a soft cheek.</i>

00:48.741 --> 00:50.610
<i>It connects us
when we're happy,</i>

00:52.444 --> 00:54.747

00:56.816 --> 00:59.018
<i>excites us
in times of passion</i>

01:01.821 --> 01:03.022
<i>and love.</i>

01:04.757 --> 01:07.491
<i>We need that touch
from the one we love</i>

01:07.493 --> 01:09.762
<i>almost as much
as we need air to breathe.</i>

01:11.396 --> 01:14.667
<i>But I never understood
the importance of touch.</i>

01:15.768 --> 01:17.069
<i>His touch.</i>

01:20.606 --> 01:22.407
<i>Until I couldn't have it.</i>

01:44.163 --> 01:45.930
Oh!

01:45.932 --> 01:47.665
Oh, yeah.

01:47.667 --> 01:49.434
Oh, yeah. This one's perfect.

01:51.704 --> 01:53.604
Actually, though,
the tan lines
might be incredible.

01:53.606 --> 01:56.173
Oh, my gosh. That doesn't even
cover half your boob.

02:00.046 --> 02:01.512
This is actually cute.

02:01.514 --> 02:02.847
that's actually really cute.

02:02.849 --> 02:04.181
Let me see.

02:04.183 --> 02:05.115
I like that.

02:05.117 --> 02:06.717
Oh, yeah, that's actually
really pretty.

02:06.719 --> 02:08.619
But I can't tell,
is it too trampy

02:08.621 --> 02:10.487
or not trampy enough?

02:10.489 --> 02:11.490
Hello!

02:11.991 --> 02:13.123
Are you with us?

02:13.125 --> 02:14.658
Okay, guess what.

02:14.660 --> 02:16.527
Taylor and Mason
are meeting us

02:16.529 --> 02:17.864
at the airport in the morning.

02:18.164 --> 02:19.530
What's that face?

02:19.532 --> 02:20.731
Oh, my God!

02:20.733 --> 02:23.033
I know. I know, I know!

02:23.035 --> 02:24.835
Dude,
Mason and Brooke broke up.

02:24.837 --> 02:26.570
No, they didn't.

02:26.572 --> 02:28.138
Oh, my God! Maya!

02:28.140 --> 02:30.040
You're gonna do it!

02:31.043 --> 02:33.012
I wish I could be there
to see that in person.

02:35.581 --> 02:37.615
Just sucks
that you planned it this year

02:37.617 --> 02:38.618
and you don't even get to go.

02:40.086 --> 02:41.386
Well,

02:42.622 --> 02:45.623
you can just Photoshop me in
with your fancy editing apps.

02:45.625 --> 02:46.490
What are you talking about?

02:46.492 --> 02:47.457
You know
what I'm talking about.

02:47.459 --> 02:48.259
Why are you laughing?
No, I don't.

02:48.261 --> 02:49.894
The one
where you get your pimples

02:49.896 --> 02:51.629
and your little fake blush.

02:51.631 --> 02:52.763
Shut up.

02:52.765 --> 02:54.765
The lashes! Your lashes
aren't that long in real life.

02:54.767 --> 02:55.833
You guys
are so annoying.

02:55.835 --> 02:57.803
Okay, come on.
Thank you for the burgers.

02:58.804 --> 03:01.572
Honestly, you guys
are gonna have so much fun.

03:01.574 --> 03:02.773
Okay?

03:02.775 --> 03:03.941
Bye. I love you.

03:03.943 --> 03:05.042
I love you more.

03:05.044 --> 03:06.176
I love you.

03:06.178 --> 03:07.745
Miss you. Bye.

03:07.747 --> 03:09.713
Mwah. Use protection.

03:09.715 --> 03:11.117
Thanks, Mom.

03:58.998 --> 04:01.832
So, I am back
in the hospital again

04:01.834 --> 04:03.067
for another tune-up.

04:03.069 --> 04:05.569
I need a few more rounds
of antibiotics

04:05.571 --> 04:06.937
to get over
this little sore throat

04:06.939 --> 04:08.105
that I've been...

04:08.107 --> 04:09.640
Hi, Barb!

04:09.642 --> 04:10.876
Sore throat?

04:11.110 --> 04:13.577
Right, with a 102 fever?

04:13.579 --> 04:15.012
I've had worse.
Say hi!

04:15.014 --> 04:16.579
Stella, get that thing
out of my face.

04:16.582 --> 04:18.214
You're looking good!

04:18.216 --> 04:21.250
Stella will be right back
after we get her all set up.

04:21.253 --> 04:22.955
You heard the boss lady.

04:25.558 --> 04:27.691
I think this is her best work.

04:31.030 --> 04:32.229
Wow.

04:32.231 --> 04:34.832
Wow. A lot's changed
in the last six months.

04:34.834 --> 04:35.899
Yep.

04:35.901 --> 04:37.234
He's due in March.

04:37.236 --> 04:38.836
Bend your arm, please.

04:38.838 --> 04:39.903
What room's Poe in?

04:39.905 --> 04:41.005
310.

04:43.175 --> 04:45.511
And open up.

04:48.047 --> 04:49.181
All right.

04:53.753 --> 04:55.185
You are all set.

04:55.187 --> 04:56.587
I'll see you in a bit.

04:56.589 --> 04:57.921
Thank you, Julie.

05:00.659 --> 05:01.792
Wow.

05:01.794 --> 05:03.127
Are you sure this is okay?

05:03.129 --> 05:05.162
I will still
be monitoring you.

05:05.164 --> 05:07.698
And, yes, it's okay.

05:07.700 --> 05:09.266
What would I do without you?

05:09.268 --> 05:11.168
You'd die.

05:12.605 --> 05:14.004
That's true.

05:14.006 --> 05:16.040
So, Barb is letting me keep

05:16.042 --> 05:18.275
my med cart
in my room this time.

05:18.277 --> 05:20.077
And she left me
a bunch of pills,

05:20.079 --> 05:22.246
some G-Juice.

05:22.248 --> 05:24.982
Yum!
That's the liquid nutrition

05:24.984 --> 05:26.283
that goes
straight to my stomach

05:26.285 --> 05:27.718
through my G-tube.

05:27.720 --> 05:29.920
So, to any of you girls
out there

05:29.922 --> 05:32.222
wishing you could eat
5,000 calories a day

05:32.224 --> 05:33.824
and not gain a pound,

05:33.826 --> 05:35.594
I'll trade you any day.

05:36.062 --> 05:40.130
Today I'll probably
be reorganizing this thing

05:40.132 --> 05:44.234
because as many of you know,
I'm slightly anal.

05:44.236 --> 05:47.306
By slightly anal,
I mean clinically OCD.

05:47.873 --> 05:49.740
So, peace.

05:49.742 --> 05:50.841
Bye, guys.

07:29.842 --> 07:31.343
New baby upstairs.

07:31.810 --> 07:33.412
Meet me in 15.

07:37.983 --> 07:39.051
Hi, Cynthia.

07:39.318 --> 07:40.686
Hi, Stella.

07:41.887 --> 07:42.888
Hi.

07:57.303 --> 07:58.936
I've already clocked
the nurse's schedule,

07:58.938 --> 08:00.470
so unless you plant your ass
on that call button,

08:00.472 --> 08:01.939
no one's gonna bother you
for, like, an hour.

08:01.941 --> 08:04.841
Hey. I gotta sleep
on that bed, okay?

08:04.843 --> 08:07.010
Wow. I mean,
we're not animals.

08:07.012 --> 08:09.012
Don't worry, it's not even
gonna take that long.

08:09.014 --> 08:11.114
Hey!
Whatchu talkin' about, Willis?

08:30.102 --> 08:31.203
Okay, bye.

09:10.610 --> 09:13.043
Saw you moving in your stuff.

09:13.045 --> 09:14.311
It was, uh...

09:14.313 --> 09:15.914
There was a lot of it.

09:16.315 --> 09:18.417
Are you gonna be here
for a while?

09:20.520 --> 09:21.820
Hello?

09:25.024 --> 09:26.225
Oh.

09:27.393 --> 09:28.794
You're deaf.

09:29.461 --> 09:32.029
Shouldn't you be
procuring your room

09:32.031 --> 09:33.397
for your guests?

09:33.399 --> 09:35.465
You rent by the hour or what?

09:35.467 --> 09:37.901
So, that was you
lurking in the hall.

09:37.903 --> 09:40.404
Mmm, I don't lurk,
and you followed me here.

09:40.406 --> 09:42.406
I wanted to introduce myself,

09:42.408 --> 09:45.042
but that little attitude
of yours...

09:45.044 --> 09:46.644
Let me guess.
You're the kind of guy

09:46.646 --> 09:47.645
that ignores the rules

09:47.647 --> 09:50.049
'cause it makes you feel
in control. Am I right?

09:50.349 --> 09:51.582
You're not wrong.

09:51.584 --> 09:52.885
You think that's cute?

09:53.085 --> 09:54.820
Do you think it's cute?

09:55.921 --> 09:58.288
Letting your friends
borrow your room for sex

09:58.290 --> 09:59.590
is disgusting, so, no.

09:59.592 --> 10:00.891
You don't like sex?

10:00.893 --> 10:02.394
No, I like

10:03.228 --> 10:05.331
sex. I like sex.

10:06.398 --> 10:07.498
Sex is fine.

10:09.435 --> 10:10.568
Fine isn't exactly
a ringing endorsement,

10:10.570 --> 10:12.570
but I'll take some common
ground where I can get it.

10:12.572 --> 10:14.104
We have nothing in common.

10:14.106 --> 10:15.140
Ooh, that's cold.

10:16.942 --> 10:18.944
What...
What are you doing up here?

10:19.512 --> 10:22.547
Six feet at all times.
You both know the rules.

10:22.549 --> 10:24.649
Will, get back to your room.

10:24.651 --> 10:25.618
There you go.

10:26.285 --> 10:29.589
A little name for
your psychological profile.

10:29.988 --> 10:31.323
I'm Will Newman.

10:31.624 --> 10:33.025
And you are?

10:33.225 --> 10:34.293
Deaf.

10:35.427 --> 10:36.627
Stella, thank you
for putting your mask back on.

10:36.629 --> 10:38.263
Stella.

10:39.298 --> 10:40.899
You need to lighten up.

10:41.534 --> 10:42.868
It's just life.

10:43.268 --> 10:45.404
It'll be over
before you know it.

10:52.479 --> 10:54.046
So, he's a CFer?

10:55.214 --> 10:57.182
B. cepacia.

10:57.717 --> 11:01.186
Part of a new drug trial
for Cevaflomalin.

11:02.354 --> 11:04.923
You contract that
and you can...

11:05.257 --> 11:08.160
You can kiss the possibility
of new lungs goodbye.

11:09.228 --> 11:12.131
There's no coming back
from that bacteria.

11:12.665 --> 11:14.400
Stay away.

11:40.058 --> 11:41.659
<i>Hello, world.</i>

11:41.661 --> 11:44.261
Okay, AffloVest
for 30 more minutes,

11:44.263 --> 11:45.262
then you're all set.

11:45.264 --> 11:47.498
You need anything else
before I hit the road?

11:47.500 --> 11:49.700
Chocolate pudding for two?

11:49.702 --> 11:51.536
Oh, so, what?
I'm room service now?

11:51.538 --> 11:54.104
Gotta take
advantage of the perks.

11:59.111 --> 12:00.112
All right.

12:01.514 --> 12:03.714
Good girl, good girl.

12:03.716 --> 12:06.018
All right, good.
Right.

12:06.351 --> 12:08.351
Right, sweetie.

12:08.353 --> 12:09.453
I'll see you tomorrow.

12:09.455 --> 12:10.521
Bye, Barb.

12:10.523 --> 12:11.524
Okay.

12:21.200 --> 12:23.333
<i>Like
all kids with cystic fibrosis,</i>

12:23.335 --> 12:24.502
<i>I was born terminal,</i>

12:24.504 --> 12:28.438
<i>which doesn't necessarily mean
I'm gonna die tomorrow,</i>

12:28.440 --> 12:29.674
<i>but I could die tomorrow.</i>

12:29.676 --> 12:31.107
<i>Anyone could die tomorrow.</i>

12:31.109 --> 12:32.477
<i>I just have
a little bit less time</i>

12:32.479 --> 12:33.511
<i>than everyone else.</i>

12:33.513 --> 12:38.081
<i>My lungs are at about
50% function right now.</i>

12:38.083 --> 12:39.349
<i>So at this rate,</i>

12:39.351 --> 12:41.686
<i>Dr. Hamid says
that I'll need a transplant</i>

12:41.688 --> 12:44.256
<i>by the time
I'm a junior in high school.</i>

12:45.190 --> 12:47.125
<i>That'll be fun.</i>

12:47.694 --> 12:49.596
<i>Hi, guys! Shh!</i>

12:50.429 --> 12:51.696
<i>We're at the NICU</i>

12:51.698 --> 12:53.564
<i>because I'm obsessed
with babies.</i>

12:53.566 --> 12:55.232
<i>And Barb...</i>

12:55.234 --> 12:57.702
<i>The beautiful Barb
is giving me permission</i>

12:57.704 --> 12:59.604
<i>to come in here by myself now.</i>

12:59.606 --> 13:02.740
<i>Cystic fibrosis, as you know,
is a genetic disease</i>

13:02.742 --> 13:05.843
<i>that basically makes my body
produce a shit ton of mucus.</i>

13:05.845 --> 13:09.246
<i>Fun fact, I have to be
extremely careful</i>

13:09.248 --> 13:10.648
<i>around other people with CF.</i>

13:10.650 --> 13:11.816
<i>The rule is that we're not</i>

13:11.818 --> 13:13.618
<i>supposed to get
within six feet</i>

13:13.620 --> 13:15.085
<i>because we could end up</i>

13:15.087 --> 13:16.419
<i>catching
each other's bacteria.</i>

13:16.421 --> 13:18.856
<i>A lot of people
don't realize that new lungs</i>

13:18.858 --> 13:21.759
<i>generally only last
about five years,</i>

13:21.761 --> 13:26.263
<i>which is okay actually
because most of us</i>

13:26.265 --> 13:28.231
<i>are just trying to stay alive
long enough</i>

13:28.233 --> 13:30.166
<i>for a new treatment
to come out.</i>

13:31.638 --> 13:34.471
<i>Just chilling here
in my new AffloVest,</i>

13:34.473 --> 13:35.640
<i>which is really cool</i>

13:35.642 --> 13:38.408
<i>because now I don't have to be
hooked up to the wall,</i>

13:38.410 --> 13:39.442
<i>which obviously I'm not</i>

13:39.444 --> 13:41.746
<i>because I'm hanging
upside down on my bed.</i>

13:42.815 --> 13:44.347
<i>This is actually good</i>

13:44.349 --> 13:46.316
<i>for getting the mucus up
and stuff.</i>

13:46.318 --> 13:47.618
<i>I know, cute, right?</i>

14:09.709 --> 14:10.743
<i>Dang, girl.</i>

14:11.410 --> 14:12.612
<i>You look worn.</i>

14:13.245 --> 14:14.313
<i>Who is he?</i>

14:14.714 --> 14:16.379
<i>Is it anyone I know?</i>

14:18.551 --> 14:20.252
<i>What'd you get?</i>

14:23.288 --> 14:24.254
<i>What?</i>

14:24.256 --> 14:27.157
Are those truffles?
How'd you get truffles?

14:27.159 --> 14:28.593
<i>Oh, you gotta
bring them with, sister.</i>

14:28.595 --> 14:29.596
Wow.

14:31.396 --> 14:33.800
Look at how spicy
that food cart is.

14:34.232 --> 14:35.365
<i>I'm impressed.</i>

14:35.367 --> 14:36.934
<i>All right,
let's talk about me.</i>

14:36.936 --> 14:39.539
I'm single!

14:40.372 --> 14:41.706
You broke up with Michael?

14:41.708 --> 14:43.509
<i>Maybe he broke up with me.</i>

14:43.743 --> 14:44.809
Did he?

14:44.811 --> 14:46.178
It was mutual.

14:47.480 --> 14:48.679
No, it wasn't.

14:48.681 --> 14:51.849
<i>Why? You actually
really liked him.</i>

14:51.851 --> 14:53.820
<i>And I thought
he was gonna be the one.</i>

14:54.286 --> 14:55.755
He obviously isn't.

14:58.423 --> 14:59.659
<i>Screw him anyway, right?</i>

14:59.892 --> 15:01.792
At least you got to do that.

15:03.896 --> 15:05.228
Poe?

15:11.269 --> 15:12.371
Poe?

15:12.905 --> 15:14.304
Poe, you okay?

15:15.675 --> 15:16.909
Choking, 310.

15:20.245 --> 15:21.879
I'm sorry, Julie.

15:21.881 --> 15:23.748
My leg hit the call button.

15:23.750 --> 15:25.485
You scared us, Poe.

15:25.852 --> 15:28.855
Yeah, try chewing next time.

15:29.589 --> 15:30.723
Here, Stella.

15:32.391 --> 15:34.625
Enjoy your truffles, asshole.

15:36.829 --> 15:38.598
And please be careful.

15:39.297 --> 15:40.931
I love you, Stella.

15:42.502 --> 15:43.834
Phase one clinical trials

15:43.836 --> 15:45.335
only started
only 18 months ago,

15:45.337 --> 15:47.270
so we need to be patient

15:47.272 --> 15:49.607
and Will needs to help us
with that.

15:49.609 --> 15:52.375
The risk of cross infection
will be even higher now, so...

15:52.377 --> 15:55.278
Don't cough
on any other CFers.

15:55.280 --> 15:57.815
Well, don't get close enough
to touch them

15:57.817 --> 15:59.819
for their safety and yours.

16:00.252 --> 16:02.855
Six feet at all times.
I got it.

16:05.290 --> 16:08.628
Will, in order for this
to work,

16:08.961 --> 16:11.196
you need to keep up
with your regimen.

16:15.601 --> 16:17.537
Okay, I will see you soon.

16:48.634 --> 16:50.000
You're wearing
the bathing suit!

16:51.871 --> 16:52.903
<i>Hi!</i>

16:52.905 --> 16:56.507
Oh, I'm officially jealous.
That looks so fun!

16:56.509 --> 16:58.576
<i>We miss you!</i>

16:58.578 --> 16:59.710
I miss you, too!

16:59.712 --> 17:01.781
<i>You have
any cute boy visitors?</i>

17:02.615 --> 17:04.382
No. No. He's not cute.

17:04.650 --> 17:05.651
<i>What?</i>

17:06.351 --> 17:07.550
<i>Boy?</i>

17:07.553 --> 17:09.520
What?

17:10.589 --> 17:12.724
<i>Show us! Show us!</i>

17:57.670 --> 17:58.536
What are you doing?

17:58.538 --> 18:00.540
Do you have a death wish
or something?

18:00.973 --> 18:02.041
Hey!

18:02.440 --> 18:03.974
My lungs are toast, okay?

18:03.976 --> 18:08.413
Can you just let me enjoy
this view while I can?

18:09.715 --> 18:12.516
Do you know how lucky
you are to be here?

18:12.518 --> 18:14.720
To be a part of
this drug trial?

18:15.988 --> 18:17.824
How do you know
about my drug trial?

18:18.858 --> 18:20.493
You been asking about me?

18:20.760 --> 18:21.894
Ugh.

18:23.095 --> 18:24.864
If you don't care,

18:25.665 --> 18:27.033
then leave.

18:27.733 --> 18:29.099
Give your spot
to someone else.

18:29.101 --> 18:31.971
Someone that wants it,
that wants to live.

18:36.108 --> 18:37.375
Okay.

18:39.812 --> 18:41.645
What are you doing?
Will?

18:43.716 --> 18:45.482
Will, stop, please!

18:45.484 --> 18:47.450
Please get down now!

18:47.452 --> 18:49.720
Will, stop!
Oh, my God!

18:53.759 --> 18:54.794
God!

18:55.728 --> 18:56.863
Relax!

19:01.567 --> 19:02.635
Fine.

19:04.136 --> 19:05.638
Stay up here then.

19:06.973 --> 19:09.008
Come on. It was a joke.

19:09.441 --> 19:11.077
Hey, it was a joke.

20:02.728 --> 20:03.996
Damn it!

20:26.686 --> 20:28.953
Where's your med cart,
and your pills,

20:28.955 --> 20:31.055
and why's your AffloVest
on the floor?

20:31.057 --> 20:33.192
Can... Can I see your regimen?

20:34.093 --> 20:37.663
Uh... Not that it's
any of your business...

20:45.871 --> 20:47.707
Is this... What?

20:49.208 --> 20:50.274
Why would...

20:50.276 --> 20:52.209
Is this what an aneurysm
looks like?

20:52.211 --> 20:54.613
Why? Ugh!

20:54.880 --> 20:56.714
Look, I get that you have
some kind of

20:56.716 --> 20:58.215
save-the-world hero complex
going on,

20:58.217 --> 20:59.783
but can you leave me
out of it?

20:59.785 --> 21:00.951
These meds are not optional.

21:00.953 --> 21:01.819
Yeah, that's probably why

21:01.821 --> 21:03.155
they keep shoving them
down my throat.

21:03.589 --> 21:05.091
You're making me crazy.

21:11.297 --> 21:13.165
Hey.

21:14.633 --> 21:15.801
Stella, come on!

21:17.336 --> 21:18.738
Six feet!

21:38.858 --> 21:40.858
I need you
to follow your regimen

21:40.860 --> 21:43.062
strictly and completely,
please.

21:44.130 --> 21:45.195
Why don't...

21:45.197 --> 21:48.298
Why don't you tell me
what's going on, actually?

21:48.300 --> 21:51.969
Talk to me. I'm not gonna make
any jokes or laugh.

21:53.839 --> 21:56.108
I have control issues.

21:57.143 --> 22:00.344
And I need to know
that things are in order,

22:00.346 --> 22:02.312
and I know that you're
not doing your treatments

22:02.314 --> 22:05.115
and it's really,
really messing me up.

22:05.117 --> 22:08.018
Okay, I wanna help you.

22:08.020 --> 22:09.021
I do.

22:11.057 --> 22:13.657
I don't even know how to do
what you're asking me to.

22:13.659 --> 22:14.825
That's bullshit!

22:14.827 --> 22:17.027
That's bullshit!
All CFers know

22:17.029 --> 22:18.095
how to administer
their own treatments.

22:18.097 --> 22:20.130
We're practically doctors
by the time we're 12.

22:20.132 --> 22:21.365
Are you serious?

22:21.367 --> 22:23.634
Am I actually messing you up?

22:23.636 --> 22:24.637
Yes.

22:26.238 --> 22:27.239
All right.

22:28.240 --> 22:29.241
I'll help you.

22:30.042 --> 22:31.343
But if I do,

22:34.280 --> 22:35.748
what's in it for me?

22:37.349 --> 22:38.715
No, not like...

22:38.717 --> 22:41.754
I... I wanna draw you.

22:42.788 --> 22:43.921
No.

22:43.923 --> 22:45.858
Why not? I'm serious.

22:46.225 --> 22:47.226
No.

22:52.064 --> 22:53.099
Okay.

22:54.366 --> 22:55.701
Then no deal.

22:56.902 --> 22:59.236
You really can't practice just
a little bit of discipline

22:59.238 --> 23:00.871
even to save your own life?

23:00.873 --> 23:03.674
Stella, nothing is going to
save our lives.

23:03.676 --> 23:05.744
We're breathing borrowed air.

23:06.879 --> 23:07.847
Enjoy it.

23:22.962 --> 23:24.128
Fine.

23:24.130 --> 23:26.230
But I'm not posing
for hours on end.

23:26.232 --> 23:28.031
And your regimen,
we're doing it my way.

23:28.033 --> 23:29.166
Okay, the first thing
you're gonna do

23:29.168 --> 23:30.769
is get a med cart
in your room. Deal?

23:32.771 --> 23:33.772
Deal.

23:34.073 --> 23:35.107
Shake on it?

23:39.479 --> 23:40.746
Funny.

23:54.093 --> 23:56.729
Shit!

23:59.398 --> 24:01.901
Oh, God, no, no, no!

24:03.135 --> 24:04.136
Hey.

24:06.805 --> 24:08.005
You missed the show.

24:08.007 --> 24:09.840
Yeah.
You doing stunts in there?

24:09.842 --> 24:11.975
Well, there's no better place
to break a leg.

24:11.977 --> 24:13.145
That's fair.

24:13.345 --> 24:14.380
I'm Will.

24:17.917 --> 24:18.951
I'm Poe.

24:20.386 --> 24:21.987
B. cepacia.

24:23.022 --> 24:24.356
Damn, that's rough.

24:25.457 --> 24:26.458
Yeah.

24:27.259 --> 24:29.359
So, no lung transplant for me.

24:29.361 --> 24:30.928
When did you contract it?

24:30.930 --> 24:33.397
About eight months ago now.
It colonized so quickly.

24:33.399 --> 24:36.035
I was on the transplant list
one minute and then...

24:40.206 --> 24:42.472
I'm sure that attitude
is what's giving Stella fits.

24:42.474 --> 24:44.074
Yeah, what's up with that?

24:44.076 --> 24:46.544
She told me that she has
control issues or something.

24:46.546 --> 24:48.445
Call it what you want,
she's got her shit together.

24:48.447 --> 24:50.249
She definitely keeps me
in line.

24:50.449 --> 24:51.817
So, uh,

24:52.885 --> 24:54.220
have you two...

24:55.888 --> 24:58.090
No.

24:58.324 --> 24:59.890
No, no, no.

24:59.892 --> 25:02.428
I've known that girl
since I was, like, seven.

25:02.928 --> 25:04.895
I don't know, man.

25:04.897 --> 25:06.296
Sounds like you love her.

25:06.298 --> 25:07.931
Of course, I love her.

25:07.933 --> 25:10.200
So, why haven't you done
anything about it?

25:10.202 --> 25:11.370
Because

25:12.238 --> 25:13.872
she's not a he.

25:19.278 --> 25:21.345
Don't worry.
I don't like white boys.

25:30.889 --> 25:32.523
Dr. Hamid said
that you suddenly

25:32.525 --> 25:34.994
wanna be responsible
for your own regimen.

25:35.595 --> 25:37.497
Don't make me regret this.

25:48.340 --> 25:49.840
Did you wipe everything down?

25:49.842 --> 25:52.512
Yes. This wasn't
my idea, you know?

25:55.314 --> 25:56.947
Are we still clear?

25:56.949 --> 25:58.450
Yes. Hurry up.

25:59.519 --> 26:01.153
I'm almost done.

26:36.221 --> 26:38.623
Okay. Your med cart's
all set up.

26:38.625 --> 26:40.558
I built an app
for chronic illnesses.

26:40.560 --> 26:41.925
It'll alert you when to do

26:41.927 --> 26:43.126
your treatments,
and take your pills...

26:43.128 --> 26:44.662
Built an app?

26:44.664 --> 26:46.198
Like you built it?

26:46.633 --> 26:47.833
Surprise.

26:48.467 --> 26:50.000
It's pretty simple.

26:50.002 --> 26:51.437
You should be able
to figure it out.

27:22.434 --> 27:23.501
<i>Okay, Stella.</i>

27:23.503 --> 27:25.670
Don't tell me that
the one time you're interested

27:25.672 --> 27:27.938
in some guy, he's a CFer.

27:27.940 --> 27:30.042
I just helped him set up
his med cart.

27:30.275 --> 27:32.442
That... That's it.
That's all!

27:32.444 --> 27:34.044
I know you, Stella.

27:34.046 --> 27:36.215
Organizing a med cart
is like foreplay.

27:39.686 --> 27:41.954
They're called manners!

27:55.000 --> 27:57.169
<i>Are you doing your AffloVest?</i>

27:58.137 --> 27:59.238
Yeah.

27:59.672 --> 28:00.673
<i>Show me.</i>

28:01.608 --> 28:03.676
I can't.
I'm half-naked.

28:04.176 --> 28:07.010
You're supposed to be doing
your AffloVest right now,

28:07.012 --> 28:08.180
and did you take your Creon?

28:08.581 --> 28:11.551
Are those the suppositories?

28:13.553 --> 28:14.652
Okay.

28:14.654 --> 28:16.219
<i>Okay, I can't trust you,</i>

28:16.221 --> 28:18.388
<i>so this is how
it's gonna work.</i>

28:18.390 --> 28:20.023
<i>We're gonna do
our treatments together</i>

28:20.025 --> 28:21.759
so that way I know you're
actually doing them.

28:21.761 --> 28:23.026
Okay?

28:23.028 --> 28:24.361
<i>Always looking for ways</i>

28:24.363 --> 28:26.396
<i>to spend more time with me,
aren't you, Stella?</i>

28:26.398 --> 28:27.399
Bye.

28:28.568 --> 28:30.969
I've been doing this
since I was a little kid.

28:33.205 --> 28:35.071
So you just pour them all
in the pudding

28:35.073 --> 28:36.774
and stir it around.
Are you doing that?

29:28.360 --> 29:29.361
Good night.

29:34.366 --> 29:36.435
The Divorce Diet
doesn't look good on you, Mom.

29:37.236 --> 29:38.503
What are you talking about?

29:38.505 --> 29:40.470
You're too thin.
Dad needs a bath.

29:40.472 --> 29:41.608
You guys are stealing my look.

29:42.241 --> 29:44.009
I'm stealing your look?

29:44.443 --> 29:45.375
Mmm-hmm.

29:45.377 --> 29:47.177
Okay, maybe I need this
more than you do.

29:47.179 --> 29:49.312
No!

29:49.314 --> 29:50.483
Oh, my God!

29:51.383 --> 29:52.750
How did that happen?

29:52.752 --> 29:54.284
How did it happen?

29:54.286 --> 29:55.452
Oh, man!

29:55.454 --> 29:56.789
Give me napkins.

29:57.490 --> 29:59.391
Aw, here, honey.

30:18.343 --> 30:19.746
I love you so much.

30:21.881 --> 30:24.416
I know.
I love you, too.

30:25.885 --> 30:28.220
I don't know
what I'd do without you.

30:37.396 --> 30:38.596
How does it feel?

30:38.598 --> 30:40.533
Not great.

30:42.134 --> 30:43.568
Let's try some Bactroban,

30:43.570 --> 30:44.802
see how it looks
in a day or two.

30:44.804 --> 30:46.469
Maybe we can clear it up, huh?

30:48.741 --> 30:50.375
Oh. I'll be at the gym.

30:51.243 --> 30:52.442
Thanks, Doc!

30:57.784 --> 31:00.185
Hey, you know, this sucks.

31:00.419 --> 31:04.356
When does this deal of ours
become mutually beneficial?

31:05.324 --> 31:06.924
I've done everything
you've asked

31:06.926 --> 31:09.328
with no return
on my investment.

31:10.462 --> 31:12.697
You really wanna draw me
after we work out?

31:12.699 --> 31:14.199
Yeah.

31:14.601 --> 31:15.602
No.

31:15.802 --> 31:18.836
I'm gross, and sweaty,
and smell.

31:18.838 --> 31:20.871
"My hair is dirty.

31:20.873 --> 31:22.840
"I'm too tired.

31:22.842 --> 31:24.677
"My med cart is messy."

31:24.877 --> 31:26.111
Fine.

31:26.746 --> 31:29.181
I'll sweat harder then.
Just for you.

31:30.382 --> 31:32.315
I'm going to draw that sweat.

31:41.961 --> 31:43.462
What's that?

31:44.229 --> 31:45.565
My to-do list.

31:45.898 --> 31:47.500
To-do list?

31:47.934 --> 31:51.434
That's pretty old-fashioned
for someone that builds apps.

31:51.436 --> 31:53.269
Yeah, well,
the app doesn't give me

31:53.271 --> 31:55.440
the satisfaction of doing

31:55.808 --> 31:57.142
that.

32:01.446 --> 32:03.650
What else is on
that to-do list of yours?

32:04.216 --> 32:05.950
My master list
or my daily list?

32:05.952 --> 32:07.920
Yeah, of course
you have two lists.

32:08.721 --> 32:10.657
The master list.
That's the big stuff, right?

32:11.891 --> 32:12.923
Okay.

32:12.925 --> 32:15.826
Volunteer in an important
political campaign.

32:15.828 --> 32:16.794
Done.

32:16.796 --> 32:18.729
Study all the works of
William Shakespeare.

32:18.731 --> 32:19.732
Done.

32:20.833 --> 32:22.465
Share everything I know
about CF with other people.

32:22.467 --> 32:23.734
That's my YouTube page.

32:23.736 --> 32:26.839
So, your plan
is to die really smart

32:27.305 --> 32:28.572
so that you can join

32:28.574 --> 32:30.242
the debate team of the dead
or something?

32:30.643 --> 32:32.679
What about
traveling the world?

32:38.851 --> 32:40.918
Learn to play piano.

32:40.920 --> 32:42.187
Done.

32:42.488 --> 32:44.722
Speak fluent French.

32:47.459 --> 32:49.227
Can you look at me for a sec?

32:50.496 --> 32:51.696
You wanna hear my list?

32:51.698 --> 32:52.665
No.

32:53.566 --> 32:56.201
Painting class with Bob Ross.

32:57.904 --> 33:00.638
He's dead.

33:00.640 --> 33:02.809
Yeah, never mind. Uh...

33:03.876 --> 33:05.410
Sex in the Vatican.

33:05.978 --> 33:08.881
I'd rather help you
meet Bob Ross.

33:10.683 --> 33:11.684
I don't know.

33:13.452 --> 33:15.287
I'd like to travel the world.

33:16.055 --> 33:17.822
Actually get to see some of it

33:17.824 --> 33:20.960
and not the inside
of these hospitals.

33:28.034 --> 33:29.334
Thank you.

33:30.737 --> 33:31.771
For what?

33:33.338 --> 33:34.974
For saying something real.

33:39.612 --> 33:40.980
Was it the Vatican thing?

33:42.414 --> 33:43.616
Can you hurry up?

34:02.467 --> 34:04.001
<i>Okay. I just thought
you might want to know</i>

34:04.003 --> 34:05.536
<i>how this feels. You ready?</i>

34:05.538 --> 34:06.839
<i>And I brought a jumping buddy.</i>

34:07.472 --> 34:09.474
<i>Don't worry.
I'll hold him tight.</i>

34:10.076 --> 34:12.109
<i>All right, Abby,
ready to jump out of a plane?</i>

34:12.110 --> 34:13.376
<i>Ready!</i>

34:13.378 --> 34:15.047
<i>Happy Birthday, Stella.</i>

34:29.762 --> 34:31.731
<i>I love you, Stella.
I'll see you soon.</i>

34:32.632 --> 34:33.800
I love you, too.

34:45.610 --> 34:47.511
I like seeing you like this.

34:47.513 --> 34:48.813
Like what?

34:48.815 --> 34:50.447
Hopeful.

34:52.717 --> 34:53.753
All right.

34:55.755 --> 34:57.089
Hey, Julie.

35:00.660 --> 35:02.495
What if this doesn't work?

35:03.930 --> 35:05.565
What if it does?

35:45.705 --> 35:47.137
Ha-ha!

35:53.779 --> 35:55.348
<i>Why cartoons?</i>

35:55.848 --> 35:57.683
<i>They're subversive.</i>

35:58.551 --> 36:01.785
<i>They can be light and funny
but pack a powerful punch.</i>

36:01.787 --> 36:03.554
<i>I think a well-drawn cartoon</i>

36:03.556 --> 36:05.189
<i>can say a lot more
than words ever could.</i>

36:05.191 --> 36:06.557
Yeah?

36:06.559 --> 36:08.861
<i>What does this say exactly?</i>

36:09.528 --> 36:12.698
A lot more than words
ever could.

36:13.099 --> 36:14.967
<i>I think it's actually
pretty good.</i>

36:15.167 --> 36:17.103
<i>I think that's really good.
Behind you.</i>

36:17.570 --> 36:18.738
<i>What is that?</i>

36:19.238 --> 36:21.471
<i>Oh, those are lungs.
That's brilliant.</i>

36:21.473 --> 36:22.673
<i>Did you do that?</i>

36:22.675 --> 36:25.609
Uh, no, my older sister, Abby.

36:25.611 --> 36:26.679
<i>Wow. She's really good.</i>

36:27.780 --> 36:29.181
I'd love to see more of
her stuff. Do you have any?

36:31.050 --> 36:35.152
<i>We don't have to, uh,
share our stories, okay?</i>

36:35.154 --> 36:37.590
<i>We can just do
our treatments together.</i>

36:44.630 --> 36:48.098
<i>Hey, guys!
I have to get a nasal poly...</i>

36:48.100 --> 36:49.166
Polypectomy.

36:49.168 --> 36:51.702
We're removing polyps
from your nasal passages.

36:51.704 --> 36:53.070
And Stella's nervous.

36:53.072 --> 36:54.972
But I'm gonna be there
to sing her to sleep.

36:54.974 --> 36:56.874
Just like always.

36:56.876 --> 36:59.610
<i>♪ I love you
A bushel and a peck ♪</i>

36:59.612 --> 37:00.678
<i>♪ A bushel and a peck ♪</i>

37:00.680 --> 37:01.712
Don't sing
the whole thing yet.

37:01.714 --> 37:02.780
<i>♪ And a hug around the neck ♪</i>

37:02.782 --> 37:04.148
You're gonna jinx it.

37:04.150 --> 37:05.249
<i>♪ And a barrel and a heap ♪</i>

37:05.251 --> 37:06.684
You're gonna jinx it.

37:06.686 --> 37:09.853
<i>♪ And I'm talkin' in my sleep
About you ♪</i>

37:09.855 --> 37:11.090
But seriously.

37:11.590 --> 37:13.057
I'm gonna be there
when you go to sleep

37:13.059 --> 37:14.894
and I'm gonna be right here
when you wake up.

37:16.862 --> 37:17.964
Okay?

37:19.065 --> 37:20.066
Okay.

37:21.534 --> 37:22.702
I love you.

37:23.035 --> 37:24.503
I love you, too.

37:24.737 --> 37:26.303
<i>My sister, Abby,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

37:26.305 --> 37:28.572
<i>She's single, by the way.</i>

37:28.574 --> 37:29.942
<i>Her digits are...</i>

37:30.743 --> 37:31.976
That was last year.

37:31.978 --> 37:34.146
Abby's not in any of
the videos after that.

37:34.647 --> 37:36.080
I found Abby's Instagram.

37:36.082 --> 37:38.015
I mean, it's mostly art,

37:38.017 --> 37:40.617
her and Stella,
but you're right.

37:40.619 --> 37:42.488
I mean,
she hasn't posted in a year.

37:54.867 --> 37:57.201
Barb didn't see you come in,
did she?

37:57.203 --> 37:58.537
No.

38:10.683 --> 38:12.151
Abby's dead, isn't she?

38:16.155 --> 38:18.090
You're as delicate
as a jackhammer.

38:18.724 --> 38:22.028
We don't have time for
delicacy, Stella. We're dying.

38:22.828 --> 38:26.132
Can you stop reminding me
that I'm dying?

38:26.699 --> 38:28.966
I get it. I get that.

38:28.968 --> 38:30.868
Okay? I just can't.

38:30.870 --> 38:32.903
I have been dying
my whole life.

38:32.905 --> 38:35.906
Every birthday, we celebrated
it like it was my last one.

38:35.908 --> 38:37.608
I know. Me, too.

38:37.610 --> 38:40.646
Because then, yeah,
as you pointed out, Abby died.

38:42.782 --> 38:44.381
And then
my parents' marriage died.

38:44.383 --> 38:46.884
And it was supposed to be me.

38:46.886 --> 38:48.685
Everyone was ready for that.

38:48.687 --> 38:50.120
Everyone was prepared
for that.

38:50.122 --> 38:51.924
I just, I can't die.

38:53.959 --> 38:56.295
I just... My parents...
I can't.

38:57.229 --> 38:59.598
Is this why you're so obsessed
with your regimen?

39:01.033 --> 39:03.667
You're not afraid of dying.
You have survivor's guilt.

39:03.669 --> 39:04.601
Will?

39:04.603 --> 39:06.270
You're a sick girl
with survivor's guilt.

39:06.272 --> 39:08.305
This is out of your control.

39:08.307 --> 39:10.707
I just don't have
any other choice, okay?

39:10.709 --> 39:11.942
You do. But that's what
I'm trying to tell you.

39:11.944 --> 39:13.913
I don't!
Will, I don't.

39:15.147 --> 39:16.947
Okay, Stella.
Hey, I'm sorry.

39:16.949 --> 39:18.115
We're supposed
to be meditating.

39:18.117 --> 39:19.718
Stella, come on!

39:21.720 --> 39:23.353
<i>You knew
he had boundary issues.</i>

39:23.355 --> 39:26.056
For what it's worth, I don't
think he meant to hurt you.

39:26.058 --> 39:27.658
Yeah,
but it's still annoying.

39:27.660 --> 39:29.326
Like, he said
"Abby" and "dead"

39:29.328 --> 39:31.597
in the same sentence
like it was no big deal.

39:37.770 --> 39:39.105
I should've been there.

39:39.839 --> 39:42.808
I should've been there.

39:43.876 --> 39:45.010
Stella, look at me.

39:45.911 --> 39:47.179
You can't know.

39:47.713 --> 39:49.215
You just can't.

39:52.718 --> 39:54.820
Oh, this disease is a prison.

39:55.154 --> 39:57.323
I wanna hug you.

39:58.324 --> 40:01.160
Just pretend
that I'm doing it right now.

40:03.429 --> 40:04.730
I love you.

40:06.065 --> 40:07.333
I love you, too.

40:09.835 --> 40:11.268
You wanna get ice cream?

40:11.270 --> 40:13.172
Yes.

40:34.494 --> 40:37.997
If the infection
gets into the bloodstream...

40:41.100 --> 40:42.101
Hey.

40:44.103 --> 40:45.836
It's gonna be okay.

40:45.838 --> 40:47.838
You don't know that.

40:47.840 --> 40:50.709
You're right. I don't.
It's risky.

40:51.043 --> 40:53.179
But sepsis is
the bigger monster.

40:55.381 --> 40:56.682
Hey.

40:57.950 --> 41:00.117
You're a fighter,
Stella Grant.

41:00.119 --> 41:01.420
You always have been.

41:05.191 --> 41:06.458
So...

41:07.760 --> 41:08.761
Yeah?

41:09.128 --> 41:10.429
Yeah.

41:11.764 --> 41:13.132
Tomorrow morning, then.

41:15.134 --> 41:16.936
I'll let your parents know.

42:09.888 --> 42:10.990
Hey.

42:12.492 --> 42:13.792
You're here.

42:14.494 --> 42:15.526
I'm here.

42:15.528 --> 42:18.097
I got your cartoon.
You're forgiven. Back up.

42:21.467 --> 42:23.367
You missed our treatment.
What's going on?

42:23.369 --> 42:25.404
Infected G-tube.

42:26.038 --> 42:27.971
Dr. Hamid's worried
about sepsis,

42:27.973 --> 42:29.842
so she's replacing it
in the morning.

42:30.309 --> 42:31.908
I'm going under general.

42:31.910 --> 42:33.076
Shit.

42:33.078 --> 42:34.547
Are your lungs up for that?

42:36.181 --> 42:39.985
Do your nebulizer at 8:00,
and your AffloVest, okay?

43:46.553 --> 43:48.287
What are you doing here?

43:49.154 --> 43:51.088
I thought this was
the bathroom, honestly.

43:52.291 --> 43:54.494
It's your first surgery
without Abby.

43:55.628 --> 43:57.029
How do you know that?

43:57.229 --> 43:59.098
I've seen all your movies.

44:00.132 --> 44:01.634
Some might say

44:02.167 --> 44:03.634
I'm your biggest fan.

44:03.636 --> 44:06.840
So, I really hope
that I don't mess this up.

44:10.710 --> 44:14.378

Our grandma
used to sing that to us.

44:31.096 --> 44:34.030
I had to Google it.
It's really old.

44:34.032 --> 44:35.098
I know.

44:35.100 --> 44:36.433
What the heck's

44:36.435 --> 44:38.268
a barrel and a heap?

44:48.046 --> 44:49.616
You're gonna be okay.

44:50.315 --> 44:51.551
Promise?

44:58.758 --> 45:00.192
Hey.

45:00.760 --> 45:03.028
You ready to get this show
on the road?

45:03.663 --> 45:04.930
Yeah.

45:16.609 --> 45:18.509
Oh, hell, no!

45:18.511 --> 45:19.712
Will!

45:24.116 --> 45:25.685
She was scared.

45:26.084 --> 45:27.585
I just wanted to do
something nice.

45:32.492 --> 45:34.326
Come on!

45:35.060 --> 45:37.327
She's in more danger
under the anesthesia

45:37.329 --> 45:39.131
than she is with me.

45:42.735 --> 45:44.303
Trevor Von.

45:45.370 --> 45:48.338
That's who you remind me of.

45:48.340 --> 45:50.808
Trevor Von and Amy Presley.

45:50.810 --> 45:52.677
Oh, they were...

45:52.679 --> 45:55.080
They were in love.

45:55.815 --> 45:58.816
And I let them break the rules
so they could be happy.

45:58.818 --> 46:00.452
And let me guess,

46:01.453 --> 46:02.587
they died?

46:02.589 --> 46:04.757
Yes, Will, they did.

46:06.659 --> 46:08.327
On my watch.

46:11.396 --> 46:14.501
And I'd be damned
if I let that happen again.

46:37.256 --> 46:38.791
It's gonna be okay.

46:57.276 --> 46:58.743
You know what to do.

46:58.745 --> 47:00.212
Mmm-hmm.

47:01.848 --> 47:05.215
Ten, nine...

47:05.217 --> 47:06.418
...eight,

47:07.219 --> 47:08.555
seven...

47:10.557 --> 47:12.090
Shh...

48:05.377 --> 48:07.780
Oh...

48:41.279 --> 48:43.650
<i>Hi, it's me.</i>

48:44.349 --> 48:48.755
Call me
'cause I miss you, okay?

48:49.321 --> 48:51.856
But don't call me, 'cause
I just got out of surgery

48:51.858 --> 48:53.526
and I'm really tired.

48:53.726 --> 48:56.459
But call me though
when you get this,

48:56.461 --> 48:59.431
because you're cute

48:59.666 --> 49:02.502
<i>and I wanna see you</i>

49:03.402 --> 49:06.238
<i>and your fluffy little hair</i>

49:06.906 --> 49:10.608
and your little skinny legs.

49:10.610 --> 49:11.744
Okay?

49:12.578 --> 49:13.811
<i>Don't call me, though,</i>

49:13.813 --> 49:16.847
<i>because if I hear
your sexy voice,</i>

49:16.849 --> 49:19.284
<i>I won't be able
to sleep, so...</i>

49:20.720 --> 49:23.455
<i>Call me when you get this,
okay?</i>

49:24.524 --> 49:25.725
<i>Bye.</i>

50:41.567 --> 50:43.268
Will's not coming.

50:45.104 --> 50:46.404
Will?

50:47.940 --> 50:50.442
I'm not leaving
until you open the door.

50:54.046 --> 50:55.347
I can't.

50:58.450 --> 51:01.085
Just, please open the door
and we can talk about this.

51:01.087 --> 51:02.953
Okay? I don't care
what Barb said.

51:02.955 --> 51:05.057
Just open the door!

51:07.093 --> 51:08.526
I can't.

51:08.528 --> 51:09.829
Will, come on.

51:23.876 --> 51:25.377
Go away, Stella.

51:29.982 --> 51:31.816
Maybe it's better this way.

51:31.818 --> 51:34.051
No, I can figure this out.

51:34.053 --> 51:35.719
I need to figure this out.

51:35.721 --> 51:37.355
We're not normal kids.

51:38.591 --> 51:40.591
We don't get to take chances
like this.

51:40.593 --> 51:42.860
Oh, come on. You're not gonna
give me that, too?

51:42.862 --> 51:44.362
Admit what's going on here.

51:44.864 --> 51:46.999
Will's a risk-taker,
just like Abby.

51:48.634 --> 51:50.536
What's that supposed to mean?

51:51.971 --> 51:54.974
You think that I'm the one
that's afraid to take risks?

51:55.575 --> 51:56.974
What about you and your life

51:56.976 --> 51:58.843
and your relationships?

51:58.845 --> 52:01.411
You and Tim, you and Rick,
you and Michael.

52:01.413 --> 52:03.013
Don't go there.

52:03.015 --> 52:05.082
They knew you were sick
and they loved you.

52:05.084 --> 52:07.450
You were the one who ran.
Every time, you ran.

52:07.452 --> 52:08.451
You don't know
what you're talking about.

52:08.453 --> 52:10.955
You ruined every chance
you've ever had at love,

52:10.957 --> 52:12.992
so just keep your advice
to yourself.

53:37.009 --> 53:38.010
Bitch.

53:38.644 --> 53:39.779
Asshole.

53:41.747 --> 53:43.416
You know, you're right.

53:44.250 --> 53:45.651
I am afraid.

53:46.585 --> 53:49.019
You know what someone gets
for loving me?

53:49.021 --> 53:51.221
They get to pay
for all my care.

53:51.223 --> 53:53.059
And then
they get to watch me die.

53:54.794 --> 53:58.262
Deductibles, meds,
hospital stays, surgeries.

53:58.264 --> 54:01.598
When I turn 18,
there's no more full coverage.

54:01.600 --> 54:03.100
Who should I put that on?

54:03.102 --> 54:05.470
Michael or my family?

54:05.972 --> 54:07.873
It's my sickness,
it's my problem.

54:10.242 --> 54:11.942
Maybe we can get Will
to marry you.

54:11.944 --> 54:13.045
He's loaded.

54:14.580 --> 54:16.649
He's not picky.
He likes you.

54:21.887 --> 54:23.189
I am sorry

54:24.724 --> 54:26.125
about you and Will.

54:40.940 --> 54:42.241
Stella?

54:44.610 --> 54:45.711
What?

54:47.980 --> 54:49.181
Stella?

55:20.880 --> 55:21.845
<i>Hello.</i>

55:21.847 --> 55:24.348
<i>There is something
a little bit different</i>

55:24.350 --> 55:26.552
<i>I want to talk about today.</i>

55:26.886 --> 55:29.088
Burkholderia cepacia.

55:29.755 --> 55:32.322
<i>The risks, the restrictions</i>

55:32.324 --> 55:35.025
<i>and the rules of engagement.</i>

55:35.027 --> 55:39.296
B. cepacia
is a hardy bacteria.

55:39.298 --> 55:42.166
Okay? It is so adaptive

55:42.168 --> 55:45.271
that it literally feeds
on penicillin.

55:45.704 --> 55:49.339
So, our first line
of defense is

55:49.341 --> 55:53.811
Cal Stat, a hospital-grade
hand sterilizer.

55:53.813 --> 55:56.849
<i>Apply liberally and often.</i>

55:57.049 --> 56:01.418
Next is
good old-fashioned latex!

56:01.420 --> 56:04.054
<i>Tried-and-true.</i>

56:04.056 --> 56:07.660
<i>Used for protection
in all types of activities.</i>

56:08.427 --> 56:13.330
<i>B. cepacia thrives best
in saliva or phlegm.</i>

56:13.332 --> 56:16.233
<i>Fun fact,
a cough can travel six feet,</i>

56:16.235 --> 56:19.436
<i>a sneeze can travel
up to 200 miles per hour.</i>

56:19.438 --> 56:24.910
But the "no saliva" thing
also means no kissing.

56:25.277 --> 56:26.645
Ever.

56:27.046 --> 56:30.347
<i>So, our best defense
is distance.</i>

56:30.349 --> 56:33.285
<i>Six feet at all times.</i>

56:34.019 --> 56:35.986
<i>Ta-da!</i>

56:35.988 --> 56:37.287
<i>Here's a pool cue.</i>

56:37.289 --> 56:40.059
<i>It measures
approximately five feet.</i>

56:41.393 --> 56:43.427
<i>Five feet.</i>

56:43.429 --> 56:46.866
I've given a lot of thought
to foot number six.

56:47.266 --> 56:49.802
And you know what?
It made me mad.

56:50.402 --> 56:54.673
<i>When you have cystic fibrosis,
so much is taken from you.</i>

56:55.141 --> 56:56.974
<i>You live
every day of your life</i>

56:56.976 --> 56:59.443
<i>according to treatments,
and pills, and schedules.</i>

56:59.445 --> 57:01.778
<i>Most of us
can't have children.</i>

57:01.780 --> 57:03.347
<i>A lot of us
don't even live long enough</i>

57:03.349 --> 57:04.948
<i>to try to have children.</i>

57:04.950 --> 57:08.486
<i>Shit, it's complicated
to try to explain,</i>

57:08.488 --> 57:12.358
<i>but it's even hard
to fall in love.</i>

57:13.893 --> 57:17.828
<i>So, after all that
CF has stolen from me,</i>

57:17.830 --> 57:19.229
<i>from us,</i>

57:19.231 --> 57:22.668
<i>I don't mind stealing
a little something back.</i>

57:23.135 --> 57:24.370
One foot.

57:25.505 --> 57:27.771
One fucking foot

57:27.773 --> 57:29.306
of space, of distance,

57:29.308 --> 57:31.041
of length, or whatever
you wanna call it.

57:31.043 --> 57:33.445
I don't mind
stealing that back.

57:34.079 --> 57:35.814
Because CF...

57:37.983 --> 57:40.186
you're not the thief anymore.

57:40.487 --> 57:42.319
I'm the thief now.

57:55.267 --> 57:56.869
Five feet apart.

57:57.236 --> 57:58.304
Deal?

58:01.508 --> 58:03.075
Are you in?

58:13.919 --> 58:15.287
I'm so in.

58:20.527 --> 58:23.762
Atrium. 9:00.

58:34.139 --> 58:36.340
Why didn't I pack
anything nice?

58:36.342 --> 58:39.479
Oh, 'cause you always pack
for a hot hospital romance.

59:08.608 --> 59:10.409
Is this see-through?

59:11.143 --> 59:13.178
Don't even think about it, ho.

59:45.911 --> 59:46.945
Hi.

59:48.113 --> 59:49.148
Hi.

01:00:13.038 --> 01:00:14.907
<i>He cut and ran
when I was born.</i>

01:00:15.207 --> 01:00:17.876
I guess having a sick kid
wasn't part of his plan.

01:00:18.277 --> 01:00:19.845
What about your mom?

01:00:20.079 --> 01:00:23.013
She's beautiful and driven
and smart.

01:00:23.015 --> 01:00:26.985
She's just focused on me
and me alone.

01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:30.120
So, starting tomorrow,
when I'm 18,

01:00:30.122 --> 01:00:32.523
I will be making the decisions
for myself.

01:00:32.525 --> 01:00:34.159
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:36.496
Tomorrow's your birthday?

01:00:37.930 --> 01:00:39.196
You could have told me that.

01:00:39.198 --> 01:00:41.033
I don't have
a present for you.

01:00:42.635 --> 01:00:45.638
How about you just promise to
stick around for the next one?

01:00:49.007 --> 01:00:50.510
Come on.

01:00:51.544 --> 01:00:53.480
I'm getting out of here.

01:00:56.148 --> 01:00:58.350
There is this one theory
I like

01:00:58.618 --> 01:01:01.987
that says, "To understand death,
you have to look at birth."

01:01:03.155 --> 01:01:04.591
So, like,

01:01:05.157 --> 01:01:09.061
while we're in the womb,
we're living that existence

01:01:09.428 --> 01:01:12.362
not knowing
that our next existence

01:01:12.364 --> 01:01:14.297
is just an inch away.

01:01:14.299 --> 01:01:17.568
So, maybe it's the same
with death.

01:01:17.570 --> 01:01:21.572
Maybe death is just
the next life,

01:01:21.574 --> 01:01:23.075
but an inch away.

01:01:24.076 --> 01:01:27.946
Or maybe it's just
a big sleep, baby.

01:01:29.181 --> 01:01:30.315
Lights out.

01:01:31.150 --> 01:01:32.317
Done and done.

01:01:32.985 --> 01:01:34.119
No.

01:01:37.089 --> 01:01:38.155
There's no way

01:01:38.157 --> 01:01:43.427
that Abby just blinked out.

01:01:43.429 --> 01:01:45.197
I refuse to believe it.

01:01:46.666 --> 01:01:49.468
What happened with Abby?

01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:57.075
She was cliff diving
in California.

01:01:58.010 --> 01:02:01.113
She landed wrong,
broke her neck and drowned.

01:02:04.450 --> 01:02:06.283
They said
she didn't feel any pain,

01:02:06.285 --> 01:02:10.255
but how would they know
if she felt pain?

01:02:11.558 --> 01:02:15.160
I was supposed to be there
with her, but I got sick.

01:02:15.461 --> 01:02:17.162
Like I always do.

01:02:19.532 --> 01:02:23.035
I just keep imagining it
over and over again.

01:02:23.703 --> 01:02:25.237
What she was feeling.

01:02:30.810 --> 01:02:34.044
Without knowing that,
she just never stops dying.

01:02:34.046 --> 01:02:35.047
Stella.

01:02:36.048 --> 01:02:38.549
Even if you were there,
you still wouldn't know.

01:02:38.551 --> 01:02:40.185
But I wasn't there.

01:02:43.523 --> 01:02:45.257
She died alone.

01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:49.762
Isn't that how
we're gonna die?

01:02:51.430 --> 01:02:54.433
Drowning.
Just without the water.

01:02:55.133 --> 01:02:57.504
Our own fluids
doing the dirty work.

01:03:01.574 --> 01:03:03.510
I think about
that last breath a lot.

01:03:04.777 --> 01:03:06.613
Gasping for air,

01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:09.482
not getting any.

01:03:10.750 --> 01:03:11.816
No air,

01:03:11.818 --> 01:03:15.387
just black.

01:03:17.790 --> 01:03:19.524
But that's only on Mondays.

01:03:19.526 --> 01:03:21.628
Otherwise,
I don't dwell on it.

01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:28.400
There's that smile.

01:03:33.338 --> 01:03:35.307
God, you're beautiful.

01:03:36.843 --> 01:03:38.310
And brave.

01:03:43.315 --> 01:03:45.217
I wish I could touch you.

01:04:33.666 --> 01:04:34.834
I lied

01:04:35.802 --> 01:04:37.302
when we met.

01:04:40.405 --> 01:04:43.108
I've never had sex.

01:04:46.278 --> 01:04:48.512
I've never wanted anyone
to see me.

01:04:48.514 --> 01:04:50.115
The scars, uh,

01:04:53.753 --> 01:04:55.888
the tube,
nothing about it's sexy.

01:04:57.322 --> 01:04:59.424
Everything about you is sexy.

01:05:01.861 --> 01:05:03.496
I think you're perfect.

01:07:10.556 --> 01:07:12.390
Good morning.

01:07:19.065 --> 01:07:21.266
<i>See those lights out there?</i>

01:07:21.534 --> 01:07:23.601
Abby and I would
call them stars

01:07:23.603 --> 01:07:25.972
and we would make wishes.

01:07:27.807 --> 01:07:29.640
She'd never tell me
what her wish was,

01:07:29.642 --> 01:07:34.446
but I knew she wished
for new lungs for me.

01:07:35.715 --> 01:07:37.550
I hope she gets her wish.

01:07:38.416 --> 01:07:39.986
Yeah, me too.

01:07:42.855 --> 01:07:45.057
Mornin', Barb.

01:08:11.050 --> 01:08:13.052
Where are they?

01:08:14.554 --> 01:08:15.555
Who?

01:08:16.589 --> 01:08:18.423
What are you talking about?

01:08:30.903 --> 01:08:33.438
Oh, shit.
Barb knows we're gone.

01:08:33.706 --> 01:08:34.738
Okay.

01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:37.710
Uh, she'll look for me first
in the NICU, so...

01:08:38.176 --> 01:08:40.479
Bye! Okay.

01:10:15.741 --> 01:10:17.576
I'm free!

01:10:18.277 --> 01:10:19.512
Oh...

01:10:20.012 --> 01:10:21.712
Oh, my gosh!

01:10:21.714 --> 01:10:23.080
Happy Birthday!

01:10:23.082 --> 01:10:24.982
I'm so sorry.
I forgot.

01:10:24.984 --> 01:10:26.116
No, it's fine.

01:10:26.118 --> 01:10:28.118
What are you doing? Are you
busy? Let's take a walk.

01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:30.020
<i>I can't right now.</i>

01:10:30.022 --> 01:10:31.157
I'm sorry.

01:10:31.958 --> 01:10:33.223
Studying.

01:10:33.225 --> 01:10:34.593
<i>Maybe later?</i>

01:10:35.061 --> 01:10:36.860
My friends
are actually coming later.

01:10:36.862 --> 01:10:38.128
That's all right.

01:10:38.130 --> 01:10:39.732
We'll figure something out.

01:10:40.866 --> 01:10:42.601
I was just, uh,

01:10:43.169 --> 01:10:44.503
missing you.

01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:49.108
Talk to you later.

01:10:49.308 --> 01:10:51.241
<i>All right. Bye.</i>

01:10:57.149 --> 01:10:58.484
Jason.

01:11:00.019 --> 01:11:01.318
Yeah, no. Don't...

01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:03.255
No. Don't worry about it.
It's fine.

01:11:03.923 --> 01:11:05.958
<i>No, seriously, I'm not mad.</i>

01:11:07.259 --> 01:11:09.862
It's fine.
Just do your thing.

01:11:10.296 --> 01:11:11.931
<i>I'll talk to you tomorrow.</i>

01:13:50.723 --> 01:13:52.191
Thought you'd never find me.

01:13:55.060 --> 01:13:56.760
I know it's late,

01:13:56.762 --> 01:13:59.798
but we had to wait
till the cafeteria closed.

01:14:00.099 --> 01:14:01.231
"We"?

01:14:01.233 --> 01:14:02.234
Mmm-hmm.

01:14:06.972 --> 01:14:08.906
Surprise!

01:14:12.011 --> 01:14:14.211
We felt so bad
for ditching you, dude.

01:14:14.213 --> 01:14:16.346
But your girlfriend DM'd us

01:14:16.348 --> 01:14:17.915
and convinced us
to surprise you, man.

01:14:17.917 --> 01:14:19.517
"Girlfriend"?

01:14:19.519 --> 01:14:20.886
You're so good.

01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:22.487
Yeah, I'm good.

01:14:22.489 --> 01:14:24.087
I can't believe
he's real.

01:14:24.089 --> 01:14:25.222
I know!

01:14:25.224 --> 01:14:27.758
And he's even hotter
in person.

01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:28.825
Seriously.

01:14:28.827 --> 01:14:30.827
Hey,
the food's almost ready!

01:14:30.829 --> 01:14:32.231
And Happy Birthday!

01:14:40.206 --> 01:14:43.075
Just wanted to observe
the master at work.

01:14:43.375 --> 01:14:46.245
Are those roses?

01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:49.179
They're so beautiful.

01:14:49.181 --> 01:14:50.249
How do you do that?

01:14:50.449 --> 01:14:52.318
I've been practicing.

01:14:55.921 --> 01:14:57.387
'Cause next month,
Michael and I

01:14:57.389 --> 01:14:58.991
are gonna go see my mom.

01:14:59.425 --> 01:15:00.793
Really?

01:15:02.161 --> 01:15:04.463
He's coming to lunch tomorrow
and I'm gonna go for it.

01:15:05.464 --> 01:15:07.166
Oh, my God!

01:15:09.268 --> 01:15:10.402
He loves me.

01:15:11.403 --> 01:15:13.072
And I love him, too.

01:15:13.906 --> 01:15:17.241
Aw, Poe, I'm so happy!

01:15:17.243 --> 01:15:18.408
Don't go all soppy on me.

01:15:18.410 --> 01:15:20.377
You know
I can't let a girl cry alone.

01:15:22.348 --> 01:15:24.214
They're happy tears.

01:15:24.216 --> 01:15:27.317
I'm happy for you, Poe.

01:15:31.991 --> 01:15:33.192
Let's eat!

01:15:48.541 --> 01:15:51.041
Poe, where did you get
all of this?

01:15:51.043 --> 01:15:52.976
Hospitals have VIP kitchens

01:15:52.978 --> 01:15:54.378
where they keep
all the good stuff.

01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:56.882
You know,
for celebrities, politicians.

01:15:57.149 --> 01:15:59.818
But tonight, Birthday Boy,
it's for you.

01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:02.421
<i>Salud!</i>

01:16:02.988 --> 01:16:04.491
<i>Salud!</i>

01:16:18.070 --> 01:16:19.604
We were, like, ten!

01:16:19.606 --> 01:16:22.573
Yes. And we literally
put sheets over our head

01:16:22.575 --> 01:16:24.341
and ran
into the dementia ward!

01:16:28.047 --> 01:16:30.113
It was just like that!

01:16:30.115 --> 01:16:32.082
Woo!

01:16:32.084 --> 01:16:33.283
It was crazy.

01:16:33.285 --> 01:16:35.821
It was
the best Halloween ever!

01:16:36.489 --> 01:16:38.155
We got in so much trouble.

01:16:38.157 --> 01:16:39.590
And it wasn't even our idea.

01:16:39.592 --> 01:16:42.259
Remember? Abby...
Abby came up with that.

01:16:52.004 --> 01:16:53.506
Abby was wild.

01:16:54.306 --> 01:16:56.507
She was free.

01:16:56.509 --> 01:16:58.375
She always said
she was gonna live big

01:16:58.377 --> 01:17:00.145
because Stella couldn't.

01:17:01.113 --> 01:17:02.179
She did.

01:17:02.181 --> 01:17:03.614
She lived big.

01:17:03.616 --> 01:17:05.918
Bigger than any of us.

01:17:06.452 --> 01:17:07.685
She would've loved
a clandestine party

01:17:07.687 --> 01:17:08.887
like this one!

01:17:09.188 --> 01:17:10.289
She would've.

01:17:13.092 --> 01:17:15.060
To Abby.

01:17:16.295 --> 01:17:17.497
To Abby.

01:17:22.301 --> 01:17:27.137
<i>♪ Happy Birthday to you! ♪</i>

01:17:27.139 --> 01:17:28.407
Whoo!

01:17:30.109 --> 01:17:31.343
Make a wish!

01:17:36.583 --> 01:17:39.385
I can't blow the candles out
or else you guys can't eat it.

01:17:45.224 --> 01:17:46.957
I made a wish for you.

01:17:46.959 --> 01:17:48.358
Thank you.

01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:50.093
One. Two.

01:17:50.095 --> 01:17:51.395
All right.

01:17:52.965 --> 01:17:54.131
Yay!

01:17:54.133 --> 01:17:56.368
Happy Birthday, Will!

01:17:58.505 --> 01:17:59.506
Barb?

01:17:59.706 --> 01:18:01.004
Hey!

01:18:02.509 --> 01:18:04.307
We thought
you were off tonight.

01:18:04.309 --> 01:18:06.613
You want us
to fix you a plate?

01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:08.746
That's it. That's it.

01:18:08.748 --> 01:18:10.347
You're all confined
to your rooms

01:18:10.349 --> 01:18:11.649
while we get
respiratory cultures.

01:18:11.651 --> 01:18:13.183
And you.

01:18:13.185 --> 01:18:14.719
You'll be transferred
in the morning.

01:18:14.721 --> 01:18:16.721
Barb!
Barb, it wasn't his fault.

01:18:16.723 --> 01:18:18.689
Well, you might be willing
to gamble with your lives,

01:18:18.691 --> 01:18:19.757
but I'm not!

01:18:19.759 --> 01:18:21.391
Just like when
we were kids.

01:18:21.393 --> 01:18:23.528
But you're not kids
anymore, Poe.

01:18:23.530 --> 01:18:25.462
But we were safe
like you taught us to be.

01:18:25.464 --> 01:18:26.764
Oh.

01:18:26.766 --> 01:18:29.067
I'm sorry, but it was fun!

01:18:44.383 --> 01:18:46.651
<i>All right, I'm gonna
let you go to sleep, okay?</i>

01:18:46.653 --> 01:18:48.185
Good night.

01:18:48.187 --> 01:18:49.522
<i>Good night.</i>

01:18:59.799 --> 01:19:01.264
A little pick-me-up?

01:19:01.266 --> 01:19:02.267
Thank you.

01:19:03.235 --> 01:19:05.538
It's just safer if he goes.

01:19:06.305 --> 01:19:07.605
You're probably right.

01:19:07.607 --> 01:19:09.540
She's gonna hate me.

01:19:09.542 --> 01:19:11.343
Mmm-hmm.

01:19:14.079 --> 01:19:15.447
What's up, Poe?

01:19:17.282 --> 01:19:19.517
He probably sat
on the call button again.

01:19:19.519 --> 01:19:20.520
I got it.

01:19:24.056 --> 01:19:26.291
Knock, knock. Poe?

01:19:30.563 --> 01:19:32.532
Code Blue!

01:19:35.234 --> 01:19:36.801
<i>Attention,
all medical personnel.</i>

01:19:36.803 --> 01:19:38.703
<i>Poe! Poe!</i>

01:19:38.705 --> 01:19:40.072
Poe!

01:19:40.339 --> 01:19:41.438
No pulse.

01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:43.106
Oh, God! Okay.

01:19:43.108 --> 01:19:44.040
Stay with me, baby.

01:19:44.042 --> 01:19:45.510
He's not breathing.
He's not breathing.

01:19:45.512 --> 01:19:47.177
Come on, you can do it.
Come on.

01:19:47.179 --> 01:19:49.047
Bag him.
Start chest compressions!

01:19:50.182 --> 01:19:51.649
Come on!

01:19:51.651 --> 01:19:52.717
Give him an Epi!

01:19:52.719 --> 01:19:53.718
Come on, baby!

01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:55.520
It's a massive
tension pneumothorax.

01:19:55.522 --> 01:19:56.587
His lung is collapsing!

01:19:59.559 --> 01:20:01.091
Put the pads on him!
Put the pads on him!

01:20:01.093 --> 01:20:02.325
Come on, buddy.

01:20:02.327 --> 01:20:04.294
Come on, sweetie.
Come on, sweetie!

01:20:04.296 --> 01:20:05.462
Come on, buddy!

01:20:05.464 --> 01:20:06.531
Barb, what's happening?

01:20:06.533 --> 01:20:08.098
Somebody get her out of here!

01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:09.165
Close that door!

01:20:09.167 --> 01:20:10.637
Barb, what's happening?

01:20:17.844 --> 01:20:19.376
Dr. Hamid?

01:20:19.378 --> 01:20:20.645
Not now, Stella.

01:20:20.647 --> 01:20:22.347
Dr. Hamid?

01:20:25.818 --> 01:20:27.419
I'm sorry.

01:20:28.353 --> 01:20:29.556
I'm so sorry.

01:20:30.122 --> 01:20:31.123
No!

01:20:33.191 --> 01:20:34.393
No!

01:20:35.193 --> 01:20:37.597
I'm so sorry.

01:20:49.842 --> 01:20:50.908
No!

01:20:56.516 --> 01:20:57.784
Oh, my God!

01:21:00.252 --> 01:21:02.689
Oh, my God!
He's gone!

01:21:03.623 --> 01:21:05.489
Michael's never gonna
see him again.

01:21:05.491 --> 01:21:07.560
His parents are never gonna
see him again.

01:21:09.428 --> 01:21:11.731
I'm never gonna see him again.

01:21:16.803 --> 01:21:18.470
I never hugged him!

01:21:19.939 --> 01:21:21.038
I never hugged him!

01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:25.143
He's my best friend and
I never fucking hugged him!

01:21:27.580 --> 01:21:29.147
Oh, God!

01:21:32.384 --> 01:21:34.087
I'm losing everyone.

01:21:34.787 --> 01:21:36.321
You're not losing me.

01:21:37.289 --> 01:21:38.658
What are you doing?

01:21:39.892 --> 01:21:41.224
Get out!

01:21:41.226 --> 01:21:42.860
Get out!

01:21:42.862 --> 01:21:44.396
Just get out!

01:24:47.412 --> 01:24:49.015
I wanna go see the lights.

01:24:49.816 --> 01:24:52.718
It's gotta be, like,
two miles away.

01:24:53.853 --> 01:24:56.354
Hey, come on, let's go inside.

01:24:57.123 --> 01:24:58.591
Come with me.

01:24:59.492 --> 01:25:01.725
Stella, now's not the time
to be rebellious.

01:25:01.727 --> 01:25:03.060
Is this about Poe?

01:25:03.062 --> 01:25:04.396
It is about Poe.

01:25:04.630 --> 01:25:06.764
It's about Abby,
it's about you and me

01:25:06.766 --> 01:25:09.101
and all the things that we'll
never get to do together.

01:25:09.869 --> 01:25:13.403
This whole time, I've been
living for my treatments

01:25:13.405 --> 01:25:16.108
instead of doing my treatments
so that I can live.

01:25:17.844 --> 01:25:19.344
I wanna live.

01:25:23.549 --> 01:25:25.149
It's just life, Will.

01:25:25.151 --> 01:25:26.986
It'll be over
before we know it.

01:25:32.792 --> 01:25:33.860
All right.

01:25:36.062 --> 01:25:38.030
Can we catch a cab at least?

01:25:39.665 --> 01:25:41.901
I wanna walk
and enjoy the night.

01:25:45.538 --> 01:25:47.139
Glove.
We're good.

01:26:03.489 --> 01:26:05.589
How are you always
getting me to exercise?

01:26:21.941 --> 01:26:23.910
Sure looks better
from up here.

01:26:52.004 --> 01:26:53.105
What's that?

01:26:57.076 --> 01:26:59.178
Yeah, you're gonna have
to explain that one.

01:27:02.682 --> 01:27:03.881
Abby got it for me

01:27:03.883 --> 01:27:05.849
the first time I came
to the hospital.

01:27:05.851 --> 01:27:07.920
I've had it with me
every time since.

01:27:10.523 --> 01:27:11.889
That's a relief, honestly,

01:27:11.891 --> 01:27:12.823
'cause I didn't have
the heart to tell you

01:27:12.825 --> 01:27:15.194
that a third boob might be
a deal breaker.

01:27:46.625 --> 01:27:48.027
Hey, Stella.

01:27:49.295 --> 01:27:50.262
Hmm?

01:27:50.963 --> 01:27:53.099
It's cold.

01:28:02.742 --> 01:28:03.776
Come on.

01:28:04.210 --> 01:28:05.778
Let's go see your lights.

01:28:17.923 --> 01:28:19.558
Let's take a breather.

01:28:30.369 --> 01:28:32.770
Stella?
Hey, don't do that.

01:28:32.772 --> 01:28:33.937
Stella.

01:28:33.939 --> 01:28:35.274
It's frozen solid.

01:28:46.318 --> 01:28:47.384
Hey, ladies.

01:28:47.386 --> 01:28:49.820
I just got a call from
St. Luke's in Kansas City.

01:28:49.822 --> 01:28:50.888
Car accident with fatalities.

01:28:50.890 --> 01:28:54.324
One female, AB neg, 5'2",
thoracic cage size...

01:28:54.326 --> 01:28:55.659
Stella's getting lungs.

01:28:55.661 --> 01:28:57.696
ETA three hours.
Get her prepped.

01:29:02.168 --> 01:29:03.636
Oh, my God.

01:29:08.140 --> 01:29:10.174
No, no, no, no, no.

01:29:10.176 --> 01:29:12.810
No, no, no, no, no. No!

01:29:23.355 --> 01:29:24.356
Whew!

01:29:48.848 --> 01:29:49.849
Hey.

01:29:51.917 --> 01:29:53.219
Everything all right?

01:30:04.130 --> 01:30:05.164
Yeah.

01:30:09.335 --> 01:30:10.870
Yeah, I'm good.

01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:16.075
Oh!

01:30:22.848 --> 01:30:24.049
I love you, Stella.

01:30:46.772 --> 01:30:47.940
I love you, too.

01:31:23.375 --> 01:31:24.877
We can't.

01:31:30.249 --> 01:31:31.350
I know.

01:31:33.285 --> 01:31:34.320
Stella.

01:31:51.136 --> 01:31:52.402
Oh...

01:31:52.404 --> 01:31:53.538
Shit!

01:31:53.540 --> 01:31:54.907
Come on, come on!

01:31:55.140 --> 01:31:56.206
Come on.

01:31:57.409 --> 01:31:59.445
Come on.

01:31:59.945 --> 01:32:02.279
Barb. Barb? Barb.

01:32:02.281 --> 01:32:03.213
She's not answering,

01:32:03.215 --> 01:32:04.314
and now it's going
straight to voicemail.

01:32:04.316 --> 01:32:06.817
Stella would never run off.
She wouldn't do that.

01:32:06.819 --> 01:32:07.985
Have you been able
to reach him?

01:32:07.987 --> 01:32:09.920
No.

01:32:09.922 --> 01:32:12.055
How long have they been gone?

01:32:12.057 --> 01:32:13.591
If your son causes Stella
to lose these lungs...

01:32:13.593 --> 01:32:15.359
My son is just
as sick as your daughter is.

01:32:15.361 --> 01:32:16.893
Stella would never do
anything like this.

01:32:16.895 --> 01:32:17.961
She's never done anything.

01:32:17.963 --> 01:32:19.096
Stella did this, Erin.

01:32:19.098 --> 01:32:21.999
Not Will. He doesn't know
anything about the lungs.

01:32:22.001 --> 01:32:23.200
Lungs?

01:32:23.202 --> 01:32:25.035
Is there a transplant?

01:32:25.037 --> 01:32:27.039
Yeah, for Stella.
They're on the way.

01:32:27.373 --> 01:32:29.139
Well, tell me
at least you're a cat person.

01:32:29.141 --> 01:32:30.207
Do you like cats?

01:32:30.209 --> 01:32:31.542
I owned a ferret.

01:32:31.544 --> 01:32:33.443
I was a ferret kid.

01:32:33.445 --> 01:32:35.480
Oh, no.
You would be a ferret kid.

01:32:37.449 --> 01:32:39.349
Don't answer it.

01:32:39.351 --> 01:32:40.618
Really. What do they need
right now?

01:32:40.620 --> 01:32:42.052
It's my mom.

01:32:42.054 --> 01:32:44.123
Let me just tell her
that I'm okay.

01:32:48.595 --> 01:32:50.429
Stella, they have
new lungs for you.

01:32:52.231 --> 01:32:54.064
Hey, they have
new lungs for you.

01:32:54.066 --> 01:32:55.299
Let's go to the hospital.
Come on!

01:32:55.301 --> 01:32:57.069
I haven't seen the lights yet.

01:32:57.903 --> 01:32:58.904
The lights?

01:33:00.005 --> 01:33:01.972
Did you know about this?
What are we doing out here?

01:33:01.974 --> 01:33:03.040
Let's go to the hospital.

01:33:03.042 --> 01:33:04.207
Come on.

01:33:04.209 --> 01:33:05.175
Five years?

01:33:05.177 --> 01:33:06.443
Five years is a lifetime
for people like us.

01:33:06.445 --> 01:33:07.411
It's not!
Because what happens

01:33:07.413 --> 01:33:08.546
when they fail
and I'm back to square one?

01:33:08.548 --> 01:33:10.247
Let's not be stupid. Can we go
the hospital, please?

01:33:10.249 --> 01:33:11.381
Come on, let's go.

01:33:13.252 --> 01:33:14.386
Stella!

01:33:26.031 --> 01:33:27.230
Stella.

01:33:27.232 --> 01:33:28.400
Come on.

01:33:28.635 --> 01:33:30.770
Please? It's cold.

01:33:34.641 --> 01:33:35.841
Stella!

01:33:43.349 --> 01:33:44.484
Stella!

01:34:01.100 --> 01:34:02.101
Stella.

01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:41.641
Help!

01:34:54.186 --> 01:34:55.555
Come on, Stella.

01:35:14.473 --> 01:35:15.675
Come on!

01:35:16.208 --> 01:35:17.209
Come on!

01:35:22.181 --> 01:35:23.313
Come on, Stella.

01:36:55.642 --> 01:36:56.807
We have a 17-year-old...

01:36:56.809 --> 01:36:57.909
What have we got?

01:36:57.911 --> 01:37:00.811
A 17-year-old
female with cystic fibrosis.

01:37:00.813 --> 01:37:02.212
We already have lungs for her.

01:37:02.214 --> 01:37:03.346
Can someone get
the other mask off?

01:37:03.348 --> 01:37:04.882
Oh, my God. Honey.

01:37:04.884 --> 01:37:07.284
It's okay.

01:37:07.286 --> 01:37:09.654
My son.
My son was out there, too.

01:37:09.656 --> 01:37:10.855
I'm sorry.
Step back, please.

01:37:10.857 --> 01:37:12.322
You're okay.
You're okay.

01:37:12.324 --> 01:37:14.124
Where's Will?

01:37:14.126 --> 01:37:15.258
Where's Will?

01:37:15.260 --> 01:37:16.594
Honey.

01:37:16.596 --> 01:37:17.830
Coming through!

01:37:18.698 --> 01:37:20.598
Is he okay?

01:37:21.801 --> 01:37:24.134
Get a mask on her
as soon as possible, please.

01:37:24.136 --> 01:37:25.570
O2 is at 45.

01:37:25.572 --> 01:37:26.571
Possible hypothermia.

01:37:26.573 --> 01:37:28.405
We're gonna need
more blankets over here.

01:37:28.407 --> 01:37:30.442
Just breathe.
Stella?

01:37:30.677 --> 01:37:32.409
I've got you, honey.

01:37:32.411 --> 01:37:34.377
Stella?

01:37:34.379 --> 01:37:35.546
You need to calm down.

01:37:35.548 --> 01:37:36.881
We have your new lungs.

01:37:36.883 --> 01:37:38.348
Yes, Stella.

01:37:38.350 --> 01:37:39.850
I don't want them.

01:37:39.852 --> 01:37:41.786
Stella, we've been waiting
for these lungs for years.

01:37:41.788 --> 01:37:43.521
What are you talking about?

01:37:43.523 --> 01:37:45.422
If you don't use the lungs,
they're wasted, sweetie.

01:37:45.424 --> 01:37:46.591
I love him. The new lungs

01:37:46.593 --> 01:37:47.758
won't mean anything
without him.

01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:49.660
Lay down!

01:37:49.662 --> 01:37:51.396
Stop! Stop!

01:37:51.598 --> 01:37:53.600
Please! Stop.

01:37:53.900 --> 01:37:55.267
Will!

01:37:56.268 --> 01:37:57.469
Please.

01:37:59.539 --> 01:38:00.873
Take the lungs.

01:38:02.374 --> 01:38:03.576
For me.

01:38:06.378 --> 01:38:07.243
Okay.

01:38:07.245 --> 01:38:08.512
Come on, put the mask on.

01:38:08.514 --> 01:38:09.580
I'm ready.

01:38:09.582 --> 01:38:11.247
Okay, all right,
let's go, everyone.

01:38:11.249 --> 01:38:12.215
Okay, okay.

01:38:12.217 --> 01:38:13.017
Okay, here we go.
We're moving.

01:38:13.019 --> 01:38:14.485
I'll be right here,
honey.

01:38:14.487 --> 01:38:16.186
Let's go.

01:38:16.188 --> 01:38:17.824
Okay, I love you so much.

01:38:18.958 --> 01:38:20.390
I love you, Dad.

01:38:21.694 --> 01:38:23.128
Okay, here we go.

01:38:23.696 --> 01:38:25.197
Dr. Hamid.

01:38:25.598 --> 01:38:27.466
I gave her mouth-to-mouth.

01:38:28.968 --> 01:38:30.901
I'm sorry. I didn't have
any other choice.

01:38:30.903 --> 01:38:32.003
You saved her life, Will.

01:38:32.005 --> 01:38:34.874
<i>If she has B. cepacia,
we'll deal with it, okay?</i>

01:40:30.823 --> 01:40:32.759
Bacterial cultures came back.

01:40:33.893 --> 01:40:36.996
I don't know how,
but she's clean.

01:40:37.563 --> 01:40:38.965
She didn't get it.

01:40:42.568 --> 01:40:44.537
But that doesn't mean
she won't.

01:40:48.674 --> 01:40:50.275
What about Will?

01:40:51.677 --> 01:40:53.513
Is the treatment working?

01:40:58.050 --> 01:40:59.051
No.

01:41:01.721 --> 01:41:03.055
No, it's not.

01:41:11.664 --> 01:41:12.765
I'm sorry.

01:41:15.034 --> 01:41:16.600
For all of this.

01:41:16.602 --> 01:41:18.771
No, no, no, no, sweetie.

01:41:20.139 --> 01:41:21.707
It's not your fault.

01:42:25.071 --> 01:42:27.171
Mom. Hey.

01:42:27.173 --> 01:42:28.973
Hey, Mom.

01:42:28.975 --> 01:42:31.443
What? What is it?
What is it, honey?

01:42:31.811 --> 01:42:33.779
Could you help me
with something?

01:42:38.084 --> 01:42:39.583
Are you guys in?

01:42:39.585 --> 01:42:41.087
Absolutely.

01:42:42.054 --> 01:42:43.055
Barb?

01:42:45.091 --> 01:42:46.757
Hell, yeah, I'm in.

01:42:47.693 --> 01:42:50.029
She's sedated.
We have a few more hours.

01:42:50.663 --> 01:42:51.797
We have time.

01:42:52.031 --> 01:42:53.097
It's done.

01:42:53.099 --> 01:42:54.567
They said yes.

01:42:56.135 --> 01:42:57.136
Okay.

01:42:57.770 --> 01:42:59.538
Let's do this.

01:43:10.683 --> 01:43:14.452
I've done all I'm doing
with this, Will. I'm done.

01:43:17.523 --> 01:43:19.125
Thank you.

01:43:20.559 --> 01:43:21.894
She's waking up.

01:43:26.632 --> 01:43:27.733
Hey, honey.

01:43:33.239 --> 01:43:34.505
Hey, sweetie, you did great!

01:43:34.507 --> 01:43:35.673
You really did.

01:43:35.675 --> 01:43:36.876
You did great.

01:43:40.913 --> 01:43:43.514
You did wonderful, baby.

01:43:43.516 --> 01:43:44.717
You did good.

01:43:45.885 --> 01:43:47.086
It's okay.

01:43:54.260 --> 01:43:56.228
We have something for you.

01:44:01.901 --> 01:44:04.537
<i>My beautiful,
bossy Stella.</i>

01:44:05.304 --> 01:44:08.074
<i>I guess it's true,
what that book of yours says.</i>

01:44:08.708 --> 01:44:11.177
<i>That the soul knows no time.</i>

01:44:12.678 --> 01:44:14.647
<i>My drug trial's not working.</i>

01:44:15.848 --> 01:44:18.916
<i>I want you to know
that this past month</i>

01:44:18.918 --> 01:44:20.720
<i>will last forever for me.</i>

01:44:21.620 --> 01:44:22.953
<i>My only regret is that</i>

01:44:22.955 --> 01:44:24.623
<i>you didn't get to see
your lights.</i>

01:45:19.712 --> 01:45:22.081
<i>I finally got you speechless.</i>

01:45:26.152 --> 01:45:28.318
<i>You know, people are always
saying if you love something,</i>

01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:30.289
<i>you have to learn
to let it go.</i>

01:45:31.690 --> 01:45:33.793
<i>I thought
that was such bullshit.</i>

01:45:35.828 --> 01:45:38.130
<i>Till I watched you almost die.</i>

01:45:38.864 --> 01:45:40.766
In that moment, Stella,

01:45:43.636 --> 01:45:45.304
nothing mattered to me.

01:45:46.939 --> 01:45:48.107
<i>Except you.</i>

01:45:52.945 --> 01:45:54.146
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:45:58.350 --> 01:45:59.952
<i>I don't wanna go.</i>

01:46:02.922 --> 01:46:05.257
<i>All I want is to be with you.</i>

01:46:09.061 --> 01:46:10.262
<i>I can't.</i>

01:46:12.331 --> 01:46:14.366
<i>I need you to be safe.</i>

01:46:15.234 --> 01:46:16.702
From me.

01:46:20.206 --> 01:46:22.341
I don't know what comes next,

01:46:23.042 --> 01:46:26.078
<i>but I don't regret
any of this.</i>

01:46:30.282 --> 01:46:32.118
Could you close your eyes?

01:46:33.419 --> 01:46:35.152
<i>I just don't know
if I can walk away</i>

01:46:35.154 --> 01:46:36.789
<i>if you're still looking at me.</i>

01:46:44.463 --> 01:46:45.764
<i>Please.</i>

01:47:03.082 --> 01:47:04.383
<i>I love you</i>

01:47:05.417 --> 01:47:07.153
<i>so much.</i>

01:47:35.981 --> 01:47:38.017
He left this for you.

01:49:09.208 --> 01:49:10.510
<i>Human touch.</i>

01:49:12.077 --> 01:49:14.481
Our first form
of communication.

01:49:15.114 --> 01:49:18.017
<i>Safety, security, comfort,</i>

01:49:18.585 --> 01:49:21.453
<i>all in the gentle caress
of a finger.</i>

01:49:22.454 --> 01:49:25.322
<i>Or at the brush of lips
on a soft cheek.</i>

01:49:25.324 --> 01:49:27.026
Hey, Stella.
You can't record that. No.

01:49:27.326 --> 01:49:29.259
It connects us
when we're happy...

01:49:31.297 --> 01:49:33.130
Abby, no.

01:49:33.132 --> 01:49:34.632
<i>...bolsters us
in times of fear...</i>

01:49:36.035 --> 01:49:37.570
Can you turn that off?

01:49:38.003 --> 01:49:40.839
...excites us
in times of passion...

01:49:41.373 --> 01:49:44.477
Ah. No. Stella, no.
Stop!

01:49:44.877 --> 01:49:46.845
...and love.

01:49:49.915 --> 01:49:51.616
We need that touch
from the one we love

01:49:51.618 --> 01:49:53.986
almost as much
as we need air to breathe.

01:49:55.622 --> 01:49:57.956
<i>But I never understood
the importance of touch.</i>

01:50:00.059 --> 01:50:01.561
<i>His touch.</i>

01:50:03.896 --> 01:50:05.532
<i>Until I couldn't have it.</i>

01:50:09.669 --> 01:50:12.371
So, if you're watching this

01:50:13.072 --> 01:50:14.473
and you're able,

01:50:17.510 --> 01:50:18.977
<i>touch him.</i>

01:50:19.679 --> 01:50:21.380
<i>Touch her.</i>

01:50:23.415 --> 01:50:25.918
<i>Life's too short
to waste a second.</i>

01:50:33.674 --> 01:50:38.674
