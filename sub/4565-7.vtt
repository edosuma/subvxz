00:08.274 --> 00:10.476
Why draw fruit?

00:10.478 --> 00:12.811
Let's draw
a real work of art.

00:12.813 --> 00:16.882
That's right.
Check out 48 lbs of nasty.

00:16.884 --> 00:18.384
Both: No!

00:18.386 --> 00:22.454
Well!
( chuckles )

00:22.456 --> 00:26.558
Looky here.
The male... Physique.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.927
Why thank you, art lady.

00:28.929 --> 00:30.929
Why aren't
we drawing lucas?

00:33.500 --> 00:35.467
Because nobody
looks like that.

00:36.970 --> 00:38.604
Get used to this.

00:38.606 --> 00:40.939
Get used
to this right now.

00:42.208 --> 00:45.444
When drawing a farkle,
start with the eyes.

00:45.446 --> 00:47.746
I think the eyes should go
straight to the gun show.

00:51.384 --> 00:54.319
Maya, you're supposed
to concentrate on the eyes.

00:54.321 --> 00:56.455
See, you know
what my problem is?
I don't listen.

00:56.457 --> 00:58.223
By the way,
you're drawing lucas.

00:59.325 --> 01:01.026
Oh.
( chuckles )

01:01.995 --> 01:04.263
Well, that's the first time

01:04.265 --> 01:05.531
I've ever done that.

01:10.837 --> 01:12.004
Do I need help?

01:13.473 --> 01:15.574
All right, I know these
are works in progress,

01:15.576 --> 01:16.909
But let's see
where we are.

01:16.911 --> 01:19.278
Maybe we'll become
famous artists.

01:19.280 --> 01:20.979
We'll go to paris,

01:20.981 --> 01:24.249
Drink coffee
in outdoor cafes.

01:24.251 --> 01:25.617
How do I look?

01:25.619 --> 01:28.687
( vocalizing tune )

01:34.894 --> 01:37.329
( humphs )

01:37.331 --> 01:38.997
Fine, make fun of me.

01:38.999 --> 01:42.568
I am a serious artist
who belongs in paris.

01:42.570 --> 01:44.570
<i>Bonjour, </i> lucas.

01:44.572 --> 01:46.638
( speaking
french )

01:54.647 --> 01:56.582
<i>Bonjour, </i> lucas.

01:59.385 --> 02:01.753
- Oh my gosh.
- See?  I am an artist.

02:01.755 --> 02:04.690
- I am finally something.
- Maya.

02:04.692 --> 02:06.925
( annoyed )
what a life I'm having.

02:06.927 --> 02:09.695
Maya.  My goodness.

02:09.697 --> 02:13.699
This is brilliant!

02:13.701 --> 02:16.401
Farkle is
in a bird's nest.

02:16.403 --> 02:18.737
It's a work
of surrealism, riley.

02:18.739 --> 02:21.707
It's how this artist's mind
views the subject.

02:21.709 --> 02:23.609
I'm a bird to you?

02:23.611 --> 02:26.645
No, you just...
Need to be protected.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.847
- You love me.
- Leave me alone.

02:30.016 --> 02:31.950
Maya, there's a school
exhibit coming up.

02:31.952 --> 02:33.619
I want one
of your pieces in it.

02:33.621 --> 02:35.721
What about my piece?
( chuckles )

02:36.990 --> 02:39.057
That's a cute top.

02:40.527 --> 02:42.094
No thanks, miss kossal.

02:42.096 --> 02:44.863
I don't draw for other people
to look at, but thank you.

02:44.865 --> 02:47.032
I'd appreciate you
thinking about it, okay?

02:51.004 --> 02:53.672
- Where you headed, farkle?
- Gym class.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.073
That should go well, right?

02:55.075 --> 02:58.243

They've been

auggie.

03:53.067 --> 03:54.666
Your artwork
would not hang

03:54.668 --> 03:56.001
On a single
refrigerator

03:56.003 --> 03:57.102
Outside this apartment.

03:57.104 --> 03:58.904
You said I was
a little genius.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.706
Oh, you are a
little genius.

04:00.708 --> 04:02.708
You said I was
a little
genius.

04:02.710 --> 04:06.144
Well, I had
no one to compare
you to, honey.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.814
Maya is going
to be a famous
artist

04:08.816 --> 04:10.983
And everybody
speaks french
but me.

04:10.985 --> 04:13.051
( speaking
french )

04:18.057 --> 04:20.058
You are going to
change the world

04:20.060 --> 04:22.160
With your
brilliant mind.

04:24.197 --> 04:27.099
You have
such a cute top.

04:28.735 --> 04:30.535
Are there any more
of these mashed potatoes?

04:30.537 --> 04:32.638
That's what you're thinking
about right now?

04:32.640 --> 04:35.073
Riley, this whole
what-am-I-good-at thing?

04:35.075 --> 04:37.809
I've been there
my whole life.
It's a waste of time.

04:39.445 --> 04:41.480
You know what's
not a waste of time?

04:41.482 --> 04:43.782
Mashed potatoes.

04:43.784 --> 04:46.518
You know why?
They never let you down.

04:47.553 --> 04:49.054
They're the best
in the world

04:49.056 --> 04:50.756
At what they do.

04:50.758 --> 04:52.924
So don't be mashed potatoes,

04:52.926 --> 04:54.960
Because they're better at that
than you could ever be.

04:56.596 --> 04:59.998
- How are you helping me?
- Can I eat a meal?

05:01.234 --> 05:03.735
What about you guys?
Do you have any talent?

05:03.737 --> 05:05.804
Did I inherit anything
from you two?

05:05.806 --> 05:07.973
( snorts )
should we tell her?

05:07.975 --> 05:10.108
( snorts )
you think they're ready?

05:11.177 --> 05:13.178
Your father has
a gift for...

05:13.180 --> 05:14.980
Gimme!  Gimme.
I'll take anything.

05:14.982 --> 05:17.082
...Close-up magic!

05:22.955 --> 05:24.756
- Hah?
- That's right.

05:24.758 --> 05:27.159
He's a close-up
magician.  Yay.

05:28.995 --> 05:31.530
What is a--
what is that?

05:31.532 --> 05:34.132
What is that?
Oh, I don't know.

05:34.134 --> 05:36.101
Maybe it's a little
something like...

05:36.103 --> 05:38.170
I go over
to this guy over here--

05:38.172 --> 05:39.938
Hi.  How are you?  Good.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.941
And then I ask
a little question like, "hey!

05:42.943 --> 05:46.044
Where's the salt?
Anybody seen the salt?"

05:46.046 --> 05:48.213
I don't see
the salt, daddy.
The salt's gone.

05:49.682 --> 05:51.550
Is it, auggie?
Is it gone?

05:51.552 --> 05:53.919
Or is it--
piddly pobbly pa-poom!

05:53.921 --> 05:56.722
( gasps )
what the...?

05:58.191 --> 06:00.826
- That was already there.
- I swear, riley

06:00.828 --> 06:02.127
I swear.

06:03.296 --> 06:05.564
Do it right now
with the pepper.

06:05.566 --> 06:08.066
Pepper?
Nobody could do pepper.

06:09.001 --> 06:11.903
Peppery poppily
pa-poom!

06:14.240 --> 06:16.742
Nobody could do pepper!

06:18.010 --> 06:20.045
Why aren't you famous?!

06:20.047 --> 06:22.247
See?  He's very good.

06:22.249 --> 06:24.149
You come from
a very talented family.

06:24.151 --> 06:26.118
Close-up magic?
Really?

06:26.120 --> 06:27.986
What am I supposed
to do with that?

06:27.988 --> 06:30.222
Mom, could you please
help me out with something

06:30.224 --> 06:32.991
That I could actually use?
Do you have a talent?

06:32.993 --> 06:35.093
- ( snickers )
- does she?

06:35.095 --> 06:37.729
( laughs )
does she?

06:37.731 --> 06:41.700
- Your mom--
- don't you dare.

06:41.702 --> 06:44.002
Your mom's hips don't lie!

06:46.939 --> 06:49.107
Cory matthews!

06:51.344 --> 06:53.078
Whoo-hoo!
Do it, mommy!

06:53.080 --> 06:56.214
No no no.
No, I am not gonna do it.

06:56.216 --> 06:58.183
- All right, fine, I'll do it.
- Okay, do it! Yeah!

06:58.185 --> 07:00.185
It goes a little something
like this.

07:00.187 --> 07:03.388
Ay yai yai yai,
ay yai yai yai,

07:03.390 --> 07:05.857
Ay yai yai yai,
ay yai,

07:05.859 --> 07:07.692
Ay yai yai yai.

07:07.694 --> 07:10.195
Hey, riley, pa-poom!

07:17.837 --> 07:19.337
All right,
future history makers,

07:19.339 --> 07:21.606
Welcome to career day.

07:21.608 --> 07:24.376
Now there are
a lot of ways to make
your mark on the world.

07:24.378 --> 07:27.646
- Hi, riley.
- Oh great, shakira is here.

07:28.948 --> 07:31.316
- Where's your mom?
- She won't be coming.

07:31.318 --> 07:34.686
- But she told you
she was coming.
- Yes, she did.

07:34.688 --> 07:37.189
Okay, guys,
our first guest today

07:37.191 --> 07:40.158
Is a lawyer,
and I likes her.

07:41.828 --> 07:45.197
Hey, lawyer lady.
How's about we go
out sometime?

07:46.098 --> 07:48.700
I get off work
every day at 3:15...

07:48.702 --> 07:50.902
Except tuesdays.
I got playground.

07:52.038 --> 07:54.139
So I am an attorney.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.975
I got here through a lot
of hard work in school.

07:56.977 --> 08:01.379
By the time I was your age,
I had 350 "a"s.

08:01.381 --> 08:04.416
-    <i>( knocks on door )</i>
<i>- your mom-- there she is.</i>

08:15.728 --> 08:17.863
Minkus.

08:17.865 --> 08:19.965
Topanga.

08:21.033 --> 08:23.802
- Stuart.
- Topanga.

08:26.005 --> 08:28.039
- Father.
- Farkle.

08:29.275 --> 08:31.209
Wait a minute.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.846
- Yes?
- He's your father?

08:34.848 --> 08:36.214
Look at us.

08:37.750 --> 08:40.385
Your name is
farkle minkus?

08:40.387 --> 08:42.220
Don't wear it out.

08:43.756 --> 08:45.190
I don't know
how you could.

08:47.260 --> 08:48.860
Sorry I'm late,
everybody.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.362
I had
helicopter problems,

08:50.364 --> 08:52.764
'cause I have
a helicopter.

08:52.766 --> 08:55.000
Do you have
a helicopter, cory?

08:55.002 --> 08:57.435
Nope.  Do you have
a topanga, minkus?

08:59.005 --> 09:01.907
Nope, because she chose you.

09:01.909 --> 09:03.275
I run minkus international,

09:03.277 --> 09:06.177
I have a helicopter,
and she chose you.

09:07.313 --> 09:10.081
Stuart, please.
Aren't we a little too evolved

09:10.083 --> 09:11.383
To still be competing
with each other?

09:11.385 --> 09:13.318
( laughs )
of course.

09:13.320 --> 09:14.986
( laughs )
of course.

09:15.955 --> 09:17.389
- Both: Go.
- Between the two of us,

09:17.391 --> 09:21.426
Riley and I have
1260 "a"s.  Ha!

09:22.428 --> 09:24.095
That's remarkable, topanga.

09:24.097 --> 09:25.096
Between the two of us,

09:25.098 --> 09:28.199
Farkle and I have 1261.

09:28.201 --> 09:29.467
- Ha!
- Ha!

09:32.038 --> 09:34.039
( screams )

09:34.041 --> 09:35.774
I-- I had to, topanga.

09:35.776 --> 09:37.943
He's a lot smarter
than I am.

09:39.211 --> 09:41.346
But what's more important
to me than anything...

09:42.448 --> 09:44.983
Is that I have this guy.
Come up here, son.

09:44.985 --> 09:47.419
Topanga:
<i>Come up here, daughter.</i>

09:47.421 --> 09:49.020
Look how tall she is.

09:49.022 --> 09:51.122
She's been taller than me
since the day she was born.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.795
Well, very nice.
Good for you guys.

09:56.797 --> 09:59.264
So this is what career day
is really all about.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.966
Yeah, I love it
every year.

10:00.968 --> 10:02.867
I'm sorry, maya.

10:02.869 --> 10:05.170
Maybe your mom
just got a little busy.

10:05.172 --> 10:07.339
- Are you okay?
- I'm always okay.

10:08.941 --> 10:10.241
Yeah, thanks.

10:11.911 --> 10:13.778
So these are
the two ladies

10:13.780 --> 10:15.814
You tell me
keep chasing you, huh?

10:16.949 --> 10:20.051
( whispers ) please.

10:20.053 --> 10:22.821
- Yes sir, it is us.
- I'm not doing it.

10:24.123 --> 10:26.024
Yes sir, it's us.

10:26.026 --> 10:28.026
We hope that one day one
of us will be lucky enough

10:28.028 --> 10:29.995
To become the future
mrs. Farkle minkus

10:29.997 --> 10:31.529
And have a lot
of baby minkii.

10:39.171 --> 10:41.806
Why won't you
show your art?

10:41.808 --> 10:43.508
Because I'm--

10:43.510 --> 10:46.344
I'm fine believing
that nothing much is
going to happen for me.

10:46.346 --> 10:48.046
Otherwise
I'm full of hope.

10:48.048 --> 10:50.248
You hope for things,
you get disappointed.

10:50.250 --> 10:53.051
What reason could
your mom have for
not showing up, maya?

10:53.053 --> 10:55.587
You're right,
I did expect her.

10:55.589 --> 10:58.156
And I didn't.
See?  Only one of us
is disappointed.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.925
And only one of us will
never let this go.
You know that.

11:00.927 --> 11:03.895
I don't expect out of life
what you expect, riley.

11:03.897 --> 11:08.233
- What do I expect?
- You expect... Good things.

11:08.235 --> 11:10.869
You expect people
to keep promises

11:10.871 --> 11:13.138
And people to show up.

11:13.140 --> 11:17.242
- You don't?
- Riley, I'm not one
of those dreamers like you.

11:17.244 --> 11:19.277
If your mom saw your art,

11:19.279 --> 11:23.214
Doesn't it make sense
that she'd be proud of you?

11:23.216 --> 11:25.917
Yeah, it makes sense to you.

11:25.919 --> 11:28.219
Riley, you need
to be okay with this.

11:28.221 --> 11:31.423
Do you understand
that finally something
is beyond your control?

11:31.425 --> 11:34.025
Look, I know
you can't control
your twisted need

11:34.027 --> 11:35.560
To fix people's lives.

11:39.231 --> 11:41.199
I'm begging you.

11:52.912 --> 11:55.947
- The korean war.
- Genghis khan.

11:55.949 --> 11:58.183
- What?
- I just wanted to see
what would happen.

12:00.186 --> 12:04.322
Hello, cory matthews.
I am so sorry for interrupting.

12:04.324 --> 12:07.225
- ( mutters ) oh no.
- Cory:  <i>Nothing to</i>
<i>forgive, katy.</i>

12:07.227 --> 12:11.129
Class, this is
maya's mother, katy hart.

12:11.131 --> 12:13.231
Mom, what are you doing?
It was yesterday.

12:13.233 --> 12:16.901
Yesterday I was
unable to attend
your little job fair.

12:16.903 --> 12:20.038
- Career day.
- Yesterday I was trapped...

12:20.040 --> 12:22.674
In my vehicle...

12:22.676 --> 12:25.543
In the rushing flood waters

12:25.545 --> 12:28.246
Of the mighty colorado river!

12:31.984 --> 12:34.586
To make matters worse,
I just found out

12:34.588 --> 12:37.622
I was about to have
a baby any second.

12:37.624 --> 12:42.160
So I crawled myself
through the sunroof

12:42.162 --> 12:46.164
And I said,
"let's do this thing."

12:47.066 --> 12:50.135
Then I commenced

12:50.137 --> 12:53.204
To deliver my own baby

12:53.206 --> 12:55.173
Until finally

12:55.175 --> 12:58.176
I heard that wonderful,

12:58.178 --> 13:00.211
Magical sound.

13:01.580 --> 13:03.014
( pops )

13:05.484 --> 13:08.119
( mimicking baby crying )

13:10.956 --> 13:14.159
"mama?
Are you my mama?"

13:16.128 --> 13:18.196
- Maya?
- Soap opera.

13:18.198 --> 13:20.532
She was auditioning
for a soap opera.

13:20.534 --> 13:23.301
Can you believe
I didn't get it?

13:23.303 --> 13:24.536
Kids: Yes!

13:25.738 --> 13:27.739
( laughs ) yes.

13:27.741 --> 13:29.707
I am an actress.

13:29.709 --> 13:33.144
Are there any questions
I can answer for anyone?

13:33.146 --> 13:35.180
Ah, yes, the farkle.

13:35.182 --> 13:37.215
Why are you wearing
a waitress outfit?

13:37.217 --> 13:39.050
Anyone else?

13:39.052 --> 13:43.021
Yes, the pretty,
young man right there.

13:43.023 --> 13:45.123
Yeah, thanks.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.759
Um, why are you wearing
a waitress outfit?

13:49.161 --> 13:51.362
My dad says actors are
just a bunch of people

13:51.364 --> 13:54.065
- Who never grew up.
- ( chuckles ) what does
your dad do?

13:54.067 --> 13:56.267
He's a director.

13:57.703 --> 14:00.071
Is he?
Well, I'm sure

14:00.073 --> 14:02.173
Your father never
gave me a job either,

14:02.175 --> 14:05.510
Which is the real reason
I wear this outfit every day.

14:10.115 --> 14:13.218
Well, I'll just be
going now.

14:24.797 --> 14:27.298
No no no.
I shouldn't have come.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.133
You did fine,
you showed up.

14:29.135 --> 14:31.135
I showed up a day late.

14:31.137 --> 14:33.171
I couldn't even get
that order right.

14:33.173 --> 14:35.773
I know that my dad
appreciated the effort.

14:35.775 --> 14:37.308
Hi, mom.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.444
Hey, maya.

14:39.446 --> 14:40.778
Could I ask you
a favor?

14:40.780 --> 14:43.147
Of course, anything.

14:43.149 --> 14:45.250
I think it works
best for us

14:45.252 --> 14:47.518
When you go on
your imaginary auditions

14:47.520 --> 14:49.454
And chase our
imaginary father.

14:49.456 --> 14:51.189
I appreciate
your coming,

14:51.191 --> 14:53.091
I do.

14:53.093 --> 14:55.093
And I'm not humiliated.

14:55.095 --> 14:56.694
I'm not.  I'm--

14:56.696 --> 14:58.062
I'm okay.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.130
( sighs )

14:59.132 --> 15:00.598
You okay?

15:03.269 --> 15:05.570
Good.

15:09.775 --> 15:13.678
Yeah, this is
just how we are.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.280
For me to think
any other way

15:15.282 --> 15:19.150
Is just acting,
and I'm not that good.

15:19.152 --> 15:23.087
I was raised by topanga
and cory matthews.

15:23.089 --> 15:25.456
They're maniacs.

15:25.458 --> 15:28.126
They'd walk through
an avalanche for friendship,

15:28.128 --> 15:30.428
For the sake of family.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.196
I got that from them.

15:33.632 --> 15:36.301
I got a talent.
How about that?

15:37.636 --> 15:39.871
You can't fix this,
riley.

15:44.877 --> 15:46.844
Yes, I can.

15:46.846 --> 15:49.213
There is an art show here,
tomorrow night.

15:49.215 --> 15:51.182
You need to be there.

15:51.184 --> 15:53.451
- Sure.
- I expect you there.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.219
I understand.

15:56.722 --> 15:58.423
Don't disappoint us.

16:02.928 --> 16:04.362
Drawing a woman's face

16:04.364 --> 16:06.230
Is different
than drawing a man's.

16:06.232 --> 16:08.466
Look for subtle differences.

16:08.468 --> 16:09.767
The lips are different.

16:09.769 --> 16:11.769
No matter what,
don't get mad at me, okay?

16:11.771 --> 16:13.171
I could never.

16:13.173 --> 16:14.639
To paint
a young woman's lips,

16:14.641 --> 16:16.874
She needs to stop
flapping them.

16:16.876 --> 16:19.510
Because if I have any talent
at all, it's this,

16:19.512 --> 16:21.846
- So don't get mad at me.
- I could never.

16:21.848 --> 16:23.481
Because when
the mouth is moving,

16:23.483 --> 16:25.583
It will affect
all the sketches.

16:25.585 --> 16:28.319
And they all come out
like this.

16:30.923 --> 16:33.157
Except for this one.

16:34.593 --> 16:36.761
You don't listen
to a word I say, do you?

16:36.763 --> 16:38.429
Uh, it's not because
I'm disrespectful.

16:38.431 --> 16:40.865
It's because you're
an artist.

16:40.867 --> 16:43.301
I'm glad you decided
to display your work.

16:43.303 --> 16:44.902
I got your note
in my teacher's box.

16:46.772 --> 16:50.174
That's the thing
you're not supposed
to get mad at.

16:50.876 --> 16:52.643
The exhibit starts
at 6:00.

16:52.645 --> 16:54.645
It's thrilling seeing
your art displayed,

16:54.647 --> 16:56.247
You won't regret it.

16:58.283 --> 17:00.284
You don't listen
to a word I say, do you?

17:00.286 --> 17:02.987
I-it's not because
I'm disrespectful.

17:02.989 --> 17:04.622
It's because
you're an artist.

17:05.624 --> 17:07.225
Yeah?

17:07.227 --> 17:08.359
Then let me
paint you something.

17:09.962 --> 17:12.230
( gasps )

17:12.232 --> 17:13.431
( sighs )

17:16.802 --> 17:18.436
Okay.

17:18.438 --> 17:19.937
Maya, I am your best friend

17:19.939 --> 17:22.206
And I will always do
my best by you,

17:22.208 --> 17:23.608
No matter what you...

17:23.610 --> 17:25.243
Say.

17:28.881 --> 17:32.917
And who made you
the king of friendship?

17:32.919 --> 17:35.520
( chuckles )

17:35.522 --> 17:40.324
I did, I made myself
the king of friendship.

17:40.326 --> 17:43.528
And this would be
my first act as a king.

17:49.902 --> 17:50.902
Why won't you
leave this alone?!

17:50.904 --> 17:52.470
I don't know how!

17:57.709 --> 17:59.310
Whoa!

18:02.481 --> 18:04.882
Riley...

18:04.884 --> 18:07.752
This is the most authentic piece
you've done all semester.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.954
Now clean it up.

18:09.956 --> 18:11.355
See you tonight,
maya.

18:14.993 --> 18:16.761
One other thing--

18:16.763 --> 18:18.696
I invited your mom.

18:23.602 --> 18:25.403
( sighs )

18:49.661 --> 18:51.028
How's it going?

18:51.030 --> 18:52.029
It's going fine.

18:52.031 --> 18:53.731
What does
your mom think?

18:56.001 --> 18:58.069
She never showed up.

18:58.071 --> 18:59.770
It's just you guys.

18:59.772 --> 19:02.773
Are you telling me
your mom never showed up?

19:02.775 --> 19:04.976
No.

19:04.978 --> 19:06.577
But of course you did.

19:06.579 --> 19:08.412
( chuckles )
hey, maya.

19:08.414 --> 19:10.681
Wow, you really have
some talent.

19:10.683 --> 19:12.049
Look at that place.

19:12.051 --> 19:14.619
I bet it's got
great mashed potatoes.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.054
Look at that lady,

19:17.056 --> 19:18.756
Why can you
only see half of her?

19:19.758 --> 19:20.825
( muffled ) oh.

19:36.875 --> 19:39.443
( emphatically )
get out of my way.

19:43.582 --> 19:45.983
Did you think
I wouldn't hunt you down?

19:45.985 --> 19:47.985
No, I was pretty sure
you would.

19:47.987 --> 19:49.353
You want a tuna melt?

19:49.355 --> 19:51.822
No, because I'm supposed
to be somewhere,

19:51.824 --> 19:53.357
And so are you.

19:53.359 --> 19:55.059
You know,
all I do with maya

19:55.061 --> 19:57.995
Is disappoint her.

19:57.997 --> 20:01.532
Here's what's funny,
you're not disappointing
her at all.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.100
You're only
disappointing me.

20:03.102 --> 20:05.970
I came to school
and embarrassed her.

20:05.972 --> 20:07.939
I pretend I'm fancy,
but I'm not.

20:07.941 --> 20:10.942
I thought I had
a good marriage,
but I didn't.

20:10.944 --> 20:14.812
I pretend to have
a career, and I don't.

20:14.814 --> 20:16.614
I love that little girl

20:16.616 --> 20:17.548
And I won't pretend
with her.

20:21.019 --> 20:22.987
You need to go to her.

20:22.989 --> 20:24.755
( chuckles ) no.

20:24.757 --> 20:26.757
You saw what happens
when I do.

20:26.759 --> 20:29.126
You need to go to her.

20:30.696 --> 20:32.930
Riley, what does your dad
do for a living?

20:32.932 --> 20:35.099
- Teacher.
- And mom?

20:35.101 --> 20:36.701
- Lawyer.
- And me?

20:36.703 --> 20:37.969
Actress?

20:37.971 --> 20:40.805
Waitress, riley.

20:40.807 --> 20:42.106
And people tend to stay

20:42.108 --> 20:44.408
At the same level
as their parents,

20:44.410 --> 20:46.510
And I want more for her
than coming home

20:46.512 --> 20:49.714
With those little arms of hers
covered in pancake syrup.

20:51.717 --> 20:55.653
Maya's very lucky to have you.
Don't think I don't know that.

20:55.655 --> 20:58.089
And I am offering you
a tuna melt

20:58.091 --> 21:01.993
To show my gratitude.
Yes or no?

21:02.995 --> 21:05.062
( sighs )

21:07.165 --> 21:09.133
You guys really don't
have to stay.

21:09.135 --> 21:12.069
Are you kidding?
We love supporting

21:12.071 --> 21:13.070
The middle school
art scene.

21:13.072 --> 21:14.939
Yeah, we even bought
a drawing.

21:14.941 --> 21:17.642
You have to wonder
who this silly,
little weirdo is.

21:19.778 --> 21:21.479
Aw...

21:21.481 --> 21:23.748
It's our silly,
little weirdo.

21:25.050 --> 21:26.851
Thank you
for staying with maya.

21:26.853 --> 21:28.819
Always.

21:33.091 --> 21:34.659
I couldn't
get her to come

21:34.661 --> 21:36.594
And I'm very
disappointed.

21:36.596 --> 21:38.195
I know,
you expect too much.

21:38.197 --> 21:40.765
This is hard on me.

21:40.767 --> 21:42.633
You need a hug, darling?

21:45.971 --> 21:48.039
Maya, I was wrong.

21:48.041 --> 21:50.007
No, riley,
you were right.

21:50.009 --> 21:53.077
I'm very confused.

21:53.079 --> 21:56.047
I showed my work.
People liked it.

21:56.049 --> 21:59.250
It made me feel like I could
be something someday.

21:59.252 --> 22:01.986
You will be.
You are now.

22:01.988 --> 22:03.554
Thank you, riley.

22:03.556 --> 22:04.955
You're welcome.

22:04.957 --> 22:07.591
Do you want half
a tuna melt?

22:09.528 --> 22:10.594
You know why she gave
this to you?

22:10.596 --> 22:12.063
Why?

22:12.065 --> 22:13.998
She knows it's
my favorite thing there.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.933
She knew that you'd
share with me.

22:15.935 --> 22:18.169
I'd be happy to give you
the whole thing.

22:18.171 --> 22:20.171
I know you would.

22:23.075 --> 22:25.142
I'll be just fine
with half.

22:33.985 --> 22:36.754
And riley...

22:36.756 --> 22:38.055
For your excellence
in your display

22:38.057 --> 22:40.257
Of unwavering hope for others,

22:40.259 --> 22:41.559
I'm giving you an "a."

22:42.694 --> 22:44.095
Ha!

22:45.030 --> 22:46.630
- What?
- Can he do that?

22:46.632 --> 22:50.267
- No, you can't do that.
- I does whatever she wants.

22:50.269 --> 22:52.103
Yeah, so would I.

22:52.105 --> 22:55.039
I come from
a very talented family.

22:55.041 --> 22:56.607
What am I talented at?

22:56.609 --> 22:58.142
You're gonna find it
someday, honey.

23:04.082 --> 23:06.083
( singing in italian )

23:25.137 --> 23:26.337
Nah.

23:28.039 --> 23:29.039
Hey!

23:29.041 --> 23:31.108
( cheering )
