WEBVTT

00:14.473 --> 00:17.215
Crichton:
Would you look at the
size of that thing?

00:20.605 --> 00:22.891
Pilot:
Every sweep confirms

00:22.982 --> 00:25.223
that is a dead ship.

00:25.318 --> 00:27.149
And you're sure it isn't Crais'.

00:27.236 --> 00:29.147
Positive.

00:29.238 --> 00:32.196
What is another Peacekeeper
ship doing in the uncharted
territories?

00:32.283 --> 00:33.864
Don't know. Something's wrong.

00:33.951 --> 00:36.943
Yeah, no kidding.
Like, shouldn't we be doing
warp 1,000 by now?

00:37.038 --> 00:39.120
Think how big the winner of
this battle must be.

00:39.207 --> 00:42.324
I'm with John. I say we leave
this tomb immediately.

00:42.418 --> 00:46.957
And I say that there is
information on her data spools
that could lead us home.

00:47.048 --> 00:49.915
There may be weapons on board
we can use.

00:50.009 --> 00:52.045
And I need to know who she is.

00:52.136 --> 00:56.254
What? Who cares what
her name is?

00:56.349 --> 00:59.091
It's the Zelbinion.

01:02.146 --> 01:03.977
Crichton:
So, what is it with
the Zelbinion?

01:04.065 --> 01:07.774
It is the most feared ship in
the Peacekeeper armada.

01:07.860 --> 01:10.317
Yeah, well, clearly somebody
didn't get that message.

01:10.404 --> 01:13.316
She's been missing in battle
for over 100 cycles.

01:13.407 --> 01:17.446
Zhaan:
Aeryn, confirming there is
breathable air beyond the connection hatch.

01:17.536 --> 01:20.778
Pilot cautions you remain
starboard and high.

01:20.873 --> 01:25.162
Most of the vacuum damage was
sustained in attack from below.

01:32.134 --> 01:33.385
Is this a good idea?

01:33.469 --> 01:37.337
You can stay behind if you
wish, but I have questions.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.012
Ready?

01:59.412 --> 02:03.280
Crichton:
I can't believe you lived on a
ship like this, your whole life.

02:04.292 --> 02:07.125
When you told me endless
tales of your home,

02:07.211 --> 02:11.329
you spoke of forests and
rivers and valleys.

02:11.424 --> 02:15.588
Well, l was thinking of walls,
not unlike these.

02:15.678 --> 02:18.465
Well, I'm sure it looks
better with carpeting.

02:26.230 --> 02:29.313
D'argo:
This ship is legendary,
even in my culture.

02:29.400 --> 02:31.265
It was thought invincible.

02:31.360 --> 02:33.942
Yeah, well, just ask
Leonardo Di Caprio.

02:34.030 --> 02:36.362
Even the big ones go down.

02:48.336 --> 02:49.746
Whoa!

02:57.428 --> 02:59.214
Deep space desiccation.

03:22.078 --> 03:23.989
I expected you to go
looting, Rygel.

03:24.080 --> 03:28.494
Looﬁng?
I am Dominar of over six
hundred billion subjects.

03:28.584 --> 03:30.870
I shouldn't stoop so low.

03:30.961 --> 03:35.830
If I recall, you stooped for
the last three derelict ships
we came upon,

03:35.925 --> 03:37.381
or was it four?

03:38.677 --> 03:40.838
(rumbling sigh)

03:40.930 --> 03:43.296
Is something bothering you?

03:43.391 --> 03:48.306
When I was ripped from my
throne over a hundred and
thirty cycles ago,

03:48.396 --> 03:52.389
this was the first vessel
l was tortured on.

03:57.571 --> 04:00.358
It's no better in here.

04:05.621 --> 04:08.488
Such a large ship and
nothing to salvage.

04:08.582 --> 04:13.076
How disappointing that all
the scavengers have robbed
us of our glory.

04:15.339 --> 04:18.172
This navigation console has
been completely destroyed.

04:18.259 --> 04:20.545
There are no galactic
star charts here.

04:20.636 --> 04:22.467
This excursion is over.

04:22.555 --> 04:24.216
Wait.

04:24.306 --> 04:25.716
What about this console?

04:25.808 --> 04:27.799
The lights are still on.

04:30.479 --> 04:32.720
Someone has regenerated
communications.

04:32.815 --> 04:35.557
(growling)

04:35.651 --> 04:40.315
Recently? Or do you guys have
like, the best car batteries
of all time?

04:50.791 --> 04:51.997
(grunting)

04:52.084 --> 04:53.745
Aeryn! l'm blocked.

05:00.384 --> 05:01.590
No!

05:04.054 --> 05:06.306
Officer Sun.

05:08.559 --> 05:10.891
The escaped prisoners.

05:10.978 --> 05:13.060
(growling)

05:14.064 --> 05:16.020
Crichton:
How does she know us?

05:16.400 --> 05:18.140
Aeryn?

05:18.235 --> 05:20.396
Because she is from Crais' ship.

05:33.292 --> 05:35.578
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut...

05:35.669 --> 05:39.036
A radiation wave hit and I got
shot through a wormhole...

05:39.131 --> 05:41.167
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe

05:41.258 --> 05:42.964
on a ship-- a living ship

05:43.052 --> 05:45.213
Full of strange alien
life-forms...

05:45.304 --> 05:46.339
Help me, help me.

05:46.430 --> 05:47.670
Listen, please.

05:47.765 --> 05:49.847
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

05:49.934 --> 05:54.098
...being hunted by an insane
military commander...

05:54.188 --> 05:56.224
...doing everything I can...

05:56.315 --> 05:58.727
I'm just looking for
a way home.

06:17.753 --> 06:22.213
Aeryn:
You will remain in review stance
until I dismiss, understood?

06:24.093 --> 06:25.299
Name.

06:25.386 --> 06:27.217
Division.

06:27.304 --> 06:29.044
Assignment.

06:29.139 --> 06:30.219
Gilina Renaez.

06:30.307 --> 06:31.717
Speak up.

06:31.809 --> 06:34.175
Tranco Support.
Maintenance Provost.

06:34.270 --> 06:36.010
Chin up, eyes locked.

06:36.105 --> 06:38.266
Crichton:
Why don't you give it a rest,
Miss Drill Sergeant?

06:38.357 --> 06:40.769
Can't you see she's going to
pass out?

06:44.572 --> 06:45.982
I'm not like her.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.688
Not remotely.

06:47.783 --> 06:49.774
She is a tech.

06:49.868 --> 06:51.153
Crichton:
Not a soldier, right?

06:51.245 --> 06:53.327
No weapons, so why not
lighten up?

06:53.414 --> 06:55.496
More flies with honey.
That kind of thing.

06:55.583 --> 06:57.198
You clearly do not understand.

06:57.293 --> 07:01.957
She is from Crais' ship;
that means he is nearby.

07:02.047 --> 07:06.290
She knows exactly who we are
and would consider it
her duty to lie to us.

07:08.721 --> 07:10.211
Point taken.

07:10.306 --> 07:14.390
But if she drops, you're not
going to get your answers.

07:15.394 --> 07:17.885
This is my world, John.

07:17.980 --> 07:20.187
Don't interfere.

07:23.277 --> 07:26.019
Still alive?
How is that possible?

07:26.113 --> 07:28.024
She can't be from the
original crew.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.071
I don't have those answers.

07:30.159 --> 07:33.242
| suggest you go over and
ask them yourself.

07:33.329 --> 07:34.614
To that ship?

07:34.705 --> 07:36.036
Never.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.954
Never again.

07:38.542 --> 07:40.203
Ohh!

07:40.294 --> 07:42.285
How long have we known
each other, Rygel?

07:42.379 --> 07:45.917
Long enough for me to see your
blue backside meditating,

07:46.008 --> 07:48.670
but not long enough for
you to touch me.

07:49.845 --> 07:52.587
Confront your demons, Rygel.

07:52.681 --> 07:55.593
Or they will chase you from
the shadows to the pyre.

07:55.684 --> 07:59.472
(rumbling sigh)

08:02.107 --> 08:05.349
Renaez:
Captain Crais didn't want to
delay his search for you.

08:05.444 --> 08:11.735
So after coming upon the
Zelbinion, he ordered my unit
over for a full tech survey.

08:12.785 --> 08:15.197
What happened to the
rest of your unit?

08:20.459 --> 08:25.670
Two solar days after
arriving, another ship
came out of nowhere.

08:25.756 --> 08:28.418
I'd never seen such
a weapon before.

08:28.509 --> 08:32.627
I barely had time to escape
before they incinerated
our marauder transport.

08:33.681 --> 08:35.091
It's the Sheyang.

08:35.182 --> 08:37.798
There's evidence of their work
all over the ship.

08:37.893 --> 08:39.349
Could they have done all this?

08:39.436 --> 08:43.349
Hardly.
The Sheyang are nothing more
than opportunistic foragers.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.556
Aeryn:
Can you tell me what
happened here?

08:45.651 --> 08:48.563
How the Zelbinion died?

08:48.654 --> 08:49.769
(sighs)

08:49.863 --> 08:52.354
Long before we arrived,

08:52.449 --> 08:56.362
other scavengers pried loose
the data spools.

08:56.453 --> 08:59.286
There is no record.

09:00.499 --> 09:03.332
Officer Sun, I think you
should know,

09:03.419 --> 09:10.336
I consider you a traitor,
therefore worthy of the
punishment it merits.

09:13.387 --> 09:16.254
But as a Sebacean,

09:16.348 --> 09:21.809
I believe you are as deserving
as l to know the truth about
a cultural treasure.

09:21.895 --> 09:25.262
I am not lying when I say

09:25.357 --> 09:27.939
I do not know.

10:01.351 --> 10:03.307
D'argo:
I will investigate the
radiant chamber.

10:03.395 --> 10:04.976
I'll meet you at the
next junction.

10:05.063 --> 10:07.315
We'll wait for you, D'argo.

10:18.202 --> 10:20.158
I can't believe you're
not Sebacean.

10:20.245 --> 10:24.113
Human. It's kind of like
Sebacean, but we haven't
conquered other worlds yet,

10:24.208 --> 10:26.824
so we just kick the crap
out of each other.

10:28.504 --> 10:33.089
Thank you for stopping her
from killing me today.

10:33.175 --> 10:36.667
Oh, yeah, well, I try to
save a life a day.

10:36.762 --> 10:39.003
Usually it's my own.

10:54.613 --> 10:57.400
Oh, man.

10:57.491 --> 10:59.482
If you guys only used your
know-how to...

10:59.576 --> 11:00.907
To what?

11:00.994 --> 11:04.202
To fulfill your vision
of who we should be?

11:05.791 --> 11:07.702
To do good.

11:07.793 --> 11:10.250
We are Peacekeepers.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.919
Other cultures hire us
to keep order,

11:13.006 --> 11:14.291
to keep harmony.

11:14.383 --> 11:18.877
Rygel:
As well as assassinations,
torture, kidnap.

11:18.971 --> 11:20.256
( snorting )

11:20.347 --> 11:21.462
( screams )

11:22.933 --> 11:24.639
Knock it off, weasel.

11:24.726 --> 11:27.513
l've barely got used to sharing
my accommodation

11:27.604 --> 11:30.141
with one of these abominations.

11:30.232 --> 11:32.723
Dispel the thought of two!

12:06.310 --> 12:08.392
Male voice:
Hello, Rygel.

12:09.605 --> 12:11.436
(whimpering softly)

12:11.523 --> 12:14.230
Welcome home.

12:29.249 --> 12:32.207
D'argo:
Everything I see
confirms her story.

12:32.294 --> 12:36.333
There aren't even any
wire collars left in the
weapons control room.

12:36.423 --> 12:39.836
This vessel has been gutted
to worthlessness.

12:39.927 --> 12:41.667
Renaez:
Oh, no!

12:41.762 --> 12:43.753
He's from my unit.

12:44.973 --> 12:47.840
I knew him.

12:47.935 --> 12:50.847
D'argo:
Sheyang victim.
Burnt to death.

12:52.314 --> 12:53.929
Officer Kranda.

12:54.024 --> 12:55.935
Kranda?

13:02.532 --> 13:05.990
What was he doing guarding
the likes of you?

13:06.078 --> 13:07.614
This is grots' work.

13:07.704 --> 13:11.572
Your whole unit was demoted
after your defection.

13:13.085 --> 13:16.248
They can only be reinstated
upon your death.

13:23.303 --> 13:26.261
Come on. Let's get outta here.

13:32.229 --> 13:33.765
Pilot:
Excuse me, Zhaan.

13:33.855 --> 13:37.689
Could you check scan vector
gappa and tell me what you see?

13:38.318 --> 13:42.311
I'm... I'm not sure.

13:42.406 --> 13:46.866
I think it's a ship trying just
to stay out of sensor range.

13:46.952 --> 13:48.192
A...

13:48.286 --> 13:50.322
Sheyang ship?

13:52.582 --> 13:54.959
( grunting )
Why are the Sheyangs back?!

13:55.043 --> 13:56.328
What didn't you tell us?!

13:56.420 --> 13:59.287
If this one doesn't cooperate,
kill her.

13:59.381 --> 14:00.962
Is that why you're still alive?

14:01.049 --> 14:02.835
'cause you cooperated
with the enemy?!

14:02.926 --> 14:05.383
I am not the traitor.
You are.

14:05.470 --> 14:06.220
Tell me!

14:06.304 --> 14:07.805
Crichton:
Stop it!

14:07.889 --> 14:09.299
That is enough!

14:11.351 --> 14:13.728
She knew they were coming back.

14:13.812 --> 14:14.801
She knew.

14:14.896 --> 14:16.432
That's enough.

14:20.318 --> 14:22.400
She's not a traitor.

14:22.487 --> 14:24.318
Not by a long shot.

14:24.406 --> 14:26.442
Crais never gave her a chance.

14:27.951 --> 14:30.613
Not like the chance
we're giving you.

14:33.874 --> 14:38.618
I hid, while the Sheyangs
filled their ship to capacity.

14:40.547 --> 14:43.960
They said they were going to
come back for the D.S.

14:44.051 --> 14:46.087
Is that "Defense Shield"?

14:46.178 --> 14:48.260
It's not operational.

14:48.346 --> 14:51.088
But it's the least damaged
part of the ship.

14:51.183 --> 14:52.263
Let's go. Move.

14:52.350 --> 14:52.975
(grunting)

14:53.060 --> 14:54.550
Go.

14:54.644 --> 14:55.895
Situation.

14:55.979 --> 14:58.595
Their plasma conductor
is targeted on us.

15:00.734 --> 15:03.726
Let's signal our intent to
leave and then depart
without incident.

15:03.820 --> 15:05.481
Impossible with the Sheyang.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.358
If they sense strength,
they flee.

15:07.449 --> 15:10.407
Weakness, then they attack
without mercy.

15:10.494 --> 15:12.109
Then we get the others aboard,

15:12.204 --> 15:14.115
we decouple and then attempt
to Starburst.

15:14.206 --> 15:18.950
They have the ability to
destroy us before we even
get ten metras.

15:19.044 --> 15:24.289
But we have no offensive
capabilities, nothing to
signal strength.

15:24.382 --> 15:26.338
I know.

15:28.261 --> 15:32.174
Renaez:
No, this panel is useless.

15:35.644 --> 15:39.557
But if we could breach the
connections from this side
to the other,

15:39.648 --> 15:42.355
we could make the defense
screen operational.

15:42.442 --> 15:45.275
Do it.

15:45.362 --> 15:48.354
Officer Sun, I know you're
not a tech, but...

15:48.448 --> 15:50.655
Just tell me.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.950
It all depends on the
power reserves.

15:55.914 --> 15:57.905
l-it's going to take
eight arns, minimum.

15:57.999 --> 15:59.830
Eight arns?

15:59.918 --> 16:01.783
No, no, no, I know what
she's talking about.

16:01.878 --> 16:06.338
It's a progressive power draw,
so the fibre pattern has to be
maintained in sequence.

16:06.424 --> 16:08.380
That takes time.

16:08.468 --> 16:09.844
Right?

16:10.512 --> 16:11.968
Yeah.

16:14.224 --> 16:16.260
Eight arns.

16:17.310 --> 16:20.347
The Sheyang could fire
at any moment.

16:23.817 --> 16:28.436
Male voice:
This new ship makes no move
to defend itself.

16:29.531 --> 16:32.318
(laughing)

16:32.409 --> 16:38.826
When was the last time you
saw a Leviathan in the
territories, Teurac?

16:38.915 --> 16:43.534
Even you, at your age have
never claimed such a prize.

16:43.628 --> 16:47.587
Yes. it is a fortunate time.

16:47.674 --> 16:52.168
Ripe. Defenseless. Mine.

16:52.262 --> 16:54.753
Evran!

16:54.848 --> 16:56.429
Prepare to attack!

16:56.516 --> 16:59.724
The Sheyang have initiated
their weapons countdown.

16:59.811 --> 17:01.142
They're going to need
some help.

17:01.229 --> 17:03.185
It's too late.

17:06.860 --> 17:11.604
If Moya becomes severely
damaged, we may need to
retreat to the Zelbinion.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.279
D'argo? Zhaan?

17:13.366 --> 17:17.450
Moya and l are very
afraid of fire.

17:27.255 --> 17:30.042
What I wouldn't give for
just one Kkore Cannon.

17:30.133 --> 17:33.045
One Wetox missile.

17:33.136 --> 17:36.003
(snarling and panting)

17:39.309 --> 17:43.427
I spit on your grave,
you sons of cowards!

17:43.521 --> 17:45.978
l rip out your throats!

17:46.066 --> 17:52.312
(speaking native tongue)

17:52.405 --> 17:53.485
Pilot...

17:53.573 --> 17:55.234
transmit his image to
the Sheyang vessel.

17:55.325 --> 17:56.314
But what would...

17:56.409 --> 17:57.364
Do it!

17:59.287 --> 18:01.073
Transmitting.

18:01.164 --> 18:03.621
(growling angrily)

18:03.708 --> 18:05.118
A Luxan?!

18:05.210 --> 18:07.246
We're fighting a Luxan!

18:07.337 --> 18:09.202
Terminate plasma!

18:09.297 --> 18:11.754
Terminate plasma attack!

18:13.927 --> 18:16.009
Cut transmission.

18:17.555 --> 18:19.341
Pilot:
I don't believe it.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.593
They're powering down
their weapons.

18:21.685 --> 18:23.801
Congratulations, D'argo.

18:23.895 --> 18:26.602
You've just bought us
some time.

18:31.278 --> 18:32.393
Right.

18:32.487 --> 18:33.943
No lies.

18:34.030 --> 18:36.282
Does this ship have any weapons
aboard that are still active?

18:36.366 --> 18:38.231
Anything we can use
to fight back?

18:38.326 --> 18:42.945
No. Everything has been
dismantled or destroyed.

18:43.039 --> 18:45.155
What about this thing?

18:45.250 --> 18:46.990
The defense screen?
What will this do?

18:47.085 --> 18:48.200
What do you think?

18:48.295 --> 18:50.911
No, the question is will it
stop a Sheyang attack?

18:51.006 --> 18:54.214
Well, be that as it may,
we can't stall them
for eight arns.

18:54.676 --> 18:55.882
Four.

18:57.304 --> 18:59.465
Four... l'll, um, uh...

18:59.556 --> 19:01.387
I'll do half the work.

19:03.977 --> 19:05.217
What?

19:05.312 --> 19:07.348
Is there some kind of union
thing I don't know about?

19:07.439 --> 19:11.557
No. It's just this wiring
is very sophisticated.

19:11.651 --> 19:14.518
Yep. And I love opera.

19:15.572 --> 19:18.109
Beautiful!

19:18.199 --> 19:20.451
It's not my face they are
afraid of, D'argo.

19:20.535 --> 19:22.196
You must continue the ruse.

19:22.287 --> 19:25.245
I cannot lie to an
opponent in battle.

19:25.332 --> 19:27.448
It's not lying.

19:27.542 --> 19:29.703
Simply mislead them.

19:29.794 --> 19:33.878
For a priest you certainly have
a very flexible morality.

19:33.965 --> 19:36.251
Well, I apologize.

19:38.428 --> 19:42.421
It must be done, and you
must do it.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.551
I will assist you if we live.

19:44.642 --> 19:46.553
( frustrated grunt )

20:01.284 --> 20:04.071
Is something the matter?

20:07.791 --> 20:09.952
This isn't going to work.

20:10.043 --> 20:12.455
The main fusion panel
is charred.

20:13.922 --> 20:17.506
Gilina, you told Aeryn that
you could do this.

20:19.552 --> 20:22.544
I didn't want to be executed
for failing to try.

20:26.226 --> 20:30.595
Look, I told you,
we are not killers.

20:34.943 --> 20:37.685
You killed Captain
Crais' brother.

20:42.283 --> 20:44.490
That was an accident.

20:44.577 --> 20:48.195
Our ships collided. It could
have easily gone the other way.

20:51.084 --> 20:53.666
(Aeryn grunts and pants)

20:53.753 --> 20:56.130
Can I get you both some rations?

20:56.214 --> 20:59.377
Some chilled frotein, perhaps.

20:59.467 --> 21:01.924
We're out of five-line conduit,
Officer Sun.

21:03.221 --> 21:04.882
Those are the wrong kind.

21:04.973 --> 21:06.383
I've searched throughout
the ship.

21:06.474 --> 21:09.341
Have you tried medical
rejuvenation on the
seventh tier...

21:09.436 --> 21:10.846
I know where it is.

21:10.937 --> 21:12.973
That door's jammed.

21:24.200 --> 21:28.193
We possess the salvage rights
to that vessel you are
docked with.

21:28.288 --> 21:32.281
And yet you will not produce
the authority manifest to
confirm that.

21:32.375 --> 21:35.617
Must we distrust each other?

21:35.712 --> 21:42.174
Once my soldiers are back on
board, you may continue
your "salvage."

21:42.260 --> 21:44.342
End this charade, Teurac.

21:44.429 --> 21:46.044
He has no soldiers.

21:46.139 --> 21:48.676
He doesn't even have a crew.

21:48.766 --> 21:51.018
(dry chuckle)

21:51.102 --> 21:56.438
My young protege does not think
you can back up your claims.

21:56.524 --> 22:01.564
He thinks we can invade
and destroy you.

22:01.654 --> 22:06.193
Curious. l was just thinking
the same thing about you.

22:06.284 --> 22:09.868
Your quaint cockpit seems to
belie any military boasts.

22:09.954 --> 22:13.321
Your crummy cockpit seems to
belie any military boasts.

22:13.416 --> 22:16.533
Pray that you should
never know.

22:16.628 --> 22:21.338
And Ka D'argo, make no mistake,

22:21.424 --> 22:25.042
you are trying my patience.

22:25.136 --> 22:26.922
(groaning)

22:27.472 --> 22:28.962
Well done.

22:29.057 --> 22:31.924
Barely.
You must stop with this
incessant prompting.

22:32.018 --> 22:33.679
You asked for my help, D'argo.

22:33.770 --> 22:36.011
You foisted it upon me.

22:36.105 --> 22:38.357
But now that moment is passed.

22:39.442 --> 22:41.353
How much time do we have, Pilot?

22:41.444 --> 22:45.062
If we are to believe the
Peacekeeper tech,

22:45.156 --> 22:48.398
two more arns.

22:48.493 --> 22:51.735
Three conversations without
substance I believe is enough.

22:51.829 --> 22:54.161
The next one will spurn attack.

22:54.249 --> 22:57.537
And it's always
red wire or blue wire.
Red wire or blue wire.

22:57.627 --> 22:59.163
And at the last possible second,

22:59.254 --> 23:00.118
(clicks tongue)

23:00.213 --> 23:02.124
he cuts the wrong wire.

23:02.215 --> 23:03.455
And the bomb never goes off.

23:03.550 --> 23:06.007
No, he cuts the wrong wire.
That's not the point.

23:06.094 --> 23:09.803
15 seconds later, they're
running out of the building and
everything blows all to hell.

23:09.889 --> 23:10.969
(laughing)

23:11.057 --> 23:12.843
And you call this
entertainment?

23:12.934 --> 23:15.926
Yeah, well, you know, it
replaced cockfighting.

23:16.020 --> 23:18.352
Oh!
(groaning)

23:18.439 --> 23:20.395
Oh, my eye.

23:21.526 --> 23:23.312
Oh, let me see. Let me see.
Whoa, careful, careful.

23:23.403 --> 23:25.314
Let me see.

23:25.405 --> 23:26.690
Get it out...

23:26.781 --> 23:28.112
Hold still... shh, shh, shh.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.406
Oh, sorry.

23:30.493 --> 23:33.860
(both laughing)

23:34.330 --> 23:35.194
Um...

23:35.290 --> 23:36.951
Let me see.

23:38.376 --> 23:39.286
It's okay.

23:39.377 --> 23:41.242
Yeah? Yeah?

23:42.505 --> 23:47.966
You know what else happens
in these movies is that...

23:49.220 --> 23:52.508
the guy and the girl always
end up surviving...

23:52.599 --> 23:55.215
and liking each other.

23:56.311 --> 23:59.178
We have such fiction also.

24:01.399 --> 24:03.765
It's a small universe.

24:18.207 --> 24:20.619
(chirping and beeping)

24:26.007 --> 24:30.125
(gasping)

24:30.219 --> 24:32.301
(Rygel whimpering)

24:32.388 --> 24:35.255
Come now. We've just begun.

24:35.350 --> 24:38.387
(whimpering)

24:41.189 --> 24:43.225
(beeping and squeaking)

24:43.316 --> 24:46.399
Oh, there you are.
We've been looking all
over for you, Rygel.

24:46.486 --> 24:48.477
You're making the DRDs nervous.

24:48.571 --> 24:50.402
And we need your
negotiating talents.

24:50.490 --> 24:54.153
I think l was meant to die
here the first time.

24:54.243 --> 24:57.326
That's why the spirits have
brought me back to the
Zelbinion.

24:57.413 --> 24:58.823
ldon't think so.

24:58.915 --> 25:00.871
For one thing, the captain
of that ship is dead.

25:00.958 --> 25:02.539
Not to me.

25:02.627 --> 25:04.492
Then you must confront him.

25:04.587 --> 25:06.543
How?

25:06.631 --> 25:08.292
Find his corpse.

25:08.383 --> 25:10.214
It will set you free.

25:12.428 --> 25:15.761
l have never known a
full Luxan warrior

25:15.848 --> 25:19.136
to be on a ship without
defense and offense.

25:19.227 --> 25:25.223
My intention is not to lead us
into a hidden threat.

25:25.316 --> 25:27.352
(guttural hissing )

25:31.114 --> 25:33.730
What is your intention?

25:34.283 --> 25:36.069
(grunting)

25:50.925 --> 25:52.290
Evran!

25:52.385 --> 25:54.876
Ignite the plasma generators.

25:54.971 --> 25:58.304
Aim for the Leviathan.

25:58.391 --> 26:00.632
Destroy her.

26:00.727 --> 26:03.184
What do you mean, they're
firing? What did you
say to them?

26:03.271 --> 26:06.229
Nothing! They will not respond
to my signal.

26:09.068 --> 26:10.183
How close are we?

26:10.278 --> 26:13.145
Close. Disconnect all the black
wires. The black ones.

26:13.239 --> 26:14.854
Here.

26:16.784 --> 26:18.194
How much time, Pilot?

26:18.286 --> 26:20.322
Less than 50 microts.

26:23.040 --> 26:23.904
Officer Sun...

26:24.000 --> 26:24.830
Yes.

26:24.917 --> 26:26.418
Pass me up those connections.

26:26.502 --> 26:27.833
Yes.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.296
Come on, come on, come on...

26:29.380 --> 26:31.211
35...

26:32.383 --> 26:33.418
That's it.

26:34.802 --> 26:35.382
30...

26:35.470 --> 26:37.426
(growling)

26:39.599 --> 26:41.214
Full charge, Evran.

26:41.309 --> 26:42.549
No mistakes.

26:42.643 --> 26:43.473
20...

26:43.561 --> 26:45.347
-Click, click.
-Okay. Okay.

26:48.649 --> 26:49.980
Come on baby, baby, baby.

26:50.067 --> 26:51.056
Got it?

26:51.152 --> 26:52.107
Yes.

26:52.195 --> 26:52.934
Ten...

26:55.656 --> 26:57.783
One more, okay?

26:59.786 --> 27:00.400
Five...

27:00.495 --> 27:01.701
Hurry!

27:05.917 --> 27:07.202
Got it!

27:07.293 --> 27:08.248
Got it!

27:40.326 --> 27:41.941
The defense screens held.

27:42.036 --> 27:44.368
Moya's unharmed.

27:51.087 --> 27:52.577
(grunting)

27:55.007 --> 27:56.588
Evran!

27:57.802 --> 28:00.293
Our weapon had no effect.

28:00.388 --> 28:01.798
( frustrated growl )

28:01.889 --> 28:04.175
Recharge immediately!

28:04.267 --> 28:05.882
Hit them again!

28:05.977 --> 28:10.346
(yelling)

28:10.439 --> 28:12.691
Answer to me, Lomus.

28:24.412 --> 28:27.904
I am greatly disappointed
in you.

28:30.251 --> 28:32.867
Somehow, I expected the...

28:32.962 --> 28:33.826
(whimpering)

28:33.921 --> 28:37.163
Dominar of Hyneria to be more...

28:38.009 --> 28:39.920
dominating.

28:41.721 --> 28:44.633
(whimpering)

28:45.766 --> 28:47.347
(grunting)

28:49.812 --> 28:52.178
I regret to dampen
spirits, D'argo,

28:52.273 --> 28:53.763
but Pilot reports a problem.

28:53.858 --> 28:58.101
My scans show the defense screen
is not fully complete.

28:58.195 --> 29:01.779
There are gaps which
leave us vulnerable.

29:07.038 --> 29:10.872
The D.S. is two identical
systems overlaid on top
of one another.

29:10.958 --> 29:13.916
We only had time to
hook up one.

29:14.003 --> 29:15.914
W-w-wait a minute.

29:16.005 --> 29:18.337
( chuckling )
How crazy is this?

29:18.424 --> 29:19.925
Now, there's two systems, right?

29:20.009 --> 29:21.124
Yeah.

29:21.218 --> 29:23.300
So why don't be install
one of them on Moya?

29:27.558 --> 29:33.224
l have been sworn never to
compromise Peacekeeper
technology with the enemy.

29:44.992 --> 29:47.324
I will do it for you.

29:48.746 --> 29:50.156
For all of you.

29:53.209 --> 29:59.330
To displace an Overlord during
battle and then fail?

29:59.423 --> 30:02.210
It's not my fault.

30:02.301 --> 30:04.963
What about my father?
Your oath?

30:05.054 --> 30:07.170
Oh, frax your father!

30:07.264 --> 30:09.801
This is on you.

30:10.518 --> 30:12.804
Choose.

30:15.106 --> 30:21.727
I will lead my unit and
capture that ship with
no prisoners taken.

30:21.821 --> 30:28.238
Those gaps in the protective
barrier you must fly through
are small and shifting.

30:28.327 --> 30:30.909
Do you leave me a choice?

30:32.289 --> 30:35.031
(laughing)

30:35.126 --> 30:40.871
Perhaps one day they will sing
songs of your early death.

30:40.965 --> 30:43.422
(laughing)

30:45.011 --> 30:47.218
So, you like deep space
physics, too?

30:47.304 --> 30:49.260
Yeah.

30:49.348 --> 30:51.805
Do you know cosmic theory?

30:51.892 --> 30:54.634
Yeah. it's something that
intrigues me.

30:55.396 --> 30:56.385
(grunting)

30:56.480 --> 30:57.981
I got my doctorate in it.

30:58.065 --> 31:00.351
Uh, doctorate?

31:00.443 --> 31:01.853
What is that?

31:01.944 --> 31:05.152
It's a couple of letters they
add to the end of your name.

31:06.032 --> 31:07.693
Not much help out here, though.

31:07.783 --> 31:12.493
Last textbook | read made
a case for why you and

31:12.580 --> 31:15.413
all other forms of alien
life didn't exist.

31:17.960 --> 31:19.666
Can you, um...

31:19.754 --> 31:21.961
can you anchor this
while I pull?

31:23.507 --> 31:24.758
Yeah.

31:24.842 --> 31:26.628
Hold that.

31:26.719 --> 31:27.299
Got it?

31:27.386 --> 31:28.671
Yeah, go.

31:29.805 --> 31:31.341
(grunting)

31:38.814 --> 31:43.183
It seems human and
Sebacean men are...

31:44.278 --> 31:46.519
much the same.

31:46.614 --> 31:50.198
Yeah. I've not noticed
any differences in the
women, either.

32:05.716 --> 32:08.002
(chuckling)

32:37.623 --> 32:40.205
I've set up four of
the components...

32:41.210 --> 32:43.701
in the Maintenance Bay.

32:48.509 --> 32:51.091
(grunting)

32:51.178 --> 32:54.045
Sorry for interrupting!

32:56.225 --> 32:57.965
Hang on. Aeryn?

32:59.895 --> 33:01.010
Aeryn?

33:01.105 --> 33:03.938
Aeryn, would you wait?

33:04.024 --> 33:06.310
Look, what the heck's the
matter with you?

33:06.402 --> 33:08.643
I'm sure you could see how
heavy these things are.

33:08.737 --> 33:10.238
There's at least another
ten in there.

33:10.322 --> 33:13.314
Do not come down this
corridor without one.

33:14.785 --> 33:16.821
Would you stop?

33:17.580 --> 33:18.945
Hey!

33:19.039 --> 33:20.825
Look, hey, what happened
back there was...

33:20.916 --> 33:22.201
None of my business.

33:22.293 --> 33:23.703
Yes, it was.

33:23.794 --> 33:25.295
(grunting)

33:26.589 --> 33:29.171
You and l are shipmates.

33:29.258 --> 33:32.216
What I'm trying to say is...

33:32.303 --> 33:34.214
haven't you just clicked
with a guy?

33:34.305 --> 33:35.761
What? Clicked?

33:35.848 --> 33:36.883
Yeah, you know?

33:36.974 --> 33:39.010
Found a guy attractive.

33:39.101 --> 33:41.433
Yes, but I didn't let it...

33:41.520 --> 33:45.104
In the beginning, I found
you... interesting.

33:46.150 --> 33:47.310
Me.

33:47.401 --> 33:50.268
Yes, but only for a moment.

33:51.822 --> 33:53.733
Good. That's, uh...

33:53.824 --> 33:56.236
Good. l-l mean, it's good
to be on...

33:56.327 --> 33:58.192
even terms.

33:58.287 --> 33:59.823
I agree.

34:02.333 --> 34:04.244
Yeah, um...

34:04.335 --> 34:07.042
it's always a good idea
to clear the air.

34:12.051 --> 34:15.384
Very clear air!

34:39.370 --> 34:41.235
(gasping)

34:41.330 --> 34:43.116
Durka.

34:45.960 --> 34:49.123
Is it really you, Durka?

34:54.760 --> 34:56.842
You killed yourself, Durka.

34:56.929 --> 34:58.840
You coward.

35:08.440 --> 35:12.979
You once told me I would never
leave your ship alive.

35:13.070 --> 35:16.153
You robbed me of so many cycles.

35:16.240 --> 35:21.485
But no matter what you did
to me, I'll always remember
one thing.

35:22.538 --> 35:25.280
You lose!

35:25.374 --> 35:26.864
( snorting )

35:31.672 --> 35:35.005
l have full separation from
the main module.

35:35.092 --> 35:37.959
Launch the others.

35:42.641 --> 35:43.801
How many are there?

35:43.892 --> 35:45.928
Uh, at least a dozen.

35:46.020 --> 35:49.137
They're moving too fast
to track them all.

35:51.317 --> 35:53.603
Pilot, can they get aboard
the Zelbinion?

35:53.694 --> 35:55.400
Can they breach the
defense screen?

35:55.487 --> 35:57.102
When I kill the bypass,

35:57.197 --> 36:01.941
these two polaric discs will
be attracted to each other,
strongly,

36:02.036 --> 36:03.617
so you have to hold them apart.

36:03.704 --> 36:07.492
Because if they touch each
other, this whole room
will be vaporized.

36:11.086 --> 36:13.338
Lomus:
All right, scoundrel foragers.

36:13.422 --> 36:15.458
It's time to prove our glory.

36:15.549 --> 36:17.130
Have any of them made
it through?

36:17.217 --> 36:18.172
I can't tell yet.

36:18.260 --> 36:20.125
I'll have to do a
debris analysis.

36:20.220 --> 36:21.346
Quickly!

36:21.430 --> 36:25.343
Lomus:
Aim for the gaps in
the defense screen.

36:27.853 --> 36:30.139
I'll do it myself!

36:32.524 --> 36:33.855
(yelling)

36:33.942 --> 36:36.558
They're going to pull
incredibly hard.

36:36.653 --> 36:38.063
Okay.

36:38.447 --> 36:39.812
Ready?

36:39.907 --> 36:40.862
Now.

36:40.949 --> 36:42.325
Whoa!

36:44.161 --> 36:45.276
Aeryn, where are you?

36:45.371 --> 36:47.327
Maintenance Bay.
What's the problem?

36:47.414 --> 36:50.622
We think one of the Sheyangs
got on board the Zelbinion.

36:52.920 --> 36:54.251
How the hell did that happen?

36:54.338 --> 36:55.748
Zhaan:
Not important.

36:55.839 --> 36:58.125
What is, is he may be heading
right toward you.

37:03.347 --> 37:04.462
You've got to stop.

37:04.556 --> 37:06.342
Not once I've started
the process.

37:06.433 --> 37:08.594
Then finish the process.

37:10.562 --> 37:12.223
I'm working as fast as I can.

37:12.314 --> 37:13.178
I want you to get out of here.

37:13.273 --> 37:15.309
I won't leave you.

37:25.452 --> 37:28.285
On the ground, now!

37:29.581 --> 37:30.912
Do it!

37:41.385 --> 37:45.594
Gilina, I want you out of here.

37:47.307 --> 37:49.559
If you die here, John...

37:49.643 --> 37:51.224
I die, too.

38:00.529 --> 38:04.192
He keeps blocking my route,
forcing me to take the
long way around.

38:04.283 --> 38:06.194
You may have to defend
yourselves.

38:06.285 --> 38:09.072
Look, Aeryn, it's a long story
but I've kind of got my
hands full here,

38:09.163 --> 38:11.620
so you're going to
have to get here!

38:17.421 --> 38:20.709
(grunting)

38:20.799 --> 38:25.168
You'd better get here fast,
because Froggy's outside
the door right now.

38:26.763 --> 38:29.095
(grunting)

38:32.352 --> 38:34.217
Aeryn's going to get here.

38:34.313 --> 38:36.053
Come on, Aeryn. Come on.

38:36.148 --> 38:38.855
(roaring)

38:42.779 --> 38:44.315
Crichton:
They spit fire?

38:44.406 --> 38:46.146
How come nobody tells
me this stuff?

38:46.241 --> 38:47.856
How come nobody tells
me they spit fire?

38:47.951 --> 38:49.111
Aeryn?

38:53.207 --> 38:55.448
Come on, Aeryn, come on.

39:03.133 --> 39:04.748
Shit.

39:09.181 --> 39:10.717
Howdy, big guy.

39:10.807 --> 39:13.719
Look, um, as you can see,
it's not likely we're
going to hurt you,

39:13.810 --> 39:16.938
so take anything you want, but
if these two paddles touch...

39:25.030 --> 39:27.487
Listen, gas-whole!

39:27.574 --> 39:29.155
You kill us, you kill yourself.

39:29.243 --> 39:33.111
You had your chance to retreat.

39:33.205 --> 39:34.570
Come a little closer then.

39:34.665 --> 39:37.498
Let's just find out what
happens when these
paddles touch.

40:00.899 --> 40:03.311
Sorry about the mess.

40:12.369 --> 40:13.484
Absolutely not.

40:13.579 --> 40:15.991
Our situation is untenable
as it is.

40:16.081 --> 40:17.617
I'm with D'argo on this, John.

40:17.708 --> 40:21.200
Allowing Gilina to
encourage Crais' return
is suicidal at best.

40:21.295 --> 40:25.129
Look, the Sheyangs are sitting
out there waiting for another
chance to slip through,

40:25.215 --> 40:28.207
and Crais is going to
come back one day.

40:28.302 --> 40:29.508
What then?

40:29.595 --> 40:31.802
D'argo:
We have done well to
evade Crais as it is.

40:31.888 --> 40:34.345
With a start, he would
soon catch us.

40:34.433 --> 40:38.267
Crichton:
Not if she doesn't tell
him we were here.

40:38.353 --> 40:42.562
Zhaan:
I'm a trusting soul at best,
but not to a fault.

40:44.026 --> 40:46.688
The tech will not reveal
our presence.

40:46.778 --> 40:49.235
D'argo:
And how can you be so
sure about that?

40:49.323 --> 40:51.279
Aeryn:
You know what happened to me.

40:51.366 --> 40:55.075
Being deemed irreversibly
contaminated by Crais.

40:55.162 --> 40:58.245
Contamination by enemy
life-forms.

40:58.332 --> 41:01.039
That could happen to you.

41:01.752 --> 41:03.492
Punishment is death.

41:03.587 --> 41:05.248
Or worse,

41:05.339 --> 41:06.954
banishment.

41:08.675 --> 41:11.883
I hope you will only ever
imagine how horrible it is

41:11.970 --> 41:14.882
to never return to the
life that you love.

41:18.101 --> 41:21.434
You are smarter than
that, Gilina.

41:26.401 --> 41:29.734
They have sent a distress call
to the Peacekeeper Carrier

41:29.821 --> 41:32.028
that passed through
here earlier.

41:32.115 --> 41:35.528
It is returning at
maximum speed.

41:35.619 --> 41:38.110
Any word from Lomus?

41:38.205 --> 41:42.039
His life signal is
no longer active.

41:42.125 --> 41:43.581
( groans )

41:43.669 --> 41:47.457
What do you think we
should do, Evran?

41:47.547 --> 41:49.458
I'm sorry you are leaving.

41:49.549 --> 41:52.541
My officers are drawing up
plans to retaliate.

41:52.636 --> 41:55.002
ldoubtso.

41:55.097 --> 41:57.053
You had nothing,

41:57.140 --> 42:01.008
but you used it well.

42:01.103 --> 42:06.393
Evran, there is no shame in
losing to a clever opponent.

42:06.900 --> 42:09.391
And Ka D'argo...

42:11.029 --> 42:17.696
| make it a point to someday
kill my clever opponents.

42:17.786 --> 42:19.947
(sighs)

42:23.792 --> 42:25.874
You were magnificent, D'argo.

42:25.961 --> 42:28.794
With or without your
assistance?

42:28.880 --> 42:31.041
In spite of it.

42:33.468 --> 42:36.380
Crais will ask you many
questions.

42:38.181 --> 42:40.012
|Wi|| lie.

42:41.393 --> 42:43.805
| wish I had been so smart.

43:23.226 --> 43:25.433
You free this weekend?

43:29.149 --> 43:35.019
l have to overhaul a
Prowler engine, but
apart from that... yes.

43:40.243 --> 43:42.199
Gilina,

43:44.414 --> 43:46.154
I don't want you to go.

43:47.751 --> 43:49.912
Are you asking me to stay?

43:50.003 --> 43:54.292
No, I can't. I can't.
This is no way to live.

43:54.382 --> 44:00.048
And I can't ask you to come
back with me, because Crais
would kill you.

44:11.191 --> 44:13.273
So what do we do?

44:15.111 --> 44:17.602
You get any vacation time?

44:20.367 --> 44:23.359
I'm never going to see
you again, am I?

44:23.453 --> 44:25.569
Oh, yes. We'll find a way.

44:25.664 --> 44:29.327
We'll organize a rendezvous
point for later.

44:29.417 --> 44:31.078
Something, anything.

44:31.169 --> 44:32.830
Something.

44:34.297 --> 44:36.288
D'argo:
Crichton, there is no more time.

44:36.383 --> 44:37.873
We must go.

44:37.968 --> 44:40.004
In a minute, D'argo.

44:48.395 --> 44:51.432
Life sucks.

44:53.525 --> 44:56.312
It brought us together.

44:56.987 --> 44:59.273
Okay.

44:59.364 --> 45:02.151
It sucks a little less.

45:18.508 --> 45:20.169
D'argo:
Crichton?

45:20.552 --> 45:22.042
Crichton.

46:23.365 --> 46:24.775
Hey.

46:25.909 --> 46:28.446
A greeting I shall
never understand.

46:28.536 --> 46:29.992
Well, it's kind of all-purpose.

46:30.080 --> 46:32.742
Let's the other person decide
what they want to talk about.

46:32.832 --> 46:35.118
What if they don't
want to talk?

46:35.210 --> 46:37.326
Then they say "hey" back.

46:37.420 --> 46:39.081
Hey.

46:41.591 --> 46:44.128
Well, now, the first person
that doesn't want to talk

46:44.219 --> 46:49.213
can be trumped if the other
person realizes that
they need to.

46:49.307 --> 46:50.547
Hey.

46:59.985 --> 47:03.318
I hate being ambushed.

47:03.405 --> 47:06.397
Well, you got him in the end.
That's all that counts.

47:07.492 --> 47:10.484
lwasn't talking about
the Sheyangs.

47:13.915 --> 47:19.205
You know, on my world they say
that loss is the hardest
emotion to deal with.

47:19.295 --> 47:23.664
In my world, showing pain
is a sign of weakness.

47:23.758 --> 47:26.010
How can you not feel pain after
what you've been through?

47:26.094 --> 47:28.801
Don't presume to understand
me, John.

47:28.888 --> 47:32.346
Oh, that's not fair.

47:33.059 --> 47:34.640
That's not fair, Aeryn.

47:34.728 --> 47:36.844
You bash me all the time
for being soft.

47:36.938 --> 47:39.429
Well the fact of the matter
is that sometimes it's an
advantage and this is one of them.

47:39.524 --> 47:40.934
I think I understand
you perfectly.

47:41.026 --> 47:44.143
There's no way you can know
what I feel.

47:45.613 --> 47:51.199
If I somehow, someday get a
chance to return to my world,

47:51.286 --> 47:57.031
walk around my old neighborhood,
see my old house, Dad's truck,

47:57.125 --> 48:01.869
best friend's bike on the lawn,
and then I get a chance
to go inside.

48:03.256 --> 48:05.963
I walk through the living room,
upstairs to my room.

48:07.635 --> 48:10.502
I had a poster of
Clint Eastwood.

48:10.597 --> 48:12.963
The Good, The Bad
and The Ugly'.

48:15.935 --> 48:18.426
And then I think,

48:20.190 --> 48:24.308
what if everyone were dead?

48:24.402 --> 48:28.190
What if all my friends and
family were lying there...

48:28.281 --> 48:30.317
dead?

48:32.535 --> 48:35.652
Now, what would it be like
to go home then?

48:39.417 --> 48:42.124
I stand corrected.
