(mellow music playing)

01:04.166 --> 01:08.867
Dorothy, by any chance did you borrow
my pearl-handled six-shooter?

01:11.166 --> 01:15.266
-Blanche, you look ridiculous.
-I do not.

01:15.333 --> 01:19.367
I'm a cowgirl. Yippee-I-o-k-y.

01:21.834 --> 01:24.700
-Ki-yay.
-Well, whatever.

01:24.767 --> 01:26.834
-Where's my gun?
-No.

01:26.900 --> 01:30.734
Why wear this if
I've got nothing to put in it?

01:30.800 --> 01:33.700
I say the same thing
when I put on my bra.

01:37.033 --> 01:39.066
Why are you dressed like that?

01:39.133 --> 01:42.567
Because I'm going to an authentic
Texas-style barbecue,

01:42.633 --> 01:44.667
and my date is a real live cowboy.

01:45.200 --> 01:49.967
Morty Fishbein is a real live cowboy?

01:50.667 --> 01:52.934
He's from Amarillo, Texas.

01:53.300 --> 01:57.867
He was grand marshal of the B'nai B'rith
rodeo for three years straight.

01:59.333 --> 02:04.133
-Who better to go with to a barbecue?
-(telephone rings)

02:04.767 --> 02:06.767
Hello. Morty?

02:07.400 --> 02:10.033
Threw your back out putting your boots on?

02:11.900 --> 02:13.667
You're in traction?

02:14.500 --> 02:17.333
I guess this means
you'll be a little late.

02:19.100 --> 02:21.700
Oh, all right.

02:21.767 --> 02:25.767
Can you believe that?
Because of one little slipped disc,

02:25.834 --> 02:29.166
-Morty's not taking me to the barbecue.
-What a shame.

02:29.233 --> 02:32.600
You'll miss the foot-stomping version
of "Sunrise, Sunset."

02:34.467 --> 02:37.867
This kind of thing has been happening
a lot lately.

02:37.934 --> 02:41.266
I'm dating men who are too old.

02:41.333 --> 02:46.433
In the last year, my average date
has been over 60, bald,

02:46.500 --> 02:49.100
covered in liver spots, and wears a truss.

02:51.633 --> 02:52.967
Sounds good to me.

02:57.200 --> 03:02.333
I used to attract men who were young
and active and virile.

03:02.734 --> 03:06.166
But now they just want to date girls
in their 20s and 30s.

03:06.233 --> 03:08.834
What's a great-looking gal in her 40s
to do?

03:10.100 --> 03:12.700
Perhaps we should find one and ask her.

03:15.033 --> 03:19.233
Blanche, this is all your own fault.
Take Steven.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.233
You'd been dating him six weeks.

03:21.300 --> 03:25.066
When you looked like you were
committing yourself, you dumped him.

03:25.333 --> 03:28.066
-Six weeks is your limit.
-It isn't.

03:28.133 --> 03:32.166
It is, too. You were getting along great,
you liked each other,

03:32.233 --> 03:35.367
-you had a wonderful time.
-I won't discuss it.

03:35.433 --> 03:38.834
Besides, Steven didn't have
everything I look for.

03:40.800 --> 03:45.333
Hi, girls. What a great day.
I feel so terrific.

03:45.400 --> 03:49.834
It's like life is a giant weenie roast,
and I'm the biggest weenie.

03:55.333 --> 03:56.800
No argument from this corner.

03:59.033 --> 04:02.734
You're even more relentlessly cheerful
than usual.

04:02.800 --> 04:03.800
Thank you.

04:03.867 --> 04:06.367
It's because I've joined this group.

04:06.433 --> 04:11.500
They teach you to use positive thinking
to bring health, success, and love.

04:11.834 --> 04:15.266
-There's a meeting tonight. Want to come?
-Forget it.

04:15.333 --> 04:16.600
This is just a fad.

04:16.667 --> 04:20.166
It's for gullible people who believe
in magic.

04:20.233 --> 04:23.367
-You're not open-minded.
-I am so. Now shut up.

04:24.967 --> 04:29.166
That's exactly what I'm talking about.
Listen to yourself.

04:29.233 --> 04:32.233
-What are you afraid of?
-I'm not afraid of anything.

04:32.300 --> 04:36.333
Then come to the meeting.
Maybe it'll make your life better.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.934
All right.
If it will make you happy, I'll go.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.400
-Me, too.
-You won't regret it.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.233
Sophia?

04:45.300 --> 04:49.000
Today is the first day
of the rest of your life.

04:49.066 --> 04:51.500
Terrific. With luck, I'll live to be 7.

04:54.400 --> 05:01.433
(calm music playing)

05:14.934 --> 05:18.000
Oh, girls, you're just in time.
Where's Blanche?

05:18.066 --> 05:22.166
She said to save her a seat.
A man was smiling at her in the hall.

05:23.233 --> 05:24.900
Everybody's smiling here.

05:24.967 --> 05:28.800
I haven't seen so many goofy smiles
since the shady pines denture swap.

05:40.367 --> 05:44.367
Welcome to Create Your Own Miracles.
I'm Mary Ellen.

05:44.433 --> 05:47.500
Hi, Mary Ellen. You're special.

05:51.033 --> 05:54.400
You're special, too. Know why?
Because you're you.

05:54.467 --> 05:58.066
And there's nobody else like you.
Understand that?

05:58.133 --> 06:00.800
Only an idiot wouldn't understand that.

06:02.567 --> 06:06.166
Mary Ellen, I'm completely lost.
Could you run that by me again?

06:09.033 --> 06:12.600
After the lecture, Rose.
Just like last week.

06:13.867 --> 06:17.600
-Are there any newcomers tonight?
-Over here.

06:17.667 --> 06:21.467
-Rose, no.
-Please stand up and introduce yourself.

06:25.433 --> 06:28.333
-I'm Dorothy Zbornak.
-I'm Melanie Griffith.

06:32.967 --> 06:35.300
Hi, Dorothy. Hi, Melanie.

06:35.367 --> 06:37.367
(everybody) You're special.

06:39.033 --> 06:40.033
You're nuts.

06:43.033 --> 06:46.367
Actually, we're not newcomers.
We're just observing.

06:46.433 --> 06:50.467
-You're afraid of committing.
-She had no problem committing me.

06:52.700 --> 06:57.967
Joining a group, particularly a group
like this, just isn't my thing.

06:58.467 --> 07:03.533
I see. Your thing is sitting
on the sidelines playing the cynic,

07:03.600 --> 07:07.700
bursting a child's balloon
so he'll learn the harshness of life,

07:07.767 --> 07:11.867
pointing out what's wrong
rather than what's right.

07:11.934 --> 07:14.300
Where can we sign up for that group?

07:16.900 --> 07:20.200
Dorothy, you're a very negative person.

07:22.867 --> 07:26.800
People get these messages very early
in life, usually by their parents.

07:26.867 --> 07:28.867
In your case, my guess is the mother.

07:30.033 --> 07:31.700
Guess again, o special one.

07:34.867 --> 07:37.500
Is it my fault she got knocked up at 19?

07:41.567 --> 07:44.834
Look, to me, this is all a big show.

07:44.900 --> 07:51.233
I'm sure that under all these smiles,
you know life can be miserable sometimes.

07:51.300 --> 07:52.500
Come on, Melanie.

07:53.900 --> 07:58.400
I'm sorry you feel that way.
At least hear what we have to say.

07:59.533 --> 08:00.567
Fine.

08:02.567 --> 08:05.367
I think everybody really likes you,
Dorothy.

08:07.500 --> 08:10.467
(Mary Ellen explaining)

08:10.533 --> 08:11.867
I cannot believe this.

08:11.934 --> 08:17.333
I've got a guy like Steven crazy about me,
and I'm here with grinning idiots.

08:17.400 --> 08:20.734
-Let's go.
-We said we'd stay.

08:20.800 --> 08:25.633
A word of caution, don't doze off.
That's when the pods take over your body.

08:27.066 --> 08:32.200
(serene music playing)

08:33.367 --> 08:34.800
I hate to admit,

08:34.867 --> 08:38.133
but there may be something
to Rose's positive thinking.

08:38.533 --> 08:43.500
Last night I wrote
all my negative thoughts.

08:43.567 --> 08:47.000
I cannot believe how many there are.

08:47.066 --> 08:50.633
Listen, right here on page 187.

08:52.567 --> 08:56.734
"The faucet is dripping.
I know it's gonna keep me up all night.

08:56.800 --> 08:59.900
Then I'll be tired
for my crummy job tomorrow.

08:59.967 --> 09:03.667
Life is a swirling eddy of despair."

09:04.834 --> 09:11.266
I can't believe a leaky faucet
could bring all these bad thoughts.

09:11.700 --> 09:15.066
-That's serious.
-Ma, what can I do about it?

09:15.133 --> 09:16.600
Try changing the washer.

09:18.166 --> 09:20.533
I'm talking about negative thinking.

09:20.600 --> 09:24.266
I know. Remember what cousin Frederico
used to say?

09:24.600 --> 09:28.700
People waste their time pondering whether
a glass is half empty or half full.

09:28.967 --> 09:31.133
Me? I just drink whatever is in the glass.

09:32.266 --> 09:35.300
Ma, cousin Frederico
was a hopeless alcoholic

09:35.367 --> 09:39.834
who played bocce ball with an imaginary
friend named little Luigi.

09:41.600 --> 09:44.734
Kind of puts that dripping
faucet in perspective.

09:47.133 --> 09:48.900
-Oh, hi.
-Hey, Sophia.

09:48.967 --> 09:52.700
-Steven, nice to see you again.
-Nice to see you.

09:52.767 --> 09:56.567
May I get a drink?
I sweat off 10 pounds.

09:56.633 --> 09:58.033
Played lots of tennis?

09:58.800 --> 10:00.233
-Tennis, yeah.
-Yeah, right.

10:02.333 --> 10:05.166
Help yourself to whatever's in the fridge.

10:05.233 --> 10:07.967
It's nice you've worked things out.

10:08.033 --> 10:12.467
I think the problem before
was that he was on the rebound from Karen.

10:12.800 --> 10:15.734
Now he's all mine.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.800
And I think we appreciate each other more.

10:17.867 --> 10:21.700
Everything old and familiar
has become new and exciting.

10:22.333 --> 10:25.934
Maybe I should look up one of my old
flames.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.266
Yeah, but not Stan. The other one.

10:32.133 --> 10:37.500
(mellow music playing)

10:39.734 --> 10:43.934
-I have some incredible news.
-You've been traded to the rams.

10:46.233 --> 10:48.867
You know that nasty butcher down at the
deli?

10:48.934 --> 10:50.567
The little guy with four fingers?

10:53.600 --> 10:54.834
That's him.

10:55.166 --> 10:58.934
I don't know, but every time I order roast
beef, he cheats me.

10:59.000 --> 11:04.900
I watch him slice a big roast beef,
but when I get home,

11:04.967 --> 11:08.767
I find these crummy pieces from the end.

11:08.834 --> 11:11.800
Today I went in with a positive attitude.

11:11.867 --> 11:17.467
I told myself, "This man is my friend,
and he'll give me a good cut of meat."

11:18.400 --> 11:19.433
Look.

11:19.967 --> 11:21.567
It's a miracle!

11:22.367 --> 11:23.800
Oh, great.

11:23.867 --> 11:27.100
Pilgrims will show up
to kiss Dorothy's luncheon meat.

11:28.066 --> 11:30.000
It doesn't mean much to you,

11:30.066 --> 11:33.667
but I acted positively,
and things are improving.

11:33.734 --> 11:38.200
Now I feel I have the power
to make anything happen.

11:38.266 --> 11:41.100
-It is beautiful out there.
-Thank you.

11:44.166 --> 11:48.834
-Am I dressed ok for the dog races?
-That depends. Are you competing?

11:52.400 --> 11:56.333
Nothing you can say will bother me.

11:56.400 --> 12:01.100
Because when I'm with Steven,
I don't know, I get goose bumps.

12:01.166 --> 12:05.367
-I feel all tingly.
-I understand what you mean.

12:05.433 --> 12:10.333
I feel the same when I hear the words,
"Filling in for doc, Tommy Newsom."

12:11.100 --> 12:16.834
-(telephone rings)
-Oh, this is terrific, terrific!

12:16.900 --> 12:21.033
Blanche took a positive step,
and positive things are happening.

12:21.100 --> 12:23.633
Maybe it'll work for me.

12:23.700 --> 12:28.367
I'll get a man who is open, caring,
honest, who has eyes only for me.

12:28.433 --> 12:31.000
You got your roast beef. Don't push it.

12:34.633 --> 12:36.033
That was the hospital.

12:37.300 --> 12:38.934
Steven's had a heart attack.

12:43.767 --> 12:46.700
-I'll drive you to the hospital.
-No.

12:47.300 --> 12:52.100
-I'm not sure you should drive yourself.
-I'm not sure I'm going.

12:55.233 --> 13:00.133
-What do you mean?
-I have other things to do.

13:00.200 --> 13:04.600
If this happened
to someone I cared about, I'd go.

13:04.667 --> 13:08.767
-I care. I just have things to do.
-Like what?

13:08.834 --> 13:11.500
I'm keeping this relationship casual.

13:11.567 --> 13:15.433
If I go, I'm in, and there's no getting
out.

13:15.500 --> 13:19.967
All you have to do
is follow the orange line.

13:20.033 --> 13:22.066
It leads right to the elevators.

13:24.934 --> 13:31.400
It's not a good idea to hook up
with a 60-year-old man with a bad heart.

13:31.767 --> 13:34.900
What guarantee is there for the future?

13:34.967 --> 13:39.033
In life, there are no guarantees,
only choices.

13:39.100 --> 13:43.066
My choice is playing it safe
or taking a risk.

13:43.767 --> 13:45.400
I wish I knew what to do.

13:46.033 --> 13:49.066
All right. All right. I can pick up a cue.

13:49.133 --> 13:53.533
Picture it. Sicily, 1912.

13:54.367 --> 13:58.500
A beautiful young peasant girl
with clear, olive skin

13:58.567 --> 14:01.400
meets an exciting
but penniless Spanish artist.

14:01.967 --> 14:03.367
There's an instant attraction.

14:04.100 --> 14:06.000
They laugh, they sing...

14:06.467 --> 14:08.266
they slam down a few boilermakers.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.066
Shortly afterwards, he's arrested for
showing her how he can hold his palette

14:14.133 --> 14:15.900
without using his hands.

14:21.433 --> 14:23.033
But I digress.

14:23.433 --> 14:27.066
He paints her portrait,
and they make passionate love.

14:27.400 --> 14:30.834
She spends the next day
in the shower with a loofah sponge,

14:30.900 --> 14:33.066
scrubbing his fingerprints off her body.

14:34.633 --> 14:37.467
She sees the portrait and is insulted.

14:38.200 --> 14:42.367
It looks nothing like her.
She storms out of his life.

14:43.567 --> 14:45.433
That peasant girl was me.

14:46.934 --> 14:50.066
And that painter... was Pablo Picasso.

14:57.166 --> 14:59.133
I have a feeling you're lying.

14:59.200 --> 15:02.266
-Be positive.
-Ok, I'm positive you're lying.

15:03.233 --> 15:06.934
It doesn't make any difference.
I know what to do.

15:07.500 --> 15:10.266
I've got to put me first.

15:10.333 --> 15:13.066
Now there's a radical shift in priorities.

15:14.266 --> 15:18.400
I don't feel like making
this kind of emotional investment.

15:18.467 --> 15:23.000
-But, Blanche--
-I lost one man when George died.

15:23.333 --> 15:24.967
I won't do it again.

15:25.033 --> 15:30.467
(calm music playing)

15:35.700 --> 15:38.433
-Hi, Rose.
-How was your day?

15:38.500 --> 15:42.033
I tried being positive. It was lousy.

15:42.100 --> 15:45.934
In times like these,
you have to hold on to your faith.

15:46.433 --> 15:50.166
Just like Hans Glockenflanken,
St. Olaf's greatest explorer.

15:51.066 --> 15:56.133
Let me have some recovery time
before you start a St. Olaf story.

15:56.200 --> 16:01.333
You see, Hans Glockensplanken
set out for Florida

16:01.400 --> 16:03.900
to find the fountain of intelligence.

16:06.266 --> 16:09.567
Unfortunately he took
a left instead of a right

16:09.633 --> 16:11.467
and wound up back in St. Olaf.

16:11.533 --> 16:15.100
That's how he got his nickname,
"Wrong Way" Gerflickenflacken.

16:16.800 --> 16:19.400
Rose, how is this a story about faith?

16:19.467 --> 16:22.467
Well, when he got back
it was the dead of winter.

16:22.900 --> 16:26.433
Tired and hungry,
but still clinging to his belief

16:26.500 --> 16:29.300
that he would find
the fountain of intelligence.

16:29.600 --> 16:33.400
He saw the miracle water
trickling out of the ground.

16:33.900 --> 16:36.100
And he fell to his knees and tasted it.

16:36.734 --> 16:39.200
Unfortunately, it was a broken sewer main.

16:44.367 --> 16:46.533
Two days later, he died of cholera.

16:48.100 --> 16:50.100
What is the point?

16:50.166 --> 16:53.433
He was positive
he had found the fountain.

16:53.500 --> 16:58.300
In fact, his dying words were,
"I think I learned something."

17:02.133 --> 17:06.934
-Girls, am I interrupting?
-I sincerely hope so.

17:08.600 --> 17:11.934
-Don't you have a date?
-I canceled.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.033
He just wanted to go to Bimini
in his boat.

17:15.100 --> 17:16.967
That sounds like hell.

17:17.033 --> 17:21.133
I'm just not ready to start up something
with someone new.

17:21.633 --> 17:24.934
-It's because you miss Steven.
-Uh-huh. A lot.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.867
-Then why not visit him?
-When he got sick, it scared me.

17:28.934 --> 17:34.266
And you ran.
Blanche, it's time to stop running.

17:34.767 --> 17:37.300
-You really think so?
-Absolutely.

17:38.633 --> 17:41.233
You're right. I will.

17:41.834 --> 17:46.367
You always give me
the best advice about men.

17:47.500 --> 17:50.200
Who says wisdom comes from experience?

17:52.700 --> 17:57.767
(serene music playing)

18:07.934 --> 18:10.900
Oh, my God. What's happened?
Is he all right?

18:11.533 --> 18:12.700
He'll be ok.

18:13.266 --> 18:17.800
-I just hate seeing him like this.
-Oh. Are you a relative?

18:17.867 --> 18:19.133
I'm his wife.

18:22.533 --> 18:25.734
-His wife?
-He told me his wife died years ago.

18:26.734 --> 18:29.066
Oh! Oh, he did, did he?

18:32.200 --> 18:35.000
You louse. You crumb!

18:35.066 --> 18:39.600
This is who you're cheating with now,
a woman in her 60s!

18:42.266 --> 18:45.367
We're through.
You'll be hearing from my attorney.

18:46.934 --> 18:49.533
He's all yours. Enjoy.

18:54.400 --> 18:55.767
You're not Steven.

18:58.467 --> 19:02.633
-I'm over here, Blanche.
-Oh! Ha ha ha!

19:03.266 --> 19:04.567
Sorry about that.

19:10.033 --> 19:13.133
-Hi!
-Hi, Blanche. How are you?

19:13.200 --> 19:17.266
-Never mind me. How about you?
-Coming along.

19:17.333 --> 19:22.400
The doctor told me to keep my life dull.
No more excitement for a while.

19:22.700 --> 19:26.400
-Thanks for the flowers.
-It was the least I could do.

19:26.467 --> 19:27.600
I thought so, too.

19:28.500 --> 19:31.433
Oh, Steven, I'm sorry.

19:31.500 --> 19:35.867
There's no excuse for my not being here,
but the important thing is I'm back.

19:35.934 --> 19:38.066
-Blanche--
-Wait, honey. Let me finish.

19:38.133 --> 19:42.867
I know how much we care for each other,
how good we are for each other.

19:43.467 --> 19:49.300
Nobody has fun like we do.
Remember that night on the beach?

19:49.367 --> 19:52.467
-(heart monitor beeps)
-When I pretended my hand was a crab,

19:52.533 --> 19:54.100
crawling up your thigh?

19:56.500 --> 19:58.700
We wrapped ourselves up in that blanket,

19:58.767 --> 20:01.166
and you almost
jumped out of your skin

20:01.233 --> 20:03.533
when I showed you that savannah twister,

20:03.600 --> 20:06.100
-remember?
-(beeping speeds up)

20:07.600 --> 20:10.433
-Are you all right, Mr. Gordon?
-Yes, I'm fine.

20:10.900 --> 20:12.767
Sorry. It won't happen again.

20:14.533 --> 20:16.200
At least not until you're out of here.

20:17.500 --> 20:18.734
Blanche...

20:19.500 --> 20:21.633
Karen and I are back together.

20:22.333 --> 20:26.066
Karen?
You said it was all over between you.

20:26.133 --> 20:29.467
I thought it was,
but she came here as soon as she heard.

20:29.533 --> 20:34.667
You're going to let
one little gesture end our relationship?

20:34.734 --> 20:37.700
She was here when I needed
someone the most,

20:37.767 --> 20:41.133
and I realized how much we still
mean to each other.

20:42.533 --> 20:43.967
I'm very happy for you.

20:46.200 --> 20:49.100
No, I'm not. I'm mad at me.

20:50.066 --> 20:54.333
Ever since my husband died, I think
if I don't leave, I'm going to get left.

20:55.433 --> 20:57.633
Looks like either way I end up alone.

20:58.300 --> 21:01.967
-I'm sorry.
-Not half as sorry as I am.

21:02.934 --> 21:06.800
-Do I feel stupid.
-You shouldn't. You're a terrific lady.

21:10.133 --> 21:11.667
I'm going to miss you.

21:14.100 --> 21:16.900
-Don't you forget me, now.
-Don't worry.

21:17.734 --> 21:20.800
I'll always have this print-out
to remember you by.

21:22.600 --> 21:28.734
(mellow music playing)

21:30.500 --> 21:35.367
-You want me to drive tonight, Dorothy?
-I'm not going to the meeting tonight.

21:36.266 --> 21:40.633
-How come?
-I'm not comfortable with the people.

21:40.700 --> 21:45.033
-I'm not comfortable with the whole thing.
-But you need the group support.

21:45.100 --> 21:47.433
You shouldn't go it alone.

21:47.800 --> 21:50.467
Did I ever mention
my cousin Vigdov Frickin?

21:52.467 --> 21:57.600
He tried going it alone in a three-legged
race. You know what happened?

21:57.667 --> 22:01.200
Please, please, Rose! I don't want to hear
about your frickin cousin.

22:07.767 --> 22:11.033
Well, fine.
If you're not going, I'll stay home, too.

22:11.100 --> 22:14.767
-How come?
-I've seen you at those meetings.

22:14.834 --> 22:20.233
You tried to change, but you couldn't.
If I keep going, I'll drive you crazy.

22:20.300 --> 22:24.033
Don't stop doing something you believe in.

22:24.100 --> 22:26.500
I've gotten all I'm going to get
out of it.

22:26.767 --> 22:30.500
Besides, I'd rather be in this group
than that one.

22:31.233 --> 22:33.333
I hate to say this, but, Rose...

22:33.900 --> 22:35.066
you're special.

22:37.567 --> 22:38.967
Thank you.

22:39.667 --> 22:42.467
I could never get them to say that to me
at those meetings.

22:45.300 --> 22:50.066
-Oh... Blanche, is everything all right?
-Steven's back with his old girlfriend.

22:50.133 --> 22:51.200
Aw.

22:51.734 --> 22:53.800
-Are you ok?
-I'm fine.

22:53.867 --> 22:57.166
I learned a little bit
about missed opportunities

22:57.233 --> 22:59.533
and how sometimes
you have to take chances.

22:59.600 --> 23:02.767
But I met a new man in the next bed.

23:04.200 --> 23:06.467
He's recently broken up with his wife.

23:07.133 --> 23:12.533
-And he has the heart of a 25-year-old.
-Hey, that's great.

23:12.600 --> 23:15.300
Yeah. As long as his body doesn't reject
it.

23:23.333 --> 23:28.900
(theme music playing)
