00:05.606 --> 00:07.007
[Kaylie] Previously on
Make It Or Break It:

00:07.041 --> 00:08.642
I think I'm getting a cold,
but I'd hate

00:08.676 --> 00:10.144
to take something
that I'm not supposed to.

00:10.178 --> 00:13.013
[Annie] Pseudoephedrine would be
automatic elimination.

00:13.047 --> 00:15.616
[Payson] Is it true? Do you
consider me a lead-off position?

00:15.649 --> 00:19.053
I'm better than the gymnast
that just goes out there
and sets the bar to surpass.

00:19.087 --> 00:21.089
This is a wireless
reading device.

00:21.122 --> 00:23.624
- Five spikes in a row gets her
into risky territory.
- [beeping]

00:23.657 --> 00:24.758
Everyone, meet Otis.

00:24.792 --> 00:26.160
Every year a team steals him.

00:26.194 --> 00:27.628
Whoever has him
at the end of camp,

00:27.661 --> 00:29.097
always medals at the Olympics.

00:29.130 --> 00:31.699
Thanks to you,
I've lost everything.

00:31.732 --> 00:34.135
I have no interest
in being Mr. Kaylie Cruz.

00:34.168 --> 00:37.138
NGO's been kind enough
to send us Coach Ray Keegan.

00:37.171 --> 00:39.707
[Kaylie] No, that's
Coach Ray's car!

00:39.740 --> 00:43.043
[crying] He molested me.
For years, he molested me.

00:45.146 --> 00:47.148
[Payson] Kaylie, slow down!
Think about what you're doing.

00:47.181 --> 00:48.782
Is this even
your decision to make?

00:48.816 --> 00:51.152
You think I want to do this?
I don't!

00:51.185 --> 00:55.089
But if Jordan won't tell
then... I don't have a choice.

00:55.123 --> 00:58.025
You're accusing him
of committing a crime.
A sex crime!

00:58.058 --> 01:00.761
Think about what happened to
Sasha whethat he kissed me.

01:00.794 --> 01:04.031
His career was practically
ruined. And he was innocent!

01:04.064 --> 01:05.699
Maybe she's lying
or confused.

01:05.733 --> 01:06.700
What proof do you have that...

01:06.734 --> 01:08.035
She wasn't confused!

01:08.068 --> 01:10.104
You weren't there, Payson.
You didn't see her.

01:10.138 --> 01:14.041
This isn't some story
she's making up because
she wants attention.

01:14.074 --> 01:18.045
Keegan molested her.
And he did it for years.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.213
Then why won't she tell anyone?

01:20.848 --> 01:24.118
Maybe she's scared
or embarrassed. I don't know.

01:24.152 --> 01:27.788
But I won't let him
do this to anybody else.

01:27.821 --> 01:31.659
I couldn't live with myself.
It has to end now.

01:31.692 --> 01:35.129
You're right. It ends now.

01:36.830 --> 01:38.866
It's a very serious charge,
you realize that, don't you?

01:40.234 --> 01:43.837
Will Jordan confirm it?
'Cause that's very important.

01:43.871 --> 01:47.775
She'll have to tell the police
exactly what Coach Keegan
did to her. Otherwise...

01:47.808 --> 01:49.743
Well, she didn't want to talk
about it this morning,

01:49.777 --> 01:53.747
but now that you know...

01:53.781 --> 01:55.216
Yeah, she'll confirm it.

01:55.249 --> 01:59.086
You did the right thing
telling me, both of you.

01:59.119 --> 02:03.791
He'll never hurt anyone again,
I promise you that.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.711
What'cha making?

02:23.744 --> 02:24.912
A smoothie.

02:27.215 --> 02:29.783
Um... It's Kaylie's favorite.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.151
Well, aren't you just too sweet.

02:32.753 --> 02:35.122
[sighs]
Is she in her room?

02:35.155 --> 02:37.891
Um, everyone already left early.

02:37.925 --> 02:39.260
But I know
she's coming back.

02:39.293 --> 02:40.828
She left her gym bag.

02:40.861 --> 02:43.264
- Oh that's good.
- Uh, no!

02:43.297 --> 02:46.166
I only made enough
for Kaylie.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.268
Hey.

02:47.301 --> 02:48.836
Here, Kaylie,
I made this for you!

02:48.869 --> 02:50.238
Thanks.

02:51.305 --> 02:54.208
- Yum. Is Jordan here?
- Uh, no.

02:54.242 --> 02:58.246
She left after you.
Why, is something going on?

02:58.279 --> 03:00.748
- What is it?
- Nothing.

03:00.781 --> 03:01.949
Lo, we need to talk.

03:09.290 --> 03:10.824
[door closes]

03:10.858 --> 03:13.193
[McIntire] There's a
very strict protocol

03:13.227 --> 03:14.895
we have to follow here,
Jordan.

03:14.928 --> 03:17.231
I've already spoken
with the police.

03:17.265 --> 03:19.300
They're just gonna need you
to answer a few questions

03:19.333 --> 03:21.168
before they can file
formal charges.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.903
You won't even have to
see Coach Ray.

03:22.936 --> 03:25.306
I'll be with you.
This is not something

03:25.339 --> 03:26.907
you'll have to face alone.

03:26.940 --> 03:29.176
And I know Kaylie
feels the same way.

03:29.209 --> 03:32.212
Kaylie told you
that Coach Ray molested me?

03:32.246 --> 03:34.248
She was concerned for you.
So am I.

03:34.282 --> 03:36.250
No, the only thing that Kaylie
Cruz is concerned about

03:36.284 --> 03:37.851
is me beating
her at Trials.

03:37.885 --> 03:41.255
What she said?
It never happened.

03:41.289 --> 03:43.291
I have training to do.

03:52.266 --> 03:54.402
[crowd cheering]

04:00.908 --> 04:02.876
[Kaylie] She lied to you.
You know that.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.278
[McIntire]
No, I don't know that.

04:04.312 --> 04:06.280
Not for a fact.
And neither do you.

04:06.314 --> 04:07.915
Why would she tell me
Coach Ray did

04:07.948 --> 04:10.851
all those horrible things
if they weren't true?

04:10.884 --> 04:12.353
She has a history
of self-destructing.

04:12.386 --> 04:13.987
Maybe this is
just another version.

04:14.021 --> 04:15.356
Her reaction to pressure.

04:15.389 --> 04:18.826
That's bull. It's her reaction
to Ray Keegan.

04:18.859 --> 04:21.895
Maybe he's the reason why
she's had a "history of
self-destructing."

04:21.929 --> 04:26.233
You'd understand if you saw
the way that she trashed his car
last night.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.267
She what?!

04:29.870 --> 04:31.839
Kaylie, I think it'd be best

04:31.872 --> 04:33.341
if you stayed out
of this right now.

04:33.374 --> 04:36.910
Let me handle it. Olympic
Trials are in just two days.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.412
You should focus on that.

04:39.413 --> 04:40.948
[scoffs]

04:47.355 --> 04:49.423
[grunting, groaning]

04:49.457 --> 04:50.458
Damn!

04:54.895 --> 04:56.397
- We need to talk.
- No.

04:56.430 --> 04:57.965
The only thing
I need to do right now

04:57.998 --> 04:59.367
is stick my triple back.

04:59.400 --> 05:02.269
'Cause without it,
I'm not going to London.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.338
Look, Jordan,
I know that it's not easy,

05:04.372 --> 05:05.939
but you have to tell
Coach McIntire...

05:05.973 --> 05:07.375
Get this through your head.

05:07.408 --> 05:09.042
I'm done talking.

05:09.076 --> 05:11.044
To you. To Coach.
To everyone.

05:11.078 --> 05:13.447
Talking doesn't solve anything.

05:13.481 --> 05:16.016
It's something.
It's a start.

05:16.049 --> 05:18.051
Is it?

05:18.085 --> 05:20.888
You think I didn't try
to tell people about Keegan?

05:20.921 --> 05:22.956
I told my foster parents
after that summer at camp

05:22.990 --> 05:24.992
and you know what they did?
Nothing.

05:25.025 --> 05:28.061
They said that I was lucky
to have someone like Coach Ray

05:28.095 --> 05:30.398
working with me and that
I shouldn't screw it up.

05:30.431 --> 05:32.433
How about your other foster
families, like the one
in Balti...?

05:32.466 --> 05:35.903
I kept my mouth shut.
No one's gonna believe me.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.471
It's always gonna be
my word against Keegan's.

05:37.505 --> 05:40.107
So just let it go, Kaylie.
Let it go.

05:42.376 --> 05:44.344
[rapid beeping]

05:44.378 --> 05:47.080
[steady beeping]

05:47.114 --> 05:48.416
[exhales]

05:50.518 --> 05:53.320
[rapid beeping]
OK, easy. Easy.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.088
Single turn now,
let's not push it.

06:00.494 --> 06:02.095
[exhales]

06:02.129 --> 06:04.064
How's she doing?

06:04.097 --> 06:06.400
Dr. Walker is right.
She's healing.

06:06.434 --> 06:08.936
She's only spiked twice
into the danger zone

06:08.969 --> 06:11.405
And she's safe
until she spikes five times.

06:11.439 --> 06:13.974
- It's a simplified routine.
- Yeah.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.349
- [rapid beeping]
- OK. Let's stop there.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.517
Save the dismount.

06:23.551 --> 06:26.053
Like I could even do a dismount
if I wanted to.

06:31.391 --> 06:34.027
You look so cute
on the little beam.

06:34.061 --> 06:37.397
You remind me of myself
when I was five.

06:37.431 --> 06:39.433
Wendy. Urine sample.

06:39.467 --> 06:41.368
We'll be doing drug tests
all through Trials.

06:41.401 --> 06:44.037
Ah, no worries. I'm very careful
about staying away

06:44.071 --> 06:45.539
from everything on
that list you gave me.

06:45.573 --> 06:47.975
So, when can I get back on
the regulation beam,

06:48.008 --> 06:49.142
practice my full routine?

06:49.176 --> 06:51.111
That's up to Dr. Walker.

06:51.144 --> 06:53.547
We'll send him a copy
of your graph.

06:53.581 --> 06:56.450
Wendy! Do what you were told.

06:56.484 --> 06:59.019
Get that sample for Annie now.

07:04.057 --> 07:06.126
Hey Max, sorry I'm late.

07:06.159 --> 07:08.395
My car got vandalized
last night.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.163
Been dealing with
the insurance company.

07:13.567 --> 07:16.604
Outside. We need to talk.

07:24.044 --> 07:26.446
You need to leave. Now.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.181
I don't want you
around the girls.

07:28.215 --> 07:29.483
Why?

07:29.517 --> 07:31.418
I got a report

07:31.451 --> 07:33.153
that you acted improperly
with one of them.

07:33.186 --> 07:37.024
Improperly? What does
that mean, exactly?

07:37.057 --> 07:39.493
Don't play dumb with me,
you know exactly what it means.

07:39.527 --> 07:41.128
And you honestly believe that?

07:43.130 --> 07:45.465
Then where are the police
to arrest me?

07:45.499 --> 07:49.469
The girl that's involved isn't
ready to go to the police. Yet.

07:49.503 --> 07:52.606
But make no mistake, you're
this is done. a lawyer before

07:52.640 --> 07:55.042
Come on, Mac.

07:55.075 --> 07:56.577
I've been coaching girls
for 25 years.

07:56.610 --> 07:59.479
I've been through the same
background checks as you have.

07:59.513 --> 08:02.583
Don't you think if I had
ever acted "improperly,"

08:02.616 --> 08:05.085
that would have
come out by now?

08:05.118 --> 08:07.588
This is not a girl who lies,
Ray.

08:07.621 --> 08:10.558
This is a girl who,
if anything, is too honest.

08:10.591 --> 08:14.061
Everyone lies, Mac.
destroy a man's career.

08:14.094 --> 08:16.196
Don't let some screwed-up kid

08:16.229 --> 08:18.532
destroy what we're
trying to do here.

08:18.566 --> 08:21.101
Why haven't you asked me
who the girl is, Ray?

08:23.103 --> 08:27.107
Don't you care?
Or do you already know?

08:27.140 --> 08:30.544
I didn't ask because it doesn't
really matter who, does it?

08:30.578 --> 08:34.214
So stop playing judge and
jury and let me do my job.

08:34.247 --> 08:38.652
Trials are two days away
and thosAnd you need me.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.156
I told you to leave.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.658
I'm not going anywhere.

08:44.692 --> 08:49.563
The NGO hired me.
I don't work for you.

08:52.165 --> 08:53.200
[grunts]

08:58.606 --> 09:00.608
Who needs a lawyer now?

09:10.050 --> 09:11.885
[woman] Did you have to hit him?

09:11.919 --> 09:14.922
[McIntire] No. But don't expect
me to apologize, either.

09:14.955 --> 09:18.692
Do you know how special
the coach/athlete bond is?

09:18.726 --> 09:19.960
That he would exploit that to...

09:19.993 --> 09:21.829
Look, Mac,
I'm as frustrated as you are,

09:21.862 --> 09:24.798
but Kaylie's word just
isn't enough. Thank you.

09:24.832 --> 09:27.701
I've spoken to
our legal team and Keegan

09:27.735 --> 09:29.036
is entitled to the
presumption of innocence.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.972
If Jordan won't speak up,
there's nothing we can do.

09:32.005 --> 09:34.007
Not without exposing
the NGO to liability.

09:34.041 --> 09:35.843
I'm telling you right now,

09:35.876 --> 09:38.846
that son-of-a-bitch Keegan
sets foot in that gym,

09:38.879 --> 09:40.848
I'll hit him again.

09:44.785 --> 09:45.919
[Payson] I don't understand.

09:45.953 --> 09:47.788
If Jordan doesn't want to say
anything to the police,

09:47.821 --> 09:49.990
why did she bother beating the
hell out of Keegan's car?

09:50.023 --> 09:52.793
A warning, maybe?
I don't know.

09:52.826 --> 09:55.863
But I think she was worried
he was going after Wendy.

09:55.896 --> 09:58.065
If that's true,
then there must be other girls.

09:58.098 --> 10:02.736
Even if Jordan was his first,
there's no way thathe last.

10:02.770 --> 10:04.872
We just need to find
somebe willing to talk.

10:04.905 --> 10:06.840
[scoffs] How do
we do that?

10:08.842 --> 10:10.110
- Social media.
- What?

10:12.012 --> 10:14.114
OK. Between you and me,

10:14.147 --> 10:16.083
we have to know
at least 20 or 30 girls

10:16.116 --> 10:18.118
- that have been to one
of Ray - Yeah.s camps.

10:18.151 --> 10:19.987
And each of them
will know even more.

10:20.020 --> 10:23.023
That's great. And we only
need to find one other girl

10:23.056 --> 10:25.859
- to show Jordan
that s- Exactly.lone.

10:25.893 --> 10:28.896
Let's set up an alert
so that we don't miss it
if someone answers.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.832
[computer chimes]

10:31.865 --> 10:35.102
- How's that?
- I like it.

10:35.135 --> 10:38.071
It's the sound of Ray Keegan
going to jail.

10:41.041 --> 10:44.077
I'm here. What is so important,
it couldn't wait?

10:45.879 --> 10:48.048
[chuckles] You've gotta
be kidding me. Flowers?

10:48.081 --> 10:51.785
Yeah. I saw on TV that you
handed flowersways getting

10:51.819 --> 10:53.020
when you're up on
the medal stand.

10:53.053 --> 10:55.055
Thought I'd hit you
a day early. For luck.

10:55.088 --> 11:00.160
It looks like you walked on
them and then diin paint.

11:00.193 --> 11:02.863
It looks like you've
been dipped in paint.

11:02.896 --> 11:03.997
Where did you get these?

11:04.031 --> 11:05.999
I'm working on a little
art project. Never mind.

11:06.033 --> 11:07.868
You don't want the damn flowers,
just say so.

11:07.901 --> 11:09.036
No. It's just that if you were

11:09.069 --> 11:10.971
gonna give me something
for luck...

11:11.004 --> 11:12.840
...I'd rather have the Otis.

11:12.873 --> 11:13.941
You can just forget about Otis.

11:13.974 --> 11:16.143
Otis is deep, deep,
deep undercover.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.812
So what's the real reason
you wanted to see me?

11:18.846 --> 11:21.081
[chuckles] The flowers
aren't enough?

11:21.114 --> 11:23.884
OK, I got some news
from my coach today.

11:23.917 --> 11:25.853
And it's so good that
it needs to be shared

11:25.886 --> 11:27.154
and for some reason,
don't ask me

11:27.187 --> 11:29.056
'cause I can't explain it
myself,

11:29.089 --> 11:30.891
the first person
I thought of was you.

11:30.924 --> 11:33.060
Hmm. What's the news?

11:33.093 --> 11:34.828
Promise me you
won't get too excited.

11:34.862 --> 11:36.029
I'm not sure your weakened,

11:36.063 --> 11:37.931
cold, cold, heart can handle it.

11:37.965 --> 11:40.133
- I promise.
- I made the team.

11:40.167 --> 11:42.135
I'm going to London.
I'm going to the Olympics!

11:42.169 --> 11:44.972
Yeah! [laughing]

11:45.005 --> 11:48.942
Now, I know you want to give me
a kiss or hug me or something,

11:48.976 --> 11:50.043
and you're the shy type.

11:50.077 --> 11:52.880
And that's OK.
You have my permission.

11:53.947 --> 11:55.916
[sighs]

11:55.949 --> 11:57.084
I'm sorry.

11:57.117 --> 11:59.019
Only gold medal
winners get kisses.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.120
[slow gasp]

12:00.153 --> 12:02.022
If I win gold medal

12:02.055 --> 12:03.123
you're gonna
have to get in line.

12:03.156 --> 12:05.025
But you've got a deal.

12:10.964 --> 12:12.966
[Latin dance music]

12:21.108 --> 12:24.144
Are you absolutely sure
this is the best way
to get ready for Trials?

12:24.177 --> 12:26.246
Well, when Sasha took me to
ballet to help with my routine,

12:26.279 --> 12:29.149
it really worked and so I'm
hoping this'll work too.

12:29.182 --> 12:30.951
Oh, I'm not complaining.

12:30.984 --> 12:32.953
Wish my homework
involved going to a club.

12:32.986 --> 12:35.989
[Payson laughs] I just
think my choreography
needs a little kick.

12:36.023 --> 12:38.191
Hopefully, some authentic Latin
flavor will do the trick.

12:38.225 --> 12:40.961
And here I thought you just
wanted to dance with me.

12:40.994 --> 12:43.130
Mister, that ain't the half
of what I want to do with you.

12:52.072 --> 12:54.174
Oh, wow.

12:54.207 --> 12:57.244
What was I thinking?
There's no way I can do this.

12:57.277 --> 13:00.213
Yes, you can.
My bright light can shine

13:00.247 --> 13:04.151
in whatever she chooses to do.
Just let yourself go.

13:31.979 --> 13:33.981
- Woo.
- Oh, too hot to handle?

14:15.088 --> 14:17.090
[computer chimes]

14:23.363 --> 14:25.232
[computer chimes]

14:34.074 --> 14:35.375
[computer chimes]

14:38.245 --> 14:40.047
[computer chimes]

14:42.415 --> 14:44.084
[sighs]

14:45.318 --> 14:47.254
Jordan wasn't the only one.

14:48.255 --> 14:49.322
[computer chimes]

14:52.425 --> 14:54.394
What's going on?

14:59.332 --> 15:02.069
We put the word out
to other girls Keegan coached.

15:02.102 --> 15:04.171
We just couldn't believe
you were alone in this.

15:04.204 --> 15:07.040
- No, you had no right...
- Jordan, please.

15:07.074 --> 15:10.110
Look. You weren't the only one.

15:10.143 --> 15:12.379
There were other girls.

15:12.412 --> 15:16.116
You aren't alone. And it
looks like they're ready
to come forward.

15:16.149 --> 15:18.118
[chiming]

15:19.152 --> 15:20.387
It wasn't your fault.

15:22.122 --> 15:23.290
It wasn't.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.354
[muted]

16:07.234 --> 16:08.268
It's over.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.438
[Jordan] No. But it's something.

16:13.173 --> 16:15.375
Coach Mac knows this counselor,

16:15.408 --> 16:18.145
so I'm gonna talk to her.

16:18.178 --> 16:21.248
- That's good.
- Mm-hm.

16:21.281 --> 16:23.250
- [car door closes]
- [engine starts]

16:23.283 --> 16:26.353
- Yeah, I've seen enough.
- [siren wails]

16:30.290 --> 16:33.193
[classical music]

16:40.433 --> 16:43.336
So, what you do you think?

16:43.370 --> 16:45.205
I loved it!

16:45.238 --> 16:47.274
OK, be more specific?

16:47.307 --> 16:50.110
Well, I thought the flippy part
was very cool.

16:50.143 --> 16:53.313
And uh... the double Iranian?

16:56.249 --> 16:59.352
I love you,
but you're useless.

16:59.386 --> 17:02.455
[Sasha] You're not getting the
proper set for the height you
need to land the double Arabian.

17:02.489 --> 17:04.357
You're falling out of
the switch side,

17:04.391 --> 17:06.093
the dance moves
need more flow

17:06.126 --> 17:08.228
and there's no kissing
during practice.

17:08.261 --> 17:11.364
- Shall I continue?
- Sasha, what are you
doing here?

17:11.398 --> 17:14.301
Your friend Rigo gave me a call,
told me what was going on.

17:14.334 --> 17:17.204
You're taking a big risk
defying Coach McIntire.

17:17.237 --> 17:20.273
He's wrong about me.
I'm no sacrificial lamb.

17:20.307 --> 17:23.243
I know, Payson,
but he's the Olympic coach.

17:23.276 --> 17:26.213
And if you go against his
wishes, he could keep
you off the team entirely.

17:26.246 --> 17:30.250
I didn't fight all of these
years just for a trip to London.

17:30.283 --> 17:31.484
Isn't a gold medal
worth the risk?

17:31.518 --> 17:34.321
Well, this may sound selfish,

17:34.354 --> 17:38.125
but I would like
my gold medal back.

17:38.158 --> 17:39.459
And that will likely only happen
when you win one of your own.

17:39.492 --> 17:41.361
So, let's get busy, shall we?

17:41.394 --> 17:44.431
Romeo. Beat it.
We have work to do.

17:46.466 --> 17:47.467
Come on then.

17:53.306 --> 17:54.507
[man] Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Cruz,

17:54.541 --> 17:57.144
thank you for
driving down so early.

17:57.177 --> 17:59.512
I didn't want Coach McIntire
to say anything

17:59.546 --> 18:01.414
until we were all together.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.416
We're here now. What is it?

18:03.450 --> 18:05.385
We received the results
of Kaylie's

18:05.418 --> 18:08.221
most recent drug test
late yesterday.

18:08.255 --> 18:10.290
I'm afraid she's tested positive

18:10.323 --> 18:13.193
for a banned substance,
pseudoephedrine.

18:13.226 --> 18:15.228
It's often found
in cold medications,

18:15.262 --> 18:18.298
but it also can be used
as a performance aid.

18:18.331 --> 18:20.533
But, that's crazy,
I didn't take anything.
I never even had a cold.

18:20.567 --> 18:24.271
Clearly there's been
some sort of mistake made here.
How do we fix it?

18:24.304 --> 18:27.340
I'm sorry, there's no mistake.

18:27.374 --> 18:28.541
Are you saying that Kaylie
is lying?

18:28.575 --> 18:31.444
Because my daughter, I can tell
you, she doesn't lie.

18:31.478 --> 18:34.514
Mrs. Cruz, are you aware
that pseudoephedrine

18:34.547 --> 18:37.384
can also be used as
an appetite suppressant?

18:37.417 --> 18:40.453
Why don't we talk about
what's really going on here? Hm?

18:40.487 --> 18:42.255
You have an agenda.

18:42.289 --> 18:43.523
You haven't wanted Kaylie
to compete

18:43.556 --> 18:45.558
ever since she went against
the wishes of the NGO

18:45.592 --> 18:48.328
and confessed to the public
that she had an eating disorder.

18:48.361 --> 18:49.396
That is not true!

18:49.429 --> 18:52.265
OK, let's calm down.

18:52.299 --> 18:55.535
[exhales] Look, when I
played pro ball

18:55.568 --> 18:59.239
I'd hear a lot about false
positives with these tests.

18:59.272 --> 19:01.541
Why don't we at least give
Kaylie a blood test.

19:01.574 --> 19:03.576
I think we'll get
a more accurate result.

19:03.610 --> 19:09.316
- That seems reasonable, Marcus.
- NGO protocol doesn't allow
for extra tests.

19:09.349 --> 19:10.417
I'm sorry.
Those are the rules.

19:10.450 --> 19:12.285
Then change the rules!

19:12.319 --> 19:13.486
I can't.

19:20.593 --> 19:22.462
So, what does this mean?

19:24.597 --> 19:27.367
It means you can't compete
in Trials today, Kaylie.

19:29.402 --> 19:31.571
It means you can't go
to the Olympics.

19:36.576 --> 19:37.577
No.

19:39.346 --> 19:40.280
No.

19:49.556 --> 19:52.625
A lot's happened
in the past 24 hours.

19:52.659 --> 19:55.395
Ray Keegan was arrested,

19:55.428 --> 19:58.531
Kaylie Cruz has been
disqualified.

19:58.565 --> 20:01.568
I'm sure you've heard it all
and I'm sure you have questions.

20:01.601 --> 20:05.572
Well, now's not the time.

20:05.605 --> 20:07.740
Now is the time
to focus on Trials,

20:07.774 --> 20:10.443
the most important competition
you'll participate in

20:10.477 --> 20:11.711
outside of the Olympics.

20:11.744 --> 20:14.647
Now, the gym will be open for
a light workout this morning

20:14.681 --> 20:16.416
if that's what you choose to do.

20:16.449 --> 20:17.750
But my advice?

20:17.784 --> 20:19.486
Your bodies are ready.

20:19.519 --> 20:22.689
Take some time
to prepare your minds.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.457
That's all.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.729
How's Kaylie? I've left her
a million messages.

20:29.762 --> 20:31.531
She's devastated.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.433
I had to stop her
from packing.

20:33.466 --> 20:35.468
And her dad is threatening
to sue the NGO

20:35.502 --> 20:38.505
if they don't allow her to
take a blood test and compete.

20:38.538 --> 20:39.706
Sucks about Kaylie, huh?

20:39.739 --> 20:42.675
In a weird way, I blame myself.

20:42.709 --> 20:46.679
I knew she was getting too thin
and didn't say anything.

20:46.713 --> 20:51.518
It's true. That's why I made all
those fruit smoothies for her.

20:51.551 --> 20:54.521
[grunts] I've had it with that
little bug's goody-good act.

20:54.554 --> 20:55.655
Why?

20:55.688 --> 20:59.526
Because she reminds me
of someone I know. Me.

20:59.559 --> 21:01.561
[sighs] Anyway, we've gotta
go get Kaylie.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.563
In case the whole
lawyer thing doesn't work out,

21:03.596 --> 21:04.831
I have an idea
I want to try.

21:04.864 --> 21:07.734
It kinda helped me
when I was in the hospital.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.636
Come on, let's go.

21:09.669 --> 21:12.839
Otis? You dragged me out here
to find Otis?

21:12.872 --> 21:15.542
It's not like anyone else
had a better idea.

21:15.575 --> 21:18.578
Besides, when Jake
brought Otis to the hospital,

21:18.611 --> 21:20.513
I really think it helped.

21:20.547 --> 21:21.814
No, Lo. Otis didn't help.

21:21.848 --> 21:25.485
Dr. Walker, he helped. Honestly,
this is a waste of time.

21:25.518 --> 21:26.719
- Kaylie, wait.
- I'm sorry.

21:26.753 --> 21:28.788
I know that Otis is
silly good luck charm,

21:28.821 --> 21:31.491
but he's something
to believe in.

21:31.524 --> 21:33.526
So since we're here,
what have we got to lose?

21:33.560 --> 21:35.662
What makes you think that
humongous head is around here?

21:35.695 --> 21:38.565
Call it a hunch.
Jake gave me larkspur flowers.

21:38.598 --> 21:41.501
And the only larkspur flowers
on campus are rithe garden.

21:41.534 --> 21:42.769
I even asked one of
the groundskeepers.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.804
So what, you think
they buried him?

21:44.837 --> 21:47.574
No. I think
they disguised him.

21:47.607 --> 21:50.610
Jake said something about Otis
going deep, deep undercover.

22:06.559 --> 22:08.895
They didn't bury him,
they drowned him.

22:08.928 --> 22:11.531
- What?
- OK.

22:11.564 --> 22:14.601
He said he's "deep undercover."
He's in there!

22:14.634 --> 22:17.737
- This is ridiculous.
- You're not...

22:17.770 --> 22:19.706
- Oh, I can't believe
- Come on, help me.

22:20.840 --> 22:21.941
Uh...

22:24.644 --> 22:26.779
- [grunting]
- [girls laughing]

22:28.848 --> 22:30.883
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
It is Otis!

22:30.917 --> 22:32.919
Come on, Kay. Rub him for luck!

22:32.952 --> 22:34.854
Guys, I'm glad you found Otis,

22:34.887 --> 22:36.823
but this isn't a game,

22:36.856 --> 22:39.559
and Otis can't bring me luck.

22:39.592 --> 22:41.928
You know that. We all know that.

22:48.668 --> 22:49.802
[exhales]

22:49.836 --> 22:52.805
- [knocking]
- Mom! Dad! It's open!

22:52.839 --> 22:54.974
[door opens, closes]

23:00.647 --> 23:05.618
[panting] Austin.
What are you doing here?

23:05.652 --> 23:08.755
There's no reason in the world
that you should forgive me

23:08.788 --> 23:12.659
for the things that I said.
The way that I treated you.

23:12.692 --> 23:14.761
I was hurt that
I didn't make the team,

23:14.794 --> 23:16.829
but that's not an excuse.

23:16.863 --> 23:21.734
And I was embarrassed,
I didn't feel worthy of you.

23:21.768 --> 23:25.705
So I tried to blame you.
You should hate me for that.

23:25.738 --> 23:27.607
I know that I hate myself.

23:27.640 --> 23:28.908
So what, am I supposed to
feel bad for you?

23:28.941 --> 23:34.781
No. I just want you to know how
very sorry I am. That's all.

23:37.884 --> 23:39.986
Good luck at Trials.
I know you'll do great.

23:41.788 --> 23:43.656
I'm not competing in Trials.

23:44.991 --> 23:47.727
I failed the drug test.

23:47.760 --> 23:48.995
[Jordan] The drug test
is bogus.

23:49.028 --> 23:51.964
Kaylie is my roommate. I've seen
her eat and I know her habits.

23:51.998 --> 23:53.800
Her eating disorder
is under control

23:53.833 --> 23:54.934
she isn't taking anything.

23:54.967 --> 23:57.003
Drug tests don't lie.

23:57.036 --> 24:00.707
I'm sorry girls, there's nothing
we can do about this.

24:00.740 --> 24:02.942
Maybe you can't. But I can.

24:06.879 --> 24:07.880
What are you going to do?

24:10.983 --> 24:12.685
I'll boycott Trials.

24:16.789 --> 24:20.893
If Kaylie doesn't compete,
I don't compete.

24:25.832 --> 24:27.700
And I don't compete.

24:28.701 --> 24:29.769
Neither do I.

24:31.938 --> 24:34.941
Look, just let her compete and
then give her the blood test.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.876
You owe her that much.

24:39.078 --> 24:42.014
- The NGO doesn't
gi- [door closes]s.

24:42.048 --> 24:45.051
That was the worst case of
insubordination I've ever seen.

24:45.084 --> 24:49.722
That... or the greatest team
ever.

24:51.791 --> 24:56.696
The worst part is,
I'm being punished for
something I didn't do.

24:56.729 --> 24:59.065
My past is being held
against me and it's not fair.

24:59.098 --> 25:02.769
Don't give up.
Not as long as your father

25:02.802 --> 25:05.738
- is still fighting for you.
- God, it's just noise!

25:05.772 --> 25:09.008
Dad shouts and he makes threats,
but he doesn't do anything!

25:09.041 --> 25:10.910
What about your friends?
I'll bet they're trying to help.

25:10.943 --> 25:13.913
[chuckles] Do you know how
they're trying to help?

25:13.946 --> 25:16.783
They took me to go find Otis.

25:16.816 --> 25:19.051
How's that for a joke?

25:19.085 --> 25:21.821
They just probably see me
as one less competitor

25:21.854 --> 25:23.756
standing in their way
to the Olympics.

25:26.025 --> 25:28.961
I'm probably the last person
you want to hear this from,

25:28.995 --> 25:31.731
but I know what it's like
to lose a dream.

25:31.764 --> 25:32.965
I know what it is to feel bitter

25:32.999 --> 25:35.101
and lash out at people
who love you.

25:35.134 --> 25:39.005
Don't do it, Kaylie.
You're better than that.

25:39.038 --> 25:41.040
Look...

25:41.073 --> 25:43.009
...until the team boards that
plane for London,

25:43.042 --> 25:44.777
anything can still happen.

25:44.811 --> 25:46.813
And what if I just
can't believe that?

25:46.846 --> 25:50.783
Then you lose more than a dream.
You lose everything.

25:51.984 --> 25:53.986
[cell phone rings]

25:56.956 --> 25:58.858
It's Coach McIntire.

26:01.994 --> 26:05.765
[man over PA] Ladies and
gentlemen, welcome to the 2012

26:05.798 --> 26:07.967

26:34.961 --> 26:37.096
and the reason
we're here today,

26:37.129 --> 26:42.101

the United States 2012
Women's Gymnastics Team.

26:42.134 --> 26:45.104
- [cheering continues]
- [man olook at that.ould you

26:45.137 --> 26:48.207
Ladies and gentlemen,
it appears they have Otis.

26:55.014 --> 26:57.149
[applause]

27:20.106 --> 27:25.878
Listen, um, Coach told me
what you guys did.

27:27.179 --> 27:29.215
The risk you took
with Marcus. I...

27:29.248 --> 27:30.950
I don't know how to thank you.

27:30.983 --> 27:32.885
One-two-three, three-two-one.

27:32.919 --> 27:34.153
We all go to London.

27:34.186 --> 27:35.955
That's how you thank us.

27:35.988 --> 27:38.124
Now it's one-two-three-four.

27:40.159 --> 27:45.164
I'm still a bit rattled,
but whatever happens,

27:45.197 --> 27:48.034
you guys are my best friends.
And you always will be.

27:48.067 --> 27:50.036
[soft rock]

27:50.069 --> 27:52.238
[man over PA] Up first,
Kaylie Cruz on vault.

27:52.271 --> 27:54.006
- [cheering]
- You're still in this.

27:54.040 --> 27:55.107
Yeah.

27:56.909 --> 27:58.210
[Lauren] You got it, Kay.

27:58.244 --> 27:59.245
Good luck, Kaylie!

28:01.147 --> 28:02.214
[girls cheer]

28:04.216 --> 28:07.086
- You got this, Kaylie.
- Thanks, Coach.

28:09.255 --> 28:12.058
She looked ragged in warm-up.

28:12.091 --> 28:15.094
Considering she didn't know
an hour ago,eting up until

28:15.127 --> 28:17.196
I thought she looked
damn impressive.

28:21.033 --> 28:22.001
KP!

28:24.170 --> 28:25.905
I'm so glad you're here.

28:25.938 --> 28:27.139
Hey...

28:27.173 --> 28:30.109
This is your destiny, Kaylie.
I've always known that,

28:30.142 --> 28:32.044
even when you didn't.

28:32.078 --> 28:34.213
Don't let anyone
take that from you, OK?

28:35.214 --> 28:36.248
OK.

28:36.282 --> 28:39.185
Kill this one...
for the both of us.

28:41.153 --> 28:42.154
OK.

28:42.188 --> 28:44.123
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

28:44.156 --> 28:47.193
[man over PA] Up next,
Kaylie Cruz on vault.

28:47.226 --> 28:49.295
[applause]

28:51.097 --> 28:52.965
I don't see
after the day she had,

28:52.999 --> 28:54.133
how her head
can be in this.

28:54.166 --> 28:57.236
Well, lucky for her,
she's as hard headed as you.

28:57.269 --> 28:59.205
Let's hope.

29:01.173 --> 29:06.178
* But now I'm coming home *

29:10.516 --> 29:12.785
[* Tom Petty:
"I Won't Back Down"]

29:12.819 --> 29:15.421
* Hey, baby

29:15.454 --> 29:17.957
* There ain't no easy way out

29:19.491 --> 29:21.928
* Hey, I

29:23.429 --> 29:26.498
* Will stand my ground

29:26.532 --> 29:28.167
- [cheering]
- Yeah!

29:28.200 --> 29:31.037
That's it Kaylie!
Way to land it!

29:32.939 --> 29:35.241
Did you see that Chenko
full on full off?

29:35.274 --> 29:39.011
Genji Cho is the only other girl
in the world with one.

29:39.979 --> 29:40.947
Outstanding!

29:40.980 --> 29:43.015
[chuckles] Outstanding.

29:43.049 --> 29:45.251
- Thanks, Coach.
- Lookin' good, girl.

29:45.284 --> 29:48.955
- Good job.
- Too bad you won't
be going to London.

29:48.988 --> 29:52.024
* Won't back down

29:52.058 --> 29:55.094
- * Hey, baby
- This team could
really use her.

29:55.127 --> 29:57.129
It's all up to the blood tests.

29:57.163 --> 29:59.198
And we both know
what they're gonna say.

29:59.231 --> 30:01.100
Give it up, Mac.

30:01.133 --> 30:05.104
[man over PA] Up next,
Jordan Randall on uneven bars.

30:05.137 --> 30:07.173
- [cheering]
- Hey.

30:09.041 --> 30:12.144
I understand now why you
wouldn't do the Layout Jordan.

30:12.178 --> 30:14.146
It's because you refuse
to let Coach Keegan

30:14.180 --> 30:16.248
own even a small piece
of your victories.

30:16.282 --> 30:18.985
But this triple back dismount
is different.

30:19.018 --> 30:22.288
It's all you.
Nobody else can claim it.

30:22.321 --> 30:25.091
I want you to show everyone
what you can do.

30:25.124 --> 30:27.126
I'm gonna smoke
that triple.

30:27.159 --> 30:30.262
Now, maybe you better step back
before you get burned.

30:30.296 --> 30:32.231
[cheering]

30:32.264 --> 30:35.234

- [* The DNC: "Electric"]
- * Yes, that's my
favorite girl *

30:42.174 --> 30:44.043
* Every time we're together
it gets electrical *

30:44.076 --> 30:46.045
* We attracted to each other
like two opposite poles.

30:46.078 --> 30:48.080

we can't say no *

30:48.114 --> 30:49.949

and won't say no *

else like it *

don't wanna ever feel
another feeling *

- [cheering]

31:14.206 --> 31:17.977
[man over PA]
Wow, would you look at that,
ladies and gentlemen.

31:18.010 --> 31:21.180
Jordan Randall just landed
a triple back dismount.

31:25.017 --> 31:25.351
[chuckles]

31:27.353 --> 31:30.322
- Borrow your lip gloss?
- Oh, No! Um...

31:30.356 --> 31:33.192
Sorry. I'm sort of
a germaphobe.

31:33.225 --> 31:35.094
So, what did you mean
when you said,

31:35.127 --> 31:37.997
"too bad Kaylie's not
going to London"?

31:38.030 --> 31:39.165
What?

31:39.198 --> 31:42.034
Just, well, she's taking
pseudoephedrine,

31:42.068 --> 31:44.336
and that shows up in your blood,
not just your urine.

31:44.370 --> 31:46.338
Well, aren't you the expert.

31:46.372 --> 31:48.140
How did you know
what she was taking?

31:49.341 --> 31:52.078
[scoffs] Everyone knows,
don't they?

31:52.111 --> 31:56.215
No. Actually, Kaylie didn't want
anyone to know.

Testing, one, two, three.

32:07.126 --> 32:09.095
You spike five times,
I stop you.

32:09.128 --> 32:11.163
Do not make me
blow this whistle.

32:11.197 --> 32:12.264
- I won't.
- OK.

32:14.133 --> 32:16.402
- [exhales]
- [steady beeping]

32:29.448 --> 32:31.250
How many times has she
successfully made it

32:31.283 --> 32:33.052
through her routine
without spiking?

32:33.085 --> 32:35.254
She hasn't. And that's
just in practice.

32:35.287 --> 32:38.090
Now add the stress
of competition...

32:38.124 --> 32:40.059
And there is no way
she finishes.

35:43.342 --> 35:44.443

35:44.476 --> 35:47.446
So, if I play it safe
and do my Swan Lake routine,

35:47.479 --> 35:49.348
I'm almost guaranteed
a spot the team.

35:49.381 --> 35:51.317
Payson, that's fantastic!

35:51.350 --> 35:54.486
[country ballad playing]

35:54.520 --> 35:56.388
But safe isn't what you want,
is it?

35:56.422 --> 35:59.691
Remember when you told me once
that I put everything,

35:59.725 --> 36:01.627
my emotions,
into little boxes?

36:01.660 --> 36:03.562
Mm-hm.

36:03.595 --> 36:05.597
I feel like I've been
put into one.

36:05.631 --> 36:07.433
And I want to break out
and be free.

36:07.466 --> 36:09.501
But, if Coach McIntire
doesn't like my new routine,

36:09.535 --> 36:11.570
it could cost me everything,
my place on the team.

36:11.603 --> 36:14.440
And after everything you and Mom
have sacrificed I'm afraid to...

36:14.473 --> 36:17.409
Stop. I don't want you
talking like...

36:17.443 --> 36:18.677
...a Keeler. [chuckles]

36:18.710 --> 36:21.647
We're not the Cruzes,
we're not the Tanners.

36:21.680 --> 36:24.650
We're safe.
We always have been.

36:24.683 --> 36:26.652
I mean, look at me,
I'm not a very exciting guy.

36:26.685 --> 36:29.488
- Dad...
- I'm serious. I play it safe.

36:29.521 --> 36:32.524
And you carry your family
history with you.

36:32.558 --> 36:34.493
We all do.

36:34.526 --> 36:37.363
But if you're lucky,
you can transcend it.

36:37.396 --> 36:42.501
I want you to transcend it.
Here. Now.

36:42.534 --> 36:46.405

No. You don't.

38:01.680 --> 38:05.717
* Always pushing my luck
with the spirits above *

38:08.687 --> 38:11.857
* My heart is not crazy
it's just too complex *

38:14.860 --> 38:17.463
* And with four
different lovers *

38:17.496 --> 38:20.566
* You don't get much rest

38:20.599 --> 38:25.571
* Well I've gone
and created a mess *

38:27.506 --> 38:30.576
* So please save some
forgiveness for me *

38:31.543 --> 38:32.811
[cheering]

38:32.844 --> 38:38.784
* A man blinded by love
can't think clearly *

38:47.526 --> 38:51.797
* So please save some
forgiveness for me **

38:56.535 --> 38:58.670
- [cheering]
- [girl] Go, Payson!

38:58.704 --> 39:02.541
- [boy] Payson!
- Yeah!

39:06.612 --> 39:07.579
[man over PA]
Well, ladies and gentlemen,

39:07.613 --> 39:09.648
that wraps up the competition.

39:09.681 --> 39:12.718
The US Women's Olympic Team
will be announced shortly.

39:14.886 --> 39:19.658
Objectively, these are
our top five finishers.

39:19.691 --> 39:23.729
Is there any reason we shouldn't
make them our 2012 Olympic team?

39:23.762 --> 39:28.867
You and I both know we let
Kaylie compether friends.

39:28.900 --> 39:32.771
But she tested positive
for pseudoephedrine.

39:32.804 --> 39:35.741
There's no way the NGO can
set that kind of precedent.

39:35.774 --> 39:37.776
She's out.

39:40.779 --> 39:42.681
You were amazing
out there, sweetie.

39:42.714 --> 39:44.550
We are so proud of you, honey.

39:44.583 --> 39:46.718
And this blood test
is gonna prove

39:46.752 --> 39:48.554
they were wrong about
you taking drugs.

39:48.587 --> 39:51.590
[panting] They weren't
wrong about her.

39:51.623 --> 39:53.925
She's gonna
test positive again.

39:53.959 --> 39:55.861
[McIntire] I really think
we should reconsider Laur...

39:57.763 --> 39:59.598
It was that little bitch Wendy.

40:02.968 --> 40:06.672
I'm so proud of you, Sasha,
I hope you are too.

40:07.706 --> 40:08.840
I am.

40:10.809 --> 40:12.711
But there are also regrets.

40:14.746 --> 40:16.848
Emily?

40:16.882 --> 40:18.717
Yeah.

40:19.685 --> 40:20.952
And you.

40:23.755 --> 40:25.657
How did I lose you?

40:25.691 --> 40:26.858
Why didn't I try harder to...

40:26.892 --> 40:28.927
You did try.

40:28.960 --> 40:31.797
We both did,
but some things just...

40:31.830 --> 40:33.899
...aren't possible.

40:51.783 --> 40:53.985
Don't tell me you stopped
believing in miracles.

41:00.726 --> 41:03.762
Yes, I ordered some medicine
for my cold.

41:03.795 --> 41:05.864
But when I found out it was
on the banned substance list,

41:05.897 --> 41:07.766
I threw it all away.

41:07.799 --> 41:08.834
You're lying.

41:08.867 --> 41:09.935
I'll bet you put it in all those

41:09.968 --> 41:11.637
fruit smoothies
you made for Kaylie.

41:11.670 --> 41:14.673
The ones you wouldn't
let anyone else drink, Wendy.

41:14.706 --> 41:17.776
[scoffs] But, why would
I do that? I like Kaylie.

41:17.809 --> 41:19.978
If I wanted to drug
someone it would be... you.

41:20.011 --> 41:21.780
- What did you just say?!
- Damn it,

41:21.813 --> 41:23.782
tell the truth, Wendy.
You drugged me, didn't you?!

41:23.815 --> 41:28.754
Lauren, unless you have some
proof tthe medicine...lly used

41:30.989 --> 41:31.990
[sniffs]

41:32.023 --> 41:33.925
Strawberry lip gloss.

41:35.894 --> 41:37.829
It's in the bag,
it's in her lip gloss case!

41:37.863 --> 41:39.665
- Give me this!
- Give...

41:39.698 --> 41:40.899
- Give it back!
- Hey, let go!

41:40.932 --> 41:43.702
- Let me have it.
- Girls. That's enough!

41:56.748 --> 41:59.885
[man over PA] Ladies and
gentlemen, please take your
seats.

42:00.952 --> 42:02.721
[McIntire] It has been
my privilege

42:02.754 --> 42:04.923
these past eight weeks

42:04.956 --> 42:07.926
to coach a group of girls
who have continually

42:07.959 --> 42:10.028
surprised me
with their strength,

42:10.061 --> 42:12.764
their stamina, their skill,

42:12.798 --> 42:15.967
and their sheer will
to perform at levels

42:16.001 --> 42:20.071
that never failed to impress
and inspire me.

42:21.807 --> 42:23.108
How about a hand
for all our girls.

42:29.948 --> 42:33.752
In the end,
five girls stood out.

42:34.986 --> 42:38.824
I believe these five girls,
individually and as a team,

42:38.857 --> 42:40.992
will bring not only honor,

42:41.026 --> 42:44.062
but Olympic gold
to the United States.

42:44.095 --> 42:46.832
I am proud to announce

42:46.865 --> 42:51.770
the 2012 US Women's
Gymnastics Team.

42:51.803 --> 42:52.804
They are...

42:53.905 --> 42:56.141
[pop music fades in]

42:58.844 --> 43:01.079
- Jordan Randall.
- [crowd cheering]

43:04.950 --> 43:05.984
Payson Keeler.

43:08.854 --> 43:10.956
- Yeah!
- [shrieking]

43:10.989 --> 43:12.791
Kaylie Cruz.

43:16.161 --> 43:18.029
This is happening!

43:18.063 --> 43:20.966
Colleen Evans and...

43:23.969 --> 43:24.970
Lauren Tanner!

43:30.909 --> 43:32.911
[all sobbing]

43:32.944 --> 43:34.813
Oh my God!

43:34.846 --> 43:37.115
- We're going to London.
- I know.

43:37.148 --> 43:39.985
- Is this real life?
- [screaming]

43:42.854 --> 43:44.923
London! London!

43:44.956 --> 43:47.926
[all] London! London! London!

43:47.959 --> 43:51.129
- [* Kevin Rudolf:
- You took Otis!

43:51.162 --> 43:54.800
* I've been high
I've been low *

43:54.833 --> 43:58.937
* Travelled down
every single road *

43:58.970 --> 44:00.872
* Just 'cause they
never done this *

44:00.906 --> 44:03.074
* Got nothing to do with you

44:03.108 --> 44:08.847
Ladies and gentlemen,
the US Olympic Gymnastics Team.

44:08.880 --> 44:10.849
[crowd cheers]

44:10.882 --> 44:12.984
[whistling]

44:13.018 --> 44:16.888
* Don't look back
We've come too far *

44:16.922 --> 44:20.959
* Baby you were born
to be a star *

44:20.992 --> 44:24.930
* Whoa, whoa

44:24.963 --> 44:28.033

44:31.169 --> 44:34.172
* It's gonna come around *
