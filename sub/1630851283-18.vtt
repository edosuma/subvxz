>> 77 YEARS AGO, IN THIS

00:10.677 --> 00:18.351
AMSTERDAM ANNEX, ANNE FRANK, HER
FAMILY, AND FOUR OTHERS WERE
DISCOVERED BY THE NAZIS AFTER
MORE THAN TWO YEARS IN HIDING.

00:18.418 --> 00:22.722
OH, WOW.
THIS-- THIS IS THE FAMOUS--
>> THIS IS THE BOOKCASE.
>> BOOKCASE.

00:22.789 --> 00:27.660
>> TH-- THIS IS THE BOOKCASE.
IT WAS USED TO CAMOUFLAGE THE
ENTRANCE TO THE HIDING PLACE.
>> IT'S ONE OF THE MOST WELL-

00:27.727 --> 00:35.435
KNOWN ACCOUNTS OF LIFE UNDER
NAZI OCCUPATION, AND ONE WITHOUT
A CRITICAL ANSWER: WHO BETRAYED
ANNE FRANK'S FAMILY?

00:35.502 --> 00:41.808
THIS RETIRED F.B.I. AGENT, AND
HIS ALL STAR TEAM OF
INVESTIGATORS, BELIEVE THEY HAVE
FINALLY FOUND THE ANSWER-- AND A

00:41.875 --> 00:47.480
SURPRISING TWIST.
WAIT, WAIT.
SO, IN THE FILES, THER'S
REFERENCE TO A NOTE THAT OTTO

00:47.547 --> 00:51.818
FRANK RECEIVED THAT MENTIONS
THIS SPECIFIC NAME?
>> REMARKABLY SO.
YES.

THOSE STORIES, TONIGHT, ON
"60 MINUTES."

01:52.879 --> 02:00.253
PUBLICATION, "THE DIARY OF ANNE
FRANK" REMAINS AMONG THE MOST
WIDELY-READ BOOKS IN THE WORLD.
BLINKERING BETWEEN HOPE AND

02:00.320 --> 02:07.760
DESPAIR, THE ACCOUNT OF A JEWISH
TEENAGER'S LIFE IN HIDING IN AN
ANNEX BEHIND AN AMSTERDAM
WAREHOUSE, GAVE VOICE AND A FACE

02:07.827 --> 02:17.670
TO MILLIONS OF VICTIMS OF THE
NAZI GENOCIDE.
YET ONE QUESTION HAS GONE
STUBBORNLY UNANSWERED ALL THESE

02:17.737 --> 02:20.306
YEARS: WHO ALERTED THE NAZI
SEARCH TEAM, IN 1944, TO ANNE
FRANK AND HER FAMILY'S HIDING
PLACE?

02:20.373 --> 02:27.146
TWO DUTCH POLICE INQUIRIES AND
COUNTLESS HISTORIANS HAVE COME
UP WITH THEORIES, BUT NO FIRM
CONCLUSIONS.

02:27.213 --> 02:34.988
THEN, IN 2016, A TEAM OF
INVESTIGATORS, LED BY A VETERAN
F.B.I. AGENT, DECIDED TO BRING
MODERN CRIME-SOLVING TECHNIQUES

02:35.054 --> 02:41.361
AND TECHNOLOGY TO THIS COLD
CASE.
AND NOW, THEY BELIEVE THEY HAVE
AN ANSWER, ONE WE'LL SHARE WITH

02:41.427 --> 02:49.469
YOU TONIGHT, TO A QUESTION
THAT'S BEDEVILED HISTORIANS, AND
HAUNTED HOLLAND: WHO WAS
RESPONSIBLE, FOR THE BETRAYAL?

02:49.536 --> 02:55.408
>> VINCE PANKOKE HAD TURNED IN
HIS BADGE AND GUN.
HE WAS TWO YEARS INTO A
COMFORTABLE FLORIDA RETIREMENT,

02:55.475 --> 03:02.615
WHEN HIS PHONE RANG IN THE
SPRING OF 2016.
>> I RECEIVED A CALL FROM A
COLLEAGUE FROM THE NETHERLANDS

03:02.682 --> 03:07.654
WHO SAID, "IF YOU-- IF YOU'RE
DONE LAYING ON THE BEACH, WE
HAVE A CASE FOR YOU."
>> WERE YOU LAYING ON THE BEACH?

03:07.720 --> 03:14.661
>> I WAS ACTUALLY DRIVING TO THE
BEACH.
I WASN'T QUITE THERE YET.
>> PANKOKE SPENT THREE DECADES

03:14.727 --> 03:20.099
AS AN F.B.I. SPECIAL AGENT,
TARGETING COLOMBIAN DRUG
CARTELS.
HIS WORK HAD ALSO TAKEN HIM TO

03:20.166 --> 03:24.671
THE NETHERLANDS, WHERE HIS
INVESTIGATIVE CHOPS LEFT AN
IMPRESSION.
>> WERE YOU LOOKING TO GET BACK

03:24.737 --> 03:32.579
WHEN HE TOLD YOU WHAT IT WAS
ABOUT?
>> AFTER HE TOLD ME IT WAS TO,
YOU KNOW, TRY TO SOLVE THE

03:32.645 --> 03:41.054
MYSTERY OF WHAT CAUSED THE RAID
FOR ANNE FRANK AND THE OTHERS IN
THE ANNEX, I NEEDED TO HEAR
MORE.

03:41.120 --> 03:46.059
>> 4,000 MILES AWAY, IN
AMSTERDAM, THIJS BAYENS, A DUTCH
FILMMAKER AND DOCUMENTARIAN, HAD
BEEN ASKING AROUND FOR A

03:46.125 --> 03:52.532
CREDENTIALED INVESTIGATOR TO DIG
INTO A QUESTION THAT HE FEELS
HOLLAND HAS NEVER QUITE RECKONED
WITH, ONE THAT GETS TO THE

03:52.599 --> 04:02.308
ESSENCE OF HUMAN NATURE.
>> FOR ME, IT WAS REALLY
IMPORTANT TO INVESTIGATE WHAT
MAKES US GIVE UP ON EACH OTHER.

04:02.375 --> 04:09.649
THE AREA WHERE ANNE FRANK LIVED
IS VERY NORMAL, AND IT'S A VERY
WARM AREA WITH THE BUTCHER AND
THE DOCTOR AND THE POLICEMAN.

04:09.716 --> 04:14.821
THEY WORKED TOGETHER.
THEY LOVED EACH OTHER.
THEY LIVED TOGETHER.
AND SUDDENLY PEOPLE START TO

04:14.887 --> 04:20.193
BETRAY ON EACH OTHER.
HOW COULD THAT HAPPEN?
>> OF THE MILLIONS, LITERALLY
MILLIONS OF STORIES TO COME OUT

04:20.259 --> 04:28.835
OF THE HOLOCAUST, WHY DO YOU
THINK THIS ONE RESONATES THE WAY
IT DOES?
>> I THINK RIGHT AFTER THE WAR

04:28.901 --> 04:34.407
PEOPLE WERE SHOWN THE
CONCENTRATION CAMPS, THE
ATROCITIES THAT TOOK PLACE, THE
HORROR.

04:34.474 --> 04:43.249
AND, SUDDENLY, YOU FIND THIS
INNOCENT, BEAUTIFUL, VERY SMART,
FUNNY, TALENTED GIRL.
AND SHE AS A LIGHTHOUSE COMES

04:43.316 --> 04:51.290
OUT OF THE DARKNESS.
AND THEN I THINK HUMANITY SAID,
"THIS IS WHO WE ARE."
>> BETRAYING FELLOW DUTCH TO THE

04:51.357 --> 04:58.665
NAZIS WAS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE IN
THE NETHERLANDS, BUT TWO POLICE
PROBES AND A WHOLE LIBRARY OF
BOOKS DEDICATED TO THE ANNE

04:58.731 --> 05:06.806
FRANK CASE, YIELDED NEITHER
CONVICTIONS NOR DEFINITIVE
CONCLUSIONS.
THIS QUESTION OF WHO BETRAYED

05:06.873 --> 05:13.212
ANNE FRANK, THAT HAD BEEN
INVESTIGATED FOR YEARS.
WHAT WAS GOING TO MAKE YOUR
INVESTIGATION DIFFERENT THAN THE

05:13.279 --> 05:18.418
ONES BEFORE IT?
>> IF IT'S A CRIMINAL ACT,
IT SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED BY THE
POLICE.

05:18.484 --> 05:23.556
SO WE SET IT UP AS A COLD CASE.
>> LIKE SO MANY, PANKOKE HAD
READ THE DIARY IN MIDDLE SCHOOL
IN WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA AND IT

05:23.623 --> 05:30.663
LEFT A MARK.
THERE WOULD BE NO PERP WALKS OR
BUSTED CRIME SYNDICATES HERE,
BUT HE WAS INTRIGUED,

05:30.730 --> 05:38.805
CAUTIOUSLY.
YOU HEAR, "WE'RE GOING TO GO
BACK AND LOOK AT ANNE FRANK."
AND THAT MIGHT HAVE THE RING OF

05:38.871 --> 05:42.742
SOME SCHLOCKY MEDIA CREATION.
DID THAT WORRY YOU?
>> OH, IT DID. IT DID, BECAUSE
AS A CAREER INVESTIGATOR, I

05:42.809 --> 05:48.014
DIDN'T WNAT TO BE ASSOCIATED
WITH ANY TYPE OF A TABLOID TYPE
INVESTIGATION.
>> YOU HAD TO MAKE SURE THIS WAS

05:48.081 --> 05:57.323
SERIOUS.
>> LET'S FACE IT, I MEAN, THE
HONOR OF THE DIARY, THE HONOR
OF ANNE FRANK, WE HAD TO TREAT

05:57.390 --> 06:10.536
THIS WITH UTMOST RESPECT.
>> WHAT ULTIMATELY SEALED IT
THE GUARANTEE OF ABSOLUTE
AUTONOMY.

06:10.603 --> 06:16.242
THERE WOULD BE A BOOK ABOUT IT
WHICH HELPED FINANCE THE PROJECT
ALONG WITH FUNDING FROM THE CITY
OF AMSTERDAM.

06:16.309 --> 06:22.782
BUT THIS WAS GOING TO BE AN
INDEPENDENT UNDERTAKING WITH
SERIOUS INVESTIGATORS.
AND VINCE PANKOKE WAS GOING TO

06:22.849 --> 06:29.756
TAKE THE LEAD DIGGING IN.
YOU HAD DONE COLD BASES BEFORE.
BEFORE THIS, WHAT WAS THE
BIGGEST GAP IN TIME BETWEEN WHEN

06:29.822 --> 06:33.893
YOU WERE APROSMED AND THE CRIME
OCCURRED?
>> IT WAS ABOUT A FIVE-YEAR
CRIME AT THAT POINT.

06:33.960 --> 06:37.663
>> 75 YEARS, SO IT'S A LITTLE
DIFFERENT.
>> IT'S A LOT DIFFERENT.
>> THIS IS MORE THAN COLD.

06:37.730 --> 06:43.736
>> YEAH, THIS WAS FROZEN.
>> TO CHIP AWAY, PANKOKE HAD TO
DRAW UP HIS OWN BLUEPRINT.
HE KNEW THAT THERE WAS GOING TO

06:43.803 --> 06:52.245
BE MORE INFORMATION TO PLOW
THROUGH THAN ANY HUMAN COULD
HANDLE AND THAT ARTIFICIAL
INTELLIGENCE COULD BE A SECRET

06:52.311 --> 07:00.520
WEAPON.
AN F.B.I.'S DREAM TEAM WAS
ASSEMBLED: AN INVESTIGATIVE
PSYCHOLOGIST, HISTORIANS,

07:00.586 --> 07:05.825
CRIMINOLOGISTS, PLUS AN ARMY OF
ARCHIVAL RESEARCHERS.
WHAT DID ALL THESE PEOPLE WITH
DISPARATE SKILLS BRING TO THIS?

07:05.892 --> 07:11.197
>> THEY BROUGHT A DIFFERENT
VIEW.
IT WAS ALL OF THESE SKILLS THAT
HELP US UNDERSTAND AND PUT INTO

07:11.264 --> 07:26.145
CONTEXT A CRIME THAT HAPPENED IN
1944 WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THINGS
DIFFERENTLY.
>> TOGETHER, THEY DOVE INTO A

07:26.212 --> 07:28.681
FAMILIAR STORY.
THE FRANK FAMILY HAD MOVED TO
AMSTERDAM FROM GERMANY TO ESCAPE
THE RISE OF HITLER.

07:28.748 --> 07:31.250
THEY FOUND SAFETY IN HOLLAND,
WHERE OTTO FRANK RAN A
MANUFACTURING BUSINESS.
BUT THEN, THE NAZIS INVADED IN

07:31.317 --> 07:43.129
1940.
TWO YEARS LATER, THE
TWO YEARS LATER, THE FRANKS--
OTTO, WIFE EDITH, ANNE, AND HER

07:43.196 --> 07:48.501
SISTER, MARGOT,
ALONG WITH FOUR OTHER JEWISH
FRIENDS OF THE FAMILY WENT INTO
HIDING IN AN ANNEX BEHIND OTTO'S

07:48.568 --> 07:51.404
WAREHOUSE.
TODAY IT'S PRESERVED AS A MUSEUM
DR. GERTJAN BROEK, A HISTORIAN
AT THE ANNE FRANK HOUSE, SHOWED

07:51.470 --> 08:01.080
US IN.
OH, WOW. THIS-- THIS IS THE
FAMOUS BOOKCASE.
>> THIS IS THE BOOKCASE-

08:01.147 --> 08:07.053
IT WAS USED TO CAMOUFLAGE THE
ENTRANCE TO THE HIDING PLACE.
>> THE BOOKCASE HELPED PROTECT
THE FRANKS, AS DID A HANDFUL OF

08:07.119 --> 08:11.958
OTTO'S CLOSE COLLEAGUES AT THE
WAREHOUSE WHO WERE IN ON THE
SECRET.
>> WE GO INSIDE, MIND YOUR HEAD.

08:12.024 --> 08:16.829
>> OH, WOW
AFTER THE RAID, THE NAZIS TOOK
ANYTHING THAT WASN'T NAILED
DOWN.

08:16.896 --> 08:25.872
THESE RECREATIONS SHOW WHAT IT
LOOKED LIKE: TWO CRAMMED FLOORS,
761 DAYS, MORE THAN TWO
EXCRUCIATING YEARS INDOORS.

08:25.938 --> 08:31.110
THE OFFICE WORKERS BROUGHT FOOD
AND SUPPLIES, BUT THE EIGHT IN
HIDING COULDN'T MAKE A SOUND
DURING THE DAY.

08:31.177 --> 08:36.682
BY NIGHT, THEY COULD LISTEN TO
THE RADIO, DESPERATELY PLOTTING
UPDATES FROM THE FRONT ON THIS
MAP.

08:36.749 --> 08:47.693
>> HERE'S A NEWSPAPER CLIPPING
FROM SHORTLY AFTER D-DAY-- SO
JUNE, 1944-- WITH THE PINS THAT
TRIED TO FOLLOW THE ADVANCES OF

08:47.760 --> 08:58.905
THE ALLIED TROOPS IN THE DAYS
AND WEEKS PROBABLY AFTER.
>> THIS IS JUNE, 1944.
>> JUNE 1944--

08:58.971 --> 09:06.212
SO THERE'S HOPE BECAUSE ALLIED
FORCES ARE ON THE WAY.
THEIR LIFE DEPENDED ON WHAT
WOULD HAPPEN.

09:06.279 --> 09:10.816
>> ANNE'S BEDROOM WALLS-
FAMILIAR TO ANY TEENAGER--
PRESERVED FROM THE DAY SHE WAS
TAKEN AWAY.

09:10.883 --> 09:15.821
HERE, SHE CHRONICLED THE
MONOTONY AND THE HORROR OF LIFE
IN HIDING.
"OUTSIDE THINGS ARE TERRIBLE,

09:15.888 --> 09:20.226
DAY AND NIGHT" SHE WROTE IN
JANUARY 1943.
"THESE POOR PEOPLE ARE BEING
DRAGGED AWAY, WITH NOTHING BUT A

09:20.293 --> 09:24.497
BACKPACK AND A LITTLE BIT OF
MONEY."
HER LAST ENTRY WAS DATED AUGUST
1, 1944.

09:24.563 --> 09:32.204
SHE WAS 15.
TAKE ME TO THE DAY OF THE RAID.
IT'S THE SUMMER OF 1944, AND
WHAT HAPPENS THAT DAY?

09:32.271 --> 09:40.379
>> IT'S A WARM DAY, SUNNY.
AND AROUND 10:30, BETWEEN 10:30
AND 11:00, A COUPLE OF MEN WALK
IN.

09:40.446 --> 09:48.187
>> THEY WERE DETECTIVES WITH A
DUTCH POLICE UNIT WORKING WITH
THE NAZIS.
AN S.S. OFFICER NAMED

09:48.254 --> 09:54.360
SILBERBAUER LEAD THE TEAM.
THEY DEMANDED TO BE SHOWN AROUND
ARE THE WAREHOUSE.
>> THEY END UP IN FRONT OF THE

09:54.427 --> 09:59.765
BOOKCASE WHICH IS HIDING THE
ENTRANCE TO THE ANNEX.
AND IT'S IMPORTANT, I THINK, TO
REALIZE THAT TWO OF THE

09:59.832 --> 10:04.537
POLICEMEN PRESENT HAD BEEN
SEASONED DETECTIVES, WELL
EXPERIENCED.
THEY HAD BEEN SEARCHING THIS

10:04.603 --> 10:11.143
TYPE OF BUILDING IN THE INNER
CITY OF AMSTERDAM BEFORE.
>> THEY KNEW THERE WAS LIKELY
SOMETHING BEHIND THAT BOOKCASE.

10:11.210 --> 10:18.617
THE STUNNED INHABITANTS THEY
FOUND WERE MARCHED OUT.
ON THE FLOOR BEHIND THEM, ANNE'S
DIARY, WHICH A QUICK-THINKING

10:18.684 --> 10:25.791
OFFICE WORKER LOYAL TO THE
FRANKS, PRESERVED.
OF THE EIGHT TAKEN AWAY, OTTO
FRANK WAS THE ONLY SURVIVOR.

10:25.858 --> 10:35.968
THE OTHERS WERE AMONG THE
100,000 DUTCH YOUS TOO DIE AT
THE HANDS OF THE NAUGHTIES.
IN AN INTERVIEW WITH CBS IN

10:36.035 --> 10:41.207
1964, OTTO RECOUNTED WHAT
HAPPENED WHEN HIS FAMILY WAS PUT
ON THE CATTLE CARS TO AUSCHWITZ
A MONTH AFTER THEIR CAPTURE.

10:41.273 --> 10:59.592
>> ON SEPTEMBER 4, 1944, WHEN WE
ARRIVED IN AUSCHWITZ, THERE WERE
MEN STANDING THERE WITH CLUBS.
"WOMEN HERE, MEN THERE."

10:59.658 --> 11:08.734
WE WERE SEPARATED RIGHT IN THE
STATION.
THE WOMEN WENT TO BERK NOW CAMP
AND WE WENT TO AUSCHWITZ CAMP.

11:08.801 --> 11:16.776
I NEVER SAW MY FAMILY AGAIN.
>> AFTER THE WAR, OTTO FRANK WAS
DETERMINED TO FIND OUT WHO
BETRAYED THE HIDING PLACE TO THE

11:16.842 --> 11:21.680
NAZIS.
IT WAS THE QUESTION MANY READERS
ASKED AFTER HE PUBLISHED HIS
DAUGHTER'S DIARY IN 1947.

11:21.747 --> 11:29.488
BUT AFTER A COUPLE OF YEARS OTTO
ABRUPTLY STOPPED LOOKING.
MORE ON THAT CURIOUS DECISION
LATER.

11:29.555 --> 11:36.629
WHEN VINCE PANKOKE WENT TO
AMSTERDAM TO BEGIN HIS SEARCH,
HIS FIRST STOP, NATURALLY, WAS
THE SCREEN OF THE CRIME.

11:36.695 --> 11:43.769
>> I CALL THIS THE MOST VISITED
CRIME SCENE IN THE WORLD,
BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE FROM ALL
OVERLET WORLD, YOU KNOW,

11:43.836 --> 11:48.340
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE COME HERE.
>> SO WHEN YOU COME HERE FOR THE
FIRST TIME, WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING
FOR?

11:48.407 --> 11:55.681
>> WELL, AS AN INVESTIGATOR, I
WANT TO SEE WHAT'S IN THE AREA.
OF COURSE I WANT TO SEE INSIDE
THE BUILDING.

11:55.748 --> 12:04.557
I WANT TO RECONSTRUCT HOW THE
ACTUAL ARREST TOOK PLACE AND WHO
PARTICIPATED IN IT.
>> PANKOKE AND HIS TEAM SPENT

12:04.623 --> 12:11.097
HOURS IN THE ANNEX LOOKING FOR
ANY CLUE, HOWEVER REMOTE.
>> SO YOU CAN SEE IT RIGHT
THROUGH THOSE BUSHES.

12:11.163 --> 12:19.572
>> HE ALSO CASED THE EXTERIOR,
TODAY ALMOST EXACTLY AS IT WAS
THEN.
>> THIS IS THE COURTYARD THAT IS

12:19.638 --> 12:27.680
BEHIND THE ANNEX, AND IT'S, AS
YOU CAN SEE, IT'S TOTALLY
ENCLOSED.
THIS COURTYARD AREA IS

12:27.746 --> 12:33.119
SURROUNDED BY THE BUILDINGS OF
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
>> I THINK THE ONE COUGH THAT
GETS OVERHEARD, ONE WINDOW THAT

12:33.185 --> 12:39.158
HAPPENS TO BE OPEN AT THE WRONG
TIME, THE SHEER RISK FACTOR HERE
IS EXTRAORDINARY.
>> IT IS EXTRAORDINARY.

12:39.225 --> 12:47.700
WHEN WE FIRST STARTED THE CASE,
ONE OF THE THEORIES THAT WAS OUT
THERE IS THAT THE RAID MAY HAVE
BEEN CAUSED BY SOMEBODY IN THE

12:47.766 --> 12:55.074
IMMEDIATE AREA SEEING SOMETHING,
HEARING SOMETHING, AND REPORTING
IT.
SO, THEREFORE, WE TRACKED AND

12:55.141 --> 13:02.081
IDENTIFIED EVERY RESIDENT THAT
LIVED IN THIS BLOCK AND ADJACENT
STREETS.
>> USING THE ARTIFICIAL

13:02.148 --> 13:07.720
INTELLIGENCE PROGRAM, PANKOKE
AND HIS TEAM MAPPED POTENTIAL
THREATS.
IN THE COURTYARD SURROUNDING THE

13:07.786 --> 13:13.792
ANNEX, THEY FOUND NAZI PARTY
MEMBERS AND EVEN KNOWN
INFORMANTS.
>> ALL LIVING JUST A WALL OR TWO

13:13.859 --> 13:19.598
AWAY FROM ONE ANOTHER.
WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE
THREATS, THE QUESTION ISN'T, YOU
KNOW, WHAT CAUSED THE RAID?

13:19.665 --> 13:27.473
THE QUESTION MIGHT BE HOW DID
THEY LAST MORE THAN TWO YEARS
WITHOUT BEING DISCOVERED?
>> IT STRIKES ME IN A CASE LIKE

13:27.540 --> 13:35.681
THIS ANYONE COULD BE A SUSPECT--
A NAZI SYMPATHIZER, AN
INFORMANT, SOMEONE WHO HAPPENS
TO WALK BY AND HEAR A COUGH.

13:35.748 --> 13:42.821
HOW DID YOU NAVIGATE THAT?
>> WE HAD TO CONSIDER ALL THOSE
OPTIONS.
THE TEAM AND I SAT DOWN AND WE

13:42.888 --> 13:48.594
COMPILED A LIST OF WAYS IN WHICH
THE ANNEX COULD HAVE BEEN
COMPROMISED.
YOU KNOW, WAS IT CARELESSNESS O

13:48.661 --> 13:56.068
THE PEOPLE OCCUPYING THE ANNEX,
MAYBE MAKING TOO MUCH NOISE OR
BEING SEEN IN THE WINDOWS?
YOU KNOW, WAS IT BETRAYAL?

13:56.135 --> 14:01.607
>> THERE IS A THEORY OUT THERE
THAT NO ONE BETRAYED THE FRANK
FAMILY.
THIS WAS COINCIDENCE OR THIS WAS

14:01.674 --> 14:06.745
GOOD DETECTIVE WORK.
DO YOU BUY THAT AT ALL?
>> NO, NO.
I MEAN, WE TOOK THAT THEORY

14:06.812 --> 14:14.320
APART, YOU KNOW, BIT BY BIT.
>> THIS DOESN'T PLAY OUT THE WAY
IT DOES BUT FOR A SPECIFIC TIP.
>> EXACTLY.

14:14.386 --> 14:20.292
>> WHO PROVIDED THAT TIP TO THE
NAZIS?
WHEN WE COME BACK, VINCE PANKOKE
AND THE COLD CASE TEAM NARROW

14:20.359 --> 14:27.266
DOWN THEIR LIST OF SUSPECTS.
AND FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME,
WE'LL REVEAL WHO THEY BELIEVE
BETRAYED THE FRANKS?

14:36.875 --> 14:40.913
30-YEAR
F.B.I. VETERAN, HAD WORKED
PLENTY OF COLD CASES, BUT NONE
THIS COLD.

14:40.980 --> 14:47.953
IT HAD BEEN MORE THAN SEVEN
DECADES SINCE ANNE FRANK AND HER
FAMILY HAD BEEN DISCOVERED IN
THEIR HIDING PLACE IN CENTRAL

14:48.020 --> 14:55.060
AMSTERDAM AND ULTIMATELY PUT ON
CATTLE CARS TO AUSCHWITZ.
AS TO THE QUESTION OF WHO
BETRAYED THE FAMILY TO THE

14:55.127 --> 15:00.766
NAZIS, ALL THE WITNESSES WERE
LONG DEAD, THEIR EVIDENCE
THINNED BY TIME.
BUT PANKOKE LEANED ON DECADES OF

15:00.833 --> 15:07.139
EXPERIENCE AND INTUITION,
STARTING WITH THE OLD CASE
FILES.
>> IN A NORMAL COLD CASE, YOU GO

15:07.206 --> 15:14.880
TO A FILE, YOU PULL IT OUT, YOU
READ THROUGH EVERYTHING THAT THE
PREVIOUS INVESTIGATION DID--
INTERVIEWS, LEADS THAT WERE

15:14.947 --> 15:20.619
FOLLOWED UP ON.
>> TWO PREVIOUS DUTCH POLICE
INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE RAID ON
ANNE FRANK'S HIDING PLACE, ONE

15:20.686 --> 15:28.427
IN 1948 AND ANOTHER IN 1963,
WERE NOT EXACTLY MASTER CLASSES
IN DETECTIVE WORK AND A LOT OF
TIME HAD PASSED.

15:28.494 --> 15:36.568
>> THE FILES WERE INCOMPLETE,
AND THEY WERE SCATTERED ABOUT IN
PROBABLY A DOZEN DIFFERENT
ARCHIVES.

15:36.635 --> 15:41.140
REPORTS WERE MISSING, WITNESSES
HAD PASSED ON, MEMORIES HAD
FAILED
>> PULLING FROM THE STANDARD

15:41.206 --> 15:46.045
COLD CASE PLAYBOOK, VINCE
PANKOKE FOLLOWED UP ON WHAT
LEADS HE COULD.
OTHERWISE, HE AND HIS TEAM HAD

15:46.111 --> 15:54.820
TO TAKE A FRESH APPROACH.
THEY SPENT YEARS IN PLACES LIKE
THE AMSTERDAM CITY ARCHIVES,
WHERE THE METICULOUS DUTCH

15:54.887 --> 16:00.826
RECORDKEEPING USED SO BRUTALLY
BY THE NAZIS PROVED A MAJOR
ASSET TO THE INVESTIGATION.
>> PEOPLE WERE FORCED TO WEAR

16:00.893 --> 16:07.866
THE STAR.
>> ALONG WITH PIETER VAN TWISK,
A VETERAN DUTCH JOURNALIST WHO
COFOUNDED THIS PROJECT AND LED

16:07.933 --> 16:14.673
THE RESEARCH TEAM, THEY SHOWED
US A TROVE OF ITEMS THEY DUG UP,
INCLUDING A RESIDENCE CARD
BELONGING TO ANNE FRANK.

16:14.740 --> 16:24.283
>> YOU CAN SEE HER, HER NAME,
HER FIRST NAME, HER SECOND NAME,
AND SURNAME, AND DATE OF BIRTH.
HERE YOU SEE AN "EYE" WHICH IS

16:24.350 --> 16:29.621
HER RELIGION.
>> AND ISRAELI.
JEWISH.
>> SHE WAS JEWISH, YES.

16:29.688 --> 16:34.393
>> EVERY DUTCH RESIDENT HAD TO
HAVE ONE OF THESE?
>> YES.
>> THIS IS VERY DETAILED AND

16:34.460 --> 16:42.267
THIS IS HER PARENTS' BIT, DATES
ON IT.
>> THAT IS ALL WHY IT WAS SO
EASY FOR NAZIS TO FIND PEOPLE IN

16:42.334 --> 16:48.073
THE NETHERLANDS AND KNOW WHO WAS
JEWISH AND WHO WAS NOT JEWISH.
>> ONE PIECE OF PAPER IN THE
40s, AND YOU HAVE EVERYTHING

16:48.140 --> 16:53.879
YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT SOMEONE.
>> YES.
>> THE TEAM FED EVERY MORSAL
THEY COULD-- LETTERS, MAPS,

16:53.946 --> 16:58.851
PHOTOS, EVEN WHOLE BOOKS-- INTO
THE ARTIFICIALLY INTELLIGENCE
DATABASE DEVELOPED SPECIFICALLY
FOR THE PROJECT.

16:58.917 --> 17:04.990
THEN THEY LET MACHINE LEARNING
DO ITS THING.
>> IT WOULD IDENTIFY
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PEOPLE,

17:05.057 --> 17:10.496
ADDRESSES THAT WERE ALIKE.
AND WE WERE LOOKING FOR THOSE
CONNECTIONS, CLUES TO SOLVING
THIS.

17:10.562 --> 17:15.601
>> QUANTIFY HOW MUCH TIME THAT
SAVED YOU.
>> OH, THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS
OF MANHOURS.

17:15.667 --> 17:23.175
>> THIS ALSO TELLS YOU WHAT'S
GARBAGE, WHAT'S EXCLUDED, WHAT
ISN'T GOING TO HELP YOUR CASE.
>> OH, YEAH, BECAUSE MUCH OF

17:23.242 --> 17:28.313
WHAT WE DO IS ELIMINATING THE
UNNECESSARY.
>> THE TEAM PAID PARTICULAR
ATTENTION TO ARREST RECORDS FROM

17:28.380 --> 17:36.355
THE TIME.
THE NAZIS WERE HELL . ON RIDDING
THE NETHERLANDS OF ALL JEWS,
PART OF THE FINAL SOLUTION.

17:36.422 --> 17:43.962
BY 1942, THE FRANKS REMEMBER
AMONG SOME 25,000 JEWS HIDING
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
THE NAZIS WERE SKILLED AT

17:44.029 --> 17:51.837
FETTING PEOPLE TO TALK.
>> THEIR TYPICAL M.O. WAS ONCE
THEY ARRESTED SOMEBODY THE FIRST
QUESTION THAT WAS POSED TO THEM,

17:51.904 --> 18:00.279
"DO YOU KNOW WHERE ANY OTHER
JEWS WERE IN HIDING?"
WE CHRONICLED ALL THE ARRESTS
PRIOR TO AND AFTER THE ANNEX

18:00.345 --> 18:07.686
RATE TO FIND ANY CONNECTION, ANY
LOOSE THREAD THAT WOULD SHOW US
THEY WENT FROM ONE ARREST TO
ANOTHER AND ULTIMATELY TO THE

18:07.753 --> 18:12.524
ANNEX.
>> AND THE IMPLICATION IS I'LL
MAKE YOUR SENTENCE MORE LENIENT
IF YOU GIVE UP SOME NAMES?

18:12.591 --> 18:18.530
>> YEAH.
>> EFFECTIVE?
>> OH, IT WAS VERY EFFECTIVE.
>> BEFORE LONG, SUSPECTS

18:18.597 --> 18:27.806
EMERGED, DOZENS OF THEM, LIKE
BILLAM VAN MERE, AN EMPLOYEE IN
THE WAREHOUSE WHERE THE FRANKS
WERE HIDING.

18:27.873 --> 18:33.946
>> HE WAS PRIME SUSPECT UNDER
ONE AFTER THE WAR.
HE'S WORKING DOWNSTAIRS IN THE
WAREHOUSE.

18:34.012 --> 18:42.688
HE WAS VERY SHIFTY, SUSPICIOUS,
ACTUALLY A THIEF.
>> SEEMS A SHIFTY, SUSPICIOUS
THIEF, AND YET YOU ELIMINATED

18:42.754 --> 18:49.728
HIM AS A SUSPECT.
>> NOT A BETRAR, THOUGH.
HE WAS NOT ANTI-SEMITIC.
HE HAD INCENTIVE NOT TO BETRAY

18:49.795 --> 18:53.765
THEM, BECAUSE IF HE DID, HE
WOULD HAVE LOST HIS JOB.
THE BUSINESS WOULD HAVE BEEN
CLOSED.

18:53.832 --> 18:59.238
>> WHAT SPECIFICALLY ARE YOU
LOOKING FOR WHEN YOU'RE
CONSIDERING SUSPECTS?
>> WE'RE LOOKING AT DID THEY

18:59.304 --> 19:05.611
HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE?
WE LOOK AT THEIR MOTIVE.
YOU KNOW, WHAT WOULD THE MOTIVE
BE?

19:05.677 --> 19:10.816
WERE THEY ANTI-SEMITIC?
WHERE THEY TRYING TO DO THIS FOR
MONEY?
AND OPPORTUNITY, WERE THEY EVEN

19:10.883 --> 19:21.660
IN TOWN?
>> THIS KNOWLEDGE, MOTIVE,
OPPORTUNITY, YOU'RE USING THAT
WHEN ENFIL TRAITING DRUG

19:21.727 --> 19:25.264
CARTELS?
>> IT'S STANDARD LAW ENFORCEMENT
TECHNIQUE.
>> WHAT KIND OF A PERSON WOULD

19:25.330 --> 19:35.908
BETRAY THE FRANK FAMILY?
>> I WOULD EXPECT MAYBE THAT A
VERY BAD PERSON, THAT THIS
PERSON WAS, SAY, PSYCHOPATHIC

19:35.974 --> 19:48.120
MIND, WOULD DO THIS.
>> VANDER MERE KNOWS
PSYCHOPATHIC MINESES.
HE HAD BEEN AN INVESTIGATIVE

19:48.186 --> 19:53.158
PSYCHOLOGIST.
ON VINCE PANKOKE'S TEAM, HE
ANALYZED THE BEHAVIOR OF
SUSPECTS THEY WERE CONSIDERING.

19:53.225 --> 19:59.364
THAT'S YOUR FIRST INSTINCT, IT
IT HAD TO BE A PSYCHOPATH TO DO
THIS?
>> YES, BUT YOU HAVE TO BE SO

19:59.431 --> 20:05.070
VERY CAREFUL.
IT'S SURVIVING.
YOUR DAY-TO-DAY LIFE IS FILLED
WITH FEAR.

20:05.137 --> 20:09.474
YOUR FAMILY MIGHT BE ARRESTED
THE NEXT DAY.
YOU'RE THINKING EVERY DAY ABOUT
YOUR OWN SURVIVAL.

20:09.541 --> 20:18.016
SO THAT'S THE CONTEXT.
>> IN A VACUUM, IT HAD TO BE A
PSYCHOPATH TO DO THIS, BUT GIVEN
THE CONTEXT, THEN WHAT KIND OF

20:18.083 --> 20:24.056
PERSON MIGHT DO THIS?
>> THEN YOU END UP IN A
SITUATION WHERE IT COULD BE
ANYBODY.

20:24.122 --> 20:31.163
>> OVER TIME THE FOCUS SHIFTED
TO SOMEONE WHO ON THE SURFACE
MIGHT NOT HAVE RAISED SUSPICION.
THIS SUSPECT WAS A NEIGHBOR OF

20:31.229 --> 20:43.008
THE FRANKS AND DID WORK FOR
THEM, BUT THE F.B.I.'S MAN'S
SIXTH SENSE KICKED IN.
A BUSINESS MAN WITH A WIFE AND,

20:43.075 --> 20:49.314
AND HE SERVED ON A COUNCIL THE
NAZIS SET UP TO CARRY OUT THEIR
POLICIES WITHIN THE JEWISH
COMMUNITY.

20:49.381 --> 20:55.220
IN EXCHANGE FOR DOING THE NAZI'S
BIDDING, MEMBERS MIGHT BE SPARED
THE GAS CHAMBERS.
>> WE KNOW FROM HISTORY, THAT

20:55.287 --> 21:05.130
THE JEWISH COUNCIL WAS DISSOLVED
IN LATE SEPTEMBER OF 1943.
AND THEY WERE SENT TO THE CAMPS.
WE FIGURED, WELL, IF ARNOLD

21:05.197 --> 21:11.870
VANDENBERG IS IN A CAMP
SOMEWHERE, HE CERTAINLY CAN'T BE
PRIVY TO INFORMATION THAT WOULD
LEAD TO THE COMPROMISE OF THE

21:11.937 --> 21:18.176
ANNEX.
>> WAS HE IN A CAMP SOMEWHERE?
>> WELL, WE THOUGHT HE WAS.
SO DUE DILIGENCE, WE STARTED TO

21:18.243 --> 21:25.484
SEARCH, AND WE COULDN'T FIND
ARNOLD VANDENBERG OR ANY OF HIS
IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS IN
THOSE CAMPS.

21:25.550 --> 21:30.856
>> WHY NOT?
>> WELL, THAT WAS THE QUESTION.
IF HE WASN'T IN THE CAMPS, WHERE
WAS HE?

21:30.922 --> 21:38.830
>> TURNED OUT, HE WAS LIVING IN
OPEN LIFE IN THE MIDDLE OF
AMSTERDAM, VINCE PANKOKE SAYS.
ONLY POSSIBLE IF VANDENBERG HAD

21:38.897 --> 21:44.903
SOME KIND OF LEVERAGE.
TO MY EARS, YOU'RE DESCRIBING AN
OPERATOR.
IS THAT FAIR?

21:44.970 --> 21:54.746
>> I CALL HIM A CHESS PLAYER.
HE THOUGHT IN TERMS OF LAYERS OF
PROTECTION, BY OBTAINING
DIFFERENT EXEMPTIONS FROM BEING

21:54.813 --> 22:03.088
PLACED INTO CAMPS.
>> AS IT HAPPENED, VANDENBERG,
WHO DIED IN 1950, HAD COME UP
BEFORE IN A REPORT FROM THE 1963

22:03.155 --> 22:10.696
INVESTIGATION, THOUGH,
ASTONISHINGLY, THERE WAS LITTLE
APPARENT FOLLOW-UP BY POLICE.
>> WE READ JUST ONE SMALL

22:10.762 --> 22:18.470
PARAGRAPH THAT MENTIONED DURING
THE INTERVIEW OF OTTO FRANK, HE
TOLD THEM THAT SHORTLY AFTER
LIBERATION, HE RECEIVED AN

22:18.537 --> 22:28.647
ANONYMOUS NOTE IDENTIFYING HIS
BETRAR OF THE ADDRESS WHERE THEY
WERE STAYING, THE ANNEX, AS
ARNOLD VANDENBERG.

22:28.714 --> 22:33.985
>> WAIT, SO IN THE FILE WAS
REFERENCE TO A NOTE THAT OTTO
FRANK RECEIVED THAT MENTIONS
THIS SPECIFIC NAME?

22:34.052 --> 22:40.092
>> REMARKABLY SO, YES.
IT'S LISTED RIGHT THERE.
>> THE NOTE WAS SO STRIKING TO
OTTO FRANK, THAT HE TYPED UP A

22:40.158 --> 22:47.065
COPY FOR HIS RECORDS.
NATURALLY, THE VETERAN F.B.I.
MAN WANTED TO KNOW WHERE WAS
THAT NOTE?

22:47.132 --> 22:53.105
ANY SEASONED INVESTIGATOR WILL
TELL YOU THAT IDEALLY, GOOD SHOE
LEATHER COMES GARNISHED WITH
GOOD LUCK.

22:53.171 --> 22:59.311
IN 2018, THE TEAM LOCATED THE
SON OF ONE OF THE FORMER
INVESTIGATORS.
THERE, IN THE SON'S HOME, BURIED

22:59.377 --> 23:05.417
IN SOME OLD FILES, OTTO'S COPY
OF THE NOTE.
>> I JUST WANT TO GET THIS
STRAIGHT-- YOU'RE TALKING TO THE

23:05.484 --> 23:10.822
SON OF AN INVESTIGATOR.
HE SAYS, "YEAH, 50 YEARS AGO, MY
DAD LOOKED INTO THIS, AND I
MIGHT HAVE SOME MATERIAL."

23:10.889 --> 23:17.095
>> YEAH.
WE WERE LUCKY.
>> YOU'VE HELD THE METAPHORICAL
SMOKING GUN IN YOUR HAND BEFORE

23:17.162 --> 23:21.767
IN THE F.B.I.
YOU'RE HANDLING THIS ANONYMOUS
NOTE.
DOES IT FEEL LIKE A SMOKING GUN?

23:21.833 --> 23:28.573
>> NOT A SMOKING GUN, BUT IT
FEELS LIKE A WARM GUN WITH THE
EVIDENCE OF THE BULLETS SITTING
NEARBY.

23:28.640 --> 23:35.814
>> BACK AT THE ARCHIVES THEY
SHOWED IT TO US, OTTO'S COPY.
THE TEAM USED FORENSIC
TECHNIQUES WHICH THEY SAY

23:35.881 --> 23:41.853
AUTHENTICATES IT.
THAT HANDWRITING YOU SEE?
THE SCRIBBLINGS OF THE 1963
DETECTIVE.

23:41.920 --> 23:51.863
THE ANONYMOUS NOTE INFORMED OTTO
THAT HE HAD BEEN BETRAYED BY
ARNOLD VANDENBERG WHO HANDED THE
NAUGHTIES AN ENTIRE LIST OF

23:51.930 --> 23:58.336
ADDRESSES WITH JEWS WERE HIDING.
>> WHOEVER AUTHORED THIS
ANONYMOUS NOTE KNEW SO MUCH,
LISTS TURNED IN.

23:58.403 --> 24:04.209
>> THIS WAS INFORMATION YOU WERE
ABLE TO CORROBORATE.
>> PETER WAS ABLE TO LOCATE IN
THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES RECORDS

24:04.276 --> 24:12.017
THAT INDICATED THAT IN FACT
SOMEBODY FROM THE JEWISH
COUNCIL, OF WHICH ARNOLD
VANDENBERG WAS A MEMBER, WAS

24:12.083 --> 24:18.256
TURNING OVER LISTS OF ADDRESSES
WHERE JEWS WERE IN HIDING.
>> WHAT'S YOUR THEORY OF THE
CASE HERE?

24:18.323 --> 24:24.696
HOW AND WHY WOULD ARNOLD
VANDENBERG HAVE BETRAYED THE
FRANK FAMILY?
>> WELL, IN HIS ROLE AS BEING A

24:24.763 --> 24:32.370
FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE JEWISH
COUNCIL, HE WOULD HAVE HAD PRIVY
TO ADDRESSES WHERE JEWS WERE
HIDING.

24:32.437 --> 24:40.445
WHEN VANDENBERG LOST ALL HIS
SERIES OF PROTECTIONS, EXEMPTING
HIM FROM HAVING TO GO TO THE
CAMPS, HE HAD TO PROVIDE

24:40.512 --> 24:48.653
SOMETHING VALUABLE TO THE NAZIS
THAT HE'S HAD CONTACT WITH,s
TO LET HIM, AND HIS WIFE AT THAT
TIME, STAY SAFE.

24:48.720 --> 24:56.294
>> IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE HE KNEW
WHO HE WAS GIVING UP?
>> THERE'S NO EVIDENCE TO
INDICATE THAT HE KNEW WHO WAS

24:56.361 --> 25:02.901
HIDING AT ANY OF THESE
ADDRESSES.
THEY WERE JUST ADDRESSES THAT
WERE PROVIDED WHERE JEWS WERE

25:02.968 --> 25:09.908
KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN IN HIDING.
>> WE CONTACTED THE FOUNDATION
OTTO FRANK STARTED IN
SWITZERLAND AND THE ANNE FRANK

25:09.975 --> 25:14.913
HOUSE IN AMSTERDAM, NEITHER OF
WHICH FORMALLY PARTICIPATED IN
THE INVESTIGATION, TO TRY TO
FIND OUT WHETHER THEY COULD

25:14.980 --> 25:21.319
PROVIDE ANY OTHER EVIDENCE THAT
MIGHT IMPLICATE OR CLEAR ARNOLD
VANDENBERG.
THE ANNE FRANK HOUSE SAID THEY

25:21.386 --> 25:25.891
COULD NOT.
THE FOUNDATION IS RESERVING
COMMENT UNTIL THEY'VE SEEN THE
ENTIRE RESULTS OF THE

25:25.957 --> 25:32.964
INVESTIGATION.
THE COLD CASE TEAM BEGAN TO
CONFRONT THE REAL POSSIBILITY
THAT OTTO FRANK MIGHT HAVE KNOWN

25:33.031 --> 25:39.337
THE IDENTITY OF THE BETRAYER.
WHAT REASON, THEY WONDERED, WHAT
OTTO HAVE HAD TO KEEP THIS TO
HIMSELF?

25:39.404 --> 25:47.178
>> HE KNEW THAT ARNOLD
VANDENBERG WAS JEWISH, AND IN
THIS PERIOD AFTER THE WAR,
ANTI-SEMITISM WAS STILL AROUND.

25:47.245 --> 25:54.986
SO PERHAPS HE JUST FELT THAT "IF
I BRING THIS UP AGAIN WITH
ARNOLD VANDENBERG BEING JEWISH,
IT WILL ONLY STOKE THE FIRES

25:55.053 --> 26:02.694
FURTHER."
BUT WEHAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT
THE FACT THAT HE WAS JEWISH JUST
MEANT THAT HE WAS PLACED INTO AN

26:02.761 --> 26:08.266
UNTENABLE POSITION BY THE NAZIS
TO DO SOMETHING TO SAVE HIS
LIFE.
>> THE TEAM WRESTLED WITH THESE

26:08.333 --> 26:15.740
ETHICAL QUESTIONS.
THE FILMMAKER AND DOCUMENTARIAN
WHO COCEIVED OF THE PROJECT,
WONDERED WHETHER THE REVELATION

26:15.807 --> 26:23.581
WOULD BE FODDER FOR BIGOTS AND
ANTI-SEMMITES.
THE CONCLUSION WAS THIS CULPRIT
WAS A JEWISH MAN WHO BY ALL

26:23.648 --> 26:28.920
ACCOUNTS WAS WAS DOING WHAT HE
DID TO PROTECT HIS OWN FAMILY.
WHAT WAS YOUR EMOTION WHEN YOU
HEARD THIS?

26:28.987 --> 26:34.025
>> I FOUND IT VERY PAINFUL.
MAYBE OU CAN EVEN SAY I HOPED
IT WOULDN'T BE SOMETHING LIKE
THIS.

26:34.092 --> 26:40.432
>> WHY?
>> BECAUSE I FEEL THE PAIN OF
ALL THESE PEOPLE BEING PUT IN--
IN A SITUATION WHICH IS VERY

26:40.498 --> 26:46.705
HARD FOR US TO UNDERSTAND.
>> I SUSPECT WHEN THIS IS
REVEALED, PEOPLE AROUND THE
WORLD ARE GOING TO BE

26:46.771 --> 26:52.444
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE IDEA THAT
A JEW BETRAYED ANOTHER JEW.
>> I HOPE SO.
>> YOU HOPE THEY WILL BE.

26:52.510 --> 26:57.682
>> YES.
>> BECAUSE IT SHOWS YOU HOW
BIZARRE THE NAZI REGIME REALLY
OPERATED AND HOW THEY BROUGHT

26:57.749 --> 27:03.989
PEOPLE TO DO THESE TERRIBLE
THINGS.
THE REAL QUESTION IS WHAT WOULD
I HAVE DONE?

27:04.055 --> 27:12.697
THAT'S THE REAL QUESTION.
ERPT.
>> THROUGHOUT THE PROJECT, HE
SOUGHT COUNCIL FROM AN ORTHODOX

27:12.764 --> 27:21.172
RABBI IN AMSTERDAM WHO SERVED AS
CHIEF JEWISH CHAPLAIN IN THE
DUTCH ARMY.
IS A GREATER GOOD BEING SERVED

27:21.239 --> 27:24.843
HERE?
I HOPE SO.
I TRULY HOPE SO.
I HOPE THAT PEOPLE WILL

27:24.909 --> 27:37.322
UNDERSTAND THAT ONE OF THE
THINGS THAT THE NAZI IDEOLOGY
DID DURING THE HOLOCAUST WAS TO
DEHUMANIZE JEWISH PEOPLE.

27:37.389 --> 27:46.031
AND GOING BACK INTO HISTORY AND
LOOKING FOR THE TRUTH AND ATANG
TRUTH IS ACTUALLY GIVING THE
JEWISH PEOPLE BACK THEIR OWN

27:46.097 --> 27:52.737
HUMANITY.
EVEN IF THAT MEANS THAT
SOMETIMES JEWISH PEOPLE ARE SEEN
AS NOT ACTING MORALLY CORRECT,

27:52.804 --> 27:59.044
THAT GIVES THEM BACK THEIR OWN
HUMANITY BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY
HUMAN BEINGS ARE WHEN THEY'RE
FACED WITH EXISTENTIAL THREATS.

27:59.110 --> 28:06.284
>> AFTER HIS YEARS OF
INVESTIGATING THIS
SEVEN-DECADE-OLD COLD CASE, WE
HAD A HYPOTHETICAL FOR VINCE

28:06.351 --> 28:09.821
PANKOKE.
YOU'RE BACK TO BEING AN F.B.I.
AGENT.
YOU'VE GOT THIS CASE YOU'VE

28:09.888 --> 28:13.958
BUILT.
YOU'VE GOT YOUR EVIDENCE.
AND YOU HANDED OVER TO THE
PROSECUTOR, THE U.S. ATTORNEY.

28:14.025 --> 28:18.396
YOU THINK YOU'RE GETTING A
CONVICTION?
>> NO.
THERE COULD BE SOME REASONABLE

28:18.463 --> 28:22.634
DOUBT.
>> TO BE CLEAR, IT'S A
CIRCUMSTANTIAL CASE.
>> IT IS A CIRCUMSTANTIAL CASE,

28:22.700 --> 28:30.341
AS MANY CASES ARE.
IN TODAY'S CRIME SOLVING THEY
WANT POSITIVE D.N.A. EVIDENCE OR
VIDEO SURVEILLANCE TAPE.

28:30.408 --> 28:39.818
WE CAN'T GIVE YOU ANY OF THAT.
BUT IN A HISTORICAL CASE THIS
OLD WITH ALL THE EVIDENCE THAT
WE OBTAINED, I THINK IT'S PRETTY

28:39.884 --> 28:46.257
CONVINCING.
>> NOW BACK IN RETIREMENT, VINCE
PANKOKE THINKS HE'S GLIMPSED A
NEW WAY TO THAW COLD CASES.

28:46.324 --> 28:53.731
HE MARVELS THAT AN INVESTIGATION
THAT PUT NO ONE BEHIND BARS
TURNED OUT TO BE THE MOST
SIGNIFICANT CASE OF HIS CAREER.

28:53.798 --> 28:59.637
AND ONE, HE BELIEVES, THAT
BROUGHT AN ANSWER TO A PAINFUL
HISTORICAL QUESTION.
