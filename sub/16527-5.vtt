No.

Patience is the key.

05:49.566 --> 05:52.170
So, uh, what kind of treatment
was Jackson getting here?

05:52.170 --> 05:53.740

05:58.750 --> 06:00.521
Uh, just anti‐depressants.

06:00.521 --> 06:01.790
Anti‐depressants

06:01.790 --> 06:02.825

06:20.861 --> 06:22.865
In your sessions, did
Jackson ever say anything

06:22.865 --> 06:25.236
that may explain what happened?

06:25.236 --> 06:26.606
Not really.

06:26.606 --> 06:28.844
Jackson was a good guy.

06:28.844 --> 06:30.246
He got along with the others.

06:30.246 --> 06:32.250
Funny.

06:32.250 --> 06:34.522
But with anyone who's been
through what Jackson has,

06:34.522 --> 06:38.597
there's always the worry
that he might... break.

06:38.597 --> 06:39.599
Break?

06:39.599 --> 06:42.137
You mind unpacking

06:42.137 --> 06:44.742
that psychiatric
term for us there, doc?

06:44.742 --> 06:47.280
Jackson's trained with the best.

06:47.280 --> 06:49.886

people can't even imagine.

06:49.886 --> 06:52.023
If he's out there,
without any counseling,

06:52.023 --> 06:54.161

<i>that could be a very</i>
<i>dangerous scenario.</i>

of the lucky ones.

07:51.074 --> 07:53.112
Something like that.

07:53.112 --> 07:54.882
You know, I was going
through Jackson's file,

07:54.882 --> 07:57.688
and I saw that he served
overseas for eight years.

07:57.688 --> 07:59.224
How long were you there?

07:59.224 --> 08:01.763
It's not really
a competition, Rog.

08:01.763 --> 08:05.036
So, he served more
time than you.

08:05.036 --> 08:07.340
Look, I couldn't tell if Dr. Cox

08:07.340 --> 08:09.979
was talking about Jackson
or you back there.

08:11.181 --> 08:13.085
Is there anything else
you can tell me

08:13.085 --> 08:14.956

we're trying to arrest?

08:14.956 --> 08:16.926

08:16.926 --> 08:18.362

08:18.362 --> 08:20.868
I mean, it certainly

08:20.868 --> 08:21.836

08:21.836 --> 08:23.072

19:31.908 --> 19:33.612
but most of the patients
who take part

19:33.612 --> 19:34.948
in these trials are broken.

19:34.948 --> 19:37.285
Long before they take
the medication.

19:37.285 --> 19:40.225
They're beyond our scope.

19:41.695 --> 19:43.632
Ms. Swinton, could you
provide us with a list

19:43.632 --> 19:45.903
of the other patients
involved in this trial?

19:45.903 --> 19:48.709
We'd like to talk to them.

19:48.709 --> 19:51.948
Please. Chad Jackson
is still out there.

19:51.948 --> 19:53.852
We're just trying to help him.

19:53.852 --> 19:55.956
Dr. Logan Cox

19:55.956 --> 19:57.693
provided us the subjects
for our testing.

19:57.693 --> 19:59.797
Dr. Cox from the V. A. hospital?

19:59.797 --> 20:02.435
Yes. He administered
the medication

20:02.435 --> 20:04.540
to the patients
in his group therapy.

20:04.540 --> 20:06.678
RIGGS:
<i>Dr. Cox said he only prescribed</i>

20:06.678 --> 20:08.815
anti‐depressants to Jackson.

20:08.815 --> 20:10.719
He failed to mention the trials.

20:10.719 --> 20:11.888
Lied to our faces.

20:11.888 --> 20:13.759
Yeah, well.

20:13.759 --> 20:15.829
I grabbed one of the Doctor's
business cards for you.

20:15.829 --> 20:17.566
Saw how you guys got along.

20:17.566 --> 20:20.104
Figured he'd be someone
you can open up to.

20:20.104 --> 20:21.106
(beeps)

20:21.106 --> 20:23.044
(phone ringing)

20:26.050 --> 20:27.586
SCORSESE:
Hello?

20:27.586 --> 20:29.657
Yeah,
it's Detective Murtaugh, LAPD.

20:29.657 --> 20:31.594
Is Dr. Cox available?

20:31.594 --> 20:33.899
Can't come to the phone.

20:33.899 --> 20:36.771
He's a little... dead right now.

20:36.771 --> 20:38.007
♪ ♪

20:41.948 --> 20:43.184
SCORSESE:
Dr. Cox was shot

20:43.184 --> 20:44.754
in the back of his head,
at close range

20:44.754 --> 20:46.624
while walking to his car.

20:46.624 --> 20:48.528
9mm shell casing was
recovered at the scene,

20:48.528 --> 20:49.664
consistent with the injury.

20:49.664 --> 20:51.200
Fingerprints?

20:51.200 --> 20:53.505
SCORSESE: Yep. Found a bunch
of prints at the scene.

20:53.505 --> 20:54.741
All match Chad Jackson.

20:54.741 --> 20:56.243
AVERY: Thank you, Scorsese,
I think I've heard

20:56.243 --> 20:58.014
everything I need to...
MURTAUGH: Anyone else
having a hard time buying

20:58.014 --> 21:00.652
that a sniper shot
him at close range?

21:00.652 --> 21:02.823
And in the back of the head?

21:06.463 --> 21:08.467
Come on, Jackson would've
looked him in the eye

21:08.467 --> 21:09.971
and shot him in the face
like a gentleman.

21:09.971 --> 21:12.843
Do we need Scorsese
to repeat the evidence?

21:12.843 --> 21:15.014
AVERY: His prints
were found at the scene.

21:15.014 --> 21:17.753
Jackson is still out there.
He's unhinged

21:17.753 --> 21:19.791
and dangerous. We need
to go public on this now.

21:19.791 --> 21:22.495
MURTAUGH: I wouldn't do that!
I know <i>you</i> wouldn't do that.

21:22.495 --> 21:24.132
You wouldn't also bother
to change your shirt

21:24.132 --> 21:26.136
every‐‐ I don't know‐‐ week,
but neither of these things

21:26.136 --> 21:27.238
are decisions you're making.

21:27.238 --> 21:30.478
Most of the vets in Jackson's
group therapy are dead.

21:30.478 --> 21:32.182
All right? Now, that's
either a big coincidence,

21:32.182 --> 21:34.052
or this thing's bigger
than it seems.

21:34.052 --> 21:36.090
We need more to go on
than that, Riggs.

21:36.090 --> 21:37.526
I didn't want this

21:37.526 --> 21:38.829
to escalate to
murder, but it has

21:38.829 --> 21:40.799
and it's our responsibility
to ensure the safety

21:40.799 --> 21:41.901
of the public,
so this doesn't get worse.

21:41.901 --> 21:43.772
And you think smoking
him out with a press release

21:43.772 --> 21:45.041
is gonna do that?

21:46.544 --> 21:47.680
Silent partner.

21:47.680 --> 21:49.851
What do you think?

21:54.594 --> 21:56.230
I think you're
too close to this.

21:56.230 --> 21:58.568
We need to find Jackson.

21:58.568 --> 22:01.240
If he's innocent, then he can
prove that when he's in custody.

22:01.240 --> 22:02.877
Thank you.

22:04.881 --> 22:05.816
Thanks, partner.

22:09.757 --> 22:11.528
AVERY:
<i>Good morning.</i>

22:11.528 --> 22:13.765
Last night,
Dr. Logan Cox was murdered,

22:13.765 --> 22:15.067
leaving work
at the Veteran's Hospital.

22:15.067 --> 22:17.205
And although this is
an ongoing investigation,

22:17.205 --> 22:20.546
the suspect in this case,
Chad Jackson, remains at large.

22:20.546 --> 22:22.850
The Los Angeles Police
Department would like to ask

22:22.850 --> 22:24.219
the community
for any information

22:24.219 --> 22:25.856
that might be helpful
in Mr. Jackson's apprehension.

22:25.856 --> 22:27.091
(phones ringing)

22:27.091 --> 22:29.830
Yes, ma'am. Every detail helps.

22:29.830 --> 22:31.568
I agree,
he is attractive.

22:31.568 --> 22:34.840
So, you seen the suspect on the
sidelines of the Rams game, huh?

22:34.840 --> 22:36.744
(indistinct conversation)

22:39.717 --> 22:40.953
Littering in the park.

22:40.953 --> 22:41.888
Milk cartons, was it?

22:41.888 --> 22:43.758
Yes, sir, I'll be sure
to add that to the...

22:43.758 --> 22:44.860
Hey, hey, hey.
Give me that.

22:44.860 --> 22:47.131
Where exactly did you find

22:47.131 --> 22:49.870
this man littering milk cartons?

22:49.870 --> 22:51.006
Get me Riggs.

22:59.289 --> 23:01.995
MURTAUGH:
Maybe you're just
at one with nature

23:01.995 --> 23:04.266
or being your usual
brooding self,

23:04.266 --> 23:05.602
but you haven't
said a word

23:05.602 --> 23:06.838
to me since we
left the car.

23:06.838 --> 23:07.973
I'm being stealthy, Rog.

23:07.973 --> 23:08.975
Why don't you
give it a shot?

23:08.975 --> 23:10.111
Hey, look, I'm sorry

23:10.111 --> 23:11.614
I took Avery's side back there,

23:11.614 --> 23:13.117
but it doesn't change
the fact that I'm out here

23:13.117 --> 23:14.854
sweating bullets with you.

23:14.854 --> 23:16.991
You are sweating a lot.

23:16.991 --> 23:17.993
Why don't you hang back?

23:17.993 --> 23:18.995
Take a break.

23:18.995 --> 23:20.264
Oh, no, no, I'm fine.

23:20.264 --> 23:22.168
Just tell me if you see
a water fountain,

23:22.168 --> 23:24.306
or a misting tent,
or something.

23:24.306 --> 23:25.842
RIGGS:
This way.

23:25.842 --> 23:27.780
MURTAUGH:
Navy SEAL's instinct
kicking in?

23:27.780 --> 23:29.750
No, my granddaddy
taught me how to hunt.

23:29.750 --> 23:33.157
When I was a kid I'd
track deer, elk, possum.

23:33.157 --> 23:34.727
Possum?

23:34.727 --> 23:35.996
Marinate it
in some teriyaki

23:35.996 --> 23:37.298
with some rice and
beans on the side.

23:37.298 --> 23:39.035
(laughs)
That's so country.

23:39.035 --> 23:40.071
Teriyaki possum

23:40.071 --> 23:41.908
with coon pie.

23:41.908 --> 23:43.778
Uh‐oh.
Hunter instinct?

23:43.778 --> 23:45.014
RIGGS: No.

23:47.953 --> 23:49.322
I think we just walked

23:49.322 --> 23:50.926
into Jackson's kill zone.

23:50.926 --> 23:52.930
His kill zone?!
Shh.

23:52.930 --> 23:55.234
We're probably
in his crosshairs right now.

23:55.234 --> 23:56.103
Okay.

23:56.103 --> 23:58.073
I know you're
Mr. Crazy Under Fire,

23:58.073 --> 24:00.679
but I need a little
heads up on kill zones.

24:00.679 --> 24:02.750
Is there a DMZ
around here somewhere?

24:02.750 --> 24:04.285
Hey, hey, hey.
Stand down.

24:04.285 --> 24:05.889
(whispering):
I'm serious.

24:05.889 --> 24:07.258
If Jackson thinks we're
here to arrest him,

24:07.258 --> 24:08.862
he will kill us.

24:08.862 --> 24:10.999
(whispering):
We are here
to arrest him.

24:10.999 --> 24:12.903
All right, well, let that
be our little secret.

24:12.903 --> 24:13.905
Go that way.

24:13.905 --> 24:16.143
Trust me.

24:20.886 --> 24:22.188
Hey, Jackson!

24:22.188 --> 24:23.892
Sorry to barge in unannounced.

24:25.361 --> 24:27.198
Look, I'm not here
to arrest you.

24:27.198 --> 24:29.770
(distantly):
I just want to talk.

24:31.674 --> 24:34.680
Man, I used to hate
sniper overwatch.

24:34.680 --> 24:35.916
I mean, at first it's all right.

24:35.916 --> 24:37.218
You know, you're out
in the woods.

24:37.218 --> 24:38.822
It's quiet.

24:38.822 --> 24:40.257
Just you and your spotter.

24:41.694 --> 24:43.665
Then you realize
you can't move,

24:43.665 --> 24:45.267
can't take a leak,
can't talk.

24:45.267 --> 24:48.273
Just sitting there, waiting.

24:48.273 --> 24:50.110
Staring through the optics.

24:53.250 --> 24:55.989
Then the silence
becomes deafening.

24:58.862 --> 25:01.767
Nothing to say,
no one to say it to.

25:04.339 --> 25:05.675
Here I am, just listening

25:05.675 --> 25:07.679
to the trees again.

25:09.817 --> 25:11.821
JACKSON (distantly):
I didn't kill Dr. Cox.

25:15.962 --> 25:17.866
A lot of people think you did.

25:17.866 --> 25:20.371
You having trouble making up
your own mind?

25:20.371 --> 25:23.978
Yeah, well, you had
your motivation.

25:23.978 --> 25:26.884
Dr. Cox poisoned you, trying to
feed you those pills every day.

25:26.884 --> 25:28.755
And your fingerprints
were at the scene, so...

25:28.755 --> 25:30.124
Yeah, I was there.

25:32.028 --> 25:33.898
I tried to get him to admit
what he'd done.

25:33.898 --> 25:36.036
But he was alive when I left.

25:37.138 --> 25:39.375
Somebody else silenced him

25:39.375 --> 25:41.146
before the truth could come out.

25:41.146 --> 25:42.883
Now it's up to me to find out

25:42.883 --> 25:44.419
who was behind it all
and stop them.

25:44.419 --> 25:45.722
Stop who?

25:50.297 --> 25:53.170
You know, I can tell you,
you look pretty damn calm

25:53.170 --> 25:56.042
for a man with a rifle
pointed at him.

25:56.042 --> 25:58.013
It's not my first time.

26:00.451 --> 26:02.723
Hey, Jackson, why don't you
let me take you in?

26:02.723 --> 26:04.392
No.

26:04.392 --> 26:07.131
I told you,
not till I finish my mission.

26:07.131 --> 26:09.737
Right, right, your mission.

26:09.737 --> 26:11.406
You did mention that.

26:11.406 --> 26:14.312
How about we finish
the mission together?

26:14.312 --> 26:16.884
Sorry, I don't need
a spotter on this one.

26:18.186 --> 26:19.790
Oh, your partner
on the other hand...

26:19.790 --> 26:22.663
(distantly):
you got his six?

26:23.765 --> 26:25.669
(metal clicks)

26:29.777 --> 26:31.312
Riggs!

26:33.083 --> 26:35.187
Riggs!

26:35.187 --> 26:37.091
Rog!
(Murtaugh shouts)

26:37.091 --> 26:38.360
Look. What is this?!

26:38.360 --> 26:40.197
Okay, don't move.

26:40.197 --> 26:42.068
Don't move.
Don't move.

26:44.840 --> 26:46.176
RIGGS:
You stepped
into a trip wire

26:46.176 --> 26:47.211
connected to an IED.

26:47.211 --> 26:48.948
Call bomb squad.

26:48.948 --> 26:50.384
No, there's no time for that.

26:50.384 --> 26:51.821
No ti...

26:51.821 --> 26:53.958
No... no, I‐I can't die
like this.

26:53.958 --> 26:56.229
Okay, there might be
another way out.

26:56.229 --> 26:57.933
"Might be"?!

26:57.933 --> 26:59.001
Look, tell my family
I love them.

26:59.001 --> 27:00.805
And, hey, I need
you to tell

27:00.805 --> 27:02.943
Trish something
for me, okay?

27:02.943 --> 27:06.049
Tell her my dying words:
she cannot remarry.

27:06.049 --> 27:06.984
She has to die alone.

27:06.984 --> 27:08.955
And tell her that she
has to fire Desmond.

27:08.955 --> 27:10.190
Wait, don't tell her now.

27:10.190 --> 27:11.192
Wait till I'm dead!

27:11.192 --> 27:13.196
Where you going?!

27:13.196 --> 27:15.067
What are you doing?!

27:15.067 --> 27:16.336
What are you... what are you,
what are you, what are you...

27:16.336 --> 27:17.773
Oh, no! No!

27:23.083 --> 27:24.920
(coughs)

27:27.091 --> 27:28.226
Who's Desmond?

27:28.226 --> 27:29.797
(groans)

27:33.203 --> 27:35.140
(basketball bouncing)

27:49.335 --> 27:51.941
I didn't hear you
come in last night.

27:51.941 --> 27:54.145
You all right?

27:54.145 --> 27:56.416
I almost died yesterday.

27:56.416 --> 27:58.521
Die... what?
I mean, I'm fine.

27:58.521 --> 27:59.857
I didn't, but...

27:59.857 --> 28:01.827
it was just...

28:01.827 --> 28:03.798
I made a mistake.

28:03.798 --> 28:05.902
I wasn't as focused as
I usually am out there.

28:05.902 --> 28:08.440
(breathes heavily)

28:08.440 --> 28:09.810
Baby.

28:09.810 --> 28:11.045
Hmm?

28:11.045 --> 28:13.049
Have I lost a step?

28:13.049 --> 28:15.087
What are you talking
about, Roger?

28:15.087 --> 28:16.857
Our daughter.
She let me win

28:16.857 --> 28:18.828
that game yesterday.
She pitied me.

28:18.828 --> 28:20.999
And then the other day,
with, uh... Denzel...

28:20.999 --> 28:22.101
Desmond.
Yeah, right.

28:22.101 --> 28:23.103
(laughs)

28:23.103 --> 28:25.107
You know,
a couple years ago,

28:25.107 --> 28:26.442
I would've
rolled with it.

28:26.442 --> 28:28.113
You know, made fun of him

28:28.113 --> 28:29.549
just to let him know
who's the boss, but...

28:29.549 --> 28:31.854
but he really got me
off my game.

28:31.854 --> 28:33.456
Being all young and...

28:33.456 --> 28:34.526
And stupid.
Yeah, right.

28:34.526 --> 28:35.595
(laughs)

28:35.595 --> 28:36.997
Do you realize how many

28:36.997 --> 28:38.834
mistakes he made before lunch?

28:38.834 --> 28:40.370
Experience trumps youth

28:40.370 --> 28:42.408
(laughs)
every day
of the week.

28:42.408 --> 28:44.412
Tell that to my knees.
(laughs)

28:45.515 --> 28:47.484
Oh, Trish.

28:50.157 --> 28:52.227
Ever since the heart attack,

28:52.227 --> 28:54.833
I just haven't felt
like I can bounce back.

28:56.537 --> 28:57.572
The other day,

28:57.572 --> 28:59.041
chasing after a guy.

28:59.041 --> 29:00.177
He jumps off a building.

29:00.177 --> 29:01.880
How am I supposed to keep up

29:01.880 --> 29:03.283
with guys that jump off
buildings?

29:03.283 --> 29:04.953
Listen to me.

29:04.953 --> 29:07.191
Wise men don't
jump off buildings.

29:08.460 --> 29:10.565
And, baby...

29:10.565 --> 29:12.869
you're a very wise man.

29:15.975 --> 29:19.883
(laughing)

29:19.883 --> 29:23.256
The entire bomb squad
is searching Griffith Park

29:23.256 --> 29:24.626
for more booby traps.

29:24.626 --> 29:26.462
They had to close the park.

29:26.462 --> 29:28.466
The last time that happened
was 50 years ago,

29:28.466 --> 29:30.303
when the animals escaped
the L. A. Zoo.

29:30.303 --> 29:31.573
Well, I hope
they found them all.

29:31.573 --> 29:33.309
I mean, the bombs,

29:33.309 --> 29:34.613
not the koalas
or orangutans.
This is not funny, Riggs.

29:34.613 --> 29:35.948
You should've called for backup

29:35.948 --> 29:37.184
the second you knew
Jackson was there.

29:37.184 --> 29:37.986
And how do you
think he'd respond

29:37.986 --> 29:39.188
with an army of police
coming at him?

29:39.188 --> 29:40.190
And how's your one‐on‐one

29:40.190 --> 29:41.192
approach working?

29:41.192 --> 29:42.595
'Cause he's gotten away, twice.

29:42.595 --> 29:44.065
This last time,
you almost got

29:44.065 --> 29:45.233
Murtaugh killed
in the process.

29:45.233 --> 29:46.102
You don't think branding him

29:46.102 --> 29:47.337
a murderer had anything
to do with that?

29:47.337 --> 29:48.373
On TV?

29:48.373 --> 29:49.475
All right,
he is scared

29:49.475 --> 29:50.611
because everyone
believes he's guilty.

29:50.611 --> 29:53.149
Yes, everyone but you.

29:55.020 --> 29:56.623
You're too close
to this, Riggs.

29:56.623 --> 29:58.026
Murtaugh was right.

29:58.026 --> 29:59.128
And this
devil‐may‐care attitude

29:59.128 --> 30:00.631
is gonna get him killed.

30:00.631 --> 30:02.401
You're off the case.

30:10.383 --> 30:13.256
So, who we going
to talk to?
Rodrigo Salazar.

30:13.256 --> 30:14.626
He's an explosive expert.

30:14.626 --> 30:16.530
I think he could help us.

30:16.530 --> 30:18.133
How do you know him?

30:18.133 --> 30:20.103
Don't worry about it.

30:20.103 --> 30:23.042
Just follow me.

30:23.042 --> 30:24.311
Mind waiting outside?

30:24.311 --> 30:26.249
(indistinct police transmission)

30:30.423 --> 30:32.361
(door shuts)

30:34.431 --> 30:36.068
(speaks Spanish)

30:37.304 --> 30:39.241
(speaks Spanish)

30:43.449 --> 30:45.453
(chuckles softly)

30:45.453 --> 30:47.357
I like the change of scenery,

30:47.357 --> 30:48.727
but there's
no chance

30:48.727 --> 30:50.598
I'm gonna help the cops.

30:50.598 --> 30:53.069
You don't think helping us out

30:53.069 --> 30:54.606
will help you out?

30:54.606 --> 30:56.543
Maybe knock
a few years off?

30:58.313 --> 31:01.118
I think this might interest you.

31:03.156 --> 31:05.528
Bomb went off
in Griffith Park.

31:05.528 --> 31:08.433
Almost killed two cops.

31:25.033 --> 31:27.337
M18. Claymore mine.

31:27.337 --> 31:28.373
Rigged to C‐4.

31:28.373 --> 31:30.176
That's the stuff.

31:30.176 --> 31:32.214
Any idea where he'd get
something like that from?

31:32.214 --> 31:34.184
Not easy.

31:34.184 --> 31:37.257
But that's the least of
your problems right now.

31:37.257 --> 31:39.596
Your bomber is making something
other than booby traps.

31:39.596 --> 31:41.132
(tapping)
This right here,

31:41.132 --> 31:43.236
these are pieces
of electrical wires.

31:43.236 --> 31:45.541
The kind you use
to daisy‐chain C‐4 together.

31:45.541 --> 31:47.377
Why would you do that?

31:47.377 --> 31:51.753
Listen, a block of C‐4
has enough boom.

31:51.753 --> 31:54.124
Wire a whole bunch together,

31:54.124 --> 31:57.130
rigged to blow up
in all directions‐‐

31:57.130 --> 31:59.468
that's enough
to level a building, homie.

32:05.480 --> 32:07.417
(siren wailing in distance)

32:13.262 --> 32:15.601
CRUZ:
Yo, Riggs.

32:15.601 --> 32:17.505
Got something for you.

32:18.607 --> 32:20.076
I'm good, Cruz.

32:20.076 --> 32:21.613
Got all I need
right here, buddy.

32:21.613 --> 32:23.717
It's about the explosives
Jackson used.

32:26.088 --> 32:29.161
Didn't you hear?
I'm off the case.

32:29.161 --> 32:32.401
I just figured
you'd want to know

32:32.401 --> 32:34.471
he managed to get enough C‐4
to level a building.

32:38.146 --> 32:41.218
Anybody else know
about this?

32:41.218 --> 32:42.555
I came to you first.

32:42.555 --> 32:44.759
Any idea what he's
gonna do with it?

32:46.863 --> 32:48.801
I sure hope not.

32:54.378 --> 32:57.384
(siren chirping,
tires screech)

33:05.534 --> 33:07.437
MURTAUGH: <i>Why do you think</i>
<i>Jackson's coming after Gaius?</i>

33:07.437 --> 33:08.674
He holds 'em all
responsible

33:08.674 --> 33:09.843
for poisoning the vets.

33:09.843 --> 33:11.580
When we were
in the park,

33:11.580 --> 33:13.149
he said he had
to finish his mission.

33:13.149 --> 33:14.351
I think this is it.

33:14.351 --> 33:16.823
Mission?
What mission?

33:16.823 --> 33:18.760
(loud thump,
power dies down)

33:18.760 --> 33:20.163
We're too late.
(alarm buzzing)

33:20.163 --> 33:22.802
Too late for what?
For what, Riggs?

33:22.802 --> 33:25.206
Jackson's gonna
blow up the building.

33:25.206 --> 33:27.645
This building? The building
we are currently in?

33:27.645 --> 33:30.183
And you're just getting around
to telling me this

33:30.183 --> 33:32.187
You might wanna think
of any last words to Trish.

33:32.187 --> 33:33.557
So make 'em good.
You don't want her,

33:33.557 --> 33:34.859
you know, crying
in Desmond's arms

33:34.859 --> 33:35.861
after you're gone.

33:35.861 --> 33:37.364
Don't bring up Desmond!

33:37.364 --> 33:39.201
You brought up Desmond
the other day.

33:39.201 --> 33:41.305
Take it easy!
Take it easy.
Let's go, let's go!

33:41.305 --> 33:44.311
You're gonna be fine.

33:44.311 --> 33:47.284
There's plenty of time.
You don't have to run!

33:47.284 --> 33:48.820
GIRL: Run, Jen!

33:48.820 --> 33:50.858
MAN: Everybody out!

33:50.858 --> 33:52.929
RIGGS: On the bright side,
we're still alive.

33:52.929 --> 33:54.766
Which means Jackson's
not completely crazy.

33:54.766 --> 33:57.370
Trying to blow up the building,
and that's normal to you.

33:59.241 --> 34:01.646
By any chance, did
you two exchange numbers?

34:01.646 --> 34:03.650
We're taking it slow, Rog.

34:03.650 --> 34:06.556
You know,
one step at a time.
Yeah.

34:06.556 --> 34:08.492
Okay, help me up

34:08.492 --> 34:09.629
We're gonna have
to climb up.

34:09.629 --> 34:11.766
Okay... okay.
(Murtaugh straining)

34:11.766 --> 34:13.637
Okay. Got it.

34:18.179 --> 34:20.751
RIGGS:
Okay, okay...

34:20.751 --> 34:23.489
We have to call
for backup.

34:23.489 --> 34:25.493
I'm back, sir. Look,
I just got a call from Riggs,

34:25.493 --> 34:26.395
and I don't know
if he's kidding,

34:26.395 --> 34:27.497
but...
What is it?

34:27.497 --> 34:29.736
He's asking for backup.

34:29.736 --> 34:33.777
Sent everyone. SWAT.
Hostage negotiators, <i>everyone!</i>

34:33.777 --> 34:36.916
(overlapping shouts)
Come on, this way...

34:40.356 --> 34:41.291
LAPD.
Put that weapon down!

34:41.291 --> 34:43.530
Put it away!
Detectives,
what's going in?

34:43.530 --> 34:44.932
We gotta get you guys
out of the building, let's go.

34:44.932 --> 34:48.507
Sorry, I can't
let that happen.

34:48.507 --> 34:49.642
Look, Jackson,
this is not the way.

34:49.642 --> 34:51.211
Oh, it's the only way.

34:52.548 --> 34:55.219
They poisoned my brothers!

34:56.756 --> 34:59.562
They poisoned
my brothers.

34:59.562 --> 35:01.700
I gotta make sure
it never happens again.

35:01.700 --> 35:02.835
Detectives,
please do something.

35:02.835 --> 35:04.505
He's going kill‐‐
Stop talking.

35:04.505 --> 35:05.373
(alarm buzzer droning)

35:08.714 --> 35:11.920
I'm not leaving, so,
you wanna take them out,

35:11.920 --> 35:14.191
you're gonna have my blood
on your hands, too.

35:17.263 --> 35:18.466
Mine, too.

35:19.902 --> 35:20.871
You tried to kill me twice,

35:20.871 --> 35:22.407
so I'm sure it doesn't have
the same impact,

35:22.407 --> 35:23.577
but we're in this together.

35:25.446 --> 35:27.752
You won.

35:27.752 --> 35:30.557
All right?
You proved your point.

35:30.557 --> 35:32.561
And you promised me
I could take you in

35:32.561 --> 35:33.864
after your mission
was done.

35:33.864 --> 35:36.936
Let me do my part.

35:36.936 --> 35:38.405
Let me prove
what they did.

35:42.848 --> 35:44.719
Come on, man.

35:44.719 --> 35:45.988
Too many good men
have already died.

35:48.994 --> 35:50.396
(mechanism beeps)

35:53.870 --> 35:55.039
RIGGS: You all right?

35:55.039 --> 35:58.045
Yeah... I'll live.

35:58.045 --> 35:59.615
We got a little problem.

35:59.615 --> 36:01.451
A round hit
the detonator.

36:01.451 --> 36:02.955
That's a large problem.

36:02.955 --> 36:04.291
(grunting)

36:04.291 --> 36:06.596
We gotta get rid of this thing.
What are you gonna
do with it?

36:06.596 --> 36:08.299
I don't know.
Throw it outside?

36:10.436 --> 36:12.440
Get away from the building!
Get away from the building!

36:12.440 --> 36:15.446
Move off the building!

36:15.446 --> 36:18.920
Everybody move!
Everybody move!

36:18.920 --> 36:21.491
Damn it!
Too many civilians.

36:21.491 --> 36:23.295
(beeping)

36:23.295 --> 36:26.870
(whispering) Wise men don't
jump off buildings.

36:26.870 --> 36:29.341
Let's see how good a shot
you really are. Come on, Riggs!

37:04.377 --> 37:05.179
I've done worse.

37:09.054 --> 37:10.958
Ooh, nice!

37:10.958 --> 37:13.395
Hold up, so you
crashed out a window,

37:13.395 --> 37:15.867
shot a bomb mid‐air, and then
fell into a swimming pool?

37:15.867 --> 37:18.606
No, Riggs shot the bomb.

Hey, don't worry, Dad,

37:26.756 --> 37:28.392
you're a winner
for even showing up

37:28.392 --> 37:30.062
to take this beatdown,
right, mom?
Right?

37:30.062 --> 37:32.601
(laughter)

37:32.601 --> 37:35.507
Careful, honey, last time
I poked the tiger

37:35.507 --> 37:37.845
I was up until 4:00
in the morning playing dominoes.

37:37.845 --> 37:39.147
'Cause that's how long
it took him to beat me.

37:39.147 --> 37:40.650
You got lucky that night.
Oh.

37:40.650 --> 37:43.122
We'll see who gets lucky.

37:43.122 --> 37:45.126
Oh, we... Oh, it's like that?

37:45.126 --> 37:46.863
Uh‐huh. Let's see
if you make this one.

37:46.863 --> 37:48.465
Playing innuendo?
All right, this one.

37:48.465 --> 37:50.036
Okay.

37:50.036 --> 37:52.006
Concentrate, concentrate.
Oh, my
goodness.

37:52.006 --> 37:53.510
Make the shot.
(chuckles)

37:53.510 --> 37:55.479
(grunts)

37:55.479 --> 37:56.816
Aw!

37:56.816 --> 37:58.419
Best two out of three, come on.

37:58.419 --> 38:00.089
Let's see if you make this one.

38:09.875 --> 38:12.013
Why don't you get off your ass
and quit sandbaggin', bud?

38:16.956 --> 38:18.960
Good news.

38:18.960 --> 38:20.597
They're dropping
the murder charges.

38:20.597 --> 38:23.469
They tied the gun to
Swinton's bodyguard.

38:26.174 --> 38:29.147
Still got some other charges
I'm looking at to deal with.

38:29.147 --> 38:31.084
Well, you been
through worse.

38:34.023 --> 38:35.627
Hey man, I just

38:35.627 --> 38:37.531
want to say
that, um...
No, don't.

38:37.531 --> 38:38.967
All right?

38:38.967 --> 38:41.539
All right? You ain't
got to, man. I...

38:44.578 --> 38:46.516
Do me a favor,
though.

38:48.620 --> 38:50.891
Trust her like you
trusted me, yeah?

38:52.828 --> 38:54.665
Oh, she help you out too?

38:58.573 --> 39:00.911
Well, let's just say
she understands complicated.

39:04.150 --> 39:05.820
Hooyah.

39:05.820 --> 39:08.593
Hooyah.

39:08.593 --> 39:10.496
I heard you <i>didn't</i>
stop yourself

39:10.496 --> 39:12.500
from jumping off
a building this time.

39:12.500 --> 39:14.905
Oh, talk to Murtaugh
about that.

39:14.905 --> 39:16.609
I was just
