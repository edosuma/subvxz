WEBVTT

01:57.343 --> 01:59.376
...en el nombre del Padre...

01:59.378 --> 02:01.244
y del Hijo...

02:01.246 --> 02:03.312
y del Espiritu Santo.

02:20.229 --> 02:22.896
- <i>Mire! Que es eso? - Dios mio!</i>

02:46.551 --> 02:49.351
Maria! Maria!

06:27.106 --> 06:30.340
I'll get us some burritos and
Cokes while you pull a few.

06:34.813 --> 06:38.948
The unions are squeezin' me,
threatenin' to burn this place down.

06:38.950 --> 06:42.751
I'm in a union.
That's a whole other thing.

06:42.753 --> 06:45.019
I'm talkin' about the life
and death of my operation...

06:45.021 --> 06:47.354
and half the factories in Los Angeles.

06:47.356 --> 06:49.622
They want a minimum wage.

06:49.624 --> 06:52.458
The day that I gotta start payin'
these people two-fifty an hour,

06:52.460 --> 06:53.959
my business is a memory.

06:55.729 --> 06:58.362
Well, I gotta have a couple of 'em.

06:58.364 --> 07:00.964
Take any two you want. Be my guest.

07:03.635 --> 07:08.004
<i>Who? Mendoza? You want 'im? Take 'im!</i>

07:08.006 --> 07:12.375
But I gotta tell ya, he's
got a lotta mouths to feed.

07:21.953 --> 07:24.687
All right, what about these two?

07:24.689 --> 07:26.588
<i>You want 'em? Take 'em.</i>

07:26.590 --> 07:29.957
<i>Senores? Uno momento.</i>

07:32.561 --> 07:35.728
<i>Tiene ninos? Si, tengo dos.</i>

07:35.730 --> 07:38.130
<i>Dos?</i>

07:38.132 --> 07:39.564
What about you?

07:39.566 --> 07:40.731
N <i> o. No tengo.</i>

07:40.733 --> 07:42.866
No tengo. <i>What about it, Lou?</i>

07:42.868 --> 07:46.035
You gonna have jobs for these
guys when they come back? Sure.

07:46.037 --> 07:48.170
These are good workers. Hey!

07:48.172 --> 07:50.739
<i>Buen trabajadores,</i> huh?

07:50.741 --> 07:53.475
When you come back, you got good jobs.
Six bucks a day.

07:53.477 --> 07:55.142
Over here.

07:58.881 --> 08:00.814
Lean up against the wall there.

08:03.084 --> 08:05.484
You're under arrest by the authority...

08:05.486 --> 08:08.687
of the United States Bureau...

08:08.689 --> 08:12.557
<i>Lou! of Naturalization and Immigration.</i>

08:12.559 --> 08:16.060
All right, I gotta go.
You're doin' a good job. Okay.

08:16.062 --> 08:19.029
Come on. Let's take a walk.

08:37.115 --> 08:39.849
Hi, hon! Charlie, there is no time. Hi.

08:39.851 --> 08:42.051
There is no time for anything at all.

08:42.053 --> 08:44.653
I didn't even have time
to wash my hair today.

08:45.756 --> 08:47.922
What do you do all day?

08:49.825 --> 08:53.793
Aha! Here it is. Look at that.

08:53.795 --> 08:55.928
<i>Johnny. You're looking
good tonight, Johnny.</i>

08:55.930 --> 08:58.063
What is it? Well, look at it.

08:58.065 --> 09:00.832
Isn't that the prettiest
duplex you ever did see?

09:04.571 --> 09:06.871
Where'd this come from? From El Paso.

09:06.873 --> 09:09.607
From my dear, darlin' friend Savannah.

09:09.609 --> 09:11.942
See the one marked in red? That's hers.

09:11.944 --> 09:14.678
She's made it possible for us
to have the one next to it.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.680
<i>Who's our first contestant tonight?</i>

09:16.682 --> 09:21.184
What are you talkin' about?
Buyin' a duplex? With what?

09:21.186 --> 09:23.819
<i>Darlin', right now the price is right.</i>

09:23.821 --> 09:27.088
The price is gonna skyrocket, and besides,
it's everything we ever dreamed of.

09:29.759 --> 09:32.258
I never dreamed of livin' in El Paso.

09:35.062 --> 09:38.797
<i>How hungry are you? Hungry-Man or normal?</i>

09:38.799 --> 09:41.499
Hungry-Man. You got it.

09:41.501 --> 09:45.569
I was thinkin' about maybe
goin' back in the...

09:45.571 --> 09:47.804
Recreation and Parks Service.

09:49.607 --> 09:52.174
<i>You gotta think of goin'
forward, not backward.</i>

09:53.744 --> 09:56.578
Remember when we
used to feed those ducks?

09:56.580 --> 09:59.047
Maybe the Forest Service.

09:59.049 --> 10:01.582
But, darlin', that's a dead end.

10:01.584 --> 10:06.587
I, uh, I liked feedin' those ducks.

10:06.589 --> 10:11.024
<i>It's my woman's intuition that things
could be better for us in El Paso.</i>

10:12.027 --> 10:14.293
I just wanna talk about it.

10:14.295 --> 10:16.828
<i>You've got six more seconds.</i>

10:16.830 --> 10:20.631
We never talk about anything, Marcy.
Did you ever realize that?

10:20.633 --> 10:23.200
We never fuckin' talk about anything.

10:23.202 --> 10:26.203
I am available to talk
any time you would like.

12:26.973 --> 12:29.940
<i>Es Norte America.</i>

12:29.942 --> 12:31.441
<i>Si.</i>

12:52.426 --> 12:55.126
They're here!

12:57.096 --> 12:58.962
<i>They're here now!</i>

13:02.400 --> 13:06.101
Just look at it! It's just
like the picture says.

13:06.103 --> 13:09.070
Charlie, I'm in paradise. I believe
I'm gonna sprout wings and a halo!

13:09.072 --> 13:12.406
Marcy! Marcy! Oh-ho!

13:12.408 --> 13:15.842
<i>I'm so glad to see you!
I'm the welcome wagon!</i>

13:15.844 --> 13:18.477
<i>Look at you! Oh, we're here!</i>

13:18.479 --> 13:22.113
Oh, we made it! I can't believe it!

13:22.115 --> 13:24.315
<i>Oh, you look so good!</i>

13:24.317 --> 13:26.116
This here's Charlie.

13:28.386 --> 13:30.185
<i>Hi. Hi.</i>

13:33.156 --> 13:35.289
Well, now, he's really cute.

13:35.291 --> 13:38.158
Thanks.

13:38.160 --> 13:40.827
And you're Cat! Real nice to meet you.

13:40.829 --> 13:45.131
You must be Timmy. Aren't
you the darlin'est thing!

13:45.133 --> 13:47.500
How ya doin', Charlie? <i>Fine. Doin' fine.</i>

13:47.502 --> 13:49.969
Have a nice trip? Yeah. Nice to meet you.

13:49.971 --> 13:52.171
This is Timmy. Shake the
man's hand, son. Timmy.

13:52.173 --> 13:54.306
Don't you wanna see
what you bought yourself?

13:54.308 --> 13:56.908
Come on in. I turned the
air conditioner on.

13:56.910 --> 13:58.876
Don't go havin' vapors, honey.
You wait. It's blazin', huh?

13:58.878 --> 14:00.911
Cool today. Carry her. What?

14:00.913 --> 14:03.346
You have got to carry her. Oh--

14:03.348 --> 14:06.048
Sa-- Savannah. Savannah, come on.

14:06.050 --> 14:09.184
The man's just driven a thousand miles.
I've put on a little--

14:09.186 --> 14:12.187
Go on now. Cross the threshold.
We've been married 11 years.

14:12.189 --> 14:14.155
<i>Okay. I suppose it's never too late.</i>

14:14.157 --> 14:16.123
Come on. I'll carry you in.

14:16.125 --> 14:18.125
Up you go. Oh!

14:18.127 --> 14:20.961
Atta boy! You got her.

14:20.963 --> 14:23.897
Don't bump me into the door!

14:23.899 --> 14:26.099
Oh. Oh!

14:26.101 --> 14:29.235
It's just--
It's beautiful!

14:29.237 --> 14:32.271
It's just perfectly beautiful!

14:32.273 --> 14:35.407
Oh! It's so lovely. I don't believe it!

14:40.914 --> 14:43.047
And that's where we'll put the Nu-Vue.

14:43.048 --> 14:45.181
Nu-Vue just happens to be one of the
top pool manufacturing companies.

14:45.184 --> 14:48.552
Oh, I could cry! Really.

14:48.554 --> 14:52.088
Mm.
I think you're all gonna like it here.

14:52.090 --> 14:54.356
Oh-ho. Oh, I know we are.

14:54.358 --> 14:56.624
Dad, I wanna go swimming.

14:56.626 --> 14:59.627
Okay, Timmy, go ahead.
Don't stay in too long now.

14:59.629 --> 15:02.363
<i>You're not talking
a whole bunch, Charlie.</i>

15:02.365 --> 15:05.199
Yeah, well, I'm just
takin' everything in.

15:06.936 --> 15:09.002
Thanks. Well, here's a great big kiss...

15:09.004 --> 15:12.171
for bringin' my little Marcy back
home to Texas where she belongs.

15:13.641 --> 15:16.375
Isn't she as pretty as I said she'd be?

15:16.377 --> 15:19.077
She sure is.
Well, I used to be somethin'.

15:19.079 --> 15:23.414
But now I drive past the high and all them
little girls are wearin' my old tits.

15:26.185 --> 15:28.518
<i>Hey, Marcy, do you still think
we could knock them dead?</i>

15:28.520 --> 15:31.705
I know we can.

15:31.706 --> 15:34.891
She ever tell you how we could ginger up
a whole stadium? Let's show 'em, honey.

15:34.893 --> 15:37.894
A one and a two and a ba-ba-ba-ba.

15:37.896 --> 15:41.631
Eagles born and Eagles bred.

15:41.633 --> 15:45.301
When I die, I'll be in Eagles' heaven.

15:45.303 --> 15:48.937
Fight, you Eagles, knock 'em dead!

15:48.939 --> 15:52.240
'Cause if we win, we'll give you head!

15:54.010 --> 15:57.411
I didn't say that. No way!
I did not. Yes, you did.

15:57.413 --> 15:58.945
Charlie, I figure you and me
have scored the best damn

15:58.947 --> 16:02.214
pussy in the whole state of Texas.

16:05.185 --> 16:07.685
Charlie, you ought to get
the shirts tailored.

16:09.288 --> 16:12.222
They'll look a whole lot better.
You think so?

16:12.224 --> 16:14.691
Well, it's a matter of preference.

16:14.693 --> 16:16.526
I get mine done that way.

16:19.597 --> 16:23.665
Well, uh, what's the cost
to get the tailoring done?

16:23.667 --> 16:26.200
The shirts will cost you
ten dollars each.

16:26.202 --> 16:28.468
We can narrow the pants for five.

16:28.470 --> 16:31.204
They got some really nice boots here.

16:31.206 --> 16:34.473
You oughtta look at a pair, Charlie.
I better take it easy.

16:34.475 --> 16:37.509
$125 clothing allowance, you know.

16:37.511 --> 16:40.512
I wouldn't worry about that.
Buster can bill you for it.

16:40.514 --> 16:43.281
Give you some time to get caught up.
Right, Buster? That's right.

16:43.283 --> 16:47.318
Free for 30 days.

16:47.320 --> 16:51.288
No, I think I better take it just
the way it comes off the rack.

17:00.532 --> 17:05.367
I can't tell you how glad
I am to have you down here.

17:05.369 --> 17:09.070
Well, I want to thank you and
your wife for all your help.

17:09.073 --> 17:11.106
Well, it's you that's helpin' me.

17:11.108 --> 17:15.242
I'm stuck with guys down here that are too
dumb to roll rocks down a steep hill.

17:17.446 --> 17:20.481
No reason why you can't move
real fast down here, Charlie.

17:20.483 --> 17:22.015
Real fast.

17:27.288 --> 17:29.421
Today your partner's a guy named Hawker.

17:29.423 --> 17:32.991
He's a real son of a bitch,
but he knows what he's doin'.

17:32.993 --> 17:37.161
- Why'd you transfer out here?
- Needed a change.

17:37.163 --> 17:40.764
<i>My wife's from Dallas.
How long's the fence?</i>

17:40.766 --> 17:42.999
The Tortilla Curtain?

17:43.001 --> 17:45.634
You only have to go
three miles to get around it.

17:45.636 --> 17:48.570
People just cut holes in it.
Saves 'em a lot of time.

17:48.572 --> 17:51.272
You'll find there's a pretty
good bunch of boys here.

17:51.274 --> 17:55.009
<i>You'll find you can pretty
much trust 'em-- most of 'em.</i>

17:55.011 --> 18:00.013
You know, it's funny what you can see in a
man. Just... the way he wears his clothes.

18:01.649 --> 18:05.017
The uniform's supposed to
make everyone the same.

18:05.019 --> 18:07.686
<i>That's what the word means.
Uniform. But if you--</i>

18:12.592 --> 18:18.061
<i>Venganse! Andale! Andale! Pronto! Pronto!</i>

18:18.063 --> 18:20.163
Julio! Ven aca!

18:20.165 --> 18:22.231
<i>Pronto! Pronto!</i>

18:25.769 --> 18:30.271
Day workers mostly. Come over in
the mornin', go back at night.

18:30.273 --> 18:33.674
No way to stop 'em;
no point in really botherin'.

18:33.676 --> 18:36.677
You ever throw dirt clods as a kid?

18:36.679 --> 18:38.544
Well, it's the same damn game.

18:41.315 --> 18:43.648
This is a desert.

18:43.650 --> 18:46.317
There ain't a dirt clod
to be found for miles.

18:46.319 --> 18:49.153
It doesn't really get rough
'til after dark. I get it.

18:54.726 --> 18:58.761
Coyote's the one in the lead.

18:58.763 --> 19:02.331
We usually let 'em get across. It's
easier to pick 'em up on this side.

19:07.738 --> 19:10.071
See, if you surprise 'em in the river,

19:10.073 --> 19:12.840
they just hunker down in the
water there and get pneumonia.

19:12.842 --> 19:15.308
I figure life is tough enough for
'em without makin' it worse.

19:18.446 --> 19:21.413
- You wanna watch us book 'em in?
- Sure.

19:21.415 --> 19:23.815
<i>Hurry up! Let's go!</i>

19:36.762 --> 19:40.797
I brought my man Charlie here
to see how you big boys work.

19:53.577 --> 19:56.578
Sanchez. Sanchez, why don't you start...

19:56.580 --> 19:59.447
goin' on back over
to Nogales and crossin' there?

19:59.449 --> 20:03.451
Hell, we been drivin' you back so often,
we'll have to start chargin' you bus fare.

20:03.453 --> 20:05.853
We got a call. We gotta go.

20:13.395 --> 20:15.461
Hold your ass.

20:39.152 --> 20:41.785
We don't usually get calls from up here.

20:41.787 --> 20:44.387
Just stay here. Okay.

21:06.577 --> 21:09.277
Hawker? Hawker!

21:10.546 --> 21:12.913
Hawker? Hawker!

21:14.716 --> 21:16.849
Station One? Station One?

21:16.851 --> 21:20.285
This is Charlie Smith.
Get us some goddamn help!

21:32.432 --> 21:35.232
Where is he? I don't know.
I didn't see him go down.

21:35.234 --> 21:37.834
He was right out here
in front of the truck.

21:37.836 --> 21:40.502
You see him? You got him? Hawker?

21:42.239 --> 21:44.272
Hawker?

21:44.274 --> 21:47.575
Gimme some cover, Charlie.
Okay, you ready? Yeah.

21:49.946 --> 21:51.945
You ready? Go! Ready. Go.

21:57.551 --> 22:00.552
He's fuckin' dead!

22:00.554 --> 22:04.455
They had it on the radio this morning.
We heard it when we were comin' in.

22:04.457 --> 22:08.726
Bastards! You didn't really get any
kind of a look at 'em, huh, Charlie?

22:08.728 --> 22:10.994
No, I didn't really.

22:10.996 --> 22:14.397
Well, F.B.I. will probably send
some boys, poke around up there.

22:14.399 --> 22:16.932
If there's any kind
of evidence, they'll find it.

22:16.934 --> 22:21.670
I figure he probably came on some dopers.
Surprised them and--

22:21.672 --> 22:24.505
Tough break for you,
Charlie, first time out.

22:26.942 --> 22:29.341
Fuckin' dopers! <i>Andy!</i>

22:32.045 --> 22:35.079
You tell them damn mechanics
of ours, Andy,

22:35.081 --> 22:39.016
that the speedometer on my rig
says 140 miles an hour,

22:39.018 --> 22:43.920
and it damn well better go 140 miles
an hour the next time I want it to.

22:43.922 --> 22:46.789
Yes, sir. Red, this here's Charlie Smith.

22:48.025 --> 22:51.559
Sir. Oh.

22:51.561 --> 22:54.061
Hello there, Charlie.

22:54.063 --> 22:57.531
I been wantin' to meet you,
welcome you to the unit.

22:57.533 --> 23:01.133
I'm real sorry it had to be
under circumstances like this.

23:03.770 --> 23:06.003
Right face!

23:06.939 --> 23:09.940
Arms up!

23:09.942 --> 23:12.776
Ready, fire!

23:12.778 --> 23:15.779
Ready, fire!

23:15.781 --> 23:18.782
Ready, fire!

23:18.784 --> 23:20.984
Left face!

23:21.920 --> 23:24.019
Present arms!

25:06.688 --> 25:08.554
<i>Buenas tardes.</i>

25:15.562 --> 25:17.828
<i>Su nina es bonita.</i>

25:17.830 --> 25:19.896
<i>Gracias.</i>

25:28.606 --> 25:30.606
Hey! Hey!

25:44.855 --> 25:47.589
I'll break your goddamn <i>cabeza</i> in half!

26:06.008 --> 26:08.942
<i>Sueltalos, te digo! Sueltalos!</i>

26:08.944 --> 26:11.010
<i>No quiero nada con un ladron!</i>

26:11.012 --> 26:13.045
Vete de aqui. Sueltalos!

26:18.685 --> 26:21.818
<i>Son de usted? Si.</i>

26:23.054 --> 26:25.054
<i>Gracias.</i>

26:32.129 --> 26:34.028
<i>Gracias, senora.</i>

26:43.873 --> 26:45.072
<i>Senora?</i>

26:47.309 --> 26:49.342
<i>Senora, espera.</i>

27:31.351 --> 27:33.884
<i>Save the last dance for me.</i>

27:37.723 --> 27:40.690
You made me a whole man again.

27:40.692 --> 27:43.792
But now, Carla, I, I have
something to tell you. Marcy?

27:45.095 --> 27:48.029
Isn't it beautiful?

27:48.031 --> 27:51.932
Goddamn! What did
this fuckin' thing cost?

27:53.635 --> 27:55.768
Did you say something?

27:55.770 --> 27:59.638
I was askin' you how much this cost?

27:59.640 --> 28:02.774
We don't have to worry
about paying for it...

28:02.776 --> 28:05.109
because I opened up a charge
account at the Galleria.

28:05.111 --> 28:07.310
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

28:10.348 --> 28:12.648
Charlie, um--

28:14.652 --> 28:16.652
Am I gaining weight?

28:19.657 --> 28:21.923
Well, I suppose you are.

28:21.925 --> 28:24.258
You eat so goddamn much.

28:29.998 --> 28:33.331
Don't be funnin' me. I know
you like the way I feel.

28:35.968 --> 28:38.168
Don't you wanna feel it?

28:38.170 --> 28:42.105
Feel it? Mm-hmm.

28:45.276 --> 28:47.943
Carla, I can't--

28:47.945 --> 28:50.445
Charlie, do you know somethin'?

28:50.447 --> 28:56.183
It stays real cold,
real cold in the summer,

28:56.185 --> 29:00.820
and it can get real <i>hot</i> in the winter.

29:00.822 --> 29:03.122
<i>I'm leaving on the</i> QE II <i>Tuesday.</i>

29:03.124 --> 29:06.058
We'll go together.
We'll go to another place.

29:06.060 --> 29:08.760
<i>We can't. You've missed the point. Well.</i>

29:10.897 --> 29:13.364
Captain Cook's Fish Fiesta.

29:13.366 --> 29:17.034
<i>A heapin' bucket of giant jumbo shrimp,</i>

29:17.036 --> 29:20.070
<i>succulent chunks of fried fish,</i>

29:20.072 --> 29:22.906
<i>luscious bites of langostino.</i>

29:22.908 --> 29:25.341
Mmm. I'd better cast off for

29:25.343 --> 29:28.377
Captain Cook's Fish Fiesta right now.

29:28.379 --> 29:32.047
And remember, no fishy smell,
no fishy taste.

29:32.049 --> 29:35.183
<i>Shipshape clean, and the eating's great.</i>

30:15.157 --> 30:17.056
<i>Levantense ya.</i>

30:19.393 --> 30:21.259
Todos en una linea.

30:24.831 --> 30:27.031
I got him.

30:41.246 --> 30:43.779
Okay. Okay. Ya no puedo! Dejame!

30:43.781 --> 30:45.914
<i>Sientate. Momentito.</i>

30:45.916 --> 30:47.215
<i>Alto.</i>

30:53.489 --> 30:56.089
<i>Easy, Cat, easy. -"Easy"?</i>

31:02.863 --> 31:04.362
Ever see this before?

31:06.299 --> 31:08.465
Push this in grammar schools, Charlie.

31:08.467 --> 31:11.968
Ten-year-old kids gettin' hooked on this.
Stick him in the box for me.

31:24.548 --> 31:26.915
Todas las mujeres y los ninos aqui.

31:28.018 --> 31:30.018
Los hombres por aca.

31:34.290 --> 31:35.289
Vengan.

31:39.060 --> 31:40.259
<i>Senora?</i>

31:42.263 --> 31:44.296
<i>Si. Yo.</i>

31:47.034 --> 31:50.402
<i>Mis--</i> Uh--
<i>Mis</i> hubcaps.

31:52.005 --> 31:53.537
<i>No, no, no.</i>

31:53.539 --> 31:56.006
Por favor. No, no, no, no, no. <i>Suelteme!</i>

31:56.008 --> 31:57.907
Quit this. <i>Suelteme, pendejo!</i>

31:57.909 --> 31:59.875
<i>Por favor. Por favor. Basta.</i>

31:59.877 --> 32:02.444
I believe that woman kinda went for you!

32:02.446 --> 32:05.079
Goddamn, Beef. You think that's funny.
That was a Mexican come-on!

32:16.525 --> 32:19.192
Quieres agua, hombre? <i>No, no quiero agua.</i>

32:19.194 --> 32:20.393
Okay.

32:26.067 --> 32:28.233
This here's my eye, Charlie.

32:28.235 --> 32:30.468
How ya doin'? He works
with us on the other side.

32:30.470 --> 32:32.636
Manuel, Charlie. Como esta, Manuel?

32:32.638 --> 32:36.139
<i>Aqui, no mas. They can use you
over in the write-up room.</i>

32:37.108 --> 32:39.141
Adios. <i>Orale!</i>

32:49.453 --> 32:52.320
You got any idea what they're gettin'
for Wets delivered up north?

32:52.322 --> 32:55.656
Haven't got a clue. Five hundred
and fifty bucks a head.

32:55.658 --> 32:58.592
Well, I guess we're sendin'
them the wrong way, aren't we?

32:58.594 --> 33:01.661
Hell, Texas's been runnin' on Wet
labor since before I was born.

33:01.663 --> 33:05.097
<i>Does pretty damn good too. You think
this country'd get by without Wets?</i>

33:05.099 --> 33:07.265
<i>You go out on some boilin' hot day...</i>

33:07.267 --> 33:10.268
<i>and pick your own lettuce and
tomatoes and beans and onions.</i>

33:10.270 --> 33:12.470
Jimbo, sounds like you're figurin'
on turnin' in that uniform...

33:12.472 --> 33:15.039
and becomin' a coyote.

33:15.041 --> 33:18.208
Brush up on his Spanish and
he'd make a damn good coyote.

33:18.210 --> 33:20.410
Hey, Charlie, how you spell illiterate?

33:20.412 --> 33:24.046
Only a gourd-head would ask
a stupid question like that.

33:24.048 --> 33:26.348
Look it up in the dictionary.

33:26.350 --> 33:29.584
How're you supposed to look
it up if you can't spell it?

33:37.259 --> 33:40.460
Como se llama, usted? Maria.

33:40.462 --> 33:43.262
<i>Here ya go, Charlie.
Got a live one for ya.</i>

34:03.648 --> 34:06.148
Seems kinda silly, don't it?

34:06.150 --> 34:09.016
We're bustin' our asses to send 'em back,

34:09.018 --> 34:11.351
and respectable businesspeople
payin' to bring 'em in.

34:14.422 --> 34:17.724
I guess out in L.A.
it was pretty much the same.

34:17.726 --> 34:19.958
Pretty much, yeah.

34:19.960 --> 34:23.161
There sure as hell ain't no way
to ever stop 'em, is there?

34:28.268 --> 34:32.103
Man of your experience
must know that sometimes...

34:32.105 --> 34:34.138
it makes no sense to even try.

34:38.812 --> 34:40.844
Somebody shit in your beer?

34:43.516 --> 34:45.215
What are you fishin' for?

34:48.652 --> 34:52.321
You and me might have some of the
same ideas about things, Charlie.

34:52.322 --> 34:55.489
I mean, we're neighbors.

34:55.492 --> 35:01.128
And-- I'm tryin' to build
somethin' for my family.

35:01.130 --> 35:06.133
And I know how hard you been working to
build somethin' for yourself and Marcy.

35:06.135 --> 35:09.502
I'm onto somethin' good, partner, and
I figured maybe I could bring you in.

35:12.173 --> 35:14.373
Yeah, well, you figured wrong, Cat.

35:16.577 --> 35:19.277
<i>Hey. Okay.</i>

35:20.813 --> 35:23.180
Any way you want it, partner.

35:23.182 --> 35:26.316
I mean, I'll fight ya,
fuck ya, run ya a footrace.

35:26.318 --> 35:29.152
Whatever you want, Charlie.

35:29.154 --> 35:31.220
'Cause I want us to be friends.

35:39.229 --> 35:41.395
Hi, hon.

35:44.400 --> 35:47.267
Hi. Charlie, I'm gonna show you.

35:48.403 --> 35:49.902
What?

35:49.904 --> 35:52.237
What is your opinion--

35:52.239 --> 35:54.572
your honest opinion of TV?

35:57.410 --> 36:01.445
I think it sucks.
<i>No, Charlie. I mean for me.</i>

36:01.447 --> 36:03.914
For me. I must be missing
the point, Marcy.

36:03.916 --> 36:06.516
As a medium for my expression.

36:06.518 --> 36:10.186
Now, Savannah says that I have
a certain style.

36:10.188 --> 36:12.855
What happened to your face?

36:12.857 --> 36:16.592
Are you trying to tell me that
you want to be on television?

36:16.594 --> 36:19.461
Charlie, it is a seed.

36:19.463 --> 36:23.765
It is a little, tiny seed
that is sprouting in my mind.

36:23.767 --> 36:26.300
I married a banana.

36:26.302 --> 36:28.602
I married a fuckin' banana.

36:28.604 --> 36:32.472
Charlie, I am serious. I have never
been more serious in my life.

36:32.474 --> 36:35.308
I don't know how you
would get a job like that.

36:35.310 --> 36:38.678
I don't even know how a person
would get a job-- It's just that--

36:38.680 --> 36:42.348
<i>Oh! Charlie, my God! What are you doing?</i>

36:42.350 --> 36:45.918
What the fuck is this, Marcy?
It's our new swimming pool!

36:45.920 --> 36:48.220
Charlie, are you all right?

37:10.344 --> 37:12.243
<i>Senora?</i>

37:16.582 --> 37:19.249
<i>Perdoname, senora.</i>

38:12.568 --> 38:15.535
Hey, man, you want to go fuck some girls?

38:15.537 --> 38:16.936
No.

38:20.908 --> 38:23.875
- Pinche gringo!
- Mamalon!

39:35.379 --> 39:37.579
Flat on my back,

39:37.581 --> 39:41.382
and in walks the cutest
blue-eyed doctor you ever saw,

39:41.384 --> 39:43.550
and he asks me if I'm ready.

39:43.552 --> 39:45.552
All right, Savannah, that's enough.

39:45.554 --> 39:47.654
Honey, I'm just havin'
a little fun, okay?

39:47.656 --> 39:49.689
It was years before we was married.

39:49.691 --> 39:52.692
Don't be inhibitin' me 'cause
you know how pissed off I get!

39:52.694 --> 39:56.829
Then what happened? I said, "I have
never in my life been more ready.

39:56.831 --> 39:58.997
<i>You don't have to
etherize me or nothin'!"</i>

40:06.673 --> 40:09.640
Marcy. Charlie, where have you been?

40:09.642 --> 40:12.709
I gotta talk to Cat. What are
you doing dressed like this,

40:12.711 --> 40:15.778
comin' to this nice party
with all this nice stuff?

40:15.780 --> 40:17.713
Where's Cat? I don't know.

40:17.715 --> 40:19.981
But look at the way
you're dressed. Charlie!

40:19.983 --> 40:23.117
I had this dream I was makin' these
little bitty grunts comin' out--

40:23.119 --> 40:25.486
Charlie! Excuse me.

40:25.488 --> 40:28.155
Can I talk to you, Cat?
My God, you are sweaty!

40:28.157 --> 40:30.657
What happened to you? Can I talk to you?

40:30.659 --> 40:33.026
I love sweaty men.
Will you excuse me? Sure.

40:33.028 --> 40:35.395
You wicked girl!

40:37.665 --> 40:40.866
That kid is dead. What kid?

40:40.868 --> 40:44.802
The one we pulled last week. The kid
with the dope on him. He's fuckin' dead.

40:46.038 --> 40:48.538
The one last week?
I turned him over to Manuel.

40:48.540 --> 40:50.540
Well, somebody slit his goddamn throat.

40:50.542 --> 40:54.677
I left him on the other side with his
Adam's apple all over his fuckin' chest.

40:54.679 --> 40:58.681
Jesus Christ. Well--

40:58.683 --> 41:03.885
The kid was a doper. They have their
own way of dealin' with things.

41:03.887 --> 41:06.621
What you sayin'? Manuel did it?

41:06.623 --> 41:10.958
I don't know who killed him. I only know
he's dead 'cause you're tellin' me.

41:10.960 --> 41:15.095
The Mexicans, they have their own
kind of justice, same as we do.

41:15.097 --> 41:19.599
We all take care of our own. Dopers
kill and they get killed all the time.

41:19.601 --> 41:23.002
Well, hello there, Charlie.

41:24.638 --> 41:28.806
Say, uh, you didn't have to
dress up on my account.

41:28.808 --> 41:31.942
You better check his green card, Cat.
I think he's come in wet.

41:31.944 --> 41:34.511
Red, uh--

41:34.513 --> 41:37.647
That-- That doper
we brought in last week--

41:37.649 --> 41:40.950
Charlie found him over on the other side.
He's dead.

41:40.952 --> 41:43.786
I already called the Rangers.

41:43.788 --> 41:45.821
What're you doin' over there, Charlie?

41:53.096 --> 41:56.730
- I just went over there to look around.
- Uh-huh.

41:56.732 --> 41:59.733
Well, maybe you don't know this, but, uh,

41:59.735 --> 42:04.003
I don't like my men goin' over
there-- not even for a Mexican meal.

42:04.005 --> 42:08.173
You get in trouble over there, and I'd
have a hell of a time gettin' you out.

42:09.943 --> 42:11.943
Well, what the hell. Let's have some fun.

42:14.981 --> 42:18.482
â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª

42:18.484 --> 42:21.785
â™ª Happy birthday, dear Red â™ª

42:21.787 --> 42:24.921
â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª

42:24.923 --> 42:27.790
â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª

42:27.792 --> 42:30.959
â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª

42:30.961 --> 42:35.096
â™ª Happy birthday, dear Red â™ª

42:35.098 --> 42:39.266
â™ª Happy birthday to you â™ª

43:18.304 --> 43:21.772
Get up! Let's go!
Let's get together here!

43:21.774 --> 43:23.740
En linea, por favor. Come on. Move it!

43:23.742 --> 43:26.576
Move it! Move it on now!

43:26.578 --> 43:29.078
Ah, senores.

43:29.080 --> 43:31.780
Esto no es un tren de pasajeros.

43:32.983 --> 43:37.051
<i>Bajense, por favor.</i>

43:42.024 --> 43:45.158
<i>Juan! I got him! I got him!</i>

43:45.160 --> 43:46.993
<i>Juan, esperate! No seas tonto!</i>

44:19.624 --> 44:21.023
Charlie?

44:22.960 --> 44:25.026
Are you all right? Yeah.

44:27.663 --> 44:31.131
<i>Juan, estas bien? Okay, Charlie?</i>

44:31.133 --> 44:35.001
Man, you had me scared shitless.

44:35.003 --> 44:38.170
Absolutely scared shitless. Riskin'
your life for that little fucker!

45:16.141 --> 45:18.074
<i>Hiya, Charlie.</i>

45:25.950 --> 45:28.116
Hey, Charlie. Chief wants to see ya.

45:37.660 --> 45:39.826
<i>Hola. Como estas?</i>

45:39.828 --> 45:42.428
<i>Muy bien. Y usted? Bien. Es la muchacha?</i>

45:42.430 --> 45:44.830
La que tiene un nino.

45:45.999 --> 45:48.833
<i>Hey, Charlie. Oh, hi, Red.</i>

45:48.835 --> 45:51.001
How ya doin'? Fine.

45:51.003 --> 45:54.838
Cat told me about
the incident on the train.

45:54.840 --> 45:57.140
That was a fine piece of work.

45:57.142 --> 45:59.208
Oh, thanks. How 'bout a chew?

46:00.778 --> 46:02.811
Uh, no.

46:02.813 --> 46:06.880
Well, I chew at work. My wife
don't like it around the house.

46:09.384 --> 46:11.751
Shoot? "Shoot"?

46:11.753 --> 46:13.953
Birds. No.

46:13.955 --> 46:16.355
In October, we got ducks sittin'

46:16.357 --> 46:19.124
in these levies down here
thicker than flies on shit.

46:19.126 --> 46:22.760
Well, I haven't done much
huntin' since I was a kid.

46:22.762 --> 46:24.394
Yeah, well, don't worry about it.

46:24.396 --> 46:26.929
I'll let you have
my wide-pattern Browning.

46:26.931 --> 46:28.430
Can't miss. Won't embarrass you.

46:47.748 --> 46:49.914
Que bonito que es su nino!

46:49.916 --> 46:53.050
Pobrecito, tanto calor.
No quiere ir a lavarse?

46:53.052 --> 46:55.385
Mire, yo se lo cuido
nada mas un ratitito.

46:55.387 --> 46:58.788
Si me lo da a mi,
yo se cuido lo muy bien.

46:58.790 --> 47:02.858
Luego va y se lava y yo se lo regreso.
Quiere? Ande. Deme. Bu <i> eno.</i>

47:02.860 --> 47:05.293
Yo se lo cuido.

47:05.295 --> 47:07.295
<i>Esta dormido. Si. Si, se lo cuido.</i>

47:09.299 --> 47:12.800
Asi, andale. Yo se lo cuido, eh? <i>Gracias.</i>

47:23.444 --> 47:26.944
I'm sure I'm not gonna be tellin'
you anything you don't know.

47:28.814 --> 47:32.215
The game's a little different
around here.

47:32.217 --> 47:36.053
<i>There's some real big money on the table.</i>

47:36.055 --> 47:39.923
<i>Smart man, he's gonna play his cards
right tight up against his chest.</i>

47:49.200 --> 47:53.001
<i>Mi nino! Donde esta mi nino?</i>

47:54.337 --> 47:56.870
<i>Donde esta la senora que tenia mi nino?</i>

47:56.872 --> 48:00.106
<i>Donde esta su companera?</i>

48:00.108 --> 48:02.908
<i>Donde esta mi nino?
Me han robado mi nino!</i>

48:08.315 --> 48:12.016
Abran la puerta, por favor!
Se robaron a mi hijo!

48:12.018 --> 48:15.052
Abran la puerta! <i>Maria.</i>

48:15.054 --> 48:16.520
What's goin' on back there?

48:16.522 --> 48:18.121
Abran la puerta!

48:33.201 --> 48:37.469
Of course, if some farmer throws a sack
of onions in the back of your car,

48:37.471 --> 48:41.172
I don't mind you leavin'
a few Wets in his field.

48:41.174 --> 48:43.440
<i>But anything unusual comes up,</i>

48:43.442 --> 48:46.476
by God, I better be
the first to know about it.

48:48.346 --> 48:51.046
What's all that hollerin' about?

49:03.624 --> 49:07.392
What the hell's goin' on?
Well, get 'em outta here!

49:07.394 --> 49:09.227
Get 'em on the buses! Get 'em out!

49:09.229 --> 49:11.963
Get 'em back to Mexico!

49:11.965 --> 49:14.031
I don't need no confrontation.

50:02.008 --> 50:04.241
<i>Mi nino!</i>

50:08.480 --> 50:10.746
<i>Nice work, boys! Nice work!</i>

50:10.748 --> 50:12.748
Thank you. Good job. Good job.

50:12.750 --> 50:16.351
You fellas who are hurt,
you all get first aid.

50:16.353 --> 50:18.686
What happened
out there? I'm not sure, sir.

50:26.462 --> 50:30.697
Where the hell's that baby? Listen, man.
I'm telling you, it's okay.

50:30.699 --> 50:32.999
You stole a baby
outta the goddamn compound.

50:33.001 --> 50:35.134
What the hell you mean, "it's okay"?

50:35.136 --> 50:38.070
This ain't the little baby Jesus,
you know. It's just some <i>indio.</i>

50:38.072 --> 50:40.072
I don't go in for stealin' babies--

50:40.074 --> 50:43.241
indiobabies or any other kind.

50:43.243 --> 50:46.577
I don't cotton to that kinda shit!
Understand me?

50:49.381 --> 50:52.648
Don't worry, man. The kid is okay.

50:52.650 --> 50:55.484
An Anglo family.
They paid big money for him.

50:55.486 --> 50:58.720
He's gonna have it real good.
Big cars, swimming pools.

50:58.722 --> 51:03.524
We did a good thing for him. I just make
a little money on the side. No big deal.

51:03.526 --> 51:06.393
I told you before.

51:06.395 --> 51:09.062
We're in the business of
movin' Wets and nothin' else.

51:09.064 --> 51:12.131
You ever come across
runnin' babies or dope...

51:12.133 --> 51:14.433
or any other goddamn thing, and...

51:14.435 --> 51:16.768
I'm gonna knock your fuckin'
dick into the dirt.

51:19.339 --> 51:22.440
Okay. Okay.

51:22.442 --> 51:25.643
Don't worry, man. With me,
you ain't got no problem.

51:38.457 --> 51:43.326
That's him. <i>El Scorcho. The Burned Face.</i>

51:43.328 --> 51:45.328
<i>He's running Wets on our territory.</i>

51:45.330 --> 51:49.131
<i>Competition, amigo.</i>

51:49.133 --> 51:51.133
This makes up the total order, ma'am.

51:51.135 --> 51:53.502
- Just tell the boys where to spot that sofa.
<i>- Okay.</i>

51:53.504 --> 51:55.470
<i>Be careful goin' through
the door, you all.</i>

51:55.472 --> 51:57.738
I think it'll look nice right over there.

51:57.740 --> 51:59.806
<i>What about this thing and the breakfront?</i>

51:59.808 --> 52:02.141
Oh. Well, I don't know.

52:02.143 --> 52:04.276
I think the--

52:04.278 --> 52:06.611
and the breakfront
over there by the wall.

52:06.613 --> 52:08.479
<i>Get it right in that corner there.</i>

52:16.654 --> 52:19.154
<i>Well, we'll just put it right in there.</i>

52:21.658 --> 52:24.191
Um, yeah, I think-- <i>If there's
anything else, ma'am,</i>

52:24.193 --> 52:26.359
<i>you just speak right up.</i>

52:26.361 --> 52:29.528
You want the plastic on or off the sofa?

52:29.530 --> 52:31.730
I want it out.

52:31.732 --> 52:33.865
Oh. Oh, hi, honey. You're up.

52:33.867 --> 52:37.101
Um, I was, uh--
I was gonna surprise you.

52:37.103 --> 52:39.570
<i>Um, I think I'll take
the plastic off myself, okay?</i>

52:39.572 --> 52:41.805
<i>Very well, ma'am. That's all. Sign here.</i>

52:41.807 --> 52:43.673
<i>Okay. Thank you.</i>

52:45.643 --> 52:48.810
I think we should have the plastic
made into permanent covers.

52:48.812 --> 52:53.114
They say you can extend the life of your
combo by a couple of years if you--

52:54.250 --> 52:58.285
No more, Marcy. No more is no more.

52:58.287 --> 53:01.388
No more does not mean
more and more and more.

53:01.390 --> 53:03.723
No more means no more.

53:03.725 --> 53:06.892
Don't you understand? I am
doin' this for us, Charlie.

53:06.894 --> 53:09.895
All our goddamn money is left
locked up in this goddamn house!

53:09.897 --> 53:13.164
By the time they take the mortgage
payments out of my paycheck,

53:13.166 --> 53:15.833
there's not enough left to buy
you a fuckin' box of tampons!

53:15.835 --> 53:20.204
I am doin' the best that I know
how to make you a dream house.

53:20.206 --> 53:22.172
I want this for you.

53:22.174 --> 53:23.640
I can't afford a fuckin' dream house!

53:23.642 --> 53:25.775
But-- But--
I can't afford it.

53:25.777 --> 53:28.644
You got it? All you ever do is
yell about money, money, money!

53:28.646 --> 53:31.313
Don't you care--
Oh!

53:32.649 --> 53:34.281
I'm sorry.

53:34.283 --> 53:37.150
<i>Charlie, do you know something?</i>

53:37.152 --> 53:40.520
All I ever do is try to make you happy.

53:40.522 --> 53:42.421
I'm sorry.

54:02.942 --> 54:05.175
<i>What's on your mind, Charlie?</i>

54:08.680 --> 54:10.546
You still workin' on that deal?

54:11.582 --> 54:14.449
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

54:14.451 --> 54:17.919
I just wanna say I'm open. That's all.

54:17.921 --> 54:20.788
I'm open. <i>All right.</i>

54:22.391 --> 54:25.257
I tried to sit you on the
right horse from the start.

54:27.628 --> 54:29.494
Why'd you make it so rough?

54:31.231 --> 54:32.763
Don't matter, does it?

54:38.302 --> 54:41.202
No. Whatever your reasons are,
I respect them.

54:45.942 --> 54:48.342
This here is the drop house.

55:02.356 --> 55:03.888
<i>J.J.?</i>

55:05.524 --> 55:08.725
Hey!

55:08.727 --> 55:12.795
Hey, J.J. Got a message from Manuel.
You got a load comin' over?

55:14.799 --> 55:17.366
Who the hell's that?

55:17.368 --> 55:21.470
This here is Charlie Smith, J.J.
Charlie's my partner now.

55:21.472 --> 55:23.472
Where ya from, boy?

55:23.474 --> 55:26.241
California.

55:26.243 --> 55:28.710
California! Shit,
I used to work out there

55:28.712 --> 55:31.946
durin' the war in them shipyards.

55:31.948 --> 55:37.318
The whole time I was out there I never met
anybody that was worth a pinch of shit.

55:37.320 --> 55:40.287
They're a bunch of scum-suckin' dogs.
Come on. Lay off.

55:40.289 --> 55:42.989
I ain't kiddin' ya.
I'd go down there and...

55:42.991 --> 55:46.692
hold my nose and put
a double rubber on my dick...

55:46.694 --> 55:49.661
<i>and fuck all those
dockside whores down there.</i>

55:49.663 --> 55:51.696
<i>Likely as not, uh...</i>

55:53.933 --> 55:55.933
...I mighta knowed your mother, sonny.

56:01.473 --> 56:04.607
Just a teeny little push, that's all.

56:04.609 --> 56:07.610
Just a teeny little push.

56:07.612 --> 56:10.913
<i>Guess we caught J.J.
with a wild hair up his ass.</i>

56:10.915 --> 56:13.015
Come on, Charlie. Wait outside.

56:13.017 --> 56:15.417
Wait outside while we talk.
It's okay. Come on.

56:15.419 --> 56:19.020
All right. Okay. Fine.

56:24.860 --> 56:27.060
Put that fuckin' gun away.

56:27.062 --> 56:30.396
Where do you come off pullin'
that kind of shit anyway?

56:30.398 --> 56:32.564
I'm gonna tell you somethin'.

56:32.566 --> 56:34.999
I can tell by the way that guy
looks through his face that

56:35.001 --> 56:37.468
he's crazier than a shithouse rat.

56:48.513 --> 56:51.380
If you really need that boy,

56:51.382 --> 56:54.849
you oughtta put a collar on him and
make sure he don't get outta the yard.

56:57.820 --> 57:00.353
What the hell do you think this is?

57:00.355 --> 57:03.956
That's just money, boy.
That's all that is.

57:03.958 --> 57:05.958
That ain't enough.

57:09.363 --> 57:11.596
I want you to meet Bonnie and Alice.

57:11.598 --> 57:13.531
Hi. Nice to meet ya. How ya doin'?

57:13.533 --> 57:15.533
Would you hurry up? What?

57:15.535 --> 57:17.902
Hurry up!

57:17.904 --> 57:20.404
My new girlfriend, Angie.
Hi, Angie. Nice to see you.

57:28.112 --> 57:32.481
Daddy. Come on, Daddy!

57:32.483 --> 57:35.517
Hey, Charlie. Hey, when are
them coals gonna be ready?

57:35.519 --> 57:38.019
Hell, I'm so damn hungry
I could eat fried pig shit.

57:41.924 --> 57:44.457
...in a nice, sweet, sultry voice.

57:55.735 --> 58:00.204
...like how an electric toothbrush
can revitalize your sex life.

58:00.206 --> 58:02.606
We'd have the best damn show on TV.

58:05.944 --> 58:08.778
Savannah, I want you to take Timmy home.
You take him.

58:08.780 --> 58:10.646
You're drunk.

58:10.648 --> 58:13.815
Well, I'm just rememberin'
how much you hate scenes.

58:13.817 --> 58:15.950
So don't be jerkin' my reins.

58:20.789 --> 58:22.955
You need a hand?

58:22.957 --> 58:26.224
I thought I might... help you
skewer a while. No, I'm just--

58:26.226 --> 58:28.759
Honey, could you hurry up?
They're really getting hungry.

58:28.761 --> 58:32.162
Don't be pickin' on Charlie. He's doin'
a fine job, and I'm helpin' him.

58:32.164 --> 58:34.230
See?

58:34.232 --> 58:37.566
Yeah, well, we're running out of
dip-- of everything, you know?

58:37.568 --> 58:42.003
Well, hell, if they're that hungry,
we might as well feed 'em right now.

58:43.740 --> 58:46.707
Well, goddamn, girl. You wanna
party, you got a party.

58:55.250 --> 58:58.918
<i>Whoa! Ho-ho-ho-ho! Charlie, do something!</i>

58:58.920 --> 59:01.286
The meat is on fire!

59:04.090 --> 59:06.090
Charlie, please do something, goddamn it!

59:09.528 --> 59:11.127
<i>Charlie, do something!</i>

59:15.566 --> 59:17.699
Soup's on.

59:22.605 --> 59:24.972
- Cat to Charlie.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

59:26.642 --> 59:29.776
I got a blue pickup...
with a top over the bed,

59:29.778 --> 59:31.878
just picked up nine or ten.

59:31.880 --> 59:33.779
Get after 'em, my boy.

01:00:03.576 --> 01:00:06.577
Out. Spread.

01:00:06.579 --> 01:00:10.013
Well, I guess you got me, huh?
Yeah, I guess I did.

01:00:10.015 --> 01:00:12.215
Bajense, amigos. Todos.

01:00:14.085 --> 01:00:16.785
La linea. La linea.

01:00:16.787 --> 01:00:18.787
Thank you.

01:00:22.658 --> 01:00:24.924
Well, look here.

01:00:24.926 --> 01:00:26.792
Nice work, Charlie.

01:00:26.794 --> 01:00:30.095
This old boy and his amigos must
be runnin' ten loads a week.

01:00:30.097 --> 01:00:34.132
I don't know nothin', man. It's
just work for me. Oh, yeah, I know.

01:00:34.134 --> 01:00:36.968
Yeah. I'll take it from here.

01:00:36.970 --> 01:00:41.005
Where you takin' him? <i>Back to the station.
You take care of the Wets.</i>

01:00:48.614 --> 01:00:50.981
<i>Transportation's right behind me.</i>

01:01:09.167 --> 01:01:13.102
Fuera del carro, seores. Let me tell
ya, this has been one hell of a day.

01:01:13.104 --> 01:01:14.970
What?

01:01:14.972 --> 01:01:17.672
This is my fourth load since I came in.

01:01:20.977 --> 01:01:23.177
<i>Tules along the river were full of 'em.</i>

01:01:23.179 --> 01:01:26.046
<i>If they paid us by the head,
we'd all be millionaires.</i>

01:01:27.215 --> 01:01:29.315
Got it? I got it, Stan.

01:01:31.719 --> 01:01:33.218
<i>Well, take it easy, Charlie.</i>

01:02:17.291 --> 01:02:20.125
Partner, how we doin'?

01:02:20.127 --> 01:02:22.961
I ain't in this for murder. You hear me?

01:02:22.963 --> 01:02:25.296
No way that I'm in this for murder.

01:02:25.298 --> 01:02:27.298
Easy, Charlie. Calm down.
You're killin' drivers.

01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:30.334
And don't tell me I don't know
what I'm talkin' about!

01:02:30.336 --> 01:02:34.137
'Cause if I don't, where's the driver
you took in today? He ain't in <i>there</i>!

01:02:34.139 --> 01:02:37.807
And he ain't in there! So where
the fuck is he? He pulled a gun.

01:02:37.809 --> 01:02:40.209
Oh, he didn't have
no fuckin' gun! He sure did.

01:02:40.211 --> 01:02:42.411
You fuckin' missed it! Ah, bullshit!

01:02:42.413 --> 01:02:45.447
That old boy near got me, 'cause you
didn't fuckin' search him good!

01:02:45.449 --> 01:02:48.349
Don't bullshit me!

01:02:48.351 --> 01:02:51.418
Listen, Charlie, you're all steamed up.
Now calm down.

01:02:51.420 --> 01:02:55.789
Listen to me. I'm sure you can appreciate
somethin'. We got a business situation here.

01:02:55.791 --> 01:02:58.792
These independents get too big,
that comes out of our end.

01:02:58.794 --> 01:03:01.928
- So, what, you just fuckin' kill 'em?
- We take care of business.

01:03:01.930 --> 01:03:04.330
That's all we do.
We take care of business.

01:03:04.332 --> 01:03:07.132
You see this fuckin' line? This
line right here I don't cross!

01:03:07.134 --> 01:03:09.334
This fuckin' line right here!

01:03:09.336 --> 01:03:12.970
Listen, you asked me to let you in. I
ain't exactly payin' you dog-squeeze.

01:03:12.972 --> 01:03:15.973
<i>I don't care about
your money! You took it!</i>

01:03:15.975 --> 01:03:20.777
Your life is gonna be fly shit before I ever
get involved in murder! You understand?

01:03:20.779 --> 01:03:23.246
Do ya? Okay. Okay.

01:03:23.248 --> 01:03:25.381
I can respect that.

01:03:25.383 --> 01:03:28.751
Seriously, I can respect that.
Now, now, now I know.

01:03:29.854 --> 01:03:32.754
Now you know. Jesus Christ.

01:03:37.994 --> 01:03:41.128
There's times when I feel like there's
a whole other person in there.

01:03:41.130 --> 01:03:44.064
He just isn't the Charlie
Smith that I married.

01:03:44.066 --> 01:03:46.499
Oh, they've all got their secret sides.

01:03:46.501 --> 01:03:48.934
<i>Thelma's ready for you. Okay.</i>

01:03:51.905 --> 01:03:54.272
The other night after dinner

01:03:54.274 --> 01:03:58.142
he went around the house
and looked at the Nu-Vue...

01:03:58.144 --> 01:04:00.978
and everything,
and he turned to me and said,

01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:05.282
"Marcy, what the hell are we doing here?
What the hell is the point?"

01:04:05.284 --> 01:04:07.284
The point? Yeah.

01:04:07.286 --> 01:04:11.121
And I said, "The point is,
honey, that we're happy."

01:04:11.123 --> 01:04:14.424
And he looked at me... real funny,

01:04:14.426 --> 01:04:18.494
sort of sad like...

01:04:18.496 --> 01:04:22.864
and he said, "So this is all
it takes to make you happy."

01:04:24.434 --> 01:04:27.301
And I felt real scared, Savannah.

01:04:27.303 --> 01:04:31.371
He was standing right there in the
room with me, and... I felt all alone.

01:04:31.373 --> 01:04:34.107
Oh, honey, I wouldn't worry about it.

01:04:34.109 --> 01:04:39.178
You just keep that sweet thing buttered up.
He's not gonna wander too far from home.

01:05:12.945 --> 01:05:15.445
You know what?

01:05:15.447 --> 01:05:17.313
You look like my husband.

01:05:19.417 --> 01:05:23.084
He'd fuck a woodpile if he
thought there was a snake in it.

01:05:25.221 --> 01:05:27.921
Well, I've fucked
a woodpile or two myself.

01:05:29.157 --> 01:05:31.190
I bet you have.

01:05:41.902 --> 01:05:43.968
Well...

01:05:43.970 --> 01:05:46.003
it doesn't really matter, does it?

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:51.941
I read somewhere in a poem that
everything is just a dream.

01:05:54.378 --> 01:05:56.111
Whose dream is it?

01:05:57.481 --> 01:05:59.547
I don't know who's dreaming.

01:06:02.251 --> 01:06:04.284
Well, then it doesn't matter, does it?

01:06:11.225 --> 01:06:12.591
Guess not.

01:06:22.202 --> 01:06:24.502
Motherfucker.

01:06:24.504 --> 01:06:26.237
Juan!

01:06:30.576 --> 01:06:32.909
Do you remember me? Yeah.

01:06:32.911 --> 01:06:34.977
How you doin'? Okay.

01:06:36.547 --> 01:06:38.914
Where'd you get the sneakers?

01:06:38.916 --> 01:06:40.615
Same place I get this watch.

01:06:42.352 --> 01:06:44.919
You boostin' now? <i>Only work for money.</i>

01:06:44.921 --> 01:06:47.054
<i>Comprende? Si.</i>

01:06:47.056 --> 01:06:49.923
Donde esta su hermana?

01:06:49.925 --> 01:06:52.958
<i>Busca a mi hermana? Cinco dolares.</i>

01:06:54.328 --> 01:06:57.228
<i>Cinco dolares.</i>

01:07:04.170 --> 01:07:06.203
<i>Cinco dolares. Vamos.</i>

01:07:44.037 --> 01:07:45.703
She don't wanna work here. Why?

01:07:45.705 --> 01:07:48.038
She have to earn money, get baby.

01:08:06.389 --> 01:08:09.123
What's the matter
with the baby? Is it sick?

01:08:09.125 --> 01:08:11.391
Esta enfermo el nio?

01:08:11.393 --> 01:08:15.628
No, they took the baby. She have
to earn money or no give back.

01:08:15.630 --> 01:08:20.064
Hiya, Charlie. Como estas, amigo?

01:08:20.067 --> 01:08:24.368
What would you like? Cerveza? Tequila?

01:08:24.371 --> 01:08:29.273
How about some whiskey? Anything you
want and it's yours on the house, free.

01:08:29.274 --> 01:08:32.042
I came over to talk to one of the girls.

01:08:32.044 --> 01:08:37.479
Oh, you want some pussy. Pick one
you like. She's yours for nothing.

01:08:37.482 --> 01:08:41.417
I'll talk to this one.

01:08:41.419 --> 01:08:44.219
<i>Esta?</i>

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:47.622
Nil, Charlie. She's only
good for go-go dancing.

01:08:47.625 --> 01:08:49.591
We got some girls you're
really gonna like.

01:08:49.593 --> 01:08:52.594
Come on. I got some really
fine pussy for you.

01:08:55.731 --> 01:08:58.865
<i>Que le paso a tu nino?
El nino me lo robaron.</i>

01:08:58.868 --> 01:09:02.603
<i>Esta zafada. She's crazy, man.</i>

01:09:05.774 --> 01:09:08.441
Come on. I'll take you outta
here right now. Senora?

01:09:13.714 --> 01:09:16.548
Understand? Anybody tries
to stop me, I'm gonna throw

01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:19.250
this fuckin' place into the street.

01:09:20.386 --> 01:09:21.585
<i>Por favor.</i>

01:09:25.857 --> 01:09:28.724
You want her? You can have her.

01:09:33.464 --> 01:09:35.930
Stop it! Sueltenlo!

01:10:03.925 --> 01:10:07.459
Me estan volviendo loco. Mujeres bonitas!

01:10:16.369 --> 01:10:17.735
Say, senor!

01:10:20.239 --> 01:10:22.739
<i>Ay, que chulo. Ven aca.</i>

01:10:22.741 --> 01:10:24.407
Hey. Hey.

01:10:24.409 --> 01:10:26.609
Hey, gringo!

01:10:26.611 --> 01:10:30.779
<i>Hey, take me home, huh? Take me home.</i>

01:10:37.454 --> 01:10:39.887
<i>Hey, amigo!</i>

01:10:52.533 --> 01:10:55.634
Feel his mouth. Come on now, Tim.
You're not feelin' his mouth.

01:10:55.636 --> 01:10:59.337
That guy, you know, Charlie?
Jesus, he's all weirded out.

01:10:59.339 --> 01:11:03.240
I know. He went after
that girl with that baby.

01:11:03.242 --> 01:11:05.709
Don't worry about it. We've
gotta do something with him.

01:11:05.711 --> 01:11:09.245
He can put us all in the shitter.
I know what to do.

01:11:09.247 --> 01:11:12.281
Get your heel down! I'm telling
you, he's gonna be trouble.

01:11:12.283 --> 01:11:13.882
I'm gonna stick ol' Charlie
so deep in my pocket they're

01:11:13.884 --> 01:11:16.651
gonna have to pipe light in him.

01:11:16.653 --> 01:11:18.986
That's great!

01:13:08.927 --> 01:13:12.862
<i>Que esta pasando aqui? No te preocupes.
Es de un amigo.</i>

01:13:12.864 --> 01:13:15.798
<i>Hay que ir por usted? En una hora.</i>

01:13:54.536 --> 01:13:56.602
Hey, Charlie, that kid
you got today, that driver-

01:13:56.604 --> 01:13:59.504
- How many Wets that sucker have?

01:13:59.506 --> 01:14:03.106
None. Yeah, well, it says here he had two.
Two for San Antone.

01:14:05.610 --> 01:14:07.743
Who typed this up? Honk.

01:14:10.147 --> 01:14:13.014
Then Honk fucked up.

01:14:13.016 --> 01:14:16.550
I just talked to him.
That's what the kid told him.

01:14:16.552 --> 01:14:19.019
I mean, you did look in the van?

01:14:19.021 --> 01:14:21.187
Yeah, I looked in the van.

01:14:21.189 --> 01:14:23.889
Did you look in them windows?
Sometimes them suckers...

01:14:23.891 --> 01:14:27.025
are hunkered down there pretty
low you can't hardly see 'em.

01:14:27.027 --> 01:14:30.895
I know how they sit. Honk confused
my driver with another driver.

01:14:30.897 --> 01:14:34.098
Van was empty.

01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:36.500
We only caught one driver today, Charlie.

01:14:36.502 --> 01:14:40.837
Hey, Beef, if Charlie says the van was
empty, the van was empty. Write it up again.

01:14:40.839 --> 01:14:44.774
<i>Kid was probably stoned
or boozed or somethin'.</i>

01:14:44.776 --> 01:14:49.011
Heck, can you imagine if he had made San
Antone? He opens the door and no one's there.

01:14:49.013 --> 01:14:50.879
<i>Hey, Charlie. How's it goin'?</i>

01:15:49.603 --> 01:15:51.603
Here. Huh?

01:16:10.056 --> 01:16:13.257
What are you waitin' for?

01:16:13.259 --> 01:16:17.628
I looked. I'm tellin' ya, I looked.
Come off it, Charlie.

01:16:17.630 --> 01:16:20.931
I looked, goddamn it, and there wasn't
no fuckin' Wets in that fuckin' truck!

01:16:20.933 --> 01:16:24.935
All right, you keep on tellin' yourself
whatever it is you wanna believe! All right?

01:16:24.937 --> 01:16:27.904
But it ain't gonna change the
fact there's a pair of Wets...

01:16:27.906 --> 01:16:30.039
in the back of that goddamn van!

01:16:30.041 --> 01:16:32.241
Now you listen up, Charlie.

01:16:32.243 --> 01:16:36.044
I'm gonna cover you on this, but from
now on, you do exactly like I say.

01:16:36.046 --> 01:16:39.080
If I say a pissant could
haul a bale o' cotton,

01:16:39.082 --> 01:16:42.249
you don't question me--
you just hitch that fucker up!

01:16:42.251 --> 01:16:45.318
Now you go ahead and push them
pepper bellies in that goddamn hole!

01:16:48.856 --> 01:16:50.856
What's wrong now?

01:16:50.858 --> 01:16:53.925
Is somethin' wrong now? No, nothin'.

01:17:34.133 --> 01:17:36.766
Charlie!

01:17:36.768 --> 01:17:39.235
<i>Honey, what are you sitting there for?</i>

01:17:41.038 --> 01:17:43.138
<i>Charlie, what's the matter?</i>

01:17:45.275 --> 01:17:47.975
Oh, God, honey, you look exhausted.
What is it?

01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:53.613
It's all right.

01:17:55.683 --> 01:17:58.050
I love you. I love you.

01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:41.992
Juan.

01:18:44.863 --> 01:18:46.729
I wanna see your sister.

01:18:50.401 --> 01:18:53.101
Gonna take you both across.

01:18:53.103 --> 01:18:55.136
I wanna go to Chicago.

01:18:56.372 --> 01:18:59.239
Chicago.

01:18:59.241 --> 01:19:01.941
Just take me to your sister. Okay, <i>migra.</i>

01:19:09.950 --> 01:19:11.316
<i>Entre para adentro.</i>

01:19:20.460 --> 01:19:22.092
<i>Andale.</i>

01:19:22.094 --> 01:19:24.861
<i>No.</i>

01:19:34.271 --> 01:19:37.138
<i>Dice la migra que nos ayuda
a pasar al otro lado.</i>

01:19:41.244 --> 01:19:44.712
<i>No hay dinero. Dile que no tenemos nada.</i>

01:19:44.714 --> 01:19:47.081
<i>Te doy dinero.</i>

01:19:48.317 --> 01:19:50.717
This is the address of the coyote.

01:19:52.754 --> 01:19:55.488
<i>Direccion del coyote.</i>

01:19:56.457 --> 01:20:01.026
Llevale este dinero.

01:20:05.198 --> 01:20:07.831
Manana pueden cruzar...

01:20:09.334 --> 01:20:11.834
a Estados Unidos.

01:20:14.171 --> 01:20:15.904
<i>Vete, Juan.</i>

01:20:35.792 --> 01:20:40.260
No, no, no, no, no, no. No, senora. No.

01:20:41.763 --> 01:20:43.496
You don't owe me anything.

01:20:43.498 --> 01:20:48.334
<i>Por que me ayuda? Por que?</i>

01:20:48.336 --> 01:20:50.769
Por que?

01:20:52.339 --> 01:20:55.206
I wanna feel good
about something sometime.

01:20:57.944 --> 01:21:03.147
<i>And, uh, 'cause you have to find
your kid, and you can't do it alone.</i>

01:21:06.919 --> 01:21:09.085
You don't understand
anything I'm saying, do you?

01:21:11.122 --> 01:21:13.122
<i>No comprende?</i>

01:21:13.124 --> 01:21:16.125
No.

01:21:16.127 --> 01:21:18.494
<i>Estara bien.</i> Uh--

01:21:20.464 --> 01:21:24.064
<i>Manana cruzan...</i>

01:21:26.001 --> 01:21:28.067
<i>a los Estados Unidos.</i>

01:21:33.841 --> 01:21:35.207
<i>Gracias.</i>

01:21:43.950 --> 01:21:47.051
Readin' large group headin' W-14.

01:21:47.053 --> 01:21:50.287
I guess that's our sector.

01:21:50.289 --> 01:21:52.489
See ya later. Yeah.

01:23:55.102 --> 01:23:57.001
<i>Alto! Alto!</i>

01:24:02.674 --> 01:24:05.007
- Freeze!
- Hey!

01:24:05.009 --> 01:24:06.508
<i>Come on.</i> Andale.

01:24:13.483 --> 01:24:15.483
Venganse. Ahora, si.

01:25:16.810 --> 01:25:18.509
Have they arrived yet?

01:25:20.846 --> 01:25:23.646
The Wets'll be comin' along pretty soon.

01:25:23.648 --> 01:25:26.548
<i>Orale! Pronto!</i>

01:25:35.458 --> 01:25:37.458
Orale!

01:25:37.460 --> 01:25:38.826
<i>Pronto!</i>

01:26:02.885 --> 01:26:05.886
This is your shit bucket, folks.

01:26:05.888 --> 01:26:07.621
This is the paper.

01:26:30.211 --> 01:26:31.910
Charlie.

01:26:35.515 --> 01:26:37.281
Suban!

01:26:37.283 --> 01:26:38.582
Vamonos! Arriba!

Vamonos. Arriba.

Vamonos. Arriba.

Que pasa? Sueltame!

01:26:58.967 --> 01:27:00.766
<i>Boys pulled these out.
You wanna check 'em?</i>

01:27:00.768 --> 01:27:02.501
I sure do.

01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:16.646
Hold that fucker!

01:27:16.648 --> 01:27:20.383
What've you got here, boy?

01:27:20.385 --> 01:27:23.219
Well, I'll be goddamn. What

01:27:23.221 --> 01:27:25.854
Wearin' panty hose.
A little dope in there, huh?

01:27:25.856 --> 01:27:28.356
I'll be a son of a gun. What do you got?

01:27:28.358 --> 01:27:30.991
The same goddamn thing.
Take 'em on in the shed.

01:27:30.993 --> 01:27:34.494
<i>- Andale! Andale!
- Que pasa?</i>

01:27:36.664 --> 01:27:38.296
<i>Alejandro!</i>

01:27:56.379 --> 01:27:58.278
See that? <i>Yeah!</i>

01:27:59.581 --> 01:28:01.447
Shit, let's take a look.

01:28:07.020 --> 01:28:09.553
DBC-4 Patrol.

01:28:09.555 --> 01:28:11.755
Spacious furniture truck on Highway 23.

01:28:11.757 --> 01:28:14.424
Giving chase six miles east--

01:28:14.426 --> 01:28:19.028
That's <i>our</i> truck. Fuck it. Why should
w <i> e</i> g <i> ive a shit? We delivered.</i>

01:29:08.944 --> 01:29:11.544
Pursuin' a truck east of Highway 23.

01:29:14.448 --> 01:29:16.014
DBC Unit number nine--

01:29:20.786 --> 01:29:21.985
Here we go! Come on!

01:30:30.484 --> 01:30:33.918
Hey, come on over here.
Bring it up here. Pick it up!

01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:36.820
Pick it up.

01:30:41.526 --> 01:30:45.427
<i>Estas bien? Si. Si.</i>

01:30:45.429 --> 01:30:46.928
Si? Si.

01:30:48.398 --> 01:30:51.031
I've gotta get back here.

01:30:51.033 --> 01:30:52.732
Donde esta Juan?

01:30:52.734 --> 01:30:54.767
Lo dejaron en el d <i> rop house.</i>

01:30:54.769 --> 01:30:57.703
...visit the gas pumps. Well,
you just do-si-do on over to--

01:30:57.705 --> 01:31:00.739
Hi, hon. Hi.

01:31:00.741 --> 01:31:03.675
<i>- Es mi esposa.
- We have the largest selection of--</i>

01:31:03.677 --> 01:31:06.010
Charlie, what's going on here?

01:31:06.012 --> 01:31:08.679
This girl's been in an accident, Marcy.

01:31:08.681 --> 01:31:10.714
Well, I'll call an ambulance.

01:31:10.716 --> 01:31:15.185
No, no, no, don't call an ambulance. She
has to stay here. I'm gonna go back.

01:31:15.187 --> 01:31:18.021
Todo esta bien...or a four-wheel drive--

01:31:18.023 --> 01:31:20.590
Voy por Juan. Who's Juan?

01:31:39.177 --> 01:31:41.510
Would you please
explain to me what's going on?

01:31:41.512 --> 01:31:44.212
Marcy, not now. Just not right now, okay?

01:31:44.214 --> 01:31:46.047
But, Charlie, would ya--

01:31:46.049 --> 01:31:48.883
Help the girl out, Marcy.
Give her a drink.

01:31:48.885 --> 01:31:50.784
<i>He said...</i>

01:31:52.754 --> 01:31:54.987
<i>"I know you shot my brother."</i>

01:31:56.924 --> 01:31:59.457
<i>Brandon was my brother, Connie.</i>

01:31:59.459 --> 01:32:02.893
Um, would you like an aspirin? <i>Oh, my God.
I had an affair with Brandon.</i>

01:32:46.237 --> 01:32:49.271
How come that goddamn truck got busted?

01:32:49.273 --> 01:32:54.241
J.J., the truck got busted because
two honest border patrolmen...

01:32:54.243 --> 01:32:56.977
were out doin' their duty.

01:32:56.979 --> 01:33:00.847
Now I ain't got no control over that, and
that's gonna happen every now and then.

01:33:00.849 --> 01:33:02.515
Don't you see that?

01:33:02.517 --> 01:33:06.118
I can't have the whole
goddamn sector on the take.

01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:09.121
Jesus Christ, man. I don't--

01:33:09.123 --> 01:33:12.124
I'm gonna tell you somethin'-- I
don't care how you handle it,

01:33:12.126 --> 01:33:16.294
but you know, on that last load
we got screwed out of 25 percent.

01:33:16.296 --> 01:33:19.963
Twenty-five percent of
one load, J.J., is peanuts!

01:33:21.666 --> 01:33:23.866
You think you got expenses?

01:33:23.868 --> 01:33:26.969
Hell, come up to my house every weekend.
The whole damn place is--

01:33:26.971 --> 01:33:29.538
Hold it right there. Don't move.

01:33:31.174 --> 01:33:33.207
All right, up! Easy.

01:33:35.844 --> 01:33:38.544
Put that goddamn gun away, Smith.

01:33:38.546 --> 01:33:40.546
Shit, Red!

01:33:40.548 --> 01:33:42.648
What do you want, boy?

01:33:42.650 --> 01:33:44.683
I'm lookin' for that kid
you took off the truck.

01:33:44.685 --> 01:33:48.820
That little wetback has already
hauled ass back to Mexico.

01:33:48.822 --> 01:33:52.223
<i>Demonstrators-- Your foot,
uh, is it better?</i>

01:33:52.225 --> 01:33:55.960
<i>Es mejor? Si esta mejor. Gracias.</i>

01:33:55.962 --> 01:33:59.596
Good. to protest the removal
of squatters in the city--

01:34:01.967 --> 01:34:04.701
...about two hours after
vandalism, public harassment...

01:34:04.703 --> 01:34:07.170
and obstruction of traffic,
the group dispersed--

01:34:07.172 --> 01:34:09.705
Charlie, where have you been? Maria,

01:34:09.707 --> 01:34:12.708
<i>tenemos que regresar a Mexico.</i>

01:34:12.710 --> 01:34:15.210
<i>Charlie, what's going on?
I don't understand.</i>

01:34:15.212 --> 01:34:17.712
Her brother's on the other side.
I'm taking her back.

01:34:17.714 --> 01:34:20.748
And you're going
with her? But-- I'll be back.

01:34:20.750 --> 01:34:23.617
<i>Mexico cannot legally evict--</i>

01:34:23.619 --> 01:34:26.152
Charlie, what, what is your
relationship with this girl?

01:34:26.154 --> 01:34:29.088
Marcy, will ya quit it?
You don't have to do this now.

01:34:29.090 --> 01:34:31.623
Charlie, you're leaving
with her, aren't you?

01:34:31.625 --> 01:34:34.292
Marcy, I'm gonna be right back.

01:34:34.294 --> 01:34:37.928
B-But, Charlie, what, what
are you d-doing with her?

01:34:37.930 --> 01:34:40.196
Charlie, I have a right to know.

01:34:42.333 --> 01:34:45.033
Charlie? Charlie, please don't go.

01:34:45.035 --> 01:34:48.102
You don't have to do this. I'm gonna
be right back. Charlie, please.

01:34:48.104 --> 01:34:50.104
Charlie, please! Ow! Goddamn it.

01:34:50.106 --> 01:34:52.306
Charlie.

01:34:52.308 --> 01:34:55.776
Charlie, please don't go. What am I
gonna do without you? Be right back.

01:34:55.778 --> 01:34:57.944
Charlie, please don't go!

01:35:12.059 --> 01:35:15.126
Dios mio! Juan!

01:35:15.128 --> 01:35:17.995
<i>Necesita un doctor! Juan!</i>

01:35:17.997 --> 01:35:19.796
Juan.

01:35:21.666 --> 01:35:23.666
Juan.

01:35:23.668 --> 01:35:26.034
Ay, Dios mio, que hago? Juan!

01:35:29.739 --> 01:35:30.971
Ay!

01:35:32.774 --> 01:35:34.673
Ay, Juan!

01:35:39.045 --> 01:35:40.077
Juan.

01:35:42.714 --> 01:35:43.979
Juan!

01:36:05.668 --> 01:36:08.802
<i>Dios te salve, Maria. Llena eres
de gracia. El Senor es contigo.</i>

01:36:08.804 --> 01:36:11.805
Bendita tu eres entre todas las

01:36:11.807 --> 01:36:14.707
mujeres y bendito el
fruto de vientre, Jesus. Amen.

01:36:14.709 --> 01:36:17.309
<i>Padre nuestro que estas en el
cielo, santificado sea tu nombre.</i>

01:36:17.311 --> 01:36:20.078
Venga a nos tu reino.
Hagase, Senor, tu voluntad...

01:36:35.459 --> 01:36:37.959
<i>Dios te salve, Maria. Llena eres
de gracia. El Senor es contigo.</i>

01:36:37.961 --> 01:36:39.727
<i>Bendita tu eres entre todas las mujeres--</i>

01:36:39.729 --> 01:36:43.764
<i>Oiga No conoce a una senora--</i>

01:36:43.766 --> 01:36:47.033
<i>Santa Maria, madre de Dios, ruega
por nosotros los pecadores,</i>

01:36:47.035 --> 01:36:49.803
<i>ahora y en la hora
de nuestra muerte. Amen.</i>

01:36:49.805 --> 01:36:52.472
<i>Y bendito el fruto de
tu vientre, Jesus. Amen.</i>

01:36:52.474 --> 01:36:54.907
Tiene un hermano--

01:36:54.909 --> 01:36:58.510
<i>Abajo, Maria! Quedate. Quedate.</i>

01:37:41.449 --> 01:37:43.048
Charlie!

01:37:48.288 --> 01:37:50.021
Charlie!

01:38:11.977 --> 01:38:14.309
<i>Who'd you sell the baby to?</i>

01:38:16.513 --> 01:38:19.547
I can take you to him.

01:38:19.549 --> 01:38:22.049
We haven't sold him yet.

01:38:22.051 --> 01:38:25.919
He's okay. The baby's okay.

01:38:25.921 --> 01:38:28.922
I was waiting for a good home for him.

01:38:28.924 --> 01:38:31.124
Charlie...

01:38:31.126 --> 01:38:36.328
rich people pay 25 grand
for a baby like that.

01:38:38.465 --> 01:38:42.333
You and me, we could cut a deal.

01:38:48.140 --> 01:38:49.506
Let's go.

01:39:47.363 --> 01:39:52.733
Hola. Hola! Abre la puerta.

01:39:54.236 --> 01:39:56.402
- Nobody home.
- Get back.

01:42:40.192 --> 01:42:42.358
Hit it!

01:43:29.271 --> 01:43:30.870
Charlie!

01:43:36.743 --> 01:43:39.309
I can't believe we couldn't
work somethin' out.

01:44:02.666 --> 01:44:03.898
<i>Miren!</i>

01:44:47.774 --> 01:44:48.973
<i>Mi hijo!</i>

01:44:56.449 --> 01:44:58.348
<i>Gracias.</i>

01:44:59.918 --> 01:45:02.285
<i>Gracias.</i>

01:45:02.287 --> 01:45:04.320
Oh!
