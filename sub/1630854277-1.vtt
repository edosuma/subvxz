in the year 2000.

16:30.948 --> 16:33.867
- It was the crackling energy
of something might happen.

16:33.951 --> 16:36.412
But you don't think
that Jeremy Lin's

16:36.495 --> 16:39.873
gonna be the guy to knock out
Kobe and the Lakers.

16:39.957 --> 16:41.792
- This is peak Lakers.

16:41.875 --> 16:43.085
They still had Metta.

16:43.168 --> 16:44.420
They still had Pau.

16:44.503 --> 16:45.713
They still had Kobe.

16:45.796 --> 16:47.589
- The Lakers came in
with the idea

16:47.673 --> 16:50.092
that "Nah, like,
not on our watch.

16:50.175 --> 16:52.469
We gonna end this fairy tale,
and we gonna end it tonight."

16:52.553 --> 16:56.557
- Kobe in an interview gave Lin
some gas and said some shit.

16:56.640 --> 16:58.100
- Are you surprised
at the production

16:58.183 --> 16:59.601
that Lin's had over
the past week?

16:59.685 --> 17:01.603
- I don't even know
what he's done.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.564
Like, I don't--I have no idea

17:03.647 --> 17:04.565
what you guys
are talking about.

17:04.648 --> 17:06.066
- Would you consider
guarding him

17:06.150 --> 17:07.359
if he's having one
of those games?

17:07.443 --> 17:10.070
- Jesus Christ.
- [laughs]

17:10.154 --> 17:11.739
- I'm on the way to the game,

17:11.822 --> 17:14.783
and I see what Kobe said
about me,

17:14.867 --> 17:16.952
and I'm like, "Tonight,

17:17.035 --> 17:19.121
I'm just gonna be
hella aggressive."

17:19.204 --> 17:21.749
Like, no matter what happens,
50/50, like,

17:21.832 --> 17:23.584
if I have any space, like,
and I don't know what to do,

17:23.667 --> 17:24.793
I'm shooting it.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.837
- Though you're J-Lin
and we're rooting for you...

17:26.920 --> 17:29.631
[laughs] That's Kobe Bryant.

17:29.715 --> 17:32.968
- It's MJ, Kobe, and Bron.

17:33.051 --> 17:36.930
Anytime you have a opportunity
to play against these guys,

17:37.014 --> 17:38.474
it's a chance
to measure yourself.

17:38.557 --> 17:40.017
- He the closest thing
to Jordan.

17:40.100 --> 17:43.103
Like, if you hate him,
it's because he actually

17:43.187 --> 17:45.606
hits the shots Jordan hits
and did the hand,

17:45.689 --> 17:48.275
and it pissed you off
'cause you couldn't do it.

17:48.358 --> 17:51.278
Tonight, we get
to look the Mamba in the eye.

17:51.361 --> 17:54.406
- Jeremy Lin, what do you make
of the splash

17:54.490 --> 17:56.325
that he's made with the Knicks?
- I mean, it's great.

17:56.408 --> 17:59.077
It is the worst job
of talent evaluation

17:59.161 --> 18:02.247
that I've ever seen in my life
if this kid is this good.

18:02.331 --> 18:04.458
When you get that opportunity,
you have to kick the door in.

18:04.541 --> 18:05.667
Now he's not only kicked it
in.

18:05.751 --> 18:07.002
He blew it up.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.170
- But this, without question,

18:08.253 --> 18:10.422
the toughest test
for Jeremy Lin.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.007
- Jeremy,
in that boxing analogy,

18:12.090 --> 18:14.384
comes out of his corner,
and he's swinging.

18:14.468 --> 18:15.636
- Lin shot.

18:15.719 --> 18:17.513
[cheers and applause]

18:17.596 --> 18:21.350
- Jeremy has nine, ten points
in the first three minutes,

18:21.433 --> 18:24.019
and the Garden
is going apeshit!

18:24.102 --> 18:25.187
- I let my first few fly
on me.

18:25.270 --> 18:27.231
I have, like, four
or five field goal attempts

18:27.314 --> 18:28.857
within the first, like,
couple minutes.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.609
And I get hot.

18:30.692 --> 18:32.444
Okay, here we go.

18:32.528 --> 18:33.821
It's gonna be a long night
for them.

18:33.904 --> 18:36.490
- Lin drives in
and lays it in!

18:36.573 --> 18:40.577
- I just remember
how fast he was moving.

18:40.661 --> 18:41.620
He's going to the rim,

18:41.703 --> 18:43.705
and he's attacking
the rim hard.

18:43.789 --> 18:44.998
- This guy was driving.

18:45.082 --> 18:46.542
He was going past Kobe.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.585
- Jeremy just stepped up
to every moment,

18:48.669 --> 18:49.878
and he didn't back down.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.547
He hitting and-ones.
He's screaming.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.257
He pumpin' his fists
at the crowd.

18:53.340 --> 18:54.716
Like, he's living
in the moment.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.719
- Never relenting,
taking fallaway jumpers.

18:57.803 --> 19:01.390
Confident stuff that a kid
who had never played

19:01.473 --> 19:04.143
on this kind of a stage
should have.

19:04.226 --> 19:07.521
- This kid was like a video
game 'cause he's not supposed

19:07.604 --> 19:09.106
to be doing these things
that he's doing.

19:09.189 --> 19:10.566
- You know the video game
where you, like--

19:10.649 --> 19:12.901
a player's, like, tired,
and then you put somebody else

19:12.985 --> 19:14.153
in that's not tired,
and you like,

19:14.236 --> 19:15.654
"Oh, man, you don't even run
that fast.

19:15.737 --> 19:16.780
Like, what?"

19:16.864 --> 19:18.824
Like, I just remember seeing
J-Lin do that,

19:18.907 --> 19:20.200
and I'm like,
"I ain't never been part

19:20.284 --> 19:21.660
of no video game experience."

19:21.743 --> 19:24.288
- He did that crazy, like,
spin move against Derek Fisher

19:24.371 --> 19:25.581
and hit that perfect layup.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.165
- D. Fisher's a tough guard
too.

19:27.249 --> 19:28.542
- Lin likes the open floor.

19:28.625 --> 19:31.753
Spinning, puts it up,
and backs it in!

19:31.837 --> 19:33.881
- And I'm like,
"That's something new."

19:33.964 --> 19:37.759
- On the one hand, I'm like,
"Dude, I'm a frickin' problem.

19:37.843 --> 19:39.595
Derek Fisher cannot guard me."

19:39.678 --> 19:41.138
But on the other hand,
I'm like,

19:41.221 --> 19:42.306
"Yo, what just happened?"

19:42.389 --> 19:44.182
It felt like
an out-of-body experience.

19:44.266 --> 19:46.393
I never did that move
before that.

19:46.476 --> 19:47.394
[buzzer blares]

19:47.477 --> 19:49.104
- And that will end
the first half.

19:49.187 --> 19:51.565
Jeremy Lin was superb.

19:51.648 --> 19:52.900
- Man!
- I like his game.

19:52.983 --> 19:55.235
- And he got that Garden
buzzin' right now

19:55.319 --> 19:57.404
with that 360 move.

19:57.487 --> 19:58.655
Whoo.
- And right after that...

19:58.739 --> 20:00.490
- So at a halftime,
you figure, like,

20:00.574 --> 20:02.743
okay,
regression to the mean comes.

20:02.826 --> 20:04.411
Because it's the Lakers.
It's Kobe, right?

20:04.494 --> 20:07.039
These are guys
who have survived runs before.

20:07.122 --> 20:08.415
They've won championships.

20:08.498 --> 20:10.042
- I think our whole team knew

20:10.125 --> 20:13.629
in the second half
it was gonna be Kobe time.

20:13.712 --> 20:15.797
- Bryant spinning.
Difficult shot...

20:15.881 --> 20:18.258
[laughs] For some.
- Yeah.

20:18.342 --> 20:19.635
- Kobe just started to get hot

20:19.718 --> 20:24.139
and hit a lot of tough midrange
jumpers in that third quarter.

20:24.222 --> 20:25.974
And we could see
our lead dwindle,

20:26.058 --> 20:27.476
and dwindle, and dwindle.

20:27.559 --> 20:30.479
- But what's crazy about what
happens in the second half,

20:30.562 --> 20:32.773
Jeremy Lin
just keeps attacking.

20:32.856 --> 20:35.275
- I'm watching guys get
physical with him

20:35.359 --> 20:36.777
and I'm waiting for him
to back down

20:36.860 --> 20:39.112
or his moment to be over.

20:39.196 --> 20:42.199
- But Jeremy
just kept making shots.

20:42.282 --> 20:43.784
- Jeremy was cooking, okay?

20:43.867 --> 20:45.118
He was cooking motherfuckers.

20:45.202 --> 20:47.454
- He caught the ball
about 28 feet out,

20:47.537 --> 20:50.457
and he drilled it
on Pau Gasol.

20:50.540 --> 20:52.125
It was unbelievable.

20:52.209 --> 20:55.337
- Y'all wanna see
a little Manu step?

20:55.420 --> 20:57.464
Y'all want the reverse finish?

20:57.547 --> 20:59.257
Y'all want the inside finish?

20:59.341 --> 21:00.509
Y'all want the hook finish?

21:00.592 --> 21:03.220
He was giving y'all floaters.

21:03.303 --> 21:04.388
Man.

21:04.471 --> 21:05.389
- It was just surreal.

21:05.472 --> 21:07.516
Is this the other plot
of "Space Jam"?

21:07.599 --> 21:11.019
Like, whose superpowers
did Jeremy Lin steal

21:11.103 --> 21:13.230
to become the best basketball
player in the world?

21:13.313 --> 21:16.984
- My husband and I were
in my living room behind me

21:17.067 --> 21:19.403
standing up the entire time.

21:19.486 --> 21:22.364
And the guy
just couldn't miss.

21:22.447 --> 21:24.658
- We were like, "Oh!"
Like, I wanted to run around.

21:24.741 --> 21:26.159
I might have taken a few laps.

21:26.243 --> 21:27.619
I started tearing up.

21:27.703 --> 21:28.620
- And this is the part

21:28.704 --> 21:31.206
that still gives me
goose bumps.

21:31.289 --> 21:34.710
He knew what stage he was on.

21:34.793 --> 21:37.337
He knew that the cameras
were all there.

21:37.421 --> 21:39.047
He knew
that he had this chance

21:39.131 --> 21:40.799
to say something
that would change this

21:40.882 --> 21:44.386
from "Wow, cool little fluke"

21:44.469 --> 21:46.722
to "This is going
to be a legend

21:46.805 --> 21:49.057
that parents tell their kids
one day."

21:49.141 --> 21:50.225
- All the hype's around you

21:50.308 --> 21:52.060
'cause you're "Jeremy Lin"
right now,

21:52.144 --> 21:54.813
and everybody's like,
"I'ma be the one to stop him."

21:54.896 --> 21:58.650
And he gave all y'all
what y'all wanted to see.

21:58.734 --> 22:01.862
- There was a shot that I hit
that I knew was a dagger.

22:01.945 --> 22:04.948
Tyson hits the ball back
and then Shump ends up with it

22:05.032 --> 22:06.408
and he swings it to me
in a corner.

22:06.491 --> 22:08.660
And I got all the space
in the world.

22:08.744 --> 22:11.788
And as I shoot it, I'm like,
"Oh, that feels amazing."

22:11.872 --> 22:13.582
And it goes swish,
right through the net.

22:13.665 --> 22:16.626
It felt like we were hovering
'cause that's how loud

22:16.710 --> 22:19.421
and energetic it was,
and it was this magical moment.

22:19.504 --> 22:21.590
I've never experienced
something like that

22:21.673 --> 22:23.216
before or after.

22:23.300 --> 22:26.386
- Linsanity continues here
at Madison Square Garden...

22:26.470 --> 22:28.805
[buzzer blares]
As the undrafted point guard

22:28.889 --> 22:32.934
from Harvard
electrifies MSG once again.

22:33.018 --> 22:34.978
- Yo,
this dude scored 38 points!

22:35.062 --> 22:36.271
- He made 38 points!

22:36.354 --> 22:37.689
[laughing]
How is he doing that?

22:37.773 --> 22:40.984
- 38 points
at Madison Square Garden.

22:41.068 --> 22:43.028
Are you fucking kidding me?

22:43.111 --> 22:45.530
- One of the more
incredible stories we've seen

22:45.614 --> 22:47.824
in the NBA in quite some time.

22:47.908 --> 22:49.576
- It just happened
against Kobe,

22:49.659 --> 22:52.079
like, against Kobe Bryant.

22:52.162 --> 22:55.248
And it was like this awe
and, like, magical moment

22:55.332 --> 22:57.959
of like, "Man, like,
you really did that

22:58.043 --> 22:59.461
"against, like,
one of the greatest

22:59.544 --> 23:00.962
to ever play the game."

23:01.046 --> 23:03.381
- For him to outscore Kobe--
rest in peace, Kobe--

23:03.465 --> 23:05.133
but for him to outscore Kobe,

23:05.217 --> 23:07.969
the leading scorer
in the league in the Garden,

23:08.053 --> 23:09.638
like, that was crazy.

23:09.721 --> 23:11.389
- I didn't believe it
till it was over

23:11.473 --> 23:15.310
because I'm supposed
to be an impartial journalist.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.938
But I get the box score,
and I say to myself,

23:18.021 --> 23:20.107
"I'm going to keep
this box score."

23:20.190 --> 23:22.275
Yeah, that's when I officially
was secure

23:22.359 --> 23:23.360
that this had happened.

23:23.443 --> 23:27.614
- And the fact that MSG,
but so much of this country,

23:27.697 --> 23:31.493
was having that moment
for an Asian American player,

23:31.576 --> 23:34.329
I just kept having to, like,
look away and look again.

23:34.413 --> 23:36.498
Like, is this really happening?

23:36.581 --> 23:39.292
And it wasn't just Asian people
who were talking about it.

23:39.376 --> 23:41.169
Everybody was talking about it!

23:41.253 --> 23:45.215
- There was a strain of weed
out in LA called "Linsanity OG"

23:45.298 --> 23:48.802
that Rick Ross Instagrammed
himself picking up.

23:48.885 --> 23:51.930
The Knicks did not have
the shirts to sell people.

23:52.013 --> 23:54.850
Barack Obama
was praising Jeremy Lin

23:54.933 --> 23:56.810
to his staff on Marine One.

23:56.893 --> 23:58.353
- I've been
on the Jeremy Lin bandwagon--

23:58.436 --> 23:59.646
- Are you taking credit
for Linsanity?

23:59.729 --> 24:00.981
It kind of feels like
you are a little bit.

24:01.064 --> 24:02.274
- I can't take credit for it.

24:02.357 --> 24:03.733
I'm just saying
I was there early.

24:03.817 --> 24:07.320
- When Jeremy's going through
this whole Linsanity moment,

24:07.404 --> 24:11.783
he never changed from that kid
who was sleeping on the couch.

24:11.867 --> 24:15.203
- He's like the calmest,
best energy to be around.

24:15.287 --> 24:17.372
He doesn't have a bad bone
in his body.

24:17.455 --> 24:19.332
He's gonna encourage us all
to pray

24:19.416 --> 24:20.667
and go to church with him.

24:20.750 --> 24:22.502
- The Lakers game,
that was wild.

24:22.586 --> 24:25.046
But I'm trying
to do everything I can

24:25.130 --> 24:26.464
to tune it out.

24:26.548 --> 24:28.842
But when we got to Toronto,

24:28.925 --> 24:30.218
that's when I knew.

24:30.302 --> 24:32.846
[cheers and applause]

24:32.929 --> 24:35.390
- What Jeremy Lin did at
the end of that Raptors game--

24:35.473 --> 24:39.477
he has the ball,
and he has the opportunity

24:39.561 --> 24:41.354
to pass the ball.

24:41.438 --> 24:45.025
- Jeremy waves them off.

24:45.108 --> 24:46.818
- And I remember I had to wave
'em off, like, multiple times

24:46.902 --> 24:47.819
because they were like, "What,

24:47.903 --> 24:48.945
you're not running
a pick and roll?"

24:49.029 --> 24:52.282
And I'm like,
"No, like, get out the way."

24:52.365 --> 24:54.242
- He takes the last shot.

24:54.326 --> 24:55.535
- This is mine.

24:55.619 --> 24:58.413
- This opportunity
might never come along again,

24:58.496 --> 25:01.583
and so I'm just gonna say,
"Fuck it" and go.

25:01.666 --> 25:04.044
- We could feel it.
He's not gonna miss this shot.

25:04.127 --> 25:06.463
- Five, four...

25:06.546 --> 25:08.048
- [inhales sharply]

25:08.131 --> 25:09.925
- Lin puts it up!

25:10.008 --> 25:12.427
[cheers and applause]

25:12.510 --> 25:16.348
- And the crowd went crazy
in Toronto, on the road!

25:16.431 --> 25:20.018
- He hit the game winner
in Toronto,

25:20.101 --> 25:22.938
and the Toronto fans erupted
for him.

25:23.021 --> 25:25.482
- We all know how rare it was,

25:25.565 --> 25:28.026
and we all know what it took
for him to get there,

25:28.109 --> 25:32.280
and that superseded the color
of your city's jersey.

25:32.364 --> 25:35.075
Like, who cares about the color
of your clothing at this point?

25:35.158 --> 25:37.744
Right? We're talking about
the color of his skin.

25:37.827 --> 25:40.330
- All my friends kept saying
is like...

25:44.501 --> 25:46.461
Do you know what that means?

25:46.544 --> 25:48.630
"Can you believe
we have dignity?"

25:48.713 --> 25:49.965
"Did you see
the way he did that?"

25:50.048 --> 25:51.132
No, no, no, it's my game too.

25:51.216 --> 25:53.134
I deserve to be here too.

25:53.218 --> 25:54.803
It's not a mean thing.

25:54.886 --> 25:58.473
It's not
a "I hate my teammates thing."

25:58.556 --> 26:01.017
It's "What if I had
the same audacity

26:01.101 --> 26:03.603
and confidence you had?"

26:03.687 --> 26:04.646
- This is who I am.

26:04.729 --> 26:05.939
This is what I prepared for.

26:06.022 --> 26:07.524
And this is what
I'm capable of.

26:07.607 --> 26:09.317
All you guys need
to do is watch and see.

26:09.401 --> 26:12.654
- I remember after he hit
that shot,

26:12.737 --> 26:14.114
I thought to myself,

26:14.197 --> 26:16.533
"How many moments
in my own life

26:16.616 --> 26:19.786
"did I pass up the ball
or hold myself small?

26:19.869 --> 26:22.497
"How many times
did I turn in that assignment

26:22.580 --> 26:25.333
"or not audition for that thing

26:25.417 --> 26:29.379
"or not put my name
as number one on the sheet?

26:29.462 --> 26:32.090
How many times
did I not wave someone off?"

26:32.173 --> 26:36.011
That's what that moment meant
to me.

26:36.094 --> 26:39.180
- That's not a thing
that Asian people get, man.

26:39.264 --> 26:41.016
That's not how we're cast.

26:41.099 --> 26:44.144
- Now, I think the spectrum
of masculinity is important.

26:44.227 --> 26:46.855
I think Asian men don't have
to prove themselves

26:46.938 --> 26:49.482
in that way,
but it's nice when you can see

26:49.566 --> 26:52.027
and point to a reference
like Jeremy Lin

26:52.110 --> 26:55.655
as, like, an example
of being able to be athletic,

26:55.739 --> 26:58.033
right, and dominating a sport
like the NBA.

26:58.116 --> 26:59.200
- Even when I'm on stage

26:59.284 --> 27:02.329
and I look into the eyes
of my audience,

27:02.412 --> 27:04.164
I see so many broken dreams.

27:04.247 --> 27:05.623
They're like, "Wait a second.

27:05.707 --> 27:07.167
"I don't have to work
at Deloitte?

27:07.250 --> 27:09.502
Like,
I can be a stand-up comedian?"

27:09.586 --> 27:11.671
It's just--it's this moment.

27:11.755 --> 27:13.882
It broke the Matrix for us.

27:13.965 --> 27:15.884
- I knew a little bit back then

27:15.967 --> 27:19.596
why that shot was just bigger
than that shot in that game,

27:19.679 --> 27:23.641
but now I understand it
even more so.

27:23.725 --> 27:25.935
It was a heroic moment.

27:26.019 --> 27:28.730
Like, it was a moment
that so many people

27:28.813 --> 27:31.858
had not experienced,
but wanted to experience.

27:31.941 --> 27:33.193
Hollywood, the world, like,

27:33.276 --> 27:38.239
we didn't have
these heroic moments,

27:38.323 --> 27:43.578
and it was always boxed
into the Asian stereotype.

27:43.661 --> 27:47.874
But for it to happen that way,
on that platform, in that game,

27:47.957 --> 27:51.461
against people
who didn't look like me,

27:51.544 --> 27:55.548
in a game where people like me
don't really exist--

27:55.632 --> 27:59.803
that's why, to this day,
this moment lives in the minds

27:59.886 --> 28:01.930
and the hearts
of so many people,

28:02.013 --> 28:05.100
because it was so much bigger
than basketball.

28:05.183 --> 28:08.103
- If you had described
Linsanity before it happened

28:08.186 --> 28:09.938
to someone,
I think everyone would be like,

28:10.021 --> 28:11.689
"That's--that's not possible."

28:11.773 --> 28:13.733
- It's the most impossible
thing

28:13.817 --> 28:16.069
I think I have ever witnessed
in my life.

28:16.152 --> 28:19.239
- It's so weird to revisit
this moment ten years later

28:19.322 --> 28:21.825
because...

28:21.908 --> 28:24.411
it's like the worst time
to be an Asian American.

28:24.494 --> 28:27.914
And so it's really hard...

28:27.997 --> 28:30.959
to only appreciate
what happened ten years ago

28:31.042 --> 28:33.503
when you're reminded
of where we're at right now.

28:33.586 --> 28:35.839
That's what's really hard.

28:35.922 --> 28:37.674
[somber musical sting]

28:40.385 --> 28:42.804
- The weekend of March 15th,

28:42.887 --> 28:47.267
the first weekend of everyone
locking things down in 2020,

28:47.350 --> 28:49.185
when the pandemic just started,

28:49.269 --> 28:50.770
a white guy in a pickup truck
slowed down

28:50.854 --> 28:52.272
when it was a green light
for him

28:52.355 --> 28:54.941
and stopped right in front
of me just to flip me off.

28:55.024 --> 28:57.193
And then I felt my face get hot

28:57.277 --> 28:59.612
and my stomach getting queasy
because--

28:59.696 --> 29:01.948
that was when I realized, like,
"Oh, shit.

29:02.031 --> 29:03.950
Yeah, I've felt this before."

29:04.033 --> 29:08.621
The feeling like
I'm about to get the hate

29:08.705 --> 29:10.206
and the anger directed at me

29:10.290 --> 29:13.334
for no reason other than just
walking around being Asian.

29:13.418 --> 29:15.503
It gave me a sense
of what was to come.

29:15.587 --> 29:19.174
- Hate crimes targeting Asian
Americans has skyrocketed.

29:19.257 --> 29:21.843
- Suni Lee said she was
recently pepper sprayed.

29:21.926 --> 29:24.846
- The suspect
lit a 79-year-old man on fire

29:24.929 --> 29:26.973
at the Chinatown
Cultural Plaza.

29:27.056 --> 29:28.558
- Police say
that Christina Yuna Lee

29:28.641 --> 29:31.978
was stabbed more than 40 times
in the neck and torso.

29:32.061 --> 29:33.897
- An Asian man who was
the victim of a hate crime

29:33.980 --> 29:35.231
just died of his injuries.

29:39.903 --> 29:41.946
- Asian man viciously kicked
to the ground.

29:43.448 --> 29:45.950
- Communities on edge.

29:46.034 --> 29:50.538
- Anybody see my--my--my skin.

29:50.622 --> 29:54.375
- She said she doesn't want
people to see her skin color.

29:54.459 --> 29:55.710
- For every Asian American
person

29:55.793 --> 29:58.546
or anybody who comes
from any minority group,

29:58.630 --> 30:01.049
you're immediately told

30:01.132 --> 30:03.551
even though
your citizenship status

30:03.635 --> 30:05.887
makes you a home jersey,

30:05.970 --> 30:09.390
the moment you start putting
yourself out in society,

30:09.474 --> 30:11.392
they tell you,
"No, no, no, no, no.

30:11.476 --> 30:13.394
"You're an away jersey.

30:13.478 --> 30:15.897
Where are you from?"

30:15.980 --> 30:17.148
"Oh, I'm from Sacramento."

30:17.232 --> 30:19.108
"No, no, no, no,
where are you from from?"

30:19.192 --> 30:23.696
- This face is always read
as being alien,

30:23.780 --> 30:27.700
a betrayer, a spy, weird.

30:27.784 --> 30:32.664
- In times
of global catastrophe,

30:32.747 --> 30:36.209
a scapegoat
can be pretty helpful.

30:36.292 --> 30:39.587
- Sometimes I'll be walking
my daughter to school,

30:39.671 --> 30:41.798
and I'll see different kids.

30:41.881 --> 30:44.759
Young white kids,
white parents,

30:44.842 --> 30:46.803
they'll walk
into school without a mask.

30:46.886 --> 30:51.140
Every single Asian kid
is double masked

30:51.224 --> 30:53.685
like they're in a goddamn
hazmat suit

30:53.768 --> 30:58.064
because the room for error--
it's this thin.

30:58.147 --> 30:59.107
God forbid...
- [sneezes]

30:59.190 --> 31:02.402
- Your Asian son or daughter
coughs or sneezes,

31:02.485 --> 31:03.987
and then all the kids
are like,

31:04.070 --> 31:05.572
"Yo, you got that Wuhan?

31:05.655 --> 31:07.532
You got that "Kung flu?"

31:07.615 --> 31:11.411
- And so anti-Asian violence
coalesced

31:11.494 --> 31:12.787
around all of those things

31:12.870 --> 31:15.623
and, I think,
around a fundamental

31:15.707 --> 31:18.960
underlying issue
with how people see Asians,

31:19.043 --> 31:21.129
which is that...

31:21.212 --> 31:22.672
you could take 'em.

31:22.755 --> 31:25.049
They're not to be feared.

31:25.133 --> 31:27.135
You wanna pick on somebody
that you could

31:27.218 --> 31:28.845
probably go stuff
into a locker?

31:28.928 --> 31:30.221
Pick on the Asian kid.
- [laughs]

31:30.305 --> 31:31.514
- If all we see are stories

31:31.598 --> 31:34.809
of Asian people
being submissive

31:34.892 --> 31:39.606
and weak and being dominated
on TV and movies and in sports,

31:39.689 --> 31:43.776
then of course that translates
into real world behavior.

31:43.860 --> 31:45.945
- Six of the eight people
he's now accused of killing

31:46.029 --> 31:47.071
are Asian women.

31:47.155 --> 31:49.198
- There are a lot
of intense discussions here

31:49.282 --> 31:50.908
about potential hate crimes.

31:50.992 --> 31:53.828
- The shooting
in Atlanta, Georgia,

31:53.911 --> 31:58.166
because Asian women
have been stereotyped

31:58.249 --> 32:01.461
as being, you know,
these dragon ladies

32:01.544 --> 32:05.840
or overly sexualized
and exoticized,

32:05.923 --> 32:09.677
that incident
was just so horrifying,

32:09.761 --> 32:12.013
but also galvanizing.

32:12.096 --> 32:14.390
And the last few years,

32:14.474 --> 32:17.018
I think,
have been a wake-up call

32:17.101 --> 32:19.354
to so many of us
in the Asian community

32:19.437 --> 32:20.396
that we have to speak up.

32:20.480 --> 32:21.939
- Ten years later,

32:22.023 --> 32:24.275
I'm excited to talk
about Jeremy Lin right now

32:24.359 --> 32:27.654
because, I think,
beyond basketball,

32:27.737 --> 32:31.199
it's important for us
to understand

32:31.282 --> 32:34.494
that to be outstanding
as an Asian American,

32:34.577 --> 32:35.828
to represent
who were are

32:35.912 --> 32:38.873
beyond just stereotypes,
is that much more important.

32:38.956 --> 32:42.418
Because it's that kind
of lack of familiarity

32:42.502 --> 32:46.130
with us as humans
that causes people

32:46.214 --> 32:50.093
to be willing
to fucking attack us.

32:50.176 --> 32:54.472
- When I think back
on those moments of Linsanity,

32:54.555 --> 32:56.724
everyone was talking about

32:56.808 --> 32:59.894
this unknown
Asian American player.

32:59.977 --> 33:03.523
I long to feel those moments

33:03.606 --> 33:06.317
of just, like, pure joy
and unity.

33:06.401 --> 33:07.902
It was really validating.

33:07.985 --> 33:09.696
It was too short-lived,

33:09.779 --> 33:13.741
but it did really open a door.

33:13.825 --> 33:15.868
- The reason
why Jeremy matters

33:15.952 --> 33:18.037
and why
we're talking about it is,

33:18.121 --> 33:22.041
it represents possibility

33:22.125 --> 33:26.254
and an expansive worldview
at the highest possible level.

33:26.337 --> 33:29.215
If this is possible,
what else is possible?

33:29.298 --> 33:31.467
[cheers and applause]

33:31.551 --> 33:33.761
- The biggest thing
Linsanity brought was hope.

33:33.845 --> 33:35.763
It inspired people,

33:35.847 --> 33:37.807
and it showed that when
you chase your dreams,

33:37.890 --> 33:40.393
good things can happen.

33:40.476 --> 33:43.271
And I think
as we go into the reality

33:43.354 --> 33:46.315
of where we are today
as a society,

33:46.399 --> 33:47.734
we need to hold on to hope.

33:47.817 --> 33:49.569
We need to believe
that things can be better

33:49.652 --> 33:51.738
and we need to fight
for those things.

33:51.821 --> 33:53.239
- Maybe
the most unifying aspect

33:53.322 --> 33:54.741
of the Asian American
experience

33:54.824 --> 33:59.203
is this desire to be included.

33:59.287 --> 34:01.581
It's to be seen as American,

34:01.664 --> 34:04.584
to be counted as one...

34:04.667 --> 34:06.461
of you.

34:06.544 --> 34:11.174
And what Jeremy Lin's story is

34:11.257 --> 34:16.679
is the most visceral example
of...

34:16.763 --> 34:20.850
getting to be a part of a world

34:20.933 --> 34:25.646
that had never really had space
for you before.

34:25.730 --> 34:29.067
- Out of that crisis,
or I should say this crisis,

34:29.150 --> 34:31.861
because we're still in it,

34:31.944 --> 34:34.238
something really extraordinary
happened,

34:34.322 --> 34:36.908
which is that the Asian
American community

34:36.991 --> 34:41.871
is unwilling to stand
on the sidelines anymore.

34:41.954 --> 34:45.458
Like, we're all a bunch
of Jeremy Lins out there,

34:45.541 --> 34:49.462
just going for it
and exercising our voices

34:49.545 --> 34:56.177
and being unwilling
to just remain on the bench.

34:57.386 --> 35:01.307
- Jeremy Lin showed
that he belonged,

35:01.390 --> 35:04.977
and he gave
an entire generation the hope

35:05.061 --> 35:07.188
that they can belong.

35:07.271 --> 35:10.149
- I really want
the next generation to grow up

35:10.233 --> 35:11.984
to not be ashamed
of being Asian,

35:12.068 --> 35:14.862
to be proud of your culture,
your upbringing,

35:14.946 --> 35:18.658
your parents, your appearance,
your talents, your personality.

35:18.741 --> 35:20.743
I want them to be proud
to be themselves

35:20.827 --> 35:22.829
and to have a equal
and an fair chance

35:22.912 --> 35:24.497
to be their fullest self,

35:24.580 --> 35:26.207
to not have to deal
with everything

35:26.290 --> 35:30.002
that the previous generations
had to deal with.

35:30.086 --> 35:31.045
- I love the fact

35:31.128 --> 35:33.923
that we get an Asian American
Marvel hero now.

35:34.006 --> 35:37.593
That's awesome. I love that.

35:37.677 --> 35:40.096
You could also just
