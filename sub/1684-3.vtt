00:01.002 --> 00:02.504
<i>Previously on</i>
Sleepy Hollow...

00:02.587 --> 00:05.423
<i>My wife is now a captive</i>
<i>of the Horseman of Death.</i>

00:05.507 --> 00:08.301
<i>And the Horseman of War</i>
<i>is my son.</i>

00:08.551 --> 00:12.305
I will not rest until
I find a way for you
to rise on earth.

00:12.430 --> 00:14.683
<i>If the point of this illusion</i>
<i>is to convince me that</i>

00:14.766 --> 00:17.852
part of you still
remains human, I assure you,
it will not work.

00:17.936 --> 00:20.480
<i>I have heard talk between</i>
<i>Abraham and Henry.</i>

00:20.563 --> 00:23.274
There's a greater plan.
And if I stay,
I will learn it.

00:23.358 --> 00:24.859
<i>This new sheriff</i>
<i>means business.</i>

00:24.943 --> 00:26.820
Jennifer Mills,
you are under arrest.

00:26.903 --> 00:27.904
"Good people, bad luck"?

00:27.987 --> 00:29.197
I heard your mother
say that once.

00:29.280 --> 00:30.323
You knew my mother?

00:30.407 --> 00:32.325
I'm sure you're aware
that your responses

00:32.409 --> 00:34.828
obligate me to have you
transferred to a psych ward.

00:34.911 --> 00:36.204
<i>Excuse me.</i>
<i>I'm Henry Parish.</i>

00:36.287 --> 00:37.372
Can I help you?

00:37.455 --> 00:38.623
I'm Captain Irving's attorney.

00:38.707 --> 00:39.749
My wife
thinks you can help.

00:39.874 --> 00:41.042
And I will.

00:59.936 --> 01:01.229
<i>What does</i>
<i>it say about my life,</i>

01:01.312 --> 01:04.524
<i>that I know</i>
<i>Tarrytown Psychiatric's</i>
<i>visiting hours by heart?</i>

01:06.860 --> 01:07.902
Hi.

01:10.071 --> 01:11.114
Hi.

01:11.197 --> 01:13.116
Good morrow, sir.
Hi.

01:14.284 --> 01:15.285
Hello.

01:16.161 --> 01:17.579
Abbie Mills.

01:17.662 --> 01:18.955
Admitting a new patient?

01:22.167 --> 01:23.251
Oh, no.

01:23.668 --> 01:26.880
Abbie Mills, Ichabod Crane,
to see Frank Irving.

01:27.088 --> 01:28.089
Okay.

01:28.173 --> 01:29.174
Bye.

01:30.091 --> 01:31.926
I'm sorry,
but you can't see him.

01:32.010 --> 01:33.428
Frank Irving
can't have visitors?

01:33.511 --> 01:36.264
He can, but you and you
are barred from visitation.

01:36.347 --> 01:39.434
On whose authority,
may I ask?

01:39.517 --> 01:41.478
It says here,
his lawyer,

01:41.561 --> 01:42.687
Henry Parish?

01:44.022 --> 01:46.608
Henry Parish was here?

01:46.691 --> 01:47.734
Mmm-hmm.

01:47.817 --> 01:48.818
Is he here now?

01:48.902 --> 01:50.612
He was.
You just missed him.

01:50.737 --> 01:51.946
It's important that
you try to remember

01:52.030 --> 01:53.531
anything that could
help us find him.

01:56.326 --> 01:58.119
He asked for
the number of a taxi.

02:00.997 --> 02:02.373
Confounding.

02:02.665 --> 02:04.459
Henry Parish assumes
the mantel of War,

02:04.542 --> 02:07.253
and when he emerges,
it is not as
a raging colossus,

02:07.337 --> 02:09.297
but as an attorney.

02:09.380 --> 02:12.300
Perhaps when we
hear from Katrina,

02:12.383 --> 02:14.052
she can reveal
Henry's plans.

02:14.636 --> 02:17.013
Yeah. I'm sure we'll
hear from her soon.

02:27.232 --> 02:29.108
Fill out the top part.

02:29.692 --> 02:30.860
I had a dog once.

02:31.736 --> 02:35.156
Every time I opened the door,
even just a crack,

02:35.240 --> 02:39.035
he'd shoot out,
cross the street,
chase cars,

02:39.118 --> 02:42.455
I'd bring him back,
but then out he'd go again.

02:42.539 --> 02:45.542
And one day,
he just...

02:45.625 --> 02:47.043
He didn't make it home.

02:49.587 --> 02:52.173
Sorry about your dog,
Sheriff Reyes.

02:52.257 --> 02:54.592
You've been on a long leash
here, yourself.

02:55.051 --> 02:57.929
Your sister found
a judge to give you
community service this time,

02:58.012 --> 03:00.390
but next time...

03:01.766 --> 03:03.601
I just don't want to see you
end up like your mother.

03:06.980 --> 03:08.523
What do you
know about her?

03:08.606 --> 03:10.859
I know she was in
Tarrytown Psych,
same as you.

03:10.942 --> 03:12.819
Well, I'm all past that now.

03:12.902 --> 03:13.903
Good.

03:14.487 --> 03:15.947
Prove it to me.

03:22.036 --> 03:24.414
This is where
the cab driver
said he took Henry.

03:24.497 --> 03:25.665
A bank.

03:25.790 --> 03:28.626
Perhaps War's first act
is to strike our
financial system.

03:28.710 --> 03:30.587
He wouldn't be
the first to try it.

03:34.340 --> 03:36.426
Is that considered
acceptable now?

03:40.263 --> 03:41.264
Oh...

03:41.347 --> 03:43.308
Lots of attitudes have
changed since your days.

03:43.766 --> 03:45.935
Not everyone's,
but the Supreme Court
has upheld

03:46.019 --> 03:47.645
the Constitutional right
of same-sex couples.

03:48.146 --> 03:50.690
And more and more states are
even legalizing gay marriage.

03:50.773 --> 03:53.151
I meant gentlemen
wearing hats indoors.

03:53.610 --> 03:55.862
I know about homosexuals,
thank you.

03:55.945 --> 03:57.155
I trained under
Baron von Steuben.

03:59.324 --> 04:03.077
His affections
for his own sex
were well known.

04:03.661 --> 04:06.080
Also, I watched
the finale of <i>Glee.</i>

04:11.669 --> 04:12.670
There he is.

04:12.879 --> 04:15.465
I cannot allow this
deception any longer.

04:15.548 --> 04:16.549
Wait.

04:16.633 --> 04:18.635
You think he's gonna tell us
what he wants with Irving?

04:18.718 --> 04:20.845
Or Moloch's plan
for Armageddon?

04:21.512 --> 04:23.431
We need to be
smart about this.

04:24.849 --> 04:26.851
Cooler heads
and caution, then.

04:28.102 --> 04:30.271
But I will not allow him
out of my sight.

04:31.189 --> 04:33.274
And I'm certain
the Horseman of War

04:33.399 --> 04:35.443
is not simply whiling
away a lazy Saturday.

04:36.694 --> 04:37.779
That was in the bank.

04:37.904 --> 04:38.988
Someone call the police!

04:39.197 --> 04:42.492
Charlie 62, one shot fired
at Sleepy Hollow Savings.

04:42.575 --> 04:43.952
Requesting backup. Over.

04:44.035 --> 04:46.037
<i>- Copy, Charlie 62.</i>
<i>- Backup is on the way.</i>

04:47.288 --> 04:49.874
No police work, Crane.
Sheriff's orders, remember?

04:55.463 --> 04:56.714
Get back, all of you!

04:58.716 --> 05:00.885
It's mine.
I've got it coming.

05:00.969 --> 05:02.845
Miss Galway?
Stay there!

05:03.304 --> 05:04.639
It's Abbie Mills.

05:05.556 --> 05:07.976
You helped me set up
my first savings account,
remember?

05:09.435 --> 05:11.062
Whatever happened here...

05:11.145 --> 05:12.438
15 years.

05:12.647 --> 05:15.191
15 years of my life
to this place.

05:15.274 --> 05:16.317
And nothing!

05:17.318 --> 05:20.071
I will take what I deserve.

05:23.241 --> 05:24.242
Okay.

05:25.076 --> 05:26.077
I get that.

05:27.912 --> 05:29.122
Let's talk about it.

05:31.791 --> 05:33.209
Let's let these people go.

05:34.460 --> 05:36.295
And we'll just talk,
all right?

05:39.882 --> 05:42.093
I'm gonna come over there,
and take the gun.

05:42.176 --> 05:43.177
No.

05:43.678 --> 05:44.887
Stay back.

05:45.346 --> 05:46.347
They owe me.

06:08.453 --> 06:10.496
Lieutenant?
Lydia Galway's dead.

06:11.622 --> 06:13.207
She loved this place.
She was the most considerate,

06:13.291 --> 06:14.584
gentle...

06:15.543 --> 06:16.794
She would never do this.

06:17.545 --> 06:18.713
Do you suppose Henry...

06:18.796 --> 06:21.132
Damn right.
He was just here, now this?

06:21.299 --> 06:22.300
I want to know why,

06:22.383 --> 06:24.135
I want to know how
before it happens again.

06:47.992 --> 06:50.703
Is the proverbial
coast clear?

06:50.787 --> 06:52.330
Enter at your own risk.

06:53.498 --> 06:56.918
Slinking through the tunnels
like a guttersnipe,
day in and day out,

06:57.001 --> 07:00.713
to avoid Madame Sheriff
is an absolute waste
of our valuable time.

07:00.797 --> 07:02.423
Nevertheless,

07:02.507 --> 07:05.259
have you made any progress
in aligning this
mayhem with Henry?

07:08.930 --> 07:12.183
Security footage
shows him at the bank,
but...

07:14.727 --> 07:15.728
That's all he did.

07:16.312 --> 07:17.396
Coins for cash.

07:22.693 --> 07:24.320
Wait, wait. Did you see that?

07:24.570 --> 07:26.864
Uh, unspool it.

07:38.793 --> 07:39.794
There...

07:39.877 --> 07:41.295
You see what she did?

07:41.379 --> 07:42.672
She took one
of the coins.

07:43.381 --> 07:46.467
Coin's placed
into circulation,

07:46.551 --> 07:48.719
a sudden turn to darkness...

07:51.556 --> 07:54.725
I was once on a secret mission
for General Washington,

07:54.809 --> 07:57.353
which I thought was
to stop a British plot.

08:01.941 --> 08:04.110
<i>Counterfeiters</i>
<i>called "shovers"</i>

08:04.193 --> 08:07.572
<i>were attempting to</i>
<i>flood our markets</i>
<i>with fake currency</i>

08:07.655 --> 08:09.866
<i>to render it worthless.</i>

08:21.919 --> 08:23.421
All secure, General!

08:25.923 --> 08:30.219
We had come for
a specific batch of coins

08:31.637 --> 08:33.014
<i>destined to be melted down</i>

08:33.097 --> 08:36.267
<i>and then re-stamped</i>
<i>for circulation</i>
<i>among the populace.</i>

08:36.350 --> 08:39.437
<i>What if these coins were</i>
<i>not meant to bankrupt us,</i>

08:39.937 --> 08:41.272
but to turn us?

08:42.523 --> 08:45.151
You said Ms. Galway
loved the bank,
loved her job.

08:45.234 --> 08:47.486
Unhaltingly loyal
to her employers for so long,

08:47.570 --> 08:49.739
and then turned
against them so swiftly.

08:50.281 --> 08:53.409
<i>Much like the turn</i>
<i>of our General Arnold.</i>

08:53.492 --> 08:55.536
Wait. Benedict Arnold?

08:55.620 --> 08:57.538
You've heard of him?

08:57.622 --> 09:00.416
Little bit, yeah.
Most notorious traitor
in American history.

09:00.541 --> 09:01.626
Uh...

09:01.709 --> 09:03.294
That's... That's a bit harsh.

09:04.212 --> 09:05.671
And unfortunate.

09:06.088 --> 09:08.090
Benedict was
a brave soldier,

09:08.174 --> 09:10.635
and loved this country
very deeply.

09:11.427 --> 09:15.431
I never understood
why he turned so suddenly,

09:15.514 --> 09:17.850
so ruthlessly,

09:18.684 --> 09:19.894
until now.

09:20.353 --> 09:23.439
<i>It was shortly after</i>
<i>his exposure to those coins</i>

09:23.522 --> 09:26.025
<i>that Arnold began</i>
<i>conspiring with the enemy.</i>

09:27.026 --> 09:28.903
<i>It was as if</i>
<i>he'd been fighting</i>

09:28.986 --> 09:31.656
<i>a great evil in his heart</i>
<i>the whole time,</i>

09:31.822 --> 09:35.243
<i>and suddenly,</i>
<i>it overwhelmed him.</i>

09:36.494 --> 09:38.246
Were he not thwarted,

09:38.329 --> 09:41.916
these coins would have
turned the tide of
the war against America.

09:41.999 --> 09:46.545
And now Henry has brought
one of those same coins
to Sleepy Hollow.

09:46.629 --> 09:49.507
Perhaps to turn the tide
of this war in his favor.

09:49.590 --> 09:52.343
Crane, that coin,

09:52.426 --> 09:53.844
anyone could have it by now.

10:48.065 --> 10:50.943
<i>"If money go before,</i>
<i>all ways do lie open."</i>

10:51.902 --> 10:53.654
Opening now, in our favor.

10:53.738 --> 10:55.948
Opening far too slowly.

10:56.032 --> 10:57.992
Why are you
only telling me now
of this current plan?

10:58.075 --> 11:01.245
It's not my job to
indulge your needs.

11:01.329 --> 11:04.874
Katrina was correct to ask
why I am confined here.

11:04.957 --> 11:06.459
Yet you come and go freely,

11:06.542 --> 11:08.919
plotting our future
from the comfort
of your family home.

11:10.087 --> 11:12.465
If you have grievances
with our leader's strategy,

11:12.548 --> 11:14.175
by all means,
raise them

11:15.009 --> 11:16.177
with Moloch.

11:23.351 --> 11:26.687
Abraham is a simple man
with simple ambitions.

11:27.313 --> 11:30.274
Do not attempt to complicate
his motivations.

11:30.358 --> 11:32.026
Jeremy, my son...

11:32.109 --> 11:33.652
It will kill you.

11:35.613 --> 11:37.782
And how are you settling
into Fredericks Manor?

11:49.168 --> 11:51.212
Miss Jenny, good day.

11:51.295 --> 11:53.172
How nice to see you once again

11:53.255 --> 11:55.633
breathe the sweet air
of freedom.

11:55.716 --> 11:59.345
Along with a slightly stale
whiff of community service.

11:59.428 --> 12:00.554
You're welcome, by the way.

12:00.638 --> 12:01.639
Thank you.

12:01.722 --> 12:02.848
I was just about to say that.

12:02.932 --> 12:05.226
Anyway, you two go ahead
and stop the Apocalypse.

12:05.309 --> 12:07.228
I'll be hosing
graffiti off a wall.

12:08.354 --> 12:09.897
Hey, what was
the fallout at the bank?

12:09.980 --> 12:11.023
Henry behind it?

12:11.107 --> 12:12.233
Yes, we suspect so.

12:12.316 --> 12:14.735
We haven't got any leads
from Corbin's files
or anywhere, yet.

12:14.819 --> 12:17.113
It is beyond frustrating.

12:17.822 --> 12:20.991
He has a larger design,
one we don't yet see.

12:21.492 --> 12:25.496
A battle for our souls
that begins with this coin.

12:25.955 --> 12:27.665
You should talk to
this guy I know, Hawley.

12:28.165 --> 12:29.166
Hawley?

12:29.834 --> 12:31.252
You never mentioned
him before.

12:31.335 --> 12:32.878
Never mentioned
a lot of names before.

12:32.962 --> 12:34.463
Remember, we didn't talk
for 13 years.

12:34.547 --> 12:36.132
Who is Mr. Hawley?

12:36.215 --> 12:38.801
He's kind of a go-to guy
for rare artifacts,

12:38.884 --> 12:40.928
stuff of
a supernatural nature.

12:41.011 --> 12:42.555
When he's in town,
he does a lot of business

12:42.638 --> 12:43.764
down by the river.

12:43.848 --> 12:45.850
I'll send you his picture.

12:46.725 --> 12:47.977
Excellent.

12:48.060 --> 12:49.520
We shall make contact.

12:49.603 --> 12:51.105
Oh, my God.

12:51.188 --> 12:52.648
That bitch.

12:53.566 --> 12:54.733
Pardon?

12:54.817 --> 12:55.818
Who?

12:56.110 --> 12:58.028
Sheriff Reyes.
Abbie, look at this.

12:58.154 --> 13:00.614
She was here in Sleepy Hollow
when Mom got put away.

13:00.698 --> 13:01.866
Yeah, I know.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.201
What are you doing?

13:04.285 --> 13:05.578
What do you mean,
you know?

13:05.661 --> 13:08.289
Jenny, you used my log-in
to break into her file.

13:08.372 --> 13:09.707
You knew she was
here back then,

13:09.874 --> 13:11.167
and you didn't
tell me, why not?

13:11.250 --> 13:13.335
Because of this,
the reaction that
I knew you would have.

13:13.627 --> 13:15.629
And here I am,
thinking I could
trust you again?

13:15.713 --> 13:17.089
Of course, you can...
Jenny...

13:17.173 --> 13:18.799
Long time ago.

13:18.883 --> 13:20.468
It doesn't matter.

13:20.551 --> 13:21.552
It doesn't matter?

13:21.635 --> 13:24.722
That she was the one
that put our mother
in the psych ward.

13:25.222 --> 13:26.640
What?
Yeah.

13:26.724 --> 13:27.850
Now, it matters.

13:29.685 --> 13:32.521
It was Reyes' testimony
that landed our mother

13:32.605 --> 13:34.648
in the same hellhole
that I wound up in.

13:34.732 --> 13:36.734
Where she took
her own life.

13:36.817 --> 13:38.986
That's why we were
in foster care
and not with her...

13:39.069 --> 13:40.321
Jenny, Reyes...
...when Moloch found us...

13:40.404 --> 13:41.947
...didn't put her there...
When Moloch found us...

13:42.031 --> 13:43.616
...Mom was unstable.
...and ruined our lives...

13:43.699 --> 13:44.950
Remember,
she tried to kidnap us.

13:45.034 --> 13:46.076
It wasn't kidnapping!

13:46.160 --> 13:49.079
She wanted us.
She loved us.

13:49.163 --> 13:51.707
And it drove her crazy
that we ended up
in a foster home,

13:51.790 --> 13:53.000
because Reyes...

13:53.083 --> 13:54.418
Reyes was doing her job.

13:56.420 --> 13:57.588
"Her job"?

13:59.673 --> 14:01.717
I got to get going.

14:01.926 --> 14:02.885
Jenny...

14:02.968 --> 14:04.053
See you, Crane.

14:06.096 --> 14:08.057
Lieutenant, are you...

14:08.140 --> 14:09.350
I'm good.

14:10.142 --> 14:11.977
Let's go find this Hawley.

14:20.486 --> 14:22.112
<i>He's holding me back.</i>

14:22.196 --> 14:24.198
<i>He doesn't care about me.</i>

14:24.281 --> 14:26.450
<i>He has it coming.</i>

14:33.624 --> 14:34.792
Nick.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.001
Officers.

14:36.085 --> 14:37.461
Not I.

14:37.545 --> 14:39.964
Miss Jennifer Mills
sent us.

14:41.382 --> 14:43.634
I daresay she will
vouchsafe our intentions.

14:43.717 --> 14:47.304
We endeavor to learn
what you know
of a rare coin.

14:48.472 --> 14:49.848
Why is he
talking like that?

14:49.932 --> 14:51.225
You get used to it.

14:52.142 --> 14:53.143
This coin is special.

14:53.227 --> 14:54.979
Some say it even has powers.

14:55.062 --> 14:57.856
Maybe to cause its holder
to betray his
deepest loyalties.

14:58.691 --> 14:59.733
Yeah.

14:59.817 --> 15:01.151
I may have heard
of a coin like that.

15:01.235 --> 15:02.695
Then elaborate, please.

15:02.778 --> 15:04.238
Slow down, Shakespeare.

15:04.321 --> 15:05.823
My information's
not for free.

15:05.906 --> 15:07.324
We're not paying for it.

15:07.533 --> 15:08.701
Okay.

15:09.368 --> 15:11.745
Well, how about you guys
take me along, then?

15:12.371 --> 15:16.083
I help you find this coin,
keep it for my troubles,

15:16.166 --> 15:17.209
everybody wins.

15:19.169 --> 15:21.046
I know his type,
Lieutenant.

15:21.130 --> 15:22.548
He's a privateer.

15:22.673 --> 15:24.967
I saw many smugglers
like him during the war.

15:25.843 --> 15:27.720
The only allegiances
men like him keep

15:27.803 --> 15:29.680
are with the faces
on his money.

15:33.183 --> 15:35.019
I'll tell Jenny
you said hello.

15:37.146 --> 15:38.480
It's probably a shekel.

15:40.232 --> 15:41.358
From Rome.

15:41.442 --> 15:43.944
Well, Tyre,
to be accurate, but...

15:44.653 --> 15:45.821
Wait...

15:45.904 --> 15:47.031
A Tyrian shekel?

15:47.698 --> 15:48.907
You know what that is?

15:48.991 --> 15:50.576
I'm afraid I do.

15:50.659 --> 15:52.953
The chest of coins
Benedict Arnold opened...

15:53.037 --> 15:54.455
Wait, wait...

15:54.538 --> 15:55.581
Benedict Arnold?

15:55.664 --> 15:57.666
There were 30 coins inside.

15:58.208 --> 15:59.877
30 pieces of silver.

16:02.171 --> 16:03.172
30 pieces of silver.

16:03.255 --> 16:06.759
That's what the Bible
said Judas was paid
to betray Jesus.

16:06.842 --> 16:09.595
Benjamin Franklin said
of Benedict Arnold's turn...

16:09.678 --> 16:14.016
"Judas sold only one man,
Arnold sold three million."

16:14.975 --> 16:18.354
Perhaps Franklin knew
these two traitorous
figures were linked

16:18.437 --> 16:20.981
by a cursed coin
of the Roman Empire.

16:21.231 --> 16:22.483
So, maybe
by tarnishing souls,

16:22.566 --> 16:24.485
Henry's trying to build
his own empire here.

16:24.568 --> 16:26.278
One soldier at a time.

16:26.403 --> 16:29.323
David! Did you get
the McNeal order filled?

16:53.055 --> 16:55.391
Hello, Sleepy Hollow.

16:55.474 --> 16:57.101
Time to wake up.

17:16.161 --> 17:20.165
I fear the flower shop bombing
was also the work
of the Tyrian shekel.

17:21.333 --> 17:23.877
The gentleman
who carried it out,
is he in custody?

17:23.961 --> 17:26.046
Yeah. Dave Webster.

17:26.130 --> 17:27.381
Victim was his father.

17:27.464 --> 17:29.133
Dave's brother went
off to law school,

17:29.216 --> 17:31.719
Dave stayed behind
to help his dad
run the store.

17:31.802 --> 17:33.887
Friend said he was
the easiest-going
guy in the world,

17:33.971 --> 17:35.889
and seemed fine
with the situation.

17:35.973 --> 17:37.141
He wasn't.

17:37.975 --> 17:39.059
And there he is.

17:39.143 --> 17:40.769
At the bank.

17:43.856 --> 17:45.232
Those shadows.

17:46.316 --> 17:49.069
The same as the ones
I saw on Ms. Galway.

17:49.153 --> 17:51.071
It's like their dark sides
trying to get out.

17:51.488 --> 17:55.075
If the coin did lead
Mr. Webster's "dark side"

17:55.159 --> 17:57.035
to this latest betrayal,

17:57.494 --> 17:58.579
it would have been
on his person

17:58.662 --> 17:59.830
when he was apprehended.

18:02.332 --> 18:05.169
The log shows he had
one quarter in his pocket
when he was booked.

18:07.588 --> 18:08.589
Lieutenant,

18:08.672 --> 18:12.259
the Tyrian shekel is almost
exactly an inch in diameter.

18:12.342 --> 18:14.219
Same as a quarter.

18:14.303 --> 18:16.472
The head, the eagle.

18:18.140 --> 18:19.600
They look enough alike.

18:19.683 --> 18:24.188
Which means the coin of Judas
may be in the evidence room
as we speak.

18:27.274 --> 18:28.984
Mills, my office.

18:35.073 --> 18:37.534
You want to tell me
why you accessed
my personnel files?

18:39.244 --> 18:40.454
Yes.

18:42.539 --> 18:43.957
You said you knew my mom.

18:45.209 --> 18:47.503
What you didn't say
is that you were the one
who put her away.

18:49.213 --> 18:50.547
Must have been
hard speaking up,

18:50.672 --> 18:51.924
knowing that they'd
put her in Psych.

18:53.008 --> 18:54.718
Just doing my job.

18:54.802 --> 18:59.139
That's what I thought, too,
but if you were
doing your job,

18:59.223 --> 19:01.433
she would have gone
to prison for kidnapping.

19:02.851 --> 19:04.770
I thought, in Psych,

19:04.853 --> 19:06.647
maybe she could get help.

19:06.730 --> 19:09.817
What happened after that was

19:09.900 --> 19:10.984
unfortunate.

19:11.652 --> 19:13.111
Yes, it was.

19:15.239 --> 19:16.740
I got to deal with the DA.

19:16.824 --> 19:19.701
Our flower shop perp
lawyered up.

19:29.294 --> 19:30.295
You were right.

19:30.379 --> 19:32.339
Should have taken him out
when we had the chance.

19:32.422 --> 19:33.423
Lieutenant...

19:34.925 --> 19:36.093
I can handle this.

19:36.260 --> 19:37.427
Be careful.

19:47.646 --> 19:49.648
Your son's a lawyer.

19:49.731 --> 19:51.692
You must be very proud.

19:51.775 --> 19:54.778
To begin, let us agree

19:55.779 --> 19:59.032
that through neither
your fault nor mine,

19:59.867 --> 20:02.369
I was not the most
involved father.

20:02.452 --> 20:04.121
Oh, my.

20:04.204 --> 20:07.833
Is this to be an attempt
to start over?

20:08.458 --> 20:11.044
Are you going to take me
down to the fishing hole?

20:11.712 --> 20:14.172
Just know that
whatever your aim,

20:14.256 --> 20:15.799
you have failed.

20:16.133 --> 20:17.551
We're aware
of the Judas coin,

20:17.634 --> 20:19.344
and we will have it
out of circulation

20:19.428 --> 20:21.305
before you can
use it to turn

20:21.388 --> 20:23.682
a single other
heart to darkness.

20:23.765 --> 20:24.933
"Turn"?

20:25.976 --> 20:28.395
The coin doesn't
turn anything.

20:28.812 --> 20:31.315
It simply reveals
what's already there.

20:31.565 --> 20:34.151
The darkness in all of you,

20:35.110 --> 20:37.112
no matter how small the seed.

20:37.195 --> 20:39.781
I'm afraid, sadly,

20:40.782 --> 20:43.493
you underestimate
the good in people.

20:43.577 --> 20:45.037
"Afraid"?

20:46.830 --> 20:49.374
You haven't begun
to know fear.

20:51.585 --> 20:53.253
Or sadness.

20:54.338 --> 20:57.507
I'm glad you survived
that box I put you in,

20:57.591 --> 21:01.053
so that you, too,
can witness first-hand

21:01.845 --> 21:03.722
people's true nature.

21:06.516 --> 21:09.686
Well, if you ever need
an attorney, look me up.

21:10.187 --> 21:13.190
I'm building
quite a client list,

21:14.274 --> 21:17.027
but I can always
make room for family.

21:19.905 --> 21:21.490
Mr. Crane.

21:21.573 --> 21:24.785
I really do believe
I was clear.

21:24.868 --> 21:26.286
Stay away from police work.

21:26.662 --> 21:30.040
Sheriff Reyes,
I have tried to cooperate,

21:30.123 --> 21:32.793
but this country
was founded by men
who fought for nothing

21:32.876 --> 21:34.544
if not individual liberty,

21:35.003 --> 21:39.091
forged by the blood of men
who refused to bow
to a tyrant's will.

21:39.174 --> 21:43.637
And as I stand
in this public house
of law and order,

21:43.720 --> 21:45.764
built to defend
that very liberty,

21:45.847 --> 21:47.849
I declare,

21:47.933 --> 21:50.018
I'm well within
my rights to be here.

21:50.352 --> 21:51.353
Do you?

21:51.436 --> 21:53.855
Because I can't
find any records
you even exist.

21:53.939 --> 21:56.441
And as the person
responsible for the safety,

21:56.525 --> 22:00.779
and therefore liberty,
of this town,
that's a problem.

22:03.532 --> 22:05.033
Well, that's one
that's easily solved.

22:05.117 --> 22:06.868
My identification is at home.

22:08.370 --> 22:10.580
I'll provide it
when next we meet.

22:10.664 --> 22:11.957
You have 24 hours.

22:12.833 --> 22:14.001
Cheers.

22:21.717 --> 22:22.676
Here you go, Lieutenant.

22:22.759 --> 22:25.220
This is all the bomb guy's
personal belongings.

22:26.555 --> 22:27.597
It's a quarter.

22:31.935 --> 22:33.270
Just a quarter.

22:33.353 --> 22:34.521
And a very
popular one today, too.

22:35.230 --> 22:36.690
The perp's lawyer,
just in here

22:36.815 --> 22:38.316
taking a look
at the same thing.

22:40.944 --> 22:42.571
And he switched the coin.

23:19.691 --> 23:21.818
<i>She's never</i>
<i>been on my side.</i>

23:21.902 --> 23:25.614
<i>Time to even the score</i>
<i>and take her out.</i>

23:42.047 --> 23:43.340
Got your call.

23:43.423 --> 23:45.509
I ordered us some beers.

23:49.513 --> 23:50.514
What is it?

23:50.597 --> 23:52.724
Whilst no greater
advocate of revolution

23:52.808 --> 23:55.811
ever shook the walls
of Parliament than Sam Adams,

23:55.894 --> 23:57.813
the man on this bottle
is Paul Revere.

23:57.896 --> 23:59.648
Yeah. Anyway.

23:59.731 --> 24:01.358
Surely your historical
records show that

24:01.441 --> 24:03.443
Adams would never have
rolled up his sleeves.

24:03.527 --> 24:05.112
He was far too aristocratic.

24:05.195 --> 24:07.781
Revere, on the other hand,
was a Minuteman.

24:07.864 --> 24:08.865
Crane.

24:08.949 --> 24:09.991
Right.

24:10.408 --> 24:11.409
Hi.

24:11.493 --> 24:12.661
I just need
to see some ID.

24:13.411 --> 24:15.372
Then your needs
will remain unmet.

24:15.455 --> 24:17.290
I have no identification,

24:17.374 --> 24:19.876
nor indeed money
to pay for my beer if I had.

24:20.168 --> 24:23.213
I fought a war
for independence,
yet I have none.

24:23.880 --> 24:25.882
It's okay,
we're not drinking.

24:28.760 --> 24:29.803
You said it was important.

24:29.886 --> 24:32.556
Yeah. I saw your sister.

24:32.639 --> 24:34.641
She was acting
pretty weird, okay?

24:34.724 --> 24:36.143
Came by my place
to borrow a gun.

24:36.226 --> 24:39.187
Now, I didn't ask,
just showed her a few.

24:39.271 --> 24:41.189
When I went to get more,

24:41.273 --> 24:43.567
she takes off with one
of my high-powered rifles.

24:44.192 --> 24:46.236
Somehow,
Henry got Jenny the coin.

24:46.319 --> 24:48.113
And given your last
encounter with Miss Jenny,

24:48.196 --> 24:51.158
and her feeling
that you chose to
side with the sheriff

24:51.241 --> 24:53.326
on the business
with your mother,
I fear the one

24:53.410 --> 24:55.078
she may be drawn
to betray is...

24:55.162 --> 24:57.706
Me. My sister's
gonna try to kill me.

24:57.789 --> 24:59.749
Whoa. No. No, no, no.

25:01.042 --> 25:02.169
We need to get
to the precinct.

25:02.252 --> 25:03.795
That's where she's
gonna look for me.

25:03.879 --> 25:06.131
Whoa, whoa...
Okay, okay, just hold up.

25:06.214 --> 25:08.216
If you do believe
this coin made

25:08.300 --> 25:10.177
"Miss Jenny" steal my gun...

25:10.260 --> 25:11.303
Which, I take it,
you don't.

25:11.428 --> 25:12.429
What I believe is that

25:12.512 --> 25:14.514
a lot of people like you
are willing to pay six,

25:14.598 --> 25:16.808
sometimes seven figures
for what they believe.

25:16.892 --> 25:19.728
And since you do
believe in this coin,

25:19.811 --> 25:22.856
and if you do manage to
actually get a hold of it,

25:22.939 --> 25:26.776
how do you plan on keeping it
from affecting you?

25:32.991 --> 25:35.076
Stained glass, you say?

25:35.160 --> 25:38.288
A monk in fourth century
Constantinople claimed

25:38.371 --> 25:42.459
the only thing that protects
against this coin
is consecrated glass.

25:42.542 --> 25:44.252
Don't ask me why.

25:44.336 --> 25:46.296
It's obvious why.

25:46.379 --> 25:48.548
Tyre was not only
home to the shekel,

25:48.632 --> 25:50.258
it was also the chief center

25:50.342 --> 25:52.552
of stained glass production
at the time.

25:52.636 --> 25:53.762
Obviously.

25:53.845 --> 25:55.388
What I mean is,
why a piece of glass

25:55.472 --> 25:57.224
would protect you
from a magic coin.

25:58.016 --> 25:59.059
Let's do this.

26:00.560 --> 26:01.603
Have you no respect?

26:01.686 --> 26:03.521
Have you no sense of time?

26:03.605 --> 26:05.357
What, you want to interview
glass cutters here?

26:06.149 --> 26:07.192
Welcome.

26:08.109 --> 26:09.527
How may I help you men?

26:10.153 --> 26:11.780
I wish to confess.

26:19.329 --> 26:21.665
Dana, has my sister
been here?

26:21.748 --> 26:23.458
No, Lieutenant, not today.

26:24.125 --> 26:26.586
Could you track
the recovery system
on her vehicle for me?

26:26.670 --> 26:28.380
She left her cell
at my place.

26:28.463 --> 26:30.131
I want to catch her
before she gets too far.

26:30.215 --> 26:33.093
Sure. Oh, and Sheriff Reyes
was looking for you.

26:33.176 --> 26:34.970
Maybe you can see her
when she gets back?

26:35.262 --> 26:36.304
Back from where?

26:36.388 --> 26:38.265
She's out
at Sterling Forest.

26:38.348 --> 26:39.391
Hunting.

26:39.474 --> 26:40.475
I know,
it sounds kind of funny,

26:40.558 --> 26:42.102
but she's courting
a state official,

26:42.185 --> 26:44.145
trying to goose along some
funding for the department.

26:44.562 --> 26:45.730
Can you just...

26:45.814 --> 26:47.440
Oh, right. Sorry.

26:51.236 --> 26:53.780
How long has it been
since your last confession?

26:53.989 --> 26:55.282
Ooh...

26:55.365 --> 26:57.325
Feels like centuries.

26:57.409 --> 26:58.910
And what has
led you here today?

26:59.911 --> 27:02.038
So many things. Uh...

27:03.790 --> 27:06.251
Well, my son abhors me.

27:06.334 --> 27:08.545
My wife is living
with another man.

27:09.421 --> 27:13.133
I must confess to feeling
a growing hatred in my heart.

27:13.675 --> 27:15.969
I've encountered a fellow
whose arrogance is matched

27:16.052 --> 27:17.595
only by his annoyance.

27:17.679 --> 27:19.723
Now, I'm aware
the laws of the land

27:19.806 --> 27:22.142
forbid me from
cutting him down, but...

27:23.727 --> 27:26.313
Right. Well,
thank you for listening.
That's much better.

27:27.981 --> 27:29.149
All good.

27:33.028 --> 27:34.571
Sorry this
isn't going quicker.

27:34.654 --> 27:35.697
Me, too.

27:38.199 --> 27:39.200
Oh...

27:40.327 --> 27:41.328
Got it.

27:41.411 --> 27:45.123
It says here your sister
is traveling north on 287...

27:46.082 --> 27:47.083
Oh, hey.

27:47.167 --> 27:49.544
Looks like she's near...
Sterling Forest.

27:49.627 --> 27:50.837
Maybe she's
gone hunting, too.

28:17.072 --> 28:18.865
There are some
hunting blinds up this way.

28:18.948 --> 28:20.367
Jenny might be headed there.

28:20.450 --> 28:23.078
You know, you sweep your
eyes side to side as you go,

28:23.161 --> 28:24.746
you flush
a wild turkey in here.

28:24.829 --> 28:28.124
Yes, I am aware
of the habits
of game birds.

28:28.208 --> 28:29.292
Thank you.

28:29.376 --> 28:31.669
I was trained to hunt
by an Abenaki warrior.

28:31.795 --> 28:34.381
And since there
haven't been any
Abenaki Indians in this state

28:34.464 --> 28:35.590
in a couple hundred years,

28:35.673 --> 28:38.009
it might be time to
increase your meds.

28:38.802 --> 28:41.304
I'll have you know...
Let it go, Crane.

28:41.679 --> 28:44.849
I didn't side with Reyes,
even if it looked
like that to Jenny.

28:44.933 --> 28:46.393
I said she
was doing her job.

28:46.476 --> 28:49.437
Perhaps in her present state,
Miss Jenny does
not see it that way.

28:49.521 --> 28:50.814
I know. And I get it.

28:51.481 --> 28:53.191
Even without an evil coin,

28:53.274 --> 28:55.944
telling the friends
from the enemies
gets harder all the time.

28:56.027 --> 28:59.155
That's why we
so appreciated the British
wearing bright red coats.

28:59.781 --> 29:02.117
Unlike that one,

29:02.867 --> 29:04.994
whose true colors
we're yet to know.

29:05.412 --> 29:07.414
But I promise you this,

29:07.497 --> 29:10.083
he cares less for your sister
than he does that coin.

29:10.166 --> 29:11.376
Give him a chance.

29:12.001 --> 29:14.254
Our ranks of allies
are getting thin.

29:14.629 --> 29:16.506
With Irving for some reason
in Henry's clutches,

29:16.589 --> 29:18.758
and that damn coin
in Jenny's,

29:18.842 --> 29:21.052
the only ones we can count on
now are each other.

29:21.136 --> 29:23.263
And Katrina, of course.

29:25.265 --> 29:26.266
And again,

29:26.724 --> 29:29.894
your silence in the matter
of my wife is most telling.

29:31.020 --> 29:32.355
Do you believe
I should not have

29:32.522 --> 29:33.857
allowed her to remain
with the Horseman?

29:34.816 --> 29:35.942
"Allowed" her?

29:38.153 --> 29:39.654
She's, one, a grown woman,

29:39.737 --> 29:41.406
two, a witch,
three, a redhead.

29:41.489 --> 29:43.283
You couldn't have
stopped her if you tried.

29:44.033 --> 29:47.203
I know she's your wife,
but she's also Henry's mother.

29:48.746 --> 29:51.124
You're asking me to
bet my life on whether,

29:51.207 --> 29:53.126
when it counts,

29:53.209 --> 29:55.044
a mother will
turn against her son?

30:04.053 --> 30:05.722
No "bon appétit"?

30:06.431 --> 30:08.391
You have words
enough of your own
when you like.

30:09.392 --> 30:11.060
You have
no need of mine.

30:12.353 --> 30:13.563
Henry has convinced you

30:13.646 --> 30:15.607
you cannot trust
my intentions.

30:16.191 --> 30:17.192
But Henry doesn't...

30:17.275 --> 30:19.277
Don't bother engaging
the Horseman of War.

30:19.736 --> 30:22.155
Your son is
beyond your reach.

30:22.238 --> 30:23.239
Is he?

30:30.288 --> 30:31.498
What are you
playing at now?

30:32.081 --> 30:33.583
Don't you see?

30:33.791 --> 30:37.462
He's moved into
Fredericks Manor,
the house he was born in.

30:38.922 --> 30:40.298
He could choose any house,

30:40.381 --> 30:43.801
and yet he chooses to move
back into the house
where I gave him life.

30:45.094 --> 30:47.430
He wants a connection to me.

30:47.847 --> 30:50.016
He is connected to me.

30:51.100 --> 30:53.061
He always will be.

31:08.201 --> 31:10.453
The Dark Eagle.

31:10.828 --> 31:14.040
The Abenaki Indians
who Benedict Arnold
fought in Quebec

31:14.123 --> 31:15.625
had a nickname
for him.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.460
The Dark Eagle.

31:19.212 --> 31:22.799
Perhaps, unlike me,
they saw the shadow
in Arnold all along.

31:31.808 --> 31:33.810
Miss Jenny is skilled.

31:34.143 --> 31:35.937
She'll choose
a strategic position,

31:36.229 --> 31:38.064
adequate line of sight,

31:38.398 --> 31:40.233
good cover...

31:44.153 --> 31:45.196
There.

31:46.656 --> 31:47.824
Crane,
distract the sheriff.

31:47.991 --> 31:49.951
Hawley, go left.
I'll take right.

32:31.075 --> 32:32.076
Don't do it.

32:33.036 --> 32:34.037
You want to shoot her,

32:34.120 --> 32:36.039
you're gonna have to
shoot through me first.

32:42.587 --> 32:44.297
Miss Jenny! Stop!

32:44.380 --> 32:45.798
Please, please.

32:46.466 --> 32:48.134
I beg you,
surrender your weapon.

32:50.303 --> 32:51.304
No!

32:51.721 --> 32:52.764
Give it to me.

32:54.349 --> 32:55.600
Let me take the shot.

33:02.899 --> 33:04.734
You think you're
the only one that's mad?

33:06.736 --> 33:08.196
I lost my mother, too.

33:08.321 --> 33:09.906
How is this
talking her down?

33:09.989 --> 33:11.491
Let her handle it.

33:11.574 --> 33:13.326
I get so angry
about all of it.

33:13.409 --> 33:15.078
Being taken from her,
hunted by a demon,

33:15.161 --> 33:16.621
this fate that
we have been handed.

33:17.789 --> 33:19.248
I bury it.

33:19.332 --> 33:21.209
It's still there.
Always there. I get it.

33:21.292 --> 33:23.920
But out of curiosity...

33:24.003 --> 33:25.171
Hair trigger.

33:26.214 --> 33:28.716
If either one of us
gives in to this anger,

33:29.592 --> 33:31.594
we'll never know what really
happened to our mother.

33:31.678 --> 33:33.429
We know what
happened to her.

33:33.513 --> 33:36.557
She killed herself
because we were taken by her.

33:42.438 --> 33:43.606
I hated her.

33:46.401 --> 33:48.528
For leaving us.

33:48.778 --> 33:50.405
Taking the coward's way out.

33:52.073 --> 33:53.449
Going crazy.

33:55.827 --> 33:58.204
Reyes may know more.

33:58.287 --> 33:59.539
She could be the key.

34:00.665 --> 34:03.084
Maybe Henry got
that coin to you

34:03.793 --> 34:05.628
to stop us from

34:05.712 --> 34:08.297
knowing the truth that they
don't want us to know.

34:10.883 --> 34:12.510
Jenny...

34:13.344 --> 34:16.764
I need you to use
that rage to beat them.

34:16.848 --> 34:19.934
I am not about to
let them do this to us again.

34:21.602 --> 34:22.812
Are you?

34:34.532 --> 34:35.742
Miss Jenny...

34:44.834 --> 34:45.835
Lieutenant, no!

34:58.389 --> 34:59.766
You all right?
Jenny.

35:04.812 --> 35:06.314
You okay?

35:10.359 --> 35:12.320
It's gonna be okay now.

35:12.862 --> 35:14.655
I'm always on your side.

35:28.002 --> 35:29.045
Mr. Hawley,

35:30.046 --> 35:31.756
thank you
for your assistance.

35:33.382 --> 35:37.136
And I believe
I owe you an apology.

35:52.527 --> 35:53.528
Good evening.

35:53.611 --> 35:56.239
Sorry, like I said,
you still can't
see Frank Irving.

35:56.322 --> 35:59.742
Oh, no,
I wouldn't dream of asking.

35:59.909 --> 36:02.620
That is not
who I'm here to see.

36:02.995 --> 36:03.996
Hi.

36:06.582 --> 36:07.583
Crane?

36:09.377 --> 36:10.920
Hey.

36:11.003 --> 36:13.422
How long have you
been waiting for me?

36:14.924 --> 36:16.801
I have not been
waiting for you at all,

36:17.593 --> 36:20.555
because your attorney
has banned me
and Lieutenant Mills

36:20.638 --> 36:22.181
from seeing you.

36:22.265 --> 36:23.307
Hi.

36:26.561 --> 36:28.437
I don't understand.
Why would he do that?

36:28.521 --> 36:30.106
Because...

36:30.773 --> 36:32.733
You may need
a moment for this.

36:34.235 --> 36:36.612
Because he is
the Horseman of War.

36:36.696 --> 36:38.531
I'm sorry, what?

36:38.614 --> 36:41.868
He is also my son
and many other things.

36:41.951 --> 36:43.703
But the thrust of it is this,

36:43.786 --> 36:45.913
you must not trust him.

36:47.665 --> 36:49.333
He's getting me out.

36:50.126 --> 36:52.086
My family, they need me.

36:52.169 --> 36:53.588
Captain...

36:53.671 --> 36:55.631
I know this is
difficult to accept,

36:55.756 --> 36:57.675
but I believe it
to my very core.

36:58.050 --> 37:00.386
If he wants you out,

37:00.469 --> 37:03.639
the safest place
you can be is in here.

37:16.360 --> 37:17.904
Ma'am, I heard
you wanted to see me.

37:21.908 --> 37:24.076
Your mother's records
from Tarrytown.

37:24.160 --> 37:26.162
Open it or don't.
Just don't say
where you got it.

37:38.716 --> 37:41.260
<i>"I can't see my babies now.</i>

37:41.344 --> 37:43.304
<i>"No, they can't come here.</i>

37:43.679 --> 37:45.723
"They're better
where they are.

37:45.806 --> 37:49.185
"The demons, they followed
me here, it's not safe.

37:49.268 --> 37:50.353
"You got to promise."

37:50.519 --> 37:51.646
Demons?

37:51.729 --> 37:53.064
It's all through here.

37:53.606 --> 37:55.775
Pages of transcripts
with her doctors.

37:57.276 --> 37:59.779
Crane, my mother
was tormented.

37:59.862 --> 38:01.530
Literally tormented,

38:02.365 --> 38:03.741
and was trying to save us.

38:03.824 --> 38:06.160
Everyone thought
she was crazy,
but she wasn't.

38:07.703 --> 38:10.414
Until she went crazy
protecting us.

38:10.498 --> 38:13.876
Moloch pushed her
into the darkness.

38:14.877 --> 38:17.505
She paid the ultimate
price to protect you.

38:18.047 --> 38:19.340
I know.

38:19.423 --> 38:21.384
And it's selfish, but...

38:24.178 --> 38:26.180
Sometimes I wish she would
have made a different choice.

38:26.263 --> 38:27.682
You know?

38:27.765 --> 38:29.558
Stuck it out for us.

38:30.393 --> 38:32.228
I'm certain she wanted to.

38:36.315 --> 38:38.818
After Benedict Arnold's
treason

38:38.901 --> 38:40.945
and his escape
from capture,

38:41.404 --> 38:44.031
he fought for the British
for another year.

38:50.746 --> 38:54.917
<i>We encountered</i>
<i>one another a final time,</i>

38:55.001 --> 38:57.837
<i>old friends,</i>
<i>now on opposite</i>
<i>sides of the battle.</i>

38:59.964 --> 39:02.008
<i>I knew, in one look</i>

39:04.260 --> 39:06.679
<i>that if he could turn back</i>
<i>the pages to a time</i>

39:06.762 --> 39:09.015
<i>before the seeds of</i>
<i>his darkness had taken hold,</i>

39:09.098 --> 39:12.184
<i>and everything he loved</i>
<i>was lost to him,</i>

39:13.185 --> 39:15.896
he would have made that
choice in a heartbeat.

39:28.826 --> 39:30.411
You gotta be kidding me.

39:33.497 --> 39:34.540
Hey.

39:35.291 --> 39:36.834
Ow! Hey, hey!

39:37.251 --> 39:38.836
Whoa! No need for that.

39:39.462 --> 39:40.963
Looking for you guys.

39:41.047 --> 39:44.050
Where's the coin you stole?
Have you sold it already?

39:44.133 --> 39:46.969
No, it's safe.
I'm not selling it.

39:47.053 --> 39:49.513
And why not?
Well, I thought about it.

39:49.597 --> 39:51.432
And then I realized,

39:51.807 --> 39:55.144
if one coin's supposed
to have that kind of power,

39:55.227 --> 39:57.480
imagine what someone would pay
if I had the complete set.

39:57.813 --> 39:58.814
Set?

39:58.898 --> 40:00.900
It's like you reminded me.

40:00.983 --> 40:02.943
Judas got 30 of those coins.

40:03.027 --> 40:05.154
That leaves 29
more of 'em out there.

40:06.405 --> 40:07.448
Anyway.

40:07.531 --> 40:10.826
I felt bad about you guys
ending up with nothing, so...

40:28.511 --> 40:31.180
Falsified
identification documents.

40:34.100 --> 40:37.520
Now I can prove to our
Sheriff Reyes that I exist.

40:37.686 --> 40:39.355
Plus, now,
you can have a beer.

40:39.438 --> 40:42.942
I fear no good comes
from owing a man
like Hawley a debt.

40:43.025 --> 40:45.277
It tells me that,
when it comes down to it,

40:45.361 --> 40:47.113
he's someone that
we can count on.

40:47.196 --> 40:48.531
We shall find out
soon enough.

40:48.739 --> 40:52.409
Just as the coin magnifies
people's darkest impulses,

40:52.827 --> 40:56.831
so war magnifies their
allegiances and loyalties.

41:00.584 --> 41:02.545
What matters now,
more than ever,

41:02.628 --> 41:04.880
is that you and I
stay true.

41:06.048 --> 41:09.051
Trust is the only
currency with any value.

41:10.136 --> 41:13.097
All other forms are
too easily counterfeited.

41:18.435 --> 41:20.229
<i>Everything is in motion now,</i>

41:22.106 --> 41:24.316
<i>the battle lines are drawn.</i>

41:29.738 --> 41:34.243
<i>And on which side</i>
<i>each of the players</i>
<i>fall remains to be seen.</i>

41:40.416 --> 41:41.542
Push!
