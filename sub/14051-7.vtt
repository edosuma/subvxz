00:06.440 --> 00:09.600
The stations are going to take

00:06.440 --> 00:09.600
an almighty battering tonight.

00:09.640 --> 00:13.120
So take your observations, then carry out

00:09.640 --> 00:13.120
a full site check.

00:13.160 --> 00:15.520
Secure everything.

00:15.560 --> 00:19.240
I'll go north. Jennifer, you're east.

00:20.320 --> 00:22.120
Leo, west.

00:23.720 --> 00:25.600
Amber, south for you.

00:26.560 --> 00:30.440
And Damon, you're central.

00:30.480 --> 00:34.560
I want the instruments photographed as back-up

00:30.480 --> 00:34.560
once you've taken the readings.

00:34.600 --> 00:37.600
These conditions may never come round again so let's

00:34.600 --> 00:37.600
get this right.

00:37.640 --> 00:39.560
Once you've got the stats, get yourselves home.

00:39.600 --> 00:42.320
We'll collate everything tomorrow. Stay safe, okay?

00:46.280 --> 00:47.280
Damon?

00:47.840 --> 00:49.320
Can we swap?

00:49.360 --> 00:52.640
-I've just got something to do.

00:49.360 --> 00:52.640
I need to be here.

00:53.760 --> 00:54.880
Please?

01:27.080 --> 01:29.960
NEWSREADER:<i> Latest predictions</i> <i>suggest Hurricane Irma</i>

01:27.080 --> 01:29.960
<i>will make land</i>

01:30.000 --> 01:31.600
<i>around seven o'clock</i> <i>this evening.</i>

01:31.640 --> 01:35.200
Yes, yes, yes, we get it. There's going to be a storm.

01:35.240 --> 01:36.760
He's definitely scared.

01:36.800 --> 01:37.920
It's his first hurricane.

01:38.600 --> 01:41.160
Scared? I survived '87.

01:41.200 --> 01:42.800
You survived 87 hurricanes?

01:42.840 --> 01:47.360
No. 1987. Hmm

01:47.400 --> 01:50.320
I tell you, the roof of my dad's shed was torn off.

01:50.360 --> 01:54.200
Tomato pots and bird feeders strewn across the lawn.

01:54.240 --> 01:55.600
Utter carnage.

02:07.320 --> 02:08.480
Oh, my God.

02:12.560 --> 02:13.920
Come on, come on!

02:17.040 --> 02:18.360
Hello?

02:53.920 --> 02:58.440
Leo Downs. 26. Staff researcher here at the meteorology centre.

03:01.360 --> 03:03.920
This debris. Very spread out, isn't it?

03:05.880 --> 03:07.480
There's something not quite right.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.560
Okay, so Leo Downs is recording meteorology data,

03:13.600 --> 03:16.200
the killer arrives, there's a fight.

03:16.240 --> 03:18.680
A big fight, the place is a mess.

03:18.720 --> 03:21.200
-They must have been.

03:21.240 --> 03:24.040
And yet there are no strained seams on his clothing.

03:24.080 --> 03:26.160
In fact no damage to the clothing of any kind,

03:26.200 --> 03:28.600
no abrasions to the knuckles.

03:30.200 --> 03:33.080
Hang on, this is north, right?

03:33.760 --> 03:35.080
Er, why?

03:35.120 --> 03:37.640
So the debris lies to the south of the Stevenson box.

03:37.680 --> 03:40.440
Okay, so the door was opened, they fight,

03:40.480 --> 03:42.280
crash into it and stuff flies out.

03:42.320 --> 03:44.760
Yeah, but the door on a Stevenson box

03:42.320 --> 03:44.760
always faces north.

03:45.160 --> 03:46.360
Does it?

03:46.400 --> 03:49.080
To stop direct sunlight hitting the thermometer.

03:49.120 --> 03:53.040
There's no way the instruments could have accidentally fallen

03:49.120 --> 03:53.040
like this.

03:55.560 --> 03:56.840
So it's been staged?

04:03.680 --> 04:08.080
If we came to this exact scene, tomorrow, what would you think?

04:08.120 --> 04:09.160
I'd think...

04:10.400 --> 04:12.560
I'd think he'd been caught by the hurricane.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.960
Yeah, there'd be leaves, branches everywhere.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.560
The blood on the pole would have been cleansed.

04:17.600 --> 04:20.800
I think this would look very much like a tragic accident.

04:20.840 --> 04:25.160
So we've found the body before it was intended to be found?

04:25.200 --> 04:31.080
Whoever did this sought to make Hurricane Irma the perpetrator

04:25.200 --> 04:31.080
and concealer of the crime.

04:32.840 --> 04:37.080
We're looking for someone with a sharp and devious

04:32.840 --> 04:37.080
mind, Camille.

04:37.120 --> 04:40.360
-Good luck with that.

04:40.400 --> 04:42.560
That's the dean of the university, Judy Hearst.

04:42.600 --> 04:46.080
She emailed everybody last night telling them

04:42.600 --> 04:46.080
to stay away today.

04:46.120 --> 04:48.520
There's usually 30 odd people around.

04:48.560 --> 04:51.680
She and Mr Downs are the only people on site.

04:51.720 --> 04:54.280
-Yes, Sir.

04:54.320 --> 04:56.680
So, if she's the only one here,

04:56.720 --> 05:00.840
then maybe her finding the body is a double bluff

04:56.720 --> 05:00.840
and she's our killer.

05:00.880 --> 05:02.960
A reasonable theory, but rather annoyingly,

05:03.000 --> 05:05.040
she's the one person who couldn't have done it.

05:05.080 --> 05:06.920
How can you know that?

05:06.960 --> 05:10.280
Because if the killer wanted the hurricane

05:06.960 --> 05:10.280
to conceal the murder,

05:10.320 --> 05:13.560
the last thing you'd do is call the police before

05:10.320 --> 05:13.560
the hurricane hit.

05:14.960 --> 05:16.040
Yes?

05:17.560 --> 05:19.360
I spoke to the team yesterday.

05:19.400 --> 05:21.680
They said the hurricane was powering up,

05:21.720 --> 05:24.240
so I took the decision to close the unit.

05:24.280 --> 05:27.320
But if the unit was closed, why was Mr Downs here?

05:27.360 --> 05:31.320
He's part of a small team that take daily observations.

05:31.360 --> 05:34.040
The meteorology unit have five weather stations.

05:34.080 --> 05:38.600
One here and four at the north, south, east and west points

05:34.080 --> 05:38.600
of the island.

05:38.640 --> 05:41.120
One member of the team goes to each.

05:41.160 --> 05:45.000
So there would have been four other people here

05:41.160 --> 05:45.000
earlier this morning?

05:45.040 --> 05:46.120
Yes.

05:46.160 --> 05:47.680
Their names, please?

05:47.720 --> 05:50.920
Professor Adam King. Jennifer Cheung.

05:50.960 --> 05:54.080
Amber Collins. And Damon Ryan.

05:54.120 --> 05:56.480
Adam will be devastated.

05:56.520 --> 05:59.840
Well, everyone will of course, it's just that Professor King

05:59.880 --> 06:03.680
had taken young Leo under his wing, so to speak.

06:03.720 --> 06:08.240
So, apart from these four people, is it possible that

06:03.720 --> 06:08.240
anyone else

06:08.280 --> 06:11.640
could have gained access to the station where

06:08.280 --> 06:11.640
Mr Downs was killed?

06:11.680 --> 06:15.520
I don't think so. The entrance gates were

06:11.680 --> 06:15.520
locked when I arrived.

06:15.560 --> 06:19.600
So you came to a closed department knowing a hurricane

06:15.560 --> 06:19.600
was approaching.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.080
Why?

06:21.120 --> 06:24.600
Leo wanted to see me. I got a message.

06:26.040 --> 06:27.920
He left it late last night.

06:30.200 --> 06:31.960
<i>Hi, it's Leo Downs.</i>

06:32.000 --> 06:33.600
<i>There's something</i> <i>I need to tell you.</i>

06:33.640 --> 06:35.840
<i>It's really serious</i> <i>and I don't know who to tell,</i>

06:35.880 --> 06:39.240
<i>and well, it could blow</i> <i>the whole department apart.</i>

06:39.280 --> 06:41.160
<i>Look, I'm in for</i> <i>observations tomorrow.</i>

06:41.200 --> 06:45.600
<i>If you meet me at noon,</i> <i>I'll explain. Okay. Bye.</i>

06:45.640 --> 06:49.200
I picked it up this morning and caught the first ferry over.

06:49.240 --> 06:52.960
Have you any idea what the meeting was about,

06:49.240 --> 06:52.960
or what he was referring to?

06:53.680 --> 06:54.680
No.

07:13.280 --> 07:15.560
I understand you and Leo were close.

07:19.520 --> 07:22.920
Well, his father died just under a year ago.

07:22.960 --> 07:26.920
He lost his way a little. We all did what we could.

07:26.960 --> 07:29.640
Some of the others resented that I spent that much time with him,

07:29.680 --> 07:32.120
but it was the least I could do in the circumstances.

07:32.160 --> 07:34.240
Then would you say he had enemies here?

07:34.280 --> 07:37.440
I wouldn't describe him as the most popular

07:34.280 --> 07:37.440
member of the unit.

07:37.480 --> 07:40.000
He tended to keep himself to himself.

07:40.040 --> 07:42.680
What about the rest of the group?

07:40.040 --> 07:42.680
You mentioned some resentment.

07:43.840 --> 07:45.440
Were there any rivalries, perhaps?

07:45.480 --> 07:48.560
Well, there's... There's Jennifer.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.000
Very ambitious.

07:50.040 --> 07:52.280
She saw Leo as competition.

07:52.320 --> 07:54.480
Did you speak to him this morning?

07:54.520 --> 07:57.320
Not really, might have said hello.

07:57.360 --> 08:01.520
He was still sulking because I'd got second author

07:57.360 --> 08:01.520
on the professor's new paper.

08:01.560 --> 08:06.000
Erm, I'm sorry, what does "second author" mean?

08:06.040 --> 08:08.800
It's the credit you get on academic papers.

08:08.840 --> 08:11.880
The professor always goes first and the researchers come after.

08:11.920 --> 08:14.160
The higher you are, the more you're respected.

08:14.200 --> 08:17.880
But Leo Downs thought he should be second author on this paper?

08:17.920 --> 08:21.360
That's just how he was, teacher's little pet.

08:21.400 --> 08:23.200
He moaned about everything.

08:23.240 --> 08:25.880
Then there's Damon. Leo's roommate.

08:25.920 --> 08:27.760
Rather a strange one, Damon.

08:27.800 --> 08:29.560
Not very strong on people skills.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.400
I couldn't stand the little creep.

08:31.440 --> 08:33.080
Excuse me?

08:33.120 --> 08:36.800
We had nothing in common. He was always brown-nosing King.

08:36.840 --> 08:40.200
And he was into nerd stuff. Comic books.

08:36.840 --> 08:40.200
Conspiracy theories.

08:40.240 --> 08:41.800
I mean, the guy was 26.

08:41.840 --> 08:44.080
Come on, grow up, you speccy loser.

08:44.120 --> 08:45.840
KING: And finally Amber.

08:45.880 --> 08:48.760
She's sensitive, shall we say.

08:48.800 --> 08:52.640
She and Leo were in a relationship until quite

08:48.800 --> 08:52.640
recently, I believe.

08:52.680 --> 08:54.520
He dumped me.

08:54.560 --> 08:57.280
Said he wanted to concentrate on his work,

08:57.320 --> 09:01.280
which was, like, so disrespectful.

09:01.320 --> 09:03.960
I don't know why he had to be with Professor King

09:01.320 --> 09:03.960
all the time,

09:04.000 --> 09:06.480
I mean, I could've helped him.

09:06.520 --> 09:09.400
I already bought him some books that he said he didn't have.

09:06.520 --> 09:09.400
I mean...

09:09.440 --> 09:13.000
That doesn't sound like a person who would stop you

09:09.440 --> 09:13.000
doing your work, does it?

09:13.040 --> 09:16.520
-No. -He just made excuses

09:13.040 --> 09:16.520
all the time, like saying

09:16.560 --> 09:20.120
he couldn't work properly with me sitting there watching him.

09:20.160 --> 09:23.640
He said it was unnerving, me staring at him,

09:23.680 --> 09:27.480
but you know, it's not like I was making

09:23.680 --> 09:27.480
a noise or anything.

09:27.520 --> 09:30.080
So when Mr Downs' body was discovered at 11.40,

09:30.120 --> 09:33.320
all four of you were at your respective weather stations,

09:30.120 --> 09:33.320
taking measurements?

09:33.360 --> 09:36.120
Yes, we log data and photograph everything.

09:36.160 --> 09:39.360
And all four weather stations are an equal distance away

09:36.160 --> 09:39.360
from the unit?

09:39.400 --> 09:41.720
Yes. All about a 20 minute drive.

09:41.760 --> 09:44.000
Right, so you left here at?

09:46.280 --> 09:47.360
12.

09:50.160 --> 09:52.080
-Not quite.

09:52.120 --> 09:54.120
End of the month. That's a proof copy.

09:54.160 --> 09:57.200
-An analysis of hurricane

09:54.160 --> 09:57.200
prediction methodology.

09:57.240 --> 10:01.240
Ah! Tell me, is this Irma really going to be the end of the

09:57.240 --> 10:01.240
world, everyone says it is?

10:01.280 --> 10:04.040
Well, it's shaping up to be pretty mighty.

10:04.080 --> 10:05.560
I don't wish to be disrespectful,

10:05.600 --> 10:08.760
but is this really the place for a published professor?

10:08.800 --> 10:11.040
Well, maybe not forever.

10:11.080 --> 10:12.880
The buzz on the book has been good.

10:12.920 --> 10:15.920
I've had enquiries from Yale and Oxford to visit.

10:15.960 --> 10:18.520
But this place has been good for me.

10:18.560 --> 10:21.960
When I took the position, I didn't really know where

10:18.560 --> 10:21.960
I was going.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.360
You know, I used to be a demon proof-reader at college.

10:25.400 --> 10:29.280
Spelling. Punctuation. Grammar. I hunted those blighters down

10:25.400 --> 10:29.280
for fun.

10:29.320 --> 10:32.520
Well, take one. If you can spot anything I'd be grateful. Drink?

10:33.280 --> 10:34.760
Er, no, thank you. Can I ask?

10:37.160 --> 10:39.280
Did Mr Downs mention anything to you about an appointment

10:39.320 --> 10:41.160
he'd made with the dean for today?

10:42.720 --> 10:44.360
No, he didn't.

10:44.400 --> 10:46.160
Why on earth would he want to see the dean?

10:48.200 --> 10:51.360
-Big day tomorrow. Sergeant's exam.

10:48.200 --> 10:51.360
-Yes, please don't remind me.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.680
You'll breeze it. Won't he, sir?

10:53.720 --> 10:58.400
No idea. If he's worked hard enough, it's possible.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.040
So...

11:04.080 --> 11:08.720
...the killer intended the murder to be disguised

11:04.080 --> 11:08.720
by the impending hurricane.

11:08.760 --> 11:12.560
Someone who knew where it would hit and when.

11:12.600 --> 11:14.520
-A meteorologist. -Exactly.

11:14.560 --> 11:16.880
But we have a problem.

11:16.920 --> 11:18.320
All four of them,

11:19.480 --> 11:22.640
Professor King, Jennifer Cheung,

11:22.680 --> 11:26.040
Amber Collins and Damon Ryan,

11:26.080 --> 11:29.760
all set off at exactly 11am.

11:29.800 --> 11:32.840
They drove for around 20 minutes to their respective

11:29.800 --> 11:32.840
weather stations

11:32.880 --> 11:34.960
and took readings.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.360
They all arrived back around noon and as the body

11:35.000 --> 11:38.360
was found at 11.40,

11:38.400 --> 11:41.720
it means they were all accounted for

11:38.400 --> 11:41.720
when the murder took place.

11:41.760 --> 11:43.440
Yeah, very convenient.

11:43.480 --> 11:47.680
Leo Downs swapped his allocated weather station

11:43.480 --> 11:47.680
with Damon Ryan

11:47.720 --> 11:49.280
in order to stay at the unit.

11:49.320 --> 11:52.080
Damon, can we swap? I need to be here.

11:52.120 --> 11:56.720
We assume, because of his meeting with the dean.

11:56.760 --> 11:58.320
Yes.

11:58.360 --> 12:00.800
And we know the others went to their respective

11:58.360 --> 12:00.800
stations because?

12:00.840 --> 12:02.560
We have their completed data charts

12:02.600 --> 12:04.760
and they photographed the instruments as a backup.

12:04.800 --> 12:06.720
Ah!

12:06.760 --> 12:12.320
The cameras are date and time coded and today's

12:06.760 --> 12:12.320
photographic readings

12:12.360 --> 12:16.160
were all taken between 11.25 and 11.35.

12:16.200 --> 12:19.280
CAMILLE: So if the time codes are correct, they all

12:16.200 --> 12:19.280
have an alibi.

12:19.320 --> 12:22.240
But the killer could have changed the time code

12:19.320 --> 12:22.240
on the camera.

12:22.280 --> 12:25.800
Yeah, but even if they did, we have no way of knowing

12:22.280 --> 12:25.800
which one was changed,

12:25.840 --> 12:27.120
so it doesn't help us.

12:27.160 --> 12:30.320
Also we didn't find a camera at the murder scene.

12:30.360 --> 12:31.560
No, we didn't.

12:31.600 --> 12:33.600
Yet we know the victim had one,

12:33.640 --> 12:35.240
because in Damon Ryan's statement,

12:35.280 --> 12:39.360
he said he gave him his clipboard and camera.

12:39.400 --> 12:41.120
So where is it?

12:41.160 --> 12:43.960
If the murderer took it, why? Was it important

12:41.160 --> 12:43.960
enough to kill for?

12:44.000 --> 12:45.880
Sir, the fingerprint reports are back.

12:45.920 --> 12:48.640
Samples taken from the weather station equipment

12:45.920 --> 12:48.640
confirmed matches

12:48.680 --> 12:50.560
for all five members of the unit.

12:50.600 --> 12:54.240
The victim, King, Cheung, Collins and Ryan.

12:54.280 --> 12:55.600
We'd expect them to be there.

12:55.640 --> 12:57.440
And the murder weapon was wiped clean.

12:57.480 --> 13:00.960
And the toy duck had several clean prints,

12:57.480 --> 13:00.960
all matching the victim.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.960
So it did belong to him.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.280
Okay. Doctored camera or not, we need to completely rule out

13:06.320 --> 13:08.800
the possibility that one of our four suspects

13:06.320 --> 13:08.800
could have taken

13:08.840 --> 13:14.000
their readings and got back in time to murder Leo Downs

13:08.840 --> 13:14.000
before 11: 40.

13:14.040 --> 13:15.800
How are we going to do that?

13:15.840 --> 13:18.720
Thank you. Thank you for your cooperation.

13:18.760 --> 13:21.320
Right, stopwatches?

13:23.840 --> 13:26.760
Good. So you drive to your allocated station,

13:23.840 --> 13:26.760
you wait ten minutes

13:26.800 --> 13:31.560
to cover taking the data, then you return

13:26.800 --> 13:31.560
directly to the lodgings.

13:31.600 --> 13:35.040
Chief? If they were trying to get back to kill Leo,

13:35.080 --> 13:38.520
they probably wouldn't have stuck to the speed limit.

13:38.560 --> 13:40.800
Right, yes. You can drive as fast as you can.

13:40.840 --> 13:42.720
Just try not to kill anyone.

13:46.320 --> 13:47.680
I love this job!

13:48.480 --> 13:50.640
Three, two...

13:52.280 --> 13:53.320
Wait!

13:54.160 --> 13:56.680
Go, go, go, go, go!

14:37.240 --> 14:38.960
-One hour.

14:41.320 --> 14:44.800
RICHARD: Well, if the photos are genuine, all our suspects

14:41.320 --> 14:44.800
have an alibi.

14:54.240 --> 14:55.960
What are we looking for exactly?

14:57.200 --> 14:58.200
His camera?

15:00.920 --> 15:02.680
Something to explain the rubber duck?

15:03.360 --> 15:05.520
A motive?

15:05.560 --> 15:08.160
Whatever it is that could blow the department apart.

15:09.160 --> 15:10.720
His father.

15:10.760 --> 15:11.920
RICHARD: He died last year.

15:12.720 --> 15:14.440
Poor thing.

15:14.480 --> 15:18.400
"Glory follows virtue as if it were its shadow."

15:14.480 --> 15:18.400
That's beautiful.

15:18.440 --> 15:19.640
Really? That's Cicero.

15:21.120 --> 15:22.680
Cicero. Roman philosopher.

15:27.360 --> 15:28.440
Hey!

15:30.320 --> 15:31.480
His laptop.

15:36.600 --> 15:37.640
Okay.

15:39.280 --> 15:41.280
That's odd.

15:41.320 --> 15:44.400
There's nothing there. It's empty.

15:41.320 --> 15:44.400
Just a couple of video files.

15:44.440 --> 15:45.600
No work?

15:45.640 --> 15:48.920
No. No work, no photos, no music files.

15:48.960 --> 15:52.080
Either he was very lazy or someone's wiped it.

15:53.240 --> 15:54.560
Let's see the video.

15:58.360 --> 16:02.280
<i>Most people are saying</i> <i>that Irma is going to be</i>

15:58.360 --> 16:02.280
<i>category 2 or 3</i>

16:02.320 --> 16:05.960
<i>direct hit, but my calculations</i> <i>are saying something else.</i>

16:06.000 --> 16:09.560
<i>I think that we're going to see</i> <i>a cat 2 at best.</i>

16:09.600 --> 16:13.680
<i>And I also think the course</i> <i>of the hurricane is going to</i>

16:09.600 --> 16:13.680
<i>see a miss,</i>

16:13.720 --> 16:17.040
<i>some 40 miles</i> <i>north-west of the island.</i>

16:17.080 --> 16:18.480
RICHARD: Not what his professor said.

16:19.320 --> 16:20.600
Hmm, what about the other one?

16:24.720 --> 16:26.880
<i>Hey, Mum.</i>

16:26.920 --> 16:28.440
<i>Sorry I've not</i> <i>called in a while.</i>

16:28.480 --> 16:32.920
<i>Things have been, erm...</i> <i>tricky round here lately.</i>

16:32.960 --> 16:37.360
<i>People have not been</i> <i>behaving well.</i>

16:32.960 --> 16:37.360
<i>It's been lonely.</i>

16:39.640 --> 16:41.720
<i>I've been thinking</i> <i>about home a lot.</i>

16:41.760 --> 16:43.120
<i>I really miss you.</i>

16:44.120 --> 16:45.200
<i>And him.</i>

16:46.600 --> 16:50.840
<i>When I saw Dad last,</i> <i>he talked about no regrets.</i>

16:50.880 --> 16:53.920
<i>"Don't pass up on fun",</i> <i>he said.</i>

16:53.960 --> 16:57.040
<i>"Don't run away from problems</i> <i>you should have faced up to."</i>

16:58.440 --> 17:00.560
<i>Today I'm going to see</i> <i>both of those things through.</i>

17:03.560 --> 17:07.520
<i>Later the serious stuff,</i> <i>but first the fun.</i>

17:07.560 --> 17:09.240
<i>It was this mad idea</i> <i>we had,</i>

17:11.000 --> 17:13.360
<i>and it'll sort of be a way</i> <i>to get closer to him.</i>

17:14.520 --> 17:16.080
<i>One more for Curtis!</i>

17:16.120 --> 17:18.040
RICHARD: Who's Curtis?

17:18.080 --> 17:21.000
<i>Anyway, erm...</i> <i>I'll email you the results.</i>

17:21.880 --> 17:23.000
<i>I love you.</i>

17:23.040 --> 17:24.760
Oh. He seems nice.

17:29.440 --> 17:32.160
What is there to gain, hmm

17:37.560 --> 17:39.640
The dean had one of these in her bag.

17:41.080 --> 17:42.880
Come to think of it, so did the professor.

17:42.920 --> 17:43.960
Drink?

17:46.120 --> 17:49.200
Corporate bump for the Saint Marie

17:46.120 --> 17:49.200
Development Agency.

17:49.240 --> 17:51.480
Ah! Yes, it's been on the local news.

17:51.520 --> 17:55.120
They're trying to get people on side for oil rigs

17:51.520 --> 17:55.120
off the coast.

17:55.160 --> 17:59.080
Hmm, there's a lot of people against the project.

17:59.120 --> 18:03.640
That's Marcus Sweet. A local politician.

17:59.120 --> 18:03.640
He runs the agency.

18:03.680 --> 18:08.600
So Leo circled him, and put this brochure inside

18:03.680 --> 18:08.600
a book about conspiracies?

18:08.640 --> 18:11.680
-Could be.

18:12.720 --> 18:14.280
Let's go check 'em out.

18:23.880 --> 18:26.680
I was thinking, why don't you stay at mine tonight?

18:28.800 --> 18:30.520
To see out the hurricane.

18:30.560 --> 18:32.760
Oh, no, no. No, thanks.

18:32.800 --> 18:35.920
I don't like the idea of you alone in that little

18:32.800 --> 18:35.920
wooden shack.

18:35.960 --> 18:37.800
There's going to be 80 mile an hour winds.

18:37.840 --> 18:39.520
You'll end up in a tree.

18:39.560 --> 18:41.920
Yeah, well the tree's already in the house,

18:39.560 --> 18:41.920
so no change there.

18:41.960 --> 18:43.800
I'm serious. It's not a good idea.

18:45.120 --> 18:47.720
Hello! Hello!

18:47.760 --> 18:51.120
They've probably gone home. Everyone else has.

18:51.160 --> 18:53.080
If everyone in England crawled into a shelter

18:53.120 --> 18:56.480
every time there was a little bit of wind and rain,

18:53.120 --> 18:56.480
we'd never have had an empire.

18:57.320 --> 18:58.640
Come on.

19:02.240 --> 19:06.760
As part of our duties in times of hurricane, we sometimes

19:06.800 --> 19:10.480
go around checking people have the right kinds of

19:10.520 --> 19:13.320
locks and shutters.

19:15.480 --> 19:17.080
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Camille!

19:18.640 --> 19:19.920
What?

19:19.960 --> 19:21.840
Poorly secured doors and windows cause more accidents

19:21.880 --> 19:23.280
in hurricanes than anything else.

19:30.360 --> 19:33.120
-You've just violated

19:30.360 --> 19:33.120
several codes of practice.

19:33.160 --> 19:34.600
I will not be part of this.

19:34.640 --> 19:37.520
Okay, fine. Let's wait 24 hours for a warrant.

19:37.560 --> 19:40.640
By then, the killer could have fled, could have

19:37.560 --> 19:40.640
destroyed evidence.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.200
Shh.

19:42.240 --> 19:44.080
We are paying for this to be secured.

20:09.440 --> 20:12.920
This is a draft feasibility study of the oil

20:09.440 --> 20:12.920
platform project.

20:12.960 --> 20:15.480
Guess who their chief atmospheric consultant is?

20:16.920 --> 20:20.320
Okay, so one of the key hurdles the company has to navigate

20:20.360 --> 20:23.640
is the environmental impact assessment.

20:23.680 --> 20:27.000
And Professor King pops up to say he's satisfied

20:23.680 --> 20:27.000
their deep sea drilling rigs

20:27.040 --> 20:29.040
will survive a hurricane,

20:29.080 --> 20:33.200
and therefore pose no risk to the environment.

20:33.240 --> 20:36.840
Caribbean oil could be big business in the future.

20:36.880 --> 20:39.240
If Leo was going to put these deals in jeopardy,

20:39.280 --> 20:41.280
someone might want him out of the way.

20:41.320 --> 20:46.360
Yeah, but we still need something to prove

20:41.320 --> 20:46.360
a link to the university.

20:54.200 --> 20:55.240
That'll do.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.840
Er, yes. Yes, of course.

21:05.520 --> 21:08.720
I hope we're not interrupting anything?

21:08.760 --> 21:11.240
Not at all, just university business.

21:13.800 --> 21:16.480
And that's exactly what we wanted to talk to you about.

21:16.520 --> 21:18.280
Oh?

21:18.320 --> 21:20.920
Particularly your relationship with the Saint Marie

21:18.320 --> 21:20.920
Development Agency

21:20.960 --> 21:23.440
and its Caribbean oil project.

21:23.480 --> 21:25.320
I have nothing to hide.

21:25.360 --> 21:27.880
The university's budgets have been slashed of late.

21:27.920 --> 21:30.800
Thanks to Professor King, this is an important department

21:30.840 --> 21:33.200
doing important work and it needed saving.

21:33.240 --> 21:38.080
So I hustled and I schmoozed and yes, I managed to secure

21:33.240 --> 21:38.080
funding from the SMDA.

21:38.120 --> 21:39.640
At what price?

21:39.680 --> 21:41.840
It seems convenient that the SMDA keeps

21:39.680 --> 21:41.840
the centre open

21:41.880 --> 21:43.640
and your reports support their work.

21:43.680 --> 21:47.640
I am a man of science, inspector, not a

21:43.680 --> 21:47.640
corporate shill.

21:47.680 --> 21:51.520
Leo Downs had something important to discuss

21:47.680 --> 21:51.520
with the dean.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.560
Perhaps it was your involvement in the project?

21:53.600 --> 21:56.200
-Merely trying to find out

21:53.600 --> 21:56.200
the truth.

21:56.240 --> 21:59.840
As a scientist, inspector, so am I.

21:59.880 --> 22:03.880
Here are my notes and calculations regarding

21:59.880 --> 22:03.880
the proposed oil platform.

22:03.920 --> 22:07.480
If you take the time to read them, you'll see

22:03.920 --> 22:07.480
that my assertion

22:07.520 --> 22:11.760
that the platform is not only safe but would withstand

22:07.520 --> 22:11.760
a category five hurricane

22:11.800 --> 22:14.800
is both factually correct and proven beyond

22:11.800 --> 22:14.800
reasonable doubt.

22:21.320 --> 22:22.480
Do you believe him?

22:22.520 --> 22:24.840
I'll tell you when I've read this.

22:24.880 --> 22:27.560
What matters though is that if the dean already knew about

22:27.600 --> 22:29.520
-his involvement in the oil project,

22:29.560 --> 22:32.320
which she clearly did, then he didn't have a motive

22:29.560 --> 22:32.320
to kill Leo.

22:32.360 --> 22:34.040
So it's another dead end.

22:34.080 --> 22:35.160
Hello?

22:35.200 --> 22:36.920
FIDEL:<i> Hi, it's me.</i>

22:36.960 --> 22:39.600
<i>I managed to chase up</i> <i>the interim autopsy.</i>

22:39.640 --> 22:42.240
It confirms the death was a result of multiple

22:39.640 --> 22:42.240
blows to the head

22:42.280 --> 22:43.720
with a blunt instrument.

22:43.760 --> 22:46.800
<i>But it also says that</i> <i>the X-rays</i>

22:43.760 --> 22:46.800
<i>showed a previous injury.</i>

22:46.840 --> 22:49.520
A broken nose, apparently. Fairly recent.

22:49.560 --> 22:52.000
<i>-Yes.</i>

22:52.040 --> 22:56.000
And they said that Mr Downs came in about five weeks ago.

22:56.040 --> 22:58.680
He said it was the result of an altercation

22:56.040 --> 22:58.680
with another guy.

22:58.720 --> 23:01.880
-We were just messing about.

23:01.920 --> 23:03.920
This is the man you told me you didn't like.

23:03.960 --> 23:07.400
Now you're telling me that you were play fighting with him?

23:07.440 --> 23:11.600
Ah. Or maybe this is what you were fighting about?

23:11.640 --> 23:13.040
Amber Collins was your girlfriend?

23:13.080 --> 23:15.680
Yeah, we split up. Big deal.

23:15.720 --> 23:16.840
-Ask her.

23:16.880 --> 23:18.720
No, I'm asking you.

23:18.760 --> 23:20.880
She'd started hanging out with teacher's little pet.

23:21.360 --> 23:22.440
Leo?

23:23.920 --> 23:25.960
Couldn't have been easy for you.

23:26.000 --> 23:29.120
Your girlfriend hanging out with a "speccy loser"?

23:29.160 --> 23:32.560
-I haven't finished. -Look, I didn't kill him,

23:29.160 --> 23:32.560
all right?

23:32.600 --> 23:36.160
Okay, I didn't like him, but what would I gain

23:32.600 --> 23:36.160
from killing him? Nothing.

23:36.200 --> 23:39.080
Jenny's the one who's getting most from his death.

23:39.120 --> 23:40.960
She's the one who got second author, not me.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.760
Miss Cheung says she earned that position.

23:42.800 --> 23:45.320
Yeah, right She's useless.

23:45.360 --> 23:48.400
Even I'm better than her. Leo was onto her, too.

23:49.280 --> 23:50.440
In what way?

23:50.480 --> 23:53.480
Her step

23:53.520 --> 23:56.800
They're funding the centre. Look, you're the detective,

23:53.520 --> 23:56.800
work it out for yourself!

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
No, I'm not having this.

24:07.040 --> 24:08.680
I knew you'd jump to this conclusion.

24:08.720 --> 24:10.160
Everyone always does.

24:10.200 --> 24:12.480
Poor little rich girl can't achieve anything herself.

24:12.520 --> 24:14.200
Daddy has to have pulled the strings.

24:14.240 --> 24:17.040
-A year ago.

24:17.080 --> 24:19.280
Before or after the SMDA put up funding?

24:20.080 --> 24:21.440
After.

24:21.480 --> 24:23.960
And how did you apply for the job?

24:24.000 --> 24:25.320
Was there an advert or a...

24:25.360 --> 24:26.960
Okay! Okay! Fine!

24:27.000 --> 24:29.160
My dad got me a bloody job here. Big deal.

24:29.200 --> 24:31.840
That little creep found out somehow, someone must

24:29.200 --> 24:31.840
have told him.

24:31.880 --> 24:34.360
And what happened?

24:34.400 --> 24:37.560
See, you're going to jump to all kinds

24:34.400 --> 24:37.560
of conclusions.

24:40.360 --> 24:42.360
He wanted me thrown out.

24:42.400 --> 24:44.840
You're a fake. You don't deserve to be second.

24:44.880 --> 24:47.440
Well, I've got it, so get over it.

24:47.480 --> 24:49.280
Well, I'm going to do something about this.

24:49.320 --> 24:52.480
Drop dead, you whiny little toad.

24:52.520 --> 24:54.720
He wanted to destroy everything I've worked for.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.720
Following your interview with Damon Ryan,

25:03.760 --> 25:06.800
we have a possible motive of jealousy

25:03.760 --> 25:06.800
over Leo's relationship

25:06.840 --> 25:08.680
with Amber Collins.

25:08.720 --> 25:13.240
But was Miss Collins angry enough at being cast aside

25:08.720 --> 25:13.240
to want to kill him?

25:13.280 --> 25:16.080
Or was Leo mixed up in some sort of

25:16.120 --> 25:19.280
corporate conspiracy involving his professor?

25:19.320 --> 25:22.080
And finally, was it about ambition?

25:22.120 --> 25:25.480
One thing that's been curiously absent from all of this,

25:22.120 --> 25:25.480
is Leo's work.

25:25.520 --> 25:28.160
Hmm? Nothing on his computer, nothing in his room.

25:28.200 --> 25:30.080
Anyone else find that strange?

25:30.120 --> 25:33.280
Well, maybe his work is on the university computers.

25:33.320 --> 25:34.840
Could be.

25:34.880 --> 25:36.440
Where's his camera?

25:36.480 --> 25:39.000
And why did he have a rubber duck with him

25:36.480 --> 25:39.000
when he was murdered?

25:39.040 --> 25:41.360
What does "one more for Curtis" mean?

25:41.400 --> 25:43.080
I need to go to the university.

25:43.120 --> 25:46.120
-To check the database

25:43.120 --> 25:46.120
for Leo's work.

25:46.160 --> 25:48.360
You know, maybe we're missing something,

25:48.400 --> 25:51.960
or you know, the reference or mention of this "Curtis".

25:52.000 --> 25:55.160
Sir, the reports are saying that everyone should stay

25:52.000 --> 25:55.160
where they are.

25:55.200 --> 25:57.240
Fidel's right, Chief. You shouldn't go out there.

25:57.280 --> 25:59.360
Leo Downs' mother has already lost her husband.

25:59.400 --> 26:00.720
Now she's lost her son as well.

26:00.760 --> 26:03.160
I'm not stopping for wind and rain.

26:03.200 --> 26:05.680
Excuse me, I won't be long.

26:19.920 --> 26:21.480
Leave it, detective!

26:29.360 --> 26:33.120
Right, I'll check the computer.

26:33.160 --> 26:35.800
You see if you can find a locker in his name.

26:35.840 --> 26:40.400
Any hard copies of work he's submitted.

26:40.440 --> 26:43.560
And check the staff files too, yeah?

26:43.600 --> 26:45.840
See if you can find a Curtis associated with the unit.

26:45.880 --> 26:47.680
No.

26:47.720 --> 26:51.080
We've got about ten minutes before it gets too dangerous

26:47.720 --> 26:51.080
to drive back.

26:51.120 --> 26:52.680
We'd better hurry up then, hadn't we?

27:02.840 --> 27:08.240
Nothing. No locker, no-one called Curtis in any

27:02.840 --> 27:08.240
contact details in the office.

27:08.280 --> 27:11.600
I can't find any of Leo's work. I mean, literally nothing.

27:11.640 --> 27:13.840
It's as if Leo Downs never existed.

27:15.880 --> 27:16.880
We should go.

27:18.800 --> 27:19.840
Now!

27:40.120 --> 27:41.960
I don't think we're going anywhere.

27:55.840 --> 27:59.440
I found Leo's logging details and retrieved his

27:55.840 --> 27:59.440
browsing history.

27:59.480 --> 28:01.320
He watched a lot of internet videos.

28:01.360 --> 28:04.440
-Oh, dear. -No, not that kind of video,

28:01.360 --> 28:04.440
the popular ones.

28:04.480 --> 28:08.680
You know, sneezing panda, furious fat kid,

28:04.480 --> 28:08.680
skateboarding dog?

28:10.120 --> 28:11.480
Okay, come on.

28:11.520 --> 28:14.520
This is a cool one. It's these college kids

28:11.520 --> 28:14.520
in the US.

28:14.560 --> 28:17.360
They fixed a camera and a toy man onto

28:14.560 --> 28:17.360
a weather balloon

28:17.400 --> 28:19.200
and sent it to the edge of space.

28:20.520 --> 28:21.920
BOY: There we go. GIRL: Amazing.

28:26.320 --> 28:27.360
Pause that a second.

28:30.560 --> 28:33.520
Leo had all the equipment to launch a weather balloon.

28:33.560 --> 28:35.760
Helium, balloons, radiosondes.

28:36.440 --> 28:37.840
What's a radiosonde?

28:41.080 --> 28:42.760
One of these, look.

28:42.800 --> 28:45.360
They contain the equipment that hangs below weather balloons.

28:45.400 --> 28:48.120
Leo said in his video he was going to do

28:45.400 --> 28:48.120
something fun and mad

28:48.160 --> 28:51.440
That he and his father had talked about, something to get

28:48.160 --> 28:51.440
him closer to his dad.

28:51.480 --> 28:55.120
-In heaven. -What if launching the duck

28:51.480 --> 28:55.120
was the mad idea?

28:56.320 --> 28:58.760
Okay. So who's Curtis?

28:58.800 --> 29:00.880
Okay, right, let's think about this logically.

29:00.920 --> 29:04.880
-Up.

29:04.920 --> 29:07.680
-Yeah, for a while. -But then when it reaches

29:04.920 --> 29:07.680
the upper atmosphere,

29:07.720 --> 29:10.360
-the helium expands, the balloon bursts.

29:07.720 --> 29:10.360
-So it'll come down.

29:10.400 --> 29:11.760
Right, where

29:11.800 --> 29:13.120
More likely in the sea.

29:13.160 --> 29:14.520
Good. Yes, yes, the sea!

29:14.560 --> 29:17.840
Right, so do a search er, sea, Curtis, duck.

29:23.720 --> 29:25.520
No way.

29:25.560 --> 29:28.360
In 1992, a container ship hit rough seas

29:28.400 --> 29:30.960
and several containers fell into the Pacific.

29:31.000 --> 29:35.040
In one of those containers were 28,000 bath toys.

29:35.080 --> 29:39.520
Oceanographer Curtis Ebbesmeyer saw a unique opportunity

29:35.080 --> 29:39.520
to track

29:39.560 --> 29:42.480
the ocean's currents using the ducks.

29:42.520 --> 29:45.960
So if this fellow landed in the ocean, it would be

29:42.520 --> 29:45.960
"one more for Curtis".

29:46.000 --> 29:48.760
That's really sweet. But how does it help?

29:48.800 --> 29:51.480
Well, Leo said he was going to email the results

29:48.800 --> 29:51.480
to his mother.

29:51.520 --> 29:56.680
-A camera.

29:56.720 --> 29:59.520
The camera! The camera was attached to the radiosonde,

29:59.560 --> 30:01.880
but the duck wasn't fixed properly.

30:01.920 --> 30:04.080
Maybe he didn't have a chance to secure it

30:04.120 --> 30:05.840
because he saw his attacker approaching.

30:05.880 --> 30:07.880
But Camille, what if the camera was recording?

30:07.920 --> 30:09.640
-It might have caught something. -Yeah.

30:09.680 --> 30:12.600
A glimpse of the killer. Their voice. The answer

30:09.680 --> 30:12.600
could be on that camera.

30:12.640 --> 30:14.760
Yes, but how are we going to find it?

30:14.800 --> 30:19.840
Right, the radiosonde emits a signal, yeah?

30:22.000 --> 30:23.920
When one of these receivers is in range...

30:25.320 --> 30:26.360
...it'll pick it up.

30:28.120 --> 30:31.680
Okay! But we've just said it will most likely be

30:28.120 --> 30:31.680
in the sea.

30:31.720 --> 30:33.000
Yeah, that is a problem.

30:33.040 --> 30:37.240
Er, right, look ...

30:37.280 --> 30:39.160
What if it didn't make it to the sea?

30:41.000 --> 30:45.880
Okay, Leo launched the weather balloon here. Right?

30:45.920 --> 30:47.960
The centre of the island.

30:48.000 --> 30:52.160
Erm, the prevailing wind was northerly, so in other words,

30:48.000 --> 30:52.160
blowing from the north.

30:52.200 --> 30:54.680
If it landed anywhere on land, it will be somewhere here.

30:56.240 --> 30:58.080
This, that's where we need to look.

30:58.120 --> 31:00.760
What? But you can't get out there now!

31:00.800 --> 31:01.920
Sir! Stop!

31:03.400 --> 31:05.160
Stop! You'll get killed.

31:07.520 --> 31:10.120
-The answer, Camille! -We'll have to wait.

31:10.160 --> 31:11.240
I can't!

31:22.440 --> 31:23.480
Hello?

31:27.040 --> 31:28.480
Phones are dead.

31:28.520 --> 31:30.160
Yeah. Great.

31:30.200 --> 31:32.640
You know the best thing you can do now is sleep.

31:32.680 --> 31:34.760
Your brain needs rest before the exam.

31:34.800 --> 31:38.080
No, no, no. I can't, I've tried and it feels like

31:34.800 --> 31:38.080
I'm sleeping on duty.

31:39.920 --> 31:43.440
You know what, I think I'll do some more revision.

31:53.080 --> 31:54.600
This one is ice cold.

31:54.640 --> 31:57.720
Put it on your face, it'll help with the swelling.

31:57.760 --> 32:00.760
-Ow. -Yeah, I told you not to go

31:57.760 --> 32:00.760
out there.

32:00.800 --> 32:03.640
Look, there was a camera at the scene.

32:03.680 --> 32:07.120
Hmm? It could have recorded the murder

32:03.680 --> 32:07.120
or captured something.

32:07.160 --> 32:08.840
I think that's worth finding, don't you?

32:08.880 --> 32:11.720
Yes, just maybe not in the middle of a hurricane!

32:11.760 --> 32:13.680
It'll be getting wet. What if it's damaged?

32:13.720 --> 32:19.280
All we can do right now is what everybody else on

32:13.720 --> 32:19.280
this island is doing. Sit tight.

32:19.320 --> 32:21.040
It just feels like we're close.

32:21.080 --> 32:23.440
It will keep, there's nothing else we can do.

32:26.280 --> 32:27.320
-Ow! -Oh, come on.

32:29.160 --> 32:31.640
A case is like a tent. Ow!

32:34.360 --> 32:37.400
I was saying, a case is like a tent, Detective.

32:37.440 --> 32:39.960
There's always a corner you can peg out

32:37.440 --> 32:39.960
a little bit further

32:40.000 --> 32:42.480
to get the canvas that little bit tauter.

32:42.520 --> 32:43.960
Where did you get that one from?

32:47.360 --> 32:50.160
Hated it. A caravan man.

32:50.200 --> 32:52.560
Of course the analogy doesn't really work with a caravan.

32:52.600 --> 32:55.080
You can't peg a caravan out, can you?

32:55.120 --> 32:56.960
I suppose you could extend the legs...

32:57.000 --> 32:59.880
Okay. Do you want some crisps?

32:59.920 --> 33:03.080
-The vending machine.

33:03.120 --> 33:05.960
-The electricity's off. -I've got my own ways.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.480
No more criminal damage, Camille.

33:07.520 --> 33:08.960
I can't keep turning a blind eye.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.080
So you don't want anything? Fine.

33:14.720 --> 33:17.400
A bar of chocolate would be nice.

33:17.440 --> 33:20.520
Leave the money in that little coin rejecty thing.

33:35.880 --> 33:37.400
Er, what if they had an accomplice?

33:37.440 --> 33:40.280
Someone who took the photographs while they committed the murder?

33:40.320 --> 33:42.600
What if they took the photos yesterday?

33:42.640 --> 33:44.720
The data correlates today's weather.

33:44.760 --> 33:49.080
They could have changed the reading, used an ice cube

33:44.760 --> 33:49.080
to cool the...

33:49.120 --> 33:51.200
You've been talking for two hours.

33:51.240 --> 33:53.080
-Yes.

33:53.120 --> 33:54.920
Sorry. Sorry.

34:01.400 --> 34:03.000
Have you ever stayed in a caravan?

34:04.800 --> 34:08.600
Er, luckily my life's not hit those depths yet.

34:08.640 --> 34:11.200
It's what this reminds me of, you know?

34:11.240 --> 34:13.480
A rainy Saturday afternoon in a caravan,

34:15.000 --> 34:17.520
Dad watching the racing on a black and white TV.

34:17.560 --> 34:20.480
Mum boiling something to death on the little stove.

34:20.520 --> 34:25.280
Rain lashing the roof, the whole room swaying

34:20.520 --> 34:25.280
in the wind.

34:25.320 --> 34:28.400
Why do the British choose such depressing

34:25.320 --> 34:28.400
holidays to go on?

34:28.440 --> 34:29.880
Hey, I loved it.

34:29.920 --> 34:34.080
That smell, you know, that caravan smell.

34:34.120 --> 34:36.120
I tell you what, if you ever

34:34.120 --> 34:36.120
come to England,

34:36.160 --> 34:38.320
I'll take you to a caravan in Clacton for the weekend.

34:39.880 --> 34:41.120
I can't wait.

34:44.160 --> 34:46.000
God, I suddenly feel homesick.

34:48.560 --> 34:51.760
I'm even missing my Dad. Good God, what's wrong with me!

34:51.800 --> 34:53.280
You know, I really should phone him.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.800
Is he like you?

34:55.840 --> 34:58.440
God, no.

34:59.760 --> 35:02.880
Actually, my Dad was the reason I became a policeman.

35:02.920 --> 35:07.600
I suppose I could've been an academic like Leo, but, erm,

35:07.640 --> 35:11.360
he didn't think a knowledge of history brought that much

35:07.640 --> 35:11.360
of practical use to the world.

35:13.000 --> 35:16.840
Growing up, I was not unlike Leo Downs.

35:16.880 --> 35:18.160
Always on the periphery.

35:18.200 --> 35:19.960
Never really at the centre of things.

35:21.960 --> 35:24.440
I suppose that's why I like puzzles.

35:24.480 --> 35:27.040
Generally, they're things you can do on your own.

35:27.080 --> 35:28.360
But you don't have to any more.

35:29.880 --> 35:30.920
You have me.

35:33.800 --> 35:36.480
Yes, yeah, right.

35:40.560 --> 35:43.040
My discomfort?

35:40.560 --> 35:43.040
-Yes.

35:44.160 --> 35:45.800
Well, at least you're honest about it.

35:45.840 --> 35:49.280
Well, you're...you're so pompous sometimes,

35:49.320 --> 35:52.320
I like it when you're just human.

35:58.600 --> 35:59.640
So what about now?

36:00.760 --> 36:03.520
Do you think your Dad is proud of you?

36:03.560 --> 36:05.600
That's a difficult question to answer, really.

36:05.640 --> 36:08.480
Erm...you know,

36:08.520 --> 36:11.280
when I'm not around, I suspect he is.

36:11.320 --> 36:12.360
But, erm...

36:13.560 --> 36:15.160
...when I'm there, I can almost feel

36:15.200 --> 36:17.160
the disappointment radiating off him.

36:18.800 --> 36:23.040
Maybe he just finds it hard to express his emotions.

36:25.160 --> 36:27.640
You must get it from somewhere.

36:27.680 --> 36:29.880
No, I think it's genuine disappointment.

36:36.440 --> 36:39.160
-Look, I'm sorry if I'm a bit... You know.

36:36.440 --> 36:39.160
-Don't be.

36:42.440 --> 36:43.560
Can you keep a secret?

36:44.760 --> 36:45.800
Yeah.

36:46.400 --> 36:47.720
I quite like it.

36:55.200 --> 36:57.320
And this was nice. Well, the Land Rover's here

37:23.400 --> 37:25.520
so they must be, too.

37:45.840 --> 37:46.960
Morning.

37:55.800 --> 37:59.280
Yes. Yeah, yeah, a little.

37:59.320 --> 38:02.320
It was a bit windy, but I'd hardly call it

37:59.320 --> 38:02.320
a hurricane,

38:03.120 --> 38:04.480
not like '87.

38:04.520 --> 38:06.920
You're right, it wasn't.

38:06.960 --> 38:11.680
-It missed us, skimmed past

38:06.960 --> 38:11.680
around 40 miles north-west.

38:11.720 --> 38:13.760
-We're very lucky. -Hmm.

38:14.920 --> 38:15.960
We went past your shack,

38:17.120 --> 38:19.400
it still took a bit of a battering, though.

38:19.440 --> 38:20.920
You mustn't tell anyone...

38:22.640 --> 38:26.760
Er, Camille! Er, Sergeant Bordey!

38:28.000 --> 38:30.760
Come on! No time for sleep!

38:30.800 --> 38:34.000
We are going balloon hunting.

38:34.040 --> 38:37.560
Take these and I will explain on the way.

38:46.440 --> 38:49.560
Stop! Stop! Stop!

39:06.720 --> 39:08.440
Fantastic!

39:11.400 --> 39:14.960
<i>Hey, Dad! Big day today.</i>

39:15.000 --> 39:17.760
<i>I'm going to make you proud,</i> <i>you just watch.</i>

39:17.800 --> 39:20.840
<i>But first... Space duck!</i>

39:25.000 --> 39:27.120
<i></i> -CAMILLE: It's the killer!

39:27.160 --> 39:30.840
<i>Go away. It's over.</i> <i>The proof's safely hidden.</i>

39:30.880 --> 39:32.920
RICHARD: What proof

39:36.200 --> 39:38.600
-No voice. No glimpse. -RICHARD: No murderer.

39:38.640 --> 39:41.240
Oh, great, now we're back to square one.

39:43.120 --> 39:44.920
Lines are back up.

39:44.960 --> 39:46.920
Honore Police Station.

39:46.960 --> 39:50.240
Juliet... Yes, hi. How was it?

39:50.280 --> 39:52.800
He had proof of something safely hidden.

39:52.840 --> 39:54.880
Why haven't we found it?

39:54.920 --> 39:59.760
We've been through his laptop, through the university system,

39:54.920 --> 39:59.760
his room, his locker.

39:59.800 --> 40:01.560
We didn't find anything.

40:01.600 --> 40:06.200
He must have hidden it somewhere else, somewhere

40:01.600 --> 40:06.200
significant to him.

40:06.240 --> 40:07.920
Yes, put her on, I'd like to talk to her.

40:13.120 --> 40:14.960
Leo, West.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.840
Can we swap? I really need to be here.

40:20.120 --> 40:22.920
Mm

40:24.680 --> 40:26.280
-One hour.

40:32.160 --> 40:33.880
What a good girl you are.

40:33.920 --> 40:36.520
Daddy misses you, darling. Yes, I do.

40:36.560 --> 40:37.680
Hey, Dad!

40:37.720 --> 40:38.760
Fathers...

40:40.600 --> 40:42.480
This has all been about his Dad, hasn't it?

40:42.520 --> 40:43.840
That's where we need to look.

40:54.560 --> 40:57.520
-Police business!

41:12.600 --> 41:13.600
Ha!

41:20.960 --> 41:22.560
What is this

41:22.600 --> 41:24.440
This must be the hidden proof, right?

41:24.480 --> 41:27.000
Papers. Scientific reports. Charts.

41:27.040 --> 41:28.880
Equation. Hurricane modelling systems.

41:28.920 --> 41:30.960
If it's just university work, why he hidden it?

41:31.000 --> 41:32.680
And why would someone kill for it?

41:32.720 --> 41:35.680
Wait. This looks familiar.

41:35.720 --> 41:38.920
Things are underlined, highlighted...

41:38.960 --> 41:42.480
Okay, we know the killer must have changed the time code

41:38.960 --> 41:42.480
on their camera.

41:42.520 --> 41:46.000
-Yes, but we don't know which one.

41:42.520 --> 41:46.000
-Well, maybe we do...

41:46.040 --> 41:48.560
Maybe the answer's been right in front of us

41:46.040 --> 41:48.560
all the time.

41:49.200 --> 41:51.240
Time! What time is it?

41:51.280 --> 41:52.280
Just gone 11.

41:53.800 --> 41:55.440
Wait, don't do that...

42:00.280 --> 42:03.760
CAMILLE: Are you going to tell me where we're going?

42:03.800 --> 42:07.800
-RICHARD: "Glory follows virtue as if it were its shadow."

42:03.800 --> 42:07.800
-Er...

42:24.400 --> 42:26.720
Oh, for God...

42:26.760 --> 42:30.120
300 days a year, you shine.

42:30.160 --> 42:31.840
Ten hours a day!

42:33.080 --> 42:34.320
And the one time

42:35.160 --> 42:37.360
I actually want you to shine,

42:38.080 --> 42:39.240
you go in!

42:53.960 --> 42:55.000
Thank you.

43:03.720 --> 43:07.280
I want to talk today about Leo Downs.

43:07.320 --> 43:09.200
The last thing he did on this earth

43:09.240 --> 43:12.560
was to diligently collect data from a weather station.

43:12.600 --> 43:16.800
Then to launch a weather balloon in remembrance of his father.

43:16.840 --> 43:18.360
While doing this, he was murdered...

43:19.280 --> 43:20.640
...by someone in this room.

43:23.800 --> 43:27.040
To discover the truth, we had to go to all points

43:23.800 --> 43:27.040
of the compass.

43:27.680 --> 43:29.320
Literally.

43:29.360 --> 43:31.960
We found a scene that was staged.

43:32.000 --> 43:36.880
Everything pointed towards his assailant being one

43:32.000 --> 43:36.880
of his colleagues.

43:36.920 --> 43:41.840
Professor King was involved in a controversial scheme

43:36.920 --> 43:41.840
many people disapproved of.

43:41.880 --> 43:45.520
Then we had the jilted girlfriend, the ambitious rival

43:46.400 --> 43:48.680
and the jealous house mate.

43:48.720 --> 43:50.400
But how could any of you have done it?

43:50.440 --> 43:54.280
You were all miles away at the other weather stations.

43:54.320 --> 43:58.440
Proof came in the form of a series of photographs,

43:58.480 --> 44:01.960
very conveniently dated and timed.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.160
It didn't take a genius to work out that the killer

44:04.200 --> 44:07.920
had almost certainly reset the clock on their camera

44:04.200 --> 44:07.920
to provide an alibi,

44:09.200 --> 44:11.200
but we had no way of knowing which one...

44:13.200 --> 44:14.520
...until now.

44:16.640 --> 44:19.880
Then there was motive that was puzzling, too.

44:19.920 --> 44:22.680
Yes, there were petty squabbles within the unit,

44:22.720 --> 44:26.000
accusations of favouritism, affairs of the heart.

44:26.040 --> 44:30.520
But none of them felt like a strong enough

44:26.040 --> 44:30.520
motive for murder.

44:30.560 --> 44:34.200
Except one. Leo Downs had arranged to see the Dean,

44:34.240 --> 44:38.160
saying he had information that would blow the department apart.

44:38.200 --> 44:40.000
But what was it that he'd discovered?

44:40.040 --> 44:42.680
As the Dean already knew about the Professor's

44:40.040 --> 44:42.680
favourable report

44:42.720 --> 44:44.400
on the proposed oil platform,

44:44.440 --> 44:47.280
in fact she'd clearly encouraged it,

44:44.440 --> 44:47.280
it was unlikely to be that,

44:47.320 --> 44:50.120
so, what else could it be?

44:50.160 --> 44:52.600
And who would be willing to kill Leo

44:52.640 --> 44:55.360
in order to prevent him revealing whatever it was?

44:56.240 --> 45:00.040
We found the answer in his work.

45:01.160 --> 45:03.920
I think you'll find that's mine.

45:03.960 --> 45:06.080
-I know my own work.

45:06.120 --> 45:10.000
Yes, I read your book. No mistakes. I was impressed.

45:10.040 --> 45:13.920
See, you can then imagine how surprised I was to find

45:10.040 --> 45:13.920
a manuscript,

45:13.960 --> 45:19.520
hidden on a memory stick identical, virtually word

45:13.960 --> 45:19.520
for word.

45:21.320 --> 45:24.120
Yet written by Leo Downs.

45:24.160 --> 45:27.000
You see, Leo Downs was a brilliant meteorologist.

45:27.040 --> 45:30.040
He even predicted that the hurricane would miss

45:27.040 --> 45:30.040
the island by 40 miles

45:30.080 --> 45:32.280
to the north-west, which indeed it did.

45:32.320 --> 45:34.680
You spent time with him so you could steal his work.

45:34.720 --> 45:36.360
And when he discovered what you were doing,

45:36.400 --> 45:39.120
you murdered him to protect your burgeoning reputation.

45:40.360 --> 45:43.760
You felt the net closing in.

45:43.800 --> 45:46.800
Encouraged by the Dean to promote the career

45:43.800 --> 45:46.800
of Jennifer Cheung

45:46.840 --> 45:48.560
to protect her funding,

45:48.600 --> 45:52.520
you knew that Mr Downs was reaching the end

45:48.600 --> 45:52.520
of his tether,

45:52.560 --> 45:55.120
that you would have to deal with him permanently.

45:55.160 --> 45:58.640
The hurricane provided the ideal opportunity.

45:58.680 --> 46:02.800
When you came to Saint Marie, you weren't going anywhere,

45:58.680 --> 46:02.800
your words.

46:03.960 --> 46:08.000
Somehow, miraculously, you bloomed

46:08.040 --> 46:11.080
into a meteorologist at the top of his profession.

46:11.120 --> 46:13.600
Books, visits to Yale and Oxford,

46:13.640 --> 46:16.480
lucrative consultancies for the likes of the SMDA.

46:16.520 --> 46:19.680
What happened

46:19.720 --> 46:24.480
Or was it that you discovered a meek researcher whose

46:19.720 --> 46:24.480
brilliant ideas you could steal?

46:24.520 --> 46:26.960
You're not a Professor, Mr King.

46:27.000 --> 46:28.880
You're a plagiarist. A plagiarist and a murderer.

46:30.840 --> 46:33.680
That is a disgusting accusation.

46:33.720 --> 46:37.560
You have no understanding of how things work

46:33.720 --> 46:37.560
in the academic world.

46:37.600 --> 46:38.840
I understand what theft is.

46:38.880 --> 46:41.800
In academia, authorship is shared.

46:41.840 --> 46:43.920
Yours is the only name I see on the title page.

46:43.960 --> 46:46.280
There's no case to answer here.

46:46.320 --> 46:48.480
Plagiarism cases never stick.

46:48.520 --> 46:51.960
Students, researchers, they all imagine

46:52.000 --> 46:53.880
that they've done more work than they have.

46:53.920 --> 46:56.600
Is that what you told Mr Downs when he first confronted you?

46:56.640 --> 46:58.880
Plagiarism is abuse, Professor.

46:58.920 --> 47:01.880
It works in exactly the same way.

47:01.920 --> 47:05.960
You originally assigned Leo to the West station,

47:01.920 --> 47:05.960
didn't you?

47:06.000 --> 47:08.400
KING: Leo, West.

47:08.440 --> 47:11.200
RICHARD: Out there he'd have been isolated, alone.

47:11.240 --> 47:12.760
A much easier prospect.

47:12.800 --> 47:15.760
Guaranteed not to be found till after the hurricane.

47:15.800 --> 47:17.200
But then he swapped.

47:17.240 --> 47:19.120
Damon! Can we swap?

47:19.160 --> 47:21.920
I've just got something to do, I need to be here.

47:21.960 --> 47:24.480
RICHARD:<i> After Leo</i> <i>swapped with Damon,</i>

47:24.520 --> 47:27.400
<i>you knew you had to</i> <i>take a calculated risk</i>

47:24.520 --> 47:27.400
<i>and kill him here.</i>

47:27.440 --> 47:30.880
You said you were going to the north weather station,

47:27.440 --> 47:30.880
but that was a lie.

47:30.920 --> 47:32.760
You went nowhere.

47:32.800 --> 47:36.280
You actually stopped your car just outside the perimeter

47:32.800 --> 47:36.280
and walked back.

47:40.520 --> 47:43.160
<i>You waited</i> <i>until the time was right...</i>

47:43.200 --> 47:47.240
Hi, Dad. Big day today, I'm going to make you proud.

47:47.280 --> 47:49.760
Just watch. But first...

47:51.120 --> 47:52.240
Space Duck.

47:56.400 --> 47:58.560
What do you want? Go away.

47:58.600 --> 48:01.040
It's over. The proof's safely hidden.

48:07.200 --> 48:10.880
You then staged the scene to make it look like

48:07.200 --> 48:10.880
hurricane damage.

48:10.920 --> 48:14.800
Your cunning scheme to make Mr Downs' death

48:10.920 --> 48:14.800
look like misadventure

48:14.840 --> 48:18.560
would most likely have worked had Mrs Hearst not come in...

48:18.600 --> 48:22.040
No! I was at the North weather station.

48:22.080 --> 48:27.400
Yes. And here is the photograph you took on the day

48:22.080 --> 48:27.400
of the murder.

48:27.440 --> 48:31.480
And here is one I took an hour ago.

48:31.520 --> 48:34.800
At the North weather station. Exactly the same position.

48:31.520 --> 48:34.800
Exactly the same time

48:34.840 --> 48:36.760
you say you took yours.

48:36.800 --> 48:38.640
But there's a difference, isn't there?

48:38.680 --> 48:42.240
One a lay person might not see, but one I'm sure a meteorologist

48:38.680 --> 48:42.240
would notice.

48:43.880 --> 48:45.480
Longer shadow.

48:45.520 --> 48:48.280
RICHARD: There's a longer shadow in the Professor's photograph.

48:48.320 --> 48:51.760
Can anyone estimate the time the professor's photograph

48:48.320 --> 48:51.760
was really taken?

48:52.600 --> 48:56.760
Earlier than 11.30. 8, 9am.

48:56.800 --> 48:58.920
RICHARD: You took your photograph

48:56.800 --> 48:58.920
before you came to work,

49:00.040 --> 49:01.960
leaving you free to murder Mr Downs.

49:05.880 --> 49:08.800
"Glory follows virtue as if it were its shadow."

49:13.200 --> 49:15.840
Dwayne, Fidel, do the admin.

49:29.520 --> 49:32.080
-Good news, Fidel. -The test centre's

49:29.520 --> 49:32.080
been blown away?

49:32.120 --> 49:34.520
No, no. Fully functional. Can't wait to see you.

49:34.560 --> 49:36.600
Your exam starts at 3.30.

49:36.640 --> 49:39.480
But I haven't slept. I don't know anything.

49:39.520 --> 49:43.960
-You'll be fine. -Yes, you go get them, tiger!

49:44.000 --> 49:47.400
-I don't know.

49:53.600 --> 49:55.640
I thought you said you weren't like your father.

49:56.040 --> 49:57.680
Hmm?

49:57.720 --> 49:59.000
A little encouragement?

50:03.560 --> 50:04.600
Oh!

50:12.760 --> 50:17.400
Erm, Fidel. For you.

50:17.440 --> 50:19.080
It's the one I took all my exams with.

50:21.440 --> 50:23.880
You've come on leaps and bounds lately.

50:23.920 --> 50:25.880
You've studied thoroughly, I've seen you.

50:27.080 --> 50:28.720
You're ready.

50:28.760 --> 50:30.240
Go get your stripes.

50:31.280 --> 50:32.400
Good luck, Fidel!

50:37.160 --> 50:38.200
A pencil?

50:46.280 --> 50:49.080
So

50:49.120 --> 50:50.960
No, I'll call him later.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.040
We've just had a near miss with a major hurricane.

50:53.080 --> 50:55.120
Don't you think he's going to know that?

50:55.160 --> 50:56.680
We're on the other side of the world.

50:56.720 --> 50:59.000
And don't you think he checks the weather?

50:59.040 --> 51:00.280
He's English, right? You don't know my dad.

51:05.400 --> 51:09.040
Drinks all afternoon, says he won't have a clue.

51:09.080 --> 51:10.080
Deal.

51:13.680 --> 51:15.480
Dad. Hello. How are you?

51:16.720 --> 51:18.000
Yeah, fine, yeah.

51:20.000 --> 51:21.360
No, no, it missed...

51:23.560 --> 51:25.880
Well, I mean a bit of damage, but nothing much...

51:27.000 --> 51:29.440
Oh, nothing like '87...

51:29.480 --> 51:31.160
No, no, yeah, the shed roof.

51:31.200 --> 51:33.240
I know, I told them here, they couldn't believe it.
