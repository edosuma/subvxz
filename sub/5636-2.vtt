WEBVTT

00:01.126 --> 00:03.037
Learning to fly this thing, Morty,

00:03.128 --> 00:04.083
is gonna be
really liberating.

00:04.171 --> 00:05.582
You know, you're
gonna be free

00:05.672 --> 00:07.003
to go on all kinds of errands for me.
- Cool.

00:07.090 --> 00:08.251
See that planet
right there?

00:08.342 --> 00:09.878
Don't fly too close
to that planet.

00:09.968 --> 00:11.333
Someone will come out and
try to wash your windshield.

00:12.638 --> 00:14.424
Hold on.

00:14.515 --> 00:15.880
Yeah?
Yeah, I have it.

00:15.974 --> 00:17.214
Where do you
want to meet?

00:17.309 --> 00:18.390
All right, cool.

00:18.477 --> 00:19.842
All right, Morty,
lesson's over.

00:19.937 --> 00:21.177
We got some business
to attend to

00:21.271 --> 00:22.477
a few light minutes
south of here.

00:22.564 --> 00:23.975
Oh, you still use
south in space?

00:24.066 --> 00:25.056
Whoa! Jesus, Jerry!

00:25.150 --> 00:26.640
What the hell
are you doing here?!

00:26.735 --> 00:27.816
What are you
talking about?

00:27.903 --> 00:29.485
We agreed a boy's father
should be present

00:29.571 --> 00:30.561
when he's learning
to drive.

00:30.656 --> 00:32.067
I guess I
remember that.

00:32.156 --> 00:33.898
Wow. And you've just been
back there this whole time?

00:33.992 --> 00:34.982
Amazing.

00:35.410 --> 00:37.071
Well, we don't have time
to take him to Earth, Morty.

00:37.162 --> 00:39.244
Head for 3924917.

00:39.331 --> 00:40.617
Cool!

00:40.707 --> 00:43.039
Looks like I'm coming along
for an adventure!

00:43.126 --> 00:44.412
Yep.

00:46.380 --> 00:47.461
This is where we're going?

00:47.548 --> 00:48.538
Nope.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.255
This is.

00:50.342 --> 00:51.924
You can park in
a handicap spot, Morty.

00:52.010 --> 00:53.341
Anything with
less than eight limbs

00:53.428 --> 00:55.715
is considered
disabled here.

00:59.768 --> 01:03.352
Well, look at this fella.
Aren't you handsome?

01:03.438 --> 01:04.519
Thank you.

01:04.605 --> 01:07.064
- I'm Jerry.
- Oh, I know you are.

01:07.150 --> 01:09.517
Did you come here
in a spaceship?

01:09.611 --> 01:12.069
I'm traveling with my son
and father-in-law.

01:12.155 --> 01:13.395
W-Wait.
Are they coming?

01:13.490 --> 01:14.605
Oh, they'll
be back soon.

01:14.700 --> 01:15.781
What?!

01:19.329 --> 01:20.569
I don't know
how this works!

01:20.664 --> 01:21.529
Help me!

01:21.623 --> 01:23.284
What the hell?!

01:23.375 --> 01:24.615
I know, right?

01:24.710 --> 01:26.121
Oh, what the hell?!

01:26.211 --> 01:27.451
I know, right?

01:27.546 --> 01:28.661
Jerryboree!?

01:28.755 --> 01:30.462
You created
a day care for my dad?

01:30.549 --> 01:32.460
Are you kidding?
I wish I had this idea.

01:32.551 --> 01:34.133
Well, I did
have this idea,

01:34.219 --> 01:36.426
but I wish I was the version
of me that owned it.

01:36.513 --> 01:38.129
That guy's rich.

01:38.223 --> 01:39.713
Don't forget to check
the reason for your drop-off.

01:39.808 --> 01:42.345
Trust me, Morty, I've heard
stories from other Ricks.

01:42.436 --> 01:45.019
Jerrys don't tend to last
five minutes off of earth.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.722
This is a totally unregistered
cross-temporal asteroid.

01:47.816 --> 01:50.399
Here, they can romp and
play with other Jerrys.

01:50.485 --> 01:51.520
He couldn't be safer.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.148
Hey, Morty,
hang on to this.

01:53.238 --> 01:54.649
That number's your dad.

01:54.740 --> 01:56.697
If you lose it, we're not gonna
be able to get him back.

01:56.950 --> 02:00.363
♪♪

02:28.774 --> 02:31.391
♪♪

02:37.574 --> 02:39.440
- Okay, wait here.
- I want to come with.

02:39.534 --> 02:41.150
Don't come with.
It's boring.

02:41.244 --> 02:42.530
It's --
it's business stuff.

02:42.621 --> 02:44.237
What kind of business
do you do in a garage?

02:44.331 --> 02:45.537
You know, this seems
a little shady.

02:45.624 --> 02:47.490
Right, yeah, like nothing
shady ever happened

02:47.584 --> 02:48.665
in a fully
furnished office?

02:48.752 --> 02:50.368
You ever hear
about Wall Street, Morty?

02:50.462 --> 02:51.577
Y-You know
what those guys do

02:51.672 --> 02:53.333
in -- in --
in their fancy boardrooms?

02:53.423 --> 02:55.334
They take their balls
and they dip them in cocaine

02:55.425 --> 02:56.665
and wipe them
all over each other.

02:56.760 --> 02:57.921
You know,
Grandpa goes around,

02:58.011 --> 02:59.797
and he does
his business in public,

02:59.888 --> 03:01.549
because Grandpa
isn't shady.

03:01.640 --> 03:02.971
Aw, crap.

03:03.058 --> 03:03.968
Hey, what's up?

03:04.059 --> 03:05.595
Hey, Rick!

03:05.686 --> 03:07.427
Here you go --
3000 flerbos.

03:07.521 --> 03:08.682
Do you have
the weapon?

03:08.772 --> 03:09.807
C-Can we please?

03:09.898 --> 03:11.559
This is my
grandson, Morty.

03:11.650 --> 03:13.311
Oh, hi, Morty.
I'm Krombopulos Michael.

03:13.402 --> 03:15.484
I'm an assassin.
I buy guns from your grandpa.

03:15.570 --> 03:16.731
Here. Go away.

03:16.822 --> 03:18.404
Ooh! Yeah,
this looks deadly.

03:18.490 --> 03:19.821
So, this shoots
antimatter?

03:19.908 --> 03:22.275
My target can't be killed
with regular matter.

03:22.369 --> 03:23.575
Nice to meet you, Morty.

03:23.662 --> 03:24.697
Listen, if you ever need
anybody murdered,

03:24.788 --> 03:26.495
please give me a call.

03:26.581 --> 03:27.537
- I'm very discreet.
- You're g-giving him a card?!

03:27.624 --> 03:28.785
I have no
code of ethics.

03:28.875 --> 03:30.582
I will kill anyone,
anywhere --

03:30.669 --> 03:33.331
Children, animals, old people --
doesn't matter.

03:33.422 --> 03:34.628
I just love killing.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.877
You sell weapons
to killers for money?

03:36.967 --> 03:39.299
You've got what
the intergalactic call

03:39.386 --> 03:40.797
a very planetary
mind-set, Morty.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.673
It's more complicated
out here.

03:42.764 --> 03:43.970
These are flerbos.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.923
Do you understand what
two humans can accomplish

03:46.017 --> 03:47.974
- with 3,000 of these?
- Uh, what?

03:48.061 --> 03:52.476
An entire afternoon
at Blips and Chitz!

03:52.566 --> 03:53.852
Oh, this place
is the best.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.603
It's got beer,
games, prizes,

03:55.694 --> 03:57.731
and you can never tell
what time it is.

03:57.821 --> 04:00.654
You sold a gun to a murderer
so you could play video games?!

04:00.741 --> 04:03.608
Yeah, sure, I mean, if you spend
all day shuffling words around,

04:03.702 --> 04:05.568
you can make anything
sound bad, Morty.

04:05.662 --> 04:07.448
Here, check this out.

04:08.665 --> 04:10.121
Aah!

04:10.208 --> 04:11.414
Roy, what's wrong?

04:11.501 --> 04:12.787
I had a nightmare.

04:12.878 --> 04:14.869
I was with an old man.

04:14.963 --> 04:16.749
He put a helmet on me.

04:16.839 --> 04:19.002
It's just a fever.
Get some sleep.

04:19.091 --> 04:21.083
I don't want you
missing school on Monday.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.012
I want you kids
to look around you today

04:25.098 --> 04:26.930
and think about
your future.

04:27.017 --> 04:29.759
Now is the time in your life
when anything is possible.

04:29.853 --> 04:30.888
<i>Spiraling perfectly!</i>

04:30.979 --> 04:32.515
<i>It's gonna be caught
by Roy Parsons!</i>

04:32.606 --> 04:33.641
<i>Roy Parsons
is at the 20!</i>

04:33.732 --> 04:34.767
<i>Now he's at the 10!</i>

04:34.858 --> 04:36.599
<i>Nothing can stop
Roy "The Rocket"!</i>

04:36.693 --> 04:38.604
<i>Touchdown!</i>

04:38.695 --> 04:40.732
I just think
it's time to get realistic.

04:40.822 --> 04:43.484
Have you talked to my father
about the Carpet Store?

04:43.575 --> 04:44.565
Roy?

04:47.913 --> 04:50.905
Had we caught it sooner --
Well, hindsight is 20/20, Roy.

04:50.999 --> 04:53.411
What's important
is that we move quickly.

04:54.711 --> 04:56.793
I'm not ready to die.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.041
You're not going to.

05:01.259 --> 05:03.842
Yeah!
Whoo! Yeah!

05:06.890 --> 05:08.597
Hey, thanks
for the carpet, Roy.

05:11.019 --> 05:13.807
Hey, Roy, you pulled
those Persian off-white shags

05:13.897 --> 05:15.183
for the clearance sale?

05:17.984 --> 05:19.941
Whoa. Sh--
shit!

05:20.028 --> 05:21.063
Oh!

05:22.155 --> 05:23.111
Whoa! What the hell?!

05:23.198 --> 05:24.654
W-W-Where am I?!

05:24.741 --> 05:26.152
- What in the hell?!
- 55 years. Not bad, Morty.

05:26.243 --> 05:27.825
You kind of wasted
your 30s, though,

05:27.911 --> 05:29.151
with that
whole bird-watching phase.

05:29.246 --> 05:30.202
W-Where's my wife?!

05:30.288 --> 05:31.574
Morty, you were just
playing a game.

05:31.665 --> 05:32.530
It's called "Roy."

05:32.624 --> 05:33.409
Snap out of it.
Come on.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.332
I'm Morty. You're Rick.

05:35.418 --> 05:37.204
Hey! You sold a gun
to a guy that kills people!

05:37.295 --> 05:38.785
Look at this --
you beat cancer,

05:38.880 --> 05:40.746
and then you went back
to work at the carpet store?

05:40.841 --> 05:41.751
Boo!

05:41.842 --> 05:43.173
D-Don't dodge
the issue, Rick!

05:43.260 --> 05:45.843
Selling a gun to a hit man is
the same as pulling the trigger!

05:45.929 --> 05:47.419
It's also the same
as doing nothing.

05:47.514 --> 05:49.300
If Krombopulos Michael
wants someone dead,

05:49.391 --> 05:51.257
there's not a lot
anyone can do to stop him.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.762
That's why he does it
for a living.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.561
Now excuse me. It's time
to thrash your "Roy" score.

05:55.647 --> 05:57.433
You know, you could stop this
killing from happening, Rick!

05:57.524 --> 05:59.265
You know, you did a bad thing
selling that gun,

05:59.359 --> 06:01.100
but you could undo it
if you wanted.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.275
Uh-huh, yeah,
that's the difference

06:02.362 --> 06:03.693
between you and me,
Morty.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.111
I never go back
to the carpet store.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.313
Holy shit!

06:06.408 --> 06:07.614
This guy's taking
Roy off the grid!

06:09.035 --> 06:10.992
This guy doesn't have a
social security number for Roy!

06:17.085 --> 06:18.120
Hi. I'm sorry.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.542
I think there was
a misunderstanding.

06:19.629 --> 06:21.540
I'm an adult and would like
to go home, please.

06:21.631 --> 06:24.874
Well, of course.
Right through that tube.

06:24.968 --> 06:26.458
Unbelievable.

06:28.346 --> 06:29.507
You're doing great.

06:29.598 --> 06:31.259
I know how to crawl
in a tube.

06:31.349 --> 06:33.681
Come on.

06:33.768 --> 06:34.724
Oh.

06:34.811 --> 06:35.926
This is harder
than it looks.

06:36.021 --> 06:37.011
Whoa!

06:38.648 --> 06:40.059
- Marco?
- Polo!

06:40.150 --> 06:41.390
Marco?

06:41.484 --> 06:42.895
Come find me.

06:42.986 --> 06:44.067
Marco?

06:44.154 --> 06:45.360
You guys
are enjoying this?

06:45.447 --> 06:47.404
Don't you feel
a little patronized?

06:47.490 --> 06:48.355
How so?

06:48.450 --> 06:49.940
- Jerry!
- Beth.

06:50.035 --> 06:51.742
Oh, come on.
This is ridiculous.

06:51.828 --> 06:54.069
I love you, Jerry.

06:54.164 --> 06:55.746
Aw, Beth.

06:55.832 --> 06:58.415
Who wants to come watch
"Midnight Run"

06:58.501 --> 07:00.959
with Director's
commentary on?

07:01.046 --> 07:02.457
- Yeah!
- Definitely.

07:02.547 --> 07:05.380
First one there gets to adjust
the picture setting!

07:05.467 --> 07:07.708
The factory tint setting is always too high!

07:07.802 --> 07:08.792
Out of my way.

07:08.887 --> 07:10.002
The tint setting
is always too high.

07:14.351 --> 07:17.013
♪♪

07:25.362 --> 07:27.023
Oh, boy.
Here I go killing again.

07:31.910 --> 07:32.945
Aah!

07:34.913 --> 07:36.074
Aah!

07:39.876 --> 07:41.366
Arh!

07:44.172 --> 07:45.287
Aah!

07:48.176 --> 07:49.917
Aah!

08:00.772 --> 08:04.561
<i>You have arrived
at Krombopulos Michael.</i>

08:04.651 --> 08:06.267
<i>Your destination is below.</i>

08:06.361 --> 08:08.693
We're all out
of off-white Persian.

08:09.614 --> 08:11.605
Oh, man!
W-W-What have I done?!

08:11.700 --> 08:13.316
- Drop the gun.
- You don't understand!

08:13.410 --> 08:14.650
This guy
was gonna kill someone!

08:14.744 --> 08:16.451
I guess
that makes two of us.

08:17.580 --> 08:18.570
Aah!

08:19.457 --> 08:20.618
What are you
doing, Morty?

08:20.709 --> 08:22.074
This is a Galactic
Federation outpost!

08:22.168 --> 08:24.375
Look, I don't have time
to tell you my entire backstory,

08:24.462 --> 08:26.044
but Grandpa and government
don't get along.

08:26.131 --> 08:27.713
He saved my life.

08:27.799 --> 08:29.289
- What?
- Huh?! Whoa!

08:29.384 --> 08:31.751
Are you
Krombopulos Michael's target?

08:31.845 --> 08:32.960
W-What's your name?

08:33.054 --> 08:34.965
My kind
has no use for names.

08:35.056 --> 08:38.594
I communicate through what
you call "Jessica's Feet" --

08:38.684 --> 08:40.346
No, "Telepathy."

08:40.437 --> 08:41.472
Oh, good job, Morty.

08:41.563 --> 08:43.019
Y-You killed
my best customer,

08:43.106 --> 08:44.938
but you saved
a mind-reading Fart.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.857
I like this name --
Fart.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.900
Morty, would you
kindly release me

08:48.987 --> 08:51.570

to the left of my cell?

08:51.656 --> 08:53.488
I am in great pain.

08:53.575 --> 08:55.532
Morty, don't do it.

08:55.618 --> 08:56.608
Morty...

08:57.704 --> 08:58.739
Morty, you idiot.

08:58.830 --> 09:00.412
Oh, crap.
Let's get you out of here!

09:00.498 --> 09:02.034
We can't get him out of here.
He's gaseous.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.957
He's not gonna make it
through a portal, Morty.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.876
Well, then, I guess we're all
getting in the car.

09:05.962 --> 09:07.293
- Right, uh --
- Fart.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.087
No! Just --
j-just get in the car!

09:09.174 --> 09:10.164
Morty, come on.

09:10.258 --> 09:11.589
I want to go back
to Blips and Chitz.

09:11.676 --> 09:12.711
I don't want to deal
with this.

09:12.802 --> 09:13.963
Rick, you've been clear
on the fact

09:14.054 --> 09:15.636
that you don't want to help,
so just go away.

09:15.722 --> 09:17.338
More are coming.

09:17.432 --> 09:19.298
Screw this. I'm out.

09:22.687 --> 09:25.179
Whoa!
Come on, come on!

09:25.273 --> 09:28.140
Get out of the vehicle made
of garbage or we will open fire!

09:29.277 --> 09:30.517
Um, um, um, um!

09:30.612 --> 09:31.898
Open fire!

09:31.988 --> 09:33.228
Aah!

09:42.040 --> 09:46.785
Stupid-ass, Fart-saving,
carpet-store motherfucker. Move!

09:46.878 --> 09:48.539
Wait, did you fuck
with my seat settings?

09:51.091 --> 09:52.923
More are coming.

09:54.427 --> 09:55.258
Rick!

09:55.345 --> 09:56.460
Yeah, yeah.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.637
Your geldon converter
is pretty dinged up.

10:06.731 --> 10:09.598
That's because my grandson
drives like a male Obravadian.

10:09.692 --> 10:12.184
Yeah, I said it -- some
stereotypes are based in fact.

10:12.278 --> 10:14.610
Actually, it's because
of years of neglect.

10:14.697 --> 10:17.029
You really need to respect
your gears, Rick.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.573
To you, they're just
wheels with teeth,

10:18.660 --> 10:20.776
but in my culture,
wars have been fought --

10:20.870 --> 10:22.577
So I've heard.
Just fix it.

10:22.664 --> 10:24.575
I don't think the Gromflamites
can track us now,

10:24.666 --> 10:26.623
but it looks like we're gonna
be here for a while.

10:26.709 --> 10:29.371
Or, you know, if you still have
that gun K. Michael dropped,

10:29.462 --> 10:31.248
we could finish the job
and go home.

10:31.339 --> 10:33.046
You do understand
I'm telepathic, right

10:33.133 --> 10:34.339
I'm being polite.

10:34.425 --> 10:36.211
Rick, we're taking him back
where he belongs.

10:36.302 --> 10:37.667
Oh, yeah? Where's that?

10:37.762 --> 10:39.252
Are you going on a quest
to find he who smelt it?

10:39.347 --> 10:41.714
I came here
accidentally through a wormhole

10:41.808 --> 10:44.891
located in what you call
"Get out of my head, Fart.

10:44.978 --> 10:47.185

10:47.272 --> 10:49.980
No, in what you call
the Promethean Nebula.

10:50.066 --> 10:53.149
Oh, great. Just a hop, skip,
and an 800-light-year jump.

10:53.236 --> 10:55.648
You know, you can leave
anytime you want, Rick.

10:55.738 --> 10:57.524
Whatever you want to do, you
little punk-ass little bitch.

10:57.615 --> 10:58.901

10:58.992 --> 11:01.734
You are not like other
carbon-based life-forms.

11:01.828 --> 11:04.195

life above your own.

is so valuable about you?

13:02.031 --> 13:04.398
I am no more valuable
than life itself.

13:04.492 --> 13:07.530
However, I am able to alter
the composition of atoms,

13:07.620 --> 13:08.826
like this.

13:09.914 --> 13:11.530
That was oxygen.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.535
I added
71 protons to it.

13:13.626 --> 13:16.539
Terrific.
The Fart that pooped gold.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.791

is too high.

13:34.439 --> 13:35.725
And like you always say,

13:35.815 --> 13:37.852

13:44.324 --> 13:47.032
It's
Revolio Clockberg Junior.

13:47.118 --> 13:49.655
I belong to an entire
species of gear people.

13:49.746 --> 13:50.986
Calling me "Gearhead"

13:51.080 --> 13:54.163

Yes, Morty.

Goodbye.

So, did you guys make out
a little bit?

20:28.769 --> 20:30.635
Is he gonna send you
a postcard?

20:30.730 --> 20:33.597
Man, that guy hit the lottery
when he crossed paths with you.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.482
Morty, I know I picked on
your core beliefs

20:36.569 --> 20:37.900
and decision making
a lot today,

20:37.987 --> 20:39.022
but I am glad
that you insisted

20:39.113 --> 20:40.729
on getting that Fart home.

20:40.823 --> 20:41.938
You know, at least
all the death and destruction

20:42.032 --> 20:43.818
wasn't for nothing,
you know?

20:44.535 --> 20:46.492
You miss
your Fart friend, huh?

20:46.579 --> 20:48.069
Well, I got a little surprise
for you, buddy.

20:48.164 --> 20:49.825
While you were gone,
I found a new wormhole

20:49.915 --> 20:51.781
with millions of beings just
like him on the other side,

20:51.876 --> 20:52.991
and they're all
coming to visit.

20:53.085 --> 20:54.621
What?!
Rick, no! You can't!

20:54.712 --> 20:55.873
Too late, Morty.
The hole's opening.

20:55.963 --> 20:57.328
No, Rick!
You don't understand.

20:59.049 --> 21:01.165
There's -- there's a lot more
where that came from, too.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.137
Hey, hey, bro,
how many people

21:07.224 --> 21:09.056
was your Morty responsible
for killing today?

21:09.143 --> 21:11.100
None. We chilled
at Blips and Chitz all day.

21:11.187 --> 21:12.518
Ain't that right,
homey?

21:12.605 --> 21:14.767
Darn right, bro!
"Roy" rules!

21:16.108 --> 21:17.189
Must be nice.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.608
Hey, Morty,
there's our Jerry.

21:19.695 --> 21:22.062
Mm! I missed you.
Hey, Rick.

21:22.156 --> 21:23.271
Glad you're safe, Jerry.

21:23.365 --> 21:25.982
- What do you say we go home?
- I'd like that.

21:26.076 --> 21:28.067
Hey, wait.
Uh, do you have 5126?

21:28.162 --> 21:30.654
Uh, I'm not sure.
Morty.

21:30.748 --> 21:32.614
Uh, that's
a Blips and Chitz ticket.

21:32.708 --> 21:34.494

- Way to go, Morty.

21:34.585 --> 21:35.746
Eh, whatever.

- Uh, w-wait. What?

21:37.838 --> 21:39.374
Come on, Jerry. All right.
Come on, Jerry.
