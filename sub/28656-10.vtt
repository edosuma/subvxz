00:00.250 --> 00:01.418
Previously on Elementary...

00:01.418 --> 00:05.047
I have saved hundreds of lives.

00:05.047 --> 00:07.883
What on earth makes you think
that we would ever consider

00:07.883 --> 00:10.260
joining your stable
of executioners?

00:10.260 --> 00:12.054
Next time I get
another 80/20 call,

00:12.054 --> 00:13.263
I'll send it
your way.

00:13.263 --> 00:14.890
It'll be your decision.

00:14.890 --> 00:17.309
Call it a trust-building
exercise.

00:17.309 --> 00:20.520
Two weeks ago, a man named
Parker Landis was driving home,

00:20.520 --> 00:22.147
and he was rear-ended.

00:22.147 --> 00:23.649
Then the guy shot him,
and then fled.

00:23.649 --> 00:25.442
Landis was plotting
a mass poisoning.

00:25.442 --> 00:27.027
But he was killed before
he could go through with it.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.071
Do you think Odin Reichenbach
is responsible?

00:29.071 --> 00:31.031
Joan Watson has
been poking around.

00:31.031 --> 00:34.034
She reached out to the Maricopa
County Sheriff's Office.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.203
Would you like me to...?
No.

00:38.121 --> 00:41.541
No, I think I'll
handle this one myself.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.590
WATSON:
You need to run faster.

00:51.635 --> 00:52.511
Faster.

00:52.511 --> 00:54.930
The angle is more
critical than the speed.

00:54.930 --> 00:55.847
Now!

00:59.184 --> 01:01.395
HOLMES:
Theory confirmed.

01:01.395 --> 01:04.648
You can inform Professor Soames
that the track star,

01:04.648 --> 01:06.817
Mr. Gilchrest, gained
access to her office,

01:06.817 --> 01:08.277
photographed the final exam,

01:08.277 --> 01:10.237
and then sold it
to other students on campus.

01:10.237 --> 01:11.571
I'll get right on it,
after I have my turn.

01:15.742 --> 01:17.202
(electronic thud)
What just happened?

01:23.208 --> 01:24.918
I'm locked out. You?

01:27.254 --> 01:29.089
(doorbell rings)

01:33.093 --> 01:35.137
Had a feeling it was you.

01:35.137 --> 01:37.681
Sorry about that.
But given your tendency

01:37.681 --> 01:39.725
to try and record
our private conversations...

01:39.725 --> 01:41.268
How'd you do it?
Signal jammer?

01:41.268 --> 01:42.519
Remote access device?

01:42.519 --> 01:44.229
Whatever it is,
I'm sure it's trademarked

01:44.229 --> 01:46.315
Odker technology...
I would trademark it

01:46.315 --> 01:49.651
if I wanted anyone to know
I had it.

01:49.651 --> 01:51.486
I'm here because I know
that Joan reached out

01:51.486 --> 01:54.281
to the Maricopa
Sheriff's Department

01:54.281 --> 01:55.991
about the death
of Parker Landis.

01:55.991 --> 01:58.118
If that's a look
of admonishment,

01:58.118 --> 02:00.078
look in the mirror.

02:00.078 --> 02:02.456
You tried to bring S.I.S.
into our little debate.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.166
Got friends there as well,
have you?

02:04.166 --> 02:07.419
You think I only try and stop
killers on American soil?

02:07.419 --> 02:09.296
S.I.S. won't be helping you.

02:09.296 --> 02:11.006
Neither will Mossad,
nor Interpol,

02:11.006 --> 02:13.050
nor any other
global law enforcement

02:13.050 --> 02:15.093
or intelligence agency
you might draw upon.

02:15.093 --> 02:17.971
Though many of them hold the
two of you in high esteem,

02:17.971 --> 02:21.308
they value my friendship
even more.

02:21.308 --> 02:23.185
You came here
to make more threats.

02:23.185 --> 02:26.646
Not at all.
I'm here to fulfill a promise.

02:26.646 --> 02:30.776
I brought a present.
Shall we open it together?

02:30.776 --> 02:33.195
"Wesley Conrad."

02:35.280 --> 02:38.700
So this is a dossier on someone
you've marked for execution.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.410
It's more than that.

02:40.410 --> 02:43.080
It's one last attempt to see
if we could all work together.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.414
When last we spoke,

02:44.414 --> 02:46.625
I promised that
when I next had a case

02:46.625 --> 02:48.585
I wasn't 100% certain of,

02:48.585 --> 02:50.670
I'd bring it to you
and Joan for review.

02:50.670 --> 02:52.005
I'm only, say,

02:52.005 --> 02:54.800
80% certain
that Wesley Conrad needs to go.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.010
Well, I hadn't considered that
a serious offer.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.637
You knew I was trying
to record you.

02:58.637 --> 03:01.306
I did.
But I meant every word.

03:01.306 --> 03:02.682
You said you were only 80% sure

03:02.682 --> 03:04.393
of this guy.
So, odds are,

03:04.393 --> 03:06.103
we'll prove you right.

03:06.103 --> 03:07.938
And then we'll be complicit
in what comes next.

03:07.938 --> 03:09.606
If you don't want
to look into this,

03:09.606 --> 03:12.234
I can take it to someone I know
sees things my way.

03:12.234 --> 03:15.028
Problem solved.
Mr. Conrad doesn't hurt anyone,

03:15.028 --> 03:16.947
and I'll know that you and I

03:16.947 --> 03:19.116
will never be friends.

03:19.116 --> 03:20.492
But I think
you'll say yes.

03:20.492 --> 03:22.285
It's too good an opportunity
to prove me wrong.

03:22.285 --> 03:24.913
Show me the faults
in my methods.

03:24.913 --> 03:27.416
What makes you so sure
this guy is so dangerous?

03:27.416 --> 03:31.753
Mr. Conrad has a podcast
on historical mysteries.

03:31.753 --> 03:35.382
He believes that a British
filmmaker named Bertram Iwan

03:35.382 --> 03:38.802
has plagiarized one of his shows
and used it as the basis

03:38.802 --> 03:42.556
for his latest documentary,
The Devil's Foot.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.641
On social media,

03:44.641 --> 03:46.935
Mr. Conrad has made it clear
he is furious.

03:46.935 --> 03:49.813
Mr. Iwan, meanwhile,
is set to appear in Manhattan

03:49.813 --> 03:52.732
in three days' time
for a screening

03:52.732 --> 03:55.735
of The Devil's Foot,
Q&A to follow.

03:55.735 --> 03:58.196
So naturally you think
he's going to shoot up a cinema?

03:58.196 --> 04:02.284
What I think's irrelevant.
His life is in your hands now.

04:02.284 --> 04:04.035
Do your own research.

04:04.035 --> 04:07.038
And then you tell me...

04:07.038 --> 04:08.665
is it better
to eliminate Conrad

04:08.665 --> 04:11.710
or risk him killing
dozens of people?

04:14.880 --> 04:18.717
GUIDE: Murder. That's what
we're all here for, right?

04:18.717 --> 04:21.511
Well, over the next two hours,
we'll walk to the sites

04:21.511 --> 04:24.598
of some of New York City's
most infamous murders.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.683
We'll show you the Big
Apple's rotten core,

04:26.683 --> 04:30.103
and maybe we'll find some
surprises along the way.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.439
Now stay together. We
don't want to lose anyone.

04:32.439 --> 04:33.690
Again.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.275
(laughter)

04:35.275 --> 04:36.943
Now for our first stop.

04:36.943 --> 04:38.737
18 years ago,

04:38.737 --> 04:41.531
a beautiful Broadway star
named Autumn Cleary

04:41.531 --> 04:45.535
was found strangled
in this very courtyard.

04:45.535 --> 04:47.704
The crime was never solved,
but the suspects

04:47.704 --> 04:49.998
were a who's-who
of the theater world.

04:49.998 --> 04:51.791
So let me tell you her story.

04:51.791 --> 04:54.795
And who knows, maybe one of you
will solve her murder.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.339
(laughter)

04:57.339 --> 04:59.966
It was August 20, 2001.

04:59.966 --> 05:01.843
There was an unusual chill
in the air

05:01.843 --> 05:02.886
the night that Autumn died.

05:05.555 --> 05:07.766
(chuckling):
Sorry, excuse me for a second.

05:07.766 --> 05:10.977
Looks like we have
some stragglers.

05:10.977 --> 05:11.978
Excuse me?

05:11.978 --> 05:15.732
What are you doing?

05:15.732 --> 05:17.192
Taking a few pictures
with "Autumn" here.

05:17.192 --> 05:18.777
What?

05:18.777 --> 05:20.320
Your partner.
She was gonna jump out

05:20.320 --> 05:21.321
and scare us
or something, right?

05:22.614 --> 05:23.490
You said there'd be surprises.

05:25.367 --> 05:27.452
I've never seen
that person before.

05:27.452 --> 05:28.995
She's not a part of the tour.

05:28.995 --> 05:30.497
Yeah, right.
I'm serious.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.084
All right. Enough.
You're scaring my girl.

05:35.710 --> 05:37.462
Look up and show her
it's all an act.

05:39.089 --> 05:40.715
Hey. I'm talking to you.

05:40.715 --> 05:42.217
(woman screams)

05:49.683 --> 05:52.811
According to that, Wesley
Conrad's plagiarized podcast

05:52.811 --> 05:54.896
covered an obscure bit
of local history

05:54.896 --> 05:57.774
from Cornwall, England.

05:57.774 --> 06:00.402
In 1910, whilst playing cards,

06:00.402 --> 06:03.321
four siblings saw
a strange "beast" at the window.

06:03.321 --> 06:05.615
One of the siblings,
a man named Mortimer Tregannis,

06:05.615 --> 06:06.866
went to investigate,

06:06.866 --> 06:08.785
found nothing,
and then went home.

06:08.785 --> 06:11.621
After which,
some "unknown force"

06:11.621 --> 06:15.166
drove two of his brothers mad
and killed his sister.

06:15.166 --> 06:16.585
Locals blamed the Devil himself.

06:16.585 --> 06:18.587
In his podcast,

06:18.587 --> 06:22.173
Conrad proposed a new theory
to explain events.

06:22.173 --> 06:24.217
He believed there was no beast.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.845
Tregannis made it up. Why?

06:26.845 --> 06:29.097
Because, before he left
the card game that night,

06:29.097 --> 06:31.808
he threw the root of a rare,
poisonous plant

06:31.808 --> 06:33.893
into the fireplace,
filling the room with toxins

06:33.893 --> 06:36.062
in an attempt
to kill his siblings

06:36.062 --> 06:37.897
and claim the family fortune.

06:37.897 --> 06:41.651
So, Iwan's documentary is
based on the same theory.

06:41.651 --> 06:44.446
Conrad sued Iwan.

06:44.446 --> 06:47.741
But his lawsuit
is floundering.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.909
Well, it looks like he's
threatened Iwan online

06:49.909 --> 06:51.870
dozens of times.

06:51.870 --> 06:53.288
"You stole my life's work.

06:53.288 --> 06:55.498
You deserve what's
coming to you."

06:55.498 --> 06:58.668
He also did a search for the
layout of the theater where Iwan

06:58.668 --> 07:01.630
is supposed to have his
screening for his documentary.

07:01.630 --> 07:04.174
He also researched
a variety of firearms.

07:04.174 --> 07:05.925
There's no evidence
he actually bought one.

07:05.925 --> 07:07.927
Perhaps that's why Odin
is only 80% sure

07:07.927 --> 07:10.180
there's going to be
a mass shooting in the offing.

07:10.180 --> 07:12.766
Wesley Conrad made a
very big cash withdrawal

07:12.766 --> 07:14.100
from his bank a
few weeks ago.

07:15.769 --> 07:18.813
Right before he took
a trip to Vermont.

07:18.813 --> 07:22.525
A state notorious
for its lax gun laws.

07:22.525 --> 07:25.111
I'm afraid that so far
I'm inclined to agree with Odin.

07:26.404 --> 07:28.365
Wesley Conrad bears
looking into.

07:28.365 --> 07:30.950
(phone vibrates)

07:32.535 --> 07:34.996
Oh, it's Marcus. He wants
to see us at the morgue.

07:34.996 --> 07:36.414
Should I tell him no?

07:36.414 --> 07:38.208
No.

07:38.208 --> 07:39.793
Bertram Iwan
is not due in New York

07:39.793 --> 07:41.461
for almost another three days.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.005
I'm already formulating a plan.
In the meantime,

07:44.005 --> 07:46.841
actual murders must not wait.

07:49.344 --> 07:51.471
Right now, she's a Jane Doe.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.181
We know she was zapped
with a stun gun.

07:53.181 --> 07:56.017
You can see the marks on
her shoulder right there.

07:56.017 --> 07:58.061
After that, she was smothered,
probably with a pillow.

07:58.061 --> 07:59.396
Not the sort of thing
you expect to find

07:59.396 --> 08:00.939
lying around in a courtyard.

08:00.939 --> 08:03.483
She was killed someplace
else, then dumped there.

08:03.483 --> 08:06.277
Just like Autumn
Cleary 18 years ago.

08:06.277 --> 08:07.946
You think these cases
are connected.

08:07.946 --> 08:10.281
Autumn Cleary was strangled,
not smothered.

08:10.281 --> 08:12.117
It's still
technically asphyxiation.

08:12.117 --> 08:14.035
Both victims were
attractive young women,

08:14.035 --> 08:15.662
both were killed
someplace else

08:15.662 --> 08:17.163
and then left in
that courtyard.

08:17.163 --> 08:19.082
Could be the same killer.
Or a copycat.

08:19.082 --> 08:20.875
Or it could just be
a coincidence.

08:20.875 --> 08:21.918
HOLMES:
It's no coincidence.

08:21.918 --> 08:24.879
Look at this.

08:24.879 --> 08:26.339
The carpet fibers
found on Jane Doe.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.924
If memory serves,
there were green carpet fibers

08:27.924 --> 08:30.552
found on Autumn Cleary's
body in 2001.

08:30.552 --> 08:32.971
You're thinking they were killed
in the same place?

08:32.971 --> 08:34.556
WATSON: If they were,
it stands to reason

08:34.556 --> 08:36.725
they were killed
by the same person.

08:36.725 --> 08:38.560
HOLMES: Jane Doe's murder
may be fresher,

08:38.560 --> 08:40.562
but her anonymity
is a problem.

08:40.562 --> 08:42.147
We can't identify the person
who wanted her dead

08:42.147 --> 08:44.107
until we can identify her.

08:44.107 --> 08:45.984
Luckily, investigators
have been poring over

08:45.984 --> 08:48.194
Autumn Cleary's case for years.

08:48.194 --> 08:49.946
I think there's even
a list of suspects.

08:49.946 --> 08:52.115
So we look at them and see

08:52.115 --> 08:53.992
if we can connect anyone
to Jane Doe.

08:53.992 --> 08:56.578
Any luck, we might be able
to close both cases at once.

08:59.164 --> 09:01.666
That's impressive.

09:01.666 --> 09:04.002
Well, it's like you said,
there's 18 years of research

09:04.002 --> 09:05.670
into Autumn Cleary's murder.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.464
And not just by the NYPD.

09:07.464 --> 09:09.674
True crime writers,
investigative journalists.

09:09.674 --> 09:11.885
There was even a 48 Hours.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.471
How about you? Did you find
what you were looking for?

09:14.471 --> 09:16.598
There was indeed a gun show
in Vermont on the weekend

09:16.598 --> 09:18.057
of Wesley Conrad's visit.

09:18.057 --> 09:20.226
So he could've bought a gun.

09:20.226 --> 09:22.437
Given Vermont's gun laws, he
could've bought an arsenal.

09:22.437 --> 09:24.939
I think we have to
assume he has the means

09:24.939 --> 09:26.232
to carry out an attack.

09:26.232 --> 09:28.276
So what now?

09:28.276 --> 09:29.486
According to his
teaching schedule,

09:29.486 --> 09:31.446
he's in the middle of
a lecture right now.

09:31.446 --> 09:32.739
I plan to visit
him presently.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.240
So, are these the people

09:34.240 --> 09:36.951
most likely to have killed
Autumn Cleary in 2001?

09:38.620 --> 09:40.455
Dustin Turco was
an obsessed fan.

09:40.455 --> 09:41.664
She got a
restraining order

09:41.664 --> 09:43.208
against him a month
before she was killed.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.209
Why the cross?

09:44.209 --> 09:45.835
Well, he was five-one

09:45.835 --> 09:47.337
and had brittle
bone disease.

09:47.337 --> 09:49.923
I don't think he had the size or
the strength to strangle anyone.

09:49.923 --> 09:52.300
Her ex-boyfriend from high
school-- he came to New York

09:52.300 --> 09:55.470
to win her back.
She wasn't interested.

09:55.470 --> 09:59.349
He was calling her
and e-mailing after she died.

09:59.349 --> 10:01.518
It certainly appears that
he thought she was still alive.

10:01.518 --> 10:04.020
The director of the show
she was in--

10:04.020 --> 10:05.605
they fought constantly.

10:05.605 --> 10:08.107
He threatened to kill her once,
but he's got a rock-solid alibi.

10:08.107 --> 10:10.652
So that leaves us
with her suspected lover

10:10.652 --> 10:11.319
and her understudy.

10:15.365 --> 10:19.035
It's the lover.
Hampton Vanderwey.

10:19.035 --> 10:20.328
Note the cuff links.

10:20.328 --> 10:22.163
Very distinctive.

10:22.163 --> 10:23.873
Judging from the fact
that he's wearing them

10:23.873 --> 10:24.999
in almost every
photograph here,

10:24.999 --> 10:27.085
something of an affectation.

10:27.085 --> 10:29.963
They're diamond shaped.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.257
And there were scrape marks
on the side of Autumn's neck.

10:32.257 --> 10:34.300
If he had her in a choke hold...

10:34.300 --> 10:36.511
It would've left marks
of a similar size and shape

10:36.511 --> 10:38.596
to his favorite accessory.

10:38.596 --> 10:41.724
Well, I have a potential
mass murderer to interview.

10:41.724 --> 10:43.226
But it looks like
you've found your man.

10:51.234 --> 10:53.987
Wesley Conrad.
Might I have a word?

10:53.987 --> 10:55.405
You're English.

10:55.405 --> 10:56.739
I am.

10:56.739 --> 10:58.157
You work for Bertram Iwan?

10:58.157 --> 11:00.201
No. But he is the reason
I'd like to talk to you.

11:00.201 --> 11:02.412
I think I might be able
to help you with the lawsuit

11:02.412 --> 11:03.288
you filed against him.

11:06.291 --> 11:09.419
You're a private investigator?

11:09.419 --> 11:11.713
I prefer "consulting detective,"
but yes.

11:11.713 --> 11:13.631
I was very impressed
with your work

11:13.631 --> 11:15.592
on the Devil's Foot
conundrum.

11:15.592 --> 11:17.302
Your theory that Mortimer
Tregannis poisoned

11:17.302 --> 11:19.137
his siblings with a toxic plant

11:19.137 --> 11:21.764
stolen from his sister's fiancé
was very persuasive.

11:21.764 --> 11:25.143
So persuasive, Iwan stole it
to make his documentary.

11:25.143 --> 11:26.686
Some big studio already
bought the rights

11:26.686 --> 11:28.521
so they can turn
it into a feature.

11:28.521 --> 11:31.357
As if plagiarizing me
weren't bad enough,

11:31.357 --> 11:32.859
now he's gonna
make millions.

11:32.859 --> 11:35.486
A gross injustice.

11:35.486 --> 11:37.739
And that's precisely
why I wanted to see you.

11:37.739 --> 11:39.741
You said you wanted
to help with my lawsuit.

11:39.741 --> 11:42.035
I-I don't think
there's anything left to do.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.913
I hired lawyers in the U.S.
and the U.K.

11:44.913 --> 11:47.165
I sued in both places,
filed restraining orders.

11:47.165 --> 11:48.958
I had to move back in
with my parents

11:48.958 --> 11:50.919
so I could pay for it all.

11:50.919 --> 11:52.712
Nothing worked.

11:52.712 --> 11:55.882
Now, I-I can't afford
to chase it anymore.

11:55.882 --> 11:57.675
Well, justice can be slippery.

11:57.675 --> 11:59.719
Why don't you let me
help you grasp it?

11:59.719 --> 12:01.346
This is a law firm
I've done

12:01.346 --> 12:03.056
plenty of work with
over the years.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.266
They've got offices in London,
New York, Hong Kong.

12:05.266 --> 12:09.187
I persuaded them to take on your
case on a commission-only basis.

12:09.187 --> 12:11.773
You'd pay nothing until you win.

12:11.773 --> 12:13.483
If you're interested.

12:15.818 --> 12:19.614
ERIKA: Hampton's father
gave him those cuff links.

12:19.614 --> 12:21.449
He was a son of a bitch, too.

12:23.701 --> 12:25.244
You think Hampton murdered
Autumn Cleary,

12:25.244 --> 12:27.872
and because you think
he murdered Autumn Cleary,

12:27.872 --> 12:31.960
you also think he murdered
the woman you found last night?

12:31.960 --> 12:34.212
(laughs):
There's just one problem.

12:34.212 --> 12:36.589
Your husband's been dead
for ten years. We know.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.633
We found out right before
we called you.

12:38.633 --> 12:41.886
If you knew he was dead,
why call at all?

12:41.886 --> 12:43.888
Because if we're right about him
killing Autumn Cleary,

12:43.888 --> 12:46.057
it's possible
he didn't act alone.

12:46.057 --> 12:47.642
And maybe the person
that helped him

12:47.642 --> 12:49.602
committed the murder last night.

12:49.602 --> 12:52.271
We were hoping
that you could point us

12:52.271 --> 12:53.856
in someone's direction.

12:57.068 --> 12:58.903
First things first.

12:58.903 --> 13:02.281
My husband absolutely murdered
Autumn Cleary.

13:02.281 --> 13:04.492
He confessed to you
at some point?

13:04.492 --> 13:06.285
No.

13:06.285 --> 13:08.329
But I knew he was seeing her.

13:08.329 --> 13:09.580
And I knew,

13:09.580 --> 13:11.290
better than anyone,

13:11.290 --> 13:14.168
that he was a violent man.

13:14.168 --> 13:16.504
He'd been abusing me for years.

13:16.504 --> 13:18.965
We're sorry to hear that.

13:18.965 --> 13:23.302
You know, he owned properties
all around the city, right?

13:23.302 --> 13:24.721
His name is still
on the buildings.

13:24.721 --> 13:26.305
"Vanderwey this,
Vanderwey that."

13:26.305 --> 13:29.183
Turns out,
there was one building

13:29.183 --> 13:31.769
he didn't put his name on.

13:31.769 --> 13:33.104
I only found out
about it

13:33.104 --> 13:34.939
after he died.

13:34.939 --> 13:36.524
He kept an apartment there.

13:36.524 --> 13:40.153
A place to stash his mistresses.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.363
The building bordered
the courtyard

13:42.363 --> 13:46.367
where Autumn Cleary's body
was found.

13:46.367 --> 13:49.328
Both bodies, now.

13:49.328 --> 13:51.330
If you thought your husband
killed Autumn,

13:51.330 --> 13:53.332
why didn't you say anything
to the police?

13:53.332 --> 13:55.585
He was dead.

13:55.585 --> 13:59.130
I-I didn't want my children
growing up thinking

13:59.130 --> 14:01.382
their father was a murderer.

14:01.382 --> 14:04.427
So I-I kept it to myself.

14:04.427 --> 14:07.013
I got rid of the building
as soon as I could.

14:07.013 --> 14:09.390
The children are grown now.
If the truth finally

14:09.390 --> 14:12.268
has to come out, then so be it.

14:12.268 --> 14:14.437
I'm just sorry it won't help

14:14.437 --> 14:18.691
find the person who murdered
that poor woman last night.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.235
Actually, I'm not so sure
it won't.

14:21.235 --> 14:23.279
Before you sold the building,
did you ever go there?

14:23.279 --> 14:25.490
Of course.

14:25.490 --> 14:28.701
There were inspections,
tenant association meetings.

14:28.701 --> 14:29.952
Did you ever go
inside the apartment

14:29.952 --> 14:31.245
that your husband kept?

14:31.245 --> 14:34.165
I did.

14:34.165 --> 14:36.918
I couldn't help myself.

14:36.918 --> 14:39.128
Morbid curiosity, I guess.

14:39.128 --> 14:41.380
And do you happen
to remember

14:41.380 --> 14:43.883
if there was
any green carpeting inside?

14:43.883 --> 14:45.885
Wall-to-wall. Why?

14:45.885 --> 14:48.096
BELL: Because carpet
fibers that color

14:48.096 --> 14:50.932
were found on Autumn's body
and the body of our Jane Doe.

14:50.932 --> 14:54.519
We're gonna want the address
of that building.

14:54.519 --> 14:56.979
BELL: Okay, so Mrs. Vanderwey
said the apartment

14:56.979 --> 14:59.065
we're looking for is
the last one on the right.

14:59.065 --> 15:01.359
(phone ringing)

15:01.359 --> 15:03.444
Hey. You almost here?

15:03.444 --> 15:06.030
I am here,
in a manner of speaking.

15:06.030 --> 15:07.907
I'm in the courtyard
where Autumn Cleary

15:07.907 --> 15:09.951
and Jane Doe were found.
I wanted to see it for myself.

15:09.951 --> 15:11.994
And?

15:11.994 --> 15:13.996
Well, it's strange.
While the building you're in

15:13.996 --> 15:16.833
does border this area,
there's no direct access.

15:16.833 --> 15:19.627
To get here, both Jane Doe's
killer and Hampton Vanderwey

15:19.627 --> 15:21.838
would've had to carry
their victims almost a block.

15:21.838 --> 15:23.798
Are you sure?

15:23.798 --> 15:25.591
Yeah, I'm positive.
So the question is,

15:25.591 --> 15:27.802
why would not one
but two killers

15:27.802 --> 15:29.554
want to take such a risk?

15:29.554 --> 15:31.013
All right, I-I got to go.

15:31.013 --> 15:33.057
Meet us upstairs
when you're done.

15:33.057 --> 15:34.350
(knocking on door)

15:34.350 --> 15:35.893
DURAH:
Uh, who is it?

15:35.893 --> 15:38.354
Police, ma'am.
We'd like to talk to you.

15:41.858 --> 15:43.401
Yes?

15:43.401 --> 15:44.443
I'm Detective Bell,

15:44.443 --> 15:46.696
this is my colleague
Joan Watson.

15:46.696 --> 15:48.072
Did you hear about the body
that was found outside

15:48.072 --> 15:49.240
the building last night?

15:49.240 --> 15:51.742
Body? No. Someone died?

15:51.742 --> 15:53.119
Actually, someone
was killed.

15:53.119 --> 15:55.454
We have reason to believe
that they may have been

15:55.454 --> 15:57.373
inside your apartment
last night.

15:59.041 --> 16:01.377
You know her.

16:01.377 --> 16:03.921
Kamile. She'd been staying here.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.965
I didn't really know her.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.341
She was staying
in your apartment,

16:07.341 --> 16:08.926
and you didn't know her?

16:08.926 --> 16:10.595
This isn't
my apartment.

16:10.595 --> 16:13.389
And there are many of us here.
20, at least.

16:13.389 --> 16:16.184
It's hard to keep
track of one another.

16:16.184 --> 16:17.476
Come. I'll show you.

16:20.730 --> 16:22.815
BELL:
What is this place?

16:22.815 --> 16:25.193
It's a model apartment.

16:25.193 --> 16:27.361
It's where models
come and live

16:27.361 --> 16:29.322
when they come
to New York to work.

16:29.322 --> 16:30.281
Is that right?

16:30.281 --> 16:32.325
Kamile arrived last week.

16:32.325 --> 16:35.620
She was doing a show for
a designer friend, Octavian.

16:35.620 --> 16:38.414
We're gonna need his contact
details, if you have them.

16:38.414 --> 16:40.124
The hell did you come from?
I thought you were
in the courtyard.

16:40.124 --> 16:41.292
HOLMES:
I was.

16:41.292 --> 16:43.669
And then I was here.

16:43.669 --> 16:45.046
Probably easier
to show you than explain.

16:58.768 --> 17:01.103
Is that an elevator?

17:01.103 --> 17:03.439
I found a secret entrance
in the courtyard.

17:03.439 --> 17:05.733
That led to a corridor,
which led to this.

17:05.733 --> 17:08.694
I wager Hampton Vanderwey
had it built so he could meet

17:08.694 --> 17:10.780
his mistresses up here
without being seen.

17:10.780 --> 17:12.365
It also has to be the way
he got Autumn's body

17:12.365 --> 17:13.908
into the courtyard in 2001.

17:13.908 --> 17:16.786
And how the person
who killed Kamile

17:16.786 --> 17:18.496
got her body out
of here last night.

17:18.496 --> 17:20.373
Well, that's two
mysteries solved.

17:20.373 --> 17:23.542
I'd say the next one was:
who knew it was still here?

17:28.798 --> 17:30.549
Fibers taken from the carpet
were consistent

17:30.549 --> 17:33.761
with the ones found on Autumn
Cleary and our former Jane Doe.

17:33.761 --> 17:36.722
Her name is Kamile Volodka.

17:36.722 --> 17:39.225
Born in Lithuania,
she came here when she was 15.

17:39.225 --> 17:41.519
She was sponsored
by her sister, Regina,

17:41.519 --> 17:43.187
who's also a model.

17:43.187 --> 17:44.814
No other family in the U.S.

17:44.814 --> 17:46.190
We've been trying to track
Regina down,

17:46.190 --> 17:48.192
but so far,
we're not having much luck.

17:48.192 --> 17:50.152
What about the other women
staying at the apartment?

17:50.152 --> 17:52.280
We like any of them
for what happened to Kamile?

17:52.280 --> 17:53.823
Sherlock and I are about
to start interviews,

17:53.823 --> 17:55.783
but, for what it's worth,

17:55.783 --> 17:57.076
they all seemed
pretty surprised

17:57.076 --> 17:58.577
when they saw the hidden
elevator car.

17:58.577 --> 18:00.538
I don't think any of them
knew it was there.

18:00.538 --> 18:03.082
I'm more interested in speaking
to the building's owner.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.793
Right. You figure whoever bought
the place from Erika Vanderwey

18:05.793 --> 18:07.503
found out about it?

18:07.503 --> 18:09.505
And they used it
to move Kamile's body?

18:09.505 --> 18:11.549
Problem is, the building's held
by a shell company.

18:11.549 --> 18:13.509
Joan's at
the City Register's Office,

18:13.509 --> 18:15.511
trying to find out more,
but I don't think the owner

18:15.511 --> 18:17.722
wanted it to be easy for people
to track him down.

18:17.722 --> 18:19.515
That makes sense, right?

18:19.515 --> 18:23.019
The city considers model
apartments unlicensed hotels.

18:23.019 --> 18:24.854
Inspectors have
been cracking down.

18:24.854 --> 18:27.148
They should. The models' agents
book the apartments

18:27.148 --> 18:29.942
as short-term housing
while they're in town for work,

18:29.942 --> 18:32.361
and then deduct the rent
from their paychecks.

18:32.361 --> 18:33.904
Up-and-coming models
don't make that much,

18:33.904 --> 18:35.865
so the rent eats up
a lot of their pay.

18:35.865 --> 18:37.700
Maybe Kamile had had enough.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.535
She found out who
owned the building

18:39.535 --> 18:41.871
and threatened to expose them
for what they were doing.

18:41.871 --> 18:43.664
Got herself killed
for the trouble.

18:43.664 --> 18:45.708
If that's the case,

18:45.708 --> 18:48.085
maybe she told one of the girls
what she was doing.

18:48.085 --> 18:51.005
It's possible.
But?

18:51.005 --> 18:52.089
The models may all
live together,

18:52.089 --> 18:53.591
but as far as we can tell,

18:53.591 --> 18:55.343
they barely know each other.
I'm not sure

18:55.343 --> 18:58.054
any of them even knew
Kamile was missing.

19:03.225 --> 19:06.979
You have to understand, girls
move in and out of apartments

19:06.979 --> 19:08.689
like ours every day,

19:08.689 --> 19:10.691
and no one spends
much time in them.

19:10.691 --> 19:13.486
Most of us are either working
or out on the town.

19:13.486 --> 19:16.113
The apartment was quite
well-populated when we arrived.

19:16.113 --> 19:19.450
A group of us had a break
between a show and a reception.

19:19.450 --> 19:21.452
We decided to go home
to change outfits,

19:21.452 --> 19:23.371
make an entrance together.

19:23.371 --> 19:25.915
The M.E. thinks Kamile was
strangled the day before

19:25.915 --> 19:28.459
yesterday, between 3:00 and 6:00
in the afternoon.

19:28.459 --> 19:31.462
Some of the other models told us
you were all at a show?

19:31.462 --> 19:35.132
Kamile skipped it.
She didn't say why.

19:35.132 --> 19:37.635
We understand the two of you
weren't particularly close,

19:37.635 --> 19:40.471
but had you noticed any unsavory
characters in her life?

19:40.471 --> 19:45.059
We're models. Almost everyone
we meet is unsavory.

19:45.059 --> 19:48.270
I did overhear her talking
on the phone a few days ago.

19:48.270 --> 19:50.731
It sounded like someone was
asking her for money.

19:50.731 --> 19:52.650
She said
something like,

19:52.650 --> 19:54.402
"I just gave you $1,000.

19:54.402 --> 19:56.028
Why do you need more so soon?"

19:56.028 --> 19:57.696
There was a back-and-forth,

19:57.696 --> 20:00.074
then Kamile agreed to send
whoever it was

20:00.074 --> 20:02.159
$500.

20:02.159 --> 20:06.664
Hard to imagine $500
was worth killing over.

20:06.664 --> 20:10.918
In my country,
people kill for much less.

20:10.918 --> 20:12.920
I'm sorry. That's all I know.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.675
Augustina? No last name,

20:17.675 --> 20:19.427
just Augustina, you're next.

20:19.427 --> 20:20.469
LAWYER:
Detective Bell?

20:20.469 --> 20:21.846
Yeah?

20:21.846 --> 20:23.055
If these interviews
are about the Jane Doe

20:23.055 --> 20:25.099
who was found two nights ago,

20:25.099 --> 20:26.934
you might want to talk
to my client first.

20:26.934 --> 20:28.269
Which one is she?

20:28.269 --> 20:31.147
Not she. He.

20:31.147 --> 20:33.566
His name is Peyton Trask.

20:33.566 --> 20:36.068
He owns the building
where the victim was staying.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.361
We understand
you've been looking for him.

20:37.361 --> 20:38.904
First off,

20:38.904 --> 20:40.448
we'd like to set
the record straight.

20:40.448 --> 20:43.451
Mr. Trask is a
hedge fund manager

20:43.451 --> 20:45.870
who bought that building
as an investment.

20:45.870 --> 20:47.663
He hardly ever
goes there.

20:47.663 --> 20:48.956
He never meets his residents.

20:48.956 --> 20:50.249
He definitely

20:50.249 --> 20:52.960
never interacted
with Ms. Volodka.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.670
So he had no motive to kill her.

20:54.670 --> 20:57.173
If Mr. Trask wants to set
anything straight,

20:57.173 --> 20:59.884
he's gonna have
to actually talk.

20:59.884 --> 21:01.635
HOLMES: You might think
it's in your best interest

21:01.635 --> 21:03.262
to stay silent,
Mr. Trask,

21:03.262 --> 21:05.264
but your anxiety speaks volumes.

21:05.264 --> 21:06.974
You're clearly
holding something back.

21:06.974 --> 21:09.351
I-I didn't kill her, okay?
Peyton.

21:09.351 --> 21:11.395
But I did move the body.

21:11.395 --> 21:12.897
I went to check
on the apartment

21:12.897 --> 21:15.024
around 9:00, when I thought
it would be empty.

21:15.024 --> 21:16.609
That's when
I found her.

21:16.609 --> 21:18.402
She was already dead.

21:18.402 --> 21:21.030
What do you mean,
"check on the apartment"?

21:21.030 --> 21:22.573
HOLMES: He means
he was on the hunt

21:22.573 --> 21:24.909
for lingerie.
What?

21:24.909 --> 21:26.243
Several of the models

21:26.243 --> 21:28.245
in the apartment reported
their undergarments missing.

21:28.245 --> 21:30.080
From the way you sat down,
it's clear you're wearing

21:30.080 --> 21:31.373
a thong under
your trousers.

21:31.373 --> 21:32.666
One of theirs, no?

21:32.666 --> 21:34.543
You have an
underwear fetish?

21:36.629 --> 21:39.548
Maybe Kamile Volodka walked in
on your little panty raid.

21:39.548 --> 21:41.383
You killed her so no one else
would find out.

21:41.383 --> 21:44.428
No. You've got it
all wrong.

21:44.428 --> 21:46.931
Not the... underwear part.

21:46.931 --> 21:48.974
Th-The part where
I'm some sort of killer.

21:48.974 --> 21:50.684
I took the elevator

21:50.684 --> 21:53.312
up to the apartment,
and she was there, already dead.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.314
There wasn't a mark on her,
so I figured she OD'd.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.899
I know I should've
called the police,

21:56.899 --> 21:59.026
but I didn't want housing
inspectors crawling up my butt,

21:59.026 --> 22:00.361
so I moved her outside.

22:00.361 --> 22:03.656
I assume you have
a time of death by now.

22:03.656 --> 22:06.825
Let's just say we'd be curious
to know where Mr. Trask was

22:06.825 --> 22:10.496
two days ago between the hours
of 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m.

22:10.496 --> 22:13.207
I was at my firm
until a little after 7:00.

22:13.207 --> 22:16.752
Dozens of people can
place me there, I swear.

22:16.752 --> 22:18.796
I made a mistake, okay?

22:18.796 --> 22:22.258
A lot of mistakes, but I-I swear
I didn't hurt that girl.

22:24.552 --> 22:26.929
If it helps,
I can give you her phone.

22:26.929 --> 22:28.639
You have her phone?

22:28.639 --> 22:30.266
(stammers) It was
in her pocket.

22:30.266 --> 22:33.185
I took it out and took it home
and put it in my trash.

22:33.185 --> 22:34.979
Garbage pickup where I live
isn't until Friday,

22:34.979 --> 22:36.897
so if you want it,
it's yours.

22:40.401 --> 22:44.071
I'm sorry. You said you found me
through Kamile Volodka's phone?

22:44.071 --> 22:45.990
We haven't been able
to unlock it yet,

22:45.990 --> 22:48.701
but her calendar app
was set to send alerts

22:48.701 --> 22:51.161
through the lock screen.
According to what we saw,

22:51.161 --> 22:52.997
you met with Kamile
the day she was killed.

22:52.997 --> 22:55.332
That was the day she died?

22:55.332 --> 22:56.959
Was she a friend of yours?

22:56.959 --> 22:59.837
Actually, I'd never
met her before.

22:59.837 --> 23:02.047
You're familiar
with the work we do here?

23:02.047 --> 23:03.048
BELL:
You're a charity

23:03.048 --> 23:05.342
who helps people get off drugs.

23:05.342 --> 23:06.885
Was Kamile someone
you were treating?

23:06.885 --> 23:11.098
No. Her sister was. Regina.

23:11.098 --> 23:14.143
We've been trying to get
in touch with Regina.

23:14.143 --> 23:15.352
If you have
any information...

23:15.352 --> 23:16.895
I'm sorry,

23:16.895 --> 23:20.858
but Regina died from a heroin
overdose almost ten months ago.

23:20.858 --> 23:23.902
Kamile and Regina,

23:23.902 --> 23:25.863
they fell out of touch
when Regina's addiction

23:25.863 --> 23:27.489
got really bad.

23:27.489 --> 23:29.908
By the time Regina died,
they hadn't spoken in months.

23:29.908 --> 23:32.161
Kamile was

23:32.161 --> 23:34.538
carrying a lot of guilt around.

23:34.538 --> 23:36.123
She took a modeling job
in New York

23:36.123 --> 23:37.916
just so she could meet with me.

23:37.916 --> 23:39.501
She wanted to know
if there was anything

23:39.501 --> 23:41.920
she could've done
to save her sister.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.922
I told her the truth.

23:43.922 --> 23:47.926
Opiate addiction
is a monster.

23:47.926 --> 23:50.763
And sometimes,
no matter what we do,

23:50.763 --> 23:52.556
we're gonna lose the person
we care about.

23:52.556 --> 23:56.143
Did Kamile seem
troubled that day?

23:56.143 --> 23:57.686
Any concerns she
might be in danger?

23:57.686 --> 24:00.898
No.

24:00.898 --> 24:02.566
Did you notice anyone suspicious
in the restaurant?

24:02.566 --> 24:04.026
Was anyone following her?

24:04.026 --> 24:06.445
I noticed a few men
checking her out.

24:06.445 --> 24:09.031
She was beautiful,

24:09.031 --> 24:10.282
but none of them
seemed threatening.

24:12.201 --> 24:15.871
If you'd like, I can give you
Regina's case file.

24:15.871 --> 24:18.040
I went over it
with Kamile,

24:18.040 --> 24:20.084
but I'm afraid
that's all I've got.

24:20.084 --> 24:21.293
I'm sorry I can't be more help.

24:23.504 --> 24:24.797
(doorbell chimes)

24:28.384 --> 24:30.052
(New York accent):
Hey, how you doing?

24:30.052 --> 24:32.262
Oh, can I help you?
Yeah, I'm with
the gas company.

24:32.262 --> 24:33.931
We got a report of a leak
in the area.

24:33.931 --> 24:35.599
I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to check your house.

24:35.599 --> 24:37.643
Oh, do you have to
do it right now?

24:37.643 --> 24:39.728
Yeah, I'm afraid so.
We-we get some buildups,

24:39.728 --> 24:41.689
there's a spark
in the wrong place,

24:41.689 --> 24:43.565
real bad things can happen,
you know?

24:43.565 --> 24:46.276
Well, we don't want that.
No. All right.

24:51.240 --> 24:55.077
Yeah, I'm gonna start down here,
if that's okay with you.
Sure.

24:55.077 --> 24:58.247
Whatever you need.
What's all this for?

24:58.247 --> 25:01.542
Oh. Are you familiar
with podcasts? (chuckles)

25:01.542 --> 25:03.419
My son does one.
He records it down here.

25:03.419 --> 25:05.713
All right. What's it about?

25:05.713 --> 25:09.550
Um, historical mysteries,
strange occurrences.

25:09.550 --> 25:11.802
He can explain it
better than me.

25:11.802 --> 25:14.179
He should be back from
teaching in an hour or so

25:14.179 --> 25:16.181
if you're curious.

25:16.181 --> 25:19.601
No, I-I think I'll be
out of your hair by then.

25:19.601 --> 25:21.186
(coughing)

25:21.186 --> 25:24.148
I'm sorry, could I trouble you
for a glass of water?

25:24.148 --> 25:25.566
Of course. I'll be right back.

25:25.566 --> 25:27.484
Thank you.

25:53.135 --> 25:56.054
(bag thuds loudly)

25:56.054 --> 25:58.432
Pretty sure that bag was not
that heavy when you left.

25:58.432 --> 25:59.683
(normal voice):
Yeah.

25:59.683 --> 26:01.351
It wasn't holding a pistol
and several boxes

26:01.351 --> 26:02.811
of ammunition
when I left.

26:02.811 --> 26:05.105
You found that at
Wesley Conrad's parents' house?

26:05.105 --> 26:08.192
The pistol itself is quite new.

26:08.192 --> 26:09.943
I assume he got it
during his trip to Vermont.

26:11.904 --> 26:14.573
So what do you think?
Was Odin right about him?

26:14.573 --> 26:16.909
It's certainly possible that
Conrad has murder on his mind.

26:16.909 --> 26:18.911
If he does,
minds can be changed.

26:18.911 --> 26:19.953
Sherlock...
Taking his gun

26:19.953 --> 26:22.039
away from him is only
part of my plan.

26:22.039 --> 26:23.874
I'm not finished with him yet,
not by any means.

26:23.874 --> 26:27.336
The file you got
on Kamile Volodka's sister,

26:27.336 --> 26:29.129
anything useful in it?

26:29.129 --> 26:33.634
Yes and no. The file itself
tells a pretty familiar story.

26:33.634 --> 26:36.220
Regina wanted to quit heroin,
but it was hard.

26:36.220 --> 26:38.806
She relapsed more than once.
Still, it got me thinking,

26:38.806 --> 26:40.724
the social worker
who oversaw her case

26:40.724 --> 26:42.434
said that Kamile
felt a lot of guilt

26:42.434 --> 26:44.186
about what happened to Regina.

26:44.186 --> 26:46.563
So maybe that's what drove her
to go and find the person

26:46.563 --> 26:48.398
who sold the drugs to Regina
that killed her.

26:48.398 --> 26:50.692
And that person realized
that she was onto them.

26:50.692 --> 26:52.778
They went to the model apartment
and killed her.

26:52.778 --> 26:54.947
Regina was arrested
for possession once.

26:54.947 --> 26:57.574
I asked Marcus to get anything
the police had on her.

26:57.574 --> 27:00.410
I was hoping she told the police
where she got her drugs.

27:00.410 --> 27:02.287
And?
The arrest report
was a bust.

27:02.287 --> 27:04.873
Nothing jumped out.

27:04.873 --> 27:06.875
Coroner's report on her
overdose, on the other hand,

27:06.875 --> 27:08.460
take a look.
I think you'll come

27:08.460 --> 27:09.837
to the same conclusion
that I did.

27:09.837 --> 27:12.673
Regina Volodka was murdered
ten months ago,

27:12.673 --> 27:14.174
probably by the same person

27:14.174 --> 27:15.968
who killed her sister
two nights ago.

27:21.348 --> 27:23.725
I don't know what to tell you.
I stand by my work.

27:23.725 --> 27:27.855
Regina Volodka's death
was accidental. She OD'd.

27:27.855 --> 27:31.984
You didn't make note of these
two marks in your report.

27:31.984 --> 27:34.027
I'm assuming you missed them?

27:34.027 --> 27:37.614
Honestly,
I don't remember.

27:37.614 --> 27:40.742
She was dead for two days
before her body was found.

27:40.742 --> 27:42.035
Given the level
of livor mortis,

27:42.035 --> 27:44.204
these could be anything.

27:44.204 --> 27:46.790
Bruises or bug bites
or a dozen other things.

27:46.790 --> 27:49.835
See, we don't agree.

27:49.835 --> 27:52.588
Given the size and spacing,
we think those are burn marks

27:52.588 --> 27:55.716
left by a stun gun.
She was subdued,

27:55.716 --> 27:58.927
and then someone else injected
her with a fatal dose of heroin.

27:58.927 --> 28:01.722
This was a murder
and you missed it.

28:01.722 --> 28:03.974
BELL: According to your report,
there was only

28:03.974 --> 28:05.434
a single needle stick on Regina,

28:05.434 --> 28:08.145
so she wasn't using much
before she died, if at all.

28:08.145 --> 28:09.938
There were no works
found with the body,

28:09.938 --> 28:11.523
and based on blood pooling,

28:11.523 --> 28:13.734
she was moved a few hours
after she died.

28:13.734 --> 28:15.319
You missed that, too.

28:15.319 --> 28:17.988
The person that killed
Regina Volodka got away.

28:17.988 --> 28:20.365
And now it looks like
he's killed her sister

28:20.365 --> 28:21.408
for good measure.

28:21.408 --> 28:22.993
What?

28:22.993 --> 28:26.747
She was attacked with a stun gun
a few days ago,

28:26.747 --> 28:28.206
then suffocated.

28:28.206 --> 28:30.334
HARDY: The burn marks
do look like a match.

28:30.334 --> 28:31.877
Do you remember anything else

28:31.877 --> 28:33.670
from the morning
you autopsied Regina?

28:33.670 --> 28:36.173
Anything that might point us
in someone's direction?

28:36.173 --> 28:38.550
No, I can't help you.

28:38.550 --> 28:42.721
But I might know
someone who can.

28:42.721 --> 28:46.600
Last month, a private detective
came to see me, Baxter Lim.

28:46.600 --> 28:48.977
He was asking about
Regina Volodka.

28:48.977 --> 28:51.563
He wanted a copy of my report.

28:51.563 --> 28:53.899
I assumed it was just
an insurance thing, but...

28:53.899 --> 28:56.360
But maybe Kamile was the one
who hired him.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.362
She suspected foul play.

28:58.362 --> 29:01.740
If Baxter saw what you
saw in these pictures,

29:01.740 --> 29:04.618
if he had information from
the sister that you didn't,

29:04.618 --> 29:06.995
it's possible he's already
on someone's trail.

29:09.706 --> 29:14.252
Baxter Lim's office address
is 1128 1/2. Home is 1128.

29:14.252 --> 29:17.047
I'm guessing that's
the office back there.

29:17.047 --> 29:21.259
CCS says, according to
Kamile Volodka's Venmo account,

29:21.259 --> 29:24.513
she sent Baxter Lim $500
a few days before she died.

29:24.513 --> 29:26.848
One of the models told you
she overheard a call

29:26.848 --> 29:28.767
between Kamile and
someone who was asking

29:28.767 --> 29:30.894
for $500, right?

29:30.894 --> 29:33.271
Guessing I was right
about her hiring this guy

29:33.271 --> 29:34.147
to look into her
sister's death.

29:36.525 --> 29:39.027
Baxter Lim? NYPD.

29:39.027 --> 29:41.196
Marcus.

29:43.323 --> 29:46.159
(flies buzzing)
Those are corpse flies.

29:54.835 --> 29:56.003
Baxter Lim?

29:59.756 --> 30:04.219
He's been dead at least
a day, maybe two.

30:04.219 --> 30:05.387
Stun gun burns.

30:09.641 --> 30:12.728
You're cutting it fine,
aren't you?

30:12.728 --> 30:15.313
Less than five hours
before Bertram Iwan

30:15.313 --> 30:18.233
screens his documentary.
What's the verdict?

30:21.945 --> 30:23.572
This for me?

30:23.572 --> 30:26.658
It's safe. Your henchmen
already checked it out.

30:26.658 --> 30:29.661
What is it?

30:29.661 --> 30:32.664
It's a gun. Recently procured
by Wesley Conrad.

30:33.874 --> 30:35.459
I took a saw to it.

30:35.459 --> 30:38.837
I don't suppose you took a saw
to him, as well, did you?

30:38.837 --> 30:40.547
You were right to come to me.

30:40.547 --> 30:41.715
I'll handle this
from here.

30:41.715 --> 30:44.342
No, I didn't come here
to seal Conrad's fate.

30:44.342 --> 30:45.677
I came here
to let you know

30:45.677 --> 30:49.347
that the situation is in hand.

30:49.347 --> 30:51.975
Obviously, my intel was right.
He's planning a shooting.

30:51.975 --> 30:55.312
Maybe. Maybe not.

30:55.312 --> 30:57.272
If he is, there are ways
of stopping him

30:57.272 --> 30:59.441
which do not entail his murder.

30:59.441 --> 31:02.569
Do you honestly think that this

31:02.569 --> 31:04.988
is going to guarantee
he won't hurt anyone?

31:04.988 --> 31:06.865
He could have more guns.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.200
And if he doesn't--
this isn't England--

31:08.200 --> 31:09.701
he could already
have another one.

31:09.701 --> 31:11.536
I paid him a visit.

31:11.536 --> 31:14.206
I put him in touch with a law
firm who are going to help him

31:14.206 --> 31:16.208
resolve his grievances
without violence.

31:16.208 --> 31:20.420
They report that he called
and sounded encouraged.

31:20.420 --> 31:22.297
According to his e-mails,
he's already tried lawyers

31:22.297 --> 31:23.882
and they always let him down.

31:23.882 --> 31:27.969
You're referring to old data.
I'm bringing you new data.

31:27.969 --> 31:29.387
Would you consider it?

31:31.598 --> 31:34.476
Well, that is a shame.

31:34.476 --> 31:36.311
I must admit,
you do have a knack

31:36.311 --> 31:38.480
for identifying people
who may pose a threat.

31:38.480 --> 31:41.066
"May"?
Not everyone who gets angry
commits a murder.

31:41.066 --> 31:42.901
Not everyone who buys a gun
commits a murder,

31:42.901 --> 31:44.444
even though it might
feel like it sometimes.

31:44.444 --> 31:45.987
Sherlock...
I agree

31:45.987 --> 31:47.489
Conrad may still be dangerous,

31:47.489 --> 31:49.866
so I shared my concerns
with the police

31:49.866 --> 31:52.369
and with the company providing
security at the theater tonight.

31:52.369 --> 31:54.621
If he comes within 100 yards of
the place, he will be stopped.

31:54.621 --> 31:58.834
Say you're right.
Tonight, Bertram Iwan is safe.

31:58.834 --> 32:01.211
What about tomorrow?
Or the day after that?

32:01.211 --> 32:02.796
I'll keep an eye on Conrad.

32:02.796 --> 32:05.590
I could give you the names of
100 would-be killers right now.

32:05.590 --> 32:07.717
Are you going to keep an eye
on them as well?

32:07.717 --> 32:09.553
That's more than I could handle.

32:09.553 --> 32:11.972
That's more than
anyone could handle.

32:11.972 --> 32:15.142
Except, perhaps,
a billionaire tech mogul

32:15.142 --> 32:16.935
with the resources
of a small country.

32:16.935 --> 32:21.648
You want me to change my ways.

32:21.648 --> 32:23.650
Find a way to babysit
these people.

32:23.650 --> 32:25.569
Protect them
from themselves.

32:25.569 --> 32:28.280
What you're talking about,

32:28.280 --> 32:30.699
engaging them the way
that you just engaged Conrad,

32:30.699 --> 32:32.200
observing them for years,

32:32.200 --> 32:35.036
it would require
much more manpower.

32:35.036 --> 32:36.830
There would be more risk
of exposure...

32:36.830 --> 32:38.999
Killing people's easier, is it?

32:38.999 --> 32:40.500
Oh, well, I suppose
that makes it all right.

32:46.548 --> 32:48.341
Sherlock.

32:48.341 --> 32:51.261
Let's say

32:51.261 --> 32:55.932
I would consider revising
the way I do things...

32:55.932 --> 32:58.018
you and Joan would help?

32:58.018 --> 33:00.562
Call us. Find out.

33:06.484 --> 33:08.111
Hey, how'd it go?

33:08.111 --> 33:10.071
With Odin Reichenbach?
Difficult to say.

33:10.071 --> 33:11.740
Wesley Conrad?
So far, so good.

33:11.740 --> 33:13.867
So he stayed away
from the screening tonight?

33:13.867 --> 33:15.160
I've had eyes on
his parents' home

33:15.160 --> 33:16.786
since yesterday;
he's still there.

33:16.786 --> 33:18.288
Bertram Iwan,
meanwhile,

33:18.288 --> 33:20.081
is just wrapping
up his Q&A,

33:20.081 --> 33:22.167
should be on a plane back
to London by midnight.

33:22.167 --> 33:24.586
What's all this?
These are screenshots

33:24.586 --> 33:26.463
and photos
taken by Baxter Lim.

33:26.463 --> 33:28.340
The late private detective?
Yeah.

33:28.340 --> 33:29.966
So Marcus and I

33:29.966 --> 33:32.219
are now pretty sure
that he and Kamile were killed

33:32.219 --> 33:34.137
because they were looking into
what happened to Regina.

33:34.137 --> 33:36.806
We wanted to take a look
at his notes on the case.

33:36.806 --> 33:38.683
But the killer
absconded with them.

33:38.683 --> 33:40.936
Along with Baxter's phone
and hard drive.

33:40.936 --> 33:42.354
And yet you
have all these.

33:42.354 --> 33:43.688
They're from the cloud?
Yeah.

33:43.688 --> 33:44.940
Well, there are
thousands of them.

33:44.940 --> 33:46.983
I hit "print all"
an hour ago.

33:46.983 --> 33:48.401
I've just been
separating the ones

33:48.401 --> 33:50.111
that I think might have
something to do with

33:50.111 --> 33:51.863
his investigation
into Regina.

33:51.863 --> 33:53.949
A bar where she worked.

33:53.949 --> 33:56.117
The nonprofit where
she got her counseling.

33:56.117 --> 33:57.994
And the place she was found.

33:57.994 --> 33:59.579
This one's interesting.

33:59.579 --> 34:01.206
What is that?

34:01.206 --> 34:03.166
Photo of her with some
character from a theme park?

34:03.166 --> 34:05.627
Note the caption.

34:05.627 --> 34:07.212
"Pandasalt, titan
of the turntables,

34:07.212 --> 34:08.546
attacks the scene."

34:08.546 --> 34:10.048
He's a DJ?

34:10.048 --> 34:11.591
More than a few of them

34:11.591 --> 34:13.843
have taken to
wearing masks recently.

34:13.843 --> 34:16.388
Anonymity has become hip.

34:16.388 --> 34:19.057
As you said, that appears
to be from the Internet.

34:19.057 --> 34:21.810
The rest seem to be
taken by Lim himself.

34:21.810 --> 34:23.603
You think the two
of them were dating?

34:23.603 --> 34:25.855
Well, that would explain why
Lim was looking into him.

34:25.855 --> 34:28.400
Unfortunately,
Pandasalt's name

34:28.400 --> 34:30.235
is as big a mystery as his face.

34:30.235 --> 34:32.487
Absolutely no one
knows who he is.

She's also
a trained musicologist

35:06.229 --> 35:07.981
and she's helping me
identify Pandasalt

35:07.981 --> 35:11.192
by playing known artists
with similar styles.

35:11.192 --> 35:13.945
You think one of them
is Pandasalt?

35:13.945 --> 35:16.448
Well, so far, we've reviewed

It sounds like
one of his songs.

were together for a while,

but if you think
I would ever hurt her...

36:00.367 --> 36:02.994
I didn't even know
she was dead until you told me.

36:04.788 --> 36:06.831
"My girlfriend drives me
crazy and sometimes

36:06.831 --> 36:08.083
I want to kill her."

36:08.083 --> 36:10.168
You posted that, right?

36:10.168 --> 36:14.005
Yes, but I-I wasn't...
being literal.

36:14.005 --> 36:16.716
Regina had problems;
she was a heroin addict.

36:16.716 --> 36:19.260
A fact her killer took full
advantage of ten months ago;

36:19.260 --> 36:21.137
made her death look like an OD.

36:21.137 --> 36:24.099
What, you think I'm the only one
who knew that she was on drugs?

36:24.099 --> 36:25.350
We think you're
the only person

36:25.350 --> 36:27.102
who ever talked
about killing her.

36:27.102 --> 36:29.771
Ten months ago,
I wasn't even in the country.

36:29.771 --> 36:32.315
I was, I was halfway through
a ten-week tour

36:32.315 --> 36:34.526
of South America.
HOLMES: We're aware.

36:34.526 --> 36:37.153
We have a picture of you
playing in Brazil

36:37.153 --> 36:38.738
the night that Regina died.

36:38.738 --> 36:41.157
So what are we even doing here?

36:41.157 --> 36:43.201
Did you forget
you perform in a mask?

36:43.201 --> 36:44.202
Could have been anyone
in those pictures.

36:46.496 --> 36:48.164
I have friends in Brazil.

36:48.164 --> 36:49.374
Reach out to them,
they'll tell you.

36:49.374 --> 36:50.542
I was hanging
out with them

36:50.542 --> 36:52.210
backstage that night
without the mask.

36:53.545 --> 36:55.338
They can probably
even send you pictures.

36:55.338 --> 36:57.549
Names and numbers.
No.

36:57.549 --> 36:59.634
No, first you tell me
where my daughter is.

36:59.634 --> 37:02.053
Why would we know
where your daughter is?

37:02.053 --> 37:03.805
Regina's daughter, whatever.

37:06.516 --> 37:08.643
A few months before
the Brazil show, I was in Lima.

37:08.643 --> 37:11.229
Regina called me,
said that she'd gotten clean

37:11.229 --> 37:12.647
and that she was pregnant.

37:12.647 --> 37:15.817
She said it was a girl
and that it was mine.

37:15.817 --> 37:17.944
The M.E. who performed
Regina's autopsy

37:17.944 --> 37:19.612
missed a few things;
maybe she missed that

37:19.612 --> 37:21.823
Regina was pregnant
when she died.

37:21.823 --> 37:23.074
No, you don't get it.
She'd already had the baby

37:23.074 --> 37:25.326
by then.
BELL: Back up a second.

37:25.326 --> 37:27.412
You said she called you in Lima,
told you she was pregnant...

37:27.412 --> 37:28.997
Yeah, she said
she didn't need anything,

37:28.997 --> 37:30.498
she just wanted me to know.

37:30.498 --> 37:31.916
She said she was
thinking of giving

37:31.916 --> 37:34.502
the baby to some
private adoption agency.

37:34.502 --> 37:36.713
That probably explains
where your daughter is now.

37:36.713 --> 37:38.882
Doesn't it?
No, no, 'cause I
talked her out of it.

37:38.882 --> 37:41.801
I told her I'd be there for her
and give her child support.

37:41.801 --> 37:43.803
Anything she wanted.
She said she'd think about it.

37:43.803 --> 37:45.263
Then,

37:45.263 --> 37:48.266
when I was in Brazil,
Regina called me again.

37:48.266 --> 37:49.893
She said she was
at the hospital.

37:49.893 --> 37:51.644
She'd just had the baby.

37:51.644 --> 37:53.480
She told me
she'd changed her mind.

37:53.480 --> 37:57.317
She told the adoption agency
she was going to keep it.

37:57.317 --> 38:00.153
She said she'd call me
if she ever needed anything.

38:02.155 --> 38:03.114
Give us a minute, would you?

38:11.956 --> 38:14.792
Assuming everything he says
is true, he was in Brazil

38:14.792 --> 38:17.212
the same day that Regina called
to say she'd had her baby.

38:17.212 --> 38:20.423
Based on our timeline,
that's the same day she died.

38:20.423 --> 38:22.801
That would mean she was killed
not long after she delivered.

38:22.801 --> 38:25.261
More specifically, it was
not long after she told

38:25.261 --> 38:27.055
the adoption agency she
was keeping the baby.

38:27.055 --> 38:28.973
We never had a motive
for Regina's death.

38:28.973 --> 38:30.808
Perhaps now we do.

38:30.808 --> 38:32.644
Whoever killed her
wanted her baby.

38:32.644 --> 38:35.021
So this wouldn't just be
a string of homicides.

38:35.021 --> 38:36.648
Could be a kidnapping, too.

38:43.655 --> 38:45.448
Wow.

38:45.448 --> 38:48.201
I don't even know
what to say to that.

38:48.201 --> 38:50.703
You think she
was lying to him?

38:50.703 --> 38:53.373
My guess is, she was
trying to get money out of him.

38:53.373 --> 38:56.501
The first time she called, she
said she didn't want anything.

38:56.501 --> 38:58.628
She'd already lined up
a private adoption.

38:58.628 --> 39:02.549
In my experience,
addicts make great con artists.

39:02.549 --> 39:04.968
Maybe she was
setting the table.

39:04.968 --> 39:06.761
The request for money
was going to come later.

39:06.761 --> 39:09.472
In your notes in the file
that you gave to my partner,

39:09.472 --> 39:11.599
you said you last saw
Regina in October.

39:11.599 --> 39:14.185
Her second phone call
to her ex-boyfriend,

39:14.185 --> 39:15.895
in which she told him
she'd just given birth,

39:15.895 --> 39:17.355
came in November.

39:17.355 --> 39:20.024
Exactly. You don't
think I would notice

39:20.024 --> 39:22.610
that she was
eight months pregnant?

39:22.610 --> 39:24.404
What?

39:24.404 --> 39:27.407
Regina's ex let us look
at his phone records.

39:27.407 --> 39:30.034
We were able to verify
that she did give him a call

39:30.034 --> 39:31.578
in the middle of November.

39:31.578 --> 39:32.870
When we looked for
the corresponding call

39:32.870 --> 39:33.955
in her records,

39:33.955 --> 39:35.415
the cell tower data

39:35.415 --> 39:37.375
put her in the vicinity
of a hospital.

39:37.375 --> 39:38.793
We went there.
They confirmed that

39:38.793 --> 39:41.004
Regina gave birth to a
baby girl that night.

39:41.004 --> 39:43.006
They also gave
us access

39:43.006 --> 39:44.799
to their security
camera footage.

39:44.799 --> 39:47.010
This is a picture
of you picking her

39:47.010 --> 39:49.012
and her baby up
at the hospital,

39:49.012 --> 39:50.513
after they were
discharged.

39:50.513 --> 39:52.640
BELL: You were acting
as a go-between for her

39:52.640 --> 39:54.892
and an adoption agency,
just like you have

39:54.892 --> 39:57.645
for other pregnant addicts
who came here for help.

39:57.645 --> 39:58.980
HOLMES: You're smiling
in that photograph.

39:58.980 --> 40:01.816
I assume she hadn't yet told you
she was going to keep the baby.

40:01.816 --> 40:04.694
When she did, you obviously
didn't want to lose your cut

40:04.694 --> 40:06.279
of the fee the adoptive parents

40:06.279 --> 40:07.989
agreed to pay Regina
and the agency.

40:07.989 --> 40:09.991
So, you killed her.

40:09.991 --> 40:11.784
Pumped her full of heroin,

40:11.784 --> 40:13.995
left her body somewhere
you knew it would be found.

40:13.995 --> 40:16.039
(exhales)

40:16.039 --> 40:18.583
All three of you
sound like you're on drugs.

40:18.583 --> 40:21.002
You should take
one of our brochures.

40:21.002 --> 40:22.420
Think about getting some help.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.255
BELL: Oh, we've
got some help.

40:24.255 --> 40:27.759
Our colleagues are searching
your home as we speak.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.594
They're looking for the stun gun
you used on Regina,

40:29.594 --> 40:31.596
her sister and Baxter Lim.

40:33.848 --> 40:35.767
Judging by that look,
I think they're gonna find it.

40:41.272 --> 40:42.523

went off without a hitch.

41:11.219 --> 41:13.388
We confirmed this morning that
he got home safely to London.

41:13.388 --> 41:15.682
He's not in any danger
from Conrad.

41:15.682 --> 41:17.183

You're right.

41:17.183 --> 41:20.186

And now,
thanks to the three of us,

41:41.791 --> 41:44.419
two innocent people
are dead.

41:44.419 --> 41:46.170
There was nothing in
the data you gave us

41:46.170 --> 41:48.589
that suggested a problem
between him and his parents.

41:48.589 --> 41:50.675
No, but it did say
that he's a killer

41:50.675 --> 41:52.260
and I was right about that.

41:54.595 --> 41:56.180
You asked me
if I'd been thinking about

41:56.180 --> 41:57.682
changing the way
I do things.

41:57.682 --> 42:00.226
I was.
And I've decided...

42:00.226 --> 42:02.228
I'm not changing a thing.

42:02.228 --> 42:05.857
Now... get out.
