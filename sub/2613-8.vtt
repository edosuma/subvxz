00:08.180 --> 00:10.007
You're gonna get it.

00:10.140 --> 00:12.014
Oh, you're gonna get it!

00:13.143 --> 00:14.092
I got you.

00:14.227 --> 00:16.219
I got you. I got you!

00:17.397 --> 00:18.346
I got you.

00:20.000 --> 00:26.074

00:27.866 --> 00:29.859
Butchy, what's wrong?

00:29.993 --> 00:32.698
Keep going.

00:33.789 --> 00:34.488
(Screams)

00:49.721 --> 00:52.758
You've been walking in circles for ten minutes.

00:52.891 --> 00:54.884
There's no sign of struggle.

00:55.018 --> 00:57.889
Whatever happened
happened somewhere else.

00:58.021 --> 01:01.271
- This is a secondary scene.
- Body dump?

01:01.400 --> 01:07.189
Textbook. David, when we dig her up,
I want you to tag her "special processing".

01:07.322 --> 01:10.407
The only person who knows
where the crime scene is

01:10.534 --> 01:12.526
has a mouthful of sand.

01:12.661 --> 01:15.330
A thousand square miles of desert in Vegas,

01:15.414 --> 01:17.952
this perp dumps the body in a sandbox!

01:18.083 --> 01:20.076
He didn't put it here to hide it.

01:20.210 --> 01:23.081
He put it here to be found.

01:57.998 --> 01:59.991
What do you think?

02:00.125 --> 02:02.912
I think we got
a van full of tools we can't use

02:03.045 --> 02:05.037
Sand's a nightmare.

02:05.172 --> 02:08.338
To get to the evidence
we may destroy the evidence.

02:08.467 --> 02:12.511
Do you get these haikus out of a book
or do they just come to you?

02:12.638 --> 02:15.804
Every time you find a body
you have to choose a path.

02:15.933 --> 02:18.602
And when you take that path, grasshopper,

02:18.685 --> 02:20.844
you risk destroying the evidence.

02:20.979 --> 02:23.649
We grab a trowel and some fine mesh screens

02:23.732 --> 02:26.899
and we just pretend
like we're panning for gold...

02:27.027 --> 02:29.020
Master.

03:35.470 --> 03:38.008
Gunshot victim shipped to Desert Palms.

03:38.140 --> 03:41.176
Santee Cherna, 32.
Runs this cheque-cashing joint.

03:41.310 --> 03:45.806
- Cash business, huh?
- Shot in the leg making his weekly bank run.

03:45.939 --> 03:48.146
Let me guess. The guy makes his runs

03:48.275 --> 03:50.433
- same time every week.
- Night deposit.

03:50.569 --> 03:52.727
He's either stupid or suicidal!

03:52.863 --> 03:55.947
We can't arrest people for that. Unfortunately.

03:56.074 --> 03:58.067
The whole thing went down here.

03:58.201 --> 04:01.072
The sister heard a gunshot.
Saw a car take off.

04:01.204 --> 04:03.197
OK. I'm gonna do a once-around.

04:03.332 --> 04:05.324
All right. I'll take the lot.

07:09.101 --> 07:11.093
You run this car already?

07:11.228 --> 07:14.063
Oh, yeah. The RO's our vic. That's his spot.

07:14.189 --> 07:16.182
Oh, yeah?

07:16.316 --> 07:18.309
Hey, Warrick, check this out.

07:24.700 --> 07:27.487
We're dealing with some criminal geniuses.

07:27.619 --> 07:31.284
Grab the moneybag, slice it and run.

07:31.415 --> 07:34.499
You forgot er...
leave the evidence on the ground.

07:34.626 --> 07:36.619
Let's see.

07:40.215 --> 07:42.208
We got some cheques.

07:42.342 --> 07:44.335
No cash.

07:45.429 --> 07:49.011
And a deposit slip for $22,500.

07:49.141 --> 07:53.850
So our victim breaks out of the store
with a bag full of dough.

07:53.979 --> 07:57.562
- Same time every week.
- I guess somebody was casing the joint.

07:57.691 --> 08:00.727
Or... it was an inside job.

08:02.696 --> 08:06.112
This morning everything was fine.
Then some penejo attacks my brother,

08:06.241 --> 08:09.859
and we're out God knows how much money
and I'm stuck running the place alone.

08:09.995 --> 08:11.738
Mrs Delgado, I know you're upset.

08:11.872 --> 08:16.201
Upset is for white people, lady. I'm pissed off.

08:16.335 --> 08:20.913
My brother was shot in the thigh. That's awful
close to serious, if you know what I'm saying.

08:21.048 --> 08:25.176
- Mrs Delgado, how long have you been here?
- Six years.

08:25.302 --> 08:28.172
- You have insurance?
- You'd better have insurance!

08:28.305 --> 08:31.674
You take 6% of a man's paycheck to cash it?
People use us,

08:31.808 --> 08:34.299
- but they don't like us.
- Thank you.

08:41.109 --> 08:42.058
So...

08:42.193 --> 08:44.899
You think the brother might be behind this?

08:45.030 --> 08:47.817
Well, I might bet my own paycheck on that one.

08:47.950 --> 08:51.235
If that's true,
our vic gets to collect the insurance money.

08:51.370 --> 08:53.825
Plus he gets to keep
the money he stole from himself.

08:53.956 --> 08:55.747
Nice scam.

08:55.874 --> 08:59.872
What's the first thing you do when you see
one of these on your windshield?

09:00.003 --> 09:01.996
- Chuck it.
- Exactly.

09:02.130 --> 09:04.835
But the only guy to chuck his was the victim.

09:04.967 --> 09:07.884
I found one on the ground next to his car.

09:08.011 --> 09:11.214
So whoever put these here
wasn't gone long when the brother was shot.

09:12.683 --> 09:13.963
Potential eyewitness.

09:14.101 --> 09:18.561
She died two to four hours
before she was discovered. Jury's still out

09:18.689 --> 09:20.562
on cause of death.

09:20.691 --> 09:24.640
But considering the whip
and ligature mark s, it was violent.

09:24.778 --> 09:27.981
Some of the scars on her back are old.
Some are fresh.

09:28.115 --> 09:31.400
What are we looking at? Rape?
Multiple sexual assaults?

09:31.535 --> 09:35.485
That's the strange part.
Her body's a road map of abuse,

09:35.622 --> 09:37.615
but there's no sign it was sexual.

09:37.749 --> 09:39.576
She hasn't had intercourse in months.

09:39.710 --> 09:43.790
I'm thinking trade-in. Some lowlife
is tired of beating on the old model,

09:43.922 --> 09:48.335
so he punches her ticket
and starts shopping around for version 2.0.

09:48.468 --> 09:51.635
Here's a woman who's been beaten
on a regular basis,

09:51.763 --> 09:54.681
but look at the care she's lavished on herself.

09:54.808 --> 09:57.762
Manicured fingernails. Manicured toenails.

09:57.894 --> 09:59.887
Perfect teeth.

10:00.022 --> 10:02.145
Hair.

10:04.359 --> 10:07.526
Not to mention
some serious breast augmentation.

10:09.489 --> 10:11.447
That is not a Tijuana boob job.

10:11.575 --> 10:13.698
Those puppies are top of the line.

10:13.827 --> 10:17.113
Looks like a pair of saline leads.
Can you grab me one of those?

10:17.247 --> 10:19.821
- Left or right?
- Dealer's choice.

10:26.173 --> 10:29.838
What up, Einstein?
Ooh! You got anything there?

10:29.968 --> 10:33.503
You think Einstein had people
hovering over his shoulders?

10:33.639 --> 10:38.217
If he did, would we be walking around
with E = mc^2 T-shirts?

10:42.481 --> 10:46.146
Would you step back?
Just give me some breathing room.

10:46.276 --> 10:50.819
Maybe I'll tell you about the silver sliver
Grissom found on Sandbox Girl's back.

10:50.948 --> 10:52.358
It's all yours.

11:05.045 --> 11:07.714
Let's see what the library has to say.

11:09.633 --> 11:12.171
Tempered steel with aluminum coating.

11:12.302 --> 11:15.387
- Maybe she was chained up.
- Then she wore something funky.

11:15.514 --> 11:17.341
She was in the raw.

11:17.474 --> 11:20.843
In a manner of speaking.
You remember the sparkly stuff Grissom got?

11:20.978 --> 11:22.970
- Yeah.
- I broke it down.

11:23.105 --> 11:25.097
Tree sap, ammonia and water.

11:25.232 --> 11:28.601
- Sounds like frat house gravy.
- Liquid latex.

11:28.735 --> 11:31.570
- Never heard of it.
- Really? It's all the craze now.

11:31.697 --> 11:34.733
Girls paint it on guys. Guys paint it on girls.

11:34.866 --> 11:38.567
You can paint it on yourself,
if that's what you're into. Can't get a date.

11:38.704 --> 11:40.281
- I got it.
- Like I would know.

11:40.414 --> 11:42.406
Sure. Sure. I got it, man.

11:51.508 --> 11:53.501
Hey, is that our guy?

11:56.346 --> 11:59.098
Detective Vega. LVPD. Can I see some ID?

11:59.224 --> 12:03.388
I am a legitimate businessman. My card.

12:03.520 --> 12:05.394
How often do you distribute here?

12:05.522 --> 12:07.930
On this street? Every Thursday and Friday.

12:08.066 --> 12:10.273
- Is that a crime?
- That depends.

12:10.402 --> 12:14.400
Did you see anything unusual last night
in the parking lot at Flamingo and Rhoades?

12:14.531 --> 12:19.359
Missy, in Las Vegas unusual is
what happens when you leave the house.

12:19.494 --> 12:21.570
We can do this at the station, if you'd prefer.

12:21.705 --> 12:23.164
OK. OK.

12:23.290 --> 12:27.786
Some jerk told me if I touched his car, he'd
shove a flyer down my throat. Does that count?

12:27.919 --> 12:30.327
Maybe. Did you get a good look at him?

12:30.464 --> 12:34.296
Them. There were two.
A couple of lowlifes in baseball caps.

12:34.426 --> 12:36.584
What about the car? Did you notice the make?

12:36.720 --> 12:39.128
A Honda. Maybe.

12:39.264 --> 12:41.257
All those tin boxes look alike.

12:42.392 --> 12:45.310
Dr Cornfeld

12:45.437 --> 12:48.604
Catherine Willows, Las Vegas Crime Lab.

12:49.983 --> 12:53.851
I believe this is one of yours.

12:53.987 --> 12:57.154
Oh, yeah. 414 series.
Firm, but plenty of give.

12:57.282 --> 13:01.494
Spare me the sales pitch.
We removed that from a homicide victim.

13:01.620 --> 13:03.612
I've got a photo.

13:03.747 --> 13:08.290
Judging by the size,
she had a pretty decent pair to start with.

13:08.418 --> 13:10.956
Oh. She was a pretty girl.

13:11.088 --> 13:12.796
I'm going to need her name.

13:14.800 --> 13:18.050
Let's see. Oh, yeah. Here we go.

13:18.178 --> 13:22.342
Third-party billing. But I recognise the address.
They send me a lot of... business...

13:22.474 --> 13:25.012
Mona Taylor. She must have worked there.

13:25.143 --> 13:27.136
A real shame.

13:28.313 --> 13:32.062
I'll tell you what's a shame.
That she was so pretty and perfect

13:32.192 --> 13:35.643
and still thought she needed implants.

13:35.779 --> 13:39.646
Don't judge Mona for wanting to improve herself.
Competition's intense.

13:39.783 --> 13:43.069
Especially for a young woman in Las Vegas.
Put yourself in her shoes.

13:43.203 --> 13:45.492
Trust me. I've been in her shoes. I got out.

13:45.622 --> 13:49.490
- Oh, yeah? Why's that?
- They were killing me.

13:54.172 --> 13:56.710
Are you sure the surgeon said
this is where Mona worked?

13:56.842 --> 13:58.384
Maybe as a domestic.

13:58.510 --> 14:03.255
No domestic has a $10,000 rack.
Not even in Vegas.

14:03.390 --> 14:07.684
DMV records indicate that she hit town
from South Dakota three years ago.

14:07.811 --> 14:11.761
I figure the bright lights faded
and she snagged a sugar daddy.

14:11.898 --> 14:15.766
How much business
can one sugar daddy give a plastic surgeon?

14:15.902 --> 14:19.568
The eternal question,
to which we are about to find the answer.

14:22.701 --> 14:26.651
Let me guess.
Three police officers looking for respite

14:26.788 --> 14:30.122
from having to control and dominate
our big bad city.

14:30.250 --> 14:35.375
Close. One police officer.
Two criminalists. May we come in?

14:41.929 --> 14:44.087
(Male screams)

14:44.222 --> 14:46.974
Another happy customer.

14:47.100 --> 14:50.101
Would you prefer individual sessions,

14:50.228 --> 14:53.432
or would you like to enjoy
each other's submission?

14:56.610 --> 15:00.394
You don't have to decide now.
Please, make yourselves comfortable.

15:00.530 --> 15:03.068
And welcome to Lady Heather's dominion.

15:09.998 --> 15:11.991
That's her.

15:12.125 --> 15:15.162
"I AM 4 FUN." Right.

15:15.295 --> 15:17.288
She drove herself to work.

15:17.422 --> 15:19.996
Bet she didn't drive herself home.

15:25.806 --> 15:27.798
It's still locked.

15:33.897 --> 15:35.890
Looks clean.

15:39.778 --> 15:41.771
Hey, Catherine.

15:41.905 --> 15:43.898
Come check this out.

15:49.454 --> 15:51.447
What's that?

15:51.581 --> 15:54.618
Liquid latex. Grissom found some on the victim.

15:54.751 --> 15:58.452
Sanders did a trace analysis.
Stuff peels off like a glove.

15:58.588 --> 16:00.166
Handy.

16:00.299 --> 16:02.338
What do you think that is there?

16:02.467 --> 16:05.303
A watch?

16:05.429 --> 16:10.340
Bag it. We can get a mould
and try and track it down.

16:10.475 --> 16:13.311
Never lost one of my girls.

16:13.437 --> 16:15.595
You don't seem very upset about it.

16:15.731 --> 16:18.981
What you see and what I feel
are two different things.

16:20.152 --> 16:24.102
Were there any disturbances last night?
Did you hear screams?

16:24.239 --> 16:26.232
(Screams)

16:27.409 --> 16:30.659
It's when I don't hear screams
that I start to worry.

16:30.787 --> 16:34.655
Well, then, could you tell us
what time Mona got off?

16:34.791 --> 16:38.291
Knowing Mona, every couple of hours.
She enjoyed her work.

16:38.420 --> 16:43.627
There's no sexual contact
or anything illegal going on here, of course?

16:43.759 --> 16:47.626
Surely you don't think sexual contact
is the only means of fulfilment?

16:47.763 --> 16:51.511
Lady Heather,
you don't wanna know what I think.

16:51.642 --> 16:55.971
Her last client was at eleven.
She would have left at midnight.

16:56.104 --> 17:00.184
Do you have any kind of logbook,
some record of who was working that night,

17:00.317 --> 17:02.725
what they did with clients, that sort of thing?

17:02.861 --> 17:05.815
- Would that get you excited?
- Not particularly.

17:05.948 --> 17:08.983
But it might help us catch the creep
who murdered Mona.

17:09.117 --> 17:12.367
We need names and addresses.
We also need to know

17:12.496 --> 17:14.903
which rooms she worked,
so we can examine them.

17:15.040 --> 17:17.116
Mona worked the pool house.

17:17.250 --> 17:20.833
Give me a minute.
I have to move some clients around.

17:20.963 --> 17:24.332
On there you are

17:24.465 --> 17:27.586
Mona's car is in the driveway. It looks clean.

17:27.719 --> 17:32.049
Tow it to CSI and process the rooms
in the pool house where Mona worked last night.

17:32.182 --> 17:34.222
And you will be...?

17:34.351 --> 17:36.889
I'll be with Lady Heather.

17:37.020 --> 17:39.013
(Screams)

17:47.072 --> 17:49.065
Does all this fascinate you?

17:51.285 --> 17:54.570
Yes. I find all deviant behaviour fascinating

17:54.705 --> 18:00.043
in that to understand our human nature
we have to understand our aberrations.

18:00.127 --> 18:02.831
And you think what goes on here is aberrant?

18:04.339 --> 18:07.293
I would say that whip marks
and ligature contusions

18:07.426 --> 18:09.418
on a young woman are aberrant.

18:09.553 --> 18:11.545
Wouldn't you?

18:11.680 --> 18:14.136
Every job has its peculiar hazards.

18:14.266 --> 18:17.931
Rock stars damage their eardrums.
Football players ruin their knees.

18:18.061 --> 18:19.639
In this business it's scars.

18:19.771 --> 18:22.975
But no-one who works for me
has ever sustained a serious injury.

18:23.108 --> 18:25.777
Mona did. She died.

18:25.902 --> 18:29.318
Not because she worked here.
That's your assumption.

18:31.533 --> 18:34.071
What happens here isn't about violence.

18:35.245 --> 18:39.658
It's about challenging preconceived notions
of Victorian normalcy.

18:39.791 --> 18:43.125
Bringing people's fantasies to life,
making them acceptable.

18:43.253 --> 18:46.124
Like the theatre.

18:48.759 --> 18:52.887
It's people who don't come to places like this
that I worry about.

18:53.013 --> 18:55.504
The ones who don't have an outlet.

18:55.641 --> 18:58.048
Say... someone like yourself.

18:58.185 --> 19:00.177
Oh, I have outlets.

19:01.355 --> 19:03.347
I read.

19:04.733 --> 19:06.726
I study bugs.

19:08.111 --> 19:10.982
I sometimes even ride roller coasters.

19:11.114 --> 19:12.774
And your sex life?

19:12.908 --> 19:15.280
It doesn't involve going to the theatre.

19:17.746 --> 19:19.739
In my experience, Mr Grissom,

19:19.873 --> 19:22.909
some men go to the theatre...

19:23.043 --> 19:25.036
some men are the theatre.

19:25.170 --> 19:29.120
Either way, what I offer
is a chance for submission or control,

19:29.258 --> 19:31.795
whichever's required.

19:31.927 --> 19:36.007
Sometimes a client doesn't know
what he wants until I show him.

19:38.600 --> 19:41.554
"No man is a complete mystery
except to himself."

19:41.687 --> 19:44.012
Marcel Proust.

19:44.147 --> 19:47.516
I bet he'd have enjoyed himself here.

19:47.651 --> 19:51.779
Probably. No crime is a complete mystery either.

19:51.905 --> 19:54.989
The whip marks on Mona Taylor were fresh.

19:55.117 --> 19:58.984
That can't be.
Mona was dominant with her clients.

20:02.916 --> 20:06.332
I know that sometimes
she saw clients off the book s.

20:06.461 --> 20:09.379
I let her because she brought in
so much business.

20:09.506 --> 20:12.175
I just assumed
she knew what she was doing.

20:12.301 --> 20:15.551
My guess is that one of her off-the-book clients...

20:16.722 --> 20:18.714
...is a regular.

20:19.891 --> 20:21.884
I mean...

20:22.019 --> 20:24.095
it is a repeat business, is it not?

20:29.526 --> 20:32.100
Does that one interest you?

20:32.237 --> 20:34.230
Yes, it does.

20:34.364 --> 20:36.690
May I borrow it?

20:39.036 --> 20:41.028
You dirty little stink boy!

20:41.163 --> 20:43.239
(Man groans)

20:47.544 --> 20:49.750
Randolph, you may lick my boots and go.

20:49.880 --> 20:52.287
- Is it because I'm naughty?
- Shut up!

20:56.678 --> 21:00.178
I feel like I'm trapped
in the Marquis de Sade's brainpan

21:00.307 --> 21:03.758
I guess Lady Heather
hasn't quite cleared this room yet

21:03.894 --> 21:06.848
Waiting for recess.

21:31.004 --> 21:35.631
Didn't Grissom say
he found flecks of silver on the victim's back?

21:35.759 --> 21:36.790
Yean

21:38.595 --> 21:40.588
I may have found the source.

21:41.765 --> 21:43.758
Mm-hm.

21:58.073 --> 22:00.066
Hey, hey!

22:00.200 --> 22:03.865
Liquid latex. The kind we found
in the dumpster and on the vic.

22:03.996 --> 22:06.451
Hand me a bindle, will you?

22:06.581 --> 22:08.574
You know what I just realised?

22:08.709 --> 22:10.867
None of this weirds me out any more.

22:13.088 --> 22:16.422
People are just as twisted
in their own living rooms.

22:16.550 --> 22:19.219
The props are different here, that's all.

22:19.303 --> 22:21.295
Not everybody's twisted.

22:21.430 --> 22:24.265
Everybody, Nick.
Wake up and smell the species.

22:24.391 --> 22:27.226
Catherine, do you really think
that those freaks out there

22:27.352 --> 22:30.768
running round with their little dog collars on,
getting spanked,

22:30.897 --> 22:32.855
are the same as you and me?

22:32.983 --> 22:35.853
Just because you never did
doesn't mean you never could.

22:35.986 --> 22:38.025
No way. Never gonna happen.

22:38.155 --> 22:42.152
Relax, Nick. All I'm saying is you're human.

22:42.284 --> 22:46.068
Hey, man, my mom and dad are human and...

22:46.204 --> 22:50.416
If there's one thing you learn on this job,
it's that humans are capable of anything.

22:50.542 --> 22:53.460
A smudge of dirty tyre on a ratty piece of paper.

22:53.587 --> 22:55.579
I know. I know. It suck s.

22:55.714 --> 22:58.122
You couldn't get anything off of it, huh?

22:58.258 --> 23:01.343
Just because I'm a newbie
doesn't mean I'm not good.

23:01.470 --> 23:03.712
Your tyre print from the strip mall.

23:03.847 --> 23:05.222
Wow.

23:05.349 --> 23:07.555
Common to a lot of compacts
and sub-compacts.

23:07.684 --> 23:10.056
One manufacturer who uses it as standard -
Honda.

23:10.187 --> 23:13.770
So that confirms what Sara's eyewitness said.
What else you got?

23:13.899 --> 23:18.062
I've got incidental marks
from where the tyre ran over something.

23:18.195 --> 23:20.733
Left an impression.

23:22.699 --> 23:26.744
All you have to do is find the tyre
attached to the vehicle your shooter was driving.

23:26.870 --> 23:28.033
Thanks.

23:28.163 --> 23:31.864
OK.
Look at the bullet from your vic's thigh.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.037
Five lands and grooves on it.
That would be a Colt.

23:35.170 --> 23:36.913
.38 calibre.

23:37.047 --> 23:40.582
According to Vega, the vic owns a Colt.

23:40.717 --> 23:41.832
And?

23:41.969 --> 23:46.262
And... since he mysteriously got shot in the leg,
instead of a vital organ,

23:46.390 --> 23:48.429
I'm thinking I should go visit him.

23:48.558 --> 23:52.722
Mona Taylor didn't die from the beatings,
but cause of death was equally as slow.

23:52.854 --> 23:54.728
Asphyxia.

23:54.856 --> 23:57.810
- You look like you expected it.
- I considered it.

23:57.943 --> 24:01.775
There's something else.
She had some odd scarring

24:01.905 --> 24:03.779
on the inside of her nose.

24:03.907 --> 24:07.157
It's a small red circle

24:07.286 --> 24:09.777
She worked at a sex club.
Could be caused by anything.

24:09.913 --> 24:11.705
Like a straw?

24:11.832 --> 24:15.497
Maybe I lack imagination,
but why would you need a straw at a sex club?

24:15.627 --> 24:18.297
Well, it's not a sex club, actually. It's a fetish club.

24:18.380 --> 24:22.841
- There's a difference?
- Like a straw is not used for sipping mint juleps.

24:22.968 --> 24:26.419
- Cocaine?
- Air.

24:28.223 --> 24:30.430
Anything from last night would be in here.

24:30.559 --> 24:34.010
Masks. The usual accoutrements.

24:34.146 --> 24:38.440
- We don't technically have a warrant.
- Not necessary. I want to help.

24:48.160 --> 24:51.944
Go ahead. Ask. How can I do this for a living?

24:52.080 --> 24:54.750
Oh, that's not what I was thinking.

24:56.418 --> 25:00.498
- How much does this place clear a week?
- Ten grand.

25:00.631 --> 25:03.335
I'm not with the IRS.

25:03.467 --> 25:05.044
OK. Twenty.

25:07.679 --> 25:11.511
I don't make that in... three months.

25:11.642 --> 25:15.093
- Sex pays a lot better than death.
- Plus the outfits are cooler.

25:15.228 --> 25:19.226
I have this genius tailor.
Worked at The Desert Inn back in the day.

25:19.358 --> 25:22.027
I let him come in weekends
and play human ashtray.

25:22.152 --> 25:24.857
He designs for me and my girls. It's a fair trade.

25:24.988 --> 25:26.981
You got a good thing going here.

25:27.115 --> 25:30.899
The best part is, these guys think
getting slapped around and humiliated

25:31.036 --> 25:32.827
is their fantasy.

25:32.955 --> 25:35.446
- It's like I always tell my daughter.
- A daughter?

25:35.582 --> 25:38.868
- 18 this month. Freshman at Harvard.
- Really?

25:40.379 --> 25:44.211
- Mine's seven.
- Oh. That's a great age.

25:44.341 --> 25:46.749
When I thought
Zoe was ready to hear it, I told her,

25:46.885 --> 25:50.088
"Honey, there are a lot of things
you can give a man.

25:50.222 --> 25:52.713
Your body. Your time. Even your heart.

25:52.849 --> 25:57.262
But the one thing you can never,
ever, ever let go of is your power."

26:00.482 --> 26:04.480
All my mother ever said to me was,
"Cash upfront."

26:04.611 --> 26:09.606
Don't take this the wrong way, but you've got
everything it takes to make a great dominatrix.

26:09.741 --> 26:11.283
I take that as a compliment.

26:11.410 --> 26:14.529
Well, you should.
It's just about knowing yourself.

26:14.663 --> 26:16.656
Being strong.

26:16.790 --> 26:22.129
And not taking any crap from powerful jerks
who are used to giving it all day long.

26:22.212 --> 26:27.088
Well, death is still a man's business,
and I don't have to tell you about police work.

26:27.217 --> 26:28.759
So how do you survive?

26:30.429 --> 26:33.798
By knowing myself. And working hard.

26:33.932 --> 26:38.641
And by not taking any crap from powerful jerks
who are used to giving it all day long.

26:42.190 --> 26:46.734
These are the masks and straws
I took out of the sink at Lady Heather's.

26:46.862 --> 26:50.231
- None of which have been washed.
- Mona was a dominatrix at the club

26:50.449 --> 26:54.316
But my guess is that she was a switch
for her off-the-books clients.

26:54.453 --> 26:56.113
(Greg laughs)

26:56.246 --> 26:58.239
You know what a switch is?

26:58.373 --> 27:00.781
Someone who's dominant
as well as submissive.

27:00.917 --> 27:03.753
Oh, he's even got the lingo down.
(Makes whip-crack sound)

27:05.422 --> 27:08.127
If Mona's DNA is in one of these mask s,

27:08.258 --> 27:11.093
then she was the submissive
on the night she died.

27:11.219 --> 27:13.129
You're so dialled into this case,

27:13.263 --> 27:16.513
I bet you don't need me to tell you
which mask had her DNA.

27:16.642 --> 27:20.224
Yes, I do, Greg. I also need to know
which straws she used.

27:25.108 --> 27:27.943
Oh, nice! That's the idea, Greg.

27:28.070 --> 27:30.395
Two straws per mask.

27:36.495 --> 27:39.661
- You can't get any air through pens.
- Not much more through straws.

27:39.790 --> 27:42.494
And even less
if someone's finger's on the other end.

27:45.128 --> 27:48.332
I found the victim's DNA on this mask.

27:48.465 --> 27:53.672
And these two straws.
Red mark, victim. Blue mark...

27:53.804 --> 27:55.927
Our killer.

27:56.056 --> 27:58.132
Now we just need a suspect.

28:06.692 --> 28:09.728
You got the Yin. I got the Yang.

28:10.904 --> 28:14.071
Actually, I've got the Yang
and you've got the Yin.

28:14.199 --> 28:17.153
At least as far as our watch moulds go.

28:17.286 --> 28:19.029
So that's from her wrist

28:19.162 --> 28:21.914
No air bubbles. Good job.

28:22.040 --> 28:23.618
Thank you.

28:23.750 --> 28:25.826
Now we'll see how yours turns out.

28:27.337 --> 28:29.793
And from the trash can...

28:32.009 --> 28:34.001
Wow!

28:34.136 --> 28:37.302
Looks like there's a few carats
around that bezel.

28:37.431 --> 28:39.388
And the band.

28:39.516 --> 28:41.509
Major buck s.

28:43.729 --> 28:47.940
Oh, and Computer Graphics
keyed up this video system. Just hit it.

28:50.527 --> 28:52.520
Yin and Yang

28:52.654 --> 28:58.360
Top and bottom.
Definitely not a man's watch, but unique.

29:00.621 --> 29:02.613
I wonder who bought it

29:04.916 --> 29:06.909
You know any fine jewellers?

29:08.211 --> 29:10.418
You have my pants?

29:10.547 --> 29:13.548
I wake up, I look around,
I can't find my damn pants.

29:13.675 --> 29:17.175
You can't wear 'em out of here.
So, what, you want 'em as a souvenir?

29:17.304 --> 29:20.056
- I want my stuff.
- Why don't we talk about your pistol?

29:20.182 --> 29:23.348
- I have one gun.
- It wouldn't happen to be a Colt?

29:23.477 --> 29:25.600
It's on a shelf behind the cash register.

29:25.729 --> 29:28.185
Ay, mi hermano, I was so worried about you.

29:29.566 --> 29:33.611
Hey, don't worry.
The doctor said everything was gonna be OK.

29:35.155 --> 29:37.148
Burglary?

29:37.282 --> 29:39.275
In this neighbourhood?

29:39.409 --> 29:42.743
Are you missing any personal property?

29:42.871 --> 29:44.864
Jewellery? Small valuables?

29:44.998 --> 29:46.790
A watch, perhaps?

29:46.917 --> 29:49.372
No. My wife didn't mention anything either.

29:50.545 --> 29:55.042
Again! I'm sorry. I have to go change Dylan.

29:55.175 --> 29:56.883
Before you do, Mr Nelson,

29:57.010 --> 30:01.090
in the last year did you buy a diamond watch
at Maarten's Jewellers at the Forum Shops?

30:01.223 --> 30:02.598
Yeah.

30:02.724 --> 30:06.722
In my spare time between the grocery store,
the park and Baby Jamboree.

30:06.853 --> 30:09.807
No. This is my life. Sorry.

30:09.940 --> 30:12.609
Thanks for your help.

30:13.735 --> 30:17.187
Why do men
always make everything look so tough?

30:18.991 --> 30:22.027
If the dad didn't buy the watch,
then the mom did.

30:22.160 --> 30:24.153
Brass has the credit card receipt.

30:24.288 --> 30:26.825
A $20,000 watch and he didn't discuss it?

30:26.957 --> 30:28.949
He's lying.

30:29.084 --> 30:31.290
I thought my husband answered your questions.

30:31.420 --> 30:35.548
- He tried.
- Gustav Stickley. Very nice furniture.

30:35.674 --> 30:38.129
No pictures of your family, though.

30:38.260 --> 30:39.968
I know what they look like.

30:40.095 --> 30:42.668
Most people keep pictures of their loved ones.

30:42.806 --> 30:45.842
I would hope I'm not like most people.
Is there a point to this?

30:45.976 --> 30:50.804
Did you order a $20,000 custom-made watch
from a jeweller at the Forum Shops?

30:50.939 --> 30:55.019
- I did. Is there a problem?
- No. We'd just like to see it.

30:55.152 --> 30:57.524
- Do you have a warrant?
- Do we need one?

30:57.654 --> 30:59.647
The truth is, I lost it on a business trip.

30:59.781 --> 31:02.652
I'm waiting to find out from the hotel
if they found it.

31:02.784 --> 31:05.702
Is that the trip that you took to LA
with your boss Ronald?

31:05.829 --> 31:07.869
Let me refresh your memory.

31:07.998 --> 31:11.449
You shared a suite. Very cost-effective.

31:11.585 --> 31:13.577
What did you save there? $200-300?

31:16.089 --> 31:19.838
I'm a corporate litigator.
It takes more than that to rattle my cage.

31:22.930 --> 31:24.922
OK. How about this?

31:25.057 --> 31:29.469
Are you familiar with a gal
who calls herself Lady Heather?

31:29.603 --> 31:31.726
No.

31:31.855 --> 31:34.809
One of the girls who works for Lady Heather
was found dead

31:34.942 --> 31:37.896
with an imprint of your watch on her wrist.

31:38.028 --> 31:40.021
That's why we'd like a sample of your DNA.

31:40.155 --> 31:42.148
That's a big leap.

31:42.282 --> 31:46.327
Lost watch to a DNA request.
I think we're done here.

31:49.206 --> 31:52.409
- What do you know about the moneybag?
- Clean cut. Quick way in.

31:52.542 --> 31:55.247
Can you tell us anything
about the tool that was used?

31:55.379 --> 31:57.917
- BFK.
- Big knife. Great.

31:59.132 --> 32:00.924
Tell us something we don't know.

32:01.051 --> 32:03.091
I found materials on the cut.

32:03.220 --> 32:04.251
Nice.

32:08.141 --> 32:11.392
It's gotta be transfer from the knife.

32:11.520 --> 32:14.770
Red fibres. All uniform length.

32:14.898 --> 32:18.563
The refractive index of the fibres is 1.544.

32:18.694 --> 32:20.686
It's a synthetic. Fibreglass.

32:20.821 --> 32:23.394
- Like the insulation in my attic.
- Close.

32:23.532 --> 32:25.655
But those amber beads are catalysts.

32:25.784 --> 32:29.200
Resin which causes the fibreglass
to harden when poured into a mould.

32:29.329 --> 32:32.034
A mould? To make what?

32:37.170 --> 32:40.622
There's three fibreglass manufacturers
here in Vegas.

32:40.757 --> 32:44.802
This is the largest one
for prefab baths and showers. 24 employees.

32:44.928 --> 32:47.965
Everybody in the bath business
uses isophthalic resin.

32:48.098 --> 32:53.093
It has the highest water resistance. Downside
is the stuff gets everywhere. Hair, clothes, skin.

32:53.228 --> 32:55.102
Hey.

32:56.607 --> 32:58.765
Small world, huh?

33:00.277 --> 33:04.109
It's ironic, Hector. We're investigating
your brother-in-law's shooting

33:04.239 --> 33:05.983
and look where we end up.

33:06.116 --> 33:08.073
We found traces of resin

33:08.201 --> 33:10.443
and fibreglass on Santee's moneybag.

33:10.579 --> 33:12.655
So?

33:12.789 --> 33:16.834
So... how many knives in Vegas
come into contact with both those materials?

33:19.004 --> 33:20.582
Dame la navaja.

33:26.637 --> 33:28.380
Thanks.

33:30.974 --> 33:33.644
- It could be anyone's knife.
- And we have a tyre print.

33:35.771 --> 33:38.475
See? You got the wrong car.

33:38.607 --> 33:41.524
We never said what model we were looking for.

33:41.652 --> 33:44.688
We're looking for a Honda, Hector.
Do you have one?

33:44.821 --> 33:46.814
Because we can check your house.

33:46.949 --> 33:49.356
Why don't we just start in this parking lot?

34:00.587 --> 34:02.912
Hey, come down here!

34:04.091 --> 34:06.297
You know, it don't look good when you run, man.

34:06.426 --> 34:09.463
- You wanna tell us who the Honda belongs to?
- I don't know.

34:09.596 --> 34:12.348
OK, a friend of mine.
But he told me nobody would get hurt.

34:12.474 --> 34:14.965
I guess that makes everything OK.

34:16.603 --> 34:18.844
You again.

34:18.981 --> 34:21.139
I thought you would have gotten the message.

34:21.275 --> 34:24.690
Oh, we did. We also got a warrant.

34:28.364 --> 34:31.697
Is this some kind of joke?
This is limited to my watch box.

34:31.827 --> 34:33.819
Sometimes that's all it takes.

34:35.371 --> 34:38.741
- Eileen, honey, everything OK?
- Cameron, go see what Dylan needs.

34:41.920 --> 34:44.873
I think my watch box
is in my glove compartment.

34:45.007 --> 34:46.715
Is the watch in the box?

34:59.438 --> 35:01.430
Latex

35:01.565 --> 35:05.894
Like Hansel and Gretel, we just followed
the breadcrumbs all the way home.

35:16.413 --> 35:18.702
Afternoon tea How nice

35:19.833 --> 35:21.991
I like a bit of civility before dark,

35:22.127 --> 35:24.416
when all the needy little boys show up.

35:24.546 --> 35:26.539
I'm a little needy myself today.

35:26.673 --> 35:31.086
My lab pulled skin cells
from Mona Taylor's straws.

35:31.219 --> 35:32.762
DNA sample?

35:35.015 --> 35:38.633
I have several clients in law enforcement.
XX or X Y?

35:38.769 --> 35:40.808
They're male.

35:44.274 --> 35:47.145
Have you ever seen either of these two people?

35:47.277 --> 35:50.314
Not the wife, but I have seen the husband.

35:51.490 --> 35:55.108
- I didn't say they were married.
- It's obvious.

35:55.243 --> 35:58.992
He's clenching her hand with both of his
and leaning toward her.

35:59.122 --> 36:03.120
See now she's twisting away,
presenting herself to the wealthy alpha male

36:03.251 --> 36:05.209
She's insensitive. He's insecure.

36:05.337 --> 36:07.579
That's a setup for matrimony, not passion.

36:07.714 --> 36:10.501
She wants the dominant male to choose her

36:10.634 --> 36:12.673
so she can stop being dominant.

36:15.264 --> 36:18.134
You're very good. You could work for me.

36:18.267 --> 36:21.102
You wanna be my boss?

36:21.228 --> 36:23.220
You never know.

36:23.355 --> 36:26.439
We both might learn something.

36:26.566 --> 36:28.808
Oh, I'm sure of that.

36:32.322 --> 36:35.157
I can read anyone who comes here
and know their desires,

36:35.284 --> 36:37.525
sometimes even before they do.

36:37.661 --> 36:41.990
Why do you think I selected
china and table linens?

36:42.124 --> 36:44.828
You like fine things.

36:44.960 --> 36:47.332
Or maybe I knew you'd like them.

36:47.462 --> 36:52.836
The same way I know you enjoy
most of the superficial trappings of civilisation.

36:54.052 --> 36:56.294
I'm that obvious, huh?

36:56.430 --> 37:00.012
Only because you try not to be.
You spend your life uncovering

37:00.142 --> 37:03.926
what goes on beneath the surface
of civility and acceptable behaviour.

37:04.062 --> 37:08.142
So it's a release for you
to indulge in something like high tea,

37:08.275 --> 37:10.517
where it seems, if only for a moment,

37:10.652 --> 37:12.645
the world really is civilised.

37:16.658 --> 37:20.241
The most telling thing about anyone
is what scares them.

37:21.622 --> 37:25.156
And I know what you fear
more than anything, Mr Grissom.

37:26.335 --> 37:28.327
Which is?

37:28.462 --> 37:30.004
Being known.

37:31.423 --> 37:35.207
You can't accept
that I might know what you really desire

37:35.344 --> 37:37.383
because that would mean that I know you.

37:37.512 --> 37:41.890
Something, for whatever reason, you spend
your entire life making sure no-one else does.

37:45.812 --> 37:47.888
Lady Heather, you're an anthropologist.

37:49.024 --> 37:51.266
More tea?

37:55.489 --> 37:58.573
See, I could give the money back.
My wife doesn't even know.

37:58.700 --> 38:02.828
If I give the money back to her brother,
I could go home, right? Right?

38:04.373 --> 38:08.240
Tell us how it happened.
Then we'll talk about the future.

38:10.295 --> 38:12.869
When I picked Carla up from work
on Wednesday,

38:13.006 --> 38:16.506
I doubled back and I lifted the piece
that Santee keeps by the register.

38:16.635 --> 38:18.841
I figured I return it Friday. Nobody would know.

38:18.971 --> 38:20.762
Pretty smart, Hector.

38:20.889 --> 38:24.721
I couldn't use my car cos Santee knew it.
So I hit up on a buddy.

38:38.865 --> 38:42.910
Look, it's not like they're out of anything.
They're insured.

38:43.036 --> 38:45.871
For the money and his health. Nobody loses.

38:48.750 --> 38:50.743
So can I go now?

38:50.877 --> 38:52.420
Hector's my husband

38:52.546 --> 38:56.045
- But I hope you keep him in jail a long time!
- He's not going anywhere.

38:56.174 --> 38:58.500
You commit a crime, you pay the price.

38:58.635 --> 38:59.964
You got that right.

39:00.095 --> 39:04.804
By the way, we found the $5,000 you skimmed
from this business in your jeans pocket.

39:04.933 --> 39:07.009
What?!

39:14.401 --> 39:16.607
You self-righteous bastard!

39:16.737 --> 39:21.944
You stand there and bad-mouth my husband
while you're robbing me behind my back?

39:22.075 --> 39:25.076
I was just borrowing it, I swear.

39:25.203 --> 39:28.454
- You gonna arrest his ass?
- Yeah.

39:42.471 --> 39:45.555
They had a warrant.
I didn't wanna bother you at work.

39:46.767 --> 39:49.139
This qualifies as a harassment suit.

39:49.269 --> 39:50.763
Too late.

39:52.022 --> 39:54.430
- Grains of golden sand.
- What?

39:54.566 --> 39:58.149
Edgar Allan Poe.
Another man who was familiar with murder.

39:59.488 --> 40:01.943
Played in any sandboxes lately, Mr Nelson?

40:03.241 --> 40:07.286
As my husband's attorney,
I'm advising him not to speak with you.

40:07.412 --> 40:09.322
Eileen.

40:09.456 --> 40:11.365
Shut up, Cameron. I'll handle this.

40:13.377 --> 40:15.369
No.

40:16.546 --> 40:18.504
No, I will not shut up.

40:19.633 --> 40:23.298
I didn't ask you to be my attorney.
You're just looking out for yourself.

40:23.428 --> 40:26.133
I'm looking out for our family.
I'm the only one qualified.

40:26.265 --> 40:30.677
Really? How exactly is sleeping with Ronald
looking after your family?

40:30.811 --> 40:32.471
- Cameron!
- Cameron what?

40:35.023 --> 40:37.728
You never gave a damn about me
And our child

40:37.859 --> 40:41.394
Our child is some yuppie pet
designed to make you look better at the firm,

40:41.530 --> 40:44.235
which happens to be
the only family you care about.

40:44.366 --> 40:47.865
Mr Nelson, you're very emotional right now.
Just take a moment.

40:47.995 --> 40:50.320
Collect yourself. Let me get you a glass of water.

40:50.455 --> 40:52.578
No. No water. No gum. No anything.

40:52.708 --> 40:56.456
If you think you can trick him into
giving you some DNA, you're mistaken.

41:04.720 --> 41:06.712
Liquid latex.

41:09.433 --> 41:12.006
What is that supposed to mean?

41:12.144 --> 41:16.307
Your husband made Mona Taylor wear it
every time that he paid to humiliate her.

41:16.440 --> 41:18.397
Why would he do that?

41:18.525 --> 41:21.775
Psychologically, she was a surrogate.

41:21.903 --> 41:24.192
In fetish club terms she was a slave

41:25.907 --> 41:28.315
Cameron would put a mask on her face...

41:30.537 --> 41:33.075
...and cover her body in liquid latex.

41:45.510 --> 41:49.425
He made her into nothing,
in order to make her into you.

41:49.556 --> 41:52.427
- My watch.
- Well, I guess that made it more real.

41:52.559 --> 41:57.554
Cameron couldn't dominate you,
so he dominated Mona.

41:57.689 --> 42:01.734
Only, his last appointment,
he got carried away.

42:01.860 --> 42:06.439
You corporate bitch! You think you're too good
to touch your own husband?

42:06.573 --> 42:09.242
How about I make you beg for air? Huh?

42:09.326 --> 42:12.031
I make you beg for it!

42:13.497 --> 42:15.489
Go ahead.

42:15.624 --> 42:18.115
Are you begging for it? Huh?

42:18.251 --> 42:19.450
I can't hear you, Eileen.

42:30.472 --> 42:35.348
- I had to pay some girl to pretend to be my wife.
- Cameron, be quiet.

42:35.477 --> 42:38.680
If this is all that you have, I am...

42:40.899 --> 42:43.853
...happy to go to trial.

42:43.986 --> 42:46.986
Mrs Nelson,
we're gonna match Cameron's epithelials

42:47.114 --> 42:49.106
to the ones on the end of the straws.

42:49.241 --> 42:53.285
Wait, wait. Epithelials.
That's like DNA, right? That's DNA?

42:53.412 --> 42:59.035
OK. I got an idea.
Why don't we test little Dylan's epithelials?

42:59.167 --> 43:01.623
See if his daddy isn't really your law partner.

43:01.753 --> 43:05.336
Cos God knows,
you haven't let me touch you in three years.

43:08.510 --> 43:11.546
- I'm outta here.
- Where are you going?

43:11.680 --> 43:13.589
Away from you.

43:13.724 --> 43:15.763
Other than that, I really don't care.

43:28.655 --> 43:32.404
I just realised that you and I
have a very healthy relationship.

43:32.534 --> 43:34.112
We do?

43:34.244 --> 43:39.036
When we have a problem, I don't paint Greg
Sanders in latex and stick a straw up his nose.

43:39.166 --> 43:40.909
Good. He'd probably like it.

43:41.043 --> 43:43.035
Gil,

43:43.170 --> 43:46.586
you're supposed to say
something revealing back to me.

43:46.715 --> 43:48.708
OK.

43:48.842 --> 43:51.380
I never told anybody this, Catherine...

43:52.305 --> 43:58.414
