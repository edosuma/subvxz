Have you come to kill me?

What are you doing, Pete?

17:25.670 --> 17:27.464
I don't know, man.
I'm really fuckin' confused.

17:27.505 --> 17:29.382

and have a little chat

You know how triggering

- Look, Pete.

17:43.521 --> 17:44.856
I thought you would have
figured this out by now,

17:44.898 --> 17:46.358

getting through to you.

Pete?

17:56.785 --> 17:59.162
That tells me that you're
not doing very good at all.

17:59.204 --> 18:01.498
I mean, Pete, this is just
my way of tracking you,

18:01.539 --> 18:02.791

18:42.956 --> 18:44.791
a lot to talk about
on Thursday, pal.

18:44.833 --> 18:46.710

18:57.262 --> 18:58.513
Oh, Pete, I get it, okay?

18:58.555 --> 19:00.348
You're frustrated.
This is a lot to process.

19:00.390 --> 19:01.891
So--uh, all right.

19:01.933 --> 19:04.728
Well, I will pencil you in

- Okay, Pete,

19:13.945 --> 19:15.238
- is this about the photo?
- Yes!

19:15.280 --> 19:16.906
Okay, I'll take
the stupid photo down, okay,
