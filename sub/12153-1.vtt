What? Because we're

most of the evil in the world...

has given us its L.A. branch
to run however we want...

04:36.500 --> 04:38.800

divide or destroy us...

Don't you think it's a bit unseemly
adding Y's to the ends of people's names?

Does that mean I have to
call you ''Wesle''?

05:45.800 --> 05:47.800

- Oh.

05:47.800 --> 05:49.700
I want the one on the left.

05:49.700 --> 05:53.700

completely out of place. I'd say 1 7% less.

05:53.700 --> 05:57.300
Plus-- Little bit of a view
of the mountains.

05:57.300 --> 06:00.100

06:04.300 --> 06:07.800
We could switch if you don't like the--
you know, the kung pao or whatever.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.900
- Feng shui.
- Right. What's that mean again?

06:09.900 --> 06:12.800
That people
will believe anything.

06:12.800 --> 06:15.900
Actually, in this place, feng shui
will probably have enormous significance.

06:15.900 --> 06:17.800
I'll align my furniture
the wrong way...

06:17.800 --> 06:19.900

You got the mystical creds
at least. I just hit stuff.

turn this place around, use it to do some good...

06:31.500 --> 06:35.100

Yeah, you're a shoo-in. The part's yours.

06:50.700 --> 06:54.600

I was workin' the town, helpin' the helpless--
the thing I like to do--

07:15.300 --> 07:18.000
- and the entire firm shows up in the alley.
- We'll make sure...

07:18.000 --> 07:20.400
- it doesn't happen again.
- We're turning this place inside out.

07:20.400 --> 07:23.800
They want to see how I handle
running Wolfram and Hart, they're gonna find out.

to see you guys.

Never happen again.

You always open both doors
when you enter a room?

<i>I don't need to make an entrance.</i>
<i>I need to make an impression.</i>

07:50.900 --> 07:53.100

- Who do you answer to?
- The senior partners.

08:08.100 --> 08:11.300
<i>And if you're thinking--</i>
<i>which by the way,you are--</i>

08:11.300 --> 08:14.100
<i>that you can use me to get to them,</i>
<i>let go of the dream.</i>

08:14.100 --> 08:16.300

I don't lunch with them.

<i>Still, a pretty powerful</i>
<i>position for a young woman.</i>

08:19.800 --> 08:22.800
How exactly can you be sure
I'm either of those things?

08:24.700 --> 08:26.600
Okay, let me tell you
how this works.

08:26.600 --> 08:28.500
<i>I thought I was in charge.</i>

08:28.500 --> 08:32.200
Of the Los Angeles offices
of a multidimensional corporation.

08:32.200 --> 08:34.900
Now, I'm stressing that last word
because that's what we are.

08:34.900 --> 08:37.600
<i>We're a business,</i>
<i>and we have a bottom line.</i>

08:37.600 --> 08:41.500
Now, you could take your new client list
and start hacking away from the top down.

08:41.500 --> 08:45.300
<i>A lot of our clients are demons,</i>
<i>and almost all of them are evil.</i>

08:45.600 --> 08:47.100
Almost?

08:48.700 --> 08:51.900
Things are always more complicated
than they seem, champ.

08:51.900 --> 08:54.600
You could shut this place down...

08:54.600 --> 08:57.200
but then--

08:57.200 --> 09:00.200
Well, then-- then you wouldn't
have it anymore.

09:00.200 --> 09:04.900
The place closes down.
The connections dry up. Evil goes next door.

09:07.500 --> 09:09.400
This is the catch.

09:09.400 --> 09:13.200
I'm explaining the catch so you don't have to
stand around wondering what it is.

09:13.200 --> 09:15.400
See, in order to
keep this business running...

09:15.400 --> 09:18.100
you have to
keep this business running.

09:18.100 --> 09:21.700
And that means keeping your clients--
most of them anyway-- happy.

09:21.700 --> 09:23.800
<i>It means lettin' 'em</i>
<i>get away with stuff.</i>

09:23.800 --> 09:27.600
Sweetie, they were getting away with it
while you were all sitting around your hotel...

09:27.600 --> 09:30.000

09:30.000 --> 09:32.600
You're on the ins now,
and you can stop the worst of it.

09:32.600 --> 09:36.100
Maybe find some new solutions
to some old problems.

09:38.200 --> 09:40.600
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>Isn't anybody excited?</i>

09:41.500 --> 09:43.900
This is a crazy time of fun.

09:43.900 --> 09:49.300
The most powerful evil around has given
a pivotal position over to its sworn enemies.

09:51.400 --> 09:53.900
You're not scared, are you?

09:59.900 --> 10:02.100
Your client files
are all in there.

10:02.100 --> 10:04.300
Might want to start
going through 'em.

10:09.700 --> 10:11.700
[ Angel ]
This is unbelievable.

10:11.700 --> 10:14.100
I think I've lost
my appetite.

10:14.100 --> 10:17.200
Which is kind of a first.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.400
Hmm. Well, this is
interesting.

10:19.400 --> 10:22.900
Apparently old Joe Kennedy tried to
get out of his deal with the firm.

10:22.900 --> 10:24.300
That explains a lot.

10:24.300 --> 10:26.600
<i>Yeah, but George Sr.,</i>

<i>There's no one these guys</i>
<i>don't have a piece of.</i>

10:29.800 --> 10:32.600

10:32.600 --> 10:34.800
<i>Here's a winner.</i>

10:34.800 --> 10:38.400
On trial for smuggling Asian girls in

Been charged with drugs, gunrunnin'.
Nothin' stuck.

Hmm. First good news all day.

10:47.700 --> 10:49.700
I can't even remember
which pile is which.

10:49.700 --> 10:52.600
I'll get my secretary

<i>My impression is a lot of these guys arejust</i>
<i>opportunistic. They'll go with the flow.</i>

11:02.200 --> 11:04.800
You know we're gonna have to
check the whole staff...

11:04.800 --> 11:07.600
make sure we don't have
any die-hard evildoers plotting against us.

11:08.800 --> 11:11.000
And here I was worrying
about the clients.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.400
We're doing the right thing.

And furthermore,
the strain on my client's several businesses...

37:19.300 --> 37:22.100
has forced Oriental Bay Exports
to shrink its holdings of late.

If Mr. Fries is convicted,
the interest Your Honor has in it...

a controlling interest.

I would prefer not to present
the rest of our findings in front of the jury.

37:34.800 --> 37:38.100
I'll see counsel
in my chambers-- right now.

<i>I'm honestly beginning to suspect...</i>

38:13.000 --> 38:14.900
that you're not
part of the solution.

Conviction.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.400

more powerful than conviction.

Charles agreed to let us enhance his mind
with a comprehensive knowledge of the law.

- Without asking us?
- Mother, may I?

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
- Without telling us?
- 'Cause I knew you guys would freak. It's me here.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.500
They didn't evil me up.
All I got stuck in my head was the law.

39:36.500 --> 39:39.400
And for some reason
a mess-load of Gilbert and Sullivan.

39:39.400 --> 39:43.200
- Standard. Great for elocution.
- How can you possibly know
they didn't do anything else?

39:43.200 --> 39:45.200
'Cause I saw the man
in the White Room.

39:45.200 --> 39:47.700
He does a lot of scary things,
but lying ain't one of'em.

39:47.700 --> 39:50.000
You needed a lawyer
to get by here.

Charles had
the most unused potential.

39:52.100 --> 39:55.700
His degrees are all forged,
