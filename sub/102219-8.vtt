[video game music playing on Game Boy]

00:17.517 --> 00:19.310
Can't do the eyes.

00:27.193 --> 00:28.069
Dope.

00:28.153 --> 00:29.612
You'll get it, brother.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.156
-[timer dings]
-Cousin.

00:32.782 --> 00:34.284
[Rosa sighs] Oh…

00:35.076 --> 00:37.454
For the love of God.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.831
What's older? Me or this oven?

00:40.707 --> 00:41.791
Don't answer that.

00:42.417 --> 00:44.669
Nice and hot. Here you go.

00:45.670 --> 00:46.921
[chuckles]

00:48.965 --> 00:51.134
-What's that face?
-Tastes nasty.

00:54.804 --> 00:55.805
[groans]

00:56.890 --> 00:58.099
Bad eggs.

00:58.975 --> 00:59.851
Try it.

01:01.102 --> 01:02.270
Hell no.

01:03.354 --> 01:06.566
A rotten one can ruin the whole bunch.

01:08.068 --> 01:08.902
Hmm.

01:10.987 --> 01:12.405
-Just put it in?
-Mmm-hmm.

01:12.489 --> 01:14.699
If they sink, they're good.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.079
Better to catch it now.

01:19.162 --> 01:21.581
Okay, now
we have to start all over. [sighs]

01:21.664 --> 01:25.585
Now, where is
that baking powder? Here we go.

01:25.668 --> 01:29.589
Vanilla, brown sugar, flour.
Who wants to help?

01:29.672 --> 01:31.341
[pop music playing over speakers]

01:34.594 --> 01:36.304
You and me,

01:36.387 --> 01:38.723
we got a real opportunity here.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.268
What am I supposed to tell them?

01:42.352 --> 01:44.229
Just keep 'em busy.

01:45.522 --> 01:49.150
The people who live
in a surveillance van outside of my house?

01:49.234 --> 01:51.277
Yeah, them. They don't trust you?

01:52.821 --> 01:54.239
I've given them nothing.

01:55.406 --> 01:57.283
Well, you better give them something.

01:59.786 --> 02:02.914
-They're gonna see right through it.
-Not if you play it smart.

02:05.542 --> 02:06.751
I'll end up in jail.

02:08.545 --> 02:09.754
I'm not asking you.

02:11.422 --> 02:12.841
Well, I'm not doing it.

02:18.179 --> 02:19.305
[chuckles]

02:19.389 --> 02:20.390
[scoffs]

02:21.850 --> 02:24.310
You know there's worse
places to end up, right?

02:27.355 --> 02:29.107
I thought you needed me.

02:30.024 --> 02:30.942
I do.

02:31.526 --> 02:33.069
Well, there you go.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.612
But not your family.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.160
You feel me?

02:42.537 --> 02:45.874
Keep your head up, champ.
You're playing the long game here.

02:48.543 --> 02:49.627
[door closes]

02:53.172 --> 02:56.050
You guys. Say something, anything.

02:58.761 --> 03:01.306
Who exactly do we work for now?

03:02.223 --> 03:03.933
You mean who <i>don't</i> we work for.

03:04.017 --> 03:06.769
See, that's the part
I'm having a problem with.

03:06.853 --> 03:08.605
And why does he have us printing?

03:08.688 --> 03:10.023
I don't know.

03:10.607 --> 03:12.025
[Ruby] What's it for?

03:12.108 --> 03:13.359
It didn't come up.

03:15.361 --> 03:16.529
[chuckles]

03:16.613 --> 03:19.699
How are we supposed
to keep it secret from the Secret Service?

03:25.079 --> 03:25.997
[sighs]

03:26.080 --> 03:28.333
-Let's just pack it up.
-[scoffs] Yeah, right.

03:28.917 --> 03:30.919
Did you figure out where his money goes?

03:31.002 --> 03:33.630
-Not Mediterranean Avenue.
-Not anywhere.

03:35.048 --> 03:38.551
DC is not going
to keep the tab going much longer.

03:42.138 --> 03:43.514
They'll take our deal away.

03:43.598 --> 03:45.350
You know what he'll take away?

03:45.433 --> 03:47.644
[scoffs] Like we have
anything left to lose.

03:47.727 --> 03:48.561
Our kids.

03:51.981 --> 03:53.900
What if she's protecting him?

03:54.484 --> 03:56.653
She can't think we're that stupid.

03:56.736 --> 03:58.947
She's not thinking with her brain.

04:00.281 --> 04:02.951
-He is pretty hot.
-Stupid hot.

04:05.745 --> 04:08.039
So, we're back to where we started.

04:09.958 --> 04:11.626
The man's like IBS.

04:11.709 --> 04:12.919
Ain't no cure.

04:13.962 --> 04:15.588
You never know when it's gonna strike.

04:22.470 --> 04:25.640
Well, now she thinks
another baby is gonna fix everything.

04:25.723 --> 04:26.933
[man] First three didn't.

04:27.016 --> 04:28.184
I got four.

04:28.935 --> 04:33.314
I told her, I said, "Honey, the time I
spend on the saddle, the sac is cashed."

04:33.398 --> 04:35.733
[chuckles] Wait, is that…
Is that really a thing?

04:35.817 --> 04:36.985
[scoffs] It's a perk.

04:37.068 --> 04:38.361
[all chuckle]

04:40.947 --> 04:42.115
What was it like?

04:42.198 --> 04:43.241
Oh…

04:45.201 --> 04:46.494
This?

04:46.577 --> 04:48.288
-Big house.
-[Dean] Yeah.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.540
It's kind of a party.

04:50.623 --> 04:52.500
-Come on, man.
-[Dean] No, seriously.

04:52.583 --> 04:55.753
Food wasn't that bad.
I got to work out all the time.

04:55.837 --> 04:57.338
Plus, I had my own cell, so…

04:57.422 --> 04:58.506
How'd you swing that?

04:59.674 --> 05:02.760
My first cellie tried to steal my ramen.

05:02.844 --> 05:04.971
So I beat him within an inch of his life.

05:05.054 --> 05:06.472
Over ramen?

05:08.308 --> 05:09.892
Took his nose off.

05:11.769 --> 05:12.854
With my teeth.

05:14.731 --> 05:15.982
[laughs]

05:16.065 --> 05:17.859
Jesus!

05:17.942 --> 05:20.486
[Dean] I'm just busting
your cashed sac, bud.

05:20.570 --> 05:21.529
[all laughing]

05:21.612 --> 05:23.823
-You wanna know what it's really like?
-[Vance] Yes.

05:23.906 --> 05:27.994
It's kinda like, um…
being in an elephant exhibit at the zoo.

05:28.077 --> 05:28.995
[Cory] Dude.

05:29.078 --> 05:31.831
[Dean] And all the other elephants
think you are their wife.

05:31.914 --> 05:32.790
Dude.

05:32.874 --> 05:34.542
-And it's your honeymoon.
-[Cory] Dude.

05:34.625 --> 05:37.545
And they won't stop
until they put a baby in you. [laughs]

05:42.216 --> 05:43.176
[Dean] I'm kidding!

05:43.259 --> 05:46.554
-I'm not believing a word from this guy.
-Look, I did sell cars.

05:46.637 --> 05:48.473
Yeah, he can sell bottled water to fish.

05:48.556 --> 05:50.183
I also sold hot tubs.

05:53.853 --> 05:56.147
Dean, how do you feel
about men's skincare?

05:56.898 --> 05:58.191
Uh…

05:58.274 --> 06:00.068
-Neutral.
-[Cory] Mmm. Well…

06:00.151 --> 06:02.320
-We about to change that for you, buddy.
-Hmm.

06:02.403 --> 06:04.489
You ever heard of "the system"?

06:04.572 --> 06:07.700
That's like a pyramid thing, right?

06:07.784 --> 06:10.953
No. More like a multi-level opportunity.

06:11.621 --> 06:15.374
-I mean, skincare is not really my jam.
-It's not really about that.

06:15.458 --> 06:18.920
There's a good chance I'm probably
going back to the elephant exhibit.

06:19.003 --> 06:20.963
That's exactly why you need the system.

06:21.047 --> 06:23.466
Right. And you don't just
get a bunch of products,

06:24.258 --> 06:25.802
you get a support network.

06:32.058 --> 06:33.559
Well, that sounds good.

06:34.393 --> 06:37.688
Cool. Just, you know,
let me put a think on it, you know.

06:37.772 --> 06:38.731
[Vance] Mmm-hmm.

06:39.732 --> 06:41.818
All the time you need.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.903
Hey, we're not just
into you for your skin.

06:47.365 --> 06:48.324
[cell phone dings]

06:50.284 --> 06:51.202
Tina's ovulating.

06:51.285 --> 06:53.371
-Oh…
-Let's get back on the road, yeah?

06:53.454 --> 06:54.914
It's go-time.

07:03.756 --> 07:06.134
When you get out of bed in the morning,

07:06.801 --> 07:08.386
and throw your uniform on,

07:09.512 --> 07:11.389
what do you expect out of your day?

07:12.223 --> 07:16.853
I mean, a livin' wage? Maybe.
A reasonable amount of breaks? Okay.

07:17.895 --> 07:21.858
But what does any of that mean
if you don't have respect?

07:23.693 --> 07:26.487
-Like when the customers get handsy?
-[Stan] Sure.

07:26.571 --> 07:28.156
Yeah, that's a part of that.

07:28.239 --> 07:30.867
But we get tipped way more
when we let that happen.

07:30.950 --> 07:31.868
[woman 1] She's right.

07:31.951 --> 07:36.205
Yeah, I'm thinkin' more about
how you're valued as an employee.

07:36.873 --> 07:38.374
You guys got a health plan?

07:40.585 --> 07:43.254
-Dental?
-No.

07:44.213 --> 07:46.841
What about paid sick leave?
How about day care?

07:46.924 --> 07:48.509
You know we got none of that.

07:48.593 --> 07:52.138
Well, these are the investments
that an employer should make.

07:52.221 --> 07:53.514
Why?

07:53.598 --> 07:58.769
'Cause you are crucial
to the success of this company. Right?

07:58.853 --> 08:00.188
[women agreeing]

08:00.271 --> 08:03.691
[Stan] I mean,
picture a McDonald's without a Ronald.

08:03.774 --> 08:07.236
Imagine green beans
without the Jolly Green Giant.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.031
Charles Schwab without Mr. Schwab.

08:10.114 --> 08:12.617
Exactly. Okay.
You are the face of this business.

08:12.700 --> 08:14.619
No one's looking at our faces.

08:14.702 --> 08:17.830
-And what does Gene give you in return?
-Ten percent of our tips.

08:17.914 --> 08:19.165
That's not day care.

08:19.248 --> 08:22.043
Well, we can take home
the extra food from the private parties.

08:22.126 --> 08:23.836
Not paid sick leave. Not dental.

08:23.920 --> 08:24.962
It ain't.

08:25.046 --> 08:26.464
He's not wrong.

08:26.547 --> 08:29.759
And definitely not respect.

08:29.842 --> 08:31.469
[woman 1] Yeah, Stan's right.

08:31.552 --> 08:33.012
-We deserve it.
-Yeah.

08:33.095 --> 08:34.889
-Screw that guy.
-[woman 2] Mmm-mmm.

08:34.972 --> 08:36.682
He lies,

08:36.766 --> 08:40.937
he cheats, he takes better care
of these poles than he does any of you.

08:41.020 --> 08:44.607
-[woman 3] He's right. That's messed up.
-[woman 4] We deserve better.

08:45.650 --> 08:46.943
Enough.

08:47.026 --> 08:49.737
-So, what do you want us to do, Stanimal?
-Yeah.

08:53.533 --> 08:56.744
How do you strip
without taking any clothes off?

08:57.328 --> 08:58.412
You don't.

08:59.956 --> 09:01.999
But people come to see the booty.

09:02.583 --> 09:03.584
That's my point.

09:04.669 --> 09:06.295
[chuckles] So they won't come.

09:06.379 --> 09:07.588
Now you're gettin' it.

09:10.508 --> 09:14.095
Okay, well, that's one of
the dumbest things I've ever heard.

09:14.178 --> 09:16.597
[Stan snickers] Okay, look.

09:18.182 --> 09:20.685
Gene doesn't have a club
without the girls, right?

09:20.768 --> 09:23.271
So eventually he'll have
to come to me to negotiate.

09:23.354 --> 09:26.524
Or he just
sacks all of you and starts over.

09:26.607 --> 09:28.859
Then we do a sit-in. Old-school style.

09:28.943 --> 09:31.445
-Handcuff ourselves to the stage.
-I take it back.

09:31.529 --> 09:34.448
-Force his hand.
<i>-That's</i> the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.663
Yeah, that's what
the girls said, too. [sighs]

09:43.749 --> 09:45.126
[hot tub whirring]

09:45.209 --> 09:46.877
[Emma] Hey, that's mine.

09:46.961 --> 09:48.963
-[Danny] Let go!
-[Emma] I had it first!

09:49.046 --> 09:50.381
[Danny] You can't go in my room.

09:50.464 --> 09:51.966
[Emma] Mom says you have to share.

09:52.049 --> 09:53.759
[Dean] Hey, let Danny have it.

09:53.843 --> 09:55.928
[Emma] He wants it
'cause I was playing with it.

09:56.012 --> 09:57.263
[Dean] Give it to your sister.

09:57.346 --> 09:59.098
[Danny] You gave it to me for my birthday.

09:59.181 --> 10:01.559
-[Dean] Like, three years ago.
-[Emma grunts] Ow!

10:01.642 --> 10:03.436
A little help here would be nice.

10:04.562 --> 10:07.273
This one's better. The legs bend.

10:08.566 --> 10:09.942
[Emma] Let me see.

10:11.736 --> 10:13.029
That one's busted.

10:13.112 --> 10:14.405
It'll keep her busy.

10:17.867 --> 10:20.911
Should we be mad or impressed?

10:28.794 --> 10:32.256
-[Ruby] How do you always lose your key?
-What do you care? It's never locked.

10:32.340 --> 10:33.341
It's always locked.

10:33.424 --> 10:35.468
Hasn't been
the last ten times we've come here.

10:35.551 --> 10:37.011
Because I always have my key.

10:38.846 --> 10:40.473
Yo, I thought we finished his run.

10:41.182 --> 10:42.850
This one's not for him.

10:43.809 --> 10:46.312
Know what time
I have to be at the salon tomorrow?

10:46.395 --> 10:48.397
So he's the toy they want, right?

10:49.357 --> 10:50.733
You're gonna be late.

10:50.816 --> 10:52.985
But we can't give them the toy they want.

10:53.069 --> 10:54.654
I should text my boss.

10:54.737 --> 10:56.781
So we're gonna give them the broken toy.

10:58.324 --> 10:59.950
The hell you talkin' about?

11:00.034 --> 11:01.285
I literally just told you.

11:01.369 --> 11:03.871
-Not in English.
-[Beth] Okay.

11:03.954 --> 11:07.041
The broken toy's gonna
keep them busy over here,

11:07.124 --> 11:10.211
while the good toy
can go off and do God knows what.

11:13.089 --> 11:15.049
-I'll just call in sick.
-I would.

11:17.510 --> 11:20.763
So, what you're saying is
we're basically framing someone.

11:20.846 --> 11:22.014
Yes.

11:22.098 --> 11:24.225
But… who?

11:25.017 --> 11:27.311
Oh, my God, that is the best part.

11:28.229 --> 11:29.522
Because it's…

11:31.607 --> 11:33.317
[rap song playing over speakers]

11:36.904 --> 11:38.781
-There it is!
-[breathing heavily]

11:38.864 --> 11:40.491
Fast hands!

11:40.574 --> 11:41.617
[grunts]

11:41.700 --> 11:43.160
Come on! Jab.

11:45.579 --> 11:46.539
[grunts]

11:46.622 --> 11:48.165
Keep your chin down. Jab.

11:48.749 --> 11:51.168
[man] Son of a gun.

11:53.796 --> 11:55.506
Oh. That's good.

11:56.715 --> 11:58.300
My buddy might disagree.

11:59.510 --> 12:00.886
[indistinct chatter]

12:08.394 --> 12:09.562
Now he won't.

12:11.856 --> 12:13.399
[trainer] Good, good!

12:13.482 --> 12:17.111
With the hook. Right there.
Come on! Come on! [grunts]

12:18.112 --> 12:19.029
One more.

12:19.113 --> 12:21.615
All right. Good work.

12:24.618 --> 12:25.828
[man] Yo, Champ.

12:26.412 --> 12:27.580
Your cousin.

12:36.088 --> 12:37.756
Hurry up. He doesn't seem happy.

12:39.467 --> 12:41.051
[men grunting indistinctly]

12:53.606 --> 12:54.773
Don't be pissed.

12:56.025 --> 12:56.901
[sighs]

12:57.568 --> 13:00.196
-I can't keep covering for you, Champ.
-[man] Nick?

13:05.534 --> 13:07.411
This… This is too much.

13:07.495 --> 13:08.913
For making me look good.

13:09.580 --> 13:10.456
[chuckles]

13:11.373 --> 13:14.210
-You played a great round, sir.
-Thanks to you.

13:21.967 --> 13:24.220
You got your head in the wrong game.

13:24.303 --> 13:25.888
[engine starts]

13:34.980 --> 13:36.440
[dryer running]

13:48.827 --> 13:50.162
[beeps]

14:19.650 --> 14:20.901
[knock on door]

14:25.573 --> 14:26.740
[Nick] Look familiar?

14:30.119 --> 14:32.246
-I wondered where I left that.
-Yeah.

14:32.329 --> 14:35.499
-I was gonna keep it, but…
-It's not your style.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.668
-You look better in it.
-[chuckles]

14:38.419 --> 14:39.545
Thank you. [chuckles]

14:41.755 --> 14:42.631
Um…

14:43.340 --> 14:44.592
Do you have a minute?

14:46.427 --> 14:47.970
[Beth] I have this coconut milk.

14:48.053 --> 14:51.015
I had a coupon
so I thought I'd try it or just…

14:51.098 --> 14:53.601
-So what's the deal?
-…plain cream.

14:53.684 --> 14:55.728
With you and him?

14:58.522 --> 14:59.648
What do you mean?

15:02.610 --> 15:05.321
Well, you're just
not his typical colleague.

15:08.365 --> 15:11.368
Well, maybe we're… more friends.

15:12.453 --> 15:14.413
Not his typical friend.

15:15.205 --> 15:16.582
You don't even know me.

15:18.375 --> 15:19.251
[sighs]

15:20.002 --> 15:23.255
[clicks tongue] I just think
that you should be careful.

15:26.508 --> 15:30.304
Hey, anyone who wears a cardigan
shouldn't be doing what he does.

15:30.888 --> 15:32.306
[chuckling] What are you, a priest?

15:32.389 --> 15:33.515
[laughs]

15:35.225 --> 15:36.769
Just trying to help.

15:37.394 --> 15:38.771
I'm fine.

15:38.854 --> 15:39.772
Uh…

15:40.356 --> 15:41.231
Look…

15:48.238 --> 15:52.076
Tell your neighbors. And hold on to that.

15:52.660 --> 15:56.163
You could've just given it
to your brother-cousin or whatever.

15:56.246 --> 15:59.291
Why? Do you wish it was him?

16:00.292 --> 16:01.418
No.

16:01.502 --> 16:02.628
Good.

16:03.212 --> 16:06.006
Which is it, by the way?
Brother or cousin?

16:08.926 --> 16:09.969
Family.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.017
And thanks for the coffee.

16:17.851 --> 16:19.645
I kind of like coconut milk.

16:19.728 --> 16:20.980
[door opens]

16:22.731 --> 16:23.732
[door closes]

16:37.287 --> 16:39.123
[scoffs] What's this?

16:40.833 --> 16:41.875
An offer.

16:47.381 --> 16:48.590
How tall are you?

16:51.760 --> 16:52.970
Five-two-ish.

16:54.388 --> 16:56.015
With or without heels?

16:56.974 --> 16:57.808
Uh…

16:57.891 --> 17:00.060
-[Gene] You ever compete?
-For what?

17:00.144 --> 17:01.979
Well, she looks like a gymnast.

17:04.481 --> 17:06.150
You know Gabby Douglas?

17:08.027 --> 17:09.903
-The Flying Squirrel.
-Yeah.

17:09.987 --> 17:13.115
-Does she work here?
-No. Uneven bars. She won.

17:14.074 --> 17:15.534
Can you touch your toes?

17:16.535 --> 17:17.453
Yeah.

17:17.536 --> 17:19.455
-How about the splits?
-[Beth bangs on table]

17:19.538 --> 17:21.457
We're trying to do some business here.

17:24.460 --> 17:26.628
I wanna pay off Stan's debt.

17:29.089 --> 17:30.257
Mercedes.

17:31.258 --> 17:33.093
Throw this in the microwave, would ya?

17:33.177 --> 17:35.721
-How long?
-[Gene] Baked potato. Thirty seconds.

17:43.729 --> 17:44.980
Looks like a fair amount.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.732
Twice as much as he owes you.

17:47.524 --> 17:48.984
Must really be worth it.

17:49.693 --> 17:50.903
The best.

17:50.986 --> 17:52.321
The greatest.

17:52.404 --> 17:53.614
I agree.

17:55.532 --> 17:57.201
Great. We have a deal.

18:03.749 --> 18:04.666
No.

18:05.667 --> 18:07.294
Can't replace the greatest.

18:09.963 --> 18:11.799
Fine. What's your number?

18:12.758 --> 18:14.718
-It's not possible.
-Triple?

18:15.302 --> 18:18.388
-Serious flex.
-Like your Flying Squirrel.

18:18.472 --> 18:19.807
Quadruple?

18:19.890 --> 18:21.391
Got dolla', dolla' bills.

18:22.684 --> 18:26.772
Where'd a bunch of bitches like you
get a bunch of money like this, though?

18:26.855 --> 18:28.774
Oh, now you've got a moral code?

18:29.608 --> 18:32.528
I just don't do business
with bitches, that's all.

18:34.696 --> 18:36.657
I'll take it upstairs, baby doll.

18:37.366 --> 18:38.826
Auditions are Sunday.

18:43.247 --> 18:44.998
[Beth] <i>That guy is a giant turd.</i>

18:48.460 --> 18:49.336
What?

18:49.419 --> 18:52.381
Nothing. I just have never heard you
say the word "turd" before.

18:52.464 --> 18:53.799
Well, he is.

18:53.882 --> 18:56.051
-Way more than that.
-He's a giant piece of--

18:56.135 --> 18:58.137
Do you think he knew the money was fake?

18:58.720 --> 19:01.515
That turd just gets off
on keeping a good man down.

19:04.768 --> 19:05.978
[Beth] Okay.

19:06.061 --> 19:10.399
So we break into his car
and we load up the trunk.

19:11.567 --> 19:13.527
How does that get it in the club?

19:15.070 --> 19:18.615
Well, he parks it
right outside in his spot.

19:18.699 --> 19:21.952
Then Rizzoli and Isles
know it's a setup 'cause of the LoJack.

19:22.035 --> 19:23.120
Ladies.

19:24.037 --> 19:27.916
What if we just mailed a box
of fake dough to the club?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.042
[Annie] Ladies?

19:29.126 --> 19:32.254
No, 'cause then we'll get busted
for mail fraud on top of everything else.

19:32.337 --> 19:33.714
Ladies!

19:34.756 --> 19:36.592
Occam's razor.

19:36.675 --> 19:37.926
What?

19:39.011 --> 19:40.804
The problem-solving principle

19:40.888 --> 19:44.349
that says entities shouldn't be
multiplied without necessity. Come on.

19:48.812 --> 19:51.023
She gets her GED
and now she's Stephen Hawking?

19:52.566 --> 19:56.111
Sometimes, the simplest way

19:56.195 --> 19:57.487
is the right way.

19:57.571 --> 19:58.780
["Megatron" playing]

20:45.285 --> 20:46.536
[imperceptible]

21:32.541 --> 21:34.418
[hip-hop song playing over speakers]

21:38.922 --> 21:40.674
[Dave] What is going on here?

21:43.468 --> 21:44.594
Eggs and legs.

21:44.678 --> 21:47.222
Carving station's legit.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.728
You said you wanted to know where it goes.

21:52.811 --> 21:54.354
Where what goes?

22:01.194 --> 22:02.154
[sighs]

22:08.201 --> 22:11.121
It's not enough to sell a DA.

22:11.204 --> 22:12.164
[Annie] Mmm…

22:12.831 --> 22:15.125
Could we grab another round of mimosas?

22:15.208 --> 22:16.585
Can I have some change?

22:18.337 --> 22:19.463
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

22:24.885 --> 22:26.261
Is that enough?

22:39.357 --> 22:40.692
[indistinct chatter]

23:15.060 --> 23:17.270
Mr. Varna needs help with his clubs.

23:25.112 --> 23:26.822
[Nick] You wanna handle it from the trunk.

23:26.905 --> 23:29.116
That way,
you don't disturb this right here.

23:29.199 --> 23:31.034
This is called a root ball.

23:31.118 --> 23:32.786
[chuckles] Tree's got a sac.

23:32.869 --> 23:36.164
Fine. Yes, it's a sac,
which is why you should protect it more.

23:36.248 --> 23:38.375
-Okay?
-What do you use for backfill?

23:39.751 --> 23:40.836
Peat moss.

23:41.670 --> 23:42.671
[Beth] Hmm.

23:43.672 --> 23:45.507
Hey, we're open to suggestions.

23:45.590 --> 23:49.177
I mean, I like bone meal personally.

23:50.053 --> 23:52.347
That sounds… nasty.

23:52.430 --> 23:54.015
Makes them grow.

23:54.683 --> 23:56.852
Like… human bones?

23:58.145 --> 24:00.063
You should see my tulips.

24:00.147 --> 24:01.356
Damn! [scoffs]

24:02.023 --> 24:02.858
Uh…

24:04.776 --> 24:07.821
You do know that these
are at-risk kids, right?

24:07.904 --> 24:09.739
Yeah, amazing.

24:09.823 --> 24:13.160
Yeah, but you just sent them on
a murder spree in the name of gardening.

24:14.119 --> 24:17.372
-But the city's gonna look great, so…
-[laughs] Okay.

24:18.081 --> 24:19.916
I… I didn't think you'd come.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.419
I didn't think councilmen
actually did anything.

24:22.502 --> 24:23.920
Oh, we try not to.

24:24.004 --> 24:27.174
No. This is more of a… campaign promise.

24:27.257 --> 24:29.050
You know how that goes.

24:30.051 --> 24:31.428
What's your brother think?

24:32.220 --> 24:33.388
Cousin.

24:34.097 --> 24:35.390
Whatever.

24:37.225 --> 24:38.310
I'm not him.

24:43.440 --> 24:45.567
It's just a choice, right?

24:48.236 --> 24:49.362
Not always.

24:50.906 --> 24:54.034
Why <i>are</i> you here, Elizabeth?

24:57.287 --> 24:58.955
I just want to plant a tree.

25:02.209 --> 25:03.543
Now you're stuck here.

25:06.838 --> 25:07.923
[boy] Yo, Councilman!

25:09.090 --> 25:10.258
Coming.

25:12.886 --> 25:15.263
-Hi. Thank you.
-[woman] Sure.

25:24.814 --> 25:25.941
Ready when you are.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.237
I don't even know why I'm here.

25:30.320 --> 25:32.822
Is it Bring-a-Total-Stranger-to-Work Day?

25:32.906 --> 25:33.907
Mmm, next week.

25:33.990 --> 25:36.034
Then you must've broken the law.

25:36.117 --> 25:37.410
That's cute.

25:39.412 --> 25:40.455
[Phoebe] How'd it start?

25:42.791 --> 25:43.708
Huh?

25:45.752 --> 25:47.837
-What's this?
-[Dave] It's not money.

25:50.048 --> 25:51.925
Don't know anything about that, my friend.

25:52.008 --> 25:55.095
Oh, really? 'Cause your club's
got more of it than toilet paper.

26:02.936 --> 26:03.937
[Gene] It's…

26:05.021 --> 26:06.564
It's not my club.

26:07.816 --> 26:09.150
[Dave] It's his, right?

26:11.027 --> 26:13.488
That's why he should be here and not you.

26:16.992 --> 26:18.785
He's not a bad guy.

26:21.579 --> 26:23.790
What kind of guy is he?

26:29.254 --> 26:31.589
[folk-country song playing]

26:31.673 --> 26:36.386
Liquor, cigarettes.
Whatever the kids would buy.

26:36.469 --> 26:39.055
Then we got into gift cards.

26:39.139 --> 26:43.059
Applebee's, Chili's,
Michaels, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.

26:43.143 --> 26:47.689
Man, we hit a triple-B so hard once,
they had to stop givin' out those coupons.

26:50.483 --> 26:53.570
Then his doctor bills
kept comin' in, comin' in.

26:54.779 --> 26:56.406
Heart medications.

26:56.489 --> 26:58.325
All these boner pills.

26:58.408 --> 27:01.745
And that's… that's when we started
knocking off the pharmacies.

27:01.828 --> 27:04.205
You know Xanny bars,
those patches with the fentanyl?

27:05.999 --> 27:06.833
Yeah.

27:06.916 --> 27:08.543
[crying]

27:08.626 --> 27:10.378
Nursing homes ain't cheap.

27:11.129 --> 27:13.423
And the man treated me
like his own grandson.

27:13.506 --> 27:15.216
[crying and sniffling]

27:16.634 --> 27:18.845
If it wasn't for him,
I'd still be in Philly

selling fireworks out of my damn trunk.

27:21.431 --> 27:23.350
[continues crying]

27:23.433 --> 27:27.437
Did I dabble in hillbilly heroin
and some other things? Oh, yeah!

27:27.520 --> 27:28.772
Guilty as charged!

27:30.106 --> 27:31.816
You haven't been charged.

27:31.900 --> 27:33.568
Then lock me up!

27:33.651 --> 27:37.155
Actually, for anything you confessed.

27:37.238 --> 27:40.700
[sniffles] That's why
this country's great.

27:41.993 --> 27:44.245
People care about people.

27:51.378 --> 27:53.046

Who the hell is that?

28:15.944 --> 28:17.195
Bris.

28:17.278 --> 28:18.696
Mmm, quite a turnout.

28:18.780 --> 28:21.032
-It's apparently quite a penis.
-[chuckles]

28:23.451 --> 28:25.829
Thanks for giving us
that guy, by the way.

28:25.912 --> 28:27.914
Oh, yeah. Anything good?

28:27.997 --> 28:29.624
Oh, my God. Tons.

28:29.707 --> 28:31.668
-Really?
-Mmm.

28:31.751 --> 28:34.462
-Confessed to pretty much every crime.
-Wow.

28:34.546 --> 28:37.215
Except for anything
having to do with your gang buddy.

28:39.008 --> 28:40.927
Well, those guys all protect each other.

28:41.010 --> 28:44.139
Mmm, this guy pretty much gave up
everyone he's ever worked with.

28:44.764 --> 28:47.267
Well, he's lying.

28:52.564 --> 28:55.984
Remember after boot camp,
when I asked you to get a juice?

28:56.067 --> 29:00.071
-Mmm-hmm.
-You said you had to pick up the kids.

29:01.781 --> 29:03.032
Right.

29:03.116 --> 29:04.576
Did you really have to?

29:12.292 --> 29:14.836
You want to get a juice?
Let's go get a damn juice.

29:20.717 --> 29:22.844
They're rounding you all up tomorrow.

29:26.723 --> 29:28.057
It's not over yet.

29:30.268 --> 29:31.644
Dave wants to go home.

29:34.063 --> 29:35.315
What do you want?

29:39.152 --> 29:40.528
Just pick a side.

30:05.637 --> 30:07.680
Look who got her head in the game.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.183
I didn't do it for you.

30:11.017 --> 30:13.061
Aw. That hurts.

30:16.147 --> 30:17.190
Mmm…

30:17.816 --> 30:20.485
Be for real with me. Who's more fun?

30:23.613 --> 30:25.031
It's all there.

30:25.865 --> 30:28.701
Me or your van people?

30:35.542 --> 30:36.835
What do you think?

30:42.507 --> 30:44.092
[sirens approaching]

30:56.771 --> 30:57.856
That's a wrap.

31:28.261 --> 31:29.262
[indistinct chatter]

31:30.346 --> 31:32.974
[chuckles] Hey, I'm not gonna make weight.

31:33.057 --> 31:36.436
You got me this new stove.
I gotta try all the burners.

31:36.519 --> 31:39.355
-Don't make me regret it.
-[chuckles] The old one worked fine.

31:39.439 --> 31:41.524
Yeah, if you didn't need to use the oven.

31:41.608 --> 31:43.151
-[chuckles]
-Taste that.

31:44.402 --> 31:45.695
-It's going back.
-[Rosa gasps]

31:45.778 --> 31:48.072
-[chuckles]
-Don't you dare.

31:48.156 --> 31:49.282
[indistinct chatter]

31:59.542 --> 32:02.128
[indistinct chatter over police radio]

32:03.129 --> 32:04.213
That's him.

32:27.570 --> 32:29.030
[muffled indistinct chatter]

32:39.123 --> 32:40.708
-Come on!
-[Vance] Ten years.

32:40.792 --> 32:42.710
If this was a bar, I'd card you.

32:42.794 --> 32:45.421
-Stop!
-You wanna lock it in with R-cubed.

32:45.505 --> 32:48.633
Rejuvenate, refresh, rewind.

32:49.384 --> 32:50.510
Hey, baby.

32:53.054 --> 32:54.931
-Buzzkill.
-Beth?

32:57.308 --> 32:59.143
You look so young,
she didn't recognize you.

32:59.227 --> 33:00.353
Excuse me, boys.

33:04.190 --> 33:06.109
They're leaving soon, I promise.

33:06.192 --> 33:09.320
Ride got a late start
'cause Vance was at some conference.

33:10.989 --> 33:11.948
Is that…

33:12.949 --> 33:14.117
Is that okay?

33:18.413 --> 33:19.539
We got him.

33:24.085 --> 33:25.086
"Him" him?

33:46.107 --> 33:47.108
[scoffs]

33:54.824 --> 33:55.742
[Phoebe] <i>I call dibs.</i>

33:55.825 --> 33:57.869
-You can't do that.
-Just did.

33:57.952 --> 33:59.287
Then I call rank.

33:59.370 --> 34:01.706
-I got a better angle on him.
-What's that?

34:01.789 --> 34:02.707
These.

34:02.790 --> 34:05.293
-[scoffs] Means nothing.
-To that guy?

34:05.376 --> 34:07.211
It'll get you about as much as this.

34:07.295 --> 34:09.172
I think he's more into these than that.

34:09.255 --> 34:11.841
-Trust me. You never know.
-[scoffs]

34:11.924 --> 34:14.052
-Okay. Rock, paper, scissors.
-Fine.

34:15.511 --> 34:18.389
-Still using these.
-Sure. If you can find 'em.

34:21.809 --> 34:22.894
[officer] Whoa, whoa, whoa!

34:22.977 --> 34:25.063
Private meeting. No one's allowed in.

34:25.146 --> 34:27.106
-We are.
-'Cause of this.

34:27.190 --> 34:29.358
-Under orders.
-[Dave] So are we.

34:29.442 --> 34:30.485
Mine are from above.

34:30.568 --> 34:31.986
Ours are above your above.

34:32.945 --> 34:37.033
Uh…You can't… You can't go in. You…

34:40.912 --> 34:42.080
Where is he?

34:42.163 --> 34:43.539
He walked.

34:44.582 --> 34:46.626
-What?
-That's impossible.

34:46.709 --> 34:48.294
[officer] DA didn't charge him.

34:48.377 --> 34:50.546
Guess there's someone above all of us.

34:53.758 --> 34:56.344
["Birdman" playing]

35:10.775 --> 35:11.984
You owe me.

35:12.068 --> 35:13.444
Add it to the list.

35:17.406 --> 35:19.117
So what do we do about her?

35:20.284 --> 35:21.953
Well, not what you wanna do.

35:24.247 --> 35:25.832
Don't see any other way.

35:28.751 --> 35:30.253
That's why you got me, brother.

35:31.045 --> 35:32.672
-Cousin.
-[chuckles]

35:33.381 --> 35:35.049
-Right.
-Right.

You hungry?

36:00.241 --> 36:03.619
-What do you know about mail fraud?
-It's bad.

36:03.703 --> 36:06.539
Mmm-hmm. Get-you-five-years bad.
How about tax evasion?

36:07.165 --> 36:08.124
Real bad.

36:08.207 --> 36:09.292
Ten to twenty.

36:10.042 --> 36:13.296
What about, uh, inappropriate behavior
with an exotic animal?

36:14.881 --> 36:17.216
Swear to God. Something with a hedgehog.

36:19.719 --> 36:21.137
Why are you asking me this?

36:21.220 --> 36:25.933
'Cause you add all that up,
that's how long Gene is out of our lives.

36:27.435 --> 36:28.644
Ding-dong.

36:29.228 --> 36:30.605
You know what this means?

36:30.688 --> 36:35.026
Yeah. The witch is dead.
That's why I said "ding-dong."

36:35.109 --> 36:36.819
We're free, baby.

36:39.030 --> 36:40.823
How's it feel, boo?

36:41.616 --> 36:42.491
[sighs]

36:44.327 --> 36:46.662
I feel like the luckiest
son of a bitch alive.

36:50.875 --> 36:51.918
What?

36:59.300 --> 37:01.260
The hedgehog might have you beat.

37:02.386 --> 37:05.348
Yeah. Not alive anymore.

37:13.064 --> 37:13.940
[Dean] <i>Left?</i>

37:14.941 --> 37:15.983
Or right?

37:19.987 --> 37:21.697
-Left.
-What?

37:21.781 --> 37:23.950
I'm sorry. Right. I meant right.

37:24.033 --> 37:26.494
It's the right side.
It has way less lines.

37:26.577 --> 37:27.662
You look great.

37:28.663 --> 37:29.789
[clicks tongue]

37:29.872 --> 37:31.582
It's only 'cause the system works.

37:32.500 --> 37:33.918
And I could do it anywhere.

37:35.002 --> 37:38.172
Like, I could do it in Nevada.

37:40.508 --> 37:42.551
How much does all this cost?

37:44.011 --> 37:47.974
I mean… I think you have
to think of it as an investment.

37:48.057 --> 37:51.894
We're getting in at the ground floor.
Who knows where this thing can go?

37:52.770 --> 37:53.854
Only up.

37:56.607 --> 37:57.525
Really?

37:58.901 --> 38:01.070
Yeah. Now that you're a part of it.

38:03.990 --> 38:04.991
Thanks.

38:07.952 --> 38:12.790
I'll go see Vance to go over the products
one more time before I meet corporate.

38:12.873 --> 38:13.874
All right.

38:18.296 --> 38:20.840
-Obviously the right side…
-Go. Go.

[Dean] I won't be late.

38:43.571 --> 38:44.989
You'll wake the kids.

38:51.537 --> 38:52.955
I didn't have a choice.

38:54.665 --> 38:55.916
Yeah, you did.

38:58.127 --> 39:00.421
-No, they--
-You just didn't choose me.

39:03.591 --> 39:05.301
Please don't hurt my kids.

39:06.260 --> 39:08.095
I ain't gonna hurt nobody.

39:13.768 --> 39:15.311
But I turned you in.

Got you something.

39:38.417 --> 39:39.418

They're all the same.

39:51.597 --> 39:53.099
Could have had my back.

39:54.016 --> 39:55.142
I did.

39:56.977 --> 39:57.853
How?

39:57.937 --> 40:00.523
I'm the one who ended up doing
the six-month stretch, cousin.

Brother.

Got banned from the gym.

You don't need that, either.

Now they trust me.

40:42.565 --> 40:44.817
Now they'll believe
anything you tell them.

We can do whatever we want.
