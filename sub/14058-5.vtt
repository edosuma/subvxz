Always helps.

Roquefort-Plimpton et al
v. Blatco.

30:11.310 --> 30:15.581

you have to imagine

Any questions?

30:21.453 --> 30:23.589
That was rhetorical.

30:49.648 --> 30:54.520
Economic rejuvenation
is a justifiable public use
to exercise eminent domain.

30:54.553 --> 30:57.623
- And in English,
that would be?
- That was English.

The mini-mall's a wash.
The skating rink's ambiguous.

be a public benefit, and that
benefit must be clearly defined.

you would say?

43:59.871 --> 44:02.273
What?

44:04.342 --> 44:07.312
So, Ken, got any bags?

44:07.345 --> 44:10.882
- What?
- Yeah.

44:10.916 --> 44:13.952
Uh, I left it
on the front step.

44:13.985 --> 44:16.087
Allow me.

44:29.968 --> 44:32.704
[ Man ]
* I woke up
Wished that I was dead *

44:32.738 --> 44:34.806
* With an aching in my head

44:34.840 --> 44:37.843
* I lay motionless in bed

44:37.876 --> 44:39.978
* The night is here

44:40.011 --> 44:42.447
* The day is gone

44:42.480 --> 44:46.852
* And the world
spins madly on *

44:46.885 --> 44:51.389
* Thought of you
and where you've gone *

44:51.422 --> 44:55.894
* And the world
spins madly on *

44:55.927 --> 45:00.165
* And the world
spins madly on *

45:00.198 --> 45:02.167
* And the world

45:02.200 --> 45:06.872
* Spins madly on

45:06.905 --> 45:11.176
* And on and on *
