WEBVTT

02:05.607 --> 02:08.443
Well, look at you, my beauties.

02:09.311 --> 02:10.946
Come on, girls.

02:10.978 --> 02:12.714
Oh, there you go.

02:16.984 --> 02:18.520
You are beautiful,

02:18.554 --> 02:20.723
you are beautiful...

02:22.424 --> 02:24.393
..but you're the best.

02:25.994 --> 02:28.030
Yeah, there you are.

02:31.767 --> 02:33.035
Come on.

03:09.638 --> 03:13.242
What is it, Kip?
What's up, mate?

04:14.369 --> 04:16.806
In you get, Kip. Come on.

04:17.806 --> 04:19.041
Hup!

04:20.241 --> 04:21.876
Alright, come on.

04:41.830 --> 04:43.899
Hey, Floss, come on!

04:43.931 --> 04:45.600
Come on, girl.

04:45.633 --> 04:48.037
Come on, come on. Good dog.

04:53.874 --> 04:56.112
Come on, Kip. Come on.

04:57.112 --> 04:59.881
Come on.

06:36.845 --> 06:39.148
Good boy. Hey.

06:39.181 --> 06:41.250
How are you, Col? You right?

06:41.282 --> 06:42.650
Yeah, good.

06:58.799 --> 07:00.602
How's my man?

07:02.136 --> 07:04.872
Oh! Now we're into
the good gear.

07:04.905 --> 07:07.643
- Lionel.
- Colin.

07:09.311 --> 07:11.412
You mind if I just
have a little...?

07:11.446 --> 07:13.381
- No.
- Thank you.

07:17.484 --> 07:19.220
G'day, Col.

07:19.253 --> 07:20.888
Matt.

07:20.922 --> 07:23.359
Ooh! Hey.

07:26.027 --> 07:27.863
Wow.

07:27.895 --> 07:29.732
How do you do it, mate?

07:30.532 --> 07:32.434
Hiya, Frenchie.

07:35.570 --> 07:37.439
He's gonna be a busy boy,
I reckon.

07:37.472 --> 07:39.909
What do you mean?

07:41.643 --> 07:44.645
See all these
blokes all dressed up,

07:44.679 --> 07:47.149
walking 'round like
they run the shop?

07:47.181 --> 07:49.051
Merino farmers.

07:49.083 --> 07:51.252
They got millions
of merino mummies

07:51.285 --> 07:53.955
looking for the absolute best...

07:53.989 --> 07:57.459
..daddies, Kalgan Horns,

07:57.491 --> 07:59.393
so they can have
millions of adorable,

07:59.426 --> 08:01.229
little, delicious babies.

08:01.263 --> 08:03.364
We can have
merinos on our farm!

08:03.398 --> 08:06.234
Nah, nah, we're not merino.

08:06.268 --> 08:08.570
Merinos are...

08:08.602 --> 08:10.304
Well, if you're gonna
farm sheep...

08:10.337 --> 08:11.573
Farm a real sheep.

08:11.605 --> 08:13.307
You see, Maddie,
you have to understand,

08:13.340 --> 08:14.643
merinos are like beer.

08:14.676 --> 08:16.411
Kalgan Horns are like champagne.

08:16.443 --> 08:18.547
You never struck me as
the champagne type, Lionel.

08:18.580 --> 08:20.048
I dunno. Rum and Coke, then.

08:20.080 --> 08:23.785
Kalgan Horns
are more like a craft beer,

08:23.818 --> 08:26.555
you know, smaller vats,
select ingredients.

08:26.587 --> 08:28.556
I'm trialling organic hops
this year, actually.

08:28.590 --> 08:30.325
Oh, you can feed it
to your llamas.

08:30.357 --> 08:32.994
Alpacas. They're alpacas.

08:33.994 --> 08:35.763
Hmph.

08:35.797 --> 08:37.298
Righto.

08:37.331 --> 08:39.367
Yeah,
it's a fine ram, alright.

08:39.401 --> 08:41.070
Be a close call, I reckon.

08:43.738 --> 08:46.008
Hey, hey, hey!
Hands off, mate.

08:57.418 --> 08:59.388
Jackson.

08:59.421 --> 09:01.256
All those breeders registered?

09:01.288 --> 09:03.624
Er, yeah, yeah. All here.

09:03.657 --> 09:07.095
Um, actually,
I haven't got, er...

09:09.730 --> 09:10.765
Oh!

09:10.798 --> 09:12.967
I'll register Les
for you, shall I?

09:13.000 --> 09:14.802
Yeah, no worries.

09:16.870 --> 09:18.472
Thanks, Mum!

09:22.377 --> 09:24.212
<i>One, two, two.</i>

09:24.244 --> 09:25.846
OK!

09:25.879 --> 09:28.616
<i>This is the one we've
all been waiting for, folks -</i>

09:28.649 --> 09:31.619
<i>the Kalgan Horn ram judging,</i>

09:31.652 --> 09:34.589
<i>the Tom Stocks Memorial Cup.</i>

09:34.622 --> 09:37.126
That's my old man.

09:38.393 --> 09:39.860
Uh, yeah.

09:39.893 --> 09:45.100
<i>Judging today is the new
district vet Kat O'Connell,</i>

09:45.133 --> 09:48.402
<i>who is from Dorset in the UK,</i>

09:48.436 --> 09:51.373
<i>which is home to
the Kalgan's ancestor sheep,</i>

09:51.406 --> 09:53.175
<i>the Dorset Horn.</i>

09:53.207 --> 09:55.142
Oh, and Sal too.

09:55.176 --> 09:58.113
She's, er...
she's the apprentice.

09:58.146 --> 10:02.851
So... Yeah, anyway, er...

10:02.883 --> 10:04.186
<i>Hang on a tick.</i>

10:04.219 --> 10:06.088
<i>Oh, hey, steady on, Frenchie!</i>

10:07.622 --> 10:10.726
<i>Kalgan Horn were first bred
by the Grimurson family</i>

10:10.758 --> 10:14.262
<i>in the Plantagenet region
in 1924,</i>

10:14.295 --> 10:15.797
<i>thriving in the wet winters</i>

10:15.830 --> 10:18.432
<i>and particularly able to survive
through the hot, dry summers.</i>

10:18.465 --> 10:19.500
Come on up.

10:19.533 --> 10:20.634
<i>It is so well-suited</i>

10:20.667 --> 10:22.203
<i>to our unique microclimate</i>

10:22.236 --> 10:24.071
<i>that it is bred nowhere else</i>

10:24.104 --> 10:25.907
<i>in the Southern Hemisphere.</i>

10:26.975 --> 10:31.412
<i>First-cross lambs from
Kalgan Horn are market-ready</i>

10:31.446 --> 10:33.547
<i>or can be joined
with a short-wool...</i>

10:33.580 --> 10:34.950
Great.

10:36.450 --> 10:39.354
- Oh, you're gorgeous.
- What's that?

10:39.387 --> 10:41.422
I was talking to my sheep.

10:43.925 --> 10:47.529
I'd like to see a little
less square in the nose.

10:47.561 --> 10:49.364
I mean, it's acceptable but...

10:49.397 --> 10:50.898
Pretty good for a llama, but.

10:50.931 --> 10:54.735
With the muzzle, it needs
to be like a mandarin rind.

10:54.768 --> 10:57.038
You want it rough
and a little bit loose.

10:57.071 --> 10:58.740
Don't we all?

11:00.475 --> 11:03.412
Yeah, nothing. All good. Sorry.

11:03.445 --> 11:06.148
Not appropriate.

11:08.450 --> 11:10.051
<i>Oh!</i>

11:10.085 --> 11:12.119
Unlu... unlucky, Mum.

11:12.152 --> 11:14.123
Oh, well.

11:15.889 --> 11:17.658
See ya, Frenchie.

11:17.691 --> 11:19.994
<i>Ooh,
there goes Frenchie.</i>

11:20.027 --> 11:22.764
- What? No!
- No!

11:24.165 --> 11:26.268
Down to the final three, folks.

11:26.301 --> 11:29.571
<i>Wouldn't we all love to take
the champion ram home today</i>

11:29.604 --> 11:31.605
<i>and put him over
one of our ewes, eh?</i>

11:31.638 --> 11:33.642
<i>Well, you need to pay
for the privilege</i>

11:33.675 --> 11:35.944
<i>and the winning breeder
will make sure of that.</i>

11:36.945 --> 11:39.580
<i>Ah! Bad luck, Lionel.</i>

11:39.614 --> 11:41.917
<i>No surprises here,
ladies and gents.</i>

11:41.950 --> 11:44.018
The Grimurson brothers
find themselves

11:44.051 --> 11:45.787
<i>the last two standing yet again.</i>

11:45.820 --> 11:47.922
<i>You get one of their lads
over your ewes,</i>

11:47.955 --> 11:49.490
<i>they'll be pinging
lambs back at you</i>

11:49.523 --> 11:51.025
left, right and centre,
no worries.

11:53.460 --> 11:56.330
The muscling
in this hindquarter,

11:56.364 --> 11:58.200
it's...

11:58.233 --> 12:00.435
..unsurpassed.

12:00.468 --> 12:02.404
A lot of meat on that carcass.

12:02.436 --> 12:05.073
Great carcass, mate. Good job.

12:18.018 --> 12:19.421
OK.

12:22.322 --> 12:24.492
<i>And Les Grimurson
is the winner!</i>

12:31.965 --> 12:34.168
You little ripper!

12:34.201 --> 12:36.104
I'll get it.

12:37.104 --> 12:40.642
There you go. Yeah, no worries.

12:47.648 --> 12:50.885
G'day, can I just
get a pot of this

12:50.918 --> 12:54.355
and a Summer Breeze,
a pink one, please?

12:54.388 --> 12:56.323
Thank you. Thanks very much.

12:59.259 --> 13:02.130
Here we go.

13:04.831 --> 13:07.034
Angela, Sally, at the bar.

13:07.067 --> 13:08.936
- Oh, hey.
- I saw you at the show.

13:08.970 --> 13:10.372
- Yeah.
- Boyd.

13:10.404 --> 13:12.239
- Oh, yeah. Sally.
- Lovely to meet you, Sally.

13:12.273 --> 13:14.008
- Yeah, you too.
- You local?

13:14.042 --> 13:16.610
Oh-ho! That's rough.

13:16.643 --> 13:18.679
He's a real heartbreaker,
your boy.

13:18.713 --> 13:20.348
Chip off the old block, eh?

13:24.349 --> 13:25.886
I meant you, not Stocksy.

13:25.920 --> 13:27.955
Not that he wasn't...
You know, I was...

13:27.989 --> 13:30.792
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

13:30.825 --> 13:33.527
- Oh, come on, Col. Cheer up.
- What?

13:33.561 --> 13:35.330
You're a shoe-in next year,
mate, I reckon.

13:35.363 --> 13:36.731
It's just that
hindquarter muscle, mate.

13:36.763 --> 13:38.566
That was the only difference.

13:38.600 --> 13:39.768
I reckon he knows that, mate.

13:39.801 --> 13:42.037
Yeah, I know he knows that.
I'm just tryin'...

13:42.070 --> 13:43.438
Righto.

13:43.470 --> 13:44.739
- Righto.
- Righto.

13:53.947 --> 13:56.917
- Hey.
- What have you got there, mate?

13:56.950 --> 13:58.720
Oh, I just, er... They're...

13:58.753 --> 14:00.722
I... I just drink 'em
sometimes, so...

14:00.754 --> 14:02.657
"I just drink 'em sometimes."

14:03.825 --> 14:05.960
- Stop it!
- Just leave him alone.

14:05.994 --> 14:07.394
- What?
- Cheers, darlin'.

14:07.427 --> 14:08.763
Hey, Jacko,
I drink 'em too, mate.

14:08.796 --> 14:11.700
Leave him alone!

14:22.944 --> 14:24.446
So what's the story

14:24.479 --> 14:27.415
with this hindquarter
muscle, then, eh?

14:27.447 --> 14:29.783
Hmm? Come on.

14:29.816 --> 14:33.687
Let's have a look at you.
Come on, mate.

14:33.720 --> 14:35.690
Yep.

14:39.259 --> 14:41.028
What is this?

14:46.301 --> 14:49.838
Ohh! Oh, G...

15:02.215 --> 15:03.884
Mate, we gotta go.

15:03.917 --> 15:05.720
Come on. Good boy.

15:05.753 --> 15:09.791
Come on. Yeah,
we gotta get outta here.

15:12.994 --> 15:15.263
We gotta get this off you. Whoa.

15:15.296 --> 15:18.467
Oh, whoa. No, mate, wait.

15:21.268 --> 15:22.936
It's OK.

15:22.970 --> 15:24.672
It's alright.

15:34.081 --> 15:35.883
Hey, Mr Grimurson.

15:36.883 --> 15:38.085
It's Sal.

15:38.119 --> 15:40.321
- Sally.
- Huh?

15:40.354 --> 15:42.691
Gary and Susan's oldest.

15:43.691 --> 15:45.060
She in?

15:50.330 --> 15:51.733
Good morning!

15:53.200 --> 15:55.836
I was just thinking about you.

15:56.803 --> 15:58.105
Were you?

15:59.639 --> 16:03.010
You're a welcome distraction
from faecal samples.

16:04.144 --> 16:05.913
Uh...

16:08.383 --> 16:10.518
Ah, here.

16:10.551 --> 16:13.287
Um, thank you, Colin, for this.

16:13.321 --> 16:15.389
Uh, you're right.

16:15.422 --> 16:17.325
The writing's not gonna
set the world on fire,

16:17.358 --> 16:19.828
but that stuff
about your family,

16:19.860 --> 16:24.532
the Grimurson family,
that's, er... quite a saga.

16:26.667 --> 16:28.103
What's up?

16:29.336 --> 16:31.105
Les's ram.

16:32.105 --> 16:34.208
I think it has OJD.

16:34.242 --> 16:36.144
Johne's disease?

16:36.176 --> 16:39.313
No, Colin. I don't think you
need to worry about that.

16:39.346 --> 16:41.917
He has all the symptoms.

16:44.484 --> 16:46.321
Um, listen,
do you want anything,

16:46.354 --> 16:48.355
a tea or a juice or...?

16:48.388 --> 16:50.959
No. No, thanks.

16:54.595 --> 16:56.398
As far as I know,

16:56.431 --> 17:02.003
you've never, ever had OJD
in this part of the world.

17:05.639 --> 17:09.410
And don't forget, I had
a good look at that ram.

17:09.444 --> 17:11.279
But you were judging.

17:11.311 --> 17:13.615
You... you were looking
for different things.

17:13.648 --> 17:16.484
Would you like me
to have another look?

17:18.519 --> 17:20.722
I could talk to Les.

17:20.754 --> 17:22.623
Would you?

17:25.193 --> 17:27.896
You two haven't spoken
in 40 years.

17:28.995 --> 17:30.398
Why start now?

17:30.430 --> 17:32.833
If it is OJD,
what are the chances

17:32.867 --> 17:34.903
that both our flocks
are infected?

17:34.936 --> 17:36.905
I don't think it is OJD.

17:39.940 --> 17:41.108
Right.

17:43.977 --> 17:45.413
Ta.

17:48.683 --> 17:50.919
What a load of crap.
Who gave you that idea?

17:50.952 --> 17:53.488
Alright, so we get
the results within 48 hours.

17:53.521 --> 17:55.557
You don't need 48 hours.

17:55.590 --> 17:57.391
I can tell you now
it's bullshit.

17:57.425 --> 18:00.128
Just doing my job, Les.

18:00.160 --> 18:02.464
It's bullshit,
isn't it, mate?

18:02.496 --> 18:05.566
She wouldn't know what she's
on about.

18:05.600 --> 18:07.202
We'll take
good care of him.

18:29.122 --> 18:30.891
Come on, Kip.

18:40.067 --> 18:41.936
Come on, mate. You're alright.

18:49.209 --> 18:51.011
Alright, mate, there we go.

18:51.044 --> 18:53.214
There you go. Yep.

18:53.246 --> 18:57.017
Cop that, ya sneaky bastard!

18:57.051 --> 18:58.820
OJD?!

18:58.852 --> 19:01.421
Bullshit, it's OJD!

19:01.455 --> 19:05.225
You're a sore loser,
you miserable prick!

19:05.259 --> 19:07.829
Oi! Col!

19:11.432 --> 19:13.768
You're as weak as piss!

19:15.770 --> 19:17.539
Weak as piss.

19:18.438 --> 19:20.708
Eh, Col, get out here!

19:21.509 --> 19:24.579
You want 'em
to kill my ram.

19:24.611 --> 19:27.148
Ya think you can do that?

19:27.180 --> 19:29.049
Murderer!

19:29.082 --> 19:31.418
Come out here, you weak prick.

19:45.099 --> 19:47.068
Shot your boot!

19:53.139 --> 19:55.042
Shot your boot.

20:06.153 --> 20:07.822
Yeah...

20:13.159 --> 20:15.062
Oh!

20:16.830 --> 20:20.001
Bugger, shit, damn,
poop, cack, Robb's Jetty.

20:24.437 --> 20:27.676
Bugger, shit, damn,
poop, cack, Robb's Jetty.

20:29.909 --> 20:33.881
Bugger, shit, damn,
poop, cack, Robb's Jetty.

21:43.050 --> 21:44.653
- Lionel.
- Eh.

21:45.686 --> 21:47.922
- Brang the young fella along.
- Hey.

21:49.255 --> 21:51.692
So what's this about?

21:51.725 --> 21:55.964
Oh, you know, just a bit of, um,
target practice last night.

22:05.906 --> 22:08.576
- So are you sure?
- What?

22:08.609 --> 22:11.279
Les's ram,
are you sure it's OJD?

22:11.311 --> 22:13.548
No, I'm... Look.

22:13.580 --> 22:16.685
I'm not an expert.
Kat's the expert.

22:17.618 --> 22:19.788
Don't whip it around.
Just hold it steady.

22:20.588 --> 22:22.523
Shit, if we got OJD
in the valley...

22:22.555 --> 22:25.258
You lot on the east side,
you don't have to worry.

22:25.292 --> 22:27.294
Mate, that creature's
already been joined up

22:27.328 --> 22:29.798
with half me ewes,
same as Bob's.

22:48.581 --> 22:52.386

22:52.418 --> 22:56.090

Come on, dog.

23:11.004 --> 23:15.943
<i>♪ No end in sight... ♪</i>

23:15.975 --> 23:17.811
Go to Les.

23:28.388 --> 23:30.123
What have you
got there, Floss?

23:30.157 --> 23:32.060
Come on.

23:42.168 --> 23:43.838
Bullshit.

24:01.120 --> 24:04.725
You were right.
It's OJD.

24:09.230 --> 24:11.032
Yeah, I'm so sorry, Colin.

24:12.032 --> 24:13.935
I should have, um...

24:18.504 --> 24:20.541
The Department.

24:20.573 --> 24:23.276
I'm so sorry. I've only just
found out about this myself.

24:23.310 --> 24:26.947
They, um... they need
access to the farm.

24:26.981 --> 24:29.217
<i>Plantagenet sheep farmers</i>

24:29.250 --> 24:30.751
<i>have been shocked
by the discovery</i>

24:30.783 --> 24:32.686
<i>of a highly infectious disease</i>

24:32.719 --> 24:35.188
<i>on a stud farm
near Mount Barker.</i>

24:35.222 --> 24:37.625
<i>Ovine Johne's disease, or OJD,</i>

24:37.657 --> 24:39.260
<i>is caused by bacteria</i>

24:39.292 --> 24:41.094
<i>attacking the lining of the gut.</i>

24:41.128 --> 24:42.696
<i>The disease has been present</i>

24:42.730 --> 24:44.365
<i>in other parts of the country,</i>

24:44.398 --> 24:46.533
<i>but until now there
hasn't been an outbreak</i>

24:46.567 --> 24:48.402
<i>in Western Australia.</i>

24:48.435 --> 24:51.071
<i>Affected sheep can
no longer absorb nutrients</i>

24:51.105 --> 24:53.541
<i>and ultimately starve to death.</i>

24:53.573 --> 24:56.943
<i>OJD has the potential
to be especially devastating</i>

24:56.976 --> 24:58.512
<i>in the Mount Barker region,</i>

24:58.544 --> 25:01.448
<i>with its unique heritage breeds
and higher rainfall.</i>

25:01.482 --> 25:04.585
<i>The Department of Agriculture's
infectious diseases team</i>

25:04.618 --> 25:06.987
<i>has travelled
to the Plantagenet region</i>

25:07.021 --> 25:08.556
<i>to carry out further testing</i>

25:08.589 --> 25:11.091
<i>in the hope of containing
the outbreak.</i>

25:11.125 --> 25:12.859
<i>An emergency bio-control plan</i>

25:12.892 --> 25:15.328
<i>has been put in place
for the entire valley</i>

25:15.361 --> 25:17.163
<i>and local farmers
have been ordered</i>

25:17.196 --> 25:18.899
<i>to slaughter their sheep.</i>

25:18.933 --> 25:21.702
<i>It's a cruel blow for

25:21.734 --> 25:23.937
<i>from a fatal bushfire
two years ago</i>

25:23.971 --> 25:28.743
<i>which took the life
of top breeder Tom Stocks.</i>

25:34.747 --> 25:36.516
Col.

25:47.194 --> 25:49.931
So what do we do now, you know?

25:49.964 --> 25:52.566
- Like, I mean do we...
- There's no fighting it.

25:52.599 --> 25:54.268
That's it, mate. Done deal.

25:54.301 --> 25:56.570
Yeah, I know,
but they found, like, what?

25:56.602 --> 25:59.005
Only 20-odd head
infected on two farms?

25:59.039 --> 26:00.407
I mean, mine were clear.

26:00.440 --> 26:02.075
Yeah, it's the contact
between farms.

26:02.109 --> 26:04.011
It's... it's...

26:04.043 --> 26:05.713
Well...

26:06.612 --> 26:08.048
..they don't muck around
with this stuff.

26:08.081 --> 26:10.382
They're taking the whole
bloody valley. That's it.

26:10.384 --> 26:12.720
Why don't they take us
while they're at it?

26:12.753 --> 26:15.622
- Finish the job.
- Look, let's not...

26:15.656 --> 26:17.457
I think we need
to trust the Department.

26:17.491 --> 26:19.493
Oh, the bloody Department!

26:19.525 --> 26:22.529
Yeah, I mean, them?

26:22.562 --> 26:25.932
That Pommy vet,
she's bloody useless.

26:25.965 --> 26:27.667
They don't know, do they?

26:27.701 --> 26:31.105
They just... they just
come down here and...

26:35.042 --> 26:37.712
Jackson, be a darl?

26:40.613 --> 26:43.183
It's overkill, obviously.

26:43.216 --> 26:45.186
Well,
they don't care, do they?

26:45.218 --> 26:46.821
Easier to wipe out
our whole valley

26:46.853 --> 26:49.489
than risk it finding its way
to their precious merinos.

26:49.523 --> 26:51.559
Even then, you'd think
there'd be a bit of leeway

26:51.591 --> 26:53.293
for such a rare breed.

26:53.327 --> 26:55.061
I mean, the entire
breeding stock.

26:55.094 --> 26:56.529
They're not pandas, mate.

26:56.562 --> 26:58.733
- I'm not saying that...
- It's overkill.

26:59.532 --> 27:02.703
But the decision's been made.
We can't fight bureaucracy.

27:02.735 --> 27:04.304
Bullshit.

27:04.338 --> 27:06.507
They can decide all they want.

27:07.307 --> 27:08.876
They're not taking my sheep.

27:08.908 --> 27:11.811
You don't have a choice, Les.
They're gonna come and take 'em.

27:11.844 --> 27:15.549
Oh, you go on and do whatever
you want, the lot of you.

27:16.350 --> 27:21.990
Yeah, go on! Obey orders
from bloody bureaucrats.

27:23.424 --> 27:27.228
But not me. Not my flock.

27:27.261 --> 27:30.031
No, no. No.

27:35.769 --> 27:37.605
Here, Jacko.

28:42.168 --> 28:46.607
Uh, Colin,
this is Brian De Vries.

28:46.639 --> 28:49.209
Yeah, I know.
From the Department.

28:49.243 --> 28:52.580
- What are you up to?
- Hey?

28:52.612 --> 28:54.614
- What are you working on?
- Oh.

28:54.648 --> 28:57.318
You know, I was just fixing
a board on my deck there

28:58.349 --> 29:00.687
and I saw some dry rot
in a stump.

29:00.721 --> 29:02.790
Next thing you know,
you're drawing up plans

29:02.822 --> 29:04.591
and this and that.

29:04.625 --> 29:06.794
Full reno, eh?

29:06.827 --> 29:08.462
Been there.

29:08.494 --> 29:10.830
- Good timing.
- What?

29:10.863 --> 29:14.100
I mean, you know,
you got plenty of time now.

29:14.134 --> 29:15.436
You know, now...

29:15.468 --> 29:17.670
Well, you won't
have any sheep to...

29:17.704 --> 29:18.705
Sorry.

29:18.738 --> 29:21.040
Colin, we need
to run you through

29:21.073 --> 29:22.976
the decontamination process.

29:24.778 --> 29:26.247
Yeah, right.

29:26.280 --> 29:29.583
All this old wool,
obviously, um...

29:29.616 --> 29:33.487
..rags and, um, bits of
old hessian sacks,

29:33.520 --> 29:35.856
they'll have to be burned.

29:35.888 --> 29:37.457
You'll be fully
reimbursed, though,

29:37.491 --> 29:39.493
of course, for everything.

29:39.525 --> 29:42.897
Oh! Things like this, old tools.

29:42.929 --> 29:44.465
Um...

29:45.698 --> 29:48.701
The worst of the porous wood,
that'll have to go.

29:48.734 --> 29:51.104
You can hold onto all this.

29:51.138 --> 29:54.542
Kettle. Kettle should be fine.

29:55.341 --> 29:59.946
Actually, the whole place
is in pretty good nick.

29:59.980 --> 30:01.916
Steel cladding -

30:01.948 --> 30:03.449
just needs a good clean.

30:03.483 --> 30:05.719
Bad luck for you.

30:05.752 --> 30:07.021
Eh?

30:07.053 --> 30:08.989
Oh, we do new for old, so...

30:09.822 --> 30:14.027
Like next door here,
your brother's shed.

30:20.533 --> 30:23.070
It's an absolute wreck.

30:23.102 --> 30:25.538
Old and rotten.

30:25.571 --> 30:28.274
Whole thing's gotta go,
get replaced.

30:28.308 --> 30:30.077
Brand-new shed.

30:30.109 --> 30:32.713
He'll be laughing.

30:32.745 --> 30:35.049
Hey, retro.

30:39.820 --> 30:42.590
Grandfather
built this shed.

30:43.389 --> 30:45.758
Him and his brother,
90-odd years ago,

30:45.792 --> 30:48.195
from timber
they milled themselves,

30:48.227 --> 30:51.664
from trees they felled when
they cleared the land here.

30:51.697 --> 30:55.570
Yeah, you had to
in those days.

30:56.469 --> 30:59.472
I reckon we spent
half our lives in here.

31:02.175 --> 31:04.445
Bit easier now though, eh?

31:05.579 --> 31:07.414
You know, there's
a bloke in town...

31:07.446 --> 31:10.016
You know what his job is?

31:11.517 --> 31:15.188
He installs sheds. Yeah.

31:15.222 --> 31:16.790
He doesn't build you a shed.

31:16.822 --> 31:18.524
He installs a shed,

31:18.558 --> 31:21.128
prefabricated from...

31:21.160 --> 31:22.895
..a factory somewhere.

31:22.928 --> 31:24.831
China probably. Hmm.

31:25.631 --> 31:27.734
I'll get you his number, eh?

31:30.102 --> 31:31.371
Dickhead.

31:31.405 --> 31:33.907
Anyway, the transport
should be here Friday,

31:33.939 --> 31:35.174
fingers crossed.

31:35.207 --> 31:37.844
Been an absolute nightmare
trying to find stock trucks.

31:37.878 --> 31:39.679
No-one wants
to touch these sheep.

31:39.713 --> 31:42.081
The Department
is setting up a facility

31:42.115 --> 31:44.218
to... deal with them humanely.

31:44.251 --> 31:45.819
- A facility?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

31:45.851 --> 31:48.455
Don't get me started.
That's a whole 'nother headache.

31:48.487 --> 31:49.822
I tried to tell Perth.

31:49.856 --> 31:51.625
Finding someone
to process these sheep,

31:51.657 --> 31:53.660
I mean, they have
no idea, no idea.

31:53.694 --> 31:56.530
They were raised here.
I raised them.

31:56.562 --> 31:58.799
They will rest on this land.

32:01.635 --> 32:04.104
Colin, you know
there's counselling.

32:06.473 --> 32:09.777
Failing that,
I'm always up for a cuppa.

32:10.644 --> 32:13.013
A cup of wine, preferably.

32:15.881 --> 32:17.717
I wish...

32:17.751 --> 32:19.453
No, it's fine.

32:19.485 --> 32:21.321
It's fine. It's OK.

32:21.355 --> 32:23.024
OK.

32:34.400 --> 32:38.037
You know, these people...

32:38.071 --> 32:40.073
It means everything to them.

32:41.174 --> 32:43.577
No reception!

32:43.609 --> 32:45.779
You just forget

32:45.811 --> 32:47.947
what it's like out here,
don't you?

32:50.082 --> 32:51.951
Yeah, you do.

32:54.388 --> 32:56.724
Hup!

32:58.058 --> 32:59.393
Hup!

33:01.395 --> 33:04.365
Hup! Hup!

33:05.765 --> 33:07.435
Get up there.

33:37.263 --> 33:40.100
You're beautiful...

33:40.132 --> 33:42.135
..and you're beautiful...

33:43.570 --> 33:46.573
..and you're beautiful.

35:47.393 --> 35:49.897
- No!
- Les!

35:49.929 --> 35:51.464
Mate, no.

35:51.498 --> 35:52.866
Come on, Les.

35:52.898 --> 35:54.967
- I don't give a toss!
- Les...

35:55.000 --> 35:57.503
I don't give a toss what
your piece of paper said.

35:57.536 --> 35:59.372
- Can we get some...
- Alright, alright.

35:59.406 --> 36:01.542
- Come on, Les.
- We talked about this.

36:01.574 --> 36:03.310
Take your truck
and piss off!

36:03.342 --> 36:05.545
No, don't, don't!
Let... let go of me.

36:05.578 --> 36:08.214
- Don't, you bastards!
- It's alright.

36:08.248 --> 36:10.317
Let go of me!

36:10.350 --> 36:12.552
- Alright, can we just...
- Please!

36:12.585 --> 36:14.554
- We've talked about this.
- Please, I'm begging you.

36:14.587 --> 36:16.956
Please, don't take 'em, mate.

36:16.989 --> 36:19.826
They're mine! They're mine!

36:20.860 --> 36:22.062
No!

36:23.730 --> 36:26.099
No!

36:27.299 --> 36:29.368
They're mine!

36:53.326 --> 36:55.996
I hope boxing
doesn't run in the family.

37:00.100 --> 37:02.936
Yeah, go!

37:15.815 --> 37:17.618
Oh, Colin.

37:39.005 --> 37:41.008
Colin, I...

37:42.241 --> 37:44.677
Oh, no, that's not... No!

37:44.710 --> 37:46.846
You can't do that.
That's not on, that's not on.

37:46.880 --> 37:50.417
Over here, see this?
What do we, er... What do we...

37:50.449 --> 37:53.721
Can we... We've got
a situation here!

37:56.589 --> 37:58.926
You have to do what they say.

38:00.226 --> 38:02.696
Then in two years...

38:40.833 --> 38:43.102
- Col.
- Lionel.

38:43.136 --> 38:44.737
You right?

38:47.607 --> 38:48.909
Yeah.

38:52.045 --> 38:53.614
You just seen him?

38:54.413 --> 38:56.783
Yeah, he asked me
who my mob was.

39:00.453 --> 39:03.223
- Righto.
- Righto.

39:04.056 --> 39:06.659
So the good news is that
all the sheep that you...

39:06.692 --> 39:09.328
That were slaughtered,
uh, are covered.

39:09.362 --> 39:10.764
And you'll see here,

39:10.797 --> 39:12.833
this is what we call
product loss compensation.

39:12.866 --> 39:14.634
So that's based
on your average income

39:14.667 --> 39:16.302
over the last three years.

39:16.335 --> 39:17.603
Just in case
you're wondering, though,

39:17.636 --> 39:18.839
it's only a two-year deal.

39:18.871 --> 39:21.440
We're not gonna pay you
to do nothing forever.

39:24.177 --> 39:26.079
Um, and so if you comply

39:26.112 --> 39:27.581
with the soil-testing schedule,

39:27.614 --> 39:30.717
then after two years
you can apply to restock.

39:30.750 --> 39:32.219
But, er...

39:32.252 --> 39:35.822
Mm, yeah, absolutely
no more funny buggers.

39:36.755 --> 39:41.627
OK? You gotta follow
the rules, basically.

39:42.661 --> 39:47.634
Um, OK, any questions? Feedback?

39:47.667 --> 39:49.469
Feedback?

39:50.369 --> 39:52.371
Questions?

39:53.139 --> 39:54.374
Where do I sign?

39:54.406 --> 39:55.741
Oh, I just have to run you

39:55.775 --> 39:57.010
through all your other options.

39:57.043 --> 39:58.712
The buyback scheme
is actually quite generous.

39:58.744 --> 40:00.913
- I'm not selling up.
- Well, OK, but I do...

40:00.947 --> 40:03.550
- I am legally obliged to...
- I won't sell my land.

40:03.583 --> 40:05.652
I think you'll find
that if you have a look

40:05.685 --> 40:08.455
at the rate of compensation
being offered, it...

40:08.487 --> 40:10.422
Oh, no! Wow! OK, great.

40:10.456 --> 40:13.360
That's good. That's your
autograph down the bottom.

40:13.393 --> 40:15.795
Great. Oh, oh, there is
actually one other thing.

40:15.828 --> 40:18.130
I was wondering
if you could help us

40:18.163 --> 40:20.432
communicate with Les.

40:20.465 --> 40:23.369
- Les Grimurson.
- House next to mine.

40:23.402 --> 40:24.904
Yes, well, I mean,

40:24.938 --> 40:27.273
he's not really
communicating with us.

40:27.306 --> 40:29.176
Well, you're brothers,
aren't you?

40:29.208 --> 40:30.710
Yeah.

40:30.743 --> 40:33.380
No, we haven't spoken
either for...

40:34.179 --> 40:35.581
..quite a while now.

40:35.614 --> 40:37.417
Right, well, he needs to start

40:37.449 --> 40:39.919
decontaminating the shed, the...

40:39.953 --> 40:41.521
Everything, actually.

40:41.554 --> 40:43.389
I mean, if he doesn't
start burning soon,

40:43.422 --> 40:44.991
then it'll be summer.

40:45.023 --> 40:46.426
You see, in summer,

40:46.458 --> 40:48.761
it's a total fire ban
around here.

40:48.795 --> 40:50.563
No kidding.

40:51.364 --> 40:53.400
Soon. Well, not soon.
Now actually. ASAP.

40:53.433 --> 40:55.467
Otherwise, it's six months
until the end of summer.

40:55.500 --> 40:57.903
So if he doesn't start,
he'll hold everybody back.

40:57.936 --> 41:00.172
In six months, you,
everybody will be held back.

41:00.206 --> 41:01.541
And so you need...

41:01.574 --> 41:05.078
Well, we need
to communicate that to him.

41:05.110 --> 41:06.478
Thank you!

48:25.116 --> 48:27.119

48:27.152 --> 48:28.855
Oh, mate.

48:30.288 --> 48:33.125
Huh.

48:33.159 --> 48:35.927
- Sorry, mate.
- You smell that?

48:35.960 --> 48:38.964
Bloody...
..smells like sheep.

48:38.998 --> 48:41.367
Yeah, I can smell that.

- Yeah, mm.

48:49.342 --> 48:52.712

You know how it is.

48:55.246 --> 48:56.982

49:00.319 --> 49:02.322
You might want to put him
in the fridge, eh?

49:02.355 --> 49:03.990
- It's pretty whiffy.
- Yeah.

49:10.730 --> 49:12.764
You got any cool drinks
or anything?

49:12.797 --> 49:14.801
Nah, nah.

49:14.833 --> 49:16.902
Sorry, Lionel.

49:20.806 --> 49:22.375

49:22.407 --> 49:24.076

52:40.239 --> 52:42.475
Yeah, no, I... I'm not...
I'm not...

52:42.507 --> 52:45.810
I'm not really a wine drinker.

52:45.844 --> 52:47.679
OK.

52:48.681 --> 52:50.049
Noted.

52:51.049 --> 52:52.851
Um...

52:52.884 --> 52:55.220
Listen, I'm dying to see
what you've done in there.

52:55.253 --> 52:57.723
- What?!
- Your renos.

52:57.755 --> 53:00.292
Oh! Um...

53:00.326 --> 53:01.894
Ooh, what's Kip doing?

53:01.927 --> 53:03.629
What's she up to?

53:14.440 --> 53:17.476
Oh, my goodness!

53:17.509 --> 53:19.679
Oh, he's just drunk. That's all.

53:19.712 --> 53:21.547
Oh!

53:21.580 --> 53:24.417
He's burned to a crisp.

53:24.449 --> 53:26.018
He must've been
out here all day.

53:26.051 --> 53:27.853
- Could've been.
- Oh, God.

53:27.886 --> 53:30.422
He's absolutely on fire.

53:30.456 --> 53:33.493
Colin, help me.

53:34.360 --> 53:36.863
Oh...

53:38.931 --> 53:40.299
Oh, well.

53:40.331 --> 53:42.335
One, two...

53:42.368 --> 53:45.036
What are you doing?

53:45.069 --> 53:46.371
Let's take him to his place.

53:46.404 --> 53:48.940
No, Colin!
Yours is closer. Come on.

53:48.973 --> 53:50.742
Ooh!

53:50.775 --> 53:52.544
Ow.

53:53.344 --> 53:55.313
- Oh!
- Here.

53:55.346 --> 53:58.383
Oh, get off!

53:58.417 --> 54:00.587
Jesus Christ, Colin!

54:03.455 --> 54:05.958
It is ridiculous!

54:07.226 --> 54:10.463
I mean, what happened
with you two?

54:10.496 --> 54:12.365
He's your brother
and you can't even...

54:12.397 --> 54:15.200
You don't always
need things to happen.

54:15.234 --> 54:18.103
Peop...

54:18.136 --> 54:20.538
People are just... different.

54:20.572 --> 54:22.108
Oh-ho-ho!

54:24.877 --> 54:28.947
Yeah, well,
you're different, alright.

54:37.822 --> 54:38.991
Ohh...

54:45.230 --> 54:47.500
You wanna go
and wet some towels?

54:49.435 --> 54:52.237
Right, yeah.

54:52.270 --> 54:54.006
Yeah.

55:04.549 --> 55:06.384
Oh, that's it.

55:06.418 --> 55:08.454
Yeah. That's it, mate.

55:08.487 --> 55:10.356
Now go on, go on.

55:11.790 --> 55:15.027
Yes! Yeah, yeah.

55:15.060 --> 55:16.529
Yeah! Good.

55:16.561 --> 55:18.197
- You know, he's too hot.
- Huh?!

55:18.230 --> 55:21.634
I think we're just gonna have
to put him straight in the...

55:21.667 --> 55:23.168
..bath.

55:23.201 --> 55:25.071
Colin?

55:25.103 --> 55:28.040
Colin?

55:32.411 --> 55:34.380
Colin!

55:36.147 --> 55:37.783
Colin!

55:42.321 --> 55:44.357
Sorry, I was just, um...

55:45.156 --> 55:48.126
Yep. Yep.

55:49.127 --> 55:51.096
Righto.

55:51.130 --> 55:52.598
- I've got this.
- Yep.

55:52.630 --> 55:54.532
- Put this there. Yeah.
- Alright. Good.

55:54.565 --> 55:58.136
On his... on his head.
Yeah, he should be...

55:58.170 --> 55:59.805
He'll be right.

55:59.837 --> 56:01.706
Yeah.

56:01.739 --> 56:03.908
Oh, my God.

56:06.545 --> 56:09.215
Oh, yeah.

56:15.020 --> 56:18.690
Yeah, temperature's
coming down... at least.

56:18.723 --> 56:23.027
He'll just need to...
sleep off the booze now.

56:23.060 --> 56:24.896
Yeah.

56:30.902 --> 56:32.370
Yeah.

56:32.404 --> 56:33.906
Alright, um... um...

56:33.938 --> 56:35.808
Um...

56:35.840 --> 56:38.076
So...

56:38.110 --> 56:40.378
..thanks for popping by.

56:45.449 --> 56:47.685
Oh... bloody pipes again.

56:47.719 --> 56:50.188
You wouldn't believe
the plumbing in this place.

56:50.221 --> 56:53.959
So, um... how about that cuppa?

57:00.232 --> 57:02.735
Has he been
this bad before?

57:03.534 --> 57:05.538
Oh, a long time ago.

57:06.337 --> 57:08.507
But, yeah, oh, yeah.

57:10.241 --> 57:12.444
He had a bit of a...

57:12.476 --> 57:15.313
..bit of a rough trot
there for a while.

57:15.346 --> 57:17.582
Things weren't easy for him.

57:18.750 --> 57:21.521
Anyway, you don't want
to hear me rabbiting on.

57:24.822 --> 57:28.127
Sorry. I hope you
don't think I'm prying.

57:28.159 --> 57:30.629
No. No dramas.

57:32.431 --> 57:34.534
"No dramas."

57:35.366 --> 57:38.470
Oh, I used to love
how Australians said that.

57:40.772 --> 57:44.377
It's probably why I've travelled
halfway across the globe.

57:45.377 --> 57:47.346
"No dramas."

57:49.915 --> 57:51.750
Well...

57:52.884 --> 57:54.752
So why
did you come across...

57:54.786 --> 57:57.822
Sorry.
Don't feel you have to...

57:57.855 --> 58:01.726
I know I sounded mysterious.
It wasn't intentional.

58:01.759 --> 58:04.162
I hate it when people do that.

58:04.196 --> 58:06.464
Yeah, but I... I...

58:06.498 --> 58:08.634
I want to know about...

58:09.768 --> 58:11.403
..you and stuff.

58:21.078 --> 58:23.048
You've never...

58:29.554 --> 58:33.025
Have any women
ever made it out here?

58:34.025 --> 58:36.895
Yeah, one or two, but, um...

58:38.163 --> 58:40.465
..he'd scare them away.

58:42.167 --> 58:46.404
Plus the bag of rotten prawns
at the bottom of the stairs.

58:46.438 --> 58:48.907
That never helped much either.

1:01:39.444 --> 1:01:42.014
Alright, mate.

1:01:42.047 --> 1:01:45.117
Yeah. Oh.

1:01:46.118 --> 1:01:47.953
What a night, eh?

1:01:48.752 --> 1:01:52.356
A bit of drama, bit of romance.

1:01:54.159 --> 1:01:56.061
Eh?

1:02:12.409 --> 1:02:14.980
OK, pull.

1:02:15.013 --> 1:02:18.583
Hey!

1:02:18.616 --> 1:02:21.486
- What did you win?
- It's a...

1:02:23.154 --> 1:02:24.822
Oh.

1:02:24.855 --> 1:02:28.359
- It's a sheep.
- Yay.

1:02:31.163 --> 1:02:32.998
- Hi, Sally.
- Hey.

1:02:33.031 --> 1:02:35.199
- You're working here as well?
- Nah, just here.

1:02:35.232 --> 1:02:38.136
The timing's a little bit off
for becoming a vet nurse.

1:02:38.170 --> 1:02:40.139
Turns out you need
animals for that.

1:02:40.172 --> 1:02:43.175
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- What? Did Kat lay you off?

1:02:43.208 --> 1:02:44.576
No, no, no. It's not her fault.

1:02:44.609 --> 1:02:46.177
Actually, she's got something

1:02:46.210 --> 1:02:47.879
lined up for me
in Perth next year.

1:02:47.913 --> 1:02:50.048
Perth? How long for?

1:02:50.081 --> 1:02:51.650
Er, like, for long or are...

1:02:51.683 --> 1:02:53.284
No, you won't be back.

1:02:53.317 --> 1:02:54.719
Once you're used
to all the nightclubs,

1:02:54.752 --> 1:02:57.522
you'll be breaking hearts
all over the place, won't ya?

1:02:58.623 --> 1:03:01.326
OK, well, I'll be back
in a tick to take your order.

1:03:01.359 --> 1:03:03.027
Alright.

1:03:04.529 --> 1:03:06.732
Um, actually...

1:03:07.933 --> 1:03:09.967
..we're, um...

1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:11.435
We're moving on too.

1:03:11.469 --> 1:03:12.804
- Hey?
- What?

1:03:12.837 --> 1:03:15.773
I mean, for us,
it's take this offer now

1:03:15.806 --> 1:03:17.975
or hand over
to the banks later on.

1:03:18.009 --> 1:03:21.179
We don't really see it as
a choice, with all the debt.

1:03:21.212 --> 1:03:24.682
- Where you going?
- Katanning, for now.

1:03:24.715 --> 1:03:26.918
- Seasonal stuff.
- Katanning?

1:03:26.951 --> 1:03:28.352
You're working with merinos?

1:03:28.386 --> 1:03:29.755
We gotta do something,

1:03:29.788 --> 1:03:32.391
sitting around
for two years with no sheep.

1:03:33.190 --> 1:03:35.493
And that's if OJD
doesn't come back.

1:03:35.527 --> 1:03:37.696
- No, that's not gonna happen.
- Who says?

1:03:37.728 --> 1:03:39.797
The Pommy vet?
That Ag Department bloke?

1:03:39.831 --> 1:03:42.868
He wouldn't know his arse
from his farrr...

1:03:42.900 --> 1:03:44.402
..canal.

1:03:44.435 --> 1:03:47.171
Alright, girls,
why don't you go outside

1:03:47.205 --> 1:03:49.273
and play on the bouncy castle?

1:03:49.306 --> 1:03:50.641
Grrr!

1:03:54.378 --> 1:03:56.348
They had OJD in Tassie.

1:03:56.380 --> 1:03:59.918
Three times they slaughtered
in 10 years.

1:04:01.518 --> 1:04:04.089
I mean, maybe this
is the kick up the bum

1:04:04.121 --> 1:04:05.690
some of us need, you know?

1:04:05.723 --> 1:04:08.593
It's not like it's raining cash
with heritage breeds.

1:04:08.627 --> 1:04:11.697
But that's exactly why we need
to think outside the box.

1:04:11.730 --> 1:04:13.932
- You know, diversify.
- You and bloody llamas.

1:04:13.964 --> 1:04:16.200
Alpacas, mate. They're
alpacas. You know that.

1:04:16.234 --> 1:04:18.670
They're the only things that
made me a profit this year.

1:04:18.703 --> 1:04:21.840
- Righto. Settle down.
- I'm staying, for now at least.

1:04:21.873 --> 1:04:23.308
Been offered a job.

1:04:23.340 --> 1:04:24.875
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1:04:24.909 --> 1:04:27.713
Well, the Ag Department mob
cleared out and...

1:04:27.746 --> 1:04:30.682
But they still need
people to test and that.

1:04:30.714 --> 1:04:32.450
What, you're working
for them pricks?

1:04:32.484 --> 1:04:33.951
Mate, you're working
with merinos.

1:04:33.985 --> 1:04:36.321
At least they're sheep,
not bloody alpacas.

1:04:36.353 --> 1:04:38.656
- I mean llamas.
- Oh, shut up!

1:04:38.690 --> 1:04:40.525
- Don't get all cut.
- I'm done with you.

1:04:40.558 --> 1:04:42.094
You're always pushing
and giving me grief

1:04:42.127 --> 1:04:43.494
just 'cause I'm giving it a go.

1:04:43.527 --> 1:04:44.730
- You're all cut, are you?
- Yeah!

1:04:44.763 --> 1:04:46.665
At least I'm trying, mate.
Look at you.

1:04:46.697 --> 1:04:49.533
What do you do? You give up!
I mean, think of your kids.

1:04:49.567 --> 1:04:51.369
- You're bloody gutless!
- Now, boys...

1:04:51.402 --> 1:04:54.372
Stop it, boys. Boys!

1:04:54.406 --> 1:04:56.275
Fergo, sit down!

1:04:56.308 --> 1:04:59.878
Let's not do this.
Let's just not.

1:05:00.978 --> 1:05:02.413
Sit down.

1:05:11.623 --> 1:05:13.992
We haven't made a decision yet.

1:05:14.025 --> 1:05:15.827
Let's just be honest.

1:05:15.860 --> 1:05:19.231
People are gonna leave.
You can't blame 'em.

1:05:19.264 --> 1:05:20.732
And then what?

1:05:20.764 --> 1:05:23.668
No more footy team,
no more fire crew.

1:05:23.701 --> 1:05:26.537
I mean, huh, no more fire crew!

1:05:29.406 --> 1:05:31.876
What are we gonna do
next Christmas?

1:05:33.143 --> 1:05:34.645
If Lionel has to move away,

1:05:34.679 --> 1:05:37.349
then we'll be struggling
to find a Santa Claus.

1:05:39.384 --> 1:05:41.853
Oh, I don't know about that.

1:06:57.761 --> 1:06:59.163
Hmph!

1:07:17.815 --> 1:07:22.020
Oh, just the man
I'm looking for. Ha!

1:07:24.889 --> 1:07:28.527
OK. Er, that's $81.60.

1:07:30.627 --> 1:07:32.196
- Thank you.
- Merry Christmas.

1:07:32.230 --> 1:07:33.932
Yep.

1:07:36.134 --> 1:07:37.936
You're a hard man
to get hold of.

1:07:37.969 --> 1:07:39.838
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1:07:39.871 --> 1:07:41.773
I tried calling,

1:07:41.806 --> 1:07:44.876
tried popping in,
a couple of times.

1:07:44.909 --> 1:07:46.378
Oh, yeah?

1:07:47.177 --> 1:07:49.114
Righto.

1:07:49.147 --> 1:07:50.748
I was, um...

1:07:50.781 --> 1:07:52.216
Oh, I'll be back.

1:07:52.250 --> 1:07:54.518
Oh, actually, do you mind, um,

1:07:54.552 --> 1:07:57.055
the goats cheese,
just pop it in the fridge?

1:07:57.087 --> 1:07:58.556
Just, yeah... Wait.

1:07:58.589 --> 1:08:01.492
Yeah, just until I...
come back.

1:08:05.964 --> 1:08:07.666
Uh, like I was... Oh, sorry.

1:08:07.699 --> 1:08:10.235
Like I was saying, Mr Grimurson,
I need to talk to you.

1:08:10.268 --> 1:08:11.770
- Were ya?
- Sorry?

1:08:11.802 --> 1:08:13.804
I don't remember
you saying that.

1:08:13.837 --> 1:08:15.673
It's this business
with your brother.

1:08:15.706 --> 1:08:17.609
I'm sure you know he hasn't
really been cooperative.

1:08:17.642 --> 1:08:20.111
And it's a bit of a worry,
to be honest. A real worry.

1:08:20.143 --> 1:08:22.481
He's the only one who hasn't
cleaned, hasn't burned a thing,

1:08:22.513 --> 1:08:24.181
and he's gonna set
the whole valley back.

1:08:24.214 --> 1:08:25.516
Well, you know this.

1:08:25.549 --> 1:08:27.918
Anyway, the thing is
I checked the papers

1:08:27.951 --> 1:08:31.956
and as far as we can see,
Les doesn't own his land.

1:08:33.557 --> 1:08:35.726
It's entirely in your name.

1:08:42.200 --> 1:08:44.236
Would you care to...

1:08:44.268 --> 1:08:46.905
You know,
what's that about, then?

1:08:52.243 --> 1:08:56.048
Dad left the farm to me,
only me.

1:08:57.514 --> 1:09:01.485
But before Mum died,
I promised her that...

1:09:01.518 --> 1:09:04.188
..Les could live
in the old house.

1:09:04.222 --> 1:09:05.891
So...

1:09:06.990 --> 1:09:10.528
Well, how did he end up
with half the bloody...

1:09:14.365 --> 1:09:16.001
Right.

1:09:17.168 --> 1:09:19.304
OK, I've tried to be...

1:09:19.337 --> 1:09:21.639
..you know,
about the whole thing,

1:09:21.673 --> 1:09:26.311
but this means that
you're responsible for him.

1:09:26.343 --> 1:09:28.279
If he doesn't want
to follow the rules,

1:09:28.312 --> 1:09:30.581
it's you that's...

1:09:32.417 --> 1:09:34.252
When I fill the forms out,

1:09:34.285 --> 1:09:37.122
it won't be his name on there.

1:09:39.190 --> 1:09:41.026
It'll be yours is what I mean.

1:09:41.058 --> 1:09:42.793
- Yeah, mate, I got it.
- OK.

1:09:42.826 --> 1:09:47.365
You wanna keep the farm?
Talk to your brother.

1:10:11.088 --> 1:10:15.493
Where you gone, Kip? Kip, Kip?

1:10:16.561 --> 1:10:19.097
Oh, yeah.
Good dog. Come here.

1:10:20.263 --> 1:10:23.868
Take this to Les, can you?
Take it to Les.

1:10:23.901 --> 1:10:25.837
Go on. Les.

1:10:30.975 --> 1:10:33.277
Oh, shit.

1:10:33.311 --> 1:10:34.879
Wait. WAIT!

1:10:34.911 --> 1:10:36.615
Kip!

1:10:50.128 --> 1:10:51.763
Ahh!

1:10:53.397 --> 1:10:56.433
Here you are, girls.

1:10:56.467 --> 1:10:58.503
You're gonna love this.

1:10:59.303 --> 1:11:01.106
Oi!

1:11:02.874 --> 1:11:06.211
Oi! Col!

1:11:07.745 --> 1:11:11.683
Oi! What's all this crap?

1:11:12.683 --> 1:11:14.018
Hey?

1:11:16.387 --> 1:11:19.691
What do you think,
you can tell me what to do?

1:11:19.723 --> 1:11:22.628
Eh? Eh?

1:11:23.428 --> 1:11:26.632
That's not how it works,
little brother.

1:11:38.109 --> 1:11:40.379
Open the door
or I'll kick it in!

1:11:41.411 --> 1:11:43.714
You think I'm gonna
listen to you?

1:11:43.748 --> 1:11:47.686
You think I'm gonna listen
to you, ya weak prick?

1:11:49.520 --> 1:11:51.388
You know what you can do
with your letter?

1:11:51.422 --> 1:11:54.759
You can wipe your arse
with your bloody letter!

1:11:56.893 --> 1:11:59.364
You weak prick.

1:12:08.673 --> 1:12:11.476
It's not yours. It's mine!

1:12:12.410 --> 1:12:14.479
It's mine!

1:12:18.249 --> 1:12:20.452
Daddy's little boy.

1:12:21.819 --> 1:12:23.455
Ya prick.

1:12:24.588 --> 1:12:27.424
He was always a weak prick.

1:14:43.160 --> 1:14:44.830
Hmm.

1:14:59.776 --> 1:15:02.145
Oh!

1:15:13.057 --> 1:15:15.593
Er, Mr Grimurson?

1:15:15.625 --> 1:15:17.328
Ahh!

1:15:17.361 --> 1:15:19.030
Mr Grimurson!

1:15:19.062 --> 1:15:21.732
Sorry, I just, er...

1:15:22.600 --> 1:15:25.503
Mum said to tell you that
he's got alcohol withdrawal,

1:15:25.535 --> 1:15:28.138
that he'll be in there
another week maybe.

1:15:29.440 --> 1:15:31.142
You know, I can give you a hand.

1:15:31.174 --> 1:15:32.610
Not with the...

1:15:32.642 --> 1:15:35.212
With the shed. I mean,
you know, the clean-up.

1:15:35.245 --> 1:15:38.382
Not the... God.

1:15:40.851 --> 1:15:42.754
A week, you say?

1:15:44.120 --> 1:15:45.923
Nah, I'll be right. I can do it.

1:15:45.956 --> 1:15:47.758
Yeah, yeah.

1:15:49.060 --> 1:15:50.762
Hey, um...

1:15:52.362 --> 1:15:54.798
You're not leavin', right?

1:15:55.799 --> 1:15:57.302
Taking an offer?

1:15:57.334 --> 1:15:59.069
What do you reckon?

1:15:59.102 --> 1:16:01.306
Um... no?

1:16:01.338 --> 1:16:04.107
Yeah, I... I don't
wanna leave either.

1:16:04.141 --> 1:16:06.110
But everyone else
is moving to Perth.

1:16:06.142 --> 1:16:08.980
Oh, not just Perth. I mean,
people are moving everywhere.

1:16:09.012 --> 1:16:11.381
Some people are going
to Perth, not all, just...

1:16:11.414 --> 1:16:13.618
People who want
to be vet nurses.

1:16:16.520 --> 1:16:19.156
Yeah, anyway, I just, er...

1:16:19.190 --> 1:16:21.593
..I just wish things
were normal again.

1:16:24.527 --> 1:16:27.298
Look, um...

1:16:28.098 --> 1:16:31.136
That support beam in there,
maybe it is a two-man job.

1:16:32.136 --> 1:16:33.603
Yeah. All good.

1:16:33.637 --> 1:16:35.306
I'll see you tomorrow, then?

1:16:35.338 --> 1:16:36.873
Yeah.

1:16:36.906 --> 1:16:40.779
Um... up here,
not down at my place.

1:16:42.146 --> 1:16:43.982
Yeah, all good.

1:16:52.255 --> 1:16:53.725
There you go,
nice cup of tea.

1:16:53.758 --> 1:16:55.193
<i>..bushfires

Hey, mate.

- Ta, love.
- Yep. See you, Les.

1:21:14.517 --> 1:21:16.520
Alright, girls.

1:21:34.737 --> 1:21:37.874
I reckon you might have
a couple on the go there.

1:21:39.310 --> 1:21:41.713
And how about you, my love?

1:21:43.047 --> 1:21:45.415
Oh, yeah, you too, eh?

1:22:09.673 --> 1:22:11.542
Mate, I'm proud of you.

1:22:11.575 --> 1:22:13.678
All the girls are up the duff.

1:22:13.710 --> 1:22:16.246
It's a good job. Well done.

1:22:16.280 --> 1:22:20.284
And now that's it for you,
OK? Put it away.

1:22:20.316 --> 1:22:22.986

OK, mate,
you gotta make this last.

1:23:11.368 --> 1:23:12.803
I might be a while.

1:23:12.835 --> 1:23:15.806
<i>..mobilised

1:23:15.838 --> 1:23:17.975
<i>The biggest threat to

<i>Do not attempt to evacuate

<i>are no longer safe.</i>

1:23:32.923 --> 1:23:35.793
The back-burn here's
been great. Good work.

1:23:35.825 --> 1:23:38.561
Now, the wind's not
a huge problem right now,

1:23:38.594 --> 1:23:40.563
but you know what it's like.

1:23:40.597 --> 1:23:42.833
It can crank up, get gusty.

1:23:42.865 --> 1:23:47.003
Jackson, mate, you gotta
prime that back-up tank.

1:23:47.036 --> 1:23:50.007
Right, Col, just keep
goin' on this flank.

1:23:50.039 --> 1:23:51.307
- Thanks.
- Right.

1:23:51.340 --> 1:23:53.244
Alright, you two,
I know it's tempting,

1:23:53.276 --> 1:23:55.346
but don't go too deep
along this section.

1:23:55.379 --> 1:23:57.047
We've got 10,
maybe 15 minutes, right?

1:23:57.079 --> 1:23:59.015
Buddy up, stay hydrated.

1:23:59.048 --> 1:24:00.381
- Did you catch that?
- Nup.

1:24:00.383 --> 1:24:03.219
Albany crew's
caught on the old road.

1:24:03.253 --> 1:24:04.755
We're not gonna stop this one.

1:24:04.788 --> 1:24:08.426
But with our back-burn here
along this wedge,

1:24:08.459 --> 1:24:10.828
we might be able to stop it
getting to town, maybe.

1:24:10.861 --> 1:24:12.129
OK. You good?

1:24:12.161 --> 1:24:14.365
- Yeah, I'm good.
- Alright, good.

1:24:15.932 --> 1:24:17.801
Come on.

1:24:17.834 --> 1:24:21.571
I'm down to 416 on Marion,
416 on Marion.

1:24:21.605 --> 1:24:23.840
Chuck it in the side,
spin it 'round.

1:24:35.486 --> 1:24:39.123
It's madness him being here.
When did he get back?

1:24:39.923 --> 1:24:43.928
I'm not sure.
Maybe... maybe this morning.

1:24:47.897 --> 1:24:49.400
I don't know.

1:24:49.432 --> 1:24:52.368
Well, keep an eye
on him, eh? Silly bugger.

1:24:52.401 --> 1:24:54.838
It's gonna get worse
before it gets better.

1:25:11.454 --> 1:25:13.723
<i>All units, fall back</i>

1:25:13.757 --> 1:25:16.026

<i>All units, fall back!</i>

1:26:25.195 --> 1:26:27.231
I know what you got
in your house.

1:26:27.263 --> 1:26:28.833
They're mine!

1:26:29.833 --> 1:26:31.569
You stay away.

1:26:46.016 --> 1:26:47.752
Stay away!

1:27:04.101 --> 1:27:06.170
When did he get here?

1:27:06.203 --> 1:27:07.838
I dunno.

1:27:07.870 --> 1:27:10.206
I only saw him, like,
a couple hours in.

1:27:11.874 --> 1:27:14.444
Righto, everyone,
I just spoke to Regional.

1:27:14.477 --> 1:27:17.213
They're still at it
up the coast,

1:27:17.246 --> 1:27:18.682
but with the wind change,

1:27:18.714 --> 1:27:21.250
it doesn't look like it'll
flare up this end again.

1:27:21.284 --> 1:27:22.518
Everyone, pack it in.

1:27:22.552 --> 1:27:24.955
Let's see you back here
tomorrow for mop-up.

1:27:24.987 --> 1:27:26.289
Well done.

1:27:26.322 --> 1:27:28.792
Righto.

1:27:28.825 --> 1:27:32.129
Hey, Col, I reckon you
should just take it easy.

1:27:32.161 --> 1:27:34.964
No, no, I'm good. Thanks, mate.

1:27:46.308 --> 1:27:47.978
Think he's alright?

1:27:49.212 --> 1:27:50.947
Old fellas like that...

1:27:52.115 --> 1:27:53.550
The way he's looking,

1:27:53.583 --> 1:27:55.819
sniff a bit of burnt toast
tomorrow morning

1:27:55.852 --> 1:27:57.821
and, bang, gone.

1:27:57.853 --> 1:27:59.123
You reckon?

1:28:00.123 --> 1:28:02.326
Nah, mate. Just sayin'.

1:28:27.116 --> 1:28:29.319
Oh, good, good...

1:28:57.414 --> 1:29:00.484
<i>All Kalgan
River firefighting units</i>

1:29:00.517 --> 1:29:03.320
<i>report to Woogenellup Road North
for mop-up.</i>

1:29:03.352 --> 1:29:05.755
<i>Repeat, all Kalgan River
firefighting units</i>

1:29:05.789 --> 1:29:09.026
<i>report to Woogenellup Road
North for mop-up.</i>

1:29:12.495 --> 1:29:14.464
<i>All Kalgan River
firefighting units</i>

1:29:14.498 --> 1:29:18.302
<i>report to Woogenellup Road
North for mop-up.</i>

1:29:18.334 --> 1:29:20.670
<i>Repeat, all Kalgan River
firefighting units</i>

1:29:20.704 --> 1:29:23.607
<i>report to Woogenellup Road
North for mop-up.</i>

1:29:23.639 --> 1:29:25.642
<i>Over.</i>

1:29:36.986 --> 1:29:39.522
Oh, for the love of God.

1:29:43.459 --> 1:29:47.297
Kat, I can't chat.
I'm sorry, I'm... I'm...

1:29:47.329 --> 1:29:49.932
Yeah, heard about yesterday.

1:29:49.965 --> 1:29:51.301
How are you faring?

1:29:51.334 --> 1:29:53.203
Yeah, nah, I'm, er...

1:29:53.236 --> 1:29:55.740
I'm fine.

1:29:56.539 --> 1:30:00.109
Thought so.
Thought I'd pop over anyway.

1:30:00.142 --> 1:30:01.846
- Yeah.
- Hey.

1:30:04.815 --> 1:30:07.651
I reckon you could
do with one.

1:30:07.683 --> 1:30:10.186
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm right. Thanks.

1:30:10.219 --> 1:30:12.321
Oh, Colin,
give yourself a break

1:30:12.355 --> 1:30:14.290
after what you
went through yesterday.

1:30:14.324 --> 1:30:16.627
Oh, for Christ's sake, Kat!

1:30:19.295 --> 1:30:21.632
I just... I just don't want you

1:30:21.664 --> 1:30:24.400
checking up on me
all the bloody time.

1:30:37.646 --> 1:30:39.749
You selfish old bastard.

1:30:39.782 --> 1:30:42.553
You are sick of me
checking up on you

1:30:42.585 --> 1:30:44.320
all the time, are you?

1:30:44.353 --> 1:30:47.391
Asking how you are,
if you're OK?

1:30:47.423 --> 1:30:50.293
Well, I'm just fine,
I'm bloody fine,

1:30:50.326 --> 1:30:51.727
in case you were wondering.

1:30:51.761 --> 1:30:54.498
I'm... I'm tickety-boo.
You know, no dramas here.

1:30:54.530 --> 1:30:56.600
Why would there be?

1:30:59.335 --> 1:31:01.571
God, I'm an idiot.

1:31:01.605 --> 1:31:03.040
What is wrong with me?

1:31:03.072 --> 1:31:06.877
I wanted someone to talk to
and who do I turn to?

1:31:06.910 --> 1:31:08.612
A mute.

1:31:09.411 --> 1:31:11.514
You can't even talk
to your own brother

1:31:11.548 --> 1:31:13.183
and he's right there.

1:31:13.215 --> 1:31:15.518
He's just there.

1:31:16.319 --> 1:31:18.388
Oh, God, what did I...

1:31:18.420 --> 1:31:20.089
You're a sad old man

1:31:20.123 --> 1:31:23.160
and all you can think about
is your dead bloody sheep.

1:31:23.192 --> 1:31:24.994
And it's not even...

1:31:25.794 --> 1:31:29.065
You're not ever,
ever gonna change.

1:31:29.098 --> 1:31:30.834
I wanted to!

1:31:32.435 --> 1:31:35.472
I didn't wanna be this...

1:31:36.839 --> 1:31:38.741
..sad...

1:31:54.891 --> 1:31:58.027
That's one
hell of a fire, isn't it?

1:31:59.029 --> 1:32:00.664
Yeah.

1:32:02.331 --> 1:32:04.133
You know, my grandfather spent

1:32:04.167 --> 1:32:06.102
his first few summers up there.

1:32:06.902 --> 1:32:09.338
Just a few head of stock.
Pretty tough country.

1:32:09.371 --> 1:32:13.209
That's why they reckon
our bloodline's so strong.

1:32:13.977 --> 1:32:16.814
That's the sheep, obviously.

1:32:17.614 --> 1:32:19.415
Oh, I don't know.

1:32:19.449 --> 1:32:23.020
You're doing alright...
for an old fella.

1:32:29.558 --> 1:32:31.861
The thing is he went
up there with his sheep

1:32:31.895 --> 1:32:33.964
because there'd been
a fire through there

1:32:33.996 --> 1:32:35.331
not long before.

1:32:35.365 --> 1:32:36.833
Big fire, all along the ridge,

1:32:36.865 --> 1:32:39.069
down to the beach
on the other side.

1:32:40.704 --> 1:32:42.973
He knew that after a fire,

1:32:43.005 --> 1:32:45.976
green shoots everywhere,
the bush is never lost.

1:32:53.650 --> 1:32:57.054
Is this still the same fire,
the smoke?

1:32:57.087 --> 1:32:59.056
Yeah, the wind's changed.

1:33:17.874 --> 1:33:21.011
Oh, bloody wallabies.
They'll overrun the place.

1:33:24.047 --> 1:33:25.514
Colin...

1:33:28.017 --> 1:33:30.386
Better get a wriggle-on, eh?

1:33:38.460 --> 1:33:40.364
You kept some.

1:33:43.932 --> 1:33:45.668
In your house!

1:33:45.701 --> 1:33:46.736
Oh!

1:33:51.540 --> 1:33:53.409
Kat, what are you doing?

1:33:55.145 --> 1:33:56.713
No.

1:33:56.745 --> 1:33:58.047
You stay there.

1:33:58.080 --> 1:34:00.116
No.

1:34:01.551 --> 1:34:04.454
They're not infected.
They're fine.

1:34:04.486 --> 1:34:07.757
Kat, please, please, please.

1:34:07.790 --> 1:34:09.726
I had to.

1:34:09.758 --> 1:34:11.462
I know you did.

1:34:13.029 --> 1:34:14.897
I know you did.

1:35:18.761 --> 1:35:21.764
Yeah, I'm on call today.
Fire and shit.

1:35:24.868 --> 1:35:26.402
You what?!

1:36:45.914 --> 1:36:47.618
Hey.

1:37:42.504 --> 1:37:44.340
Mr Grimurson,

1:37:44.374 --> 1:37:47.010
I've been authorised
to inspect your property.

1:37:47.776 --> 1:37:49.645
Just have a look through
this approval form...

1:37:49.678 --> 1:37:51.013
He gets it!

1:38:16.438 --> 1:38:18.475
Is it true?

1:38:39.329 --> 1:38:41.031
No sheep.

1:38:41.063 --> 1:38:43.834
A lot of air freshener, though.
Did you notice that?

1:38:45.034 --> 1:38:48.938
What's all that about, huh,
all the air freshener?

1:39:01.017 --> 1:39:02.886
Where are they, Colin?

1:39:12.261 --> 1:39:13.897
Nup, nothin'.

1:39:15.597 --> 1:39:17.868
You smell all that
air freshener?

1:39:20.035 --> 1:39:21.603
That's not a coincidence.

1:39:21.637 --> 1:39:24.741
Search the property,
every last inch.

1:39:29.812 --> 1:39:32.248
- You didn't know about this?
- Excuse me?

1:39:32.280 --> 1:39:35.551
You and him, you're... friendly.

1:39:36.352 --> 1:39:38.121
No, I did not know about this.

1:39:38.154 --> 1:39:39.656
Well, either way,
he's done it now.

1:39:39.688 --> 1:39:42.691
Violation of the terms.
He'll lose this place.

1:39:42.725 --> 1:39:44.893
He thinks he can hide it
with some air freshener

1:39:44.927 --> 1:39:46.161
like no-one would notice?

1:39:46.195 --> 1:39:47.530
First thing I noticed.

1:39:47.562 --> 1:39:50.100
Did you really have to?

1:39:50.133 --> 1:39:52.435
I mean, the whole valley?

1:39:52.468 --> 1:39:54.905
- Every last one?
- Yes!

1:39:56.472 --> 1:39:59.409
This is the way, I mean...

1:39:59.441 --> 1:40:01.310
I'm not the bad guy.

1:40:01.343 --> 1:40:03.712
OJD, that's the bad guy.

1:40:03.745 --> 1:40:04.980
We're the...

1:40:05.013 --> 1:40:06.482
And him, he's...

1:40:06.516 --> 1:40:08.317
He's the bad guy.
We're trying...

1:40:08.351 --> 1:40:11.955
We need to get rid of this
disease and he's just...

1:40:12.954 --> 1:40:15.091
I think I've been pretty...

1:40:16.092 --> 1:40:17.861
And everyone's just...

1:40:20.996 --> 1:40:24.100
We find those sheep, he is done!

1:40:54.830 --> 1:40:56.365
I think I might have
an interesting

1:40:56.398 --> 1:40:58.066
development over here.

1:40:58.100 --> 1:40:59.770
Over.

1:41:01.603 --> 1:41:04.973
I said I think I might have
an interesting develop...

1:41:26.361 --> 1:41:27.830
<i>Vehicle 1 to control.</i>

1:41:27.864 --> 1:41:29.965
<i>It's Wilson here.
You trying to reach me, Boss?</i>

1:41:33.503 --> 1:41:35.806
<i>Boss, you there? It's Wilson.</i>

1:42:03.965 --> 1:42:06.469
Mad bastard.

1:42:10.239 --> 1:42:11.741
Hang on.

1:42:14.744 --> 1:42:16.446
Is that...?

1:42:16.478 --> 1:42:19.382
- He's with...
- Les?

1:42:19.414 --> 1:42:21.984
Bloody hell!

1:42:24.419 --> 1:42:26.355
Still burning up there.

1:42:26.388 --> 1:42:28.525
It's dangerous, isn't it?

1:42:29.357 --> 1:42:30.826
Yeah.

1:42:39.768 --> 1:42:42.905
You getting the boss on
the radio? Can't get him.

1:42:44.039 --> 1:42:46.042
Your boss, not mine.

1:42:47.543 --> 1:42:50.880
Yeah, nah. Maybe he's back
at the house, eh?

1:42:59.821 --> 1:43:01.657
Huh! Mad bastards.

1:43:10.633 --> 1:43:12.802
Get up. Get up, Kip!

1:43:12.834 --> 1:43:15.771
Get up, Kip. Hup, hup!

1:43:15.804 --> 1:43:17.507
Hup, hup. Hup-hup!

1:43:17.539 --> 1:43:21.076
- Whey!
- Come on!

1:43:21.110 --> 1:43:22.612
Come on!

1:43:24.981 --> 1:43:27.282
Hup, hup, hup!

1:43:31.954 --> 1:43:35.659
Get behind! Hup!

1:43:55.777 --> 1:43:57.446
Ah.

1:44:36.951 --> 1:44:38.655
I suppose you've been joined

1:44:38.687 --> 1:44:40.956
with these ladies already, eh?

1:44:43.325 --> 1:44:45.662
Huh... Ooh, yeah.

1:44:46.462 --> 1:44:49.566
Oh, you're a fine ram.

1:44:50.465 --> 1:44:51.935
A fine ram.

1:44:54.102 --> 1:44:56.138
Righto, Kip.

1:44:56.172 --> 1:44:58.375
Let's get a wriggle-on.

1:45:02.611 --> 1:45:05.014
Get up!

1:45:05.047 --> 1:45:08.017
Get up! Up-hup-hup.

1:45:11.387 --> 1:45:14.891
Get up, get up! Get back, Kip.

1:45:16.892 --> 1:45:19.095
- Whoop! Whoop!
- Hey-up!

1:45:33.776 --> 1:45:36.813
Good dog. Get up, Kip.

1:45:40.715 --> 1:45:43.218
Get up, Kip.

1:45:47.956 --> 1:45:49.526
Here!

1:46:00.002 --> 1:46:01.870
What do you reckon?

1:46:02.905 --> 1:46:04.507
The wind's changed.

1:46:04.539 --> 1:46:06.308
Head to the beach.

1:46:08.076 --> 1:46:12.347
Get up, Kip.
Hup, hup, hup, hup-hup.

1:47:16.011 --> 1:47:17.612
Hold, Kip. Hold, Kip.

1:47:17.646 --> 1:47:19.415
Good dog.

1:47:35.530 --> 1:47:36.932
Bugger me!

1:47:38.467 --> 1:47:40.536
See if we can lift it.

1:47:46.475 --> 1:47:49.712
One more.

1:47:49.745 --> 1:47:51.648
It's stuck!

1:47:58.454 --> 1:48:00.389
Well, shit.

1:48:01.190 --> 1:48:03.159
Kip!

1:48:03.191 --> 1:48:05.160
Kip, get around, get around!

1:48:05.194 --> 1:48:06.896
Bring 'em back. Kip, Kip.

1:48:06.928 --> 1:48:08.630
Come on, bring 'em back!

1:48:08.664 --> 1:48:11.167
Bring 'em down, Kip.
Bring 'em down.

1:48:11.200 --> 1:48:12.401
Les!

1:48:12.433 --> 1:48:15.038
Les!

1:48:22.244 --> 1:48:23.580
Col?!

1:48:27.782 --> 1:48:29.352
Col?

1:48:44.667 --> 1:48:46.369
Oh, shit.

1:48:52.574 --> 1:48:54.410
Col!

1:49:06.821 --> 1:49:08.423
Col!

1:49:21.770 --> 1:49:23.606
Col!

1:49:53.334 --> 1:49:55.136
Col?

1:49:55.169 --> 1:49:57.706
Col, come on, mate.

1:49:59.307 --> 1:50:01.276
Col?

1:50:01.310 --> 1:50:03.012
It's Les.

1:50:05.414 --> 1:50:07.483
It's Les, mate.

1:50:16.959 --> 1:50:18.528
Arggh!

1:50:29.137 --> 1:50:30.739
Ohh!

1:50:34.910 --> 1:50:36.979
Oh.

1:50:38.513 --> 1:50:41.583
Come on, mate. One more.

1:51:02.570 --> 1:51:05.807
You're right, mate.
You're right.

1:51:06.808 --> 1:51:08.378
I gotcha.

1:51:09.178 --> 1:51:11.213
Ah...

1:51:11.245 --> 1:51:14.049
Everything's gonna be OK.

1:51:15.417 --> 1:51:16.886
You'll see.

1:51:25.994 --> 1:51:27.730
You'll be right.

1:51:28.530 --> 1:51:30.532
You'll be right, mate.

1:51:31.999 --> 1:51:34.436
Everything's gonna be OK.

1:51:36.871 --> 1:51:38.708
Oh, mate.

1:51:42.611 --> 1:51:45.415
Everything's gonna be OK.

1:52:14.942 --> 1:52:16.712
Thank you.

1:52:18.880 --> 1:52:22.051
Yeah, these are
all looking great...

1:52:23.051 --> 1:52:24.320
..for merinos.

1:52:24.352 --> 1:52:27.222
Well, they mightn't
look like much now,

1:52:27.255 --> 1:52:30.026
but with 100-odd years
of breeding...

1:52:30.825 --> 1:52:33.361
..they'll still be
rubbish bloody merinos.

1:52:33.395 --> 1:52:36.132
Oh, you never know.

1:52:38.534 --> 1:52:41.770
One day, a long-lost flock
of Kalgan Horns

1:52:41.803 --> 1:52:46.109
might just come...
wandering out of the bush.

1:52:48.276 --> 1:52:50.413
You never know.

1:52:53.248 --> 1:52:54.717
You never know.

1:52:54.749 --> 1:52:58.286
- Yeah, I reckon.
- Definitely. Yeah.

1:53:26.280 --> 1:53:29.751
Yep.

1:54:13.794 --> 1:54:15.431
Oh, yeah.

1:54:17.531 --> 1:54:20.302
Oh, that's a good boy.
