00:29.921 --> 00:31.716
When is our food going to get here?

00:31.753 --> 00:32.811
I'm starved!

00:32.857 --> 00:36.547
I'm so bored, I figured out where 
there wallpaper pattern repeats.

00:36.797 --> 00:40.092
See, it goes ship's wheel, 
popeye tattoo, gilligan hat,

00:40.239 --> 00:42.772
fish with boobs and back to ship's wheel.

00:43.080 --> 00:44.528
What about this swordfish?

00:45.051 --> 00:47.905
My life's work ruined!

00:48.308 --> 00:50.115
Yar, sorry about the delay.

00:50.189 --> 00:53.230
The chef is having a bit of a 
problem with tonight's special.

00:55.742 --> 00:59.956
Meanwhile, I can send a busboy out 
to get you something from a better

00:59.990 --> 01:00.652
restaurant.

01:00.700 --> 01:01.813
Red lobster?

01:01.983 --> 01:02.977
Not that good.

01:04.113 --> 01:08.685
Until then, perhaps an old sea 
yarn might pass the time.

01:11.861 --> 01:13.575
Too bad I don't know any.

01:13.683 --> 01:17.567
I know one about the most important 
sea voyage in american history:

01:17.650 --> 01:19.635
The journey of the mayflower.

01:19.690 --> 01:23.758
Yes, the ship that brought 
prostitutes to America.

01:23.822 --> 01:26.465
Not prostitutes, protestants.

01:26.582 --> 01:28.838
Now who's being naive?

01:29.081 --> 01:31.306
The year was 1620.

01:36.382 --> 01:38.217
Hurry, my little puritans.

01:38.290 --> 01:42.765
We must flee England and its 
insufficiently puritanical ways.

01:42.990 --> 01:44.915
Do you have your shipboard entertainments?

01:45.030 --> 01:46.746
I've got my toy wood lump.

01:48.383 --> 01:49.787
what jolly fun.

01:50.621 --> 01:53.326
Finally, we shall bid good-bye to England

01:53.381 --> 01:56.036
and its drunken, decadent sinners.

01:57.201 --> 01:59.735
Out of my way, you god-fearing buckleheads!

02:02.273 --> 02:03.165
Hide me!

02:04.333 --> 02:05.776
Please, you got to help me.

02:05.850 --> 02:07.578
If they find me, they'll kill me.

02:07.831 --> 02:09.697
Has anyone seen this knave?

02:09.882 --> 02:12.446
He's wanted for daring to 
question why we call this

02:12.493 --> 02:16.115
the jacobean era when the king's 
name is James and not Jacob.

02:16.230 --> 02:17.006
Oh, lord, I beseech you....

02:17.471 --> 02:19.438
Mother, we must protect him.

02:19.540 --> 02:21.326
Look, he's praying.

02:21.460 --> 02:25.216
Oh, lord, please let the soldiers 
kill this family instead of me.

02:25.541 --> 02:30.525
Noble sir, you may accompany us to 
America in my late husband's clothing.

02:30.573 --> 02:34.087
And I will make thee a hat from construction paper.

02:34.523 --> 02:36.646
So thou art a widow?

02:36.660 --> 02:40.515
Then the codpiece holds no terrors for thee.

02:40.581 --> 02:44.178
Good sir, I do not approve of your fleshly gaze.

02:48.430 --> 02:49.275
Baby.

02:51.260 --> 02:52.148
Good-bye!

02:52.161 --> 02:53.437
Don't come back!

02:54.890 --> 02:56.646
What kind of a booze cruise is this?

02:56.701 --> 02:57.807
Where's the hooch?

02:57.920 --> 03:01.146
We puritans have no place for drunkenness...

03:01.173 --> 03:04.078
or colorful clothes or dreaming or poetry.

03:04.112 --> 03:06.797
So if you write a sonnet, 
keep it under your bonnet.

03:06.850 --> 03:09.246
Oh, no! That was a poem!

03:11.312 --> 03:12.915
Forgive me, lord!

03:13.850 --> 03:15.627
Then pour a little salt in the wounds.

03:16.390 --> 03:17.266
And I'm good.

03:17.361 --> 03:20.385
I see you met our devout 
leader Ned Flandish.

03:20.580 --> 03:21.958
Stupid Flandish.

03:22.223 --> 03:25.586
Listen, since all the other 
fun stuff is out of bounds,

03:25.642 --> 03:28.495
how about a little bible-thumping in the crow's nest?

03:28.951 --> 03:30.336
What do you say, miss...?

03:30.382 --> 03:32.925
Constance Prudence Chastity Goodfaith.

03:33.263 --> 03:34.657
My friends call me Marge.

03:35.241 --> 03:38.157
Marge Obedience Temperance Sexwon't.

03:38.890 --> 03:39.998
Back off, newbie!

03:40.042 --> 03:40.967
We're engaged.

03:41.013 --> 03:42.938
I didn't kill her husband just so...

03:43.103 --> 03:44.778
I mean, I-I didn't kill her husband.

03:44.813 --> 03:46.458
We're not engaged.

03:46.500 --> 03:49.768
It's really more of an amiable concordance.

03:51.343 --> 03:53.098
Such language from a woman.

03:53.103 --> 03:55.896
Oh, no! I just thought of you as a woman!

03:57.551 --> 04:02.206
Lord, we thank you for the 
many ways you show your love:

04:02.371 --> 04:06.267
The sun which bakes our 
lips to the point of bleeding

04:06.313 --> 04:10.026
and your hilarious idea to surround us with water

04:10.041 --> 04:12.257
that would kill us if we drank it.

04:12.501 --> 04:13.506
Now I got to warn you.

04:13.540 --> 04:17.315
Even for this day and age, 
I'm considered a bad husband.

04:17.440 --> 04:20.958
She's going to marry him 'cause he 
wears boots instead of blackening his

04:21.011 --> 04:21.524
feet.

04:26.102 --> 04:30.055
Well, I'm sure the way to win 
her heart is to be fat and crying.

04:30.151 --> 04:31.555
Why, thee little...!

04:36.340 --> 04:37.876
Don't stop.

04:38.133 --> 04:41.665
You're choking him just the way his father used to.

04:41.702 --> 04:42.987
Good times.

04:45.352 --> 04:48.536
Perhaps thou wouldst make a good father.

04:49.103 --> 04:51.465
May I escort you to the railing?

04:52.500 --> 04:55.367
My god. Look at that hand-on-hand action.

04:55.440 --> 04:58.686
If I don't do something, soon 
they'll be exchanging pleasantries.

04:59.180 --> 05:01.375
Yes, the weather is fair.

05:01.481 --> 05:04.875
Man! That guy sends my humors 
from sanguine to bilious!

05:05.011 --> 05:06.796
That's how we talk. Weird?

05:07.000 --> 05:09.675
Time to think of a plan most sneaky.

05:09.702 --> 05:12.857
Anyways, I just wanted to let 
you know that I'm throwing

05:12.901 --> 05:17.318
a little party tonight to celebrate 
that only half of us have died so far.

05:21.360 --> 05:24.598
Beer? I thought you guys 
didn't drink on the gayflower?

05:24.753 --> 05:26.325
Stop calling it that!

05:26.530 --> 05:27.165
Whatever.

05:27.191 --> 05:29.815
I was saving this booze to mess up the indians,

05:29.843 --> 05:33.348
but seeing what good pals we are, 
I wanted to give you a taste.

05:33.780 --> 05:35.746
Say, I know a good drinking game.

05:35.791 --> 05:38.178
Take a sip every time a wave hits the ship.

05:41.021 --> 05:42.697
You're good at this.

05:46.322 --> 05:51.486
Lord, thank you for this generous 
rain and abundant lightning.

05:54.270 --> 05:58.025
Obviously, kissing your 
ass is getting me nowhere.

06:00.951 --> 06:02.455
This storm's blowing us off course.

06:02.570 --> 06:04.086
And where's our crew?

06:04.193 --> 06:05.805
I'll show you where they are.

06:06.002 --> 06:07.766
You don't want to miss this, Marge.

06:10.540 --> 06:12.845
Sin, sin, sin!

06:12.942 --> 06:15.598
Horseplay? Roughhousing?

06:15.612 --> 06:17.077
Horsehousing?

06:17.311 --> 06:19.918
And here's the knave what's responsible.

06:21.323 --> 06:23.915
That's all I needed to hear.

06:26.371 --> 06:29.277
Homer, I can't believe I was 
thinking of letting you

06:29.310 --> 06:31.285
touch my elbow through a cloth.

06:31.372 --> 06:33.088
But, baby, a man has needs.

06:36.882 --> 06:38.867
Our captain's be-head-bumped.

06:39.410 --> 06:42.016
I guess we'll never make it to the new world.

06:42.060 --> 06:46.055
When we landed I was going to 
denounce my sister as a witch.

06:46.072 --> 06:48.576
I keep telling you the ability to add

06:48.623 --> 06:50.866
two-digit numbers is not witchcraft.

06:51.011 --> 06:52.087
31 + 43?

06:52.152 --> 06:52.896
74.

06:52.971 --> 06:54.926
Witch, witch, witch!

06:55.432 --> 06:56.845
People, this is madness!

06:56.910 --> 06:58.716
We can burn the witch later.

06:58.770 --> 07:00.806
Right now I've got to save this ship.

07:02.302 --> 07:04.925
I've been driving drunk since I was 12.

07:05.021 --> 07:07.046
But first, who's going to help me pee?

07:08.812 --> 07:12.137
They're looking at me 'cause 
I have the key to the stocks.

07:17.182 --> 07:18.416
Don't worry, Marge.

07:18.493 --> 07:21.627
I'll see to it you fundamentalist 
christians live

07:21.632 --> 07:25.396
to take over all America 
by the 21st century.

07:28.942 --> 07:30.127
Look!

07:30.131 --> 07:31.488
An albatross.

07:31.522 --> 07:33.606
It can lead us to safety.

07:36.011 --> 07:37.905
Man, that bird did it all.

07:38.281 --> 07:39.116
Good guy.

07:39.483 --> 07:41.986
I just thought of a name 
for where we're going.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.065
New England.

07:43.213 --> 07:45.747
That's real creative.

07:45.923 --> 07:47.830
What do you call your foot, "new hand"?

07:47.830 --> 07:49.182
At least I'm pitching.

07:51.060 --> 07:52.403
Land ho!

07:52.583 --> 07:53.767
What did you call me?

07:57.810 --> 08:00.838
Great chief Wig-Gum, 
we could never have survived

08:00.932 --> 08:02.806
our first year in the 
new world without you.

08:02.873 --> 08:06.377
I, almost regret what we 
europeans are going to do to you.

08:06.421 --> 08:07.776
What, what are you going to do?

08:08.481 --> 08:11.296
Give you the biggest slice of pumpkin pie.

08:12.270 --> 08:13.996
Also we're going to take 
your land and wipe you out.

08:14.063 --> 08:15.837
Who wants whipped topping?

08:21.833 --> 08:22.897
Here's your bill.

08:22.990 --> 08:24.647
And will there be anything else?

08:24.893 --> 08:26.455
We haven't gotten our food yet.

08:26.670 --> 08:27.727
I'll look into it.

08:29.032 --> 08:29.755
What the...?!

08:32.352 --> 08:33.636
Who else has a story?

08:33.821 --> 08:34.297
I do.

08:34.332 --> 08:36.230
Homer, you can tell the third story.

08:36.230 --> 08:38.975
Bart will tell the second, 
which is usually the weakest.

08:39.863 --> 08:42.678
I'm just trying to take 
the pressure off of you.

08:42.881 --> 08:46.363
Well, one time I read this 
boring comic book

08:46.363 --> 08:48.205
about a ship called the bounty.

08:48.903 --> 08:50.678
Like the paper towels.

08:50.732 --> 08:51.357
Go on.

09:01.801 --> 09:03.956
Captain Bligh, there's a message 
from admiral Nelson.

09:04.011 --> 09:05.197
Thank you, Mr. Christian.

09:08.971 --> 09:11.765
"Bligh... eats... dolphin... boogers."

09:13.951 --> 09:15.713
When you eat as much dolphin as I do

09:15.713 --> 09:17.545
there's bound to be a booger or two in the mix.

09:20.960 --> 09:21.967
Good morning, crew.

09:22.082 --> 09:24.495
Welcome to day 718 of our voyage.

09:24.683 --> 09:25.887
Today's announcements:

09:25.921 --> 09:28.147
First of all, in an effort to save water,

09:28.231 --> 09:30.345
you will no longer be given any water.

09:30.871 --> 09:36.697
And because of a drawing of myself 
having romantic congress with a merman...

09:39.330 --> 09:42.018
I am dumping all your mail from home into the sea.

09:44.553 --> 09:47.333
And I can assure you there were cookies in there.

09:47.333 --> 09:48.207
Good cookies.

09:48.322 --> 09:51.748
The kind only a loving mother 
or Milhouse's father could make.

09:51.890 --> 09:53.520
My father's alive?

09:53.520 --> 09:54.727
No, he died while baking.

09:54.762 --> 09:55.655
It's all in the letter.

09:59.051 --> 10:01.567
I'm getting pretty tired of that seawad.

10:01.622 --> 10:04.037
This is nothing like the recruiting brochure.

10:06.012 --> 10:08.196
Maybe that's what happens on the last day.

10:09.633 --> 10:11.147
I warn you, captain:

10:11.401 --> 10:15.165
Push this crew too far and there'll be mutiny.

10:15.223 --> 10:17.067
Mutiny? On the bounty?

10:18.362 --> 10:19.407
What have you been smoking?

10:19.481 --> 10:20.055
Opium.

10:20.103 --> 10:20.907
Besides that?

10:29.011 --> 10:31.168
Welcome to our tropical paradise.

10:31.223 --> 10:34.517
Enjoy our luaus, our lagoons, and our ladies.

10:34.582 --> 10:38.897
And remember: What happens in 
Tahiti stays in Tahiti.

10:38.912 --> 10:42.738
Because we have no way of 
communicating with the outside world.

10:42.961 --> 10:46.575
Tell me, has Robert Fulton 
invented the steamboat yet?

10:46.633 --> 10:47.847
Any day now.

11:01.011 --> 11:04.626
When you're on a holiday

11:05.132 --> 11:09.098
you can't find the words to say...

11:09.692 --> 11:11.691
I'm telling you, I don't look like that.

11:11.691 --> 11:12.566
Make another.

11:13.462 --> 11:13.723
Yes, lord ugly-face.

11:13.723 --> 11:18.622
...And I want to feel it too 
on an island in the sun...

11:18.622 --> 11:20.836
don't just sit there, help me!

11:21.831 --> 11:22.866
We'll be playing...

11:24.511 --> 11:25.607
Thanks for staying with us.

11:25.711 --> 11:28.207
We appreciate you putting 
cloth over our women's' boobies.

11:28.263 --> 11:30.292
You'll receive an updated bill after you leave.

11:30.292 --> 11:30.827
Bye-bye.

11:32.993 --> 11:35.066
I wish we were back on Tahiti.

11:35.230 --> 11:37.705
Why, yes, it was truly 
an unforgettable vacation.

11:37.981 --> 11:38.958
I order you to forget it.

11:41.582 --> 11:43.876
And while you're working, 
I want to hear a sea chantey...

11:44.083 --> 11:45.326
in a round.

11:45.602 --> 11:50.336
row, row, row your boat 
gently down the stream

11:51.211 --> 11:52.487
Rounder! I hear edges!

11:52.501 --> 11:54.977
Row, row, row your boat 
gently down the stream.

11:55.750 --> 11:56.496
you're off-key.

11:58.430 --> 11:59.557
Make that song your own.

12:00.711 --> 12:03.398
You don't sound like you've ever 
been on a boat in your life.

12:05.862 --> 12:06.318
what the...?

12:06.393 --> 12:08.738
Captain, this is a mutiny.

12:10.951 --> 12:12.835
Let's not be hasty there.

12:12.913 --> 12:15.006
What if I introduce a suggestion box?

12:15.032 --> 12:16.697
We have a suggestion box.

12:16.760 --> 12:19.656
You made it from the head of the 
last guy who had a suggestion.

12:21.953 --> 12:23.308
Yeah, but... I... I...

12:25.142 --> 12:27.508
I warned you there'd be mutiny.

12:27.803 --> 12:29.286
Just start rowing, Willie.

12:29.532 --> 12:30.997
And sing a round while you do.

12:31.703 --> 12:35.080
Row, row, row your boat gently

12:35.080 --> 12:40.110
row, row, merrily, merrily, 
bound the down gently down the...

12:40.110 --> 12:41.627
merrily down the...

12:41.752 --> 12:43.146
I cannot do it!

12:43.182 --> 12:44.548
I'm only one man.

12:44.600 --> 12:46.425
You'll sing or you'll mutiny.

12:46.521 --> 12:49.636
And you're too much of a 
spineless coward for that.

12:52.580 --> 12:54.486
Swim faster or I'll have you made into soup.

12:55.183 --> 12:57.205
What are you going to do, go underwater?

12:57.843 --> 12:59.067
I'd like to see that.

13:01.933 --> 13:03.338
You call this deep?

13:05.760 --> 13:08.945
This is your new captain saying, 
"next stop: Tahiti."

13:11.293 --> 13:12.951
And we're going to remove all evidence of

13:12.951 --> 13:16.597
the previous regime, starting 
with this stupid wheel.

13:25.093 --> 13:28.396
well, I know you had your doubts, 
men, but there they are,

13:28.581 --> 13:31.347
the most beautiful women in the world.

13:33.793 --> 13:35.217
Those are penguins.

13:35.401 --> 13:36.925
Well, look at it this way:

13:37.062 --> 13:38.698
We're going to discover the North Pole.

13:38.821 --> 13:40.027
South Pole.

13:40.152 --> 13:41.415
Oh, boy, do I suck?

13:41.543 --> 13:42.408
Yeah.

13:49.683 --> 13:52.568
I'm starting to think the sea 
captain isn't coming back.

13:52.872 --> 13:54.205
He's out there playing basketball.

13:57.840 --> 13:59.605
In your face, Julio.

14:01.821 --> 14:03.725
I'll be fetching your food right away.

14:04.700 --> 14:05.587
Six more games.

14:05.922 --> 14:09.335
Well, I guess we have time for 
my tale of moist adventure.

14:09.731 --> 14:12.476
It takes place in a dark time for mankind

14:12.641 --> 14:15.107
when madness and ignorance ruled:

14:15.722 --> 14:17.748
The 1970s.

14:18.300 --> 14:20.497
Rock the boat don't rock the boat, baby

14:20.503 --> 14:22.697
rock the boat don't tip the boat over

14:22.700 --> 14:24.996
rock the boat don't rock the boat, baby.

14:25.823 --> 14:28.495
Disco stu has some troubling news.

14:29.871 --> 14:32.657
the ship's doctor has reported an outbreak of...

14:33.121 --> 14:34.537
Disco fever!

14:34.623 --> 14:37.978
The only cure is to do a little 
dance, make a little love...

14:38.130 --> 14:39.475
get down tonight.

14:39.791 --> 14:40.323
Wait a minute.

14:40.323 --> 14:41.217
What was the second one?

14:41.263 --> 14:44.685
And now let's welcome the 
Leroy Neiman of Seamen,

14:44.882 --> 14:48.237
your captain, Montgomery Burns.

14:52.573 --> 14:53.956
Ten-four, good buddy.

14:54.110 --> 14:55.886
I'm Chevy Chase and you're not.

14:56.152 --> 14:57.685
Willy Stargell!

14:57.840 --> 15:00.866
Yes, welcome to the maiden 
voyage of the neptune,

15:00.872 --> 15:03.945
the world's most unflippable luxury liner.

15:04.183 --> 15:08.446
Help yourselves to some pineapple 
upside-down cake and apple turnovers.

15:08.623 --> 15:10.555
And you'll all be getting free hats,

15:10.780 --> 15:13.656
so make sure to give us your cap size!

15:15.860 --> 15:19.408
What a fascinating cross-section of humanity.

15:19.713 --> 15:21.755
You've got the lonely, but lovable loser...

15:22.150 --> 15:23.135
hello, angels.

15:23.243 --> 15:27.235
Your mission today involves going 
undercover at a wet t-shirt contest.

15:28.242 --> 15:29.306
Just get you wet...

15:31.171 --> 15:32.368
maybe not so lovable.

15:32.621 --> 15:33.846
And you've got the elderly

15:33.870 --> 15:36.407
jewish couple making their 
first trip to Israel.

15:36.602 --> 15:40.438
Our son shlomo is working 
on a kibbutz in haifa.

15:40.693 --> 15:42.697
We're schlepping him some kreplach.

15:42.873 --> 15:44.615
We're jewish, all right!

15:45.051 --> 15:45.858
What's our back story?

15:45.881 --> 15:46.806
What's our back story?

15:46.903 --> 15:47.656
We're the band.

15:47.812 --> 15:48.577
And we're on!

15:51.863 --> 16:00.857
I think we're heading for disaster 
and most of you will not be saved

16:00.980 --> 16:11.175
unless the captain is attentive 
we'll all be crushed by a huge wave...

16:11.791 --> 16:13.376
I love the sea, Smithers.

16:13.561 --> 16:18.866
No earthquakes, towering infernos, 
china syndromes, apple dumpling gangs...

16:31.093 --> 16:32.877
My wig! I mean, my natural hair!

16:33.122 --> 16:36.057
Mama mia! What a time to be carrying the soup.

16:37.441 --> 16:39.025
Cool! No gravity!

16:39.402 --> 16:40.435
There it is.

16:45.513 --> 16:47.965
Hey, you schmuck, get off-a me!

16:49.201 --> 16:50.938
Goin' out with a sight gag.

16:51.232 --> 16:52.075
Nice.

16:55.432 --> 16:57.186
I got an idea: Climb into my mouth.

17:01.132 --> 17:04.458
No...!

17:05.522 --> 17:06.747
Catch me, Flanders!

17:09.920 --> 17:12.135
Lord, with you watching over me, 
I shall feel no pain.

17:17.632 --> 17:18.707
It's almost new year's!

17:19.099 --> 17:20.807
Ten... nine... eight...

17:20.982 --> 17:24.448
Homer, the ship's upside down 
and hundreds of people are dead!

17:24.823 --> 17:26.487
...Three... two... one...

17:26.720 --> 17:27.988
Happy new year!

17:31.121 --> 17:32.877
My resolution is to be more fun.

17:33.713 --> 17:36.647
Attention, everyone! I've 
spent the entire cruise

17:36.672 --> 17:40.017
reading these maintenance brochures 
because as a lonely single woman,

17:40.100 --> 17:41.305
I've had nothing better to do.

17:42.892 --> 17:43.628
"Aw"s are cheap.

17:43.943 --> 17:45.158
I'm lookin' for some action.

17:47.672 --> 17:48.347
I thought so.

17:49.063 --> 17:51.727
It says here we should head 
upwards towards the hull

17:52.053 --> 17:53.986
before the ocean starts filling the ship.

17:54.153 --> 17:55.156
Don't listen to her!

17:55.162 --> 17:56.125
She'll get us all killed!

17:56.342 --> 17:59.656
The safest thing to do is to 
resume our normal activities.

17:59.960 --> 18:01.557
Now where is the rumba instructor?

18:02.413 --> 18:04.016
Okay, so that's left, left, right.

18:04.052 --> 18:04.776
Come on, people!

18:12.981 --> 18:16.088
So, now which way do we go in 
this farkaktah-flippity ship?

18:21.210 --> 18:23.007
Homer, what should we do?

18:23.442 --> 18:24.525
Give me a second.

18:24.531 --> 18:25.358
I'm in the bathroom.

18:27.461 --> 18:30.097
What? I have great ass suction.

18:30.432 --> 18:31.656
Now, how about a little privacy?

18:33.493 --> 18:34.106
My keys!

18:36.762 --> 18:39.225
Whatever you do, don't look down. I mean up!

18:40.531 --> 18:41.558
I can't do this anymore.

18:41.570 --> 18:42.555
It's too confusing!

18:45.020 --> 18:46.086
Not that confusing.

18:46.691 --> 18:48.655
This hatchway is jammed!

18:48.821 --> 18:49.906
Move aside!

18:50.140 --> 18:52.775
I'll use my swiss army bone.

19:02.510 --> 19:05.307
Okay, the engine room is just 
through this flooded area.

19:05.330 --> 19:08.147
Somebody has to take the rope, 
swing through to the other side

19:08.170 --> 19:11.056
and tie it off so we can use 
it as an underwater guideline.

19:12.080 --> 19:15.616
Step aside! I shall perform 
the necessary heroics.

19:15.901 --> 19:16.338
Thank you.

19:16.570 --> 19:17.175
You?

19:17.411 --> 19:20.167
Yes. All I need is some 
inspirational music...

19:22.990 --> 19:27.738
when she passed away, 
I cried and cried all day

19:28.083 --> 19:31.406
I'm alone again... naturally

19:32.740 --> 19:34.958
all right, I can see this is all up to me.

19:37.792 --> 19:38.885
Swim, fatty! Swim!

19:41.180 --> 19:42.296
You did it.

19:59.981 --> 20:00.916
I've tied it off.

20:01.130 --> 20:02.295
You're all going to make it.

20:04.133 --> 20:06.125
Tell the world that I saved you all.

20:08.220 --> 20:09.416
Don't tell me what to do.

20:13.012 --> 20:14.016
I hear knocking.

20:14.290 --> 20:15.227
We're saved!

20:22.672 --> 20:24.437
I don't know which pains me more:

20:24.611 --> 20:26.646
The flame or the irony!

20:28.050 --> 20:30.188
Can you believe it's the irony?

20:35.053 --> 20:38.978
My god, our boat is upside-down.

20:45.582 --> 20:47.367
You guys know the way to Tahiti?

20:47.563 --> 20:49.046
Way to go, genius.

20:49.262 --> 20:51.655
You sailed into someone else's tale of the sea.

20:51.870 --> 20:53.906
At last I'm not gay for skeleton Kearney.

20:54.122 --> 20:56.477
Our ribs got tangled 75 years ago

20:56.582 --> 20:57.627
That's not gay.

20:57.803 --> 20:59.277
Right. You keep believing that.
