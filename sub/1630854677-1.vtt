and is suitable for

00:09.200 --> 00:12.266
ogo]

00:20.166 --> 00:21.467
Hark!

00:21.600 --> 00:25.567
The harold angels sing.

00:25.700 --> 00:30.300
Glory to the newborn king.

00:30.433 --> 00:34.967
Peace on Earth and mercy mild.

00:35.100 --> 00:39.734
God and sinners reconciled.

00:39.867 --> 00:43.233
Joy for all ye nations rise--

00:43.367 --> 00:45.467
Our family was
extremely close knit.

00:45.600 --> 00:47.200
We were always together.

00:47.333 --> 00:49.100
And because our last
name was Holiday,

00:49.233 --> 00:51.767
we felt like Christmas
was created just for us.

00:51.900 --> 00:53.100
Hey, mama's song is playing.

00:53.233 --> 00:53.967
It's time!

00:54.100 --> 00:55.934
Time for the stocking!

00:56.066 --> 00:58.600
Robert, stop yelling!

00:58.734 --> 01:01.433
Mama said we can look for the
stocking when her song came on.

01:01.567 --> 01:03.100
I mean, did you all hear me?

01:03.233 --> 01:04.000
It's time!

01:04.133 --> 01:05.800
The neighbors can hear you!

01:05.934 --> 01:07.633
Yup, that's me.

01:07.767 --> 01:10.100
Our father died
in a car accident.

01:10.233 --> 01:12.800
I mean, Mom never
remarried and in many ways,

01:12.934 --> 01:15.433
I felt like the
man of the house.

01:15.567 --> 01:17.367
That looks great, Cricket.

01:17.500 --> 01:20.467
Thanks, Mom.

01:20.600 --> 01:23.200
Oh, this just might
be your calling.

01:23.333 --> 01:24.767
It's perfect.

01:24.900 --> 01:27.367
I want to work with you at
your own bakery one day.

01:27.500 --> 01:30.867
Well, how much
fun would that be?

01:31.000 --> 01:31.700
Cricket, look.

01:31.834 --> 01:32.433
It's snowing.

01:38.934 --> 01:42.133
Guess that means an
angel's getting its wings.

01:42.266 --> 01:43.500
Ma!

01:43.633 --> 01:45.166
Go.

01:45.300 --> 01:46.667
Start searching before your
brother's tonsils fall out.

01:46.800 --> 01:49.033
My grandfathers on both
sides were pastors.

01:49.166 --> 01:50.934
And my parents met at church.

01:51.066 --> 01:52.433
They were big into mission work.

01:52.567 --> 01:54.600
My sisters and I, were not.

01:54.734 --> 01:56.767
So, in the weeks
leading up to Christmas,

01:56.900 --> 01:58.867
my parents made us
play a game that we

01:59.000 --> 02:00.767
call the holiday stocking game.

02:00.900 --> 02:01.600
Hey, I found it.

02:01.734 --> 02:04.033
I get the first guess.

02:04.166 --> 02:06.734
Robert, look.

02:08.200 --> 02:09.934
We'd search for the
holiday stocking,

02:10.066 --> 02:13.900
reach inside, and pull
out the holiday riddle.

02:14.033 --> 02:14.500
Hey Chris.

02:14.633 --> 02:15.000
Stop.

02:15.133 --> 02:16.200
Give it.

02:16.333 --> 02:16.900
Mom?

02:17.033 --> 02:19.200
Let her read it.

02:19.333 --> 02:23.367
Riddle number one: In December,
you can catch this easily,

02:23.500 --> 02:26.233
cannot throw it.

02:26.367 --> 02:28.767
If you guessed the riddle, you
got to choose the good deed.

02:28.900 --> 02:31.667
Five searches, five
riddles, five good deeds

02:31.800 --> 02:33.033
done as a family.

02:33.166 --> 02:34.600
Robert, do you know it?

02:34.734 --> 02:35.367
I do.

02:35.500 --> 02:36.066
A cold.

02:36.200 --> 02:37.533
Very nice.

02:37.667 --> 02:39.233
What would you like to do?

02:39.367 --> 02:41.367
Let's buy some coats
from the thrift store

02:41.500 --> 02:43.500
and hand them out
to the homeless.

02:43.633 --> 02:45.033
It's a great idea, honey.

02:45.166 --> 02:46.066
No fair, Mom.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.767
She just wants to go shopping.

02:47.900 --> 02:50.000
Don't blame me for having the
fastest brain in the family.

02:56.300 --> 02:57.834
You look tired, mommy.

02:57.967 --> 03:00.300
Well, that's because I've
been up baking since 5:00 AM.

03:00.433 --> 03:02.567
I don't like you
working so hard.

03:02.700 --> 03:04.133
No, it's fine.

03:04.266 --> 03:06.333
I will do anything to make
sure that my babies have

03:06.467 --> 03:07.767
the perfect Christmas.

03:07.900 --> 03:08.467
Come here, kids.

03:08.600 --> 03:09.100
Come on.

03:12.433 --> 03:15.767
As much as I want you three
to have the presents you want,

03:15.900 --> 03:18.300
never forget what your
father always said,

03:18.433 --> 03:20.433
the most important
gifts at Christmas

03:20.567 --> 03:23.600
are the things that
money can't buy.

03:40.100 --> 03:42.266
We would still complain
about volunteering,

03:42.400 --> 03:43.567
but once we were doing it.

03:43.700 --> 03:47.667
It was fun and it
made mama so happy

03:47.800 --> 03:50.500
to see us giving
back as a family.

03:50.633 --> 03:55.767
So what exactly is
all of this stuff?

03:55.900 --> 03:56.600
Oh, this box?

03:56.734 --> 03:57.667
Yeah.

03:57.800 --> 03:59.300
Is a key part of
my plan, Sarial.

03:59.433 --> 04:01.000
Your plan?

04:01.133 --> 04:03.400
Robert you transitioned
three weeks ago.

04:03.533 --> 04:05.967
You've completed
your orientation.

04:06.100 --> 04:09.467
I would think you'd be excited
to finally ascend to Heaven.

04:09.600 --> 04:11.467
Yeah, but you say
that so calmly.

04:11.600 --> 04:13.567
This whole thing is
still just strange to me.

04:13.700 --> 04:15.400
I mean, look at this.

04:15.533 --> 04:17.033
Why would they use this picture?

04:17.166 --> 04:18.500
What they doing
with this picture?

04:18.633 --> 04:21.033
I think it looks nice.

04:21.166 --> 04:23.533
Now, back to this plan.

04:23.667 --> 04:28.900
Well, you said it's best to
enter Heaven with no regrets

04:29.033 --> 04:30.900
and I still have
one major one that--

04:38.300 --> 04:40.033
I'd like to make it right.

04:40.166 --> 04:43.967
I mean, my sisters
they've been estranged.

04:44.100 --> 04:46.033
I mean, it got worse
after our mom died.

04:46.166 --> 04:49.133
I mean, they didn't even speak
to each other at my funeral.

04:49.266 --> 04:51.567
And I really regret that I
never made a better effort

04:51.700 --> 04:53.200
to mend our family.

04:53.333 --> 04:57.133
And now your plan has something
to do with this dusty box?

04:57.266 --> 04:58.333
Yes.

04:58.467 --> 04:59.900
Yes.

05:00.100 --> 05:02.633
The Holiday Stocking game.

05:02.767 --> 05:04.367
It always brought us together.

05:04.500 --> 05:07.066
And if I can get
them to play, it just

05:07.200 --> 05:09.066
might stir up some good
old memories, you know.

05:09.200 --> 05:12.200
And maybe they'll remember how
important family really is.

05:12.333 --> 05:18.400
Well, you know what they say,
make plans and watch God laugh.

05:18.533 --> 05:19.600
Does he?

05:19.734 --> 05:21.133
Does he what?

05:21.266 --> 05:23.867
You know, does he laugh?

05:24.000 --> 05:25.433
You'll see.

05:25.567 --> 05:30.400
Well, this decision is
above my prayer grade

05:32.500 --> 05:35.233
What's that?

05:36.934 --> 05:38.066
But you snap your finger--

05:41.266 --> 05:42.433
OK.

05:42.567 --> 05:45.633
You have 12 days.

05:45.767 --> 05:48.467
Why only 12 days?

05:48.600 --> 05:52.033
12 tribes, 12 disciples,
12 Days of Christmas.

05:52.166 --> 05:55.233
My boss has a thing
for the number 12.

05:55.367 --> 05:57.200
But what if I'm not able
to bring them together

05:57.333 --> 05:58.367
in that time?

05:58.500 --> 05:59.934
Well, then your
sister's fate may

06:00.133 --> 06:02.467
be that they remain
estranged, and you'll

06:02.600 --> 06:08.000
have to live with that for
the rest of, well, eternity.

06:08.133 --> 06:09.100
I'm sorry.

06:09.233 --> 06:11.900
No, I can't let that be true.

06:15.300 --> 06:17.266
No, I know I can get
them back together.

06:17.400 --> 06:21.600
Any ideas how you'll get them
to play this stocking game?

06:21.734 --> 06:22.333
Well no, I mean no.

06:22.467 --> 06:23.200
Not yet.

06:23.333 --> 06:24.767
I mean, I got 12 days.

06:24.900 --> 06:26.934
So you're saying your plan
isn't well thought out?

06:27.066 --> 06:28.300
No.

06:28.433 --> 06:31.700
I'm saying, I might
need a little help.

06:31.834 --> 06:34.667
Well, first things first.

06:34.800 --> 06:36.333
Obviously, you're dead.

06:36.467 --> 06:38.767
So you can't just walk up to
your sisters in this body.

06:38.900 --> 06:41.633
So we'll have to
change your appearance.

06:41.767 --> 06:42.633
What?

06:42.767 --> 06:43.934
Hey.

06:44.066 --> 06:45.934
What do you mean
changed my appearance?

06:46.066 --> 06:46.834
Are you ready?

06:46.967 --> 06:47.867
What?

06:48.000 --> 06:49.033
give me a second.

06:55.567 --> 06:56.333
Wow.

06:57.967 --> 06:58.800
Wow.

06:58.934 --> 07:02.166
Wow.

07:02.300 --> 07:03.934
Wow.

07:04.066 --> 07:07.700
Even my voice is different.

07:07.834 --> 07:11.066
My sisters will
never recognize me.

07:11.200 --> 07:13.433
As long as you're
wearing this pendant,

07:13.567 --> 07:15.767
you'll remain visible
to the living.

07:15.900 --> 07:18.266
That way you can at least
communicate with them.

07:21.467 --> 07:22.266
OK.

07:22.400 --> 07:22.934
Right?

07:23.066 --> 07:24.667
Robert meet RJ.

07:24.800 --> 07:26.767
That's your new name.

07:26.900 --> 07:28.934
RJ.

07:29.066 --> 07:31.600
I like it.

07:31.734 --> 07:33.266
Can people see you too?

07:33.400 --> 07:35.367
When I want them to.

07:38.367 --> 07:39.734
Wait.

07:43.700 --> 07:45.066
OK.

07:45.200 --> 07:45.934
OK.

07:46.066 --> 07:46.934
This is going to work.

07:47.066 --> 07:48.734
Don't forget the rules.

07:48.867 --> 07:51.700
You'll appear as a regular human
and can touch and move things.

07:51.834 --> 07:53.767
But your sisters will
not recognize you,

07:53.900 --> 07:56.433
and you cannot tell
them who you are.

07:56.567 --> 07:57.367
Got it.

07:57.500 --> 07:58.567
How will I find you?

07:58.700 --> 07:59.266
Oh.

08:03.233 --> 08:03.934
A flip phone?

08:04.066 --> 08:05.166
Seriously?

08:05.300 --> 08:06.967
It may look old
school, but it's got

08:07.100 --> 08:11.767
everything you need in there,
plus you have angel intuition.

08:11.900 --> 08:13.000
Good luck.

08:13.133 --> 08:14.567
12 days.

08:14.700 --> 08:15.900
Got it.

08:16.033 --> 08:17.066
Thank you.

08:28.266 --> 08:30.433
RJ.

08:44.367 --> 08:50.133
Spelled out snowflakes
falling, the magic in the air.

08:50.266 --> 08:51.500
It was sounds of silver--

08:51.633 --> 08:52.900
How do I look?

08:56.967 --> 09:00.367
Dani Holiday, You look amazing.

09:03.367 --> 09:04.700
You look like a runway model.

09:04.834 --> 09:05.467
Hey.

09:05.600 --> 09:07.166
Thank you, bestie.

09:07.300 --> 09:08.200
You're gorgeous.

09:08.333 --> 09:09.867
Thank you.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.166
Well, I guess when you have
one of the most successful

09:11.300 --> 09:13.200
Black owned advertising
firms in Chicago,

09:13.333 --> 09:14.834
you need to look the part.

09:14.967 --> 09:17.166
Once we secure our
private equity funding,

09:17.300 --> 09:19.734
our firm will not only
be known in Chicago,

09:19.867 --> 09:20.900
we're going national, baby.

09:23.533 --> 09:26.533
You know, I'm excited, but
I don't want to jinx it.

09:26.667 --> 09:27.800
That's why I'm your VP.

09:27.934 --> 09:29.800
I spoke to Ben and
he feels confident

09:29.934 --> 09:31.800
that that deal will
close by Christmas.

09:31.934 --> 09:33.400
Don't worry.

09:33.533 --> 09:36.066
In the meantime, we're going
to every Christmas party,

09:36.200 --> 09:38.066
taking all the
pictures, and making

09:38.200 --> 09:41.967
sure Chicago knows what
Black excellence looks like.

09:42.100 --> 09:43.166
Hey, we might even find a man.

09:43.300 --> 09:43.900
Oh.

09:44.033 --> 09:44.867
Come on down.

09:45.000 --> 09:45.667
Merry Christmas.

09:45.800 --> 09:46.700
Merry Christmas

09:47.834 --> 09:48.800
Oh, that must be the driver.

09:55.333 --> 09:59.166
Hi, you're not the driver.

09:59.300 --> 10:01.233
Dani.

10:01.367 --> 10:02.967
Yes?

10:03.100 --> 10:04.800
How can I help you?

10:04.934 --> 10:05.700
Yes.

10:05.834 --> 10:08.333
Yes, I'm sorry.

10:08.467 --> 10:09.633
I'm RJ.

10:09.767 --> 10:11.367
I'm working with your
brother's estate.

10:11.500 --> 10:12.033
Oh.

10:14.667 --> 10:16.100
How did you know where I live?

10:18.633 --> 10:21.200
Everything was in your
brother's paperwork.

10:21.333 --> 10:22.533
Here.

10:22.667 --> 10:25.834
This is for you.

10:25.967 --> 10:27.667
Can you meet me
tomorrow morning?

10:27.800 --> 10:30.500
The details are inside.

10:30.633 --> 10:32.166
No, wait, wait.

10:32.300 --> 10:34.300
What is this about?

10:34.433 --> 10:36.166
This is his Christmas present.

10:36.300 --> 10:40.233
He wanted to do this in
person, but obviously God

10:40.367 --> 10:42.300
had other plans.

10:42.433 --> 10:44.233
He made me promise that
I'd see it through.

10:47.333 --> 10:48.667
Please, read the card.

11:08.400 --> 11:09.233
Gia!

11:09.367 --> 11:10.633
I'm leaving!

11:10.767 --> 11:12.033
Try to clean up before
your mom gets home!

11:12.166 --> 11:12.567
OK.

11:12.700 --> 11:13.166
Dad!

11:16.200 --> 11:17.700
Hey, you.

11:17.834 --> 11:18.567
Hey.

11:18.700 --> 11:19.800
I was just heading out.

11:19.934 --> 11:20.967
I got a delivery in
Tulsa by morning.

11:21.100 --> 11:22.467
Well, I'm glad I caught you.

11:22.600 --> 11:23.767
Are you going to be
home for Christmas?

11:23.900 --> 11:24.734
Yes.

11:24.867 --> 11:26.467
It's just a seven day run.

11:26.600 --> 11:27.567
So I'll be back next week, and
I'll be here until New Year.

11:27.700 --> 11:28.300
All right.

11:28.433 --> 11:29.133
Well, be safe.

11:29.266 --> 11:29.734
OK.

11:29.867 --> 11:30.433
Love you.

11:30.567 --> 11:31.433
Love you too

11:31.567 --> 11:32.734
OK.

11:32.867 --> 11:35.600
Oh.

11:40.567 --> 11:41.633
Gia, can you come downstairs?

11:48.200 --> 11:49.367
Hey, Mom.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.967
Really?

11:51.100 --> 11:52.400
I thought you were going to
clean up the house today.

11:52.533 --> 11:53.633
What happened?

11:53.767 --> 11:55.734
I'll do it now.

11:55.867 --> 11:58.433
Hey, can I go sledding
with Gabby tomorrow?

11:58.567 --> 12:01.367
I really wanted us to
do that as a family.

12:01.500 --> 12:03.934
I'd rather go with friends.

12:04.066 --> 12:05.166
Here.

12:05.300 --> 12:06.333
This was stuck on
the door earlier.

12:12.000 --> 12:16.433
Dear Marlow, I'm RJ,
Robert's executive assistant.

12:16.567 --> 12:19.667
Though he's transitioned, he
left me special instructions

12:19.800 --> 12:21.867
to deliver his final
Christmas present.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.433
This was very important to him.

12:23.567 --> 12:26.133
Therefore, I hope you will
meet me tomorrow at noon.

12:26.266 --> 12:29.633
The tree at Christmas
Market for more details.

12:29.767 --> 12:31.800
Theresa?

12:31.934 --> 12:34.333
I don't know if I'm
feeling up to going out.

12:36.166 --> 12:39.967
Angels we
have heard on high.

12:40.100 --> 12:43.166
Sweetly singing o'er

12:47.633 --> 12:48.166
Sorry.

12:48.300 --> 12:49.333
I'm late.

12:49.467 --> 12:51.834
I was afraid no
one would show up.

12:51.967 --> 12:52.700
What's that?

12:55.633 --> 12:59.200
I haven't seen this
stocking in years.

12:59.333 --> 13:01.033
Where did you get this?

13:01.166 --> 13:05.600
Well, it was in a box of things
Robert left for you and Marlow.

13:05.734 --> 13:07.367
Well, where's the box?

13:07.500 --> 13:09.567
Well, he wants both
of you to participate

13:09.700 --> 13:13.533
in the Holiday Stocking game,
before I hand over the box.

13:13.667 --> 13:15.834
So you're holding
our things hostage?

13:15.967 --> 13:17.200
No, not at all.

13:17.333 --> 13:20.667
I promise to give you
everything afterwards.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.734
It was important to him
that you and your sister

13:22.867 --> 13:25.233
restart the stocking
family tradition.

13:25.367 --> 13:25.834
My sister?

13:25.967 --> 13:26.700
Yes.

13:26.834 --> 13:28.834
Is Marlow coming?

13:28.967 --> 13:30.567
Probably not.

13:30.700 --> 13:33.433
Perhaps if you talk to
her, she'll come around.

13:33.567 --> 13:35.667
I don't think that's
going to happen.

13:35.800 --> 13:39.000
Friends of Chicago is the
charity you'll be helping.

13:39.133 --> 13:40.567
Robert insisted.

13:40.700 --> 13:43.700
I'd love for you to
still participate.

13:43.834 --> 13:44.667
I'm sorry.

13:44.800 --> 13:47.533
I really don't have time.

13:47.667 --> 13:49.734
Oh, but I do want
to get that box.

13:49.867 --> 13:50.533
Sure.

13:50.667 --> 13:51.934
Thanks

13:52.066 --> 13:52.734
Please reconsider.

14:03.700 --> 14:04.767
Here you are.

14:04.900 --> 14:06.100
Two dozen Christmas
tree cookies.

14:06.233 --> 14:08.133
One winter wonderland
coconut cake.

14:08.266 --> 14:08.734
Thank you.

14:08.867 --> 14:11.567
Enjoy.

14:11.700 --> 14:14.166
I can start that cake order,
if you want to go home early.

14:14.300 --> 14:15.133
No, I got it.

14:15.266 --> 14:16.767
You can handle inventory.

14:19.967 --> 14:21.667
Hi.

14:21.800 --> 14:22.734
Can I help you?

14:22.867 --> 14:30.233
Yes, these all look so, so good.

14:30.367 --> 14:31.100
Thank you.

14:34.033 --> 14:34.567
Wow.

14:38.967 --> 14:42.834
I'll have a reindeer
brownie, please.

14:42.967 --> 14:43.700
All right.

14:46.533 --> 14:47.734
I'm RJ.

14:47.867 --> 14:49.433
I work with your
brother's estate.

14:49.567 --> 14:50.767
Did you get my card?

14:50.900 --> 14:52.333
The mystery card?

14:52.467 --> 14:53.400
Yes.

14:53.533 --> 14:54.433
Yeah.

14:54.567 --> 14:56.433
I've just been busy with orders.

14:56.567 --> 14:57.500
I see that.

15:02.834 --> 15:05.367
Mom.

15:05.500 --> 15:07.066
Excuse me?

15:07.200 --> 15:10.467
Um, is that your mom?

15:10.600 --> 15:13.333
Yeah, this was her shop.

15:13.467 --> 15:16.667
We worked side by
side for many years.

15:16.800 --> 15:18.200
Brownies on the house.

15:18.333 --> 15:21.633
Thank you, but it's important
that you hear me out.

15:21.767 --> 15:23.166
I feel like--

15:23.300 --> 15:24.900
Look, Robert and I, we really
didn't speak that often.

15:25.033 --> 15:28.066
I can't imagine what business
he would have with me.

15:30.667 --> 15:34.333
Robert had that all this time?

15:34.467 --> 15:36.300
Please, it was his last wish.

15:42.333 --> 15:46.200
Like I said, I'm really busy.

15:46.333 --> 15:47.233
OK.

15:47.367 --> 15:49.700
Well, thank you for your time.

15:49.834 --> 15:50.400
Enjoy.

16:13.266 --> 16:14.633
Hey.

16:14.767 --> 16:15.633
Where did you come from?

16:15.767 --> 16:18.300
Don't you worry about that.

16:18.433 --> 16:20.533
Hey.

16:20.667 --> 16:21.367
Stop.

16:21.500 --> 16:22.800
What are you doing?

16:22.934 --> 16:24.133
Seeing if you have another
trick up your sleeve,

16:24.266 --> 16:27.934
because baby sis is
not going for it.

16:28.066 --> 16:28.600
You saw that?

16:35.266 --> 16:36.734
I see everything.

16:36.867 --> 16:37.700
OK.

16:37.834 --> 16:38.767
Well, I have another plan.

16:38.900 --> 16:39.433
So don't worry.

16:39.567 --> 16:41.033
Ooh, brownies.

16:41.166 --> 16:42.967
You know what the best thing
about being an angel is?

16:43.100 --> 16:46.200
You never gain weight.

16:46.333 --> 16:46.834
Oh.

16:51.066 --> 16:53.233
Good morning, Ben.

16:53.367 --> 16:54.700
OK.

16:54.834 --> 16:56.734
Please tell us that you
have good news for us.

16:56.867 --> 16:58.400
Not quite.

16:58.533 --> 17:00.500
My client was
committed to investing,

17:00.633 --> 17:02.166
until she looked at
your profile and saw

17:02.300 --> 17:05.300
that you have no community
initiatives or charity

17:05.433 --> 17:06.533
partnerships.

17:06.667 --> 17:08.467
She never said that
was a requirement

17:08.600 --> 17:10.767
and we've had many meetings.

17:10.900 --> 17:13.800
Technically, it's not, but
if she's investing millions

17:13.934 --> 17:16.333
into your company, you have
to align with her principles

17:16.467 --> 17:18.867
and she's big on philanthropy.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.333
Is she backing out of the deal?

17:21.467 --> 17:22.533
I have to be honest with you.

17:22.667 --> 17:23.667
She's wavering.

17:23.800 --> 17:25.166
OK.

17:25.300 --> 17:26.667
Ben, You know that we're
anticipating this investment

17:26.800 --> 17:28.100
to grow our business.

17:28.233 --> 17:30.533
Look, I want your company
to get this funding.

17:30.667 --> 17:34.533
If you've done any charity
work or community service

17:34.667 --> 17:37.200
get it in front of me and
I'll see what I can do.

17:37.333 --> 17:37.700
OK.

17:37.834 --> 17:39.000
Thanks.

17:39.133 --> 17:39.600
Yeah.

17:39.734 --> 17:40.300
Thanks

17:43.767 --> 17:46.467
Oh.

17:46.600 --> 17:47.600
Oh, Wow.

17:47.734 --> 17:48.600
What are we going to do?

17:48.734 --> 17:50.600
I do not know.

17:50.734 --> 17:52.600
We've worked so hard for this.

17:52.734 --> 17:56.834
I mean, we've won awards, we've
retained fortune 100 clients.

17:56.967 --> 17:59.333
I mean, I personally
network my Jimmy Choos off.

17:59.467 --> 18:00.867
This cannot go down like this.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.200
I agree, but do you have
anything to give to Ben?

18:03.333 --> 18:03.900
No.

18:06.633 --> 18:07.934
Me either.

18:08.066 --> 18:10.100
But I do know where
I could get some.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.166
It's time to wake
up everybody across the world

18:15.300 --> 18:20.033
and sing the longest
time for Christmas.

18:20.166 --> 18:23.266
Can I have your attention?

18:23.400 --> 18:24.667
Yes.

18:24.800 --> 18:27.266
Time to laugh and sing
around the Christmas--

18:27.400 --> 18:29.900
I am so glad you
reached back out.

18:30.033 --> 18:34.233
Well, I had, I had
a change of heart.

18:34.367 --> 18:35.433
What about Marlow?

18:35.567 --> 18:37.233
I'm going to be
doing this on my own.

18:37.367 --> 18:40.033
I hope that's OK.

18:40.166 --> 18:44.100
Well, Robert really
wanted the both of you.

18:44.233 --> 18:45.367
Well, I'm sorry.

18:45.500 --> 18:46.834
I'm all you got.

18:46.967 --> 18:49.333
This isn't exactly how we--

18:49.467 --> 18:52.033
I mean, you, play the game.

18:52.166 --> 18:52.934
It's fine.

18:53.066 --> 18:54.400
Go.

18:54.533 --> 18:56.834
These look just like the
cards that mama made.

18:56.967 --> 18:58.166
Yeah.

18:58.300 --> 18:59.967
Robert took the time
to get it just right.

19:03.567 --> 19:04.667
OK.

19:04.800 --> 19:07.467
Riddle one: I'm loud
but silent, and I

19:07.600 --> 19:09.567
love hanging around
Christmas parties.

19:09.700 --> 19:10.300
What am I?

19:15.867 --> 19:16.400
Tinsel.

19:18.400 --> 19:19.900
Right?

19:20.033 --> 19:21.266
I mean, It's loud and likes
to hang around Christmas.

19:21.400 --> 19:22.000
You got it.

19:22.133 --> 19:22.600
Right.

19:27.066 --> 19:30.133
Have we met before, because
it feels like we've met?

19:30.266 --> 19:31.000
No.

19:31.133 --> 19:31.467
No.

19:31.600 --> 19:32.166
No.

19:32.300 --> 19:33.000
Of course not.

19:33.133 --> 19:34.000
You hungry?

19:34.133 --> 19:37.100
I know I am.

19:37.233 --> 19:40.467
I was wondering why
you had us meet here.

19:40.600 --> 19:41.767
Two reasons.

19:41.900 --> 19:42.800
The food is great.

19:42.934 --> 19:43.967
Really?

19:44.100 --> 19:45.767
And the person
who owns the place

19:45.900 --> 19:47.734
runs the Friends of Chicago.

19:47.867 --> 19:50.100
The foundation you're
volunteering with.

19:50.233 --> 19:52.934
And here he is.

19:53.066 --> 19:53.800
Excuse me.

19:58.400 --> 19:58.967
Hi.

19:59.100 --> 19:59.633
What's up, man?

19:59.767 --> 20:00.333
How you doing?

20:00.467 --> 20:00.934
Good to see you.

20:01.066 --> 20:01.433
You too.

20:01.567 --> 20:03.900
You too.

20:04.033 --> 20:04.467
I got her.

20:04.600 --> 20:05.500
I got you.

20:05.633 --> 20:06.233
Thank you.

20:11.100 --> 20:12.567
Hi.

20:12.700 --> 20:13.433
Hi.

20:13.567 --> 20:15.066
I'm Wilson Whitlock.

20:15.200 --> 20:17.834
Dani Holiday.

20:17.967 --> 20:19.567
I would like to volunteer.

20:19.700 --> 20:20.934
OK.

20:21.066 --> 20:23.900
Well, it's nice to
meet you Ms. Holiday.

20:24.033 --> 20:27.467
I look forward to
working with you.

20:27.600 --> 20:29.467
Welcome to Pat's BBQ.

20:29.600 --> 20:33.834
Can I offer you
something to eat?

20:33.967 --> 20:34.834
I could eat.

20:34.967 --> 20:35.533
Great.

20:43.700 --> 20:48.734
I get so excited when
it snows outside.

20:48.867 --> 20:50.000
Get excited, girl.

20:50.133 --> 20:52.300
You used to love decorating.

20:52.433 --> 20:54.233
I'm never excited at 7:00 AM.

20:54.367 --> 20:56.667
Well, I had to get an
early start, because I

20:56.800 --> 20:58.400
got to get to the shop.

20:58.533 --> 21:00.967
And you can come with me, so
we can go shopping afterwards.

21:01.100 --> 21:02.567
I just thought it
might be nice for us

21:02.700 --> 21:04.500
to spend some time together

21:04.633 --> 21:06.633
I just want to go back to bed.

21:06.767 --> 21:08.533
Girl.

21:08.667 --> 21:10.633
What's this?

21:10.767 --> 21:11.367
Nothing.

21:11.500 --> 21:12.166
You can toss it.

21:12.300 --> 21:15.300
Ornament, please.

21:15.433 --> 21:17.700
I'm trying to figure
out this riddle.

21:17.834 --> 21:19.367
Is this a work thing?

21:19.500 --> 21:22.734
No, when we were kids, we
used to play this holiday game

21:22.867 --> 21:24.467
with riddles to solve.

21:24.600 --> 21:27.467
And your uncle wanted us to
keep that Christmas tradition

21:27.600 --> 21:28.467
this year.

21:28.600 --> 21:29.567
I guess it was in his will.

21:29.700 --> 21:31.166
That sounds fun.

21:31.300 --> 21:32.200
What do you win?

21:32.333 --> 21:33.367
Nothing.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.233
You just solve the
riddle and then

21:35.367 --> 21:37.567
you choose some
volunteer work to do.

21:37.700 --> 21:40.066
Never mind, that
does not sound fun.

21:40.200 --> 21:41.400
What kind of game is that?

21:41.533 --> 21:43.200
Volunteering is good.

21:43.333 --> 21:45.200
My mother, your
grandmother, used

21:45.333 --> 21:48.467
to make us do that every
year around Christmas time.

21:48.600 --> 21:51.000
Ugh, I'm so glad we
don't do that it.

21:51.133 --> 21:54.066
You know, it was actually fun.

21:54.200 --> 21:56.500
Because we would fight
to solve the riddle.

21:56.633 --> 21:58.166
I mean, like fight fight.

21:58.300 --> 22:01.367
And once we did, we just
chose the volunteer work.

22:01.500 --> 22:02.567
And it wasn't so bad.

22:02.700 --> 22:03.600
Sounds like torture.

22:07.200 --> 22:08.400
So.

22:08.533 --> 22:10.200
Mm-hmm.

22:10.333 --> 22:12.133
The boots I was
telling you about,

22:12.266 --> 22:13.867
they're on sale for $300.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.266
We should get them today.

22:15.400 --> 22:19.700
Are you asking me or telling me?

22:19.834 --> 22:21.066
You know what?

22:21.200 --> 22:22.133
I think volunteer work
would be good for you.

22:22.266 --> 22:23.800
No, no, no.

22:23.934 --> 22:24.767
I'm asking you.

22:24.900 --> 22:25.867
I'm totally asking you.

22:26.000 --> 22:26.800
Oh no, honey.

22:26.934 --> 22:28.300
It's too late.

22:28.433 --> 22:29.133
You know what?

22:29.266 --> 22:30.133
I think this is a sign.

22:30.266 --> 22:30.867
Yes.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.367
It is a sign.

22:32.500 --> 22:34.900
We will do this volunteer
work, because you

22:35.033 --> 22:37.800
need to understand that
Christmas is not just

22:37.934 --> 22:38.900
about receiving.

22:39.033 --> 22:39.600
No.

22:39.734 --> 22:40.367
Please don't.

22:40.500 --> 22:41.800
Oh, it's done.

22:41.934 --> 22:42.967
Done, done, done.

22:43.100 --> 22:45.767
Dun, dun, dun, dun.

22:45.900 --> 22:46.867
Hey.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.133
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

22:49.266 --> 22:52.033
Your mama got that swag that
you got at school Dun,

22:52.166 --> 22:53.100
dun dun, dun.

22:53.233 --> 22:53.967
Oh yes, honey.

22:54.100 --> 22:54.800
You're going to love it.

23:00.934 --> 23:01.433
OK.

23:01.567 --> 23:02.700
No, no, no.

23:02.834 --> 23:04.266
Let's bring it in
a little bit more.

23:04.400 --> 23:05.834
Nope, that's not it.

23:05.967 --> 23:08.800
A little over to the left.

23:08.934 --> 23:09.934
OK.

23:10.066 --> 23:10.767
Actually that's
that right there.

23:10.900 --> 23:11.467
Right there.

23:11.600 --> 23:12.033
That's perfect.

23:12.166 --> 23:13.367
Thank you.

23:13.500 --> 23:15.200
Hey.

23:15.333 --> 23:18.433
When I suggested you decorate
some of the seniors' homes,

23:18.567 --> 23:22.033
I didn't expect you to
hire a professional crew.

23:22.166 --> 23:23.667
Well, I wanted it to look great.

23:23.800 --> 23:25.266
I mean, if I'm going
to do something,

23:25.400 --> 23:27.333
I'm going to do it big.

23:27.467 --> 23:27.967
Clearly.

23:29.467 --> 23:31.867
So how did you get
involved with all this?

23:32.000 --> 23:33.166
My dad.

23:33.300 --> 23:35.467
He ran a soup kitchen
on the south side.

23:35.600 --> 23:38.266
Wait, was it on MLK?

23:38.400 --> 23:39.834
Yeah.

23:39.967 --> 23:41.533
When I was younger,
my family and I

23:41.667 --> 23:43.300
used to volunteer
there all the time.

23:43.433 --> 23:46.000
That was our original
building, but it burned down.

23:46.133 --> 23:47.033
Oh.

23:47.166 --> 23:48.867
Pat's is our new headquarters.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.600
The foundation's
office, in the back.

23:51.734 --> 23:56.133
Wow, what a coincidence.

23:56.266 --> 23:58.967
Maybe, but I like
to think everything

23:59.100 --> 24:01.934
happens for a reason.

24:02.066 --> 24:06.867
Well, I think they're ready.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.200
Great.

24:08.333 --> 24:08.900
Ms. Thorton.

24:09.033 --> 24:09.734
You ready?

24:09.867 --> 24:11.700
Light it up baby.

24:17.300 --> 24:19.600
Right there.

24:19.734 --> 24:22.100
This is what makes
it all worthwhile.

24:22.233 --> 24:24.266
Ms. Thorton, she's a widow.

24:24.400 --> 24:26.667
She didn't have much family.

24:26.800 --> 24:29.166
This means the world to her.

24:29.300 --> 24:32.433
It also means the world to me.

24:32.567 --> 24:37.033
You know, we used to volunteer
all the time when I was a kid.

24:37.166 --> 24:41.400
And I'm ashamed to say that
it has been a while since I've

24:41.533 --> 24:45.033
done anything like this.

24:45.166 --> 24:48.934
Well, I hope this isn't
the last time I see you.

24:49.066 --> 24:50.533
We'll see.

24:50.667 --> 24:53.934
All right.

24:54.066 --> 24:55.600
Let me grab some of this.

24:55.734 --> 24:56.333
OK.

24:56.467 --> 24:57.233
Let's grab some.

24:59.633 --> 25:01.100
Oh.

25:01.233 --> 25:01.567
Oh.

25:01.700 --> 25:03.934
Oh.

25:04.066 --> 25:04.934
OK.

25:05.066 --> 25:06.266
I might have done too much.

25:06.400 --> 25:06.934
No, no.

25:07.066 --> 25:07.567
It's fine.

25:07.700 --> 25:08.934
It's fine.

25:09.066 --> 25:09.900
We're going to make
this right Ms. Thorton,

25:10.033 --> 25:10.600
you just stay right there.

25:16.700 --> 25:17.767
You solved the riddle yet?

25:17.900 --> 25:19.266
No.

25:19.400 --> 25:21.900
Is this volunteering thing
going to take all day?

25:22.033 --> 25:23.400
Oh, wow.

25:23.533 --> 25:26.400
You have gotten so big.

25:26.533 --> 25:27.967
Excuse me?

25:28.100 --> 25:32.233
I'm sorry, I saw a picture
of her at Robert's place.

25:32.367 --> 25:34.300
She was little.

25:34.433 --> 25:35.600
You bake too?

25:35.734 --> 25:37.166
I'll help out here
sometimes, but mama

25:37.300 --> 25:40.400
likes to be the only
one who makes the cakes.

25:40.533 --> 25:41.567
OK.

25:41.700 --> 25:43.066
We did not figure
out the riddle.

25:43.200 --> 25:44.767
So we don't have to volunteer?

25:44.900 --> 25:46.834
Well, when I was younger and
we didn't solve the riddle,

25:46.967 --> 25:47.900
we had chores.

25:48.033 --> 25:49.166
So you can go sweep the kitchen.

25:49.300 --> 25:51.133
Mm-hmm.

25:57.066 --> 25:57.567
Auntie Dani!

26:00.300 --> 26:00.834
Hey.

26:04.033 --> 26:06.400
Look how grown you are.

26:06.533 --> 26:08.200
You are beautiful.

26:08.333 --> 26:09.867
And girl, look at those lashes.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.200
Ooh, if I had those, I
wouldn't be wearing these.

26:13.333 --> 26:14.900
I didn't know she was coming.

26:15.033 --> 26:17.567
Robert wanted his sisters
to play the game, again.

26:17.700 --> 26:20.367
Together like old times

26:20.500 --> 26:21.967
Marlow.

26:22.100 --> 26:23.367
Good to see you.

26:23.500 --> 26:25.200
Same.

26:25.333 --> 26:27.500
Glad to see you're
participating.

26:27.633 --> 26:29.000
I'm actually doing this for Gia.

26:29.133 --> 26:31.800
So she can learn the
importance of giving back.

26:31.934 --> 26:36.200
Whatever reason brought
you both here, I'm glad.

26:36.333 --> 26:37.667
So what's next?

26:37.800 --> 26:39.000
I've already solved one riddle.

26:39.133 --> 26:40.800
Are we going to do
five riddles like we

26:40.934 --> 26:42.000
used to when we were kids?

26:42.133 --> 26:43.500
Wait a minute.

26:43.633 --> 26:45.000
What do you mean you
already solved one riddle,

26:45.133 --> 26:47.000
without me being there?

26:47.133 --> 26:47.700
Wow.

26:47.834 --> 26:48.533
Marlow, really?

26:48.667 --> 26:49.567
Yeah, really.

26:49.700 --> 26:51.333
We can make some adjustments.

26:51.467 --> 26:52.734
OK.

26:52.867 --> 26:54.567
You won't have to
search for the stocking

26:54.700 --> 26:57.400
and the volunteer
assignments can

26:57.533 --> 26:59.300
come through the foundation.

26:59.433 --> 27:02.600
We already have a riddle.

27:02.734 --> 27:05.266
I come bearing gifts as
a child's favorite King

27:05.400 --> 27:07.066
especially during Christmas.

27:07.200 --> 27:08.000
Who am I?

27:10.567 --> 27:12.567
Oh, the kings that
brought the gifts, right?

27:12.700 --> 27:14.300
The frankincense and myrrh.

27:14.433 --> 27:16.300
Those would be wise men.

27:16.433 --> 27:18.567
Those would be kings.

27:18.700 --> 27:19.800
The Mouse King.

27:19.934 --> 27:21.767
Oh, like the Nutcracker, right?

27:21.900 --> 27:23.800
No, no, no, no.

27:23.934 --> 27:25.266
Oh.

27:25.400 --> 27:27.300
Instead of doing chores,
we should go shopping.

27:27.433 --> 27:29.600
Maybe it'll come to
us while we're out.

27:29.734 --> 27:32.200
You are so much like me.

27:32.333 --> 27:33.400
No!

27:33.533 --> 27:34.734
You know, I actually
have to pick up

27:34.867 --> 27:36.567
a dress from a boutique
at North Ridge mall.

27:36.700 --> 27:38.567
Oh, I think the boots I
want are at North Ridge.

27:38.700 --> 27:39.233
Let me check.

27:39.367 --> 27:40.800
I said no.

27:40.934 --> 27:42.400
Is anybody listening to me?

27:45.400 --> 27:48.967
Ooh Lord Father, give me the
serenity to change the things

27:49.100 --> 27:50.467
to accept things
I cannot change--

27:50.600 --> 27:51.300
OK.

27:51.433 --> 27:53.734
Show me those boots.

28:05.066 --> 28:06.533
Remember how mama
used to display

28:06.667 --> 28:10.033
her cakes in the window.

28:10.166 --> 28:13.500
She was so proud.

28:13.633 --> 28:15.000
So how's the shop doing?

28:15.133 --> 28:16.700
Good.

28:16.834 --> 28:18.967
You know, I really
miss seeing Gia.

28:19.100 --> 28:22.000
You can call her anytime.

28:22.133 --> 28:24.000
And I hate that we
barely talk now.

28:27.233 --> 28:29.934
I always wish that I knew how
to bake just like you or mama,

28:30.066 --> 28:32.266
but I guess it wasn't my thing.

28:32.400 --> 28:34.300
I guess taking care
of your sick mother

28:34.433 --> 28:37.800
wasn't your thing either.

28:37.934 --> 28:39.600
I paid for the nurse.

28:39.734 --> 28:41.834
I mean, we have been
over this 1,000 times.

28:41.967 --> 28:43.700
Can we not do this, please?

28:43.834 --> 28:44.533
A stoc-king.

28:44.667 --> 28:45.533
What?

28:45.667 --> 28:47.300
That's the favorite king.

28:47.433 --> 28:48.033
A stocking.

28:50.734 --> 28:52.934
I would never have gotten that.

28:53.066 --> 28:54.834
Ooh, Lil Miss Gia think
she's about to get out

28:54.967 --> 28:55.700
of volunteering.

28:55.834 --> 28:56.967
We will say about that.

28:57.100 --> 28:58.000
Hey RJ!

28:58.133 --> 28:59.533
I solved it!

28:59.667 --> 29:01.100
Stocking!

29:01.233 --> 29:02.233
It's a stocking.

29:02.367 --> 29:03.400
No.

29:03.533 --> 29:04.934
Please don't go
sledding without me.

29:05.066 --> 29:06.700
That's great news.

29:06.834 --> 29:08.033
Yes.

29:08.166 --> 29:09.100
What's great news?

29:09.233 --> 29:10.767
I spoke to Mrs. Whitlock.

29:10.900 --> 29:12.500
She says that tonight they're
making meals for the sick

29:12.633 --> 29:13.900
and shut in.

29:14.033 --> 29:15.266
Oh.

29:15.400 --> 29:19.166
Well, I can't cook, but
I can call the caterer.

29:19.300 --> 29:22.433
I've used this company before
and the food is amazing.

29:22.567 --> 29:26.533
The whole point of volunteering
is to actually volunteer.

29:26.667 --> 29:28.600
Well, I can't tonight
because I have plans.

29:28.734 --> 29:30.333
RJ, we can volunteer
tomorrow, right?

29:30.467 --> 29:33.166
I'm trying to teach Gia
the importance of service

29:33.300 --> 29:34.233
and she looks up to you.

29:34.367 --> 29:35.266
OK.

29:35.400 --> 29:36.367
Well, we can do something now.

29:36.500 --> 29:37.700
I'm working now.

29:37.834 --> 29:39.166
What happened to us
spending time together?

29:39.300 --> 29:40.600
We still will.

29:40.734 --> 29:42.700
We still have three cards,
three riddles, right?

29:42.834 --> 29:43.367
You know what?

29:43.500 --> 29:44.367
Fine.

29:44.500 --> 29:45.166
We'll just do it ourselves.

29:45.300 --> 29:45.600
No.

29:45.734 --> 29:46.200
Wow.

29:46.333 --> 29:47.433
Marlow.

29:47.567 --> 29:50.066
Hey, do you, like
you usually do, fam.

29:50.200 --> 29:50.734
Oh, word?

29:50.867 --> 29:51.400
OK.

29:51.533 --> 29:52.000
You know what?

29:52.133 --> 29:52.567
Fine.

29:52.700 --> 29:53.066
Forget it.

29:53.200 --> 29:53.767
No

29:53.900 --> 29:54.266
No, no, I tried.

29:54.400 --> 29:54.867
No wait.

29:55.000 --> 29:55.367
Marlow!

29:55.500 --> 29:55.934
Wait.

29:56.066 --> 29:56.433
Danny.

29:56.567 --> 29:58.100
Danny!

29:58.233 --> 29:59.266
Marlow!

29:59.400 --> 29:59.967
Oh.

30:06.967 --> 30:09.834
me.

30:09.967 --> 30:11.800
T, why do you wait
until the last minute

30:11.934 --> 30:13.567
to find your holiday drip?

30:13.700 --> 30:15.734
Because you have a
stylist on speed dial.

30:19.834 --> 30:20.333
Bam.

30:20.467 --> 30:21.667
Yes, girl.

30:21.800 --> 30:25.000
The category is gorgeous.

30:25.133 --> 30:26.367
Give it.

30:26.500 --> 30:27.033
Live it.

30:29.333 --> 30:31.166
I have two bloggers who
want to interview you

30:31.300 --> 30:34.567
about your Christmas traditions,
and all of your volunteer work.

30:34.700 --> 30:35.633
OK.

30:35.767 --> 30:37.333
Any other investor prospects?

30:37.467 --> 30:39.700
Not as interested.

30:39.834 --> 30:41.133
I'm working on news coverage.

30:41.266 --> 30:41.700
OK.

30:41.834 --> 30:42.734
Good.

30:42.867 --> 30:44.834
In the meantime, sweet talk Ben.

30:44.967 --> 30:46.500
I think he likes you.

30:46.633 --> 30:49.133
I think Ben likes the
sound of his own voice.

30:49.266 --> 30:51.700
I'm just looking for someone
who cares about more than just

30:51.834 --> 30:52.567
himself.

30:52.700 --> 30:54.667
Girl, aren't we all.

30:54.800 --> 30:55.834
I don't know.

30:55.967 --> 30:58.567
I think I might
have found someone

30:58.700 --> 31:00.300
Who?

31:00.433 --> 31:03.800
The guy runs a foundation
that I'm volunteering with.

31:03.934 --> 31:04.567
T, please.

31:04.700 --> 31:05.233
OK.

31:05.367 --> 31:06.266
He's tall.

31:06.400 --> 31:07.900
He's fine.

31:08.033 --> 31:10.934
And he just has this
really sweet spirit.

31:13.400 --> 31:15.266
I think I might ask him out.

31:15.400 --> 31:18.033
Send me his full name and
let me do some research.

31:18.166 --> 31:21.033
Girl, his family owns a barbecue
place and he runs a foundation.

31:21.166 --> 31:23.133
What is there to research?

31:23.266 --> 31:25.266
Credit score, kids, ex-wives.

31:25.400 --> 31:27.900
Just send me his name.

31:28.033 --> 31:28.800
Yeah.

31:28.934 --> 31:29.867
Yeah.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.867
I'm going to send you his name.

31:37.200 --> 31:37.734
Merry Christmas.

31:42.734 --> 31:43.734
Merry Christmas.

31:43.867 --> 31:44.767
Thank you.

31:44.900 --> 31:46.300
Welcome to the holiday bake--

31:46.433 --> 31:50.066
Before you say
anything, I'm sorry.

31:50.200 --> 31:51.734
Can I take you out to lunch?

31:51.867 --> 31:56.300
Your office may be closed
for the holiday, mine is not.

31:56.433 --> 31:57.767
Can we just start over?

31:57.900 --> 32:01.800
Dani, I don't have
time for this.

32:01.934 --> 32:05.200
Can you just please leave
so I can get back to work?

32:05.333 --> 32:06.600
OK.

32:06.734 --> 32:13.100
But dad, mom, Robert,
they're all gone.

32:13.233 --> 32:16.934
And I only have one sister.

32:17.066 --> 32:17.633
You're my family.

32:21.667 --> 32:22.433
I'm trying, Marlow.

32:27.433 --> 32:32.467
It
goes jingle bells, jingle bells,

32:32.600 --> 32:37.433
jingling all no the way.

32:37.567 --> 32:40.300
Remember when dad used to bring
us here to get mom's Christmas

32:40.433 --> 32:41.834
presents?

32:41.967 --> 32:46.600
No, I was four when
he died, remember?

32:46.734 --> 32:48.333
Yeah.

32:48.467 --> 32:50.500
You know, we used
to get hot chocolate

32:50.633 --> 32:54.667
and he loved extra marshmallows
with just a pinch of cinnamon.

32:58.266 --> 33:00.600
You keep saying that
you're here because of Gia,

33:00.734 --> 33:03.734
but you've got to have a bit
of holiday spirit in there

33:03.867 --> 33:05.400
somewhere.

33:05.533 --> 33:08.033
Well, I'm not miserable, if
that's what you're asking.

33:08.166 --> 33:09.700
Well, I'll accept that as a yes.

33:12.567 --> 33:13.400
Wow.

33:13.533 --> 33:15.200
She has grown up so much.

33:15.333 --> 33:16.867
Mm-hmm.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.333
There was a time when Gia
would cry when I left the room.

33:19.467 --> 33:22.000
Now, she cries when
she has to be with me.

33:22.133 --> 33:23.867
It's the same way
we were with mom.

33:24.000 --> 33:24.834
You were.

33:24.967 --> 33:26.333
I was not.

33:26.467 --> 33:28.867
I started working at the
bakery when I was Gia's age.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.567
Mom and I were inseparable.

33:31.700 --> 33:33.100
That's true.

33:33.233 --> 33:35.867
I mean, you were
the closest to her.

33:36.000 --> 33:39.066
And you had plenty
of opportunities.

33:39.200 --> 33:39.767
OK.

33:39.900 --> 33:40.533
Look Marlow--

33:40.667 --> 33:42.200
Mom, Is that RJ?

33:46.800 --> 33:48.200
How did you find us?

33:48.333 --> 33:51.700
Um, I guess I have a sixth
sense for these things.

33:51.834 --> 33:52.667
May I?

33:52.800 --> 33:53.367
Of course.

34:00.300 --> 34:02.433
Santa Claus was tired
and had trouble walking,

34:02.567 --> 34:04.734
so he went to a doctor
and asked for help.

34:04.867 --> 34:06.433
What did the doctor give him?

34:10.233 --> 34:11.333
OK.

34:11.467 --> 34:13.066
I don't remember
these being this hard.

34:13.200 --> 34:15.400
If we don't know the answer,
can we just get another riddle?

34:15.533 --> 34:18.934
No, because then we have
to solve both, mom's rules.

34:19.066 --> 34:20.633
Well we're not 10.

34:20.767 --> 34:23.166
You know, I'll give you
some time to think about it,

34:23.300 --> 34:26.900
while I see if I can find
myself some hot cocoa

34:27.033 --> 34:30.300
with extra marshmallows
and a pinch of cinnamon.

34:33.533 --> 34:36.333
Call me if you figure it out.

34:36.467 --> 34:37.834
OK.

34:37.967 --> 34:40.600
I'm still trying to figure
out how he found us.

34:40.734 --> 34:42.834
It's like he's stalking us.

34:42.967 --> 34:45.934
And it's weird that he's always
wearing the same clothes.

34:46.066 --> 34:47.133
He has a flip phone.

34:47.266 --> 34:49.033
If that's not
suspicious what is?

34:51.600 --> 34:54.233
OK I'm going to help at the
foundation's neighborhood

34:54.367 --> 34:55.400
party.

34:55.533 --> 34:56.667
You guys want to come?

34:56.800 --> 34:57.600
Sure.

34:57.734 --> 34:58.900
We'll be there.

34:59.033 --> 35:00.533
Which means I got to
get back to the shop

35:00.667 --> 35:02.133
and complete an order up.

35:02.266 --> 35:03.367
Wow.

35:03.500 --> 35:04.533
What's up, homie?

35:04.667 --> 35:05.900
That's a whole wave.

35:06.033 --> 35:06.834
Yeah, a whole wave.

35:06.967 --> 35:08.066
Wow.

35:08.967 --> 35:10.000
Come.

35:10.133 --> 35:12.233
O come.

35:12.367 --> 35:14.633
O come.

35:14.767 --> 35:18.467
O come ye faithful, come.

35:18.600 --> 35:20.800
O come.

35:20.934 --> 35:23.500
O come.

35:23.633 --> 35:26.000
O come ye faithful.

35:26.133 --> 35:30.667
Come all ye faithful.

35:30.800 --> 35:34.567
Joyful and triumphant.

35:34.700 --> 35:36.567
O come ye.

35:36.700 --> 35:38.000
O come--

35:38.133 --> 35:40.500
Any luck finding
anything out on RJ?

35:40.633 --> 35:42.667
Oh well Robert's offices
are closed for the holidays,

35:42.800 --> 35:46.667
so no luck on finding out
about our mystery man.

35:46.800 --> 35:48.233
Hi.

35:48.367 --> 35:49.033
Hey.

35:49.166 --> 35:50.467
I'm Jamal.

35:50.600 --> 35:51.233
I'm Gia.

35:54.500 --> 35:55.533
No, he Didn't.

35:55.667 --> 35:57.667
So you live around here?

35:57.800 --> 35:59.166
No.

35:59.300 --> 36:01.033
My mom's into volunteering
so she made me come.

36:01.166 --> 36:02.900
Did your mom make you come too?

36:03.033 --> 36:03.734
No.

36:03.867 --> 36:05.600
This is kind of fun.

36:05.734 --> 36:06.300
Here.

36:06.433 --> 36:08.133
Thanks.

36:08.266 --> 36:09.767
Candy cane.

36:09.900 --> 36:13.100
He couldn't walk, so
he got a candy cane.

36:13.233 --> 36:15.767
That's the first
one I figured out.

36:15.900 --> 36:17.967
It's a riddle contest.

36:18.100 --> 36:20.967
Oh cool, I like riddles.

36:25.967 --> 36:28.400
pbe]

36:35.700 --> 36:37.867
Someone looks like they're
having a good time tonight.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.533
I have an emergency at the shop.

36:39.667 --> 36:40.700
It's the last thing I needed.

36:40.834 --> 36:41.367
I'm going to have to go.

36:41.500 --> 36:42.200
I'm sorry.

36:42.333 --> 36:43.834
Gia, grab your coat.

36:43.967 --> 36:44.734
We're leaving now?

36:44.867 --> 36:46.100
Yes.

36:46.233 --> 36:48.333
Well, I can always drop
her home, if you want.

36:48.467 --> 36:50.333
I mean, unless you need
us to come with you now.

36:50.467 --> 36:51.100
No.

36:51.233 --> 36:51.934
I can handle it.

36:52.066 --> 36:52.900
I'll be fine.

36:53.033 --> 36:53.934
Just take care of my baby.

36:54.066 --> 36:54.867
OK.

36:55.000 --> 36:55.600
I'll check on you later.

36:55.734 --> 36:56.700
All right.

36:56.834 --> 36:57.400
Be careful.

37:05.633 --> 37:09.066
She's in the house safely and
she actually admitted to me

37:09.200 --> 37:10.500
that she had fun.

37:10.633 --> 37:12.233
Thank you.

37:12.367 --> 37:14.133
I'm actually living inside The
Nightmare Before Christmas.

37:14.266 --> 37:17.400
I have another order of
100 cupcakes for tomorrow

37:17.533 --> 37:18.967
with a broken oven.

37:19.100 --> 37:20.767
Oh Wow.

37:20.900 --> 37:23.567
Well, I'll ask if you could
use the oven at Pat's.

37:23.700 --> 37:25.333
Oh, that's a good idea.

37:25.467 --> 37:27.333
Yeah, Wilson and his
mom are still there.

37:27.467 --> 37:29.166
I can always stop back by.

37:29.300 --> 37:30.333
Mm-hmm.

37:30.467 --> 37:32.000
Now, are you doing
this for me or

37:32.133 --> 37:33.800
are you doing this for yourself?

37:33.934 --> 37:35.266
What do you mean?

37:35.400 --> 37:37.900
I saw you and Wilson just
looking at each other,

37:38.033 --> 37:40.166
gazing into each other's eyes.

37:40.300 --> 37:42.600
I think he's really into you.

37:42.734 --> 37:44.767
Girl, I can see you
smiling through the phone.

37:44.900 --> 37:45.633
OK.

37:45.767 --> 37:47.233
You know, whatever.

37:47.367 --> 37:48.600
I will see if you can use
that oven in the morning.

37:48.734 --> 37:50.166
And you're welcome, by the way.

37:50.300 --> 37:51.100
Goodnight.

38:01.700 --> 38:04.033
Baking?

38:04.166 --> 38:06.400
Aren't you full of surprises?

38:06.533 --> 38:08.200
Oh this is nothing.

38:08.333 --> 38:09.567
I actually went
to culinary school

38:09.700 --> 38:12.033
and worked as a chef for a year.

38:12.166 --> 38:13.033
Impressive.

38:13.166 --> 38:14.333
Thank you.

38:14.467 --> 38:17.400
But my heart is really
in philanthropy.

38:17.533 --> 38:19.667
Goodnight you two.

38:19.800 --> 38:20.633
Goodnight, Ma.

38:20.767 --> 38:22.000
Goodnight, Mrs. Whitlock.

38:22.133 --> 38:23.233
And Thank you so much
for letting my sister

38:23.367 --> 38:24.233
use the oven tomorrow.

38:24.367 --> 38:25.667
No problem.

38:25.800 --> 38:27.533
I hope we'll see you
around here more often.

38:27.667 --> 38:28.400
Bye, Ma.

38:33.934 --> 38:35.233
So what kind of
cookies are these?

38:35.367 --> 38:38.000
Sugar cookies.

38:38.133 --> 38:39.033
Want to know my secret?

38:39.166 --> 38:39.633
Sugar?

38:42.000 --> 38:42.867
Honey.

38:43.000 --> 38:43.667
Oh OK.

38:43.800 --> 38:44.467
Yeah.

38:44.600 --> 38:45.867
You want to help?

38:46.000 --> 38:48.567
You know, baking is not
really my thing so--

38:48.700 --> 38:49.867
Is frosting your thing?

38:50.000 --> 38:51.133
Oh, now that I can do.

38:51.266 --> 38:51.734
All right.

38:51.867 --> 38:52.400
OK.

38:52.533 --> 38:53.066
Watch me work.

38:53.200 --> 38:54.333
All right.

38:54.467 --> 38:57.734
So what do you do
other than not bake?

38:57.867 --> 39:00.467
Well, not to toot
my own horn, but I

39:00.600 --> 39:02.767
do own the largest
African-American advertising

39:02.900 --> 39:04.200
firm in Chicago.

39:04.333 --> 39:05.533
Wait a minute.

39:05.667 --> 39:07.100
I've heard of you.

39:07.233 --> 39:08.700
You own DHH.

39:08.834 --> 39:11.066
I do.

39:11.200 --> 39:13.533
We reached out to you guys
about doing some pro bono work

39:13.667 --> 39:15.600
for our clothing drive.

39:15.734 --> 39:17.600
I don't remember that campaign.

39:17.734 --> 39:19.934
Because your company
doesn't do pro bono work.

39:20.066 --> 39:22.400
And we couldn't afford you.

39:22.533 --> 39:23.367
Sorry.

39:23.500 --> 39:25.100
It's all good.

39:25.233 --> 39:27.800
Well, you know the owner now,
so feel free to call whenever.

39:27.934 --> 39:29.800
Well, now we have a
long standing contract

39:29.934 --> 39:31.033
with Matlock Advertising.

39:31.166 --> 39:32.533
So--

39:32.667 --> 39:33.367
Oh.

39:34.867 --> 39:37.233
Excuse me.

39:38.700 --> 39:39.967
My mom forgot her purse.

39:40.100 --> 39:40.767
I'll be right back.

39:40.900 --> 39:41.467
OK.

39:45.166 --> 39:47.300
Oh, Teresa, girl,
perfect timing.

39:47.433 --> 39:48.867
Listen, I was thinking
we should start

39:49.000 --> 39:50.700
doing some more pro bono work.

39:50.834 --> 39:52.033
Oh, that's a good idea.

39:52.166 --> 39:53.767
We'll partner with a
charity and announce it

39:53.900 --> 39:55.200
at the top of the year.

39:55.333 --> 39:57.734
Oh, I did research on Wilson.

39:57.867 --> 39:58.400
What?

39:58.533 --> 39:59.900
Why girl?

40:00.033 --> 40:01.200
I told you you weren't going
to find anything wrong.

40:01.333 --> 40:02.700
You didn't find
anything wrong did you?

40:02.834 --> 40:05.367
No, no, no, he's
an absolute saint.

40:05.500 --> 40:08.033
You want to get into the
pearly gates, he's your guy.

40:08.166 --> 40:09.600
But if you want to
boost your brand,

40:09.734 --> 40:11.734
you need to meet
Senator Barrington.

40:11.867 --> 40:13.533
He'll be at my New Year's party.

40:13.667 --> 40:14.266
I hear you.

40:14.400 --> 40:15.734
Do you girl?

40:15.867 --> 40:17.300
This holiday giveback
will serve its purpose,

40:17.433 --> 40:19.367
but are you really trying
to scuff up your red bottoms

40:19.500 --> 40:23.100
running around BBQ
joints and food banks?

40:23.233 --> 40:25.734
You are a mogul, my friend.

40:25.867 --> 40:28.533
I'll call you back later.

40:28.667 --> 40:29.567
That was my crazy friend.

40:29.700 --> 40:31.133
She is always joking.

40:32.200 --> 40:32.767
Yeah.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.266
It's getting late.

40:37.400 --> 40:39.133
I think you should
probably head on home.

40:43.200 --> 40:45.400
Yeah.

40:45.533 --> 40:46.400
Good night.

40:46.533 --> 40:47.133
Good night.

41:15.066 --> 41:16.333
Hey hey.

41:16.467 --> 41:17.000
Where's your mom?

41:21.300 --> 41:24.266
Oh, she looks exhausted.

41:24.400 --> 41:29.533
You know she was at Pat's making
cupcakes this morning at 7:00.

41:29.667 --> 41:31.266
The store is her life.

41:31.400 --> 41:34.500
My mom wanted nothing more
than to have her own bake shop

41:34.633 --> 41:37.834
and Marlow helped
to build that dream.

41:37.967 --> 41:40.300
It is her whole world.

41:40.433 --> 41:42.166
She's such a perfectionist.

41:42.300 --> 41:43.967
It's a little hard to work for.

41:44.100 --> 41:45.834
Yeah, she's a lot
like our mother.

41:45.967 --> 41:48.467
Nah, grandma Sarah
was super nice.

41:48.600 --> 41:52.700
Grandmothers are always
nice to their grandchildren.

41:52.834 --> 41:54.433
Candy cane.

41:54.567 --> 41:56.333
I still can't believe
I got the answer right.

41:56.467 --> 41:57.600
Well, you did.

41:57.734 --> 41:59.133
So when did the
stocking thing start?

41:59.266 --> 42:00.734
I've never heard
of it before now.

42:00.867 --> 42:01.834
What?

42:01.967 --> 42:02.600
OK.

42:02.734 --> 42:04.567
So in the 70s--

42:04.700 --> 42:05.533
You know this part--

42:05.667 --> 42:07.266
Mom and dad met at church.

42:07.400 --> 42:10.567
And every Christmas they would
make stockings and give them

42:10.700 --> 42:12.333
to needy families.

42:12.467 --> 42:15.934
So this one Christmas my dad,
who had a huge crush on my mom,

42:16.066 --> 42:17.600
decided to make a
holiday stocking.

42:17.734 --> 42:20.233
And he planned to put a
ring in it and propose.

42:20.367 --> 42:21.066
Propose?

42:21.200 --> 42:22.100
How old were they?

42:22.233 --> 42:23.400
They were only 17.

42:23.533 --> 42:26.000
And she wasn't as
serious about him.

42:26.133 --> 42:29.033
So when my grandfather found out
what my father was going to do,

42:29.166 --> 42:31.400
he said, "The only thing that
better be in that stocking

42:31.533 --> 42:32.767
is a riddle,
because you a joke."

42:35.066 --> 42:36.667
And as punishment,
he made them do

42:36.800 --> 42:40.667
mission work for the rest
of the holiday season.

42:40.800 --> 42:44.533
Well, they fell madly in
love working side by side,

42:44.667 --> 42:48.400
helping out others and they did
that for the next three years.

42:48.533 --> 42:50.166
And you know, my dad,
just to be slick,

42:50.300 --> 42:53.100
did give my grandfather that
stocking, with a riddle in it,

42:53.233 --> 42:56.400
just as he suggested.

42:56.533 --> 42:59.100
And when they got
married, they decided

42:59.233 --> 43:02.467
to make it their
family tradition.

43:02.600 --> 43:04.667
There are five riddles,
because there's five of us.

43:04.800 --> 43:07.333
So we each had a chance to win.

43:07.467 --> 43:08.867
Why don't we still do it?

43:12.033 --> 43:14.734
I guess we all got busy.

43:14.867 --> 43:21.100
But thanks to Robert
and RJ, here we are now.

43:21.233 --> 43:22.800
Did you ever get the tea on RJ?

43:22.934 --> 43:24.467
Nothing yet.

43:24.600 --> 43:26.233
What's his last name?

43:26.367 --> 43:29.300
You know, I don't know.

43:31.300 --> 43:33.100
Speak of the devil.

43:33.233 --> 43:35.100
Oh Hello, ladies.

43:35.233 --> 43:36.667
RJ, do you have Insta?

43:36.800 --> 43:37.633
What's your last name?

43:41.900 --> 43:42.500
I'll be right back.

43:42.633 --> 43:43.233
OK.

43:43.367 --> 43:44.233
Give me one sec.

43:44.367 --> 43:45.000
So weird.

43:45.133 --> 43:45.667
Very.

43:49.667 --> 43:51.567
c]

43:52.400 --> 43:54.767
Sarial.

43:54.900 --> 43:55.467
Sarial.

43:58.700 --> 43:59.367
Sarial.

43:59.500 --> 44:00.800
Where are you?

44:02.333 --> 44:05.133
RJ, you can't just call
me anytime you want.

44:05.266 --> 44:07.433
My eternal life keeps me busy.

44:07.567 --> 44:11.633
I'm in the middle of bowling
a perfect game, again.

44:11.767 --> 44:13.533
I need a last name.

44:13.667 --> 44:14.767
They're going to look me up.

44:14.900 --> 44:16.367
Didn't you think
that would happen?

44:16.500 --> 44:17.700
No.

44:17.834 --> 44:19.266
Can you help me, please?

44:19.400 --> 44:22.667
First, operators then phone
books, now social media.

44:22.800 --> 44:26.100
We never had to deal with
any of this back in the day.

44:29.133 --> 44:30.166
What's happening?

44:30.300 --> 44:31.834
You now have all
social platforms.

44:31.967 --> 44:33.266
When they look you
up, it will look

44:33.400 --> 44:34.633
as if you worked with Robert.

44:34.767 --> 44:36.100
OK.

44:36.233 --> 44:36.667
All right.

44:36.800 --> 44:39.166
Good.

44:39.300 --> 44:41.667
How do I do some of that magic?

44:41.800 --> 44:43.967
You'll learn later.

44:44.100 --> 44:45.967
Thank you.

44:46.100 --> 44:48.333
Oh, my last name?

44:48.467 --> 44:50.433
What is it?

44:50.567 --> 44:51.600
Angel.

44:51.734 --> 44:52.800
Angel?

44:52.934 --> 44:54.166
RJ Angel?

44:54.300 --> 44:55.700
Really?

44:55.834 --> 44:57.867
Maybe you'll think twice
before interrupting me again.

44:59.767 --> 45:00.600
RJ.

45:00.734 --> 45:02.000
OK.

45:06.467 --> 45:09.600
Mom, wake up.

45:09.734 --> 45:11.934
I don't like you
working so much.

45:12.066 --> 45:14.333
Will you please go
home and go to bed?

45:14.467 --> 45:16.667
If you don't take care of
yourself, you'll burn out.

45:16.800 --> 45:18.166
I am fine.

45:18.300 --> 45:22.600
I'm just happy that the
oven is working again.

45:22.734 --> 45:24.066
Here comes our mystery man.

45:26.633 --> 45:28.367
Hi.

45:28.500 --> 45:31.767
RJ, since we helped out at
family night last night.

45:31.900 --> 45:33.400
Does the count
toward riddle three.

45:33.533 --> 45:34.400
That's not how it works

45:34.533 --> 45:35.433
OK.

45:35.567 --> 45:37.166
Well, here comes riddle four.

45:37.300 --> 45:44.100
Let's see, when does Christmas
come before Thanksgiving?

45:44.233 --> 45:45.834
The dictionary.

45:45.967 --> 45:46.333
OK.

45:46.467 --> 45:47.767
Good.

45:47.900 --> 45:49.500
Oh, we should take the
clothes from our closets

45:49.633 --> 45:52.100
and give it to the women at the
Love and Grace women's shelter.

45:52.233 --> 45:54.834
Last night, Mrs. Whitlock told
me it was one of her charities.

45:54.967 --> 45:57.400
Well, that's not
quite volunteering.

45:57.533 --> 45:59.166
That's because you
haven't seen my closet.

45:59.300 --> 46:01.600
But it does benefit
the foundation.

46:01.734 --> 46:03.166
I think it's a great idea.

46:03.300 --> 46:04.900
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

46:05.033 --> 46:06.467
Let's do it.

46:06.600 --> 46:08.433
You know, I don't think
it's that great of an idea.

46:08.567 --> 46:09.767
Why not?

46:09.900 --> 46:12.500
Because number one,
my wardrobe's couture.

46:12.633 --> 46:17.166
And two, the Whitlock's may not
be that fond of me right now.

46:17.300 --> 46:19.333
Did Wilson mention
me this morning?

46:19.467 --> 46:20.300
No.

46:20.433 --> 46:23.166
What did you do?

46:23.300 --> 46:24.633
It's a long story.

46:24.767 --> 46:26.467
Oh, I need to clean up my
closet for all the gifts

46:26.600 --> 46:27.767
dad's giving me.

46:27.900 --> 46:29.100
I'm pretty excited.

46:29.233 --> 46:31.100
I'm sure the shelter
will be happy to receive

46:31.233 --> 46:33.233
whatever you have to give.

46:33.367 --> 46:35.667
Now, I must go.

46:35.800 --> 46:37.333
Oh, your last name.

46:37.467 --> 46:38.333
What is it?

46:41.100 --> 46:42.400
Angel.

46:42.533 --> 46:43.433
Excuse me?

46:46.266 --> 46:48.467
RJ Angel.

46:48.600 --> 46:50.500
Well, what does
the RJ stand for?

46:50.633 --> 46:51.567
It stands for nothing.

46:51.700 --> 46:54.467
Just an R and a J. That's all.

46:57.967 --> 46:58.567
You OK?

46:58.700 --> 47:00.233
Yeah.

47:00.367 --> 47:01.967
It's just your eyes.

47:02.100 --> 47:04.567
I'm sure we've met before.

47:04.700 --> 47:07.533
Maybe, no, I don't think so.

47:07.667 --> 47:10.867
I don't think so at all.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.200
Have a good one.

47:13.333 --> 47:15.567
You know, I can
come by your house

47:15.700 --> 47:17.700
and help you with your
closet tonight, if you like.

47:17.834 --> 47:21.667
Oh well, only if
you feel like it.

47:21.800 --> 47:23.400
I mean, I do want
you to get some rest.

47:23.533 --> 47:24.000
Oh no.

47:24.133 --> 47:25.467
I'm good.

47:25.600 --> 47:26.567
Because see, if I don't
come help you tonight,

47:26.700 --> 47:27.867
it's never going to happen.

47:28.000 --> 47:29.000
That part.

47:29.133 --> 47:32.200
Oh, I found him.

47:32.333 --> 47:33.800
Oh, Yeah.

47:33.934 --> 47:36.900
It looks like he did work
with Robert for a few years.

47:37.033 --> 47:38.834
There's a bunch of
pictures of them together.

47:38.967 --> 47:41.533
Oh, I put in a call to
Robert's assistant, Yolanda,

47:41.667 --> 47:44.700
so we'll see what
she has to say.

47:44.834 --> 47:48.400
So I guess until this evening.

47:48.533 --> 47:50.166
Oh girl, stop frowning.

47:50.300 --> 47:54.700
Just look at it like
Christmas spring cleaning.

47:54.834 --> 47:55.300
Thanks, Gia.

47:57.767 --> 47:59.967
Oh, my little sugar plum.

48:00.166 --> 48:02.100
I'm so happy you found him.

48:02.233 --> 48:04.033
You tracked him down
like a little hunter.

48:04.166 --> 48:05.200
I'm so proud of you.

48:05.333 --> 48:06.100
Now you made it weird.

48:06.233 --> 48:06.700
OK.

48:06.834 --> 48:07.967
Sorry.

48:08.100 --> 48:08.734
Thank you.

48:08.867 --> 48:09.433
Good job.

48:15.533 --> 48:16.934
Ooh, are you giving that away?

48:17.066 --> 48:18.233
Are you crazy?

48:18.367 --> 48:21.100
Girl, this is vintage couture.

48:21.233 --> 48:24.467
Excuse me.

48:24.600 --> 48:26.734
Stefon says Hello.

48:26.867 --> 48:29.300
He'll be off the road
in a couple of days.

48:29.433 --> 48:30.767
How are you guys doing?

48:30.900 --> 48:32.467
Great.

48:32.600 --> 48:33.800
OK, little sis.

48:33.934 --> 48:35.767
What's going on?

48:35.900 --> 48:37.233
Nothing.

48:37.367 --> 48:38.967
It's nothing.

48:39.100 --> 48:41.934
I just wish we had more time
to spend together, that's all.

48:42.066 --> 48:44.300
Well, that happens in
the best of marriages.

48:44.433 --> 48:46.467
What'd you guys do the
last time he came home?

48:46.600 --> 48:47.700
He slept.

48:47.834 --> 48:49.367
I worked.

48:49.500 --> 48:51.400
Well, therein lies the problem.

48:51.533 --> 48:52.400
You got to get out.

48:52.533 --> 48:54.200
You got to enjoy each other.

48:54.333 --> 48:55.600
Date night, right?

48:55.734 --> 48:57.400
Go to the movies, go dancing.

48:57.533 --> 48:59.266
You got to have fun.

48:59.400 --> 49:02.166
I mean, he's out on the road
putting in his hours and you

49:02.300 --> 49:03.467
always at the shop.

49:03.600 --> 49:06.800
I mean, you two
are just in a rut.

49:06.934 --> 49:07.667
OK.

49:07.800 --> 49:08.500
I know what you need.

49:08.633 --> 49:10.133
What?

49:10.266 --> 49:11.600
A makeover.

49:11.734 --> 49:12.667
No.

49:12.800 --> 49:13.500
Yes.

49:13.633 --> 49:14.700
You will feel sexy.

49:14.834 --> 49:16.166
You will feel rejuvenated.

49:16.300 --> 49:18.100
When am I going to have
time to do all that?

49:18.233 --> 49:20.133
I'm pulling 15 hour days.

49:20.266 --> 49:22.367
Hire more people.

49:22.500 --> 49:24.300
That's not going to happen.

49:24.433 --> 49:26.834
I just need to make it
through the holiday.

49:26.967 --> 49:28.533
OK.

49:28.667 --> 49:30.700
Well, I'm just going to go ahead
and schedule that makeover.

49:30.834 --> 49:32.934
And when Stefon sees
you, Oh, he going

49:33.066 --> 49:35.433
to be ready to unwrap
his Christmas gift.

49:35.567 --> 49:40.934
I can hear the bells already
just a tinkling, a tinkling.

49:41.066 --> 49:44.433
Jingle, jingle, jingle.

49:44.567 --> 49:48.667
Well, while you're trying
to reignite my fire,

49:48.800 --> 49:50.800
what are you going
to do about Wilson?

49:50.934 --> 49:52.266
Nothing.

49:52.400 --> 49:54.867
I mean, he's probably
completely insulted

49:55.000 --> 49:58.433
and thinks I'm a total snob.

49:58.567 --> 49:59.600
What?

49:59.734 --> 50:00.934
You think he's right?

50:01.066 --> 50:03.834
I will say that I was
a little surprised

50:03.967 --> 50:07.033
that you even took the time
out to do something like this.

50:07.166 --> 50:09.100
Something that
didn't benefit you

50:09.233 --> 50:09.633
OK.

50:09.767 --> 50:10.834
Wow.

50:10.967 --> 50:11.700
You're making me
sound so superficial.

50:11.834 --> 50:12.967
Really Marlow?

50:13.100 --> 50:13.834
I'm just saying.

50:13.967 --> 50:14.834
You are a little bougie.

50:14.967 --> 50:16.633
OK.

50:16.767 --> 50:18.200
Well, I guess it's better to be
a little bougie than to be very

50:18.333 --> 50:20.533
stubborn, because I reached
out to you several times

50:20.667 --> 50:21.533
and you just ignored me.

50:21.667 --> 50:23.100
I was busy.

50:23.233 --> 50:24.800
You were holding a grudge,
like you always have,

50:24.934 --> 50:26.266
ever since you were little.

50:26.400 --> 50:28.600
And you were being over
the top, like you always

50:28.734 --> 50:30.266
do for the longest.

50:30.400 --> 50:31.100
The longest?

50:31.233 --> 50:31.934
Really me?

50:32.066 --> 50:32.767
Yeah

50:32.900 --> 50:33.367
Marlow, come on now.

50:33.500 --> 50:34.266
I mean you--

50:34.400 --> 50:37.533
Marlow, you know what?

50:37.667 --> 50:38.100
Mm.

50:38.233 --> 50:39.967
Mm.

50:45.166 --> 50:47.467
I don't want to argue.

50:47.600 --> 50:51.800
I just, I want to spend
time with my sister,

50:51.934 --> 50:53.500
and my niece, my family.

50:56.934 --> 50:58.767
Your right.

50:58.900 --> 51:00.066
OK.

51:00.200 --> 51:01.934
Let me finish scheduling
this makeover.

51:02.066 --> 51:03.600
Wait, wait, wait.

51:03.734 --> 51:08.834
I will do the makeover only
if you reach out to Wilson.

51:08.967 --> 51:12.033
Text him and ask him what can
you do to make things right.

51:12.166 --> 51:13.867
OK that's not happening.

51:14.000 --> 51:15.233
It's a wrap.

51:15.367 --> 51:16.567
He's done.

51:16.700 --> 51:17.834
Dani.

51:17.967 --> 51:18.333
OK.

51:18.467 --> 51:19.066
Fine.

51:22.900 --> 51:24.567
Sorry about the other night.

51:24.700 --> 51:27.100
What can I do to make it right?

51:31.066 --> 51:31.700
OK.

51:31.834 --> 51:33.834
I see the dots.

51:33.967 --> 51:37.100
He's responding.

51:37.233 --> 51:41.033
Oh, they went away.

51:41.166 --> 51:43.433
Aww, you really liked this guy.

51:46.734 --> 51:49.500
Oh, more dots.

51:49.633 --> 51:53.266
He says meet me in
Washington Park at 6:00 AM.

51:53.400 --> 51:54.000
Hey.

51:54.133 --> 51:54.834
What?

51:54.967 --> 51:55.667
6 AM.

51:55.800 --> 51:57.100
Why would I do that?

51:57.233 --> 52:00.567
Because you want him to
see who you really are.

52:00.700 --> 52:01.533
Yeah, at brunch.

52:11.600 --> 52:12.734
All right.

52:12.867 --> 52:13.867
We going put the
blankets on this table.

52:14.000 --> 52:15.433
Hats and gloves
on this other one.

52:18.367 --> 52:18.800
OK.

52:18.934 --> 52:19.467
I'm here.

52:19.600 --> 52:20.300
I'm here.

52:20.433 --> 52:21.467
I'm sorry I'm late.

52:21.600 --> 52:23.567
I just stopped to
get some coffee.

52:23.700 --> 52:24.900
OK.

52:25.033 --> 52:26.367
Is that Dani Holiday
underneath all this?

52:26.500 --> 52:27.800
Well, who else is
wearing a fur in the park

52:27.934 --> 52:30.033
at this time in the morning?

52:30.166 --> 52:32.867
No one.

52:33.000 --> 52:33.533
All right.

52:33.667 --> 52:34.900
There you go.

52:35.033 --> 52:36.233
Here you go, brother.

52:36.367 --> 52:37.233
There you go.

52:37.367 --> 52:38.800
That should keep you warm.

52:38.934 --> 52:39.266
Bless you.

52:39.400 --> 52:39.967
Hey.

52:42.567 --> 52:45.800
Got to say, this
coffee hit the spot.

52:45.934 --> 52:48.133
Oh, I have some boxes
of clothing in the car.

52:48.266 --> 52:50.233
For your mother to bring
to the women's shelter.

52:50.367 --> 52:51.633
Thanks.

52:51.767 --> 52:53.633
I really appreciate your help.

52:53.767 --> 52:56.734
It's really hard finding
volunteers when we start early.

52:56.867 --> 52:58.767
I can't imagine why.

52:58.900 --> 53:01.266
I mean, my toes are
just frozen, that's all.

53:01.400 --> 53:04.033
It's probably those high heels.

53:04.166 --> 53:06.533
I'm sorry about
what my friend said.

53:06.667 --> 53:08.834
It was wrong.

53:08.967 --> 53:09.834
It was.

53:09.967 --> 53:11.500
But she said it, you didn't.

53:11.633 --> 53:14.667
I accept your apology

53:14.800 --> 53:16.266
So why are you still single?

53:16.400 --> 53:17.367
Wow.

53:17.500 --> 53:18.600
Is that what we're doing?

53:18.734 --> 53:20.200
Well, I got to ask.

53:20.333 --> 53:21.800
OK.

53:21.934 --> 53:25.100
Well, I guess I haven't
found the right person yet.

53:25.233 --> 53:26.800
What about you?

53:26.934 --> 53:32.867
I just, I guess I haven't found
the right person yet either.

53:33.000 --> 53:34.934
What a coincidence.

53:35.066 --> 53:36.967
You know someone
recently told me

53:37.100 --> 53:40.133
that everything
happens for a reason.

53:40.266 --> 53:42.600
They sound pretty smart.

53:42.734 --> 53:43.200
Mm.

53:44.633 --> 53:46.200
I better finish up.

53:46.333 --> 53:46.834
OK.

53:51.166 --> 53:56.934
Danny Holiday, would you
like to go out with me?

53:57.066 --> 53:59.467
I would, Wilson Whitlock.

53:59.600 --> 54:00.266
OK.

54:11.967 --> 54:12.734
Happy holidays.

54:12.867 --> 54:13.567
Thank you.

54:13.700 --> 54:17.667
Gia, pull order 542.

54:17.800 --> 54:18.600
Hey, Frank.

54:18.734 --> 54:19.266
You enjoying the holidays?

54:19.400 --> 54:21.000
Yes I am.

54:21.133 --> 54:23.867
I'm here to pick up my three
dozen pumpkin spice cupcakes.

54:24.000 --> 54:25.667
Frank, I don't see that order.

54:25.800 --> 54:27.600
Well, I spoke to you
about this two days ago

54:27.734 --> 54:29.166
remember it was my
wife's birthday I

54:29.300 --> 54:30.000
want to surprise her.

54:30.133 --> 54:31.667
I am so sorry, Frank.

54:31.800 --> 54:33.767
We've been really busy around
here I must have forgotten

54:33.900 --> 54:37.100
but if you come back at 6:00
I will have you ready for you.

54:37.233 --> 54:38.533
All right.

54:38.667 --> 54:40.867
Gia, take the next order for me.

54:41.000 --> 54:41.600
Happy holidays.

54:41.734 --> 54:43.734
How may I help you?

54:43.867 --> 54:45.000
Hey OK.

54:45.133 --> 54:46.834
So look, I know Stefon
gets in tonight,

54:46.967 --> 54:49.500
but I'm going to have to
cancel the salon appointment,

54:49.633 --> 54:50.934
and I may not make dinner.

54:51.066 --> 54:53.200
I have one of my regulars
with a huge order.

54:53.333 --> 54:54.166
Absolutely not.

54:54.300 --> 54:55.900
You are not canceling.

54:56.033 --> 54:59.367
I'll call Nick and I'll tell
him that there was an emergency.

54:59.500 --> 55:00.600
He'll work it out.

55:00.734 --> 55:02.066
And honestly, if
you leave now, you

55:02.200 --> 55:03.500
can get there and back by 4:00.

55:03.633 --> 55:04.400
No.

55:04.533 --> 55:05.266
Tracy's not here today.

55:05.400 --> 55:06.800
So it's just me and Gia.

55:06.934 --> 55:08.667
And you know she cannot
handle this place by herself.

55:08.800 --> 55:09.834
Fine.

55:09.967 --> 55:11.500
I'll come there
and work for you.

55:11.633 --> 55:12.567
No.

55:12.700 --> 55:14.300
You'll put me out of business.

55:14.433 --> 55:15.000
OK, look.

55:15.133 --> 55:17.734
I bake, kind of.

55:17.867 --> 55:19.333
I grew up in the
same kitchen you did.

55:19.467 --> 55:21.333
You could have fooled me.

55:21.467 --> 55:23.166
No, I just can't go.

55:23.300 --> 55:25.633
Yes, you can, because I made
reservations for you two

55:25.767 --> 55:28.967
at Godfrey's, and you
do not cancel on that.

55:29.100 --> 55:30.000
Come on.

55:30.133 --> 55:31.133
Your entire night is planned.

55:31.266 --> 55:34.967
Just put yourself
first, for once.

55:35.100 --> 55:36.500
You deserve this.

55:36.633 --> 55:37.000
All right.

55:37.133 --> 55:38.066
Fine.

55:38.200 --> 55:39.834
I will get the cupcakes started.

55:39.967 --> 55:41.667
All you got to do is
pull them out the oven.

55:41.800 --> 55:44.100
Do not burn my shop down.

55:44.233 --> 55:44.667
Don't worry.

55:44.800 --> 55:45.734
I won't.

55:45.867 --> 55:46.800
OK, bye.

55:51.767 --> 55:54.400
Did you notice that I only
burned one batch of cookies?

55:54.533 --> 55:56.133
You threw them away right?

55:56.266 --> 55:58.400
No, I sold them as
Cajun Christmas cookies.

55:58.533 --> 55:59.166
What?

55:59.300 --> 56:01.400
Girl, I'm joking.

56:01.533 --> 56:02.633
All right. pucker.

56:02.767 --> 56:04.700
Yes.

56:04.834 --> 56:05.734
OK.

56:05.867 --> 56:08.200
Oh, Stefon is parking.

56:08.333 --> 56:09.033
OK.

56:09.166 --> 56:09.834
Wow.

56:09.967 --> 56:11.233
You look gorgeous.

56:11.367 --> 56:12.467
And your hair.

56:12.600 --> 56:14.066
I mean, yes, yes.

56:14.200 --> 56:15.033
Thank you.

56:28.767 --> 56:29.734
Baby, you look incredible.

56:40.367 --> 56:41.333
I love you, mama.

56:41.467 --> 56:42.300
I love you too.

56:47.367 --> 56:51.567
It's that time of
the year when the snow drops

56:51.700 --> 56:52.867
are falling.

56:53.000 --> 56:54.700
The angels are calling.

56:54.834 --> 56:55.700
Oh.

56:55.834 --> 57:00.233
It's that time of the year.

57:00.367 --> 57:01.400
Good morning.

57:01.533 --> 57:03.734
Well, good morning.

57:03.867 --> 57:05.967
I see that the shop
is still standing.

57:06.100 --> 57:08.533
Mm-hmm.

57:08.667 --> 57:11.967
Oh, you are glowing.

57:12.100 --> 57:14.300
I had an amazing
time last night.

57:14.433 --> 57:15.700
Thank you so much.

57:15.834 --> 57:17.567
Stefon kept saying
how I look the way I

57:17.700 --> 57:19.266
did when he first met me.

57:20.266 --> 57:21.867
I love it.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.367
Did you ever get a
chance to grill RJ?

57:24.500 --> 57:26.066
Oh well, I haven't seen him.

57:26.200 --> 57:29.600
Well, this stocking was here
when I opened up this morning.

57:29.734 --> 57:30.400
Hey

57:30.533 --> 57:32.200
It's the last one.

57:32.333 --> 57:35.367
Oh it's a little bittersweet.

57:35.500 --> 57:36.967
It is.

57:37.100 --> 57:38.133
You know what?

57:38.266 --> 57:39.734
You got this.

57:39.867 --> 57:40.533
Me?

57:40.667 --> 57:41.100
All right.

57:41.233 --> 57:43.033
Let's see.

57:43.166 --> 57:46.800
Where did Mr. Snowman take
Mrs. Snowwoman for a night

57:46.934 --> 57:48.300
out on the town?

57:48.433 --> 57:49.967
I remember this one
from back in the day.

57:50.100 --> 57:51.233
To a snowball.

57:51.367 --> 57:53.800
It's so corny.

57:53.934 --> 57:56.934
Well, I think we should do
one of your favorite things.

57:57.066 --> 57:57.633
What's that?

57:57.767 --> 57:58.433
Throw a party.

57:58.567 --> 57:59.567
Hey.

57:59.700 --> 58:00.633
Oh, throw a party.

58:00.767 --> 58:02.200
Hey.

58:02.333 --> 58:03.700
Oh, for the foundation.

58:03.834 --> 58:05.667
Yes, I overheard
Wilson saying that he

58:05.800 --> 58:08.200
was looking for a sponsor to
throw a Christmas party for one

58:08.333 --> 58:09.333
of his kid's groups.

58:09.467 --> 58:11.800
Oh, OK.

58:11.934 --> 58:12.467
Party over here.

58:13.433 --> 58:14.266
A party over there.

58:14.400 --> 58:15.100
I said a party over here.

58:15.233 --> 58:16.200
And a party there.

58:16.333 --> 58:17.367
And a party over there.

58:17.500 --> 58:19.133
Hey, hey.

58:19.266 --> 58:20.133
Tracy.

58:20.266 --> 58:21.133
Tracy.

58:21.266 --> 58:21.934
Get it, girl.

58:32.667 --> 58:33.600
OK.

58:33.734 --> 58:34.867
You have got to stop doing that.

58:35.000 --> 58:35.834
You look happy.

58:35.967 --> 58:36.934
I did it.

58:37.066 --> 58:38.200
OK.

58:38.333 --> 58:40.834
They finally feel
like family again.

58:40.967 --> 58:43.000
What's wrong?

58:43.133 --> 58:44.433
It's not enough.

58:44.567 --> 58:46.200
You still have
unfinished business.

58:46.333 --> 58:47.500
What do you mean?

58:47.633 --> 58:49.934
I repaired my
sister's relationship.

58:50.066 --> 58:52.600
I haven't seen them this
close in a very long time.

58:52.734 --> 58:57.100
True, but there's
something else.

58:57.233 --> 58:59.200
You know, don't you?

58:59.333 --> 59:01.066
I have an idea.

59:01.200 --> 59:02.100
Can I have a hint?

59:02.233 --> 59:03.433
That would be cheating.

59:03.567 --> 59:04.500
I'm on your team.

59:04.633 --> 59:06.934
It's called an assist.

59:07.066 --> 59:07.667
Please.

59:17.400 --> 59:18.900
I hope you're good at riddles.

59:19.033 --> 59:19.667
Very funny.

59:30.533 --> 59:31.900
What if I can't figure it out?

59:34.500 --> 59:39.200
Then, this connection between
your sisters, might not last.

59:49.667 --> 59:52.333
Gently down to the ground.

59:52.467 --> 59:55.333
And they'll make their way
from the Christmas tree maze.

59:55.467 --> 59:56.967
Wow.

59:57.100 --> 1:00:00.133
I cannot believe you pulled
all of this off in one day.

1:00:00.266 --> 1:00:01.133
Yeah.

1:00:01.266 --> 1:00:02.500
What is this place?

1:00:02.633 --> 1:00:04.133
It's the House of Mercy.

1:00:04.266 --> 1:00:06.633
They provide shelter
for runaways, abused,

1:00:06.767 --> 1:00:07.834
and foster kids.

1:00:07.967 --> 1:00:09.567
That is awesome.

1:00:09.700 --> 1:00:11.200
Hello, ladies

1:00:11.333 --> 1:00:12.900
Hi Wilson.

1:00:13.033 --> 1:00:14.867
You know I was thinking that,
maybe we could use some more

1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:16.166
chairs here.

1:00:16.300 --> 1:00:17.567
Think there might
be some in storage.

1:00:17.700 --> 1:00:19.133
Want to come With?

1:00:19.266 --> 1:00:19.834
OK.

1:00:24.600 --> 1:00:27.033
You know, I might want to
volunteer at a place like this

1:00:27.166 --> 1:00:28.033
someday.

1:00:28.166 --> 1:00:30.834
Oh, my sweet little gumdrop.

1:00:30.967 --> 1:00:31.900
OK.

1:00:32.033 --> 1:00:32.500
Well, now you're
making it weird.

1:00:32.633 --> 1:00:33.000
OK.

1:00:33.133 --> 1:00:34.633
Sorry.

1:00:34.767 --> 1:00:37.400
Well, I promise you can go
sledding with your friends

1:00:37.533 --> 1:00:38.700
on Christmas Eve.

1:00:38.834 --> 1:00:39.533
Thanks.

1:00:39.667 --> 1:00:42.066
All right.

1:00:42.200 --> 1:00:44.667
Excuse me, can you
tell me where to find--

1:00:44.800 --> 1:00:46.233
Theresa?

1:00:46.367 --> 1:00:49.033
I have not seen you in years.

1:00:49.166 --> 1:00:50.166
Marlow.

1:00:50.300 --> 1:00:52.300
How are you?

1:00:52.433 --> 1:00:53.400
What are you doing here?

1:00:53.533 --> 1:00:55.133
Oh, Wake Up Now Chicago!

1:00:55.266 --> 1:00:56.700
Is doing a big piece on Dani
and "The Holiday Stocking."

1:00:56.834 --> 1:00:58.500
So we need to get behind
the scenes footage.

1:00:58.633 --> 1:00:59.867
A piece?

1:01:00.066 --> 1:01:02.100
A profile on her work
in the community.

1:01:02.233 --> 1:01:03.800
Our investor
insisted her company

1:01:03.934 --> 1:01:05.200
needed a charity facelift.

1:01:05.333 --> 1:01:07.400
I heard she even
gave you a makeover.

1:01:07.533 --> 1:01:08.934
You look amazing by the way.

1:01:09.066 --> 1:01:11.033
We'll be sure to get
you in the story.

1:01:11.166 --> 1:01:13.400
Does Danny know about this?

1:01:13.533 --> 1:01:14.734
We came up with it together.

1:01:14.867 --> 1:01:15.934
Check this out.

1:01:16.066 --> 1:01:17.734
What do Chicago's
advertising queen

1:01:17.867 --> 1:01:19.633
have inside her
holiday stocking?

1:01:19.767 --> 1:01:20.300
There she is.

1:01:20.433 --> 1:01:21.100
Get B-roll.

1:01:21.233 --> 1:01:23.100
Oh, Theresa.

1:01:23.233 --> 1:01:24.133
What are you doing here?

1:01:24.266 --> 1:01:26.400
So this was all about publicity?

1:01:26.533 --> 1:01:27.600
It's not what you're thinking.

1:01:27.734 --> 1:01:28.600
You know what?

1:01:28.734 --> 1:01:30.400
I cannot believe this, Dani.

1:01:30.533 --> 1:01:31.367
Actually I can.

1:01:31.500 --> 1:01:32.066
Marlow wait.

1:01:32.200 --> 1:01:33.367
Just listen.

1:01:33.500 --> 1:01:36.066
No, you did this for
yourself, as usual.

1:01:36.200 --> 1:01:38.400
It was never about
family and I fell for it.

1:01:38.533 --> 1:01:39.967
You have not changed.

1:01:40.100 --> 1:01:41.533
That is not true.

1:01:41.667 --> 1:01:42.934
Not all the way.

1:01:43.066 --> 1:01:45.266
I really wanted us
to be a family again.

1:01:45.400 --> 1:01:47.066
It was never about us

1:01:47.200 --> 1:01:48.600
Please, just let me explain.

1:01:48.734 --> 1:01:50.266
Why don't you save
the rest of your lives

1:01:50.400 --> 1:01:51.800
for your little interview.

1:01:51.934 --> 1:01:54.233
Gia, let's go.

1:01:54.367 --> 1:01:54.800
But--

1:01:54.934 --> 1:01:55.567
Now!

1:02:00.500 --> 1:02:01.033
What I miss?

1:02:11.233 --> 1:02:13.100
I promise this
wasn't just about me.

1:02:13.233 --> 1:02:14.934
I mean, at first, yes.

1:02:15.066 --> 1:02:17.367
But then I started
having fun and it

1:02:17.500 --> 1:02:19.433
wasn't about the business.

1:02:19.567 --> 1:02:20.467
So just talk to her.

1:02:20.600 --> 1:02:22.266
There is nothing to talk about.

1:02:22.400 --> 1:02:23.934
I don't ever want
to see her again.

1:02:24.066 --> 1:02:25.266
Honey, it can't be that bad.

1:02:25.400 --> 1:02:26.834
It is that bad.

1:02:26.967 --> 1:02:28.166
Just because she was the
one in the bakery with mom,

1:02:28.300 --> 1:02:29.967
doesn't mean she
gets to judge me.

1:02:30.100 --> 1:02:33.100
You know, she thinks she is the
only one whose made sacrifices.

1:02:33.233 --> 1:02:33.934
Is that true?

1:02:34.066 --> 1:02:35.433
OK.

1:02:35.567 --> 1:02:36.500
It's true that she helped
pay for mom's care,

1:02:36.633 --> 1:02:38.333
but she was never there.

1:02:38.467 --> 1:02:40.533
All the money in the
world can't replace that.

1:02:40.667 --> 1:02:42.467
Maybe that's the way
she shows her support.

1:02:42.600 --> 1:02:45.266
Well, I'm done with her.

1:02:47.834 --> 1:02:49.266
Maybe she was sincere.

1:02:49.400 --> 1:02:51.467
No, she was exploiting this.

1:02:51.600 --> 1:02:54.533
And then to drag me in it
like I'm some charity case

1:02:54.667 --> 1:02:57.367
like, Ooh poor homely Marlow.

1:02:57.500 --> 1:02:58.300
She said that?

1:02:58.433 --> 1:03:00.700
Probably, behind my back.

1:03:00.834 --> 1:03:03.033
I just think you
need to hear her out.

1:03:03.166 --> 1:03:04.200
I do too.

1:03:04.333 --> 1:03:05.867
That party was going
to be lit, mom.

1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:08.233
This is not about
you having fun.

1:03:08.367 --> 1:03:10.033
Really?

1:03:10.166 --> 1:03:11.600
You're the one who wanted me to
see that volunteering was fun.

1:03:11.734 --> 1:03:13.033
Those were your words.

1:03:13.166 --> 1:03:15.567
Girl, stop using my words
to prove your point.

1:03:15.700 --> 1:03:16.934
Thanks for ruining my Christmas!

1:03:17.066 --> 1:03:19.500
You're welcome.

1:03:19.633 --> 1:03:20.400
I'm going to go check.

1:03:20.533 --> 1:03:21.834
Yeah, you do that.

1:03:23.734 --> 1:03:24.433
Oh, my.

1:03:24.567 --> 1:03:25.433
Ugh.

1:03:29.900 --> 1:03:30.533
We need to talk.

1:03:30.667 --> 1:03:31.233
Oh no.

1:03:31.367 --> 1:03:32.100
Wait a minute.

1:03:32.233 --> 1:03:33.667
What are you doing here?

1:03:33.800 --> 1:03:34.934
The game is done.

1:03:35.066 --> 1:03:36.333
No, this riddle is
for me to answer.

1:03:36.467 --> 1:03:37.266
Here, read it.

1:03:37.400 --> 1:03:38.233
No, no, no, no, no, honey.

1:03:38.367 --> 1:03:39.600
I'm not reading anything.

1:03:39.734 --> 1:03:41.333
None of Robert's people
even know who you are.

1:03:41.467 --> 1:03:42.000
I'm sorry.

1:03:42.133 --> 1:03:42.867
OK.

1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:45.800
Well, Robert is sorry.

1:03:48.633 --> 1:03:49.900
You know what?

1:03:50.033 --> 1:03:51.200
I'm just going to read
this riddle myself.

1:03:55.367 --> 1:03:58.033
Why did it take the giraffe
so long to apologize?

1:03:58.166 --> 1:03:58.600
I don't know.

1:03:58.734 --> 1:04:00.800
Why?

1:04:00.934 --> 1:04:04.767
Because it took him forever
to swallow his pride.

1:04:04.900 --> 1:04:07.100
Robert was going
through marriage issues

1:04:07.233 --> 1:04:09.567
and financial problems.

1:04:09.700 --> 1:04:15.800
He's sorry he couldn't,
didn't prioritize better.

1:04:15.934 --> 1:04:18.233
Where's all this coming from?

1:04:18.367 --> 1:04:20.500
Some of his final
words to me were

1:04:20.633 --> 1:04:24.233
that he should have
been more involved

1:04:24.367 --> 1:04:26.600
in taking care of your mother.

1:04:26.734 --> 1:04:29.567
He felt she only
listened to you, which is

1:04:29.700 --> 1:04:33.133
why he let you handle it all.

1:04:33.266 --> 1:04:35.934
But that's no excuse.

1:04:36.066 --> 1:04:38.467
How do know all this?

1:04:38.600 --> 1:04:40.800
Robert didn't have
a lot of friends.

1:04:40.934 --> 1:04:42.233
So he confided in me.

1:04:46.867 --> 1:04:51.734
I just hope this
brings you some peace.

1:04:51.867 --> 1:04:55.900
And I hope you can find it
in your heart to forgive him,

1:04:56.033 --> 1:04:58.500
because he truly loves
his baby sister, cricket.

1:05:02.467 --> 1:05:04.867
Merry Christmas.

1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:05.533
Merry Christmas.

1:05:13.633 --> 1:05:15.000
Yes, Teresa.

1:05:15.133 --> 1:05:18.300
I will see you at the
studio in the morning.

1:05:18.433 --> 1:05:20.567
No, no, you don't
have to apologize.

1:05:20.700 --> 1:05:23.533
You didn't do anything.

1:05:23.667 --> 1:05:24.000
Yeah.

1:05:24.133 --> 1:05:24.834
OK.

1:05:24.967 --> 1:05:25.567
I'll see you there.

1:05:25.700 --> 1:05:26.367
Bye.

1:05:50.934 --> 1:05:54.867
Ask mother
pine in the air.

1:05:55.000 --> 1:05:58.166
My favorite time of the year.

1:05:58.300 --> 1:06:02.100
There stringing up
lights everywhere.

1:06:02.233 --> 1:06:04.567
Cups overflowing with cheer.

1:06:04.700 --> 1:06:08.133
Soft snow is falling
and my heart is calling.

1:06:08.266 --> 1:06:11.533
I'm falling so in love with you.

1:06:11.667 --> 1:06:13.233
Merry Christmas.

1:06:13.367 --> 1:06:15.600
Merry Christmas.

1:06:15.734 --> 1:06:18.700
Holla if you want to have
a happy holiday with me.

1:06:28.767 --> 1:06:32.200
Happy holiday.

1:06:32.333 --> 1:06:34.133
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:06:34.266 --> 1:06:35.266
Happy holiday.

1:06:38.867 --> 1:06:39.700
You doing OK?

1:06:39.834 --> 1:06:41.266
Happy holiday.

1:06:44.033 --> 1:06:46.934
All these years, I
thought my sisters

1:06:47.066 --> 1:06:49.233
were the only ones that fought.

1:06:49.367 --> 1:06:52.433
I never saw my part in
any of this until now.

1:06:55.900 --> 1:07:00.633
I just can't believe my
sisters aren't talking again.

1:07:00.767 --> 1:07:03.200
I know you want things
to be right between them,

1:07:03.333 --> 1:07:08.100
but at least you can have peace
in knowing that you tried.

1:07:08.233 --> 1:07:13.633
If it takes up until the very
last minute, I can't give up.

1:07:13.767 --> 1:07:18.333
In 48 hours, your
12 days are up.

1:07:18.467 --> 1:07:20.367
I know.

1:07:20.500 --> 1:07:22.066
And I am praying for a miracle.

1:07:32.734 --> 1:07:33.734
Thanks for waiting for me.

1:07:33.867 --> 1:07:35.433
I wouldn't have
it any other way.

1:07:35.567 --> 1:07:38.500
You know I had to have my
man put the star on the tree.

1:07:42.600 --> 1:07:45.500
Baby, what's wrong?

1:07:45.633 --> 1:07:47.433
Nothing.

1:07:47.567 --> 1:07:50.166
I just miss us spending
time together as a family.

1:07:50.300 --> 1:07:57.066
And I wish that Gia would
know how much she means to me.

1:07:57.200 --> 1:07:59.333
I'm sure she does.

1:07:59.467 --> 1:08:00.200
Hey guys.

1:08:00.333 --> 1:08:02.000
Hey Gigi.

1:08:02.133 --> 1:08:04.700
So what time are you going to
go sledding with your friends?

1:08:04.834 --> 1:08:07.333
I don't think I want to
go with them anymore.

1:08:07.467 --> 1:08:08.133
Baby, what's wrong?

1:08:08.266 --> 1:08:09.700
Nothing.

1:08:09.834 --> 1:08:12.800
But we haven't gone sledding
as a family in years.

1:08:12.934 --> 1:08:14.166
I thought it might be fun.

1:08:14.300 --> 1:08:15.400
Wait a minute.

1:08:15.533 --> 1:08:17.500
You want to come with us?

1:08:17.633 --> 1:08:19.700
Yes.

1:08:19.834 --> 1:08:21.200
Can I invite Jamal?

1:08:21.333 --> 1:08:22.066
Whose Jamal?

1:08:22.200 --> 1:08:22.667
You sure can.

1:08:22.800 --> 1:08:23.633
Yes, honey.

1:08:23.767 --> 1:08:25.500
He better be a snowman!

1:08:25.633 --> 1:08:27.333
Gia, Who is Jamal?

1:08:27.467 --> 1:08:28.066
Been talking to.

1:08:33.767 --> 1:08:35.367
This is going to be so much fun.

1:08:35.500 --> 1:08:38.834
I'm so happy you decided
you wanted to come with us.

1:08:38.967 --> 1:08:40.033
Now, you're making it weird.

1:08:40.166 --> 1:08:40.667
OK.

1:08:40.800 --> 1:08:41.233
I'm sorry.

1:08:41.367 --> 1:08:41.834
You ready?

1:08:41.967 --> 1:08:42.500
Yeah.

1:08:47.467 --> 1:08:48.500
Hey, not so close!

1:08:58.767 --> 1:09:00.767
She's growing up.

1:09:00.900 --> 1:09:01.633
I'm not ready.

1:09:01.767 --> 1:09:02.400
Me either.

1:09:06.734 --> 1:09:07.433
See you down there.

1:09:16.100 --> 1:09:17.633
What are you doing here?

1:09:17.767 --> 1:09:19.433
RJ.

1:09:19.567 --> 1:09:20.533
How does he even--

1:09:20.667 --> 1:09:22.066
You know what?

1:09:22.200 --> 1:09:22.867
Never mind.

1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:23.734
Have a good time.

1:09:23.867 --> 1:09:25.066
OK.

1:09:25.200 --> 1:09:26.233
I should have told you
about the publicity.

1:09:26.367 --> 1:09:28.133
I shouldn't have
kept it a secret.

1:09:28.266 --> 1:09:31.233
I just, I didn't think
you'd understand.

1:09:31.367 --> 1:09:34.633
And I know that I can
be selfish at times.

1:09:34.767 --> 1:09:40.500
But my time with you and Gia
had nothing to do with work.

1:09:42.934 --> 1:09:45.967
Say something.

1:09:46.100 --> 1:09:49.700
This is the first day off
I've had in two years.

1:09:49.834 --> 1:09:53.967
I just want to enjoy
it with my family.

1:09:54.100 --> 1:09:54.967
Are you serious?

1:09:55.100 --> 1:09:56.633
Yes.

1:09:56.767 --> 1:09:59.467
I have been working like crazy
to keep mom's shop running.

1:09:59.600 --> 1:10:01.567
We lost a lot of
clients when mom passed.

1:10:01.700 --> 1:10:04.100
So I've been rebuilding
and it's hard to keep

1:10:04.233 --> 1:10:06.967
all the balls in the air
and keep a smile on my face

1:10:07.100 --> 1:10:08.100
like everything's great.

1:10:08.233 --> 1:10:09.400
Well, I didn't know.

1:10:09.533 --> 1:10:10.967
I just figured you
wanted to handle it.

1:10:11.100 --> 1:10:13.300
And that you didn't
want me involved.

1:10:13.433 --> 1:10:16.800
I mean, you always seem like you
have everything under control.

1:10:16.934 --> 1:10:19.967
You are a hard nut
to crack, Marlow.

1:10:20.100 --> 1:10:20.934
Have you met you?

1:10:28.533 --> 1:10:30.133
All right.

1:10:30.266 --> 1:10:33.433
I understand why you didn't say
anything, but I'm your sister.

1:10:33.567 --> 1:10:34.867
You should be able
to come to me.

1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:36.300
Yeah, and I'm your
sister, and you

1:10:36.433 --> 1:10:38.767
should be able to come
to me when you need help.

1:10:38.900 --> 1:10:40.800
I promise.

1:10:40.934 --> 1:10:44.233
I promise to do better.

1:10:44.367 --> 1:10:48.400
Just so tired of having
to be strong all the time.

1:10:51.900 --> 1:10:54.066
Well, then just let go.

1:10:54.200 --> 1:10:57.900
You don't have to be anything,
but my little sister.

1:11:01.066 --> 1:11:02.967
Cricket, I love you.

1:11:03.100 --> 1:11:03.867
I love you too.

1:11:08.800 --> 1:11:09.834
OK.

1:11:09.967 --> 1:11:13.266
We going to freeze
our faces off.

1:11:13.400 --> 1:11:14.967
Now, look.

1:11:15.100 --> 1:11:17.033
I'm still doing that
interview tomorrow,

1:11:17.166 --> 1:11:22.600
but just know that my
time with my family

1:11:22.734 --> 1:11:26.100
had nothing to do with business.

1:11:26.233 --> 1:11:26.867
We'll be watching.

1:11:30.567 --> 1:11:31.633
Wait a minute.

1:11:31.767 --> 1:11:33.200
I think he's looking for you.

1:11:36.633 --> 1:11:38.200
I'll meet you on the way down.

1:11:38.333 --> 1:11:38.934
OK.

1:11:44.166 --> 1:11:46.000
Whoo!

1:11:46.133 --> 1:11:46.700
Yeah!

1:11:54.467 --> 1:11:55.700
What are you doing here?

1:11:55.834 --> 1:11:57.533
RJ.

1:11:57.667 --> 1:12:00.266
How does he-- it
doesn't even matter.

1:12:00.400 --> 1:12:01.567
Thank you for coming.

1:12:01.700 --> 1:12:03.233
Are you kidding me?

1:12:03.367 --> 1:12:06.600
This is the highlight
of my holiday.

1:12:06.734 --> 1:12:08.033
Sledding?

1:12:08.166 --> 1:12:09.200
Sledding with you.

1:12:11.800 --> 1:12:13.066
You ready?

1:12:14.133 --> 1:12:15.200
OK.

1:12:15.333 --> 1:12:18.867
Wait.

1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:20.934
I'm not going to get hurt, am I?

1:12:21.066 --> 1:12:25.734
Not if you trust me
and hold on tight.

1:12:25.867 --> 1:12:28.266
Just one more thing
for good luck.

1:12:37.633 --> 1:12:40.266
Yeah, I think we're ready.

1:12:40.400 --> 1:12:41.166
Let's go.

1:12:41.300 --> 1:12:42.033
You get on front.

1:12:53.066 --> 1:12:54.934
So make sure to mention
that one of your clients

1:12:55.066 --> 1:12:56.667
just want to Clio.

1:12:56.800 --> 1:12:58.700
Some bullet points that say
you've been doing the Holiday

1:12:58.834 --> 1:13:00.467
Stocking since you were a kid.

1:13:00.600 --> 1:13:02.767
And that community service
runs in your family's blood.

1:13:02.900 --> 1:13:03.500
Are you nervous?

1:13:03.633 --> 1:13:04.300
I'm not nervous.

1:13:04.433 --> 1:13:05.233
Do I seem nervous?

1:13:05.367 --> 1:13:06.100
You seem a little nervous.

1:13:06.233 --> 1:13:06.734
I'm a little nervous.

1:13:06.867 --> 1:13:07.467
OK listen.

1:13:07.600 --> 1:13:08.500
I got this, T.

1:13:14.266 --> 1:13:16.333
Christmas is upon
us and all week long

1:13:16.467 --> 1:13:18.500
we've been hearing
beautiful stories about how

1:13:18.633 --> 1:13:20.767
Chi-town's best celebrate.

1:13:20.900 --> 1:13:22.967
With us today is Dani holiday.

1:13:23.100 --> 1:13:26.133
Owner and CEO of
DHH Advertising.

1:13:26.266 --> 1:13:29.433
She and her company have found
unique ways to celebrate.

1:13:29.567 --> 1:13:30.633
Welcome, Dani.

1:13:30.767 --> 1:13:32.233
Thank you.

1:13:32.367 --> 1:13:35.567
So tell me, why have you and
DHH Advertising partnered

1:13:35.700 --> 1:13:37.066
with Friends of Chicago?

1:13:37.200 --> 1:13:39.633
Well, DHH is all about
community service,

1:13:39.767 --> 1:13:42.133
and during the holidays
it's especially important

1:13:42.266 --> 1:13:44.400
to take time to give back.

1:13:44.533 --> 1:13:47.633
And I genuinely feel
that we should--

1:13:50.467 --> 1:13:53.467
Well, actually during
this time of year

1:13:53.600 --> 1:13:54.834
it's always important to--

1:13:57.433 --> 1:14:03.667
that I really want to
make it clear that--

1:14:03.800 --> 1:14:06.467
Actually, I don't want
to talk about DHH.

1:14:06.600 --> 1:14:09.533
Oh, OK.

1:14:09.667 --> 1:14:13.734
Christmas was a big deal in
my family, when I was young.

1:14:13.867 --> 1:14:18.300
We didn't grow up with a
lot, but when my father died,

1:14:18.433 --> 1:14:20.900
it got even harder.

1:14:21.033 --> 1:14:25.967
But we played this game,
"The Holiday Stocking."

1:14:26.100 --> 1:14:29.133
We would pull a riddle
from a card in a stocking

1:14:29.266 --> 1:14:31.467
and whoever got
the right answer,

1:14:31.600 --> 1:14:34.000
first, got to choose
what volunteer

1:14:34.133 --> 1:14:35.533
work the family would do.

1:14:35.667 --> 1:14:37.000
So interesting.

1:14:37.133 --> 1:14:41.200
So you focused on giving,
instead of receiving.

1:14:41.333 --> 1:14:45.533
Yes, but I haven't
been giving in a while.

1:14:45.667 --> 1:14:51.033
I've been too busy building
and maybe even taking.

1:14:54.300 --> 1:14:57.467
But this holiday, my
sister Marlow and I

1:14:57.600 --> 1:14:59.900
brought back the holiday
stocking tradition.

1:15:00.100 --> 1:15:06.934
And it just opened a part of my
heart that I forgot was there.

1:15:07.066 --> 1:15:11.900
This holiday I realized that
spending time with my family

1:15:12.033 --> 1:15:17.600
and connecting with my community
is what's most important to me.

1:15:17.734 --> 1:15:25.533
So I have decided to step down
as president and CEO of DHH.

1:15:25.667 --> 1:15:26.800
Oh, OK.

1:15:26.934 --> 1:15:30.367
Yeah, I'm stepping
down and I'm leaving

1:15:30.500 --> 1:15:34.767
the company in the very
capable hands of my amazing VP

1:15:34.900 --> 1:15:36.700
and friend Teresa Fields.

1:15:36.834 --> 1:15:41.233
So that I can fully devote
my time and resources

1:15:41.367 --> 1:15:43.033
to organizations
that really make

1:15:43.166 --> 1:15:44.934
an impact in our community.

1:15:45.066 --> 1:15:48.233
And of course, to
reconnect with my family.

1:15:48.367 --> 1:15:51.967
I may even help my
sister run her bakery.

1:15:52.100 --> 1:15:54.633
The holiday bakery for
all your baking needs.

1:15:54.767 --> 1:15:59.734
Well, that is a very powerful
statement you shared with us.

1:15:59.867 --> 1:16:02.000
OK that is my
sister right there.

1:16:02.133 --> 1:16:02.867
That's my sister.

1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:04.500
In case you didn't know.

1:16:04.633 --> 1:16:07.633
That's my sister.

1:16:07.767 --> 1:16:08.367
Thank you.

1:16:12.166 --> 1:16:14.166
What did you just do?

1:16:14.300 --> 1:16:18.033
Something I probably should
have done a long time ago.

1:16:18.166 --> 1:16:20.033
Ben just called.

1:16:20.166 --> 1:16:22.000
We got the funding.

1:16:22.133 --> 1:16:23.600
The investor watched
your show and was

1:16:23.734 --> 1:16:25.266
moved by your sincerity.

1:16:26.800 --> 1:16:27.633
We did it.

1:16:27.767 --> 1:16:28.533
We did it.

1:16:31.900 --> 1:16:32.600
Come on.

1:16:32.734 --> 1:16:36.500
Mm, mm, mm, yeah.

1:16:36.633 --> 1:16:38.633
We do have to talk
about resigning though.

1:16:38.767 --> 1:16:39.667
OK.

1:16:39.800 --> 1:16:40.433
We can talk about that later.

1:16:57.133 --> 1:17:00.133
Well, congratulations.

1:17:00.266 --> 1:17:03.500
It looks like your
work here is done.

1:17:03.633 --> 1:17:07.300
Wait, I have one more
thing I have to do.

1:17:07.433 --> 1:17:09.834
You are stalling more than
an overheated hooptie.

1:17:09.967 --> 1:17:12.367
Seriously, it's important.

1:17:12.500 --> 1:17:15.467
I need you to show me how
to do that angel magic.

1:17:15.600 --> 1:17:17.066
There's nothing left to do.

1:17:17.200 --> 1:17:21.033
I still have one more day to
give them my Christmas gift.

1:17:21.166 --> 1:17:23.834
One more day.

1:17:23.967 --> 1:17:24.567
Wait.

1:17:24.700 --> 1:17:25.900
The magic.

1:17:26.033 --> 1:17:28.567
I'm focusing, but my
snaps aren't working

1:17:31.867 --> 1:17:38.600
An angel's magic isn't in our
fingers, it's in our hearts.

1:17:38.734 --> 1:17:45.567
Now that yours is
complete, try again.

1:18:04.266 --> 1:18:08.233
Hark the
harold angels sing.

1:18:08.367 --> 1:18:12.734
Glory to the newborn king.

1:18:12.867 --> 1:18:17.166
Peace on Earth and mercy mild.

1:18:17.300 --> 1:18:20.533
God and sinners reconciled.

1:18:24.367 --> 1:18:29.467
The first Noel.

1:18:29.600 --> 1:18:33.967
The angels did sing.

1:18:34.100 --> 1:18:44.066
Was to certain poor shepherds
in fields as they lay.

1:18:44.367 --> 1:18:46.100
Our family photo.

1:18:46.233 --> 1:18:47.433
Look at you.

1:18:47.567 --> 1:18:48.433
Look at that face.

1:18:48.567 --> 1:18:50.834
Look at that face.

1:18:50.967 --> 1:18:54.000
Oh my goodness.

1:18:54.133 --> 1:18:58.767
I mean, this is decorated
like our old home.

1:18:58.900 --> 1:19:01.000
This is so strange.

1:19:01.133 --> 1:19:02.400
Speaking of strange,
did your phone

1:19:02.533 --> 1:19:04.367
start to play mama's song?

1:19:04.500 --> 1:19:07.066
It sure did.

1:19:07.200 --> 1:19:07.967
OK.

1:19:08.100 --> 1:19:08.667
You don't think that--

1:19:08.800 --> 1:19:11.033
What?

1:19:11.166 --> 1:19:14.033
You know that's crazy.

1:19:14.166 --> 1:19:16.633
Surprise.

1:19:16.767 --> 1:19:18.800
Merry Christmas.

1:19:18.934 --> 1:19:20.500
I hope you like it.

1:19:20.633 --> 1:19:22.800
Tracy let me in.

1:19:22.934 --> 1:19:23.967
RJ.

1:19:24.100 --> 1:19:27.033
This is beautiful.

1:19:27.166 --> 1:19:29.000
Your box, as promised.

1:19:29.133 --> 1:19:30.500
OK.

1:19:30.633 --> 1:19:32.400
Don't tell me this is also
a part of Robert's plan.

1:19:32.533 --> 1:19:35.867
No, but he told me that
you always exchange gifts,

1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:38.066
and he didn't leave me
anything to give you.

1:19:38.200 --> 1:19:43.166
So I thought this
would be perfect.

1:19:43.300 --> 1:19:45.333
Ooh, what?

1:19:45.467 --> 1:19:46.367
My old camera.

1:19:46.500 --> 1:19:47.800
Mama kept it.

1:19:47.934 --> 1:19:49.467
Girl, look at this.

1:19:49.600 --> 1:19:51.133
This is mama's old apron.

1:19:51.266 --> 1:19:52.633
Now, you know when
she put this on,

1:19:52.767 --> 1:19:55.000
she was getting in
that kitchen to burn.

1:19:55.133 --> 1:19:57.500
I'm going to wear this today.

1:19:57.633 --> 1:19:58.567
It's midnight.

1:19:58.700 --> 1:19:59.867
Oh, OK.

1:20:00.000 --> 1:20:02.834
Well, I guess it's
officially Christmas.

1:20:05.767 --> 1:20:09.133
So Danny and I, we're going
to have dinner and Wilson

1:20:09.266 --> 1:20:09.867
will be there.

1:20:10.000 --> 1:20:11.066
You should come.

1:20:11.200 --> 1:20:13.200
Yeah, you should
bring your family.

1:20:13.333 --> 1:20:17.033
I wish I could, but I can't.

1:20:17.166 --> 1:20:19.233
Well, will you at least
come back for a visit?

1:20:23.867 --> 1:20:28.033
Ladies, I have to go,
but I hope you have

1:20:28.166 --> 1:20:32.834
a very, very Merry Christmas.

1:20:32.967 --> 1:20:37.734
And remember the best gift
at Christmas are things--

1:20:37.867 --> 1:20:39.300
That money can't buy.

1:20:43.633 --> 1:20:45.834
Yeah.

1:20:45.967 --> 1:20:46.533
RJ?

1:20:49.033 --> 1:20:51.200
Yeah.

1:20:51.333 --> 1:20:54.133
We just wanted to
thank you for--

1:20:54.266 --> 1:20:57.033
For everything.

1:20:57.166 --> 1:20:57.700
Thank you.

1:21:10.200 --> 1:21:11.233
I have to go.

1:21:14.100 --> 1:21:16.900
I have to go.

1:21:17.033 --> 1:21:17.600
OK.

1:21:54.834 --> 1:21:55.800
He dropped his pendant.

1:21:59.166 --> 1:21:59.734
RJ!

1:22:03.400 --> 1:22:04.467
Which way did he go?

1:22:04.600 --> 1:22:08.100
Either he drives very fast or--

1:22:08.233 --> 1:22:08.800
No.

1:22:11.133 --> 1:22:12.333
Oh look, it's starting to snow.

1:22:59.133 --> 1:23:00.734
Wow.

1:23:00.867 --> 1:23:04.266
Well, as mama would say, another
angel's getting their wings.

1:23:04.400 --> 1:23:05.600
Hark!

1:23:05.734 --> 1:23:09.500
The Herald angels sing.

1:23:09.633 --> 1:23:15.900
Glory to the newborn king.

1:23:16.033 --> 1:23:17.700
Merry Christmas cricket.

1:23:17.834 --> 1:23:18.934
Merry Christmas.

1:23:20.333 --> 1:23:22.700
God and
sinners reconciled.

1:23:22.834 --> 1:23:26.500
Joyful all ye nations rise.

1:23:26.633 --> 1:23:30.333
Join the triumph of the skies.

1:23:30.467 --> 1:23:31.533
Hark!

1:23:31.667 --> 1:23:34.200
The herald the
herald angels sing.

1:23:34.333 --> 1:23:38.100
Glory to the newborn king--
