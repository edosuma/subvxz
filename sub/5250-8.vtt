00:18.170 --> 00:20.171
I love show business!

00:20.172 --> 00:22.608
Do bankers or doctors
get a breakfast tent?

00:22.609 --> 00:24.041
No, suckers.

00:24.042 --> 00:26.042
This croissant is heaven, right?

00:26.043 --> 00:28.144
Hey, this is Craft services for the cast

00:28.145 --> 00:29.248
and crew of The Good Wife only.

00:29.249 --> 00:30.548
We're both.

00:30.549 --> 00:33.149
He's a grip, and I'm playing the judge.

00:33.150 --> 00:34.718
Oh god, oh, come on, guys.

00:34.719 --> 00:36.253
This is what it's come to,

00:36.254 --> 00:37.721
stealing food from Julianna Margulies.

00:37.722 --> 00:39.591
Yeah, well how else am I
supposed to feed myself?

00:39.592 --> 00:41.726
It's Christmas re-run season.

00:41.727 --> 00:43.693
I don't have any recap money until January

00:43.694 --> 00:45.462
when The Bachelor starts up again.

00:45.463 --> 00:46.565
I know, my tips are crap.

00:46.566 --> 00:48.032
The cafe is dead.

00:48.033 --> 00:49.032
I'm worried I'm not gonna be able

00:49.033 --> 00:50.200
to pay the band for our show.

00:50.201 --> 00:52.202
I know, we have to figure something out.

00:52.203 --> 00:54.437
I think I'm gonna get some
money from my brother.

00:54.438 --> 00:55.705
Gary's wife went to Israel

00:55.706 --> 00:57.340
because of course she did,

00:57.341 --> 00:58.308
so now they're gonna pay me

00:58.309 --> 00:59.609
to pick up their awkward daughter

00:59.610 --> 01:01.611
and take her to her Latin
tutor a few times a week.

01:01.612 --> 01:03.982
Well, why should gentiles be the only ones

01:03.983 --> 01:07.451
roped into Christmas family bullshit?

01:07.452 --> 01:09.219
Why are there still so
many drunk Santas around,

01:09.220 --> 01:10.756
isn't Santa Con of a one day thing?

01:10.757 --> 01:11.722
It was.

01:11.723 --> 01:13.358
They made it a week so that New York

01:13.359 --> 01:15.092
could fleece bar crawlers

01:15.093 --> 01:17.360
for even more of their dirtbag money.

01:17.361 --> 01:18.463
Fucking DiBlasio!

01:18.464 --> 01:19.530
I know, right?

01:19.531 --> 01:20.431
Fuck him!

01:20.432 --> 01:21.400
I like his wife.

01:21.401 --> 01:23.668
She's cool.

01:23.669 --> 01:24.402
Asshole!

01:24.403 --> 01:25.503
What the fuck?

01:25.504 --> 01:28.405
Why can't things be
easier for us, you know?

01:28.406 --> 01:30.473
Why do we have to be
miserable all the time?

01:30.474 --> 01:31.341
I know, what will it take for us

01:31.342 --> 01:32.678
to experience joy during this,

01:32.679 --> 01:36.280
the most magical time of the year?

01:46.658 --> 01:48.225
It's okay, Matthew.

01:48.226 --> 01:49.461
You can't ruin my favorite tradition

01:49.462 --> 01:50.661
with one mistake.

01:50.662 --> 01:52.162
I thought that secret Santa meant

01:52.163 --> 01:55.432
I tell a secret to the
person whose name I picked.

01:55.433 --> 01:57.302
Which is why you now know
about all the things

01:57.303 --> 01:59.470
I'd like to do on J.K. Simmons.

01:59.471 --> 02:00.705
I sure do.

02:00.706 --> 02:03.141
Baby, you wanna reveal whose
secret Santa you are?

02:03.142 --> 02:04.141
It was Billy.

02:04.142 --> 02:06.009
Yeah, I figured once I unwrapped my gift

02:06.010 --> 02:08.078
and saw that it was an old In Touch Weekly

02:08.079 --> 02:09.645
with your hair salon's address on it.

02:09.646 --> 02:11.147
You love all that celebrity shit.

02:11.148 --> 02:12.484
Just say thank you, God.

02:12.485 --> 02:14.218
Thank you.

02:14.219 --> 02:16.088
Only 25 things I didn't know

02:16.089 --> 02:19.256
about Melissa Gorga can save this day.

02:19.257 --> 02:23.494
Oh, and look, celebrity
gay dads, how cute.

02:23.495 --> 02:24.561
Yeah, Neil Patrick Harris,

02:24.562 --> 02:25.597
Ricky Martin, Perez Hilton,

02:25.598 --> 02:28.633
and Denis O'Hare take their little kiddos

02:28.634 --> 02:31.702
to My Dancing Divas dance
studio in Tribeca.

02:31.703 --> 02:33.337
I love Denis O'Hare.

02:33.338 --> 02:35.138
A sentence I didn't
expect to hear from you.

02:35.139 --> 02:36.206
He's in that new Marvel movie.

02:36.207 --> 02:37.340
Yeah, the Bryan Singer one.

02:37.341 --> 02:38.642
Bryan Singer, another gay dad.

02:38.643 --> 02:41.011
Boy, these gay dads have a
lot of high-profile gigs.

02:41.012 --> 02:43.113
Oh yeah, it's the gay dad mafia.

02:43.114 --> 02:44.748
I mean, that dance school is the center

02:44.749 --> 02:46.583
of show business in New York right now.

02:46.584 --> 02:48.251
You can practical smell Alan Cumming

02:48.252 --> 02:49.788
looking for a surrogate.

02:49.789 --> 02:52.023
Honey, why don't you close up?

02:52.024 --> 02:53.725
Matty and I are gonna go hat shopping,

02:53.726 --> 02:55.259
just to be whimsical.

02:55.260 --> 02:56.726
And I'll get the tree.

02:56.727 --> 02:58.161
Billy, you can come with.

02:58.162 --> 02:59.229
Oh actually, I was gonna see if you guys

02:59.230 --> 03:01.398
wanted me to work an extra shift tomorrow.

03:01.399 --> 03:04.134
Look around, Billy McGoo,
restaurant is dead.

03:04.135 --> 03:05.135
Come on, Matty.

03:05.136 --> 03:06.403
Oh, hey, Billy, if you need some money,

03:06.404 --> 03:07.303
have you thought about a career

03:07.304 --> 03:09.339
- in the entertainment industry?
- Shut up, man.

03:09.340 --> 03:11.341
No, no, no, I hear The
Mysteries of Laura is hiring.

03:11.342 --> 03:12.742
Maybe one of their mysteries can be

03:12.743 --> 03:15.245
why don't cute pants come in Billy's size?

03:15.246 --> 03:16.513
You know what, Matthew,

03:16.514 --> 03:18.150
I'm starting to think maybe
Kirk Cameron is right.

03:18.151 --> 03:19.283
About what?

03:19.284 --> 03:20.385
About the fact that you're too gay.

03:20.386 --> 03:21.419
Okay.

03:21.420 --> 03:22.354
I'm sorry about the shift tomorrow.

03:22.355 --> 03:23.421
It's all right,

03:23.422 --> 03:25.088
I have to pick up my stupid niece anyway.

03:25.089 --> 03:26.656
I think I have an idea though.

03:26.657 --> 03:28.527
Who the fuck are you talking to, Billy?

03:32.431 --> 03:33.798
Ah, there you are.

03:33.799 --> 03:35.598
Would you object to my fucking

03:35.599 --> 03:36.401
some rich guys for money?

03:36.402 --> 03:37.635
Now hear me out.

03:37.636 --> 03:40.103
Not yucky prostitution
like in Leaving Las Vegas,

03:40.104 --> 03:42.207
adorable prostitution
like in Pretty Woman.

03:42.208 --> 03:45.342
Noodles, my parents are here, remember.

03:45.343 --> 03:49.013
Happy holidays, Julie!

03:49.014 --> 03:52.683
Ace, Bunny, is it Christmas already?

03:52.684 --> 03:54.651
Seems like you guys were just here.

03:54.652 --> 03:56.321
Sometimes I feel like
it's always Christmas

03:56.322 --> 03:58.622
and you're always here.

03:58.623 --> 04:01.426
Julie, we were just
saying you must join us

04:01.427 --> 04:03.994
on our next Connecticut vacation.

04:03.995 --> 04:05.163
That was last year.

04:05.164 --> 04:08.766
We caught a marlin off our schooner,

04:08.767 --> 04:11.368
with a badminton net.

04:11.369 --> 04:13.104
It's true.

04:13.105 --> 04:15.004
Rubberplant, my parents were just saying,

04:15.005 --> 04:16.773
that while they're here,
they're going to renew

04:16.774 --> 04:18.777
their wedding vows at the Elk Club.

04:18.778 --> 04:20.377
Oh, that's sweet.

04:20.378 --> 04:22.712
But isn't that a little
sentimental for you guys?

04:22.713 --> 04:25.115
Well, the vows are plain and factual.

04:25.116 --> 04:26.649
We don't wanna be rude.

04:26.650 --> 04:28.186
So how's your Hanukkah, Julie?

04:28.187 --> 04:29.220
What?

04:29.221 --> 04:30.988
Oh, Hanukkah, yes.

04:30.989 --> 04:31.656
Thank you for asking.

04:31.657 --> 04:32.456
It's okay.

04:32.457 --> 04:33.423
I have a show coming up,

04:33.424 --> 04:34.524
which I'm excited for,

04:34.525 --> 04:35.727
and I'm a little stressed out

04:35.728 --> 04:37.561
because I'm short on cash.

04:37.562 --> 04:40.998
We're trying--

04:40.999 --> 04:43.100
figure that out.

04:43.101 --> 04:43.700
What's wrong with your parents?

04:43.701 --> 04:44.968
Are they having seizures?

04:44.969 --> 04:46.338
You know that my parents can't tolerate

04:46.339 --> 04:48.539
any talk of money or feelings.

04:48.540 --> 04:51.775
But I have none of one and
so many of the other.

04:51.776 --> 04:53.276
Can you ask your mother?

04:53.277 --> 04:55.578
Yeah, if I want to be
emotionally blackmailed.

04:55.579 --> 04:57.480
Last week she took me grocery shopping,

04:57.481 --> 04:59.682
and now I have to pay it back to her

04:59.683 --> 05:02.152
by tagging along while she
buys herself more clothes.

05:02.153 --> 05:04.354
Yes, well, if your family had a motto

05:04.355 --> 05:06.456
for its coat of arms it
would be, "Quid pro quo".

05:06.457 --> 05:08.360
Yes, and the coat would
be from Loehmann's.

05:08.361 --> 05:09.560
- Julie.
- Yes.

05:09.561 --> 05:10.560
You wanna hear an embarrassing

05:10.561 --> 05:11.763
story about Arthur?

05:11.764 --> 05:13.998
Sure.

05:13.999 --> 05:17.501
One time he ordered a Malbec.

05:26.545 --> 05:28.278
So thanks again for the loan,

05:28.279 --> 05:29.481
and I'm sorry I had to ask for money

05:29.482 --> 05:31.048
two times in one month.

05:31.049 --> 05:32.448
It is a lot of money, Julie.

05:32.449 --> 05:33.785
Are you in some kind of trouble?

05:33.786 --> 05:35.452
No, I told you.

05:35.453 --> 05:37.189
Billy and I have a big
show at the Cutting Room,

05:37.190 --> 05:39.423
and we have to hire a full band.

05:39.424 --> 05:40.790
Musicians are not like comedians.

05:40.791 --> 05:41.726
You actually have to pay them.

05:41.727 --> 05:43.093
They have a skill.

05:43.094 --> 05:44.663
Can you bring this to the register please,

05:44.664 --> 05:46.730
in my size in every color.

05:46.731 --> 05:48.565
Do you have a dress for the show?

05:48.566 --> 05:50.068
Let me get this for you.

05:50.069 --> 05:53.137
Owning one pretty dress won't kill you.

05:53.138 --> 05:54.470
Why are you burning through money

05:54.471 --> 05:56.239
like it's a California forest?

05:56.240 --> 05:57.709
It's Christmas, Julie.

05:57.710 --> 05:59.476
It's suicide season,

05:59.477 --> 06:01.478
AKA ka-ching city.

06:01.479 --> 06:03.479
All right, I don't wanna be coarse,

06:03.480 --> 06:05.048
but it is that time of year

06:05.049 --> 06:06.216
when everybody gets down

06:06.217 --> 06:07.650
and then they wanna kill themselves.

06:07.651 --> 06:08.551
Well, could you blame them?

06:08.552 --> 06:09.652
Think of all the time

06:09.653 --> 06:11.089
they're spending with their families.

06:11.090 --> 06:13.257
So I'm inspired by Uber

06:13.258 --> 06:16.260
and I've begun peak surge pricing.

06:16.261 --> 06:18.195
Really?

06:18.196 --> 06:20.163
And you have no guilt about that?

06:20.164 --> 06:22.031
About being available for my patients

06:22.032 --> 06:23.268
when they need phone sessions?

06:23.269 --> 06:24.168
No.

06:24.169 --> 06:25.169
I'm helping.

06:25.170 --> 06:27.105
I'm just helping at a higher rate.

06:27.106 --> 06:28.405
Okay, I got to go.

06:28.406 --> 06:30.073
I have to go downtown and rehearse.

06:30.074 --> 06:33.176
We have barely spent any
time with one another.

06:33.177 --> 06:34.544
All right, how about tomorrow?

06:34.545 --> 06:36.512
Would you stop by the book club?

06:36.513 --> 06:38.281
With all due respect, I'm
not really interested

06:38.282 --> 06:40.585
in Phyllis Scopneck's take on Gone Girl.

06:40.586 --> 06:41.418
Fine.

06:41.419 --> 06:42.254
Then I guess I'll see you

06:42.255 --> 06:45.089
the next time you need money.

06:45.090 --> 06:46.757
Mom, that's not fair.

06:46.758 --> 06:49.259
Look, I'm sorry I'm not successful yet

06:49.260 --> 06:50.662
in my field of choice,

06:50.663 --> 06:53.030
but I appreciate your help.

06:53.031 --> 06:55.265
Not enough to spend time with me.

06:55.266 --> 06:56.701
I can't do this anymore.

07:00.038 --> 07:01.538
I'll get a job.

07:01.539 --> 07:03.374
Hello, Richard.

07:03.375 --> 07:05.241
This is a fine time for a phone session.

07:05.242 --> 07:08.079
It is 2.7 times higher than
my normal rate though.

07:08.080 --> 07:09.114
Is that okay?

07:15.620 --> 07:16.753
Uncle Billy, why are we here?

07:16.754 --> 07:18.154
This isn't Latin class.

07:18.155 --> 07:19.188
Tal, listen to me.

07:19.189 --> 07:20.258
Latin will not make you cooler.

07:20.259 --> 07:21.992
This is a better option.

07:21.993 --> 07:23.027
Look around.

07:23.028 --> 07:25.328
There are A-list gay dads everywhere.

07:25.329 --> 07:28.264
So, because you believe
there's a gay dad mafia,

07:28.265 --> 07:29.632
I have to pretend to be your daughter

07:29.633 --> 07:31.036
and take a dance class?

07:31.037 --> 07:32.403
Yes, for my career.

07:32.404 --> 07:34.570
If I skip Latin, I'd
have to lie to my dad.

07:34.571 --> 07:35.538
That's even cooler.

07:35.539 --> 07:36.406
Come on, let's go.

07:36.407 --> 07:37.475
I'm going to sign you up.

07:42.547 --> 07:44.248
I'll do this for you

07:44.249 --> 07:46.084
if you help me get a makeover.

07:46.085 --> 07:47.217
A makeover.

07:47.218 --> 07:48.618
Who taught you about gay men?

07:48.619 --> 07:50.488
We're not all invested in
making women look better.

07:50.489 --> 07:51.555
I don't care.

07:51.556 --> 07:53.390
I want spa services.

07:53.391 --> 07:55.058
My sister's always the one

07:55.059 --> 07:56.659
getting felt up at Bar Mitzvahs.

07:56.660 --> 07:58.628
I'm sick of being the smart one.

07:58.629 --> 08:00.029
Well, for what it's worth,

08:00.030 --> 08:01.433
we don't call you the smart one.

08:01.434 --> 08:02.433
Please.

08:02.434 --> 08:03.633
All right, fine, maybe after class

08:03.634 --> 08:04.736
we can start with an eyebrow wax

08:04.737 --> 08:06.170
as a point of entry.

08:06.171 --> 08:07.372
I'm going to call Julie.

08:09.107 --> 08:10.406
Hi, sorry to bother you,

08:10.407 --> 08:11.708
but my niece needs to get an eyebrow wax

08:11.709 --> 08:13.409
so that I can join the gay mafia.

08:13.410 --> 08:15.244
I could give you the name of my salon,

08:15.245 --> 08:17.649
but I don't think they
wax children's eyebrows.

08:20.051 --> 08:21.619
Listen, hey, I got to go.

08:21.620 --> 08:24.788
I've never said this
before, but I'm at work.

08:26.358 --> 08:28.658
Do these pants have any parabens in them?

08:28.659 --> 08:31.327
You know they're linking
those to autism now.

08:31.328 --> 08:33.698
Ooh, you don't look autistic to me.

08:33.698 --> 08:36.000
What face am I making?

08:36.001 --> 08:37.366
I don't have to tip you, right?

08:37.368 --> 08:38.534
I only have hundreds

08:38.534 --> 08:40.538
until my au pair gets
back from Balducci's.

08:40.539 --> 08:44.140
My roommate in college used
to do, not prostitution,

08:44.142 --> 08:46.476
but, like, she'd dress up and guys would,

08:46.477 --> 08:48.311
like, jerk off in front of her.

08:48.312 --> 08:50.146
Anyway, she'd find clients in Balducci's.

08:50.147 --> 08:51.180
Isn't that funny?

08:51.181 --> 08:52.281
Like, walking around the aisles.

08:52.282 --> 08:53.649
This is taking longer

08:53.650 --> 08:55.587
than getting a good table at Le Bernardin.

08:55.588 --> 08:57.421
Ah, good one.

08:57.422 --> 08:59.223
You like movies?

08:59.224 --> 09:01.090
You ever seen Capturing the Friedmans?

09:01.091 --> 09:02.458
Let me tell you about it.

09:02.459 --> 09:03.760
There's this guy in Great Neck,

09:03.761 --> 09:06.031
and he used to teach computer classes.

09:06.032 --> 09:08.999
Can you wrap while you're doing this?

09:09.000 --> 09:10.768
I guess so.

09:10.769 --> 09:12.302
There was this family.

09:12.303 --> 09:13.571
They were the Friedmans.

09:13.572 --> 09:17.408
Everybody wanted to go and meet them.

09:17.409 --> 09:19.743
Arnold taught a computer class.

09:19.744 --> 09:22.012
But everybody didn't know

09:22.013 --> 09:23.615
that he was a child molester.

09:23.616 --> 09:26.116
Julie, this is not working out.

09:26.117 --> 09:28.084
Come on, no, I really need this job.

09:28.085 --> 09:29.585
I need a gift wrap girl who doesn't need

09:29.586 --> 09:31.587
to summarize the plot of a documentary

09:31.588 --> 09:32.989
about a child molester.

09:32.990 --> 09:34.159
An alleged child molester,

09:34.160 --> 09:35.392
I told you that.

09:35.393 --> 09:36.628
Arnold definitely did it.

09:36.629 --> 09:39.663
But Jessie's probably not--

09:39.664 --> 09:41.065
Are you serious?

09:45.470 --> 09:46.769
I'm sorry, all of our dance classes

09:46.770 --> 09:49.207
are booked solid with a
three-year waiting list.

09:52.043 --> 09:54.446
It's just that things have
been really hard on us

09:54.447 --> 09:58.446
since my lover got deported to, um--

09:59.017 --> 10:00.551
to Boko Haram.

10:00.552 --> 10:01.484
I'm sorry, did you say

10:01.485 --> 10:03.721
you were looking for a dance class?

10:03.722 --> 10:06.356
Gail, can't we make room for--

10:06.357 --> 10:07.256
What's your name, dear?

10:07.257 --> 10:08.359
Oh, Billy Epstein.

10:08.360 --> 10:09.493
SAG-AFTRA.

10:09.494 --> 10:13.494
Tal, and I miss my dad's
lover Carlos so much.

10:14.165 --> 10:16.467
He wanted me to dance.

10:16.468 --> 10:19.303
If they're with you, Doug, she's in.

10:19.304 --> 10:20.537
They are.

10:20.538 --> 10:22.638
Welcome to Dancing Diva, kiddo.

10:22.639 --> 10:23.639
She's adorable.

10:23.640 --> 10:24.707
So, did you adopt?

10:24.708 --> 10:26.476
Oh, God no, I used a surrogate.

10:26.477 --> 10:27.610
Real skinny one too.

10:27.611 --> 10:29.212
I said, "Give me the
skinniest woman you have,

10:29.213 --> 10:30.480
I want to ruin her body."

10:30.481 --> 10:32.283
But Keira Knightley wanted
to have her own child,

10:32.284 --> 10:33.350
selfish bitch.

10:35.420 --> 10:37.386
Look, my daughter scam
is already paying off.

10:37.387 --> 10:39.055
First day in the class she meets a kid

10:39.056 --> 10:40.656
with a connection to Ryan Murphy,

10:40.657 --> 10:42.458
and get this, after American Horror Story,

10:42.459 --> 10:44.560
he's doing American Comedy Story.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.197
Of course that's his next move.

10:46.198 --> 10:47.698
God bless Ryan Murphy.

10:47.699 --> 10:49.434
Jessica Lange is playing Phyllis Diller.

10:49.435 --> 10:50.634
Thank God.

10:50.635 --> 10:52.235
And I'm gonna play Howie Mandel.

10:52.236 --> 10:54.370
My God, that sounds worse than Freak Show.

10:54.371 --> 10:55.638
You have to be on it.

10:55.639 --> 10:56.706
I'm going to have Tal put me on tape

10:56.707 --> 10:57.573
and she's going to give the tape

10:57.574 --> 10:58.641
to the casting director,

10:58.642 --> 11:00.245
who's going to give it to Ryan Murphy.

11:00.246 --> 11:01.311
How's your job?

11:01.312 --> 11:03.312
Well, today I learned how to make

11:03.313 --> 11:04.580
an origami swastika

11:04.581 --> 11:06.417
just to jazz up my gift wrap game.

11:06.418 --> 11:07.618
Oh that's nice.

11:07.619 --> 11:09.153
And then I was fired.

11:09.154 --> 11:09.753
What?

11:09.754 --> 11:11.154
How do you deal with your day job?

11:11.155 --> 11:12.788
I mean, you hate people as much as I do.

11:12.789 --> 11:15.324
I mean, you know, beats
working in an office.

11:15.325 --> 11:16.425
You're going to have to
eat shit no matter what.

11:16.426 --> 11:17.760
It's just about figuring out

11:17.761 --> 11:19.328
what type of shit you want to eat.

11:19.329 --> 11:20.730
But eating shit sucks.

11:20.731 --> 11:22.431
Only dogs like eating shit,

11:22.432 --> 11:24.734
and that's a bad example
because dogs are the best.

11:24.735 --> 11:26.636
I'm not saying that you have to live

11:26.637 --> 11:28.137
in an apartment as small as mine.

11:28.138 --> 11:29.438
I'm just saying that, you know,

11:29.439 --> 11:31.040
you can probably stand
to save a little money.

11:31.041 --> 11:32.441
Even the band has a second job.

11:32.442 --> 11:33.509
They sell Molly.

11:33.510 --> 11:35.180
By the way, Ted, you owe me some change.

11:41.252 --> 11:43.119
Oh hey, did you give
that girl my audition?

11:43.120 --> 11:44.220
I didn't sit through eight takes

11:44.221 --> 11:45.621
of you trying to blow up a surgical glove

11:45.622 --> 11:47.023
with your nose for nothing.

11:47.024 --> 11:48.193
Excuse me, that was hilarious.

11:48.194 --> 11:49.326
It was worth it.

11:49.327 --> 11:50.627
Okay, good news.

11:50.628 --> 11:51.694
Jaden Patrick Harris had

11:51.695 --> 11:53.596
some bad edamame this afternoon,

11:53.597 --> 11:55.164
and now she can't stop puking.

11:55.165 --> 11:56.634
Oh, that is good news.

11:56.635 --> 11:59.169
No, the good part is I get to fill in

11:59.170 --> 12:00.772
as the lead role in
tomorrow night's recital.

12:00.773 --> 12:02.673
Wow, that's amazing.

12:02.674 --> 12:03.741
I'm sorry, I wish I could come.

12:03.742 --> 12:06.743
I have my Cutting Room show with Julie.

12:06.744 --> 12:09.479
If you can't take me, then I can't go.

12:09.480 --> 12:10.746
I have to have an adult sign me in,

12:10.747 --> 12:12.582
and my dad doesn't know
anything about this.

12:12.583 --> 12:14.016
I don't know what to tell you, Tal.

12:14.017 --> 12:15.551
I have a show with Julie, you know.

12:15.552 --> 12:16.387
It's important.

12:16.388 --> 12:17.555
It's my career.

12:20.358 --> 12:22.092
What are you doing?

12:22.093 --> 12:23.459
Excuse me, are you crying?

12:23.460 --> 12:24.527
Please don't cry here.

12:24.528 --> 12:25.561
What if someone sees you?

12:25.562 --> 12:27.432
You're going to embarrass me.

12:27.433 --> 12:29.733
Tal, stop making this about you.

12:29.734 --> 12:31.502
I hope you can live with yourself.

12:31.503 --> 12:34.171
Excuse me, I love living with myself.

12:34.172 --> 12:35.238
I'm a very good roommate.

12:35.239 --> 12:36.472
I refuse to feel bad about this.

12:36.473 --> 12:37.773
This is my career, Tal.

12:37.774 --> 12:39.308
Stop crying or those eyelash extensions

12:39.309 --> 12:40.411
I bought you are gonna fall off--

12:40.412 --> 12:41.478
Oh, my phone!

12:41.479 --> 12:42.347
I can't believe they're letting

12:42.348 --> 12:44.014
Tal dance Jaden's part.

12:44.015 --> 12:45.315
She's so weird.

12:45.316 --> 12:47.252
She probably won't even show up anyway.

12:47.253 --> 12:48.518
God, I hope not.

12:53.391 --> 12:54.626
Ice rat, we're home.

12:54.627 --> 12:56.260
Don't mess up my piles.

12:56.261 --> 12:57.026
What are you doing?

12:57.027 --> 12:58.094
Since I lost my job,

12:58.095 --> 12:59.662
I'm downsizing some creature comforts

12:59.663 --> 13:01.230
based on Billy's suggestion.

13:01.231 --> 13:03.065
So, I'm selling some of my stuff on eBay.

13:03.066 --> 13:04.467
But this is my stuff.

13:04.468 --> 13:06.502
Actually, that sweater
on top, that's mine.

13:06.503 --> 13:07.705
Oh, Reginald, don't be rude.

13:07.706 --> 13:08.772
Who's Reginald?

13:08.773 --> 13:10.206
I thought you were Ace.

13:10.207 --> 13:11.641
Yes, well, my father goes by Ace,

13:11.642 --> 13:12.777
but he was born Reginald.

13:12.778 --> 13:14.411
To his father, Talbot,

13:14.412 --> 13:17.681
whose first name is Cappy,
but Trip for short.

13:17.682 --> 13:19.249
Wasps.

13:19.250 --> 13:20.716
Where are you guys coming from?

13:20.717 --> 13:22.520
We had a run-through of our ceremony.

13:22.521 --> 13:26.056
- Read her the vows.
- Let's see.

13:26.057 --> 13:30.093
"Bunny, you have been
my wife for 40 years.

13:30.094 --> 13:34.197
Today we are renewing our
vows at the Yale Club.

13:34.198 --> 13:37.634
We are married again, still."

13:37.635 --> 13:39.469
Great job, Dad.

13:39.470 --> 13:41.038
I'm moved.

13:41.039 --> 13:42.340
40 years.

13:50.782 --> 13:53.083
Another, yeah.

13:56.054 --> 13:58.388
More eggs.

13:58.389 --> 13:59.456
And gin.

13:59.457 --> 14:00.625
Sure thing, Santa.

14:04.295 --> 14:06.431
Something wrong, ten words or less.

14:06.432 --> 14:08.298
No.

14:08.299 --> 14:10.334
- Well...
- Oh, shit.

14:10.335 --> 14:12.001
I have a 12-year-old niece

14:12.002 --> 14:13.436
that I take to this dance class.

14:13.437 --> 14:15.538
And she got the lead in her recital.

14:15.539 --> 14:17.006
But the recital is the same night

14:17.007 --> 14:18.307
as my show with Julie.

14:18.308 --> 14:19.542
So now she can't do the recital

14:19.543 --> 14:21.110
because I have to do my show.

14:21.111 --> 14:22.978
All of a sudden there were tears,

14:22.979 --> 14:24.146
and there's crying.

14:24.147 --> 14:25.648
I don't need this shit.

14:25.649 --> 14:28.086
I didn't even know you had a family.

14:28.087 --> 14:30.053
Now I feel sad.

14:30.054 --> 14:31.687
Yeah, that's guilt, stupid.

14:31.688 --> 14:32.722
Is it too late to fix it,

14:32.723 --> 14:33.723
or are you going to screw it up

14:33.724 --> 14:35.324
the way you screw everything else up.

14:35.325 --> 14:37.326
I could change my plans,
but what about my show?

14:37.327 --> 14:38.494
What about your show?

14:38.495 --> 14:39.562
You know, the only person

14:39.563 --> 14:41.364
I ever see you with is that ginger witch.

14:41.365 --> 14:44.166
You see me every day and
I don't even like you.

14:44.167 --> 14:46.135
If you don't fix things with your niece,

14:46.136 --> 14:49.006
you're going to end up
alone like that guy.

14:49.007 --> 14:50.440
In like, three weeks.

14:50.441 --> 14:54.344
♪ Mama's little baby call Santa, Santa ♪

14:54.345 --> 14:57.682
♪ Mama's little Santa
like eggs and gin ♪
♪

15:03.421 --> 15:04.555
Hey, I have some big news.

15:04.556 --> 15:05.489
Me too.

15:05.490 --> 15:06.522
I'm still broke.

15:06.523 --> 15:08.057
I can't hold a day job.

15:08.058 --> 15:09.425
I can't keep taking money from my mother

15:09.426 --> 15:11.327
because I'm sick of being told what to do.

15:11.328 --> 15:12.463
The only thing keeping me

15:12.464 --> 15:15.699
from completely losing
my shit is this show.

15:15.700 --> 15:16.766
Okay, your turn.

15:16.767 --> 15:18.102
I can't do the show tonight.

15:21.172 --> 15:24.373
You're telling me that you
can't do our show tonight?

15:24.374 --> 15:25.775
The one that's in six hours?

15:25.776 --> 15:28.577
The one that I wrapped
presents to pay for?

15:28.578 --> 15:30.146
I know, please don't jump off a bridge.

15:30.147 --> 15:31.382
Boy, it really is suicide season.

15:31.383 --> 15:32.215
A bridge?

15:32.216 --> 15:33.582
Honestly, I'd probably use pills.

15:33.583 --> 15:35.052
Really, I always thought
a belt and a chair

15:35.053 --> 15:36.286
was the way to go.

15:36.287 --> 15:37.653
Yeah, but then they'd say
you were jerking off.

15:37.654 --> 15:38.556
Yeah, but then they could say,

15:38.557 --> 15:40.223
"He died as he lived."

15:40.224 --> 15:41.590
Billy, the show is a big deal.

15:41.591 --> 15:43.225
Why are you doing this to me?

15:43.226 --> 15:45.094
You know, I made Tal
take that dance class,

15:45.095 --> 15:46.497
and now I have to go to her recital.

15:46.498 --> 15:47.631
You know Tal.

15:47.632 --> 15:49.232
She's us at that age.

15:49.233 --> 15:50.299
She has a lifetime of cyber bullying

15:50.300 --> 15:52.270
and Saturday nights alone ahead of her.

15:52.271 --> 15:55.739
This might be her one big night.

15:55.740 --> 15:57.107
Fine.

15:57.108 --> 15:58.507
We'll cancel the show.

15:58.508 --> 16:00.042
I don't have anything
to wear to it anyway.

16:00.043 --> 16:02.077
I sold most of my clothes on Craigslist.

16:02.078 --> 16:03.078
You're using Craigslist

16:03.079 --> 16:04.649
for something other than anonymous sex?

16:04.650 --> 16:05.615
I know.

16:05.616 --> 16:06.517
This time of year really shows

16:06.518 --> 16:08.218
you how low you can sink.

16:16.060 --> 16:17.460
I thought The Good Wife
was better than this.

16:17.461 --> 16:20.198
Say what you will about
equity partner Alicia Florek.

16:20.199 --> 16:22.132
She's an awfully good wife.

16:22.133 --> 16:23.534
You can say that again.

16:23.535 --> 16:27.704
That Peter Florek, though,
he's a bad husband.

16:27.705 --> 16:28.738
Mom?

16:28.739 --> 16:29.972
Don't worry, I took a Claritin

16:29.973 --> 16:31.173
because of the dogs.

16:31.174 --> 16:33.377
I have a taxi waiting because
of the neighborhood.

16:33.378 --> 16:35.445
Look.

16:35.446 --> 16:36.779
I bought you that dress.

16:36.780 --> 16:39.081
Oh, no, no, no, I can't accept that.

16:39.082 --> 16:40.583
Stop it, I don't want anything in return.

16:40.584 --> 16:42.620
I just want you to look
pretty for your show.

16:42.621 --> 16:44.154
Oh, thank you, Mom.

16:44.155 --> 16:45.788
That's very sweet, but it doesn't matter

16:45.789 --> 16:47.623
because there is no show anymore.

16:47.624 --> 16:48.693
Billy backed out.

16:48.694 --> 16:50.227
Oh no, is he okay?

16:50.228 --> 16:52.496
He must feel terrible.

16:52.497 --> 16:53.797
Is that a loofah?

16:53.798 --> 16:55.264
You should not exfoliate.

16:55.265 --> 16:57.066
You know you have irritable skin.

16:57.067 --> 16:58.736
No, Mom, it's not skincare.

16:58.737 --> 17:00.003
It's dinner.

17:00.004 --> 17:01.506
I'm trying to save money.

17:01.507 --> 17:03.440
Oh, Julie.

17:03.441 --> 17:04.976
You know that I think that Arthur

17:04.977 --> 17:06.609
is a perfectly sweet man

17:06.611 --> 17:09.045
for a functioning alcoholic.

17:09.046 --> 17:11.046
But have you ever considered
marrying somebody

17:11.047 --> 17:12.748
that doesn't work for Public Television,

17:12.749 --> 17:15.384
then all your money worries would be over.

17:15.385 --> 17:17.752
No, mom, if I marry a rich husband,

17:17.753 --> 17:19.188
he's just going to expect the same things

17:19.189 --> 17:20.422
that you do from me.

17:20.423 --> 17:21.692
I just also have to sleep with him.

17:21.693 --> 17:23.593
What do I expect of you?

17:23.594 --> 17:25.094
Listen, as long as I continue

17:25.095 --> 17:26.428
to take money from you,

17:26.429 --> 17:28.196
I have to let you tell me what to do,

17:28.198 --> 17:29.765
and give me passive aggressive advice

17:29.766 --> 17:31.100
about who I should be.

17:31.101 --> 17:32.268
And I'm sick of it.

17:32.269 --> 17:33.435
I'm not doing it anymore.

17:33.436 --> 17:34.737
I have news for you, Julie.

17:34.738 --> 17:37.006
Even if you didn't take a cent from me,

17:37.007 --> 17:38.476
I'm still going to give you advice,

17:38.477 --> 17:40.377
because that's who I am,

17:40.378 --> 17:42.679
and that's what I do,

17:42.680 --> 17:44.981
because I'm your mother.

17:44.982 --> 17:48.652
So, I can't escape the
shackles of our dynamic

17:48.653 --> 17:50.486
even if I do pay my own way.

17:50.487 --> 17:53.122
Well, I wouldn't say--
is that The Good Wife?

17:53.123 --> 17:55.026
Wait a minute, I think I'm onto something.

17:55.027 --> 17:57.494
I've painted myself into a corner.

17:57.495 --> 17:59.396
If I can't marry rich,

17:59.397 --> 18:01.797
take your money, or tolerate a day job,

18:01.798 --> 18:04.633
I have no choice but to
earn a living in comedy.

18:04.634 --> 18:07.503
How can you see that
screen with all that dust?

18:07.504 --> 18:09.240
You know what, I'm going
to do that show tonight

18:09.241 --> 18:11.041
with or without Billy.

18:11.042 --> 18:14.711
Julie, that's you on television.

18:14.712 --> 18:17.247
Oh my God.

18:17.248 --> 18:19.983
It's a sign.

18:29.327 --> 18:31.028
Get in the cab, I'm saving Christmas.

18:33.097 --> 18:34.265
What happened to your show with Julie?

18:34.266 --> 18:35.465
I'm not doing it.

18:35.466 --> 18:37.566
I don't want to end up some
drunk Santa at a Santa Con

18:37.567 --> 18:39.337
singing his own lyrics
to Shortening Bread.

18:39.338 --> 18:41.104
Let's go.

18:41.105 --> 18:43.038
Hey, Dad, there's been a Latin emergency,

18:43.039 --> 18:45.042
and Uncle Billy's taking us to the city.

18:45.043 --> 18:46.376
Bye!

18:46.377 --> 18:48.010
Come on, and you better
be good at this recital.

18:48.011 --> 18:49.011
If you miss any steps,

18:49.012 --> 18:50.212
I'm telling everyone
you're not my daughter.

18:50.213 --> 18:52.383
I don't want any stupid Abigail Breslin,

18:52.384 --> 18:56.019
Little Miss Sunshine bullshit.

18:56.020 --> 18:57.555
You used the word "trapped",

18:57.556 --> 19:00.624
could you speak about that some more?

19:00.625 --> 19:02.225
I'm here.

19:02.226 --> 19:03.660
Yes.

19:03.661 --> 19:06.564
Oh I've been listening
to everything you said.

19:06.565 --> 19:08.632
I just think the repetition

19:08.633 --> 19:10.132
would be beneficial for you.

19:10.133 --> 19:12.267
Ma'am, we're at The Cutting Room.

19:12.268 --> 19:13.535
My daughter's show doesn't start

19:13.536 --> 19:15.137
for another ten minutes.

19:15.138 --> 19:16.374
Go around the block another time.

19:16.375 --> 19:20.377
I'm saving lives and making money.

19:20.378 --> 19:21.711
Hello.

19:21.712 --> 19:24.547
Well, your father sounds like a monster.

19:24.548 --> 19:26.049
I mean your mother.

19:26.050 --> 19:27.383
Thanks for coming out tonight, guys.

19:27.384 --> 19:29.418
This last thing was going to be a duet,

20:58.174 --> 20:59.641
Oh, my mom never even came to the show.

20:59.642 --> 21:00.776
She was surge pricing her patients

21:00.777 --> 21:02.747
in an Uber that was surge pricing her.

21:02.748 --> 21:04.380
Sounds about right.

21:04.381 --> 21:06.448
I can't believe I've never
been to your apartment before.

21:06.449 --> 21:09.353
Well, it's not exactly set
up for entertaining guests.

21:09.354 --> 21:13.556
It's not exactly set up for standing.

21:13.557 --> 21:15.257
I know you're in your mid 30s,

21:15.258 --> 21:17.493
but I just want to say I'm
sorry your mom cut you off.

21:17.494 --> 21:19.728
Thank you, but I'm not going
to make a whole thing

21:19.729 --> 21:22.199
whining about it like some
privileged white girl

21:22.200 --> 21:24.067
writing from experience.

21:24.068 --> 21:25.467
I'm sorry I missed our show.

21:25.468 --> 21:27.069
It's okay, you had to be there for Tal.

21:27.070 --> 21:28.103
I always thought that if I showed up

21:28.104 --> 21:30.205
for a family member when
I said I was going to,

21:30.206 --> 21:31.306
that's the best way to keep them

21:31.307 --> 21:32.708
out of the entertainment industry.

21:32.709 --> 21:34.743
There's no kinder gesture than that.

21:34.744 --> 21:37.379
And I guess I see myself
in her in some weird way.

21:37.380 --> 21:40.215
I was even more awkward than
she was when I was that age.

21:40.216 --> 21:41.352
I guess I thought if I showed up for her,

21:41.353 --> 21:43.319
she might actually be okay.

21:43.320 --> 21:44.653
Please don't tell me that this Christmas

21:44.654 --> 21:46.690
ends with your heart growing three sizes.

21:46.691 --> 21:47.757
Fuck that.

21:47.758 --> 21:49.291
That bitch stole my part.

21:49.292 --> 21:50.394
- What?
- Did I not tell you this?

21:50.395 --> 21:51.327
No!

21:51.328 --> 21:53.697
She submitted herself to Ryan Murphy,

21:53.698 --> 21:55.465
not my tape, herself.

21:55.466 --> 21:58.569
And she got cast as one of
Paula Poundstone's kids.

21:58.570 --> 22:00.537
Holy shit.

22:00.538 --> 22:02.105
That's a good part.

22:02.106 --> 22:04.175
I showed up for her when
I said I was going to,

22:04.176 --> 22:06.276
and she's still one of us.

22:06.277 --> 22:08.444
God, I love show business.

22:08.445 --> 22:10.045
You know, I have a feeling

22:10.046 --> 22:11.582
that this year's going
to be easier for us.

22:11.583 --> 22:13.082
Yeah?

22:13.083 --> 22:15.352
I wonder what we're going
to complain about.

22:15.353 --> 22:16.519
I have no idea.

22:16.520 --> 22:18.354
It's so exciting.

22:18.355 --> 22:19.490
Merry Christmas, Jules.

22:19.491 --> 22:21.424
Merry Christmas, Billy.

22:21.425 --> 22:23.293
Hey!

22:23.294 --> 22:24.393
I broke in last night

22:24.394 --> 22:25.629
and slept in your bathtub.

22:25.630 --> 22:27.463
What the fuck?

22:27.464 --> 22:29.566
Happy Hanukkah.
