1:13:30.623 --> 1:13:34.192
I wanted to thank you
for what you did for me.

1:13:34.235 --> 1:13:37.108
-What did I do?
-Well...

1:13:37.237 --> 1:13:41.068
-You know, my tuition.
-Tuition? What tuition?

1:13:41.504 --> 1:13:44.157
You covered my semester's
tuition at the university.

1:13:44.245 --> 1:13:47.987
They called me from the office,
Jim. They said you covered it.

1:13:50.643 --> 1:13:52.558
Well...

1:13:52.689 --> 1:13:55.996
-Somebody made a mistake.
-Why?

1:13:56.083 --> 1:13:58.912
Why do you do that?

1:13:58.956 --> 1:14:04.264
I mean, I am so thankful
for what you did for me.

1:14:07.355 --> 1:14:10.271
But why did you help me?

1:14:10.315 --> 1:14:13.187
Why do you help everybody?

1:14:13.318 --> 1:14:16.930
You know, everybody tells
stories about you

1:14:17.061 --> 1:14:19.933
helping them out
with something,

1:14:19.977 --> 1:14:23.894
paying for something
without them asking or...

1:14:23.937 --> 1:14:28.550
just giving, giving without
being even asked for it.

1:14:28.594 --> 1:14:31.902
Why did you help me?
Why do you help everybody?

1:14:31.945 --> 1:14:34.644
I should help.

1:14:34.773 --> 1:14:36.341
I need to help.
It's an obligation.

1:14:36.472 --> 1:14:39.083
-But why?
-Because I can.

1:14:40.737 --> 1:14:43.870
And because
I got nothing else to do.

1:14:44.001 --> 1:14:46.699
And probably because
you have no one else to help.

1:14:48.919 --> 1:14:50.050
I'm sorry.

1:14:52.662 --> 1:14:57.188
Can I ask you something?
Who was the guy from yesterday?

1:14:57.318 --> 1:15:00.147
You've been acting weird
ever since.

1:15:00.191 --> 1:15:03.716
Stop. Just a kid
looking for a job.

1:15:03.803 --> 1:15:05.588
And you didn't help him?

1:15:07.067 --> 1:15:08.678
It's complicated.

1:15:12.638 --> 1:15:14.727
He brought back memories
that, uh...

1:15:14.771 --> 1:15:17.948
Bad memories?

1:15:17.991 --> 1:15:19.602
No.

1:15:21.995 --> 1:15:24.258
Matter of fact, they were...

1:15:24.302 --> 1:15:26.304
[sighs]

1:15:28.175 --> 1:15:30.700
They were good memories.

1:15:30.743 --> 1:15:33.790
Probably the best memories
I've ever had,

1:15:33.920 --> 1:15:36.270
and that's why
I reacted the way I did.

1:15:36.314 --> 1:15:40.187
Yeah. I had lost something,
and I didn't notice it, and...

1:15:43.059 --> 1:15:46.585
I'm trying to bury the past,
and he just brought it back.

1:15:51.068 --> 1:15:52.416
That's... buried now.

1:15:52.504 --> 1:15:54.505
And you don't want
to see those memories

1:15:54.550 --> 1:15:58.554
-you enjoyed so much, again?
-No.

1:15:58.597 --> 1:16:00.164
No.

1:16:00.294 --> 1:16:01.513
Why?

1:16:01.557 --> 1:16:03.862
It's too late.

1:16:05.996 --> 1:16:08.215
No, Jim.

1:16:08.259 --> 1:16:11.218
It's never too late. Trust me.

1:16:11.262 --> 1:16:13.830
As long as we're here,

1:16:13.873 --> 1:16:17.268
it's never too late to reconnect
with your happiest memories.

1:16:17.398 --> 1:16:20.663
It's okay to make yourself
happy, too,

1:16:20.706 --> 1:16:24.231
to give to yourself
the way you give to others.

1:16:35.025 --> 1:16:39.769
[solemn piano music playing]

1:17:32.125 --> 1:17:34.737
Why didn't you call me before?

1:17:34.867 --> 1:17:36.695
I didn't want to bother.

1:17:36.826 --> 1:17:38.697
You don't bother me.

1:17:39.871 --> 1:17:41.439
Thanks for the food.

1:17:41.482 --> 1:17:43.049
Seriously?

1:17:45.050 --> 1:17:46.226
[speaking Spanish]

1:17:47.837 --> 1:17:48.880
-[coughs]
-Can I take your plate?

1:17:48.925 --> 1:17:51.449
Yes. Yes.

1:17:51.492 --> 1:17:53.886
[exhales deeply]

1:17:55.366 --> 1:17:56.759
[exhales deeply]

1:17:56.802 --> 1:17:59.718
I want to talk to you
about, you know, us.

1:17:59.849 --> 1:18:01.546
Nico, don't.

1:18:03.416 --> 1:18:05.202
Just forget everything.

1:18:07.334 --> 1:18:09.859
You can't do anything
to bring him back, right?

1:18:11.556 --> 1:18:13.340
You can do
something for yourself

1:18:13.384 --> 1:18:15.907
and make him feel proud of you.

1:18:19.956 --> 1:18:24.047
After that night with you
in Cuba, I felt guilty.

1:18:26.614 --> 1:18:33.099
But then I thought about him,
and I remember how he was.

1:18:33.143 --> 1:18:36.233
And I know that if he would
have been watching us

1:18:36.362 --> 1:18:39.323
from some faraway place,

1:18:39.366 --> 1:18:42.543
he would have felt happy
that I was with you.

1:18:50.377 --> 1:18:52.815
-Let me take you home.
-No. No. [clears throat]

1:18:54.120 --> 1:18:56.732
Nico. Look at me.

1:18:56.818 --> 1:18:59.255
You're homeless.

1:18:59.386 --> 1:19:02.650
You gotta take a shower.
You gotta eat.

1:19:02.781 --> 1:19:04.348
You gotta sleep in a warm place.

1:19:04.391 --> 1:19:07.568
You have to move on.

1:19:07.612 --> 1:19:10.528
-You have to change, Nico.
-I gotta finish first.

1:19:12.965 --> 1:19:15.620
Then I'll change.

1:19:15.663 --> 1:19:17.709
[jazz music playing]

1:19:46.607 --> 1:19:49.219
-Twenty five.
-Twenty five? That's bad.

1:19:49.262 --> 1:19:52.004
-How about white?
-Uh, 30.

1:19:52.048 --> 1:19:54.615
Thirty? Cases of beer?

1:19:54.659 --> 1:19:56.748
Fifteen, but I think
we started out with 20.

1:19:56.879 --> 1:19:59.359
-Then Mikey was telling me--
-Shh. Hold on a second.

1:20:02.014 --> 1:20:03.799
[distant singing]

1:20:03.842 --> 1:20:05.800
[Nico signing in Spanish]

1:20:20.728 --> 1:20:23.906
Keep counting.
Give me a total, okay?

1:20:24.123 --> 1:20:25.255
You got it.

1:20:27.910 --> 1:20:31.565
[Nico continues singing
in the distance]

1:20:33.437 --> 1:20:36.179
[continues singing in Spanish]

1:20:44.230 --> 1:20:45.710
-Thanks, shithead.
-Hey! Hey!

1:20:45.797 --> 1:20:47.973
-You don't listen, do you?
-Just gimme that!

1:20:48.103 --> 1:20:50.628
What's with you
and this stupid rag anyway?

1:20:50.715 --> 1:20:51.889
Hey, that's him!

1:20:52.021 --> 1:20:53.718
Crazy motherfucker,
who two days ago

1:20:53.761 --> 1:20:57.026
assaulted me
after he invaded my park!

1:20:57.330 --> 1:20:59.115
-What'd you do to my lady?
-I didn't do anything to her.

1:20:59.245 --> 1:21:00.638
-Hold it.
-No, no, no.

1:21:00.681 --> 1:21:02.814
Hey! Shut up.

1:21:02.945 --> 1:21:05.469
-You don't belong here.
-He's a monster, a number 12.

1:21:05.512 --> 1:21:06.905
You have to pay the price

1:21:06.949 --> 1:21:08.776
if you don't respect
our community.

1:21:08.907 --> 1:21:10.474
We have rules to follow here.

1:21:10.517 --> 1:21:13.303
-Can't just invade our space.
-I'm not invading your space.

1:21:13.346 --> 1:21:14.870
We gave you
a few chances already.

1:21:14.957 --> 1:21:17.002
You just ignored us,
blew us off.

1:21:17.133 --> 1:21:19.135
-I wonder what this crazy--
-No!

1:21:19.178 --> 1:21:22.486
-[Nico protesting]
-[group arguing]

1:21:22.616 --> 1:21:24.096
Hey! Hey.

1:21:25.532 --> 1:21:27.883
-Stop that now!
-Who the fuck are you?

1:21:29.754 --> 1:21:32.670
-Hey, Jim.
-Charles, don't do that.

1:21:33.889 --> 1:21:35.978
Hey, Jim. He--

1:21:36.065 --> 1:21:37.936
We're just teaching
this guy a lesson. He--

1:21:37.980 --> 1:21:39.677
He doesn't follow the rules.

1:21:39.764 --> 1:21:42.853
Rules?

1:21:42.985 --> 1:21:44.073
What the hell you talking about,
Prince?

1:21:44.116 --> 1:21:49.165
Um, our rules. He's an intruder.

1:21:49.295 --> 1:21:52.081
-He is enemy.
-No, he's not.

1:21:54.300 --> 1:21:55.693
He's my son.

1:21:58.174 --> 1:21:59.218
Your son?

1:22:00.654 --> 1:22:02.004
I didn't know you had a son.

1:22:02.134 --> 1:22:04.005
But he doesn't look
anything like you.

1:22:04.136 --> 1:22:08.053
-Do you resemble your mama?
-Hey! Hey!

1:22:08.184 --> 1:22:09.663
Take it easy, Jim.
We were trying--

1:22:09.794 --> 1:22:12.144
No, I'm not gonna
take it easy, Prince.

1:22:12.231 --> 1:22:15.800
I feed you guys
and make everything possible

1:22:15.843 --> 1:22:17.454
so you have a place to stay.

1:22:17.584 --> 1:22:19.673
I give you money,
I give you clothes,

1:22:19.804 --> 1:22:22.371
and this is the way
you treat my family?

1:22:22.415 --> 1:22:26.028
So no,
I'm not gonna take it easy.

1:22:29.031 --> 1:22:30.728
Give it to me.

1:22:47.701 --> 1:22:51.487
I-- I'm sorry, Jim.
We-- We-- We're sorry.

1:22:52.924 --> 1:22:53.969
Yeah.

1:22:55.405 --> 1:22:57.710
Just don't let it happen again.

1:22:57.842 --> 1:23:00.410
It won't. It won't happen again.

1:23:00.452 --> 1:23:02.281
Here.

1:23:02.412 --> 1:23:04.153
Let's go. Everybody, let's go.

1:23:14.032 --> 1:23:15.032
Thank you.

1:23:19.820 --> 1:23:22.780
You need a shower. You stink.

1:23:25.043 --> 1:23:26.914
I'm sorry.

1:23:27.045 --> 1:23:28.960
Don't be sorry. It's okay.

1:23:30.092 --> 1:23:31.397
Yeah.

1:23:31.441 --> 1:23:33.965
Come on. Come with me.

1:23:36.576 --> 1:23:38.361
Come on. Let's go.

1:23:40.450 --> 1:23:41.973
[soft music playing]

1:24:16.877 --> 1:24:18.835
-I see my clothes fit you.
-Yeah.

1:24:21.708 --> 1:24:23.232
Sit down. Dinner's ready.

1:24:26.931 --> 1:24:28.019
Okay?

1:24:33.503 --> 1:24:36.462
When was the last time
you had a decent hot meal?

1:24:37.594 --> 1:24:38.638
I don't remember.

1:24:43.034 --> 1:24:46.168
Look, I wanna thank you
for everything.

1:24:46.516 --> 1:24:47.603
That song...

1:24:49.040 --> 1:24:50.868
the one you were singing
in the park...

1:24:53.262 --> 1:24:54.523
where'd you learn that?

1:24:56.787 --> 1:24:58.919
He told me it was
his mom's favorite song.

1:25:00.704 --> 1:25:05.621
He said that she used to sing
that song for him every night

1:25:05.752 --> 1:25:07.145
to make him go to sleep.

1:25:20.332 --> 1:25:22.029
When did you guys meet?

1:25:22.160 --> 1:25:25.816
About six years ago
when I moved to Cuba.

1:25:25.859 --> 1:25:29.472
I wanted to learn all about
my roots and my background,

1:25:30.299 --> 1:25:31.169
plus my father.

1:25:32.952 --> 1:25:36.000
My father wanted me
to learn Rumba Cubana,

1:25:36.087 --> 1:25:37.654
but I knew I'm not gonna
get that here.

1:25:37.784 --> 1:25:39.568
Where's your father now?

1:25:39.612 --> 1:25:42.093
He's also in heaven.

1:25:43.573 --> 1:25:44.748
I'm sorry.

1:25:50.536 --> 1:25:52.321
Go ahead. Eat now.

1:25:57.239 --> 1:26:00.459
You guys
have the same personality.

1:26:00.590 --> 1:26:01.808
I mean, you and my dad.

1:26:04.550 --> 1:26:06.161
When I saw you the other day...

1:26:08.250 --> 1:26:10.382
...it was just like
looking at him.

1:26:11.818 --> 1:26:13.603
Eat. It's getting cold.

1:26:20.044 --> 1:26:21.959
-Do you have a place to stay?
-Not really.

1:26:22.655 --> 1:26:24.875
[sniffles]

1:26:25.005 --> 1:26:26.833
I mean, I know somebody.

1:26:26.877 --> 1:26:30.141
Hmm. But it's complicated.

1:26:31.838 --> 1:26:33.840
-A girl.
-Yeah.

1:26:33.884 --> 1:26:37.975
With them,
it's always complicated.

1:26:40.717 --> 1:26:42.762
Do you love her?

1:26:45.200 --> 1:26:46.549
[clears throat]

1:26:48.420 --> 1:26:49.856
It's very complicated.

1:26:52.468 --> 1:26:54.383
I understand.

1:26:54.425 --> 1:26:58.213
[siren blaring in distance]

...you go and get her.

Don't be a pussy.

1:27:10.094 --> 1:27:11.791
You can't change the past...

1:27:13.619 --> 1:27:15.665
...but you can change
the present and the future.

1:27:19.190 --> 1:27:21.192
Don't make
the same mistake I made.

1:27:21.279 --> 1:27:22.454
You...

1:27:24.064 --> 1:27:25.718
You got out and get her.

1:27:26.850 --> 1:27:29.418
In the meantime you can
stay here. You can crash here.

1:27:31.028 --> 1:27:32.334
You sure?

1:27:32.464 --> 1:27:35.075
-Of course.
-What about him?

1:27:36.120 --> 1:27:37.904
He's gonna be okay now.

1:27:40.690 --> 1:27:42.169
Besides, he's probably tired

1:27:42.300 --> 1:27:43.867
of you getting him
lost in the city.

You know,
I always imagined this moment.

I always knew...

1:28:37.312 --> 1:28:38.530
that one day...

1:28:42.186 --> 1:28:45.842
I would have a shot
of rum with my son...

1:28:48.800 --> 1:28:50.150
...and talk about life.

1:28:57.070 --> 1:28:58.681
I never thought
it would be like this.

[glasses clinking]

1:29:12.085 --> 1:29:13.130
I--

1:29:14.740 --> 1:29:17.352
I've been waiting
for this moment for a long time.

1:29:27.579 --> 1:29:28.928
I've even imagined

1:29:30.974 --> 1:29:33.585
every single piece
of you in my head.

...your eyes...

...your hair...
