[roaring]

00:32.771 --> 00:35.426
[man on radio]: SkyMed 911,
this is Dispatch.

00:35.470 --> 00:37.559
Got a hunter at a fly-in camp
with an airstrip.

00:37.602 --> 00:40.040
Probably just needs
steri-strips. Are you able?

00:40.083 --> 00:42.390
- You got coordinates
for the airstrip?

00:44.131 --> 00:46.481
- That's not a runway,
it's a goddamn quarry.

00:46.524 --> 00:49.658
- Nice and crunchy, too.
Precautionary approach?

00:49.701 --> 00:51.964
- Got to.
Runway condition?

00:52.008 --> 00:54.880
- Gravel looks firm.
Can't see any obstacles.

00:54.924 --> 00:56.708
- Hold onto your butts.

00:58.406 --> 01:00.843
- Come on.
Dispatch said he had a camp.

01:01.713 --> 01:04.194
Elroy, I'm your flight nurse,
Crystal. This is Chopper.

01:04.238 --> 01:06.979
Can I have a look?
[man grunting]

01:07.893 --> 01:10.200
- Okay, that's gonna need a lot
more than steri-strips.

01:10.244 --> 01:12.376
- You've lost a lot of blood,
Elroy.

01:12.420 --> 01:14.987
I'm gonna start an IV
and put dressing
over your wound,

01:15.031 --> 01:16.989
but we need to get you
to a hospital.

01:17.033 --> 01:19.514
- On it.
[man groaning]

01:21.951 --> 01:24.040
[engine revving]

01:24.084 --> 01:25.737
- Damn it, Chopper,
go fast but easy!

01:25.781 --> 01:27.696
- This shit ain't paved, Crys!

01:27.739 --> 01:29.654
[tense music]

01:31.178 --> 01:34.094
- Tell Thompson
we're coming in hot.

02:06.778 --> 02:10.260
[woman over PA system]:
Attention, passengers.
The 16-15 bus to Windy Lake

02:10.304 --> 02:13.785
making all stops is now
pre-boarding on Bay 1.

02:13.829 --> 02:15.004
- Excuse me?

02:15.047 --> 02:17.311
You wouldn't happen to know

02:17.354 --> 02:19.182
which direction the airport is,
would you?

02:19.226 --> 02:21.924
- Got five skids of produce
here, two pop.

02:21.967 --> 02:23.447
We can send it
on the sched, or...

02:23.491 --> 02:24.796
[indistinct radio chatter]

02:24.840 --> 02:27.451
Freighter it is. I'll get
a Caravan loaded. Bye.

02:30.976 --> 02:32.804
Cargo or passenger?

02:32.848 --> 02:34.589
- Um... SkyMed?

02:34.632 --> 02:38.201
Someone was supposed to pick me
up from the bus depot.

02:38.245 --> 02:39.724
- Damn it, Brad must have
forgot.

02:39.768 --> 02:41.944
You're Hayley Roberts,
right? The new nurse?

02:41.987 --> 02:43.075
- Yeah.

02:43.119 --> 02:45.165
- Thompson's small.
SkyMed's smaller.

02:45.208 --> 02:47.210
I'm Lexi, by the way.

02:47.254 --> 02:49.473
Some of your boxes came today.

02:49.517 --> 02:51.475
The cargo guys in Winnipeg
are animals.

02:51.519 --> 02:53.216
If any of your stuff's broken,
just let me know.

02:53.260 --> 02:54.652
I'll kick their asses.

02:54.696 --> 02:57.177
[upbeat music continues]

03:07.535 --> 03:10.015
- Bodie! Last trip up, huh?

03:10.059 --> 03:12.104
- Fingers crossed, man.

03:12.148 --> 03:14.498
[all cheering]
- Guess who's back, baby?

03:14.542 --> 03:16.935
- Oh, yeah!
[laughing]

03:16.979 --> 03:19.547
- Mr. Air Canada!

03:21.505 --> 03:24.291
How you doing, playboy?

03:24.334 --> 03:25.770
- You dicks.

03:25.814 --> 03:27.642
I don't even got the job yet.
- Good as.

03:27.685 --> 03:30.819
You... are the golden boy.
- This is extra.

03:30.862 --> 03:32.908
[cheering]
- Let's go!

03:32.951 --> 03:35.650
[hip-hop music]

03:36.955 --> 03:39.306
[cheering]

03:40.176 --> 03:42.265
So, what was the sit-down like?

03:42.309 --> 03:44.311
Hey, did they ask about
breaking air regs?

03:44.354 --> 03:47.096
- No, the sit-down was nothing.
It's the psych eval
you gotta worry about.

03:47.139 --> 03:49.011
- Did they ask you
the suicide question?

03:49.054 --> 03:52.014
- Ten different ways over
300 multiple choice.
But dude, get this...

03:52.057 --> 03:55.931
They asked if
I'd rather be a florist
or a poet?

03:55.974 --> 03:57.367
- What does that mean?

03:57.411 --> 03:59.369
God, I wish I would've taken
the psych course at UCN.

03:59.413 --> 04:01.937
- Hey, it's not too late.
You still gotta take that
Left Seat when I leave.

04:01.980 --> 04:04.374
- I want your room, too.
The heating vent actually works.

04:04.418 --> 04:05.941
- It's yours.

04:05.984 --> 04:08.335
- Yeah, about that, Boderton.

04:08.378 --> 04:10.815
I had to temporarily
commandeer your bed.

04:10.859 --> 04:12.904
- And what'd you do to piss
Lynn off this time?

04:12.948 --> 04:16.430
- I'm trying to give her
a few days to cool down
before I go home to ask.

04:17.474 --> 04:20.956
- Uh, is this the SkyMed
crew residence?

04:26.962 --> 04:29.181
- Dibs.
- Okay, okay!

04:29.225 --> 04:31.183
Why don't you studs...

04:31.227 --> 04:33.229
You guys go help her
with her stuff.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.622
- Hey.
- Yeah, I got her.

04:34.665 --> 04:36.406
- Alright, you guys, you heard
what Wheezer said.

04:36.450 --> 04:37.973
Let's make her feel welcome.

04:38.016 --> 04:41.063
- Pilots... Cool enough to
handle 15,000 pounds of aluminum

04:41.106 --> 04:43.718
at 310 knots,
and they stove it in
over a pretty girl.

04:43.761 --> 04:45.763
[chuckling]
I'm Wheezer, by the way.

04:45.807 --> 04:48.592
- Hayley. Do they, um,
all live here?

04:48.636 --> 04:50.594
- Yup, all the medevac crews,
nurses, pilots...

04:50.638 --> 04:52.466
When you're on duty,
you're on call 24/7,

04:52.509 --> 04:54.381
so it's just more efficient
to keep everyone together.

04:54.424 --> 04:57.949
Actually, it's really nice,
really cozy being
on top of each other.

04:57.993 --> 05:00.517
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, you
know, dust-ups, hook-ups,

05:00.561 --> 05:04.347
break-ups, drunk-ups,
throw ups...

05:04.391 --> 05:06.218
God, I miss this house.

05:06.262 --> 05:08.960
Hey, why don't I give you
the tour?

05:09.004 --> 05:12.355
- Thanks.
- Come on in.
This is the kitchen.

05:12.399 --> 05:16.359
Gentlemen... And the
laundry room's down here.

05:16.403 --> 05:18.100
- Welcome back, babe!

05:18.143 --> 05:19.667
[laughing]

05:21.277 --> 05:23.801
- Mads, what are you doing here?

05:23.845 --> 05:27.022
- Celebrating! I've already been
looking online,

05:27.065 --> 05:30.330
and I found so many
great apartments
for when we move to Toronto.

05:30.373 --> 05:33.071
God, I cannot wait
to live in a big city!

05:33.115 --> 05:35.204
- Madison...
[sighing]

05:35.247 --> 05:36.988
We need to talk.

05:37.032 --> 05:39.817
[soft music]

05:52.874 --> 05:54.397
[phone ringing tone]

05:54.441 --> 05:56.181
[Dad]: Hey, Hayley.
Did you make it up okay?

05:56.225 --> 05:58.227
I thought your bus was supposed
to get in at three.

05:58.270 --> 06:01.404
- Yeah. Why, um... Why is there
a referral in my stuff, Dad?

06:01.448 --> 06:03.711
- I asked your doctor.

06:03.754 --> 06:06.714
If you insist on moving up
there, you're going to need
a specialist.

06:06.757 --> 06:09.499
- No, I don't.
There's nothing wrong with me.

06:09.543 --> 06:12.067
- Hayley, you can't keep
putting it off.

06:12.110 --> 06:14.896
How long are you
going to be up there for?

06:14.939 --> 06:18.073
- Look, Dad, I gotta go.
I have an early day tomorrow.

06:18.116 --> 06:20.075
[phone beeps]

06:20.118 --> 06:22.643
[sighing]

06:35.046 --> 06:38.398
[rhythmic music]

06:45.753 --> 06:50.322
[Chopper]: Thompson radio, this
is SkyMed 911 VFR to North House

06:50.366 --> 06:53.064
taxiing off of runway 006.

06:53.108 --> 06:56.154
[rhythmic music continues]

07:21.963 --> 07:26.402
So, this is just the airstrip.
The community's west of here.

07:26.446 --> 07:29.492
So, a volunteer will drive you
to the Nursing Station
for the patient.

07:29.536 --> 07:32.321
- What, uh, Nation is this?
- Don't ask him,

07:32.364 --> 07:35.498
he doesn't know shit
about anything up here.
He's from Forest Hill.

07:35.542 --> 07:38.283
- Go Raps.
[car horn honking]

07:38.327 --> 07:40.808
[speaking Nêhiyawwin]

07:40.851 --> 07:43.288
- Hey, somebody call
an ambulance?

07:43.332 --> 07:46.248
'Cause you got my blood
pumping in all the wrong places!

07:46.291 --> 07:48.468
Oh! What's up, Crys?
[laughing]

07:48.511 --> 07:50.339
Whoa, who's your friend?

07:50.382 --> 07:53.777
- I'm Hayley.
- Ignore him. Get in.

07:53.821 --> 07:56.432
- Ah, don't worry about her.
Why yes, my name is Jeremy,

07:56.476 --> 07:58.782
and yeah, I am a stunning
specimen of manliness.
You'd know, eh, Crys?

07:58.826 --> 08:02.525
- Shuy! Shut up and drive.

08:02.569 --> 08:05.093
- OMG, you got it?!
[excited squealing]

08:05.136 --> 08:08.052
You are the best.
- This came out this morning.

08:08.096 --> 08:09.793
- The internet is super dodgy
up here,

08:09.837 --> 08:12.100
so I gotta Pin stuff
old school.

08:12.143 --> 08:13.536
Okay!

08:13.580 --> 08:16.844
This is Ernest, a 50-year-old
with type 2 diabetes

08:16.887 --> 08:18.628
going to Island Lake
for dialysis.

08:18.672 --> 08:21.196
Vitals stable, latest
blood work within normal range.

08:36.037 --> 08:37.908
- Okay, ready to go.

08:40.345 --> 08:43.218
Pulse oximeter, BP cuff...
All good.

08:44.698 --> 08:47.135
- Nurse Roberts
says we're good to go.

08:51.835 --> 08:53.576
- Whoa!

08:53.620 --> 08:55.665
[grunting]

09:00.496 --> 09:02.759
- Always strap
the patient in.

09:02.803 --> 09:04.456
- Right.

09:04.500 --> 09:07.547
[indistinct radio chatter]

09:29.351 --> 09:31.614
[whirring]

09:33.877 --> 09:35.705
[Dispatch]: 911,
this is Dispatch.

09:35.749 --> 09:38.273
- Dispatch, this is 911.
Go ahead.

09:38.316 --> 09:41.145
- Now that you've dropped off
your patient, you're being
redeployed to Carnegie Hydro Dam

09:41.189 --> 09:43.626
for emergency pick up
and transport to Winnipeg.

09:43.670 --> 09:45.628
- Here we go.
Time for the real deal.

09:48.196 --> 09:50.807
- The fans were shut down
for maintenance.

09:50.851 --> 09:52.374
They should never have come on.

09:52.417 --> 09:55.725
- Hi, I'm your flight nurse
Crystal, and this is Hayley.

09:55.769 --> 09:58.772
We're from SkyMed.
We're gonna have a look, okay?

10:00.643 --> 10:02.732
Can you tell me your name
and where we are?

10:02.776 --> 10:03.994
[shuddering]
- Steve.

10:04.038 --> 10:05.692
We're at the...
we're at hydro dam.

10:05.735 --> 10:08.042
- The big risk here is
not knowing the extent
of his injuries.

10:08.085 --> 10:10.740
We could be dealing
with internal bleeding,
head injuries, fractures,

10:10.784 --> 10:13.134
but we won't know until we get
him to Winnipeg for imaging.

10:13.177 --> 10:15.745
- Multiple lacerations
and contusions,

10:15.789 --> 10:17.268
but none of them
look too deep.

10:17.312 --> 10:19.575
Laceration on the chest
appears superficial.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.447
- We want him stable as possible
before we get on the plane.

10:22.491 --> 10:26.756
Once we're in the air,
doing anything, even giving
drugs gets a lot harder.

10:31.587 --> 10:33.502
- Hey! So...

10:33.545 --> 10:37.506
Sounds like Bodie's gonna be
heading to AC before winter,
lucky bastard.

10:37.549 --> 10:40.552
- Soon as he does,
you're looking at number four
in line for a right seat.

10:40.596 --> 10:41.771
- Ooh-wee!

10:41.815 --> 10:44.644
That deserves a beer
to celebrate.

10:44.687 --> 10:46.471
When you gonna let me
buy you one, huh?

10:46.515 --> 10:47.777
- When we don't work together.

10:47.821 --> 10:49.736
- Oh, come on, Lex!

10:49.779 --> 10:52.913
Nine out of ten female pilots
don't make it to the cockpit
up here.

10:52.956 --> 10:54.697
Why not have a little fun?

10:54.741 --> 10:56.786
- 'Cause I didn't bust my ass
through seven years of Air
Cadets

10:56.830 --> 10:58.701
and four years of a Commercial
Aviation degree

10:58.745 --> 11:01.356
to not be that one out of ten,
B-rad.

11:01.399 --> 11:03.358
- Okay!

11:06.361 --> 11:07.754
[indistinct radio chatter]

11:07.797 --> 11:10.104
- How you holding up, Steve?
Okay?

11:11.845 --> 11:14.456
- You know I wasn't even
supposed to work today?

11:16.197 --> 11:18.199
Picked up a shift.

11:20.027 --> 11:22.682
It's my kid's birthday
next week.

11:23.944 --> 11:27.599
He wanted a... bike.
[medical machines beeping]

11:27.643 --> 11:30.515
[Steve grunting]

11:30.559 --> 11:32.256
- His O2 sats are dropping.

11:32.300 --> 11:34.084
[machines beeping rapidly]

11:38.741 --> 11:41.091
- Decreased lung sounds
right side.

11:41.875 --> 11:43.790
He's got a sucking chest wound.

11:43.833 --> 11:47.228
- He needs a chest tube
or his pneumo will tension
and he'll arrest.

11:47.271 --> 11:48.838
- You didn't flag this
before we took off?!

11:48.882 --> 11:50.231
- I-I thought it was
superficial.

11:50.274 --> 11:51.667
- Get him on oxygen, now!

11:51.711 --> 11:53.800
- We're still 45 minutes away
from Winnipeg, we...

11:53.843 --> 11:56.411
We don't have the proper
equipment, we're not qualified!

11:56.454 --> 11:59.849
- You're thinking
hospital protocols, okay?
This is a medevac.

11:59.893 --> 12:01.721
There's only us and what
we have on this plane.

12:01.764 --> 12:03.244
We need to divert to Thompson.

12:03.287 --> 12:05.376
Tell Dispatch to have an
ambulance meet us on the ground.

12:05.420 --> 12:06.856
[pilot]: Copy that.
- This is the North.

12:06.900 --> 12:09.206
We make do with what we have,
or people die.

12:09.250 --> 12:11.121
[Steve grunting]

12:14.603 --> 12:19.303
35-year-old male, impact
with an industrial fan grill
at a high rate of speed.

12:19.347 --> 12:21.392
Patient presented with
pneumothorax, mid-flight.

12:21.436 --> 12:25.179
- Resourceful as always,
Crystal. Bay 3,
prep for a chest tube. I got it.

12:27.137 --> 12:30.662
- They'll give him a tube,
evaluate his injuries.

12:30.706 --> 12:33.100
It's just our job
to get them here alive.

12:33.143 --> 12:34.884
After that, he's their problem.

12:34.928 --> 12:37.887
[indistinct PA announcement]

12:37.931 --> 12:40.411
What did you work
before you came up here?

12:40.455 --> 12:43.588
ER, ICU, Critical Care?

12:43.632 --> 12:45.373
- L&D.

12:46.635 --> 12:49.812
- Labour and Delivery?
Jesus Christ.

12:49.856 --> 12:51.814
- I-I worked at Sinai,

12:51.858 --> 12:54.251
the most high-risk birthing
centre in the country.

12:54.295 --> 12:56.384
- That's the training
you came up here with?

12:56.427 --> 12:58.386
You see how little
we're working with,

12:58.429 --> 13:01.345
and on top of that,
we get stuck
with someone like you?

13:01.389 --> 13:03.565
- I'm a good nurse.

13:03.608 --> 13:06.220
- So am I. In a relevant field.

13:06.263 --> 13:08.048
What the hell made you
come up here?

13:08.091 --> 13:11.442
You know what? This may just be
some fun adventure to you,

13:11.486 --> 13:12.835
but this is our lives.

13:12.879 --> 13:15.620
We take care of our own
because no one else will.

13:15.664 --> 13:18.928
And if you can't handle that,
you shouldn't be here.

13:18.972 --> 13:21.888
[door opening]

13:29.591 --> 13:31.506
- Ladies! You're just in time.

13:31.549 --> 13:34.639
I got the barbecue all fired up
for a welcome dinner for Hayley.

13:34.683 --> 13:37.860
- Um... I'm too tired to eat.

13:37.904 --> 13:39.601
Thanks, though, Wheezer.

13:44.693 --> 13:46.390
[door slamming]

13:48.349 --> 13:50.307
- Just say it.

13:51.091 --> 13:53.223
- I flew you down to Winnipeg

13:53.267 --> 13:55.486
when you went to Nursing School,
and you cried the whole way.

13:55.530 --> 13:57.924
New experiences are hard.
- You don't have to fly
with her.

13:57.967 --> 14:00.622
- The North challenges people,
Crys. Makes them grow.

14:00.665 --> 14:03.320
And it's not always pleasant,
but you gotta give them
the room to do that growing.

14:03.364 --> 14:05.975
- Do you know how many
"Hayleys" I've had to train?

14:06.019 --> 14:08.456
They come up here thinking
they'll have some fun

14:08.499 --> 14:10.284
and make big bucks,
and then they leave.

14:10.327 --> 14:13.026
Because they can't hack it,
okay?

14:13.069 --> 14:16.594
The "Hayleys" never stay.
And this one won't either.

14:21.034 --> 14:23.775
- You wanna just throw yourself
on my AK?

14:23.819 --> 14:26.213
Always on your phone, bro.

14:28.650 --> 14:33.089
Dude. Are you that sweaty for
an offer from a major airline?

14:33.133 --> 14:35.570
They're not gonna send it out
after midnight, you butthead.

14:35.613 --> 14:37.311
- You did my Line Indoc,
butthead.

14:37.354 --> 14:39.400
You know how long it took me
to get this interview.

14:39.443 --> 14:40.880
- Mm-hmm.

14:40.923 --> 14:43.012
- You really never wanted
to play in the big leagues?

14:43.056 --> 14:45.754
- No, man. Who the hell is
gonna hire a weirdo like me?

14:45.797 --> 14:47.190
- Anyone?
[scoffing]

14:47.234 --> 14:48.931
You're a damn good driver,
Wheez.

14:48.975 --> 14:51.064
You have over 10,000 hours.

14:51.107 --> 14:53.022
- I like it up here.

14:53.066 --> 14:55.590
- Okay, nobody likes it up here.
- Oh, yes they do.

14:55.633 --> 14:57.244
They do like it here if
they don't wanna mess

14:57.287 --> 15:00.029
with that bullshit
corporate culture down south.

15:00.073 --> 15:03.250
"A poet or a florist?"
- I said florist.

15:03.293 --> 15:04.904
- Eh...

15:04.947 --> 15:06.427
- Maybe I should've gone
poet? Or...

15:06.470 --> 15:08.646
- Greenhorns, you're so
worried about getting somewhere,

15:08.690 --> 15:11.867
you never stop to think
if you're going
where you should.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.043
Like directly
into my ambush, son!

15:14.087 --> 15:16.828
- Shit!
- Boom! Headshot. Boom!

15:16.872 --> 15:19.048
[Wheezer laughing]

15:20.615 --> 15:22.356
[phone ringing]

15:43.768 --> 15:45.640
- Crys!

15:48.034 --> 15:50.950
Okay, look, I'm not
stupid enough to wake you, okay?

15:50.993 --> 15:52.168
- Sure looks like you are.

15:52.212 --> 15:56.303
- I, uh... I had
a little hunting accident.

16:01.830 --> 16:05.007
- I gotta do this fast
before anyone sees you here.

16:05.051 --> 16:07.401
- Come on, lady.
My six-pack's over here.
Come on.

16:07.444 --> 16:09.098
[grunting]

16:09.142 --> 16:11.492
Ah. Ow, ow, awas!
What are you doing?

16:11.535 --> 16:13.581
Geez...

16:13.624 --> 16:18.151
- Looks like your "hunting
accident" managed to miss
anything important.

16:21.632 --> 16:23.156
- Hey...

16:25.332 --> 16:29.162
Still smells like you.
Sunshine, sweetgrass, and...

16:29.205 --> 16:31.599
Oh! Rage, okay! Whoa.

16:31.642 --> 16:33.949
- Oops. Guess that's why
I'm not supposed to suture

16:33.993 --> 16:36.430
until I'm a certified NP.

16:39.041 --> 16:42.479
You'll need to see a doctor for
antibiotics and a tetanus shot.

16:42.523 --> 16:44.786
- Yeah, no,
I'm not gonna do that.

16:48.877 --> 16:50.444
- What did you do, hmm?

16:50.487 --> 16:53.012
Steal some of that crap you sell
from the dogs you work for?

16:53.055 --> 16:54.491
- No. I...

16:54.535 --> 16:57.886
No, I... told
the wrong people "no".

16:58.365 --> 17:00.193
Look, just because you and I
don't have the same lines,

17:00.236 --> 17:01.846
doesn't mean I don't have them,
alright?

17:01.890 --> 17:03.718
I'm trying to help
the community, Crys.
Same as you.

17:03.761 --> 17:06.286
[scoffing]
- No one needs
your kind of help.

17:06.329 --> 17:08.853
- At least I'm here.
You left. I stayed.

17:08.897 --> 17:11.247
- Yeah, and you bitched me out
about it for years.

17:11.291 --> 17:13.989
North House is my home, too,
you know?

17:14.033 --> 17:16.165
- Is it?
- My family are here.

17:19.125 --> 17:22.432
- Uh... sorry.

17:38.231 --> 17:40.276
- Hey. You ready to load,
Chopper?

17:40.320 --> 17:42.409
- Yeah. Ready to go.

17:46.413 --> 17:51.287
Hey, uh... I like your braid.
It's really, uh... neat.

17:52.506 --> 17:55.596
[chuckling]
I meant neat like "tidy".

17:55.639 --> 17:58.077
Not neat like "cool".
Nobody says neat for cool.

17:58.120 --> 18:00.470
'Cause that's a lame thing
to say.

18:00.514 --> 18:02.951
Much like calling someone tidy.

18:02.994 --> 18:04.996
- Hey, Chops.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.563
Fuel truck's coming.

18:08.217 --> 18:10.263
- Hey, Tristan.

18:10.306 --> 18:11.916
- Heads up, rookie.

18:11.960 --> 18:14.397
Ready for the most
important training
you'll ever get?

18:14.441 --> 18:17.748
Eat when you can, pee when
you can, and sleep when you can.

18:17.792 --> 18:20.011
Oh, and dibs on the stretcher.

18:20.055 --> 18:22.405
[airplane whirring]

18:27.410 --> 18:29.804
- I'm not getting on that
effing plane!

18:31.980 --> 18:34.200
- Whoa, hey!

18:34.243 --> 18:36.811
What's going on, Cherie?

18:36.854 --> 18:41.120
- This cranky-ass môniyaskwew
is trying to hijack my pregnant
butt, that's what's going on!

18:41.163 --> 18:44.253
You said you were just
gonna give me
some prenatal vitamins.

18:44.297 --> 18:46.690
- You're going to have your
baby any day now, Cherie.

18:46.734 --> 18:48.649
You need to go to Winnipeg,
you know that.

18:48.692 --> 18:51.869
- No. I did that with my last
kid, and it sucked.

18:51.913 --> 18:55.743
Sitting alone in a nasty motel
for weeks waiting
to go into labour?

18:55.786 --> 18:59.442
I'm not doing it again.
I want to be here
with my family.

18:59.486 --> 19:01.966
- Cherie, right?
Do you remember me?

19:02.010 --> 19:03.925
We sort of met
at the bus station.

19:03.968 --> 19:05.448
Anyways, I'm new here.

19:05.492 --> 19:07.842
But I used to be a labour
and delivery nurse in Toronto,

19:07.885 --> 19:09.713
and it looks like
you might be having some pain.

19:09.757 --> 19:12.151
Do you want me to take a look
to make sure everything's okay?

19:12.194 --> 19:13.935
- I'm not going to that
bullshit plane.

19:13.978 --> 19:15.937
- We can do it here.

19:15.980 --> 19:19.506
Yeah, trust me, I'm in no rush
to get back on that bullshit
plane either.

19:26.556 --> 19:29.994
- She's got to go, Tristan.
You know she's got to.

19:30.038 --> 19:32.606
I'm not trying to be a bully,
this is just how it is.

19:32.649 --> 19:34.390
- I know, Camille.
- There's no doctor,

19:34.434 --> 19:36.653
there's no help for hours
if something goes wrong.

19:36.697 --> 19:39.395
At 36 weeks, they have
to go to Winnipeg.

19:39.439 --> 19:42.137
- Hey. I know, I took her there
myself three weeks ago.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.052
AÀ- Yeah, well,
somehow she came back.

19:44.095 --> 19:47.186
- It must be scary, to have your
baby in a new place all alone.

19:47.229 --> 19:49.405
You really don't get a choice?

19:50.493 --> 19:54.497
- I'm having this baby here,
on the land.

19:54.541 --> 19:58.240
Even if I gotta squat
in a tree to do it.

20:03.898 --> 20:05.856
- Okay, I'll tell you what.

20:05.900 --> 20:09.338
If you promise to go to
Thompson to get checked after...

20:10.252 --> 20:12.385
I'll help you have your baby
here.

20:14.561 --> 20:16.519
I need your obstetrics kit.

20:16.563 --> 20:19.348
Now, we won't be able to give
you anything for the pain.

20:19.392 --> 20:21.481
So is there any family
you want to have here?

20:21.524 --> 20:24.527
- You can't do that!
I can't deliver a baby here.

20:26.007 --> 20:28.270
- I can.

20:28.314 --> 20:30.011
- Camille's not wrong.

20:30.054 --> 20:32.709
I mean, we are a long way away
from help if we need it.

20:32.753 --> 20:34.798
We should fly her out
for her own safety.

20:34.842 --> 20:36.626
- There isn't any time.
She's a multip,

20:36.670 --> 20:38.454
and she's already
seven centimetres dilated.

20:38.498 --> 20:40.369
So we can either deliver her
here, or at 20,000 feet,

20:40.413 --> 20:42.893
but this baby's coming.

20:49.900 --> 20:51.946
- Baby's coming.

20:54.557 --> 20:57.517
[indistinct chattering]

20:57.560 --> 21:00.302
- Heard you had a fun
bear attack.

21:00.346 --> 21:03.610
- Brought him into Dr. Denning
right after you left
for the night, Trevor.

21:03.653 --> 21:05.612
- Oof. Ouch.

21:05.655 --> 21:07.962
And I thought we had something
special going
with that chainsaw accident.

21:08.005 --> 21:09.703
Doesn't a partial amputation
mean anything these days?

21:09.746 --> 21:11.922
- Girl's gotta keep her options
open.

21:11.966 --> 21:15.578
[chuckling]
- Thought you might need this
to get you through practical.

21:15.622 --> 21:19.234
- Thanks, but, uh...
I don't need any more caffeine.

21:19.278 --> 21:22.585
My Kookum would kick my ass
if these stitches
weren't straight.

21:22.629 --> 21:25.414
- Not bad. Better than you see
in some ERs.

21:25.458 --> 21:27.416
I mean, maybe not my ER, but...

21:27.460 --> 21:29.462
Hey, you sure you want to be
a Nurse Practitioner?

21:29.505 --> 21:33.466
- No. That's why I'm busting
my ass working full-time
while I do a masters?

21:33.509 --> 21:35.946
- Why not bust ass...
in med school?

21:35.990 --> 21:38.122
Crystal, you're smart.

21:38.166 --> 21:39.602
You've got a ton
of field experience.

21:39.646 --> 21:41.082
We both know
you could do my job.

21:41.125 --> 21:42.605
Maybe even as good as I do it.

21:42.649 --> 21:44.433
- Better looking,
for damn sure.

21:44.477 --> 21:46.522
- Listen, my buddy works
for a program at U of M

21:46.566 --> 21:48.742
that supports Indigenous
students in med school.

21:48.785 --> 21:51.440
There are programs at McGill,
U of T...

21:51.484 --> 21:54.051
You can leave Thompson,
you know?

21:54.095 --> 21:55.923
- I leave Thompson all the time.

21:55.966 --> 21:59.796
I leave to go to Shamattawa,
I leave to go to The Pas...

21:59.840 --> 22:01.407
- Okay, alright.

22:01.450 --> 22:04.714
You know, it's a big
world out there, Crystal.

22:04.758 --> 22:07.630
And I think you'd set it
on fire.

22:09.850 --> 22:12.069
[soft music]

22:20.774 --> 22:23.646
[phone beeping]
- Hey, uh, do you think

22:23.690 --> 22:25.474
I should take Hayley to the dump
to see the bears?

22:25.518 --> 22:27.346
Chicks love animals... right?

22:27.389 --> 22:28.521
- You gotta chill, dude.

22:28.564 --> 22:31.001
- Okay. Bodie, she's pretty.

22:31.045 --> 22:35.745
And smart, and, uh... nice.

22:36.398 --> 22:38.444
Come on, man,
I need some A-game.

22:38.487 --> 22:40.663
- Chops, you are the A-game.
You're a catch.

22:40.707 --> 22:43.405
So chill on the bears, okay?

22:43.449 --> 22:45.712
[birds chirping]

22:45.755 --> 22:47.583
[crow cawing]

22:47.627 --> 22:49.063
- Yep.

22:51.761 --> 22:53.894
[groaning]

22:53.937 --> 22:56.070
[panting]

22:59.073 --> 23:01.249
- That was perfect, Cherie.

23:01.292 --> 23:04.383
Give me another good one
just like that on your next
contraction, okay?

23:04.426 --> 23:06.080
You got towels
and suction ready?

23:07.037 --> 23:09.257
- Yeah.
[panting]

23:09.300 --> 23:13.392
[whimpering]

23:14.958 --> 23:16.917
- Okay, the head's out.

23:16.960 --> 23:19.354
I don't feel a cord. Let's get
those shoulders delivered.

23:19.398 --> 23:22.662
[Cherie groaning, panting]

23:28.929 --> 23:32.106
Okay, I'm just going
to rotate baby, okay?

23:33.803 --> 23:37.546
Alright, Mom. I want you to put
your hands under baby's armpits,

23:37.590 --> 23:41.071
and on your next push, I want
you to pull baby up, okay?

23:41.115 --> 23:43.117
Okay, here we go.

23:43.160 --> 23:45.293
[groaning]

23:45.336 --> 23:47.643
[baby crying]

23:54.563 --> 23:56.478
- That hard part's over, Mama.

23:56.522 --> 23:58.698
Tristan, at two minutes,
we'll clamp the cord to cut.

23:58.741 --> 24:01.396
- I need the placenta.
I have to wrap it,

24:01.440 --> 24:04.443
put it in a tree
to root the baby in the land.

24:08.882 --> 24:12.886
[soft music]

24:26.639 --> 24:29.293
- Hope that's not coming
in here. It's full up.

24:29.337 --> 24:30.947
- Then make room.

24:30.991 --> 24:34.124
Look, the sched didn't make it
up to North House yesterday

24:34.168 --> 24:36.387
because of the weather.
We gotta double up.

24:36.431 --> 24:38.172
There's two more skids
in that hangar.

24:38.215 --> 24:40.479
- Dude, any more and I won't
be able to secure the straps.

24:40.522 --> 24:43.482
- You don't need to use
all the straps.
- I do for a load this bulky.

24:43.525 --> 24:47.050
- Look, these communities rely
on us to fly in vital supplies.

24:47.094 --> 24:49.531
They can't get cut off
because you don't know
how to pack a plane properly.

24:49.575 --> 24:53.274
- I can pack a plane.
But I can't violate
Aviation Authority rules.

24:53.317 --> 24:55.798
- God. Don't be such a pussy.

24:56.886 --> 24:58.366
Okay...

24:58.845 --> 25:02.370
All this goes in the plane
or you go.

25:02.413 --> 25:04.633
Got it?

25:06.417 --> 25:08.942
[scoffing]
Seriously?!

25:10.378 --> 25:12.336
[sighing]

25:12.380 --> 25:14.121
Shit.

25:16.689 --> 25:19.169
- Yo, Hayley delivered
a freaking baby!

25:19.213 --> 25:21.998
You don't understand, there
was a woman that didn't want to
get on the plane, right?

25:22.042 --> 25:23.739
And she was like,
super dilated and stuff,

25:23.783 --> 25:25.785
and Hayley was all,
"No big deal, I got this!"

25:25.828 --> 25:27.830
And she delivers a baby
with her bare hands!

25:27.874 --> 25:29.484
[laughing]

25:29.528 --> 25:32.356
Didn't see any of it, but still,
it sounds super badass, right?

25:32.400 --> 25:34.445
- Oh, I saw it,
and it was badass.

25:34.489 --> 25:36.404
The patient's family
even gave us gifts.

25:36.447 --> 25:38.275
- Yeah, they gave us moose meat.

25:38.319 --> 25:40.539
- Saving the day
and bringing home the bacon.
Best flight nurse ever.

25:40.582 --> 25:42.889
- They won't all be pregnant.

25:47.589 --> 25:49.983
- What is your problem?

25:51.288 --> 25:53.682
You don't know me.
You don't know
why I came up here.

25:53.726 --> 25:55.728
- I know you have no business
being up here.

25:55.771 --> 25:58.600
Maybe you got lucky today,
but the kind of crap
we deal with on the regular?

25:58.644 --> 26:00.689
That takes a real nurse.
- Or maybe...

26:00.733 --> 26:03.953
Maybe you're pissed that
I can recognize a stab wound

26:03.997 --> 26:06.347
and know that it has to be
reported to police.

26:09.437 --> 26:12.832
Don't worry.
I can keep a secret.

26:13.441 --> 26:15.878
- Guess we'll see, won't we?

26:18.707 --> 26:21.580
[door opening and closing]

26:22.537 --> 26:24.495
[sighing]

26:24.539 --> 26:26.846
[soft music]

26:27.760 --> 26:30.066
[phone chiming]

26:33.635 --> 26:35.942
[birds chirping]

26:38.292 --> 26:41.469
- Didn't think you had enough
kindling in there
for a helmet fire, Grodie.

26:41.512 --> 26:45.342
What happened?
Did they stop making headsets
in child-size?

26:45.386 --> 26:47.127
- Bite me, No-sack.

26:47.170 --> 26:49.520
- Not my type, Chodie.

26:49.564 --> 26:51.174
[sighing]

26:52.785 --> 26:55.309
- Let's go, Bodie.
We got a call.

27:00.793 --> 27:03.796
[phone buzzing]

27:07.582 --> 27:09.279
- Don't need to borrow this
after all.

27:09.323 --> 27:10.933
- You're not planning
on driving this winter?

27:10.977 --> 27:12.761
- Not planning on being here
this winter.

27:12.805 --> 27:15.372
Brad tried to force me
to overload a plane.

27:15.416 --> 27:17.766
- A little overload? Or...

27:17.810 --> 27:21.117
- I walked out. Or he got angry
and fired me.

27:21.161 --> 27:22.466
Depends who you ask.

27:22.510 --> 27:24.947
So now I'm out of a job
and my spot on the ramp.

27:24.991 --> 27:26.906
I'll have to leave Thompson,

27:26.949 --> 27:29.604
go find some other crap town
with an airport in the middle
of nowhere,

27:29.648 --> 27:31.301
and start all over again.

27:31.345 --> 27:33.956
[plane whirring overhead]

27:35.479 --> 27:39.745
All I've ever wanted from the
first time I sat in the glider
in cadets was to fly.

27:39.788 --> 27:42.008
And I just threw it away.

27:42.704 --> 27:44.575
I know what
you're going to say.

27:44.619 --> 27:48.405
"That was real stupid, Lexi.
You should've just kept
your mouth shut

27:48.449 --> 27:50.886
and gone along with it, Lexi."

27:54.150 --> 27:56.196
[sighing]

27:57.501 --> 27:59.982
- I'm not going to say that.

28:07.511 --> 28:09.165
- Can you hear me now?

28:09.209 --> 28:11.515
What about now?

28:11.559 --> 28:14.170
- A week? I thought you were
gonna be here to help me study
Immunology.

28:14.214 --> 28:16.738
- I know, but this is killer
overtime, babe.

28:16.782 --> 28:18.479
And I want a big wedding.

28:18.522 --> 28:20.350
[sighing]
- I miss you.

28:20.394 --> 28:23.484
Emma...
[audio cutting]

28:23.527 --> 28:24.746
[phone beeping]

28:24.790 --> 28:26.748
[door opening]
- Shit.

28:26.792 --> 28:29.185
- There's an accident
at the airstrip.

28:29.229 --> 28:31.492
[beeping]

28:32.841 --> 28:34.843
- What's this code?

28:34.887 --> 28:37.498
- Flight Operations
Alert Emergency.

28:38.804 --> 28:40.544
One of the fleet's
gone down.

28:40.588 --> 28:42.503
[Dispatch]: 911,
this is Dispatch.

28:42.546 --> 28:45.636
You are diverting for an
emergency call in North House.

28:45.680 --> 28:48.074
[tense music]

29:06.527 --> 29:08.181
- The pilot, he's pinned.

29:08.224 --> 29:10.226
The cargo slid forward,
I couldn't get to him.

29:10.270 --> 29:11.967
- Go to the station,
man the radio.

29:12.011 --> 29:15.449
Keep Dispatch in the loop
and tell Winnipeg
to be ready for us.

29:18.321 --> 29:20.889
- Wheezer?! I'm coming
for you, buddy!

29:20.933 --> 29:23.805
- Wheezer? Wheezer!

29:37.471 --> 29:40.126
- Crissy? Crissy.

29:41.127 --> 29:43.825
- Hey. Hey, it's me, buddy.
I'm here.

29:43.869 --> 29:45.784
- I can't move.

29:45.827 --> 29:48.221
- Yeah, you crashed your plane,
Wheez.

29:48.264 --> 29:51.354
You got a couple hundred
kilos of beans and condensed
milk up your ass.

29:51.398 --> 29:54.009
- I can't feel my legs.

29:54.053 --> 29:56.838
- Bodie's gonna get you out.
- No, no, no, no.

29:56.882 --> 29:59.101
It's not safe.
The master's still on.

29:59.145 --> 30:02.888
[panting]
I can't move to turn it off.

30:05.760 --> 30:08.719
- Bodes? Bodes!

30:08.763 --> 30:12.245
- There's a ruptured tank
and all the electrics are
still running.

30:12.288 --> 30:14.943
Okay, look, we don't know
what's in the cargo,
how flammable it is.

30:14.987 --> 30:16.423
- Let's get him out fast!

30:16.466 --> 30:18.338
[tense music]

30:21.907 --> 30:23.473
- How many inside?

30:23.517 --> 30:24.997
- Just the pilot.

30:29.044 --> 30:31.177
[Lexi over radio]:
922, go to guns.

30:31.220 --> 30:32.526
- Go ahead.

30:32.569 --> 30:33.701
- Came back in
as soon as I heard.

30:33.744 --> 30:35.224
How bad is it? Is Wheezer okay?

30:35.268 --> 30:37.574
- Depends if we can get him out
before the fuel catches.

30:37.618 --> 30:39.228
- What happened?

30:39.272 --> 30:41.056
- Looks like the 200
was overloaded.
Cargo wasn't secure.

30:41.100 --> 30:43.493
Wheezer must not have known,
came in fast and long.

30:43.537 --> 30:45.234
When he hit the brakes,
the straps snapped.

30:45.278 --> 30:47.410
It all slid forward
and pinned him.

30:48.150 --> 30:50.849
I gotta go. We're all-in.

30:54.765 --> 30:58.378
- The police are on their way,
and Winnipeg's sending
ground support.

30:58.421 --> 31:02.077
- That'll take too long!
Move, move, move!

31:03.949 --> 31:07.126
- My legs are cold.
Can't feel them.

31:07.169 --> 31:09.911
- Stay awake with me, okay?

31:10.825 --> 31:12.044
- Yeah.

31:13.045 --> 31:14.611
- The line's primed.

31:14.655 --> 31:17.136
[breathing heavily]

31:23.229 --> 31:26.058
- Tell me about this fight
you had with Lynn.

31:26.101 --> 31:29.365
Must've been bad if you did
all this just to get out of it.

31:29.409 --> 31:31.498
[chuckling weakly]

31:35.154 --> 31:39.245
- I was such a stupid kid
when I moved up here.

31:40.289 --> 31:45.338
I never thought
I'd find someone,
a woman like her, you know?

31:46.600 --> 31:49.646
I'm so... I'm so lucky.

31:49.690 --> 31:51.126
Lynn...

31:52.998 --> 31:55.914
I've just put her through
so much, you know?

31:56.392 --> 31:57.828
She's so, so...

31:57.872 --> 32:00.570
- Patient? A saint?

32:03.182 --> 32:05.924
- The North makes you grow,
Crissy.

32:05.967 --> 32:08.230
Makes you grow up.

32:10.711 --> 32:12.495
This land...

32:13.801 --> 32:16.543
...raised me, Crissy.

32:20.721 --> 32:22.592
- Wheezer?

32:22.636 --> 32:23.680
Wheezer!

32:23.724 --> 32:26.248
We're out of time!
Get him out, now!

32:26.292 --> 32:28.424
- Okay...

32:31.906 --> 32:34.430
[tense music]

32:37.520 --> 32:40.871
- Let's move!
- Move back! Move back!

32:40.915 --> 32:43.439
Move, please!

32:43.483 --> 32:46.268
[indistinct shouting]

32:51.491 --> 32:54.102
- Ah, I can get him.

33:03.068 --> 33:05.113
- He couldn't feel
his legs, Tristan.

33:05.896 --> 33:09.030
- Stay with us, buddy.
We got you, Wheez.

33:09.074 --> 33:10.989
Easy does it, now.

33:12.686 --> 33:16.342
Easy... There we go.
We're gonna get you out of here.

33:23.523 --> 33:25.742
[grunting]

33:25.786 --> 33:27.222
We're coming out!

33:27.266 --> 33:29.616
- I'll get the backboard.

33:36.231 --> 33:38.451
Set it down over there.

33:38.494 --> 33:41.671
Okay, keep his neck
as stable as possible.
- I got you, I got you.

33:41.715 --> 33:45.588
- We gotta go fast. The whole
thing could blow at any minute.

33:48.113 --> 33:50.463
[indistinct shouting]

33:52.813 --> 33:55.294
- I got his head.

33:59.428 --> 34:02.127
Alright, let's get him
ready to go.

34:10.222 --> 34:12.093
Okay, on my count.

34:12.137 --> 34:14.269
One, two, three.

34:34.246 --> 34:36.770
- Son of a bitch.

34:38.250 --> 34:41.427
[tense music]

34:42.471 --> 34:46.519
[Chopper]: Winnipeg Centre,
this is SkyMed 911 medevac
requesting priority.

35:00.185 --> 35:03.101
[indistinct radio chatter]

35:03.753 --> 35:07.453
- I'm taking the crew van.
[sirens wailing]

35:07.496 --> 35:09.933
- Wait, Bodes! I gotta put
the plane to bed,
I'll come with--

35:09.977 --> 35:12.545
[tires screeching]

35:12.588 --> 35:15.548
[soft music]

35:16.984 --> 35:19.769
[distant sirens wailing]

35:19.813 --> 35:21.815
- Is Wheezer okay?

35:21.858 --> 35:24.774
- They're sending him
to surgery. It'll be a couple
hours before we know.

35:24.818 --> 35:27.386
Crystal's calling his wife.

35:39.180 --> 35:40.660
- You know,

35:40.703 --> 35:42.792
I came up to Thompson
with 250 hours,

35:42.836 --> 35:45.447
a commercial license,
and not a damn clue.

35:45.491 --> 35:47.580
My first few weeks on that ramp,

35:47.623 --> 35:50.278
I thought about getting back
in my car and going home.

35:50.322 --> 35:52.062
- Why didn't you?

35:52.106 --> 35:54.152
- I met Wheezer.

35:54.761 --> 35:57.807
He's the best pilot I know,
the best guy, and if...

35:57.851 --> 35:59.548
[sighing]

36:01.115 --> 36:03.161
If he can't walk...

36:04.510 --> 36:07.165
I can't imagine never
flying again.

36:07.861 --> 36:09.906
It'd feel like...

36:09.950 --> 36:12.257
Like a part of me had died.

36:18.263 --> 36:21.483
- Wheezer... will find a way.

36:23.529 --> 36:26.096
I'm not making light of this.
This...

36:26.140 --> 36:27.881
This is big.

36:30.710 --> 36:34.235
The thing that's gonna kill you
could already be inside of you
right now.

36:34.279 --> 36:36.846
And you don't even know.
You just...

36:36.890 --> 36:38.892
keep going.

36:41.068 --> 36:42.678
That's what we have to do.

36:42.722 --> 36:45.246
We have to live as much life
as we can.

36:45.290 --> 36:47.770
While we can.

36:47.814 --> 36:50.512
[soft music]

37:28.028 --> 37:30.944
[distant plane whirring]

37:38.299 --> 37:40.606
[phone ringing]

37:41.433 --> 37:42.825
- Captain Pierce.
- Martine.

37:42.869 --> 37:45.001
- Sir, I--
- 0800 tomorrow. My office.

37:45.045 --> 37:46.916
[phone hangs up]

37:46.960 --> 37:50.268
[soft music]
[sighing]

37:58.188 --> 38:01.017
[indistinct chattering]

38:14.030 --> 38:16.076
- Wheezer's out of surgery.

38:16.642 --> 38:18.948
His back's broken, but...

38:21.037 --> 38:23.039
He can wiggle his toes.

38:23.083 --> 38:25.041
[upbeat rock music]

38:25.085 --> 38:26.782
- Woo!
- He's gonna be okay.

38:26.826 --> 38:28.567
[all cheering]

38:31.526 --> 38:34.268
- Hey, I love Wheezer too.
But I mean...

38:34.312 --> 38:36.357
It looks like
pilot error to me.

38:36.401 --> 38:39.360
- Not if he didn't know
the plane was overloaded.

38:42.842 --> 38:45.235
- I mean, do we know that
for sure?

38:45.279 --> 38:47.237
- Northern Police is
looking into it.

38:47.281 --> 38:49.327
Aviation Authority
will be, too.

38:49.370 --> 38:51.416
[indistinct chattering]

38:54.201 --> 38:55.942
[chuckling]

39:10.043 --> 39:12.262
- Chopper, look.

39:12.306 --> 39:14.134
I screwed up, Chops.

39:14.177 --> 39:17.355
Okay? After Wheezer,
I was messed up,

39:18.225 --> 39:20.227
- You knew I liked her.

39:21.054 --> 39:24.318
You could get any girl
that you want, Bodes, but...

39:24.362 --> 39:26.712
why'd you have to go after her?

39:31.064 --> 39:33.109
- I got a PFO letter.

39:35.460 --> 39:37.679
I didn't get the job.
- Wait, what?

39:37.723 --> 39:40.290
But how? I mean, you're...
You're Bodie.

39:40.334 --> 39:42.510
- Who knows?

39:42.554 --> 39:45.252
Maybe I screwed up
the cognitive test.

39:45.295 --> 39:46.558
Maybe I flunked
the psych eval.

39:46.601 --> 39:48.690
Maybe they didn't like my tie.
Maybe they...

39:50.257 --> 39:52.390
Maybe they didn't like me.

39:52.433 --> 39:54.174
- Come on, Bode,
everyone loves you.

39:54.217 --> 39:56.045
- Yeah, here.
[scoffing]

39:56.089 --> 39:58.831
In Thompson.

40:00.920 --> 40:03.052
[sighing]

40:03.096 --> 40:05.838
[soft music]

40:14.499 --> 40:16.196
- Why didn't you tell me?

40:16.239 --> 40:18.111
- I didn't want anyone to know.

40:18.894 --> 40:21.593
Not until I figure
something else out.

40:27.381 --> 40:29.514
You'll keep this to yourself,
yeah?

40:29.557 --> 40:32.778
- Of course, man.
I got you.

40:32.821 --> 40:34.997
[sighing]

40:38.131 --> 40:39.741
[chuckling]

40:39.785 --> 40:43.789
- I guess... Guess you won't be
getting my room anymore, huh?

40:46.487 --> 40:48.446
- Let's go back to the party,
Bodes.

40:48.489 --> 40:51.579
Come on. We'll get you a drink.

41:20.521 --> 41:24.525
- Thank you.
For taking care of Wheezer.

41:26.353 --> 41:28.921
- We take care
of our own, right?

41:37.495 --> 41:39.671
[birds chirping]

41:46.982 --> 41:49.811
- Bringing me breakfast
isn't going to work this time,
Mads.

41:49.855 --> 41:52.205
We're not getting back
together.

41:52.814 --> 41:56.252
- I've taken five of these
in the last two days.

41:56.296 --> 42:00.256
I'm done being the only one
who's scared shitless.

42:13.487 --> 42:15.184
- You're early, Martine.

42:15.228 --> 42:17.317
- Captain Pierce. About the
cargo on the plane--

42:17.360 --> 42:18.971
- Do you know William well?

42:19.493 --> 42:21.713
- Everyone loves Wheezer.

42:21.756 --> 42:23.628
Sir, I'd like the opportunity
to explain--

42:23.671 --> 42:27.283
- We're putting
his wife up at an Airbnb
in Winnipeg for his recovery.

42:28.589 --> 42:30.199
No matter how rigorous
maintenance is,

42:30.243 --> 42:31.549
equipment malfunctions happen.

42:31.592 --> 42:33.725
- Equipment? The straps?

42:33.768 --> 42:35.683
- Brad and his team flew up
to look at the crash.

42:35.727 --> 42:38.730
It's been a problem before
with this manufacturer.

42:39.644 --> 42:42.821
Now, with Wheezer
out of commission,

42:42.864 --> 42:44.605
we have to shift pilots around,

42:44.649 --> 42:47.869
which means
there's an opening
in the right seat on a medevac.

42:48.653 --> 42:51.438
Congratulations,
First Officer Martine.

42:52.091 --> 42:54.789
- But there's still three guys
on the ramp ahead of me.

42:54.833 --> 42:56.791
- Well, sometimes we pull
strong candidates up.

42:56.835 --> 42:59.925
Brad called me personally
to put you forward
as the next to go flightline.

42:59.968 --> 43:02.710
You've got a big fan
over there.

43:02.754 --> 43:04.233
Look, we're a small
company, Lexi.

43:04.277 --> 43:07.367
It's times like this
we need to stick together.
