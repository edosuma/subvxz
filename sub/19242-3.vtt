00:55.013 --> 00:58.558
<i>And just like that,</i>
<i>because of that woman I didn't know,</i>

00:58.975 --> 01:00.560
<i>I alone survived.</i>

01:02.937 --> 01:04.105
<i>I am a time traveler.</i>

01:05.440 --> 01:07.942
<i>I travel to the future on the subway.</i>

01:08.735 --> 01:09.652
NAMYEONG

01:09.736 --> 01:11.446
<i>Passing between the accident site</i>

01:12.363 --> 01:14.699
<i>at Namyeong Station and Seoul Station</i>

01:14.783 --> 01:16.618
<i>would allow me to go into the future.</i>

01:17.327 --> 01:20.663
<i>When traveling to the future, I would go</i>
<i>from Namyeong to Seoul Station.</i>

01:21.039 --> 01:24.709
<i>To come back to the present,</i>
<i>I would go from Seoul Station to Namyoung</i>

01:24.793 --> 01:26.503
<i>That's how I should ride the subway.</i>

01:26.586 --> 01:28.421
<i>These were the basics.</i>

01:29.297 --> 01:35.345
<i>It took me three years to learn</i>
<i>how to get to the day I wanted.</i>

01:35.428 --> 01:38.389
<i>At 9:15 p.m., March 25, 2019.</i>

01:39.432 --> 01:41.142
<i>That's the time that you will die.</i>

01:41.726 --> 01:45.730
<i>I even saw my last dying moment.</i>

01:46.731 --> 01:48.733
<i>Namyeong Station? You?</i>

01:49.317 --> 01:51.986
<i>You're that woman who saved my life?</i>

01:52.779 --> 01:57.200
<i>The girl who was in the accident with you</i>
<i>and died at the same time.</i>

01:58.118 --> 02:00.745
<i>You miraculously lived</i>
<i>on the same day I did.</i>

02:01.162 --> 02:03.081
<i>You die on the same day I do.</i>

02:03.832 --> 02:04.958
<i>What is this?</i>

02:05.667 --> 02:08.628
<i>You and I… what's our connection?</i>

02:16.886 --> 02:18.763
-What was that?
-What's this?

02:38.908 --> 02:39.742
Mom!

02:42.620 --> 02:44.122
Oh! No, no!

02:45.165 --> 02:46.124
Don't go!

02:49.419 --> 02:51.504
<i>That woman was you?</i>

02:53.089 --> 02:54.299
SONG MA-RIN

02:54.883 --> 02:57.302
<i>You miraculously lived</i>
<i>on the same day I did.</i>

02:58.887 --> 03:00.805
<i>You died on the same day I died.</i>

03:01.764 --> 03:03.224
<i>What is this?</i>

03:04.309 --> 03:07.145
<i>You and I… what's our connection?</i>

03:07.228 --> 03:08.062
Song Ma-rin.

03:09.022 --> 03:09.898
Let's talk.

03:09.981 --> 03:11.107
Who are you?

03:11.191 --> 03:13.276
-It won't take long. I'm sorry.
-Excuse me.

03:14.152 --> 03:15.320
My name...

03:17.530 --> 03:20.366
I am Yu So-joon.

03:22.327 --> 03:23.244
But...

03:24.996 --> 03:27.749
who are you?

03:36.299 --> 03:39.677
You appear out of nowhere
and ask me who I am?

03:41.095 --> 03:42.430
I know I seem strange.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.725
I know you may not understand,

03:46.517 --> 03:48.102
but I need to ask you something.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.814
I don't know what it is, but I don't care.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.399
I don't want to hear it.

03:54.901 --> 03:57.153
I have nothing to tell you.

03:57.487 --> 04:00.073
I don't want to say a single word to you.

04:00.156 --> 04:01.616
Are you really a survivor of

04:01.699 --> 04:03.701
the Namyeong accident
seven years ago?

04:04.160 --> 04:07.830
-Did you and a man on the subway--
-How did you know?

04:09.874 --> 04:11.292
I just did the interview today.

04:12.460 --> 04:14.337
The article couldn't be out already.

04:17.048 --> 04:18.091
So, it's true.

04:18.466 --> 04:19.676
How did you know?

04:19.759 --> 04:24.430
Were you planning to get off at Namyeong,
or was that by chance?

04:24.514 --> 04:27.058
I never told anyone. How did you know?

04:27.475 --> 04:29.644
Were you planning to get off,
or was it chance?

04:31.187 --> 04:32.438
It was by chance! Why?

04:33.564 --> 04:35.817
It was incredible luck
that I managed to live.

04:36.025 --> 04:37.110
Why are you asking?

04:42.365 --> 04:43.950
Why are you acting this way?

04:44.826 --> 04:47.370
I asked you already
how you knew about that!

04:53.209 --> 04:54.711
You are seriously weird.

04:59.090 --> 05:00.466
But, what do we do?

05:02.468 --> 05:03.428
We...

05:05.346 --> 05:07.348
have to continue meeting each other.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.989
Does he think I'll see him
just because he wants me to?

05:25.116 --> 05:26.868
How did he know about it anyway?

05:37.545 --> 05:38.796
Don't think about it.

05:42.550 --> 05:45.178
I will never fall for you,
no matter what you do.

05:46.721 --> 05:49.182
Don't look at me.
Don't look at me like that.

05:51.684 --> 05:53.102
NAMYEONG STATION ACCIDENT

06:03.780 --> 06:08.242
NAMYEONG SUBWAY STATION EXPLODES

06:14.874 --> 06:17.001
Namyeong Station accident.

06:17.585 --> 06:22.090
March 25, 2009.

06:24.008 --> 06:25.468
Me and Song Ma-rin.

06:26.594 --> 06:31.432
Our last day alive will be March 25, 2019.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.812
That's ten years.

06:36.938 --> 06:38.731
Ten years since the subway accident.

06:47.865 --> 06:49.617
I must be totally stupid.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.495
Why didn't I think of that?

06:54.038 --> 06:54.872
Wait.

06:56.791 --> 06:58.709
Why didn't that punk say anything?

06:59.377 --> 07:01.003
He must have known the entire time.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.966
That annoying little punk.

07:17.270 --> 07:21.858
MARCH 2019, FUTURE

07:39.041 --> 07:41.002
<i>I'm home. Don't come inside.</i>

07:42.795 --> 07:43.963
Why didn't you tell me?

07:45.047 --> 07:47.383
<i>About Song Ma-rin being</i>
<i>the woman from the accident?</i>

07:47.508 --> 07:51.179
<i>The day we die is ten years</i>
<i>after the day of the subway accident.</i>

07:51.679 --> 07:52.889
<i>Even the time is the same.</i>

07:53.014 --> 07:55.099
<i>They both occur at 9:15 p.m.</i>

07:55.933 --> 07:58.936
<i>Why didn't you say anything?</i>
<i>You knew everything, didn't you?</i>

07:59.645 --> 08:01.647
What would change if you knew?

08:02.940 --> 08:03.774
<i>What?</i>

08:04.609 --> 08:06.319
<i>Is this all just a coincidence?</i>

08:06.861 --> 08:08.154
<i>It's weird!</i>

08:08.571 --> 08:12.909
<i>You should have written in the journal,</i>
<i>or told Mister about it.</i>

08:14.785 --> 08:16.579
<i>Knowing won't change anything.</i>

08:17.788 --> 08:19.123
<i>That is my conclusion.</i>

08:19.665 --> 08:21.876
<i>Knowing about it...</i>

08:23.044 --> 08:24.504
<i>won't help you change anything.</i>

08:25.379 --> 08:28.716
If I know, why can't I change anything?
What is there that I can't change?

08:29.675 --> 08:32.428
<i>Is there... something else</i>
<i>that you're hiding?</i>

08:33.971 --> 08:35.056
Don't try so hard.

08:36.349 --> 08:37.642
It was useless in the end.

08:42.271 --> 08:44.398
Hey!

08:45.983 --> 08:48.110
Is this guy crazy or what?

08:49.195 --> 08:51.572
Gosh, I can't even go inside.

09:13.135 --> 09:16.180
It would be perfect
if we had just one more light.

09:17.265 --> 09:20.101
Couldn't we borrow one from the studio?

09:20.184 --> 09:22.603
You have to pay rent for all of these.

09:23.271 --> 09:26.148
What if we just carefully borrowed one?

09:26.482 --> 09:30.236
I read your article.
You're a survivor of Namyeong Station?

09:30.778 --> 09:32.655
Actually, I read it too.

09:32.905 --> 09:36.117
I wasn't sure if I should bring it up,
I was waiting to see.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.160
It's nothing to brag about.

09:38.536 --> 09:40.246
Ma-rin!

09:40.329 --> 09:44.375
Ma-rin!

09:44.458 --> 09:46.377
You're doing very well today!

09:46.460 --> 09:49.171
What in the world?
You were blessed with heaven's fortune.

09:49.255 --> 09:50.673
Did you read the article too?

09:51.007 --> 09:52.550
You look different to me now.

09:53.050 --> 09:56.137
I've only heard about miracles.
I never knew one was next to me.

09:56.220 --> 09:58.639
Ma-rin, the miracle.

09:58.723 --> 10:01.183
You're going
to bring Yu So-joon back, right?

10:01.684 --> 10:05.354
All the clothes So-joon wore are sold out.

10:06.939 --> 10:10.568
He said he'll study abroad, or emigrate--

10:10.651 --> 10:12.570
-That's nonsense!
-Hello.

10:12.820 --> 10:15.114
Everyone, stay where you are.

10:15.197 --> 10:18.534
All the items here will be seized,
so please comply.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.161
Seize? Seize what?

10:20.244 --> 10:21.579
-You can't!
-Take everything.

10:21.662 --> 10:23.789
-Don't touch that!
-Take those, too.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.249
Don't touch my clothes!

10:25.333 --> 10:27.376
I graduated from Ehwa Womans University.

10:27.460 --> 10:31.005
-Let go of me.
-Take them all. Here too.

10:31.589 --> 10:32.757
-Come here.
-No.

10:32.840 --> 10:35.760
-You call this hiding?
-I didn't do anything. Ma-rin!

10:35.843 --> 10:37.720
Come on out. Take her too.

10:37.803 --> 10:39.639
-I didn't do anything wrong.
-Hurry!

10:51.108 --> 10:51.942
Yes.

10:53.402 --> 10:54.779
Yes, I am Yu So-joon.

10:56.989 --> 10:57.948
The police station?

11:01.202 --> 11:02.078
What?

11:02.703 --> 11:06.457
What do you think you're doing?
I went to Ehwa Womans University.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.000
Isn't that on your screen?

11:08.334 --> 11:10.670
Yes. Congratulations on that.

11:10.753 --> 11:13.005
You went to Ehwa,
now you're in a police station.

11:13.172 --> 11:16.509
Stop saying useless things
and answer the questions, okay?

11:19.595 --> 11:22.682
Bap-soon, you're a well known face.

11:23.182 --> 11:24.600
Why would you do such a thing?

11:26.394 --> 11:30.106
I, myself, can't believe
I've committed a crime.

11:31.107 --> 11:34.652
I'm questioning you as a witness,
so you can relax and give your statement.

11:35.403 --> 11:38.864
The pictures had been printed
in mirror quality replica like all others.

11:39.073 --> 11:40.825
Did you do that yourself, Song Ma-rin?

11:42.201 --> 11:43.285
I am ashamed.

11:44.078 --> 11:46.831
-I have nothing to say.
-You have to answer.

11:47.790 --> 11:48.791
Did you do it?

11:49.041 --> 11:50.793
The concept was the same.

11:50.876 --> 11:53.754
If I don't stick to the concept requested,

11:53.921 --> 11:55.756
I wouldn't be able to make a living.

11:55.923 --> 11:58.509
I didn't know anything
about a trademark violation.

11:58.926 --> 12:00.511
-So, you did it.
-Yes.

12:00.594 --> 12:03.806
I'm here regarding
Yu So-joon's witness statement.

12:03.889 --> 12:05.057
-Over here.
-Yes, okay.

12:06.475 --> 12:07.393
Hello.

12:07.935 --> 12:11.355
He's actually the CEO of our company.

12:11.689 --> 12:13.733
This is our lawyer.

12:13.816 --> 12:17.069
Why did such a high-status man
model for a shopping mall?

12:17.737 --> 12:18.654
How odd.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.906
Yes, I really don't know either.

12:20.990 --> 12:23.284
Why don't you speak to our lawyer?

12:23.534 --> 12:25.411
-Sit over there.
-Okay.

12:26.328 --> 12:28.414
Thank you. Please be generous.

12:28.497 --> 12:32.543
Well, I'll confiscate
your memory card as evidence.

12:42.052 --> 12:43.596
Why are there reporters here?

12:43.804 --> 12:46.056
Is this that big of a deal?

12:46.140 --> 12:48.142
Why are they here?

12:48.225 --> 12:50.478
-I have more to ask you.
-I need a bathroom.

12:50.561 --> 12:51.645
Oh my!

12:54.106 --> 12:55.566
Are you-- are you all right?

12:59.904 --> 13:00.905
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

13:00.988 --> 13:02.948
Please don't tell him you saw Bap-soon.

13:03.032 --> 13:03.866
What?

13:04.116 --> 13:06.577
To your boss, Yu So-joon.

13:06.994 --> 13:10.122
Don't tell him you saw me here.
Please. It's a national secret.

13:10.539 --> 13:11.624
Na-- national...

13:18.255 --> 13:19.340
What is this?

13:19.632 --> 13:21.675
-You're actually home?
-Oh my!

13:21.759 --> 13:23.469
I didn't say you could come in.

13:23.552 --> 13:25.387
-Come on. Show me your place.
-No!

13:25.471 --> 13:26.514
Ouch!

13:26.889 --> 13:27.807
Go. Go on.

13:27.890 --> 13:30.100
-Don't you have any manners?
-No.

13:30.184 --> 13:31.060
Jeez.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.648
What? What do you want now?

13:37.775 --> 13:39.109
I see.

13:40.402 --> 13:44.240
I did think
you two had an incredible fate.

13:44.865 --> 13:47.243
You were survivors of the same accident.

13:47.451 --> 13:51.121
The future me seems to know something,
but he's hiding it.

13:51.539 --> 13:54.166
Oh, my head hurts.

13:54.291 --> 13:56.418
-Do you have a headache?
-Yes.

13:56.836 --> 14:00.589
I was traveling back and forth
so much on the subway.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.801
I was confused about whether
this was the present or the past.

14:03.884 --> 14:06.178
Am I the real me
or was the future me the real me?

14:06.262 --> 14:08.222
My head started to hurt.

14:09.181 --> 14:11.350
I started to get headaches
so I took medicine.

14:11.433 --> 14:13.519
Then my stomach got bad,
so I took medicine.

14:13.602 --> 14:16.522
I took so much medication
that my liver needed to be cleansed.

14:16.605 --> 14:18.941
Now I'm taking liver medicine.
I'm on so many pills.

14:19.024 --> 14:20.192
When I talk, my breath...

14:20.860 --> 14:22.194
It really smells bad.

14:22.319 --> 14:23.737
I haven't brushed my teeth yet.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.490
I think our lives are so hard.

14:26.907 --> 14:30.703
Make some friends,
instead of talking to me all the time.

14:31.328 --> 14:34.331
I am talking about the truth here.

14:34.415 --> 14:35.541
What truth?

14:35.624 --> 14:37.835
I can't even organize things for myself.

14:38.210 --> 14:42.673
How can we understand
the world we live in?

14:42.798 --> 14:47.720
Right now you're saying
you don't know either.

14:47.803 --> 14:52.600
I'm not saying I don't know.
I was saying that I can predict.

14:53.350 --> 14:54.310
Who am I?

14:54.977 --> 14:57.688
-It's me.
-What "me?"

14:58.856 --> 15:01.609
Incredible insight and mind.

15:01.692 --> 15:02.943
An elegant wisdom.

15:05.529 --> 15:06.822
Have a child.

15:12.036 --> 15:12.912
What?

15:12.995 --> 15:14.997
Two people who avoided
the same accident die

15:15.080 --> 15:17.166
ten years later on the same day and time.

15:17.249 --> 15:19.001
What do you think this means?

15:19.084 --> 15:22.171
You two were destined to die then,
so death came back for you.

15:22.254 --> 15:24.089
"You got away back then?"

15:24.173 --> 15:26.800
"That won't do.
I'll come back for you ten years later."

15:28.302 --> 15:29.553
You know how it is.

15:29.678 --> 15:31.180
We go and see the future.

15:31.263 --> 15:34.516
What is the one thing we can't change?

15:35.059 --> 15:36.977
A person being born and dying.

15:37.186 --> 15:38.312
Right?

15:39.396 --> 15:41.774
Only I can think of these things.

15:43.734 --> 15:45.986
Are you having fun? Is this exciting?

15:46.987 --> 15:48.697
Look at your face.

15:49.448 --> 15:50.824
I'm leaving.

15:52.660 --> 15:56.372
I have seen someone avoid
their fate of death just once.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.084
She was such a pretty young lady.

16:01.126 --> 16:03.253
She was supposed to die in a car accident.

16:03.754 --> 16:06.131
I wanted to help her,
so I tried everything.

16:06.465 --> 16:07.925
I couldn't change it.

16:08.342 --> 16:10.386
So, I told her to date.

16:10.761 --> 16:13.514
I got her to connect with a guy
that wasn't planned.

16:14.056 --> 16:16.809
These two found a new world,

16:16.892 --> 16:19.144
so they did it day and night.

16:19.937 --> 16:21.563
Then they had a child.

16:21.647 --> 16:23.190
An unexpected life.

16:23.273 --> 16:24.108
Then what?

16:24.358 --> 16:26.986
So, they're living really well.

16:27.069 --> 16:29.029
They have a second and third child.

16:29.113 --> 16:30.990
What kind of lie is this extensive?

16:31.490 --> 16:33.617
-What?
-You saved a life?

16:33.867 --> 16:36.161
Someone like you, who is so lazy?

16:37.955 --> 16:38.998
She was my daughter.

16:44.128 --> 16:45.337
She was my daughter.

16:47.464 --> 16:50.009
-Really?
-An unexpected life...

16:51.260 --> 16:54.555
changed the fate of death.
That's what I think.

17:04.231 --> 17:06.066
So, you have a family?

17:14.950 --> 17:16.452
So, what you're saying is...

17:17.661 --> 17:19.329
If I want to live,

17:19.663 --> 17:22.541
marry Song Ma-rin and have babies?

17:22.624 --> 17:23.792
Have a child.

17:24.960 --> 17:27.838
You would completely shatter your fate.

17:31.175 --> 17:32.259
Look here.

17:32.468 --> 17:33.302
What is it?

17:33.385 --> 17:34.887
-Mister.
-What?

17:34.970 --> 17:37.973
You shouldn't speak so carelessly
just because it's not your life.

17:38.057 --> 17:41.185
-I've thought about this very carefully.
-Really?

17:41.894 --> 17:43.270
I just don't know anymore!

17:45.189 --> 17:48.525
Then you should have let her die.
Why did you save her?

17:49.651 --> 17:52.696
I assumed you had some feelings for her.

17:58.994 --> 17:59.912
Jeez.

18:01.205 --> 18:02.623
It's raining!

18:03.082 --> 18:04.208
It stopped!

18:04.708 --> 18:06.752
Don't drop honorifics, kid!

18:09.004 --> 18:12.466
EVIDENCE #5

18:16.428 --> 18:18.430
BAP-SOON, A SURVIVOR OF
THE NAMYEONG ACCIDENT

18:20.307 --> 18:23.393
I was hoping to improve my image
after 25 years.

18:27.439 --> 18:31.110
<i>Song Ma-rin, you should forget</i>
<i>about Bap-soon now.</i>

18:31.693 --> 18:35.030
<i>Live out your life as Song Ma-rin now.</i>

18:37.157 --> 18:39.493
Song Ma-rin, aren't you coming out?

18:39.576 --> 18:41.203
It's been over 30 minutes.

18:41.495 --> 18:46.125
<i>Also, I hope</i>
<i>Bap-soon articles stop being published.</i>

18:47.709 --> 18:49.211
Song Ma-rin!

18:51.588 --> 18:53.799
I have my reasons
for being unable to leave.

18:53.882 --> 18:54.967
I told you already.

18:55.217 --> 18:57.553
I have irritable bowel syndrome.

18:58.929 --> 19:00.139
Still,

19:00.597 --> 19:02.432
you should be

19:03.016 --> 19:04.935
done by now!

19:05.018 --> 19:07.771
I will exercise my right to remain silent.

19:07.938 --> 19:10.440
I feel so shameful
having this conversation.

19:10.816 --> 19:13.068
Please just come out, would you?

19:13.777 --> 19:17.948
<i>We should no longer take an interest</i>
<i>in Song Ma-rin's affairs.</i>

19:18.031 --> 19:19.366
<i>I think that would be polite.</i>

19:19.616 --> 19:22.494
<i>Articles about Song Ma-rin</i>
<i>should no longer be written or read.</i>

19:24.079 --> 19:26.540
You should not be playing around
at a police station!

19:26.623 --> 19:28.834
I can't go out because of the reporters.

19:47.102 --> 19:51.148
Oh, our shopping mall model is home.

19:52.441 --> 19:54.985
Don't talk about it.
I don't want to be bothered.

19:55.694 --> 19:58.238
Do you know how much people are talking?

19:58.322 --> 20:01.116
Saying you don't show up,
but now you're a blatant punk.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.326
Who called me a punk?

20:02.409 --> 20:03.577
I'm the CEO.

20:04.745 --> 20:06.788
I saw Bap-soon
at the police station today.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.627
She told me not to tell you I saw her.

20:13.086 --> 20:16.340
I want to take an interest in you...

20:17.758 --> 20:20.135
but I'm getting curious
about what you've been up to.

20:22.012 --> 20:22.930
Drink this.

20:25.807 --> 20:27.142
Do you want cold noodles?

20:27.226 --> 20:28.227
-Should we?
-Yes.

20:28.310 --> 20:29.144
Maybe not.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.104
You have to.
It's minimum two servings.

20:31.438 --> 20:33.440
That's the only way they'll deliver!

20:34.441 --> 20:35.400
Order two.

20:42.741 --> 20:46.036
Others travel thanks to their children,
I get to tour a police station.

20:46.161 --> 20:48.163
My life is so different
than that of others.

20:49.206 --> 20:50.207
Thank you so much.

20:50.332 --> 20:53.794
Every time I see the news,
I can say that I've been there.

20:54.211 --> 20:55.212
I heard enough.

20:55.712 --> 20:56.672
Look at So-ri.

20:57.089 --> 21:01.051
She's so effortlessly calm.
Running a piano academy. What a nice girl!

21:01.134 --> 21:03.303
Why are you dragging me into this?

21:03.387 --> 21:06.098
I'm behind on my academy rent,
I'm about to be kicked out.

21:06.181 --> 21:07.099
Kicked out?

21:08.058 --> 21:11.353
How mortifying is this going to be
once people find out about you?

21:11.603 --> 21:13.689
No one will know if you keep quiet.

21:15.023 --> 21:16.483
As long you don't spread rumors,

21:16.566 --> 21:20.570
no one will know your daughter is Bap-soon
or care what I'm up to.

21:22.239 --> 21:23.282
Where are you going?

21:23.365 --> 21:25.450
Ma-rin was a victim too.

21:25.534 --> 21:26.785
Don't be so hard on her.

21:27.661 --> 21:29.830
You nag her a bit too much.

21:30.872 --> 21:31.915
Gosh.

21:32.457 --> 21:35.168
You're her friend.
You should try to help her.

21:36.336 --> 21:37.462
Do you have a boyfriend?

21:37.587 --> 21:38.422
No.

21:38.505 --> 21:40.799
See, I knew you wouldn't.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.718
Go out and meet some men.

21:43.010 --> 21:46.013
You'll just age while hanging out
with your friends.

21:46.096 --> 21:47.222
What will you gain?

21:48.223 --> 21:51.101
Goodness, you don't know
what the world is like.

21:51.184 --> 21:52.686
So frustrating.

22:17.252 --> 22:18.170
Are you okay?

22:19.463 --> 22:21.173
You should've looked into it.

22:21.757 --> 22:24.551
She said she'd only hire you
if you brought me.

22:24.926 --> 22:26.303
I thought that was strange.

22:28.388 --> 22:31.141
Yeah, I didn't realize
it was a place like that.

22:31.224 --> 22:33.393
I'm sorry that you had to deal with that.

22:34.770 --> 22:36.521
Sorry. Are you satisfied?

22:37.314 --> 22:38.565
How about we make up?

22:40.484 --> 22:41.360
What?

22:42.152 --> 22:43.445
Let's make up.

22:44.321 --> 22:45.739
That's what I came here to say.

22:48.116 --> 22:50.369
Thanks for coming all this way.

22:51.244 --> 22:54.289
But I don't know
why I have to make up with you.

22:54.873 --> 22:56.792
Don't be so sarcastic.

22:58.460 --> 23:00.587
Honestly, it wasn't such a big deal.

23:03.840 --> 23:05.175
It wasn't.

23:06.051 --> 23:09.012
You came and went whenever you pleased.

23:09.471 --> 23:11.473
I ended up getting embarrassed
a few times.

23:11.890 --> 23:13.767
Is there anything to make up over?

23:16.144 --> 23:18.438
I don't understand,
no matter how much I try.

23:19.564 --> 23:21.274
Why are you acting so strange to me?

23:21.900 --> 23:24.986
We have no special relationship.
What were we?

23:27.614 --> 23:30.909
I don't know what we are.

23:32.828 --> 23:34.996
I'm so confused
that my head's going to explode.

23:36.331 --> 23:37.165
Yeah.

23:38.625 --> 23:40.377
I just wanted to settle things.

23:41.461 --> 23:44.047
My heart didn't feel at ease about it.

23:50.429 --> 23:52.347
"I'd like it if we had no contact."

23:53.473 --> 23:54.808
"Or run into each other."

23:57.185 --> 23:58.270
"Let's end it here."

24:00.105 --> 24:01.690
That's what you said.

24:02.357 --> 24:04.025
I'm telling you in case you forgot.

24:05.277 --> 24:06.987
That's what you thought of me.

24:14.202 --> 24:15.787
We didn't have a relationship.

24:17.038 --> 24:20.375
Do you really think I was fine
all this time?

24:36.308 --> 24:39.728
Does he think I'll come when he calls
and leave when he says?

24:40.228 --> 24:41.730
Who does he think he is?

24:52.449 --> 24:54.034
What do I do about this?

24:59.498 --> 25:02.876
<i>Why don't you try looking for that girl?</i>

25:05.337 --> 25:09.633
The girl who was in the accident with you
and died at the same time.

25:17.349 --> 25:18.892
<i>That was your original future.</i>

25:20.393 --> 25:22.103
<i>You would be hurt and soon after...</i>

25:22.979 --> 25:25.398
<i>you were destined to die,</i>
<i>and I felt bad for you.</i>

25:29.486 --> 25:31.321
<i>That's why I helped you.</i>

25:43.250 --> 25:44.167
Se-young.

25:45.001 --> 25:46.127
Why are you out here?

25:46.211 --> 25:48.338
I'm so embarrassed I could die. Go inside.

25:48.547 --> 25:50.882
I can imagine what your dad is doing.

25:54.511 --> 25:55.845
Hello there.

25:56.054 --> 25:59.849
I want to share the hope
that Happiness is spreading.

26:02.394 --> 26:04.938
These houses are very pretty, aren't they?

26:05.021 --> 26:09.442
These are all built
by Happiness Construction.

26:10.986 --> 26:13.947
Donate the money you spend
on drinking just once.

26:14.322 --> 26:16.283
For the families
that are living separately,

26:16.366 --> 26:18.702
and those that cannot settle,

26:18.785 --> 26:24.124
we can provide safe, stable,
and happy homes.

26:24.499 --> 26:26.459
Mister, let's go. Se-young is waiting.

26:26.543 --> 26:28.211
It's So-joon.

26:29.546 --> 26:30.422
Chairman Yu.

26:30.755 --> 26:32.215
What are you doing?

26:32.299 --> 26:35.468
Look at him. He looks young.

26:35.552 --> 26:39.639
-He donates the most to Happiness.
-Hello!

26:39.723 --> 26:41.850
Mister, this doesn't suit you.

26:41.933 --> 26:44.060
You're the board director of an NGO.

26:44.144 --> 26:46.563
-So what?
-Let's go.

26:46.646 --> 26:48.148
So what?

26:49.649 --> 26:50.859
I'm proud of you.

26:52.152 --> 26:53.862
If your parents saw you...

26:54.946 --> 26:57.574
how proud they would be of you.

26:59.618 --> 27:02.203
-You adorable thing.
-I'm driving.

27:02.287 --> 27:03.580
Dad, give it a rest.

27:04.122 --> 27:05.790
You're always saying the same thing.

27:06.249 --> 27:10.837
Change your repertoire, quit drinking,
or don't call us out.

27:11.588 --> 27:17.010
It was their dream to make
a charity foundation in their lifetime.

27:17.927 --> 27:20.805
Their son achieved it all.

27:20.889 --> 27:23.725
If you keep talking about it,
I'll stop supporting it.

27:26.102 --> 27:27.979
It's been seven years now.

27:29.314 --> 27:31.232
You can think about the good memories now.

27:32.317 --> 27:36.488
What a relief it was that you lived.

27:40.367 --> 27:42.369
Please understand. Dad's drunk.

27:46.414 --> 27:48.041
The Namyeong Station accident...

27:49.084 --> 27:50.669
try to make peace with it.

27:51.086 --> 27:52.671
Be cool with it.

27:52.879 --> 27:54.214
I don't have peace with it.

27:55.465 --> 27:58.134
It's not something I can make peace with.

27:59.260 --> 28:01.096
I won't have peace even when I die.

28:01.513 --> 28:03.056
I don't even want it.

28:05.183 --> 28:08.520
So, please stop talking about it.

28:11.564 --> 28:12.482
All right.

28:19.781 --> 28:21.366
Should I put on some music?

28:22.158 --> 28:23.243
Let's listen to music.

28:30.417 --> 28:33.878
<i>I don't know what we are.</i>

28:34.796 --> 28:37.048
<i>I'm so confused</i>
<i>that my head's going to explode.</i>

28:37.424 --> 28:39.092
<i>I just wanted to settle things.</i>

28:39.259 --> 28:40.760
<i>My heart didn't feel at ease.</i>

28:41.886 --> 28:44.013
Why would his head explode because of me?

28:45.974 --> 28:47.308
I shouldn't fall for it.

28:47.934 --> 28:49.310
Stay alert.

28:51.354 --> 28:53.690
I'm not such an easy woman.

29:07.245 --> 29:11.624
Should I buy a used one, or borrow one?

29:26.639 --> 29:27.724
Just wait.

29:28.475 --> 29:29.768
You'll be mine soon.

29:30.602 --> 29:31.436
I mean..

29:32.437 --> 29:34.856
you will be mine someday for sure.

29:45.700 --> 29:47.535
Aren't you on your honeymoon?

29:49.329 --> 29:50.997
Can't you hear the ocean waves?

29:52.123 --> 29:53.374
<i>Maybe I can.</i>

29:53.625 --> 29:58.254
This must be why people say
you have to go to Hawaii all the time.

29:58.379 --> 30:00.590
It's so nice. It really is.

30:03.301 --> 30:06.262
I'm planning on visiting
once or twice a year.

30:06.721 --> 30:09.641
<i>Yeah, it must be great</i>
<i>to be there on your honeymoon.</i>

30:10.141 --> 30:11.726
<i>But, what time is it there?</i>

30:12.769 --> 30:14.604
I called to suit your time in Korea.

30:15.980 --> 30:21.194
Being here in such a great place
made<i> </i>me think of my friends.

30:21.778 --> 30:22.612
<i>Gun-sook.</i>

30:23.655 --> 30:26.241
Now that you have lots of money,
can you lend me some?

30:27.700 --> 30:28.660
I'm hanging up.

30:32.622 --> 30:35.375
Are you leaving even after seeing me
acting so pathetically?

30:36.626 --> 30:38.920
They would have assumed
you were on your honeymoon.

30:39.295 --> 30:40.463
Why bother calling?

30:42.841 --> 30:45.093
This is fraud, no matter how I see it.

30:45.468 --> 30:48.596
How could you cancel the honeymoon
as soon as the wedding ended?

30:49.973 --> 30:53.184
Do you know how many investors
I can meet in one week?

30:53.309 --> 30:55.353
They are all hidden sources of money.

30:55.812 --> 30:56.813
I told you already.

30:57.146 --> 31:01.234
Right now, I need to push forward
for your sake and mine.

31:01.776 --> 31:04.070
That alone will keep me busy.

31:05.405 --> 31:08.825
You think this will make up
for my once in a lifetime hon-moon?

31:08.908 --> 31:10.743
"Hon-moon"? Don't say it that way.

31:11.494 --> 31:12.912
Say it after me, honeymoon.

31:14.205 --> 31:15.540
-Honeymoon.
-One more time.

31:16.207 --> 31:17.250
Honeymoon!

31:17.500 --> 31:18.334
That's good.

31:18.585 --> 31:20.837
Don't shorten words like kids do.
You look cheap.

31:22.297 --> 31:25.842
Fine! Let's see how great this is.

31:28.553 --> 31:30.263
AMERICAN EXPRESS VVIP

31:31.598 --> 31:32.473
Do you like it?

31:34.726 --> 31:36.436
Use it for living costs or whatever.

31:36.644 --> 31:38.646
You're the owner of the house,
Lee Gun-sook.

31:40.815 --> 31:43.902
This replaces Hawaii?

31:45.111 --> 31:47.822
You would be very upset
if that was all you got for Hawaii.

31:48.072 --> 31:49.490
Isn't that right, Lee Gun-sook?

31:50.325 --> 31:53.953
You did marry me. I'll have people
call you "Chairman's Wife."

31:54.704 --> 31:57.290
Okay? Have a nice morning. Bye.

31:57.957 --> 31:59.042
"Chairman's Wife"?

32:01.628 --> 32:02.503
Chairman?

32:07.425 --> 32:08.801
<i>Have a child.</i>

32:09.928 --> 32:11.012
<i>Have a child.</i>

32:12.472 --> 32:13.806
Have a child.

32:15.725 --> 32:17.018
Have a child.

32:18.561 --> 32:20.939
What are you even thinking?

32:22.482 --> 32:24.400
Hey, Yu So-joon.

32:24.484 --> 32:25.401
Are you crazy?

32:25.777 --> 32:27.487
Are you this low?

32:33.076 --> 32:34.702
<i>Give me rice.</i>

32:36.663 --> 32:38.414
Give me rice.

32:41.501 --> 32:42.669
Realtor.

32:42.752 --> 32:43.878
Give me rice.

32:43.962 --> 32:46.547
-Realtor!
-Give me rice.

32:46.673 --> 32:47.840
Realtor.

32:47.924 --> 32:49.175
Give me rice.

32:49.258 --> 32:51.052
-Realtor.
-Give me rice.

32:51.135 --> 32:53.471
-Realtor.
-Give me rice.

32:53.554 --> 32:56.265
-Realtor.
-Give me rice.

32:56.349 --> 32:58.726
-Realtor.
-Give me rice.

32:58.810 --> 33:00.395
Realtor.

33:00.478 --> 33:02.647
-Realtor.
-Give me rice.

33:02.730 --> 33:03.856
Realtor.

33:03.940 --> 33:05.066
Give me rice.

33:05.149 --> 33:06.901
Realtor.

33:26.087 --> 33:27.630
This is everything I have.

33:28.381 --> 33:30.174
Sorry I can't help you out more.

33:30.842 --> 33:32.760
Oh my. Thank you, So-ri.

33:33.761 --> 33:37.015
I'll submit my resume everywhere
and repay you with interest.

33:40.601 --> 33:43.563
You said that guy owns
a real estate agency.

33:43.980 --> 33:47.316
-Isn't he richer than I am?
-What does that have to do with me?

33:47.400 --> 33:50.653
He came to your house twice.
Looks like love to me.

33:51.988 --> 33:54.157
I was hung up on that point too.

33:55.033 --> 33:55.908
But no.

33:56.325 --> 33:57.994
You don't know who Realtor is.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.913
He is very rich.

34:02.623 --> 34:05.501
Anyway, there is no way
he would really like me.

34:06.085 --> 34:07.670
I think he's just kind of crazy.

34:07.754 --> 34:09.756
Crazy is okay
if his agency is big.

34:12.216 --> 34:13.843
You sound just like Gun-sook.

34:15.928 --> 34:20.183
I had money and fame when I was six.
It's all useless.

34:20.725 --> 34:22.268
You spend what you can afford.

34:22.602 --> 34:25.438
If you get caught up in these things,
your life is meaningless.

34:28.191 --> 34:29.025
It's him.

34:29.609 --> 34:31.069
REALTOR

34:34.822 --> 34:38.159
-Why? Get it. I'm curious.
-No.

34:39.410 --> 34:41.496
How dare you call me!

34:42.330 --> 34:43.664
I won't even look.

34:44.165 --> 34:45.708
Where are you going?

34:45.792 --> 34:47.168
I can't fall for this.

34:54.300 --> 34:55.176
Where are you?

34:55.343 --> 34:57.136
<i>I'm a friend of Ma-rin's.</i>

34:58.888 --> 35:00.473
Ah, hello.

35:00.890 --> 35:03.476
If you want to see Ma-rin,

35:03.768 --> 35:07.230
come to So-ri Piano Academy in Oksu-dong.

35:07.980 --> 35:10.650
I will be waiting breathlessly!

35:33.756 --> 35:39.387
-Ma'am.
-Ma'am!

35:39.512 --> 35:40.388
Kids!

35:40.513 --> 35:42.390
-Ma'am.
-Ma'am!

35:42.473 --> 35:43.516
Don't call me Ma'am.

35:43.599 --> 35:44.767
Call me Sis! Try!

35:44.851 --> 35:48.521
-Okay, Ma'am!
-Ma'am!

35:48.688 --> 35:50.022
Ma'am!

35:52.692 --> 35:54.902
<i>Aren't you too casual?</i>
<i>We don't know each other.</i>

35:55.153 --> 35:56.487
<i>Have a child.</i>

35:57.155 --> 35:58.906
<i>An unexpected life...</i>

36:00.116 --> 36:02.410
Dad!

36:02.493 --> 36:03.703
Dad!

36:10.042 --> 36:11.544
Go. Go home now.<i> </i>

36:11.627 --> 36:12.628
Good!

36:12.712 --> 36:14.088
Let's go!

36:16.966 --> 36:18.634
How did you know I was here?

36:19.468 --> 36:21.679
I guess I shouldn't have come.

36:22.471 --> 36:23.598
Are you following me?

36:23.681 --> 36:26.434
Following you? Your friend told me to...

36:27.018 --> 36:28.227
I told him to come.

36:28.311 --> 36:29.395
You hear that?

36:32.315 --> 36:33.149
Follow me.

36:33.608 --> 36:34.442
Let's eat.

36:36.110 --> 36:37.528
-Bye.
-Good bye.

36:42.491 --> 36:44.577
I've seen him before. Where was it?

36:46.913 --> 36:48.539
Gun-sook's wedding.

36:48.956 --> 36:50.166
Oh my, that chairman?

36:55.296 --> 36:56.255
You're eating well.

36:56.923 --> 36:58.257
What are you looking at?

36:59.508 --> 37:01.260
What do you mean? Eat up.

37:03.179 --> 37:06.390
Even if my friend told you to,
it's a bit strange of you to come.

37:07.225 --> 37:10.102
It must be a disease
for someone to be so fickle.

37:10.853 --> 37:13.689
Seeing you yell last time,
you have anger issues too.

37:14.607 --> 37:16.943
-Are you bipolar?
-Should we go to the hospital?

37:17.276 --> 37:19.654
I think you could do
with a psychiatric assessment.

37:20.905 --> 37:22.657
By any chance...

37:23.783 --> 37:26.869
is there a feud within your company
over power, or between heirs?

37:27.036 --> 37:29.038
You know, those things you see
in TV dramas?

37:29.664 --> 37:31.207
You don't even seem to work hard.

37:31.290 --> 37:34.126
Are you fighting dirty
to keep your chairman spot?

37:35.795 --> 37:37.505
Are you going through those things?

37:38.422 --> 37:40.174
Maybe you're very stressed?

37:42.051 --> 37:44.971
How did you know?
That's exactly my state lately.

37:46.639 --> 37:47.598
No wonder...

37:48.516 --> 37:50.977
-That explains it.
-Do you think that's the only reason

37:51.602 --> 37:52.812
I'm so confused?

37:52.937 --> 37:55.564
By any chance, is your mother, no...

37:56.190 --> 37:57.650
One should not go after family.

37:57.858 --> 38:00.027
It's okay in my world.

38:00.778 --> 38:04.615
There's not much affection in families.
Ambition is stronger than blood.

38:05.783 --> 38:06.701
I see.

38:07.952 --> 38:09.537
Then has your mother thrown

38:09.704 --> 38:12.540
water at your ex-girlfriends
and given them money to stay away?

38:13.624 --> 38:16.836
I don't... want to talk about that.

38:22.049 --> 38:23.259
I can see why you're lost.

38:23.801 --> 38:25.636
So, you're lost right now.

38:28.973 --> 38:30.474
You shouldn't lose laughter.

38:31.350 --> 38:34.312
Still, how should I put it?

38:34.770 --> 38:38.190
You seem less dirty
than the people of that world.

38:39.358 --> 38:41.068
You have a human side.

38:41.360 --> 38:42.194
Thanks.

38:42.278 --> 38:44.947
So you pay for the udon noodles.

38:46.574 --> 38:49.577
-What's this? Where are you going?
-My curiosity is satisfied.

38:51.329 --> 38:52.580
You're just leaving?

38:55.333 --> 38:56.292
As I thought,

38:56.375 --> 38:59.712
-when something's off, there's a reason.
-Song Ma-rin!

39:00.254 --> 39:03.299
You're just going to leave?
I came all this way.

39:04.175 --> 39:07.178
That's why I forgive what you did to me.

39:07.470 --> 39:09.180
So come to your senses.

39:09.972 --> 39:12.266
I hope you become
a contributing member of society.

39:12.892 --> 39:14.393
-I'm not done talking.
-Oh, my!

39:16.562 --> 39:17.730
My pictures.

39:18.522 --> 39:19.523
You should be careful.

39:19.732 --> 39:20.691
I'm sorry.

39:23.611 --> 39:26.238
Please don't step on it.
It's a person's face.

39:26.322 --> 39:27.323
Watch out.

39:27.865 --> 39:29.158
Don't miss a single one.

39:30.159 --> 39:32.453
I don't want my face
rolling around on the street.

39:32.620 --> 39:33.454
Okay.

39:39.168 --> 39:41.295
Why so many pictures?
Are they for resumes?

39:41.921 --> 39:42.922
None of your business.

39:49.387 --> 39:50.554
Gosh.

39:52.056 --> 39:54.308
I read the article
about you and Namyeong Station.

39:57.853 --> 39:59.563
Do you remember the person?

40:00.606 --> 40:04.652
The person who miraculously survived
with you?

40:06.445 --> 40:07.905
-Why do you ask?
-Just because.

40:08.948 --> 40:10.449
I was curious when I read it.

40:12.118 --> 40:15.413
No, things were so hectic then.

40:16.288 --> 40:17.665
I hope he is living well.

40:18.916 --> 40:22.420
He was so lucky to survive.
I'm sure he's living very well.

40:24.088 --> 40:25.631
I would be relieved if he were,

40:25.714 --> 40:27.383
but it's not so easy to do.

40:29.176 --> 40:30.636
I hope he's not feeling guilty.

40:33.848 --> 40:34.723
Guilt?

40:35.766 --> 40:37.226
You wouldn't understand.

40:38.227 --> 40:40.938
People say it's a relief
that you survived.

40:41.480 --> 40:43.774
They don't know how guilty
that makes me feel.

40:46.277 --> 40:50.239
It would be nice to meet him once,
so that we could console each other.

40:53.826 --> 40:54.827
Console him how?

40:57.121 --> 40:58.789
Do I have to tell you that?

40:59.790 --> 41:02.126
I'll tell him myself if I ever meet him.

41:09.758 --> 41:10.676
What are you doing?

41:11.552 --> 41:13.220
Why are you staring at my picture?

41:18.100 --> 41:21.145
And you knew before the article came out.

41:21.395 --> 41:22.563
About my accident...

41:23.731 --> 41:24.899
How did you know?

41:24.982 --> 41:29.236
Didn't I tell you about my family?
My third secretary told me about you.

41:29.820 --> 41:31.530
What did we do?

41:31.614 --> 41:32.865
Do your parents know?

41:33.616 --> 41:34.533
Are they...

41:36.327 --> 41:37.620
Are they watching?

41:37.786 --> 41:39.079
Don't overreact.

41:43.209 --> 41:44.460
I'm going to keep one.

41:44.543 --> 41:45.878
No. Hey.

41:46.712 --> 41:47.796
Why would you...

41:48.380 --> 41:50.049
What are you doing?

41:50.925 --> 41:52.009
What are you doing?

41:52.092 --> 41:54.011
Why would you keep my picture? Hey.

41:54.762 --> 41:56.889
I'm going to take it home
and have a good look.

41:57.556 --> 41:58.557
At what?

41:59.099 --> 42:00.142
Your face.

42:01.936 --> 42:03.145
What you look like.

42:03.479 --> 42:06.649
You look... kind of cute.

42:14.073 --> 42:16.200
BAR

42:16.325 --> 42:17.159
Hey!

42:17.910 --> 42:19.286
Slaves to your cell phones.

42:19.995 --> 42:21.747
Why did you call me?

42:21.830 --> 42:23.332
I came because Ki-doong called.

42:24.333 --> 42:27.628
-Hey. Talking is important.
-Hey, I was doing something.

42:28.921 --> 42:31.215
It's just that my mind is not clear.

42:31.298 --> 42:32.216
Why?

42:32.299 --> 42:33.425
Give me a drink.

42:34.677 --> 42:38.889
Suppose that I...
This is strictly a hypothetical situation.

42:40.349 --> 42:45.479
What do you think
about me getting married?

42:45.563 --> 42:46.647
I'd feel sorry for her.

42:46.730 --> 42:49.108
Who can live with someone
who only thinks of himself?

42:49.233 --> 42:50.401
That's not true.

42:50.943 --> 42:52.027
Meet someone first.

42:53.028 --> 42:55.030
I've never thought
about marriage before.

42:55.114 --> 42:57.157
Then don't get married.

42:57.241 --> 43:00.160
Yeah, it's not like you'll die
if you don't get married.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.502
Hey, give me that thing I asked for.

43:08.586 --> 43:09.461
Yeah, okay.

43:09.920 --> 43:12.881
This camera is for professionals.
Why do you need it?

43:15.593 --> 43:16.468
Eat up. Bye!

43:17.052 --> 43:18.012
Where are you going?

43:18.095 --> 43:19.555
-Don't forget your phone.
-Right.

43:19.680 --> 43:21.348
Pick up when I call.

43:22.766 --> 43:26.145
-Is something going on with him?
-I don't know.

43:28.647 --> 43:29.940
Is he really dating someone?

43:30.482 --> 43:31.442
I don't know.

43:33.068 --> 43:34.403
What do you know?

43:34.862 --> 43:35.946
I don't know.

43:39.366 --> 43:40.659
<i>Do you remember the person?</i>

43:41.827 --> 43:45.873
<i>The person who miraculously survived</i>
<i>with you?</i>

43:53.339 --> 43:55.257
<i>Because I survived that accident...</i>

43:56.800 --> 44:01.305
<i>I still get congratulated by people,</i>
<i>even seven years later.</i>

44:03.932 --> 44:04.892
I'm sorry.

44:38.300 --> 44:39.677
Did the heavens give it to me?

44:40.636 --> 44:41.637
What is this?

44:46.684 --> 44:47.518
<i>Present.</i>

44:54.149 --> 44:57.403
Did you look into whether it's okay
to buy more land in Sobeol district?

44:57.569 --> 45:00.114
-No.
-I told you, ages ago.

45:02.074 --> 45:04.451
The chairman needs to sign

45:04.535 --> 45:07.079
for the investment director
to make a move.

45:07.162 --> 45:08.872
All right!

45:08.956 --> 45:11.417
Can't you see that I'm working?

45:12.084 --> 45:13.752
-What is that?
-A cow.

45:18.298 --> 45:19.341
Are you insane?

45:19.508 --> 45:22.010
<i>Thank you for the camera,</i>
<i>but it's burdensome.</i>

45:22.094 --> 45:23.887
<i>I'll return it to you.</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>

45:23.971 --> 45:25.764
Did you draw a cow's head on the map?

45:25.889 --> 45:26.724
<i>I'm at work.</i>

45:26.807 --> 45:29.101
<i>It's a small gift</i>
<i>from the son of a rich family.</i>

45:29.184 --> 45:31.645
<i>Just accept it.</i>
<i>What has the camera done wrong?</i>

45:32.688 --> 45:33.522
You!

45:33.605 --> 45:36.108
I think I worked much too hard today.

45:36.483 --> 45:38.193
Oh. And...

45:38.777 --> 45:41.947
Will L Group relocate to Sobeol district?

45:42.030 --> 45:43.490
That's the point, isn't it?

45:43.741 --> 45:44.616
Manager Kang.

46:07.556 --> 46:09.308
Maybe the camera's done nothing wrong.

46:15.773 --> 46:18.442
It has done something wrong.
It's too expensive.

46:18.776 --> 46:20.235
The camera is guilty.

46:27.242 --> 46:29.328
Do his parents own this entire building?

46:35.125 --> 46:36.210
Yu So-joon.

46:37.127 --> 46:38.462
Hey.

46:41.507 --> 46:42.341
Hey.

46:45.135 --> 46:46.053
Thank you.

46:47.513 --> 46:48.472
What brings you here?

46:50.349 --> 46:52.309
This is the camera you gave me.

46:52.643 --> 46:53.811
I came to give it back.

46:53.894 --> 46:55.229
I told you to just take it.

46:55.312 --> 46:57.231
I heard you broke your lens
at the station.

46:57.481 --> 46:58.857
I'll take care of that myself.

46:59.149 --> 47:02.152
Both my third
and fourth secretary are here.

47:02.236 --> 47:04.530
Leave unless you want them
to find out about you.

47:04.613 --> 47:07.199
You might run into my mom.
You know how it is.

47:07.658 --> 47:09.493
Water in the face, and money envelopes.

47:09.743 --> 47:12.204
Are you a king or something?
I'm not scared at all.

47:12.788 --> 47:14.248
What did I even do?

47:15.123 --> 47:17.584
It might not be much for you,
but it's too much for me.

47:17.751 --> 47:19.461
What do you take me for?

47:20.045 --> 47:21.630
-Hey!
-Oh, that was scary.

47:21.964 --> 47:23.924
Why did she leave her bag behind?

47:24.466 --> 47:25.467
I need to run.

47:27.886 --> 47:30.556
Returning that camera
was the right thing to do.

47:30.973 --> 47:32.432
This thing is so expensive.

47:34.768 --> 47:36.144
What did I just do?

47:37.062 --> 47:38.188
Oh, my bag!

47:38.730 --> 47:39.773
My wallet!

47:43.944 --> 47:44.778
Here!

47:56.957 --> 47:58.750
What is their relationship?
That's odd.

47:59.209 --> 48:02.588
That's Bap-soon... I mean,
your wife's friend from the wedding.

48:02.754 --> 48:03.839
Yes, she is.

48:11.597 --> 48:12.931
There! That car!

48:13.015 --> 48:16.560
That white luxury car,
follow it closely, please.

48:20.647 --> 48:23.692
<i>The number you dialed is turned off.</i>
<i>Please leave a voicemail.</i>

48:23.775 --> 48:25.527
Why did he turn his phone off?

49:18.872 --> 49:21.458
Why would he drive here
and then take the subway?

49:28.757 --> 49:30.467
<i>The door is open.</i>

49:36.181 --> 49:38.141
<i>The train is now departing.</i>

49:38.767 --> 49:39.893
I caught him.

49:44.648 --> 49:46.149
Why do you keep smiling?

49:47.317 --> 49:48.986
Is this a time for you to smile?

50:06.920 --> 50:07.754
<i>Excuse me.</i>

50:08.171 --> 50:10.090
Are you taking pictures
without permission?

50:10.424 --> 50:11.383
Why would I do that?

50:14.386 --> 50:15.846
<i>Are you really a survivor of</i>

50:15.929 --> 50:18.473
the Namyeong Station accident from
seven years ago?

50:23.645 --> 50:27.983
Do you remember the person
who miraculously survived with you?

51:39.262 --> 51:42.849
I am so touched that you invited
me to your home, Madam.

51:43.725 --> 51:49.106
This is the most luxurious newlywed home
I've ever seen.

51:49.189 --> 51:50.565
What is this? What's going on?

51:50.982 --> 51:52.984
The water isn't going down. Fix it.

51:53.068 --> 51:54.277
Oh, so...

51:55.195 --> 51:56.696
you called me...

51:56.780 --> 51:59.991
to ask me to fix the sink?

52:00.617 --> 52:02.285
Isn't that what a secretary does?

52:03.703 --> 52:05.747
Well, a secretary...

52:05.831 --> 52:07.791
Yes, I will get on it.

52:07.874 --> 52:11.128
I wish I had a secretary like you,
Secretary Hwang.

52:11.670 --> 52:13.004
Secretaries are expensive.

52:13.922 --> 52:14.840
Goodness.

52:21.555 --> 52:22.806
Oh So-ri!

52:24.683 --> 52:26.226
Do you hear the waves?

52:27.060 --> 52:29.521
Me? I'm in Hawaii, of course.

52:30.188 --> 52:32.524
The ocean is so bright and clear.

52:32.607 --> 52:34.568
It's half water and half fish.

52:35.861 --> 52:37.863
Ah, look at the waves.

52:38.655 --> 52:40.532
Why are you calling us on your honeymoon?

52:41.908 --> 52:43.326
You're just dying to show off.

52:45.036 --> 52:46.997
I was wondering
if I should tell you or not.

52:47.998 --> 52:50.333
Ma-rin's been seeing someone.

52:50.417 --> 52:51.334
Really?

52:51.877 --> 52:54.045
I was going to introduce
her to Secretary Hwang.

52:54.171 --> 52:55.714
Who is he, and what does he do?

52:56.256 --> 52:58.758
<i>Oh, I don't know if I should tell you.</i>

52:59.634 --> 53:02.888
I can just guess.
Is he someone you can't talk about?

53:03.013 --> 53:05.307
Is he married, by any chance?

53:06.016 --> 53:08.852
Hey! Is the chairman of Myreits married?

53:10.645 --> 53:11.980
<i>It's Yong-jin's company's CEO</i>

53:12.314 --> 53:15.192
that she's been seeing.

53:18.737 --> 53:20.655
No dog or cat would even fall for that.

53:20.739 --> 53:22.616
I don't want to hear any more. Bye.

53:22.741 --> 53:23.575
My gosh.

53:26.536 --> 53:29.414
What is... Bap-soon is seeing who?

53:29.497 --> 53:30.749
Dating who?

53:31.917 --> 53:32.876
Earlier today...

53:32.959 --> 53:34.336
This isn't working.

53:34.461 --> 53:37.631
I saw her meeting with
our company's chairman.

53:38.715 --> 53:39.591
Saw who?

53:40.050 --> 53:41.218
That person, Bap-soon.

53:41.301 --> 53:43.595
I don't know why,
but she was with our chairman.

53:43.678 --> 53:45.055
They seemed very close.

53:46.556 --> 53:48.558
Are you sure it was Bap-soon?

53:49.142 --> 53:50.060
Yes, Bap-soon.

53:51.561 --> 53:53.521
Not just any Bap-soon
in the neighborhood...

53:53.772 --> 53:55.690
but the Bap-soon that said,
"give me rice"?

53:55.857 --> 53:58.526
Yes, that Bap-soon.

<i>My last day.</i>

54:56.459 --> 54:57.669
<i>How did I get to this day?</i>

54:59.629 --> 55:00.505
Where are you?

55:01.840 --> 55:04.134
Where are you?
Don't you know your own voice?

55:05.510 --> 55:06.761
I'm driving.

55:07.637 --> 55:09.597
<i>Have you found a way?</i>

55:10.640 --> 55:12.142
There isn't a way.

55:12.309 --> 55:13.184
<i>What?</i>

55:14.019 --> 55:16.896
And you're driving right now?
Are you crazy?

55:17.397 --> 55:19.024
Don't you know what today is?

55:20.025 --> 55:20.984
Where are you now?

55:21.901 --> 55:23.236
You should go back now.

55:23.570 --> 55:26.114
If I die, you'll be in danger too.

55:26.948 --> 55:29.868
<i>Lock yourself up at home,</i>
<i>or go to the mountains somewhere.</i>

55:30.118 --> 55:33.163
I don't want to use up my last moments
talking about this stuff.

55:34.122 --> 55:36.958
Last? Did you say last?

55:37.459 --> 55:38.877
You pathetic fool!

55:39.336 --> 55:40.920
I'm on my way to Namyeong Station.

55:41.921 --> 55:44.049
I'm going to cross the subway
one last time.

55:44.132 --> 55:46.509
I said don't say the word "last"!

55:48.136 --> 55:49.387
There's no way you're me.

55:49.763 --> 55:53.141
There's no way I'd become such a loser
like you.

56:21.211 --> 56:22.545
Hey, Yu So-joon.

56:23.046 --> 56:23.922
Yu So-joon!

56:26.633 --> 56:27.467
Hey, you.

56:28.551 --> 56:31.888
Why don't you try making things work
with that woman?

57:11.386 --> 57:13.346
It's dangerous. Stay back!

57:13.430 --> 57:15.807
It's dangerous. Stay back!

I'm scared.

57:36.870 --> 57:37.954
Don't leave.

57:40.623 --> 57:41.583
I...

57:43.626 --> 57:45.086
You may not know this.

57:46.337 --> 57:48.882
I saved you once from becoming disabled.

Don't worry.

57:51.968 --> 57:53.595
-I...
-Please move.

57:58.266 --> 58:03.313
I... will save you.

58:23.625 --> 58:25.668
I feel nervous.

<i>I remembered</i>

58:36.804 --> 58:41.226
<i>we met</i>

<i>Do you want to meet now?</i>

58:44.437 --> 58:46.272
<i>I'll wait at Namyeong Station.</i>

59:00.036 --> 59:01.621
<i>I'm in a really good mood now.</i>

59:03.164 --> 59:04.374
<i>Just because...</i>

59:08.253 --> 59:11.130
<i>No matter who you are...</i>

59:11.839 --> 59:13.633
<i>I'm just happy that you're alive.</i>

<i>If that version of you dies,</i>
<i>I don't know what will happen to you here.</i>

<i>There's something going on with So-joon</i>
<i>and you know what it is.</i>

Don't try that.
