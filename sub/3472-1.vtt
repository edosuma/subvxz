<i>Ghost Two,
this is Echo One. Ghost Two, this is Echo One.</i>

01:26.819 --> 01:29.788
<i>E.T.A.: four minutes.
Repeat: four minutes.</i>

01:56.749 --> 01:58.649
Intel confirmed.
Nine hostiles, three marines.

01:58.751 --> 02:01.652
<i>Ghost Two, you are not
to engage. Alpha Team is on its way.</i>

02:01.754 --> 02:04.552
No time.

03:04.533 --> 03:06.763
- You guys ready to go home?
- Yeah.

03:28.090 --> 03:30.786
- How do we get around 'em?
- We don't.

03:33.963 --> 03:36.625
We go through 'em.

03:47.642 --> 03:50.304
<i>Atten-hut! Look sharp, marine.</i>

03:50.411 --> 03:53.710
As you were, gentlemen.

03:53.814 --> 03:57.716
- Triton.
- Sir?

03:57.818 --> 04:00.548
Outside. Ten minutes.

04:00.655 --> 04:03.146
Yes, sir.

04:11.098 --> 04:14.295
<i>We've approached
this thing from every angle.</i>

04:14.402 --> 04:17.632
The judge advocate's done
hearing your case.

04:17.738 --> 04:21.173
- What about an appeal?
- They're not accepting more appeals.

04:22.610 --> 04:27.377
Bottom line is, you disobeyed a direct order.

04:27.481 --> 04:29.540
You're being discharged.

04:33.454 --> 04:37.015
You served your unit, your corps
and your country with honor, son.

04:37.124 --> 04:40.093
Walk away with dignity.

04:42.363 --> 04:44.957
Colonel...

04:45.066 --> 04:47.193
I'm a marine.

04:48.703 --> 04:52.400
One of the best. Remember that.

04:52.506 --> 04:57.375
On behalf of a grateful nation
and the United States Marine Corps...

04:57.478 --> 05:00.743
I thank you for your loyal service.

05:52.600 --> 05:55.433
- Thank you.
- Oh!

06:04.078 --> 06:05.978
You're home.

06:31.572 --> 06:33.972
- You all right?
- Yeah.

06:34.074 --> 06:38.670
Yeah, I just- I can't believe you're here.

06:51.759 --> 06:55.126
You know, the hardest thing...

06:55.229 --> 06:58.687
about you leaving was not knowing.

07:00.100 --> 07:04.332
You know, not knowing
where you were...

07:04.438 --> 07:07.066
not knowing if you're coming home...

07:07.174 --> 07:11.907
not knowing if I'm gonna get
that phone call saying that you wouldn't be.

07:12.012 --> 07:14.810
You married a marine, Kate.

07:14.915 --> 07:18.407
I know it's not gonna be
easy for you, John.

07:18.519 --> 07:20.953
We'll figure it out together.

07:22.990 --> 07:26.289
I'm home now, and I'm not goin' anywhere.

07:26.393 --> 07:31.330
Good. And speaking of that...

07:31.432 --> 07:33.332
are you sure about
starting this job tomorrow?

07:33.434 --> 07:37.268
- Oh!
- I just think there's so many
other things you could be doing.

07:37.371 --> 07:40.340
If I sat around here all day, I'd go insane.

07:42.042 --> 07:45.569
I just want you to be happy, John.

07:45.679 --> 07:48.239
I am happy. Come on.

07:48.349 --> 07:52.115
- Oh! Geez. Where are we going?
- To make me happy.

08:05.633 --> 08:08.761
- I'll be right back.
- You got it, man.

08:08.869 --> 08:10.769
What?

08:10.871 --> 08:14.102
<i>You got it, man.
You know, Scarface. Come on.</i>

08:14.208 --> 08:16.574
Do it again.

08:16.677 --> 08:18.611
Okay. You got it, man.

08:18.712 --> 08:21.442
Wow. That's horrible.

09:25.279 --> 09:27.110
- How you doing?
- Fine, sir.

09:46.166 --> 09:48.293
Excuse me.

09:53.440 --> 09:55.567
Everybody down.

09:57.144 --> 10:00.170
Everybody on the ground, now!

10:02.616 --> 10:05.176
Ladies and gentlemen,
keep your heads down and your mouths shut.

10:05.285 --> 10:08.049
I don't wanna see any eye contact.

10:08.155 --> 10:10.749
<i>I have severe intimacy issues and a gun...</i>

10:10.858 --> 10:13.759
so do yourselves a favor
and don't look up.

10:17.798 --> 10:19.857
What I want is on
the other side of this door...

10:19.967 --> 10:25.405
but that's gonna be a little tricky
because... it's bulletproof.

10:25.506 --> 10:28.998
So here's how we're gonna do it.
Hi, honey. Can I borrow you for a second?

10:30.878 --> 10:33.870
<i>- How you doin' in there, sport?
- Oh, God! Please!</i>

10:33.981 --> 10:37.712
Oh, don't look at him.
He can't help you.

10:37.818 --> 10:39.911
Please! I have children!

10:40.020 --> 10:42.716
I don't think he cares.

10:42.823 --> 10:45.951
Please!

11:03.410 --> 11:06.208
Fill it.

11:13.253 --> 11:16.222
Get down!

11:30.571 --> 11:34.007
Thank you.

11:34.108 --> 11:36.941
Rome.

11:38.278 --> 11:41.270
<i>You gotta hit me.
It's gotta look real-</i>

11:41.381 --> 11:43.406
For the cops.

11:52.389 --> 11:54.289
That's real.

11:57.761 --> 11:59.729
Well, the cops are comin'.

11:59.830 --> 12:03.197
I'd love to stay and chat,
but, uh, I can't.

12:03.300 --> 12:07.259
I apologize for that little
outburst of anger I showed earlier.

12:07.370 --> 12:09.736
That's really more for dramatic purposes
than anything else.

12:11.094 --> 12:14.928
I hope that what I've done here today
doesn't force you to have...

12:15.031 --> 12:20.025
a negative opinion of me or how you think
I feel about the great state of South Carolina.

12:20.136 --> 12:22.570
'Cause I love it here. I do.

12:22.672 --> 12:25.402
I love the people.

12:25.508 --> 12:28.204
Enjoy the rest of your day.

13:24.634 --> 13:26.534
What? Too much?

13:35.978 --> 13:37.946
Ooh!

13:50.226 --> 13:53.593
Okay.

13:53.696 --> 13:56.221
We know how they got in here.

13:56.332 --> 13:59.199
Once they're in, they don't bother
with any small stuff.

13:59.302 --> 14:03.705
They just go right for the vault
with 12 million in diamonds in it.

14:03.806 --> 14:07.003
The same diamonds
that were delivered just 24 hours ago.

14:07.109 --> 14:10.306
What are the odds of that?

14:10.413 --> 14:12.711
And how did our guys know...

14:12.815 --> 14:15.181
that they were gonna get
so lucky today?

14:15.284 --> 14:18.185
We could ask our friend
on the floor over there.

14:18.287 --> 14:20.551
I'll bet he knows.

14:35.805 --> 14:37.739
I don't care.

14:37.840 --> 14:40.707
No, do you understand
what I'm saying? Oh, really?

14:40.810 --> 14:43.938
See if you can understand this.

15:02.832 --> 15:05.596
Is this what you do all day?

15:05.701 --> 15:08.295
Hmm? I had a Game Boy...

15:08.404 --> 15:10.304
but they took it.

15:18.514 --> 15:22.075
Come on, man. This is a great job.

15:22.184 --> 15:25.153
Good benefits. Great money.

15:25.254 --> 15:28.246
<i>A couple two, three years,
they move you to management.</i>

15:29.692 --> 15:31.592
How long you been working here?

15:31.694 --> 15:33.594
Nine years.

15:34.931 --> 15:36.831
How come you're not in management?

15:42.538 --> 15:44.130
Security.

15:46.008 --> 15:50.138
We'll be right there.
Psycho ex-boyfriend on 12.

15:53.082 --> 15:56.347
Rick, have you lost your mind?
This is my job.

15:56.452 --> 15:59.114
Oh, really? It doesn't
look like a whorehouse.

15:59.221 --> 16:01.621
Where's all the other whores?
Where's your pimp?

16:01.724 --> 16:05.490
<i>You were with him. That's the reason you
didn't answer your cellphone all weekend!</i>

16:05.594 --> 16:07.755
Sir, could you please come with us?

16:07.863 --> 16:09.922
Don't mess with me, pork chop.

16:10.032 --> 16:12.159
<i>- "Pork chop"?
- You're causing a scene.</i>

16:12.268 --> 16:16.432
You think this is a scene? Wait till I tell
Daddy about the little whore he raised!

16:16.539 --> 16:19.702
- Sir, I'm just gonna have to ask you-
- Ask me to what?

16:19.809 --> 16:24.473
- Take a seat, flattop. I'll get to you in a second.
- Oh, really?

16:24.580 --> 16:29.176
Get your hands off me!
Why are you so angry?

16:34.824 --> 16:38.817
You got the Drake.
Dude, let me call you back later.

16:38.928 --> 16:41.055
Because I am trapped in an elevator...

16:41.163 --> 16:43.188
<i>with a couple of jackasses, that's why!</i>

16:49.839 --> 16:52.967
We kindly ask you
to leave the premises, sir.

16:54.310 --> 16:56.710
Thanks.

17:00.449 --> 17:04.818
Seriously, just spit-balling here.
Tell me if I'm close.

17:04.920 --> 17:08.320
Right out of high school,
straight into the military?

17:08.424 --> 17:11.257
Realized you'd never be
all you thought you could be...

17:11.359 --> 17:14.386
and that's how you ended up
as a rent-a-cop.

17:14.497 --> 17:17.489
Tell me I'm wrong.

17:19.001 --> 17:21.560
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

17:21.670 --> 17:24.662
- The genie tried to hit me!
- I know. I saw that,
and he shouldn't have done that.

17:24.773 --> 17:27.936
You shouldn't have done that.
But he missed, and you're fine.

17:28.044 --> 17:31.343
<i>We deal with people like this every day,
and in order to avoid an incident...</i>

17:31.447 --> 17:33.347
sometimes you just
gotta let things go.

17:33.449 --> 17:37.351
<i>Yeah? Well, you better
tell your boyfriend to back off.</i>

17:37.453 --> 17:41.549
Unfortunately for the genie,
this is not one of those times.

18:00.676 --> 18:02.940
Oh!

18:07.049 --> 18:10.917
It's on now. See, you really messed up.

18:11.020 --> 18:13.716
Somewhere, somehow,
somebody just got all this on video.

18:15.524 --> 18:18.789
<i>By the time you go to sleep tonight,
I'm gonna own this building.</i>

18:18.894 --> 18:21.886
And tomorrow...

18:21.997 --> 18:24.488
don't be late.

18:24.600 --> 18:28.627
'Cause when you clock in, you're fired!

18:46.589 --> 18:48.489
Johnny.

18:53.295 --> 18:55.286
A toast.

18:55.397 --> 18:58.491
To your first and last day on the job.

18:58.601 --> 19:01.399
Yeah.

19:01.504 --> 19:03.836
- About that-
- Dude, I told you, don't worry about it.

19:03.939 --> 19:06.430
It's not the first time
I've been suspended.

19:06.542 --> 19:09.773
That's not it. Um-

19:09.879 --> 19:12.814
You'll find another job.
You got all that training.

19:12.915 --> 19:15.315
Training.

19:15.417 --> 19:19.012
Covert reconnaissance.
Close-quarter hand-to-hand combat.

19:19.121 --> 19:21.021
Demolition.

19:21.123 --> 19:23.523
Not a high call in the workplace
for skills like that, Joe.

19:23.626 --> 19:27.289
Okay, but you're a smart guy.
You can do whatever you want.

19:27.396 --> 19:29.956
You don't get it. It's not-

19:30.065 --> 19:33.193
It's not about work.
It's not about a job.

19:33.302 --> 19:35.327
Being a marine meant everything to me.

19:38.440 --> 19:42.740
Now I go and get fired
from some bullshit security job.

19:42.845 --> 19:45.871
Sorry.

19:45.981 --> 19:48.176
I don't know what to do.

19:50.386 --> 19:52.684
Look.

19:52.788 --> 19:57.054
I'm not gonna try and pretend
I know what you're going through...

19:57.159 --> 19:59.127
'cause I don't.

20:00.930 --> 20:05.162
And-And your time as a marine-
Yeah, it's over.

20:05.267 --> 20:08.395
And that sucks, man.

20:08.504 --> 20:10.404
But your life's not over.

20:10.506 --> 20:13.031
<i>I mean, it's changing...</i>

20:13.142 --> 20:15.110
but you gotta learn to change with it.

20:17.746 --> 20:19.976
Sometimes-

20:20.082 --> 20:24.781
Sometimes, it's good to just take
a step back and see what you still have.

20:29.491 --> 20:33.222
You know, I think I'm gonna
go home and see my wife.

20:33.329 --> 20:35.524
Yeah. She's hot.

20:46.642 --> 20:49.076
What happened today?

20:54.650 --> 20:58.142
We made a lot of money.

20:58.254 --> 21:00.950
In the vault... with the kid.

21:02.591 --> 21:05.082
That kid showed that
he couldn't keep his mouth shut.

21:05.194 --> 21:09.460
And Morgan blowin' up that cop car?

21:09.565 --> 21:11.795
He went a little overboard.

21:11.900 --> 21:14.266
But in all fairness to Morgan...

21:14.370 --> 21:18.033
I was firing an automatic weapon at those cops.

21:18.140 --> 21:21.632
Dead cops, all those witnesses-

21:21.744 --> 21:24.235
Doesn't that pose
a potential problem for us?

21:24.346 --> 21:27.543
So does a prison term.

21:27.650 --> 21:31.211
Bottom line is, we got away clean.

21:35.090 --> 21:37.422
What's the matter, Angela?

21:37.526 --> 21:40.051
Don't you trust me anymore?

21:47.102 --> 21:49.070
Look at me.

21:51.874 --> 21:54.342
That kid knew my name.

21:54.443 --> 21:58.345
That's dangerous for all of us.

21:58.447 --> 22:02.474
Baby, is there anything in these eyes that
makes you think I could ever hurt you?

22:15.297 --> 22:19.233
- What?
- Let's forget about what
you did to our guy in the vault.

22:19.335 --> 22:23.465
You killed two cops today,
and that's a problem.

22:23.572 --> 22:25.472
Don't start with me.

22:25.574 --> 22:27.974
You arrogant bastard.
You've lost control.

22:28.077 --> 22:30.409
That's where you're wrong, my friend.

22:30.512 --> 22:32.810
You see...

22:35.451 --> 22:38.682
- I've gained control.
- Is that right?

22:38.787 --> 22:41.255
You bet your ass that's right.

22:41.357 --> 22:44.349
<i>What's the matter with you, Rome?
Have you lost your mind?</i>

22:44.460 --> 22:46.655
<i>Have you forgotten
who you're talking to?</i>

22:46.762 --> 22:49.629
I know exactly who I'm talking to.

22:49.732 --> 22:53.099
You see, I have the diamonds.
Therefore, I have the power.

22:53.202 --> 22:56.501
You have no idea of the level of hell
I could bring down on you.

22:56.605 --> 23:00.132
Yeah, but you won't,
not if you wanna see these diamonds.

23:00.242 --> 23:04.178
Tomorrow, noon. I get my diamonds,
you get your money.

23:18.894 --> 23:23.627
Listen. About what happened at work today-

23:23.732 --> 23:26.565
I'm not tellin' anybody.

23:26.668 --> 23:28.636
Cool.

23:41.683 --> 23:44.208
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

23:44.319 --> 23:47.049
- How was work?
- Fine.

23:47.156 --> 23:50.922
Yeah? What? What happened?

23:51.026 --> 23:54.257
- Talk to me.
- Nothing.

23:55.364 --> 23:57.127
Stuff.

23:57.232 --> 23:59.496
<i>They're hired to protect us.</i>

23:59.601 --> 24:02.229
But who will protect us from them?

24:02.337 --> 24:06.068
- Security guards out of control tonight at 11:00.
- Mmm.

24:06.175 --> 24:09.770
"Stuff." Like you throwing
a guy out of a window?

24:09.878 --> 24:12.472
Yeah.

24:15.784 --> 24:19.515
I thought my days of worrying
about you were over.

24:19.621 --> 24:23.057
What happened?

24:23.158 --> 24:26.889
- This isn't me.
- Well, you jumped into work
the minute you got back.

24:26.995 --> 24:31.898
Kate, what was I supposed to do?
Come home, sit around?

24:32.000 --> 24:35.299
- That's not me. I can't do that.
- I know you can't.

24:37.072 --> 24:40.269
- What if we just took off?
- What?

24:40.375 --> 24:43.867
Yeah, just... left. Gone.

24:43.979 --> 24:47.437
Do something crazy. We'll get up
in the morning and we'll go somewhere.

24:47.549 --> 24:50.518
- Where?
- I don't know where. Anywhere. It doesn't matter.

24:50.619 --> 24:54.111
That's not the point. I just-
I've been thinking a lot about it.

24:54.223 --> 24:58.182
- You have?
- Yeah.

24:58.293 --> 25:01.456
- Okay.
- What do you think? Just me and you.

25:01.563 --> 25:05.294
I really wanna do this. Come on.

25:05.400 --> 25:07.197
Say yes.

25:07.302 --> 25:10.135
Say yes.

25:10.239 --> 25:14.266
- John, say yes! Come on!
- Okay, okay! Yes, yes.

25:29.925 --> 25:32.758
Hey, man! You're Lincoln Kennedy!

25:32.861 --> 25:36.024
- Man, what are you doin' here?
- I don't know what you're talkin' about, man.

25:36.131 --> 25:39.396
Oh, come on, 72. I know it's you.

25:39.501 --> 25:42.766
Husky Hall of Fame,
three consecutive Pro Bowls.

25:42.871 --> 25:45.772
Man, you even started
in a Super Bowl.

25:45.874 --> 25:50.538
You didn't win, but you started.

25:50.646 --> 25:54.343
Come on, man.
I know it's you.

26:02.891 --> 26:06.520
Morgan!

26:06.628 --> 26:08.960
Thanks, L.K.

26:11.533 --> 26:13.592
Let's take a walk.

26:13.702 --> 26:16.865
- Rock candy?
- Oh, man, you know I hate rock candy.

26:16.972 --> 26:19.600
Oh, that's right,
because of that one time.

26:22.144 --> 26:24.942
- Ooh.
- Yeah.

26:25.047 --> 26:27.538
Let's walk it off, big guy.

26:27.649 --> 26:30.117
- How'd you like that Benz I hooked you up with?
- Liked it?

26:30.218 --> 26:32.413
Shit! 24-valve V-8.

26:32.521 --> 26:35.456
Fourmatic all-wheel drive.
What's not to like?

26:35.557 --> 26:38.219
If you like that, you're gonna love this.

26:38.327 --> 26:40.557
- What's it gonna be, a Mustang?
- Nah.

26:40.662 --> 26:42.755
- A Jag?
- Better.

26:42.864 --> 26:46.459
- Come on, man. Tell me, what is it?
- Right there.

26:49.504 --> 26:51.472
Man, that's a minivan.

26:51.573 --> 26:54.133
Rome said inconspicuous.

26:54.242 --> 26:57.075
But how are you gonna send
a brother out in a minivan?

26:57.179 --> 27:00.444
- Man, I'm a criminal, not a soccer mom!
- Come on, big guy.

27:00.549 --> 27:02.176
CD, DVD.

27:02.284 --> 27:05.151
If you want, I'll even have
Johnny throw some spinners on it.

27:05.253 --> 27:07.016
- Fuck you!
- Or not.

27:07.122 --> 27:10.023
Maybe I'm not making myself clear.

27:10.125 --> 27:13.686
You see, I am a black man.

27:13.795 --> 27:15.820
- Yeah, I got that.
- Okay.

27:15.931 --> 27:19.094
Okay, and that is a minivan.

27:19.201 --> 27:21.260
Right.

27:21.370 --> 27:23.668
Black men don't drive minivans, Frank.

27:23.772 --> 27:25.637
They do now.

27:25.741 --> 27:30.508
Morgan, the five of you
are never gonna fit in one of those.

27:30.612 --> 27:33.638
Take the van. Nobody pays attention.

27:33.749 --> 27:35.649
You guys can just disappear.

27:35.751 --> 27:38.015
What do you say?

27:42.491 --> 27:44.686
Keys are in it. Knock yourself out.

28:23.699 --> 28:27.430
<i>Mount Cedar. I used to go to camp there.</i>

28:28.837 --> 28:31.032
God, I haven't thought
about that in a long time.

28:33.608 --> 28:36.202
But the mountains are hours away.

28:36.311 --> 28:38.802
You sure you don't wanna
just stop at the beach?

28:38.914 --> 28:41.781
- I think I've seen enough sand.
- Okay.

28:41.883 --> 28:46.343
Besides, you're not the only one with
childhood memories of the mountains.

28:46.455 --> 28:48.787
You never told me
that you went to Mount Cedar.

28:48.890 --> 28:53.054
It wasn't Mount Cedar. Further up.

28:54.629 --> 28:56.529
So are you gonna tell me where?

28:56.631 --> 28:59.862
It was just a place that my daddy
used to take us when we were kids.

28:59.968 --> 29:02.835
What'd you guys do up there?
Was it fun?

29:02.938 --> 29:05.202
It was all right.

29:05.307 --> 29:08.105
- Dad liked it.
- Why?

29:08.210 --> 29:10.940
I guess it's 'cause he knew
it was far enough away...

29:11.046 --> 29:14.209
where nobody could hear
me and my brother scream.

29:16.618 --> 29:18.711
We gotta get some gas.

29:31.867 --> 29:33.767
You want anything?

29:33.869 --> 29:36.838
- Uh, a Diet Coke.
- Okay.

29:42.844 --> 29:45.574
- Nice butt.
- What?

30:33.795 --> 30:36.127
Oh, man.

31:04.559 --> 31:06.322
How you doin'?

31:12.033 --> 31:13.864
Cadillac man, huh?

31:16.504 --> 31:19.564
Yeah.

31:19.674 --> 31:23.405
- What happens there stays there.
- What?

31:25.680 --> 31:28.240
The Vegas sticker.

31:32.287 --> 31:35.552
Oh, yeah. It's my brother's car.

31:38.260 --> 31:42.253
- He lives in Vegas.
- You visit him much?

31:42.364 --> 31:44.229
Couple times a year.

31:44.332 --> 31:46.664
Me too. My mom lives there.

31:46.768 --> 31:48.998
I just love it there, you know?

31:49.104 --> 31:51.436
Especially downtown.

31:52.641 --> 31:54.700
<i>You ever go to the Olympus?</i>

31:54.809 --> 31:57.369
Oh, not since they tore it down last year.

31:59.114 --> 32:00.706
Oh, man.

32:00.741 --> 32:00.899
Oh, man.

32:03.341 --> 32:06.071
Don't move.

32:33.795 --> 32:35.695
Great.

32:37.799 --> 32:40.097
Take the truck!

32:46.474 --> 32:49.443
Come here! Where you goin'? Come here!

32:49.544 --> 32:53.537
- Stay down!
- John!

32:54.849 --> 32:57.875
- Shut up!
- John!

32:57.986 --> 33:02.389
- Get off of me! John!
- Where the hell did she come from?

33:02.490 --> 33:06.620
- Do we kill her?
- No. We might need a hostage.

33:06.728 --> 33:09.390
<i>John!</i>

33:12.066 --> 33:16.162
<i>Get off me! John!</i>

33:27.382 --> 33:29.646
<i>Morgan, get in the truck!</i>

34:47.998 --> 34:52.690
Okay, keep pressure on that.
I'm gonna call for help.

35:14.055 --> 35:16.455
Highway Patrol, this is John Triton.

35:16.557 --> 35:20.084
You have officers down at Manze's Gas.
Multiple assailants.

35:20.194 --> 35:23.755
Four men, one woman headed
southbound on I-95 in a black Navigator.

35:23.865 --> 35:26.629
They have a hostage. It's my wife.

35:51.325 --> 35:54.488
"Kate Triton." Married to John Triton.

35:54.595 --> 35:56.893
<i>Sergeant John Triton.</i>

35:56.998 --> 35:58.932
She married a marine.

35:59.033 --> 36:02.594
What'd you marry him for? Benefits?

36:04.705 --> 36:06.605
Hey!

36:06.707 --> 36:08.971
- Settle down!
- Get off me!

36:09.076 --> 36:12.307
<i>Settle down!</i>

36:16.884 --> 36:18.784
You gotta be kiddin' me.

36:21.122 --> 36:22.817
The cops.

36:22.924 --> 36:26.087
That ain't the cops.

36:27.795 --> 36:30.525
I hate cops.

36:30.631 --> 36:32.656
And rock candy.

36:36.270 --> 36:38.636
Shoot him.

37:37.532 --> 37:39.261
Will somebody please shoot this guy!

37:39.367 --> 37:41.858
- What does it look like we're doing?
- Missing.

37:58.953 --> 38:01.251
Hey, slow down!

38:05.793 --> 38:07.920
Look out!

38:11.365 --> 38:13.959
Hey!

38:24.078 --> 38:26.478
Whoa!

39:05.086 --> 39:07.418
No, no, no, no!

39:19.367 --> 39:22.598
This guy's like the Terminator.

40:36.043 --> 40:39.035
You murdering sons of bitches!

40:39.146 --> 40:41.171
Somebody shut her up
and get her out of here.

40:41.282 --> 40:44.183
<i>You murderers!</i>

40:46.287 --> 40:49.347
Angie, baby, I know
you got a hair trigger...

40:49.457 --> 40:51.448
<i>but I said shut her up, not kill her.</i>

40:51.559 --> 40:54.289
We might need an insurance policy.

40:56.030 --> 40:58.430
Get a rope and tie her up.

41:10.144 --> 41:12.738
Put your hands together.

41:14.648 --> 41:17.310
Front axle's history.

41:17.418 --> 41:19.818
We're not goin' anywhere in this thing.

41:19.920 --> 41:23.913
- Now, you figured that out all by yourself, huh?
- Actually, I did.

41:24.024 --> 41:27.926
Yeah. But, hey,
you know what else I figured out?

41:28.028 --> 41:30.189
What's that?

41:30.297 --> 41:33.733
That you're a trigger-happy nut job
who belongs in a cage.

41:39.907 --> 41:43.343
All right!
We are monumentally screwed here...

41:43.444 --> 41:46.902
and the last thing I need is you two
bickerin' like a couple of little girls.

41:47.014 --> 41:50.074
<i>So as of right now, it's over.
Are we clear?</i>

41:50.184 --> 41:53.676
<i>Because if we're not,
I give you my word...</i>

41:53.788 --> 41:55.813
I will absolutely shoot you myself.

41:55.923 --> 42:00.292
- What do we do now?
- The way I see it, we got two options.

42:00.394 --> 42:03.761
"A," we stand here
and try to kill each other-

42:03.864 --> 42:06.958
and then no one gets paid
and someone gets dead-

42:07.067 --> 42:10.833
<i>or "B," we get out of the swamp,
make our drop and collect our dough.</i>

42:10.938 --> 42:14.203
And maybe it's just the greed talkin',
but I'm stickin' with "B."

42:14.308 --> 42:18.142
Yeah, well, I say we move, 'cause
every cop in the state heard that blast.

42:18.245 --> 42:20.611
We'll follow the swamp downstream.

42:20.714 --> 42:23.376
- Through there?
- Yeah, through there.

42:23.484 --> 42:27.284
<i>The trees'll give us
cover from the air.</i>

42:27.388 --> 42:29.856
The swamp will slow down the cops.

42:29.957 --> 42:32.152
What do you wanna do
with our little insurance policy?

42:32.259 --> 42:35.524
Oh, go to hell.

42:35.629 --> 42:38.393
Angie, why'd you do that?

42:38.499 --> 42:42.128
<i>Now Morgan's gotta carry her.</i>

42:42.236 --> 42:45.399
Morgan's got-
Morgan's gotta do what?

42:55.349 --> 42:57.408
Watch out for crocodiles.

42:57.518 --> 43:00.646
What's the matter with you?
Ain't no crocodiles in South Carolina.

43:19.673 --> 43:21.732
- Detective Van Buren.
- Sir.

43:21.842 --> 43:26.438
- What do we got?
- Well, we got one deceased officer here...

43:26.547 --> 43:30.711
and another found
seriously wounded there.

43:30.818 --> 43:33.548
The guy who called in?

43:33.654 --> 43:37.715
John Triton. He's an ex-marine,
and he's for real.

43:37.825 --> 43:40.293
His description of the perps
sounds like the crew...

43:40.394 --> 43:43.090
that hit the diamond store
in town yesterday.

43:43.197 --> 43:46.360
- Roadblocks up?
- Yes, sir.

43:46.467 --> 43:48.958
Choppers and search teams
are on their way.

43:49.069 --> 43:54.029
- So what else do we know about these guys?
- They're sloppy.

43:54.141 --> 43:56.632
<i>Unit four, come in.</i>

43:59.179 --> 44:02.080
- Go ahead.
- We got a report of a multiple car accident.

44:02.182 --> 44:04.446
Shots fired five miles
south of your position.

44:04.551 --> 44:08.146
That Highway Patrol car from your location
was involved. Check and advise.

44:08.255 --> 44:09.950
I'm en route.

44:38.352 --> 44:42.049
Detective Van Buren, Homicide.

44:42.156 --> 44:44.351
I'm gonna assume you're John Triton.

44:49.296 --> 44:53.494
- They took my wife.
- That's a matter for law enforcement now.

44:53.600 --> 44:57.161
Listen, I've seen 'em kill three people.

44:57.271 --> 44:59.535
<i>My wife will not be number four.</i>

44:59.640 --> 45:03.804
- I can't give you permission to pursue.
- I'm not asking for it.

45:03.911 --> 45:07.347
You know, this whole area's tidal.

45:07.448 --> 45:11.009
The way the water level changes,
these guys are gonna be impossible to track.

45:11.118 --> 45:14.610
<i>- I can handle it.
- Triton?</i>

45:14.722 --> 45:16.883
I've seen what these guys can do.

45:18.425 --> 45:20.723
You better hurry.

45:22.730 --> 45:27.690
Get the chains out. I want
this river dragged. Are we in the air yet?

46:21.822 --> 46:25.121
If you and I are gonna be friends,
you need to learn some manners.

46:25.225 --> 46:27.250
Bitch.

46:27.361 --> 46:30.853
Man, the hell with this.

46:30.964 --> 46:33.558
What, do you got a problem, brother?

46:33.667 --> 46:37.933
My problem is walking
through this dirty-ass swamp...

46:38.038 --> 46:40.404
with the entire county lookin' for us...

46:40.507 --> 46:44.034
<i>because somebody decided
that killin' cops was a good idea.</i>

46:44.144 --> 46:47.545
Genius, that somebody's you.

46:47.648 --> 46:50.139
- You're the one that killed the cops.
- Yeah. Both of 'em.

46:52.086 --> 46:55.613
Oh, so now we wanna start
playin' the blame game, huh?

46:55.722 --> 46:58.282
Always wanna blame the black man.

46:58.392 --> 47:01.418
<i>Somebody steals a car, the black man did it.</i>

47:01.528 --> 47:04.292
House gets robbed- Black man.

47:04.398 --> 47:07.390
Cop car gets blown up
by an Israeli single-shot...

47:07.501 --> 47:10.129
shoulder-fired rocket launcher-
Guess who.

47:10.237 --> 47:12.467
The black man.

47:14.074 --> 47:17.134
That's right, Vescera.
The black man.

47:17.244 --> 47:21.908
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Morgan, you are one crazy son of a bitch.

47:22.950 --> 47:25.441
I like that. I do.

47:25.552 --> 47:28.988
<i>But no one's gonna get killed here
until I give the go-ahead...</i>

47:29.089 --> 47:31.819
and I didn't give it.

47:40.801 --> 47:43.929
- What was that?
- The go-ahead.

47:50.310 --> 47:52.210
<i>Why Vescera?</i>

47:52.312 --> 47:55.145
You never know when
you'll need a crazy son of a bitch.

48:00.654 --> 48:04.317
- I thought you said there were no crocodiles.
- Those are alligators.

48:06.326 --> 48:08.726
Do you think they're hungry?

48:08.829 --> 48:10.797
Not anymore.

48:17.871 --> 48:21.466
- What do you got?
- Nothin' yet.

48:25.078 --> 48:27.979
There's no way anybody
could have lived through this.

48:28.081 --> 48:31.812
- Keep me informed.
- Yes, sir.

50:06.747 --> 50:08.806
Yeah?

50:08.915 --> 50:11.509
- Where are you?
- How ya doin'?

50:11.618 --> 50:13.984
- How am I doing?
- Not so good, huh?

50:14.087 --> 50:16.988
Well, you know that triple homicide
I was just involved in?

50:17.090 --> 50:20.548
- The one all over the news?
- Yeah, right. That's the one. Yeah, I know. Bad.

50:20.661 --> 50:25.098
Anyways, I think I can now add
kidnapping to my litany of atrocities.

50:25.198 --> 50:29.032
As a matter of fact, I know I can, because
she's standing there right in front of me.

50:29.136 --> 50:32.037
<i>- Why are you telling me all this?
- Why am I telling you all this?</i>

50:32.139 --> 50:34.334
Well, because in the middle
of blowing up the gas station...

50:34.441 --> 50:38.377
killing the marine and now kidnapping,
I had a great idea-

50:38.478 --> 50:40.639
As a matter of fact,
it's such a great idea...

50:40.747 --> 50:42.840
that I even came up
with a name for it.

50:42.949 --> 50:45.179
It's called "you're out."

50:45.285 --> 50:48.846
<i>Which basically means
you get nothing-</i>

50:48.955 --> 50:52.516
No split, no diamonds,
no payoff, no nothing.

50:52.626 --> 50:56.528
- We had a plan, Rome.
- I know we had a plan, but plans change.

50:56.630 --> 50:59.326
At least, for one of us they do.

50:59.433 --> 51:01.628
Now listen, if you think
for one second-

51:01.735 --> 51:03.635
There's no way you can
get away with this without me.

51:03.737 --> 51:04.863
- Can you hold on?
- Yeah.

51:04.971 --> 51:06.871
Yeah?

51:06.973 --> 51:08.770
This is he.

51:08.875 --> 51:10.638
I'm just calling to let you know...

51:10.744 --> 51:13.212
- that your order has been approved.
- Yeah?

51:13.313 --> 51:15.804
Now, does that include
all the premium channels...

51:15.916 --> 51:17.884
- and the sports package?
- It sure does.

51:44.177 --> 51:46.941
All right, the air show's over.

51:47.047 --> 51:49.572
Let's get the hell out of here.

51:52.452 --> 51:54.420
Go on.

53:02.222 --> 53:06.750
That's a creepy-ass snake.
Slimy and scaly.

53:06.860 --> 53:09.829
It's terrifying, all these animals and bugs.

53:09.930 --> 53:13.331
I hate this, man.
I'm not built for this stuff.

53:13.433 --> 53:16.664
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with me? Think about it.

53:16.770 --> 53:19.705
<i>How many brothers
you see in Deliverance?</i>

53:19.806 --> 53:21.706
The answer is "zero."

53:21.808 --> 53:24.675
Do you know why?
'Cause brothers don't camp.

53:24.778 --> 53:28.646
Why does everything always
have to be racial with you, Morgan?

53:28.748 --> 53:31.615
Why do you feel the need
to confine us to these labels?

53:31.718 --> 53:34.346
Why can't we just be people?

53:34.454 --> 53:36.479
What do you think, Kate?

53:36.590 --> 53:38.558
I think you're psychotic.

53:38.658 --> 53:42.219
Ho, ho. Now, how can you say that?

53:42.329 --> 53:44.695
You don't even know me.

53:44.798 --> 53:46.993
That's very judgmental.

53:50.096 --> 53:52.291
Is she looking at me?

53:58.438 --> 54:01.498
I'm gonna be totally honest here. I, uh-

54:01.608 --> 54:04.668
I thought that you and I, you know-

54:04.778 --> 54:07.906
We could have had a future,
you know, if it wasn't for-

54:11.584 --> 54:13.176
Mmm.

54:15.989 --> 54:19.254
- Mmm.
- What?

54:20.727 --> 54:23.753
- Mmm.
- You're insane.

54:27.600 --> 54:29.500
Maybe.

54:32.172 --> 54:34.163
Good talk.

54:42.449 --> 54:44.815
- Cops.
- Get the truck loaded.

55:14.914 --> 55:17.280
Hold it right there, cop.

55:20.053 --> 55:22.613
I'm not a cop.

55:22.722 --> 55:24.986
I'm just looking for some people.

55:25.091 --> 55:26.991
Boy, I will end you.

55:29.929 --> 55:32.454
I told you, I'm not a cop.

55:43.209 --> 55:45.905
Wait here. And somebody shut her up.

55:52.218 --> 55:54.778
- What do you got?
- Nothin'.

55:54.888 --> 55:56.651
All right.

55:56.756 --> 55:58.656
<i>- Van Buren here.
- Sir, come in.</i>

55:58.758 --> 56:00.589
<i>What's goin' on at the south fork?</i>

56:00.693 --> 56:03.685
There's nothing here.
We're headed for the marina.

56:03.797 --> 56:06.823
I want every shack
on that riverbank searched.

56:06.933 --> 56:08.867
- Find 'em.
- Copy that.

56:23.082 --> 56:24.982
What did you find?

56:25.084 --> 56:28.383
There's a lodge up there.
It's swarmin' with cops.

56:29.489 --> 56:31.855
What do you want to do now?

56:31.958 --> 56:35.485
We'll let the cops leave,
and then we'll cross the river.

56:49.242 --> 56:52.040
<i>Get 'em loaded. We gotta move.</i>

57:02.789 --> 57:05.917
What the hell you doin' out here, cop?

57:06.960 --> 57:08.894
You guys got it all wrong.

57:10.797 --> 57:13.527
Save your lies, boy.

57:15.535 --> 57:20.029
If I was a cop,
I'd have a badge. A gun.

57:20.139 --> 57:23.370
I don't. I'm just out here trying to-

57:28.982 --> 57:32.042
Just trying to what?

57:32.151 --> 57:34.085
They got choppers buzzin' around here.

57:34.187 --> 57:36.121
And I got you sneakin' up our asses.

57:36.222 --> 57:38.190
And you're not a cop?

57:41.227 --> 57:43.388
Right.

57:43.496 --> 57:45.396
You're right.

57:45.498 --> 57:47.398
I'm a cop.

57:47.500 --> 57:50.025
They're tracking
my G.P.S. right now.

57:50.136 --> 57:53.196
G.P.S.? I told you to search him.

57:53.306 --> 57:55.866
- I did!
- Find it!

57:55.975 --> 57:57.875
<i>Where's the goddamn bug, cop?</i>

59:54.060 --> 59:55.994
<i>What you doin', man?</i>

59:56.095 --> 59:58.359
No contact point. No alarm.

59:58.464 --> 01:00:00.432
It's a freakin' shack.

01:00:03.970 --> 01:00:05.733
Get in there.

01:00:16.416 --> 01:00:18.384
Something die in here?

01:00:18.484 --> 01:00:21.612
I don't know, but it smells like baked ass.

01:00:23.723 --> 01:00:26.351
Morgan, see if you can
go find a generator.

01:00:28.027 --> 01:00:29.028
- Why me?
- Why not?

01:00:29.063 --> 01:00:30.689
- Why me?
- Why not?

01:00:30.797 --> 01:00:33.595
<i>What if there's some guy out there
with a hockey mask and a hatchet?</i>

01:00:33.699 --> 01:00:38.136
Or a group of country-ass crackers
cravin' some man love?

01:00:38.237 --> 01:00:40.398
It'll be fun, like summer camp.

01:00:40.506 --> 01:00:42.804
Yeah, but brothers don't camp.

01:00:43.943 --> 01:00:46.468
Well, actually, I did go to camp once.

01:00:46.579 --> 01:00:49.377
<i>I was 13 years old.</i>

01:00:51.451 --> 01:00:54.443
And there was this camp counselor-
Cool honky.

01:00:54.554 --> 01:00:56.988
Timothy.

01:00:57.090 --> 01:00:59.320
Tim.

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:05.088
Or, as he liked to be called,
Johnny Whiplash.

01:01:07.967 --> 01:01:10.458
Well, tell us, Morgan,
what did this, uh...

01:01:10.570 --> 01:01:13.300
Johnny Whiplash have to offer?

01:01:15.074 --> 01:01:17.838
Well, at first, he offered friendship.

01:01:20.179 --> 01:01:23.171
Then some rock candy.

01:01:25.051 --> 01:01:29.613
Then he offered me something
that I never should have accepted.

01:01:35.876 --> 01:01:38.242
Wow.

01:01:38.933 --> 01:01:40.992
Well, good luck with all that.

01:01:41.102 --> 01:01:44.333
Now go find the generator.

01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:01.220
Hey.

01:02:01.322 --> 01:02:03.882
Hey, what we talked about-

01:02:05.993 --> 01:02:08.689
<i>Ain't leavin' this room, right?</i>

01:02:08.796 --> 01:02:11.788
No. No.

01:02:11.899 --> 01:02:13.924
Now go find the goddamn generator.

01:03:31.938 --> 01:03:33.997
Cool.

01:04:59.094 --> 01:05:01.460
- Hello.
- Yeah, hey. It's me.

01:05:01.563 --> 01:05:03.326
Hold on.

01:05:03.431 --> 01:05:05.160
<i>- Frank.
- What?</i>

01:05:05.266 --> 01:05:07.962
It's Rome.

01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:14.704
- So how's my Cadillac?
- Plan A's screwed.

01:05:14.809 --> 01:05:17.778
- No shit. You're all over the news.
- We're switching to plan "B."

01:05:17.879 --> 01:05:20.677
- What the hell is plan "B"?
- I don't know what plan "B" is.

01:05:20.782 --> 01:05:24.513
<i>- I'm makin' this up as I go.
- Great.</i>

01:05:24.619 --> 01:05:27.520
- You know that joint, Rita's, down by the marina?
- Yeah.

01:05:27.622 --> 01:05:30.318
<i>- I want you to leave a car there for me.
- I'm gonna need time.</i>

01:05:30.425 --> 01:05:33.258
- Give me till tomorrow.
- No. As soon as you can.

01:05:33.361 --> 01:05:36.558
<i>Looks like we're going to Phoenix.</i>

01:05:42.151 --> 01:05:44.449
What are you lookin' at?

01:05:58.072 --> 01:06:01.906
Why so sad?
Don't like your new friends?

01:06:03.237 --> 01:06:08.504
- You're pathetic.
- How so?

01:06:12.346 --> 01:06:15.645
<i>You're like his little puppet.</i>

01:06:24.221 --> 01:06:26.155
So what's the plan?

01:06:26.256 --> 01:06:28.281
Where are we goin'?

01:06:28.392 --> 01:06:30.792
What, no faith?

01:06:30.894 --> 01:06:31.895
I have faith. I just need to know
if I'm still in the loop.

01:06:31.930 --> 01:06:33.988
I have faith. I just need to know
if I'm still in the loop.

01:06:36.767 --> 01:06:39.201
There's this guy in Phoenix-

01:06:40.804 --> 01:06:43.136
I figure since we did 100% of the work...

01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:46.437
why not keep 100% of the diamonds?

01:06:47.577 --> 01:06:49.477
Can he move 'em?

01:06:49.579 --> 01:06:51.638
That he can, my friend.

01:06:51.748 --> 01:06:53.943
That he can.

01:06:57.421 --> 01:07:00.618
- You grew up on the water, right? Louisiana?
- Miami.

01:07:00.724 --> 01:07:02.988
Yeah, whatever.

01:07:03.093 --> 01:07:05.789
See if you can go get
that boat started out there.

01:07:08.098 --> 01:07:11.192
Hey, uh, Bennett.

01:07:12.787 --> 01:07:15.517
Check out Morgan.
See what he's up to.

01:07:36.108 --> 01:07:38.076
Morgan.

01:08:22.393 --> 01:08:24.292
How many are left?

01:08:24.395 --> 01:08:26.453
There's two upstairs.

01:08:28.832 --> 01:08:30.993
- You wait here.
- I'm not waiting anywhere.

01:08:33.604 --> 01:08:35.572
You don't know what you're walking into.

01:08:35.673 --> 01:08:37.903
Listen. It's only a matter of time...

01:08:38.008 --> 01:08:39.999
before they realize
these two aren't coming back.

01:08:40.109 --> 01:08:43.011
I gotta do something,
and I gotta do it now.

01:08:45.249 --> 01:08:47.149
Okay.

01:09:26.457 --> 01:09:28.118
Playtime's over.

01:09:30.294 --> 01:09:32.694
There's a crazy son of a bitch.

01:09:32.796 --> 01:09:35.094
Where is she?

01:09:35.198 --> 01:09:38.635
Oh, this just gets better and better.

01:09:38.736 --> 01:09:40.465
Put it down.

01:09:42.339 --> 01:09:44.966
All right.

01:09:47.176 --> 01:09:50.374
<i>Easy, big guy.
He's still got something I need.</i>

01:09:50.481 --> 01:09:53.575
Listen, I don't care what you do with him.
I just want my wife.

01:09:53.684 --> 01:09:56.414
Oh, he's not gonna do
anything to me-

01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:59.978
Not until he finds out what happened
to those stolen diamonds.

01:10:00.090 --> 01:10:02.081
<i>'Cause that's what he's after-</i>

01:10:02.192 --> 01:10:04.387
His cut.

01:10:05.496 --> 01:10:08.556
Isn't that right, Officer?

01:10:08.666 --> 01:10:11.965
Now, why don't you
just take a second...

01:10:12.069 --> 01:10:14.435
and let that sink in there, champ?

01:10:18.242 --> 01:10:22.576
- Where are they, Rome?
- Where's what?

01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:24.614
Gimme my damn diamonds!

01:10:24.715 --> 01:10:26.774
Whoa! Calm down, V.B.

01:10:26.884 --> 01:10:29.079
I know our last deal
didn't work out too well...

01:10:29.186 --> 01:10:31.484
<i>but I'm willing to make a new one.</i>

01:10:31.588 --> 01:10:34.853
You see, I tried to kill this guy twice today.

01:10:34.959 --> 01:10:36.984
<i>He just won't die.</i>

01:10:38.095 --> 01:10:40.188
Maybe I'm having an off day.
I don't know.

01:10:40.297 --> 01:10:43.494
But if you shoot him right now...

01:10:44.768 --> 01:10:46.894
I'm willing to split
the diamonds with you.

01:10:46.924 --> 01:10:49.484
What do you say?

01:11:18.605 --> 01:11:21.369
- There's our ride. Let's go.
- Go where? What happened?

01:11:21.475 --> 01:11:23.443
A marine showed up, that's what.

01:11:23.543 --> 01:11:25.443
- John!
- He's still alive?

01:12:01.982 --> 01:12:04.576
<i>Let's go!</i>

01:12:11.184 --> 01:12:13.744
Oh, no. You're not putting me in there.

01:12:13.853 --> 01:12:16.117
You're not putting me in there.

01:12:42.415 --> 01:12:45.873
Out of the water!
Get out of the water now!

01:12:55.294 --> 01:12:58.320
Turn around.
Put your hands above your head.

01:13:06.806 --> 01:13:09.536
Turn around.

01:13:09.642 --> 01:13:12.270
- I'm John Triton.
- Shut up!

01:13:12.378 --> 01:13:15.836
Down on your knees.
Lace your hands behind your head.

01:13:15.948 --> 01:13:18.815
<i>- I'm the guy that called you. They have my wife.
- Shut up, boy!</i>

01:13:18.918 --> 01:13:22.945
You're under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent.

01:13:23.055 --> 01:13:25.489
I suggest you use it.

01:13:27.827 --> 01:13:31.024
You're dead, boy!

01:13:42.341 --> 01:13:44.741
Look at that.

01:13:44.844 --> 01:13:46.835
You don't mind if I keep this one, do you?

01:13:51.083 --> 01:13:53.381
I'm sure we can work something out.

01:13:53.486 --> 01:13:56.387
Work something out?

01:14:03.296 --> 01:14:05.992
Whoa. Wait a minute, baby.

01:14:06.098 --> 01:14:08.931
- Work something out?
- I gotta drive. Baby, I can't do this.

01:14:09.035 --> 01:14:11.663
Say yes. Mmm.

01:14:11.771 --> 01:14:15.400
Baby, I gotta drive.
Oh, yes. Yes.

01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:30.621
What's the matter, baby?
Don't you trust me anymore?

01:14:36.963 --> 01:14:40.797
<i>Unit 4, this is Command. Over.</i>

01:14:41.633 --> 01:14:43.999
We gotta get rid of this car.

01:14:44.102 --> 01:14:46.332
Any suggestions?

01:14:46.438 --> 01:14:48.338
<i>- Van Buren.
- Yeah.</i>

01:14:50.623 --> 01:14:52.557
I got one.

01:15:21.857 --> 01:15:24.758
- Hi.
- Hey, girl.

01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:27.761
- Nice truck.
- Wanna go for a ride?

01:15:36.938 --> 01:15:38.838
<i>Base to River Unit.</i>

01:15:38.940 --> 01:15:40.840
<i>We have a positive
identification on your trucker.</i>

01:15:40.942 --> 01:15:43.172
<i>Last logged in drivin' a gray semi.</i>

01:15:43.278 --> 01:15:46.042
<i>A vehicle matching
that description was just seen...</i>

01:15:46.147 --> 01:15:49.708
<i>five miles north of Rita's Marina,
heading southbound...</i>

01:15:49.818 --> 01:15:51.786
<i>on Route 16.</i>

01:16:01.196 --> 01:16:03.061
So what's the plan?

01:16:03.164 --> 01:16:06.258
We'll pick up our clean car,
and then we're home free.

01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:53.741
Get that bitch off me.

01:17:02.123 --> 01:17:05.991
I don't see the car.
Let's check the other lot.

01:17:14.069 --> 01:17:17.129
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

01:17:50.105 --> 01:17:51.697
John!

01:17:53.141 --> 01:17:55.507
John!

01:18:01.282 --> 01:18:03.409
John!

01:18:28.877 --> 01:18:30.401
John!

01:18:40.288 --> 01:18:42.188
John!

01:18:48.997 --> 01:18:50.965
Gotta go, babe.

01:18:51.866 --> 01:18:54.300
John!

01:21:01.629 --> 01:21:04.393
Say hello to your wife!

01:22:28.864 --> 01:22:31.264
Come on. Come on.

01:22:37.483 --> 01:22:39.576
No, Kate. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

01:22:44.056 --> 01:22:46.422
Wake up!

01:22:51.964 --> 01:22:54.091
<i>Come on!</i>

01:23:00.339 --> 01:23:02.933
<i>Come on.</i>

01:23:07.896 --> 01:23:10.126
Come on, wake up!

01:23:10.232 --> 01:23:12.257
Wake up!

01:23:12.367 --> 01:23:14.494
That's it. Come on.

01:23:14.603 --> 01:23:16.264
That's it.

01:23:50.739 --> 01:23:52.707
We should have gone to the beach.

01:23:57.408 --> 01:24:08.846
