EITHER YOU GIVE ME
MY MONEY, OR ELSE...

20:25.500 --> 20:27.100
I'LL TELL YOUR MOTHER.

20:27.100 --> 20:29.367
TELL MY MOTHER?

20:30.567 --> 20:33.667
THAT WAS
YOUR BIG "OR ELSE"?

20:33.667 --> 20:38.400
YOU'RE THE WORST BULLY
IN THE HISTORY OF BULLIES.

20:38.400 --> 20:40.467
I'M NOT AFRAID
OF MY MOM.

20:40.467 --> 20:42.000
YOU SHOULD BE.

20:43.934 --> 20:45.900
ZACK, WHAT DID YOU DO NOW?

20:45.900 --> 20:48.300
NOTHING, MOMMY.

20:48.300 --> 20:50.967
HE BORROWED
$43.20 FROM ME
IN THE GAME ROOM,

20:50.967 --> 20:52.100
AND HE CAN'T
PAY IT BACK.

20:52.100 --> 20:56.500
ONLY $30. IT WAS
THAT STINKIN' INTEREST RATE.

20:56.500 --> 21:00.200
ZACK, DIDN'T I TELL YOU,
NEITHER A BORROWER
NOR A LENDER BE?

21:00.200 --> 21:01.934
WELL, I'M HALFWAY THERE.

21:01.934 --> 21:03.233
I NEVER LEND.

21:03.233 --> 21:06.000
ZACK, YOU ARE
IN BIG TROUBLE.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.400
DOESN'T IT COUNT
FOR SOMETHING

21:07.400 --> 21:09.367
THAT I DIDN'T LET CODY
THROW THE SPELLING BEE

21:09.367 --> 21:11.667
LIKE MAYNARD TRIED
TO MAKE ME DO?

21:11.667 --> 21:12.934
YOU DID WHAT?

21:12.934 --> 21:14.000
DAD, I CAN EXPLAIN!
I--

21:14.000 --> 21:15.200
DON'T BOTHER.

21:15.200 --> 21:17.667
YOU HAVE DISGRACED
THE GRAND TRADITION

21:17.667 --> 21:19.300
OF THE AMERICAN
SPELLING BEE.

21:20.934 --> 21:22.734
NO CROSSWORD PUZZLES
FOR A MONTH, YOUNG MAN.

21:22.734 --> 21:24.033
CAN I FINISH THE ONE
I STARTED?

21:24.033 --> 21:25.834
NO! NOW COME ON!

21:25.834 --> 21:27.834
WE'RE MEETIN' GRANDMA
AT THE BEEF SHACK.

21:27.834 --> 21:30.600
OW! OW! OW!
OW! OW!

21:30.600 --> 21:32.100
WOW.

21:32.100 --> 21:34.600
HEARING WHAT
A TERRIBLE THING
MAYNARD DID,

21:34.600 --> 21:38.233
KIND OF MAKES WHAT I DID
SEEM PRETTY MINOR.

21:38.233 --> 21:39.600
DOESN'T IT?

21:39.600 --> 21:41.200
NOPE.

21:41.200 --> 21:42.300
N-O-P-E.

21:42.300 --> 21:43.767
NOPE!

21:43.767 --> 21:47.000
O-W! O-W! O-W!
O-W! O-W!

21:50.367 --> 21:52.133
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
WHO IS IT?

21:52.133 --> 21:55.000
CAN'T SAY,
BUT I'VE GOT GIFTS!

21:58.467 --> 21:59.934
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THE MASK.

21:59.934 --> 22:01.500
NOW, I'M HERE
TO HELP YOU.

22:01.500 --> 22:03.100
OH, BUT
IT'S A SECRET,

22:03.100 --> 22:04.567
AND YOU CAN'T TELL
ANYONE.

22:04.567 --> 22:06.200
AND IT'S GOING
TO BRING ME INNER JOY.

22:06.200 --> 22:07.100
OH!

22:07.100 --> 22:10.100
BOY, IT'S HOT
UNDER HERE.

22:10.100 --> 22:12.834
YOU KNOW,
THIS IS SO SWEET.

22:12.834 --> 22:14.300
HOW CAN WE EVER THANK YOU?

22:14.300 --> 22:15.567
BAKE ME A CAKE

22:15.567 --> 22:17.033
AND BRING IT
TO THE TIPTON.

22:17.033 --> 22:18.700
ASK FOR LONDON.

22:20.133 --> 22:21.133
WHO, BY THE WAY,
IS NOT ME.
