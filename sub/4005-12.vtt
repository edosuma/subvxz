AND TOOK A PICTURE
WITH HIS CELL PHONE.

20:49.291 --> 20:51.375
NOW BASED ON THIS,
I'M THINKING

20:51.375 --> 20:54.041
THAT TRAVIS HAS ALREADY
COMPLETED TABLEAU NUMBER SEVEN.

20:54.041 --> 20:56.417
DOES ANYONE THINK I'M WRONG?

OUT THERE, LOOKING FOR SIGNS

BUT NOTHING YET.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.583

- SO TRAVIS IS DONE
WITH HIS WORK.

21:03.667 --> 21:05.375
SO NOW WHAT?
- WELL, NOW ALL TRAVIS HAS TO DO

21:05.375 --> 21:06.750
IS SIT BACK AND WAIT
FOR THE END OF THE WORLD.

21:06.750 --> 21:08.458
- WHICH MEANS
HE COULD BE ANYWHERE.

21:08.458 --> 21:09.583
- OR MAYBE NOT.

21:09.583 --> 21:11.458
MAYBE HE'S SOMEWHERE
VERY SPECIFIC.

21:11.458 --> 21:13.166

WE CAN GRAB HIS CRAZY ASS.

- YEAH.

21:26.250 --> 21:27.709
- AND THEIR DOG.

21:27.709 --> 21:29.917
- I GUESS FIDO WANTED TO WATCH
THE END OF THE WORLD TOO.

21:29.917 --> 21:32.709
- SO YOU'RE THINKING IF TRAVIS
IS FOLLOWING GELLAR'S DRAWINGS,

21:32.709 --> 21:34.625
THIS POINTS
TO WHERE HE'LL BE NEXT?

21:34.625 --> 21:36.709
- AND WHAT TIME
HE'LL BE THERE.

21:36.709 --> 21:40.208
ALL THIS SHIT'S GONNA GO DOWN
WHEN THE ECLIPSE IS HAPPENING.

21:40.208 --> 21:41.417
- WHICH IS FOUR HOURS
FROM NOW.

21:41.417 --> 21:43.542
- WHERE DO YOU GO
TO WATCH AN ECLIPSE?

21:43.542 --> 21:45.125
- WELL,
YOU'D WANT A GOOD VIEW.

21:45.125 --> 21:48.250
NO OBSTRUCTIONS.
- HIGH GROUND.

21:48.250 --> 21:49.750
- YEAH, LOOK WHERE THEY ARE.
THEY'RE ON A MOUNTAINTOP.

21:49.750 --> 21:51.583
- COULD BE WRONG,
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE

21:51.583 --> 21:53.458
THERE ARE NO MOUNTAINS
IN MIAMI.

21:53.458 --> 21:54.792
- UNLESS YOU FIND
A SUBSTITUTE.

21:54.792 --> 21:57.583

- IT DOES, RIGHT?

I'M GONNA CALL
LAGUERTA.

22:03.333 --> 22:06.125
I WANT TO STATION UNIS ON TOP
OF MIAMI'S TALLEST BUILDINGS.

22:06.125 --> 22:07.667
- THERE'S A LOT
OF TALL BUILDINGS IN MIAMI.

22:07.667 --> 22:09.625
I MEAN, THAT'S GONNA REQUIRE
A LOT OF MANPOWER.

22:09.625 --> 22:10.917

IF TRAVIS GETS AWAY,

22:10.917 --> 22:15.667
HE IS GONE
FOR GOOD.

DIFFERENT.

BUT MAYBE IT'S A BUILDING.

- WHAT FUCKING TRANSFER?
I DIDN'T ASK FOR A TRANSFER.

24:52.542 --> 24:53.792

IN FOR YOU.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.458
DEB WANTS ME TO GO BACK
TO A CRIME SCENE,

44:06.458 --> 44:08.458
COLLECT SOME EVIDENCE.

44:08.458 --> 44:09.333
- OKAY.

44:09.333 --> 44:11.125
- LET ME SEE
THOSE PAWS.

44:11.125 --> 44:13.417
LET ME SEE
THOSE PAWS.

44:13.417 --> 44:14.959
LET ME SEE THOSE--

44:14.959 --> 44:17.000
[sighs]
I'M GLAD YOU'RE SAFE.

44:17.000 --> 44:20.792
[sighs]

44:20.792 --> 44:24.750
WHETHER YOU'RE A LION OR A LAMB,
I'LL ALWAYS LOVE YOU.

44:30.792 --> 44:34.792
MAYBE THAT'S ALL I NEED
TO PASS ON TO YOU.

44:40.709 --> 44:41.792
- [laughs]

44:46.583 --> 44:52.250
[phone rings]

44:52.250 --> 44:53.500
- YOU WERE RIGHT.

44:53.500 --> 44:54.542
- DEBRA,
WE CAN SCHEDULE A TIME--

44:54.542 --> 44:57.750
- I TOLD HIM.

44:57.750 --> 44:59.709
I FUCKING TOLD MY BROTHER
THAT I LOVE HIM,

44:59.709 --> 45:02.667
AND HE SAID
"I LOVE YOU" BACK.

45:02.667 --> 45:05.500
NOT "ME TOO"
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

45:05.500 --> 45:08.500
HE ACTUALLY SAID,
"I LOVE YOU."

45:08.500 --> 45:09.750
- WOW.
THAT'S BIG, ISN'T IT?

45:09.750 --> 45:11.250
- YEAH, I MEAN,
I DON'T THINK HE UNDERSTOOD

45:11.250 --> 45:12.375
THAT I'M IN LOVE
WITH HIM,

45:12.375 --> 45:16.166
BUT STILL, HE SAID
THE ACTUAL WORDS...

45:16.166 --> 45:18.125
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

45:18.125 --> 45:19.709
- SO WHAT DO YOU
THINK IT MEANS?

45:19.709 --> 45:21.208
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE FUCK IT MEANS.

45:21.208 --> 45:26.083
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

45:26.083 --> 45:30.583
IS THIS JUST...

45:30.583 --> 45:34.291
HORRIBLY WRONG?

45:34.291 --> 45:36.542
- DOES IT
FEEL WRONG?

45:36.542 --> 45:41.166
- IT MAKES
MY WHOLE LIFE--

45:41.166 --> 45:44.291
[chuckles]

45:44.291 --> 45:47.959
EVERY MAN I'VE EVER LOVED--
MAKE SENSE.

45:47.959 --> 45:51.458
IT'S LIKE I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
LOOKING FOR SOMEONE LIKE DEXTER

45:51.458 --> 45:54.250
OR SOMEONE WHO'S
THE OPPOSITE OF DEXTER

45:54.250 --> 45:55.417
AS A WAY
TO AVOID THE FACT

45:55.417 --> 45:59.792
THAT I'M IN LOVE
WITH HIM.

45:59.792 --> 46:03.125
THAT'S JUST CLEAR
TO ME NOW,

46:03.125 --> 46:06.542
AND I WANT IT
TO BE CLEAR TO HIM.

46:06.542 --> 46:08.208
I WANT HIM
TO UNDERSTAND.

46:08.208 --> 46:11.208
- OKAY.

46:11.208 --> 46:12.750
YOU WANT TO TELL HIM
HOW YOU FEEL

46:12.750 --> 46:14.667
IN A WAY THAT
HE CAN HEAR YOU.

46:14.667 --> 46:19.333
- YES.

46:19.333 --> 46:20.875
[sighs]

46:20.875 --> 46:22.250
[chuckles]
IS THIS HOW IT FEELS

46:22.250 --> 46:26.041
TO BE IN CONTROL
OF YOUR EMOTIONS?

46:26.041 --> 46:28.750
- BUT YOU
CAN'T CONTROL HIS.

46:28.750 --> 46:32.709
YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW HE'S GOING TO REACT.

46:48.083 --> 46:50.333
- [sighs]

46:50.333 --> 46:55.375
HELLO, JESUS.

46:55.375 --> 46:56.917
- HELLO, TRAVIS.

46:56.917 --> 47:00.625
- WHAT?
WHAT IS GOING ON?

47:00.625 --> 47:06.291
- THIS IS THE WAY
THE WORLD ENDS.

47:06.291 --> 47:08.291
YOUR WORLD, ANYWAY.
- NO!

47:08.291 --> 47:09.417
NO, NO!

47:09.417 --> 47:11.542
I'M SUPPOSED TO FINISH
ENACTING THE SEVEN KEYS.

47:11.542 --> 47:12.792
- SORRY.

47:12.792 --> 47:14.625
- BUT I WAS CHOSEN!

47:14.625 --> 47:17.417
I WAS CHOSEN TO BRING
ABOUT THE NEW WORLD.

47:17.417 --> 47:18.750
- CHOSEN TO KILL
INNOCENT PEOPLE?

47:18.750 --> 47:20.792
- NO ONE
IS INNOCENT.

47:20.792 --> 47:22.417
- MY SON IS.
YOU TRIED TO KILL HIM.

47:22.417 --> 47:24.709
- GOD--GOD ALLOWED
HIS SON TO DIE.

47:24.709 --> 47:27.166
- HOW COULD YOU
BELIEVE IN THAT?

47:27.166 --> 47:29.959
- BECAUSE I WALK THE PATH
OF THE RIGHTEOUS.

47:29.959 --> 47:33.083
- I'VE KNOWN PEOPLE
WHO BELIEVED IN GOD.

47:33.083 --> 47:35.041
THEY WOULD NEVER USE
THEIR FAITH

47:35.041 --> 47:39.166
AS A CONVENIENT EXCUSE
TO KILL TEN PEOPLE.

47:39.166 --> 47:41.625
YOU USED GOD.

47:41.625 --> 47:43.625
IT'S NOT
THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

47:43.625 --> 47:47.959
[sighs]
YOU--

47:47.959 --> 47:50.625
YOU ARE
A SHINING EXAMPLE

47:50.625 --> 47:55.417
OF HOW PUTRID
MAN HAS BECOME.

47:55.417 --> 47:59.250
- I AM A FATHER.

47:59.250 --> 48:02.417
A SON.

48:02.417 --> 48:06.834
A SERIAL KILLER.

48:06.834 --> 48:09.417
- YOU'RE GOING
TO BURN IN HELL.

48:09.417 --> 48:14.333
- NO, I THINK
I BELONG RIGHT HERE.

48:14.333 --> 48:17.709
- [sighs]

48:17.709 --> 48:19.291
- BECAUSE MAYBE
THERE IS A PLACE

48:19.291 --> 48:24.375
FOR ME
IN THIS WORLD...

48:24.375 --> 48:29.083
JUST AS I AM.

48:29.083 --> 48:33.583
LIGHT CANNOT EXIST
WITHOUT DARKNESS.

48:33.583 --> 48:38.667
EACH HAS
ITS PURPOSE.

48:38.667 --> 48:41.792
AND IF THERE IS A PURPOSE
TO MY DARKNESS,

48:41.792 --> 48:45.667
MAYBE IT'S
TO BRING SOME...

48:45.667 --> 48:48.792
BALANCE
TO THE WORLD.

48:56.583 --> 48:57.750
BECAUSE,
LET'S FACE IT,

48:57.750 --> 49:02.959
THE WORLD IS GOING TO BE
A BETTER PLACE WITHOUT YOU.

49:02.959 --> 49:05.166
- THE WORLD
IS GOING TO END.

49:05.166 --> 49:07.166
AND WHEN IT DOES,

49:07.166 --> 49:09.583
I WILL BE
BY GOD'S SIDE.

49:09.583 --> 49:12.208
- YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
- YES.

49:12.208 --> 49:15.959
- GOOD FOR YOU.

49:15.959 --> 49:17.709
- YOU'RE MOCKING ME.

49:17.709 --> 49:20.417
- NO,
I ALMOST ENVY YOU.

49:20.417 --> 49:24.917
IT MUST BE NICE
TO BE SO CERTAIN.

49:24.917 --> 49:26.875
- YOU'RE WRONG
ABOUT EVERYTHING

49:26.875 --> 49:29.458
BECAUSE YOU DON'T
BELIEVE IN GOD,

49:29.458 --> 49:31.542
BUT I HAVE FAITH.

49:31.542 --> 49:34.792
I TRUST IN GOD'S PLAN.
- REALLY?

49:34.792 --> 49:36.000
THEN IT MUST BE
GOD'S PLAN

49:36.000 --> 49:40.166
THAT YOU'RE
ON MY TABLE.

49:42.291 --> 49:45.959
DO YOU THINK IT'S GOD'S WILL
THAT I'M ABOUT TO KILL YOU?

49:45.959 --> 49:48.625
GOD HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS!

49:48.625 --> 49:51.250
YOU ARE WRAPPED
IN PLASTIC

49:51.250 --> 49:57.166
BECAUSE I WANT
TO KILL YOU.

49:57.166 --> 50:00.959
- THIS IS NOT HOW
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE!

50:00.959 --> 50:05.625
- MAYBE THIS IS EXACTLY
HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.

50:05.625 --> 50:07.375
[chuckles]

50:07.375 --> 50:10.875
MAYBE EVERYTHING
IS EXACTLY

50:10.875 --> 50:16.667
AS IT
SHOULD BE.

50:16.667 --> 50:18.166
- [gasps]

50:18.166 --> 50:20.667
[sighs]

50:20.667 --> 50:22.333
[gasps]

50:22.333 --> 50:24.125
- OH, GOD.
