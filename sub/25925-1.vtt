01:58.785 --> 02:00.151
I don't think this is it.

02:02.539 --> 02:03.950
Because she said
a white house.

02:04.041 --> 02:05.953
It says 111 Christmas Street.

02:06.043 --> 02:08.080
I know 111 Christmas
but this is a blue house.

02:08.919 --> 02:11.082
I don't know,
maybe it was Christmas Circle.

02:11.173 --> 02:12.233
Well, did you put
Christmas Circle

02:12.257 --> 02:13.293
or Christmas Street?

02:13.383 --> 02:14.794
Honey, I don't know.

02:14.885 --> 02:16.797
I don't know what I put it as.

02:16.887 --> 02:18.924
Okay, well, she said
it was a white house

02:19.014 --> 02:20.255
and this is a blue house.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.432
Well, why don't we ask?

02:24.811 --> 02:26.598
It's not a big deal.
We're lost.

02:27.606 --> 02:29.518
Just check one more time.
Which one...

02:30.567 --> 02:31.753
There's, like,
four Christmases around here.

02:31.777 --> 02:32.938
Why don't we just ask?

02:33.820 --> 02:35.231
Can you just check
one more time?

02:35.322 --> 02:36.904
Honey, you told me...

02:36.990 --> 02:38.950
Just check the e-mail
that she sent one more time.

02:39.034 --> 02:40.034
All right. Okay.

02:42.621 --> 02:44.301
I feel like
such an idiot because...

02:44.873 --> 02:47.707
No, honey,
we can't help it. Just ask.

02:49.753 --> 02:51.119
Take a deep breath.

02:51.463 --> 02:52.829
Let's just go ask.

02:52.923 --> 02:54.414
It's not a big deal.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.591
They have beautiful flowers.

02:56.677 --> 02:57.758
Which one did I say?

02:57.844 --> 02:58.946
Which one did I say?
Which street?

02:58.970 --> 03:01.212
You told me 111th Street.

03:01.306 --> 03:04.424
I typed it in, and now
I'm not sure where we are.

03:10.399 --> 03:12.293
<i>What do I
do, just ring on the doorbell?</i>

03:12.317 --> 03:14.037
<i>I mean, these people
just ring the doorbell.</i>

03:14.486 --> 03:17.069
<i>Relax. It's not
a big deal. We're lost.</i>

03:19.533 --> 03:21.320
<i>Check one more time
which one.</i>

03:21.993 --> 03:23.655
<i>Honey, it says 111...</i>

03:23.745 --> 03:25.098
<i>It could be
five minutes away from here,</i>

03:25.122 --> 03:27.058
<i>and we could be at the wrong
place and not even know it...</i>

03:27.082 --> 03:28.539
Vitals are stable.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.745
<i>I don't know
if it's Christmas Street,</i>

03:30.836 --> 03:32.998
<i>Court, Lane, Circle.</i>

03:33.088 --> 03:34.648
Mother to Child-One.
We're at set-point.

03:34.673 --> 03:36.359
<i>- I copy. Over.
- Running kismet.</i>

03:36.383 --> 03:39.171
<i>I read you,
Lima Charlie. Help me, over.</i>

03:41.888 --> 03:43.768
<i>- Drone in position.
- I read you same.</i>

03:44.015 --> 03:45.381
<i>Awaiting further instruction.</i>

03:45.475 --> 03:46.511
<i>Thermal is up.</i>

03:46.601 --> 03:47.841
<i>Getting in the networks.</i>

03:47.894 --> 03:49.010
<i>We are validating</i>

03:49.104 --> 03:50.248
<i>on our primary
and secondary routes...</i>

03:50.272 --> 03:51.808
Social media is clear.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.264
How's our airspace?

03:53.358 --> 03:54.678
<i>Residential alarm offline.</i>

03:55.986 --> 03:57.477
<i>I've got eyes inside.</i>

03:57.571 --> 03:58.673
Mother,
what's your count?

03:58.697 --> 03:59.841
<i>I've got two
in the kitchen and...</i>

03:59.865 --> 04:00.883
<i>One in the back room.</i>

04:00.907 --> 04:02.009
<i>One in the living room.</i>

04:02.033 --> 04:03.073
<i>I have one upstairs.</i>

04:03.118 --> 04:05.030
- I count five.
- I'm counting five.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.452
<i>I got five, too.</i>

04:06.538 --> 04:09.246
Child-One, there's
five subjects in the house.

04:09.332 --> 04:10.332
Copy, Mother.

04:12.043 --> 04:14.251
Child-One, conditions are set.

04:14.337 --> 04:17.125
Let's get in and out
real quick today. No drama.

04:17.214 --> 04:18.456
Here we go.

04:18.550 --> 04:20.791
<i>Child-Two
and Five engage.</i>

04:22.137 --> 04:23.137
Ding-dong.

04:28.018 --> 04:30.351
<i>You got a female
coming your way, unarmed.</i>

04:34.357 --> 04:36.223
Hi. I'm so sorry
to bother you,

04:36.318 --> 04:37.684
we're looking
for the Larkin home.

04:37.778 --> 04:38.939
Go.

04:39.029 --> 04:40.506
<i>My friend's supposed to
have given this address.</i>

04:40.530 --> 04:41.737
<i>111 Christmas.</i>

04:41.823 --> 04:44.361
<i>My wife, apparently,
gave me the wrong address.</i>

04:44.451 --> 04:45.845
<i>We're visiting friends
and they just moved in.</i>

04:45.869 --> 04:46.989
<i>But they might have given us</i>

04:47.037 --> 04:48.222
<i>the wrong address.
I don't know, honey.</i>

04:48.246 --> 04:49.612
You have the wrong house.

04:49.706 --> 04:51.447
Honey, I told you
it's the wrong street.

04:51.541 --> 04:53.703
We're looking
for 111 Christmas.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.313
Maybe a Christmas Lane...

04:55.337 --> 04:56.498
...or a Christmas Circle?

04:58.965 --> 05:00.001
Look out!

05:10.060 --> 05:11.060
Now.

05:11.770 --> 05:13.511
<i>You, stop. Let's go.</i>

05:14.898 --> 05:16.855
You, here, hands on the wall.

05:16.942 --> 05:18.142
<i>Checking the rear.</i>

05:18.485 --> 05:20.272
<i>- One.
- Two.</i>

05:26.910 --> 05:28.617
You, hands on the wall.

05:29.579 --> 05:31.195
<i>Be advised,
we're internal.</i>

05:33.166 --> 05:34.498
On the wall. Closer.

05:35.377 --> 05:36.377
Three.

05:37.629 --> 05:38.949
Get up.
Against the wall.

05:41.091 --> 05:42.171
Put your hands up.

05:42.926 --> 05:44.206
<i>Sweep upstairs.</i>

05:49.391 --> 05:50.391
<i>Four.</i>

05:53.395 --> 05:54.761
One unknown.

06:02.696 --> 06:03.696
<i>Five.</i>

06:04.489 --> 06:06.401
- Clear.
- That's five.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.449
We got five, let's go.

06:08.910 --> 06:10.367
<i>Five subjects
in custody.</i>

06:10.453 --> 06:12.911
<i>Start the sweep. Commence SSE.</i>

06:12.998 --> 06:13.998
<i>Roger that.</i>

06:14.040 --> 06:15.156
<i>Doug, close it out.</i>

06:19.671 --> 06:21.190
<i>Roger that.
Working on it now.</i>

06:21.214 --> 06:23.134
<i>- Four minutes, 30.
- Clock is ticking.</i>

06:30.974 --> 06:31.974
Turn around.

06:32.267 --> 06:33.267
<i>Blow.</i>

06:33.727 --> 06:34.727
<i>To the left.</i>

06:36.771 --> 06:40.640
I see two computers,
four racks.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.475
<i>Confirm.
What about the safe?</i>

06:43.445 --> 06:44.445
Jackpot.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.200
Turn around.

06:50.285 --> 06:52.151
Against the wall.

06:58.543 --> 06:59.583
<i>Bite.</i>

07:12.807 --> 07:13.888
<i>I'm in.</i>

07:13.975 --> 07:16.183
Child-One, commencing
full dental impressions

07:16.269 --> 07:17.726
for database crosscheck.

07:19.522 --> 07:21.083
Confirm collection
of all SSD drives.

07:21.107 --> 07:22.107
<i>Roger that.</i>

07:23.234 --> 07:25.034
<i>Let's go, people,
the clock is ticking.</i>

07:29.074 --> 07:30.281
<i>Two minutes.</i>

07:34.371 --> 07:35.452
Hands up.

07:40.001 --> 07:41.242
Receiving data dump.

07:42.420 --> 07:44.252
Downloading scans.

07:47.384 --> 07:50.422
My ostensible crew.

07:51.846 --> 07:53.508
My titular crew.

08:03.358 --> 08:04.358
What's that?

08:04.943 --> 08:06.104
Hey, Bishop.

08:07.362 --> 08:09.069
Got a faint heat signal here

08:09.155 --> 08:10.915
on the second floor
on the south-west corner.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.323
<i>Can't really make it out.
Sir, I'm trying to.</i>

08:16.454 --> 08:17.535
Hmm.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.536
What is it? A squirrel?

08:21.626 --> 08:25.085
If that's a squirrel,
it's a big fucking squirrel.

08:26.631 --> 08:30.090
Child-One, Mother.
Strong thermal. Second floor.

08:30.176 --> 08:32.042
<i>Strong thermal
on the second floor.</i>

08:32.136 --> 08:34.379
<i>Copy, Mother.
Child-Two, Child-Three?</i>

08:34.472 --> 08:35.472
<i>Go look into that.</i>

08:36.307 --> 08:38.048
<i>You got 90 seconds,
make it quick.</i>

09:08.882 --> 09:09.882
<i>Clear.</i>

09:15.138 --> 09:17.255
<i>I'm seeing a room
to your left.</i>

09:17.348 --> 09:18.555
<i>There's nothing on my left.</i>

09:18.641 --> 09:19.952
<i>I'm seeing a room
to your left.</i>

09:19.976 --> 09:21.217
<i>There's a door to your left.</i>

09:21.311 --> 09:22.711
<i>It's just a wall,
not a door.</i>

09:23.354 --> 09:25.812
<i>I'm seeing a room...
Fuck. Gun. Gun, gun, gun!</i>

09:47.170 --> 09:48.502
Mother, Child-One,

09:48.588 --> 09:50.508
looks like you were
a little light on your count.

09:50.882 --> 09:52.168
I think
the vest took that.

09:53.510 --> 09:55.404
<i>- You got him. You good?
- I'm good. Let's go.</i>

09:55.428 --> 09:56.464
<i>Sixty seconds.</i>

10:07.732 --> 10:09.085
<i>Child-One,
what are we doing?</i>

10:09.109 --> 10:11.192
<i>Stay put,
we're on the clock.</i>

10:12.153 --> 10:13.894
You got to be
kidding me.

10:15.824 --> 10:17.565
Assault-One KIA.

10:17.659 --> 10:20.868
<i>Child-One, Mother.
Collection is terminated.</i>

10:20.954 --> 10:22.240
<i>We are weapons free.</i>

10:35.218 --> 10:37.005
- Confirm, capture to kill.
- Confirm.

10:38.805 --> 10:41.468
- Confirming capture to kill.
<i>- Confirm.</i>

10:46.187 --> 10:47.187
They're gonna torch it.

10:55.864 --> 10:57.299
- ...<i>Christmas Street.
- 911...</i>

10:57.323 --> 10:59.123
...<i>just sort of
really loud explosion...</i>

10:59.367 --> 11:00.687
Fire and Police
have been alerted.

11:00.743 --> 11:01.859
<i>ETA two minutes.</i>

11:13.715 --> 11:14.751
<i>Thirty seconds.</i>

11:30.982 --> 11:32.098
<i>Twenty seconds.</i>

11:32.984 --> 11:34.295
<i>Okay, so you want me
to waste this guy</i>

11:34.319 --> 11:36.561
<i>in broad fucking daylight?</i>

11:36.654 --> 11:37.485
Confirm.

11:38.198 --> 11:41.032
You're making a mistake.

11:41.117 --> 11:43.825
I've made a lot of them.

11:43.912 --> 11:45.222
<i>Child-One,
the cavalry is en route.</i>

11:45.246 --> 11:47.909
<i>Get the hell out of there.</i>

12:08.478 --> 12:11.221
<i>Kill CCTV-1, CCTV-2.</i>

12:14.025 --> 12:15.186
<i>Let's go.</i>

12:19.155 --> 12:22.114
Child-One, Mother.
You're clear for four miles.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.908
We are gonna be with you
for full exfil.

12:24.994 --> 12:28.453
Continue on the current route
to the park exit.

12:28.539 --> 12:30.656
<i>There will be a parking lot...</i>

12:34.921 --> 12:36.190
<i>Seven people believed to be</i>

12:36.214 --> 12:39.628
<i>members of Russia's FSB,
or State Intelligence Service,</i>

12:39.717 --> 12:42.209
<i>formerly known as the KGB,
were found dead</i>

12:42.303 --> 12:44.636
<i>in, what sources say,
was a Russian safehouse.</i>

12:44.722 --> 12:46.825
<i>Sources inside
the US intelligence community</i>

12:46.849 --> 12:50.138
<i>indicated that this was
an FSB hit on its own,</i>

12:50.228 --> 12:52.686
<i>perhaps an attempt to
manufacture what appeared</i>

12:52.772 --> 12:54.764
<i>to be an assault
on Russian civilians,</i>

12:54.857 --> 12:56.974
<i>but was, in fact,
a kind of suicide...</i>

12:57.068 --> 12:58.587
<i>This is clearly
a slaughterhouse</i>

12:58.611 --> 12:59.692
<i>turned in on itself.</i>

12:59.779 --> 13:01.298
...<i>what they
describe as a quiet, safe,</i>

13:01.322 --> 13:02.608
<i>and friendly community.</i>

13:02.699 --> 13:05.066
<i>One of
the victims, disturbingly,</i>

13:05.159 --> 13:07.321
<i>an 18-year-old Russian male.</i>

13:07.412 --> 13:10.371
<i>This is uncharacteristic for
the KGB to be targeting...</i>

13:11.708 --> 13:13.686
<i>The victim,
apparently 18 years of age.</i>

13:13.710 --> 13:15.167
<i>And this is truly shocking...</i>

13:15.253 --> 13:17.210
<i>White House
official indicated</i>

13:17.297 --> 13:18.737
<i>that this was
a Russia-led operation.</i>

13:18.798 --> 13:20.442
<i>More information
will be coming out.</i>

13:20.466 --> 13:23.004
<i>They have been playing it very
close to the vest of the FBI.</i>

13:23.594 --> 13:25.051
Here's
your non-disclosure.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.879
We're transcribing
and recording.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.773
There might be a finding.

13:30.768 --> 13:33.431
We live in a new world.
These are bloody times.

13:33.521 --> 13:36.605
Evil exists. Horror exists.
The great game continues.

13:38.484 --> 13:39.691
If you have patience,

13:39.777 --> 13:41.457
you wouldn't have expected it
to end, so...

13:42.280 --> 13:43.987
Most governments have
very little patience.

13:44.073 --> 13:45.193
What is a government anyway?

13:45.283 --> 13:46.427
Does a government
have a heartbeat?

13:46.451 --> 13:48.331
Does a government have
ten fingers and ten toes?

13:49.495 --> 13:51.828
A government is capable
of vengeance.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.997
Is a government
capable of slaughter?

13:59.839 --> 14:02.707
<i>The American
people do not see their work</i>

14:02.800 --> 14:04.166
<i>or know their names.</i>

14:21.986 --> 14:24.820
<i>Lieutenant Silva

14:28.368 --> 14:32.032
<i>Subject, James Silva,
age seven.</i>

14:32.497 --> 14:34.217
<i>He's not
like other little boys.</i>

14:34.665 --> 14:37.248
<i>Mrs. Silva, I believe
your son may be gifted.</i>

14:39.295 --> 14:41.255
<i>There's nothing
wrong with you, Jimmy.</i>

14:44.133 --> 14:46.375
<i>Your mind just moves faster
than the other kids.</i>

14:48.221 --> 14:50.463
<i>Snap this
when you can't slow down.</i>

14:51.599 --> 14:53.261
<i>Just like that.</i>

14:55.561 --> 14:57.401
<i>We need to talk
about your anger, Jimmy.</i>

15:01.526 --> 15:03.233
A tragic scene on

15:03.319 --> 15:05.060
<i>Jericho Turnpike
this morning...</i>

15:05.154 --> 15:07.191
...<i>killing
a mother and her twin sons.</i>

<i>A third son,
11-year-old Jimmy Silva,</i>

15:10.618 --> 15:12.280
<i>is in critical condition.</i>

15:23.047 --> 15:24.927
<i>We do have
some other activities.</i>

15:27.927 --> 15:29.967
<i>I won't discuss those other
activities at this time.</i>

15:32.390 --> 15:34.507
<i>It requires
a change in tactics.</i>

15:36.227 --> 15:38.970
<i>A tightly knit,
highly efficient machine.</i>

15:39.897 --> 15:41.959
<i>We will direct
every tool of intelligence,</i>

15:41.983 --> 15:43.394
<i>until there's no refuge.</i>

15:44.402 --> 15:45.546
...<i>ramping up
of these wars</i>

15:45.570 --> 15:47.232
<i>outside of the war zones.</i>

15:48.573 --> 15:50.155
<i>Grade 546...</i>

15:50.241 --> 15:51.361
<i>Eyes on a blue sedan.</i>

15:51.409 --> 15:52.809
<i>Copy.
You're clear to engage.</i>

15:55.663 --> 15:57.120
<i>You're authorized</i>

15:57.206 --> 15:58.684
<i>to go break the law
in other countries,</i>

15:58.708 --> 16:01.792
<i>and you have the presidential
authority to do it.</i>

16:01.878 --> 16:03.647
<i>The real
abilities that we have,</i>

16:03.671 --> 16:06.914
<i>this is something
nobody can even understand.</i>

16:10.011 --> 16:14.005
<i>James Silva,
welcome to the new wars.</i>

17:57.952 --> 17:59.832
I need to know before we start
this conversation

17:59.870 --> 18:01.111
how bad of a mood are you in.

18:02.707 --> 18:03.767
What you want?
Like one to ten?

18:03.791 --> 18:04.827
Yeah.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.658
Seven and rising quickly.

18:06.752 --> 18:09.039
There's no caesium
in the crate, Jimmy.

18:09.130 --> 18:10.166
What?

18:14.260 --> 18:15.421
<i>What was in it?</i>

18:15.511 --> 18:17.127
<i>Twelve cases
of M4 rifles,</i>

18:17.221 --> 18:18.632
<i>18 guns per case,</i>

18:18.723 --> 18:20.510
<i>180 M67 grenades.</i>

18:20.600 --> 18:22.387
We broke them to pieces,
no caesium.

18:22.476 --> 18:23.512
<i>There were paintings.</i>

18:23.603 --> 18:24.705
<i>We tore the canvases
off the frames.</i>

18:24.729 --> 18:25.810
<i>There's no caesium.</i>

18:25.896 --> 18:27.207
<i>Repeat, no caesium.</i>

18:27.231 --> 18:28.750
<i>Repeat, no caesium found.
Just some grenades.</i>

18:28.774 --> 18:30.454
We tore
the whole fucking thing apart.

18:30.651 --> 18:32.108
- Paintings?
- Fakes.

18:32.862 --> 18:34.148
Munch. Norwegian.

18:34.238 --> 18:35.238
Munch as in <i>The Scream?</i>

18:35.323 --> 18:36.689
Yeah. But it wasn't
<i>The Scream.</i>

18:38.576 --> 18:39.976
Well, this is
a big fucking problem.

18:41.329 --> 18:42.329
Where's Alice?

18:42.997 --> 18:44.613
Where is she?
It was her source.

18:44.707 --> 18:46.507
We all thought the source
was credible, Jimmy.

18:46.626 --> 18:47.867
Just shut the fuck up.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.044
I never liked this lead.
Causing avalanches.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.858
This is basically what
this is, this is an avalanche.

18:52.882 --> 18:55.044
'Cause we have now what?
Sam, what do we have now?

18:55.134 --> 18:57.046
- What do we have now, huh?
- Nothing.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.298
- Dougie, what do we have now?
- Nothing.

18:59.388 --> 19:00.924
Six sets of caesium
still missing.

19:01.015 --> 19:03.132
Eleven discs per set.
That's 66 missing discs.

19:03.225 --> 19:05.137
That's 66 dirty bombs.
At least. Right?

19:05.227 --> 19:06.307
We all thought it was real.

19:06.354 --> 19:08.687
Oh, it is very real.
This is a big fucking problem.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.149
What is this?

19:11.651 --> 19:12.732
It's Sam's birthday.

19:12.818 --> 19:13.934
It's my birthday.

19:14.445 --> 19:15.856
Oh. Happy birthday.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.740
No birthday cake.
No birthday cake.

19:25.456 --> 19:27.038
Your source sucked.

19:27.124 --> 19:29.241
- What, he lied to you?
- It happens.

19:29.335 --> 19:32.294
We are well outside the realm
of "it happens," Alice. Okay?

19:32.380 --> 19:34.042
This is not a case
where shit can happen.

19:34.131 --> 19:35.167
We are not talking about

19:35.257 --> 19:36.657
stolen fucking
ice cream cones here.

19:36.842 --> 19:37.958
I'm handling it.

19:38.052 --> 19:39.213
Oh, you're handling it?

19:39.303 --> 19:40.760
Really?
Do you need help with that?

19:40.846 --> 19:41.846
No, I don't.

19:41.931 --> 19:43.888
- Who is the source?
- Local special forces.

19:43.974 --> 19:45.465
You running a cop?

19:45.559 --> 19:48.222
Since when do we trust local
special forces? Jesus, Alice.

19:48.312 --> 19:50.053
He's been an excellent source.

19:50.147 --> 19:51.625
Is that supposed to mean
something to me

19:51.649 --> 19:52.793
that he is
an excellent source?

19:52.817 --> 19:54.086
Do you want me to tell
John Porter,

19:54.110 --> 19:55.396
"Oh, he's
an excellent source"?

19:55.486 --> 19:56.963
No, I don't think so. That
story does not work for me.

19:56.987 --> 19:58.569
It's not a story, Jimmy.
It's the truth.

19:58.656 --> 20:01.399
No, this cannot not work,
all right? I trusted you.

20:01.492 --> 20:02.692
Does that mean anything
to you?

20:04.578 --> 20:05.659
Hello?

20:06.747 --> 20:07.908
I'm handling it.

20:07.998 --> 20:09.059
You know
what's in the container?

20:09.083 --> 20:10.574
Edvard Munch.
You ever seen a Munch?

20:10.668 --> 20:12.409
I mean,
this guy is dark as fuck.

20:12.503 --> 20:13.960
Sounds perfect for you, Jimmy.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.315
You know,
I don't appreciate that.

20:15.339 --> 20:16.659
I actually resent that.
Thank you.

20:17.550 --> 20:18.652
Wow. 120 million at auction.

20:18.676 --> 20:19.712
Jimmy.

20:19.802 --> 20:21.071
He was a Sagittarius,
just like you.

20:21.095 --> 20:21.960
I should have been a painter.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.054
Take a breath.

20:24.181 --> 20:25.181
Go outside.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.365
Yeah, the sign outside
says "ladies."

20:39.822 --> 20:41.609
He hears everything,
never listens.

20:42.116 --> 20:43.482
He listens
to what works for him.

20:43.576 --> 20:44.908
So, what works for him?

20:45.453 --> 20:47.365
Actionable intelligence.

20:48.330 --> 20:49.446
And pain.

20:57.131 --> 20:58.442
<i>The definition
of a war zone</i>

20:58.466 --> 20:59.707
<i>is an interesting thing.</i>

21:00.885 --> 21:03.085
Being a cop in Baltimore might
be every bit as dangerous

21:03.137 --> 21:04.298
as being a cop in Baghdad.

21:11.228 --> 21:12.639
The cops played
the politicians

21:12.730 --> 21:14.141
and the politicians
played the cops

21:14.231 --> 21:16.769
and I don't think anyone ever
knew who is on whose side.

21:22.406 --> 21:23.863
I think he got scared, Jimmy.

21:23.949 --> 21:26.441
He's an honest guy.
He's been 100% reliable.

21:26.535 --> 21:27.637
Yeah,
there's a big difference

21:27.661 --> 21:28.805
between honest and reliable,
Alice.

21:28.829 --> 21:29.829
I'll handle it.

21:30.998 --> 21:33.185
How's that going, by the way?
Do you want me to take that?

21:33.209 --> 21:34.978
- Let me get the phone.
- I want to get it later.

21:35.002 --> 21:36.563
No, you'll take it now and
end whatever is happening

21:36.587 --> 21:37.828
on the other side
of that phone

21:37.922 --> 21:39.441
so you can return home
from that planet to this one.

21:39.465 --> 21:41.145
I need you here with me.
Do you understand?

21:41.217 --> 21:42.217
Can I help you, sir?

21:42.301 --> 21:43.667
Sir. Ma'am,
you have a walk-in.

21:43.761 --> 21:44.905
You know what,
I'll take the walk-in.

21:44.929 --> 21:46.072
You're gonna take the walk-in?

21:46.096 --> 21:47.866
I said I'll take the walk-in.
Is that okay with you?

21:47.890 --> 21:49.284
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
- Are you sure?

21:49.308 --> 21:51.140
- You want to take the walk-in?
- No, sir.

21:51.227 --> 21:52.537
Okay, then,
I'll take the walk-in.

21:52.561 --> 21:54.848
Alice, handle the ex and then
we handle the source, okay?

21:54.939 --> 21:56.792
Can you do that for me?
Let's go. Show me the walk-in.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.696
I want a solution, okay?
Not a bunch of excuses.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.604
I'll handle
the fucking walk-in.

22:07.868 --> 22:08.868
Hey, how are you?

22:08.953 --> 22:10.113
I'm well, how are you?

22:10.162 --> 22:12.074
Excellent, thank...
Wow, that's a beautiful pin.

22:12.164 --> 22:13.558
The government is going to
seize my assets.

22:13.582 --> 22:14.914
I have $1.3 billion.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.000
That's very impressive.

22:16.085 --> 22:17.354
I know a lot of people
in America.

22:17.378 --> 22:18.209
It's beautiful.

22:18.295 --> 22:19.376
I know Warren Buffett.

22:19.463 --> 22:21.441
- You know Warren Buffett?
- Yes. Mr. Warren Buffett.

22:21.465 --> 22:23.081
I can pay whatever it takes.

22:23.175 --> 22:24.277
You're offering me
whatever it takes or...

22:24.301 --> 22:25.301
No, no, no. No, no.

22:27.680 --> 22:28.921
<i>- Hey.</i>
- Hey.

22:29.014 --> 22:30.380
I'm sorry
I missed all those calls.

22:30.474 --> 22:31.760
<i>I need to confirm</i>

22:31.851 --> 22:34.810
<i>that you are not going to be
at her school on Mother's Day.</i>

22:34.895 --> 22:36.181
You just wanted
to confirm that?

22:36.272 --> 22:37.638
<i>Correct.
Diane is gonna take her...</i>

22:37.731 --> 22:39.017
You know I can't be there.

22:39.108 --> 22:40.724
- Are you recording this?
<i>- Pardon me?</i>

22:41.318 --> 22:42.546
You know it's illegal
to record me, Luke.

22:42.570 --> 22:43.570
<i>I am just trying...</i>

22:43.654 --> 22:45.374
I'm the 17th richest person
in this country.

22:45.447 --> 22:46.608
They liquidate my accounts,

22:46.699 --> 22:48.907
my whole family is
going to be ruined.

22:48.993 --> 22:50.200
I will have nothing.

22:50.286 --> 22:51.286
Well, that's a shame.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.181
Are you familiar with
Lincoln's First Inaugural,

22:53.205 --> 22:54.616
delivered March 1861?

22:54.707 --> 22:57.370
Better angels and the bonds
of affection? No?

22:58.878 --> 23:00.063
All right. Abraham Lincoln
was from Kentucky.

23:00.087 --> 23:01.248
You ever been to Kentucky?

23:01.338 --> 23:03.233
What about Nebraska? Where
your friend Warren was born?

23:03.257 --> 23:04.257
<i>Hi, Mommy.</i>

23:05.009 --> 23:06.921
- Hey.
<i>- Look.</i>

23:07.011 --> 23:08.252
You got your ears pierced?

23:09.179 --> 23:10.179
Oh, wow.

23:10.514 --> 23:12.847
You look so grown up.
Your dad took you?

23:12.933 --> 23:14.424
<i>No, Diane took me.</i>

23:14.518 --> 23:15.725
<i>Are you coming
to Mother's Day?</i>

23:15.811 --> 23:17.768
<i>I thought you would make
blue cupcakes with me.</i>

23:17.855 --> 23:19.575
You know I can't be there.
I'm really sorry.

23:20.190 --> 23:21.293
<i>Okay, I'll save one for you.</i>

23:21.317 --> 23:22.933
You know what America
does not need?

23:23.360 --> 23:24.896
Another rich person

23:24.987 --> 23:27.024
scared about the liquidation
of her accounts.

23:27.114 --> 23:28.717
<i>- It's just earrings.</i>
- You know that I would...

23:28.741 --> 23:30.552
<i>Don't give me the attitude.
She wanted the earrings.</i>

23:30.576 --> 23:31.737
And by the way, it's not

23:31.827 --> 23:33.267
Warren Buffett anymore.
It's Buff-ay.

23:33.329 --> 23:34.991
- Ba-ffay?
- Bu-ffay.

23:35.581 --> 23:36.947
- Buff-ay?
- Buff-ay.

23:37.041 --> 23:38.810
Warren Buffett. He doesn't
live in Nebraska anymore.

23:38.834 --> 23:39.915
He lives in Paris.

23:40.002 --> 23:41.789
You need the French Embassy.

23:41.879 --> 23:42.915
You speak French?

23:43.005 --> 23:44.041
I'm the mother, Luke.

23:44.131 --> 23:45.918
<i>Oh, right. And Diane will be
the step-mother,</i>

23:46.008 --> 23:47.795
<i>and she's actually able
to be there.</i>

23:47.885 --> 23:49.645
I'm gonna give you
the personal mobile number

23:49.720 --> 23:50.881
of the French Ambassador.

23:50.971 --> 23:52.908
He's a very good friend of
mine. He's gonna hook you up.

23:52.932 --> 23:53.968
He's single, by the way.

23:54.058 --> 23:55.858
You tell him that Steve Bannon
sent you, okay?

23:55.935 --> 23:57.454
- This is his number.
- Thank you, Mr. Bannon.

23:57.478 --> 23:59.122
<i>You think you're the only one
that's out there working?</i>

23:59.146 --> 24:00.227
<i>You think it's so easy?</i>

24:00.314 --> 24:02.397
- You motherfucker.
<i>- What? I can't hear you.</i>

24:02.483 --> 24:04.440
- You motherfucker!
<i>- Bingo.</i>

24:04.526 --> 24:05.687
<i>Alice, good job.</i>

24:05.778 --> 24:07.940
<i>Welcome back to
the FamilyWizard, sweetheart.</i>

24:08.030 --> 24:09.987
- No.
<i>- Yes. You're wizard-ed.</i>

24:10.074 --> 24:11.190
- Wait.
<i>- Goodbye.</i>

24:11.283 --> 24:13.525
Tell her that I love her. No!

24:13.619 --> 24:15.155
Fucking motherfucker!

24:17.957 --> 24:19.243
Are we done here now?

24:23.253 --> 24:24.289
Let's go.

24:24.380 --> 24:26.066
<i>Sam Snel, you have a walk-in.</i>

24:26.090 --> 24:27.922
<i>Sam Snel, you have a walk-in.</i>

24:54.034 --> 24:56.117
If he's alive.

24:56.203 --> 24:59.742
in twenty-four hours...

24:59.832 --> 25:01.289
we have failed.

25:02.626 --> 25:03.770
<i>Everyone thinks</i>

25:03.794 --> 25:04.794
<i>they know everything now.</i>

25:06.046 --> 25:07.787
<i>You think you know
about election hacking?</i>

25:07.881 --> 25:10.041
<i>You think you understand
the definition of "collusion"?</i>

25:11.552 --> 25:12.588
You know nothing.

25:19.309 --> 25:21.204
<i>Last night we had
a seven-man team at the port,</i>

25:21.228 --> 25:23.039
acting on what we believed
was accurate intelligence

25:23.063 --> 25:25.146
regarding four pounds
of stolen C-139,

25:25.232 --> 25:27.519
a new form of caesium-137
radioactive powder.

25:27.609 --> 25:28.753
Just to understand
the magnitude,

25:28.777 --> 25:29.893
four pounds is enough

25:29.987 --> 25:32.525
to make six major cities
uninhabitable.

25:32.614 --> 25:34.025
We identified the container,

25:34.116 --> 25:35.802
there was nothing in it
but weapons and some fake art,

25:35.826 --> 25:38.614
all of which Doug and Sam
meticulously disassembled.

25:38.704 --> 25:40.741
No caesium was found.
The intel was bad.

25:40.831 --> 25:41.850
Whose source was it?

25:41.874 --> 25:42.955
That'd be on me, John.

25:43.042 --> 25:44.453
- Whose source?
- It's on me, John.

25:44.543 --> 25:45.729
How much
are we paying him?

25:45.753 --> 25:47.164
He didn't want money.

25:47.254 --> 25:49.086
We tried to pay him,
and he gave it away.

25:49.173 --> 25:51.381
- To who?
- Local senior citizen center.

25:52.718 --> 25:54.459
- FamilyWizard.
- What?

25:54.553 --> 25:57.011
He's been accurate on
everything else, John, 100%.

25:57.097 --> 25:58.283
And he appears driven
and motivated

25:58.307 --> 25:59.492
by something
other than funding.

25:59.516 --> 26:01.428
- Fix this.
- Oh, it's gonna be fixed.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.121
Every one of
these events occurred

26:04.146 --> 26:06.559
as a result of a failure
of imagination.

26:06.648 --> 26:10.187
Your job is not to predict
tomorrow based on yesterday.

26:10.277 --> 26:11.768
That's what academics do.

26:11.862 --> 26:14.445
Your job is to prevent
the end of tomorrow

26:15.157 --> 26:16.760
by using your brains
and your imagination.

26:16.784 --> 26:19.447
If you don't find the caesium
before it's too late,

26:19.536 --> 26:20.947
you will be held responsible

26:21.038 --> 26:23.280
for the single largest
intelligence fumble

26:23.373 --> 26:25.490
since a flight instruction
school in Florida

26:25.584 --> 26:27.120
failed to grasp
the significance

26:27.211 --> 26:30.045
of a 19-year-old
Al-Qaeda terrorist

26:30.130 --> 26:32.417
saying he didn't need to learn
how to land.

26:34.301 --> 26:35.883
So fucking wake up.

26:38.639 --> 26:41.302
Very impressive list, John.
Greatest Hits of Shit Show.

26:41.391 --> 26:44.225
You didn't give
the French Ambassador's

26:44.311 --> 26:46.769
mobile number to a walk-in?
Did you?

26:46.855 --> 26:48.062
Uh, yeah, maybe I did.

26:48.148 --> 26:52.518
I don't need phone calls from
the French Ambassador, Jimmy.

26:54.905 --> 26:56.862
- Is she all right?
- I got her.

26:56.949 --> 26:59.236
I don't need
radioactive powder discs

26:59.326 --> 27:00.988
floating around
unaccounted for.

27:01.537 --> 27:04.655
This is such shit.

27:04.748 --> 27:06.489
This is the worst fucking shit

27:06.583 --> 27:08.916
of all the fucked up shit
we've ever seen.

27:09.002 --> 27:10.868
This is the shittiest,
most fucked up shit...

27:10.963 --> 27:13.421
I got it, okay? Relax.
Calm down.

27:14.341 --> 27:16.333
- Go take a little nap.
- Fuck you.

27:16.969 --> 27:18.176
FamilyWizard?

27:18.262 --> 27:19.753
It's a divorce app.

27:19.847 --> 27:21.429
Cuts out direct communication.

27:21.515 --> 27:23.347
- It lowers conflict.
- It's working.

27:23.433 --> 27:25.299
Edits your emails,
copies them to the lawyers.

27:25.394 --> 27:26.496
It doesn't like certain words.

27:26.520 --> 27:27.520
Like what?

27:27.604 --> 27:29.971
"Prick. Whore. Cocksucker.
Male whore, sadist.

27:30.065 --> 27:31.505
"Fucking asshole,
fucking psychopath,

27:31.567 --> 27:32.794
"fucking deadbeat,
fucking idiot,

27:32.818 --> 27:33.920
"fucking parsimonious,
dictatorial,

27:33.944 --> 27:34.984
"abusive motherfucking..."

27:35.028 --> 27:37.611
I got it. You're upset,
suck it up, okay?

27:37.698 --> 27:38.800
I have no ability
to communicate

27:38.824 --> 27:39.824
with my daughter now.

27:39.908 --> 27:41.219
You're never gonna do
something normal

27:41.243 --> 27:43.030
until you die.
That's what this job is.

27:43.120 --> 27:45.181
I think I've lied to every
person that I've ever met.

27:45.205 --> 27:46.599
So what? You really
wanna get into this now?

27:46.623 --> 27:48.205
- No.
- "No," what?

27:48.292 --> 27:49.772
No to your black vision
of everything.

27:49.835 --> 27:50.951
If you can't fucking tell,

27:51.044 --> 27:52.272
I'm not in the mood
to be light-housed.

27:52.296 --> 27:54.583
This is dark work, Alice.
And you requested it.

27:54.673 --> 27:55.859
And I'm not gonna be washing
strawberry jam

27:55.883 --> 27:57.083
out of my swimsuit
this summer,

27:57.134 --> 27:58.341
I get to wash blood.

27:58.427 --> 27:59.487
Only maybe not
because they don't make

27:59.511 --> 28:00.627
a detergent for that.

28:00.721 --> 28:02.407
And you can forget about sex
on Sundays, there are no

28:02.431 --> 28:03.575
- Sundays in our world.
- None.

28:03.599 --> 28:04.784
- The job comes first.
- You said it.

28:04.808 --> 28:06.119
- You said it.
- You said it, and you've

28:06.143 --> 28:07.620
learned well. You're starting
to make me proud.

28:07.644 --> 28:09.601
- I'm not you.
- You're pretty close.

28:09.688 --> 28:10.915
Just take the fucking
medicine, Al, okay?

28:10.939 --> 28:12.139
It's halfway down your throat.

28:12.191 --> 28:13.853
- You need a vacation.
- For what?

28:16.069 --> 28:18.732
- You need a week on a beach.
- This is my beach.

28:18.822 --> 28:19.903
I love it here.

28:19.990 --> 28:21.731
There is no absolution, Al,
all right?

28:21.825 --> 28:23.612
There is no washing out
what we do.

28:23.702 --> 28:26.240
Unless, of course,
you try that Jesus guy.

28:26.330 --> 28:27.724
I mean, they say
he's very forgiving.

28:27.748 --> 28:29.142
They also say,
"Thou shall not kill."

28:29.166 --> 28:31.326
You and I have put up some
serious numbers, young lady.

28:34.129 --> 28:35.791
Fuck.

28:39.301 --> 28:40.820
We were not there
to keep the peace, all right?

28:40.844 --> 28:41.755
There was no peace.

28:41.845 --> 28:43.381
We were there
to limit the violence.

28:48.560 --> 28:49.560
Hey, get back!

28:51.104 --> 28:53.041
Sometimes that's all it takes
for a guy to take a risk.

28:53.065 --> 28:54.250
For a guy to do
the right thing.

28:54.274 --> 28:55.481
You, get back!

28:55.567 --> 28:57.687
<i>Asian male
approaching. Please advise.</i>

29:03.617 --> 29:05.324
<i>Be advised.
There's one male subject</i>

29:05.410 --> 29:06.696
<i>right at the front gate.</i>

29:12.084 --> 29:14.167
People are rarely rational.

29:14.253 --> 29:15.396
- Put it down.
- A gift.

29:15.420 --> 29:16.956
People are highly
self-destructive.

29:17.047 --> 29:18.288
On your knees.

29:18.382 --> 29:20.610
The definition of an unknown
known is a thing which exists,

29:20.634 --> 29:21.875
but which
you don't know about,

29:21.969 --> 29:23.631
and which you cannot
even imagine.

29:23.720 --> 29:24.906
Back up! End of the road!

29:24.930 --> 29:26.074
Let me see both hands.

29:26.098 --> 29:27.430
Back. Get back.

29:27.975 --> 29:29.466
Put your hands in the air.

29:30.394 --> 29:32.056
Get back!
End of the road!

29:32.145 --> 29:33.206
What the hell is that?

29:33.230 --> 29:34.266
Get back!

29:40.654 --> 29:42.486
<i>Most sources
lie right to your face.</i>

29:43.365 --> 29:44.947
When they have what you need,

29:45.033 --> 29:46.399
they know they have the power.

29:59.298 --> 30:00.630
Let's get in the air.

30:05.971 --> 30:07.712
We are about to do something...

30:09.391 --> 30:11.553
much more powerful
than kill a man.

30:13.645 --> 30:16.433
We're about to kill...

30:16.523 --> 30:19.311
the idea that...

30:19.401 --> 30:20.401
we are weak.

30:34.041 --> 30:35.077
That's my asset.

30:35.167 --> 30:36.499
- Who is he?
- Li Noor.

30:36.585 --> 30:37.687
I don't wanna know his name,

30:37.711 --> 30:39.355
I don't wanna know
what he does for a living,

30:39.379 --> 30:40.773
- I wanna know who is he?
- A loner.

30:40.797 --> 30:43.631
No kids. No family.
100% accurate and reliable.

30:43.717 --> 30:44.777
You marked him
or he marked you?

30:44.801 --> 30:45.801
I marked him.

30:45.886 --> 30:47.343
He says
he has the exact locations

30:47.429 --> 30:48.636
of all six sets of caesium.

30:48.722 --> 30:50.304
He's locked it on a disc.

30:50.390 --> 30:52.150
He says only if we get him
out of the country

30:52.225 --> 30:54.387
and give him asylum
will he open the disc.

30:54.478 --> 30:56.372
You're gonna deal with this
or you want me to handle it?

30:56.396 --> 30:57.396
I got it.

30:57.773 --> 30:58.875
This is serious, right?

30:58.899 --> 30:59.899
Oh, very.

31:16.666 --> 31:18.623
Oh, fuck.

31:18.710 --> 31:21.123
- This is an ouroborus drive.
- What the fuck is that?

31:21.213 --> 31:22.829
It means
it's gonna self-destruct.

31:22.923 --> 31:25.540
The entire program is gonna
eat itself in eight hours.

31:25.634 --> 31:27.000
It's gonna be gone.

31:27.094 --> 31:30.212
He's smart. Time is insurance,
so he gets what he wants.

31:34.267 --> 31:35.553
You fucked me.

31:36.144 --> 31:37.260
No, I didn't.

31:37.354 --> 31:38.354
You didn't?

31:40.857 --> 31:43.224
Open the disc, Li.

31:44.611 --> 31:46.193
I want out of this country

31:46.279 --> 31:47.279
now.

31:52.744 --> 31:53.905
Open the disc now.

31:54.371 --> 31:55.891
I want out of the country.

31:56.289 --> 31:57.621
The information on the disc

31:57.707 --> 32:00.245
will lead to the safe return
of the stolen caesium

32:01.086 --> 32:04.329
and to the complete political
collapse of the country.

32:05.799 --> 32:06.880
Which country?

32:08.135 --> 32:09.967
The country
you're currently sitting in.

32:10.804 --> 32:12.136
Get me out of this country.

32:12.222 --> 32:14.555
and I will give you the code
to unlock the disc.

32:14.641 --> 32:15.910
Are you under the impression

32:15.934 --> 32:17.614
that you are in a position
to make demands?

32:18.562 --> 32:21.350
I tell you what I want,
and you give it to me.

32:22.941 --> 32:26.355
Open the motherfucking disc.

32:30.449 --> 32:31.860
You're wasting time.

32:37.080 --> 32:38.662
Do you think
that because I'm a woman

32:38.748 --> 32:41.786
I'm less capable
of extreme violence?

32:45.130 --> 32:46.792
I'll go get a sledgehammer

32:48.300 --> 32:52.010
and an ice-axe
and I will fuck you up.

33:04.232 --> 33:06.565
Take a closer look
at the paintings.

33:11.406 --> 33:12.646
<i>Li was a man
of his word.</i>

33:13.116 --> 33:14.876
He gave us the exact location
of the caesium.

33:17.787 --> 33:19.387
<i>He was telling us the truth
on the crate.</i>

33:19.915 --> 33:21.267
<i>So we took him at his word
on the remaining</i>

33:21.291 --> 33:22.748
<i>caesium locations.</i>

33:23.835 --> 33:25.997
<i>Certain operations require
a level of violence</i>

33:26.087 --> 33:28.124
not palatable to most people.

33:28.215 --> 33:31.959
And certain operations require
a higher level of deniability.

33:32.052 --> 33:34.965
- This is Overwatch, John.
- Give me a moment.

33:36.723 --> 33:39.591
You and I both know this is
an Overwatch operation.

33:39.684 --> 33:42.222
What was that thing about
"unadvisedly or lightly"?

33:42.312 --> 33:43.539
Oh, some things
should not be entered

33:43.563 --> 33:44.724
into unadvisedly or lightly

33:44.814 --> 33:46.125
but reverently, discreetly
advisedly, soberly,

33:46.149 --> 33:47.509
and in the fear of God.
That thing?

33:48.109 --> 33:49.725
- Yeah.
- That's the thing.

33:55.033 --> 33:56.344
I'm not gonna authorize it,
Jimmy.

33:56.368 --> 33:57.484
But you can warm him up.

33:57.577 --> 33:59.096
- Oh, I'm gonna warm him up.
- Discreetly.

33:59.120 --> 34:00.120
Discreetly.

34:17.889 --> 34:19.755
<i>I really
don't like diplomats.</i>

34:19.849 --> 34:21.431
Diplomacy never works
once the match

34:21.518 --> 34:22.850
has been lit
to start the fire.

34:22.936 --> 34:25.178
"Oh, look at that fire.

34:25.272 --> 34:27.208
"Let's drink tea and talk
about hearts and minds."

34:27.232 --> 34:28.348
No. I don't think so.

34:34.364 --> 34:35.466
How can
I help you, gentlemen?

34:35.489 --> 34:37.322
I'm here to see
Ambassador Brady.

34:42.539 --> 34:44.371
He won't talk.
He doesn't feel safe.

34:44.456 --> 34:45.685
Oh, does he want
to go back outside?

34:45.708 --> 34:47.871
'Cause I'm not sure
he'll feel safe there either.

34:47.960 --> 34:49.371
Listen up.
We have a situation.

34:49.462 --> 34:51.190
Deputy Foreign Minister
is here. He wants the cop.

34:51.214 --> 34:52.233
So whatever you guys
are doing here,

34:52.257 --> 34:53.257
I suggest you chop-chop.

34:53.300 --> 34:54.380
Well, that makes things

34:54.467 --> 34:55.527
a little more interesting,
don't it?

34:55.552 --> 34:56.592
Do not give him up, Brady.

34:56.678 --> 34:57.905
I wasn't planning
on giving him up.

34:57.929 --> 34:59.156
You have
any other advice for me?

34:59.180 --> 35:00.341
Anything else? You sure?

35:00.432 --> 35:02.072
No, no, just making
a friendly suggestion.

35:02.142 --> 35:03.804
Thank you. You cracked it yet?

35:03.893 --> 35:05.162
I'm gonna need
a little more time.

35:05.186 --> 35:06.267
You need time?

35:06.354 --> 35:08.016
I don't have any time.

35:08.106 --> 35:10.084
Didn't they teach you anything
about caesium at Harvard?

35:10.108 --> 35:11.224
I didn't go to Harvard.

35:11.318 --> 35:12.962
You didn't graduate Harvard
with Mark Zuckerberg?

35:12.986 --> 35:14.586
Actually Mark Zuckerberg
didn't graduate.

35:14.654 --> 35:16.145
I'm not talking to you.

35:16.239 --> 35:17.466
Were you born
on second base or third?

35:17.490 --> 35:18.610
'Cause I can never remember.

35:18.658 --> 35:20.820
- I'm Scottsdale, Arizona...
- I don't give a shit.

35:20.910 --> 35:22.638
They didn't teach you anything
about caesium at MIT?

35:22.662 --> 35:23.778
I didn't go to MIT.

35:23.872 --> 35:25.766
Well, let me give you
a little science lesson then.

35:25.790 --> 35:27.907
You know what happens
when you ionize a protein?

35:28.001 --> 35:30.084
You ever read <i>Hiroshima,</i>
by John Hersey?

35:30.170 --> 35:32.753
Pulitzer Prize-winning writer,
essay on the atom bomb.

35:32.839 --> 35:34.483
'Cause John Hersey wrote about
the survivors, all right?

35:34.507 --> 35:35.693
He wrote about
how he reached out

35:35.717 --> 35:36.833
to take the hands of women

35:36.926 --> 35:38.508
in the wake
of the bombing in Japan

35:38.595 --> 35:40.257
and their skin
slipped off like gloves.

35:40.347 --> 35:41.747
And then you know
what happens next?

35:41.806 --> 35:43.468
Your kidneys fail.
Your lungs collapse.

35:43.558 --> 35:45.015
You cannot breathe,
you cannot think.

35:45.101 --> 35:47.263
Your thyroid just evaporates,
all right?

35:47.354 --> 35:49.391
Then your lymphocyte
cell count takes a nose dive.

35:49.481 --> 35:50.562
Jimmy.

35:50.649 --> 35:52.126
We're looking at approximately
60,000 people

35:52.150 --> 35:53.586
becoming Jell-O
on our watch, all right?

35:53.610 --> 35:54.896
That's what this shit does.

35:54.986 --> 35:58.445
Caesium-139 is Hiroshima
and Nagasaki combined.

35:58.531 --> 35:59.567
Only you don't need

35:59.658 --> 36:00.718
sophisticated planes
to place it.

36:00.742 --> 36:01.983
You only need a kid

36:02.077 --> 36:03.637
who can empty an envelope
on a sidewalk.

36:07.666 --> 36:09.999
Do your job
and crack the code.

36:11.836 --> 36:12.855
You know,
I think I'll go meet

36:12.879 --> 36:14.119
the new
Deputy Foreign Minister.

36:25.475 --> 36:28.468
What exactly is Silva's
psychological problem?

36:28.561 --> 36:30.518
He doesn't like
computer people.

36:31.648 --> 36:32.980
Fuckin' nerds.

36:42.742 --> 36:43.742
He's in the embassy.

36:45.578 --> 36:46.578
Alive?

36:48.081 --> 36:49.081
Alive.

37:00.677 --> 37:01.677
What is your name?

37:03.430 --> 37:04.430
Li Noor.

37:05.056 --> 37:07.673
- Repeat after me. Blue.
- Blue.

37:08.476 --> 37:10.388
- Strange.
- Strange.

37:10.478 --> 37:11.889
- Coffee.
- Coffee.

37:12.480 --> 37:13.812
- Egg.
- Egg.

37:13.898 --> 37:15.626
Do you know what it feels like
to fall in love?

37:15.650 --> 37:16.515
Dangerous.

37:16.609 --> 37:18.003
What does it feel like
to kill a man?

37:18.027 --> 37:19.027
Nothing.

37:19.779 --> 37:22.943
- Repeat after me. Green.
- Green.

37:23.408 --> 37:24.524
- White.
- White.

37:25.034 --> 37:26.262
Are you an agent
of the Israeli government?

37:26.286 --> 37:27.286
No.

37:27.370 --> 37:28.848
Are you an agent of
the Pakistani government?

37:28.872 --> 37:29.872
No.

37:29.956 --> 37:31.142
Are you involved
in acts of espionage

37:31.166 --> 37:32.286
against your own government?

37:32.375 --> 37:33.436
Yes.

37:33.460 --> 37:35.167
Do you possess the code
to open the disc?

37:35.253 --> 37:36.253
Yes.

37:36.337 --> 37:37.578
Can we trust you?

37:39.924 --> 37:40.924
Yes.

37:41.009 --> 37:42.090
- Romeo.
- Romeo.

37:42.177 --> 37:43.338
- Juliet.
- Juliet.

37:44.554 --> 37:47.388
- Where is that code?
- In my mind.

37:49.058 --> 37:51.345
If transported
to the United States,

37:51.436 --> 37:52.643
will you open it?

37:55.356 --> 37:56.356
Yes.

38:21.674 --> 38:23.882
Two cups of sugar.

38:23.968 --> 38:25.880
And a cup
of blueberries, you...

38:27.180 --> 38:29.422
Shit!

38:39.859 --> 38:40.961
<i>So here's the thing...</i>

38:40.985 --> 38:44.228
We take our request for asylum
extremely seriously.

38:44.322 --> 38:45.403
If you have him, Brady,

38:45.490 --> 38:46.981
we'd like him back.
That's all.

38:47.075 --> 38:48.486
He's wanted for espionage.

38:48.576 --> 38:49.783
- Espionage?
- Yes.

38:49.869 --> 38:51.861
- What do you mean?
- How's everybody doing?

38:52.789 --> 38:54.997
If you have him, we would
very much like him back.

38:55.083 --> 38:56.244
Somebody lose a dog?

38:57.752 --> 38:58.752
Fuck!

39:02.882 --> 39:04.123
You good?

39:04.217 --> 39:05.217
Yes.

39:17.647 --> 39:19.764
Any last words for your mother?

39:22.151 --> 39:23.151
What?

39:23.236 --> 39:24.236
Traitor.

40:10.325 --> 40:11.566
He's crying wolf.

40:12.368 --> 40:13.449
He's a witch.

40:13.536 --> 40:15.536
A witch? What, like a good
witch or a wicked witch?

40:15.622 --> 40:17.784
Like a witch with a big nose
and a broom?

40:17.874 --> 40:19.911
Axel, this is
a friendly meeting.

40:20.001 --> 40:22.709
We're talking about a corrupt,
low-level cop.

40:22.795 --> 40:24.457
I think the fact
that you're sitting here

40:24.547 --> 40:26.129
indicates he's not
so low level.

41:43.334 --> 41:44.937
I can assure you
that the appropriate choice

41:44.961 --> 41:46.077
is to hand him over.

41:46.170 --> 41:47.170
You assure me?

41:47.255 --> 41:48.791
I mean, can you assure me
that those

41:48.881 --> 41:50.543
circling helicopters
are in our airspace

41:50.633 --> 41:52.169
for a cop not worth my time?

41:52.260 --> 41:53.296
- Jimmy...
- Do you know

41:53.386 --> 41:54.422
how airspace works?

41:54.512 --> 41:55.552
Do you know there's, like,

41:55.596 --> 41:56.824
a silo that goes up
from this building

41:56.848 --> 41:58.180
all the way up to Heaven?

41:58.266 --> 41:59.632
You send choppers
into that silo,

41:59.726 --> 42:01.766
you're in violation, speaking
of what's appropriate.

42:01.811 --> 42:03.052
Jimmy...

42:03.146 --> 42:04.986
I'm just stating the facts.

42:05.481 --> 42:06.481
This is Brady.

42:06.524 --> 42:07.560
Be careful.

42:07.650 --> 42:09.562
Oh, you fucking be careful.

42:09.652 --> 42:11.422
Where were they found?

42:11.446 --> 42:12.778
Is the situation contained?

42:12.864 --> 42:15.231
You should trust me, James.
It's good for your health.

42:16.909 --> 42:18.616
Do you have men
wandering our embassy?

42:18.703 --> 42:20.114
- Absolutely not.
- Good.

42:20.204 --> 42:21.536
Because the men
who were wandering

42:21.622 --> 42:23.454
the embassy
are now absolutely dead.

42:24.042 --> 42:25.042
Let's go.

42:40.892 --> 42:41.892
Get up!

42:45.104 --> 42:46.470
Hands behind your head!

42:48.107 --> 42:49.643
Hands behind your head!

42:51.402 --> 42:52.402
Turn around!

43:02.538 --> 43:04.120
About the fog of war
and imagine chaos

43:04.207 --> 43:06.449
on a battlefield.
Armies. Tanks. Smoke. Fire.

43:06.542 --> 43:08.704
But it depends on your
definition of battlefield.

43:08.795 --> 43:10.755
A battlefield can be
a room with two people in it.

43:10.797 --> 43:12.254
That's chaos. That's fog.

43:19.806 --> 43:21.092
The assassination attempt

43:21.182 --> 43:25.347
<i>meant that Li had to be
a very high-value asset.</i>

43:25.436 --> 43:27.644
Or a direct threat to them.

43:29.482 --> 43:31.519
Prepare my resignation papers.

43:33.611 --> 43:35.978
Either way,
we had to protect him.

43:38.658 --> 43:41.025
<i>Warriors don't wear uniforms
anymore.</i>

43:42.453 --> 43:44.319
<i>There are no uniforms
in war now.</i>

43:44.413 --> 43:45.516
<i>The little girl
that looks like</i>

43:45.540 --> 43:46.934
<i>your little sister's
hippie friend on holiday</i>

43:46.958 --> 43:48.540
<i>might be a weapon of
mass destruction.</i>

43:50.753 --> 43:52.085
<i>The start of
an operation is just</i>

43:52.171 --> 43:53.457
<i>like the start of
anything else.</i>

43:53.548 --> 43:55.628
<i>Everything could go right.
Everything could go wrong.</i>

43:57.802 --> 44:01.671
<i>Diplomacy is option one.
Military's option two.</i>

44:01.764 --> 44:03.630
<i>When option one and option two
are abandoned,</i>

44:03.724 --> 44:04.931
<i>there is only one thing left.</i>

44:06.477 --> 44:07.558
Which is us.

44:08.020 --> 44:09.386
We are the third option.

44:17.572 --> 44:20.030
<i>Special situations teams.
Special missions units.</i>

44:20.116 --> 44:22.449
<i>Smart people on short notice
to solve problems.</i>

44:24.412 --> 44:26.574
<i>The two teams,
they are by design</i>

44:26.664 --> 44:28.701
<i>2,000 miles from one another.</i>

44:30.126 --> 44:31.537
<i>The Overwatch location</i>

44:31.627 --> 44:34.085
<i>is America's most closely
guarded secret.</i>

44:45.725 --> 44:46.761
Mmm-hmm.

44:48.186 --> 44:50.143
How does it work?

44:50.229 --> 44:52.095
As soon as he's on the move,

44:52.190 --> 44:53.977
They'll switch networks.

44:54.066 --> 44:55.432
That's the loophole,

44:55.526 --> 44:56.812
that's our way in.

44:58.362 --> 44:59.978
An op is a living thing.

45:00.072 --> 45:03.236
Once you launch,
the op has a life of its own.

45:03.326 --> 45:04.803
- Sam, what's the op?
- It's classified.

45:04.827 --> 45:06.096
- The op is classified?
- Correct.

45:06.120 --> 45:07.181
Sam, we don't need
the attitude.

45:07.205 --> 45:08.223
You know what, Sam?
Your attitude

45:08.247 --> 45:09.658
is turning
into a real problem.

45:09.749 --> 45:10.934
You know what?
I'll go work on it

45:10.958 --> 45:12.558
after you go fuck yourself.
Okay, Victor?

45:14.962 --> 45:19.252
This is a Title 50
Overwatch operation.

45:19.342 --> 45:21.459
Overwatch protocols
will be in effect

45:21.552 --> 45:23.794
for the next 180 minutes.

45:25.765 --> 45:29.133
The package is Li Noor.

45:29.602 --> 45:33.095
He spent seven years
in our host country's

45:33.189 --> 45:34.976
elite tactical squad.

45:35.066 --> 45:37.353
He has no known family.

45:38.027 --> 45:42.522
The goal is to deliver
that package from here,

45:42.615 --> 45:45.608
22 miles to our Angel.

45:45.701 --> 45:48.444
Nine pounds of
radioactive isotope,

45:48.537 --> 45:51.280
otherwise known as
caesium-139,

45:51.374 --> 45:54.833
otherwise known as
Fear Powder is missing.

45:56.420 --> 45:59.834
<i>Mr. Noor knows
exactly where it is.</i>

45:59.924 --> 46:03.258
<i>He has locked the information
on a disc,</i>

46:03.344 --> 46:06.633
and it is deconstructing
even as we speak.

46:06.722 --> 46:10.511
<i>He wants asylum.
He wants America.</i>

46:11.269 --> 46:13.261
Only when we get him
to the plane

46:15.022 --> 46:17.981
will he give us the code
to unlock the disc.

46:19.277 --> 46:21.815
<i>She can only stay on
the ground ten minutes.</i>

46:21.904 --> 46:24.146
So we are extremely limited.

46:24.240 --> 46:25.856
<i>Speed matters.</i>

46:31.122 --> 46:33.785
<i>We have a team of
seven operators.</i>

46:36.460 --> 46:40.249
<i>They are no longer employees
of the US government.</i>

46:42.049 --> 46:45.417
<i>They are engaged in
a higher form of patriotism.</i>

46:47.847 --> 46:49.588
They are ghosts.

47:12.997 --> 47:14.488
You're not a witch, are you?

47:16.042 --> 47:17.042
No.

47:19.003 --> 47:20.003
Are you?

47:52.995 --> 47:55.738
Prepare for
net changeover. Ready.

47:55.831 --> 47:57.197
And in five,

47:57.291 --> 47:58.827
<i>four,</i>

47:59.543 --> 48:00.909
...three, two...

48:01.003 --> 48:02.003
...one.

48:05.007 --> 48:08.216
<i>Child-One, Mother.
We are active on new comms.</i>

48:08.886 --> 48:10.002
Ok, lock in.

48:10.513 --> 48:11.656
<i>Do I believe
in Santa Claus?</i>

48:11.680 --> 48:12.680
<i>No.</i>

48:13.432 --> 48:14.432
<i>Tooth fairy?</i>

48:14.683 --> 48:15.764
Uh-uh.

48:15.851 --> 48:17.934
Did I believe that
my three ex-wives meant it

48:18.020 --> 48:19.700
when they said that
they'd love me forever?

48:19.730 --> 48:21.346
Absolutely fucking not.

48:21.440 --> 48:24.057
<i>Did I believe that the comms
were secure? Yes.</i>

48:26.946 --> 48:28.062
We all did.

48:28.155 --> 48:30.568
- Hello, my old friend.
<i>- Yes, Mother. All good.</i>

48:30.658 --> 48:31.865
Do you have your sneakers on?

48:33.244 --> 48:34.451
Good to go.

48:34.912 --> 48:36.073
Let's take a drive.

48:54.640 --> 48:56.802
<i>Angel to Mother.
We are wheels up.</i>

48:56.892 --> 48:58.599
<i>Twenty-seven mikes to LC.</i>

48:58.686 --> 49:00.518
<i>We'll be yo-yo
for the next 27 minutes.</i>

49:16.245 --> 49:17.361
So you're telling me

49:17.455 --> 49:18.640
you really wanna bring down
this government?

49:18.664 --> 49:20.784
Why don't you give me the
codes, save us some trouble?

49:20.875 --> 49:21.875
No.

49:23.169 --> 49:26.753
Anonymity is a hard concept
for most coders to grasp

49:26.839 --> 49:29.673
because it's a hard concept
for most men to grasp.

49:30.384 --> 49:31.716
Most coders are men.

49:32.761 --> 49:35.424
This was definitely written
by a woman.

49:35.514 --> 49:37.242
<i>Our friend
here has a little bit of</i>

49:37.266 --> 49:39.053
<i>an ego. Changes ideology...</i>

49:41.687 --> 49:42.998
Do you know
why people commit espionage

49:43.022 --> 49:44.263
against their own government?

49:44.356 --> 49:45.542
It's mainly money,
right, Dougie?

49:45.566 --> 49:46.668
That's been
my experience, yeah.

49:46.692 --> 49:48.336
So if you're not into money,
which I hear you're not.

49:48.360 --> 49:49.146
- Is that correct, Alice?
- Right.

49:49.236 --> 49:50.272
And it's not ideology,

49:50.362 --> 49:51.465
and nobody's forcing you
to do this.

49:51.489 --> 49:53.276
There can only be
one possible exception.

49:54.074 --> 49:55.074
You've got a big ego.

49:55.493 --> 49:56.493
It's not ego.

49:56.577 --> 49:58.113
It's everybody's downfall,
my friend.

49:58.204 --> 49:59.740
Ego is not your <i>amigo.</i>

49:59.830 --> 50:01.710
I'm gonna find out
what bitch wrote this script.

50:04.585 --> 50:07.453
Change one number,
change the idea.

50:10.716 --> 50:12.068
The package
will be received

50:12.092 --> 50:13.378
in Ramstein, Germany.

50:13.469 --> 50:15.071
- You don't know me.
- No, I don't know you.

50:15.095 --> 50:16.495
This government
destroyed my family.

50:17.973 --> 50:19.009
Oh.

50:19.975 --> 50:21.216
When that shit goes down,

50:21.310 --> 50:22.390
if you can't go
to a grocery

50:22.436 --> 50:23.497
'cause nothing's refrigerated,

50:23.521 --> 50:24.623
where are you gonna
get your milk?

50:24.647 --> 50:26.104
No. It's a very
lucrative business.

50:26.190 --> 50:27.459
If you get yourself
the Ferrari of goats,

50:27.483 --> 50:28.690
it's pretty expensive.

50:28.776 --> 50:30.776
You wanna text me a link
when we're done with this?

50:32.112 --> 50:33.840
Check out
how calm Meditation Mike is.

50:33.864 --> 50:35.759
- You feeling calm, Alice?
- Not even a little bit.

50:35.783 --> 50:37.399
- Are you?
- I'm totally calm.

50:37.493 --> 50:39.053
That's because
you're mentally unstable.

50:39.078 --> 50:40.078
Thank you.

50:40.663 --> 50:41.904
<i>Mother, Child-One.</i>

50:42.706 --> 50:44.351
Starting to slow down here.
You got another route for us?

50:44.375 --> 50:46.207
Yeah, there's
an incident on this route

50:46.293 --> 50:47.625
three blocks ahead.

50:48.045 --> 50:49.081
Rerouting now.

50:49.171 --> 50:50.649
Want me to clear out
some of this traffic?

50:50.673 --> 50:51.858
I could pick 'em off, sir.
Clear...

50:51.882 --> 50:52.292
Maybe later.

50:52.383 --> 50:53.419
How's Angel?

50:53.509 --> 50:54.736
We're green
across the board, sir.

50:54.760 --> 50:55.921
Cruising at 40,000 feet.

50:56.011 --> 50:57.877
Child-One,
switching to alternate route.

50:59.306 --> 51:00.867
Take your next right,
and we'll green-light you

51:00.891 --> 51:02.331
through the next
three intersections.

51:07.273 --> 51:09.560
- Slow your roll...
- All this Snapchattin',

51:09.650 --> 51:12.484
Facebookin', and bookin'
a face and Instagrammin', sir.

51:12.570 --> 51:13.902
Pick up a goddamn book.

51:15.573 --> 51:16.573
Green.

51:19.493 --> 51:20.654
<i>Two, one.</i>

51:26.500 --> 51:28.207
<i>You're approaching a "Y".</i>

51:28.294 --> 51:29.876
<i>Bear left on the "Y".</i>

51:32.798 --> 51:33.879
<i>Mother, Child-One.</i>

51:35.092 --> 51:36.972
Mother, Child-One.
Nice job on the green lights.

51:39.638 --> 51:41.470
<i>Make...
Make a left.</i>

51:43.267 --> 51:47.386
<i>Seeing additional traffic.
See if we could open that up.</i>

52:01.368 --> 52:02.688
Bishop,
I've got seven motorcycles

52:02.745 --> 52:03.826
approaching quickly.

52:04.246 --> 52:05.327
They got bikes, Dougie.

52:05.414 --> 52:06.414
I see 'em.

52:07.875 --> 52:09.036
<i>The fuck is that?</i>

52:09.126 --> 52:10.846
<i>Dougie, Dougie,
get right, get right!</i>

52:18.677 --> 52:19.918
Where'd that come from?

52:20.012 --> 52:21.128
Fuck!

52:21.221 --> 52:23.033
<i>- Watch that motorcycles.
- On your left!</i>

52:23.057 --> 52:24.468
- Dougie, get right!
- Get right!

52:27.686 --> 52:29.018
Where's the signal?

52:32.358 --> 52:33.599
Child-One, Mother.

52:33.692 --> 52:34.692
<i>Status?</i>

52:39.490 --> 52:40.571
<i>Mother, Child-One.</i>

52:40.658 --> 52:42.260
<i>Looks like the threats
are breaking contact.</i>

52:42.284 --> 52:44.116
Check the tape.
What'd we miss?

52:44.203 --> 52:45.865
Rewinding footage.

52:51.960 --> 52:53.076
Bishop?

53:01.220 --> 53:02.405
This motorcycle's
placed something

53:02.429 --> 53:03.509
on the side of the vehicle.

53:12.856 --> 53:15.724
Base, Bretsky,
Reed, KIA.

53:21.573 --> 53:23.253
Mother, Child-One,
contact, contact.

53:23.325 --> 53:24.441
Vehicle is down hard.

53:35.337 --> 53:36.898
<i>Mother, we're
surrounded, need help.</i>

53:36.922 --> 53:38.629
<i>Multiple hostiles
behind vehicles.</i>

53:39.341 --> 53:40.377
Alice, go!

53:43.053 --> 53:44.134
Back up, back up, back up!

53:44.221 --> 53:46.221
Mother, Child-One. We're
in contact. Major contact.

54:00.154 --> 54:01.611
<i>Child-One, Mother.</i>

54:01.697 --> 54:03.689
<i>What is the status
of the package?</i>

54:03.782 --> 54:05.648
Mother,
we have the package.

54:05.743 --> 54:07.325
The car's down hard.
We're evacing now.

54:08.662 --> 54:09.662
Sam, get cover.

54:21.717 --> 54:23.549
Mother, Child-One.
We need a new car.

54:24.511 --> 54:25.511
On it.

54:25.596 --> 54:27.212
They're gonna need
another route.

54:27.306 --> 54:28.826
- Big eye, what do you see?
- Yes, sir.

54:40.402 --> 54:41.402
Fuck!

54:45.240 --> 54:46.240
Breathe.

54:47.826 --> 54:50.318
Scan all local
law enforcement.

54:50.412 --> 54:52.244
I need to know
how much time we have.

54:56.210 --> 54:57.291
This car looks good.

54:57.377 --> 54:58.913
Child-One, gray BMW,

54:59.004 --> 55:00.916
about 20 meters
in front of you.

55:03.091 --> 55:05.754
Dougie, gray BMW,
20 meters, one o'clock.

55:06.428 --> 55:07.428
- Yes.
- Get it.

55:11.225 --> 55:12.557
<i>Dougie, keep your 12.</i>

55:12.643 --> 55:14.523
I'mma flank the fuck
out of these motherfuckers.

55:16.980 --> 55:18.562
<i>Stay with the package.</i>

55:42.506 --> 55:43.506
Fuck!

55:44.675 --> 55:45.835
Ready?

55:46.510 --> 55:48.046
Go! We're getting
out of here now!

55:52.766 --> 55:54.098
Where'd that
come from?

55:55.143 --> 55:56.304
Silva!

55:59.690 --> 56:00.897
Threat, one o'clock.

56:00.983 --> 56:03.020
<i>Blue jacket, magazine stand,
grenade launcher.</i>

56:12.327 --> 56:13.534
Two threats advancing towards

56:13.620 --> 56:14.806
<i>the package
from the right side.</i>

56:19.293 --> 56:20.893
<i>Child-One,
stay with the package.</i>

56:26.383 --> 56:28.420
Child-One,
cover the package.

56:49.072 --> 56:50.483
BMW, now. Go!

56:56.413 --> 56:57.494
Look at me.

57:03.378 --> 57:04.378
I'm done.

57:05.589 --> 57:06.589
You did good.

57:08.383 --> 57:09.624
Child-One, get out.

57:09.718 --> 57:10.799
<i>Now.</i>

57:29.279 --> 57:31.236
Go, go, go.

58:05.440 --> 58:06.751
What the hell
happened back there?

58:06.775 --> 58:08.169
Our car is made.
We need a safe house.

58:08.193 --> 58:09.559
We need to
regroup immediately.

58:10.487 --> 58:11.227
No!

58:11.321 --> 58:12.321
Not a safe house!

58:12.364 --> 58:13.364
How far is it?

58:13.865 --> 58:14.776
2.3 miles ahead.

58:14.866 --> 58:16.052
Is this your idea
of justice, huh?

58:16.076 --> 58:16.941
Shut your mouth!

58:17.035 --> 58:17.900
Take me to the airport.

58:17.995 --> 58:18.826
Is it secure?

58:18.912 --> 58:19.973
I had three hours
to vet the place.

58:19.997 --> 58:22.410
Fuck vetting.
I don't wanna hear vetting!

58:22.499 --> 58:24.035
Is it secure?

58:24.126 --> 58:25.333
You know what?
I want the code.

58:25.419 --> 58:26.646
And I want the code now!

58:26.670 --> 58:27.897
I don't give a shit
about your family.

58:27.921 --> 58:30.004
I don't give a fuck
if you had three hours.

58:30.090 --> 58:31.831
I take you, and I throw you
out the side...

58:31.925 --> 58:34.383
Yes, with high confidence,
it's secure.

58:34.469 --> 58:36.677
See? That's all I needed.
High degree of confidence.

58:37.806 --> 58:39.450
Just take me to the airport.
I'll give you what you want.

58:39.474 --> 58:41.056
<i>Take the next
two rights.</i>

58:46.523 --> 58:47.523
<i>Take the next left.</i>

58:49.526 --> 58:52.860
2-1-4-7-2 is your intro.

58:52.946 --> 58:54.778
<i>Third garage on the right.</i>

58:56.324 --> 58:58.657
- 214.
- 72.

59:13.008 --> 59:14.465
<i>Entering the den...</i>

59:15.677 --> 59:16.917
<i>Getting in the networks.</i>

59:18.805 --> 59:20.012
<i>Visuals up.</i>

59:22.392 --> 59:26.181
<i>Contact is bald, male,
48 years old, blue shirt.</i>

59:36.573 --> 59:37.893
This is everything
they asked for.

59:48.085 --> 59:49.701
<i>Examining for
possible threats.</i>

59:53.715 --> 59:55.395
<i>Do you have
any identifiable threats,</i>

59:55.425 --> 59:57.132
<i>weapons? Any hostiles?</i>

59:57.219 --> 59:58.529
<i>No anomalous
behavior detected.</i>

59:58.553 --> 01:00:00.545
<i>Clean vehicle
will be there in six.</i>

01:00:00.639 --> 01:00:02.631
<i>Clean vehicle
will be there in six.</i>

01:00:03.725 --> 01:00:05.808
We're identifying the city.

01:00:10.982 --> 01:00:12.814
<i>Noor files downloaded.</i>

01:00:12.901 --> 01:00:15.939
Looks like maybe a study
abroad during university.

01:00:16.029 --> 01:00:17.816
Why would that be redacted?

01:00:20.575 --> 01:00:22.111
<i>We need all police to</i>

01:00:22.202 --> 01:00:23.738
<i>clear out
the West Papua district.</i>

01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:25.223
<i>Be advised.
Police are being ordered</i>

01:00:25.247 --> 01:00:27.284
<i>to clear out of the area.</i>

01:00:38.593 --> 01:00:39.793
Let's get ready
to move.

01:00:44.724 --> 01:00:47.762
Jimmy, we don't leave
the reservation.

01:00:49.437 --> 01:00:50.498
<i>We've got
armed motorcyclist...</i>

01:00:50.522 --> 01:00:53.356
<i>Armed motorcycles
on either side</i>

01:00:53.441 --> 01:00:55.023
<i>of the entrance to the bakery.</i>

01:00:55.902 --> 01:00:57.422
<i>Angel, Knight.
Unexpected delay.</i>

01:00:57.487 --> 01:00:59.444
<i>Get the fuck
out of there.</i>

01:01:00.615 --> 01:01:02.455
Attack on an American officer
is an act of war.

01:01:02.993 --> 01:01:04.359
I need him back right now.

01:01:04.452 --> 01:01:06.239
Let me give you some advice.

01:01:06.329 --> 01:01:07.329
You ready?

01:01:07.414 --> 01:01:08.414
Stop.

01:01:09.332 --> 01:01:10.332
You hear me?

01:01:10.792 --> 01:01:11.792
Stop.

01:01:11.877 --> 01:01:13.834
This is nothing personal, man.

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:15.760
- I'm just doing my job.
- I'm just doing mine.

01:01:15.797 --> 01:01:17.191
Sir, I got the scope
on the man.

01:01:17.215 --> 01:01:18.359
You want me to take the shot?

01:01:18.383 --> 01:01:19.383
No.

01:01:19.759 --> 01:01:20.759
Please, sir?

01:01:20.802 --> 01:01:22.043
I heard there was a little

01:01:22.137 --> 01:01:23.489
unfortunate incident
on the highway.

01:01:23.513 --> 01:01:24.924
A little incident?

01:01:25.015 --> 01:01:26.756
I would really hate for it
to happen again.

01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:28.341
Are you threatening me?

01:01:28.435 --> 01:01:29.871
We can do this
however you wanna do it.

01:01:29.895 --> 01:01:31.664
You gonna keep coming at me
until you kill us all?

01:01:31.688 --> 01:01:32.769
Yeah.

01:01:32.856 --> 01:01:35.223
That's a weird fucking game,
but okay, I'll play.

01:01:35.317 --> 01:01:36.933
I mean, you have
home court advantage.

01:01:37.027 --> 01:01:38.188
You have a larger team,

01:01:38.278 --> 01:01:39.894
unlimited resources
due to the support of

01:01:39.988 --> 01:01:41.650
a phenomenally
corrupt government

01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:43.050
willing to kill
innocent citizens.

01:01:43.074 --> 01:01:44.736
Plus, a local
special forces which

01:01:44.826 --> 01:01:47.284
we designed and trained
and built for you.

01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:50.488
Stop monologuing,
you bipolar fuck.

01:01:50.582 --> 01:01:51.993
I think he's more
manic-depressed.

01:01:52.083 --> 01:01:53.415
Or narcissistic disorder.

01:01:53.501 --> 01:01:55.313
- Dissociative disorder.
- He's just an asshole.

01:01:55.337 --> 01:01:56.623
And let's not forget
about your

01:01:56.713 --> 01:01:57.999
absolutely medieval
moral compass

01:01:58.089 --> 01:01:59.705
and nasty thirst for bloodshed

01:01:59.799 --> 01:02:01.027
for which there has been
no legal repercussion

01:02:01.051 --> 01:02:03.168
because you do not operate
under any rule of law.

01:02:03.845 --> 01:02:04.845
Chaos.

01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:06.282
- That's right, Jimmy.
- Yeah, but you know what?

01:02:06.306 --> 01:02:07.422
What's that, Jimmy?

01:02:07.515 --> 01:02:09.035
I think I might just be
a little worse.

01:02:10.435 --> 01:02:12.927
<i>Child-One, Mother,
move the package now.</i>

01:02:15.523 --> 01:02:17.230
Get him in the car now.
Let's go.

01:02:18.026 --> 01:02:19.026
Let's go.

01:02:27.202 --> 01:02:28.784
Bomb! Get down now!

01:02:44.469 --> 01:02:46.586
Child-One, Mother.
Status, please.

01:03:07.367 --> 01:03:08.367
Shit.

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:10.560
- Anywhere else?
- I don't think so.

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:18.460
Let's go.

01:03:33.143 --> 01:03:34.179
In the fucking car, now!

01:03:34.269 --> 01:03:35.269
Let's go.

01:03:50.076 --> 01:03:51.942
<i>Child-One, gunmen.</i>

01:03:55.123 --> 01:03:56.409
Go. Move!

01:03:58.418 --> 01:03:59.418
I've got package in tow.

01:04:09.346 --> 01:04:10.507
Okay.

01:04:18.730 --> 01:04:19.730
Alice, status?

01:04:19.814 --> 01:04:20.814
He is fine.

01:04:22.776 --> 01:04:23.836
Come on, Dougie.
Get your shit together.

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:25.171
He is fine. You just keep
fuckin' driving.

01:04:25.195 --> 01:04:26.595
You pull this shit
on me now?

01:04:27.155 --> 01:04:29.363
<i>Mother, package in tow.
We have one critical.</i>

01:04:29.449 --> 01:04:31.065
We need a new vehicle ASAP.

01:04:31.159 --> 01:04:32.366
What's the ETA on the plane?

01:04:32.452 --> 01:04:34.444
- Twenty-two minutes.
- How many miles out are we?

01:04:34.537 --> 01:04:36.449
- Twelve.
- Child-One, no time.

01:04:36.539 --> 01:04:38.496
Get your ass
to the airstrip now.

01:04:38.583 --> 01:04:39.583
Copy, Mother.

01:04:57.435 --> 01:04:59.195
- Go, go!
- Spread out, spread out!

01:05:05.235 --> 01:05:06.555
Get him in the building
behind us.

01:05:11.783 --> 01:05:13.240
Get out of my face.

01:05:14.077 --> 01:05:15.077
Go.

01:05:19.624 --> 01:05:20.624
Now.

01:05:25.797 --> 01:05:27.038
I got you. Yeah.

01:05:29.384 --> 01:05:30.465
You've got it?

01:05:30.552 --> 01:05:32.088
Paradise Apartment Complex.

01:05:34.055 --> 01:05:35.762
I got you. I got you.

01:05:53.491 --> 01:05:54.691
Oh, you give 'em hell, Dougie.

01:05:55.452 --> 01:05:57.114
You just get him
to the airport.

01:05:58.955 --> 01:06:01.038
I will. All right, brother.

01:06:14.846 --> 01:06:20.592
Every normal man must be
tempted at times

01:06:20.685 --> 01:06:24.474
<i>- to spit upon his hands...
- Alice!</i>

01:06:24.564 --> 01:06:26.055
...hoist the black flag...

01:06:26.149 --> 01:06:27.606
<i>Silva,
you better be moving.</i>

01:06:27.692 --> 01:06:30.150
...and begin slitting throats.

01:07:36.219 --> 01:07:37.426
Fuck.

01:07:44.269 --> 01:07:45.805
- We got a car?
- I do.

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:50.476
Mother, Child-One.

01:07:50.567 --> 01:07:52.169
You gotta get us
the way out of here ASAP.

01:07:52.193 --> 01:07:53.629
Child-One,
working on extraction point.

01:07:53.653 --> 01:07:55.315
<i>Get to the south staircase.</i>

01:07:55.405 --> 01:07:56.816
Alice, this way.

01:07:56.906 --> 01:07:59.865
<i>I repeat.
Get to the south staircase.</i>

01:07:59.951 --> 01:08:01.613
<i>Copy that.
Heading south.</i>

01:08:21.930 --> 01:08:22.930
Sir, I've got eyes.

01:08:28.395 --> 01:08:29.395
Come on.

01:08:49.626 --> 01:08:50.894
<i>Mother,
we are on the fourth level.</i>

01:08:50.917 --> 01:08:51.783
<i>What's the route?</i>

01:08:51.877 --> 01:08:53.288
<i>How the fuck
do I get out of here?</i>

01:08:54.714 --> 01:08:57.377
Extraction point is at the end
of the second hallway,

01:08:57.466 --> 01:08:59.174
<i>coming up on your right.</i>

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:12.645
<i>Child-One, exit is 20 yards
in front of you. R-447.</i>

01:09:14.942 --> 01:09:16.854
<i>That'll take you
to the extraction point</i>

01:09:16.944 --> 01:09:18.731
<i>in the rear courtyard.</i>

01:09:18.821 --> 01:09:20.983
Shit! Back up,
back up, back up!

01:09:25.703 --> 01:09:26.703
Go.

01:09:33.961 --> 01:09:34.961
Fuck!

01:09:44.389 --> 01:09:45.720
Move, move. Back up!

01:09:56.359 --> 01:09:57.566
Back up, back up. Now!

01:10:01.155 --> 01:10:02.771
They're separated.

01:10:06.911 --> 01:10:07.911
Fuck!

01:10:11.666 --> 01:10:12.666
Jimmy, do you copy?

01:10:13.751 --> 01:10:14.958
Jimmy, do you copy?

01:10:24.262 --> 01:10:25.572
Mother,
I have the package.

01:10:25.596 --> 01:10:27.007
<i>Do you have eyes on Alice?</i>

01:10:29.559 --> 01:10:31.425
<i>- Mother?</i>
- Negative.

01:10:31.519 --> 01:10:32.726
Mother, Child-One, reroute us.

01:10:32.812 --> 01:10:36.180
The route out is directly
behind you. Take it.

01:10:36.274 --> 01:10:39.608
<i>Stairwell, Romeo-445.</i>

01:10:48.703 --> 01:10:52.788
- No.
- Child-One, no what?

01:10:52.874 --> 01:10:56.493
No! I'm want a route to Alice.
Reroute me to Alice now.

01:10:59.046 --> 01:11:01.629
<i>It's before Bingo Fuel.
Where's the package?</i>

01:11:01.716 --> 01:11:02.836
Ten minutes. We're counting.

01:11:03.634 --> 01:11:05.626
Child-One, it's time.

01:11:10.349 --> 01:11:12.035
You understand a little girl
who calls her mother every day

01:11:12.059 --> 01:11:13.095
because she misses her?

01:11:13.186 --> 01:11:14.705
Because her mother is not home
with her?

01:11:14.729 --> 01:11:15.810
She's here with you.

01:11:15.897 --> 01:11:17.763
She is here for you.

01:11:33.664 --> 01:11:35.451
Option one,
open the disc and end this.

01:11:35.541 --> 01:11:36.541
Exit.

01:11:36.626 --> 01:11:37.958
Option two, we let her die.

01:11:39.879 --> 01:11:42.747
<i>Repeat,
the order is to exit.</i>

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:44.251
Now!

01:11:45.593 --> 01:11:46.629
Let's go get her.

01:11:48.262 --> 01:11:49.503
<i>Let's go get her.</i>

01:11:49.597 --> 01:11:51.054
Son of a bitch.

01:11:54.977 --> 01:11:56.388
Do not fuck me.

01:11:57.230 --> 01:11:58.230
Let's go.

01:11:58.314 --> 01:11:59.874
Mother, Child-One.
Make it dark in here.

01:12:01.692 --> 01:12:02.692
Fine.

01:12:46.737 --> 01:12:48.069
Go.

01:12:58.541 --> 01:12:59.577
<i>Stay here.</i>

01:13:06.507 --> 01:13:08.169
Silva, do you copy?

01:13:08.801 --> 01:13:11.293
Silva, do you copy?
Silva, do you copy?

01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:10.128
Hey, Jimmy, all you had to do
was hand him over.

01:15:11.132 --> 01:15:13.044
<i>Who?
You mean the low-level cop?</i>

01:15:30.818 --> 01:15:32.671
What's the rush, Jimmy?
You got somewhere to be?

01:15:32.695 --> 01:15:33.714
- Fuck you.
- I could do this

01:15:33.738 --> 01:15:34.738
all day, baby.

01:15:46.834 --> 01:15:48.541
Please. I'm a...

01:15:55.801 --> 01:15:57.281
Please, I'm a mother. Please.

01:15:58.929 --> 01:15:59.929
I have a...

01:16:00.431 --> 01:16:01.763
I have a daughter.

01:16:18.699 --> 01:16:21.066
Hey, Jimmy, you and I, we
could have made a great team.

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:23.402
You happen to have any more
.45 caliber ammo back there?

01:16:23.496 --> 01:16:24.577
Here it is!

01:17:39.405 --> 01:17:40.862
Let's go. Now. Move.

01:17:40.948 --> 01:17:43.315
Fucking wasted 10 minutes
coming back for you.

01:17:57.464 --> 01:17:58.464
Child-One,

01:17:58.549 --> 01:18:01.542
<i>Nissan pickup,
back parking lot.</i>

01:18:01.635 --> 01:18:04.218
<i>Repeat. It's at the back
of the building.</i>

01:18:07.892 --> 01:18:09.494
Come on, come on.

01:18:09.518 --> 01:18:10.518
Let's go.

01:18:24.408 --> 01:18:26.525
Mother, Child-One.
What's our route?

01:18:27.578 --> 01:18:28.680
<i>Child-One,
stand by for new route.</i>

01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:33.039
We have their location.
Let's go.

01:18:33.125 --> 01:18:34.125
<i>Child-One...</i>

01:18:34.210 --> 01:18:37.374
Child-One, the route
is directly behind you.

01:18:37.463 --> 01:18:38.463
<i>Take it.</i>

01:18:44.595 --> 01:18:46.031
<i>- Engines turning.
- Copy that. Roger.</i>

01:18:46.055 --> 01:18:47.671
<i>We're buttoned up.
Oscar Mike.</i>

01:18:47.765 --> 01:18:49.285
<i>- We are set.
- Let's go.</i>

01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:51.512
The end of an operation
is euphoric.

01:18:56.315 --> 01:18:58.602
It's placing that last piece
in the puzzle.

01:19:00.736 --> 01:19:02.648
You know
the euphoria cannot last.

01:19:02.738 --> 01:19:04.195
<i>Ten minutes
to Bingo Fuel.</i>

01:19:04.281 --> 01:19:05.522
<i>Where is your package?</i>

01:19:05.616 --> 01:19:07.456
<i>Window is closing.
We need to be wheels-up now!</i>

01:19:07.534 --> 01:19:09.275
Get your ass
to the airstrip now.

01:19:09.370 --> 01:19:10.650
<i>Yeah,
I'm working on that.</i>

01:19:11.205 --> 01:19:12.662
You tell yourself,
"This one time..."

01:19:12.748 --> 01:19:14.851
<i>If I wait, we're all
gonna die. Hurry the fuck up!</i>

01:19:14.875 --> 01:19:16.035
"...just might be different."

01:19:19.588 --> 01:19:20.628
"Just might be different."

01:19:21.882 --> 01:19:23.965
Have you confirmed
with the ground team?

01:19:24.051 --> 01:19:25.508
Yes, they're ready.

01:19:25.594 --> 01:19:26.675
Good.

01:19:27.972 --> 01:19:30.885
"Today I just might be able
to just hold it, catch it

01:19:33.519 --> 01:19:35.260
"in my hands
and look at it."

01:19:38.482 --> 01:19:40.042
<i>Tell them to stop the plane.
We're here.</i>

01:19:49.285 --> 01:19:51.948
Mother, we don't have time
for this.

01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:54.116
- King.
- Yup.

01:19:56.125 --> 01:19:58.663
Child-One, Mother.
My pleasure.

01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:02.880
Target acquired.

01:20:03.507 --> 01:20:04.507
Take it.

01:20:11.932 --> 01:20:12.932
Let's go.

01:20:18.188 --> 01:20:19.679
What's the status
of the plane?

01:20:19.773 --> 01:20:21.213
<i>The LZ's hot.
We're rolling.</i>

01:20:21.984 --> 01:20:23.020
Child-One...

01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:24.590
You tell those fuckers
to wait.

01:20:26.697 --> 01:20:29.064
They're gonna stay put
no matter what.

01:20:29.158 --> 01:20:30.302
<i>Overwatch is requesting...</i>

01:20:30.326 --> 01:20:31.926
<i>Negative.
The window is closing.</i>

01:20:31.952 --> 01:20:34.569
Tell those pilots
I don't give a fuck!

01:20:35.914 --> 01:20:37.954
<i>Tell 'em we're here.
We're on the runway now.</i>

01:20:40.169 --> 01:20:42.035
<i>Holy shit! Abort!
Abort! Abort!</i>

01:20:42.129 --> 01:20:43.415
<i>Abort! Abort! Abort!</i>

01:20:44.089 --> 01:20:45.751
<i>Abort! Copy that.
We're aborting!</i>

01:20:45.841 --> 01:20:47.110
<i>Okay. Tell me
when the package is there.</i>

01:20:47.134 --> 01:20:48.134
<i>Copy.</i>

01:20:49.345 --> 01:20:50.677
Let's go. Move.

01:20:50.763 --> 01:20:52.629
Code. Now.

01:20:52.723 --> 01:20:53.723
Hey.

01:20:54.767 --> 01:20:56.053
You got something for me now?

01:20:57.144 --> 01:21:02.560
R-O-Z-H-D-E-S-T-V-O...

01:21:02.649 --> 01:21:03.685
<i>1-1-1.</i>

01:21:04.693 --> 01:21:06.400
Mother, Child-One,
Rebel, Oz...

01:21:06.487 --> 01:21:08.353
<i>R-O-Z-H-D-</i>

01:21:08.447 --> 01:21:09.813
E-S-T...
<i>- Trust, Virgin,</i>

01:21:09.907 --> 01:21:12.615
<i>- Oyster, triple-one.</i>
- V-O-1-1-1.

01:21:13.869 --> 01:21:15.076
This is a hard line of work.

01:21:15.162 --> 01:21:16.362
What line is that? Witchcraft?

01:21:17.122 --> 01:21:18.122
Our line.

01:21:18.207 --> 01:21:20.449
We are not in the same line.
Respectfully.

01:21:20.542 --> 01:21:22.283
Respectfully, we are.

01:21:26.215 --> 01:21:27.956
It stopped. The clock stopped.

01:21:28.926 --> 01:21:30.417
We have five locations
of the caesium.

01:21:30.511 --> 01:21:32.343
Five locations
have been confirmed.

01:21:32.429 --> 01:21:33.629
They're being sent to Langley.

01:21:34.515 --> 01:21:36.177
<i>He's clear.
Put him on the plane.</i>

01:21:37.351 --> 01:21:38.351
Go.

01:21:39.728 --> 01:21:40.935
Hands up.

01:21:41.355 --> 01:21:42.355
Embark.

01:21:44.191 --> 01:21:45.191
<i>He's clear.</i>

01:21:45.275 --> 01:21:46.686
This might actually work.

01:21:46.777 --> 01:21:48.171
- Okay, we're rolling.
- Let's move.

01:21:48.195 --> 01:21:49.381
<i>Let's get this package
out of here.</i>

01:21:49.405 --> 01:21:50.405
<i>Clear.</i>

01:21:52.324 --> 01:21:53.565
You got six days. Go.

01:21:54.159 --> 01:21:55.159
Go be a mother.

01:21:55.702 --> 01:21:56.702
Go.

01:21:59.957 --> 01:22:00.957
I'll be back in five.

01:22:04.878 --> 01:22:05.878
Oh, hey.

01:22:07.881 --> 01:22:09.121
Say hello to your Mother
for me.

01:22:14.847 --> 01:22:15.847
My what?

01:22:16.849 --> 01:22:17.930
Say hello to who?

01:22:18.016 --> 01:22:19.427
What the fuck did you say?

01:22:31.905 --> 01:22:32.986
What are you doing?

01:22:41.081 --> 01:22:42.361
It's odd.
They're spiking.

01:22:43.459 --> 01:22:45.576
Maybe he doesn't like planes.

01:22:58.265 --> 01:22:59.426
Madam General.

01:23:00.267 --> 01:23:02.259
It's almost time,
would you like to watch?

01:23:02.352 --> 01:23:03.433
Yes.

01:23:04.354 --> 01:23:06.687
Bishop, look.

01:23:07.316 --> 01:23:08.516
It's taking over our computer.

01:23:11.195 --> 01:23:12.436
It's not done encoding.

01:23:19.661 --> 01:23:20.661
Who's that?

01:23:21.121 --> 01:23:22.121
Who is that?

01:23:29.463 --> 01:23:30.463
What is this?

01:23:33.675 --> 01:23:34.916
Meditation, Alice.

01:23:37.429 --> 01:23:38.549
Keeps me focused on the job.

01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:41.256
The code is Russian.

01:23:42.434 --> 01:23:43.720
Jesus. All things Russian.

01:23:44.478 --> 01:23:47.437
The code word is Russian
for Christmas.

01:23:47.523 --> 01:23:49.355
It says 111 Christmas...

01:23:50.192 --> 01:23:51.192
Christmas Street?

01:23:54.571 --> 01:23:56.312
It's a Trojan horse op.

01:24:01.620 --> 01:24:03.452
<i>Take off, wheels up.</i>

01:24:03.539 --> 01:24:04.905
He's not a double agent.

01:24:08.085 --> 01:24:09.826
He's a triple agent.

01:24:25.811 --> 01:24:26.811
Oh, my God.

01:24:27.229 --> 01:24:28.265
He's a Russian.

01:24:28.355 --> 01:24:30.813
Child-One, Mother.
Keep them on the ground.

01:24:30.899 --> 01:24:32.435
<i>I repeat. Keep them on the...</i>

01:24:36.154 --> 01:24:37.154
Gotcha.

01:24:37.864 --> 01:24:38.864
No!

01:24:54.715 --> 01:24:56.075
<i>This is
a very simple story.</i>

01:24:59.303 --> 01:25:00.464
Killed the wrong kid.

01:25:02.931 --> 01:25:04.371
<i>Eighteen years of age...</i>

01:25:08.061 --> 01:25:09.268
<i>A mother lost her son,</i>

01:25:09.354 --> 01:25:11.767
<i>and it turns out
she was a very powerful lady.</i>

01:25:18.822 --> 01:25:20.404
Failure of imagination.

01:25:20.490 --> 01:25:22.130
<i>You mean
the death of Overwatch.</i>

01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:24.241
Death of what?

01:25:24.328 --> 01:25:25.444
Overwatch.

01:25:25.537 --> 01:25:26.869
You were the target.

01:25:28.915 --> 01:25:30.201
<i>Mayday!
Package is armed</i>

01:25:30.292 --> 01:25:31.373
<i>and attempting hostile...</i>

01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:32.792
He did everything right.

01:25:32.878 --> 01:25:34.710
He was unpredictable.
Highly trained.

01:25:36.590 --> 01:25:37.950
<i>Recruited
when he was young.</i>

01:25:38.091 --> 01:25:39.753
He convinced us
he did not trust us,

01:25:39.843 --> 01:25:41.300
and then convinced us
to trust him.

01:25:45.766 --> 01:25:47.326
Do you wanna
talk about Alice?

01:25:48.769 --> 01:25:51.182
Do you wanna talk about what
happened on that airplane?

01:25:51.271 --> 01:25:52.332
<i>Mayday!
Mayday! Mayday!</i>

01:25:52.356 --> 01:25:53.437
<i>Cockpit has been breached!</i>

01:25:53.523 --> 01:25:55.560
<i>Package is armed.
Direct to immediate LZ.</i>

01:25:55.651 --> 01:25:56.732
No.

01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:02.990
<i>You already know this.</i>

01:26:03.075 --> 01:26:04.075
Tell me again.

01:26:04.117 --> 01:26:05.557
I've already gone over this
with you.

01:26:07.454 --> 01:26:10.947
They activated him
to make us activate Overwatch.

01:26:14.711 --> 01:26:15.952
Say hello to your Mother
for me.

01:26:16.046 --> 01:26:17.878
<i>Bishop, come in.
Can you hear me?</i>

01:26:17.964 --> 01:26:19.804
<i>Bishop, can you
hear me? Bishop? Over.</i>

01:26:19.841 --> 01:26:21.127
I think there is no defense

01:26:21.218 --> 01:26:22.403
against someone
willing to die.

01:26:22.427 --> 01:26:24.419
Someone capable
of cultivating our trust

01:26:24.513 --> 01:26:26.721
by offering us
the one thing that we want,

01:26:26.807 --> 01:26:28.093
and the one thing
that we need,

01:26:28.183 --> 01:26:29.863
that's the real weapon
of mass destruction.

01:26:32.187 --> 01:26:33.678
A killer
who looks like a hero.

01:26:39.695 --> 01:26:41.027
<i>The great game continues.</i>

01:26:46.618 --> 01:26:47.618
<i>Today was yours.</i>

01:26:59.464 --> 01:27:00.796
I'll see you tomorrow.
