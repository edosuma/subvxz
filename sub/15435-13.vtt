WEBVTT

00:00.310 --> 00:01.870
Previously on "brothers & sisters"...

00:01.880 --> 00:04.700
- we took michigan!
- Yes!

00:05.240 --> 00:06.860
How soon can you be packed?

00:06.870 --> 00:11.120
We just got ourselves a meeting with the chairman
of golden plum imports this evening in san francisco.

00:11.130 --> 00:11.920
Thank you very much.

00:11.930 --> 00:16.160
The only thing I want to do right
now is to see you. I miss you.

00:16.170 --> 00:19.980
You're gonna have to leave now, or
I'm pretty sure I'm gonna kiss you.

00:20.360 --> 00:23.490
Mom, there's no way that...
I mean, he couldn'T...

00:23.500 --> 00:28.660
oh, god, no. William
walker was your father.

00:28.670 --> 00:31.730
Not even gonna say good-bye,
are you? Was I that bad?

00:31.740 --> 00:34.360
No, you were far from bad.

00:34.370 --> 00:39.390
We will not stop until
we get to the white house!

00:39.900 --> 00:41.080
what took you so long?

00:41.090 --> 00:42.450
the 405 was jammed.

00:42.460 --> 00:43.330
How much time do we have?

00:43.350 --> 00:46.970
Uh, I gotta pick up the
kids in 1 hour, 47 minutes.

00:46.980 --> 00:48.550
- and mccallister's ahead in massachusetts.
- I know.

00:48.560 --> 00:50.440
I heard it in the car.

00:50.450 --> 00:52.300
- man, you look amazing.
- Oh, thank you.

00:52.310 --> 00:56.470
I can't believe how much bras
have improved while I was married.

00:56.480 --> 00:57.730
I can't miss his speech.

00:57.740 --> 01:00.390
Oh, it'll be a while.

01:00.890 --> 01:02.210
Are these important?

01:02.220 --> 01:04.410
- Depends.
- On what?

01:04.420 --> 01:07.860
On if the profits from our china
deal going up is arousing to you.

01:07.870 --> 01:09.530
Apparently, it is to you.

01:11.120 --> 01:13.710
Why do republicans have so
many winner-take-all primaries?

01:13.720 --> 01:15.010
Because they hate weakness.

01:15.020 --> 01:17.650
Even if you come a close second,
you have to be culled from the herd.

01:17.660 --> 01:20.910
It's so darwinian for people
who don't believe in evolution.

01:20.920 --> 01:22.030
Yeah, at least we're decisive.

01:22.040 --> 01:25.710
You guys are so sensitive, you split your
delegates so nobody gets their feelings hurt.

01:25.720 --> 01:27.520
Oh, no. They just called
illinois for taylor.

01:27.530 --> 01:28.520
How many delegates is that?

01:28.530 --> 01:31.030
Uh, 57. That's not good.

01:32.780 --> 01:34.210
hey, sweetie.

01:34.220 --> 01:35.810
- Yeah, I know, we just saw.
- Hi, scotty.

01:35.820 --> 01:37.630
I have no idea. It is
so freakin' complicated.

01:37.640 --> 01:39.240
Look, mccallister took connecticut!

01:39.250 --> 01:40.150
- Yes!
- Yes!

01:40.160 --> 01:44.210
Uh, yeah, I know. We just saw,
okay? I gotta go. Love you, bye.

01:44.220 --> 01:45.480
What's going on in new york?

01:45.490 --> 01:46.600
It's still too close to call.

01:46.610 --> 01:48.920
God, this is no way to run a country.

01:48.930 --> 01:52.400
David, they didn't have mint chocolate,
so I got cherry chunk instead.

01:52.410 --> 01:54.940
Um, cherry chunk's fine.

01:55.710 --> 01:57.160
- Mom?
- You're back.

01:57.170 --> 01:59.660
Yeah, we should probably
eat this before it melts.

01:59.670 --> 02:01.060
It's kind of warm in here.

02:01.070 --> 02:03.200
uh, here, let me help you.

02:03.760 --> 02:06.940
N.B.S.Is calling new york for taylor.

02:06.950 --> 02:10.100
Oh, no. Mccallister lost new york?

02:10.110 --> 02:12.090
Have they called missouri yet?

02:12.100 --> 02:13.780
You know, I'm not sure.

02:13.790 --> 02:16.200
I can't believe you guys were
totally making out like teenagers.

02:16.220 --> 02:20.890
We were not. We--we kissed one or
two times. Don't make so much of it.

02:20.900 --> 02:22.660
Mccallister won california!

02:22.670 --> 02:25.060
Okay! Okay!

02:26.780 --> 02:31.000
taylor's waiting for you to give
your speech. You're good to go.

02:33.690 --> 02:34.950
you ready?

02:34.960 --> 02:39.010
Yeah. Yeah, I'm--I'm--
I'm ready if you are.

02:39.020 --> 02:40.680
Okay.

02:43.670 --> 02:45.820
I'm proud of you.

02:47.080 --> 02:48.550
Thank you.

03:00.120 --> 03:01.870
Thank you, california!

03:01.880 --> 03:05.100
It is great to be back home!

03:07.490 --> 03:10.060
I have so many people that
I want to thank, but first,

03:10.070 --> 03:13.910
I want to acknowledge the heart
and the soul of this campaign--

03:13.920 --> 03:16.700
my wife kitty mccallister.

03:20.860 --> 03:23.890
- you're still up?
- Yeah.

03:25.020 --> 03:27.710
They keep replaying it over and over.

03:27.720 --> 03:30.020
I keep hoping it'll
turn out differently.

03:30.030 --> 03:33.070
I just got off the phone
with congressman taylor.

03:33.080 --> 03:35.960
I congratulated him on
all of his victories.

03:35.980 --> 03:40.480
no, no. He ran a great campaign,
and he deserves our respect.

03:40.880 --> 03:43.180
Tonight he crossed the threshold.

03:43.190 --> 03:47.220
He has the delegates to
be our party's nominee.

03:47.750 --> 03:53.120
And so, tonight I am suspending my campaign
for the republican nomination for president.

03:53.130 --> 03:54.640
How are they?

03:54.650 --> 03:55.710
- Robert and kitty?
- Yeah.

03:55.720 --> 03:59.030
- I still have the honor of being your senator.
- They're strong.

04:00.520 --> 04:01.840
isaac?

04:01.850 --> 04:04.560
- I'm just resting my eyes.
- Yeah.

04:05.450 --> 04:08.530
You don't have to get right
back to washington, do you?

04:08.540 --> 04:10.490
Mm, no.

04:10.970 --> 04:15.370
Good, because I thought maybe you
could stick around here for a while...

04:16.750 --> 04:18.860
If you want to.

04:19.490 --> 04:22.390
- And I promise to bring all of the passion...
- isaac?

04:22.400 --> 04:27.120
From this campaign to the service
of the great people of california!

04:27.570 --> 04:30.710
good night, and god bless america!

04:31.770 --> 04:33.790
Three months later

04:42.530 --> 04:45.300
They need new magazines.

04:47.890 --> 04:49.780
okay.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.460
- Everything you need is in here.
- Okay.

04:53.200 --> 04:54.690
- she hates needles.
- Oh, I don't hate them.

04:54.700 --> 04:57.300
- You hate needles.
- All right, fine, I hate them.

04:57.310 --> 05:00.470
You've got 12 doses
here, one for every day,

05:00.480 --> 05:03.500
and then you'll come back,
and we'll harvest your eggs.

05:03.510 --> 05:05.200
h-harvest.

05:05.210 --> 05:08.080
Uh, can we just, um, go
over the side effects again?

05:08.090 --> 05:13.010
Uh, yeah. It's a hormone, so the
usual-- mood swings, irritability.

05:13.020 --> 05:13.750
Mm, great.

05:13.760 --> 05:17.050
So just like I showed
you. Quick jab to the hip.

05:17.060 --> 05:18.590
Okay.

05:19.600 --> 05:21.070
And your job is to relax.

05:21.080 --> 05:24.030
Okay, just--just make sure that
you do exactly what she says. Okay?

05:24.040 --> 05:26.530
Is this you relaxing?

05:26.870 --> 05:29.300
By the way, I voted for you.

05:29.310 --> 05:31.220
Thank you.

05:33.080 --> 05:34.280
Okay.

05:35.800 --> 05:37.550
- What?
- Well, I wasn't ready.

05:37.560 --> 05:40.020
- You said okay.
- "Okay" means okay.

05:40.030 --> 05:42.990
"go" means go, robert.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.350
Okay, this is so hard.

05:44.360 --> 05:46.810
You'll get the hang of it,
and I'll see you in a week.

05:46.820 --> 05:48.490
Thank you.

05:50.760 --> 05:52.300
are you all right?

05:52.310 --> 05:55.330
yeah. You know what? I'm sorry.
I'm just-- I'm just way too tense.

05:55.340 --> 05:59.040
I just wish that there was a way that we could
do this without getting our hopes up again.

06:00.370 --> 06:04.000
What do you say you and i go out
to dinner tonight to vincenti?

06:04.720 --> 06:06.510
Yes. Yeah.

06:06.520 --> 06:10.100
Why--why don't we invite isaac
and mom? She loves that place.

06:10.110 --> 06:12.180
No, I-I think she has
a previous engagement.

06:12.190 --> 06:15.030
Isaac said something
about a special dinner.

06:15.040 --> 06:18.060
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:18.430 --> 06:21.570
- How special?
- I don't know.

06:21.580 --> 06:24.460
Oh, you know there's a special
dinner, but you don't know why?

06:24.470 --> 06:25.780
Okay, he swore me to secrecy.

06:25.790 --> 06:27.210
Oh, really? Well, you're
gonna tell me, robert,

06:27.220 --> 06:29.510
or I am going to inject you with
so many hormones that you will,

06:29.520 --> 06:32.140
in fact, grow boobs and sing soprano.

06:32.150 --> 06:36.010
- Look at these side effects comin' on so fast. 
- No, no, no, you--

06:39.270 --> 06:40.700
Hey, sweetheart.

06:40.710 --> 06:43.880
I got some appointments downtown,
but I'll be back in plenty of time.

06:43.890 --> 06:45.270
Hey, what are you doing?

06:45.280 --> 06:46.920
Cleaning out the junk drawer.

06:46.930 --> 06:48.090
That's quite a project.

06:48.100 --> 06:49.480
I save too much stuff.

06:49.490 --> 06:53.000
Um, your briefcase is
there, right by my laptop.

06:53.990 --> 06:55.940
Uh, is something wrong? We're
still on for dinner, right?

06:55.950 --> 06:58.470
I don't know. Are we?

06:58.480 --> 07:02.340
God, why do I have so many rubber bands?

07:02.350 --> 07:06.790
Kitty thought it would be good for me if I started
reading some of the republican blogs you like so much.

07:06.800 --> 07:10.000
It's a good picture of
you, don't you think?

07:11.690 --> 07:13.060
I was going to tell you.

07:13.070 --> 07:15.440
When? When you move back to D.C.?

07:15.450 --> 07:19.200
Look, you have every right, isaac,
to take a professorship if you want--

07:19.210 --> 07:20.430
adjunct. Just twice a week.

07:20.440 --> 07:24.180
I just think it would have been nice
had you told me before I read it online.

07:24.200 --> 07:27.450
I'm sorry, but I've been
here almost three months,

07:27.460 --> 07:30.190
and I keep making excuse
after excuse not to go home.

07:30.200 --> 07:33.490
Well, then go! Go. PleasE.

07:33.500 --> 07:37.370
I'm cleaning out everything
today--rubber bands, you.

07:37.380 --> 07:41.560
I'll be like a B.B.In an empty box,
rolling around this giant old house, but go.

07:41.570 --> 07:44.640
- Nora, I want you to come with me.
- What?

07:44.650 --> 07:46.500
I know we haven't known
each other that long, but--

07:46.510 --> 07:49.540
you want me to move to D.C.With you?

07:49.550 --> 07:50.720
I do.

07:50.730 --> 07:53.720
That's why I was gonna make
dinner for you tonight--

07:53.730 --> 07:56.270
so I could ask you.

07:58.850 --> 07:59.950
I don't know what to say.

07:59.960 --> 08:01.550
"Yes" is what I was hoping for.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.490
Brothers & Sisters 
Season02 Episode13

08:10.870 --> 08:14.400
Mom move to washington?
that'll never happen.

08:14.410 --> 08:17.170
Oh, well, we never thought that she'd
get busted for smoking pot, either.

08:17.180 --> 08:19.710
There is no way that she's
gonna leave paige and coop,

08:19.720 --> 08:21.620
much less what you've
got going on in the oven.

08:21.630 --> 08:23.630
I hope something's going on in the oven.

08:23.640 --> 08:25.410
Oh, come on, kitty. It will happen.

08:25.420 --> 08:28.940
You already sound hormonal-- all this
worrying about mom, who isn't moving--

08:28.950 --> 08:31.750
you're right. I'm just
being overly anxious.

08:31.760 --> 08:33.480
Uh, saul's here. I gotta go.

08:33.490 --> 08:35.159
Oh, you know what? You
better not say anything.

08:35.169 --> 08:38.289
Of course I won'T. Bye.

08:38.299 --> 08:41.049
Isaac's asking mom to move
to washington with him.

08:41.059 --> 08:42.990
Well, obviously, he doesn't
know anything about your mother.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.910
Listen, have you seen graham's proposal?

08:44.920 --> 08:47.880
The profit margin is through
the roof.If he wants us to--

08:47.890 --> 08:50.680
what makes you so sure mom
wouldn't move to washington?

08:50.690 --> 08:52.940
- And you're not listening to a thing I'm saying.
- Sorry.

08:52.950 --> 08:55.240
Are you gonna be at your mother's
tonight? Whose birthday is it, anyway?

08:55.250 --> 08:56.460
The new
one--rebecca.

08:56.470 --> 08:58.200
Ok. We'll talk then.

08:58.210 --> 09:01.350
Uh, who would have the parties
if mom moved to washington?

09:01.360 --> 09:04.030
She's not going to washington.

09:05.420 --> 09:06.250
She wouldn'T.

09:06.260 --> 09:09.320
- And have holly sign these, too.
- yeah.

09:09.330 --> 09:11.430
- Hello?
- Want to hear something outlandish?

09:11.440 --> 09:13.700
- Ooh, I love outlandish.
- What?

09:13.710 --> 09:16.540
isaac wants mom to move
to washington with him.

09:16.550 --> 09:18.000
He's asking her tonight.

09:18.010 --> 09:19.080
What is he, crazy?

09:19.090 --> 09:20.150
- Hi, tommy.
- Hey.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.880
You don't think mom wod really
leave paige and coop, do you?

09:22.890 --> 09:24.580
Hello, what about elizabeth?

09:24.590 --> 09:25.950
Oh, get a grip. She'd never leave me.

09:25.960 --> 09:28.740
Someone should call justin and see if he
knows anything. I mean, he lives there.

09:28.750 --> 09:29.960
Yeah, it's ringing. She's not moving.

09:29.970 --> 09:32.570
She doesn't have any winter clothes.

09:32.580 --> 09:36.250
Hey, justin, have you heard about this
whole isaac-asking-mom- to-move-to-D.C.Thing?

09:36.260 --> 09:37.100
No way.

09:37.120 --> 09:38.520
Yeah, justin hasn't heard a thing.

09:38.550 --> 09:40.080
Wow, I hope she lets him down easy.

09:40.090 --> 09:41.290
This is never gonna happen.

09:41.300 --> 09:44.030
I don't know. Have you seen
how happy she looks with him?

09:44.040 --> 09:46.640
Sarah, ts is mom we're talking
about. She'd never leave that house.

09:46.650 --> 09:47.550
Come on, it's impossible.

09:47.560 --> 09:49.220
All right, that's insane. I
gotta go. I'm on the other line.

09:49.230 --> 09:51.750
- All right, bye.
- bye!

09:52.830 --> 09:55.360
She invited my mom over to
bake. Can't you stop this?

09:55.370 --> 09:58.440
No. I mean, look, you cannot get
between nora and a birthday party.

09:58.450 --> 10:00.650
- So that's it?
- Yep. Welcome to being a walker.

10:00.660 --> 10:02.460
All right, see you later.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.830
all right, that's it.
You guys have to come.

10:06.580 --> 10:09.180
Do you really think that's appropriate?

10:09.190 --> 10:12.550
Appropriate? It's my birthday,
and he's a family friend.

10:12.560 --> 10:13.570
I-I know,
but--

10:13.580 --> 10:15.950
why wouldn't it be appropriate?

10:16.240 --> 10:22.130
Fine. We'll introduce david
to the walkers. It'll be fun.

10:24.810 --> 10:26.650
I'm sorry i spoiled your surprise.

10:26.660 --> 10:29.450
It didn't occur to you I might ask?

10:29.770 --> 10:31.620
Oh, I don't know. I...

10:31.630 --> 10:33.630
I thought maybe we would
travel back and forth.

10:33.640 --> 10:38.190
Hey, nora, I've lived out
of a suitcase for 30 years,

10:38.200 --> 10:42.230
and I want to settle down,
and I want you there with me.

10:43.340 --> 10:45.750
mom? Mom?

10:45.760 --> 10:46.770
In here.

10:46.780 --> 10:50.890
Why it so dark in... here?

10:50.900 --> 10:53.360
Oh, uh, sorry.

10:53.370 --> 10:55.220
is there something you need?

10:55.230 --> 10:58.080
Uh, me? No.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.360
Then why are you here?

11:02.660 --> 11:04.070
because...

11:04.080 --> 11:07.160
me and justin and kevin are
going to play golf tomorrow,

11:07.170 --> 11:10.720
and I wanted to know if isaac wanted
to join us, make it a foursome.

11:10.730 --> 11:12.030
That sounds great.

11:12.040 --> 11:15.350
Good. Great.

11:16.650 --> 11:21.960
Okay, well, I'm gonna go
make a-a sandwich before I go.

11:21.970 --> 11:23.500
So where were we?

11:23.510 --> 11:26.470
Oh, I brought some pictures
of my place in georgetown.

11:26.480 --> 11:28.410
oh, isaac.

11:28.420 --> 11:31.820
You really don't need
to sell me. Although...

11:31.830 --> 11:34.400
And I want to show you "mary."

11:34.410 --> 11:36.040
Who's mary?

11:36.050 --> 11:38.170
My sailboaT.

11:38.180 --> 11:40.660
Hello, "mary."

11:43.680 --> 11:44.480
Oh, tommy!

11:44.490 --> 11:46.060
- What are you doing here?
- What? Quiet!

11:46.070 --> 11:47.750
It's going down, okay?

11:47.770 --> 11:51.760
Isaac'in there. He's making the whole
sales pitch-- candlelight, the whole thing.

11:51.770 --> 11:52.940
Has mom said no yet?

11:52.950 --> 11:54.450
I don't know, but she
looks kind of pissed.

11:54.460 --> 11:57.080
That's good. That
means they're fighting.

11:57.530 --> 11:59.120
who's that?

12:00.520 --> 12:02.000
- It's kevin!
- What?

12:02.010 --> 12:04.910
- What's he doing here?
- No reason.

12:05.640 --> 12:08.430
Whose, uh, gorgeous townhouse is this?

12:08.440 --> 12:09.840
I mean, is that an original fireplace?

12:09.850 --> 12:11.680
I had it restored a feyears ago.

12:11.690 --> 12:13.690
This--this
is your house?

12:13.700 --> 12:16.060
And this is his sailboat, too.

12:17.890 --> 12:19.250
Tommy, what are you doing?

12:19.260 --> 12:20.120
Tommy's here?

12:20.130 --> 12:23.380
- uh, sarah knocked a pot off the stove.
- oh, what?

12:23.390 --> 12:25.150
Sarah's in there, too?

12:25.160 --> 12:27.410
hi, mom!

12:29.850 --> 12:32.880
- Kikitt
- hello!

12:34.130 --> 12:36.500
what is going on?

12:36.510 --> 12:41.060
Sorry, I--oh!
Isaac, hi.

12:42.350 --> 12:45.420
What is this, just some
sort of colossal coincidence

12:45.430 --> 12:48.120
that you're all here
interrupting my romantic dinner?

12:48.130 --> 12:49.720
- No, sorry- -
that's not true.

12:49.730 --> 12:52.750
I came to tell isaac
about golf. Kev, right?

12:52.760 --> 12:54.370
What golf?

12:54.380 --> 12:55.480
Kev,
the g--

12:55.490 --> 12:57.480
oh, too bad justin isn't here.

12:57.490 --> 13:00.440
Then I could tell everyone at once.

13:05.180 --> 13:06.070
What are you doing here?

13:06.080 --> 13:07.750
Uh, I live here, pant-load.

13:07.760 --> 13:09.350
Y-y--all
right. Okay.

13:09.360 --> 13:13.690
S-since you all seem to be
here for no discernible reason,

13:13.710 --> 13:16.160
I might as well tell you
all what I have to say.

13:16.170 --> 13:20.530
Um, isaac has asked me to
move to wasngton with him.

13:20.540 --> 13:22.790
- Really? -
Wow, that's--

13:22.800 --> 13:27.460
Obviously, that kind of change
in my life would be unsettling.

13:27.470 --> 13:28.770
- Yeah.
- sorry, man.

13:28.780 --> 13:31.070
- the grandchildren, they'd be devastated.
- sorry, bro.

13:31.080 --> 13:35.380
Which is exactly why I
think I should say yes.

13:37.300 --> 13:39.210
Yes?

13:39.880 --> 13:43.000
- Yes?
- Yes.

13:43.800 --> 13:45.180
- What?
- Yes.

13:45.190 --> 13:45.800
Yes?

13:45.810 --> 13:47.800
- no, no.
- Yes.

13:50.700 --> 13:53.750
hey, looks like a beautiful course.

13:53.760 --> 13:55.420
Appreciate the invitE.

13:55.450 --> 13:56.670
It's our pleasure.

13:56.680 --> 14:00.140
Yeah, we figure we better, uh, get to know
the guy who's shacking up with our mom, right?

14:00.150 --> 14:03.090
that's right, just ask
him a few questions.

14:03.480 --> 14:05.380
I got one.

14:05.390 --> 14:06.690
- Who's going first?
- You are.

14:06.700 --> 14:08.300
- It's all you.
- Yeah, take your time.

14:08.310 --> 14:11.300
Hopefully, I can pull a
muscle before it's my turn.

14:13.240 --> 14:15.810
so, uh, so how--how big
is your house, isaac?

14:15.820 --> 14:19.450
'Cause mom, you know, she comes with
a lot of knickknacks and... pillows.

14:19.460 --> 14:22.110
Oh, I think I can make room.

14:22.590 --> 14:26.680
You got a backyard, right? 'Cause,
uh, mom loves her gardening.

14:26.690 --> 14:28.110
it's more like a courtyard.

14:28.120 --> 14:29.260
- Courtyard.
- Courtyard, yeah.

14:29.270 --> 14:31.960
Well, you do have a pool, right? 'Cause
mom, you know, she swims every day.

14:31.970 --> 14:36.000
Oh, kind of... a little birdbath.

14:36.550 --> 14:37.900
No pool.

14:37.910 --> 14:40.170
can't afford a pool, huh?

14:42.580 --> 14:45.420
How much do you owe on the townhouse?

14:46.130 --> 14:48.930
I'm sorry. I-I manage
mom's financial affairs.

14:48.940 --> 14:53.350
I just don't want her taking on any
more liabilities than she already has.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.570
It's paid off.

14:55.580 --> 14:58.450
- Paid off.
- it's paid off.

14:59.780 --> 15:03.600
so has mom said anything to
you about selling her house?

15:06.670 --> 15:09.410
How many ounces are in 2 cups?

15:09.420 --> 15:13.350
Uh, 16. 2 cups in a pint.

15:13.710 --> 15:18.290
Oh, when I think of all the birthday
cakes I've baked in my lifetime.

15:18.300 --> 15:21.660
I always go store-bought--
a good store, but still...

15:21.670 --> 15:24.760
ooh, that sounds liberatinG.

15:24.770 --> 15:27.030
I still have to make the lasagna.

15:27.040 --> 15:31.190
Why is it everyone's favorite
dish is homemade pasta?

15:31.200 --> 15:34.600
- well, I've got plenty of numbers.
- Really?

15:35.010 --> 15:37.280
Very tempting.

15:37.290 --> 15:41.200
I remember the last time
we were around a cake.

15:41.210 --> 15:42.820
All right, I threw it in your face.

15:42.830 --> 15:47.060
- Bui recall a bowl of peas headed in my direction.
- True.

15:47.570 --> 15:49.490
We've come a long way.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.570
Well, we both have men in our lives now.

15:51.580 --> 15:53.970
Luckily, not the same one.

15:55.410 --> 15:59.140
are you really moving to D.C.?

15:59.150 --> 16:03.270
I guess so. I even called a
real estate person this morning.

16:03.540 --> 16:04.470
That's serious.

16:04.480 --> 16:07.500
I didn't know I was gonna say yes.

16:07.510 --> 16:11.130
Really, just there was this
wonderful man offering me A...

16:11.140 --> 16:15.720
a new chapter at my age, a-a whole
new life, all I had to do was say yes.

16:15.740 --> 16:18.500
It just seemed to fly out of
my mouth. W-what about you?

16:18.510 --> 16:21.600
- You're-- you're dating
a director? - David.

16:21.610 --> 16:24.050
I hope you don't mind
that we're bringing him.

16:24.060 --> 16:26.970
No, no, no. Rebecca likes him, right?

16:26.980 --> 16:30.150
Mm, yeah. They're fast friends.

16:30.160 --> 16:31.910
- You don't sound happy.
- No, no.

16:31.920 --> 16:37.630
It's just, um, well, it's
not exactly what I expected.

16:39.150 --> 16:44.110
holly, I am so glad that I
have gotten to know rebecca--

16:44.120 --> 16:47.580
not st because that's what
william would have wanted.

16:47.590 --> 16:49.340
If he could see us now.

16:49.370 --> 16:52.880
Yes, baking a birthday
cake for his daughter.

16:52.890 --> 16:54.960
Yeah.

17:03.680 --> 17:04.520
What you doing?

17:04.530 --> 17:06.200
Oh, your mom wants dimmer switches.

17:06.210 --> 17:08.859
Dimmer switches? God, you guys are
getting more romantic every day.

17:08.869 --> 17:12.060
Yeah, unless I electrocute myself.

17:12.069 --> 17:13.619
So you guys are definitely
coming tonight, right?

17:13.650 --> 17:17.630
Yeah, yeah. Oh, um, speaking of which,
I know I should wait till your party,

17:17.640 --> 17:22.990
but I'd rather give you this when there's not
a lot of people I don't know waiting around.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.490
You didn't have to do that.

17:24.500 --> 17:26.780
Happy birthday.

17:28.250 --> 17:30.860
- well, I guess it's not a camera.
- No.

17:36.050 --> 17:38.390
You like it?

17:38.780 --> 17:41.350
- Thank you.
- Oh, yeah.

17:41.940 --> 17:44.540
Oh, that's gorgeous.

17:46.890 --> 17:49.160
I... I can pick up after
quadruple bogey, right?

17:49.170 --> 17:50.200
- yeah.
- Go ahead.

17:50.210 --> 17:51.570
Thank god.

17:51.580 --> 17:54.550
So, uh, you're, uh, basically
kicking our butts, isaac.

17:54.560 --> 17:55.280
Just lucky.

17:55.290 --> 17:56.360
No, you're good. You're good.

17:56.370 --> 17:59.790
And, uh, you're in good shape.
Your health's good, yeah?

17:59.800 --> 18:03.060
- Prostate's fine and everything's-- - oh,
jeez, tommy, come on.Even I think that's nosy.

18:03.070 --> 18:07.630
Excuse me, because I don't want mom spending her
golden years taking care of a man in poor health.

18:07.640 --> 18:08.880
Isaac, you know, I'm so sorry.

18:08.890 --> 18:11.240
Tommy's clearly mad 'cause his
game sucks compared to yours.

18:11.250 --> 18:13.410
Oh, screw you, kevin. What,
'cause I actually care about mom?

18:13.420 --> 18:15.110
Okay, you guys are
being a little intense.

18:15.120 --> 18:17.850
I'd like to dial it down and ask
him a few more real estate questions.

18:17.860 --> 18:20.560
oh, why, because you're
so concerned about mom?

18:20.570 --> 18:22.530
listen, fellas, listen.

18:22.540 --> 18:27.600
I know how much you love your mother, which
makes me very happy because I love her, too.

18:27.620 --> 18:31.180
That's why I'm gonna take
very good care of her.

18:33.770 --> 18:36.550
I'm glad we got that over with.

18:38.610 --> 18:40.570
- we're not trying to put you on the spot.
- Then don'T.

18:40.580 --> 18:41.330
Oh, come on, sarah.

18:41.340 --> 18:43.990
I just want you to see
what graham's been up to.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.850
Now ojai would be supplying 1,800
stores throughout mainland china.

18:48.890 --> 18:52.340
Now to make it work, you should probably take
a lease on a number of shipping containers

18:52.350 --> 18:53.690
between california and china.

18:53.700 --> 18:56.980
You're gonna need to step up
your contracts with local growers,

18:56.990 --> 19:00.050
as well as amp up your processing
and packaging capabilities.

19:00.060 --> 19:03.780
I think we should even think
about purchasing futures on fuels.

19:03.790 --> 19:05.920
Could you sit down?
You're making me dizzy.

19:05.930 --> 19:07.580
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- Sarah.

19:07.590 --> 19:10.080
Sorry. Look, just take a
look at it. It's all there.

19:10.090 --> 19:12.560
It just needs to be signed.

19:14.420 --> 19:17.580
We would need a huge cash injection
to fund this kind of expansion.

19:17.590 --> 19:18.710
Yeah, but that's the beauty part.

19:18.720 --> 19:21.180
He already secured a bank loan
to ojai for what, $20 million?

19:21.190 --> 19:23.780
Well, they we more than happy to do it on
the strength of the 10-store pilot deal.

19:23.790 --> 19:25.970
On top of which, golden
plum just sweetened the deal.

19:25.980 --> 19:28.180
They offered to pay 50%
in stocks instead of cash.

19:28.190 --> 19:32.510
The kicker being, with the dollar sinking,
you'd all own those profits in yuan,

19:32.520 --> 19:35.070
which would give you an
extra 2% in a currency play.

19:35.400 --> 19:41.610
Sarah, do you have any idea how many people
are begging me to get them into a deal in china?

19:43.170 --> 19:46.080
could i let you know tomorrow?

19:48.200 --> 19:50.670
- "Bloating, weight gain"...
- been there.

19:50.680 --> 19:53.290
- "Irritability, mood swings"...
- done that.

19:53.300 --> 19:55.150
"Facial--facial
hair"?

19:55.160 --> 19:56.960
I know.You know, when
robert lost the election,

19:56.970 --> 19:58.460
I thought he was gonna
do that thing, you know,

19:58.470 --> 20:00.540
that thing that they do-- they
gaiweight and they grow a beard?

20:00.550 --> 20:05.150
Well, turns out that I'm gonna
be the one looking like al gore.

20:05.160 --> 20:07.670
nora, delivery boy's here with the food.

20:07.680 --> 20:09.570
Oh, great, great.
Julia, would you help me?

20:09.580 --> 20:11.550
yeah, sure. we'll get that.

20:12.400 --> 20:14.080
- Hi, honey.
- Thank you.

20:19.460 --> 20:21.620
you mad at me, too?

20:21.630 --> 20:24.520
Uh, no. No, w-why
would I be mad at you?

20:24.530 --> 20:27.530
Well, I just spent an
afternoon with your brothers,

20:27.540 --> 20:31.470
and it seems you guys have some very strong
feelings about your mother moving away.

20:31.480 --> 20:35.410
Well, yeah. I think it would be weird if we didn't
have strong feelings about it, don't you think?

20:35.420 --> 20:40.870
I mean, she has decided, literally
overnight, to move 3,000 miles away.

20:40.880 --> 20:44.230
I mean, come on, even you have to
admit that it's happening pretty fast.

20:44.240 --> 20:47.110
Maybe, but your mother
seems pretty happy to me.

20:47.120 --> 20:49.900
Yeah, she is... now.

20:50.800 --> 20:55.150
isaac, this is a woman who
needs her family around her.

20:55.160 --> 20:59.030
If she goes through with
this move, I'm just--I'M...

20:59.340 --> 21:02.430
I'm afraid you're both gonna regret it.

21:02.440 --> 21:06.260
And--and my problem is, is that, you
know, I can't be the one to say it to her.

21:06.270 --> 21:11.170
Well, what do you want me to do, tell a
grown woman she doesn't know her own feelings?

21:11.180 --> 21:12.810
Well, feelings don't have
anything to do with it.

21:12.820 --> 21:15.900
They are not the problem. You have
clearly swept her off her feet.

21:15.910 --> 21:21.790
But I-I just know thgs about
my mother that you don'T.

21:21.830 --> 21:26.200
And if you did, I think you would
know that you're asking too much.

21:30.070 --> 21:32.820
I don't think I could
ever do what you're doing.

21:32.830 --> 21:33.560
What?

21:33.570 --> 21:37.270
I mean, just start a whole new life.

21:37.280 --> 21:39.390
I never thought I could do it either.

21:39.400 --> 21:41.770
What made us so afraid?

21:41.780 --> 21:45.120
And we always seem to take care
of everyone else, never ourselves.

21:45.140 --> 21:48.870
Well, I guess it started with mother.

21:48.880 --> 21:51.710
after that, everything was downhill.

21:51.720 --> 21:54.620
All the compromises we've made...

21:54.630 --> 21:57.140
saul, you have given
so much to this family.

21:57.150 --> 22:00.460
Turn the page. Do whatever
it is you have to do.

22:00.470 --> 22:04.270
You don't owe anything to anyone.

22:05.900 --> 22:07.090
Uh, I didn't mean to interrupt.

22:07.100 --> 22:09.910
Oh, isaac, you're not interrupting.

22:12.460 --> 22:14.710
Would you take this one out, please?

22:14.720 --> 22:16.980
Uh, s-sure.

22:18.670 --> 22:20.920
how you feeling? Y-you still excited?

22:20.930 --> 22:22.710
- About us?
- Yeah, I...

22:22.720 --> 22:25.440
I just wanted to make sure that
you've thought everything through.

22:25.450 --> 22:26.880
No, not at all.

22:26.890 --> 22:29.380
That's what's so exciting about it.

22:29.390 --> 22:31.870
I would understand if
you had second thoughts.

22:31.880 --> 22:32.960
What?

22:32.970 --> 22:37.200
Listen, nora, look at all those
people out there who love you.

22:37.210 --> 22:40.520
Oh, stop. They're still gonna love me.

22:40.530 --> 22:42.770
You're right.

22:43.140 --> 22:46.950
- I-I better get the lasagna out
here to the buffet. - All right.

22:50.440 --> 22:52.850
shouldn't we, uh, join
the rest of the party?

22:52.860 --> 22:55.360
No. I'm-- I'm kind
of avoiding saul.

22:55.370 --> 22:56.840
- Why?
- What's wrong? Nothing.

22:56.850 --> 23:02.560
I just--I don't want to talk business, and
he keeps wanting to sell me on your deal.

23:02.570 --> 23:04.520
He's a smart man.

23:04.530 --> 23:07.180
You're very sure of yourself,
aren't you, mr. Finch?

23:07.190 --> 23:09.460
That's what you pay me for.

23:09.470 --> 23:12.590
Sarah? Could you two get a room?

23:12.600 --> 23:14.240
We had a room till you came in here.

23:14.250 --> 23:16.090
Well, saul's lookin' for you guys.

23:16.100 --> 23:17.690
see? He's relentless.

23:17.700 --> 23:22.930
Well, I'll just, uh, tell him that I almost
had you sold, until, uh, we were interrupted.

23:27.470 --> 23:30.830
- So, uh, this is new.
- What?

23:30.840 --> 23:34.870
I'm just not used to you conducting business
with a guy's tongue down your throat.

23:34.880 --> 23:36.180
You have a proem with graham?

23:36.190 --> 23:38.700
No, he seems like a nice enough guy.

23:38.720 --> 23:40.770
So then what?

23:41.260 --> 23:44.680
It's just business and pleasure,
they don't-- they don't always mix.

23:44.690 --> 23:49.920
Oh, well, I seem to remember pretty famously
that you mixed your business with pleasure, so...

23:49.930 --> 23:51.630
maybe you shouldn't be the one to judge.

23:51.640 --> 23:55.440
I'm not judging. I'm
just concerned, okay?

23:55.450 --> 23:57.850
I'm a big girl.

24:02.470 --> 24:04.780
Save room for dessert.
That's all I have to say.

24:04.790 --> 24:06.820
Oh, I will.

24:06.830 --> 24:09.050
Where did you get that?

24:09.060 --> 24:11.290
- What, this?
- Yeah.

24:11.300 --> 24:13.990
David gave it to me for my birthday.

24:15.120 --> 24:15.910
You don't like it?

24:15.920 --> 24:19.390
No, I--it's
nice. It's lovely.

24:19.680 --> 24:21.500
Thanks.

24:25.600 --> 24:29.410
taylor's about to address
the republican values council.

24:29.740 --> 24:32.710
Pack of wolves, that bunch.

24:34.170 --> 24:39.920
every time I turn on the tv, he's
right there, cruising to the nomination.

24:40.400 --> 24:42.750
I really thought it was our time.

24:42.760 --> 24:46.150
You're gonna accomplish
a lot in the senate.

24:46.160 --> 24:50.030
Between you and me, it doesn't
feel like enough anymore.

24:50.040 --> 24:53.290
Well, don't quote me, uh, but...

24:53.300 --> 24:55.950
there's always next time.

24:56.950 --> 24:59.470
why would I ever put
myself through it again?

24:59.480 --> 25:02.770
I was never home. I was
always exhausted, hoarse.

25:02.780 --> 25:06.670
I had to listen to the most insulting
things said about me on a daily basis--

25:06.680 --> 25:10.420
you never had more fun in your life.

25:10.430 --> 25:14.770
Listen, let's--let's not talk
about any this with kitty.

25:14.780 --> 25:17.730
You know, we finally have some time
together, we're trying to start a family.

25:17.750 --> 25:22.500
The last thing she needs is to think
that I miss presidential politics.

25:22.510 --> 25:24.260
Maybe she misses it, too.

25:24.270 --> 25:28.680
No, no, she's, uh... she's moved on.

25:29.440 --> 25:31.800
But listen, she
deserves her life back...

25:31.810 --> 25:35.530
and without thinking that
I'd rather be somewhere else.

25:40.240 --> 25:42.970
oh, my god. It's from a store.

25:42.980 --> 25:45.280
So's the lettuce.

25:45.550 --> 25:49.260
This--this is really happening,
isn't it? She's leaving.

25:49.270 --> 25:51.670
I think she's already left.

25:54.430 --> 25:55.550
kevin, don't go there.

25:55.560 --> 25:57.440
what, um, what are we gonna do?

25:57.450 --> 26:00.650
Stop it. I cannot hold this
family together by myself.

26:00.660 --> 26:03.090
Don't make me slap you. Kevin?

26:03.100 --> 26:05.640
- Kevin, come on! Be a man!
- okay, okay.

26:05.650 --> 26:09.070
You didn't think that I
would recognize the necklace?

26:09.080 --> 26:10.560
It is your mother'S.

26:10.570 --> 26:12.230
You had me wear it in two movies.

26:12.240 --> 26:14.690
Now why wod you give her
your mother's necklace?

26:14.700 --> 26:15.970
Now what is the big deal?

26:15.980 --> 26:17.560
It's a family heirloom.

26:17.570 --> 26:19.130
What are you trying to say to her?

26:19.140 --> 26:20.540
Happy birthday?

26:20.550 --> 26:21.670
Why are you so touchy?

26:21.680 --> 26:24.600
Because it is the kind of necklace
you would give to a daughter.

26:24.630 --> 26:26.820
I just don't know what
you're trying to imply.

26:26.830 --> 26:30.250
I'm broke. I forgot to go
shopping. I had it at my place.

26:30.260 --> 26:32.460
But what do you think I'm
trying to imply, holly?

26:32.470 --> 26:36.520
Nothing. Let's just
get back to the party.

26:36.530 --> 26:39.600
Fine. Next time I'll give her a scarf.

26:47.740 --> 26:49.230
isaac?

26:49.240 --> 26:52.320
am I crazy, or have you
been avoiding me all night?

26:52.330 --> 26:54.420
Uh, I didn't mean to.

26:54.430 --> 26:57.900
Um, I--I've just been running
things over and over in my head.

26:57.910 --> 27:00.070
What things?

27:00.080 --> 27:04.240
I'm worried I rushed you into
this decision, that's all,

27:04.250 --> 27:06.980
before you were really sure.

27:06.990 --> 27:11.420
All right. Somebody got
to you-- one of the boys?

27:12.480 --> 27:14.200
- Kitty and I were talking...
- kitty?

27:14.210 --> 27:16.180
No, no, no. She--she made
some fair points, nora.

27:16.190 --> 27:19.010
You know, if she had those fair
points, why didn't she bring them to me?

27:19.020 --> 27:21.920
I guess she thought you might overreact.

27:27.170 --> 27:32.000
okay. Okay, rebecca, welcome
to your 22nd birthday...

27:32.010 --> 27:37.140
And your first birthday celebration in
the crowded bosom of the walker family.

27:37.190 --> 27:39.850
Now as guest of honor, you,
like all walkers before you,

27:39.860 --> 27:44.680
must suffer the ritual of the
embarrassing birthday toast.

27:48.650 --> 27:50.310
You started the toast without me?

27:50.330 --> 27:51.740
Well, sorry, mom, we couldn't find you.

27:51.760 --> 27:55.110
Yeah, and we thought we should
practice doing things in your absence.

27:55.120 --> 27:57.010
- Sarah, why don't you go ahead with your toast?
- Thank you.

27:57.020 --> 28:01.140
Okay, rebecca, there are many
reasons to celebrate this last year,

28:01.150 --> 28:04.330
not the least of which is those
bangs have finally grown out.

28:04.340 --> 28:05.550
Oh, sarah.

28:05.560 --> 28:06.890
I thought they were adorable.

28:06.900 --> 28:08.340
- They were dreadful.
- they were adorable.

28:08.350 --> 28:11.620
No, no, no. Don't let
them push you around.

28:11.630 --> 28:13.580
Oh, mom, nobody is pushing
anybody around, okay?

28:13.590 --> 28:14.890
We're just doing the birthday toast.

28:14.900 --> 28:17.260
Which I would like to finish so
that I can go pick up paige and coop.

28:17.270 --> 28:18.560
Why didn't you bring them with you?

28:18.580 --> 28:22.410
Because, mother, I would like to break it to
them privately that their grandma's moving away.

28:22.420 --> 28:24.050
Ooh, more collateral damage.

28:24.070 --> 28:26.140
- I think I'll go and let you talk among yourselves.
- Wait, isaac.

28:26.150 --> 28:28.190
Can we just do the toast, please,
for her birthday, everyone?

28:28.200 --> 28:29.550
You know, I've got a toast.

28:29.590 --> 28:34.360
Um, to--to rebecca, who is actually
happy for her mother and her new boyfriend

28:34.370 --> 28:38.000
and has made him feel like a
cherished part of their family.

28:38.010 --> 28:42.290
are you saying that we haven't
welcomed isaac? That's ridiculous.

28:42.300 --> 28:43.520
is this normal?

28:43.530 --> 28:44.630
I don't know. I'm new here.

28:44.640 --> 28:45.390
I'm gonna get some dessert.

28:45.400 --> 28:47.280
That's a good idea.
We'll ha some dessert now.

28:47.290 --> 28:48.470
- Oh, well, you can't have dessert.
- Why?

28:48.480 --> 28:50.540
It's birthday cake, and rebecca
hasn't blown out the candles.

28:50.550 --> 28:52.330
Nora, I'm not hungry,
and I want some coffee.

28:52.340 --> 28:55.020
- I'm gonna make some coffee.
- I'll check on the candles and the cake.

28:55.030 --> 28:58.250
- oh, I'd loveoffee.
- I'll get some wine.

29:00.450 --> 29:01.970
All right, mom, let's
just cut to the chase,

29:01.980 --> 29:04.260
and then maybe we can salvage
rebecca's birthday party, please?

29:04.270 --> 29:06.800
Sorry, rebecca, but we
are-- we are very worried

29:06.810 --> 29:10.190
that you are rushing into this
and maybe for the wrong reasons.

29:10.200 --> 29:11.170
yeah.

29:11.180 --> 29:14.800
Please enlighten me, oh, wise one.

29:14.810 --> 29:16.710
Okay.
Okay.I just--

29:16.720 --> 29:22.270
I think that we all are worried that
you are trying to replace dad with isaac.

29:22.280 --> 29:23.320
that's ridiculous.

29:23.330 --> 29:26.220
Leaving a family and the
life that you've built

29:26.230 --> 29:30.260
is a very drastic way of avoiding a
realization that you're afraid to be alon

29:30.270 --> 29:31.570
oh, my darling daughter,

29:31.580 --> 29:34.020
that is the biggest load of bull
crap I've ever heard in my life.

29:34.030 --> 29:37.240
- Can I--can I say
something? - no, no, no--

29:37.250 --> 29:40.010
no, no, kitty and I have
been talking about this...

29:40.020 --> 29:43.400
it's my turn, and
I'll tell you exactly--

29:43.410 --> 29:48.310
stop! Stop! Stop! Stop it!

29:48.740 --> 29:52.130
I'm not moving away because I
need to replace your father or--

29:52.140 --> 29:55.320
or I'm afraid to be alone or
whatever else you can think of.

29:55.330 --> 29:57.960
I'm leaving to get away from all of you!

29:57.970 --> 30:02.720
You think I don't notice all the eye-rolling and
sighing and little looks you give each other...

30:02.730 --> 30:04.800
every time I open my mouth?

30:04.810 --> 30:08.730
You're constantly complaining that
I'm manipulative and I'm controlling

30:08.740 --> 30:10.100
and I invade your lives.

30:10.110 --> 30:13.380
Well, take a good luck in the
mirror, my darling children.

30:13.390 --> 30:15.240
I try to change one thing in my life,

30:15.250 --> 30:20.290
and you all launch so many covert
actions, you might as well be the cia!

30:20.300 --> 30:23.390
Oh, god, it felt so good to
make a decision for myself

30:23.400 --> 30:28.580
without taking everyone else's
feelings into account. No.

30:29.210 --> 30:31.360
I'm doing this for me.

30:31.370 --> 30:35.350
And frankly, it's about damn time.

30:40.170 --> 30:44.310
None of this applies to you,
sweetie. You're fine. Happy birthday.

30:54.170 --> 30:55.530
yes?

30:59.030 --> 31:01.200
It's me...

31:01.210 --> 31:03.540
"oh, wise one."

31:03.550 --> 31:05.680
Is everybody gone?

31:05.690 --> 31:10.390
Uh, yeah. Yeah, pretty much the second
after rebecca blew out her candles.

31:10.400 --> 31:11.730
Where's isaac?

31:11.740 --> 31:15.410
Downstairs making some
calls. Do you want some help?

31:15.420 --> 31:18.700
No! Yes.

31:23.110 --> 31:26.410
You know, I-I thought that
everybody was being so selfish,

31:26.420 --> 31:30.540
and that I was the only one that
was concerned with your well-being.

31:30.970 --> 31:32.590
I'm sure your intentions were good.

31:32.600 --> 31:37.320
Well, no. No, I, uh,
I was the worst of all.

31:37.330 --> 31:42.620
I tried to get isaac to do my
dirty work, and... I'm sorry.

31:44.420 --> 31:46.750
When you moved to new york,
I was desperate to stop you,

31:46.760 --> 31:50.930
but I couldn't make myself say to my
own daughter, "please stay, I need you."

31:52.330 --> 31:56.770
Well, you know, at least you were
going towards something you want.

31:56.780 --> 31:59.640
I was just running away.

31:59.650 --> 32:01.470
Kitty, maybe I'm running away, too.

32:01.480 --> 32:03.600
Yeah, you're running away from us.

32:03.610 --> 32:07.080
No... from me. I...

32:07.090 --> 32:10.250
I was so young when I married your
father, and then I had all of you,

32:10.260 --> 32:16.040
and I-I guess I just never learned
how to en-- enjoy my own company.

32:16.760 --> 32:20.340
Even now, if I have news or-- or
something happens to me, good or bad,

32:20.350 --> 32:24.940
I just never feel like it's
actually happened until I...

32:24.950 --> 32:28.400
until I tell all of you.

32:28.420 --> 32:32.600
Maybe that's why we're so
lousy at keeping secrets.

32:34.550 --> 32:36.160
Do you love him?

32:36.170 --> 32:41.900
I mean, do you love isaac enough to
move all the way to washington, D.C.

32:42.320 --> 32:46.900
Well, I mean, whatever you
decide, it-- we love you.

32:48.560 --> 32:51.290
- Good night.
- Good night.

32:57.170 --> 33:00.370
Okay, wait.
Just--just--just-- I-I, um...

33:00.380 --> 33:05.060
I just don't want to
regret anything, so...

33:05.550 --> 33:10.070
please stay. I need you.

33:19.880 --> 33:24.640
oh, I should never have let
the walkers host her birthday.

33:24.650 --> 33:28.580
Their parties always
descend into a brawl.

33:28.590 --> 33:32.940
Yeah, it makes you wonder how somebody as
sweet as rebecca could be related to them.

33:33.760 --> 33:37.220
I am a little sick of
your innuendos tonight.

33:37.240 --> 33:40.750
Yeah, well, maybe I'm a lile sick
of being treated like an idiot.

33:40.760 --> 33:43.740
Oh, come on, holly. We've
been dancing around this.

33:43.750 --> 33:47.040
I'm telling you now,
if you have any doubt...

33:47.050 --> 33:52.300
if there is even the remotest possibility
that you don't know who her father is...

33:55.250 --> 33:58.010
there is a possibility.

33:58.020 --> 33:59.050
No. Remote!

33:59.060 --> 34:02.110
- So you--so you were
seeing both of us? - No.

34:02.120 --> 34:04.930
There was this one night,
and william and I had a fight,

34:04.950 --> 34:07.650
and I ended up at your place.

34:07.660 --> 34:10.239
Holly, you should have
told me this before.

34:10.250 --> 34:13.650
Rebecca has finally
got her life together.

34:13.659 --> 34:18.380
If she found out that I wn't 100%
sure that william was her father,

34:18.400 --> 34:20.120
we would never recover from that.

34:20.139 --> 34:23.690
She might never recover.

34:23.699 --> 34:28.250
I didn't come back here to
ruin her life... or yours.

34:28.260 --> 34:31.770
I-I came back here to be with you.

34:31.780 --> 34:37.360
Well, then can't we just leave
it at that then, for her sake?

34:38.980 --> 34:41.790
Please.

34:46.030 --> 34:49.540
good. You're awake.

34:49.550 --> 34:52.409
Yes, I couldn't sleep
after all the drama.

34:52.429 --> 34:54.650
Is that really what's keeping you up?

34:57.010 --> 34:58.740
no.

34:58.750 --> 35:01.470
Isaac, I don't want to make a mistake.

35:01.480 --> 35:03.470
It's so important.

35:03.480 --> 35:06.120
What you don't know about
me is how difficult it is--

35:06.130 --> 35:08.750
it's okay.

35:08.760 --> 35:11.520
You can't go to washington with me.

35:14.070 --> 35:19.050
I knew it was a long
shot, but I had to ask.

35:19.060 --> 35:21.780
I'm glad you did.

35:21.790 --> 35:24.930
I'm glad I did, too.

35:29.320 --> 35:31.100
I'm sorry your party was so lame.

35:31.110 --> 35:33.050
It had some funny moments.

35:33.060 --> 35:36.460
I especially liked the part where everybody
yelled at each other at exactly the same time.

35:36.470 --> 35:39.600
That was-- that
was pretty funny.

35:39.610 --> 35:42.960
You're right. it was awful.

35:44.020 --> 35:47.870
You know, I even saw your
mom arguing with david.

35:48.810 --> 35:50.950
Really? About what?

35:51.010 --> 35:53.420
Uh, about-- about
that necklace.

35:53.440 --> 35:57.000
I guess, like, it belonged
to his mother or something.

35:57.010 --> 35:58.860
He never told me that.

35:58.870 --> 36:02.300
Uh, yeah, yeah. She was,
uh, she was really pissed.

36:02.310 --> 36:07.810
She was, uh, accusing him
of... of--of implying, uh...

36:07.820 --> 36:10.300
implying what?

36:11.000 --> 36:12.960
Justin, implying what?

36:12.970 --> 36:16.210
Of im--of implying
that he's your father.

36:16.220 --> 36:18.980
Look, I know it sounds crazy, rebecca,
but I mean, have you ever thought that--

36:18.990 --> 36:20.510
of course I've thought about that.

36:20.520 --> 36:23.550
I mean, my--my mom always said that
my dad was this struggling director,

36:23.560 --> 36:26.770
and this guy shows up, this--this
struggling director, and--

36:26.780 --> 36:28.320
have you ever just
asked her point-blank?

36:28.330 --> 36:30.350
She completely denies it.

36:30.360 --> 36:31.890
And, you know, at first, I-I...

36:31.900 --> 36:35.780
I believed her, but the more
I see them together, I mean...

36:36.320 --> 36:39.400
look, I mean, if it's getting to you, why
don't you just get, like, a test or something?

36:39.410 --> 36:41.660
You don't think I want to?

36:41.670 --> 36:43.740
Honestly, justin, I...

36:43.750 --> 36:48.430
I don't know if I can just walk in to some
lab with--with what, his hairbrush? And...

36:48.440 --> 36:52.750
and find out that my
life is a lie... again.

36:54.130 --> 36:57.510
I just--I don't know
if I can handle that.

36:59.980 --> 37:03.170
What if I come with you?

37:09.590 --> 37:12.930
I'm keeping five people in shanghai awake
waiting to pull the trigger on this deal.

37:12.940 --> 37:16.430
- Saul, could you close the door, please?
- Sure.

37:19.630 --> 37:22.490
- Sarah, don't tell me-
- we can't do the deal.

37:22.500 --> 37:25.170
I can't be objective. I'm
emotionally involved with him.

37:25.180 --> 37:26.630
Okay, well, then let me be objective.

37:26.640 --> 37:28.770
I am telling you, this
is a fantastic deal.

37:28.800 --> 37:30.370
Look, I'm not gonna recuse myself.

37:30.380 --> 37:32.280
Do you have any idea how hard
graham has worked on this?

37:32.290 --> 37:35.480
Of course, it's what's killing
me, because actually, saul,

37:35.490 --> 37:39.270
it's good-- it's really
good-- between us,

37:39.280 --> 37:45.450
and I don't want my nixing this deal to
get in the way of this... thing we have.

37:45.460 --> 37:49.380
So it's fine for your thing to
get in the way of our business?

37:49.400 --> 37:54.000
Oh, come on, saul. We're family.
Nothing could come between us.

37:55.030 --> 37:57.800
Could you, um...

37:57.810 --> 38:02.070
make something up, get me off the hook?

38:02.080 --> 38:03.830
I'm sorrY.

38:03.840 --> 38:06.560
You know I'll take care of it.

38:07.040 --> 38:11.610
I mean, after all, what's one
more favor? We're family, right?

38:14.560 --> 38:16.780
Okay. Okay, go.

38:16.790 --> 38:18.850
No, wait, wait, wait! Just--just
wait. Wait, wait, wait.

38:18.860 --> 38:21.170
Just one--
one--just wait. Wait.

38:21.180 --> 38:23.140
Okay. Go.

38:23.640 --> 38:25.350
Done.

38:26.610 --> 38:29.010
- you did it?
- Yeah, it's done.

38:30.020 --> 38:32.090
You're really getting good at that.

38:32.100 --> 38:34.680
Maybe we should continue this
examination in the bedroom.

38:34.690 --> 38:36.060
You're such a republican.

38:36.070 --> 38:39.670
If we were democrats, we would just
be doing it on the couch. oh, wait.

38:39.680 --> 38:40.810
- Let it ring.
- No, no, no.

38:40.820 --> 38:45.520
It's probably my mom. Isaac's
leaving today. It's gonna be A...

38:47.400 --> 38:49.380
hello.

38:49.890 --> 38:52.750
Oh, no. No. Yes, of course.

38:52.760 --> 38:55.500
Sure. Sure.
I'll--I'll check.

38:56.170 --> 39:00.070
it's, uh, drew mccoy
from the taylor campaign.

39:04.380 --> 39:08.730
hey, drew. Yeah.

39:09.480 --> 39:13.450
Sure. 2:00's fine.

39:14.090 --> 39:16.740
Okay, I'll see you here.

39:18.190 --> 39:20.310
taylor has a campaign
stop in sacramento.

39:20.320 --> 39:23.080
- He wants to come here for a meeting.
- Oh, robert.

39:23.090 --> 39:25.120
It's just a meeting. We
don't know what this is about.

39:25.130 --> 39:27.460
Do you remember that
I do this for a living?

39:27.470 --> 39:29.040
This is about the ticket.

39:29.050 --> 39:32.810
He's reaching out to
you for the V.P.Spot.

39:35.640 --> 39:39.430
well, we'll cross that
bridge if we come to it.

39:42.220 --> 39:46.030
I wasn't really sure what you
needed, so I have his toothbrush and,

39:46.040 --> 39:49.720
um, some razor clippings in here, and I pulled
some gum from the garbage that he chewed.

39:49.730 --> 39:50.800
It's gross.I
know, but--

39:50.810 --> 39:53.320
I think I'll take the razor
clippings. That's probably best.

39:53.330 --> 39:56.760
I have to do a viability study first
to see if there's usable D.N.A.In here.

39:56.770 --> 39:57.590
I understand.

39:57.600 --> 40:00.570
And you know the results can't
be used in any legal forum.

40:00.580 --> 40:03.140
It's only for your own curiosity.

40:03.150 --> 40:05.870
- How accurate is it?
- Completely.

40:05.880 --> 40:08.540
- And when do I find out the results?
- We'll call you.

40:08.550 --> 40:11.560
So... you ready to get started?

40:18.840 --> 40:20.080
hello?

40:20.090 --> 40:22.910
Just wanted to hear your voice.

40:22.920 --> 40:24.770
I was thinking about you, too.

40:24.780 --> 40:28.300
Well, my flight doesn't
leave for a while.

40:28.310 --> 40:31.240
There's still time to change your mind.

40:31.700 --> 40:33.380
I've been changing my
mind every five minutes,

40:33.390 --> 40:37.650
which is a pretty good
indication that I should stay put.

40:37.660 --> 40:42.480
Ah, undecided voters tend
to go with the incumbent.

40:45.350 --> 40:47.810
don't say good-bye, okay?

40:47.820 --> 40:50.460
We're gonna see each other.

40:50.470 --> 40:53.760
- So long, then.
- So long, isaac.

40:54.130 --> 40:56.110
Fly safe.
