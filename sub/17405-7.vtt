00:11.880 --> 00:15.240
Tonight, I try a classic
Jaguar on our track.

00:16.320 --> 00:19.120
Hammond has a blast
in Mazda's new MX5.

00:20.440 --> 00:24.310
And James says, "Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow."

00:24.360 --> 00:26.160
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:33.720 --> 00:37.390
Thank you, everybody, thank
you so much, thank you!

00:37.440 --> 00:39.430
Hello, good evening.

00:39.480 --> 00:40.950
Thanks, everyone.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.710
Now, a couple of years ago Jaguar
gave us the F-Type convertible

00:45.760 --> 00:48.870
and now there's the F-Type coupe.

00:48.920 --> 00:51.670
You can have it with a
choice of two V6 engines

00:51.720 --> 00:56.150
or, for £85,000, a thumping great V8.

00:56.200 --> 00:58.740
So guess which one I've been driving?

01:00.000 --> 01:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:13.840 --> 01:15.710
Beautiful, isn't it?

01:18.480 --> 01:21.160
Beautiful enough to cause dribbling.

01:26.480 --> 01:29.070
And aggressive as well.

01:29.120 --> 01:31.190
Snarly.

01:31.240 --> 01:32.800
Angry.

01:37.280 --> 01:39.110
And unlike the soft-top F-Type,

01:39.160 --> 01:43.120
it comes with a boot, into
which you can put many things.

01:45.320 --> 01:48.710
All you could get in the boot of
a convertible is a peaked cap.

01:48.760 --> 01:52.310
But in here, there's room for
every conceivable type of hat,

01:52.360 --> 01:53.630
all at the same time.

01:53.680 --> 01:56.550
A boater, a fez, a
pith helmet, a trilby,

01:56.600 --> 01:59.070
one of James's special hats.

01:59.120 --> 02:02.750
And there's still room
leftover for a busby.

02:02.800 --> 02:04.600
There you go.

02:09.199 --> 02:12.510
And the good news keeps on coming.

02:12.560 --> 02:16.350
Because Jaguar has fiddled around
with the supercharged V8

02:16.400 --> 02:21.200
so it now produces 542 horsepower.

02:30.400 --> 02:34.310
That is 54 more than you
get in the convertible,

02:34.360 --> 02:38.110
which means this has a
top speed of a million.

02:38.160 --> 02:41.230
It is outrageously fast.

02:41.280 --> 02:44.840
I mean, that is 160mph.

02:47.160 --> 02:49.720
And I've got 17 hats in the boot.

02:52.760 --> 02:57.400
But even more impressive than the
speed is the way this car is made.

02:58.840 --> 03:02.950
They haven't simply bolted on
a roof - the whole side is new.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.150
And this is it.

03:04.200 --> 03:08.230
It's one piece of aluminium
and it only weighs...

03:08.280 --> 03:10.030
three and a bit kilograms.

03:10.080 --> 03:13.710
And because it's one piece,
there's more strength,

03:13.760 --> 03:16.360
more safety and less flex.

03:17.560 --> 03:20.720
And less flex means better handling.

03:33.120 --> 03:36.670
I thought the convertible
was good, but this...

03:36.720 --> 03:38.640
this is even better.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.350
It's actually got tougher
springs than the convertible

03:43.400 --> 03:46.270
which doesn't do much
for the ride but...

03:46.320 --> 03:48.990
God, it makes it fun
to drive out here.

03:57.400 --> 04:00.140
It is like driving
around in some poetry.

04:01.040 --> 04:04.040
Ted Hughes poetry, but
poetry nevertheless.

04:07.240 --> 04:11.150
This actually has an electronic
differential, which can overheat

04:11.200 --> 04:13.950
if you go too mad. But...

04:14.000 --> 04:16.190
providing you stay
within the parameters

04:16.240 --> 04:19.839
of reasonable common
sense, it's fabulous.

04:21.640 --> 04:24.640
I just don't know of another
car quite like this.

04:28.760 --> 04:30.830
And that's half throttle.

04:32.760 --> 04:34.500
Yes, you're good!

04:37.640 --> 04:42.070
So it's pretty and violent and fast

04:42.120 --> 04:44.920
and more practical than
you might imagine.

04:48.160 --> 04:52.550
Inevitably, however,
there are a few niggles.

04:52.600 --> 04:56.190
Number one, at oblique junctions
it's really hard to see

04:56.240 --> 04:58.070
if anything is coming.

04:58.120 --> 05:02.640
So pull up here at the edge
of our runway and look.

05:04.240 --> 05:08.190
The only way I can pull out safely
is by crossing my fingers

05:08.240 --> 05:10.590
and hoping for the best.

05:10.640 --> 05:12.680
Ah!

05:14.280 --> 05:16.120
Stupid idiot!

05:17.640 --> 05:19.780
There are other issues too.

05:20.720 --> 05:22.550
If you push the seat
all the way back,

05:22.600 --> 05:24.510
and if you're tall, you'll want to,

05:24.560 --> 05:28.060
the leather squeaks on the
bulkhead - can you hear that?

05:29.800 --> 05:31.540
Really irritating.

05:34.680 --> 05:37.710
And then there's the control
system, which is touch screen.

05:37.760 --> 05:39.710
Now that sounds fine

05:39.760 --> 05:43.430
but it's so bumpy in here,
at low speeds particularly,

05:43.480 --> 05:45.270
that it's very difficult
to get your finger

05:45.320 --> 05:47.110
to go in the right place.

05:47.160 --> 05:50.870
If you're not very careful when you
try to change the radio station,

05:50.920 --> 05:54.270
you can end up altering the colour
of the interior lighting

05:54.320 --> 05:58.920
or engaging Mad Mode on the
dynamic driving system.

06:00.240 --> 06:03.320
Aah! I wanted Classic FM!

06:06.720 --> 06:11.390
But the biggest problem with this
car is that it never stops shouting.

06:13.440 --> 06:17.070
You can push this button here
to quieten the exhaust system

06:17.120 --> 06:19.590
but every time you
go near the throttle,

06:19.640 --> 06:22.110
it all bursts back into life again.

06:25.120 --> 06:27.910
This car's a little bit like a
child that can play the violin.

06:27.960 --> 06:30.470
For five minutes, it's fine.

06:30.520 --> 06:34.990
But after a month, you might start
to suggest that if it doesn't stop,

06:35.040 --> 06:38.550
you will shove the sound
box right up its...

06:44.800 --> 06:46.590
Peace and quiet?

06:46.640 --> 06:49.520
That's not something
this car can ever do.

06:54.120 --> 06:58.790
Happily, however, there's another
new Jaguar which is a bit less...

06:58.840 --> 07:00.110
louty.

07:05.640 --> 07:10.430
A few years ago, we tested
this, the Eagle Speedster.

07:10.480 --> 07:14.920
And now the company that created
it has come up with something else.

07:19.600 --> 07:21.590
It's called the Low Drag GT

07:21.640 --> 07:26.510
and it's a re-creation of a one-off
racing E-Type prototype

07:26.560 --> 07:29.200
that Jaguar made in 1960.

07:41.240 --> 07:43.470
Except re-creation is the wrong word,

07:43.520 --> 07:47.150
because what Eagle has actually
done is taken the basic design

07:47.200 --> 07:51.790
and the spirit of the original
and then brought them up to date.

07:51.840 --> 07:55.280
Think of it, then, as a
Georgian house with Wi-Fi.

07:56.400 --> 08:00.200
And perhaps one of those Georgian
Clooney coffee machines.

08:04.040 --> 08:06.510
Let's start with the engine.

08:06.560 --> 08:09.510
Like the original, it's
a twin cam straight six.

08:09.560 --> 08:14.310
But unlike the original, it has fuel
injection rather than carburettors.

08:14.360 --> 08:15.900
So it works.

08:17.240 --> 08:21.520
It's made from aluminium rather
than cast iron, so it's light.

08:22.920 --> 08:26.320
It also has cooling so
it doesn't overheat.

08:27.360 --> 08:29.900
And it's bigger than the original...

08:31.040 --> 08:33.440
.. which means it's more powerful.

08:37.520 --> 08:44.230
The original car had 3.8 litres
and produced 265 horsepower.

08:44.280 --> 08:47.230
This has 4.7 litres

08:47.280 --> 08:52.230
and produces 345 horsepower!

08:52.280 --> 08:54.510
So it's faster...

08:54.560 --> 08:56.240
MUCH faster!

09:00.040 --> 09:03.630
To give you an idea of what
a rocket ship this car is,

09:03.680 --> 09:05.390
I'm going to have a drag race

09:05.440 --> 09:09.270
with Toyota's idea of
a modern-day sports car.

09:09.320 --> 09:11.560
The GT-86.

09:13.840 --> 09:18.430
Right, so a child of the '60s
versus the 21st century.

09:24.720 --> 09:27.840
Three, two, one, go!

09:30.840 --> 09:32.830
It's a smoking start.

09:32.880 --> 09:35.230
And we are away.

09:35.280 --> 09:37.390
That's incredible.

09:37.440 --> 09:41.720
Janis Joplin is punching
Justin Bieber in the face.

09:44.080 --> 09:46.910
And there's the finishing line.

09:46.960 --> 09:49.100
Yeah, it's an easy victory.

09:51.680 --> 09:54.310
I've always said things
were better in my day,

09:54.360 --> 09:55.910
apart from the rickets.

09:55.960 --> 09:59.670
And the diphtheria.
And this proves it.

09:59.720 --> 10:02.320
It's even pretty good in the corners.

10:15.600 --> 10:18.880
I'm not going to say this feels
modern because it doesn't.

10:22.960 --> 10:25.790
The F-Type would run rings around it.

10:25.840 --> 10:27.510
But crucially...

10:28.600 --> 10:31.310
.. it doesn't feel as old as me,

10:31.360 --> 10:33.230
which is what it is.

10:36.920 --> 10:39.310
But it's not the handling
or the power

10:39.360 --> 10:45.030
or the 170-mile-an-hour top
speed that impresses most.

10:45.080 --> 10:47.400
It's the attention to detail.

10:49.160 --> 10:52.430
I mean, because this car
has a five-speed gearbox

10:52.480 --> 10:54.950
rather than the four-speeder
you got in the original,

10:55.000 --> 10:58.510
Eagle has even made a special
gear knob to reflect that

10:58.560 --> 11:00.910
with a five on it.

11:00.960 --> 11:03.630
I'd have just used Tipp-Ex.

11:03.680 --> 11:06.870
And look at these sun visors.

11:06.920 --> 11:10.910
They're fabulous and somebody
had to make them and the bracket

11:10.960 --> 11:14.160
and the bolts that hold
it together and the hinge.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.590
That's, that's just...

11:17.640 --> 11:20.760
It's all just too
incredible for words.

11:22.120 --> 11:23.920
And there's more.

11:24.960 --> 11:27.790
The wheels - they look like
they're made out of steel

11:27.840 --> 11:29.790
and they came from a
motorist discount store,

11:29.840 --> 11:34.790
but actually they were specially
made by hand out of magnesium.

11:34.840 --> 11:37.750
And because the body
is Eagle's own design,

11:37.800 --> 11:40.550
this windscreen had
to be specially made.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.830
Now that meant going to a glassmaker

11:42.880 --> 11:46.750
and saying can you
make ONE windscreen?

11:46.800 --> 11:48.990
One!

11:49.040 --> 11:51.190
It cost £15,000.

11:51.240 --> 11:53.230
And the back window?

11:53.280 --> 11:55.760
That was £15,000 as well.

11:58.440 --> 11:59.790
As a result of all this,

11:59.840 --> 12:04.390
the Low Drag GT is quite a lot
more expensive than the F-Type

12:04.440 --> 12:08.790
and it's less nimble
and it's more slow.

12:08.840 --> 12:11.240
But I know which I'd rather have.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.880
Thing is, though...

12:27.880 --> 12:31.070
The tragedy is that the
only people who know

12:31.120 --> 12:33.310
how to make a windscreen like this,

12:33.360 --> 12:36.350
a one-off, are all now
in their 70s and 80s

12:36.400 --> 12:39.830
and when they retire, they will
take their skills with them.

12:39.880 --> 12:41.710
Which means that in
the very near future

12:41.760 --> 12:44.390
it just won't be possible
to make a car like this.

12:44.440 --> 12:47.150
No, I know and that'll be a
real shame, it really will.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.150
One thing I've been
trying to work out,

12:49.200 --> 12:51.510
cos you didn't actually
say it in the film,

12:51.560 --> 12:54.110
if that windscreen cost £15,000,

12:54.160 --> 12:56.150
how much is it for the whole car?

12:56.200 --> 12:57.950
A lot.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.830
How much a lot?

12:59.880 --> 13:01.470
£840,000.

13:01.520 --> 13:02.510
Ooh, that is a lot.

13:02.560 --> 13:05.870
~ No, but that does include VAT,
I should be clear on that.
~ Yeah.

13:05.920 --> 13:08.910
Nevertheless, you'll have to
agree the F-Type does represent

13:08.960 --> 13:10.110
better value for money.

13:10.160 --> 13:13.670
It does - especially the V6,
which is the one I'd buy.

13:13.720 --> 13:15.870
Because the V8, I mean
as I said in the film,

13:15.920 --> 13:19.550
it just never shuts up
- it would drive you mad.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.990
Yeah, it would, something
never shuts up,

13:22.040 --> 13:24.790
shouting constantly all day long.

13:24.840 --> 13:27.920
Rah, rah! With opinions and noise.

13:29.480 --> 13:31.550
Well, I'm just saying, I
mean it'll drive you mad.

13:31.600 --> 13:33.190
I can be quiet.

13:33.240 --> 13:34.630
Yeah, but only when you're asleep

13:34.680 --> 13:37.950
and thankfully I'm not
there for that so...

13:38.000 --> 13:43.430
Listen, I have just decided that I
don't want to talk to you any more.

13:43.480 --> 13:47.190
But what I do want to do is
find out how fast that F-Type

13:47.240 --> 13:48.430
goes round our track.

13:48.480 --> 13:53.230
And that of course means handing
it over to our tame racing driver.

13:53.280 --> 13:57.830
Some say that he wishes there
was someone he could talk to

13:57.880 --> 14:00.000
about his mis-sold PPI.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.800
And that he spent all week making
a stairlift for Madonna.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.820
All we know is he's called The Stig!

14:11.360 --> 14:15.190
And he's off, an un-smoky
start, which is a surprise,

14:15.240 --> 14:17.630
but very shouty, which isn't.

14:17.680 --> 14:21.590
Up to the first corner, lots of
squealing from the Pirelli tyres

14:21.640 --> 14:24.380
but he's keeping it
all in check nicely.

14:25.200 --> 14:27.230
That is neat.

14:27.280 --> 14:30.230
♪ Not a cloud in the sky

14:30.280 --> 14:33.590
♪ Got the sun in my eyes... ♪

14:33.640 --> 14:35.830
An appropriate slice

14:38.520 --> 14:40.390
Very together through Chicago.

14:40.440 --> 14:43.230
Let's see if there are
any tail-happy antics

14:43.280 --> 14:44.750
round the Hammerhead.

14:44.800 --> 14:48.600
Into the second part...
No, nothing so far.

14:49.720 --> 14:51.790
No, that is incredibly neat again.

he's right on the edge there,

15:05.520 --> 15:08.920
that won't raise the pulse of
either of The Stig's hearts.

Hard on the optional

corner, through Gambon

15:15.960 --> 15:17.830
and across the line!

15:20.600 --> 15:22.790
Right, then.

15:22.840 --> 15:24.440
What did it do?

15:26.400 --> 15:30.390
1.21.6 - which is as
fast as a Audi R8 V10

15:30.440 --> 15:34.030
and a Cayman GTS and...
What are you doing?

15:34.080 --> 15:37.950
~ I'm being quiet.
~ What?
~ I'm being quiet.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.110
~ This is...
~ I'm letting you know what
it's like to sleep with me.

15:42.600 --> 15:44.750
Oh!

15:44.800 --> 15:46.150
Oh...

15:46.200 --> 15:47.590
And now the news.

15:47.640 --> 15:50.110
And a couple of weeks ago,
we reported that Ferrari were

15:50.160 --> 15:53.630
warming to the idea of a test
to see which is the fastest -

15:53.680 --> 15:58.310
the Ferrari "The Ferrari", the
McLaren P1 or the Porsche 918.

15:58.360 --> 16:00.470
And the good news is...

16:00.520 --> 16:02.110
Ferrari have warmed.

16:02.160 --> 16:04.470
They have indeed. There
are a few stipulations -

16:04.520 --> 16:07.790
they've said that the test
must happen on neutral ground,

16:07.840 --> 16:10.150
which is fine, it's what
McLaren wanted as well.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.630
They've also said it must
be a factory prepared car

16:12.680 --> 16:14.510
which was a sticking
point with McLaren,

16:14.560 --> 16:17.030
but McLaren are now saying,
"That's OK, that's fine."

16:17.080 --> 16:19.270
And that means, ladies
and gentlemen, this...

16:19.320 --> 16:23.910
I think the most important test this
century is now going to happen.

16:27.760 --> 16:30.830
~ Oh, that is good.
~ I'm telling you honestly,

16:30.880 --> 16:32.630
we should go and sort out Ukraine,

16:32.680 --> 16:35.390
cos after this, it'd
be walk in the park.

16:35.440 --> 16:37.190
So when are we going to do it?

16:37.240 --> 16:39.270
~ What, sort out Ukraine?
~ No. The race.

16:39.320 --> 16:42.710
Oh, the race, well, as soon
as Porsche can find us a car.

16:42.760 --> 16:44.670
~ Find us a car?
~ Mm.

16:44.720 --> 16:46.270
Well, they made 918.

16:46.320 --> 16:49.390
~ I know, they've obviously lost them.
~ Have they?
~ Yes, they're now saying,

16:49.440 --> 16:51.270
"We haven't actually
got one at the moment,

16:51.320 --> 16:53.550
"but as soon as we do have
one, we'll let you have it."

16:53.600 --> 16:56.590
Then we can go ahead and see which
of those three incredible cars

16:56.640 --> 16:58.790
is the fastest. I cannot
wait, I really cannot wait.

16:58.840 --> 17:00.870
That's excellent, looking
forward to that.

17:00.920 --> 17:04.270
So that is good news. Er,
now, not such good news.

17:04.319 --> 17:06.950
You may have heard in the
news last week that Top Gear

17:07.000 --> 17:11.510
was attacked by Labour's transport
spokesman, a Mr Dugher.

17:11.560 --> 17:15.109
He says that Top Gear
is not representative

17:15.160 --> 17:19.190
~ of the motoring public in Britain.
~ No!
~ I know!

17:19.240 --> 17:22.670
~ We're not representative?
~ I know cos only this series, we have,

17:22.720 --> 17:27.589
if you think about it, we've raced
a hovercraft across St Petersburg.

17:27.640 --> 17:29.350
~ How representative is that?
~ Very.

17:29.400 --> 17:31.430
We've turned a Porsche
into an ambulance,

17:31.480 --> 17:34.590
~ we've driven a Bentley up the
side of an iron-ore mine...
~ Exactly.

17:34.640 --> 17:37.350
~ .. in Australia.
~ Exactly. Did he not enjoy these features?

17:37.400 --> 17:40.920
Difficult to say because he says
he doesn't watch Top Gear.

17:42.200 --> 17:45.190
Well, hang on, how does he know
if we're representative or not

17:45.240 --> 17:46.590
if he doesn't watch it?

17:46.640 --> 17:49.550
~ It's a good question. He
may have special powers.
~ OK.

17:49.600 --> 17:51.630
He could be a witch.

17:51.680 --> 17:54.750
~ The Tories aren't much better, are they?
~ Nice balancing work.

17:54.800 --> 17:56.230
~ Good work, thank you.
~ Thank you.

17:56.280 --> 17:59.950
This is excellent - BBC
even playing field.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.710
The Tory transport bloke, he said
that he didn't support the idea

18:02.760 --> 18:05.310
of an 80mph speed limit
on the motorway

18:05.360 --> 18:08.990
~ because of the road casualties
on one road in his constituency.
~ Mm.

18:09.040 --> 18:11.470
~ Which is the Derbyshire dales...
~ Yeah.

18:11.520 --> 18:14.190
Which doesn't have
any motorways in it.

18:14.240 --> 18:15.870
That's cos he's not a witch,

18:15.920 --> 18:18.870
~ he's an idiot.
~ All right, OK.
~ That's the difference.

18:18.920 --> 18:22.550
The annoying thing is, though,
that actually if you look behind

18:22.600 --> 18:24.110
the anti-Top Gear prejudice,

18:24.160 --> 18:26.950
Dugher is actually talking
a deal of sense.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.590
Because he says that when they're
deciding on transport policy,

18:30.640 --> 18:34.430
every government, Labour and Tory,
they talk to anti-car lobby,

18:34.480 --> 18:36.710
the... You know the cyclists
and the ramblers

18:36.760 --> 18:39.350
~ and the bus drivers and so on and so forth.
~ Yeah, and he's right.

18:39.400 --> 18:40.790
He is right which is ridiculous.

18:40.840 --> 18:43.190
He also says that all the people
who make the decisions

18:43.240 --> 18:46.030
are in central London and
have no idea what it's like

18:46.080 --> 18:48.990
~ for people trying to
get around in the regions.
~ And he's right on that.

18:49.040 --> 18:51.670
I know, and the tragedy is
we're telling him he's right

18:51.720 --> 18:54.230
and he's not watching cos he's
tuned into the Midwife thing

18:54.280 --> 18:56.870
~ on the other side.
~ Almost certainly, yeah.

18:56.920 --> 19:00.760
Which, incidentally, is not
representative of midwifery.

19:02.360 --> 19:04.700
~ Have you watched it?
~ No, never.

19:05.560 --> 19:07.870
I'm a witch as well.
I know these things.

19:07.920 --> 19:09.870
Ooh, now you may remember
a little while back

19:09.920 --> 19:13.110
we made some ambulances,
OK? And James turned up

19:13.160 --> 19:16.310
to make his ambulance out of
a Cosworth-powered hearse, yes?

19:16.360 --> 19:17.830
~ Do you remember that?
~ Yes.

19:17.880 --> 19:20.830
Somebody else, it turns out, is also
using a Cosworth-powered hearse

19:20.880 --> 19:23.080
as a hearse - got a picture.

19:24.840 --> 19:27.110
The same thing happened to
you. It's a design fault.

19:27.160 --> 19:29.110
~ I could have warned them.
~ Yes, exactly.

19:29.160 --> 19:31.030
~ I have news!
~ What news?

19:31.080 --> 19:33.750
~ Vauxhall has a new car!
~ No!
~ Wow.

19:33.800 --> 19:36.150
Yes! And here it is...

19:36.200 --> 19:38.270
Wow!

19:38.320 --> 19:40.270
They have called it the Viva.

19:40.320 --> 19:42.550
~ Viva?!
~ They've brought the name back, yeah, Viva.

19:42.600 --> 19:45.510
~ Does anybody remember the original Viva?
~ Oh, yeah.

19:45.560 --> 19:48.630
Anyone...? You're probably too
young. Let me remind you, OK?

19:48.680 --> 19:51.430
~ There's a picture of
it here, the original one.
~ Oh, God.

19:51.480 --> 19:53.990
~ Look at it!
~ Look at its silly little wheels.

19:54.040 --> 19:56.710
~ A style-free car.
~ It is ridiculous.

19:56.760 --> 19:59.590
Interesting, though - if they
were going to revive a name

19:59.640 --> 20:02.430
from Vauxhall's heritage and all
that, why would they choose Viva?

20:02.480 --> 20:05.150
I know, cos they had some great
names. They had Cresta,

20:05.200 --> 20:07.310
~ they had Victor.
~ Viceroy.

20:07.360 --> 20:09.590
They did a car called
the Prince Albert.

20:09.640 --> 20:11.510
No.

20:11.560 --> 20:14.430
~ No, it was the Prince Henry.
~ No, it's Prince Albert.

20:14.480 --> 20:19.150
No, Prince Albert, that's... It's
a ring they put through your chap.

20:19.200 --> 20:21.830
~ What, Vauxhall put it through your...?
~ No, no!

20:21.880 --> 20:23.230
People who for, I don't know why,

20:23.280 --> 20:25.830
but they do, it's a ring
they put through their chap.

20:25.880 --> 20:27.820
I thought it was a rod.

20:28.680 --> 20:31.070
Look, whatever it was,
it's not a Vauxhall.

20:31.120 --> 20:34.070
~ It wasn't a Vauxhall, they didn't...
~ Right, that's cleared that up,

20:34.120 --> 20:37.510
there was no Vauxhall Prince Albert.

20:37.560 --> 20:41.550
Oh, now it's the Geneva Motor
Show is currently on actually,

20:41.600 --> 20:43.550
which is an opportunity
for all the carmakers

20:43.600 --> 20:44.990
to demonstrate new concepts,

20:45.040 --> 20:48.150
all of which have
ridiculously large wheels

20:48.200 --> 20:50.790
that will never see the light
of day in production.

20:50.840 --> 20:52.590
Got some of them here for you.

20:52.640 --> 20:55.830
We have the Infinity Q60.
Look at the wheels on that,

20:55.880 --> 20:57.830
~ that's never going to happen in real life.
~ No.

20:57.880 --> 21:00.950
~ Nissan Sway. Again, no.
~ No.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.670
~ Look at the Audi Prologue.
~ God.
~ No.

21:03.720 --> 21:06.270
The idea is we look at that,
we go, "Wow, that's fantastic."

21:06.320 --> 21:08.590
Then of course the accountants
step into the mix

21:08.640 --> 21:11.150
and the accountants say
you can't have 46" rims.

21:11.200 --> 21:14.280
And you end up with a car that
actually looks like this.

21:15.760 --> 21:19.270
Supercar news from Geneva -
a couple I want to talk about.

21:19.320 --> 21:23.270
There's this, it's called
the EXP10 Speed 6.

21:23.320 --> 21:26.190
Oh, so EXP won against Speed.

21:26.240 --> 21:29.390
Oh, it's like football
results, EXP - 10...

21:29.440 --> 21:32.310
~ Speed - 6.
~ Yeah.
~ Yeah.

21:32.360 --> 21:35.550
That's actually well spotted.
Two-seater sports coupe.

21:35.600 --> 21:38.150
And they say, and I'm quoting
now, that "It is..."

21:38.200 --> 21:40.190
Er, make sure I get the quote right.

21:40.240 --> 21:41.990
".. unmistakably a Bentley."

21:42.040 --> 21:45.070
But if you look at it from the side,

21:45.120 --> 21:48.430
I think you'll agree that is
unmistakably an Aston Martin.

21:48.480 --> 21:52.110
~ Er, it is. ~ Yes.
~ That's an Aston Martin. ~ Exactly.
~ Yes, it is.

21:52.160 --> 21:55.670
Well, meanwhile, actually, the real
Aston Martin have come up with this,

21:55.720 --> 21:59.110
which is an 800 horsepower,
it's a track day car

21:59.160 --> 22:01.190
but they've called it the Vulcan.

22:01.240 --> 22:02.710
~ The Vulcan?
~ The Vulcan.

22:02.760 --> 22:05.350
So it only takes off
from RAF Waddington

22:05.400 --> 22:08.630
and then it refuels in the Ascension
Islands and then carries on...

22:08.680 --> 22:11.110
~ Um...
~ No, let's not go there.

22:11.160 --> 22:13.030
I don't think... Leave that.

22:13.080 --> 22:15.510
Have you seen this?

22:15.560 --> 22:19.070
It's a Fiat 500, it's a limited
edition thing they're doing.

22:19.120 --> 22:21.950
But what puzzles me is they've
chosen to put an image

22:22.000 --> 22:24.830
of the original 500 on the side
of it, that's the original.

22:24.880 --> 22:28.310
That's just idiotic cos that's like
saying "Look how fat I've become!"

22:28.360 --> 22:29.790
Well, yeah. It's...

22:29.840 --> 22:32.310
You don't see Eamonn Holmes
sunbathing with a diagram

22:32.360 --> 22:35.190
on his belly of what he used to
look like as a teenager, do you?

22:35.240 --> 22:38.310
"Look at me! I used to be only
this thin and now I'm enormous."

22:38.360 --> 22:41.030
Which is what they've done.
I don't know what that's for.

22:41.080 --> 22:43.150
Oh, now, big news.

22:43.200 --> 22:45.830
There's a car called
the Suzuki Celery...

22:45.880 --> 22:48.350
~ Er, isn't it the Celeriac?
~ Whatever, you don't want one.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.710
We've got a picture of it here.
Now there's a British...

22:50.760 --> 22:52.590
~ I don't want one.
~ No, it's hideous.

22:52.640 --> 22:54.950
A British motoring magazine
were testing one of these

22:55.000 --> 22:56.350
and it had total brake failure,

22:56.400 --> 22:58.270
so Suzuki sent them
another one to test,

22:58.320 --> 22:59.910
exactly the same thing happened.

22:59.960 --> 23:03.510
~ The pedal went to the floor both times.
~ Nasty.
~ Very nasty.

23:03.560 --> 23:05.830
So Suzuki took it away to
work out what was wrong.

23:05.880 --> 23:08.270
And they discovered that there's
a safety system on that,

23:08.320 --> 23:11.070
so that in the event of a crash,
the brake pedal is pulled away

23:11.120 --> 23:13.790
from your foot so it doesn't
bounce up and damage your shin.

23:13.840 --> 23:17.150
~ Oh, yeah.
~ But, if you were braking very hard,

23:17.200 --> 23:19.310
it would assume you
were going to crash

23:19.360 --> 23:21.550
and then pull the brake
pedal away from you.

23:21.600 --> 23:24.430
In that yawning instant, I mean we've
all been there at some point,

23:24.480 --> 23:26.710
~ when you think you're
going to have a crash...
~ Mm.

23:26.760 --> 23:28.870
.. they take away the
only thing in the world

23:28.920 --> 23:31.430
that actually is of any
consequence or importance...

23:31.480 --> 23:33.670
~ The only thing you understand.
~ Yes, exactly.

23:33.720 --> 23:35.350
Suzuki admit that was a mistake.

23:35.400 --> 23:37.470
Well, it was, I mean
it was a mistake.

23:37.520 --> 23:39.790
They do admit that was a mistake
and all credit to them,

23:39.840 --> 23:41.350
very quickly, in just ten days,

23:41.400 --> 23:43.750
they've got them all sorted out.

23:43.800 --> 23:45.870
They did a recall, effectively.

23:45.920 --> 23:49.070
And they've said... I love this,

23:49.120 --> 23:51.920
They've said, "Sales
won't be affected."

23:53.080 --> 23:54.590
What? Er, really?

23:54.640 --> 23:58.160
No, they say, "Most of our target
audience is more mature.

23:59.320 --> 24:01.950
"The public understand
that recalls happen

24:02.000 --> 24:04.030
"and they'll see through
the stories."

24:04.080 --> 24:07.230
Yeah, just to translate that,
what they're actually saying is

24:07.280 --> 24:12.230
most of our target audience is
old and daft and won't notice.

24:12.280 --> 24:18.630
Now, let's move on and it is time
now to talk about the Mazda MX5.

24:18.680 --> 24:23.190
When this, the original model,
came out 25 years ago,

24:23.240 --> 24:27.750
it immediately saved the small
roadster from extinction

24:27.800 --> 24:31.710
and went on to become THE most
successful two-seater sports car

24:31.760 --> 24:33.190
of all time.

24:33.240 --> 24:37.880
But now there's a new MX5 and I
went to Humberside to drive it.

24:42.960 --> 24:48.000
Before I do that, though, time for
a quick refresher with the original.

24:50.880 --> 24:54.510
The reason this car was so
brilliant is that it's light,

24:54.560 --> 24:56.960
it's small and it's simple.

24:58.960 --> 25:00.710
Mazda were perfectly open about

25:00.760 --> 25:05.230
cribbing all the best bits
from '60s MGs and Lotus Elans

25:05.280 --> 25:08.270
and leaving out all the worst bits.

25:08.320 --> 25:13.230
The recipe wasn't complicated
- small engine at the front,

25:13.280 --> 25:14.910
rear wheel drive

25:14.960 --> 25:18.830
and a perfect 50/50
weight distribution.

25:18.880 --> 25:21.510
They were so obsessed
with that last point,

25:21.560 --> 25:24.830
they even moved the
battery to the boot.

25:24.880 --> 25:27.830
There isn't a lot on this
car but everything that is

25:27.880 --> 25:32.710
is done well. The gear change - short
snappy throws from gear to gear

25:32.760 --> 25:35.160
and a little click as it goes in.

25:36.160 --> 25:38.190
25 years on

25:38.240 --> 25:43.230
and this is still in the top five
all-time great gear changes...

25:43.280 --> 25:45.720
if there is such a thing.

25:49.080 --> 25:51.350
God, these things were good

25:51.400 --> 25:55.110
which means that the brand-new
MX5 has got a lot to live up to,

25:55.160 --> 25:56.760
a helluva lot.

26:00.440 --> 26:02.670
Well, here it is.

26:02.720 --> 26:06.270
And on paper, the signs are good.

26:06.320 --> 26:08.550
It's still usefully small.

26:08.600 --> 26:12.990
It's still got an engine at the
front and drive to the rear.

26:13.040 --> 26:16.630
And since prices start
at around £19,000,

26:16.680 --> 26:19.880
it's still more affordable
than most sports cars.

26:27.360 --> 26:31.030
Another encouraging sign is that
they've resisted the temptation

26:31.080 --> 26:32.630
to give it a bigger engine.

26:32.680 --> 26:35.310
The biggest you can get is two litres

26:35.360 --> 26:38.270
and the one I'm in is a 1.5.

26:38.320 --> 26:41.950
That means nought to 60 in
just under nine seconds,

26:42.000 --> 26:44.470
about the same as the original,

26:44.520 --> 26:47.950
and a top speed of 125,

26:48.000 --> 26:51.030
which is absolutely fine.

26:51.080 --> 26:53.550
In fact, it's good news.

26:53.600 --> 26:57.750
An MX5 shouldn't be a snorting
monster of a thing,

26:57.800 --> 26:59.870
it's a car for driving
into the countryside

26:59.920 --> 27:03.120
on a nice sunny day to
find a nice pub for lunch.

27:04.800 --> 27:06.310
And it's great!

27:06.360 --> 27:10.160
Squeezing every last drop out
of this little 1.5 litre engine.

27:13.360 --> 27:16.100
Use all the engine's
got and... Come on!

27:17.520 --> 27:19.830
Whip the pony a bit.

27:19.880 --> 27:22.870
Then there's the handling.

27:22.920 --> 27:25.430
The front suspension is
still double wishbones,

27:25.480 --> 27:27.990
the weight distribution is
still balanced perfectly,

27:28.040 --> 27:30.040
50/50 front to rear.

27:33.240 --> 27:37.470
Immediately, you can just sense
everything is in the right place,

27:37.520 --> 27:41.720
the relationship between where
it all sits in the car is correct.

27:43.840 --> 27:47.310
This car isn't about wrestling
a monster through turns

27:47.360 --> 27:49.900
and being relieved when you survive.

27:50.600 --> 27:52.790
I'm not trying to win a fight,

27:52.840 --> 27:55.840
it's human being and machine
working together.

27:56.880 --> 28:00.080
That - the way it changes
direction there, turn in...

28:02.640 --> 28:04.580
.. it feels so nimble.

28:09.040 --> 28:13.790
The reason the new MX5
is so nimble is because

28:13.840 --> 28:17.550
whilst most cars get fatter
with every new generation,

28:17.600 --> 28:22.880
this one is almost 100 kilos lighter
than the car it replaces.

28:24.200 --> 28:26.310
100kg, that's...

28:26.360 --> 28:29.750
Well, it's nearly an
entire Jeremy Clarkson.

28:29.800 --> 28:32.590
That's a significant weight saving.

28:32.640 --> 28:35.670
Mazda has achieved this feat
by employing something called

28:35.720 --> 28:38.040
the gram strategy.

28:39.640 --> 28:44.230
Now this is not to be confused with
the business plan from Scarface.

28:44.280 --> 28:50.470
What it means in Mazda-land is
shaving off a gram here and there.

28:50.520 --> 28:54.670
For instance, in any car there's
bits of the glass that you can't see

28:54.720 --> 28:57.590
hidden inside the body,
hidden inside the doors.

28:57.640 --> 28:59.350
Glass is heavy.

28:59.400 --> 29:03.750
So Mazda have made holes and
taken out pieces of that glass.

29:03.800 --> 29:06.470
And if you just shave off
a gram here and there,

29:06.520 --> 29:10.110
those grams add up
to become kilograms.

29:10.160 --> 29:12.270
But despite the minimalism,

29:12.320 --> 29:15.630
you don't feel like you're
sitting in a prison cell.

29:15.680 --> 29:18.830
It's a nice place to be. I've
got, well, everything I need.

29:18.880 --> 29:22.230
Touch screen, sat nav, it
interfaces with my telephone,

29:22.280 --> 29:25.470
all of that stuff... It's a car.

29:25.520 --> 29:28.350
So far, then, all is well.

29:28.400 --> 29:30.670
But before I get too carried away,

29:30.720 --> 29:34.920
there are a couple of not-so-good
things about this new MX5.

29:36.840 --> 29:39.630
The first problem is not really
the car's fault at all

29:39.680 --> 29:44.070
but I should mention it.
It's the image of the MX5.

29:44.120 --> 29:47.230
Put it this way, if your business
is called A Cut Above,

29:47.280 --> 29:49.830
Fringe Benefits or Hair Apparent,

29:49.880 --> 29:52.390
this has long been the
choice of car for you.

29:52.440 --> 29:56.190
But if you run a magazine called
Belt-Fed Machine Gun Enthusiast,

29:56.240 --> 29:58.590
you'd probably want
to look elsewhere.

29:58.640 --> 30:01.230
The second problem is the looks.

30:01.280 --> 30:02.630
I can see what they've done -

30:02.680 --> 30:04.990
they've given a cute
little car a frown,

30:05.040 --> 30:07.070
it's the whole angry puppy thing -

30:07.120 --> 30:09.520
but I'm just not quite sure, yet.

30:13.880 --> 30:15.670
But, you know what?

30:15.720 --> 30:21.560
These are tiny ripples in what is
otherwise an ocean of brilliance.

30:22.560 --> 30:25.230
Oh, I love this thing
- it's brilliant.

30:27.080 --> 30:28.750
It's pure fun.

30:28.800 --> 30:30.720
It's made of fun.

30:33.920 --> 30:35.520
Listen to that!

30:36.480 --> 30:39.750
I know when I get back to the studio,
Jeremy's going to be standing there

30:39.800 --> 30:41.630
pointing at an Alfa Romeo 4C

30:41.680 --> 30:44.630
saying, "This is the
lightweight car to have."

30:44.680 --> 30:46.550
But it's 50 grand!

30:46.600 --> 30:48.750
And they make a fuss
about it being light.

30:48.800 --> 30:51.080
This is just simple.

30:56.320 --> 30:59.840
I love this. I'm just
made up with this.

31:09.360 --> 31:11.470
See? There you are.

31:11.520 --> 31:14.910
I, I knew it. I knew you'd do that.

31:14.960 --> 31:16.950
I said so in the film.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.150
But, look, the fact is
you could buy two MX5s -

31:19.200 --> 31:22.190
no, two and a half - for
the price of one Alfa.

31:22.240 --> 31:24.430
Yes, but the Alfa Romeo is lighter.

31:24.480 --> 31:25.630
How do you know?

31:25.680 --> 31:27.830
Every time we ask Alfa
how much it weighs,

31:27.880 --> 31:29.390
they send us a different number.

31:29.440 --> 31:33.070
They did, cos they're not troubled
with specific details like that.

31:33.120 --> 31:35.630
If you build a car that's
as much fun as this

31:35.680 --> 31:37.950
with a carbon fibre tub chassis,

31:38.000 --> 31:40.950
you take it for a drive,
you don't weigh it.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.430
When Leonardo da Vinci
painted the Mona Lisa,

31:43.480 --> 31:45.870
he didn't say, "I wonder
how much that weighs..."

31:45.920 --> 31:49.990
The whole point of the Alfa, we're
told, is its lack of weight,

31:50.040 --> 31:52.950
that's why they tell us it feels
a bit flimsy and a bit brittle

31:53.000 --> 31:55.470
and it hasn't got power steering
because it's so light.

31:55.520 --> 31:57.870
But then they won't tell
us how light it actually is.

31:57.920 --> 31:59.590
Because they're too busy having fun.

31:59.640 --> 32:02.150
Mazda made that and then went,
"I wonder how many horsepower

32:02.200 --> 32:04.750
"it produces? Let's put it on
a rolling road and weigh it."

32:04.800 --> 32:06.550
Why don't they just
make the figures up?

32:06.600 --> 32:08.150
That's what the Italians always do.

32:08.200 --> 32:09.430
They do!

32:09.480 --> 32:12.550
Right, once Alfa finally give us
the convertible version of this,

32:12.600 --> 32:15.950
let's get it together with the Mazda
and we'll sort out which is best.

32:16.000 --> 32:20.590
Good idea, but now we must put a
Star in our Reasonably Priced Car.

32:20.640 --> 32:23.910
Now, my guest tonight
came to fame as a boy,

32:23.960 --> 32:27.350
and then he was a sort of blue monster,
and then he was a zombie -

32:27.400 --> 32:32.030
all of which means I don't know
what he looks like in real life.

32:32.080 --> 32:36.230
So, ladies and gentlemen, somewhere
over there is Nicholas Hoult!

32:38.160 --> 32:39.760
You! It's you.

32:40.960 --> 32:42.390
It is you.

32:42.440 --> 32:43.950
How are you and your...?

32:44.000 --> 32:45.870
Very well, very well.

32:46.400 --> 32:48.800
~ That's actually you?
~ This is it.

32:49.640 --> 32:51.590
Your ears, your nose
- excellent have a seat.

32:51.640 --> 32:52.990
Yes, yes, yes. Thank you.

32:53.040 --> 32:56.870
No, cos you very rarely
see you as you.

32:56.920 --> 32:59.230
Yeah, I have a habit of
wearing a lot of make-up.

32:59.280 --> 33:02.790
In films, not in real
life. Generally.

33:02.840 --> 33:06.350
To remind you, this was you in About
A Boy, obviously, when you were...

33:06.400 --> 33:08.150
~ Aww!
~ Yeah.

33:08.200 --> 33:10.630
~ Sweet is the word I'm looking for.
~ Thank you.

33:10.680 --> 33:12.910
~ And then you were blue.
~ Oh, yeah, yeah.

33:12.960 --> 33:15.830
Again, hard to recognise
you now from...

33:15.880 --> 33:18.550
Is this a good thing?
Does the anonymity...?

33:18.600 --> 33:20.230
Well, I did sneak around.

33:20.280 --> 33:23.430
I did get off on the streets
in that costume a little bit.

33:23.480 --> 33:26.350
Um, I ran across a golf
course at one point.

33:26.400 --> 33:28.590
I went hooning it. Three
people were playing,

33:28.640 --> 33:30.430
and I went running across
this golf course,

33:30.480 --> 33:32.150
and they turned and saw that coming

33:32.200 --> 33:35.200
and they were like, "Oh,
Lord, it's happening."

33:36.040 --> 33:38.590
And I pulled up and said, "Remember
to swing through the ball,

33:38.640 --> 33:40.550
"keep your eye on the back
of it at all times,"

33:40.600 --> 33:42.270
then I turned around
and ran off again.

33:42.320 --> 33:43.990
And you could see them
just so confused.

33:44.040 --> 33:46.590
Was that while you were actually
filming or is that something

33:46.640 --> 33:47.870
you keep at home for fun?

33:47.920 --> 33:50.190
~ Well, I've got the feet from that at home.
~ Have you?

33:50.240 --> 33:51.950
Yeah. Well, actually, no, I haven't,

33:52.000 --> 33:55.600
my mum kept them, cos she likes
to wear them as slippers.

33:55.960 --> 33:59.150
Now, you've been, even from
when you were a boy-boy,

33:59.200 --> 34:01.350
you've been a petrol head
since you were that age?

34:01.400 --> 34:03.590
I have, yeah. I grew
up watching this show.

34:03.640 --> 34:06.790
~ So, you were watching this as
a... When you were in About A Boy?
~ Yeah.

34:06.840 --> 34:09.550
God, that makes me
feel about a thousand.

34:09.600 --> 34:11.150
Cos it's weird, I haven't changed...

34:11.199 --> 34:14.230
I mean, you've changed a lot,
but I'm exactly the same now

34:14.280 --> 34:16.110
as I was when we first started.

34:16.159 --> 34:17.949
So you must have been thrilled, then,

34:18.000 --> 34:20.630
if you were a car enthusiast
from a young age,

34:20.679 --> 34:23.310
to have been offered a part in
the new Mad Max movie, I presume,

34:23.360 --> 34:25.949
which is - as we know
from the early ones -

34:26.000 --> 34:27.670
~ a lot of cars.
~ Yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:27.719 --> 34:30.350
That was supposed be an
Australian accent - rubbish.

34:30.400 --> 34:32.429
Yeah, cos I loved the original films.

34:32.480 --> 34:35.270
And then, it's the weirdest
thing, you'd be there on set,

34:35.320 --> 34:37.790
and they'd have these armadas
of all these vehicles

34:37.840 --> 34:39.830
that they'd specially
made for the shoot,

34:39.880 --> 34:41.510
all these V8s, V12s, all roaring.

34:41.560 --> 34:44.389
And you'd be sitting there in your
car, and flames of all these other

34:44.440 --> 34:47.830
cars would go flying past you, guys
on bikes, and you just get chills.

34:47.880 --> 34:50.830
But the only problem with it
is you can't hear anything

34:50.880 --> 34:52.590
cos the engines are all so loud.

34:52.639 --> 34:54.750
You'd sit there, and then
you'd see the camera

34:54.800 --> 34:56.469
kind of come into your periphery,

34:56.520 --> 34:58.430
and then you'd hear
a bang on the roof,

34:58.480 --> 35:00.470
and that was maybe someone
saying their line.

35:00.520 --> 35:02.950
So you're just kind of guessing
when to act, essentially.

35:03.000 --> 35:06.430
Just hoping for the best, not knowing
exactly where you were in the film.

35:06.480 --> 35:07.830
We've actually got a clip.

35:07.880 --> 35:09.710
Let's have a look at
the new Mad Max movie.

35:09.760 --> 35:11.360
My name is Max.

35:25.600 --> 35:28.000
Oh, what a day! What a lovely day!

35:58.040 --> 36:00.830
That does look like my kind of film,
I think all our kinds of films.

36:00.880 --> 36:03.230
We would... Yeah, I'll be
queuing up for that one.

36:03.280 --> 36:06.230
But the car has survived, the
Mad Max...? It's a Ford Falcon.

36:06.280 --> 36:08.950
That's still there. It gets adapted
a little bit in this one.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.950
This was amazing, like, the attention
to detail in all of these.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.510
My car, they had four versions
of it, because they had to flip

36:14.560 --> 36:17.470
and roll and do all sorts of
stuff, but each one had, like,

36:17.520 --> 36:19.950
my character's name, Nux,
engraved into the brake pad

36:20.000 --> 36:21.270
and all these sorts of things.

36:21.320 --> 36:23.110
When you got in there
everything worked

36:23.160 --> 36:26.390
and had a reason to be there, they'd
had really thought about everything.

36:26.440 --> 36:29.230
So there's no CGI in this, then?
It really is roll a car over?

36:29.280 --> 36:31.070
Yeah, they were really
going for it, yeah.

36:31.120 --> 36:33.350
Well, I mean, that just sounds
like my idea of heaven.

36:33.400 --> 36:35.710
It was... Yeah, you think
it's your idea of heaven

36:35.760 --> 36:37.910
until they're crashing trucks
into the back of you.

36:37.960 --> 36:39.670
And you do the first
take and you're like,

36:39.720 --> 36:42.390
"Yeah, I'm fine, don't worry about
it, do it faster, go for it."

36:42.440 --> 36:44.750
And then the next time
you turn around mid-scene,

36:44.800 --> 36:47.510
you look over your shoulder and
there's this truck flying at you,

36:47.560 --> 36:50.750
and you're like, "Boof!", getting
thrown around inside, trying to act.

36:50.800 --> 36:53.070
You are quite accident prone
on films, are you not?

36:53.120 --> 36:55.750
Cos when you were on X-Men...
Cos you've got Fassbender on...?

36:55.800 --> 36:56.830
Yeah, Fassbender.

36:56.880 --> 36:59.030
Cos he told some amazing
stories of what you got...

36:59.080 --> 37:00.590
Racing golf buggies when he was...

37:00.640 --> 37:03.150
Oh, yeah, him and James crashed
a golf buggy and caused

37:03.200 --> 37:05.830
quite a lot of damage to themselves
and one of the cars on set.

37:05.880 --> 37:06.990
Yeah, he did mention that.

37:07.040 --> 37:09.230
You didn't get involved
in the golf buggy racing?

37:09.280 --> 37:11.350
Well, they took them away after that.

37:11.400 --> 37:13.310
We'd do a little bit
of golf buggy racing.

37:13.360 --> 37:15.750
So then, our next one,
on the last film

37:15.800 --> 37:18.670
me and James went and bought BB
guns and we'd shoot each other.

37:18.720 --> 37:20.550
So you'd be riding
to set in the morning,

37:20.600 --> 37:22.350
you'd put your goggles
on, load your clip,

37:22.400 --> 37:24.550
you'd get out of the car and
then, before you knew it,

37:24.600 --> 37:27.150
there were three people, like,
chasing you to your trailer.

37:27.200 --> 37:29.430
~ Shooting you?
~ Yeah, but then we had to stop that

37:29.480 --> 37:31.150
cos people got shot in the face.

37:31.200 --> 37:33.070
And you'd bleed.

37:33.120 --> 37:34.990
I was going to say it would
leave an ugly mark.

37:35.040 --> 37:37.630
Yeah, it would welt or bleed, so
we got told we weren't allowed

37:37.680 --> 37:39.230
~ to do that any more, either, so...
~ Aw!

37:39.280 --> 37:41.430
Don't know what we're going
to do on the next one.

37:41.480 --> 37:44.390
Is that why you've
now taken up knitting?

37:44.440 --> 37:45.590
Yeah!

37:45.640 --> 37:46.950
Oh, the knitting, yeah.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.630
On Mad Max, there was
a lot of hanging around,

37:49.680 --> 37:51.870
so one of make-up artists
was knitting one day

37:51.920 --> 37:54.310
and I was like, "That seems
like a good way to kill time."

37:54.360 --> 37:56.110
So, I'd sit there,
sit there knitting,

37:56.160 --> 37:58.870
and then getting really frustrated
with myself when I'd mess up,

37:58.920 --> 38:00.790
like, storming around
the set being like,

38:00.840 --> 38:02.910
"Argh! Can someone fix my...

38:02.960 --> 38:04.070
"..knitting?"

38:04.120 --> 38:05.390
"Please."

38:05.440 --> 38:07.390
And then they'd fix it
up, I'd go, "Thank you,"

38:07.440 --> 38:09.750
and I'd go back off to
my corner and sit there.

38:09.800 --> 38:12.900
I started, like, taking
orders from other people.

38:14.200 --> 38:15.550
~ And then...
~ Beast can knit.

38:15.600 --> 38:17.390
Two of the girls on Mad
Max asked for hats,

38:17.440 --> 38:18.510
and I was like, OK.

38:18.560 --> 38:21.270
I had one day off and I was like,
I've got to make these hats.

38:21.320 --> 38:23.230
So I knitted straight
for ten hours that day

38:23.280 --> 38:24.710
without really stopping.

38:24.760 --> 38:27.110
And then I quit, I haven't
knitted since, cos I was like,

38:27.160 --> 38:28.870
this is too much, it's
not fun any more.

38:28.920 --> 38:31.750
Have you heard of Call Of Duty?
That's brilliant for killing time.

38:31.800 --> 38:34.310
I kill weeks with Call Of Duty.
Knitting? Well, there we are.

38:34.360 --> 38:36.070
Now, it's time to
get on to your cars,

38:36.120 --> 38:38.910
cos we've established you like
a car, and you've driven many.

38:38.960 --> 38:40.830
You've driven a
Murcielago, haven't you?

38:40.880 --> 38:42.670
Yeah, I got to drive
one in Singapore.

38:42.720 --> 38:44.710
I was shooting a film
in Singapore last year.

38:44.760 --> 38:46.710
That's a beast, it was
proper Lambo beast days.

38:46.760 --> 38:47.910
Yeah, it shifted.

38:47.960 --> 38:50.230
But your first car wasn't
any of those things.

38:50.280 --> 38:51.510
It was similar.

38:51.560 --> 38:53.110
It was a Fiat Grande Punto.

38:53.160 --> 38:54.430
~ Punto?
~ In red, yeah.

38:54.480 --> 38:55.710
It's a mean car.

38:55.760 --> 38:57.790
1.4 litres of mayhem. It
was good, I enjoyed it.

38:57.840 --> 38:58.870
~ 1.4?
~ Yeah.

38:58.920 --> 39:00.270
Whoa, that's a beast.

39:00.320 --> 39:04.110
And then, presumably,
in a Fiat Punto,

39:04.160 --> 39:06.590
police interruptions
in your driving...?

39:06.640 --> 39:07.710
Yeah, yeah, one.

39:07.760 --> 39:09.910
I've never got a speeding
ticket on anything,

39:09.960 --> 39:13.060
not on my bike, nothing,
apart from in the Punto.

39:14.360 --> 39:16.630
And the max speed on
that thing is 103,

39:16.680 --> 39:19.950
and I think I was doing under
that. I'm pretty sure.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.710
And I suddenly saw the blue lights
and I was like, "Oh, no."

39:22.760 --> 39:23.990
Pulled over, and he was like,

39:24.040 --> 39:25.870
"I've been chasing
you for a while now,

39:25.920 --> 39:28.590
"and I had to do 120, maybe
130 to catch up with you,

39:28.640 --> 39:30.710
"so you were definitely
doing faster than that."

39:30.760 --> 39:32.110
And I was like, "Well...

39:32.160 --> 39:33.470
"the logic is off."

39:33.520 --> 39:35.150
He said he was doing
120 to catch you up

39:35.200 --> 39:37.070
so you must have been
doing more than that?

39:37.120 --> 39:39.230
Yeah, and I was like, "This
doesn't make any sense.

39:39.280 --> 39:41.990
"Of course you were going faster
than me, you were chasing me."

39:42.040 --> 39:43.630
Did you say you had a bike?

39:43.680 --> 39:45.760
Yeah. Yeah, a Ducati 899.

39:47.200 --> 39:49.630
Not interested in bikes.
Anyone interested in bikes?

39:49.680 --> 39:50.750
Yeah.

39:50.800 --> 39:52.400
Oh, God! Um...

39:53.520 --> 39:55.030
Erm... do you ride it?

39:55.080 --> 39:57.620
Yeah, I ride it around, it's lovely.

39:57.840 --> 39:59.350
Um...

39:59.400 --> 40:01.070
Is it...? What colour is it?

40:01.120 --> 40:02.590
It's white.

40:03.200 --> 40:04.400
Yeah.

40:05.880 --> 40:08.670
Can we stop talking about bikes now?
I want to talk about his laps.

40:08.720 --> 40:12.350
~ Oh, no!
~ No, no. You know last week
we had Gillian Anderson here?

40:12.400 --> 40:15.910
And she did set a new
record of 22 practice

40:15.960 --> 40:18.990
or attempts at the fastest time.
Do you know how many you did?

40:19.040 --> 40:20.390
Uh, no, I wasn't...

40:20.440 --> 40:21.980
~ 24!
~ Did I?!

40:23.800 --> 40:27.030
No, but, you know, I
had lots going on, so...

40:27.080 --> 40:30.310
But it is... It's an awful
thing to say, I know,

40:30.360 --> 40:32.350
but it was a beautiful day today.

40:32.400 --> 40:33.830
Well, yeah, it looked beautiful -

40:33.880 --> 40:36.870
strong headwinds throughout
the whole lap, so...

40:36.920 --> 40:39.790
Not a breath of wind, just
a crisp, cool, sunny,

40:39.840 --> 40:42.150
beautiful, perfect
day for a car to go...

40:42.200 --> 40:44.310
Yeah, that's what everyone
kept on saying.

40:44.360 --> 40:46.830
And I was sitting there in
the car and I was sweating,

40:46.880 --> 40:50.270
and everyone's first thing out their
mouths was, "Perfect day for it."

40:50.320 --> 40:52.230
~ Yeah.
~ And you're like, oh...

40:52.280 --> 40:54.230
Anyway, who would like
to see Nicholas's lap?

40:54.280 --> 40:55.750
Yes.

40:55.800 --> 40:57.600
Let us have a look.

41:01.440 --> 41:03.710
~ Loves it!
~ Vigorous.
~ Loves it!

41:04.000 --> 41:06.470
Race mode engaged.

41:06.520 --> 41:08.270
Idiot driving - perfect.

41:08.320 --> 41:10.310
Well, we shall see.

41:10.360 --> 41:11.830
Coming up to the first...

41:11.880 --> 41:13.350
Oh, crikey!

41:14.000 --> 41:15.830
Oh, God almighty, that is quick.

41:15.880 --> 41:17.870
It looks quick but I don't
know if it actually is.

41:17.920 --> 41:21.110
~ That does look quick through there.
~ It felt like I was going as fast as I could.

41:21.160 --> 41:23.920
Up to third, hang it out, turn it in.

41:26.920 --> 41:29.070
And, I have to say, sometimes we say

41:29.120 --> 41:31.030
if you go slowly it
looks quick but...

41:31.080 --> 41:33.750
I saw Ricciardo bouncing up and down.

41:33.800 --> 41:36.340
I don't know if that helps the speed.

41:37.480 --> 41:40.670
No, cos normally when a car
is apparently going slowly

41:40.720 --> 41:43.670
it's sometimes quick, but this
looks faster than normal.

41:43.720 --> 41:45.920
And that's very nicely done.

41:48.280 --> 41:49.630
That was a gear change.

41:49.680 --> 41:51.630
Strong winds.

41:51.680 --> 41:53.620
Not visible on screen.

41:56.120 --> 41:58.390
Flat through there, obviously.

41:59.200 --> 42:01.470
Oh, that is right to the edge!

42:02.080 --> 42:04.550
And that's cutting it fine nicely.

42:04.600 --> 42:06.920
And now just two corners left.

42:08.080 --> 42:09.710
Coming in on a shallow angle,

42:09.760 --> 42:14.190
but no real problems with
the second to last, Gambon.

42:14.240 --> 42:17.240
A lot of understeer there,
but across the line!

42:18.400 --> 42:20.400
Ah-ha!

42:23.440 --> 42:25.440
What do you think, then?

42:27.440 --> 42:30.480
Where do you think you've
come on the board?

42:31.640 --> 42:32.830
Huh.

42:32.880 --> 42:34.750
I'd, I'd, I mean...

42:34.800 --> 42:38.270
Obviously, for X-Men bragging
rights, I'd like to be somewhere

42:38.320 --> 42:40.510
around Hugh Jackman, but
that's really high up.

42:40.560 --> 42:42.070
Where's Hugh?

42:42.120 --> 42:44.350
He's 1:46.1.

42:44.400 --> 42:47.710
I'd like to be in the
late 1:40s somewhere.

42:47.760 --> 42:49.590
Late 1:40s. Well, let's have a look.

42:49.640 --> 42:51.510
I don't know.

42:51.560 --> 42:53.470
Nicholas Hoult, you did it in 1...

42:53.520 --> 42:54.680
Oh.

42:55.760 --> 42:57.030
.. 40...

42:57.080 --> 42:58.950
OK, that's all right.

43:02.920 --> 43:03.990
.. 4...

43:04.040 --> 43:05.550
~ Ooh!
~ Oh, that's good.

43:05.600 --> 43:07.670
Told you it looked quick.

43:12.240 --> 43:13.390
Ah!

43:13.440 --> 43:14.630
..7.

43:14.680 --> 43:16.320
Oh!

43:17.560 --> 43:19.510
Tenth off, a tenth off.

43:21.240 --> 43:22.780
But there...

43:25.000 --> 43:27.440
Come on. Come on.

43:28.600 --> 43:30.510
That is a tenth...

43:30.560 --> 43:32.430
Olly Murs is like...

43:33.120 --> 43:34.830
But that is a very...

43:34.880 --> 43:36.880
I mean, it looked quick.

43:37.800 --> 43:39.070
It looked quick.

43:39.120 --> 43:41.910
It's really difficult to get a
lap where everything goes right.

43:41.960 --> 43:44.670
No, that is... That's a time
to be proud of, 1:44.7.

43:44.720 --> 43:46.510
~ Thank you so much for coming.
~ Thank you.

43:46.560 --> 43:48.150
Absolute pleasure to have you here.

43:48.200 --> 43:50.740
Ladies and gentlemen, Nicholas Hoult!

43:58.520 --> 44:01.470
Now, a few series
ago, the three of us

44:01.520 --> 44:04.030
tried our hand at amateur Rallycross,

44:04.080 --> 44:06.390
and we decided that, pound for pound,

44:06.440 --> 44:09.110
it is the most exciting
sport in the world.

44:09.160 --> 44:12.710
And, because we enjoyed
the amateur event so much,

44:12.760 --> 44:15.150
the logical next step
was for one of us

44:15.200 --> 44:18.390
to take it to a professional level.

44:18.440 --> 44:21.430
Clearly, there was only
one steely-eyed helmsman

44:21.480 --> 44:23.820
to take on this challenging job.

44:24.480 --> 44:25.680
Him.

44:33.080 --> 44:35.470
When we did our amateur Rallycrossing,

44:35.520 --> 44:38.990
we raced here, at
Lidden Hill in Kent,

44:39.040 --> 44:42.630
and our cars were plucked from
the pages of the classifieds

44:42.680 --> 44:44.550
for just a few quid.

44:46.280 --> 44:48.110
Well, the venue is the same.

44:48.160 --> 44:50.790
This is where the event will
be taking place tomorrow.

44:50.840 --> 44:52.580
The car, though...

44:53.400 --> 44:55.470
That's a bit of a step up.

44:56.400 --> 44:58.910
It starts out as a VW Polo,

44:58.960 --> 45:01.350
but then becomes this -

45:01.400 --> 45:03.950
a 2-litre turbo-charged Tornado

45:04.000 --> 45:09.000
with 600 horsepower and more
torque than a Ferrari 458.

45:13.200 --> 45:15.630
And, to keep the drivers
on their toes,

45:15.680 --> 45:18.710
helping hands such as
traction control, ABS

45:18.760 --> 45:21.500
and electronic
differentials are banned.

45:23.400 --> 45:24.870
Now, I know what you're thinking -

45:24.920 --> 45:26.830
you're thinking that's
not a racing car,

45:26.880 --> 45:30.390
it's merely a vehicle providing
Top Gear viewers with hilarious

45:30.440 --> 45:31.670
Captain Slow cock-ups.

45:31.720 --> 45:34.390
But no, I might actually
be OK at this.

45:36.680 --> 45:40.230
For starters, the circuits
are small and easy to learn.

45:40.280 --> 45:43.470
The cars do have four-wheel drive.

45:43.520 --> 45:45.870
And then there's the
calibre of the drivers.

45:45.920 --> 45:48.710
One of them is the son of the
bloke who owns this track,

45:48.760 --> 45:52.910
and another is just a presenter
on American Top Gear.

45:52.960 --> 45:55.590
And it's the Top Gear
chap - Tanner Foust -

45:55.640 --> 45:58.840
who has kindly offered to
train me for this event.

46:00.160 --> 46:02.830
Is it really 600 horsepower,
or is that bar talk?

46:02.880 --> 46:04.790
It's a full-on six.

46:04.840 --> 46:06.630
It's 300 horsepower per litre,

46:06.680 --> 46:09.990
0-100 km in 1.9 seconds.

46:10.040 --> 46:12.990
It's quicker than a Formula
One car off the line.

46:13.040 --> 46:14.990
~ Wow.
~ Then the other things about it, you know,

46:15.040 --> 46:18.270
you've got all-wheel drive,
it's amazingly stable,

46:18.320 --> 46:21.910
you'll see a jump and it just
completely absorbs them,

46:21.960 --> 46:23.430
it's like marshmallow.

46:23.480 --> 46:25.750
It's mostly carbon fibre,
Kevlar underneath.

46:25.800 --> 46:27.030
There's a lot of contact.

46:27.080 --> 46:28.710
I think it's the only
sport in the FIA

46:28.760 --> 46:31.390
where there's not a rule saying
you can't hit other cars.

46:31.440 --> 46:33.990
~ So you can hit other cars?
~ It happens, yeah.

46:34.040 --> 46:38.830
'Tanner then pointed out the most
important thing on the dashboard.'

46:38.880 --> 46:42.390
This switch here, this is the
monster switch right here.

46:42.440 --> 46:45.710
This is the one that is the
ALS, for the anti-lag system.

46:45.760 --> 46:48.550
~ This is for the turbo chargers?
~ Yeah.
~ Yes.

46:48.600 --> 46:52.070
Once you flip that switch,
all hell breaks loose.

46:52.120 --> 46:54.830
Now every time you lift off the
throttle, it's shooting flame

46:54.880 --> 46:58.110
through the turbo, keeping
it spinning over 200,000 rpm.

46:58.160 --> 46:59.270
Mmm.

46:59.320 --> 47:01.550
And it's a very violent thing,

47:01.600 --> 47:04.350
and that's really what
makes this car work.

47:04.400 --> 47:06.670
~ OK.
~ Once you cross the finish line,

47:06.720 --> 47:09.190
you flip that off and then
it's a normal car again.

47:09.240 --> 47:10.750
So that, remember that...

47:10.800 --> 47:13.990
It's really weird talking to someone
who is a Top Gear presenter

47:14.040 --> 47:15.550
but who is really helpful.

47:15.600 --> 47:18.390
~ Usually it's sarcasm and stupidity...
~ We're team mates.

47:18.440 --> 47:22.030
.. but you're being informative,
helpful, encouraging -

47:22.080 --> 47:23.750
it's quite nice.

47:24.920 --> 47:28.200
'Tanner then offered to take
me for a demonstration run.'

47:29.960 --> 47:33.110
I did mean to tell you, actually,
I fell off a horse quite recently.

47:33.160 --> 47:35.270
~ OK.
~ And my bones are still a bit sore,

47:35.320 --> 47:38.030
so try not to, you know, snap me
in half or anything like that.

47:38.080 --> 47:39.320
OK.

47:45.160 --> 47:47.900
Hold the brakes, then
lets it all off...

47:49.760 --> 47:51.300
~ Holy
~ BLEEP!

47:53.240 --> 47:54.840
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

47:58.720 --> 48:00.880
Aaaaaaaargh!

48:13.800 --> 48:15.270
Ow, ow, ow!

48:18.560 --> 48:22.110
'45 seconds later, my spin
in the Rallycross tumble dryer

48:22.160 --> 48:24.230
'came to a merciful end.'

48:27.120 --> 48:29.590
'And then it was my turn to drive.'

48:30.240 --> 48:33.600
Full throttle, and release
the clutch a little...

48:37.720 --> 48:39.310
Faster, faster, faster, faster.

48:39.360 --> 48:40.750
'For the next few hours...'

48:40.800 --> 48:42.070
Brake and full throttle.

48:42.120 --> 48:44.110
'.. my new friend from
American Top Gear

48:44.160 --> 48:46.560
'gave me some excellent tuition.'

48:49.080 --> 48:51.270
Second gear, second gear, brake.

48:51.320 --> 48:53.430
No, wrong way.

48:53.480 --> 48:55.030
Brake, brake, brake, brake, brake.

48:55.080 --> 48:58.480
That way, that way. Brake,
brake, brake, brake, brake.

48:59.680 --> 49:01.310
Sorry about that, by the way.

49:01.360 --> 49:03.300
Hey, no harm, no foul.

49:03.960 --> 49:05.630
'He then took the time to explain

49:05.680 --> 49:09.230
'the considerable
complexities of the racing.'

49:09.280 --> 49:12.350
So, there's 12 cars, and
then there's five heats.

49:12.400 --> 49:14.830
~ Right.
~ But there's four laps in each heat.

49:14.880 --> 49:16.870
You won't just drive
once, you go twice.

49:16.920 --> 49:18.830
Like, maybe two or three times.

49:18.880 --> 49:23.710
So, it's 50 points for the
guy in first, 45 and then 40.

49:23.760 --> 49:26.590
Then there's two semifinals...

49:26.640 --> 49:29.390
'Tanner said that, no matter
how I did in the heat,

49:29.440 --> 49:32.030
'I'd be in one of the semifinals.

49:32.080 --> 49:34.430
'Then he explained the joker lap.'

49:34.480 --> 49:37.750
But in every one of these
you do the joker lap once,

49:37.800 --> 49:40.470
which is the long outside,

49:40.520 --> 49:42.030
outside of turn one,

49:42.080 --> 49:43.950
with a bit of a jump
on the way in there.

49:44.000 --> 49:47.350
~ OK, so I have to take the
joker lap once per race?
~ Exactly.

49:47.400 --> 49:50.390
Here's the thing with the jokers
- at least three seconds slower.

49:50.440 --> 49:52.590
Ideally, you would take
the joker lap sometime

49:52.640 --> 49:55.750
if you're behind somebody and
you need to get free track.

49:55.800 --> 49:57.230
And what if you forget?

49:57.280 --> 49:59.470
That's why the spotter is critical.

49:59.520 --> 50:00.710
What's a spotter?

50:00.760 --> 50:05.030
So, on top of this building there'll
be one spotter per car

50:05.080 --> 50:07.590
that'll be on the radio,
in your headset,

50:07.640 --> 50:10.070
and they'll be able to talk
to you while you're driving,

50:10.120 --> 50:11.950
when to take the joker,
who's behind you,

50:12.000 --> 50:13.070
what position you're in,

50:13.120 --> 50:15.670
give you information that you
need while you're on the track.

50:15.720 --> 50:18.030
It's quite a responsible
job, the spotter, then.

50:18.080 --> 50:20.030
~ Yeah, they have to pay attention.
~ Yeah.

50:20.080 --> 50:22.470
I think I've... Can you just
go through that again,

50:22.520 --> 50:23.630
to make sure I've got it?

50:23.680 --> 50:26.590
12 cars total, we're all here to
race five times, four laps each,

50:26.640 --> 50:30.240
30-second penalty if you take
the joker more than once...

50:32.720 --> 50:37.150
The next morning, as all the other
teams prepared for race day,

50:37.200 --> 50:41.240
I was in Tanner's garage getting
to know a bit more about my car.

50:42.680 --> 50:44.430
Look at the size of this.

50:44.480 --> 50:47.030
That's not a standard
air filter, obviously.

50:47.080 --> 50:50.160
~ None of that is standard,
this isn't standard...
~ May?

50:51.280 --> 50:53.020
~ Morning.
~ Morning.

50:53.880 --> 50:55.190
What are you doing here?

50:55.240 --> 50:58.710
Well, we're told you need spotters,
apparently - we are your spotter.

50:58.760 --> 50:59.950
No, no, no, no.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.270
No. Spotting is a genuinely
important job.

51:02.320 --> 51:04.750
You have to say who's in front
of you, who's behind you...

51:04.800 --> 51:06.910
~ Well, nobody's behind you, obviously.
~ Funny(!)

51:06.960 --> 51:09.110
When to do the joker lap -
do you know about the joker?

51:09.160 --> 51:11.710
~ Is there a jump?
~ There's a jump.
~ And we tell you when to do that?

51:11.760 --> 51:13.470
~ Yeah, so when do I do it?
~ Now!
~ I don't know.

51:13.520 --> 51:16.110
~ Which lap do I do the joker lap on?
~ I don't know.
~ Well, exactly.

51:16.160 --> 51:17.550
~ How many laps are there?
~ Four.

51:17.600 --> 51:18.710
I mean, can I just...?

51:18.760 --> 51:21.350
I got out of bed this morning
at 5:15 to be here.

51:21.400 --> 51:24.110
He stayed in a Ramada Inn
last night with Lenny Henry.

51:24.160 --> 51:26.270
And this is how ungrateful he is.

51:26.320 --> 51:29.350
Seriously, I've done a minimal
amount of practice yesterday,

51:29.400 --> 51:31.110
and I don't want two
Muppets helping me.

51:31.160 --> 51:32.630
I'm sorry to be rude, but no.

51:32.680 --> 51:34.790
James, James! Your door's
not shut properly.

51:34.840 --> 51:37.380
~ Good spot, good spot, Hammond.
~ Yeah.

51:37.840 --> 51:40.790
Since I seemed to be stuck
with Pinky and Perky,

51:40.840 --> 51:44.120
we went to watch some of the
other drivers in the first race.

51:45.840 --> 51:48.710
They don't half start off
close together, don't they?

51:48.760 --> 51:50.550
~ You could crash by there!
~ Yeah.

51:50.600 --> 51:52.200
This'll be you.

52:12.680 --> 52:16.670
'Yesterday with Tanner, I thought
maybe a podium was a possibility.

52:16.720 --> 52:19.590
'But, now I was watching
the real racing...

52:20.720 --> 52:23.120
'.. I decided to aim a bit lower.'

52:23.680 --> 52:27.110
I think maybe a better
personal ambition would be

52:27.160 --> 52:28.230
not to be lapped.

52:28.280 --> 52:31.150
~ Does that happen a lot in this?
~ I don't think it's ever happened.

52:31.200 --> 52:34.700
You can't be lapped in Rallycross,
it's only four laps.

52:36.760 --> 52:40.150
So, in four laps, if they're
doing a 50-second lap,

52:40.200 --> 52:44.550
if you're more than 12 seconds
a lap slower than them,

52:44.600 --> 52:48.030
you're in the Guinness Book
of Records as the first person

52:48.080 --> 52:50.420
EVER to be lapped in Rallycross.

52:51.840 --> 52:56.190
'On that sobering thought, James
lined up for his first heat,

52:56.240 --> 53:00.240
'which featured drivers of a higher
calibre than he'd been expecting.'

53:01.800 --> 53:04.110
Petter Solberg is an extremely good,

53:04.160 --> 53:06.270
former world champion rally driver,

53:06.320 --> 53:07.990
~ and a world champion at this.
~ Yes.

53:08.040 --> 53:10.390
Timmy Hansen is 22.

53:10.440 --> 53:14.350
He was third in European
Rallycross last year.

53:14.400 --> 53:17.400
~ And James May.
~ James May, 52-year-old piano player!

53:18.680 --> 53:20.750
Interested in lathes!

53:20.800 --> 53:23.540
'As the drivers prepared
for the off...'

53:24.920 --> 53:27.190
'.. we were testing the comms.'

53:29.960 --> 53:32.960
~ Put him in the mood.
~ Yeah. Yeah, I'd say that.

53:35.600 --> 53:38.600
Turn the radio down, you're
blowing my ears out.

53:40.560 --> 53:42.430
Gosh, why did I agree to this?

53:42.480 --> 53:46.120
I've got Petter Solberg next to me
and a load of drivel in my ears.

53:49.120 --> 53:51.270
~ Oh, this is unbelievably exciting.
~ Is he going?

53:51.320 --> 53:55.320
~ He's going, he's going!
~ Oh, my God. James, it's about to start.

53:57.280 --> 53:59.590
They've started, they've started.

53:59.640 --> 54:02.380
They've started, James!
They've started!

54:05.120 --> 54:07.590
Quite muddy there, James,
it is quite muddy.

54:07.640 --> 54:09.040
Shut up!!

54:12.200 --> 54:15.720
James? James, so that you know,
the car behind you is French.

54:17.760 --> 54:21.190
~ That was good spotting there, Jeremy.
~ Shut up, you two!!

54:21.240 --> 54:24.550
'Whilst James bumbled
around at the back,

54:24.600 --> 54:27.880
'the other four drivers were
giving us a sensational show.'

54:49.080 --> 54:50.670
Oh, big accident!

54:50.720 --> 54:52.990
But how can he still be going?

55:02.440 --> 55:05.070
'As the others entered their
fourth and final lap,

55:05.120 --> 55:07.190
'James was being caught.'

55:09.200 --> 55:12.080
Gas! And brake!

55:13.320 --> 55:14.710
Turn in.

55:14.760 --> 55:17.630
Hang your arse out, James.
Hang your arse out.

55:17.680 --> 55:20.030
Seagull, James, I've
spotted a seagull.

55:20.080 --> 55:21.390
Shut up!!

55:21.440 --> 55:23.510
Inside line, inside line.

55:26.360 --> 55:29.100
'Amazingly, though,
he got away with it.'

55:30.320 --> 55:31.790
Yes! You haven't been lapped.

55:31.840 --> 55:34.630
Ha, ha! I wasn't lapped!

55:34.680 --> 55:37.790
I'd like to see those other
two Muppets do that!

55:37.840 --> 55:39.390
I hope we weren't distracting to him.

55:39.440 --> 55:42.030
No, I shouldn't think so, he knows
we're there, we're with him.

55:42.080 --> 55:44.670
~ It was reassuring noises.
~ It's like racing in the car with him,

55:44.720 --> 55:47.870
~ it's like we're all three in
the car, all with steering wheels.
~ Exactly.

55:47.920 --> 55:50.870
'As the winner of the heat,
Petter Solberg, celebrated,

55:50.920 --> 55:53.460
'we went to check on James's times.'

55:55.240 --> 55:59.350
~ He was 32 seconds off Petter Solberg's time.
~ Yeah.

55:59.400 --> 56:01.550
Eight seconds a lap slower.

56:01.600 --> 56:05.470
Right. Should we give him a strong
team talk, or should we support him?

56:05.520 --> 56:07.350
He just needs to learn
to drive faster...

56:07.400 --> 56:09.070
~ Faster than the other people.
~ Yeah.

56:09.120 --> 56:11.660
Well, faster than himself would help.

56:13.640 --> 56:16.920
'I was determined to do
better in the next heat.'

56:21.080 --> 56:25.070
'But my spotters were even more
useless than in the first one.'

56:25.120 --> 56:27.070
What time have you got to go tonight?

56:27.120 --> 56:28.990
Uh, well, I just want
to beat the traffic.

56:29.040 --> 56:31.390
Which bit of the M4 do you go down?

56:31.440 --> 56:33.150
Uh, off, at junction 15.

56:33.200 --> 56:34.750
That is near the M5, isn't it?

56:34.800 --> 56:37.310
~ No, no, 17 is Chippenham.
~ It's Bristol.

56:37.360 --> 56:39.400
Shut up, you two!!

56:42.800 --> 56:44.540
Now for the joker.

56:45.840 --> 56:47.670
It's definitely 17, is Chippenham.

56:47.720 --> 56:50.030
I can't believe you don't
know, you do that...

56:50.080 --> 56:53.430
Yeah, but I don't go to 17, I go
to 15, so that's Marlborough...

56:53.480 --> 56:54.470
Shut up!!

56:54.520 --> 56:56.150
~ ..and...
~ Argh!!

56:56.200 --> 56:59.070
'No thanks to my colleagues,
I managed to finish

56:59.120 --> 57:02.590
'another four-lap heat
without being lapped.'

57:02.640 --> 57:05.430
Ho-ho! Come on!

57:05.480 --> 57:06.880
Fantastic.

57:07.840 --> 57:10.350
'But then it was time
for the semifinal,

57:10.400 --> 57:13.140
'and I realised I had
a bigger problem.'

57:14.360 --> 57:16.670
~ The semifinal is six laps.
~ Oh-ho!

57:16.720 --> 57:17.950
So it's half as long again.

57:18.000 --> 57:21.350
And I've worked out, my good laps
- of which I've done maybe two -

57:21.400 --> 57:23.470
were sort of four seconds
off the pace.

57:23.520 --> 57:25.590
But quite a few of my
slightly cocked up ones

57:25.640 --> 57:27.790
were sort of eight
to nine seconds off.

57:27.840 --> 57:29.150
So, in a six-lap race...

57:29.200 --> 57:30.950
~ Six-lap race...
~ Yeah.

57:31.000 --> 57:32.910
.. eight seconds, that's 48 seconds,

57:32.960 --> 57:35.590
and it's a 50... it's
a 50-second lap.

57:35.640 --> 57:38.150
~ Oh, ho-ho! You're in danger!
~ It'll be very, very close.

57:38.200 --> 57:41.070
~ This will be quite close.
~ This is the test.

57:42.280 --> 57:45.510
'With this terrifying maths
playing on my mind,

57:45.560 --> 57:47.990
'I took my place on the grid.'

57:48.040 --> 57:49.550
Do us proud, James, do us proud.

57:49.600 --> 57:51.830
Don't let us down.

57:51.880 --> 57:54.830
Right, here we go,
semifinal, six laps.

57:54.880 --> 57:57.550
So, if you'd like to
place your bets...

58:03.400 --> 58:06.520
'I decided to get my joker
out of the way on lap one...'

58:11.440 --> 58:14.880
'.. which, obviously, my
eagle-eyed spotters noticed.'

58:15.960 --> 58:19.990
James, you were 11 seconds slower
than the lead car on that lap.

58:20.040 --> 58:22.270
But, wait, did he do the joker?

58:22.320 --> 58:24.260
Oh, he might have done.

58:26.160 --> 58:28.910
'Up front, Tanner was
fighting for the lead,

58:28.960 --> 58:31.160
'and the racing was intense.'

58:37.680 --> 58:39.390
'Meanwhile, a bit further back,

58:39.440 --> 58:42.110
'I was managing to
stay out of danger.'

58:44.440 --> 58:47.880
Right, down to second, keep the
power, keep the inside line!

58:51.560 --> 58:54.300
That's not bad, that's
genuinely not bad.

59:00.800 --> 59:03.310
'When James still had two laps to go,

59:03.360 --> 59:06.430
'we realised he was about
to be stabbed in the back

59:06.480 --> 59:08.550
'by his new best friend.'

59:11.720 --> 59:14.110
~ That is Tanner.
~ Is that Tanner on his tail?

59:14.160 --> 59:16.830
James, it's actually
Tanner behind you.

59:20.480 --> 59:22.550
I've got to hold him off!

59:30.120 --> 59:34.200
James, do not let American
Top Gear lap British Top Gear.

59:36.520 --> 59:38.460
I'm getting that wrong!

59:39.120 --> 59:40.520
Come on!

59:43.040 --> 59:44.910
Well, he's right up
behind you, James!

59:44.960 --> 59:46.510
Make your car wide!

59:46.560 --> 59:49.100
Make it as wide as I don't know what.

59:51.440 --> 59:53.310
He's right there. Argh!

59:53.360 --> 59:54.390
Aargh!

59:54.440 --> 59:56.990
On the inside, stay on the
inside, go on the inside!

59:57.040 --> 59:58.440
Inside!

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:04.220
~ Oh!
~ Oh, James he's going to...!

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:13.760
Aargh! Aargh!!

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:18.580
Rubbish.

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:21.910
~ Let's gloat at him there.
~ Studio, yeah.

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:24.230
~ Studio. Back to the studio.
~ Back to the studio,

01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:25.870
~ we'll gloat at him there.
~ Yeah.

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:29.390
Cos I want to get home, frankly,
I don't want to be around...

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:33.510
So, he'll go here, first person
ever to be lapped in Rallycross.

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:36.310
~ Nice, though - name in print.
~ Yeah, exactly.

01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:40.910
Anyway, we have to say,
even with him in it,

01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:42.590
Rallycross is brilliant.

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:44.790
It is fabulous to watch
because, basically,

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:46.910
from the start line
to the finish line,

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:49.190
all the drivers drive
as fast as they can.

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:51.870
Yes, that's it. There's
no conserving their tyres,

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:53.910
there's no looking after
the fuel consumption,

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:55.910
there are no stewards
with moustaches going,

01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:58.110
"Oh, no, you've bumped into him,

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:00.510
"you've got to spend ten seconds
on the naughty step."

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:01.870
I tell you what Formula One is -

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:03.750
Formula One is like having some money

01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:07.190
and putting in an ISA so that
it matures in a tax-free way.

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:10.150
Rallycross is like having some money
and going to the pub with it.

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:13.110
~ Yeah, just blow it on one
big night out, all at once.
~ Exactly.

01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:14.190
Can I just say...?

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:16.230
No, you'll make yourself
look more ridiculous.

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:17.470
You will, he's right.

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:19.430
And, on that bombshell,
it is time to end.

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:21.960
Thank you so much for
watching - good night!
