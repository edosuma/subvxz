00:01.102 --> 00:03.404
**

00:03.504 --> 00:04.772
-(pounding on door)
-What the hell!

00:04.872 --> 00:08.109
-It's only 3:00 p.m.!
-STAN: Family announcement!

00:08.209 --> 00:10.378
(pounding on door)
Family announcement!

00:10.478 --> 00:12.580
Luckily, my stool-softening pill
hasn't kicked in --

00:12.680 --> 00:14.014
(flatulates)
Ohhhhhhh!

00:14.115 --> 00:15.683
-(pounding on door)
-STAN: Family announcement.

00:15.783 --> 00:18.052
Luckily, my orgasm pill
hasn't kicked in --

00:18.152 --> 00:20.121
Aaah!

00:20.221 --> 00:21.889
Welcome to
family announcement.

00:21.989 --> 00:24.125
As you are all aware,
I've been on the wait list

00:24.225 --> 00:27.595
for the Shaquille O'Neal Center
for Intense Sleep Apnea.

00:27.695 --> 00:30.398
They only accept the loudest
three percent of snorers

00:30.498 --> 00:33.434
in the nation,
and I am in!

00:33.534 --> 00:34.868
Top three, baby!

00:34.968 --> 00:36.970
(applause)

00:37.071 --> 00:39.607
Well, they called,
and a spot opened up tonight.

00:39.707 --> 00:40.974
Tonight?

00:41.075 --> 00:42.776
But it's Third Friday
of the month --

00:42.876 --> 00:44.312
our Friday fun night.

00:44.412 --> 00:46.947
Oh, right. Damn.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.716
Hon, just do the study.

00:48.816 --> 00:50.551
-We'll go out next month.
-No, no, no.

00:50.651 --> 00:52.553
It's very important
you get a night out.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.588
-You work so hard.
-I do?

00:54.688 --> 00:55.989
It's an expression.

00:56.090 --> 00:57.658
Hayley, how about taking
your mother out tonight?

00:57.758 --> 00:59.993
Can't. Tonight's the night
we slice all the olives

01:00.094 --> 01:02.230
for the entire
year at Sub Hub.

01:02.330 --> 01:04.132
-But I can lend you Jeff.
-Hmm.

01:04.232 --> 01:05.566
I like that for Francine.

01:05.666 --> 01:06.934
Have him washed, dressed,

01:07.034 --> 01:09.437
and at the base
of the stairs by 7:00.

01:09.537 --> 01:10.938
Family announcement adjourned.

01:11.038 --> 01:13.174
I look forward to
organically crossing paths

01:13.274 --> 01:15.943
with each of you
around the house.

01:16.043 --> 01:18.112
Steve, did you get a chance
to look at the e-mail

01:18.212 --> 01:20.581
I sent you with a link
to all my hilarious, accurate,

01:20.681 --> 01:22.150
and irreverent impressions?

01:22.250 --> 01:24.252
-Yeah, I guess.
-You guess?!

01:24.352 --> 01:26.154
I sent it to you
like 15 times.

01:26.254 --> 01:27.421
Which e-mail address?

01:27.521 --> 01:29.823
SteveSmith69@gmail.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.693
Oh, that one got hacked.

01:32.793 --> 01:35.263
Uh, send it to
SteveSmith420.

01:35.363 --> 01:36.597
What?!

01:36.697 --> 01:39.267
You were able to get
420 and 69?

01:39.367 --> 01:43.437
Man, every other Steve Smith
must be a loser!

01:43.537 --> 01:45.939
(patriotic music plays)

01:46.039 --> 01:48.609
* Good morning, U.S.A. *

01:48.709 --> 01:52.480
* I got a feelin' that
it's gonna be a wonderful day *

01:52.580 --> 01:55.683
* The sun in the sky
has a smile on his face *

01:55.783 --> 01:59.987
* And he's shinin' a salute
to the American race *

02:01.889 --> 02:05.159
* Oh, boy, it's swell to say *

02:05.259 --> 02:07.461
-* Good -- *
-* Good morning, U.S.A. *

02:07.561 --> 02:08.796
Aah!

02:10.063 --> 02:13.401
* Good morning, U.S.A. *

02:13.501 --> 02:15.903
**

02:16.003 --> 02:18.539
Jeff, I want to thank you
for Hayley making you do this.

02:18.639 --> 02:19.540
You're welcome?

02:19.640 --> 02:21.041
No. You're welcome.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.076
Right.

02:23.177 --> 02:24.878
Before Francine and I
were married,

02:24.978 --> 02:26.580
she was
a pretty wild woman.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.148
She's mellowed
over the years,

02:28.249 --> 02:30.050
but she's still
wild at heart,

02:30.150 --> 02:32.152
and there's always the risk
she can relapse.

02:32.253 --> 02:33.521
-With me so far?
-No.

02:33.621 --> 02:34.855
Hmm.

02:34.955 --> 02:38.492
Better join me
in my metaphor corner.

02:38.592 --> 02:39.827
Look at that bird

02:39.927 --> 02:42.263
flapping, tweeting,
darting around.

02:42.363 --> 02:43.664
It's happy because
it thinks

02:43.764 --> 02:45.933
it's positively
going wild.

02:46.033 --> 02:48.001
But what would happen
if I open a window

02:48.101 --> 02:49.870
and really
let it go wild?

02:49.970 --> 02:52.005
(gasps) It would
fly right into the sun!

02:52.105 --> 02:53.741
Yes. Yes, it would.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.843
Uh, I'm the bird.

02:55.943 --> 02:57.378
-No.
-I'm the cage?

02:57.478 --> 02:58.546
No. You're --
You're not really

02:58.646 --> 02:59.847
represented in
this metaphor.

02:59.947 --> 03:02.015
Oh. Do you still
need me tomorrow?

03:02.115 --> 03:03.551
It's tonight, Jeff.

03:03.651 --> 03:06.220
Tonight, we let Francine
out of her cage,

03:06.320 --> 03:08.289
and you're going to
be there to prevent her

03:08.389 --> 03:10.190
from flying into the sun.

03:10.291 --> 03:12.593
So I am the cage.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.362
You're not in the metaphor!

03:14.462 --> 03:17.365
Take what time you need,
then meet me back at my desk.

03:23.437 --> 03:25.473
Ah. You made it.
Over the years,

03:25.573 --> 03:27.541
I've calculated the precise
amount of stimulus

03:27.641 --> 03:30.711
Francine needs to feel like
she's going wild

03:30.811 --> 03:32.246
without
really going wild.

03:32.346 --> 03:33.914
Like the bird.

03:34.014 --> 03:36.149
That's right.
The 75 minutes you spent

03:36.250 --> 03:37.818
in the corner
served you well.

03:37.918 --> 03:39.920
Now, pay close attention
because you're about to get

03:40.020 --> 03:42.590
a crash course
in Francine Control.

03:42.690 --> 03:44.992
No cinnamon.
Its aroma is too primal.

03:45.092 --> 03:47.160
Do not let her
put on flat shoes.

03:47.261 --> 03:49.763
She ran track in high school,
and you'll never catch her.

03:49.863 --> 03:51.432
Do not let her get wind
in her hair.

03:51.532 --> 03:53.334
It conjures
strange passions.

03:53.434 --> 03:56.470
None of those clown scarves
you can keep pulling on forever.

03:56.570 --> 03:59.072
No Israeli couscous,
and I mean zero.

03:59.172 --> 04:01.442
And finally,
if all else fails,

04:01.542 --> 04:04.244
remind her another episode
of Tom Selleck's Blue Bloods

04:04.345 --> 04:05.979
starts at 10:00 on CBS.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.081
She falls for
the bait of sexy Magnum

04:08.181 --> 04:09.317
and ends up
dozing off in bed

04:09.417 --> 04:11.285
to a series
of family dinner scenes.

04:11.385 --> 04:13.153
This is too much
to remember!

04:13.253 --> 04:14.922
You've been talking
for hours!

04:15.022 --> 04:17.825
Don't worry, I put
everything on the card.

04:19.627 --> 04:22.763
You can count on me, Mr. S.

04:22.863 --> 04:25.666
And one more thing,
it's probably best Francine

04:25.766 --> 04:27.167
doesn't see the card.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.802
But I can see it, right?

04:28.902 --> 04:30.203
(sighs) Yes, Jeff.

04:30.304 --> 04:32.373
That's the cornerstone
of our plan.

04:34.975 --> 04:37.277
**

04:37.378 --> 04:39.947
We'll start with
two tap waters.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.482
And a white wine
spritzer.

04:41.582 --> 04:44.017
Wine and bubbles...

04:44.117 --> 04:45.886
that could be wild.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.187
Excuse me!

04:47.287 --> 04:48.889
How's the lighting
under the table?

04:48.989 --> 04:51.224
The best
in all of Langley.

04:53.293 --> 04:56.196
You can bring
the spritzer!

04:56.296 --> 04:58.799
What are you doing
down there?

04:58.899 --> 05:00.468
Playing cat's cradle.

05:00.568 --> 05:02.903
I was looking up your
dress, Mrs. S.

05:03.003 --> 05:04.738
Oh!

05:04.838 --> 05:06.640
Ready to order?
Can I suggest you start

05:06.740 --> 05:08.509
with our new
Tableside Guacamole?

05:08.609 --> 05:12.245
(gasps)
Tableside, oh my!

05:12.346 --> 05:15.816
I read in Sky Ways Magazine
that Kiefer Sutherland

05:15.916 --> 05:20.754
has tableside guac every time
he's in San Antonio.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.089
Guacamole...

05:22.189 --> 05:23.891
guacamole...

05:26.760 --> 05:29.497
Sorry, Your Honor,
but guacamole's forbidden.

05:29.597 --> 05:30.664
Oh, let's have some.

05:30.764 --> 05:31.865
Let's live
a little, Jeff.

05:31.965 --> 05:32.866
(snaps)

05:32.966 --> 05:34.034
(horn honks)

05:34.134 --> 05:36.704
* Tableside, tableside *

05:36.804 --> 05:39.840
* So much hotter
when it's tableside *

05:44.011 --> 05:45.513
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, God.

05:45.613 --> 05:47.781
I-I don't know
if we have time for this.

05:47.881 --> 05:50.250
Blue Bloods starts
at 10:00, you know?

05:50.350 --> 05:53.621
Hmm.
I guess we'll pass.

05:53.721 --> 05:57.090
I heard in tonight's episode,
the DEA comes down hard

05:57.190 --> 05:59.359
on the family,
and Tom Selleck

05:59.460 --> 06:02.195
has a booger
in his mustache

06:02.295 --> 06:07.100
that no one tells him
about for the entire day.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.603
**

06:09.703 --> 06:11.572
Okay, Steve.

06:11.672 --> 06:13.373
Got the house to yourself.

06:13.474 --> 06:17.044
Time for some risky business.

06:17.144 --> 06:20.414
Now all I need is some
royalty-free tunes.

06:20.514 --> 06:24.284
Alexa, play Bob Sargar's
"New Town Rock N' Loll."

06:24.384 --> 06:28.155
-(rock music plays)
-Aaah!

06:44.304 --> 06:47.841
**

06:47.941 --> 06:50.277
Klaus?
What happened?

06:50.377 --> 06:51.812
Pretty nasty fall.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.582
But don't worry,
I'll take care of you.

06:54.682 --> 06:56.650
I don't get it,
our living room floor

06:56.750 --> 06:58.586
has never been
that slippery.

06:58.686 --> 07:00.153
Slippy Oil?

07:00.253 --> 07:02.355
Oh, you just had

07:02.456 --> 07:05.859
to look over
at the Slippy Oil, Steve.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.194
(grunts)

07:07.294 --> 07:10.831
Oh, you're not
going anywhere.

07:10.931 --> 07:14.201
Oh, you should have read
my e-mails, Steve.

07:14.301 --> 07:15.536
Y-You're saying "Oh"

07:15.636 --> 07:17.270
in front of everything
you say, Klaus.

07:17.370 --> 07:19.607
Oh, am I?

07:19.707 --> 07:22.109
**

07:22.209 --> 07:24.144
Mmm!
That was good.

07:24.244 --> 07:29.216
So brown, so broiled,
with such a mild mustard.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.352
I'm sorry, sir,
this isn't a credit card.

07:32.452 --> 07:36.156
This is a note card
with impossibly tiny writing.

07:36.256 --> 07:38.859
"Francine Date Night
Dos and Don'ts"?

07:38.959 --> 07:41.562
"No pickles
over three inches"?

07:41.662 --> 07:44.331
"Only allowed to
move pawns in chess"?

07:44.431 --> 07:47.134
"No Cocoa Puffs
or any other cereals

07:47.234 --> 07:49.570
that drive
their mascots insane"?

07:49.670 --> 07:51.004
It's not what
it looks like!

07:51.104 --> 07:53.807
Mr. S just wants
to keep you from going wild.

07:53.907 --> 07:56.977
* Wild women do *

07:57.077 --> 07:58.912
Ooooooh.

07:59.012 --> 08:02.683
I haven't gone wild
in a long time.

08:02.783 --> 08:06.419
* And they don't regret it *

08:06.520 --> 08:07.721
Guess what, Jeff.

08:07.821 --> 08:10.591
This Friday Fun Night
is about to go wild,

08:10.691 --> 08:13.561
and Stan can't stop me,
and neither can you.

08:15.663 --> 08:17.164
Flat shoes!

08:17.264 --> 08:19.232
Wait for me, Mrs. S!

08:19.332 --> 08:21.034
I can't let you go wild!

08:21.134 --> 08:25.038
Five orders
of Tableside Guac!

08:25.138 --> 08:26.774
Mrs. S!

08:26.874 --> 08:29.342
Couldn't order six, huh?
It's all right.

08:29.442 --> 08:32.245
I'll stay here and (bleep)
myself, why don't I?

08:36.917 --> 08:38.752
I'm going wild!

08:38.852 --> 08:40.721
Truck jump.

08:40.821 --> 08:42.856
Whoa! Cool!

08:46.794 --> 08:48.629
Oh, sick!

08:51.098 --> 08:52.265
Aah!

08:53.533 --> 08:54.968
No way!

08:55.068 --> 08:56.069
-(thud)
-Aaah!

08:56.169 --> 09:00.107
Stop!
For God's sake, stop!

09:00.207 --> 09:02.475
Oh!
What's gonna happen?

09:02.576 --> 09:03.944
(screams)

09:04.044 --> 09:06.313
Tasty!

09:06.413 --> 09:09.082
Mrs. S, please
don't go wild.

09:09.182 --> 09:10.751
What if I just go
"hi-yuh"?

09:10.851 --> 09:12.119
-What?
-Hi-ya!

09:12.219 --> 09:15.222
Aw, man.
Party's over.

09:17.290 --> 09:19.459
Oh, yeah!
Back on.

09:20.728 --> 09:23.096
**

09:23.196 --> 09:25.565
You think it's okay
to ignore my e-mails?

09:25.666 --> 09:29.770
Well, now you're gonna watch
all my impressions.

09:29.870 --> 09:33.173
Here's Martha Stewart
encountering a demon...

09:33.273 --> 09:34.775
"Mmm, mmm, mmm.

09:34.875 --> 09:38.278
Time to cook the recipe
and put the thing in the oven."

09:38.378 --> 09:39.747
Aaah!

09:39.847 --> 09:42.115
-Oh, God!
-This the lady

09:42.215 --> 09:44.284
who used to work at
the Chimdale Jack in the Box

09:44.384 --> 09:47.855
visiting her former co-workers
for the first time.

09:47.955 --> 09:49.923
"I'm baaaaack!"

09:50.023 --> 09:52.025
Somebody kill me!

09:52.125 --> 09:54.527
(upbeat country music plays)

09:54.628 --> 09:56.429
Another round!

09:56.529 --> 09:57.865
-Whoooo!
-Francine!

09:57.965 --> 09:58.866
Yeah!

09:58.966 --> 10:00.200
Whoa!

10:00.300 --> 10:01.869
Yeah, bar fight!

10:01.969 --> 10:02.870
Ugh!

10:02.970 --> 10:04.604
Wait.
Is this a fight?

10:04.705 --> 10:06.974
Nah, he was thrown off
our mechanical bull.

10:07.074 --> 10:09.843
That's the most dangerous
bull in the country,

10:09.943 --> 10:12.279
aside from bull shit.

10:12.379 --> 10:15.683
Misinformation is the real
national crisis.

10:15.783 --> 10:17.017
Y'all want
some popcorn?

10:17.117 --> 10:19.687
(smooches)
Here, Mrs. S!

10:19.787 --> 10:22.189
F.S.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.391
Francine Smith!

10:24.491 --> 10:26.794
Coyote Ugly!
Coyote Ugly!

10:26.894 --> 10:28.028
Whoooooo!

10:31.531 --> 10:33.366
Let me kick your beer!

10:33.466 --> 10:35.135
Mrs. S,
what are you doing?

10:35.235 --> 10:36.737
Gotcha!

10:36.837 --> 10:38.972
BARTENDER:
And stay out!

10:39.072 --> 10:41.508
Ooooooh.
Fun alley.

10:41.608 --> 10:44.044
Let's get murdered
by Batman's parents.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.679
Can we just
go home now?

10:45.779 --> 10:48.581
Come on, Jeff.
You don't want to do that.

10:48.682 --> 10:52.419
You know that deep down
inside, you're like me --

10:52.519 --> 10:54.054
a wild woman!

10:54.154 --> 10:56.323
I'm -- I'm a man.

10:56.423 --> 10:58.658
And how wild is that?!

10:58.759 --> 11:02.763
Now, close your eyes, Jeff,
and listen to your heart.

11:02.863 --> 11:06.700
* Wild women do *

11:06.800 --> 11:08.235
(gasps) I heard it!

11:08.335 --> 11:09.703
Shh.
It's not done.

11:09.803 --> 11:12.572
* And they don't regret it *

11:12.672 --> 11:14.041
There's no downside!

11:14.141 --> 11:15.575
That's right.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.178
Now, let's show them we can go
as wild as we want!

11:18.278 --> 11:19.612
Yeah!

11:19.713 --> 11:21.581
Let's do a series of quick,
little things,

11:21.681 --> 11:23.616
each more wild
than the last.

11:23.717 --> 11:28.088
* Wild women do,
and they don't regret it *

11:28.188 --> 11:30.724
**

11:30.824 --> 11:37.097
* Wild women show
what they're goin' through *

11:37.197 --> 11:38.966
* Oooh, ooh *

11:39.066 --> 11:44.772
* Wild women do what you think
they'll never *

11:44.872 --> 11:46.373
(Francine whistles)

11:46.473 --> 11:52.079
* What you only dream
about wild women do *

11:52.179 --> 11:54.547
* Ohhhhh, yes *

11:54.647 --> 11:57.084
* Listen to me, Jack,
I ain't holdin' back *

11:57.184 --> 11:58.618
(snoring loudly)

11:58.718 --> 12:01.054
* 'Cause wild women do *

12:01.154 --> 12:02.389
* And they don't regret it *

12:02.489 --> 12:05.826
Hey, I know
what might be fun.

12:05.926 --> 12:08.896
Let's take something
from a person.

12:08.996 --> 12:12.966
Let's show a human being
the true meaning of fear.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.268
-Stick 'em up!
-This is a bank robbery!

12:15.368 --> 12:16.303
(screams)

12:16.403 --> 12:18.338
Delmonaco?

12:18.438 --> 12:20.107
Francine!

12:20.207 --> 12:21.809
And who's
this piece of ass?

12:21.909 --> 12:24.244
This is Jeff,
my son-in-law.

12:24.344 --> 12:28.348
Jeff, Delmonaco,
my dealer of drugs.

12:29.349 --> 12:32.252
Mwah.
Enchanté.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.521
This is too crazy.

12:34.621 --> 12:36.023
I'm actually gonna
go hang out

12:36.123 --> 12:37.690
one-on-one
with my dry cleaner.

12:37.791 --> 12:39.092
You guys should come!

12:39.192 --> 12:41.328
Just you
and your dry cleaner?

12:41.428 --> 12:43.997
That sounds crazy!
We're doing it!

12:46.599 --> 12:49.502
Now, you should know,
Mr. Rick is a dry cleaner,

12:49.602 --> 12:52.973
so he hates
washing machines.

12:53.073 --> 12:55.375
Mr. Rick, it's me,
Delmonaco.

12:55.475 --> 12:57.477
MR. RICK: Bullshit!
You're a washing machine!

12:57.577 --> 13:00.981
Washing machines don't knock
on doors, Mr. Rick.

13:01.081 --> 13:03.616
Sounds like what
a washing machine would say!

13:05.718 --> 13:07.020
(whispering)
Come into my house

13:07.120 --> 13:08.221
really fast,
really fast.

13:08.321 --> 13:09.857
This guy's got
a great energy.

13:12.559 --> 13:14.661
Welcome to paradise.

13:14.761 --> 13:16.563
Let me outline
your night for you.

13:16.663 --> 13:18.999
We sit around, we huff
dry-cleaning chemicals,

13:19.099 --> 13:20.834
we have a scintillating
conversation.

13:20.934 --> 13:22.035
I have only one rule --

13:22.135 --> 13:23.803
I feel silly
even mentioning it --

13:23.904 --> 13:26.673
nobody's allowed to turn
into a washing machine.

13:26.773 --> 13:28.909
It happens.
And if it does,

13:29.009 --> 13:31.211
I will take
care of business!

13:31.311 --> 13:34.314
Second rule -- so the
conversation remains orderly,

13:34.414 --> 13:36.850
you speak when I have
the knife to your throat.

13:36.950 --> 13:38.518
You have the floor,
m'lady.

13:38.618 --> 13:41.855
Mr. Rick,
I need to use the restroom.

13:41.955 --> 13:44.024
So does Jeff.

13:44.124 --> 13:47.594
It's the first door past
the old Hollywood Video sign.

13:47.694 --> 13:49.930
This guy is giving
me bad vibes.

13:50.030 --> 13:52.532
-In what way?
-He's insane!

13:52.632 --> 13:56.203
The toilet's right here,
and the toilet-scrubbing brush

13:56.303 --> 13:58.571
is all the way
over there!

13:58.671 --> 14:00.340
We proved
we could get wild,

14:00.440 --> 14:02.342
but I think we should
go home now.

14:02.442 --> 14:04.945
This is my first time
getting wild.

14:05.045 --> 14:06.947
I'm not going
back to my cage.

14:07.047 --> 14:08.949
I'm flying
straight to the sun.

14:09.049 --> 14:10.417
MR. RICK:
How are you guys doing?!

14:10.517 --> 14:12.085
If you spilled on yourselves,
don't worry,

14:12.185 --> 14:14.054
I have two bedrooms
full of women's clothes.

14:14.154 --> 14:16.623
I am particularly proud
of my sundress collection!

14:16.723 --> 14:19.526
But not so proud I couldn't
see myself giving you one

14:19.626 --> 14:21.394
if I thought
it looked good on you.

14:21.494 --> 14:23.030
Jeff, I think we should
get out of here.

14:23.130 --> 14:24.131
(light switch clicks)

14:24.231 --> 14:26.033
(both scream)

14:26.133 --> 14:28.235
Bathroom time
is over.

14:30.570 --> 14:31.738
It's game time!

14:31.838 --> 14:32.872
-(gun cocks)
-Wha --

14:32.973 --> 14:34.407
What game
are we playing?

14:34.507 --> 14:36.944
It's Hot Potato
with a loaded gun.

14:37.044 --> 14:39.812
My dear friend Tom Sizemore
taught me this game.

14:39.913 --> 14:41.481
(Muzak plays)

14:41.581 --> 14:44.284
But first,
Tetrachloroethylene?

14:44.384 --> 14:45.885
Tetrachloroethylene?

14:45.986 --> 14:46.954
No?

14:47.054 --> 14:49.056
(sniffing)

14:49.156 --> 14:52.325
Ooooh!
Wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow, whoa!

14:52.425 --> 14:54.227
**

14:54.327 --> 14:55.795
Whoa! It's hot!
(laughs)

14:55.895 --> 14:57.797
-Aah!
-Aah!

14:57.897 --> 14:59.632
(laughs)

14:59.732 --> 15:02.402
They're afraid of
a little gun, Delmonaco!

15:02.502 --> 15:03.971
Psych! Psych! Pysch!

15:06.439 --> 15:08.308
You guys hear that?

15:08.408 --> 15:09.609
Someone's at the door.

15:09.709 --> 15:11.344
Could be a washing machine.

15:12.845 --> 15:14.747
(both scream)

15:14.847 --> 15:18.751
My dry cleaner
is dead!

15:18.851 --> 15:22.089
I am so sorry,
Deltaco.

15:27.327 --> 15:29.997
Why must God
take the perfect ones?!

15:30.097 --> 15:33.166
Now I have to tell his
13-year-old girlfriend!

15:33.266 --> 15:35.868
We're going to call the cops
right now and explain.

15:35.969 --> 15:38.438
But our fingerprints
are all over that gun.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.440
My God!
What are we gonna do?!

15:40.540 --> 15:44.011
I'll call my fixer.
He'll get us out of this.

15:44.111 --> 15:45.545
Listen carefully
to my instructions,

15:45.645 --> 15:47.014
we'll cover up this murder

15:47.114 --> 15:48.815
and all go back
to our beautiful evenings.

15:48.915 --> 15:50.783
I need you to make some
hot jasmine tea.

15:50.883 --> 15:52.119
Very weak.

15:52.219 --> 15:53.786
I have a very strong
intolerance to jasmine.

15:53.886 --> 15:55.855
It's like poison to me --
total organ failure.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.790
But the flavor --
get out of town!

15:57.890 --> 16:00.360
It's like I'm drinking
a warm summer night.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.462
Are you gonna
get him the tea?

16:02.562 --> 16:04.064
Sounds like he shouldn't
have it.

16:04.164 --> 16:06.066
Okay, first,
this body needs

16:06.166 --> 16:08.201
to disappear
without a trace.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.837
Oh, it's so bloody!

16:10.937 --> 16:12.672
God, it's all over.

16:12.772 --> 16:14.141
Ugh!

16:17.144 --> 16:18.645
Okay,
this is a problem.

16:18.745 --> 16:21.381
I saw an episode of CSI
where the cops found blood,

16:21.481 --> 16:23.083
and they used it
to solve the crime.

16:23.183 --> 16:25.318
This blood has to disappear
without a trace.

16:25.418 --> 16:27.487
I'll Google how.
Phone.

16:27.587 --> 16:30.090
I do swipe text.
Watch how fast.

16:30.190 --> 16:31.924
Kind of tricky with this blood
all over my hands,

16:32.025 --> 16:33.360
but -- oh, here we go.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.195
WOMAN: 911.
What's your emergency?

16:35.295 --> 16:36.329
(all gasp)

16:36.429 --> 16:38.365
Murder.

16:38.465 --> 16:39.366
(all gasp)

16:39.466 --> 16:41.901
There was a murder.

16:42.001 --> 16:44.037
But don't you worry,
it's being handled by me

16:44.137 --> 16:45.538
and the other killers.

16:46.873 --> 16:49.176
A patrol car's been
dispatched to your location.

16:49.276 --> 16:50.610
Well, not everything
worked out

16:50.710 --> 16:51.944
the way
we thought it would.

16:52.045 --> 16:53.780
But I declare
this situation...

16:55.715 --> 16:58.085
...fixed!

16:58.185 --> 17:01.020
I got to find
a new dry cleaner.

17:02.422 --> 17:04.291
Fixer, murder!
Fixer, murder!

17:04.391 --> 17:06.226
Fixer, murder!
Fixer, murder!

17:06.326 --> 17:07.394
Fixer, murder!

17:09.762 --> 17:11.431
Okay, this is
John Cusack

17:11.531 --> 17:13.900
being yelled at
by an Uber driver.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.568
"Get out, John Cusack!

17:15.668 --> 17:19.106
You can't tell me I can't
smoke in my own car!"

17:19.206 --> 17:22.709
I don't understand.
Why didn't you do John Cusack?

17:22.809 --> 17:25.412
I can't do Cusack.
He's impossible!

17:25.512 --> 17:27.280
Caliendo can't even
do Cusack!

17:27.380 --> 17:29.282
This is my impression
of a domestic dispute

17:29.382 --> 17:31.651
I overheard
at the mall last winter.

17:31.751 --> 17:33.953
"It's a bigger issue
than the fries, Jeanine.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.556
You don't respect me!"

17:36.656 --> 17:39.159
(chuckles)

17:40.393 --> 17:43.130
Oh, my God.
I get it now.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.132
-It's good.
-Yes.

17:45.232 --> 17:46.599
You're a genius.

17:46.699 --> 17:48.168
All it took was being
held captive

17:48.268 --> 17:50.069
for six hours
to realize it.

17:50.170 --> 17:52.439
Yeah, I'm a bit
of an acquired taste.

17:52.539 --> 17:55.175
(laughs)

17:56.309 --> 17:59.512
Okay, I know I'm good,
but you're giving me

17:59.612 --> 18:01.948
a Horatio Sanz-level
reception here.

18:02.048 --> 18:04.284
Give me more.
More!

18:04.384 --> 18:07.019
You know, I totally forgot
today's the day

18:07.120 --> 18:09.989
I was supposed to help
Jurgen hunt Slender Man.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.492
And I've already pushed
the hunt like five times,

18:12.592 --> 18:14.194
so I'll just release you
from your bonds,

18:14.294 --> 18:16.296
and we can both go
our separate ways.

18:18.331 --> 18:22.001
I may be free to go,
but I'm a slave to laughter.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.837
Now do Al Pacino forgetting
the combination

18:24.937 --> 18:26.206
to his gym locker!

18:26.306 --> 18:28.208
Somebody help me!

18:28.308 --> 18:30.510
That's exactly
what'd he say!

18:30.610 --> 18:31.778
(laughs)

18:31.878 --> 18:33.280
(siren wails in distance)

18:33.380 --> 18:35.148
Dang it.
The cops are here,

18:35.248 --> 18:37.116
and the Uber's still
three minutes out.

18:37.217 --> 18:39.719
I'd cancel it, but that's
my rating on the line.

18:39.819 --> 18:41.621
(sobs)
We're going to jail

18:41.721 --> 18:42.889
for murder.

18:42.989 --> 18:44.657
Stan was right.

18:44.757 --> 18:45.858
We're too wild

18:45.958 --> 18:47.360
to be trusted
with ourselves.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.795
Hold on, Mrs. S.

18:48.895 --> 18:51.398
Maybe alone we can't
take care of ourselves,

18:51.498 --> 18:52.732
but there's two of us.

18:52.832 --> 18:54.667
We got to be able
to help each other.

18:54.767 --> 18:56.369
How?

18:56.469 --> 18:59.406
* Wild women do *

18:59.506 --> 19:02.041
By going wild.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.212
Dresses.

19:05.312 --> 19:07.046
(siren wails, tires squeal)

19:09.081 --> 19:10.883
Am I crazy,

19:10.983 --> 19:14.521
or are all those paint samples
the same red?

19:14.621 --> 19:18.258
* Wild women do,
and they don't regret it *

19:18.358 --> 19:20.993
Hey, boys.

19:21.093 --> 19:23.563
Whooo-hoooooo!

19:23.663 --> 19:26.165
Dispatch,
I'd like to report

19:26.266 --> 19:29.836
three beautiful ladies
in sundresses.

19:29.936 --> 19:32.004
All we got here
is a 3-1-3.

19:32.104 --> 19:34.607
DISPATCHER: Women going wild
and doing what they do?

19:34.707 --> 19:37.009
Yeah,
I said 3-1-3.

19:37.109 --> 19:38.411
Why do we even
have these codes

19:38.511 --> 19:39.846
if you insist
on explaining them?

19:39.946 --> 19:41.080
Well, I'll tell you why.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.015
Because I'm training someone.

19:43.115 --> 19:44.251
Oh, gosh.
I'm sorry.

19:44.351 --> 19:46.853
Wait a minute.

19:46.953 --> 19:49.188
Put the trainee on.

19:49.289 --> 19:52.191
(groans)

19:52.292 --> 19:54.294
All right,
there's no trainee.

19:54.394 --> 19:55.962
You never
miss a beat.

19:56.062 --> 19:58.064
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-
da-da-da-da!

19:58.164 --> 19:59.432
Pah!

19:59.532 --> 20:03.570
I declare this whole
night -- no crimes!

20:03.670 --> 20:07.039
Now we need to figure out
what to do with Mr. Rick.

20:07.139 --> 20:09.909
What if he
died again...

20:10.009 --> 20:11.778
for the first time?

20:11.878 --> 20:13.746
(engine revs, tires squeal)

20:13.846 --> 20:18.751
(country music plays)

20:18.851 --> 20:22.255
This previously alive woman
was just killed!

20:22.355 --> 20:23.656
Another one?

20:23.756 --> 20:25.392
Throw her
in the pile in back.

20:25.492 --> 20:27.727
Okay, who ordered
mozzarella sticks?

20:27.827 --> 20:29.729
I have not been
writing things down.

20:29.829 --> 20:32.632
I hate when they don't
write things down.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.737
-I had a lot of fun tonight.
-So did I.

20:37.837 --> 20:40.840
I was thinking, since
we got away with this,

20:40.940 --> 20:43.443
we could make
a thing of it.

20:43.543 --> 20:46.112
Go wild together
once a month?

20:46.212 --> 20:47.514
Pbht! Pass.

20:47.614 --> 20:48.681
Pbht! Pbht!

20:49.949 --> 20:51.851
Just kidding.
We're best friends now.

20:51.951 --> 20:55.422
* Wild women whoooo! *

20:55.522 --> 20:56.823
* Woman *

20:58.257 --> 21:01.328
American Dad! time is over.

21:02.194 --> 21:04.130
Bye-bye.
See you soon.

21:06.198 --> 21:08.000
