WEBVTT

00:00.092 --> 00:02.136
Karen Proctor and her mob
killed Harry.

00:02.156 --> 00:04.783
They planted
the wood-splitter at my place.

00:04.866 --> 00:06.181
Did you tell the cops?
Well, no.

00:06.248 --> 00:08.835
Well, what about the splitter?
I destroyed it.

00:08.960 --> 00:13.088
All it'll take is one little jab
with an infected needle

00:13.355 --> 00:16.108
and you and the rug rat can join our
club.

00:16.233 --> 00:19.277
If I got jabbed by a needle that
had Hep C, could the baby catch it?

00:19.402 --> 00:22.905
Did somebody threaten you,
Anderson? Was it Lucy Gambaro?

00:23.032 --> 00:26.367
My Hep C status. I'll mention
it at the next staff meeting.

00:26.492 --> 00:30.038
Is that wise? If you have
aspirations for a governorship,

00:30.163 --> 00:34.126
they won't give it to you if
they know about your condition.

00:34.251 --> 00:37.420
Are you OK? Hey, Jess, I've
got a plumbing job for you.

00:37.504 --> 00:39.465
Hey, Franky, don't flush.

00:41.633 --> 00:47.348
I hit him.
A man, on the bike. He's dead.

00:47.368 --> 00:48.724
The victim's wife
wants to meet with you.

00:48.807 --> 00:49.913
Do I have to do it?

00:49.932 --> 00:52.644
If you really are sorry, then
telling her face to face,

00:52.821 --> 00:54.030
it'll give her closure.

00:54.155 --> 00:57.826
What the hell!
You killed my wife!

00:57.909 --> 01:00.287
Just do it! I don't deserve it!

01:08.837 --> 01:11.088
So, you ready to take on Ferguson,
then?

01:11.213 --> 01:13.258
I hope you've got a bigger
army than me.

01:59.161 --> 02:02.539
She had you run down
like a dog in the street.

02:04.535 --> 02:07.111
She had her thug mess with me.

02:07.231 --> 02:12.177
Tortured Jodie Spiteri.
You know, she killed Simmo Slater?

02:12.296 --> 02:15.473
Yeah, she was the one
who gave her the hotshot.

02:15.554 --> 02:17.163
She's a monster.

02:20.059 --> 02:23.799
But even monsters have
a weak spot, Mr Fletcher.

02:23.879 --> 02:26.372
Where's Ferguson's weak spot?

02:27.499 --> 02:29.148
Where most people's are...

02:29.228 --> 02:32.606
..in the past.

02:32.727 --> 02:36.226
Blackmoore Prison, 2000.
What's at Blackmoore?

02:36.306 --> 02:38.559
Not what. Who.

02:38.679 --> 02:40.650
Ferguson was in love with an
inmate there.

02:40.669 --> 02:42.037
It's possible they had a
relationship.

02:42.127 --> 02:43.174
That's your plan?

02:43.294 --> 02:45.707
Expose the Governor
for screwing a prisoner?

02:45.827 --> 02:48.241
Oh, no, no. I'm not interested in
embarrassing her.

02:48.361 --> 02:52.304
I want to take that bitch
apart a piece at a time.

02:52.425 --> 02:55.922
But to do that, we're
going to have to work together.

02:56.003 --> 02:57.129
What do you want me to do?

02:57.813 --> 03:00.105
I need you to find out who that
prisoner is.

03:00.226 --> 03:03.202
I don't have a last name - only a
first.

03:03.282 --> 03:05.133
Her name is Jianna.

03:08.631 --> 03:09.959
And when I find her?

03:53.031 --> 03:55.807
Who were the senior officers
on duty last night?

04:12.858 --> 04:14.428
Welcome back.

04:16.759 --> 04:18.529
Take Spiteri to the Psych Unit.
Come on.

04:28.544 --> 04:31.198
Thought you worked the graveyard.

04:31.319 --> 04:34.415
Doubling up. The staff
cutbacks are starting to bite.

04:34.535 --> 04:38.277
Tell me about it.
Over-worked, under-paid...

04:38.397 --> 04:41.494
Watch the fuckin' ankle!
Under-appreciated.

04:41.574 --> 04:44.028
Couldn't get someone else to cover?

04:44.109 --> 04:45.716
I don't mind the extra shift.

04:45.797 --> 04:48.451
This one's come at a good time.

04:50.543 --> 04:52.795
Oh!

04:57.419 --> 04:59.431
Now, remove your pants.

04:59.551 --> 05:04.176
I got a steel plate in my
ankle and 16 bloody screws.

05:04.296 --> 05:06.187
The prisoner doesn't
need assistance.

05:18.372 --> 05:20.705
Ms Miles?

05:20.786 --> 05:22.234
Step outside.

05:37.154 --> 05:41.941
During the riot, threatening me
with a syringe full of blood.

05:42.022 --> 05:43.429
That was your idea, wasn't it?

05:50.346 --> 05:53.000
Wasn't it, Gambaro?

06:03.015 --> 06:04.865
Have it your way.

06:09.651 --> 06:12.224
Go for your life.

06:12.304 --> 06:14.918
Long as you finish what you start.

06:14.999 --> 06:16.448
I intend to.

06:19.061 --> 06:20.952
Governor, I was told
you wanted to see me.

06:21.033 --> 06:24.490
Yes, Mr Fletcher.

06:24.611 --> 06:27.226
Sit down.
I prefer to stand.

06:27.346 --> 06:31.167
Since the accident, I find I tend
to cramp up if I sit for too long.

06:31.287 --> 06:33.500
Well, I am so sorry
to hear about that.

06:33.621 --> 06:35.751
Still, you have
recovered remarkably well.

06:35.832 --> 06:38.285
I have a lot to be grateful for.

06:38.406 --> 06:40.416
Your support, for
one thing, Governor.

06:40.538 --> 06:42.508
Mr Fletcher, please. Let's
dispense with the false platitudes.

06:42.629 --> 06:45.605
I think we both
know why you are here.

06:45.725 --> 06:48.542
I have always suspected that
your brain injury wasn't as

06:48.621 --> 06:50.431
debilitating as you made out.

06:50.551 --> 06:53.890
Uh, I... I'm not...
I mean, I don't...

06:53.971 --> 06:55.699
Bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh. Just stop!

06:55.820 --> 07:00.526
Just stop it with the... with
the inarticulation and the slack jaw

07:00.646 --> 07:04.386
and the Neanderthal gait and the...
I mean, did you really think that

07:04.507 --> 07:06.800
you could unsettle me by
dredging up the past, did you?

07:06.881 --> 07:08.568
I mean, is this the best you can do?

07:08.689 --> 07:11.264
Governor, I... I don't...
You don't what, Mr Fletcher?

07:11.385 --> 07:14.039
I...I don't understand
why you're talking to me like this.

07:14.120 --> 07:15.567
Don't you?

07:22.565 --> 07:24.736
Do you know who this is?

07:26.344 --> 07:29.282
No!

07:29.402 --> 07:31.774
Governor, have I...
have I done something wrong?

07:34.066 --> 07:35.837
Well, I don't know, Mr Fletcher.

07:35.918 --> 07:37.767
Have you?

07:49.148 --> 07:51.884
Just... just... just get out.

07:53.622 --> 07:54.739
Get out!

08:05.658 --> 08:07.791
I must have missed
the order for the cell toss.

08:07.871 --> 08:10.285
You didn't. But as this is my prison,

08:10.406 --> 08:17.246
I can search any cell
at any time, at my discretion.

08:17.368 --> 08:19.017
Thought you didn't like
getting your hands dirty.

08:19.137 --> 08:22.075
I'm beginning to think that
policy might have to change.

08:25.496 --> 08:28.191
It's a good likeness,
don't you think?

08:28.311 --> 08:29.943
I can do one for your office
if you like.

08:40.101 --> 08:42.234
Could someone be a
mother to that child!

08:45.976 --> 08:47.585
Do you want me to
try settle him, Dor?

08:47.707 --> 08:51.407
I just didn't get much sleep
last night, OK? I think it's...

09:10.199 --> 09:14.544
Hey.
Don't you fuckin' touch me!

09:14.665 --> 09:17.401
Luce, just relax, OK?
I'm here to help you.

09:17.481 --> 09:19.935
Don't come fuckin' near me!

09:20.016 --> 09:21.827
Shh!

09:21.907 --> 09:23.396
Just listen.

09:23.517 --> 09:25.609
You're going to put
all your weight on me.

09:25.730 --> 09:27.581
The fuck?
I promise I'll be gentle.

09:27.702 --> 09:30.277
On three.
Watch my fuckin' ribs.

09:30.358 --> 09:31.886
I promise I will, love.

09:31.967 --> 09:35.105
One, two, three.

09:35.186 --> 09:37.681
Ah! Ah! Ah!

09:40.296 --> 09:42.348
That's alright. That's alright.

09:42.429 --> 09:44.239
Oh!

09:44.359 --> 09:46.815
Shit, that
sounds really painful, Juice.

09:46.896 --> 09:50.114
What happened to your ankle?

09:50.235 --> 09:51.844
Can you tell us
who did this to you?

09:51.924 --> 09:53.373
I didn't tell no-one.

09:53.454 --> 09:55.023
I'm not a fuckin' lagger.

09:55.103 --> 09:57.075
Yeah, I know you're not a lagger.

09:57.196 --> 10:00.738
Did you think Juice was a lagger?
No. She's a smart cookie.

10:00.858 --> 10:02.265
Fuck off.
Yeah.

10:05.244 --> 10:06.651
Hey!

10:06.773 --> 10:08.729
And that's why you're going to tell
everyone

10:08.740 --> 10:10.675
it was Ferguson
who put you in this chair.

10:10.797 --> 10:13.492
Oh, get fucked!
Hey...

10:13.613 --> 10:15.665
Ah!
You watch your language.

10:15.684 --> 10:17.272
Remember who you're speaking to.
Fuck!

10:17.314 --> 10:19.367
Thank you, Maxine.

10:19.488 --> 10:22.424
There are worse things than
the Freak being on your case, Juice.

10:22.505 --> 10:24.235
Yeah, like what?

10:24.960 --> 10:28.540
Oh, loneliness. Isolation. No crew.

10:28.620 --> 10:30.351
No mates.

10:30.472 --> 10:33.029
You know life in here can be
pretty brutal without any support.

10:33.039 --> 10:36.266
Especially when you're
sitting in your own shit.

10:38.037 --> 10:42.222
You might be top dog and the dog's
bollocks,

10:42.302 --> 10:44.354
but I'm nobody's bitch.

10:45.521 --> 10:49.304
Now give me some privacy so
I can back one out in peace.

10:51.154 --> 10:52.642
Want some peace, do ya?

10:58.477 --> 11:00.770
You be careful what you wish for.

11:24.015 --> 11:25.984
Hey, Stell?
Here we go.

11:26.064 --> 11:27.189
Three, two, one.

11:27.269 --> 11:29.198
Have a seat.

11:31.609 --> 11:32.774
Bingo.

11:33.898 --> 11:36.873
Do you think death by 1,000 cuts
will work on Ferguson?

11:36.953 --> 11:39.765
Only takes one to open an artery.

11:39.885 --> 11:41.372
He's colicky, love,
that's all it is.

11:41.492 --> 11:43.300
And Arty used to be exactly
the same.

11:43.421 --> 11:45.410
He'd get gassed up and there was
nothing you could do,

11:45.429 --> 11:47.800
and he had lungs on him like a
bloody trombone.

11:47.921 --> 11:49.408
He won't feed, Liz.
No, he will.

11:49.528 --> 11:52.582
He will, love, when he's hungry.
But you need to eat too.

11:52.702 --> 11:55.675
Oh, no. No. The thought of it's just
turning my stomach.

11:55.796 --> 11:57.765
Look, I
must be doing something wrong.

11:57.844 --> 12:00.256
You are not doing anything wrong.

12:00.335 --> 12:02.064
Here, pass him over to Aunty Liz.

12:02.185 --> 12:05.749
Come on, love. That's good, Joshy.
That's the way. Come to Lizzie.

12:05.760 --> 12:07.086
Here you go, Dor.
That's the way.

12:07.106 --> 12:08.673
I put extra sugar
in it to pep you up.

12:08.693 --> 12:11.947
Oh, thanks Jess.
Come to Jess!

12:12.027 --> 12:14.198
Righto, righto.

12:14.278 --> 12:17.251
You right?

12:17.331 --> 12:20.546
Jessie loves her Joshy.

12:20.625 --> 12:22.915
Yes, she does.

12:25.527 --> 12:27.979
Franky.
What's up?

12:28.058 --> 12:30.711
Um, she's coming in tomorrow.

12:30.791 --> 12:33.363
The wife of the cyclist I...

12:35.371 --> 12:36.858
The social worker from the court,

12:36.978 --> 12:38.946
she said I could take
someone in with me.

12:39.027 --> 12:41.478
You know, for support.

12:41.600 --> 12:43.366
What time?
11:00

12:43.487 --> 12:47.828
Yeah, I'm going to be up to my
neck in meal prep. Sorry, kiddo.

12:57.912 --> 12:59.760
Leave.
Governor.

12:59.840 --> 13:01.286
Ms Miles.

13:03.335 --> 13:07.394
I need you to bring up
the security access Log for me.

13:07.474 --> 13:08.920
Sure, I can do that.

13:11.492 --> 13:12.978
For which time period?

13:13.097 --> 13:15.510
9pm last night to
7am this morning.

13:17.598 --> 13:22.059
I need to know who accessed
my office. Just do it.

13:24.991 --> 13:28.005
One result.

13:28.126 --> 13:32.224
This access key used. Can you
confirm the officer it belongs to?

13:32.305 --> 13:34.031
Sure.

13:43.016 --> 13:45.388
Governor, you wanted to see me.

13:50.253 --> 13:52.504
Close the door.

14:07.701 --> 14:11.238
How was your night shift?
Fine. Uneventful.

14:12.845 --> 14:16.625
3:46 am, you accessed this office.

14:16.744 --> 14:21.527
Why?
I'm sorry?

14:23.901 --> 14:27.076
I should have seen it coming.
It's been brewing for months.

14:27.197 --> 14:28.927
Ever since your carelessness in the
riot

14:29.046 --> 14:32.223
resulted in a Hepatitis infection,
for which you irrationally blame me.

14:32.243 --> 14:33.429
Governor, I have no idea what
you're...

14:33.509 --> 14:34.634
What are your intentions?

14:34.715 --> 14:37.126
What's your little plan?

14:37.207 --> 14:39.057
Blackmail me?

14:39.176 --> 14:41.991
Force me to resign
so you can sit in this

14:42.113 --> 14:45.287
big chair you've coveted for years?
I don't know what you think...

14:45.367 --> 14:48.021
Do not lie to me!

14:49.830 --> 14:51.840
If you think
you have the upper hand here, Vera,

14:51.921 --> 14:53.730
you can just think again.

14:53.850 --> 14:56.262
Because I have documented evidence
that you deliberately concealed your

14:56.383 --> 14:59.036
medical status from your employer.
Because you told me to...

14:59.156 --> 15:02.012
You continued to participate in Code
Black events involving open wounds,

15:02.132 --> 15:05.267
thereby recklessly putting
prisoners in harm's way.

15:05.388 --> 15:08.725
You know, if you try to use this
against me,

15:10.011 --> 15:12.221
I will annihilate you.

15:16.684 --> 15:18.051
You will what?

15:18.493 --> 15:19.740
I trusted you.

15:20.784 --> 15:22.393
I mentored you.

15:22.514 --> 15:27.459
You... you were a pathetic mouse
of a prison officer

15:27.578 --> 15:29.387
before I moulded
you into the woman you are today.

15:29.468 --> 15:30.473
You moulded me?

15:30.595 --> 15:33.850
You were nothing until I took you
under my wing!

15:33.930 --> 15:37.066
You used me. You manipulated me.

15:37.147 --> 15:38.876
You manipulate everyone.

15:38.956 --> 15:40.966
And for what?

15:41.087 --> 15:44.182
I know you were behind what
happened to Jodie Spiteri.

15:44.302 --> 15:46.834
I am equally certain
everything Bea Smith claimed

15:46.957 --> 15:49.327
about being attacked is true.
I don't pretend to understand

15:49.447 --> 15:51.981
your intentions, but I do know
you are not fit to be Governor.

16:13.495 --> 16:17.032
Hey, Mr Bakula.
Have you been working out?

16:17.154 --> 16:20.127
I've been looking for a
training partner, though.

16:20.207 --> 16:22.860
Oh, really?

16:22.941 --> 16:24.669
Let me help.

16:26.358 --> 16:28.849
I'm sorry.
Look, I said I'm alright, OK?

16:28.970 --> 16:32.589
Yep. Well, don't say I
didn't offer to help.

16:34.639 --> 16:37.172
Doyle!

16:41.231 --> 16:42.437
What is it?

16:50.800 --> 16:52.775
Well, you've read it.
Just tell me what's in it.

17:05.632 --> 17:07.079
Congratulations.

17:20.025 --> 17:21.992
You got it?

17:24.686 --> 17:25.814
Good.

17:52.868 --> 17:54.234
Hey!

17:54.784 --> 17:56.072
Hey, hey, hey.

17:59.007 --> 18:00.014
You right?

18:01.099 --> 18:06.933
I thought I could, but I
can't face her. I can't.

18:07.014 --> 18:08.582
It's alright, love.

18:08.702 --> 18:11.518
Shh. Just breathe.
Just breathe, darl.

18:11.639 --> 18:14.617
We've all got to face our demons
sooner or later, love.

18:16.225 --> 18:17.714
I'm really scared.

18:17.793 --> 18:19.482
I know, I know. I know you are.

18:19.602 --> 18:21.614
And that's because it's
bloody scary.

18:23.182 --> 18:24.190
Hey?

18:25.194 --> 18:26.764
Will you come with me?

18:29.057 --> 18:30.224
Of course I will.

18:33.844 --> 18:35.131
One more. One more.

18:35.210 --> 18:36.338
Not enough, one more.

18:36.457 --> 18:37.704
Oh, come on.
Come on, one more.

18:37.786 --> 18:40.159
Turning me on, Red!

18:42.090 --> 18:43.296
Whoa!

18:43.377 --> 18:44.813
You need to up the oestrogen, Maxie.

18:44.822 --> 18:46.355
Biceps are bigger than your boobs.

18:46.476 --> 18:47.841
You make it really hard to love you
sometimes, Franky.

18:47.922 --> 18:49.409
Relax, I'm just pulling ya dick.

18:49.490 --> 18:50.619
Hey.

18:52.347 --> 18:55.564
What's going on?
I'm just getting ready for the ball.

18:55.685 --> 18:59.428
I'm talking about Ferguson
tossing your cell, smartarse.

18:59.549 --> 19:01.879
She's rattled.
So, you're making a move, right?

19:01.960 --> 19:03.932
What's your plan?

19:04.053 --> 19:08.075
No. No, you've gotta keep your
head down. Think about your parole.

19:09.926 --> 19:11.978
My parole's fucked.

19:12.098 --> 19:14.190
So, I want in.
Help you finish what we started.

19:14.269 --> 19:15.799
No.

19:15.879 --> 19:17.608
No way.

19:17.689 --> 19:19.378
You're no use to me.

19:19.459 --> 19:22.639
You should be concentrating on what you're
going to do when you get out of here.

19:22.759 --> 19:26.499
That's not your call.
Oh, yeah. It is.

19:33.141 --> 19:37.208
Thank you. Thank you all for
attending at such short notice.

19:37.289 --> 19:39.623
I will be brief.

19:39.704 --> 19:41.394
It has come to my attention

19:41.514 --> 19:46.909
that a certain officer
amongst the staff has been

19:46.989 --> 19:49.123
actively undermining my position.

19:50.774 --> 19:53.712
Now, we work in a highly stressful
environment

19:53.793 --> 19:56.530
where absolute trust is paramount,

19:56.651 --> 20:00.033
and I am sorry to say that I have
lost complete faith and trust

20:00.113 --> 20:03.656
in the Deputy Governor.

20:05.630 --> 20:10.137
Ms Bennett's actions,
though regrettable,

20:10.219 --> 20:12.071
are understandable.

20:12.191 --> 20:16.900
She has been under duress, due to a
recent contraction of Hepatitis C.

20:17.021 --> 20:20.483
Nevertheless, her position as
second-in-charge is no longer tenable.

20:20.604 --> 20:23.824
I will be removing her from
the Deputy Governorship as of today.

20:23.945 --> 20:27.207
She will continue on as an officer
but her respons-

20:27.287 --> 20:29.622
Governor Ferguson?

20:29.743 --> 20:31.112
Detective, we are in the middle of a
meeting.

20:31.193 --> 20:32.804
I'm sorry for interrupting,

20:32.924 --> 20:35.580
but I need Mr Jackson to
accompany me into the city.

20:37.674 --> 20:40.208
Is this in relation to
the murder of Harry Smith?

20:40.289 --> 20:42.141
Well, I can't comment on that.

20:42.222 --> 20:45.081
Of course not.

20:45.201 --> 20:48.018
If it can't wait?
No, I'm afraid not.

20:48.099 --> 20:50.311
Mr Jackson?

20:56.432 --> 20:58.366
Jesus Christ.

21:07.100 --> 21:11.208
Did you set Vera up to
take the fall? Huh? Did you? Yeah.

21:11.287 --> 21:13.743
I had to divert suspicion from you.

21:13.824 --> 21:14.869
Fuck it.

21:14.952 --> 21:16.214
She was never part of our deal.

21:16.239 --> 21:18.372
Look, we need to isolate Ferguson,
OK?

21:18.493 --> 21:20.869
That means driving a
wedge between her and Ms Bennett.

21:20.990 --> 21:23.123
No, no! Shafting Vera was
never part of the plan, Bea!

21:23.163 --> 21:25.136
Collateral damage.

21:25.257 --> 21:28.035
She threw her lot in with
Ferguson from the start.

21:28.115 --> 21:31.455
That makes her fair game.

21:31.534 --> 21:33.308
You're just as bad as she is.

21:42.728 --> 21:44.982
Alright, Boomer?
Mm.

21:49.048 --> 21:51.059
Hey, what's up?

21:52.992 --> 21:54.724
You heard about Franky?

21:56.213 --> 21:57.299
Psst!

21:58.468 --> 22:00.481
Christ, Conway, you scared the crap
out of me.

22:00.561 --> 22:02.373
I'm sorry, Ms Miles.

22:05.350 --> 22:07.244
Bea says thank you.
Piece of piss.

22:07.363 --> 22:10.022
Year 10 computer
science finally came in handy.

22:10.143 --> 22:12.316
Now, I trust it won't
end up in the pokies.

22:12.397 --> 22:14.410
No. Dogs, maybe.

22:14.751 --> 22:17.451
Fuck off!
Get back! Oh, fuck.

22:18.902 --> 22:20.270
The fucking lot of ya.

22:20.351 --> 22:22.406
Get fuckin' lost!

22:23.614 --> 22:25.429
Jesus fuckin' Christ!

22:25.510 --> 22:28.574
Hey, Franky. Can I've a word?

22:29.336 --> 22:31.072
Ow! Fuck!

22:32.643 --> 22:34.496
Congrats on your parole.

22:36.147 --> 22:38.282
Apparently, you knew before
we had our little chat.

22:38.366 --> 22:39.413
And what's your point?

22:39.533 --> 22:43.242
You're willing to sacrifice everything
for a little bit of payback, are ya?

22:43.363 --> 22:46.423
Well, you'd know all
about that, wouldn't you?

22:46.547 --> 22:50.253
It'll really disappoint me
if you fuck up your parole.

22:50.333 --> 22:52.227
Ferguson's not going to let
me out of here. You know that.

22:52.308 --> 22:53.839
Nah, she can't stop you now.

22:53.919 --> 22:56.780
You don't fuckin' get it, Red.

22:56.862 --> 22:58.675
What don't I get?

22:58.756 --> 23:01.055
Huh? What don't I fuckin' get?

23:02.826 --> 23:04.437
I told Bridget something -

23:04.558 --> 23:06.502
something bad I'd done,
and someone recorded it.

23:08.385 --> 23:10.726
Is this about Meg Jackson?

23:12.740 --> 23:14.392
How do you know about that?

23:14.472 --> 23:16.527
Never mind.

23:16.648 --> 23:19.347
Who's got the recording?
Mr Jackson.

23:19.469 --> 23:21.966
Is he gonna take it to the cops?
It doesn't matter.

23:22.089 --> 23:23.851
It was illegally recorded.
It's inadmissible.

23:23.861 --> 23:25.353
OK, so what's your problem then?

23:25.474 --> 23:27.931
The problem
is, Ferguson was behind it.

23:28.013 --> 23:29.502
She's got it in for me.

23:29.624 --> 23:32.646
The only way I'm getting out of here
is in a box, unless she goes first.

23:32.768 --> 23:36.637
No, I don't want your help,
and I don't need it.

23:36.717 --> 23:38.690
So, you just stay out of my way.

23:54.951 --> 23:56.198
Hey.

23:56.278 --> 23:58.486
Are you fuckin' with me head?

24:00.092 --> 24:01.780
No. I'm cleaning, actually.

24:01.859 --> 24:03.907
No, don't do that.

24:04.028 --> 24:08.045
And you give me that moopy
look and you say things like,

24:08.166 --> 24:09.872
you know, "Oh, don't say
I didn't offer to help."

24:09.893 --> 24:10.977
Hey, I was being...
What was that, eh?

24:11.058 --> 24:12.144
I was being serious.

24:12.265 --> 24:14.793
You know, if you are fucking with me
head then stop, alright?

24:14.913 --> 24:17.202
Just stop! Because I'm fucked up
enough, OK?

24:17.325 --> 24:20.136
I want a baby,
and you've got the spoof!

24:20.256 --> 24:22.786
Hey, can we please,
please, can we call it sperm?

24:22.867 --> 24:24.472
Yeah, whatever!

24:24.554 --> 24:25.998
I...

24:28.251 --> 24:32.465
Booms, has this got
anything to do with Franky?

24:32.584 --> 24:35.759
No, I want a baby!
I think you want Franky.

24:37.451 --> 24:38.891
I'm not gay.

24:39.013 --> 24:42.103
You miss her, and now she's getting
out.

24:42.183 --> 24:44.956
OK? You're lonely.

24:47.890 --> 24:51.424
I got nothing.
Oh, no, no, no, love.

24:51.504 --> 24:54.234
That is so not true.

24:54.315 --> 24:55.441
What have I got?

24:57.007 --> 24:59.575
No, you said...
you said you didn't...

24:59.656 --> 25:03.995
Sue Jenkins, you've got me.

25:04.116 --> 25:05.641
Have I?
Yes.

25:05.760 --> 25:08.492
Really?
Mm-hm. Come here, you.

25:08.573 --> 25:11.546
Come on. Oh!

25:11.627 --> 25:14.236
There you go. Oh!

25:14.357 --> 25:16.647
Oh, jeez.
Were you just...?

25:16.768 --> 25:20.863
Fuck no.
I love you, but...

25:20.944 --> 25:23.153
like a sister.

25:23.234 --> 25:25.724
My sister's a fuckin' slut.

25:27.287 --> 25:29.863
Franky?
Yeah?

25:29.982 --> 25:33.157
I heard you got your parole
approved.

25:33.238 --> 25:35.048
Yeah, that's right.

25:35.169 --> 25:37.038
Yeah, well, you should
be over the bloody moon.

25:37.118 --> 25:38.327
Should I?

25:38.347 --> 25:41.563
You're not worried about it, are
ya? You're going to be fine.

25:41.644 --> 25:44.138
You'll eat it up.

25:44.260 --> 25:46.829
You ever had a premonition, Liz?
No.

25:46.949 --> 25:49.164
I'm
never getting out of here alive.

25:49.285 --> 25:52.541
Oh, now, that is just
your fear talking, yeah?

26:01.066 --> 26:04.563
Come on, mate. Come on! Oh!

26:06.654 --> 26:08.987
It's been ages since you fed.

26:09.107 --> 26:12.002
Come on, you've gotta be
hungry by now, babe. Come on.

26:12.124 --> 26:15.258
Maybe it's time to
put him on a bottle. What?

26:15.381 --> 26:18.918
Well, then I can help feed and you
don't have to go through the hassle.

26:19.038 --> 26:25.393
Breastfeeding's not a hassle, Jess.
I just...

26:25.473 --> 26:27.848
I don't know what to do.

26:30.258 --> 26:33.555
Do you know where Liz is?
Getting drunk, for all I know.

26:33.636 --> 26:35.970
Please, can you find her for me?

26:36.089 --> 26:39.185
But you don't need Liz.
You've got me.

26:39.306 --> 26:43.769
Please, I just need you to find Liz.
Please.

26:53.461 --> 26:56.477
Ms Atkins, I've
got Spiteri from the Psych Unit.

26:56.557 --> 26:58.850
Yes, Jodie. Hi. Come take a seat.

26:58.930 --> 27:01.343
We need to change that dressing.

27:04.358 --> 27:07.574
Alright, let's have a look.

27:07.657 --> 27:09.467
It's a bit weepy, Jodie.

27:09.586 --> 27:12.883
I'm just gonna get some saline
solution to irrigate it. OK?

27:16.824 --> 27:18.270
Your eye.

27:22.813 --> 27:25.629
Now, you need to tell me what
you know about Ferguson.

27:27.319 --> 27:32.464
When she was a guard at Blackmoore,
I... I caught her with Jianna.

27:32.583 --> 27:36.808
When Jianna's
bub got taken, Ferguson lost it.

27:36.930 --> 27:39.623
Who took the baby?
A social worker.

27:39.743 --> 27:41.755
And then what happened?
Did Jianna kill herself?

27:43.201 --> 27:48.471
How do you know that?
Cos I've heard this story before.

27:48.549 --> 27:50.681
Then you heard it wrong.

27:50.762 --> 27:53.215
Jianna didn't kill herself.

27:53.335 --> 27:57.157
It was the prisoners,
because of Ferguson.

28:01.823 --> 28:03.306
Fletch.

28:04.391 --> 28:06.402
Vera, I've gotta leave work.

28:07.891 --> 28:10.585
What? What do you mean?
There's something I've gotta do.

28:12.516 --> 28:14.085
Fletch, we're
already short-staffed!

28:14.164 --> 28:16.779
I can't cover for you and Will!

28:30.570 --> 28:34.391
2:17am. Morning of the 25th.

28:34.471 --> 28:36.520
Spencer's Lake.

28:36.642 --> 28:39.979
CCTV camera on the boathouse.
It's not me.

28:42.152 --> 28:46.334
GP062. Sound familiar?

28:46.455 --> 28:48.183
What were you throwing in the lake,
Will?

28:48.266 --> 28:49.872
It's not me.

28:49.992 --> 28:51.602
It's your bike.
It must have been stolen.

28:51.722 --> 28:53.931
There's no stolen vehicle report.
First thing I checked.

28:53.973 --> 28:57.792
OK, they must have taken it during
the night and then returned it.

28:57.915 --> 29:02.055
Come on, mate. Do you know
how ridiculous that sounds?

29:02.134 --> 29:03.825
That's not my helmet or jacket!

29:05.756 --> 29:07.928
What did you throw into the water?

29:08.008 --> 29:10.060
I'm telling you, it's not me.

29:10.179 --> 29:11.867
Police divers are currently
searching the lake!

29:11.988 --> 29:14.080
They will find whatever it is you
tossed in there!

29:14.200 --> 29:16.370
I didn't throw anything in the
fucking lake!

29:16.492 --> 29:18.786
Listen, Will, you come clean now,
it'll go better for you.

29:18.906 --> 29:20.876
But if you wait until my divers
come up with the goods...

29:20.955 --> 29:22.244
Are you arresting me?

29:25.219 --> 29:27.950
Are you charging me
with a crime, Detective?

29:48.259 --> 29:50.029
Oh, shit.

30:01.610 --> 30:03.300
I remember everything.

30:09.298 --> 30:10.701
Feel better after your shower?

30:11.623 --> 30:14.107
No, not really. I'm just exhausted.

30:14.227 --> 30:18.354
Yeah. So is the little one.
He's finally asleep.

30:18.436 --> 30:19.916
Thank god.

30:20.035 --> 30:22.604
Why don't I take him back
to H2 and put him down?

30:22.683 --> 30:25.810
That'd be great. Thanks, Jess.

30:25.889 --> 30:27.129
Sure.

30:56.183 --> 30:57.948
Ms Ferguson?

31:01.834 --> 31:03.117
I heard you.

31:06.563 --> 31:12.372
Just after you gave birth...
you told Smith about us.

31:14.495 --> 31:20.905
And then... you laughed at me
and called me a freak.

31:27.318 --> 31:28.802
I trusted you.

31:41.865 --> 31:46.435
Joshua? Josh? Joshua?

32:09.745 --> 32:10.805
Nurse Atkins?

32:10.823 --> 32:12.506
Yes?
How's Doreen going?

32:12.527 --> 32:14.940
Oh, she's got a high temp
and she's having a bit of trouble

32:14.953 --> 32:18.459
getting Josh to feed. I'm going to
try her now with an express pump.

32:18.518 --> 32:21.034
Well, I
wasn't gonna say anything,

32:21.043 --> 32:24.769
but with Joshie crying so much...
Yeah?

32:24.990 --> 32:27.596
This morning, when Doreen was trying
to settle him,

32:27.677 --> 32:30.401
I walked into her cell, and...

32:30.523 --> 32:32.924
What?
She was yelling at him.

32:33.045 --> 32:36.491
Mm-hm.
And I mean really screaming.

32:36.611 --> 32:39.177
And I'm only telling you because
I'm really worried what might

32:39.208 --> 32:41.655
happen if she's left alone
with him here all night.

32:44.098 --> 32:47.143
Well,
new mothers can get overwhelmed.

32:47.263 --> 32:49.989
Maybe Doreen could do with
a respite from the baby

32:50.070 --> 32:51.871
and get a good night's sleep.

32:51.993 --> 32:54.196
Yeah, I was thinking that too.
Mm-hm.

32:54.276 --> 32:56.198
Yes, you are.

32:58.203 --> 33:00.045
Hey, Jess.

33:00.125 --> 33:01.467
What do you want?

33:01.547 --> 33:02.710
Oh, I just heard about Dor

33:02.829 --> 33:05.051
and I thought I'd just come and
check Josh is being looked after.

33:05.071 --> 33:07.101
Of course Josh is being looked
after!

33:07.110 --> 33:10.279
Hey! Yeah, well just be gentle,
Jess.

33:10.579 --> 33:13.062
Don't tell me how to handle Joshy.

33:13.143 --> 33:15.790
You're not his carer - I am.

33:15.800 --> 33:18.046
You're too much of a drunken
old slag to be trusted.

33:19.207 --> 33:20.494
There's no need for that, love.

33:20.528 --> 33:23.051
Doreen's just lucky she saw your
true colours in time.

33:24.776 --> 33:28.302
Before you had a chance to get
your boozy old hands all over him.

33:31.029 --> 33:32.588
It was you, wasn't it?

33:32.712 --> 33:35.955
You're the one that
planted the grog in my cell.

33:38.071 --> 33:39.752
I didn't make you drink it, did I?

33:50.840 --> 33:52.043
How's Anderson?

33:52.161 --> 33:53.984
I'm just waiting on a blood
test to come back.

33:54.066 --> 33:55.146
I'll be with you in a minute.

33:55.167 --> 33:56.870
I just need to finish
this delivery first.

33:56.933 --> 33:58.713
Cheers.
Thank you.

33:58.733 --> 34:02.058
Ms Miles, why are you the only
officer manning this desk?

34:02.139 --> 34:03.648
We're two officers down, Governor.

34:04.423 --> 34:06.828
Mr Jackson,
didn't expect to see you again.

34:08.989 --> 34:10.594
I trust everything's OK?

34:10.675 --> 34:11.876
It will be, Governor.

34:13.599 --> 34:16.245
Ms Bennett, why are
we two officers down?

34:16.324 --> 34:17.726
We're not, with Mr Jackson back.

34:17.848 --> 34:19.891
Well then, Ms Bennett, why are we
one officer down?

34:19.971 --> 34:21.612
Mr Fletcher left earlier.

34:21.734 --> 34:23.978
Why?
He didn't offer an explanation.

34:24.097 --> 34:25.800
Well, then you'll
have to cover for him.

34:25.860 --> 34:27.367
I'm already at the end of a double.

34:27.391 --> 34:29.987
But you spent so little of your time
last night actually working.

34:32.072 --> 34:34.237
Put Mr Fletcher on
permanent stress leave.

34:34.476 --> 34:36.399
That's a job for
the Deputy Governor.

34:38.523 --> 34:40.407
Whoever that is.

34:42.331 --> 34:44.696
Consider it your final deed.

35:34.546 --> 35:36.188
Ferguson killed Harry.

35:38.032 --> 35:39.755
What? How do you know?

35:39.875 --> 35:43.122
Fletch remembered.
Ferguson's got it in for me.

35:43.243 --> 35:46.525
I think she tried to set
me up for Harry's murder.

35:46.648 --> 35:48.971
Why? It goes back to when I was a
social worker,

35:49.091 --> 35:50.854
and she
was an officer at Blackmoore.

35:50.974 --> 35:54.181
I took a baby away from a prisoner.
Jianna.

35:54.261 --> 35:56.344
What? You... you know?

35:58.990 --> 36:00.992
Yeah, but I didn't know that you
were involved.

36:02.875 --> 36:05.441
Yeah, but I fucked up though, Bea.

36:05.560 --> 36:08.645
Police have me on CCTV getting
rid of the splitter head.

36:08.767 --> 36:10.489
If they find it,
they're going to arrest me.

36:20.549 --> 36:25.518
The guy who attacked me is
the guy who tried to kill Fletch.

36:25.597 --> 36:27.723
In here is his DNA.

36:27.843 --> 36:30.645
He works for Ferguson.
Well, how did you get it?

36:30.726 --> 36:33.451
My nails. I scratched him.

36:33.571 --> 36:36.216
You give that to the cops, it'll
match the DNA on Harry's body.

36:38.700 --> 36:42.066
But they don't know who the DNA
belongs to, so what's the point?

36:42.187 --> 36:45.512
His name, Bea.
I need to know his name.

36:55.733 --> 37:00.141
For fuck's sake, Stell, give me a
break. I can't do this on me own.

37:00.258 --> 37:02.104
You can piss your
pants, for all I care.

37:04.307 --> 37:05.428
Fuck off.

37:05.790 --> 37:08.556
I'll never take help
from a screw with a cock.

37:08.636 --> 37:09.755
Suit yourself.

37:12.001 --> 37:14.124
I'll deal with her, Mr Bakula.

37:20.502 --> 37:23.238
Where are you taking me?

37:23.318 --> 37:26.855
This isn't the way to the dunny.

37:37.988 --> 37:40.600
You didn't answer my question.

37:41.487 --> 37:43.777
You got out of the riot, didn't ya?

37:43.858 --> 37:45.426
What's the big fuckin' deal?

37:51.978 --> 37:53.585
Unless you got jabbed.

37:54.913 --> 37:57.285
You copped a dose of Hep C,
didn't ya?

37:58.773 --> 38:01.464
Welcome to my world, Vinegar Tits!

38:01.908 --> 38:04.601
So, it was your blood.

38:04.682 --> 38:06.290
Oh!

38:08.058 --> 38:11.151
What are you gonna do?
Throw me down the stairs?

38:12.400 --> 38:13.846
Why shouldn't I?

38:16.379 --> 38:19.756
You're just a fucking
filthy drug abuser.

38:22.046 --> 38:28.438
I...I caught Hep from some dodgy
blood, when I had my hysterectomy.

38:28.518 --> 38:31.051
But what would you care?

38:31.174 --> 38:33.665
I'm just a fat,
worthless slag, right?

38:33.788 --> 38:37.323
And you're just a crazy,
fucked up bitch!

38:37.403 --> 38:39.855
Go on! Do it.

38:41.101 --> 38:42.106
I dare ya.

38:43.472 --> 38:46.689
Go on. Do it, ya fuckin' gutless
wonder!

38:46.771 --> 38:49.061
Ya got a face like a slapped arse!

38:49.140 --> 38:52.117
Do it, Vinegar Tits! Do it!

38:55.290 --> 38:57.100
Ah!

39:12.238 --> 39:15.761
Lucy, can you hear me?

39:15.771 --> 39:18.813
An ambulance is on its way.
You took a tumble down the stairs.

39:18.849 --> 39:21.212
Can you hear me, Lucy? Yes?

39:25.774 --> 39:28.098
What's your last name?

39:28.276 --> 39:29.880
It's Gam- Gambaro.

39:29.999 --> 39:34.000
Good. Alright, I need
you to squeeze my hand.

39:34.121 --> 39:35.922
Can you squeeze my hand for me?
That's good.

39:36.005 --> 39:37.849
Ms Bennett, I heard that Juice had
an accident.

39:37.924 --> 39:39.644
Is she going to be OK?

39:39.725 --> 39:42.667
Do you know what happened to you?

39:42.739 --> 39:44.544
Lucy?

39:46.543 --> 39:50.506
Just tell us what happened, Juice.
Get out, Smith!

39:56.992 --> 40:00.675
Ferguson.
Ms Ferguson, the Governor?

40:02.035 --> 40:04.116
She pushed me.

40:05.878 --> 40:08.160
I saw Ms Ferguson leaving the prison
over an hour ago.

40:11.042 --> 40:12.683
She left me there.

40:14.484 --> 40:15.684
She left me there.

40:28.495 --> 40:31.737
They are all against me.
The prisoners. The officers...

40:31.855 --> 40:34.020
Calm down.
Do not tell me to calm down.

40:34.139 --> 40:36.622
Instead of being angry, you need
to take control of the situation.

40:36.742 --> 40:39.943
I can do both.
No, you are falling apart.

40:40.063 --> 40:42.505
Oh! You've done some terrible things,
Joan.

40:42.586 --> 40:45.147
I have only done what I had to do.

40:45.267 --> 40:47.228
And things you do just to
hurt others.

40:47.309 --> 40:49.270
That's because they need to hurt.

40:49.389 --> 40:52.993
No, no. It's because you
need to see them hurt.

40:53.111 --> 40:56.635
Even as a child, you'd hurt
things just for the sake of it.

40:56.756 --> 40:58.899
I have only ever done
what you taught me.

40:58.910 --> 41:01.440
I never taught you to blame
others for your own failings.

41:01.519 --> 41:03.440
My failings? Is that what they are?

41:03.519 --> 41:05.040
Yes, your failings.

41:05.163 --> 41:09.685
Oh, I am so sorry to have
been a disappointment to you!

41:09.765 --> 41:11.208
No!

41:11.327 --> 41:14.689
What I need is for a father,
just once in his life, to say

41:14.809 --> 41:18.413
"Well done, Joan.
I am proud of you."

41:18.532 --> 41:22.335
No you haven't! You have
never... never once said to me...

41:22.455 --> 41:24.294
You... you have hectored
and bullied me

41:24.415 --> 41:28.740
and treated me like one of your foot
soldiers, all my life!

41:30.100 --> 41:35.103
What I want is to be good enough!

41:35.224 --> 41:37.906
Why could I never be good enough for
you?

41:43.030 --> 41:44.912
You're insane.

41:46.593 --> 41:49.036
You're fuckin' insane.

41:52.798 --> 41:55.401
And I know what you've done.

42:50.605 --> 42:51.606
I want my baby.

42:51.685 --> 42:53.966
Can you bring me my son, please!

42:54.046 --> 42:55.728
Someone bring me my baby!

42:55.809 --> 42:59.530
Doreen, you need to calm down, OK? We've
spoken about this. You need some rest.

42:59.651 --> 43:02.772
No, I want my son.
It's... I want Josh!

43:02.891 --> 43:04.854
It's more important for you to rest
now.

43:04.934 --> 43:07.096
You need to rest. OK?

43:09.056 --> 43:13.540
No! I want my baby!
Bring me my baby!

43:13.621 --> 43:15.542
He's my son!

43:17.061 --> 43:18.423
I want Joshua!

43:55.891 --> 43:58.174
Take care of Mr Fletcher.

44:04.700 --> 44:06.500
And this time, finish the job.
