WEBVTT

00:16.684 --> 00:18.283
All right,
people, listen up.

00:18.285 --> 00:21.453
We're going in, and we're taking
as many animals as we can.

00:21.455 --> 00:25.624
Now, there's not a lot of time,
so we gotta move quick. Layne?

00:25.626 --> 00:27.659
- Yeah?
- I want you to take your camera

00:27.661 --> 00:30.262
and record everything.
We need to show our investors

00:30.264 --> 00:32.398
that they're getting
their money's worth.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.365
You got it.

00:33.367 --> 00:36.301
Hey, boss,
is Jezel coming with us?

00:36.303 --> 00:37.469
- She's gonna parachute in

00:37.471 --> 00:40.472
and open the gate for us
so we can get in.

00:40.474 --> 00:41.740
Man, she's crazy.

00:41.742 --> 00:44.410
You're telling me.

00:44.412 --> 00:46.278
All right, let's load up!

00:46.280 --> 00:48.580
- Yes, boss!
- Yes, boss!

02:07.394 --> 02:09.461
- You're late.

02:12.133 --> 02:14.266
All right, move in. Layne.

02:14.268 --> 02:16.602
- Yeah, boss?
- You're on inventory.

02:16.604 --> 02:17.903
- Copy.

02:17.905 --> 02:20.539
- Animal cages? Cable nets?
- Check.

02:20.541 --> 02:22.341
- Pheromones?
Tranquilizer darts?

02:22.343 --> 02:23.509
Two pistols and a rifle?

02:23.511 --> 02:25.577
- Check and check.
- Use those sparingly.

02:25.579 --> 02:30.215
- Nobody wants a tiger hide
full of bullet holes.

02:31.752 --> 02:35.587
All right, people. We're in this
for the money. Let's go!

02:38.792 --> 02:41.393
- I've just about
had it with you.

02:47.234 --> 02:48.800
- What's in that stuff?

02:48.802 --> 02:51.737
- Snips and snails
and puppy dog tails.

02:51.739 --> 02:53.405
- Come on. Tell me.

02:53.407 --> 02:56.308
- It's a cocktail
of my own creation,

02:56.310 --> 02:58.443
paralyzes the animal
from within,

02:58.445 --> 03:02.648
and the tiny dart tip penetrates
the skin without damaging it.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.484
- That bastard,
he's gonna give us away.

03:05.486 --> 03:08.687
- Then shut him up.
Let me see that.

03:10.391 --> 03:12.724
Ugh. So much noise.

03:15.429 --> 03:18.764
Now I could think. Let's go.

03:28.442 --> 03:29.708
- Layne, you're with me.

03:29.710 --> 03:32.978
Gentlemen,
you've got Canada's finest.

03:32.980 --> 03:35.847
- Gentlemen, we're going
for the big game.

03:35.849 --> 03:39.284
Jezel, stick close
to the western edge.

03:39.286 --> 03:40.352
- We have to be out by sunrise,

03:40.354 --> 03:43.255
before the rangers
do their morning sweep.

03:43.257 --> 03:46.358
- I'll see you in four hours.

03:46.360 --> 03:47.759
Hey, be careful.

03:47.761 --> 03:50.996
- Aww. You actually care?
- You don't?

03:50.998 --> 03:53.665
- Depends, if you
come back for me.

03:53.667 --> 03:54.733
- Always.
- Ah.

03:54.735 --> 03:58.737
Get out of here before I have to
punch some more sense into you.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.439
- Hmm.

04:00.441 --> 04:01.940
Gentlemen.

04:08.449 --> 04:10.282
- Ah, guess he found his friend.

04:10.284 --> 04:13.352
- Good. Now that they know
what they're up against,

04:13.354 --> 04:15.621
those little thugs
will leave us alone.

04:15.623 --> 04:17.456
- Poor little guy.

04:53.394 --> 04:55.427
- Vedder.

04:55.429 --> 04:56.361
Eyes.

04:56.363 --> 04:58.497
- Copy that, boss.

05:04.672 --> 05:07.706
I didn't know
this zoo had this many animals.

05:07.708 --> 05:09.374
- This isn't a zoo.
It's a refuge.

05:09.376 --> 05:11.610
- What's the difference
between a refuge and a zoo?

05:11.612 --> 05:15.547
- A refuge is where animals go
before they go to the zoo.

05:15.549 --> 05:17.649
You'll do good
to educate yourself.

05:17.651 --> 05:18.383
- Yeah.

05:18.385 --> 05:20.919
- Now help me open this gate.

05:34.668 --> 05:35.701
- Jackpot.

05:35.703 --> 05:38.103
- I'm gonna play
with my new toy.

05:38.105 --> 05:39.638
- Here.

05:40.107 --> 05:41.640
- Dart.

05:44.078 --> 05:47.579
- Hey, will that stuff work on
something as big as an elephant?

05:47.581 --> 05:50.015
- We're about to find out.

05:53.387 --> 05:55.387
- Bro, what was that?

05:55.389 --> 05:57.923
- Don't worry about it.

06:02.396 --> 06:03.862
- Hey, what are those things?

06:03.864 --> 06:04.896
- I don't really know,

06:04.898 --> 06:07.566
but they're
getting around us real fast.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.835
- Hell, no.
- I don't see anything.

06:31.458 --> 06:32.124
Damn!

06:33.060 --> 06:35.861
Ah, shit!

07:15.736 --> 07:17.202
Toronto!

07:18.639 --> 07:22.441
- Vedder! We are leaving!

07:22.443 --> 07:24.776
- Here!
We gotta get out of here, man!

07:34.154 --> 07:36.755
Don't be shy.

07:38.125 --> 07:38.857
Come on out.

07:38.859 --> 07:42.661
Mama Jezel
wants to come out and play.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.066
Give me the bag.

07:59.079 --> 08:00.145
- Ugh. That smell.

08:00.147 --> 08:03.615
- They'll think it's their mom

08:09.756 --> 08:11.590
- Nobody's home.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.826
Wait.

08:18.198 --> 08:20.098
Come on out.

08:21.068 --> 08:22.767
Hi.

08:22.769 --> 08:24.669
I'm your friend.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.705
Get the cage ready.

08:31.512 --> 08:33.812
Come on out to play.

08:35.515 --> 08:38.283
Come on now, baby.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.121
- What's that sound?

08:44.124 --> 08:46.191
- Calm down.
You're scaring him.

08:46.193 --> 08:47.092
- I hear footsteps.

08:47.094 --> 08:49.995
- Stop being paranoid,
and help me.

08:50.597 --> 08:52.097
Get the berries.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.768
Step right in...

08:56.770 --> 08:59.104
just like that.

08:59.873 --> 09:03.208
Mama needs a new pair of shoes.

09:03.944 --> 09:06.044
Just like that.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.045
Got it.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.980
- Easy money.

09:08.982 --> 09:11.116
- Told you.

09:11.118 --> 09:13.151
All right.

09:19.326 --> 09:21.026
- Oh.

09:21.595 --> 09:23.061
Mama porcupine.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.296
Oh, don't be mad.

09:24.298 --> 09:28.733
We just took your baby.
You can have more.

09:37.711 --> 09:40.779
- All right, let's go.

09:40.781 --> 09:42.647
- Stop.

09:42.649 --> 09:43.214
- Layne, run.

09:43.216 --> 09:45.250
Put the gun down

09:45.252 --> 09:46.051
right now.

09:46.053 --> 09:49.921
- Ooh. I love
a man with an accent.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.222
- I said drop it.

09:51.224 --> 09:53.091
- Fine.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.293
Wow, chill.

09:55.295 --> 09:57.262
- How many more are there?

09:58.065 --> 09:59.197
- Porcupines?

09:59.199 --> 10:02.067
- More of you, smartass.

10:04.171 --> 10:06.104
- We came alone.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.707
- You're lying.

10:08.709 --> 10:09.674
Cuff 'em both.

10:09.676 --> 10:12.077
- Told you I heard footsteps.

10:12.079 --> 10:12.911
- Shut up, Layne.

10:12.913 --> 10:15.313
- Why don't you both shut up?

10:17.684 --> 10:18.917
- Hey, little one.

10:18.919 --> 10:21.853
No one's gonna hurt you anymore.

10:23.056 --> 10:24.889
What did you shoot her up with?

10:24.891 --> 10:28.660
- A magic potion. I'm a witch.

10:28.996 --> 10:31.630
- Is this all
some kind of game to you?

10:31.632 --> 10:33.164
- Yes!

10:37.638 --> 10:41.306
Oh, come on. It's not like
they're endangered or anything.

10:41.308 --> 10:46.011
- Take our new friends.
Put 'em in the back of the jeep.

10:48.081 --> 10:51.149
Isaiah, bring a second cage.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.651
I want to keep
the mother separate

10:52.653 --> 10:54.786
until we know
what's going on with her.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.655
- Yeah. You got it.

10:56.957 --> 10:58.423
- It's all right, sweetheart.

10:58.425 --> 11:02.227
I know just the person
who's gonna fix you up.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.333
- Hi, Rosie.

12:17.437 --> 12:19.437
Got a big day.

12:20.307 --> 12:22.507
- Yo. Good news. Bike's fixed.

12:22.509 --> 12:25.176
- K.D., you can be
a mechanic in your next life,

12:25.178 --> 12:28.346
but today, can you please
stick to being a vet?

12:28.348 --> 12:29.748
- Oh, it's her graduation?

12:29.750 --> 12:33.752
- Yeah. She can't stay
in here her whole life.

12:33.754 --> 12:34.786
- That the Ginga vaccine?

12:34.788 --> 12:36.254
- Among other things.
If the herd rejects her,

12:36.256 --> 12:39.491
she'll need as many advantages
as we can give her.

12:39.493 --> 12:41.760
- Aww. She'll be fine.

12:41.762 --> 12:42.927
You think we should sedate her?

12:42.929 --> 12:44.462
- I just gave her
a mild sedative,

12:44.464 --> 12:46.264
but I can't protect her forever.

12:46.266 --> 12:46.965
- Hey.

12:46.967 --> 12:49.834
- They call it a jungle
for a reason.

12:49.836 --> 12:52.303
- Brooke! Hock's on the radio!

12:52.305 --> 12:55.039
- Uh, I'm busy.
Can you take a message?

12:55.041 --> 12:57.308
- He got some poachers.

13:05.786 --> 13:06.951
- Randy, are you okay?

13:06.953 --> 13:07.952
How many poachers are there?

13:07.954 --> 13:09.888
- Two that we know of so far.

13:09.890 --> 13:12.457
We managed to catch 'em
before they did too much damage.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.092
- What kind of damage
are we talking about?

13:14.094 --> 13:17.395
- They shot a crested porcupine
with some kind of toxin.

13:17.397 --> 13:20.064
- Okay, toxin.
Can you be more specific?

13:20.066 --> 13:23.001
- I'm not sure. I need you
to take a look at her

13:23.003 --> 13:24.002
for yourself. Be there soon.

13:24.004 --> 13:26.070
- You're bringing
the poachers here?

13:26.072 --> 13:27.105
- Unless you got a better idea

13:27.107 --> 13:28.406
where we should hold them
for pickup.

13:28.408 --> 13:30.108
- You bring those
animal butchers back here,

13:30.110 --> 13:32.477
and I will not be
held responsible for my actions!

13:32.479 --> 13:35.413
- Easy, Brooke. See you in five.

13:35.415 --> 13:38.082
- She sounds
like quite the charmer.

13:38.084 --> 13:41.820
- Lady, you have no idea.

13:50.363 --> 13:52.163
- We can stay here if you want.

13:52.165 --> 13:56.000
- And let those animal thieves
ruin Rosie's big day? No way.

13:56.002 --> 13:59.404
She's being released back
into the wild as scheduled.

13:59.406 --> 14:00.839
- All right. You heard the boss.

14:00.841 --> 14:04.075
Let's load up Rosie
and take her home.

14:05.245 --> 14:06.010
- Wait.

14:06.012 --> 14:10.081
If you're gonna go out there,
you need protection.

14:10.283 --> 14:13.351
- But we got tranquilizer guns
in the jeep.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.253
- These aren't for the animals.

14:15.255 --> 14:17.055
- You think
there's more poachers.

14:17.057 --> 14:17.922
- Well, if there is,

14:17.924 --> 14:19.557
- then we need to be protected.
- Oh, please.

14:19.559 --> 14:22.260
If you really want
to get back at those poachers,

14:22.262 --> 14:26.164
hose 'em down with these,
animal pheromones.

14:26.166 --> 14:27.565
Then all the cheetahs, boars,

14:27.567 --> 14:30.602
and antelopes of the refuge
would chase 'em down.

14:30.604 --> 14:33.104
- Humped to death by a lion.

14:34.641 --> 14:37.442
- If that don't teach a poacher,
nothing will.

14:37.444 --> 14:41.079
K.D., I'm serious.

14:41.081 --> 14:43.047
You watch yourself out there.

14:43.049 --> 14:44.883
- Yeah.

14:44.885 --> 14:46.150
Come on.

14:49.556 --> 14:54.425
- Logan, let's go prepare
for our guest.

15:01.902 --> 15:02.667
Gotta get out of here.

15:02.669 --> 15:05.503
Wait. No, stop. Stop.
Can't breathe.

15:05.505 --> 15:07.138
Oh, God!

15:07.140 --> 15:08.273
- How bad is it?
- It's bad!

15:08.275 --> 15:09.607
- Let me see.
- It's bad! No!

15:09.609 --> 15:11.376
- Show me. Show me.
- No, no, no.

15:11.378 --> 15:12.443
- Oh, God!

15:12.445 --> 15:14.045
- Oh, God. No.

15:14.047 --> 15:15.013
- Okay. Okay.

15:15.015 --> 15:17.148
Uh, there's first aid
in the truck.

15:17.150 --> 15:18.416
- No. No, I'm not
going back there!

15:18.418 --> 15:19.984
- But you could die
of an infection!

15:19.986 --> 15:22.387
- We'll die if we go back there!
- What do you wanna do?

15:22.389 --> 15:25.924
- We gotta get the hell
out of here, man!

15:25.926 --> 15:26.991
The base must be nearby.

15:26.993 --> 15:28.626
- Whoa! You want us
to turn ourselves in?

15:28.628 --> 15:30.261
- It's better than being dead!

15:32.198 --> 15:33.197
- What animal was that?

15:33.199 --> 15:34.933
- I'm not sticking around
to find out!

15:34.935 --> 15:36.434
- No! We have come too far

15:36.436 --> 15:39.237
and done too much
to get arrested now!

15:39.239 --> 15:41.139
- You wanna die in here?

15:41.675 --> 15:44.142
- The wall, over the wall.
We'll climb over.

15:44.144 --> 15:47.178
- I can't climb with this hand.
- I'll boost you up.

15:47.180 --> 15:50.214
- No. We gotta get
the hell out of this place

15:50.216 --> 15:51.449
before someone else gets killed!

15:51.451 --> 15:52.550
- I am not getting arrested

15:52.552 --> 15:54.986
because you decide
to grow a conscience!

15:54.988 --> 15:56.220
Now get up there!

15:57.657 --> 16:00.325
Move!

16:19.112 --> 16:20.745
- Is the prep area clear?

16:20.747 --> 16:23.247
- Let me see the porcupines.

16:27.220 --> 16:28.720
- How long has she
looked like this?

16:28.722 --> 16:31.389
- She didn't look like that
when I picked her up.

16:31.391 --> 16:35.259
- Is it rabies? Or peritonitis?

16:35.261 --> 16:37.528
- The babies are fine.

16:37.530 --> 16:39.130
- She's gonna chew through that.
- Yeah.

16:39.132 --> 16:42.367
Logan, give me five ccs of
pentobarbital to keep her calm.

16:42.369 --> 16:43.634
- On it.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.473
- Hock, where do you want 'em?

16:49.409 --> 16:50.408
- What did you do to her?

16:50.410 --> 16:52.477
- Lady, you're gonna
have to beat it out of me!

16:52.479 --> 16:54.245
- You're a monster!
- Hey, hey, hey,

16:54.247 --> 16:55.613
calm down.
You're better than that.

16:55.615 --> 16:59.417
We'll get justice, but we'll
do it the right way, okay?

16:59.419 --> 17:01.219
- Jail?

17:01.221 --> 17:02.720
Been there. Done that.

17:02.722 --> 17:04.521
Lock 'em to the bench.

17:04.523 --> 17:06.290
Secure the weapons.

17:07.527 --> 17:11.662
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

17:12.732 --> 17:15.165
- Wow, this is nice.
What is this, Gucci?

17:15.167 --> 17:17.801
- Careful!
That's a custom-made item.

17:17.804 --> 17:18.603
- Let's go.

17:18.605 --> 17:20.204
- So you like
to shoot things, huh?

17:20.205 --> 17:23.074
You have no idea.

17:23.076 --> 17:25.510
Hey, what if
I have to use the potty?

17:25.512 --> 17:27.278
- Use this.

17:31.818 --> 17:32.817
- You gonna be okay?

17:35.455 --> 17:36.687
- I'll behave.
- Okay.

17:36.689 --> 17:39.323
I'm gonna call it in,
organize a pickup.

17:39.325 --> 17:41.526
Okay.

17:41.528 --> 17:43.628
- Logan, where are you? <i> ¡Ándale!</i>

17:43.630 --> 17:47.498
- I'm coming. I'm coming. Sorry.

17:48.802 --> 17:51.536
- Uh, dispatch, this is
Animal Rescue. You read?

17:51.538 --> 17:52.737
- This is dispatch. Over.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.739
I have it.

17:55.075 --> 17:57.475
- Yeah, we're gonna need
a chopper out here stat.

17:57.477 --> 17:58.609
- What's the situation?

17:58.611 --> 18:00.511
- What's the soonest
you can be here?

18:00.513 --> 18:03.247
- In about six hours.
- Six hours?

18:13.293 --> 18:16.160
- I didn't know
they could do that.

18:16.162 --> 18:17.728
- They can't.

18:17.730 --> 18:19.464
- This stuff barely fazed her.

18:19.466 --> 18:20.598
- Give me another five ccs.

18:20.600 --> 18:21.732
- But that'll kill her.

18:21.734 --> 18:23.367
- And the disease
she's carrying can't?

18:23.369 --> 18:26.838
I can't help her until I
calm down her convulsions.

18:27.674 --> 18:29.207
- Here.

18:32.245 --> 18:34.445
- Just get here when you can.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.149
They're sending
a chopper for pickup,

18:38.151 --> 18:39.884
but they won't be here
for six hours.

18:39.886 --> 18:42.320
- Six hours? Randy, really?

18:42.322 --> 18:43.654
They can't get one here
any faster?

18:43.656 --> 18:46.457
- I guess animal thieves aren't
high on the priority list.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.759
- Okay, well,
I don't think I can handle them

18:48.761 --> 18:50.228
being here for six more minutes.

18:50.230 --> 18:52.130
- Well, don't.
Just go to your lab.

18:52.132 --> 18:54.632
I'll take care of them.

18:57.237 --> 19:00.705
- Logan, let's get to work.

19:04.244 --> 19:05.443
In 60 minutes, we'll wake 'em

19:05.445 --> 19:06.711
and do a urine
and alkaline test.

19:06.713 --> 19:09.647
I want to get started right away
on the blood work

19:09.649 --> 19:11.716
to find out a...

19:11.718 --> 19:12.617
a...

19:12.619 --> 19:14.485
- You okay?

19:14.487 --> 19:15.786
- Yeah.

19:15.788 --> 19:18.456
Uh, just the stress, I guess.

19:18.925 --> 19:22.360
- Here. Here's some water.

19:24.330 --> 19:25.296
Look, don't worry.

19:25.298 --> 19:28.833
Those poachers will get
what's coming to 'em.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.202
- Will they?

19:31.704 --> 19:34.272
'Cause what if
there are no consequences?

19:34.274 --> 19:35.740
- Help! Help!

19:35.742 --> 19:38.643
Help me! Help!

19:38.645 --> 19:39.844
- Randy!

19:39.846 --> 19:41.412
- Help!

19:43.650 --> 19:46.450
- Randy! Randy! Randy!

19:46.452 --> 19:47.685
He tried to break in to the lab!

19:47.687 --> 19:49.520
- Who did?
- They're gonna kill us!

19:49.522 --> 19:50.721
They're gonna kill us all!

19:50.723 --> 19:53.191
Close the doors!
Load up the guns!

19:53.193 --> 19:54.859
They're gonna kill us!

19:54.861 --> 19:55.860
- Toronto?

19:55.862 --> 19:57.895
- How many more of you
are out there?

19:57.897 --> 20:00.264
- Dead! Dead! They're all dead.

20:00.266 --> 20:01.532
- Who's dead?
- Everyone!

20:01.534 --> 20:05.203
- Damn it, stop questioning him,
and start helping him!

20:05.205 --> 20:07.905
We'll tell you
everything you want to know!

20:07.907 --> 20:09.373
- Where's he bleeding from?

20:09.375 --> 20:12.243
- Hard to tell.
It's everywhere.

20:12.612 --> 20:13.945
- This isn't his blood.

20:13.947 --> 20:15.713
- Of course it's not my blood!

20:15.715 --> 20:17.848
- They did it!
- Who did this?

20:17.850 --> 20:18.783
- The animals!

20:18.785 --> 20:20.284
- What animals?
- Uh...

20:20.286 --> 20:21.319
they looked like, uh...

20:21.321 --> 20:24.622
some little meerkats
and a rhino.

20:24.991 --> 20:28.392
I swear to God. They did it!

20:28.394 --> 20:29.927
- Killer meerkats?

20:29.929 --> 20:32.363
You high or something?

20:33.499 --> 20:35.333
- He sure is.

20:35.468 --> 20:37.668
- What does that
have to do with anything?

20:37.670 --> 20:40.271
- Why don't you believe me?
- Oh, I believe you.

20:40.273 --> 20:42.506
I believe you're
baked out of your mind.

20:42.508 --> 20:43.674
- I am not high!
- You know,

20:43.676 --> 20:46.410
this stuff
makes you see crazy things.

20:46.412 --> 20:48.312
Sometimes it makes you
do crazy things.

20:48.314 --> 20:49.714
- I didn't kill
any of my friends.

20:49.716 --> 20:52.283
- What happened? They threaten
to take your cut or something?

20:52.285 --> 20:53.884
I don't know
how it works with you guys.

20:53.886 --> 20:56.687
- I didn't kill anybody!
- Prove it.

20:56.689 --> 20:58.623
- I'm not going back out there.
- Cuff him.

20:58.625 --> 21:01.425
- I came here for help!
I came here to warn you!

21:01.427 --> 21:04.395
- And you are gonna help.
We're gonna find your friends.

21:04.397 --> 21:05.830
Some of 'em
might still be alive.

21:05.832 --> 21:08.566
- I'm not going back out there.

21:08.568 --> 21:09.700
- What are you trying to hide?

21:09.702 --> 21:12.837
- Maybe someone's alive,
but I don't think so.

21:12.839 --> 21:14.905
- Put him in the jeep.
- I told you I'm not

21:14.907 --> 21:16.874
going back out there!
Why don't you believe me?

21:16.876 --> 21:18.743
- I'll believe you
once you take me to your pals

21:18.745 --> 21:20.978
and you show me where this animal
attack apparently happened.

21:20.980 --> 21:23.047
- The animals are going crazy!
They want our blood!

21:23.049 --> 21:25.816
- They want revenge!
- Come on, buddy! We're leaving!

21:25.818 --> 21:28.886
- If we go out there,
we're gonna die!

21:33.526 --> 21:37.028
- Don't worry.
He's still conscious.

21:37.030 --> 21:39.630
- What did you do to me?

21:40.533 --> 21:43.034
You don't know
what you're doing.

21:44.337 --> 21:45.569
You're making a mistake.

21:45.571 --> 21:46.737
- Maybe he's telling the truth!

21:46.739 --> 21:48.372
- Toronto wouldn't hurt
any of us.

21:48.374 --> 21:51.876
- The jungle's gonna eat you
and your team alive, warden.

21:51.878 --> 21:54.011
Shut up, and move!

21:54.013 --> 21:57.014
- Looks like I'm
gonna have to break a promise.

21:57.016 --> 21:58.482
- No.
- Yeah. Looks like

21:58.484 --> 22:00.751
you're gonna have
to deal with them after all.

22:00.753 --> 22:02.553
- But what if he's right?

22:02.555 --> 22:04.755
- About the animal attacks?
Come on.

22:04.757 --> 22:05.756
He was high as a hyena.

22:05.758 --> 22:07.091
- You saw
how that porcupine was acting.

22:07.093 --> 22:09.360
Okay, what if other animals
are acting the same way?

22:09.362 --> 22:10.795
- Remember the kids
from Morocco?

22:10.797 --> 22:11.829
- Yeah, the ones who tried

22:11.831 --> 22:12.930
to steal the colobus monkeys.

22:12.932 --> 22:14.498
- The kids were
so high on shrooms,

22:14.500 --> 22:17.001
they probably thought
King Kong was after 'em.

22:17.003 --> 22:18.002
- I suppose.

22:18.004 --> 22:19.370
- You gonna be okay?

22:19.372 --> 22:21.439
I can leave Isaiah here
if you need a hand.

22:21.441 --> 22:23.708
- No. Logan and I
can handle the ladies.

22:23.710 --> 22:26.377
And besides, K.D. and the others
will be back soon.

22:26.379 --> 22:29.480
- Okay. I'll be back soon, too.

22:30.383 --> 22:31.782
- Okay.
- Hey!

22:31.784 --> 22:34.752
- Hey, hey! Can you at least
let us out of this room?

22:34.754 --> 22:36.954
- We won't go anywhere.
We promise.

22:36.956 --> 22:39.957
- You're not going anywhere
until the chopper gets here.

22:39.959 --> 22:41.425
- What if Toronto's right

22:41.427 --> 22:43.828
and the animals come in here
and try to get us?

22:43.830 --> 22:47.064
- Then I guess you'll know what
it feels like to be poached.

22:47.066 --> 22:48.132
- Is that a threat?

22:48.134 --> 22:49.367
Hey! Come back here!

22:49.369 --> 22:52.103
- Hello?
- We're not done!

22:54.707 --> 22:57.775
- Logan, get me the syringe.

23:08.054 --> 23:11.422
Let's see
what's gotten into you.

23:19.399 --> 23:23.634
- My guess is you guys broke in
through the east gate, yeah?

23:23.636 --> 23:25.736
- Hey, he's talking to you!

23:26.639 --> 23:28.839
- I don't remember.

23:29.776 --> 23:31.942
- Listen. Cooperate with me,

23:31.944 --> 23:34.078
I'll make sure your girlfriends
get a good deal

23:34.080 --> 23:36.981
when the authorities
come to pick 'em up.

23:40.920 --> 23:45.890
- Yes. Yeah, we came in
through the east gate,

23:45.892 --> 23:47.725
hiked in a few miles.

23:47.727 --> 23:51.529
- What were you hunting,
aardvarks?

23:51.998 --> 23:53.764
- Elephants.

23:54.667 --> 23:55.166
- Right.

23:55.168 --> 23:58.169
Well, they do share
the same territory.

24:00.440 --> 24:01.806
- Meerkats? No! No!

24:01.808 --> 24:04.675
No, no, no, no!
Turn around right now!

24:04.677 --> 24:06.177
- What, 'cause of meerkats?

24:06.179 --> 24:07.745
- Turn around right now!

24:07.747 --> 24:09.547
- Oh, and, uh,
termites live here, too.

24:09.549 --> 24:12.850
- Yeah, and all the little
animals that suck 'em up.

24:14.520 --> 24:15.786
Hey, good one, brother.

24:16.989 --> 24:19.190
- You guys
are actually brothers?

24:19.192 --> 24:20.124
- Yeah.

24:20.126 --> 24:23.027
- The resemblance is uncanny.

24:24.063 --> 24:27.164
Why are we slowing down?
Are your guns loaded?

24:27.166 --> 24:28.632
- Chill.

24:28.835 --> 24:30.034
I don't see anyone.

24:30.036 --> 24:32.970
There! Right there!

24:39.946 --> 24:41.545
- Isaiah, come with me.

24:41.547 --> 24:43.614
Let's look for survivors.

24:43.616 --> 24:44.548
- Wait!

24:44.550 --> 24:45.983
Wait, wait, wait!
You're leaving?

24:45.985 --> 24:48.819
- Mike, keep an eye
on our friend.

24:48.821 --> 24:49.620
- Copy.

24:49.622 --> 24:51.655
- I showed you
what you wanted me to!

24:51.657 --> 24:52.623
They were killed!

24:52.625 --> 24:54.191
- Stop talking!

24:54.193 --> 24:55.993
- I didn't do it!

24:55.995 --> 24:57.962
Why don't you believe me?

24:58.798 --> 25:01.232
- Meerkats didn't do this.

25:21.654 --> 25:23.888
Body parts everywhere.

25:26.993 --> 25:28.559
Stay back.

25:41.774 --> 25:44.208
Oh!

25:57.023 --> 25:59.123
- What the hell is that?

26:02.628 --> 26:04.862
- Yeah, what is that?

26:13.873 --> 26:15.973
- Isaiah!

26:15.975 --> 26:17.841
- Hit it!

26:20.713 --> 26:22.046
- Oh, man!

26:22.048 --> 26:25.583
- Get it off!

26:26.752 --> 26:28.686
- Come on! Hit it!

26:30.890 --> 26:32.823
- No!

26:37.897 --> 26:39.029
- What'd I tell you, warden?

26:39.031 --> 26:42.633
The jungle's
getting its revenge!

26:46.839 --> 26:49.773
- I still think
we're releasing her too early.

26:49.775 --> 26:51.375
Look at how scared she is.

26:51.377 --> 26:53.110
- Nah. She's a fighter.

26:53.112 --> 26:55.846
- Just hope one of those crocs
doesn't snatch her up.

26:55.848 --> 26:58.182
- Whoa! You trying
to scare her or something?

26:58.184 --> 27:01.352
Look, Rosie is gonna
acclimate just fine.

27:04.223 --> 27:05.089
You okay?

27:05.091 --> 27:06.023
- Yeah, I'm good.

27:06.025 --> 27:08.392
- What the hell was that?

27:16.369 --> 27:17.167
- Oof.

27:17.169 --> 27:20.204
Poor bloke
didn't stand a chance.

27:20.339 --> 27:24.274
- It looked like it was dead
before we hit it.

27:24.343 --> 27:27.277
- Hey, let's get Rosie
out of the cage.

27:27.279 --> 27:28.112
- Yeah.

27:28.114 --> 27:32.149
- Sorry about my driving, Rosie,
but you're home now,

27:32.151 --> 27:36.186
and I bet the other hippos
can't wait to welcome you in.

27:36.722 --> 27:38.255
Speaking of which...

27:38.257 --> 27:41.025
- Where are the other hippos?

27:41.761 --> 27:44.094
Hmm. Okay, well,
there's definitely

27:44.096 --> 27:45.996
something not right
going on here.

27:45.998 --> 27:48.298
I mean, the virus,
it just keeps spreading,

27:48.300 --> 27:51.368
and the antibodies--

27:51.370 --> 27:53.037
Oh, wait.

27:54.840 --> 27:55.739
- What is it?

27:55.741 --> 27:57.341
- That woman is a monster.

27:57.343 --> 27:59.143
- Brooke,
don't do anything crazy.

27:59.145 --> 28:01.679
- She's gonna answer for this.

28:04.850 --> 28:06.250
- Oh.

28:08.054 --> 28:10.788
- Where did you
get noradrenaline?

28:10.923 --> 28:12.322
- I don't know
anybody by that name.

28:12.324 --> 28:15.192
- No wonder it took
ten ccs of tranquilizer

28:15.194 --> 28:16.260
to sedate that porcupine.

28:16.262 --> 28:19.129
You baked her brain
with liquid aggression.

28:19.131 --> 28:20.197
- What are you talking about?

28:20.199 --> 28:22.232
The toxin paralyzes them
from the inside out.

28:22.234 --> 28:24.835
If anything, it gave 'em a high
they'll never forget.

28:24.837 --> 28:27.171
- Did you see
how that porcupine was acting?

28:27.173 --> 28:30.908
Did it look like she was high
on mushrooms? You lunatic!

28:30.910 --> 28:33.243
- Well, maybe I made a mistake.
- A mistake?

28:33.245 --> 28:35.813
- Yeah.
It could happen to anybody.

28:35.815 --> 28:37.281
- You shoot up an animal
with toxic chemical,

28:37.283 --> 28:40.818
and all you can think to say
is that you made a mistake?

28:40.820 --> 28:43.120
- Like, who cares?
- I care!

28:43.122 --> 28:44.321
- And why?

28:44.323 --> 28:45.322
- What?

28:45.324 --> 28:46.423
- This planet is wasting away.

28:46.425 --> 28:50.761
I'm just trying to make some
cash before we're all extinct.

28:51.263 --> 28:53.263
Stop looking at me
like I'm a Judas.

28:53.265 --> 28:58.001
There's more people like me
out there than you anyway.

29:01.373 --> 29:04.374
- Hock to base. Come in.

29:05.845 --> 29:07.010
Whoever's there, pick up.

29:07.012 --> 29:09.813
Hock,
have you found any others?

29:09.815 --> 29:10.380
- Yeah,

29:10.382 --> 29:12.249
- and I'm afraid he was right.
- Right about what?

29:12.251 --> 29:15.219
Right about the animal attacks
or the poachers?

29:15.221 --> 29:17.221
- All of it.

29:18.190 --> 29:19.490
Brooke...

29:19.959 --> 29:21.859
Isaiah's dead.

29:30.102 --> 29:31.401
- How?

29:33.172 --> 29:34.404
- Aardvark attack.

29:34.406 --> 29:38.175
Aardvarks aren't aggressive.

29:39.311 --> 29:40.978
- Well, this one was.

29:40.980 --> 29:42.946
I don't know what's going on.

29:42.948 --> 29:44.782
- Oh, God. What about K.D.?

29:44.784 --> 29:46.917
- What about him?
- He and the others

29:46.919 --> 29:48.819
went to release
the baby hippo to the wild.

29:48.821 --> 29:51.321
Okay, if the animals are acting
crazy and they're out there--

29:51.323 --> 29:55.325
- Don't worry about K.D.
I need you to secure the base

29:55.327 --> 29:57.928
and keep an eye
on our two friends, okay?

29:57.930 --> 30:00.864
- I think I know
what's causing this.

30:00.866 --> 30:01.899
When will you be back?

30:01.901 --> 30:05.035
- Soon. We'll radio
as soon as we get eyes on K.D.

30:05.037 --> 30:08.338
Don't let any more animals
in the building.

30:10.309 --> 30:12.543
K.D., you there?

30:13.279 --> 30:17.915
Vet team, I need you to state
your last position. Over.

30:19.451 --> 30:23.554
We need to get to the river,
get eyes on K.D.

30:24.523 --> 30:26.056
- Hey, hey!

30:26.058 --> 30:28.225
Are you gonna take these off?

30:28.828 --> 30:30.093
What if the animals
attack again?

30:30.095 --> 30:32.062
How am I supposed
to defend myself?

30:32.064 --> 30:32.930
- You won't.

30:32.932 --> 30:35.232
- What am I supposed to do?

30:35.234 --> 30:38.001
- Run, fast.

30:38.904 --> 30:40.103
- Logan,
check on the porcupines.

30:40.105 --> 30:43.607
If the mama's awake,
sedate her and the babies.

30:43.609 --> 30:44.508
Then lock up the lab.

30:44.510 --> 30:47.444
For now, it's gonna be
our quarantine zone.

30:47.446 --> 30:48.245
- Quarantine?

30:48.247 --> 30:51.548
- There's a strong possibility
this affliction is contagious.

30:51.550 --> 30:54.184
Go to the lab now.
I'm gonna figure out

30:54.186 --> 30:57.287
what started this
in the first place.

31:10.636 --> 31:12.469
How do I get this dart out?

31:12.471 --> 31:13.971
- Screw you.

31:15.074 --> 31:16.506
- Fine.

31:16.508 --> 31:18.275
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

31:18.277 --> 31:22.346
- I'll get it out this way.
- Whoa! Whoa!

31:23.115 --> 31:24.047
Chill!

31:24.049 --> 31:25.082
- Okay, you just...

31:25.084 --> 31:29.152
push the latch toward you
to-- to the back.

31:31.657 --> 31:32.623
- Thanks.

31:32.625 --> 31:36.460
Now who's gonna tell me
what this is made out of?

31:37.196 --> 31:40.197
Are we gonna do that
the hard way, too?

32:00.119 --> 32:02.519
- Oh, shit.

32:15.601 --> 32:19.303
Here, porky, porky, porky.

32:19.305 --> 32:21.638
Here, porky.

32:22.274 --> 32:24.074
Where you at?

32:24.209 --> 32:28.145
Logan's got
something tasty for you.

32:29.581 --> 32:31.515
Where you at?

32:35.387 --> 32:36.720
Okay.

32:37.323 --> 32:39.556
Want to dance?

32:40.526 --> 32:42.459
Bring it.

32:46.598 --> 32:49.399
Logan?!

32:49.401 --> 32:51.234
Logan?

32:54.573 --> 32:56.006
Logan?

34:46.452 --> 34:48.185
Ahh!

35:00.332 --> 35:03.300
- Get off of me!

35:14.580 --> 35:17.180
- You're a bad mama.

35:57.623 --> 36:00.724
- Get--Get it off!
Get it off her face!

36:04.229 --> 36:05.929
- You need something thick,

36:05.931 --> 36:08.231
like a-- a glove, yeah!

36:17.309 --> 36:18.441
Pull it off of her! She's dying!

36:18.443 --> 36:22.846
I--It's on too tight!

36:42.201 --> 36:44.234
Oh, my God.

36:46.738 --> 36:47.871
- What?! What?!

36:47.873 --> 36:49.639
- Your shoulder!

36:56.348 --> 36:58.515
- Hock to K.D.! Are you there?

36:58.517 --> 37:00.283
- They're probably already dead.

37:00.285 --> 37:03.253
- Is anybody talking to you?

37:03.755 --> 37:07.557
- Face it, warden. We're not
the kings of the jungle anymore!

37:07.559 --> 37:09.526
- Vet team, do you read?

37:11.630 --> 37:13.730
En route to your
assumed location by the river.

37:13.732 --> 37:16.900
Can you confirm
you're there? Over.

37:25.344 --> 37:26.810
- Looks like the mothers
are taking to her.

37:26.812 --> 37:30.013
- Let's just hope
the bulls take to her as well.

37:34.786 --> 37:36.453
That's odd.

37:37.623 --> 37:41.791
- Yeah. Nothing should be
herding around this time of day.

37:51.937 --> 37:53.770
Run!

37:53.772 --> 37:55.839
Oh, my God!

37:56.875 --> 37:58.475
It's a stampede!

37:58.477 --> 38:00.410
Oh, my God!

38:01.713 --> 38:03.713
Dear Lord,
I come to you in fear.

38:03.715 --> 38:06.049
- Less talk! More running!

38:09.021 --> 38:12.355
- Go! Go, go, go! Ahh!

38:12.724 --> 38:14.057
- Need a ride?

38:14.059 --> 38:14.958
- Get in, now!

38:14.960 --> 38:16.926
- Oh, thank you, Jesus!
- All right, guys.

38:16.928 --> 38:18.695
Wait.
What just happened?

38:18.697 --> 38:20.997
- Go, go, go, go, go! Come on!
- Go! Go!

38:20.999 --> 38:22.732
- I'm trying!
- Come on!

38:22.734 --> 38:25.402
- Something's wrong.
I think it's flooded.

38:25.404 --> 38:25.835
- Go!

38:25.837 --> 38:28.371
- Yeah, well,
you better figure it out now!

38:28.373 --> 38:29.406
- K.D., what do I do?!

38:29.408 --> 38:31.041
- Push the pedal,
and press the button!

38:31.043 --> 38:32.876
Then push the button!
Push the button!

38:32.878 --> 38:35.979
- Got it!
Why didn't you just say so?

38:39.318 --> 38:40.016
- Go!
- Got it!

38:40.018 --> 38:41.685
- Come on, man!
- Go!

38:41.687 --> 38:44.020
Whoa!

38:44.022 --> 38:46.389
- Ford!

38:46.925 --> 38:48.425
- W-Wait!

38:49.728 --> 38:51.828
- We gotta shoot these bastards!

38:51.830 --> 38:52.962
- Huh?

38:52.964 --> 38:55.031
Oh, God!

39:04.543 --> 39:08.645
- Your little BB gun
isn't gonna hurt these things!

39:09.715 --> 39:11.548
Uncuff me!

39:12.417 --> 39:13.950
Do you want everyone to die?

39:13.952 --> 39:15.485
- Take his cuffs off!

39:15.487 --> 39:18.621
- What? You're gonna uncuff him?

39:20.692 --> 39:21.825
- You're gonna thank me.

39:21.827 --> 39:23.893
- And you're
gonna give him a gun?

39:23.895 --> 39:26.863
You're gonna
give a bad guy a gun!

39:30.535 --> 39:32.569
- Die!

39:32.571 --> 39:35.071
- They're gonna hit us!
They're gonna hit us!

39:35.073 --> 39:37.640
You gotta go fast! Go!

39:42.748 --> 39:43.780
- To the right! To the right!

39:43.782 --> 39:46.683
- Hey, man,
tell him to get-- get away!

39:50.889 --> 39:53.022
Drive the other way!

39:55.060 --> 39:57.961
- Why won't you die?

40:02.167 --> 40:03.700
- Get down!

40:04.536 --> 40:07.437
No, no, no, no, no! No!

40:19.451 --> 40:22.452
- Hey, girl, are you okay?

40:22.854 --> 40:24.854
Are you dying, too?

40:24.856 --> 40:25.822
Because if you are,

40:25.824 --> 40:29.125
I really don't wanna starve
to death in this room...

40:29.995 --> 40:31.828
with this dead body!

40:34.466 --> 40:36.733
- Come on!
I wouldn't leave you to die

40:36.735 --> 40:40.470
next to your dead friend
on the floor. Come on!

40:40.472 --> 40:41.738
- Shut up!

40:42.641 --> 40:45.809
- Come on, lady! Help me!

40:51.183 --> 40:54.184
- Randy? Are you there?
It's Brooke.

40:54.186 --> 40:56.219
Randy, answer me!

40:56.221 --> 40:59.722
K.D., are you there? Hello?

41:00.091 --> 41:02.859
Is anyone out there?

41:02.861 --> 41:06.496
Is anyone out there? Please!

41:11.002 --> 41:12.869
I'm all alone.

41:19.478 --> 41:24.047
What guarantee do I have if I
let you out, you don't hurt me?

41:24.683 --> 41:26.916
- My main concern is
the porcupine had rabies,

41:26.918 --> 41:30.019
so we need to disinfect
your wound immediately.

41:30.021 --> 41:33.089
Do you have any rabies
immunoglobulin on hand?

41:33.091 --> 41:35.091
- Of course.

41:36.695 --> 41:39.128
- Good. We need
to get you a shot

41:39.130 --> 41:41.130
before it compromises
your immune system.

41:41.132 --> 41:43.500
- How do you know all this?

41:43.869 --> 41:45.034
- I'm more than just good looks

41:45.036 --> 41:46.603
and killer tattoos.

41:46.605 --> 41:49.038
- I also think
I know how to fix this.

41:49.040 --> 41:50.273
- How?
- The toxin,

41:50.275 --> 41:53.943
it's obviously what's
driving these animals crazy.

41:53.945 --> 41:57.113
I created it,
so I can counteract it.

41:57.849 --> 42:00.984
But I can't do it
while I'm locked up.

42:17.168 --> 42:20.603
I'm also concerned
about your quill wounds.

42:20.805 --> 42:23.873
- I know. I was just about
to take a blood sample of it

42:23.875 --> 42:27.043
to see if the toxin
you shot that porcupine up with

42:27.045 --> 42:28.044
got in my system, too.

42:28.046 --> 42:30.179
- Even if it did, you're immune.

42:30.181 --> 42:31.948
- You don't know that.

42:31.950 --> 42:32.982
- I made sure the toxin

42:32.984 --> 42:36.586
didn't kill people
when I created it.

42:37.155 --> 42:39.689
I'm not completely evil.

43:04.583 --> 43:06.282
What the...

43:12.190 --> 43:13.890
- Easy.

43:13.892 --> 43:15.825
K.D., he's awake!

43:18.296 --> 43:19.195
What happened?

43:19.197 --> 43:21.197
- You got thrown from the jeep
when we crashed.

43:21.199 --> 43:22.999
I thought you might take it
the wrong way

43:23.001 --> 43:27.136
if I slapped you awake, so I
used a little water instead.

43:30.809 --> 43:32.609
- Where's Mike?

43:32.611 --> 43:35.111
The other ranger.

43:35.380 --> 43:39.182
- I didn't, uh, want to leave
his body out in the rain,

43:39.184 --> 43:43.019
so I found a blanket
in the jeep.

43:43.154 --> 43:48.157
Also, I found your gun
and some ammo.

43:50.895 --> 43:51.694
- You stayed?

43:51.696 --> 43:55.832
- Don't know where
the hell else I would go.

43:58.169 --> 44:00.336
Besides...

44:02.707 --> 44:03.640
- where are we?

44:03.642 --> 44:07.076
Out by the western border.

44:08.847 --> 44:09.712
- Close to base?

44:09.714 --> 44:12.982
- About a mile and a half,
maybe two.

44:12.984 --> 44:14.684
- So walking distance.

44:14.686 --> 44:16.019
- Yeah.
- What?!

44:16.021 --> 44:17.854
Are you crazy?
You want us to walk?

44:17.856 --> 44:20.957
Who knows what else is out there
waiting to rip us in half?

44:20.959 --> 44:22.425
- It's fine. We'll radio Brooke.

44:22.427 --> 44:24.994
We'll get her to come
pick us up in the SUV.

44:24.996 --> 44:28.431
- No. Radio's smashed.
I checked.

44:30.068 --> 44:33.302
- Okay. Grab what you can.

44:33.872 --> 44:35.071
- So--So you want us

44:35.073 --> 44:37.707
to go on a nature hike
right now?

44:37.709 --> 44:40.376
- Look, if we stay calm,
move quietly,

44:40.378 --> 44:41.711
I think we'll be okay.

44:41.713 --> 44:43.680
- No! Th-This is not going on!

44:43.682 --> 44:45.815
This-- This is not supposed
to be happening!

44:45.817 --> 44:48.351
It was just a few hours ago,
I just woke up!

44:48.353 --> 44:51.354
I had plans.
I was supposed to get on the--

44:51.356 --> 44:52.722
uh, a bike.

44:52.724 --> 44:56.092
I was supposed
to go see the-- the zebras.

44:56.094 --> 44:57.460
- I want you
to stay with me, K.D.!

44:57.462 --> 45:00.263
- I did not sign up for this!
- Yes, you did!

45:00.265 --> 45:02.699
Took an oath to protect
the animals, remember?

45:02.701 --> 45:03.900
- But who is gonna protect us?

45:03.902 --> 45:06.235
- You need to hold it
together, man.

45:06.237 --> 45:08.371
- Oh! You!

45:08.373 --> 45:10.206
You are gonna
tell me what to do?!

45:10.208 --> 45:12.041
If it wasn't for you,
we wouldn't even

45:12.043 --> 45:14.143
be in this mess
in the first place!

45:14.145 --> 45:15.478
K.D.!

45:15.480 --> 45:16.846
Stop!

45:16.848 --> 45:18.347
- No, it's okay. Let him go.

45:18.349 --> 45:19.849
Come on. I deserve it.

45:19.851 --> 45:22.051
Come on. Take a shot.

45:22.954 --> 45:25.722
- Snap out of it, K.D.!

45:25.724 --> 45:28.357
We need your help right now.

45:29.394 --> 45:34.464
Look, you know this area
better than everyone, right?

45:35.100 --> 45:36.833
- Of course I do.

45:36.835 --> 45:39.135
My dad designed it.

45:39.804 --> 45:40.737
- Okay.

45:40.739 --> 45:43.906
What's the best way
for us to get out of here?

45:51.149 --> 45:53.015
- Through that gulch.

45:54.986 --> 45:57.520
That'll take us back to base.

45:58.389 --> 46:00.423
It'll be muddy...

46:01.025 --> 46:03.226
with lots of bugs...

46:04.162 --> 46:06.295
but we can make it.

46:06.297 --> 46:07.797
- Then let's move.

46:07.799 --> 46:10.466
I don't wanna be
out here after dark.

46:10.769 --> 46:14.370
God only knows
what's gonna come after us then.

46:14.939 --> 46:18.074
- Listen, Ms. Sullivan,
I need you to calm down.

46:18.076 --> 46:19.175
- No! You listen to me!

46:19.177 --> 46:20.910
- I've alerted
the enforcement agents

46:20.912 --> 46:23.379
that are already
en route to your situation,

46:23.381 --> 46:25.047
and they're
still being scheduled

46:25.049 --> 46:26.082
to arrive before sundown.

46:26.084 --> 46:29.218
The medical and coroner teams
are still being assembled.

46:29.220 --> 46:32.388
- It's still being assembled?
What in the world is the holdup?

46:32.390 --> 46:35.124
- Dr. Sullivan, the continuing
changes in the weather

46:35.126 --> 46:36.993
and your remote location
provide challenges

46:36.995 --> 46:39.128
in getting to you
as quickly as we'd like.

46:39.130 --> 46:40.963
We're using
all available resources

46:40.965 --> 46:42.965
and personnel
we have at our disposal.

46:42.967 --> 46:44.100
You are not alone in this.

46:44.102 --> 46:45.835
- Well, it sure feels
like I'm alone.

46:45.837 --> 46:48.004
Is there anyone
that can get here faster?

46:48.006 --> 46:50.006
- Be assured
we're doing our best.

46:50.008 --> 46:53.009
- Well, if this is your best,
then your best sucks.

46:53.011 --> 46:54.377
Ms. Sulliv--

46:54.379 --> 46:56.112
God!

47:01.419 --> 47:03.119
- Get the hell away from me!

47:03.121 --> 47:05.254
- Sorry! I slipped!
- You two cut it out.

47:05.256 --> 47:07.590
- Yeah, well, keep him
the hell away from me.

47:07.592 --> 47:09.091
- I said I'm sorry.

47:09.093 --> 47:10.359
- Oh, okay, you're sorry.

47:10.361 --> 47:11.961
What, is that
all you have to say

47:11.963 --> 47:14.163
to the mothers of those
baby elephants you killed?

47:14.165 --> 47:15.598
What about
those monkeys you steal

47:15.600 --> 47:18.201
and sell to some debutantes
in Paris?

47:18.203 --> 47:19.502
- Quiet.

47:19.504 --> 47:21.070
- Whoa.

47:24.275 --> 47:26.008
- Where are we?

47:27.979 --> 47:30.913
- We're in the middle
of a game trail.

47:31.015 --> 47:32.849
- A game trail?
- Yeah.

47:32.851 --> 47:33.850
You know, a game trail,

47:33.852 --> 47:36.619
sort of like what you
turned this whole refuge into!

47:36.621 --> 47:39.222
- Would you two knock it off?

47:40.525 --> 47:44.927
Looks like the animals are
starting to feed off each other.

47:51.269 --> 47:54.303
- We need to find a detour.

47:54.305 --> 47:55.404
- But this is the quickest way.

47:55.406 --> 47:58.608
- To what? Being pooped out
of whatever animal did this?

47:58.610 --> 48:00.076
I don't think so.

48:00.078 --> 48:02.378
- Toronto's right.

48:02.380 --> 48:04.213
We need to get out in the open.

48:04.215 --> 48:05.648
Hopefully then
we'll have a chance

48:05.650 --> 48:07.350
to see the animals
before they see us.

48:07.352 --> 48:09.352
- Yeah, but we
can't get back to base

48:09.354 --> 48:10.419
unless we cross the bridge,

48:10.421 --> 48:11.921
and the bridge
is right over this hill.

48:11.923 --> 48:15.057
- Maybe we
don't cross the bridge.

48:15.059 --> 48:17.260
Maybe we go under it.

48:30.208 --> 48:32.208
- Your microscope
needs an upgrade.

48:32.210 --> 48:34.477
- I put in a grant
for a new one.

48:34.479 --> 48:38.981
- Well, we had
the same problem at Princeton.

48:38.983 --> 48:40.249
Can you believe that?

48:40.251 --> 48:41.651
One of the top
Ivy League schools,

48:41.653 --> 48:44.186
and we still had
cruddy lab stations.

48:44.188 --> 48:45.988
- You went to Princeton?

48:45.990 --> 48:48.090
- And Yale.

48:48.293 --> 48:50.993
It's not so polite
to act so surprised.

48:50.995 --> 48:53.462
- Well, I just didn't
think somebody who's--

48:53.464 --> 48:54.964
- Like me?

48:56.067 --> 49:01.470
Would blow every chance she had
up her nose or veins?

49:02.307 --> 49:05.541
Being an addict
and a whiz in chemistry

49:05.543 --> 49:08.144
is a bad combination.

49:10.415 --> 49:12.048
Did you make any contact?

49:12.050 --> 49:14.116
- The chopper
that was dispatched earlier

49:14.118 --> 49:15.651
is still three hours away.

49:15.653 --> 49:17.320
Told them
we'd need a medical team,

49:17.322 --> 49:19.055
and that's gonna take
even longer.

49:19.057 --> 49:20.356
Whoa.

49:20.358 --> 49:21.524
- Here. Let me help.
- No, no, no.

49:21.526 --> 49:24.260
I got it.

49:24.262 --> 49:25.661
- Whoa, careful.

49:25.663 --> 49:27.229
Spike's in there.

49:27.231 --> 49:28.130
- Spike?

49:28.132 --> 49:30.232
- Yeah. While you
were on the radio,

49:30.234 --> 49:32.368
I put the baby porcupine
in that box.

49:32.370 --> 49:36.639
We're gonna need him
to test the antidote on,

49:36.641 --> 49:38.607
which we can do...

49:38.609 --> 49:44.280
now that I've successfully
reversed the toxin.

49:44.282 --> 49:46.716
- You reversed it
that quickly? I--

49:46.718 --> 49:48.117
That sounds way too easy.

49:48.119 --> 49:49.652
- Oh, it was a bitch, trust me.

49:49.654 --> 49:50.720
Luckily, I had the proteins

49:50.722 --> 49:52.388
necessary to enable
the reaction.

49:52.390 --> 49:54.724
- Where?
Surely this little vet clinic

49:54.726 --> 49:58.461
didn't have all the chemicals
and compounds you would need.

49:58.463 --> 50:00.062
- No...

50:00.064 --> 50:01.597
but I do...

50:03.201 --> 50:04.433
and so do you.

50:04.435 --> 50:10.106
The enzymes necessary to reverse
the toxin is human blood.

50:10.408 --> 50:12.641
Told you I was smart.

50:13.544 --> 50:14.610
- I'm impressed.

50:14.612 --> 50:17.213
- Ah, it was nothing.

50:18.216 --> 50:20.316
- Just one question for you.

50:20.318 --> 50:21.050
- Shoot.

50:21.052 --> 50:24.153
- Why are you wasting your life
capturing exotic animals?

50:26.190 --> 50:27.256
Hey, hey, hey!

50:27.258 --> 50:28.124
Calm down in there!

50:28.126 --> 50:31.794
You don't want me to hurt you
like I did last time.

50:32.563 --> 50:35.531
You okay?

50:35.533 --> 50:37.400
- He's okay.

50:37.402 --> 50:39.602
What about you? Any symptoms?

50:39.604 --> 50:42.171
- Uh, no fever,

50:42.173 --> 50:43.072
a little nauseous.

50:43.074 --> 50:47.076
- Yeah, but you've been nauseous
before today, right?

50:47.078 --> 50:49.245
At least two weeks

50:49.247 --> 50:50.346
- How do you know that?

50:50.348 --> 50:53.049
- Your blood sample
gave it away.

50:53.051 --> 50:54.116
- Gave what away?

50:54.118 --> 50:56.652
- You really don't know?

50:58.389 --> 51:00.623
- I'm pregnant, aren't I?

51:04.295 --> 51:05.494
- Okay, but if I'm infected

51:05.496 --> 51:07.196
and then the virus
starts to attack--

51:07.198 --> 51:09.398
- Humans are immune
to the toxin.

51:09.400 --> 51:10.699
- You don't know that.

51:10.701 --> 51:12.601
- I created it that way.

51:12.603 --> 51:17.139
The virus can't attack proteins
in human blood.

51:17.141 --> 51:18.140
It was my way of ensuring

51:18.142 --> 51:19.442
the poachers
wouldn't kill themselves

51:19.444 --> 51:21.210
while they're
in the jungle with it.

51:21.212 --> 51:22.611
They're lousy shots.

51:22.613 --> 51:24.213
- Jezel, if you're so smart,

51:24.215 --> 51:25.781
why are you wasting
your life doing this?

51:25.783 --> 51:29.251
- Maybe I'm not as smart
as you think I am.

51:29.253 --> 51:32.822
- No, why do you hunt
and capture the animals?

51:37.628 --> 51:40.863
When you hurt like I hurt...

51:41.199 --> 51:44.100
sometimes the only thing
that'll make you feel better

51:44.102 --> 51:46.602
is hurting something back.

51:47.738 --> 51:51.507
- Guess they
have the last laugh now, huh?

51:51.509 --> 51:54.844
Payback is such a bitch.

51:55.847 --> 51:59.849
- If you started this,
then you can finish it, too.

52:01.152 --> 52:03.185
- Let's hope so.

52:15.666 --> 52:17.333
- We gotta go get him.

52:17.335 --> 52:18.701
- Right.

52:18.703 --> 52:20.836
- You first.
- You first.

52:30.515 --> 52:32.848
- I think this is
where we'll need to cross.

52:32.850 --> 52:34.350
Oh, hell, no! No!

52:34.352 --> 52:36.519
You don't even know
what's in that water!

52:36.521 --> 52:39.455
- We need to get
to the other side of the river.

52:39.457 --> 52:40.756
- No! Absolutely not!

52:40.758 --> 52:43.325
- Dude, just get your whiny butt
in the water.

52:43.327 --> 52:44.627
- Toronto...
- No, who you calling wimpy?

52:44.629 --> 52:46.228
- No, listen.
I'm talking about you.

52:46.230 --> 52:47.763
You been complaining
this entire time.

52:47.765 --> 52:49.398
- No, you--
- Toronto!

52:49.400 --> 52:50.499
- What?!
- What?!

52:50.501 --> 52:52.568
- Just stand very still.

52:55.506 --> 52:57.540
There's something behind me,
isn't there?

52:57.542 --> 53:00.342
- I'm gonna count to three...
- Aww...

53:00.344 --> 53:04.413
and then you move, okay?

53:04.415 --> 53:05.714
One...

53:05.917 --> 53:09.185
Move!

53:21.799 --> 53:23.232
What?

53:27.205 --> 53:29.371
- I think
I owe you one for that.

53:29.373 --> 53:31.607
- I'll put it on your tab.

53:32.543 --> 53:33.676
We might need to go back.

53:33.678 --> 53:37.479
- No! We're not
going back in there!

53:37.481 --> 53:39.215
And we not getting in the water!

53:39.217 --> 53:39.982
- K.D., I like you,

53:39.984 --> 53:43.652
but I need you
to shut up so I can think.

53:46.390 --> 53:48.757
Are we near the hippo dock?

53:50.261 --> 53:50.759
K.D.?

53:50.761 --> 53:54.463
- Oh, I thought
you wanted me to shut up.

53:54.465 --> 53:55.931
- Oh, my God.

53:55.933 --> 53:58.801
- Yes. Yes,
we're about the Hippo Dock.

53:58.803 --> 54:02.538
- Good.
'Cause if I remember correctly,

54:02.540 --> 54:04.506
it should be over here.

54:04.508 --> 54:07.276
- What? What should be where?

54:16.988 --> 54:18.988
- Transportation.

54:33.704 --> 54:34.970
- Sorry.

54:40.911 --> 54:41.877
I don't like this.

54:41.879 --> 54:43.712
We're supposed to be
counteracting the toxin,

54:43.714 --> 54:44.980
not shooting
more animals with it.

54:44.982 --> 54:46.482
- We don't have to use
the toxin.

54:46.484 --> 54:49.318
We can load it
with whatever we want.

54:49.453 --> 54:51.920
- Stay there,
and watch the door.

55:06.404 --> 55:08.737
I don't think it's in here.

55:15.746 --> 55:17.479
- Well, there went
our test subject.

55:17.481 --> 55:20.783
- We're gonna have to find
another animal that's infected.

55:20.785 --> 55:21.984
- Just like that?

55:21.986 --> 55:23.652
- What's the problem?

55:23.654 --> 55:24.486
- The problem?

55:24.488 --> 55:27.022
You've seen how the porcupine
acts on that disease.

55:27.024 --> 55:29.725
Can you even imagine
a bigger animal, like a tiger?

55:29.727 --> 55:33.796
- Exactly. That's why we need to
stop this as soon as possible.

55:33.798 --> 55:36.965
- What? So we just go outside,
find another wild animal

55:36.967 --> 55:39.368
that's crazed
and wants to kill us?

55:39.370 --> 55:40.703
- Yeah.

55:40.838 --> 55:43.706
- And what if we don't find one?

55:46.544 --> 55:48.777
Then we'll make one.

56:10.368 --> 56:12.835
- Come on, guys.
Wait up.

56:16.841 --> 56:18.841
- You know, I get it now.

56:18.843 --> 56:20.776
- What's that?

56:20.778 --> 56:24.480
- I get why you work so hard
to protect this place.

56:24.482 --> 56:25.547
- Oh, yeah?

56:25.549 --> 56:27.049
- It really is paradise.

56:27.051 --> 56:29.852
- Well, we wouldn't have to work
so hard to protect it

56:29.854 --> 56:31.086
if it weren't
for people like you.

56:31.088 --> 56:34.523
- Yeah, that's why I think
I should work for you.

56:35.926 --> 56:37.593
Why would I hire you?

56:37.595 --> 56:39.061
- Eh, you saved my life.

56:39.063 --> 56:40.462
You must see
something good in me.

56:40.464 --> 56:43.766
- He didn't save your life
'cause he likes you.

56:43.768 --> 56:45.033
He saved it 'cause--

56:45.035 --> 56:45.968
I don't know.

56:45.970 --> 56:47.903
Shh!

56:49.774 --> 56:52.508
- It's not another snake, is it?

56:52.943 --> 56:54.676
- I don't know.

56:54.678 --> 56:56.812
I thought I felt something...

56:59.650 --> 57:01.650
something really big.

57:02.186 --> 57:04.720
It's not much further. Come on.

57:25.176 --> 57:26.074
Damn it.

57:26.076 --> 57:28.544
Where's a bloodthirsty animal
when you need one?

57:28.546 --> 57:29.678
- I don't like this, okay?

57:29.680 --> 57:32.481
We're supposed to be curing
the animals, not infecting more.

57:32.483 --> 57:34.817
- If the cure works,
it will reverse the infection,

57:34.819 --> 57:37.186
but we won't know
until we try it first.

57:37.188 --> 57:39.721
- We should go back and wait
for the chopper, wait for help.

57:39.723 --> 57:42.891
- Do you know how many more
animals could turn before then?

57:42.893 --> 57:45.093
- Okay, we're not equipped
to handle this.

57:45.095 --> 57:48.163
Shh.

57:51.202 --> 57:52.201
- Are you insane?

57:52.203 --> 57:55.838
A crocodile is dangerous enough
without the toxin in its system.

57:55.840 --> 57:57.539
- Do you see any better options?

57:57.541 --> 57:59.942
This isn't exactly
a petting zoo.

57:59.944 --> 58:02.177
- Let's keep looking.

58:02.613 --> 58:04.813
- Okay, fine.

58:04.815 --> 58:06.582
- Good.

58:06.851 --> 58:09.485
Psyche.

58:14.024 --> 58:14.790
- Wait.

58:14.792 --> 58:17.125
- We need to see if it works.

58:18.095 --> 58:19.661
- Are you crazy?

58:19.663 --> 58:20.796
Don't get so close.

58:20.798 --> 58:22.898
- It's changing...

58:22.900 --> 58:24.733
fast.

58:24.735 --> 58:25.868
- Amphibians are coldblooded.

58:25.870 --> 58:28.003
Makes sense that they
would process the toxin

58:28.005 --> 58:30.105
differently than mammals would.

58:33.077 --> 58:35.677
- Give me the antidote!

58:36.213 --> 58:38.647
Give me the antidote!

58:41.585 --> 58:42.918
Ohh!

58:42.920 --> 58:43.852
I missed.

58:43.854 --> 58:46.021
- No!
- No!

58:57.968 --> 58:59.034
What?

58:59.036 --> 59:02.905
- Thanks for being a lousy shot.

59:09.914 --> 59:10.679
- Is it dead?

59:10.681 --> 59:13.582
- Looks like it's
in a sort of unconscious state,

59:13.584 --> 59:15.651
maybe a coma.

59:16.153 --> 59:18.253
- It's changing back.

59:19.290 --> 59:20.289
It's really working.

59:20.291 --> 59:22.691
It's working.

59:22.693 --> 59:25.027
I actually did something right!

59:25.029 --> 59:28.230
- Quick, let's replicate this.
Come on.

59:38.208 --> 59:40.909
- Looks like
the weather's clearing up.

59:40.911 --> 59:41.843
- Yo, I'm tired.

59:41.845 --> 59:45.314
- I know, but we gotta
keep moving, K.D. Keep going.

59:45.316 --> 59:46.148
- Oh, come on.

59:46.150 --> 59:47.683
Let the little wimp
take a break.

59:47.685 --> 59:50.619
- Yo, shut up! And why did I
get the little boat, huh?

59:50.621 --> 59:51.787
This thing don't even feel safe!

59:51.789 --> 59:56.358
- That's good! Use that energy,
and paddle that little boat!

59:58.629 --> 01:00:00.829
- Don't make me laugh.
- Why not?

01:00:00.831 --> 01:00:02.097
- 'Cause I don't like you.

01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:03.665
- Oh, all my friends hate me.

01:00:03.667 --> 01:00:04.800
We'll get along great.

01:00:04.802 --> 01:00:06.868
- Ah, great. The poacher
wants to make friends

01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:11.073
while we're at a zoo,
surrounded by zombie animals.

01:00:12.643 --> 01:00:14.743
- Like zoombies.

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:17.813
There's the lab.

01:00:17.815 --> 01:00:19.648
Put your back into it, guys.

01:00:22.019 --> 01:00:23.318
- What the...

01:00:28.092 --> 01:00:29.791
Where'd it go?

01:00:41.305 --> 01:00:44.039
Ohh!

01:00:44.041 --> 01:00:44.773
- K.D.!

01:00:44.775 --> 01:00:47.175
- No! This ain't fair!

01:00:47.311 --> 01:00:50.112
I've spent my whole life
taking care of these animals!

01:00:50.114 --> 01:00:51.647
I don't deserve this!

01:00:51.649 --> 01:00:54.816
I saved you! I saved you!

01:00:54.818 --> 01:00:55.917
I saved you!

01:00:55.919 --> 01:00:58.754
No!

01:00:59.690 --> 01:01:01.289
- That's a first.

01:01:10.434 --> 01:01:12.734
- It's coming back!

01:01:14.138 --> 01:01:16.304
It's coming back!

01:01:28.786 --> 01:01:30.052
- Toronto!

01:01:30.054 --> 01:01:31.887
Toronto!

01:01:31.889 --> 01:01:33.155
Toronto!

01:01:37.928 --> 01:01:39.194
Come on!

01:01:55.479 --> 01:01:57.813
- Guess that makes us even.

01:01:57.815 --> 01:01:59.414
- Don't mention it.

01:02:10.394 --> 01:02:12.861
- Randy!
- Brooke.

01:02:15.866 --> 01:02:17.299
- I thought I lost you.

01:02:17.301 --> 01:02:18.433
You didn't answer the radio.

01:02:18.435 --> 01:02:21.803
- Sorry. The radios
got trapped wh--

01:02:25.209 --> 01:02:27.275
I didn't think
you'd miss me so much.

01:02:27.277 --> 01:02:30.412
- Everything's changed

01:02:30.414 --> 01:02:31.413
I've changed.

01:02:31.415 --> 01:02:33.849
We've changed.

01:02:34.251 --> 01:02:36.051
It's all changed.

01:02:36.053 --> 01:02:37.219
- Yeah.

01:02:37.221 --> 01:02:40.489
- Toronto, please,
give me a break.

01:02:40.491 --> 01:02:43.024
- She hasn't changed.

01:02:44.428 --> 01:02:45.460
- We found a cure.

01:02:45.462 --> 01:02:47.763
- Cure? This fast?

01:02:47.765 --> 01:02:50.198
- Yeah. The key is human blood.

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:51.233
- We're immune to it.

01:02:51.235 --> 01:02:53.235
- So if we combine our blood
with the original toxin--

01:02:53.237 --> 01:02:56.104
- We can reverse
the change in the animals.

01:02:56.106 --> 01:02:57.506
We can save them.

01:02:57.508 --> 01:02:58.840
- Wait.

01:02:58.842 --> 01:03:02.010
I feel like there's something
you guys aren't telling me.

01:03:02.012 --> 01:03:04.079
- I found out a lot today.

01:03:04.081 --> 01:03:05.480
- Like what?

01:03:06.817 --> 01:03:08.283
- If I tell you,

01:03:08.285 --> 01:03:11.920
it'll change
everything between us.

01:03:12.022 --> 01:03:14.322
I'm...

01:03:14.324 --> 01:03:16.458
It didn't work!

01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:18.794
Move!

01:03:18.929 --> 01:03:21.496
- Let's go!
- Come on!

01:03:23.867 --> 01:03:26.034
- Grab something
to barricade the entrance!

01:03:26.036 --> 01:03:27.369
- Got it!

01:03:32.509 --> 01:03:33.842
- Why didn't the antidote work?

01:03:33.844 --> 01:03:36.478
- The toxin's too strong.
You can't reverse it.

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:38.947
- Something must have
compromised the serum.

01:03:38.949 --> 01:03:42.517
Outside air? Metal properties
when we put it in the dart?

01:03:42.519 --> 01:03:44.119
God, I don't know.

01:03:44.121 --> 01:03:45.320
- We'll worry about that later.

01:03:45.322 --> 01:03:47.255
Right now, we need
to barricade this door.

01:03:47.257 --> 01:03:48.323
- Brooke, what are you doing?

01:03:48.325 --> 01:03:50.525
- It's fine!
- No, this is too heavy!

01:03:50.527 --> 01:03:52.928
You could hurt your baby!

01:03:53.597 --> 01:03:55.363
- Baby?

01:03:57.968 --> 01:03:58.934
You're pregnant?

01:03:58.936 --> 01:04:01.369
- I just found out.

01:04:01.371 --> 01:04:03.238
- I guess we know
who the daddy is.

01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:05.173
- I don't know what to say.

01:04:05.175 --> 01:04:07.242
- Congratulations.

01:04:15.185 --> 01:04:17.919
- Something's in the pipes.

01:04:19.122 --> 01:04:20.488
- Wait here.

01:05:18.315 --> 01:05:21.016
You gotta be kidding me.

01:05:30.494 --> 01:05:32.093
- It's in the building!

01:05:41.204 --> 01:05:42.570
- Do you got
any more bullets left?

01:05:42.572 --> 01:05:44.506
It's useless.

01:05:44.508 --> 01:05:46.274
Bounced right off it
like Tic Tacs.

01:05:46.276 --> 01:05:48.310
- I know
why the cure didn't work.

01:05:48.312 --> 01:05:49.177
- Not now, Jezel.

01:05:49.179 --> 01:05:50.211
- If we can't kill it,

01:05:50.213 --> 01:05:51.413
then we're gonna
have to trap it.

01:05:51.415 --> 01:05:53.415
- The cure will only work
in human blood.

01:05:53.417 --> 01:05:55.417
I thought I could make
a synthetic substitute,

01:05:55.419 --> 01:05:57.719
but it won't work
outside of our systems,

01:05:57.721 --> 01:06:00.455
not in a dart, not in a syringe.

01:06:00.457 --> 01:06:02.324
- Just be quiet, you two.

01:06:02.326 --> 01:06:04.125
There's a freezer
in the kitchen.

01:06:04.127 --> 01:06:05.427
Maybe we can lure it in there.

01:06:05.429 --> 01:06:08.096
- Give me the cure
so I can put in me.

01:06:08.098 --> 01:06:10.131
- No, no.
- Are you crazy? No.

01:06:10.133 --> 01:06:13.335
- We are the missing ingredient.

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:15.737
Maybe that's
why they're attacking us,

01:06:15.739 --> 01:06:16.604
not out of violence,

01:06:16.606 --> 01:06:19.140
but out of the instinctive hope
that they can be cured.

01:06:19.142 --> 01:06:23.144
- Okay, even if that is true,
I don't have another dart.

01:06:23.146 --> 01:06:24.279
- The serum's in the lab.

01:06:24.281 --> 01:06:28.416
- If I put the cure in me,
I can save all of us!

01:06:29.152 --> 01:06:30.251
- Jezel!

01:06:31.088 --> 01:06:33.355
Jezel!

01:06:33.357 --> 01:06:34.589
- No!

01:06:42.332 --> 01:06:44.165
- Jezel!

01:06:44.167 --> 01:06:46.167
No!

01:06:53.043 --> 01:06:53.541
No!

01:06:53.543 --> 01:06:56.611
Randy! Randy!

01:06:56.613 --> 01:06:59.114
Randy! Randy, it's dead!

01:06:59.116 --> 01:07:00.515
- No, no.

01:07:00.517 --> 01:07:03.418
It's dead.

01:07:04.187 --> 01:07:05.520
It's dead.

01:07:05.522 --> 01:07:08.590
- No. No.

01:07:09.059 --> 01:07:12.093
No. No. No, no, no.

01:07:12.095 --> 01:07:13.294
- T-Toronto.

01:07:13.296 --> 01:07:15.497
- Don't touch me!

01:07:21.271 --> 01:07:23.304
No, baby. No.

01:07:23.306 --> 01:07:25.407
No. No.

01:07:30.347 --> 01:07:32.380
- What are you doing?

01:07:33.283 --> 01:07:36.351
- Finishing the work
Jezel and I started.

01:07:45.195 --> 01:07:46.795
There are still traces
of the antidote

01:07:46.797 --> 01:07:48.163
in the crocodile's system,

01:07:48.165 --> 01:07:50.198
but oxygen compromised
the integrity of the cure,

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:52.434
and the virus
was able to overpower it.

01:07:52.436 --> 01:07:53.635
- Can we make it stronger?

01:07:53.637 --> 01:07:56.171
- The cure is fine,
but Jezel was right.

01:07:56.173 --> 01:07:58.506
The flaw's
in how it's administered.

01:07:58.508 --> 01:07:59.574
We can only cure the animals

01:07:59.576 --> 01:08:01.509
the same way
that they were infected,

01:08:01.511 --> 01:08:03.511
through a bite.

01:08:04.081 --> 01:08:05.413
And since
the protein in the human blood

01:08:05.415 --> 01:08:09.250
is the only thing that keeps
the antidote stable and pure...

01:08:09.252 --> 01:08:10.585
- They have to bite one of us.

01:08:10.587 --> 01:08:12.687
- We have to inject ourselves
with the antidote

01:08:12.689 --> 01:08:14.456
so they can feed
directly off us,

01:08:14.458 --> 01:08:17.425
essentially turning ourselves
into living vaccines.

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:20.194
- You want us to willingly
feed ourselves to the animals.

01:08:20.197 --> 01:08:24.131
- It's just a theory,
but I think Jezel was right.

01:08:24.134 --> 01:08:26.334
- Yeah, and you saw
what happened to her.

01:08:26.336 --> 01:08:27.102
- Calm down.

01:08:27.104 --> 01:08:29.337
- Your girlfriend wants
to feed us to the animals.

01:08:29.339 --> 01:08:31.673
I knew you vegans
were frickin' crazy!

01:08:31.675 --> 01:08:32.807
- I don't have all the answers.

01:08:32.809 --> 01:08:34.408
I'm still trying
to figure that out.

01:08:34.411 --> 01:08:35.743
I don't want it come to that.

01:08:35.745 --> 01:08:37.479
- Good, 'cause it won't,

01:08:37.481 --> 01:08:38.779
- not even close.
- Quiet!

01:08:40.649 --> 01:08:42.649
- Do you hear that?

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:47.522
- Man, you been
hearing stuff all day.

01:08:48.125 --> 01:08:49.823
- No, wait.

01:08:49.826 --> 01:08:50.558
- Oh, great.

01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:53.694
What kind of animal
is coming to kill us now?

01:08:53.697 --> 01:08:55.796
- That's no animal.

01:08:57.466 --> 01:08:59.300
- It's help.

01:09:03.607 --> 01:09:05.573
Thank God.

01:09:09.179 --> 01:09:12.247
I didn't think
it was gonna get here.

01:09:21.358 --> 01:09:25.426
- Hey, guys! Come on! Let's go!

01:09:25.629 --> 01:09:27.562
- Oh, my God.

01:09:31.268 --> 01:09:33.868
- Behind you! Run!

01:09:33.870 --> 01:09:37.639
- Come on!
- Run, you meathead! Run!

01:09:40.877 --> 01:09:43.578
Oh!

01:09:50.953 --> 01:09:53.688
- Oh, that's not good.

01:09:57.694 --> 01:10:01.429
- Back inside! Back inside!

01:10:05.635 --> 01:10:07.202
How long is this roof
gonna last?

01:10:07.204 --> 01:10:08.403
- We're completely surrounded.

01:10:08.405 --> 01:10:09.737
- Does anyone know
how to fly a chopper?

01:10:09.739 --> 01:10:11.506
- I used to fly one
back in the service,

01:10:11.508 --> 01:10:13.274
but it's not gonna be
much help in here.

01:10:13.276 --> 01:10:14.742
- That's our only way
out of this hellhole.

01:10:14.744 --> 01:10:18.246
- We gotta get to it.
- How? Animals are everywhere.

01:10:18.248 --> 01:10:21.249
- We hold up in this room
until reinforcements arrive.

01:10:21.251 --> 01:10:22.417
Brooke, secure the lab.

01:10:22.419 --> 01:10:25.220
- Hold up in this room?
- Dispatch.

01:10:25.222 --> 01:10:27.589
- Like sheep?
- Dispatch.

01:10:29.292 --> 01:10:31.326
It's not possible.

01:10:31.828 --> 01:10:32.961
They've cut the line.

01:10:32.963 --> 01:10:34.862
- Do we have any other weapons?
- What, you think

01:10:34.864 --> 01:10:36.864
we've got some kind
of hidden arsenal around here?

01:10:36.866 --> 01:10:38.633
They're here!

01:10:38.635 --> 01:10:41.302
They're here!
They're inside the complex.

01:10:41.304 --> 01:10:43.504
- Well, they're
not in this room, so...

01:10:43.506 --> 01:10:44.539
- How long?

01:10:44.541 --> 01:10:46.374
- Long enough for us to stop it.

01:10:46.376 --> 01:10:47.542
One for each of us.

01:10:47.544 --> 01:10:49.010
When the animals
feed off our blood,

01:10:49.012 --> 01:10:51.279
the cure will transfer
directly to their bodies.

01:10:51.281 --> 01:10:52.947
Jezel was right.
The cure doesn't work

01:10:52.949 --> 01:10:55.283
if it's transferred
into a dart or a syringe.

01:10:55.285 --> 01:10:57.418
It's only effective
if it's inside our bodies.

01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:58.987
- But we don't know
if that'll work.

01:10:58.989 --> 01:11:02.323
- The animals will revert back
to their natural state.

01:11:02.325 --> 01:11:04.826
Okay, and this life
that we love and value,

01:11:04.828 --> 01:11:08.029
okay, in this safari and
in other jungles like it,

01:11:08.031 --> 01:11:10.031
it'll continue
to thrive and endure.

01:11:10.033 --> 01:11:11.699
- But what if it doesn't work?

01:11:11.701 --> 01:11:13.534
- It has to work!

01:11:13.536 --> 01:11:14.669
- No.

01:11:14.671 --> 01:11:15.436
- Randy.

01:11:15.438 --> 01:11:17.505
- What about the baby?

01:11:17.507 --> 01:11:18.940
- I can't let you--
- Randy!

01:11:18.942 --> 01:11:21.542
Do you not think
that I've thought about this?

01:11:21.544 --> 01:11:25.413
It's not
an easy decision to make.

01:11:26.316 --> 01:11:27.382
We don't do this,

01:11:27.384 --> 01:11:30.685
there won't be a world
for our child to grow up in

01:11:30.687 --> 01:11:32.553
or anyone else's,
for that matter.

01:11:32.555 --> 01:11:34.756
- Let me see those.
- What are you doing?

01:11:34.758 --> 01:11:35.990
- If I'm gonna kill myself,

01:11:35.992 --> 01:11:39.360
I want to at least look
at what I'm gonna do it with.

01:11:39.362 --> 01:11:42.563
So this is the cure Jezel made?

01:11:44.901 --> 01:11:46.301
- So we're all in this together.

01:11:46.303 --> 01:11:51.606
- No. I'm not gonna let you two
die for a mistake I made.

01:11:51.608 --> 01:11:52.573
Toronto!

01:11:52.575 --> 01:11:54.575
- Help me get him down!
Help me get him down.

01:11:54.577 --> 01:11:55.710
He's going into cardiac arrest!

01:11:55.712 --> 01:11:58.313
- No, it's okay. It's okay!

01:11:58.315 --> 01:12:00.014
It's just icy.

01:12:00.016 --> 01:12:01.883
- Why did you do that?!

01:12:01.885 --> 01:12:04.085
- So you two can escape.

01:12:04.087 --> 01:12:05.953
- You're not invincible,
Toronto.

01:12:05.955 --> 01:12:07.055
- It's an antidote, okay?

01:12:07.057 --> 01:12:10.692
It's not a secret serum
to give you powers!

01:12:13.496 --> 01:12:15.096
- Everyone, back!

01:12:34.551 --> 01:12:36.484
- It worked.

01:12:36.486 --> 01:12:37.452
Jezel was right.

01:12:37.454 --> 01:12:39.821
- What if it doesn't last?

01:12:39.823 --> 01:12:42.890
- Jezel said it'll last,
it'll last.

01:12:42.892 --> 01:12:44.092
That girl knew her stuff.

01:12:44.094 --> 01:12:46.894
- The trick is,
how do we keep you alive

01:12:46.896 --> 01:12:48.830
while they feed off you?

01:12:51.634 --> 01:12:53.468
- We can't.

01:12:53.603 --> 01:12:56.971
I'm just the distraction
so you two can escape.

01:12:56.973 --> 01:13:00.908
- What makes you think
it's gonna be so easy?

01:13:02.946 --> 01:13:03.911
- I'll run out,

01:13:03.913 --> 01:13:07.148
and, when I do,
the animals will chase me,

01:13:07.150 --> 01:13:09.384
and you two can escape.

01:13:09.386 --> 01:13:11.085
- The animals
will just chase you?

01:13:11.087 --> 01:13:14.722
What's gonna stop them
from attacking us?

01:13:15.425 --> 01:13:16.858
- I got it.

01:13:18.528 --> 01:13:20.495
Pheromones.

01:13:24.467 --> 01:13:25.533
We use these for mating purposes

01:13:25.535 --> 01:13:28.069
when two animals
don't quite hit it off.

01:13:28.071 --> 01:13:29.837
- Great. Hose me down.

01:13:29.839 --> 01:13:31.606
- You don't have to do this.

01:13:31.608 --> 01:13:33.174
- We can hole up here.

01:13:33.176 --> 01:13:34.976
We'll find a way
out of the refuge.

01:13:34.978 --> 01:13:37.779
- Did you expect me
to buy that bull?

01:13:38.081 --> 01:13:41.015
- Toronto,
you don't have to die.

01:13:41.017 --> 01:13:43.584
- Guys, I'm already dead.

01:13:43.586 --> 01:13:46.788
My friends are dead.
Jezel's gone.

01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:50.825
But you guys,
you got something to live for.

01:13:52.962 --> 01:13:54.829
Get to the garage!

01:14:00.203 --> 01:14:02.804
- Here! Block it with this!

01:14:04.574 --> 01:14:08.142
- I don't know how long
this is gonna hold!

01:14:09.512 --> 01:14:10.511
- Does this thing run?

01:14:10.513 --> 01:14:11.546
- Yeah. K.D. just fixed it up.

01:14:11.548 --> 01:14:14.015
- Aw, K.D., man.
It's gonna burn him up in heaven

01:14:14.017 --> 01:14:16.884
to see me taking this
on one last glory ride.

01:14:16.886 --> 01:14:18.619
Spray me down!

01:14:23.893 --> 01:14:26.694
Okay. As soon as I'm out of here

01:14:26.696 --> 01:14:28.629
and those animals
start chasing me down,

01:14:28.631 --> 01:14:32.467
you get to that chopper!
Do not hesitate!

01:14:33.903 --> 01:14:36.070
- Absolutely.

01:14:46.249 --> 01:14:48.082
- And another thing.

01:14:48.084 --> 01:14:50.117
That kid you're gonna have...

01:14:50.887 --> 01:14:53.488
don't name it after me.

01:14:53.490 --> 01:14:55.756
Toronto's a stupid name.

01:15:00.763 --> 01:15:01.996
Whoo!

01:15:09.239 --> 01:15:10.972
- He's wrong.

01:15:10.974 --> 01:15:12.673
It's a brave name.

01:15:24.254 --> 01:15:27.221
- This is it. You ready?

01:15:27.891 --> 01:15:30.825
- Whoo! Yeah!

01:15:30.827 --> 01:15:31.926
Yee-hah!

01:15:31.928 --> 01:15:32.660
- N-No!

01:15:32.662 --> 01:15:36.797
- Remember what we promised.
No hesitation.

01:15:37.166 --> 01:15:39.867
- Come and get
some of this fast food,

01:15:39.869 --> 01:15:43.704
you sons of bitches! Whoo!

01:15:51.881 --> 01:15:54.248
- Here. Put these on.

01:15:55.118 --> 01:15:56.918
- You sure you can do this?

01:15:58.021 --> 01:16:00.187
It's like riding a bike.

01:16:02.258 --> 01:16:04.292
Hey, don't worry.

01:16:04.294 --> 01:16:06.794
It's all coming back.

01:16:12.702 --> 01:16:14.235
- Got it.

01:16:19.642 --> 01:16:21.676
We're going home.

01:16:23.212 --> 01:16:25.212
- This was our home.

01:16:50.006 --> 01:16:52.607
- The cure is working.

01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:56.811
- They're changing back.

01:17:20.003 --> 01:17:21.736
- Randy!

01:17:28.711 --> 01:17:31.679
Ahh!

01:17:39.288 --> 01:17:41.022
What the...

01:17:54.003 --> 01:17:55.903
Randy!

01:18:05.715 --> 01:18:07.148
- Ahh!

01:18:07.150 --> 01:18:09.283
- Throw it up into the blades!

01:18:15.224 --> 01:18:16.991
- Brooke!

01:18:18.795 --> 01:18:20.127
Brooke!

01:18:22.031 --> 01:18:22.830
You okay?

01:18:22.832 --> 01:18:24.899
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:18:25.835 --> 01:18:27.134
Your arm.

01:18:28.104 --> 01:18:31.238
- Ah, I've had worse.

01:18:36.179 --> 01:18:38.279
We make quite a pair.

01:18:38.281 --> 01:18:41.348
- Yes, we do. Yeah.

01:18:46.322 --> 01:18:47.922
Hi, Dr. Rogers.
It's Brooke Sullivan

01:18:47.924 --> 01:18:50.191
from the Foundation
for Endangered Animal Rescue.

01:18:50.193 --> 01:18:53.494
- Oh, hi, Brooke.
It's good to hear from you.

01:18:53.496 --> 01:18:54.862
- Hi. I just wanted to call

01:18:54.864 --> 01:18:56.964
and thank you so much
for taking in the animals.

01:18:56.966 --> 01:18:59.834
- Oh, don't mention it.
We're looking forward

01:18:59.836 --> 01:19:03.437
to having a few
new cute faces around here.

01:19:03.439 --> 01:19:04.338
And just so you know,

01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:07.308
I'm personally overseeing
the transfer of the animals.

01:19:07.310 --> 01:19:08.943
They're gonna love
their new home

01:19:08.945 --> 01:19:10.177
here at Eden Wildlife Zoo.

01:19:10.179 --> 01:19:12.947
You have nothing to worry about,
I can assure you.

01:19:12.949 --> 01:19:14.982
- That's great.

01:19:14.984 --> 01:19:16.083
But you have to promise me,

01:19:16.085 --> 01:19:18.419
if the animals start to exhibit
any signs of violent behavior--

01:19:18.421 --> 01:19:21.789
- Brooke, our medical staff
is exceptional.

01:19:21.791 --> 01:19:22.790
Nothing gets past them.

01:19:22.792 --> 01:19:24.158
- Yeah, but if
there is a chance that--

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:27.528
- Listen, Brooke, I know you've
had a traumatizing experience,

01:19:27.530 --> 01:19:30.765
and it's completely
understandable to be paranoid,

01:19:30.767 --> 01:19:34.001
but trust me.
Your nightmare is over.

01:19:34.003 --> 01:19:37.271
The animals are gonna love
their new home.

01:19:37.273 --> 01:19:39.440
Listen, Brooke,
I'm so sorry to cut you off.

01:19:39.442 --> 01:19:41.342
I have this whole
intern orientation thing

01:19:41.344 --> 01:19:42.343
that I gotta set up for,

01:19:42.345 --> 01:19:44.779
because we're opening
in just a few weeks.

01:19:44.781 --> 01:19:45.946
Can we talk later?

01:19:45.948 --> 01:19:47.047
- Yeah.

01:19:47.049 --> 01:19:48.916
- Thanks.

01:20:03.833 --> 01:20:08.869
- Monte, how far away
are you on those monkeys?
