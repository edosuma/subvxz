00:01.302 --> 00:03.537
KARA: When I was a child,
my world ended.

00:05.106 --> 00:06.274
But I was saved.

00:06.307 --> 00:10.344
Sent to Earth to protect
my baby cousin, Kal-El.

00:10.378 --> 00:12.513
But Krypton's destruction
sent a shockwave

00:12.546 --> 00:14.648
that knocked
my ship off-course,

00:14.682 --> 00:16.484
into the Phantom Zone.

00:17.318 --> 00:19.253
Somehow, my pod got loose,

00:19.287 --> 00:21.622
and I made
the long journey to Earth.

00:21.655 --> 00:23.524
Though I was still
a child when I arrived,

00:23.557 --> 00:26.160
my cousin had already
grown up to become

00:26.194 --> 00:28.529
Superman.

00:28.562 --> 00:31.199
I hid who I really was
until one day,

00:31.232 --> 00:33.534
my adoptive sister Alex
was in danger,

00:33.567 --> 00:36.670
and I was forced
to reveal myself to the world.

00:36.704 --> 00:40.808
From that day on,
I became Supergirl.

00:40.841 --> 00:44.312
Now, I work in secret
with my sister and the DEO

00:44.345 --> 00:46.580
to fight alien menaces
that threaten the Earth

00:46.614 --> 00:49.183
and others that
would cause my city harm.

00:49.217 --> 00:50.584
I have friends.

00:51.585 --> 00:53.053
And allies.

00:53.487 --> 00:54.488
I have a family.

00:54.522 --> 00:57.658
After so many years
of being lost,

00:57.691 --> 00:59.427
I am finally home.

01:00.628 --> 01:02.830
Three, two, one!

01:02.863 --> 01:04.632
(ALL CHEERING)

01:07.868 --> 01:10.171
-To Supergirl.
-No, no. Wait, wait.

01:10.871 --> 01:13.574
To family. Love bonds us all.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.477
-To family.

-WINN: Whoa!

01:19.213 --> 01:21.081
-What was that?
-What the hell?

01:23.551 --> 01:24.618
Nothing good.

01:32.493 --> 01:34.862
We need to stop it, or there
could be major casualties.

01:34.895 --> 01:36.297
I've got it.

01:39.900 --> 01:41.569
I've almost got it.

01:42.370 --> 01:43.371
Ahh!

01:45.773 --> 01:46.774
(SCREAMING)

01:46.807 --> 01:48.442
I've got him. Supergirl, go!

02:10.631 --> 02:11.932
SUPERGIRL: That pod...

02:11.965 --> 02:13.734
It's identical to mine.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.169
It's from Krypton.

02:17.871 --> 02:19.373
J'ONN: Supergirl, be careful.

02:21.242 --> 02:22.543
You don't know
what's in there.

02:25.546 --> 02:27.215
-(GLASS SHATTERING)
-(SUPERGIRL GRUNTS)

02:31.552 --> 02:32.553
Oh, my God.

02:46.567 --> 02:47.568
Where are we?

02:49.303 --> 02:51.372
The Department
of Extra-Normal Operations.

02:51.405 --> 02:52.706
Wait! Wait, wait, wait.

02:52.740 --> 02:55.609
This has always been here?
With the glass

02:55.643 --> 02:56.610
and the views and...

02:56.644 --> 02:59.213
And you made me
fly to that cave every day!

02:59.247 --> 03:00.814
DEO has
several facilities, Kara.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.716
A bat bit me in the last one.

03:02.750 --> 03:03.751
Whiner.

03:06.554 --> 03:07.221
Hey, sis.

03:07.255 --> 03:09.290
You knew about
this place, too?

03:09.323 --> 03:11.459
Yeah, it's like
a block from my apartment.

03:11.492 --> 03:13.994
It's kind of like
the old place. Maybe better.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.230
Well, where's the man
who fell to Earth?

03:18.866 --> 03:20.601
He has to be from Krypton.

03:20.634 --> 03:22.470
He must have escaped
before the planet exploded,

03:22.503 --> 03:23.837
like Clark and I did.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.339
He's comatose.

03:25.373 --> 03:27.241
His vitals are stable.
Breathing is normal.

03:27.275 --> 03:29.910
There's nothing else
we can really learn
from him because...

03:29.943 --> 03:31.579
That proves he's from Krypton.

03:31.612 --> 03:32.980
It only proves he's not human,

03:33.013 --> 03:34.715
which means
he could be dangerous.

03:34.748 --> 03:38.386
Sir, I would request that Winn
help with the investigation.

03:38.419 --> 03:40.554
We need someone to
analyze the pod's telemetry,

03:40.588 --> 03:41.955
and Winn does read Kryptonian.

03:41.989 --> 03:44.758
I got bored. I thought I'd
pick up a new language.

03:44.792 --> 03:45.993
Space talk!

03:46.026 --> 03:48.429
You want to prove
your worth, Mr. Schott?

03:48.462 --> 03:49.663
Find out something my team

03:49.697 --> 03:52.333
of highly trained
alien experts can't.

03:53.033 --> 03:54.568
Challenge accepted.

03:54.968 --> 03:56.337
Let's go.

03:56.370 --> 03:57.838
We'll figure it out, Kara.
I promise.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.675
So, are you watching
the Venture launch tonight?

04:01.709 --> 04:03.010
No, actually,

04:03.043 --> 04:05.313
James and I are
going on our first date.

04:05.346 --> 04:06.747
It's gonna be great.

04:06.780 --> 04:09.417
We are finally both free
and clear to just hang out.

04:09.450 --> 04:11.652
No aliens trying
to destroy the Earth.

04:11.685 --> 04:16.790
Just him and me, together
like normal people,
doing what people do on dates.

04:16.824 --> 04:18.426
Okay.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.428
-What?
-What, what?

04:20.461 --> 04:21.895
You're doing that thing
where you say "Okay,"

04:21.929 --> 04:23.364
but you're not actually okay.

04:23.397 --> 04:24.798
Because you're doing
that thing where you are

04:24.832 --> 04:27.034
super overeager, which
means that you really aren't,

04:27.067 --> 04:29.537
but you're trying to convince
yourself that you are.

04:29.570 --> 04:31.071
I am not doing that thing.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.341
That's... I'm excited.

04:33.374 --> 04:34.908
This is me excited.

04:34.942 --> 04:36.577
-Mmm-hmm.
-(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

04:36.610 --> 04:39.079
And this is
Ms. Grant texting me.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.714
I'm not her assistant anymore.

04:41.782 --> 04:42.816
I have to go.

04:44.652 --> 04:47.421
We are just hours away
from the launch of Venture,

04:47.455 --> 04:48.522
the first
commercial spacecraft

04:48.556 --> 04:50.891
designed for
suborbital transportation.

04:50.924 --> 04:52.426
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

04:53.694 --> 04:56.397
You wanted to
see me, Ms. Grant?

04:56.430 --> 04:58.031
(SCOFFS) They offered me
a seat on the Venture,

04:58.065 --> 04:59.433
but I turned them down.

04:59.467 --> 05:00.801
What would I possibly
have in common

05:00.834 --> 05:03.003
with a bunch of rich people
in a rocket ship

05:03.036 --> 05:06.807
seeking existential answers
to their meaningless lives?

05:06.840 --> 05:09.843
Speaking of which,
what's your answer?

05:09.877 --> 05:11.479
Wha...

05:11.512 --> 05:14.648
-What's the question?
-Your vocation. What is it?

05:14.682 --> 05:16.750
Oh, you mean
what job do I want?

05:16.784 --> 05:18.819
Um, well...

05:18.852 --> 05:21.088
I don't know.
I haven't really decided yet.

05:21.121 --> 05:22.556
Why not?

05:22.590 --> 05:24.592
Well, it's only been 12 hours

05:24.625 --> 05:26.494
since you asked me
to choose a new position,

05:26.527 --> 05:29.096
and then most of those
hours I was asleep.

05:29.129 --> 05:30.398
Really?

05:30.431 --> 05:32.533
I offer you
the keys to the kingdom,

05:32.566 --> 05:34.968
and you just go to sleep?

05:35.002 --> 05:36.637
It was nighttime.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.839
How many hours do you think
I slept last night, Ker-rah?

05:38.872 --> 05:40.574
Two.

05:40.608 --> 05:42.810
Because I care about making
the most out of my life.

05:42.843 --> 05:46.480
I squeeze every drop
out of every single day.

05:47.548 --> 05:49.683
-Sleeping is for slackers.
-Right.

05:49.717 --> 05:52.720
Well, I did do
this online quiz

05:52.753 --> 05:54.588
where, you know,
you list all your skills,

05:54.622 --> 05:56.857
and then it uses
this kind of algorithm

05:56.890 --> 05:59.059
to calculate
your ideal career.

05:59.092 --> 06:02.596
And mine was marketing.

06:02.930 --> 06:04.131
Mmm.

06:04.164 --> 06:07.568
And according to
the Catco website,

06:07.601 --> 06:09.903
marketing ranks
high in potential salary,

06:09.937 --> 06:13.006
future growth and,
interestingly enough,

06:13.040 --> 06:14.775
work-life balance which...

06:17.478 --> 06:18.646
What do you think?

06:20.113 --> 06:24.718
I think that it is
the most pathetic thing
I have ever heard.

06:26.754 --> 06:27.755
Oh, okay.

06:27.788 --> 06:30.524
You can't Internet search
a calling, Ker-rah.

06:30.558 --> 06:33.461
A calling is something
that is within you.

06:33.494 --> 06:35.028
Do you think that
Supergirl is a hero

06:35.062 --> 06:37.765
because flying is
one of her skills? No.

06:37.798 --> 06:40.434
She's a hero
because she has a need.

06:40.468 --> 06:42.402
To help people,
to protect the planet.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.137
Look inward,

06:44.171 --> 06:49.042
and figure out
what Kara Danvers
needs to do with her life.

06:49.076 --> 06:52.179
I am granting you two more
days, as in 48 hours,

06:52.212 --> 06:53.714
and whatever you do,
don't come back

with the results
of a Rorschach test.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.453

07:01.555 --> 07:02.756
Yes, Ms. Grant.

07:02.790 --> 07:05.826

look drizzled on?

07:06.527 --> 07:08.462
-Yes.
-No.

07:08.496 --> 07:09.897
No, this lettuce is drowning.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.832
It's floating
on a sea of ranch,

07:11.865 --> 07:14.101

Kate Winslet's in Titanic.

07:14.134 --> 07:15.636
Get it out of my sight.

07:18.739 --> 07:21.542
This is the best
replacement for you

07:21.575 --> 07:22.710
you could come up with?

07:22.743 --> 07:24.512
Just give her
a chance, please.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.514
She is so smart and sweet.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.115
She went to Yale.

07:28.148 --> 07:29.583
So did George Bush.

have the Venture launch on.

08:33.781 --> 08:35.616

space program you are.

it's fine.

08:41.789 --> 08:44.892
Well, maybe I'll just put
it on without the sound.

09:27.968 --> 09:29.970
(STAMMERING) Yeah,
I understand, Mr. White.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.640
No, Mr. White.

Yes, Mr. White.

Yes, I will have my article
on your desk lickety-split.

Yes, sir, I know that no one
says "lickety-split" anymore.

"Great Caesar's ghost,"

12:54.374 --> 12:56.576
-It's an honor, sir.
-Pleasure.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.478
I just want to thank you all
for your hard work

12:58.511 --> 13:00.347
protecting Earth.

13:00.380 --> 13:02.082
Oh, brother.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.884
Did you know
she was bringing him here?

13:03.917 --> 13:05.052
No.

13:05.986 --> 13:07.020
Is that a problem?

13:08.055 --> 13:09.589
Oh. He's coming toward me.

13:09.622 --> 13:12.860
Winn, this is
my cousin, Superman.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.427
Hi.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.563
I have a million questions.

13:16.596 --> 13:17.730
Okay...

13:17.764 --> 13:20.233
When Lex Luthor set off
the earthquake in California,

13:20.267 --> 13:22.936
did you gauge the focal depth
with your X-ray vision?

13:22.970 --> 13:24.071
Winn...

13:24.104 --> 13:25.105
Breathe.

13:27.374 --> 13:29.242
Alex.

13:29.276 --> 13:31.044
-It's good to see you.
-You, too.

13:31.078 --> 13:33.413
Kara told me
Jeremiah may be alive.

13:33.446 --> 13:36.149
And you know your father
means a lot to me, so...

13:36.183 --> 13:37.250
If there's anything I can do.

13:37.284 --> 13:38.485
Thank you, Clark.

13:40.453 --> 13:43.256
-J'onn.
-Superman.

13:43.290 --> 13:44.424
Nice to see you again.

13:44.457 --> 13:46.093
Oh, don't worry.
I won't be staying long.

13:47.660 --> 13:51.331
Uh, I just invited Superman
to visit our mystery guest.

13:51.364 --> 13:52.499
Follow me.

13:55.969 --> 13:57.837
-What's with those two?
-Beats me.

13:59.139 --> 14:00.373
Your cousin smells terrific.

14:00.407 --> 14:01.608
Enough.

14:04.211 --> 14:07.180
He landed on Earth last night
in a Kryptonian pod.

14:07.214 --> 14:09.049
We don't know who he is.

14:09.082 --> 14:10.483
(SIGHS) Did you try using
a Quantum scan
to determine his age?

14:10.517 --> 14:12.019
First thing we did.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.453
And you X-ray-visioned him
for foreign objects,

14:13.486 --> 14:15.355
like a cybernetic data core?

14:15.388 --> 14:16.656
Of course.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.158
(SUPERGIRL CLEARS THROAT)

14:18.191 --> 14:19.626
-You should probably go
and do that.
-Mmm-hmm.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.397
Nope, no data core.

14:24.431 --> 14:25.665
So, my handy translator

14:25.698 --> 14:28.135
just finished decrypting
the pod's data log.

14:28.168 --> 14:31.438
Now, it seems sleeping beauty
on his journey from Krypton

14:31.471 --> 14:34.474
passed through something
called the Segara Beyal.

14:34.507 --> 14:36.276
The Well of Stars.

14:36.309 --> 14:38.478
My father took me there once.

14:38.511 --> 14:39.646
Time doesn't pass there.

14:39.679 --> 14:41.348
So that's why
he's still so young.

14:41.381 --> 14:42.983
Oh.

14:43.016 --> 14:44.584
Oh, hey, speaking of age,
I've been meaning to ask.

14:44.617 --> 14:47.120
Superman, you're 12 years
older than Kara, right?

14:47.154 --> 14:48.321
'Cause you do not look it.

14:48.355 --> 14:51.324
Kryptonians age
at a much slower rate
here on Earth.

14:51.358 --> 14:52.392
You look fantastic.

14:52.425 --> 14:53.961
When you're finished,

14:53.994 --> 14:55.195
we have something
more important to talk about.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.197
-What?
-The Venture.

14:58.665 --> 15:00.633
The company behind the Venture
said there was an explosion

15:00.667 --> 15:03.103
when the ship
reached low orbit insertion.

15:03.136 --> 15:04.137
So?

15:04.171 --> 15:06.006
Well, if something like that
was gonna go wrong

15:06.039 --> 15:06.673
it would've happened
earlier in the flight.

15:06.706 --> 15:07.874
Exactly.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.676
The Venture was built here
in National City.

15:09.709 --> 15:12.412
I think we should
investigate this further.

15:12.445 --> 15:15.148
Maybe a mild-mannered reporter
should make some inquiries

15:15.182 --> 15:16.716
while he's here
in National City.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.318
Actually, I was gonna have
my team take a look at it.

15:18.351 --> 15:20.287
Well, Superman's here.
We should include him.

15:20.320 --> 15:21.454
You can work out of Catco.

15:21.488 --> 15:22.722
Just steer clear of Ms. Grant.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.291
She's been in a mood.

15:24.324 --> 15:27.594
Don't worry, I've got
some sway with Cat Grant.

15:29.029 --> 15:30.998
So what happened
between you and Superman?

15:32.399 --> 15:34.401
Nothing.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.003
It just seems like...

15:36.603 --> 15:38.505
This conversation is over.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.040
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

15:44.544 --> 15:46.446
Sorry. Oops!

15:46.479 --> 15:48.315
So sorry,
that was totally my fault.

15:48.348 --> 15:50.984
(CHUCKLING) You really have
that klutzy thing down,
don't you?

15:51.018 --> 15:53.220
Uh, yeah. No,
that was actually real.

15:55.022 --> 15:56.656
-Clark!
-There he is.

15:56.689 --> 15:59.059
-What's up, man?
-Jimmy.

15:59.092 --> 16:00.260
It's good to see you, buddy.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.062
It's good to see you,
too, brother.

16:02.095 --> 16:03.696
Well, everybody at
the Daily Planet misses you.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.665
-Lois, Mr. White.
-I miss them, too.

16:05.698 --> 16:08.101
But I really like living here.

16:08.135 --> 16:09.202
Good.

16:12.605 --> 16:14.174
Excuse me.

16:15.375 --> 16:17.577
Ms. Grant? You okay?

16:17.610 --> 16:19.779
You didn't tell me
that you know Clark Kent.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.614
Oh, God, not you, too.

16:21.648 --> 16:22.749
-What?
-Nothing.

16:22.782 --> 16:24.784
I do... Yes. I know him.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.786
Him and Jimmy
have been friends for years.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.755
Do I have anything
in my teeth?

16:28.788 --> 16:29.989
No.

16:33.093 --> 16:33.893
(SIGHS)

16:33.926 --> 16:36.496
Clark Kent,
as I live and breathe.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.265
Well, don't you just look

16:38.298 --> 16:42.502
-all Midwestern dashing?
-(CLARK CHUCKLES)

16:42.535 --> 16:43.736
Ms. Grant,
it's good to see you.

16:43.770 --> 16:46.539
-It's been a long time.
-No fault of mine.

16:46.573 --> 16:49.776
So, are you still seeing
Lois Lane, or did
that fizzle out

16:49.809 --> 16:51.611
like I predicted
in the office pool?

16:51.644 --> 16:53.813
No one ever sent me my $20.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.648
Lois and I are great.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.117
We're still...
Still going strong.

16:57.150 --> 16:59.819
Oh, so she's not
still hung up on Superman?

16:59.852 --> 17:03.090
(CHUCKLING) You know,
I'd say that she has

17:03.123 --> 17:04.691
room in her life
for both of us.

17:05.425 --> 17:08.295
Well, that's modern.

17:09.162 --> 17:10.663
Oh, no.

17:10.697 --> 17:13.266
So, how would you like
to go on a tour?

17:13.300 --> 17:15.735
Perry White was a fool to ever
let you out of his sight.

17:15.768 --> 17:18.205
I might just poach you.

17:19.672 --> 17:21.708
Sway.

17:21.741 --> 17:23.610
Did Ms. Grant
seem a little off to you?

17:23.643 --> 17:26.146
She's always like that
with Clark.
She goes gaga for him.

17:26.179 --> 17:28.748
She actually sent him
a drunk text once. It was...

17:29.516 --> 17:31.284
-It was florid.
-No.

17:31.318 --> 17:33.220
Ugh. That's gross.

17:33.253 --> 17:35.355
Yeah, I saw what you
did on TV.

17:35.388 --> 17:36.556
-Good save.
-Thanks.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.558
I'm sorry
it interrupted our date.

17:38.591 --> 17:40.227
-No, it's fine.
-No, but it isn't.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.162
It's not fine. Not.

17:42.195 --> 17:43.863
That was
an important step for us.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.598
And I will make it up to you,
I promise.

17:45.632 --> 17:48.535
We will make a plan,
and we will execute it.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.303
Fully.

17:50.337 --> 17:53.440
That sounds romantic.

17:53.473 --> 17:56.343
You know what I mean.
I just... I want it to work.

17:57.344 --> 17:58.345
Me, too.

17:58.878 --> 18:01.181
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

18:01.214 --> 18:02.782
-It's Alex.
-Yeah, go ahead.

18:03.483 --> 18:04.751
What's up?

18:06.319 --> 18:07.820
Yeah, yeah,
I think Clark knows

18:07.854 --> 18:09.789
a thing or two
about that name.

18:09.822 --> 18:11.558
-Clark.
-Yeah.

18:11.591 --> 18:12.825
Alex did some digging.

18:12.859 --> 18:14.394
-What is it?
-There was one passenger

18:14.427 --> 18:15.795
who had a seat booked
on the Venture

18:15.828 --> 18:17.764
who mysteriously didn't
show up last-minute.

18:17.797 --> 18:19.432
Lena Luthor.

18:19.466 --> 18:20.867
-Lex's sister.
-Yup.

18:20.900 --> 18:23.603
But Lex can't be involved
in this. He's in prison.

18:23.636 --> 18:25.605
-Congrats, by the way.
-Yeah, thanks.

18:25.638 --> 18:26.873
Well, Lex may be in jail,

18:26.906 --> 18:28.341
but his sister
is now running Luthor Corp.

18:28.375 --> 18:30.777
Yep, and she just moved
to National City.

18:34.781 --> 18:37.317
MAN: Heavy tactical
unmanned aerial vehicle

18:37.350 --> 18:39.919
with 160 km range.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.388
If you're looking
to hurt somebody,

18:41.421 --> 18:43.856
this is definitely
the way to do it.

18:43.890 --> 18:46.926
CORBEN: And to control it?
MAN: Everything
from the cockpit.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.229
Just like you were
flying an aircraft.

18:50.763 --> 18:53.366
How do I activate
the targeting system?

18:53.400 --> 18:54.501
Ah.

18:54.534 --> 18:56.169
That button right there.

18:56.203 --> 18:59.306
She'll lock into the target,
and then it's lights out.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.318
Thank you
for all your hard work.

19:13.320 --> 19:14.321
(GROANS)

19:16.756 --> 19:17.790
Corben.

19:17.824 --> 19:20.660
Yeah, the ship didn't explode.

19:20.693 --> 19:22.795
Superman and Supergirl
saved it.

19:22.829 --> 19:25.398
I'm switching to plan B.

19:25.432 --> 19:27.300
Have I ever
let the Luthors down?

19:30.002 --> 19:31.904
LENA: There's a perfectly
reasonable explanation

19:31.938 --> 19:33.973
for why I wasn't aboard
the Venture yesterday.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.408
CLARK: Well, that's
why we're here.

19:35.442 --> 19:37.210
There was an emergency

19:37.244 --> 19:39.546
regarding the planning
for a ceremony
I'm holding tomorrow.

19:39.579 --> 19:42.349
I'm renaming
my family's company,
and I had to cancel.

19:42.382 --> 19:43.550
Ah, lucky.

19:43.583 --> 19:46.553
(CHUCKLING) Lucky is
Superman saving the day.

19:46.586 --> 19:48.421
Not something one expects
a Luthor to say.

19:48.455 --> 19:49.956
Right. And Supergirl
was there, too.

19:52.459 --> 19:53.960
And who are you exactly?

19:53.993 --> 19:55.094
Um...

19:55.127 --> 19:57.330
I'm Kara Danvers.
I'm not with the Daily Planet.

19:57.364 --> 19:59.699
I'm with Catco magazine.
Sort of.

19:59.732 --> 20:02.835
It's a publication
not known for its
hard-hitting journalism.

20:02.869 --> 20:05.538
More like "High-waisted Jeans,
Yes or No?"

20:05.572 --> 20:08.575
-I'm just tagging along today.
-Right.

20:08.608 --> 20:10.710
Can we just speed
this interview along?

20:10.743 --> 20:12.979
Just ask me what you want
to ask, Mr. Kent.

20:13.012 --> 20:14.981
Did I have anything to do
with the Venture explosion?

20:16.383 --> 20:18.318
Did you?

20:18.351 --> 20:20.687
You wouldn't be asking me
if my last name was Smith.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.590
Ah, but it's not. It's Luthor.

20:23.623 --> 20:26.593
Some steel
under that Kansas wheat.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.862
It wasn't always.

20:29.896 --> 20:32.732
I was adopted when I was four.

20:32.765 --> 20:36.736
And the person who made me
feel most welcome
in the family was Lex.

20:36.769 --> 20:39.772
He made me proud
to be a Luthor.

20:39.806 --> 20:42.809
And then he went on his
reign of terror in Metropolis.

20:42.842 --> 20:45.345
Declared war on Superman.

20:45.378 --> 20:47.013
Committed unspeakable crimes.

20:48.915 --> 20:50.517
When Superman put Lex in jail,

20:50.550 --> 20:52.585
I vowed to take back
my family's company.

20:52.619 --> 20:54.487
To rename it L-Corp.

20:54.521 --> 20:57.524
Make it a force for good.

20:57.557 --> 21:01.461
I'm just a woman trying to
make a name for herself
outside of her family.

21:01.494 --> 21:02.795
Can you understand that?

21:03.563 --> 21:04.864
Yeah.

21:06.065 --> 21:07.900
I know why you're here.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.636
Because a subsidiary
of my company

21:09.669 --> 21:12.772
made the part that exploded
on the Venture.

21:12.805 --> 21:16.609
This drive contains
all the information
we have on the oscillator.

21:16.643 --> 21:18.578
I hope it helps you
in your investigation.

21:20.947 --> 21:21.581
Thank you.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.683
Give me a chance, Mr. Kent.

21:23.716 --> 21:25.785
I'm here for a fresh start.
Let me have one.

21:27.086 --> 21:28.788
Good day, Ms. Luthor.

21:29.422 --> 21:30.790
Good day.

21:36.563 --> 21:38.631
I didn't see anything when I
X-ray-visioned the room.

21:38.665 --> 21:40.333
Yeah, me neither.

21:40.367 --> 21:41.801
What do you think?

21:41.834 --> 21:43.570
I've learned
through hard experience

21:43.603 --> 21:45.838
not to believe anything
a Luthor says.

21:45.872 --> 21:47.774
Yeah, I know I'm not
a reporter or anything,

21:47.807 --> 21:50.510
but I kinda believed her.

21:50.543 --> 21:51.844
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

21:53.012 --> 21:54.581
Hi, sweetie.

21:54.614 --> 21:55.848
Yeah, I'm with Kara.

21:55.882 --> 21:58.685
-Yes, I'm being careful.
-(KARA LAUGHS)

21:58.718 --> 22:01.821
I miss you, too.
I love you. Bye.

22:01.854 --> 22:03.690
I love that
she worries about you.

22:03.723 --> 22:05.758
Yeah, me, too.

22:05.792 --> 22:08.395
How do you do it all, Clark?

22:08.428 --> 22:11.130
You're an amazing reporter,
a great boyfriend,

22:11.163 --> 22:14.567
and Superman.

22:14.601 --> 22:15.902
I mean,
I love being Supergirl.

22:15.935 --> 22:17.504
That part of my life is clear.

22:17.537 --> 22:20.407
But the rest of it...

22:21.173 --> 22:23.676
You mean Jimmy?

22:23.710 --> 22:26.846
-How'd you know that?
-It's super telepathy.

22:26.879 --> 22:28.515
It's a power
you'll get someday.

22:28.548 --> 22:30.583
-Really?
-No.

22:30.617 --> 22:32.652
Jimmy and I are friends,
we talk.

22:35.722 --> 22:38.124
For so long,
I kept my head down

22:38.157 --> 22:39.459
and moved forward.

22:39.492 --> 22:41.528
And life was simple.

22:41.561 --> 22:43.730
And now I have
all these options.

22:43.763 --> 22:48.367
An amazing guy
and any job I want and I'm...

22:49.536 --> 22:50.703
I'm stuck.

22:51.904 --> 22:53.606
I've been where you are.

22:53.640 --> 22:56.008
You know, trying to figure out
how to be Clark and Superman.

22:56.042 --> 22:57.710
Yeah, but you made it
look so easy.

22:57.744 --> 22:59.111
Well, it wasn't.

22:59.145 --> 23:00.680
It's still not.

23:01.714 --> 23:03.883
Look, all I know
is that being Kara

23:03.916 --> 23:06.118
is just as important
as being Supergirl.

23:08.788 --> 23:11.724
-Come here.
-That's really nice.

23:11.758 --> 23:13.826
Trust yourself, Kara.

23:13.860 --> 23:15.194
Listen to your heart.

23:15.227 --> 23:17.430
If things are right
with James, you'll know it.

23:22.635 --> 23:25.137
What's on your mind,
Agent Danvers?

23:25.171 --> 23:28.007
I know why you and Superman
aren't the best of friends.

23:30.543 --> 23:31.978
Operation Emerald.

23:33.145 --> 23:34.914
How did you
find out about that?

23:34.947 --> 23:38.651
I cross-referenced your
personnel file with Superman.

23:38.685 --> 23:42.054
Back when I first
took over the DEO,

23:42.088 --> 23:44.824
we got a report
about a meteorite
coming down in the desert.

23:44.857 --> 23:46.058
Superman would work with us
back then,

23:46.092 --> 23:48.995
so we both headed out
to investigate.

23:49.028 --> 23:51.063
We got there,
it was dark and...

23:51.097 --> 23:53.700
But I could see something
down in the crater.

23:53.733 --> 23:56.503
Green, glowing
like an emerald.

23:56.536 --> 23:58.938
It didn't affect me, but
Superman got down there,

23:58.971 --> 24:01.073
he started heaving.

24:01.107 --> 24:01.974
Passed out.

24:02.008 --> 24:05.745
-It was Kryptonite.
-I named it that.

24:05.778 --> 24:07.680
Superman wanted
to destroy it all.

24:07.714 --> 24:09.181
ALEX: But you kept it.

24:09.215 --> 24:11.884
He was not the only
Kryptonian out there, Alex.

24:11.918 --> 24:13.553
Their powers are limitless.

24:13.586 --> 24:15.688
Now we have a way to protect
ourselves from them.

24:15.722 --> 24:17.724
Except "them"
now includes my sister.

24:18.625 --> 24:19.959
WINN: We may have a problem.

24:19.992 --> 24:21.661
I've been going over the data
from Luthor Corp.

24:21.694 --> 24:24.096
Now, the oscillator
that exploded on the Venture,

24:24.130 --> 24:27.099
it was located underneath the
main passenger cabin, right?

24:27.133 --> 24:30.236
In fact, it was housed
under seat 23B.

24:30.269 --> 24:32.271
Which is relevant how,
Mr. Schott?

24:32.304 --> 24:33.840
According to the manifest,

24:33.873 --> 24:37.176
guess who was supposed
to be sitting in seat 23B?

24:38.845 --> 24:40.079
Lena Luthor.

24:40.112 --> 24:42.749
Lena Luthor
wasn't behind the explosion.

24:43.550 --> 24:44.917
She was the target.

24:51.157 --> 24:53.159
Should be a smooth flight,
Ms. Luthor.

24:53.860 --> 24:55.528
I hate flying.

24:55.562 --> 24:56.729
I know statistically,

24:56.763 --> 24:58.965
it's the safest way
to travel, but still...

25:07.306 --> 25:08.775
What the hell?

25:36.936 --> 25:38.671
I thought you two
might show up.

25:38.705 --> 25:40.106
You spoil all the fun.

25:40.139 --> 25:41.340
You know, if you were
expecting us to show up,

25:41.373 --> 25:42.809
you really should've
brought something

25:42.842 --> 25:44.644
a little more powerful.

25:44.677 --> 25:46.112
I did. I brought my wits.

25:46.145 --> 25:47.914
I've drones planted
throughout the city,

25:47.947 --> 25:50.817
targeting civilian
populations as we speak.

25:52.685 --> 25:54.186
Your choice, aliens.

25:54.220 --> 25:56.789
Innocent civilians
or the chopper?

25:56.823 --> 25:58.925
Go. I got the chopper.

26:42.001 --> 26:43.936
BOY: That was awesome.

26:46.706 --> 26:48.240
We're moving back to Gotham.

26:52.378 --> 26:53.880
(SCREAMS)

27:03.455 --> 27:04.724
You're safe now.

27:04.757 --> 27:06.225
What the hell was that?

27:06.258 --> 27:08.027
Someone's trying to kill you.

27:14.867 --> 27:16.869
Hey, I've been
looking for you.

27:16.903 --> 27:19.205
So, listen,
I know that I've been

27:19.238 --> 27:21.674
dealing with drone attacks
and spaceships...

27:21.708 --> 27:22.875
Two spaceships.

27:22.909 --> 27:24.677
But I will not let that
get in the way of us

27:24.711 --> 27:26.012
having the perfect date.

27:26.045 --> 27:27.246
I was thinking maybe Italian.

27:27.279 --> 27:31.017
-I could fly there...
-It's okay. I...

27:31.050 --> 27:33.285
Just admit,
something's changed for you.

27:33.319 --> 27:35.221
-James...
-And don't tell me I'm wrong

27:35.254 --> 27:38.124
or that I'm imagining
something, 'cause I know you.

27:40.159 --> 27:42.061
I thought this is
what you wanted.

27:42.461 --> 27:43.930
It was.

27:46.899 --> 27:48.200
And now?

27:48.868 --> 27:50.136
I...

27:51.437 --> 27:53.072
I don't know.

27:55.274 --> 27:57.744
Well, it's honest at least.

28:05.217 --> 28:07.820
CAT: Ms. Tessmacher!

28:07.854 --> 28:09.355
-(CAT GROANS)
-(SOBBING)

28:11.223 --> 28:13.826
She cries more than
Halle Berry at award shows.

28:13.860 --> 28:16.228
Well, if you hate her so much,
why don't you fire her?

28:16.262 --> 28:17.864
Normally, you'd ax
an assistant

28:17.897 --> 28:20.066
the second they brought you
a latte one degree off.

28:20.099 --> 28:22.234
Oh, Ker-rah.

28:22.268 --> 28:25.772
I don't even know
what normal is anymore.

28:26.472 --> 28:28.808
Ms. Grant, what's wrong?

28:28.841 --> 28:30.142
What could be wrong?

28:30.176 --> 28:31.778
I have followed every one
of my passions,

28:31.811 --> 28:34.080
I've achieved everything
I've ever wanted to achieve,

28:34.113 --> 28:36.515
and I'm at the very top
of my game.

28:36.548 --> 28:38.918
The question is, Ker-rah,

28:38.951 --> 28:41.487
what the hell is wrong
with you?

28:41.520 --> 28:44.323
You're young, brilliant,
and you have the world
at your feet.

28:44.356 --> 28:45.958
You have the man
you pined for,

28:45.992 --> 28:47.794
any job you wish for,

28:47.827 --> 28:50.930
and you stand there
blinking like a doe
in the headlights.

28:50.963 --> 28:52.364
Frozen.

28:52.398 --> 28:53.399
I'm...

28:55.534 --> 28:57.536
Yeah, you know what?

28:57.569 --> 28:59.538
You're right, Ms. Grant.

28:59.571 --> 29:02.208
You are absolutely right.
In some areas of my life,

29:02.241 --> 29:05.511
I feel so strong
and confident,

29:05.544 --> 29:08.781
and then in
every other area...

29:08.815 --> 29:10.282
Career, love, I...

29:11.083 --> 29:12.518
I don't know what to do.

29:12.551 --> 29:14.253
Dive.

29:14.286 --> 29:18.157
What do you mean, like...
Like into a lake?

29:18.190 --> 29:19.992
You're standing on the shore,

29:20.026 --> 29:21.460
afraid to dive
into the new waters,

29:21.493 --> 29:24.230
and you're afraid because
you don't wanna say goodbye

29:24.263 --> 29:27.533
to the mild-mannered,
lovelorn Kara Danvers,

29:27.566 --> 29:30.236
the sweet and dutiful
assistant to Cat Grant.

29:30.269 --> 29:31.804
You are standing there

29:31.838 --> 29:33.372
looking out at your options,

29:33.405 --> 29:36.142
the icy blue water,
the fast-flowing river,

29:36.175 --> 29:37.409
and the choppy sea.

29:37.443 --> 29:39.345
And they all look
very appealing to you

29:39.378 --> 29:41.147
because you're dying to go
for a swim,

29:41.180 --> 29:43.382
but you know that water
is going to be cold,

29:43.415 --> 29:45.351
and the journey
is going to be hard,

29:45.384 --> 29:47.253
and when you reach
the other side,

29:47.286 --> 29:49.421
you will have become
a new person.

29:49.455 --> 29:54.260
And you are scared
to meet that new version
of yourself.

29:54.293 --> 29:59.431
Now, we all get used
to our own personas,

29:59.465 --> 30:02.001
and we're used to
our own comfort zones,

30:02.034 --> 30:04.403
but, trust me,

30:06.205 --> 30:10.142
in order to live,
we must keep daring.

30:10.176 --> 30:12.244
Keep diving.

30:12.611 --> 30:13.846
Yeah.

30:15.614 --> 30:18.384
Thank you, Ms. Grant.

30:18.417 --> 30:23.089
You have 12 hours,
13 minutes, and 4 seconds.

30:23.122 --> 30:25.157
-Tick-tock.
-Right.

30:29.495 --> 30:33.232
This thing is like
state-of-the-state-of-the-art.

30:33.265 --> 30:35.134
Kind of looks like something
my dad might have built

30:35.167 --> 30:37.269
in one of his more
murdery moments.

30:37.303 --> 30:40.339
We've acquired a partial print
from the wreckage.

30:40.372 --> 30:41.140
John Corben.

30:41.173 --> 30:43.175
International assassin
for hire.

30:43.209 --> 30:45.244
He's been linked to Intergang,
Kasnian terrorists,

30:45.277 --> 30:47.479
and the genocide
in Corto Maltese.

30:47.513 --> 30:49.381
If you want somebody
high-profile killed,

30:49.415 --> 30:50.249
this is the guy to hire.

30:50.282 --> 30:52.318
But who would want
Lena Luthor dead?

30:52.351 --> 30:53.785
Hey, where's Kara?

30:53.819 --> 30:56.388
Trying to talk Lena
out of going through
with the renaming ceremony.

30:56.422 --> 30:58.524
Sound likes she's just
as stubborn as her brother.

30:58.557 --> 31:00.059
I'll have Agent Danvers
on hand.

31:00.092 --> 31:01.260
This Corben doesn't seem like
he cares

31:01.293 --> 31:03.029
who gets hurt so long as
he gets his target.

31:03.062 --> 31:04.430
Kara and I will be there, too.

31:04.463 --> 31:06.465
Don't you think
you two should talk?

31:07.466 --> 31:09.135
Apparently, you do.

31:13.139 --> 31:15.474
People think we should talk.

31:15.507 --> 31:17.043
What's there to talk about?

31:17.076 --> 31:18.945
You keep
kryptonite here, J'onn.

31:18.978 --> 31:20.179
It could kill me.
It could kill Kara.

31:20.212 --> 31:21.547
I would never let it
be used like that.

31:21.580 --> 31:23.149
I know you wouldn't.

31:23.182 --> 31:25.251
But what happens when you're
not in charge anymore?

31:25.284 --> 31:27.186
What happens if you get
an order from a superior?

31:27.219 --> 31:29.021
The President herself?

31:30.222 --> 31:31.390
As long as you have
kryptonite here,

31:31.423 --> 31:33.159
I can't be a part
of what you do.

31:40.566 --> 31:44.303
My brother's serving 32
consecutive life sentences.

31:44.336 --> 31:45.571
I guess I shouldn't
be surprised

31:45.604 --> 31:47.006
there isn't a bigger turnout.

31:47.039 --> 31:48.707
You're taking an awful risk,

31:48.740 --> 31:51.510
going ahead
with the renaming ceremony
with your life in danger.

31:51.543 --> 31:55.281
I won't have a life
if I can't make this company
into something positive.

31:55.314 --> 31:57.549
All it will be remembered
for is Lex's madness.

32:02.688 --> 32:05.057
I want to thank you all
for coming.

32:05.091 --> 32:06.959
I'm in the main plaza.

32:06.993 --> 32:08.494
No sign of Corben.

32:08.527 --> 32:12.031
My brother hurt a lot of
good, innocent people.

32:12.064 --> 32:13.432
My family owes a debt,

32:13.465 --> 32:16.435
not just to Metropolis,
but to everyone.

32:16.468 --> 32:18.037
I intend to pay that.

32:18.070 --> 32:20.306
By renaming my company L-Corp,

32:20.339 --> 32:24.010
we will usher in a new age
of cooperation and community.

32:24.043 --> 32:26.345
Together, we will chart
a brighter future.

32:27.646 --> 32:30.049
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

32:49.035 --> 32:50.202
Go!

32:57.676 --> 32:59.278
You're late.

32:59.311 --> 33:00.512
There was really bad traffic.

33:06.618 --> 33:07.786
I've got eyes on Corben.

33:17.629 --> 33:19.431
Kara, Corben
took out the southwest
retaining column.

33:19.465 --> 33:21.367
Basically, he targeted
the building's one weak spot.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.102
Just like that perfectly
placed shot

33:23.135 --> 33:24.503
to take out the Death Star.

33:24.536 --> 33:25.771
I don't need
a Star Wars reference

33:25.804 --> 33:27.406
right now, Winn.
I need a plan.

33:27.439 --> 33:30.576
If you repair the column,
the building should hold.

33:30.609 --> 33:32.478
Repair it with what?

33:35.281 --> 33:36.315
I'm going to fix the building.

33:36.348 --> 33:38.150
Go, go. I've got this.

to kill his sister, didn't he?

Luthor still has resources
and reach,

even rotting in maximum
security lockdown.

34:49.688 --> 34:50.856

through-and-through.

the kind of press

my company needs
after yesterday's attack.

35:18.717 --> 35:22.421
And thank you for
including that part about
me shooting the guy.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.356
That'll teach Lex
to mess with me.

35:24.390 --> 35:26.358
-(CHUCKLES)
-He'll be the laughingstock
of cell block X.

35:26.392 --> 35:27.859
Well, that's not exactly
why I wrote it.

35:27.893 --> 35:29.695
I wrote it because
it's the truth.

35:29.728 --> 35:31.663
I was wrong about you,
Ms. Luthor.

35:31.697 --> 35:33.865
I'm sorry.

35:33.899 --> 35:35.634
Well, if I can make a believer
out of Clark Kent,

35:35.667 --> 35:37.236
there's hope yet.

35:38.204 --> 35:40.772
What about you, Ms. Danvers?

35:40.806 --> 35:42.474
I didn't see your name
on the byline.

35:43.475 --> 35:44.676
Uh...

35:44.710 --> 35:46.612
Well, like I said,
I'm not a reporter.

35:46.645 --> 35:48.214
You could have fooled me.

35:50.782 --> 35:52.518
I hope this isn't
the last time we talk.

35:53.585 --> 35:55.153
I hope not either.

35:58.657 --> 35:59.891
Okay...

36:01.427 --> 36:02.428
I made my decision.

36:05.297 --> 36:07.433
Forty-three minutes before
the deadline.

36:07.466 --> 36:09.268
This better be good.

36:09.301 --> 36:10.736
(EXHALES)

36:10.769 --> 36:12.404
I wanna be a reporter.

36:13.805 --> 36:15.941
I can't believe
I didn't see it before.

36:15.974 --> 36:18.910
Being a reporter is about
connecting with people,

36:18.944 --> 36:23.515
it's about finding
hidden truth
and sharing it with the world.

36:23.549 --> 36:25.784
It's about service,

36:25.817 --> 36:27.953
and telling stories
that need to be told

36:27.986 --> 36:29.688
in order to make
the world a better,

36:29.721 --> 36:31.557
more comprehensible place.

36:31.590 --> 36:34.493
And it's going to make me
the best version of myself,

36:34.526 --> 36:35.927
because it will definitely

36:35.961 --> 36:38.364
push me out
of my comfort zone.

36:38.397 --> 36:41.967
This is it for me.
This is my calling.

36:43.602 --> 36:44.903
Open it.

36:47.506 --> 36:50.309
Is this my resume?

36:50.342 --> 36:52.744
The minute you came in
to interview as my assistant,

36:52.778 --> 36:54.380
I had an instinct about you.

36:54.413 --> 36:57.483
So I scribbled "reporter"
on your resume,

36:57.516 --> 36:59.985
and I stuffed it right here
in this drawer,

37:00.018 --> 37:02.854
and I hired you on the spot.

37:02.888 --> 37:05.357
-You knew even then?
-Mmm-hmm.

37:06.692 --> 37:08.594
-How?
-Instincts.

37:08.627 --> 37:11.863
And I guess I saw
a little bit of myself in you.

37:11.897 --> 37:16.268
Obviously not your
strip mall wardrobe,

37:16.302 --> 37:18.537
and I probably curse more
in one day

37:18.570 --> 37:20.872
than you've cursed
in your entire lifetime,

37:20.906 --> 37:23.275
but you have integrity

37:23.309 --> 37:26.512
to right wrongs
and to see justice done.

37:28.013 --> 37:29.981
You inspire me, Kara.

37:31.383 --> 37:33.585
I can see the hero within you.

37:35.921 --> 37:38.490
Now get out and make me proud.

37:40.759 --> 37:42.928
Thank you, Ms. Grant.

37:42.961 --> 37:48.033
You know, you do have
a really good instinct
about other people,

37:48.066 --> 37:51.403
just letting them know
how to live their best lives.

37:51.437 --> 37:55.907
Please. I'm just glad
that you decided
to take the plunge.

37:55.941 --> 37:59.945
It's actually good advice
for all of us.

38:02.681 --> 38:04.516
You sure you're okay?

38:04.550 --> 38:06.618
Uh... I will be.

38:10.889 --> 38:12.658
Ms. Tessmacher,

38:12.691 --> 38:15.394
I need you
to come in here, please. I...

38:15.427 --> 38:17.429
I need to make some calls.

38:20.766 --> 38:22.534
You know, what's funny is,

38:22.568 --> 38:24.936
on Krypton, by my age,

38:24.970 --> 38:26.672
I'd be a spinster.

38:30.976 --> 38:32.511
I know it seems like
I should have

38:32.544 --> 38:36.848
everything figured out by now,
but I don't.

38:36.882 --> 38:40.919
Last year was
all about figuring out how
to be Supergirl, and now...

38:42.388 --> 38:43.321
(SIGHS)

38:43.355 --> 38:46.091
Now it's time I figure out
how to be Kara.

38:49.928 --> 38:52.831
You were right, James.

38:52.864 --> 38:55.333
Something has changed for me.

38:56.568 --> 38:58.904
You and me together,
that's all I wanted.

38:58.937 --> 39:01.607
But now when I listen
to my heart,

39:01.640 --> 39:04.943
I just... I know that
we are best as friends.

39:08.880 --> 39:11.049
And we will always be friends.

39:14.486 --> 39:17.122
I was going to go see Clark.
You wanna come?

39:17.155 --> 39:20.125
No. (CLEARS THROAT)
Say hi for me.

39:20.959 --> 39:22.127
Okay.

39:28.166 --> 39:29.868
Welcome to the DEO,
Mr. Schott.

39:29.901 --> 39:31.670
Thank you, Hank,
or Director Henshaw.

39:31.703 --> 39:33.605
Or was it J'onn,
or Martian Manhunter?

39:33.639 --> 39:35.941
-What's the protocol here?
-"Sir" will do just fine.

39:35.974 --> 39:38.844
Yes, sir, Hank. J'onn, no...

39:38.877 --> 39:40.746
Congratulations, Winn.

39:40.779 --> 39:42.781
It's good to have you
officially on the team.

39:42.814 --> 39:44.082
Oh, I was just wondering...

39:44.115 --> 39:45.751
And this is not
a deal-breaker whatsoever,

39:45.784 --> 39:48.153
but I had a pretty sweet IRA
over at Catco.

39:48.186 --> 39:49.955
Does that transfer over here?

39:49.988 --> 39:51.557
-Or...
-(KARA LAUGHS)

39:53.759 --> 39:55.927
Doesn't bother you that I got
top credit on this one,

39:55.961 --> 39:58.129
does it?
Not even a little bit?

39:58.163 --> 39:59.998
Honestly, I've never been
more offended.

40:00.031 --> 40:01.733
-Really, I'm flying home
right now.
-(LAUGHING)

40:03.201 --> 40:05.871
No, I'm very proud
just to be working beside you.

40:05.904 --> 40:09.675
In fact, I was thinking
that I'd stick around
for a little while.

40:09.708 --> 40:10.842
-Really?
-Yeah.

40:10.876 --> 40:12.143
I didn't realize
how nice it was

40:12.177 --> 40:13.445
to be around someone like me.

40:13.479 --> 40:15.714
You know,
just to be with family.

40:15.747 --> 40:17.182
Me, too.

40:17.215 --> 40:20.519
And I know everything
there is to know about Krypton

40:20.552 --> 40:22.554
from the archives
in the Fortress.

40:22.588 --> 40:26.758
But I really like it
when you tell me stories
about home.

40:27.659 --> 40:29.160
You make it real.

40:29.194 --> 40:32.498
So, maybe while I'm here,

40:32.531 --> 40:33.965
you can tell me some more
about my parents.

40:33.999 --> 40:36.635
Of course.
I would love nothing more.

40:36.668 --> 40:37.569
Good.

40:37.603 --> 40:39.638
Hey, I'm not sure
if you're interested,

40:39.671 --> 40:42.974
but there is an armored car
robbery on Sixth and Stagg.

40:44.242 --> 40:45.811
-Up, up?
-And away.

40:59.090 --> 41:01.627
You're not in a hospital,
Mr. Corben.

41:01.660 --> 41:02.728
It's just as well.

41:02.761 --> 41:05.731
All they could do for you
there is watch you die.

41:05.764 --> 41:06.598
Whereas here with me,

41:06.632 --> 41:09.134
you have a chance
at continued life.

41:09.968 --> 41:11.136
I press the red button,

41:11.169 --> 41:13.138
and your ventilator
shuts down.

41:13.171 --> 41:15.040
The pain will end,
and you'll drift off

41:15.073 --> 41:18.677
to whatever afterlife
you believe in.

41:18.710 --> 41:21.012
But if I press
the green button,

41:21.046 --> 41:23.214
I can promise you life.

41:23.248 --> 41:25.784
Blink once
if you want to live.

41:27.653 --> 41:30.789
Good choice.
Welcome to Cadmus.

41:38.263 --> 41:40.799
John Corben dies today.

41:42.033 --> 41:44.770
Long live Metallo.
