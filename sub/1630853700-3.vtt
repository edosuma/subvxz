WEBVTT

00:01.392 --> 00:02.524
- The community might be
drying out, but this stuff's

00:02.567 --> 00:04.134
coming up, whether you like it
or not.

00:04.178 --> 00:05.614
If having a whisky pipeline
gives me the tools

00:05.657 --> 00:06.745
to bring up the stuff
we actually need,

00:06.789 --> 00:07.877
well fine with me.

00:07.920 --> 00:09.400
- When do we lose you
to Air Canada?

00:09.444 --> 00:10.836
- Not for a few months, sir.

00:10.880 --> 00:12.795
- Mr. Golden Boy
didn't get the job.

00:12.838 --> 00:14.057
- So I guess it wasn't safe

00:14.101 --> 00:16.059
to hook up with a co-worker
after all, huh?

00:16.103 --> 00:18.105
- I think we work together
pretty good.

00:18.931 --> 00:20.542
- You're out dancing
with some random

00:20.585 --> 00:23.110
while I'm freaking out,
knocked up with your baby!

00:23.153 --> 00:24.459
- The Aviation Authority,

00:24.502 --> 00:25.677
they're sending a team up
next week

00:25.721 --> 00:27.375
to interview me about the crash.

00:27.418 --> 00:30.030
They're mighty determined
to find out what happened.

00:33.337 --> 00:35.078
- We've been walking
for 40 minutes now.

00:35.122 --> 00:36.384
- Just a little further...

00:36.427 --> 00:37.733
- You said that half
an hour ago!

00:39.865 --> 00:42.346
You dragged me all the way
through the woods for this?

00:42.390 --> 00:43.652
- Once we take down a few trees,

00:43.695 --> 00:45.523
you'll get a view of the lake.

00:45.567 --> 00:48.091
- What is this?
A mid-life crisis?

00:48.135 --> 00:49.745
Are you trying to have another
heart attack?

00:49.788 --> 00:52.008
If you wanted a cottage,
just buy a place in Gimli.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.096
[scoffs]

00:56.752 --> 00:58.014
[grunting]

01:05.543 --> 01:08.068
Jesus Christ. Do you have
any idea what you're doing?!

01:10.287 --> 01:11.114
[revving]

01:12.289 --> 01:14.117
[phone beeping]
Ah! There's no signal!

01:14.161 --> 01:15.553
- How much further?

01:15.597 --> 01:17.338
- You're the one who wanted
a cabin all the way...

01:17.381 --> 01:18.948
[screaming in pain]

01:20.906 --> 01:23.083
- My leg!
- My ankle!

01:24.301 --> 01:26.390
[phone beeping]

01:26.434 --> 01:28.262
- You've lost a lot
of blood,

01:28.305 --> 01:30.090
but you missed
the femoral artery.

01:30.133 --> 01:31.613
- We'll need to splint
this ankle.

01:31.656 --> 01:33.745
- This is all his fault.
- Generators.

01:33.789 --> 01:35.095
- Just like your mother,
holding a grudge.

01:35.138 --> 01:36.661
- On, and checked.
- Were we supposed to be

01:36.705 --> 01:38.359
cool with you just leaving
when I was 10?

01:38.402 --> 01:40.361
- I know I screwed up.
But I've been trying

01:40.404 --> 01:42.972
to make up for it.
- Patients onboard?

01:43.015 --> 01:45.235
- Right, since your heart attack
made you scared you'd die alone.

01:46.062 --> 01:47.716
[both]: Check.
- How long are you going

01:47.759 --> 01:49.065
to make me pay for this?!
- Enough!

01:49.109 --> 01:51.067
I've got two shots
of tramadol,

01:51.111 --> 01:52.895
and neither of you is getting
one unless you shut up

01:52.938 --> 01:54.853
so the pilots can hear
themselves think!

01:55.289 --> 01:57.334
You, stay away from power tools.

01:57.378 --> 02:00.163
And you. Give people
a chance to change.

02:00.207 --> 02:01.382
Got it?

02:03.427 --> 02:06.387
[indistinct radio chatter]

02:08.258 --> 02:10.304
- Know any cottages
for sale in Gimli?

02:11.218 --> 02:14.656
[engine powering up]

02:20.009 --> 02:21.880
- Oh no, my practicum!
Can you take it from here?

02:21.924 --> 02:22.881
I'm already late.

02:25.710 --> 02:28.670
- Whoa. Um, sorry.

02:29.366 --> 02:30.976
Burning the candle
at both ends?

02:32.152 --> 02:33.849
- Wouldn't have
it any other way.

02:37.331 --> 02:40.856
[theme music]

02:49.081 --> 02:51.606
- Oh! Oh my god, Flipper!?

02:51.649 --> 02:54.913
- Wow. Tyra.
No one calls me that anymore.

02:54.957 --> 02:56.785
- I haven't seen you since
high school.

02:56.828 --> 02:58.656
Man, I can't believe
you're a nurse!

02:58.700 --> 03:00.092
- Yeah.

03:00.136 --> 03:01.964
Uh, I'm just gonna take
a look here, okay?

03:03.661 --> 03:05.794
The doctor will have to confirm,

03:05.837 --> 03:07.448
but you're going
to need stitches.

03:07.491 --> 03:09.319
And your nose
is definitely broken.

03:11.103 --> 03:12.975
- Remember that time
we went canoeing

03:13.018 --> 03:14.803
and we got so drunk
we passed out?

03:14.846 --> 03:18.720
We floated for hours until
we hit a rock and tipped.

03:19.938 --> 03:21.636
[in NÃªhiyawwin]

03:23.638 --> 03:25.683
- You're going to need surgery
to reset your nose,

03:25.727 --> 03:26.989
but we have to wait
for the swelling

03:27.032 --> 03:28.643
to come down first, okay?

03:28.686 --> 03:29.905
- Ugh. So dumb...

03:30.340 --> 03:32.473
I fell off my front step
and did a face plant.

03:33.343 --> 03:35.258
I don't party anymore, Crys.

03:35.302 --> 03:37.739
I was going to a job interview,

03:37.782 --> 03:41.133
and I went to reach for the
railing, it just wasn't there.

03:42.265 --> 03:43.571
- Tyra Makokis?

03:44.485 --> 03:46.313
- This is Tyra.
Facial laceration

03:46.356 --> 03:48.315
and she'll need a nasal
fracture reduction.

03:48.358 --> 03:49.968
- You did a number.

03:50.012 --> 03:51.622
Let's send her to Winnipeg
for the surgery

03:51.666 --> 03:53.363
so Plastics can consult
on the cut.

03:53.407 --> 03:55.017
Can't mess around with
a face that pretty.

03:55.670 --> 03:57.324
- What did you say
your name was?

03:57.367 --> 04:00.544
- Doctor Sung. I'll call for
a non-urgent medevac,

04:00.588 --> 04:02.677
I think the next available slot
is tomorrow.

04:02.720 --> 04:04.853
- This woman's gonna put me out
of a job, Tyra.

04:04.896 --> 04:06.289
Soon as she gets back
from med school.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.204
- You're going to med school,
Flip?!

04:08.248 --> 04:10.902
- No, no. I mean,
I haven't even applied yet.

04:10.946 --> 04:12.991
I just haven't had time.

04:13.688 --> 04:16.430
- Wow! Who would've guessed,
in grade 10.

04:16.473 --> 04:17.953
You know why we call her
Flipper?

04:17.996 --> 04:19.781
- You know, Dr. Sung has a lot
of other patients--

04:19.824 --> 04:22.697
- No, but I bet I want to.
- She used to be wild.

04:22.740 --> 04:26.004
I mean, they called me
Trainwreck Tyra, but this girl?

04:26.527 --> 04:28.485
- Yep, that's the whole story.

04:28.529 --> 04:31.314
- One day, she was so pissed
at our teacher for giving her

04:31.358 --> 04:33.664
shit for skipping class
that she went to his place

04:33.708 --> 04:35.710
and flipped his outhouse.

04:36.798 --> 04:39.061
While he was in it!

04:39.104 --> 04:41.324
- Uh, that's impressive.
And terrifying.

04:42.673 --> 04:44.066
- Hey, are you still
with Jeremy?

04:44.109 --> 04:46.068
- No.
- Oh...

04:48.200 --> 04:49.332
Oh!

04:50.333 --> 04:51.421
Nice one, Flip.

04:51.465 --> 04:53.336
- I'll go get Tyra a bed
for the night.

04:58.167 --> 04:59.299
- This is my job, Tyra.

05:00.604 --> 05:02.171
Not a high school reunion.

05:09.439 --> 05:11.049
- What do you want?

05:11.093 --> 05:13.008
- Look, the other night when
I found out you were pregnant,

05:13.051 --> 05:15.402
I freaked out.
- Yeah, no shit.

05:15.445 --> 05:16.838
- I just...

05:17.404 --> 05:18.796
I wasn't ready to deal.

05:20.145 --> 05:21.756
- Some of us didn't have
that choice.

05:21.799 --> 05:23.410
- I want to make it right, Mads.

05:23.453 --> 05:26.456
I know I didn't get the AC job,
but I'm applying to West Jet.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.240
I'll have a better check,

05:28.284 --> 05:29.590
I can send you money.

05:29.633 --> 05:31.505
- You're gonna send me money?
While you what?

05:31.548 --> 05:33.158
Just take off to Calgary?
[scoffs]

05:34.029 --> 05:35.726
- Mads!
- We were together

05:35.770 --> 05:36.814
for more than a year.

05:36.858 --> 05:38.425
That time we hiked
to the waterfall

05:38.468 --> 05:40.383
and we slept under the stars,

05:40.427 --> 05:42.690
you said being with me
was like home.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.128
That means something, Bodie.

05:46.171 --> 05:48.348
And now you're just gonna act
like it doesn't?

05:49.827 --> 05:50.959
- Things change.

05:51.002 --> 05:52.047
- Do they?

05:54.354 --> 05:55.616
Or are you just afraid?

05:56.399 --> 05:58.183
When you thought you got
that job in Toronto,

05:58.227 --> 05:59.968
I think you broke up with me

06:00.011 --> 06:01.448
because if I moved
there with you,

06:01.491 --> 06:03.101
it would make things real.

06:03.972 --> 06:05.843
You can't handle real.

06:07.845 --> 06:09.847
You just want to be free to fly.

06:09.891 --> 06:12.459
[soft music]

06:16.463 --> 06:17.638
- Mads!

06:24.253 --> 06:27.474
[rhythmic music]

06:30.999 --> 06:34.568
- Hey, you guys want tomatoes
on your sandwiches?

06:34.611 --> 06:35.917
- Does that even count
as a tomato?

06:35.960 --> 06:37.701
- Hey, watch it,
or you won't get lettuce.

06:37.745 --> 06:39.573
- Why do we need sandwiches now?

06:39.616 --> 06:41.226
- When you're working
on your night shift tonight,

06:41.270 --> 06:42.358
you'll be glad you had
a sandwich

06:42.402 --> 06:43.446
and a nap when you could.

06:44.534 --> 06:45.579
Oh, hey Chops.

06:45.622 --> 06:47.494
- Hey.
- A mechanic in the 'peg

06:47.537 --> 06:48.843
said you were looking
for one of those?

06:51.280 --> 06:53.543
- Yes! I can finish my CB radio.

06:56.677 --> 06:58.243
It's the internet of the north.

06:59.984 --> 07:01.421
- You could shave in those.

07:01.464 --> 07:03.684
- That why you got all those
nicks on your ugly mug?

07:04.249 --> 07:06.034
Should've used pantyhose
on your final spit polish.

07:06.077 --> 07:08.123
- Oh god.
Now there's two of him.

07:08.166 --> 07:09.690
- I look better
in a flight suit, right?

07:11.082 --> 07:12.432
- It's a tie.

07:16.087 --> 07:18.220
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
When did that start happening?

07:18.263 --> 07:19.526
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

07:19.569 --> 07:22.485
- He's cute.
Does he know you...

07:22.529 --> 07:24.269
- Still, no idea
what you're talking about.

07:24.313 --> 07:26.010
- Uh huh.

07:26.054 --> 07:27.751
Whatever you say, cheekbones.

07:30.885 --> 07:32.974
- Nina is an 18-year-old girl,
had a seizure

07:33.017 --> 07:35.716
watching a game at
the local baseball diamond.

07:35.759 --> 07:40.155
Here's her patient history
and copy of her ID.

07:40.938 --> 07:44.376
She'll need a CT, so we can
figure out what caused it.

07:44.420 --> 07:46.422
- Nina Sharpe?
- That's me.

07:47.118 --> 07:49.251
- You don't have anyone
travelling with you today?

07:49.294 --> 07:51.558
- Parents are out of town
and she's 18,

07:51.601 --> 07:53.081
so she's good to go.

07:53.124 --> 07:55.953
I know. The older I get,
the younger they seem to me too.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.654
- So, are you
a big baseball fan?

08:01.568 --> 08:02.612
- Not really.

08:02.656 --> 08:05.093
Just... something to do.

08:05.136 --> 08:06.660
- Seizures can be scary.

08:07.443 --> 08:09.097
It's normal to feel disoriented

08:09.140 --> 08:10.838
or even a little
emotional after.

08:13.318 --> 08:14.189
[sighs]

08:15.320 --> 08:16.104
Do you want to listen
to the pilots?

08:17.714 --> 08:20.500
Lexi's really good at pointing
out cool things to look at.

08:22.327 --> 08:24.765
- Ready to brief the approach?
- Roll it.

08:24.808 --> 08:26.723
- We're doing the ILS approach
for runway zero-six

08:26.767 --> 08:29.596
in Thompson, page 11-1...
-Aren't we going to Winnipeg?

08:29.639 --> 08:31.946
- There's a CT scanner
in Thompson.

08:31.989 --> 08:33.164
And since you're stable--

08:33.208 --> 08:34.905
- No! No, no.

08:34.949 --> 08:36.167
My chest hurts.

08:36.646 --> 08:39.823
And... the right side
of my body is numb.

08:39.867 --> 08:42.434
I think I need to see
a specialist, in Winnipeg.

08:48.049 --> 08:50.573
- Based on what you're saying,
I think I know what's going on.

08:56.536 --> 08:57.885
You're not Nina Sharpe.

08:57.928 --> 09:00.191
Nina had a ganglion removed
two years ago.

09:00.235 --> 09:01.497
And you don't have a scar.

09:02.193 --> 09:03.543
- Nina's my older sister.

09:05.457 --> 09:06.546
I'm Erin.

09:09.026 --> 09:10.637
- And how old are you, Erin?

09:12.116 --> 09:13.030
- 15.

09:15.163 --> 09:18.645
- So what? You stole your older
sister's ID and faked a seizure

09:18.688 --> 09:20.560
to go on a joy-ride alone
to Winnipeg?

09:25.216 --> 09:27.479
Call Dispatch. False alarm.

09:27.523 --> 09:30.221
- Dispatch, this is 922.
Patient is a false alarm,

09:30.265 --> 09:32.223
approval to re-route back
to Windy Lake?

09:32.267 --> 09:35.096
[dispatch]: 922, if you're not
carrying on to Thompson,

09:35.139 --> 09:36.967
there's a patient requiring
immediate evac

09:37.011 --> 09:39.013
for acute abdominal pain
at Prospect River.

09:39.056 --> 09:41.668
Sounds like appendicitis.
Are you able?

09:41.711 --> 09:44.409
- Affirmative Dispatch,
re-routing now.

09:44.453 --> 09:47.978
- Alright. Let's go.
You're a passenger now.

09:50.894 --> 09:52.374
- Is she going to be okay?

09:52.417 --> 09:54.594
- She will be if we get her
in an OR before she perfs.

09:54.637 --> 09:56.378
But given the detour we took
on the way here,

09:56.421 --> 09:58.075
it'll be touch and go.

09:59.207 --> 10:01.209
[intense music]

10:03.994 --> 10:06.562
Rachel, I'm gonna give you
something for the pain, okay?

10:06.606 --> 10:07.955
We'll be in Winnipeg soon.

10:17.268 --> 10:19.488
- I wasn't just faking for fun.

10:20.924 --> 10:22.534
My best friend is dying.

10:23.710 --> 10:24.580
Sabrina.

10:25.233 --> 10:26.451
She has leukemia.

10:27.278 --> 10:29.106
And she's in Winnipeg
getting chemo.

10:29.803 --> 10:31.152
She's been there for months.

10:31.761 --> 10:33.371
And our parents won't tell us
anything,

10:33.415 --> 10:35.809
because they don't think
we can handle it,

10:35.852 --> 10:39.073
but I know that if I don't get
to see Sabrina now,

10:39.116 --> 10:40.552
I might never see her again.

10:46.602 --> 10:47.647
- I'm sorry.

10:49.953 --> 10:51.085
I didn't realize.

10:53.348 --> 10:54.523
- That's from before.

10:56.003 --> 10:57.482
She had such pretty hair...

10:57.874 --> 11:00.529
[soft music]

11:04.446 --> 11:05.839
- If I take you back home,

11:06.622 --> 11:07.884
you're just going
to find another way

11:07.928 --> 11:08.929
to see her, aren't you?

11:10.104 --> 11:11.322
- She'd do it for me.

11:16.937 --> 11:18.460
- I duty out after this.

11:19.156 --> 11:21.028
And we'll already be
in Winnipeg.

11:22.464 --> 11:24.292
I can take you to go see
Sabrina.

11:24.335 --> 11:27.599
If you promise to call
your parents on the way.

11:27.643 --> 11:29.471
- Yeah. Yes.

11:31.952 --> 11:37.435
[âª]

11:52.059 --> 11:54.801
- He bought a plane ticket
just to get through security

11:54.844 --> 11:56.672
to tell me that he loved me.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.326
That's when I knew
he was the one.

11:58.369 --> 11:59.849
[woman on radio]:
That's so romantic, Bride007.

11:59.893 --> 12:01.285
Jeff would never do that.

12:01.329 --> 12:03.723
- Oh yeah, Devon's all about
the big gestures.

12:05.289 --> 12:08.597
Well, I mean, that was
before med school.

12:08.640 --> 12:11.339
Now he's all about studying
and forgetting to eat.

12:11.382 --> 12:13.167
We haven't even been able to get
on the phone together

12:13.210 --> 12:15.517
so he doesn't even know about
the location that I chose.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.519
- That cute little barn
in Pickering?

12:17.562 --> 12:18.912
It's right out of a magazine!

12:18.955 --> 12:20.696
[man on radio]: Whoa,
whoa, whoa.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.699
A barn? What is this, 2009?

12:23.743 --> 12:25.701
If you're getting married
in Toronto,

12:25.745 --> 12:27.529
Bride007, do it right.

12:27.572 --> 12:31.098
The rooftop at the Broadview,
or the Brickworks...

12:31.141 --> 12:34.797
I didn't mean to eavesdrop,
but I have sisters.

12:34.841 --> 12:36.364
- Who is this?

12:36.407 --> 12:39.149
- Um, Orion24.

12:41.891 --> 12:43.110
- Well, Orion.

12:45.068 --> 12:47.767
Since you're a guy and
my future hubby's currently

12:47.810 --> 12:49.594
elbows deep in cadaver lab,

12:49.638 --> 12:51.292
what are your thoughts on tuxes?

12:52.075 --> 12:54.251
Classy, or done?

12:54.295 --> 12:56.340
[chuckling]

12:56.384 --> 12:58.734
[Orion24]: Yeah.
Definitely go with suits.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.518
Three piece.

13:00.562 --> 13:02.433
And none of that
bowtie nonsense either.

13:02.477 --> 13:04.261
[phone ringing]
- That's work.

13:04.305 --> 13:05.480
Find you later, Orion.

13:06.176 --> 13:08.744
[rhythmic music]

13:15.620 --> 13:16.883
- Thanks for coming, Emma.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.189
- Any nausea?

13:19.233 --> 13:21.409
- I haven't been able
to eat all day.

13:21.452 --> 13:24.020
Between that,
and the chest pain...

13:24.064 --> 13:26.457
Feels like it's going right up
into my neck.

13:27.241 --> 13:28.808
I tell you about Kara?

13:28.851 --> 13:31.332
Just started freshman year
at U of M.

13:31.375 --> 13:34.074
- What's she studying again?
- Marketing.

13:34.117 --> 13:36.816
- Okay, okay. Just breathe.
Nice and slow.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.254
It's definitely cardiac.

13:40.297 --> 13:42.212
I'll grab some nitroglycerine
from the truck, okay?

13:44.867 --> 13:45.999
[growling]

13:46.042 --> 13:48.218
[intense music]

13:56.009 --> 13:58.620
[growling]

14:01.666 --> 14:02.537
Nice wolfie...

14:03.581 --> 14:05.670
I just have to get to my truck.

14:07.890 --> 14:09.370
[snarling]

14:11.502 --> 14:13.330
They did not cover this
in nursing school.

14:19.249 --> 14:22.252
- Did you get the medication?
My chest hurts something awful.

14:22.296 --> 14:23.558
- There's a wolf out front.

14:23.601 --> 14:25.995
I can't get to my truck,
he won't leave.

14:26.039 --> 14:28.519
- I skinned a deer outside
this morning, he must smell it.

14:28.563 --> 14:30.521
- Okay, it's okay.

14:30.565 --> 14:32.828
I'll just use my SAT phone
to call someone for help.

14:34.699 --> 14:36.876
Shit! I must've left it
in my truck as well.

14:36.919 --> 14:38.878
Can I use yours?
- Disconnected.

14:38.921 --> 14:41.706
I sent the phone money to Kara
to pay for her textbooks.

14:41.750 --> 14:43.621
But I do have a neighbour
that lets me use hers.

14:43.665 --> 14:46.233
- I can't get to the neighbour,
I can't even get to my truck.

14:46.276 --> 14:47.712
[wolf howling]

14:55.546 --> 14:58.593
This is Bride007.
Is anyone there? I need help!

14:59.376 --> 15:00.987
Hello? Anyone there?

15:01.030 --> 15:02.510
- This is Orion24,
everything alright?

15:02.553 --> 15:04.947
- No! I need to get
to my truck but there's

15:04.991 --> 15:07.036
a freaking wolf outside.
- Well, he's probably

15:07.080 --> 15:08.559
more scared of you
than you are of him.

15:08.603 --> 15:09.909
If you make a loud noise, or --

15:09.952 --> 15:11.432
- There's food outside,
he won't budge.

15:12.476 --> 15:14.957
How you holding up?
- I've been better, Emma.

15:16.350 --> 15:18.569
- I really need to get
to my truck.

15:18.613 --> 15:20.963
- We just need a way
to scare him off.

15:21.572 --> 15:23.139
You need a bear bang!

15:23.183 --> 15:25.446
- A what?
- Sorry, no, it's...

15:25.489 --> 15:28.101
Hikers carry them.
To scare off bears.

15:28.144 --> 15:29.580
What have you got to make
a flare with?

15:29.624 --> 15:31.321
- I have a lip gloss,
flashlight and keys.

15:31.365 --> 15:32.844
- I need you to take apart
the flashlight,

15:32.888 --> 15:34.716
find some aluminum foil...

15:34.759 --> 15:36.283
What have you got
for cleaning supplies?

15:36.326 --> 15:37.588
-Under the sink.

15:40.156 --> 15:42.028
- Well, if you think
of anything, in the long run,

15:42.071 --> 15:43.116
it's for everyone's safety.

15:43.159 --> 15:44.465
- Oh! I'll come back
another time.

15:44.508 --> 15:47.076
- I was just leaving.
Austen Bodie, right?

15:47.990 --> 15:49.383
You saved William's life.

15:50.297 --> 15:52.473
Lauren Dumont,
with the Aviation Authority.

15:52.516 --> 15:55.041
I'll be coming by the hangar
to speak with you and your crew.

16:00.437 --> 16:02.570
[sighs]
- Regulatory bullshit.

16:02.613 --> 16:04.006
Trying to figure out
what happened in the crash.

16:04.050 --> 16:05.355
But joke's on him,

16:05.399 --> 16:07.575
because I can't remember
what happened right before

16:07.618 --> 16:09.316
or after the accident.
[chuckling]

16:09.969 --> 16:11.579
Just one more surgery
and I'm good to go.

16:11.622 --> 16:13.015
Hey, that better be for me.

16:13.798 --> 16:15.887
- Yes, sir.
Nintendo Switch.

16:15.931 --> 16:18.194
I figured, if you're going
to sit on your ass,

16:19.021 --> 16:20.805
we might as well work
on your Mario Kart.

16:20.849 --> 16:22.285
- Should probably work
on my physio, but...

16:22.329 --> 16:23.983
How did things go with Madison?

16:26.072 --> 16:29.379
Oh, Boderton.
What did you do?

16:30.076 --> 16:31.860
- I told Madison
I was leaving Thompson.

16:31.903 --> 16:33.644
I said I'd send her money,
but...

16:34.428 --> 16:36.560
She says I'm afraid.
- Yeah, you are.

16:36.604 --> 16:38.519
So are most guys.
- Dude, we were broken up.

16:38.562 --> 16:40.782
What, are we just supposed
to get back together

16:40.825 --> 16:42.349
because she's pregnant?
- There's a reason

16:42.392 --> 16:43.959
that you guys dated for so long.
Right?

16:44.003 --> 16:45.308
There was something good
between you.

16:45.352 --> 16:47.223
And if there was ever a reason
to put the effort

16:47.267 --> 16:48.572
into a relationship--
- I can't...

16:49.399 --> 16:51.488
I can't be someone's dad,
Wheezer.

16:53.882 --> 16:56.450
- Well, that horse has already
left the stable, bud.

17:00.715 --> 17:02.673
When Lynn got pregnant...

17:04.501 --> 17:06.895
Caleb, he's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.987
Could be good for you too,
Bodie.

17:14.990 --> 17:17.166
[intense music]

17:17.210 --> 17:19.125
- What if I blow my fingers off?

17:19.168 --> 17:21.127
[Orion24]: You can
wear gloves to the wedding.

17:21.170 --> 17:24.130
Hey, look, I built this CB radio
from scratch.

17:24.173 --> 17:25.870
Trust me, okay?
You're just causing

17:25.914 --> 17:28.090
a small chemical reaction
that'll make a big noise.

17:28.134 --> 17:29.700
Totally safe.

17:29.744 --> 17:31.093
- How do you know this stuff?

17:31.137 --> 17:33.356
- I had to study
Reactions Engineering

17:33.400 --> 17:35.793
when I did my degree.
This will absolutely work.

17:37.099 --> 17:39.145
[suspenseful music]

17:42.974 --> 17:44.541
[loud bang]

17:46.108 --> 17:48.458
[intense music]

17:50.286 --> 17:53.028
- Orion, it worked!
I got to my truck.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.508
- Great to hear it, Bride.

17:55.509 --> 17:56.988
[grunting]

18:05.432 --> 18:07.651
- Hey, it's okay.

18:16.182 --> 18:18.097
- Why did you do this for me?

18:19.750 --> 18:21.143
- My mom died of cancer.

18:21.970 --> 18:23.145
- I was surprised you called.

18:23.189 --> 18:24.581
- Don't read anything into it.

18:24.625 --> 18:26.540
We needed a lift home,
and I knew you were off tonight.

18:26.583 --> 18:28.237
- You can sit in the back there.

18:28.281 --> 18:30.805
Look, Madison and I were
broken up. When you and I...

18:31.284 --> 18:32.589
we weren't together then.

18:32.633 --> 18:34.548
And I didn't know about
the baby until after.

18:34.591 --> 18:36.419
I thought you should know.

18:36.463 --> 18:37.507
- Thanks.

18:37.551 --> 18:39.074
- Look, when you and I
first met,

18:39.118 --> 18:40.771
I just really felt like
I could talk to you.

18:41.381 --> 18:42.730
Like we clicked.

18:47.300 --> 18:48.997
- I think it's best
if we just keep things

18:49.040 --> 18:50.390
professional between us.

18:53.610 --> 18:57.484
[âª]

19:01.444 --> 19:03.838
- Got you a sandwich from
the diner next door.

19:04.665 --> 19:07.015
The food in here sucks.
- Leave it.

19:07.058 --> 19:09.539
Wouldn't want to embarrass you
in front of your coworkers.

19:11.454 --> 19:13.456
- No one here knows
about my past.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.066
I'm not that person anymore,
you know?

19:15.850 --> 19:17.156
- And you can't have
"Trainwreck Tyra"

19:17.199 --> 19:18.505
making you look bad.

19:20.942 --> 19:23.031
- I don't exactly need the help.

19:23.988 --> 19:25.947
I flashed a doctor this morning.

19:27.209 --> 19:28.428
- Hottie doctor?

19:29.255 --> 19:30.647
Was he into it?

19:30.691 --> 19:31.648
- Practically swallowed
his own tongue.

19:31.692 --> 19:34.085
[laughing]

19:34.999 --> 19:36.087
[sighs]

19:38.351 --> 19:40.483
[in NÃªhiyawwin]

19:44.270 --> 19:46.097
- I had a job interview today,

19:47.229 --> 19:49.231
because I got fired
from my last one.

19:50.189 --> 19:53.148
I was working for an accountant,
and I guess I was over-tired,

19:53.192 --> 19:56.238
because the numbers they just...
got all mixed up in my head.

19:58.284 --> 20:00.068
This kind of thing's been
happening a lot lately.

20:01.939 --> 20:03.985
I worked so hard to turn
my life around, you know?

20:05.508 --> 20:07.249
And it's just turning
to crap again.

20:10.121 --> 20:11.775
- I mean, it could be worse.

20:12.776 --> 20:15.475
You could be Mr. Davis
in a upside-down shithouse.

20:15.518 --> 20:16.737
[laughing]

20:19.522 --> 20:20.567
- Give me that.

20:22.351 --> 20:24.179
- You should've seen that
wolf's furry little face.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.746
Take that, White Fang!

20:25.789 --> 20:27.226
[Orion24]: Not bad
for a first time engineer.

20:27.269 --> 20:28.662
- Are you kidding?

20:28.705 --> 20:30.707
That's gonna be my new
party trick for everything.

20:30.751 --> 20:32.448
- Wedding pyrotechnics?

20:34.581 --> 20:37.366
[sighs]
- For a minute there...

20:37.410 --> 20:39.150
I kind of forgot about
the wedding.

20:41.762 --> 20:42.806
Is that a bad thing?

20:44.460 --> 20:45.331
- Maybe you needed a break
from thinking about it.

20:46.549 --> 20:48.377
- It's normal to wonder, right?

20:48.421 --> 20:50.118
Like, what if I get this wrong?

20:51.337 --> 20:53.817
- I was married.
Before I came up here.

20:54.427 --> 20:56.472
Don't get married in a barn.

20:57.473 --> 20:58.953
- What went wrong?

21:00.781 --> 21:02.043
- Where are you right now?

21:02.086 --> 21:04.785
- On a dirt road
in the middle of nowhere. Why?

21:04.828 --> 21:06.874
- Are you somewhere
where you can stop the truck?

21:06.917 --> 21:09.093
- Um, I think I've had
my fill of nature for tonight.

21:09.137 --> 21:10.921
What if that wolf's been
following me for revenge?

21:10.965 --> 21:12.967
- It'll only take a minute,
I promise.

21:20.801 --> 21:22.846
[insects chirping]

21:22.890 --> 21:24.108
- Now, look up.

21:26.110 --> 21:27.329
Do you see the pleiades?

21:29.592 --> 21:31.028
It's a seven star constellation,

21:31.072 --> 21:32.595
in the shape of a pot
with a handle...

21:33.466 --> 21:34.597
- Yeah, I see them.

21:35.903 --> 21:36.947
- You want to know
something crazy?

21:36.991 --> 21:38.558
I want to be an astronaut.

21:39.341 --> 21:41.778
- Isn't that every kid's dream?
- I'm talking about now.

21:42.910 --> 21:44.607
I want to be up there someday.

21:44.651 --> 21:45.956
Is that nuts?

21:47.915 --> 21:49.177
- I think I get it.

21:50.657 --> 21:52.049
- When I look up at them,
I feel like...

21:52.833 --> 21:54.182
There are no mistakes.

21:54.965 --> 21:57.968
So, no matter what you do,
Bride007,

21:58.012 --> 22:00.406
you'll be exactly where
you're supposed to be.

22:00.449 --> 22:02.886
[soft music]

22:10.503 --> 22:11.852
[yawning]

22:11.895 --> 22:13.810
- How's that sandwich and a nap
treating you now?

22:13.854 --> 22:16.335
- Wish I'd had two. Of each.

22:16.378 --> 22:17.248
- I got you.

22:18.206 --> 22:19.381
- Thanks.

22:21.035 --> 22:23.211
You know who makes
a great sandwich?

22:24.343 --> 22:25.953
Nowak.

22:25.996 --> 22:27.868
- Oh yeah? What's your secret?

22:28.825 --> 22:30.087
- Bread.

22:30.523 --> 22:32.394
[phone ringing]

22:35.223 --> 22:36.355
- 922.

22:37.530 --> 22:39.183
Whoa, slow down, Camille.

22:39.227 --> 22:40.750
A fisherman caught what?

22:40.794 --> 22:42.230
- First, I thought it was
a really big bass.

22:42.273 --> 22:44.972
And then I thought,
maybe some driftwood?

22:45.625 --> 22:47.409
Never seen anything like it.
- Is it really cold enough

22:47.453 --> 22:49.193
in the lakes already
to cause hypothermia?

22:49.237 --> 22:51.195
- It's been below zero at night.

22:51.239 --> 22:52.632
If he was down there
long enough...

22:53.415 --> 22:54.764
- It was raining.
It's always raining.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.114
- We'll get some heat packs
on him,

22:57.158 --> 22:58.855
warm him up slowly
on the way to Thompson.

22:58.899 --> 23:00.988
- Wonder why he just didn't
come up, if he was cold.

23:01.031 --> 23:02.381
What was he doing
down there anyway?

23:02.424 --> 23:04.426
- Alice, can you hear me?
You're close.

23:04.470 --> 23:05.993
- Looking for Alice, I guess.

23:06.036 --> 23:08.125
- Hypothermia can
cause confusion.

23:09.910 --> 23:12.260
- Oh no. He's having a seizure.

23:12.303 --> 23:14.088
Camille, draw some midazolam.

23:16.264 --> 23:17.744
- Does this happen
with hypothermia?

23:17.787 --> 23:19.354
- No. Neither does pruritus...

23:21.443 --> 23:23.924
It's not hypothermia,
it's decompression sickness.

23:23.967 --> 23:25.447
- The bends?

23:25.491 --> 23:26.492
- It's uncommon
in shallow water.

23:26.535 --> 23:28.058
Unless he was diving repeatedly

23:28.102 --> 23:29.669
too close together.
- Can you help him?

23:29.712 --> 23:32.367
- The Air Force has a hyperbaric
chamber at Winnipeg Airport.

23:32.411 --> 23:34.238
- Let's go
- Nowak.

23:34.282 --> 23:36.458
He needs to maintain the exact
same atmospheric pressure,

23:36.502 --> 23:38.155
or he'll get an embolism
and die.

23:39.113 --> 23:40.506
- Holding steady at 16,000.

23:41.507 --> 23:43.422
Keeping cabin pressure
at sea level.

23:48.122 --> 23:49.689
- What... Where am I?

23:50.211 --> 23:51.430
What's happening?

23:51.473 --> 23:53.388
- Easy, easy.
You need to lay back.

23:53.432 --> 23:55.129
You have the bends.

23:55.172 --> 23:56.435
- I had to keep diving...

23:56.478 --> 23:58.175
before they could figure out
what I was up to.

23:58.741 --> 24:01.048
- What were you up to?
- I work for the dam.

24:01.091 --> 24:03.790
They're manipulating the water
flow beyond the guidelines.

24:04.921 --> 24:05.966
Kills the fish.

24:07.228 --> 24:09.012
The communities rely
on the lake for food.

24:09.056 --> 24:10.666
I was trying to get proof...

24:11.232 --> 24:13.103
- And you didn't take any breaks
between dives.

24:13.147 --> 24:15.802
- I had to stop them before
it was too late to reverse...

24:15.845 --> 24:17.499
- Find what you needed?

24:17.543 --> 24:20.763
- My bag... My bag!
- Hey, easy, easy. Relax.

24:20.807 --> 24:22.809
Relax, I got it, I got it.

24:23.723 --> 24:24.854
Here you go.

24:29.163 --> 24:32.296
- I need to call my lawyer,
the authorities.

24:32.340 --> 24:35.517
- Let's get you stable, first.
Alright?

24:37.737 --> 24:39.869
[intense music]

24:39.913 --> 24:41.349
- Turning on the ice lights.

24:45.962 --> 24:48.487
We're picking up ice.
Better blow the boots.

24:53.840 --> 24:56.625
No good, we got runback.
- Damn it.

24:56.669 --> 24:58.584
Tristan. Give us a sec?

25:02.022 --> 25:03.806
Fall nights, when the
temperature drops,

25:03.850 --> 25:05.460
it's perfect
for picking up ice.

25:05.504 --> 25:06.766
We need to get out
of these conditions,

25:06.809 --> 25:08.158
which means changing altitude.

25:08.202 --> 25:11.335
We can either climb or descend.
Climbing's safer.

25:11.379 --> 25:13.207
If we descend and the ice
keeps building,

25:13.250 --> 25:14.643
we might not be unable
to regain altitude.

25:14.687 --> 25:16.558
- If the ice doesn't come off,
and we keep losing lift,

25:16.602 --> 25:18.125
it could drive us
into the ground.

25:18.168 --> 25:19.430
- If the cabin pressure drops,

25:19.474 --> 25:20.780
more nitrogen can release
into Mark's tissues,

25:20.823 --> 25:22.608
he could have an embolism
and die.

25:22.651 --> 25:24.479
Climbing is not an option.

25:25.262 --> 25:27.047
- Looks like we're going down.

25:29.049 --> 25:30.572
- Nothing to worry about.

25:30.616 --> 25:32.226
The pilots have everything
under control.

25:35.534 --> 25:38.319
- I can barely maintain 6,000.
Set max continuous power.

25:40.408 --> 25:42.105
- Max continuous power set.

25:43.237 --> 25:44.717
The ice isn't shedding.

25:45.718 --> 25:46.980
Our speed's dropping.
- Might have to firewall

25:47.023 --> 25:48.938
the throttle,
I can't maintain airspeed.

25:48.982 --> 25:50.636
- I'll radio Winnipeg,
let them know we're descending

25:50.679 --> 25:52.812
another 2,000 feet. Maybe
that'll keep us from stalling.

25:52.855 --> 25:54.683
- We can't keep descending.
We need to either land,

25:54.727 --> 25:56.511
or find a way to shed the ice.
Fast.

25:58.165 --> 26:00.036
- Thompson?
- We need something closer.

26:00.080 --> 26:01.385
Bear River.

26:01.429 --> 26:03.213
We'll do a low approach,
try and shed it.

26:03.257 --> 26:04.519
If it works, we carry on
to Winnipeg.

26:04.563 --> 26:06.173
If not, we have to land.
- If we land,

26:06.216 --> 26:07.696
we'll have to de-ice manually.

26:07.740 --> 26:09.393
Bear River's a ghost town,
we might be stuck there

26:09.437 --> 26:11.874
for hours. The patient doesn't
have that long.

26:11.918 --> 26:13.441
- We either take the risk,
or we crash.

26:15.356 --> 26:16.923
[suspenseful music]

26:19.752 --> 26:21.318
- Gear?
- Down, three green.

26:21.362 --> 26:22.711
- Brakes?
- Checked.

26:22.755 --> 26:24.321
- Props?
- Full forward.

26:32.547 --> 26:33.853
- Come on, come on...

26:35.376 --> 26:36.986
[intense music]

26:41.034 --> 26:43.210
Yes! I see it, it's coming off.

26:44.646 --> 26:46.605
- Airspeed's coming up,
we can climb.

26:48.694 --> 26:49.825
[sighs]

26:51.958 --> 26:53.394
Next stop, Winnipeg.

26:54.134 --> 26:55.396
- Nice work, Nowak.

26:55.439 --> 26:58.094
[inspiring music]

27:05.798 --> 27:07.408
- Hey Trainwreck,

27:07.451 --> 27:09.758
still take your coffee
with four sugars, right?

27:09.802 --> 27:11.499
- What God damn time is this?

27:12.152 --> 27:14.284
- Shift worker time.

27:14.328 --> 27:16.156
But I brought you
some real coffee from home.

27:16.547 --> 27:18.593
- Can you get the lights, Flip?

27:19.159 --> 27:20.595
- Weenuk, the lights are on!

27:22.118 --> 27:23.554
- What?
- The lights are on.

27:24.686 --> 27:25.556
- What do you mean?

27:26.688 --> 27:27.863
I can't see.

27:28.777 --> 27:31.911
Oh God, Crystal, I can't see!

27:35.958 --> 27:38.265
- Trevor? Hey, Dr. Trevor!

27:38.308 --> 27:40.223
Tyra Makokis came in with
an injury

27:40.267 --> 27:42.356
from falling off a step.
She said she reached

27:42.399 --> 27:44.271
for the handrail,
but couldn't catch it.

27:44.314 --> 27:46.447
That's not normal
for a 25-year-old.

27:46.490 --> 27:48.623
She's been clumsy lately,
lost her job,

27:48.667 --> 27:50.756
struggling to keep track
of information...

27:50.799 --> 27:52.758
- Weakness, cognitive changes,
vision loss.

27:54.281 --> 27:55.630
- I think Tyra has MS.

27:57.327 --> 27:58.459
- Not a lot of people would go
to MS in an Indigenous patient.

28:00.113 --> 28:01.462
Let's order a lumbar puncture
to look for oligoclonal bands

28:01.505 --> 28:04.160
and see if there's evidence
of lesions on that MRI.

28:04.204 --> 28:05.771
Good instinct, Crystal.

28:05.814 --> 28:07.773
- Good would have been
if I'd clued in yesterday

28:07.816 --> 28:09.949
and ordered an LP when she was
telling me all this stuff.

28:09.992 --> 28:13.126
- Hey. MS can take years
to be properly diagnosed.

28:13.169 --> 28:15.084
If you caught it this early,
Tyra will be able to get

28:15.128 --> 28:16.346
the treatment she needs.

28:16.390 --> 28:18.044
That's a very good thing,
Crystal.

28:21.787 --> 28:25.181
[soft music]

28:27.749 --> 28:29.838
- Come on, baby,
come to papa.

28:30.796 --> 28:34.147
One shot of your fine ass
is going to pay for
this whole trip.

28:34.190 --> 28:35.365
Yes!

28:40.936 --> 28:42.198
[birds chirping]

28:48.683 --> 28:50.337
[tense music]

28:50.380 --> 28:51.991
Oh, my God!

28:56.343 --> 28:58.737
[dramatic music]

28:59.825 --> 29:01.827
- What do you got?
- Sera Makasis, 38.

29:01.870 --> 29:05.134
We haven't moved her, she's been
in and out of consciousness.

29:05.178 --> 29:07.310
She's our Kindergarten teacher,
a good woman.

29:07.354 --> 29:09.095
- Sera, can you hear me?

29:10.531 --> 29:13.012
Unconscious. Head injury,

29:13.055 --> 29:14.753
possible spinal injury
or internal bleeding,

29:14.796 --> 29:16.406
depending what's happening
under this vehicle.

29:16.450 --> 29:18.495
We need to get her
out of here, now!

29:18.539 --> 29:19.801
I need a board and a C-collar,
now!

29:21.237 --> 29:24.414
When I say pull, go. Got it?

29:24.458 --> 29:26.765
Alright, on my count,
lift the ATV.

29:26.808 --> 29:28.549
Three, two, one.

29:28.592 --> 29:29.463
[grunts]

29:29.506 --> 29:31.857
[âª]

29:33.032 --> 29:35.599
Alright, let's strap her
and get out of here.

29:42.041 --> 29:43.999
- Hey! Guess who's got two eyes

29:44.043 --> 29:46.393
and can see you look
like shit?

29:46.436 --> 29:47.873
This girl.
My vision came back!

29:47.916 --> 29:48.961
- That's great, Ty.

29:49.004 --> 29:50.397
- So, when do I go to Winnipeg?

29:50.440 --> 29:52.399
Think they'll throw in free
boobs with the nose job?

29:53.748 --> 29:55.794
- We might have to hold off
on that.

29:56.446 --> 29:57.578
- Why?

30:00.102 --> 30:01.103
What's wrong?

30:02.322 --> 30:04.193
- The doctor will be in soon
to explain.

30:04.237 --> 30:06.717
- Don't hide behind that
bougie bullshit, Flip.

30:06.761 --> 30:08.763
If there's something wrong
with me, you tell me.

30:09.198 --> 30:11.287
[in NÃªhiyawwin]

30:17.293 --> 30:20.470
- We took a look at your
spinal fluid and brain imaging.

30:21.820 --> 30:25.040
Between that and the symptoms
you told me about...

30:26.259 --> 30:29.740
We think you have
Multiple Sclerosis, Tyra.

30:30.698 --> 30:32.874
You'll have to see
a specialist to confirm.

30:35.746 --> 30:37.923
[gentle music]

30:38.967 --> 30:42.579
Hey, hey.
I know that sounds scary.

30:42.623 --> 30:43.972
But we caught it early.

30:44.016 --> 30:45.408
And with the right treatment,

30:45.452 --> 30:46.975
most of your symptoms
can be managed.

30:48.890 --> 30:49.804
[sighs]

30:51.980 --> 30:53.155
- I thought...

30:56.289 --> 30:57.420
...that it was me.

31:00.859 --> 31:03.252
I was Trainwreck Tyra
for so long.

31:03.296 --> 31:05.515
And I worked so hard
to get past that.

31:06.429 --> 31:08.475
[sobbing]
But when all this bad stuff

31:08.518 --> 31:10.651
started happening,
I was terrified I'd gone back

31:10.694 --> 31:12.044
to being her again.

31:13.393 --> 31:14.742
A trainwreck.

31:17.484 --> 31:19.486
- We'll send you home
on a schedevac

31:19.529 --> 31:21.270
until we get you in to see
a neurologist in Winnipeg

31:21.314 --> 31:24.143
about the best treatment plan
for your MS.

31:24.186 --> 31:26.710
We can do the nose
and the brain in one go.

31:28.495 --> 31:30.279
- Is it weird I'm...

31:31.715 --> 31:35.632
relieved and scared?

31:37.199 --> 31:38.809
- Be weirder if
you weren't, chisk.

31:39.332 --> 31:40.811
I'll pick you up myself to go
to Winnipeg.

31:40.855 --> 31:43.510
Maybe we can both get new boobs.
[chuckling]

[soft music]

31:58.917 --> 32:00.266
[speaking NÃªhiyawwin]

32:08.143 --> 32:10.972
- I'm sorry, I don't understand.

32:11.016 --> 32:12.756
Do you speak any English?

32:14.280 --> 32:15.846
Let's see here...

32:17.196 --> 32:18.632
Hey, hey.

32:19.807 --> 32:20.982
Can you point to it?

32:21.026 --> 32:23.028
[speaking NÃªhiyawwin]

32:24.290 --> 32:25.987
Hey.

32:26.031 --> 32:27.641
[tense music]

32:38.043 --> 32:39.783
- So that Jeremy guy Tyra
mentioned,

32:39.827 --> 32:42.221
he's not taking you out
to dinner tonight, is he?

32:42.264 --> 32:44.527
- Shuy. Jeremy's more like
the problem you pay

32:44.571 --> 32:45.876
someone else to take out.

32:45.920 --> 32:47.269
He's ancient history.

32:48.662 --> 32:50.142
- So I can take you
to dinner then.

32:51.578 --> 32:53.188
- You know what?
I have a better idea.

32:53.754 --> 32:55.277
I'll take you to dinner.

32:55.625 --> 32:57.279
But I expect you to put out.

32:59.325 --> 33:00.543
With a good reference letter.

33:00.587 --> 33:02.806
- You're applying
to med school?

33:02.850 --> 33:04.199
What made you change your mind?

33:04.765 --> 33:06.985
- I didn't want to leave
my community again.

33:07.637 --> 33:08.725
But I realized...

33:09.726 --> 33:10.858
I can do this for them.

33:11.337 --> 33:13.165
[indistinct chatter on PA]

33:23.044 --> 33:25.133
- Hello?
-Hey, Dad.

33:25.177 --> 33:27.179
- Hayley, I've been trying
to get in touch with you.

33:27.222 --> 33:29.137
The oncologist's office
in Winnipeg called.

33:29.181 --> 33:30.660
They said you missed
your appointment?

33:30.704 --> 33:32.793
- Um... Yeah.

33:32.836 --> 33:34.273
Do you remember
Mom's apple pie?

33:35.230 --> 33:38.146
What do you think she put
in it, was it nutmeg?

33:38.190 --> 33:40.322
- You can't keep putting
this off, Hayley.

33:40.366 --> 33:41.932
You have the BRCA1 gene.

33:43.891 --> 33:46.720
- Why can't we ever just talk
about her, Dad?

33:46.763 --> 33:49.244
Why does it always have to be
about the cancer?

33:49.288 --> 33:51.246
- If your mom had known,

33:51.290 --> 33:54.728
if she'd had access to the kind
of early intervention you do,

33:54.771 --> 33:56.338
it would've made all
the difference.

33:56.860 --> 33:58.732
[beeping]

33:58.775 --> 34:00.081
[sighs]

34:00.125 --> 34:02.823
- Gotta go, Dad.
Call just came in.

34:03.954 --> 34:05.173
[sighs]

34:06.653 --> 34:08.959
- Smell ya later, Flipper.
- Tell your mom I said hi.

34:09.003 --> 34:11.136
- I will!
- Crystal, 27-year-old woman,

34:11.179 --> 34:13.442
rolled an ATV down into
a riverbank and was pinned.

34:13.486 --> 34:15.488
Head injury,
possible internal bleeding.

34:15.531 --> 34:17.098
She keeps trying to tell me
something,

34:17.142 --> 34:18.708
but it's not
the language guide.

34:18.752 --> 34:20.058
Whatever it is, it's important.

34:20.971 --> 34:23.757
[speaking NÃªhiyawwin]

34:23.800 --> 34:25.498
- She's asking for her son.

34:25.541 --> 34:27.282
- She wants someone to bring
him from home?

34:27.326 --> 34:29.893
- No, she says he was
on the ATV with her.

34:30.590 --> 34:31.939
You didn't know?

34:31.982 --> 34:33.984
- There was no else in the area,
we just assumed...

34:34.507 --> 34:36.987
Oh god.
There's a kid out there alone?

34:37.031 --> 34:39.033
[intense music]

34:40.034 --> 34:41.427
- This is Tyra, 25,

34:41.470 --> 34:43.994
recently diagnosed
with multiple sclerosis.

34:44.038 --> 34:46.475
She has a broken nose,
waiting for swelling to reduce

34:46.519 --> 34:49.043
before taking her to Winnipeg
for a nasal fracture reduction

34:49.087 --> 34:51.132
and appointment
with a neurologist.

34:51.176 --> 34:52.873
- Oof. You've had a busy
couple days, huh Tyra?

34:52.916 --> 34:54.092
- Yeah. It was a real rager.

34:54.135 --> 34:55.963
- I heard you were busy too.

34:56.006 --> 34:58.400
One of the other nurses said
you ran into a wolf last night?

34:58.444 --> 35:00.533
- Oh yeah.
It was crazy, this wolf

35:00.576 --> 35:01.708
just would not go away.

35:01.751 --> 35:03.144
- Wait. That was you?

35:05.842 --> 35:07.322
- Orion24?

35:07.366 --> 35:09.019
[soft music]

35:14.373 --> 35:16.201
[beeping]

35:17.898 --> 35:20.292
- It's an FOA. There's a missing
child at Black Tree.

35:20.335 --> 35:21.858
- We've got to go.

35:21.902 --> 35:23.425
- Yeah.

35:33.392 --> 35:36.873
- We're looking for a seven-
year-old boy, Ian Makasis.

35:36.917 --> 35:39.311
He's been missing
for at least four hours.

35:39.354 --> 35:41.182
We've mapped out a grid search

35:41.226 --> 35:43.184
over an area
of five square kilometers.

35:44.403 --> 35:45.491
- What happened?

35:45.882 --> 35:47.536
- There was an accident.

35:47.580 --> 35:48.885
We medevac'd the mom, but...

35:49.669 --> 35:50.887
We didn't know.

35:50.931 --> 35:52.672
There was no sign of a kid.

35:52.715 --> 35:55.196
- Fan out in pairs,
but stay within sight

35:55.240 --> 35:56.763
of the next closest pair.

35:56.806 --> 35:59.374
We don't need anybody else
getting lost.

36:05.598 --> 36:06.686
- Chopper?

36:08.775 --> 36:10.124
- Yeah, let's go.

36:12.082 --> 36:15.260
[âª]

36:18.480 --> 36:19.655
- It's been hours.

36:20.352 --> 36:21.701
It'll be dark soon...

36:23.529 --> 36:26.619
- That's one hell of a current.
Rain would've made it worse.

36:28.490 --> 36:31.232
- Medic! Someone fainted!
Over here!

36:31.276 --> 36:32.668
- I'll check to make sure
he's okay.

36:49.946 --> 36:51.513
[soft music]

37:17.974 --> 37:20.063
- Ian? Ian!

37:21.326 --> 37:23.066
[speaking NÃªhiyawwin]

37:25.504 --> 37:27.375
- Uh, do you speak English?

37:28.333 --> 37:29.812
- My mom's hurt.

37:29.856 --> 37:31.292
- I know.
We took her to the hospital.

37:31.336 --> 37:32.728
We didn't know you were
lost out here.

37:32.772 --> 37:34.469
Are you hurt?
- I wasn't lost.

37:34.513 --> 37:36.993
I was following the river,
like my mom said.

37:38.343 --> 37:39.605
Is she okay?

37:40.910 --> 37:42.303
- Why don't I take you to her?

37:44.610 --> 37:46.525
[soft music]

37:53.401 --> 37:54.315
- Mama!

37:54.359 --> 37:56.274
[speaking NÃªhiyawwin]

38:12.768 --> 38:15.945
- You look pretty glum for
someone eating an entire pie.

38:15.989 --> 38:18.992
- I've been trying to make
this pie my whole life.

38:19.035 --> 38:21.995
But it's never going to taste
like how my mom made it.

38:25.390 --> 38:27.043
I'm just missing her today.

38:30.395 --> 38:33.441
- Calls with kids are hard.

38:34.007 --> 38:35.922
[birds chirping]

38:36.879 --> 38:38.185
- You pick up some homework?

38:38.228 --> 38:40.622
- Uh, Crystal hooked me up.

38:40.666 --> 38:42.842
Trying to learn
some of the language so...

38:42.885 --> 38:44.365
no one else gets lost.

38:49.239 --> 38:52.330
[gentle music]

38:57.422 --> 39:00.120
[panting]

39:00.163 --> 39:02.775
[insects chirping]

39:18.051 --> 39:20.619
[âª]

39:35.285 --> 39:36.286
- Hey, Trevor.

39:36.896 --> 39:38.724
Kind of formal
for a house call.

39:38.767 --> 39:40.029
You going to court?

39:40.813 --> 39:42.292
- Here for our date.

39:42.336 --> 39:43.511
- I thought I was
taking you out.

39:43.555 --> 39:45.426
- You can. Next time.

39:45.470 --> 39:46.949
But if this is gonna be
our first date,

39:46.993 --> 39:49.169
you gotta let a guy bring
his A game.

39:49.212 --> 39:50.997
- What about my A game plans?

39:51.040 --> 39:52.433
How am I gonna top...

39:53.042 --> 39:54.435
I'm guessing funeral.

39:54.479 --> 39:56.089
- The nearest concert hall

39:56.132 --> 39:57.264
is some 8-hour drive
away, so...

39:57.307 --> 39:59.005
What's your Wi-Fi like?

39:59.658 --> 40:02.965
[gentle music playing]

40:14.237 --> 40:15.804
Is that... a tear?

40:17.589 --> 40:19.460
Crystal Highway are you crying?

40:19.504 --> 40:21.244
[laughs]
- I was.

40:21.288 --> 40:23.246
My people aren't ashamed to cry.

40:25.684 --> 40:27.642
It's healthy, and beautiful.

40:27.686 --> 40:29.818
- Oh, for sure.
I cry all the time.

40:29.862 --> 40:32.081
I had actually had a little cry
on the way over.

40:32.125 --> 40:34.432
Thinking about your poor
grade 10 teacher.

40:34.475 --> 40:35.694
[chuckling]

40:40.176 --> 40:41.787
You know, I was going to pull
the old

40:41.830 --> 40:44.050
"Are you cold? Here's my jacket"
move, but uh...

40:44.093 --> 40:45.617
this is way better.

40:46.531 --> 40:48.271
- Is the jacket still
an option?

40:48.315 --> 40:49.534
[chuckling]

40:54.277 --> 40:56.802
- You know, I was worried
you might think the symphony

40:56.845 --> 40:58.760
was kind of pretentious.

40:58.804 --> 41:02.634
But my grandpa used to take me
to matinees when I was a kid.

41:04.679 --> 41:05.898
- It's beautiful.

41:08.378 --> 41:09.423
- I'm glad you like it.

41:09.989 --> 41:11.773
- Company's okay too.

41:14.994 --> 41:18.737
[âª]

41:23.872 --> 41:26.353
- You've been blowing up
my phone all night.

41:26.396 --> 41:29.182
I'm here, what do you want?
- Come inside.

41:29.225 --> 41:31.097
Please, it'll only take
a few minutes.

41:42.064 --> 41:44.066
This place just came up
for rent.

41:44.110 --> 41:45.633
You have to look past the paint,

41:45.677 --> 41:47.548
I know you don't like
grey walls. But...

41:48.114 --> 41:50.072
There's a good size kitchen.

41:50.943 --> 41:53.075
I mean, imagine the meals
we could make in here.

41:53.902 --> 41:56.122
If you don't like anything,
we can change it.

41:58.037 --> 42:00.082
The bathroom floor
has linoleum,

42:00.126 --> 42:02.302
but a nice big tub,
like you like.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.785
The main bedroom's
right next door,

42:07.742 --> 42:09.439
and here...

42:14.488 --> 42:16.055
You were right.

42:16.098 --> 42:18.144
I broke up with you because
I was scared.

42:19.537 --> 42:21.364
- And you aren't, now?

42:23.671 --> 42:25.020
- I'm terrified.

42:25.891 --> 42:28.371
The only thing I've ever
known about my birth parents

42:29.329 --> 42:31.070
is that they never wanted me.

42:31.549 --> 42:33.246
And I never want my kid
to feel that.

42:33.768 --> 42:35.117
Not know who they are.

42:37.903 --> 42:38.817
You were right, Mads.

42:39.774 --> 42:40.993
We can do this.

42:41.907 --> 42:43.604
So please...

42:45.824 --> 42:47.086
...forgive me?

42:51.830 --> 42:54.136
- You're lucky we can change
the paint.

42:55.747 --> 42:57.531
[soft music]

43:04.582 --> 43:06.845
We're going to be
a family, Bodie.

43:16.332 --> 43:19.205
Subtitling: difuze
