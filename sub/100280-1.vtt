WEBVTT

01:25.530 --> 01:27.599
All right,
let's chop and load.

02:11.210 --> 02:13.044
Good evening, Officer.

02:13.111 --> 02:15.747
Y'all need my license
or anything, huh?

02:15.813 --> 02:19.050
No, that's not necessary.

02:19.117 --> 02:21.452
That's a sharp-looking truck
you got.

02:21.519 --> 02:22.987
Yes, sir. Thank you.

02:23.054 --> 02:26.157
Those rims look like
they cost you a pretty penny.

02:27.592 --> 02:29.295
Who you been working for?

02:29.361 --> 02:31.462
Oh, no, sir.
I don't work for nobody.

02:31.529 --> 02:32.997
Got my own pulping business.

02:33.064 --> 02:35.566
You know, I clear out
all these trees around here.

02:35.633 --> 02:39.271
So, you ain't got no boss
to check in with, huh?

02:39.338 --> 02:41.005
That must be pretty nice.

02:41.072 --> 02:42.640
Free to run
up and down the road,

02:42.707 --> 02:44.343
wherever you want to,
whenever you want to,

02:44.410 --> 02:46.978
in this fancy truck.

02:47.045 --> 02:50.416
Hey, well, not if my wife
got something to say about it.

02:52.951 --> 02:54.719
Yeah.

02:54.786 --> 02:57.522
I heard that ain't stopped you
before, though.

02:58.790 --> 03:00.925
Ain't that right, Johnny D.?

03:10.768 --> 03:13.972
You want to make
a break for it? Hmm?

03:14.038 --> 03:15.506
No, sir, I don't wanna
do nothing...

03:15.573 --> 03:17.608
'Cause after what you done,

03:17.675 --> 03:20.279
I'm looking for any excuse
to get this over with

03:20.346 --> 03:22.480
right here, right now.

03:22.547 --> 03:23.915
Sir, I ain't did nothing,

03:23.982 --> 03:25.717
and I think y'all got
the wrong person here.

03:25.783 --> 03:27.252
Y'all got me confused

03:27.319 --> 03:28.486
with somebody. And I think...

03:28.553 --> 03:29.754
I ain't got you confused
with nobody.

03:29.821 --> 03:33.825
I don't have a thing
to do with this.

03:33.891 --> 03:35.294
Sir, you got me
confused with somebody.

03:35.361 --> 03:36.561
I ain't did nothing wrong.

03:38.529 --> 03:39.630
<i>We all know Monroeville</i>

03:39.697 --> 03:41.065
<i>as the peaceful town</i>

03:41.132 --> 03:43.235
<i>where Harper Lee wrote</i>
To Kill a Mockingbird.

03:43.302 --> 03:46.938
<i>Last year, that peace was
shattered by a brutal crime.</i>

03:47.005 --> 03:50.108
<i>On the 1st of November,
18-year-old Ronda Morrison</i>

03:50.174 --> 03:52.478
<i>was found dead
at Jackson Cleaners.</i>

03:52.543 --> 03:56.315
<i>Morrison had been strangled
and shot by Walter McMillian,</i>

03:56.382 --> 03:58.716
<i>known locally as Johnny D.</i>

03:58.783 --> 04:00.918
<i>McMillian was convicted
by a jury</i>

04:00.985 --> 04:02.954
<i>who recommended
a life sentence.</i>

04:03.021 --> 04:04.256
<i>But today,</i>

04:04.323 --> 04:07.625
<i>Judge Robert E. Lee Key
overrode their decision</i>

04:07.692 --> 04:10.396
<i>and sentenced McMillian
to death.</i>

04:10.462 --> 04:11.763
<i>We promised the community</i>

04:11.829 --> 04:13.365
<i>that we would find him,

04:13.432 --> 04:16.435
<i>You commit a crime
like this in my town,</i>

04:16.502 --> 04:19.003
<i>one way or another,
you're gonna pay for it.</i>

04:19.070 --> 04:20.938
<i>As McMillian
awaits execution</i>

04:21.005 --> 04:23.208
<i>at Holman
Correctional Facility,</i>

04:23.275 --> 04:26.144

<i>in knowing that, today,</i>

04:27.612 --> 04:30.548
<i>justice has finally
been served.</i>

04:48.866 --> 04:50.269
Thank you.

05:20.265 --> 05:21.966
You got one hour.

05:28.639 --> 05:29.740
Uh...

05:29.807 --> 05:33.611
Hi, Mr. Davis. I'm Bryan.

05:33.678 --> 05:35.447
Henry.

05:35.514 --> 05:37.115
Um...

05:37.182 --> 05:38.916
The Southern Prisoners
Defense Committee,

05:38.983 --> 05:41.320
they sent me here
to tell you that,

05:41.386 --> 05:43.355
that they don't have
a lawyer for you yet,

05:43.422 --> 05:45.224
but they hope to soon.

05:45.290 --> 05:46.858
You're not a lawyer?

05:46.924 --> 05:49.794
No. I'm still in school.

05:49.861 --> 05:52.830
Just interning here
for the summer.

05:52.897 --> 05:56.734
So, you can't tell me nothing
about my case?

05:56.801 --> 05:59.937
I mean,
I was supposed to tell you

06:00.004 --> 06:01.639
that you're not
at risk of execution

06:01.706 --> 06:03.708
any time
within the next year.

06:08.012 --> 06:11.216
Can you say that again?

06:11.283 --> 06:14.286
That you're not at risk
of execution any time

06:14.353 --> 06:15.387
within the next year?

06:20.459 --> 06:23.861
That's the best news
I've heard in a long time.

06:35.207 --> 06:38.343
I didn't want
my wife or kids

06:38.410 --> 06:41.746
showing up if I had
an execution date coming.

06:43.549 --> 06:45.750
Now they can come visit.

06:47.553 --> 06:48.953
Thank you.

06:49.787 --> 06:51.223
Thank you.

06:55.394 --> 06:56.628
Serious.

06:56.694 --> 06:58.430
My mom made me
join our church choir

06:58.497 --> 06:59.797
when I was, like, four.

06:59.864 --> 07:02.133
I sang lead baritone
all through high school.

07:02.201 --> 07:04.101
I played piano
at my church growing up.

07:04.168 --> 07:05.237
AME?

07:05.304 --> 07:06.338
God is good...

07:06.405 --> 07:07.506
...all the time.

07:07.573 --> 07:09.441
All the time.

07:09.508 --> 07:13.345
A couple AME Choir boys
hanging on death row.

07:13.412 --> 07:14.745
My mom would go trip.

07:14.812 --> 07:16.113
Man, that's crazy.

07:16.181 --> 07:17.915
What school are you going to?

07:17.982 --> 07:19.951
I'm at Harvard.

07:20.017 --> 07:22.688
Seriously?
You're going to Harvard?

07:22.753 --> 07:24.323
That's white-boy status, bro.

07:24.389 --> 07:26.592
What the hell are you doing
slumming it up in here for?

07:28.227 --> 07:30.094
I'm in law school because
I just wanted to help people.

07:30.161 --> 07:32.863
Just haven't figured out
the best way to do that yet.

07:32.930 --> 07:34.266
Honestly, this internship

07:34.333 --> 07:37.068
has been the best
experience so far.

07:37.134 --> 07:39.870
Working on death row
has been your best experience?

07:39.937 --> 07:42.106
You need
to get out more, bro.

07:44.775 --> 07:46.511
Should've been done
two hours ago.

07:46.578 --> 07:49.113
- I'm sorry, I didn't realize.
- Supposed to watch the clock.

07:49.181 --> 07:51.816
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey. Sir!

07:51.882 --> 07:53.552
Calm down,
he didn't do anything!

07:53.619 --> 07:54.720
You need to shut your mouth.

07:54.785 --> 07:56.421
It's okay, Bryan.

07:56.488 --> 07:58.657
Don't worry about me.
You just come back.

Mom still mad at you?

08:44.869 --> 08:45.970
For what?

08:46.037 --> 08:47.339
I don't know.

08:47.406 --> 08:48.740
Maybe for rejecting
all those job offers

08:48.806 --> 08:50.642
so you can be poor
in Alabama.

08:50.709 --> 08:52.043
And Howie telling her

08:52.109 --> 08:53.010
about that lynching in Mobile
didn't help.

08:53.077 --> 08:54.212
What?

08:54.279 --> 08:55.213
I said it happened
seven years ago.

08:55.280 --> 08:56.748
Yeah, that made it better.

08:56.814 --> 08:59.016
You two were supposed
to be on my side.

08:59.083 --> 09:00.385
Pop, how are we
looking up there?

09:00.452 --> 09:02.187
Just added
three quarts of oil.

09:02.254 --> 09:03.888
But you should check it again
when you get there.

09:03.954 --> 09:05.490
All right, thanks.

09:05.557 --> 09:07.825
Talk to your mom yet?

09:13.864 --> 09:15.467
What did those leaves
do to you?

09:19.003 --> 09:21.306
You're not gonna say bye
to your son?

09:22.374 --> 09:23.974
I know you got
your law degree now,

09:24.041 --> 09:25.544
and you think you're grown,

09:25.610 --> 09:27.312
but you're still my child.

09:27.379 --> 09:28.846
And I'm the one
who has to deal

09:28.913 --> 09:30.147
with your funeral arrangements

09:30.215 --> 09:31.583
if you get killed down there.

09:31.650 --> 09:32.850
Come on, Ma.

09:32.917 --> 09:34.985
Oh, you think this is funny?

09:35.052 --> 09:36.153
'Cause if you can't see

09:36.221 --> 09:37.589
the danger
in what you're doing,

09:37.656 --> 09:39.924
you need to ask Harvard
for your money back.

09:39.990 --> 09:42.194
You used to be smarter
than that.

09:58.042 --> 10:00.178
The first time
I visited death row,

10:00.245 --> 10:03.448
I wasn't expecting to meet
somebody the same age as me.

10:04.716 --> 10:06.385
Grew up on the same music.

10:06.451 --> 10:08.587
From a neighborhood
just like ours.

10:12.691 --> 10:14.359
Could've been me, Mama.

10:16.795 --> 10:21.098
I don't wanna move far away
from you. I love you.

10:21.165 --> 10:22.768
But you always taught me
to fight for the people

10:22.834 --> 10:24.669
who need the help the most.

10:28.774 --> 10:31.108
I am very proud of you, son.

10:33.110 --> 10:36.581
I know your heart's
in the right place.

10:36.648 --> 10:39.184
But it's not that simple.

10:39.251 --> 10:42.621
What you're doing is gonna
make a lot of people upset.

10:44.922 --> 10:46.924
You better be careful.

10:48.727 --> 10:50.161
I will.

10:52.864 --> 10:54.266
I promise.

10:58.303 --> 11:00.672
There she goes.

11:50.288 --> 11:51.756
You gotta be kidding me.

11:51.823 --> 11:54.793
We had an agreement to rent
this space for two years.

11:54.860 --> 11:56.328
You said it was a done deal.

11:56.394 --> 11:57.896
That's before I knew
what you were doing here.

11:57.963 --> 11:59.264
We are giving
poor people

11:59.331 --> 12:01.299
their constitutional right
to counsel, Bill.

12:01.366 --> 12:02.601
Do you mind explaining
to my son

12:02.667 --> 12:04.168
what you think
is so wrong with that?

12:04.236 --> 12:05.337
Eva, what's up?

12:05.403 --> 12:06.872
Oh, Bryan. Thank God.

12:06.938 --> 12:10.308
This is the executive director
of our organization.

12:10.375 --> 12:11.776
He just got here
and was expecting

12:11.843 --> 12:14.144
to move into the office
that you promised us.

12:14.212 --> 12:16.248
You said
you were the director.

12:16.314 --> 12:18.082
Director of Operations.

12:18.148 --> 12:19.284
And you're making me
look very bad

12:19.351 --> 12:20.752
in front of my boss
right now.

12:20.819 --> 12:22.287
She said you were a lawyer,

12:22.354 --> 12:24.823
but nobody told me it was
for murderers on death row.

12:24.890 --> 12:27.559
We're providing legal services
to people who need help.

12:27.626 --> 12:29.594
And they'll have to do it
someplace else.

12:29.661 --> 12:32.297
'Cause I can't have
people like that around here.

12:32.364 --> 12:35.065
Not everyone is in there
for a good reason, sir.

12:36.468 --> 12:38.770
Y'all have a good day now.

12:40.104 --> 12:42.240
What a piece of shit.

12:42.307 --> 12:43.608
I'm so sorry.

12:43.675 --> 12:45.744
This is not how I wanted
to welcome you here.

12:45.810 --> 12:48.045
I will find us an office,
I promise you I will.

12:48.112 --> 12:49.414
I just gotta
change my tactics.

12:49.481 --> 12:51.283
It'll be fine.
We can work from anywhere.

12:51.349 --> 12:52.551
Yeah,
we'll just have Kris

12:52.617 --> 12:53.985
clean up his toys
in the living room.

12:54.051 --> 12:55.287
- Right, Kris?
- Oh, yeah?

12:55.353 --> 12:57.422
I'll think about it.

12:57.489 --> 12:59.123
I'm sorry for cussing, baby.

12:59.190 --> 13:00.592
It's okay.

13:00.659 --> 13:02.694
He was a piece of shit,
though.

13:03.962 --> 13:05.363
I was a psychology major

13:05.430 --> 13:06.998
writing a paper
on capital punishment

13:07.064 --> 13:10.635
when I met my first death row
inmate, Wayne Ritter.

13:10.702 --> 13:13.638
He and his friend robbed
a pawn shop in Mobile.

13:13.705 --> 13:17.475
His friend shot the owner
and they both got death.

13:17.542 --> 13:20.077
Is he the reason
why you got into this?

13:20.144 --> 13:24.081
His attorney was openly
in favor of the death penalty.

13:24.148 --> 13:27.285
He thought
mad dogs ought to die.

13:27.352 --> 13:28.620
A lot of the folks
on death row

13:28.687 --> 13:30.188
either had
shitty representation,

13:30.255 --> 13:31.556
or none at all.

13:31.623 --> 13:33.191
So, I just started
calling every law firm

13:33.258 --> 13:34.626
in the Yellow Pages,

13:34.693 --> 13:36.328
just trying to find anybody
that could help.

13:36.394 --> 13:40.298
I was averaging
20 rejections a day.

13:40.365 --> 13:42.067
She was pretty stressed out.

13:42.132 --> 13:43.802
I was just about to give up

13:43.868 --> 13:47.606
when I got a call from
a Harvard lawyer saying that

13:47.672 --> 13:49.407
he had just passed
the Alabama Bar

13:49.474 --> 13:52.142
and had federal funding
to start a legal center

13:52.210 --> 13:54.679
for inmates on death row.

13:54.746 --> 13:57.882
I was in before
you even offered me the job.

13:57.949 --> 14:00.518
And before you knew
I couldn't pay you anything.

14:00.585 --> 14:01.820
What's that?

14:01.886 --> 14:04.022
Oh, yeah, Doug doesn't know
about that part yet.

14:04.089 --> 14:05.557
- Sorry, honey.
- All right.

14:05.624 --> 14:08.293
How's it going, son?
You seem tired.

14:08.360 --> 14:10.562
Okay.
Let's go brush your teeth.

14:10.629 --> 14:11.663
Excuse us.

14:13.398 --> 14:15.533
I'll make up the couch
for you, Bryan.

14:16.568 --> 14:18.670
I'm excited about
what you're doing.

14:20.905 --> 14:22.374
Me, too.

15:37.183 --> 15:38.817
I should be in the log.

15:38.883 --> 15:41.319
I'm scheduled
to see six clients today.

15:43.421 --> 15:46.324
Well, I ain't seen you before.

15:46.391 --> 15:48.526
That's because
I just moved here.

15:50.995 --> 15:52.664
You really a lawyer?

15:54.332 --> 15:57.635
Yes. I am.

15:57.702 --> 15:59.237
Well, I'm gonna have
to search you.

15:59.304 --> 16:02.208
Just go on in that room there
and take everything off.

16:02.273 --> 16:05.610
Attorneys aren't strip
searched for legal visits.

16:05.677 --> 16:07.512
Well, you ain't gonna
visit shit

16:07.579 --> 16:09.981
unless you get in that room
and strip.

16:11.149 --> 16:12.517
Let's go.

16:32.204 --> 16:33.838
Pants and underwear.

17:00.431 --> 17:02.634
Bend over and spread.

17:10.842 --> 17:11.976
You're clear.

17:44.709 --> 17:46.644
<i>I fought in Nam.</i>

17:47.579 --> 17:49.814
First Cavalry Division.

17:51.283 --> 17:55.620
Saw a lot of friends die.

17:57.655 --> 18:02.093
Doctor said I got PTSD.

18:04.495 --> 18:08.833
I did what they said I did.

18:10.602 --> 18:14.072
I put the bomb
on her porch.

18:16.140 --> 18:19.477
I know it don't make sense,

18:20.645 --> 18:24.515
but I didn't mean
to kill nobody.

18:27.919 --> 18:34.360
I think they're gonna
set my execution soon.

18:34.425 --> 18:35.960
Last lawyer said

18:36.027 --> 18:38.663
there ain't nothing
left to do.

18:40.798 --> 18:43.902
There's always something
that we can do.

18:43.968 --> 18:48.106
Whatever you did,
your life is still meaningful.

18:48.172 --> 18:49.841
And I'm gonna do
everything possible

18:49.908 --> 18:51.943
to keep them from taking it.

19:00.451 --> 19:05.023
Now, tell me everything
that happened.

19:05.089 --> 19:07.492
I was given
a court-appointed lawyer,

19:07.558 --> 19:09.961
and he was pretty pitiful.

19:10.028 --> 19:13.665
Never really talked to me
about setting up a defense.

19:13.731 --> 19:16.167
I probably met
the dude three times.

19:17.535 --> 19:19.204
Literally.

19:19.271 --> 19:21.307
<i>He told me that it
would be in my best interest</i>

19:21.373 --> 19:23.841
<i>to plead no contest
to all of those charges.</i>

19:23.908 --> 19:25.476
I'm gonna plead not guilty.

19:25.543 --> 19:26.811
I said I didn't do it.

19:26.878 --> 19:28.247
I didn't have nothing
to do with that.

19:28.314 --> 19:30.349
"You're 20 right now,
if you take this plea

19:30.416 --> 19:31.816
and you do the whole time,

19:31.883 --> 19:34.286
you'll only be 45
when you get out."

19:34.353 --> 19:37.256
<i>In the middle
of my trial, which only lasted</i>

19:37.323 --> 19:40.858
45 minutes to a hour,
which is unheard of.

19:40.925 --> 19:42.894
He wouldn't let me
take the stand.

19:42.961 --> 19:45.331
So, they ended up
finding me guilty.

19:45.397 --> 19:46.998
The judge laughed at me
and said

19:47.065 --> 19:50.202
rehabilitation was
a 70-year-old joke.

19:50.269 --> 19:51.636
<i>My lawyer,</i>

19:51.703 --> 19:52.971
<i>he was there,
but he wasn't there.</i>

19:54.772 --> 19:57.242
It was like I was by myself.

20:13.359 --> 20:17.628
Last lawyer I had,
sitting where you sit, said,

20:17.695 --> 20:19.063
"Johnny D.,
don't worry about nothing,

20:19.130 --> 20:21.065
everything gonna be
all right."

20:23.835 --> 20:26.504
Then they put
that death sentence on me.

20:28.273 --> 20:30.275
Family run out of money.

20:30.342 --> 20:32.277
Money run out, he run out.

20:35.780 --> 20:37.849
What you gonna do different?

20:40.651 --> 20:41.719
Well, the first thing
we could do

20:41.786 --> 20:43.021
is apply for a retrial.

20:43.087 --> 20:45.823
I already did that.
They denied it.

20:45.890 --> 20:48.593
It's right there
in your files.

20:51.230 --> 20:55.033
Okay, then we can ask
for a reconsideration on that.

20:55.099 --> 20:57.202
Then a direct appeal to
the Court of Criminal Appeals

20:57.269 --> 20:59.704
and work our way up to
the State Supreme Court.

20:59.771 --> 21:02.307
If we get denied there,
we could file a Rule 32.

21:02.374 --> 21:04.108
Then a federal
habeas petition.

21:04.176 --> 21:05.411
And if all that fails,
Mr. McMillian,

21:05.477 --> 21:06.677
we could take your case

21:06.744 --> 21:08.146
all the way
to the Supreme Court.

21:08.213 --> 21:10.748
You don't know what you into
down here, do you?

21:10.815 --> 21:12.251
You think all of them
fancy words

21:12.317 --> 21:15.521
gonna get you somewhere
around here in Alabama?

21:15.586 --> 21:18.089
All they gonna do is eat
you alive and spit you out,

21:18.156 --> 21:19.657
just like every other
black man they do,

21:19.724 --> 21:21.260
when they step out of line.

21:21.326 --> 21:24.430
You coming around here
with them fancy suits,

21:24.496 --> 21:25.763
talking all white,

21:25.830 --> 21:27.065
these people don't give
a damn about that.

21:27.131 --> 21:28.633
The only suit
they wanna see a nigga in

21:28.699 --> 21:30.302
is the suit I got on.

21:32.703 --> 21:34.373
Mr. McMillian, I can see
how that could be hard...

21:34.440 --> 21:36.040
No, you don't!

21:37.909 --> 21:41.346
No, you don't.
No, you don't. No, you don't.

21:43.915 --> 21:45.149
You a rich boy from Harvard,

21:45.217 --> 21:47.219
you don't know
what it is down here.

21:47.286 --> 21:50.688
When you're guilty
from the moment you born.

21:52.957 --> 21:54.592
And you can buddy up
with these white folks

21:54.659 --> 21:56.027
and make them laugh,

21:56.094 --> 21:57.695
and try to make them like you,
whatever that is,

21:57.762 --> 21:58.896
and you say,
"Yes, sir. No, ma'am."

21:58.963 --> 22:00.164
But when it's your turn,

22:00.232 --> 22:02.100
they ain't got to have
no fingerprints.

22:02.834 --> 22:05.036
No evidence.

22:05.103 --> 22:09.640
And the only witness they got
made the whole thing up.

22:12.810 --> 22:15.214
Ain't none of that matter,
when all y'all think is,

22:15.280 --> 22:17.382
is I look like a man

22:18.250 --> 22:20.219
who could kill somebody.

22:22.954 --> 22:25.190
But that's not what I think.

22:30.695 --> 22:32.364
You know how many people
have been freed

22:32.431 --> 22:34.266
from Alabama death row?

22:38.069 --> 22:39.338
None.

22:44.809 --> 22:47.945
What make you think
you gonna change that?

22:52.150 --> 22:54.520
I ain't doing this shit again.

22:54.586 --> 22:56.288
- Guard.
- Mr. McMillian...

22:56.355 --> 22:57.788
We done here.

22:57.855 --> 23:00.292
Mr. McMillian, please.

23:01.426 --> 23:03.228
I'm here to help.

23:07.865 --> 23:09.301
What's up, Johnny D.?

23:09.368 --> 23:10.636
Say hello!

23:10.701 --> 23:12.304
How's it going,
my brother?

23:12.371 --> 23:13.605
How'd it go?

23:15.207 --> 23:17.842
How you treating
them needs, motherfucker?

23:39.565 --> 23:41.132
Johnny D.?

23:42.668 --> 23:44.536
Johnny D., you there?

23:44.603 --> 23:45.937
'Sup, Herb?

23:46.871 --> 23:48.273
Ray there?

23:50.642 --> 23:52.944
Ray.

23:53.010 --> 23:55.414
Unavailable at the moment.

23:56.615 --> 23:58.183
Where you at?

23:58.250 --> 24:02.119
Buckingham Palace.
I'm having tea with the Queen.

24:02.187 --> 24:03.355
Oh.

24:03.422 --> 24:04.755
She's a very nice lady.

24:04.822 --> 24:06.658
I'll let you know
when we done.

24:08.260 --> 24:12.397
Hey, Johnny D.,
what you think of the lawyer?

24:12.464 --> 24:14.566
I think he a kid.

24:14.633 --> 24:16.834
Don't know
what he's talking about.

24:16.901 --> 24:18.102
Making all these promises

24:18.169 --> 24:20.205
he ain't gonna
be able to keep.

24:21.540 --> 24:24.276
I thought he was nice.

24:24.343 --> 24:25.377
Nice?

24:25.444 --> 24:28.580
The hell you want
a nice lawyer for?

24:28.647 --> 24:30.716
Nice ain't gonna get you shit.

24:30.781 --> 24:32.116
Look at Johnny D.

24:32.184 --> 24:34.952
Nice as a puppy,
yet he in here with us.

24:35.019 --> 24:36.255
Well, I didn't know

24:36.321 --> 24:37.788
you thought about me
like that, Ray.

24:37.855 --> 24:39.857
I mean,
just you nice and everything,

24:39.924 --> 24:42.026
you not as nice
as La Toya Jackson,

24:42.093 --> 24:45.129
but for an old man
on the row, you a'ight.

24:45.197 --> 24:47.932
Hey, I thought you said
I was the old man.

24:47.999 --> 24:50.968
Well, Johnny D. is old, Herb,
you more ancient.

24:51.035 --> 24:52.937
Sorry to tell you.

24:59.977 --> 25:01.812
Herb, turn that music up.

25:02.414 --> 25:04.048
You got it.

25:44.489 --> 25:46.991
All right. Here...

26:24.962 --> 26:26.331
Bryan,

26:27.766 --> 26:30.134
did you get any sleep?

26:30.202 --> 26:31.936
I, uh...

26:32.002 --> 26:33.538
I don't think
McMillian did it.

26:35.440 --> 26:37.209
The State based
its entire case

26:37.275 --> 26:40.379
on the testimony of one man.
Ralph Myers.

26:40.445 --> 26:42.848
Myers spent most of his life
in and out of prison.

26:42.913 --> 26:44.216
When he testified,

26:44.282 --> 26:45.517
he was on trial
for a different murder,

26:45.584 --> 26:47.652
which he ended up
getting 30 years for.

26:47.719 --> 26:49.120
Seems like a pretty good deal.

26:49.187 --> 26:50.389
In his statement,
he said that

26:50.455 --> 26:51.956
Johnny D. approached him
at a car wash

26:52.022 --> 26:53.492
and forced him at gunpoint

26:53.558 --> 26:56.795
to drive to Jackson Cleaners
because his arm hurt.

26:56.862 --> 26:58.196
That sounds logical.

26:58.263 --> 26:59.598
When they get there,
Johnny D. tells him

26:59.664 --> 27:01.466
to wait in the truck
while he goes inside.

27:01.533 --> 27:03.568
And while he's waiting
for his kidnapper,

27:03.635 --> 27:05.604
he doesn't run,
he doesn't go to the police.

27:05.670 --> 27:08.973
Instead, he drives to the
liquor store for cigarettes,

27:09.039 --> 27:11.643
and then comes back
to the crime scene.

27:11.710 --> 27:12.910
Excuse me?

27:12.977 --> 27:15.012
Myers hears gunshots,
goes inside

27:15.079 --> 27:16.681
and sees the body
of Ronda Morrison

27:16.748 --> 27:18.216
lying on the ground, face up,

27:18.283 --> 27:20.385
and Johnny D.
standing over her with a gun

27:20.452 --> 27:23.921
with some older white guy
who he claimed was in charge.

27:23.988 --> 27:25.424
Anyone trying
to look for him?

27:25.490 --> 27:27.359
Exactly.

27:27.426 --> 27:30.829
Oh, wait. They have one other
witness to back his testimony.

27:30.896 --> 27:32.597
A young black man
named Bill Hooks.

27:32.664 --> 27:34.466
Says he saw Johnny D.'s
low-rider truck

27:34.533 --> 27:36.967
leaving the cleaners
around the time of the murder.

27:37.034 --> 27:38.537
And that's it.

27:38.603 --> 27:40.205
That's all they have.

27:41.273 --> 27:42.940
Hmm.

27:43.007 --> 27:46.678
So, an 18-year-old white girl
is murdered in broad daylight

27:46.745 --> 27:48.979
and the sheriff can't solve
the crime for how long?

27:49.046 --> 27:50.582
Almost a year.

27:50.649 --> 27:51.917
And then some other guy

27:51.982 --> 27:53.485
who's charged
with a different murder

27:53.552 --> 27:55.119
says that he can tell them
who did it

27:55.187 --> 27:57.189
if he gets a lower sentence.

27:57.255 --> 27:58.623
And the guy that
he says did it,

27:58.690 --> 28:00.926
happens to be a black man
from a poor community

28:00.991 --> 28:02.960
that no one would think
twice about.

28:06.932 --> 28:09.033
There's gotta be
more evidence than this.

28:10.235 --> 28:12.771
I want to set a meeting
with the DA.

28:12.838 --> 28:16.208
Tommy Chapman just took over
for Pearson a few months ago.

28:16.274 --> 28:18.343
He used to be
a public defender.

28:18.410 --> 28:20.612
Maybe he's not in line
with the rest of 'em.

28:36.595 --> 28:39.531
You visit
the Mockingbird Museum yet?

28:39.598 --> 28:40.932
Oh. No, ma'am.

28:40.998 --> 28:42.132
It's the old courthouse

28:42.200 --> 28:44.269
Harper Lee's daddy
used to work in.

28:44.336 --> 28:47.539
You can stand right where
Atticus Finch once stood.

28:51.075 --> 28:52.377
Mr. Stevenson?

28:52.444 --> 28:53.979
- I'm Tommy Chapman.
- Hey.

28:54.044 --> 28:55.079
- You find us okay?
- I did.

28:55.145 --> 28:56.882
- Good. Follow me.
- Yeah.

28:56.948 --> 28:58.550
Thank you, Tracy.

28:58.617 --> 29:01.051
A lot of people are very keen
to meet you, Mr. Stevenson.

29:01.118 --> 29:02.152
Oh, really?

29:02.220 --> 29:03.221
Well, you're a Harvard lawyer,

29:03.288 --> 29:04.823
who's moved to Alabama.

29:04.890 --> 29:07.192
You know, you start taking on
all these capital cases,

29:07.259 --> 29:08.393
people just wanna know

29:08.460 --> 29:11.128
what your intentions are,
I guess.

29:11.196 --> 29:12.864
We're just trying
to give legal assistance

29:12.931 --> 29:14.199
to people
who can't afford it.

29:14.266 --> 29:15.834
Well, legal assistance
is one thing,

29:15.901 --> 29:18.135
but trying to put convicted
murderers back on the street

29:18.203 --> 29:21.038
is something else entirely.

29:21.105 --> 29:22.440
Anyway,
you didn't come

29:22.507 --> 29:23.975
all the way down here
to talk about that.

29:24.041 --> 29:25.744
What can I do
for you today, Bryan?

29:25.810 --> 29:28.513
I wanted to speak to you
about Johnny D. McMillian.

29:28.580 --> 29:30.782
You know I wasn't part
of his prosecution, right?

29:30.849 --> 29:32.217
That was way before my time.

29:32.284 --> 29:34.386
And that's exactly
why I wanted to meet you.

29:34.452 --> 29:36.388
You see, I've read through the
record quite a few times now

29:36.454 --> 29:37.689
and I have some serious doubts

29:37.756 --> 29:40.124
about the reliability
of his conviction.

29:41.860 --> 29:43.127
If you could take a look

29:43.194 --> 29:44.629
at the sections
I've highlighted here,

29:44.696 --> 29:48.700
you'll see some problems
with Ralph Myers' testimony.

29:48.767 --> 29:52.771
Man, this is one of
the most outrageous crimes

29:52.837 --> 29:55.407
in Monroe County history.

29:55.473 --> 29:58.176
Your client made
a lot of people very angry.

29:58.843 --> 30:00.245
I understand that,

30:00.312 --> 30:01.913
but there are some serious
problems with this case.

30:01.980 --> 30:03.782
And I was hoping
that I can get your support

30:03.848 --> 30:06.818
to figure out
what really happened.

30:06.885 --> 30:08.653
I already know what happened.

30:11.790 --> 30:14.359
Johnny D. McMillian
was convicted by a jury

30:14.426 --> 30:16.561
of brutally murdering
a teenage girl

30:16.628 --> 30:17.629
in my community.

30:17.696 --> 30:18.863
And it is my job

30:18.930 --> 30:21.900
to defend the integrity
of that conviction.

30:21.967 --> 30:25.737
Even if that conviction
is based on false testimony?

30:25.804 --> 30:27.906
You're the only one I know
who thinks that.

30:27.973 --> 30:30.075
Then I must be the only one
who read that record

30:30.140 --> 30:32.611
because it's pretty obvious.

30:36.748 --> 30:39.584
That man caused
a lot of pain.

30:39.651 --> 30:43.153
A lot of pain
for folks around here.

30:43.221 --> 30:45.991
And if you go digging
in those wounds,

30:46.057 --> 30:50.462
you're gonna be making
a lot of people very unhappy.

30:50.528 --> 30:52.631
Well, it isn't my job
to make people happy.

30:52.697 --> 30:55.600
It's to achieve justice
for my client.

30:59.638 --> 31:00.805
Well...

31:02.574 --> 31:04.342
Ralph Myers' two confessions

31:04.409 --> 31:07.412
and a statement
from Bill Hooks.

31:09.047 --> 31:10.315
I asked for copies

31:10.382 --> 31:11.883
of all the police
and witness statements.

31:11.950 --> 31:13.284
That's what you're holding.

31:13.351 --> 31:14.819
This is a joke.
Where's the rest of it?

31:14.886 --> 31:17.188
That's what's relevant
to the McMillian case.

31:17.255 --> 31:18.590
If you want more,
you'll have to file

31:18.657 --> 31:20.225
a discovery motion
with the court,

31:20.291 --> 31:22.661
just like anybody else.

31:22.727 --> 31:25.597
Thanks for coming by today,
Mr. Stevenson.

31:27.032 --> 31:28.233
Expect that motion soon.

31:28.299 --> 31:31.236
I'll look forward to it,
Counselor.

31:31.302 --> 31:33.838
You oughta check out
the Mockingbird Museum

31:33.905 --> 31:35.473
on your way out of town.

31:35.540 --> 31:37.709
It's one of the great
civil rights landmarks

31:37.776 --> 31:38.777
of the South.

31:40.645 --> 31:41.846
Hmm.

31:53.925 --> 31:55.326
Keep in line.

32:01.099 --> 32:02.267
Helping a black man

32:02.333 --> 32:03.568
convicted of killing
a white girl

32:03.635 --> 32:05.236
is political suicide
in that county.

32:05.303 --> 32:06.571
I'm sure he's being
reminded of that

32:06.638 --> 32:08.206
by whoever got him his job.

32:08.273 --> 32:09.474
The way he was talking,

32:09.541 --> 32:10.942
I don't even think
he read the record.

32:11.009 --> 32:12.444
That doesn't surprise me.

32:12.510 --> 32:16.281
Hey, Kris, Bobby,
come on in and get your snack.

32:16.347 --> 32:17.549
Okay.

32:17.615 --> 32:18.650
I'm gonna stop
by Jackson Cleaners

32:18.717 --> 32:20.385
on my way to meet his family.

32:20.452 --> 32:22.220
<i>Okay. If I don't hear
from you by morning,</i>

32:22.287 --> 32:23.421
I'll send a rescue party.

32:23.488 --> 32:26.958
- <i>I hope that's a joke.</i>
- Me, too.

32:27.025 --> 32:28.827
But just be careful, okay?

33:48.640 --> 33:49.974
That's him.

33:51.109 --> 33:53.245
- You the lawyer?
- Yes, ma'am.

33:53.311 --> 33:54.746
My name is Bryan Stevenson.

33:54.813 --> 33:57.148
I'm Johnny D.'s wife, Minnie.

33:57.216 --> 33:58.583
Pleasure to meet you.

34:01.419 --> 34:03.087
Hmm.

34:03.154 --> 34:05.890
Thank you so much for driving
all the way out here.

34:05.957 --> 34:09.928
Most lawyers
barely make time to call.

34:09.994 --> 34:14.699
This is our younger son, John.
Our baby girl, Jackie.

34:14.766 --> 34:17.368
I hope you don't mind,
a few of our neighbors

34:17.435 --> 34:19.205
stopped by to hear
what you got to say.

34:19.271 --> 34:22.208
Oh. Just a few?

34:22.274 --> 34:23.408
Come on. You'll be all right.

34:23.474 --> 34:24.342
Okay.

34:30.148 --> 34:33.952
Hey, now,
we ain't gonna get nowhere

34:34.018 --> 34:37.289
with everybody quacking
at the same time.

34:37.355 --> 34:39.591
Now, let Mr. Stevenson talk.

34:41.525 --> 34:42.760
Um...

34:42.827 --> 34:45.964
It's a pleasure
to meet all of you.

34:47.498 --> 34:48.833
Thank you.

34:50.001 --> 34:52.170
Now, I know you all
have a lot of questions,

34:52.237 --> 34:54.572
but I really would love
to hear from you guys first,

34:54.639 --> 34:56.440
just to get
a better understanding

34:56.507 --> 34:58.310
of your perspective on things.

34:58.376 --> 35:00.378
Our perspective is
ain't no way

35:00.445 --> 35:02.380
Johnny D. did this crime.

35:03.715 --> 35:05.750
The morning
that girl was killed,

35:05.817 --> 35:07.752
we was all having
a fish fry here

35:07.819 --> 35:10.121
to raise money
for the church.

35:10.189 --> 35:11.589
Johnny D. was here.

35:11.656 --> 35:12.991
Morning till night.

35:13.057 --> 35:15.026
Working on his truck
with John.

35:16.594 --> 35:18.596
You were with your dad
that day?

35:18.663 --> 35:20.266
Yeah, we was up
at 6:00 in the morning

35:20.332 --> 35:21.666
to put the truck on the rack.

35:21.733 --> 35:23.101
Jimmy was there, too.

35:23.167 --> 35:28.374
Yep. We had that tranny
cleaned out by 9:30.

35:28.439 --> 35:30.775
Now,
how he supposed to kidnap

35:30.842 --> 35:34.346
some crazy white man
all the way in Evergreen,

35:34.412 --> 35:36.547
then drive back
to Jackson Cleaners

35:36.614 --> 35:38.716
to kill that girl at 10:15

35:38.783 --> 35:40.718
if his truck ain't got
no transmission?

35:40.785 --> 35:41.786
Hello.

35:44.356 --> 35:47.425
How many of you all were
with Walter that morning?

35:55.667 --> 35:58.469
My husband could have never
done this, no kind of way.

35:58.536 --> 36:00.004
Whether we was
with him or not,

36:00.071 --> 36:01.873
he is just not like that.

36:01.940 --> 36:03.309
Well, everybody know
they went after him

36:03.375 --> 36:04.442
'cause of that woman.

36:08.380 --> 36:09.580
Sorry, Minnie.

36:10.915 --> 36:12.184
It's okay.

36:13.419 --> 36:15.119
It ain't no secret.

36:17.021 --> 36:18.290
A few months
before the murder,

36:18.357 --> 36:19.691
Johnny D. got caught

36:19.757 --> 36:21.859
messing around with
a white woman in town.

36:21.926 --> 36:23.494
When her husband
find out about it,

36:23.561 --> 36:25.331
he made sure everybody knew.

36:25.397 --> 36:29.335
People started talking,
and the stories kept growing.

36:29.401 --> 36:31.035
He went from being a cheat,

36:31.102 --> 36:32.338
to a drug dealer,

36:32.404 --> 36:34.239
to head of the Dixie Mafia.

36:34.306 --> 36:36.442
So, by the time somebody
call him a murderer,

36:36.507 --> 36:38.177
ain't nobody thought twice
about it.

36:38.243 --> 36:40.011
They can call it
what they want,

36:40.078 --> 36:42.580
this is just another way
to lynch a black man.

36:42.647 --> 36:43.848
Amen.

36:44.416 --> 36:46.318
Amen.

36:46.385 --> 36:49.455
There ain't no excuse for what my
husband did to me and this family.

36:49.520 --> 36:51.656
Damn fool hurt me bad.

36:54.792 --> 36:57.862
But he still
the daddy of my kids.

36:57.929 --> 36:59.864
And I really don't know
what I'm supposed to tell them

36:59.931 --> 37:01.499
about staying out of trouble

37:01.566 --> 37:03.134
when you can be
in your own house,

37:03.202 --> 37:04.403
minding your own business,

37:04.470 --> 37:06.037
surrounded by
your entire family,

37:06.104 --> 37:08.773
and they still going to put
some murder on you.

37:08.840 --> 37:11.243
That's right.

37:11.310 --> 37:12.844
It's not just Dad.

37:14.346 --> 37:17.682
We feel like they put us all
on death row, too.

37:17.749 --> 37:20.084
Baby...

37:20.151 --> 37:23.621
I can only imagine the pain
that you're going through.

37:23.688 --> 37:25.123
But I'm gonna
do everything I can.

37:25.190 --> 37:27.426
The last lawyer was talking
just as big as you.

37:27.493 --> 37:28.693
John...

37:28.760 --> 37:31.397
Then they took
all our money and split.

37:31.463 --> 37:32.964
Why you different?

37:34.366 --> 37:38.370
Well, our organization
will cover all legal fees,

37:38.437 --> 37:42.040
so none of you will ever
have to pay a penny.

37:44.876 --> 37:46.345
Now, it's clear to me
that this trial

37:46.412 --> 37:48.679
was constructed with lies,

37:48.746 --> 37:51.250
and based off everything
that I've seen,

37:51.316 --> 37:52.518
I think we could build a case

37:52.583 --> 37:55.354
strong enough
to bring Johnny D. home.

37:55.421 --> 37:58.956
And I'm not gonna stop
until I've done that.

38:02.894 --> 38:06.931
Well, you seem like
good people to me.

38:06.998 --> 38:09.700
But Johnny D.'s the one
you gonna have to convince.

38:13.505 --> 38:14.939
I don't know
about the rest of y'all,

38:15.006 --> 38:18.444
but I was sold on,
"Y'all won't pay a penny."

38:19.844 --> 38:21.180
Amen.

38:27.553 --> 38:29.254
Mr. Stevenson?

38:29.321 --> 38:30.855
Call me Bryan.

38:31.457 --> 38:32.757
Okay.

38:34.393 --> 38:36.894
This is my friend, Darnell.

38:36.961 --> 38:39.130
He has something he wants
to talk to you about.

38:41.599 --> 38:42.967
Go on.

38:45.237 --> 38:47.772
I think I can prove
he's innocent.

38:49.674 --> 38:51.376
You heard of Bill Hooks,
right?

38:52.177 --> 38:53.178
Yeah.

38:53.245 --> 38:54.846
He testified that he saw
Johnny D.'s truck

38:54.912 --> 38:56.681
at the cleaners that morning.

38:56.747 --> 38:58.983
Bill didn't see shit.

38:59.050 --> 39:01.052
He made the whole thing up.

39:02.321 --> 39:03.688
How do you know that?

39:03.754 --> 39:04.989
'Cause I was with him.

39:05.056 --> 39:07.259
We was working
at the shop together.

39:08.327 --> 39:10.329
- The morning of the murder?
- Yes, sir.

39:10.395 --> 39:12.663
We was fixing the head gasket
on the Camaro

39:12.730 --> 39:14.065
from 8:00 in the morning

39:14.132 --> 39:16.868
till right after
we closed for lunch.

39:16.934 --> 39:20.004
He was right next to me when
them sirens was going off.

39:21.306 --> 39:22.807
Why would he lie?

39:22.874 --> 39:25.710
'Cause the snitch
cut a deal with the cops.

39:25.776 --> 39:27.346
They had him locked up
for burglary.

39:27.412 --> 39:29.414
And the day he give his
statement, he walk out free.

39:29.481 --> 39:31.115
All charges dropped.

39:31.183 --> 39:32.650
We told
one of the other lawyers,

39:32.717 --> 39:34.586
and they ain't do nothing
about it.

39:34.652 --> 39:36.455
Hmm.

39:36.522 --> 39:39.224
Would you be willing to sign a
statement we could use in court?

39:43.928 --> 39:46.164
Police will see my name?

39:48.500 --> 39:50.768
It'd be on the record.

39:52.471 --> 39:57.808
Darnell, exposing yourself
like this is not easy.

39:57.875 --> 39:59.311
But with your testimony,

39:59.378 --> 40:02.314
we can file a motion
to reopen Johnny D.'s case.

40:04.216 --> 40:05.417
Darnell,

40:06.784 --> 40:08.420
we need you.

40:12.624 --> 40:14.692
Okay, yeah.

40:16.495 --> 40:17.929
Yeah, that'll do it.

40:18.729 --> 40:20.031
All right.

40:37.282 --> 40:38.749
Good morning.

40:38.816 --> 40:40.751
Good morning.

40:40.818 --> 40:43.020
- Thanks for seeing me again.
- Mmm-hmm.

40:45.490 --> 40:47.226
I know the last time we met,

40:47.292 --> 40:48.793
things didn't go
quite the way I was...

40:48.859 --> 40:51.729
I can't believe
you met my family.

40:53.030 --> 40:54.633
Drove down that dirt road,

40:54.700 --> 40:56.301
crammed up
in that little house,

40:56.368 --> 40:57.636
talked to all my people,

40:57.703 --> 41:00.171
say you gonna try
to fight for me.

41:04.676 --> 41:06.311
That mean a lot.

41:08.580 --> 41:10.781
It meant a lot to me, too.

41:12.417 --> 41:13.485
Oh, uh...

41:14.885 --> 41:17.788
Minnie wanted me
to give this to you.

41:20.791 --> 41:22.059
And if you don't mind,

41:22.126 --> 41:24.429
I have something
I wanna show you.

41:26.831 --> 41:29.066
It's a statement
from Darnell Houston,

41:29.133 --> 41:30.935
saying that
he was with Bill Hooks

41:31.002 --> 41:33.238
three miles away
at the time of the murder.

41:33.305 --> 41:35.940
So, there's no way he could
have seen your truck there.

41:36.007 --> 41:37.609
That's good, right?

41:37.676 --> 41:39.411
That's very good.

41:39.478 --> 41:42.780
I'm gonna submit this with
a motion for a new trial.

41:50.188 --> 41:52.156
I know you talked to,
uh, Minnie.

41:52.224 --> 41:55.260
She told you
what I did to her.

41:55.327 --> 41:57.262
I ain't got no excuse
for cheating on a woman

41:57.329 --> 42:00.097
good as that one,
good as she been to me.

42:01.266 --> 42:03.934
I don't know why
she's standing by me.

42:04.001 --> 42:05.237
She's standing by you

42:05.304 --> 42:07.406
because she knows
you shouldn't be in here.

42:08.340 --> 42:10.041
And so do I.

42:11.543 --> 42:14.045
I know you didn't kill
Ronda Morrison.

42:14.111 --> 42:17.582
And I can help you prove that
in court if you'll let me.

42:24.822 --> 42:26.924
You know, you done met
my whole family.

42:26.991 --> 42:29.528
You know everything about 'em.

42:29.594 --> 42:32.129
I don't know nothing
about you, though.

42:32.197 --> 42:34.098
- What would you like to know?
- I wanna know it all.

42:34.165 --> 42:38.035
Like why you...
Why you doing this?

42:38.102 --> 42:39.471
- Why am I a lawyer?
- No, no, no.

42:39.538 --> 42:41.273
Why is you a lawyer
down here in Alabama,

42:41.340 --> 42:44.909
taking these cases that ain't
nobody gonna pay you for?

42:52.484 --> 42:55.320
I grew up down a road
just like yours.

42:56.521 --> 42:59.558
I played soccer
in a dirt field

42:59.624 --> 43:01.226
with the pigs and chickens.

43:02.594 --> 43:05.230
Used to pump sewage
from my yard.

43:09.133 --> 43:12.002
When I was a teenager,
my grandfather was murdered

43:12.069 --> 43:14.138
over a black-and-white TV.

43:16.274 --> 43:19.211
We kept waiting for someone
to show up to help.

43:21.413 --> 43:23.013
They never did.

43:24.949 --> 43:27.285
And that's when
I realized that,

43:27.352 --> 43:30.054
outside my community,
nobody cared.

43:31.390 --> 43:33.592
'Cause to them,
he's just another black man

43:33.658 --> 43:35.293
killed in the projects.

43:39.431 --> 43:41.366
I know what it's like
to be in the shadows.

43:44.302 --> 43:46.405
That's why I'm doing this.

43:49.940 --> 43:51.942
That's a pretty good reason.

44:01.386 --> 44:02.554
Okay.

44:04.989 --> 44:06.425
Okay...

44:08.860 --> 44:10.462
Let's get to work.

44:13.598 --> 44:14.999
Okay.

44:31.416 --> 44:34.118
- Hey, yo, Johnny D.?
- Mmm-hmm?

44:34.186 --> 44:36.288
You signing up
with that lawyer?

44:36.354 --> 44:37.988
I'm gonna give him a try.

44:38.055 --> 44:41.493
Seem like everybody on the
row working with him now.

44:41.560 --> 44:43.595
I'm starting
to feel left out.

44:44.696 --> 44:46.598
Is he really that good?

44:48.400 --> 44:50.034
I hope so.

44:50.100 --> 44:51.536
What you think, Herbert?

44:51.603 --> 44:54.372
Should I just dump my guy
and make the switch over?

44:57.776 --> 44:59.311
Herb, you hear me?

45:00.044 --> 45:01.446
You there?

45:03.215 --> 45:04.583
I'm here.

45:06.218 --> 45:07.719
Herb, you okay?

45:12.958 --> 45:16.060
They set my date.

45:23.602 --> 45:25.169
Look here, Herb,
don't you worry about nothing now.

45:25.237 --> 45:28.038
Everything gonna be a'ight.
Okay?

45:28.105 --> 45:29.608
Ain't nothing over yet.

45:29.674 --> 45:31.943
You got Bryan
working for you now.

45:33.678 --> 45:36.080
I ain't...
I ain't like you guys.

45:36.146 --> 45:38.148
I deserve what's coming.

45:38.216 --> 45:41.118
All right, now, see, Herb...

45:41.186 --> 45:44.422
there you go
talking out your ass.

45:44.489 --> 45:47.392
Now, you fought
for this country.

45:47.459 --> 45:50.060
And they threw you in the bag
like the trash.

45:51.363 --> 45:54.533
That war made you sick
in your head, man.

45:54.599 --> 45:57.502
You supposed to be
in the hospital.

45:57.569 --> 45:58.770
Not here.

46:02.641 --> 46:06.143
When I told the cops that
stopped me I was innocent,

46:06.211 --> 46:08.213
do you know what they said?

46:10.147 --> 46:12.116
"One of you niggers did it

46:12.984 --> 46:15.119
and if it wasn't you,

46:15.186 --> 46:17.322
then you taking one
for your homie."

46:19.558 --> 46:23.261
Johnny D. prosecutor say
he know he killed the girl,

46:23.328 --> 46:27.465
because of the way
he looked in his mug shot.

46:27.532 --> 46:30.669
You don't deserve this shit
more than any of us, Herb.

46:33.972 --> 46:37.208
A girl is dead
because of me.

46:40.779 --> 46:43.748
That don't give nobody
the right to kill you back.

46:47.052 --> 46:49.955
<i>Herbert was 18
when he went to Vietnam.</i>

46:50.021 --> 46:51.289
He was the only survivor

46:51.356 --> 46:53.992
in an ambush that killed
his whole platoon.

46:54.059 --> 46:55.961
After that, he had
a mental breakdown,

46:56.027 --> 46:57.329
attempted suicide,

46:57.395 --> 46:59.564
and was sent home
on an honorable discharge.

46:59.631 --> 47:02.701
Back at home, he continued
to suffer from nightmares,

47:02.767 --> 47:04.168
crying fits,

47:04.235 --> 47:05.437
running out of his house,

47:05.503 --> 47:08.206
screaming "incoming"
to his neighbors.

47:08.273 --> 47:10.174
His lawyer didn't even mention
military service,

47:10.241 --> 47:11.876
or mental trauma to the jury.

47:11.943 --> 47:13.078
A few months
after the trial,

47:13.143 --> 47:15.112
he was disbarred
for misconduct.

47:15.180 --> 47:16.581
'Course he was.

47:19.050 --> 47:21.920
Okay, what can we do?

47:21.987 --> 47:24.422
Well, since he's already been
through the appeals process,

47:24.489 --> 47:25.857
the statute of limitations

47:25.924 --> 47:28.560
is gonna make it hard
for a judge to listen.

47:30.362 --> 47:32.063
We're gonna have to try
and make him.

47:33.398 --> 47:35.165
I'll get started
on the motion tonight.

47:35.233 --> 47:36.768
- Hello?
- Okay.

47:38.069 --> 47:39.437
It's for you, Mom.

47:39.504 --> 47:42.607
Oh, thank you, sweetie.
Hello?

47:42.674 --> 47:44.075
<i>You the bitch</i>

47:44.141 --> 47:46.077
<i>working for that
nigger lawyer?</i>

47:46.143 --> 47:47.612
Who the hell is this?

47:47.679 --> 47:49.314
<i>The guy who put the bomb
under your house,</i>

47:49.381 --> 47:51.016
<i>gonna blow your family
all to hell,</i>

47:51.082 --> 47:53.418
<i>if you don't stop working
for that nigger Johnny D.</i>

47:55.086 --> 47:56.354
Everybody, out of the house.

47:56.421 --> 47:58.623
- What's going on?
- I'll tell you outside.

48:16.574 --> 48:18.643
They didn't find anything.

48:19.277 --> 48:21.146
And they're sure?

48:21.212 --> 48:22.881
They said they're sure.

48:22.947 --> 48:24.649
They checked the
basement, too, like you said?

48:24.716 --> 48:25.950
Said they checked
the basement.

48:26.017 --> 48:27.218
Okay.

48:28.586 --> 48:30.689
All right,
we're gonna move on now.

48:33.925 --> 48:37.028
Okay, baby,
let's get you to bed.

48:37.095 --> 48:38.430
Yo, come on.

48:46.971 --> 48:49.908
When you asked me
to do this thing with you...

48:51.743 --> 48:55.480
I knew that
I'd lose some friends.

48:56.848 --> 48:59.918
Have people talk shit
behind my back,

48:59.984 --> 49:01.820
or to my face.

49:03.688 --> 49:04.989
I don't need people
to like me,

49:05.056 --> 49:07.459
as long as I'm doing
what I'm supposed to do.

49:11.396 --> 49:13.865
But threatening my family...

49:17.769 --> 49:21.339
Eva, you know I'd...
I'd never blame you

49:21.406 --> 49:23.575
if you needed to stop.

49:26.344 --> 49:27.779
I don't want my son
growing up

49:27.846 --> 49:30.615
knowing that his mom
stopped doing what was right

49:30.682 --> 49:34.018
just because she was scared
of some crazy bigot.

49:39.891 --> 49:41.593
Okay?

49:41.659 --> 49:44.295
What are we gonna do
about McMillian?

49:48.366 --> 49:51.770
We start the investigation
from scratch.

49:51.836 --> 49:54.906
Find anyone in town
who's willing to talk.

49:56.641 --> 49:58.643
Maybe people will stop
trying to kill us

49:58.710 --> 50:01.679
once they realize
how charming we are.

50:10.054 --> 50:12.390
I just wanted to
ask you a couple questions

50:12.457 --> 50:15.160
about the Ronda Morrison
murder.

50:15.227 --> 50:16.828
It's just, uh...

50:16.895 --> 50:18.429
You were
on the witness list

50:18.496 --> 50:19.597
for the Ronda Morrison trial
a few years back.

50:19.664 --> 50:23.501
Sorry.
Can't help you with that.

50:23.568 --> 50:25.436
Is there anything,
anything at all that you feel

50:25.503 --> 50:26.971
- comfortable talking about...
- You know, look...

50:27.038 --> 50:29.474
if you are not working
for that poor girl's family,

50:29.541 --> 50:31.142
then I ain't got nothing
to say to you.

50:31.210 --> 50:32.744
Sorry, sweetie.

50:34.379 --> 50:35.980
Officer Ikner?

50:37.081 --> 50:39.584
I ain't no officer no more.

50:39.651 --> 50:42.320
I'm a lawyer representing
Johnny D. McMillian.

50:42.387 --> 50:45.657
I understand you were the
first officer on the scene.

50:51.129 --> 50:52.497
<i>I was right.</i>

50:52.564 --> 50:54.699
The fish fry was on Saturday,
November 1st.

50:54.766 --> 50:56.302
The same day as the murder.

50:56.367 --> 50:57.602
They put these up
all over town.

50:59.704 --> 51:02.407
I could kiss you, Deb.

51:07.445 --> 51:09.013
<i>We're planning
to grow this into something</i>

51:09.080 --> 51:11.049
<i>the whole country
will be talking about.</i>

51:11.115 --> 51:15.153
And you can say that it all
started in your building.

51:15.221 --> 51:18.423
What exactly kind of work
do you do?

51:19.457 --> 51:21.359
We're just helping people.

51:27.065 --> 51:28.733
- It looks good.
- It's perfect.

51:28.800 --> 51:30.034
My client, Herbert Richardson,

51:30.101 --> 51:31.469
was recommended
for a Medal of Valor

51:31.536 --> 51:32.971
for disarming a bomb
in Vietnam.

51:33.037 --> 51:35.039
We got a tip that
a few of your employees

51:35.106 --> 51:36.275
could back his alibi.

51:36.342 --> 51:37.775
Vivian Clark was
one of the teenagers

51:37.842 --> 51:39.911
who were sexually abused
at your facility.

51:39.978 --> 51:41.247
No, I'm not an attorney.

51:41.313 --> 51:43.915
But I promise you, your son
is in very good hands.

51:46.417 --> 51:48.553
We'll let you know.

51:48.620 --> 51:50.521
Good talking to you.

51:52.123 --> 51:55.026
Equal Justice Initiative.
This is Brenda.

51:55.093 --> 51:59.130
Yeah. Okay. Yes. Uh-huh.
Just one moment.

51:59.198 --> 52:00.899
Darnell Houston.

52:03.335 --> 52:05.069
Hello, Darnell?

52:06.372 --> 52:09.874
Whoa. Whoa, whoa. Slow down,
slow down, slow down.

52:10.608 --> 52:12.477
Where are you?

52:14.479 --> 52:18.583
- Are you okay?
- No, sir, I'm not.

52:18.650 --> 52:22.453
Okay, Darnell, let's go talk
in the car. Okay?

52:25.990 --> 52:28.559
How in the hell they locking
me up for perjury,

52:28.626 --> 52:31.696
if alls I did was
say the truth, hmm?

52:31.763 --> 52:34.233
I knew I shouldn't have
signed that paper, man.

52:34.300 --> 52:35.667
Shouldn't have
listened to you.

52:35.733 --> 52:37.735
No. What they did to you
was completely illegal.

52:37.802 --> 52:38.937
Okay? Now, I'm gonna
talk to the DA

52:39.003 --> 52:40.538
and get all these charges
dismissed.

52:40.605 --> 52:41.906
This will never happen again.

52:41.973 --> 52:44.410
Well, how the hell
do you know, hmm?

52:44.475 --> 52:46.778
You can't control these guys.

52:46.844 --> 52:49.580
They arrested me
in the middle of my shift,

52:49.647 --> 52:51.115
in front of my boss.

52:51.183 --> 52:54.186
I don't even know
if I got a job tomorrow.

52:59.157 --> 53:02.627
I feel bad, what they doing
to Johnny D...

53:04.696 --> 53:07.098
but I'm just trying
to survive.

53:08.700 --> 53:11.236
I can't fight these guys, man.

53:12.470 --> 53:14.138
Go on and find somebody else.

53:14.206 --> 53:18.042
Listen, Darnell.
Think about Johnny D., okay?

53:18.109 --> 53:20.578
Think about his family.
They need you.

53:20.645 --> 53:22.814
Give me some time
to work on this.

53:30.389 --> 53:32.191
That's my ride.

53:33.491 --> 53:35.827
Tell Johnny D. I'm sorry.

54:09.794 --> 54:11.662
I need to speak with you.

54:12.830 --> 54:15.066
Oh, hey, Bryan.

54:16.268 --> 54:18.102
Have you met Sheriff Tate?

54:20.738 --> 54:23.308
Who ordered the arrest
of my witness?

54:23.375 --> 54:25.344
When people make
false statements

54:25.411 --> 54:26.611
concerning this case,

54:26.677 --> 54:27.845
they're gonna
be held accountable.

54:27.912 --> 54:29.481
You can't arrest someone
for perjury

54:29.547 --> 54:31.450
without evidence that a false
statement has been made.

54:31.517 --> 54:34.453
Hang on. Are you representing
Mr. Houston now, too?

54:34.520 --> 54:36.020
Yes, I am.

54:36.087 --> 54:38.089
His statement contradicts
Bill Hooks' entire testimony.

54:38.156 --> 54:40.691
Hooks ain't the State's main witness.
Ralph Myers is.

54:40.758 --> 54:43.027
Alabama Code 12-21-222

54:43.094 --> 54:45.730
requires corroboration
of accomplice testimony.

54:45.797 --> 54:46.964
So, without Hooks,

54:47.031 --> 54:48.900
the conviction
wouldn't be valid.

54:51.403 --> 54:52.637
You know, I went down to see

54:52.703 --> 54:55.139
Ronda Morrison's momma
yesterday.

54:55.873 --> 54:57.209
And she's in tears.

54:57.276 --> 55:00.546
She kept asking me why
some lawyer from up north

55:00.611 --> 55:01.913
would come down here

55:01.979 --> 55:05.049
and make them relive
all this hell again.

55:05.116 --> 55:06.552
Well, you can tell her
it's because

55:06.617 --> 55:08.086
Johnny D. didn't kill
her daughter.

55:08.152 --> 55:09.188
And whoever did

55:09.254 --> 55:11.622
- is still out there somewhere.
- Mmm-hmm.

55:12.757 --> 55:16.295
I know how desperate
you must be

55:16.361 --> 55:20.598
to fulfill your fantasy
of who we are down here.

55:20.665 --> 55:22.934
Just a bunch of corrupt
Southern racists

55:23.000 --> 55:25.069
framing niggers for murder.

55:25.136 --> 55:27.972
And you here to save the day.

55:28.039 --> 55:30.975
Well, hell, you can believe
that if you want to,

55:31.042 --> 55:33.378
but I know that
Johnny D. killed that girl,

55:33.445 --> 55:35.046
and he's gonna answer for it.

55:35.113 --> 55:38.850
And how do you know that?
You have no hard evidence.

55:38.916 --> 55:40.118
You based your entire case

55:40.185 --> 55:41.353
on the word
of an indicted felon,

55:41.420 --> 55:42.588
who had every incentive

55:42.653 --> 55:43.888
to tell you
what you wanted to hear.

55:43.955 --> 55:45.690
Ralph Myers testified
on his own accord.

55:45.756 --> 55:47.392
And it made no sense.

55:47.459 --> 55:51.230
He couldn't finish a sentence
without contradicting himself.

55:51.296 --> 55:53.731
Now, the charges against
Darnell Houston are baseless.

55:53.798 --> 55:55.933
They'll never stand up
in court.

55:56.000 --> 55:58.370
They should be
dropped immediately.

56:02.574 --> 56:04.209
Okay.

56:05.877 --> 56:07.979
Is that okay with you, Tommy?

56:08.045 --> 56:09.714
Sure.

56:09.780 --> 56:11.350
Well, it doesn't
really matter,

56:11.416 --> 56:14.386
now the court denied your
motion to reopen the case.

56:15.320 --> 56:17.088
Wait, what was that?

56:17.155 --> 56:19.991
Oh, you didn't get the order?

56:20.057 --> 56:21.792
Well, the judge is down
in Mobile now,

56:21.859 --> 56:25.029
so, you know, sometimes
they have mail issues.

56:25.096 --> 56:26.831
Listen, you can tell
Mr. Houston

56:26.898 --> 56:28.132
the charges against him
are being dropped.

56:28.200 --> 56:29.901
I can do that much for y'all,

56:29.967 --> 56:32.437
but anything else will have
to be raised on appeal.

56:39.010 --> 56:41.313
Thanks
for stopping by, Counselor.

57:23.020 --> 57:24.590
Something wrong, Officer?

57:24.656 --> 57:26.824
Step out of the vehicle.

57:26.891 --> 57:29.894
I don't understand.
I wasn't speeding.

57:29.961 --> 57:31.896
I said
step out of the vehicle.

57:32.631 --> 57:33.965
I'll get out of the car,

57:34.031 --> 57:37.236
but first can you tell me
why you stopped me?

57:37.302 --> 57:38.769
- Get out of the goddamn car!
- Whoa!

57:38.836 --> 57:40.905
Whoa, whoa.
Okay, okay. Hold on.

57:40.972 --> 57:42.173
- Come on!
- Okay.

57:42.241 --> 57:43.841
Okay. I'm taking off
my seat belt.

57:43.908 --> 57:44.909
Get it! Come on!

57:44.976 --> 57:46.143
Okay. I'm opening up the door.

57:46.211 --> 57:47.379
- I'm stepping out.
- Faster! Come on!

57:47.446 --> 57:48.580
Okay. I have nothing
in my hands.

57:48.647 --> 57:49.814
Turn around!

57:49.880 --> 57:52.083
- Yes. Okay. Okay.
- Hands on the car!

57:58.523 --> 58:00.791
You don't have to have
the gun pointed at me.

58:00.858 --> 58:01.859
I'm not a threat.

58:01.926 --> 58:04.795
Shut your damn mouth, boy.

58:04.862 --> 58:06.964
Hey, brother...

58:07.031 --> 58:08.799
you ought to be careful
with your words

58:08.866 --> 58:10.835
when you got a gun
at your head.

58:14.573 --> 58:15.741
Let's go, John.

58:24.949 --> 58:26.451
Why did you stop me?

58:26.518 --> 58:28.320
We're letting you go.

58:29.488 --> 58:31.256
You should be happy.

58:58.350 --> 59:00.885
Even if they drop
them charges,

59:00.951 --> 59:02.754
Darnell ain't gonna testify

59:02.820 --> 59:04.189
after what they done
done to him.

59:06.057 --> 59:08.660
I know we took a big hit.
We did. But we just need

59:08.727 --> 59:10.362
to gather more evidence
for another motion.

59:10.429 --> 59:12.397
No, no. They gonna block it.
They gonna block it.

59:12.464 --> 59:15.767
If they can put me on the row
for a year without no trial,

59:15.833 --> 59:18.303
they can do
whatever they wanna do.

59:18.370 --> 59:20.505
They put you on death row
before your trial?

59:20.572 --> 59:22.106
Yeah.

59:22.173 --> 59:23.874
Sheriff drove me himself.

59:23.941 --> 59:25.943
Said, "I'm gonna give you a
little taste of what it's like

59:26.010 --> 59:29.080
unless you confess."

59:29.146 --> 59:30.649
Why are you
just now telling me this?

59:30.716 --> 59:33.452
This is how it is down here.

59:33.518 --> 59:36.588
Been like this
long as I can remember.

59:44.229 --> 59:46.631
They messing with you,
ain't they?

59:50.402 --> 59:53.938
Yeah, they are. They're not
making it easy on me.

59:56.241 --> 59:58.410
I got a plan for you, though.

59:59.143 --> 01:00:00.412
I'm all ears.

01:00:01.879 --> 01:00:03.147
Here's what I think
we should do.

01:00:03.215 --> 01:00:06.150
I think you should
train up another lawyer,

01:00:06.218 --> 01:00:07.352
'cause I'm gonna need somebody

01:00:07.419 --> 01:00:10.622
just in case
they take you out.

01:00:10.689 --> 01:00:13.558
Oh, it's like that?

01:00:13.625 --> 01:00:16.127
Like that. It's like that.

01:00:16.194 --> 01:00:17.829
Thought I had a friend.

01:00:17.895 --> 01:00:19.598
Ain't no friends in here.

01:00:19.664 --> 01:00:20.532
Cold world.

01:00:20.599 --> 01:00:21.566
Yeah.

01:00:24.636 --> 01:00:26.904
So, we ain't got Darnell.

01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:29.907
What's the next move?

01:00:33.678 --> 01:00:36.046
I think we should talk
to Ralph Myers.

01:00:40.017 --> 01:00:41.253
- Walter...
- No.

01:00:41.319 --> 01:00:43.455
Just listen to me
for a second.

01:00:44.222 --> 01:00:46.157
I know it's risky,

01:00:46.224 --> 01:00:48.226
but the only way to find out
what he really knows

01:00:48.293 --> 01:00:50.195
is for me to get him talking.

01:00:51.061 --> 01:00:53.030
I know what he know.

01:00:55.065 --> 01:00:57.436
You know
what that man did to me?

01:00:59.036 --> 01:01:01.105
Took my life away from me...

01:01:02.207 --> 01:01:05.177
to save his own ass.

01:01:05.243 --> 01:01:07.712
All he gonna
give you is lies.

01:01:09.079 --> 01:01:11.516
I promise
I'm gonna be careful.

01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:21.259
Get in line.

01:01:39.878 --> 01:01:41.480
Mr. Myers.

01:01:42.614 --> 01:01:44.182
You Bobby?

01:01:44.950 --> 01:01:46.618
I'm Bryan.

01:01:47.652 --> 01:01:49.888
Maybe later.

01:01:49.955 --> 01:01:53.391
Okay. Do you wanna sit down?

01:01:53.458 --> 01:01:55.660
You gonna buy me
a Coke first?

01:01:55.727 --> 01:01:56.895
Or you gonna make me stare

01:01:56.962 --> 01:01:58.996
at them vending machines
all day?

01:02:00.198 --> 01:02:02.701
Sure. What do you want?

01:02:02.767 --> 01:02:04.603
Sunkist orange.

01:02:04.669 --> 01:02:05.904
Okay.

01:02:05.971 --> 01:02:08.507
And some Jujyfruits,
if they got 'em.

01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:14.646
I just want to say thanks
for meeting me, Mr. Myers.

01:02:24.890 --> 01:02:26.123
Can we start by talking about

01:02:26.191 --> 01:02:28.326
your testimony
against Johnny D.?

01:02:28.894 --> 01:02:30.228
No.

01:02:31.263 --> 01:02:33.965
I ain't talking about him.

01:02:34.031 --> 01:02:35.901
That's the only reason
why I'm here.

01:02:35.967 --> 01:02:38.236
You don't like it, leave.

01:02:40.137 --> 01:02:41.306
Oh, don't look so sad.

01:02:41.373 --> 01:02:42.641
We can talk
about other things.

01:02:42.707 --> 01:02:44.376
I love to talk.

01:02:44.442 --> 01:02:46.778
My wife says if I got paid
for every word I said,

01:02:46.845 --> 01:02:49.781
we'd be a couple
of billionaires by now.

01:02:52.116 --> 01:02:53.952
Oh, yeah?

01:02:54.019 --> 01:02:55.420
How long you been married?

01:02:55.487 --> 01:02:57.455
Long enough to pop out
a couple of kids,

01:02:57.522 --> 01:02:59.858
and watch her
turn 'em all against me.

01:02:59.925 --> 01:03:01.426
You got kids?

01:03:01.493 --> 01:03:02.661
Me? No.

01:03:03.662 --> 01:03:05.530
But Johnny D. does.

01:03:07.097 --> 01:03:07.999
Yeah.

01:03:08.065 --> 01:03:09.301
The thing about kids is

01:03:09.367 --> 01:03:11.336
they ain't nothing
like having a dog.

01:03:11.403 --> 01:03:12.904
It's a totally
different deal.

01:03:12.971 --> 01:03:16.241
I wish somebody had told me
that in the first place.

01:03:16.308 --> 01:03:19.578
And my kids, they think
they got it so bad.

01:03:19.644 --> 01:03:22.180
They ain't seen nothing
like I seen.

01:03:22.247 --> 01:03:24.749
Try making it as a foster kid
your whole life.

01:03:24.816 --> 01:03:26.918
As soon as you figure out
one shitty parent,

01:03:26.985 --> 01:03:29.254
they moving you to a new one.

01:03:32.156 --> 01:03:33.458
Uh...

01:03:33.525 --> 01:03:35.260
I'm sorry.

01:03:35.327 --> 01:03:37.462
I'm sure that wasn't easy.

01:03:42.801 --> 01:03:44.703
How many kids he got?

01:03:46.071 --> 01:03:48.138
Johnny D. has three.

01:03:51.676 --> 01:03:54.346
Mr. Myers, I know you made
a deal with the State.

01:03:54.412 --> 01:03:55.680
But I don't think
they told you

01:03:55.747 --> 01:03:57.582
Johnny D. was gonna die
because of it.

01:03:58.883 --> 01:04:02.187
That must not be
an easy thing to carry.

01:04:02.253 --> 01:04:03.421
And I'm hoping
there's a part of you

01:04:03.488 --> 01:04:05.724
that wants to
make things right.

01:04:09.761 --> 01:04:12.597
Can we please talk
about your testimony?

01:04:17.569 --> 01:04:19.437
Hey. Hey!

01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:31.282
From the day they moved
my ass into Escambia,

01:04:31.349 --> 01:04:32.584
for something I'm telling you

01:04:32.651 --> 01:04:34.953
I ain't had
nothing to do with,

01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:38.189
all them police wanted to talk
about was Ronda Morrison.

01:04:38.256 --> 01:04:40.091
It was Morrison this,
Morrison that.

01:04:40.157 --> 01:04:44.396
Sometimes four or five of 'em
in the room at the same time.

01:04:44.462 --> 01:04:46.163
They were questioning you
about her

01:04:46.231 --> 01:04:47.766
the day you were arrested?

01:04:50.268 --> 01:04:52.404
Alls I'm saying is,

01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:54.606
ain't nobody cared
about a damn thing

01:04:54.673 --> 01:04:56.341
besides who killed that girl.

01:04:56.408 --> 01:04:58.243
And when people care
about a thing that much,

01:04:58.309 --> 01:05:00.712
they'll do anything
to get what they want.

01:05:02.547 --> 01:05:03.782
You know they'll kill you

01:05:03.848 --> 01:05:05.450
if you get to the bottom
of this, right?

01:05:06.551 --> 01:05:08.153
Wait. Where are you going?

01:05:08.219 --> 01:05:10.155
We done here, Bobby.

01:05:10.221 --> 01:05:12.223
Thanks for the Jujys.

01:05:13.091 --> 01:05:15.694
Ready, boss.

01:05:17.862 --> 01:05:19.097
<i>Myers said
he was questioned</i>

01:05:19.164 --> 01:05:20.331
<i>about Ronda Morrison</i>

01:05:20.398 --> 01:05:21.933
the day he was arrested,
on June 3rd.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.768
But the only statement
they presented in court

01:05:23.835 --> 01:05:26.071
<i>was recorded
almost two months later.</i>

01:05:26.137 --> 01:05:29.741
Do you think they're hiding
his first statement somewhere?

01:05:29.808 --> 01:05:31.776
If they are, it might be
at the Escambia courthouse

01:05:31.843 --> 01:05:33.645
with the files
from his other case.

01:05:33.712 --> 01:05:35.947
<i>You know anyone over there?</i>

01:05:36.014 --> 01:05:37.582
I do.

01:05:41.386 --> 01:05:43.455
That's everything
we got on Myers.

01:05:43.521 --> 01:05:45.056
You can make copies
over there.

01:05:45.123 --> 01:05:47.525
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Sure, baby.

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:51.396
He's cute. Married?

01:05:51.463 --> 01:05:53.832
- Married to his work.
- Ugh.

01:05:53.898 --> 01:05:54.966
How's Uncle Mickey doing?

01:06:03.775 --> 01:06:04.776
Miss Miller.

01:06:05.643 --> 01:06:07.912
Can I take a copy of these?

01:06:07.979 --> 01:06:10.715
They ain't paying me enough
to stop you.

01:06:23.361 --> 01:06:27.398
Did you find the transcript
from Myers' first statement?

01:06:27.465 --> 01:06:30.301
- Yeah.
- Ah, thank you.

01:06:36.641 --> 01:06:37.642
What?

01:06:45.917 --> 01:06:47.253
<i>I understand that, Sheriff.</i>

01:06:47.318 --> 01:06:48.620
That's Myers.

01:06:48.686 --> 01:06:50.054
<i>And that's what
I'm trying to tell you.</i>

01:06:50.121 --> 01:06:52.724
<i>Because, I'm gonna
be honest with ya,</i>

01:06:52.791 --> 01:06:55.160
<i>I don't know a damn thing.</i>

01:06:55.227 --> 01:06:56.294
<i>Is that right?</i>

01:06:56.361 --> 01:06:57.529
And that's Tate.

01:06:57.595 --> 01:06:58.997
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

01:06:59.063 --> 01:07:01.032
<i>It's righter than anything
I've ever said.</i>

01:07:01.099 --> 01:07:03.301
<i>And you would
take a polygraph test</i>

01:07:03.368 --> 01:07:05.103
<i>to the fact that
you do not know</i>

01:07:05.170 --> 01:07:06.437
<i>who killed Ronda Morrison?</i>

01:07:06.504 --> 01:07:08.840
<i>That's right, sir.
I will.</i>

01:07:08.907 --> 01:07:11.342
<i>Would you face the person
who came in here and testified that you...</i>

01:07:11.409 --> 01:07:14.646
<i>I will face any damn
body in this world on that,</i>

01:07:14.712 --> 01:07:16.447
<i>because it's a stone lie.</i>

01:07:16.514 --> 01:07:20.018
<i>And if you asking me to frame
an innocent man for murder,</i>

01:07:20.084 --> 01:07:23.521
<i>well, that just ain't something
I'm willing to do.</i>

01:07:26.391 --> 01:07:27.892
Holy shit.

01:07:57.689 --> 01:07:59.991
Herb, you all right
over there?

01:08:02.393 --> 01:08:03.695
No.

01:08:05.496 --> 01:08:06.898
Now, listen here,

01:08:06.965 --> 01:08:08.600
you gonna have to get
your mind off tomorrow.

01:08:08.666 --> 01:08:11.603
Bryan is working on that
as we speak.

01:08:12.971 --> 01:08:14.672
Now, you know
how these courts here is.

01:08:14.739 --> 01:08:16.474
They wait
till the last minute,

01:08:16.541 --> 01:08:17.975
but you gonna get that stay.

01:08:18.042 --> 01:08:21.746
Why did I make that bomb?

01:08:21.813 --> 01:08:23.781
Herb,
don't go there now.

01:08:23.848 --> 01:08:25.317
Why'd I do that?

01:08:25.383 --> 01:08:28.220
I wasn't trying
to hurt nobody.

01:08:28.287 --> 01:08:30.121
Herb, I know.

01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:34.326
Why am I so stupid?

01:08:34.392 --> 01:08:36.328
No, no, you ain't stupid.

01:08:36.394 --> 01:08:38.029
That war got you sick,

01:08:38.095 --> 01:08:39.497
and you still sick.

01:08:39.564 --> 01:08:41.799
Girl wasn't supposed
to come by and pick it up.

01:08:41.866 --> 01:08:45.069
Listen, Herb. I want you to...

01:08:45.136 --> 01:08:47.238
She wasn't supposed to come by
and pick it up.

01:08:47.305 --> 01:08:50.242
This what we gonna do, Herb.
We gonna slow your mind down.

01:08:50.309 --> 01:08:52.243
Remember what
we practiced now.

01:08:52.310 --> 01:08:54.812
What we do?

01:08:54.879 --> 01:08:57.283
- Deep breaths.
- Yeah.

01:08:57.349 --> 01:08:59.184
Come on, do that with me now.

01:08:59.251 --> 01:09:01.551
Deep breaths.

01:09:04.256 --> 01:09:05.523
In and out.

01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:11.496
Now in.

01:09:13.497 --> 01:09:15.166
Now close your eyes.

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:18.736
Get away from all this.

01:09:20.238 --> 01:09:22.408
No more walls.

01:09:22.473 --> 01:09:24.176
No more guards.

01:09:25.676 --> 01:09:27.812
No more wars to fight.

01:09:29.913 --> 01:09:31.816
Just you, out in the open.

01:09:33.117 --> 01:09:34.852
Fresh air on your face.

01:09:41.591 --> 01:09:43.828
<i>Look at them pine trees.</i>

01:09:45.830 --> 01:09:48.733
<i>They've been growing
since 'fore we was born.</i>

01:09:51.002 --> 01:09:54.138
<i>And they gonna keep growing
even after we gone.</i>

01:09:57.075 --> 01:09:59.110
<i>And they done been through
the same shit</i>

01:09:59.178 --> 01:10:00.545
<i>we done been through.</i>

01:10:03.848 --> 01:10:06.551
<i>But they still dancing
in the breeze.</i>

01:10:16.127 --> 01:10:17.662
Can you see 'em?

01:10:20.031 --> 01:10:21.200
Yeah.

01:10:22.066 --> 01:10:23.167
Good.

01:10:24.936 --> 01:10:27.538
Now I want you to think
about nothing else.

01:10:27.605 --> 01:10:30.342
Just keep your mind on that.

01:10:30.409 --> 01:10:32.610
And everything
gonna be a'ight.

01:10:49.894 --> 01:10:51.596
I need
<i>Strickland v. Washington,</i>

01:10:51.662 --> 01:10:53.865
and the affidavit
from Herbert's sergeant.

01:11:09.448 --> 01:11:11.250
Let's send it.

01:11:18.122 --> 01:11:19.624
Now what?

01:11:22.327 --> 01:11:23.895
We wait.

01:11:44.383 --> 01:11:46.017
EJI.
This is Bryan Stevenson.

01:11:46.084 --> 01:11:47.652
<i>Mr. Stevenson,</i>

01:11:47.718 --> 01:11:49.388
<i>the court has
just entered an order</i>

01:11:49.455 --> 01:11:52.123
<i>in case number 895395.</i>

01:11:52.191 --> 01:11:54.025
<i>The motion
for a stay of execution</i>

01:11:54.092 --> 01:11:55.793
<i>and petition
for writ of certiorari</i>

01:11:55.860 --> 01:11:57.595
<i>have been denied.</i>

01:11:57.662 --> 01:12:00.365
<i>We'll fax copies of the order
over to your office shortly.</i>

01:12:02.568 --> 01:12:04.570
- Thank you.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

01:12:20.319 --> 01:12:22.287
He asked me to be there.

01:12:25.022 --> 01:12:26.157
Okay.

01:12:27.024 --> 01:12:28.327
I'll drive you, then.

01:12:41.172 --> 01:12:44.409
Come on, Herbert.
We gotta go.

01:13:06.130 --> 01:13:09.234
Can... Can I say bye
to my friends?

01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:28.152
When it get too much for you,

01:13:29.621 --> 01:13:31.822
you take them deep breaths.

01:13:32.823 --> 01:13:34.926
Let your mind go.

01:13:37.995 --> 01:13:41.799
Wish I didn't have
to do this alone.

01:13:43.734 --> 01:13:45.736
You ain't by yourself,
Herbert.

01:13:47.439 --> 01:13:49.106
We all with you.

01:13:51.108 --> 01:13:53.077
Ain't that right, Ray?

01:13:54.479 --> 01:13:58.115
That's right, Herb.
You ain't rid of us yet.

01:14:03.655 --> 01:14:06.123
You've been a good friend.

01:14:49.967 --> 01:14:51.802
First time
in the chamber, huh?

01:14:53.372 --> 01:14:54.539
Yeah.

01:14:54.606 --> 01:14:57.842
Don't think too much.
You'll lose your shit.

01:15:09.288 --> 01:15:11.956
Need anything,
Mr. Richardson?

01:15:13.558 --> 01:15:15.960
You still gonna play my song?

01:15:16.027 --> 01:15:17.962
Got it cued up and ready.

01:15:19.897 --> 01:15:21.366
Thank you.

01:15:34.179 --> 01:15:36.581
It's been a strange day.

01:15:39.083 --> 01:15:42.387
More people asked
how they can help me today

01:15:42.454 --> 01:15:45.190
than ever asked
in my whole life.

01:15:52.029 --> 01:15:54.165
Do I look funny?

01:15:56.067 --> 01:16:00.905
I ain't know they were gonna
shave off everything.

01:16:03.074 --> 01:16:04.975
You look fine.

01:16:16.788 --> 01:16:21.158
Well, most people don't get
to sit and think all day

01:16:21.226 --> 01:16:24.929
about it being
their last day alive.

01:16:27.199 --> 01:16:29.468
It's different than Nam.

01:16:30.702 --> 01:16:32.970
Least I had a chance there.

01:16:39.778 --> 01:16:41.313
I'm sorry.

01:16:46.050 --> 01:16:50.322
You the only one
cared enough to fight for me.

01:16:55.227 --> 01:16:57.596
Since I don't have family,

01:16:57.662 --> 01:17:00.799
I told the army
to send my flag to you,

01:17:00.866 --> 01:17:02.234
if that's okay.

01:17:07.506 --> 01:17:09.140
I'd be honored.

01:17:18.048 --> 01:17:20.951
Can you pray with me?

01:17:24.021 --> 01:17:25.524
Of course.

01:17:35.966 --> 01:17:37.269
They're ready.

01:20:29.674 --> 01:20:31.242
I'm walking with you,
Big Herb!

01:20:31.309 --> 01:20:32.911
Believe in your heart, Herb.

01:20:32.978 --> 01:20:34.546

01:20:34.613 --> 01:20:35.647

Hey.

01:23:11.469 --> 01:23:13.338
Well, I hope
this important news of yours

01:23:13.404 --> 01:23:14.405
comes with some food.

01:23:14.472 --> 01:23:16.341
'Cause I'm starving.

01:23:17.108 --> 01:23:19.444
Sit down, Mr. Myers.

01:23:21.813 --> 01:23:24.382
You was a lot nicer
the last time.

01:23:28.820 --> 01:23:30.555
I heard the recording
of the first statement

01:23:30.622 --> 01:23:32.423
you gave on June 3rd.

01:23:33.458 --> 01:23:35.627
The one they didn't
present in court.

01:23:37.662 --> 01:23:39.998
You told the sheriff
you didn't know anything

01:23:40.064 --> 01:23:42.901
about Johnny D. or the murder.

01:23:42.967 --> 01:23:45.470
You told him you didn't want
to frame an innocent man.

01:23:45.537 --> 01:23:47.539
Do you remember saying that?

01:23:49.140 --> 01:23:50.408
Now, what I'm wondering is,

01:23:50.475 --> 01:23:51.609
how do you go
from knowing nothing

01:23:51.676 --> 01:23:53.611
about a murder on June 3rd,

01:23:53.678 --> 01:23:55.346
to becoming
the State's key witness

01:23:55.413 --> 01:23:57.081
three months later?

01:23:57.148 --> 01:23:58.817
What changed your mind?

01:24:11.796 --> 01:24:13.598
What's that?

01:24:13.665 --> 01:24:16.100
Intake log
from Holman prison.

01:24:18.036 --> 01:24:19.804
On August 1st, 1987,

01:24:19.871 --> 01:24:22.740
Sheriff Tate
transferred two inmates

01:24:22.807 --> 01:24:26.044
from county jail
to death row.

01:24:27.246 --> 01:24:29.347
Johnny D...

01:24:32.417 --> 01:24:33.952
and you.

01:24:40.859 --> 01:24:42.360
Did they move you
to death row

01:24:42.427 --> 01:24:44.562
because you wouldn't testify
against him?

01:24:49.801 --> 01:24:51.337
They executed Wayne Ritter

01:24:51.402 --> 01:24:52.537
a few weeks
after you got there,

01:24:52.604 --> 01:24:53.872
isn't that right?

01:24:56.908 --> 01:24:58.843
I was in the witness room
when they killed

01:24:58.910 --> 01:25:01.012
Herbert Richardson
Thursday night.

01:25:02.447 --> 01:25:05.550
And it was the most
horrific thing

01:25:05.617 --> 01:25:07.619
I've ever experienced.

01:25:10.989 --> 01:25:14.926
I'm sure Ritter's execution
wasn't easy for you either.

01:25:32.010 --> 01:25:35.647
They put me in the cell
closest to the kill room.

01:25:38.650 --> 01:25:41.353
Middle of the night,
everybody started screaming,

01:25:41.419 --> 01:25:43.087
banging on the bars.

01:25:44.656 --> 01:25:45.990
And then...

01:25:50.229 --> 01:25:53.665
then came the smell
of his skin burning.

01:26:00.171 --> 01:26:01.873
I know that smell.

01:26:05.877 --> 01:26:08.213
May I ask you what happened?

01:26:12.450 --> 01:26:15.053
Seven years old.

01:26:15.119 --> 01:26:18.723
I was sleeping
in my foster mom's basement

01:26:18.790 --> 01:26:20.758
when her heater blowed up.

01:26:20.825 --> 01:26:22.961
Catched my PJ's on fire.

01:26:24.196 --> 01:26:26.198
I was screaming
for two minutes straight

01:26:26.265 --> 01:26:27.465
before they found me.

01:26:31.502 --> 01:26:36.908
Everybody knowed that I got
a fear of being burned.

01:26:36.975 --> 01:26:39.911
They knowed
what it would do to my head

01:26:39.978 --> 01:26:42.513
to be in a place like that.

01:26:44.082 --> 01:26:47.618
I couldn't stop shaking
all night.

01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:51.990
Curled up on the floor
like a baby.

01:26:52.056 --> 01:26:55.059
Trying to breathe,
but every breath you take just...

01:26:56.694 --> 01:26:59.731
You get another taste
of the man they killed.

01:27:03.034 --> 01:27:06.170
You can't go through
something like that

01:27:06.238 --> 01:27:07.939
and come out the same.

01:27:13.212 --> 01:27:14.512
I know.

01:27:19.884 --> 01:27:21.387
I called that sheriff
the next morning.

01:27:21.453 --> 01:27:23.188
I told him...

01:27:23.255 --> 01:27:27.125
I would say whatever he wanted
to get me out.

01:27:28.427 --> 01:27:30.762
And he took my statement,

01:27:30.828 --> 01:27:32.997
moved me to county
the next day.

01:27:37.869 --> 01:27:39.971
Mr. Myers, we're going
to court very soon

01:27:40.038 --> 01:27:43.509
to try to get Johnny D.
the retrial he deserves.

01:27:43.574 --> 01:27:45.910
And I'd like you
to take the stand.

01:27:48.579 --> 01:27:49.881
No.

01:27:50.782 --> 01:27:52.717
No, sir. No, sir.

01:27:52.784 --> 01:27:55.053
They are using you.

01:27:55.119 --> 01:27:56.854
They're using you
to condemn a man

01:27:56.921 --> 01:27:59.624
that you have much more
in common with than you think.

01:28:00.558 --> 01:28:01.659
And if there's any part of you

01:28:01.726 --> 01:28:02.994
that wants
to make things right,

01:28:03.061 --> 01:28:05.230
this is the last chance
you're gonna get.

01:28:14.540 --> 01:28:16.241
The tension is high
this morning

01:28:16.308 --> 01:28:18.609
here at the Baldwin
County Courthouse

01:28:18.676 --> 01:28:20.078
<i>where a hearing
is being held</i>

01:28:20.144 --> 01:28:21.879
<i>to see if the man convicted</i>

01:28:21.946 --> 01:28:24.949
<i>of killing Ronda Morrison
deserves a new trial.</i>

01:28:25.016 --> 01:28:27.419
<i>Miss Morrison
was only 18 years old</i>

01:28:27.486 --> 01:28:29.954
<i>when she was murdered
at Jackson Cleaners</i>

01:28:30.021 --> 01:28:31.756
<i>in Monroeville, Alabama.</i>

01:28:31.823 --> 01:28:34.326
<i>Many have taken
the two-hour drive here</i>

01:28:34.393 --> 01:28:36.961
<i>from Monroeville
to show their support.</i>

01:28:37.028 --> 01:28:39.298
<i>Extra security precautions
were implemented</i>

01:28:39.364 --> 01:28:42.633
<i>due to the highly emotional
nature of this case.</i>

01:28:46.104 --> 01:28:48.773
<i>Ronda Morrison's parents said
they have no doubt</i>

01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:50.975
<i>Mr. McMillian
is the man responsible</i>

01:28:51.042 --> 01:28:52.877
<i>for the murder
of their daughter.</i>

01:28:52.944 --> 01:28:54.712
<i>But members
of McMillian's family</i>

01:28:54.779 --> 01:28:56.781
<i>claim they have the wrong man.</i>

01:28:56.848 --> 01:28:58.283
<i>Much of today's hearing</i>

01:28:58.350 --> 01:29:00.718
<i>is hinging on the testimony
of Ralph Myers,</i>

01:29:00.785 --> 01:29:03.121
<i>a convicted felon,
who was the key witness</i>

01:29:03.188 --> 01:29:05.923
<i>against McMillian
in the original trial.</i>

01:29:34.752 --> 01:29:37.623
What we'll be talking
about today is obviously

01:29:37.688 --> 01:29:39.358
an emotional issue.

01:29:39.424 --> 01:29:42.194
And if any of y'all
don't think you can maintain

01:29:42.261 --> 01:29:44.996
a reasonable degree
of decorum,

01:29:45.062 --> 01:29:47.965
then I would ask you
to leave now.

01:29:51.969 --> 01:29:55.773
All right, if we're ready,
then, we will proceed.

01:29:57.509 --> 01:29:59.578
Mr. Stevenson.

01:29:59.645 --> 01:30:01.180
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:30:12.156 --> 01:30:14.091
The State's case
against Walter McMillian

01:30:14.158 --> 01:30:16.994
turned entirely on the
testimony of Ralph Myers.

01:30:17.061 --> 01:30:18.263
There was no other evidence

01:30:18.330 --> 01:30:19.997
to establish
Mr. McMillian's guilt.

01:30:20.064 --> 01:30:22.833
No physical evidence
linking him to the crime.

01:30:22.900 --> 01:30:24.636
No motive. No witnesses.

01:30:24.702 --> 01:30:26.971
Only the word of one man.

01:30:28.873 --> 01:30:31.709
We call Ralph Myers
to the stand.

01:30:56.100 --> 01:30:57.336
Sir, please stand

01:30:57.402 --> 01:30:58.403
and place your right hand
on the Bible.

01:31:02.006 --> 01:31:03.475
You swear to tell truth,
the whole truth,

01:31:03.542 --> 01:31:05.943
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

01:31:07.812 --> 01:31:09.080
Mr. Myers?

01:31:09.747 --> 01:31:12.317
Oh, yes. Sorry.

01:31:12.384 --> 01:31:14.586
The guards got me up
about 2:00 in the morning

01:31:14.653 --> 01:31:16.053
to get me out here.

01:31:28.367 --> 01:31:30.801
Mr. Myers, did you testify
against Walter McMillian

01:31:30.868 --> 01:31:32.537
in August of 1988?

01:31:33.605 --> 01:31:35.307
Is that when it was?

01:31:36.642 --> 01:31:38.776
According to the record, yes.

01:31:39.711 --> 01:31:42.481
Okay, then, sure.
If you say so.

01:31:45.584 --> 01:31:48.553
And what did you say to
the jury when you testified?

01:31:52.923 --> 01:31:56.728
I don't think
I can fully remember, sir,

01:31:56.794 --> 01:31:59.498
to be honest with you. Sorry.

01:32:00.865 --> 01:32:02.334
No, that's quite all right.

01:32:02.401 --> 01:32:04.835
I have a transcript
of your testimony right here.

01:32:17.215 --> 01:32:19.251
At the trial,
do you remember testifying

01:32:19.318 --> 01:32:20.985
that you were
unwillingly made part of

01:32:21.052 --> 01:32:24.222
a capital murder and robbery
on November 1st, 1986,

01:32:24.289 --> 01:32:26.525
when Walter McMillian
saw you at a car wash

01:32:26.591 --> 01:32:29.227
and asked you to drive his
truck because his arm hurt?

01:32:30.895 --> 01:32:32.764
Yes, sir, I guess so.

01:32:32.830 --> 01:32:35.467
Do you remember saying
that you drove Mr. McMillian

01:32:35.534 --> 01:32:37.134
to Jackson Cleaners,

01:32:37.202 --> 01:32:39.036
subsequently went
into the building,

01:32:39.103 --> 01:32:41.138
and saw Mr. McMillian
with a gun,

01:32:41.206 --> 01:32:43.608
standing over the body
of Ronda Morrison?

01:32:45.876 --> 01:32:48.547
Yes, sir.

01:32:48.613 --> 01:32:51.048
Mr. Myers, was the testimony
that you gave

01:32:51.115 --> 01:32:53.552
at Walter McMillian's
trial true?

01:33:03.729 --> 01:33:04.796
I don't know.

01:33:08.533 --> 01:33:09.634
You don't know?

01:33:13.003 --> 01:33:15.106
I don't think I remember.

01:33:37.161 --> 01:33:42.200
Mr. Myers, do you know
who Walter McMillian is?

01:33:43.869 --> 01:33:45.203
Yes, sir.

01:33:46.605 --> 01:33:48.240
Is he in this room?

01:33:49.474 --> 01:33:51.376
Yes, sir.

01:33:54.912 --> 01:33:57.215
Could you point him out
for us?

01:34:20.372 --> 01:34:23.941
I'd like to ask you
that question one more time.

01:34:24.008 --> 01:34:25.444
Was the testimony
that you gave

01:34:25.510 --> 01:34:29.079
at Walter McMillian's
trial true?

01:34:37.923 --> 01:34:39.858
No, sir. Not at all.

01:34:39.925 --> 01:34:42.427
Order, please.

01:34:43.662 --> 01:34:44.930
Did you see
Mr. McMillian on the day

01:34:44.995 --> 01:34:46.832
Ronda Morrison was murdered?

01:34:46.898 --> 01:34:48.266
No, sir.

01:34:48.333 --> 01:34:50.702
Did you drive his truck
to Monroeville that day?

01:34:50.769 --> 01:34:52.304
No. Never did.

01:34:52.370 --> 01:34:53.971
Did you go
into Jackson Cleaners

01:34:54.038 --> 01:34:55.340
and see Mr. McMillian

01:34:55.407 --> 01:34:57.542
standing over the body
of Ronda Morrison?

01:34:58.243 --> 01:34:59.945
Absolutely not.

01:35:04.549 --> 01:35:05.684
Thank you.

01:35:07.051 --> 01:35:08.753
No further questions,
Your Honor.

01:35:14.359 --> 01:35:16.495
<i>Mr. Myers...</i>

01:35:16.561 --> 01:35:20.298
how do we know you ain't upset
with the deal you got,

01:35:20.365 --> 01:35:23.167
and you feel like somehow by

01:35:23.235 --> 01:35:27.405
changing your story,
might help to get you out?

01:35:29.006 --> 01:35:32.577
Because that just
don't make no sense, sir.

01:35:32.644 --> 01:35:36.481
Who do you think is deciding
what happens to me?

01:35:36.548 --> 01:35:38.450
If I live or die?

01:35:38.517 --> 01:35:41.186
It ain't me.
It ain't Johnny D.

01:35:41.253 --> 01:35:43.889
It's all y'all
that's deciding that, so,

01:35:43.955 --> 01:35:45.891
how's my saying
what I'm saying

01:35:45.957 --> 01:35:47.359
gonna help to get me out?

01:35:47.425 --> 01:35:50.395
If anything, it's gonna
help get me to death row.

01:35:51.863 --> 01:35:56.735
But I don't care. Y'all can do
what you want with me.

01:35:56.801 --> 01:35:58.803
'Cause me...

01:35:58.870 --> 01:36:00.639
I can look in your face

01:36:00.705 --> 01:36:04.009
or anybody else's face,
dead eye to eyeball,

01:36:04.074 --> 01:36:07.746
and say that anything
I told about Mr. McMillian...

01:36:09.681 --> 01:36:11.416
was a lie.

01:36:12.450 --> 01:36:14.419
He's here 'cause of me.

01:36:17.589 --> 01:36:19.958
And I sure would appreciate
you sending him home

01:36:20.025 --> 01:36:22.360
to his kids where he belongs.

01:36:27.832 --> 01:36:29.568
We submit a copy
of the official log

01:36:29.634 --> 01:36:31.436
from the police officer
that stopped by the fish fry,

01:36:31.503 --> 01:36:34.606
confirming Walter McMillian
was there with his family.

01:36:34.673 --> 01:36:37.141
Mr. Myers said that
the body was faceup

01:36:37.208 --> 01:36:38.843
near the front counter.

01:36:38.910 --> 01:36:43.481
But I found her facedown
in the back, by the bathroom.

01:36:43.548 --> 01:36:46.184
Submitting exculpatory records
from Ralph Myers' stay

01:36:46.251 --> 01:36:48.219
at the Taylor Hardin
psychiatric hospital.

01:36:48.286 --> 01:36:50.154
Which the State
did not disclose

01:36:50.221 --> 01:36:52.457
to defense counsel.

01:36:52.524 --> 01:36:54.593
<i>Mr. Myers was
my patient at the time</i>

01:36:54.659 --> 01:36:57.295
and he claimed
on numerous occasions

01:36:57.362 --> 01:36:59.898
that he was being threatened
with the electric chair,

01:36:59.965 --> 01:37:01.199
if he didn't say

01:37:01.266 --> 01:37:02.901
what the authorities
wanted to hear.

01:37:02.968 --> 01:37:05.537
The prosecutor
asked me to testify

01:37:05.604 --> 01:37:08.673
that she had been drugged
from the front to the back.

01:37:08.740 --> 01:37:12.410
And I told him,
"I ain't gonna lie in court."

01:37:12.477 --> 01:37:14.446
And then, well,
a few weeks later,

01:37:14.512 --> 01:37:16.881
I got fired
from the department.

01:37:18.883 --> 01:37:20.752
All of the evidence
presented today

01:37:20.819 --> 01:37:23.688
would have been critical
to the outcome of this case.

01:37:23.755 --> 01:37:25.824
And its exclusion
is a clear violation

01:37:25.890 --> 01:37:27.225
of <i>Brady v. Maryland</i>

01:37:27.292 --> 01:37:30.195
and Mr. McMillian's
constitutional rights.

01:37:30.261 --> 01:37:32.731
The truth has not been told
in this case.

01:37:32.797 --> 01:37:36.301
And I understand
a lot of time has gone by,

01:37:36.368 --> 01:37:37.535
but I personally believe

01:37:37.602 --> 01:37:40.305
that it's never too late
for justice.

01:37:40.372 --> 01:37:42.107
We ask the court
to grant our motion

01:37:42.172 --> 01:37:44.676
and order a new trial
for Mr. McMillian.

01:37:46.311 --> 01:37:47.912
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:37:50.281 --> 01:37:52.350
Thank you, Counselors.

01:37:52.417 --> 01:37:53.752
We'll reconvene
at a later date,

01:37:53.818 --> 01:37:56.221
once I've had time
to look through everything.

01:37:57.322 --> 01:37:58.790
All rise.

01:38:04.429 --> 01:38:05.597
Tell you the truth,
I didn't think

01:38:05.664 --> 01:38:07.365
he was gonna
go through with it.

01:38:07.432 --> 01:38:10.268
Honestly, for a second there,
I didn't think so either.

01:38:15.373 --> 01:38:18.243
I can't even tell you
how I feel right now.

01:38:20.979 --> 01:38:22.247
Thank you.

01:38:32.290 --> 01:38:34.659
We got a few minutes
if y'all wanna say hi.

01:38:43.535 --> 01:38:45.470
We leave in five minutes.

01:38:45.537 --> 01:38:47.505
What's up, old man?

01:38:47.572 --> 01:38:49.541
- You did great.
- Thank you.

01:38:49.607 --> 01:38:51.876
Mmm-hmm. Chapman ought to
call you tonight

01:38:51.943 --> 01:38:53.611
and tell you that he's
dropping all them charges.

01:38:53.678 --> 01:38:55.547
Yeah, I wouldn't
hold my breath.

01:39:05.056 --> 01:39:07.459
<i>Upon the reading
of my decision,</i>

01:39:07.525 --> 01:39:10.361
<i>I expect the rules
of decorum in this courtroom</i>

01:39:10.428 --> 01:39:11.563
<i>to be upheld.</i>

01:39:15.734 --> 01:39:18.470
Ralph Myers took the stand
before this court,

01:39:18.536 --> 01:39:20.371
swore to tell the truth,

01:39:20.438 --> 01:39:23.108
and proceeded to recant most,
if not all,

01:39:23.174 --> 01:39:27.412
of the relevant portions
of his testimony at trial.

01:39:27.479 --> 01:39:30.482
Clearly, he has either
perjured himself at trial,

01:39:30.548 --> 01:39:32.550
or in front of this court.

01:39:33.885 --> 01:39:35.420
After careful review,

01:39:35.487 --> 01:39:36.821
it is this court's opinion

01:39:36.888 --> 01:39:40.058
that conclusive evidence
has not been provided

01:39:40.125 --> 01:39:43.895
that Ralph Myers perjured
himself at the original trial,

01:39:43.962 --> 01:39:47.766
and that pressure put on him
since his trial testimony

01:39:47.832 --> 01:39:51.703
could tend to discredit
his recantation.

01:39:51.770 --> 01:39:55.340
Therefore, it is ordered,
adjudged and decreed

01:39:55.406 --> 01:39:57.709
that the trial testimony
of Ralph Myers

01:39:57.776 --> 01:40:01.213
is not found to have been
perjured testimony

01:40:01.279 --> 01:40:02.614
and no new trial
shall be granted...

01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:05.150
- It's not over.
- ...at this time.

01:40:05.217 --> 01:40:06.684
Walter McMillian
shall be returned

01:40:06.751 --> 01:40:08.520
to Holman
Correctional Facility

01:40:08.586 --> 01:40:11.523
where he is to face death
by electrocution.

01:40:26.604 --> 01:40:28.940
You can't do this
to us again, Judge.

01:40:29.007 --> 01:40:30.308
Sit down, young man.

01:40:30.375 --> 01:40:31.409
- John...
- This is my dad, sir.

01:40:31.476 --> 01:40:33.245
John. I want you
to sit down now.

01:40:33.311 --> 01:40:34.746
He ain't do nothing wrong.

01:40:34.813 --> 01:40:36.614
Listen to your father.
Not here.

01:40:36.681 --> 01:40:37.849
He ain't do nothing wrong.

01:40:37.916 --> 01:40:39.484
Sit down right now

01:40:39.551 --> 01:40:41.119
or you'll be arrested
for contempt of court.

01:40:41.187 --> 01:40:42.587
Judge, just give me
one second. Please, Judge.

01:40:42.654 --> 01:40:44.689
- Hold on one second.
- Sit down, John.

01:40:44.756 --> 01:40:46.624
I won't
say it again. Sit down!

01:40:46.691 --> 01:40:49.027
Not if you gonna kill my dad
for no reason.

01:40:49.093 --> 01:40:52.198
Not if you gonna kill my dad
for no reason!

01:40:52.264 --> 01:40:53.464
He ain't do nothing wrong!

01:40:53.531 --> 01:40:54.566
Not in here.
Not like this.

01:40:54.632 --> 01:40:57.269
You killing my family, sir.

01:40:57.335 --> 01:41:00.038
You killing my family, sir.
You!

01:41:05.510 --> 01:41:07.378
John!

01:41:07.445 --> 01:41:08.947
Judge! Judge!
He's not resisting.

01:41:09.013 --> 01:41:10.682
- John!
- He ain't do nothing.

01:41:10.748 --> 01:41:12.050
Stop resisting.

01:41:31.970 --> 01:41:34.505
You hear me?
Don't you let them get you.

01:41:38.210 --> 01:41:40.246
It's gonna be all right.

01:41:40.312 --> 01:41:41.846
Come on.
Let's get you home.

01:42:01.966 --> 01:42:04.602
Come on, man,
don't make this hard.

01:42:10.842 --> 01:42:12.043
Come on.

01:42:12.110 --> 01:42:14.946
No. Don't do this, McMillian.
Come on. Go in.

01:42:16.315 --> 01:42:18.583
Johnny D., no! No!

01:42:21.719 --> 01:42:24.122
Johnny D., no!

01:42:24.189 --> 01:42:26.658
Johnny...

01:42:29.894 --> 01:42:32.231
Relax. Relax. Relax.

01:42:33.598 --> 01:42:34.933
Give me your arm.
Give me...

01:42:34.999 --> 01:42:36.668
Get him cuffed!
Get him cuffed.

01:42:37.435 --> 01:42:38.436
Relax.

01:42:47.612 --> 01:42:48.780
Good job.

01:44:53.905 --> 01:44:55.307
Nobody wants to remember

01:44:55.374 --> 01:44:58.109
that this is where
thousands of enslaved people

01:44:58.177 --> 01:45:02.247
were shipped in and paraded
up the street to be sold.

01:45:05.284 --> 01:45:06.818
Just ten miles from here,

01:45:06.884 --> 01:45:08.886
black people were pulled
from their homes and lynched.

01:45:10.222 --> 01:45:11.856
Nobody talks about it.

01:45:15.993 --> 01:45:17.795
And now this black boy
from Delaware

01:45:17.862 --> 01:45:19.465
walks into their courtrooms

01:45:19.531 --> 01:45:20.932
and expects them to admit

01:45:20.998 --> 01:45:24.336
they convicted
an innocent black man.

01:45:27.004 --> 01:45:28.507
I promised
that whole community

01:45:28.574 --> 01:45:30.375
I was gonna bring him home.

01:45:34.712 --> 01:45:36.981
Then I just
made things worse.

01:45:45.823 --> 01:45:47.792
I've heard
a lot of lawyers say

01:45:47.859 --> 01:45:50.761
it's not a good idea
to get close to your clients.

01:45:51.762 --> 01:45:53.965
Distance is healthy.

01:45:57.168 --> 01:46:00.638
But working with you showed me
that that's bullshit.

01:46:02.441 --> 01:46:06.345
You choose to get close
to every one of them.

01:46:06.411 --> 01:46:10.815
And you love them
like they are your family.

01:46:10.882 --> 01:46:13.918
And when your family
is hurting, you're hurting.

01:46:19.525 --> 01:46:22.026
There is no way
that I could fully understand

01:46:22.093 --> 01:46:24.196
what it is
that you're going through.

01:46:28.032 --> 01:46:29.734
But I am pretty sure that

01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:32.703
you mean a lot more to this
community than you think.

01:47:38.537 --> 01:47:40.472
Walter, I'm so sorry.

01:47:47.346 --> 01:47:50.482
Day I got arrested,
I thought I was gonna be okay.

01:47:52.417 --> 01:47:54.386
'Cause I got the truth.

01:47:58.457 --> 01:48:00.626
Soon as they talk to
everybody that was with me,

01:48:00.692 --> 01:48:02.860
they gonna have
to let me go.

01:48:07.898 --> 01:48:11.002
Then the police
keep calling you a killer.

01:48:13.238 --> 01:48:17.509
Some white dude say
he saw you do it.

01:48:20.945 --> 01:48:23.415
News people saying
you did it.

01:48:25.016 --> 01:48:28.553
Judge and jury
saying you did it.

01:48:31.889 --> 01:48:33.824
Now you on the row...

01:48:37.663 --> 01:48:40.164
two, three, four years.

01:48:40.232 --> 01:48:41.700
Your friends and your kids

01:48:41.767 --> 01:48:44.001
ain't calling you
like they used to.

01:48:46.204 --> 01:48:48.674
After a while,
you start wondering

01:48:48.740 --> 01:48:50.575
what they think about you.

01:48:52.043 --> 01:48:55.247
You start wondering
what you think about you.

01:49:00.985 --> 01:49:03.588
The truth
ain't so clear no more.

01:49:08.627 --> 01:49:11.128
But these last few days,

01:49:11.196 --> 01:49:14.333
I can't stop thinking
about Myers up there.

01:49:14.399 --> 01:49:17.235
Telling everybody
how it went down.

01:49:21.239 --> 01:49:23.107
That's the first time
I feel like myself

01:49:23.174 --> 01:49:25.177
since I've been locked up.

01:49:27.579 --> 01:49:30.315
The first time
I remember who I is.

01:49:39.291 --> 01:49:42.093
These fools gonna do
what they gonna do.

01:49:45.263 --> 01:49:48.200
But if they take me
to that chair tonight...

01:49:51.269 --> 01:49:53.438
I'm going out smiling.

01:49:56.241 --> 01:49:58.610
'Cause I got my truth back.

01:50:03.147 --> 01:50:05.149
You gave that to me.

01:50:07.952 --> 01:50:10.087
To me and my family.

01:50:12.591 --> 01:50:15.394
And ain't nobody
gonna take that from us.

01:50:25.035 --> 01:50:27.071
You ain't quitting, is you?

01:50:31.243 --> 01:50:32.511
No, sir.

01:50:39.384 --> 01:50:42.487
Then there ain't no reason
for you to say you're sorry.

01:50:49.594 --> 01:50:51.530
<i>I know
how disappointing</i>

01:50:51.596 --> 01:50:53.265
the last hearing was,

01:50:53.331 --> 01:50:57.001
but that's not where
this is gonna end.

01:50:57.067 --> 01:50:58.670
We're preparing a motion
to submit our evidence

01:50:58.737 --> 01:51:01.506
to the State Supreme Court
in Montgomery.

01:51:01.573 --> 01:51:03.608
They have the power
to reverse the last decision

01:51:03.675 --> 01:51:06.611
and force the circuit court
to give us a new trial.

01:51:07.679 --> 01:51:09.314
You think they'll do that?

01:51:09.381 --> 01:51:11.483
Nothing's guaranteed.

01:51:11.550 --> 01:51:13.351
But I can't see
how an outside court

01:51:13.418 --> 01:51:15.687
can ignore the evidence
that we have.

01:51:17.121 --> 01:51:18.623
And then what?

01:51:19.691 --> 01:51:20.991
Even if he do get out,

01:51:21.058 --> 01:51:23.961
everybody but us
still gonna think he guilty.

01:51:24.028 --> 01:51:25.029
If they can't kill him
in there,

01:51:25.095 --> 01:51:27.031
they can still do it out here.

01:51:28.032 --> 01:51:30.235
We've been worried
about that, too.

01:51:30.302 --> 01:51:33.205
And we're working on something
to help get the truth out.

01:51:39.845 --> 01:51:41.045
We're rolling.

01:51:41.111 --> 01:51:42.614
Whenever you're ready,
Mr. Bradley.

01:51:42.681 --> 01:51:45.317
Okay, Bryan,
you ready?

01:51:45.784 --> 01:51:47.352
I am.

01:51:51.189 --> 01:51:53.191
<i>His name is Walter McMillian,</i>

01:51:53.258 --> 01:51:55.059
<i>known to his friends
as Johnny D.,</i>

01:51:55.125 --> 01:51:57.929
<i>and he's been on death row
in Alabama's Holman prison</i>

01:51:57.995 --> 01:52:00.164
<i>for almost six years.</i>

01:52:00.232 --> 01:52:02.734
<i>A jury was convinced
they got the right man.</i>

01:52:02.801 --> 01:52:06.404
<i>But you may not be
after you watch this story.</i>

01:52:06.471 --> 01:52:07.772
<i>The clerk who was murdered...</i>

01:52:07.839 --> 01:52:10.040
Hey, hey, turn that up!
I can't hear it.

01:52:10.107 --> 01:52:14.044
<i>Johnny D. says they
want to execute the wrong man.</i>

01:52:14.111 --> 01:52:16.013
<i>You didn't kill
Ronda Morrison?</i>

01:52:16.080 --> 01:52:17.916
<i>No, sir. I never seen Ronda
Morrison a day in my life.</i>

01:52:17.983 --> 01:52:19.951
<i>God knows I ain't.</i>

01:52:20.017 --> 01:52:22.187
<i>Did you ever go into
Monroeville on the day of the murder?</i>

01:52:22.254 --> 01:52:23.788
<i>No, sir.</i>

01:52:23.855 --> 01:52:25.257
<i>You never went in...</i>

01:52:25.323 --> 01:52:26.791
<i>Never went
to Monroeville, period.</i>

01:52:26.858 --> 01:52:28.827
<i>I told them
I had seen a young girl</i>

01:52:28.894 --> 01:52:31.161
<i>laying on the floor
with her mouth open.</i>

01:52:31.229 --> 01:52:33.198
<i>Johnny D. standing over her.</i>

01:52:33.265 --> 01:52:34.833
<i>Was it true?</i>

01:52:34.900 --> 01:52:38.537
<i>No, sir. Not at all.
Nowhere near true.</i>

01:52:38.603 --> 01:52:41.239
<i>If an execution date
is set for McMillian,</i>

01:52:41.306 --> 01:52:42.908
<i>and that day comes,</i>

01:52:42.974 --> 01:52:46.076
<i>and it's time for him to go
to the electric chair,</i>

01:52:46.143 --> 01:52:47.579
<i>will you be comfortable?</i>

01:52:47.646 --> 01:52:49.548
<i>Yes.</i>

01:52:49.614 --> 01:52:51.616
<i>I'd be comfortable with it.</i>

01:52:51.683 --> 01:52:54.452
<i>Do you think
it's fair, just? He had his...</i>

01:52:54.519 --> 01:52:56.187
<i>He had his day in court.</i>

01:52:56.254 --> 01:52:58.390
<i>He, uh, was tried by a jury.</i>

01:52:58.456 --> 01:53:01.125
<i>They heard his testimony
and they believed it.</i>

01:53:01.192 --> 01:53:02.794
<i>Chapman says he's going</i>

01:53:02.861 --> 01:53:04.596
<i>to indict Myers for perjury.</i>

01:53:04.663 --> 01:53:06.932
<i>Not for what he said
at the trial,</i>

01:53:06.998 --> 01:53:09.000
<i>but for what he's saying now.</i>

01:53:09.066 --> 01:53:10.869
<i>Next, we'll be
presenting our evidence</i>

01:53:10.936 --> 01:53:12.537
<i>to the Alabama Supreme Court,</i>

01:53:12.604 --> 01:53:15.373
<i>hoping they'll see
what we think is very clear...</i>

01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:17.509
<i>that Walter McMillian
is innocent.</i>

01:53:17.576 --> 01:53:20.011
<i>McMillian's fate
is now in the hands</i>

01:53:20.077 --> 01:53:21.580
<i>of the Alabama Supreme Court,</i>

01:53:21.646 --> 01:53:24.114
<i>which is expected
to decide soon</i>

01:53:24.182 --> 01:53:26.384
<i>if he's entitled
to a new trial.</i>

01:53:31.890 --> 01:53:33.792
EJI, this is Brenda.

01:53:37.329 --> 01:53:39.497
Okay. I'll let him know.
Thank you.

01:53:42.634 --> 01:53:44.869
The supreme court ruling
in the McMillian case

01:53:44.936 --> 01:53:46.471
is ready to be picked up.

01:53:51.743 --> 01:53:53.110
I'll be back.

01:54:14.332 --> 01:54:15.600
<i>A wave of shock</i>

01:54:15.667 --> 01:54:17.035
<i>rolled through
Monroe County today,</i>

01:54:17.102 --> 01:54:18.703
when the Alabama
Supreme Court overturned

01:54:18.770 --> 01:54:20.372
the circuit court's
previous decision,

01:54:20.438 --> 01:54:22.540
and granted a new trial
to convicted killer

01:54:22.607 --> 01:54:24.843
Walter "Johnny D." McMillian.

01:54:24.909 --> 01:54:27.045
This was the first time
a court outside the county

01:54:27.112 --> 01:54:28.647
was shown
the overwhelming evidence

01:54:28.713 --> 01:54:30.515
proving Mr. McMillian's
innocence.

01:54:30.582 --> 01:54:32.417
Though the court
granted him a new trial,

01:54:32.484 --> 01:54:34.319
we believe he deserves
to be released immediately.

01:54:34.386 --> 01:54:36.955
And that's exactly what we'll
be arguing at the next hearing.

01:54:37.022 --> 01:54:38.590
Mr. Chapman, how do you feel
about today's decision?

01:54:38.657 --> 01:54:41.292
I have no comment
at this time. Thank you.

01:54:48.633 --> 01:54:50.969
I'm looking
for Attorney Bryan Stevenson.

01:54:52.604 --> 01:54:54.606
- Mr. Stevenson?
- How can I help you?

01:54:54.673 --> 01:54:57.509
Yes, sir, I've been ordered
to serve you this pleading.

01:54:58.309 --> 01:54:59.744
Thank you.

01:55:15.026 --> 01:55:17.529
Tommy Chapman is asking the
court to stay the proceedings,

01:55:17.595 --> 01:55:20.699
so he can open up
a new investigation.

01:55:20.765 --> 01:55:23.702
He's trying to buy time
to rebuild his case.

01:55:23.768 --> 01:55:26.738
That son of a bitch.

01:55:33.344 --> 01:55:34.779
- Bryan?
- You're asking the court

01:55:34.846 --> 01:55:37.582
to keep a man on death row
you know is innocent.

01:55:39.284 --> 01:55:40.552
Excuse me, Counselor?

01:55:40.618 --> 01:55:42.188
I don't know
what you mean.

01:55:42.253 --> 01:55:44.255
The supreme court supports
all the evidence we presented.

01:55:44.322 --> 01:55:46.257
Every one of
your witnesses recanted.

01:55:46.324 --> 01:55:47.859
You got nothing left.

01:55:47.926 --> 01:55:49.561
Well, hang on,
my investigation's still in process.

01:55:49.627 --> 01:55:51.763
And we both know you're not
gonna find anything.

01:55:54.733 --> 01:55:57.302
You have any idea the bullshit

01:55:57.368 --> 01:55:58.603
that I've had to put up with

01:55:58.670 --> 01:56:01.139
since your <i>60 Minutes</i>
story aired?

01:56:01.207 --> 01:56:02.540
I got the governor on my ass,

01:56:02.607 --> 01:56:05.477
got the NAACP
calling me a racist.

01:56:05.543 --> 01:56:07.779
I got Ronda's family
checking in every five minutes.

01:56:07.846 --> 01:56:09.514
You can't keep
an innocent man in prison

01:56:09.581 --> 01:56:10.982
while you try to salvage
your reputation.

01:56:11.049 --> 01:56:13.818
This ain't got nothing to do
with my reputation.

01:56:14.853 --> 01:56:16.654
This is about the people
of this county

01:56:16.721 --> 01:56:19.858
who have hired me
to keep 'em safe.

01:56:19.924 --> 01:56:22.694
And what people are you
talking about right now?

01:56:22.761 --> 01:56:24.462
The ones
from this neighborhood?

01:56:24.529 --> 01:56:26.030
Or the ones
from the black community

01:56:26.097 --> 01:56:27.532
you took Johnny D. from?

01:56:27.599 --> 01:56:30.034
You think they feel safe?

01:56:32.871 --> 01:56:35.473
Your job isn't to defend
a conviction, Tommy.

01:56:35.540 --> 01:56:37.909
It's to achieve justice.

01:56:37.976 --> 01:56:39.844
And as long
as you keep fighting this,

01:56:39.911 --> 01:56:40.912
someone from your county

01:56:40.979 --> 01:56:44.549
has literally gotten away
with murder.

01:56:44.616 --> 01:56:46.484
You wanna come all the way
to my house at dinner time

01:56:46.551 --> 01:56:48.254
just to tell me
how to do my job?

01:56:48.319 --> 01:56:49.487
No.

01:56:49.554 --> 01:56:50.755
No, I'm here
because I think you know

01:56:50.822 --> 01:56:53.491
the difference
between right and wrong.

01:56:53.558 --> 01:56:56.327
And you know Johnny D.
didn't kill that girl.

01:56:57.796 --> 01:57:00.431
I'm filing a motion
to dismiss all charges.

01:57:00.498 --> 01:57:02.834
And I think that
you should join it.

01:57:14.012 --> 01:57:16.681
Next time you wanna
stop by my house,

01:57:18.616 --> 01:57:20.552
appreciate you
calling me first.

01:57:20.618 --> 01:57:23.054
Now, you get the hell
off my property, Bryan.

01:57:43.408 --> 01:57:45.109
There's Bryan.

01:57:45.177 --> 01:57:47.078
- What's going on?
- They won't let us in.

01:57:47.145 --> 01:57:51.049
That boy is making us wait
out here for over an hour.

01:57:51.115 --> 01:57:52.383
Excuse me.

01:57:52.450 --> 01:57:53.685
What are you doing?

01:57:53.751 --> 01:57:55.520
Just following orders.

01:57:55.587 --> 01:57:56.888
This is a public hearing.

01:57:56.955 --> 01:57:58.923
These people need
to be let in now.

01:58:01.459 --> 01:58:02.660
Um...

01:58:05.663 --> 01:58:07.498
Y'all can go in now.

01:58:07.565 --> 01:58:09.133
Now that
there's no seats left.

01:58:09.201 --> 01:58:11.069
It's okay.

01:58:11.135 --> 01:58:12.570
We'll find room.

01:58:12.637 --> 01:58:13.738
- Go on in.
- Y'all come on.

01:58:13.805 --> 01:58:15.341
- Excuse us.
- Yeah.

01:58:15.406 --> 01:58:17.375
Come on, y'all.

01:58:17.442 --> 01:58:19.811
Right this way. Come on.

01:58:19.878 --> 01:58:21.079
Okay.

01:58:24.415 --> 01:58:25.483
Good to see you, sugar.

01:58:25.550 --> 01:58:27.719
Okay. Thank you.
Yes, ma'am.

01:58:29.387 --> 01:58:30.922
All rise.

01:58:33.391 --> 01:58:35.593
The 28th Judicial
Circuit Court of Alabama

01:58:35.660 --> 01:58:36.995
is now is session.

01:58:37.061 --> 01:58:40.131
The Honorable Judge
Pamela Baschab presiding.

01:58:40.199 --> 01:58:41.532
Please be seated.

01:58:44.602 --> 01:58:46.238
We've got a full house,

01:58:46.305 --> 01:58:49.308
so let's try to move through
this in a timely manner.

01:58:49.375 --> 01:58:51.643
We're here
because Mr. Stevenson

01:58:51.709 --> 01:58:54.612
has filed a motion
to dismiss all charges

01:58:54.679 --> 01:58:57.115
against Mr. McMillian
in this case.

01:58:57.182 --> 01:58:58.983
Now, Mr. Stevenson,
since it's your motion,

01:58:59.050 --> 01:59:00.852
I'd like for you
to speak to it first

01:59:00.919 --> 01:59:02.954
and then we'll hear
from the State.

01:59:15.600 --> 01:59:16.901
It's easy to see this case

01:59:16.968 --> 01:59:20.406
as one man trying to prove
his innocence.

01:59:20.471 --> 01:59:23.074
But when you take a black man
and you put him on death row

01:59:23.141 --> 01:59:25.677
a year before his trial...

01:59:25.743 --> 01:59:29.914
and exclude black people
from serving on his jury...

01:59:29.981 --> 01:59:31.383
When you base
your conviction

01:59:31.449 --> 01:59:33.952
on a coerced testimony
of a white felon,

01:59:34.018 --> 01:59:36.322
and ignore the testimony
of two dozen

01:59:36.388 --> 01:59:39.757
law-abiding
black witnesses...

01:59:39.824 --> 01:59:41.960
When any evidence proving
his innocence is suppressed

01:59:42.026 --> 01:59:46.130
and anyone who tries to tell
the truth is threatened,

01:59:46.198 --> 01:59:48.132
this case becomes
more than the trial

01:59:48.200 --> 01:59:49.934
of just a single defendant.

01:59:50.535 --> 01:59:52.136
It becomes a test

01:59:52.204 --> 01:59:56.074
of whether we're going to be
governed by fear and by anger,

01:59:56.140 --> 01:59:58.076
or by the rule of law.

02:00:04.316 --> 02:00:06.251
If the people standing
at the back of this courtroom

02:00:06.318 --> 02:00:09.554
are all presumed guilty
when accused...

02:00:11.256 --> 02:00:13.591
If they have to leave here
and live in fear

02:00:13.658 --> 02:00:16.594
of when this very thing
will happen to them...

02:00:18.230 --> 02:00:19.897
If we're just gonna accept
the system

02:00:19.964 --> 02:00:22.867
that treats you better
if you're rich and guilty

02:00:22.934 --> 02:00:24.370
than if you're poor
and innocent,

02:00:24.436 --> 02:00:28.240
then we can't claim
to be just.

02:00:28.307 --> 02:00:31.642
If we say we're committed
to equal justice under law

02:00:31.709 --> 02:00:33.778
to protecting the rights
of every citizen,

02:00:33.845 --> 02:00:37.615
regardless of wealth,
race, or status,

02:00:37.682 --> 02:00:38.950
then we have to
end this nightmare

02:00:39.017 --> 02:00:41.886
for Walter McMillian
and his family.

02:00:41.953 --> 02:00:43.554
The charges against him
have been proven

02:00:43.621 --> 02:00:45.056
to be a false construction

02:00:45.123 --> 02:00:48.960
of desperate people
fueled by bigotry and bias,

02:00:49.027 --> 02:00:51.829
who ignored the truth in
exchange for easy solutions,

02:00:51.896 --> 02:00:54.098
and that's not the law.

02:00:55.533 --> 02:00:57.568
That's not justice.

02:01:00.406 --> 02:01:02.173
That's not right.

02:01:04.776 --> 02:01:05.977
I ask that this case

02:01:06.044 --> 02:01:08.679
be dismissed immediately,
Your Honor.

02:01:11.417 --> 02:01:13.117
Thank you.

02:01:25.397 --> 02:01:27.698
Mr. Chapman,
what is the State's position

02:01:27.765 --> 02:01:29.234
on this motion?

02:01:35.873 --> 02:01:39.110
Your Honor,
may I approach the bench?

02:01:39.178 --> 02:01:40.611
Yes.

02:01:44.816 --> 02:01:46.684
Your Honor, um...

02:01:46.751 --> 02:01:48.753
I'm troubled.

02:01:49.654 --> 02:01:51.722
- You're troubled?
- Troubled.

02:01:56.127 --> 02:01:58.397
'Cause I know that the
people in this community

02:01:58.464 --> 02:02:00.031
want to go
to sleep at night

02:02:00.098 --> 02:02:02.733
knowing that if someone has
committed a terrible crime,

02:02:02.800 --> 02:02:05.703
then that someone
is gonna be punished.

02:02:10.275 --> 02:02:12.143
But, um,

02:02:12.211 --> 02:02:13.978
in this case...

02:02:15.913 --> 02:02:17.549
Your Honor, I have, um,

02:02:17.615 --> 02:02:20.319
taken another look
at the evidence...

02:02:20.385 --> 02:02:21.819
and, uh...

02:02:26.191 --> 02:02:27.892
Mr. Chapman, please?

02:02:27.959 --> 02:02:30.862
And the State does not object
to the motion, Your Honor.

02:02:32.531 --> 02:02:33.865
What?

02:02:36.268 --> 02:02:38.337
To be clear,
Mr. Chapman,

02:02:38.403 --> 02:02:42.773
are you joining the motion
to dismiss all charges today?

02:02:44.041 --> 02:02:45.511
Yes, Your Honor, I am.

02:02:47.011 --> 02:02:48.146
Order.

02:02:48.213 --> 02:02:51.216
Please. Order.

02:02:54.386 --> 02:02:55.587
Well...

02:02:55.653 --> 02:02:58.290
y'all have made
my job easy today.

02:02:58.357 --> 02:03:02.026
In the case of
<i>The People v. McMillian,</i>

02:03:02.093 --> 02:03:06.198
the court hereby grants
the defendant's motion.

02:03:06.265 --> 02:03:09.434
All charges against you
are dismissed, Mr. McMillian.

02:03:09.501 --> 02:03:11.936
What does that mean?

02:03:12.003 --> 02:03:13.671
That means you're free.

02:03:13.738 --> 02:03:15.440
- I'm free?
- That means you're free and you get to go home.

02:03:30.589 --> 02:03:31.822
Hey.

02:03:35.561 --> 02:03:36.894
Your family's coming.

02:03:59.884 --> 02:04:02.321
I have my family back.

02:04:50.167 --> 02:04:52.471
We're all with you, brother.

02:05:13.592 --> 02:05:15.394
Yo, Johnny D.!

02:05:44.323 --> 02:05:45.657
<i>I came out
of law school</i>

02:05:45.724 --> 02:05:47.192
<i>with grand ideas in my mind</i>

02:05:47.259 --> 02:05:49.827
<i>about how to change the world.</i>

02:05:52.497 --> 02:05:54.065
<i>But Mr. McMillian
made me realize</i>

02:05:54.131 --> 02:05:55.334
<i>we can't change the world</i>

02:05:55.400 --> 02:05:58.503
<i>with only ideas
in our minds.</i>

02:05:58.570 --> 02:06:01.172
<i>We need conviction
in our hearts.</i>

02:06:02.441 --> 02:06:05.142
<i>This man taught me
how to stay hopeful.</i>

02:06:05.210 --> 02:06:07.512
<i>Because I now know
that hopelessness</i>

02:06:07.579 --> 02:06:09.748
<i>is the enemy of justice.</i>

02:06:11.616 --> 02:06:13.318
<i>Hope allows us
to push forward,</i>

02:06:13.385 --> 02:06:14.985
<i>even when the truth
is distorted</i>

02:06:15.052 --> 02:06:16.588
<i>by the people in power.</i>

02:06:19.324 --> 02:06:21.526
<i>It allows us to stand up</i>

02:06:21.593 --> 02:06:23.428
<i>when they tell us
to sit down.</i>

02:06:23.495 --> 02:06:26.997
<i>And to speak
when they say, "Be quiet."</i>

02:06:31.336 --> 02:06:33.538
Through this work,
I've learned that each of us

02:06:33.605 --> 02:06:36.006
is more than the worst
thing that we've ever done.

02:06:37.676 --> 02:06:41.313
That the opposite of poverty
isn't wealth.

02:06:41.380 --> 02:06:44.649
The opposite of poverty
is justice.

02:06:46.184 --> 02:06:48.487
That the character
of our nation isn't reflected

02:06:48.553 --> 02:06:52.190
in how we treat the rich
and the privileged,

02:06:52.257 --> 02:06:57.362
but how we treat the poor,
the disfavored and condemned.

02:07:01.333 --> 02:07:04.969
Our system has taken more
away from this innocent man

02:07:05.035 --> 02:07:07.439
than it has the power
to give back.

02:07:10.141 --> 02:07:13.911
But I believe if each of us
can follow his lead,

02:07:13.978 --> 02:07:16.981
we can change this world
for the better.

02:07:20.385 --> 02:07:23.355
If we can look
at ourselves closely,

02:07:23.422 --> 02:07:25.156
and honestly,

02:07:25.223 --> 02:07:29.093
I believe we will see
that we all need justice.

02:07:30.127 --> 02:07:32.864
We all need mercy.

02:07:32.930 --> 02:07:34.433
And perhaps,

02:07:34.499 --> 02:07:38.537
we all need some measure
of unmerited grace.

02:07:41.071 --> 02:07:42.973
Thank you.

02:07:45.677 --> 02:07:48.180
I taught you all that?

02:07:50.615 --> 02:07:53.618
Yeah, you taught me
some of that.

02:07:53.685 --> 02:07:55.019
I'm pretty good, ain't I?

02:07:57.823 --> 02:07:59.391
Great job.

02:09:50.067 --> 02:09:51.903
Hi!

02:09:51.970 --> 02:09:55.640
Oh, Lord, thank you, Jesus.

02:09:55.707 --> 02:09:58.710
Thank you, Lord.

02:09:58.777 --> 02:10:02.547
Oh, thank you, Jesus.
