WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:05.106
Previously on Salvation...
I'm seeing someone.
Harris Edwards.

00:05.139 --> 00:06.274
He's got a son your age.

00:06.307 --> 00:09.177
DANIEL: Jillian.
JILLIAN:
I quit my job and my boyfriend.

00:09.210 --> 00:10.611
Laura and I are engaged.

00:10.644 --> 00:13.114
AMANDA: People have died.
I think it has something

00:13.147 --> 00:15.183
to do with this-- Project Atlas.

00:15.216 --> 00:18.352
You need to dig deeper, find
out where she got that photo.

00:18.386 --> 00:20.054
My friend Katya, the
Russian ambassador--

00:20.088 --> 00:22.423
she said her country
stole our EmDrive out of

00:22.456 --> 00:24.292
retribution for Atlas.

00:24.325 --> 00:25.259
The world's about to catch fire,

00:25.293 --> 00:27.361
and we may be the only ones
who can stop it.

00:27.395 --> 00:29.430
We're going to Russia.
GRACE: Katya, does this photo

00:29.463 --> 00:31.465
have any meaning to you?
The U.S. create some sort of

00:31.499 --> 00:33.201
super weapon to destroy us.

00:33.234 --> 00:35.269
Atlas is a weapons program.

00:35.303 --> 00:37.538
Except the weapon
was an asteroid.

00:37.571 --> 00:40.274
Where did you get these?
Amanda Neel.

00:40.308 --> 00:42.110
HARRIS: Suspend Grace Barrows'
A4 security clearance.

00:42.143 --> 00:43.344
GRACE:
No. Katya, no!

00:43.377 --> 00:46.114
We're gonna be arrested for her
murder if we don't move fast!

00:46.147 --> 00:48.182
Give me your passport.
Without our papers,
we're nobody.

00:48.216 --> 00:49.383
TANZ: That's exactly
who we have to be

00:49.417 --> 00:50.751
if we want
to get out of here alive.

00:50.784 --> 00:52.453
This is not just
some rebellion, Dad.

00:52.486 --> 00:54.722
I'm actually trying
to save the world.

00:54.755 --> 00:57.291
Liam Cole.
Welcome to RE/SYST.

01:05.866 --> 01:07.635
You know everything about us.

01:07.668 --> 01:09.303
I don't even know
your names.

01:09.337 --> 01:12.206
What-what is this?
Is... are you Trinity?

01:12.240 --> 01:15.609
That's Neo over there.
You must be Morpheus.

01:15.643 --> 01:17.311
What you call us
isn't important.

01:17.345 --> 01:20.281
What you know is.
We want answers, Liam.

01:20.314 --> 01:22.150
That makes two of us.
I mean, RE/SYST is all about

01:22.183 --> 01:23.284
free information, right?

01:23.317 --> 01:25.319
So why don't you
throw something my way?

01:25.353 --> 01:28.889
Where'd you get this photo?

01:28.922 --> 01:32.126
And why'd you give it to
Amanda Neel, of all people?

01:32.160 --> 01:34.228
Amanda was the only reporter
looking into what happened

01:34.262 --> 01:36.197
to this man,
Walter Carnahan.

01:36.230 --> 01:38.766
Pentagon sat-tech.

01:38.799 --> 01:40.201
(sighs)

01:40.234 --> 01:41.669
A founding member of RE/SYST.

01:41.702 --> 01:43.504
The founder of RE/SYST...

01:43.537 --> 01:45.306
is a Pentagon employee?

01:45.339 --> 01:46.440
With high-level
clearance?

01:46.474 --> 01:48.209
So much for
national security.

01:48.242 --> 01:49.610
Carnahan was a patriot!

01:49.643 --> 01:52.280
He believed that government
secrets were the enemy

01:52.313 --> 01:54.582
of democracy,
and so do we.

01:54.615 --> 01:57.418
He stumbled across this
government program called Atlas.

01:59.487 --> 02:01.722
The next day, he was murdered.

02:01.755 --> 02:03.257
What, so you think
someone in the government

02:03.291 --> 02:04.292
put a hit on your friend?

02:04.325 --> 02:05.926
And I'm gonna find
out who it is

02:05.959 --> 02:07.461
with your help.

02:07.495 --> 02:09.797
No.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.199
Tanz is the key
to all of this.

02:11.232 --> 02:12.933
We need access!
Look, I am

02:12.966 --> 02:14.302
sorry about your friend,

02:14.335 --> 02:16.337
but I do not know
anything about Atlas,

02:16.370 --> 02:17.671
and neither does Darius.
Really?

02:17.705 --> 02:19.640
Well, how do you explain this?

02:19.673 --> 02:22.176
The FSB issued
this internal memo,

02:22.210 --> 02:24.212
which RE/SYST accessed
through their network.

02:24.245 --> 02:26.914
FSB? What, the Russian
Secret Police?

02:26.947 --> 02:28.516
What does it say?

02:28.549 --> 02:30.618
There's a manhunt
for Darius Tanz

02:30.651 --> 02:33.254
and Grace Barrows
in Moscow.

02:34.855 --> 02:37.325
They're wanted for murder.

02:37.358 --> 02:38.826
What?

02:47.000 --> 02:48.536
(man speaking Russian
over P.A.)

03:01.382 --> 03:03.317
Can I interest
you in souvenir?

03:03.351 --> 03:05.586
We're interested
in a copy of

03:05.619 --> 03:07.921
War and Peace.

03:07.955 --> 03:09.523
Everything you need is in here.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.831
GRACE:
Dmitry.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.269
And Irina Petrovic.

03:21.302 --> 03:23.837
So, we're married?

03:23.871 --> 03:26.874
Hopefully, you two
are good actors, yes? Hmm.

03:32.680 --> 03:35.316
(soft rock music playing)

03:45.893 --> 03:47.628
You're gonna break my stool.

03:47.661 --> 03:50.298
What?
Keep sitting there

03:50.331 --> 03:52.032
with the weight of the world
on your shoulders,

03:52.065 --> 03:54.335
you're gonna break my stool.

03:56.804 --> 04:00.274
Work? A woman?

04:00.308 --> 04:02.676
Little of both.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.278
Hmm.

04:05.646 --> 04:08.916
I have to make a choice
between... one or the other.

04:08.949 --> 04:10.351
Okay, then.

04:10.384 --> 04:12.920
That kind of trouble
deserves a double.

04:15.456 --> 04:17.891
Thanks.

04:17.925 --> 04:20.428
So, uh...

04:20.461 --> 04:22.596
that's it?
No sage advice?

04:22.630 --> 04:24.765
Oh, no. The guy
that offers sage advice

04:24.798 --> 04:27.401
works Tuesday, Thursday,
2:00 to 10:00.

04:27.435 --> 04:29.870
Ah. Just my luck.

04:29.903 --> 04:31.705
All right, well, uh,

04:31.739 --> 04:34.408
my shift's up,
so I'm closing out.

04:34.442 --> 04:36.777
Good luck... with that choice.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.679
Mm-hmm.

04:40.481 --> 04:42.983
Just when
the caterpillar thought

04:43.016 --> 04:47.488
the world was over...
it became a butterfly.

04:48.589 --> 04:50.391
I'm sorry?

04:50.424 --> 04:53.427
You wanted sage advice.

04:53.461 --> 04:55.863
I'll remember that.

05:00.768 --> 05:03.337
(phone chiming)
TESS: Liam,

05:03.371 --> 05:07.074
you have an incoming call from
an unknown Moscow landline.

05:08.609 --> 05:10.344
Put it through, Tess. Hello.

05:10.378 --> 05:12.413
TANZ:
Liam?

05:12.446 --> 05:14.482
What the hell is going on?
You're wanted for murder.

05:14.515 --> 05:16.817
We don't have much time.
The EmDrive?

05:16.850 --> 05:18.386
Done. Fully functional.

05:18.419 --> 05:20.388
Have you told anyone?
LIAM: Not yet.

05:20.421 --> 05:21.655
But you're making progress,
right?

05:21.689 --> 05:22.823
With the Russian government?

05:22.856 --> 05:25.393
Liam, with a little luck,

05:25.426 --> 05:27.761
we just might make it
out of here in one piece,

05:27.795 --> 05:31.465
and if we don't... you're gonna
need to make decisions.

05:31.499 --> 05:32.700
About?

05:32.733 --> 05:35.102
Everything.

05:35.135 --> 05:37.771
The Ark-- we need to

05:37.805 --> 05:40.408
accelerate the 160 selection.

05:40.441 --> 05:42.109
Do you understand?

05:42.142 --> 05:44.445
Yeah.

05:44.478 --> 05:45.946
Yeah, I understand.

05:45.979 --> 05:48.682
Good-bye, Liam.

05:48.716 --> 05:52.019
Yeah. Bye.

05:52.052 --> 05:54.455
(woman speaking Russian
over P.A.)

05:55.656 --> 05:58.459
(speaking Russian)

05:58.492 --> 06:00.861
(speaking Russian)

06:00.894 --> 06:02.996
We're Dmitry
and Irina Petrovic.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.399
I'm a high school physics
teacher, you're an engineer.

06:05.433 --> 06:06.767
We've been married
12 years.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.136
But only four of
them were happy.
(sighs)

06:09.169 --> 06:11.038
What's wrong? Other
than... everything?

06:11.071 --> 06:12.506
We've come all this way

06:12.540 --> 06:15.108
and haven't even had a chance
to make our case.

06:15.142 --> 06:17.044
I mean, if we leave,
what hope's left?

06:17.077 --> 06:18.479
Our only contact
was murdered,

06:18.512 --> 06:19.880
and we're the
prime suspects.

06:19.913 --> 06:22.583
If you have another
idea, I'm all ears.

06:26.053 --> 06:28.388
Hmm? Mmm.

06:31.158 --> 06:34.495
Apologies, Mrs.
Petrovic. FSB agents.

06:34.528 --> 06:36.564
Oh. A little warning
next time.

07:00.588 --> 07:01.989
Darius Tanz.

07:02.022 --> 07:04.091
Darius, they recognize you.

07:04.124 --> 07:06.494
Once that photo hits the
web, we're geotagged.

07:06.527 --> 07:07.861
Everyone will know
where we are.

07:07.895 --> 07:09.930
GRACE:
I don't see how we get out of
here without getting picked up,

07:09.963 --> 07:12.500
no matter how many times
you kiss me.

07:12.533 --> 07:15.168
Grace, I'm afraid the
only way out is...

07:15.202 --> 07:17.204
In.

07:19.640 --> 07:22.009
I'm Darius Tanz.
This is Grace Barrows.

07:24.512 --> 07:25.946
Darius...
(man shouting in Russian)

07:27.114 --> 07:31.018
(man shouting in Russian)

07:31.051 --> 07:33.053
*

07:44.565 --> 07:45.533
HARRIS:
Once I confirmed that

07:45.566 --> 07:46.734
my private access codes

07:46.767 --> 07:48.969
had been compromised,
I had no choice

07:49.002 --> 07:52.640
but to have Grace Barrows'
A4 security clearance revoked.

07:52.673 --> 07:53.607
And you have reason to believe

07:53.641 --> 07:55.576
she and Darius Tanz
are currently in Russia?

07:55.609 --> 07:56.977
Moscow, sir. Yes.

07:57.010 --> 07:59.046
I have it on good authority.
If that's

07:59.079 --> 08:02.182
the case, I'm afraid
they're on their own.

08:02.215 --> 08:03.617
Wait. Sir?

08:03.651 --> 08:06.620
CLAIRE: Harris,
we're at DEFCON 2

08:06.654 --> 08:08.856
for the first time since
the Cuban Missile Crisis.

08:08.889 --> 08:10.724
If I recommend an exfil mission,

08:10.758 --> 08:13.594
and it were to go sideways,
it would mean World War III.
(scoffs)

08:13.627 --> 08:17.064
Look, by no means am I
defending what Grace did,

08:17.097 --> 08:19.667
but since when did we, the
United States government,

08:19.700 --> 08:21.602
adopt such a
laissez-faire attitude

08:21.635 --> 08:23.737
towards getting our people
out of hot spots?

08:23.771 --> 08:28.075
This isn't some third world
sand dune. It's Moscow.

08:28.108 --> 08:29.877
We are talking about
a global superpower

08:29.910 --> 08:33.046
whose missile silos are
currently open, ready for war.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.583
Tanz and Barrows
both knew

08:35.616 --> 08:37.585
that they were putting
themselves in harm's way.

08:37.618 --> 08:40.588
It's not up to us
to save their asses, Harris.

08:40.621 --> 08:43.123
We've got the rest
of the world to think about.

08:48.328 --> 08:50.063
(gasps)

08:50.097 --> 08:51.765
Now you wait.

08:56.303 --> 08:58.071
This is an Airbnb fail.

08:58.105 --> 09:00.107
Oh.

09:00.140 --> 09:03.844
Are those...
bloodstained bullet holes?

09:03.877 --> 09:07.047
Probably.
Maybe we should
ask for an upgrade.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.182
We only drove for
about 40 minutes.

09:09.216 --> 09:12.686
We can't be too far
outside the city.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.354
Remember, everything
we say in here...

09:14.387 --> 09:16.724
(whispers):
They're listening.

09:16.757 --> 09:17.725
(door opens)

09:21.829 --> 09:23.063
Hmm.

09:25.098 --> 09:26.734
Welcome to Moscow.

09:26.767 --> 09:27.835
You're not dead.

09:27.868 --> 09:29.770
Thanks to the skill

09:29.803 --> 09:31.171
of some excellent
Russian doctors.

09:31.204 --> 09:33.674
You son of a bitch!
(grunts)

09:33.707 --> 09:35.075
Darius!

09:35.108 --> 09:37.678
You worthless piece of...
You murdered my friend!

09:37.711 --> 09:39.747
(groans)

09:39.780 --> 09:41.214
Yeah.

09:41.248 --> 09:42.182
Yeah, I'm, uh...

09:42.215 --> 09:46.086
I'm sorry about Lazlo,
but I had no choice.

09:46.119 --> 09:47.921
But we're not here
to rehash the past.

09:47.955 --> 09:49.757
We're here to discuss
the future.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.759
That's why you risked everything
to come here, right?

09:51.792 --> 09:53.794
So we could broker
some sort of peace.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.663
The Russian ambassador was going
to arrange a meeting

09:55.696 --> 09:57.698
with your defense minister
until she was killed.

09:57.731 --> 09:59.933
Unfortunately,
she threatened to go public

09:59.967 --> 10:01.802
when she learned
about the asteroid.

10:01.835 --> 10:05.238
If our governments
have anything in common,

10:05.272 --> 10:09.042
it's a desire to keep this one
particular secret... a secret.

10:09.076 --> 10:11.912
We didn't turn ourselves in

10:11.945 --> 10:14.782
to negotiate with a traitor.

10:14.815 --> 10:18.786
Hmm. I am the reason
that you're still here, Darius.

10:18.819 --> 10:20.721
I am the one that convinced

10:20.754 --> 10:23.423
Defense Minister Toporov
that you're worth

10:23.456 --> 10:24.457
more alive than dead.

10:24.491 --> 10:26.827
Yeah, so we can take
the blame for Katya's murder?

10:26.860 --> 10:29.830
No. So you can end this impasse.

10:29.863 --> 10:31.765
Our EmDrive
is a prototype.

10:31.799 --> 10:34.301
And we've had trouble
constructing a full-scale model

10:34.334 --> 10:35.736
without Tanz's resources.

10:35.769 --> 10:38.706
Bring out the violins.
We have

10:38.739 --> 10:40.774
a gravity tractor,
but we have no way

10:40.808 --> 10:42.676
of getting it to the asteroid
in time.
GRACE: And we have

10:42.710 --> 10:44.411
an EmDrive, but no way
of launching it

10:44.444 --> 10:45.846
without the Russians
shooting it down.

10:45.879 --> 10:47.447
Exactly, so... (chuckles)

10:47.480 --> 10:49.883
If you're willing
to discuss these matters

10:49.917 --> 10:53.721
with the minister of defense,
I can arrange that.

10:53.754 --> 10:55.823
Why should we believe
a word that comes out

10:55.856 --> 10:57.157
of this monster's mouth?!

10:57.190 --> 10:58.959
Well... (chuckles)

10:58.992 --> 11:01.895
frankly,
what choice do you have?

11:10.070 --> 11:12.005
(door closes, locks)

11:12.039 --> 11:14.007
(rock music playing)

11:14.041 --> 11:16.009
Dylan.

11:16.043 --> 11:18.712
I've done a deep dive
on Zoe Barrows.

11:18.746 --> 11:20.180
What's her deal?

11:20.213 --> 11:21.882
The usual social media accounts.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.316
Not a lot of followers.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.753
Photos of her prom
and graduation.

11:25.786 --> 11:27.855
Total bore fest.

11:27.888 --> 11:29.289
She friended me.

11:29.322 --> 11:31.825
Our parents are dating.

11:31.859 --> 11:34.728
So, what are you gonna do?

11:34.762 --> 11:37.330
What friends do.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.402
Mason, right?
Yeah.

11:42.435 --> 11:45.472
Yeah. I'm-I'm Liam Cole,
Darius's right hand.

11:45.505 --> 11:48.441
He asked me to check in on
the status of the 160 project.

11:48.475 --> 11:51.378
The status is that I'm about
to fire that entire staff.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.747
Okay, but you've narrowed down
the candidates, right?

11:53.781 --> 11:54.815
Yes, of course.

11:54.848 --> 11:57.985
We have one
exceptional candidate.

11:58.018 --> 11:59.419
One.

11:59.452 --> 12:01.121
We're still pouring over
the other options,

12:01.154 --> 12:03.824
but Darius put in place
this ridiculous restriction

12:03.857 --> 12:05.926
where we all have to agree
before anyone is selected.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.360
And clearly,

12:07.394 --> 12:09.362
with these troglodytes upstairs,
that's not happening.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.999
Where is Darius, anyway?

12:12.032 --> 12:13.901
He's out of town.
He's on business.

12:13.934 --> 12:15.535
Well, when he returns,

12:15.568 --> 12:17.737
we need to make
some serious changes.

12:20.107 --> 12:21.441
Karissa, Karissa.

12:21.474 --> 12:22.876
I, um, can't believe
I'm asking this,

12:22.910 --> 12:24.511
but is the
helicopter available?

12:24.544 --> 12:26.013
Yes.

12:26.046 --> 12:28.081
Where are you going?

12:28.115 --> 12:29.817
Boston.

12:32.385 --> 12:34.888
DANIEL:
Wow. I don't know how the hell
you pulled all this together.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.523
Do you have a final
head count?

12:36.556 --> 12:39.526
Grand total, 37 people.

12:39.559 --> 12:43.196
I invited someone, as well,
who has RSVP'd.

12:43.230 --> 12:44.865
Oh, yeah?

12:44.898 --> 12:46.967
The MIT guy?
No.

12:48.401 --> 12:50.003
Grandpa.

12:50.037 --> 12:51.905
(scoffs)

12:51.939 --> 12:54.975
Traffic was apocalyptic.

12:55.008 --> 12:57.010
Where's the bar?

12:59.079 --> 13:01.114
(door opens)

13:05.318 --> 13:08.188
Uh, Minister Toporov,
this is Grace Barrows,

13:08.221 --> 13:10.457
she's the press secretary
for the Pentagon.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.893
And the famous Darius Tanz.

13:12.926 --> 13:14.862
Or should I say "infamous"?

13:14.895 --> 13:16.196
Oh, I've been called worse.

13:16.229 --> 13:17.831
A lot worse, actually.

13:17.865 --> 13:18.999
Please.

13:21.034 --> 13:22.970
(Croft clears throat)

13:23.003 --> 13:27.540
Do you know what's the
most valuable commodity

13:27.574 --> 13:30.143
in the world these days?

13:30.177 --> 13:31.511
Not oil.

13:31.544 --> 13:33.847
Not gold,

13:33.881 --> 13:36.516
diamonds.

13:36.549 --> 13:38.952
It's trust.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.123
Can the United States
of America and Russia

13:43.156 --> 13:46.359
ever learn to trust each other
after all that happened?

13:46.393 --> 13:48.061
GRACE: I assure you,
the only enemy

13:48.095 --> 13:51.064
the Russian people have
is the same enemy we have--

13:51.098 --> 13:54.034
that asteroid closing
in on all of us.

14:06.079 --> 14:10.283
If we are to trust you,
Mr. Tanz, Ms. Barrows,

14:10.317 --> 14:11.919
you'll have to prove

14:11.952 --> 14:13.853
you're worthy of that trust.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.316
Sugar?

14:43.350 --> 14:47.020
No, thanks. I take my polonium
straight up, like a man.

14:47.054 --> 14:50.323
(laughs)

14:50.357 --> 14:52.993
Okay.

14:53.026 --> 14:55.128
My proposal is simple.

14:55.162 --> 14:59.232
Drink tea, gain trust.

15:03.971 --> 15:06.006
The only way to know if you can
really trust someone

15:06.039 --> 15:09.009
is to trust them and find out.

15:09.042 --> 15:10.077
Cheers.

15:14.714 --> 15:17.517
I told you they
could be trusted.

15:17.550 --> 15:21.054
Oh, I agree. I agree.

15:21.088 --> 15:24.291
You, on the other hand,
Professor Croft,

15:24.324 --> 15:25.993
not so sure.

15:27.094 --> 15:29.262
(speaking Russian)
Wait, wait.

15:29.296 --> 15:31.064
What are you doing?
Wh-- if it wasn't for me,

15:31.098 --> 15:33.033
you wouldn't have the EmDrive.

15:33.066 --> 15:36.036
I still don't have it,
thanks to your ineptitude.

15:37.170 --> 15:38.505
Yeah.

15:39.606 --> 15:42.009
Darius.

15:43.576 --> 15:46.113
Tell Liam...

15:46.146 --> 15:49.016
I'm sorry.

15:49.049 --> 15:52.285
I'm sorry.

15:58.525 --> 16:01.328
Now, we talk.

16:01.361 --> 16:03.463
About six months ago,

16:03.496 --> 16:06.199
some school children
in Chelyabinsk came across

16:06.233 --> 16:08.201
this unusual rock.

16:14.541 --> 16:16.176
It looks like a piece of my tech

16:16.209 --> 16:18.378
fused to some sort of rock.

16:20.113 --> 16:23.683
TOPOROV: By the time we
pieced together what happened,

16:23.716 --> 16:26.186
we had bigger fish
to fry, as you say.

16:26.219 --> 16:28.021
GRACE:
The threat...

16:28.055 --> 16:29.522
from space.

16:29.556 --> 16:30.990
TOPOROV:
Mm-hmm.

16:32.125 --> 16:33.560
What's happening?

16:33.593 --> 16:35.328
(Grace whimpers)

16:35.362 --> 16:37.264
Darius, something's wrong.

16:37.297 --> 16:40.033
The tea.

16:40.067 --> 16:42.069
(grunts softly)

16:44.271 --> 16:47.074
(groans)

16:47.107 --> 16:49.109
What have you done to us?

16:54.614 --> 16:56.416
(echoing):
Mr. Tanz, Ms. Barrows, relax.

16:56.449 --> 16:59.719
I can assure you the tea
is not gonna kill you,

16:59.752 --> 17:02.155
but it will force you

17:02.189 --> 17:03.756
to tell the truth.

17:03.790 --> 17:06.493
Sodium Pentothal.

17:06.526 --> 17:09.429
Uh, no, no.

17:09.462 --> 17:11.664
It's called SP-117.

17:11.698 --> 17:15.102
Highly reliable,
very few side effects.

17:15.135 --> 17:18.138
You are feeling uninhibited.

17:18.171 --> 17:21.274
Like if you mixed
a muscle relaxant

17:21.308 --> 17:24.811
with, uh,
your favorite cocktail. Hmm?

17:24.844 --> 17:27.280
Sorry I had to take
this precaution,

17:27.314 --> 17:29.349
but the fate of the
world is at stake.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.118
No margin for error.

17:31.151 --> 17:34.821
So, how is it-- Mr. Tanz.

17:36.123 --> 17:37.157
Mr. Tanz.

17:37.190 --> 17:39.626
How is it

17:39.659 --> 17:43.163
that your technology
appeared in this rock?

17:43.196 --> 17:45.398
I had nothing to do
with Project Atlas.

17:45.432 --> 17:48.568
My tech was misappropriated

17:48.601 --> 17:50.837
in order to weaponize
that asteroid

17:50.870 --> 17:54.307
that hit Chelyabinsk.

17:54.341 --> 17:57.410
GRACE: This stuff
makes you feel chatty.

17:57.444 --> 18:00.213
What is it that you want?

18:02.915 --> 18:06.153
A joint effort

18:06.186 --> 18:08.555
with the United States
and Russia.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.423
Darius has a full-scale

18:10.457 --> 18:13.893
EmDrive ready to go, and we're
just gonna get it up there,

18:13.926 --> 18:15.828
and we're gonna
save the world.

18:15.862 --> 18:18.131
And then we can go back
to hating each other

18:18.165 --> 18:20.667
and not doing anything
about it.
(Darius laughs)

18:20.700 --> 18:23.370
TOPOROV: So, you are saying
this is not a ruse

18:23.403 --> 18:25.638
to weaponize the asteroid
and destroy my country.

18:25.672 --> 18:27.307
No, no.

18:27.340 --> 18:29.176
TANZ: Which is why
I'm proposing

18:29.209 --> 18:33.146
Russian oversight
as insurance.

18:33.180 --> 18:35.615
Send your scientists,
politicians-- hell,

18:35.648 --> 18:38.185
send your president
if he'll go.

18:38.218 --> 18:41.654
And we'll launch
this thing together.

18:41.688 --> 18:44.491
If we can put aside our past
and our politics,

18:44.524 --> 18:48.361
we can avert disaster.

18:50.330 --> 18:51.531
(Toporov speaking Russian)

18:54.401 --> 18:59.306
I will present your proposal
to the Federation.

18:59.339 --> 19:01.508
And the president.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.378
Hold, uh, wait, wait, wait.
Hold, please.

19:05.412 --> 19:08.915
Uh, when is this stuff
gonna wear off?

19:08.948 --> 19:10.850
(echoes):
A few hours.

19:10.883 --> 19:13.553
You will barely remember
a thing.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.690
Enjoy.
(door slams)

19:17.724 --> 19:21.961
BARTOK: So, my granddaughter,
who despises me,

19:21.994 --> 19:25.432
calls me out of the blue
to make peace in the family.

19:26.799 --> 19:30.270
Okay... selfish request.

19:30.303 --> 19:33.206
I'm writing a story,
and I need some help.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.541
Uh-uh-uh.
I thought we discussed this.

19:34.574 --> 19:35.842
Cashing in on my name

19:35.875 --> 19:37.710
is just not allowed.
No. I already have a publisher

19:37.744 --> 19:39.912
that's interested, and they
have no idea that I am

19:39.946 --> 19:43.416
the granddaughter of
the great Andre Bartok,

19:43.450 --> 19:46.353
author of The 360.

19:46.386 --> 19:48.421
I'm just having trouble
with the main character.

19:48.455 --> 19:50.657
Well, imagine that.

19:50.690 --> 19:53.893
The author of ShadowSide
needs my advice.

19:53.926 --> 19:55.728
(chuckles)
God.

19:55.762 --> 19:57.664
Mom was right.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.966
You really just can't be nice,
can you?

19:59.999 --> 20:01.568
Nice is overrated.

20:01.601 --> 20:04.804
So... the question.

20:04.837 --> 20:07.274
What is the question?

20:07.307 --> 20:11.444
If my lead character
has a secret...

20:11.478 --> 20:14.247
that the world may
come to an end...

20:15.448 --> 20:19.286
...what is her responsibility
to the people around her?

20:19.319 --> 20:22.822
Does she tell them so
they can make choices

20:22.855 --> 20:24.791
on how they spend
their last days?

20:24.824 --> 20:27.327
Or does she keep the
secret to herself

20:27.360 --> 20:29.396
so she doesn't destroy

20:29.429 --> 20:31.531
whatever happiness
is left in the world?

20:31.564 --> 20:35.034
What kind of a person is she?
What makes her tick?

20:35.067 --> 20:36.969
She's decent.

20:37.003 --> 20:39.038
She likes to
think she is,

20:39.071 --> 20:41.708
and she wants to do
the right thing.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.476
People are not, you know,
innately good.

20:43.510 --> 20:46.413
They don't want to
do the right thing.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.415
They want to
do the wrong thing,

20:48.448 --> 20:50.450
but society confines them.

20:50.483 --> 20:52.819
(sighs)
This was a terrible idea.

20:52.852 --> 20:54.854
I'm sorry I even brought it up.

21:00.393 --> 21:02.595
The POTUS wants to know
where things stand.

21:02.629 --> 21:04.297
DEXTER:
According to our calculations,

21:04.331 --> 21:07.467
Samson will cross the
Rubicon Line in five days.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.302
If we don't launch our
gravity tractor before then,

21:09.336 --> 21:11.538
it won't be able to reach the
asteroid in time to deflect it.

21:11.571 --> 21:14.307
Then we have to find a way
to launch in five days

21:14.341 --> 21:17.043
without Russian interference.
Cape Canaveral's
the ideal location.

21:17.076 --> 21:19.446
Unfortunately,

21:19.479 --> 21:21.781
thermal imaging shows
what we believe

21:21.814 --> 21:23.950
are Russian nuclear subs
off the coast of Florida,

21:23.983 --> 21:25.652
in international waters.

21:25.685 --> 21:27.654
They're in optimal
firing position.

21:27.687 --> 21:29.389
If we arm our rocket
with IR flares

21:29.422 --> 21:32.058
and activate every Terminal High
Altitude Area Defense missile,

21:32.091 --> 21:33.593
we may stand a chance.

21:33.626 --> 21:35.328
And if we do that,
what are the odds

21:35.362 --> 21:36.463
our rocket
makes it through?

21:36.496 --> 21:38.531
At best, 50-50.

21:38.565 --> 21:40.567
(Harris sighs)

21:40.600 --> 21:42.502
I'm not willing to bet
the fate of the planet

21:42.535 --> 21:43.670
on a coin toss.

21:43.703 --> 21:45.605
Unless the Russians
decide to stand down

21:45.638 --> 21:48.875
and let us launch this
damn thing, we may have to.

21:52.479 --> 21:53.813
Russia conducted a test
(doorbell rings)

21:53.846 --> 21:55.948
of a banned cruise missile
this morning

21:55.982 --> 22:00.353
in brazen violation of
several nuclear treaties.

22:00.387 --> 22:02.489
At the same time, the Russian
embassy shuddered its doors...

22:02.522 --> 22:04.424
Dylan.
Zoe.

22:04.457 --> 22:05.525
Come on in.

22:11.731 --> 22:15.468
GRACE:
What if they never let us out?

22:15.502 --> 22:17.069
What if this is how we die,

22:17.103 --> 22:21.040
in a seedy flat in Moscow?

22:21.073 --> 22:25.044
They've got some
great LPs here.

22:28.047 --> 22:30.950
Care to listen to some music
before you die?

22:30.983 --> 22:33.720
Just said I don't want
to die here.

22:33.753 --> 22:36.723
I can't change
what happens, all right?

22:36.756 --> 22:40.727
But I can change the ambience.

22:42.762 --> 22:45.865
("The Nearness of You"
by Ella Fitzgerald playing)

22:45.898 --> 22:49.902
* It's not the pale moon

22:49.936 --> 22:53.740
This is so beautiful.

22:53.773 --> 22:56.075
I love Ella Fitzgerald.

22:56.108 --> 22:58.978
(sighs) Me, too.

22:59.011 --> 23:01.548
* Oh, no

23:01.581 --> 23:04.484
What will you miss, Grace?

23:04.517 --> 23:05.885
Most of all.

23:05.918 --> 23:08.187
* It's just the nearness
of you *

23:08.220 --> 23:10.156
If the world ends?

23:10.189 --> 23:11.558
I die here?

23:11.591 --> 23:14.694
Yes.

23:14.727 --> 23:17.029
* It isn't
your sweet conversation *

23:17.063 --> 23:18.565
Zoe.

23:18.598 --> 23:20.433
* That brings this sensation

23:20.467 --> 23:22.502
(chuckles, sniffles)

23:22.535 --> 23:25.605
Her laugh. Her smile.

23:25.638 --> 23:27.807
Cherry blossoms.

23:27.840 --> 23:30.710
Spring.

23:30.743 --> 23:32.144
Springsteen.

23:32.178 --> 23:33.880
(chuckles softly)

23:33.913 --> 23:35.715
Love.

23:35.748 --> 23:38.585
(sniffles)
Not love songs.

23:38.618 --> 23:40.186
Sex.

23:40.219 --> 23:42.755
The good kind.

23:42.789 --> 23:45.592
* And I feel you
so close to me *

23:45.625 --> 23:47.026
Is there a bad kind?

23:47.059 --> 23:49.562
(scoffs) Please.
My marriage.

23:49.596 --> 23:51.197
Did I just say that
out loud?

23:51.230 --> 23:53.533
(both laugh)

23:53.566 --> 23:55.067
Oh.

23:55.101 --> 23:57.036
* All my wildest dreams
come true *

23:57.069 --> 23:58.871
What about you?

23:58.905 --> 24:00.172
What will you miss?

24:00.206 --> 24:02.575
* I need no soft lights

24:02.609 --> 24:04.176
All the stuff they're defunding.

24:04.210 --> 24:07.179
Music, art,
literature, dancing.

24:07.213 --> 24:10.082
Dancing?

24:10.116 --> 24:11.784
What?

24:11.818 --> 24:14.787
Really?

24:14.821 --> 24:16.923
You just don't strike me
as the type,

24:16.956 --> 24:19.492
the romantic type.

24:19.526 --> 24:20.760
That's all.

24:20.793 --> 24:22.695
I happen to be quite romantic

24:22.729 --> 24:24.831
when the right woman
comes along.

24:24.864 --> 24:28.000
Or even the wrong one,
for that matter.

24:28.034 --> 24:29.168
I have your number.

24:29.201 --> 24:31.538
I do.

24:31.571 --> 24:33.673
You just make everyone
feel like they're the one.

24:33.706 --> 24:35.508
They are.

24:35.542 --> 24:37.710
In the moment.

24:37.744 --> 24:41.280
* It's not the pale moon

24:41.313 --> 24:42.949
* That excites me

24:42.982 --> 24:44.951
(sniffles)

24:44.984 --> 24:46.686
This can't be it, Darius.

24:46.719 --> 24:48.521
It just can't.

24:48.555 --> 24:50.523
* That thrills and delights me

24:50.557 --> 24:52.291
* Oh, no

24:52.324 --> 24:54.561
Grace.

24:54.594 --> 24:56.796
I'm sorry. I...

24:56.829 --> 24:58.297
I dragged you here.

24:58.330 --> 25:00.166
I-I dragged you
into everything.

25:00.199 --> 25:02.168
No. No, I dragged myself.

25:02.201 --> 25:05.605
No regrets, okay?

25:05.638 --> 25:07.707
At least I know
I did everything I could

25:07.740 --> 25:11.210
to save this...
dumbass planet.

25:11.243 --> 25:12.712
* That brings this sensation

25:12.745 --> 25:14.146
(both laugh)

25:14.180 --> 25:16.583
* Oh, no

25:16.616 --> 25:18.685
(sniffles)

25:18.718 --> 25:20.319
(whispers): It is
pretty dumbass.

25:20.352 --> 25:22.622
(sighs)

25:26.826 --> 25:28.828
Do you really like dancing?

25:31.664 --> 25:33.265
Me, too.

25:33.299 --> 25:35.234
*

25:48.114 --> 25:49.682
(laughs)

25:49.716 --> 25:50.750
You were right.

25:50.783 --> 25:52.785
You are good at this.

25:54.353 --> 25:56.923
I like this Darius.

25:56.956 --> 25:59.859
Dancing Darius.

26:03.029 --> 26:04.831
And I like you, Grace.

26:04.864 --> 26:07.900
Ever since I saw you
at the Croatian embassy.

26:07.934 --> 26:11.771
* When you're in my arms

26:11.804 --> 26:14.774
You kissed me today.

26:14.807 --> 26:16.375
The train station.

26:16.408 --> 26:18.945
I'm sorry. I should
have asked permission.

26:18.978 --> 26:21.648
* So close to me

26:21.681 --> 26:24.116
Permission granted.

26:24.150 --> 26:26.919
For then?

26:26.953 --> 26:28.755
* All my wildest dreams
come true *

26:28.788 --> 26:31.390
Or now?

26:31.423 --> 26:33.860
* I need no soft lights

26:33.893 --> 26:36.629
Both.

26:36.663 --> 26:39.365
* To enchant me

26:39.398 --> 26:44.771
* If you'll only grant me

26:44.804 --> 26:46.372
If you tell me
to stop, I will.

26:46.405 --> 26:48.908
* The right

26:48.941 --> 26:50.777
What if I don't?

26:50.810 --> 26:54.681
* To hold you ever so tight

26:54.714 --> 26:56.883
* And to feel

26:56.916 --> 26:59.886
* In the night

26:59.919 --> 27:05.057
* The nearness of you.

27:16.703 --> 27:17.704
DYLAN:
So, our parents are dating.

27:17.737 --> 27:19.005
For how long?

27:19.038 --> 27:20.673
(chuckles)
I don't know.

27:20.707 --> 27:24.343
At least a year, I think.
(chuckles)

27:24.376 --> 27:26.078
She would kill me

27:26.112 --> 27:27.446
if she knew
I reached out.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.048
She's so secretive.

27:29.081 --> 27:31.217
Oh, tell me about it.
My dad is a vault.

27:31.250 --> 27:32.218
(chuckles softly)

27:32.251 --> 27:35.688
So, where is
your mom right now?

27:35.722 --> 27:37.389
Some business trip
with Darius Tanz.

27:37.423 --> 27:41.060
Any idea what
they're working on?

27:41.093 --> 27:42.895
She doesn't tell me anything.

27:42.929 --> 27:45.097
For all I know, she's
in the CIA or something.

27:45.131 --> 27:46.332
(both laugh)

27:46.365 --> 27:50.002
It's nice.

27:50.036 --> 27:52.071
Meeting someone that understands
what it's like

27:52.104 --> 27:55.241
to grow up feeling like
you don't really know your mom.

27:55.274 --> 27:56.776
Or your dad.

27:58.444 --> 28:00.112
It's so lonely.

28:00.146 --> 28:01.313
I hate it.

28:01.347 --> 28:04.416
Me, too.

28:10.422 --> 28:12.859
Thank you...

28:12.892 --> 28:16.228
for pulling all this
together.

28:16.262 --> 28:18.264
You deserve to
be happy, Dad.

28:18.297 --> 28:20.933
So do you.

28:20.967 --> 28:22.769
I get a feeling

28:22.802 --> 28:24.436
that you want
to tell me something.

28:24.470 --> 28:26.205
You know
you can talk to me, right?

28:26.238 --> 28:27.473
About anything.

28:29.141 --> 28:31.043
I know.

28:35.147 --> 28:37.349
DANIEL:
Who's that?

28:37.383 --> 28:39.251
A friend.

28:39.285 --> 28:41.253
Can you excuse me a second?

28:41.287 --> 28:43.355
Yeah.

28:43.389 --> 28:46.092
What are you doing?

28:46.125 --> 28:47.126
You can't just show up here.

28:47.159 --> 28:49.395
I know, but you wouldn't
answer any of my calls,

28:49.428 --> 28:51.263
any of my texts.

28:53.199 --> 28:56.202
Look, forget about us
for a second.

28:56.235 --> 28:57.904
(sighs)

28:57.937 --> 28:59.338
The Ark Project needs you.

28:59.371 --> 29:01.540
That guy Mason,
he can't get it done.

29:01.573 --> 29:03.075
(sighs)

29:03.109 --> 29:05.377
Look, I'm sorry.

29:05.411 --> 29:09.448
I'm sorry if I made
the wrong choices.

29:11.450 --> 29:13.019
But there-there's no blueprint

29:13.052 --> 29:15.054
for what is happening
to us right now.

29:15.087 --> 29:16.522
* I see skies of blue

29:16.555 --> 29:19.391
* And clouds of white

29:19.425 --> 29:21.393
Look, all I know
is you inspired me

29:21.427 --> 29:23.329
to try to save the world.

29:23.362 --> 29:25.397
And, uh...

29:25.431 --> 29:27.333
* The dark, sacred night

29:27.366 --> 29:28.801
I want to do the same.

29:28.835 --> 29:30.236
* And I think to myself

29:30.269 --> 29:32.905
Liam...

29:32.939 --> 29:34.406
* What a wonderful world

29:34.440 --> 29:37.243
I don't have what it takes
to go back there.

29:37.276 --> 29:39.278
To Tanz. I'm sorry.

29:41.413 --> 29:43.983
This is where I belong.

29:44.016 --> 29:47.353
* So pretty in the sky

29:47.386 --> 29:48.554
Well, uh...

29:48.587 --> 29:50.456
* Are also on the faces

29:50.489 --> 29:51.891
Before I go...

29:51.924 --> 29:53.525
* Of people going by

29:53.559 --> 29:55.494
...maybe one dance?

29:55.527 --> 29:58.564
For old times' sake.

29:58.597 --> 30:01.467
* Saying, "How do you do?"

30:03.469 --> 30:05.371
* They're really saying

30:05.404 --> 30:08.207
* "I love you"

30:08.240 --> 30:12.111
* I hear babies cry

30:12.144 --> 30:15.581
* I watch them grow

30:15.614 --> 30:18.584
* They'll learn much more

30:18.617 --> 30:21.420
* Than I'll ever know

30:21.453 --> 30:24.456
* And I think to myself

30:26.558 --> 30:29.128
* What a wonderful world

30:29.161 --> 30:30.863
If I didn't know any better,

30:30.897 --> 30:32.932
I'd say your daughter
was in love.

30:32.965 --> 30:34.400
Hmm.

30:34.433 --> 30:36.368
Then why does she
look so damn sad?

30:36.402 --> 30:38.437
* Yes, I think to myself

30:40.439 --> 30:45.577
* What a wonderful world

30:50.549 --> 30:53.619
* Oh, yeah.

30:55.554 --> 30:57.523
(record scratching)

30:57.556 --> 30:59.558
(door unlocks, opens)

30:59.591 --> 31:01.060
(footsteps approaching)

31:01.093 --> 31:02.294
Hmm?
Grace.

31:02.328 --> 31:03.429
Oh.

31:03.462 --> 31:05.431
Mr. Tanz.

31:05.464 --> 31:07.533
Ms. Barrows.

31:07.566 --> 31:11.537
I presented your proposal
to my government.

31:14.206 --> 31:15.574
It has been accepted.

31:15.607 --> 31:17.376
When you return to
the United States,

31:17.409 --> 31:20.546
have your defense secretary
reach out to me

31:20.579 --> 31:21.914
to arrange the details.

31:21.948 --> 31:23.549
Thank you,
Minister Toporov.

31:23.582 --> 31:25.184
I'll see to it.

31:25.217 --> 31:27.186
Yes. Um...

31:28.955 --> 31:31.557
And yours, Mr. Tanz.

31:31.590 --> 31:32.658
Ms. Barrows.

31:32.691 --> 31:34.693
(speaking Russian)

31:34.726 --> 31:37.529
(footsteps retreating)

31:47.106 --> 31:50.042
Harris.

31:50.076 --> 31:52.244
Tanz's plane has made contact.

31:54.013 --> 31:56.548
Grace and Darius
have been released.

31:56.582 --> 31:57.583
They're on
their way back.

31:57.616 --> 31:59.051
When are they due to land?

31:59.085 --> 32:00.919
Five hours.

32:13.665 --> 32:15.467
Zoe?

32:15.501 --> 32:17.203
(keys rattle)

32:17.236 --> 32:18.437
Mom?

32:18.470 --> 32:20.639
Hi.

32:22.741 --> 32:24.043
Harris?

32:24.076 --> 32:25.311
That won't be necessary.

32:25.344 --> 32:26.545
What's going on?

32:26.578 --> 32:28.314
Grace Barrows,
you're under arrest.

32:28.347 --> 32:29.281
What?

32:29.315 --> 32:31.183
For violation of the Logan Act.

32:31.217 --> 32:33.119
Conducting unauthorized
negotiations

32:33.152 --> 32:34.686
with a hostile
foreign government.

32:34.720 --> 32:36.155
Let's go.
No.

32:36.188 --> 32:37.589
Honey, it's just
a misunderstanding.

32:37.623 --> 32:40.226
Go to your father's until
you hear from me, okay?

32:40.259 --> 32:42.428
It's okay.

32:42.461 --> 32:43.996
And call Darius Tanz. Now.

32:49.735 --> 32:51.137
So...

32:51.170 --> 32:53.672
Jillian, your-your question,

32:53.705 --> 32:57.076
are you still looking
for an answer?

32:57.109 --> 33:01.547
I'm not really in the mood to
be mocked right now, Granddad.

33:01.580 --> 33:04.316
Ignorance is bliss,
that's what I say.

33:04.350 --> 33:08.754
What? Since when do you adhere
to bumper sticker philosophy?

33:08.787 --> 33:11.490
Since I saw that
look on your face

33:11.523 --> 33:13.325
yesterday.

33:13.359 --> 33:15.594
I don't know
what you know,

33:15.627 --> 33:17.596
but if it's gonna cause
the kind of heartache

33:17.629 --> 33:20.599
I saw in your face...

33:20.632 --> 33:22.601
the world has enough

33:22.634 --> 33:25.804
heartache right now,
don't you think?

33:25.837 --> 33:27.639
When your mother
was sick,

33:27.673 --> 33:32.278
the doctors told her she
had six months to live.

33:32.311 --> 33:35.547
But she lost all hope
and she only lasted three.

33:35.581 --> 33:39.618
That boy,
whoever he is...

33:39.651 --> 33:42.621
he gives you hope.

33:45.457 --> 33:48.127
Happiness is fleeting.

33:48.160 --> 33:51.763
Grab it like a firefly.

33:51.797 --> 33:55.367
Never let it go.

33:56.635 --> 33:58.637
(Laura laughing)

34:07.246 --> 34:10.749
(door opens, closes)

34:23.595 --> 34:25.764
(exhales)

34:27.433 --> 34:30.369
The lies never stop
with you, do they?

34:30.402 --> 34:33.472
That's not fair.
You went behind my back

34:33.505 --> 34:37.443
to Russia with Darius.

34:37.476 --> 34:39.745
What did you think
you'd accomplish?

34:39.778 --> 34:42.448
Something no one else
here could, obviously.

34:42.481 --> 34:43.882
Diplomacy, and we did.

34:43.915 --> 34:46.618
(chuckles)
Yeah, that's right.

34:46.652 --> 34:49.721
You and Darius Tanz
saving the world

34:49.755 --> 34:51.457
from us evil
government shills.

34:51.490 --> 34:52.624
Where is this coming from?

34:52.658 --> 34:54.160
Why don't I lay
it out for you...

34:54.193 --> 34:55.761
one earring at a time.

34:55.794 --> 34:59.131
Oh. Yeah.

34:59.165 --> 35:01.800
You broke into
my briefcase,

35:01.833 --> 35:04.736
stole my nuclear access codes.

35:04.770 --> 35:07.773
What exactly were you doing
with four barrels

35:07.806 --> 35:10.242
of enriched uranium, Grace?

35:12.711 --> 35:14.346
Nothing...

35:14.380 --> 35:16.815
compared to what you
did in Chelyabinsk.

35:18.450 --> 35:20.219
N-- it was a mistake.

35:20.252 --> 35:21.820
A weapons test that went wrong.

35:21.853 --> 35:24.790
That asteroid was supposed to
land in uninhabited terrain,

35:24.823 --> 35:26.892
but it went off course.
Our government developed

35:26.925 --> 35:28.560
a weapon of mass destruction

35:28.594 --> 35:29.828
designed to have
no fingerprints,

35:29.861 --> 35:31.430
no accountability.

35:31.463 --> 35:32.731
And that doesn't disturb you?

35:32.764 --> 35:34.733
No one died there, Grace.

35:34.766 --> 35:36.235
No.

35:36.268 --> 35:38.437
But how many people were
killed to cover it up?

35:40.739 --> 35:43.275
You still can't answer that.

35:43.309 --> 35:45.877
Or won't.

35:45.911 --> 35:49.348
I can't help you
anymore, Grace.

35:49.381 --> 35:51.550
Frankly, I'm not sure

35:51.583 --> 35:52.884
I want to.

35:57.756 --> 36:01.460
(door opens, slams)

36:03.562 --> 36:05.197
Oh, sir.
Hold all my calls.

36:05.231 --> 36:06.732
But, sir...

36:08.667 --> 36:10.869
Get the hell out of my office
or I'll have you thrown out.

36:10.902 --> 36:11.970
Where's Grace?

36:12.003 --> 36:13.905
Wh-what have you
done with her?

36:13.939 --> 36:15.841
She's been arrested.
For what?

36:15.874 --> 36:18.210
Saving your incompetent asses?

36:18.244 --> 36:19.878
She violated the Logan Act,
conducting foreign relations

36:19.911 --> 36:20.912
without authority.

36:20.946 --> 36:22.314
The Logan Act?

36:22.348 --> 36:23.849
A-An obscure law

36:23.882 --> 36:25.684
that's never been used
to prosecute anyone,

36:25.717 --> 36:27.219
including me, strangely.

36:27.253 --> 36:29.888
What you do as a private citizen
is not my business.

36:29.921 --> 36:32.724
Grace is a government employee
who exceeded her authority.

36:35.861 --> 36:37.896
You petty son of a bitch.

36:37.929 --> 36:39.631
This is personal,
and we both know it.

36:39.665 --> 36:41.300
She's become a completely
different person

36:41.333 --> 36:42.568
since she met you.

36:42.601 --> 36:45.471
Yes. Courageous,
bold, passionate.

36:45.504 --> 36:47.773
Everything you're
not, thankfully.

36:47.806 --> 36:49.408
Go on, do it.

36:52.611 --> 36:54.446
Just get the hell
out of here. Go!

36:55.981 --> 36:58.650
Before I do something
I'll regret.

36:58.684 --> 37:01.553
I imagine you already have.

37:06.892 --> 37:09.495
If you don't release Grace,
I'll go to the press.

37:09.528 --> 37:11.630
Tell them everything--
asteroid,

37:11.663 --> 37:13.399
Atlas, and that's
just the "A"s.

37:13.432 --> 37:15.267
I'll burn it
all down, Harris.

37:15.301 --> 37:17.769
And don't get any ideas about
black site prisons and the like.

37:17.803 --> 37:19.305
I've got a dozen
lawyers standing by

37:19.338 --> 37:20.872
with my sworn statement
in their hands.

37:20.906 --> 37:22.941
If I disappear,

37:22.974 --> 37:26.478
they've been instructed
to release it immediately.

37:26.512 --> 37:29.681
You've got ten minutes
before I go nuclear.

37:31.383 --> 37:33.385
(door slams)

37:39.358 --> 37:40.759
CALHOUN:
Yes, we anticipate

37:40.792 --> 37:42.661
your team's arrival.

37:42.694 --> 37:44.930
Speaking for everyone here
at the Pentagon,

37:44.963 --> 37:46.932
we look forward
to the glasnost

37:46.965 --> 37:49.000
between our two countries.

37:51.537 --> 37:53.905
I assume that was the
Russian defense minister.

37:53.939 --> 37:56.942
Yes. They're standing down.

37:56.975 --> 37:58.610
Closing their silos?
CALHOUN: And their subs

37:58.644 --> 38:02.080
have been ordered to retreat
from the Florida peninsula.

38:02.113 --> 38:05.484
Darius has threatened
to go public with all of it

38:05.517 --> 38:06.985
if we don't release
Grace Barrows.

38:07.018 --> 38:08.920
Well, the Russians say
there's no deal

38:08.954 --> 38:11.457
unless Grace and Darius run
point on this operation.

38:11.490 --> 38:15.327
Seems they're the only ones
the Russians trust.

38:15.361 --> 38:18.897
And the only ones we don't.

38:24.403 --> 38:26.037
(rock music playing)

38:29.841 --> 38:31.377
Hey.

38:31.410 --> 38:34.646
I didn't expect
to see you back so soon.

38:34.680 --> 38:35.814
* Trust me

38:35.847 --> 38:37.583
How'd it go...

38:37.616 --> 38:39.585
your choice?

38:39.618 --> 38:43.054
Uh, it went.

38:43.088 --> 38:45.957
That sounds like another double.

38:45.991 --> 38:47.125
It's last call.

38:47.158 --> 38:49.928
Thanks, but...

38:49.961 --> 38:52.097
I didn't come
for the bourbon.

38:52.130 --> 38:55.767
I came for the company.

38:55.801 --> 38:57.969
Well, I'm...

38:58.003 --> 39:00.439
really good company.

39:00.472 --> 39:04.142
* I'm all-in

39:04.175 --> 39:07.112
* I'm all-in

39:07.145 --> 39:08.480
* Ready, draw

39:08.514 --> 39:10.582
* This means

39:10.616 --> 39:13.819
* It's up to us

39:13.852 --> 39:16.455
* Ready, go.

39:33.639 --> 39:36.408
Hey.

39:36.442 --> 39:38.043
You're back.

39:40.011 --> 39:42.748
(sighs)

39:42.781 --> 39:44.082
Two conditions.

39:44.115 --> 39:46.017
First...

39:48.620 --> 39:49.955
...I'm gonna
lead the room.

39:49.988 --> 39:51.557
Done.

39:55.093 --> 39:57.028
And the other thing?

39:58.664 --> 40:01.633
I want to know what
I'm really working on.

40:34.099 --> 40:36.602
LIAM:
It's almost done.

40:36.635 --> 40:38.770
All that's left is...

40:38.804 --> 40:40.138
Are the people?
Yeah.

40:40.171 --> 40:43.775
JILLIAN:
The 160.

40:43.809 --> 40:46.111
LIAM: Here's hoping
we never need it.

40:48.647 --> 40:51.683
I couldn't do it,
either, Liam.

40:51.717 --> 40:55.887
I couldn't tell my father
or any of them the truth.

40:55.921 --> 40:58.123
And I understand...

41:01.627 --> 41:04.663
...how much you must...

41:04.696 --> 41:07.065
love me...

41:09.234 --> 41:11.202
to have kept
that secret.

41:30.121 --> 41:31.156
(door opens)

41:33.925 --> 41:35.060
Zoe?

41:37.228 --> 41:40.999
Uh, well, her car's
not outside, so...

41:45.203 --> 41:49.174
Thank you for
getting me out.

41:49.207 --> 41:52.210
We did good.

41:52.243 --> 41:56.147
We accomplished what our
own government couldn't.

41:56.181 --> 41:58.283
How am I supposed to
ever go back there?

41:58.316 --> 42:00.185
I mean, after
everything that's happened.

42:00.218 --> 42:02.721
You have to.

42:02.754 --> 42:04.055
Until we see this through.

42:04.089 --> 42:05.223
Just...

42:05.256 --> 42:07.793
just focus on
the ultimate goal,

42:07.826 --> 42:09.628
and, and...

42:09.661 --> 42:12.964
take emotion out
of the equation.

42:12.998 --> 42:16.167
If only it were
that simple.

42:25.744 --> 42:28.179
A good evening to you,
Mrs. Petrovic.

42:28.213 --> 42:32.684
(laughs): And to you,
Mr. Petrovic.

42:32.718 --> 42:34.920
And remember...

42:38.256 --> 42:40.325
(laughs)

42:40.358 --> 42:42.628
But...

42:42.661 --> 42:45.230
only if you want it to.
