21:47.055 --> 21:49.390
[laughter]

21:49.516 --> 21:51.350
- So what would you like to do?

21:55.355 --> 21:56.897
You're so beautiful.

21:57.024 --> 22:00.568
[laughter]

22:02.738 --> 22:04.530
Damn.

22:06.199 --> 22:07.450
So naughty.

22:07.576 --> 22:08.868
- You're smiling.

22:08.994 --> 22:11.245
You'd rather shoot my misery.

22:11.371 --> 22:12.538
- You know Joany?

22:12.664 --> 22:13.789
- Yeah.

22:13.915 --> 22:16.125
- You know she's my girlfriend?

22:16.251 --> 22:17.418
You have very nice breasts.

22:17.544 --> 22:20.087
Joany, what do you think
of these boobs?

22:20.213 --> 22:21.589
Aw, Joany's jealous.

22:21.715 --> 22:23.215
- Stop it!
Stop!

22:25.010 --> 22:26.135
Why don't you get involved?

22:26.261 --> 22:28.179
- Ew, you were just kissing
someone eIse.

22:28.305 --> 22:29.889
Don't come near me.

22:30.015 --> 22:33.142
l'm gonna go out, and l'm gonna
go fuck someone, a guy.

22:33.268 --> 22:35.227
- You're gonna go fuck someone?
- Yeah.

22:40.442 --> 22:42.485
Don't you patronize me,
you undersized little whore.

22:42.611 --> 22:43.611
And stop fucking filming me.

22:43.737 --> 22:44.653
- A whore?

22:44.780 --> 22:47.490
- You only love
your fucking self.

22:47.616 --> 22:49.283
- Matter of fact, yeah.

22:49.409 --> 22:52.787
Do you want to see me, Joany,
being fucked?

22:54.122 --> 22:55.956
- Wow.

22:56.083 --> 22:57.333
- Jesus fucking Christ!

22:57.459 --> 22:58.793
- l love it.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.797
lt's so real.

23:02.923 --> 23:04.965
- Thanks, Beth.
That means a lot.

23:05.092 --> 23:06.842
l mean, you're the first person
I've shown it to.

23:06.968 --> 23:08.636
- Really?

23:08.804 --> 23:12.765
- l don't know.
l just felt you'd understand it.

23:12.891 --> 23:14.850
- l really appreciate that.

23:14.976 --> 23:16.477
l think it really works.

23:16.603 --> 23:18.145
lt's really revealing.

23:18.271 --> 23:21.190
lt's very daring.

23:33.578 --> 23:34.620
- Ah!

23:35.956 --> 23:37.998
- Watch it!

23:49.052 --> 23:50.970
[door creaking]

23:51.096 --> 23:54.348
- What do you think, Jean?

23:54.474 --> 23:56.809
l like the space around it,

23:56.935 --> 24:01.147
gives it air to breathe.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.858
- l liked it better
next to Turk's Warhol.

24:03.984 --> 24:04.984
- You do?

24:05.110 --> 24:06.819
- I mean,
Andy would have approved.

24:06.945 --> 24:10.322
- lt's just absolutely wasted
over there.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.741
- l don't like it.

24:12.868 --> 24:15.411
- You don't like old Constantin?

24:15.537 --> 24:17.246
- No, l love Brancusi.

24:17.372 --> 24:19.123
l just don't like it.

24:19.249 --> 24:20.332
- Brancush.

24:20.459 --> 24:23.002
lt's not Brancusi.
It's Brancush.

24:23.128 --> 24:25.129
- Don't be such a snob, Bob.

24:25.255 --> 24:27.882
- l'm not being a snob.

24:28.008 --> 24:30.468
I just think you shouId caII
people by their proper name.

24:30.594 --> 24:32.845
- Well, it's not "Par-ee,"
is it?

24:32.971 --> 24:34.013
lt's Paris.

24:34.139 --> 24:35.639
- That's different.

24:35.765 --> 24:37.725
- Why?

24:37.851 --> 24:40.686
- lt was never meant
to be Brancusi.

24:40.812 --> 24:42.229
lt's Brancush.

24:42.355 --> 24:44.565
- [sighs]

24:44.691 --> 24:46.233
[groans]

25:06.880 --> 25:07.922
[sighs]

25:10.550 --> 25:11.800
- Bob?

25:11.927 --> 25:14.303
l've got something unbelievable,

25:14.429 --> 25:15.346
unbelievable.

25:15.472 --> 25:17.890
l mean, l'm not sure l can say,

25:18.016 --> 25:19.517
'cause it's not quite
a done deal, but-

25:19.643 --> 25:20.893
- You can tell me, Art.

25:21.019 --> 25:22.228
Come on, tell me.

25:22.354 --> 25:24.647
- "Boogie Woogie."

25:24.773 --> 25:26.899
- Wow, unbelievable.

25:27.025 --> 25:30.152
- [laughs]
Yep, first in the series.

25:30.278 --> 25:31.820
- The first "Boogie Woogie"?

25:31.947 --> 25:33.614
[door buzzing]

25:33.740 --> 25:35.366
Must be worth a fortune.

25:35.492 --> 25:36.534
- Oh, it's priceless,

25:36.660 --> 25:38.244
priceless.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.829
- Okay, so how much?

25:40.956 --> 25:42.164
- Oh, l don't know.

25:42.290 --> 25:43.290
l don't know.

25:43.416 --> 25:45.209
[laughs]

25:45.335 --> 25:47.962
Oh, well, at least 20 million.

25:48.088 --> 25:49.672
- 20 mil, wow.

25:49.798 --> 25:51.423
- Yeah.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.884
l tell you, it's a beauty.

25:54.010 --> 25:55.928
- Hello, it's Dewey.

25:56.054 --> 25:57.638
Anyone home?

25:57.764 --> 25:59.890
- Oh, here they are.

26:00.016 --> 26:01.016
- Hi.

26:01.142 --> 26:02.893
- Hello.

26:03.019 --> 26:03.894
- How are you doing?

26:04.020 --> 26:05.062
- l'm just gonna get my coat.

26:05.188 --> 26:06.063
Come on.

26:06.189 --> 26:08.524
[dogs whimpering]

26:08.650 --> 26:10.734
Light.

26:10.860 --> 26:13.946
- Wow, you've been
changing things around a bit.

26:14.072 --> 26:17.449
- Yes, you know,
here and there.

26:17.576 --> 26:18.701
- That's good.

26:18.827 --> 26:21.412
- All right.

26:21.538 --> 26:22.621
Can you bring them back by tea?

26:22.747 --> 26:23.664
- Sure.

26:23.790 --> 26:24.707
- Great.
- No probs.

26:24.833 --> 26:26.292
- All right.
Let's go.

26:26.418 --> 26:29.420
- Did l tell you
that we've got

26:29.546 --> 26:31.797
Larry Oppenheimer's
daughter here?

26:31.923 --> 26:33.591
- Larry Oppenheimer's daughter?

26:33.717 --> 26:35.217
ls she cute?

26:35.343 --> 26:37.678
- She's real cute
and determined.

26:37.804 --> 26:38.846
[laughs]

26:38.972 --> 26:40.806
- You know,
that fraud investigation,

26:40.932 --> 26:43.142
that wiped out her dad,
didn't it?

26:43.268 --> 26:44.977
- Yeah, weII,
goddamn intrusive government.

26:45.103 --> 26:46.145
That's what l say.

26:46.271 --> 26:48.105
I mean, he was
one of my best clients.

26:48.231 --> 26:49.607
- What happened
to his collection?

26:49.733 --> 26:51.191
- l got his collection
right here.

26:51.318 --> 26:55.654
[laughs]

26:55.780 --> 26:58.490
Oh, are you coming
to my dinner, Bob?

26:58.617 --> 26:59.491
- Oh, we sure are.

26:59.618 --> 27:00.534
- Okay.

27:00.660 --> 27:01.577
- So l'll see you then.

27:01.703 --> 27:02.536
- Bye.
- Bye.

27:02.662 --> 27:03.704
[phone beeps]

27:14.966 --> 27:17.968
- Alfred, we really must talk.

27:18.094 --> 27:19.345
- What about?

27:19.471 --> 27:21.972
- About our financial situation.

27:22.098 --> 27:24.600
- lt's not so bad.

27:24.726 --> 27:28.020
- Darling, we're down
to our last beans.

27:28.146 --> 27:30.606
- Don't be ridiculous.

27:30.732 --> 27:34.526
- I've just had the quote
from the insurance company.

27:34.653 --> 27:39.114
- l have nothing else to sell.

27:39.240 --> 27:40.532
- We have the "Boogie Woogie."

27:46.247 --> 27:49.249
- You want to sell
the Mondrian?

27:49.376 --> 27:52.419
l got it from the master
himself.

27:52.545 --> 27:53.962
lt is a masterpiece,

27:54.089 --> 27:55.923
a meisterwerk.

27:56.049 --> 27:58.008
- [sighs]

27:58.134 --> 28:01.136
- You want to sell off
our most prized possessions.

28:01.262 --> 28:02.638
And for what?

28:02.764 --> 28:05.140
To pay a few lousy bills?

28:05.266 --> 28:08.852
l went to the studio
of Mondrian,

28:08.978 --> 28:12.439
and l bought it from him.

28:12.565 --> 28:16.360
It's been a part
of my collection.

28:16.486 --> 28:19.530
lt is the envy of all London.

28:19.656 --> 28:22.116
l am known for that painting.

28:23.743 --> 28:24.660
- Spindle?

28:24.786 --> 28:27.830
- 16 million.

28:38.883 --> 28:42.052
- DarIing, you've Iived
with the painting for 50 years.

28:42.178 --> 28:43.345
Now it's time for somebody else

28:43.471 --> 28:44.722
to have the pleasure
of owning it.

28:44.848 --> 28:48.600
And besides, we can collect
other artists.

28:48.727 --> 28:51.895
- They're all shit.

28:52.021 --> 28:55.357
lt's like trading gold
for potatoes.

28:55.483 --> 28:58.694
And you,
why are you standing there?

28:58.820 --> 29:02.406
This is a private conversation.

29:12.208 --> 29:14.960
Always snooping around.

29:15.086 --> 29:18.088
- [knocking at door]

29:22.385 --> 29:24.261
- Oh, my God, Paige,
what happened?

29:24.387 --> 29:26.805
- l fell over in the park.

29:26.931 --> 29:28.140
- That looks bad.

29:28.266 --> 29:31.852
- No, it's really not.

29:31.978 --> 29:33.812
- Oh.

29:33.938 --> 29:36.523
Sit down over there.

29:36.649 --> 29:38.442
Right here.

29:41.404 --> 29:42.654
Take this down.

29:42.781 --> 29:44.740
- Okay.

29:44.866 --> 29:48.786
- My dear Alfreda,

29:48.912 --> 29:55.501
it was a great pleasure
to see you on Wednesday.

29:55.627 --> 29:58.962
After further consideration...

30:01.883 --> 30:04.718
Can you bend it?

30:04.844 --> 30:06.845
- [sighs]

30:06.971 --> 30:08.931
- Does it hurt?

30:09.057 --> 30:11.517
- I mean, yeah,
it hurts a little bit.

30:11.643 --> 30:14.186
- Where?

30:14.312 --> 30:15.687
- Just on this side.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.731
- Uh-huh.

30:17.857 --> 30:21.360
l've got some cream.

30:21.486 --> 30:22.778
My doctor prescribed it to me

30:22.904 --> 30:26.240
when l fell down those steps
at Christie's.

30:26.366 --> 30:28.075
Dear Lord.

30:28.201 --> 30:30.744
My, oh, my.

30:30.870 --> 30:32.788
Oh, it was embarrassing.

30:32.914 --> 30:36.416
l pretended as if
nothing had happened,

30:36.543 --> 30:39.795
but the pain, the pain!

30:39.921 --> 30:41.880
There you go.

30:42.006 --> 30:45.551
Okay.

30:45.677 --> 30:47.177
Take this down.

30:47.303 --> 30:48.720
After further consideration,

30:48.847 --> 30:53.851
we think that 20 million
would be a fair valuation

30:53.977 --> 30:55.435
for the painting

30:55.562 --> 31:02.526
and of course
help facilitate the sale.

31:02.652 --> 31:04.486
- You know what, Art?
I can do this.

31:04.612 --> 31:07.656
It's fine.
Honestly, l can-

31:07.782 --> 31:09.283
ln a few minutes,
you won't feel a thing.

31:09.409 --> 31:11.076
- Art, Art-
oh, Art.

31:11.202 --> 31:12.160
Excuse me.
- Yes?

31:12.287 --> 31:13.662
- The Havermeyers
are in the gallery.

31:13.788 --> 31:15.664
- Okay.

31:17.375 --> 31:19.251
- "l'm interested in how sight,

31:19.377 --> 31:21.712
"which is limited
by our biological makeup,

31:21.838 --> 31:23.505
"affects observation
of what's around us,

31:23.631 --> 31:26.758
"and therefore limits perception

"I Iike to expIore
these boundaries

31:28.386 --> 31:29.678
and through my work exp"-

31:29.846 --> 31:30.929
Oh, fuck work.

31:31.055 --> 31:34.057
[knocking at door]

31:37.270 --> 31:38.437
[buzzing]

31:47.238 --> 31:48.155
- Hi, Jean.

31:48.281 --> 31:49.197
- Jo.

31:49.324 --> 31:50.324
- You found it.

31:50.450 --> 31:52.242
- Hello.

31:52.368 --> 31:54.745
l brought Picasso.
l hope you don't mind.

31:54.871 --> 31:55.996
- Of course not.
Hey, Picasso.

31:56.122 --> 31:57.331
- He won't be a bother,
l promise.

31:57.457 --> 31:58.540
Sit, sit.

31:58.666 --> 32:00.167
- Come in.

32:00.293 --> 32:03.420
- Wow.

32:03.546 --> 32:07.007
- Oh, here,
let me take your coat.

32:07.133 --> 32:08.926
- Wow.

32:09.052 --> 32:12.262
So this is where you work.

32:12.388 --> 32:14.389
- Yeah, this is it.

32:14.515 --> 32:16.725
Well, the show has to do
with peripheral vision.

32:16.851 --> 32:17.935
- Right.

32:18.061 --> 32:19.728
- l'm interested in
how one's sight

32:19.854 --> 32:21.855
is limited
to our biological makeup.

32:21.981 --> 32:24.274
l want to explore
the boundaries which-

32:24.400 --> 32:27.527
you know, which define
what we can and can't perceive.

32:27.654 --> 32:28.612
- Wow.

32:28.738 --> 32:30.781
lt's interesting.

32:30.907 --> 32:32.407
- l conceived the show
when I was, um,

32:32.533 --> 32:34.159
l was walking across Park Lane,

32:34.285 --> 32:36.745
and this crazy guy in a van
aImost ran me over.

32:36.871 --> 32:37.871
- No.

32:37.997 --> 32:39.498
- You know, itjust got me
thinking, like,

32:39.624 --> 32:40.832
how we see and ascertain
an object

32:40.959 --> 32:42.167
purely by what's in front of us

32:42.293 --> 32:46.004
rather than taking into account
our peripheraI vision.

32:46.130 --> 32:47.047
- Right.

32:47.173 --> 32:48.382
- l'm going on.

32:48.508 --> 32:49.508
- No, no, no.

32:49.634 --> 32:53.720
It's very, very,
very interesting.

32:53.846 --> 32:57.641
- Now, this is a device
I'm constructing.

32:57.767 --> 33:01.395
lf you just come forward
and put your head here.

33:01.521 --> 33:04.231
- Just-just here?

33:04.357 --> 33:07.901
- See, and then keep your eye
on the object in front.

33:08.027 --> 33:12.864
And take hoId of
these two levers.

33:12.991 --> 33:14.408
- [laughs]

33:14.534 --> 33:19.496
- And slowly.

33:19.622 --> 33:22.207
You only become aware
of the predators-

33:22.333 --> 33:23.250
- Ooh!

33:23.376 --> 33:26.753
[laughter]

33:27.422 --> 33:28.463
- Good God, Art.

33:28.589 --> 33:31.466
lt's outperforming the FTSE,
and that's 20% in a week.

33:31.592 --> 33:33.677
- [laughs]

33:33.803 --> 33:34.761
- No, yeah.

33:34.887 --> 33:36.430
Uh-huh.

33:36.556 --> 33:37.514
Well, l'll think about it.

33:37.640 --> 33:38.807
Okay.
- Bye-bye.

33:38.933 --> 33:41.226
- Bye.

33:41.352 --> 33:43.395
Spindle is outrageous.

33:43.521 --> 33:45.814
He says they want
24 miIIion.

33:45.940 --> 33:48.483
- Well, that's 16 for them
and 8 commission for Art.

33:48.609 --> 33:50.027
- Oh.

33:50.153 --> 33:52.904
- But the old man doesn't even
want to seII the picture.

33:53.031 --> 33:54.740
- So what's he on about?

33:54.866 --> 33:56.199
- Well, they're gonna
have to sell.

33:56.325 --> 33:58.368
He's just trying to find
their breaking point.

33:58.494 --> 34:00.912
- Any way we can help them?

34:01.039 --> 34:05.417
- We could go to them direct
and offer 18 million.

34:05.543 --> 34:06.585
- Hmm.

34:06.711 --> 34:09.838
So are you going behind
the back of Art SpindIe?

34:09.964 --> 34:11.757
- l'm leaving the gallery,
right?

34:11.882 --> 34:13.550
- [laughs]

34:13.676 --> 34:15.052
- Now you're gonna have to put
your head

34:15.178 --> 34:16.511
inside this little hole.

34:16.637 --> 34:17.554
- Really?

34:17.679 --> 34:19.181
- ln you go.
- Okay.

34:26.898 --> 34:28.273
- To the left and right of you,

34:28.399 --> 34:30.400
you have a nonfunctional
domestic environment.

34:30.525 --> 34:32.277
- Yes.

34:32.402 --> 34:33.737
- Yeah, see,
if you turn to the left,

34:33.862 --> 34:35.781
you're only aware
of that object, right?

34:35.907 --> 34:41.578
Now, if you turn to your right.

34:41.704 --> 34:45.415
See, you only are aware of those
one object in front of you.

34:45.541 --> 34:46.458
- Right.

34:46.583 --> 34:47.918
- But if you stare
straight ahead...

34:48.043 --> 34:49.085
- Yeah.

34:49.212 --> 34:52.297
- You suddenly become aware
of everything.

34:52.422 --> 34:53.547
- Yes.

34:53.674 --> 34:57.594
- Have you ever actually used
a Chapman?

34:57.720 --> 34:58.637
- No.

34:58.763 --> 35:02.015
[giggles]

35:02.141 --> 35:06.269
- l mean, just for fun.

35:06.395 --> 35:07.646
- You're so silly.

35:07.772 --> 35:08.647
- Uh-huh.

35:08.773 --> 35:11.233
[lmitates machine gun]

35:13.611 --> 35:16.488
- Oh, you're not supposed
to do that.

35:16.614 --> 35:19.407
Maybe we should end this.

35:22.453 --> 35:23.954
- Why?

35:24.080 --> 35:26.164
- WeII, we're gonna have
a professional relationship.

35:26.290 --> 35:28.500
So maybe we
should keep it that way.

35:28.626 --> 35:32.629
- WeII, if I had thought
being your sleeping partner

35:32.755 --> 35:34.172
would mean
not sleeping with you,

35:34.298 --> 35:37.217
l wouldn't have got that gallery
in the first pIace, wouId I?

35:37.343 --> 35:39.094
- Come on, Bob.

35:39.220 --> 35:41.471
18 million.

35:41.597 --> 35:42.889
What's my commission?

35:43.015 --> 35:44.850
- Oh, let's see.

35:47.478 --> 35:50.480
- [gasping and moaning]

36:03.744 --> 36:05.829
- [growling]

36:15.756 --> 36:16.715
- [sighs]

36:16.841 --> 36:18.133
How long have you
been here, Beth?

36:18.259 --> 36:19.968
- About five years.

36:20.094 --> 36:21.553
- l've paid you well.

36:21.679 --> 36:23.471
Hmm?

36:23.598 --> 36:25.807
l have made you a director
of the gaIIery.

36:25.933 --> 36:30.353
l've introduced you to some of
the greatest artists of the day

36:30.479 --> 36:33.148
and some of the most infiuential
coIIectors in our time.

36:33.274 --> 36:34.316
[laughs]

36:34.442 --> 36:36.526
And this?

36:36.652 --> 36:40.238
This is how you repay me?

36:40.364 --> 36:43.200
Why?

36:43.326 --> 36:46.328
- I want to start
my own gallery.

36:46.454 --> 36:50.415
- Do you know how many times
l've heard that shit?

36:50.541 --> 36:54.044
If I hear that you
have feathered your nest

36:54.170 --> 36:55.086
with my client list...

36:55.213 --> 36:56.338
- [scoffs]

36:56.464 --> 37:01.343
- l will make life
extremely difficult for you.

37:01.469 --> 37:02.677
- [scoffs]

37:02.803 --> 37:04.554
But I'm onIy doing
what you would be doing, Art,

37:04.680 --> 37:06.973
if you were in my position.

37:07.099 --> 37:12.771
- This...is betrayal.

37:12.897 --> 37:17.901
- I just want to have my own
space showlng young artists.

37:18.027 --> 37:21.238
- Get out.

37:21.364 --> 37:23.114
Get out!

37:31.832 --> 37:33.792
- [sighs]

37:33.918 --> 37:35.752
[giggles]

37:35.878 --> 37:41.174
- Paige, get me accounts.

37:41.300 --> 37:42.259
Hi.

37:42.385 --> 37:44.052
[laughs]

37:44.178 --> 37:46.388
l want you to stop
aII commissions

37:46.514 --> 37:48.306
due to Beth Freemantle.

37:48.432 --> 37:51.851
l want a full audit
of her expense account.

37:51.978 --> 37:56.398
l want her password blocked
from the database,

37:56.524 --> 38:00.318
and l want her mobile phone
terminated.

38:00.444 --> 38:03.363
Thank you.

38:03.489 --> 38:05.282
That little bitch.

38:14.583 --> 38:18.586
[glass clinking]

38:18.713 --> 38:20.422
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you.

38:20.548 --> 38:22.924
Thank you for coming tonight.

38:23.050 --> 38:25.677
You know,
l thought of this show

38:25.803 --> 38:29.347
a good five years ago.

38:29.473 --> 38:31.683
And l hope
you will agree with me

38:31.809 --> 38:33.476
that the result is quite...

38:33.602 --> 38:35.103
[laughs]

38:35.229 --> 38:36.688
Spectacular.

38:36.814 --> 38:38.606
[applause]

38:38.733 --> 38:43.236
I'd Iike to thank everybody
who has worked at the gallery

38:43.362 --> 38:48.325
so tireIessIy, tireIessIy,
to make this exhibition happen.

38:48.451 --> 38:53.079
l'd also like to take this
opportunity to bid farewell to-

38:53.205 --> 38:57.042
regretfully bid farewell
to one of our gallery directors

38:57.168 --> 39:00.920
that has been
at my side these five years

39:01.047 --> 39:07.093
and without whose help this show
would not have been possible.

39:07.219 --> 39:13.141
Please raise your glasses
to Beth FreemantIe.

39:13.267 --> 39:15.310
all: To Beth.

39:15.436 --> 39:18.646
[laughter]

39:18.773 --> 39:20.482
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

39:20.608 --> 39:23.610
[applause]

39:32.661 --> 39:34.662
- That was really great.

39:34.789 --> 39:37.791
That was very, very moving, Art.

39:37.917 --> 39:38.833
Very moving.

39:38.959 --> 39:41.544
- And it didn't work.

39:41.670 --> 39:44.172
So he-
three tries.

39:44.298 --> 39:45.799
When he figured out
he couldn't sue me,

39:45.925 --> 39:46.841
he sued the artist.

39:46.967 --> 39:48.009
l told the judge,

39:48.135 --> 39:49.761
"Hey, art doesn't come
with a guarantee."

39:49.887 --> 39:51.388
[laughs]

39:51.514 --> 39:52.722
ln my humble opinion,

39:52.848 --> 39:53.932
Schneider is shit.

39:54.058 --> 39:55.183
[laughs]

39:55.309 --> 39:58.228
[laughter]

39:58.354 --> 40:02.565
- What's the dog walker
doing here?

40:02.691 --> 40:05.026
- Yeah, he tried
to sell me some concept.

40:05.152 --> 40:06.069
My dog walker.

40:06.195 --> 40:07.070
- Your dog walker?

40:07.196 --> 40:08.113
- Yes, my dog walker.

40:08.239 --> 40:09.280
- Your dog walker?

40:09.407 --> 40:10.323
Shit.

40:10.449 --> 40:11.366
- Beth.

40:11.492 --> 40:13.535
- Hey.
Hey.

40:13.661 --> 40:15.120
- Yeah, oh, l'd love see that.

40:15.246 --> 40:16.162
- Hi, Jean.

40:16.288 --> 40:17.497
- Oh, hi, honey.

40:17.623 --> 40:18.665
l'd love to see it.

40:19.959 --> 40:22.252
[laughter]

40:22.378 --> 40:24.129
- Well, it's more-
- l told you.

40:24.255 --> 40:26.131
Bob, l told you about it.
We taIked about it.

40:26.257 --> 40:27.590
- No, but that sounds-

40:27.716 --> 40:29.426
- He's just-he's had
a bit too much to drink.

40:29.552 --> 40:31.094
- [sniffing]

40:31.220 --> 40:35.014
Oh.

40:35.141 --> 40:39.269
- [sniffing]

40:39.395 --> 40:40.562
[laughs]

40:40.688 --> 40:44.858
Wait.

40:44.984 --> 40:46.317
[laughter]

40:46.444 --> 40:48.611
- Oh, she's your girlfriend,
right?

40:48.737 --> 40:50.447
- Yeah.

40:50.573 --> 40:52.991
Well, if you want, you could
come see the work sometime.

40:53.117 --> 40:55.660
- Oh, l mean, l'll see it
at the gallery, right, you know?

40:55.786 --> 40:57.078
- Yeah, but, l don't know.

40:57.204 --> 40:58.580
It wouId be nice
to get your opinion,

40:58.706 --> 40:59.664
see what you think of it.

40:59.790 --> 41:00.707
- Really?

41:00.833 --> 41:02.250
- Hello, Jo.

41:02.376 --> 41:03.418
- Jean, hey.

41:03.544 --> 41:04.377
- Hi.

41:04.503 --> 41:07.464
- Do you guys know each other?

41:08.632 --> 41:10.467
- I just-
l just had a question.

41:10.593 --> 41:11.926
l had an idea, actually.

41:12.052 --> 41:12.969
- Oh, okay, sure.

41:13.095 --> 41:15.096
Can l just take a seat?
- Yeah.

41:15.222 --> 41:16.431
Oh, I got it.
- No, it's all right.

41:16.557 --> 41:17.557
l've got it.
l've got it.

41:17.683 --> 41:19.809
- You all right?
- Yes.

41:19.935 --> 41:23.104
l just had an idea that maybe,

41:23.230 --> 41:25.690
maybe we couId go
somewhere together.

41:25.816 --> 41:27.734
- Oh, honey, I think
it's a little difficult-

41:27.860 --> 41:29.569
- No, no, no.

41:29.695 --> 41:31.237
l mean like New York.

41:31.363 --> 41:33.573
Maybe we can go
to New York together.

41:33.699 --> 41:35.450
- Yeah, um-

41:35.576 --> 41:37.118
- Oh, come on, Jo.
- I don't know.

41:37.244 --> 41:40.246
- I'II introduce you
to people like, you know,

41:40.372 --> 41:43.833
like Marks and Larry

41:43.959 --> 41:45.752
and Andrea
and all these wonderful-

41:45.878 --> 41:47.086
- Jean, Jean, everybody's here.

41:47.213 --> 41:48.796
- l know.

41:48.923 --> 41:50.006
There's my husband.

41:50.132 --> 41:51.174
[laughter]

41:51.300 --> 41:53.259
Let's go to the bathroom.

41:53.385 --> 41:55.136
- l don't think we should.
- No, come on.

41:55.262 --> 41:56.304
l haven't done that in ages.

41:56.430 --> 41:57.430
- No, l don't think we should.

41:57.556 --> 41:58.473
- Come on, let's go, okay?

41:58.599 --> 41:59.807
Oh, shh.

42:04.021 --> 42:06.439
- And as we were leaving,
we ran into lvor Schneider.

42:08.442 --> 42:10.318
So this girI, she can't
have been any older than 16.

42:10.444 --> 42:11.819
ln fact,
l think she was a lot younger.

42:11.946 --> 42:13.655
[laughter]

42:13.781 --> 42:16.241
And as we were talking,
l had this really good idea.

42:16.367 --> 42:18.660
- Yeah, so we'II do
a 50-50 split after cost.

42:18.786 --> 42:20.912
lf you need any money
to finish your show,

42:21.038 --> 42:22.330
then l will finance you.

42:22.456 --> 42:24.499
- l really don't know
what to say.

42:24.625 --> 42:25.542
Great.

42:25.668 --> 42:27.502
Amazing.

42:27.628 --> 42:29.337
l mean, l can't wait
to teII Dewey.

42:29.463 --> 42:30.838
- Oh, yeah,
what's your relationship

42:30.965 --> 42:31.881
with him, by the way?

42:32.007 --> 42:33.132
You said
he represents you?

42:33.259 --> 42:35.593
- Well, he's kind of been
helping me out.

42:35.719 --> 42:37.887
- Oh, yeah.
l mean, l really like him.

42:38.013 --> 42:40.306
But l mean, l couldn't have him
in the middIe.

42:40.432 --> 42:42.684
l mean, l hate to say this
about him, 'cause he's a friend.

42:42.810 --> 42:44.060
l really love him,
but, you know,

42:44.186 --> 42:46.104
he has a credibility issue.

42:46.230 --> 42:48.565
- Yeah.

42:48.691 --> 42:51.651
Um, well, l can talk to him.

42:51.777 --> 42:53.403
Give him a piece of work
or something.

42:53.529 --> 42:54.571
He'll be fine.

42:54.697 --> 42:57.073
[people shouting]

42:57.199 --> 42:58.449
Oh, speak of the devil.

42:58.576 --> 42:59.492

43:14.758 --> 43:16.050
[laughter]

43:16.176 --> 43:17.385
- Have you seen Jo?

43:17.511 --> 43:18.886
- Mm.

43:19.013 --> 43:20.346
He was taIking

43:20.472 --> 43:21.764
a wee while ago.

43:21.890 --> 43:24.267
- [gasping and moaning]

43:24.393 --> 43:27.270
- Jo, you will come with me
to New York, won't you?

43:27.396 --> 43:29.272
- Yeah, yeah, don't stop.

43:29.398 --> 43:30.481
- Oh, she's so funny sometimes.

43:30.608 --> 43:31.649
- Yeah.

43:33.402 --> 43:34.652
- Oh, hey, Bob.

43:34.778 --> 43:35.653
- Hey, hey, Dewey.

43:35.779 --> 43:37.780
- [gasps]

43:48.917 --> 43:51.002
- [chuckles quietly]

43:51.128 --> 43:54.130
- [laughs]

44:15.569 --> 44:17.654
- Bob, l want a divorce.

44:28.874 --> 44:30.583
- Well, Jean,

44:30.709 --> 44:32.752
if that's what you want.

44:37.091 --> 44:40.259
- Just like that?

44:40.386 --> 44:45.848
l mean, how many years, Bob?

44:45.974 --> 44:49.519
How many years
have we been married?

44:49.645 --> 44:53.481
- Um, 1987.

44:53.607 --> 44:54.816
That makes-

44:54.942 --> 45:00.488
- '86.

45:00.614 --> 45:01.948
- No, l think it was '87, Jean.

45:02.074 --> 45:04.325
- Oh, my God.

45:04.451 --> 45:06.703
'86, Bob.

45:06.829 --> 45:09.205
At Ricky Robenstein's
birthday party.

45:09.331 --> 45:11.582
- But that was '87.

45:11.709 --> 45:14.544
The next week we fiew
to Warhol's funeral.

45:14.670 --> 45:18.256
- Warhol's funeral
was 1986, Bob.

45:18.382 --> 45:19.757
- Eighty-fucking-seven.

45:19.883 --> 45:22.218
It was the same year
l had my appendix out.

45:22.344 --> 45:25.888
- The appendix was 1988,

45:26.014 --> 45:27.890
two years after met.

45:28.016 --> 45:29.642
l remember it as if it was
just the other day.

45:29.768 --> 45:31.769
- lt was my appendix,
God damn it.

45:31.895 --> 45:35.356
- l met you in '86.

45:35.482 --> 45:37.233
- Fuck.

45:37.359 --> 45:38.276
- Fuck!

45:38.402 --> 45:41.487
Yes, that's all you knew
how to do.

45:44.366 --> 45:46.451
- What are you doing?

45:46.577 --> 45:50.079
- What does it look like
I'm doing?

45:50.205 --> 45:52.081
- Where you gonna go, Art's?

45:52.207 --> 45:53.416
- What are you insinuating?

45:53.542 --> 45:55.793
- You guys seem
to like each other.

45:55.919 --> 45:57.837
- We're just friends.

45:57.963 --> 45:59.797
- He's gay, anyway.

46:01.175 --> 46:03.092
- He is not gay.

46:03.218 --> 46:07.096
- Nice shoes.

46:11.769 --> 46:14.187
[laughs]

46:17.149 --> 46:19.984
[buzzing]

46:20.110 --> 46:22.153
- [groaning]

46:22.279 --> 46:23.905
What the fuck?

46:24.031 --> 46:26.783
[buzzing continues]

46:26.909 --> 46:28.326
Hello?

46:28.452 --> 46:29.660
Who?

46:29.787 --> 46:32.622
Jean Maclestone?

46:32.748 --> 46:33.831
Fuck.

46:33.957 --> 46:36.501
Don't make a sound.

46:36.627 --> 46:39.295
[breathing deeply]

46:39.421 --> 46:42.131
Shit.

46:42.257 --> 46:43.341
[elevator bell dings]

46:47.930 --> 46:49.555
- l just walked out on Bob.

46:49.681 --> 46:50.848
- You just walked out on Bob?

46:50.974 --> 46:51.974
lsn't that a bit extreme?

46:52.100 --> 46:54.060
- l'm going for a divorce.

46:54.186 --> 46:55.061
- Divorce?

46:55.187 --> 46:57.814
- l've had enough, Art.

46:57.940 --> 47:00.942
Oh, God.

47:01.068 --> 47:03.027
I don't want to be
kicked out on my arse

47:03.153 --> 47:05.029
when it's all too late,
you know?

47:06.532 --> 47:08.574
l don't want to be left

47:08.700 --> 47:10.076
when l'm old and cranky

47:10.202 --> 47:11.702
and look like the butt end
of a rhino.

47:11.829 --> 47:12.745
You know what l mean?

47:12.871 --> 47:14.997
l mean, l don't-

47:15.123 --> 47:18.793
I don't want to stagnate
in some Notting Hill mansion

47:18.919 --> 47:20.795
watching him screw secretaries,

47:20.921 --> 47:23.214
and then one day
when it suits him,

47:23.340 --> 47:25.633
leave me and marry one of them.

47:28.887 --> 47:31.347
Art, I'm not gonna
talk about this right now.

47:32.599 --> 47:33.683
l'm just tired.

47:33.809 --> 47:37.812
l'm tired of 20 years
of marriage.

47:40.232 --> 47:43.609
20, 20.

47:43.735 --> 47:45.820
l don't think you know
what it's been like.

47:45.946 --> 47:48.865
[glass shattering]

47:48.991 --> 47:53.160
- That's my cat.

47:53.287 --> 47:55.955
- [gasps]

47:56.081 --> 47:58.749
l want to live, Art.

47:58.876 --> 48:02.336
l want to go to bars.

48:02.462 --> 48:04.881
l want to go to Rio and Moscow

48:05.007 --> 48:08.175
and Cambodia.

48:08.302 --> 48:10.636
l want my own place.

48:10.762 --> 48:13.764
l want my own friends.

48:13.891 --> 48:16.559
l want to stay up all night.

48:16.685 --> 48:19.228
Oh, God.

48:19.354 --> 48:23.232
I don't want to hear
about the next property deal

48:23.358 --> 48:28.404
or, God, the Arsenal score
or Matisse's coiffure

48:28.530 --> 48:32.450
or have, oh, long discussions
about how he met Warhol

48:32.576 --> 48:33.910
or how many inches of space

48:34.036 --> 48:36.245
the Basquiat
should have around it!

48:36.371 --> 48:37.997
God.

48:38.123 --> 48:39.916
You know what l mean?

48:44.046 --> 48:49.091
l've had enough.

48:49.217 --> 48:54.180
l guess we've just grown apart.

48:54.306 --> 48:55.306
[sighs]

48:55.432 --> 48:57.516
- Jean.

48:57.643 --> 49:01.979
- We have got nothing in common

49:02.105 --> 49:07.360
except a taste
for collecting art.

49:07.486 --> 49:08.527
- Jean.

49:31.301 --> 49:34.303
[train rumbling]

49:37.516 --> 49:41.686
- Last night I met this
totally hot, totally cute guy.

49:41.812 --> 49:42.728
And guess what.

49:42.854 --> 49:43.896
He was smart as well.

49:44.022 --> 49:45.022
l mean, can you imagine?

49:45.148 --> 49:46.399
[laughs]

49:46.525 --> 49:49.193
l told him all about our show,
and he was so into it,

49:49.319 --> 49:50.861
and he totally got your work.

49:50.988 --> 49:55.157
lt was just amazing.

49:55.283 --> 49:57.827
[giggles]

49:57.953 --> 49:59.078
- l got you something, Dewey.

49:59.204 --> 50:02.164
- Ooh.

50:04.376 --> 50:06.919
Oh, my God.

50:07.045 --> 50:11.132
Elaine, this is my favorite one.

50:11.258 --> 50:14.427
Oh, l've got the perfect frame
for that.

50:14.553 --> 50:15.845
Wow, l can't believe it.

50:15.971 --> 50:17.304
Thanks, darling.

50:17.431 --> 50:19.765
- lt's for all the support
you've been giving me.

50:19.891 --> 50:22.601
- Oh, you didn't need
to do that, though.

50:22.728 --> 50:24.979
Wow.

50:25.105 --> 50:29.442
- We need to talk about
our working relationship.

50:29.568 --> 50:32.528
And...

50:32.654 --> 50:36.449
- Okay.

50:36.575 --> 50:39.201
- You know how you're involved
in my work and stuff.

50:39.327 --> 50:43.289
- Yeah, what do you mean,
EIaine?

50:43.415 --> 50:46.417
- Beth wants to deal with me
directIy.

50:52.049 --> 50:54.175
- Well, where does that
Ieave me?

51:01.850 --> 51:02.850
l see.

51:04.603 --> 51:06.270
- Dewey, Dewey, come on.

51:06.396 --> 51:07.313
This is the art world.

51:07.439 --> 51:09.065
This is how it works.

51:09.191 --> 51:10.107
Dewey!

51:10.233 --> 51:12.693
[door slams]

51:12.819 --> 51:15.529
Shit.

51:18.075 --> 51:19.867
- So this is where you work,
right?

51:19.993 --> 51:21.368
- Yeah, this is it.

51:21.495 --> 51:23.579
l kind of sit at my desk,
Iook out the window,

51:23.705 --> 51:25.873
and wait for an idea to hit me,
you know?

51:25.999 --> 51:27.750
- Wow, you don't even
have to get out of bed.

51:27.876 --> 51:29.418
- No.

51:29.544 --> 51:31.921
And sometimes l like
to do drawings,

51:32.047 --> 51:34.757
kind of like a p-p-pre-pa-
oh, f-

51:34.883 --> 51:36.217
- Preparatory?

51:36.343 --> 51:38.302
- l can never fucking pronounce
that word.

51:38.428 --> 51:39.428
Do you want to see some?

51:39.554 --> 51:41.347
- You mean some
preparatory sketches?

51:41.473 --> 51:43.182
- [chuckles]

51:43.308 --> 51:46.185
Yeah, this is what
l'm working on at the moment.

51:46.311 --> 51:51.857
[erratic piano music]

51:51.983 --> 51:53.526
Oh, that's Podrazik.

51:53.652 --> 51:57.488
- Oh, right.

51:57.614 --> 51:59.281
- Oh, now, this is a piece.

51:59.407 --> 52:01.242
You see, it's to do
with peripheral vision.

52:01.368 --> 52:03.119
lt's gonna be an installation.

52:03.245 --> 52:05.788
And you walk in here,

52:05.914 --> 52:07.832
and you place your head
in this device,

52:07.958 --> 52:10.960
see, so that
it can't move around.

52:12.420 --> 52:13.504
So then to your left and right

52:13.630 --> 52:15.422
you have a nonfunctional
domestic environment,

52:15.549 --> 52:17.758
part of, but not the whole
of which, you can see.

52:17.884 --> 52:20.636
- You mean you can't see
aII of it at the same time.

52:20.762 --> 52:22.304
- No, you can only see
certain objects.

52:22.430 --> 52:23.764
But then if you look
directIy at me,

52:23.890 --> 52:25.724
you suddenly become aware
of everything, right?

52:25.851 --> 52:27.810
- Yeah.

52:27.936 --> 52:29.061
That's-wow.

52:29.187 --> 52:31.564
Yeah, that's really cool.

52:31.690 --> 52:36.068
- It kind of brings you
into this new vision, you know?

52:36.194 --> 52:38.112
- lt kind of questions reality.

52:40.365 --> 52:42.158
l thought you were with Beth.

52:43.827 --> 52:46.036
- Yeah.

52:46.163 --> 52:47.913
- We should keep this
strictIy professionaI.

52:48.039 --> 52:49.039
Don't you think, Jo?

52:50.208 --> 52:52.585
- [scoffs]

52:52.711 --> 52:54.003
Yeah, sure.

53:01.094 --> 53:02.261
- Tell me, Freign.

53:02.387 --> 53:04.138
l don't want to be indiscreet,
but do you think

53:04.264 --> 53:06.182
they may eventually decide
on selling the Mondrian?

53:06.308 --> 53:08.225
- l think a little more
persuasion will be required.

53:08.351 --> 53:09.393
- You mean a higher price.

53:09.519 --> 53:12.271
- lnsurance is a matter
of great concern.

53:12.397 --> 53:14.356
- l'll pay for the insurance.
How about that?

53:14.482 --> 53:16.442
- That's most generous.

53:16.568 --> 53:18.819
l will raise my offer
to, say, 25 million,

53:18.945 --> 53:20.946
and l suggest that we insure it
for 40 miIIion.

53:21.072 --> 53:22.281
What do you think?

53:22.407 --> 53:23.407
- l think that would be

53:23.533 --> 53:27.912
a most appropriate sum,
Mr. SpindIe.

53:28.038 --> 53:29.997
One of mine, l'm afraid.

53:37.547 --> 53:38.505
- Robert Freign.

53:38.632 --> 53:39.673
Huh.

53:39.799 --> 53:41.383
I didn't know
that you were an artist.

53:41.509 --> 53:43.594
- An amateur rock painter.

53:43.720 --> 53:46.222
A grey marI
from Aix-en-Provence.

53:46.348 --> 53:50.684
Cezanne painted 27 canvases
from Bibemus quarry,

53:50.810 --> 53:52.436
where this particular stone
was found.

53:52.562 --> 53:54.730
- Ah.
Fascinating.

53:54.856 --> 53:55.981
Fascinating.

53:56.107 --> 53:57.274
- Please have it.

53:57.400 --> 53:58.734
- Oh, no, l couldn't.

53:58.860 --> 54:00.069
- No, please.

54:00.195 --> 54:03.072
- Why, thank you.

54:04.407 --> 54:05.908
[laughs]

54:06.034 --> 54:08.577
Perhaps we should do a show.

54:08.703 --> 54:10.412
- You fiatter me, Mr. Spindle.

54:10.538 --> 54:12.706
- Not at all,
not at all.

54:19.881 --> 54:21.257
- l hope you got the Picasso
out of him.

54:21.383 --> 54:24.009
- They're working on it.

54:24.135 --> 54:28.055
- Jean, don't let the lawyers
fob you off with pIatitudes.

54:28.181 --> 54:29.306
Be demanding.

54:29.432 --> 54:33.018
Make sure you get copies
of aII correspondence.

54:33.144 --> 54:34.812
Read them like your life
depended on it.

54:34.938 --> 54:37.106
You onIy get one
good shot at this.

54:37.232 --> 54:38.983
Okay, honey?

54:39.109 --> 54:41.735
- Right.

54:41.861 --> 54:45.322
- So what's the damage?

54:45.448 --> 54:46.740
- Okay, Bob.

54:46.866 --> 54:51.078
Let's start with Notting Hill,
Tuscany, Palm Beach,

54:51.204 --> 54:52.329
wrap up with Aspen.

54:52.455 --> 54:54.540
- What about Aspen?

54:54.666 --> 54:57.042
- l get the house,
and he gets the art.

54:57.168 --> 54:59.003
- You sure that's wise, Jean?

54:59.129 --> 55:01.005
Art is exceeding property prices
two to one.

55:01.131 --> 55:02.589
- Do you think
l should renegotiate?

55:02.716 --> 55:03.674
- Of course you should.

55:03.800 --> 55:06.218
Being tough over this

55:06.344 --> 55:09.305
creates opportunities
down the line.

55:09.431 --> 55:10.681
- How so?

55:10.807 --> 55:14.101
- Oh, it gives you room
to appear reasonable later on

55:14.227 --> 55:15.394
over other issues.

55:15.520 --> 55:16.895
lf you have to compromise,

55:17.022 --> 55:18.856
at least you fall back
on a position

55:18.982 --> 55:20.816
you already agreed on.

55:20.942 --> 55:21.900
- Right.

55:22.027 --> 55:24.278
- What about the Smith
in the garden?

55:24.404 --> 55:27.197
- That's his.

55:27.324 --> 55:28.490
- And the Kelly?

55:28.616 --> 55:29.908
- That's mine.

55:30.035 --> 55:30.993
- The Judd,

55:31.119 --> 55:32.786
the Flavin,

55:32.912 --> 55:35.289
the Brancusi.

55:35.415 --> 55:36.999
- She wants the Brancush?

55:37.125 --> 55:38.042
- Mm-hmm.

55:38.168 --> 55:39.460
- Brancusi?

55:39.586 --> 55:40.961
- Brancush.

55:41.087 --> 55:42.171
- Brancush?

55:42.297 --> 55:44.256
- She hates the Brancush.

55:44.382 --> 55:45.799
She didn't want me to buy it.

55:45.925 --> 55:48.635
She even hangs her coat
off of it.

55:48.762 --> 55:50.679
Why the hell would she want
the Brancush?

55:50.805 --> 55:52.264
- lt's worth a fortune.

55:52.390 --> 55:53.515
l had Art look into it.

55:53.641 --> 55:56.226
He thinks Bob's
completely underpriced it.

55:56.353 --> 55:57.561
- That's my girl.

55:57.687 --> 56:01.815
- The WarhoI, the Beuys,
the Hockney in the hallway.

56:01.941 --> 56:03.400
- Magritte?
- That's his.

56:03.526 --> 56:05.527
- Never liked that one anyway.
- No.

56:05.653 --> 56:09.740
- The Struth photographs
in the first-floor bathroom.

56:09.866 --> 56:11.033
- Good God.

56:11.159 --> 56:12.326
- Giacometti?

56:12.452 --> 56:13.494
- That's his.

56:13.620 --> 56:15.329
- Oh, pity.
- Yeah.

56:15.455 --> 56:16.914
But l get the Lucas

56:17.040 --> 56:19.750
and the Judd stack piece
in the haII.

56:19.876 --> 56:21.418
- The Katz cutouts
on the stairs,

56:21.544 --> 56:24.380
the Mapplethorpe photographs
on the Ianding,

56:24.506 --> 56:29.009
the Bacon in the living room,
the Emin, the Currin,

56:29.135 --> 56:31.929
the Landy,
and the Jew in the library.

56:32.055 --> 56:36.266
- l get the Hirst, the Rusche,
and the Barney suite.

56:36.393 --> 56:38.060
- [chuckles]

56:38.186 --> 56:39.395
- Shall we go in?

56:39.521 --> 56:41.397
- Yeah, l'm famished.

56:41.523 --> 56:43.273
- She aIso wants
the Dogan pieces

56:43.400 --> 56:45.526
as well as the Picasso
scuIpture,

56:45.652 --> 56:50.239
oh, and all the art books.

56:50.365 --> 56:52.741
[people chattering]

56:55.995 --> 56:57.079
- Can l have a macchiato,
pIease?

56:57.205 --> 56:58.747
- A macch-

56:58.873 --> 57:01.291
- Macch-i-a-to.

57:01.418 --> 57:03.794
- I don't think
that we have that.

57:03.920 --> 57:05.921
- Sweetheart, l come
every other day to the Westbury,

57:06.047 --> 57:09.091
and l have a macchiato
every other day.

57:09.217 --> 57:10.592
- Yes, but l don't think-

57:10.718 --> 57:12.094
- Get the maitre d'.

57:12.220 --> 57:13.595
- Yes.

57:13.721 --> 57:15.973
- What is that, Hungarian?

57:16.099 --> 57:17.433
- l think it's Polish.

57:19.144 --> 57:20.811
- Signora, l am sorry,

57:20.937 --> 57:22.479
but it's the waitress'
first day.

57:22.605 --> 57:24.064
And she doesn't understand.

57:24.190 --> 57:25.816
- Alphonse, l just wanted
a macchiato.

57:25.942 --> 57:27.443
- A macchiato.

57:27.569 --> 57:28.485
- Due.

57:28.611 --> 57:29.862
- Of course, signora.

57:33.199 --> 57:34.324
- So...

57:34.451 --> 57:37.411
what about the other thing?

57:40.081 --> 57:42.124
- l've never had it so good.

57:44.794 --> 57:48.714
l'm taking the boy
to New York tonight.

57:48.840 --> 57:50.132
- You're what?

57:50.258 --> 57:53.469
- New York, first class,

57:53.595 --> 57:55.345
Four Seasons.

57:55.472 --> 57:57.389
- Are you crazy?

57:57.515 --> 57:59.224
- What?

57:59.350 --> 58:02.811
- I've been divorced
three times, Jean, okay?

58:02.937 --> 58:05.230
With Carmen,
l made legal history.

58:05.356 --> 58:06.482
l know these men.

58:06.608 --> 58:09.276
They're obsessive,
greedy sons of bitches.

58:09.402 --> 58:11.236
Give them an inch,
and they'll take a mile.

58:11.362 --> 58:13.614
And if he finds out that you're
screwlng Jo Richards...

58:13.740 --> 58:14.865
- Emille.

58:14.991 --> 58:16.992
- He'll have your arse.

58:17.118 --> 58:19.953
At the end of it, all you'll
get is his poster collection

58:20.079 --> 58:21.663
and his grandmother's
Shabbat candIes.

58:21.789 --> 58:23.582
- [scoffs]

58:23.708 --> 58:24.917
[phone ringing]

58:25.043 --> 58:27.753
Shh.

58:27.879 --> 58:28.879
Hello?

58:29.005 --> 58:32.257
Yes, l can't talk right now.

58:32.383 --> 58:33.550
Okay.

58:33.676 --> 58:37.346
Speak later.

58:37.472 --> 58:38.972
- Who pays those bills?

58:39.098 --> 58:42.017
- The office takes care of it.

58:42.143 --> 58:43.185
[sighs]

58:45.605 --> 58:46.480
What?

58:46.606 --> 58:47.689
- Evidence.

58:47.815 --> 58:50.400
Evidence.

58:50.527 --> 58:52.361
You should be compiling
everything about him.

58:52.487 --> 58:53.654
- No.

58:53.780 --> 58:55.531
- l hear he likes
gaIIery girIs.

58:55.657 --> 58:56.823
- Stop it.

58:56.950 --> 58:57.991
- Ask around, Jean.

58:58.117 --> 59:00.452
Get addresses, facts, numbers.

59:00.578 --> 59:02.955
If he uses Jo,
you'll have all the ammo.

59:03.081 --> 59:04.373
- Right.

59:04.499 --> 59:08.710
- And above aII,
don't compromise.

59:08.836 --> 59:12.172
- And finally, she wants Picasso
and Matisse.

59:12.298 --> 59:14.466
- She wants Matisse?

59:14.592 --> 59:18.136
Matisse is my dog.
No way!

59:18.263 --> 59:21.515
No way!

59:21.641 --> 59:23.892
She can have Picasso
but not Matisse.

59:24.018 --> 59:25.352
- I thought you
didn't like Matisse.

59:25.478 --> 59:26.770
- l don't,
but Picasso would be

59:26.896 --> 59:29.106
absolutely desperate
without him.

59:29.232 --> 59:32.192
- [laughs]

59:34.737 --> 59:36.113
- Moving on to Tuscany.

59:36.239 --> 59:40.576
- Wait.

59:40.702 --> 59:42.077
What if l sold everything?

59:42.203 --> 59:44.204
- What?

59:44.330 --> 59:46.415
- lf l sold all the art,

59:46.541 --> 59:48.417
if I soId
the whole goddamn lot.

59:48.543 --> 59:50.377
- Well, she'd still get
the money.

59:50.503 --> 59:53.547
What's the difference?

59:55.008 --> 59:57.009
- Well, the difference is that

59:57.135 --> 01:00:00.721
the money doesn't mean
a goddamn thing.

01:00:02.557 --> 01:00:07.185
- 28 million.

01:00:24.954 --> 01:00:26.079
- Do you really think

01:00:26.205 --> 01:00:27.998
this video shit you're doing
is art, EIaine?

01:00:28.124 --> 01:00:29.708
- I'm not defining it
as a work of art, Joany.

01:00:29.834 --> 01:00:31.501
The gallery is.

01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:33.170
- Yeah, but you're making
this thing

01:00:33.296 --> 01:00:36.131
knowlng it's gonna be shown
in a gaIIery.

01:00:36.257 --> 01:00:38.175
- Yeah, but so much shit
is shown in galleries

01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:40.594
that perhaps it doesn't
mean anything anymore.

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:42.429
You know, like the Pope makes
whoever saints.

01:00:42.555 --> 01:00:43.513
[knocking at door]

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.641
Get that.

01:00:45.767 --> 01:00:47.225
- Why can't you?

01:00:47.352 --> 01:00:49.561
- [sighs]
lt's Dewey.

01:00:49.687 --> 01:00:52.230
He's going on and on
about this Beth thing.

01:00:52.357 --> 01:00:55.359
- [sighs]

01:00:58.112 --> 01:01:00.072
[pounding on door]

01:01:00.198 --> 01:01:03.867
You mean l have to deal
with your shit.

01:01:03.993 --> 01:01:05.535
[pounding on door]

01:01:05.662 --> 01:01:06.703
- Please?

01:01:08.706 --> 01:01:11.708
[pounding on door]

01:01:13.336 --> 01:01:16.338
[lighter clicks]

01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:20.217
Hi, Dewey.

01:01:20.343 --> 01:01:21.677
- Hi, is Elaine in?

01:01:21.803 --> 01:01:23.011
- She's not here right now,

01:01:23.137 --> 01:01:26.264
but do you want me to give her
a message or something?

01:01:26.391 --> 01:01:27.933
- I've Ieft her
about a million messages,

01:01:28.059 --> 01:01:30.477
and she never gets back to me.

01:01:30.603 --> 01:01:35.524
- Well, as soon as she gets in,
I'II have her come up, okay?

01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:38.402
- Joany, do you really think
l'm that stupid?

01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:41.530
l can hear you guys
through the fucking fioorboards.

01:01:41.656 --> 01:01:44.324
- lt's notjust about you,
Dewey.

01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:46.410
Elaine's got to think
about her career.

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:47.744
lt's her first show.

01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:50.831
lt's like a really big deal.

01:01:50.957 --> 01:01:52.374
- But l introduced her,

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:55.419
and then she just dropped me
Iike a piece of shit.

01:01:55.545 --> 01:02:00.298
l'm so tired of being
fucked over.

01:02:00.425 --> 01:02:04.386
- Oh, Dewey.

01:02:04.512 --> 01:02:05.345
Dewey.

01:02:05.471 --> 01:02:06.388
Try and get some sleep.

01:02:06.514 --> 01:02:07.514
You look like shit.

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:09.057
- Oh, fuck off!

01:02:09.183 --> 01:02:12.185
l don't need to hear that now!

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:21.194
[train rumbling]

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:24.030
[knocking at door]

01:02:24.157 --> 01:02:25.073
- Dewey.

01:02:25.199 --> 01:02:28.285
- l'm going to kill myself.

01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:29.786
- Oh, please.

01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:38.670
l feel really bad.

01:02:38.796 --> 01:02:40.714
- Oh, he'll get over it.

01:02:46.721 --> 01:02:50.974
- Honey, honey,
of course l'm not ashamed.

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:52.225
All right, l got to go.

01:02:52.351 --> 01:02:53.643
Bob.

01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:54.978
- l know about you and Jean.

01:02:55.104 --> 01:02:56.146
lt really doesn't matter.

01:02:56.272 --> 01:02:57.314
- Me and Jean?

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:58.857
- Water under the bridge.

01:02:58.983 --> 01:03:00.901
- Look, Bob, l assure you-

01:03:01.027 --> 01:03:02.319
- Art.

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:05.489
Art, l want to sell
a few things.

01:03:05.615 --> 01:03:06.907
In fact,
l want to sell everything.

01:03:07.033 --> 01:03:08.408
- Jesus, mother of God.

01:03:08.534 --> 01:03:09.701
What, the whole lot?

01:03:09.827 --> 01:03:10.786
- Yeah.

01:03:10.912 --> 01:03:12.329
And there's one condition.

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:13.663
lf you want to handle the sale,

01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:15.081
you cannot talk to Jean
about it.

01:03:15.208 --> 01:03:16.374
- Of course.

01:03:16.501 --> 01:03:17.667
Are you serious, Bob?

01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:21.296
- Absolutely.

01:03:21.422 --> 01:03:24.966
Anyway,
Jean's off to New York.

01:03:25.092 --> 01:03:27.093
- [sighs]

01:03:30.431 --> 01:03:32.724
Where do we begin?

01:03:32.850 --> 01:03:36.561
[laughter]

01:03:36.687 --> 01:03:38.063
The whole lot, huh?

01:03:38.189 --> 01:03:39.147
- The whole lot.

01:03:39.273 --> 01:03:40.941
- Dear Mr. Spindle,

01:03:41.067 --> 01:03:43.902
Alfreda has been approached
by a third party

01:03:44.028 --> 01:03:46.571
with an offer
substantially higher

01:03:46.697 --> 01:03:49.241
than the one
we recently discussed.

01:03:49.367 --> 01:03:51.576
ln the light of your ongoing
interest in the painting,

01:03:51.702 --> 01:03:54.704
she thought it onIy fair
to inform you of her intention

01:03:54.831 --> 01:03:57.374
to accept this offer.

01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:01.378
Your obedient servant,
Robert Freign.

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:05.715
- Mr. Maclestone?

01:04:05.842 --> 01:04:08.218
- Call me Bob, Paige.

01:04:08.344 --> 01:04:10.428
- Bob.

01:04:10.555 --> 01:04:12.097
These are really amazing.

01:04:12.223 --> 01:04:14.808
Just wanted to congratulate you
on becoming a director.

01:04:14.934 --> 01:04:17.936
- Thank you.

01:04:23.317 --> 01:04:25.443
- Paige.

01:04:25.570 --> 01:04:26.611
Do you like Turkish food?

01:04:28.281 --> 01:04:29.990
- l don't know.

01:04:30.116 --> 01:04:32.200
- l found this new great place,

01:04:32.326 --> 01:04:34.619
and l was thinking
dinner Thursday.

01:04:36.706 --> 01:04:38.248
l'll have my assistant call you.

01:04:42.795 --> 01:04:46.798
[engine sputtering]

01:04:46.924 --> 01:04:49.885
- lt's all about money.

01:04:50.011 --> 01:04:52.345
They have no love for art.

01:04:52.471 --> 01:04:53.972
lt's just money:

01:04:54.098 --> 01:04:56.725
what they get,
what they sell,

01:04:56.851 --> 01:04:57.934
how much.

01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:00.353
- 28 million
is a considerable amount.

01:05:00.479 --> 01:05:01.396
- [scoffs]

01:05:01.522 --> 01:05:02.898
- And given our circumstances,

01:05:03.024 --> 01:05:04.983
we shouId at Ieast
think about the offer.

01:05:05.109 --> 01:05:07.694
- Waste of time.

01:05:10.489 --> 01:05:11.948
- Ah.

01:05:12.074 --> 01:05:13.283
- Dear Alfreda.

01:05:13.409 --> 01:05:15.285

Good evening, Alfred.

and discuss the recent offer.

01:05:58.245 --> 01:05:59.537
l must say,

01:05:59.664 --> 01:06:01.498
it's a little unorthodox.

01:06:01.624 --> 01:06:03.500

01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:06.294

You come into my house.

01:06:56.220 --> 01:06:57.178
You start snooping around.

01:06:57.304 --> 01:07:00.473
And you are trying
to get your greedy hands

01:07:00.599 --> 01:07:02.934

it's where Leonardo

through the discovery
of fossilized seashells

01:20:43.630 --> 01:20:46.173

- This is Elaine Proctor.
It's her show.

01:22:31.571 --> 01:22:33.656
The first time l saw her work,
l was a little weirded out.

01:22:33.782 --> 01:22:34.782
And then l thought,

01:22:34.908 --> 01:22:36.867
"This is her art,
and this is her vision,

01:22:36.993 --> 01:22:38.452

01:22:51.633 --> 01:22:52.633
- Well, he fires her.

01:22:52.759 --> 01:22:54.176
He's trying to sue her,
and here he is

01:22:54.302 --> 01:22:56.011
in her gallery.

01:22:56.137 --> 01:22:58.180
Hello, Art.

01:22:58.306 --> 01:23:01.058

You couldn't even make

01:23:25.583 --> 01:23:28.210
- A cake, Joany?

01:23:28.336 --> 01:23:29.795
