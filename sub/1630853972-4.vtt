WEBVTT

00:11.489 --> 00:13.728
<i>
Now what is this bullshit?</i>

00:13.761 --> 00:16.600
Um, which of the many species
of bullshit

00:16.634 --> 00:19.105
in our bullshit ecosystem
are you referring to?

00:19.138 --> 00:21.142
The jellybeans,
which are only licorice,

00:21.175 --> 00:22.311
buttered popcorn, and--

00:22.344 --> 00:24.516
mm--I think, hatred?

00:24.550 --> 00:26.486
Or the coffee maker,
which is gone

00:26.520 --> 00:28.323
and replaced
by off-brand instant?

00:28.356 --> 00:30.160
"Folber's Crystals,

00:30.193 --> 00:32.331
an acceptable part
of waking up."

00:32.364 --> 00:34.101
It's these chip flavors.

00:34.135 --> 00:38.276
Snail, paella, Dutch onion,
and... menthol?

00:38.310 --> 00:40.280
Wow, a bag of these
has more nicotine

00:40.314 --> 00:41.617
than a pack of cigarettes.

00:41.650 --> 00:43.086
Well, now I wanna try them.

00:43.119 --> 00:44.422
This is why you'll fill out

00:44.455 --> 00:46.794
your food requisition forms properly,

00:46.827 --> 00:49.131
otherwise you get the leftovers
from Headquarters

00:49.165 --> 00:50.568
that no one wants.

00:50.602 --> 00:52.572
Is there any part of IIA
that isn't some kind of

00:52.606 --> 00:55.177
Kafka-meets-Brazil
bureaucratic circle jerk?

00:55.210 --> 00:57.448
See?
This is why you lack vision.

00:57.481 --> 01:00.387
Our company-mandated
biquarterly circle jerks

01:00.420 --> 01:02.258
decrease sexual frustration

01:02.291 --> 01:05.163
and increase productivity
by 6%.

01:05.197 --> 01:07.434
Is he joking, or is it
about to get awesome in here?

01:07.468 --> 01:10.073
New mission:
there's a device out there

01:10.107 --> 01:11.543
that we need to reacquire.

01:11.577 --> 01:13.280
So not awesome.

01:13.313 --> 01:15.685
- The Magnetic Pulse Generator.
- Magnets?

01:15.718 --> 01:17.187
Are we worried
someone will attack

01:17.221 --> 01:18.658
a kindergarten science class?

01:18.691 --> 01:20.561
It can wipe out
all computer memory

01:20.595 --> 01:21.830
in a mile radius.

01:21.864 --> 01:23.300
And it does this.

01:27.575 --> 01:29.613
Ooh,
props to the graphics team.

01:29.646 --> 01:32.284
I was skeptical,
but they're so worth it.

01:32.318 --> 01:35.525
Wait a second.
I know that death metal device.

01:35.558 --> 01:36.794
That's Helga!

01:36.827 --> 01:38.330
How do you know about my Helga?

01:38.363 --> 01:39.866
I have cameras
planted everywhere,

01:39.900 --> 01:41.202
including your lab.

01:41.235 --> 01:42.806
How dare you!

01:42.839 --> 01:44.108
Didn't you set up cameras

01:44.141 --> 01:45.612
in all the bathrooms
at one point?

01:45.645 --> 01:47.582
Putting cameras in bathrooms
is one thing.

01:47.616 --> 01:49.786
But a lab?
That is private.

01:49.820 --> 01:51.724
I saw potential
in your project

01:51.757 --> 01:55.263
if paired with a proprietary
IIA energy source,

01:55.297 --> 01:58.638
but after I stole it from you,
someone stole it from me.

01:58.671 --> 02:00.575
The Swiss.

02:00.608 --> 02:02.444
- The Swiss?
- The cheese guys?

02:02.478 --> 02:04.616
1929. Black Monday.

02:04.650 --> 02:06.219
The Swiss.

02:06.252 --> 02:09.325
The Cuban Missile Crisis. Swiss.

02:09.358 --> 02:12.532
1985. The Cola Wars.

02:12.565 --> 02:14.335
That is one alert mob.

02:14.368 --> 02:15.905
These elite Swiss operatives

02:15.938 --> 02:18.143
call themselves
the Invisible Hand.

02:18.176 --> 02:19.211
Oh, yeah.

02:19.245 --> 02:20.314
Mother sometimes
talked about them

02:20.347 --> 02:21.517
when she was drinking.

02:21.550 --> 02:22.886
She said it was like
the entire country

02:22.919 --> 02:24.723
extracted
all their war-like impulses

02:24.756 --> 02:26.860
and injected them
into a tiny group of people.

02:26.894 --> 02:28.798
They're going
after the Cayman Islands

02:28.831 --> 02:30.935
because the global rich
are banking there

02:30.968 --> 02:32.739
and not banking in Switzerland.

02:32.772 --> 02:34.876
Oh, no.
Rich people problems.

02:34.910 --> 02:36.780
If the Invisible Hand succeeds,

02:36.814 --> 02:39.920
it would throw IIA
into financial chaos

02:39.953 --> 02:42.224
and probably ignite
a global war.

02:42.257 --> 02:43.594
Well, that's not good.

02:43.627 --> 02:45.865
Ah, yes, Lana,
the old saying.

02:45.898 --> 02:47.802
"War is not good."

02:47.836 --> 02:50.374
So we steal the device back
before the Swiss can use it.

02:50.407 --> 02:53.179
With the help
of your demolitions expert!

02:53.213 --> 02:55.183
all: Huh?
- I get it.

02:55.217 --> 02:56.386
When Ms. Archer was in charge,

02:56.419 --> 02:57.856
she didn't really
go on missions,

02:57.889 --> 02:59.693
but I'm a hands-on boss.

02:59.726 --> 03:01.496
You are not the boss.

03:01.530 --> 03:02.799
I'm in the chair!

03:02.832 --> 03:04.703
I need this to go
by the book,

03:04.736 --> 03:07.241
and since my last leader
is still in the hospital

03:07.274 --> 03:09.311
due to snake
and multiple spider bites...

03:09.345 --> 03:11.583
I forgot that.
It was really bad.

03:11.617 --> 03:13.654
Agent Figgis
is leading the mission.

03:13.687 --> 03:15.223
- Oh, great.
- Obviously.

03:15.257 --> 03:17.461
For the last time,
let me say this.

03:17.494 --> 03:19.465
You're not my supervisor!

03:19.498 --> 03:20.768
I quit.

03:22.972 --> 03:25.377
Ah, don't worry, bud.
She'll be back.

03:25.410 --> 03:27.281
Oh, those Swiss bastards

03:27.314 --> 03:29.485
got their dirty,
cheese-stinking fingers

03:29.519 --> 03:32.525
all over my beautiful device!

03:32.559 --> 03:33.961
Wait.
Where's Cheryl?

03:33.994 --> 03:35.631
Okay,
let's go destroy this thing.

03:35.665 --> 03:38.269
- Reacquire it.
- Uh, I doubt it.

03:38.303 --> 03:39.706
Have you met us?

04:23.694 --> 04:24.696
So before the Swiss

04:24.729 --> 04:26.533
<i>wipe the banks' data
on the mainland,</i>

04:26.567 --> 04:27.969
they plan to blow up
the backup server

04:28.002 --> 04:29.806
stored
on this old drilling platform.

04:29.840 --> 04:31.977
Our job is to intercept them,
then interrogate them

04:32.010 --> 04:33.614
to find out
where they stored the device.

04:33.647 --> 04:35.818
So the device
isn't on the rig?

04:35.852 --> 04:36.820
We don't think so.

04:36.854 --> 04:38.356
To access the rig,

04:38.389 --> 04:40.561
we'll enter undetected
through this hatch here

04:40.595 --> 04:42.532
then locate
and ambush the Swiss.

04:42.565 --> 04:44.435
God, you are so bad at this.

04:44.468 --> 04:47.374
It's like watching a clown car
crash into a birthday party.

04:47.407 --> 04:49.546
Tragic,
but at some level, hilarious.

04:49.579 --> 04:51.617
Archer, can you please
put the bourbon down

04:51.650 --> 04:53.587
and concentrate?
- Scotch. No.

04:53.621 --> 04:54.990
And don't you think
you should concentrate?

04:55.023 --> 04:56.459
We're already behind schedule.

04:56.492 --> 04:57.762
Because you stopped
at the liquor store

04:57.795 --> 04:59.031
on the way to the airport!

04:59.064 --> 05:00.835
Because I knew
you wouldn't stock the plane,

05:00.868 --> 05:03.006
so maybe next time
be a little more professional.

05:03.039 --> 05:04.676
This from the man who
invented the term

05:04.709 --> 05:05.778
"groin taxi."

05:05.812 --> 05:07.649
Ha!
Shows what you know.

05:07.682 --> 05:10.387
That was a term I used to
cleverly expense prostitutes.

05:10.420 --> 05:11.824
- We all know that!
- Lana.

05:11.857 --> 05:13.493
You're only
making things worse.

05:13.527 --> 05:15.463
I've got this.
- Yeah, Lana.

05:15.497 --> 05:17.434
Our leader, Cyril's, got this.

05:17.467 --> 05:18.604
Just listen to him

05:18.637 --> 05:20.541
since he's obviously
our superior.

05:20.575 --> 05:22.411
Speaking of superiors,

05:22.444 --> 05:25.016
I try to insulate myself
from peasant work,

05:25.050 --> 05:27.354
but this has got
to go perfectly.

05:27.387 --> 05:28.624
None of us want to be fired.

05:28.657 --> 05:30.460
Oh, no,
not fired,

05:30.493 --> 05:33.499
the thing you threaten us with
every day of our goddamn lives.

05:33.534 --> 05:34.603
You misunderstand.

05:34.636 --> 05:37.374
A mistake this big
at our level?

05:37.407 --> 05:41.517
After the firing,
then there's the firing squad.

05:41.550 --> 05:43.353
I'm using wordplay here,
of course.

05:43.386 --> 05:44.488
all: Oh!
Oh, thank God.

05:44.523 --> 05:47.394
They'll probably
just poison us.

05:52.037 --> 05:54.141
So I feel like
that imminent death thing

05:54.174 --> 05:55.745
kind of derailed my briefing.

05:55.778 --> 05:57.414
Any questions?
- Yeah.

05:57.447 --> 05:59.485
Why did Fabian
put you in charge?

05:59.519 --> 06:02.659
You're, like, notoriously bad
in high-stress situations.

06:02.692 --> 06:04.461
What?
Name one time.

06:04.495 --> 06:06.867
Last week, you got hives
trying to decide

06:06.900 --> 06:09.739
between "best"
or "best regards" in an email.

06:09.773 --> 06:12.077
Okay, well,
that was a tonal minefield.

06:12.110 --> 06:13.781
I wish it were a real one,

06:13.814 --> 06:16.052
and then we wouldn't be
having this conversation.

06:16.085 --> 06:18.557
Who did you think
Fabian was gonna pick?

06:18.591 --> 06:21.028
Archer can't do it.
Lana's a threat to power.

06:21.062 --> 06:23.066
And Krieger is... Krieger.

06:23.099 --> 06:24.736
There's nobody left.
- I'm left.

06:24.769 --> 06:26.005
You don't know
the first thing

06:26.038 --> 06:27.609
about leading a mission, Pam.

06:27.642 --> 06:29.445
I know you've got
about 60 seconds

06:29.478 --> 06:32.785
before your tactical lead there
hurls chum into the ocean.

06:32.819 --> 06:36.092
Archer, I told you to leave
the booze on the plane.

06:37.762 --> 06:40.133
But I didn't.

06:40.166 --> 06:41.970
Okay, we get on the rig.

06:42.004 --> 06:44.475
Lana and Pam will get
any rig workers to a safe room.

06:44.509 --> 06:46.780
Archer and I will start--
- Hey, sea turtles!

06:46.813 --> 06:48.550
Whoo!
- What?

06:48.584 --> 06:50.988
You're supposed to stay more
than 10 feet away from those!

06:51.022 --> 06:52.424
And are you
supposed to be sober

06:52.457 --> 06:53.928
when you make
new best friends?

06:53.961 --> 06:55.865
Because I'm not
doing that either!

06:55.898 --> 06:57.902
Lana, a little help here.

06:57.936 --> 06:59.673
I thought
I was making things worse.

06:59.706 --> 07:01.142
"I got this."

07:01.175 --> 07:02.679
- Called it.

07:02.712 --> 07:04.916
That wasn't from drinking.

07:04.950 --> 07:06.787
I ate those menthol chips
on the plane.

07:06.820 --> 07:09.491
But now that my head's clear,
I have two questions.

07:09.526 --> 07:11.930
What are we doing?
And which ocean is this?

07:11.964 --> 07:13.867
Explain to me
how we can defuse this

07:13.901 --> 07:15.203
if it gets activated.

07:15.236 --> 07:16.472
That's easy.

07:16.506 --> 07:18.176
You can't
because it's not a bomb.

07:18.209 --> 07:20.113
It's a resonating superconductor.

07:20.146 --> 07:22.217
Once it starts, the pulse
gets bigger and bigger

07:22.250 --> 07:23.887
until it tears itself apart.

07:23.921 --> 07:26.560
- Well, what can you do?
- I don't remember.

07:26.593 --> 07:27.929
I built it in--

07:27.962 --> 07:30.100
what do you call it--
a fugue state?

07:30.133 --> 07:33.641
By "fugue state," you mean
shit-assed on drugs, right?

07:33.674 --> 07:35.210
Of course not!

07:35.243 --> 07:37.214
But that was also happening, yes.

07:38.917 --> 07:40.821
Hey, Lana,
do you ever get the sense

07:40.855 --> 07:42.659
that certain people
in this group get ignored?

07:42.692 --> 07:44.963
Mm, which certain people?

07:44.996 --> 07:47.902
Well, to put it delicately,
the ones with tits.

07:47.935 --> 07:50.574
Thank you for being delicate,
but yes.

07:50.608 --> 07:52.578
I can't just force myself
to care anymore.

07:52.612 --> 07:54.949
I just wanna do my job
and go home.

07:54.983 --> 07:56.920
But I have a lot
of great qualities.

07:56.953 --> 07:58.590
I always keep Cheryl in line.

07:58.624 --> 08:00.528
Yeah,
I would not lead with that.

08:02.565 --> 08:04.268
Is it just me, or--

08:04.301 --> 08:06.907
Is nobody here?
Great job, Cyril.

08:06.940 --> 08:08.510
They got away.
Who?

08:08.544 --> 08:10.981
Whoever we're capturing,
shooting, and/or rescuing.

08:11.015 --> 08:13.019
How would we shoot
and rescue them?

08:13.052 --> 08:14.221
Hmm.
Mercy killing?

08:14.254 --> 08:16.092
We're late
because of your delays!

08:16.125 --> 08:18.162
Excuse me for being enchanted
by turtles,

08:18.196 --> 08:20.634
the world's most mysterious
sea creatures.

08:20.668 --> 08:23.272
Oh, come on.
Everyone knows that's narwhals.

08:23.306 --> 08:24.876
Pfft, only if the mystery is

08:24.909 --> 08:26.947
who's overcompensating
for something.

08:26.980 --> 08:28.851
No one's here
because Cyril messed up,

08:28.884 --> 08:30.688
probably due to his obsession
with narwhals.

08:30.721 --> 08:31.857
Let's meet up on the deck

08:31.890 --> 08:34.763
and talk about
how much we hate him.

08:34.796 --> 08:38.102
Pfft, narwhals.
Basically the Ferrari of tusks.

08:38.136 --> 08:39.806
- Wait, check for--
- Aah!

08:39.839 --> 08:41.710
I am called Alessia.

08:41.743 --> 08:45.116
I represent the Invisible Hand,
and that was a warning shot.

08:45.150 --> 08:47.254
How was that a warning shot?
You grazed me.

08:47.287 --> 08:50.661
I'm very good.

08:50.694 --> 08:52.030
I'm baffled
by the complete lack

08:52.064 --> 08:54.602
of pornographic doodling
on these schematics.

08:54.636 --> 08:56.973
Are you sure these IIA folks
are real scientists?

08:57.007 --> 09:00.213
Oh, for God's sake!
I'm so fudged right now.

09:00.246 --> 09:03.754
I need to know how to safely
transport this thing now!

09:03.787 --> 09:05.023
I'm fudged!

09:05.056 --> 09:07.829
Is there anyone
at IIA you can talk to?

09:07.862 --> 09:09.833
No!
If the board finds out...

09:09.866 --> 09:12.170
- You're fudged?
- I'm fudging fudged!

09:12.204 --> 09:13.741
If you can't figure this out,

09:13.774 --> 09:15.611
I will throw you out
of this plane.

09:15.644 --> 09:17.280
Well, there is a way
to disable it

09:17.314 --> 09:19.284
before it goes off,
but it's dicey.

09:19.318 --> 09:20.988
Requires extreme precision.

09:21.021 --> 09:22.592
- What?

09:22.625 --> 09:24.596
I was just thinking
about who I was counting on

09:24.629 --> 09:26.198
to be precise.

09:26.232 --> 09:28.904
- Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

09:28.937 --> 09:31.610
- Hiyah!
- Ooh!

09:31.643 --> 09:33.914
This rig is set
to self-destruct.

09:33.947 --> 09:36.218
Don't worry,
we've evacuated the workers

09:36.252 --> 09:38.356
and given them
little chocolates.

09:38.389 --> 09:40.895
The Invisible Hand isn't evil,

09:40.928 --> 09:42.832
but if you get
in our way again,

09:42.865 --> 09:44.201
you will be eliminated.

09:44.234 --> 09:46.740
Yep,
totally non-evil thing to say.

09:46.773 --> 09:48.844
Well, regardless,
remember it.

09:48.877 --> 09:49.979
I didn't hear it.

09:50.013 --> 09:51.850
Could you say it again
but slower

09:51.883 --> 09:53.754
and turn your chin
to catch the light?

09:53.787 --> 09:56.660
I said,
if I see you again,

09:56.693 --> 09:59.164
I'll eliminate you.

09:59.198 --> 10:01.068
Chocolate?

10:01.102 --> 10:02.839
My God.

10:04.909 --> 10:05.978
The turtles!

10:06.011 --> 10:07.648
If the rig collapses...

10:07.682 --> 10:09.284
What's the plan, Cyril?
Are we stuck here?

10:09.318 --> 10:11.723
No!
We still have their ropes.

10:14.996 --> 10:17.167
I am now open to suggestions.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.737
Protect yourselves!

10:18.770 --> 10:21.175
Pull your heads
into your beautiful shells!

10:21.208 --> 10:22.745
What do we do?
What do we do?

10:22.778 --> 10:24.081
Wait, I've got it.

10:24.114 --> 10:26.051
"Best regards."
That's the one.

10:26.085 --> 10:27.755
God damn it, Cyril. Jump.

10:27.788 --> 10:30.995
But we're hundreds
of feet--aah!

10:31.028 --> 10:33.901
Cannonball!

10:37.307 --> 10:38.911
He really did it.

10:38.944 --> 10:41.716
He's gonna die trying
to save turtles while drunk.

10:41.750 --> 10:44.087
Well, at least he'll die
doing what he loves.

10:44.121 --> 10:45.624
Being an idiot.

10:51.803 --> 10:53.272
Oh, look.

10:53.306 --> 10:55.443
It's a visual metaphor
for your leadership.

10:55.476 --> 10:56.847
Hey, that's not fair.

10:56.880 --> 10:58.750
He's right,
because that platform

10:58.784 --> 11:00.353
would've collapsed years ago.

11:00.386 --> 11:03.392
It hasn't gone that badly.

11:03.426 --> 11:06.165
And cue the sharks.

11:06.198 --> 11:07.869
Whoo!

11:07.902 --> 11:10.373
Zodiac!

11:10.406 --> 11:12.444
Okay, guys, hop in,
but be careful.

11:12.477 --> 11:14.381
There's not a lot of room
with all these turtles in here.

11:14.414 --> 11:16.151
Just put them back
in the ocean!

11:16.185 --> 11:17.420
What? No.

11:17.454 --> 11:19.024
There's, like,
a ton of sharks out there.

11:19.057 --> 11:20.694
Attracted by your vomit!

11:20.728 --> 11:22.197
Those are vomit sharks?

11:25.203 --> 11:27.374
I said, "These are vomit"--
- We heard you.

11:27.407 --> 11:30.179
Yet you refuse
to embrace the mystery!

11:30.213 --> 11:32.818
Hey, bud, at what point
do you think you'll slow down?

11:32.852 --> 11:34.822
It's to be determined, Pam.

11:34.856 --> 11:37.929
Now,
you pack of absolute morons,

11:37.962 --> 11:39.933
you've blown our chance
to grab this thing

11:39.966 --> 11:42.070
before it's operational,
but there's still a chance.

11:42.103 --> 11:43.740
But it'll be tight.
We have to--

11:43.774 --> 11:46.846
Shut that idiocy production
factory you call a mouth!

11:46.880 --> 11:48.115
You're no longer in charge.

11:48.149 --> 11:49.852
The backup servers
are destroyed,

11:49.886 --> 11:51.255
so the banks will scramble

11:51.288 --> 11:53.326
to make physical backups
of their data.

11:53.359 --> 11:54.929
Which means
they'll be dismantling

11:54.963 --> 11:56.432
their electromagnetic shielding.

11:56.465 --> 11:59.171
Precisely, but you're
not in charge either.

11:59.204 --> 12:01.108
The Swiss will wait
for a few hours

12:01.141 --> 12:03.780
for peak vulnerability
and then set it off.

12:03.814 --> 12:05.450
We'll intercept them
on the way in.

12:05.483 --> 12:07.888
Uh, explain
why we're doing this again.

12:07.922 --> 12:09.826
This sure seems like
your mess-up.

12:09.859 --> 12:11.997
You're not wrong,
but if the banks go down

12:12.030 --> 12:15.436
and the world erupts in chaos,
IIA will need scapegoats.

12:15.470 --> 12:17.173
They'll burn you.

12:17.207 --> 12:19.077
- Hey, Lana.

12:19.111 --> 12:21.115
Have you noticed
there's a leadership vacuum

12:21.148 --> 12:23.052
now with Cyril
being a little bitch and all?

12:23.085 --> 12:25.023
No offense.
- That is not possible.

12:25.056 --> 12:27.327
Oh, my God, I just want
to do my job and go home,

12:27.360 --> 12:29.231
but it's not working.

12:29.264 --> 12:31.001
- So you know what happens now?
- I think--

12:31.035 --> 12:34.141
I take over
and fix everything!

12:34.174 --> 12:36.178
Exactly what I was gonna say.

12:38.349 --> 12:40.453
Okay, platoons.
Here we go.

12:40.486 --> 12:42.558
Lana, keep your eyes southeast.

12:42.591 --> 12:44.461
Archer, you look northwest.

12:44.494 --> 12:47.334
Cyril, you look...
in the other direction.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.872
Uh, I don't remember
Fabian putting you in charge.

12:49.906 --> 12:51.375
Pipe down, cadet.

12:51.408 --> 12:53.245
Better listen, Cyril.
She means business.

12:53.279 --> 12:55.483
Lana, shut your tits!
Keep this line clear.

12:55.517 --> 12:57.120
You know,
for a global banking center,

12:57.153 --> 12:58.991
this place is way smaller
than I imagined.

12:59.024 --> 13:00.828
Island fact:
it actually has

13:00.861 --> 13:03.065
more registered businesses
than it has residents.

13:03.099 --> 13:05.103
God damn it, Archer.
Are you drinking again?

13:05.136 --> 13:07.575
Again implies that
I stopped at some point, Pam.

13:07.608 --> 13:09.378
And I'm supporting
local businesses

13:09.411 --> 13:11.415
against
these international goliaths,

13:11.448 --> 13:13.119
so I'm basically David.

13:13.152 --> 13:14.254
Except drunk.

13:14.287 --> 13:16.526
Hey, hey, hey,
David was a musician

13:16.559 --> 13:19.097
with eight wives
who killed a dude with a rock.

13:19.131 --> 13:20.466
Does that scream sober to you?

13:20.500 --> 13:22.003
Speaking
of human liabilities,

13:22.037 --> 13:23.205
has anyone heard from Cheryl?

13:23.239 --> 13:24.876
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

13:24.909 --> 13:26.445
but I kind of miss her.

13:26.478 --> 13:28.249
Yeah,
feels like a great moment

13:28.282 --> 13:31.155
for some wildly
unhelpful curveball.

13:32.424 --> 13:34.328
Got her.
They just turned her on.

13:34.361 --> 13:37.334
Warming up now, getting ready
for her big debut.

13:37.367 --> 13:39.171
Aw, Helga.

13:39.204 --> 13:41.843
They grow up so fast.
- Okay, everyone.

13:41.876 --> 13:43.847
The package is coming in
from the south.

13:43.880 --> 13:45.483
Wait.
It's coming in way too fast.

13:45.517 --> 13:46.452
It must be in the air.

13:47.922 --> 13:49.625
Well, that simplifies things.

13:54.401 --> 13:56.105
They're running away.
- Wait.

13:56.138 --> 13:57.975
No, the package
is still on track.

13:58.009 --> 13:59.478
How could that--

14:04.054 --> 14:06.626
So she's going
to activate it in the air

14:06.659 --> 14:08.396
as she flies over the city.

14:08.429 --> 14:10.634
What a cleverly Beverly.

14:14.041 --> 14:15.878
God, she's like a Valkyrie.

14:15.911 --> 14:18.950
Take me to Valhalla.

14:18.984 --> 14:20.521
I've got a wingsuit
in the back.

14:20.554 --> 14:22.023
Krieger, take the stick

14:22.057 --> 14:23.894
and continue
my intercept course.

14:23.927 --> 14:25.396
No, you fudging idiot!
Don't--

14:25.430 --> 14:28.302
Give me back my baby!

14:31.341 --> 14:33.513
Now, I will expertly
swoop by and grab the--

14:33.547 --> 14:35.316
I don't know
how to do any of that!

14:35.349 --> 14:37.320
Aah!

14:40.293 --> 14:42.932
Archer,
commandeer a vehicle.

14:42.965 --> 14:44.969
- I'm sorry about this...
- Hey!

14:45.002 --> 14:47.173
But would it kill you
to do some maintenance?

14:50.379 --> 14:51.950
Hello, Occifers.

14:51.983 --> 14:53.385
Obviously,
this truck is mine

14:53.419 --> 14:56.058
because why else
would I be holding a pineapple?

14:59.030 --> 15:00.266
To the junkyard!

15:16.131 --> 15:17.935
Do you think you could
stop soaking yourself

15:17.968 --> 15:19.204
in piña coladas?

15:19.237 --> 15:20.974
Who am I?
Jimmy Buffett's carpet?

15:21.008 --> 15:24.214
This is a modified painkiller,
which is way stronger.

15:24.247 --> 15:26.619
Second, you're not my boss.
Pam is.

15:26.653 --> 15:28.657
Would you put down
your damn drink?

15:28.690 --> 15:30.193
No!

15:30.226 --> 15:31.963
Damn it!
I'm out of ammo.

15:31.996 --> 15:33.098
Huh.

15:35.637 --> 15:37.608
Invisible Hand: Aah!

15:37.641 --> 15:40.581
You guys see that?
That was nuts, right?

15:40.614 --> 15:42.450
Ha ha!
Stupid Swiss.

15:42.484 --> 15:45.089
It's the Battle of Grauholz
all over again!

15:45.123 --> 15:47.995
Uh, guys?
Any quick tips on landing?

15:48.028 --> 15:49.431
Oh, God.
It's happening so fast!

15:49.464 --> 15:50.534
Whoa!

15:54.307 --> 15:55.511
Shh!

15:55.544 --> 15:58.082
It's okay.
Daddy's here.

15:58.115 --> 16:00.052
Uh,
not to ruin a sweet moment,

16:00.086 --> 16:02.591
which this is absolutely not,
but is that thing ticking?

16:02.625 --> 16:04.194
Huh, guess it is a bomb.

16:04.227 --> 16:06.699
My baby's all grown up.

16:08.402 --> 16:10.439
Tell him
not to disarm that device!

16:10.473 --> 16:11.743
Yeah, good luck with that.

16:11.776 --> 16:14.247
He doesn't listen to us.

16:14.281 --> 16:16.385
- Green wire?
- Yeah, probably.

16:16.418 --> 16:17.655
Ha ha ha!

16:17.688 --> 16:20.426
Triumph,
if a bit anticlimactic.

16:20.459 --> 16:22.297
Ugh, I hate how it always
works out for you,

16:22.330 --> 16:23.700
even when you're being a dick!

16:23.733 --> 16:25.671
You know, everyone has
been really on my back today,

16:25.704 --> 16:27.440
but in the end,
I'm always the best.

16:27.473 --> 16:28.475
To me!

16:31.114 --> 16:32.183
Uh, Krieger?

16:32.217 --> 16:34.120
- Oh, don't panic.
- Oh, good.

16:34.154 --> 16:36.425
No, don't panic.
Run!

16:44.542 --> 16:46.044
Get rid of your metals!

16:46.078 --> 16:49.117
Guns, belts, commemorative
Prussian war coins!

16:49.150 --> 16:53.058
God, this is, like, the worst
airport security line ever.

16:55.496 --> 16:56.733
Okay, I think we're...

16:58.369 --> 17:01.074
Totally screwed!
What the hell, Krieger?

17:01.108 --> 17:03.479
It's oscillating.
It'll get stronger each time!

17:03.513 --> 17:04.682
Why does it do that?

17:04.715 --> 17:06.753
Because science is weird!

17:06.786 --> 17:07.755
Take cover!

17:12.430 --> 17:14.569
If we don't stop her,
she'll keep expanding her range

17:14.602 --> 17:16.573
and wipe out all digital data
on the island.

17:18.510 --> 17:19.612
So we need to destroy it?

17:19.645 --> 17:21.081
No!

17:21.114 --> 17:22.083
But also yes.

17:22.116 --> 17:23.620
Aah!
What are we doing?

17:23.653 --> 17:25.089
Cyril,
you're not the leader anymore,

17:25.122 --> 17:26.626
so stop thinking.

17:26.659 --> 17:30.233
Bum-rush this metal chucker
and smash it to smithereens!

17:30.266 --> 17:32.538
Oof!

17:32.571 --> 17:34.675
Why aren't you
letting us save you?

17:34.709 --> 17:36.679
Oh, right,
they want this to happen.

17:36.713 --> 17:38.783
Never mind!
Makes sense now!

17:40.286 --> 17:41.756
Everybody,
grab something metal.

17:44.427 --> 17:47.267
Charge!

17:47.300 --> 17:49.505
Now let go!

17:49.538 --> 17:50.841
- Ow!
- Aah!

17:50.874 --> 17:52.845
Wow,
that was a great idea, Pam.

17:52.878 --> 17:54.447
Right?

18:01.863 --> 18:03.399
Well, that was bizarre.

18:03.432 --> 18:05.269
Don't just stand there,
you rich bastard.

18:05.303 --> 18:07.240
Fight!

18:11.248 --> 18:13.553
Those Swiss are fast learners.

18:13.586 --> 18:16.291
Damn their superior
educational system.

18:18.395 --> 18:20.801
Not on my watch, sister.

18:26.746 --> 18:28.850
Cold-cocked!

18:28.883 --> 18:31.556
Does that translate?
Because it's fantastic.

18:31.589 --> 18:33.727
Ugh, you again?

18:37.467 --> 18:39.705
I don't know
if I want to fight you, be you,

18:39.739 --> 18:40.874
or sleep with you.

18:42.210 --> 18:43.312
Well, let's start
with the first

18:43.345 --> 18:44.582
and see how it goes.

18:46.418 --> 18:49.357
Aw, man.
Now I gotta get a tetanus shot.

18:52.898 --> 18:55.469
If you want something
done right--ow!

18:55.504 --> 18:57.841
Fuck!
My fucking hand!

18:57.875 --> 18:59.377
Oh, look at it.

18:59.411 --> 19:02.584
See you when it's over.
Fabian out.

19:02.618 --> 19:04.722
Cover me.
I'm gonna try to destroy it.

19:06.491 --> 19:08.797
Oh, is that
a Tudor Oyster Explorer?

19:08.830 --> 19:09.765
Sweet--

19:11.435 --> 19:13.873
Ow!
What the hell?

19:13.907 --> 19:15.777
I maybe shouldn't
have chugged the pineapple.

19:15.811 --> 19:17.815
There were, like,
six different rums in there,

19:17.848 --> 19:19.618
and now they're fighting.

19:22.658 --> 19:24.528
It's so liberating
not to think all the time.

19:24.562 --> 19:27.233
Here, take this!
You take that!

19:30.974 --> 19:32.878
Krieger,
how do we destroy this?

19:32.911 --> 19:34.648
Heads up,
you Swiss bitch!

19:34.682 --> 19:36.552
Oh, God! Sorry!

19:36.586 --> 19:38.523
I was just trying
to knock you down.

19:38.556 --> 19:40.359
- Just shoot it!
- How?

19:40.393 --> 19:43.232
Shoot anywhere when
the magnet is in attract mode.

19:44.969 --> 19:46.506
Archer, get on!

19:46.539 --> 19:48.643
Whoa!

19:48.676 --> 19:51.516
Your Amazonian body
takes up too much space, Lana.

19:51.549 --> 19:52.551
I can't balance.

19:52.584 --> 19:53.920
Or maybe you can't balance

19:53.953 --> 19:55.524
because you are wasted!

19:55.557 --> 19:57.528
Babysitting me
isn't part of your job,

19:57.561 --> 19:59.865
as I've told you many times.

19:59.899 --> 20:02.236
Ugh,
shut up and grab the gun!

20:04.942 --> 20:07.648
Oh, God, is there no rhythm
to this thing?

20:07.681 --> 20:08.983
Guess not.

20:14.895 --> 20:16.532
Oh, I can't look.

20:21.308 --> 20:22.443
Aah!

20:24.314 --> 20:27.554
I hate
to mess you up like this.

20:27.588 --> 20:29.592
And here I thought
you were enjoying it.

20:29.625 --> 20:31.428
Are we, like, flirting?

20:31.461 --> 20:34.000
I mean, this is fun, but
I'd appreciate some clarity.

20:34.033 --> 20:37.340
Just tell me one thing.
Why is Fabian after us?

20:37.373 --> 20:39.277
He's the one
who sold us the device.

20:39.310 --> 20:40.312
He did?

20:41.983 --> 20:44.020
Just go.
- Really?

20:44.053 --> 20:46.959
Yeah, I mean,
we all know Fabian sucks.

20:46.993 --> 20:50.299
I'm not gonna sacrifice
a goddess for a douchebag.

20:50.332 --> 20:52.571
You know,
you're much more formidable

20:52.604 --> 20:54.842
than the two idiots
I encountered on the oil rig.

20:54.875 --> 20:57.514
They're lucky to have
an incredible leader.

20:57.548 --> 21:00.352
Aw, shucks.
Just get outta here.

21:04.895 --> 21:07.601
Alessia, wait!

21:07.634 --> 21:09.972
You got any more
of that chocolate?

21:10.005 --> 21:13.713
No!

21:13.746 --> 21:15.316
What happened here?

21:15.349 --> 21:16.451
Is Archer knocked out?

21:16.485 --> 21:17.788
Nope.

21:17.821 --> 21:19.925
He passed out unscathed.

21:21.629 --> 21:24.467
Wow, what a screwup.

21:24.502 --> 21:26.873
Who knew a pineapple
could hold that much rum?

21:26.906 --> 21:28.543
So I blacked out and did
something amazing, right?

21:28.576 --> 21:29.879
That's what always happens.

21:29.912 --> 21:32.016
No need to say anything.
You're welcome.

21:32.049 --> 21:33.385
Looks like a nailed this.

21:33.418 --> 21:34.688
Oh, also nailing it,

21:34.722 --> 21:36.792
that nail
through your hand, Fabian.

21:36.826 --> 21:38.630
That looks like it hurts.

21:38.663 --> 21:39.798
Well, that's what happens

21:39.832 --> 21:41.334
when you're not
as awesome as me.

21:43.506 --> 21:45.710
So how about the Swiss, right?

22:06.418 --> 22:09.490
Made in Georgia.
