01:14.912 --> 01:17.748
Out, out, out!
Come on, move. Move!

01:20.125 --> 01:23.087
On the double!
Double double double!

01:23.212 --> 01:26.131
-- Come on, you special boys!
-- Move it!

01:26.257 --> 01:31.470
You black bastard...move it!

01:31.595 --> 01:33.556
Over there!

01:33.681 --> 01:35.474
You. In.

01:39.979 --> 01:42.106
Get up straight, boy.

01:42.231 --> 01:43.941
Attenshun.

01:45.109 --> 01:47.069
Name and number.

01:47.194 --> 01:49.238
4737, Carlin, sir.

01:50.656 --> 01:54.326
So this is the Daddy,
the 'ard case.

01:54.451 --> 01:56.412
Carlin, is it?

01:56.537 --> 01:58.831
-- Is it?
-- Yes, sir.

02:00.499 --> 02:02.585
Don't look much to me, Carlin.

02:02.710 --> 02:07.173
You're the little toerag who
thumped the officer at Roly.

02:09.008 --> 02:12.094
Fancy yourself, do you, Carlin?

02:12.219 --> 02:14.180
-- Thumpin' officers, eh?
-- I...

02:14.305 --> 02:16.765
Speak when I tell you, lad.

02:16.891 --> 02:19.768
They sent you here
to be sorted out.

02:19.894 --> 02:21.979
You have heard of us, eh?

02:23.731 --> 02:26.692
-- Heard of us, have you?
-- Yes, sir.

02:26.817 --> 02:30.154
-- And what did you hear?
-- Nothing, sir.

02:30.279 --> 02:35.451
I'll tell you, lad, "nothing"
was not the correct information.

02:35.576 --> 02:39.705
Because we're having your
hooligan guts for garters.

02:39.830 --> 02:42.082
-- Right?
-- Yes, sir.

02:55.179 --> 02:57.056
Pick it up!

03:04.230 --> 03:06.315
I said, pick it up!

03:14.865 --> 03:16.825
Name and number.

03:16.951 --> 03:21.205
4737, Carlin, sir.

03:21.330 --> 03:23.499
Get him out of here.

03:23.624 --> 03:27.378
Out, Carlin. Move it!
Go on, over there.

03:27.503 --> 03:29.588
You. In.

03:33.843 --> 03:35.928
Stand up straight, boy!

03:36.053 --> 03:38.013
-- Name and number.
-- Bastards.

03:38.138 --> 03:39.932
Bastards, bastards.

03:43.561 --> 03:45.563
Pick those feet up!

03:50.484 --> 03:52.486
Up!

03:54.947 --> 03:56.532
In.

04:08.836 --> 04:11.005
In line, Davis.

04:11.839 --> 04:13.632
Attenshun!

04:16.093 --> 04:18.345
Right, up those stairs.

04:20.096 --> 04:21.891
Move!

04:39.700 --> 04:43.996
Right. I'm Mr Sands,
this is Mr Greaves.

04:44.121 --> 04:48.083
I'm the senior officer
and I run A Wing.

04:48.209 --> 04:50.586
I run it. Right, Carlin?

04:50.711 --> 04:51.629
Yes, sir.

04:51.754 --> 04:55.799
I come down very heavy on anyone
who doesn't grasp that fact.

04:55.925 --> 04:57.676
Right? Right?!

04:57.801 --> 04:59.762
Yes, sir.

04:59.887 --> 05:03.182
Angel, you're in a single room.

05:03.307 --> 05:07.144
Some of the lads are
what you might call prejudiced.

05:07.269 --> 05:09.438
Keep yourself to yourself.

05:09.563 --> 05:11.565
Your first borstal, innit?

05:11.690 --> 05:14.276
Yes, sir,
apart from the Scrubs...

05:14.401 --> 05:16.612
Forget the Scrubs!
The holiday's over.

05:16.737 --> 05:18.531
Move!

05:18.656 --> 05:21.659
Davis, you ran away
from an open borstal.

05:21.784 --> 05:24.328
You'll soon wish
you were back there.

05:24.453 --> 05:26.539
You're in a single room.

05:26.664 --> 05:28.040
Move!

05:29.625 --> 05:31.210
Move it!

05:32.336 --> 05:35.506
Carlin, you're in a dormitory.

05:35.631 --> 05:37.216
Now, move!

05:38.884 --> 05:41.637
That's it, in there,
on the left.

05:45.850 --> 05:47.852
That's yours, Carlin.

05:50.062 --> 05:55.568
You know the ropes. I'll jump on
you if you so much as breathe.

05:55.693 --> 05:57.653
-- Got that?
-- Yes, sir.

05:57.778 --> 06:02.074
There's a lad, big lad,
called Pongo in that bed.

06:02.199 --> 06:05.077
He heard you were coming.

06:05.202 --> 06:09.039
Now, get to work on this floor.

06:09.164 --> 06:11.166
I wanna shave in it.

06:19.466 --> 06:21.051
Carlin?

06:22.178 --> 06:25.764
We don't leave our bed space
in that condition here.

06:25.890 --> 06:30.060
Make your bed and put
your gear away. On the double!

06:35.649 --> 06:37.860
Next time you're on report.

07:01.509 --> 07:03.928
Pick those feet up
and keep quiet!

07:09.642 --> 07:11.101
Banks?

07:11.227 --> 07:13.354
Look to your front, Banks.

07:13.479 --> 07:15.898
Carlin's been allocated
to your wing.

07:16.023 --> 07:19.276
-- You hear that?
-- Shut it, Richards!

07:20.402 --> 07:23.697
Three of 'em. You'll have
more company, won't you?

07:23.822 --> 07:24.907
Sir.

07:25.032 --> 07:28.035
-- One's a jungle bunny.
-- Yes, sir.

07:28.160 --> 07:31.080
Quiet, Richards. Another sound
and you're on report.

07:31.205 --> 07:32.790
Yes, sir.

08:26.719 --> 08:29.263
You off your fucking nut?

08:29.388 --> 08:31.182
Possibly.

08:35.852 --> 08:39.648
I'm a vegetarian, Carlin,
and I've read the rule book.

08:39.773 --> 08:41.734
I refuse to wear leather,

08:41.859 --> 08:44.278
get extra potatoes
as substitute for meat,

08:44.403 --> 08:46.488
and fish when on the menu.

08:46.614 --> 08:48.699
Yeah, but they give you stick.

08:48.824 --> 08:51.410
Yeah, but it causes
a lot of bother.

08:52.703 --> 08:54.663
How long you been here?

08:54.788 --> 08:57.082
A month. Transferred from Dover.

08:57.208 --> 08:59.502
-- Oh, nuisance.
-- No.

08:59.627 --> 09:02.046
Just told 'em I was Christ.

09:02.171 --> 09:06.050
Some bastard had the flash
of genius and banged me here.

09:06.175 --> 09:10.596
A, the Governor's religious,
B, they'll knock shit out of me.

09:10.721 --> 09:13.849
-- How long you done altogether?
-- 16 months.

09:13.974 --> 09:17.061
Jesus Christ, you must love it!

09:18.187 --> 09:20.606
They're not havin' me,
the bastards.

09:20.731 --> 09:22.983
I don't eat shit for anyone,

09:23.108 --> 09:25.694
and I don't give a monkey's.

09:25.819 --> 09:28.822
I'll walk out on crutches,
but they won't have me.

09:33.369 --> 09:35.454
Davis, up.

09:38.457 --> 09:40.417
Davis, you're nothing.

09:40.543 --> 09:43.045
I'm the Daddy, I run this wing.

09:43.170 --> 09:45.673
You pay your dues like the rest.

09:45.798 --> 09:49.969
Payday, you deliver quarter
of your snout to Stripey here,

09:50.094 --> 09:52.054
every week on the dot.

09:52.179 --> 09:56.016
-- I don't smoke...
-- You fuckin' do now, slag.

09:56.141 --> 09:58.811
There's no dolly mixtures
here, poofter.

09:58.894 --> 10:02.648
I'm the Daddy, and don't
you ever forget it, right?

10:03.774 --> 10:05.776
I said right?

10:22.293 --> 10:24.378
Pongo Banks, the Daddy.

10:24.503 --> 10:26.630
-- Yeah?
-- Yeah, Carlin.

10:26.755 --> 10:29.300
Your reputation
was ahead of you.

10:29.425 --> 10:32.720
You're gonna have
bother with that young man.

10:32.845 --> 10:37.766
When I came from Dover
that lot thought I was a nut.

10:37.892 --> 10:39.852
Violent, psycho, you know?

10:39.977 --> 10:44.690
So I give 'em this wild stare
and they give me no bother.

10:48.110 --> 10:50.946
Yes, I think
that'll do for today.

10:51.071 --> 10:53.824
Don't do yourself
no favours, mate.

10:53.949 --> 10:58.245
Carlin, I just wanna
get through my time my own way,

10:58.370 --> 11:02.291
causing as much fucking trouble
to the screws as possible

11:02.416 --> 11:05.377
in my own little way, OK?

11:08.631 --> 11:11.592
Oi. You watch yourself
with those pigs.

11:53.968 --> 11:56.428
-- Woods!
-- What?

11:56.554 --> 11:58.806
Over here and keep my seat warm.

12:40.222 --> 12:42.725
Stand up, coon. Name and number.

12:42.850 --> 12:45.853
Attention when I come in. Up!

12:45.978 --> 12:48.105
He said up, didn't he?!

13:17.384 --> 13:21.222
What's this, then?!
On your feet, lad!

13:21.347 --> 13:23.349
Name and number?!

13:23.474 --> 13:26.185
-- Angel, sir.
-- Number?

13:26.310 --> 13:28.270
Can't remember, sir.

13:28.395 --> 13:32.107
Can't remember? Your number,
lad, that's all you are!

13:32.233 --> 13:37.947
A number. Four digits.
That's all you are! 4736!

13:38.072 --> 13:39.532
Name and number?

13:39.657 --> 13:41.617
4736, Angel, sir.

13:41.742 --> 13:44.620
-- Who did this?
-- What, sir?

13:44.745 --> 13:47.706
-- Who did this?
-- Nobody, sir.

13:47.831 --> 13:50.626
-- No, sir.

13:50.751 --> 13:53.546
Damaging government property,
you black bastard?

13:53.671 --> 13:55.005
No, sir.

13:55.130 --> 13:58.300
-- What, then? You Brixton slag.
-- Nothing, sir.

13:58.425 --> 14:00.594
Booked for fighting.
Governor's report!

14:00.719 --> 14:02.680
-- I wasn't...
-- Right?!

14:02.805 --> 14:05.724
Hands by your side!
Name and number?

14:05.850 --> 14:07.935
4736, Angel, sir.

14:08.060 --> 14:12.314
-- Louder.
-- 4736, Angel, sir.

14:13.440 --> 14:16.277
Straight out
the banana trees, eh?

14:16.402 --> 14:18.779
Take it from me, nig--nog,

14:18.904 --> 14:23.784
steal white man's motor cars and
you give white man stick, right?

14:23.909 --> 14:27.371
-- Yes, sir.
-- Now, get this cell scrubbed.

14:27.496 --> 14:29.248
On the double!

15:00.529 --> 15:03.115
I'm older than
most trainees here.

15:03.240 --> 15:04.408
Yes.

15:04.533 --> 15:08.120
The books in the library
are either trash Westerns

15:08.245 --> 15:12.249
or hack adventure stories,
and I can't read that muck.

15:12.374 --> 15:16.420
Roy Rogers
or Nanook of the North?

15:16.545 --> 15:18.672
My needs are...different.

15:18.797 --> 15:22.551
The library caters for all
trainees here, not individuals.

15:22.676 --> 15:26.555
Besides censoring our mail
you also veto books sent?

15:26.680 --> 15:28.432
I do.

15:28.557 --> 15:31.977
Why haven't I been allowed
the two Dostoyevsky novels?

15:32.102 --> 15:35.147
They're safe. You'll have
them when you're released.

15:35.272 --> 15:38.859
-- I shan't need them then.
-- Matron.

15:38.984 --> 15:42.780
Have you read them?
They are classics.

15:42.905 --> 15:47.201
Archer, read them or not, Crime
and Punishment and The Idiot

15:47.326 --> 15:51.288
are hardly suitable for a young
boy in this establishment.

15:51.413 --> 15:53.415
-- Boy?
-- Trainee.

15:55.459 --> 15:57.878
Your feet are disgusting,
Archer.

15:58.003 --> 16:01.674
You're impudent and foolish.
Vegetarians don't eat meat,

16:01.799 --> 16:04.718
but that doesn't
stop them wearing shoes.

16:04.844 --> 16:08.347
Can't be very sincere people,
then, can they, Matron?

16:10.558 --> 16:13.269
It's gonna be resolved
soon, anyway.

16:13.394 --> 16:15.354
The feet and the diet.

16:15.479 --> 16:18.357
Yeah, I'm thinking
of becoming a Sikh.

16:18.482 --> 16:21.819
The Governor might have
something to say about that.

16:22.945 --> 16:27.992
Matron? Do you know what I used
to do with my girlfriend?

16:28.117 --> 16:30.911
Are you being insolent, Archer?

16:31.036 --> 16:34.123
Hold hands.
We used to hold hands.

16:38.252 --> 16:40.838
Er, yes, I think so.

16:40.963 --> 16:45.718
Yes. I keep getting
through the days somehow.

16:45.843 --> 16:49.638
You know, Matron,
when I was in the block,

16:49.763 --> 16:54.268
seven days solitary
down there. Madam.

16:54.393 --> 16:56.520
After much insistence,
they gave me,

16:56.645 --> 16:59.356
besides the bolting,
my right to a book.

16:59.481 --> 17:01.525
It was the Bible.

17:01.650 --> 17:04.319
You'll come
to no harm with that.

17:04.444 --> 17:07.031
It was printed in Yugoslavian,

17:07.156 --> 17:10.201
and there wasn't
an interpreter in the cell.

17:10.326 --> 17:14.579
Well, that only goes to show
that Christianity is universal.

17:16.999 --> 17:18.917
Make the report, Matron.

17:42.399 --> 17:45.194
Right, Carlin.
I run this fucking gaff.

17:45.319 --> 17:47.696
You're dead if you come it.

17:47.821 --> 17:52.076
Leave off. I don't give
a fuck who the Daddy is.

17:52.201 --> 17:56.455
Piss off and let me get on
with me time, all right?

17:56.580 --> 17:59.458
We'll give you time,
you bastard.

18:32.616 --> 18:34.243
Slasher?

18:34.368 --> 18:37.663
'Ere, look at this.
It's had a nightmare.

18:44.879 --> 18:47.715
There's more where that
come from, Carlin.

18:47.840 --> 18:51.594
You just keep
your fucking mouth closed.

18:51.719 --> 18:54.513
You ain't no Daddy here.

19:07.109 --> 19:08.903
Carlin!

19:10.029 --> 19:11.822
Yes, sir?

19:13.657 --> 19:15.618
What happened?

19:15.743 --> 19:17.703
-- Fell, sir.
-- Where? Quiet!

19:17.828 --> 19:19.622
Speak when I tell you!

19:19.747 --> 19:21.916
Somebody hit you, eh?

19:22.041 --> 19:24.877
-- Answer! Somebody hit you.
-- No, sir.

19:25.002 --> 19:27.838
We know about you.
Who was it?

19:27.963 --> 19:32.051
Fell, sir. Wasn't used
to the steps. Me own fault.

19:32.176 --> 19:35.221
I want none
of your tricks here.

19:35.346 --> 19:36.972
-- Understand?
-- Yes, sir.

19:37.097 --> 19:39.391
Any more and you're in trouble.

19:39.517 --> 19:41.644
-- Understand?
-- Yes, sir.

19:41.769 --> 19:43.979
Move, you little guttersnipe!

19:45.731 --> 19:48.025
You're on
Governor's report!

20:11.549 --> 20:14.343
-- 4568, Jackson, sir.
-- Late, Jackson?

20:14.468 --> 20:17.137
No, one surplus in the kitchen.

20:17.263 --> 20:20.099
Then get over there
and get shovelling.

20:26.313 --> 20:28.190
Oh, all over my hair!

20:28.315 --> 20:32.695
Quiet, Jackson. Or do we want
Mr Teasy--Weasy with you?

20:32.820 --> 20:35.531
I only washed it
last night, sir.

20:35.656 --> 20:37.825
You little poof.
Keep shovelling.

20:37.950 --> 20:40.327
-- Sir?

20:40.452 --> 20:44.290
-- Can I go to the toilet?
-- No. Keep shovelling.

20:44.415 --> 20:46.959
-- Sir, I'm bursting.
-- Keep shovelling.

20:52.256 --> 20:54.675
-- Woods?!
-- Yes, sir?

20:54.800 --> 20:56.844
What are you doing?

20:56.969 --> 20:58.929
What, sir?

20:59.054 --> 21:00.389
Oh, shovelling, sir.

21:00.514 --> 21:03.184
Then shovel it
in the barrow. Savvy?

21:03.309 --> 21:08.314
When we want it the other side
of the Channel we'll say, right?

21:08.439 --> 21:10.441
Yes, sir.

21:10.566 --> 21:15.654
Keep it moving, it's not
sand castles on Margate beach.

21:15.779 --> 21:19.408
Come on, Archer. No slacking
from you, you cabbage.

21:20.534 --> 21:23.370
Sometimes I somehow get
the strangest notion

21:23.495 --> 21:25.915
they're trying
to break my spirit.

21:26.040 --> 21:30.419
You're asking for it, mate.
Get some boots on your feet.

21:44.850 --> 21:46.810
What d'you want?

21:46.936 --> 21:50.648
Brought you my radio.
Borrow it till you get one.

21:50.773 --> 21:53.901
-- No, thanks.
-- Up to you, mate.

21:54.026 --> 21:59.365
Three of us got one. We ain't
gonna miss this one, are we?

21:59.490 --> 22:04.036
Let us have it back later
if you don't want it.

22:07.665 --> 22:11.794
"..Anyway, your dad will decide
and find homes for them.

22:11.919 --> 22:16.173
"You'll still have Bessie,
but we can't keep the pups

22:16.298 --> 22:19.552
"since we don't know
when you'll be home.

22:19.677 --> 22:22.972
"Hope this finds you
as it leaves us.

22:23.097 --> 22:27.059
"Let us know how you are,
and be good.

22:27.184 --> 22:30.938
"Have to dash to catch the post.
Love, Mum and Dad."

22:36.485 --> 22:39.405
They can't get rid of the pups.

22:39.530 --> 22:43.742
They'll hang on till
I can take care of 'em.

22:43.868 --> 22:48.289
I'll get a job,
then I can buy their grub.

22:48.414 --> 22:51.250
Will you write me
a letter back tonight, Ben?

22:51.375 --> 22:53.460
We'll see.

22:56.964 --> 23:00.134
Read it again, eh, Ben?
Just the once?

23:00.259 --> 23:03.262
-- Don't you go to classes?
-- Yeah.

23:03.387 --> 23:06.223
Haven't they taught
you to read?

23:06.348 --> 23:09.935
I can't understand
what they mean, you know,

23:10.060 --> 23:11.854
and I don't like asking.

23:11.979 --> 23:16.483
Just once more. I'll give
you some sweets on payday.

23:18.485 --> 23:20.696
Go on, Ben. Please.

23:27.786 --> 23:29.914
-- "Dear Donald..."
-- Ben?

23:30.039 --> 23:33.083
-- What?
-- You forgot the address.

23:37.880 --> 23:42.051
"3 Almeida Street,
Islington, London N1."

23:42.176 --> 23:44.178
All right?

23:45.304 --> 23:47.306
"Dear Donald..."

23:53.604 --> 23:55.564
On your feet, lad.

23:55.689 --> 23:57.691
4738, Davis, sir.

24:00.069 --> 24:02.071
Whose radio is this, Davis?

24:02.196 --> 24:04.865
-- Eckersley's, sir.
-- What's it doing here?

24:04.990 --> 24:07.952
-- He lent me it.
-- You've nicked it.

24:08.077 --> 24:10.746
-- No, sir...
-- You nicked it, don't bullshit.

24:10.829 --> 24:12.665
He brought it, sir.

24:12.790 --> 24:17.253
Eckersley has reported his radio
missing, and here it is.

24:17.378 --> 24:19.922
You're on Governor's report.

24:41.902 --> 24:43.988
Twat.

24:55.791 --> 24:59.295
Tell the Governor
he lent it to you.

24:59.420 --> 25:01.755
You'll get time on the block.

25:01.881 --> 25:03.883
So don't antagonise the bastard.

25:04.008 --> 25:07.094
-- It's not fair, though.
-- You listening, Archer?

25:07.219 --> 25:10.639
-- Yeah. I dunno what it means.
-- Bleedin' fair?

25:10.764 --> 25:13.934
-- You do time in the block?
-- No.

25:14.059 --> 25:16.437
Well, you're gonna get it here.

25:16.562 --> 25:18.522
So keep your mouth shut.

25:18.647 --> 25:21.984
Cause trouble,
and they'll bolt you,

25:22.109 --> 25:25.863
and you won't stand a lot
of their bastard handouts.

25:25.988 --> 25:28.824
Watch Tasty Reg there.
He's a winner.

25:28.949 --> 25:32.286
Fully--fledged humanitarian
with a BA in Hatred.

25:38.083 --> 25:40.794
Morning, Mr White.
Morning, Mr Whittle.

25:40.920 --> 25:43.923
-- Everything looks fine.
-- Thank you, sir.

26:07.571 --> 26:10.616
-- Fine, Mr White. Excellent.
-- Thank you, sir.

26:22.503 --> 26:24.505
-- Morning, Reg.
-- Morning, sir.

26:27.091 --> 26:30.094
-- Name and number.
-- 4321, Pertier, sir.

26:30.219 --> 26:32.721
-- All right, Pertier?
-- Yes, sir.

26:32.847 --> 26:35.808
-- Name and number.
-- 3936, Kabiers, sir.

26:35.933 --> 26:38.727
-- All right, Kabiers?
-- Yes, sir.

26:38.853 --> 26:41.730
-- Name and number.
-- 4511, Chambers, sir.

26:41.856 --> 26:44.358
-- All right, Chambers?
-- Yes, sir.

26:44.483 --> 26:47.319
-- Name and number.
-- 4527, Smith, sir.

26:47.444 --> 26:49.947
-- All right, Smith?
-- Yes, sir.

26:50.072 --> 26:52.908
-- Name and number.
-- 4396, James, sir.

26:53.033 --> 26:55.536
-- All right, James?
-- Yes, sir.

26:58.330 --> 27:00.541
-- Morning, sir.
-- Morning.

27:03.794 --> 27:08.299
Apart from absconding,
your record was clean, Davis,

27:08.424 --> 27:11.760
and I have taken that
into consideration.

27:11.886 --> 27:15.139
However, if I deal
with you leniently here

27:15.264 --> 27:18.934
it will not be light
should you appear again.

27:19.059 --> 27:21.020
C of E, are we?

27:21.145 --> 27:23.856
-- Answer the Governor.
-- Pardon, sir?

27:23.981 --> 27:26.734
-- Church of England?
-- Yes, sir.

27:26.859 --> 27:32.406
Good. Three days in the block.
Loss of privileges for one week.

27:33.532 --> 27:36.076
About turn, quick march. Out!

27:36.202 --> 27:38.204
You. In.

27:38.329 --> 27:41.624
Feet on the mat, legs apart,
face the Governor.

27:41.749 --> 27:45.252
-- Name and number.
-- 4737, Carlin, sir.

27:47.087 --> 27:49.089
Fighting, Carlin.

27:50.758 --> 27:52.468
Oh, yes. Yes.

27:52.593 --> 27:55.721
Now then, Carlin,
you were transferred to me

27:55.846 --> 27:58.390
because you assaulted
an officer.

27:58.516 --> 28:02.144
Heaven knows what they
expect me to do with you.

28:02.269 --> 28:05.731
However, I will have
no violence in this institution.

28:05.856 --> 28:07.733
There is no violence here.

28:07.858 --> 28:10.569
-- Do you understand me?
-- Yes, sir.

28:10.694 --> 28:14.281
Yet no sooner are you settled
then the marks are visible.

28:14.406 --> 28:19.954
I'm a generous man, but I will
not let trainees take liberties.

28:20.079 --> 28:24.208
If you are here again
you will be in serious trouble.

28:24.333 --> 28:26.669
-- Do you understand?
-- Yes, sir.

28:26.794 --> 28:30.256
-- Have you anything to say?
-- Not really, sir.

28:30.381 --> 28:33.050
Except I wasn't
fighting, I fell.

28:33.175 --> 28:38.514
I understand the officer thought
I had by the state of my face.

28:38.639 --> 28:41.600
I mean,
what else could he think?

28:41.725 --> 28:46.480
-- C of E, are we?
-- Yes, it's a great comfort.

28:46.605 --> 28:50.943
Good. It may even have some
guidance for your reform.

28:51.068 --> 28:56.949
Three days solitary.
Loss of earnings for two weeks.

28:57.074 --> 29:00.703
-- About turn! Out!
-- Move it, Carlin, move it!

29:00.828 --> 29:04.540
-- Pick your feet up!
-- Move it, double! Double!

29:19.638 --> 29:21.599
-- Meakin?
-- Sir?

29:21.724 --> 29:23.517
Visitor.

30:24.620 --> 30:27.164
None of the lads'll
wear it, Banks.

30:27.289 --> 30:30.125
They gonna walk about
with pound notes?

30:30.251 --> 30:32.461
Pound notes
aren't allowed, Dougan.

30:32.586 --> 30:36.924
There's stiff penalties
for anything but small change.

30:37.049 --> 30:41.345
And very stiff penalties for
anybody undercutting my rate.

30:41.470 --> 30:44.765
You make sure certain parties
know that, Dougan.

30:46.225 --> 30:48.435
Right, come on, Dougan.

30:54.859 --> 30:58.112
Now then, that's eight quid
altogether, right?

30:58.237 --> 31:01.907
I get 70 pence for a quid
from the screw, right?

31:02.032 --> 31:05.119
Your cut's five pence
and mine's 15.

31:05.244 --> 31:07.496
That leaves 50 pence.

31:07.621 --> 31:09.832
50 pence for a quid.

31:09.957 --> 31:12.334
I got fuckin' overheads,
haven't I?

31:12.459 --> 31:14.795
Haven't those bastards
heard of inflation?

31:14.920 --> 31:19.175
Give 'em 50, they don't
like it they can see me.

31:19.300 --> 31:20.676
Screw.

31:23.387 --> 31:26.432
I'm granting your request
to marry, Betts.

31:26.557 --> 31:31.437
I hope this induces you to
work hard and leave here soon.

31:31.562 --> 31:33.898
It all depends on you.

31:34.023 --> 31:39.195
One month hence, released
for four hours under escort,

31:39.320 --> 31:41.530
to marry.

31:43.699 --> 31:46.911
-- Right, Betts?
-- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

31:47.036 --> 31:50.331
This causes no little
inconvenience, Betts.

31:50.456 --> 31:53.626
It costs the taxpayer,
and I'm not pleased

31:53.751 --> 31:56.170
you're marrying
in a registry office.

31:56.295 --> 32:00.549
We're gonna have a proper
church do when I get out.

32:00.674 --> 32:05.429
Hmm, let's hope you're released
before the child is born.

32:05.554 --> 32:07.515
Yes, sir.

32:07.640 --> 32:10.476
See you don't misplace
my trust, Betts.

32:10.601 --> 32:14.522
-- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
-- Right, out you go.

32:14.647 --> 32:18.192
About turn, quick march.
Move it, Betts.

32:20.069 --> 32:22.029
Registry office.

32:22.154 --> 32:24.156
Archer? In.

32:29.495 --> 32:31.455
Name and number.

32:31.580 --> 32:34.375
4721, Archer, sir.

32:34.500 --> 32:37.670
Ahh, Archer.

32:37.795 --> 32:39.755
Still vegetarian, are we?

32:39.880 --> 32:43.133
-- Yes, sir.
-- And still barefoot?

32:43.259 --> 32:44.301
Yes, sir.

32:44.426 --> 32:48.305
Well, we have every respect for
others' sincere beliefs here.

32:48.430 --> 32:53.269
And at a little expense we have
procured plastic boots for you.

32:53.394 --> 32:55.813
-- Do you appreciate that?
-- Yes, sir.

32:55.938 --> 32:58.607
No objection to plastic?

32:58.691 --> 33:00.651
-- No, sir.
-- Good.

33:00.776 --> 33:06.156
I hope the co--operation
will be reciprocated. Indeed.

33:08.033 --> 33:12.788
Have you read The Life
of St. Francis of Assisi?

33:12.913 --> 33:17.501
No, sir. Though I'm sure
it's a most engrossing epistle.

33:17.626 --> 33:19.587
It is.

33:19.712 --> 33:23.382
The son of a wealthy man,
he converted to Christianity,

33:23.507 --> 33:26.802
to commit himself
to the life of the Gospel.

33:26.927 --> 33:28.888
You should read it.

33:29.013 --> 33:34.643
I wanted to mention access
to literature to you, sir.

33:34.768 --> 33:38.063
You see, I'm finding myself...

33:38.189 --> 33:41.609
strongly drawn to Mecca, sir.

33:41.734 --> 33:44.320
Very strongly indeed.

33:45.654 --> 33:46.822
Mecca, Archer?!

33:46.947 --> 33:51.202
Yes, sir. It's...something
stirring within me, sir.

33:51.327 --> 33:54.246
I'm sure you understand
what I mean, sir?

33:54.371 --> 33:57.625
Archer, you will see
the chaplain tomorrow.

33:57.750 --> 34:02.004
I'm an atheist, sir. It's on my
record. Atheist and vegetarian.

34:02.129 --> 34:05.049
You told them
you were Christ at Dover.

34:05.174 --> 34:08.092
There will be
no more talk of Mecca!

34:08.219 --> 34:11.263
Get him issued with the boots.

34:11.388 --> 34:14.891
About turn, quick march.
Move it, Archer.

34:15.016 --> 34:17.018
Feet up, lad!

34:17.143 --> 34:19.103
Come on! Move, move!

34:19.230 --> 34:21.732
Come on, you bastards, move!

34:21.857 --> 34:23.859
Face the front, Angel!

34:24.985 --> 34:30.324
Get in line, Davis.
Come on, pick those feet up!

34:30.449 --> 34:33.953
Enjoy our little holiday? Good.

34:34.078 --> 34:36.496
Whenever you feel like a break

34:36.621 --> 34:40.708
it's always there,
at your disposal.

34:40.835 --> 34:42.795
-- Right, Carlin?
-- Yes, sir!

34:42.920 --> 34:45.755
Gear in your rooms
and straight to ablutions.

34:45.880 --> 34:48.759
I want work out of you toerags.

34:48.884 --> 34:52.888
Now, move!
Pick those feet up! Double up!

35:09.405 --> 35:11.407
Out!

35:49.320 --> 35:52.323
Right, what shall we talk about?

35:55.326 --> 35:57.328
Any problems?

35:58.454 --> 36:00.915
Come along,
that's what I'm here for.

36:05.669 --> 36:08.631
Why am I so far from home,
Matron?

36:08.756 --> 36:12.718
-- 'Cause you murdered that kid.
-- All right, Eckersley.

36:15.054 --> 36:18.390
Formby, I'm forever
explaining this. Let it sink in.

36:18.516 --> 36:21.519
He's 14 years old. 14.

36:21.644 --> 36:23.521
Quiet, Archer.

36:23.646 --> 36:26.023
I never get a visitor.

36:26.148 --> 36:27.858
That is unfortunate, Formby,

36:27.983 --> 36:32.321
but you have to be detained
during Her Majesty's pleasure.

36:32.446 --> 36:36.367
As there are no special places
for boys like yourself,

36:36.492 --> 36:38.536
you have to remain here.

36:38.661 --> 36:42.206
Here you have the opportunity
to learn and to improve.

36:42.331 --> 36:46.794
If you behave and apply yourself
willingly and to the rules

36:46.919 --> 36:49.588
there may be every chance
that Her Majesty,

36:49.672 --> 36:51.632
or one of her representatives,

36:51.757 --> 36:57.012
may consider your release
much earlier than you imagine.

36:57.137 --> 36:59.098
Much earlier than what, Matron?

37:00.224 --> 37:03.853
Meanwhile, try to remember
that you are more fortunate

37:03.978 --> 37:08.566
than boys similar to yourself,
who are held at Wormwood Scrubs

37:08.691 --> 37:11.694
until they're old enough
to transfer to prison.

37:11.819 --> 37:13.153
All right?

37:16.365 --> 37:18.325
My dog had three puppies.

37:18.450 --> 37:20.619
Three. It's in my letter.

37:20.744 --> 37:24.623
Yes, I read it, Woods.
That is good news, isn't it?

37:24.748 --> 37:27.710
-- Where are you going, Meakin?
-- Out.

37:27.835 --> 37:30.796
-- Out, what?
-- Out, Matron.

37:30.921 --> 37:33.090
Sit down, please, Meakin.

37:40.139 --> 37:43.475
-- Everything all right, Toyne?
-- Yeah, fine, Matron.

37:43.601 --> 37:45.644
Good. Good.

37:49.523 --> 37:51.525
Anything else?

37:55.321 --> 37:57.072
Trust.

37:57.198 --> 37:58.949
Pardon, Archer?

37:59.074 --> 38:04.121
I'd like to suggest a discussion
on the nature of trust.

38:04.246 --> 38:08.000
Are you sure that's not
a matter for your House Master?

38:08.125 --> 38:11.754
But you see, Matron,
we are continually bombarded

38:11.879 --> 38:13.756
with instructions to trust.

38:13.881 --> 38:17.343
Yet at the same time
we are continuously informed

38:17.468 --> 38:19.887
that we are completely
untrustworthy.

38:20.012 --> 38:22.973
So perhaps it might
be of some benefit

38:23.098 --> 38:27.895
if we were to openly
discuss the nature of trust

38:28.020 --> 38:31.524
and explore areas where
such a valuable commodity

38:31.649 --> 38:38.197
may be nurtured,
and not stifled or eroded.

38:40.658 --> 38:45.246
Does anyone want to continue the
discussion suggested by Archer?

38:50.417 --> 38:52.586
-- Matron?
-- Yes, Meakin?

38:52.711 --> 38:57.299
Is there a chance of you calling
us by our Christian names?

38:57.424 --> 39:02.012
I mean, it's the only reminder
of our identities we have left.

39:02.137 --> 39:05.891
My own feelings on that subject
don't enter into it.

39:06.016 --> 39:09.478
I'm bound by Home Office rules,
as you are.

39:09.603 --> 39:13.357
So whatever I may personally
feel, that is the rule,

39:13.482 --> 39:17.570
and we're all here
to learn to obey.

39:17.695 --> 39:22.157
So, thank you all for coming.
Next week, same time.

39:22.283 --> 39:26.370
And if you have any problems,
don't hesitate to come to me.

39:26.495 --> 39:30.040
If I can't help,
I know Mr Goodyear will.

40:07.369 --> 40:09.163
Carry on.

40:19.882 --> 40:21.884
Ah! Leave it out, Stripey!

40:22.009 --> 40:24.970
-- You're in my bleedin' way!
-- Oi!

40:25.095 --> 40:27.056
It's all right, Ben.

40:27.181 --> 40:30.976
What's up with you, weirdo?
You want stripin'?

40:31.101 --> 40:35.731
You might get left alone here,
but I'll cut you to ribbons

40:35.856 --> 40:38.567
if I get any of your poxy lip.

40:41.654 --> 40:43.697
Back, grass!

40:43.822 --> 40:46.408
I said, get back, shithead.

41:05.135 --> 41:07.137
Well, carry on.

41:45.551 --> 41:47.511
Right, Banks, you bastard!

41:47.636 --> 41:51.515
I'm the Daddy now! Next time,
I'll fucking kill you!

42:01.192 --> 42:03.068
Who was it, Richards?

42:03.194 --> 42:05.779
-- Carlin? The coon?
-- I slipped, sir.

42:05.905 --> 42:08.115
I'll give you fucking slipped.

42:09.909 --> 42:12.161
Right, on your feet!

42:12.286 --> 42:13.746
Who did this?!

42:15.581 --> 42:17.541
Come on! Who did it?!

42:20.503 --> 42:23.756
-- Where's Banks?
-- Don't know...

42:31.472 --> 42:35.392
Dozy bastard, Banks. You let
him do you over, you twat!

42:35.518 --> 42:37.478
I slipped, sir.

42:38.646 --> 42:41.023
Who d'you think
you're talking to?

42:41.148 --> 42:44.401
Carlin! I want you
to name Carlin!

42:44.527 --> 42:46.487
I slipped, sir.

42:55.621 --> 42:58.791
Carlin! Carlin!

43:01.252 --> 43:03.045
Sir?

43:07.258 --> 43:10.803
OK, Carlin. You're really
for it this time.

43:10.928 --> 43:13.264
Banks and Richards
have named you.

43:13.389 --> 43:16.141
You'll get three years
for this, scum.

43:16.267 --> 43:17.685
What, sir?

43:17.810 --> 43:19.895
You fuckin' well know, toerag.

43:20.020 --> 43:21.981
I run this wing.

43:22.106 --> 43:26.068
I'm not having it disrupted by
a backstreet villain like you.

43:26.193 --> 43:28.153
You'll sign a statement
downstairs.

43:28.279 --> 43:30.739
I'd like to see
the House Master.

43:30.865 --> 43:32.908
You will, Carlin, you will.

43:33.033 --> 43:35.828
And the Governor, sir.
I've got a witness.

43:35.953 --> 43:38.914
Shit, witness.
I'm havin' you, lad.

43:39.039 --> 43:41.375
You banged that officer at Roly.

43:41.500 --> 43:44.712
You thought you walked
quietly away from that.

43:44.837 --> 43:48.340
But he's here. He's me.

43:48.465 --> 43:52.970
He's every fucking screw in
this borstal. Every one of us.

43:53.095 --> 43:58.058
Come on. Fancy taking a poke
at me? Come on, big man.

43:58.184 --> 44:03.189
I retaliated. Two of 'em
was kicking shit out of me.

44:03.314 --> 44:05.441
Well, retaliate here.

44:07.401 --> 44:09.236
Come on!

44:18.704 --> 44:20.748
I'll have you.

44:43.604 --> 44:45.606
Where's Carlin?

44:55.324 --> 44:57.409
-- Carlin?
-- What?

44:57.535 --> 44:59.995
Baldy, the Daddy from D Wing.

45:00.120 --> 45:03.165
-- He wants to meet.
-- I don't talk.

45:03.290 --> 45:06.460
He wants to meet.
We know what for.

45:06.585 --> 45:09.296
He's a hard nut.
When's it gonna be?

45:09.421 --> 45:11.549
I'll find him.

45:14.093 --> 45:17.763
You tell him, Dougan,
he's a black bastard, right?

45:17.888 --> 45:19.890
He knows.

45:28.065 --> 45:30.109
Rather warm, don't you think?

45:30.234 --> 45:33.529
Yeah. Won't be
in this sweatbox much longer.

45:33.654 --> 45:37.783
It's all right for coons,
but it's no good to me.

45:37.908 --> 45:41.078
All this for nicking
30 bob of junk.

45:41.203 --> 45:44.331
-- You're joking?
-- 30 bob of fucking scrap.

45:44.456 --> 45:48.836
Me brother had some form
so they stuck it on me.

45:48.961 --> 45:52.882
-- Jesus. One for the book.
-- What d'you do? A bank?

45:53.007 --> 45:58.345
No, I was trying to further
a career as a timber merchant.

45:58.470 --> 46:00.806
Clerk. My old lady was sick,

46:00.931 --> 46:05.811
and there was all this stick
about giving her a bad time

46:05.936 --> 46:09.481
and her wanting to see me
secure and respectable.

46:09.607 --> 46:11.483
You know, all that shit.

46:11.609 --> 46:16.405
I was in this office, but got
too ambitious, didn't I?

46:16.530 --> 46:19.742
Wasn't satisfied with me
fingers in the petty cash.

46:19.867 --> 46:23.787
Started on the cash sales.
40, 50 quid, most weeks.

46:23.913 --> 46:26.040
Going to work in a cab.

46:26.165 --> 46:29.335
Till some hard--faced mare
comes back and...

46:29.460 --> 46:31.420
Here I am.

46:31.545 --> 46:34.548
-- First offence?
-- You know my mouth.

46:34.673 --> 46:40.638
Gave the judge a bit of lip,
she packs me off to borstal.

46:51.857 --> 46:54.068
40 pence a quid, that's it.

46:54.193 --> 46:57.279
I can't, Carlin,
they'll cut my throat.

46:57.404 --> 47:00.282
That's the way
things are now, mate.

47:00.407 --> 47:02.952
40p. That or nothing.

47:03.077 --> 47:07.498
The whole bleedin' nick'll
be onto you. Right behind Baldy.

47:07.623 --> 47:13.838
Fuck 'em. If Banks paid 50
I've gotta give less.

47:13.963 --> 47:18.467
Psychology. If I wanna keep hold
I've gotta be harder than him,

47:18.592 --> 47:21.303
or you'll have
someone paying 60.

47:21.428 --> 47:26.475
40's way under. It won't be
worth the risk getting money in.

47:31.397 --> 47:33.566
OK, 45. They get 45.

47:33.691 --> 47:38.070
But I want it made clear,
Dougan, it's a favour.

47:38.195 --> 47:41.490
-- You had to beg me.
-- OK.

47:41.615 --> 47:43.909
-- You had to plead!
-- Right.

47:44.034 --> 47:46.245
-- Carlin!
-- Sir?

47:46.370 --> 47:49.081
-- Mr Goodyear's office.
-- Yes, sir.

47:53.294 --> 47:55.254
Dougan, Association.

47:55.379 --> 47:58.841
-- Yes, sir.
-- I don't want you in here.

48:05.431 --> 48:09.059
It's one of the most rewarding
aspects of this job,

48:09.185 --> 48:13.105
encouraging ability
and individuality.

48:13.230 --> 48:17.359
And a consequence of this
is that natural leaders emerge.

48:17.484 --> 48:19.945
As they have throughout history.

48:20.070 --> 48:24.408
But, Carlin,
as I am sure you are aware,

48:24.533 --> 48:28.954
the gift of leadership
entails responsibilities,

48:29.079 --> 48:33.459
like setting a good example
and keeping order.

48:33.584 --> 48:38.547
Leadership means order.
Do you understand that?

48:38.672 --> 48:40.925
-- Yes, sir.
-- Good.

48:41.050 --> 48:45.763
Now then, you came here
with a bad reputation,

48:45.888 --> 48:49.892
but I am prepared
to take you as I find you.

48:50.017 --> 48:54.021
You'll have every chance to
prove yourself on this wing,

48:54.146 --> 48:58.526
and even to win back
some of the time you've lost

48:58.651 --> 49:00.945
through your more
unfortunate escapades.

49:01.070 --> 49:07.868
As House Master I run this wing.
I want that firmly understood.

49:07.993 --> 49:11.288
Nobody rocks my boat.

49:11.413 --> 49:13.624
Do we understand each other?

49:13.749 --> 49:16.418
Yes, sir.

49:16.502 --> 49:20.673
-- Very well, then.
-- Just one thing, sir.

49:20.798 --> 49:21.757
Yes?

49:21.882 --> 49:24.343
I would like a single cell.

49:24.468 --> 49:27.137
I think we can arrange that,
Mr Greaves?

49:27.263 --> 49:29.807
-- Yes, sir!
-- Anything else?

49:30.975 --> 49:34.728
-- No, sir.
-- About turn! Move!

49:39.650 --> 49:41.610
In you go, Woods.

49:41.735 --> 49:43.529
Carlin?

49:56.458 --> 50:00.296
All right, Carlin.
But don't push it.

50:00.421 --> 50:04.091
If there's any bother,
we'll have your bleedin' guts.

50:04.216 --> 50:05.968
Right?

50:06.093 --> 50:08.137
I said, right?

50:09.889 --> 50:11.891
Yes, sir.

50:12.016 --> 50:14.018
On your way.

50:29.116 --> 50:31.202
..three, she had, three puppies.

50:31.327 --> 50:34.371
Mum doesn't think
she can afford them,

50:34.496 --> 50:38.876
and if they can't wait
for me to get out...

50:39.001 --> 50:43.589
I was wondering if you'd like
one, sir. It wouldn't cost.

50:43.714 --> 50:45.674
-- Woods.
-- Yes, sir?

50:45.799 --> 50:49.553
You were not brought here
to discuss your dog.

50:49.678 --> 50:53.098
-- No, sir, but...
-- Quiet, Woods!

50:53.224 --> 50:58.479
I've brought you here to inform
you you aren't up to scratch.

50:58.604 --> 51:02.900
Your room is dirty.
Your clothing dishevelled.

51:03.025 --> 51:06.570
The reports from
your classes are appalling.

51:06.695 --> 51:10.157
The list grows,
and I am warning you,

51:10.282 --> 51:14.828
unless there is a marked
improvement in the near future

51:14.954 --> 51:17.623
you will be in serious trouble.

51:17.706 --> 51:19.667
I do my best, sir.

51:19.792 --> 51:22.002
It's not good enough, Woods.

51:22.127 --> 51:24.463
I always seem to be behind, sir.

51:24.588 --> 51:27.842
Then do as you're told, lad!

51:27.967 --> 51:33.681
You don't have to think for
yourself here, it's all laid on.

51:33.806 --> 51:40.980
Forget all this juvenile puppy
business and get down to it.

51:41.105 --> 51:44.316
I don't want
to see you again, right?

51:44.441 --> 51:46.861
Sir.

51:46.986 --> 51:53.617
No, no, come on.
This isn't racial. It's a game.

51:53.742 --> 51:57.496
Right! A Wing this end,
B Wing that end. Move!

52:02.877 --> 52:03.794
Rules.

52:03.919 --> 52:09.884
No punching in the face.
No kicking in the goolies.

52:10.009 --> 52:12.011
And no biting.

52:16.807 --> 52:20.728
-- Give me that back, bastard!
-- Get it down here!

52:20.853 --> 52:26.192
-- Out my way, black bastard!
-- Hit him in the bollocks!

52:26.275 --> 52:28.235
Push the poof, you cunt!

52:28.360 --> 52:30.571
Come on, get the ball moving!

52:30.696 --> 52:33.741
-- Come on, boys, get 'em!
-- Eckersley!

52:33.866 --> 52:38.370
-- Don't just stand about!
-- Move the fucking ball!

52:40.664 --> 52:44.001
-- Get hold of 'em!
-- Kill the bastards!

52:46.337 --> 52:49.340
-- Stick the boot in!
-- Move!

52:50.257 --> 52:52.551
Kill him!

52:59.934 --> 53:04.063
-- Fucking black bastard!
-- Push it up there!

53:05.231 --> 53:07.650
-- I told you!
-- Fuckin' jungle bunnies!

53:08.817 --> 53:13.781
-- Fuck off!
-- Get back! Get back!

53:13.906 --> 53:16.700
-- Black...
-- Bastard!

53:27.628 --> 53:29.797
Hello, Toyne. What is it?

53:32.800 --> 53:37.012
-- Come on, what is it?
-- This. It came today.

53:37.137 --> 53:39.682
-- I know.
-- Will you read it?

53:39.807 --> 53:42.518
-- I have already.
-- Read it again.

53:50.401 --> 53:53.612
"Dear Ronald,
sorry we have not wrote

53:53.737 --> 53:55.906
"but things have been busy.

53:56.031 --> 54:00.077
"Anyway, Candy died last week
and we buried her.

54:00.202 --> 54:05.249
"She looked very peaceful and
we thought you should know this.

54:05.374 --> 54:08.669
"Have to dash, good luck.
George and Bet."

54:12.423 --> 54:16.552
Well, Toyne, somebody's pet?
Dog? Budgie?

54:18.846 --> 54:20.848
My wife.

54:20.973 --> 54:23.809
Candy was my nickname
for my wife.

55:03.724 --> 55:07.353
-- No strings?
-- Get it down you, sharpish.

55:13.192 --> 55:15.444
Vegetarians, I've shit 'em.

55:23.494 --> 55:26.872
Carlin? That old Baldy says
the boilerhouse, tomorrow.

55:26.997 --> 55:30.668
There'll be a whole crowd
of us there shovellin'.

55:30.793 --> 55:34.088
He says just you and him,
all right?

55:40.135 --> 55:42.596
Come on, Davis. Move it!

57:11.644 --> 57:14.980
This fuckin' tool!
D'you want some more?

57:15.105 --> 57:16.774
Leave it out, man.

57:16.899 --> 57:19.276
Now, I'm gonna tell you once.

57:19.401 --> 57:21.779
Just once.

57:21.904 --> 57:24.865
-- You listenin' to me, coon?
-- Yeah.

57:24.990 --> 57:27.952
-- You run B Wing.
-- Right.

57:28.077 --> 57:32.414
All right. But for me.
I give the orders.

57:32.540 --> 57:34.542
-- Right?
-- Ahh! Yeah.

57:34.667 --> 57:39.797
You'll get your perks,
but I'm the Daddy. Right?

57:39.922 --> 57:43.133
Yeah. Uhh...uhh.

57:47.012 --> 57:51.308
You get some coal dust rubbed on
those marks, you black bastard.

58:35.769 --> 58:39.690
All right, get on with it.
We haven't got all day.

58:56.874 --> 58:58.834
Right, lads.

58:58.959 --> 59:01.170
[All sing Here Comes the Bride]

59:12.097 --> 59:14.391
Get the bride. Get the bride!

59:18.437 --> 59:22.483
..you like it if someone touched
your wife up? All right.

59:22.608 --> 59:26.529
I now pronounce you man and
wife. You can shag the bride.

59:34.245 --> 59:37.039
I'm not marrying
a fucking coon, anyway.

59:37.164 --> 59:40.751
-- All right! All right!
-- That's enough!

59:40.876 --> 59:42.920
Let's have some order!

59:43.045 --> 59:45.214
Get back into Association.

59:45.339 --> 59:48.634
Betts, up to your room
and get changed.

59:48.759 --> 59:50.553
Move it!

59:52.429 --> 59:54.431
Come on, lad!

59:59.061 --> 01:00:03.357
What a weddin' night. They
can even fuck that up in here.

01:00:05.192 --> 01:00:07.987
Come on, Toyne,
you're allowed some fun.

01:00:08.112 --> 01:00:10.531
No good standing there
moping, lad.

01:00:37.308 --> 01:00:39.310
-- Archer.
-- Sir?

01:00:54.033 --> 01:00:56.785
Thanks, Mr Duke.

01:00:56.911 --> 01:01:00.539
-- It won't happen again.
-- Oh, that's lovely.

01:01:23.729 --> 01:01:25.731
And yours?

01:01:29.485 --> 01:01:32.238
You might
be a smartarse, Archer,

01:01:32.363 --> 01:01:34.657
but you're a fool to yourself.

01:01:34.782 --> 01:01:36.742
I get by.

01:01:36.867 --> 01:01:39.870
You'll do the full stretch,
d'you know that?

01:01:39.995 --> 01:01:44.375
Well, they're not
having me, Mr Duke.

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:47.294
I gotta save myself,
despite whatever methods

01:01:47.419 --> 01:01:49.755
you bastards devise
to destroy me.

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:52.925
I'll get through. Or...I won't.

01:01:53.050 --> 01:01:55.010
But it's my way.

01:01:55.135 --> 01:01:57.096
Less lip, Archer.

01:01:57.221 --> 01:01:59.181
I won't have insolence.

01:01:59.306 --> 01:02:02.768
Talk's one thing, but I will
not tolerate insolence.

01:02:02.893 --> 01:02:05.187
-- Right, lad?
-- Right, sir.

01:02:11.277 --> 01:02:14.572
Look at you sitting there
with that daft smile.

01:02:14.697 --> 01:02:17.658
Why aren't you
with the rest of them?

01:02:17.783 --> 01:02:19.743
I'm an atheist.

01:02:19.869 --> 01:02:22.538
What d'you think
that lot are, disciples?

01:02:23.664 --> 01:02:28.419
Every Sunday there's an officer
allocated to watch you.

01:02:28.544 --> 01:02:33.048
Because you're too pig--headed to
sit in chapel for half an hour.

01:02:34.175 --> 01:02:39.513
And every Sunday that's
that little bit more you owe us.

01:02:39.597 --> 01:02:41.932
You know what the boss is like.

01:02:42.057 --> 01:02:45.227
You're committing
a mortal sin sitting here.

01:02:45.352 --> 01:02:49.064
They're all atheists,
but they don't put it about.

01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:52.568
I did hear you were thinking
of turning Indian.

01:02:52.693 --> 01:02:55.362
I think about
all sorts of things.

01:02:55.487 --> 01:02:58.616
Haven't you seen
enough of them in here?

01:02:58.741 --> 01:03:01.994
Keep your nose clean
and get out.

01:03:02.119 --> 01:03:06.540
Boredom. Nah, never
was much good at that.

01:03:06.665 --> 01:03:10.294
Pass the time quietly.

01:03:10.419 --> 01:03:12.963
You don't hear me moaning, eh?

01:03:13.088 --> 01:03:15.633
I smile. I smile a lot.

01:03:15.758 --> 01:03:18.052
You're loose in the head, lad.

01:03:19.345 --> 01:03:22.431
You know when
I was in the Scrubs?

01:03:22.556 --> 01:03:25.559
Sweating it out

01:03:25.684 --> 01:03:29.063
I had this matchbox,
and it said,

01:03:29.188 --> 01:03:33.442
"It takes 60 muscles to frown,
but only 13 to smile,

01:03:33.567 --> 01:03:35.528
"so why waste energy?"

01:03:35.653 --> 01:03:39.782
You see, I'm doing
me time in a matchbox.

01:03:39.907 --> 01:03:41.909
Jesus Christ.

01:03:44.119 --> 01:03:48.040
Do nothing in here,
do you, eh? Nothing.

01:03:48.165 --> 01:03:50.876
When I was out
I reminded myself,

01:03:51.001 --> 01:03:54.129
you can take something good
from every experience.

01:03:54.255 --> 01:03:57.383
All I'll take
from borstal is evil.

01:03:57.508 --> 01:04:00.970
Because you don't
bloody toe the line.

01:04:01.095 --> 01:04:05.140
No, it's not that, Mr Duke.
You take Mr Goodyear.

01:04:05.266 --> 01:04:08.519
He rattles out bullshit
about character building

01:04:08.644 --> 01:04:13.232
morning, noon, and night.
That's impossible, it's not on.

01:04:13.357 --> 01:04:19.613
How can you build character in
a regime based on deprivation?

01:04:19.738 --> 01:04:21.949
It's a one--way contamination.

01:04:22.074 --> 01:04:25.619
Good fine minds thrown in
with crazy perverted people.

01:04:25.744 --> 01:04:27.538
What am I doing here?

01:04:27.663 --> 01:04:31.667
Why aren't I on another wing
with somebody to talk to?

01:04:31.792 --> 01:04:35.838
Where I could be civilised? I'm
always looking over me shoulder.

01:04:35.963 --> 01:04:39.300
If it's not a screw it's a con.

01:04:39.425 --> 01:04:43.179
Why didn't they send
me to an open nick?

01:04:43.304 --> 01:04:45.890
You're too old for this lot.

01:04:46.015 --> 01:04:49.268
They should've given
you a prison sentence.

01:04:49.393 --> 01:04:52.313
Right. Right.

01:04:52.438 --> 01:04:55.774
I was happier in prison.

01:04:55.900 --> 01:05:01.113
I finish my time with a bunch
of snotty young hooligans.

01:05:01.238 --> 01:05:04.074
Two years of this
before I retire.

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:07.203
-- How long you done?
-- A long time.

01:05:07.328 --> 01:05:09.496
That's a hefty sentence.

01:05:09.622 --> 01:05:11.999
One way or another in prisons.

01:05:12.124 --> 01:05:14.335
Public service, Archer.

01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:18.005
Haven't you realised
some of them like being here?

01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:20.591
It's called institutionalised.

01:05:20.716 --> 01:05:23.886
-- They're secure.
-- Are they that...?

01:05:24.011 --> 01:05:28.390
In here you act,
you're punished and you're free.

01:05:28.516 --> 01:05:32.770
Out there, you act, you're
punished by your own guilt,

01:05:32.895 --> 01:05:34.855
and you're never free.

01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:37.566
What little book is that from?

01:05:37.691 --> 01:05:39.735
This one.

01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:42.655
Certainly not
from what's on offer here.

01:05:46.325 --> 01:05:53.040
Mr Duke, I don't wish to
underestimate your life's work,

01:05:53.165 --> 01:05:57.920
but the punitive system
does not work.

01:05:58.045 --> 01:06:02.508
My experience convinces me that
more criminal acts are imposed

01:06:02.633 --> 01:06:05.761
on prisoners
than by criminals on society.

01:06:05.886 --> 01:06:08.556
Convinces you, eh?

01:06:08.639 --> 01:06:13.310
Fancy half of that mob charging
up and down your street?

01:06:13.435 --> 01:06:18.023
Fancy your mother tackling
that lot on the rampage?

01:06:18.148 --> 01:06:20.067
No, you bloody well don't.

01:06:20.192 --> 01:06:23.112
So what do you do about it?

01:06:23.237 --> 01:06:25.614
Talk about it, like we are.

01:06:25.739 --> 01:06:28.200
Talk's bullshit.
You lock them up.

01:06:28.325 --> 01:06:32.121
I'd also consider
what happens to their guardians.

01:06:32.246 --> 01:06:35.708
-- Watch it, lad.
-- I'm serious, Mr Duke.

01:06:36.834 --> 01:06:38.794
Take yourself.

01:06:38.919 --> 01:06:44.258
For a weekly wage you have
been locking up men and boys

01:06:44.341 --> 01:06:46.927
most of your
working life, right?

01:06:47.052 --> 01:06:50.181
Hanging down your leg
is your key chain,

01:06:50.306 --> 01:06:53.726
and the length of that chain
indicates the time

01:06:53.851 --> 01:06:56.145
you have spent in the service.

01:06:56.270 --> 01:07:00.941
You may not have been fortunate
in terms of promotion,

01:07:01.066 --> 01:07:04.987
but the length
of that chain gives you rank

01:07:05.112 --> 01:07:08.365
over other officers
of similar rank only.

01:07:08.490 --> 01:07:10.492
It's a constant reminder that,

01:07:10.618 --> 01:07:13.913
having spent your life
in the Prison Service,

01:07:14.038 --> 01:07:16.457
you are still a basic officer.

01:07:16.582 --> 01:07:19.460
Now, who gets
the stick for that?

01:07:19.585 --> 01:07:21.212
Us.

01:07:21.337 --> 01:07:24.131
Who pays for that
daily humiliation?

01:07:24.256 --> 01:07:27.551
Stand up, Archer.

01:07:31.138 --> 01:07:35.559
Wipe that fucking grin off
your face before I knock it off.

01:07:35.684 --> 01:07:37.645
Name and number.

01:07:37.770 --> 01:07:40.731
4721, Archer, sir.

01:07:40.856 --> 01:07:44.860
I give you my fucking coffee
and you think

01:07:44.985 --> 01:07:48.030
you can have the piss out of me?

01:07:48.155 --> 01:07:50.699
No, sir. I didn't.

01:07:50.824 --> 01:07:53.744
And it's as well you don't, lad.

01:07:53.869 --> 01:07:57.081
I was concerned with
being stripped of dignity.

01:07:57.206 --> 01:08:00.751
Cons and screws. We aren't
much different in here.

01:08:00.876 --> 01:08:03.796
You're on report for insolence.

01:08:03.921 --> 01:08:06.131
Yes, sir.

01:08:10.427 --> 01:08:12.263
Stand up straight.

01:08:41.457 --> 01:08:43.460
Right. In.

01:08:58.893 --> 01:09:00.978
You seen her, then?

01:09:01.103 --> 01:09:03.522
Jesus, beautiful.

01:09:05.399 --> 01:09:07.859
I managed to touch her,
you know.

01:09:10.112 --> 01:09:13.616
These visits are gonna
drive me fucking crazy.

01:09:14.867 --> 01:09:19.787
Come on, you lot! Look at
this floor! Get it cleaned!

01:09:20.915 --> 01:09:22.917
Move yourselves!

01:09:25.877 --> 01:09:27.880
Come on, move!

01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:34.720
That includes you, Toyne.

01:09:59.411 --> 01:10:01.705
Mr Sands! Sands! Sands!

01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:04.083
Move your fucking self!

01:10:04.917 --> 01:10:06.794
Mr Jones!

01:10:13.717 --> 01:10:15.719
You black bastard!

01:10:59.805 --> 01:11:01.348
Archer!

01:11:01.473 --> 01:11:02.600
Sir?

01:11:02.725 --> 01:11:04.852
Report to my office!

01:11:08.439 --> 01:11:10.441
Yes, sir!

01:11:16.113 --> 01:11:18.490
Though the reports
are minor individually,

01:11:18.616 --> 01:11:22.995
they do mean that altogether
you are not pulling your weight.

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:25.039
Three days. Lose one month.

01:11:25.164 --> 01:11:28.584
About turn. Out.

01:11:28.709 --> 01:11:30.503
Archer. In.

01:11:32.922 --> 01:11:35.633
Feet on the mat,
legs apart, face the Governor.

01:11:38.052 --> 01:11:41.972
-- Name and number.
-- 4721, Archer, sir.

01:11:42.097 --> 01:11:44.433
Ahh, Archer.

01:11:45.976 --> 01:11:50.397
Insolence, graffiti. Guilty?

01:11:50.523 --> 01:11:52.399
Misplaced trust, sir.

01:11:52.525 --> 01:11:54.944
How's Mecca these days, Archer?

01:11:55.069 --> 01:11:57.655
No further information
as yet, sir.

01:11:57.780 --> 01:12:00.157
Although I am meditating,
whenever possible.

01:12:00.282 --> 01:12:05.788
I see. Have you read

01:12:05.913 --> 01:12:09.416
I don't believe I've had
that literary pleasure, sir.

01:12:09.542 --> 01:12:12.002
You should, you should.

01:12:12.127 --> 01:12:15.256
Seven days in the block.
Lose one month.

01:12:15.381 --> 01:12:19.176
For your meditation, Archer.

01:12:19.301 --> 01:12:22.304
About turn. Out.

01:12:22.429 --> 01:12:24.473
Move it, Archer. Move!

01:12:25.391 --> 01:12:28.477
Come on, Archer!
Move it! Move, Archer!

01:12:28.602 --> 01:12:30.938
Come on, Archer! Double, double!

01:12:32.064 --> 01:12:34.066
I said double!

01:12:38.821 --> 01:12:41.490
You thought the fish was bad?

01:12:41.574 --> 01:12:42.825
Yes, sir.

01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:46.245
-- What about the others?
-- Yes, sir.

01:12:46.370 --> 01:12:49.748
I can answer this. I do
remember the day in question.

01:12:49.874 --> 01:12:52.877
First of all,
that fish was not bad.

01:12:53.002 --> 01:12:56.172
I do admit it may
have seemed strong.

01:12:56.297 --> 01:12:58.007
Strong, yes, but not bad.

01:12:58.132 --> 01:13:00.926
What do you mean,
"strong", Mr White?

01:13:01.051 --> 01:13:04.096
This new Atlantic fish
they're bringing out, sir.

01:13:04.221 --> 01:13:06.891
Its strange taste
can seem strong.

01:13:06.974 --> 01:13:09.018
Ah, well, you know...

01:13:11.145 --> 01:13:14.899
You should complain
at the time if something is off.

01:13:15.024 --> 01:13:16.984
I did, sir.

01:13:17.109 --> 01:13:19.612
-- And?
-- Mr White ate it.

01:13:19.737 --> 01:13:23.741
Wasn't bad, then, was it?
D'you think I'd poison meself?

01:13:23.866 --> 01:13:26.785
That was my dinner.

01:13:26.911 --> 01:13:30.831
Well, we'll keep an eye out
for Atlantic fish.

01:13:30.956 --> 01:13:32.875
Anything else?

01:13:35.085 --> 01:13:38.714
The batter's all soft, sir.

01:13:38.839 --> 01:13:42.885
It always is.
The whole wing moans about it.

01:13:43.010 --> 01:13:44.970
Mr White?

01:13:45.095 --> 01:13:48.849
Of course. It's impossible
to make crispy batter.

01:13:48.974 --> 01:13:54.438
In all my years I've never been
able to make crispy batter.

01:13:54.563 --> 01:14:00.027
The only way is to buy powdered
stuff and we can't afford that.

01:14:00.152 --> 01:14:02.154
Come in!

01:14:03.113 --> 01:14:05.074
Tea, sir?

01:14:05.199 --> 01:14:08.202
-- Tea, Mr Goodyear?
-- Why not, why not?

01:14:10.538 --> 01:14:12.414
Can we smoke, sir?

01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:15.584
One quick burn.
Permission of Mr Goodyear.

01:14:26.846 --> 01:14:29.515
-- What's that?
-- Nothing, sir.

01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:31.851
-- Out.
-- Yes, sir.

01:14:38.232 --> 01:14:42.236
I think that's covered
both wings, Mr White.

01:14:42.361 --> 01:14:44.321
Unless there's anything else,

01:14:44.446 --> 01:14:49.034
and Meakin is satisfied
with the batter explanation?

01:14:54.206 --> 01:14:56.208
Meakin?

01:14:57.918 --> 01:14:59.920
Meakin!

01:15:00.045 --> 01:15:03.090
Answer Mr Goodyear, lad.

01:15:04.592 --> 01:15:06.177
Stand up.

01:15:09.847 --> 01:15:11.599
Toyne's dead!

01:15:11.724 --> 01:15:14.977
He's killed himself
in the Scrubs. He's dead!

01:15:15.102 --> 01:15:19.690
He cut his wrists
and you send him to the Scrubs,

01:15:19.815 --> 01:15:22.234
to kill hisself! He's dead!

01:15:25.529 --> 01:15:28.449
Up your fucking borstal!

01:15:40.419 --> 01:15:44.465
I realise
there's bad feeling about Toyne.

01:15:44.590 --> 01:15:49.345
We're deeply sorry, but these
things happen, as you know.

01:15:49.470 --> 01:15:51.847
Many boys arrive
in disturbed conditions

01:15:51.972 --> 01:15:55.643
and there isn't the staff
to cope with them.

01:15:55.768 --> 01:15:59.855
I don't want the boys on
this wing behaving erratically.

01:15:59.980 --> 01:16:01.941
It'll do no good.

01:16:02.066 --> 01:16:06.529
In fact, they only make things
difficult for themselves.

01:16:06.654 --> 01:16:11.408
I want you to use your influence
to keep things...down.

01:16:11.534 --> 01:16:15.579
If you see what I mean.
It'll soon blow over.

01:16:15.704 --> 01:16:18.999
-- All right, Carlin?
-- Yes, sir.

01:16:19.124 --> 01:16:21.585
Good. Now, off you go.

01:16:32.346 --> 01:16:34.765
-- In.
-- Out!

01:16:37.518 --> 01:16:40.062
3318, Meakin, sir.

01:16:41.188 --> 01:16:43.732
-- In.
-- Out!

01:16:44.859 --> 01:16:47.027
3610, Woods, sir.

01:16:49.530 --> 01:16:51.991
-- In.
-- Out!

01:16:53.117 --> 01:16:55.786
4721, Archer, sir.

01:16:58.163 --> 01:17:00.124
-- In.
-- Sir?

01:17:00.249 --> 01:17:03.627
-- 4736, Angel, sir.
-- What is it, Archer?

01:17:03.752 --> 01:17:07.840
No exercise today, sir. Request
to see the Governor, sir.

01:17:09.592 --> 01:17:11.177
In.

01:17:22.188 --> 01:17:27.193
Archer, exercise
is dependent on the weather.

01:17:27.318 --> 01:17:31.614
-- It looked like rain.
-- But it didn't, sir.

01:17:34.408 --> 01:17:36.911
Dirty cell, Archer.
Governor's report.

01:17:41.874 --> 01:17:44.877
Imagine that
in the back of a Mercedes.

01:17:45.002 --> 01:17:48.714
Looks like a bird I knocked off.
Great bristols.

01:17:48.839 --> 01:17:50.841
Do anything, she would.
Anything.

01:17:50.966 --> 01:17:55.888
I've had that, but thin.
Thin birds go potty for me.

01:17:56.013 --> 01:18:00.184
Christ, when I get out --
the big time, big stuff!

01:18:00.309 --> 01:18:05.105
I've got ideas. You never come
out of nick short on ideas.

01:18:05.231 --> 01:18:07.816
And you know
where you went wrong.

01:18:07.942 --> 01:18:11.195
You can learn a lot in here.

01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:15.616
Banks are best, one big job
and you're set for life.

01:18:15.741 --> 01:18:18.536
Planning, that's all it needs,
and bottle.

01:18:18.661 --> 01:18:22.081
-- In, bang, out.
-- No shortage of birds then.

01:18:22.206 --> 01:18:25.960
I never have been short,
plenty of crumpet after me.

01:18:26.085 --> 01:18:29.129
-- Listen to Burt Reynolds.
-- Watch your mouth.

01:18:29.255 --> 01:18:32.007
Only crumpet you've had
is your fist.

01:18:32.132 --> 01:18:34.301
You'll get my fist.

01:18:34.426 --> 01:18:37.680
Leave off, we're sick
of hearing you two.

01:18:37.805 --> 01:18:40.766
Hey, hey, hark
at our bent friend.

01:18:40.891 --> 01:18:42.852
You two fancy yourselves?

01:18:42.977 --> 01:18:47.356
Piss off. You couldn't organise
a piss--up in a brewery.

01:18:47.481 --> 01:18:50.317
-- I'll have you.
-- Cut it out.

01:18:50.442 --> 01:18:53.612
You got some front, ain't ya?

01:18:53.737 --> 01:18:56.949
We saw you when Carlin
sorted you out.

01:18:57.074 --> 01:19:01.412
You and Pongo. Any more
bother and you'll get it again.

01:19:01.537 --> 01:19:04.999
And Eckersley,
and you know that, shithead.

01:19:05.124 --> 01:19:07.585
Anyone comes near me
gets striped.

01:19:07.710 --> 01:19:09.753
No matter who they are.

01:19:09.879 --> 01:19:14.884
Just remember, shitbag,
people get moved around.

01:19:15.009 --> 01:19:18.762
Carlin ain't gonna be here
changin' your nappies forever.

01:19:18.888 --> 01:19:21.432
He'll be out in a month,

01:19:21.557 --> 01:19:26.812
and I'm gonna carve you two
bastards up first chance I get.

01:19:26.937 --> 01:19:30.024
Just remember that,
the pair of you.

01:19:46.332 --> 01:19:49.001
Can we have a quick burn, sir?

01:19:49.126 --> 01:19:53.297
OK, but don't take
too long about it.

01:20:42.513 --> 01:20:44.473
What d'you want?

01:20:44.598 --> 01:20:46.392
Ah! Ow!

01:20:46.517 --> 01:20:48.519
Turn him over.

01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:57.069
Please! No! No! No--o!

01:20:57.194 --> 01:20:59.363
Please, no!

01:20:59.488 --> 01:21:01.866
-- Ahh.
-- No--o--o!

01:22:08.766 --> 01:22:12.311
Come on,
you lot! Let's have you!

01:22:19.235 --> 01:22:21.195
Right, let's have you!

01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:23.489
Come on outside,
you lazy bastards!

01:22:41.799 --> 01:22:44.093
Davis, what are you doing there?

01:22:44.218 --> 01:22:48.222
-- Well, lad?
-- Nothing, sir. I fell, sir.

01:22:48.347 --> 01:22:52.685
Back on to your feet.
This isn't Kew Gardens, laddie.

01:22:56.772 --> 01:22:58.774
On your feet.

01:23:34.351 --> 01:23:36.812
I was in the laundry today.

01:23:36.937 --> 01:23:38.898
All bleedin' day.

01:23:39.023 --> 01:23:40.482
Murder.

01:23:40.608 --> 01:23:42.568
I hate it in there.

01:23:42.693 --> 01:23:45.613
Not bad tomorrow, though.
On the gardening detail.

01:23:45.738 --> 01:23:47.865
I like that.

01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:50.284
Get some air, like a holiday.

01:23:50.409 --> 01:23:53.120
Almost imagine
you're not in this hole.

01:23:56.081 --> 01:23:59.710
You're on gardening tomorrow.
Your name's on the list.

01:23:59.835 --> 01:24:01.754
See you, then.

01:25:50.696 --> 01:25:53.073
All right, Davis, what is it?

01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:56.160
Speak up.

01:25:56.285 --> 01:26:00.331
Why d'you ring?
Don't you know it's an offence?

01:26:00.456 --> 01:26:05.711
I feel lonely, sir. Frightened,
sir. I daren't close me eyes.

01:26:05.836 --> 01:26:09.965
I feel bad, depressed.
I don't know what to do.

01:26:10.090 --> 01:26:12.051
Cut that out, Davis,

01:26:12.176 --> 01:26:16.639
or I'll give you something
to cry about, you little toerag.

01:26:16.764 --> 01:26:22.102
You touch that bell again
I'll have you down the block.

01:26:22.228 --> 01:26:25.022
Now, get your
subnormal head down.

01:26:27.191 --> 01:26:28.984
Move!

01:28:00.743 --> 01:28:02.536
Ah!

01:28:26.185 --> 01:28:27.937
Ah!

01:29:22.449 --> 01:29:24.743
Wakey wakey!

01:29:24.869 --> 01:29:28.706
-- 6.30, come on, get up!
-- Rise and shine!

01:29:29.832 --> 01:29:32.877
-- Wakey wakey, come on!
-- Rise and shine!

01:29:38.632 --> 01:29:40.759
Come on, up you get!

01:29:53.522 --> 01:29:57.026
Come on, move!
Right, up to attention!

01:29:58.736 --> 01:30:01.530
Davis, you lazy twat! Out!

01:30:04.950 --> 01:30:07.494
Right, Davis, Governor's report.

01:30:13.834 --> 01:30:15.544
Right, Mr Duke!

01:30:15.669 --> 01:30:18.964
Put 'em in their rooms!
Move yourselves!

01:30:19.089 --> 01:30:21.008
That includes you, Archer!

01:30:21.133 --> 01:30:23.511
-- Come on.
-- Move yourselves! Move!

01:30:23.636 --> 01:30:25.638
And you, Carlin!

01:30:28.015 --> 01:30:29.683
Move!

01:30:51.038 --> 01:30:53.040
Eat!

01:30:59.922 --> 01:31:02.508
Eat, or it goes in the bins!

01:31:06.804 --> 01:31:08.806
Eat!

01:31:49.180 --> 01:31:51.182
Carlin! Eat!

01:31:54.935 --> 01:31:58.814
Dead, Dead, Dead...!

01:32:07.239 --> 01:32:10.075
Dead! Dead! Dead!

01:32:14.872 --> 01:32:16.999
Eat, Carlin!

01:32:49.990 --> 01:32:51.325
Cunts!

01:32:51.450 --> 01:32:54.161
Fucking bastards!

01:33:00.751 --> 01:33:01.961
Dead!

01:33:02.086 --> 01:33:04.755
Dead! Dead! Dead!

01:33:30.614 --> 01:33:32.575
Come on, Archer!

01:34:12.573 --> 01:34:16.660
First, the damage
must be paid for.

01:34:16.785 --> 01:34:22.124
Loss of earnings until every
damaged article is paid for.

01:34:22.249 --> 01:34:27.296
And to encourage you to work
hard and make good this debt

01:34:27.421 --> 01:34:30.466
with all expediency,
there are no privileges.

01:34:30.591 --> 01:34:34.261
None. You have to earn them.

01:34:34.386 --> 01:34:41.477
Now, with regard to our absent
friend, I would remind you all

01:34:41.602 --> 01:34:46.482
that sad and unfortunate
accidents occur

01:34:46.607 --> 01:34:51.570
in institutions like this
just as they do outside.

01:34:51.695 --> 01:34:56.367
We are all accident--prone,
even here.

01:34:56.492 --> 01:34:58.827
It is most regrettable,

01:34:58.953 --> 01:35:02.456
but I will tolerate
no further outbursts

01:35:02.581 --> 01:35:05.167
like the one recently witnessed.

01:35:05.292 --> 01:35:07.795
I will not tolerate it.

01:35:11.507 --> 01:35:16.178
There will now be
one minute's silent prayer

01:35:16.303 --> 01:35:18.514
for our departed friend.
