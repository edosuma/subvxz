the county courthouse, but it was closed.

06:24.968 --> 06:26.635

the first floor said to me

06:26.719 --> 06:28.137
that I should take it down
to the hall of records,

but then nobody knew what I was talkin' about.

remembered what you said about the telephone.

So I called the man up,
I got him on the line,

06:37.730 --> 06:39.898
and that didn't
do no good neither

06:39.983 --> 06:41.942
because he said that
the man at the first place

should've already
sent it to my address.
