- [Derek] Well we can
come and see you anytime.

16:58.914 --> 17:01.227
- No, I'll be there.

17:01.261 --> 17:02.055
Bye.

17:03.091 --> 17:05.023
- [Doctor] Now, you see
where the lesions are.

17:05.058 --> 17:08.268
It's actually quite
difficult to operate there,

17:08.303 --> 17:12.271
but we don't think the cancer
has spread.

17:12.307 --> 17:13.272
That's very fortunate.

17:13.308 --> 17:14.204
That's great news.

17:14.240 --> 17:15.550
- So it's official?

17:15.586 --> 17:16.621
- What do you mean?

17:16.656 --> 17:18.692
- I do have liver cancer?

17:18.727 --> 17:21.626
- Well, that's what we
think it is.

17:22.765 --> 17:25.215
That's not the end of the road,
you know.

17:25.251 --> 17:28.944
As you know cancer's
not what it used to be.

17:28.978 --> 17:32.223
So what we're recommending
is we introduce chemo

17:32.258 --> 17:35.399
directly into the lesions
in the liver.

17:35.433 --> 17:39.265
It's a very simple operation
but it'll buy us time.

17:39.299 --> 17:40.128
- Chemo operation?

17:40.162 --> 17:41.232
- It's not even an operation.

17:41.267 --> 17:43.096
It's a very basic procedure.

17:43.131 --> 17:46.203
We go up through the groin, up
the main artery to the liver.

17:46.237 --> 17:49.965
Now, if that all goes well
and your lungs are clear,

17:49.999 --> 17:51.760
we've got a very good chance

17:51.794 --> 17:53.141
of getting on a transplant list.

17:55.039 --> 17:58.939
- So, my liver didn't have
small scars.

17:58.974 --> 18:01.010
These are big cancerous lesions.

18:02.253 --> 18:03.289
Difficult to operate.

18:04.290 --> 18:06.292
The liver transplant list?

18:06.326 --> 18:07.396
Buy me time?

18:07.431 --> 18:09.122
What time?

18:09.157 --> 18:09.985
Whose time?

18:10.813 --> 18:12.091
Aw, this isn't happening.

18:17.372 --> 18:20.168
Have you really turned gay or
are you

18:20.202 --> 18:21.272
just trying to cheer me up?

18:22.342 --> 18:23.792
- Maybe I was joking.

18:25.621 --> 18:28.590
I don't know, are you
still seeing that woman?

18:28.624 --> 18:30.316
- Huh? What woman?

18:30.350 --> 18:32.145
[hammer tapping]

18:32.180 --> 18:35.321
- That's what you called
her, "That woman."

18:36.218 --> 18:37.461
[Robert and Poppy chuckle]

18:37.495 --> 18:39.290
- No, no, no, she wasn't my
type.

18:41.982 --> 18:45.124
Look, your mother wanted to
come over but I told her not to.

18:45.158 --> 18:47.195
I wanted to talk to you first.

18:48.644 --> 18:49.404
I, um...

18:51.337 --> 18:53.822
I saw a different doctor today,
a surgeon,

18:53.856 --> 18:57.895
and he's confirmed I've
got cancer of liver

18:57.929 --> 19:01.209
and I'll have to have chemo
treatment.

19:01.243 --> 19:02.934
The liver's in bad shape.

19:04.246 --> 19:07.318
But if I get on the transplant
list--

19:07.353 --> 19:08.181
- A transplant?

19:08.216 --> 19:09.389
- [Robert] Yeah.

19:09.424 --> 19:10.563
- What sort of transplant?

19:12.737 --> 19:14.153
- Well, a liver transplant.

19:15.015 --> 19:15.775
- [Poppy] No.

19:16.569 --> 19:17.363
- Yeah.

19:24.232 --> 19:25.302
- [Poppy] I don't believe this.

19:25.336 --> 19:28.097
- No, neither do I.

19:28.132 --> 19:29.409
- [Poppy] What did James say?

19:30.583 --> 19:32.274
- Well, I haven't told him yet.

19:36.589 --> 19:39.937
[somber ambient music]

19:46.909 --> 19:49.567
[mouse clicking]

19:53.882 --> 19:56.436

[speaking in foreign language]

20:25.672 --> 20:26.915
[mouse clicks]

20:26.949 --> 20:30.436
- Welcome to Dr. Kumar's
Center of Excellence.

of services

20:33.335 --> 20:35.820
in regards to organ
transplantations.

20:36.683 --> 20:41.688
Heart, kidney, lungs, liver,
and all tissue transplants.

20:43.138 --> 20:47.763
You name it and we can do
it, and we do it so well.

20:50.214 --> 20:53.424
Our clinic is like a luxury
hotel.

20:54.460 --> 20:56.082
Five golden stars.

[metal clicking]

21:34.154 --> 21:35.224
[Robert grunts]

21:35.259 --> 21:36.881
- You left the door wide open.

21:36.916 --> 21:37.710
- Hi.

21:38.918 --> 21:40.126
- Hello.

21:40.160 --> 21:42.887
- Oh, how are you?

21:42.922 --> 21:45.165
- Do you mind if I have a look
around?

21:45.200 --> 21:46.305
I'll be very quiet.

21:46.339 --> 21:47.340
- Yeah, cut through here.
[clock chiming]

21:47.375 --> 21:48.721
I've got some pieces in here.

21:48.755 --> 21:50.861
- Oh wow.

21:50.895 --> 21:51.862
Thanks.

21:51.896 --> 21:53.173
- When will it be ready?

21:54.589 --> 21:55.590
- Well, it is ready.

21:59.179 --> 22:01.320
- I'm sorry to hear the news.

22:01.354 --> 22:02.321
- What news?

22:04.046 --> 22:04.875
Eh, who told you?

22:04.909 --> 22:07.015
- Is there anything I can do?

22:08.292 --> 22:10.398
I'm here, Robert, you know that.

22:10.432 --> 22:11.191
[phone ringing]

22:11.226 --> 22:12.676
Oh, sorry.

22:16.507 --> 22:17.922
Hello? What's the problem?

22:19.303 --> 22:22.410
[animals chattering]

22:33.421 --> 22:35.423
- Ah, I always wanted to be an
artist,

22:35.457 --> 22:37.735
but no, that wasn't possible.

22:37.770 --> 22:39.772
No, I'm a biologist still.

22:40.600 --> 22:41.877
Marine biologist.

22:41.912 --> 22:44.708
I work at the aquarium
'til the end of the year

22:44.742 --> 22:47.607
and then I head home.

22:48.574 --> 22:49.954
- And where is home?

22:51.093 --> 22:53.544
- Well, my family is
from the north of India,

22:53.579 --> 22:58.135
but we live in
Thiruvananthapuram.

22:59.619 --> 23:01.587
- You mean Trivandrum?

23:01.621 --> 23:03.520
- No, Thiruvananthapuram.

23:03.554 --> 23:05.418
- Oh come on, no one outside
India can pronounce that.

23:05.453 --> 23:07.040
- [scoffs] You just need to
practice it.

23:07.075 --> 23:09.457
I mean, people back home
also have trouble saying it.

23:09.491 --> 23:11.493
It's Thiruvananthapuram.

23:12.563 --> 23:13.633
[Robert grunts]

23:13.668 --> 23:14.738
[Maya laughs]
- I'll work on it.

23:14.772 --> 23:15.532
[door clangs]

23:15.566 --> 23:16.602
- Ooh-ooh!

23:16.636 --> 23:17.775
Terribly sorry, I have to get
back.

23:17.810 --> 23:20.122
Nobody ever listens.

23:20.157 --> 23:21.572
We'll talk later.

23:21.607 --> 23:22.815
Please look after Maya?

23:22.849 --> 23:24.264
You'll have to take her
to the station.

23:24.299 --> 23:25.576
Is that all right, do you mind?

23:25.611 --> 23:29.062
I must fly. [smacks a kiss]

23:29.097 --> 23:29.856
I'll ring you.

23:31.582 --> 23:34.413
[phone ringing]

23:35.483 --> 23:36.967
Hello? Oh.

23:37.001 --> 23:39.418
I tried to--
[door clangs]

23:39.452 --> 23:40.211
- Hm.

23:41.799 --> 23:44.630
Well, Miriam says she's
one of your best friends.

23:45.596 --> 23:47.356
- [chuckles] Well,
that's the rumor.

23:48.668 --> 23:53.432
No, Miriam sells my work but
she knows very little about it.

23:53.466 --> 23:54.674
[train whistle blows]

23:54.709 --> 23:57.505
She's got a good heart, but I
don't think

23:57.539 --> 23:58.747
she really understands--

23:58.782 --> 24:02.820
- Do you understand your work?
[chuckles]

24:02.855 --> 24:04.753
- No, no I don't really.

24:04.788 --> 24:05.996
- That's good.

24:06.030 --> 24:08.205
It's always good not to
understand what you do.

24:09.517 --> 24:11.657
- [Robert] And did Miriam
also tell you I have cancer?

24:11.691 --> 24:14.522
[train rumbling]

24:14.556 --> 24:16.489
- No, no she didn't.

24:19.354 --> 24:20.700
I'm sorry to hear that.

24:22.530 --> 24:25.533
My uncle also has cancer.

24:25.567 --> 24:27.396
- [Robert] What sort does he
have?

24:27.431 --> 24:28.294
- Stomach.

24:28.328 --> 24:30.503
He's had a few operations.

24:30.538 --> 24:31.366
He's fine.

24:32.160 --> 24:33.230
He's old.

24:34.024 --> 24:34.783
He's an old man.

24:34.818 --> 24:35.681
- Oh, so am I.

24:36.544 --> 24:37.821
[Maya scoffs]

24:37.855 --> 24:40.168
- That's what you say
but not what you think.

24:43.516 --> 24:45.345
Can I touch?

24:45.380 --> 24:46.381
- [Robert] Yeah go ahead.

24:46.415 --> 24:47.555
All my work's meant
to be touched.

24:53.595 --> 24:57.047
[train whistle blowing]

25:13.615 --> 25:15.410
You can open it if you like.

25:18.793 --> 25:21.485
[water sloshing]

25:25.144 --> 25:26.732
- [Maya] I like your work
very much.

25:26.766 --> 25:28.596
- Thank you.

25:28.630 --> 25:30.908
Look, Miriam's introduced you
twice.

25:30.943 --> 25:33.014
I'm sorry, I still didn't get
your name.

25:33.048 --> 25:34.533
- Oh, I have two names.

25:34.567 --> 25:36.914
You can call me Maya or Martha.

25:36.949 --> 25:38.882
- And what's the difference?

25:38.916 --> 25:41.747
- Well, Martha means the seeing
eye

25:41.781 --> 25:45.129
and Maya means illusion.

25:45.164 --> 25:48.098
But illusion is more
realistic, don't you think?

25:48.132 --> 25:50.410
- [chuckles] Yes, realistic,
yes it is.

25:54.518 --> 25:55.450
Thiruvananthapuram.

25:56.900 --> 25:58.246
[Maya laughs]

25:58.280 --> 25:59.937
- Yeah, that's much better.

26:02.250 --> 26:03.147
- Good boy.

26:04.459 --> 26:06.737
That's a good one, come on.

26:06.772 --> 26:08.808
[truck rumbling]

26:08.843 --> 26:11.500
[dog barking]

26:18.749 --> 26:19.543
- Robert.

26:20.648 --> 26:21.649
So glad you came.

26:21.683 --> 26:22.891
- How are ya, Dad?

26:22.926 --> 26:23.651
- I'm fine, fine.
- Good.

26:23.685 --> 26:26.032
- Yeah, yeah, living it up.

26:29.380 --> 26:30.830
- Good to see you.
- You, too.

26:31.935 --> 26:32.901
- Right.

26:32.936 --> 26:33.695
Come on.

26:39.701 --> 26:43.636
Louise is teaching me what to
look for.

26:43.671 --> 26:45.845
- I'm feeding him ham, though.

26:45.880 --> 26:47.019
- We stargaze together.

26:49.815 --> 26:52.611
[foghorn bellows]

26:54.682 --> 26:57.926
A friend of mine is a
surgeon at your hospital.

26:57.961 --> 26:59.652
I'm having lunch with him
tomorrow.

27:01.689 --> 27:04.657
- Oh, I'm starting
chemotherapy next week, Dad.

27:05.727 --> 27:07.280
If I'm going to stop the rot for
a while

27:07.315 --> 27:08.557
should give me a chance.

27:10.836 --> 27:14.633
- Is there anything at all I can
do?

27:16.358 --> 27:18.637
Look, you will get on the
transplant list.

27:18.671 --> 27:19.776
I'm sure of that.

27:19.810 --> 27:21.191
- Even if I get on the list,

27:21.225 --> 27:23.676
unfortunately there's just
not enough donors around.

27:23.711 --> 27:26.472
- Hannah says you're gonna
need someone to look after you.

27:26.506 --> 27:27.231
[Robert chuckles]

27:27.266 --> 27:28.819
Now she said she would.

27:28.854 --> 27:30.856
Look, Robert, I know it's none
of my business but she cares.

27:30.890 --> 27:32.064
She's family.

27:32.098 --> 27:33.686
- Yeah, well I can look after
myself, Dad.

27:33.721 --> 27:35.481
- Family is important now.

27:35.515 --> 27:36.827
- Yeah.

27:36.862 --> 27:38.449
I'm not an invalid, yet.

27:41.625 --> 27:43.247
[ominous ambient music]

27:43.282 --> 27:44.904
Can't say what he feels.

27:45.905 --> 27:47.838
It's always like that.

27:47.873 --> 27:50.392
Reticent, enigmatic, distant.

27:51.635 --> 27:53.257
He never said how he met Louise.

27:53.292 --> 27:54.534
Where did he meet her?

27:56.951 --> 27:58.780
Never tells the full story.

28:03.923 --> 28:06.063
Never told me my mother was
dying.

28:06.098 --> 28:08.825
She just died, my mother.

28:08.859 --> 28:09.791
My own mother.

28:11.897 --> 28:13.795
I've always missed her.

28:14.658 --> 28:15.763
Nobody knows anything.

28:17.765 --> 28:18.766
Aw, nothing matters now.

28:20.906 --> 28:23.253
I've got cancer, cancer
of the liver they say.

28:23.287 --> 28:24.288
I'll die soon.

28:25.393 --> 28:26.739
No, no, no I'm not gonna die.

28:27.878 --> 28:29.673
I must finish my sculpture,
that's important.

28:32.572 --> 28:34.229
Maya, she follows me.

28:36.438 --> 28:39.718
She's always in my mind, who is
she?

28:39.752 --> 28:40.511
Oh!

28:55.803 --> 28:56.907
What is this?

29:00.773 --> 29:01.843
No, no, I gotta think.

29:03.362 --> 29:05.329
The, uh, where?

29:07.849 --> 29:09.920
It was, um, I can't.

29:09.955 --> 29:11.335
- Are you all right.
- I can't.

29:11.370 --> 29:12.958
I'm fine, thank you.

29:15.512 --> 29:18.101
[Robert groans]

29:22.208 --> 29:23.140
I can't.

29:25.211 --> 29:26.972
I can't then.

29:27.006 --> 29:28.456
Oh yes.

29:29.698 --> 29:31.010
Oh.

29:31.045 --> 29:32.632
- [Nurse] I'll get you
something to help you sleep.

29:32.667 --> 29:35.290
- No, I'm fine, thank you.

29:35.325 --> 29:36.809
Oh.

29:36.844 --> 29:38.949
[water rumbling]

30:31.622 --> 30:35.834
[patients and doctors
chattering]

30:42.357 --> 30:44.877
- [James] I came yesterday
but you were asleep.

30:44.912 --> 30:47.155
- [chuckles] I wasn't asleep.

30:47.190 --> 30:48.329
I was hallucinating.

30:48.363 --> 30:50.020
How did you know where I was?

30:50.055 --> 30:52.091
- Oh, I checked with the
authorities.

30:52.126 --> 30:53.437
They tell me you're doing fine.

30:53.472 --> 30:55.267
- Oh, don't believe the
authorities.

30:56.199 --> 30:58.028
- [James] I'll let you go
tomorrow, then.

30:58.063 --> 31:00.582
Then I'll repeat the procedure
in a couple of weeks.

31:04.103 --> 31:06.934
[thunder rumbles]

31:09.971 --> 31:11.524
I went to the gallery.

31:11.559 --> 31:14.113
Miriam tells me that
charmed this young lady.

31:14.148 --> 31:16.046
- Oh nonsense.

31:16.081 --> 31:17.772
- She's very beautiful I hear.

31:17.806 --> 31:19.118
- Oh please, James.

31:19.153 --> 31:20.879
- All right?
- Please.

31:21.776 --> 31:22.535
Oh.

31:22.570 --> 31:24.227
- Oldie but a goodie.

31:25.228 --> 31:28.956
[singing in foreign language]

31:36.964 --> 31:38.068
- [Robert] Oh!

31:38.103 --> 31:39.828
- I'm off.
- Oh.

31:39.863 --> 31:42.107
- [mumbles] all right?

31:42.141 --> 31:43.142
- [Poppy] How are ya, Dad?

31:43.177 --> 31:44.661
- I'm fine, my darling.

31:44.695 --> 31:47.560
[thunder rumbles]

31:47.595 --> 31:49.735
- They tell me it's okay
and you go home tomorrow.

31:49.769 --> 31:50.494
- Mm.
- So I'll come

31:50.529 --> 31:51.288
and pick you up.

31:51.323 --> 31:52.289
- Okay.
- Mom's just in the car.

31:52.324 --> 31:53.083
- Why?

31:53.118 --> 31:54.671
- We couldn't find a park.

31:54.705 --> 31:57.087
- There's plenty of spots in the
carpark.

31:57.122 --> 31:59.055
Well she didn't wanna walk.

31:59.089 --> 32:00.642
- You're being childish.

32:00.677 --> 32:03.438
- No, no, I'm sorry, my darling.

32:03.473 --> 32:05.130
[Robert exhales]

32:05.164 --> 32:07.270
- What were you dreaming about
last night?

32:08.167 --> 32:10.100
- Why would you wanna know?

32:10.135 --> 32:12.171
- [scoffs] Well you
woke up the entire floor

32:12.206 --> 32:15.623
with a lot of foul language
and you scared a young nurse.

32:15.657 --> 32:16.417
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Oh.

32:16.451 --> 32:17.970
- Could you tell her I'm sorry?

32:18.005 --> 32:20.007
- [scoffs] You can tell her
yourself.

32:20.041 --> 32:21.767
[Poppy and Robert chuckle]

32:21.801 --> 32:24.080
- [Poppy] That is the right
type of woman for you, Dad.

32:24.114 --> 32:25.667
- Yeah, she's perfect.

32:25.702 --> 32:26.979
[Poppy laughs]

32:27.014 --> 32:28.015
You're a darling, thank you.
- There you go.

32:28.049 --> 32:29.292
You all right?
- Yeah.

32:29.326 --> 32:30.465
- [Poppy] I have to go,

32:30.500 --> 32:31.846
but I'll come and pick you up
tomorrow.

32:31.880 --> 32:34.987
Would you please listen to the
nurses and behave? [chuckles]

32:35.022 --> 32:36.678
- [Robert] Yeah, I will, my
darling.

32:36.713 --> 32:37.507
See ya, Pops.

32:37.541 --> 32:38.301
- [Poppy] Bye.

32:38.335 --> 32:41.649
[smacks a kiss]

32:41.683 --> 32:46.688
[somber piano music]
[rain pattering]

33:04.085 --> 33:07.054
[children chattering]

33:11.196 --> 33:14.095
[finger squeaking]

33:22.172 --> 33:25.555
[quirky electronic music]

33:26.728 --> 33:28.006
- [Nurse] Just a sharp needle.

33:32.044 --> 33:33.425
- [Robert] The world inside me.

33:35.461 --> 33:36.635
Arteries become rivers.

33:38.292 --> 33:40.915
The sea, sky, earth,

33:42.917 --> 33:44.091
one form, one shape.

33:47.094 --> 33:47.887
My blood.

33:49.096 --> 33:50.614
My own blood.

33:50.649 --> 33:51.995
How much blood?

33:53.445 --> 33:56.068
Where did it come from?

33:56.103 --> 33:57.932
Are they keeping my blood
or are they throwing it out

33:57.966 --> 33:59.071
once they're done with me?

34:00.900 --> 34:02.902
Who has my blood?

34:03.834 --> 34:06.596
[thunder rumbles]

34:08.770 --> 34:10.289
- You're wife's here
to pick you up.

34:13.327 --> 34:14.085
- Hello, darling.

34:14.121 --> 34:15.743
- What are you doing here?

34:15.777 --> 34:17.226
I could've got a taxi.

34:17.262 --> 34:19.195
- You know we can't let you go
home alone.

34:19.228 --> 34:21.231
- And he has an appointment,
too.

34:21.266 --> 34:22.646
- Thanks very much.

34:22.681 --> 34:23.784
- Thank you.

34:23.820 --> 34:24.579
Here ya go.

34:24.614 --> 34:25.614
- Thank you.

34:28.514 --> 34:29.446
[group chattering]

34:29.481 --> 34:30.965
Another doctor talks to us.

34:32.139 --> 34:32.898
I don't listen.

34:32.931 --> 34:34.623
[clock ticking]

34:34.658 --> 34:36.833
What am I doing here?

34:36.867 --> 34:37.627
This isn't my life.

34:37.661 --> 34:39.560
What is my life?

34:39.594 --> 34:43.253
- You can sort of guess, okay
it's roughly in the period

34:43.288 --> 34:46.118
of two or three months
or it's likely to last

34:46.152 --> 34:47.326
about a year or two.
- And how long

34:47.360 --> 34:49.293
do you think Robert has to live?

34:49.328 --> 34:51.848
- [Robert] Ah, trust her
to ask a thing like that.

34:51.882 --> 34:53.331
- That's a really hard question.

34:53.367 --> 34:55.507
We don't know exactly,
but I'll say

34:55.541 --> 34:57.302
roughly about six months.

35:02.548 --> 35:04.136
- [crying] Oh.

35:04.171 --> 35:09.141
I thought...
[Robert mumbles]

35:12.386 --> 35:13.352
[Hannah sobbing]

35:13.387 --> 35:14.698
- Hey, it's okay.

35:16.148 --> 35:19.324
[visitors chattering]

35:23.845 --> 35:26.400
[Hannah crying]

35:37.031 --> 35:38.722
- Let me just help you.

35:38.757 --> 35:40.862
- I'm just gonna do some work,
eh?

35:40.897 --> 35:43.175
- Why don't I make you a
cup of tea or something?

35:51.873 --> 35:54.393
[cymbal clangs]

35:56.223 --> 35:58.086
- Hannah doesn't understand that
I need

35:58.121 --> 36:00.365
to be in the studio alone.

36:01.366 --> 36:02.160
Poppy does.

36:07.717 --> 36:10.444
Chemo clouds will allow me
a little breathing time,

36:11.686 --> 36:12.894
or dreaming time.

36:14.793 --> 36:16.933
I'm starting to see things
again.

36:18.106 --> 36:20.454
I'm surrounded by warmth
and love and hope.

36:22.352 --> 36:25.252
This is, or was, my family
but we're all alone now.

36:28.427 --> 36:30.602
I can't sleep with Hannah.

36:30.636 --> 36:33.363
She wants to but
that time is gone.

36:33.398 --> 36:34.399
[rain pattering]

36:34.433 --> 36:35.572
Maya said she'd visit me.

36:36.918 --> 36:37.712
Hm.

36:39.266 --> 36:41.164
I'd pretty much like to sleep
with her.

36:42.441 --> 36:47.032
I feel very homesick 'cause
I don't know where home is.

36:47.066 --> 36:50.311
[somber ambient music]

37:11.677 --> 37:13.403
The more important point
is the fact

37:13.438 --> 37:15.578
that the longer that you
look at this painting,

37:15.612 --> 37:18.719
as in any great painting,
the deeper and richer

37:18.753 --> 37:20.514
[door thuds]
that painting will become.

37:22.309 --> 37:25.450
[projector clicks]

37:27.935 --> 37:30.006
Van Gogh's Sunflowers.

37:30.040 --> 37:31.870
A very different painting,
and yet,

37:33.009 --> 37:34.942
we all think we know this
painting

37:34.976 --> 37:38.117
but if we allow ourselves
to look at this painting

37:38.152 --> 37:42.432
for a long time it will
always become fresh and new.

37:43.502 --> 37:46.609
Vincent himself said, "This
is the kind of painting

37:46.643 --> 37:49.267
"that rather changes to the eye

37:49.301 --> 37:53.305
"and takes on richness the
longer you look at it."

37:53.340 --> 37:55.652
Later he wrote to his brother
and he said,

37:55.687 --> 37:57.827
"If at the end of my career I
shall prove

37:57.861 --> 38:00.623
"to be wrong, so be it.

38:00.657 --> 38:02.487
"Then I shall find that not only
the yards

38:02.521 --> 38:06.111
"but everything else were only
dreams,

38:06.145 --> 38:07.906
"that one has nothing at all
oneself.

38:09.010 --> 38:10.529
"If we're as flimsy as that,

38:10.564 --> 38:12.980
"there is nothing to be said

38:13.014 --> 38:17.743
"against the unlimited
possibilities of future
existence."

38:20.021 --> 38:22.265
We walked for hours, we talked
for hours.

38:23.991 --> 38:24.750
She's wise.

38:26.234 --> 38:27.097
She's warm.

38:28.754 --> 38:29.755
She's human.

38:31.378 --> 38:34.829
And she believes in
fate, that we can twist

38:34.864 --> 38:38.143
the shape of fate but don't
have much say in the matter.

38:38.177 --> 38:40.352
Why did I meet this woman now?

38:42.389 --> 38:45.288
[women chattering]

38:46.254 --> 38:50.569
Life has changed just in a few
weeks.

38:51.501 --> 38:54.366
Oh, another blast of chemo.

38:54.401 --> 38:56.748
It makes me sick, tired.

38:58.370 --> 39:01.097
Hannah wants to look after me.

39:01.131 --> 39:02.305
That's not a good idea.

39:03.927 --> 39:05.204
Six months?

39:06.309 --> 39:08.069
What are they saying?

39:08.104 --> 39:10.693
My life, I'm losing my life.

39:10.727 --> 39:12.902
That's not possible.

39:12.936 --> 39:16.215
[ominous ambient music]

39:16.250 --> 39:17.044
Oh, Maya.

39:18.632 --> 39:19.426
Maya.

39:20.634 --> 39:22.463
An illusion or the seeing eye?

39:28.780 --> 39:31.438
[water sloshing]

39:39.825 --> 39:44.140
[man speaking in foreign
language]

39:49.559 --> 39:50.491
- He's very weak.

39:52.631 --> 39:54.564
Wants to see you.

39:54.599 --> 39:58.637
[man speaking in foreign
language]

40:04.505 --> 40:07.405
- What a beautiful dream it is.

40:07.439 --> 40:09.441
- A good one, Uncle.

40:09.476 --> 40:10.304
It's me.

40:12.686 --> 40:14.515
- So happy to see you.

40:18.001 --> 40:22.005
See the spirit looms above

40:22.040 --> 40:23.938
beyond matter.

40:23.973 --> 40:24.767
- Yes.

40:26.976 --> 40:30.082
- [chuckles] You look like a
bride.

40:30.117 --> 40:33.120
[Maya chuckles]

40:33.154 --> 40:33.948
- Are you good?

40:37.504 --> 40:38.781
- Time is marching on.

40:42.232 --> 40:46.996
[gasps] Have you seen the
orchards we planted together?

40:48.169 --> 40:49.619
- Yes, yes.

40:49.654 --> 40:52.622
[uncle grunting]

40:53.968 --> 40:57.903
- It will be [mumbles] at once.

41:02.080 --> 41:04.082
Weed it back this year.

41:08.845 --> 41:11.676
We are all raising hope

41:11.710 --> 41:13.678
it will do so once more.

41:16.370 --> 41:21.340
Water glass, good [mumbles].
[groans]

41:27.070 --> 41:30.418
[somber ambient music]

41:31.558 --> 41:33.939
My explosion is finished.

41:35.665 --> 41:37.667
- You called it confrontation
before.

41:40.670 --> 41:41.671
- It's both.

41:44.778 --> 41:45.606
One with all.

41:50.093 --> 41:52.579
[bell ringing]

42:00.794 --> 42:03.969
[ominous ambient music]

42:07.939 --> 42:10.942
[knuckles knocking]

42:24.749 --> 42:25.784
- Hello.
- Hello.

42:25.819 --> 42:26.923
- [Robert] Come in.

42:26.958 --> 42:28.684
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you
knocking.

42:28.718 --> 42:30.202
- Oh, I just knocked on every
window.

42:30.237 --> 42:32.619
- [Robert] I'm sorry, I didn't
hear you.

42:32.653 --> 42:34.482
- How are you feeling?

42:34.517 --> 42:36.623
- Well, I feel much better now,
thank you.

42:37.520 --> 42:38.625
- Good.

42:38.659 --> 42:42.594
Well, I got you some special
Indian tea.

42:43.457 --> 42:45.114
Dr. James said that you should
be in bed

42:45.148 --> 42:47.495
and that you're very stubborn.

42:47.530 --> 42:49.843
- [chuckles] Oh, Dr. James is a
pest.

42:51.672 --> 42:53.985
He's more stubborn than any of
us.

42:54.019 --> 42:56.297
Did Miriam give you his number?

42:56.332 --> 42:58.783
- No, I didn't wanna bother you.

42:58.817 --> 43:02.234
- No, James is one of my oldest
friends.

43:02.269 --> 43:04.927
We have known each other
for a few hundred years.

43:07.861 --> 43:08.793
Go through.

43:10.657 --> 43:14.522
[breathing heavily] Please.

43:16.559 --> 43:18.457
- You should drink that tea.

43:18.492 --> 43:19.286
Twice a day.

43:20.114 --> 43:20.839
- Ah?

43:20.874 --> 43:21.668
What does it do?

43:22.807 --> 43:24.843
- It will restore your faith.

43:24.878 --> 43:25.672
[couple chuckle]

43:25.706 --> 43:26.776
- I haven't lost it.

43:29.814 --> 43:33.196
- What is your faith, actually?

43:33.231 --> 43:36.130
- Oh, I'm an informed agnostic,
humanist.

43:39.237 --> 43:40.652
Romantic.
- Oh come on.

43:40.687 --> 43:43.413
That's too easy. [chuckles]

43:49.247 --> 43:52.975
[traditional Indian music]

43:53.009 --> 43:55.011
Okay, you shouldn't exhaust
yourself.

43:56.254 --> 43:57.635
Come on.

43:57.669 --> 43:59.706
You need to get to sleep.

44:01.017 --> 44:02.812
- Yeah, I'll lie down.

44:04.055 --> 44:04.849
Thank you.

44:11.234 --> 44:14.686
- When you feel better
I'll tell you everything.

44:16.274 --> 44:18.552
- Oh, everything?

44:18.586 --> 44:19.587

44:25.904 --> 44:27.734
Why don't you stay here?

44:33.394 --> 44:34.672
- I have my instructions.

44:37.088 --> 44:38.365
I'll sleep on the couch.

44:42.369 --> 44:44.509
- Sleep with me.

44:44.543 --> 44:48.237
[soft orchestral music]

44:48.271 --> 44:49.687
- Get some rest.

44:51.378 --> 44:53.863
You're a patient now, remember?

45:03.804 --> 45:04.909

46:25.817 --> 46:27.474
- [Robert] Good morning.

46:27.508 --> 46:30.649
- I got you some special tea.

46:30.684 --> 46:32.617
Did you see the sky last night?

46:32.651 --> 46:34.101
It was amazing.

46:34.136 --> 46:35.862
- [Robert] I was too busy
sleeping.

46:35.896 --> 46:37.449
- Well, you look well.

46:37.484 --> 46:39.935

feel a little bit better.

46:39.969 --> 46:43.766

47:03.924 --> 47:06.582
You're a very beautiful woman.

47:09.896 --> 47:11.898

47:15.798 --> 47:19.595
[singing in foreign language]

47:54.319 --> 47:56.908
I don't like being away
from them for so long.

47:56.943 --> 47:57.978
You know they're old.

47:58.841 --> 47:59.635
- Hm, how old?

48:06.780 --> 48:08.126
- [Maya] [mumbles] absurd to ask
you

48:08.161 --> 48:10.646
all those questions, don't you
think?

48:10.680 --> 48:14.063
- [Robert] She was upset,
didn't have to ask her.

48:14.098 --> 48:16.100
Are you gonna tell me?

48:16.134 --> 48:18.033
- [Maya] Tell you everything?

48:18.067 --> 48:19.827
- [Robert] Mm-hm.

48:19.862 --> 48:22.347
[Maya mumbles]

48:24.591 --> 48:25.661
I'm all ears.

48:30.355 --> 48:31.563
- [Hannah] I had no idea.

48:31.598 --> 48:32.323
I wouldn't have gone in.

48:32.357 --> 48:34.083
I let myself in.

48:34.118 --> 48:35.153
- [Poppy] Well you shouldn't
have left the flowers.

48:35.188 --> 48:37.224
- [Hannah] Where the hell did he
meet her?

48:37.259 --> 48:37.984
Who is it?

48:38.018 --> 48:39.157
- [Poppy] I don't know, Mum.

48:39.192 --> 48:40.227
- [Hannah] What a dick.

48:40.262 --> 48:41.746
- [Poppy] What does it matter,
Mum?

48:41.780 --> 48:44.162
- [Hannah] It matters
because he lied to us.

48:49.374 --> 48:51.963
[Poppy screams]

48:56.726 --> 48:58.694
- Oh, my father is very ill.

49:00.730 --> 49:02.870
He has cancer of the liver and
he's dying.

49:03.975 --> 49:05.528
What are you saying?

49:05.563 --> 49:07.461

- Mum!

- I'm so sorry.

49:13.226 --> 49:14.192
Oh my darling.

49:20.129 --> 49:21.165
- Ah.

49:23.719 --> 49:24.996
You're not gonna ask
me how I feel are you?

49:25.031 --> 49:26.549
- [Maya] How do you feel?

49:26.584 --> 49:28.034
- Oh, I feel fine, thank you.

49:28.068 --> 49:29.104
And you?

49:29.138 --> 49:29.897
- [Maya] I'm good.

49:29.932 --> 49:31.382
Thank you for asking.

49:31.416 --> 49:32.624
- This is wonderful.

49:32.659 --> 49:34.143
I've never been here before.

49:34.178 --> 49:35.179
- Yeah.

49:35.213 --> 49:35.973
Well it's much nicer
when there are

49:36.007 --> 49:37.526
no people around, you know.

49:37.560 --> 49:38.320
People make too much noise.

49:38.354 --> 49:40.184
Fish don't like noise.

49:40.218 --> 49:41.012
- Can they hear us?

49:41.047 --> 49:42.738

Ludwig. [fingers snap]

49:49.538 --> 49:51.402
You know he's a really
smart fish,

49:51.436 --> 49:53.956
much smarter than most of
the people that come here.

49:59.548 --> 50:04.242
Hey, I have tickets to this
concert,

50:04.277 --> 50:07.107
friends of friends, Indian
music.

50:08.281 --> 50:09.075
Can you come?

50:10.973 --> 50:12.216
- I'm not a prisoner.

50:12.250 --> 50:13.044
[Maya laughs]

50:13.079 --> 50:14.011
I'm allowed out.

50:14.045 --> 50:16.047
No, I feel much better.

50:16.082 --> 50:17.600
Only that's another illusion.

50:18.636 --> 50:20.017
Yeah, I can come.

51:11.482 --> 51:12.897
Please leave a message.

51:12.931 --> 51:13.656
- Ah.

51:13.691 --> 51:14.554
[phone beeps]

51:14.588 --> 51:15.486
Hannah?

51:15.520 --> 51:18.144
Hannah, pick up the fucking
phone.

51:18.178 --> 51:21.285
Jesus Christ, am I
allowed to have friends?

51:21.319 --> 51:22.734
Look, I'll finish this sculpture

51:22.769 --> 51:25.668
and I'll play all the money I
owe you.

51:25.703 --> 51:27.222
Look, you won't have to worry
much longer.

51:27.256 --> 51:30.259
I've got officially three months
left.

51:30.294 --> 51:31.329
Oh, what a relief.

51:33.159 --> 51:34.470
- Why don't you ring him?

51:37.024 --> 51:37.922
- [Robert] Hannah?

51:37.956 --> 51:38.750
Hannah, pick up the phone.
- Oh shit.

51:38.785 --> 51:40.027
- Ring him, Mum.

51:41.167 --> 51:42.271
- I can't.

52:39.225 --> 52:40.881
- Ah, don't you have a key?

52:40.916 --> 52:43.298
- I've been told to respect your
privacy.

52:43.332 --> 52:44.402
- [Robert] That's ridiculous.

52:44.437 --> 52:45.576
- Where have you been?

52:46.508 --> 52:48.510
- Well, I had to go to the
studio first.

52:50.443 --> 52:53.515
I'm being auditioned as a
potential transplant recipient.

52:53.549 --> 52:54.585
- Oh.

52:54.619 --> 52:57.312
- I have to prove I'm of sound
mind.

52:57.346 --> 52:58.209
- That could be a problem.

52:58.244 --> 52:59.693
[Robert laughs]

52:59.728 --> 53:02.351
- They also talk about family
support.

53:02.386 --> 53:05.389
Who is my family these days?

53:05.423 --> 53:06.942
- [Poppy] Mum's just a bit
pissed off.

53:06.976 --> 53:07.770
- Yeah.

53:07.805 --> 53:09.324
- You know she can't help
herself.

53:09.358 --> 53:10.601
- Yeah.
- She cares a lot.

53:10.635 --> 53:12.396
- Yeah.

53:12.430 --> 53:13.638
How come you're so wise?

53:17.987 --> 53:20.231
- If you get on the list
how long does it take?

53:22.095 --> 53:24.442
- Ah well with cancer you've
only got

53:24.477 --> 53:25.857
a small chance to get on the
list

53:25.892 --> 53:29.482
and, well, even then you can die
waiting.

53:30.586 --> 53:32.623
There's just not that many
organs around.

53:33.589 --> 53:35.453
People don't like to donate
something

53:35.488 --> 53:37.766

next life.

- Huh, who?

53:54.610 --> 53:55.922
- Come on, lover boy.

53:57.199 --> 53:59.063
Answer my question.

53:59.097 --> 54:00.616
James said she's a stunning
blonde.

54:00.651 --> 54:04.102
- [chuckles] Well James is a
lunatic.

54:06.691 --> 54:09.418
You're gonna have to
teach me how to Skype.

54:09.453 --> 54:10.937
- When am I gonna meet her?

54:10.971 --> 54:12.179
- Who?

54:12.214 --> 54:13.008
- How old is she?

54:29.335 --> 54:31.475
- [Maya] How are you?

54:31.509 --> 54:34.340
- Well, this is my first Skype.

54:34.374 --> 54:35.548
I'm a bit apprehensive.

54:36.514 --> 54:39.310
- [Maya] Mm, so now you're
connected to the real world.

54:39.345 --> 54:43.521
- Well I was connected, just
didn't realize it. [chuckles]

54:45.661 --> 54:47.939
- Are you being well looked
after?

54:47.974 --> 54:51.080
- Well my ex-wife, my daughter,
they've been too good to me.

54:52.565 --> 54:54.152
What would I do without them?

54:57.363 --> 55:01.953
If I kiss the screen and you
kiss it, too, will we connect?

55:01.988 --> 55:04.542

before?

57:06.181 --> 57:07.734
Why now?

57:07.769 --> 57:09.943
I could have loved her.

57:09.978 --> 57:12.221
I could have loved her like mad.

57:13.809 --> 57:15.949
I can't live like this.

57:15.984 --> 57:17.226
I mustn't see her again.

57:19.505 --> 57:21.645
Oh I love her, damn it.

my body.

58:10.728 --> 58:12.696
I'm riddled with cancer, I'm
sure of it.

58:12.730 --> 58:14.180
It's everywhere.

58:15.733 --> 58:17.252
I have to draw now.

58:17.286 --> 58:18.667
I can't finish my sculpture.

Hi, just take a seat.

- [Hannah] Okay.

59:10.892 --> 59:13.791
[woman chattering]

59:15.621 --> 59:17.105
- It's very good that you
brought the family, Robert.

59:17.139 --> 59:17.899
- [Robert] The surgeon won't see
you

59:17.933 --> 59:19.314
unless you bring your family.

59:19.348 --> 59:21.592
- Good, bad, or indifferent
that the family's with you.

59:21.627 --> 59:22.800
- [Robert] what is a family?

59:22.835 --> 59:24.388
- [Surgeon] Now in this case--

59:24.422 --> 59:26.114
- [Robert] I wish Maya was with
me.

59:26.148 --> 59:27.702
- [Surgeon] Speaking of my--

59:27.736 --> 59:28.772
- [Robert] A transplant's
the only chance I have.

59:28.806 --> 59:29.600
I know that.

59:31.429 --> 59:33.604
Don't know what he's saying.

59:33.639 --> 59:34.467
Can't hear him.

59:35.675 --> 59:36.883
- [Surgeon] However, in this
case--

59:36.918 --> 59:39.610
- [Robert] Why is Hannah
sitting in the middle?

59:39.645 --> 59:40.922
I want to sit next to Poppy.

59:41.854 --> 59:43.372
Oh, it's too late, too late.

59:44.201 --> 59:47.169
- And in this case it is good
news.

59:47.204 --> 59:50.069
That is to say you've been
activated.

59:50.103 --> 59:52.623
We've put you on the transplant
list.

59:52.658 --> 59:54.038

be late for work?

01:01:11.771 --> 01:01:13.739
I'm here, you're here, we're
here.

01:01:15.464 --> 01:01:17.846
Let me just make you a coffee.

01:01:21.747 --> 01:01:23.921
Oh, it stinks in here, darling.

01:01:23.956 --> 01:01:26.096
I have to open the windows.

01:01:26.130 --> 01:01:29.582
[soft orchestral music]

01:01:30.756 --> 01:01:31.584
- [Robert] Dad and I didn't talk

01:01:31.618 --> 01:01:33.724
for years after Mother died.

01:01:33.759 --> 01:01:34.760
- [Louise] I was going to ask
you--

01:01:34.794 --> 01:01:35.830
- [Robert] I don't know why.

01:01:35.864 --> 01:01:37.555
- You chose marine biology?

01:01:37.590 --> 01:01:38.798
- [Robert] I still miss her.

01:01:40.489 --> 01:01:44.114
"If anything ever happens
to you I wouldn't survive,"

01:01:44.148 --> 01:01:45.253
she once told me.

01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:47.704
She had cancer.

01:01:49.222 --> 01:01:50.879
I think about her all the time.

01:01:52.087 --> 01:01:54.227
"Family now, it's important,"

01:01:54.262 --> 01:01:55.125
Dad tells me.

01:01:56.678 --> 01:01:58.128
Now he hugs me.

01:01:58.162 --> 01:01:59.854
But he still can't talk
about my relationship

01:01:59.888 --> 01:02:02.339
with Maya even
in the face of death.

01:02:03.754 --> 01:02:04.651
"Hannah's family."

01:02:04.686 --> 01:02:06.308
"Yes, of course she is."

01:02:06.343 --> 01:02:08.621
Then Maya asked him
about Louise.

01:02:08.655 --> 01:02:10.761
- So, how did you meet?

01:02:11.693 --> 01:02:14.489
- Well, I was at this dinner
party

01:02:15.352 --> 01:02:19.149
and some of us carrying
on about Star Wars.

01:02:19.183 --> 01:02:20.115
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah.

01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:21.807
What an important film it was at
the time

01:02:21.841 --> 01:02:26.915
and how it had changed our
concept of war and space,

01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:29.884
and then someone raved on
about those space creatures,

01:02:29.918 --> 01:02:32.300
pointing their obscene guns at
one another

01:02:32.334 --> 01:02:34.785
and shooting at everyone
and everything in sight.

01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:37.201
And then Louise said something
like,

01:02:38.099 --> 01:02:40.480
"Why didn't they make Star
Peace?

01:02:41.827 --> 01:02:45.969
"Why take these silly games
of war we have here on Earth

01:02:46.003 --> 01:02:49.006
"into space and continue
the madness up there?"

01:02:50.042 --> 01:02:53.114
- It was a bit more
complicated, but [chuckles]...

01:02:53.148 --> 01:02:54.632
- I rang her the next day.

01:02:55.668 --> 01:02:56.807
Didn't I?

01:02:56.842 --> 01:02:57.635
- Aww.

01:02:57.670 --> 01:02:59.499
- Well, that was it.

01:02:59.534 --> 01:03:02.537
- That's amazing.
- That's our story.

01:03:05.851 --> 01:03:08.992
[ominous ambient music]

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.520
[traditional Indian music]

01:03:54.347 --> 01:03:57.040
[water sloshing]

01:04:03.115 --> 01:04:06.739
[Maya chattering]

01:04:06.773 --> 01:04:07.740
- Well who lives a normal life?

01:04:07.774 --> 01:04:09.190
Nobody lives a normal life.

01:04:10.916 --> 01:04:13.435
Well maybe in hospital they do.

01:04:13.470 --> 01:04:15.161
- [Maya] Why?

01:04:15.196 --> 01:04:17.957
- Well because in hospital
everybody gives and nobody
takes.

01:04:19.062 --> 01:04:20.477
They're very kind to me there.

01:04:21.788 --> 01:04:25.171
- You know Uncle used
to say kindness covered

01:04:25.206 --> 01:04:27.001
all his political beliefs.

01:04:27.035 --> 01:04:28.105
- Ah.

01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:28.968
- Hm.

01:04:30.107 --> 01:04:31.557
It requires a
great deal of kindness

01:04:31.591 --> 01:04:33.145
to be a doorman,
don't you think?

01:04:34.318 --> 01:04:36.079
- Yeah.

01:04:36.113 --> 01:04:38.357
The idea that somebody has
to die in order to save me

01:04:38.391 --> 01:04:40.152
I find absolutely appalling.

01:04:43.086 --> 01:04:45.536
Right now with you
I feel really strong.

01:04:45.571 --> 01:04:47.780
When I'm not
I feel quite vulnerable.

01:04:52.509 --> 01:04:55.167
- I like my men to be
vulnerable.

01:04:57.617 --> 01:04:59.136
- Thiruvananthapuram.

01:04:59.171 --> 01:05:01.828
[Maya laughs]

01:05:07.006 --> 01:05:11.321
- What will you do when I
return home, when I'm gone?

01:05:15.014 --> 01:05:17.430
- I'll come and I'll find you.

01:05:17.465 --> 01:05:21.124
I'll come and I'll find
you wherever you are.

01:05:26.992 --> 01:05:29.649
[wings flapping]

01:05:40.005 --> 01:05:40.937
- Is that you?

01:05:42.973 --> 01:05:43.732
- Yes.

01:05:45.148 --> 01:05:46.218
- All of you?

01:05:47.736 --> 01:05:48.530
- Yes.

01:06:00.542 --> 01:06:03.235
[waves crashing]

01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:08.033
[wings flapping]

01:06:14.418 --> 01:06:17.145
[waves crashing]

01:06:30.262 --> 01:06:33.713
[choral chanting music]

01:06:42.032 --> 01:06:43.723
- What are you doing?

01:06:45.070 --> 01:06:47.417
- [Maya] I'm dreaming, Auntie.

01:06:48.866 --> 01:06:50.351
- Dreaming of what?

01:06:53.043 --> 01:06:56.012
- [Maya] Of doors opening and
closing.

01:07:00.430 --> 01:07:02.397
- I think you are in love.

01:07:03.433 --> 01:07:04.951
Terribly in love.

01:07:07.299 --> 01:07:08.886
- [Maya] How did that happen?

01:07:10.095 --> 01:07:13.236
No one has ever made me shed
a tear or caused me pain.

01:07:15.445 --> 01:07:16.239
- No one?

01:07:17.619 --> 01:07:21.416
- They all did in a way,
but never touched me deeply.

01:07:25.903 --> 01:07:28.596
- [Maya's Aunt] When did
you know you loved him?

01:07:33.325 --> 01:07:34.774
- It was the music, Auntie.

01:07:36.293 --> 01:07:37.570
It's always the music.

01:07:39.089 --> 01:07:40.090
[visitor knocking]

01:07:40.125 --> 01:07:41.160
Auntie, just one sec, huh?

01:07:44.336 --> 01:07:45.130
Hi.

01:07:46.269 --> 01:07:47.442
How's the leg?

01:07:47.477 --> 01:07:49.410
- Oh, it's good thanks.

01:07:52.482 --> 01:07:53.241
Oh come.

01:07:53.276 --> 01:07:54.932
Come and sit down.

01:07:57.935 --> 01:07:59.075
- Ah, this is lovely.

01:08:00.352 --> 01:08:02.733
- Oh, thank you.

01:08:02.768 --> 01:08:05.288
Oh, Auntie said you should
keep your leg up all night.

01:08:05.322 --> 01:08:08.222
I told them about you.

01:08:08.256 --> 01:08:09.257
Come say hi.

01:08:10.362 --> 01:08:13.813
[ominous ambient music]

01:08:16.299 --> 01:08:19.198
[water sloshing]

01:08:48.296 --> 01:08:49.849
Uncle, it's me.

01:08:51.299 --> 01:08:52.404
- Maya, darling child.

01:08:58.305 --> 01:09:01.654
Death is a problem I'm not
familiar with.

01:09:06.487 --> 01:09:08.903
This is my friend, Robert.

01:09:08.937 --> 01:09:09.731
- Hello.

01:09:11.319 --> 01:09:12.493
- Is he your loved one?

01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:17.325
- It's not yet known.

01:09:20.569 --> 01:09:23.158
- The love that matters
connects through space

01:09:25.506 --> 01:09:27.059
and brings peace.

01:09:30.613 --> 01:09:31.752
One sees

01:09:34.446 --> 01:09:36.274
most activities of man

01:09:39.968 --> 01:09:40.899
are absurd.

01:09:52.084 --> 01:09:56.744
- Uncle was an enemy of the
state,

01:09:56.778 --> 01:10:01.266
of religion, of all conventional
thinking.

01:10:02.888 --> 01:10:07.893
He never accepted human
condition for what it is.

01:10:10.171 --> 01:10:12.484
He stalked our universe for
years.

01:10:16.281 --> 01:10:17.247
That made sense.

01:10:21.147 --> 01:10:25.738
He says, "Modern life is a
fraud,

01:10:28.293 --> 01:10:30.295
"has veiled man's spirit."

01:10:36.818 --> 01:10:38.958
He's kept us ready to go...

01:10:43.308 --> 01:10:44.101
beyond.

01:10:47.829 --> 01:10:50.936
- To find his true potential?

01:10:50.970 --> 01:10:53.456
- Yes, to find the sublime.

01:10:56.976 --> 01:11:00.256
[somber ambient music]

01:11:25.453 --> 01:11:28.353
[water sloshing]

01:11:30.838 --> 01:11:34.324
[mystical ambient music]

01:12:04.423 --> 01:12:05.493
- [Maya's Uncle] Every galaxy

01:12:05.528 --> 01:12:08.254
has a massive black hole at its
center.

01:12:09.911 --> 01:12:13.018
The gravity is so strong that
nothing

01:12:13.052 --> 01:12:15.848
can escape its pull, not even
light.

01:12:23.442 --> 01:12:26.272
Time and space are interrelated,

01:12:27.412 --> 01:12:29.448
forming a single continuum.

01:12:30.518 --> 01:12:32.900
Space, time.

01:12:38.699 --> 01:12:40.563
All organic matters in nature.

01:12:41.598 --> 01:12:43.876
The body and universe relate

01:12:46.534 --> 01:12:48.087
and that is understood.

01:12:49.537 --> 01:12:51.436
Life and death merge and become
one.

01:12:54.922 --> 01:12:58.339
[choral chanting music]

01:13:27.506 --> 01:13:31.199
[high-pitched ambient music]

01:13:56.984 --> 01:14:00.401
[choral chanting music]

01:14:07.063 --> 01:14:09.168
[Robert breathing heavily]

01:14:09.203 --> 01:14:10.446
- Why didn't you let me
come and pick you up?

01:14:11.688 --> 01:14:13.966
- I just felt like having a
walk.

01:14:29.361 --> 01:14:31.018
- Well dinner's nearly ready.

01:14:31.052 --> 01:14:31.846
- Thank you.

01:14:35.505 --> 01:14:37.921
[Hannah sighs]

01:15:05.293 --> 01:15:08.573
[Hannah clears throat]

01:15:11.472 --> 01:15:12.231
- Ow, ah.

01:15:12.266 --> 01:15:14.648
[pan thuds]

01:15:14.682 --> 01:15:15.441
[phone ringing]
- I'm sorry,

01:15:15.476 --> 01:15:16.581
I'm not that hungry, Hannah.

01:15:16.615 --> 01:15:19.238
- No, you have to eat to
keep up your strength.

01:15:21.068 --> 01:15:21.896
Simon.

01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:28.316
Hola. [speaking in foreign
language]

01:15:37.705 --> 01:15:40.087

[ominous ambient music]

[egg splattering]

01:15:54.826 --> 01:15:56.621
[butcher knife thuds]

01:15:56.655 --> 01:15:59.831
[wheelbarrow squeaking]

[creatures chattering]

01:16:37.662 --> 01:16:40.492
[Robert groaning]

01:16:43.357 --> 01:16:44.151
Shh.

01:16:45.670 --> 01:16:48.811
[Robert groans]
Shh.

01:16:51.572 --> 01:16:53.470
- You must be Poppy.

01:16:53.505 --> 01:16:54.955
- Yes.

01:16:54.989 --> 01:16:56.784
Dad really wanted me to meet
you.

01:16:57.785 --> 01:16:58.717
He's not feeling great.

01:17:05.724 --> 01:17:07.795
I came to the aquarium
once with my school.

01:17:07.830 --> 01:17:09.176
- [Maya] Oh.

01:17:09.210 --> 01:17:10.487
- Bonjour.
- Hi, bonjour.

01:17:10.522 --> 01:17:11.868
[speaking in foreign language]
cappuccino?

01:17:11.903 --> 01:17:12.731
- [Barista] [speaking in
foreign language] cappuccino.

01:17:12.766 --> 01:17:13.456
- [Poppy] We had to write an
essay

01:17:13.490 --> 01:17:15.009
about our favorite sea animal.

01:17:15.044 --> 01:17:16.286
- Ah.

01:17:16.321 --> 01:17:18.461
And what was yours?

01:17:18.495 --> 01:17:20.187
- The seahorses.

01:17:20.221 --> 01:17:21.706
- Ah, they're very sweet.

01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:23.466
Good choice.

01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:26.331
There's this big shark here
that I've become friends with

01:17:26.365 --> 01:17:28.022
and he listens to me.

01:17:29.403 --> 01:17:30.162
I don't know if he
really likes me, though.

01:17:30.197 --> 01:17:32.682
[women laugh]

01:17:36.997 --> 01:17:38.723
Robert talks about you a lot.

01:17:40.828 --> 01:17:42.588
You're his best friend, he says.

01:17:44.763 --> 01:17:47.145
- We've always been really
close.

01:17:47.179 --> 01:17:50.217
It's a genetic disorder.
[chuckles]

01:17:51.528 --> 01:17:52.633
He wanted me,

01:17:54.773 --> 01:17:55.671
he told me,

01:17:57.258 --> 01:17:58.087
he loves you.

01:18:00.261 --> 01:18:02.919
He said, "Just in case."

01:18:05.439 --> 01:18:08.442
He's mad about you. [crying]

01:18:12.964 --> 01:18:17.037
I'll ask you one more
time, please be my friend.

01:18:17.071 --> 01:18:19.384
- [Man] Right, now you've made
me mad.

01:18:19.418 --> 01:18:21.075
I'm gonna pinch you on the nose.

01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:22.525
- [Poppy] Oh!

01:18:22.559 --> 01:18:23.526
Ah. Ah.

01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:24.838
- What's going on?
- Ah! Ah!

01:18:24.872 --> 01:18:26.771
Choo!
[water squirting]

01:18:26.805 --> 01:18:28.220
[everyone laughs]

01:18:28.255 --> 01:18:29.014
- [Man] That was funny.

01:18:29.049 --> 01:18:30.188
Do it again, do it again!

01:18:30.222 --> 01:18:33.743
- [Poppy] Ah choo! [laughs]

01:18:33.778 --> 01:18:36.746
[audience applauds]

01:18:45.617 --> 01:18:48.931
- [Robert] She's a wonderful
woman, my daughter.

01:18:49.966 --> 01:18:51.105
My daughter the puppeteer.

01:18:54.488 --> 01:18:55.282
- Hi, Dad.

01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:04.843
[Robert wheezing]

01:19:08.847 --> 01:19:09.917
You okay?

01:19:10.953 --> 01:19:11.954
[Robert wheezing]

01:19:11.988 --> 01:19:12.748
Sit, sit.

01:19:19.547 --> 01:19:20.652
- Well, I've,

01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:22.758
I've done my will.

01:19:23.793 --> 01:19:24.829
It's all organized.

01:19:27.003 --> 01:19:28.522
- What are you willing away?

01:19:30.696 --> 01:19:31.628
- All my fortune.

01:19:32.526 --> 01:19:34.977
[Poppy laughs]

01:19:35.011 --> 01:19:36.668
- if there's no fortune.

01:19:38.843 --> 01:19:39.844
Then why leave a will?

01:19:42.053 --> 01:19:42.847
- Well there's some old hammers.

01:19:44.365 --> 01:19:47.023
There's some
rolls of sticky tape.

01:19:47.058 --> 01:19:48.887
There's tools.

01:19:49.888 --> 01:19:51.821
[Poppy laughs]
Broken clocks.

01:19:51.856 --> 01:19:54.203
There's my assortment of
screwdrivers.

01:19:55.825 --> 01:19:57.516
There's some fine rubbish.

01:20:01.866 --> 01:20:03.522
Yeah, lots of hard work.

01:20:06.905 --> 01:20:08.044
- You mean your work.

01:20:13.912 --> 01:20:15.880
- You know, most artists think
that their work's important.

01:20:17.882 --> 01:20:18.675
- Do you?

01:20:20.194 --> 01:20:23.266
- Well this proves that I've
lived.

01:20:24.543 --> 01:20:28.858
That I've existed, huh?
[Poppy chuckles]

01:20:28.893 --> 01:20:30.170
- What about me?

01:20:30.204 --> 01:20:32.068
- Oh.
[both laugh]

01:20:32.103 --> 01:20:33.414
I almost forgot.

01:20:33.449 --> 01:20:34.691
You, my precious...

01:20:37.902 --> 01:20:39.317
You are my life.

01:20:39.351 --> 01:20:42.354
[Poppy crying]
Yeah.

01:20:44.736 --> 01:20:46.807
Forever waiting for the hospital
to ring.

01:20:49.914 --> 01:20:52.019
And now I'm slowly traveling
backwards.

01:20:54.401 --> 01:20:55.195
I feel so alone.

01:20:56.886 --> 01:20:58.060
Except when Maya's with me.

01:21:00.027 --> 01:21:03.065
Why does Hannah still
have a problem with her?

01:21:03.099 --> 01:21:04.376
I'll be dead in a few weeks.

01:21:06.896 --> 01:21:08.760
Soon that tree'll start to
blossom,

01:21:10.072 --> 01:21:11.659
like the pear tree from my
youth.

01:21:12.902 --> 01:21:14.628
There was one in the garden
next-door

01:21:15.491 --> 01:21:20.047
and every spring petals would
cross the rusty old fence

01:21:21.428 --> 01:21:24.500
and dance down the garden
like silent snowflakes.

01:21:26.088 --> 01:21:28.055
As a child I'd catch those
petals.

01:21:29.056 --> 01:21:32.266
They'd vanish in the palm of my
hands.

01:21:32.301 --> 01:21:35.994
[traditional Indian music]

01:21:47.419 --> 01:21:49.801
Maya insisted I come
with her to the ocean.

01:21:50.975 --> 01:21:53.978
"The ocean will wash away
all wounds," she says.

01:21:57.602 --> 01:22:00.294
Five months into the
waiting game I'm still here.

01:22:02.089 --> 01:22:03.194
My legs hurt terribly.

01:22:04.954 --> 01:22:06.680
Can't drive too far out of the
city.

01:22:08.130 --> 01:22:10.649
Somebody could be dying right
now

01:22:10.684 --> 01:22:12.617
on this very road we've traveled
on.

01:22:13.687 --> 01:22:14.999
And they may call for me.

01:22:16.621 --> 01:22:21.626
[traditional Indian music]
[singing in foreign language]

01:23:24.068 --> 01:23:26.932
[waves lapping]

01:23:29.073 --> 01:23:32.041
[Robert crying out]

01:23:32.076 --> 01:23:35.113
[Robert groaning]

01:23:37.219 --> 01:23:38.772
- Sir, can you move it?

01:23:38.806 --> 01:23:40.256
- No, it hurts.

01:23:40.291 --> 01:23:43.225
No, it's hurting badly. [groans]

01:23:43.259 --> 01:23:46.090
[ominous ambient music]

01:23:46.124 --> 01:23:48.954
[Robert grunting]

01:24:16.258 --> 01:24:17.052
Maya.

01:24:18.846 --> 01:24:19.640
Maya.

01:24:21.642 --> 01:24:22.436
Ah.

01:24:24.300 --> 01:24:28.442
I just went on the most
incredible journey

01:24:28.477 --> 01:24:32.136
to another century,
another country.

01:24:33.516 --> 01:24:35.173
You were there.

01:24:40.247 --> 01:24:41.455
- [Maya] How is the pain?

01:24:43.008 --> 01:24:43.837
- It's better.

01:24:46.426 --> 01:24:48.255
- [Maya] How does pain get
better?

01:24:48.290 --> 01:24:50.154
[both chuckle]

01:24:50.188 --> 01:24:51.189
- No, it is.

01:24:57.540 --> 01:24:59.301
- The doctor says your immunity
is down

01:24:59.335 --> 01:25:02.304
and you have an infection there.

01:25:04.168 --> 01:25:05.824
They're trying to find out what
it is,

01:25:07.205 --> 01:25:08.620
get you back on your feet.

01:25:13.556 --> 01:25:14.626
- When do you leave?

01:25:16.180 --> 01:25:17.215
- Tomorrow.

01:25:18.389 --> 01:25:20.460
Uncle doesn't have much time.

01:25:20.494 --> 01:25:21.737
He's waiting.

01:25:29.331 --> 01:25:30.194
- I love you.

01:25:33.404 --> 01:25:37.753
Remember, wherever you are I'll
find you.

01:25:41.205 --> 01:25:44.656
[traditional Indian music]

01:26:10.061 --> 01:26:12.374
Eh, coulda been gone by
now but I'm still here.

01:26:14.445 --> 01:26:16.447
Loving madly and sadly.

01:26:20.554 --> 01:26:23.212
Oh, I've been dreaming of
hope and the feeling of hope.

01:26:26.595 --> 01:26:29.494
Always moving towards a central
point.

01:26:29.529 --> 01:26:31.669
The village square, the center
of town,

01:26:31.703 --> 01:26:32.946
the heart of the matter.

01:26:33.878 --> 01:26:35.224
- Hi, babe.
- Hi.

01:26:36.467 --> 01:26:38.227
- [Robert] But when I arrive the
center

01:26:38.262 --> 01:26:39.780
is always further away.

01:26:44.095 --> 01:26:46.270
Why is everybody so kind?

01:26:47.754 --> 01:26:49.238
That's not a good sign.

01:26:49.273 --> 01:26:50.688
I need to get out of here.

01:26:50.722 --> 01:26:52.103
I need to live.

01:26:52.137 --> 01:26:54.554
I need to meet Maya
somewhere to be with her,

01:26:54.588 --> 01:26:57.246
to live with her,
and die with her.

01:27:05.496 --> 01:27:08.119
[phone ringing]

01:27:12.779 --> 01:27:14.470
- [Nurse] Sorry to bother you,
Doctor,

01:27:14.505 --> 01:27:17.266
but Mrs. Brody, she's very ill

01:27:17.301 --> 01:27:19.406
and she wants me to
disconnect all support.

01:27:19.441 --> 01:27:20.407
- [Doctor] Why is that?

01:27:20.442 --> 01:27:24.377
- Well, she wants to see her
daughter,

01:27:24.411 --> 01:27:26.379
but she doesn't want
her daughter to see her

01:27:26.413 --> 01:27:28.726
or remember her as a patient.

01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:30.279
- [Doctor] How old is her
daughter?

01:27:30.314 --> 01:27:32.143
- 10 or 12 I think.

01:27:32.177 --> 01:27:34.283
- [Doctor] Is Sister Rankin
around at all?

01:27:34.318 --> 01:27:35.457
- No, she's gone to lunch.

01:27:35.491 --> 01:27:36.423
- [Doctor] Okay, be quick.

01:27:36.458 --> 01:27:37.252
- Okay.

01:28:19.155 --> 01:28:20.295
- It's all right, sweetheart.

01:28:21.365 --> 01:28:22.814
[girl crying]

01:28:22.849 --> 01:28:24.299
I'm getting better.

01:28:26.404 --> 01:28:27.405
I'll be home soon.

01:28:28.337 --> 01:28:29.511
- [Girl] Yeah.

01:28:30.374 --> 01:28:31.375
- Home soon.

01:28:32.514 --> 01:28:35.689
[girl crying]

01:28:35.724 --> 01:28:36.863
My darling.

01:28:39.693 --> 01:28:41.281
You must go now.

01:28:44.008 --> 01:28:45.768
My darling sweetheart.

01:28:53.293 --> 01:28:55.295
Daddy's waiting for you.

01:29:06.548 --> 01:29:11.553
[Mrs. Brody crying]
[machine beeping]

01:29:21.528 --> 01:29:24.876
[heartbeat thumping]

01:29:24.911 --> 01:29:27.603
[water sloshing]

01:29:29.778 --> 01:29:32.919
[somber piano music]

01:30:20.518 --> 01:30:23.072
- It isn't Christmas yet, Poppy.

01:30:23.107 --> 01:30:24.626
You know I'm not a fan.

01:30:24.660 --> 01:30:26.421
- Christmas is fun.

01:30:29.527 --> 01:30:31.598
I've got Maya's Christmas
present in the car.

01:30:34.946 --> 01:30:35.706
- What present?

01:30:37.639 --> 01:30:40.573
- You're not allowed to
open it until Christmas.

01:30:40.607 --> 01:30:41.746
[both chuckle]

01:30:41.781 --> 01:30:43.645
- Well, I don't think I'll last
that long.

01:30:44.542 --> 01:30:46.475
- How do you know?

01:30:46.510 --> 01:30:50.514
- Oh the waiting game,
it gives you insight.

01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:54.379
- You're gonna be all right,
Dad.

01:30:55.346 --> 01:30:56.554
You'll get a transplant.

01:30:58.038 --> 01:30:59.419
I'm sure you will.

01:31:00.524 --> 01:31:03.423
- Yeah well, they say that
Christmas is a good time for...

01:31:07.634 --> 01:31:08.808
That's a dreadful thought.

01:31:12.674 --> 01:31:13.675
I wouldn't see Easter they told
me

01:31:13.709 --> 01:31:15.366
and now it's almost Christmas.

01:31:17.506 --> 01:31:19.163
I'm still here, my darling
Poppy.

01:31:21.993 --> 01:31:23.512
And back on the waiting list.

01:31:24.686 --> 01:31:28.137
Please, Father Christmas,
can I have three snowflakes,

01:31:28.172 --> 01:31:31.382
five raindrops, a large passing
cloud,

01:31:31.416 --> 01:31:33.418
and maybe, maybe could you throw
in

01:31:33.453 --> 01:31:35.351
a new liver, medium sized?

01:31:37.906 --> 01:31:40.425
- Here ya go.

01:31:40.460 --> 01:31:42.704
- Oh.
[Poppy chuckles]

01:31:42.738 --> 01:31:44.602
I've never loved like this in my
life.

01:31:49.745 --> 01:31:52.403
Don't tell her I've opened it.

01:32:06.624 --> 01:32:07.694
Oh.

01:32:09.903 --> 01:32:12.561
[bird chirping]

01:32:12.596 --> 01:32:15.978
[somber orchestral music]

01:32:35.170 --> 01:32:38.760
- When Uncle is gone
everything will change.

01:32:40.485 --> 01:32:41.832
- Life moves on.

01:32:45.663 --> 01:32:49.564
Thousands of candles can be
lit from one single candle.

01:32:51.980 --> 01:32:56.467
And the life of that
candle won't be shortened.

01:32:56.501 --> 01:33:00.057
Hm? [chuckles]

01:33:00.091 --> 01:33:02.956
[children humming]

01:33:16.867 --> 01:33:18.040
Love remains.

01:33:21.043 --> 01:33:24.599
All that Uncle has received
from life passes on.

01:33:27.843 --> 01:33:30.812
It won't be wasted through
death, huh?

01:33:41.063 --> 01:33:43.997
[children humming]

01:34:02.084 --> 01:34:05.398
[water sloshing]

01:34:05.432 --> 01:34:06.675
- [Robert] Dad and Louise
have gone out of their way

01:34:06.710 --> 01:34:09.160
to make us all have
Christmas dinner together.

01:34:09.195 --> 01:34:10.506
It's never happened before.

01:34:10.541 --> 01:34:11.542
It's the first time.

01:34:12.716 --> 01:34:15.753
Dad's become warm and loving.

01:34:18.066 --> 01:34:19.654
Will this be our last supper?

01:34:20.931 --> 01:34:23.036
Oh, can't alter my thoughts.

01:34:23.071 --> 01:34:24.555
It feels strange.

01:34:24.589 --> 01:34:26.833
[family chattering]

01:34:26.868 --> 01:34:27.662
[phone ringing]
- Is there some reason

01:34:27.696 --> 01:34:29.594
why you put orange in it?

01:34:29.629 --> 01:34:30.665
- Yeah.

01:34:30.699 --> 01:34:32.356
- It's already really sweet
already.

01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:33.909
- [Robert] Hello?

01:34:33.944 --> 01:34:34.738
[Louise laughs]

01:34:34.772 --> 01:34:35.842
Hello?
- It's lovely.

01:34:35.877 --> 01:34:36.843
- [Maya] Hello, darling.

01:34:36.878 --> 01:34:37.741
- Ah, Maya.

01:34:39.397 --> 01:34:40.813
Hey, it's lovely to hear your
voice.

01:34:40.847 --> 01:34:42.262
How are you?

01:34:42.297 --> 01:34:43.712
- [Maya] I'm fine.

01:34:43.747 --> 01:34:45.334
Merry Christmas.

01:34:45.369 --> 01:34:47.440
- [chuckles] Merry Christmas to
you, too.

01:34:48.924 --> 01:34:50.374
Thank you for Vincent.

01:34:51.306 --> 01:34:52.687
- Aw.
- He's beautiful.

01:34:52.721 --> 01:34:53.860
- [Maya] You're welcome.

01:34:53.895 --> 01:34:56.207
So, what are you up to?

01:34:56.242 --> 01:34:59.245
- Well, I don't normally
celebrate Christmas,

01:34:59.279 --> 01:35:02.904
but Dad and Louise have
put on a Christmas dinner.

01:35:02.938 --> 01:35:05.838
It's highly unusual but it's
lovely.
