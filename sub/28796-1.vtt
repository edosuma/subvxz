00:00.935 --> 00:03.002
         (wine pouring)

00:08.943 --> 00:11.010
         (glass clinks)

00:22.957 --> 00:25.624
         (film rolling)

00:44.979 --> 00:46.378
       (female sniffling)

00:47.314 --> 00:48.213
             - I...

00:49.383 --> 00:50.582
 I'm not gonna do this anymore.

00:50.584 --> 00:51.850
   I cannot do this anymore.

00:51.852 --> 00:54.720
     I am tired, I am done.

00:56.190 --> 00:57.256
           Well done.

01:08.569 --> 01:11.870
       I am not going to
     let him take my soul!

01:13.808 --> 01:17.509
       (thunder cracking)

01:17.511 --> 01:19.511
      If I'm gonna go I'm
        gonna go my way.

01:28.956 --> 01:31.690
        (pills rattling)

01:47.341 --> 01:52.411
       (heavy breathing)
       (thunder cracking)

01:57.418 --> 02:00.252
        (woman groaning)

02:20.574 --> 02:23.308
        (door creaking)

02:48.302 --> 02:51.603
         (low growling)

02:51.605 --> 02:52.504
            Christ.

02:55.910 --> 02:58.810
       (woman screaming)

03:00.948 --> 03:03.582
         (low growling)

03:44.058 --> 03:46.725
         (bed creaking)

04:06.280 --> 04:09.281
       (thunder cracking)

04:28.402 --> 04:33.405
        (skull cracking)
       (woman screaming)

05:15.916 --> 05:18.650
        (ominous music)

05:26.327 --> 05:29.061
        (loud thudding)

05:56.023 --> 05:58.690
         (somber music)

06:31.458 --> 06:34.459
        (monitor static)

06:34.461 --> 06:35.427
       - Hello everyone.

06:37.030 --> 06:40.031
  My name is Rebecca Clarkson

06:40.033 --> 06:41.299
           and today,

06:42.736 --> 06:45.437
       well actually, for
      the rest of the week

06:45.439 --> 06:48.507
     I'm gonna do be doing
      something different.

06:48.509 --> 06:51.910
        Something that I
      haven't done before

06:51.912 --> 06:53.578
         but I have to.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.949
     It's the only way that
      I'm gonna get people

06:57.951 --> 07:01.720
  to believe me and my story.

07:03.524 --> 07:07.159
First off, this is not a movie.

07:07.161 --> 07:09.194
      I am not an actress.

07:10.998 --> 07:14.866
       Everything you are
       gonna see is real.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.337
        Now let's start
      from the beginning.

07:21.108 --> 07:25.744
      I've decided to take
        this opportunity

07:25.746 --> 07:27.712
      and document myself.

07:29.450 --> 07:31.817
  I've been to a psychiatrist,

07:31.819 --> 07:34.886
I've talked to several priests,

07:34.888 --> 07:38.223
    and no one believes me.

07:39.726 --> 07:42.894
So I'm taping myself for proof.

07:44.531 --> 07:46.832
     It all started when I
     was messing with this.

07:46.834 --> 07:49.568
        (ominous music)

07:51.605 --> 07:53.071
          Big mistake.

07:56.543 --> 07:58.677
       It was only a few
      days ago that I was

07:58.679 --> 08:00.045
 messing with this Ouija board

08:00.047 --> 08:02.280
   and it was out of boredom.

08:04.184 --> 08:06.885
      Days later, strange
   things started happening.

08:09.089 --> 08:12.924
         I'm so scared.
       (Rebecca sobbing)

08:12.926 --> 08:14.626
  I haven't been feeling well.

08:15.929 --> 08:17.729
       I've been hearing
        things at night.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.999
        I haven't had a
      decent nights sleep

08:21.001 --> 08:22.200
     since it all started.

08:25.606 --> 08:28.106
 So this is the only way that I

08:28.108 --> 08:31.877
    can prove to people that
  demonic possession is real.

08:38.818 --> 08:41.653
      You may be wondering
        why I don't just

08:42.523 --> 08:44.256
       leave this house.

08:46.527 --> 08:48.627
  Well, it's not that simple.

08:48.629 --> 08:51.563
 Everywhere I go it follows me.

08:56.703 --> 09:00.405
      I'm gonna be calling
    this the Video Diaries.

09:01.542 --> 09:03.174
    The Possession Diaries.

09:04.111 --> 09:06.645
 Starting with today, day one.

09:06.647 --> 09:11.182
  And right now it's 8:15 am.

09:12.719 --> 09:13.585
            Alright.

09:15.756 --> 09:18.990
     I'm gonna try and get
    some much needed sleep.

09:20.027 --> 09:21.459
  I'll talk to you guys later.

09:22.329 --> 09:23.194
              Bye.

09:31.805 --> 09:33.138
           Hey guys.

09:33.140 --> 09:36.541
         It's 12:45 pm.

09:38.178 --> 09:42.047
       I've been tossing
     and turning in my bed

09:42.049 --> 09:43.949
      since we last spoke.

09:43.951 --> 09:46.051
      I can't go to sleep.

09:47.254 --> 09:48.820
      It's hard because--

09:48.822 --> 09:50.388
        (door knocking)

09:50.390 --> 09:51.289
            Hold on.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.058
            Come in!

09:55.429 --> 09:56.261
     - [Girl At Door] Hey.

09:56.263 --> 09:57.796
             - Hey.

09:57.798 --> 09:59.831
   - Who are you talking to?

09:59.833 --> 10:00.732
           - Nobody.

10:01.969 --> 10:03.034
         - Nobody huh?

10:05.639 --> 10:07.305
      What are you doing?

10:07.307 --> 10:08.340
       Is this thing on?

10:09.910 --> 10:12.877
        - Yeah, I'm just
     making a video diary.

10:13.880 --> 10:15.347
        - A video diary?

10:15.349 --> 10:16.581
            - Yeah.

10:16.583 --> 10:18.516
     - Are you gonna put it
    on YouTube or something?

10:18.518 --> 10:22.287
    - Yeah, YouTube, Vimeo,
      Google, everywhere.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.588
            - What!

10:23.590 --> 10:25.256
            Rebecca!

10:25.258 --> 10:26.224
            - What?

10:26.226 --> 10:27.359
 - I don't have any makeup on.

10:27.361 --> 10:29.060
          - Yeah, so?

10:29.062 --> 10:31.663
   - So I don't want my face
     all over the internet.

10:31.665 --> 10:33.064
         - Esmy, relax.

10:33.066 --> 10:35.500
    - No, no, are you really
     gonna put this online?

10:36.703 --> 10:38.737
   - Stop being so dramatic.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.843
    - Fine, just when you do

10:44.845 --> 10:46.111
  whatever it is you're doing,

10:46.113 --> 10:48.780
      can you edit me out
       of the final cut?

10:48.782 --> 10:50.315
            - Okay.

10:50.317 --> 10:51.883
            - Cool.

10:51.885 --> 10:55.086
      Oh, so, the original
   purpose for coming in here

10:55.088 --> 10:56.788
      was to tell you that
       I'm actually going

10:56.790 --> 10:58.657
  out of town for a few days.

10:58.659 --> 10:59.758
     Just to visit family.

11:00.927 --> 11:03.194
         - I'm gonna be
      here all by myself?

11:03.196 --> 11:05.630
      - You have Dante to
       keep you company.

11:05.632 --> 11:07.298
       - Yeah, but still.

11:07.300 --> 11:09.567
- It's just until your birthday.

11:09.569 --> 11:12.170
     - On Halloween, that's
       six days from now.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.371
           - I know.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.273
      But we'll celebrate
        when I get back.

11:16.610 --> 11:17.909
           - Alright.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.411
 Well in that case I can wait.

11:19.413 --> 11:20.645
            - Great.

11:20.647 --> 11:22.280
       So I'll leave the
      number on the fridge

11:22.282 --> 11:23.748
     and I'll see you then.

11:23.750 --> 11:24.916
            - Okay.

11:24.918 --> 11:26.184
           Have fun.

11:26.186 --> 11:27.018
            Be safe.

11:27.020 --> 11:27.886
       - [Esmy] You too.

11:29.322 --> 11:30.155
            - Okay.

11:30.157 --> 11:30.922
             - Bye.

11:30.924 --> 11:31.790
             - Bye.

11:45.672 --> 11:46.671
           Hey guys.

11:49.476 --> 11:53.378
         It's 8:33 pm.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.180
       I have to go pee.

11:58.351 --> 12:00.685
       I know, sorry, too
       much information,

12:00.687 --> 12:03.021
        but every detail
       counts right now.

12:09.162 --> 12:11.896
        (ominous music)

12:25.312 --> 12:28.146
        (floor creaking)

12:30.584 --> 12:33.384
        (items thumping)

12:41.862 --> 12:44.763
       (toilet flushing)

12:49.936 --> 12:51.169
         What the hell!

12:52.672 --> 12:53.872
          Do you see?

12:53.874 --> 12:55.140
  Do you see what's going on?

12:55.142 --> 12:56.641
      Do you see the shit
      I have to deal with?

12:58.478 --> 13:01.246
        (ominous music)

13:06.787 --> 13:11.856
        (ghostly winds)
       (thunder cracking)

13:16.029 --> 13:16.928
             Hello?

13:34.581 --> 13:37.482
       (Rebecca screams)

14:14.721 --> 14:15.620
           Hey guys.

14:17.157 --> 14:18.890
          It's day two

14:19.793 --> 14:24.863
  and right now it's 8:55 am.

14:25.532 --> 14:26.764
      Almost nine o'clock.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.869
  I was able to get some sleep

14:30.871 --> 14:33.037
       since last night,

14:33.039 --> 14:36.107
  but I still had nightmares.

14:53.226 --> 14:56.194
       (Rebecca vomiting)

15:18.084 --> 15:20.985
       (toilet flushing)

15:38.405 --> 15:39.904
     Sorry about that guys.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.674
       I don't know what
       just came over me.

15:44.844 --> 15:47.745
     Also, I just looked at
      myself in the mirror

15:47.747 --> 15:52.717
        and my veins are
     coming out of my neck.

15:54.688 --> 15:57.722
    I don't know if it's an
 allergic reaction to something

15:57.724 --> 16:00.325
      or if it's the start
       of my possession.

16:03.430 --> 16:04.662
         I don't know.

16:04.664 --> 16:06.264
       I guess we'll have
        to wait and see.

16:08.535 --> 16:11.269
        (phone ringing)

16:13.239 --> 16:14.372
             Hello?

16:14.374 --> 16:17.542
  (phone buzzing and clanking)

16:17.544 --> 16:18.443
             Hello?

16:23.850 --> 16:26.584
        (phone ringing)

16:29.923 --> 16:30.788
             Hello?

16:32.258 --> 16:34.892
        (phone laughing)

16:34.894 --> 16:35.793
             Hello?

16:37.063 --> 16:38.563
      Get a life asshole!

16:40.100 --> 16:40.999
              God.

16:44.671 --> 16:47.405
        (phone ringing)

16:54.514 --> 16:56.714
     Who the hell is this?

16:56.716 --> 16:59.550
        (male screaming)

17:02.322 --> 17:05.390
       - [Male On Phone]
       Please forgive us!

17:11.931 --> 17:14.665
        (ghostly winds)

17:29.649 --> 17:32.617
       (Rebecca sneezing)

17:40.226 --> 17:41.125
           - Oh shit.

17:42.028 --> 17:43.428
        I gotta go guys.

17:52.205 --> 17:54.572
      Hey guys, I'm back.

17:58.912 --> 18:00.711
       This is all really
     starting to get to me

18:00.713 --> 18:02.547
       and I'm so scared.

18:05.452 --> 18:06.884
  I called my boyfriend Dante

18:06.886 --> 18:09.520
        and he's on his
      way over right now.

18:10.957 --> 18:13.491
        I can't be here
      another night alone.

18:15.328 --> 18:17.295
       (Rebecca sobbing)

18:17.297 --> 18:19.363
        (phone ringing)

18:19.365 --> 18:20.398
       That must be him.

18:22.469 --> 18:23.501
           Hey babe.

18:23.503 --> 18:26.938
        (phone buzzing)

18:26.940 --> 18:28.606
             Babe?

18:28.608 --> 18:30.775
   - [Male On Phone] Help me.

18:33.446 --> 18:36.180
        (phone ringing)

18:38.952 --> 18:39.851
            - Babe.

18:42.555 --> 18:47.625
       - [Male On Phone]
       Rebecca, help me!

18:49.696 --> 18:51.596
     - Dante, is that you?

18:53.199 --> 18:54.665
  Please stop playing with me.

18:58.438 --> 18:59.737
   Whoever the fuck this is,

18:59.739 --> 19:01.639
        stop calling me!

19:03.743 --> 19:06.477
        (phone ringing)

19:08.281 --> 19:10.781
 I'm not picking up this time.

19:18.057 --> 19:20.925
       (Rebecca sobbing)

19:22.061 --> 19:24.662
       Hey, it's Rebecca,
        leave a message.

19:24.664 --> 19:27.365
        (phone beeping)

19:29.068 --> 19:31.869

19:41.347 --> 19:43.114

19:46.519 --> 19:49.420

19:55.061 --> 19:57.795
        (phone beeping)

20:04.337 --> 20:07.672

20:10.743 --> 20:11.642
           Oh my God.

It just now got so cold in here.

20:34.634 --> 20:36.968
    Did you guys hear that?

20:36.970 --> 20:38.936
    It's so fucking creepy.

20:42.875 --> 20:45.710

20:49.816 --> 20:52.717

21:09.469 --> 21:11.068

       Hey, it's Rebecca,
        leave a message.

21:54.480 --> 21:55.713
        (phone beeping)

21:55.715 --> 21:57.648
   - Hey babe, are you there?
            - Dante?

22:00.086 --> 22:01.218
     - [Rebecca] Hey babe.

22:01.220 --> 22:02.053
      - [Dante] I'm here.

22:02.055 --> 22:03.120
       - Oh you're here.

22:03.122 --> 22:03.954
  - [Dante] Outside the door.

22:03.956 --> 22:04.889
            - Okay.

22:04.891 --> 22:05.690
  - [Dante] You okay sweetie?

22:05.692 --> 22:06.891
            - Yeah.

22:06.893 --> 22:08.326
      The doors unlocked,
        just come on up.

22:08.328 --> 22:09.327
        - [Dante] Okay,
       I'll be right up.

22:09.329 --> 22:11.228
        - Okay, I'll see
        you in a second.

22:11.230 --> 22:12.163
              Bye.

22:12.165 --> 22:13.397
         - [Dante] Bye.

22:14.767 --> 22:15.866
       - That was Dante.

22:17.603 --> 22:19.670
      I can't let him know
      what just happened.

22:21.007 --> 22:23.374
 I mean he already knows about
   the veins on my neck, but

22:24.977 --> 22:26.510
 I have to see if I look okay.

22:31.984 --> 22:34.719
        (water running)

22:40.393 --> 22:41.325
           - Rebecca!

22:44.130 --> 22:45.363
            Rebecca!

22:45.365 --> 22:46.831
     - [Rebecca] Hey babe.

22:46.833 --> 22:47.865
             - Hey.

22:50.803 --> 22:52.436
      You know what babe,
    you shouldn't leave the

22:52.438 --> 22:53.971
         door open when
       you're home alone.

22:53.973 --> 22:55.806
         It's not safe.

22:55.808 --> 22:57.508
   - Oh babe, I'm a big girl.

22:57.510 --> 22:59.310
       I think I can take
        care of myself.

22:59.312 --> 23:00.945
        - Is that right?

23:00.947 --> 23:03.280
   - [Rebecca] That's right.

23:03.282 --> 23:04.849
            - Damn.

23:04.851 --> 23:06.817
       You weren't lying
      about the veins huh?

23:08.287 --> 23:09.253
       - Is it that bad?

23:09.255 --> 23:10.488
          - Hell yeah.

23:10.490 --> 23:11.422
      You gonna go to the
       doctors tomorrow?

23:11.424 --> 23:13.257
  You gotta go check them out.

23:13.259 --> 23:16.560
   - Well, I think I'm gonna
  wait a few days before I go.

23:16.562 --> 23:17.495
   - I don't know about that.

23:17.497 --> 23:19.864
I wouldn't do that if I was you.

23:19.866 --> 23:21.399
            - Babe.

23:21.401 --> 23:24.101
    I'll be fine, thank you.

23:24.103 --> 23:25.269
        - If you say so.

23:27.974 --> 23:30.908
       (computer beeping)

23:33.546 --> 23:34.578
      What are you doing?

23:35.715 --> 23:38.616
      - Nothing, I'm just
      doing a video diary.

23:38.618 --> 23:40.151
           - For who?

23:40.153 --> 23:41.519
     - For whoever watches.

23:42.889 --> 23:44.321
  - Like online or something?

23:45.391 --> 23:46.290
            - Maybe.

23:47.126 --> 23:47.958
             Yeah.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.226
        - Is that right?

23:49.228 --> 23:50.961
        - That's right.

23:50.963 --> 23:53.030
      Why are you looking
      at me like that for?

23:54.133 --> 23:55.366
             Babe.

23:55.368 --> 23:57.401
        Hey, I said this
       is a video diary,

23:57.403 --> 23:58.502
          not a porno.

23:59.639 --> 24:01.005
             Okay?

24:01.007 --> 24:02.540
          - Whatever.

24:02.542 --> 24:04.074
 I'm gonna go use the bathroom

24:04.076 --> 24:06.510
  and then I'll come back and
  lay for a little bit, okay?

24:06.512 --> 24:08.979
- Lay in bed, you just got here.

24:08.981 --> 24:10.214
    - Yeah I just got here.

24:10.216 --> 24:11.916
     Got here straight from
      work and I'm tired.

24:11.918 --> 24:13.851
   It's been a long day baby.

24:13.853 --> 24:14.752
            - Okay.

24:15.922 --> 24:17.688
        - Oh, and I got
       something for you.

24:18.758 --> 24:20.491
    - You got me something?

24:20.493 --> 24:21.892
       - Well my mom did.

24:21.894 --> 24:23.928
 I told her about the bullshit
     you were going through

24:23.930 --> 24:26.430
       and she said this
       will protect you.

24:26.432 --> 24:28.432
      - You told your mom?

24:28.434 --> 24:30.968
   - Yes, she believes you're
    going through something.

24:33.639 --> 24:34.705
      - Do you believe me?

24:36.409 --> 24:37.308
             - Hey,

24:38.811 --> 24:40.744
 just be happy I told her okay?

25:07.306 --> 25:08.606
           Hey guys.

25:08.608 --> 25:10.574
       It's day three now

25:10.576 --> 25:14.778
   and right now it's 8:33 am

25:14.780 --> 25:16.247
      and I just woke up.

25:20.286 --> 25:23.020
        (Dante yawning)

25:25.758 --> 25:27.057
   Babe, what are you doing?

25:28.261 --> 25:30.060
       - [Rebecca] Sorry
     babe, did I wake you?

25:30.062 --> 25:32.329
    - [Dante] It's cool, but
   what are you doing though?

25:32.331 --> 25:34.098
- I'm just ding my video diary.

25:35.568 --> 25:36.967
   - [Dante] Are you serious?

25:37.937 --> 25:39.236
            - What?

25:39.238 --> 25:41.572
   - [Dante] It's too early.

25:41.574 --> 25:43.874
 - Babe, it's part of my diary,

25:43.876 --> 25:45.276
        I have to do it.

25:45.278 --> 25:46.310
      - [Dante] Whatever.

25:53.786 --> 25:55.753
- [Rebecca] What are you doing?

25:55.755 --> 25:57.354
      - I'm gonna go home.

25:57.356 --> 25:59.390
       I gotta go back to
      work in a few hours.

25:59.392 --> 26:00.925
       - Please don't go.

26:01.827 --> 26:03.360
          - I have to.

26:03.362 --> 26:04.261
       - But I'm scared.

26:04.263 --> 26:06.063
       - Scared of what?

26:09.302 --> 26:11.101
         - Never mind.

26:11.103 --> 26:13.437
       - Look, call me if
   there's an emergency okay?

26:22.782 --> 26:26.050
      Oh, and chill out on
    the YouTube videos okay?

26:26.052 --> 26:27.685
    - They're video diaries.

26:34.193 --> 26:35.092
         Love you too!

26:37.296 --> 26:38.195
             Jerk.

26:40.600 --> 26:41.932
   Alright guys, I gotta go.

26:48.307 --> 26:51.108
        (monitor static)

27:04.423 --> 27:05.990
       I can see you all.

27:06.926 --> 27:08.826
     You pitiful creatures.

27:09.929 --> 27:12.930
        I can feel your
      fears, it feeds me.

27:13.866 --> 27:15.432
       I want your souls.

27:16.702 --> 27:18.602
     I will not be stopped.

27:19.739 --> 27:23.340
        I will fool you,
        I will trap you,

27:23.342 --> 27:25.476
       and you will fall
      right onto my feet.

27:27.847 --> 27:30.848
       (Rebecca laughing)

27:39.825 --> 27:44.895
       (loud scratching)
        (ominous music)

27:51.003 --> 27:53.837
        (nails cracking)

28:00.346 --> 28:01.245
           Oh my God.

28:03.049 --> 28:04.581
 What did I just do to myself!

28:06.852 --> 28:11.889
            Oh God.
       (Rebecca sobbing)

28:20.599 --> 28:21.565
           Hey guys.

28:22.535 --> 28:24.768
   So you've seen the things

28:25.938 --> 28:27.905
       that are happening
       to me in my room.

28:30.509 --> 28:32.342
   It's all very disturbing.

28:33.579 --> 28:34.578
          You saw it.

28:37.450 --> 28:40.417
       (computer beeping)

28:42.688 --> 28:44.455
  Are you fucking kidding me?

28:45.591 --> 28:47.391
       None of this stuff
    that is happening to me

28:47.393 --> 28:49.660
 is staged or fake, none of it!

28:49.662 --> 28:51.862
     It's all fucking real!

28:55.000 --> 28:56.366
       You know what, if
      you don't believe me

28:56.368 --> 28:58.602
      then stop watching!

29:01.474 --> 29:04.374
       (Rebecca sobbing)

29:09.782 --> 29:12.916
        I'm just at loss
      for words right now.

29:15.421 --> 29:17.488
      But, you know what,

29:17.490 --> 29:19.356
the proof is there on the video.

29:19.358 --> 29:21.091
 Whether you believe me or not,

29:21.093 --> 29:22.960
      I'm not going crazy.

29:22.962 --> 29:23.827
            I'm not.

29:26.031 --> 29:29.700
       Something evil did
        something to me.

29:30.736 --> 29:32.102
       It also did this.

29:35.007 --> 29:36.440
           It hurts.

29:45.217 --> 29:46.150
           I'm sorry.

29:47.253 --> 29:48.252
            I just,

29:49.421 --> 29:51.722
       I just wanna prove
         to people that

29:53.759 --> 29:57.494
what's happening to me is real.

29:57.496 --> 29:59.229
       But you know what,

30:01.267 --> 30:02.666
         I don't care.

30:02.668 --> 30:04.601
I don't care if you believe me.

30:04.603 --> 30:08.105
    I'm gonna be continuing
      with my video diary.

30:08.107 --> 30:12.442
 And in the end, it will prove

30:12.444 --> 30:14.178
        that I'm right.

30:15.247 --> 30:17.981
        (phone ringing)

30:19.251 --> 30:21.919
      Huh, that's strange.

30:21.921 --> 30:24.421
    My phone's not supposed
    to accept blocked calls.

30:26.025 --> 30:27.591
        (phone beeping)

30:27.593 --> 30:30.694
       Hey, it's Rebecca,
        leave a message.

30:30.696 --> 30:33.397

       (woman screaming)

30:39.071 --> 30:43.774
       (Rebecca slapped)
       (Rebecca screams)

30:45.945 --> 30:48.946
- [Male On Phone] Hello Rebecca.

30:48.948 --> 30:50.347
        - What the fuck?

30:53.853 --> 30:54.785
          Who is that?

30:55.855 --> 30:57.888
  - [Male On Phone] The Devil.

30:57.890 --> 30:59.957
    You have called upon me.

31:01.760 --> 31:03.327
       And now I am here!

31:05.998 --> 31:07.364
          - No please.

31:07.366 --> 31:09.266
   I didn't mean to, please.

31:09.268 --> 31:11.235
   - [Devil] It is too late.

31:11.237 --> 31:14.438
 Soon I will possess your soul!

31:16.442 --> 31:18.308
  - What do you want from me!

31:18.310 --> 31:19.977
      - [Devil] Your soul!

31:21.080 --> 31:23.680
      - Is there anything
     I can do to fix this?

31:23.682 --> 31:24.815
         - [Devil] No.

31:26.619 --> 31:28.852
     - Just go back to hell
      where you came from!

31:28.854 --> 31:30.354
            Just go!

31:30.356 --> 31:32.756
- [Devil] It's not that simple.

31:32.758 --> 31:34.591
     You have awakened me.

31:36.262 --> 31:38.528
- Fine then you fucking bastard!

31:39.598 --> 31:41.531
     I'm prepared to fight
       you until the end!

31:42.601 --> 31:44.134
      - [Devil] So be it.

31:44.136 --> 31:46.970
        (Devil laughing)

31:51.310 --> 31:52.643
        - [Rebecca] No.

32:04.623 --> 32:06.290
        (phone beeping)

32:06.292 --> 32:09.760
- [Phone] You have no messages.

32:09.762 --> 32:12.562
        (Rebecca grunts)

32:16.869 --> 32:19.803
     - Is there anyone out
    there that can help me?

32:19.805 --> 32:22.606
        (computer beeps)

32:24.677 --> 32:25.575
            My God.

32:26.779 --> 32:28.745
Some of you guys do believe me.

32:30.115 --> 32:32.649
    Thank you, thank you so
   much for your kind words.

32:32.651 --> 32:35.552
        (computer beeps)

32:35.554 --> 32:38.288
        You're right, I
       will consider it.

32:38.290 --> 32:40.123
       Thank you Carmen,
       you give me hope.

32:59.645 --> 33:00.978
   - [Woman On Phone] Hello?

33:00.980 --> 33:04.247
- Hey Aunt Peggy, it's Rebecca.

33:04.249 --> 33:05.983
        - Oh hi Rebecca.

33:05.985 --> 33:07.117
       Long time no hear.

33:07.119 --> 33:08.251
     What's up sweetheart?

33:09.154 --> 33:10.287
        - Nothing much.

33:12.191 --> 33:13.390
Haven't talked to you in a while

33:13.392 --> 33:15.826
        so I just wanted
      to call and say hi.

33:16.895 --> 33:19.696
    - Well it's really great
      hearing your voice.

33:19.698 --> 33:20.897
        - Yeah, you too.

33:22.668 --> 33:26.303
         Listen, I was
     wondering if you could

33:26.305 --> 33:29.706
   possibly send your psychic
    friend over to my house.

33:29.708 --> 33:33.043
 - Well sure, but I thought you
  didn't believe in psychics?

33:34.680 --> 33:36.113
       - I'm just curious
        about something

33:36.115 --> 33:38.849
       and I would really
        love her advice.

33:38.851 --> 33:40.083
         - Okay, sure.

33:40.085 --> 33:41.051
      I'll give her a call
       and see if she can

33:41.053 --> 33:42.753
    come over to your house.

33:42.755 --> 33:44.354
     - Okay, that's great.

33:44.356 --> 33:45.355
           Thank you.

33:45.357 --> 33:47.924
 - When do you want to see her?

33:47.926 --> 33:49.059
             - Oh.

33:49.061 --> 33:52.162
     Well today or tomorrow
         at the latest.

33:52.164 --> 33:53.063
        - Why so urgent?

33:54.166 --> 33:55.899
       - Aunt Peggy, it's
        kind of personal

33:55.901 --> 33:58.168
  and I really don't have time
    to explain it right now.

33:58.170 --> 34:00.404
     But if you could give
      her my phone number

34:00.406 --> 34:03.040
      and address and send
      her over right away.

34:03.042 --> 34:05.208
       You still have my
       information right?

34:05.210 --> 34:06.576
       - Yeah of course.

34:06.578 --> 34:08.078
         - Okay great.

34:08.080 --> 34:12.416
    Listen, I have to go but
   thank you and I love you.

34:12.418 --> 34:13.817
        - Love you too.

34:13.819 --> 34:15.185
              Bye.

34:15.187 --> 34:16.053
             - Bye.

34:20.324 --> 34:22.192
  Alright guys, I have to go,

34:22.194 --> 34:23.893
        but I'll be back
        in a little bit.

34:31.036 --> 34:33.603
         (eerie music)

34:50.322 --> 34:51.321
          - Oh my God.

34:53.192 --> 34:54.925
      - What, what is it?

34:54.927 --> 34:56.860
  - Why did you bring me here?

34:58.163 --> 35:00.063
     - Well, that's what I
  wanted to talk to you about.

35:00.065 --> 35:01.798
  I'm really scared right now

35:01.800 --> 35:03.266
  and I don't know what to do.

35:04.636 --> 35:05.569
        - I believe you.

35:06.605 --> 35:07.471
           - You do?

35:07.473 --> 35:08.672
             - Yes.

35:08.674 --> 35:09.606
        - But I haven't
      even told you what--

35:09.608 --> 35:11.308
  - You don't have to tell me.

35:11.310 --> 35:14.077
       This thing, this,

35:14.079 --> 35:16.279
this evil presence in your house

35:16.281 --> 35:18.782
  and especially in this room.

35:24.857 --> 35:27.491
      It's trying to take
     control of something.

35:27.493 --> 35:28.792
             - Yes.

35:28.794 --> 35:30.093
   Yes, that something is me.

35:30.095 --> 35:32.762
       It's the devil and
       he wants my soul!

35:32.764 --> 35:33.997
         - Yes, I know!

35:35.000 --> 35:36.867
   (psychic breathes heavily)

35:36.869 --> 35:37.701
        - Are you okay?

35:37.703 --> 35:38.602
         Are you okay?

35:39.371 --> 35:40.270
         - I'm alright.

35:43.475 --> 35:45.075
          I'm alright.

35:45.077 --> 35:48.645
      It's just, being in
    here is so overwhelming.

35:54.153 --> 35:55.569
     - I can't believe it.

35:55.570 --> 35:56.986
     You're the only person
  right now that believes me.

35:56.989 --> 35:58.622
  - The devil is very strong.

35:59.958 --> 36:01.358
           - I know.

36:01.360 --> 36:05.629
    And I'm so scared and I
     don't know what to do.

36:05.631 --> 36:06.997
   - There's only one option.

36:08.901 --> 36:10.767
     - What do you suggest?

36:10.769 --> 36:12.469
       - I have a friend
        who's a priest--

36:12.471 --> 36:13.537
          - Forget it.

36:13.539 --> 36:14.871
             - Why?

36:14.873 --> 36:16.139
           - Because,

36:16.141 --> 36:18.742
 priests, nuns, psychologists,

36:18.744 --> 36:22.379
   I've been to them all and
    none of them believe me.

36:22.381 --> 36:23.847
- You have to leave this house.

36:23.849 --> 36:26.216
       Go stay in a hotel
       somewhere tonight,

36:26.218 --> 36:27.617
      we'll come pick you
       up in the morning

36:27.619 --> 36:28.852
      and come back here.

36:28.854 --> 36:31.621
     And he'll tell us what
    he thinks we should do.

36:31.623 --> 36:33.023
           - I can't.

36:33.025 --> 36:33.857
           - Why not?

36:33.859 --> 36:35.091
      It's not safe here.

36:35.093 --> 36:36.927
      - Because it doesn't
       matter where I go!

36:36.929 --> 36:40.864
     It doesn't matter what
      I do, he follows me!

36:40.866 --> 36:42.999
        There's no point
       in trying to run!

36:45.938 --> 36:46.836
        - I understand.

36:49.441 --> 36:51.508
        Here, take this.

36:57.649 --> 36:58.548
         - What is it?

36:59.585 --> 37:00.951
      - It'll help protect
         you from harm

37:00.953 --> 37:02.419
  until I come back tomorrow.

37:04.856 --> 37:06.623
      - How does it work?

37:06.625 --> 37:08.558
 - Just sprinkle it on the bed

37:08.560 --> 37:11.127
       and the areas that
       you are the most.

37:12.331 --> 37:14.598
     It won't stop the evil
       from attacking you

37:14.600 --> 37:16.433
 but it'll make it not as bad.

37:19.871 --> 37:21.538
    I'll come back tomorrow.

37:21.540 --> 37:23.974
     Please call me if you
      need anything else.

37:26.545 --> 37:27.611
          - Thank you.

37:28.981 --> 37:32.048
  It feels so good to finally
    have someone believe me.

37:46.265 --> 37:49.099
        (faint cracking)

37:50.769 --> 37:53.503
        (ominous music)

38:26.905 --> 38:29.939
      (suspenseful music)

38:38.216 --> 38:41.117
       (Rebecca gasping)

38:59.938 --> 39:02.572
         (low growling)

39:05.977 --> 39:06.810
       - [Dante] Rebecca!

39:06.812 --> 39:07.744
           - In here.

39:07.746 --> 39:09.946
 - Babe, what's wrong with you?

39:09.948 --> 39:11.614
           - Help me.

39:11.616 --> 39:12.515
           Oh my God.

39:17.389 --> 39:18.355
        - [Dante] What's
      wrong with you babe?

39:18.357 --> 39:20.790
 - Babe, you won't believe me.

39:20.792 --> 39:22.392
     - Babe, what happened
         to your neck?

39:22.394 --> 39:23.960
       - I didn't do it.

39:23.962 --> 39:25.261
            - What?

39:25.263 --> 39:26.463
    - You won't believe me.

39:27.666 --> 39:30.033
     - Shh, calm down baby.

39:30.035 --> 39:31.101
        Calm down okay?

39:31.103 --> 39:33.136
  Come on, let's just go lay.

39:34.139 --> 39:35.372
            - Babe.

39:35.374 --> 39:37.774
      Babe, so much weird
    stuff has been happening

39:37.776 --> 39:40.210
    and no one believes me.

39:40.212 --> 39:41.711
     - [Dante] Just relax.

39:41.713 --> 39:43.913
      Calm down baby okay?

39:43.915 --> 39:45.915
    We're gonna lay together
    for a few minutes, okay.

39:45.917 --> 39:47.617
 - [Rebecca] I can't, I can't!

39:47.619 --> 39:49.552
            - Relax.
   - I can't do this anymore.

39:49.554 --> 39:51.988
      - [Dante] Calm down
      baby, come on, shh.

39:51.990 --> 39:54.557
 - [Rebecca] No please, please.

39:54.559 --> 39:56.659
     - Come on, we'll just
      lay with each other.

39:56.661 --> 39:57.861
    Just for a few seconds.

39:57.863 --> 39:59.529
      And if you want, we
    can talk about it okay.

39:59.531 --> 40:02.432
But just relax baby, it's okay.

40:04.536 --> 40:08.571
              Shh.
        (Rebecca crying)

40:08.573 --> 40:09.739
        Calm down baby.

40:09.741 --> 40:11.174
         I'm here baby.

40:11.176 --> 40:13.143
         I'm here okay.

40:13.145 --> 40:14.043
              Shh.

40:16.081 --> 40:16.980
              Shh.

40:27.993 --> 40:32.962
        (ominous music)
        (loud thumping)

40:49.347 --> 40:51.981
         (bed creaking)

41:07.532 --> 41:09.732
   Babe, what are you doing?

41:09.734 --> 41:10.967
             Babe.

41:10.969 --> 41:12.936
       And why you got a
      knife in your hand?

41:17.375 --> 41:18.525
            Rebecca!

41:18.526 --> 41:19.676
       Come on baby, just
      give me that knife.

41:21.146 --> 41:23.046
      Give me that knife.

41:23.048 --> 41:24.814
       What the heck are
     you trying to do huh!

41:25.750 --> 41:26.616
     You trying to stab me?

41:26.618 --> 41:27.851
         What the fuck!

41:28.920 --> 41:30.353
     I'm leaving you bitch!

41:31.523 --> 41:33.256
       You actually tried
      to fucking stab me!

41:33.258 --> 41:34.924
         What the fuck!

41:34.926 --> 41:37.126
  You're actually gonna stand
  there and not say anything?

41:37.128 --> 41:38.294
       That's fucked up!

41:38.296 --> 41:40.497
     I'm going you fucking
        crazy ass bitch!

41:45.103 --> 41:47.604
          (door slams)

41:55.313 --> 41:58.114
        (light clanking)

42:17.936 --> 42:20.503
         (eerie music)

43:01.846 --> 43:06.916
       (Rebecca gasping)
        (ominous music)

43:15.026 --> 43:15.925
             - No!

43:16.795 --> 43:17.694
              No!

43:19.097 --> 43:20.063
          Get off me!

43:20.966 --> 43:21.931
          Get off me!

43:23.868 --> 43:24.767
            Please!

43:29.007 --> 43:31.441
        (Devil growling)

43:31.443 --> 43:32.342
            Please.

43:33.745 --> 43:34.744
          Get off me!

43:38.750 --> 43:41.417
       (Rebecca screams)

43:41.419 --> 43:44.220
        (Devil growling)

44:08.213 --> 44:09.178
             Dante?

44:10.982 --> 44:12.882
   Dante are you still here?

44:32.370 --> 44:33.703
           Hey babe--

44:33.705 --> 44:35.138
  - You have the fucking nerve
        - Where'd you--

44:35.140 --> 44:36.973
     - To fucking call me!
    - Whoa, whoa, slow down.

44:36.975 --> 44:37.907
      - [Rebecca] What are
       you talking about?

44:37.909 --> 44:39.342
- [Dante] You tried to stab me!

44:39.344 --> 44:40.343
      Don't you remember!

44:40.345 --> 44:41.511
            - What?

44:41.513 --> 44:42.745
    - You tried to stab me!
       - No, no, I didn't

44:42.747 --> 44:43.746
      - [Rebecca] Try and
     stab you with a knife.

44:43.748 --> 44:44.914
     - [Dante] Yes you did!

44:46.017 --> 44:47.283
     I don't know what the
    - Babe, are you sure you

44:47.285 --> 44:48.217
    - Fuck your problem is!
    - Weren't just dreaming

44:48.219 --> 44:49.218
   - [Rebecca] Or something?

44:49.220 --> 44:50.753
        - [Dante] No I'm
        not daydreaming!

44:50.755 --> 44:51.654
   You tried to stab me, bye!
   - Babe, I'm being serious!

44:51.656 --> 44:52.622
       - [Rebecca] Hello?

45:07.739 --> 45:08.638
           Oh my God.

45:10.375 --> 45:11.240
           Oh my God!

45:14.979 --> 45:16.546
 Oh my poor baby, he was right.

45:18.416 --> 45:19.315
           Oh my God!

45:22.220 --> 45:27.290
           Oh my God.
       (Rebecca sobbing)

45:40.672 --> 45:43.139
    Hey guys, it's day five

45:43.141 --> 45:47.009
  and right now it's 1:13 pm.

45:54.252 --> 45:56.719
       My boyfriend Dante
        broke up with me

45:56.721 --> 46:00.022
  because I tried stabbing him
   with a knife this morning.

46:01.159 --> 46:02.725
       But it wasn't me,
       it was the Devil.

46:02.727 --> 46:04.994
        I would never do
      anything like that.

46:07.632 --> 46:08.998
   But I have to stay strong,

46:09.000 --> 46:10.500
  I can't let this get to me.

46:10.502 --> 46:13.402
       I have to continue
         these diaries.

46:15.874 --> 46:19.375
     So other than feeling
      severely depressed,

46:20.211 --> 46:21.511
         I feel weird.

46:22.947 --> 46:27.016
 I feel like I'm losing myself
    more and more each day.

46:33.591 --> 46:35.124
        So on that note,

46:37.595 --> 46:41.998
   I'm going to be writing a
   letter to my roommate Esmy

46:42.000 --> 46:45.434
    or anyone that finds it.

46:45.436 --> 46:47.737
 So whoever finds this letter,

46:47.739 --> 46:49.172
      including you Esmy,

46:50.675 --> 46:53.509
       it means I didn't
    survive the possession.

46:53.511 --> 46:56.813
        (phone ringing)

46:56.815 --> 46:58.548
          It's Dante.

46:58.550 --> 46:59.382
     We broke up remember.

46:59.384 --> 47:00.316
      I'm not picking up.

47:11.896 --> 47:14.697
       Hey, it's Rebecca,
        leave a message.

47:14.699 --> 47:16.766
        (phone beeping)

47:16.768 --> 47:18.835
  - [Dante] Rebecca, pick up!

47:18.837 --> 47:20.336
       Pick up Rebecca, I
       know you're there!

47:20.338 --> 47:22.672
   Listen you fucking bitch,
  I will gut you like a fish!

47:22.674 --> 47:24.140
       You understand me!

47:24.142 --> 47:26.108
   I will take the knife you
     tried to stab me with,

47:26.110 --> 47:27.643
       slice it down the
     middle of your stomach

47:27.645 --> 47:28.845
    and rip out your insides

47:28.847 --> 47:30.379
       and hang you from
     your own fucking guts

47:30.381 --> 47:31.881
       you fucking whore!

47:31.883 --> 47:35.518
   (Dante and Devil laughing)

47:36.955 --> 47:39.689
        (phone beeping)

47:57.609 --> 47:58.541
             Yeah?

47:58.543 --> 48:00.076
  - How dare you threaten me?

48:01.312 --> 48:03.079
       - [Dante] What are
       you talking about?

48:03.081 --> 48:05.147
      - You know, it's one
   thing to break up with me,

48:05.149 --> 48:06.716
 but then to threaten my life?

48:06.718 --> 48:08.017
         How dare you!

48:08.019 --> 48:09.619
       - [Dante] What are
       you talking about?

48:09.621 --> 48:10.853
    I never threatened you.

48:10.855 --> 48:12.154
        You're tripping.

48:12.156 --> 48:14.190
 - I got your message asshole!

48:14.192 --> 48:15.258
        Listen to this.

48:16.160 --> 48:17.760
        (phone beeping)

48:17.762 --> 48:19.562
  - [Female] Rebecca, pick up!

48:19.564 --> 48:21.297
       Pick up Rebecca, I
       know you're there!

48:21.299 --> 48:22.965
   Listen you fucking bitch!

48:22.967 --> 48:24.500
      I will gut you like
       the fish you are!

48:24.502 --> 48:26.002
       You understand me!

48:26.004 --> 48:27.703
     I will take that knife
   you tried to stab me with

48:27.705 --> 48:29.338
     and slice you down the
     middle of your stomach

48:29.340 --> 48:31.173
      and rip your insides
      until they hang out

48:31.175 --> 48:32.141
   with your own fucking guts

48:32.143 --> 48:33.709
       you fucking whore!

48:33.711 --> 48:37.013
   (woman on phone laughing)

48:37.015 --> 48:39.749
        (phone beeping)

48:52.096 --> 48:54.830
        (phone ringing)

48:57.035 --> 48:59.769
        (ominous music)

49:10.248 --> 49:11.747
    - [Rebecca's Voicemail]
       Hey, it's Rebecca,

49:11.749 --> 49:13.149
        leave a message.

49:14.218 --> 49:16.886
        (phone beeping)

49:16.888 --> 49:19.755
       (faint screaming)

49:23.227 --> 49:28.264
        (loud slapping)
       (Rebecca screams)

49:29.100 --> 49:30.800
 - [Devil] Hello again Rebecca.

49:30.802 --> 49:32.201
     - Just leave me alone!

49:32.203 --> 49:35.905
      - [Devil] Not until
       I have your soul.

49:35.907 --> 49:36.806
      - You can't have it.

49:36.808 --> 49:38.274
    I won't give it to you!

49:38.276 --> 49:40.242
    - [Devil] Yes you will.

49:40.244 --> 49:41.210
          Eventually.

49:42.447 --> 49:44.180
  - I don't fucking think so!

49:44.182 --> 49:49.185
  - [Devil] Your soul is mine!

49:49.187 --> 49:50.653
     - [Rebecca] Fine then
      you fucking bastard,

49:50.655 --> 49:51.721
        come and get it!

49:52.657 --> 49:54.557
     - [Devil] My pleasure.

50:26.224 --> 50:28.924
        (ominous music)

50:47.879 --> 50:50.679
        (chair scraping)

51:08.800 --> 51:10.466
        (door knocking)

51:10.468 --> 51:13.669
           - Rebecca?

51:13.671 --> 51:18.741
      Rebecca we're here.

51:22.647 --> 51:23.546
            Rebecca?

51:28.386 --> 51:29.251
            Rebecca?

51:33.424 --> 51:34.323
            Rebecca.

51:36.894 --> 51:39.061
 Father what's wrong with her?

51:43.067 --> 51:43.966
           - Rebecca.

51:47.171 --> 51:50.906
            Rebecca.

51:50.908 --> 51:53.676
            Rebecca.

51:53.678 --> 51:58.747
  - Rebecca's no longer here.

51:59.283 --> 52:04.220
        - Where is she?

52:04.755 --> 52:05.488
         Where is she?

52:11.963 --> 52:13.362
         Where is she?

52:13.364 --> 52:16.098
        (psychic gasps)

52:21.172 --> 52:22.571
       You need to leave.

52:22.573 --> 52:23.639
    - What are you gonna do?

52:23.641 --> 52:25.374
      - You need to leave.

52:31.282 --> 52:33.516
       (psychic knocking)

52:33.518 --> 52:38.587
   - [Psychic] Father Brien?

53:13.624 --> 53:16.358
        (ominous music)

53:23.100 --> 53:25.034
        (Devil growling)

53:25.036 --> 53:27.002
      - In the name of the
     Father and of the Son

53:27.004 --> 53:28.237
    and of the Holy Spirit.

53:30.541 --> 53:32.107
      Hallow be thy name.

53:32.109 --> 53:33.709
       Thy kingdom come,

53:33.711 --> 53:36.345
      thy will be done on
   earth as it is in heaven!

53:36.347 --> 53:37.913
Give us this day our daily bread

53:37.915 --> 53:39.915
 and forgive us our trespasses.

53:39.917 --> 53:42.484
    As we forgive those who
      trespass against us.

53:43.487 --> 53:45.387
     And lead us from evil.

53:46.424 --> 53:49.158
  Our Father who art in heaven

53:49.160 --> 53:50.459
     hallowed be thy name.

53:50.461 --> 53:52.861
        Thy kingdom come
       they will be done

53:52.863 --> 53:54.730
  on earth as it is in heaven!

53:54.732 --> 53:56.232
Give us this day our daily bread

53:56.234 --> 53:58.267
 and forgive us our trespasses.

53:58.269 --> 54:01.704
      As we forgive those
    who trespass against...

54:03.241 --> 54:05.908
         (low growling)

54:43.247 --> 54:48.317
        (ominous music)
        (Devil laughing)

55:04.535 --> 55:08.671
(Rebecca grunting and screaming)

55:13.411 --> 55:14.710
        I cast you out!

55:15.780 --> 55:17.012
  In the name of Jesus Christ

55:17.014 --> 55:19.515
     by the precious blood
      of the divine lamb!

55:19.517 --> 55:21.183
     There is only one God!

55:21.185 --> 55:23.419
      The God who created
       heaven and earth!

55:23.421 --> 55:26.755
    The God that sacrificed
     his only begotten Son!

55:26.757 --> 55:28.557
  The Son of God command you!

55:30.194 --> 55:32.027
  The Holy Ghost command you!

55:32.029 --> 55:35.531
       All the saints in
      heaven command you!

55:35.533 --> 55:36.465
      (Rebecca screaming)

55:36.467 --> 55:38.434
  Christ eternal commands you!

55:40.071 --> 55:44.006
   Our Lord, Jesus Christ the
  eternal Christ commands you!

55:48.679 --> 55:51.313
         (somber music)

56:02.893 --> 56:04.126
         - Who are you?

56:48.105 --> 56:49.004
           - Rebecca.

56:52.843 --> 56:54.176
    Father will she be okay?

57:24.742 --> 57:25.774
          - Hey guys.

57:26.977 --> 57:29.845
      It's still day five
        and Father Brien

57:29.847 --> 57:33.282
       and Esmeralda just
     left not too long ago.

57:35.486 --> 57:38.287
       So after they left
        I took a shower

57:38.289 --> 57:40.255
           and after,

57:41.225 --> 57:43.892
I looked at myself in the mirror

57:43.894 --> 57:48.297
   and noticed that the veins
     are still on my neck.

57:48.299 --> 57:50.132
       I was hoping that
       after the exorcism

57:50.134 --> 57:51.667
    that they would be gone.

57:51.669 --> 57:55.204
      But I'm hoping that
        it's just taking

57:55.206 --> 57:57.539
      a little bit longer
        than I expected.

57:59.877 --> 58:02.010
 Anyways, I finished my letter

58:02.012 --> 58:04.680
      and I'm going to be
     keeping it right here

58:04.682 --> 58:06.181
      next to my computer.

58:10.221 --> 58:11.954
   I'm gonna go lie down now.

58:11.956 --> 58:13.889
  I'm really not feeling well

58:13.891 --> 58:15.457
  and I have a huge headache.

58:16.594 --> 58:20.462
      Also, this is gonna
     be the end of my diary

58:20.464 --> 58:22.698
       because I survived
         my possession.

58:23.701 --> 58:26.635
But I'll come back and I'll talk

58:26.637 --> 58:28.136
  to you guys in a little bit.

58:28.138 --> 58:29.404
           Okay, bye.

58:38.215 --> 58:39.448
           Hey guys.

58:39.450 --> 58:44.152
     So, of course, again,
    I didn't get any sleep.

58:44.688 --> 58:45.420
           As usual.

58:46.891 --> 58:48.690
  But while I was lying in bed

58:48.692 --> 58:51.193
         I came to the
      stunning realization

58:51.195 --> 58:54.029
      that tomorrow is day
       six of the diary.

58:54.031 --> 58:57.065
        Which is also my
      birthday, Halloween.

58:59.336 --> 59:01.436
         And I was just
      lying there thinking

59:02.606 --> 59:06.174
  how incredibly thankful I am

59:06.176 --> 59:09.978
       to be able to live
   through another birthday.

59:14.752 --> 59:16.451
       But you know what?

59:16.453 --> 59:20.923
 I know now that I have nothing
    to worry about anymore.

59:20.925 --> 59:25.260
       The Devil is gone
     and I can feel things

59:25.262 --> 59:27.963
       slowly starting to
      get back to normal.

59:30.267 --> 59:32.267
        So on that note,

59:39.143 --> 59:41.109
    I won you motherfucker!

59:42.212 --> 59:44.680
  You will never get my soul!

59:45.516 --> 59:48.317
    Here is to you asshole!

59:53.223 --> 59:54.122
             Fuck!

59:56.193 --> 59:58.193
 Oh my God, this is impossible.

01:00:21.151 --> 01:00:22.017
          Hey Andrew.

01:00:23.554 --> 01:00:24.987
  Yeah, I'm good, how are you?

01:00:26.590 --> 01:00:29.191
        Listen, I need a
      huge favor from you.

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:44.239
- Hey what's going on with you?

01:00:44.241 --> 01:00:45.907
       I thought you was
     playing games with me.

01:00:45.909 --> 01:00:47.309
- If I told you what's going on

01:00:47.311 --> 01:00:48.844
    you wouldn't believe me.

01:00:48.846 --> 01:00:49.845
           - Try me.

01:00:49.847 --> 01:00:50.912
      I'm up for anything.

01:00:52.182 --> 01:00:53.782
      - It's a long story.

01:00:55.786 --> 01:00:57.052
             - Hey.

01:00:57.054 --> 01:00:57.886
  What's wrong with your face?

01:00:57.888 --> 01:00:58.787
         Are you okay?

01:00:59.890 --> 01:01:01.590
        - Yeah, I'm just
       not feeling good.

01:01:04.028 --> 01:01:07.863
     Listen, I need you to
    get rid of this for me.

01:01:09.466 --> 01:01:10.932
           - Awe man.

01:01:12.069 --> 01:01:13.969
       This is some evil
       shit you got here.

01:01:16.206 --> 01:01:17.305
     Did you play with it?

01:01:18.776 --> 01:01:20.008
             - Yes.

01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:21.243
       And it scared the
        shit out of me.

01:01:21.245 --> 01:01:23.512
       That's why I need
        you to burn it.

01:01:25.015 --> 01:01:26.481
  - Did you let something out?

01:01:28.118 --> 01:01:28.984
            - What?

01:01:29.853 --> 01:01:32.821
    No, no, not really, no.

01:01:32.823 --> 01:01:34.456
     - Oh come on, tell me!

01:01:34.458 --> 01:01:36.591
       I'm all into this
        paranormal shit!

01:01:39.496 --> 01:01:41.596
  - Do you really wanna know?

01:01:41.598 --> 01:01:42.497
            - Yeah!

01:01:48.038 --> 01:01:49.404
      - The Devil himself.

01:01:54.511 --> 01:01:55.410
        - You're lying.

01:01:57.981 --> 01:02:00.148
The Devil has no need for this.

01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:02.350
    Only demons and spirits
     channel through this.

01:02:02.352 --> 01:02:03.852
        - I told you you
      wouldn't believe me.

01:02:03.854 --> 01:02:04.953
       - No, no, no, no.

01:02:04.955 --> 01:02:06.154
         I believe you.

01:02:06.156 --> 01:02:07.122
        It's just that,

01:02:08.058 --> 01:02:10.125
   this is some serious shit!

01:02:10.127 --> 01:02:11.593
        - I know Andrew.

01:02:11.595 --> 01:02:14.196
     Listen, I need you to
   just get rid of it for me.

01:02:14.198 --> 01:02:15.697
      - Okay, alright, no
      problem, no problem.

01:02:15.699 --> 01:02:19.000
  Listen, I'm gonna burn this
 fucker to the ground alright?

01:02:19.002 --> 01:02:20.135
          - Thank you.

01:02:20.137 --> 01:02:21.403
     - [Andrew] No problem.

01:02:21.405 --> 01:02:22.604
       Hey, anything else
       you need from me,

01:02:22.606 --> 01:02:24.039
  I'm just a phone call away.

01:02:29.313 --> 01:02:31.980
        (phone ringing)

01:02:36.754 --> 01:02:37.652
            - Hello.

01:02:38.655 --> 01:02:40.122
    - [Aunt Peggy] Rebecca.
        (Peggy sobbing)

01:02:40.124 --> 01:02:41.556
  - Aunt Peggy, are you okay?

01:02:42.626 --> 01:02:45.393
     - It's about Esmeralda
       and Father Brien.

01:02:45.395 --> 01:02:46.928
     - What, what happened?

01:02:48.332 --> 01:02:51.933
  - I think they were involved
  in this horrific car crash.

01:02:54.171 --> 01:02:57.672
        I was talking to
     Esmeralda on the phone

01:02:57.674 --> 01:03:00.776
 and she was trying to tell me.

01:03:00.778 --> 01:03:02.210
       She was screaming.

01:03:02.212 --> 01:03:03.578
 But I couldn't quite make out

01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:05.313
      what she was saying.

01:03:05.315 --> 01:03:08.383
     - What are you talking
       about Aunt Peggy?

01:03:08.385 --> 01:03:10.318
        - I don't know.

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:12.587
She was talking something about

01:03:12.589 --> 01:03:16.057
    that she had to warn you
  about the Devil or something

01:03:16.059 --> 01:03:21.029
     and then, then I heard
     this really loud crash

01:03:22.332 --> 01:03:24.766
   in the background and then

01:03:24.768 --> 01:03:27.135
   the line went dead before

01:03:27.137 --> 01:03:28.837
   I knew what was happening.

01:03:29.807 --> 01:03:30.772
  - Find out if they're okay.

01:03:30.774 --> 01:03:32.607
      Please call me back!

01:03:32.609 --> 01:03:34.176
          - Of course.

01:03:35.245 --> 01:03:37.179
       I'll call you back
         in a bit okay.

01:03:38.215 --> 01:03:39.114
            - Okay.

01:03:56.200 --> 01:04:00.969
  So, I just got off the phone
    with my Aunt Peggy and,

01:04:06.743 --> 01:04:08.910
        and, oh my God.

01:04:10.981 --> 01:04:13.782
        Father Brien and
        Madame Esmeralda

01:04:17.921 --> 01:04:20.822
       died earlier today

01:04:23.527 --> 01:04:25.894
     due to their injuries
      from a car accident.

01:04:28.599 --> 01:04:30.265
 I feel like it's all my fault.

01:04:38.275 --> 01:04:41.009
        (phone ringing)

01:04:53.123 --> 01:04:56.691
       Hey, it's Rebecca,
        leave a message.

01:04:56.693 --> 01:04:58.660
        (phone beeping)

01:04:58.662 --> 01:05:01.463
        (loud screaming)

01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:17.512
      - [Devil] You didn't
    think it's over did you?

01:05:18.749 --> 01:05:21.383
  - Oh my God, you played me.

01:05:22.252 --> 01:05:24.219
    I thought you were gone.

01:05:24.221 --> 01:05:25.453
       - [Devil] I don't
       give up that easy.

01:05:27.257 --> 01:05:29.724
   It's called playing along.

01:05:29.726 --> 01:05:31.626
        (loud screaming)

01:05:31.628 --> 01:05:33.728
  It's going to take more than

01:05:33.730 --> 01:05:36.898
      a pathetic exorcism
       to get rid of me.

01:05:41.805 --> 01:05:43.705
     - Just leave me alone!

01:05:44.942 --> 01:05:47.042
   - [Devil] I won't do that

01:05:47.044 --> 01:05:49.110
    until I get what I want!

01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:53.014
       - You, you're the
     one that killed them.

01:05:53.016 --> 01:05:56.051
    You killed Father Brien
   and Esmeralda didn't you?

01:05:57.054 --> 01:05:58.420
         - [Devil] Yes.

01:05:58.422 --> 01:06:00.855
And I will kill anyone who tries

01:06:00.857 --> 01:06:03.158
  to interfere with my doing.

01:06:04.761 --> 01:06:05.660
             - No!

01:06:06.763 --> 01:06:08.763
       Leave them alone,
     leave everyone alone!

01:06:08.765 --> 01:06:11.032
     If you have a problem,
       just deal with me!

01:06:12.169 --> 01:06:16.037
     - [Devil] Their blood
     is on your hands now.

01:06:16.039 --> 01:06:19.341
     Rebecca, I suggest you
     let me have your soul

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:22.711
  before other lives are lost.

01:06:25.048 --> 01:06:27.382
  Do I need to show you more?

01:06:28.218 --> 01:06:29.117
           - No, no.

01:06:32.556 --> 01:06:35.657
 - [Devil] That's a good girl.

01:06:35.659 --> 01:06:37.392
      I will see you soon.

01:06:39.863 --> 01:06:41.930
        (phone beeping)

01:06:41.932 --> 01:06:43.865
     - You fucking bastard!

01:06:44.935 --> 01:06:46.368
    I am not afraid of you!

01:06:47.738 --> 01:06:49.537
 I'm not afraid of you anymore!

01:06:49.539 --> 01:06:50.972
        Do you hear me!

01:06:50.974 --> 01:06:52.874
     I'm not afraid of you!

01:06:54.878 --> 01:06:55.777
             Fuck!

01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:00.181
       (Rebecca sobbing)

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:13.395
        So guys, I guess
       it's not over yet.

01:07:32.849 --> 01:07:35.583
        (loud clanking)

01:07:48.865 --> 01:07:50.765
     What the fuck is that?

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:04.179
             Shit.

01:08:15.625 --> 01:08:16.524
        (loud thumping)

01:08:16.526 --> 01:08:17.392
             Fuck!

01:08:25.535 --> 01:08:27.535
         What the fuck!

01:08:27.537 --> 01:08:29.136
      Who made this mess?

01:08:32.341 --> 01:08:33.942
      (Rebecca screaming)

01:08:33.944 --> 01:08:35.477
       Stay away from me!

01:08:35.479 --> 01:08:36.377
           Stay away!

01:08:37.781 --> 01:08:39.113
        (Devil growling)

01:08:39.116 --> 01:08:41.149
     No, somebody help me!

01:08:41.151 --> 01:08:42.951
     Let go of me, let go!

01:08:45.421 --> 01:08:49.057
              No!
      (suspenseful music)

01:08:49.059 --> 01:08:52.460
    (approaching footsteps)

01:08:56.666 --> 01:08:58.233
       Stay away from me!

01:09:00.036 --> 01:09:04.139
        (Devil growling)
       (banging on door)

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:06.741
Leave me alone you motherfucker.

01:09:06.743 --> 01:09:08.076
        Leave me alone.

01:09:12.716 --> 01:09:15.617
       (Rebecca sobbing)

01:09:24.294 --> 01:09:26.995
        (phone ringing)

01:09:33.837 --> 01:09:36.470
       Hey, it's Rebecca,
        leave a message.

01:09:36.473 --> 01:09:39.207
        (phone beeping)

01:09:40.477 --> 01:09:42.977
       - [Peggy] I can't
   understand you Esmeralda,

01:09:42.979 --> 01:09:44.444
       what did you say?

01:09:45.782 --> 01:09:46.747
- [Esmeralda] I said you must--

01:09:46.750 --> 01:09:47.682
         (phone static)

01:09:47.684 --> 01:09:49.283
   - [Aunt Peggy] Must what?

01:09:49.286 --> 01:09:52.187
       Esmeralda, I can't
        understand you.

01:09:53.523 --> 01:09:56.858
     - [Esmeralda] You must
   tell her about the Devil.

01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:59.160
   The Devil, it's not gone!

01:09:59.162 --> 01:10:00.361
      - [Aunt Peggy] What?

01:10:00.363 --> 01:10:03.831
        Esmeralda, there
        must be a really

01:10:03.833 --> 01:10:05.133
  bad connection going on here

01:10:05.135 --> 01:10:07.468
       because I mean, I
      can barely hear you.

01:10:08.538 --> 01:10:10.572
 - [Esmeralda] She's not safe!

01:10:10.574 --> 01:10:11.806
         It's not over.

01:10:13.176 --> 01:10:14.809
      - [Aunt Peggy] What?

01:10:14.811 --> 01:10:16.211
        What's not over?

01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:20.081
  What are you talking about?

01:10:20.083 --> 01:10:20.982
           Esmeralda?

01:10:23.053 --> 01:10:23.918
           Esmeralda?

01:10:25.622 --> 01:10:27.188
       (tires screeching)

01:10:27.190 --> 01:10:28.690
      - [Father Brien] No!

01:10:28.692 --> 01:10:31.159
        (car shattering)

01:10:31.161 --> 01:10:32.994
       - [Aunt Peggy] Oh.

01:10:32.996 --> 01:10:33.895
           Oh my God.

01:10:35.765 --> 01:10:36.664
           Oh my God!

01:10:38.101 --> 01:10:39.000
           Esmeralda?

01:10:39.903 --> 01:10:40.802
           Esmeralda!

01:10:41.905 --> 01:10:43.271
           Esmeralda!

01:10:43.273 --> 01:10:46.174
       (phone dial tone)

01:10:49.112 --> 01:10:51.212
      - Esmeralda, Father
      Brien I'm so sorry.

01:11:03.393 --> 01:11:06.127
        (phone ringing)

01:11:21.311 --> 01:11:24.212
       (Rebecca sobbing)

01:11:26.516 --> 01:11:27.415
             Hello?

01:11:28.685 --> 01:11:30.485
       - Are you alright?

01:11:31.554 --> 01:11:32.453
         - I am Peggy.

01:11:33.657 --> 01:11:36.758
- I'm sorry to call you so late,

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:41.296
     but I really had this
      bad dream about you.

01:11:41.298 --> 01:11:43.464
Maybe it was the sandwich I ate

01:11:43.466 --> 01:11:44.966
     before I went to bed.

01:11:44.968 --> 01:11:47.435
       But are you okay?

01:11:48.338 --> 01:11:49.570
     - I'm okay Aunt Peggy.

01:11:51.941 --> 01:11:54.976
    - Is it about Esmeralda
       and Father Brien?

01:11:56.146 --> 01:11:57.979
        - It's a lot of
       things Aunt Peggy.

01:11:59.582 --> 01:12:03.284
      - Besides Esmeralda
       and Father Brien,

01:12:03.286 --> 01:12:05.553
is something else bothering you?

01:12:06.589 --> 01:12:09.157
         - Listen Aunt
      Peggy, I have to go.

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:12.894
     - Listen, I know that
       there's something

01:12:12.896 --> 01:12:15.430
  that you're not telling me.

01:12:15.432 --> 01:12:17.932
Esmeralda was going to tell me.

01:12:17.934 --> 01:12:20.668
   Why won't you talk to me?

01:12:20.670 --> 01:12:23.438
  - Because you wouldn't have
   believed me if I told you.

01:12:24.507 --> 01:12:26.541
       They were the only
     ones that believed me.

01:12:28.044 --> 01:12:29.277
    I have to prove it now.

01:12:30.447 --> 01:12:32.046
            - What?

01:12:32.048 --> 01:12:32.880
             What?

01:12:32.882 --> 01:12:34.882
      I don't understand.

01:12:35.885 --> 01:12:37.852
     - Aunt Peggy, please,

01:12:37.854 --> 01:12:39.087
       just pray for me.

01:12:40.056 --> 01:12:41.956
    Please just pray for me.

01:12:41.958 --> 01:12:43.925
       - Please, please,

01:12:43.927 --> 01:12:46.160
  you're starting to scare me.

01:12:46.162 --> 01:12:48.196
  - I have to go, I love you.

01:12:49.299 --> 01:12:52.166
 - Alright, I'll pray for you.

01:12:52.168 --> 01:12:53.501
     - [Rebecca] Okay bye.

01:12:53.503 --> 01:12:54.435
       - I love you too.

01:13:17.327 --> 01:13:20.228
   - Hey guys, it's day six.

01:13:21.965 --> 01:13:26.167
      Happy Halloween and
     happy birthday to me.

01:13:27.804 --> 01:13:30.872
I didn't wake up until just now.

01:13:30.874 --> 01:13:32.440
  I slept the whole day away.

01:13:32.442 --> 01:13:34.742
     It's crazy, I've never
       done that before.

01:13:35.945 --> 01:13:40.248
        Also, I'm almost
       completely blind.

01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:44.318
  My vision as if I'm looking
     through a microscope.

01:13:46.689 --> 01:13:51.325
    I feel me losing myself
     almost completely now.

01:13:53.730 --> 01:13:56.831
       In case this is my
    last diary to you guys,

01:13:58.268 --> 01:13:59.867
     all I can do is pray.

01:14:06.943 --> 01:14:07.842
           Dear God,

01:14:09.946 --> 01:14:12.747
please help me fight this demon.

01:14:14.117 --> 01:14:17.752
  Please give me the strength
and courage to go through this.

01:14:21.024 --> 01:14:23.057
     I'm sorry for messing
      with the Ouija board

01:14:23.059 --> 01:14:25.092
and I pray for your forgiveness.

01:14:26.696 --> 01:14:28.095
      I know I have sinned

01:14:28.932 --> 01:14:31.199
and if I must sacrifice my soul

01:14:31.201 --> 01:14:33.568
    in order for redemption
         then so be it.

01:14:35.438 --> 01:14:36.337
             Amen.

01:14:41.578 --> 01:14:44.212
       Just in case this
        is my last rite,

01:14:45.348 --> 01:14:45.847
       I just wanna say,

01:14:49.652 --> 01:14:54.555
      Esmy, thank you for
       your good memories

01:14:54.557 --> 01:14:55.990
      and your friendship.

01:14:57.894 --> 01:14:59.694
   I love you like a sister.

01:15:02.398 --> 01:15:05.233
       Dante, I love you

01:15:05.235 --> 01:15:06.767
  and I'm sorry if I hurt you.

01:15:06.769 --> 01:15:08.469
   I never meant to hurt you.

01:15:10.173 --> 01:15:12.507
           Mom, Dad,

01:15:14.210 --> 01:15:16.844
       I love you so much
        and I miss you.

01:15:18.982 --> 01:15:20.715
     Aunt Peggy I love you.

01:15:22.719 --> 01:15:26.020
         Everyone who's
      watching, thank you.

01:15:26.022 --> 01:15:27.421
  You helped me through this.

01:15:31.694 --> 01:15:32.593
            Goodbye.

01:15:34.831 --> 01:15:37.732
       (Rebecca sobbing)

01:16:29.452 --> 01:16:34.455
        (rushing winds)
       (Rebecca gasping)

01:16:45.602 --> 01:16:49.403
      (Rebecca screaming)

01:16:49.405 --> 01:16:50.304
             Help!

01:16:57.213 --> 01:16:58.746
            Help me!

01:16:58.748 --> 01:16:59.380
            Help me!

01:17:02.652 --> 01:17:03.551
           He's here!

01:17:04.654 --> 01:17:05.553
            Help me!

01:17:06.456 --> 01:17:07.355
            Help me!

01:17:08.658 --> 01:17:09.557
            Help me!

01:17:14.931 --> 01:17:17.832
       (ominous humming)

01:18:23.933 --> 01:18:26.734
        (birds chirping)

01:18:29.272 --> 01:18:30.104
       (knocking on door)

01:18:30.106 --> 01:18:30.938
           - Rebecca.

01:18:33.476 --> 01:18:34.341
         Are you here?

01:18:34.343 --> 01:18:35.509
           I'm back.

01:18:39.816 --> 01:18:41.048
            Rebecca.

01:18:41.050 --> 01:18:42.283
     Are you still in bed?

01:18:43.686 --> 01:18:45.953
      Get up you lazy bum,
      it's your birthday.

01:18:49.092 --> 01:18:50.391
   Rebecca, come on, get up.

01:18:50.393 --> 01:18:52.026
I wanna tell you about my trip.

01:18:53.429 --> 01:18:54.328
            Rebecca.

01:18:55.131 --> 01:18:56.430
             Whoa!

01:18:57.567 --> 01:18:58.933
       Did you and Dante
       have a wild night

01:18:58.935 --> 01:19:00.367
      last night or what?

01:19:02.472 --> 01:19:03.370
             Becky.

01:19:05.942 --> 01:19:07.208
     Rebecca are you okay?

01:19:08.978 --> 01:19:11.178
        (Esmy screaming)

01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:12.313
           Oh my God!

01:19:12.315 --> 01:19:13.214
           Oh my God.

01:19:18.187 --> 01:19:19.053
           Oh my God.

01:19:20.123 --> 01:19:21.655
             9-1-1!

01:19:21.657 --> 01:19:23.524
        I need someone!

01:19:23.526 --> 01:19:26.060
   I think my roommates dead!

01:19:26.062 --> 01:19:28.062
  I don't know what happened!

01:19:28.064 --> 01:19:29.730
         I don't know!

01:19:29.732 --> 01:19:32.767
 She's not moving or breathing!

01:19:32.769 --> 01:19:35.836
     She's got these things
       all over her face!

01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:40.541
 I need someone here right now!

01:19:40.543 --> 01:19:42.777
   Please, somebody get here!

01:19:44.247 --> 01:19:46.881
         (Esmy gasping)

01:20:00.997 --> 01:20:03.030
       (camera clicking)
   (faint dispatch speaking)

01:20:03.032 --> 01:20:05.266
     - [Male] I think they
    said the body's in here.

01:20:05.268 --> 01:20:06.700
  - Body's in here detective.

01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:11.939
            - Yeah.

01:20:19.315 --> 01:20:20.981
          - Oh Jesus.

01:20:29.091 --> 01:20:31.425
   What happened to her face?

01:20:32.428 --> 01:20:33.327
         - Looks like,

01:20:35.865 --> 01:20:39.400
        looks like post
     mortem discoloration.

01:20:39.402 --> 01:20:40.668
   If I had to take a guess,

01:20:40.670 --> 01:20:42.203
      I would say she was
      strangled to death.

01:20:46.008 --> 01:20:47.541
        - Have you ever
       seen a dead person

01:20:47.543 --> 01:20:49.777
   with veins pop like that?

01:20:49.779 --> 01:20:52.613
      - No, that's pretty
     peculiar right there.

01:20:52.615 --> 01:20:54.114
I think we're gonna have to have

01:20:54.116 --> 01:20:56.350
    the coroner help us out
   on this one to be honest.

01:20:57.987 --> 01:20:59.353
       - Rosa, when we're
      done would you mind

01:20:59.355 --> 01:21:01.589
      taking some closeups
        around her neck?

01:21:01.591 --> 01:21:02.489
        - On top of it.

01:21:03.659 --> 01:21:06.560
       (camera clicking)

01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:11.866
     - Alex, get two paper
   bags on her hands please?

01:21:11.868 --> 01:21:13.133
         - You got it.

01:21:13.135 --> 01:21:13.934
       - And Rosa, let's
       get some pictures

01:21:13.936 --> 01:21:15.736
     of the hands as well.

01:21:15.738 --> 01:21:16.637
        - [Rosa] Got it.

01:21:21.444 --> 01:21:24.778
           - Oh fuck!
        (ominous music)

01:21:24.780 --> 01:21:26.280
 - It's just a cadaveric spasm.

01:21:26.282 --> 01:21:27.748
   It's just a muscle spasm.

01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:30.084
     It's nothing to worry
   about, it's not uncommon.

01:21:30.086 --> 01:21:31.585
      But, step this way.

01:21:31.587 --> 01:21:33.220
       There's something
     I'd like to show you.

01:21:38.294 --> 01:21:40.361
 Got ourselves a web cam here.

01:21:40.363 --> 01:21:41.262
            - Whoa.

01:21:42.965 --> 01:21:44.431
  Look at that, it's still on.

01:21:45.568 --> 01:21:48.135
    - I wonder if the killer
    was stupid enough though

01:21:48.137 --> 01:21:51.205
      to record himself in
     the middle of the act.

01:21:52.341 --> 01:21:53.240
            - Bingo.

01:21:55.778 --> 01:21:58.579
- Well smile, you're on camera.

01:21:58.581 --> 01:22:01.282
       - Look, there's a
     chat going on as well.

01:22:01.284 --> 01:22:02.116
           - Oh yeah.

01:22:02.118 --> 01:22:03.083
     And it's still going.

01:22:03.085 --> 01:22:04.084
      That's interesting.

01:22:05.154 --> 01:22:06.720
            - Yeah.

01:22:06.722 --> 01:22:09.823
     Okay, well let's take
    it back to the station.

01:22:09.825 --> 01:22:12.026
       - No, you go ahead
   downstairs, I'll meet you.

01:22:12.028 --> 01:22:12.860
           - Alright.

01:22:12.862 --> 01:22:13.894
      - I'll wrap this up.

01:22:15.531 --> 01:22:18.933
       Yeah, just figure
      this out, let's see.

01:22:18.935 --> 01:22:20.267
        Ah, turn it off.

01:22:31.213 --> 01:22:33.747
    - Hi, my name is Dante.

01:22:33.749 --> 01:22:35.182
   I was Rebecca's boyfriend.

01:22:37.954 --> 01:22:40.287
     I just want to get you
     up to speed on things.

01:22:42.124 --> 01:22:44.425
      It's been a few days
      since Rebecca died.

01:22:45.995 --> 01:22:47.962
       I'm sorry, I feel
      so silly doing this.

01:22:49.031 --> 01:22:51.498
      I'm doing this only
    because I'm fond of her.

01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:53.600
     Well actually because
       the cops found it

01:22:53.602 --> 01:22:54.568
       and gave it to me.

01:22:57.573 --> 01:22:59.807
     I guess I'll read the
     rest of what it says.

01:23:03.245 --> 01:23:04.144
         And it reads:

01:23:11.187 --> 01:23:14.154
      "Dear Diary, if you
        are reading this

01:23:14.156 --> 01:23:15.389
    "it means that I am dead

01:23:15.391 --> 01:23:17.324
     "and I didn't survive
        the possession.

01:23:18.794 --> 01:23:21.695
        "The myths about
     demonic possession can
      be put to rest now.

01:23:21.697 --> 01:23:25.432
     "If the proof that you
 haven't seen make you believe,

01:23:25.434 --> 01:23:27.601
       "then I don't know
       what to tell you.

01:23:27.603 --> 01:23:29.603
     "Priests need to take
    this exorcism seriously

01:23:29.605 --> 01:23:31.305
      "and people need to
      realize that demonic

01:23:31.307 --> 01:23:33.707
 "possession is alive and well

01:23:33.709 --> 01:23:36.176
       "and can happen to
     anybody who unleashes

      with the instrument

       "of evil known as

01:23:42.284 --> 01:23:44.018

     "Hopefully I can stop

      "to anyone else like
    it has happened to me."

01:23:59.001 --> 01:24:00.534
            Rebecca.

01:24:00.536 --> 01:24:02.069
            Rebecca.

01:24:02.071 --> 01:24:05.739
     Wherever you are, just
   know you're truly missed.

01:24:07.476 --> 01:24:10.944
       You were the best
     girlfriend I ever had.

01:24:10.946 --> 01:24:16.016
            Goodbye.
         (Dante crying)

01:24:18.788 --> 01:24:21.588
        (Dante laughing)

01:24:26.295 --> 01:24:27.161
           I have it.

01:24:28.230 --> 01:24:29.496
     Mission accomplished.

01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:35.702
 I have served my master right.

01:24:35.704 --> 01:24:37.404
 He has rewarded me handsomely.

01:24:39.809 --> 01:24:41.442
          Not bad huh?

01:24:41.444 --> 01:24:43.410
      There's some people
        doing this too.

01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:46.947
       As you all know, I
     don't do the killings.

01:24:48.384 --> 01:24:51.585
    I just convince foolish
       girls to do this.

01:24:57.927 --> 01:25:00.861
  I gave Andrew $100 for this.

01:25:04.333 --> 01:25:06.333
       Money talks baby.

01:25:07.470 --> 01:25:10.437
        Everybody has a
     price in their heads.

01:25:12.341 --> 01:25:15.175
  You guys wanna see something
      cool before I leave?

01:25:15.177 --> 01:25:16.877
 Well just like in the movies,

01:25:18.380 --> 01:25:19.847
  you guys are in for a treat.

01:25:21.317 --> 01:25:22.382
        Check this out.

01:25:25.221 --> 01:25:30.290
         (Dante grunts)
         (deep whining)

01:25:49.578 --> 01:25:52.579
       (slow paced music)
