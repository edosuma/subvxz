WEBVTT

01:36.200 --> 01:38.328
- Potts?
- Yeah.

01:38.880 --> 01:39.881
Bill Potts?

01:40.400 --> 01:41.401
You wanted to see me?

01:42.040 --> 01:44.168
You're not a student of this university?

01:44.640 --> 01:45.846
No, I work in the canteen.

01:45.920 --> 01:48.207
- Yeah, but you come to my lectures.
- No, I don't.

01:48.440 --> 01:49.646
I never do that.

01:49.920 --> 01:50.921
I've seen you.

01:51.600 --> 01:54.604
Love your lectures,
they're totally awesome.

01:54.680 --> 01:56.569
Why did you come to my lectures,
when you're not a student?

01:56.680 --> 01:58.523
Okay, so my first day here,

01:58.640 --> 02:00.722
in the canteen, I was on chips.
There was this girl,

02:00.880 --> 02:02.405
student, beautiful,

02:02.480 --> 02:05.165
like a model,
only with talking and thinking.

02:05.440 --> 02:07.010
She looked at you and you perved.

02:07.280 --> 02:09.681
Every time. Automatic like physics,

02:09.840 --> 02:11.604
eye contact, perversion.

02:11.920 --> 02:13.604
So, I gave her extra chips.

02:13.680 --> 02:15.523
Every time, extra chips.

02:15.600 --> 02:17.170
Like a reward, for perversion.

02:17.240 --> 02:20.005
Every day, got myself on chips,
rewarded her.

02:20.080 --> 02:22.242
Then finally, finally, she looked at me,

02:23.280 --> 02:27.001
like she didn't notice that I actually
noticed all the extra chips.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.081
Do you know what I realised?

02:28.680 --> 02:29.681
She was fat.

02:31.280 --> 02:32.281
I had fatted her.

02:34.480 --> 02:35.766
That's life, isn't it?

02:35.840 --> 02:37.444
Beauty or chips? I like chips.

02:37.600 --> 02:39.921
So does she, so... That's okay.

02:40.680 --> 02:44.571
And how does that in any way explain
why you keep coming to my lectures?

02:45.120 --> 02:46.804
Yeah, it doesn't really, does it?

02:47.000 --> 02:48.843
I was hoping something would develop.

02:49.040 --> 02:50.041
What's that?

02:51.080 --> 02:52.320
A police telephone box?

02:53.920 --> 02:55.922
- Yeah.
- Did you build it from a kit?

02:56.720 --> 02:58.848
- No, it came like that.
- Then, how did you get it in here?

02:59.120 --> 03:00.884
The door is too small,
and so are the windows.

03:01.120 --> 03:02.929
I had the window and a part of the wall

03:03.040 --> 03:04.201
taken out, and it was lifted in.

03:04.360 --> 03:05.600
- Oh, with a crane?
- Yeah.

03:05.840 --> 03:07.888
With a crane.

03:08.280 --> 03:10.851
It's heavier than it looks.
Why do you keep coming to my lectures?

03:11.240 --> 03:12.241
Because I like them.

03:12.680 --> 03:14.887
Everybody likes them, they're amazing.

03:16.320 --> 03:18.163
- Why me?
- Why you, what?

03:18.240 --> 03:19.924
Well, plenty of people come
to your lectures

03:20.000 --> 03:21.411
that aren't supposed to,
why pick on me?

03:21.520 --> 03:23.010
Well, I noticed you.

03:23.080 --> 03:24.081
Yeah, but why?

03:26.560 --> 03:29.040
Well, most people, when they don't
understand something, they frown.

03:29.120 --> 03:30.360
You...

03:31.440 --> 03:32.441
Smile.

03:35.160 --> 03:36.161
Tell you what I don't understand.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.609
You've been lecturing here a long time,

03:39.000 --> 03:41.048
about 50 years, some people say.

03:41.280 --> 03:43.248
- My B-Line in the office says over 70.
- Yeah,

03:43.640 --> 03:45.404
and you're thinking,
"Well, he doesn't look old enough."

03:45.480 --> 03:48.245
No, I'm wondering what you're
supposed to be lecturing on?

03:48.680 --> 03:51.286
It's like the university let
you do whatever you like.

03:51.720 --> 03:54.291
One time, you were going to give
a lecture on quantum physics,

03:54.360 --> 03:55.361
you talked about poetry.

03:55.440 --> 03:57.044
Poetry, physics, same thing.

03:57.200 --> 03:58.645
How is it the same?

03:58.720 --> 04:00.961
Because of the rhymes,
what are you doing at this university?

04:01.040 --> 04:02.041
I always wanted to come here.

04:02.120 --> 04:03.770
Yeah, to serve chips?

04:05.400 --> 04:07.528
So anyway, am I nearly done?

04:07.760 --> 04:08.761
Do you wanna be?

04:09.120 --> 04:10.121
See ya.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.688
You ever get less
than a first and it's over.

04:15.560 --> 04:16.846
- You what?
- A first,

04:17.800 --> 04:18.801
every time,

04:18.920 --> 04:19.966
or I stop immediately.

04:20.079 --> 04:21.127
Stop what?

04:21.200 --> 04:22.884
Being your personal tutor.

04:24.560 --> 04:26.403
But I'm not a student.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.004
I'm not a part of the university,
I never even applied.

04:30.360 --> 04:31.646
We'll sort all of that out later.

04:31.800 --> 04:33.404
You kinda have to sort that out earlier.

04:33.720 --> 04:35.529
Leave it with me,
I'm assuming that it's a "yes"?

04:37.200 --> 04:38.247
Yes.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.482
I'll see you at 6:00 p.m. every weekday.

04:40.600 --> 04:42.887
I don't care who is dying,
never, ever be late.

04:42.960 --> 04:44.325
I'm very particular about time.

04:47.680 --> 04:48.681
Oh...

04:50.560 --> 04:52.767
People just call you "The Doctor".

04:53.600 --> 04:54.601
What do I call you?

04:55.360 --> 04:56.441
The Doctor.

04:56.680 --> 04:58.364
But Doctor's not a name.

04:58.640 --> 05:00.688
I can't just call you Doctor.

05:02.320 --> 05:03.321
Doctor what?

05:48.040 --> 05:49.769
Time. Time doesn't pass.

05:50.480 --> 05:52.562
The passage of time is an illusion,

05:52.640 --> 05:54.404
and life is the magician,

05:56.520 --> 06:00.081
because life only lets you
see one day at a time.

06:05.240 --> 06:06.730
You remember being alive yesterday,

06:06.800 --> 06:08.564
you hope you're going
to be alive tomorrow.

06:08.680 --> 06:10.762
So, it feels like you're travelling

06:11.000 --> 06:14.004
one to the other,
but nobody is moving anywhere.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.043
Movies don't really move.

06:17.960 --> 06:20.486
They're just pictures,
lots and lots of pictures.

06:20.560 --> 06:23.882
All of them still, none of them moving,
just frozen moments.

06:27.640 --> 06:31.406
If you experience those
pictures one after the other...

06:31.600 --> 06:33.364
then everything comes alive.

06:37.880 --> 06:38.881
Am I on time?

06:39.000 --> 06:40.764
That's a very big question.

06:47.320 --> 06:49.163
You know, you're my foster mum,

06:49.920 --> 06:51.445
he's like my foster tutor.

06:51.720 --> 06:53.768
Am I gonna have to break
every bone in his body?

06:54.400 --> 06:55.686
It's not like that.

06:55.960 --> 06:57.371
You need to keep your eye on men.

06:59.960 --> 07:02.088
Men aren't where
I keep my eye actually.

07:02.160 --> 07:04.447
Imagine if time all happened at once...

07:06.680 --> 07:09.126
every moment of your life

07:09.360 --> 07:11.089
laid out around you

07:12.880 --> 07:14.006
like a city.

07:14.080 --> 07:16.811
Streets full of buildings, made of days.

07:16.920 --> 07:20.083
The day you were born, the day you die,

07:20.240 --> 07:21.765
the day you fall in love,

07:21.920 --> 07:24.491
the day that love ends. A whole city,

07:24.680 --> 07:27.889
built from triumph and heartbreak

07:27.960 --> 07:31.169
and boredom and laughter
and cutting your toenails,

07:31.240 --> 07:33.561
it's the best place you'll ever be.

07:36.680 --> 07:40.082
Time is a structure,
relative to ourselves.

07:45.400 --> 07:46.401
I'll get him in.

07:46.680 --> 07:49.490
Time is the space
made by our lives,

07:51.200 --> 07:54.329
where we stand together forever.

07:55.520 --> 07:56.521
Time

07:56.680 --> 07:59.047
and relative dimension

08:00.760 --> 08:01.761
in

08:03.400 --> 08:04.447
Space.

08:05.760 --> 08:07.364
It means life.

08:10.520 --> 08:11.521
- Chips, yeah?
- Please.

08:31.040 --> 08:32.451
Huh, oh!

09:04.880 --> 09:07.611
So, you're tutoring her and...

09:07.680 --> 09:09.091
Mmm-hmm, yes I am.

09:10.320 --> 09:12.288
- Why?
- Why not?

09:12.360 --> 09:14.203
You're not supposed
to be get involved.

09:15.560 --> 09:17.164
What are you teaching her anyway?

09:17.320 --> 09:18.321
Everything.

09:18.800 --> 09:20.848
How can you teach
anyone everything?

09:20.920 --> 09:23.526
- Because everything rhymes.
- Oh.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.004
- Rotate it.
- Ah.

09:50.040 --> 09:52.247
The door upstairs,
how did you set the security?

09:52.880 --> 09:53.881
Friends only.

10:01.080 --> 10:03.003
So, turn it and then it'll...

10:03.440 --> 10:05.169
I'm turning it, help me.

10:32.560 --> 10:34.847
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.566
Sorry, can I ask?
What's that in your eye?

10:42.680 --> 10:44.808
It's just a defect in the iris.

10:45.040 --> 10:47.168
- Looks like a star.
- Well, it's a defect.

10:47.240 --> 10:48.685
At least,
it's a defect that looks like a star.

10:48.760 --> 10:50.091
I'm getting it fixed.

10:52.120 --> 10:53.451
Okay-

10:56.240 --> 10:57.730
Sorry, none of my business,

10:57.920 --> 11:00.571
but are you freaking out
about something?

11:05.080 --> 11:06.889
Please, you can say no.

11:07.240 --> 11:08.765
Would you come with me,

11:08.880 --> 11:10.166
can I show you something?

11:10.280 --> 11:11.281
God, yes!

11:13.840 --> 11:15.569
I love this place, don't you?

11:15.840 --> 11:17.683
- I hate it.
- Why?

11:17.760 --> 11:19.444
I don't know, I just do.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.889
Everywhere I go, I just wanna leave.

11:22.800 --> 11:23.801
Can I come, too?

11:25.480 --> 11:26.481
Maybe.

11:39.040 --> 11:40.451
There's a puddle over there.

11:41.240 --> 11:43.004
It hasn't rained for a week.

11:43.320 --> 11:46.642
Yeah, but... Well, you know,
half the students here are blokes.

11:46.880 --> 11:48.041
Go and look in it.

11:48.400 --> 11:50.323
- You want me to look in a puddle?
- Please.

11:59.240 --> 12:00.526
Okay, I'm lookin'.

12:01.960 --> 12:04.088
- What am I lookin' at?
- Your reflection.

12:06.320 --> 12:07.367
Yep, there it is.

12:08.160 --> 12:09.400
Did you see
what's wrong with it?

12:09.600 --> 12:11.841
My name's Bill, by the way.

12:11.960 --> 12:12.961
I'm Heather.

12:13.600 --> 12:14.681
Can you see what's wrong?

12:15.480 --> 12:16.970
Nothing, just looks like me.

12:19.720 --> 12:21.882
Oh! What is that?

12:24.440 --> 12:26.283
That's me, that's my face but

12:26.680 --> 12:28.045
it's wrong.

12:30.720 --> 12:31.721
Hey!

12:32.040 --> 12:33.849
Sorry, some other time.

12:35.600 --> 12:36.601
Promise?

12:41.560 --> 12:44.040
Pilot is located.

12:45.720 --> 12:48.564
Link is established.

13:09.520 --> 13:10.521
It's a rug.

13:12.080 --> 13:13.241
Haven't got you anything.

13:13.880 --> 13:14.881
It's okay.

13:14.960 --> 13:15.961
It was cheap.

13:24.040 --> 13:25.371
Going anywhere for Christmas?

13:25.720 --> 13:27.449
I never go anywhere.

13:27.520 --> 13:28.681
That's not true.

13:29.320 --> 13:30.810
You go places, I can tell.

13:31.680 --> 13:33.091
My mum always said, "With some people",

13:33.160 --> 13:34.810
"you can smell the wind
in their clothes".

13:35.280 --> 13:36.327
Hmm?

13:36.680 --> 13:37.681
She sounds...

13:38.920 --> 13:39.921
Nice.

13:40.680 --> 13:41.886
She died when I was a baby.

13:42.240 --> 13:43.924
- Oh.
- Yeah.

13:47.440 --> 13:50.046
If she died when you were a baby,
when did she say that?

13:51.040 --> 13:52.280
In my head.

13:54.400 --> 13:57.290
Yeah, I'm supposed to look like her,
but I don't really know.

13:58.160 --> 14:00.322
There's hardly any photographs.

14:00.400 --> 14:02.402
She hated having her picture taken.

14:03.680 --> 14:06.490
But if someone's gone,
do pictures really help?

14:10.760 --> 14:13.411
I thought you'd enjoy choosing
something for yourself,

14:13.600 --> 14:15.204
as you're always passing judgements.

14:17.520 --> 14:19.249
I hope you didn't spend
too much on this.

14:19.680 --> 14:21.205
Nah, this should cover it.

14:21.800 --> 14:22.801
What's that?

14:23.240 --> 14:26.403
Oh, I found that in the back of a
cupboard, with all your old stuff.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.082
Just photographs, of your mum.

14:29.600 --> 14:30.761
I didn't know we had 'em.

15:19.120 --> 15:20.121
Happy new term!

15:21.000 --> 15:22.206
With you in a moment.

15:27.920 --> 15:30.002
You said you needed
a crane to lift your box.

15:30.360 --> 15:31.964
Sorry, what did you say?

15:59.440 --> 16:00.441
Hey!

16:03.400 --> 16:04.970
Still making eyes at a puddle?

16:06.640 --> 16:08.688
Did you ever work out what
was wrong with your reflection?

16:09.280 --> 16:10.361
Nah.

16:10.920 --> 16:13.048
Come around, I'll show you.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.365
Promise you won't go.

16:16.440 --> 16:17.566
Promise.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.001
Okay-

16:39.840 --> 16:41.285
Yeah, no worries.

16:43.440 --> 16:45.568
Pilot confirmed,

16:45.640 --> 16:48.086
pilot engaged,

16:58.320 --> 16:59.321
What's wrong?

17:01.640 --> 17:03.085
She said it was a defect.

17:03.520 --> 17:06.444
But, what kind of a defect
puts a star in your eye?

17:07.560 --> 17:10.244
But that doesn't even matter
because she was right.

17:11.240 --> 17:13.288
There was something wrong when
you looked in the puddle.

17:14.880 --> 17:16.405
That was definitely my face.

17:16.800 --> 17:18.369
I see my face all the time.

17:18.720 --> 17:20.449
I never liked it,
it's all over the place.

17:20.520 --> 17:23.171
It's always doing expressions when
I'm trying to be enigmatic

17:23.240 --> 17:24.366
I know my face.

17:25.240 --> 17:27.288
And there was something wrong
with my face in the puddle.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.529
What could be wrong with your own face?

17:44.720 --> 17:45.721
Doctor!

17:50.640 --> 17:51.641
Doctor!

18:01.400 --> 18:03.164
- Why did you run like that?
- Like what?

18:03.280 --> 18:05.328
Like a penguin, with his arse on fire.

18:05.720 --> 18:06.721
Ergonomics.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.324
That's my face, yeah?

18:09.640 --> 18:10.846
I see you're a bit flexible
on the subject.

18:10.960 --> 18:11.961
Oh, you've no idea.

18:12.760 --> 18:14.728
Maybe it's got to do with
that thing in her eye.

18:14.800 --> 18:16.290
- How?
- Maybe she's like,

18:16.360 --> 18:17.691
affected by something.

18:17.760 --> 18:19.762
- By what?
- I don't know.

18:19.840 --> 18:23.083
Look, I know you know lots of stuff
about, well, basically everything,

18:23.240 --> 18:24.241
but do you know any sci-fi?

18:30.560 --> 18:31.641
- Go on.
- Well,

18:32.160 --> 18:34.162
what if she's possessed?

18:34.440 --> 18:35.487
Something like that?

18:36.120 --> 18:37.201
Possessed by what?

18:37.560 --> 18:38.686
I don't know.

18:39.800 --> 18:42.849
Saw this thing on Netflix,
lizards in people's brains.

18:43.920 --> 18:46.241
Right, so you meet a girl
with a discoloured iris,

18:46.360 --> 18:47.521
and your first thought is,

18:47.640 --> 18:48.766
she might have a lizard in her brain?

18:49.720 --> 18:51.609
I can see I'm gonna have to up my game.

18:54.840 --> 18:55.887
Oh!

18:56.200 --> 18:57.281
- What?
- Oh!

18:57.800 --> 19:00.087
- What is it, what?
- Oh, I get it.

19:00.280 --> 19:01.281
I see it.

19:01.920 --> 19:03.410
It was easy for you friend,

19:03.480 --> 19:04.481
because of her eye.

19:04.560 --> 19:05.971
What? Because it gives her
special powers?

19:06.040 --> 19:07.121
No!

19:07.440 --> 19:09.807
Because her face
isn't symmetrical, look.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.648
Look into the puddle.

19:14.080 --> 19:15.809
Your face looks wrong,

19:16.160 --> 19:17.321
because it looks right.

19:17.440 --> 19:20.284
What's the one thing you never see when
you're looking in a reflection?

19:20.720 --> 19:23.690
Your face. You never see
your face the right way around.

19:25.200 --> 19:28.204
Right, look for a freckle
or a funny tooth,

19:28.280 --> 19:30.203
- something that's not...
- My badge!

19:30.280 --> 19:33.523
See, your friend saw it straight
away because of her eye.

19:33.760 --> 19:35.967
But that means we're like, a reflection.

19:43.680 --> 19:45.489
It's not

19:45.560 --> 19:46.561
reflecting you,

19:46.720 --> 19:47.721
it's mimicking you.

19:49.600 --> 19:51.602
There's something in the water,
pretending to be you.

19:54.280 --> 19:55.281
Of course,

19:56.720 --> 19:57.721
it isn't water.

19:59.440 --> 20:00.726
Now, what are these?

20:00.800 --> 20:01.881
Let's have a look.

20:01.960 --> 20:03.200
What are they?

20:04.640 --> 20:05.766
Scorch marks.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.001
Interesting.

20:15.160 --> 20:16.161
Right. you!

20:18.640 --> 20:19.641
Let's get you on the bus.

20:19.720 --> 20:20.721
The what? The bus?

20:20.800 --> 20:22.450
Tutorial's over, take the night off.

20:22.520 --> 20:23.521
It's all cancelled.

20:23.640 --> 20:25.449
Go and be a proper student.

20:25.520 --> 20:27.807
Text, snogging, a vegan wrap.

20:27.920 --> 20:29.285
But what about the puddle?

20:29.360 --> 20:33.570
Oh, it's just some freak optical effect.
I'm bored already.

20:35.400 --> 20:39.962
Passenger selected,
pursuit engaged.

20:54.880 --> 20:57.531
Hey, I'll make you a cuppa for the bath.

21:13.760 --> 21:14.761
Hey.

21:15.040 --> 21:16.326
Sorry, I'm not there, love.

21:16.640 --> 21:19.325
But I think we both know,
it's time I treated myself.

21:19.960 --> 21:21.200
Are you with Neville?

21:21.280 --> 21:24.409
Why would! be back with Neville,
after last time?

21:24.720 --> 21:26.643
Why do you think I'm such an idiot?

21:27.320 --> 21:28.685
Well, you're calling from his phone.

21:31.720 --> 21:33.722
Is there someone staying here
in the flat?

21:34.440 --> 21:36.681
Of course not. No.
What are you talking about?

21:37.800 --> 21:41.361
Nothing, never mind.
I'll see you tomorrow.

21:58.360 --> 21:59.361
Hello?

22:02.680 --> 22:04.091
Is someone in there?

22:05.800 --> 22:06.926
Is that Barry?

22:07.640 --> 22:10.120
Because she's with Neville,
and it's not my fault.

22:20.120 --> 22:21.645
Sorry, I need to know who's in there.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.081
I'm coming in.

22:26.680 --> 22:27.727
Do you hear me?

22:31.760 --> 22:33.762
Make yourself decent.

22:58.240 --> 22:59.446
If that's Barry,

22:59.520 --> 23:01.921
let's not make this worse,
just say it's you.

23:44.200 --> 23:45.201
Hey!

24:27.360 --> 24:28.361
Hello.

24:29.200 --> 24:30.326
Hello.

24:36.520 --> 24:37.521
You scared me.

24:38.040 --> 24:39.041
You scared me.

25:13.160 --> 25:14.207
You're dead.

25:14.640 --> 25:15.926
You're dead.

25:31.320 --> 25:32.401
Hello, Bill.

25:33.640 --> 25:34.880
Oh...

25:38.960 --> 25:40.007
What's that?

25:48.080 --> 25:49.411
I'll tell you what it isn't.

25:50.120 --> 25:51.610
It isn't a freak optical effect.

26:01.120 --> 26:03.009
And it's following me.

26:10.840 --> 26:12.251
No. No. What are you doing?

26:14.320 --> 26:17.290
I'll tell you what,
let's just pop into my box.

26:17.360 --> 26:20.170
Your box? What good
is getting in your box going to do?

26:20.640 --> 26:23.166
What an extraordinarily long
and involved answer this is going to be.

26:26.600 --> 26:27.647
How do we stop her getting in?

26:27.720 --> 26:29.848
- We're trapped in here.
- Nothing gets through these doors.

26:30.600 --> 26:35.003
But they're made of wood.
They've got windows!

26:39.400 --> 26:42.688
Look. This is all mad, I know, but...

26:42.760 --> 26:44.922
That's the girl I told you about.
Heather.

26:46.200 --> 26:48.771
Only, I don't think it's really her.

26:50.840 --> 26:54.686
I know this is hard to believe. I know
you're not exactly a sci-fi person...

26:58.440 --> 27:01.250
Time and Relative Dimension in Space.

27:03.720 --> 27:05.882
TARDIS for short.

27:08.960 --> 27:10.564
You're safe in here.

27:10.640 --> 27:12.608
You're safe in here
and you always will be.

27:20.160 --> 27:21.207
Any questions?

27:25.320 --> 27:26.845
Is this a knock through?

27:26.920 --> 27:29.287
Well, in a way, yes.

27:31.920 --> 27:32.967
Look at this place.

27:35.960 --> 27:37.041
- It's like a...
- Spaceship.

27:37.120 --> 27:39.168
- Kitchen.
- A what?

27:39.440 --> 27:40.965
A really posh kitchen. All metal.

27:41.040 --> 27:44.044
What happened to the doors though?
Did you run out of money?

27:44.120 --> 27:48.091
What you are standing in
is a technological marvel.

27:48.560 --> 27:51.086
It is science beyond magic.

27:52.720 --> 27:55.121
This is the gateway
to everything that ever was.

27:56.320 --> 27:57.731
Whatever can be.

27:59.960 --> 28:01.325
Can I use the toilet?

28:03.000 --> 28:06.686
- Pardon?
- I've had a fright. I need the toilet.

28:07.200 --> 28:11.125
It's down there. First right, second
left, past the macaroon dispenser.

28:11.200 --> 28:13.771
- Thanks.
- Oh! Human.

28:14.400 --> 28:16.243
Human alert.
Do you want me to repel her?

28:16.320 --> 28:18.322
She's just passing through.
She wants to use the toilet.

28:18.400 --> 28:20.721
Oh. I'd give it a minute if I were you.

28:20.800 --> 28:23.007
Oh! What's that?

28:23.080 --> 28:27.369
We have a encroacher on campus.
Extra-terrestrial. We're under attack.

28:29.400 --> 28:30.481
Let's move.

28:32.800 --> 28:33.961
Oh, my God!

28:34.560 --> 28:37.086
- This isn't just a room, is it?
- No, it's not just a room.

28:38.160 --> 28:39.207
This is a lift!

28:45.000 --> 28:46.081
Well, come on.

28:58.360 --> 29:01.011
No interference here as far
as I can see. Vault secure.

29:03.400 --> 29:04.925
So, your box can move?

29:06.280 --> 29:07.327
It can go anywhere it likes.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.604
Mmm. Good, innit?

29:10.200 --> 29:11.884
Anywhere at all in the whole university?

29:11.960 --> 29:15.442
Is it my imagination or is this
taking longer than normal?

29:18.280 --> 29:22.524
Hang on.
The room's still inside the box.

29:23.480 --> 29:25.244
- This isn't a knock through.
- No.

29:25.760 --> 29:28.764
Doctor, it's bigger on the inside
than it is on the outside.

29:28.840 --> 29:30.524
Hey, hey! We got there.

29:32.760 --> 29:34.649
How is that possible?
How do you do that?

29:35.720 --> 29:41.568
Well first, you have to imagine a very
big box fitting inside a very small box.

29:42.240 --> 29:45.244
- Okay.
- Then, you have to make one.

29:46.080 --> 29:47.889
It's the second part
people normally get stuck on.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.804
Can we shut up, please.
Busy, busy.

29:49.880 --> 29:53.362
I need to know if there's any interest
in what's inside this vault.

29:53.440 --> 29:55.010
Why? What's inside it?

29:55.080 --> 29:57.208
Something I don't want anyone
being too curious about.

29:57.680 --> 29:59.330
So you put it
in the middle of a university?

29:59.400 --> 30:02.882
Oh, valid point. Yeah. Nice.

30:03.720 --> 30:06.166
Either the creature came here
specifically for what's in here

30:06.240 --> 30:07.446
or it's just a coincidence.

30:07.520 --> 30:10.444
- Just a coincidence.
- Well, we can't know that for sure.

30:10.960 --> 30:12.007
Yeah, we can.

30:12.960 --> 30:14.485
It was here for ages
before it did anything.

30:14.600 --> 30:16.682
If it had work to do,
why would it lie around in a puddle?

30:16.760 --> 30:18.250
I don't know. Maybe it's a student.

30:18.680 --> 30:22.162
Oh. Banter. It's good, this.

30:23.600 --> 30:24.647
Your go again.

30:32.080 --> 30:33.161
Nardole...

30:35.680 --> 30:39.969
We need to move away from the doors
and towards the TARDIS.

31:14.280 --> 31:15.486
What if it attacks us?

31:18.200 --> 31:19.725
Well that's good news.

31:20.560 --> 31:22.927
It means it's not interested
in what's inside the vault,

31:23.400 --> 31:24.606
it just wants to kill us.

31:25.280 --> 31:26.327
Oh.

31:32.280 --> 31:33.611
Run!

31:35.040 --> 31:37.771
It's not interested in the vault.
It's chasing us.

31:38.160 --> 31:41.403
Let's give it a proper challenge.
Let's see how far she's prepared to go.

31:42.400 --> 31:43.731
What about my friend?

31:43.800 --> 31:45.484
What about Heather? Can you save her?

31:47.280 --> 31:50.090
First things first.
Let's see if we can survive her.

32:13.160 --> 32:15.367
- But...
- Yes.

32:15.920 --> 32:17.763
- We've moved again.
- We have.

32:19.440 --> 32:20.805
- It was night...
- Yep.

32:20.880 --> 32:24.248
Now it's day.

32:25.080 --> 32:26.127
Definitely day.

32:27.040 --> 32:29.930
- My God. We travelled in time?
- No, of course not.

32:30.280 --> 32:31.930
We've travelled to Australia!

32:44.560 --> 32:46.608
- How are you doing?
- How do you think?

32:52.640 --> 32:54.165
Right. Um...

32:56.280 --> 32:57.361
How do I help?

32:58.440 --> 33:00.249
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- No.

33:00.320 --> 33:02.846
- Can I anyway?
- Yes.

33:03.280 --> 33:05.567
- Are you from space?
- No, of course not.

33:07.080 --> 33:10.482
Nobody's from space.
I'm from a planet like everybody else.

33:10.560 --> 33:11.561
This planet?

33:13.600 --> 33:15.125
No, not specifically this one.

33:15.200 --> 33:17.089
Doesn't make sense then.

33:17.920 --> 33:19.729
- What doesn't?
- TARDIS.

33:20.320 --> 33:23.290
If you're from another planet,
why would you name your box in English?

33:23.360 --> 33:25.567
Those initials wouldn't work
in any other language!

33:25.640 --> 33:28.291
- People don't generally bring that up.
- It looks a phone box.

33:28.360 --> 33:31.842
Yes. Well, that's the cloaking device.
It sort of hides itself.

33:32.440 --> 33:34.602
It's hidden itself as box
with "Pull to enter" on the front.

33:35.240 --> 33:38.722
Uh-huh, it's stuck. It's supposed
to blend in but it's broken.

33:49.200 --> 33:50.247
Doctor...

33:51.920 --> 33:54.400
Out! Out! Everybody out! Shark attack.

34:00.480 --> 34:02.562
- Where are we going?
- As far as we can.

34:02.680 --> 34:06.048
She made Australia in a minute.
Let's see what she can really do.

34:06.120 --> 34:08.327
Sir, we're leaving Earth.
What about the vault?

34:08.440 --> 34:11.808
Oh, we're fine. If there's any trouble,
I'll get a message on this.

34:11.880 --> 34:13.723
Let's see how long
it takes her to get here.

34:14.880 --> 34:15.927
Where are we?

34:17.239 --> 34:18.730
Other end of the universe.

34:20.040 --> 34:24.920
23 million years in the future.

34:27.800 --> 34:29.928
Oh yes, it's a time machine, too.

34:53.320 --> 34:55.891
So, this is somewhere else.

34:55.960 --> 34:59.203
This is a different planet.
Not Earth, a different one.

34:59.760 --> 35:01.046
That's the general idea.

35:05.160 --> 35:07.606
That's different sky.
Is it made of something different?

35:07.680 --> 35:08.761
What is sky made of?

35:08.840 --> 35:10.524
- Lemon drops.
- Really?

35:10.600 --> 35:11.840
No. But wouldn't that be nice.

35:12.320 --> 35:14.288
You can be very silly sometimes.
Do you know that?

35:15.400 --> 35:19.724
So, how do we know
this water thing is actually dangerous?

35:19.800 --> 35:22.644
- Because most things are.
- Hmm. That's true.

35:22.720 --> 35:25.291
- Why? Is everything out here evil?
- Hardly anything is evil.

35:25.640 --> 35:27.130
But most things are hungry.

35:27.560 --> 35:29.642
Hunger looks very like evil
from the wrong end of the cutlery.

35:29.720 --> 35:32.007
Or do you think that
your bacon sandwich loves you back?

35:32.800 --> 35:35.451
So what is it?
And what was it doing on Earth?

35:35.520 --> 35:39.002
Well, there were scorch marks
on the concrete where we found it,

35:39.560 --> 35:41.801
could have been left by a shuttle craft.

35:42.960 --> 35:44.564
The puddle, what did it look like?

35:44.680 --> 35:46.569
I mean, if that was a car
what would you say that was?

35:47.560 --> 35:49.050
An oil leak?

35:50.280 --> 35:52.089
So it's space engine oil.

35:52.160 --> 35:55.164
Intelligent oil.
Super intelligent space oil.

35:55.240 --> 35:57.004
No! Part of the ship itself.

35:57.080 --> 35:59.560
Shape-shifting fluid
that becomes anything it needs to be.

36:00.600 --> 36:01.647
Oh, seriously?

36:01.720 --> 36:04.485
But it spent ages laying
around being a puddle. What changed?

36:04.680 --> 36:08.890
Your friend. She looked into it,
didn't she? More than once.

36:08.960 --> 36:10.007
So?

36:10.760 --> 36:13.047
Maybe it saw something it needed.

36:13.120 --> 36:16.681
What was she like, your friend?
What did she want? What did she need.

36:17.840 --> 36:19.285
Everywhere I go, I just wanna leave.

36:23.240 --> 36:24.480
I think she wanted to leave.

36:25.400 --> 36:26.481
See.

36:27.440 --> 36:29.568
The puddle found a passenger.

36:29.840 --> 36:35.563
A left-behind droplet of a liquid
spaceship. Single tear drop.

36:35.640 --> 36:37.244
Alone in a strange world.

36:37.320 --> 36:41.166
Then, one day it finds someone
who wants to fly away.

36:41.240 --> 36:43.242
Not just the passenger...
More than a passenger.

36:43.320 --> 36:45.891
It found a pilot so it ate her!

36:47.840 --> 36:49.842
So, why is it chasing this one?

36:49.920 --> 36:53.163
- Everything wants, everything needs.
- But why does it want her?

36:53.240 --> 36:55.971
I don't know.
I don't know everything, Nardole.

36:56.040 --> 36:57.644
I don't have it all written down.

36:57.720 --> 36:59.006
You act like you do.

36:59.080 --> 37:00.844
I act like I do because I don't.

37:00.920 --> 37:02.888
It must be looking
for something.

37:02.960 --> 37:04.564
Of course it is. Everything is.

37:04.640 --> 37:05.687
But what?

37:05.760 --> 37:09.287
What, in the end,
are any of us looking for?

37:09.360 --> 37:12.682
We're looking for someone
who's looking for us.

37:14.480 --> 37:16.528
Hey! Still making eyes at a puddle?

37:19.960 --> 37:21.564
Bill!

37:22.840 --> 37:23.841
Bill.

37:27.080 --> 37:28.206
Back to the TARDIS.

37:34.600 --> 37:38.650
Okay. It's fast, it time travels
and never gives up.

37:40.400 --> 37:41.447
Plan!

37:42.160 --> 37:43.241
Basic sterilization.

37:43.320 --> 37:45.891
We're going to run that thing through
the deadliest fire in the universe.

37:45.960 --> 37:48.042
Yes! That sounds excellent.

37:48.120 --> 37:51.408
"The deadliest fire in the universe."
That's definitely good.

37:51.480 --> 37:53.164
- How do we do that?
- The only way we can,

37:53.240 --> 37:55.447
- we run through it first.
- Less good now.

37:57.720 --> 38:00.963
No, not there. I don't like it there!

38:03.480 --> 38:05.562
- Nardole!
- I don't like there.

38:08.600 --> 38:10.921
I want you running interference,
can you do that?

38:11.000 --> 38:12.445
- Can I say no, sir?
- No!

38:12.520 --> 38:13.965
- Yes, then.
- Thank you.

38:14.040 --> 38:15.087
But no, really.

38:15.160 --> 38:16.161
Where are we?

38:16.240 --> 38:18.049
Well, we're basically
in the middle of a war.

38:18.120 --> 38:22.808
No, but... It's a war zone.
And this is just your basic skirmish.

38:22.880 --> 38:24.962
And it's not as bad as it sounds,
I promise you.

38:25.040 --> 38:27.646
Come on. I've got friends here.
Old friends.

38:29.280 --> 38:30.520
I say friends...

38:30.920 --> 38:33.048
The Doctor is detected.

38:33.520 --> 38:35.887
Seek. Locate. Destroy.

38:39.480 --> 38:42.962
- Are we still in the future?
- No. This is the past.

38:43.440 --> 38:44.965
Doesn't look like the past.

38:47.200 --> 38:49.680
- Are we safe here?
- Well, that's up to Nardole.

38:49.760 --> 38:50.761
So probably not.

38:52.120 --> 38:53.281
Oh.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.287
Oh... Oh!

38:58.120 --> 38:59.645
Keep moving, Doctor.

38:59.720 --> 39:02.246
- Where are going?
- Into the fire. Come on.

39:10.360 --> 39:12.966
Move! Move! Move!

39:13.040 --> 39:14.041
Who are those guys?

39:17.040 --> 39:19.281
Never mind them.
It's who they're firing at.

39:32.840 --> 39:33.887
Come on.

39:36.160 --> 39:38.003
What's that?

39:38.080 --> 39:39.889
The deadliest fire
in the universe.

39:39.960 --> 39:43.567
Identify, intruder. Identify.

39:44.440 --> 39:46.204
Scan this device and identify me.

39:46.280 --> 39:49.090
You are the Doctor.
You are an enemy of the Daleks!

39:49.400 --> 39:50.526
Oh, yes I am.

39:50.600 --> 39:52.125
Exterminate!

39:54.240 --> 39:55.844
Exterminate.

39:56.360 --> 39:57.885
Exterminate.

39:59.120 --> 40:00.565
Exterminate.

40:03.400 --> 40:04.811
Exterminate.

40:10.480 --> 40:11.720
- What was that thing?
- A Dalek.

40:11.800 --> 40:13.723
- A what?
- A Dalek.

40:13.800 --> 40:15.006
What's a Dalek?

40:15.080 --> 40:16.764
Never mind. It's a Dalek.

40:17.680 --> 40:19.045
Exterminate!

40:26.840 --> 40:29.810
Exterminate...

40:30.040 --> 40:33.806
That's wrong.
I know my Daleks and that's wrong.

40:37.680 --> 40:38.920
Oh, I see.

40:40.120 --> 40:41.360
You see what?

40:41.440 --> 40:43.966
I've sealed the area.
All the Daleks are quarantined.

40:44.040 --> 40:45.041
Except that one!

40:45.680 --> 40:48.365
It's okay, this isn't a Dalek. Look.

40:49.800 --> 40:50.961
Look at the eye.

40:51.840 --> 40:52.887
Heather.

41:11.680 --> 41:13.569
- Heather.
- Interesting.

41:13.640 --> 41:16.166
You had a gun but you didn't use it.
Why?

41:16.240 --> 41:18.561
You've already taken one person
from Earth.

41:19.240 --> 41:24.087
I'm gonna let that pass because I have
to, but I will not let you take another.

41:25.760 --> 41:26.841
Go.

41:29.160 --> 41:30.844
Just go now. Fly away.

41:36.920 --> 41:38.251
Why won't you just go?

41:46.120 --> 41:48.771
- Promise you won't go.
- Promise.

41:50.240 --> 41:51.480
Oh, my God.

41:52.080 --> 41:53.241
I understand.

41:53.720 --> 41:54.846
You what?

41:54.920 --> 41:56.046
The last thing she said to me.

41:56.120 --> 41:57.804
She promised she wouldn't
leave without me.

41:58.200 --> 42:01.807
Her last conscious thought,
driving her across the universe.

42:01.960 --> 42:05.726
- Never underestimate a crush.
- You don't have to tell me.

42:05.960 --> 42:08.770
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

42:10.080 --> 42:13.527
She's not chasing you,
she's inviting you.

42:14.240 --> 42:17.961
Release her.
Release her from her promise.

42:28.360 --> 42:29.361
You have to let me go.

42:30.520 --> 42:32.010
You have to let me go.

42:33.360 --> 42:34.441
I will.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.126
I will.

42:43.640 --> 42:45.130
I really liked you.

42:46.040 --> 42:47.565
I really liked you.

42:56.800 --> 42:57.847
Bill.

42:59.400 --> 43:00.640
Don't! Don't!

43:01.560 --> 43:06.009
Don't do that. Listen.
Please, just listen to him.

43:09.040 --> 43:11.042
Don't! Don't! Bill, let go!

43:13.400 --> 43:14.526
Bill, listen to me.

43:15.040 --> 43:17.805
Wha te ver she's showing you,
wha te ver she's letting you see,

43:17.880 --> 43:19.120
it's a lure.

43:19.480 --> 43:22.927
It's a trap.
She's making you part of her,

43:23.000 --> 43:24.650
and you can never come back.

43:24.960 --> 43:26.644
I see what you see.

43:28.640 --> 43:30.483
It's beautiful.

43:31.040 --> 43:32.883
Bill, let go! You have to let go!

43:33.800 --> 43:35.723
She is not human any more.

43:38.480 --> 43:40.164
Goodbye, Heather.

43:42.720 --> 43:45.166
Good bye, Bill.

43:47.160 --> 43:48.491
Whoa!

43:49.720 --> 43:51.131
Bill. Bill!

44:01.160 --> 44:02.207
Are you all right?

44:04.560 --> 44:05.800
Yeah, I think so.

44:14.560 --> 44:15.971
You don't look all right.

44:16.240 --> 44:17.321
She's fine.

44:19.040 --> 44:21.008
That's the Doctor for you.

44:21.640 --> 44:23.449
Never notices the tears.

44:31.400 --> 44:32.811
I don't think they're mine.

44:42.360 --> 44:44.567
The vault alarm went off,
but it was nothing.

44:44.640 --> 44:47.883
A student was sick outside and it
registered as a biological attack.

44:50.440 --> 44:52.044
I saw it all for a moment.

44:53.440 --> 44:54.851
Everything out there.

44:55.080 --> 44:57.606
She was going to let me fly with her,
she was inviting me.

44:58.160 --> 45:00.367
- But I was too scared.
- Scared is good.

45:01.600 --> 45:04.570
Scared is rational.
She wasn't human any more.

45:04.920 --> 45:06.126
Will we see her again?

45:08.360 --> 45:09.521
Don't see how.

45:15.680 --> 45:18.286
No, no, no, no, no.
You have to forget about that.

45:18.840 --> 45:20.080
I don't see how I can.

45:21.360 --> 45:22.566
I do.

45:25.400 --> 45:26.845
Come here, Bill.

45:28.960 --> 45:30.121
What's up?

45:31.040 --> 45:33.771
- I just want to fix something...
- Whoa! What are you doing?

45:33.880 --> 45:36.531
- Don't worry, this won't hurt at all.
- No, but tell me.

45:36.800 --> 45:37.847
Nothing.

45:38.280 --> 45:40.408
Yeah. Because I think
you were going to wipe my memory.

45:42.400 --> 45:43.925
I'm not stupid, you know.

45:44.720 --> 45:45.721
What's the trouble with you?

45:45.800 --> 45:46.847
You don't think
anyone's ever seen a movie?

45:46.920 --> 45:48.843
I know what a mind-wipe looks like.

45:48.920 --> 45:50.888
I have no choice, I'm here for a reason.

45:50.960 --> 45:53.770
I am in disguise.
I have promises to keep.

45:54.400 --> 45:56.846
No one can know about me.

45:56.920 --> 46:00.129
This is the most exciting thing
that's ever happened to me in my life.

46:00.200 --> 46:02.646
- The only exciting thing.
- I'm sorry.

46:04.240 --> 46:06.208
Okay.
Let me remember just for a week.

46:06.280 --> 46:07.281
Just a week.

46:08.240 --> 46:10.242
Okay. Well, just for tonight.
Just one night.

46:10.520 --> 46:13.330
Come on, let me have
some good dreams for once.

46:16.840 --> 46:17.921
Okay-

46:20.720 --> 46:21.801
Do what you got to do.

46:24.720 --> 46:25.801
But imagine...

46:27.240 --> 46:30.562
just imagine how it would feel
if someone did this to you.

46:46.440 --> 46:47.521
Get out.

46:47.760 --> 46:49.000
- What?
- You can keep your memories.

46:49.080 --> 46:50.809
Now get out before I change my mind.

46:51.520 --> 46:54.410
Don't speak. Don't start.
Just run. Now. Go!

47:02.920 --> 47:03.967
Shut up.

47:04.440 --> 47:05.930
You shut up as well.

47:08.520 --> 47:11.091
Will you all please just leave me alone.

47:11.160 --> 47:13.606
I can't do that any more, I promised.

47:40.240 --> 47:42.242
It's a big universe...

47:42.720 --> 47:44.722
But maybe one day we'll find her.

47:54.120 --> 47:55.645
What changed your mind?

48:00.880 --> 48:01.961
Time.

48:04.080 --> 48:05.161
Time?

48:07.720 --> 48:09.722
And Relative Dimension in Space.

48:21.360 --> 48:22.646
It means...

48:23.600 --> 48:24.726
What the hell.

48:36.280 --> 48:38.009
This is one
of the Earth's first colonies.

48:38.080 --> 48:41.004
- What are they, alien birds?
- Tiny robots.

48:41.320 --> 48:42.685
That is a robot.

48:42.760 --> 48:43.921
He speaks emoji.

48:44.000 --> 48:45.604
Where are all the people?

48:46.000 --> 48:47.161
Ah!

48:47.280 --> 48:48.281
What, you're going back in?

48:48.360 --> 48:50.249
I'm having this really
childish impulse to blow it up.

48:55.840 --> 48:57.330
- You're the one who should be afraid.
- Never.

48:57.760 --> 48:58.807
Get ready.

49:00.760 --> 49:01.807
I'm the Doctor.

49:02.560 --> 49:05.962
I've been standing by the gates
of your world, keeping you all safe.

49:06.440 --> 49:07.646
I'm not stopping now.

49:07.720 --> 49:09.404
Any questions?
