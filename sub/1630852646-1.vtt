00:18.800 --> 00:20.680
<i>I created this Lamborghini</i>

00:21.200 --> 00:22.640
<i>for the night.</i>

00:37.240 --> 00:38.440
<i>Driving in a gleaming car</i>

00:39.840 --> 00:42.560
<i>makes me feel like a pilot.</i>

00:44.320 --> 00:45.160
<i>It's electrifying.</i>

01:06.360 --> 01:09.800
After so much excitement,
I'd like to bring it down a notch.

01:33.720 --> 01:37.960
We call it <i>hataraki ari</i>
which means "working ants."

01:54.520 --> 01:58.000
In Tokyo at night,
people get released from their stresses.

01:58.600 --> 01:59.800
When night falls,

02:00.960 --> 02:03.320
many people completely flip their switch.

02:03.800 --> 02:05.680
It's time to take off their daytime fronts

02:05.760 --> 02:07.760
and return to who they really are.

02:16.880 --> 02:20.120
At night, my time is my own.

02:20.600 --> 02:23.960
Tokyo is a city of possibilities.

02:41.280 --> 02:44.040
Tokyo at night isn't the clean,

02:44.120 --> 02:47.320
efficient, and orderly city of the day.

02:47.400 --> 02:48.840
It's full of vibrancy

02:48.920 --> 02:51.920
that you don't find
in Japanese guidebooks.

02:52.760 --> 02:56.200
The city is lit up in neon

02:56.280 --> 02:58.920
and it feels like everyone is still awake.

03:00.560 --> 03:02.880
Old or young, it's a time when people

03:02.960 --> 03:05.480
give free rein to their inner selves.

03:15.960 --> 03:17.560
My name is Sumiko Iwamuro.

03:18.160 --> 03:19.560
I'm 85 years old.

03:21.280 --> 03:25.640
I was born in January 1935.

03:25.720 --> 03:30.440
This is my CDJ that I use to practice.

03:30.520 --> 03:33.640
I put in a CD

03:33.720 --> 03:38.240
or USB to practice at home.

03:40.520 --> 03:43.680
I started DJing around eight years ago.

03:45.560 --> 03:48.840
A friend held an event

03:48.920 --> 03:52.600
at my restaurant.

03:53.160 --> 03:54.600
A techno party.

03:56.360 --> 03:58.320
Then someone asked

03:58.400 --> 04:02.120
if I wanted to try DJing.

04:03.360 --> 04:05.480
I just had to stand there

04:05.560 --> 04:06.920
like a monkey.

04:07.520 --> 04:09.160
It was fun.

04:11.120 --> 04:12.160
After that,

04:12.240 --> 04:15.040
I went to DJ school.

04:15.120 --> 04:16.760
It was so difficult.

04:16.840 --> 04:19.040
I was always getting told off.

04:19.920 --> 04:21.760
You have to match the beat

04:22.360 --> 04:24.680
and operate all the equipment.

04:25.240 --> 04:27.200
I was so happy

04:27.280 --> 04:29.800
when I started to get the hang of it.

04:30.880 --> 04:34.680
And now after work,

04:34.760 --> 04:37.400
I perform at a monthly event

04:37.480 --> 04:40.560
called the Tokyo Decadance.

04:41.480 --> 04:44.360
I didn't call myself Sumirock.

04:44.920 --> 04:45.960
My friends did.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.640
They took Sumi from my first name, Sumiko,

04:48.720 --> 04:53.960
and Rock from my last name, Iwamuro,
which means "rock room."

04:55.840 --> 05:00.120
I'm performing at one o'clock today,
so I am a bit nervous.

05:01.760 --> 05:04.520
My technique is still quite raw.

05:05.080 --> 05:08.400
I need to work on it more.

05:13.280 --> 05:14.920
I love sequins.

05:15.760 --> 05:18.400
If I'm too flashy

05:18.480 --> 05:21.840
people will think I'm crazy.

05:22.440 --> 05:24.480
So I go for just a little flashy.

05:24.560 --> 05:27.040
I like a snug fit.

05:35.400 --> 05:38.680
-There you go.
-Oh, thank you.

05:39.240 --> 05:42.920
I work six days a week

05:43.000 --> 05:46.920
from four in the afternoon
to almost eleven.

05:47.760 --> 05:49.920
There you go.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.200
Your wife?

05:55.560 --> 05:57.360
-Future wife.
-Future wife?

05:59.360 --> 06:00.520
I see.

06:02.320 --> 06:08.920
My father opened the restaurant in 1954.

06:10.680 --> 06:15.000
We opened up when I was 19.

06:15.760 --> 06:17.440
The one sitting is me.

06:20.160 --> 06:22.560
During the war,

06:23.400 --> 06:29.720
we had an old music player
called a gramophone.

06:29.800 --> 06:31.400
We'd put a cushion over it

06:33.080 --> 06:35.240
and listen to jazz with my father.

06:35.320 --> 06:37.520
We didn't want our neighbors

06:38.080 --> 06:41.120
to know we were listening to enemy music.

06:42.520 --> 06:47.000
After that,
my father worked as a jazz drummer,

06:48.080 --> 06:54.280
and his company put on shows
for American soldiers.

06:55.920 --> 07:02.400
He had a hard time with the hours and pay

07:03.880 --> 07:07.000
so he probably didn't want his kids

07:07.080 --> 07:10.880
to go through such a tough experience.

07:11.680 --> 07:15.000
He forbade me from studying music.

07:16.160 --> 07:17.360
Okay, thanks.

07:18.840 --> 07:22.480
Stir-fried clams and
stir-fried morning glory.

07:22.560 --> 07:24.440
Where are you DJing tonight?

07:24.520 --> 07:25.440
In Kabukicho.

07:25.520 --> 07:26.760
Wow, Kabukicho.

07:27.920 --> 07:29.040
At one o'clock.

07:29.520 --> 07:30.800
Oh, one at night.

07:36.440 --> 07:37.960
To me, music

07:38.040 --> 07:43.360
is something I can't live without.

07:45.240 --> 07:47.880
Although it comes

07:48.440 --> 07:51.520
after water and air.

08:22.440 --> 08:25.160
My name is Rogerio Igarashi Vaz.

08:29.840 --> 08:33.840
I was born in Brazil.
My grandparents were Japanese.

08:35.000 --> 08:39.159
Since I had a Japanese background,
I wanted to take a look at how it was.

08:39.240 --> 08:40.840
The real Japan.

08:59.480 --> 09:00.720
Bar Trench.

09:00.800 --> 09:03.920
Voted one of Asia's 50 best bars,

09:04.000 --> 09:07.280
it was one of the early pioneers
of Tokyo's cocktail scene.

09:08.360 --> 09:10.240
The idea of this cocktail

09:10.320 --> 09:13.520
is to use clarified grapefruit

09:13.600 --> 09:17.360
with a gin base, instead of vodka.

09:17.440 --> 09:18.400
Using gin, okay.

09:31.640 --> 09:32.520
How is it?

09:33.080 --> 09:36.040
Spicy with a bitter kick.

09:36.120 --> 09:37.240
It's good.

09:38.840 --> 09:42.520
He uses ordinary ingredients
like paprika and carrots.

09:43.400 --> 09:46.120
I'm learning to visualize

09:46.720 --> 09:48.880
and mix ingredients like that.

10:05.960 --> 10:06.800
Good evening.

10:06.880 --> 10:07.720
Good evening.

10:08.320 --> 10:09.880
What would you like to drink?

10:09.960 --> 10:14.040
-I'll have to go for the absinthe.
-We have this Swiss and French absinthe.

10:15.440 --> 10:19.960
Attentive Japanese service
is called <i>omotenashi,</i>

10:20.040 --> 10:23.880
and its spirit is central
to all social interactions in Japan.

10:25.320 --> 10:30.520
The bartender can't be
too friendly or too aloof.

10:31.080 --> 10:33.320
They need to maintain
just the right distance

10:33.400 --> 10:35.680
to let their customers relax.

11:38.160 --> 11:41.600
Maybe the garibaldi for you.
It's an Italian cocktail.

11:41.680 --> 11:43.000
Okay, let's go for it.

11:44.920 --> 11:47.760
Trench is getting famous around the world,

11:47.840 --> 11:49.520
so I feel proud.

12:04.040 --> 12:05.640
Here you go.

12:05.720 --> 12:07.640
Your garibaldi. Enjoy.

12:25.400 --> 12:27.120
Driving in Tokyo

12:28.200 --> 12:30.920
is like racing through space.

12:32.520 --> 12:33.960
I'm Shinichi Morohoshi.

12:46.760 --> 12:49.160
Hey, how are you?

12:50.560 --> 12:51.840
We've got a lot of cars.

12:54.360 --> 12:58.440
Tokyo has a culture

12:58.520 --> 13:00.880
of customizing all sorts of cars.

13:04.480 --> 13:07.760
For people into customizing,

13:07.840 --> 13:09.880
it's like we share an internal bond.

13:23.200 --> 13:25.880
There are lots of Lamborghinis in Tokyo

13:25.960 --> 13:28.920
but it's boring
to have the same as others.

13:31.120 --> 13:34.680
My friends feel the same way,

13:35.680 --> 13:38.680
so we spend even more money
on customizations.

13:43.520 --> 13:45.640
-Are these all SS20 crystals?
-That's right.

13:46.320 --> 13:48.520
There are 1,500 now.

13:50.280 --> 13:51.800
I'll use 10,000 in total.

13:53.400 --> 13:56.520
This is a shop that customizes

13:57.280 --> 13:59.440
my Lamborghini creations.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.520
My favorite now

14:02.600 --> 14:04.240
is this Lamborghini.

14:05.680 --> 14:08.600
I just love this light.

14:10.600 --> 14:13.160
The Lamborghini Countach

14:13.240 --> 14:15.840
came out when I was young,

14:16.640 --> 14:18.440
and seeing the doors

14:18.520 --> 14:19.960
swing upwards

14:21.040 --> 14:22.760
had a big impact on me.

14:22.840 --> 14:25.000
I swore to myself

14:25.080 --> 14:26.440
I'd drive one someday.

14:26.520 --> 14:28.440
So I worked hard

14:28.520 --> 14:30.560
and bought my first Lamborghini at 32.

14:31.400 --> 14:32.680
Since then,

14:33.160 --> 14:36.040
I've bought and sold around 20 of them.

14:37.240 --> 14:39.280
This is a customization

14:39.880 --> 14:40.760
that I love.

14:49.760 --> 14:51.160
In Japanese society,

14:51.240 --> 14:54.400
the nail that sticks out
gets hammered down.

14:55.080 --> 14:57.360
They think it's bad to stand out.

14:58.520 --> 15:00.720
This might not fit so well

15:00.800 --> 15:02.200
with Japanese convention

15:02.760 --> 15:04.360
but I believe it's still part

15:05.400 --> 15:06.600
of Japanese culture.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.960
I created this Lamborghini

15:15.560 --> 15:17.240
for the night.

15:17.320 --> 15:20.320
I combined <i>Star Wars</i>

15:20.960 --> 15:25.760
with the unique style
of Japanese biker gangs.

15:32.640 --> 15:36.720
Tokyo's Shuto Expressway
is like a one-of-a-kind racetrack

15:36.800 --> 15:40.040
that runs between buildings.

15:43.160 --> 15:45.920
Driving into a tunnel at night

15:46.480 --> 15:48.760
really feels like I'm in my own world.

15:49.840 --> 15:54.960
I speed past with a boom
and amazing coolness.

15:59.920 --> 16:02.440
In Japanese, there's a word, <i>ikigai</i>.

16:03.440 --> 16:06.120
It's something that satisfies

16:06.200 --> 16:08.840
and fulfills your life.

16:09.960 --> 16:14.680
I'd say mine is to drive
the Lamborghinis I love.

16:36.160 --> 16:38.800
After sundown in Tokyo's backstreets,

16:38.880 --> 16:41.560
lights go on under the eaves of <i>izakaya</i>.

16:41.640 --> 16:44.480
<i>Izakaya</i> are casual establishments

16:44.560 --> 16:47.040
that serve both food and alcohol.

17:00.080 --> 17:01.520
Can I have some sake?

17:01.600 --> 17:03.760
Sure thing. Pour Luke
some sake from the bamboo.

17:04.960 --> 17:06.640
You all need to drink more.

17:06.720 --> 17:08.080
Or I'll go broke.

17:10.839 --> 17:14.160
Many are small and individually run

17:14.240 --> 17:17.000
where the owner decides everything

17:17.079 --> 17:20.400
from the food and drink
to the interior design.

17:20.480 --> 17:22.599
The place is like his castle.

17:23.480 --> 17:26.599
Narukiyo Izakaya is a great example.

17:28.079 --> 17:29.839
Okay, for table two.

17:30.760 --> 17:33.720
Eating out at night in Tokyo

17:35.240 --> 17:36.600
is about meeting people

17:36.680 --> 17:38.200
and connecting with them.

17:39.720 --> 17:40.840
Welcome.

17:42.120 --> 17:44.440
I'm Narukiyo Yoshida,

17:44.520 --> 17:45.840
owner of Narukiyo.

17:45.920 --> 17:47.440
NARUKIYO

17:48.320 --> 17:50.600
I opened for business 16 years ago.

17:51.680 --> 17:54.800
It's a standing bar,
but I wanted to make it like a restaurant.

17:55.840 --> 17:56.680
At the start,

17:56.760 --> 17:59.320
I had real wood tables
and fussed over the plates.

17:59.880 --> 18:03.720
But I soon ran out of funds for chairs.

18:05.080 --> 18:08.360
So I ended up making it a standing bar.

18:10.080 --> 18:11.080
At first,

18:11.160 --> 18:13.720
no one in Tokyo would stand

18:14.800 --> 18:16.960
but thankfully,

18:17.520 --> 18:19.080
the standing bar boom happened.

18:22.120 --> 18:24.080
I wanted to go into fashion.

18:24.160 --> 18:26.920
I wanted to study French
and be a designer.

18:27.720 --> 18:31.240
But my family ran a restaurant.

18:32.080 --> 18:35.400
I was the only son,
so they told me to take it over.

18:38.960 --> 18:39.800
One day,

18:39.880 --> 18:42.880
my grandmother told me
something I made was really tasty

18:42.960 --> 18:44.960
and I thought,

18:45.800 --> 18:47.680
"This is a good profession."

18:50.200 --> 18:51.320
This is beef stew.

18:51.400 --> 18:52.480
How do I make it?

18:53.640 --> 18:54.560
I boil it.

18:57.520 --> 18:58.880
I made a place

18:58.960 --> 19:01.120
I'd like to visit as a customer.

19:02.680 --> 19:06.040
We love eating out.

19:06.120 --> 19:08.600
This place is rather special.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.760
It's like nowhere else.

19:13.040 --> 19:14.480
Horse heart.

19:16.040 --> 19:19.120
The great thing about a horse's heart is

19:19.760 --> 19:21.240
it makes your dick stand up.

19:23.880 --> 19:25.680
I'm always giving comments like this.

19:27.280 --> 19:29.120
I can only say stuff like this.

19:32.600 --> 19:34.760
This is a drinking joint,

19:36.240 --> 19:37.920
so there is always a hint of sex.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.240
These are penises.

19:51.040 --> 19:53.040
I've never bought any of these.

19:56.320 --> 20:00.080
I love chatting as I eat.
It's live entertainment.

20:02.560 --> 20:05.240
The boss is really funny
and the food is great.

20:05.800 --> 20:07.080
I want to come all the time.

20:08.720 --> 20:11.560
She's in love with me.
Next to her boyfriend.

20:15.840 --> 20:18.440
I'm not so interested in profit.

20:20.360 --> 20:22.600
What I hope every day is

20:23.160 --> 20:25.240
for people to come to enjoy themselves.

20:25.320 --> 20:26.440
Come on, everybody!

20:36.920 --> 20:41.080
They don't call Shinjuku beautiful

20:41.160 --> 20:42.760
but I like it.

20:49.840 --> 20:52.920
The buildings are taller now,

20:53.400 --> 20:57.680
but I don't think it's changed that much.

21:06.360 --> 21:07.280
Hello.

21:07.360 --> 21:09.360
-Hello.
-Hello

21:09.920 --> 21:12.000
-Are you playing today?
-Yes, I am.

21:12.080 --> 21:14.600
-I'm looking forward to it.
-Let's make it a good night!

21:15.280 --> 21:18.400
-That's cute. I can see your boobs.
-Thanks.

21:19.720 --> 21:22.800
That's see-through too. So cute.

21:22.880 --> 21:25.080
It's super sexy. And sparkly.

21:25.160 --> 21:28.040
Her outfits are out there

21:28.120 --> 21:30.920
and she chooses songs
that make people dance,

21:31.000 --> 21:33.160
so she's amazing and super cool.

21:36.360 --> 21:38.440
People around my age

21:38.520 --> 21:41.320
don't really know what a DJ is.

21:43.360 --> 21:45.920
They say, "You do this?"

21:46.000 --> 21:48.680
But they don't even know what that means.

21:53.440 --> 21:55.920
Today's crowd will want

21:56.000 --> 21:58.800
to show off their loud fashion

21:58.880 --> 22:01.480
like colorful wigs or lots of piercings.

22:01.560 --> 22:03.800
It's easier for them
to gather at an event.

22:04.600 --> 22:06.880
To dance and let off steam.

22:10.760 --> 22:13.320
I'm a little bit anxious.

22:14.000 --> 22:18.440
I tap this once to play music.

22:18.520 --> 22:23.560
Sometimes I'm scared and tap twice.
That means stop already.

22:24.760 --> 22:28.720
That happened maybe
two or three times before.

22:30.440 --> 22:35.400
I'm going to play techno
and some old Japanese songs.

22:36.520 --> 22:42.360
I hope they will understand my,
you know, idea.

22:44.840 --> 22:46.760
Maybe they'll wonder

22:46.840 --> 22:50.760
why this old woman is here.

23:06.200 --> 23:08.680
Tokyo at night is a time for adventures.

23:09.320 --> 23:10.680
After dark,

23:10.760 --> 23:13.240
there's a sense
of possibility and playfulness.

23:20.640 --> 23:23.800
Twillo is a traveling bar
that comes in the shape of a street stall.

23:24.280 --> 23:26.800
It offers up some escapism

23:26.880 --> 23:29.760
to help people regain their sense of fun.

23:33.720 --> 23:35.680
My name is Shotaro Kamijo.

23:38.080 --> 23:40.080
Tokyo is a huge city

23:40.880 --> 23:45.560
and there are a lot of people living here.

23:48.520 --> 23:51.040
I go around

23:51.520 --> 23:53.800
gathering people in different places

23:55.360 --> 23:57.240
to connect all sorts of people together.

23:59.240 --> 24:04.160
Late night in a metropolis is when
everyone's loneliness merges together.

24:09.040 --> 24:13.520
Some places are very lively
and others are quiet.

24:14.640 --> 24:17.280
I've been to this spot before

24:18.360 --> 24:20.320
and it's one of my favorites.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.520
It's called Mannenbashi.

24:25.640 --> 24:28.840
Twillo doesn't have anything.

24:28.920 --> 24:31.760
No set location

24:32.360 --> 24:34.120
and no drinks menu.

24:34.680 --> 24:36.480
Also, no set prices.

24:37.520 --> 24:42.000
When I started, people made fun of me.

24:42.080 --> 24:44.160
They said I wouldn't last three months.

24:45.600 --> 24:49.160
I used to work as an aide

24:49.640 --> 24:51.760
in the House of Representatives.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.080
But I quit.

24:54.160 --> 24:57.280
I wanted to rely on just myself.

24:58.160 --> 25:01.160
It feels like I'm doing that now.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.880
I always post my location
on Twitter and Facebook.

25:10.080 --> 25:13.760
"I'm at Higashi-ginza,
across from the Kabukiza Theatre."

25:14.240 --> 25:18.800
"Tonight, I'll relax here with my cigar."

25:25.800 --> 25:27.080
I'm set,

25:28.320 --> 25:30.400
so will just wait for customers to arrive.

25:48.440 --> 25:51.480
A lot of different folks
come here one by one.

25:54.520 --> 25:55.640
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

25:56.280 --> 25:58.240
We have two drinks today.

25:58.840 --> 26:01.440
This is the calvados.

26:01.520 --> 26:02.880
It's an apple brandy.

26:03.640 --> 26:06.160
This is 23-year-old rum.

26:06.240 --> 26:07.560
The calvados, please.

26:07.640 --> 26:08.480
Calvados.

26:09.280 --> 26:13.800
It's been 13 and a half years
since I started.

26:14.760 --> 26:18.880
I have about 14,000 Twitter followers now.

26:18.960 --> 26:20.160
Good evening.

26:20.240 --> 26:21.880
-May I?
-Go ahead.

26:24.400 --> 26:27.920
This is my 3,303rd night.

26:28.480 --> 26:29.960
There you go.

26:30.040 --> 26:31.800
Thank you very much.

26:34.280 --> 26:39.160
Every night is different,
from the location to the people.

26:41.360 --> 26:42.760
Every night is special.

26:44.280 --> 26:46.080
It's great how it shakes.

26:46.160 --> 26:48.080
Yes, this bridge shakes.

26:49.280 --> 26:51.080
Especially when a big truck goes over it.

26:53.160 --> 26:55.680
He puts his location up on Twitter

26:56.240 --> 26:57.760
so I use that to find him,

26:57.840 --> 26:58.840
like a treasure hunt.

27:01.240 --> 27:04.360
Tokyo has many adventures on offer,

27:04.840 --> 27:09.800
but it feels like I'm guided here.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.800
It's like a small boat

27:15.880 --> 27:18.720
that everyone happens to be aboard.

27:19.520 --> 27:22.040
The thought that I made all this happen

27:22.960 --> 27:24.160
makes me

27:24.760 --> 27:26.400
happy.

27:38.400 --> 27:42.960
Japanese society
is said to have strict rules,

27:43.040 --> 27:48.560
but the tricky thing is that
these rules aren't clearly defined.

27:48.640 --> 27:51.880
Activities that disturb others
are generally seen as a nuisance.

27:51.960 --> 27:53.520
But at night,

27:53.600 --> 27:55.880
things are a little more free

27:55.960 --> 27:58.520
and forgiving towards activities

27:58.600 --> 28:00.000
normally prohibited by day.

28:00.080 --> 28:01.960
NO SKATEBOARDING

28:02.600 --> 28:03.480
Let's do this.

28:37.120 --> 28:39.520
Tokyo has a daytime face

28:40.040 --> 28:41.280
and a nighttime face.

28:42.400 --> 28:44.720
In the day,

28:44.800 --> 28:49.200
there are so many rules and burdens
that you'll explode.

28:53.960 --> 28:55.280
It's thanks to the night

28:55.760 --> 29:00.560
that many people can show
their passions and true selves.

29:03.960 --> 29:07.960
<i>Welcome, everyone.</i>

29:11.920 --> 29:13.400
Department H

29:13.480 --> 29:16.880
is Japan's oldest fetish party.

29:18.680 --> 29:21.360
In Japan, there are private lives
and public fronts.

29:21.440 --> 29:23.920
An executive

29:24.000 --> 29:26.080
at a huge company

29:26.160 --> 29:28.320
might come to Department H

29:28.400 --> 29:31.160
and end up naked on all fours.

29:32.840 --> 29:35.080
We don't pry into the lives

29:35.160 --> 29:37.120
of our clientele

29:37.200 --> 29:40.240
so I think it creates a free space.

29:40.320 --> 29:42.240
RUBBER BOOTH
NO PHOTOGRAPHS

29:42.320 --> 29:44.640
I like how I can freely enjoy

29:44.720 --> 29:47.600
wearing rubber.

29:47.680 --> 29:49.400
I've been coming

29:49.880 --> 29:52.120
for over 25 years.

29:52.200 --> 29:53.880
I'm a wine sommelier

29:53.960 --> 29:55.440
and it's quite a rigid job.

30:01.240 --> 30:02.320
It might look

30:02.400 --> 30:04.480
a little weird from the outside

30:05.080 --> 30:08.000
but everybody has a little weird in them.

30:09.240 --> 30:12.280
If people have the courage to join in

30:12.360 --> 30:14.240
we can all have fun together.

30:16.760 --> 30:19.440
There aren't many places in Japan

30:19.520 --> 30:21.520
that host these shows

30:21.600 --> 30:23.400
but that's the reason that

30:23.880 --> 30:26.240
the people of the night
want these performances.

30:27.800 --> 30:30.800
This is my first ever performance
at Department H.

30:31.480 --> 30:36.480
I used to work in an office.
But I didn't stay long.

30:44.800 --> 30:47.920
It's thanks to the world at night

30:48.480 --> 30:51.400
that I can keep working hard

30:51.960 --> 30:54.480
during the day.

31:21.240 --> 31:24.560
When I get attention

31:25.080 --> 31:29.160
or get told I'm amazing

31:29.720 --> 31:33.840
I half-suspect it's because of my age.

31:34.440 --> 31:35.600
That's sexy.

31:35.680 --> 31:36.960
It's super see-through.

31:37.040 --> 31:39.280
Just like the boss.

31:39.360 --> 31:41.280
I want them to say I'm good,

31:41.360 --> 31:43.280
regardless of my age.

31:55.920 --> 31:58.040
I have always been a night person.

31:59.320 --> 32:00.840
My mother said

32:00.920 --> 32:02.760
I'd open my eyes at night

32:03.400 --> 32:06.520
and just lie there, wide awake.

32:10.880 --> 32:13.840
Give me some more energy!

32:15.920 --> 32:19.920
It's the best seeing them dance.

32:31.440 --> 32:34.120
Working the CDJ

32:34.200 --> 32:36.480
is a lot like fry cooking.

32:37.120 --> 32:38.440
And you get a quick result.

32:39.680 --> 32:42.440
If it's good, they dance.

32:42.520 --> 32:46.240
So you can tell straight away.

32:49.960 --> 32:52.600
DJ Sumirock's vitality and passion

32:52.680 --> 32:55.880
reflect a wonderful part
of Tokyo's nightlife.

32:56.360 --> 32:58.360
The darkness blurs boundaries

32:58.440 --> 33:01.440
and people of different ages and tastes

33:01.520 --> 33:05.200
often enjoy themselves in the same spaces.

33:11.600 --> 33:14.280
What I love about Sumirock

33:14.360 --> 33:16.920
is her energy.

33:18.360 --> 33:20.800
She has vigor and is always smiling.

33:20.880 --> 33:23.240
I respect her.

33:25.240 --> 33:27.360
-Sumirock has a great sound!
-Sumirock has a great sound!

33:33.320 --> 33:35.720
My dad passed away quite young,

33:36.200 --> 33:37.800
but if he were alive

33:37.880 --> 33:40.040
and saw me DJing,

33:40.120 --> 33:43.360
I'm sure he'd be happy.

33:43.440 --> 33:48.760
Big applause for DJ Sumirock!

34:03.480 --> 34:05.760
The night in Tokyo is a special time.

34:06.400 --> 34:09.800
The imagination, diversity,

34:09.880 --> 34:11.680
and creativity of its vibrant population

34:11.760 --> 34:13.600
truly show themselves

34:13.679 --> 34:15.800
and make the city like nowhere else

34:15.880 --> 34:17.440
on Earth.

34:20.159 --> 34:22.600
The day is when everyone works

34:23.239 --> 34:25.000
and the night is when everyone plays.

34:25.080 --> 34:26.600
That's my image of Tokyo.

34:29.639 --> 34:32.280
Yes, I had lots of fun today.

34:33.600 --> 34:36.040
I've lived

34:36.520 --> 34:38.320
through countless nights

34:39.520 --> 34:41.920
but the ones I DJ are special.

35:00.080 --> 35:03.800
Tokyo is a huge city

35:04.360 --> 35:05.800
that has everything.

35:05.880 --> 35:09.160
But there are all sorts of places,
and if you dive down,

35:09.240 --> 35:11.000
it goes very deep.
