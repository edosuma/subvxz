02:57.808 --> 03:00.143
Will!

03:00.144 --> 03:01.911
Henry!

03:16.994 --> 03:19.328
The abnormals.

06:36.626 --> 06:37.560
Aah!

07:16.267 --> 07:17.400
What the hell is going on?

07:23.240 --> 07:25.574
No!

08:50.461 --> 08:52.695
More fun and games?

08:52.696 --> 08:56.065
Don't move.

08:58.502 --> 08:59.568
Will?

08:59.569 --> 09:01.837
I said, "don't move!"

09:01.838 --> 09:03.539
What the hell is going on?

09:03.540 --> 09:04.773
What the hell happened to you?

09:05.876 --> 09:07.243
Who are you?

09:09.380 --> 09:10.446
Will, it's me...

09:10.447 --> 09:11.314
Your name!

09:11.315 --> 09:14.617
Helen. Magnus.

09:16.653 --> 09:19.088
Satisfied?

09:19.089 --> 09:20.223
I don't think so.

09:21.525 --> 09:26.262
Helen Magnus died three years ago.

09:39.227 --> 09:40.828
Answer my question.

09:42.331 --> 09:43.431
Will...

09:43.432 --> 09:44.365
Who are you?!

09:44.366 --> 09:46.701
I told you! I'm Helen Mag...

09:46.702 --> 09:49.370
Let go of me! Let go of me!

09:49.371 --> 09:51.872
Say it again. Say it again...

09:51.873 --> 09:53.641
You expect to just show up here

09:53.642 --> 09:54.975
after three years dead

09:54.976 --> 09:56.877
and think we're just going to make nice?

09:56.878 --> 09:58.346
No way.

09:58.347 --> 09:59.547
You want me to believe this,

09:59.548 --> 10:01.048
make it good!

10:18.867 --> 10:20.534
You see, if you'd done your homework,

10:20.535 --> 10:21.602
you'd know.

10:21.603 --> 10:23.070
The real Helen Magnus died

10:23.071 --> 10:24.905
in the battle for Buenos Aires.

10:24.906 --> 10:26.106
What?

10:26.107 --> 10:27.841
And you'd have a good
spin on how she survived.

10:27.842 --> 10:30.678
Right now, you got neither.

10:30.679 --> 10:32.012
I don't remember any battle.

10:32.013 --> 10:33.748
How does this work?

10:33.749 --> 10:36.684
Are you a chameleon? A shape-shifter?

10:36.685 --> 10:38.786
How did you get this far
into the red zone by yourself?

10:38.787 --> 10:40.621
- I am not an impostor!
- How?

10:41.690 --> 10:43.023
I work up in the Sanctuary!

10:44.559 --> 10:46.059
We don't call it that anymore.

10:47.663 --> 10:48.929
I found myself here.

10:48.930 --> 10:50.498
You a telepath?

10:50.499 --> 10:51.932
Is that it?

10:51.933 --> 10:54.435
That's how you know my name.

10:54.436 --> 10:55.603
Will, this is insane...

10:55.604 --> 10:57.505
Prepare one hit, medium voltage.

10:57.506 --> 10:59.373
This mind-reading crap won't fly.

10:59.374 --> 11:00.174
No.

11:00.175 --> 11:02.009
Helen Magnus is dead!

11:07.015 --> 11:09.850
Incoming!

11:11.553 --> 11:12.520
We have a breach.

11:12.521 --> 11:15.923
Go! Secure the perimeter!

11:15.924 --> 11:17.090
Did you summon them?

11:17.091 --> 11:18.392
What? No!

11:18.393 --> 11:19.460
Did you?

11:21.996 --> 11:24.699
You better pray this goes well.

11:33.442 --> 11:35.476
Grenade!

11:51.393 --> 11:53.427
One hit on my mark. Cover me.

12:16.685 --> 12:17.651
Damn it Jason!

12:17.652 --> 12:19.052
You trying to be a hero again?!

12:25.660 --> 12:26.727
No, he's got time, will!

12:27.696 --> 12:28.596
No!

12:28.597 --> 12:29.530
Come on, we can use him!

12:31.065 --> 12:34.668
Sorry, Jason.

12:37.639 --> 12:40.140
Pack up the supplies.

12:41.877 --> 12:43.243
We're heading out.

12:53.688 --> 12:56.657
She's armed.

13:38.232 --> 13:39.266
Die!

13:41.770 --> 13:43.671
Please don't kill me!

13:56.950 --> 13:58.984
I'm Helen.

14:00.620 --> 14:01.720
Proper etiquette would be

14:01.721 --> 14:04.890
to offer your name in return.

14:15.769 --> 14:17.335
I've rigged up some perimeter alarms.

14:17.336 --> 14:18.503
Quite rudimentary,

14:18.504 --> 14:19.638
but they should give us ample warning

14:19.639 --> 14:22.708
if we have any visitors.

14:24.944 --> 14:26.611
I'll see what else I can find.

14:29.049 --> 14:30.749
Jessica.

14:32.819 --> 14:34.953
Mitchell.

14:38.925 --> 14:42.795
What were you doing
down there by yourself...

14:42.796 --> 14:44.830
Jessica Mitchell?

14:44.831 --> 14:46.665
What were you doing down there?

14:49.402 --> 14:51.704
Shelter, mainly.

14:51.705 --> 14:53.872
I suppose I was looking for something

14:53.873 --> 14:55.540
to help me understand all of this.

14:55.541 --> 14:57.109
There's nothing out there but them.

14:58.745 --> 15:00.045
Your parents, are they...

15:07.587 --> 15:09.021
Sorry.

15:12.525 --> 15:15.127
How long have you been on your own?

15:15.128 --> 15:16.729
I don't know.

15:16.730 --> 15:20.132
It's easier to keep moving
when you're by yourself.

15:23.937 --> 15:25.670
Try and get some rest.

15:25.671 --> 15:28.673
I'll be close by.

15:38.484 --> 15:41.887
They'll find us, you know.

15:41.888 --> 15:43.822
They always do.

15:43.823 --> 15:44.990
We shouldn't stay here.

15:46.626 --> 15:50.629
Where else should we go?

16:25.765 --> 16:28.700
The outbreak is spreading
at an alarming rate.

16:28.701 --> 16:30.735
We cannot contain the impact.

16:33.072 --> 16:35.607
The city is now evacuated.

16:35.608 --> 16:39.044
Our last stand is to
hold on to the Sanctuary.

16:45.218 --> 16:46.985
Hearing this,

16:46.986 --> 16:48.653
we will abandon the last Sanctuary.

16:48.654 --> 16:50.488
All efforts to find
a cure for this plague

16:50.489 --> 16:51.656
have failed.

16:53.092 --> 16:55.160
Our only hope is to find safe ground

16:55.161 --> 16:58.263
to protect what few of us remain.

17:00.200 --> 17:03.101
I'm sorry for everything.

17:07.707 --> 17:10.608
Dear God.

17:39.906 --> 17:41.340
Don't move!

17:45.144 --> 17:46.278
Relax.

17:46.279 --> 17:47.946
I'm not here to start anything.

17:47.947 --> 17:49.814
What the hell are you doing here?

17:49.815 --> 17:51.049
Bleeding.

17:53.353 --> 17:54.652
What happened?

17:59.292 --> 18:01.126
What do you think?

18:02.862 --> 18:04.296
More palefaces,

18:04.297 --> 18:06.765
but this time I'm the
only one who made it out.

18:09.035 --> 18:10.168
How did you get in here?

18:10.169 --> 18:11.370
I checked every access point.

18:11.371 --> 18:13.238
I broke in

18:13.239 --> 18:14.572
through the old river gate,

18:14.573 --> 18:17.109
But don't worry, I locked it behind me.

18:17.110 --> 18:18.810
Ah!

18:21.614 --> 18:24.082
It's just shrapnel.

18:24.083 --> 18:25.117
You can patch it up later.

18:25.118 --> 18:27.819
Why should I,

18:27.820 --> 18:30.022
after the reception you gave me?

18:37.931 --> 18:39.031
Come on.

18:40.166 --> 18:41.934
Let's get you sorted.

18:50.043 --> 18:51.143
Scare you?

18:51.144 --> 18:53.011
Only when I saw your face.

18:53.012 --> 18:56.181
Behave, both of you.

18:56.182 --> 18:59.217
It may be a shambles, but
this is still my house.

19:06.692 --> 19:07.960
What?

19:13.299 --> 19:17.936
Three years ago...

19:17.937 --> 19:21.239
The air force dropped a daisy cutter

19:21.240 --> 19:22.807
on an Argentine neighborhood

19:22.808 --> 19:24.309
that you were trying to evacuate.

19:28.781 --> 19:33.952
15,000 people were vaporized,

19:33.953 --> 19:36.788
including you, at ground zero,

19:36.789 --> 19:40.292
and suddenly, here you are,

19:40.293 --> 19:44.296
alive and well.

19:46.932 --> 19:49.868
You were gone, Magnus,

19:49.869 --> 19:51.069
without a trace...

19:51.070 --> 19:52.437
I can't explain it.

19:52.438 --> 19:54.172
- Try.
- I don't know.

19:54.173 --> 19:56.908
I... I woke up here with
no memory of anything,

19:56.909 --> 19:58.377
I mean, you, those creatures.

19:58.378 --> 20:00.078
Buenos Aires? I...

20:03.849 --> 20:06.218
Well, you look good.

20:09.122 --> 20:10.389
You must have been holed up

20:10.390 --> 20:11.956
somewhere real sweet.

20:11.957 --> 20:14.993
You look like you've had...

20:14.994 --> 20:16.995
Food,

20:16.996 --> 20:18.796
shelter,

20:18.797 --> 20:20.432
sunlight.

20:20.433 --> 20:23.335
Was there a colony

20:23.336 --> 20:25.003
that I didn't know about?

20:25.004 --> 20:26.471
The last thing I recall...

20:27.806 --> 20:29.007
Was what?

20:29.008 --> 20:30.475
A mission.

20:30.476 --> 20:31.809
Central America.

20:31.810 --> 20:33.778
I...

20:33.779 --> 20:35.447
Why can't I remember
anything since then?

20:35.448 --> 20:37.215
It's like this is all a dream.

20:43.456 --> 20:45.190
Everything is gone.

20:47.026 --> 20:48.927
Everything we built,

20:48.928 --> 20:50.095
gone.

20:51.730 --> 20:53.998
Everyone we ever cared about is dead!

20:56.369 --> 20:58.770
Does this look like a dream?

21:00.506 --> 21:02.340
What happened to you, Will?

21:10.916 --> 21:12.150
It was more than just a plague.

21:12.151 --> 21:14.152
It was a new kind of species...

21:14.153 --> 21:15.820
Cannibalistic,

21:15.821 --> 21:19.291
mindless, soulless.

21:19.292 --> 21:22.160
At first we tried
containment, treatment.

21:22.161 --> 21:24.929
We wanted to understand.

21:24.930 --> 21:26.931
But it wasn't natural evolution.

21:26.932 --> 21:28.166
Rampant infection rates.

21:28.167 --> 21:29.468
Quick mutation.

21:29.469 --> 21:33.972
Within a year, millions had turned.

21:33.973 --> 21:37.109
It affected both humans and abnormals.

21:37.110 --> 21:40.044
There were too many to fight.

21:40.045 --> 21:41.446
Too powerful.

21:41.447 --> 21:44.249
They fed on anything alive,

21:44.250 --> 21:48.019
and if they drew blood, if
you survived the attack...

21:48.020 --> 21:49.454
You changed.

21:49.455 --> 21:50.589
Five, six hours,

21:50.590 --> 21:53.358
a day max,

21:53.359 --> 21:54.826
and you were one of them,

21:54.827 --> 21:55.960
infected.

21:55.961 --> 21:57.429
We never found the point of origin?

21:57.430 --> 21:59.831
But there had to have
been a patient zero.

21:59.832 --> 22:04.402
The infection spread too
suickly to find the source.

22:04.403 --> 22:07.372
We did everything we could to slow it.

22:07.373 --> 22:09.608
Nothing worked.

22:09.609 --> 22:10.875
After a while,

22:10.876 --> 22:13.011
you were euthanizing
more than you treated.

22:15.314 --> 22:16.948
Governments evacuated cities.

22:16.949 --> 22:18.450
We abandoned the Sanctuaries.

22:20.219 --> 22:23.622
That global panic thing,

22:23.623 --> 22:25.457
it's a bitch, let me tell you.

22:27.092 --> 22:29.127
Then they started
deploying tactical nukes.

22:32.131 --> 22:33.931
How many are left?

22:35.535 --> 22:38.002
Uninfected?

22:38.003 --> 22:43.542
100,000 worldwide, maybe.

22:43.543 --> 22:46.444
I set up a colony in the arctic.

22:46.445 --> 22:49.181
There's a few thousand
living on remote islands.

22:49.182 --> 22:51.616
We've been fighting these creatures.

22:51.617 --> 22:53.918
We're part of a larger militia,

22:53.919 --> 22:55.487
but...

22:57.122 --> 22:59.524
But we've been whittled down one by one

22:59.525 --> 23:02.126
just trying to save
the last of the last.

23:05.931 --> 23:08.633
It's over.

23:08.634 --> 23:10.235
It has been for a long time.

23:12.572 --> 23:16.575
Why can't I remember any of this?

23:16.576 --> 23:19.977
You must've got out somehow,

23:19.978 --> 23:21.580
been in a colony

23:21.581 --> 23:23.481
suffering from amnesia,

23:23.482 --> 23:24.583
battle shock...

23:24.584 --> 23:26.951
No. No, that's not it.

23:26.952 --> 23:31.389
There is a reason I came back here now.

23:31.390 --> 23:33.391
Helen?

23:33.392 --> 23:34.492
I don't feel so...

23:35.528 --> 23:36.628
Quick,
Will--

23:36.629 --> 23:37.662
Don't touch her!

23:38.931 --> 23:40.498
She's infected. You didn't check her?

23:40.499 --> 23:42.133
I didn't know!

23:42.134 --> 23:42.601
Will!

23:44.437 --> 23:45.537
She's dead already.

23:45.538 --> 23:46.705
You said we have five hours,

23:46.706 --> 23:48.106
maybe more.

23:48.107 --> 23:49.374
Please, help me understand this.

23:49.375 --> 23:50.642
Magnus, if she turns, they'll come.

23:50.643 --> 23:52.611
Then I suggest you leave,

23:52.612 --> 23:54.446
because I will not let
you shoot this girl.

24:48.934 --> 24:51.235
Unfortunately, the elixir from the vial

24:51.236 --> 24:52.904
seems to have had no effect on me

24:52.905 --> 24:54.939
except a spike in my
immunoglobulin levels.

24:54.940 --> 24:57.408
Repeated attempts to bring
them back down into normal range

24:57.409 --> 24:58.576
have failed.

24:58.577 --> 25:00.077
This is all a very bad idea.

25:01.647 --> 25:03.247
Which means you really must be you.

25:06.552 --> 25:07.652
Why did you come here?

25:07.653 --> 25:09.921
So you could retrace ground

25:09.922 --> 25:11.623
you've already covered?

25:12.958 --> 25:14.258
I don't have the right equipment

25:14.259 --> 25:16.027
to run the proper blood tests,

25:16.028 --> 25:17.161
but I should be able to aross-reference

25:17.162 --> 25:18.663
Jessica's symptoms

25:18.664 --> 25:20.565
with entries from my previous research,

25:20.566 --> 25:21.633
look for some sort of deviation.

25:23.135 --> 25:25.937
Deviations?

25:25.938 --> 25:28.239
They've become the dominant
species on the planet.

25:28.240 --> 25:29.674
They're like locusts...

25:29.675 --> 25:31.375
that turn other life
forms into more locusts.

25:31.376 --> 25:33.210
But the contagion had to
have started somewhere.

25:33.211 --> 25:34.311
Someone must have been
the first to contract it.

25:34.312 --> 25:36.648
Let's do the time warp again...

25:36.649 --> 25:39.083
Typhus, smallpox, cholera, yellow fever,

25:39.084 --> 25:40.518
scarlet fever, malaria...

25:40.519 --> 25:41.953
They all bear no
relation to this disease.

25:41.954 --> 25:43.555
Have you caught up yet?

25:43.556 --> 25:45.089
There has to be evidence of this disease

25:45.090 --> 25:46.424
somewhere in the past.

25:46.425 --> 25:47.391
It cannot have aome out of nowhere.

25:47.392 --> 25:49.293
We've done this dance.

25:49.294 --> 25:51.696
You've tried cures,
treatments, for years.

25:51.697 --> 25:52.964
Nothing works.

25:52.965 --> 25:53.965
The contagion mutates.

25:53.966 --> 25:55.266
It wins.

25:55.267 --> 25:57.569
Humans are extinct.

25:57.570 --> 25:59.336
We're not.

25:59.337 --> 26:00.504
You and me, we're alive.

26:00.505 --> 26:02.139
Isn't that a reason for hope?

26:02.140 --> 26:03.407
Reason?

26:03.408 --> 26:05.376
There isn't a reason
for anything anymore.

26:05.377 --> 26:06.678
We know how we're dying,

26:06.679 --> 26:08.179
but why it's happening,

26:08.180 --> 26:09.581
what we did to deserve this,

26:09.582 --> 26:10.448
who the hell knows?

26:10.449 --> 26:12.383
This doesn't make any sense.

26:12.384 --> 26:13.517
There has to be a way to stop it...

26:13.518 --> 26:16.420
You've already done this!

26:16.421 --> 26:17.622
You tried

26:17.623 --> 26:18.923
every single waking moment

26:18.924 --> 26:20.224
until the very end.

26:20.225 --> 26:21.960
You kept going.

26:21.961 --> 26:23.061
You're still fighting.

26:26.498 --> 26:29.968
Life without purpose isn't...

26:29.969 --> 26:32.169
Life.

26:35.207 --> 26:37.041
I learned that from you.

26:39.578 --> 26:41.545
I'm sorry I disappeared.

26:44.717 --> 26:46.183
Company's here.

26:46.184 --> 26:48.219
I'll go head them off
at the access tunnels.

26:49.454 --> 26:51.990
You might want to go protect the girl.

28:32.124 --> 28:33.524
Henry...

28:48.741 --> 28:50.407
Couple of storerooms on the garage level

28:50.408 --> 28:52.509
I missed when we evacuated,

28:52.510 --> 28:55.146
though we were in kind of a rush.

28:55.147 --> 28:57.115
I rigged this up with
one of our one-hits.

28:57.116 --> 28:58.482
Should keep you in
computerland for a while.

28:58.483 --> 29:00.351
Oh, and I hate to break it to you,

29:00.352 --> 29:01.585
but the Internet's down.

29:01.586 --> 29:03.554
Has been for about five years.

29:03.555 --> 29:05.322
I'll survive.

29:06.524 --> 29:07.691
More of them will be coming.

29:07.692 --> 29:09.827
Defenses?

29:09.828 --> 29:11.695
Nonexistent.

29:11.696 --> 29:13.297
It's just me and you

29:13.298 --> 29:15.599
against thousands of inhuman cannibals.

29:15.600 --> 29:17.401
Well, then we should be fine.

29:19.471 --> 29:20.738
There was a time

29:20.739 --> 29:22.206
you would have laughed at that.

29:22.207 --> 29:25.209
Yeah, I'm sure there was.

29:25.210 --> 29:26.811
Central America.

29:26.812 --> 29:28.246
Is that where the outbreak started?

29:28.247 --> 29:29.847
Could that have been ground zero

29:29.848 --> 29:31.215
for the contagion?

29:31.216 --> 29:32.750
No...

29:32.751 --> 29:34.852
I think all evidence pointed
to the Pacific Northwest.

29:34.853 --> 29:35.820
Why?

29:35.821 --> 29:38.622
Honduras. It figures into this somehow.

29:38.623 --> 29:40.457
Why?

29:40.458 --> 29:41.492
I... I don't know.

29:41.493 --> 29:42.559
I have to access my personal log,

29:42.560 --> 29:43.661
but there's something there important

29:43.662 --> 29:44.762
that I'm missing.

29:44.763 --> 29:49.300
I'll be damned if I know what it is.

29:49.301 --> 29:51.635
Magnus, what are you
doing with this girl?

29:51.636 --> 29:53.171
I have a theory I'd like to test.

29:53.172 --> 29:54.738
I found some anticoagulants
and older blood thinners

29:54.739 --> 29:55.807
in the storeroom.

29:55.808 --> 29:57.208
The old
dialysis-on-the-fly trick.

29:57.209 --> 29:58.475
Yeah, I've been there, done that.

29:58.476 --> 29:59.643
I know. I saw the notes,

29:59.644 --> 30:00.778
but we've also never had

30:00.779 --> 30:02.413
such an early jump on the infection.

30:02.414 --> 30:04.648
All the other test subjects
were either long infected

30:04.649 --> 30:05.917
or completely turned.

30:05.918 --> 30:07.451
Jessica's only been showing symptoms

30:07.452 --> 30:08.853
for less than a couple of hours.

30:08.854 --> 30:09.887
It's much earlier

30:09.888 --> 30:11.655
in the transformation process.

30:11.656 --> 30:13.524
Bring on the Hail Mary.

30:13.525 --> 30:15.293
Mmm.

30:18.230 --> 30:19.596
Will...

30:22.835 --> 30:24.768
The others?

30:29.274 --> 30:30.641
Henry...

30:30.642 --> 30:33.377
Made weapons for the government

30:33.378 --> 30:37.348
until it finally fell.

30:37.349 --> 30:40.651
He kept finding newer,
better ways to stop them,

30:40.652 --> 30:41.953
to kill them,

30:41.954 --> 30:43.454
then his number finally came up.

30:43.455 --> 30:46.523
I saw the photos.

30:46.524 --> 30:47.825
The big guy refused to leave

30:47.826 --> 30:50.427
after we pulled up stakes,

30:50.428 --> 30:53.497
even though there was
nothing here left to protect.

30:53.498 --> 30:54.698
I'm guessing he took
more than a few with him

30:54.699 --> 30:56.200
when he finally went.

30:56.201 --> 30:57.268
And Kate?

30:59.471 --> 31:00.637
She died...

31:02.941 --> 31:04.842
In the fighting.

31:04.843 --> 31:07.444
She was a good fighter,

31:07.445 --> 31:09.780
a good leader.

31:12.384 --> 31:13.918
Druitt...

31:15.988 --> 31:18.289
He took a tactical nuke

31:18.290 --> 31:19.590
and teleported into the middle

31:19.591 --> 31:22.659
of a high-density infection area.

31:22.660 --> 31:24.395
He took most of Boston with him.

31:26.431 --> 31:29.300
That was two weeks after
we thought you were dead.

31:35.240 --> 31:37.808
She's been in v-tach
for more than an hour.

31:37.809 --> 31:40.444
Pulse is off the charts.

31:40.445 --> 31:41.545
There's a reason

31:41.546 --> 31:42.579
we don't let it run its course.

31:42.580 --> 31:43.714
It's not a pretty sight.

31:43.715 --> 31:47.518
Just give it some time.

31:50.622 --> 31:52.723
Heard that before.

32:02.267 --> 32:03.600
I respect you trying to save this girl,

32:03.601 --> 32:05.970
it's even kind of nostalgic,

32:05.971 --> 32:07.905
but come on, this is all just more stuff

32:07.906 --> 32:09.540
for the archaeologists
to find in the future

32:09.541 --> 32:11.809
after we're long gone.

32:11.810 --> 32:14.478
Magnus?

32:17.782 --> 32:20.384
Eastern Honduras, 10 years ago.

32:20.385 --> 32:21.452
I remember.

32:21.453 --> 32:22.954
What about it?

32:22.955 --> 32:24.688
I went there

32:24.689 --> 32:27.391
looking for the tomb
of Pacal the second,

32:27.392 --> 32:29.293
a Mayan king from the late dynasty.

32:29.294 --> 32:30.394
So?

32:31.930 --> 32:34.498
It wasn't long after Ashley had died.

32:34.499 --> 32:35.766
I...

32:35.767 --> 32:38.802
I was tired of outliving people I loved.

32:38.803 --> 32:41.005
I wanted to find a
cure for my longevity.

32:41.006 --> 32:43.040
In a Mayan tomb?

32:43.041 --> 32:46.377
I'd been researching
ancient myths and legends.

32:46.378 --> 32:47.778
How certain cultures had claimed

32:47.779 --> 32:49.080
to have found a way to shorten time,

32:49.081 --> 32:50.448
to manipulate it.

32:50.449 --> 32:52.883
The Mayan kings were abnormals

32:52.884 --> 32:55.652
who aged very slowly, like I do.

32:55.653 --> 32:57.721
T-there was evidence that
they'd developed an elixir

32:57.722 --> 33:00.091
capable of giving them
a normal human lifespan.

33:00.092 --> 33:01.558
The kings wanted a release

33:01.559 --> 33:03.427
from their advanced age.

33:03.428 --> 33:05.496
So you were looking
for a way to grow old.

33:05.497 --> 33:06.864
What does that have to do
with the end of everything?

33:06.865 --> 33:08.432
It doesn't,

33:08.433 --> 33:10.101
except that the Mayan people died out

33:10.102 --> 33:11.735
at an incredibly rapid pace.

33:11.736 --> 33:14.638
The empire fell within several decades.

33:14.639 --> 33:16.707
Entire sections of their population

33:16.708 --> 33:17.841
simply disappeared,

33:17.842 --> 33:20.144
gone without a trace. No one knows why.

33:20.145 --> 33:21.812
So you think that the contagion

33:21.813 --> 33:23.381
that's killed off the intelligent life

33:23.382 --> 33:24.648
on this planet

33:24.649 --> 33:27.151
is the same one that
wiped out the Mayans?

33:27.152 --> 33:28.852
That's not possible.
There'd be evidence...

33:28.853 --> 33:30.854
The virus can mutate.
It is entirely possible.

33:30.855 --> 33:32.356
No.

33:32.357 --> 33:35.759
Will, help me go further with this.

33:35.760 --> 33:38.396
Tell me where things
stood before the end.

33:38.397 --> 33:40.697
Was there anything I had
tried that had come close?

33:40.698 --> 33:42.133
Anything remotely hopeful?

33:42.134 --> 33:43.600
Well, we certainly didn't
talk about the damn Mayans!

33:51.510 --> 33:52.876
Jessica!

34:00.919 --> 34:02.653
Will, no!

34:07.492 --> 34:09.927
She was calling to them!

34:42.427 --> 34:44.962
We need to seal off

34:44.963 --> 34:46.964
any section we can't hold.

34:46.965 --> 34:48.532
Fall back to a safe position

34:48.533 --> 34:49.800
and wait for them to leave.

34:51.136 --> 34:54.670
I'll help out as long as I can.

34:54.672 --> 34:56.206
We can do this, Will.

34:56.208 --> 34:57.541
I'm sure you've been through worse.

34:59.578 --> 35:00.611
No, I haven't.

35:02.814 --> 35:06.517
That last skirmish
didn't go so well for me.

35:12.591 --> 35:15.058
We kill as many as possible,

35:15.059 --> 35:17.628
and then when it's my turn,

35:17.629 --> 35:21.064
you don't hesitate.

35:21.065 --> 35:23.501
Not for one second.

35:43.245 --> 35:44.312
Will!

35:48.884 --> 35:51.986
That should buy us about 15 seconds.

35:54.122 --> 35:56.123
You barricade yourself in here.

35:56.124 --> 35:57.325
Don't let anyone in,

35:57.326 --> 35:59.794
especially me.

35:59.795 --> 36:01.363
Will, I just need some...

36:01.364 --> 36:02.464
Time?

36:05.901 --> 36:07.702
Here...

36:07.703 --> 36:08.837
Take this.

36:12.107 --> 36:14.041
Will...

36:19.415 --> 36:23.251
We had a son...

36:23.252 --> 36:24.886
Kate and me.

36:29.124 --> 36:33.361
He'd be about two now.

36:33.362 --> 36:35.463
He's been living up in the arctic colony

36:35.464 --> 36:36.765
ever since she died.

36:42.037 --> 36:43.505
We named him Magnus.

36:47.342 --> 36:50.111
Magnus Zimmerman.

36:55.217 --> 36:57.118
If you make it out
of here, you find him.

37:28.951 --> 37:30.518
I need to go back further.

37:30.519 --> 37:33.488
The Honduras mission...

37:42.197 --> 37:43.898
from the Mayan tomb

37:43.899 --> 37:45.366
of king Pacal.

37:45.367 --> 37:47.569
I am hopeful about the
one artifact I found there

37:47.570 --> 37:48.937
that matched the legends.

37:48.938 --> 37:50.839
Markings on this

37:50.840 --> 37:52.474
suggest an unorthodox
relationship to time,

37:52.475 --> 37:53.875
the ability to manipulate it at will

37:53.876 --> 37:56.578
via the protection of mystic guardians.

38:08.023 --> 38:10.057
All of this makes me hopeful

38:10.058 --> 38:11.192
that the contents of this vial

38:11.193 --> 38:12.927
are what allowed king Pacal to die

38:12.928 --> 38:15.329
within a normal lifespan.

38:15.330 --> 38:16.898
A full chemical breakdown

38:16.899 --> 38:18.065
and diagnostic of the fluid inside

38:18.066 --> 38:19.367
should reveal its properties.

38:41.056 --> 38:44.926
Seven years and nine months
since the outbreak began.

38:44.927 --> 38:46.594
My unique physiology

38:46.595 --> 38:48.963
seems to have prevented
any outward symptoms.

38:48.964 --> 38:50.965
The contagion mutates at such speed

38:50.966 --> 38:53.467
I'm not sure I can
analyze it fast enough.

38:53.468 --> 38:55.503
There's still no way to control
the immunoglobulin spikes

38:55.504 --> 38:58.105
in the blood of those infected.

38:58.106 --> 39:01.242
Immunoglobulin...

39:20.696 --> 39:23.064
Unfortunately, the elixir from the vial

39:23.065 --> 39:24.599
seems to have had no effect on me

39:24.600 --> 39:26.668
except a spike in my
immunoglobulin levels.

39:26.669 --> 39:28.369
Repeated attempts to
bring them back down

39:28.370 --> 39:29.470
into normal range...

39:29.471 --> 39:32.073
It was the artifact itself.

39:32.074 --> 39:36.110
It held the contagion.

39:44.053 --> 39:47.288
I was patient zero.

39:54.529 --> 39:57.264
I caused this. I caused all of this.

40:10.412 --> 40:13.414
Dear God.

40:22.190 --> 40:24.726
You're keeping it hidden from the world.

40:24.727 --> 40:25.994
Guarding it.

40:33.301 --> 40:35.003
You won't let me destroy it, will you?

40:48.684 --> 40:50.351
Is it safe here?

40:57.059 --> 40:58.993
Thank you.

41:53.315 --> 41:54.648
Hey!

41:54.649 --> 41:56.283
Welcome back.

41:56.284 --> 41:57.651
Wow, nice coat.

41:57.652 --> 41:58.820
Did you pick that up in Honduras?

42:00.422 --> 42:02.323
No, it's... it's one of my own.

42:02.324 --> 42:03.624
Huh.

42:03.625 --> 42:05.292
Well, it's a very good look for you.

42:07.662 --> 42:09.096
So how was the safari?

42:10.232 --> 42:11.532
Safaris are in Africa.

42:11.533 --> 42:12.800
Okay, then the, uh...

42:12.801 --> 42:14.602
"jungle hunt

42:14.603 --> 42:16.403
for the tomb of the Mayan king,"

42:16.404 --> 42:17.571
which, when you think about it,

42:17.572 --> 42:19.707
sounds like a bad cable
special, doesn't it?

42:19.708 --> 42:22.643
Which is why I went alone,
to avoid the mockery.

42:22.644 --> 42:25.379
Ah, that's a good plan.

42:25.380 --> 42:26.447
So did you find it, or what?

42:27.750 --> 42:29.150
The tomb? No.

42:29.151 --> 42:30.417
No, I didn't.

42:30.418 --> 42:31.853
Really?

42:31.854 --> 42:33.354
You did a lot of research.

42:33.355 --> 42:34.488
It's not like you to
strike out like that.

42:34.489 --> 42:36.758
Searched the area for days.

42:36.759 --> 42:38.292
Came up empty, not even a whiff.

42:40.462 --> 42:44.498
We'll just call the trip
a massive tax write-off.

42:44.499 --> 42:47.101
You're totally pissed, aren't you?

42:47.102 --> 42:48.302
That you came up empty.

42:49.604 --> 42:51.405
Absolutely furious.

42:51.406 --> 42:52.606
Come on.

42:52.607 --> 42:54.776
These things happen for a reason, right?

42:57.512 --> 42:59.446
Wow.

42:59.447 --> 43:00.648
Look at that.

43:00.649 --> 43:03.184
What a beautiful day.

43:03.185 --> 43:06.420
Mm...

43:06.421 --> 43:08.589
Not bad, Will.
