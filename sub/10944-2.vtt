Amy:
<i>Previously on "Heartland:"</i>

00:16.072 --> 00:17.406
Amy:
Not again!

00:20.343 --> 00:22.244
Ty: I just want to say-
(Glass clanks)

00:22.528 --> 00:24.296
Oh!
(Cutlery clatters)

00:24.330 --> 00:25.730
<i>Hey! Come here!</i>

00:26.481 --> 00:27.848
<i>Clint:</i>
<i>Her name is Georgina Crawley.</i>

00:27.882 --> 00:29.283
<i>She's eleven years old.</i>

00:29.317 --> 00:30.584
She's been in
the foster care system

00:30.652 --> 00:31.918
since she was three.

00:31.953 --> 00:32.953
I just wanted
to keep you abreast

00:33.054 --> 00:34.421
of another development.

00:34.456 --> 00:35.422
What was it?
What did you find?

00:35.490 --> 00:36.657
Mold.

00:36.691 --> 00:37.658
Mold?

00:37.692 --> 00:38.925
I took something.

00:38.960 --> 00:40.361
Where did you find that?

00:40.395 --> 00:42.095
In the loft.

00:42.130 --> 00:43.530
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Amy?</i>

00:43.564 --> 00:45.899
What're you doin'
up here?

00:45.933 --> 00:48.434
Maybe we should talk
about this.

00:53.741 --> 00:55.508
(Birds chirp)

00:57.244 --> 00:58.679
You found it.

00:59.647 --> 01:00.913
No,
I didn't find it.

01:01.014 --> 01:02.748
Georgie took it.

01:02.849 --> 01:03.949
What?!

01:04.016 --> 01:05.351
But then she gave it
back to me

01:05.419 --> 01:07.654
and I was just gonna hide it
and walk away.

01:07.688 --> 01:11.257
Uh, okay, so, um...
Uh, you know.

01:11.292 --> 01:13.859
Ty, I've known
for months!

01:13.894 --> 01:14.860
You knew-?

01:14.895 --> 01:16.562
It's been driving me crazy!

01:16.596 --> 01:18.564
Well, why didn't you
say something?

01:18.598 --> 01:20.632
'Cause I didn't wanna
ruin the surprise!

01:20.700 --> 01:22.033
And then...

01:22.101 --> 01:24.670
And then you never
brought it up and...

01:24.737 --> 01:26.205
Why?

01:26.239 --> 01:27.772
I was waiting
for the right time, Amy!

01:27.807 --> 01:29.208
The right time?
In four months,

01:29.242 --> 01:32.310
there's never been
a right time?!

01:32.344 --> 01:33.644
(Sputters)

01:33.712 --> 01:34.745
(Sighs)

01:35.980 --> 01:37.881
No.

01:37.916 --> 01:40.384
This isn't fair to you.

01:40.419 --> 01:43.621
This was your decision.
I'm sorry, I...

01:43.689 --> 01:45.155
Let's just...

01:45.190 --> 01:46.957
Let's just not talk about it.

01:49.727 --> 01:50.760
Ty:
Amy!

01:56.066 --> 01:57.234
Amy...

01:57.268 --> 01:59.035
We can't let this go,
okay?

01:59.069 --> 02:00.103
How did you know
about the ring?

02:00.137 --> 02:02.038
Lou swore
she didn't tell you.

02:02.072 --> 02:03.572
Lou knew?

02:04.541 --> 02:05.708
Yeah, she...

02:06.676 --> 02:09.511
Lou knew
and she didn't tell me?

02:09.545 --> 02:11.580
Ty: If Lou didn't tell
you then how did you...?

02:11.615 --> 02:12.914
I found it.

02:12.949 --> 02:14.416
When did you find it?

02:14.451 --> 02:16.151
The night
of the Darkhorse audition,

02:16.185 --> 02:18.420
in your coat pocket.

02:18.455 --> 02:21.088
I was answering your phone
and I found it.

02:21.189 --> 02:22.357
(Sighs)

02:22.391 --> 02:24.692
What made you change
your mind?

02:25.628 --> 02:26.594
You did.

02:26.629 --> 02:27.695
I did?
Are you kidding me?

02:27.730 --> 02:29.731
What did I say?
What did I do?

02:29.798 --> 02:30.965
(Car door shuts)

02:31.032 --> 02:33.768
<i>Kendra:</i>
<i>Yoo-hoo! Anyone here?</i>

02:38.339 --> 02:39.606
Amy:
Hi.

02:39.674 --> 02:41.375
Kendra:
I'm looking for Amy Fleming.

02:41.409 --> 02:42.376
Amy:
That's me.

02:42.410 --> 02:43.610
Kendra:
Good.

02:43.645 --> 02:44.911
Kendra McSlade.
Hi.

02:44.945 --> 02:46.846
I saw your poster
at Maggie's.

02:46.914 --> 02:50.016
I uh...
I think you have my horse.

02:53.787 --> 02:55.588
Sky!

02:55.656 --> 02:57.055
Hey, you bad boy.

02:58.024 --> 03:00.293
You go and get yourself lost?
(Laughs)

03:01.261 --> 03:03.128
Momma's here now.

03:03.163 --> 03:04.563
So his name's Sky?

03:04.631 --> 03:05.964
Yeah.

03:05.999 --> 03:07.532
His registered name
is "Sky's the Limit."

03:07.566 --> 03:08.667
Come here, Sky.
(Clicks teeth)

03:08.701 --> 03:09.867
Come here, boy.

03:09.902 --> 03:11.135
(Horse snorts)

03:16.208 --> 03:18.042
It's so great
that he's safe.

03:18.076 --> 03:19.778
Thank you so much
for looking after him,

03:19.812 --> 03:21.813
and please let me reimburse you
for any costs.

03:21.847 --> 03:23.214
No, no,
it was my pleasure.

03:23.248 --> 03:25.015
I really enjoyed
having him.

03:25.049 --> 03:27.250
Thatat's very generous
of you.

03:27.285 --> 03:28.719
He's quite the jumper,
huh?

03:28.753 --> 03:30.554
I couldn't keep him
from jumpin' that fence,

03:30.622 --> 03:32.923
so I actually started
free jumping him.

03:32.957 --> 03:35.258
- Really?
- He is quite a natural.

03:35.293 --> 03:36.460
Wow, that's crazy.

03:37.796 --> 03:39.429
<i>So I'd like to take him</i>
<i>home with me,</i>

03:39.496 --> 03:40.830
but I came straight
from Maggie's

03:40.897 --> 03:42.231
after seeing your notice.

03:42.299 --> 03:44.600
So if it's okay to keep him
one more night,

03:44.635 --> 03:45.802
I'll bring the trailer
tomorrow?

03:45.836 --> 03:47.470
Yeah, of course.
That's fine.

03:47.571 --> 03:49.605
Thank you so much!

03:52.409 --> 03:54.377
(Truck door shuts
and truck starts up)

04:00.082 --> 04:01.817
(Lobo barks the distance)

04:09.258 --> 04:10.592
Tim: You know,
this is so typical

04:10.660 --> 04:12.593
that this whole crazy
Georgie business

04:12.661 --> 04:14.928
(grinder whirs)
Is goin' on at the se time

04:14.963 --> 04:18.130
that I'm trying to put
my franchise thing together.

04:18.199 --> 04:20.166
Story of my life,
Jack.

04:20.201 --> 04:22.202
One step forward,
two steps back.

04:22.237 --> 04:23.838
Well, this crazy
Georgie business

04:23.872 --> 04:25.005
that you're talkin' about

04:25.039 --> 04:26.374
is a lot more important

04:26.408 --> 04:28.207
than your latest
flight of fantasy.

04:28.242 --> 04:29.809
Why don't you just
get Clint to do it?

04:29.844 --> 04:33.012
Things are already complicated
around here enough.

04:33.080 --> 04:34.046
Amy:
Hi, Katie.

04:34.081 --> 04:35.815
Tim:
Hi.

04:35.850 --> 04:36.883
<i>Amy:</i> <i>Lou, you've known
about</i> <i>the ring for months</i>

04:36.917 --> 04:38.317
and you pretended
like you didn't?!

04:38.352 --> 04:39.519
Tim: What ring?
Lou: What?!

04:39.553 --> 04:40.854
Amy:
Well, can you just answer me?

04:40.888 --> 04:43.722
Wait. Okay,
you know that I know.

04:43.757 --> 04:44.723
How do you know that?

04:44.758 --> 04:45.957
Because Ty told me!

04:45.992 --> 04:47.459
What do you know?

04:47.527 --> 04:48.827
Amy:
Come here.

04:49.796 --> 04:51.062
I confided in you
about the ring

04:51.097 --> 04:52.598
and did you say anything?
No!

04:52.632 --> 04:53.599
- I couldn't.
- Why?!

04:53.633 --> 04:55.133
Amy, I just couldn't!

04:55.201 --> 04:57.002
Jack: Okay, girls,
what seems to be-

04:57.036 --> 04:58.737
Amy: But how could you keep a
secret from me like that?!

04:58.805 --> 04:59.970
We had to.

05:00.038 --> 05:01.706
Amy:
We?!

05:01.740 --> 05:03.741
Grandpa, you knew?

05:03.776 --> 05:04.842
Knew what?

05:04.877 --> 05:07.311
I don't believe you guys!

05:10.716 --> 05:11.783
(Bedroom door bangs shut)

05:12.751 --> 05:13.818
(Screen door creaks shut)

05:13.852 --> 05:14.852
Tim:
Something I should know?

05:14.920 --> 05:16.853
Jack:
No, I...

05:16.888 --> 05:18.755
I don't think so.

06:03.698 --> 06:06.366
Lou: Ty, why would you ever tell
Amy that I knew about the ring?

06:06.400 --> 06:08.569
That was supposed
to be our secret, remember?

06:08.603 --> 06:09.770
It doesn't matter, Lou.

06:09.804 --> 06:11.338
It's pretty much
screwed up now.

06:11.372 --> 06:12.439
Lou: All right, well, where
did you even find it?

06:12.507 --> 06:13.239
I looked everywhere
for that thing!

06:13.274 --> 06:14.475
Ty:
Georgie took it

06:14.542 --> 06:17.377
and then she gave it
back to Amy.

06:17.411 --> 06:19.512
Well,
where are you going?

06:19.613 --> 06:20.780
Ty:
Back to the trailer.

06:20.814 --> 06:21.814
Oh, right, yeah.
Get out of town

06:21.849 --> 06:23.683
and leave me
to take the heat.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.818
Ty...

06:25.853 --> 06:27.219
I've completely screwed
this whole thing up.

06:27.253 --> 06:29.288
Yeah, pretty much.

06:31.558 --> 06:32.892
Ty, just...

06:41.601 --> 06:44.536
(Cutlery scrapes,
tense silence around table)

06:49.275 --> 06:50.675
Amy: Hey, Peter, can you
please pass me the buns?

06:54.013 --> 06:55.713
(Annoyed sigh)

06:58.617 --> 06:59.884
Amy: Thank you.
Peter: Sure.

07:02.454 --> 07:05.156
Tim: So I finally got a
meeting with Buff Chomsky,

07:05.190 --> 07:06.357
the CEO...

07:06.392 --> 07:08.126
Of Buff Burger, I know.

07:08.193 --> 07:09.126
<i>Tim:</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

07:09.193 --> 07:10.728
So are you gonna come?

07:10.762 --> 07:11.996
No!

07:12.030 --> 07:14.064
Okay. Fine.

07:18.003 --> 07:22.072
So who pulled in here
with that truck this afternoon?

07:23.041 --> 07:24.707
Amy...

07:24.742 --> 07:26.709
<i>I'm asking you</i>
<i>a question.</i>

07:26.744 --> 07:28.277
Phoenix's owner.

07:28.311 --> 07:29.679
Well, that's good.
It's about time, isn't it?

07:29.713 --> 07:31.347
When are they picking him up?

07:31.381 --> 07:33.382
Tomorrow morning.

07:38.789 --> 07:39.856
(Door shuts)

07:42.391 --> 07:43.659
Tim: You' just gonna
let that happen?

07:43.726 --> 07:44.760
(Door shuts)

07:49.031 --> 07:50.631
Georgie...

07:50.666 --> 07:51.732
How could you?

07:51.800 --> 07:53.267
How could I what?

07:53.301 --> 07:55.235
Let that horrible woman
take him!

07:55.303 --> 07:56.938
She's a big fake!

07:56.972 --> 07:59.273
You didn't even
meet her.

07:59.340 --> 08:00.541
I watched her.

08:02.578 --> 08:04.344
(Sighs heavily)

08:04.379 --> 08:05.912
I know you like Phoenix,
okay,

08:05.947 --> 08:08.048
but he doesn't
belong to us!

08:08.115 --> 08:10.249
Did you even ask her
for any proof?

08:10.317 --> 08:12.418
How do you know
she's not lying?

08:12.453 --> 08:14.688
Well, why would she lie?

08:14.755 --> 08:17.090
People lie all the time!

08:17.157 --> 08:18.792
Phoenix doesn't belong to us,
okay?

08:18.859 --> 08:20.426
He's not our horse.

08:20.461 --> 08:22.661
I always knew he was from
somewhere around here.

08:22.696 --> 08:24.463
Maybe he didn't like it
where he was.

08:24.497 --> 08:26.498
Well, I don't know
if he did or not.

08:26.532 --> 08:28.968
<i>Georgie:</i>
<i>He jumps fences.</i>

08:29.035 --> 08:31.770
You don't get good at jumping
unless you got a reason to.

08:39.010 --> 08:40.010
(Sighs heavily)

08:40.044 --> 08:41.145
(Door shuts)

08:43.082 --> 08:44.582
Hey, there.

08:45.584 --> 08:47.819
Amy, don't give me
the cold shoulder.

08:47.853 --> 08:51.455
Come over here
and talk to me, please?

08:57.962 --> 08:59.863
Look, I'm sorry.

09:01.132 --> 09:03.900
Yes, I did know
about Ty's plans

09:03.968 --> 09:05.435
and so did Lou.

09:06.403 --> 09:09.005
But to be fair
we figured that...

09:09.039 --> 09:10.973
Since there was
no big announcement,

09:11.008 --> 09:12.541
<i>that something</i>
<i>must have happened</i>

09:12.575 --> 09:14.877
<i>between the two of you</i>
<i>to change things.</i>

09:14.945 --> 09:16.779
Nothing happened between us.

09:17.714 --> 09:20.215
Just...

09:20.250 --> 09:24.020
Ty must have decided that
it wasn't what he wanted.

09:24.954 --> 09:27.588
Let me ask you something.

09:28.557 --> 09:29.891
What would you have said

09:29.925 --> 09:33.028
if he did ask you
that night?

09:39.268 --> 09:40.401
I don't know.

09:42.470 --> 09:44.772
<i>Jack:</i>
<i>Well...</i>

09:44.806 --> 09:46.306
You have to figure
that out then,

09:46.374 --> 09:48.241
don't you?

10:03.590 --> 10:04.991
(Lobo snorts)

10:05.559 --> 10:08.061
<i>Georgie:</i>
<i>Ugh! Your dog slobbered on me!</i>

10:09.329 --> 10:11.430
Amy:
Sorry. He does that.

10:14.901 --> 10:17.368
Georgie,
you have to understand

10:17.403 --> 10:20.605
that a lot of horses
come and go through Heartland.

10:20.639 --> 10:22.640
That's what I do;

10:22.675 --> 10:25.110
I help them until they can go
back to their owners

10:25.144 --> 10:26.978
or I find new owners for them.

10:27.980 --> 10:31.182
It's all very temporary.
You can't get too attached.

10:31.216 --> 10:32.616
You know what?

10:32.684 --> 10:35.652
You're the worst kind
of phony there is.

10:36.621 --> 10:37.654
Excuse me?

10:38.924 --> 10:40.224
Don't get too attached.

10:40.258 --> 10:42.093
<i>It's just temporary.</i>

10:42.160 --> 10:43.460
Do you think
I haven't heard that crap

10:43.494 --> 10:45.995
a million times before?

10:46.030 --> 10:49.232
Do you think
I don't know what it means?

10:54.772 --> 10:55.839
(Lobo pants)

10:58.776 --> 11:00.543
(Rooster crows,
birds chirp)

11:01.677 --> 11:05.914
Peter: Yes, Dom, I'm well aware
that's it's an old house...

11:05.949 --> 11:08.851
Lou: Okay, here you go, Katie!
There you go.

11:10.253 --> 11:12.054
Peter:
I'll come by, yeah.

11:12.088 --> 11:13.421
Lou: Does this dog seriously
have to be right in the way

11:13.456 --> 11:15.423
all the time?

11:15.458 --> 11:17.024
Peter:
Hey, honey, I got a meeting

11:17.059 --> 11:18.726
and we gotta hook up with Dom
and this mold stuff,

11:18.794 --> 11:20.494
so can we just go maybe?

11:20.528 --> 11:23.064
Lou: Yeah, I just have
to fix Katie's snack.

11:23.098 --> 11:24.732
Peter:
They provide snacks at daycare.

11:24.767 --> 11:25.867
Lou: Yeah, but not the healthy
kind that mommy bakes,

11:25.901 --> 11:27.268
right, Kitty Kat?

11:28.203 --> 11:29.804
What's the matter, honey?
You got an itchy?

11:29.905 --> 11:31.605
Katie:
Mmm.

11:31.673 --> 11:33.706
Lou:
What's wrong?

11:33.741 --> 11:35.408
Flea bites?!
She is covered in flea bites!

11:35.442 --> 11:36.442
It's that damn dog!

11:36.510 --> 11:37.510
Amy:
It is not!

11:37.544 --> 11:39.246
Lou:
Amy, look at them!

11:39.280 --> 11:40.546
Amy: Lobo does not have fleas, Lou!
I should know.

11:40.581 --> 11:41.882
He sleeps in my bed
every night!

11:41.949 --> 11:43.449
Yeah, and that is why
he is so spoiled.

11:43.484 --> 11:44.450
Come on!
Out you go, big flea bag!

11:44.485 --> 11:46.519
Amy:
Lou, leave him alone!

11:46.587 --> 11:48.655
Lou: Amy, he is an outside dog.
How many times have I told you?

11:48.689 --> 11:50.722
Amy: No, don't tell me anything!
Don't even talk to me!

11:50.757 --> 11:52.258
Peter:
Guys, calm down.

11:52.292 --> 11:53.325
Lou: Fine! I won't talk to you!
<i>Amy: Good!</i>

11:53.359 --> 11:54.260
Lou:
Just get him out of here!

11:54.294 --> 11:55.560
Amy:
Okay, fine!

11:55.595 --> 11:56.962
I'd gladly be anywhere
than with you!

11:58.932 --> 11:59.999
Lou:
Honey...

12:01.101 --> 12:02.434
Kendra:
There's my baby.

12:02.502 --> 12:04.303
Amy:
He's all set.

12:04.337 --> 12:06.704
Kendra: Oh, you look so
handsome too, don't you, Sky?

12:06.772 --> 12:08.139
(Horse whinnies)

12:09.041 --> 12:10.374
Thanks for grooming him
so beautifully.

12:10.409 --> 12:12.410
It's okay.
It's okay, baby.

12:12.444 --> 12:13.845
Amy:
No problem.

12:19.218 --> 12:21.418
(Trailer gate clanks shut)

12:40.838 --> 12:43.405
(Truck rumbles away)

12:44.419 --> 12:47.303
Peter: <i>Lou, honey, she's fine.</i>
<i>Can we go, please?</i>

12:47.304 --> 12:49.908
Peter,
please stop pushing me.

12:49.942 --> 12:52.010
Do you have any idea
how awful I feel?

12:52.044 --> 12:53.611
You know on top of having
a flea-infested daughter,

12:53.645 --> 12:55.613
Amy is so mad at me!

12:55.647 --> 12:56.614
But what else could
I have done, Peter?

12:56.648 --> 12:58.582
Honestly, tell me,
what?

12:58.617 --> 13:00.451
I don't know, honey.

13:00.485 --> 13:01.719
You just talk it out with her
and I'm sure it'll be fine.

13:01.787 --> 13:02.853
You know,
Ty swore me to secrecy

13:02.888 --> 13:04.022
about that ring.

13:04.056 --> 13:05.089
And anyways,
Amy would have been

13:05.124 --> 13:06.456
an even bigger
basket case

13:06.490 --> 13:08.091
if I had told her

13:08.126 --> 13:09.526
<i>that Ty was planning on</i>
<i>asking her to marry him,</i>

13:09.560 --> 13:12.129
<i>because get what?</i>
<i>He didn't!</i>

13:13.097 --> 13:14.398
- What?
- Um...

13:14.465 --> 13:16.066
What did you just say?

13:17.001 --> 13:18.735
I thought I heard you say

13:18.769 --> 13:20.938
that Ty was gonna ask Amy
to marry him.

13:20.972 --> 13:21.871
So that's what
the ring is about?

13:21.939 --> 13:23.139
Dad, it's just...

13:23.173 --> 13:25.007
I get it now.

13:25.042 --> 13:27.977
So he didn't ask me.

13:28.011 --> 13:29.511
So it's happenin'
all over again!

13:29.579 --> 13:31.180
Does this remind you
of somethin', general?

13:31.214 --> 13:33.816
<i>Lou:</i> <i>Dad, it's not like that.
</i> <i>Ty asked Grandpa.</i>

13:33.850 --> 13:35.717
Oh, of course he did!

13:35.752 --> 13:37.053
Honey, I gotta go.

13:37.087 --> 13:38.853
Lou: Yeah, we gotta go.
Bye, Dad.

13:38.887 --> 13:40.488
Jack:
Have you guys seen Georgie?

13:40.522 --> 13:42.157
She hasn't had any breakfast.
There's no sign of her.

13:42.191 --> 13:43.992
Lou:
No. Sorry, Grandpa.

13:44.961 --> 13:46.027
Peter:
Bye.

13:48.530 --> 13:50.231
When were you
gonna tell me?

13:50.333 --> 13:51.599
Tell you what?

13:51.633 --> 13:53.768
When were you gonna tell me

13:53.802 --> 13:57.171
that Ty asked your permission
to marry Amy?

13:58.106 --> 14:00.474
Well, since he never
did ask her,

14:00.508 --> 14:02.141
he probably decided
he could skip that step

14:02.209 --> 14:03.343
and so did I!

14:03.410 --> 14:04.643
But he asked you first,
Jack;

14:04.678 --> 14:05.544
That's what I'm talkin' about.

14:05.645 --> 14:06.846
He asked you first!

14:06.880 --> 14:08.281
Come on, Tim...

14:08.315 --> 14:11.184
I mean, one time might've been
an oversight,

14:11.251 --> 14:12.785
but twice?
That's...

14:14.955 --> 14:17.923
I'm Lou's father
and I am Amy's father.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.459
What is it
about that fact

14:20.527 --> 14:22.160
that these guys
don't understand?

14:22.195 --> 14:23.362
<i>Jack:</i>
<i>You know what?</i>

14:23.396 --> 14:25.598
Get over it.

14:25.632 --> 14:27.800
I've got a missin' kid
to worry about here.

14:33.640 --> 14:34.939
(Door bangs shut)

14:43.749 --> 14:44.782
(Door clicks shut)

14:44.817 --> 14:45.783
(Barn door clanks open)

14:45.818 --> 14:47.619
(Horse whinnies)

14:47.720 --> 14:49.487
(Door squeaks closed)

14:51.022 --> 14:52.389
(Flies buzz)

14:58.796 --> 15:00.664
(Horses whinny)

15:05.937 --> 15:07.570
(Door squeaks open)

15:08.539 --> 15:09.605
(Flies buzz)

15:11.341 --> 15:13.342
(Horses whinny)

15:13.376 --> 15:14.844
Okay, Sky, my big boy.

15:17.014 --> 15:18.080
You listen to me!

15:18.148 --> 15:20.950
No more jumping,
you got it?

15:22.785 --> 15:24.986
One of these days...
(Stall door clanks shut)

15:25.021 --> 15:26.387
You're gonna jump a fence

15:26.422 --> 15:28.690
and you're really gonna
hurt yourself.

15:28.724 --> 15:30.425
If it hurts you,
it hurts me.

15:32.294 --> 15:33.862
(Sighs)

15:33.930 --> 15:36.765
I hope you learn your lesson,

15:36.799 --> 15:37.732
'cause I'm gonna keep you
in here

15:37.767 --> 15:40.500
from now on, baby.

15:40.535 --> 15:42.836
You can't escape
ever again.

15:45.440 --> 15:46.473
I love you.

15:47.842 --> 15:49.843
I'm not gonna lose you.

15:51.179 --> 15:53.047
(Flies buzz loudly,
horses whinny)

15:55.315 --> 15:56.883
(Door creaks open)

15:59.486 --> 16:01.520
<i>(Approaching footsteps)</i>

16:07.761 --> 16:08.795
Hey.

16:10.730 --> 16:11.763
Hi.

16:13.600 --> 16:15.366
(Sighs heavily)

16:23.309 --> 16:24.342
(Sighs)

16:25.612 --> 16:28.312
That night,
after your audition,

16:29.414 --> 16:31.482
I was all set
to ask you,

16:31.516 --> 16:33.550
and then you said -

16:34.486 --> 16:36.053
and you were serious -

16:36.088 --> 16:38.188
that there was so much more
that we should be doing

16:38.256 --> 16:40.858
with our lives,

16:40.892 --> 16:43.893
and that we shouldn't
tie each other down.

16:43.928 --> 16:45.528
And I thought...

16:46.497 --> 16:49.532
How can I go forward
from here,

16:49.600 --> 16:50.834
you know?

16:51.836 --> 16:53.770
I was gonna ask you again.

16:53.804 --> 16:56.806
I thought maybe
you'd changed your mind.

16:56.841 --> 16:59.041
And then I poured water
all over you,

16:59.075 --> 17:02.244
and then I lost the ring -
or thought I did.

17:02.278 --> 17:04.680
Jack:
You guys seen Georgie?!

17:06.849 --> 17:09.084
Well, I need your help
to look for her.

17:16.391 --> 17:17.791
(Horse snuffles)

17:19.828 --> 17:21.896
(Horses whinnie)

17:24.165 --> 17:25.199
(Flies buzz)

17:35.342 --> 17:37.744
(Horse whinnies in distress)

17:40.014 --> 17:41.114
(Flies buzz)

17:57.263 --> 17:58.630
(Horse whinnies in distress)

18:05.705 --> 18:08.940
Georgie: Hey, I'm gonna get
you out of here, okay?

18:08.974 --> 18:10.041
I promise.

18:18.383 --> 18:20.117
You asked Jack...

18:20.218 --> 18:22.385
And you talked to Lou?

18:22.420 --> 18:24.154
Excuse me?

18:24.222 --> 18:25.689
You asked Jack
for permission

18:25.724 --> 18:27.725
to marry my daughter.

18:27.759 --> 18:29.026
This is all pointless,
Tim,

18:29.094 --> 18:30.527
because I didn't ask Amy.

18:30.561 --> 18:32.162
But you were going to!

18:32.197 --> 18:35.064
Just 'cause you didn't
doesn't change anything.

18:35.132 --> 18:36.432
Well, yes it does,

18:36.499 --> 18:38.634
because technically
I haven't asked her,

18:38.736 --> 18:39.969
so, technically,

18:40.003 --> 18:41.270
I could still ask
for your permission.

18:41.338 --> 18:44.140
Technically?
What's technical about this?

18:44.174 --> 18:45.241
You want my permission?

18:45.275 --> 18:47.176
Yes!

18:47.244 --> 18:49.045
No! I... I don't know,

18:49.079 --> 18:51.246
'cause it's all wrecked now
anyway, so...

18:51.280 --> 18:53.648
What? What's wrecked?
What's wrong with you?

18:53.682 --> 18:55.550
You wanna marry her
or not?

18:55.618 --> 18:57.052
Are you some kind
of a wimp?

18:57.086 --> 18:59.454
You think I want my daughter
to marry a wimp?

18:59.488 --> 19:01.890
So if you're gonna ask her,
then ask her right

19:01.924 --> 19:04.159
and don't hurt her
for another minute,

19:04.193 --> 19:05.193
because don't think
I don't know

19:05.228 --> 19:06.694
that she knows
about the ring.

19:06.729 --> 19:08.729
I'm her father.

19:08.764 --> 19:10.264
I know stuff.

19:10.331 --> 19:12.332
Okay, fine. Tim,
(Phone alarm beeps)

19:12.367 --> 19:14.334
Do I have your permission
to marry your daughter?

19:14.369 --> 19:15.636
I'm late for my Buff Burger
appointment -

19:15.670 --> 19:18.405
thank you very much for that.

19:18.439 --> 19:20.440
That's great!

19:20.475 --> 19:23.676
And in answer
to your question: No.

19:23.710 --> 19:25.111
<i>You don't have my permission.</i>

19:25.146 --> 19:26.479
(Truck door slams shut)

19:29.316 --> 19:31.284
(Horse whinnies loudly)

19:42.996 --> 19:44.196
Georgie:
(Gasps) Agh! Oh!

19:44.230 --> 19:46.231
(Groans, disgusted)

19:47.433 --> 19:49.001
<i>Kendra:</i>
<i>Hey!</i>

19:49.035 --> 19:51.203
Who are you?!

19:51.237 --> 19:53.138
What are you doing
snooping around here?

19:59.667 --> 20:01.601
<i>Kendra:</i> <i>She stowed away</i>
<i>in my trailer.</i>

20:01.636 --> 20:02.969
She broke into my stable.

20:03.004 --> 20:04.471
I'm sorry.

20:04.572 --> 20:05.805
She was stealing my horse!

20:05.840 --> 20:07.340
I know, but-

20:07.374 --> 20:08.642
Krendra: If I hadn't
walked in when I did,

20:08.676 --> 20:09.676
who knows what would have
happened to her

20:09.710 --> 20:11.377
or my horse?!

20:11.445 --> 20:13.112
I'm sorry.

20:13.213 --> 20:14.848
Mr. Bartlett,

20:14.882 --> 20:16.683
I don't presume to know
what the situation is here,

20:16.717 --> 20:18.284
but if I find her on my property
one more time

20:18.318 --> 20:20.486
I will call the police.

20:20.555 --> 20:21.687
I mean it.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.355
Yes, I know you do.

20:31.264 --> 20:33.265
You just earned yourself
a job.

20:37.403 --> 20:39.637
That was a really stupid thing
you did.

20:39.672 --> 20:41.272
You could have been
seriously hurt.

20:44.643 --> 20:46.243
You missed a spot.

20:49.147 --> 20:50.247
What?

20:51.349 --> 20:52.650
(Sighs)

20:52.718 --> 20:56.019
Okay, this place,

20:56.088 --> 20:57.621
is it how
it's supposed to be?

20:57.689 --> 21:00.157
What do you mean?

21:00.192 --> 21:02.025
It's so clean.

21:02.060 --> 21:04.428
Well,
it has to be.

21:04.463 --> 21:07.565
And this barn,
is it special?

21:07.632 --> 21:10.333
Special?
No, it's...

21:10.401 --> 21:11.968
It's a little small.

21:12.035 --> 21:13.035
I keep telling Grandpa
we need to extend it

21:13.104 --> 21:14.304
out the back

21:14.338 --> 21:17.474
and add half a dozen stalls
or so.

21:17.508 --> 21:19.375
And that would mean, like,
how many more horses?

21:19.410 --> 21:21.478
Six stalls,
six horses.

21:21.512 --> 21:22.812
So what you're saying is,

21:22.846 --> 21:25.448
this is just a totally
normal barn?

21:25.516 --> 21:27.850
Yeah, I guess so.

21:27.884 --> 21:30.252
What are you saying?

21:30.286 --> 21:31.625
(Inhales deeply)

21:31.786 --> 21:34.225
Nothing. Just curious.

21:37.628 --> 21:39.228
Hey, wait.

21:39.295 --> 21:41.330
It's just her place,

21:41.364 --> 21:42.697
the horrible woman's place,

21:42.732 --> 21:43.865
the barn was crammed
so full of horses

21:43.899 --> 21:45.399
they could barely move!

21:45.467 --> 21:47.535
There were dozens of them
smushed into stalls!

21:47.569 --> 21:49.871
And there was crap everywhere
and it really stunk!

21:49.905 --> 21:52.841
And the horses...
They looked bad!

21:53.743 --> 21:55.076
Like how bad?

21:55.111 --> 21:57.912
Bad - like really,
really bad.

22:00.148 --> 22:01.181
(Truck rumbles)

22:21.635 --> 22:22.835
<i>Kendra:</i>
<i>Amy.</i>

22:23.804 --> 22:25.571
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:25.605 --> 22:26.773
What can I do
for you?

22:26.807 --> 22:27.573
Oh, I just came to see
how Phoe-

22:27.607 --> 22:29.575
uh, Sky was doing.

22:29.609 --> 22:30.909
I hope he's settled in,
okay?

22:30.977 --> 22:32.778
Oh, aren't you sweet?
He's fine.

22:32.845 --> 22:34.212
He's happy to be home.

22:34.280 --> 22:35.714
Good.

22:35.782 --> 22:36.882
Not that you didn't take
excellent care of him.

22:36.916 --> 22:38.516
I think he just missed
the other horses.

22:38.584 --> 22:41.252
Oh, absolutely.
They do miss their buddies.

22:41.287 --> 22:42.353
Yes, they do.

22:44.490 --> 22:47.257
Um, I was just wondering
if maybe I could see him?

22:47.292 --> 22:48.693
Figures I'd miss him.

22:48.727 --> 22:49.894
I'm sorry.

22:49.928 --> 22:52.196
He's in the back field
right now.

22:53.131 --> 22:54.598
Okay.

22:54.632 --> 22:57.301
All right, well,
I'm glad he's settled in.

22:57.368 --> 22:58.502
Thanks.

23:04.341 --> 23:06.076
Hey
I got your message.

23:06.110 --> 23:07.911
What's going on?
Is she okay?

23:07.978 --> 23:10.546
Lou: No, no, she's not okay.
Honey, look at this rash.

23:10.647 --> 23:12.348
Peter:
Let me see, baby.

23:12.416 --> 23:14.550
Lou: Look, it's spreading.
It is definitely spreading.

23:14.618 --> 23:16.452
Peter:
(Sighs)

23:16.486 --> 23:18.854
No, it's not.
It's just redder, Lou,

23:18.888 --> 23:20.288
like she's been scratching it
or something.

23:20.323 --> 23:21.690
You called me out of a meeting
for this, honey?

23:21.725 --> 23:23.192
No, honey,
you should have seen her-

23:23.226 --> 23:25.027
You have to calm down,
okay?

23:25.095 --> 23:26.929
You're getting way
too upset about this.

23:26.963 --> 23:28.230
And my guess is,

23:28.264 --> 23:30.065
that it's not
just about the rash.

23:30.133 --> 23:32.367
Am I right?

23:32.401 --> 23:36.170
You have to make things right
with your sister, okay?

23:36.205 --> 23:39.941
Okay, okay, I will.
But she, you know-

23:39.975 --> 23:42.110
Peter:
No, just...

23:42.144 --> 23:45.379
She looks fine to me.
You're fine, aren't ya?

23:45.413 --> 23:48.482
Can you tell mommy you're okay?
Yeah?

23:51.853 --> 23:53.186
(Truck rumbles)

23:58.626 --> 23:59.760
(Truck stops)

24:08.068 --> 24:10.469
(Horse whinnies)

24:14.374 --> 24:15.607
(Horse whinnies)

24:15.675 --> 24:17.176
(Flies buzz)

24:23.582 --> 24:24.515
Oh my God.

24:24.583 --> 24:26.450
(Horse whinnies)

24:26.735 --> 24:27.868
Phoenix, hey.

24:29.471 --> 24:30.538
Oh, buddy.

24:33.342 --> 24:35.709
<i>Kendra: Excuse me.</i>
<i>Amy: (Gasps)</i>

24:35.744 --> 24:37.512
What're you doing here?

24:38.747 --> 24:40.080
Kendra, this place,

24:40.148 --> 24:41.515
this is way too small

24:41.549 --> 24:43.150
for the amount of horses
you have in here.

24:43.184 --> 24:45.252
Is that right?

24:45.319 --> 24:47.820
I've been breeding horses
forever.

24:47.855 --> 24:49.689
I don't need someone like you
telling me what to do.

24:49.757 --> 24:51.791
This is absolutely disgusting,
Krendra!

24:51.825 --> 24:53.160
There's horses
in the aisle.

24:53.227 --> 24:54.194
The stalls are filthy.

24:54.228 --> 24:55.994
They don't have any water!

24:56.029 --> 24:57.496
I was...

24:57.531 --> 24:59.365
So worried about Sky
for the last few days,

24:59.433 --> 25:02.501
I guess I neglected
my chores a bit.

25:02.536 --> 25:06.038
This is a lot more
than a few days of neglect.

25:06.073 --> 25:07.639
(Angry sigh)

25:07.674 --> 25:10.076
Okay, you know what?
Mind your business.

25:10.110 --> 25:12.110
Get off my property.

25:13.112 --> 25:14.745
Now! Get out!

25:17.015 --> 25:19.050
(Horse whinnies)

25:23.956 --> 25:25.290
(Horse whinnies)

25:26.892 --> 25:27.924
Shh...

25:31.929 --> 25:34.764
Okay, you were right.
Kendra's stable is a mess.

25:34.832 --> 25:36.266
It's inhumane.

25:36.301 --> 25:38.535
So what're you gonna do
about it?

25:38.570 --> 25:40.137
Amy:
I don't know,

25:40.171 --> 25:41.905
but there is definitely
something going on there.

25:41.939 --> 25:44.840
Well, yeah,
she's an animal hoarder.

25:44.908 --> 25:46.942
Haven't you ever watched
that show?

25:46.977 --> 25:48.744
Those people
are freako nutbars.

25:48.812 --> 25:49.878
Georgie...

25:49.946 --> 25:52.014
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Amy, we need to talk.</i>

25:52.983 --> 25:54.484
No, this dog,
this flea bag

25:54.518 --> 25:55.718
cannot be in the house
any more.

25:55.785 --> 25:58.954
Amy, I told you!
Out! Out! Go!

25:59.022 --> 26:00.021
Georgie:
Come on.

26:00.055 --> 26:01.689
Thank you, Georgie.

26:02.525 --> 26:04.593
Katie's bites are worse
and they've spread, okay?

26:04.660 --> 26:06.761
So...
(Sighs heavily)

26:08.797 --> 26:11.699
I came here because
I wanted to apologize, okay?

26:11.734 --> 26:13.368
I wanna say I'm sorry

26:13.402 --> 26:15.336
I didn't say anything
about the ring,

26:15.370 --> 26:16.837
<i>but Ty swore me to secrecy</i>

26:16.871 --> 26:18.172
<i>and I couldn't betray</i>
<i>that trust!</i>

26:18.206 --> 26:19.673
Amy, how could I?

26:21.042 --> 26:23.010
Amy, please...

26:23.044 --> 26:24.111
(Cell phone beeps)

26:28.517 --> 26:30.151
(Beeps)

26:30.218 --> 26:31.684
Oh my God!

26:31.718 --> 26:32.885
(Reading)
"Dear Mrs. Morris,"

26:32.919 --> 26:34.254
there have been cases
of head lice

26:34.288 --> 26:35.655
reported at the daycare.

26:35.689 --> 26:37.223
Please examine your child
for signs of it.

26:37.291 --> 26:39.192
"All necessary preventative
measures should be taken."

26:39.226 --> 26:40.826
Oh my God, Katie!

26:40.894 --> 26:43.630
I told you Lobo
didn't have fleas! Ha!

26:43.664 --> 26:45.165
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Peter!</i>

26:45.883 --> 26:46.582
Ty:
Hey.

26:47.350 --> 26:48.417
Tim:
Hey, Ty.

26:52.555 --> 26:54.756
How was that appointment?

26:54.791 --> 26:56.091
Not good.

26:57.093 --> 27:00.229
Never get involved
with a franchise.

27:00.263 --> 27:02.231
You know what that guy wanted
for an upfront payment?

27:04.499 --> 27:07.701
Well, let's just say
it was in the high six figures.

27:07.736 --> 27:08.736
Well, I'm sorry
to hear that.

27:08.770 --> 27:10.972
Yeah,
don't tell Jack, huh?

27:11.941 --> 27:13.341
No problem.

27:13.375 --> 27:15.176
Ty. Ty, listen.

27:18.213 --> 27:21.148
I know I was harsh
with you before.

27:23.551 --> 27:25.953
I know how you feel
about Amy,

27:26.854 --> 27:30.190
and I have no idea why,
but she...

27:31.225 --> 27:32.759
She seems to like you too.

27:32.827 --> 27:34.861
So...

27:34.895 --> 27:35.962
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>So...</i>

27:38.265 --> 27:41.367
Do I have your permission,
sir?

27:48.241 --> 27:49.342
Yeah.

27:50.944 --> 27:52.643
But just- I'll take
care of her, Tim.

27:52.678 --> 27:55.080
No, no, I know you will.
It's not... not that.

27:55.147 --> 27:57.449
Just a word of warning:

27:57.483 --> 27:59.150
Just be careful.

28:01.187 --> 28:02.887
You know, getting engaged
or married too young,

28:02.921 --> 28:04.689
that's...

28:04.723 --> 28:06.591
That's what made it so difficult
for me and Marion.

28:08.526 --> 28:10.827
We loved each other,
we really did,

28:10.862 --> 28:13.130
and we had some good times
together.

28:13.164 --> 28:16.100
But we changed
as we grew up,

28:16.167 --> 28:17.501
and we grew apart,

28:17.535 --> 28:20.304
and we didn't make it
for the long haul.

28:20.338 --> 28:22.239
I'm just sayin'

28:22.307 --> 28:25.808
that's something
to think about.

28:25.842 --> 28:26.742
Well, I think Amy and I
are good

28:26.776 --> 28:27.743
for the long haul.

28:27.777 --> 28:29.278
I know you do...

28:29.346 --> 28:30.380
Now.

28:32.249 --> 28:33.649
Good luck.

28:41.957 --> 28:43.358
Okay, so you can grab

28:43.393 --> 28:44.559
all of the stuffed animals
on that wall.

28:44.593 --> 28:47.195
There's garbage bags
right over there.

28:48.064 --> 28:49.597
Don't you think you're overdoing
this a little bit?

28:49.632 --> 28:50.798
Lou:
Honey, I am waging war

28:50.833 --> 28:52.667
on these disgusting
little creatures

28:52.701 --> 28:55.903
that dare to be
in my daughter's hair.

28:55.970 --> 28:57.371
But you stripped our bed,
too.

28:57.406 --> 28:58.739
Yeah,
because she plays there.

28:58.806 --> 28:59.806
Honey, this is what
they recommend

28:59.841 --> 29:01.308
on the website.

29:01.343 --> 29:03.877
This is what you have to do
in this situation!

29:03.912 --> 29:05.346
Whoa! What did you put
in your hair?

29:05.380 --> 29:07.348
Ugh! I washed it in
this evil-smelling poison

29:07.382 --> 29:08.682
they recommended,

29:08.716 --> 29:10.117
and now I have to go do
Katie's hair...

29:10.152 --> 29:13.486
Oh, and you have
to do yours, too.

29:15.222 --> 29:16.356
(Birds chirp)

29:18.659 --> 29:20.060
(Crickets chirp)

29:24.532 --> 29:25.831
(Knock at the door)

29:28.569 --> 29:31.637
Are you going back
to the trailer tonight?

29:31.672 --> 29:32.805
Yeah, later,

29:32.839 --> 29:35.741
if the heater's
still workin'.

29:36.242 --> 29:37.743
You're okay,
right?

29:39.680 --> 29:40.980
I'm good.

29:42.282 --> 29:45.316
Talk about crazy
crossed signals, huh?

29:46.619 --> 29:48.486
Yeah, well,

29:48.520 --> 29:50.321
I'd like to get 'em uncrossed
if we can.

29:51.757 --> 29:53.058
Me too.

30:00.465 --> 30:03.934
Were you really gonna
propose to me that night?

30:04.002 --> 30:05.035
I was.

30:06.304 --> 30:08.938
And what made
you decide?

30:10.475 --> 30:12.275
I knew after
my bike accident

30:12.310 --> 30:15.579
that I wanted to spend
the rest of my life with you.

30:23.320 --> 30:27.256
You know how I said
I was waiting for the right time?

30:27.290 --> 30:29.725
Well, maybe that time
is now.

30:29.826 --> 30:31.927
Why don't we get married?

30:32.028 --> 30:34.230
I mean, really,
why not?

30:34.264 --> 30:36.632
I mean, what better time
is there than right now?!

30:38.267 --> 30:39.300
(Chuckles)

30:48.944 --> 30:50.445
What?

30:50.513 --> 30:53.214
Is that how
you're gonna ask me?

30:53.249 --> 30:56.783
Hey, Amy, why not?
Let's just get married, huh?

30:56.817 --> 30:57.851
What?

30:59.086 --> 31:01.588
Ty, it's supposed
to be a surprise.

31:01.623 --> 31:02.989
It's supposed to be romantic.

31:03.024 --> 31:04.258
It's supposed to be
one of those

31:04.292 --> 31:06.960
"take my breath away"
kind of moments.

31:07.028 --> 31:10.163
Um, well, okay,
what did you want me to say?

31:11.097 --> 31:13.499
Well,
I can't tell you that!

31:15.569 --> 31:18.604
<i>Oh, Ty,</i>
<i>you just don't get it!</i>

31:24.144 --> 31:25.844
Lou:
(Sighs) Poor Katie.

31:25.879 --> 31:28.046
She hated the smell
of that terrible lice shampoo

31:28.080 --> 31:31.015
and basically cried herself
to sleep.

31:31.050 --> 31:33.818
I'm itchy
just thinking about it.

31:35.521 --> 31:36.655
Are you okay?

31:38.191 --> 31:39.391
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>No.</i>

31:41.327 --> 31:43.027
Amy, listen,

31:43.627 --> 31:44.927
 I'm sorry.

31:46.164 --> 31:49.166
I'm sorry for everything.
(Pickup starts up outside)

31:49.201 --> 31:52.069
Amy: Me too.
(Pickup drives away)

31:52.136 --> 31:54.638
I was definitely not put on
this earth to keep secrets.

31:58.109 --> 31:59.509
Come here.

32:04.881 --> 32:06.782
Kendra: Hey, babies.
(Horses whinny)

32:06.850 --> 32:08.585
How are my big boys?

32:08.652 --> 32:10.953
(Horses snort in distress)

32:10.987 --> 32:12.488
Dinnertime.

32:12.523 --> 32:14.756
(Loud clatter)
Whoa! Whoa!

32:15.758 --> 32:16.825
Sky!

32:22.607 --> 32:26.242
<i>Lou:</i> <i>Okay. So, honey,</i>
<i>I have a meeting in one hour,</i>

32:26.277 --> 32:28.745
and, uh, you are gonna work
from home today

32:28.813 --> 32:29.913
and sit with Katie,
right?

32:29.948 --> 32:31.180
No, no,
Katie's going to daycare.

32:31.247 --> 32:33.483
What? No, honey.
No, she's not.

32:33.517 --> 32:37.186
Why not?
Because they closed the daycare.

32:37.220 --> 32:39.689
- Are you kidding me?
- No, honey, I told you.

32:39.723 --> 32:41.223
Look, I would've
taken her out anyway

32:41.291 --> 32:42.625
because that's where
she picked up head lice.

home and look after her, honey.

32:46.129 --> 32:47.863
I have a huge meeting today.
I can't do it.

32:47.930 --> 32:49.865
Yeah, but neither can I,
so...

32:56.506 --> 32:58.039
Go to work.
I'll...

32:58.073 --> 32:59.173
Yes. Thank you, Jack.
Thank you, Grandpa!

32:59.241 --> 33:00.942

33:12.237 --> 33:14.438
Hello,
my little Katie.

33:14.506 --> 33:16.206
Wow!
What is that smell?

33:16.274 --> 33:17.908
Lice shampoo.

33:19.243 --> 33:20.477
Lice?

33:20.511 --> 33:23.279
So how's it goin'
with your "deal"?

33:23.313 --> 33:25.415
Oh, I don't wanna talk
about that.

33:25.483 --> 33:26.516
Good.

33:27.485 --> 33:28.918

33:33.323 --> 33:35.023

Hello?

33:35.057 --> 33:38.627
Hi, Clint. Yeah. Yeah.
Oh, she's fine.

33:39.596 --> 33:41.497
What? Can it wait?

33:42.432 --> 33:45.901
All right. Okay.
I'll see you soon.

33:47.303 --> 33:48.837
That's Clint.

33:48.872 --> 33:51.472
There's another problem
with the foster parents.

33:51.507 --> 33:52.840
You have to watch

33:52.908 --> 33:54.975
Tim:
What? How?

33:55.043 --> 33:56.343

33:56.378 --> 33:58.413
You keep a sharp eye
on her.

Hey, hi.

Hi, sweetie.
What's goin' on?

34:57.001 --> 34:59.803
Oh! What does
she smell like?

34:59.838 --> 35:01.137
That's lice shampoo.

35:01.205 --> 35:03.039
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Ugh! Right.</i>

35:03.074 --> 35:05.709
Hey, Dad, do you know anything
about McSlade Farms?

35:05.777 --> 35:07.077
Do you know anything about

35:07.111 --> 35:08.912
how long you have to heat
this stuff?

35:08.980 --> 35:10.380
Um, just keep testing it.

35:10.414 --> 35:11.614
But I was looking
on the Internet

35:11.648 --> 35:13.215
and their website's
been wiped clean.

35:13.249 --> 35:15.618
Yeah, uh, well,
they're a big operation,

35:15.686 --> 35:18.253
<i>one of the top breeders.</i>

35:18.288 --> 35:20.923
Uh, Krendra and Joe McSlade.
They're good people.

35:20.958 --> 35:22.191
I haven't seen them
for a while.

35:22.225 --> 35:23.593
They kind of dropped
out of sight.

35:23.627 --> 35:25.394
Hmm.
(Microwave beeps)

35:25.428 --> 35:27.195
<i>Tim:</i> <i>Okay.

35:30.766 --> 35:32.567
How does she eat this?
What is this?

35:32.635 --> 35:33.602
No.

35:33.636 --> 35:37.071
Katie,
how about a banana?

35:37.106 --> 35:38.239
Amy:
(Laughs)

35:42.644 --> 35:46.179
I told you to stay away
from here.

35:46.247 --> 35:47.781
Amy: I think you're
missing something.

35:50.283 --> 35:52.752
I found him loose
in our yard again.

35:52.786 --> 35:55.555
(Snorts and paws ground)

35:55.589 --> 35:56.990
Why?

35:57.725 --> 35:59.559
Maybe that little brat
stole him again.

35:59.593 --> 36:01.861
Or maybe she didn't.

36:02.796 --> 36:04.430
He must have
got out somehow.

36:04.464 --> 36:06.765
Kendra, you've gotta see
that this is not right!

36:10.637 --> 36:13.739
It didn't used to be
like that in there.

36:13.840 --> 36:15.508
Joe was a stickler.

36:16.576 --> 36:18.477
He liked everything
just so.

36:18.512 --> 36:20.179
Your husband?

36:20.213 --> 36:22.081
He had a good eye.

36:22.149 --> 36:24.349
We bred quality horses.

36:25.384 --> 36:28.020
And then the recession hit

36:29.656 --> 36:33.759
and people stopped buying
expensive things.

36:33.793 --> 36:36.094
The recession hurt
a lot of people.

36:36.195 --> 36:38.229
Well, it killed Joe.

36:39.865 --> 36:42.433
The stress killed him.

36:42.500 --> 36:43.868
I'm sorry.

36:46.705 --> 36:49.006
Kendra,
you need help.

36:51.209 --> 36:52.710
You can't look after
all these horses properly

36:52.744 --> 36:53.711
on your own!

36:53.779 --> 36:55.912
These are my babies!

36:56.847 --> 36:58.147
What do you think?

36:58.182 --> 36:59.683
I should sell them
to the meat market?

36:59.750 --> 37:00.750
Is that the answer?

37:00.785 --> 37:02.852
No, that's not
the answer.

37:02.887 --> 37:04.454
These beautiful animals
wouldn't even have a home

37:04.488 --> 37:06.255
if it wasn't for me.

37:06.290 --> 37:08.524
They are top grade horses.

37:08.593 --> 37:11.159
Joe and I always deal
with top grade horses

37:11.227 --> 37:12.094
and I would never
part with them,

37:12.128 --> 37:13.929
do you understand?

37:13.964 --> 37:15.965
They are my life,

37:18.267 --> 37:20.469
and they remind me
of Joe.

37:21.370 --> 37:22.738
Okay?

37:23.439 --> 37:27.442
They make me feel like
he's still here.

37:27.477 --> 37:31.746
But I love them
with all my heart

37:31.814 --> 37:33.615
and they love me.

37:33.649 --> 37:37.319
Is that why Phoenix
keeps running away?

37:40.089 --> 37:43.057
These horses,
they need help.

37:44.025 --> 37:45.292
We could get them
some vet care

37:45.327 --> 37:46.494
and we could re-home
some of them -

37:46.528 --> 37:48.662
and not
to the meat truck!

37:48.696 --> 37:50.097
I could even take
some myself.

37:50.132 --> 37:51.965
Really.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.201
And what would you want
in return?

37:54.236 --> 37:56.570
A couple things.

37:56.605 --> 37:57.804
First, I want you
to get some help,

37:57.839 --> 37:59.372
and not just with
the horses.

37:59.406 --> 38:01.040
I don't need help!

38:01.074 --> 38:04.577
You know you're burying
yourself.

38:04.612 --> 38:06.712
Burying myself...

38:12.886 --> 38:14.720
I can't help it.

38:14.755 --> 38:17.556
Why don't you let me
help you?

38:18.525 --> 38:21.693

a couple of things.
