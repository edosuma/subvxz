Hawaii Five-O...

00:02.126 --> 00:03.201
Kono...

00:11.860 --> 00:13.660
You need to leave. Now.

00:13.662 --> 00:15.445
Adam...

00:15.447 --> 00:18.031
the guys who work for your
brother are gonna want payback.

00:18.033 --> 00:19.916
I'm going with you.

00:22.186 --> 00:24.988
Follow your heart.

00:24.990 --> 00:26.673
<i>I'll take good care of her.</i>

01:10.551 --> 01:12.118
Hey.

01:13.638 --> 01:15.739
Found a stream.

01:15.741 --> 01:17.457
It's packed with trout.

01:17.459 --> 01:20.793
It's a good thing, too, 'cause
we're gonna be here a while.

01:20.795 --> 01:22.429
I didn't know you fish.

01:22.431 --> 01:26.466
Yeah, in the...
"man versus nature" category

01:26.468 --> 01:30.403
of activities, I'd say fishing
ranks as my top two or three.

01:30.405 --> 01:31.921
Oh.

01:31.923 --> 01:33.073
You're lucky.

01:33.075 --> 01:35.808
My father never
let us fish.

01:35.810 --> 01:37.160
He said it was for peasants.

01:37.162 --> 01:39.329
Huh. Well, then I'm just
gonna have to teach you.

01:39.331 --> 01:41.698
Till then...

01:41.700 --> 01:44.317
I catch 'em,
you clean 'em.

01:44.319 --> 01:46.086
Deal.

01:47.755 --> 01:49.589
But you're doing the dishes.

01:49.591 --> 01:50.790
Nice try.

01:51.626 --> 01:52.842
Let me get cleaned up.

01:52.844 --> 01:54.778
All right.

02:01.619 --> 02:02.919
Hello?

02:02.921 --> 02:04.387
Kono, it's Chin.

02:04.389 --> 02:06.606
Listen to me very carefully.
There's been a security breach.

02:06.608 --> 02:07.840
Your location
has been compromised.

02:07.842 --> 02:09.508
By who?
The NLM.

02:09.511 --> 02:10.509
We believe they sold

02:10.512 --> 02:11.645
your location to the Yakuza.

02:11.647 --> 02:13.296
You and Adam need to get
out of there right now.

02:13.298 --> 02:14.280
Chin...

02:14.282 --> 02:15.815
Just do it, Kono! Go!

02:18.003 --> 02:19.452
Who was that?

02:19.454 --> 02:20.741
We need to leave. Now.

02:20.742 --> 02:21.534
What?

02:21.559 --> 02:23.474
Don't pack, don't take
anything, let's just go.

02:25.711 --> 02:27.627
What's going on?

02:52.003 --> 02:53.687
You all right?

02:53.689 --> 02:54.904
Yeah. You?

02:54.906 --> 02:56.489
Yeah. Let's go.

03:04.065 --> 03:05.915
Where are we going?

03:05.917 --> 03:07.417
Hell if I know.

Michael Maki?

04:17.805 --> 04:19.805
Welcome to Oahu,
Mr. Smith.

04:19.808 --> 04:21.991
Let me help you with that.

04:21.993 --> 04:23.443
Good flight?

04:23.445 --> 04:24.711
Not bad.

04:24.713 --> 04:26.696
You here for business
or pleasure?

04:26.698 --> 04:27.781
Little of both.

04:27.783 --> 04:29.315
Well, let's get
you to your hotel,

04:29.317 --> 04:31.668
so you can kick off those
boots and hit the beach.

04:31.670 --> 04:33.787
Car's right over here.

04:36.257 --> 04:38.324
Dispatch said you
asked for me by name.

04:38.326 --> 04:40.794
Have I met you before?

04:40.796 --> 04:43.162
I don't think I have...

04:43.164 --> 04:45.348
'cause I would remember
a guy like you.

04:59.331 --> 05:00.915
Play ball!

05:00.917 --> 05:02.550
Strike!

05:12.745 --> 05:14.462
Aw, come on.

05:18.268 --> 05:21.085
Batting ninth
for the Honolulu Shrimps,

05:21.087 --> 05:23.471
number seven, Grace Williams.

05:26.775 --> 05:28.676
Okay, baby, come on. Only
the good ones. Let's go.

05:28.678 --> 05:29.661
Okay, let's go, let's go!

05:29.663 --> 05:30.712
What do you
say, number seven?

05:30.714 --> 05:32.030
What do you say,
baby? Come on!

05:32.032 --> 05:34.148
Come on, Grace!
Batter up there, baby. Come on.

05:34.150 --> 05:35.950
Here we go, Sam.

05:35.952 --> 05:37.669
Straight down the middle.
Here we go.

05:41.707 --> 05:43.341
Strike!

05:43.343 --> 05:44.676
Good cut, baby, good
cut. Hey, Grace.

05:44.678 --> 05:45.910
Look at me.
Hands up,

05:45.912 --> 05:48.546
elbow up, sit down
on that back foot, okay?

05:48.548 --> 05:50.298
- Sit down a little bit, all right?
- No, no, no.

05:50.300 --> 05:51.766
Grace, Grace, listen to me.

05:51.768 --> 05:53.201
Bring your hands up
a couple of inches,

05:53.203 --> 05:55.303
drop your elbow, okay?

05:55.305 --> 05:56.688
All right,
here we go, Grace!

05:58.024 --> 05:59.173
Strike two!

05:59.175 --> 06:00.475
Nice!

06:02.228 --> 06:03.895
You, come here, please.
Time-out, please.

06:05.315 --> 06:06.648
Grace.

06:06.650 --> 06:07.866
Okay, listen.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.517
Um, we, uh, we love Uncle Steve

06:09.519 --> 06:10.985
very much, right?

06:10.987 --> 06:12.253
Okay, good.

06:12.255 --> 06:13.354
But he doesn't know
anything about baseball.

06:13.356 --> 06:14.472
So I want you to stop
listening to him,

06:14.474 --> 06:16.040
and I want you to
listen to me only.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.325
You understand?

06:17.327 --> 06:19.327
You gonna keep talking
or we gonna play some ball?

06:19.329 --> 06:20.562
All right, baby, come on.
Let's go. Swing away.

06:20.564 --> 06:22.330
Come on. Let's go.
Swing away.

06:22.332 --> 06:23.565
Throw the heat, Sam.

06:23.567 --> 06:24.999
She can't hit what
she can't see.

06:25.001 --> 06:26.818
Strike three!
There we go.

06:26.820 --> 06:27.919
You're out!
Come on.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.003
Yes!
Sorry, sistah.

06:29.005 --> 06:30.221
Hey, what are
you talking about?!

06:30.223 --> 06:31.339
In where... Hey.

06:31.341 --> 06:32.507
How was that a strike?

06:32.509 --> 06:33.925
In what world was
that a strike?

06:33.927 --> 06:35.042
Sorry, I call 'em

06:35.044 --> 06:36.094
like I see 'em, brah.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.061
Oh, yeah?

06:37.063 --> 06:38.046
Okay, good.
How about this?

06:38.048 --> 06:39.480
How about that?

06:39.482 --> 06:40.515
You see that?

06:40.517 --> 06:41.766
That's me kicking
dirt on your shoe.

06:41.768 --> 06:43.050
Do you see that?

06:43.052 --> 06:44.402
All right, guys,
remember we were

06:44.404 --> 06:45.436
talking about
sportsmanship?

06:45.438 --> 06:47.238
This right here,
that's not it.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.873
Huh? How about that?

06:48.875 --> 06:50.525
You... out of here!

06:50.527 --> 06:51.576
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:51.578 --> 06:52.777
Okay.

06:52.779 --> 06:54.078
Hold on, hold on,
hold on.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.546
Excuse me, excuse me.

06:55.548 --> 06:57.415
Um, Kame... whoa, whoa, whoa.
Look.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.700
I saw it, okay?

06:58.702 --> 07:00.885
This is peeweeeball;
you can't eject somebody.

07:00.887 --> 07:03.021
You... out of here, too!

07:03.023 --> 07:04.856
Two of you,
out of here!

07:05.859 --> 07:07.258
Hey, Coach, your
phone's ringing.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.426
Thanks, Johnny.

07:10.262 --> 07:12.196
McGarrett.

07:16.636 --> 07:18.886
C.O.D. appears to be
two close-contact gunshot wounds

07:18.888 --> 07:20.855
- to the back of the head.
- We get an I.D.?

07:20.857 --> 07:24.225
Uh, he doesn't appear to have
any identification on him.

07:24.227 --> 07:26.144
We know how long
he was in the water?

07:26.146 --> 07:27.996
Well, based on the
condition of his skin,

07:27.998 --> 07:30.598
I say no more than a few hours.

07:30.600 --> 07:32.600
Okay, my guess:
he was dumped from a boat,

07:32.602 --> 07:34.285
weighted down
with something heavy

07:34.287 --> 07:35.787
until the rope slipped off.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.288
Look at these linear abrasions

07:37.290 --> 07:38.873
on his wrists.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.675
They suggest that
the victim was tied up

07:40.677 --> 07:43.394
and unable to defend
himself while he sustained

07:43.396 --> 07:45.580
these facial injuries.

07:45.582 --> 07:46.798
and beat him
before they killed him.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.400
Max, let's get the prints
to the lab.

07:49.402 --> 07:50.601
See if we can work out
who this guy is

07:50.603 --> 07:52.620
and why it went down
the way it did.

07:52.622 --> 07:53.838
Commander.

07:53.840 --> 07:54.889
Yeah?

07:54.891 --> 07:56.457
Oh.

08:06.452 --> 08:08.636
Okay, thanks.

08:10.572 --> 08:12.106
You good?

08:12.108 --> 08:13.257
Ready?

08:13.259 --> 08:14.826
Let's go.

08:26.988 --> 08:29.407
What are you
looking at? What?

08:29.409 --> 08:30.675
What do you mean, "What?"

08:30.677 --> 08:32.493
You don't think I saw
that little handoff

08:32.495 --> 08:34.361
between you and Max?

08:40.019 --> 08:41.552
What is it?

08:41.554 --> 08:42.553
Read it.

08:42.554 --> 08:44.722
I'm gonna read it.

08:49.561 --> 08:54.399
You, uh... you had Max
run your DNA against Wo Fat?

08:56.486 --> 08:57.735
That's right.

08:57.737 --> 09:01.539
Why on earth would you do
something like that?

09:02.991 --> 09:04.709
Why... I would do
something like that,

09:04.711 --> 09:08.162
because I suspected
that we might be half brothers.

09:08.164 --> 09:10.581
You and Wo Fat?

09:11.968 --> 09:14.719
It's the only explanation
I could come up with, okay?

09:14.721 --> 09:16.637
Wo Fat-- he's a sociopath,

09:16.639 --> 09:19.891
he's a terrorist, he had my
father killed, yet my mother

09:19.893 --> 09:21.208
is protecting him.

09:21.210 --> 09:23.144
She's been protecting him
the whole time.

09:23.146 --> 09:25.063
Why would she do that?
I can't figure it out.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.982
But, uh, just so I'm clear,
you-you say he's a psychopath,

09:27.984 --> 09:29.300
he's-he's a sociopath,

09:29.302 --> 09:31.352
so you just automatically assume
you two are brothers.

09:31.354 --> 09:32.470
Makes sense to me.

09:32.472 --> 09:33.821
I got nothing else. I...
Give me something else.

09:33.823 --> 09:37.508
Well, this clearly states
that he is not your brother.

09:37.510 --> 09:39.660
So maybe your mother's
just trying to protect you.

09:39.662 --> 09:40.695
From what?

09:40.697 --> 09:43.081
Well, uh, the way I see it,

09:43.083 --> 09:46.134
this thing between you and
Wo Fat, it ends two... two ways.

09:46.136 --> 09:47.585
One of which, you are dead.

09:47.587 --> 09:50.588
Uh, so maybe your mother,
by visiting him in prison,

09:50.590 --> 09:51.989
she's trying to make peace.

09:51.991 --> 09:54.776
Maybe end the blood feud
before someone else gets hurt.

09:54.778 --> 09:56.410
No.
No.

09:56.412 --> 09:57.628
Not my mother.
Come on, you know Doris.

09:57.630 --> 09:58.679
She's up to something.

09:58.681 --> 09:59.947
She's up to something.

09:59.949 --> 10:01.749
I just wish to hell
I knew what it was.

10:13.980 --> 10:15.680
Okay, try it now.

10:18.067 --> 10:20.151
Come on.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.038
Yeah!

10:24.040 --> 10:25.289
Whoo!

10:25.291 --> 10:27.458
All right.

10:33.048 --> 10:34.799
Okay.

10:36.668 --> 10:38.419
Is there anything you can't do?

10:38.421 --> 10:40.221
Cook and clean.

10:40.223 --> 10:41.973
All right,
we're in trouble then,

10:41.975 --> 10:43.741
'cause that makes two of us.

10:43.743 --> 10:45.276
Oh, no.

10:45.278 --> 10:47.345
All right, let's
get out of here.

10:47.347 --> 10:50.765
You got a little,
uh... something.

10:53.603 --> 10:55.603
Okay, so where to?

10:58.640 --> 11:00.608
Hangchow.

11:00.610 --> 11:03.361
About a hundred miles.

11:03.363 --> 11:04.946
You think we'll be
safer in the city?

11:04.948 --> 11:06.080
I don't know.

11:06.082 --> 11:08.332
But it's got
the closest airport.

11:08.334 --> 11:10.084
So we're getting out of China?

11:10.086 --> 11:12.203
We're not.

11:12.205 --> 11:14.822
You are.

11:15.791 --> 11:18.042
Kono...

11:18.044 --> 11:20.211
you saw what happened
back there.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.296
My brother's army
will keep coming after us

11:22.298 --> 11:23.681
until we're dead.

11:24.666 --> 11:26.184
So we fight them off
like we did back...

11:26.186 --> 11:27.318
No, Kono.

11:27.320 --> 11:30.288
There's no way to win this.

11:32.007 --> 11:34.675
I'm not leaving you.

11:34.677 --> 11:36.176
I didn't come this
far to walk away...

11:36.178 --> 11:38.012
You're not listening to me.

11:38.014 --> 11:40.347
You stay with me,
we're both dead.

11:40.349 --> 11:41.649
It's just a matter of time.

11:41.651 --> 11:43.517
They'll find us sooner
than later.

11:43.519 --> 11:46.237
So we find them first.

11:47.873 --> 11:49.707
What are you saying?

11:49.709 --> 11:51.909
We hit them before they hit us.

11:51.911 --> 11:54.295
Hard.

11:54.297 --> 11:57.031
So they don't get up.

12:00.586 --> 12:03.588
I never liked playing defense.

12:11.680 --> 12:14.732
You're crazy, you know that?

12:19.321 --> 12:21.706
<i>- Whoa!</i>
<i>- Wow.</i>

12:21.708 --> 12:23.708
Look at this-- reunited.

12:23.710 --> 12:25.142
How's it feel, baby?
It feel good?

12:25.144 --> 12:27.645
Yeah, I.T. just
installed her.

12:27.647 --> 12:29.664
64-bit core processor.

12:29.666 --> 12:32.366
Next gen ultra HD
adjustable display.

12:32.368 --> 12:34.335
Floatware, voice command.

12:34.337 --> 12:35.419
Wow.

12:35.421 --> 12:36.904
That's great--
you two should get a room.

12:36.906 --> 12:38.556
You guys don't want
to give her a spin?

12:38.558 --> 12:40.207
No.

12:40.209 --> 12:41.408
Look, hey, if, uh,
it doesn't heat up a pizza,

12:41.410 --> 12:42.593
I got no use for it.

12:43.746 --> 12:45.880
Chin, did we get the I.D.
on the vic from the lab?

12:45.882 --> 12:47.782
Yeah, actually
it just came in.

12:47.784 --> 12:49.250
Guy's name is Michael Maki.

12:49.252 --> 12:50.685
As you can see,
he's got a rap sheet.

12:50.687 --> 12:52.252
Mostly drug offenses.

12:52.254 --> 12:54.538
Parole puts him as a driver

12:54.540 --> 12:56.057
for Pacific Isles Limousine.

12:56.059 --> 12:58.392
I reached out to the manager
there, who told me that Maki

12:58.394 --> 13:00.661
confirmed an airport pick-up
a few hours ago.

13:00.663 --> 13:04.298
Now, the client gave
his name as John Smith.

13:04.300 --> 13:06.717
And he requested Maki
to be his driver by name.

13:06.719 --> 13:07.952
Why would he do that?

13:07.954 --> 13:08.986
That's a very
good question

13:08.988 --> 13:10.604
considering the
limo company says

13:10.606 --> 13:12.723
that Smith is a
first-time customer.

13:12.725 --> 13:15.626
Now, Maki never checked in,
so the manager says

13:15.628 --> 13:17.328
that he tried to locate him
using the limo's GPS,

13:17.330 --> 13:20.298
but it was disabled once
they left the airport.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.500
Okay, well, uh, John Smith.

13:22.502 --> 13:25.836
We know our suspect
is very creative.

13:25.838 --> 13:27.054
Yeah, but he gets the job done.

13:27.056 --> 13:28.189
I mean, two shots

13:28.191 --> 13:29.340
to the back of the head,

13:29.342 --> 13:31.092
close range, on a parolee

13:31.094 --> 13:32.292
with a history of
drug trafficking.

13:32.294 --> 13:34.261
Body dump to cover
up the crime.

13:34.263 --> 13:35.629
I mean, this looks
like a hit to me.

13:35.631 --> 13:37.148
Yeah, I'll pull
the surveillance footage

13:37.150 --> 13:38.933
from the airport,

13:38.935 --> 13:41.235
both inside and out,
along with the flight manifests

13:41.237 --> 13:43.688
for arrivals around
the time of Maki's pick up.

13:43.690 --> 13:45.756
Let's see if we can't
find this Mr. Smith.

13:46.993 --> 13:49.026
Excuse me, gentlemen.

13:49.028 --> 13:51.195
Billy Harrington.
What are you doing here, man?

13:51.197 --> 13:53.664
How you doing?

13:53.666 --> 13:54.932
It's been a long time.

13:54.934 --> 13:57.001
Yeah, man, last time I saw you

13:57.003 --> 13:59.203
you were reassigned
to some classified op?

13:59.205 --> 14:03.323
Yeah, it was a hot extraction
out of North Korea.

14:05.043 --> 14:07.211
Right, that...
I'm sorry about that.

14:07.213 --> 14:09.163
No, no problem,
don't worry about it.

14:09.165 --> 14:12.166
Look, I'm-I'm sorry that I,
uh, dropped by like this,

14:12.168 --> 14:15.102
but I just needed to talk to you
and thought it was better

14:15.104 --> 14:16.354
if I did it in person.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.022
Yeah, of course.

14:18.024 --> 14:20.341
Come on in.

14:20.343 --> 14:24.145
What can I do for you, man?

14:24.147 --> 14:26.731
Well, I don't know if you heard,
but I cut away from the navy.

14:26.733 --> 14:28.783
Congratulations.

14:28.785 --> 14:30.701
What are you doing
for work?

14:30.703 --> 14:33.320
Uh, actually that's
why I'm here.

14:33.322 --> 14:34.372
Um...

14:34.374 --> 14:36.073
I'm starting a private
security firm.

14:36.075 --> 14:36.912
All right.

14:36.937 --> 14:38.910
And I wanted you to
hear it from me first

14:38.911 --> 14:42.113
that I offered Catherine

14:42.115 --> 14:44.865
a job running my
intel department.

14:44.867 --> 14:46.634
Sounds like a great opportunity

14:46.636 --> 14:49.203
if she was ready
to leave the navy.

14:51.339 --> 14:53.307
She didn't tell you, did she?

14:54.843 --> 14:57.344
Uh, no, she didn't.

14:57.346 --> 14:58.896
Me and my big mouth.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.014
Did she take the job?

15:00.016 --> 15:02.883
Actually no, she turned it down.

15:02.885 --> 15:04.435
She say why?

15:04.437 --> 15:06.137
No, but if I had to read
between the lines,

15:06.139 --> 15:08.823
I think that she's worried that
working with me might affect

15:08.825 --> 15:10.107
her relationship with you.

15:10.109 --> 15:12.743
Come on, man, look.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.745
I know you guys had a thing...

15:14.747 --> 15:16.030
Then you know it's over.

15:16.032 --> 15:17.448
And you know me,
we served together,

15:17.450 --> 15:19.750
I would never do anything to
get between the two of you.

15:21.236 --> 15:23.287
Come on, Steve.

15:23.289 --> 15:25.539
The only reason I'm here
is because Catherine is

15:25.541 --> 15:27.425
hands down the best
person for the job.

15:27.427 --> 15:28.709
I know that, look.

15:28.711 --> 15:31.295
She'd be an incredible asset
to any team.

15:32.597 --> 15:34.248
Let me talk to her.

15:34.250 --> 15:35.916
All right.
Hey.

15:35.918 --> 15:37.034
Hey.

15:37.036 --> 15:38.269
Come check this out.

15:38.271 --> 15:39.887
Are we good?

15:39.889 --> 15:41.105
We're good.
Thank you.

15:41.107 --> 15:42.189
I'll walk you out.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.475
So, this is footage

15:44.477 --> 15:45.693
from the arrivals terminal.

15:45.695 --> 15:49.096
Check out the cowboy.

15:50.215 --> 15:52.783
Now we lose him
for a minute here.

15:52.785 --> 15:55.169
Then we pick him up outside.

15:55.171 --> 15:57.354
Here.

16:02.577 --> 16:04.195
Chin, freeze that.

16:04.197 --> 16:06.413
Run facial rec.

16:18.810 --> 16:21.095
Our killer's a cop.

16:30.351 --> 16:32.152
This happened in '92.

16:32.154 --> 16:35.072
Ray Harper was a rookie
cashing his first paycheck

16:35.074 --> 16:36.273
as a ranger.

16:36.275 --> 16:37.691
Hell of a way
to start to a career.

16:37.693 --> 16:39.226
Oh, it gets better.

16:39.228 --> 16:41.495
Harper ended up becoming one
of the most decorated officers

16:41.497 --> 16:43.530
in the history
of the Ranger Division.

16:43.532 --> 16:44.581
Okay, tell me this.

16:44.583 --> 16:45.566
Why would a hero

16:45.568 --> 16:47.084
travel all the
way to Hawaii

16:47.086 --> 16:48.836
just to murder
a limo driver?

16:48.838 --> 16:49.987
Maybe our victim

16:49.989 --> 16:52.089
is part of a case
that Harper was working.

16:52.091 --> 16:53.123
I thought that, too,

16:53.125 --> 16:54.675
but then I spoke
to his commander.

16:54.677 --> 16:56.593
Harper was injured in a
shoot-out a little while ago.

16:56.595 --> 16:58.595
He was riding a desk
for six months.

16:58.597 --> 16:59.913
He's supposed to
be on vacation.

16:59.915 --> 17:01.265
Nothing says R and R

17:01.267 --> 17:02.533
like whacking
somebody out, right?

17:02.535 --> 17:04.584
Yeah, flagged him
with Homeland Security.

17:04.586 --> 17:06.854
Neither Harper
nor his alias has shown up

17:06.856 --> 17:09.406
in any passenger manifests
leaving the island.

17:09.407 --> 17:12.092
Okay, uh, Harper comes here
to kill Maki.

17:12.094 --> 17:14.094
He's already done that.
What's he still doing here?

17:14.945 --> 17:17.330
Maybe he's not finished.

17:24.289 --> 17:27.440
Now is that any way
to welcome a man into your home?

17:27.442 --> 17:28.659
Who are you?

17:28.661 --> 17:29.793
What do you want?

17:29.795 --> 17:33.614
I'm just, uh, looking
for a guy and a girl.

17:33.616 --> 17:35.749
I'm told you know
where I can find them.

17:36.784 --> 17:39.419
I don't know
what you're talking about.

17:39.421 --> 17:40.470
Yeah, you do.

17:40.472 --> 17:41.838
Michael Maki says you do.

17:41.840 --> 17:43.090
Who?

17:43.925 --> 17:45.292
Okay.

17:45.294 --> 17:47.460
You want to play that game?

17:54.819 --> 17:56.687
What the hell do you want, man?

18:00.641 --> 18:03.777
I prefer chunky,
but this'll do.

18:04.896 --> 18:06.730
Everything all right?

18:06.732 --> 18:08.031
Yeah, everything's fine.

18:08.033 --> 18:09.633
I heard Billy stopped by.

18:09.635 --> 18:12.169
Billy did stop by.

18:12.171 --> 18:13.537
About that...
Yeah, listen.

18:13.539 --> 18:15.072
The only reason I didn't
say anything to you

18:15.074 --> 18:18.375
about leaving the navy
was because I wasn't sure.

18:18.377 --> 18:22.179
And-and that was a decision
that I had to make on my own.

18:23.548 --> 18:25.482
On your own or with Billy?

18:25.484 --> 18:26.717
Okay, no, listen.

18:26.719 --> 18:28.552
My C.O. told him
that I was thinking

18:28.554 --> 18:30.604
about resigning
my commission.

18:30.606 --> 18:32.022
I haven't even submitted
my letter yet.

18:32.024 --> 18:34.491
So you're actually
serious about this.

18:35.493 --> 18:38.412
I've spent half my life
in the navy, Steve.

18:38.414 --> 18:41.231
It's like I need to start
thinking about what's next.

18:41.233 --> 18:43.350
All right, so why would you, uh,

18:43.352 --> 18:45.819
why would you turn down
the job with Billy?

18:47.622 --> 18:49.706
Not right for me.
Catherine,

18:49.708 --> 18:51.524
it's tailor-made for you--
recon and surveillance,

18:51.526 --> 18:52.960
risk assessment,
protection services?

18:52.962 --> 18:54.845
Please.

18:54.847 --> 18:57.748
Why would you say no?

18:59.533 --> 19:01.969
Because I'm really
happy right now.

19:01.971 --> 19:04.204
I mean, things are
good between us.

19:04.206 --> 19:05.389
And I don't want a job--

19:05.391 --> 19:07.391
even if it's the
perfect job--

19:07.393 --> 19:10.177
to get in the way of that.

19:12.146 --> 19:13.930
Steve?

19:13.932 --> 19:16.533
HPD just found Maki's limo
parked outside a house

19:16.535 --> 19:17.684
in Waipahu.

19:17.686 --> 19:19.186
Excuse me.

19:19.188 --> 19:21.088
Okay, tell HPD
to secure the perimeter.

19:21.090 --> 19:22.055
No exits, no entries.

19:22.057 --> 19:23.407
We're on the way.
All right.

19:23.409 --> 19:24.891
I'm sorry.

19:30.031 --> 19:32.749
I'm gonna miss seeing you
in those cammies.

19:34.535 --> 19:35.786
I got to go.

19:35.788 --> 19:37.421
Yeah.

19:43.946 --> 19:46.763
Look at this.

19:46.765 --> 19:48.298
Look what arrived.

19:48.300 --> 19:50.250
Beautiful, huh?

19:50.252 --> 19:51.551
Looks nice.

19:51.553 --> 19:52.552
What are you doing?

19:52.554 --> 19:53.753
Let's go.

20:00.713 --> 20:02.929
That sounds good.

20:07.268 --> 20:08.952
You're not gonna let me
drive my new car?

20:14.042 --> 20:16.243
You're a real jerk,
you know that?

20:23.634 --> 20:25.218
You're grinding the thing.
I'm not grinding the thing.

20:25.220 --> 20:26.636
Would you please...?
What are you talking about?

20:26.638 --> 20:28.672
This thing is an animal.
Let me tell you about...

20:28.674 --> 20:30.790
Zero to 60 in under five.

20:30.792 --> 20:32.893
Under five, okay?
Mm-hmm.

20:32.895 --> 20:34.010
Corners like it's stuck
to the road.

20:34.012 --> 20:35.762
It's a dream. I love this car.

20:35.764 --> 20:37.347
Are you enjoying yourself?

20:37.349 --> 20:38.899
I am. I am.

20:38.901 --> 20:40.067
Good.

20:40.069 --> 20:42.319
Are you enjoying yourself
as much as you enjoyed

20:42.321 --> 20:45.605
having that conversation with
your girlfriend's ex-boyfriend?

20:47.141 --> 20:48.575
What are you talking about?
Billy's...

20:48.577 --> 20:51.695
Billy's opening a private
security firm, okay?

20:51.697 --> 20:52.996
He heard Catherine was
leaving the navy.

20:52.998 --> 20:55.031
He wants to offer her a job.

20:55.033 --> 20:56.316
Came to me out of respect

20:56.318 --> 20:57.501
to make sure it was okay.

20:57.503 --> 20:58.702
Aha!

20:58.704 --> 21:02.622
Okay, well, uh, I'm gonna
just take a stab here.

21:02.624 --> 21:04.791
Did he tell you that, uh,
offering her the job

21:04.793 --> 21:07.660
has nothing to do
with their past relationship,

21:07.662 --> 21:09.096
all due respect to you,

21:09.098 --> 21:11.264
and that she-she's the only
person for the position?

21:11.266 --> 21:14.834
Yes, that's actually
exactly what he said.

21:14.836 --> 21:16.303
Ha, that's funny.

21:16.305 --> 21:18.438
Did he also say that you should
convince her to take the job?

21:18.440 --> 21:19.606
Which, by the way

21:19.608 --> 21:21.308
is a terrible idea.
Wait-wait, stop, stop.

21:21.310 --> 21:22.509
Okay.
Billy's a solid guy.

21:22.511 --> 21:24.861
"Guy" being the
operative word here.

21:24.863 --> 21:26.279
The guy who is gonna be working

21:26.281 --> 21:29.116
long, hard hours
with your beautiful,

21:29.118 --> 21:32.685
intelligent, sexy,
attractive girlfriend.

21:32.687 --> 21:34.154
Danny, Billy and I
served together.

21:34.156 --> 21:35.872
We saw action together.

21:35.874 --> 21:38.158
He's all about integrity
and character.

21:38.160 --> 21:39.626
That is exactly why
it is a terrible idea.

21:39.628 --> 21:40.961
That doesn't
make any sense.

21:40.963 --> 21:43.380
You see, that is why you will
never see it coming, pal.

21:43.382 --> 21:45.532
You are complacent, okay?

21:45.534 --> 21:47.918
You need to fortify
your position.

21:47.920 --> 21:49.586
At all times, at all times,

21:49.588 --> 21:51.054
you need to protect your queen

21:51.056 --> 21:53.006
like, uh, chess.

21:53.008 --> 21:54.341
No, not like in chess, Danny.

21:54.343 --> 21:56.259
In chess, the queen
is a fighting piece,

21:56.261 --> 21:58.178
and you use her
to protect the king.

21:58.180 --> 21:59.546
What are you talking about?
Okay, okay.

21:59.548 --> 22:01.681
It was a metaphor.
It was a metaphor for you losing

22:01.683 --> 22:03.099
the best thing
that ever happened to you.

22:03.101 --> 22:04.651
There's nothing to worry about.

22:04.653 --> 22:06.236
Catherine, she turned
the job down.

22:06.238 --> 22:09.722
Good. Her decision?
Yeah, I told her to take the job.

22:09.724 --> 22:10.774
Very good.
Her decision.

22:10.776 --> 22:12.225
Makes you look like
the confident,

22:12.227 --> 22:14.611
understanding, boyfriend.
Everything is good.

22:14.613 --> 22:17.214
All right.

22:17.216 --> 22:18.748
She's gonna need a job, Danny.

22:18.750 --> 22:20.733
We'll get her a job!
You know, there's got to be

22:20.735 --> 22:23.420
a testosterone-free workplace
somewhere on this island.

22:23.422 --> 22:24.504
I mean, we'll get her

22:24.506 --> 22:26.790
a job at a convent,
nice women's charity,

22:26.792 --> 22:28.091
sell donuts, I don't know.
Something.

22:28.093 --> 22:29.742
The point is, it is good

22:29.744 --> 22:32.179
that she did not take
that job, trust me.

22:32.181 --> 22:35.098
Trust me. As a friend,
I know these things.

22:44.775 --> 22:46.059
Duke.

22:48.396 --> 22:50.914
No one's been in
or out since we got here.

22:50.916 --> 22:52.399
That's Maki's limo.

22:52.401 --> 22:53.984
We know who owns
this place?

22:53.986 --> 22:54.985
It's a rental.

22:54.987 --> 22:56.953
Name on the lease
is Tom Akuna.

22:56.955 --> 22:59.272
He has priors for drugs
and assault with a firearm.

22:59.274 --> 23:01.625
No known association
with our suspect Harper.

23:01.627 --> 23:03.793
Okay, let's go.

23:20.628 --> 23:21.811
Clear.

23:21.813 --> 23:22.812
I'm clear.

23:22.814 --> 23:24.648
Clear.

23:27.735 --> 23:29.185
I got fresh blood.

23:29.187 --> 23:31.137
All right, well, if
Harper killed Akuna,

23:31.139 --> 23:34.307
then where is the body?

23:34.309 --> 23:35.609
I got at least 75K here.

23:35.611 --> 23:38.845
Ah, so he was obviously
after the money.

23:38.847 --> 23:40.813
All right, Harper left the limo
here, which means

23:40.815 --> 23:42.282
he's gotta be driving
Akuna's car, right?

23:42.284 --> 23:43.867
Chin, find out what that is,

23:43.869 --> 23:45.051
get an APB out.

23:45.053 --> 23:47.320
We find that car,
we find our killer.

24:06.575 --> 24:09.426
You're dead!
You hear me?

24:09.428 --> 24:11.778
You son of a bitch!
You're a dead man!

24:11.780 --> 24:14.514
You don't know
who you're dealing with.

24:17.017 --> 24:19.069
You were born here,
right?

24:19.071 --> 24:20.370
What's it to you?

24:20.372 --> 24:22.072
I was making
small talk.

24:22.074 --> 24:24.658
It took me ten hours
and two planes to get here.

24:24.660 --> 24:26.660
Not a whole hell of a t
lo do

24:26.662 --> 24:29.079
sitting in a tin can
at 30,000 feet.

24:29.081 --> 24:30.614
Of course,
there's movies,

24:30.616 --> 24:32.882
but for my money, they haven't
made a good one since <i>Godfather.</i>

24:32.884 --> 24:34.701
<i>Godfather?</i>

24:34.703 --> 24:36.369
Arguably,
<i>Part II</i> was a better movie,

24:36.371 --> 24:37.837
but that's just a matter
of taste.

24:37.839 --> 24:40.557
What the hell are you doing?!

24:40.559 --> 24:42.225
You ever read those in-flight
magazines, Tom?

24:42.227 --> 24:45.028
You know, the ones they stick
behind the seat with the vomit bags?

24:45.030 --> 24:47.330
Most people don't pay
much mind.

24:47.332 --> 24:49.733
They're too busy listening to music
or watching the aforementioned crap

24:49.735 --> 24:51.468
that passes
for entertainment.

24:51.470 --> 24:54.321
Me? Call me old-fashioned,
but I'm a reader.

24:54.323 --> 24:56.439
I'll read anything
you put in front of me.

24:56.441 --> 24:59.509
And those in-flight magazines,
they're good reading.

24:59.511 --> 25:02.429
For instance,
there was this one story

25:02.431 --> 25:04.864
about the rat population
on this island.

25:04.866 --> 25:08.901
Seems that those nasty little
rodents just ruined

25:08.903 --> 25:10.286
the sugarcane crop.

25:10.288 --> 25:14.007
Then about a hundred years ago
some genius decided

25:14.009 --> 25:18.178
to import Indian mongoose
from Jamaica

25:18.180 --> 25:19.713
to exterminate those rats.

25:19.715 --> 25:24.234
Now, on the surface, that seemed
like a hell of a good plan,

25:24.236 --> 25:26.853
'cause the mongoose
is a natural predator of the rat,

25:26.855 --> 25:28.888
but what our well-intentioned
friend didn't understand was

25:28.890 --> 25:31.924
that this particular species
of rat is nocturnal.

25:31.926 --> 25:34.044
Which means they're active
at night.

25:34.046 --> 25:37.280
Whereas the mongoose
is diurnal.

25:38.499 --> 25:40.784
Yeah, yeah, I had to look
that one up, too.

25:40.786 --> 25:42.935
It means they're
a daytime creature.

25:42.937 --> 25:47.940
So, as you can imagine,
those rats to this very day

25:47.942 --> 25:49.942
are running around these
fields all night long.

25:49.944 --> 25:54.848
And you know what they like
even more than sugarcane?

25:54.850 --> 25:57.801
I'll give you one guess.

25:57.803 --> 25:59.769
Hey, you can't do this to me.

25:59.771 --> 26:01.388
You hear me?!

26:01.390 --> 26:03.006
Seems to me it's already done.

26:03.008 --> 26:06.259
If you don't mind,
I'm gonna hit the road.

26:06.261 --> 26:08.311
When it comes to rats,
I'm a little squeamish.

26:08.313 --> 26:10.563
Hey, you can't do this
to me! You hear me?!

26:12.566 --> 26:14.967
Okay, all right.

26:16.804 --> 26:19.622
Those two you're looking for,
I know where they are.

26:47.968 --> 26:49.302
Where is she?!

26:50.521 --> 26:52.439
Start talking,

26:52.441 --> 26:55.225
or so help me God,
I'll put a bullet in your face.

26:55.227 --> 26:56.676
Hey! Five-O!
Drop the gun.

26:56.678 --> 26:57.861
Drop the gun
right now.

26:57.863 --> 26:59.562
Come back later.

26:59.564 --> 27:01.247
It's over, Ray.

27:01.249 --> 27:02.398
Put down the gun. Come on.

27:02.400 --> 27:04.567
I'm about to question
this young man

27:04.569 --> 27:05.852
on a very pressing matter.

27:05.854 --> 27:07.987
I'm not gonna let you stop
me from doing that.

27:07.989 --> 27:09.405
I'm about to shoot you
in the back of the head

27:09.407 --> 27:11.207
if you don't put
that gun down, Ray.

27:12.376 --> 27:14.961
I'm guessing you gentlemen
are packing nines,

27:14.963 --> 27:16.663
which means you have plenty
of firepower.

27:16.665 --> 27:19.031
The question is, how fast
are you on the trigger?

27:19.033 --> 27:21.968
Me, I got a simple
six-shot Colt,

27:21.970 --> 27:25.037
but I'm quick
and I'm one hell of a shot.

27:25.039 --> 27:27.707
Chances are, we tangle,
one of you is going down.

27:27.709 --> 27:30.543
I wouldn't bet on that.

27:46.026 --> 27:47.443
Put the gun down.

27:52.566 --> 27:54.584
You're making a big mistake.

27:54.953 --> 27:56.454
Uh, huh.

28:08.828 --> 28:11.361
You know, Michael Maki's body

28:11.363 --> 28:13.214
washing up on that beach
like that?

28:13.216 --> 28:15.365
That was shoddy work, Ray.

28:15.367 --> 28:17.301
It was very disappointing
for a man

28:17.303 --> 28:20.855
who is supposed to know
how to cover his tracks.

28:20.857 --> 28:22.873
I mean, you disabled
the GPS in the limo,

28:22.875 --> 28:24.842
but you missed the tracking
system on Akuna's car.

28:24.844 --> 28:27.261
What's the matter
with you, Ray?

28:27.263 --> 28:30.247
You might as well have sent us
an invite to the kid's hotel room.

28:30.249 --> 28:35.269
Tell me, were you gonna kill
that kid like you killed Maki?

28:35.271 --> 28:37.471
I didn't kill Maki.

28:37.473 --> 28:39.723
And I suppose you didn't kill
Akuna either.

28:39.725 --> 28:41.058
That's right.

28:41.060 --> 28:43.260
Then why don't you tell me
where he is then?

28:43.262 --> 28:45.729
<i>All right, Carl, maybe, uh,</i>

28:45.731 --> 28:47.414
maybe you could help
me out with something.

28:47.416 --> 28:49.200
I got, uh, I got seven
unsolved robberies

28:49.202 --> 28:52.386
the last 24 hours,
all over town.

28:52.388 --> 28:57.424
Our suspect is a white male,
black ski mask,

28:57.426 --> 28:59.193
uh, silver gun.

28:59.195 --> 29:02.963
Total take, about six
grand in small bills.

29:02.965 --> 29:06.717
What, uh, what can you tell me?

29:11.890 --> 29:13.357
Okay, explain something to me.

29:13.359 --> 29:17.928
Why is it that a kid
with no record till today

29:17.930 --> 29:21.982
would travel 4,000
miles to Oahu

29:21.984 --> 29:24.568
to, uh... commit a bunch

29:24.570 --> 29:26.704
of silly-ass stickups?

29:26.706 --> 29:28.455
What, they don't have
convenience stores

29:28.457 --> 29:30.457
in San Antonio?

29:30.459 --> 29:32.660
It's-it's not what you think.

29:32.662 --> 29:34.328
Okay, well, then
enlighten me, please.

29:34.330 --> 29:36.947
And start by telling me
how you know Ray Harper,

29:36.949 --> 29:39.667
and why would he put
a gun in your face?

29:43.955 --> 29:45.639
No?

29:47.092 --> 29:48.726
Who's that?

29:53.682 --> 29:56.150
Hmm? Nobody?

29:57.802 --> 29:59.103
Who is it?

30:00.338 --> 30:02.940
See, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go out
on a limb here

30:02.942 --> 30:05.442
and say that you-you care
a lot about this girl, okay,

30:05.444 --> 30:08.645
'cause the smile on your face
right here is a lot different

30:08.647 --> 30:11.832
than the look you got
on your face right now.

30:11.834 --> 30:13.534
I know something is going on,

30:13.536 --> 30:15.202
and know that it's a lot bigger

30:15.204 --> 30:16.920
than these goofy
little stickups, okay?

30:16.922 --> 30:21.375
So tell me what it is,
and I will help you, I promise.

30:30.885 --> 30:32.502
Okay, so my guy's not
saying anything,

30:32.504 --> 30:33.554
but he's got a friend.

30:33.556 --> 30:35.505
I'm thinking we can
get to her,

30:35.507 --> 30:37.641
we could maybe
get some answers.

30:49.187 --> 30:51.238
Who is she?

30:51.240 --> 30:54.208
Who is she, Ray?

30:59.431 --> 31:01.699
It's the same girl, Ray.
Who is she?

31:01.701 --> 31:04.835
Is this your daughter?

31:06.838 --> 31:08.222
Is she your daughter?

31:08.224 --> 31:11.175
Her name is Amanda,
and she's not just my daughter.

31:12.811 --> 31:14.895
She's my life.

31:16.898 --> 31:19.316
Okay, well, do Amanda a favor

31:19.318 --> 31:20.567
and trust us
on this, okay?

31:20.569 --> 31:22.219
You need to tell us.
Where is she?

31:22.221 --> 31:23.237
Is she in trouble?

31:23.239 --> 31:24.254
I don't know.

31:24.256 --> 31:25.939
Couldn't find her.

31:25.941 --> 31:28.725
That kid you stopped me from
questioning knows where she is.

31:31.079 --> 31:34.231
Carl, you have
five seconds, okay?

31:34.233 --> 31:36.200
Five seconds to tell
me where Amanda is

31:36.202 --> 31:38.535
or I'm gonna let her
father come in here

31:38.537 --> 31:40.254
and ask you himself,
and I promise you,

31:40.256 --> 31:43.040
he's not gonna be as polite
as me, okay?

31:44.959 --> 31:47.878
Look, I-I-I don't know where
she is. I swear.

31:47.880 --> 31:50.414
This whole thing just got
way out of hand.

31:50.416 --> 31:51.932
What whole thing?

31:53.969 --> 31:55.585
I got involved with some guys

31:55.587 --> 31:57.855
that I went to school with
back in San Antonio.

31:57.857 --> 31:59.556
They offered me two grand,
a limo

31:59.558 --> 32:00.607
and a couple plane tickets.

32:00.609 --> 32:03.093
All I had to do
was take a bag of cash

32:03.095 --> 32:05.896
out to some of their friends
in North Shore.

32:05.898 --> 32:07.097
And they told me

32:07.099 --> 32:09.483
to bring a girl because
it would be less suspicious.

32:09.485 --> 32:12.436
Amanda, she didn't know anything
about any of this.

32:12.438 --> 32:14.071
Okay, how much cash?

32:14.073 --> 32:15.606
$75,000.

32:15.608 --> 32:17.408
Did you make the delivery?

32:17.410 --> 32:18.792
No, no.
We got robbed on the way.

32:18.794 --> 32:22.246
Some guy in a ski mask
jacked us at a stoplight.

32:23.465 --> 32:28.051
Okay, well, either they are the
luckiest thieves on planet Earth

32:28.053 --> 32:29.953
or you were set up.

32:29.955 --> 32:31.922
That kid wasn't even on
my radar.

32:31.924 --> 32:35.342
Amanda doesn't talk to me
about boys.

32:35.344 --> 32:37.261
What about
Amanda's mother?

32:37.263 --> 32:39.563
She took off
when Amanda was three.

32:39.565 --> 32:42.816
I've been raising her on my own
ever since.

32:42.818 --> 32:46.353
About two weeks ago,
Amanda started begging me

32:46.355 --> 32:48.589
to let her go on a trip
to Hawaii

32:48.591 --> 32:50.007
with a girlfriend's family.

32:50.009 --> 32:51.825
She's a good kid, she's
never been in trouble.

32:51.827 --> 32:53.377
I had no reason
not to trust her.

32:53.379 --> 32:56.313
I told her to call me
when she got settled.

33:01.120 --> 33:02.652
She never did.

33:02.654 --> 33:04.321
She wouldn't go 24 hours
without calling me.

33:04.323 --> 33:06.323
It's just not the way
she was raised.

33:06.325 --> 33:08.542
I tried her phone,

33:08.544 --> 33:10.627
but every time I called, it
went straight to voice mail,

33:10.629 --> 33:11.929
so I did some digging.

33:11.931 --> 33:13.247
Found out she
didn't go with her girlfriend,

33:13.249 --> 33:15.265
she went with
this Jacobson kid.

33:15.267 --> 33:16.850
And I followed
his trail.

33:18.169 --> 33:20.003
Okay, so that's how
you found Michael Maki.

33:20.005 --> 33:22.506
With a little
Texas charm,

33:22.508 --> 33:23.840
he told me he
picked the kids up.

33:23.842 --> 33:25.592
They were supposed to
drop off a bag of money

33:25.594 --> 33:26.727
when they
got robbed.

33:26.729 --> 33:27.794
Then he
drove 'em

33:27.796 --> 33:29.112
to this middleman
Akuna's house

33:29.114 --> 33:30.264
to figure out
what to do.

33:30.266 --> 33:32.449
Well, so who
killed Maki?

33:32.451 --> 33:34.151
I don't know.

33:34.153 --> 33:36.487
When I left him,
he was hurting,

33:36.489 --> 33:37.654
but very much alive.

33:37.656 --> 33:38.872
Well, what about Akuna?

33:38.874 --> 33:40.190
I cut him loose

33:40.192 --> 33:42.426
ce he pointed me
towards Jacobson.

33:42.428 --> 33:43.961
This guy Akuna

33:43.963 --> 33:45.796
sent me to...
to meet his boss.

33:45.798 --> 33:47.531
He told me if
I told his boss everything,

33:47.533 --> 33:49.550
he sh-should understand.

33:49.552 --> 33:52.152
Let me guess:
he didn't understand.

33:53.988 --> 33:55.455
No.

33:55.457 --> 33:56.890
<i>Why would you not</i>

33:56.892 --> 33:58.141
come to us in
the beginning, Ray?

33:58.143 --> 33:59.142
No offense,

33:59.144 --> 34:00.727
but I don't know you.

34:00.729 --> 34:03.397
Which means
I don't trust you.

34:03.399 --> 34:04.765
When I looked into this,

34:04.767 --> 34:06.233
I realized Amanda
could be in some trouble

34:06.235 --> 34:07.901
with some real players.

34:07.903 --> 34:10.504
I wouldn't put her life
in your hands or anyone else's.

34:17.195 --> 34:18.195
Ballistics came back
on the bullets

34:18.197 --> 34:19.896
Max pulled from
Maki's skull.

34:19.898 --> 34:21.498
They're not a match
to Ray's Colt.

34:23.333 --> 34:25.536
All right, so Ray's
telling the truth.

34:27.005 --> 34:28.871
Okay, uh, the
kid messed up.

34:28.873 --> 34:30.424
The guys that he was supposed
to deliver the money to,

34:30.426 --> 34:31.625
they have Amanda.

34:31.627 --> 34:33.677
If they don't get the
money in 48 hours,

34:33.679 --> 34:35.212
they are going
to kill her.

34:45.106 --> 34:46.857
What are you doing?

34:48.976 --> 34:50.561
Let's go find
your daughter.

35:15.620 --> 35:16.887
Hey!

35:16.889 --> 35:18.755
Don't move.
Don't move!

35:18.757 --> 35:19.956
Turn the water off.

35:23.645 --> 35:24.928
You set those kids up.

35:24.930 --> 35:26.096
Maki told you
about the money drop,

35:26.098 --> 35:27.578
you two figured
it'd be an easy score.

35:29.350 --> 35:30.767
Who killed Maki?

35:32.103 --> 35:33.637
The guys that
we work for.

35:33.639 --> 35:35.606
That's a smart move,
ripping off your bosses.

35:35.608 --> 35:37.491
Right, they know it
was an inside job.

35:37.493 --> 35:38.659
They don't know
we took their cash.

35:38.661 --> 35:40.010
Maki's dead

35:40.012 --> 35:41.978
because they found out
he talked to a cop.

35:41.980 --> 35:43.397
Which makes you
their next victim.

35:43.399 --> 35:45.616
Oh...

35:46.534 --> 35:48.785
You guys have
to take me with you, yeah?

35:48.787 --> 35:50.203
You want my
protection?

35:50.205 --> 35:51.672
Why don't you tell me
where Amanda is?

35:51.674 --> 35:54.374
She's not with Carl.
Where is she?

35:54.376 --> 35:56.660
I'm not gonna
ask you again.

35:57.795 --> 36:00.764
So according to Akuna,

36:00.766 --> 36:01.882
Amanda's probably being held

36:01.884 --> 36:04.384
in one of the upstairs bedrooms
in this house.

36:04.386 --> 36:05.802
Okay, look.

36:05.804 --> 36:07.003
It's really simple.

36:07.005 --> 36:08.088
You're gonna go in
there-- look at me--

36:08.090 --> 36:09.239
give 'em the money,

36:09.241 --> 36:10.957
get Amanda back, get
the hell out of there.

36:10.959 --> 36:12.025
Make sense?

36:12.027 --> 36:14.027
I'm gonna need
a "yes" or "no""

36:14.029 --> 36:16.029
Uh, I think so.

36:16.031 --> 36:17.847
That'll do.

36:17.849 --> 36:18.815
All right, Carl.

36:18.817 --> 36:19.816
It's go time, buddy.
Saddle up.

36:19.818 --> 36:21.702
"Saddle up"? Really?

36:21.704 --> 36:24.037
Thought it was
appropriate.

36:27.291 --> 36:28.775
Relax, Carl. You can do this.

36:28.777 --> 36:31.378
Okay?
Everything's going to be fine.

36:47.612 --> 36:49.479
I don't want any trouble.

36:49.481 --> 36:50.664
I'm just here for Amanda.

36:50.666 --> 36:53.483
I... I have the money.
It's all right here.

36:55.937 --> 36:57.738
Whoa. Hey, wait!

36:57.740 --> 36:58.972
Wait... wait, hey,

36:58.974 --> 37:01.191
what are you doing?
Hey, you-you said if I...

37:01.193 --> 37:02.509
if I brought you the money...

37:02.511 --> 37:03.810
I have all the money,
it's right here.

37:03.812 --> 37:04.828
Now, where's... where's Amanda?

37:04.830 --> 37:06.029
Change of plans.

37:06.031 --> 37:07.531
What... what do you mean,

37:07.533 --> 37:09.783
change of plans?
Where's Amanda?

37:11.502 --> 37:12.602
I got a better deal.

37:12.604 --> 37:14.571
I sold her.

37:21.106 --> 37:23.224
Whoa.

37:24.443 --> 37:26.144
Hey! No, no, please!

37:26.146 --> 37:28.029
I did what you asked!

37:53.356 --> 37:55.440
Where's my daughter?

38:00.412 --> 38:02.613
Come on, let's go.

38:05.150 --> 38:06.150
Let's go!

38:06.152 --> 38:08.703
Come on, come on.
let's go.

38:10.506 --> 38:11.889
Come on, man, let's go!

38:37.700 --> 38:39.600
Hey, stupid.

39:56.895 --> 39:58.429
Amanda?

39:58.431 --> 39:59.931
Daddy!

39:59.933 --> 40:01.766
Amanda!
Hold on, baby!

40:03.769 --> 40:05.103
Daddy!

40:05.105 --> 40:06.354
Amanda.

40:06.356 --> 40:08.656
Daddy, Daddy.

40:08.658 --> 40:10.241
I'm so sorry.

40:12.744 --> 40:17.198
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

40:20.903 --> 40:23.070
It's okay, baby.

40:25.007 --> 40:27.208
It's okay.

40:44.977 --> 40:46.310
Come on,
Brats, let's go.

40:46.312 --> 40:48.396
We got the lead,
let's hold 'em!

40:49.883 --> 40:52.099
Whoa...

40:52.868 --> 40:54.692
Danno, what do you
want me to do?

40:54.693 --> 40:55.758
I want you to go have fun.

40:55.759 --> 40:56.942
Do whatever feels right, all right?
Okay.

40:56.944 --> 40:58.193
Keep your eye on
the ball and have fun.

40:58.195 --> 40:59.228
Listen to your dad,
all right?

40:59.230 --> 41:00.279
Okay.

41:00.281 --> 41:02.314
All right, come on.

41:07.353 --> 41:09.104
All right, Shrimps,
let's go!

41:09.106 --> 41:10.739
Come on, number seven, what do
you say? What do you say?

41:10.741 --> 41:11.990
What do you say?
Go, number seven.

41:11.992 --> 41:14.092
Have fun up there,
let's go.

41:14.094 --> 41:16.528
Have fun, Grace.

41:18.698 --> 41:19.948
Strike!

41:19.950 --> 41:20.916
Little outside, monkey.

41:20.918 --> 41:22.100
Good swing,
a little outside.

41:22.102 --> 41:23.635
Let's go, keep your eye on the ball.
Shrimp dogs!

41:23.637 --> 41:24.953
- It's all right, hang in there.
- Here we go, Grace!

41:25.956 --> 41:27.022
Come on!

41:27.024 --> 41:28.357
All right,
wait for the pitch now,

41:28.359 --> 41:30.509
wait for the pitch,
you got this.

41:30.511 --> 41:31.927
Take the job.

41:33.062 --> 41:34.129
Steve, I'm not...

41:34.131 --> 41:36.064
No, no, listen to me,
Catherine.

41:36.066 --> 41:37.516
Hey.

41:37.518 --> 41:38.967
We're good.

41:38.969 --> 41:40.986
Nothing's gonna
change that.

41:40.988 --> 41:42.404
Strike two!

41:42.406 --> 41:43.438
Good job, monkey.

41:43.440 --> 41:44.406
Good swing.

41:44.408 --> 41:46.191
Just have fun
up there, babe, okay?

41:46.193 --> 41:47.409
It's all right,
shake it off, have fun.

41:47.411 --> 41:49.027
Take the job.

41:57.654 --> 41:59.921
Time out! Time out!

42:08.798 --> 42:10.799
There's no kissing
in baseball, Steve.

42:13.553 --> 42:14.936
Sorry!
What do you mean, time out?

42:14.938 --> 42:17.439
Love.

42:17.441 --> 42:18.774
Let's play ball!

42:20.561 --> 42:21.877
All right, all right,
here we go, Grace.

42:21.879 --> 42:23.312
Come on, monkey,
be a batter up there,

42:23.314 --> 42:24.946
be a batter
up there.

42:24.948 --> 42:26.098
Wait for the pitch, now,

42:26.100 --> 42:28.150
wait for the pitch,
you got this.

42:28.152 --> 42:29.234
Roll with the pitch.

42:29.236 --> 42:31.236
All right.

42:31.238 --> 42:32.988
That's right,
that's right.

42:32.990 --> 42:34.823
Let's go,
go on, Gracie.

42:34.825 --> 42:36.208
Oh!

42:36.210 --> 42:38.460
Now, monkey, run! Go, go, go!

42:38.462 --> 42:39.911
Hey!

42:44.050 --> 42:45.000
Go, monkey, run!

42:45.002 --> 42:46.968
Go, go, go!
Gracie!

42:46.970 --> 42:48.887
Yeah!
