WEBVTT

00:09.426 --> 00:11.594
No, I don't want you
to talk this time.

00:11.678 --> 00:13.263
First, I just want
you to listen.

00:13.346 --> 00:15.265
- Why don't you--
- Because I don't want you

00:15.348 --> 00:17.434
to tell me
something, again,

00:17.517 --> 00:20.937
that closes off
another avenue of defense
for you, all right?

00:21.020 --> 00:23.440
<i>I know your side,</i>
<i>you hear mine.</i>

00:25.316 --> 00:28.278
Okay, I couldn't find
Cliff Jones.

00:28.361 --> 00:31.364
<i>I know, I know.</i>
<i>I know.</i>

00:31.448 --> 00:33.074
You sat with him
face-to-face.

00:33.158 --> 00:36.161
But the fact
that I couldn't
locate him anywhere

00:36.244 --> 00:38.163
means probably
Dick Andreesen
couldn't either.

00:38.246 --> 00:40.081
<i>And we're already</i>
<i>dealing with priors--</i>

00:40.165 --> 00:42.584
<i>the Toledo thing,</i>
<i>the New Orleans insurance</i>
<i>thing with FEMA.</i>

00:42.667 --> 00:43.960
I looked this up.

00:44.043 --> 00:45.712
None of that
pertains to the case.

00:45.795 --> 00:49.758
They are going to use it
to impeach your credibility.

00:49.841 --> 00:51.468
And not just because
this is Salt Lake City,

00:51.551 --> 00:55.180
<i>but because you are</i>
<i>a professional liar.</i>

00:55.263 --> 00:58.892
It will be the first thing
that Andreesen brings up,
I promise you.

00:58.975 --> 01:02.103
Unless--
unless he brings up
Eloise Brand.

01:02.187 --> 01:03.354
Which he can't.

01:03.438 --> 01:05.398
Which will appear
to be very similar.

01:05.482 --> 01:08.902
Which is not similar.
It is not similar at all,
you understand.

01:08.985 --> 01:10.945
There's nothing similar
about those two.

01:11.029 --> 01:12.781
I didn't love
Eloise Brand.

01:12.864 --> 01:14.783
<i>You understand</i>
<i>that I didn't love</i>
<i>Eloise Brand?</i>

01:14.866 --> 01:16.451
Besides which,
it's inadmissible.

01:16.534 --> 01:17.577
I know this.

01:17.660 --> 01:19.871
It's inad--
good, okay.

01:19.954 --> 01:24.793
So then we'll just rely
on the jurors to unhear it

01:24.876 --> 01:29.172
<i>if Dick slips</i>
<i>and it accidentally</i>
<i>comes out, right?</i>

01:29.255 --> 01:33.343
The point is, Eric,
there is what you would like
the playing field to be

01:33.426 --> 01:34.844
and there is what it is.

01:34.928 --> 01:37.138
<i>Which one do you want</i>
<i>to play on?</i>

01:38.515 --> 01:40.975
- Okay. So...?
-<i> Okay.</i>

01:42.977 --> 01:45.313
What is the reality here?

01:45.396 --> 01:46.689
The will.

01:46.773 --> 01:48.817
<i>Your argument</i>
<i>with Olivia,</i>

01:48.900 --> 01:51.820
overheard just minutes
before the murder

01:51.903 --> 01:54.489
by a guy who was going
to check on a sketch

01:54.572 --> 01:57.033
she was apparently
drawing for his kid.

01:57.116 --> 01:58.910
<i>Your fingerprints</i>
<i>are on the hammer.</i>

01:58.993 --> 02:00.787
I was remodeling.

02:00.870 --> 02:02.163
Eric.

02:04.415 --> 02:06.084
<i>The valets</i>
<i>in the lower parking lot</i>

02:06.167 --> 02:08.294
<i>describe your exit</i>
<i>as "rattled."</i>

02:08.378 --> 02:11.256
And when the police
found you in Truckee,
you fled.

02:11.339 --> 02:13.675
<i>You changed</i>
<i>your story twice.</i>

02:13.758 --> 02:17.762
And I know, I know--
Eric, I know you didn't
know she was dead,

02:17.846 --> 02:21.933
<i>but the fact is you lied,</i>
<i>for whatever reason.</i>

02:22.016 --> 02:25.353
And when you agreed
to take a polygraph--

02:25.436 --> 02:27.897
- Volunteered.
- That's right.
Yes, thank you.

02:27.981 --> 02:30.650
When you volunteered
against the advice

02:30.733 --> 02:32.026
of your
arresting officer--

02:32.110 --> 02:34.070
I was innocent.

02:34.153 --> 02:35.738
You failed your test.

02:35.822 --> 02:37.198
Because I was
feeling guilty,

02:37.282 --> 02:39.617
<i>but not about</i>
<i>what they thought.</i>

02:39.701 --> 02:40.952
<i>I was a mess,</i>

02:41.035 --> 02:44.163
which is why, I know,
I should have listened.

02:44.247 --> 02:48.459
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>So, I'm sorry.</i>

02:48.543 --> 02:49.752
<i>Please,</i>
<i>I'm sorry, okay?</i>

02:49.836 --> 02:55.675
So, what--
what are you suggesting?

02:55.758 --> 02:57.427
Please tell me
this isn't your full lunch.

02:57.510 --> 03:00.388
Yep. Hammersmith
had me until 2:00

03:00.471 --> 03:02.640
- bitching about
the new parking.
- Oh, God. I know, right?

03:02.724 --> 03:04.559
Honestly I don't think
anybody likes it better.

03:04.642 --> 03:08.438
Right? Then he wants us
to support him on
the team jerseys.

03:08.521 --> 03:10.857
I assume you're
coming here for a plea
'cause you don't have a case.

03:10.940 --> 03:13.067
Actually, I have a great case.
You don't have a body.

03:13.151 --> 03:15.403
( chuckles )
You think the jury's
gonna look at one photo

03:15.486 --> 03:17.196
from the crime scene
and think otherwise?

03:17.280 --> 03:18.615
Even you don't think
otherwise!

03:18.698 --> 03:22.577
- I believe my client.
- Ha!

03:22.660 --> 03:24.787
Did they fix this or not?
It's still cold.

03:24.871 --> 03:29.083
Yeah, that's the new one,
so I don't think you're having,
whatever, Cream of--

03:29.167 --> 03:31.628
- Leukemia?
- ( chuckles ) Gross.

03:31.711 --> 03:33.504
It's first-degree murder.
You know that.

03:33.588 --> 03:35.590
Without a body?
Good luck.

03:35.673 --> 03:37.467
What don't you like
about the new jerseys?

03:37.550 --> 03:40.678
- The whole "retro" thing?
It's tired.
- ( scoffs )

03:40.762 --> 03:44.891
- Look, I can agree to allocute
for no more than 24 years.
- That's never gonna happen.

03:44.974 --> 03:48.561
The will? The witnesses?
Even if I drop to second,
24 is a gift.

03:48.645 --> 03:51.481
You know that.
Great, now it's too hot.

03:51.564 --> 03:54.734
We're gonna get less
than that with a jury,
even in Salt Lake.

03:54.817 --> 03:59.155
Okay, I'll agree
to not oppose a request
for no more than 20.

03:59.238 --> 04:00.907
I'm going in
at manslaughter, 10.

04:00.990 --> 04:02.742
- ( chuckles )
With his priors? Really?
- Yeah.

04:02.825 --> 04:05.286
Will you do me a favor?
Will you taste this?
Smell it at least?

04:05.370 --> 04:06.788
It smells like soup
and chemicals.

04:06.871 --> 04:09.290
I don't know
what you want from me.

04:09.374 --> 04:13.169
We get a jury,
I'll roll we get first.
I'll risk a trial.

04:13.252 --> 04:15.505
I will accept second,
but we have to allocute
for 12.

04:15.588 --> 04:18.007
- 18, he's out in 12.
- ( scoffs )

04:18.091 --> 04:21.094
Seriously, that is
the most disgusting thing
I think I've ever tasted.

04:21.177 --> 04:23.554
That's because
you have to add
hot water to it, Dick.

04:23.638 --> 04:27.141
You can't just
put cold water in it
and then microwave it.

04:27.225 --> 04:30.228
- Right.
I put cold water in?
- Yes. 14.

04:30.311 --> 04:32.522
Aggravated, 16. That's it.
That's all I'm doing.

04:32.605 --> 04:36.150
- ( sighs )
- Oh. There they are,
by the way.

04:36.234 --> 04:38.319
Yeah, there is kind of
a "Damn Yankees" thing
going on there.

04:38.403 --> 04:39.654
- Right?
- All right, 16.

04:39.737 --> 04:41.322
But we're gonna have
to do this as an Alford.

04:41.406 --> 04:43.783
That's fine by me.
It's all guilty.

04:43.866 --> 04:46.536
<i>( chatter )</i>

04:46.619 --> 04:49.706
Nate:
<i>Hey. Hi, Alan.</i>

04:49.789 --> 04:52.542
Hey, so I still cannot
get Eric Neill

04:52.625 --> 04:54.419
to make any sort
of a statement

04:54.502 --> 04:56.004
other than
a flat-out denial.

04:56.087 --> 04:57.880
And I know you're gonna
think that I'm crazy,

04:57.964 --> 04:59.716
but I'm kind of
actually--

04:59.799 --> 05:00.925
I'm starting
to believe him.

05:01.009 --> 05:03.219
- You know, Nate--
- And he gave me a name.

05:03.302 --> 05:05.138
Actually, he gave me
a bunch of names,

05:05.221 --> 05:07.640
but the one that stands out
is this Cameron Morgan.

05:07.724 --> 05:09.559
He's this thuggish,
young guy.

05:09.642 --> 05:12.520
Apparently, Olivia loved
to surround herself
around young guys.

05:12.603 --> 05:16.357
Nate, Amy and Dick
have come to an agreement.

05:16.441 --> 05:19.360
Who's Amy and Dick?
Dick Andreesen?

05:19.444 --> 05:21.195
Wait, the prosecutor
Dick Andreesen?

05:21.279 --> 05:24.824
Yeah, and Amy Lambson,
that new public defender
up out of Provo.

05:24.907 --> 05:27.452
Nice gal.
Probably not that new
anymore, actually.

05:27.535 --> 05:29.537
Wait,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:29.620 --> 05:31.164
This isn't possible.

05:31.247 --> 05:33.207
I've still got
some more stuff to lay out.

05:33.291 --> 05:35.710
Listen to this--
this guy, Cameron,
he's got a list--

05:35.793 --> 05:38.212
Take yes
for an answer, Nate.

05:38.296 --> 05:39.964
We have the guy.

05:40.048 --> 05:41.507
- No.
- You arrested him.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.634
No, I need
a few more...

05:45.094 --> 05:48.014
Please, can we have
a few more days?

05:48.097 --> 05:50.391
- Please?
- It's over.

05:50.475 --> 05:52.185
You done good.

05:56.481 --> 05:58.900
Excuse me, Petra.

05:58.983 --> 06:00.068
Sorry.

06:00.151 --> 06:01.235
There's a guy
to see you

06:01.319 --> 06:03.613
from the TV show
"Heart of Homicide."

06:05.198 --> 06:07.200
- Oh, thank you.
- Sure.

06:09.827 --> 06:13.164
B. David:
<i>It must have been</i>
<i>very, very traumatic.</i>

06:13.247 --> 06:15.124
Petra:
<i>To put it mildly, yep.</i>

06:15.208 --> 06:19.253
The FBI storming
your kitchen.

06:19.337 --> 06:21.547
Christmas Eve,
right in the middle
of dinner.

06:22.840 --> 06:25.093
What was that like?

06:25.176 --> 06:28.638
Seeing your own father
dragged off like that?

06:28.721 --> 06:30.556
( scoffs )

06:30.640 --> 06:32.809
Right.

06:32.892 --> 06:35.812
Okay, so flash forward
10 years, here we are.

06:35.895 --> 06:38.523
Your brother's
been arrested.

06:38.606 --> 06:40.316
Does it bring up
any memories?

06:44.445 --> 06:47.740
You know,
we're gonna ask you
a lot about your brother.

06:51.994 --> 06:53.913
You're okay talking
about all this?

06:55.373 --> 06:56.999
Yeah, I think it...

06:58.376 --> 07:00.503
it's gonna
get out there anyway.

07:00.586 --> 07:02.088
Amy:
<i>That's what</i>
<i>you tell a reporter</i>

07:02.171 --> 07:03.714
when they ask you about
your brother's arrest?

07:03.798 --> 07:06.092
Well, I wasn't surprised.
I mean, it's a pattern.

07:06.175 --> 07:08.010
And I really don't see
how it matters now anyhow.

07:08.094 --> 07:11.139
It matters because
your brother's case
is flimsy at best.

07:11.222 --> 07:12.849
And pre-trying him
in the court of public opinion

07:12.932 --> 07:14.517
doesn't exactly
do him any favors.

07:14.600 --> 07:15.893
Well, there's
something else
I told him

07:15.977 --> 07:17.728
that I guess
you're really gonna like.

07:17.812 --> 07:19.105
Oh, God.

07:19.188 --> 07:22.191
I'm the one
who told the police
where he was.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.152
When the detective came
to Mom's hospice room,

07:24.235 --> 07:27.488
I told them he was
at our family's cabin
in Truckee.

07:29.866 --> 07:31.701
Great.

07:31.784 --> 07:34.245
Okay, actually,
maybe you should be
standing with the prosecutor.

07:34.328 --> 07:36.372
This is him in here.
His name is Dick Andreesen.

07:36.455 --> 07:37.999
And I'm happy
to introduce you
if you like.

07:38.082 --> 07:39.709
If not,
I'll just see you
in the courtroom.

07:39.792 --> 07:41.252
( sighs )

07:47.216 --> 07:49.552
Judge:
<i>On the docket</i>
<i>is case number</i>

07:49.635 --> 07:55.057
<i>2013-0009.</i>

07:55.141 --> 07:59.145
<i>State of Utah</i>
<i>versus Eric Neill.</i>

07:59.228 --> 08:02.773
<i>It's my understanding</i>
<i>the parties involved have</i>
<i>come to an agreement.</i>

08:02.857 --> 08:04.108
Dick:
<i>Yes, sir, Your Honor.</i>

08:04.192 --> 08:06.110
<i>We have indeed</i>
<i>reached an agreement.</i>

08:06.194 --> 08:08.196
<i>The defendant has agreed</i>
<i>to a change of plea</i>

08:08.279 --> 08:11.449
<i>to the reduced charge</i>
<i>of aggravated manslaughter.</i>

08:13.284 --> 08:16.787
<i>- ( piano music playing )</i>
<i>- ( dishes clattering )</i>

08:16.871 --> 08:18.915
<i>( chatter )</i>

08:18.998 --> 08:20.833
Tom:
<i>Christmas in February.</i>

08:20.917 --> 08:24.086
Excuse me.

08:24.170 --> 08:27.089
- Man:<i> Cheers.</i>
- Man #2:<i> Cheers,</i>
<i>man, cheers.</i>

08:27.173 --> 08:28.841
- Tom Davis.
- Alan Pape.

08:28.925 --> 08:31.594
I know,
the man himself.

08:31.677 --> 08:34.764
Uh, listen, I'll get
right to the point.

08:34.847 --> 08:37.516
It was really impressive work
with Eric Neill.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.227
- Really good stuff.
- Mmm.

08:39.310 --> 08:40.728
Now, I understand,

08:40.811 --> 08:42.855
if this doesn't fly for you,
I totally get it,

08:42.939 --> 08:48.194
but this crime,
this-- this Eric Neill
intrusion,

08:48.277 --> 08:51.822
it has spooked the heck
out of a lot of folks up here.

08:51.906 --> 08:54.992
The consensus is
we need new security.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.702
A new private firm,

08:56.786 --> 08:58.621
one we can count on,

08:58.704 --> 09:00.998
headed by a real pro.

09:01.082 --> 09:04.502
Oh, gosh, we already got
some pretty top-notch
outfits here.

09:04.585 --> 09:05.795
You're...

09:05.878 --> 09:08.548
a very gracious man,
as I've heard.

09:08.631 --> 09:11.342
But I have not heard
this bunch agree
on anything

09:11.425 --> 09:13.302
as simple as setbacks
from mailboxes

09:13.386 --> 09:15.471
like they agree
on this one big thing.

09:16.681 --> 09:18.224
The person
for the job...

09:19.517 --> 09:21.310
is Alan Pape.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.437
( chuckles )
Oh, well...

09:25.064 --> 09:27.400
Well, I, uh--

09:27.483 --> 09:30.319
honestly, I-- I've been
with the department--

09:30.403 --> 09:33.114
32 years.

09:33.197 --> 09:34.699
I hope you don't mind,

09:34.782 --> 09:37.201
a couple friends of mine
at county let me know
your salary.

09:37.285 --> 09:38.369
Oh.

09:38.452 --> 09:40.913
You decide
to accept this,

09:40.997 --> 09:43.541
we're prepared
to triple it.

09:43.624 --> 09:46.377
Bring in a couple guys--
your pick.

09:47.461 --> 09:48.879
It's all your call.

09:51.382 --> 09:53.592
Well, give it
some thought.

09:53.676 --> 09:55.511
I'll give you a call
in a couple of days,

09:55.594 --> 09:57.513
just check back in.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.516
Again, it's really...

10:01.892 --> 10:03.436
stellar work.

10:03.519 --> 10:05.062
It's really impressive.

10:06.147 --> 10:07.481
Thank you.

10:34.717 --> 10:37.428
-<i> ( equipment beeps )</i>
- Man:<i> Lookin' at ya.</i>

10:40.514 --> 10:41.849
Got it.

10:41.932 --> 10:44.310
- Okay, .147.
- 147.

10:44.393 --> 10:47.146
- ( beeping )
- Edge of water.

10:48.731 --> 10:50.274
Other side.

11:26.852 --> 11:28.854
Newscaster:
<i>Authorities say</i>
<i>what could be the hand</i>

11:28.938 --> 11:31.065
<i>of famed children's book</i>
<i>author Olivia Lake</i>

11:31.148 --> 11:34.193
<i>has been discovered</i>
<i>in a stream a half mile</i>
<i>from her property,</i>

11:34.276 --> 11:36.195
<i>adding both closure as well</i>
<i>as renewed attention</i>

11:36.278 --> 11:39.240
<i>to the events surrounding</i>
<i>her now four-year-old murder.</i>

11:39.323 --> 11:41.867
<i>Investigators are swarming</i>
<i>the abandoned mine shafts</i>

11:41.951 --> 11:43.661
<i>that dot the estate</i>
<i>surrounding Lake's...</i>

12:04.932 --> 12:09.061
Automated voice:
<i>This call is subject</i>
<i>to monitoring and recording.</i>

12:09.145 --> 12:11.605
( breathing heavily )

12:11.689 --> 12:16.819
So many, whatever,
pithy lines I wrote

12:16.902 --> 12:18.904
for this very moment.

12:20.698 --> 12:23.117
Was that one of them?

12:23.200 --> 12:25.953
No, but this is.

12:26.036 --> 12:28.622
Unless I'm wrong,
which I doubt,

12:28.706 --> 12:32.835
because I have
nothing else to do
but go over this ad infinitum,

12:32.918 --> 12:34.378
the last I heard,
it was you

12:34.462 --> 12:38.090
who turned me over
to the fucking police.

12:38.174 --> 12:40.968
Why are you here now?

12:47.475 --> 12:48.893
( sniffs )

12:51.270 --> 12:53.189
State law says
that conditional gifts

12:53.272 --> 12:56.442
when the condition's
precedent go unfulfilled become
the property of the giver,

12:56.525 --> 12:58.402
the condition in this case
being "Will you marry me,"

12:58.486 --> 13:02.072
the nonfulfillment being
"I can't, I'm dead."

13:03.240 --> 13:04.492
The fucking police
gave it to me.

13:04.575 --> 13:06.368
What would you like me
to do with it?

13:08.287 --> 13:11.165
So, you're here
'cause you wanna know

13:11.248 --> 13:14.919
what to do
with Aunt Beth's ring.

13:15.002 --> 13:16.462
What happened?

13:16.545 --> 13:21.175
Since Mom died, you don't
have any other projects?

13:21.258 --> 13:23.052
You know what?

13:23.135 --> 13:24.595
This will be
in Salt Lake
in storage.

13:24.678 --> 13:25.971
You can get it
in 2032.

13:26.055 --> 13:28.224
I'm not interested
in being the rudder

13:28.307 --> 13:33.270
that keeps you
from free-forming
around your life.

13:33.354 --> 13:34.647
Are you serious?

13:34.730 --> 13:37.316
Or one of your books
you get 600 pages
in writing

13:37.399 --> 13:39.235
and then abandon
completely.

13:39.318 --> 13:41.529
Okay, you know what?

13:41.612 --> 13:44.448
I was wrong to think
that you might not
deserve this.

13:44.532 --> 13:46.617
W-Wait!

13:46.700 --> 13:47.785
I'm sorry.

13:47.868 --> 13:49.411
I'm sorry!

13:55.000 --> 13:56.919
I'm sorry.

13:57.002 --> 13:59.046
Don't abandon me.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.845
- There you go.
- Great, thank you so much.

14:06.929 --> 14:07.805
You're welcome.

14:10.015 --> 14:12.059
Nate:
<i>Hey, Jim, take care</i>
<i>of this for me, okay?</i>

14:12.142 --> 14:13.894
<i>Yeah, I'm back.</i>
<i>So, when?</i>

14:13.978 --> 14:15.271
Monday?

14:15.354 --> 14:16.855
No, no, no,
what do you mean Monday?

14:16.939 --> 14:18.399
This is mining country, man.

14:18.482 --> 14:21.193
There are more geologists
than there are Starbucks.

14:21.277 --> 14:23.404
Then you call
someone else.

14:23.487 --> 14:26.323
No, hold on,
there has to be something
that can dig that deep

14:26.407 --> 14:28.367
in the amount of time
that we need it.

14:28.450 --> 14:32.204
Then-- then you make
new connections,
thank you!

14:32.288 --> 14:34.081
- Detective Henry.
Hi. Nate.
- What? Hi.

14:34.164 --> 14:36.458
- We met a few years ago.
I'm Petra.
- Petra.

14:36.542 --> 14:39.003
You're familiar with
the Government Records Access
and Management Act, I assume.

14:39.086 --> 14:41.297
I'm not,
but I am with you.

14:41.380 --> 14:43.257
What department did you say
you were with again, Petra?

14:43.340 --> 14:46.385
Actually, I'm not
with a department.
I'm Petra Neill.

14:46.468 --> 14:48.929
Oh, Jesus.
No, no, you can't
be here, then.

14:49.013 --> 14:51.307
- Please, just give me a moment.
- No, no, no, you can't be here.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.517
- A GRAMA request makes
cops' notes available--
- GRAMA?

14:53.601 --> 14:55.144
- G-R-A-M-A...
- GRAMA.

14:55.227 --> 14:57.187
...makes cops' notes
available to the defense,

14:57.271 --> 14:59.189
which makes them
part of the trial record.

14:59.273 --> 15:01.025
Okay, which means
you have my notes,

15:01.108 --> 15:02.610
and I need you
off the property now.

15:02.693 --> 15:04.278
I have copies,
which is why I have
a few questions for you.

15:04.361 --> 15:06.030
On the night of the murder,
you interviewed Joel Hurley.

15:06.113 --> 15:07.406
That's what
this is, right?

15:07.489 --> 15:09.450
Then you also interviewed
his friend, Frank Scott.

15:09.533 --> 15:11.076
Uh, yeah.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.954
What I noticed was when
referring to the night
Olivia was killed,

15:14.038 --> 15:15.998
Joel said,
"We took El Camino
to Arroyo Parkway

15:16.081 --> 15:18.208
to the Eastridge Mall
and saw the 10:20 'Hobbit 2.'"

15:18.292 --> 15:20.377
- Yeah, if you say so.
- Now listen to what Frank said.

15:20.461 --> 15:22.504
- ( reporters clamoring )
- No comment.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.006
"We went to
Eastridge Mall.

15:24.089 --> 15:26.550
We took El Camino to Arroyo,
and we saw the 10:20 showing

15:26.634 --> 15:28.218
of 'Hobbit 2:
The Desolation of Smaug.'"

15:28.302 --> 15:30.846
Go to two.
I don't understand
your point.

15:30.929 --> 15:32.848
They both almost said
exactly the same thing.

15:32.931 --> 15:35.267
They were going
to see the same movie.

15:35.351 --> 15:36.852
Okay.
Okay, sure, fine.

15:36.935 --> 15:38.354
But here's my question.

15:38.437 --> 15:40.856
Who says which road they took
and the exact time of the show

15:40.939 --> 15:42.691
when they're talking about
where they were one night?

15:42.775 --> 15:45.653
Two people who are talking
to a police detective

15:45.736 --> 15:47.863
the day after a murder
was discovered.

15:47.946 --> 15:50.240
Hey, if you're suggesting
that two guys that I've known,

15:50.324 --> 15:53.702
one I knew for two years,
one I've known for
well over 30,

15:53.786 --> 15:55.371
are lying
for some reason--

15:55.454 --> 15:57.456
No, what I'm saying
is that every other person
in your notes

15:57.539 --> 15:59.375
spoke a certain way,
and these two didn't.

15:59.458 --> 16:01.460
And honestly,
I'm surprised
you didn't notice.

16:04.505 --> 16:06.465
You ever heard
of zebra-itis?

16:06.548 --> 16:10.260
- No.
- Okay, here's what
zebra-itis is,

16:10.344 --> 16:12.054
and then I'm gonna
need you to step back

16:12.137 --> 16:14.848
and stop contaminating
my crime scene.

16:14.932 --> 16:18.686
If it smells like a horse
and it leaves a trail
of horse prints

16:18.769 --> 16:20.938
and a big pile
of horse manure,

16:21.021 --> 16:23.107
it's a horse.

16:23.190 --> 16:26.694
But amateurs and rookies,
they think they're so smart.

16:26.777 --> 16:29.988
Web sleuths spend all day
poking through rainbows,

16:30.072 --> 16:31.949
looking for zebras.

16:32.032 --> 16:33.701
- Unicorns.
- I'm sorry?

16:33.784 --> 16:35.369
Which still would work
as a metaphor,

16:35.452 --> 16:38.288
but rainbows is unicorns,
even though I totally
get your point.

16:39.456 --> 16:41.208
I need you
to move now.

16:41.291 --> 16:43.085
- You didn't think
it was a horse.
- Yo, Adam!

16:43.168 --> 16:44.795
- Please.
- "All signs point to Eric,

16:44.878 --> 16:47.464
but in my gut, hmm,
it just doesn't feel
like Eric to me."

16:47.548 --> 16:49.383
Emphasis mine,
but you said it
to yourself

16:49.466 --> 16:51.802
in your own case notes
right here, page 31.

16:51.885 --> 16:54.012
You didn't think
it was Eric at the time.

16:54.096 --> 16:56.098
<i>( helicopter whirring )</i>

16:59.226 --> 17:01.645
I got this, Adam.
Thanks, anyway.

17:03.939 --> 17:07.484
Look, I'm just one guy.
I'm not the system, so...

17:07.568 --> 17:09.528
But you got angry
at the system.

17:09.611 --> 17:12.281
Your letter to the prosecutor,
Dick Andreesen, asking for
more time,

17:12.364 --> 17:13.907
it's in the discovery.

17:13.991 --> 17:17.161
Even though he had already
closed down the investigation.

17:17.244 --> 17:19.747
You were looking for
the elusive zebra, perhaps?

17:20.956 --> 17:22.750
Unicorn maybe,
even?

17:22.833 --> 17:25.377
My issues with
what went down
four years ago

17:25.461 --> 17:27.421
have nothing to do with
what's happening here now.

17:27.504 --> 17:29.631
Olivia's friend JC
said Joel owed her
10 months' back rent

17:29.715 --> 17:30.966
by the night
of the murder.

17:31.049 --> 17:32.217
And Horacio,
the gardener,

17:32.301 --> 17:33.469
said that Joel
sold him his truck

17:33.552 --> 17:35.137
for a quarter
of what it was worth

17:35.220 --> 17:38.891
and then split town
three days after
the murder.

17:38.974 --> 17:40.934
What are you
trying to say?

17:41.018 --> 17:43.145
I want to talk
to Frank Scott.

17:43.228 --> 17:45.022
Petra:
<i>You don't think it's weird</i>
<i>that you found the hand</i>

17:45.105 --> 17:46.815
<i>on Michael O'Connor's</i>
<i>property?</i>

17:46.899 --> 17:49.818
<i>And on the day</i>
<i>Olivia was murdered,</i>

17:49.902 --> 17:53.238
<i>she called Michael O'Connor</i>
<i>and talked to him for,</i>
<i>like, a minute...</i>

17:53.322 --> 17:55.699
- 52 seconds.
-<i> ...just before she died.</i>

17:55.783 --> 17:58.869
Yeah, I did
find that weird
at the time.

18:00.078 --> 18:01.163
<i>And?</i>

18:04.625 --> 18:06.877
Believe it or not,
you know,

18:06.960 --> 18:09.046
I followed up on that.

18:09.129 --> 18:11.590
There were witnesses
to the call.

18:11.673 --> 18:13.008
<i>Olivia was upset.</i>

18:13.091 --> 18:15.052
<i>She had had a fight</i>
<i>with your brother.</i>

18:15.135 --> 18:16.929
<i>Michael tried</i>
<i>to console her.</i>

18:17.012 --> 18:19.139
<i>He couldn't.</i>

18:19.223 --> 18:21.600
Okay, don't you think
it's weird that she--

18:21.683 --> 18:24.728
that Michael
and his associate,
Tom Davis,

18:24.812 --> 18:26.897
flew to Turks and Caicos
the very next day?

18:26.980 --> 18:30.150
<i>As they did</i>
<i>every New Year's.</i>

18:30.234 --> 18:33.987
<i>Same destination,</i>
<i>same flight.</i>

18:34.071 --> 18:35.781
<i>You know what</i>
<i>would've been weird?</i>

18:35.864 --> 18:37.407
<i>If they didn't leave.</i>

18:37.491 --> 18:39.201
Have you
re-interviewed him?

18:39.284 --> 18:42.120
-<i> No.</i>
- Because?

18:42.204 --> 18:44.164
Because...
( clears throat )

18:44.248 --> 18:47.167
because of what you've
already read in my notes.

18:47.251 --> 18:48.710
He never left the house.

18:48.794 --> 18:50.921
His cell phone
never left the house.

18:51.004 --> 18:54.216
- There were--
- Witnesses, I get it.

18:54.299 --> 18:58.095
- Wait, was the hand...?
- What, cut off in the murder?

18:58.178 --> 19:00.430
Not unless she was killed
by a dozen tiny rodents

19:00.514 --> 19:03.809
over a period
of 8 to 10 months, no.

19:03.892 --> 19:06.603
<i>And, yes, we are checking</i>
<i>all the old mine shafts</i>

19:06.687 --> 19:08.522
<i>that feed</i>
<i>into that stream.</i>

19:12.651 --> 19:14.278
I got a question
for you.

19:15.946 --> 19:18.323
<i>You care so much</i>
<i>about your brother Eric...</i>

19:20.784 --> 19:23.203
<i>Where were you</i>
<i>when he needed you most?</i>

19:25.289 --> 19:26.415
<i>Hmm?</i>

19:28.458 --> 19:30.335
<i>And why now,</i>
<i>four years later,</i>

19:30.419 --> 19:33.297
<i>are you suddenly</i>
<i>all over this?</i>

19:36.133 --> 19:40.012
I think I might have
been wrong about Eric

19:40.095 --> 19:43.724
in this
specific situation.

19:43.807 --> 19:46.643
Ah, oh.
( chuckles )

19:46.727 --> 19:48.478
Okay.

19:48.562 --> 19:50.022
Hmm.

19:50.105 --> 19:51.440
Okay.

19:52.524 --> 19:54.026
<i>So, this is about you.</i>

19:59.781 --> 20:01.158
I mean, yeah.

20:02.784 --> 20:05.495
What?
We went to the movies.

20:05.579 --> 20:07.414
"Hobbit."

20:07.497 --> 20:09.499
"Hobbit 2."
10:20 show.

20:09.583 --> 20:12.044
You took El Camino
to Arroyo Parkway to
the Eastridge Mall.

20:12.127 --> 20:15.297
It's all
in the case notes.

20:15.380 --> 20:18.342
- Do you wanna
stick with that?
- Would you let me...?

20:18.425 --> 20:20.469
I'll ask
the questions.

20:20.552 --> 20:22.429
Hey, so,
all we need to know

20:22.512 --> 20:24.514
is if you and Joel,

20:24.598 --> 20:27.601
for whatever reason,

20:27.684 --> 20:29.561
made up that story.

20:29.645 --> 20:34.107
<i>I can find out now</i>
<i>or we can talk later.</i>

20:34.191 --> 20:36.026
<i>I can find out then.</i>

20:38.904 --> 20:40.030
Okay.

20:42.616 --> 20:44.451
<i>Okay.</i>

20:44.534 --> 20:47.955
- If you're really asking me.
- Nate:<i> Yeah.</i>

20:49.539 --> 20:52.668
I've got this
to say about Joel.

20:52.751 --> 20:56.338
There's the Joel
that everyone sees...

20:59.424 --> 21:02.260
and then there's
the other Joel.

21:07.349 --> 21:10.185
Melissa:
<i>I don't understand</i>
<i>why that's emasculating.</i>

21:10.269 --> 21:12.854
Nate:
<i>Oh, co-- at the crime scene?</i>

21:12.938 --> 21:14.272
<i>In front of everybody?</i>

21:14.356 --> 21:17.567
<i>And making me have</i>
<i>no choice about it?</i>

21:17.651 --> 21:19.611
<i>Uh, where's Morgan?</i>

21:19.695 --> 21:22.489
At Owen's.
I'll text Marney.

21:22.572 --> 21:24.574
<i>And you know Frank.</i>
<i>I mean...</i>

21:24.658 --> 21:28.537
<i>like I'm going</i>
<i>to empower her</i>
<i>to talk to him?</i>

21:28.620 --> 21:30.205
<i>To Frank?</i>

21:30.288 --> 21:33.625
You're not empowering her.
She already has the power.

21:33.709 --> 21:35.293
She's a private citizen.

21:35.377 --> 21:36.920
She can talk
to whoever she wants.

21:37.004 --> 21:39.381
You're just afraid that--
'cause Frank is--

21:39.464 --> 21:42.134
-<i> The loosest cannon ever.</i>
- That you're gonna
lose control.

21:43.969 --> 21:47.639
I don't even know
what it's control of.

21:47.723 --> 21:49.725
But this hand comes up,

21:49.808 --> 21:52.185
and then this girl
shows up,

21:52.269 --> 21:57.524
and suddenly I have no choice
but to follow somebody else's
agenda and it's not mine.

21:57.607 --> 21:59.359
It sounds like
she was right.

21:59.443 --> 22:02.487
- Which is beside the point.
- Which is exactly the point.

22:02.571 --> 22:04.239
- No, it's not.
- Yes.

22:04.322 --> 22:08.076
You had the case
completely yanked away
from you four years ago.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.870
You never liked
the result,

22:09.953 --> 22:14.750
and if it was some dude
who just suddenly showed up
out of the blue,

22:14.833 --> 22:17.586
you would be saying to me,
"Mel, oh, my God,

22:17.669 --> 22:19.671
the luckiest thing
happened."

22:21.339 --> 22:23.800
I don't see
where this is going.

22:23.884 --> 22:27.929
You were emasculated
because it was a woman,

22:28.013 --> 22:29.598
is what I'm saying.

22:32.684 --> 22:36.021
Okay.
I believe you're correct.

22:36.104 --> 22:37.898
Yeah, I know.

22:37.981 --> 22:41.109
You'll be fine.
You can handle her.

22:41.193 --> 22:45.030
You know who I would
be worried about is Alan.

22:47.157 --> 22:51.036
Assuming she can
get Joel back, when do
you think that would be?

22:51.119 --> 22:53.371
Oh!
And that's another thing.

22:53.455 --> 22:58.126
She's so supremely confident
that she can get Joel
to come back.

22:58.210 --> 23:00.003
I mean, Joel?

23:00.087 --> 23:02.589
Joel freaking
hated it here
by the end.

23:02.672 --> 23:04.466
I mean, come on,
you saw his Facebook posts.

23:04.549 --> 23:06.510
- ( keypad beeping )
- ( clicks )

23:06.593 --> 23:09.805
He's a totally different guy
down there.

23:09.888 --> 23:13.809
I say there's no way

23:13.892 --> 23:15.685
she'll get him
to come back.

23:18.897 --> 23:19.856
What?

23:21.691 --> 23:24.528
I think
you're underestimating
this person.

23:24.611 --> 23:26.947
<i>( boat motor whirring )</i>

23:27.030 --> 23:30.575
- Joel:<i> We'll go</i>
<i>right up these lilies here.</i>
- Man:<i> All right! Whoo-hoo!</i>

23:30.659 --> 23:32.077
<i>Here we go!</i>

23:32.160 --> 23:35.080
<i>( whooping )</i>
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

23:35.163 --> 23:36.498
Whoo!

23:36.581 --> 23:38.667
- Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo!

23:43.421 --> 23:45.882
Boy:
<i>What can kill an alligator?</i>

23:45.966 --> 23:49.094
Let's see.
What can hurt
one of these things?

23:49.177 --> 23:50.846
What can harm
an alligator?

23:52.347 --> 23:53.473
Nothing.

23:55.433 --> 23:59.479
Well, scratch that. We can.
We're its only predators.

23:59.563 --> 24:01.565
Unless you keep leaning
over the edge like that,
Junior.

24:01.648 --> 24:02.649
Then things
are gonna change.

24:05.694 --> 24:09.030
Joel:
<i>Uh, uh, Junior...</i>

24:09.114 --> 24:10.991
- You see that out there?
- Man: Where?

24:11.074 --> 24:13.160
- Straight?
- Joel: That's our
little trophy.

24:13.243 --> 24:14.619
Man:
Straight ahead,
right there!

24:14.703 --> 24:16.663
- Right there.
- Let's not spook this one.

24:16.746 --> 24:19.332
- See him right there
just beyond that tree?
- Yeah.

24:19.416 --> 24:22.502
All right, the next job
is get that sucker
on the boat.

24:22.586 --> 24:24.254
Who's gonna
do the deed? Ava?

24:24.337 --> 24:26.464
- Thanks, but, no, thanks.
- ( chuckles )

24:26.548 --> 24:29.676
Okay, definitely not Ava.
How about you, Dad?

24:32.137 --> 24:33.930
- Taylor?
- Oh, Junior?

24:34.014 --> 24:35.682
You gonna do it?

24:35.765 --> 24:37.726
- Huh?
- I think so.

24:37.809 --> 24:39.060
All right.

24:39.144 --> 24:40.395
I thought
you might be unsure,

24:40.478 --> 24:43.857
but you're gonna
give her a go, huh?

24:43.940 --> 24:46.526
Put it on
your shoulder, son.

24:46.610 --> 24:48.862
You ever handle
one of these before?

24:48.945 --> 24:51.740
- Not too many times.
- ( chuckles )

24:51.823 --> 24:53.533
I know it's hard
with that life preserver,

24:53.617 --> 24:57.370
but you just put her
right up there on
your arm there.

24:57.454 --> 25:00.874
Make sure it's on safety
until you get that
sucker ready.

25:00.957 --> 25:03.043
You're gonna wanna hit it
just between the eyes here.

25:03.126 --> 25:07.422
- That's the sweet--
that's the sweet spot.
- Nice, deep breath.

25:07.505 --> 25:08.840
Joel:
<i>Nice, deep breath.</i>

25:08.924 --> 25:11.092
<i>You don't wanna ruin</i>
<i>that trophy.</i>

25:11.176 --> 25:12.469
- ( gunshot )
- Joel: Yeah!

25:12.552 --> 25:14.971
- ( Dad chuckling )
- Joel: There you go, Junior!

25:19.351 --> 25:21.186
Skin's all rolled up.

25:21.269 --> 25:24.064
Tell Ty I sent you.
He'll cut you a deal
on that taxidermy.

25:24.147 --> 25:26.900
- Sounds good.
- I got your meat
on the ice here.

25:26.983 --> 25:28.985
Keep these "not for sale"
stickers visible

25:29.069 --> 25:30.737
in case
the DWF stops you.

25:30.820 --> 25:32.572
- ( chuckles )
- You are good to go.

25:32.656 --> 25:34.157
- Thanks, Joel.
- My pleasure.

25:34.241 --> 25:36.368
Buckshot,
hold onto that.

25:36.451 --> 25:37.535
Bye.

25:37.619 --> 25:38.828
Hope you had
a great time.

25:38.912 --> 25:41.122
If you did, we're
Big Bayou Gator Guides.

25:41.206 --> 25:45.085
If not, we're
Outdoor Adventures,
as the joke goes.

25:45.168 --> 25:48.129
- ( chuckles )
Thanks, Pat.
- ( engine starts )

25:48.213 --> 25:50.924
Hope they got
the sizes right
this time.

26:01.309 --> 26:02.686
Bobby.

26:04.479 --> 26:06.189
Oh, hi.

26:06.273 --> 26:09.359
I didn't see you there.
Can I help you with
something?

26:09.442 --> 26:11.653
- Are you Joel Hurley?
- I am.

26:11.736 --> 26:13.488
Oh, thank God.

26:15.532 --> 26:18.118
Can we go somewhere
and talk?

26:18.201 --> 26:22.163
-<i> ( music playing over stereo )</i>
<i>- ( Joel sighs ) Ugh!</i>

26:23.957 --> 26:26.793
<i>Bobby! Sorry.</i>

26:26.876 --> 26:28.545
<i>They got</i>
<i>the kids large again.</i>

26:28.628 --> 26:30.005
<i>You gotta call them</i>
<i>about next week.</i>

26:30.088 --> 26:32.007
<i>I still haven't gotten</i>
<i>their thing.</i>

26:32.090 --> 26:35.343
- Bobby: I'll give them
a shout and get it straight.
- Sorry.

26:35.427 --> 26:36.845
Is this your art?

26:36.928 --> 26:38.221
It is.

26:42.934 --> 26:44.060
( clears throat )

26:49.065 --> 26:51.443
Do you
recognize me?

26:51.526 --> 26:53.028
Should I?

26:53.111 --> 26:55.613
I'm Petra Neill.
I'm Eric Neill's sister.

26:57.365 --> 27:00.785
- Petra: Please,
just hear me out.
- Look, I hardly knew him.

27:00.869 --> 27:03.496
- And from what I did know--
- I know he could be
complicated.

27:03.580 --> 27:06.833
No, he could be an asshole
is what he could be,
to be honest.

27:06.916 --> 27:10.545
Well, he said that
you were a good guy.

27:10.628 --> 27:14.215
He said you might be
the only one who could
help me.

27:14.299 --> 27:15.925
He said you'd
at least listen.

27:16.009 --> 27:17.260
Please.

27:18.720 --> 27:19.679
( sighs )

27:21.306 --> 27:22.974
Do you mind
if we change the music?

27:23.058 --> 27:26.478
- Sure. To what?
- Silence.

27:26.561 --> 27:31.816
- Okay, the music
is now silence.
-<i> ( music turns off )</i>

27:31.900 --> 27:33.818
What's up?

27:33.902 --> 27:37.864
Do you remember one night,
maybe a week or two
before the murder,

27:37.947 --> 27:41.076
when you saw
someone on the property
and you chased him off?

27:41.159 --> 27:42.494
Why?

27:42.577 --> 27:45.413
You told Eric about it
that night.

27:45.497 --> 27:47.207
You said his name
was Cameron.

27:47.290 --> 27:49.584
I think, uh...
( sighs )

27:52.379 --> 27:55.757
someone told me then
that it would've been Cameron,

27:55.840 --> 27:57.675
so, sure, Cameron.

27:57.759 --> 27:59.427
I need to find him.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.304
Well, I saw him
for about 10 seconds.

28:01.388 --> 28:03.264
It was in the dark.
It was the woods.

28:03.348 --> 28:06.309
He got in the car and drove off,
so I'd have no idea on
how to locate him.

28:06.393 --> 28:09.437
So he could--
he said those will work
until we get the 400s.

28:09.521 --> 28:12.816
There was someone in that car
that Cameron got into.

28:12.899 --> 28:16.736
And you told Eric back then
that you might know him.

28:16.820 --> 28:20.240
I think I said
that he might have looked
vaguely familiar, yeah.

28:20.323 --> 28:22.409
You said he was
a bartender.

28:22.492 --> 28:24.536
Look, I don't know.
It was four years ago.

28:24.619 --> 28:26.329
Do you remember
which bar?

28:26.413 --> 28:30.125
Oh, God, I--
I really don't know.

28:30.208 --> 28:33.545
Please don't tell me this
is what you flew all the way
down here to find out.

28:43.304 --> 28:44.764
Keep going.
I'm listening.

28:46.599 --> 28:48.435
I believe my brother
is innocent.

28:48.518 --> 28:51.104
Of the crime that
he confessed to committing?

28:51.187 --> 28:53.648
He pled out
without admitting guilt.

28:53.731 --> 28:55.275
He had
no other choice.

28:56.943 --> 29:00.905
The media, his lawyer,
everyone rushed to judgment.

29:00.989 --> 29:03.199
But they never
found a body.

29:03.283 --> 29:06.453
And I believe
that if I can prove
there were other suspects,

29:06.536 --> 29:08.788
people that
the attorney overlooked,

29:08.872 --> 29:11.124
then I believe I can
get him an appeal.

29:11.207 --> 29:13.001
Now, after
all this time?

29:13.084 --> 29:14.961
There's new
information.

29:15.044 --> 29:18.131
In prison,
someone told Eric
that that guy Cameron

29:18.214 --> 29:20.925
was talking about a safe
in Olivia's studio

29:21.009 --> 29:23.094
and how she kept cash
and drawings in there.

29:23.178 --> 29:26.264
And Eric has been writing
to his lawyer, but...

29:26.347 --> 29:27.557
don't get me
started on her.

29:27.640 --> 29:31.811
So, please...

29:31.895 --> 29:35.732
do you think maybe
you can remember which bar?

29:35.815 --> 29:38.818
If I can find out
who that bartender is,

29:38.902 --> 29:40.320
I think maybe
I can find Cameron.

29:40.403 --> 29:43.490
You know the town.
There are a lot of bars.

29:43.573 --> 29:46.326
Could you point it out
if you were standing there?

29:46.409 --> 29:49.996
( chuckles )
I don't know.
Possibly.

29:50.079 --> 29:51.998
Would you know him
if you saw him?

29:52.081 --> 29:53.666
What are you asking me?

29:55.376 --> 29:57.086
No, I can't
go back there.

29:57.170 --> 29:59.255
Just for a day or two.
That's all I need.

29:59.339 --> 30:02.717
Please.
You know the area.
You lived on the property.

30:02.800 --> 30:04.385
You know the town,
you know the people.

30:04.469 --> 30:05.553
Knew.

30:07.263 --> 30:09.224
Please, just think
about it?

30:10.808 --> 30:12.060
Here's my number.

30:15.605 --> 30:18.441
I have no one else
I can turn to.

30:18.525 --> 30:21.402
You're literally the only
person on the planet
who could help me.

30:23.363 --> 30:24.489
Please.

30:25.698 --> 30:27.617
I'm sorry.
I can't.

30:27.700 --> 30:29.827
<i>( car approaching )</i>

30:32.372 --> 30:34.249
<i>( engine turns off )</i>

30:41.965 --> 30:43.841
- Hey, babe.
- How was work, honey?

30:43.925 --> 30:44.884
Fine.

30:48.471 --> 30:50.598
Laura:
What's going on?

30:50.682 --> 30:55.436
<i>So, this is all just</i>
<i>about finding Cameron,</i>
<i>really?</i>

30:59.482 --> 31:01.150
Yeah.

31:01.234 --> 31:03.736
You-- I mean,
the weird thing

31:03.820 --> 31:07.991
is that I was gonna tell
the police back then
about Cameron,

31:08.074 --> 31:10.118
<i>but, you know,</i>
<i>I just got caught up</i>

31:10.201 --> 31:12.704
<i>in the whole</i>
<i>"Eric, Eric" thing</i>
<i>with everybody else, and...</i>

31:13.997 --> 31:15.373
I mean,
even when we got here,

31:15.456 --> 31:17.375
it just-- it still
kept eating at me,

31:17.458 --> 31:21.212
that look on
Cameron's face that night.

31:21.296 --> 31:24.382
It was-- like,
you know how crocodiles,

31:24.465 --> 31:26.509
they have that
lower row of teeth

31:26.593 --> 31:29.554
like they're smiling at you,
like they know something
about you?

31:30.847 --> 31:32.181
That was Cameron.

31:34.392 --> 31:36.936
<i>Then Eric confesses</i>
<i>and four years go by</i>

31:37.020 --> 31:40.481
<i>and Olivia's hand</i>
<i>shows up</i>

31:40.565 --> 31:43.651
<i>and his sister</i>
<i>flies down to Louisiana,</i>

31:43.735 --> 31:46.362
and now, fuck.

31:46.446 --> 31:49.449
So, what's the problem?

31:56.039 --> 31:59.417
There's a reason we left there,
and it wasn't just Olivia.

31:59.500 --> 32:03.755
( sighs ) To be honest,
I don't think I can
go back there again.

32:05.632 --> 32:07.258
<i>Why are you</i>
<i>looking at me</i>
<i>like that?</i>

32:07.342 --> 32:09.177
Well,
of course you can.

32:10.845 --> 32:13.973
<i>( chuckles )</i>
<i>I swore to myself</i>
<i>I never would.</i>

32:16.100 --> 32:19.479
Yeah, but you're
different now.

32:19.562 --> 32:21.022
Everything's
different now.

32:22.607 --> 32:24.442
I know you don't
believe in the universe--

32:24.525 --> 32:26.778
Well, I believe it exists.
( chuckles )

32:26.861 --> 32:29.947
But you don't believe
it gives you opportunities.

32:30.031 --> 32:32.659
Oh, it really hasn't.

32:32.742 --> 32:36.162
Well, what if
the one thing between...

32:36.245 --> 32:39.415
- How long is it total?
-<i> 15 to 20.</i>

32:39.499 --> 32:43.336
Yeah, well,
what if the difference
between 16 more years of jail

32:43.419 --> 32:45.838
and his sudden freedom
is you?

32:49.634 --> 32:51.844
How come you get
to be so perfect?

32:51.928 --> 32:55.223
- Because I don't.
-<i> Because you do.</i>

32:57.433 --> 32:58.935
<i>And you are.</i>

33:03.022 --> 33:05.525
I still can't believe
we made it here.

33:10.279 --> 33:11.447
Come here.

33:22.625 --> 33:24.085
Joel:
I love you.

33:24.168 --> 33:25.920
Laura:
I love you, too.

34:30.693 --> 34:32.987
Joel:
<i>It's kind of okay,</i>
<i>actually.</i>

34:33.070 --> 34:37.909
<i>In my mind,</i>
<i>Summit had morphed</i>
<i>into this Arkham,</i>

34:37.992 --> 34:40.995
Hellboy, Lovecrafty, Salem,
Hall of Ghosts thing,

34:41.078 --> 34:43.289
and then I get here
and it's like,

34:43.372 --> 34:46.793
"Oh, right, it's just
craft stores and galleries

34:46.876 --> 34:49.086
and-- here's a word
I don't use that often--

34:49.170 --> 34:50.797
it's quaint."

34:52.089 --> 34:53.591
And she is
in a pipe dream.

34:53.674 --> 34:57.011
I don't wanna say
I feel sorry for her, but...

34:57.094 --> 35:00.097
Uh, all right.
Speak to you soon, love.

35:00.181 --> 35:02.892
We're off to go
track down a ghost.

35:02.975 --> 35:05.853
Yeah.
Love you, too.
Bye.

35:05.937 --> 35:07.063
- Sorry.
- Got you one anyway.

35:07.146 --> 35:08.356
- Thanks.
- It's okay.

35:08.439 --> 35:10.316
Oh, here.
Also if you need it.

35:10.399 --> 35:12.235
I need to step away
for a few minutes.

35:12.318 --> 35:14.654
I have some things
I need to take care of.

35:14.737 --> 35:17.323
Uh, wait, seriously?

35:17.406 --> 35:18.991
Yeah, I-- I, uh...

35:19.075 --> 35:21.160
I gotta follow up
on some stuff that
I started the other day.

35:21.244 --> 35:23.621
But if you find anything,
just text me.

35:23.704 --> 35:25.873
- All right.
- Otherwise, an hour,
hour and a half?

35:25.957 --> 35:27.834
Yeah, all right.

35:27.917 --> 35:29.335
I'll, uh--

35:29.418 --> 35:33.256
I'll just go track down
the dude that knew Cameron.

35:33.339 --> 35:34.841
Great.

35:34.924 --> 35:36.384
Yeah,
should be easy.

35:36.467 --> 35:38.261
- ( laughs )
All right.
- Okay.

35:38.344 --> 35:40.096
- Hour.
- Oh, and, Joel?

35:40.179 --> 35:43.432
- Yeah?
- Seriously, thank you.

35:45.059 --> 35:47.270
Yeah, of course.

35:47.353 --> 35:49.480
- All right,
I'll see you soon.
- Okay.

36:03.494 --> 36:04.745
( no audible dialogue )

36:23.681 --> 36:27.018
( no audible dialogue )

37:07.183 --> 37:09.352
Man:
<i>Yeah, shit,</i>
<i>I remember that clown.</i>

37:09.435 --> 37:12.980
If you do find him,
tell him he still owes me
for two months.

37:13.064 --> 37:16.067
Better yet,
bring him here.
I'll tell him myself.

37:16.150 --> 37:18.527
Well, he was here
with a girl, though, right?

37:18.611 --> 37:21.322
Yeah, poor little<i> señorita.</i>
She didn't know what hit her.

37:21.405 --> 37:23.449
Then that guy,
pfft, bolts

37:23.532 --> 37:25.701
day before Christmas.

37:25.785 --> 37:28.162
( sighs )

37:28.245 --> 37:29.789
Any idea
where she is?

37:29.872 --> 37:33.834
Mmm, I wanna say
she was gone about
a week later.

37:33.918 --> 37:35.795
She's Mexican.

37:35.878 --> 37:37.672
Could be anywhere.

37:37.755 --> 37:39.882
Joel:
<i>She got a name?</i>

37:39.966 --> 37:42.134
Man:
<i>Yeah, Leticia.</i>

37:42.218 --> 37:44.178
<i>I can't remember</i>
<i>the last name,</i>

37:44.261 --> 37:45.763
<i>but I remember Leticia.</i>

37:46.889 --> 37:48.599
<i>Pretty name.</i>

37:58.901 --> 38:00.319
<i>( phone chimes )</i>

38:14.041 --> 38:15.459
Don't blame our town.

38:15.543 --> 38:18.754
I'm told you need
suffering to make art.

38:18.838 --> 38:22.341
Yeah, but it's the artist
who's supposed to suffer.

38:22.425 --> 38:24.927
- Ah.
- You owe me a dollar.

38:25.011 --> 38:27.722
Yes, I do.

38:27.805 --> 38:29.724
Did he put up
a fight?

38:29.807 --> 38:34.061
Mmm, a bit, but not.

38:34.145 --> 38:37.732
Hey, how did he seem?

38:37.815 --> 38:40.693
How are things
with him and Laura?

38:40.776 --> 38:42.611
Seemed like he had
a good thing going
down there,

38:42.695 --> 38:44.530
if that's
what you mean.

38:44.613 --> 38:47.199
Sweet girl, Laura.

38:47.283 --> 38:49.201
We used to joke that
she'd need a neck brace

38:49.285 --> 38:51.162
the way that she would
look up to him.

38:51.245 --> 38:53.122
<i>( music playing )</i>

39:03.340 --> 39:04.675
<i>( phone chimes )</i>

39:08.763 --> 39:11.557
- Hi.
- Hey.

39:11.640 --> 39:13.768
Two beers, please.
Whatever's your local best.

39:13.851 --> 39:15.936
She'll have
a Polygamist Porter

39:16.020 --> 39:18.064
and I'll have
a Diet Coke, please.

39:18.147 --> 39:20.649
- You guys have Advil?
- No. Sorry.

39:24.445 --> 39:26.614
- Thanks.
- Oh, sure.

39:26.697 --> 39:29.241
And thank you
for your message about
Cameron's old apartment.

39:29.325 --> 39:31.077
There's a guy
checking on the bills

39:31.160 --> 39:34.705
and hoping to get something
about the old girlfriend...

39:34.789 --> 39:36.290
- Great.
- ...and maybe
a forwarding address.

39:36.373 --> 39:39.168
- So, well done.
- Great.

39:39.251 --> 39:41.462
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

39:41.545 --> 39:44.048
And congratulations
to me, too, I guess.

39:44.131 --> 39:46.717
- For?
- Being smart enough
to bring you here.

39:46.801 --> 39:50.304
You did more in 60 minutes
than I did in three days,
so thank you.

39:50.387 --> 39:52.973
Aw, thanks.
Just trying to help.

39:55.893 --> 39:57.645
- So, I, uh-- I just
have a few questions,
- ( phone chimes )

39:57.728 --> 39:59.522
mostly about
the property.

39:59.605 --> 40:01.607
Oh, uh, one sec.
Um...

40:01.690 --> 40:04.944
Sorry.
Wife has a question
about a house thing.

40:05.027 --> 40:08.489
-<i> ( clears throat )</i>
- Sha, na, na, na,
na, na, na, na.

40:08.572 --> 40:10.074
Uh, sorry.

40:10.157 --> 40:11.450
<i>We know</i>
<i>the murder happened</i>

40:11.534 --> 40:13.994
<i>somewhere between</i>
<i>10:15 and 11:45.</i>

40:14.078 --> 40:15.496
Do we know that
for sure?

40:15.579 --> 40:18.332
Well, Olivia was seen
leaving the party at 10:04.

40:18.415 --> 40:21.293
And then a guy
overhears her and Eric

40:21.377 --> 40:23.212
having an argument
at the studio at 10:10.

40:23.295 --> 40:24.630
Then she calls
her neighbor up the hill,

40:24.713 --> 40:28.300
and then her friend JC
at 10:16,

40:28.384 --> 40:30.094
the last anyone
ever heard from her.

40:30.177 --> 40:32.263
Oh, sidebar--

40:32.346 --> 40:34.223
you know the people
up the hill, O'Connor?

40:34.306 --> 40:36.142
<i>Do you know that</i>
<i>they own the Red Room?</i>

40:37.726 --> 40:39.979
<i>Oh, please,</i>
<i>please don't tell me</i>

40:40.062 --> 40:41.647
<i>you don't know</i>
<i>what the Red Room is.</i>

40:41.730 --> 40:44.316
Is that like
a "50 Shades of Grey" thing?

40:44.400 --> 40:46.986
( both laughing )

40:47.069 --> 40:48.696
It's a private
art collection.

40:48.779 --> 40:50.990
Individually,
some incredible pieces.

40:51.073 --> 40:53.033
Overall,
no unifying aesthetic.

40:53.117 --> 40:56.662
They had a piece
from-- from it on loan
at the Denver Art Museum,

40:56.745 --> 41:00.499
this obscure
French Impressionist,
Henri-Edmond Cross.

41:00.583 --> 41:02.209
When I was 12,
my mother and I sat

41:02.293 --> 41:03.711
<i>in front of it</i>
<i>for literally six hours.</i>

41:03.794 --> 41:05.379
Well, if you would've
told me they had,

41:05.462 --> 41:09.049
like, a Brian Bolland
or a Will Eisner or
something, then...

41:09.133 --> 41:10.509
Don't tell me
you don't know

41:10.593 --> 41:12.428
who the father
of the graphic novel is.

41:12.511 --> 41:14.096
My interest
in American art

41:14.180 --> 41:16.265
ended with Hopper's
"Intermedio" in 1963.

41:16.348 --> 41:18.642
Well, Eisner was before,
but, you know, whatever.

41:18.726 --> 41:20.477
<i>Anyhow...</i>

41:20.561 --> 41:22.229
-<i> Her wounds.</i>
- Her wounds.

41:22.313 --> 41:24.023
-<i> Yes, her wounds were--</i>
-<i> ( phone chimes )</i>

41:24.106 --> 41:25.566
<i>they were from</i>
<i>a variety of things,</i>

41:25.649 --> 41:27.193
<i>but they believe</i>
<i>the death blow to be</i>

41:27.276 --> 41:28.360
<i>from multiple</i>
<i>hammer strikes.</i>

41:28.444 --> 41:30.863
<i>And there was</i>
<i>some flesh--</i>

41:30.946 --> 41:33.115
<i>piece of flesh they found</i>
<i>on the wall, a tiny speck,</i>

41:33.199 --> 41:35.576
<i>and in it</i>
<i>were bug eggs.</i>

41:35.659 --> 41:37.995
- Sorry. Uh, wife thing.
-<i> ( phone chimes )</i>

41:38.078 --> 41:40.623
- Bug eggs.
-<i> Blowflies.</i>

41:40.706 --> 41:43.584
<i>Which puts it</i>
<i>no later than 11:45.</i>

41:43.667 --> 41:45.502
So I'm trying
to figure out

41:45.586 --> 41:49.673
who was where
between 10:15
and 11:45 p.m.

41:49.757 --> 41:52.468
Well, I can't really be
of any help on that

41:52.551 --> 41:54.595
because I was
at a 10:20 movie

41:54.678 --> 41:56.263
that was at Eastridge.

41:56.347 --> 41:59.934
So I left the property
about 9:45...

42:00.017 --> 42:03.771
or 9:46,
which I weirdly
remember.

42:05.022 --> 42:07.942
Wow, a movie
New Year's Eve.

42:08.025 --> 42:09.193
- ( clears throat )
- Crazy.

42:09.276 --> 42:11.570
I know, right?
And trust me, I, uh--

42:11.654 --> 42:13.656
I wasn't one
to avoid a party.

42:13.739 --> 42:16.408
It's just
the truth is

42:16.492 --> 42:20.329
me and my
then girlfriend,
now wife,

42:20.412 --> 42:22.248
- had had
a little fight.
-<i> ( phone chimes )</i>

42:22.331 --> 42:23.916
You weren't
texting her enough?

42:23.999 --> 42:26.168
( chuckles )
Sorry.

42:26.252 --> 42:28.254
Let me turn
this thing off.

42:30.547 --> 42:32.758
- Uh, yeah, so.
-<i> ( phone chimes )</i>

42:34.343 --> 42:36.762
<i>So, yeah, you said</i>
<i>that, you, uh,</i>

42:36.845 --> 42:39.265
<i>once saw Cameron</i>
<i>on the property</i>

42:39.348 --> 42:40.933
<i>out by the studio?</i>

42:41.016 --> 42:44.520
It was actually by
the, uh, story trail,
actually.

42:44.603 --> 42:46.563
Could you show me
exactly?

42:49.066 --> 42:50.484
Sure.

42:50.567 --> 42:52.111
Look, it's simple.

42:52.194 --> 42:54.989
All you do is find a way
to get him alone.

42:55.072 --> 42:56.699
Then you casually
bring it up

42:56.782 --> 42:59.034
and let him do the rest.

43:00.661 --> 43:03.038
Frank:
<i>Should I wear a wire?</i>

43:03.122 --> 43:05.416
Wha-- no.

43:05.499 --> 43:07.334
Why?

43:07.418 --> 43:10.504
- Wha-- are you joking?
- Well, I don't know.

43:10.587 --> 43:14.133
- Whenever this happens
on "The Wire"--
- "The Wire."

43:14.216 --> 43:16.969
It's called "The Wire,"

43:17.052 --> 43:20.597
so, yes, of course
they have wires.

43:22.349 --> 43:24.184
But this is Summit, man.

43:24.268 --> 43:26.145
We don't have wires.

43:26.228 --> 43:29.982
We just have
one guy says something

43:30.065 --> 43:31.775
and another guy
tells a third guy.

43:31.859 --> 43:33.736
Okay.

43:33.819 --> 43:35.237
Hey!

43:35.321 --> 43:37.656
All you need
to do is this.

43:37.740 --> 43:40.826
If he asks you
to stick to the story

43:40.909 --> 43:44.830
or to continue the lie
in any way,

43:44.913 --> 43:46.415
you just tell me.

43:52.713 --> 43:55.382
Frank,
what's the matter?

43:55.466 --> 43:57.051
We didn't even know
about the murder

43:57.134 --> 43:58.886
when we agreed to this.

43:58.969 --> 44:02.681
Ah. Dude,
you're not in trouble.

44:04.266 --> 44:05.434
Okay.

44:07.227 --> 44:09.438
You swear to God?

44:09.521 --> 44:11.982
- Yes.
- Is Joel?

44:12.066 --> 44:13.859
I don't know.

44:15.819 --> 44:16.820
Maybe not.

44:16.904 --> 44:18.781
Hopefully not.
Hey, hopefully not.

44:18.864 --> 44:21.533
Enough to get this girl
to bring him back up here.

44:21.617 --> 44:23.702
- ( scoffs )
- Doesn't mean
that he's in trouble.

44:23.786 --> 44:25.913
He's just-- he's--

44:25.996 --> 44:28.207
( sighs )
he's of interest.

44:28.290 --> 44:31.210
- How the fuck did she get him
to come back anyway?
-<i> ( phone chimes )</i>

44:34.004 --> 44:37.549
Oh, you gotta be
freaking kidding me!

44:37.633 --> 44:38.842
She brought him
to the site.

44:38.926 --> 44:40.219
I gotta go.

44:40.302 --> 44:42.179
Hold on.
What do I do?

44:42.262 --> 44:46.183
What do you mean?
Stay, eat.

44:46.266 --> 44:48.560
- But no acting, all right?
- ( sighs )

44:48.644 --> 44:50.771
Don't act, just--

44:50.854 --> 44:52.856
just be normal,
man, all right?

44:52.940 --> 44:54.817
Joel:
So, her one big book--

44:54.900 --> 44:56.151
well, I'm sure
you read it.

44:56.235 --> 44:57.736
Everyone's read it.

44:57.820 --> 44:58.904
- ( chuckles )
- Mm-mm.

44:58.987 --> 45:00.781
No?

45:00.864 --> 45:03.033
"Whose Woods These Are."

45:03.117 --> 45:06.078
You read it one way,
it's the story of
this poor hunter

45:06.161 --> 45:09.873
who tries to protect his family
from this evil monster bear.

45:09.957 --> 45:12.376
You turn it over
and read it the other way,

45:12.459 --> 45:15.504
it's the story
of this poor bear
who tries to rescue his mom

45:15.587 --> 45:18.424
from the trap
of this evil monster hunter.

45:18.507 --> 45:21.593
- Hmm.
- Not a bad idea, right.

45:21.677 --> 45:24.680
- Pick a direction.
- Wherever Cameron was.

45:24.763 --> 45:27.766
Well, it's a circle.
They both end up at
the same place.

45:29.184 --> 45:31.353
Good choice.

45:31.437 --> 45:34.731
So anyway, she'd lead
these "story walks,"
she'd called them--

45:34.815 --> 45:38.610
Cub Scouts,
field trips,
Girl Scouts.

45:38.694 --> 45:42.197
- It was like she'd never tire
of telling her one story.
- ( phone chimes )

45:42.281 --> 45:44.950
- Petra: Well, that's sweet.
- Well, I guess.

45:45.033 --> 45:48.495
Or she just couldn't
move on, maybe.

45:48.579 --> 45:51.331
Anyways, at night
when I'd just need
to clear my head,

45:51.415 --> 45:53.792
I'd come out here
and I'd walk the property.

45:53.876 --> 45:56.712
So, on that night,
I'm walking along,
and all of a sudden-- boom--

45:56.795 --> 46:01.633
he and this other guy,
like I just caught them
at something, right here.

46:01.717 --> 46:04.428
Then they just disappeared
off into the dark.

46:04.511 --> 46:07.556
- And so you--
- Went to the main house,
which is right over here,

46:07.639 --> 46:08.557
and I told
your brother.

46:09.600 --> 46:10.976
Where'd you live?

46:13.020 --> 46:16.231
In the barn.
( laughs )

46:16.315 --> 46:18.275
I was there with
all the other strays.

46:18.358 --> 46:20.235
She was always
picking up strays--

46:20.319 --> 46:22.529
cats, dogs, people.

46:23.614 --> 46:24.823
You lived in a barn?

46:24.907 --> 46:27.618
( chuckling )
Well, I grew up on a farm.

46:27.701 --> 46:28.785
She had horses.

46:28.869 --> 46:30.829
Seemed like
a good idea.

46:30.913 --> 46:34.833
And then the reality was
I was just a guy
living in a barn.

46:34.917 --> 46:37.544
Not the idea you had
when you first got here,
I assume.

46:37.628 --> 46:39.213
It's a long story.

46:39.296 --> 46:40.714
You ever meet her?

46:40.797 --> 46:44.760
Once,
at Thanksgiving.

46:44.843 --> 46:46.136
Not so fun?

46:46.220 --> 46:48.013
( laughs )

46:48.096 --> 46:50.015
It was an attempt.

46:50.098 --> 46:52.684
Eric:
<i>But I can tell</i>
<i>there is no chance</i>

46:52.768 --> 46:55.062
<i>this Dennis Klein guy</i>

46:55.145 --> 46:56.188
is legit.

46:56.271 --> 46:57.481
One thing we know

46:57.564 --> 47:00.067
is what a scam artist
looks like.

47:00.150 --> 47:02.402
Am I right?
So, I'm like--

47:02.486 --> 47:04.655
Olivia:
He says, "If I'm not
absolutely right,

47:04.738 --> 47:06.323
you have to buy me
a drink."

47:06.406 --> 47:08.909
Eric:
And whammo, to a tee.

47:08.992 --> 47:10.702
<i>( piano music playing )</i>

47:10.786 --> 47:13.080
Olivia:
So, then he starts
telling me why he's here.

47:13.163 --> 47:14.998
Why was Eric here?

47:15.082 --> 47:17.251
Wanted to change his life,
didn't want to be
the Grim Reaper--

47:17.334 --> 47:20.295
Actually, hon, I feel
like I'm monopolizing
this whole thing.

47:20.379 --> 47:23.257
Petra,
what do you do?

47:23.340 --> 47:24.925
- Eric: She is...
- Petra: I do many things.

47:25.008 --> 47:27.594
- ...major into the art world.
- Peripherally.

47:27.678 --> 47:29.513
She restores art,

47:29.596 --> 47:30.764
she teaches,
she writes books.

47:30.847 --> 47:32.349
- ( clears throat )
- Olivia: About?

47:32.432 --> 47:34.977
She got 600 pages

47:35.060 --> 47:37.938
into one about
the Italian Divisionists--

47:38.021 --> 47:39.773
see, I read
your e-mails--

47:39.856 --> 47:41.400
and then she's like,
"Wait a minute,

47:41.483 --> 47:43.235
maybe those critics
back at the"--

47:43.318 --> 47:44.736
- whatever they're called...
- Salons.

47:44.820 --> 47:46.071
"The ones who trashed
the Divisionists

47:46.154 --> 47:47.531
back in the day,
maybe they were right."

47:47.614 --> 47:49.491
And she throws
her book away
and starts again.

47:49.575 --> 47:51.577
Olivia:
Well, they were
right, right?

47:51.660 --> 47:54.538
I mean, when was that?
Like, 1894?

47:54.621 --> 47:55.956
- Petra: '96.
- '96.

47:56.039 --> 47:57.791
Well, they were spot-on.

47:57.875 --> 48:01.378
Well, my beef was
the overt social
overtones--

48:01.461 --> 48:02.629
Olivia:
<i>Oh, I get your beef.</i>

48:02.713 --> 48:04.131
<i>I'm totally with you.</i>
<i>I get it.</i>

48:04.214 --> 48:05.632
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>the powerful are corrupt.</i>

48:05.716 --> 48:07.884
<i>Art is needed</i>
<i>by the disinherited.</i>

48:07.968 --> 48:10.470
I mean, if I want a message,
send me a fucking telegram.

48:10.554 --> 48:13.473
Yeah, Olivia,
1943 just called.

48:13.557 --> 48:15.142
They'd like
their once topical

48:15.225 --> 48:16.852
"send me a telegram"
reference back.

48:16.935 --> 48:19.313
- ( guests chuckling )
- Olivia: Hello, JC.

48:19.396 --> 48:21.481
Hello, 2007 called,

48:21.565 --> 48:24.651
<i>and they want</i>
<i>their fill-in-the-blank</i>
<i>call joke back.</i>

48:24.735 --> 48:27.571
<i>( laughter )</i>

48:27.654 --> 48:28.822
Olivia:
<i>It's all overrated--</i>

48:28.905 --> 48:30.616
<i>the neos,</i>
<i>the pointillists.</i>

48:30.699 --> 48:33.910
Really? You don't think
understanding the science

48:33.994 --> 48:35.495
of how the eye
perceives light is--

48:35.579 --> 48:37.664
<i>Has nothing</i>
<i>to do with art.</i>

48:37.748 --> 48:38.915
<i>I mean, come on.</i>

48:38.999 --> 48:42.169
Yeah, can we measure
human emotions

48:42.252 --> 48:44.546
through the chemical,
the synaptical,

48:44.630 --> 48:49.760
the sciency-wiency--
whatever-- events?

48:49.843 --> 48:51.178
Sure.

48:51.261 --> 48:53.347
But at the core of it,

48:53.430 --> 48:57.059
end of day,
you have to feel it.

48:57.142 --> 48:59.978
You can't think art...

49:00.062 --> 49:02.856
( exhales )
...teach art,
write about it.

49:02.939 --> 49:04.399
JC:
Um, didn't
we just establish

49:04.483 --> 49:06.902
she thinks, teaches,
and writes about art?

49:06.985 --> 49:09.237
<i>( laughter )</i>

49:09.321 --> 49:13.492
Olivia:
<i>The most beautiful</i>
<i>piece of art I've ever seen</i>

49:13.575 --> 49:17.329
<i>was drawn by</i>
<i>an 11-year-old girl</i>
<i>in 15 minutes.</i>

49:17.412 --> 49:19.289
<i>It-- it's no technique.</i>

49:19.373 --> 49:22.709
<i>But it was raw,</i>
<i>it was pure.</i>

49:22.793 --> 49:24.294
<i>( chuckles )</i>

49:24.378 --> 49:26.296
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>it was about me,</i>

49:26.380 --> 49:29.174
<i>so, maybe I'm exaggerating</i>
<i>a little bit.</i>

49:29.257 --> 49:31.885
<i>Just eat your pie.</i>
<i>Sorry.</i>

49:31.968 --> 49:34.680
<i>( music playing )</i>
