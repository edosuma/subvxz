- STINKS.

12:48.017 --> 12:49.101
- WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

12:49.185 --> 12:51.729
- I HAVE EVERYTHING
UNDER CONTROL, VICTOR.

12:51.812 --> 12:54.857
- I BEG TO DIFFER, MR. SWEET.

12:54.940 --> 12:56.859
IT APPEARS TO ME
THAT WHAT YOU HAVE HERE

12:56.942 --> 12:59.528
IS A CLASS FULL OF DUNCES

12:59.612 --> 13:03.741
WHO SHOULD NOT BE INTERFERING IN
THINGS THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND.

13:03.824 --> 13:04.867
[coughs]

13:08.287 --> 13:10.539
- IS IT JUST ME, OR WAS VICTOR
ON THE SCENE A BIT TOO QUICK?

13:10.623 --> 13:13.834
LIKE HE WAS WATCHING US?

13:13.918 --> 13:14.627
WEIRD.

13:14.710 --> 13:17.046
- I HAD A DREAM LAST NIGHT.

13:17.129 --> 13:18.088
SENKHARA WAS THERE,

13:18.172 --> 13:22.635
AND SHE SAID THE RAVEN
IS WATCHING.

13:22.718 --> 13:23.969
IT MUST MEAN VICTOR.

13:24.053 --> 13:27.056
- MAYBE WE SHOULD WATCH HIM
AND FIND OUT.

13:27.139 --> 13:28.807
- THAT WAS AWESOME SAUCE!

13:28.891 --> 13:32.186
IF I WAS A CRAZY MAD SCIENTIST,
I COULD DO THIS FOR A LIVING.

13:32.269 --> 13:34.313
RIGHT, MARA?

13:44.448 --> 13:46.325
- AHA.

13:46.408 --> 13:48.452
OH, INTERESTING.

13:53.374 --> 13:56.168
[clears throat]

13:57.670 --> 13:58.170
- VICTOR, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:58.254 --> 13:59.213
- WHO, ME?

13:59.296 --> 14:00.506
OH, NOTHING.

14:00.589 --> 14:03.050
UH, JUST SOME LIGHT READING.

14:03.133 --> 14:05.261
- YOU'RE RESEARCHING A TASK,
AREN'T YOU?

14:05.344 --> 14:06.303
WE AGREED.

14:06.387 --> 14:09.598
- VERA,

14:09.682 --> 14:12.059
IT IS GOING TO TAKE YEARS
OF EXPERIENCE

14:12.142 --> 14:16.438
AND FINE-TUNED UNDERSTANDING
OF CHEMICAL COMPOSITION

14:16.522 --> 14:17.648
AND ALCHEMY TO COMPLETE
THIS TASK.

14:17.731 --> 14:19.775
- THAT MAY WELL BE THE CASE,

14:19.858 --> 14:21.277
BUT YOU RISK GIVING
OUR GAME AWAY.

14:21.360 --> 14:22.444
- YES,

14:22.528 --> 14:26.365
AND WE SHALL HAVE NO GAME
IF THEY FAIL,

14:26.448 --> 14:29.952
ESPECIALLY NOT WITH A LIABILITY
LIKE ALFIE LEWIS ON THEIR SIDE.

14:30.035 --> 14:33.330
HE'S QUITE LIKELY TO BLOW UP
THE TUNNEL

14:33.414 --> 14:36.083
AND BLOCK OFF
THE MASK COMPLETELY.

14:36.166 --> 14:37.459
- DON'T LOSE SIGHT OF OUR PLAN.

14:37.543 --> 14:41.297
WE MUSTN'T SHOW OUT HAND
AND GIVE THEM THE ADVANTAGE.

14:41.380 --> 14:43.382
PLEASE.

14:51.974 --> 14:52.641
- WELL?

14:52.725 --> 14:55.269
WHAT'D SHE THINK?

14:55.352 --> 14:58.147
- THIS IS VERY IMPRESSIVE WORK,
MARA.

14:58.230 --> 15:01.609
I ALWAYS THOUGHT VERA'S RESUME
WAS A LITTLE CASUAL

15:01.692 --> 15:03.485
WITH THE TRUTH.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.279
- CASUAL?

15:05.362 --> 15:08.365
EVERYONE NAMED ON THERE
IS EITHER DEAD, DOESN'T EXIST,

15:08.449 --> 15:10.659
OR REFUSES TO TALK ABOUT HER.

15:10.743 --> 15:11.994
VERA ISN'T WHO SHE SAYS SHE IS.

15:15.456 --> 15:16.457
- WHAT'S THAT?

15:16.540 --> 15:18.667
- MY EXPOSE FOR THE WEBSITE.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.044
I WANT TO GO PUBLIC.

15:20.127 --> 15:22.880
- MARA, I ONLY ASKED
FOR A GENTLE PROFILE.

15:22.963 --> 15:26.342
- THE WORLD MUST KNOW
WHAT SHE'S LIKE.

15:26.425 --> 15:29.511
- WE HAVE TO GO BY THE BOOK.

15:29.595 --> 15:32.931
I'LL SPEAK WITH MR. SWEET,
AND IF ALL THIS CHECKS OUT,

15:33.015 --> 15:34.725
THEN YOU CAN HAVE YOUR SCOOP.

15:34.808 --> 15:36.727
- OLD NEWS IS NO NEWS,
MRS. ANDREWS.

15:40.356 --> 15:44.860
- EDDIE PRACTICALLY BEGGED ME
TO PUNK HIM THE OTHER DAY.

15:44.943 --> 15:46.028
IT WAS KIND OF UNDIGNIFIED.

15:48.697 --> 15:49.948
WHAT?

15:50.032 --> 15:53.702
- WELL, OBVIOUSLY HE WANTS YOU
TO KEEP PRANKING HIM.

15:53.786 --> 15:54.912
HE'S LOVING THE ATTENTION.

15:54.995 --> 15:56.622
SHOWS YOU CARE.

15:56.705 --> 15:59.208
- PRETTY MESSED UP.

15:59.291 --> 16:01.210
- SO IF YOU BOTH KNOW
THE GROUND RULES,

16:01.293 --> 16:04.171
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

16:04.254 --> 16:05.881
- HE GETS TO ME.

16:05.964 --> 16:08.175
HE KNOWS I LIKE HIM.

16:08.258 --> 16:09.635
AND HE KNOWS THAT MAKES ME--

16:09.718 --> 16:10.928
- HUMAN?

16:11.011 --> 16:12.096
- WEAK.

16:12.179 --> 16:13.722
- TRY CHASING A BOY
WHO'S STILL CRAZY

16:13.806 --> 16:15.974
ABOUT THE GIRL HE BROKE UP WITH.

16:16.058 --> 16:17.726
- YOU GONNA GIVE UP ON IT?

16:17.810 --> 16:18.227
- NO.

16:18.310 --> 16:19.311
NOT YET.

16:19.395 --> 16:22.147
YOU?

16:26.193 --> 16:27.403
[Ping-Pong slapping]

16:27.486 --> 16:28.070
- DUDE!

16:28.153 --> 16:29.905
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:29.988 --> 16:31.740
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR
A NEW PING-PONG PARTNER?

16:31.824 --> 16:34.076
- WHY WOULD YOU EVEN THINK THAT?

16:34.159 --> 16:35.077
- [scoffs]

16:35.160 --> 16:36.495
IT SAYS,
"BE MY PING-PONG PARTNER."

16:36.578 --> 16:39.790
- AH...
YES.

16:39.873 --> 16:40.749
I SUPPOSE I AM.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.042
- WHAT ABOUT OUR DEAL?

16:42.126 --> 16:42.835
YOU GAVE ME YOUR WORD.

16:42.918 --> 16:43.877
THIS WAS MY CHANCE TO SHINE!

16:43.961 --> 16:46.714
- YEAH, AND YOU STILL MIGHT,
BUT...

16:46.797 --> 16:49.299
LOOK, YOU SAW THE OTHER TEAM.

16:49.383 --> 16:52.136
WE CAN'T TAKE ANY CHANCES,
RIGHT?

16:52.219 --> 16:56.056
- COME ON, MAN,
YOU'RE STILL ON THE LIST.

16:56.140 --> 16:57.474
- NO, I'M NOT!

16:57.558 --> 16:59.601
- YEAH, UM...

17:01.645 --> 17:03.814
YOU ARE NOW.

17:03.897 --> 17:05.691
SUIT UP.

17:05.773 --> 17:07.776
AND SHOW THESE LOSERS--
NO OFFENSE--

17:07.859 --> 17:10.570
HOW THE ALF-MEISTER ROLLS.

17:10.654 --> 17:11.446
YEAH.

17:11.530 --> 17:12.614
- COMING THROUGH.
SORRY.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.742
'SCUSE ME.

17:16.617 --> 17:17.286
- RIGHT.

17:17.368 --> 17:20.038
WAIT, NO, GUYS--
WHAT?

17:25.961 --> 17:27.796
- COME ON!
YOU CANNOT BE SERIOUS!

17:27.880 --> 17:30.174
- ALFIE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:30.257 --> 17:32.259
- I'M DEMONSTRATING MY PASSION.

17:32.342 --> 17:35.095
- HOW ABOUT DEMONSTRATING
A BIT OF AIM?

17:35.179 --> 17:38.599
NEXT!

17:38.682 --> 17:39.850
- [laughs]

17:39.933 --> 17:41.143
AND THE CLEAR WINNER
IS ALFIE LEWIS!

17:41.226 --> 17:42.227
YES!

17:44.605 --> 17:47.441
- WAIT.
WHAT?

17:53.113 --> 17:54.406
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

17:54.490 --> 17:55.491
- DO WHAT?

17:55.574 --> 17:57.826
- DO IT AGAIN.

17:57.910 --> 17:58.827
- DO WHAT AGAIN?

17:58.911 --> 18:00.954
I DIDN'T--

18:02.831 --> 18:06.126
- YOU'RE AMAZING.

18:06.210 --> 18:09.379
- THANK YOU, JEROME,
BUT I ALREADY KNEW THAT.

18:09.463 --> 18:11.632
- I NEED YOU TO BE MY PARTNER.

18:11.715 --> 18:13.342
PLEASE.
I'M BEGGING YOU.

18:13.425 --> 18:15.219
- OH, WHEN YOU PUT IT THAT WAY,

18:15.302 --> 18:16.178
NO.

18:16.261 --> 18:17.471
I GOT SICK OF PING-PONG

18:17.554 --> 18:19.973
WHEN I WAS UNDER-13
COUNTY PING-PONG CHAMPION.

18:20.057 --> 18:21.183
[together]
UNDER-13 COUNTY

18:21.266 --> 18:23.435
PING-PONG CHAMPION?

18:23.519 --> 18:26.355
- THREE YEARS RUNNING.

18:26.438 --> 18:27.523
- THREE YEARS RUNNING.

18:27.606 --> 18:30.317
SORRY, ALFIE.

18:34.780 --> 18:38.033
- NO.

18:38.116 --> 18:39.535
- FOR THE FAME,

18:39.618 --> 18:40.953
FORTUNE,

18:41.036 --> 18:42.079
IMMORTALITY.

18:42.162 --> 18:43.872
OKAY, IT'S NONE OF THOSE THINGS,
AMBER,

18:43.956 --> 18:46.375
BUT I WILL MAKE SURE

18:46.458 --> 18:49.795
THAT YOU GET TO WEAR
A REALLY CUTE OUTFIT.

18:49.878 --> 18:51.046
- NO OFFENSE, JEROME,

18:51.129 --> 18:53.549
BUT I HAVE TO INSIST
YOU LEAVE THE OUTFITS TO ME.

18:53.632 --> 18:56.385
- AGREED.

18:56.468 --> 18:57.553
SO YOU'LL DO IT?

18:57.636 --> 18:59.596
YES!

18:59.680 --> 19:01.974
THANK YOU!
THANK YOU!

19:02.057 --> 19:04.059
YES!

19:23.704 --> 19:25.038
- I'VE GOT A BAD FEELING
ABOUT THIS.

19:25.122 --> 19:26.164
COME ON.

19:40.512 --> 19:44.349
WHAT'S HE DOING
ALL THOSE CHEMICALS?

19:44.433 --> 19:46.059
- YOU THINK HE'S WORKING
ON THE TASK?

19:46.143 --> 19:47.519
- HOW DOES HE KNOW ABOUT IT?

19:47.603 --> 19:48.604
HE DOESN'T HAVE AN AMULET?

19:48.687 --> 19:51.189
- I JUST KNOW THAT VICTOR
PLUS CELLAR

19:51.273 --> 19:52.357
USUALLY EQUALS BAD NEWS.

19:55.569 --> 19:58.071
MAYBE HE'S BREWING ELIXIR.

19:58.155 --> 19:58.697
- OH, AGAIN?

19:58.780 --> 19:59.656
GOOD.

19:59.740 --> 20:02.534
- NO, NOT GOOD.

20:05.662 --> 20:07.789
- ACCEPT IT.

20:07.873 --> 20:09.583
COME ON, YOU'RE
A GOODY-TWO-SHOES

20:09.666 --> 20:10.459
WITH SPRINKLES ON TOP.

20:10.542 --> 20:11.543
WHEN YOU'RE NOT IN SCHOOL,

20:11.627 --> 20:13.795
YOU SPEND YOUR FREE TIME
BLOGGING ABOUT IT.

20:13.879 --> 20:14.963
IT'S SICK.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.299
- ARE YOU HERE TO CONTRIBUTE,

20:17.382 --> 20:18.717
OR ARE YOU JUST KILLING TIME

20:18.800 --> 20:20.802
UNTIL YOUR TEACHER BUDDIES
CLOCK OUT?

20:20.886 --> 20:22.721
- COME ON.

20:22.804 --> 20:24.181
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE

20:24.264 --> 20:25.432
BEFORE YOU RUN OUT OF MEAN
THINGS TO SAY TO EACH OTHER.

20:28.810 --> 20:29.853
- [snorts]

20:33.732 --> 20:37.319
- THERE'S SOME REALLY
INTERESTING INFORMATION ON HERE.

20:37.402 --> 20:39.237
- YOU'RE REALLY THINK SO?

20:39.321 --> 20:41.156
- NO.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.324
IF I COULD SWAP MY EYEBALLS
AND WIPE AWAY

20:42.407 --> 20:44.826
THE PART OF MY BRAIN
THAT NOW HOLDS

20:44.910 --> 20:47.788
THIS INCREDIBLY BORING
INFORMATION, I WOULD.

20:47.871 --> 20:49.331
[laughs]

20:49.414 --> 20:51.667
- HEY, DON'T HOLD BACK
TO SAVE MY FEELINGS.

20:51.750 --> 20:55.379
- MARA, I AM.

20:55.462 --> 20:56.380
- [groans]

20:56.463 --> 20:57.798
YOU'RE RIGHT,

20:57.881 --> 20:59.633
AND IT'S TERRIBLE
BECAUSE I SPENT ALL MY TIME

20:59.716 --> 21:01.218
RESEARCHING ANOTHER STORY.

21:01.301 --> 21:02.511
- WHAT STORY?

21:02.594 --> 21:04.721
- JUST THE GREATEST SCOOP
OF THE DECADE.

21:04.805 --> 21:08.016
- OKAY, WELL, LET'S PUT IT
ONLINE, AND LET'S READ IT.

21:09.226 --> 21:10.769
- [moans]
I CAN'T.

21:10.852 --> 21:12.104
I PROMISED.

21:12.187 --> 21:15.107
IT'S ABOUT ONE OF THE STAFF.

21:15.190 --> 21:18.318
- WHAT ARE YOU, A TEACHERS' PET?

21:18.402 --> 21:21.780
I MEAN, COME ON.
YOU'RE BETTER THAN THIS.

21:21.863 --> 21:23.782
AND IF THE STORY'S GOOD,
INCLUDE IT.

21:25.534 --> 21:29.538
- IT IS THE TRUTH,
AND IF I DON'T,

21:29.621 --> 21:31.206
IT MIGHT GET BRUSHED
UNDER THE CARPET.

21:31.289 --> 21:32.332
- MM-HMM.

21:43.635 --> 21:44.761
- [sputtering laughter]

21:44.845 --> 21:46.722
OKAY, NOW THAT'S A SCOOP.

21:48.473 --> 21:49.307
DO IT.

21:49.391 --> 21:50.559
WHAT, ARE YOU CHICKEN?

21:50.642 --> 21:52.060
- NO.
- DO IT.

21:52.144 --> 21:54.980
YOU HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY AS A
JOURNALIST TO REPORT THE TRUTH.

21:58.650 --> 22:00.652
- I PRESS THIS KEY,

22:00.736 --> 22:02.946
AND THE STORY GOES LIVE.

22:03.030 --> 22:06.324
EVERYONE WILL READ IT.

22:06.408 --> 22:07.409
- DO IT.
