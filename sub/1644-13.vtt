00:14.348 --> 00:15.433
Bill, don't do this.

00:15.641 --> 00:18.394

SLATTERY: You are under arrest
for the murder of Roy William Geary.

00:32.200 --> 00:34.660
My therapist said
that I need to confront you...

00:34.827 --> 00:36.996

MAN:

Just as long as you do your job,
we'll forget about Shales.

00:43.711 --> 00:46.839
And then you can go back to Colorado
and visit your son, Cameron.

00:49.133 --> 00:50.843
Don't you ever mention his name again.

00:51.010 --> 00:52.428
What about your friend there?

00:52.595 --> 00:56.432
If we're gonna go down,
might as well go down swinging.

01:19.956 --> 01:21.749

- Get up.</i>

01:25.253 --> 01:26.879
Turn around.

01:27.421 --> 01:28.464
Turn around!

01:28.756 --> 01:32.551
If you're gonna murder us, Alex, you have
to look us in the eyes while you do it.

01:32.718 --> 01:34.553
- Shut up.
- You want me, you got me.

01:34.720 --> 01:36.055
Let my brother go!

01:36.222 --> 01:39.058
I don't want either of you.
I just want my life back!

01:39.225 --> 01:41.227
You're gonna kill two innocent men
to get it, huh?

01:41.394 --> 01:42.645
Absolutely.

Hands on your head now!

Don't move.

03:15.071 --> 03:17.281
We're in the middle of the desert.

03:17.573 --> 03:20.159

<i>...just a few miles north

<i>Federal Agent Mahone, with assistance

03:57.863 --> 04:00.449

05:09.852 --> 05:11.479
BAG-WELL:
Excuse me, sarge.

05:12.021 --> 05:14.773
I was wondering if you
could help a brother out.

05:14.940 --> 05:16.275
With What?

05:16.859 --> 05:20.821
I only recently returned from delivering
democracy to the desert...

05:20.988 --> 05:24.617
...and I was wondering
if you could tell me...

05:24.783 --> 05:27.786
...how a guy goes about getting
one of those prosthetic jobbies.

05:28.829 --> 05:31.123
Didn't they make you whole
before they shipped you?

05:31.290 --> 05:36.545
Let's just say the doctor made the bed,
he just neglected to tuck in the sheets.

05:37.296 --> 05:41.008
Best thing for you to do is go on
down there to the VA, get in line.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.302
That simple?

05:43.427 --> 05:44.970
Yeah.

05:45.387 --> 05:47.973
Till they send you the bill,
and you gotta pay it.

05:48.140 --> 05:50.559
Those bastards in Washington
send us to fight for them.

05:50.726 --> 05:54.396
- Not a damn one of them fights for us.
- Man, that is a crime.

05:55.564 --> 05:58.108
But luckily for me, uh...

05:58.776 --> 06:00.236
...money is not the issue.

06:00.778 --> 06:01.820
Is that right?

06:01.987 --> 06:06.242
Any particular forms I might need
in order to qualify?

06:06.408 --> 06:09.328
You know what,
Mr. Don't-Ask-Don't-Tell?

06:10.037 --> 06:12.581
You figured out how to dye
that hair of yours...

06:12.748 --> 06:14.583
...up like a nancy all by yourself.

06:14.750 --> 06:17.336
You sure as hell can figure out
how to get a prosthetic...

06:17.503 --> 06:19.755
...for that stump of yours by yourself.

06:23.133 --> 06:28.097
Yeah, I think I got a pretty good idea
where to start.

06:43.279 --> 06:46.490
I'm here with Ed Pavelka, the
new warden of Fox River Penitentiary...

06:46.657 --> 06:48.784
...where Lincoln Burrows
and Michael Scofield...

06:48.951 --> 06:51.370
...are scheduled to be returned to
some time tomorrow.

06:51.537 --> 06:53.789
Now, warden, the escape happened
a mere two days...

06:53.956 --> 06:56.250
...before Burrows was scheduled
to be put to death.

06:56.417 --> 06:59.920
He's already been granted one day.
Do you anticipate any further?

07:00.087 --> 07:03.299
Lincoln Burrows is a convicted murderer.

07:03.465 --> 07:06.802
His escape has endangered the lives
of civilians across this country.

07:06.969 --> 07:10.222
He is not a celebrity. He is not a martyr.

07:10.848 --> 07:14.977
I can assure you that whatever leniency
was afforded him and other prisoners...

07:15.144 --> 07:18.522
...under the old regime at Fox River
will no longer be tolerated.

07:18.689 --> 07:23.152
The only thing that Burrows can expect
is what a jury of his peers demanded:

07:23.944 --> 07:25.237
A speedy execution.

07:25.404 --> 07:27.323
And Michael Scofield?

07:27.489 --> 07:30.326
With his escape,
the aiding and abetting charges...

07:30.492 --> 07:34.747
...the felonies he's racked up along the
way on top of his original sentence...

07:34.913 --> 07:39.460
...I'd say Scofield will be spending the
rest of his life behind bars. Thank you.

07:39.627 --> 07:41.879
REPORTER:
Warden, one more question, sir.

08:18.749 --> 08:20.668
WHEELER:
Who's got Mahone?

08:23.962 --> 08:26.006
- Congratulations, sir.
- What do you got?

08:26.173 --> 08:27.883
Uh, a call from the Illinois DOC.

08:28.050 --> 08:30.844
They're sending a contingent
to collect Burrows and Scofield...

08:31.011 --> 08:32.513
...take them back to Fox River.

08:32.679 --> 08:35.724
Remind them this is a federal case,
we'll handle transport. Now--

08:35.890 --> 08:37.976
It's an election year.
Collar this big, everybody wants a piece.

08:39.395 --> 08:41.397
Warden called in a favor
to the Bureau chief.

08:41.563 --> 08:43.065
<i>He okayed it, so here we are.</i>

08:43.232 --> 08:44.900
<i>Should be there in about an hour.</i>

08:45.567 --> 08:48.195
I wanna be placed
in the prisoner-transport vehicle.

08:48.362 --> 08:50.656
- What for?
- Just get it done.

08:51.240 --> 08:55.119
Sir, these were the big fish,
and you brought them in.

08:55.285 --> 08:57.621
You should feel good about that.

08:58.747 --> 09:00.082
Yeah.

09:00.791 --> 09:02.209
Yeah.

09:03.419 --> 09:05.212
<i>LINCOLN:
Well, at least We 're together.</i>

09:05.379 --> 09:07.548
Yes, there is that.

09:11.260 --> 09:12.428
What are you thinking?

09:12.594 --> 09:14.638
Thinking about the old man.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.767
What he tried to do, you know.

09:20.519 --> 09:22.896
Tough to go down swinging
when you're locked in a box.

09:25.190 --> 09:27.943
MICHAEL: This isn't over yet.
We're entitled to a phone call.

09:28.110 --> 09:31.613
We make that call to Sara and she has
the information Dad said she has...

09:31.780 --> 09:34.199
...we can get you exonerated
before this thing goes down.

09:34.366 --> 09:36.285
- Michael, it's...
MICHAEL: Hey.

09:39.037 --> 09:40.789
We're entitled to a phone call.

09:40.956 --> 09:45.127
You're entitled to precisely squat
until you're officially in custody.

09:45.294 --> 09:49.715
And that won't happen until you're back
in Fox River, so sit tight.

09:54.762 --> 09:56.096
It's not over yet.

09:56.472 --> 09:57.890
Not yet.

09:59.349 --> 10:01.769
A lot of ground to cover
between here and Illinois.

10:02.603 --> 10:03.896
I mean...

10:04.062 --> 10:06.815
What are the chances
we even make it to Fox River alive?

10:12.237 --> 10:13.697
<i>KIM:
Saw you on the news, Alex.</i>

10:13.864 --> 10:16.116
<i>- Did you?
- The brothers I00.</i>

10:16.658 --> 10:18.786
They were a little more, um...

10:18.952 --> 10:20.996
...breathing than I'd hoped.

10:21.163 --> 10:22.790
Yeah, well, Border Patrol showed up.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.666
- Nothing I could do.
- Really?

10:25.334 --> 10:28.670
Burrows and Scofield,
can you see them from where you are?

10:29.463 --> 10:33.133
- Yeah .
- <i>Then put a bullet in their heads.</i>

10:33.801 --> 10:36.678
- They're being watched.
-/ don't care.

10:36.845 --> 10:37.888
<i>By armed guards.</i>

10:38.096 --> 10:41.475
They make it back to Fox River,
it is over for all of us.

10:41.642 --> 10:44.770
<i>Not much more this country lo ves
than a bad man with a good story.</i>

10:44.937 --> 10:47.356
How much longer do you think
it'll be before someone...

10:47.523 --> 10:50.526
-...puts a microphone in front of them?
- Hey, are you listening?

10:50.692 --> 10:54.196
With the security here, what you're
asking me to do is tantamount to suicide.

10:54.363 --> 10:57.616
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- I wasn't asking anything.

10:57.783 --> 11:00.202
That would imply
you had a say in the matter.

11:01.995 --> 11:05.916
Pull this off and you
are halfway home, Alex.

11:06.542 --> 11:09.378
You remember what home is like,
don't you?

11:09.545 --> 11:12.798
9O West End Avenue.
White fence, red door.

11:12.965 --> 11:14.675
You stay away from my family.

12:12.524 --> 12:15.485
Ahem. You got
a little something on your, uh...

12:16.403 --> 12:18.280
No. Here, let me.

12:19.364 --> 12:21.116
I'm so--

12:21.950 --> 12:24.578
- Pardon my forwardness. I--
- It's okay. Thank you.

12:24.745 --> 12:26.121
Normally, I wouldn't intervene.

12:26.288 --> 12:30.626
It's just, yesterday when I was--
I got home from work...

12:30.792 --> 12:33.629
...I found what looked like
the Brazilian rain forest...

12:33.795 --> 12:35.589
...lodged between my two front teeth.

12:36.173 --> 12:40.802
All I could think about was the number
of people who must've seen, and not...

12:40.969 --> 12:43.472
Not a damn one of them
had the decency to tell me.

12:45.641 --> 12:47.559
Mild diastema.

12:47.935 --> 12:49.227
Excuse me?

12:50.604 --> 12:53.941
It's a slight gap
between your eight and nine.

12:54.608 --> 12:56.276
Your two front teeth.

12:56.443 --> 13:00.197
And that it sometimes can act
as a magnet for food...

13:00.864 --> 13:04.326
...like broccoli and tuna,
and sometimes rice.

13:04.493 --> 13:05.994
Or relish.

13:06.161 --> 13:07.996
All this and brains too?

13:08.163 --> 13:11.833
- What are you a dentist or a...?
- Me? No. Hardly, no.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.502
I could never.

13:13.669 --> 13:16.505
- My ex. My ex-husband, he was--
- A bastard?

13:17.923 --> 13:19.633
That too.

13:28.517 --> 13:30.769
Have you ever been to Italy, uh...?

13:31.687 --> 13:35.482
- Denise.
- Denise. That's a lovely name.

13:35.691 --> 13:37.442
Um...

13:38.235 --> 13:44.032
You know, in Italy they have wine
every day with lunch.

13:44.616 --> 13:47.285
And what do we do in this country?
We power our food down...

13:47.452 --> 13:50.706
...with caffeine, carbonation
and high-fructose corn syrup.

13:50.872 --> 13:55.585
No one ever takes the time
to enjoy things anymore.

13:58.588 --> 14:01.675
Denise, would you do me the honor...
