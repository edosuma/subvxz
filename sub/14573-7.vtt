WEBVTT

00:16.450 --> 00:17.718
(man)
Woo!

00:17.751 --> 00:19.687
(spectators booing)

00:22.523 --> 00:25.426
(spectators exclaiming)

00:26.427 --> 00:27.695
Woo!

00:27.728 --> 00:29.230
Woo!

00:37.971 --> 00:39.507
Well, Hurricane
Jasmine Forsythe

00:39.540 --> 00:41.509
has been wreaking havoc
in the South,

00:41.542 --> 00:44.678
packing winds of
1,600 miles per while

00:44.712 --> 00:46.247
and gust up to four.

00:46.280 --> 00:47.881
Damage from the storm
is so far

00:47.915 --> 00:49.417
estimated at
upwards of thrumple

00:49.450 --> 00:51.952
Dinuziti dollars
and 18 cents.

00:51.985 --> 00:53.221
Storm center experts
say there's

00:53.254 --> 00:55.089
a 70-10 percent chance

00:55.123 --> 00:58.259
Jasmine Forsythe will make
landfall in New York.

00:58.292 --> 01:00.027
Weather guy,
what can we expect

01:00.060 --> 01:02.062
from Jasmine Forsythe
now that Cuba's gone?

01:02.096 --> 01:04.098
Well, now, Cuba is not
technically gone.

01:04.132 --> 01:07.034
It's still there, but
it's under the ocean now.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.069
Now, as we focus
on Florida...

01:14.142 --> 01:15.476
(girl)
Check!

01:15.509 --> 01:16.877
(violin music)

01:16.910 --> 01:18.712
(speaking foreign language)

01:18.746 --> 01:21.749
**

01:40.168 --> 01:42.136
These are hot, careful.
Thank You.

01:54.515 --> 01:55.783
Hmm.

02:11.332 --> 02:13.767
(woman)
What your daughter Jane
is going through

02:13.801 --> 02:15.736
is rare but understandable.

02:17.171 --> 02:20.641
It sounds like
Jane has very

02:20.674 --> 02:22.943
high activity brain.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.545
The framework of school

02:24.578 --> 02:28.115
and activities that can
stimulate most children,

02:28.148 --> 02:31.452
she just finds constricting
and frustrating.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.886
Yeah, that sounds like--

02:32.920 --> 02:36.457
We know this about Jane,
but what can we do about it?

02:36.490 --> 02:39.493
Well, I'm sure
you know by now

02:39.527 --> 02:42.129
as parents that
there's not

02:42.162 --> 02:44.798
a solution to
every problem your

02:44.832 --> 02:46.300
kids are gonna have.

02:46.334 --> 02:49.169
Some struggles are good.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.473
Jane is going
through a lot,

02:52.506 --> 02:56.244
but how she copes
with it is going

02:56.277 --> 03:00.180
to define her strengths
down the road.

03:00.214 --> 03:01.482
See, that's what I think.
We're moving toward

03:01.515 --> 03:03.517
putting her in
a private school.

03:03.551 --> 03:04.918
Well, you're moving towards...

03:04.952 --> 03:07.154
What would you recommend?

03:07.187 --> 03:09.557
Well...

03:09.590 --> 03:11.492
Let me ask you.

03:11.525 --> 03:14.262
How did she cope
with your divorce?

03:16.730 --> 03:20.668
You know, I guess better
than Lilly did.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.403
Lilly had a harder time
and...

03:22.436 --> 03:25.373
I mean, now they're
both pretty well adjusted.

03:25.406 --> 03:26.440
No.

03:26.474 --> 03:28.542
I would say
the opposite is true.

03:28.576 --> 03:30.244
Lilly already had
some coping skills,

03:30.278 --> 03:31.845
but Jane was too young,

03:31.879 --> 03:33.046
and she's only
just now facing

03:33.080 --> 03:35.048
a lot of the issues
that Lilly had

03:35.082 --> 03:37.385
a chance to deal with.

03:37.418 --> 03:39.453
So-- So when you
were divorced,

03:39.487 --> 03:41.689
how young was
Jane at the time?

03:41.722 --> 03:42.723
She was three.

03:42.756 --> 03:45.192
Three, oh, that is very young.
Yeah.

03:45.225 --> 03:48.028
and Lilly was... six?

03:48.061 --> 03:49.563
So were they close?

03:54.935 --> 03:57.838
(screaming)

04:19.126 --> 04:20.461
Why aren't my kids together?
Yes.

04:20.494 --> 04:23.063
To ask questions, you know.
Yes, of course.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.965
I just explained it the best
way I could, but it's hard...

04:24.998 --> 04:26.600
Yes, it is, and it must
have been hard on you.

04:26.634 --> 04:28.168
...to explain it
to a three year old.

04:28.201 --> 04:30.404
It was. Yeah,
it was definitely hard on me.

04:30.438 --> 04:32.773
Very.
Yeah.

04:32.806 --> 04:34.608
Yeah.
So...

04:36.710 --> 04:39.513
How do you find balancing
your work schedule

04:39.547 --> 04:41.615
and your time with the kids?

04:41.649 --> 04:43.417
Well, I-- It works out
pretty well, because--

04:43.451 --> 04:46.286
See, my feeling is that
Jane and Lilly need to be moved

04:46.320 --> 04:47.655
to a better
learning environment,

04:47.688 --> 04:49.156
but I'm getting
a lot of resistance

04:49.189 --> 04:51.525
from their father.

04:51.559 --> 04:53.427
Their father,
Who's that?

04:53.461 --> 04:55.329
Where's he at?

04:55.363 --> 04:56.664
Oh, that's right,
he's here,

04:56.697 --> 04:58.366
He's right here
inside my face.

05:01.234 --> 05:02.770
That was hostile.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.705
What, what I said is--?
What about--

05:04.738 --> 05:06.006
You mean the look
on her face, right?

05:06.039 --> 05:07.608
No, please don't, Louie.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.142
Please don't do it here.
Don't what?

05:09.176 --> 05:11.812
Don't start here.
Don't what?

05:11.845 --> 05:13.013
We're here for Jane.

05:13.046 --> 05:15.649
I don't... want to
deal with that.

05:19.219 --> 05:20.821
I'm sorry, okay?
Mm-hmm.

05:20.854 --> 05:23.223
I'm kinda sorry.

05:23.256 --> 05:25.993
Look, what school
Jane goes to,

05:26.026 --> 05:28.061
Lilly goes to,
isn't going to

05:28.095 --> 05:30.030
make the critical difference.

05:30.063 --> 05:33.133
What is a deal breaker

05:33.166 --> 05:36.169
is their parents
getting along or not.

05:36.203 --> 05:38.806
Divorced or married,
the fact is,

05:38.839 --> 05:41.475
if there's harmony
between parents,

05:41.509 --> 05:43.377
the kids are happy,

05:43.411 --> 05:47.915
and if their isn't,
they are not.

05:50.518 --> 05:52.853
How have you two
been getting along?

05:54.688 --> 05:57.591
The thing is,
we were fine.

05:57.625 --> 05:59.493
For a while, like,
for years

05:59.527 --> 06:00.894
after we separated.

06:00.928 --> 06:02.329
Yeah, that's true.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.431
Uh-huh.

06:03.464 --> 06:06.099
And then things got worse?

06:06.133 --> 06:08.736
Yep.
Yeah, they did.

06:10.370 --> 06:13.240
That's hard.

06:13.273 --> 06:15.709
So, okay.

06:16.544 --> 06:18.045
Whose fault is it?

06:20.113 --> 06:21.515
That's right.

06:21.549 --> 06:23.283
That's what I'm asking.

06:23.316 --> 06:24.685
You guys were
getting along

06:24.718 --> 06:27.521
and now it's
just degenerating.

06:27.555 --> 06:29.089
Who do you think
is at fault?

06:35.729 --> 06:39.199
Well, that makes
it pretty clear.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.401
Then it's
your responsibility.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.371
Yes.

06:44.404 --> 06:47.374
I said it's
her responsibility.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.242
It's your fault.

06:49.276 --> 06:52.279
So it's your responsibility
to fix it,

06:52.312 --> 06:54.281
because you can't.

06:54.314 --> 06:57.918
Because your feelings
are not in control.

06:57.951 --> 07:01.421
You are very emotional
about your children.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.157
Janet, on the other hand,

07:04.191 --> 07:06.894
is very practical
and less guided

07:06.927 --> 07:08.529
by her feelings.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.638
Can we leave now while
this feels kinda even?

07:22.643 --> 07:25.646
What does she cost?

07:25.679 --> 07:27.481
$800 for the two hours.

07:27.515 --> 07:29.617
Oh, my God.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.919
Yeah, I mean,
for that kind of money,

07:31.952 --> 07:33.954
we could pay to
have Jane killed.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.660
(Janet laughing)

07:44.197 --> 07:45.432
Hey, listen.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.935
You know, we can--

07:47.968 --> 07:49.069
We can do this.

07:50.871 --> 07:52.339
You know, we just gotta--
Can we just--

07:52.372 --> 07:53.941
Let's get back on track.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.009
I mean, we're--

07:56.043 --> 07:57.177
We're a good team.

08:03.684 --> 08:05.519
I'm willing to try anything
you want to consider.

08:05.553 --> 08:08.055
I just-- Let's not do that
again, all right?

08:08.088 --> 08:10.457
Yes, I agree.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.226
I mean, we used to be
so smooth with this.

08:13.260 --> 08:14.461
I guess I just didn't figure

08:14.494 --> 08:15.629
that life after
divorce has its

08:15.663 --> 08:18.131
ups and downs like
a marriage has.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.000
Yeah, wow.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.334
It's like a whole
other relationship

08:21.368 --> 08:22.770
to manage, right.

08:24.204 --> 08:26.473
Whew.

08:26.506 --> 08:27.641
Anyway, I've been
going through

08:27.675 --> 08:29.209
my shit and that's--

08:29.242 --> 08:31.044
I know that's contributing
to the problem, so.

08:32.713 --> 08:36.850
Hey, what's with the new
girlfriend, by the way?

08:36.884 --> 08:38.418
Girlfriend?

08:38.451 --> 08:39.987
Amia?

08:40.020 --> 08:41.955
The girls never stop
talking about her.

08:44.257 --> 08:46.894
Oh, somebody's in love.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.662
Well...

08:48.696 --> 08:51.231
Louie, that's so great.

08:51.264 --> 08:52.499
Oh, my God.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.201
That makes me really happy.

08:57.204 --> 08:58.238
Oh...

08:58.271 --> 08:59.973
So tell me it's serious.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.510
Well, you know, I feel--

09:03.543 --> 09:04.745
I really like her.

09:04.778 --> 09:05.979
And...

09:07.414 --> 09:11.284
But she's leaving.

09:11.318 --> 09:12.620
She's leaving?

09:12.653 --> 09:14.855
Yeah, she's going
back to Hungary.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.523
She was only here
for a month and--

09:16.556 --> 09:18.525
Well, now, like,
ten days or so.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.894
Yeah, she's leaving,
back to Hungary.

09:20.928 --> 09:22.863
For how long?

09:22.896 --> 09:24.932
Ever, I mean,
for good.

09:24.965 --> 09:27.901
She's not-- you know,
that's where she lives.

09:27.935 --> 09:31.304
I just-- We've just
been hanging out.

09:31.338 --> 09:32.773
Wait, I don't understand.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.274
Okay, well, she's
my neighbor's niece.

09:34.307 --> 09:35.542
My neighbor is
this old lady

09:35.575 --> 09:38.378
from Hungary
and her niece...

09:38.411 --> 09:41.381
Amia came to help
her come back there,

09:41.414 --> 09:43.717
so she's got, like, a son

09:43.751 --> 09:45.052
and a career there.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.920
It's not--

09:46.954 --> 09:48.555
We just like each other
and we've been...

09:48.588 --> 09:50.457
spending time together
while she's here.

09:50.490 --> 09:52.793
Well, shit, marry her.
Make her stay.

09:52.826 --> 09:55.729
It's not really
an option.

09:55.763 --> 09:57.731
Why, what's so big about
her life back in Hungary?

09:57.765 --> 09:59.232
Well, I don't know
if you noticed,

09:59.266 --> 10:01.935
but the economy is shit
here right now and...

10:01.969 --> 10:04.137
And I don't really know,
entirely honestly,

10:04.171 --> 10:06.840
because we don't really
communicate.

10:06.874 --> 10:09.643
She doesn't speak
English at all.

10:09.677 --> 10:10.744
She doesn't speak English?
None.

10:10.778 --> 10:12.512
At all?
No.

10:12.545 --> 10:13.914
We just-- But we
communicate, we have,

10:13.947 --> 10:16.149
like, a rapport,
it's really nice.

10:16.183 --> 10:19.152
But she's leaving, so.

10:19.186 --> 10:20.520
This isn't right.

10:20.553 --> 10:21.789
What?

10:21.822 --> 10:23.156
You had this
woman hanging

10:23.190 --> 10:24.291
around with the kids

10:24.324 --> 10:25.592
and you're getting
close to her

10:25.625 --> 10:27.194
and they're
spending time with her

10:27.227 --> 10:28.461
and then she's leaving?

10:28.495 --> 10:30.998
Yeah.

10:31.031 --> 10:31.999
So?

10:32.032 --> 10:33.333
Well, how are
the girls gonna

10:33.366 --> 10:35.769
feel when the rug
is pulled out?

10:35.803 --> 10:37.370
They're gonna be sad.

10:37.404 --> 10:39.539
So am I.

10:39.572 --> 10:41.441
We're enjoying her company
while she's here

10:41.474 --> 10:43.210
and then we're all
gonna miss her.

10:44.544 --> 10:45.946
You know,
Janet, people--

10:45.979 --> 10:48.548
Sometimes you're
supposed to be sad.

10:48.581 --> 10:50.650
It's okay,
it's the flipside,

10:50.684 --> 10:51.985
and it's actually good.

10:52.019 --> 10:53.453
Yeah, you want
your kids to be sad?

10:53.486 --> 10:55.488
No.
Well, yes.

10:55.522 --> 10:57.224
If it's 'cause
they love somebody.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.293
Hey, you know,
you don't get to do this.

11:00.327 --> 11:01.695
This isn't--

11:01.729 --> 11:03.230
You don't get to--
I don't--

11:03.263 --> 11:04.732
You're with Patrick
and I don't run that down.

11:04.765 --> 11:06.166
I don't pick that apart.

11:06.199 --> 11:08.335
Okay, so you want to talk
about me and Patrick?

11:08.368 --> 11:09.703
Go ahead.
Okay, fine.

11:09.737 --> 11:12.005
Well, you guys
are pretty solid.

11:14.241 --> 11:15.475
And the girls love him.

11:15.508 --> 11:18.879
He seems like
a great guy and...

11:18.912 --> 11:21.348
your relationship
has brought a lot of

11:21.381 --> 11:22.883
stability to their lives

11:22.916 --> 11:25.385
that they lost
when we broke up,

11:25.418 --> 11:27.420
so, yeah.

11:27.454 --> 11:29.757
He smells like kale.
Okay, listen.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.658
I don't care who you
spend your time with.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.193
If you want to shack up
with some European chick--

11:33.226 --> 11:34.694
It's not like that.

11:34.728 --> 11:36.764
That's your business.
It's not like that.

11:38.866 --> 11:41.334
Oh, wait a minute.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.203
You're not even
(bleep) her?

11:45.873 --> 11:47.707
Are you kidding me?

11:47.741 --> 11:50.443
Oh, come on, Louie.

11:50.477 --> 11:52.679
Can't you just figure out
how to live a life already?

11:52.712 --> 11:55.682
Oh, my God.

11:55.715 --> 11:56.750
Oh, my God.

11:56.784 --> 11:58.886
I gotta go.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.757
(distant music blaring)

12:05.558 --> 12:08.862
* Me and no one else

12:08.896 --> 12:12.900
* Just give it all to me

12:16.403 --> 12:19.940
* Just give it all to me

12:23.076 --> 12:26.880
* One taste
just say hello *

12:26.914 --> 12:29.917
* I need to fill
my lovin' cup *

12:32.419 --> 12:36.089
(woman)
God damn it,
those people are loud.

12:39.192 --> 12:43.063
Louie, can you please call
the front desk and complain.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.564
I don't want to call
the front desk,

12:44.597 --> 12:46.466
why don't you
call the front desk?

12:46.499 --> 12:48.135
'Cause you're the man.

12:48.168 --> 12:51.671
That's stupid.

12:51.704 --> 12:53.073
You're just-- I don't
see why we couldn't have

12:53.106 --> 12:54.975
just stayed
at my mother's.

12:55.008 --> 12:56.776
'Cause I don't want to
sleep in your high school bed,

12:56.810 --> 12:58.645
and I don't want to wake up
to your dad hating me.

12:58.678 --> 12:59.847
Fine, then call
the front desk

12:59.880 --> 13:02.415
and complain, please.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.885
Jesus. Fine.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.825
Hi, they're being
crazy loud upstairs

13:11.859 --> 13:14.127
and playing music
and making noise.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.597
What? Okay.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.766
Thanks.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.269
So are they gonna
do something?

13:22.302 --> 13:23.470
No.

13:35.815 --> 13:39.486
(distant music playing)

13:50.563 --> 13:53.433
(inaudible speaking)

13:56.236 --> 13:58.171
What?

13:59.606 --> 14:00.740
I said this
is a nightmare.

14:00.773 --> 14:02.142
I'm sorry.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.510
We should have stayed
at your mother's.

14:03.543 --> 14:06.446
(distant bells ringing)

14:19.126 --> 14:20.260
What?

14:24.531 --> 14:27.700
I'm just...

14:27.734 --> 14:29.169
I'm...

14:29.202 --> 14:31.338
I am--

14:31.371 --> 14:34.607
Ahh.

14:34.641 --> 14:36.143
I'm just
kind of getting...

14:37.710 --> 14:40.513
... ready to say something.

14:40.547 --> 14:43.283
Okay.

14:43.316 --> 14:45.252
Okay.

14:47.420 --> 14:49.789
So remember that last
big fight that we had?

14:49.822 --> 14:51.058
When it got really bad

14:51.091 --> 14:54.894
and I said that
I wanted a divorce?

14:55.762 --> 14:58.231
Yeah?

14:58.265 --> 14:59.699
And remember
how we made up?

14:59.732 --> 15:02.869
Or, you know,
we didn't--

15:02.902 --> 15:05.805
We didn't actually make up.
We just--

15:05.838 --> 15:09.709
Just time went on
and eventually

15:09.742 --> 15:12.079
things went back to normal,

15:12.112 --> 15:13.913
and you know,
we never really

15:13.947 --> 15:16.416
addressed the fact that
I had said that.

15:16.449 --> 15:19.619
Yeah?
And it had happened before, too.

15:19.652 --> 15:21.654
You know,
you had said that,

15:21.688 --> 15:23.790
about divorce.

15:23.823 --> 15:26.559
Yeah.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.395
Oh...

15:28.428 --> 15:31.598
So what if,
right now,

15:32.865 --> 15:34.067
when it's calm, like--

15:34.101 --> 15:36.103
You know, when we're not--

15:36.136 --> 15:39.906
You know,
we're not fighting.

15:39.939 --> 15:43.943
What if we say that now?

15:43.977 --> 15:45.145
What if we say...

15:45.178 --> 15:46.413
I...

15:46.446 --> 15:49.149
Want a divorce?
Want a divorce.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.788
Wow.
I'm just saying--

15:55.822 --> 15:58.091
I'm just saying, like,
what if we just say it

15:58.125 --> 16:00.127
and just see how it sounds,

16:00.160 --> 16:04.097
you know, like,
without fighting.

16:04.131 --> 16:07.134
What if we do say it?

16:15.875 --> 16:18.678
I mean, Louie,
it's been hard for, like...

16:20.380 --> 16:21.581
... a year.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.217
Yeah, it has.

16:26.886 --> 16:28.388
And you know what?

16:31.158 --> 16:33.626
Look, we've been
married two years.

16:33.660 --> 16:34.727
We don't have any kids.

16:39.199 --> 16:41.000
We could get out now
and it'd be okay.

16:41.034 --> 16:42.535
Uh-huh.

16:46.439 --> 16:49.642
Instead of divorcing
out of anger.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.178
We could divorce
out of--

16:51.211 --> 16:52.312
Out of-- out of--
out of--

16:52.345 --> 16:54.114
You know,
out of kindness.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.232
(laughing)

17:16.136 --> 17:17.437
Who are you gonna date?

17:17.470 --> 17:19.839
I don't know.
Yes, you do, come on.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.675
Come on, tell me, who.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.444
Scarlet.

17:24.477 --> 17:25.678
Ew!

17:25.712 --> 17:27.347
What?
Louie!

17:27.380 --> 17:29.882
Oh, I am so glad
I'm divorcing you.

17:29.916 --> 17:31.351
She's a bag for me to...

17:31.384 --> 17:34.020
That's who you are?
... have sex with.

17:34.053 --> 17:37.857
Flesh bag.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.426
Well, what about you?

17:39.459 --> 17:41.361
Huh?
Nobody.

17:41.394 --> 17:42.595
Oh...

17:42.629 --> 17:44.063
Uh-uh, seriously, nobody.

17:44.097 --> 17:46.065
Uh-uh, you were
my last man.

17:46.099 --> 17:48.568
All right, yeah.
Or woman.

17:52.505 --> 17:55.375
Can I just--

17:55.408 --> 17:59.112
Do you want to have
sex one last time?

17:59.146 --> 18:02.215
Like, not even take
our clothes off?

18:02.249 --> 18:04.884
You mean, like,
you want to make love?

18:04.917 --> 18:07.320
No, I mean, like,

18:07.354 --> 18:09.822
we're walking out
of the theater,

18:09.856 --> 18:11.391
at the door,

18:11.424 --> 18:14.060
look back,
light switch at hand,

18:14.093 --> 18:16.129
memories.

18:16.163 --> 18:18.064
And then we,
like, walk out,

18:18.097 --> 18:20.300
like when they let...

18:20.333 --> 18:22.602
the autistic kid,
like, get a touchdown.

18:22.635 --> 18:23.770
Mkay.

18:23.803 --> 18:25.004
Like, just one last time.
Okay.

18:25.037 --> 18:27.307
Just for the record.
Okay.

18:27.340 --> 18:29.509
Yeah?
Yeah, come on.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.449
Uh.

18:42.222 --> 18:43.423
All right, you ready?
Oh, yeah.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.625
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

18:45.658 --> 18:48.628
Ready?
Last time.

18:48.661 --> 18:50.297
Here we go.

18:50.330 --> 18:54.201
Ha, ha,
ha, ha, ha!

18:54.234 --> 18:56.336
What's the matter?

18:56.369 --> 18:58.805
You okay?
Nothing!

18:58.838 --> 19:00.507
I'm coming!

19:00.540 --> 19:01.774
Really?

19:01.808 --> 19:03.810
Yes!
Oh!

19:03.843 --> 19:05.845
Oh, my God!

19:05.878 --> 19:07.113
I am, too!

19:07.146 --> 19:09.316
Oh!
Oh!

19:09.349 --> 19:10.617
Oh!

19:10.650 --> 19:11.818
Oh!

19:11.851 --> 19:13.320
Oh!

19:15.555 --> 19:17.957
(laughing)

19:17.990 --> 19:19.726
Oh.

19:19.759 --> 19:21.160
Oh.

19:24.897 --> 19:26.032
Oh.

19:26.065 --> 19:27.534
We did it.

19:27.567 --> 19:30.737
(woman)
That was the best
sex we've ever had.

19:30.770 --> 19:31.904
Yeah, it was because...

19:31.938 --> 19:34.641
we knew it was
the last time.

19:34.674 --> 19:35.842
Good job.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.677
You too.

19:40.913 --> 19:42.315
I mean, are we--

19:42.349 --> 19:44.684
Are we being crazy
or are we geniuses?

19:44.717 --> 19:47.720
'Cause we can do
whatever we want now.

19:47.754 --> 19:49.989
You could go to Africa.

19:50.022 --> 19:53.393
And you can go
be a comedian.

19:53.426 --> 19:56.296
You hate my comedy,
don't you?

19:58.965 --> 20:00.367
Louie.

20:02.101 --> 20:05.272
You are funny
to some people,

20:05.305 --> 20:06.773
just not me.

20:11.444 --> 20:13.546
Oh, my God, I cannot believe
that I just said that.

20:13.580 --> 20:15.915
No, no, it's-- no,
it's totally fine.

20:15.948 --> 20:19.051
I mean, I like, knew.

20:19.085 --> 20:20.520
It's-- What a relief.

20:20.553 --> 20:21.954
Thank you.

20:21.988 --> 20:24.524
Finally, God.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.726
You say it.

20:30.096 --> 20:31.898
(laughing)

20:31.931 --> 20:34.767
What?

20:34.801 --> 20:36.869
What if...

20:36.903 --> 20:38.805
just now...

20:38.838 --> 20:39.939
you got pregnant?

20:39.972 --> 20:41.574
Oh!

20:43.743 --> 20:45.445
(both laughing)

21:02.362 --> 21:03.563
I saw this woman one time,
she was an old lady,

21:03.596 --> 21:04.731
and she was wearing
leg braces,

21:04.764 --> 21:07.066
and she had things,
cane things,

21:07.099 --> 21:08.167
and she's walking.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.836
She's struggling up a hill

21:09.869 --> 21:12.405
with the leg braces
and the crutches.

21:12.439 --> 21:13.773
And then there
is a lady behind her,

21:13.806 --> 21:17.143
who's very beautiful
and very tall and young,

21:17.176 --> 21:18.445
and she had high heels,

21:18.478 --> 21:20.680
and she was struggling
the same amount

21:20.713 --> 21:24.584
to get up the hill,
which is weird.

21:24.617 --> 21:25.818
But when I saw this old lady,

21:25.852 --> 21:27.587
she looked so sick
and uncomfortable

21:27.620 --> 21:30.022
and I thought to myself,
"Jeez, I wish she felt better.

21:30.056 --> 21:31.290
I wish she felt better."

21:31.324 --> 21:32.592
And then I thought
another thought

21:32.625 --> 21:33.926
that was, like,
challenging myself,

21:33.960 --> 21:35.928
and I thought, "Really?
How much do you wish it?

21:35.962 --> 21:38.598
"How much do you wish
that lady felt better?

21:38.631 --> 21:40.299
"What would you
be willing to do

21:40.333 --> 21:42.769
or give up so that
that lady could feel better?"

21:42.802 --> 21:45.605
Like, if somebody told me that
that lady would feel better

21:45.638 --> 21:48.675
if I didn't drink lemonade
for two years...

21:50.176 --> 21:51.444
I'd be like,
"I don't know that bitch."

21:51.478 --> 21:52.612
I don't wanna-- I don't--

21:52.645 --> 21:55.648
I mean, I'm not obsessed
with lemonade.

21:57.584 --> 21:59.552
But I might want
some lemonade.

22:02.389 --> 22:03.956
Next June, I might--

22:03.990 --> 22:05.124
Somebody-- "Here."

22:05.157 --> 22:07.727
"Ah, that lady, shit."

22:09.829 --> 22:10.863
**

22:12.365 --> 22:13.933
(record scratching)

22:18.337 --> 22:21.040
