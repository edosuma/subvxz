WEBVTT

02:36.866 --> 02:41.634
We were born here, we were raised here,
and we are going to die here.

02:44.073 --> 02:47.141
Did you ever hear that a bird in
the hand's worth ten in the bush?

02:47.143 --> 02:49.910
Might be a bird for you,
but it's a handful of shit for us.

02:49.912 --> 02:51.744
- Yeah!
- Excuse me?

02:53.415 --> 02:54.747
You almost missed all the fun.

02:54.749 --> 02:57.051
Vulgarity is
absolutely uncalled for.

02:57.053 --> 02:59.519
We get the shaft while
y'all stay rich.

02:59.521 --> 03:01.521
- Gentlemen.
- That's what I'm talking about.

03:01.523 --> 03:02.892
Knock it off.

03:04.593 --> 03:07.995
Mr. Sam, they offered you 25,000

03:07.997 --> 03:09.596
for your daddy's house, right?

03:09.598 --> 03:11.698
- Mm-hmm.
- 25,000.

03:11.700 --> 03:13.600
Mr. Jimmy, how much did
Southcrest offer you

03:13.602 --> 03:15.768
for that pasture
where you keep your horses?

03:15.770 --> 03:18.538
- We're not going there.
- Yeah, let's go there.

03:18.540 --> 03:19.806
I'll figure out how
much they offered.

03:19.808 --> 03:21.075
Y'all keep y'all fancy houses,

03:21.077 --> 03:23.043
and we get put out
on the street!

03:23.045 --> 03:24.979
We don't all have the luxury

03:24.981 --> 03:27.447
of selling off our
family's sugar cane.

03:27.449 --> 03:31.517
For you all it's just land, but for
the rest of us, these are our homes.

03:31.519 --> 03:33.921
Yeah, right!

03:33.923 --> 03:35.390
That's all we saying.

03:38.560 --> 03:40.662
Thank you, Counselor.

03:42.764 --> 03:45.865
Didn't realize we were
all being cross examined.

03:47.802 --> 03:50.870
I tell you,
I just hate to see

03:50.872 --> 03:53.575
neighbor turned
against neighbor.

03:55.244 --> 03:59.079
Look, when Southcrest
first approached me

03:59.081 --> 04:02.749
about selling what's left
of our family's land,

04:02.751 --> 04:04.153
I was skeptical.

04:05.487 --> 04:07.187
But they convinced me.

04:07.189 --> 04:10.657
And they've asked me to
help convince you all too.

04:10.659 --> 04:13.893
Change is hard,
I won't deny that.

04:13.895 --> 04:17.529
Once that meant making
way for the oil and gas,

04:17.531 --> 04:20.166
and now, if Pont Minou
is going to survive,

04:20.168 --> 04:23.636
we're going to have
to adapt, again.

04:23.638 --> 04:26.739
With all due respect, Miss Mary,
but what do you know about change?

04:26.741 --> 04:28.843
Hey. Let her talk now.

04:30.246 --> 04:33.746
The Southcrest Rail Depot
will bring with it

04:33.748 --> 04:36.250
good paying jobs.

04:36.252 --> 04:39.619
The property taxes alone
will be enough to revitalize

04:39.621 --> 04:43.790
our schools, and parks,
maybe even this old church.

04:45.927 --> 04:49.896
If any of you feel that
the offers on your properties

04:49.898 --> 04:54.170
aren't enough,
my door is always open.

04:55.704 --> 04:59.706
The very least we owe
you all is a fresh start.

05:01.177 --> 05:03.012
Maybe. We'll see.

05:16.058 --> 05:18.058
We'll see you for
dinner, won't we, sheriff?

05:18.060 --> 05:19.661
Wouldn't miss it.

05:22.131 --> 05:24.597
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:24.599 --> 05:26.300
- That went well.
- Hmm.

05:26.302 --> 05:28.835
Miss Mary wasn't too shy about
throwing money around, huh?

05:28.837 --> 05:30.737
Yeah, she's worried.

05:30.739 --> 05:33.639
And there is a lot more people
on the fence than I thought.

05:33.641 --> 05:37.810
Yeah, Jimmy's set in his ways,
but I could talk to a few of the others.

05:37.812 --> 05:40.915
Yeah? That would actually go
a long way coming from you.

05:42.284 --> 05:43.983
How about we grab a drink?

05:43.985 --> 05:47.187
I give you a few
names to work on?

05:47.189 --> 05:48.723
Sure.

05:49.691 --> 05:50.992
- Yeah?
- Okay.

05:51.926 --> 05:53.195
Come on, we're going to be late.

07:24.353 --> 07:27.055
If you don't mind me asking,
how much did Miss Mary offer you?

07:28.056 --> 07:29.822
25,000.

07:29.824 --> 07:31.826
And could you not talk
to me while you're pissing.

07:34.829 --> 07:36.030
You going to take it?

07:37.899 --> 07:39.832
I don't know.
There's a place in New Orleans

07:39.834 --> 07:42.001
I can maybe put
a down payment on.

07:42.003 --> 07:44.036
Living in the city
instead of this backwater.

07:44.038 --> 07:46.240
Yeah.

07:46.242 --> 07:47.942
But it's not just up to me.

07:50.479 --> 07:51.946
Sissy going with you?

07:54.283 --> 07:56.350
What you going to do?

07:56.352 --> 07:58.117
It'd be nice to get
Mama into a home.

07:58.119 --> 07:59.355
Take care of her right.

08:00.489 --> 08:01.988
Finally settle down myself.

08:45.934 --> 08:48.937
- Morning, Deputy.
- License and registration.

08:52.106 --> 08:53.442
What are you looking at him for?

08:55.176 --> 08:56.044
Sorry.

08:57.045 --> 08:59.346
- Wow.
- Sorry.

08:59.348 --> 09:02.216
It's a little early
in the day, isn't it, JW?

09:02.218 --> 09:05.017
- It was a long night.
- Mm-hmm.

09:05.019 --> 09:06.786
- Who's this?
- That's Ken.

09:06.788 --> 09:08.355
- Ken what?
- Look, I'll just show you I'm good...

09:08.357 --> 09:10.858
Hey, hey, hey. Ain't nobody
tell you to do all that.

09:12.461 --> 09:13.795
Show me your papers.

09:16.332 --> 09:17.333
All right.

09:18.300 --> 09:19.335
All right.

09:21.903 --> 09:23.972
Hey, she's got
a personality on her, huh?

09:29.978 --> 09:31.447
I think we should make him blow.

09:34.416 --> 09:35.317
Hey.

09:36.585 --> 09:38.452
Hey.

09:38.454 --> 09:40.820
You know we're going to catch
all kind of shit for this.

09:40.822 --> 09:43.889
Why? 'Cause his mama
and the sheriff are tight?

09:43.891 --> 09:46.426
It's because of his mama that
the sheriff is the sheriff.

09:46.428 --> 09:48.362
So he gets to drive around
town all tow up and shit?

09:48.364 --> 09:49.962
Look, I don't like it
either, okay, but...

09:49.964 --> 09:51.331
Okay, but that's
just the way it is.

09:51.333 --> 09:52.501
- It is.
- Mm.

09:58.607 --> 10:00.342
- You in good enough shape to drive?
- Yeah.

10:35.109 --> 10:37.043
Hopefully
it's a quiet one.

10:37.045 --> 10:38.878
Yeah, last night
I had a bunch of kids

10:38.880 --> 10:40.349
try to get into
the bar with fake IDs.

10:46.054 --> 10:47.556
About earlier, um...

10:50.559 --> 10:52.494
These extra shifts
aren't wearing you out?

10:55.564 --> 10:57.997
Yeah, the nurses ain't cheap.

10:57.999 --> 11:00.066
I had to sell my truck too.

11:00.068 --> 11:01.537
Tell Billie to put
you behind the bar.

11:02.937 --> 11:05.574
Look, at least working the door
I can catch a little sleep.

11:08.076 --> 11:09.208
I'll see you tomorrow.

11:09.210 --> 11:11.345
All right, take care.

11:11.347 --> 11:12.481
Thanks for the ride to work.

11:21.255 --> 11:23.322
Price on that place
in the Bywater went down again.

11:23.324 --> 11:24.957
Hmm?

11:24.959 --> 11:26.360
Probably
going to sell soon.

11:26.362 --> 11:28.194
Oh.

11:28.196 --> 11:30.464
I was thinking maybe
we could take a look?

11:30.466 --> 11:33.032
Yeah, there's just too much
going on right now. I wish I could.

11:33.034 --> 11:34.603
Not even to take a look?

11:36.337 --> 11:37.473
What's the rush?

11:41.443 --> 11:43.244
I can finally afford
the down payment.

11:44.413 --> 11:46.147
If you sell the house.

11:47.348 --> 11:48.950
Seems like a lot of
people want out.

11:52.421 --> 11:53.622
What do you want?

11:57.091 --> 11:58.627
I want us to finally
be together.

12:02.631 --> 12:03.599
I do too.

12:05.133 --> 12:06.666
I mean, you know
what's going to happen

12:06.668 --> 12:08.635
to everybody here
if I drop this case.

12:08.637 --> 12:11.538
You think they would stick up
for you if they knew about us?

12:11.540 --> 12:13.609
You're their lawyer,
not their savior.

12:14.710 --> 12:17.044
Doesn't mean they deserve
to be put out on the street.

12:23.117 --> 12:24.218
I'm just...

12:25.521 --> 12:27.052
I'm just tired.

12:27.054 --> 12:29.054
I just need some more time.

12:29.056 --> 12:30.490
They're going to realize
this place is more trouble

12:30.492 --> 12:32.226
than it's worth,
and then we'll go.

12:35.764 --> 12:37.129
Okay.

13:12.333 --> 13:15.334
The property we really
need is John Landry's.

13:15.336 --> 13:17.303
That won't be a problem.

13:18.372 --> 13:19.606
Busier than the damn

13:19.608 --> 13:22.076
Roosevelt Hotel in here today.

13:27.583 --> 13:29.183
Something wrong, Deputy?

13:30.719 --> 13:33.755
Did you mean what you said about
getting us more money for our property?

13:36.290 --> 13:37.659
Could we continue this later?

13:39.060 --> 13:40.794
Laura, would you
please see him out?

13:40.796 --> 13:42.631
He knows where the door's at.

13:48.169 --> 13:49.671
- Tea?
- I'm good.

13:51.507 --> 13:53.372
That everybody who's selling?

13:56.210 --> 13:57.478
What can I do for you?

13:59.748 --> 14:02.214
There's a house in New Orleans,

14:02.216 --> 14:04.786
but the down payment's
more than you're offering.

14:07.388 --> 14:08.555
Where in town?

14:08.557 --> 14:09.791
The Bywater.

14:11.359 --> 14:12.594
How much are we talking?

14:15.831 --> 14:17.198
25,000.

14:18.767 --> 14:21.402
Well, that's double
the original valuation.

14:23.371 --> 14:26.708
Are there others who might be
persuaded by a similar offer?

14:28.476 --> 14:30.877
A lot of us just
need a new start.

14:33.414 --> 14:35.584
Has your sister gotten
the help she needs?

14:38.286 --> 14:39.420
We don't really talk.

14:41.890 --> 14:44.658
I can't make any promises,

14:44.660 --> 14:48.396
but I certainly will speak to
them and see what I can do.

15:00.341 --> 15:01.675
Careful, tiger.

15:01.677 --> 15:03.810
You're still working
the door tonight.

15:03.812 --> 15:04.780
I'm good.

15:07.816 --> 15:11.185
Oh, I see she finally said yes.

15:11.887 --> 15:13.920
It's just drinks, but.

15:13.922 --> 15:15.487
Mm-hmm.

15:15.489 --> 15:17.258
You sound like
my first ex-husband.

15:21.495 --> 15:23.429
So, I was thinking we could
start with the Roberts.

15:23.431 --> 15:25.232
My mom knew them pretty well.

15:26.902 --> 15:28.770
Do you think we could
convince them not to sell?

15:29.671 --> 15:31.203
Can I ask you something first?

15:31.205 --> 15:32.206
Mm-hmm.

15:33.675 --> 15:35.176
How come you finally said yes?

15:37.411 --> 15:38.812
To?

15:38.814 --> 15:40.546
To having a drink with me.

15:40.548 --> 15:42.448
Oh.

15:42.450 --> 15:44.283
I've been thinking
that maybe you and I could

15:44.285 --> 15:45.687
see each other a little more.

15:47.221 --> 15:48.122
Oh.

15:52.593 --> 15:56.195
John, I, I appreciate
your help on this so much,

15:56.197 --> 15:57.764
and I think you're a great guy,

15:57.766 --> 16:00.332
- but, but I'm not...
- I'm not in a hurry.

16:00.334 --> 16:03.639
No, no, that's,
that's not what I meant, um...

16:08.710 --> 16:10.511
I'm not interested in men.

16:14.348 --> 16:16.450
Are you sure you just haven't
met the right guy yet?

16:17.618 --> 16:19.320
Yeah, I'm sure.

16:25.626 --> 16:28.560
Can we still work together?

16:28.562 --> 16:30.797
You know, I could really
use your help on this.

16:30.799 --> 16:33.399
A few more families
with property

16:33.401 --> 16:35.634
would tip this thing
in the other direction.

16:35.636 --> 16:39.471
Yeah, yeah, of course.

16:39.473 --> 16:42.341
Okay, good.

16:42.343 --> 16:45.277
- The Roberts.
- Yeah, the Roberts and the Poches have been here

16:45.279 --> 16:46.780
- for four generations...
- Mm-hmm.

16:46.782 --> 16:49.015
...and they hate Jimmy Falgot.

16:49.017 --> 16:51.417
- Why?
- Because he's an asshole.

16:51.419 --> 16:53.385
Right.

16:53.387 --> 16:55.289
Yeah, didn't notice.

16:56.457 --> 16:57.926
Um...

17:05.834 --> 17:07.566
John thinks
he can convince the Roberts

17:07.568 --> 17:09.601
and the Poches not to sell.

17:09.603 --> 17:11.369
This could be
exactly what we need

17:11.372 --> 17:12.840
to stop Mary's
deal with Southcrest.

17:13.775 --> 17:15.875
We should celebrate
this weekend.

17:15.877 --> 17:16.778
Hmm?

17:18.646 --> 17:21.480
Sam's playing at The Moon.
You want to go?

17:21.482 --> 17:22.915
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

17:22.917 --> 17:24.251
Yeah, sure.

17:28.990 --> 17:29.891
You okay?

17:30.926 --> 17:33.561
Yeah.

17:35.329 --> 17:36.998
- You expecting someone?
- No.

17:38.834 --> 17:40.267
I'll get it.

17:46.942 --> 17:48.074
Who is it?

17:48.076 --> 17:49.376
JW.

17:50.979 --> 17:53.612
- I don't have anything to say to you.
- I know what you've been

17:53.614 --> 17:55.314
doing and you need to stop.

17:55.316 --> 17:57.851
- Now.
- You need to go.

17:57.853 --> 18:01.855
You need to stay out of my shit
or I'm going to fuck you up!

18:01.857 --> 18:03.257
Do you hear me?

18:10.031 --> 18:11.798
What
the hell was that?

18:11.800 --> 18:13.867
It's fine.

18:13.869 --> 18:16.368
- It's just work.
- Work? It didn't sound like work.

18:16.370 --> 18:18.504
It's just work. It's fine.

18:18.506 --> 18:20.274
It's fine, it's fine, just...

18:22.878 --> 18:23.845
You okay?

18:24.712 --> 18:27.015
- You all right?
- Yeah, mm-hmm, yeah.

18:33.354 --> 18:34.888
Look, I got you, okay?

18:34.890 --> 18:35.924
Yeah.

18:53.108 --> 18:54.508
Oh, God.

18:55.509 --> 18:56.544
Oh, yeah.

19:19.935 --> 19:21.036
Oh, yeah.

19:30.611 --> 19:31.743
Honey, come here.

19:31.745 --> 19:33.745
Oh, come here.

19:33.747 --> 19:34.983
Come here.

19:56.704 --> 19:57.703
Of course.

20:01.809 --> 20:03.442
- Baby?
- What?

20:03.444 --> 20:04.878
Why?

20:04.880 --> 20:06.545
Why the hell do you
keep these in here?

20:06.547 --> 20:08.614
Mama gave it to me,
and she said it was

20:08.616 --> 20:11.985
blessed by the Pope, and so I kept it.

20:11.987 --> 20:14.153
Oh, wow, his little
hand is busted.

20:14.155 --> 20:16.222
- He's not doing too good.
- Oh.

20:16.224 --> 20:17.658
Where? Let me see.

20:18.626 --> 20:21.027
Ah.

20:21.029 --> 20:22.898
Come here.

20:28.569 --> 20:30.502
- Hey, baby.
- Yeah?

20:30.504 --> 20:32.040
I got to tell you something.

20:32.974 --> 20:35.043
They offered me another 25,000.

20:38.545 --> 20:40.949
What do you, what do you
mean they offered you?

20:42.183 --> 20:43.985
Who? Mary?

20:47.022 --> 20:48.622
Did you go to see her?

20:50.258 --> 20:51.792
What is wrong with you?

20:53.929 --> 20:56.930
I mean, she's got money,
and lawyers, and...

20:56.932 --> 20:58.630
And, and you think
it's a lost cause,

20:58.632 --> 21:00.035
so you're just
going to cash out?

21:04.940 --> 21:06.607
I mean, baby, I love you.

21:08.575 --> 21:10.111
But there's some fights
you just can't win.

21:14.049 --> 21:17.152
You didn't even give me
the chance to try.

21:23.191 --> 21:25.058
Wow.

21:25.060 --> 21:26.161
No.

21:30.831 --> 21:31.865
Get out.

22:55.983 --> 22:58.217
Wow, you look like shit.

22:58.219 --> 23:00.155
- I closed down the bar last night.
- I see that.

23:01.122 --> 23:02.589
I don't want to leave.

23:03.891 --> 23:05.258
Hey, Miss Doris.

23:09.930 --> 23:11.266
What are you doing here?

23:12.200 --> 23:14.400
Chuck knows that
we're not supposed

23:14.402 --> 23:16.635
to have the help
on the weekends.

23:16.637 --> 23:18.003
That's our time.

23:27.382 --> 23:29.317
Bernadette.

23:32.320 --> 23:35.254
John was out with that
Leslie last night.

23:35.256 --> 23:37.656
Hmm, that right?

23:37.658 --> 23:41.726
And I told him,
I want at least one grandbaby

23:41.728 --> 23:43.429
before they put me
in the ground.

23:47.135 --> 23:52.105
You're not going nowhere.

23:52.107 --> 23:53.705
Oh, what are you waiting for?

23:53.707 --> 23:55.742
That kitchen's not
going to clean itself.

23:56.877 --> 23:58.045
Mama...

23:59.079 --> 24:00.946
I got to go to
work for a little bit.

24:00.948 --> 24:03.416
Nurse Rhonda's going to come by,
she's going to take care of you.

24:03.418 --> 24:04.651
I promise, here, just.

24:05.386 --> 24:07.821
Mama, not so many of these.

24:17.432 --> 24:19.798
Insurance won't cover a home?

24:19.800 --> 24:21.902
Hell, I can't even
afford the damn nurse.

24:26.274 --> 24:27.408
I love you, Mama.

24:54.335 --> 24:56.335
<i>Calling all units.
Calling all units.</i>

24:56.337 --> 24:59.438
<i>We've got a 10-54 on the access
road at Oleander drive.</i>

25:18.259 --> 25:19.394
You called in?

25:31.805 --> 25:33.707
Do me a favor.
Sit in your truck, please.

27:38.999 --> 27:41.367
I was just with her
at Billie's last night.

27:41.369 --> 27:44.204
She, uh, wanted help
with Falgot and them.

27:46.674 --> 27:48.476
Did you see anything
out of the ordinary?

27:49.577 --> 27:51.076
No, the usual.

27:51.078 --> 27:52.678
Billie at the bar,
Peltier brothers,

27:52.680 --> 27:56.948
and there were a few
suits from out of town.

27:56.950 --> 27:58.484
Did any of them talk to her?

27:58.486 --> 28:00.187
- No.
- When was this?

28:02.557 --> 28:04.623
Must have been around eight.

28:04.625 --> 28:06.592
I started working the door
an hour after she left.

28:06.594 --> 28:07.595
Sheriff.

28:09.162 --> 28:10.297
Give me a minute.

28:11.599 --> 28:13.900
Morning, Mrs. Waguespack.

28:15.001 --> 28:16.569
- Is this their land?
- What's happened?

28:16.571 --> 28:19.204
- A body was found.
- JW's, I think.

28:19.206 --> 28:22.541
Almost everything between the tracks
and the river is owned by one of them.

28:22.543 --> 28:24.510
He was at Leslie's
house last night.

28:24.512 --> 28:26.246
- What?
- Yeah, he cussed her out.

28:27.648 --> 28:29.049
How do you know?

28:30.418 --> 28:32.016
She called me.

28:32.018 --> 28:33.318
Who could do
something like this?

28:33.320 --> 28:35.286
She say what it was about?

28:35.288 --> 28:36.689
We don't know yet.

28:36.691 --> 28:38.459
But those two will
have more information.

28:44.699 --> 28:48.401
Deputies Landry and Leblanc
were the first on the scene.

28:48.403 --> 28:50.736
Bless your heart, Bernadette.

28:50.738 --> 28:52.339
I know y'all were friends.

28:53.240 --> 28:54.973
Thank you.

28:54.975 --> 28:56.444
Is there anything
you can tell us?

29:00.415 --> 29:04.750
- No.
- Y'all rent this land to some of the hunting clubs, don't you?

29:04.752 --> 29:07.218
- Yeah, that's right.
- Well, whoever did this

29:07.220 --> 29:10.321
didn't take her in very far. Either
he knew she was going to be found

29:10.323 --> 29:12.292
or he was in too much
of a hurry to care.

29:13.428 --> 29:15.494
I'll keep you all posted in
case there's any arrangements

29:15.496 --> 29:17.563
that needs to be done
before this goes public.

29:17.565 --> 29:21.001
- Thank you, Shane.
- We're going to need an official statement.

29:23.504 --> 29:24.705
I'll handle that.

29:26.072 --> 29:27.974
Just some formalities,
Mrs. Waguespack.

31:26.661 --> 31:28.526
Did you find something?

31:28.528 --> 31:31.231
Check out what half
of Waguespack is worth.

31:36.837 --> 31:40.440
JW's wife hired Leslie
to handle their divorce.

31:41.408 --> 31:42.610
1.5 million.

31:43.911 --> 31:45.510
You might call that a motive.

32:36.329 --> 32:38.833
- What can you tell us, Doc?
- Not much yet.

32:45.472 --> 32:49.742
Still waiting on toxicology, but based on
the amount of damage done to her windpipe,

32:49.744 --> 32:52.477
the cause of death was
definitely strangulation.

32:52.479 --> 32:56.316
I put the time of death sometime
between ten and midnight.

32:57.217 --> 32:59.550
Bruising about the neck
is what you would expect,

32:59.552 --> 33:01.754
but these ligature marks,

33:01.756 --> 33:03.621
they're unusual.

33:03.623 --> 33:04.923
What are they?

33:04.925 --> 33:06.659
Mm. A necklace maybe.

33:06.661 --> 33:07.993
Knots on a rope.

33:07.995 --> 33:10.296
Whatever it is,
it's your murder weapon.

33:11.398 --> 33:13.598
Any sign of sexual trauma?

33:13.600 --> 33:16.234
No semen, but she'd
been sexually active

33:16.236 --> 33:17.872
in the last 48 hours.

33:19.707 --> 33:21.207
Was she seeing someone
that you know of?

33:25.578 --> 33:27.913
- I thought she was a dyke.
- What the hell's that got to do with anything?

33:27.915 --> 33:30.316
Okay, why don't we just
stick to what you know.

33:32.019 --> 33:34.485
- What's that?
- More bruising.

33:34.487 --> 33:36.289
She put up one hell of a fight.

33:38.591 --> 33:40.425
Anything else?

33:40.427 --> 33:42.830
I'll know more after
the rape kit comes back.

34:48.495 --> 34:50.396
What the hell are you doing?

34:52.699 --> 34:54.300
I heard what happened.

34:55.668 --> 34:56.771
I'm, I'm sorry.

35:00.875 --> 35:01.842
Thanks.

35:04.011 --> 35:04.945
B?

35:06.579 --> 35:07.647
B!

35:17.423 --> 35:18.725
I got
work tomorrow.

35:19.726 --> 35:21.028
You could take the day off.

35:22.362 --> 35:23.831
And tell them what?

35:27.067 --> 35:29.170
That she was your...

35:33.040 --> 35:34.307
she was...

35:35.475 --> 35:36.844
What you coming down from?

35:45.418 --> 35:47.720
You need to go.

35:53.693 --> 35:55.595
I can't do this again.

35:58.165 --> 35:59.399
Just go!

36:02.169 --> 36:03.070
Fine.

37:41.734 --> 37:42.970
What the hell are we doing here?

37:44.138 --> 37:46.439
Well, someone's got
to talk to JW.

37:47.573 --> 37:49.074
Okay, I know you're upset,

37:49.076 --> 37:51.009
but you can't just go in
and brace the Waguespacks.

37:51.011 --> 37:53.147
<i>Unit 225, dispatch.</i>

37:54.181 --> 37:55.948
Unit 225, go ahead.

37:55.950 --> 37:57.915
<i>we've got, uh,
an African-American female,</i>

37:57.917 --> 38:00.087
<i>possible overdose,
at South of Robertson.</i>

38:03.556 --> 38:06.091
Copy that, dispatch,
225 is en route.

38:06.093 --> 38:07.692
Let's go.

38:19.139 --> 38:21.073
- Did you find her like this?
- Okay, hold on, I got her.

38:21.075 --> 38:23.077
Hey, wake up. Come on. Come on.

38:24.211 --> 38:25.778
Get the Narcan.

38:50.636 --> 38:52.104
I can stay if you need.

38:52.106 --> 38:53.040
I'll be all right.

38:57.111 --> 38:58.745
What do you want me
to tell the Sheriff?

39:00.080 --> 39:01.681
Tell him it's family.

39:06.619 --> 39:08.188
I'll let you know
if we find anything.

40:13.287 --> 40:16.022
Okay, okay, okay.

40:17.391 --> 40:19.193
Okay, okay, okay.

41:16.082 --> 41:16.983
Hey.

41:18.185 --> 41:19.917
Doing okay?

41:19.919 --> 41:21.053
You know.

41:23.890 --> 41:25.323
Just make sure you're ready.

42:31.458 --> 42:33.726
So, I got to ask or you
going to come out with it?

42:39.566 --> 42:42.101
Shane gave Leslie's
case to State CID.

42:43.403 --> 42:44.304
What?

42:45.439 --> 42:47.805
They got some guy that's
strangling women in Baton Rouge,

42:47.807 --> 42:49.274
and they think it
might be connected.

42:49.276 --> 42:50.344
Might be?

42:52.979 --> 42:53.946
What about JW?

42:57.116 --> 43:00.117
Are you telling me
no one's even talked to him?

43:03.257 --> 43:04.291
What do you want me to do?

43:07.327 --> 43:09.929
I want someone other
than me to give a shit.

43:18.272 --> 43:19.306
All right.

43:25.111 --> 43:26.979
They ever
find Leslie's phone?

43:28.415 --> 43:30.080
No.

43:30.082 --> 43:32.352
The best guess is
the suspect took it with him.

43:47.033 --> 43:49.403
Excuse me, Mrs. Waguespack.

43:51.003 --> 43:54.306
There's only one Mrs. Waguespack
and it ain't me.

43:56.376 --> 43:57.577
Help y'all?

43:59.579 --> 44:01.814
We just have a few
questions for you.

44:03.583 --> 44:05.149
Baby.

44:05.151 --> 44:07.552
Heard Sissy's back with you.

44:07.554 --> 44:09.288
We really miss her around here.

44:10.457 --> 44:12.224
How well did y'all know Leslie?

44:14.293 --> 44:16.193
About as well as
you know anyone.

44:16.195 --> 44:17.995
Why?

44:17.997 --> 44:21.033
You have any business with
her outside of Southcrest?

44:22.536 --> 44:24.336
No.

44:24.338 --> 44:25.871
How about you?

44:27.073 --> 44:28.174
I said, no.

44:30.377 --> 44:32.943
We found divorce
papers in her office.

44:32.945 --> 44:34.448
Hell of a lot of money.

44:36.550 --> 44:38.215
That's personal.

44:38.217 --> 44:39.386
We're working on things.

44:40.286 --> 44:42.086
But still no excuse for lying.

44:42.088 --> 44:43.989
And what does this have
to do with Leslie?

44:44.990 --> 44:46.990
You were in her home
on November 25th.

44:46.992 --> 44:48.861
You had choice words for her.

44:52.499 --> 44:53.933
You been drinking again?

44:57.236 --> 44:58.505
Leave.

45:00.306 --> 45:01.307
Now.

45:06.546 --> 45:08.448
- What did you say to them?
- I didn't say anything.

45:10.550 --> 45:11.984
Just get in the house.

45:24.464 --> 45:25.665
Made groceries.

45:27.032 --> 45:29.066
I thought I told you
not to leave the house.

45:29.068 --> 45:31.034
I'm feeling good.

45:31.036 --> 45:33.440
I was thinking of asking
JW for my old job back.

45:34.508 --> 45:36.273
I don't think they're
looking for help.

45:36.275 --> 45:38.976
Well, there are other jobs too.

45:38.978 --> 45:40.012
Yeah, I...

45:41.313 --> 45:44.047
I don't think there's going to
be much work out there for you.

45:44.049 --> 45:45.717
What am I supposed to do?

45:45.719 --> 45:47.452
Stay home and out of trouble?

45:47.454 --> 45:48.588
You sound just like Daddy.

45:52.592 --> 45:55.392
- You know, I'm doing you a favor.
- Some favor.

45:55.394 --> 45:58.598
Yo, maybe next time we don't
catch the call in time.

46:08.007 --> 46:10.142
I heard JW's Mama died anyway.

46:21.120 --> 46:22.656
What was it like
working for them?

46:24.491 --> 46:26.225
Mostly worked with Miss Ashley.

46:28.093 --> 46:29.663
JW wasn't around much.

46:32.466 --> 46:33.498
Where was he?

46:35.669 --> 46:36.736
I don't know.

47:02.562 --> 47:04.531
Mrs. Waguespack, please.

47:10.135 --> 47:13.640
If you talk to me about JW,
I can help you.

47:18.545 --> 47:19.646
You've done enough.

48:19.606 --> 48:22.472
You been drinking tonight,
Mr. Waguespack?

48:25.612 --> 48:27.277
Where's your better half at?

48:27.279 --> 48:29.214
I'm going to need you to
step out of the truck.

48:34.153 --> 48:35.487
We really going to do this now?

48:42.762 --> 48:44.729
What? You want
the alphabet backwards?

48:44.731 --> 48:47.433
- Maybe stand on one leg, touch my nose? Is that...
- Turn around.

48:51.638 --> 48:53.303
Okay.

49:02.448 --> 49:05.652
- This ain't legal.
- Her body was found on your property.

49:06.552 --> 49:10.187
God! If my wife was going to leave me,
why would I kill our lawyer?

49:10.189 --> 49:12.957
You have a motive, no alibi,

49:12.959 --> 49:15.461
and a witness that
puts you at the scene.

49:17.329 --> 49:18.464
Who?

49:19.498 --> 49:22.767
- Me.
- You know how this is going to go down.

49:22.769 --> 49:24.702
Mama's going to come
down to the station,

49:24.704 --> 49:27.674
and you are going to get torn
a new one by the Sheriff.

49:55.935 --> 49:57.469
You want to talk about it?

49:59.304 --> 50:00.272
No.

50:01.540 --> 50:02.474
You sure?

50:05.644 --> 50:06.545
What?

50:10.416 --> 50:11.350
I'm...

50:14.854 --> 50:16.856
I'm going crazy here, B.

50:21.627 --> 50:23.260
Can we talk about this later?

51:07.406 --> 51:08.507
You ready?

51:10.442 --> 51:11.911
We're not going to be late.

51:15.081 --> 51:16.348
Sissy?

52:33.659 --> 52:34.994
This what you were
doing instead?

52:41.868 --> 52:44.971
When I was using I used to
know what every day was for.

52:48.507 --> 52:49.508
But now...

52:58.417 --> 53:00.053
You can't keep me
here like this.

53:32.551 --> 53:34.118
This is what y'all do all day?

53:34.120 --> 53:35.752
When we got to.

53:35.754 --> 53:37.456
My tax dollars at work, huh?

53:46.832 --> 53:48.531
I got to pee.

53:48.533 --> 53:50.067
All right.

53:50.069 --> 53:51.801
The woods are right there, girl.

53:51.803 --> 53:53.971
- I ain't going in no woods.
- What?

53:53.973 --> 53:56.240
Why'd you drink the whole
damn thing, then?

53:56.242 --> 53:57.707
I like my Diet Coke.

53:57.709 --> 53:58.775
Come on now.

54:23.036 --> 54:25.269
Shit.

54:25.271 --> 54:27.238
I'd have been
better off at home.

54:27.240 --> 54:29.106
Ain't got nobody
else who can do this?

54:29.108 --> 54:30.109
No.

54:32.278 --> 54:33.947
They know you're
here though, right?

54:36.950 --> 54:39.849
People going to think you're
weird, watching them like this.

54:39.851 --> 54:43.089
- So?
- So, you don't care what people think no more?

54:44.856 --> 54:48.460
Shit. If it was me, I'd probably
get a little obsessed too.

54:56.269 --> 55:00.104
I thought it was real cute at the beginning,
but y'all starting to piss me off.

55:00.106 --> 55:01.771
This can be over
whenever you want.

55:01.773 --> 55:02.674
I...

55:06.980 --> 55:08.878
I didn't kill your friend.

55:08.880 --> 55:12.016
I wish I knew who did, 'cause
then you'd stay off my ass.

55:12.018 --> 55:14.720
All you got to do is tell me
what happened that night.

55:20.592 --> 55:21.760
Y'all have a good day.

55:29.168 --> 55:30.736
Now I really got to pee.

55:52.891 --> 55:54.325
There you go, Mama.

55:56.928 --> 55:58.928
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

55:58.930 --> 56:00.565
Just give me,
just give me a minute.

56:01.300 --> 56:03.869
I'm not going anywhere.

56:10.043 --> 56:15.046
My Daddy took me
to Chicago once in 1955.

56:15.048 --> 56:18.149
It was so loud I couldn't
even hear myself think.

56:18.151 --> 56:23.254
And then we went outside, and a
man on a bicycle almost drove me over.

56:23.256 --> 56:25.688
And people were rushing
this way and that way

56:25.690 --> 56:28.392
and this way. And those
buildings were so tall

56:28.394 --> 56:31.064
you could barely see the sky.

56:32.697 --> 56:36.200
After that, I said,
"I am staying right here.

56:36.202 --> 56:38.635
I am not going anywhere."

56:38.637 --> 56:40.870
Yeah, you're not going anywhere.

56:40.872 --> 56:41.907
What?

56:46.878 --> 56:48.013
All right, let's go.

56:53.652 --> 56:55.754
What do you think
about hiring Sissy?

56:57.423 --> 56:59.123
Hmm?

56:59.125 --> 57:00.357
You sure that's a good idea?

57:00.359 --> 57:03.762
I mean, Mama's on serious meds.

57:05.231 --> 57:07.599
I don't know, I think it
could be good for both of them.

57:09.801 --> 57:11.701
- Think about it.
- Okay.

57:11.703 --> 57:12.969
All right, bye,
Mama, I love you.

57:12.971 --> 57:14.340
Bye, Miss Doris.

57:41.700 --> 57:42.901
- Hey.
- Hey.

57:44.470 --> 57:46.470
The sheriff said that,
uh, he thought this

57:46.472 --> 57:48.141
would be better coming from me.

57:56.449 --> 57:57.849
Is this for real?

57:59.318 --> 58:01.285
JW says you've been
harassing him.

58:03.021 --> 58:06.055
He came at me,
did he tell you that?

58:06.057 --> 58:08.791
All I know is that you've
got to stay at least

58:08.793 --> 58:10.630
1,000 feet away from him.

58:16.902 --> 58:17.903
Sorry.

58:52.103 --> 58:53.138
How bad is she?

58:54.172 --> 58:57.040
She clears up
every now and then.

58:57.042 --> 58:57.943
She walk?

58:59.077 --> 59:00.178
Not really.

59:05.050 --> 59:05.951
Good.

59:16.027 --> 59:17.463
You sure about this?

59:19.164 --> 59:20.165
Come on.

59:25.804 --> 59:27.571
Emergency contacts
are on the counter,

59:27.573 --> 59:29.874
and there's a spare
key in the shed.

59:30.942 --> 59:33.943
All her meds are labeled, and if
she doesn't want to eat then

59:33.945 --> 59:36.047
there's a shake in
the fridge you can give her.

59:42.588 --> 59:44.022
I think we're good.

59:52.163 --> 59:53.466
Don't let
her smoke too much.

01:00:34.873 --> 01:00:38.342
I should have known a piece of
paper wasn't going to keep you away.

01:00:38.344 --> 01:00:39.909
How'd you find me?

01:00:39.911 --> 01:00:40.943
You think you're
the first person

01:00:40.945 --> 01:00:42.315
to get hung up on a case?

01:00:58.364 --> 01:00:59.565
How long you going to sit here?

01:01:00.499 --> 01:01:02.267
As
long as it takes.

01:01:03.803 --> 01:01:06.670
It was bad enough you stuffed him
in the back of a cruiser for no reason.

01:01:06.672 --> 01:01:09.038
But they find out
you stalking him

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:11.009
and things can get
real bad for you.

01:01:12.277 --> 01:01:13.479
If they find out.

01:01:21.454 --> 01:01:24.621
You know you're not the only
person who cared about Leslie.

01:01:24.623 --> 01:01:26.590
I want to get this
son of a bitch too.

01:01:26.592 --> 01:01:28.594
Trying to get in her pants
ain't the same thing.

01:01:32.997 --> 01:01:33.898
Sorry.

01:01:35.401 --> 01:01:36.301
No.

01:01:38.404 --> 01:01:39.505
I didn't mean to...

01:01:43.108 --> 01:01:46.077
She was your friend, I get it.

01:01:48.581 --> 01:01:51.116
But I don't think she'd want you
ruining your life over this.

01:01:53.586 --> 01:01:55.120
You got your sister back.

01:01:56.354 --> 01:01:59.090
- You got some money coming in.
- What are you talking about?

01:02:00.024 --> 01:02:02.158
I mean, people are
starting to sell.

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:04.160
Look, you... I mean, you've
got a chance to start over,

01:02:04.162 --> 01:02:06.362
and I think you ought to
think about taking it.

01:02:19.377 --> 01:02:20.646
All right.

01:05:12.283 --> 01:05:13.551
Can I get two more of these?

01:05:17.623 --> 01:05:20.558
I haven't been here since
Leslie and me had fake IDs.

01:05:27.398 --> 01:05:28.767
Y'all two were together.

01:05:32.671 --> 01:05:33.571
I'm sorry.

01:05:35.908 --> 01:05:37.473
Did she find out about
you coming here?

01:05:37.475 --> 01:05:38.777
No, no.

01:05:40.946 --> 01:05:43.312
That's a hell of an alibi.

01:05:43.314 --> 01:05:44.515
Does your mama know?

01:05:45.884 --> 01:05:47.585
We have an understanding.

01:05:48.754 --> 01:05:50.321
But not with your wife?

01:05:51.624 --> 01:05:54.225
A secret ain't much of a secret
when you start telling folks.

01:05:55.728 --> 01:05:58.962
So when you found out about her
fixing to leave, it wasn't about the money?

01:05:58.964 --> 01:05:59.865
I got money.

01:06:01.399 --> 01:06:02.668
It's about more than that.

01:06:04.837 --> 01:06:07.538
Gay Waguespacks are
bad for business.

01:06:10.643 --> 01:06:12.845
Mama's trying to do
something important here.

01:06:13.846 --> 01:06:16.479
I'm a part of that.
But because of this murder,

01:06:16.481 --> 01:06:18.547
Southcrest is pulling
out of our deal.

01:06:18.549 --> 01:06:21.285
- So, I didn't do this.
- Okay then, who did?

01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:24.253
I don't know.

01:06:24.255 --> 01:06:27.425
But when there's this much
money involved, shit happens.

01:06:52.483 --> 01:06:55.317
What the hell
is Jimmy Falgot doing here?

01:06:55.319 --> 01:06:56.454
He looks pissed.

01:07:03.494 --> 01:07:04.529
Thank you.

01:07:09.902 --> 01:07:11.870
I owe you an apology.

01:07:13.638 --> 01:07:14.572
Yes.

01:07:15.606 --> 01:07:17.642
I heard you and JW spoke.

01:07:18.777 --> 01:07:20.643
Why didn't you say nothing?

01:07:20.645 --> 01:07:23.046
Do you think Jimmy Falgot
and the rest of them

01:07:23.048 --> 01:07:26.682
would sell their properties
if they knew about him?

01:07:26.684 --> 01:07:28.219
We could have kept that quiet.

01:07:30.055 --> 01:07:32.288
I appreciate the sentiment.

01:07:32.290 --> 01:07:34.523
But the nature of our
family doesn't allow

01:07:34.525 --> 01:07:37.493
for those kinds of
proclivities to become public.

01:07:37.495 --> 01:07:39.562
So, you made him get married.

01:07:39.564 --> 01:07:42.333
Nobody made him do anything.

01:07:43.534 --> 01:07:46.337
We decided it was for the best.

01:07:49.775 --> 01:07:52.343
We're going to need to know
what you're offering everyone.

01:07:54.046 --> 01:07:57.914
Y'all will understand if
I'm not particularly inclined.

01:07:57.916 --> 01:08:00.716
Even if you hadn't
been harassing my son,

01:08:00.718 --> 01:08:03.619
that information is privileged.

01:08:03.621 --> 01:08:05.356
We're going to find
out one way or another.

01:08:07.558 --> 01:08:10.495
So I can assume y'all are here
with the sheriff's blessing?

01:08:13.464 --> 01:08:15.531
We're just hoping that you're
willing to help us out.

01:08:15.533 --> 01:08:17.834
Leslie was killed
over that money.

01:08:17.836 --> 01:08:18.871
You owe her.

01:08:19.872 --> 01:08:22.573
I seem to recall offering
you that money too.

01:08:23.809 --> 01:08:26.575
Maybe so, but I didn't kill her.

01:08:26.577 --> 01:08:32.048
This is a backwoods murder
Miss Leblanc, not a conspiracy.

01:08:32.050 --> 01:08:34.785
If someone wanted to
profit off of Southcrest,

01:08:34.787 --> 01:08:37.988
killing Leslie was
the wrong way to go about it.

01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:39.890
What company would
want to be associated

01:08:39.892 --> 01:08:42.292
with the murder of
their opposing council?

01:08:44.395 --> 01:08:46.865
I think I've given
y'all enough of my time.

01:08:48.033 --> 01:08:49.933
Come on.

01:08:49.935 --> 01:08:50.966
Thank you, ma'am.

01:10:35.706 --> 01:10:38.208
Hey, Doc. Uh,

01:10:38.210 --> 01:10:40.913
those ligature marks. Could
they have come from a rosary?

01:10:43.115 --> 01:10:44.515
Yeah, a rosary.

01:10:58.562 --> 01:10:59.697
Bernadette.

01:11:01.532 --> 01:11:04.000
This used to be your
Pop's place, right?

01:11:04.002 --> 01:11:05.901
The barn's new,
but he built the house

01:11:05.903 --> 01:11:08.073
with his own hands back in '43.

01:11:11.243 --> 01:11:13.946
Mr. Jimmy, I need to ask
you a personal question.

01:11:17.149 --> 01:11:18.849
Is this about your
friend Leslie?

01:11:20.218 --> 01:11:22.187
How much did Mary offer you?

01:11:23.888 --> 01:11:26.224
I'm not sure that's
any of your business.

01:11:27.625 --> 01:11:29.127
You seen any of that money?

01:11:33.165 --> 01:11:34.632
Bernadette...

01:11:35.666 --> 01:11:36.934
I've got a lot of work to do.

01:11:57.788 --> 01:11:58.689
Hey...

01:12:00.758 --> 01:12:02.860
how much they offer you
for your mama's place?

01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:06.664
Same as a lot of folks.

01:12:07.665 --> 01:12:09.500
Have you heard from them since?

01:12:10.335 --> 01:12:11.236
No.

01:12:12.903 --> 01:12:13.804
Why?

01:12:15.007 --> 01:12:18.676
Have you seen anybody move
or any construction happening?

01:12:20.611 --> 01:12:22.212
No.

01:12:22.214 --> 01:12:24.980
As far as I can tell,
no one's going to get nothing

01:12:24.982 --> 01:12:26.951
until we catch whoever
killed Leslie.

01:12:30.621 --> 01:12:32.921
And I went to see
Jimmy the other day.

01:12:32.923 --> 01:12:36.692
And I think Mary's offering
him a hell of a lot more

01:12:36.694 --> 01:12:39.262
than you and me.
And he's not the only one.

01:12:39.264 --> 01:12:41.164
Right, but if Southcrest
is putting their deal

01:12:41.166 --> 01:12:44.067
with Mary on hold,
then what's it matter?

01:12:44.069 --> 01:12:46.204
Our guy didn't know it
was going to happen.

01:12:47.139 --> 01:12:49.972
So, you think it
was Jimmy, one of them?

01:12:49.974 --> 01:12:52.308
I think it was someone
she knew better than that.

01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:55.245
Someone she would let in
the house late at night.

01:12:55.247 --> 01:12:56.945
I mean, I think it has
to do with money,

01:12:56.947 --> 01:13:01.817
but I also think it's much
more personal than that.

01:13:01.819 --> 01:13:05.055
- But where you getting all this from?
- Well, he went into her house

01:13:05.057 --> 01:13:07.123
and he didn't bring
a murder weapon.

01:13:07.125 --> 01:13:09.127
I mean, maybe he didn't even
go over there to kill her.

01:13:10.228 --> 01:13:11.862
How, how did you know?

01:13:12.963 --> 01:13:14.897
She was strangled
with her rosary.

01:13:38.656 --> 01:13:40.092
Tried the front.

01:13:48.999 --> 01:13:50.701
You've been doing some
work on the side.

01:13:53.971 --> 01:13:55.739
JW, Mary, Jimmy.

01:13:58.008 --> 01:14:00.611
Want to explain why you
ignored a protective order?

01:14:04.815 --> 01:14:06.982
JW looked good for it
'cause of the divorce,

01:14:06.984 --> 01:14:08.052
but I was wrong.

01:14:11.223 --> 01:14:13.956
Now I know that Leslie's
murder was caused by Southcrest,

01:14:13.958 --> 01:14:15.824
and Mary's trying
to stonewall us

01:14:15.826 --> 01:14:18.128
'cause she knows that we're
close to finding something.

01:14:18.130 --> 01:14:20.863
Look, I know y'all were friends,

01:14:20.865 --> 01:14:23.799
- but what could be so damn personal?
- I'm close.

01:14:23.801 --> 01:14:24.802
I know it.

01:14:28.072 --> 01:14:29.106
I'm sorry.

01:14:31.476 --> 01:14:34.745
I'm going to need your
badge and your weapon.

01:15:20.958 --> 01:15:22.927
- Double.
- You got it.

01:15:37.041 --> 01:15:39.109
- This is on me.
- Thank you.

01:15:40.844 --> 01:15:42.844
Doesn't John work
the door on Thursday nights?

01:15:42.846 --> 01:15:45.415
John? I had to let him go.

01:15:45.417 --> 01:15:46.882
Let him go?

01:15:46.884 --> 01:15:48.884
Yeah, drinking on the job.

01:15:48.886 --> 01:15:50.488
The man can't hold his liquor.

01:15:51.956 --> 01:15:53.323
John Landry?

01:15:53.325 --> 01:15:55.491
The only John I know.

01:15:55.493 --> 01:15:58.126
Wait, I've been driving
him here for weeks.

01:15:58.128 --> 01:16:01.865
I don't know what to tell you. Some
people just want to keep up appearances.

01:16:03.501 --> 01:16:05.002
When was that?

01:16:07.071 --> 01:16:10.908
About the time Leslie...
But, well, you know.

01:16:12.977 --> 01:16:16.346
And the night you fired him,
he stay till close?

01:16:16.348 --> 01:16:18.080
Hell no.

01:16:18.082 --> 01:16:20.818
I tossed his ass as soon
as he started mouthing off.

01:17:12.269 --> 01:17:14.539
750,000.

01:18:14.466 --> 01:18:15.165
<i>No.</i>

01:18:17.369 --> 01:18:18.936
<i>What are you doing, Roland?</i>

01:18:21.606 --> 01:18:22.873
<i>Face front.</i>

01:18:25.142 --> 01:18:26.310
<i>And keep driving.</i>

01:18:38.423 --> 01:18:40.088
You all right, Mr. John?

01:18:40.090 --> 01:18:41.191
Yep, fine!

01:19:41.018 --> 01:19:42.317
Shit!

01:20:01.338 --> 01:20:02.740
Think I'm going to head out.

01:20:03.641 --> 01:20:05.373
No!

01:20:07.545 --> 01:20:09.346
Can you just stay
a little longer?

01:20:30.768 --> 01:20:32.202
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:20:34.404 --> 01:20:36.006
What... What's up?

01:20:47.317 --> 01:20:49.752
'Cause
I wanted to tell you

01:20:49.754 --> 01:20:53.088
that I think you're
the most beautiful woman...

01:20:53.090 --> 01:20:55.390
- John.
- Uh, just listen, like, you're this...

01:20:55.392 --> 01:20:56.726
- No.
- Hey.

01:20:56.728 --> 01:20:58.561
Maybe we can, we can
talk about this...

01:20:58.563 --> 01:20:59.597
Leslie.

01:21:04.736 --> 01:21:07.135
- John, no.
- You should put on a coffee.

01:21:07.137 --> 01:21:08.638
- Just put on a pot of coffee.
- No.

01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:10.472
- Put on a fucking pot of coffee.
- No!

01:21:10.474 --> 01:21:12.274
What the fuck?
Put on a pot of coffee!

01:21:12.276 --> 01:21:13.743
- No!
- Put it on!

01:21:13.745 --> 01:21:15.578
- No!
- Coffee! Where's the...

01:21:46.611 --> 01:21:48.310
Mama?

01:21:56.821 --> 01:21:57.722
Mama.

01:22:12.302 --> 01:22:14.839
- Hey.
- Hey, I'm here for Sissy.

01:22:16.306 --> 01:22:19.176
You sure? She's, uh,
just watching TV with Mama.

01:22:22.312 --> 01:22:23.547
Can I come in?

01:22:25.582 --> 01:22:26.483
Sure.

01:22:29.621 --> 01:22:31.689
Uh, went by the bar earlier.

01:22:32.957 --> 01:22:34.191
Yeah.

01:22:36.293 --> 01:22:37.559
I meant to tell you about that.

01:22:37.561 --> 01:22:39.363
It just didn't work out.

01:22:40.765 --> 01:22:42.199
Hey, B.

01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:44.468
How y'all doing?

01:22:47.872 --> 01:22:49.506
Yeah, we, we good.

01:22:54.646 --> 01:22:58.346
Uh, you can go Sissy.
I'm, I'm not going back out.

01:22:58.348 --> 01:23:00.384
Y'all mind if I finish this?
I got to know who did it.

01:23:14.464 --> 01:23:16.266
Take Mama upstairs.

01:23:19.737 --> 01:23:20.938
Now.

01:23:28.846 --> 01:23:31.279
But I don't want to go.

01:23:31.281 --> 01:23:32.516
Don't move!

01:23:34.018 --> 01:23:36.451
Johnny, what are you doing?

01:23:36.453 --> 01:23:38.319
It's fine.
It's all right, Miss Doris.

01:23:38.321 --> 01:23:39.789
Shut up!

01:23:39.791 --> 01:23:42.457
You know what? Whatever's
going to go down here,

01:23:42.459 --> 01:23:43.961
they don't got to be involved.

01:23:45.362 --> 01:23:48.530
- It don't even got to get violent.
- Shut up!

01:23:50.333 --> 01:23:51.867
No! You son of a bitch!

01:23:51.869 --> 01:23:53.803
Don't you... Don't.
Don't touch it.

01:23:56.040 --> 01:23:57.605
Give me your gun.

01:23:57.607 --> 01:23:59.911
Johnny, what did you do?

01:24:01.344 --> 01:24:02.878
Oh, please.

01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:04.247
I'm taking out my weapon.

01:24:04.982 --> 01:24:07.315
- All right? There it is.
- Slow. Slow!

01:24:07.317 --> 01:24:09.051
What's the plan here, John?

01:24:09.053 --> 01:24:11.854
You're going to put
it on the floor. Kick it.

01:24:13.457 --> 01:24:15.457
It's coming,
help is coming.

01:24:15.459 --> 01:24:17.559
Okay. You know what? Let's talk.

01:24:17.561 --> 01:24:20.830
All right? Let's talk about
how you want this to go.

01:24:20.832 --> 01:24:23.899
- There's nothing to talk about.
- Oh, yes, there is.

01:24:23.901 --> 01:24:27.569
Please, just breath,
just breath, breath,

01:24:27.571 --> 01:24:29.372
breath. I know.

01:24:34.377 --> 01:24:36.311
I didn't go over
there to hurt her.

01:24:36.313 --> 01:24:37.915
I know, I know.

01:24:39.649 --> 01:24:42.852
- I just got drunk.
- I know you've got it hard.

01:24:42.854 --> 01:24:44.686
You've got two jobs.

01:24:44.688 --> 01:24:45.957
You got Mama.

01:24:47.390 --> 01:24:51.093
But 750,000, now,

01:24:51.095 --> 01:24:52.897
that'll make things
a little easier, right?

01:24:57.367 --> 01:24:59.736
You still think that
she got killed over money?

01:25:04.075 --> 01:25:05.943
I loved her, Bernadette.

01:25:08.745 --> 01:25:12.449
But I saw you leaving
her house that night.

01:25:16.586 --> 01:25:18.622
You've been lying
to me this whole time.

01:25:22.059 --> 01:25:24.561
You let me humiliate myself.

01:25:27.497 --> 01:25:28.900
She was never going to love me.

01:25:29.867 --> 01:25:31.568
You didn't even know her.

01:25:35.772 --> 01:25:36.773
I loved her.

01:25:38.575 --> 01:25:40.109
And you're saying she died

01:25:40.111 --> 01:25:43.413
because you couldn't
take no for an answer?

01:25:44.681 --> 01:25:46.050
You're pathetic.

01:25:49.854 --> 01:25:51.753
Shut up.

01:25:51.755 --> 01:25:53.889
How you going
to explain all this?

01:25:53.891 --> 01:25:56.826
- The car's outside.
- Please.

01:25:56.828 --> 01:26:00.461
Sissy's blood.
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

01:26:00.463 --> 01:26:02.832
Why don't you just
give me the gun, huh?

01:26:02.834 --> 01:26:04.467
- Just give me the gun.
- Shut up.

01:26:05.970 --> 01:26:07.402
Okay.

01:26:09.874 --> 01:26:11.075
Mm-hmm.

01:26:12.977 --> 01:26:14.043
I can't.

01:27:04.561 --> 01:27:05.627
Okay, okay.

01:27:05.629 --> 01:27:06.663
All right?

01:27:08.698 --> 01:27:10.700
- Is that morphine?
- Yeah.

01:27:13.603 --> 01:27:14.771
She don't want it.

01:27:21.811 --> 01:27:23.112
She'll be all right.

01:27:23.114 --> 01:27:24.514
It went right through.

01:27:27.550 --> 01:27:28.451
John?

01:27:32.589 --> 01:27:33.490
Yeah.

01:27:35.558 --> 01:27:36.928
You find out why?

01:27:39.030 --> 01:27:40.730
It was for the money.

01:27:44.268 --> 01:27:47.138
Bernadette... I'm sorry.

01:29:04.181 --> 01:29:07.116
I thought this
might be your last stop.

01:29:07.118 --> 01:29:08.952
Hope I'm not interrupting.

01:29:09.886 --> 01:29:11.719
What are you doing here?

01:29:11.721 --> 01:29:12.889
I came to thank you.

01:29:14.158 --> 01:29:16.027
After what I put y'all through?

01:29:17.694 --> 01:29:20.995
You did what you had to do
for the person you loved.

01:29:20.997 --> 01:29:24.567
And in so doing you made
sure Pont Minou survives.

01:29:26.603 --> 01:29:27.871
If you want to call it that.

01:29:31.875 --> 01:29:36.579
I hear that, uh, house in
the Bywater's still up for sale.

01:29:42.253 --> 01:29:43.751
This is a little something extra

01:29:43.753 --> 01:29:46.155
from me to help you get started,

01:29:46.157 --> 01:29:48.958
because I still think
she'd want better for you.

01:29:51.295 --> 01:29:52.329
She would.

01:29:54.131 --> 01:29:56.898
But not like this.

01:30:22.692 --> 01:30:24.794
I might actually
miss this place a little bit.

01:30:26.029 --> 01:30:27.063
I won't.
