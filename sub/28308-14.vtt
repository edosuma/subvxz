We're kidding, we're kidding.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
I'm not doing that.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
No. Keep going.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Yo, we can't let that opportunity slip.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Producer: 3, 2, 1.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Today we're in the streets approaching strangers

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
and giving them lessons about manners.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
All: Well... [ Laughter ]

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
'Cause it's right there.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
It's right there.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
I mean, you're, like, looking at it.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
I mean, it's right there.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
Joe: How are we not using urban bungee.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
I'm not -- Look at his face.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
We're joking. We're joking. We're kidding.

18:23.000 --> 18:28.000
I'm not laughing, I'm getting so frustrated.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
Today we're in the streets going up to strangers

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
and giving them lessons about manners.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
If you can't successfully tell someone

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
how to live their life, you lose.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Joe: All right, Sal, you ready for your turn?

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
Let's do it.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
Hey, gents, what's really going on today?

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
So, we have our list.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
Yeah, so we did the cherry picker.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
We did the bungee jump.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
And we just continue down the list of ways

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
to mess with Sal.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
Sal, this guy's got no tie on. That's not nice.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
Excuse me.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Suit jacket, no tie?

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Q: Whoa! You know, those sneakers

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
are jumping off the screen right now.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
They really are. Alright.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
Don't stand next to that wet cement

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
being poured in front of you.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
Yeah, that'd be like a punishment if you had nice shoes

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
on and you had to walk through...

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
All: Well...

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Maybe you have to walk through the wet cement

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
with your brand new shoes, buddy.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Guys... You see it right there?

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
You see that guy pouring cement

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
for no reason on Union Square in New York City?

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Can I just say a couple things?

19:23.000 --> 19:27.000
I also noticed him, and I noticed

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
that it was very peculiar.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
So, Sal, all you have to do is step into the wet cement

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
and then walk over to the bungee thing and get on it.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Those shoes are toast.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
I'm just kidding.

19:39.000 --> 19:43.000
[ Laughter ]

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
We're screwing with you, buddy.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
This is amazing. We're F'ing with you.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
Okay. Oh, my God.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Okay, so I'm just gonna go back out and do this regular bit?

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
All: Yes.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Yeah, yeah.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
Alright, ready, boys?

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Oh, what's that right behind you?

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
There's a truck in the shot.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
What is that, a cat adoption going on?

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
A cat adoption truck?

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Guys, I'm gonna need to know now.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
All: Well...

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Maybe, Sal.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
Maybe you've got to go to that truck, pick up a cat...

20:14.000 --> 20:19.000
Joe: Walk through the cement, and then bungee jump.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Cat event.

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
I guess so.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Sal, it's really not your punishment.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
-I'm supposed to be here? -Are you supposed to be here?

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
Sal, they're really having a cat event, you idiot.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
So, am I not supposed to be here?

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
Man #2: Are you volunteering with us?

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
No. Are you here for me?

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
I am here because we're doing an adoption event.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
You dumbass, it's the real adoption event.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Man #2: You want to help out? We need help.

20:46.000 --> 20:50.000
I do, I'll be right back. I just got to clarify...

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
There's no way that this also happens to be here.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
They're here every week, buddy. They're here all the time.

20:55.000 --> 20:59.000
You're telling me that the bungee jump,

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
the guy making blocks of cement for no reason...

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
[ Laughter ]

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
...and a full-on cat adoption event

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
that is literally called Cat Event,

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
with that cat.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
You're telling me that all three of these things

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
have nothing to do with me?

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
That's correct. That's nothing, buddy.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
Get back to the bit.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
This is not a punishment for me?

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
No. I'm sorry, buddy.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
We see the stuff in the cameras and we run with it.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
Joe: You can go to your bit now.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
Man #3: Hey, yo, dude. Hey, yo.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
Yo.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
Yo, Sal. Yo, Sal!

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's him.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
-Oh, they're city workers. -Hey, man. How are you?

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Murr: Is that manure?

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
God forbid, if you say that I need to do it with manure.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
All: Well!

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
Somebody tell me what's going on.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
Please, I'm gonna start crying.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Please, I'm gonna start crying.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
Sal, why don't you go over

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
and help him out with your bare hands.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Yeah, Sal, why don't you check to see

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
if they're doing their job.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
See if there's maybe something hidden in the manure.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
Who knows? Yeah, you here for me?

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
No, I saw you guys shooting. That's cool.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
Can we take a picture with you?

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
You're from "Impractical Jokers", right?

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
Yeah, are you here for me?

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Dude, he's a fan.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
I'm not suppose to touch this manure?

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
I'd prefer if you didn't.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
I'm just so confused because --

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
Am I supposed to help you guys with this?

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
I'm not here, man -- Do you guys not --

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
I don't know -- -Look at how confused they are.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
They're park workers, you dumbass.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
All right, thanks, guys.

22:29.000 --> 22:34.000
So, you're telling me that on cue two barrels of manure

22:34.000 --> 22:39.000
pulled up and the cat van pulled up.

22:39.000 --> 22:46.000
Do I right now need to adopt a cat, put my hands in manure,

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
cement my feet, and jump off that bungee thing?

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
No, we're screwing with you, buddy.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
They're park workers, clearly.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
Guys, I can't take it anymore.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
Joe: Get back to the bit.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
Sal, yell at the guy in the restaurant

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
from across the way to sit up straight.

[ Laughs ]

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
Is that Sal's father?

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
What a coincidence.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Wait, this means this  is a punishment.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
No, it's not.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
You're dad's not here.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
We just saw him in the park.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
You father's here in the park.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
What are you doing?

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
What are you doing? You working here?

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Come on. I'm waiting for a friend.

[ Laughter ]

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
Please stop. What is going on?

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
Welcome to your punishment, Sal.

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
That was it. Psychological torture.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Look at your face!

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Am I done?

23:46.000 --> 23:49.000
All: Well!
