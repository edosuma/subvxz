WEBVTT

00:02.701 --> 00:04.400
I decided not to produce the movie.

00:03.967 --> 00:05.368
There's this girl that...

00:05.434 --> 00:08.167
I'm kind of in love with, and...

00:08.234 --> 00:11.034
I couldn't be away from her for another day.

00:11.101 --> 00:13.301
I know the label's gonna run a lot smoother

00:13.368 --> 00:14.600
with you at the helm.

00:14.667 --> 00:16.300
I'm not here to run the label.

00:16.367 --> 00:17.834
I'm here to close it.

00:17.900 --> 00:19.934
You're mad because I want you to move out,

00:20.001 --> 00:22.867
but it's only because I'm trying to step things up with Millie.

00:22.934 --> 00:24.834
You trying to get rid of me with your naked ass.

00:24.900 --> 00:26.001
It ain't gonna work.

00:26.067 --> 00:27.134
You know earlier when...

00:27.201 --> 00:29.301
when I said I miss David?

00:29.368 --> 00:30.600
What happened, Quinn? You said he...

00:30.667 --> 00:31.767
I left him.

00:31.834 --> 00:33.368
Does that girl look familiar to you?

00:33.434 --> 00:35.067
Yeah, she was at the party today. Why?

00:35.134 --> 00:37.234
She says she slept with you on the road, Nate,

00:36.101 --> 00:39.034
and she's going public.

00:54.217 --> 00:57.084
And where will you run...

00:57.151 --> 00:58.884
back to the life of a peasant harlot?

00:58.950 --> 01:00.351
Perhaps I will.

01:00.417 --> 01:02.984
But should I return to a life of more meager means,

01:03.050 --> 01:05.417
I will do so with my dignity intact,

01:05.483 --> 01:08.284
my heart pure and true.

01:08.351 --> 01:11.084
And yet you had no dignity nor purity

01:11.151 --> 01:13.884
in my bed a fortnight ago.

01:15.151 --> 01:18.184
Meager means, indeed.

01:18.251 --> 01:19.084
Harlot!

01:20.884 --> 01:22.817
Leave the dress!

01:24.618 --> 01:25.750
Millie was right.

01:25.817 --> 01:27.351
Alex DuprÃ© is the perfect choice

01:27.417 --> 01:29.351
to be the face of the new campaign.

01:29.417 --> 01:31.817
She's smart. She's talented.

01:31.884 --> 01:34.117
She is crazy beautiful.

01:34.184 --> 01:36.117
Julian?
I'm shaving!

01:36.184 --> 01:38.251
How come this movie never came out?

01:38.317 --> 01:40.217
Because smart and talented and beautiful

01:40.284 --> 01:42.050
got all hopped up on goofballs

01:42.117 --> 01:43.284
and had to be checked into rehab.

01:44.518 --> 01:45.783
By the way, those dailies are top secret.

01:45.850 --> 01:48.484
I had to call in about a dozen favors to get 'em.

01:48.551 --> 01:51.584
Aww, my baby's so good to me.

01:55.650 --> 01:57.917
Damn.

01:57.984 --> 02:00.850
I am really gonna like this living-together thing.

02:02.717 --> 02:04.518
I want you to move your stuff in, okay?

02:04.584 --> 02:06.451
This is our house now, not just mine.

02:06.518 --> 02:08.184
Good.

02:10.383 --> 02:12.518
Well, then how would you feel about going back

02:12.584 --> 02:14.217
to our bedroom for a little while?

02:14.284 --> 02:17.850
I'd make a joke about meager means, but...

02:17.917 --> 02:20.551
it would simply be untrue.

02:26.551 --> 02:27.783
Hey.

02:27.850 --> 02:30.317
You know I'm not judging you, right?

02:30.384 --> 02:33.151
Clay, listen, man, you've known me for a long time now.

02:33.217 --> 02:35.050
I don't care what that woman says.

02:35.117 --> 02:36.917
I did not sleep with her, all right?

02:36.984 --> 02:38.417
All right.

02:38.484 --> 02:40.518
It's unbelievable to me that she could just show up

02:40.584 --> 02:42.683
and spout a bunch of lies,
and the next thing you know,

02:42.750 --> 02:45.084
I'm in the headlines, my family's in the headlines,

02:45.151 --> 02:46.917
and I'm guilty before I'm innocent.

02:46.984 --> 02:48.551
Don't freak out. You're not in the headlines yet.

02:48.618 --> 02:49.950
And believe it or not, this kind of thing,

02:50.017 --> 02:50.884
it happens a lot.

02:50.950 --> 02:52.417
You're a public figure,

02:52.484 --> 02:53.984
and they know you make a lot of money.

02:54.050 --> 02:55.783
I'm in a contract year, Clay.

02:55.850 --> 02:57.650
I know. So, here's what you're gonna do.

02:57.717 --> 02:59.850
You're gonna stay in shape,
you're gonna stay focused,

02:59.917 --> 03:01.050
and you're gonna let me handle it.

03:01.117 --> 03:02.017
All right?

03:03.351 --> 03:05.351
All right.

03:05.417 --> 03:10.484
*yeah*

03:15.850 --> 03:18.017
It has been ringing off the hook.

03:18.084 --> 03:21.618
*waves crash along* ...

03:24.251 --> 03:25.717
Quinn, what happened?

03:25.783 --> 03:29.251
I mean, what actually happened between you and David?

03:29.317 --> 03:32.251
He just changed, you know?

03:32.317 --> 03:37.950
I mean, he used to see the world exactly the way I saw it.

03:38.017 --> 03:39.984
He just doesn't anymore.

03:40.050 --> 03:42.417
But he still loves you.

03:43.618 --> 03:46.317
I know.

03:46.384 --> 03:48.817
But I don't know if that's enough.

03:50.817 --> 03:51.850
I'm sorry. I got to go.

03:51.917 --> 03:53.184
I got to go down to the studio

03:53.251 --> 03:55.217
and take care of this whole "shutting us down" mess.

03:55.284 --> 03:57.451
Do you need my help?
No.

03:57.518 --> 03:59.317
You just stay here and enjoy your day.

03:59.384 --> 04:00.551
I'll see you later.

04:00.618 --> 04:02.584
Okay.

04:02.650 --> 04:04.584
It's gonna be okay, Quinn.

04:04.650 --> 04:06.251
I love you.

04:06.317 --> 04:08.017
I love you, too.

04:08.084 --> 04:11.618
*keep your hello*

04:11.683 --> 04:16.351
*don't think about it at all*

04:16.416 --> 04:18.451
Is it okay?

04:18.517 --> 04:20.151
You're good.

04:20.216 --> 04:21.517
Damn it, Skills!

04:21.584 --> 04:23.384
What up, Millie?

04:23.451 --> 04:26.317
You and Marvin need to stop
this ridiculous naked standoff!

04:26.384 --> 04:28.084
Hey, look, he started it, trying to get me to move out.

04:28.151 --> 04:30.518
Okay, look...

04:30.584 --> 04:32.417
I'm going to pick up Alex DuprÃ© from the airport.

04:32.484 --> 04:34.618
I'm gonna work a full day, and when I get home,

04:34.683 --> 04:36.817
you two idiots better have your pants on!

04:39.317 --> 04:42.317
So, what are you gonna do?

04:42.384 --> 04:44.384
I ain't moving out. That's for sure.
Why not?

04:44.451 --> 04:46.518
If Chester hopped around without his fur on,

04:46.584 --> 04:47.750
I'd probably move out.

04:47.817 --> 04:49.783
Yeah, well, it's a long story.

04:49.850 --> 04:51.683
So, you ready for the beach?

04:51.750 --> 04:53.184
Totally.

04:53.251 --> 04:54.950
You think I can bury you
and Miss Lauren in the sand?

04:55.017 --> 04:56.451
Cool with me.

04:56.518 --> 04:57.984
Oh, and, um, don't tell Miss Lauren

04:58.050 --> 04:59.717
about the whole moving-out stuff, all right?

04:59.783 --> 05:00.984
Why not?

05:01.050 --> 05:02.884
Just don't. Wait. Uh-Oh, here she comes.

05:02.950 --> 05:04.117
Hey, boys.

05:04.184 --> 05:07.151
Ready for the beach?

05:11.050 --> 05:12.650
What are you guys up to?

05:12.717 --> 05:13.451
Nothing.
Nothing.

05:13.518 --> 05:15.351
Huh.

05:15.417 --> 05:17.618
*that girl's a genius*

05:17.683 --> 05:19.551
*whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh*

05:20.950 --> 05:24.117
Never believe that you can deceive.

05:24.184 --> 05:27.050
You might think that you can get away with it.

05:27.117 --> 05:29.650
You might actually get away with it...

05:29.717 --> 05:31.384
for a while.

05:31.451 --> 05:35.251
But your life is made up of choices and decisions.

05:38.151 --> 05:39.584
Hi, Julian.

05:39.650 --> 05:42.151
Dad.

05:42.217 --> 05:44.184
What are you doing here?

05:44.251 --> 05:47.251
I came to talk you out of the worst decision of your life.

05:47.317 --> 05:51.618
Poor choices, poor life.

05:51.683 --> 05:54.484
Bad decisions...

05:54.551 --> 05:57.317
bad life.

05:57.384 --> 06:01.050
Come on. Where is it?

06:01.117 --> 06:03.783
Page 17, item 4...

06:03.850 --> 06:05.850
It's the part of the contract that basically says

06:05.917 --> 06:08.650
we can acquire the label whenever we'd like.

06:08.717 --> 06:09.950
Wickedness...

06:10.017 --> 06:12.950
As you know, I've been there.

06:13.017 --> 06:14.783
I'm not alone.

06:14.850 --> 06:17.351
My wife was, too.

06:17.417 --> 06:20.351
She was deceptive and manipulative.

06:20.417 --> 06:22.584
She abused drink and drugs.

06:22.650 --> 06:25.351
She was promiscuous.

06:25.417 --> 06:28.850
But today she stands beside me a changed woman,

06:28.917 --> 06:32.650
a caring woman, a better woman.

06:32.717 --> 06:35.717
Ladies and gentlemen, my wife and the love of my life.

06:46.950 --> 06:49.484
*my girl's ready to take control*

06:49.551 --> 06:52.817
*she just blows my mind*

06:52.884 --> 06:54.683
*she only listens to the radio*

06:54.750 --> 06:56.551
I love you, honey.

06:56.618 --> 06:58.817
I love you, honey.

06:58.884 --> 07:01.750
*yeah* !

07:01.817 --> 07:05.151
*she wakes up scared of getting old*

07:12.317 --> 07:15.084
I didn't make a bad decision, dad.

07:15.151 --> 07:17.484
Is that right?

07:17.551 --> 07:20.251
You walked away from a potential blockbuster movie

07:20.317 --> 07:23.251
days before production, and for what?

07:23.317 --> 07:25.284
For love.

07:25.351 --> 07:26.683
Love...

07:26.750 --> 07:28.184
with Brooke Davis.

07:28.251 --> 07:29.817
Be careful, dad.

07:29.884 --> 07:32.384
Julian, she's Brooke Davis!

07:32.451 --> 07:33.584
I read the tabloids.

07:33.650 --> 07:35.117
This is a fling for her,

07:35.184 --> 07:37.351
and it could cost you your career!

07:37.417 --> 07:39.618
I think you need to leave.

07:41.351 --> 07:44.417
*behind the tv screen I've fallen to my knees*

07:44.484 --> 07:49.251
Your career was one movie away
from being prestigious...

07:49.317 --> 07:51.618
This movie.

07:51.683 --> 07:53.618
And you walk away.

07:53.683 --> 07:57.650
For what? A promiscuous fashion designer.

07:59.850 --> 08:01.850
*I need to get away*

08:01.917 --> 08:03.950
*blanket of silence*

08:04.017 --> 08:06.683
*makes me want to sink my teeth in deep*

08:06.750 --> 08:08.017
*burn all the evidence*

08:08.084 --> 08:10.050
Oh, this glass is gonna look amazing

08:10.117 --> 08:11.351
in my loft in Los Angeles.

08:11.417 --> 08:12.917
All right, Miranda,

08:12.984 --> 08:15.451
I know that you have a legal
right to shut down the label,

08:15.518 --> 08:17.917
but you don't have to be a total bitch about it.

08:17.984 --> 08:19.551
You're the producer, Haley,

08:19.618 --> 08:21.351
and, potentially, a great artist,

08:21.417 --> 08:22.850
but you don't have time to record

08:22.917 --> 08:26.084
because you're running what is essentially a vanity label.

08:26.151 --> 08:27.284
Va...  vanity la...

08:27.351 --> 08:28.950
You guys would not have

08:29.017 --> 08:31.584
Mia Catalano if it wasn't for this label.

08:31.650 --> 08:34.217
You wouldn't have had the time or patience or interest

08:34.284 --> 08:36.750
to develop an artist like her.

08:36.817 --> 08:38.717
That's what small labels do.

08:38.783 --> 08:40.284
We develop and nurture artists.

08:40.351 --> 08:42.284
It's something corporate labels will never do.

08:47.251 --> 08:49.050
I've always wanted a pool table.

08:52.484 --> 08:54.650
I can't believe your dad just came all this way

08:54.717 --> 08:56.783
to tell you he thinks you're making a mistake.

08:56.850 --> 09:00.451
He couldn't call or text or tweet that to you?

09:00.518 --> 09:03.518
He's a movie producer, Brooke. He loves the dramatic.

09:03.584 --> 09:05.251
Well, what else did he say?

09:05.317 --> 09:07.284
He wanted to know what my game plan was...

09:07.351 --> 09:08.817
was I still actively producing,

09:08.884 --> 09:10.084
do I have a development staff

09:10.151 --> 09:11.384
finding me new properties, and...

09:11.451 --> 09:12.884
That is some poster.

09:12.950 --> 09:14.551
What? Oh, right. You like it?

09:14.618 --> 09:15.783
Yeah.

09:15.850 --> 09:18.251
It's... different for the living room.

09:18.317 --> 09:20.151
He was just so crazy, my father.

09:20.217 --> 09:22.551
Do you think maybe you would like that better

09:22.618 --> 09:24.050
in the spare bedroom

09:24.117 --> 09:25.551
or in your office?

09:25.618 --> 09:27.683
We could get you an office for that.

09:27.750 --> 09:29.151
Look, my dad just flew five hours

09:29.217 --> 09:31.251
to ask me if I'm quitting the
business and getting married.

09:31.317 --> 09:32.884
What did you say?

09:32.950 --> 09:34.650
I asked him to leave.

09:34.717 --> 09:38.184
No, about the "marriage" part.

09:38.251 --> 09:40.384
I told him he was crazy.
We're not getting married.

09:40.451 --> 09:41.650
We just moved in together.

09:43.518 --> 09:45.484
I... I don't... I don't know what the hell got into him.

09:45.551 --> 09:47.850
*I ain't got no other place to hide*

09:47.917 --> 09:49.917
*chained down like a sitting duck*

09:49.984 --> 09:52.750
*just waiting for the fall*

09:52.817 --> 09:54.151
Hey, you.

09:55.650 --> 09:58.117
The clock... it was a good idea.

09:58.184 --> 10:01.817
I think it reminds people
that every second counts.

10:01.884 --> 10:03.451
It's easy.

10:03.518 --> 10:06.184
People don't have to work that hard to get it.

10:06.251 --> 10:08.084
We have that dinner tonight

10:08.151 --> 10:10.683
with the investment guys from Texas.

10:10.750 --> 10:12.217
I think you should tell them

10:12.284 --> 10:15.717
the whole "phoenix rising from the ashes" story.

10:15.783 --> 10:16.884
They'll love it.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.884
It was a good show today.

10:18.950 --> 10:21.284
I think we might have reached some people.

10:21.351 --> 10:23.484
Do you think it was a good show?

10:23.551 --> 10:26.683
I'll let you know after I see the ratings.

10:26.750 --> 10:27.850
I got to go.

10:29.284 --> 10:30.618
Hey.

10:32.351 --> 10:34.217
I love you.

10:34.284 --> 10:37.151
I know, baby.

10:37.217 --> 10:38.783
Wear your gray suit tonight.

10:38.850 --> 10:40.717
You always look good in that suit.

10:48.351 --> 10:51.084
Guys.

10:51.151 --> 10:54.417
Right here!
Right here!

10:56.151 --> 10:57.817
Hey. There you go.

10:57.884 --> 10:59.251
One more.

10:59.317 --> 11:00.551
Miss DuprÃ©? Miss duprÃ©?

11:00.618 --> 11:02.251
Could I get an autograph?

11:02.317 --> 11:03.618
Oh, yeah, sure, you pretty thing.

11:03.683 --> 11:04.650
What's your name?

11:04.717 --> 11:05.551
Tanya.

11:05.618 --> 11:06.917
Tanya?

11:06.984 --> 11:08.184
I loved you in "Heart so true".

11:08.251 --> 11:09.484
You were so brave in that.

11:09.551 --> 11:11.650
Oh, thank you, sweetie.

11:11.717 --> 11:13.683
But that's just acting. You're the brave one.

11:13.750 --> 11:14.683
Thanks.

11:14.750 --> 11:16.618
Bye. Bye bye.

11:16.683 --> 11:18.650
Alex, Millicent Huxtable, Clothes Over Bros.

11:18.717 --> 11:19.750
Welcome to Tree Hill.

11:19.817 --> 11:21.683
Thank you.

11:24.551 --> 11:27.717
Can I just say that I am your biggest fan?

11:27.783 --> 11:29.451
And it's because of things like that...

11:29.518 --> 11:30.884
that you would take the time

11:30.950 --> 11:32.484
to inspire that poor girl in the wheelchair

11:32.551 --> 11:33.783
after such a long flight.

11:33.850 --> 11:35.518
They kind of creep me out.

11:35.584 --> 11:37.384
What? Cripples and, like, retarded people.

11:37.451 --> 11:39.717
They're always, like, drooling and smiling really weird.

11:39.783 --> 11:40.750
It's so gross.

11:40.817 --> 11:43.518
Water, water, water.

11:43.584 --> 11:45.618
Um, is there any wine in here?

11:45.683 --> 11:48.783
Um, I thought you were sober.
You just went to rehab.

11:48.850 --> 11:50.217
Ugh, do not remind me.

11:50.284 --> 11:51.417
They took my phone away.

11:51.484 --> 11:52.783
Besides, wine's not even alcohol.

11:52.850 --> 11:53.817
It's like grape.

11:53.884 --> 11:56.351
Ugh, it's so hot out there.

11:56.417 --> 11:57.750
Where the hell are we?

11:57.817 --> 12:00.117
It's like the devil's ass in this place.

12:00.184 --> 12:02.017
When do I get paid?

12:02.084 --> 12:04.217
I think your agent takes care of that.

12:04.284 --> 12:05.917
Can I just tell you... I hate that woman.

12:05.984 --> 12:07.551
She's like a complete alcoholic,

12:07.618 --> 12:09.551
and her fingers look like chicken feet.

12:09.618 --> 12:12.683
Btw, I am starving. Is there any food?

12:12.750 --> 12:14.817
Well, I read that you only eat organic food,

12:14.884 --> 12:17.451
so we have an entire organic feast waiting at the hotel.

12:17.518 --> 12:19.317
Yeah, I just make that stuff up.

12:19.384 --> 12:21.817
Can you drive through a Mickey d's?

12:21.884 --> 12:23.484
I could totally eat the butt off a skunk right now.

12:23.551 --> 12:26.317
Um, drive on...

12:26.384 --> 12:27.950
please.

12:28.017 --> 12:29.551
Nate, it's gonna be okay.

12:29.618 --> 12:31.184
You know, we haven't heard from this woman

12:31.251 --> 12:32.650
since the one e-mail.

12:32.717 --> 12:35.284
So, until it's real, it's not real.

12:35.351 --> 12:36.817
You know, and besides,

12:36.884 --> 12:38.584
who the hell would want
to sleep with you, anyway?

12:40.151 --> 12:42.017
Okay, I know it's bad timing,

12:42.084 --> 12:43.384
but damn.

12:43.451 --> 12:45.650
Dude, quit checking out my sister-in-law.

12:45.717 --> 12:46.950
Hey, dumb and dumber.

12:47.017 --> 12:48.184
Hey.

12:49.618 --> 12:50.717
Nice day, huh?

12:55.017 --> 12:57.984
I don't know. Maybe you're right.

12:58.050 --> 12:59.618
Maybe it's nothing.

13:02.251 --> 13:04.518
Actually, uh...

13:04.584 --> 13:06.017
now it is something.

13:19.784 --> 13:21.084
My hat!

13:21.150 --> 13:22.651
I'll get it.

13:22.717 --> 13:23.884
Ohh.

13:23.951 --> 13:25.183
Can you move?

13:25.250 --> 13:26.817
Not a muscle.
Me neither.

13:28.051 --> 13:30.717
Man, I hope that knucklehead come back.

13:30.784 --> 13:32.917
So, listen, Peyton, here's the thing...

13:32.984 --> 13:35.317
Uh, you know how I...

13:35.384 --> 13:38.651
insisted that you keep that 1% of the label?

13:38.717 --> 13:41.951
Well, it... it kind of killed the label.

13:45.283 --> 13:47.951
But, Haley...
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

13:48.018 --> 13:49.851
I can see that I'm upsetting you,

13:49.917 --> 13:51.283
and I don't want to do that.

13:51.350 --> 13:55.550
So, um, let me just, uh...

13:55.617 --> 13:57.217
Talk to Lucas.

14:00.051 --> 14:02.217
Geez, Haley,

14:02.283 --> 14:04.717
I... I... I... I... I don't know, you know?

14:04.784 --> 14:08.150
This has really meant a lot to... peyton.

14:08.217 --> 14:09.484
I know. I know.

14:09.550 --> 14:10.784
I'm a terrible friend,

14:10.851 --> 14:12.183
and there's nothing that I can do unless I...

14:15.784 --> 14:18.018
You might be a genius, Haley.

14:18.084 --> 14:20.118
Thank you, Haley.

14:21.450 --> 14:24.250
* am I *

14:24.317 --> 14:26.717
* am I losing my mind? *

14:28.217 --> 14:29.384
Jamie?

14:29.450 --> 14:30.350
Aunt Quinn!

14:30.417 --> 14:31.484
Hey!

14:31.550 --> 14:33.217
Who let you off your leash?

14:33.283 --> 14:35.283
Uncle Skills, but he didn't bring the leash today.

14:35.350 --> 14:36.450
Okay, where is he?

14:36.517 --> 14:38.350
He's over there. Miss Lauren, too.

14:38.417 --> 14:40.350
This is her hat. Cool.

14:40.417 --> 14:42.217
Well, I was just on my way to go get a snack.

14:42.283 --> 14:43.550
Can I tempt you?
Sure.

14:43.617 --> 14:45.250
Yeah? You should probably tell them you're with me.

14:45.317 --> 14:47.851
Denzel, this is Macaulay. Denzel, this is Macaulay.

14:47.917 --> 14:50.084
I'm going for a snack with my aunt Quinn. Over.

14:52.018 --> 14:55.217
Okay, all set. Stupid, crazy nanny.

14:55.283 --> 14:57.350
Hop on.

14:57.417 --> 14:58.651
Whoop! There we go.

14:58.717 --> 14:59.851
What do you want?

14:59.917 --> 15:02.584
Hey, give me a sec, okay?

15:02.651 --> 15:03.751
Okay.

15:16.084 --> 15:18.350
Mind if I join you?

15:18.417 --> 15:20.584
Spare a few bucks?

15:22.584 --> 15:25.917
First...

15:25.984 --> 15:28.584
you mind telling me how you got here?

15:28.651 --> 15:31.751
You must be one of them religious guys or something.

15:31.817 --> 15:33.450
No.

15:33.517 --> 15:35.084
I got nothing against religion.

15:36.417 --> 15:37.684
If you ask me,

15:37.751 --> 15:39.751
the one man you got to believe in...

15:39.817 --> 15:41.384
is you.

15:43.118 --> 15:45.817
I stopped believing in me a long time ago.

15:45.884 --> 15:47.817
Why?

15:47.884 --> 15:49.018
You made some mistakes?

15:49.084 --> 15:52.350
You failed sometimes?

15:53.917 --> 15:55.517
Listen.

15:55.584 --> 15:58.684
No matter what mistakes or failures you had,

15:58.751 --> 16:00.717
they weren't even close to mine.

16:03.584 --> 16:06.651
There's a book you should read.

16:06.717 --> 16:09.484
You talking about the bible.

16:09.550 --> 16:13.217
No, man, it's not the bible. It's this book.

16:16.350 --> 16:18.250
Listen.

16:18.317 --> 16:20.617
There's a used-book shop around the corner.

16:20.684 --> 16:24.617
Now, you can take this book, sell it for a few bucks,

16:24.684 --> 16:27.183
buy yourself a bottle,

16:27.250 --> 16:30.817
and feel good for a few minutes.

16:30.884 --> 16:33.584
Or you could read it

16:33.651 --> 16:36.051
and feel better for the rest of your life.

16:43.350 --> 16:45.217
Hey.

16:47.317 --> 16:49.651
What your name is, man?

16:49.717 --> 16:53.118
My name is Dan Scott.

16:53.183 --> 16:55.317
And I believe in you.

17:09.084 --> 17:10.349
He probably didn't mean it.

17:10.416 --> 17:12.018
It was just the way he said it,

17:12.084 --> 17:14.751
as if the very idea of us ever getting married

17:14.817 --> 17:16.951
was somehow completely ridiculous to him.

17:17.018 --> 17:20.282
And then he hung this ugly army-man poster

17:20.349 --> 17:21.784
in the living room.

17:21.851 --> 17:23.517
I have to talk to him.

17:23.584 --> 17:25.084
Okay, but he might freak out a little

17:25.150 --> 17:26.651
if you start talking marriage so soon.

17:26.717 --> 17:30.150
No, about the poster, you dork. It has to go.

17:31.450 --> 17:33.651
I am really excited to meet Alex, though.

17:33.717 --> 17:34.851
How is she?

17:34.917 --> 17:37.350
Um...

17:37.417 --> 17:40.350
she's really... something.

17:40.417 --> 17:41.784
She just wanted to freshen up.

17:41.851 --> 17:43.118
You're gonna love her.

17:44.784 --> 17:46.217
She's gonna hate you!

17:46.283 --> 17:47.484
Go away, you witch.

17:47.550 --> 17:49.784
"Witch"? "Witch"?!

17:49.851 --> 17:51.417
Look, missy,

17:51.484 --> 17:53.084
my ass is on the line here!

17:53.150 --> 17:54.417
You mean your big ass.

17:54.484 --> 17:56.617
Really? Really? Get up!

17:56.684 --> 17:57.884
I'm tired!

17:57.951 --> 17:59.450
Well, you better get un-tired

17:59.517 --> 18:00.917
because you're going over to Clothes Over Bros,

18:00.984 --> 18:02.751
and you're gonna convince Brooke Davis

18:02.817 --> 18:04.817
that the half-million dollars she's
paying you is not a waste!

18:06.018 --> 18:09.250
Half a million dollars?

18:19.584 --> 18:22.784
So, you want to talk?

18:22.851 --> 18:24.118
Talk.

18:24.183 --> 18:27.450
What, no "hello"? No introductions?

18:27.517 --> 18:28.684
Your name's Renee.

18:28.751 --> 18:30.584
I recognize you from the picture you took

18:30.651 --> 18:33.051
when you trespassed at a 7-Year-Old's birthday party.

18:33.118 --> 18:34.384
You have a last name?

18:34.450 --> 18:37.051
You're kind of hot when you're all fired up.

18:37.118 --> 18:39.784
I know he didn't do it.

18:39.851 --> 18:41.350
I don't know what your angle is,

18:41.417 --> 18:43.283
and I don't know why you targeted Nathan Scott,

18:43.350 --> 18:45.550
but what I do know is that he didn't do it.

18:47.517 --> 18:50.717
You're quite the party boy, aren't you?

18:50.784 --> 18:53.717
I'm single.
He's not.

18:53.784 --> 18:55.317
Oh, like that matters.

18:55.384 --> 18:59.651
Maybe not to girls like you, but to Nathan it does.

18:59.717 --> 19:03.617
"Girls like me."

19:03.684 --> 19:06.517
You know what's so great about justice?

19:06.584 --> 19:09.550
It doesn't discriminate against "girls like me."

19:09.617 --> 19:10.917
What do you want from me?

19:10.984 --> 19:12.851
Whoa, walk away, Nate.

19:12.917 --> 19:15.051
Huh? Hi, Nathan. You need to stop this.

19:15.118 --> 19:17.018
Outside. You need to stop this now, okay?

19:17.084 --> 19:18.283
Do you hear me?

19:18.350 --> 19:20.183
Why are you doing this to me?

19:20.250 --> 19:21.217
Come on.

19:35.884 --> 19:37.984
What the hell is wrong with you?

19:38.051 --> 19:39.751
I just wanted to talk to her.

19:39.817 --> 19:41.051
In public?

19:41.118 --> 19:42.217
In front of a roomful of people

19:42.283 --> 19:43.283
with camera phones and video,

19:43.350 --> 19:44.450
you wanted to talk with her,

19:44.517 --> 19:45.484
just thought you'd have a little chat?

19:45.550 --> 19:46.984
I'm sorry. I screwed up.

19:47.051 --> 19:49.084
Yeah, you screwed up, Nate!

19:53.384 --> 19:54.984
What does she want?

19:55.051 --> 19:56.250
I don't know.

19:56.317 --> 19:57.817
I was about to find out

19:57.884 --> 20:00.584
until Nathan Scott stormed in like a madman!

20:00.651 --> 20:02.217
Look, I said I was sorry, jackass.

20:02.283 --> 20:03.250
Let it go.

20:08.651 --> 20:10.717
I'm gonna see if she'll sit down with me again.

20:10.784 --> 20:15.517
In the meantime, you just, um...

20:15.584 --> 20:18.651
Try not to get thrown through a window, all right?

20:19.851 --> 20:22.317
Damn it, nate.

20:29.717 --> 20:30.984
Brooke?

20:31.051 --> 20:32.550
Please don't fire me. Please don't fire me.

20:32.617 --> 20:35.884
Shut up. I'm an actress. I got this.

20:35.951 --> 20:39.118
Alex, hi, I'm Brooke Davis.
It's so nice to meet you.

20:39.183 --> 20:41.484
Oh... my... God.

20:41.550 --> 20:43.317
You are so beautiful.

20:43.384 --> 20:45.183
Thank you.

20:45.250 --> 20:47.717
Can I just say that I'm so happy to be here?

20:47.784 --> 20:49.617
And I think it's so great

20:49.684 --> 20:52.183
that you make designer clothes for plus-sized girls.

20:52.250 --> 20:54.283
I never knew it was based on you,

20:54.350 --> 20:56.250
but I think that's so sweet.

20:56.317 --> 20:58.917
Uh, no, I'm normal-sized.

20:58.984 --> 21:01.584
Oh, I know, but I have the best diet for you.

21:01.651 --> 21:04.018
You're so gonna lose that weight.

21:04.084 --> 21:06.183
Okay. How was your flight?

21:06.250 --> 21:08.051
You flew private, right?

21:08.118 --> 21:09.250
Uh-Huh.

21:09.317 --> 21:10.484
They let me ride in the cockpit.

21:10.550 --> 21:11.717
It was so rad.

21:11.784 --> 21:13.283
In the cockpit?
Totally.

21:13.350 --> 21:15.384
They let me steer the plane and everything.

21:15.450 --> 21:17.417
They let you fly the plane.

21:17.484 --> 21:19.717
I know! I'm so a cockpit girl.

21:19.784 --> 21:21.018
That's what she said.

21:21.084 --> 21:23.118
Who?
Who what?

21:23.183 --> 21:24.617
You... you said she said something,

21:24.684 --> 21:25.951
but I don't know who you mean.

21:26.018 --> 21:28.250
No, it's... it's an expression.

21:28.317 --> 21:31.450
When someone says something that sounds sexual,

21:31.517 --> 21:34.283
you say, "that's what she said".

21:34.350 --> 21:36.984
Oh. Right.

21:37.051 --> 21:39.118
Okay.

21:39.183 --> 21:40.617
Why don't we show Alex the new line?

21:40.684 --> 21:42.484
Great. You're gonna love it.

21:42.550 --> 21:45.817
It's kind of elegant and kind of edgy,

21:45.884 --> 21:48.384
and the pieces are a lot like this one.

21:48.450 --> 21:50.550
No, I don't like that.

21:50.617 --> 21:51.784
Why?

21:51.851 --> 21:53.183
Uh, first of all, it's purple.

21:53.250 --> 21:54.417
When I was a little girl,

21:54.484 --> 21:55.917
there was this dinosaur thing,

21:55.984 --> 21:57.984
and it totally freaked me out, and it was purple.

21:58.051 --> 21:59.984
You mean Barney?

22:00.051 --> 22:02.283
Yeah. That's what she said.

22:02.350 --> 22:03.717
Okay.

22:03.784 --> 22:06.018
That's totally wrong, but...

22:06.084 --> 22:07.951
I know. I'm so funny, huh?

22:08.018 --> 22:09.217
My best friend, Kimmy, told me

22:09.283 --> 22:10.450
I should totally do more comedy.

22:10.517 --> 22:12.450
She says most people are really uptight,

22:12.517 --> 22:14.118
but I'm not tight at all.

22:14.183 --> 22:15.217
That's what she said.

22:15.283 --> 22:16.884
Who? Oh, Kimmy?

22:16.951 --> 22:18.384
Yeah, she said that.

22:18.450 --> 22:21.051
She said I'm so much funnier than Cameron Diaz.

22:21.118 --> 22:23.118
I mean, plus, have you seen my ass?

22:24.217 --> 22:25.517
Come on.

22:25.584 --> 22:28.517
Way better than hers.

22:28.584 --> 22:31.417
Like way.

22:31.484 --> 22:34.417
Could you excuse us for just...

22:34.484 --> 22:35.584
One minute?

22:35.651 --> 22:38.051
Sure. I have to pee, anyway.

22:38.118 --> 22:40.018
Great. Second door on the left.

22:40.084 --> 22:41.751
Okay.

22:43.317 --> 22:46.584
I'll just clean out my things and go.

22:50.183 --> 22:53.084
Remember that time I stayed with you and uncle David

22:53.150 --> 22:54.283
for a whole week?

22:54.350 --> 22:56.150
Yep, and we made pancakes every morning

22:56.217 --> 22:58.051
with chocolate sauce and whipped cream?

22:58.118 --> 23:01.283
Maybe if David comes, we could do that again.

23:02.417 --> 23:03.450
Yeah.

23:03.517 --> 23:05.051
Maybe.

23:06.751 --> 23:08.817
Hey, are you sure Skills and lauren

23:08.884 --> 23:09.884
won't be worried about you?

23:09.951 --> 23:11.717
Oh, man!

23:17.984 --> 23:20.417
At least I got your hat.

23:36.051 --> 23:37.884
So, can I talk to you?

23:37.951 --> 23:41.018
Would you like to speak with me or talk to me?

23:41.084 --> 23:43.851
Oh, brother, you are a piece of work.

23:43.917 --> 23:45.951
So, you're excited about my record, right?

23:46.018 --> 23:47.484
John Knight's excited about my record,

23:47.550 --> 23:49.250
which is why you guys want to close Red Bedroom...

23:49.317 --> 23:50.384
to free me up to record?

23:50.450 --> 23:52.283
In part, yes.

23:52.350 --> 23:55.751
If you close Red Bedroom, I'm not gonna make an album.

23:57.317 --> 23:59.118
Haley, you need to remove the emotion from this.

23:59.183 --> 24:01.150
It's a business decision. It's not personal.

24:01.217 --> 24:02.517
It is personal.

24:02.584 --> 24:06.517
Everything about this label is personal...

24:06.584 --> 24:09.250
why Peyton started it, why she made me her partner...

24:09.317 --> 24:11.350
It's as personal as it gets.

24:13.317 --> 24:17.417
If you don't record with us, you don't record at all.

24:17.484 --> 24:19.651
We have a contract with you.

24:19.717 --> 24:21.751
We own you.

24:21.817 --> 24:24.951
But you don't own me.

24:34.717 --> 24:35.217
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mia.

24:36.250 --> 24:37.450
I've seen you perform a few times,

24:37.517 --> 24:39.584
but we've never been formally introduced.

24:39.651 --> 24:41.651
Miranda Stone.

24:41.717 --> 24:44.450
Haley's told me a lot about you.

24:44.517 --> 24:47.884
Red Bedroom records will always be important to us,

24:47.951 --> 24:49.484
but at the moment...

24:49.550 --> 24:50.484
can we just cut to the chase?

24:50.550 --> 24:52.217
How is Chase?
He's good.

24:52.283 --> 24:53.951
He says hi.
Thanks.

24:54.018 --> 24:55.183
Aww, I was there at your first date.

24:55.250 --> 24:56.684
Oh, I know. You and Nathan were so great.

24:58.651 --> 25:00.350
I sold more records

25:00.417 --> 25:02.817
than any artist on our roster last year.

25:02.884 --> 25:05.051
But if this label goes away, so do I.

25:05.118 --> 25:06.450
How so?

25:06.517 --> 25:07.684
You distribute my records,

25:07.751 --> 25:10.283
but I record for Red Bedroom, exclusively.

25:10.350 --> 25:11.784
Peyton made sure of that.

25:11.851 --> 25:12.984
It's true. I checked.

25:13.051 --> 25:15.817
Wow. Everyone has their price.

25:15.884 --> 25:17.684
No, actually, not everyone.

25:17.751 --> 25:19.584
Peyton and Haley are responsible for my career,

25:19.651 --> 25:21.051
and you can't put a price on that.

25:21.118 --> 25:22.817
And even if you do, I won't accept it.

25:22.884 --> 25:24.884
So, congratulations.

25:24.951 --> 25:26.550
You're about to lose your biggest-selling artist.

25:26.617 --> 25:28.018
Does that pretty much do it, Hales?

25:28.084 --> 25:29.584
Yes. Thank you. So good to see you.

25:29.651 --> 25:30.851
Oh, good to see you, too.

25:30.917 --> 25:32.917
You look so cute. Thanks.

25:32.984 --> 25:35.784
I'll let you two talk. Yeah?

25:38.684 --> 25:41.784
Who's the bitch now, bitch?

25:43.651 --> 25:44.751
I'm so sorry.

25:44.817 --> 25:46.051
I should have met with her first.

25:46.118 --> 25:48.550
I thought she was the girl from her movies.

25:48.617 --> 25:50.018
It's okay. I thought so, too.

25:50.084 --> 25:52.018
She has been in that bathroom a really long time.

25:52.084 --> 25:53.817
What are we gonna do?

25:53.884 --> 25:55.384
I'll tell you what we're not gonna do.

25:55.450 --> 25:58.183
We are not gonna pay that dum-dum $500,000.

25:58.250 --> 26:00.450
We'll just have to... tell her something.

26:00.517 --> 26:05.517
We'll say the company went bankrupt or...

26:05.584 --> 26:07.617
Or maybe...

26:07.684 --> 26:09.550
we should just start speaking Spanish

26:09.617 --> 26:12.317
and she'll get really confused and she'll just leave.

26:12.384 --> 26:14.717
I don't think that's gonna work.

26:14.784 --> 26:17.084
It might. She is really dumb.

26:17.150 --> 26:18.617
Brooke?

26:20.183 --> 26:23.517
Buenos dias. Tenido mucha cerveza.

26:23.584 --> 26:26.150
Ay, mucha cerveza.

26:26.217 --> 26:28.817
It's okay.

26:28.884 --> 26:32.118
I, uh... I know I'm not what you expected.

26:32.183 --> 26:34.550
You don't have to pay me.

26:34.617 --> 26:37.051
It's just...

26:40.384 --> 26:42.317
that's one of my designs.

26:42.384 --> 26:45.917
Since rehab, this dress is all I have.

26:45.984 --> 26:49.584
When I felt like I was nothing,

26:49.651 --> 26:53.350
it gave me strength and dignity.

26:53.417 --> 26:56.350
So, no matter what happens to me

26:56.417 --> 26:59.183
or where my life takes me,

26:59.250 --> 27:01.217
I'll wear this dress...

27:01.283 --> 27:03.717
your dress...

27:03.784 --> 27:05.917
and I'll be fine.

27:12.150 --> 27:15.283
It's okay. Of course we will pay you.

27:15.350 --> 27:20.217
I... I think you look beautiful in that dress,

27:20.283 --> 27:22.617
and I think you're gonna be perfect

27:22.684 --> 27:24.283
as the face of the line.

27:24.350 --> 27:26.217
Really?

27:27.884 --> 27:30.684
That is so rad!

27:30.751 --> 27:31.417
Oh!

27:31.484 --> 27:34.317
Yay!

27:36.484 --> 27:38.317
Hey.

27:38.384 --> 27:40.051
Look at this.

27:40.118 --> 27:42.150
It's all over the internet.

27:42.217 --> 27:44.717
The buzz is really positive.

27:44.784 --> 27:47.951
I didn't really have "buzz" in mind.

27:48.018 --> 27:50.584
I know, but that's why you have me.

27:52.584 --> 27:55.851
*I'm here if you need me*

27:55.917 --> 28:00.217
*oh, this way* ...

28:00.283 --> 28:01.817
Well, hi.

28:01.884 --> 28:04.584
What are you doing?

28:04.651 --> 28:06.317
Fixing you dinner,

28:06.384 --> 28:08.917
and thinking about getting rid of my poster.

28:08.984 --> 28:10.384
Why?

28:10.450 --> 28:13.684
Because you have to eat and because...

28:13.751 --> 28:14.851
You hate it.

28:14.917 --> 28:16.118
I don't hate it.

28:16.183 --> 28:17.984
Yeah.

28:18.051 --> 28:20.751
No, I don't. I just...

28:20.817 --> 28:23.884
I don't really like it there.

28:23.951 --> 28:25.717
It's okay.

28:34.617 --> 28:37.617
My father, as you know, was always gone,

28:37.684 --> 28:41.084
always on some distant location or at the office,

28:41.150 --> 28:43.018
you know, making movies.

28:43.084 --> 28:47.617
But this one time, he came home and surprised me

28:47.684 --> 28:51.517
and took me to see "the thin red line".

28:51.584 --> 28:54.984
And then we spent the rest of the day together,

28:55.051 --> 28:56.984
just him and me.

29:00.118 --> 29:03.384
And that didn't happen very often.

29:03.450 --> 29:06.217
Actually, that really never happened again.

29:08.917 --> 29:11.118
But that day...

29:12.651 --> 29:14.751
that was a good day.

29:16.384 --> 29:19.550
That was probably the best day I ever had with him.

29:23.018 --> 29:27.450
And that was the day I decided
I wanted to make movies, too,

29:27.517 --> 29:30.317
like my dad.

29:30.384 --> 29:37.651
*let it disappear into my hand*

29:37.717 --> 29:42.084
*whoa, yeah, my hand*

29:42.150 --> 29:44.118
I appreciate you meeting me.

29:44.183 --> 29:46.250
Oh, so now you appreciate me.

29:46.317 --> 29:48.984
What happened to confrontational clay?

29:49.051 --> 29:51.917
I'm confrontational because
I'm protective over Nathan,

29:51.984 --> 29:53.684
and because, of all my clients,

29:53.751 --> 29:56.317
he's the last one I'd expect to be in this situation.

29:56.384 --> 29:58.851
And what situation is that?

29:58.917 --> 30:00.951
You tell me.

30:02.784 --> 30:04.884
Ask me what's in the envelope.

30:04.951 --> 30:06.450
I'm not here to play games.

30:07.984 --> 30:10.951
The night Nathan scored 35 points against Memphis,

30:11.018 --> 30:13.751
you threw a big party for him after the game.

30:13.817 --> 30:16.784
I should know. I was there.

30:16.851 --> 30:19.951
It got... pretty wild.

30:20.018 --> 30:22.951
Get to the point.

30:23.018 --> 30:27.584
The pictures of what happened
between me and Nathan that night

30:27.651 --> 30:29.684
are in the envelope.

30:29.751 --> 30:33.617
Whatever's in that envelope
is meaningless or fabricated,

30:33.684 --> 30:35.183
because we both know

30:35.250 --> 30:38.584
that whatever you're accusing
him of doing, he didn't do.

30:38.651 --> 30:41.051
Maybe you should take a look.

30:57.283 --> 30:58.984
I spoke with john knight.

30:59.051 --> 31:00.951
He thinks mia's bluffing,

31:01.017 --> 31:03.717
and he still wants to fold the label.

31:03.784 --> 31:07.383
But I recommended we don't.

31:09.617 --> 31:11.784
Why?

31:11.851 --> 31:15.383
Because integrity and loyalty still matter.

31:16.851 --> 31:20.617
Does that surprise you... that I actually have a heart?

31:20.684 --> 31:22.017
A little.

31:22.084 --> 31:24.151
And besides, I don't think she's bluffing,

31:24.218 --> 31:26.784
and she makes us a lot of money.

31:26.851 --> 31:28.650
If I do this... if...

31:28.717 --> 31:31.684
Your album needs to be finished in the next six months.

31:35.084 --> 31:37.051
Hmm.

31:37.118 --> 31:38.617
Why did Peyton start this label, anyway?

31:38.684 --> 31:39.617
You said it was personal.

31:43.450 --> 31:46.383
She thought that major labels were soulless.

31:46.450 --> 31:48.417
We are.

31:48.484 --> 31:50.650
Don't forget it.

31:50.717 --> 31:54.317
*we just don't see it the same way*

31:56.751 --> 31:59.550
*but you're never sure*

31:59.617 --> 32:04.151
*we can't go on like this anymore*

32:05.684 --> 32:07.484
It's open.

32:10.151 --> 32:12.151
Brooke.

32:12.218 --> 32:14.017
You wanted to speak with me?

32:16.051 --> 32:18.151
You know, my whole life,

32:18.218 --> 32:21.383
I wanted to get my mother to be proud of me.

32:21.450 --> 32:23.484
And then one night,

32:23.550 --> 32:26.917
Julian threatened to exile her from our lives,

32:26.984 --> 32:29.951
and I would do the same to you.

32:30.017 --> 32:32.184
I'm just not sure it would matter.

32:32.250 --> 32:34.917
You're upset.

32:34.984 --> 32:38.584
I have this poster hanging in my living room, Paul.

32:38.650 --> 32:40.584
Of course I'm upset.

32:40.650 --> 32:42.884
And the only reason that it's hanging there

32:42.951 --> 32:45.751
is because you took him to see that movie,

32:45.817 --> 32:48.184
and for one day

32:48.250 --> 32:51.350
that boy felt close to his father.

32:51.417 --> 32:55.218
He felt loved and appreciated.

32:55.283 --> 32:58.550
And the sad part is

32:58.617 --> 33:02.317
that there was only one of those days.

33:02.383 --> 33:04.084
Because in my book,

33:04.151 --> 33:09.118
the day that he didn't feel that
way should be the unique one.

33:09.184 --> 33:11.550
Fix it.

33:11.617 --> 33:15.884
*the hardest thing about this is I still care*

33:15.951 --> 33:18.118
*you know there's something better*

33:18.184 --> 33:22.584
*for both of us out there*

33:22.650 --> 33:23.884
Hey.

33:23.951 --> 33:26.151
Hey.

33:26.218 --> 33:29.317
' *cause you wait for rain*

33:30.584 --> 33:31.717
How'd it go at the label?

33:31.784 --> 33:33.584
Um...

33:33.650 --> 33:36.017
I think I fixed it temporarily.

33:37.784 --> 33:40.717
Now I got to fix my sister.

33:40.784 --> 33:43.084
Did you talk to David?

33:43.151 --> 33:45.917
There's not that much to talk about.

33:47.317 --> 33:48.784
We grew apart.

33:48.851 --> 33:51.218
You know, we stopped laughing as much,

33:51.283 --> 33:52.917
stopped caring as much.

33:54.884 --> 33:57.917
Did something happen recently?

33:57.984 --> 34:01.617
One night in New York I went
to go see "Spring awakening"

34:01.684 --> 34:02.984
with some friends.

34:03.051 --> 34:05.051
And after we took the subway

34:05.118 --> 34:08.217
to this ridiculous open-mike night in Brooklyn.

34:08.283 --> 34:10.751
And we watched these horrible performers

34:10.817 --> 34:12.484
who, for whatever reason,

34:12.550 --> 34:14.917
had to get onstage and be seen and heard.

34:17.382 --> 34:19.717
And as I'm watching them,

34:19.784 --> 34:22.350
I'm thinking that I understand them.

34:22.417 --> 34:26.083
You know, they... they were
messy and... and unsure

34:26.150 --> 34:29.817
and maybe a little confused, but...

34:29.884 --> 34:32.516
but they were doing what they needed to do,

34:32.583 --> 34:35.784
you know, what their hearts needed them to do.

34:37.717 --> 34:40.118
And then David called my cellphone,

34:40.184 --> 34:42.350
and I didn't want to answer.

34:42.417 --> 34:43.617
You know, there was a time

34:43.684 --> 34:45.283
when he would have been sitting right there,

34:45.350 --> 34:48.583
and... and I would have loved that.

34:48.650 --> 34:51.016
But he hasn't been that guy in a while.

34:51.083 --> 34:53.016
You guys were great together, you know.

34:53.083 --> 34:55.283
I mean, you... you were really happy.

34:55.350 --> 34:57.684
And then one day we weren't.

34:57.751 --> 34:59.350
And I know there's supposed to be

34:59.417 --> 35:02.984
some big, huge, important reason why, but there's not.

35:03.051 --> 35:04.650
It's just a feeling that I have

35:04.717 --> 35:07.884
that this isn't what I want
for the rest of my life.

35:07.951 --> 35:09.984
People have a right to change, Quinn.

35:10.051 --> 35:12.717
Yeah, but they also have a right to stay the same.

35:12.784 --> 35:14.984
They have a right to be exactly the person

35:15.051 --> 35:16.484
that they've always been.

35:16.550 --> 35:19.917
Okay? I didn't change, Haley. David changed.

35:19.984 --> 35:23.417
And now somehow I'm the one
who's broken because of it.

35:23.484 --> 35:25.051
*wait for rain*

35:25.118 --> 35:28.084
*and I chase the stars*

35:28.151 --> 35:29.550
*we just don't see* ...

35:29.617 --> 35:31.617
So, tell me what the worst act was

35:31.684 --> 35:33.517
that you saw that open-mike night.

35:35.184 --> 35:36.151
Come on.

35:38.617 --> 35:40.984
There was this really angry guy

35:41.051 --> 35:43.617
who sang "Cat's in the cradle".

35:43.684 --> 35:46.684
Yeah, I swear he was a serial killer.

35:48.584 --> 35:50.051
When he got done, everyone clapped,

35:50.118 --> 35:52.017
and he, like, sneered at the people who didn't.

35:53.317 --> 35:56.517
I guarantee you they're missing right now.

35:56.584 --> 36:00.151
*I chase the stars*

36:00.218 --> 36:02.884
I miss you, Haley-Bob.

36:02.951 --> 36:05.250
I miss you, too.

36:05.317 --> 36:08.917
*bring on the wrecking ball*

36:08.984 --> 36:11.051
You're not broken.

36:12.984 --> 36:15.383
Thanks.

36:15.450 --> 36:17.250
I hope not.

36:24.517 --> 36:26.151
Hi, son.

36:26.218 --> 36:28.417
I was just...

36:28.484 --> 36:30.717
heading back to L.A. and I wanted to...

36:30.784 --> 36:32.484
say goodbye.

36:32.550 --> 36:35.218
Okay.

36:35.283 --> 36:36.684
Listen...

36:36.751 --> 36:38.218
I came here to tell you

36:38.283 --> 36:40.817
that I think you're wrong
to put your relationship

36:40.884 --> 36:43.851
before your career, but...

36:45.784 --> 36:47.984
... I think it's me who's been wrong.

36:49.784 --> 36:52.317
I wasn't around enough.

36:52.383 --> 36:54.851
And...

36:54.917 --> 36:56.283
I was too busy

36:56.350 --> 36:59.084
caring for fictional characters

36:59.151 --> 37:02.984
instead of caring for the real ones in my life.

37:03.051 --> 37:05.017
You did fine, dad.

37:05.084 --> 37:11.250
*there's just too much, my, my*

37:11.317 --> 37:13.317
That poster...

37:16.084 --> 37:18.817
that was a good day for us?

37:18.884 --> 37:20.584
The best.

37:20.650 --> 37:26.051
*my heart's as cold as ice*

37:27.450 --> 37:29.450
I don't remember it.

37:31.317 --> 37:32.550
I'm sorry.

37:32.617 --> 37:34.550
It's okay.

37:34.617 --> 37:35.684
No, it's not.

37:38.650 --> 37:40.650
I'm proud of you, son.

37:43.017 --> 37:45.784
You go live your life and...

37:45.851 --> 37:47.617
Be happy.

37:49.550 --> 37:52.250
And whatever you do, don't be like me, okay?

37:54.717 --> 37:56.317
I'll see you.

37:58.751 --> 38:01.851
*the word that I breathe is a word that I need*

38:01.917 --> 38:05.417
*and the songs that I sing don't mean anything*

38:05.484 --> 38:07.184
*don't you wonder*

38:09.984 --> 38:14.751
*why it's always been this way* ?

38:17.151 --> 38:21.517
*all our innocence is gone*

38:21.584 --> 38:24.184
What'd she say?

38:24.250 --> 38:27.417
That night after your big game against Memphis,

38:27.484 --> 38:28.784
we had that party.

38:31.184 --> 38:34.650
We got pretty wasted that night.

38:34.717 --> 38:37.051
Yeah. So?

38:37.118 --> 38:40.317
Well, that was three months ago.

38:40.383 --> 38:45.350
*if you like, I'll take the blame*

38:48.118 --> 38:54.118
*for all the things that you have done*

38:54.184 --> 38:56.717
She's three months pregnant, nate.

38:56.784 --> 38:59.184
*my songs*

38:59.250 --> 39:03.417
*on a cold night*

39:03.484 --> 39:06.751
*I can't get you out* ...

39:06.817 --> 39:08.684
And where will you run...

39:08.751 --> 39:10.884
back to the life of a peasant harlot?

39:10.951 --> 39:12.684
Perhaps I will.

39:12.751 --> 39:15.051
But should I return to a life of more meager means,

39:15.118 --> 39:17.383
I will do so with my dignity intact...

39:17.450 --> 39:19.151
She's good in this. You were right.

39:19.218 --> 39:21.283
... my heart pure and true.

39:21.350 --> 39:22.417
What?

39:23.984 --> 39:26.817
I love you. You know that?

39:26.884 --> 39:29.584
I love who you are.

39:29.650 --> 39:33.383
I don't know how you got there, but I'm glad you did.

39:33.450 --> 39:36.851
I'm glad I did, too, 'cause you're here with me.

39:36.917 --> 39:39.684
Meager means, indeed.

39:39.751 --> 39:42.151
Mmm. Come here.

39:42.218 --> 39:43.951
Harlot!

39:45.317 --> 39:47.650
Leave the dress!

39:47.717 --> 39:49.751
This dress is all I have.

39:49.817 --> 39:52.151
When I felt like I was nothing,

39:52.218 --> 39:54.751
It gave me strength and dignity.

39:54.817 --> 39:56.450
So, no matter what happens to me

39:56.517 --> 39:58.650
Or where my life takes me,

39:58.717 --> 40:01.917
I'll wear this dress, and I'll be fine.

40:21.118 --> 40:23.984
I read your book.

40:24.051 --> 40:26.283
Did it help?

40:26.350 --> 40:28.617
It did when I sold it.

40:48.250 --> 40:50.884
How you doing?

40:50.951 --> 40:53.250
Better now.

40:53.317 --> 40:56.051
I had such a crummy day.

40:56.118 --> 40:57.650
Yeah?

40:57.717 --> 40:59.383
Uh-Huh.

40:59.450 --> 41:01.984
Well, I think it's about to get worse.

41:05.751 --> 41:07.751
Why?

41:10.650 --> 41:13.517
I have something I need to tell you.

41:13.584 --> 41:16.484
*my love*

41:16.550 --> 41:20.517
*is a young love*

41:20.584 --> 41:27.257
*but I know we'll get this right*
