WEBVTT

00:05.098 --> 00:06.464
You have to stop.

00:06.467 --> 00:09.484
I can't keep letting you put
yourself, or me through this.

00:09.487 --> 00:12.546
I promise, no more.

00:12.549 --> 00:14.594
So it's been nine years since

00:14.597 --> 00:16.590
I've even come close to using my powers.

00:16.592 --> 00:18.692
Do you remember why you
became Black Lightning?

00:18.694 --> 00:20.937
You wanted to give the people hope.

00:20.940 --> 00:23.370
Look, somebody has to do something,

00:23.373 --> 00:25.903
because all of this
policing and marching

00:25.906 --> 00:28.162
and praying, it hasn't changed anything.

00:33.442 --> 00:37.577
It is time that people
know that Black Lightning...

00:39.152 --> 00:40.718
is back.

00:42.784 --> 00:44.962
Previously on Black Lightning...

00:44.965 --> 00:48.220
The sink just crumbled in
my hands like it was nothing.

00:48.223 --> 00:51.725
Lynn and I are making
room for a reconciliation.

00:51.727 --> 00:53.627
I need to take things slow, Jeff.

00:53.629 --> 00:56.429
- The One Hundred got my little girl.
- LaWanda White.

00:56.431 --> 00:57.931
I want my daughter.

01:00.302 --> 01:05.792
It is time that people know
that Black Lightning is back.

01:13.815 --> 01:17.083
Sister LaWanda was one of us.

01:21.355 --> 01:22.688
A friend...

01:24.249 --> 01:25.715
a mother...

01:27.162 --> 01:32.165
and she most certainly...
was a woman of God.

01:32.167 --> 01:33.400
That's right!

01:33.402 --> 01:36.336
Sister LaWanda fought the good fight,

01:37.388 --> 01:39.121
and now she's gone.

01:40.375 --> 01:43.577
And all Sister LaWanda did
was try to save her child.

01:43.579 --> 01:45.412
Where's Anissa?

01:47.000 --> 01:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:56.057 --> 02:58.515
And The One Hundred
tried to send a message

02:58.518 --> 03:00.512
by killing her!

03:00.515 --> 03:03.956
They wanted us to stay
down, to stay scared,

03:03.959 --> 03:07.560
to have the little bit
of life they gave us.

03:07.562 --> 03:09.909
Well, I'm standing here
tonight to tell you,

03:09.912 --> 03:12.552
that we're gonna send The
One Hundred back a message...

03:12.555 --> 03:14.255
That's right. That's right.

03:14.258 --> 03:16.892
By following Sister LaWanda's example.

03:18.573 --> 03:23.820
So I need 100 God-fearing
people to march with me.

03:25.247 --> 03:29.949
I said I need 100 God-fearing
people to march with me!

03:31.486 --> 03:34.254
So that we can take back our community,

03:34.256 --> 03:37.734
so that our kids can live free
of the drugs, and the violence,

03:37.737 --> 03:41.033
and all the damage that
goes from living in a place

03:41.036 --> 03:43.236
that nobody gives a damn about!

03:46.554 --> 03:47.720
Stand up!

03:49.717 --> 03:50.883
March with me.

03:50.886 --> 03:53.219
Stand up if you wanna march with me.

03:53.222 --> 03:54.989
Stand up if you wanna march with...

04:11.149 --> 04:12.315
Damn it!

04:22.323 --> 04:23.756
It's my breathing.

04:24.446 --> 04:25.645
Okay.

04:26.412 --> 04:30.223
Look, Reverend, I don't support
paying The One Hundred for anything,

04:30.226 --> 04:32.326
but I get that's where we are right now.

04:32.329 --> 04:33.980
And I know the police have to do a lot

04:33.982 --> 04:36.015
- to get the community...
- Amen. Amen. Amen.

04:36.017 --> 04:37.450
Amen, brother.

04:37.453 --> 04:39.405
You see,

04:39.408 --> 04:41.940
we wouldn't have to pay for protection

04:41.943 --> 04:43.818
if half the police
department didn't have

04:43.821 --> 04:45.692
their hands in The
One Hundred's pockets.

04:45.694 --> 04:48.372
Well, I'm not in The
One Hundred's pockets,

04:48.375 --> 04:50.542
and good work is being done.

04:50.545 --> 04:52.244
Now we may not get there in the moment,

04:52.247 --> 04:54.247
but we will get there in the end.

04:54.266 --> 04:57.270
See, we gonna put our trust
in the power of the Almighty,

04:57.272 --> 05:00.133
because we damn sure
can't put our trust in you.

05:00.136 --> 05:01.569
You got that?

05:01.572 --> 05:04.973
Come on, that... that's not
true, Jeremiah, and you know it.

05:04.976 --> 05:07.016
What, those crooked cops

05:07.019 --> 05:08.688
send you down here like the overseer?

05:09.954 --> 05:12.521
Put the slaves in check, huh?

05:14.756 --> 05:17.891
While you up in the pulpit
with a $25,000 watch on,

05:17.893 --> 05:21.325
wiping your forehead
with a silk handkerchief,

05:21.328 --> 05:25.598
I'm scraping young black
men's bodies off the concrete.

05:25.601 --> 05:28.435
- The street is my pulpit.
- Billy. Okay.

05:30.582 --> 05:32.582
I wear work shoes.

05:33.425 --> 05:36.693
What kind of shoes you wear, Reverend?

05:41.216 --> 05:42.415
All right.

06:22.008 --> 06:24.324
Well, I'm not gonna call off my protest.

06:24.326 --> 06:27.894
And, quite frankly, I'm surprised
that you, as a parent and an educator,

06:27.896 --> 06:30.086
would... would try to stop me.

06:31.609 --> 06:34.724
I want to save you
from yourself, Jeremiah.

06:34.727 --> 06:37.871
Though I have no reason to
believe you'll listen to me.

06:37.873 --> 06:40.320
Freeland has always listened to you.

06:41.562 --> 06:46.331
When you raced, now from
your perch at Garfield...

06:47.948 --> 06:49.753
they used to call you Black Jesus.

06:49.756 --> 06:51.196
Yeah, well, maybe they listened to me

06:51.198 --> 06:52.699
because they believe in what I'm saying.

06:52.701 --> 06:55.401
No. We listened because
you were one of us.

06:57.225 --> 06:59.526
You were out in those
streets fighting with us.

07:00.962 --> 07:02.407
Now it seems like the only ones you

07:02.410 --> 07:04.320
care about are the ones in your school,

07:04.323 --> 07:05.657
or the ones in your home.

07:05.660 --> 07:07.133
That's not true, Jeremiah.

07:07.136 --> 07:08.602
Never has been.

07:09.838 --> 07:11.638
Freeland is my home too, man.

07:11.640 --> 07:12.972
Really?

07:12.975 --> 07:14.941
I fight the best way I know how.

07:16.777 --> 07:18.438
Look, man,

07:18.441 --> 07:20.361
I know you and Henderson think I'm

07:20.364 --> 07:22.557
marching for my own glory, but I'm not.

07:26.521 --> 07:28.454
I'm tired, man.

07:29.524 --> 07:32.792
If it ain't the police
killing us, we killing us.

07:32.795 --> 07:34.628
And it's time for me...

07:37.363 --> 07:41.258
It's time for us to take our lives back,

07:41.261 --> 07:44.474
even if it means we have
to be willing to die.

07:44.477 --> 07:46.306
You understand?

07:46.309 --> 07:48.133
LaWanda didn't want to die.

07:48.136 --> 07:51.001
Yeah. But she knew it was possible.

07:52.248 --> 07:54.214
Yet she persisted.

07:55.388 --> 07:57.822
Because Black Lightning gave her hope.

07:57.825 --> 08:00.102
- Black Lightning?
- Yeah.

08:01.890 --> 08:06.092
See, Black Lightning made her
believe she could save her daughter.

08:06.795 --> 08:09.196
Yeah, but she failed, Jeremiah.

08:09.199 --> 08:10.618
They killed her.

08:10.621 --> 08:14.934
Yeah. It's no accident that he
came back after all these years.

08:14.937 --> 08:16.922
That's God's work.

08:16.925 --> 08:20.618
You see, that gives me hope.

08:20.621 --> 08:24.544
That with Black Lightning's
help, and with God's help,

08:24.547 --> 08:27.046
we can save this community.

08:27.048 --> 08:29.449
Okay, what if you're wrong, Reverend?

08:29.452 --> 08:30.651
Hmm?

08:31.680 --> 08:34.179
What if you're wrong
about Black Lightning?

08:34.183 --> 08:35.582
I'm not.

08:38.080 --> 08:42.316
And what I believe is that he
is the answer to our prayers.

08:52.797 --> 08:58.313

09:01.715 --> 09:03.761
Heroes inspire people.

09:03.763 --> 09:05.262
The reverend is no exception.

09:05.264 --> 09:08.025
Yeah, I don't wanna inspire
people to get themselves killed.

09:08.028 --> 09:11.684
Watching hundreds of people
over multiple city blocks.

09:11.687 --> 09:14.017
Uh, what if I'm not ready?

09:14.020 --> 09:15.696
You'll be ready.

09:15.699 --> 09:19.008
I've been able to decrease the
resistance within the suit's circuitry,

09:19.010 --> 09:21.311
which will allow for a smoother
transfer of power to you.

09:21.313 --> 09:23.646
Also, with this arm,

09:23.648 --> 09:26.375
you should be able to create a
thinner stream of electricity.

09:26.378 --> 09:27.765
Why would I do that?

09:27.768 --> 09:29.933
You'll be dealing with a large crowd.

09:29.936 --> 09:32.958
You'll want a targeted strike
with less collateral damage.

09:32.961 --> 09:35.661
Also, lower voltage requirement,
reduced power drain...

09:35.664 --> 09:38.061
Yeah. Okay, okay. Let's just test it.

09:38.063 --> 09:40.196
Okay. Here we go.

09:43.828 --> 09:46.375
A thinner stream.

09:47.823 --> 09:49.022
Again.

10:00.819 --> 10:02.251
Come on, Jefferson.

10:02.253 --> 10:04.320
Focus. Again.

10:26.845 --> 10:28.411
Again.

11:04.449 --> 11:07.350
My grandmother always told me that

11:07.352 --> 11:09.485
if you don't write a thank you note,

11:09.487 --> 11:11.788
it's as if the good
thing never happened.

11:13.258 --> 11:15.887
This is mine,

11:15.890 --> 11:19.095
for all you lost over Lala's stupidity.

11:21.866 --> 11:26.102
Unless you want me to throw
that bag at Black Lightning,

11:26.104 --> 11:28.471
doesn't really solve your real problem.

11:28.474 --> 11:30.148
Black Lightning is dead.

11:30.905 --> 11:32.905
I killed him my damn self.

11:35.612 --> 11:39.381
Tobias, are you a church-going man?

11:39.384 --> 11:42.192
No disrespect, Lady Eve,

11:42.195 --> 11:45.755
but my life hasn't exactly
led me down a spiritual path.

11:45.758 --> 11:48.291
Well, I'm going to tell you

11:48.293 --> 11:52.462
that the Good Book
helps folks stay in line.

11:53.498 --> 11:58.184
And then here comes Black Lightning,

11:58.187 --> 12:01.070
and they think they don't have to.

12:01.973 --> 12:04.843
Take Reverend Holt, for instance.

12:05.710 --> 12:08.044
He's planning a march.

12:08.046 --> 12:10.146
A march.

12:10.148 --> 12:12.749
He's gonna leadleverybody
to the promised land

12:12.751 --> 12:17.153
and take away our protection
money when he gets there.

12:19.457 --> 12:20.757
He can't be that stupid.

12:22.861 --> 12:24.427
Well,

12:24.429 --> 12:29.165
another pastor realized
the risk in that proposal

12:29.167 --> 12:32.258
and was smart enough to let me know.

12:35.306 --> 12:37.607
I thank you for passing that on.

12:37.610 --> 12:39.842
Mmm.

12:39.844 --> 12:42.178
What I expect

12:42.180 --> 12:45.248
is for you and that girl
with death in her eyes,

12:45.250 --> 12:46.929
to take care of it.

12:48.219 --> 12:50.640
I don't mind people believing in God.

12:52.209 --> 12:56.929
They just can't believe that
they can take back these streets.

12:58.997 --> 13:00.630
Amen, Lady Eve.

13:11.209 --> 13:14.429
And then we can check
into the hotel at 2:00.

13:16.748 --> 13:18.981
Yo, did you tell your
parents where you were going?

13:20.251 --> 13:23.419
Oh, I haven't yet. But I will.

13:24.823 --> 13:26.304
You have condoms, right?

13:26.307 --> 13:28.391
Yeah.

13:28.393 --> 13:30.092
You sure?

13:30.095 --> 13:31.661
Right.

13:33.565 --> 13:35.794
- You good?
- Yeah.

13:35.797 --> 13:38.367
I'm good. Uh, it's just...

13:40.471 --> 13:41.838
Just what?

13:41.840 --> 13:43.406
I know you haven't changed your mind?

13:43.408 --> 13:46.304
What? No. No. No, no, no, no. I, uh...

13:49.480 --> 13:50.880
J, I lied.

13:52.817 --> 13:54.317
What you mean you lied?

13:54.320 --> 13:55.586
I'm a...

13:57.155 --> 13:58.487
I haven't done it before.

13:58.489 --> 14:00.690
Look, I...

14:00.692 --> 14:02.792
I was afraid to tell you. I mean...

14:02.794 --> 14:05.628
I wanted you to think that I
knew what I was doing, but...

14:06.531 --> 14:08.698
Damn it, I was just trying to have swag.

14:08.701 --> 14:11.267
Next thing I know, lies were
coming out of my mouth, and...

14:12.604 --> 14:14.337
I'm sorry.

14:14.340 --> 14:16.117
Really, I am. I'm... I'm really sorry.

14:19.444 --> 14:21.177
So...

14:21.179 --> 14:23.646
A fine-ass virgin tells the truth

14:23.648 --> 14:25.625
and risks remaining a virgin?

14:27.552 --> 14:31.053
Khalil, my virgin self couldn't
find you sexier right now.

14:33.725 --> 14:35.157
Stop.

14:55.380 --> 14:56.567
Hey.

14:56.570 --> 14:59.637
I'm sorry. Do you need
me to get out of your way?

14:59.640 --> 15:01.183
It's kind of like I've moved in.

15:01.185 --> 15:02.752
No. Not at all.

15:02.755 --> 15:05.187
Can I help you find anything?

15:05.190 --> 15:06.765
No, I'm, uh...

15:06.768 --> 15:10.906
I'm just doing some
research on genetic mutation.

15:10.909 --> 15:12.576
You doing it for school?

15:14.632 --> 15:15.831
No.

15:17.895 --> 15:19.361
Somebody sick?

15:20.245 --> 15:21.611
I hope not.

15:24.042 --> 15:26.242
Well, I hope not too.

15:27.578 --> 15:29.364
Anissa.

15:29.367 --> 15:30.780
Grace.

15:43.695 --> 15:45.187
What are you reading?

15:48.664 --> 15:50.130
The Outsiders.

15:50.133 --> 15:51.532
It's not my thing.

15:51.535 --> 15:54.669
You know, if you're reading
about genetic mutations for fun,

15:54.672 --> 15:56.539
maybe it should be.

15:56.541 --> 15:58.674
I mean, this is nerd bait.

15:58.676 --> 16:02.378
Young folks with outsized
powers traveling the world,

16:02.381 --> 16:04.614
knocking bad guys on their asses.

16:05.948 --> 16:07.898
And then there are the costumes.

16:07.901 --> 16:09.914
Ooh, I do love a costume.

16:11.319 --> 16:13.856
Well, I tend bar at the
Ruby-Red Lipstick bar,

16:13.859 --> 16:16.392
and we do cosplay
party on Friday nights.

16:16.394 --> 16:18.515
You dress up as any superhero you want.

16:18.518 --> 16:21.859
Supergirl. Looker, if
vampires are more your thing.

16:23.768 --> 16:26.102
I don't really have a thing.

16:27.271 --> 16:28.671
Not yet.

16:29.774 --> 16:31.440
You should come to the party.

16:32.477 --> 16:34.443
I would really like you to.

16:35.113 --> 16:36.312
Okay.

16:38.250 --> 16:41.183
Only one squad car can work the march.

16:41.185 --> 16:42.242
What?

16:42.245 --> 16:45.008
That's almost guaranteeing that
somebody is gonna get killed.

16:45.011 --> 16:47.690
- Where'd these orders come from?
- No one will say.

16:47.692 --> 16:49.925
I asked my commander,
and then the chief,

16:49.927 --> 16:52.361
and eventually I tapped out
at the deputy mayor's office

16:52.363 --> 16:54.397
when she wouldn't return my phone call.

16:54.399 --> 16:55.875
Somebody's setting him up.

16:55.878 --> 16:58.424
Jeff, you got to talk
to him. Try to convince

16:58.427 --> 17:00.970
him to cancel, reschedule,
take a vacation...

17:00.972 --> 17:02.671
No, I tried after you walked out.

17:02.673 --> 17:05.540
He won't do it. He's...
he's been inspired.

17:05.544 --> 17:06.910
About what?

17:08.346 --> 17:09.645
Black Lightning.

17:10.580 --> 17:13.115
Black Lightning.

17:13.921 --> 17:16.121
Like I don't have enough damn problems.

17:16.988 --> 17:18.354
He's gonna get us all killed.

17:23.127 --> 17:24.593
I hope not.

17:24.596 --> 17:28.672
Here's your parade route.

17:30.935 --> 17:35.071
Okay, now, if Henderson can't change
the parade route, maybe we can.

17:35.073 --> 17:37.773
You know, pick something
that minimizes the chaos,

17:37.775 --> 17:41.851
makes it easier for Black
Lightning to protect the marchers.

17:41.854 --> 17:44.713
Hasn't the paperwork already been sent

17:44.716 --> 17:46.927
to the good reverend and the
people that set up the parade route?

17:46.929 --> 17:48.284
Yes.

17:48.286 --> 17:50.619
So, even if I break into the
PD's computers and alter it,

17:50.621 --> 17:52.922
there's no guarantee
everyone gets the message.

17:52.924 --> 17:56.914
No, I know. I was thinking of something
a bit more old-school than that.

17:57.914 --> 18:01.508
What? Shriners on lawn mowers
to lead people the other way?

18:01.511 --> 18:02.977
Close.

18:02.980 --> 18:07.149
I was thinking more like a handsome
Italian gentleman in coveralls.

18:08.133 --> 18:11.440
Whenever you call me handsome,
I almost always end up dirty.

18:11.442 --> 18:13.943
Well, then you won't be
disappointed by my plan.

18:17.305 --> 18:20.039
Hmm. Anissa's not just
late, she's not coming.

18:21.098 --> 18:22.446
I'm not surprised.

18:24.079 --> 18:25.979
I haven't seen much of her lately.

18:25.981 --> 18:28.381
Well, we raised her to be
a strong, independent woman,

18:28.383 --> 18:30.550
and it looks like we succeeded.

18:30.552 --> 18:33.236
Family dinners will be
an intermittent priority.

18:33.239 --> 18:37.390
Mmm-hmm. Jennifer's only two
years away from going to college.

18:38.960 --> 18:41.594
- She'll stop coming, too.
- That she will.

18:45.834 --> 18:47.500
I'm wondering...

18:48.505 --> 18:51.543
when she doesn't want
to eat with us either...

18:53.512 --> 18:56.280
will you still show
up to dinner with me?

18:58.547 --> 19:00.106
You know what I want?

19:00.916 --> 19:03.016
I wanna stop worrying about you.

19:04.450 --> 19:07.017
Too many nights of seeing
you broken and bleeding, Jeff.

19:07.020 --> 19:08.382
Are we gonna do that right now?

19:10.184 --> 19:13.907
Mmm. Anissa's not coming.

19:13.910 --> 19:15.476
Family dinner is optional?

19:15.479 --> 19:17.059
Uh, not for you.

19:17.062 --> 19:18.626
You're still our little girl.

19:18.629 --> 19:20.867
Well, Anissa not coming sucks.

19:20.869 --> 19:22.602
Language.

19:22.604 --> 19:26.506
Sorry. This turn of
events is dispiriting,

19:26.508 --> 19:28.920
as I wished for her
support during this repast.

19:32.013 --> 19:34.347
What do you need support for?

19:35.717 --> 19:37.584
I've decided I'm ready to have sex.

19:44.826 --> 19:46.059
What did she say?

19:46.828 --> 19:50.519
We are happy that you came to us

19:50.522 --> 19:52.568
like we've always encouraged you to.

19:52.571 --> 19:54.371
So happy.

19:55.403 --> 19:59.522
And glad that you felt comfortable.

19:59.525 --> 20:01.292
You are so young.

20:03.278 --> 20:05.211
How old were you guys?

20:10.352 --> 20:12.285
Never mind.

20:14.029 --> 20:17.682
Your mother and I loved
each other very much.

20:17.685 --> 20:19.124
Mmm-hmm.

20:19.127 --> 20:20.443
Wait.

20:20.446 --> 20:24.264
Are you saying the first time you
both had sex was with each other?

20:24.267 --> 20:25.764
No...

20:25.767 --> 20:29.535
We think it's very important that you

20:29.538 --> 20:31.871
have sex with the right person.

20:31.874 --> 20:35.217
Okay. Noted.

20:35.220 --> 20:37.862
So, um, Saturday's the day.

20:37.865 --> 20:39.240
I'll be out in the afternoon,

20:39.243 --> 20:41.098
but I'll be home by curfew.

20:48.924 --> 20:51.467
I don't think either one of them
said more than, "Pass the salt"

20:51.470 --> 20:53.737
for the rest of the meal.

20:53.740 --> 20:58.130
It was a little cruel to
spring it during family dinner.

20:58.133 --> 21:01.067
Well, my plan was for you to be there,

21:01.069 --> 21:02.402
to help 'em through it. But...

21:02.404 --> 21:04.971
- My bad. I'm sorry.
- Mmm-hmm.

21:04.974 --> 21:08.568
Church, family dinner...
Suddenly you're a ghost.

21:15.850 --> 21:17.216
You're okay though, right?

21:18.386 --> 21:21.287
- Nothing bad is happening?
- I am fine.

21:22.935 --> 21:24.134
Good.

21:24.137 --> 21:26.159
Then that means you can
go to the march with me.

21:26.161 --> 21:28.861
Because I've never been to one,
and you're the pro, Harriet.

21:28.863 --> 21:32.665
Mmm... I don't think I wanna
go to the reverend's march.

21:34.135 --> 21:37.236
The girl with the marching shoes
and the frequent-marchers card

21:37.238 --> 21:39.339
doesn't wanna go to the march?

21:40.775 --> 21:42.842
What's going on with you?

21:44.479 --> 21:46.553
I'm just tired of walking around with a

21:46.556 --> 21:49.897
sign, trying to change people's hearts.

21:49.900 --> 21:51.608
I wanna do more.

21:53.955 --> 21:56.503
Fine, well, don't
think of it as marching.

21:56.506 --> 21:58.891
Think of it as being with your sister.

22:00.061 --> 22:02.195
Something you've forgotten how to do.

22:06.868 --> 22:08.134
Okay.

22:10.005 --> 22:11.504
I'll go with you.

22:11.507 --> 22:12.839
Good.

22:14.142 --> 22:16.943
Now, let's talk about birth control.

22:16.946 --> 22:19.012
This has been a long night.

22:19.014 --> 22:20.546
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

22:26.421 --> 22:27.620
Hey.

22:27.724 --> 22:28.923
Hey.

22:30.099 --> 22:33.458
I thought we should discuss
our epic fail last night.

22:34.529 --> 22:36.451
- My mind went blank.
- I know.

22:36.454 --> 22:38.754
And then it was downhill from there.

22:38.757 --> 22:42.435
I'm glad that we flamed out together.

22:43.705 --> 22:45.943
I always tell people you're
the unflappable parent.

22:45.946 --> 22:47.773
Well, I made an
appointment with Dr. Bass.

22:47.776 --> 22:50.910
I think it's easier if one
of us follows up with her.

22:50.912 --> 22:52.145
Yeah.

22:52.834 --> 22:55.615
Are you sure we're not
being too liberal here?

22:55.617 --> 22:59.256
I mean, my father would say
this is some white-folks mess.

22:59.259 --> 23:02.854
The girl told us that she
is having sex on Saturday.

23:02.857 --> 23:04.857
Like it was nothing.
If I had done that...

23:04.859 --> 23:07.560
And that is why I will
follow up with Dr. Bass,

23:07.562 --> 23:09.162
because you are flapping.

23:10.131 --> 23:13.199
Look, we asked her to
come to us, and she did.

23:13.201 --> 23:15.635
At least she's not sneaking
off and getting pregnant.

23:15.637 --> 23:17.170
Mmm. Mmm.

23:17.172 --> 23:18.304
Don't worry.

23:18.306 --> 23:19.686
I got you.

23:27.892 --> 23:29.983
What is on your mind, Lynn Stewart?

23:32.053 --> 23:34.419
You know, I was thinking since you're

23:34.422 --> 23:36.723
going back to being Black Lightning,

23:36.725 --> 23:40.126
maybe I should take a bigger
role in the girls' lives.

23:40.129 --> 23:42.828
Yeah. Yeah.

23:42.831 --> 23:46.058
I mean, if Jennifer leaves
Freeland and goes to college,

23:46.061 --> 23:48.034
you won't regret the extra time.

23:48.036 --> 23:50.403
I wonder if she should move in with me?

23:52.239 --> 23:53.705
Move?

23:55.210 --> 23:56.743
No.

23:56.745 --> 23:58.411
What if you get hurt, Jeff?

23:58.413 --> 24:00.061
What if she sees you beaten up?

24:00.064 --> 24:01.730
What is that gonna
do to our little girl?

24:01.733 --> 24:02.951
I don't wanna talk about this.

24:02.954 --> 24:05.041
Jeff, I'm her mother. I have a right.

24:05.044 --> 24:06.443
No.

24:10.812 --> 24:13.179
I'll let you know when we see Dr. Bass.

24:34.783 --> 24:35.982
Khalil.

24:37.485 --> 24:39.418
Hey, Mr. Pierce.

24:39.420 --> 24:41.636
Oh, I shaved a tenth off my split today.

24:41.639 --> 24:43.873
I think it was that new
weight routine you suggested.

24:43.876 --> 24:46.463
Oh, great to hear it.

24:46.466 --> 24:51.639
You know that my, uh, concern for
you extends beyond the track, right?

24:51.642 --> 24:54.361
Uh, yeah. Yes, sir, of course.

24:54.364 --> 24:55.842
Good. Good.

24:55.845 --> 24:57.193
How do you shower?

24:58.406 --> 25:00.540
Uh, um...

25:04.112 --> 25:06.479
Uh... Mr. P, I...

25:06.482 --> 25:08.428
You know, you got your bar of soap...

25:12.020 --> 25:13.953
Well... well, I wash,

25:13.956 --> 25:15.589
use shampoo...

25:17.292 --> 25:18.457
rinse...

25:19.394 --> 25:20.737
Okay.

25:20.740 --> 25:23.196
Then when you get out of the shower...

25:24.999 --> 25:26.248
Okay.

25:26.251 --> 25:31.504
Well, I don't have a mat so I
step on to my towel to dry my feet.

25:34.429 --> 25:35.962
So,

25:37.412 --> 25:38.744
feet,

25:39.714 --> 25:41.147
legs,

25:41.749 --> 25:43.563
etcetera.

25:43.566 --> 25:46.339
Yeah. Yeah, that...
that sounds about right.

25:46.342 --> 25:47.474
Hmm.

25:47.477 --> 25:49.641
So the young man

25:49.644 --> 25:53.492
who wants to have sex with my daughter,

25:53.495 --> 25:57.375
who spends much of his
time in locker rooms,

25:57.378 --> 26:02.068
dries his fungus-covered feet
before he dries his important parts?

26:02.071 --> 26:03.480
Sir, I...

26:03.483 --> 26:07.272
No, no. I'm asking you, do you
wanna give my daughter athlete's foot

26:07.275 --> 26:11.544
in places where athlete's
feet should not be?

26:11.546 --> 26:13.206
I don't think so.

26:13.209 --> 26:14.728
"I don't think so"?

26:14.731 --> 26:16.909
Son, the answer is "no."

26:17.639 --> 26:19.828
And if you don't know that, then maybe

26:19.831 --> 26:23.175
you and Jennifer need to slow down.

27:01.296 --> 27:02.995
Ooh, okay.

27:10.371 --> 27:13.472
So, Miss Black Lives Matter is
cheating on me with an Asian?

27:13.474 --> 27:15.274
- Hey! Watch it!
- Come on. Come on.

27:15.276 --> 27:17.070
I'm not cheating.

27:17.073 --> 27:20.008
Unless dancing in
spandex means anything.

27:20.011 --> 27:22.014
- You look like an Instagram ho.
- You did not...

27:22.016 --> 27:25.151
No, I think you two should
talk about this outside.

27:35.154 --> 27:36.787
You gonna be okay?

27:38.261 --> 27:39.727
Yeah, I'm good.

28:08.763 --> 28:10.077
The serial number's been removed

28:10.080 --> 28:11.746
so you can toss it at the scene.

28:13.001 --> 28:16.002
Though I suggest do not leave it
covered with your fingerprints.

28:17.472 --> 28:18.671
Okay.

28:24.838 --> 28:26.404
Is there a problem?

28:30.284 --> 28:32.284
You seem reluctant to pick it up.

28:32.943 --> 28:34.442
I'm not wearing gloves.

28:42.680 --> 28:44.526
You agreed to do this.

28:44.529 --> 28:47.099
Said you wanted to move
up in the organization.

28:47.101 --> 28:48.801
Maybe take Lala's place, right?

28:48.803 --> 28:50.403
Yes.

28:50.405 --> 28:51.771
Then I need you to send a message.

28:53.141 --> 28:57.410
These are my streets. And
nobody messes with my streets.

28:58.444 --> 29:00.211
Stop bleeding on my desk.

29:06.788 --> 29:08.287
Thank you.

29:12.793 --> 29:14.518
Another day and another young man

29:14.520 --> 29:16.688
has been shot and killed
on the streets of Freeland.

29:16.690 --> 29:18.924
His name, Jamal Allen Brown.

29:18.926 --> 29:22.060
And so far, police have not
made any arrests. Residents...

29:22.062 --> 29:24.236
How'd it go?

29:24.239 --> 29:25.864
She took her key back.

29:27.802 --> 29:29.101
I'm sorry.

29:29.794 --> 29:31.870
No. She was right. We were done.

29:32.736 --> 29:34.203
I just...

29:36.176 --> 29:38.810
So much has been changing in my life

29:38.812 --> 29:43.549
that I was just holding on to
something that wasn't working,

29:45.019 --> 29:46.989
just so I had something to hold on to.

29:47.788 --> 29:50.956
Today, I felt invincible,
you know? And now, I just...

29:50.958 --> 29:52.755
Back to reality.

29:54.073 --> 29:56.622
We're all just playing
at being superheroes.

30:01.201 --> 30:03.001
It'd be nice, though.

30:03.003 --> 30:05.244
Superpowers.

30:05.247 --> 30:06.680
A way to make the world a better

30:06.683 --> 30:09.051
place, you know, really change things,

30:09.054 --> 30:10.965
fight the bad guys,

30:10.968 --> 30:13.035
save the good guys.

30:14.315 --> 30:17.822
Saving the world would
be lonely, I think.

30:17.825 --> 30:20.485
You have to keep your identity secret,

30:20.487 --> 30:22.658
even from the people you love.

30:22.661 --> 30:25.490
Right. Because they'd worry.

30:25.493 --> 30:27.659
Yeah.

30:29.030 --> 30:32.798
Oh, damn, look at the
time. Okay, I, uh...

30:32.800 --> 30:36.335
I've gotta go get out of this
spandex because I promised my sister

30:36.337 --> 30:37.911
I would go to this march with her.

30:37.914 --> 30:40.192
All right, good night,
Miss Black Lives Matter.

30:41.019 --> 30:42.319
Goodnight, Grace.

30:42.322 --> 30:44.942
Our detour sent the march down here,

30:44.945 --> 30:47.779
and this is the highest
point on our new route.

30:47.781 --> 30:49.715
You'll be able to see
almost the entire march.

30:49.718 --> 30:51.783
Now, if they just wanna kill Holt,

30:51.785 --> 30:53.585
it'll likely be a single gunman,

30:53.587 --> 30:56.688
waiting to take him out
at his most public moment.

30:58.392 --> 30:59.958
But that's not what I'd do.

31:01.969 --> 31:04.630
I hate it when you play the
most-not-likely-scenario game.

31:04.632 --> 31:07.466
The One Hundred doesn't wanna
be in the martyr-making business.

31:07.468 --> 31:09.268
They wanna be in the fear business.

31:09.271 --> 31:10.804
So, kill marchers.

31:10.807 --> 31:11.911
Exactly.

31:11.914 --> 31:14.115
If you put poison in aspirin,
people stop buying aspirin.

31:14.117 --> 31:15.841
If you make it deadly to protest...

31:15.844 --> 31:18.684
People will live with their misery
rather thr dying trying to change it.

31:22.238 --> 31:24.356
It's not easy to kill
someone in cold blood.

31:24.359 --> 31:26.473
Your gunman is gonna look nervous.

31:28.222 --> 31:29.888
A little bit like you look now.

31:32.678 --> 31:34.111
No, I'm not nervous.

31:35.666 --> 31:37.340
I'm just hoping that
God was listening as

31:37.343 --> 31:39.136
hard as I was when the
reverend was talking.

31:40.934 --> 31:42.423
I guess we'll see.

31:42.426 --> 31:43.935
Yeah.

31:43.938 --> 31:45.471
I'll get the suit ready.

31:50.177 --> 31:53.786
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

31:53.929 --> 31:57.403
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

32:32.419 --> 32:35.801
Damn it. Lynn and the
girls are down there.

32:35.804 --> 32:39.262
There's nothing you can do
about it now. Stay focused.

34:09.512 --> 34:10.844
They are singing.

34:12.185 --> 34:14.498

church-going Negroes.

singing and praying.

I need to look at your wound, okay?

35:07.014 --> 35:08.247
It may hurt a bit.

35:09.717 --> 35:11.250
You need to go.

35:13.754 --> 35:16.679
You're gonna be okay. It's okay.

35:28.911 --> 35:31.752
Hey, hey, hang in there. I'm right here.

35:31.755 --> 35:34.481
Please, you have to sit in the rooms.

35:36.018 --> 35:38.658
It's gonna be okay, it's gonna be
okay. Just... It's gonna be okay.

35:53.861 --> 35:55.677
Jen, come on, let's sit down.

35:55.680 --> 35:56.980
Did you hear anything?

35:56.983 --> 35:59.263
Well, I just asked them
for some tissues, I'm sorry.

36:08.245 --> 36:10.045
He's gonna be okay, right?

36:10.970 --> 36:13.982
I, um... I don't know.

36:16.325 --> 36:19.760
Well, they said... that
Rev. Holt was gonna be okay.

36:20.553 --> 36:22.286
Yeah, they did.

36:24.533 --> 36:28.335
Well, maybe... Maybe
Khalil will be okay too.

36:30.905 --> 36:33.677
It could be. I certainly hope so.

36:33.680 --> 36:35.740
Come here. Come here.

36:42.442 --> 36:45.927
It's okay, okay? You'll be good.

36:48.557 --> 36:50.000
At least two are injure

36:50.003 --> 36:52.018
but witnesses say Black Lightning

36:52.021 --> 36:54.880
prevented an even larger
tragedy from occurring.

36:54.883 --> 36:57.530
Man, my partner was like,
"Man, you must be high."

36:57.533 --> 36:59.867
I'm like, "No, my dude, I
seen it with my own eyes."

36:59.869 --> 37:02.202
It was like, he had
his hands up like this.

37:02.204 --> 37:04.872
It was crazy. He saved us all.

37:04.874 --> 37:08.221
Well, despite public
support, uh, the police

37:08.224 --> 37:10.945
department are not
happy with his efforts.

37:10.947 --> 37:12.983
Earlier I spoke to Inspector Henderson

37:12.986 --> 37:14.490
from the Freeland Police Department.

37:14.493 --> 37:19.286
He's a vigilante. And violence and
murders are up since he came back.

37:19.288 --> 37:22.356
Whether he is the cause, or the target,

37:22.366 --> 37:26.668
Black Lightning is not making things
better for the citizens of Freeland...

37:26.671 --> 37:29.797
When I heard those bullets,

37:29.799 --> 37:31.398
I thought that was it.

37:31.401 --> 37:33.662
I'm glad that you and
the girls are okay.

37:37.940 --> 37:39.244
If I had known you were thinking

37:39.247 --> 37:40.874
about coming, I would have warned you.

37:40.876 --> 37:42.576
It was a last-minute thing.

37:42.578 --> 37:44.511
Jennifer told me she was meeting Anissa,

37:44.513 --> 37:47.114
and I thought it would be
some quality family time.

37:54.023 --> 37:55.356
I'm sorry.

37:57.412 --> 37:59.800
No, it's not your fault. I...
I should have said something.

37:59.803 --> 38:03.664
No, I... I mean for suggesting
Jennifer come live with me.

38:03.667 --> 38:05.615
I lashed out.

38:05.618 --> 38:09.487
It sounds crazy but the bullets
gave me some perspective.

38:12.423 --> 38:14.123
Danger is everywhere.

38:22.069 --> 38:23.469
I'm sorry.

38:25.678 --> 38:27.311
I really am.

38:29.392 --> 38:31.558
Hey, I guess, deep down, I always knew

38:31.560 --> 38:33.994
that Black Lightning
would eventually win.

38:34.878 --> 38:38.246
It doesn't mean I have to
accept my defeat gracefully.

38:41.281 --> 38:45.917
You know, even if we don't
live under the same roof,

38:47.369 --> 38:50.503
you three are my
priority, suit or no suit.

38:55.872 --> 38:58.173
You're a good man, Jefferson Pierce.

39:25.122 --> 39:26.622
Sorry, Jefferson.

39:36.898 --> 39:38.732
So what's going on with you?

39:40.330 --> 39:41.807
Huh?

39:41.810 --> 39:43.797
Dad says you're never home.

39:43.799 --> 39:47.093
You don't call. You
skipped family dinner.

39:50.514 --> 39:53.482
Do you remember when you
told us you were a lesbian?

39:59.248 --> 40:01.474
Silent for about a minute,

40:02.885 --> 40:04.485
and then hugs.

40:09.439 --> 40:12.740
You know, a mother's love is
a very powerful thing, Anissa.

40:13.586 --> 40:14.685
Mmm-hmm.

40:14.688 --> 40:17.089
I sense something's
weighing heavy on you.

40:19.235 --> 40:21.002
Nothing you could do, or say would

40:21.005 --> 40:23.270
ever make me stop loving you, ever.

40:26.208 --> 40:27.758
Your silence worries me more than

40:27.761 --> 40:29.550
anything you could probably say.

40:38.923 --> 40:40.756
Chenoa and I broke up.

40:43.162 --> 40:45.029
I'm sorry to hear that, baby.

40:47.163 --> 40:50.430
But you were not into that
girl the way she was into you.

40:52.523 --> 40:55.791
So when you're ready to tell
me what's really going on,

40:57.021 --> 40:58.921
I'm here for you.

41:00.715 --> 41:01.981
Okay?

41:03.227 --> 41:04.778
Yeah, Mom.

41:09.766 --> 41:12.486
Um, the bullet hit his spine.

41:14.315 --> 41:16.081
Khalil might not walk again.

41:17.126 --> 41:19.399
Oh, sweetheart. I'm sorry.

41:20.496 --> 41:21.945
Mmm.

41:21.948 --> 41:23.330
I'm so sorry.

41:23.332 --> 41:25.465
I don't give a damn what the police say.

41:25.467 --> 41:29.369
Black Lightning is out here in
these streets with these young folks,

41:29.371 --> 41:32.057
trying to stop them
from killing each other.

41:32.060 --> 41:34.007
Black Lightning's like an angel,

41:34.009 --> 41:37.703
a costumed answer to all our prayers.
