It stopped bleeding.

01:28.339 --> 01:31.968
That's because your blood is freezing
as it's hitting the air.

01:34.804 --> 01:36.264
I think
my leg is frozen.

You're a crazy person.

That wouldn't be
any fun.

04:47.497 --> 04:50.166
If it's appendicitis down there,
her appendix ruptures, she dies.

04:50.291 --> 04:52.543
There's nothing we can do.
If it's a stone, she takes pain meds,

04:52.669 --> 04:54.504
stone passes.
There's nothing we need to do.

04:54.629 --> 04:56.506
Could be a struvite
kidney stone.

04:56.631 --> 04:58.549
Most kidney stones
are calcium and benign.

04:58.675 --> 05:00.593
Why would you
suspect a struvite stone?

05:00.718 --> 05:02.804
Because he said
kidney stones were boring.

05:02.929 --> 05:05.682
TAUB: It's possible.
She's on birth control.

05:05.807 --> 05:07.850
Lots of sex could lead
to urinary tract infection,

If it's a struvite stone, she
needs to break it up quickly

05:17.527 --> 05:19.112
before the infection
shuts down her kidneys.

05:19.237 --> 05:20.780
This is where
it gets fun.

05:21.948 --> 05:25.743
These are the supplies and medications
she has available.

05:28.871 --> 05:30.540
Nothing here that could
break up a kidney stone.

05:31.249 --> 05:32.542
What else do they
have down there?

05:33.084 --> 05:34.127

05:34.252 --> 05:35.837
I don't mean medical stuff. Other stuff.

05:37.171 --> 05:39.215

06:21.924 --> 06:24.343

Charging patients for cable is bringing
in 13 grand a month.

06:27.430 --> 06:32.560
Until this injustice is righted,
I am going to waste 13 grand a day.

06:48.451 --> 06:50.244

Why? No way you're just
doing her a favor.

07:57.019 --> 07:58.729
ER is standing room only.

07:58.855 --> 08:00.189

to make a mistake.

08:00.565 --> 08:01.941
Find it so I can
blackmail her.

08:03.276 --> 08:04.443

<i>Generally not a good idea to swap fluids

09:01.959 --> 09:05.421
Struvite stones are possible
in people who don't have sex.

09:05.546 --> 09:07.548
They're certainly possible
in people who claim not to...

09:07.673 --> 09:11.177
I've had no UTI's,
no pain on urination.

09:11.302 --> 09:13.763
You do realize that only one of us
is a real doctor.

09:13.888 --> 09:16.724
<i>You do realize only one of us has any
control over my actions.</i>

09:20.436 --> 09:22.730
Dr. Milton, are you able
to run a CHEM-7?

09:22.855 --> 09:23.773
Yes.

09:23.898 --> 09:25.524
Well, that'd tell us if her kidney
function is declining.

09:26.025 --> 09:27.401
If it is, he's right.

09:27.526 --> 09:29.737
Struvite stone's
the most likely explanation.

09:29.862 --> 09:31.656
If not, she's right.

09:36.452 --> 09:39.247
Sorry. I know how you like to avoid
avoiding confrontation.

09:39.372 --> 09:43.709
While we're waiting for that test to
prove me right, start IV cefuroxime.

Keep the infection in the stone from
wiping out your kidneys.

09:46.420 --> 09:48.631

telling me this because...

We don't want to do it.

10:05.940 --> 10:07.108
I don't see
a problem so far.

If our choice is between pissing
House off or pissing you off,

10:10.236 --> 10:11.696
that's not much
of a choice.

10:11.821 --> 10:14.365
So unless
I give House cable,

10:14.490 --> 10:16.242
you're gonna make
my life miserable.

10:16.367 --> 10:17.785
Yes.

10:17.910 --> 10:20.871
And you're telling me this so you won't
feel as guilty when you do it.

10:22.999 --> 10:24.208
Yes.

10:24.500 --> 10:27.253
Accommodating House's
every whim is not my job anymore.

10:27.378 --> 10:29.088

ourselves and tell him she folded.

10:42.685 --> 10:43.686
No.

10:45.563 --> 10:50.192
Your CHEM-7 results showed
your kidney function is declining.

10:50.318 --> 10:51.736
Sounds like
a kidney stone to me.

10:51.861 --> 10:53.237
<i>The decreased function</i>

10:53.362 --> 10:57.241
<i>could be from dehydration caused by
vomiting due to a gallstone.</i>

10:57.366 --> 11:00.745
You agreed that the CHEM-7 would decide
if it was a struvite stone.

11:00.870 --> 11:04.498
I agreed to do the test. The results are
up for interpretation.

11:04.623 --> 11:07.043
I'll re-do the test in an hour
when I'm re-hydrated.

11:07.168 --> 11:10.713
Have you noticed any improvement since
starting the cefuroxime?

11:10.838 --> 11:12.048
<i>Not really. Pain's
about the same.</i>

11:12.173 --> 11:14.884
While you're waiting, we should run
another test with the geology equipment.

11:15.009 --> 11:16.510
You're not taking
the cefuroxime.

11:17.219 --> 11:18.929
She's right-handed.

11:19.055 --> 11:21.807
Means she would put
the <i>N</i> in her left arm.

11:21.932 --> 11:23.601
Catheter in the arm
makes it hard to bend the elbow,

11:23.726 --> 11:25.269

11:25.394 --> 11:28.731
We have a limited supply of medication,
and I am not about to waste it.

11:28.856 --> 11:30.900
Last I checked you had
a limited supply of doctors.

11:31.025 --> 11:35.613
<i>Right before I got sick, one of my crew
members severed his femoral artery.</i>

11:35.738 --> 11:37.114
<i>He needs
the cefuroxime.</i>

11:37.239 --> 11:38.574
<i>Right.
He called dibs.</i>

11:38.699 --> 11:42.745
His need is definitive.
Mine is speculative.

11:43.412 --> 11:44.622
You're breathing fast.

11:44.997 --> 11:46.415
<i>It's because

11:54.256 --> 11:55.341
It's deviating to the left.

Because her right lung
is collapsing.

11:56.967 --> 11:58.636
Cate, is anyone
there with you?

11:58.761 --> 12:00.346
- Sean went to the <i>mess.</i>
- You need to call someone.

12:00.471 --> 12:02.515
There's no time.
Get a syringe and a needle.

12:02.640 --> 12:04.100
- Why am I doing that?
- Shut <i>up</i> and <i>look.</i>

12:06.560 --> 12:07.728
She could pass out.
She needs to...

12:07.853 --> 12:09.188
She needs
to re-inflate that lung.

12:10.106 --> 12:11.857
Okay. Now, pull out
the plunger.

12:11.982 --> 12:13.734
I want you to stab yourself
in your right side

12:13.859 --> 12:16.695

<i>Sounds odd.
Probably is odd.</i>

13:00.489 --> 13:02.241
<i>We should discuss this,
then call her back.</i>

13:02.366 --> 13:06.245
No, it's fine. I made sure we got
the South Pole long distance plan.

13:06.662 --> 13:08.622
Her latest kidney

13:08.747 --> 13:10.249
<i>I know what it shows. I ran it.</i>

13:10.666 --> 13:13.252
The more you interrupt, the longer my

13:13.377 --> 13:16.130
Since when do you let patients
participate in differentials?

13:16.380 --> 13:18.716
Since the patient and her doctor happen
to be the same person.

13:19.258 --> 13:21.010
<i>Your kidney function
is still declining.</i>

13:21.135 --> 13:22.052
<i>Means
you have a kidney problem.</i>

13:22.178 --> 13:25.639
But not one that needed antibiotics.
Makes us equally wrong.

13:25.764 --> 13:28.976
No.
Makes us both wrong. Not equally.

13:29.351 --> 13:30.895
You were at least
six wronger.

13:31.812 --> 13:33.772
They run a PPD
before you shipped out?

13:33.898 --> 13:35.774
<i>On me and everybody else here.
It's not TB.</i>

13:35.900 --> 13:37.651
<i>Excuse us a second.</i>

13:39.069 --> 13:40.821
Cancer explains
her symptoms.

13:40.946 --> 13:44.033
A tumor in her lung or kidney that threw
a clot to the other organ.

13:44.158 --> 13:47.578
And you're worried the tumor might
overhear, realize we're on to it.

13:47.703 --> 13:51.040
Cancer's a hard diagnosis for patients,
even when they're not in the South Pole.

13:51.165 --> 13:53.209
We should figure this out,
maybe bring Wilson in.

13:59.131 --> 14:01.258
<i>Obviously, you two think
I'm in bad shape.</i>

14:01.383 --> 14:03.594
- Only if you count the tumor.
- House.

14:03.719 --> 14:05.095
Probably
in your abdomen.

14:05.763 --> 14:07.598
<i>But you don't have any advanced
imaging equipment.</i>

14:07.723 --> 14:09.308
<i>You also don't have
a surgeon to biopsy it,</i>

14:09.433 --> 14:11.227
<i>any stains to use
on the slide,</i>

14:11.352 --> 14:13.229
<i>or an oncologist
to analyze it.</i>

14:14.104 --> 14:15.856
<i>I'm too far away
to hold her hand.</i>

14:16.732 --> 14:17.900
<i>I have cancer?</i>

14:18.567 --> 14:19.610
Possibly.

14:19.735 --> 14:23.989
Since the only imaging equipment you
have is x-ray, let's start there.

14:24.114 --> 14:26.158
X-ray your entire body.

14:26.408 --> 14:28.327
<i>I'll upload the images
when I'm done.</i>

14:32.164 --> 14:33.916
Good for you.

15:01.151 --> 15:02.861
HOUSE: She's annoying.

15:03.153 --> 15:06.657
Refused to take the antibiotics because
other people might need them.

15:06.782 --> 15:09.451
She said she cares
about other people?

15:09.577 --> 15:10.786
What a poser.

15:11.245 --> 15:12.830
KUB is clean.

15:12.955 --> 15:16.000
You don't like her
because she's a psychiatrist.

15:16.125 --> 15:19.336
Mmm, I'm a complicated man.
I loathe her for many reasons.

15:19.461 --> 15:21.380
Never before has a profession
been so decried

15:21.505 --> 15:23.465
by someone who
needed it so badly.

15:23.591 --> 15:26.802
You talk a lot of smack
about tranny hookers.

15:26.927 --> 15:28.637
Enlarged mediastinal node.

15:28.762 --> 15:29.805
- Lymphoma?
- Probably,

15:29.930 --> 15:31.890
but we can't confirm it
without a biopsy.

15:32.016 --> 15:33.517
We can't analyze
a biopsy without a stain.

15:33.642 --> 15:34.852
We can't biopsy.

15:34.977 --> 15:37.688
Since they don't have stains down there,
we need a substitute.

15:37.813 --> 15:41.317
She can't biopsy that node
without a surgical team and an OR.

15:41.442 --> 15:44.695
Anything with a strong color
could work as a stain.

15:45.237 --> 15:47.906
Printer ink,
food coloring, coffee.

15:48.157 --> 15:49.033
No, thanks.

15:49.158 --> 15:51.869
I'll find a node closer to the surface.
One she can biopsy.

15:52.411 --> 15:53.495
That makes sense.

15:53.621 --> 15:54.622
That makes sense?

15:54.747 --> 15:55.998
I said it first.

15:56.123 --> 15:58.292
In a shockingly
calm manner.

15:59.251 --> 16:02.212
After I've just been
jerking you around for 30 seconds

16:02.338 --> 16:04.923
without you complaining
or analyzing said jerking.

16:05.049 --> 16:06.216
I was being mature.

16:07.176 --> 16:08.510
In a lavender shirt.

16:09.136 --> 16:11.513
You, for some reason,
are happy.

16:11.639 --> 16:13.307
How dare you.

16:13.432 --> 16:15.517
The x-rays don't show
any other abnormal nodes.

16:15.643 --> 16:19.772
Abnormal nodes can be felt
before they can be seen on an x-ray.

16:20.189 --> 16:22.149
You're wearing
that shirt for someone.

16:22.274 --> 16:24.568
The Health Department.
They frown on topless oncology.

16:24.693 --> 16:26.111
You're gonna do
a physical?

16:26.236 --> 16:29.490
Have to. You and Foreman are going
to be here looking for a stain.

16:32.910 --> 16:35.871
I can do the physical.
There's no reason you need to watch.

16:36.246 --> 16:38.332
I can think of at least
three reasons.

16:38.457 --> 16:39.833
<i>One of them is medical.</i>

16:39.958 --> 16:41.919
Where are you?
Not in your office.

16:42.044 --> 16:44.046
You're not in the hospital.
No reason for me to be.

16:44.171 --> 16:47.257
I'm not undressing for you
in your apartment.

16:47.383 --> 16:48.509
<i>You're not in
my apartment.</i>

16:48.926 --> 16:51.637
You're three quarters
of a world away.

16:52.012 --> 16:53.514
<i>I promise not to get fresh.</i>

16:53.639 --> 16:55.099
I'm not taking off
my clothes.

16:55.891 --> 16:57.226
One of us has to.

17:02.106 --> 17:04.274
Show me your place.

17:06.694 --> 17:10.406
It's got walls, a floor,
and in some places, a roof.

17:10.531 --> 17:13.701
<i>I am not exposing myself
without some reciprocity.</i>

17:13.826 --> 17:15.411
It's my apartment.
It's not my soul.

17:20.874 --> 17:22.459
<i>Living room.</i>

17:23.460 --> 17:24.461
Slow down.

17:25.421 --> 17:26.463
<i>Huh!</i>

17:26.839 --> 17:29.633
Lots of books.
I'm betting all medical.

17:29.758 --> 17:33.345
<i>Only if you count Jenna Jameson's
autobiography as a gynecological text.</i>

17:33.470 --> 17:35.180
Fiction is a waste of time.

17:35.472 --> 17:37.099
Unless you can laugh
at it?

17:37.224 --> 17:39.393
<i>I love to laugh.
Moving on.</i>

17:41.437 --> 17:42.438
Back up.

<i>How bad is the insomnia?</i>

17:46.859 --> 17:47.901
<i>Let me quantify that.</i>

<i>Do you drink two or three scotches
before passing out in front of the TV?</i>

17:53.365 --> 17:55.075
You are so far off.

<i>It's bourbon.</i>

17:58.662 --> 18:00.205
<i>No photos anywhere.</i>

18:00.706 --> 18:02.291
Family and friends
aren't important?

18:03.584 --> 18:04.793
Well, you're sick.

18:04.918 --> 18:08.046
You have 20 people down the hall,
and you've had exactly one visitor.

18:08.172 --> 18:09.339
<i>I don't want
to panic anyone.</i>

18:09.465 --> 18:12.801
You don't like people.
You hide on that ice cube, so...

18:12.926 --> 18:18.557
<i>Stop projecting. You're antisocial,
so you assume I'm antisocial?</i>

18:18.682 --> 18:20.976
How about
if I just get naked, and you shut up?

18:21.101 --> 18:23.854
<i>If I thought I could get you naked,
I would have led with that.</i>

18:24.813 --> 18:27.191
<i>You'd rather show me
your soul than your leg.</i>

18:28.692 --> 18:31.528
Great. You got me
all figured out.

18:32.112 --> 18:33.822
You going to try
and fix me now?

18:34.573 --> 18:37.117
<i>I never said
you needed fixing.</i>

18:39.620 --> 18:42.080
He's letting her take part
in the differentials.

18:42.206 --> 18:44.708
Of course he is.
He likes her.

18:44.833 --> 18:48.462
Big shock. Spaghetti sauce doesn't work
as a lymph tissue stain.

18:49.296 --> 18:51.715
I'll try the coffee.

18:51.840 --> 18:54.843
He's annoyed by her, doesn't respect
her as a doctor,

18:54.968 --> 18:56.512
constantly
insults her.

18:56.637 --> 18:59.473
That's House's version
of courtship.

19:00.265 --> 19:02.434
Oh, God. He's been wooing me
for years.

19:02.559 --> 19:04.228
She's the perfect
woman for him.

19:04.353 --> 19:06.772
Willing to literally go to the end
of the earth for her career,

19:06.897 --> 19:09.691
making her unavailable
for a real relationship.

19:09.900 --> 19:12.110
And she's afflicted
with a mysterious illness.

19:12.402 --> 19:14.321
Soy sauce is a no-go.

19:15.113 --> 19:16.573
We're gonna be here
all night.

19:17.950 --> 19:19.409
How long
does it take you to get naked?

19:19.535 --> 19:21.286
<i>It's the South Pole.</i>

19:21.954 --> 19:23.288
(SHIVERING)
I wear a lot of layers.

19:25.290 --> 19:27.459
<i>Okay. Ready.</i>

19:27.584 --> 19:29.461
(GRUNTS) I saw socks.

19:29.586 --> 19:30.838
That's not naked.

19:30.963 --> 19:32.172
Have I mentioned
it's freezing here?

19:32.631 --> 19:36.844
<i>When they discover lymph nodes in feet,
I will take off my socks.</i>

19:37.469 --> 19:39.721
Use your right hand
to palpate the nodes.

19:40.430 --> 19:43.308
Any node you can feel
is the one we can biopsy.

19:43.433 --> 19:47.145
Let's start with your breasts,
move down to the ass, then...

19:47.271 --> 19:50.274
<i>I was thinking go from the neck
and work my way down.</i>

19:50.399 --> 19:52.317
We could,

19:52.442 --> 19:55.821
but I'd never forgive myself if we found
something before we got to your breasts.

19:57.239 --> 19:59.491
I'm starting with
the anterior cervical nodes.

20:05.497 --> 20:07.165
Turn your head.

20:07.291 --> 20:09.459
Locate the SCM muscle.

20:10.168 --> 20:12.296
<i>I know how to find
my lymph nodes.</i>

20:12.421 --> 20:16.425
Did they teach you that before or after
the class on fondling your inner child?

20:16.550 --> 20:18.302

20:18.427 --> 20:21.388
<i>No swelling.

<i>I can hear that, House.</i>

20:23.932 --> 20:25.684
<i>Just thought
it might help you relax.</i>

20:28.145 --> 20:29.813
Anything in
the axillary nodes?

20:30.480 --> 20:32.566
All clear.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.234
Both sides.

20:35.235 --> 20:38.155
Now slide your hand
to your sternum.

20:39.948 --> 20:43.994
Probe for nodes
moving slowly downward.

20:45.078 --> 20:46.455
<i>Down to what, House?</i>

20:46.580 --> 20:49.666
<i>Sorry. Can't hear you on account

Feel that node again.

21:03.722 --> 21:05.599
<i>It's swollen.</i>

21:07.893 --> 21:09.394
Looks like you're

22:20.132 --> 22:21.216
You've never asked me
that question,

22:39.443 --> 22:40.569
I thought you were

No. You are definitely
following me.

22:42.279 --> 22:43.697
- Where are you going?
- Out to lunch.

22:43.822 --> 22:44.990
You never go
out to lunch.

22:45.115 --> 22:46.575
Which means there's a reason
you're going out to lunch.

22:46.700 --> 22:48.368
I assume that reason
is a human being.

22:48.493 --> 22:49.786
Or a sandwich.

24:42.482 --> 24:45.152
Try increasing
the magnification on the camera.

24:45.277 --> 24:48.238
<i>You know, I emailed a couple of
colleagues at the hospital about you.</i>

24:48.363 --> 24:49.990
You're checking up
on me? Not House?

24:50.574 --> 24:55.871
Yeah, well House is straightforward,
brilliant and an ass.

24:55.996 --> 24:58.456
Two out of three good qualities.
Clear majority.

24:58.582 --> 25:02.252
Whereas you, on the other hand,
have a perfect score.

25:02.377 --> 25:06.173
You are responsible,
nice, human.

25:06.506 --> 25:08.258
And yet, you're House's
best friend.

25:08.675 --> 25:09.634
<i>Hold there.</i>

25:09.843 --> 25:12.596
Makes you think
he's secretly nicer than he seems?

25:12.721 --> 25:16.183
<i>Makes me think that you're secretly
a lot less nice than you seem.</i>

25:16.308 --> 25:17.726
<i>Do you always insult
your doctors?</i>

25:17.851 --> 25:21.563
It's not an insult. indiscriminate
niceness is overrated.

25:22.522 --> 25:24.566
No wonder he likes you.

25:27.485 --> 25:31.156
Based on this slide
you do not have cancer.

25:32.949 --> 25:34.492
(SIGHING) Oh!

25:34.618 --> 25:35.619
Thank God.

25:35.744 --> 25:37.787
I do see some inflammation,
which could mean...

25:37.913 --> 25:38.997
(EXCLAIMS IN PAIN)

25:39.122 --> 25:41.499
Cate?
You all right?

25:41.625 --> 25:43.501
My left side. It hurts.

25:43.793 --> 25:44.753
(WINCES)

25:45.337 --> 25:47.464
It's the same pain
that I had on the right.

25:47.589 --> 25:48.632
Your other kidney.

25:48.757 --> 25:51.885
No. I hope it's, it's something,
it's maybe...

25:52.010 --> 25:53.637
(EXCLAIMS IN PAIN)

25:54.137 --> 25:55.180
I'm screwed.

26:02.103 --> 26:05.523
<i>HOUSE: The bad news is you're O for two
in the kidney department.</i>

26:06.024 --> 26:09.277
ls there good news?
You're back at home.

26:10.153 --> 26:11.655
Of course.
There's cable.

26:12.322 --> 26:15.283
<i>- And freedom to work pant-free.</i>
- That is good news.

26:15.951 --> 26:18.912
Wilson found signs of inflammation
in your biopsy.

26:19.704 --> 26:22.374
That, plus the two failing kidneys,
points to autoimmune disease.

26:22.499 --> 26:25.710
Probably SLE or vasculitis.
Treatment for both is prednisone.

26:26.211 --> 26:27.337
Start with
a hundred milligrams.

26:27.462 --> 26:29.172
Autoimmune is just
your latest theory.

26:29.297 --> 26:32.133
Like cancer before that,
and a kidney stone before.

26:32.259 --> 26:35.762
<i>Take the prednisone. You'll get better.
That will be your confirmation.</i>

26:35.887 --> 26:38.181
You practice medicine
like it's a fire sale.

26:38.306 --> 26:40.642
You've wasted
antibiotics, x-rays...

26:40.767 --> 26:42.894
That was not a waste.
We've ruled out...

26:43.019 --> 26:44.562
We have a crew member here
who has asthma.

26:44.688 --> 26:48.650
If he has an episode after I've used up
the prednisone, he'll die.

26:48.775 --> 26:50.527
There's a good chance
he's going to die anyway.

26:50.652 --> 26:52.112
Since there won't be
a doctor there to help him.

26:52.237 --> 26:55.573
<i>(SLOWLY) Show me proof
that it's autoimmune,</i>

26:56.241 --> 26:58.285
<i>and then I'll take
the prednisone.</i>

27:03.790 --> 27:05.750
FOREMAN: We should
send her outside.

27:05.875 --> 27:08.837
Right. Let's just tell her to head north
until she runs into a hospital.

27:08.962 --> 27:12.048
Autoimmune diseases are basically
inflammation running wild.

27:12.173 --> 27:16.011
Extreme cold has been used as treatment,
like putting ice on a sprained ankle.

27:16.136 --> 27:19.014
She starts to feel better outside,
we know it's autoimmune.

27:19.139 --> 27:20.515
Is that my wallet?

27:20.640 --> 27:21.975
You can have it back.

27:22.100 --> 27:23.184
I've already been
through it.

27:23.768 --> 27:25.437
I like your
ice on the sprain metaphor.

27:25.562 --> 27:27.522
Makes it seem
like we're not killing her.

27:27.647 --> 27:29.274
She'd only need to be outside
five minutes.

27:29.399 --> 27:32.736
Without her mittens. Mom told me
that was a bad idea.

27:32.861 --> 27:36.281
Especially that winter. it was 70 below,
and I had dual kidney failure.

27:36.406 --> 27:40.827
This is a good idea. It's perfect
for you. Experimental, risky.

27:40.952 --> 27:42.495
Wilson's right.
You care about...

27:42.620 --> 27:45.290
You didn't touch the cash,
but you took the receipts?

27:48.335 --> 27:53.006
A hundred and ninety dollar restaurant
tab. That's dessert, probably booze.

27:53.131 --> 27:54.215
It means you lingered.

27:54.341 --> 27:57.427
Means it's at least
a third date. Means...

27:57.552 --> 27:59.429
- Where are you going?
- To talk to the people I pay

27:59.554 --> 28:00.889
to come up
with medical ideas.

28:01.014 --> 28:02.974
There are no ideas.

28:03.099 --> 28:04.726
The test for
autoimmune is ANA.

28:04.851 --> 28:06.770
Unless penguins poop immunoanalyzers...

28:06.895 --> 28:08.521
Before ANA testing,

28:08.646 --> 28:11.107
people had
autoimmune diseases.

28:11.232 --> 28:12.442
How did they know?

28:12.567 --> 28:14.402
- C3.
- Before that.

28:14.527 --> 28:18.073
LE Prep. But she doesn't have any
controlled pore glass beads.

28:18.198 --> 28:20.075
You don't need them.

28:24.871 --> 28:26.206
<i>HOUSE:
When you shake the test tube,</i>

28:26.331 --> 28:29.000
<i>the paperclip will damage
some of your blood cells.</i>

28:29.125 --> 28:30.502
<i>If you have
an autoimmune disease,</i>

28:30.627 --> 28:33.254
<i>your immune system will gorge itself
on the damaged cells.</i>

28:34.047 --> 28:36.508
They'll get big and fat so that you can
see them under a microscope.

28:37.509 --> 28:38.510
How you doing?

28:39.427 --> 28:41.054
<i>No change.</i>

28:41.179 --> 28:44.849
<i>So, how long should I give the cells
to fatten up before I check them?</i>

28:44.974 --> 28:46.476
A couple hours.

28:46.601 --> 28:48.978
Or you could stop being a hypocrite
and take the prednisone now.

28:49.104 --> 28:51.815
<i>Not bending to your will
makes me a hypocrite?</i>

28:51.940 --> 28:56.027
If your psych patients demanded lab
results you'd never make a diagnosis.

28:56.152 --> 28:57.112
So, I'm wrong.

28:57.237 --> 29:00.448
You sleep like a baby.
Your life is unfolding as you dreamed.

29:00.573 --> 29:02.492
Everyone is miserable.

29:02.617 --> 29:04.702
You don't change that
because people don't change.

29:04.828 --> 29:05.829
You want to believe that

29:05.954 --> 29:08.498
because then you're freed
from any responsibility for your misery.

29:08.623 --> 29:09.999
Oh, shut up.

29:10.917 --> 29:12.419
I get enough of this
from Wilson.

29:12.544 --> 29:14.045
And yet, you keep
hanging out with him.

29:15.922 --> 29:17.632
<i>And, from what I hear,</i>

29:17.757 --> 29:21.094
<i>you have spent more time with me
than with any other patient.</i>

29:24.973 --> 29:26.349
Sorry about that.

29:27.725 --> 29:29.018
Call me when you get
the results.

29:29.144 --> 29:30.645
(CLICKS OFF)

29:35.942 --> 29:37.318
How's your patient?

29:37.902 --> 29:39.821
She has an
autoimmune disease.

29:39.946 --> 29:41.906
Tell the psych department
she's in denial.

29:44.367 --> 29:46.035
I had to fire Cameron.

29:46.161 --> 29:48.204
What? What happened?

29:48.329 --> 29:51.875
A sixty-five-year-old man came
into the ER with a hip fracture.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.960
Cameron gave him
Demerol.

29:54.085 --> 29:55.420
The guy was
on an MAOI.

29:55.545 --> 29:57.005
Put him into
a hypertensive crisis.

29:57.380 --> 29:59.757
- Is he going to live?
- Taub caught the error in time.

30:00.425 --> 30:02.051
If she'd just admitted
the mistake,

30:02.177 --> 30:04.387
maybe I could have just
suspended her, but...

30:04.971 --> 30:07.599
She's packing up.
If you want to say goodbye.

30:07.724 --> 30:10.018
We should be hearing from the South Pole
in a few minutes.

30:10.768 --> 30:11.811
That's it?

30:12.729 --> 30:14.022
There's nothing
to be done.

30:14.147 --> 30:17.066
She screwed up. She's got
no one to blame but herself.

30:20.403 --> 30:22.030
I've got to go
talk to Cameron.

30:22.155 --> 30:23.573
Cuddy wouldn't can her
for one screw-up.

30:23.698 --> 30:25.700
And if she did,
she wouldn't come to me.

30:25.825 --> 30:28.077
And if she did, she wouldn't open with,
"How's your patient?"

30:28.203 --> 30:29.913
- And if she did...
- Why would she lie?

30:30.038 --> 30:31.998
Timeless question.

30:32.123 --> 30:34.834
In this case, she conspired
with your co-workers to teach me

30:34.959 --> 30:37.045
that some things
are more important than cable.

30:37.170 --> 30:39.047
I'm going to have to teach them
that they're wrong.

30:39.172 --> 30:42.258
Come on. South Pole really
should be calling.

30:45.470 --> 30:48.973
LE Prep test was negative.
It's not autoimmune.

30:49.432 --> 30:53.520
You're basing that on a test done with
a paper clip. Just take the prednisone.

30:53.811 --> 30:57.065
Either find another diagnosis,
or find another test.

30:57.190 --> 30:59.067
(SIGHS) There is one way.

30:59.442 --> 31:04.155
You can take this experimental drug
called prednisone.

31:04.906 --> 31:06.157
<i>If your kidneys
start working...</i>

31:06.282 --> 31:08.117
<i>FOREMAN: There is
another test.</i>

31:10.119 --> 31:12.789
I think Foreman may have just
broken up, there.

31:12.914 --> 31:15.792
What he actually said was,
"There is no other test."

31:15.917 --> 31:17.168
<i>FOREMAN: If you have
an autoimmune disease,</i>

31:17.293 --> 31:19.963
exposure to the cold should decrease
your kidney pain.

31:20.088 --> 31:23.007
<i>If I go outside,
we'll have our answer?</i>

31:23.758 --> 31:24.926
<i>And you knew about this?</i>

31:25.051 --> 31:27.637
I rejected it because
if you're frozen solid,

31:27.762 --> 31:29.639
<i>it's hard to get the needles
into your arms.</i>

31:29.764 --> 31:31.224
How long do I need
to stay out?

31:31.349 --> 31:32.392
At least five minutes.

31:32.517 --> 31:35.186
Eight minutes outside
would kill a healthy person.

31:35.311 --> 31:37.146
<i>And healthy people
don't suck on oxygen masks.</i>

31:37.272 --> 31:38.565
<i>Healthy people can pee.</i>

31:38.690 --> 31:40.608
I'll go get Sean,
have him come with me.

31:40.733 --> 31:43.027
Just take the prednisone.

31:43.152 --> 31:44.153
<i>Once I come inside,</i>

31:45.196 --> 31:46.990
if it's autoimmune.

31:50.952 --> 31:52.954
Are you all right?

31:54.038 --> 31:56.291
(COLLAPSING) Oh, I'm sure
she's just fine.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.418
Cate?

32:00.169 --> 32:02.839
Do you know if there's anyone down there
who has a cell phone?

32:18.813 --> 32:21.232
FOREMAN: it took the station mechanic
20 minutes to respond.

32:21.941 --> 32:23.234
She'd already slipped
into a coma.

32:23.359 --> 32:25.403
Started her on prednisone,
but no improvement.

32:26.529 --> 32:28.114
Means it's not
autoimmune.

32:29.073 --> 32:30.992
Good thing
she's in a coma.

32:31.117 --> 32:33.661
- Or we'd have to listen to her gloat.
- And where are we going?

32:33.786 --> 32:35.622
To find the useful
members of my team.

32:35.747 --> 32:36.998
You're letting them
off the hook?

32:37.123 --> 32:40.877
You happy? Because of you, I'm not gonna
be able to watch Law <i>& Order</i> in Korean.

32:41.002 --> 32:42.045
Why am I here?

32:42.170 --> 32:44.756
Because I want to ask you
about your girlfriend.

32:45.048 --> 32:47.383
I must know who she is,
or you'd have told me her name.

32:47.508 --> 32:50.762
She doesn't have a name.
It's some sort of birth defect.

32:50.887 --> 32:52.972
There's only about
12 people we both know.

32:53.097 --> 32:54.724
And I can't remember
five of their names,

32:54.849 --> 32:57.977
so we're down to Cuddy,
your ex-wives.

32:58.102 --> 32:59.646
Your mama.

33:00.563 --> 33:02.857
WILSON: You need to run
a kidney function test.

33:02.982 --> 33:06.110
Yes. If only she wasn't in a coma, we
could get her to run a test

33:06.235 --> 33:07.695
to find out why
she's in a coma.

33:07.820 --> 33:10.156
The results
would likely be paradoxical.

33:10.448 --> 33:13.159
It can't be Cuddy, because you're
straight. it can't be...

33:13.284 --> 33:15.286
We could talk the mechanic
through the test.

33:15.411 --> 33:16.913
Too complicated.

33:20.291 --> 33:21.918
Unless he's thirsty.

33:25.004 --> 33:26.047
Drink her urine?

33:26.172 --> 33:27.882
If it has a strong,
concentrated taste,

33:28.007 --> 33:29.634
it means the problems
are in her kidneys.

33:29.759 --> 33:31.594
<i>Watery taste means
it's her brain.</i>

33:33.763 --> 33:36.599
- And then you can fix it?
- Let's say, yeah.

33:38.267 --> 33:39.394
<i>How do I get
the urine out of her?</i>

33:39.519 --> 33:40.853
Take a straight catheter
and insert it...

33:40.978 --> 33:42.563
Those are your
only questions?

33:43.398 --> 33:45.525
Not, "Is it safe?"

33:45.817 --> 33:47.860
<i>Or, "ls there
another way?"</i>

33:47.985 --> 33:50.071
Or, "Are you
out of your minds?"

33:50.697 --> 33:51.906
You wouldn't
ask me if...

33:52.031 --> 33:53.533
Wait a second.

33:54.659 --> 33:55.910
You're in love
with her.

33:56.869 --> 34:00.123
That explains why you're so eager to get
her naked, then have a drink.

34:00.248 --> 34:02.333
Because most guys like to go
the other way around.

34:02.458 --> 34:04.085
Why do you care
how I feel about her?

34:05.795 --> 34:10.007
Because now I know that I can get you
to do anything to save her.

34:12.510 --> 34:14.178
Tell him how
to tap the keg.

34:18.141 --> 34:20.560
You got Cameron fired.

34:20.685 --> 34:22.186
Cuddy wasn't supposed
to find out.

34:22.311 --> 34:23.980
No kidding!

34:24.105 --> 34:27.775
Get me cable. How tough can that be?
You cost a woman her job.

34:28.401 --> 34:31.320
There's only one thing
you can say to keep me from firing you.

34:31.446 --> 34:34.198
- Cameron wasn't fired. We...
- Wrong.

34:35.867 --> 34:37.618
- You know?
- We're still fired?

34:37.744 --> 34:40.455
That should be a hint
as to what you're supposed to say.

34:40.580 --> 34:42.415
- We're sorry.
- Wrong.

34:42.540 --> 34:43.875
I love you.

34:44.625 --> 34:45.710
Wrong.

34:46.335 --> 34:49.046
This is a game? First, we have to screw
with our co-worker,

34:49.172 --> 34:51.215
now we have to try
to figure out what you want us to say?

34:51.340 --> 34:53.050
This is insane.
I'm not playing.

34:54.051 --> 34:55.136
Right.

34:56.387 --> 34:58.181
You should have said this
two days ago.

34:59.474 --> 35:01.142
(EMPHASIZING) Do not
play games with me.

35:01.267 --> 35:04.395
Number one, you are going to lose.
You're just not ready.

35:04.520 --> 35:07.857
Number two, the game was to force you
to stop playing games.

35:07.982 --> 35:10.568
I need you to stand up
to me. Challenge me.

35:10.693 --> 35:13.029
I need you to stop worrying
about getting fired.

35:13.362 --> 35:15.281
And go pay for my cable.

35:16.157 --> 35:17.033
No!

35:18.075 --> 35:19.660
I didn't mean on this.

35:20.703 --> 35:22.079
Seriously.
I need cable.

35:32.131 --> 35:33.549
Milk, milk,
lemonade.

35:37.011 --> 35:39.138
(GAGGING) It tastes
kind of watery.

35:40.181 --> 35:41.474
That's bad news.

35:41.599 --> 35:43.601
Either increased
intracranial pressure

35:43.726 --> 35:46.062
or something's wrong
with her hypothalamus.

35:46.187 --> 35:47.647
<i>How do you figure out
which one it is?</i>

35:47.772 --> 35:49.649
We don't do anything.

35:51.567 --> 35:53.569
You're gonna drill
a hole in her skull.

35:55.112 --> 35:59.283
<i>If she regains consciousness,
it's increased intracranial pressure.</i>

36:01.077 --> 36:02.119
And if it's
the other thing?

36:02.245 --> 36:03.746
She'll die.

36:03.871 --> 36:05.748
But if it's the hypothalamus,
she's dead, anyway.

36:07.250 --> 36:11.003
If the problem is the pressure
in her brain, and I fix it,

36:11.128 --> 36:12.255
is she going
to be all better?

36:12.547 --> 36:15.800
No, but it'll give us more time
to figure out what's wrong.

36:17.009 --> 36:19.011
<i>I have to get someone else.
I can't do this.</i>

36:21.389 --> 36:23.015
You love her.

36:23.641 --> 36:26.060
You'd do anything
to save her.

36:26.185 --> 36:27.353
Not this.

36:27.478 --> 36:29.397
I can't do this.

36:29.522 --> 36:31.399
If she dies because of something
that I did, then I...

36:31.524 --> 36:33.067
Listen. Listen.

36:33.192 --> 36:36.153
I am not going
to let you hurt her. Okay?

36:37.071 --> 36:40.283
Now, please. This is
her only chance.

36:47.039 --> 36:48.082
Okay-

36:56.090 --> 36:57.800
That was easy.

37:01.095 --> 37:03.431
SEAN: Okay. Her head
is stabilized,

37:04.223 --> 37:06.559
and the drill bit
is sterile.

37:06.684 --> 37:09.854
Place the drill bit against the upper
left part of her forehead,

37:09.979 --> 37:11.105
about an inch
above the temple.

37:14.025 --> 37:15.526
<i>(WHIRRING)</i>

37:29.206 --> 37:30.374
It's not going
anywhere.

37:30.499 --> 37:32.126
Bone's harder than wood.
Lean into it.

37:32.752 --> 37:34.337
<i>The skull is only
a quarter inch thick.</i>

37:34.462 --> 37:37.298
Once you're midway through,
drill in shorter bursts.

37:37.423 --> 37:39.342
<i>If you come out the other side,
you've gone too far.</i>

37:43.262 --> 37:44.513
Okay. Now, what?
Now, what?

37:45.014 --> 37:45.973
Let the fluid drain.

37:57.234 --> 37:58.736
(GROANING)

37:59.695 --> 38:00.947
She's waking up.
She's waking up.

38:11.123 --> 38:12.333
(WEAKLY) Sean?

38:13.918 --> 38:15.628
What's going on?

38:18.881 --> 38:21.217
HOUSE: South Pole doc
is out of her coma,

38:21.425 --> 38:23.344
and now we have
a new symptom.

38:23.552 --> 38:26.180
Increased intracranial
pressure.

38:26.639 --> 38:28.140
Why are we
out here?

38:28.265 --> 38:29.850
That's the
patient room.

38:30.309 --> 38:33.938
ICP plus kidney problems
plus lung collapse equals...

38:34.063 --> 38:36.273
The most likely suspect
is a tumor throwing off clots.

38:36.399 --> 38:37.608
We ruled out cancer.

38:37.733 --> 38:38.985
But not clots.

38:39.318 --> 38:40.778
What causes
blood clots?

38:40.903 --> 38:42.154
Bacterial endocarditis.

38:42.279 --> 38:43.364
Not without a fever.

38:43.489 --> 38:45.616
Deep vein thrombosis
plus an existing PFO.

38:45.741 --> 38:48.703
PFO would have been discovered on her
pre-South Pole physical exam.

38:48.828 --> 38:49.996
What if the clots
aren't clots?

38:51.205 --> 38:54.333
Atherosclerosis. Fatty plaque builds up
on the arterial walls.

38:54.458 --> 38:57.545
Pieces break off, block blood flow.
Explains everything.

38:57.670 --> 39:01.632
She has zero risk factors.
Forget fat. Think clots.

39:01.757 --> 39:02.842
No.

39:04.885 --> 39:07.304
- You're standing up to me?
- Maybe.

39:07.430 --> 39:10.099
Just to clarify, you should do that
when you're right.

39:10.224 --> 39:11.851
Sorry for the confusion.

39:11.976 --> 39:13.686
- How could a clot...
- Could be a different kind of fat.

39:13.811 --> 39:15.396
Fat emboli.

39:16.272 --> 39:19.775
It's a perfect fit. Except it's
completely impossible.

39:20.776 --> 39:23.237
Fat emboli requires
an un-repaired bone breakage.

39:23.362 --> 39:25.781
Between the x-ray
and the exam, I've seen her entire...

39:34.457 --> 39:36.125
See, that's what
I'm talking about.

39:39.170 --> 39:40.796
<i>Take off her socks.</i>

39:42.131 --> 39:43.382
I can...
I can do it.

39:43.507 --> 39:44.759
No. I got it.

39:55.394 --> 39:57.021
Your toe is broken.

39:58.397 --> 39:59.899
Oh, my God.

40:00.274 --> 40:02.985
<i>HOUSE: Bits of bone marrow have been
leaking into your bloodstream.</i>

40:03.110 --> 40:07.448
<i>Those fat emboli have caused blockages
in your kidney, lungs, and brain.</i>

40:08.407 --> 40:09.283
It doesn't even hurt.

40:09.408 --> 40:11.243
<i>Cold numbs everything.</i>

40:11.368 --> 40:13.954
Does a particularly great job
on the extremities.

40:14.080 --> 40:17.416
You'll need to close the break to stop
the marrow from leaking.

40:17.541 --> 40:18.959
This one
you will feel.

40:20.002 --> 40:21.545
<i>Will you do it?</i>

40:22.379 --> 40:25.091
He drilled a hole in your
skull after drinking your pee.

40:25.216 --> 40:26.550
<i>I think he's up for this.</i>

40:26.675 --> 40:28.427
Grab the tip of her toe
with your right hand.

40:28.552 --> 40:30.346
Hold the break
with the other.

40:30.471 --> 40:31.931
On the count of three,
pull hard.

40:33.557 --> 40:35.226
<i>One, two,</i>

40:35.601 --> 40:36.936
three.

40:37.061 --> 40:38.354
(SCREAMS)

40:46.195 --> 40:48.614
Splint your toe.
You'll be fine.

40:53.786 --> 40:55.496
Thank you, House.

40:56.831 --> 41:00.251
Don't thank me.
He's the one who saved your life.

41:27.820 --> 41:29.488
He likes her.

41:37.872 --> 41:41.500
A bottle of the Bordeaux
and some sparkling water.

41:46.964 --> 41:50.718
Well, you didn't pick her up,
which means she's coming from work, too,

41:50.843 --> 41:52.761
which means you're
comfortable enough to meet her.

41:52.887 --> 41:55.014
Damn. I thought I lost you
when l walked backwards

41:55.139 --> 41:56.473
through my own
footprints in the snow.

41:56.599 --> 41:59.643
I think I've got it narrowed down
to three possibilities.

41:59.768 --> 42:01.729
Better leave. If you see her,
it'll be cheating.

42:01.854 --> 42:03.147
It's not one
of your ex-wives.

42:03.272 --> 42:04.398
Because they hate me.

42:04.523 --> 42:07.568
They don't. They should,
but they don't. I called them.

42:07.693 --> 42:10.237
It's someone new,
but someone I know.

42:10.362 --> 42:12.239
Did you ever consider
being happy for me?

42:12.364 --> 42:13.616
Briefly.

42:13.741 --> 42:16.118
You ordering the wine
before she got here...

42:17.369 --> 42:20.289
Girls are good, House,
and you know it.

42:20.414 --> 42:23.042
You solved your case
because you cared about that girl.

42:23.167 --> 42:26.337
You're demonstrating
the illusion of manly confidence,

42:26.462 --> 42:28.380
which means you haven't
closed the deal, yet.

42:28.505 --> 42:30.633
I closed the deal.
I just like her.

42:30.758 --> 42:31.884
Still?

42:32.009 --> 42:34.428
You knew your patient
hated having cold feet,

42:34.553 --> 42:38.098
because you did a physical exam,
because you liked her.

42:38.474 --> 42:42.519
Your theory is I cared,
therefore I let her keep her socks on.

42:42.645 --> 42:45.189
If that's what love is, then I don't
wanna have anything to do with it.

42:45.314 --> 42:48.067
It starts with warm feet,
but leads to other things.

42:48.192 --> 42:49.860
Your mom and I will explain
when you're older.

42:49.985 --> 42:53.113
If I'd made her take them off like I
should have, I'd have seen the toe

42:53.239 --> 42:54.365
and solved the case
days ago.

42:54.490 --> 42:55.950
But you don't
care about her.

42:56.075 --> 43:00.162
Of course not.
House doesn't care about anyone.

43:02.623 --> 43:04.250
Hi.

43:04.375 --> 43:05.584
Sorry I'm late.

43:07.503 --> 43:09.463
Cutthroat Bitch?

43:10.172 --> 43:14.260
I call her Amber.
Was she on your list?
