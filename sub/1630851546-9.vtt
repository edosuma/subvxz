00:10.488 --> 00:12.229
does not mean that
we have no leads.

And this, well, isn't typical.
It's supern...

00:39.909 --> 00:42.085

This is ridiculous.

to ask the Copperhead himself.

I'm a suspect
in a murder investigation.

03:36.041 --> 03:37.608
My boyfriend and I
were celebrating

03:37.652 --> 03:39.610
our one-year
anniversary.

03:39.654 --> 03:41.569
We took his
parents' sailboat

03:41.612 --> 03:43.397
out in the harbor
for the day.

03:43.440 --> 03:46.443
We were partying
with another boat.

03:47.618 --> 03:49.664
One minute, the
sun is shining,

03:49.707 --> 03:51.709
and the next minute,
it's sunset,

03:51.753 --> 03:54.930
and Anthony is dead.

03:54.973 --> 03:57.454
His body dragging
behind the sailboat,

03:57.498 --> 03:59.456
caught in one of
the boat lines.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.545
Oh, my God.

04:01.589 --> 04:06.115
Okay, so, the-the investigation
is open and you're a suspect?

04:06.158 --> 04:07.899
Do the police know
you fled to Maine?

04:07.943 --> 04:09.814
They haven't charged me yet.

04:09.858 --> 04:11.773
And it's not
technically fleeing.

04:11.816 --> 04:13.122
I read about
the crazy mysteries

04:13.165 --> 04:15.951
you guys have solved
on @NancyDrewsNews.

04:15.994 --> 04:18.432
And I came across
the Fan fan site.

04:18.475 --> 04:20.608
George lost time when
Odette was in control.

04:20.651 --> 04:23.132
What if I'm possessed?
What if this thing inside me

04:23.175 --> 04:25.047
wants to kill somebody else
that I care about again?

04:25.090 --> 04:26.744
I've lost time before
this boat trip.

04:26.788 --> 04:28.703
Usually for just
a few minutes, but

04:28.746 --> 04:31.575
if this spirit inside me is
getting stronger, then that

04:31.619 --> 04:33.142
would explain...Okay, so, Odette

04:33.185 --> 04:36.667
became entwined with George
when she died,

04:36.711 --> 04:39.104
and Nancy had to use
a mystical shroud

04:39.148 --> 04:41.846
to-to bring her back
to life.

04:41.890 --> 04:45.807
Have you been
mystically resuscitated lately?

04:45.850 --> 04:48.505
Just because I haven't had
any near-death experiences

04:48.549 --> 04:50.115
doesn't mean
I'm not possessed.

04:50.159 --> 04:51.900
I was the only one
on that boat,

04:51.943 --> 04:54.032
and I know the cops
are gonna say that I did this.

04:54.076 --> 04:56.818
And if I did, possession
is the only explanation.

04:56.861 --> 04:58.646
NICK:
Okay, possessed or not,

04:58.689 --> 05:01.649
let's just figure out if you
actually killed Anthony first.

05:03.172 --> 05:05.217
Yeah.

05:06.262 --> 05:07.481
NANCY: Hey!

05:07.524 --> 05:09.134
We came right over.We?

05:09.178 --> 05:11.049
Ah. Becausethe FBI

05:11.093 --> 05:13.748
is notoriously open-minded
about ghosts.

05:13.791 --> 05:16.011
People say they see Hoover
in the building all the time.

05:16.054 --> 05:17.882
Really?No.

05:17.926 --> 05:19.536
Okay.

05:19.580 --> 05:21.886
Well, for the last two
weeks, this building

05:21.930 --> 05:23.671
has shown signs
of a haunting.

05:23.714 --> 05:25.760
And with each haunted event
caught on the cameras,

05:25.803 --> 05:27.544
there's a supernatural glitch

05:27.588 --> 05:30.286
hiding an audio frequency. I
deciphered said audio frequency

05:30.330 --> 05:32.810
and found a distinctly
female voice

05:32.854 --> 05:34.029
on the recording.
That's point two.

05:34.072 --> 05:35.509
Ace, that's incredible.Thank you.

05:35.552 --> 05:37.337
What did the voice say?

05:38.555 --> 05:41.123
WOMAN:
Die. Die.

05:41.166 --> 05:43.517
Okay, that ghost
is telling you to die.

05:43.560 --> 05:44.953
Is there a point three?Yeah.

05:44.996 --> 05:46.258
I scrubbed through
all the security footage

05:46.302 --> 05:49.174
and I found the day that
it began. November 27th.

05:49.218 --> 05:50.698
That's the night that Temperance
returned to Horseshoe Bay.

05:50.741 --> 05:52.047
And we know that she has
a fraught relationship

05:52.090 --> 05:53.657
with her daughter Charity...Yeah.

05:53.701 --> 05:56.094
So maybe Temperance's return
stirred up Charity's spirit.

05:56.138 --> 05:58.270
Interesting
but circumstantial.

05:58.314 --> 06:00.751
Well, then allow me
to present point four:

06:00.795 --> 06:02.231
the first
supernatural event.

06:02.274 --> 06:04.189
The night Temperance
came back to town.

06:04.233 --> 06:06.714
Keep your eye on that
paperweight on Hannah's desk.

06:06.757 --> 06:08.890
Power goes out,
glass turns clear.

06:08.933 --> 06:10.848
Like a signal.

06:10.892 --> 06:12.284
Hmm.

06:14.939 --> 06:17.159
Six roses.
The symbol for Women in White.

06:17.202 --> 06:18.726
Charity Hudson
was a Woman in White,

06:18.769 --> 06:20.554
so it can't be a coincidence.
It has to be Charity.

06:20.597 --> 06:21.990
It's like our brain's
the same brain.

06:22.033 --> 06:24.558
How exactly can a ghost exist
if its soul was divided

06:24.601 --> 06:26.951
into four pieces before death
and two of those pieces

06:26.995 --> 06:29.301
are still intact
in living human beings?

06:29.345 --> 06:31.173
NANCY: That's a good question.It would be a better question

06:31.216 --> 06:32.740
if the premise wasn't flawed.

06:32.783 --> 06:34.742
Agent Park
presumes that

06:34.785 --> 06:37.875
ghosts and souls are the same.
My experience has shown that

06:37.919 --> 06:39.703
hauntings do include souls,

06:39.747 --> 06:42.097
but also Viking gods,
demons, ghost loops.

06:42.140 --> 06:44.055
Residual hauntings,
like Agnes Marvin

06:44.099 --> 06:46.275
in the Captain's cottage.Exactly. Not all

06:46.318 --> 06:48.103
paranormal events
are tied to souls.PARK: But you yourself

06:48.146 --> 06:49.800
said Charity's spirit
was disturbed

06:49.844 --> 06:51.759
by Temperance's arrival in town.

06:51.802 --> 06:54.022
Yeah, it was a literary
flourish. "There are more things

06:54.065 --> 06:55.632
in Heaven and Earth,"
Agent Park.

06:56.677 --> 06:59.897
Okay. Uh, how do we get Charity
on the tip line?

06:59.941 --> 07:01.856
Well, uh, there's just
one thing. Remember how

07:01.899 --> 07:04.902
nor'easters in Horseshoe Bay
blow restless spirits ashore?

07:04.946 --> 07:06.208
Mm-hmm.I'm sorry, what?

07:06.251 --> 07:08.863
With all the icy
weather incoming...

07:08.906 --> 07:11.866
WOMAN: Die. Die.[various voices chattering]

07:13.998 --> 07:16.000
Charity's not
the only one here.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.395
BESS:
Okay,

07:19.439 --> 07:22.877
typically, when a mysterious
woman shows up from a man's past

07:22.920 --> 07:26.402
with a tragic backstory asking
for help, it never goes well.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.317
I mean, come on, possession?

07:28.360 --> 07:29.623
Okay.It just doesn't add up.

07:29.666 --> 07:31.799
Look, I agree,
but let's at least find out

07:31.842 --> 07:33.931
how Eve's boyfriend
wound up dead in the water

07:33.975 --> 07:35.716
before diving into
the possibility of possession.Okay.

07:35.759 --> 07:37.979
I know I sound crazy.

07:38.022 --> 07:41.199
You should try to prove
that I killed Anthony knowingly.

07:41.243 --> 07:42.984
I'm serious.
Follow your gut.

07:43.027 --> 07:45.769
The evidence will prove
that I'm possessed.[phone dings]

Would you like a new event
created for your gut?

07:47.728 --> 07:49.643

07:56.476 --> 07:58.303
Nature calling.

08:01.959 --> 08:03.221
[coughs]

08:03.265 --> 08:04.745
[loudly]: Every time I
think I hear Charity,

08:04.788 --> 08:06.137
another voice will sh...

I think I hear Charity,

08:09.706 --> 08:11.360

So we need a way
to amplify the signal.

08:14.319 --> 08:15.756
Like a totem.
Something that

08:15.799 --> 08:17.322
she touched the day she died.

08:19.237 --> 08:20.500
Her wedding ring.Her wedding ring.

08:22.240 --> 08:24.329
So, the Copperhead...

08:24.373 --> 08:26.767
hung onto Charity's doll
for over 150 years,

08:26.810 --> 08:29.117
and he kept this chest

08:29.160 --> 08:30.988
in the cell with him.

08:31.032 --> 08:32.773
No wedding ring.

08:32.816 --> 08:34.165
Time for plan B.

08:34.209 --> 08:35.427
Uh, creepy,

08:35.471 --> 08:37.125
secret underground cage.

08:38.909 --> 08:40.041
I'll get our coats.

08:40.084 --> 08:44.001
[ringtone playing]

08:44.045 --> 08:45.481
Ace's phone.Our phones are always

08:45.525 --> 08:46.961
listening to us, right?

08:47.004 --> 08:49.877
Well, mine just
gave me an idea.

08:49.920 --> 08:53.054
I need to know how
to access passive recordings.

08:53.097 --> 08:54.229
Well, the recordings
are only gonna be, like,

08:54.272 --> 08:56.100
a minute long, at most.

08:56.144 --> 08:59.800
Unrelated: you've spent
some time with Agent Park?

08:59.843 --> 09:02.019
He showed up here with Nancy.Hmm.

09:02.063 --> 09:03.499
Hmm?Yeah,

09:03.543 --> 09:06.894
you know that hot, stuffy
feeling you have right now?

09:06.937 --> 09:08.417
That might be because
the window for you and Nancy

09:08.460 --> 09:10.898
is closing and you're
finally realizing it.

09:10.941 --> 09:13.074
Who said I had windows or...

09:13.117 --> 09:14.336
feelings?

09:14.379 --> 09:16.425
I know you.
I'm your platanchor.

09:16.468 --> 09:19.515
Anyway, can you text me
those instructions? Okay, bye.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.778

Wh...

09:28.306 --> 09:30.091
NANCY:
Ace, what's going on?

09:30.134 --> 09:32.049
The door's sealed.
I can't open it.

09:40.014 --> 09:41.972
PARK:
Ace, are you okay?

09:43.147 --> 09:45.149
[glass shatters]

09:53.549 --> 09:55.246
NANCY: Ace.

09:55.290 --> 09:56.596
Ace!

10:07.389 --> 10:09.391
[static]

10:10.479 --> 10:12.133
Okay, well, I'm sure
he'll get the hatch open.

10:12.176 --> 10:13.525
He's very resourceful.

10:13.569 --> 10:15.049
Meanwhile, since
we're stuck down here,

10:15.092 --> 10:17.094
want to go look at the cell?

10:19.314 --> 10:20.968
There has to be something
of Charity's.

10:21.011 --> 10:22.491
How have we found
nothing yet?

10:22.534 --> 10:24.798
All right, think.
Think, think, think.

10:24.841 --> 10:28.149
Okay, the Copperhead's mission
was tied to Charity.

10:28.192 --> 10:29.324
He split her soul
so that Temperance

10:29.367 --> 10:30.673
could never reunite with her.

10:30.717 --> 10:32.153
And he hated Temperance,
just like his mother did.

10:32.196 --> 10:34.895
He let Cora
turn him into a monster

10:34.938 --> 10:37.332
so that he could
carry out her plan,

10:37.375 --> 10:40.074
and then he waited here,

10:40.117 --> 10:42.511
living off of rats...
Hmm.

10:42.554 --> 10:43.947
[thud]

10:49.170 --> 10:51.041
Got something?

10:51.085 --> 10:52.434
Yeah.

10:52.477 --> 10:54.175
Yeah, there's a symbol

10:54.218 --> 10:55.959
on the ceiling--
could have been left

10:56.003 --> 10:58.005
by Cora Dow
or the Women in White.

10:58.048 --> 11:01.182
But this metalwork is the same
type as the-the padlock

11:01.225 --> 11:03.967
and that broken key
that we found.

11:04.011 --> 11:05.360
So maybe this
is the business end.

11:05.403 --> 11:06.491
Good find.

11:06.535 --> 11:08.624
But the key
didn't belong to Charity,

11:08.668 --> 11:10.408
so it won't work as a totem.

11:11.888 --> 11:13.934
We need something
that belonged to her

11:13.977 --> 11:15.457
so that we can ask her ghost

11:15.500 --> 11:17.328
where the last two pieces
of her soul are.

11:17.372 --> 11:19.113
And if we can't do that,
then two more people

11:19.156 --> 11:20.636
will die supernatural deaths,
and I'm the only one

11:20.680 --> 11:22.203
that can do anything about that,

11:22.246 --> 11:23.987
and the whole town
is counting on me,

11:24.031 --> 11:26.033
and the only way that I...Have you ever been in love?

11:30.298 --> 11:31.865
That's off-topic.

11:31.908 --> 11:33.431
I'm sorry,
are you just

11:33.475 --> 11:35.477
gonna sit there and do nothing?
Because, for all we know,

11:35.520 --> 11:37.087
the only reason the Copperhead
isn't here right now

11:37.131 --> 11:38.393
is because he's out there,

11:38.436 --> 11:40.569
freezing another heart.When an investigation

11:40.612 --> 11:44.051
hits a wall, the best thing
you can do is nothing.

11:44.094 --> 11:46.444
Sit in the discomfort of
not knowing the way forward.

11:46.488 --> 11:48.098
Clear your mind.

11:49.099 --> 11:50.274
Give it a try.

11:54.278 --> 11:57.064
This better lead
to an amazing epiphany.

12:01.111 --> 12:03.026
Are you meditating?

12:03.070 --> 12:05.899
I'm imagining what it was
like to be Beckett Dow.

12:05.942 --> 12:09.598
Alone in an iron cage
for over 150 years.

12:11.295 --> 12:13.645
You're shivering.

12:13.689 --> 12:15.560
Yeah, I mean, the-the air flow
in these tunnels

12:15.604 --> 12:18.085
makes it feel like we're
outside in Arctic temperatures,

12:18.128 --> 12:20.130
so of course I'm shivering.

12:21.349 --> 12:23.351
Not gonna let you
freeze to death.

12:27.137 --> 12:28.922
Clear your mind.

12:28.965 --> 12:31.489
Why would Beckett Dow
choose to imprison himself?

12:31.533 --> 12:34.188
Wait, what do you mean,
imprison himself?

12:36.451 --> 12:37.974
Take a look at these
bolts on the bottom.

12:38.018 --> 12:39.628
They're a different
shape than the bolts

12:39.671 --> 12:41.456
on the rest of the cell
and they're on the inside.

12:41.499 --> 12:42.631
This section of metal here--

12:42.674 --> 12:44.415
the finish is
slightly different.

12:46.330 --> 12:49.420
The cage was completed
from the inside.

12:49.464 --> 12:52.206
He didn't trust anyone else
to lock him inside this cage.

12:52.249 --> 12:53.729
He had to do it himself.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.340
Hatred can drive a man
to do a lot of things.

12:56.384 --> 12:58.516
But Beckett didn't
hate Temperance.

12:58.560 --> 13:00.257
His mother did.

13:00.301 --> 13:02.564
Somebody else's hate doesn't
make you seal yourself

13:02.607 --> 13:05.480
inside your own tomb.

13:05.523 --> 13:06.611
Well, what does?

13:07.656 --> 13:09.397
Love?But Temperance said it was

13:09.440 --> 13:11.616
Cora's ritual that turned
Beckett into the Copperhead,

13:11.660 --> 13:13.444
so he couldn't have
done that on his own.

13:13.488 --> 13:15.098
Who says he did it on his own?

13:15.142 --> 13:17.144
[cannon blast]

13:18.667 --> 13:20.669
Beckett and Charity
were going to war.

13:20.712 --> 13:22.497
What if they were trying
to find a way to make sure

13:22.540 --> 13:24.978
their love survived,
even in death?

13:25.021 --> 13:26.675
In that memory vision
that we saw,

13:26.718 --> 13:28.329
Charity told Temperance,

13:28.372 --> 13:31.332
"You cannot imagine
the power of our bond."

13:31.375 --> 13:33.551
Beckett and Charity could have
formed a lover's pact.

13:33.595 --> 13:35.292
So, i-if Charity's soul
was split,

13:35.336 --> 13:37.164
that she never moves on,

13:37.207 --> 13:39.644
and if Beckett
becomes the Copperhead,

13:39.688 --> 13:41.211
then he would act like a...

13:41.255 --> 13:42.691
A radio?

13:42.734 --> 13:44.562
Tuned into Charity's frequency.

13:44.606 --> 13:46.521
Knowing she was
always out there.

13:49.611 --> 13:51.439
Still doesn't explain
why the Copperhead

13:51.482 --> 13:54.659
is going after Charity's soul
now that Temperance is back.

13:55.791 --> 13:58.359
That feels like Cora's revenge.

I'm clearing my mind

Why do you keep
harping on this?

You do, don't you?

16:27.334 --> 16:29.466
Eve, why didn't you tell us?

16:29.510 --> 16:32.034

an insanity defense,

motive for murder

could go both ways. Right?

What if the girl he kissed
got angry 'cause Anthony

16:41.696 --> 16:43.741

the boat's leaving
in the recording

16:45.221 --> 16:47.049
doesn't mean it actually left.

back. I mean, this recording

19:10.279 --> 19:11.367
Thought we were
clearing our minds.

19:11.411 --> 19:13.282
Yeah, well, talking
keeps me warm.

19:13.326 --> 19:15.806
So, 156 years ago, Beckett Dow

19:15.850 --> 19:17.634
split Charity's soul
into four pieces

19:17.678 --> 19:19.332
and those four pieces

19:19.375 --> 19:22.161
jumped into the nearest four
people on the battlefield.

19:22.204 --> 19:23.466
From that, we can
extrapolate that

19:23.510 --> 19:25.512
when those four people died,

19:25.555 --> 19:27.470
Charity's soul jumped
into the nearest person.

19:27.514 --> 19:28.819
And so on.Which is why you think

19:28.863 --> 19:30.734
that profiling
won't work, right--

19:30.778 --> 19:32.823
because the-the
soul jumping's random?

19:32.867 --> 19:34.695
I'm nodding.

19:34.738 --> 19:36.653
Can you tell?[chuckles]

19:36.697 --> 19:38.873
Um, once-once Charity was dead

19:38.916 --> 19:41.876
and-and... and-and
her soul was split,

19:41.919 --> 19:43.747
Beckett returned
to Horseshoe Bay

19:43.791 --> 19:46.750
and, uh, and-and
followed the instructions

19:46.794 --> 19:48.317
to make himself
the Copperhead,

19:48.361 --> 19:50.189
to complete their lover's pact.

19:50.232 --> 19:52.234
Temperance said that she thinks

19:52.278 --> 19:53.844
that the Copperhead's
gonna destroy Charity's soul

19:53.888 --> 19:55.542
and himself in one fell swoop.

19:55.585 --> 19:57.239
And if we're right
about the lover's pact,

19:57.283 --> 19:59.502
that makes this
a tragic love story.

19:59.546 --> 20:01.678
Beckett hopes to be reunited
with Charity.

20:01.722 --> 20:04.203
I-It's never been about revenge.

20:04.246 --> 20:05.508
It's always been about love.

20:05.552 --> 20:07.684
They just want
to be together, forever.

20:07.728 --> 20:09.730
So you have been in love.

20:12.559 --> 20:14.561
[static]

20:16.867 --> 20:18.869
[groans softly]

20:20.915 --> 20:22.917
[distorted voices]

20:24.266 --> 20:26.225
WOMAN'S VOICE [distorted]:
Ace.

20:27.530 --> 20:29.445
Ace?

20:29.489 --> 20:31.317
Charity?

20:31.360 --> 20:33.362
[static continuing]

20:38.976 --> 20:40.804
Charity.

20:40.848 --> 20:44.243
Charity.

20:44.286 --> 20:45.244
Charity.

20:46.723 --> 20:48.551
Not Charity.

20:48.595 --> 20:50.336
Die!

20:50.379 --> 20:53.426
The limestone's
crumbling there.

21:08.963 --> 21:10.399
Oh, my God.

21:10.443 --> 21:13.315
Charity Hudson Dow.
This belonged to Charity.

21:13.359 --> 21:15.491
We have a totem.Let's hope Ace
got that hatch open.

21:23.325 --> 21:25.414
Hope you don't mind that
I borrowed your keys, Eve.

21:34.641 --> 21:35.946
[scoffs softly]

21:38.340 --> 21:39.907
Do you want to explain to us
why you hid

21:39.950 --> 21:43.737
your dead boyfriend's
$27,000 watch in your suitcase?

21:43.780 --> 21:46.000
You broke into my car?

21:46.043 --> 21:47.784
What happened to
"follow your gut"?

21:47.828 --> 21:49.699
Or did you only
want us to do that

21:49.743 --> 21:52.267
when we were proving
your possession excuse?

21:52.311 --> 21:54.269
That is a violation, Bess.

21:54.313 --> 21:55.618
She's been cooperating.

21:55.662 --> 21:57.272
Oh, excuse me
for wanting answers.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.796
I mean, come on--
why was that in there?

21:59.840 --> 22:01.755
Okay, Eve, why was it hidden?

22:01.798 --> 22:03.670
Come on.You gonna say
it was a gift

22:03.713 --> 22:06.586
or that you have no idea
how it got in there?

22:06.629 --> 22:09.806
Is it possessed?Anthony probably
put it in the dopp kit himself.

22:09.850 --> 22:11.765
He was obsessed
with that thing,

22:11.808 --> 22:13.506
and if he forgot to take
it off while we were

22:13.549 --> 22:15.377
on board, he probably just

22:15.421 --> 22:17.640
tucked it in there
for safekeeping. I don't know!

22:17.684 --> 22:20.991
God, she is using us,
and at the very least

22:21.035 --> 22:23.603
she's trying to worm her way
back into Nick's life

22:23.646 --> 22:26.432
and ruin your
relationship.That's not true. Ned!

22:26.475 --> 22:28.651
And at the very most,
she's using us

22:28.695 --> 22:30.392
to get away with murder.
Come on!

22:30.436 --> 22:32.046
Okay, but to kill
someone over a watch?

22:32.089 --> 22:34.048
Clearly, they were having
troubles in their relationship.

22:34.091 --> 22:37.399
Uh, angry girlfriend
plus a big payday?

22:37.443 --> 22:39.488
I mean, people have killed
for a lot less.[entry bell jingles]

22:40.533 --> 22:42.056
[scoffs]
See?

22:42.099 --> 22:45.625
Guilty.
Already on the run.

22:45.668 --> 22:48.454
Without her... without her keys
and her phone and her jacket?

22:48.497 --> 22:49.933
In the middle of
an Arctic front?

22:49.977 --> 22:52.371
It's, like... it's, like,
12 degrees outside.

22:53.720 --> 22:55.417
She blacked out.She blacked out.

22:55.461 --> 22:56.853
Oh, for God...

23:03.033 --> 23:05.819
NANCY:
The escape ladder
should be down this way

23:05.862 --> 23:07.734
based on our walking pace

23:07.777 --> 23:09.910
and the amount of corridors
we've passed.

23:09.953 --> 23:11.651
Trying to plot a mental
map of the tunnels.

23:11.694 --> 23:14.349
Still resisting the
discomfort of not knowing.

23:14.393 --> 23:15.916
Yeah, well, it's just
how my mind works.

23:15.959 --> 23:18.353
It's an incredible mind.
You can do anything.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.094
That's why you feel like
you have to do everything.

23:20.137 --> 23:22.488
Find the totem, ask the
ghost, save the town,

23:22.531 --> 23:24.968
map the tunnels.Are you-are you
profiling me

23:25.012 --> 23:27.449
or you making of fun of me
or both?

23:27.493 --> 23:29.364
It's a compliment.

23:29.408 --> 23:30.844
But I know just because
you can't do everything

23:30.887 --> 23:33.673
doesn't mean that it's easy
or doesn't require

23:33.716 --> 23:36.719
constant intentionality
and effort.

23:38.155 --> 23:39.853
You're definitely profiling me.

23:39.896 --> 23:41.985
It's how my mind works.

23:42.029 --> 23:44.423
You don't have to do anything
to mitigate my discomfort.

23:44.466 --> 23:46.425
I am...

23:46.468 --> 23:49.515
good with walking
into the unknown.

23:50.820 --> 23:52.822
[thudding in distance]

23:55.521 --> 23:56.783
Ace?

23:59.438 --> 24:01.396
Oh, my God.ACE: Hey!

24:01.440 --> 24:03.485
Oh, good.

24:03.529 --> 24:05.139
I have a couple of things.
Uh,

24:05.182 --> 24:08.490
we're gonna have to replace
the hatch. Also,

24:08.534 --> 24:10.927
I was wrong. We're not
dealing with Charity.

24:10.971 --> 24:14.061
But whoever the ghost is,
she still wants us to die.

24:14.104 --> 24:16.542
The icy front, though,
has kind of made her strong,

24:16.585 --> 24:18.108
so I think we should
probably vacate the premises

24:18.152 --> 24:19.849
until the freeze passes.

24:19.893 --> 24:22.156
After you.

24:27.509 --> 24:29.076
Eve?Eve!
Eve!

24:29.119 --> 24:30.904
Eve?Eve!

24:30.947 --> 24:32.645
Eve?Eve!
Eve?

24:33.863 --> 24:35.430
BESS:
She's here,

24:35.474 --> 24:36.475
by the water!

24:41.088 --> 24:42.916
Eve, stop!

24:42.959 --> 24:45.048
GEORGE:Eve, be careful.
There's an undertow!

24:45.092 --> 24:46.441
Eve!

24:46.485 --> 24:47.703
No, Nick,

24:47.747 --> 24:49.488
be careful!

24:49.531 --> 24:51.490
Eve! Eve!

24:52.621 --> 24:54.449
No!GEORGE: No, Nick!

24:54.493 --> 24:55.929
Hey, hey, no, no.Bess, what do we do?

24:55.972 --> 24:58.714
I don't... We just stay
here. Just stay. It's okay.

25:00.934 --> 25:02.588
Where is he?

25:02.631 --> 25:04.633
[groans]
Nick, come on!

25:07.549 --> 25:09.464
[panting]

25:09.508 --> 25:10.683
Oh, thank God.Come on.

25:19.126 --> 25:21.998
So cold.

25:22.042 --> 25:25.219
Here. There, are you okay?Come on. Come on.

25:25.262 --> 25:26.829
Come on.

25:26.873 --> 25:28.048
Come on.Come on.

25:28.091 --> 25:30.572
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

25:31.791 --> 25:32.966
Oh! Oh!

25:33.009 --> 25:35.229
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.

25:37.971 --> 25:39.668
What just happened?

25:40.669 --> 25:42.715
[sharp exhale]

25:52.681 --> 25:55.162
[indistinct conversation]

25:55.205 --> 25:57.686
Here.Thank you.

26:01.690 --> 26:03.605
They're still talking.

26:03.649 --> 26:06.216
Do you actually think
that Park can help Eve?

26:06.260 --> 26:07.783
Yeah, she's in good hands.

26:09.176 --> 26:10.743
[typing]

26:10.786 --> 26:12.179
We already did a
social media dive.

26:12.222 --> 26:13.615
BESS:
Except we didn't find

26:13.659 --> 26:16.662
anything that was from
a story or a snap.

26:16.705 --> 26:18.664
Those posts go away
after 24 hours.

26:18.707 --> 26:20.622
But nothing's ever gone
from the Internet.

26:20.666 --> 26:23.538
BESS:He's looking for deleted
posts. Maybe those can

26:23.582 --> 26:25.192
give us some answers.Yeah, it seems like answers

26:25.235 --> 26:26.802
are hard to come by today.

26:26.846 --> 26:28.891
We were wrong about it
being Charity

26:28.935 --> 26:30.719
who was haunting
the Historical Society,

26:30.763 --> 26:33.722
which means
we lost our only lead

26:33.766 --> 26:35.681
on Copperhead's
next victim, so...

26:35.724 --> 26:38.945
Yeah, and you touched a dead
person's snot rag for nothing.

26:38.988 --> 26:42.557
I still think these things
could be useful,

26:42.601 --> 26:44.994
even if Charity's
not around to talk to.

26:45.038 --> 26:46.648
You really think so?

26:46.692 --> 26:49.651
Yeah, I do.

26:49.695 --> 26:53.002
Um... uh, Park said

26:53.046 --> 26:55.875
he thinks he has an explanation
for Eve's blackouts.

26:55.918 --> 26:58.312
He said it's a trauma response.

27:00.096 --> 27:02.664
Eve started having
lost moments of time

27:02.708 --> 27:04.710
a little over two years ago.

27:04.753 --> 27:06.755
So, the blackouts are real?

27:06.799 --> 27:09.715
So, Eve's blackouts
started after you...

27:09.758 --> 27:11.630
killed someone
in self-defense.Uh-huh.

27:11.673 --> 27:13.022
Usually the kind
of behavior exhibited

27:13.066 --> 27:16.156
is either, um,
self-soothing or, um,

27:16.199 --> 27:18.071
self-harming.Like walking into the bay.

27:18.114 --> 27:19.202
Yeah.

27:19.246 --> 27:20.682
He said, uh,

27:20.726 --> 27:22.902
the blackouts
are triggered by, uh,

27:22.945 --> 27:25.818
Eve's emotions being heightened.

27:25.861 --> 27:28.255
Like during an argument.

27:28.298 --> 27:29.343
Hey, this...

27:29.386 --> 27:31.606
this is not your fault,
all right?

27:31.650 --> 27:33.913
No, no.
Th-This is mine.

27:33.956 --> 27:35.741
[computer chimes]

27:38.091 --> 27:41.747
Got something.

27:41.790 --> 27:43.749
This is a deleted story,

27:43.792 --> 27:46.273
geotagged in the same harbor
that Eve and Anthony were in,

27:46.316 --> 27:48.623
right around the time of death.

27:48.667 --> 27:49.885
GEORGE:
There's Eve.

27:49.929 --> 27:52.279
She's winding
and unwinding a line.

27:52.322 --> 27:55.717
That's repetitive movement--
self-soothing behavior.

27:57.327 --> 27:59.895
ACE:
And there's Anthony.
He looks a little...

27:59.939 --> 28:01.941
[gasps]

28:01.984 --> 28:03.682
It was an accident.

28:03.725 --> 28:07.120
You didn't have
anything to do with it.

28:07.163 --> 28:10.123
And I am so, so sorry

28:10.166 --> 28:12.299
for-for getting carried away.

28:12.342 --> 28:14.910
I have trust issues,

28:14.954 --> 28:16.782
and think I was projecting

28:16.825 --> 28:18.784
my distrust of someone
else onto you.

28:18.827 --> 28:20.176
Maybe you are right.

28:20.220 --> 28:22.918
I mean, you weren't
right about me.

28:22.962 --> 28:25.007
But you were right
to keep digging.

28:25.051 --> 28:26.661
Maybe you should
do the same thing

28:26.705 --> 28:29.185
with this other person.

28:32.406 --> 28:35.801
Thank you.
For helping Eve.

28:35.844 --> 28:37.150
And for going on
that wild-goose chase

28:37.193 --> 28:39.761
at the Historical Society
earlier.

28:39.805 --> 28:40.936
[chuckles softly]

28:40.980 --> 28:43.199
So, what's the plan now?

28:43.243 --> 28:45.898
Well, I just thought
that I would take some advice

28:45.941 --> 28:47.726
that I recently received...

28:47.769 --> 28:48.944
and sit here

28:48.988 --> 28:51.251
and do nothing.

28:51.294 --> 28:52.948
Care to join?

28:57.823 --> 28:59.128
You can have
the bigger half.

28:59.172 --> 29:00.347
BESS:Oh, and

29:00.390 --> 29:04.177
I nicked this out of your bag.

29:04.220 --> 29:07.484
It's... bad habit?

29:08.747 --> 29:11.010
I really didn't know
this was in there.

29:11.053 --> 29:13.186
I'll give it back
to his dad.

29:13.229 --> 29:15.710
It's been in his family
for generations.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.886
Generations!
Oh, my God.

29:17.930 --> 29:20.236
Is she okay?Oh, yeah,

29:20.280 --> 29:21.803
yeah, she does this
all the time.

29:21.847 --> 29:23.849
What if it's not random?

29:23.892 --> 29:27.722
What if Charity's soul
is passed down generationally?

29:27.766 --> 29:29.724
Uh, if that's the case,

29:29.768 --> 29:32.466
then all we'd-we'd need
to prove the theory

29:32.509 --> 29:34.990
is to confirm that
Matthew Burke and Jake Cazine

29:35.034 --> 29:36.383
had ancestors at Gettysburg
the day Charity died.

29:36.426 --> 29:37.906
And if they do,

29:37.950 --> 29:39.865
we can extrapolate
who the next victims would be

29:39.908 --> 29:41.127
from there.
We could

29:41.170 --> 29:42.955
compile a list
of potential victims.

29:42.998 --> 29:46.393
I mean, it'll be a big list,
but it's a lead.

29:46.436 --> 29:48.134
A solid lead.

29:48.177 --> 29:51.137
