09:42.732 --> 09:46.067
Oh. Well, I hear Kit
is still considering candidates.

09:46.069 --> 09:48.995
-Mm.
-I would know. I am one.

09:48.997 --> 09:50.237
I'm surprised
you can find the time,

09:50.239 --> 09:51.906
given all the books
you're signing.

09:51.908 --> 09:54.408
Yeah, well, no one can be
too busy to give Chastain the...

09:54.410 --> 09:56.502
the visionary leader
it so desperately needs.

09:56.504 --> 09:59.764
You know, someone
who's still got that... fire.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.474
Couldn't agree more.

10:11.260 --> 10:13.778
(chuckles)
Look who decided
to show his face.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.188
(Hundley laughs)

10:15.190 --> 10:17.264
HUNDLEY:
As if anyone could get enough

10:17.266 --> 10:19.008
-of that face.
-Eh...

10:19.010 --> 10:22.178
How long has it been this time?

10:22.180 --> 10:24.180
Uh, since that asthma patient,
I think.

10:24.182 --> 10:26.015
Aw. That was a month ago.

10:26.017 --> 10:27.867
We miss you.

10:27.869 --> 10:28.943
I miss you guys, too.

10:28.945 --> 10:30.536
Oh, enough to come back?

10:30.538 --> 10:33.131
You never know, I might sneak
back and torture you guys again.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.859
Conrad knows as long as I'm CEO,
he always has a place here.

10:35.861 --> 10:37.193
Thank you.

10:37.195 --> 10:39.804
I'm just dropping off a patient,
last name Tellenbaum.

10:39.806 --> 10:40.972
He's in the waiting room.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.974
Jackson Tellenbaum.
Hand injury, huh?

10:42.976 --> 10:44.959
And diagnosed
with metastatic lung cancer

10:44.961 --> 10:46.144
at Atlanta General.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.462
He's been avoiding doctors since

10:48.464 --> 10:50.890
because he has
no insurance, so...

10:50.892 --> 10:51.983
HUNDLEY:
We'll take care of him.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.134
CONRAD:
Who's the new attending?

10:53.136 --> 10:55.136
He looks familiar,
like this intern

10:55.138 --> 10:56.804
-I tried to train.
-Same bit, huh?

10:56.806 --> 10:58.156
I recognize the shoes.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.659
Yeah, well, you know,
unlike you, the rest of us,

11:00.661 --> 11:03.995
you know, we don't have all day,
so bring it in, baby.

11:05.314 --> 11:07.148
-Did you get the office
with the shower?
-I did.

11:07.150 --> 11:09.167
(chuckles)
It's a necessity
with these hours.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.651
But I will admit,

11:10.671 --> 11:13.246
it is way more fun giving
the orders than getting them,

11:13.248 --> 11:15.899
-especially from you.
-I bet.

11:15.901 --> 11:17.300
I bet.

11:21.740 --> 11:23.423
Good to see everyone.

11:23.425 --> 11:26.834

<i> Leel, I came here to see you</i>

13:14.127 --> 13:16.702

to get serious with a doctor.

13:20.191 --> 13:22.133
Not in this lifetime.

13:22.135 --> 13:25.044
Dr. Devi, DVT waiting on you
in Bay 9.

13:25.046 --> 13:27.639
I'll be with them next.
Hey, I got to go. Bye.

13:37.058 --> 13:39.633
Dr. Voss asked me to tag in.

13:39.635 --> 13:41.227
Oh, did she?

13:41.229 --> 13:43.563
Yeah, I've reviewed
our MMA champ's records,

13:43.565 --> 13:46.399
and Ms. Rodriguez has
a family history of cancer.

13:46.401 --> 13:49.143
And that abdominal mass
may indicate a lymphoma

13:49.145 --> 13:50.477
or hepatobiliary tumor.

13:50.479 --> 13:53.406
So we'll need our best hands
on hand.

13:53.408 --> 13:56.225
So you joining has nothing to do
with the tweet-storm of love

13:56.227 --> 13:59.486
coming for any of us
who save this superstar?

13:59.488 --> 14:01.506
No, you know, unlike some,
I'm not the kind of surgeon

14:01.508 --> 14:04.067
that needs validation
outside the hospital.

14:04.069 --> 14:07.070
Oh, says the man who had
his own surgical tool,

14:07.072 --> 14:08.421
supplement line and TV show.

14:08.423 --> 14:11.224
-Am I missing anything?
-Gentlemen.

14:15.021 --> 14:18.931
All right, she has
an abdominal aortic aneurysm.

14:18.933 --> 14:20.692
Six centimeters.

14:20.694 --> 14:22.694
And it's likely to rupture,
given her hypertension.

14:22.696 --> 14:25.196
BELL:
That's odd,
considering we see triple A's

14:25.198 --> 14:27.198
in mostly older men and smokers.

14:27.200 --> 14:30.259
That's why.
She has bamboo spine.

14:30.261 --> 14:32.519
Ankylosing spondylitis
can often be associated

14:32.521 --> 14:34.430
with triple A.

14:34.432 --> 14:36.190
T3 through L4 is
almost entirely fused together,

14:36.192 --> 14:37.950
with a column 3
unstable fracture at L1.

14:37.952 --> 14:41.287
-It's a miracle
she got out of bed.
-AUSTIN: Her pain tolerance

14:41.289 --> 14:43.030
-must be off the charts.
-We do a staged repair.

14:43.032 --> 14:45.108
Once you complete the triple A,

14:45.110 --> 14:47.427
I'll perform a posterior
stabilization and fusion.

14:48.279 --> 14:50.129
I'll join you, Dr. Austin.

14:50.131 --> 14:51.948
Both of us for a triple A?

14:51.950 --> 14:53.207
Is that necessary?

14:53.209 --> 14:55.393
Better safe than sorry.

14:56.897 --> 14:58.730
AUSTIN:
Fine.

14:58.732 --> 15:01.290
Let's all go break the news.

15:02.293 --> 15:04.293
Pain I can handle,
but ten months of me in bed

15:04.295 --> 15:05.737

the video

15:05.739 --> 15:07.071

Your aneurysm is
on the cusp of rupturing.

15:10.151 --> 15:11.651
BILLIE:
And your spine is too brittle.

15:11.653 --> 15:14.228
One punch at the wrong angle,
it could snap your back in half.

15:14.230 --> 15:16.563
So to fix my spine,
you want to break it yourself

15:16.565 --> 15:18.249

like some LEGO set?

15:18.251 --> 15:20.476

15:23.423 --> 15:25.164
you'll be asking yourself
the next time you hit the floor

15:25.166 --> 15:26.332
is why you didn't listen to us.

19:29.911 --> 19:31.752
Okay.

19:40.087 --> 19:41.596
Are you all right?

19:43.165 --> 19:44.998
Okay, toss me the bag.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.726
Them first.

19:49.505 --> 19:50.730
Fine. Go.

19:53.418 --> 19:55.359
-You back up!
-Whoa. All right.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.446
Give me the bag.

20:04.537 --> 20:05.928
What the...

20:05.930 --> 20:08.706
No. What the hell is<i> this?!</i>

20:08.708 --> 20:11.450
-No, you stop.
-Hold on.

20:11.452 --> 20:14.027
Hand me the blade
and we can talk.

20:14.029 --> 20:15.463
We just want to try to help.

20:18.534 --> 20:20.960
Jackson, easy, easy.
The drug is coming.

20:20.962 --> 20:23.112
Let's just talk.
Let's find a way out of this

20:23.114 --> 20:24.597
before the police get here.
Okay?

20:26.801 --> 20:29.785
You said you got a kid, right?

20:29.787 --> 20:31.687
Boy or girl?

20:34.901 --> 20:36.717
I've got a son.

20:36.719 --> 20:38.402
He's almost eight.

20:39.430 --> 20:42.055
He lives in Iowa
with his mom now.

20:42.057 --> 20:44.891
I've just been trying
to sock away money

20:44.893 --> 20:47.245
since the split, just...

20:47.247 --> 20:49.330
give him the things
that I never had.

20:50.899 --> 20:53.809
But I can't make things right

20:53.811 --> 20:56.254
unless I get more time.

20:56.256 --> 20:59.257
Jackson, getting cancer was
out of your control.

21:01.076 --> 21:02.909
But what you do now,

21:02.911 --> 21:04.820
that is up to you.

21:04.822 --> 21:08.824
CONRAD:
I said I'd make sure
you left here whole.

21:08.826 --> 21:10.309
Help me keep that promise.

21:11.662 --> 21:14.163
OFFICER:
Mr. Tellenbaum,
this is Atlanta PD.

21:14.165 --> 21:15.731
Is everything okay in there?

21:19.020 --> 21:20.695
Thank you for trying to help me.

21:22.840 --> 21:24.657
I didn't have much time anyway.

21:25.934 --> 21:27.451
No.

21:29.864 --> 21:31.864
Hey, can we get
some help in here?

21:31.866 --> 21:33.349
HUNDLEY:
Over here in Trauma Bay One.

21:33.351 --> 21:34.850
He took out part
of his internal jugular,

21:34.852 --> 21:36.109
but he missed the carotid.

21:36.111 --> 21:38.354
LEELA:
I'll get access.
Get me an 18-gauge.

21:38.356 --> 21:41.373
All right, and type and cross
four units right away.

21:41.375 --> 21:45.711
Jackson? Jackson?
Jackson, you with us?

21:45.713 --> 21:47.196
He's in hemorrhagic shock.

21:47.198 --> 21:48.955
Can't tamponade the bleeding
without impeding

21:48.957 --> 21:51.183
the venous return;
he needs an OR.

21:53.796 --> 21:55.704
(monitor beeping)

21:55.706 --> 21:58.149
-Heart rate 130.
-We don't have time
to stabilize him.

21:58.151 --> 21:59.299
Xavier, page Vascular
and Anesthesia.

21:59.301 --> 22:00.893
-He's coming to the OR now.
-Let's go.

22:00.895 --> 22:02.153
-IRVING: I got it.
-DEVON: Take it.

22:02.155 --> 22:04.530
Let's go. Transport!

22:06.159 --> 22:07.383
IRVING:
I'll maintain pressure.
Get the elevator.

22:07.385 --> 22:09.568
HUNDLEY:
This way, Officers.

22:09.570 --> 22:13.647
-I got fresh clothes
in my office.
-Thank you.

22:13.649 --> 22:15.574
All right, we got, what,

22:15.576 --> 22:18.077
four hours before he's out
of surgery and under arrest?

22:18.079 --> 22:19.837
Let's come up with
a treatment plan,

22:19.839 --> 22:22.247
try and buy this guy some
more time to see his family.

22:22.249 --> 22:24.342
-And I'll get his medical record
from Atlanta General.
-Good.

22:29.407 --> 22:31.757
On your way to
an emergency surgery, I hear.

22:31.759 --> 22:33.017
Indeed I am.

22:33.019 --> 22:34.501
Neck versus box cutter.

22:34.503 --> 22:36.169
Yeah, vascular repair
like that's gonna take

22:36.171 --> 22:38.080
maybe three, four hours.

22:38.082 --> 22:39.248
Well, don't you worry about it,
Randolph,

22:39.250 --> 22:40.583
I will make our triple A.

22:40.585 --> 22:42.342
Oh, there's no need to rush.
I can take good care

22:42.344 --> 22:45.529
-of our prizefighter myself.
-I'm sure you can.

22:50.595 --> 22:52.261
Are you okay?

22:52.263 --> 22:54.613
I'm pretty sure there's still
blood in places I can't see,

22:54.615 --> 22:55.781
but yeah.

22:55.783 --> 22:57.875
Well, I'm glad you're okay.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.502
I am now.

23:01.381 --> 23:03.714
(chuckling):
Oh! You guys should probably
close the door

23:03.716 --> 23:06.108
-if you're gonna, you know...
-What are you doing here?

23:06.110 --> 23:09.053
I brought lunch. Also...

23:09.055 --> 23:11.614
I got scolded by a Dr. Nolan
on the way in here.

23:11.616 --> 23:15.184
And can I just say, I don't like
the way he talks to you.

23:16.378 --> 23:18.729
I don't see how anyone
can mix you two up.

23:18.731 --> 23:20.898
I mean, you're spontaneous

23:20.900 --> 23:22.691
-and-and carefree, and you're...
-PADMA: Oh.

23:23.978 --> 23:25.694
...the love of my life.

23:27.131 --> 23:29.148
What did Dr. Nolan say
to you, exactly?

23:29.150 --> 23:32.151
Something about neph.
Nephews?

23:32.153 --> 23:35.896
Necrophilia, maybe.
I don't know. Sorry.

23:35.898 --> 23:37.230
But I remember his tone,

23:37.232 --> 23:39.858
and he reminded me
of Uncle Ojasvat. He was mean.

23:40.995 --> 23:43.403
This is why I don't like when
you just show up randomly.

23:43.405 --> 23:47.073
Because somehow it always
makes more work for me.

23:47.075 --> 23:49.093
-Leela...
-Thank you for lunch.

23:49.095 --> 23:52.430
It's been a day.
She'll be all right.

23:55.676 --> 23:57.601
Hey. You can keep it.

23:57.603 --> 23:59.085
Thanks.

23:59.087 --> 24:00.329
Jackson's medical records.

24:00.331 --> 24:02.606
-Oh, nice.
-If he's EGFR positive,

24:02.608 --> 24:03.941
we can consider afatinib.

24:03.943 --> 24:05.276
Unless he has
an additional mutation.

24:05.278 --> 24:06.852
Yeah, T790M.
Then we add...

24:06.854 --> 24:09.672
BOTH:
Osimertinib.

24:09.674 --> 24:12.341
I forgot how much fun you two
are when you get together.

24:12.343 --> 24:14.343
I'll start by reconfirming
the pathology report

24:14.345 --> 24:16.178
and the genetics of the cancer

24:16.180 --> 24:18.013
and see whether he's a candidate
for targeted therapy.

24:18.015 --> 24:19.957
Sounds like a plan.
Keep me posted.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.542
Oh, wait. Hold on a second.

24:22.703 --> 24:25.204
Look at this lung biopsy report.

24:25.206 --> 24:29.041
Necrosis compatible with
necrotic tumor tissue.

24:29.043 --> 24:32.194
Compatible with,
not diagnostic of.

24:32.196 --> 24:34.530
So, because he had
a lesion in his spine,

24:34.532 --> 24:36.307
enlarged lymph nodes
and a lung nodule...

24:36.309 --> 24:38.434
They concluded it was cancer.

24:39.870 --> 24:41.887
Have you seen his fingernails?

24:41.889 --> 24:43.372
Yeah.

24:43.374 --> 24:45.224
When was the last time
you saw a stage IV

24:45.226 --> 24:47.151
metastatic lung cancer patient
without clubbing?

24:47.153 --> 24:48.635
It happens, but rarely.

24:48.637 --> 24:51.805
I think it's possible that
Jackson doesn't have cancer.

24:51.807 --> 24:53.398
It's possible.
It's also a leap.

24:53.400 --> 24:56.735
I'm just saying
it's worth digging deeper.

24:56.737 --> 24:58.704
Maybe he was misdiagnosed.

25:03.151 --> 25:05.060
-I got the page.
-Her aneurysm ruptured.

25:05.062 --> 25:06.820
She's struggling
to move her legs.

25:06.822 --> 25:08.063
Cauda equina syndrome.

25:08.065 --> 25:09.398
-Is your schedule clear?
-I'll clear it.

25:09.400 --> 25:11.258
-Let's do this.
-(pained groan)

25:15.072 --> 25:18.073
DEVON:
So if it's not cancer, Jackson's
issue could be autoimmune.

25:18.075 --> 25:19.925
Inflammatory. Vasculitis.

25:19.927 --> 25:21.852
-We're missing an infection.
-Histoplasmosis.

25:21.854 --> 25:23.503
Could explain his lung nodules,

25:23.505 --> 25:25.523
but he has no history of travel
the past few years.

25:25.525 --> 25:28.859
Okay, then that would also
eliminate blastomycosis,

25:28.861 --> 25:30.269
coccidiomycosis.

25:30.271 --> 25:31.695
Yep, but doesn't rule out
abscesses.

25:31.697 --> 25:33.489
Right.

25:36.093 --> 25:38.702
Okay, so, we have
three possibilities,

25:38.704 --> 25:40.186
all treatable.

25:40.188 --> 25:42.206
Yep. We add tests
to his pre-op labs,

25:42.208 --> 25:44.116
get the rest drawn in the OR.

25:44.118 --> 25:46.877
How much time do you have before
your dinner date with Queen Gi?

25:46.879 --> 25:50.030
Uh, hour and a half.
Two, tops.

25:50.032 --> 25:52.958
All right, I'll rush
these tests.

25:52.960 --> 25:54.793
(sighs)

25:54.795 --> 25:56.870
(monitor beeping)

25:56.872 --> 25:59.014
Dr. Bell.

26:00.634 --> 26:02.042
Finished already?

26:02.044 --> 26:04.953
Fast and flawless, as always.

26:04.955 --> 26:07.690
Shall we? Bovie to me.

26:09.126 --> 26:10.526
BELL:
I have the better angle.

26:19.561 --> 26:23.080
AUSTIN:
Chu, angle the head down
15 degrees.

26:23.082 --> 26:24.748
I prefer we keep it at ten.

26:26.994 --> 26:29.628
Uh, 13 it is.

26:31.165 --> 26:34.258
Resecting the aneurysm.

26:38.264 --> 26:41.247
Dr. Chu, would you wake me up
when Dr. Austin is finished

26:41.249 --> 26:43.559
so I can insert the graft?

26:55.764 --> 26:57.364
You boys done?

27:01.178 --> 27:02.527
BELL:
Just finished.

27:02.529 --> 27:04.196
Randolph.

27:04.198 --> 27:05.864
AJ.

27:05.866 --> 27:07.625
She's all yours, Dr. Sutton.

27:08.869 --> 27:11.128
I have a break in my schedule.

27:11.130 --> 27:13.205
You mind if I stick around
and watch you do your thing?

27:13.207 --> 27:16.191
Plenty of seats. Buckle up.

27:16.193 --> 27:18.877
All right, pedicle screws
and rods on my left.

27:18.879 --> 27:21.196
Osteotomes, burr, rongeurs
on my right.

27:21.198 --> 27:22.723
Let's get the Wilson frame
and flip her.

27:27.480 --> 27:29.705
Hey.

27:29.707 --> 27:32.358
What's so important you needed
to see me right now?

27:33.819 --> 27:36.061
Tell me what you think. Ha!

27:36.063 --> 27:38.155
The guy who just sold it to me

27:38.157 --> 27:40.065
drove it around the Badlands
for three months.

27:40.067 --> 27:44.203
It already has a bed,
fridge, stove and...

27:46.056 --> 27:47.498
...two solar panels.
Check it out.

27:47.500 --> 27:48.815
You're gonna live in that?

27:48.834 --> 27:51.059
Yeah. Lots of people are
living the van life now.

27:51.061 --> 27:54.062
It gives you total freedom.
And this thing is so cozy.

27:54.064 --> 27:55.564
Padma...

27:55.566 --> 27:57.841
I'm thinking Charleston, maybe,
and then the Keys.

27:57.843 --> 27:59.325
I know you don't get
that much time...

27:59.327 --> 28:01.387
How long can you keep
doing this?

28:03.516 --> 28:04.756
Doing what?

28:04.758 --> 28:06.517
Exactly.

28:06.519 --> 28:08.168
What are you doing?

28:08.170 --> 28:11.430
-I...
-Look, I know this seems like
it's fun and everything,

28:11.432 --> 28:15.008
but don't you think it's time
you put down some roots?

28:15.010 --> 28:17.194
Or maybe<i> a</i> root?

28:19.256 --> 28:20.864
You know what, forget it.

28:20.866 --> 28:22.574
I'll check it out later.

28:25.020 --> 28:28.096
I threw your milk out last week.

28:28.098 --> 28:30.449
It was five months old.

28:30.451 --> 28:32.434
And I would have noticed sooner
if I wasn't lacto.

28:32.436 --> 28:33.544
What's your point?

28:33.713 --> 28:36.046
When was the last time
you even had a meal at home?

28:36.048 --> 28:37.940
-We order in.
-To the apartment
you're never at?

28:37.942 --> 28:39.124
With the boyfriend
you never see?

28:39.126 --> 28:41.944
-I see Devon all the time.
-At work.

28:41.946 --> 28:43.779
Where you always are.

28:43.781 --> 28:46.039
When I first came to Atlanta,
I was only gonna crash

28:46.041 --> 28:47.725
with you a few weeks.

28:47.727 --> 28:50.135
I stayed because I love you.

28:50.137 --> 28:53.230
And, Leel, you don't eat.
You barely sleep.

28:53.232 --> 28:56.792
-All you talk about is medicine!
-That's the job.

28:56.794 --> 28:59.069
I'm a<i> doctor.</i>

28:59.071 --> 29:00.796
I'm literally saving lives.

29:00.798 --> 29:02.030
And what about your life?

29:04.726 --> 29:07.227
Look, Leel,

29:07.229 --> 29:10.247
I am so proud of you.

29:10.249 --> 29:14.042
You do things every day
that I can't even pronounce.

29:15.646 --> 29:18.905
But I remember a girl who did
a lot of other things, too.

29:18.907 --> 29:21.741
She dreamed up crazy cartoons

29:21.743 --> 29:23.910
and went shopping for

29:23.912 --> 29:26.488
the ugliest antiques
we could find.

29:26.490 --> 29:29.249
Do you have any idea
how hard it is for me

29:29.251 --> 29:31.251
to do what I do in there
every single day?

29:31.253 --> 29:34.271
But I'm doing it, Padma.

29:34.273 --> 29:38.016
When was the last time you took
even five minutes for yourself?

29:38.018 --> 29:39.610
(pager beeps)

29:44.617 --> 29:45.574
You gotta go.

29:53.700 --> 29:55.000
Hey.

29:56.870 --> 29:59.871
Aw... I remember that look.

29:59.873 --> 30:02.282
Lab results were negative.

30:02.284 --> 30:04.359
For all three and the cultures?

30:04.361 --> 30:06.136
I'll take that to him, thanks.

30:06.138 --> 30:07.971
All right,
so we broaden our search.

30:07.973 --> 30:09.548
Check a glucan
and galactomannan.

30:09.550 --> 30:12.200
Look for brucellosis,
actinomycosis.

30:12.202 --> 30:13.718
I will keep searching.

30:13.720 --> 30:16.730
You have a dinner date
with a very special lady.

30:19.968 --> 30:21.409
Let me know.

30:21.411 --> 30:23.695
I will. Come on,
I'll walk you out.

30:25.491 --> 30:27.199
Hang on a sec.

30:34.649 --> 30:37.000
CONRAD:
Does he look hyper-pigmented
to you?

30:45.660 --> 30:47.344
I remember that look.

30:49.014 --> 30:50.755
Last pedicle screw.

30:50.757 --> 30:51.907
Now we finish the fusion

30:51.909 --> 30:53.559
and realign vertebrae.

31:01.251 --> 31:04.510
I heard you and Bell
are competing.

31:04.512 --> 31:07.255
Well, I wouldn't call it
much of a competition.

31:07.257 --> 31:10.092
My two cents?
The best chiefs command

31:10.094 --> 31:11.702
the most respect of their peers.

31:11.704 --> 31:13.686
That's you.

31:13.688 --> 31:15.280
Thanks for the two cents.

31:15.282 --> 31:16.856
Besides, I've heard
a few stories.

31:16.858 --> 31:18.024
Probably more skeletons

31:18.026 --> 31:20.769
in his closet than yours,
if you ask me.

31:20.771 --> 31:22.028
(monitor alarm sounding)

31:22.030 --> 31:23.605
CHU:
We're losing motor signals.

31:23.607 --> 31:25.698
BILLIE:
Her spinal cord
is getting impinged.

31:25.700 --> 31:27.050
Pituitary rongeurs.

31:27.052 --> 31:29.720
-Everything okay?
-Just trying to find the source.

31:31.056 --> 31:33.115
Could be a bone fragment.

31:33.117 --> 31:35.150
-(alarm sounding)
-Oh, this isn't working.

31:35.152 --> 31:36.468
She'll be permanently
paralyzed soon

31:36.470 --> 31:38.044
if we don't relieve
the pressure on her cord.

31:38.046 --> 31:39.621
What's the move?

31:39.623 --> 31:41.231
A Hail Mary.

31:41.233 --> 31:43.984
But I'll need an extra
set of hands. Page Dr. Voss.

31:48.908 --> 31:50.982
They told me motor signals
went out.

31:50.984 --> 31:52.150
BILLIE:
Sensory signals, too.

31:52.152 --> 31:53.911
I need to bring her out
of anesthesia.

31:53.913 --> 31:55.654
The wake-up test?

31:55.656 --> 31:56.805
She could move

31:56.823 --> 31:58.731
and disrupt the instruments
in her back,

31:58.733 --> 32:00.066
causing even more damage.

32:00.068 --> 32:01.326
It's our only shot
at finding out

32:01.328 --> 32:03.145
if her loss of signal is related
to a dislodged probe

32:03.147 --> 32:04.663
or another issue.

32:04.665 --> 32:07.573
We're running out of time.

32:07.575 --> 32:09.092
(alarms sounding)

32:09.094 --> 32:10.761
KIT:
Lighten anesthesia.

32:10.763 --> 32:11.762
CHU:
Pulling back on the propofol.

32:20.998 --> 32:22.606
Tamiko?

32:24.168 --> 32:25.925
This is Dr. Sutton.

32:25.927 --> 32:27.427
You're in surgery.

32:27.429 --> 32:29.429
Don't worry,
everything will be okay.

32:29.431 --> 32:32.741
We just need your help.
Blink if you understand.

32:34.678 --> 32:35.535
Good.

32:37.014 --> 32:40.165
Now blink if you can feel
a touch on your right leg.

32:42.795 --> 32:44.444
Hang tight, okay?

32:45.539 --> 32:47.780
We can't keep her awake
for long, but I think

32:47.782 --> 32:49.541
we should perform a distraction.

32:49.543 --> 32:51.860
And improve the correction
of the spine.

32:51.862 --> 32:53.595
Worth a shot.

32:57.792 --> 33:00.560
-Distractor's in place.
-I'll loosen the locking bolt.

33:06.134 --> 33:07.442
BILLIE:
Let's push.

33:11.898 --> 33:14.992
Let's try that again.

33:14.994 --> 33:17.494
Blink if you can feel
a touch on your leg.

33:21.149 --> 33:23.816
-(monitor beeping)
-Signal's coming back.

33:23.818 --> 33:25.669
Nerve pressure's relieved.

33:25.671 --> 33:27.229
You did great.

33:27.231 --> 33:29.715
Now we're gonna put you
back to sleep and finish up.

33:34.496 --> 33:37.088
That was quite the show,
Dr. Sutton.

33:37.090 --> 33:39.016
Show's not over yet.

33:39.018 --> 33:41.018
A full exam after surgery
will tell us more.

33:46.191 --> 33:49.276
<i> WOMAN (on TV):</i>
<i> Ask your doctor if Halcipr...</i>

33:50.845 --> 33:53.588
Guess I won't be running through
the fields anytime soon.

33:53.590 --> 33:55.532
These ads don't do our patients
any favors.

33:55.534 --> 33:57.850
There's a reason almost every
other country in the world

33:57.852 --> 33:59.427
bans them.

33:59.429 --> 34:01.279
But when the FDA eased
restrictions in the '90s,

34:01.281 --> 34:04.266
drug companies jumped at
the chance to market their drugs

34:04.268 --> 34:06.025
to as many people as they could.

34:06.027 --> 34:08.194
CONRAD:
So all too often, they present

34:08.196 --> 34:11.122
biased or incomplete
information.

34:11.124 --> 34:12.865
And mislead people
to ask their doctors

34:12.867 --> 34:14.051
for drugs they don't even need.

34:14.053 --> 34:16.127
And no drug is for everyone.

34:16.129 --> 34:18.280
And Halcipride, hmm,
that drug...

34:18.282 --> 34:21.516
that drug won't help you,
Jackson.

34:24.063 --> 34:26.229
Because you don't have cancer.

34:28.550 --> 34:30.975
DEVON:
Your labs confirmed
our suspicion.

34:30.977 --> 34:33.295
You were misdiagnosed.

34:33.297 --> 34:36.281
What you really have
is tuberculosis.

34:37.467 --> 34:38.967
H-How?

34:38.969 --> 34:40.911
TB can look a lot like cancer,

34:40.913 --> 34:43.196
and it can travel anywhere,
even your spine.

34:43.198 --> 34:44.973
And it can travel
to your adrenal gland.

34:44.975 --> 34:46.975
That's what caused your skin
to darken.

34:46.977 --> 34:48.901
DEVON:
Which is what tipped us off.

34:48.903 --> 34:50.754
The best news is
we can treat it.

34:51.998 --> 34:53.665
Thank you.

34:53.667 --> 34:57.076
So you're gonna need to be
on several medications, okay,

34:57.078 --> 34:58.670
for the next six months.

34:58.672 --> 35:01.080
How much is that gonna cost?

35:01.082 --> 35:03.082
We checked. It's affordable.

35:03.084 --> 35:04.917
(police radio droning
indistinctly)

35:04.919 --> 35:06.436
(indistinct chatter)

35:10.334 --> 35:12.925
Once you're discharged,
you'll be put under arrest,

35:12.927 --> 35:14.502
but until then,
you're still a patient,

35:14.504 --> 35:16.738
so let's focus on
you getting well, okay?

35:18.600 --> 35:20.200
Thank you.

35:23.530 --> 35:26.197
Look, I get why you left,
but I just feel like,

35:26.199 --> 35:29.275
you know, this is what
you were meant to be doing.

35:29.277 --> 35:32.479
Ah, I miss it, man. I do.

35:32.481 --> 35:37.175
It wasn't my plan to leave,
but GiGi is my everything.

35:38.453 --> 35:40.195
She's waiting for our dinner.
I can make it.

35:40.197 --> 35:41.680
She comes first now.

35:42.957 --> 35:45.433
I'm so sorry.
I mean, for all of it.

35:46.794 --> 35:49.795
Just know that you and Nic

35:49.797 --> 35:52.023
are missed every day.

36:02.995 --> 36:05.370
Good work today, Dr. Hawkins.

36:07.666 --> 36:09.624
You, too, Dr. Pravesh.

36:12.654 --> 36:14.462
You, too.

36:21.680 --> 36:23.597
Night, Devi.

36:30.747 --> 36:33.190
-Hey.
-Hey.

36:35.085 --> 36:36.735

37:27.988 --> 37:30.062
I know you're both eager
to find out

37:30.064 --> 37:31.915
who our next chief of surgery
will be,

37:31.917 --> 37:33.157
so I'll cut to the chase.

37:33.159 --> 37:35.234
It won't be either of you.

37:35.236 --> 37:36.828
-Are you serious?
-Excuse me?

37:36.830 --> 37:40.406
You've both made remarkable
contributions to Chastain.

37:40.408 --> 37:42.241
But for you, AJ,
chief would just be

37:42.243 --> 37:44.094
another feather in your cap.

37:44.096 --> 37:46.504
And, frankly,
you don't have the time.

37:46.506 --> 37:49.324
And, Randolph, you've already
done the job once.

37:49.326 --> 37:51.175
Yeah, which means
I have experience,

37:51.177 --> 37:53.177
which is hardly
a detriment to...

37:53.179 --> 37:55.013
And you quit because
you didn't like it.

37:55.015 --> 37:57.923
It was too time-consuming
and bureaucratic.

37:57.925 --> 38:00.443
-You want to cut.
-True that.

38:00.445 --> 38:03.095
You only wanted the job because
you didn't want me to have it.

38:03.097 --> 38:05.857
No, I-I wanted it because...

38:05.859 --> 38:08.285
I wanted it.

38:08.287 --> 38:10.269
Gentlemen, I respect that
you're both competitive

38:10.271 --> 38:13.123
and in it to win,
but I have made my decision.

38:13.125 --> 38:15.292
An unfortunate one, no doubt,

38:15.294 --> 38:18.686
but one I will respect
nonetheless.

38:18.688 --> 38:20.213
KIT:
Thank you, AJ.

38:21.633 --> 38:24.301
(Bell exhales heavily)

38:25.695 --> 38:28.120
(inhales deeply)

38:28.122 --> 38:30.473
Well, maybe it's for the best.

38:30.475 --> 38:31.716
How so?

38:31.718 --> 38:33.201
Because there's a woman

38:33.203 --> 38:36.980
that I've been seeing
for a while now, and, uh,

38:36.982 --> 38:39.891
we kind of have
a good thing going.

38:39.893 --> 38:42.560
-I-I think she'd agree.
-Would she?

38:42.562 --> 38:45.880
A little less time spent at work
might mean more time with her,

38:45.882 --> 38:48.474
if she can get away.

38:48.476 --> 38:51.828
I'm afraid that safety report
on her desk

38:51.830 --> 38:53.538
might keep her late tonight.

38:54.666 --> 38:56.458
She's worth waiting up for.

39:00.230 --> 39:04.174
If it's not me and it's not AJ,

39:04.176 --> 39:07.177
who's the next chief of surgery?

39:07.179 --> 39:09.087
Me?

39:09.089 --> 39:11.831
You're a tireless,
if sometimes bossy,

39:11.833 --> 39:13.241
advocate for patients.

39:13.243 --> 39:15.501
But I expect nothing less.

39:15.503 --> 39:19.097
You're also a leader,
and you work well with others.

39:19.099 --> 39:21.858
You will build consensus,
not bully.

39:21.860 --> 39:23.693
A style I like.

39:23.695 --> 39:25.603
I'm certainly flattered...

39:25.605 --> 39:28.198
Of course, the admin burdens
are not insignificant.

39:28.200 --> 39:31.517
You'll have to adjust
your surgical schedule,

39:31.519 --> 39:33.261
manage fragile egos
across the department--

39:33.263 --> 39:35.688
not always an easy task--

39:35.690 --> 39:39.584
but you would have a real hand
in shaping this place.

39:41.213 --> 39:42.954
Of course, if you need
more time to...

39:42.956 --> 39:44.756
I'm in.

39:46.793 --> 39:48.635

40:16.973 --> 40:18.748
Only one way to find out.

40:22.979 --> 40:26.297
-All right.
-Be careful. (laughs)

40:33.990 --> 40:36.307
(laughs) It's really cool.

40:40.847 --> 40:43.690
Look, about earlier...

40:44.926 --> 40:46.592
You're not wrong.

40:46.594 --> 40:49.279
I know. But do you really
want to take advice

40:49.281 --> 40:51.673
from a girl who lives in a van?

40:51.675 --> 40:55.176

-All that paper pushing.

-Managing inferior surgeons.

42:10.270 --> 42:12.195
