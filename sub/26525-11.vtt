WEBVTT

00:59.893 --> 01:00.894
Oh!

01:01.436 --> 01:03.605
-Dude, did you see that?
-Yeah, that cat's so dumb.

01:03.688 --> 01:06.232
No, the pills. They're glowing.

01:08.068 --> 01:11.654
Jerry. Can you please keep it down?
I have a chem test tomorrow.

01:16.284 --> 01:18.870
Jerry, bro. I thought
the point of your mobile

01:18.953 --> 01:20.914
door-to-door service was
that you came to my door?

01:21.164 --> 01:23.625
Here you go.
Guaranteed happiness in pill form,

01:23.708 --> 01:25.084
just like America promised.

01:25.710 --> 01:28.880
-Thank you.
-These look fun.

01:41.309 --> 01:44.604
Jerry, why does Spencer
look like Hagrid on steroids?

01:45.104 --> 01:48.942
No idea, but we should
get the hell out of here. Go!

01:53.113 --> 01:54.531
Attack Card.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.449
-No.
-No!

01:56.825 --> 02:02.789
-That's the fifth time.
-That means I win. Yes!

02:02.872 --> 02:04.040
I don't understand this game.

02:04.457 --> 02:06.960
These are not kittens,
nor do they explode.

02:07.043 --> 02:09.420
Well, I love that you guys do this.

02:09.546 --> 02:11.673
Game night was a staple in my family.

02:11.756 --> 02:12.841
Where did you grow up, Nia?

02:12.924 --> 02:14.467
A small town up north called Parthas.

02:14.551 --> 02:17.428
Doesn't that mean "paradise"
in Irish? It's a pretty high bar.

02:17.512 --> 02:19.305
Paradise is an understatement.

02:19.514 --> 02:22.684
The town's not just beautiful,
but aliens and humans have lived

02:22.767 --> 02:24.519
together in harmony for decades.

02:24.602 --> 02:26.729
I'm actually going back
this weekend for Harvest Fest.

02:26.813 --> 02:27.981
And...

02:28.064 --> 02:29.107
The Bowl Game!

02:29.232 --> 02:31.568
♪ <i>Danvers Sisters, yes, we can ♪</i>

02:31.651 --> 02:33.945
<i>♪ If you can't do it, Danvers can ♪</i>

02:34.028 --> 02:36.990
No! No! You two cannot be
on the same team again.

02:37.073 --> 02:39.284
I agree. Inside jokes,
short-hand from Midvale.

02:39.367 --> 02:40.660
This is an unfair advantage.

02:40.743 --> 02:42.245
-So?
-Hey, but, you know, maybe we have

02:42.328 --> 02:44.455
-an unfair advantage, too.

02:44.539 --> 02:46.416
You could be right.
Greatest human invention?

02:46.499 --> 02:47.500
-The electric light.
-Printing press.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.711
-Oh. Fail.
-Okay. My turn.

02:50.128 --> 02:52.213
Whoa! Easy! My favorite movie?

02:54.299 --> 02:55.717
<i>Center Stage?</i>

02:56.092 --> 02:57.427
Excuse me?

02:57.510 --> 03:00.096
What? You spent an entire summer
learning the red shoe dance.

03:00.930 --> 03:02.307
You broke three lamps.

03:02.849 --> 03:04.058
No. Okay...

03:04.225 --> 03:05.393
<i>Terminator 2?</i> Duh.

03:05.476 --> 03:08.521
No, that's your favorite.
Come on, Alex! Think!

03:11.107 --> 03:13.109
I'm totally blanking. Um...

03:16.070 --> 03:17.864
Duty calls. Never fails.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.574
Well, at least Haley's out of town.

03:19.657 --> 03:20.909
Sorry, guys.

03:21.117 --> 03:23.453
-Uh, hey.
-Hey.

03:23.536 --> 03:25.163
No, it's gonna be okay. There's nothing

03:25.246 --> 03:27.957
too end-of-the-worldly.
It's just an alien brawl at NCU.

03:28.374 --> 03:29.959
-See ya.
-Right. Okay.

04:02.992 --> 04:05.745
Thank you for your assistance,
Supergirl. We'll take it from here.

04:05.828 --> 04:07.038
Happy to help, Alex.

04:07.288 --> 04:08.289
Uh...

04:08.373 --> 04:09.958
One more thing.
I would really appreciate it

04:10.041 --> 04:11.793
if you would address me
as Director Danvers.

04:12.168 --> 04:13.169
Oh.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.713
Yes, of course, Director Danvers.

04:22.428 --> 04:24.097
You realize you have
two donuts in your hands,

04:24.180 --> 04:25.390
and that those don't even go together?

04:25.473 --> 04:26.641
-Do I?
-Yeah.

04:28.518 --> 04:29.602
Okay.

04:29.894 --> 04:32.772
I may be eating my feelings.

04:33.690 --> 04:34.691
Ah.

04:35.650 --> 04:37.318
It's Alex.

04:39.529 --> 04:41.781
I thought we were good
after the mind wipe,

04:41.864 --> 04:43.116
but I was wrong.

04:43.950 --> 04:45.743
The way she spoke to me last night,

04:45.827 --> 04:47.036
to Supergirl...

04:47.787 --> 04:49.038
She was so cold.
She doesn't know that you're Supergirl.

04:50.456 --> 04:52.792
I know. Just didn't realize
how much it would hurt.

04:53.626 --> 04:56.421
I mean, not knowing that my favorite
movie is <i>The Wizard of Oz?</i>

04:56.546 --> 05:00.383
Eliza thought that I would relate
to the adventures of a young girl

05:00.466 --> 05:04.095
being lost in a faraway land.
It was my favorite movie

05:04.220 --> 05:05.930
because I was from a different planet.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.849
And now, Alex doesn't know that.

05:08.683 --> 05:09.934
Not anymore.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.270
Yeah. It's gotta be tough.

05:12.478 --> 05:14.272
I'm sorry.
That must be really hard for you.

05:15.398 --> 05:17.859
What if the mind wipe has consequences

05:17.942 --> 05:19.652
that we didn't anticipate?

05:19.736 --> 05:21.404
You can't think that way.

05:21.487 --> 05:23.281
Look, maybe the best course
of action right now,

05:23.364 --> 05:26.701
is to throw yourself into your work
and just take your mind off of it.

05:27.243 --> 05:30.246
Mr. Olsen...
I'm sorry. Is this a bad time?

05:30.371 --> 05:33.875
No. No. I was... Donut?

05:34.125 --> 05:38.504
I don't eat sugar.
Or dough. Or breakfast.

05:39.380 --> 05:41.591
You've got chocolate on your...

05:41.799 --> 05:44.135
-Oh, oops, um...

05:44.302 --> 05:46.054
Better use the ladies' room.

05:46.137 --> 05:47.555
Excuse me.

05:48.056 --> 05:52.060
Mr. Olsen, I wanted to
pitch you a story, but it's...

05:52.810 --> 05:54.228
-Please.
-It's kind of sensitive.

05:54.312 --> 05:55.396
Yeah. No worries.

05:57.106 --> 05:59.067
It's about L-Corp and Ms. Luthor.

05:59.150 --> 06:00.735
My source in the accounting department

06:00.818 --> 06:02.320
found a glitch in their numbers,

06:02.528 --> 06:04.280
caught rumors of a "black budget."

06:04.864 --> 06:06.908
He thinks it has to do
with genetic testing.

06:06.991 --> 06:08.785
Genetic testing isn't illegal.

06:08.868 --> 06:11.704
If it wasn't shady, why would
they keep it off the books?

06:13.289 --> 06:15.041
So, can I follow the money?

06:15.124 --> 06:17.126
Yeah. But send me what you have first.

06:17.710 --> 06:19.170
I wanna vet it.

06:22.465 --> 06:24.884
I know I promised Mom
I'd be home this weekend.

06:25.593 --> 06:27.345
I planned to, but--

06:27.887 --> 06:30.139
Maeve, I'm not terminally irresponsible.

06:31.599 --> 06:34.685
My flight was canceled because
all of the flights were canceled.

06:35.686 --> 06:37.980
Well, I can't leave now,
because I have a job.

06:38.064 --> 06:39.232
Okay, I'll try.

06:40.316 --> 06:41.609
I love you, too. Bye.

06:43.778 --> 06:48.116
Sister. We're close,
but she drives me crazy.

06:48.199 --> 06:49.742
-I can relate to that.

06:51.202 --> 06:52.578
I've never missed Harvest Fest.

06:52.662 --> 06:54.622
You should take the day off.
James won't mind.

06:54.705 --> 06:55.873
It's a long drive and--

06:56.374 --> 06:58.668
Fall asleep at weird times? I know.

06:58.751 --> 06:59.794
-Yeah.

07:00.419 --> 07:01.420
So, I'll drive.

07:01.504 --> 07:03.172
What? You'd come with me?

07:03.256 --> 07:06.175
Yeah. Your town's
like an oasis of tolerance, right?

07:06.259 --> 07:08.678
So, I'll just pitch a story idea
about it to James.

07:09.011 --> 07:10.513
Kara, that would be amazing.

07:10.596 --> 07:12.223
First commandment of road trips...

07:12.348 --> 07:15.435
Thou shalt defer
to the driver's choice of music.

07:17.770 --> 07:20.982
Those are
not bruises, simply toxins.

07:21.065 --> 07:23.693
Pulled to the surface
by the Truth Seeker.

07:25.236 --> 07:27.029
Not to worry, they'll vanish soon.

07:27.697 --> 07:28.698
I hope so.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.741
Something just doesn't feel right.

07:30.825 --> 07:32.618
Perhaps this will make you feel better.

07:33.828 --> 07:37.039
I've discovered the species
we apprehended last night.

07:37.123 --> 07:38.207
They're human?

07:38.624 --> 07:40.042
No, not just human...

07:41.294 --> 07:42.753
Frat boys.

07:50.011 --> 07:52.180
So, when did your mom
come from Naltor?

07:52.263 --> 07:53.973
When she was 18.

07:54.056 --> 07:57.602
The night before she fled her planet,
she had a dream about a farmhouse

07:57.685 --> 07:58.936
where she would meet her true love.

07:59.312 --> 08:02.148
And she saw
a bunch of random coordinates

08:02.231 --> 08:05.693
that she plugged into her craft,
and she landed on Earth in Parthas.

08:05.776 --> 08:08.571
A human family took her in, farmers.

08:09.614 --> 08:11.032
And she fell in love with their son.
-My dad.
-Wow.

08:13.159 --> 08:16.787
Yeah. I can't imagine
having grown up anywhere else.

08:16.871 --> 08:19.332
Because you have parents
from two different planets?

08:19.415 --> 08:21.626
Yeah, but also because I'm trans.

08:22.460 --> 08:25.004
I always knew that I was a girl.

08:25.087 --> 08:28.007
My parents were amazing.
They affirmed my authentic self,

08:28.090 --> 08:30.218
and helped me transition young.

08:30.301 --> 08:33.763
I've always been able to be open
about who I was in Parthas.

08:33.846 --> 08:34.931
I'm not saying it was easy.

08:35.014 --> 08:38.184
There were definitely people
who didn't understand.

08:39.685 --> 08:42.021
But the town's ethos
of inclusion is strong.

08:42.104 --> 08:44.482
And I think if I grew up anywhere else,

08:44.565 --> 08:45.983
it would've been a lot tougher.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.444
Thank you for sharing that with me.

08:49.028 --> 08:50.071
Of course.

08:50.863 --> 08:53.491
Just one other thing,
when you meet my family,

08:53.574 --> 08:56.160
please don't mention
the dreaming powers.

08:56.911 --> 08:58.829
It's just that I haven't told them yet.

08:58.913 --> 09:02.542
And I've never
kept a secret from my sister.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.544
It's been weighing on me.

09:04.669 --> 09:06.212
Yeah, I know that feeling.

09:07.129 --> 09:08.172
I won't say a word.

09:08.881 --> 09:10.007
Thank you.

09:11.050 --> 09:12.468
Good thing I drove.

09:12.552 --> 09:13.844
Yeah, good thing.

09:14.971 --> 09:18.432
We found traces of an unknown drug
with alien markers in your system.

09:18.516 --> 09:20.434
What is it and where did you get it?

09:20.518 --> 09:22.728
Aspirin. From a bottle.

09:22.853 --> 09:25.273
Man, it's the same stuff
we take all the freaking time.

09:26.065 --> 09:28.693
This time, it was different.

09:28.776 --> 09:29.819
Different how?

09:29.902 --> 09:32.697
All I felt was rage,
and not the fun kind.

09:33.114 --> 09:34.448
They usually just make you happy.

09:34.865 --> 09:36.993
-Bad batch, I guess.
-Are we in trouble?

09:37.076 --> 09:39.870
I have you on six counts of assault.
So, yeah.

09:39.954 --> 09:42.790
But if you give me the name
of your dealer, maybe we can talk.

09:42.873 --> 09:47.169
How about I give you
the name of my lawyer, Narc?

09:52.675 --> 09:54.969
-Are you okay?
-Yeah... No.

09:55.886 --> 09:58.306
No, those idiots in there,
they can't pass freshman comp,

09:58.389 --> 10:01.058
and yet I couldn't crack them. Why?

10:01.475 --> 10:02.810
I don't have that answer.

10:03.811 --> 10:07.440
But I do know
why our Jekylls became Hydes.

10:07.523 --> 10:09.150
The substance they ingested

10:09.233 --> 10:13.070
was radicalized by 15-to-the-19th
power hertz worth of gamma rays.

10:13.154 --> 10:15.031
Someone irradiated their party drug?

10:15.114 --> 10:17.575
What happened to you, little guys?

10:17.658 --> 10:19.410
Why did you get so angry, huh?

10:19.493 --> 10:20.620
Doesn't matter why.

10:21.078 --> 10:23.623
All that matters
is how we capitalize on it.

10:23.706 --> 10:27.126
Here, check this out!
16,000 views just in the last hour.

10:27.793 --> 10:30.379
16,000? Holy...

10:31.255 --> 10:32.256
We're famous.

10:32.340 --> 10:34.675
No. No, we're rich.
Here, check out the comments.

10:35.718 --> 10:38.763
"I'll have what they're having."
Sue in Connecticut.

10:38.846 --> 10:41.349
"I'd pay my entire bonus for that."

10:41.432 --> 10:43.601
Yeah, Sam R. in East City!

10:43.684 --> 10:45.186
We have the supply.

10:45.269 --> 10:46.979
Shoot, let's go meet our demand.

10:52.568 --> 10:54.820
Jerry. Why are we going?

10:54.904 --> 10:56.322
Just chill, Little Squeak.

10:56.405 --> 11:01.369
We're about to be so rich, you're
gonna be like, "College? What?"

11:01.494 --> 11:02.745
My name is Bobbi.

11:02.870 --> 11:03.913
Hey, Bobbi.

11:04.914 --> 11:08.459
I'm doing this for us. Just...
Just trust me, okay?

11:50.626 --> 11:53.003
-Gosh. Are you okay?

11:54.004 --> 11:55.214
Were you dreaming?

11:55.297 --> 11:56.298
No.

12:02.596 --> 12:04.765
-This is home.
-It's so pretty.

12:12.314 --> 12:14.275
Nia! Oh!

12:14.358 --> 12:15.359
Honey.

12:17.820 --> 12:20.114
-You look famished.
-She looks lovely.

12:20.197 --> 12:21.782
-As always.
- Hi.

12:21.866 --> 12:23.325
And chic.

12:23.409 --> 12:24.618
Who is this city girl?

12:24.910 --> 12:27.037
What has she done with my sister?

12:27.663 --> 12:32.293
Maeve, Mom, Dad, I want you to meet
my friend and boss, Kara Danvers.

12:32.376 --> 12:33.669
Nice to meet you.

12:33.752 --> 12:35.254
Kara, we're so delighted you came.

12:35.337 --> 12:36.881
-Your home is beautiful.
-Thank you.

12:36.964 --> 12:39.592
-Kara, you like radishes?
-Yeah.

12:39.675 --> 12:42.720
-Isabel's radishes are legendary.
-Okay. Okay.

12:42.803 --> 12:45.347
And the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.475
Maeve's got all her mom's gifts.

12:47.558 --> 12:48.642
Look at her orchids.

12:48.726 --> 12:49.852
Mom's a natural.

12:49.935 --> 12:53.481
I've labored to memorize
the 30,000 species of orchids.

12:53.564 --> 12:56.734
Sweetheart, you've been a prodigy
since you were in diapers.

12:56.817 --> 12:59.320
More like your protege
since I was in diapers.

13:03.824 --> 13:05.409
Nia.

13:05.493 --> 13:08.329
Mom's teaching me Japanese ink
wash painting. That was my ink.

13:09.497 --> 13:12.291
I'm sorry. I don't know why I did that.

13:12.374 --> 13:13.667
I think you're tired.

13:13.751 --> 13:16.545
We had a long drive,
and she's definitely famished.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.672
Paul, is that paella?

13:18.756 --> 13:21.217
I can't believe our Nia works at CatCo.

13:21.300 --> 13:22.801
You've read Cat's book how many times?

13:22.885 --> 13:24.803
-Fourteen?
-Really?

13:24.887 --> 13:25.888
More like 40.

13:27.389 --> 13:29.934
It was always Nia's dream
to be a journalist.

13:30.017 --> 13:32.478
To be in the center of things,
to effect change.

13:32.686 --> 13:35.356
Some of us actually like it
far from the madding crowd.

13:35.439 --> 13:37.983
-So, you live here in Parthas?
-I live just down the street.

13:38.067 --> 13:40.694
I apprentice with Mom,
and I own a painting studio.

13:40.778 --> 13:44.573
I've been staring at these paintings
all day.

13:45.324 --> 13:46.992
-Are they yours?
- They are Mom's.

13:47.076 --> 13:48.202
She paints her dreams.

13:48.911 --> 13:52.122
So will I,
once my dreams finally kick in.

13:52.206 --> 13:53.832
You can't rush things, honey.

13:54.625 --> 13:57.545
Has Nia told you about
our strange family legacy, Kara?

13:58.128 --> 13:59.630
The otherworldly dreaming powers?

13:59.755 --> 14:01.173
She's mentioned it.

14:01.257 --> 14:04.343
Dreaming the future is passed down
on the matrilineal line.

14:04.927 --> 14:07.555
One woman from every generation
inherits the gift.

14:07.638 --> 14:10.015
-Just one?
-Yeah. Just one.

14:10.766 --> 14:13.519
Unless, of course,
she's cursed with future blindness.

14:14.353 --> 14:16.522
In which case, it skips a generation.

14:16.605 --> 14:18.524
That's not going
to happen, Maeve.

14:18.607 --> 14:20.276
I told you,
when I was pregnant with you,

14:20.359 --> 14:22.319
I dreamt that
my daughter would have the gift.

14:22.403 --> 14:23.779
Just give it time.

14:29.743 --> 14:31.537
There are reports of
two more rage attacks.

14:32.621 --> 14:34.164
It's spreading.

14:34.248 --> 14:36.083
We need to get more teams
out there immediately.

14:36.166 --> 14:41.171
Copy. Also, it appears
these outbursts were intentional.

14:41.672 --> 14:43.883
People are buying this drug on purpose?

14:44.717 --> 14:46.010
How? And why?

14:48.804 --> 14:52.182
I should have been ahead of this.
Brainy, I'm off.

14:53.058 --> 14:54.476
Something is wrong with me.

14:54.560 --> 14:57.688
It's like something in my mind,
it's missing.

15:02.985 --> 15:04.778
J'onn, thank you for coming.

15:04.862 --> 15:06.780
Sure. You sounded panicked on the phone.

15:06.864 --> 15:08.198
Is everything all right?

15:08.282 --> 15:09.742
I'm not thinking clearly,

15:10.492 --> 15:12.328
and I can't afford
to be making mistakes.

15:12.411 --> 15:14.288
-How can I help?
-Scan me.

15:14.371 --> 15:15.664
My mind.

15:19.793 --> 15:20.920
Why?

15:21.670 --> 15:23.172
Something is wrong with me, J'onn.

15:23.839 --> 15:27.593
I don't know how to describe it,
I just feel disconnected.

15:28.135 --> 15:29.678
I feel vulnerable.

15:31.263 --> 15:33.682
Look, what if something went wrong
when I underwent the Truth Seeker?

15:34.475 --> 15:37.019
I know there's not supposed to be
side effects or anything,

15:37.102 --> 15:38.395
but that's when this began.

15:39.146 --> 15:41.315
I just need to know that I'm okay.

15:41.398 --> 15:44.068
And if I'm not okay, I just need
to know that I'm not crazy.

15:44.568 --> 15:45.736
Please, J'onn.

15:50.491 --> 15:53.285
-This is Maeve's old room.
-It's so pretty.

15:55.079 --> 15:58.582
<i>Jung and Dreams, Lexicon of Dreams...</i>

15:59.166 --> 16:01.877
Well, I understand
why you haven't told Maeve

16:01.961 --> 16:03.128
that you inherited the powers.

16:03.212 --> 16:05.172
Right? It's a disaster.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.341
I never even wanted the powers.

16:07.424 --> 16:09.051
I always wanted to be out in the world,

16:09.802 --> 16:11.887
reporting, helping people.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.223
Well, you can help people
in a big way with your powers.

16:14.306 --> 16:16.850
Maeve's been studying the language
of dreams her whole life.
This is all she's ever wanted.

16:20.854 --> 16:22.356
This will break her heart.

16:22.439 --> 16:25.859
If the powers are only passed to
one daughter per generation,

16:26.318 --> 16:28.112
why are they so sure that it's Maeve?

16:28.195 --> 16:29.655
You heard my mom.

16:30.239 --> 16:31.740
When she was pregnant with Maeve,

16:31.824 --> 16:34.451
she dreamt that
her daughter would be the Dreamer.

16:35.911 --> 16:39.707
Believe me, I know how hard it is
to hurt your sister,

16:41.083 --> 16:42.543
but I think you should tell her.

16:42.626 --> 16:43.877
I'm going to talk to my mom.

16:44.753 --> 16:46.130
I'm gonna see if there's a way

16:46.213 --> 16:49.383
that I can transfer the powers
to Maeve somehow.

16:49.466 --> 16:50.843
I don't think it works like that.

16:50.926 --> 16:52.761
Could you just talk to my sister?

16:52.845 --> 16:55.347
Interview her for your article?

16:55.431 --> 16:58.350
Just buy me some time with my mom?

17:00.561 --> 17:02.396
Okay. Of course.
The mind wipe should be untraceable.

17:04.398 --> 17:05.524
But it's possible because

17:05.607 --> 17:07.985
Alex's relationship with Supergirl
is unlike anyone else's.

17:08.652 --> 17:10.195
Her encounter with the Truth Seeker

17:10.279 --> 17:12.489
may have left her
with an unidentifiable itch.

17:12.573 --> 17:15.325
You can't tell her that Supergirl's
identity has been removed.

17:15.743 --> 17:18.454
Haley is still on a mission
to find out who Supergirl is.

17:18.537 --> 17:19.872
I know. I know.

17:19.955 --> 17:23.083
But sometimes,
a placebo can be very effective.

17:25.502 --> 17:26.587
You're going to lie to her.

17:26.670 --> 17:28.088
I don't want to.

17:28.172 --> 17:30.090
But maybe it'll bring her peace of mind,

17:30.549 --> 17:31.842
help her heal.

17:38.474 --> 17:40.350
-Are you ready?
-Yeah.

17:40.851 --> 17:42.019
Thanks for doing this, J'onn.

17:43.854 --> 17:45.189
-All right.
-Okay.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.706
You're fine. Everything is normal.

18:02.790 --> 18:05.626
Really? Thank God.

18:06.126 --> 18:07.336
Okay.

18:07.419 --> 18:09.463
Perhaps the stress
you're feeling at work

18:09.546 --> 18:10.964
is the lack of a partner.

18:11.590 --> 18:13.092
A good cop to your bad cop.

18:15.636 --> 18:19.556
Or maybe, I need the opposite of a cop.

18:21.266 --> 18:24.186
Brainy, how are your acting skills?

18:27.815 --> 18:30.818
Wow, I never thought
I'd be quoted in CatCo.

18:32.444 --> 18:35.489
So, tell me what it's like
to live in Parthas?

18:35.572 --> 18:37.157
Most people from Parthas never leave.

18:37.616 --> 18:38.784
Nia's one of the few.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.828
-She's fearless.

18:41.787 --> 18:43.372
I've always been envious of that.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.833
We all have our own gifts.

18:47.042 --> 18:49.461
My mom chose to use her gifts
to nurture this town.

18:49.878 --> 18:54.091
But my grandmother, on Naltor,
she was the hero of the planet.

18:54.550 --> 18:55.634
Like Supergirl.

18:56.051 --> 19:00.180
When my powers kick in,
I want to be that kind of hero.

19:01.390 --> 19:07.229
Well, I think maybe being a hero
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

19:12.609 --> 19:15.070
Children of Liberty? Here?

19:15.154 --> 19:16.864
Every year at Harvest Fest,

19:16.947 --> 19:19.491
jerks from neighboring towns
come and protest.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.953
They hate humans and aliens mixing.

19:24.371 --> 19:26.081
When you have something good,

19:26.790 --> 19:29.042
there's always going to be
people who want to tear it down.

19:30.711 --> 19:34.131
Don't worry, the citizens of Parthas
can take care of themselves.

19:49.062 --> 19:50.856
-Bros?
-Who are you?

19:52.482 --> 19:56.904
We met last night at your humble abode.

19:57.988 --> 20:01.283
-Sick rager, BT-dubs.
-Why are you in here?

20:01.366 --> 20:07.831
Like you, I scored some of that
sweet, sweet rage candy.

20:08.582 --> 20:09.750
The next thing I know,

20:09.833 --> 20:11.835
I'm tossed in here
with you fine gentlemen.

20:11.919 --> 20:14.504
Well, whatever you do,
don't breathe a word to that witch.

20:14.588 --> 20:16.715
Of course not. I would never.

20:22.888 --> 20:24.640
Perhaps, once we're out,

20:24.723 --> 20:29.811
we could find some more
of those rage pills and, well, rage.

20:29.895 --> 20:31.813
No, I'm done with that stuff.

20:31.897 --> 20:34.024
Besides, if Jerry and Kev are smart,

20:34.107 --> 20:36.443
they jumped in that van
and got the hell out of town.

20:36.526 --> 20:38.070
Jerry and Kev.

20:41.782 --> 20:43.033
That was easy.

20:43.492 --> 20:46.078
Impressive. It took you less than
two minutes to get that information.

20:46.161 --> 20:48.956
How did you learn to speak Dude-Bro?

20:49.039 --> 20:51.583
The same way they did. The movies.

20:51.667 --> 20:54.878
Well, thank you. Both of you.
For everything.

20:54.962 --> 20:56.213
Yeah.

20:56.296 --> 20:58.840
Now, let's catch these guys
before they can do any more damage.

20:59.216 --> 21:00.801
I miss you so much.

21:01.093 --> 21:04.096
I can never understand how you
enjoy living in that concrete jungle.

21:04.763 --> 21:06.890
There's a life force to the city.

21:06.974 --> 21:09.601
It's not the same as nature,
but it's alive.

21:09.810 --> 21:12.854
Hmm. You seem in tune
with the energy of the city.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.481
It suits you.

21:14.564 --> 21:15.899
Thanks.

21:19.778 --> 21:22.072
Mom, speaking of energy, um...
I was talking to Kara
about the dream powers,

21:25.784 --> 21:28.203
and she was wondering,
just out of curiosity,

21:28.287 --> 21:31.248
if you didn't want the powers
when you were my age,

21:31.873 --> 21:34.126
was there a way that
you could've refused them?

21:34.793 --> 21:35.794
No.

21:35.877 --> 21:37.879
But what if you really
didn't want to use them?

21:38.964 --> 21:41.758
What if you needed
to direct them to somebody else?

21:42.175 --> 21:43.468
The Dreamer is destined.

21:45.554 --> 21:47.055
The chosen one doesn't have a choice.

21:47.139 --> 21:48.473
It's in her blood.

21:55.772 --> 21:57.524
Mom? Mom?

22:00.819 --> 22:03.322
No, it bit you. Mom? Mom?

22:03.655 --> 22:04.656
Mom?

22:05.824 --> 22:07.784
Nia, it's you.

22:09.286 --> 22:10.329
Oh, my God.

22:10.787 --> 22:12.122
Mom, what's happening?

22:12.205 --> 22:13.915
You're in my dream.

22:15.625 --> 22:16.752
I'm dying, my love.

22:18.670 --> 22:19.796
You are the next Dreamer.

22:19.880 --> 22:21.548
No, no.

22:21.631 --> 22:23.425
Of course it's you. It had to be you.

22:24.509 --> 22:26.053
I'm sorry I was so blind.

22:27.596 --> 22:30.557
My dream of my daughter with powers...

22:32.684 --> 22:33.894
I never saw her face.

22:33.977 --> 22:35.353
Mom, I don't care about that.

22:35.437 --> 22:38.231
-I'm not ready for you to go.
-You are ready.

22:40.692 --> 22:44.112
My element was water. Yours is fire.

22:46.073 --> 22:49.576
And your fire will make you
far more powerful than I ever was.

22:52.913 --> 22:54.998
It was your destiny to be my daughter.

22:56.750 --> 22:58.085
To be Dreamer.

23:00.128 --> 23:03.715
Life put you through many trials
just to be who you are.

23:05.801 --> 23:07.260
It made you strong.

23:08.762 --> 23:11.807
That strength will serve you well
as a hero.

23:13.892 --> 23:14.935
My Nia.

23:22.234 --> 23:23.401
<i>Nia.</i>

23:23.485 --> 23:24.820
Nia. Wake up.

23:25.403 --> 23:26.613
She's not breathing. Mom, mom?

23:32.202 --> 23:33.995
I'm so sorry.

24:04.860 --> 24:07.237
Nia. You've got to get up.

24:08.780 --> 24:10.031
Word has spread about Mom,

24:10.115 --> 24:13.910
and the town's turning Harvest Fest
into an impromptu memorial.

24:13.994 --> 24:16.454
-I can't zip this dress.
-Let me help you.

24:22.085 --> 24:23.295
It's my fault.

24:24.713 --> 24:26.840
I should have gotten
the powers by now, Nia.

24:28.091 --> 24:29.467
It doesn't make sense.

24:30.218 --> 24:31.344
I mean, maybe...

24:32.596 --> 24:34.097
Maybe I'm doing something wrong.

24:34.890 --> 24:36.558
Of course you're not
doing anything wrong.

24:36.641 --> 24:37.726
I must be.

24:38.602 --> 24:42.230
If I had the powers, I would have
dreamed Mom was in danger.

24:42.314 --> 24:43.440
I could have prevented it.

24:43.523 --> 24:45.233
Even if you had a dream,

24:45.317 --> 24:47.903
you don't know if you could have
interpreted it--

24:47.986 --> 24:49.154
Of course I could have.

24:50.071 --> 24:52.908
I'm fluent in dream interpretation.

24:52.991 --> 24:56.119
I would have been forewarned
about Mom, I would have...

24:57.996 --> 24:59.581
I would have saved her.

25:04.294 --> 25:05.754
You've got to get dressed.

25:09.382 --> 25:11.343
- Yeah, James. I'm over here.

25:11.885 --> 25:13.720
Hey, Lena, I want to talk to you
about something.

25:17.140 --> 25:18.225
What's that?

25:19.392 --> 25:20.894
-Game night training.

25:20.977 --> 25:24.981
What? Okay, listen, some couples need
to work on their communication skills

25:25.065 --> 25:27.984
and others need to work
on their competitive trivia skills.

25:29.027 --> 25:31.488
You and I are deeply connected,
Mr. Olsen.

25:31.571 --> 25:33.573
We just need our game night
performance to reflect that.

25:33.657 --> 25:35.617
-And you hate to lose.
-And I hate to lose.

25:36.660 --> 25:37.702
So, are you in?

25:39.955 --> 25:42.082
-I'm all in.
-Excellent. All right, first up,

25:42.165 --> 25:43.500
Trivial Pursuit Classic Rock Edition.

25:44.167 --> 25:47.337
Wait, hold on. What was it
you wanted to talk to me about?

25:49.547 --> 25:50.757
It can wait.

25:54.552 --> 25:56.012
Seven, eight...

25:57.555 --> 25:59.808
We just missed our turn.
I thought you said we were done.

25:59.891 --> 26:01.351
Change of plans, Little Squeak.

26:02.102 --> 26:05.105
We got an offer we couldn't resist.
Ten thousand in cold, hard cash.

26:16.074 --> 26:18.243
Hang tight. We'll be right back, okay?

26:21.871 --> 26:23.373
Hello, good sir.

26:23.707 --> 26:25.834
My name is Kevin, this is my associate.

26:25.917 --> 26:26.918
You have the stuff?

26:27.961 --> 26:29.212
Do you have the cash?

26:41.850 --> 26:43.935
-Come on, boys. We got what we need.

26:44.978 --> 26:47.397
Let's get to that festival
and harvest these roaches.

27:12.339 --> 27:14.758
-Hey, Brainy.
-Greetings, J'onn.

27:14.841 --> 27:17.510
I came to see how Alex was feeling.
Have you seen her?

27:18.011 --> 27:19.095
I have not.

27:19.179 --> 27:22.140
But I have located our dealers' van.

27:23.224 --> 27:24.642
Brainy, that's great.

27:25.268 --> 27:27.437
I have also located Director Danvers.

27:28.021 --> 27:30.273
A day of many victories.

27:30.357 --> 27:32.984
Now, at first, I found no vehicle
registered to our suspects,

27:33.068 --> 27:36.196
and I thought, perhaps,
Spence was lying.

27:36.279 --> 27:38.156
Which would be so like him.

27:38.239 --> 27:39.824
But then I found this...

27:39.908 --> 27:40.992
Originally registered to

27:41.076 --> 27:42.952
a Mrs. Veronica "Roni" Miller,
now deceased.

27:43.036 --> 27:45.663
The title has then passed
to Roberta Miller,

27:45.747 --> 27:47.791
Jerry Miller's little sister.

27:47.874 --> 27:50.251
Good work.
All right, let's move, people.

27:51.086 --> 27:54.130
Hey, you wanna take advantage
while the cat's away and roll with?

27:54.381 --> 27:56.591
With all this rage going on,
we could use a man of peace.

27:56.758 --> 28:01.596
-Sure. You seem better.
-I am. Thanks to you.

28:08.353 --> 28:10.647
I'm supposed to wear
one of Maeve's dresses?

28:11.398 --> 28:12.982
What else am I going to take from her?

28:13.066 --> 28:14.609
You can't blame yourself for this.

28:16.444 --> 28:17.654
I lied.

28:19.239 --> 28:20.782
I did have a dream on the car ride.

28:22.575 --> 28:26.413
I dreamt my mom drank an inky
black fluid, and turned into ash.

28:27.038 --> 28:28.957
That's why I trashed
Maeve's art supplies.

28:30.125 --> 28:32.627
But I took the poison ink literally.

28:34.462 --> 28:37.132
It was only a symbol of death.

28:37.215 --> 28:38.883
I would have known that

28:38.967 --> 28:41.261
if I had bothered to study,
like my sister.

28:42.804 --> 28:48.101
There were all these other symbols,
things I couldn't decode, cobwebs.

28:49.894 --> 28:54.149
Tons of cobwebs. Spiders spin webs.

28:55.483 --> 28:58.111
I should've known that
the ink was only a symbol,

28:58.194 --> 28:59.779
that the spiders were the real danger.

28:59.863 --> 29:02.407
Maeve would've known that.
Maeve should have gotten the powers.

29:02.490 --> 29:04.367
Nia, don't do this to yourself.

29:04.951 --> 29:06.953
I can't ever tell her I have them.

29:07.036 --> 29:10.498
Hey. Please, listen to me.
Keeping a secret from your sister

29:10.582 --> 29:13.501
will only hurt you
more than anything else.

29:15.086 --> 29:16.713
You didn't take anything from her.

29:16.796 --> 29:18.882
You didn't choose to be
the sister with powers.

29:18.965 --> 29:20.675
In time, she'll understand that.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.927
But right now,
you have to be honest with her.

29:26.473 --> 29:27.599
You're right.

29:29.976 --> 29:31.186
I'll tell her.

29:32.812 --> 29:34.647
After the memorial.

29:44.574 --> 29:45.950
I was certain this was

29:46.034 --> 29:48.745
the last confirmed location
of Roberta Miller's van.

29:48.828 --> 29:50.413
I think it was.

29:50.497 --> 29:52.373
Looks like somebody
already did your job for you.

29:52.457 --> 29:54.667
Jerry Miller? Kevin Huggins?

29:54.751 --> 29:57.086
You're under arrest for selling
an unidentified alien substance.

29:57.170 --> 29:58.296
Search them.

29:58.379 --> 30:00.507
No, you won't find anything.
We were robbed.

30:00.590 --> 30:02.634
-By who?
-I don't know.

30:02.717 --> 30:05.386
They said something about attacking
some alien festival?

30:05.470 --> 30:07.263
This is what I was afraid of.

30:07.347 --> 30:09.057
Brainy, take 'em in.

30:09.140 --> 30:10.558
No, no, no. Wait, wait. Please.
My little sister...

30:10.642 --> 30:12.018
She took the van and went after them.

30:12.101 --> 30:14.896
-Why would she do that?
-I don't know, to defend me?

30:14.979 --> 30:16.147
To get revenge?

30:16.231 --> 30:17.732
She was mad.

30:18.358 --> 30:20.401
She bailed out
and didn't even stop for us.

30:21.402 --> 30:23.738
Who knew that Squeak had that much rage?

30:23.822 --> 30:24.948
I did.

30:25.031 --> 30:26.199
Bobbi's sensitive.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.117
People prey on that, you know?

30:28.910 --> 30:32.080
She got pushed around at school,
got pushed around at home, too.

30:32.163 --> 30:33.456
It'd make anyone angry.

31:01.818 --> 31:04.988
Maeve, why don't
you and Kara go on ahead?

31:05.071 --> 31:06.239
We'll catch up.
What's this?

31:20.420 --> 31:25.717
This is going to sound strange,
but I had a dream last night.

31:27.343 --> 31:30.930
Your mom came to me,
said this was for you.

31:38.021 --> 31:40.481
In Parthas, when someone passes,

31:40.565 --> 31:43.067
we wear white to honor
the light in each of us.

31:44.027 --> 31:45.945
Humans and aliens alike.

31:47.155 --> 31:50.116
Anyone who met my mom
knows her light was blinding.

31:51.576 --> 31:54.954
I'm so lucky I got to bask in it
every single day.

31:56.539 --> 31:58.917
And I'm so lucky to follow
in her footsteps,

32:00.293 --> 32:03.630
continue her work,
carry on her legacy...

32:06.382 --> 32:07.467
Maeve, watch out!

32:27.654 --> 32:28.821
Maeve!

32:30.281 --> 32:32.367
You knew that axe
was going to hit the podium.

32:33.368 --> 32:34.535
You have the powers.

32:34.619 --> 32:35.954
-I can explain.
-Don't touch me.

32:52.637 --> 32:55.181
Help! Help!

32:55.932 --> 32:58.309
It's blocked. Come this way.
It's blocked.

32:59.310 --> 33:00.561
Keep your heads down.

33:27.630 --> 33:28.881
Detain all aggressors.

33:29.048 --> 33:30.383
J'onn, get the people out of that barn.

33:31.843 --> 33:33.011
Hey!

33:46.482 --> 33:49.485
Bobbi Miller? Hey! Let her go!

33:50.278 --> 33:52.989
I said, let her go.
This is your final warning.

33:53.156 --> 33:55.575
No! Director Danvers, don't!

34:15.470 --> 34:19.015
Supergirl, you struck an agent
of the United States military.

34:19.098 --> 34:21.267
And you were about to shoot down
an innocent alien.

34:21.350 --> 34:24.687
I was containing a volatile alien,
and you interfered.

34:24.771 --> 34:27.065
That alien was just defending his home.

34:27.148 --> 34:30.651
These Children of Liberty wannabes
were provoking him.

34:30.735 --> 34:33.362
They attacked a peaceful memorial.

34:33.446 --> 34:35.740
Your word no longer works for us.

34:35.823 --> 34:37.700
And I have a job to do.

34:37.784 --> 34:39.494
That's to uncover all of the facts.

34:39.577 --> 34:43.289
And that girl,
she is not a Child of Liberty,

34:43.372 --> 34:46.709
she's just a kid who took a drug
to fuel her rage.

34:49.128 --> 34:51.464
-Why would someone--
-Because this world is filled

34:51.547 --> 34:54.425
with a lot of people that are
bigger and stronger than her.

34:54.509 --> 34:57.804
And that kind of vulnerability,
it makes you angry.

34:58.638 --> 35:00.056
And when you feel powerless enough,

35:00.139 --> 35:03.101
you'll do anything it takes
to feel strong.

35:03.184 --> 35:04.477
I can understand that.

35:04.560 --> 35:10.274
Really? How? You are literally
described as the Girl of Steel.

35:11.776 --> 35:14.403
On the outside and the in.

35:15.947 --> 35:18.366
You really think I don't know
what it feels like to be vulnerable?

35:18.491 --> 35:20.409
No, I don't.

35:21.327 --> 35:24.622
Now, you either stand down,
or I will arrest you, too.

35:26.124 --> 35:27.416
Come on.

35:42.223 --> 35:45.226
I'm almost ready to go.
I just need to talk to my sister.

35:45.309 --> 35:46.727
-Of course. Here.
-Thanks.

35:47.812 --> 35:49.272
There's nothing to talk about.

35:50.273 --> 35:52.483
Maeve, I swear I was going to tell you.

35:52.567 --> 35:56.195
-Really? When?
-After the memorial service.

35:56.904 --> 35:58.156
You knew for months.

35:58.990 --> 36:00.741
For months you let me go on about

36:00.825 --> 36:03.286
how upset I was
that the powers hadn't kicked in yet.

36:03.995 --> 36:07.290
You let me humiliate myself,
think I was future blind...

36:07.373 --> 36:08.875
No. It wasn't like that.

36:10.084 --> 36:13.045
I was trying to transfer the powers
to you, somehow.

36:13.129 --> 36:14.297
Right.

36:15.590 --> 36:17.592
How did you, of all people,
get the powers?

36:17.675 --> 36:20.720
They're supposed to be passed down
from mother to daughter.

36:20.803 --> 36:23.681
So how did someone like you get them?
You're not even a real woman.

36:36.819 --> 36:39.614
Maeve was always
my biggest supporter.

36:39.697 --> 36:41.490
I can't believe
she'd say something like that.

36:42.033 --> 36:43.451
Nia, I'm so sorry.

36:43.534 --> 36:45.953
I knew she was gonna be crushed
about the powers, but...

36:51.209 --> 36:53.002
Gosh, she was so angry.

36:54.253 --> 36:55.588
I know it's not the same thing,

36:55.671 --> 36:56.964
but if it makes you feel any better,

36:57.048 --> 36:58.799
I've been through a lot with my sister.

36:58.883 --> 37:01.135
I appreciate your support,

37:01.219 --> 37:03.888
but this isn't something
that you can understand.

37:03.971 --> 37:07.141
I have alien powers, my sister doesn't.

37:07.225 --> 37:09.602
And now, she hates me.

37:16.651 --> 37:17.818
Why are you pulling over?

37:22.531 --> 37:24.742
Kara, what are you doing?

37:29.705 --> 37:30.998
I do understand.

37:31.916 --> 37:33.709
Probably better than anyone.

37:44.262 --> 37:46.889
I am Supergirl.

37:47.765 --> 37:49.850
Very few people know my true identity

37:49.934 --> 37:51.102
because it's not safe for them to.

37:51.185 --> 37:54.689
But I'm telling you
because I think it can help you.

37:55.231 --> 37:57.733
And I don't think it will harm you.

37:57.817 --> 38:00.820
You, too, are a hero.

38:00.903 --> 38:03.030
I was the sister with powers.

38:03.114 --> 38:06.450
And I watched Alex pay the price
for it in so many ways.

38:07.201 --> 38:09.412
Most of the time,
she handled it with grace, but,

38:09.495 --> 38:12.415
I'll tell you, there were some times
that it got ugly.

38:12.498 --> 38:14.041
When we were younger...

38:16.377 --> 38:17.628
And even now.

38:19.880 --> 38:20.965
But I have faith that

38:21.048 --> 38:23.342
the love between two sisters
will prevail in the end.

38:23.426 --> 38:24.802
I have to believe that.

38:25.344 --> 38:29.932
I just need you to know now
that you are not alone.

38:30.099 --> 38:34.020
You have a family. You have me.

38:37.523 --> 38:38.733
You wanted to see me, boss?

38:39.650 --> 38:40.943
Have a seat.

38:42.903 --> 38:44.071
Look, Mackenzie,

38:44.155 --> 38:48.034
I went over the materials
you sent me for L-Corp,

38:49.452 --> 38:50.953
and everything checks out.

38:52.455 --> 38:54.248
Everything is above board with the FDA.

38:54.874 --> 38:56.542
Oh. Uh...

38:57.418 --> 38:59.253
I guess my source was wrong.

39:00.421 --> 39:02.173
Weird, he's usually solid.

39:04.467 --> 39:05.968
Don't be so hard on yourself.

39:06.052 --> 39:08.220
Look, these things happen.
It's a learning process.

39:08.512 --> 39:10.056
But you were right to come to me first.

39:11.015 --> 39:12.183
You have great instincts.

39:43.798 --> 39:45.466
The mind wipe did change Alex.

39:45.925 --> 39:48.219
I thought lying to her
one more time would help,

39:48.844 --> 39:50.763
but it goes deeper than that.

39:50.846 --> 39:52.640
The disconnection was a symptom.

39:52.723 --> 39:54.767
Alex grew up with a sister
from another planet.

39:54.850 --> 39:56.227
A superhero.

39:56.769 --> 39:58.104
Without that memory,

39:58.938 --> 40:02.608
that exposure to other,
her perception has changed.

40:03.067 --> 40:04.985
-Her empathy has shifted.
-Why? I don't get it.

40:05.069 --> 40:07.363
She's close with plenty of other aliens.

40:07.446 --> 40:10.950
You were Alex's primary relationship
during her formative years.

40:11.033 --> 40:12.743
It's what formed her view of aliens.
And that's what we've erased.

40:15.746 --> 40:17.206
That blood memory.

40:17.289 --> 40:20.126
I have to believe that deep down,
she's still our Alex.

40:20.209 --> 40:22.837
We did what we had to do,
and now we have to be strong.

40:22.920 --> 40:24.046
For her.

40:24.130 --> 40:27.716
-Now this is exactly what I need.

40:28.551 --> 40:31.470
After the weekend I've had,
all I want to do is

40:31.554 --> 40:34.765
spend some time and relax
with my two favorite people

40:34.849 --> 40:36.517
and the greatest movie of all time.

40:36.600 --> 40:39.979
I'm not sure <i>The Terminator</i>
is relaxing, but okay.

40:40.062 --> 40:43.107
<i>-T2. </i>And it's comfort food.
-Your hand.

40:43.566 --> 40:45.109
Oh, yes.

40:45.192 --> 40:47.903
Well, that is a lovely parting gift
from Supergirl.

40:48.446 --> 40:50.030
I hope your weekend was better.

40:51.157 --> 40:53.200
Oh, J'onn said you were on assignment.
How did that go?

40:53.325 --> 40:56.704
Oh, the story I was following
didn't really pan out.

40:56.787 --> 40:59.790
Hey, how about we don't
actually talk about work tonight?

40:59.874 --> 41:01.584
-Yeah.
-I could do that.

41:01.667 --> 41:03.085
Now,

41:03.169 --> 41:05.629
watch the movie
if you don't want to die.

41:05.713 --> 41:09.258
-It's "If you want to live."

41:09.341 --> 41:11.927
-Oh, shoot.
-Oh, you goober.
