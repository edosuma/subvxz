WEBVTT

00:01.919 --> 00:05.339
Goo-goo-goo-goo.

00:05.380 --> 00:06.507
Look. Your Aunt Felicia

00:06.548 --> 00:08.049
sent us two presents

00:06.548 --> 00:08.049
for the baby.

00:08.091 --> 00:10.051
A ballerina outfit

00:08.091 --> 00:10.051
and a football?

00:10.093 --> 00:11.470
Well, I guess she's

00:10.093 --> 00:11.470
hedging her bets.

00:11.512 --> 00:13.347
I mean, Jamie could be

00:11.512 --> 00:13.347
a name for either sex.

00:13.388 --> 00:16.057
Well, I guess I'll just

00:13.388 --> 00:16.057
send this one to Goodwill.

00:16.099 --> 00:17.977
Oh, that's ridiculous.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.938
The birth announcement clearly

00:18.018 --> 00:20.938
said that Jamie's a... Hey.

00:20.980 --> 00:22.690
They changed the

00:20.980 --> 00:22.690
little dinosaur.

00:22.731 --> 00:24.650
That's right. All

00:22.731 --> 00:24.650
it takes is one look

00:24.692 --> 00:26.735
to see that Jamie

00:24.692 --> 00:26.735
is clearly a...

00:24.692 --> 00:26.735
(loud thump)

00:26.777 --> 00:28.487
Reese! For crying out loud!

00:28.529 --> 00:31.239
How can anyone

00:28.529 --> 00:31.239
not know what you are?

00:31.281 --> 00:33.074
Ooh-ooh.

REESE: Come on, Gordo.

01:12.364 --> 01:15.116
One more bite and it's all gone.

01:15.158 --> 01:17.202
What are you doing

01:15.158 --> 01:17.202
with my rabbit?

01:17.244 --> 01:19.120
Just giving him

01:17.244 --> 01:19.120
his afternoon bacon.

01:19.162 --> 01:20.622
He's too fat.

01:20.664 --> 01:22.290
You have to stop

01:20.664 --> 01:22.290
feeding him.

01:22.332 --> 01:23.751
I'm the one who has to sit

01:23.792 --> 01:25.419
through

01:23.792 --> 01:25.419
the Junior Farmers' meetings

01:25.460 --> 01:27.128
while everyone makes fun of him.

01:27.170 --> 01:28.630
Those people

01:27.170 --> 01:28.630
are small-minded idiots

01:28.672 --> 01:30.173
who have no idea what

01:28.672 --> 01:30.173
we're trying to do.

01:30.215 --> 01:32.009
What  are  we trying to do?

01:32.051 --> 01:33.134
I don't know.

01:33.176 --> 01:34.511
I kind of had this vision

01:34.553 --> 01:36.137
of me riding him

01:34.553 --> 01:36.137
through town,

01:36.179 --> 01:37.305
knocking over cars,

01:37.347 --> 01:39.850
but that's probably

01:37.347 --> 01:39.850
not realistic.

01:45.773 --> 01:47.024
What happened to you?

01:47.066 --> 01:48.525
Some idiot forgot

01:47.066 --> 01:48.525
to top off the oil

01:48.567 --> 01:50.151
in the tractor,

01:48.567 --> 01:50.151
and the whole damn engine blew.

01:50.193 --> 01:51.152
Well, whose job is that?

01:51.194 --> 01:52.529
Mine. I'm telling you,

01:52.571 --> 01:54.197
this whole ranch is a disaster.

01:54.239 --> 01:55.365
The furnace is clogged.

01:55.407 --> 01:56.951
The generator's out of diesel.

01:56.992 --> 01:59.160
Even the gate

01:56.992 --> 01:59.160
to the cow pen is falling apart.

01:59.202 --> 02:01.204
All those things

01:59.202 --> 02:01.204
are your responsibility.

02:01.246 --> 02:03.164
I don't know what's

02:01.246 --> 02:03.164
going on with you lately,

02:03.206 --> 02:05.166
but you'd better

02:03.206 --> 02:05.166
get it together.

02:05.208 --> 02:07.669
Otto's a pretty easygoing boss,

02:05.208 --> 02:07.669
but even he has limits.

02:07.711 --> 02:09.421
Fire! Fire! Francis, is a fire!

02:09.463 --> 02:11.172
What? Where?

02:11.214 --> 02:13.467
Right here on your

02:11.214 --> 02:13.467
cake. (laughs)

02:13.508 --> 02:15.970
God, it's been a year already?

02:16.011 --> 02:17.220
As of 9/31.

02:17.262 --> 02:20.181
So far, your first

02:17.262 --> 02:20.181
three hours of year two

02:20.223 --> 02:23.310
are going much better than

02:20.223 --> 02:23.310
I ever could have hoped.

02:34.237 --> 02:36.615
(Beethoven playing)

02:38.700 --> 02:39.910
Ooh!

02:48.836 --> 02:51.463
(shrieking, laughing)

02:53.256 --> 02:54.382
Congratulations.

02:54.424 --> 02:56.468
You won the jackpot.

03:08.063 --> 03:10.149
Oh, my God, would

03:08.063 --> 03:10.149
you look at this?

03:10.189 --> 03:12.526
What does Reese do

03:10.189 --> 03:12.526
to his underpants?

03:12.567 --> 03:14.862
There's not enough money

03:12.567 --> 03:14.862
in the world to make me look up.

03:14.903 --> 03:16.195
What's this?

03:17.196 --> 03:18.281
"Certificate of Achievement

03:18.323 --> 03:20.034
for Excellence in Science"?

03:20.075 --> 03:21.035
From the state?

03:21.076 --> 03:22.243
It's nothing.

03:21.076 --> 03:22.243
They hand

03:22.285 --> 03:23.244
these out like candy.

03:23.286 --> 03:24.287
Don't be so modest.

03:24.329 --> 03:25.246
It's wonderful,

03:25.288 --> 03:27.124
and I think it proves my point

03:27.166 --> 03:29.168
about you

03:27.166 --> 03:29.168
not getting that earring.

03:29.208 --> 03:30.627
How does that...?

03:29.208 --> 03:30.627
Malcolm.

03:30.669 --> 03:33.088
Malcolm, I need to talk to you.

03:33.130 --> 03:34.673
You read all those

03:33.130 --> 03:34.673
science magazines.

03:34.715 --> 03:35.674
What can you tell me

03:35.716 --> 03:37.051
about the meaning of dreams?

03:37.092 --> 03:38.177
Dreams?

03:38.218 --> 03:39.928
Well, some people think

03:38.218 --> 03:39.928
they express

03:39.970 --> 03:41.262
your subconscious wishes...

03:41.304 --> 03:42.263
No, no, no, no, no.

03:42.305 --> 03:43.431
The other kind of dreams,

03:43.473 --> 03:45.266
prophetic ones that

03:43.473 --> 03:45.266
predict the future.

03:45.308 --> 03:46.351
I had one.

03:46.393 --> 03:48.311
About a giant

03:46.393 --> 03:48.311
slot machine.

03:48.353 --> 03:49.688
That's insane, Dad.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.272
Oh, it was so vivid.

03:51.314 --> 03:53.274
There, there was this

03:51.314 --> 03:53.274
mysterious stain on my shirt

03:53.316 --> 03:55.318
an-and a balloon,

03:53.316 --> 03:55.318
and then this music

03:55.360 --> 03:57.487
and then I hit this

03:55.360 --> 03:57.487
gigantic jackpot.

03:57.529 --> 03:59.280
It was a sign, son. I know it.

03:59.322 --> 04:00.949
It's my destiny.

04:00.991 --> 04:02.283
Dad.

04:02.325 --> 04:04.285
You have weird dreams

04:02.325 --> 04:04.285
all the time.

04:04.327 --> 04:05.871
Like the singing trash cans.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.497
I never said

04:05.913 --> 04:07.497
that was prophetic.

04:07.539 --> 04:08.498
I said it was cool.

04:08.540 --> 04:09.833
(door closes)

04:11.793 --> 04:12.794
Well?

04:12.836 --> 04:13.754
What did they

04:12.836 --> 04:13.754
think of Gordo?

04:13.795 --> 04:15.296
They called him a monster.

04:15.338 --> 04:17.298
Then they called  me

04:15.338 --> 04:17.298
a crime against nature.

04:17.340 --> 04:19.176
Maybe it was the

04:17.340 --> 04:19.176
other way around.

04:19.218 --> 04:21.929
All I remember is,

04:19.218 --> 04:21.929
I was crying.

04:21.970 --> 04:24.681
You have to expect

04:21.970 --> 04:24.681
this kind of resistance

04:21.970 --> 04:24.681
when you're trying to play God.

04:24.723 --> 04:27.308
Just wait till we get

04:24.723 --> 04:27.308
to the nationals.

04:24.723 --> 04:27.308
Then we'll get some respect.

04:27.350 --> 04:29.895
We're not going

04:27.350 --> 04:29.895
to the nationals!

04:29.937 --> 04:32.355
They're all the way

04:29.937 --> 04:32.355
in Las Vegas!

04:32.397 --> 04:33.481
Las Vegas?!

04:33.523 --> 04:34.942
What's in Las Vegas?

04:34.983 --> 04:36.401
A chance for Reese

04:34.983 --> 04:36.401
to make me look

04:36.443 --> 04:38.570
like a jerk in front

04:36.443 --> 04:38.570
of the entire country.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.114
Well, don't you

04:38.612 --> 04:40.114
worry, son.

04:40.155 --> 04:41.322
We won't

04:40.155 --> 04:41.322
miss that.

04:41.364 --> 04:43.033
Of course we'll

04:41.364 --> 04:43.033
go to Vegas!

04:43.075 --> 04:45.827
Did you hear that, Malcolm?

04:43.075 --> 04:45.827
This is another sign!

04:45.869 --> 04:47.537
All I have to do is cash in

04:45.869 --> 04:47.537
our life insurance policy

04:47.579 --> 04:48.830
to pay for the trip...

04:48.872 --> 04:50.165
Dad, are you sure

04:48.872 --> 04:50.165
you want to...?

04:50.207 --> 04:51.332
Son, you don't need

04:50.207 --> 04:51.332
life insurance

04:51.374 --> 04:53.127
when you're a kajillionaire.

04:53.168 --> 04:54.419
It doesn't make fiscal sense.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.337
Maybe you want

04:54.461 --> 04:56.337
to run your plan by Mom first.

04:56.379 --> 04:57.422
I will. I will.

04:57.464 --> 04:59.340
I just want

04:57.464 --> 04:59.340
to be careful about it.

04:59.382 --> 05:01.260
But if I explain it

05:01.301 --> 05:02.552
in just the right way...

05:02.594 --> 05:04.846
A $1,000 bonus from work.

05:04.888 --> 05:07.808
Hal, I am so proud of you.

05:07.849 --> 05:10.978
Hey, considering

05:07.849 --> 05:10.978
the $12 million I saved them

05:11.019 --> 05:11.979
with my idea for

05:12.020 --> 05:15.149
outsourcing flux capacitors,

05:15.190 --> 05:16.357
it was the least they can do.

05:16.399 --> 05:18.359
And part of that roast

05:16.399 --> 05:18.359
is for you, Malcolm...

05:18.401 --> 05:20.570
Mr. State

05:18.401 --> 05:20.570
Science Achievement.

05:20.612 --> 05:21.989
Yeah, it, it was nothing.

05:22.030 --> 05:23.240
Is that what

05:22.030 --> 05:23.240
that big ceremony

05:23.282 --> 05:24.449
at school was for?

05:24.491 --> 05:25.867
Reese!

05:25.909 --> 05:27.368
What ceremony?

05:25.909 --> 05:27.368
There was a ceremony?

05:27.410 --> 05:28.578
Yeah, the mayor

05:27.410 --> 05:28.578
was there,

05:28.620 --> 05:30.038
and we all

05:28.620 --> 05:30.038
got out of school.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.290
Stop kicking me!

05:31.331 --> 05:32.457
I'll get to the news crew

05:31.331 --> 05:32.457
in a second.

05:32.499 --> 05:33.834
Malcolm, how

05:32.499 --> 05:33.834
could you not

05:33.875 --> 05:35.252
tell us about something

05:33.875 --> 05:35.252
so important?

05:35.294 --> 05:36.544
We're your parents!

05:36.586 --> 05:38.379
You're overreacting.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.379
It wasn't a big deal.

05:38.421 --> 05:40.381
That's not for you to decide!

05:40.423 --> 05:42.383
How can you be so selfish?

05:42.425 --> 05:43.384
I wasn't being selfish.

05:43.426 --> 05:44.385
I just didn't

05:43.426 --> 05:44.385
want you there

05:44.427 --> 05:45.887
because you em...

05:45.929 --> 05:49.057
(slow-motion voice):

05:45.929 --> 05:49.057
...barrass...

05:49.099 --> 05:51.392
(normal voice):

05:49.099 --> 05:51.392
Abort! Abort!

05:51.434 --> 05:56.355
(slow-motion voice):

05:51.434 --> 05:56.355
...me.

06:01.736 --> 06:02.696
Oh.

06:02.737 --> 06:04.363
Okay.

06:06.365 --> 06:08.243
At least I know.

06:12.455 --> 06:15.709
Give Gordo your fat.

06:17.627 --> 06:19.004
Hey, Mom,

06:19.046 --> 06:20.130
do you want the rest

06:19.046 --> 06:20.130
of my milk shake?

06:20.172 --> 06:21.215
It's really good.

06:21.256 --> 06:22.132
No, thanks. I'm fine.

06:22.174 --> 06:23.424
It's strawberry.

06:23.466 --> 06:24.676
I know that's

06:23.466 --> 06:24.676
your favorite.

06:24.718 --> 06:27.346
I'll take that.

06:30.057 --> 06:30.891
Hal, look!

06:30.932 --> 06:33.935
Boone Vincent

06:33.977 --> 06:35.020
is playing

06:33.977 --> 06:35.020
in Las Vegas.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.437
Who's Boone Vincent?

06:36.479 --> 06:38.148
Your mom's boyfriend.

06:38.190 --> 06:39.440
Stop it.

06:39.482 --> 06:40.859
You would not believe

06:40.901 --> 06:41.943
this jackass, boys.

06:41.985 --> 06:43.444
Women go crazy for him.

06:43.486 --> 06:45.446
He plays every instrument

06:43.486 --> 06:45.446
in the orchestra.

06:45.488 --> 06:46.823
He sings

06:45.488 --> 06:46.823
in four languages.

06:46.865 --> 06:49.159
And you like him

06:46.865 --> 06:49.159
just as much as I do!

06:49.201 --> 06:51.078
Oh, please,

06:49.201 --> 06:51.078
I just said that

06:51.119 --> 06:53.163
to get you into bed.

06:53.205 --> 06:56.250
That... when, that

06:53.205 --> 06:56.250
time you were so sick

06:56.291 --> 06:58.293
and you needed

06:56.291 --> 06:58.293
your rest.

06:58.335 --> 06:59.460
Hey, check it out!

06:59.502 --> 07:01.588
Only eight more

06:59.502 --> 07:01.588
miles to Vegas!

06:59.502 --> 07:01.588
Hey!

07:06.009 --> 07:08.970
Hal, look at this place.

07:09.012 --> 07:10.972
It's so classy.

07:13.350 --> 07:14.475
What's the matter?

07:14.517 --> 07:16.477
Never seen an 80-pound

07:14.517 --> 07:16.477
rabbit before?

07:16.519 --> 07:19.189
HAL:

07:16.519 --> 07:19.189
Uh-oh.

07:19.231 --> 07:20.315
Got a little spit-up.

07:20.357 --> 07:21.566
Here...

07:21.608 --> 07:23.902
Oh... honey, do you

07:21.608 --> 07:23.902
have a little, uh..

07:24.527 --> 07:25.779
Oh.

07:29.532 --> 07:32.493
Oh, my God! That's the one!

07:38.792 --> 07:40.335
(whistling Beethoven)

07:50.971 --> 07:52.806
Yes! I knew it!

07:53.932 --> 07:55.516
Oh, my God, Hal.

07:53.932 --> 07:55.516
You won the jackpot!

07:55.558 --> 07:56.476
I can't believe it!

07:57.978 --> 07:59.520
So, Malcolm?

07:59.562 --> 08:01.731
What do you and your science

07:59.562 --> 08:01.731
have to say now?

08:01.773 --> 08:03.608
We say you're having

08:01.773 --> 08:03.608
another dream, Dad.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.820

08:43.064 --> 08:45.066
I was going to fence it off

08:43.064 --> 08:45.066
last week.

Can you hear me now?

09:09.132 --> 09:11.385
My God, look

09:09.132 --> 09:11.385
at these puny rabbits.

09:11.426 --> 09:13.178
What do people do

09:11.426 --> 09:13.178
with them?

09:13.220 --> 09:14.179
I don't know.

09:14.221 --> 09:15.596
Maybe love them

09:14.221 --> 09:15.596
and hug them

09:15.638 --> 09:17.598
and watch them hop

09:15.638 --> 09:17.598
around the backyard,

09:17.640 --> 09:20.768
which they can do

09:17.640 --> 09:20.768
because their feet

09:17.640 --> 09:20.768
can touch the ground.

09:20.810 --> 09:24.314
I bet Gordo could fit

09:20.810 --> 09:24.314
that one in his mouth.

09:25.524 --> 09:27.317
Hey, Mom, I...

09:25.524 --> 09:27.317
Did you find

09:25.524 --> 09:27.317
your father?

09:27.359 --> 09:29.194
No. I-I wasn't...

09:27.359 --> 09:29.194
Well, it doesn't matter.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.612
I went through his wallet

09:29.236 --> 09:31.612
when we passed the state line.

09:31.654 --> 09:32.822
Let's see how much damage

09:31.654 --> 09:32.822
he can do

09:32.864 --> 09:34.491
with $20 and a library card.

09:34.533 --> 09:36.617
Okay, look, since you're

09:34.533 --> 09:36.617
obviously too caught up

09:36.659 --> 09:38.786
in playing the martyr here

09:36.659 --> 09:38.786
to even listen to an apology,

09:38.828 --> 09:40.497
you've forced me to

09:38.828 --> 09:40.497
go out and get these.

09:40.539 --> 09:42.499
They're for that stupid

09:40.539 --> 09:42.499
Boone Vincent guy.

09:42.541 --> 09:43.666
We're going together.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.710
Hey, that came out

09:43.708 --> 09:45.710
better than I thought.

09:45.752 --> 09:48.338
VIP seats?!

09:48.380 --> 09:50.507
Hi, my name is Dewey

09:48.380 --> 09:50.507
and this is my...

09:50.549 --> 09:51.632
Good Lord!

09:51.674 --> 09:54.135
What have you done

09:51.674 --> 09:54.135
to this poor animal?

09:54.177 --> 09:56.637
In all my years

09:54.177 --> 09:56.637
of judging rabbits,

09:56.679 --> 09:59.640
this is the uncutest thing

09:56.679 --> 09:59.640
I have ever seen.

09:59.682 --> 10:02.852
You should be ashamed

09:59.682 --> 10:02.852
of yourself.

10:02.894 --> 10:06.940
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

10:02.894 --> 10:06.940
Oh, my God! Oh, my...!

10:06.981 --> 10:08.649
OTTO:

10:06.981 --> 10:08.649
Help us!

10:08.691 --> 10:11.652
We have fallen down a well

10:08.691 --> 10:11.652
and we can't get out!

10:11.694 --> 10:13.447
If there is anyone up there

10:13.488 --> 10:15.656
who is just very shy,

10:13.488 --> 10:15.656
do not worry!

10:15.698 --> 10:17.075
We are not judgmental!

10:17.117 --> 10:20.161
As a matter of fact,

10:17.117 --> 10:20.161
when I was a little boy...

10:20.203 --> 10:21.704
Otto, please!

10:21.746 --> 10:23.540
No one can hear you.

10:23.582 --> 10:24.707
This is not productive.

10:24.749 --> 10:27.919
Can we just...

10:24.749 --> 10:27.919
Can we think for a second?

10:27.961 --> 10:30.213
(sighs)

10:31.923 --> 10:33.674
Don't you ever blink?

10:33.716 --> 10:37.137
Maybe I blink at the precise

10:33.716 --> 10:37.137
moment that you blink!

10:37.178 --> 10:40.098
That is ridiculous! How

10:37.178 --> 10:40.098
could you possibly know that?

10:40.140 --> 10:43.851
Why don't you spend

10:40.140 --> 10:43.851
less time worrying

10:40.140 --> 10:43.851
about my blinking

10:43.893 --> 10:45.937
and more time

10:43.893 --> 10:45.937
fencing up wells!

10:45.979 --> 10:48.689

10:45.979 --> 10:48.689

10:48.731 --> 10:52.693
Fine! If you are so unhappy

10:48.731 --> 10:52.693

10:52.735 --> 10:54.529
then I quit!

10:55.822 --> 10:58.699

11:13.214 --> 11:14.715

11:14.757 --> 11:16.759

11:16.801 --> 11:19.720

11:16.801 --> 11:19.720
were you there?

11:19.762 --> 11:22.765
I had floor seats when he had

11:19.762 --> 11:22.765
his first heart attack.

11:22.807 --> 11:23.975

11:24.017 --> 11:25.560

Oh, my Joey is here

11:25.602 --> 11:26.936
with me, too.

11:26.978 --> 11:28.438
Maybe the boys can sit together.

about all the trouble we caused.

15:28.511 --> 15:30.263
I know there's no way

15:28.511 --> 15:30.263
we can make up

15:30.304 --> 15:31.598
for the broken tables,

15:31.639 --> 15:35.226
or the paramedics,

15:31.639 --> 15:35.226
or the fire,

15:35.268 --> 15:39.063
or the guy that was really

15:35.268 --> 15:39.063
choking that nobody noticed.

15:40.481 --> 15:41.982
(panting)

15:42.024 --> 15:43.984
He touched

15:42.024 --> 15:43.984
my shoulder!

15:44.026 --> 15:45.194
(wailing)

15:46.529 --> 15:48.573
I can't believe

15:46.529 --> 15:48.573
this is actually happening!

15:48.615 --> 15:49.949
I can smell

15:48.615 --> 15:49.949
his cologne out here!

15:50.867 --> 15:53.119
Oh, my God, I'm next.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.455
Does my hair look okay?

15:55.496 --> 15:56.997
Compared to his?

15:57.039 --> 15:59.459
(laughing hysterically)

15:59.500 --> 16:02.044
Hello, sweetheart.

15:59.500 --> 16:02.044
Thank you for your support.

16:02.086 --> 16:03.797
It means

16:02.086 --> 16:03.797
so much to me.

16:03.838 --> 16:05.882
No, thank you

16:03.838 --> 16:05.882
for your music.

16:05.924 --> 16:08.468
Especially, um,

16:05.924 --> 16:08.468
"Cinnamon Rainbow."

16:08.509 --> 16:10.094
That is my

16:08.509 --> 16:10.094
all-time favorite.

16:10.136 --> 16:11.053
Really?

16:11.095 --> 16:13.097
Mine, too,

16:13.139 --> 16:14.474
but no one's ever

16:13.139 --> 16:14.474
told me that before.

16:14.515 --> 16:16.016
(squeals)

16:16.058 --> 16:17.977
Come in.

16:19.061 --> 16:20.939
(clicks tongue)

16:36.996 --> 16:39.332
I'm going in.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.332
I don't care what I see.

16:41.083 --> 16:43.962
Yes, I do.

16:41.083 --> 16:43.962
Who am I kidding?

16:44.796 --> 16:46.506
You mean he actually said

16:46.547 --> 16:49.133
he didn't want you

16:46.547 --> 16:49.133
at his awards ceremony?

16:49.175 --> 16:51.719
I can handle his being mad

16:49.175 --> 16:51.719
at me, but this was...

16:51.761 --> 16:54.138
Right to the old love pump.

16:54.180 --> 16:55.974
That's how

16:54.180 --> 16:55.974
I got to see your show.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.768
My son bought tickets

16:56.015 --> 16:58.768
to try to make it up to me.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.061
That's not an olive branch.

17:01.103 --> 17:02.856
That's the whole damn tree.

17:02.897 --> 17:04.315
Ah, it's like I say

17:04.357 --> 17:07.067
when I'm

17:04.357 --> 17:07.067
in the astronaut suit...

17:07.109 --> 17:10.571
"I believe the children

17:07.109 --> 17:10.571
are our future."

17:10.613 --> 17:13.032
I do, too.

17:13.783 --> 17:15.159
You can't really take

17:15.201 --> 17:18.120
what they say

17:15.201 --> 17:18.120
too seriously.

17:18.162 --> 17:20.247
They're teenagers.

17:20.289 --> 17:22.709
I'll let you in

17:20.289 --> 17:22.709
on a little secret, Lois...

17:29.173 --> 17:32.510
Even my 14-year-old

17:29.173 --> 17:32.510
is embarrassed by me.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.303
No.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.303
I know.

17:34.345 --> 17:36.096
Hard to believe, isn't it?

17:37.974 --> 17:41.352
But you can't hold

17:37.974 --> 17:41.352
onto the past, Lois.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.730
You've got to live

17:41.394 --> 17:43.730
in the here and now.

17:43.771 --> 17:45.147
Because

17:43.771 --> 17:45.147
the here and now

17:45.189 --> 17:49.402
is a special, special gift.

17:49.443 --> 17:52.196
That's why I call it...

17:52.238 --> 17:54.073
the present.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.785
(coyotes howling)

18:00.246 --> 18:02.122
Otto.

18:02.164 --> 18:07.127
Oh, are you still here?

18:02.164 --> 18:07.127
I thought you quit.

18:07.169 --> 18:09.380
You were right.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.049
This is my fault.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.508
For some reason,

18:12.550 --> 18:14.969
I've been sabotaging

18:12.550 --> 18:14.969
everything lately.

18:15.011 --> 18:16.512
Knowing that I've

18:15.011 --> 18:16.512
been here for a year,

18:16.554 --> 18:21.017
it's like people

18:16.554 --> 18:21.017
are depending on me now.

18:21.059 --> 18:23.519
And I know that at some point,

18:21.059 --> 18:23.519
I'm going to let them down.

18:23.561 --> 18:26.022
Don't be ridiculous.

18:27.231 --> 18:29.149
No one...

18:29.191 --> 18:31.444
expects you

18:29.191 --> 18:31.444
to be perfect.

18:31.485 --> 18:33.071
If I wanted

18:31.485 --> 18:33.071
perfection

18:33.112 --> 18:36.074
I would have hired

18:33.112 --> 18:36.074
a robot or a Swede,

18:36.115 --> 18:38.076
but I hired you, Francis,

18:38.117 --> 18:41.037
because you're smart,

18:38.117 --> 18:41.037
you're a hard worker,

18:41.079 --> 18:43.163
and when you make

18:41.079 --> 18:43.163
a mistake, you fix it.

18:43.205 --> 18:46.542
If falling down a well

18:43.205 --> 18:46.542
every once in a while

18:46.584 --> 18:50.421
is the price I must pay

18:46.584 --> 18:50.421
to have you, so be it.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.673
Thanks, Otto.

18:52.715 --> 18:54.801
GRETCHEN:

18:52.715 --> 18:54.801
There you are!

18:54.842 --> 18:56.427
Thank God!

18:56.469 --> 18:58.054
How did you find us?

18:58.096 --> 18:59.221
We just followed

18:58.096 --> 18:59.221
the fire.

18:59.263 --> 19:00.848
What fire?

19:00.890 --> 19:03.977
One of the cows got through

19:00.890 --> 19:03.977
the gate you didn't fix.

19:04.018 --> 19:05.185
And it knocked over

19:05.227 --> 19:06.687
one of the heat lamps

19:05.227 --> 19:06.687
you never took in.

19:06.729 --> 19:09.231
Which set fire to

19:06.729 --> 19:09.231
the trail of gasoline

19:09.273 --> 19:13.193
from the open can

19:09.273 --> 19:13.193
in the back of your truck.

19:13.235 --> 19:17.197
Which, by the way,

19:13.235 --> 19:17.197
also is on fire.

19:17.239 --> 19:19.199
Ah, you see, Francis?

19:19.241 --> 19:21.911
You thought you

19:19.241 --> 19:21.911
were a screwup.

19:21.953 --> 19:26.791
90,000 slot machines

19:21.953 --> 19:26.791
and not one of them right.

19:26.833 --> 19:29.836
I am never trusting

19:26.833 --> 19:29.836
a prophetic dream again.

19:29.877 --> 19:31.879
Thanks again, Malcolm.

19:31.921 --> 19:33.422
Don't tell your father,

19:33.464 --> 19:36.425
but meeting Boone Vincent

19:33.464 --> 19:36.425
actually made my knees...

19:36.467 --> 19:38.052
Aah! No-no-no-no-no-no...

19:42.140 --> 19:43.265
(gasps)

19:43.307 --> 19:45.935
Hal! What the...?

19:43.307 --> 19:45.935
I found you!

19:48.938 --> 19:50.773
(laughing)

19:54.694 --> 19:57.864
(playing Beethoven)

19:57.905 --> 19:59.406
It's all here!

19:59.448 --> 20:01.241
Would you like a free pull, sir?

20:01.283 --> 20:03.661
Yes, I would.

20:07.081 --> 20:08.708
Oh!

20:08.749 --> 20:09.917
(shrieks)

20:11.377 --> 20:13.963
(screams)

20:14.005 --> 20:15.173
I knew it!

20:15.214 --> 20:17.091
Hal, what is

20:15.214 --> 20:17.091
the matter?

20:17.133 --> 20:18.258
It's fate, Lois!

20:18.300 --> 20:19.677
I knew this would happen!

20:19.719 --> 20:21.095
I couldn't

20:19.719 --> 20:21.095
tell you because

20:21.137 --> 20:22.471
I knew you would be

20:21.137 --> 20:22.471
too closed-minded.

20:22.513 --> 20:24.264
I cashed in our life insurance

20:22.513 --> 20:24.264
for this,

20:24.306 --> 20:25.265
but it all paid off!

20:25.307 --> 20:27.434
We are rich!

20:27.476 --> 20:29.062
You did what?!

20:29.103 --> 20:30.270
Congratulations, sir.

20:30.312 --> 20:32.314
What's this?

20:32.356 --> 20:34.067
It's a coupon

20:32.356 --> 20:34.067
for a two-night stay

20:34.108 --> 20:35.985
at the Carson City

20:34.108 --> 20:35.985
Breezeway Motel.

20:36.027 --> 20:37.695
All you have

20:36.027 --> 20:37.695
to do is listen

20:37.737 --> 20:39.279
to a four-hour

20:37.737 --> 20:39.279
presentation

20:39.321 --> 20:41.032
about a wonderful

20:39.321 --> 20:41.032
time-share opportunity.

20:44.160 --> 20:48.664
Do they have slot machines

20:44.160 --> 20:48.664
in Carson City?

20:48.706 --> 20:49.790
Come on, Gordo.

20:49.832 --> 20:51.458
You have to eat

20:49.832 --> 20:51.458
the pellets.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.669
You can't have any

20:51.500 --> 20:53.669
fattening food anymore.

20:53.711 --> 20:54.670
Please, Gordo, you've got

20:54.712 --> 20:55.379
to try one...

20:55.421 --> 20:57.297
Ow!

20:57.339 --> 20:59.258
I cut my finger.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.344
He's eating.

21:02.386 --> 21:04.722
I think he likes

21:02.386 --> 21:04.722
your blood.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.728
(licking gently)

21:10.770 --> 21:14.314
Okay, if I black out,

21:10.770 --> 21:14.314
pull my finger out of his mouth.

21:15.524 --> 21:17.818
So, ten hours

21:15.524 --> 21:17.818
of stony silence?

21:17.860 --> 21:20.780
I may have some thoughts

21:17.860 --> 21:20.780
I feel like sharing.

21:20.821 --> 21:22.156
I'll let you know.

21:24.158 --> 21:26.493
Well, this trip

21:24.158 --> 21:26.493
wasn't a total loss.

21:26.535 --> 21:28.704
At least I...

21:28.746 --> 21:30.206
It was a total loss.

21:30.248 --> 21:31.749
The good news is,

21:30.248 --> 21:31.749
the survival mechanism

21:31.791 --> 21:33.333
in my brain is kicking in.

21:33.375 --> 21:34.543
I'm already starting

21:33.375 --> 21:34.543
to block out

21:34.585 --> 21:36.336
what happened this weekend.

21:36.378 --> 21:40.507
BOONE:

21:40.549 --> 21:43.343
