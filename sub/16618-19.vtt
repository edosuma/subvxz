she's acting very badly.

09:40.013 --> 09:42.080
For shame.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.249
Lisa, sweetie,
my professor money's

09:44.251 --> 09:46.084
going into your
college fund.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.719
Ooh, that's good,
I guess.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.387
How much is
in it now?

09:49.389 --> 09:51.423
Depends on what we do with
Grampa after he dies.

09:51.425 --> 09:52.857
Just burn me!

09:52.859 --> 09:54.726
Ooh, well, that's the
most expensive option

09:54.728 --> 09:56.261
I'm considering.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.430
BURNS:
Welcome to Burns University.

09:58.432 --> 10:00.098
Don't park at Del Taco.

10:01.702 --> 10:04.269
Our motto:<i> Ut uberiores divites.</i>

10:04.271 --> 10:07.472
Well, doesn't that mean
"The rich get richer"?

10:07.474 --> 10:09.240
Ooh, this
prestigious school

10:09.242 --> 10:11.076
doesn't need
Latin-translating troublemakers.

10:11.078 --> 10:12.677
You're expelled!

10:15.749 --> 10:17.082
(dog barking)

10:17.084 --> 10:18.650
When do I throw this in the air?

10:18.652 --> 10:20.752
You're a professor,
so you don't throw it.

10:20.754 --> 10:22.320
In fact,
you hardly ever wear it.

10:22.322 --> 10:24.055
Geez, I had this custom-made.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.657
Apartheid's over, Lenny.

10:25.659 --> 10:26.891
It worked!

10:26.893 --> 10:28.893
Mm-hmm.

10:28.895 --> 10:32.430
Man, copying is so hard.

10:32.432 --> 10:33.999
Any questions?

10:34.001 --> 10:35.166
Yes. What does it mean?

10:35.168 --> 10:37.402
Uh, what do<i> you</i> think it means?

10:37.404 --> 10:39.938
Remember,
there are no wrong answers.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.506
Well, I would guess that, uh,

10:41.508 --> 10:43.274
three neutrons coming out
when only one went in,

10:43.276 --> 10:46.144
uh, leads to some kind of
chain reaction.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.979
Wrong. There's always
a class clown.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.748
Ten-minute coffee break.

10:49.750 --> 10:53.485
Um, any of you homies want
to sell Schedule I narcotics

10:53.487 --> 10:54.919
to a fellow teenager?

10:54.921 --> 10:56.421
You're a teenager?

10:56.423 --> 10:58.323
What year were you born?

10:58.325 --> 11:01.259
Hey, you're not the cop
around here. I am!

11:01.261 --> 11:02.594
(groans)
What?

11:02.596 --> 11:04.429
Oh, right, my cover.

11:04.431 --> 11:05.664
Seriously, people.

11:05.666 --> 11:07.499
Some of us are here to learn.

11:07.501 --> 11:09.934
Professor, half-life of
radium, if you please.

11:09.936 --> 11:11.336
Don't look at book!

11:13.974 --> 11:16.508
Ugh. You're crushing me.

11:17.811 --> 11:19.144
What the hell is that?

11:19.146 --> 11:20.311
Guys. You know what?

11:20.313 --> 11:22.180
It's a beautiful day.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.182
Why don't we have class outside?

11:24.184 --> 11:27.952
Yes, that's it. Go on outside.

11:27.954 --> 11:30.121
I'm totally unqualified.
I don't even know

11:30.123 --> 11:31.890
how to get outside from here.

11:33.560 --> 11:34.959
That's the answer!

11:34.961 --> 11:36.327
Oh, wait.

11:36.329 --> 11:38.563
Hey, what's the matter,
Professor?

11:38.565 --> 11:40.065
He don't know
what to teach his class.

11:40.067 --> 11:42.233
Homer's just not cut
out to be a pedagogue.

11:42.235 --> 11:43.968
That's easy.
You just got to register.

11:43.970 --> 11:45.637
Stay away from playgrounds.

11:45.639 --> 11:47.472
Oh, you said "pedagogue."

11:47.474 --> 11:51.676
(sighs) So this is what
it's like to fail at something.

11:51.678 --> 11:53.411
LISA:
I can help you, Dad.

11:53.413 --> 11:56.815
Aw, if it isn't
Daddy's little wino.

11:56.817 --> 11:58.750
No, I'm clean.
One day clean.

11:58.752 --> 12:00.151
Yeah, I know that tune.

12:00.153 --> 12:01.519
Just come with me.

12:01.521 --> 12:03.521
You don't have time
to learn anything,

12:03.523 --> 12:05.824
but at least you can have
a sense of mission.

12:05.826 --> 12:07.358
I got these for you.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.894
<i> Dead Poets Society,</i>
<i> Stand and Deliver.</i>

12:09.896 --> 12:12.831
Each one a portrait of a great
teacher, told by Hollywood.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.866
Played by stars, each one paid

12:14.868 --> 12:17.402
more than a teacher makes
in a million lifetimes.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.938
I always cry at the end
of<i> Goodbye, Mr. Chips.</i>

12:19.940 --> 12:22.340
Mr. Chips is my name
for my Fritos.

12:22.342 --> 12:23.875
Just watch the movies.

12:23.877 --> 12:26.211
ROBIN WILLIAMS (over TV):
Words and ideas

12:26.213 --> 12:27.779
can change the world.

12:27.781 --> 12:29.114
Oh, look at the world!

12:29.116 --> 12:31.282
It just did a boom-boom
in its pants.

12:31.284 --> 12:32.984
You, you change it.

12:35.122 --> 12:37.622
Go to the woodshop
and make yourself a push broom.

12:37.624 --> 12:39.424
You're gonna need it.

12:41.128 --> 12:42.660
It's not a tumor.

12:44.464 --> 12:47.398
Oh, they were great.
They inspired me.

12:47.400 --> 12:48.600
And the best part
is where they show

12:48.602 --> 12:50.201
the real guy over the credits.

12:50.203 --> 12:52.203
He looks just like the actor
but fatter.

12:52.205 --> 12:53.571
(snoring)
(door slams)

12:53.573 --> 12:54.806
Okay, listen up.

12:54.808 --> 12:57.909
All it takes to be
a great teacher is to care.

12:57.911 --> 12:59.377
And I care.

12:59.379 --> 13:00.779
So I'm a great teacher.

13:00.781 --> 13:03.581
I don't like you,
and you don't like me,

13:03.583 --> 13:05.750
but I'm your only ticket
out of the barrio.

13:05.752 --> 13:07.085
<i>¿Comprende, ése?</i>

13:07.087 --> 13:08.787
I understand.
I understand plenty.

13:08.789 --> 13:10.622
Do you know you can
get a hot shower

13:10.624 --> 13:13.057
by hooking up your hose
to your car radiator?

13:13.059 --> 13:15.960
Towel off with the floor
mat and feel like a king.

13:15.962 --> 13:18.263
♪ Ah, cha-cha-cha,
cha-cha-cha. ♪

13:18.265 --> 13:23.234
Good. Now he can bring the rest
of the Latin Kings in line.

13:23.236 --> 13:24.636
Okay, first lesson.

13:24.638 --> 13:26.604
(whistle blows)

13:26.606 --> 13:28.606
(Lenny shouts)

13:28.608 --> 13:30.642
Always watch out
for a little rod

13:30.644 --> 13:32.911
falling into the back
of your shirt.

13:32.913 --> 13:34.445
I do it, like, every week.

13:34.447 --> 13:37.582
Now remember,
your chair has three levers:

13:37.584 --> 13:39.417
down, back and lock.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.286
Down, back and lock.

13:41.288 --> 13:43.855
Together.
ALL: Down, back and lock!

13:43.857 --> 13:46.024
Down, back and lock!

13:46.026 --> 13:48.092
Down, back and lock!

13:48.094 --> 13:49.928
Down, back and lock!

13:49.930 --> 13:51.429
Carpe diem!

13:51.431 --> 13:53.598
So, Andre, is it true?

13:53.600 --> 13:55.266
You're dropping out of my class?

13:55.268 --> 13:56.968
May I ask why?

13:56.970 --> 13:58.603
I... well, I...

13:58.605 --> 14:01.539
I-I want to go back to
counseling at-risk teens.

14:01.541 --> 14:04.442
No, Andre. You don't get
to throw your life away.

14:04.444 --> 14:06.811
I'll be here for every class.

14:06.813 --> 14:08.646
Carpe diem.

14:08.648 --> 14:10.014
Carpe diem.

14:10.016 --> 14:12.050
Just what does that
mean, by the way?

14:12.052 --> 14:14.018
Fish for a dime, my friend.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.987
Fish for a dime.

14:15.989 --> 14:17.388
(mechanical whirring)

14:17.390 --> 14:19.557
How much are we charging
for hugs, Smithers?

14:19.559 --> 14:21.292
Five dollars. But, uh,
I'll give you one for free.

14:21.294 --> 14:22.560
Quiet.

14:22.562 --> 14:25.163
Monty, I want to buy
the whole school.

14:25.165 --> 14:26.831
But it must include
Homer Simpson.

14:26.833 --> 14:28.566
He is a great teacher.

14:28.568 --> 14:31.502
But first I must find out how
much he's worth to the plant.

14:31.504 --> 14:33.037
(whispers indistinctly)

14:33.039 --> 14:36.474
I see. It seems I owe you
a hundred thousand dollars.

14:36.476 --> 14:38.343
Great lecture, Professor S.

14:38.345 --> 14:39.978
I finally understand
how gamma rays

14:39.980 --> 14:41.813
turned Bruce Banner
into the Hulk.

14:41.815 --> 14:46.050
Always remember the equation,
"gamma equals green."

14:46.052 --> 14:48.920
Man, I wish
you were my father, Dad.

14:48.922 --> 14:51.055
Uh, Simpson,
I've sold your contract.

14:51.057 --> 14:53.224
No! You cannot stop me
from teaching.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.927
I was going to paint houses
in the summer.

14:55.929 --> 14:57.996
Nothing will stop the greatest
teacher in the world

14:57.998 --> 14:59.564
from painting houses!

14:59.566 --> 15:01.900
Oh, calm down.
You'll be working for this man

15:01.902 --> 15:03.735
at his private estate.

15:03.737 --> 15:05.069
What? Me?

15:05.071 --> 15:06.571
Alone? Without my kids?

15:06.573 --> 15:07.739
Yes.

15:07.741 --> 15:09.574
Sounds good. Who are you?

15:09.576 --> 15:11.509
The owner of more
for-profit colleges

15:11.511 --> 15:12.911
than anyone in the world.

15:12.913 --> 15:15.246
But these students
are going to miss you.

15:17.717 --> 15:19.417
Thank you!

15:19.419 --> 15:21.185
I just want to say,

15:21.187 --> 15:25.590
each and every one of you
gets an incomplete!

15:25.592 --> 15:26.724
I can't hear him. Can you?

15:26.726 --> 15:27.926
Nope.

15:29.229 --> 15:31.262
Love was the test.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.464
And you all passed.

15:44.311 --> 15:45.743
(screeches)

15:45.745 --> 15:48.546
PILOT: Uh, folks, we'll be
landing at Mr. Verlander's

15:48.548 --> 15:50.615
secret estate shortly.

15:52.552 --> 15:55.553
A flight attendant
will be coming by to put

15:55.555 --> 15:56.754
a blindfold over your eyes.

15:56.756 --> 15:58.756
Cabin crew,
please wipe your memory

15:58.758 --> 16:00.825
and prepare for landing.

16:07.133 --> 16:10.101
Which way do I go?

16:10.103 --> 16:12.570
Uh, use the map!

16:13.773 --> 16:16.341
D'oh!

16:21.247 --> 16:23.915
Homer Simpson.

16:23.917 --> 16:25.616
AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE:
Voice does not match file

16:25.618 --> 16:26.985
from 1989.

16:26.987 --> 16:28.419
(Walter Matthau voice):
Let's go out

16:28.421 --> 16:30.822
for frosty chocolate milkshakes.

16:30.824 --> 16:34.592
Welcome, Homer Simpson.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.294
Whoa.

16:36.296 --> 16:38.129
Hmm.

16:38.131 --> 16:40.832
Hmm?
You unload your own dishwasher?

16:40.834 --> 16:43.267
Yeah. If you don't,
you get a, a funny smell.

16:43.269 --> 16:44.469
Now, come in.

16:44.471 --> 16:45.970
Are you tired from your trip?

16:45.972 --> 16:48.439
Let's get you a
refreshing cryofreeze.

16:48.441 --> 16:49.941
Rejuvenating, huh?

16:49.943 --> 16:51.609
It opens your pores.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.811
Uh, what happens
if I pee in this?

16:53.813 --> 16:55.113
Are you just asking?

16:55.115 --> 16:56.948
Or did you already pee in it?

16:56.950 --> 16:58.182
I'm asking for a friend.

16:58.184 --> 16:59.851
So what's our next activity?

16:59.853 --> 17:01.853
I hope it's not square dancing.

17:01.855 --> 17:03.554
I'd like you to meet
the rest of my guests.

17:03.556 --> 17:04.856
Hmm.

17:04.858 --> 17:07.992
Homer, say hello to the greatest
educators in the world.

17:07.994 --> 17:10.361
Neil deGrasse Tyson,
astrophysicist.

17:10.363 --> 17:14.532
The Solar System is over four
and a half billion years old.

17:14.534 --> 17:17.168
<i> Jeopardy!</i> champion
of champions, Ken Jennings.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.370
Who is "glad to meet you"?

17:19.372 --> 17:21.639
Financial educator Suze Orman.

17:21.641 --> 17:23.207
You are not allowed
to buy a Mercedes

17:23.209 --> 17:25.243
until you pay off
your credit cards.

17:25.245 --> 17:27.011
Great, now you tell me.

17:27.013 --> 17:29.247
Screenwriting guru Robert McKee.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.516
Welcome to the act three climax,

17:31.518 --> 17:35.386
resolution of story
and subplots.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.855
I expect you're wondering
why I've assembled a team

17:37.857 --> 17:39.690
of the world's
greatest teachers.

17:39.692 --> 17:41.492
To teach something.

17:41.494 --> 17:42.660
To somebody.

17:42.662 --> 17:45.063
Well, there are only six
basic plots.

17:45.065 --> 17:47.031
Rise-fall, fall-rise,

17:47.033 --> 17:49.000
steady fall, steady rise,

17:49.002 --> 17:52.370
black cop-white cop,
and stop that wedding.

17:52.372 --> 17:54.005
Well, here's what I'm up to.

17:54.007 --> 17:55.907
This is Sallie.

17:55.909 --> 17:58.109
And these are Sallie.

17:58.111 --> 17:59.911
And those are Sallie!

17:59.913 --> 18:01.546
And those...

18:01.548 --> 18:02.713
are Sullys.

18:02.715 --> 18:06.050
Robot replicas of
the greatest pilot of all time.

18:06.052 --> 18:07.618
He lost all their bags.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.220
No one talks about that.

18:09.222 --> 18:12.590
You are the greatest
living educators, of humans.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.559
But now you must face
the greatest challenge

18:14.561 --> 18:15.960
of your lives:

18:15.962 --> 18:19.564
Can you teach
an artificial intelligence?

18:19.566 --> 18:21.399
To teach a robot.

18:21.401 --> 18:24.135
Now you've compounded
<i>my</i> interest.

18:26.773 --> 18:29.107
That was a very useful time cut.

18:29.109 --> 18:31.442
Now, let's find out
what's going on.

18:31.444 --> 18:32.910
Leave that to me, Robert.

18:32.912 --> 18:34.412
What's going on?

18:34.414 --> 18:36.948
I'll tell you,
and I won't kill you afterwards.

18:39.586 --> 18:42.120
What? This is a student loan
application.

18:42.122 --> 18:43.921
Mm. Sallie...

18:43.923 --> 18:45.423
Sallie Mae?

18:45.425 --> 18:47.592
The Federal Student Loan
Program?

18:47.594 --> 18:50.394
You're creating an army
of robots so advanced

18:50.396 --> 18:52.430
that they can get student loans.

18:52.432 --> 18:55.733
That's right. These stu-bots--
or ro-dents, if you prefer--

18:55.735 --> 18:57.802
will attend the universities
I've been buying up

18:57.804 --> 19:01.339
and funnel billions
of taxpayer dollars to me.

19:01.341 --> 19:03.608
That's it. As Americans,
it's our duty to either

19:03.610 --> 19:07.879
stop evil billionaires or elect
them to the highest office.

19:09.582 --> 19:12.316
Well, we've done it. You're all
up to your polyurethane necks

19:12.318 --> 19:15.019
in debt and heading to Yale.

19:15.021 --> 19:16.654
Follow me.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.022
SALLIES:
Boola Boola.

19:18.024 --> 19:19.157
Boola Boola.

19:19.159 --> 19:20.525
Good luck, Homer.

19:20.527 --> 19:22.693
Will I see you at the last
minute saving the day?

19:22.695 --> 19:24.562
Nah, too clichéd.

19:28.968 --> 19:30.768
The Sallies
have blended right in.

19:30.770 --> 19:33.271
We've got 12 productions
of<i> The Crucible</i> going on,

19:33.273 --> 19:35.673
and the deepest Division III
women's lacrosse team

19:35.675 --> 19:37.308
the world has ever seen.

19:37.310 --> 19:39.377
(Homer murmuring)

19:40.380 --> 19:43.381
They're perfect students
in every way.

19:44.384 --> 19:47.618
And that's their weakness.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.691
Bleep, blop, bloop.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.059
Bleep, bloop, blorp.

19:55.061 --> 19:56.394
I am a robot, too.

19:56.396 --> 19:58.229
My father was a toaster.

19:58.231 --> 19:59.630
He's in botface.

19:59.632 --> 20:01.866
That's unbelievably offensive.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.134
Microaggression.

20:03.136 --> 20:04.902
Cultural appropriation.

20:04.904 --> 20:06.337
Offensive.
Offensive.

20:06.339 --> 20:08.039
ALL:
Offensive.

20:08.041 --> 20:11.542
Dear Lord, those teachers
made them too human.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.144
You've ruined me.

20:13.146 --> 20:14.345
Well, not completely.

20:14.347 --> 20:17.248
I still have my health.

20:17.250 --> 20:20.318
So, how much will it cost if my
daughter applies in ten years?

20:20.320 --> 20:21.519
$2,000.

20:21.521 --> 20:22.820
That's not so bad.

20:22.822 --> 20:25.156
That's the application fee.
Oh, yeah.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.263
Lisa, do you see them?
The rings of Saturn.

20:32.265 --> 20:33.431
I do.

20:33.433 --> 20:36.000
The question is,
what is five-sixths?

20:36.002 --> 20:37.235
Marge, listen to me.

20:37.237 --> 20:38.936
You can't fix stupid.

20:38.938 --> 20:41.205
You have to kill him
for the insurance.

20:41.207 --> 20:44.008
I've always said
these tags are pointless.

20:44.010 --> 20:46.577
Story's over. Good night.
