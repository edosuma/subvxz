00:29.174 --> 00:30.488
Jimmy..

00:31.382 --> 00:32.299
Over here..

00:33.217 --> 00:34.260
Jimmy.

00:35.109 --> 00:37.197
Over here..

00:37.209 --> 00:39.008
Flag the pole, Jimmy.
Go, go!

00:54.207 --> 00:55.573
I got it.

01:05.369 --> 01:08.271
This is Jimmy. I'm coming to the pits.
Ready for a fast one.

01:08.804 --> 01:10.205
Let's go, move, move.

01:11.488 --> 01:12.483
Lift there.

01:13.733 --> 01:15.683
Come on! You're going
to cost me the pole!

01:15.718 --> 01:16.767
Pick it up!

01:17.000 --> 01:18.235
Go.

01:24.919 --> 01:26.688
Go, go, go!

01:40.618 --> 01:42.668
Great. / Thank you.

01:48.446 --> 01:50.392
Damn it. / Something's wrong.

01:50.427 --> 01:52.876
Loosing power.

01:54.451 --> 01:57.137
What the hell did you guys do?
I can't believe this.

01:57.240 --> 01:59.695
Jimmy's dead-sticked.
Let's go get him, guys.

02:17.944 --> 02:19.580
Grand prix miami.

02:19.615 --> 02:21.182
What do we got?

02:21.217 --> 02:23.859
Chris petrie, 26 years old.

02:23.894 --> 02:27.608
Fuel man on american spirit pit crew.
Died during qualifying run.

02:27.643 --> 02:28.819
Okay.

02:28.854 --> 02:30.776
How is that unusual?

02:30.934 --> 02:33.226
Crew chief said it was a regular pit stop.

02:33.261 --> 02:36.026
by the book. / Okay,
so let's process the pit and the car.

02:36.061 --> 02:38.505
- What do you know about the driver?
- Jimmy hutton.

02:38.889 --> 02:40.284
He's missing in action.

02:40.319 --> 02:42.397
Blew the qualifying,
then blew out of here.

02:42.432 --> 02:44.357
No one seems to know where he is.

02:44.392 --> 02:46.282
Well, that's not by the book, is it?

02:48.955 --> 02:50.948
There was fire in the pit, Alexx.

02:50.983 --> 02:55.173
Burns extend into the
subcutaneous tissue. third degree.

02:55.302 --> 02:59.255
This boy got cooked. / And it also
means he burned for a while.

02:59.290 --> 03:03.209
Not surprising. Hot engine,
thousands of gallons of gasoline.

03:03.244 --> 03:05.419
What is more surprising is
they use methanol

03:05.454 --> 03:08.958
which is safer than gas
and has a higher flashpoint, doesn't it?

03:08.993 --> 03:12.177
Wasn't any safer for you,
was it, sweetheart?

03:12.323 --> 03:13.719
How did this happen?

03:13.754 --> 03:16.031
More importantly, why did this happen?

03:16.066 --> 03:18.308
Methanol can be put out with water.

03:18.961 --> 03:21.590
This water hose should have worked.

03:21.625 --> 03:24.741
- What time did you pronounce?
- Officially, we haven't.

03:25.225 --> 03:28.378
- You the paramedic?
- John leary, miami track doctor.

03:28.413 --> 03:31.139
Pronounce at the hospital.
I've got an ambulance standing by.

03:31.989 --> 03:35.314
- Doctor, this man's already dead.
- Still, he's going to the hospital.

03:35.349 --> 03:36.289
That's the way it's always been done.

03:36.324 --> 03:40.040
So you can say there's never
been a death at a track. Huh?

03:41.105 --> 03:43.801
- Bet that makes you look good.
- It's not about me.

03:43.836 --> 03:45.518
It should be about him.

03:49.874 --> 03:51.641
Is there a problem?

03:52.819 --> 03:56.820
Something seems to be
obstructing this water hose.

04:02.782 --> 04:04.052
Track's a dangerous place.

04:04.087 --> 04:05.645
Equipment breaks down,
people make mistakes.

04:05.680 --> 04:08.908
I think we will both agree, doctor,
that this doesn't belong here, does it?

04:08.943 --> 04:11.505
Like I said, accidents happen.

04:11.540 --> 04:12.946
That's quite true.

04:12.981 --> 04:14.596
But so,

04:14.631 --> 04:15.978
so does murder.

04:50.878 --> 04:54.011
MIAMI
2x07 Grand Prix

05:07.032 --> 05:08.516
How are we doing?

05:08.551 --> 05:10.305
Hundred ways to die in the pit.

05:10.340 --> 05:13.594
That's true, Eric, but only one
of them killed our guy.

05:13.629 --> 05:16.849
So, speed, the fire hose, please.
Take a look at it.

05:16.884 --> 05:18.011
Calleigh, the autopsy.

05:18.046 --> 05:19.801
I'll process the vic
and his clothing.

05:19.836 --> 05:21.204
Thank you. And Eric,

05:21.239 --> 05:24.350
the car and our missing driver.
Let's look into that.

05:24.385 --> 05:26.138
Okay, I'm on it.

05:29.122 --> 05:31.008
Excuse me. / Yes, ma'am?

05:31.100 --> 05:32.388
Are you in charge here?

05:32.423 --> 05:34.940
Well, I'm in charge of the investigation.

05:35.653 --> 05:37.819
You are? / Haley wilson.

05:37.854 --> 05:39.986
I own team american spirit.

05:41.250 --> 05:43.481
So, our victim is your employee.

05:43.516 --> 05:45.092
Chris, yes.

05:45.127 --> 05:47.094
He was like family to me.

05:48.586 --> 05:50.833
How soon do you think
you can clear this up?

05:50.868 --> 05:53.388
I need the pit for practice.

05:53.561 --> 05:55.837
You see, the problem
with the pit, ma'am,

05:55.872 --> 05:58.222
is that it's now a crime scene.

05:59.429 --> 06:03.324
Do you think we could talk
away from here? / Sure.

06:11.637 --> 06:13.968
Calleigh, when you're done
admiring the wax job,

06:14.003 --> 06:15.967
we've got a car to process.

06:16.627 --> 06:18.777
Just savoring the moment.

06:18.812 --> 06:20.892
Yeah, I know what you mean.

06:20.927 --> 06:23.304
These jam cars are the
most sophisticated vehicles

06:23.339 --> 06:25.878
you'll see besides the space shuttle.

06:26.320 --> 06:27.992
I didn't know you were a race fan.

06:28.027 --> 06:29.320
Oh, I'm not.

06:29.355 --> 06:34.177
I like a car just for itself, not for how
fast it goes compared to other cars.

06:34.388 --> 06:35.374
Are you kidding me?

06:35.409 --> 06:38.066
Racing is one of the
only pure sports left.

06:38.101 --> 06:40.213
The fastest guy around the track wins.

06:40.248 --> 06:42.271
No if, ands or buts.

06:42.306 --> 06:43.698
With the exception of Jimmy hutton.

06:43.733 --> 06:46.259
He hardly ever wins,
but he's very cute.

06:46.482 --> 06:48.333
He's also missing in action.

06:48.368 --> 06:49.823
Really?

06:49.954 --> 06:51.902
What I don't understand is,

06:51.937 --> 06:54.939
I mean, if the guy burns up in the pit
nobody's around to see it?

06:54.974 --> 06:56.779
It's the methanol.

06:56.814 --> 06:58.585
Yeah, it burns clear.

06:58.820 --> 07:01.117
It's invisible flame.

07:06.717 --> 07:09.208
Well, we have two parts
of the fire triangle.

07:09.243 --> 07:11.100
fuel and oxygen.

07:11.345 --> 07:13.393
So, that leaves the heat source.

07:13.428 --> 07:15.499
So, who do you think
provided the spark?

07:15.534 --> 07:17.898
Anyone in the pit crew.

07:17.933 --> 07:20.262
Got six guys, ten seconds.

07:21.852 --> 07:26.297
The jack man plugs in the air hose,
jacks a spark against the pavement.

07:27.990 --> 07:31.055
Got the tire changer,
he swaps the rubber,

07:31.333 --> 07:33.789
exposes the hot brake pad.

07:33.913 --> 07:37.105
Ann the fuel man, our victim,

07:37.332 --> 07:40.262
he locks in the fuel nozzle.
If he doesn't ground the line,

07:40.297 --> 07:42.753
it can cause a static discharge.

07:43.594 --> 07:45.790
A hundred ways to die in the pit.

07:46.241 --> 07:48.582
You see the logos on the drivers,

07:48.617 --> 07:50.580
the cars and the stands?

07:50.615 --> 07:52.509
The sponsors run this show.

07:52.544 --> 07:55.172
They decide who plays
and who sits on the sidelines.

07:55.207 --> 07:57.259
Mrs. Wilson... / Ms.

07:57.294 --> 07:59.552
I haven't had a top
five finish all season.

07:59.587 --> 08:02.531
I need a win tomorrow,
which means I need my pit now.

08:02.566 --> 08:03.427
I understand.

08:03.462 --> 08:06.660
I am looking to talk to
your driver Jimmy hutton.

08:07.929 --> 08:09.189
I don't know where he is. / All right.

08:09.224 --> 08:11.363
I find that hard to believe.

08:11.538 --> 08:13.155
He's not right. he's emotional.

08:13.190 --> 08:16.090
The last thing he needs is an
interrogation the day before a race.

08:16.125 --> 08:17.248
Yeah, I don't think you understand.

08:17.283 --> 08:20.459
There's not going to be a race if I
don't figure out what happened here.

08:21.769 --> 08:23.449
Look,

08:23.484 --> 08:27.034
my driver just blew a quarter
of a million dollar engine.

08:27.069 --> 08:28.306
I think we will both agree

08:28.341 --> 08:31.431
it's very difficult to do these with
the best engines in the world, right?

08:31.466 --> 08:34.284
Exactly, and it's even harder
to put a new one in by tomorrow,

08:34.320 --> 08:35.833
so, if I knew where he was, / Right.

08:35.869 --> 08:37.804
you'd hear me screaming
from there right now. / All right,

08:37.840 --> 08:38.984
here's the deal.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.874
Continue preparing for the race,

08:40.909 --> 08:45.388
but do not in any way prevent my team
from doing their job, understood?

08:45.648 --> 08:47.335
Done. / Good.

08:47.411 --> 08:49.157
Will I see you at the memorial?

08:49.192 --> 08:52.561
The what? / The memorial
for Chris, your fuel man.

08:53.320 --> 08:56.430
Chris, right.

08:56.540 --> 08:59.000
Yes, he's family, remember?

09:04.669 --> 09:07.186
Burns are confined
to the facial maxillary.

09:07.221 --> 09:10.129
Distal extremities of the arms.

09:10.164 --> 09:13.517
Hands went first.
Then he put them to his face

09:13.552 --> 09:16.836
- wicked up like a candle.
- A human torch.

09:16.871 --> 09:19.898
Thought those fire suits
were supposed to protect them.

09:19.933 --> 09:22.791
They are. Fire-resistant
material is guaranteed

09:22.826 --> 09:25.615
for 12 seconds
at 1,300 degrees fahrenheit.

09:25.650 --> 09:28.674
It's a triple redundancy, and I know
that he was wearing his safety gloves.

09:28.709 --> 09:31.410
Okay. Then how do you explain this?

09:31.445 --> 09:34.613
I'm seeing particulate matter
melted into the skin.

09:36.068 --> 09:38.063
Well, that shouldn't have happened.

09:38.098 --> 09:40.094
I mean the fabric carbonizes
when it's heated up,

09:40.129 --> 09:42.772
but the heat's supposed to stay
on the outside of the glove.

09:42.807 --> 09:45.693
Sounds like an accelerant was involved.

09:45.840 --> 09:48.089
It would have to be an accelerant
that would burn hot enough

09:48.124 --> 09:50.307
to go through fire-resistant material.

09:50.342 --> 09:53.987
- Got one in mind?
- I don't, but the mass spec might.

09:57.636 --> 10:02.469
Next up, seven qualifying laps
for tomorrow's race.

10:03.551 --> 10:05.294
It's like I told the detective.

10:05.329 --> 10:09.280
Pit stop went just like clockwork
in and out, nine point eight.

10:09.424 --> 10:13.199
I just, uh, I still can't believe
what happened to that kid.

10:13.354 --> 10:15.197
Hey, I'm the one who hired him

10:15.232 --> 10:18.064
six months ago, straight out of MIT.

10:18.526 --> 10:21.247
So, your fuel man was an engineer?

10:21.282 --> 10:22.404
You bet.

10:22.439 --> 10:25.409
most of these boys here
got advanced degrees.

10:26.167 --> 10:27.745
mechanical engineering,

10:27.780 --> 10:29.266
aerodynamics.

10:29.301 --> 10:32.562
You know, it's all about, uh,
it's all about squeezing.

10:32.597 --> 10:35.824
squeezing that extra bit of
performance out of the car.

10:35.897 --> 10:38.868
These guys don't look too broken up
about what happened this morning.

10:38.903 --> 10:41.857
Like, well, you don't train,
you lose your edge.

10:41.964 --> 10:45.531
I mean, a tenth of a second in the pit
costs you three places in the race.

10:46.129 --> 10:48.565
Anyhow, look, this is, uh...

10:48.849 --> 10:51.198
this is, this is Chris. I mean...

10:51.334 --> 10:53.324
it's what he wanted.

10:55.797 --> 10:58.126
It looks like he wasn't the only one.

10:58.232 --> 11:00.584
Win at all costs.

11:01.009 --> 11:02.776
It cost him his life.

11:03.011 --> 11:04.470
Look,

11:04.618 --> 11:06.932
that's not my idea.

11:07.067 --> 11:08.969
That's just the boss.

11:09.004 --> 11:10.837
I mean, she's, uh...

11:10.872 --> 11:12.717
you know, she's a hard-ass.

11:12.752 --> 11:15.425
She comes around here with those
speeches of, uh,

11:15.460 --> 11:17.509
teamwork, rah-rah-rah.

11:17.855 --> 11:20.077
But, uh, what I got to ask is

11:20.112 --> 11:22.597
where is she when a kid dies, you know?

11:22.632 --> 11:25.047
It sounds like you got a morale problem.

11:25.082 --> 11:28.263
No, what I got is a blown
engine and 24 hours

11:28.298 --> 11:31.444
to get the new one ready
for race day, so, uh,

11:31.479 --> 11:33.478
I'm out of here, all right?

11:33.513 --> 11:35.478
Joey?
Yeah, what do you need?

11:37.146 --> 11:38.846
I got your page.

11:38.881 --> 11:40.507
What's up?

11:40.737 --> 11:44.288
There's a 22-millimeter socket
missing from this.

11:44.426 --> 11:47.334
That's the same size as the one
H found in that fire hose.

11:47.369 --> 11:49.079
Whose toolbox is this?

11:49.114 --> 11:50.634
Chris petrie...

11:50.669 --> 11:52.119
our victim.

11:52.154 --> 11:55.301
Look, I'll print the workbench
and the toolbox.

11:55.336 --> 11:59.059
You'll probably get most of the
crew's prints off on those.

11:59.115 --> 12:02.655
Well, while you're at it, you might want
to figure out where that came from.

12:02.690 --> 12:05.022
Looks like a heel print.

12:05.174 --> 12:06.687
But supplemented.

12:06.722 --> 12:08.454
Nah, that's a racing boot.

12:08.489 --> 12:12.393
They have extra insulation in the heel
to keep the feet from burning up.

12:13.149 --> 12:15.159
We're looking at somebody
on the race team.

12:15.194 --> 12:18.705
No, not somebody. there's only one
person on any team that where's that shoe.

12:18.740 --> 12:21.108
It's the driver.

12:35.586 --> 12:37.077
Alexx...

12:37.112 --> 12:38.569
Not now.

12:40.281 --> 12:42.260
Jimmy hutton.

12:45.183 --> 12:49.116
You do realize that he's won the
least amount of races on the circuit.

12:49.262 --> 12:50.973
Didn't know.

12:51.008 --> 12:52.684
And don't care.

12:55.220 --> 12:57.554
Does your husband know about this?

12:57.589 --> 12:59.889
We have a look, don't touch rule.

13:00.052 --> 13:02.948
He's taller than I expected.

13:04.770 --> 13:06.872
Maybe guiltier, too. / What?

13:06.907 --> 13:10.356
Radio car just stopped him doing
120 heading out of state.

13:10.391 --> 13:13.068
Jimmy? / Yeah.
Oh, no, no, no. no.

13:13.103 --> 13:15.389
Not Jimmy. / Yes.

13:15.538 --> 13:17.485
So, Jimmy...

13:17.645 --> 13:20.328
a member of your pit crew dies

13:20.363 --> 13:22.966
and you go on a joyride.

13:23.001 --> 13:25.579
I went for a drive.
that's what I do.

13:25.906 --> 13:26.892
Look,

13:26.927 --> 13:29.733
I've been into the wall
180 miles an hour.

13:29.768 --> 13:31.964
I've broken more bones
in my body than I can count.

13:31.999 --> 13:34.396
But fire...

13:34.902 --> 13:37.435
it's worse than any crash.
It's bad luck.

13:37.470 --> 13:40.211
Seems like you've had
a lot of bad luck lately.

13:40.246 --> 13:42.238
Arrest for assault,

13:42.273 --> 13:44.674
drunk and disorderly
in half a dozen cities.

13:44.709 --> 13:49.949
Yes, and two weeks ago, you attacked
your fuel man Chris petrie, didn't you?

13:50.206 --> 13:52.312
- The guy was a loser.
- Well, now...

13:52.347 --> 13:55.912
- he's a dead loser.
- Better him than me.

13:56.141 --> 13:59.106
You know, he cost me three
tenths of second in Denver.

13:59.141 --> 14:02.036
That's a 150 grand of
my contingency money.

14:02.071 --> 14:04.511
Three-tenths of second.
You are a humanitarian.

14:04.546 --> 14:07.336
Look, I didn't want him dead,
just off the team.

14:07.371 --> 14:10.126
You got your wish.
I need your racing shoes.

14:10.161 --> 14:12.330
No way. / I have a warrant.

14:12.365 --> 14:15.117
Look, you wouldn't take Michael jordan's
lucky shorts the day before a game.

14:15.152 --> 14:17.042
I would if they were evidence.

14:17.077 --> 14:19.861
You can't do this.
I have race a tomorrow.

14:19.896 --> 14:21.009
Jimmy,

14:21.044 --> 14:23.714
there is a distinct possibility

14:23.749 --> 14:26.162
that you don't.

14:27.254 --> 14:29.395
I want the shoes.

14:32.942 --> 14:34.865
Car go in. / All right.

14:34.900 --> 14:38.175
Pilot, get everybody formed up.
This field is really spread out.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.546
10 miles please.

14:39.581 --> 14:41.378
Lead us 51.

15:14.120 --> 15:15.281
we got a problem.

15:15.316 --> 15:16.337
What's that?

15:16.372 --> 15:17.742
Jimmy's racing boot...

15:17.777 --> 15:20.066
doesn't match the print
we found inside the team's truck.

15:20.101 --> 15:21.480
Are you sure?

15:21.515 --> 15:24.820
Yeah. The print's a size nine.
Jimmy's a ten and a half.

15:25.076 --> 15:28.385
Somebody else was in front
of Chris petrie's locker.

15:28.420 --> 15:31.695
So we've got 20 teams, 20 drivers,
and now 19 suspects.

15:31.730 --> 15:32.860
Maybe not.

15:32.895 --> 15:34.940
I ran a trace on the print matrix.

15:34.975 --> 15:38.653
Hydrocarbons with detergent
additives. / Motor oil.

15:38.768 --> 15:41.224
20-50, super-high viscosity.

15:41.259 --> 15:43.960
I'll see if it leads us
to any brand names.

15:43.995 --> 15:45.023
So...

15:45.058 --> 15:47.280
what do we do about him?

15:47.762 --> 15:49.681
We cut him loose for now.

16:02.368 --> 16:05.387
Hey. How's it coming
with the samples?

16:05.574 --> 16:08.667
I've got everything our
human torch might've touched.

16:08.702 --> 16:10.157
Hose,

16:10.192 --> 16:12.735
rags, floor mats.

16:12.770 --> 16:14.871
I'm putting them in these paint cans.

16:14.906 --> 16:19.571
That's good. That will contain any vapors
until we process our mystery accelerant.

16:22.912 --> 16:25.806
Only one problem. I haven't been
able to get any control samples.

16:25.841 --> 16:27.169
Really? Did you check
with the other pits?

16:27.204 --> 16:29.125
'Cause I would think that
they would have clean samples.

16:29.160 --> 16:32.832
I've been asking all morning, but, uh,
no one's been jumping up to volunteer.

16:32.867 --> 16:36.307
Well, maybe you just haven't
been asking the right way.

16:38.300 --> 16:39.455
Excuse me.

16:39.490 --> 16:42.148
I was wondering if you all
could give me a hand.

16:42.283 --> 16:44.327
Anything you want.

16:44.362 --> 16:47.624
If you let me show you my car.

16:49.881 --> 16:51.920
I'd like that.

16:57.063 --> 16:59.354
Thanks again for letting us
use your equipment.

16:59.389 --> 17:02.428
Anything to help find out
who killed their fuel man.

17:02.665 --> 17:06.175
Tell me. Do they plan to race
tomorrow, team american spirit?

17:06.211 --> 17:09.336
I'm really not privy to
that kind of information.

17:09.492 --> 17:10.563
I see.

17:10.598 --> 17:13.092
It would narrow the field for
your team, though, wouldn't it?

17:13.127 --> 17:14.799
One less team.

17:15.548 --> 17:18.474
Your detective Salas already asked me
if I am part of this attack.

17:18.510 --> 17:20.489
if that's what you're thinking.

17:22.646 --> 17:25.375
I... I will have to take
you out sometime.

17:25.410 --> 17:27.759
Excuse me? / On the track,

17:27.794 --> 17:29.318
for a ride in my car.

17:29.353 --> 17:31.511
Oh, I didn't know that you could
do something like that.

17:31.546 --> 17:34.127
Isn't that against the rules? / Rules...

17:34.162 --> 17:35.728
rules are only good for running
at the back of the grid,

17:35.763 --> 17:38.255
just like our good friend Paolo here.

17:38.290 --> 17:41.813
Now if you ever want to ride
a real champion...

17:42.296 --> 17:43.829
I'm Ernest.

17:43.864 --> 17:46.511
Pay no attention to Ernest.
He.. he's always trying to pass me.

17:46.546 --> 17:48.930
Well, I do it every sunday
on the track. Why not now?

17:52.995 --> 17:55.131
I'm sorry about that.

17:55.166 --> 17:57.621
No, not that sorry.
I mean, it's a competition, right?

17:57.656 --> 17:59.094
It's okay if you break the rules.

17:59.129 --> 18:01.158
Rules can be bent without being broken.

18:01.193 --> 18:03.260
That's how you win races.

18:03.295 --> 18:05.388
That's interesting.

18:09.451 --> 18:12.018
Oil print from the boot.

18:13.831 --> 18:15.111
Pretty high-end stuff.

18:15.146 --> 18:17.877
Brand name is, uh,
Slick defense.

18:17.912 --> 18:20.091
- How many teams use this?
- Just one.

18:20.126 --> 18:21.273
Team Jeunet.

18:21.308 --> 18:25.496
- Hmm. Like the champagne.
- Okay. I want to talk to their drivers.

18:25.531 --> 18:28.324
- Okay, I'll have Yelina bring them in.
- No need.

18:28.359 --> 18:31.531
There will be a VIP party at the
mandarin-oriental this afternoon

18:31.566 --> 18:35.042
where they will be,
and so will I.

19:26.858 --> 19:28.977
I think you have an admirer.

19:29.012 --> 19:31.004
Duty calls.

19:32.302 --> 19:34.023
Lieutenant Caine.

19:34.058 --> 19:35.745
Still on the clock?

19:35.780 --> 19:37.372
Always.

19:37.407 --> 19:39.517
I hope you didn't come all
this way just to talk to me.

19:39.552 --> 19:41.833
Well, you're worth the drive.

19:41.868 --> 19:44.650
Can I get you a drink?
Some jeunet champagne.

19:44.685 --> 19:45.994
No, thank you.

19:46.029 --> 19:48.575
I know how you feel.
it gives me a headache.

19:48.610 --> 19:50.005
But they are the hosts.

19:50.040 --> 19:53.230
And from what I understand,
the largest sponsors in racing.

19:53.265 --> 19:55.539
So are you upgrading?

19:57.473 --> 20:01.548
I will take that as a yes. How does your
current sponsor feel about that?

20:01.583 --> 20:03.693
My sponsors?

20:03.748 --> 20:06.066
They're not savvy enough to know
that they're second-tier,

20:06.101 --> 20:08.166
let alone that I'm leaving.

20:08.201 --> 20:09.414
And you know, it's not a done deal,

20:09.449 --> 20:12.404
and it certainly won't be
if you keep coming around.

20:12.966 --> 20:14.740
Hayley.

20:17.201 --> 20:18.873
Who's your new friend?

20:19.118 --> 20:22.733
Charles jeunet, lieutenant
Horatio caine, miami crime lab.

20:22.768 --> 20:25.518
Hello, lieutenant.
Welcome to the house of jeunet.

20:25.553 --> 20:28.234
Charles, nice to meet
champ cars' biggest sponsor.

20:28.269 --> 20:32.433
- I hope you're not here on business.
- I'm actually here to talk to your drivers.

20:32.468 --> 20:34.666
Does this, uh, have
anything to do with

20:34.701 --> 20:36.830
the fuel man who died
on hayley's crew?

20:36.865 --> 20:41.064
Well, I told the lieutenant that it
was an accident covered by our policy.

20:41.099 --> 20:44.069
I even suggested that
he take the day off.

20:44.104 --> 20:47.278
I'm not sure how the victim's
family would appreciate that.

20:47.313 --> 20:49.099
You know what I mean?

20:51.128 --> 20:53.408
Your drivers?

20:53.443 --> 20:55.971
Just look for the most
beautiful women.

20:59.915 --> 21:01.675
Why do you need to see my shoes?

21:01.710 --> 21:04.170
It's just to exclude you
from the investigation.

21:04.205 --> 21:05.921
Or to include me.

21:05.956 --> 21:09.638
No, in all honesty, Paolo,
we're asking all of the drivers.

21:10.801 --> 21:14.026
Oh, my!
What size shoe do you wear?

21:14.234 --> 21:15.638
In your country...

21:15.673 --> 21:18.620
treze. I think size 13.

21:18.655 --> 21:22.237
Is that good? / Well, it's a far
cry from our suspect.

21:22.272 --> 21:23.278
Good.

21:23.313 --> 21:25.837
That means we can still
take that ride together.

21:25.872 --> 21:29.258
Oh, no. All joking aside, Paolo,
I can't socialize with you.

21:29.293 --> 21:30.831
I'm on a case.

21:30.866 --> 21:34.246
A case, it can't last forever.

21:36.874 --> 21:38.292
Ernest mansfield?

21:38.327 --> 21:41.587
- Yeah. Who's asking?
- Miami-dade police.

21:41.622 --> 21:43.947
You're too beautiful to be cop.

21:43.982 --> 21:46.900
Why don't you sit down
and let me get you drink?

21:47.214 --> 21:49.939
I got a better idea, Ernest. Why don't
you tell me what you were doing in the

21:49.974 --> 21:54.422
american spirit team truck
the day that Chris petrie died.

21:54.457 --> 21:55.958
I don't know what you're talking about.

21:55.993 --> 22:00.222
What size shoe do you take, my friend?
You look like you're about a nine.

22:00.946 --> 22:02.781
What are you?

22:02.816 --> 22:04.617
A shoe salesman?

22:04.690 --> 22:07.852
Shoo. You're boring me.

22:07.887 --> 22:12.048
So you're interested in
a little excitement.

22:12.860 --> 22:17.190
Okay, how about you're
under arrest?

22:19.954 --> 22:22.689
Excited?

22:25.970 --> 22:28.148
Sit him down, officer. / Sit!

22:28.733 --> 22:30.255
Thank you.

22:30.867 --> 22:32.721
I didn't do anything wrong.

22:33.495 --> 22:36.641
You sabotaged a fire extinguisher
in the american spirit pit.

22:36.676 --> 22:37.892
It killed the fuel man.

22:37.927 --> 22:38.800
What?

22:38.835 --> 22:40.711
You knew if you murdered him,

22:40.746 --> 22:42.641
you could damage the team.

22:42.676 --> 22:44.502
Fuel men are a dime a dozen.

22:44.537 --> 22:48.069
Glorified gas-pumpers.
Why on earth would I kill one?

22:48.104 --> 22:49.837
Well, here's a reason.

22:49.981 --> 22:52.812
This is yours and Jimmy's
first qualifying run.

22:56.097 --> 22:59.691
Jimmy hutton blew his engine
the day after you were in his truck.

22:59.726 --> 23:02.017
Did you sabotage it?

23:02.052 --> 23:04.697
Perhaps Chris petrie saw you do it.

23:04.732 --> 23:07.013
So you had to shut him up.

23:07.894 --> 23:09.830
Hey!

23:09.891 --> 23:11.213
What are you doing?

23:11.248 --> 23:12.705
Nothing.

23:12.740 --> 23:15.946
- Yeah, I'd like to see you prove any of that.
- If we find the engine, we might.

23:15.981 --> 23:17.777
Good luck.

23:17.919 --> 23:18.973
What does that mean?

23:19.008 --> 23:23.258
Engines get taken out
after every qualifying session.

23:23.293 --> 23:26.259
That engine's probably out
of the state by now.

23:26.294 --> 23:27.607
Well, if you're lucky,

23:27.642 --> 23:29.972
maybe you can buy it back for scrap.

23:30.128 --> 23:32.111
I feel lucky.

23:32.652 --> 23:37.529
Eric, let's stop all cargo trucks going
from the track to miami international.

23:37.564 --> 23:39.257
Thank you.

23:52.053 --> 23:53.922
This is Jimmy hutton's engine.

23:53.957 --> 23:55.791
The one that blew yesterday.

23:55.980 --> 24:00.299
Another half hour, it would've been on
the way to california for scrap and research.

24:00.334 --> 24:03.225
Now it's on its way to our lab.

24:09.174 --> 24:12.893
- Eric, you got the results?
- Yeah, right there.

24:17.208 --> 24:19.171
Wait a... wait a second.

24:20.683 --> 24:22.393
Are these correct? / Yeah.

24:22.428 --> 24:25.884
The engine was tampered with,
but it wasn't sabotaged.

24:26.154 --> 24:28.731
So somebody actually
made it perform better.

24:28.766 --> 24:30.937
These 4 cartwheels' engines
are legendary, H.

24:30.972 --> 24:33.074
But they'll blow, too,
if they rev too high.

24:33.109 --> 24:34.980
that's what the pop-off valve's
supposed to regulate. / Yeah,

24:35.015 --> 24:37.654
but somebody rigged
this valve, didn't they?

24:37.915 --> 24:40.096
- My money is on Jimmy.
- What about Ernest?

24:40.131 --> 24:42.545
- He snuck onto their truck.
- No... we stay with Jimmy.

24:42.580 --> 24:44.959
So that means we're back to
the same team we started with.

24:44.994 --> 24:46.480
Team american spirit.

24:46.515 --> 24:47.932
This doesn't make sense.

24:47.967 --> 24:51.648
Cheated to win the race,
killed their own fuel man?

24:51.683 --> 24:55.330
Eric, we have a team
that is at war with itself.

24:59.418 --> 25:02.078
Attention, all chief car team and driver!

25:02.113 --> 25:04.739
Up track for the final qualifying session.

25:18.507 --> 25:20.026
How did you get in here?

25:20.061 --> 25:23.202
I can be very persuasive
when I need to be, Ms. Wilson.

25:23.237 --> 25:25.477
Well, I'm not a fan of drop-ins, lieutenant.

25:25.512 --> 25:28.890
I can take you into custody instead
if that's what you'd like.

25:31.700 --> 25:34.134
Thanks for your discretion.

25:34.395 --> 25:36.640
but I still don't know anything
about the death of my fuel man.

25:36.675 --> 25:40.707
You don't know anything about sweetening
the engine to make the car go faster?

25:40.932 --> 25:45.022
No, I don't. / Ms. Wilson,
you team is at war with itself.

25:45.057 --> 25:46.738
Now, which side are you on?

25:46.773 --> 25:49.454
- The side that keeps us in business.
- You know what?

25:49.489 --> 25:51.555
That's not an answer.

25:52.862 --> 25:55.319
I got this team in my divorce.

25:55.354 --> 25:57.742
My husband got the state of utah.

25:57.777 --> 25:59.858
Now, I didn't even know
where a gas tank was in a car,

25:59.893 --> 26:02.196
and he thought it would be a joke.

26:02.231 --> 26:04.465
He was going to sit back and laugh.

26:04.500 --> 26:07.604
Well, he's not going to
laugh at me now, is he?

26:07.639 --> 26:09.388
You call me, babe?

26:11.176 --> 26:12.719
No, Jimmy.

26:12.754 --> 26:14.459
Well...

26:14.494 --> 26:16.164
I.. uh.

26:16.478 --> 26:20.305
look, we were just finishing
a conversation when you, uh...

26:26.302 --> 26:29.741
so I take it you're staying with the team
even with the change of sponsorship.

26:29.776 --> 26:32.411
Stay? I am the team.

26:32.607 --> 26:34.272
Jimmy...

26:34.395 --> 26:37.720
did you rig the engine to go faster
than cart rules allowed?

26:37.755 --> 26:38.973
No. / No.

26:39.008 --> 26:41.965
The engine blew on
its own, right, Jimmy?

26:42.000 --> 26:43.974
Hey, I'm the hottest driver
in the world, man.

26:44.009 --> 26:45.540
I don't cheat.

26:45.575 --> 26:47.073
You don't believe me,
check the engine.

26:47.108 --> 26:49.830
Sure you don't want to save me
the trouble, son?

26:49.967 --> 26:52.072
I don't break the rules...

26:52.107 --> 26:53.647
I bend them.

26:53.682 --> 26:55.373
Duly noted.

26:55.408 --> 26:57.064
and Jimmy...

26:58.919 --> 27:00.911
you missed a button.

27:19.789 --> 27:21.676
So, let me get this straight.

27:22.114 --> 27:24.073
Cart wants the cars to go fast,

27:24.108 --> 27:26.839
but not too fast. / Right. Speeds were
getting out of control,

27:26.874 --> 27:29.233
so cart installed the pop-off valve.

27:29.268 --> 27:30.605
A turbo cranks too high,

27:30.640 --> 27:33.773
the valve releases,
slows the car way down.

27:37.648 --> 27:39.617
I mean, how could anyone
mess with the valves?

27:39.652 --> 27:41.999
This place is guarded like fort knox.

27:42.034 --> 27:44.311
Only way is to do it before the race.

27:44.346 --> 27:47.614
Cart scrutineers hand out
pop-off valves... / what'd you say?

27:47.649 --> 27:49.024
Scrutineers.

27:49.059 --> 27:52.901
That's what cart calls
their tech inspectors.

27:53.132 --> 27:54.738
Well, they might. you shouldn't.

27:54.773 --> 27:56.657
The tech inspectors...

27:56.692 --> 28:00.159
they hand out the pop-off valves to the
drivers the night before the race.

28:00.194 --> 28:03.103
Collect them right after
the checkered flag.

28:11.191 --> 28:13.750
So Jimmy only had a few hours
to doctor the valve.

28:13.785 --> 28:16.310
The engine heat would've
burned off most contact,

28:16.345 --> 28:18.135
so no fingerprints.

28:18.170 --> 28:20.277
That doesn't mean no evidence.

29:51.386 --> 29:52.756
Hey, what's up?

29:52.791 --> 29:56.214
Pop-off valve had petroleum
deposits, carbon residue,

29:56.249 --> 29:57.791
and check that out.

29:57.826 --> 29:59.383
superglue.

30:01.724 --> 30:05.233
Well, you put superglue in your valve
before the race, going to lock up.

30:05.268 --> 30:08.299
Yeah. Explains why Jimmy's
valve didn't pop off.

30:10.903 --> 30:12.768
That's why engine blew.

30:13.502 --> 30:14.437
Gets better.

30:14.472 --> 30:17.109
Over the course of the race,
the engine heat

30:17.144 --> 30:19.633
melts most of the superglue away.

30:22.001 --> 30:24.844
And that's why Jimmy's passed
inspection with flying colors.

30:24.879 --> 30:28.631
Yeah, I'm going to let Horatio know
that our little golden boy isn't so golden.

30:30.586 --> 30:33.488
I'm sick of people thinking
I'm just some pretty face.

30:33.595 --> 30:36.061
So you rigged the valve.

30:37.369 --> 30:40.613
All the attention from the fans,
the sponsors. I just...

30:40.648 --> 30:43.204
wanted to earn it...
just once.

30:43.332 --> 30:45.412
Does Hayley know about this?

30:45.447 --> 30:48.939
Hayley and I don't exactly do
a lot of talking when we're together,

30:49.070 --> 30:50.923
- You know what I mean.
- I can guess.

30:50.958 --> 30:52.741
Here's what we're going to do, Jimmy.

30:52.776 --> 30:55.766
We're going to keep this little
conversation between you and I.

30:55.801 --> 30:57.683
You're not going to tell
her I'm cheating?

30:58.084 --> 31:00.210
Not yet.
I'll let you know.

31:03.002 --> 31:03.977
Speed,

31:04.012 --> 31:05.649
fuel man's gloves?

31:05.684 --> 31:08.429
The only accelerant was methanol,
but, uh,

31:08.464 --> 31:11.138
I did find trace
of potassium chlorate.

31:11.173 --> 31:13.777
- Okay, sporadic or uniform?
- Uniform.

31:13.812 --> 31:16.058
It was like the gloves
were treated with the stuff.

31:16.093 --> 31:18.264
Maybe they had been.

31:21.425 --> 31:22.762
We'll follow it.

31:22.797 --> 31:24.100
Find me, Speed.

31:25.701 --> 31:28.447
Okay, so the gloves were treated.

31:28.482 --> 31:31.193
The question is how'd they'd ignite?

31:33.079 --> 31:36.278
Did you see this discoloration
on the fuel handle?

31:36.435 --> 31:37.598
Yeah, we already saw that.

31:37.633 --> 31:40.635
It's consistent with a burn
from an open flame.

31:40.670 --> 31:42.527
But what about the powder
on the nozzle?

31:42.562 --> 31:45.816
I mean, couldn't that be consistent
with a burn from sulfuric acid?

31:45.851 --> 31:50.550
Yeah, but it still doesn't tell us
how you start a fire without a match.

31:50.718 --> 31:54.254
unless you're thinking
exothermic reaction.

31:54.289 --> 31:59.218
Well, the acid from the nozzle meets the
potassium chlorate on the gloves, you get fire.

31:59.253 --> 32:03.095
Which means Chris petrie
turned into his own fuse.

32:31.418 --> 32:32.634
Nasty burn.

32:32.669 --> 32:34.607
Yeah, I was, uh, working on the truck,

32:34.642 --> 32:36.545
- spilled battery acid.
- Battery acid?

32:36.580 --> 32:38.755
I don't think so.

32:39.006 --> 32:43.209
I think that's from coating fuel
nozzle that killed Chris petrie.

32:43.244 --> 32:44.276
that's what I think.

32:44.311 --> 32:48.040
Look, working with dangerous
chemicals, that's part of my job.

32:48.192 --> 32:52.074
I mean, hell, the asbestos in..
in my glove liners could give you cancer,

32:52.109 --> 32:55.956
but that's all right, I'm old school.
I really don't care what OSHA says...

32:55.991 --> 32:57.216
and besides, uh,

32:57.251 --> 32:58.955
half the stuff in the pit'll
kill you. / Yes,

32:58.990 --> 33:02.247
but one of them shouldn't be
your crew chief, should it?

33:02.674 --> 33:05.078
Are you accusing me of murder?

33:05.113 --> 33:07.482
With my reputation, murder?

33:07.889 --> 33:10.202
I'll tell you what.
You get your state's attorney,

33:10.237 --> 33:12.520
you bring him down here,
and you arrest me.

33:12.636 --> 33:14.924
In due time, Ron.

33:15.044 --> 33:16.916
In due time.

33:31.198 --> 33:33.157
So, did the chief douse the fuel nozzle?

33:33.192 --> 33:34.180
We don't know yet.

33:34.215 --> 33:37.487
We got less than 24 hours before the race
and the whole circus moves to mexico city.

33:37.522 --> 33:39.965
Mexico. That's going to make
extradition near impossible.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.940
Ron elner could get away with this.

33:41.975 --> 33:44.031
Crew's not cooperating.
We're out of witnesses.

33:44.066 --> 33:46.479
Okay, if the crew doesn't help us,

33:46.514 --> 33:48.293
the cars will.

33:48.426 --> 33:50.855
Here is the last surveillance
tape of the pit stop.

33:50.890 --> 33:54.018
If the crew chief used sulfuric acid,
we didn't get it on tape.

33:54.053 --> 33:55.682
Nothing that proves murder.

33:55.717 --> 33:57.932
The worst we can say is that
he's a bad mechanic.

33:57.967 --> 33:59.154
How do you figure?

33:59.189 --> 34:00.507
Look.

34:01.535 --> 34:03.658
Ernest passed Jimmy right
after the pit stop,

34:03.693 --> 34:06.004
and that should never happen.

34:06.203 --> 34:08.223
Pull up Jimmy's lap times.

34:11.024 --> 34:12.838
Jimmy's car got slower.

34:12.873 --> 34:14.754
It lost speed after the pit stop.

34:14.789 --> 34:16.601
The car doesn't look any different.

34:16.636 --> 34:18.976
Little adjustments make a big difference.

34:19.011 --> 34:20.598
What's he doing there?

34:22.498 --> 34:24.489
Crew chief is raising the wing.

34:24.525 --> 34:26.599
I thought a high front
wing was good thing.

34:26.634 --> 34:30.967
That's a point, but if you tilt it too high,
it actually slows the car down.

34:31.002 --> 34:33.666
Here's the wing before the pit stop.

34:33.918 --> 34:35.478
and here it is after.

34:35.514 --> 34:37.005
See the difference?

34:37.041 --> 34:39.190
So he was trying to lose?

34:39.226 --> 34:42.656
Fluid dynamic sensors
may tell us the whole story.

34:44.382 --> 34:46.724
Look at the disturbance
around the front wing.

34:51.329 --> 34:53.833
Jimmy tried to overcompensate
for the loss of speed.

34:53.868 --> 34:55.047
That's what blew the engine.

34:55.083 --> 34:58.096
Yes, and our crew chief was
working against his own driver.

34:58.131 --> 35:01.074
I checked every inch of that car,
and that wing looked fine.

35:01.109 --> 35:06.432
Right, / but that's because by the time you got
there, you were looking at a different wing.

35:06.849 --> 35:11.586
Wings lift things off the ground.
It's an interesting name for a car part.

35:12.099 --> 35:14.616
You know, these wings are
mounted upside down.

35:14.651 --> 35:16.895
Make the car stick to the ground.

35:16.930 --> 35:18.825
Downforce.

35:19.009 --> 35:22.194
These cars hit 140,
they could stick to the ceiling.

35:29.876 --> 35:31.896
That thing cost more than your car.

35:31.931 --> 35:33.882
It's on the trash heap after five laps.

35:33.917 --> 35:36.808
Well, these teams spend
millions a year on R&D.

35:36.843 --> 35:39.814
Most of these parts won't last the race.

35:42.469 --> 35:45.059
Like this one.

35:45.122 --> 35:46.912
- Here's Jimmy's wing.
- Okay, even if that's Jimmy's wing,

35:46.947 --> 35:49.723
how do we know it's the one
the chief messed with?

35:50.818 --> 35:53.862
Because he left a piece of
himself behind, right here.

36:04.786 --> 36:08.601
Ron, we managed to lift a glove print

36:08.770 --> 36:11.516
off the wing that you loosened.

36:11.671 --> 36:13.580
Come on. Anybody could
have adjusted that.

36:13.615 --> 36:17.337
Yes, but not everybody has
asbestos-lined gloves, do they?

36:23.699 --> 36:26.601
But then again, you're old school.

36:26.636 --> 36:31.019
Chris petrie caught you loosening
the wing that night, didn't he?

36:38.646 --> 36:40.961
He was going to report you.

36:41.369 --> 36:44.049
Then your career
would have been over.

36:44.084 --> 36:46.760
So it was time for him to go.

36:46.795 --> 36:49.437
So, you treated his gloves.

36:53.934 --> 36:58.208
then doused a little
sulfuric acid on qualifying day.

37:01.975 --> 37:04.487
Then once the fire started,

37:04.522 --> 37:07.000
you made sure it wouldn't stop.

37:09.571 --> 37:12.958
So you sabotaged water hose.

37:15.279 --> 37:19.127
I have just one question for you, Ron.

37:20.517 --> 37:22.917
Why would an old school,

37:22.952 --> 37:26.701
competitive guy like you
choose to lose? Why?

37:27.983 --> 37:30.315
I can't say.

37:52.920 --> 37:55.716
You've just missed
all the excitement.

37:55.873 --> 37:57.368
We signed the papers.

37:57.403 --> 38:02.726
Jeunet champagne is going to become
the exclusive sponsor of american spirit.

38:02.761 --> 38:04.895
So your plan...

38:05.054 --> 38:07.527
your plan worked out.

38:07.653 --> 38:09.352
What do you mean?

38:09.387 --> 38:11.052
Losing to win.

38:11.612 --> 38:13.706
That's only the half of it.

38:13.741 --> 38:18.252
I had to act like I wanted
to win as I was losing.

38:18.393 --> 38:21.212
So the plan was to get dumped

38:21.247 --> 38:24.201
by your low-rent sponsor
and picked up,

38:24.236 --> 38:27.156
straight into bed with the big boys,

38:27.191 --> 38:30.277
jeunet champagne and Ron,

38:30.312 --> 38:35.177
he had to make sure
that Jimmy couldn't win.

38:35.212 --> 38:37.605
That was the plan.

38:37.720 --> 38:39.563
Ron broke the law, not me.

38:39.598 --> 38:43.551
That's true, but you stood by
while an honest man lost his life

38:43.586 --> 38:47.167
and probably the only
honest man on your team.

38:48.990 --> 38:50.548
Lieutenant.

38:50.583 --> 38:53.297
Yes, congratulations
are in order, I understand.

38:53.332 --> 38:54.487
Thank you.

38:54.522 --> 38:56.233
And while I'm on the subject,

38:56.268 --> 38:59.308
good luck, Charles,
finding a new crew chief.

38:59.343 --> 39:00.558
Excuse me?

39:00.593 --> 39:05.491
This afternoon we picked up Ron elner
for the murder of Chris petrie.

39:07.035 --> 39:09.561
Charles, I thought you knew.

39:09.674 --> 39:13.378
Charles, the team had
nothing to do with this.

39:15.165 --> 39:17.841
We have an agreement in place.

39:17.876 --> 39:19.750
I know.

39:19.785 --> 39:22.851
I'm sure this is just
a bump in the road.

39:23.425 --> 39:26.672
But, uh, I'll have to speak
to my attorneys.

39:27.720 --> 39:30.111
Well... Charlie,

39:30.146 --> 39:31.715
no deal,

39:31.750 --> 39:33.353
no driver.

39:33.388 --> 39:34.921
Mr. Hutton,

39:34.956 --> 39:38.321
it's hard to race without
a crew chief or a fuel man.

39:38.356 --> 39:40.536
My team is still available to you.

39:40.571 --> 39:42.761
What about Ernest?

39:42.905 --> 39:44.876
I'd bump him.

39:44.911 --> 39:47.316
That's your choice.

39:49.743 --> 39:51.239
Peace out.

39:51.274 --> 39:54.205
Jimmy. / Sorry.

39:54.472 --> 39:56.223
I made you.

39:56.258 --> 39:58.517
Then be proud of me, Hayley.

40:04.486 --> 40:06.510
Vroom, vroom.

40:46.655 --> 40:53.472
- Ernest, Ernest, right here.
- Come one, shall we?

41:00.986 --> 41:05.064
Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy, please!
Right here.

41:22.082 --> 41:24.719
Breeze, breeze, breeze, start race.

41:33.736 --> 41:35.653
I'll be back on top.

41:35.688 --> 41:37.535
I have no doubt.

41:37.570 --> 41:41.258
You want to watch the race with me?
I can still get into the VIP room.

41:41.625 --> 41:45.320
Well, I appreciate the offer,
but I actually have other plans.

41:46.123 --> 41:48.226
A woman?

41:50.362 --> 41:52.651
A funeral?

41:56.297 --> 41:58.800
You want to come?

42:05.926 --> 42:08.680
Take care, Hayley.
