probably illegal-in-most
countries way.

18:46.416 --> 18:48.669
And...and what's up
with stealing my phone?

18:48.752 --> 18:49.878
- In my defense, you probably
should have picked

18:49.962 --> 18:53.507
a better password
than "The Troy."

18:53.590 --> 18:58.178

Why is she even here?

18:58.262 --> 19:00.097
This is my big chance
to get into Wentworth,

19:00.180 --> 19:01.723
but I'm so angry,
I don't even know

19:01.807 --> 19:03.559
if I can focus on playing.

19:03.642 --> 19:06.687
- Unless you focus
your anger on playing.

19:06.770 --> 19:08.522
- Or, better idea,

19:08.605 --> 19:11.608
I can use my mad feelings
to help me play better.

19:11.692 --> 19:13.819
- Or that.
- Okay.

19:13.902 --> 19:16.405
I'm about to kick some butt

broke up with you?

the scout from

- I've gotta admit
I'm impressed.

20:21.887 --> 20:24.640
It's been a long time since I've
seen a talent like yours--

20:24.723 --> 20:27.267
especially one with such
an unfailing grip.

20:27.351 --> 20:29.353
- Wow, thank you, sir!

20:29.436 --> 20:32.940
- I meant your handshake, son.
You can let go now.

- Sorry.

20:34.524 --> 20:36.610

that, if you want it,

20:36.693 --> 20:37.986
there'll be a spot for you at
Wentworth Academy next year.

20:40.405 --> 20:42.866

20:42.950 --> 20:44.451
This is such a great
opportunity.

20:44.534 --> 20:45.869
I mean, there are
so many good reasons

20:45.953 --> 20:49.456
to go to your school, but...

20:49.539 --> 20:52.084
there's a lot of good reasons
to stay here, too.

20:52.167 --> 20:53.752
I'm gonna have to
think about it.

20:53.835 --> 20:55.671
Thank you.

20:55.754 --> 20:58.006
- I understand, son.

20:58.090 --> 21:00.801
We'll need a decision before
the end of the school year.

21:00.884 --> 21:03.303
- Okay. Thank you.

21:04.262 --> 21:08.392

texting disasters,

21:23.240 --> 21:24.950
maybe we should all communicate

way for a while.

- In poem?
- In person.

21:30.038 --> 21:31.665
- Much better idea.

21:31.748 --> 21:33.375
- All right, texting time out.
Everyone stack your phones.

21:33.458 --> 21:36.253
First person to check their
texts pays for pizza.

21:36.336 --> 21:38.547
