02:18.583 --> 02:20.717
Hey kid, do you
mind changing that?

02:20.719 --> 02:22.385
Having to live through
it was bad enough.

02:22.387 --> 02:24.590
I don't need to see it again.

02:31.363 --> 02:32.629
Better?

02:33.599 --> 02:34.868
Much. Thanks.

02:40.539 --> 02:41.705
Come on.

02:41.707 --> 02:44.008
How could you miss such
a clear open chance? Idiot.

02:44.010 --> 02:45.709
What's the score?

02:45.711 --> 02:47.578
1-0.

02:47.580 --> 02:48.945
Partizani's ahead.

02:48.947 --> 02:50.580
And how much time's left?

02:50.582 --> 02:53.352
Plenty.
They just started.

02:54.719 --> 02:55.652
Good.

02:55.654 --> 02:57.554
I fucking hate Skenderbeu.

02:57.556 --> 03:00.493
Yeah, but they have a
better team this season.

03:01.459 --> 03:02.592
You know they spend
all this damn money

03:02.594 --> 03:03.894
for those foreigners,

03:03.896 --> 03:05.732
and they still fucking lose.

03:19.712 --> 03:20.644
Those movies are badass.

03:20.646 --> 03:22.079
And that one guy with the beard

03:22.081 --> 03:22.879
I don't know who he is, but...

03:22.881 --> 03:24.080
I don't know man.

03:24.082 --> 03:25.515
Those American
movies always make

03:25.517 --> 03:26.984
Albanians look like
a bunch of criminals.

03:26.986 --> 03:28.718
It's total bullshit.

03:28.720 --> 03:29.652
Not true.

03:29.654 --> 03:30.888
It is true.

03:30.890 --> 03:32.522
No, not
all of them do.

03:33.458 --> 03:34.624
Yeah, okay. Give me one movie,

03:34.626 --> 03:35.558
just one movie
where we do not play

03:35.560 --> 03:36.730
these like cliche scumbags.

03:37.730 --> 03:39.096
We have a beautiful country.

03:39.098 --> 03:40.497
I'm tired of us being exploited.

03:40.499 --> 03:41.632
We're not all crooks.

03:41.634 --> 03:44.435
You know we are
criminals, right?

03:44.437 --> 03:45.635
Shit.

03:45.637 --> 03:47.039
I mean, we've gotta make
a living too, right?

03:50.709 --> 03:51.711
Take it easy.

04:00.753 --> 04:01.588
Evening, boys.

04:04.356 --> 04:05.357
Evening, princess.

04:10.129 --> 04:12.396
So, shall we get down
to business, brother?

04:12.398 --> 04:14.397
Yes, but first things first.

04:14.399 --> 04:15.034
The bag?

04:18.536 --> 04:19.672
As an act of good faith

04:21.639 --> 04:23.075
just to ease the tension, guys.

04:26.812 --> 04:28.778
Look, we brought the
deposit like you asked.

04:28.780 --> 04:30.713
Tell us when and where
for the shipping, okay?

04:30.715 --> 04:31.781
Take it easy, brother.

04:31.783 --> 04:32.785
We're just finishing up.

04:33.886 --> 04:34.785
And what are you playing?

04:34.787 --> 04:36.754
Briscola Bastarda.

04:36.756 --> 04:37.987
It's Italian.

04:37.989 --> 04:40.591
I pick it up when I
was living in Naples.

04:40.593 --> 04:41.591
Now he's addicted.

04:41.593 --> 04:44.694
This guy doesn't want
to play anything else.

04:44.696 --> 04:45.798
So, how do you play?

04:48.800 --> 04:49.635
Have we met?

04:50.936 --> 04:52.435
No.

04:52.437 --> 04:54.538
I'm sure I'd remember if we had.

04:54.540 --> 04:56.773
So, how do you play?

04:56.775 --> 05:00.679
This game is all about
deception and misdirection.

05:01.747 --> 05:04.982
A trump card is decided at
the beginning of the game.

05:04.984 --> 05:06.083
Briscola

05:06.085 --> 05:07.918
is the trump card.

05:07.920 --> 05:10.788
You can play alone
or with a partner.

05:10.790 --> 05:12.559
The objective remains the same.

05:13.725 --> 05:15.694
Whoever gets to 15
points first, wins.

05:17.062 --> 05:18.728
Having a guy walk along with you

05:18.730 --> 05:21.064
is a good way to throw
the other players off.

05:21.066 --> 05:22.733
Unless your opponent
sees through you.

05:22.735 --> 05:24.634
Yes, but it only
happens if you don't know

05:24.636 --> 05:25.537
what you're doing.

05:27.071 --> 05:28.507
You guys look thirsty.

05:30.775 --> 05:32.576
Vodka?

05:32.578 --> 05:33.810
Be careful.

05:33.812 --> 05:35.812
Briscola Bastarda
with five people

05:35.814 --> 05:36.879
is a completely different game.

05:36.881 --> 05:39.081
I'm confused.

05:39.083 --> 05:39.886
Yes.

05:40.852 --> 05:42.752
It's a confusing game.

05:42.754 --> 05:43.821
Still sounds fun.

05:43.823 --> 05:45.021
Can we play?

05:45.023 --> 05:46.088
Of course.

05:46.090 --> 05:47.557
Come on.

05:47.559 --> 05:48.858
You've been playing
since you walked

05:48.860 --> 05:50.560
through the fucking door.

05:52.497 --> 05:53.230
Wait.

05:53.232 --> 05:54.898
Put that fucking rifle down.

05:55.768 --> 05:57.533
Wait, wait.

05:57.535 --> 05:59.235
Ilir! What the,
what is it man?

05:59.237 --> 06:00.771
They are not here
for a deal, man.

06:00.773 --> 06:01.872
What are you talking about?

06:01.874 --> 06:02.973
Everybody, calm down.

06:02.975 --> 06:05.776
Don't tell me to
fucking calm down.

06:05.778 --> 06:07.810
These assholes are cops.

06:07.812 --> 06:09.879
Some piece of shit
traitor in our group

06:09.881 --> 06:12.815
have been feeding
them information.

06:12.817 --> 06:15.519
Do you want to get out
of here tonight alive?

06:15.521 --> 06:16.920
Tell me exactly
who the fuck is...

06:16.922 --> 06:18.721
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about, man!

06:18.723 --> 06:20.624
Wait! Just wait a minute, man.

06:20.626 --> 06:22.559
Take it easy.
Okay? Take it easy.

06:22.561 --> 06:24.026
No more bow downs, man.

06:24.028 --> 06:25.896
It's all about the do.

06:25.898 --> 06:27.163
They gonna get him through us.

06:27.165 --> 06:29.600
Do you fucking understand?

06:29.602 --> 06:32.569
Even if they're
cops my brother

06:32.571 --> 06:33.803
you can't afford to kill them.

06:33.805 --> 06:35.672
Do you understand that?

06:35.674 --> 06:38.774
When you start worrying
about fucking pigs?

06:38.776 --> 06:40.944
Seriously? You trying
to tell me something?

06:40.946 --> 06:42.245
Maybe.

06:42.247 --> 06:43.747
You're kidding me right now.

06:43.749 --> 06:46.016
After everything
we've been through.

06:46.018 --> 06:47.817
Give this one to me.

06:47.819 --> 06:51.788
Because this is some stressful
shit, and you're my friend.

06:51.790 --> 06:53.857
You wanna see loyalty?

06:53.859 --> 06:55.695
I'll show you loyalty.

06:57.062 --> 06:58.598
Give me the gun.

07:00.833 --> 07:02.035
Give me your gun.

07:03.903 --> 07:07.838
Come on give me the,
give me the fucking gun!

07:07.840 --> 07:11.841
I don't give a fuck if
they are cops, my brother.

07:11.843 --> 07:14.577
But if we kill them, we bring
down hate we don't need.

07:14.579 --> 07:16.949
But hey, you're the boss right?

07:18.583 --> 07:22.521
I'm here because I know
how to get things done.

07:23.456 --> 07:24.922
You've always been a
good judge of character

07:24.924 --> 07:26.889
right, my brother?

08:34.292 --> 08:35.861
Hold your fire!

08:40.399 --> 08:41.301
Don't move.

08:42.366 --> 08:45.235
Well done,
geniuses. You got me.

08:45.237 --> 08:46.637
Rei Cana.

08:46.639 --> 08:48.004
RENEA.

08:48.006 --> 08:49.373
ID 8711.

08:49.375 --> 08:50.176
Fuck.

09:17.069 --> 09:18.103
Ouch.

09:19.170 --> 09:20.839
Thank you for that.

09:21.841 --> 09:24.341
Gotta work on not catching
punches with my face, though.

09:24.343 --> 09:26.076
Tell you what pal,
here once you start,

09:26.078 --> 09:27.380
it's very difficult to stop.

09:31.116 --> 09:32.416
Thanks for the tip, dad.

09:32.418 --> 09:33.720
You guys done?

09:48.800 --> 09:50.033
Lieutenant, why
weren't we told

09:50.035 --> 09:52.436
there was undercover
working Ilir?

09:52.438 --> 09:54.336
It was need to know.

09:54.338 --> 09:56.943
After last night I'm
thinking we need to know.

09:58.876 --> 10:01.077
Well as proud as I am
about how far our department

10:01.079 --> 10:02.879
has come over the
years, there are still

10:02.881 --> 10:04.380
far too many leaks.

10:04.382 --> 10:07.283
With all due respect, I think
we've earned your trust sir.

10:07.285 --> 10:08.784
If it makes you
feel any better,

10:08.786 --> 10:10.088
I wasn't informed either.

10:11.022 --> 10:13.258
Until Captain Agim
here just briefed me.

10:15.026 --> 10:17.994
How do we know this guy
isn't playing both sides?

10:17.996 --> 10:19.730
How do I know you're
not as dumb as you look?

10:22.333 --> 10:24.934
Captain, everyone.

10:24.936 --> 10:25.771
Good morning.

10:26.905 --> 10:28.004
You okay?

10:28.006 --> 10:29.239
Fine.

10:29.241 --> 10:31.307
Okay, let's try to forget
we've gotten off to a bad start,

10:31.309 --> 10:33.179
and reintroduce ourselves.

10:34.246 --> 10:36.012
Captain Agim Hoxha here

10:36.014 --> 10:38.148
is our liaison to the
undercover section

10:38.150 --> 10:40.015
for the department
of neutralization

10:40.017 --> 10:42.318
of armed elements, RENEA.

10:42.320 --> 10:45.388
Detective Rei Cana, NYU
graduate criminal science

10:45.390 --> 10:47.393
and 20 years veteran of RENEA.

10:48.993 --> 10:52.095
Cana has been doing some
extensive undercover narcotics

10:52.097 --> 10:54.965
investigations for
quite some time now.

10:54.967 --> 10:58.000
These officers comprise our

10:58.002 --> 10:59.302
our lead strike team.

10:59.304 --> 11:02.205
Officers Elena
Pnishni, Kolo Salihi

11:02.207 --> 11:05.041
Enci Barisha, and Lorik Xhaka,

11:05.043 --> 11:06.275
the Yankee of our team.

11:06.277 --> 11:07.279
I'm Albanian.

11:08.514 --> 11:10.379
Raised in New York.

11:10.381 --> 11:13.082
The specializing special
task force interventions,

11:13.084 --> 11:14.350
and as you already know,

11:14.352 --> 11:17.055
Ilir was our most
recent objective.

11:18.357 --> 11:19.822
Good work everyone.

11:19.824 --> 11:22.359
If almost blowing my
cover and shooting me

11:22.361 --> 11:25.195
qualifies as good
work, then hey.

11:25.197 --> 11:26.363
Kudos boys and girls.

11:26.365 --> 11:27.831
Screw you, man.

11:27.833 --> 11:28.865
If there was
proper communication

11:28.867 --> 11:31.967
between both departments,
shit like last night

11:31.969 --> 11:33.138
wouldn't have happened.

11:33.872 --> 11:35.172
I can show
you where to put that.

11:35.174 --> 11:36.239
You think so?

11:36.241 --> 11:37.474
Try me.

11:37.476 --> 11:40.076
That's enough.

11:40.078 --> 11:41.110
We all want the same thing.

11:41.112 --> 11:43.212
Let's not forget that.

11:43.214 --> 11:45.447
Officers, from now
on, you are to report

11:45.449 --> 11:46.982
to Captain Hoxha.

11:46.984 --> 11:48.250
What?

11:48.252 --> 11:49.318
You're an excellent officer.

11:49.320 --> 11:51.120
They need you on this.

11:51.122 --> 11:52.589
So make me proud.

11:52.591 --> 11:54.291
Thank you, Lieutenant.

11:54.293 --> 11:56.229
Thank you, Captain.

11:57.161 --> 11:57.997
For Albania.

12:00.299 --> 12:01.968
Gentleman. Madame.

12:03.101 --> 12:04.303
Welcome to RENEA.

12:14.179 --> 12:15.014
Frank.

12:16.048 --> 12:17.447
Hmm?

12:17.449 --> 12:20.015
There's a problem.

12:20.017 --> 12:21.186
Hmm. Always.

12:28.926 --> 12:30.360
The interior
minister is calling

12:30.362 --> 12:32.294
a national collective effort

12:32.296 --> 12:36.066
in purging the country of
organized crime and corruption.

12:36.068 --> 12:39.302
We have to restore our
confidence and faith of justice

12:39.304 --> 12:40.971
in our citizens.

12:40.973 --> 12:43.139
Really? That's all.

12:43.141 --> 12:45.008
There is a push
from the parliament

12:45.010 --> 12:49.312
to propose that our
country be a member state

12:49.314 --> 12:51.214
of the European Union.

12:51.216 --> 12:54.283
And to do this, we need
to clean out some garbage.

12:54.285 --> 12:56.155
And how do you
plan on doing that?

12:57.622 --> 13:01.557
By systematically breaking
down individuals responsible

13:01.559 --> 13:03.326
we will intercept and destroy

13:03.328 --> 13:06.229
their business
operations from within.

13:06.231 --> 13:07.165
Who are we targeting?

13:11.169 --> 13:12.469
Frank Pedulla.

13:12.471 --> 13:14.140
He's pulling all the strings.

13:15.174 --> 13:18.240
Italian American operating
out from the United States.

13:18.242 --> 13:19.676
Nothing.

13:19.678 --> 13:22.849
Nothing goes down in
Albania without he say so.

13:23.949 --> 13:25.615
He controls it all.

13:25.617 --> 13:29.588
If we take him down, we cut
the head clean off the snake.

13:35.260 --> 13:36.095
Frankie.

13:37.429 --> 13:38.695
Hey.

13:38.697 --> 13:39.528
You good?

13:39.530 --> 13:40.596
Yeah?

13:40.598 --> 13:41.434
Yeah? Sit.

13:43.301 --> 13:44.366
You heard about Ilir?

13:44.368 --> 13:45.402
I did. He's a good boy.

13:45.404 --> 13:47.102
He knows what has to be done.

13:47.104 --> 13:48.340
I sure hope so.

13:50.007 --> 13:51.006
Look,

13:51.008 --> 13:52.509
times are changing.

13:52.511 --> 13:54.179
This isn't the 90s anymore.

13:55.146 --> 13:58.248
They're fighting for
European Union membership.

13:58.250 --> 14:01.287
They want things to be straight
and narrow now, Frankie.

14:02.288 --> 14:06.022
My guys are telling me this
shit is getting serious.

14:06.024 --> 14:10.259
Soon they'll be after me, and
then they might be after you.

14:10.261 --> 14:11.727
You got a gift

14:11.729 --> 14:13.064
for bringing this...

14:14.199 --> 14:17.267
This toxic suffocating energy

14:17.269 --> 14:19.201
into my space.

14:19.203 --> 14:23.038
I want you to lose it. I want
you to lose it, all right?

14:23.040 --> 14:25.408
And all this they,
they, they shit.

14:25.410 --> 14:26.543
For the record, from now on

14:26.545 --> 14:27.376
they is me.

14:27.378 --> 14:28.979
I'm they, all right?

14:28.981 --> 14:30.216
I'm as they as it gets.

14:31.349 --> 14:32.216
They look for me under the bed

14:32.218 --> 14:34.149
when they go to sleep
at night, right?

14:34.151 --> 14:35.518
Not the other
fucking way around.

14:35.520 --> 14:37.019
All right?

14:37.021 --> 14:38.388
You want a drink?

14:38.390 --> 14:39.221
Oh, Frank, I don't...

14:39.223 --> 14:40.423
Hey, Sonny.

14:40.425 --> 14:42.759
Take him downstairs,
get him a drink.

14:42.761 --> 14:44.159
It'll be two minutes.

14:44.161 --> 14:44.997
Okay.

15:03.548 --> 15:04.647
With this guy, we can't afford

15:04.649 --> 15:07.049
to make the slightest mistake.

15:07.051 --> 15:10.419
And we do that by
pinning down the guys

15:10.421 --> 15:12.524
in charge of his
domestic businesses here.

15:14.325 --> 15:15.392
Besnick Chaho.

15:15.394 --> 15:18.394
The heart of Pedulla's
operation in the country.

15:18.396 --> 15:19.397
His right hand man.

15:20.732 --> 15:22.398
Like Ilir.

15:22.400 --> 15:24.703
Ilir is just a
low level soldier.

15:25.636 --> 15:27.403
He pushes prostitution and drugs

15:27.405 --> 15:29.139
into the clubs and streets.

15:29.141 --> 15:31.374
But he knows some things.

15:31.376 --> 15:34.480
And we're going to find
out what those things are.

15:43.054 --> 15:43.689
My brother.

15:56.501 --> 15:57.336
Here.

16:12.284 --> 16:14.352
You're a fucking asshole.

16:15.386 --> 16:16.820
Yeah.

16:16.822 --> 16:18.520
But many would disagree
with you right now

16:18.522 --> 16:20.255
but that's important, is it?

16:20.257 --> 16:22.494
What's important is
what's going on with you.

16:26.631 --> 16:27.831
Believe it or not, Ilir,

16:27.833 --> 16:30.232
I honestly like you.

16:30.234 --> 16:32.101
Yeah, I know.

16:32.103 --> 16:33.571
That's why I'm here.

16:35.107 --> 16:37.474
And how long has
he been undercover?

16:37.476 --> 16:39.341
About a year.

16:39.343 --> 16:40.509
That's a long time.

16:40.511 --> 16:42.381
He must have
made some friends.

16:46.450 --> 16:47.285
Listen to me.

16:49.186 --> 16:50.887
You help us get Pedulla,

16:50.889 --> 16:52.889
and we will work
something out for you.

16:52.891 --> 16:56.826
If not, feel free to spend
the next 20 years in prison.

16:56.828 --> 16:57.730
This is up to you.

17:01.466 --> 17:03.469
You don't want to
see Hasan again?

17:08.306 --> 17:10.608
Keep her name out
of your fucking mouth.

17:11.776 --> 17:14.480
You ate at our table,
if you remember.

17:15.680 --> 17:18.146
Yeah, I remember.

17:18.148 --> 17:19.584
I remember Aldon.

17:20.385 --> 17:22.852
You don't want to
see Aldon grow up?

17:22.854 --> 17:24.287
Let me help you.

17:33.798 --> 17:35.164
Get him out of here!

17:37.469 --> 17:38.270
Enough!

19:50.534 --> 19:51.567
Nico?

19:51.569 --> 19:52.738
I'm Nico.

19:53.771 --> 19:55.404
Oh, whoa. Wait a minute.

19:55.406 --> 19:57.373
Your papa told me you
were 14 years old.

19:57.375 --> 19:58.944
You want to do
business, or what?

20:01.546 --> 20:02.615
Okay. Come. Sit.

20:07.484 --> 20:08.550
You want something?

20:08.552 --> 20:09.484
Baklava.

20:09.486 --> 20:10.686
Endri, you want something?

20:10.688 --> 20:12.488
Same for me.

20:12.490 --> 20:13.692
Two baklava.

20:16.493 --> 20:18.594
Okay. So what do you got?

20:18.596 --> 20:20.096
One of your guys coming
to Tirana next week.

20:20.098 --> 20:21.730
You know his name?

20:21.732 --> 20:22.768
Nope.

20:25.770 --> 20:27.603
You ever seen this guy before?

20:27.605 --> 20:28.438
Nope.

20:28.440 --> 20:29.071
You sure?

20:29.073 --> 20:29.905
Yeah.

20:29.907 --> 20:30.839
Okay.

20:30.841 --> 20:31.774
If you do you let me know.

20:31.776 --> 20:32.845
Very important.

20:34.412 --> 20:36.679
So, who's the big guy?

20:36.681 --> 20:37.913
My partner.

20:37.915 --> 20:39.414
You always so quiet?

20:39.416 --> 20:41.486
I only talk when
it's important.

20:43.555 --> 20:45.855
Okay, so your papa told me

20:45.857 --> 20:48.057
that you're gonna
make a drop from Besi.

20:48.059 --> 20:49.057
- Yup.
- When?

20:49.059 --> 20:49.991
- Friday.
- Where?

20:49.993 --> 20:51.794
At the club.

20:51.796 --> 20:52.627
Vena?

20:52.629 --> 20:53.464
Yup.

21:09.646 --> 21:10.613
Hey kid, do me a favor.

21:10.615 --> 21:11.913
When you make that drop,
you get out of there

21:11.915 --> 21:13.749
as fast as you can, okay?

21:13.751 --> 21:15.921
You do whatever you
have to do, but you go.

21:17.722 --> 21:18.723
You hear me?

21:31.970 --> 21:35.040
Hey Mary, put that
on my tab, please.

21:49.087 --> 21:50.856
Comfortable?

21:57.761 --> 22:00.829
You know, I won't be
here for much longer.

22:00.831 --> 22:01.833
Oh really?

22:03.467 --> 22:04.102
You think so?

22:10.774 --> 22:11.709
You know.

22:13.778 --> 22:15.914
You really do look familiar.

22:22.854 --> 22:23.889
Wow.

22:25.723 --> 22:26.558
Gerta.

22:27.959 --> 22:29.959
It's been a long time, baby.

22:29.961 --> 22:31.861
Hey come on, baby.
Don't be like that.

22:31.863 --> 22:33.563
Gerta! Gerta!

22:34.799 --> 22:37.403
Hey, Gerta! Come back! Gerta!

23:20.177 --> 23:22.713
Are we really here on
the word of some Gypsy?

23:24.182 --> 23:25.815
Rei trusts him.

23:25.817 --> 23:27.016
I trust him.

23:27.018 --> 23:28.921
Never trust a Gypsy. Never.

23:47.004 --> 23:49.105
Dude, you gotta
cheer up a little bit.

23:49.107 --> 23:49.939
We're having a good time.

23:49.941 --> 23:51.307
Hi, how you doing?

23:51.309 --> 23:52.807
You should pick her
up. She likes you.

23:52.809 --> 23:53.875
- I'm taken.
- Ask her out.

23:53.877 --> 23:55.111
I'm taken.

23:55.113 --> 23:56.711
You're married.
You're not dead.

23:56.713 --> 23:58.814
Said the guy with
two ex-wives, right?

23:58.816 --> 24:00.018
Hey, they both still love me.

24:01.049 --> 24:00.883
No they don't.

24:00.885 --> 24:02.054
Yes they do.

24:21.739 --> 24:23.642
I'm here to see Besi.

24:30.280 --> 24:32.216
Nico! What's up, kid?

24:35.853 --> 24:37.686
Nico's in.

24:37.688 --> 24:39.123
We're ready move
when you say so.

24:40.325 --> 24:42.995
Understood. Let's
move. Go. Now.

24:49.099 --> 24:50.202
Here we go.

24:51.368 --> 24:54.071
Go get him and
get out of there.

25:06.984 --> 25:08.152
Here we are.

25:09.287 --> 25:12.288
Two kilos of Britain's finest.

25:12.290 --> 25:15.357
You take this, then you
go straight to your papa.

25:15.359 --> 25:17.828
Can I go to the bathroom?

25:18.863 --> 25:20.363
Okay, but quickly.

25:20.365 --> 25:22.330
Then you go straight
to your papa.

25:22.332 --> 25:23.167
Okay.

25:43.087 --> 25:46.090
Hey, kid. Come
on. Hello. Come on.

25:48.225 --> 25:49.860
Wait, wait. Wait!

26:02.773 --> 26:03.405
Hey.

26:03.407 --> 26:04.707
What are you doing?

26:04.709 --> 26:06.107
Police work, you heard of it?

26:06.109 --> 26:07.042
Funny.

26:09.012 --> 26:09.944
Hey, pal.

26:09.946 --> 26:10.945
Table for two, I mean three,

26:10.947 --> 26:11.980
- how many of us?
- Four.

26:11.982 --> 26:13.915
Give us a fucking table.

26:22.092 --> 26:24.095
Besi. Besi, my brother

26:25.128 --> 26:27.328
what's up man, I'm back.

26:39.077 --> 26:41.743
Get on the ground. Now!

27:01.031 --> 27:03.901
You! Get the fuck out of here.

27:35.500 --> 27:37.066
Officer down. Officer down.

27:37.068 --> 27:38.500
Get me the fucking ambulance.

27:38.502 --> 27:40.001
Stay with me man.

27:40.003 --> 27:42.273
All units, move in. Move in!

27:48.913 --> 27:49.944
Come here you fucking nothing.

27:50.982 --> 27:53.182
Fuck you.

27:53.184 --> 27:54.849
What's happening?

27:54.851 --> 27:56.021
Come on man.

27:56.887 --> 27:59.188
Come on man. Stay with me.

27:59.190 --> 28:00.221
Hold on.

28:00.223 --> 28:01.323
What's happening there?

28:12.869 --> 28:13.871
I got you.

28:15.505 --> 28:17.105
Hold on, okay?

28:17.107 --> 28:19.909
Come on man, I'm
here. Come on man.

28:19.911 --> 28:20.542
Come on, stay with me.

28:20.544 --> 28:22.144
Stay with me, man.

28:22.146 --> 28:23.112
Please, dude.

28:23.114 --> 28:24.750
Come on, hold on.

28:33.223 --> 28:35.457
Get me the fucking
ambulance now!

28:35.459 --> 28:37.459
I've got an officer down!

28:37.461 --> 28:39.060
Officer down!

29:17.001 --> 29:17.633
I tried...

29:26.109 --> 29:27.478
I tried to save...

29:33.283 --> 29:34.151
I'm so sorry.

31:20.424 --> 31:22.223
How's Kolo?

31:22.225 --> 31:23.060
Good.

31:24.561 --> 31:27.496
The tough son of a bitch
refuses to stay home.

31:27.498 --> 31:29.167
He wants to stay on the case.

31:32.203 --> 31:33.338
And how's Lorik's family?

31:36.406 --> 31:37.309
Not well.

31:39.210 --> 31:40.409
What about Enci?

31:40.411 --> 31:43.114
No better. But he's focused.

31:47.484 --> 31:48.686
I'm sorry about Nico.

31:52.356 --> 31:53.657
We can't change what happened.

31:54.759 --> 31:58.460
But we can do
something about it.

31:58.462 --> 32:00.397
Grabbing Besi was
an important step.

32:01.632 --> 32:02.600
We're almost there.

32:06.369 --> 32:09.304
You think so?

32:09.306 --> 32:12.040
You're making a difference.

32:12.042 --> 32:14.311
Your mother and father
would be proud of you.

32:16.480 --> 32:17.315
Like I am.

32:19.482 --> 32:20.617
You need to see this.

32:21.684 --> 32:23.085
You okay?

32:23.087 --> 32:24.723
Just look. We
found it at Besi's.

32:41.504 --> 32:42.406
Morning, friend.

32:43.406 --> 32:44.376
Kiss my ass.

32:50.213 --> 32:52.117
You might want to
take a look at these.

32:56.087 --> 32:57.622
Found them at Besi's.

33:00.691 --> 33:02.156
Yeah.

33:10.467 --> 33:11.432
I don't know, maybe your friends

33:11.434 --> 33:13.501
aren't as loyal as you are.

33:13.503 --> 33:14.702
Because me, I'm
wondering why they have

33:14.704 --> 33:17.338
so many pictures of your kid,

33:17.340 --> 33:18.776
your wife, your family.

33:21.878 --> 33:22.713
Makes you wonder.

33:24.280 --> 33:25.750
Doesn't it, brother?

33:27.751 --> 33:28.586
Wait...

33:30.221 --> 33:31.155
Wait! Wait!

33:32.388 --> 33:34.222
Hey!

33:34.224 --> 33:35.059
Hey!

33:37.194 --> 33:38.430
Come back here!

33:39.629 --> 33:40.464
Come back!

33:47.704 --> 33:49.139
Am I being recorded?

33:50.540 --> 33:53.808
No. It's all off the record.

33:53.810 --> 33:56.513
I can assure you, this
case is highly classified.

33:58.915 --> 34:01.453
I want more than an assurance.

34:06.790 --> 34:09.422
You know Captain, me and
you have too many rats

34:09.425 --> 34:11.428
running inside our houses.

34:13.429 --> 34:14.466
Right, friend?

34:20.603 --> 34:21.672
Fuck this.

34:25.440 --> 34:27.478
I want protection for
my wife and my son.

34:29.344 --> 34:33.447
Guaranteed immunity, and
this is the only deal I have.

34:33.449 --> 34:34.585
Is it okay for you?

34:36.687 --> 34:37.755
It all right?

34:39.789 --> 34:40.721
I thought so.

34:40.723 --> 34:41.891
Yeah.

34:43.092 --> 34:45.928
I've been authorized to offer
protection for your family

34:45.929 --> 34:48.728
and immunity for
your cooperation.

34:48.731 --> 34:50.501
For your full cooperation.

34:51.768 --> 34:55.540
Anything less, and we bury you.

34:56.505 --> 34:57.541
Understood?

34:58.676 --> 34:59.511
Sign here.

35:21.298 --> 35:23.665
There's going to
be a drop next week.

35:23.667 --> 35:25.667
About half a million

35:25.669 --> 35:28.303
worth of Brital's dope.

35:28.305 --> 35:28.937
When next week?

35:28.939 --> 35:29.774
Sunday.

35:31.841 --> 35:33.875
Is Besnick Chaho
man in charge?

35:33.877 --> 35:35.477
He's in charge for everything.

35:35.479 --> 35:37.582
For distribution, shipping.

35:38.816 --> 35:41.549
You want the tumor
then you get the snake.

35:41.551 --> 35:42.687
And the buyers?

35:43.854 --> 35:45.921
Italians out of Naples.

35:45.923 --> 35:47.325
Where's it going down?

35:48.392 --> 35:50.558
Outside Vore, I think.

35:50.560 --> 35:52.829
Warehouse. Number eight.

35:59.569 --> 36:00.405
Fuck.

36:01.338 --> 36:02.973
This is fucking crazy.

36:04.941 --> 36:06.475
What's so funny?

36:06.477 --> 36:07.875
What's
so fucking funny?

36:07.877 --> 36:08.713
Yeah.

36:10.546 --> 36:11.648
We all talk.

36:12.649 --> 36:14.218
Everyone's a rat.

36:15.551 --> 36:17.486
Myself included.

36:17.488 --> 36:18.323
You know why?

36:19.689 --> 36:22.726
Because we all cheat.

36:24.327 --> 36:25.530
We all steal.

36:26.696 --> 36:27.765
We suck.

36:29.667 --> 36:31.636
For a piece of
cheese, or perhaps...

36:33.037 --> 36:34.468
That's enough.

36:34.470 --> 36:35.305
That's enough, but...

36:36.973 --> 36:39.341
You know Captain.

36:39.343 --> 36:43.745
If I were you, I'd be
careful who you trust.

36:43.747 --> 36:44.949
Am I right Gerta?

36:52.955 --> 36:54.323
Come back, baby,
I'm just kidding.

36:54.325 --> 36:55.524
- Shut the fuck up.
- Fuck you.

36:55.526 --> 36:56.357
Shut up.

36:56.359 --> 36:57.261
Fuck you.

37:06.870 --> 37:07.705
Hey.

37:09.707 --> 37:10.671
Hey.

37:10.673 --> 37:11.839
What?

37:11.841 --> 37:13.510
What was that? Who's Gerta?

37:14.345 --> 37:15.410
No clue.

37:15.412 --> 37:18.013
Is everything all right?

37:18.015 --> 37:20.716
I'm fine.

37:20.718 --> 37:21.549
Are you?

37:21.551 --> 37:22.386
Captain, I'm fine.

37:23.553 --> 37:24.388
Who's Gerta?

37:25.656 --> 37:26.491
Nobody.

37:27.725 --> 37:30.795
Listen, I've given
everything to this.

37:31.794 --> 37:33.995
You either trust me, or don't.

37:33.997 --> 37:35.796
That's up to you.

37:35.798 --> 37:37.665
Elena, we've come
too far for this

37:37.667 --> 37:38.767
to fall apart right now.

37:38.769 --> 37:41.903
We're with you no matter
what. You know that, right?

37:41.905 --> 37:44.805
No matter what? Are
you sure about that?

37:44.807 --> 37:46.006
I'm sure.

37:46.008 --> 37:48.142
No matter what you tell us
never leaves this room, right?

37:48.144 --> 37:48.945
Yeah.

38:01.091 --> 38:04.796
Gerta was a long
time ago. Another life.

38:08.698 --> 38:10.334
I worked for Besnick.

38:14.738 --> 38:15.707
Wait, worked as what?

38:18.841 --> 38:20.110
I was a stupid kid. 14.

38:22.780 --> 38:24.381
Saw an ad for new models.

38:25.883 --> 38:30.021
Sounded like a great
opportunity. It wasn't.

38:31.455 --> 38:32.090
Jesus.

38:33.890 --> 38:34.691
For how long?

38:35.959 --> 38:37.825
Until I finally
managed to get away.

38:39.763 --> 38:41.196
So now you know

38:41.198 --> 38:42.696
why I'm more committed to this

38:42.698 --> 38:44.368
than anyone else in this room.

38:45.769 --> 38:47.839
Look, I'm really
sorry, but Ilir?

38:50.707 --> 38:52.542
Friend of Besnick.

38:53.676 --> 38:55.146
Used to visit a lot.

38:57.147 --> 38:58.750
Can we get back...

39:02.051 --> 39:04.588
Can we get back to work now?

39:10.493 --> 39:11.595
Guys, please.

39:28.879 --> 39:29.781
Eyes, boss.

39:33.649 --> 39:34.850
Frank.

39:34.852 --> 39:35.819
They got Besi.

39:37.854 --> 39:41.892
The word is they're
coming after Besnick next.

39:43.660 --> 39:44.692
It's just a matter of time

39:44.694 --> 39:47.131
before they come
for us directly.

39:56.772 --> 39:57.872
Welcome back, brother.

39:57.874 --> 39:59.741
How you feeling?

39:59.743 --> 40:01.709
I'll feel better once
we get this bastard.

40:01.711 --> 40:02.546
I hear you.

40:09.685 --> 40:10.718
What are you doing?

40:10.720 --> 40:11.787
My job.

40:11.789 --> 40:14.622
No, you're going to
have to sit this one out.

40:14.624 --> 40:15.756
It's nothing. I'm fine.

40:15.758 --> 40:17.725
It's not debatable.

40:17.727 --> 40:18.963
Let's roll out, everyone.

40:20.664 --> 40:22.066
We'll see you soon.

40:25.202 --> 40:26.937
There's always
another day, brother.

42:44.774 --> 42:45.609
Hey people?

42:46.676 --> 42:47.310
It's Sunday.

42:52.415 --> 42:53.982
Listen

42:53.984 --> 42:55.620
whatever blows your dress up.

43:23.113 --> 43:24.015
Oh my love.

43:28.484 --> 43:29.986
You don't return my calls,

43:31.053 --> 43:32.155
you busted my factory.

43:34.457 --> 43:35.291
What did I do?

43:36.126 --> 43:37.459
We got a tip.

43:37.461 --> 43:39.060
You got a tip?

43:39.062 --> 43:39.993
A good one.

43:39.995 --> 43:41.863
Mm-hm. You find anything?

43:41.865 --> 43:42.830
No.

43:42.832 --> 43:44.799
Not a good tip.

43:46.803 --> 43:47.438
How's Ana?

43:48.738 --> 43:50.138
Good, thank you.

43:50.140 --> 43:51.138
Angela?

43:51.140 --> 43:52.309
Fine.

43:54.144 --> 43:57.044
22 years you
still busting my balls.

43:57.046 --> 43:59.881
I gotta be doing
something right.

44:02.852 --> 44:05.086
How did you know
we were coming?

44:05.088 --> 44:07.792
What makes you think I knew?

44:09.426 --> 44:11.892
We are taking back Albania.

44:11.894 --> 44:13.861
They're going to prosecute you.

44:13.863 --> 44:16.232
Gonna prosecute me? For what?

44:17.434 --> 44:19.769
Feeding 3000
Albanians every day?

44:20.437 --> 44:21.272
Come on.

44:22.539 --> 44:25.006
We both know who you
are and what you do.

44:25.008 --> 44:26.774
Hey, listen.

44:26.776 --> 44:28.442
There's this new king.

44:28.444 --> 44:30.180
And there's a lot
of desperate men.

44:33.816 --> 44:36.517
The only ones who will
benefit from all this

44:36.519 --> 44:38.319
are the Albanian people.

44:38.321 --> 44:39.156
How?

44:40.222 --> 44:41.890
What's changed?

44:41.892 --> 44:42.991
It's the same.

44:42.993 --> 44:46.130
Same Albanian citizens,
same politicians, same vows.

44:47.397 --> 44:48.562
What'd you vow?

44:48.564 --> 44:50.031
You vowed to protect
and to serve.

44:50.033 --> 44:50.832
What do you serve?

44:50.834 --> 44:52.232
Not even running water.

44:52.234 --> 44:55.102
No roads, no walls, no
infrastructure, no nothing.

44:55.104 --> 44:56.970
That was you, Agim.

44:56.972 --> 44:59.140
That was you and your
deficient government.

44:59.142 --> 45:00.073
Yeah.

45:00.075 --> 45:01.209
And you wanna turn a blind eye

45:01.211 --> 45:02.109
and you look the other way?

45:02.111 --> 45:03.343
Yeah, I built the
pipeline here, pal.

45:03.345 --> 45:06.046
That's mine. I get to keep it.

45:06.048 --> 45:08.015
I got the scars to prove it.

45:08.017 --> 45:09.417
So let's not go
there. All right?

45:09.419 --> 45:10.250
What do you got?

45:10.252 --> 45:11.155
You got fat.

45:12.354 --> 45:13.957
You all got fat. Come on.

45:14.825 --> 45:15.459
You know what?

45:17.060 --> 45:19.029
Sometimes I think
you forget something.

45:20.030 --> 45:23.834
That Albania made you,
not the other way around.

45:27.903 --> 45:29.937
And just because
your passport is blue

45:29.939 --> 45:31.175
doesn't make you untouchable.

45:32.408 --> 45:34.975
We are set on
righting our wrongs.

45:34.977 --> 45:36.211
You're setting it right?

45:36.213 --> 45:37.444
Well that sounds
like a plan, jeez.

45:37.446 --> 45:39.147
Take your SWAT team here,

45:39.149 --> 45:41.182
throw them right the fuck
in this jail right now.

45:41.184 --> 45:43.486
Yeah, and you'll set it right.

45:46.022 --> 45:48.423
And, what do you think?

45:48.425 --> 45:51.125
You think the people who
are calling it sleazy,

45:51.127 --> 45:53.264
you honestly believe
they're not criminals?

45:53.930 --> 45:55.529
They didn't commit murder.

45:55.531 --> 45:56.865
They didn't?

45:56.867 --> 45:58.366
Well where were you in '97?

45:58.368 --> 45:59.600
What were you doing?

45:59.602 --> 46:01.405
You singing with
the Albanian choir?

46:02.372 --> 46:04.471
That wasn't your little
finger on the trigger?

46:04.473 --> 46:05.540
Well, whose was it, then?

46:05.542 --> 46:06.975
I'll tell you whose.

46:06.977 --> 46:08.910
It was yours and
mine, Jimbo. Yeah.

46:08.912 --> 46:10.310
It was ours.

46:10.312 --> 46:11.212
You wanna know why?

46:11.214 --> 46:14.482
Because we gave this
country something.

46:14.484 --> 46:16.950
We gave it stability,
we gave it an economy.

46:16.952 --> 46:18.151
We gave it hope.

46:18.153 --> 46:19.553
And 4.5 billion a year.

46:19.555 --> 46:22.589
4.5 billion a year.

46:22.591 --> 46:24.091
Yeah, and what do you think?

46:24.093 --> 46:25.660
You think your
politicians, what,

46:25.662 --> 46:28.229
they don't wanna get
their dicks wet in that?

46:28.231 --> 46:30.163
The minister of
interior is targeting

46:30.165 --> 46:31.267
all your steps.

46:32.035 --> 46:34.234
Everything and
everyone, as I said

46:34.236 --> 46:36.303
it will go down with you.

46:36.305 --> 46:37.504
Brital included.

46:37.506 --> 46:39.475
You will answer
for your actions.

46:43.280 --> 46:47.247
My actions?

46:47.249 --> 46:48.351
My actions?

46:50.921 --> 46:52.556
You know what's funny?

46:55.091 --> 46:56.861
You once came running to me

46:58.260 --> 47:00.597
because you treated these
people here like dogs.

47:02.631 --> 47:04.933
You know what you are now?

47:04.935 --> 47:06.334
You're a tick.

47:08.305 --> 47:10.307
In the neck of the dogs.

47:15.278 --> 47:16.410
Mr. Padulla.

47:16.412 --> 47:20.147
You don't have to say another
word to these buffoons.

47:20.149 --> 47:23.887
What we needed to say,
I guess it got said.

47:28.158 --> 47:30.895
Okay, I'll see
you around, Jimbo.

47:33.229 --> 47:34.629
Hey, ciao everyone.

47:34.631 --> 47:37.464
Come back to me soon.
I appreciate it.

47:37.466 --> 47:40.069
Enjoy your summer. Seriously.

47:41.370 --> 47:44.040
Wait. Wait! Wait, wait wait!

47:45.040 --> 47:45.673
Wait!

47:45.675 --> 47:46.674
Hey, look at me!

47:46.676 --> 47:48.176
Fuck no!

47:48.178 --> 47:49.410
Fuck no!

47:49.412 --> 47:51.111
Fuck no.

47:51.113 --> 47:52.015
Look at me.

47:54.184 --> 47:55.218
I'll be seeing you.

48:03.193 --> 48:04.093
You good?

48:11.468 --> 48:12.569
So, please.

48:14.403 --> 48:15.638
Tell us what was this?

48:18.374 --> 48:20.010
It went exactly as I expected.

48:20.676 --> 48:21.511
Really?

48:22.412 --> 48:23.446
How so?

48:26.348 --> 48:27.184
He played us.

48:28.151 --> 48:29.350
He controls the game.

48:29.352 --> 48:31.486
Wanted to make
sure we knew that.

48:31.488 --> 48:32.620
We had him.

48:32.622 --> 48:34.154
And you let him go.

48:34.156 --> 48:36.357
What were we going
to hold him for?

48:36.359 --> 48:38.258
The warehouse was empty.

48:38.260 --> 48:39.292
What about Ilir?

48:39.294 --> 48:40.296
Yeah, he's a start.

48:41.731 --> 48:43.698
But we need more than a
word of a snitch in trouble

48:43.700 --> 48:45.169
looking for immunity.

48:46.535 --> 48:48.468
This runs deep.

48:48.470 --> 48:51.074
People in very powerful
positions are involved.

48:52.307 --> 48:54.341
If we want to pin
him down for good

48:54.343 --> 48:55.810
we have to play this smart.

48:55.812 --> 48:56.714
Be patient.

49:28.211 --> 49:30.147
Give it to him.

49:34.850 --> 49:35.783
Yeah.

49:35.785 --> 49:37.185
Did you see Besi?

49:37.187 --> 49:38.519
No.

49:38.521 --> 49:39.386
What about Ilir?

49:39.388 --> 49:40.423
No.

49:41.258 --> 49:44.658
Want me to
take care of him?

49:44.660 --> 49:45.792
Come on.

50:03.379 --> 50:04.214
Morning.

50:05.247 --> 50:06.082
Hey.

50:08.218 --> 50:09.383
Bad time?

50:09.385 --> 50:11.488
No, no. Come on in. Sit down.

50:15.357 --> 50:16.526
It's happened.

50:20.897 --> 50:22.529
So

50:22.531 --> 50:24.100
tell me the history.

50:25.502 --> 50:28.572
Well Frank was a friend
of mine. A good one.

50:30.305 --> 50:31.107
Okay.

50:32.508 --> 50:33.841
But why didn't
you tell the team?

50:33.843 --> 50:36.446
Why didn't you tell me?

50:37.580 --> 50:40.214
That was a long time ago

50:40.216 --> 50:41.318
in another life.

50:48.892 --> 50:50.892
Frank was an American marine

50:50.894 --> 50:51.794
served in Vietnam.

50:53.428 --> 50:54.761
He worked as a contractor

50:54.763 --> 50:56.696
helping Albanians in Corsica

50:56.698 --> 50:57.932
during the civil war.

50:57.934 --> 50:58.769
Training

51:00.769 --> 51:03.806
he saved a lot of
lives at that time.

51:04.941 --> 51:06.143
Mine included.

51:08.678 --> 51:11.279
He helped liberate our nation.

51:11.281 --> 51:13.884
After the war, saw
opportunity in Albania,

51:14.883 --> 51:16.517
made it his home.

51:16.519 --> 51:18.486
And created an empire.

51:18.488 --> 51:20.421
So he's a hero?

51:20.423 --> 51:21.258
He used to be.

51:22.459 --> 51:25.926
It's because of people like
that my parents are gone.

51:25.928 --> 51:27.895
It's why you lost your brother.

51:27.897 --> 51:29.897
Have faith in the system.

51:29.899 --> 51:31.598
Albania is changing, Rei,

51:31.600 --> 51:33.801
and most of it because
of people like yourself.

51:33.803 --> 51:36.507
People brave enough to
clean up the mess we made.

51:37.406 --> 51:38.205
Oh, no.

51:38.207 --> 51:38.839
No, no not me.

51:38.841 --> 51:40.607
I'm not that optimistic.

51:40.609 --> 51:42.209
But you have to, Rei.

51:42.211 --> 51:44.212
There is no other way.

51:44.214 --> 51:46.346
Trust in the law. In justice.

51:46.348 --> 51:48.385
In your people. In your home.

51:49.419 --> 51:50.587
You can't lose you, Rei.

51:55.225 --> 51:56.591
Yeah.

51:56.593 --> 51:57.558
Hey.

51:57.560 --> 51:58.662
One last thing.

52:00.763 --> 52:03.663
With all our security
issues, I've made a decision

52:03.665 --> 52:05.533
to transfer Besi and Ilir

52:05.535 --> 52:06.770
to a maximum security prison.

52:07.836 --> 52:08.671
Smart.

52:15.611 --> 52:18.714
Look, if Agim says he wants
more, we give him more.

52:20.515 --> 52:22.250
What do you mean?

52:22.252 --> 52:24.919
I mean we need to do
whatever has to be done.

52:24.921 --> 52:26.620
Ilir told us, if we want Pedulla

52:26.622 --> 52:28.455
we need to get Besnick.

52:28.457 --> 52:30.725
If Besnick really is in charge
of shipping and operations

52:30.727 --> 52:31.929
then he has the records.

52:33.997 --> 52:37.330
Weigh bills. Shipping
manifests. Contact lists.

52:37.332 --> 52:39.466
That will lead us directly
to the custom officials

52:39.468 --> 52:40.868
they have on their payroll.

52:40.870 --> 52:43.571
This is exactly what we need

52:43.573 --> 52:45.475
to tighten the noose on Pedulla.

52:46.975 --> 52:47.810
So...

52:50.680 --> 52:51.748
I say we hit Besnick.

52:53.548 --> 52:54.884
I say we hit him tonight.

52:56.486 --> 52:57.321
Who's in?

52:58.321 --> 52:59.687
I am.

52:59.689 --> 53:00.656
Yeah, absolutely.

53:03.660 --> 53:04.493
Why not?

53:11.734 --> 53:12.767
Are you sure you're
good with this?

53:12.769 --> 53:13.604
Yeah.

53:19.841 --> 53:22.676
Good luck. Stay safe.

53:22.678 --> 53:23.713
You too.

53:25.948 --> 53:26.946
They transferring them?

53:26.948 --> 53:28.883
Yup. Hurry up.

53:28.885 --> 53:32.256
Maximum security.
Come on, let's move.

53:43.665 --> 53:45.066
What's going on?

53:45.068 --> 53:46.100
Who knows?

53:46.935 --> 53:47.870
Let's move!

53:58.881 --> 54:00.548
Okay.

54:00.550 --> 54:01.716
We're gonna enter his
building through the back.

54:01.718 --> 54:03.350
There's a side entrance.

54:03.352 --> 54:05.653
It's big so we stay close.

54:05.655 --> 54:06.687
What are we expecting?

54:06.689 --> 54:08.055
Intel told me it'll be blank.

54:08.057 --> 54:09.457
Two toll people tops.

54:09.459 --> 54:10.991
And remember, it's
where he works

54:10.993 --> 54:12.993
not where he keeps his product.

54:12.995 --> 54:15.062
Let's just call it
his pleasure pad.

54:15.064 --> 54:18.131
Place where he likes to
entertain his friends.

54:18.133 --> 54:20.834
Again, it's big
so we stay close.

54:20.836 --> 54:21.669
Got it?

54:21.671 --> 54:22.705
Got it.

54:23.673 --> 54:24.774
Understood.

55:09.785 --> 55:10.854
Let's move.

55:12.754 --> 55:13.557
This way.

55:14.656 --> 55:15.689
Let's go.

55:15.691 --> 55:17.961
Come on, come on. Let's go.

56:02.772 --> 56:03.807
Go! Move!

56:44.946 --> 56:46.782
Hey. Enci, okay. Go.

57:30.892 --> 57:31.894
It's okay.

57:32.995 --> 57:34.731
We're here to help.

57:38.133 --> 57:39.899
What's your name?

57:39.901 --> 57:40.903
Gerta.

57:42.939 --> 57:43.740
Gerta?

57:44.941 --> 57:45.908
Where is he?

57:47.343 --> 57:48.144
There.

58:21.776 --> 58:23.877
Where's Elena?

58:23.879 --> 58:25.212
She was right behind me.

58:25.214 --> 58:26.049
Fuck.

58:55.211 --> 58:56.046
Drop it.

59:03.986 --> 59:05.021
Drop it.

59:27.042 --> 59:27.876
Well...

59:31.046 --> 59:31.880
Well...

59:34.082 --> 59:35.117
Well...

59:35.984 --> 59:37.019
Gerta.

59:49.397 --> 59:51.033
It's been so long.

59:55.705 --> 59:57.240
Oh, how I missed you.

59:59.408 --> 01:00:01.344
I knew you'd come back.

01:00:03.778 --> 01:00:05.848
They always do, you know.

01:00:08.417 --> 01:00:10.984
You all pretend
you don't like it

01:00:10.986 --> 01:00:12.088
but whores,

01:00:14.089 --> 01:00:16.022
they are what they are.

01:00:16.024 --> 01:00:16.992
but need a dad

01:00:19.227 --> 01:00:20.996
to take care of them.

01:00:24.834 --> 01:00:25.769
Don't they?

01:00:27.135 --> 01:00:30.837
Bitch!

01:00:37.312 --> 01:00:40.747
(bomb explodes!

01:01:04.039 --> 01:01:05.037
Fuck!

01:01:07.176 --> 01:01:08.475
Hey, hey! Come on!

01:01:08.477 --> 01:01:09.509
What the fuck are
you doing? Get away!

01:01:09.511 --> 01:01:10.444
Fucking open that door.

01:01:10.446 --> 01:01:11.879
You're gonna fucking ruin it.

01:01:11.881 --> 01:01:13.113
Get that fucking door
open right now, Enci.

01:01:13.115 --> 01:01:14.013
I'm doing my thing.
I'm doing my thing.

01:01:14.015 --> 01:01:15.184
Elena!

01:01:16.285 --> 01:01:18.120
Come on baby.

01:01:33.202 --> 01:01:34.200
Make it happen!

01:01:34.202 --> 01:01:35.437
I'm doing it!

01:02:25.888 --> 01:02:26.890
You bitch.

01:02:36.097 --> 01:02:38.397
You want to play? Let's play!

01:04:13.662 --> 01:04:15.194
Get that fucking
thing open, Enci!

01:04:15.196 --> 01:04:17.229
Don't rush me!

01:04:20.234 --> 01:04:22.102
You're a lot tougher

01:04:22.104 --> 01:04:23.239
than I remember.

01:04:28.209 --> 01:04:30.209
Because you couldn't stop.

01:04:30.211 --> 01:04:31.477
Change your clothes

01:04:31.479 --> 01:04:32.312
and your hair

01:04:33.548 --> 01:04:36.485
and that you don't
still belong to me.

01:04:38.053 --> 01:04:40.354
You'll always belong to me!

01:04:50.566 --> 01:04:52.232
Elena, you hold up!

01:04:52.234 --> 01:04:53.165
Okay, almost there.

01:04:53.167 --> 01:04:53.700
You're killing me!

01:05:36.377 --> 01:05:37.209
Come on, come on, come on.

01:05:37.211 --> 01:05:39.214
You're killing me, Enci.

01:06:46.414 --> 01:06:48.183
Good to see you, kids.

01:06:49.350 --> 01:06:51.450
Good to see you too, Sonny.

01:06:51.452 --> 01:06:52.421
We gotta go.

01:07:04.499 --> 01:07:06.802
Finally. Get me out of here.

01:07:07.736 --> 01:07:08.738
You fucking rat.

01:07:11.339 --> 01:07:12.374
I'm not a rat.

01:07:13.274 --> 01:07:14.242
I'm a father.

01:07:18.213 --> 01:07:19.312
Okay, got it! Got it!

01:07:19.314 --> 01:07:20.149
Move!

01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:30.626
Hey.

01:07:37.566 --> 01:07:39.265
Vega!

01:07:39.267 --> 01:07:39.868
Vega!

01:07:41.370 --> 01:07:42.472
We're not here for you.

01:07:43.437 --> 01:07:45.571
Stand down, old man.

01:07:45.573 --> 01:07:46.441
We're leaving.

01:07:48.510 --> 01:07:49.511
You're lucky.

01:08:01.222 --> 01:08:01.955
- What the fuck?
- Come on.

01:08:01.957 --> 01:08:03.326
What'd I do?

01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:05.862
What? What'd I do?

01:08:15.604 --> 01:08:17.504
Holy shit. You all right?

01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:20.774
Come on. Careful.

01:08:22.511 --> 01:08:24.510
She just killed our best lead.

01:08:24.511 --> 01:08:25.711
Yes, I did.

01:08:25.712 --> 01:08:27.279
You okay?

01:08:27.281 --> 01:08:28.982
Now I am.

01:08:28.984 --> 01:08:29.883
Convenient.

01:08:29.885 --> 01:08:31.684
What's convenient?

01:08:31.685 --> 01:08:32.654
What did you say?

01:08:33.888 --> 01:08:35.522
I mean come on.

01:08:35.524 --> 01:08:37.624
We know how Pedulla works.

01:08:37.626 --> 01:08:39.259
Always one step ahead.

01:08:39.261 --> 01:08:40.594
- She...
- Go to hell.

01:08:40.595 --> 01:08:41.428
No, no, no, no, no.

01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:42.261
Hey!

01:08:42.263 --> 01:08:43.330
Piece of shit!

01:08:43.332 --> 01:08:44.930
Shut up! Shut up!

01:08:44.932 --> 01:08:45.764
Hey, shut up listen! Silence!

01:08:47.435 --> 01:08:48.335
Request
for officer assist.

01:08:48.337 --> 01:08:50.569
Prisoner transport
elusive lost cause.

01:08:50.571 --> 01:08:52.639
Maximum location has reports
of automatic gunfire, and...

01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:53.740
Your gun.

01:08:53.742 --> 01:08:55.341
We are a team.

01:08:55.343 --> 01:08:56.345
Deal with it.

01:08:57.011 --> 01:08:57.913
Let's go!

01:09:33.481 --> 01:09:34.316
No.

01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:51.934
You.

01:09:54.569 --> 01:09:57.673
Give me a look at
your fucking phone.

01:09:58.707 --> 01:09:59.542
What?

01:10:01.877 --> 01:10:03.946
I said give me your
fucking phone. Now!

01:10:04.879 --> 01:10:06.481
You give it to me right now.

01:10:07.582 --> 01:10:08.848
You crazy?

01:10:08.850 --> 01:10:11.318
Give me a look at
your fucking phone.

01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:12.685
Right now.

01:10:12.687 --> 01:10:14.688
You're the only one I
told the transfer about.

01:10:14.690 --> 01:10:17.924
Give me a look at
your phone right now.

01:10:17.926 --> 01:10:19.829
All right, all right.

01:10:24.732 --> 01:10:25.568
Fuck.

01:10:29.704 --> 01:10:31.337
You...

01:10:31.339 --> 01:10:32.275
You did...

01:10:33.675 --> 01:10:34.810
You did it. You.

01:10:37.645 --> 01:10:39.381
Now I'm gonna kill you.

01:10:40.781 --> 01:10:41.617
No.

01:10:42.818 --> 01:10:44.617
I'm gonna drive away.

01:10:44.619 --> 01:10:47.920
Oh no. You're
not going anywhere.

01:10:47.922 --> 01:10:50.693
You can't run from this. Never.

01:10:52.427 --> 01:10:53.062
No.

01:10:54.930 --> 01:10:57.663
Everyone made
their own choices.

01:10:57.665 --> 01:11:00.800
My mistake was waiting
so long to wake up.

01:11:00.802 --> 01:11:02.605
I was done being
on the losing side.

01:11:03.939 --> 01:11:05.938
This can't be happening.

01:11:05.940 --> 01:11:07.842
You're the fucking rat!

01:11:09.043 --> 01:11:11.877
Think that you're
making a difference?

01:11:11.879 --> 01:11:12.978
They've been killing each other

01:11:12.980 --> 01:11:14.546
for as long as I can remember.

01:11:14.548 --> 01:11:17.783
You catch them, and
they buy their way out.

01:11:17.785 --> 01:11:19.919
Same shit

01:11:19.921 --> 01:11:22.691
What the hell is the
point? What's the point?

01:11:25.427 --> 01:11:26.729
What about Nico?

01:11:29.530 --> 01:11:31.898
You killed Nico.
He was just a kid.

01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:33.002
What about that point?

01:11:35.803 --> 01:11:37.573
He recognized me.

01:11:45.846 --> 01:11:50.819
I had no choice.

01:11:54.989 --> 01:11:56.758
No, I had a choice.

01:12:04.699 --> 01:12:05.865
I have it.

01:12:22.217 --> 01:12:25.184
Today marks one
of the darkest days

01:12:25.186 --> 01:12:27.853
in our nation's history.

01:12:27.855 --> 01:12:29.855
While we still don't
know all the facts,

01:12:29.857 --> 01:12:31.858
what we do know is
that there has been

01:12:31.860 --> 01:12:35.862
a vicious, calculated,
and despicable attack

01:12:35.864 --> 01:12:37.500
against our law enforcement.

01:12:38.566 --> 01:12:43.705
We vow that we will not stop
until all those responsible

01:12:44.739 --> 01:12:48.073
are brought to justice for
this horrific atrocity.

01:12:48.075 --> 01:12:51.643
For far too long has
our country been abused

01:12:51.645 --> 01:12:52.745
by organized crime.

01:12:52.747 --> 01:12:55.784
Today we push back.

01:12:57.252 --> 01:13:01.790
We will end this epidemic
of chaos and destruction.

01:13:03.557 --> 01:13:04.159
Thank you.

01:13:13.802 --> 01:13:15.167
Mr. Pedulla.

01:13:15.169 --> 01:13:19.138
I'm so sorry. I had no
idea who he was for you.

01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:19.973
I thought he was just...

01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:34.457
Get him out of here.

01:14:19.133 --> 01:14:19.968
Rei.

01:14:23.805 --> 01:14:25.071
Listen.

01:14:25.073 --> 01:14:25.971
We can do...

01:14:25.973 --> 01:14:27.575
We can do what?

01:14:31.913 --> 01:14:34.083
Pedulla's been playing
us the entire time.

01:14:35.917 --> 01:14:36.752
Kolo.

01:14:38.153 --> 01:14:39.154
Pulling the strings.

01:14:42.656 --> 01:14:45.026
Ilir knew you were cops
when you showed up.

01:14:46.595 --> 01:14:47.859
And he knew he had
a rat on his team

01:14:47.861 --> 01:14:49.931
but he didn't know who.

01:14:52.833 --> 01:14:57.069
Kolo.

01:14:57.071 --> 01:15:01.075
He told Pedulla we were
gonna put a hit on Vena.

01:15:03.345 --> 01:15:04.613
He killed Nico.

01:15:05.312 --> 01:15:06.649
Yes, but he was shot.

01:15:07.315 --> 01:15:08.747
Yeah.

01:15:08.749 --> 01:15:10.215
I checked the report,
they said they found

01:15:10.217 --> 01:15:12.352
powder burns on his shirt.

01:15:14.088 --> 01:15:15.621
He must have done
that to himself

01:15:15.623 --> 01:15:16.956
just to back up his story.

01:15:16.958 --> 01:15:19.325
Let Pedulla know every
move we were making.

01:15:19.327 --> 01:15:20.960
Agim was right!

01:15:20.962 --> 01:15:23.062
He's been knocking us out

01:15:23.064 --> 01:15:25.098
every single fucking time.

01:15:28.069 --> 01:15:29.635
Hey, hey!

01:15:29.637 --> 01:15:30.937
- Listen to me!
- God!

01:15:30.939 --> 01:15:31.970
Look at me.

01:15:31.972 --> 01:15:32.839
We just can't watch.

01:15:32.841 --> 01:15:35.407
We've been cleared
to take on Brital.

01:15:35.409 --> 01:15:37.175
All this anger

01:15:37.177 --> 01:15:38.710
all this rage

01:15:38.712 --> 01:15:39.347
use it!

01:15:40.914 --> 01:15:41.950
Okay?

01:15:44.985 --> 01:15:45.820
Come here.

01:16:08.176 --> 01:16:10.379
I-41. We are close.

01:16:12.346 --> 01:16:15.050
Alpha 1 to Alpha
11, listen up.

01:16:16.316 --> 01:16:18.951
They brought the fight to us.

01:16:18.953 --> 01:16:19.788
Tirana.

01:16:21.155 --> 01:16:23.758
They took our brothers,
now we're gonna take them.

01:16:25.392 --> 01:16:27.460
Brital's drug operation
goes down today,

01:16:27.462 --> 01:16:29.298
but this will get hot.

01:16:31.065 --> 01:16:32.365
This is hostile territory.

01:16:32.367 --> 01:16:35.033
Do not underestimate
what I am saying.

01:16:35.035 --> 01:16:36.902
Everyone in the storage
will be gunning for us

01:16:36.904 --> 01:16:38.306
and I need everyone

01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:43.011
to make sure to
let that sink in.

01:16:46.815 --> 01:16:47.982
We got it now.

01:16:51.218 --> 01:16:53.221
For our fallen brothers.

01:16:55.289 --> 01:16:57.126
For lieutenant Ramone.

01:16:58.760 --> 01:16:59.762
Lorik Xhaka.

01:17:02.329 --> 01:17:03.698
Captain Hoxha.

01:17:06.133 --> 01:17:08.837
Now let's get this thing done.

01:18:44.399 --> 01:18:45.968
They're coming.

01:19:29.177 --> 01:19:31.079
Let's play with them.

01:22:15.142 --> 01:22:15.977
RPG!

01:22:26.654 --> 01:22:29.188
RPGs? They got fucking RPGs?

01:22:29.190 --> 01:22:30.258
Let's move.

01:22:31.559 --> 01:22:32.494
Let's move!

01:24:55.903 --> 01:24:57.138
Holy shit.

01:24:58.538 --> 01:25:00.639
They got weed stacked
to the rafters.

01:25:00.641 --> 01:25:01.874
Yeah.

01:25:01.876 --> 01:25:03.811
This and every other
house in the village.

01:25:06.881 --> 01:25:08.947
They're not soldiers,
they're villagers.

01:25:08.949 --> 01:25:10.618
With AKs and RPGs.

01:25:11.686 --> 01:25:13.522
We gotta get moving.

01:26:20.421 --> 01:26:21.356
Man down!

01:26:23.423 --> 01:26:26.625
Alpha 1 to Alpha 7, we
need the sniper gun now.

01:26:26.627 --> 01:26:28.964
You heard him. Move. Move.

01:26:30.664 --> 01:26:35.669
Alpha 1,
we are heading to high ground.

01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:21.013
This is 712.

01:27:21.015 --> 01:27:21.846
We need the sniper...

01:27:27.555 --> 01:27:28.556
Fucking now!

01:27:45.739 --> 01:27:47.673
Fucker's
down. You're clear.

01:28:58.178 --> 01:28:59.944
Alpha 10 to
Alpha 1. Hold your fire.

01:28:59.946 --> 01:29:02.717
Coming around to your location.

01:29:34.614 --> 01:29:35.546
Stay on him.

01:29:35.548 --> 01:29:36.885
I got him. Go!

01:32:08.168 --> 01:32:09.401
Hey...

01:32:09.403 --> 01:32:12.073
Hey. Hey.

01:32:13.906 --> 01:32:14.943
You okay?

01:32:15.909 --> 01:32:16.945
Yeah?

01:32:17.878 --> 01:32:20.048
Come on. Let's go get him.

01:32:20.881 --> 01:32:22.115
Good, good, good.

01:32:24.051 --> 01:32:25.282
Yeah.

01:35:22.296 --> 01:35:23.830
Where'd he go?

01:36:08.574 --> 01:36:10.608
Don't you move!

01:36:10.610 --> 01:36:13.911
Don't you move,
you're under arrest.

01:36:13.913 --> 01:36:15.081
No, I'm not.

01:36:22.922 --> 01:36:23.557
I'm over.

01:36:25.057 --> 01:36:26.226
I'm just over.

01:36:37.337 --> 01:36:38.172
All this.

01:36:40.574 --> 01:36:42.276
I'm over all this.

01:36:43.276 --> 01:36:44.110
Yeah.

01:36:45.177 --> 01:36:47.214
You made your choices.

01:36:52.285 --> 01:36:53.119
Yeah.

01:36:57.156 --> 01:36:58.191
So who are you?

01:37:01.328 --> 01:37:02.495
Are you ticks?

01:37:07.234 --> 01:37:08.369
Or are you dogs?

01:39:33.783 --> 01:39:38.783
