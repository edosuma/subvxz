WEBVTT

00:07.291 --> 00:08.903
<i>Previously on Roadies...</i>

00:08.954 --> 00:09.886
Guess what?

00:09.916 --> 00:10.866
You're about to find out what it's like

00:10.896 --> 00:12.290
on the other side of the fence.

00:12.325 --> 00:15.593
I know where all the bodies are buried.

00:15.812 --> 00:17.448
Christopher's drinking again.

00:17.596 --> 00:20.230
And hanging by a fucking thread.

00:20.566 --> 00:23.042
Okay, you need to tell everybody
who's gonna be hired

00:23.093 --> 00:24.468
to go on the European leg.

00:24.504 --> 00:26.570
I just... I just
assumed that everyone was going.

00:26.647 --> 00:28.547
Sean's father just passed away.

00:28.741 --> 00:31.666
We got a problem. Shelli's
got to fly home.

00:32.369 --> 00:33.427
I'll see you, okay?

00:37.277 --> 00:39.534
The other day, I found this old
hard drive from when I was 16,

00:39.585 --> 00:41.722
and I read this letter
I wrote to myself.

00:41.773 --> 00:42.920
Amazing piece of writing.

00:42.956 --> 00:44.725
Of course it was. It was my hard drive.

00:44.776 --> 00:45.864
Well, here.

00:46.054 --> 00:47.291
You take it then.

00:47.978 --> 00:49.026
It's awesome.

00:49.062 --> 00:52.539
Harvey, I need you to be
loyal to me right now.

00:52.969 --> 00:54.773
Preston wants Tom to go solo.

00:55.534 --> 00:57.381
I was brought in to break up the band.

01:03.223 --> 01:05.421
"Today, I am 16.

01:06.305 --> 01:09.553
Today, I become a person
who will claim their life,

01:10.390 --> 01:12.404
who will make decisions instantly,

01:12.434 --> 01:14.371
who will never look back.

01:14.755 --> 01:17.823
Today, I become the person
who will be blazingly true

01:17.853 --> 01:20.116
in a world of violent bullshit.

01:21.251 --> 01:25.438
Today, I promise myself
as a person and as an artist

01:25.468 --> 01:27.647
I will never, ever sell out."

01:27.677 --> 01:29.464
- All right.
- All right.

01:30.153 --> 01:31.506
It's time to sell out.

01:31.536 --> 01:33.811
It's our first fucking corporate gig.

01:34.282 --> 01:35.578
We'll do three songs.

01:35.608 --> 01:38.023
The band will make a lot
of money we'll never see.

01:38.053 --> 01:40.643
Now, if you detect a bit of cynicism,

01:40.673 --> 01:42.772
it's because I knew men and women

01:42.802 --> 01:45.955
who wrote songs that actually
changed the fucking world

01:45.985 --> 01:48.315
without taking money
from a rubber company.

01:48.345 --> 01:49.669
Hear, hear!

01:49.699 --> 01:52.924
And also, our corporate friends
have invited us to a party

01:52.954 --> 01:55.264
after the set, and they
respectfully asked

01:55.294 --> 01:57.386
that we wear something clean.

01:57.416 --> 01:58.872
I only got, like, one clean thing.

01:58.902 --> 02:00.677
- Well, throw it on then.
- All right.

02:00.707 --> 02:02.967
All right, and as Jimi Hendrix
once said while he was

02:02.997 --> 02:05.021
high as fuck on acid:

02:05.718 --> 02:08.162
"Stay groovy and stay free."

02:08.192 --> 02:09.639
- Ow!
- Ow!

02:12.144 --> 02:13.495
Hold on.

02:14.294 --> 02:15.992
I've got something to share.

02:17.978 --> 02:19.907
Last night, I had a dream.

02:22.111 --> 02:24.364
A dream about a melting animal.

02:29.406 --> 02:32.994
It will happen tonight.

02:35.183 --> 02:36.138
All right.

02:36.168 --> 02:38.362
Why don't you guys grab your
key packets from the manager?

02:38.392 --> 02:39.308
I'll see you in there.

02:39.338 --> 02:40.268
You're gonna like your rooms.

02:40.298 --> 02:41.742
They're good rooms. Okay.

02:41.892 --> 02:44.463
Take it easy. It's okay.

02:44.879 --> 02:46.676
Holy shit, Puna.

02:46.706 --> 02:48.338
You've got to give me more.

02:48.368 --> 02:50.523
I don't have any more.

02:50.868 --> 02:52.295
Be careful.

02:59.803 --> 03:01.163
What'd he just say?

03:02.368 --> 03:03.849
Hey, this'll perk you up.

03:03.879 --> 03:06.484
Fun Co supplies the synthetic rubber

03:06.514 --> 03:09.746
for Maureen Butler's latest active bra.

03:09.776 --> 03:11.340
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

03:11.370 --> 03:14.523
Weren't you and Maureen Butler
an item once upon a night?

03:14.553 --> 03:16.484
Yeah, about a million years ago,

03:16.514 --> 03:19.463
back when she was just
a backup singer for Usher.

03:19.493 --> 03:22.568
The thing is, Phil,
there's... There's no need to mention

03:22.598 --> 03:24.507
any of this to Shelli, okay?

03:24.537 --> 03:26.008
Bill, Shelli went home.

03:26.038 --> 03:27.259
The spell's broken.

03:27.289 --> 03:28.368
The spell?

03:28.398 --> 03:29.786
The road spell.

03:29.816 --> 03:31.953
Going home breaks the spell.

03:32.205 --> 03:34.623
It's pictures on the refrigerator, dude.

03:34.653 --> 03:36.263
It's her sleeping in her own bed,

03:36.293 --> 03:37.966
fucking her own husband.

03:39.343 --> 03:41.317
Look, it had to happen.

03:41.347 --> 03:43.590
But maybe it's a blessing in disguise.

03:43.718 --> 03:45.842
You know, Maureen Butler's
gonna be here.

03:45.872 --> 03:48.271
I doubt she'd ever even remember me.

03:48.357 --> 03:49.748
Yeah, you're probably right.

03:49.778 --> 03:52.338
A billion dollars in yoga pants sales

03:52.776 --> 03:54.782
tend to erase one's memory.

03:55.054 --> 03:56.781
I was just trying to
find the silver lining

03:56.811 --> 03:58.554
in the sow's ear, as they say.

03:58.584 --> 04:01.240
What, the silver line...
The silver lining

04:01.270 --> 04:02.451
in what kind of ear?

04:02.481 --> 04:03.938
What'd you say?

04:04.463 --> 04:05.294
I don't know.

04:05.324 --> 04:07.720
I don't always listen
to myself very close.

04:11.417 --> 04:13.056
No, you're right.

04:16.370 --> 04:17.923
It had to end.

04:22.270 --> 04:24.309
Thank you, White Buffalo.

04:24.678 --> 04:27.387
Hey, um, did our Hawaiian friend

04:27.417 --> 04:29.951
say it will happen tonight?

04:31.098 --> 04:33.479
Your story changed
my life, White Buffalo.

04:38.567 --> 04:40.096
Hey, Wes.

04:40.127 --> 04:41.423
Yeah.

04:42.315 --> 04:44.887
Only I call him White Buffalo.

04:45.651 --> 04:46.916
Oh.

04:48.661 --> 04:49.948
Sorry.

Bill Hanson.
-Yeah.

06:02.689 --> 06:04.262
Hi, I'm Robin, your Fun Co liaison.

06:04.292 --> 06:06.761
Hey, Robin. Good to meet you.
-Welcome to the Fun Co experience.

06:06.791 --> 06:07.780
It's an experience?

06:07.810 --> 06:09.637
You know it!
-Where are we storing gear?

06:09.677 --> 06:11.187
In the James Monroe Ballroom,

06:11.217 --> 06:12.594
just to the left of the coronation room.

06:12.624 --> 06:15.409
Thank you ... Robin.

06:15.439 --> 06:16.760
Excuse me.

06:17.082 --> 06:19.852
You'll be after Future,
Phantogram, alt-J,

06:19.882 --> 06:21.490
and just before Gwen Stefani.

06:21.520 --> 06:23.312
And as you know,
the master of ceremonies

06:23.342 --> 06:24.210
is David Spade.

06:24.240 --> 06:25.268
David Spade, great.

06:25.298 --> 06:26.769
We're all big Dead Sex fans.

06:26.799 --> 06:28.371
- That's exciting.
- Yes, you know it.

06:28.401 --> 06:30.545
And Jack Peltz cannot wait
to meet the Staton-House Band.

06:30.575 --> 06:33.089
Oh, my guys are so thrilled
to meet Mr. Peltz.

06:33.119 --> 06:34.443
Great. He's a big fan.

06:34.473 --> 06:35.881
I'll see ya. Nice to meet you.

06:35.911 --> 06:37.250
You too.

06:37.787 --> 06:39.448
I've just googled Fun Co.

06:39.478 --> 06:41.894
These guys don't
just stop at rubber toys.

06:41.924 --> 06:44.711
They make the most lethal
rubber bullet on the market.

06:44.741 --> 06:46.184
Dude, rubber bullets don't kill people.

06:46.214 --> 06:48.255
This one does. It's called
"The Imploder."

06:48.285 --> 06:51.503
It kills you with a red-hot
explosion of rubber.

06:51.590 --> 06:52.964
Warm cookie?

06:54.731 --> 06:56.397
Those are oddly shaped.

06:56.427 --> 06:57.961
Who the fuck cares, man? They're free.

06:57.991 --> 07:00.804
They're in the shape of the
original Fun Co eraser.

07:00.834 --> 07:02.309
Fascinating.

07:02.662 --> 07:03.996
I know.

07:07.263 --> 07:09.165
Listen, Chelsea, I'm calling because

07:09.195 --> 07:11.432
I need to speak to Edgar urgently,

07:11.462 --> 07:13.287
and it concerns Extantion business,

07:13.317 --> 07:16.930
but also, it concerns ... me.

07:18.609 --> 07:19.935
Chelsea.

07:20.761 --> 07:22.600
Chelsea. Fuck!

07:22.806 --> 07:24.835
Why d... why do you keep looking at Reg?

07:24.865 --> 07:25.547
- I'm not.
- Oh, shit.

07:25.577 --> 07:27.236
By the way, I didn't tell you.
We're all going to Europe.

07:27.266 --> 07:29.393
- Wait, what? When?
- What?

07:29.423 --> 07:31.239
He told me we're all gonna go on the SHB

07:31.269 --> 07:32.769
European leg of the tour.

07:32.799 --> 07:33.969
- All of us?
- Yeah.

07:33.999 --> 07:36.490
Oh, that's sick!
-Oh!

07:36.742 --> 07:37.722
Oh, my God.

07:37.752 --> 07:39.244
I got to find the devil child.

07:39.274 --> 07:40.382
We've got property to destroy.

07:40.412 --> 07:42.156
I'm so fucking happy.

07:45.043 --> 07:48.678
Shelli, thank God. I thought
you had gone home.

07:48.797 --> 07:50.366
Couldn't stay away from ya.

07:50.719 --> 07:52.292
You look happy.

07:52.379 --> 07:54.738
You do. You look... happy.

07:54.768 --> 07:57.147
Wow, thanks, guys.

07:57.422 --> 07:58.852
It's good to see you.

07:58.882 --> 08:01.336
Preston talked us into saying
yes to this fucking

08:01.366 --> 08:03.662
dog and pony show, and he
doesn't even bother to show.

08:03.692 --> 08:04.731
I know.

08:04.761 --> 08:07.457
We used to laugh at other bands
for doing stuff like this.

08:07.487 --> 08:10.734
I feel so ... separate from Chris.

08:11.048 --> 08:11.955
I can't explain it.

08:11.985 --> 08:13.118
You don't have to.

08:13.148 --> 08:15.436
You love him, but you can
barely stand to look at him.

08:15.466 --> 08:17.056
Rick's got Natalie now.

08:17.086 --> 08:18.114
I mean, he's never been better,

08:18.144 --> 08:19.297
but he's got all these opinions,

08:19.327 --> 08:20.696
and you love him too.

08:20.726 --> 08:22.151
But frankly, it was easier for you

08:22.181 --> 08:23.938
when he was a sweet pickled fuckup.

08:23.968 --> 08:25.354
- Exactly.
- Mm.

08:25.384 --> 08:28.634
See, this is why you
should be managing this band.

08:29.960 --> 08:30.980
Really?

08:31.010 --> 08:31.908
Think about it.

08:31.938 --> 08:33.062
But it's just between us.

08:33.092 --> 08:34.426
It's not about Bill.

08:34.456 --> 08:36.580
He always takes Chris's side.

08:37.128 --> 08:39.070
That's why I can't really trust him.

08:40.010 --> 08:42.042
Not like I can trust you.

08:44.518 --> 08:46.530
So don't tell Bill, okay?

08:47.446 --> 08:48.806
Of course.

08:55.045 --> 08:55.851
Hi.

08:55.881 --> 08:57.243
You're back.

08:57.713 --> 08:59.485
You didn't stay for the funeral?

08:59.515 --> 09:01.923
I... you know, I
felt like I should be here.

09:01.953 --> 09:04.891
I mean, I knew this gig
would be a clusterfuck.

09:04.921 --> 09:07.791
Yeah, well, Tom's really on edge.

09:07.938 --> 09:09.135
O-oh, really?

09:09.165 --> 09:10.872
Yeah, because Christopher's
not here yet.

09:10.902 --> 09:12.079
But it's okay; I'm on it.

09:12.109 --> 09:15.861
He just wanted to return the
yearbook to his mother's house.

09:18.003 --> 09:19.137
What?

09:19.167 --> 09:20.478
Nothing.

09:20.639 --> 09:22.685
You just look like you got
something on your mind.

09:22.715 --> 09:24.329
Uh, no, no. I just...

09:24.359 --> 09:27.068
I mean, how do we deal with this?

09:29.015 --> 09:31.403
You know what? I, uh...

09:31.433 --> 09:33.439
I've actually been
giving it a lot of thought,

09:33.469 --> 09:35.218
and I think, uh...

09:36.161 --> 09:39.537
I think that the most
simple way ... to deal with it

09:39.567 --> 09:44.787
is to, uh, forget that any
of it ever happened ...  between us,

09:44.817 --> 09:48.636
and, uh, if you're concerned

09:48.666 --> 09:50.078
that I won't be able to do that,

09:50.108 --> 09:51.462
don't be.

09:52.065 --> 09:54.838
I meant, how do we deal
with Tom being upset,

09:54.968 --> 09:56.955
but fine, it's good to know.

09:56.985 --> 09:58.510
Okay, I'm sorry. I thought that...

09:58.540 --> 10:00.486
I didn't mean to... I thought you...
-No, I'm glad you were honest.

10:00.548 --> 10:01.771
I mean, we have to be
honest with each other.

10:01.801 --> 10:03.546
- You know it.
- Okay.

10:03.576 --> 10:06.769
Speaking of which, apparently,

10:06.855 --> 10:10.741
Maureen Butler is coming, and
she and I did have a thing once.

10:10.771 --> 10:13.611
Um, you know, she taught
me about Buddhism.

10:13.641 --> 10:14.872
You're not a Buddhist.

10:14.902 --> 10:16.619
No, I'm not, but it is my favorite

10:16.649 --> 10:18.271
of all the religions.

10:19.148 --> 10:21.241
You know, not that she'll
even remember me.

10:26.856 --> 10:27.858
Hey, Bill.

10:27.888 --> 10:29.338
Maureen.

10:39.146 --> 10:41.041
Oh, my gosh.

10:41.071 --> 10:43.018
Puna's melting animal.

10:43.817 --> 10:45.616
It's like a metaphor.

10:45.797 --> 10:47.365
The end of something.

10:49.030 --> 10:50.880
What's up, honey bee?

10:51.975 --> 10:54.638
What's buzzing inside
that head of yours?

10:56.149 --> 10:58.551
Found this thing I wrote when I was 16

10:58.581 --> 11:01.352
on this hard drive that
I thought I'd lost forever.

11:01.424 --> 11:02.942
And it was...

11:03.907 --> 11:07.346
It's like a map of
how I always wanted to be.

11:08.614 --> 11:10.393
I've been too rigid.

11:11.715 --> 11:13.776
I've been too serious.

11:14.916 --> 11:17.712
I've just been a seahorse.

11:17.903 --> 11:21.579
Darlin', I already miss the seahorse.

11:27.881 --> 11:29.695
I'm Phantogram's manager.

11:29.725 --> 11:31.309
This isn't our lighting style.

11:31.339 --> 11:32.663
This isn't mystery.

11:32.693 --> 11:33.759
This isn't our look.

11:33.789 --> 11:35.008
This is a big misunderstanding.

11:35.038 --> 11:36.109
You said "huge."

11:36.139 --> 11:38.483
Yeah, I didn't mean four
towering buttresses

11:38.513 --> 11:39.448
as high as the ceiling.

11:39.478 --> 11:40.449
That's not mystery.

11:40.479 --> 11:43.451
Don't get me wrong, the words
 "Fun Co" are lit perfectly.

11:43.481 --> 11:46.100
I will clarify the situation
and get back to you.

11:46.617 --> 11:49.419
Is it true that Sia
pulled out for political reasons?

11:49.449 --> 11:51.064
We are at the forefront of all kinds

11:51.094 --> 11:53.975
of rubber-based innovations,
but Mr. Peltz violently rebuffs

11:54.005 --> 11:57.016
any notion that he condones any
actual weapons of destruction.

11:57.046 --> 11:59.320
Our business in the Middle
East is mainly recreational,

11:59.350 --> 12:01.043
and he knows the Dalai Lama.

12:05.523 --> 12:06.674
You again.

12:06.704 --> 12:08.009
Hey.

12:08.205 --> 12:11.535
So what are your thoughts
on Libya or Egypt?

12:11.593 --> 12:14.295
Or "The Imploder"?

12:14.633 --> 12:17.040
My band has a global
conscience, you know.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.414
Hey, eraser, look at me.

12:18.444 --> 12:19.688
Okay, let me tell you something, man.

12:19.718 --> 12:21.337
You keep fucking dogging
me about the Middle East,

12:21.367 --> 12:22.861
I'm gonna cut your heart out,
and I'm gonna serve it

12:22.891 --> 12:24.860
on a fucking platter like sushi, okay?

12:24.890 --> 12:26.127
Just a performer, man.

12:26.157 --> 12:27.437
Trying to make some money.

12:27.467 --> 12:28.754
Just back the fuck off.

12:28.784 --> 12:29.949
Fucking dick.

12:29.979 --> 12:31.900
I hate tall dudes.

12:32.336 --> 12:33.906
Copy that.

12:34.165 --> 12:35.704
We just got a call from Gwen Stefani.

12:35.734 --> 12:37.699
Gwen's running late due
to her son's soccer game.

12:37.729 --> 12:39.369
So you'll be going on sooner.

12:39.399 --> 12:41.577
David Spade will
introduce you, and of course,

12:41.607 --> 12:44.319
Mr. Peltz specifically requests
that you play "Janine."

12:44.349 --> 12:45.420
Christopher House is his favorite

12:45.450 --> 12:46.724
tortured singer-songwriter.

12:46.754 --> 12:48.683
He can't wait to
meet him. Is he here yet?

12:49.067 --> 12:51.192
Robin, he's expected any moment.

12:51.222 --> 12:52.154
- Shortly.
- Yeah.

12:52.184 --> 12:53.600
Mr. Peltz is thrilled that you're

12:53.630 --> 12:54.556
doing "Janine" live again.

12:54.586 --> 12:55.958
It's so exciting.

12:55.988 --> 12:58.355
- That definitely...
- Changed things.

12:59.080 --> 13:00.133
Yeah. Thanks, Robin.

13:00.163 --> 13:01.986
Good recap. Thank you.

13:22.147 --> 13:23.118
Can you hear me, sir?

13:23.148 --> 13:24.586
Yes, yes, yes.

13:24.616 --> 13:25.643
Okay.

13:25.673 --> 13:27.679
Edgar, I'm so sorry to be
calling you so late at night.

13:27.709 --> 13:29.858
Well, I can't always fall asleep

13:29.888 --> 13:31.976
when I want to these days anyway,

13:32.048 --> 13:33.762
but it's good to see you, Reg.

13:33.792 --> 13:36.799
Though, I must say,
you look a bit wrung-out.

13:36.829 --> 13:38.251
Well, yes, sir, I'm extremely concerned.

13:38.281 --> 13:39.246
See, they're breaking up.

13:39.276 --> 13:41.938
No, no, no, I can...
I can see you perfectly.

13:41.968 --> 13:44.063
No, sir, the band,
the band that hired us.

13:44.093 --> 13:46.646
They're breaking up.
-I've just found out that their manager...

13:46.676 --> 13:48.270
is determined to break them up.

13:48.300 --> 13:51.680
He's canceled the last leg
of our... of their tour.

13:51.710 --> 13:53.182
I've only just found out about this,

13:53.212 --> 13:56.891
and, sir, it is the wrong decision.

13:56.921 --> 13:59.593
Financially and in...
In... in many ways,

13:59.623 --> 14:04.218
but, sir, I can write a proposal
tonight which explains in det...

14:04.248 --> 14:06.128
No, no, no, no, Reg, there's no need.

14:06.158 --> 14:07.994
It's all been decided.

14:08.222 --> 14:09.631
You've... you've already
been reassigned.

14:09.661 --> 14:11.400
- What?
- Yes.

14:11.430 --> 14:15.276
Yes, it's a canned goods
company in need of rebranding.

14:15.306 --> 14:16.533
It's perfect for you.

14:16.563 --> 14:19.130
You'll be... you'll
be up to your ears in soup,

14:19.160 --> 14:21.893
but at least you'll
be here at home and away

14:21.923 --> 14:25.412
from what you
described in that hilarious memo,

14:25.442 --> 14:27.649
"show people who hug."

14:27.679 --> 14:30.292
Well, yes, sir,
that... That was a long time ago.

14:30.949 --> 14:32.821
- So it's over.
- Yes, Reg.

14:32.851 --> 14:35.090
Now, you mustn't let anyone over there

14:35.120 --> 14:38.265
get wind of the fact that
the tour's been called off.

14:38.368 --> 14:40.256
None of the crew must know.

14:40.422 --> 14:43.858
Preston doesn't want
any discord in the ranks.

14:43.888 --> 14:45.116
Yes, I'm sure he doesn't.

14:45.146 --> 14:47.102
Mm-hmm, yes.

14:47.132 --> 14:49.271
Well, I must say I should be relieved

14:49.301 --> 14:50.622
to have you back with us.

14:50.652 --> 14:52.610
Extantion needs you.

14:52.640 --> 14:54.141
I need you.

14:54.729 --> 14:55.677
I understand, sir.

14:55.707 --> 14:58.467
Well, if you'll forgive me,

14:58.497 --> 14:59.988
I should make another attempt at sleep.

15:00.018 --> 15:01.294
Good night.

15:01.324 --> 15:04.558
Marjorie, how do you...
How do you turn this thing off?

15:11.557 --> 15:15.464
And now, the CEO of Fun Co, Jack Peltz!

15:15.494 --> 15:19.962
Welcome, friends, to
the Fun Co experience!

15:21.500 --> 15:22.938
Can I get a "hoo!"

15:22.968 --> 15:25.607
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Fun Co!

15:25.637 --> 15:27.409
I feel a little distant from you.

15:27.439 --> 15:29.182
Should I get closer?

15:43.886 --> 15:45.852
It began with rubber vomit...

15:46.992 --> 15:48.679
Rubber roaches,

15:49.530 --> 15:51.802
and of course, the fake doggy dropping

15:51.832 --> 15:53.258
that put us on the map.

15:53.599 --> 15:55.304
But it didn't stop there.

15:55.334 --> 15:57.807
We moved from those novelty items

15:57.936 --> 16:01.938
into an exciting array of quality rubber

16:02.005 --> 16:04.660
and thermoplastic products.

16:05.184 --> 16:07.372
We don't just mold, extrude,
and fabricate

16:07.402 --> 16:09.135
rubber and polyurethanes...

16:10.118 --> 16:11.653
So do you call everybody Bill,

16:11.683 --> 16:13.021
or do you actually remember me?

16:13.051 --> 16:14.234
How could I forget?

16:14.264 --> 16:16.214
You were the cutest tour manager ever.

16:16.244 --> 16:18.132
- Come on.
- And you brought me tea.

16:18.162 --> 16:19.451
I did.

16:19.719 --> 16:21.930
You told me my voice was
great when it wasn't.

16:21.960 --> 16:24.069
Oh, I always loved your voice.

16:24.099 --> 16:27.916
That crazy room service waiter
that only spoke Latvian.

16:27.946 --> 16:29.371
That fire drill...

16:29.401 --> 16:32.034
Yeah, down that back exit.

16:32.561 --> 16:33.861
The loofah.

16:34.542 --> 16:36.369
You remember the loofah.

16:36.399 --> 16:38.220
We do it all with love.

16:38.844 --> 16:40.312
You look good, Bill.

16:40.342 --> 16:41.297
You too.

16:41.327 --> 16:42.991
I mean, you... You
look better than good.

16:43.021 --> 16:44.375
You look great.

16:44.405 --> 16:46.530
I'm glad you're not swinging
off chandeliers anymore.

16:46.560 --> 16:48.359
Me too. Me too.

16:48.533 --> 16:51.311
Now, I mean, I never
actually swung, right?

16:51.341 --> 16:52.967
- No, just a saying.
- It's just a saying, yeah.

16:52.997 --> 16:54.627
So last year, I put a little band

16:54.657 --> 16:56.249
called Guns N' Roses back together.

17:00.899 --> 17:03.338
But this year, for our 40th,

17:03.368 --> 17:08.964
we have my favorite band, Staton-House!

17:11.343 --> 17:14.488
Plus, Phantogram, Future, alt-J,

17:14.518 --> 17:16.579
Gwen Stefani, come on!

17:19.952 --> 17:25.257
And iconic fashion
entrepeneuress, Maureen Butler,

17:25.287 --> 17:29.447
unveiling her new
rubber-based creations.

17:29.477 --> 17:31.148
Why am I so nervous?

17:31.548 --> 17:33.033
You're gonna do great.

17:33.063 --> 17:34.830
This is what I do.

17:35.018 --> 17:37.091
Bring comfort to geniuses.

17:38.308 --> 17:40.286
And who brings comfort to you?

17:44.982 --> 17:47.287
Well... Hmm.

17:48.299 --> 17:49.433
All right, enough with me.

17:49.463 --> 17:51.256
Now time for the real talent.

17:51.286 --> 17:54.639
Our host, nominated for three Emmys

17:54.669 --> 17:57.529
this year as writer, creator, and star

17:57.559 --> 18:01.925
of the great drama
Dead Sex, David Spade!

18:03.607 --> 18:06.425
Whoo! Ha, ha!

18:06.455 --> 18:08.091
- Good to see you, buddy.
- Yeah.

18:10.973 --> 18:14.476
You guys, this has been
such a remarkable year,

18:14.506 --> 18:15.410
and I'm so grateful.

18:15.440 --> 18:19.707
I really appreciate all
the fans of Dead Sex out there.

18:19.737 --> 18:23.196
Wow, um, okay, thanks, thank you.

18:25.087 --> 18:27.900
So, uh,
Christopher's plane landed safely.

18:27.930 --> 18:28.957
Thank God.

18:28.987 --> 18:30.424
But he wasn't on it.

18:30.454 --> 18:31.407
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

18:31.437 --> 18:32.801
What the fuck are we supposed to do?

18:32.831 --> 18:34.047
I need you to go on sooner.

18:34.077 --> 18:36.091
I just got a call that alt-J
was stopped at the airport

18:36.121 --> 18:37.890
for not having the proper visas,
and they were sent home.

18:37.920 --> 18:39.978
-Wait, look...
-What about Gwen Stefani?

18:40.008 --> 18:41.195
She's having an emergency with her kid.

18:41.225 --> 18:42.117
She can't make it either.

18:42.147 --> 18:43.746
Oh, I've heard that one before.

18:43.776 --> 18:45.386
Wait, are you saying you think
it might not be true?

18:45.416 --> 18:46.408
Because that's what I thought.

18:46.438 --> 18:47.815
Oh, of course it's true.

18:47.845 --> 18:49.596
Why would Gwen Stefani
not want to be here?

18:49.626 --> 18:50.725
What am I gonna do?

18:50.755 --> 18:52.934
This is the 40th anniversary of Fun Co.

18:52.964 --> 18:55.816

Future, and Phantogram.

In just a few weeks, it's gonna be

21:49.060 --> 21:52.601
you and me destroying Europe together.

21:54.855 --> 21:56.158
No.

21:56.308 --> 21:58.292
Mom says I'm not allowed to go on tour

21:58.322 --> 21:59.689
with my dad anymore.

22:00.960 --> 22:02.010
Wait, what?

22:02.040 --> 22:04.181
They got in this whole fight,

22:04.211 --> 22:06.054
and she won.

22:06.508 --> 22:10.154
So ... looks like we only have today,

22:10.618 --> 22:14.781
tomorrow, one last show, and good-bye.

22:29.628 --> 22:33.418
Now, on the way down here, I
stopped at the 99 cent store.

22:33.448 --> 22:35.632
I usually don't go in
there because I'm rich,

22:35.662 --> 22:40.380
but ... I'm on hiatus, so I stopped in.

22:40.410 --> 22:42.438
A lot of things in the 99 cent store.

22:42.468 --> 22:45.320
Weirdest thing was
the early pregnancy test.

22:45.684 --> 22:47.744
This is for the girl
in the regular pharmacy

22:47.774 --> 22:48.740
going, "I think I'm pregnant,

22:48.770 --> 22:51.483
but I'm not spending more
than a buck to find out.

22:52.074 --> 22:53.184
I'll just wait."

22:53.214 --> 22:55.020
You guys, thanks.
That's my part.

22:57.449 --> 22:58.708
You're very nice people.

22:58.738 --> 23:00.020
We've got a great show tonight.

23:00.050 --> 23:02.315
Your headliners are coming up right now.

23:02.731 --> 23:05.570
It's an honor to bring up
this great American band.

23:05.600 --> 23:09.074
You know... one second ...  please.

23:09.104 --> 23:10.424
I love your work, by the way.

23:10.454 --> 23:11.281
Thank you.

23:11.311 --> 23:12.597
Just...

23:17.957 --> 23:19.093
Is this real?

23:19.123 --> 23:20.675
Okay.

23:21.448 --> 23:22.794
All right.

23:23.100 --> 23:27.001
Ladies and gentlemen,
most of Staton-House!

23:35.456 --> 23:37.364
Hey, Fun Co.

23:40.244 --> 23:42.339
After conferring with Mr. Peltz,

23:42.369 --> 23:45.015
we've determined we will only
be paying you the guarantee.

23:45.045 --> 23:46.631
Let's pretend you never said that,

23:46.661 --> 23:47.645
and let me talk to Mr. Peltz.

23:47.675 --> 23:50.123
I'm sorry. That is not an option.

23:50.153 --> 23:51.263
How may I help, Robin?

23:51.293 --> 23:52.269
You can't help.

23:52.299 --> 23:53.523
You didn't provide a full band,

23:53.553 --> 23:54.835
therefore, we won't be
paying you in full.

23:54.865 --> 23:58.154
Now, now, Robin,
I... we put 4/5 of this band

23:58.184 --> 23:59.379
up on that stage.

23:59.409 --> 24:01.588
So you'll pay us 4/5 of your contract.

24:01.618 --> 24:03.064
Exactly. Well said.

24:03.094 --> 24:04.264
She's right.

24:04.294 --> 24:06.218
I cannot deal with this right now.

24:06.345 --> 24:08.796
Robin, you're doing a great job.

24:09.438 --> 24:11.245
Is there any word from Christopher yet?

24:11.275 --> 24:12.792
I mean, I don't fucking understand.

24:12.822 --> 24:14.307
I'm texting him this morning.

24:14.337 --> 24:16.357
He said the plane was about to take off.

24:16.387 --> 24:18.516
Well, it did, just not with him.

24:23.666 --> 24:25.368
Why are you looking at me like that?

24:25.398 --> 24:26.458
Like what?

24:26.488 --> 24:27.728
Never mind.

24:27.758 --> 24:31.265
Uh, what exactly did that
text from Christopher say?

24:31.295 --> 24:32.619
Just read it to me.

24:34.883 --> 24:36.333
"All's well.

24:36.705 --> 24:38.400
I'm finding my way back."

24:38.534 --> 24:39.835
Wait.

24:39.909 --> 24:41.999
"I'm finding my way back"

24:42.029 --> 24:43.864
is a line from "November Girl."

24:43.894 --> 24:44.854
Janine.

24:44.884 --> 24:45.994
Janine.

24:46.024 --> 24:47.908
He's with Janine.

25:01.061 --> 25:02.452
Look, there he is.

25:02.940 --> 25:04.370
What do you think?

25:06.674 --> 25:09.269
He looks like Steve Buscemi.

25:10.505 --> 25:11.825
I know.

25:12.678 --> 25:14.531
I've got to pluck up the courage.

25:15.267 --> 25:17.652
Could I have another Pino Palladino?

25:17.682 --> 25:19.928
- You mean a piña colada?
- Yeah, sorry.

25:19.958 --> 25:22.181
I got it mixed up with
the bassist from The Who.

25:22.923 --> 25:24.382
Okay, this is sick.

25:24.412 --> 25:27.200
There's a big exec at Fun
Co named Mr. Wesley.

25:27.230 --> 25:29.024
They accidentally gave me his suite.

25:29.054 --> 25:30.174
They're gonna regret that.

25:30.204 --> 25:31.510
Yeah.

25:32.777 --> 25:34.756
Holy shit. You're drinking?

25:34.825 --> 25:36.381
I mean, I haven't
seen you drink all tour.

25:36.411 --> 25:37.557
Is this 'cause of Christopher?

25:37.587 --> 25:38.650
'Cause I heard it's just strep throat.

25:38.680 --> 25:40.525
No, this is me being the real me.

25:40.555 --> 25:42.746
I begged her to take it slow.

25:44.371 --> 25:46.384
Okay, Kel, you know what,
I don't like you drinking.

25:46.414 --> 25:47.749
It never ends well.

25:47.779 --> 25:49.389
That was the past.

25:49.419 --> 25:51.595
Tonight, I change all that.

25:52.164 --> 25:53.345
Okay, just...

25:53.375 --> 25:54.321
You know what?

25:54.351 --> 25:55.753
Just meet me in my room
later tonight, okay,

25:55.783 --> 25:56.690
so I can keep an eye on you.

25:56.720 --> 25:58.790
I'm throwing a party to network.

25:58.820 --> 26:00.887
To network? Why?

26:00.961 --> 26:02.093
To seek employment, man.

26:02.123 --> 26:03.865
You know, Winston's
not allowed to go on tour

26:03.895 --> 26:04.759
with his dad anymore,

26:04.789 --> 26:07.921
so I guess I won't be going
with you all to Europe.

26:07.951 --> 26:09.089
Aw, Wes.

26:09.119 --> 26:10.914
It's fine. It's fine, okay?

26:10.944 --> 26:13.569
I know exactly how to create
business opportunities.

26:14.853 --> 26:16.310
I'm gonna get hooked up with a new tour

26:16.340 --> 26:18.665
before the night's over, mark my words.

26:27.776 --> 26:29.411
I don't understand.

26:29.801 --> 26:32.654
Okay, uh, Natalie, look.

26:32.684 --> 26:37.493
Rick is a difficult,
changeable, selfish,

26:37.523 --> 26:39.158
extremely friendly guy.

26:39.188 --> 26:40.236
I know.

26:40.266 --> 26:41.382
Of course you do.

26:41.412 --> 26:42.540
Great.

26:42.570 --> 26:43.564
So we're good.

26:43.594 --> 26:45.100
We're just good.

26:45.130 --> 26:47.199
- No, no, we're not.
- Okay.

26:47.229 --> 26:50.375
'Cause you are threatened
by the influence

26:50.405 --> 26:52.127
I have over him.

26:52.157 --> 26:56.200
That is true, but this comes from Rick.

26:56.577 --> 26:57.894
Not me.

26:58.372 --> 27:00.514
Look at me. Rick does not want you here.

27:00.961 --> 27:03.079
And I believe you now.

27:03.495 --> 27:05.415
But I'm still not going.

27:05.940 --> 27:07.637
You really thought I would leave?

27:07.667 --> 27:08.790
Are you kidding?

27:08.820 --> 27:11.745
People are going to tell
my story to their children

27:11.775 --> 27:13.855
to inspire them.

27:14.555 --> 27:16.282
The little fangirl that could.

27:16.312 --> 27:18.492
Please, you have to go.

27:18.522 --> 27:22.051
And it's an uplifting tale of
redemption and transformation.

27:22.081 --> 27:23.342
Think about it.

27:23.372 --> 27:26.706
Was I really just
this crazy, obsessed fan,

27:26.736 --> 27:29.760
or did I somehow have this inner knowing

27:29.790 --> 27:34.011
that this band was ... where I belonged?

27:34.800 --> 27:36.315
Just like Phil's story.

27:36.707 --> 27:38.041
Which one?

27:38.550 --> 27:40.315
N-never mind.

27:42.839 --> 27:44.265
Natalie, look.

27:45.681 --> 27:47.122
Where will you sleep?

27:52.370 --> 27:54.162
Take this, okay?

27:57.492 --> 27:58.947
It gets cold here at night.

28:01.281 --> 28:03.071
Rick's just afraid of commitment,

28:03.101 --> 28:04.850
like all human beings, you know?

28:06.038 --> 28:08.808
Yeah, I heard that.

28:10.957 --> 28:12.447
He'll come around.

28:19.432 --> 28:21.582
Reg, you are a sight for sore...

28:21.612 --> 28:22.923
Wow.

28:25.897 --> 28:27.173
Great.

28:31.682 --> 28:33.535
Europe's gonna be awesome.

28:39.563 --> 28:41.872
Mr. Peltz, I'm Reg Whitehead.
I've just heard.

28:41.902 --> 28:45.113
I sincerely apologize for
the lack of Christopher House.

28:45.143 --> 28:46.938
Man, I am not happy.

28:46.968 --> 28:49.628
And, look, I'm known for being happy.

28:49.658 --> 28:52.931
I spend 36 hours a day ...  happy.

28:52.961 --> 28:54.309
The...

28:54.834 --> 28:58.282
If I may, there's only...
There's only 24 hours in a day.

28:58.312 --> 28:59.901
You didn't read my business bestseller,

28:59.931 --> 29:01.175
When the Road Meets the Rubber?

29:01.205 --> 29:02.920
No, I have. I've read it, yeah.

29:02.950 --> 29:05.030
In the last chapter, I talked
about the 36-hour day, so...

29:05.060 --> 29:07.043
It's entitled "The 36-Hour Day."

29:07.073 --> 29:08.074
That's the heading of the chapter.

29:08.104 --> 29:10.095
- That's right.
- How could I forget?

29:10.159 --> 29:11.583
So yeah, this is on me.

29:11.613 --> 29:15.629
Um, I- I allowed a situation to unfold

29:15.659 --> 29:18.254
which caused Christopher
a great deal of shock

29:18.284 --> 29:20.174
and emotional turmoil.

29:20.204 --> 29:22.690
That's... that's... that's why...
That's why he isn't here.

29:22.720 --> 29:24.544
That's the reason he isn't here.
-It's 'cause of me.

29:25.517 --> 29:28.267
I've just... I've just long
been an admirer of you

29:28.297 --> 29:31.715
and your, um, business instincts,

29:31.745 --> 29:35.712
and I just... I just feel
compelled to tell you the truth.

29:36.417 --> 29:38.345
Well, thank you for that, Reg.

29:38.866 --> 29:40.900
But if you'd like some advice,

29:41.261 --> 29:43.017
unless you like failure,

29:43.047 --> 29:46.231
you need to embrace the selective truth.

29:50.155 --> 29:52.913
I've told the
selective truth my entire life.

29:55.042 --> 29:57.128
And I cannot do it anymore.

29:58.239 --> 30:00.117
Do you want to hear the actual truth?

30:00.572 --> 30:02.788
It's literally just come
to me in this moment now.

30:04.969 --> 30:07.531
I reject your business philosophies

30:08.667 --> 30:10.833
and everything that you stand for.

30:11.092 --> 30:14.636
Because you see, Peltz,
your father was right.

30:16.901 --> 30:18.582
The key isn't the pencil.

30:19.130 --> 30:20.997
The key is the eraser.

30:23.600 --> 30:25.980
The key to life is the second chance.

30:32.529 --> 30:33.882
What do you mean, a second ago,

30:33.912 --> 30:35.179
"emotional turmoil"?

30:35.209 --> 30:36.959
What emotional turmoil?

30:36.989 --> 30:40.941
Um, I... Someone I met...

30:43.357 --> 30:44.630
Called Janine.

30:44.660 --> 30:45.534
Janine?

30:45.564 --> 30:46.589
Yeah.

30:46.619 --> 30:47.584
Not the Janine?

30:47.614 --> 30:49.009
Janine.

30:49.417 --> 30:52.072
You know her? You know Janine?

30:52.102 --> 30:53.219
I know her.

30:53.249 --> 30:55.421
I-I have to hear this.

30:55.649 --> 30:59.453
Th... this is... this is better
than hearing the fucking song.

30:59.599 --> 31:00.616
Can I buy you a drink?

31:00.646 --> 31:02.925
Yeah, yeah. It's good...
-No, no, not that shit, the good stuff.

31:02.955 --> 31:04.122
Fuck that, yeah.

31:04.152 --> 31:05.482
King of Phantogram.

31:05.512 --> 31:08.306
Wes, you seem like the go-to guy.

31:08.336 --> 31:10.204
Dude, I am your
go-to guy for everything.

31:10.234 --> 31:11.318
Well, I got an idea.

31:11.348 --> 31:14.140
How about we Postmates some
Hooters buffalo wings, you know?

31:14.170 --> 31:15.713
-Yes.
-Extra crispy.

31:15.743 --> 31:17.892
Done. I got you, dog.

31:18.942 --> 31:20.106
Donna!

31:20.136 --> 31:21.416
Wes Coast!

31:21.446 --> 31:23.473
Hey, real quick,

31:23.503 --> 31:27.749
I'm available all year for employment.

31:28.770 --> 31:30.654
Guitars, people, and coffee.

31:30.684 --> 31:33.181
So here I am, doing teleprompter
for Staton-House,

31:33.211 --> 31:34.898
and you're doing the
video for Phantogram,

31:34.928 --> 31:36.922
and you're sat right opposite me,

31:36.952 --> 31:39.187
and we're hanging in this
bar, and we use real life.

31:39.217 --> 31:42.162
We didn't use Tinder
or Blender or Binder.

31:42.192 --> 31:44.270
We used real life.

31:44.678 --> 31:46.070
And we both hate corporate gigs.

31:46.100 --> 31:49.681
Well, I actually kind
of love corporate gigs.

31:49.711 --> 31:51.750
We did one for Gillette,
and I took, like,

31:51.780 --> 31:53.324
ten bags of razors.

31:53.354 --> 31:54.413
Yeah.

31:54.443 --> 31:56.280
But don't you think they're kind of...

31:56.310 --> 31:58.683
These events are like a ... sellout.

31:58.713 --> 32:00.018
Why?

32:00.497 --> 32:02.810
The whole old school vibe is dead.

32:03.304 --> 32:05.191
People don't even clap anymore
'cause they've got

32:05.221 --> 32:06.714
a phone in one hand.

32:06.744 --> 32:08.110
Wake up.

32:08.140 --> 32:11.367
We're just here to steal a few watches

32:11.397 --> 32:14.150
off of the ... rotting carcass

32:14.180 --> 32:16.566
of what used to be alternative music.

32:16.596 --> 32:18.854
I disagree. It's just a travesty.

32:18.884 --> 32:20.459
It's like an invisible
gas that surrounds you,

32:20.489 --> 32:22.736
and then one day, you're just
another fucking sellout.

32:22.766 --> 32:25.460
Okay, yeah, you're being anachronistic.

32:25.490 --> 32:27.122
"Anachronistic"?

32:27.232 --> 32:28.207
Do you even know what that means?

32:28.237 --> 32:30.155
You're... you're
calling me a relic out of time,

32:30.185 --> 32:32.016
and all I'm saying is that
I really care about music,

32:32.046 --> 32:33.414
and that matters more than ever.

32:33.444 --> 32:34.818
It's not something that can be bought.

32:34.848 --> 32:37.258
It's not something that you can contain

32:37.288 --> 32:39.510
in a rubber billionaire's rubber palace.

32:39.540 --> 32:42.133
You're dreaming if you
don't realize that it's

32:42.163 --> 32:43.594
all different now.

32:43.698 --> 32:45.812
You know, you have a beautiful smile.

32:45.842 --> 32:49.793
You should... use it more.

32:52.974 --> 32:54.725
Do you want to get out of here?

32:57.212 --> 32:58.546
Yeah.

32:58.800 --> 33:00.123
I do.

33:00.879 --> 33:02.221
Alone.

33:09.894 --> 33:11.618
So quick as that,

33:11.648 --> 33:14.537
everything, like, came into focus.

33:14.567 --> 33:16.267
There she is.

33:16.297 --> 33:18.249
Aww, hey, baby.

33:18.279 --> 33:19.276
Good job.

33:19.306 --> 33:20.505
I'm having a great time. How 'bout you?

33:20.535 --> 33:21.985
I'm having a wonderful time.

33:22.015 --> 33:25.648
This is my luminous,
effervescent fiancée, Maureen.

33:25.678 --> 33:28.001
Hi, Maureen. I'm Reginald.

33:41.733 --> 33:42.765
Hello.

33:42.795 --> 33:44.156
Heyo.

33:47.062 --> 33:48.390
You know, um,

33:48.420 --> 33:50.706
what I said to you before,
I shouldn't have,

33:50.736 --> 33:53.081
and I... I just... I apologize.

33:53.111 --> 33:54.422
It...

33:54.504 --> 33:56.073
We all make mistakes.

33:56.103 --> 33:57.430
I've been...

33:57.891 --> 33:59.330
Making one all night.

33:59.360 --> 34:01.289
Yeah.
-I'm Logan.

34:02.410 --> 34:03.660
I'm, uh... I'm Milo.

34:03.690 --> 34:05.838
Hey, Milo.
-Hey. Nice to meet you.

34:05.868 --> 34:07.046
You too.

34:09.009 --> 34:10.062
So guess what.

34:10.092 --> 34:11.387
What?

34:12.114 --> 34:13.815
We both have suits.

34:16.154 --> 34:17.661
- Yep.
- Yeah.

34:18.505 --> 34:19.514
And guess what else.

34:19.543 --> 34:20.869
What else?

34:22.980 --> 34:24.531
I can see the future.

34:24.705 --> 34:26.594
- Wow.
- Yeah.

34:27.205 --> 34:29.431
Well, do you want to know what happens?

34:29.652 --> 34:30.998
Mm-hmm.

34:32.781 --> 34:37.751
We come back here ...  to this ... very seat...

34:40.775 --> 34:42.994
to remember the moment we first met.

34:49.237 --> 34:51.114
When do you want the future to begin?

34:52.795 --> 34:56.168
Must've been odd
being up there minus one.

34:56.880 --> 34:59.894
Actually, it was fine.

35:00.316 --> 35:01.627
Hmm.

35:03.824 --> 35:06.254
Here's... Here's
what I want to say, uh...

35:06.505 --> 35:09.857
I've given your
generous offer a ton of thought,

35:09.887 --> 35:13.884
and with all respect,
I have to tell you, uh,

35:14.323 --> 35:16.682
you're wrong about Bill.

35:18.660 --> 35:22.528
He cares about this band so much.

35:22.897 --> 35:25.752
In fact, no one cares
more about this band

35:25.782 --> 35:27.082
than Bill does.

35:27.112 --> 35:29.513
So I'd really love to manage you guys,

35:29.543 --> 35:33.600
but, um! ... I won't do it without him.

35:35.634 --> 35:38.004
He makes me better. I know it.

35:39.485 --> 35:42.353
Together, we can give you everything.

35:43.050 --> 35:45.148
My heart is with this band.

35:45.704 --> 35:47.117
So is his.

35:47.720 --> 35:51.708
So ...  I'm not saying take it or leave it.

35:52.107 --> 35:54.899
I'm saying ... take it.

36:01.268 --> 36:02.308
What are you... What are you doing?

36:02.338 --> 36:03.731
What are you looking for?

36:03.928 --> 36:05.481
I lost my hard drive.

36:05.511 --> 36:06.771
It must've fallen out of my pocket.

36:06.801 --> 36:07.604
Oh.

36:07.634 --> 36:08.939
Listen...Um.

36:08.969 --> 36:11.223
You know Wes really wants
to come to Europe,

36:11.253 --> 36:13.465
and he's a really great tech,
and you've had his coffee,

36:13.495 --> 36:15.313
so can... could you just...

36:15.343 --> 36:16.577
What?

36:16.607 --> 36:17.614
I'm sorry, I can't...

36:17.644 --> 36:19.209
You don't have to promise anything.

36:19.239 --> 36:20.540
I d...

36:22.990 --> 36:24.403
Okay.

36:24.623 --> 36:25.423
Just forget it.

36:25.453 --> 36:26.589
By the way, your nickname

36:26.619 --> 36:28.832
doesn't stand for Due Diligence.

36:28.862 --> 36:30.977
It stands for Douchebag Dawson.

36:33.032 --> 36:34.455
Wait a second.
That's a terrible nickname.

36:34.485 --> 36:36.705
Doesn't even...
doesn't even fucking make sense,

36:36.735 --> 36:38.824
apart from the douchebag bit.

36:38.903 --> 36:42.010
Who's, um... What's... who's Dawson?

36:42.040 --> 36:43.795
It's a reference to Titanic.

36:43.825 --> 36:45.262
- I've never seen it.
- What?

36:45.292 --> 36:46.946
I've never seen Titanic.

36:47.283 --> 36:49.173
I'm never... I'm never going to...

36:49.208 --> 36:50.068
Never gonna watch it.

36:50.098 --> 36:51.714
What we'll do is, is us two,

36:51.744 --> 36:53.183
we'll go and find it together.

36:54.104 --> 36:55.418
Yeah?

36:57.451 --> 36:58.436
Okay.

36:58.466 --> 36:59.842
Yeah.

37:01.008 --> 37:02.264
Never seen Titanic.

37:02.294 --> 37:04.021
No, I've never seen Titanic.

37:12.851 --> 37:15.039
You know, uh, a little bird told me

37:15.069 --> 37:17.017
you're the best road manager in music.

37:17.047 --> 37:18.641
And in space.

37:18.671 --> 37:22.780
If it's stories you want,
I got a lot of 'em.

37:23.399 --> 37:25.546
But only if you pay the balance.

37:25.821 --> 37:27.194
Hmm.

37:27.253 --> 37:28.450
Okay.

37:28.480 --> 37:31.558
A grand per story, take it or leave it.

37:31.588 --> 37:34.827
Just call me
Schehera-fuckin'-zade.

37:36.013 --> 37:37.256
What's your, uh...

37:37.286 --> 37:39.480
What's your favorite song, all-time?

37:40.145 --> 37:42.509
My all-time favorite song

37:42.808 --> 37:47.384
is an obscure little treasure
called "Willin'" by Little Feat.

37:47.414 --> 37:49.792
All right, well, next year,
I'll have it sung for you,

37:49.822 --> 37:52.080
and you'll be guest of honor.

37:53.199 --> 37:54.773
Yeah, Tom Petty did it too,

37:54.803 --> 37:57.110
and so did that
lovely little Linda Ronstadt,

37:57.140 --> 38:01.125
but my favorite version,
the definitive version ...

38:02.277 --> 38:04.395
was by the late Lowell George.

38:05.464 --> 38:07.789
I'm sorry. I'm a
little emotional tonight.

38:07.819 --> 38:08.798
No, it's all right. It's all right.

38:08.828 --> 38:10.139
I love it.

38:10.714 --> 38:11.692
I'll show you around.

38:11.722 --> 38:14.039
I've got, uh, Roger Waters'
Telecaster over here.

38:14.069 --> 38:14.917
Well, don't show it to me.

38:14.947 --> 38:16.066
I'll tell you if it's real.

38:16.096 --> 38:18.149
He lived with me for three months.

38:24.406 --> 38:25.541
Can I grab a plate?

38:25.571 --> 38:26.775
Yeah, sure.

38:26.805 --> 38:28.140
Thank you.

38:29.350 --> 38:31.275
David Spade?
-Hey, hey.

38:31.305 --> 38:34.428
Man, I'm a huge fan, I mean, huge fan.

38:34.458 --> 38:36.172
Bill Hanson, Staton-House Band.

38:36.202 --> 38:38.136
All right. Oh, cool, cool.
-Yeah, yeah.

38:38.275 --> 38:41.773
Gosh, I just got to tell
you, you look good.

38:41.803 --> 38:44.314
I really admire the way
you've incorporated

38:44.344 --> 38:48.115
your success into
kind of a charismatic ease.

38:48.145 --> 38:49.970
Yeah, it comes very naturally to you.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.351
Well, that was the plan.

38:51.381 --> 38:52.547
Yeah.

38:52.577 --> 38:54.113
Sorry, man, I'm...

38:54.143 --> 38:56.465
Really, I have to ask you this,

38:56.495 --> 38:57.870
but how does the season end?

38:57.900 --> 38:59.785
I mean, do you find Jen?

39:00.106 --> 39:02.427
Eh, I probably shouldn't tell you.

39:02.866 --> 39:03.956
You want to know?

39:03.986 --> 39:05.882
No, you know what, you're right.

39:05.912 --> 39:07.232
I don't. You're right.

39:07.262 --> 39:08.717
Sorry, excuse me.

39:09.859 --> 39:11.471
Man, I'm s...

39:11.971 --> 39:13.771
You're right here. I do, I do.

39:13.801 --> 39:15.189
I got to know.

39:15.219 --> 39:17.118
Just between you and me.

39:17.771 --> 39:19.101
All right.

39:19.188 --> 39:20.744
I kill Jen.

39:22.828 --> 39:24.600
You kill Jen?

39:25.848 --> 39:27.831

On your little hard drive?

40:59.007 --> 41:01.111
Just all this stuff
that I wrote when I was 16

41:01.141 --> 41:04.465
about wanting to be
strong and courageous

41:04.495 --> 41:06.188
and just not giving a shit.

41:06.218 --> 41:07.640
But... that's who you are.

41:08.507 --> 41:09.615
That's the person that you are.

41:09.645 --> 41:11.239
- No.
- Yeah.

41:13.288 --> 41:15.210
No, I've been...

41:16.539 --> 41:20.204
somewhat... lost.

41:20.234 --> 41:23.030
Yeah, we're all lost,
but you... but, um...

41:23.060 --> 41:24.466
Right, so you stood up to me.

41:24.496 --> 41:26.144
You do have courage.

41:26.669 --> 41:28.317
You are those things.

41:28.347 --> 41:30.193
And everybody sees it.

41:30.703 --> 41:32.886
Everybody sees this, um...

41:33.825 --> 41:35.130
this light...

41:36.227 --> 41:37.663
that you have in you.

41:41.633 --> 41:43.034
And I think that

41:43.809 --> 41:45.669
one day, you will see it too.

41:49.358 --> 41:50.487
Can we stop looking for it now?

41:50.517 --> 41:51.676
- And do what?
- I don't know.

41:51.706 --> 41:53.697
We could watch a movie.

41:55.638 --> 41:57.790
Or we could... Do you know they made

41:57.820 --> 42:00.679
the film I Like It Hot just over there?

42:01.798 --> 42:02.792
- Some Like It Hot.
- Some Like It Hot.

42:02.822 --> 42:04.252
Just over there.

42:05.244 --> 42:07.110
- Yes, Billy Wilder movie.
- Wilder movie.

42:07.140 --> 42:09.054
And he also made Sunset Boulevard.

42:09.084 --> 42:12.032
Boulevard, and, uh... Uh...

42:12.062 --> 42:13.932
Yeah, he's a... I mean, he's a...

42:13.962 --> 42:15.742
He's a great...

42:17.220 --> 42:19.790
I don't... I don't
want to watch a movie.

42:19.820 --> 42:21.735
Well, then, we could swim.

42:23.765 --> 42:27.147
Drunkenly, in the nude...

42:27.295 --> 42:31.435
And ... celebrate the destruction

42:31.465 --> 42:33.863
of who we are ... or were.

42:33.893 --> 42:36.312
- Reg...
- Fuck it. Call me Double D.

42:38.786 --> 42:40.136
Double D.

42:40.317 --> 42:41.619
Yes?

42:45.869 --> 42:48.440
I've only ever had sex drunk.

42:50.570 --> 42:52.792
I've never had it not drunk.

42:55.270 --> 42:57.708
And I...

42:59.085 --> 43:00.762
would really like...

43:02.206 --> 43:04.175
to try that sometime.

43:06.380 --> 43:07.749
In Europe,

43:08.821 --> 43:10.629
maybe with you.

43:12.724 --> 43:14.038
Oh.

43:17.843 --> 43:19.131
So...

43:23.054 --> 43:24.474
Can I kiss you?

43:26.379 --> 43:27.720
Stateside?

43:30.003 --> 43:31.458
Like when?

43:48.205 --> 43:50.003
Wait, Reg, do you understand

43:50.033 --> 43:52.204
what I mean about waiting until Europe?

43:52.234 --> 43:53.579
I do. I do.

43:58.520 --> 44:00.325
Except there is no Europe.

44:02.341 --> 44:04.340
That's not funny.

44:04.936 --> 44:06.911
I'm sorry. I shouldn't make jokes.

44:08.186 --> 44:10.165
Were you just saying that
to try and get me into bed?

44:10.195 --> 44:12.146
Yeah, I did.

44:12.210 --> 44:14.203
Forgive me. Okay.

44:14.233 --> 44:18.655
Well, well, we'll
wait until... Until Europe...

44:31.464 --> 44:32.924
Marilyn Monroe, she always looks like

44:32.954 --> 44:36.452
her clothes are just about to fall off.

44:37.500 --> 44:41.328
She's always laughing, but
you can tell how sad she is.

44:41.713 --> 44:43.864
And she wants to, um,

44:44.506 --> 44:46.429
marry someone very rich,
and I always thought

44:46.459 --> 44:48.170
that was such a smart idea.

44:49.351 --> 44:51.669
And I wanted to be that rich man
that she would want to marry.

44:51.699 --> 44:53.430
Good night, Sugar.

44:56.724 --> 44:58.449
Good night, honey.

44:59.799 --> 45:03.107
Honey? She called me honey.

45:07.359 --> 45:09.257
I'm gonna find your hard drive.

45:10.690 --> 45:12.431
I'm gonna go and get it.

45:33.366 --> 45:34.742
Thank you.

45:37.003 --> 45:38.341
No, I understand.

45:38.371 --> 45:40.597
No, but listen to me.

45:40.627 --> 45:41.978
These people are huge Dead Sex fans.

45:42.008 --> 45:43.651
Do you get it?

45:43.681 --> 45:46.393
Now, do we have time to rewrite
and re-shoot the ending?

45:46.423 --> 45:47.650
Let's get Aaron Sorkin for a day

45:47.680 --> 45:49.151
or that guy that did Hamilton.

45:49.181 --> 45:51.229
I'm not shitting you. We have to do it.

45:51.259 --> 45:52.894
I'll pay for it myself.

45:52.924 --> 45:56.208
The forum is such a
logistical nightmare.

45:56.951 --> 45:59.529
Do you ever dream about
delegating this menial crap

45:59.559 --> 46:00.558
when we're managers?

46:00.588 --> 46:01.874
Only most days.

46:01.904 --> 46:03.194
Dream no more.

46:03.224 --> 46:05.203
Tom wants us to take over.

46:06.302 --> 46:07.410
You messin' with me?

46:07.440 --> 46:08.965
He approached me, you and me.

46:08.995 --> 46:10.041
The time is now.

46:10.071 --> 46:11.356
What do you say, partner?

46:11.386 --> 46:12.535
I can't.

46:12.565 --> 46:14.854
I can't manage the band with you.

46:15.910 --> 46:17.222
Why not?

46:23.036 --> 46:25.209
Because I'm in love with you.

46:26.099 --> 46:27.433
Oh.

46:28.281 --> 46:29.392
Don't worry.

46:29.422 --> 46:31.064
I mean, you don't have to say anything.

46:31.094 --> 46:32.960
-I don't?
-No.

46:32.990 --> 46:35.104
I mean, I could tell from...

46:36.230 --> 46:37.913
When I first saw you this morning

46:37.943 --> 46:40.113
and I could see how happy you were,

46:40.143 --> 46:42.753
I knew that you and I were over.

46:42.783 --> 46:44.208
What are you talking about?

46:44.238 --> 46:46.209
I'm saying you went home,

46:46.726 --> 46:48.610
and that broke the spell.

46:48.674 --> 46:51.134
I-I was happy to be back.

46:51.164 --> 46:52.955
I-I-I was sad to leave,

46:52.985 --> 46:55.804
and really happy to come back.

46:55.834 --> 46:57.814
-Really?
-Yeah.

46:57.988 --> 47:00.463
I mean, you don't have to just say that.

47:03.223 --> 47:04.818
Hey, guys?

47:04.848 --> 47:06.192
Yeah.

47:06.948 --> 47:08.664
I just got this.

47:09.281 --> 47:10.829
What is it?

47:12.036 --> 47:14.042
"As Neil Young once said,

47:14.481 --> 47:18.368
some things that started
spontaneously 14 years ago

47:18.510 --> 47:19.887
end that way.

47:20.560 --> 47:22.230
Long may you run."

47:23.739 --> 47:25.810
"Christopher House."

47:27.653 --> 47:29.269
He's left the band.

47:32.163 --> 47:34.642
-You okay?
-I don't know.

47:35.915 --> 47:37.390
We'll see.

47:43.845 --> 47:45.276
Hey, Reginald.

47:45.306 --> 47:47.040
Oh, Phil!

47:49.397 --> 47:50.500
Hey, listen, man.

47:50.530 --> 47:52.053
You need to hear this.

47:52.921 --> 47:55.167
Peltz told me you blame
yourself for this,

47:55.197 --> 47:56.117
and that's bullshit.

47:56.147 --> 47:57.476
Phil...

47:59.485 --> 48:01.196
I haven't given up hope.

48:02.799 --> 48:04.749
I can still save this tour.

48:06.079 --> 48:07.840
Nothing you can do.

48:08.139 --> 48:09.680
It's already over.

48:09.970 --> 48:13.669
All because those two boys
couldn't talk to each other.

48:16.499 --> 48:17.900
People.

48:19.214 --> 48:20.550
People.

48:21.567 --> 48:23.700
Only thing worse than people

48:23.750 --> 48:25.074
is monkeys.

48:27.271 --> 48:30.195
I don't really have much
of an opinion on monkeys.

48:33.735 --> 48:36.603
Listen ... listen.

48:41.680 --> 48:43.100
Do you hear that?

48:46.625 --> 48:48.381
No, I don't hear a thing.

48:54.796 --> 48:55.938
Fuck, Phil.

48:55.968 --> 48:57.413
Fuck. Phil.

48:57.443 --> 48:59.521
Can somebody please help us?

48:59.551 --> 49:01.812
Phil? Phil.

49:38.322 --> 49:40.592
The paramedics are on their way.
