02:11.875 --> 02:12.547
Brooke.

02:23.115 --> 02:24.604
- Peyton.
- Hey.

02:25.408 --> 02:26.191
What’s the latest?

02:26.264 --> 02:30.944
Boy dates girl, girl doesn’t know what she wants, boy starts dating girl’s best friend, girl ruins everything.

02:31.061 --> 02:33.171
Dark, anything I can do?

02:33.217 --> 02:34.973
No, story pretty much ends there.

02:35.474 --> 02:37.369
- You look like hell.
- Thanks.

02:37.440 --> 02:39.499
Only have been working on about two hours of sleep.

02:39.657 --> 02:43.684
I don’t know what it was, but Jenny, just would not stop crying last night.

02:43.735 --> 02:44.649
You try the key thing?

02:44.710 --> 02:47.900
Yeah, yeah I tried that, but as soon as I’d stop she’d start up again.

02:48.521 --> 02:50.918
Try a shot of whisky? Always works for me.

02:53.877 --> 02:57.282
So hey, listen. My cousin’s getting married downtown this weekend.

02:57.720 --> 03:01.048
Is there any chance that you could watch Jenny for a few hours?

03:01.269 --> 03:02.677
You’d really be helping me out.

03:02.846 --> 03:04.029
What’s the pay?

03:04.387 --> 03:07.299
An entire night away from all this drama that you got going on.

03:09.527 --> 03:11.918
Okay. You got yourself a sitter.

03:12.046 --> 03:12.646
Yeah?

03:14.668 --> 03:15.600
Thank you.

03:19.954 --> 03:22.620
So, what’s your mother got planned for you two this weekend?

03:23.042 --> 03:24.616
As little as possible I hope.

03:24.812 --> 03:25.845
Sit. Eat.

03:26.176 --> 03:30.474
Dad, I can’t, I gotta go. I haven’t made it to school on time once since I moved out here.

03:31.010 --> 03:32.173
Well, you will now.

03:38.071 --> 03:41.247
Five speed mustang, fully loaded, and she’s all yours.

03:44.511 --> 03:46.478
I know this divorce has been hard on you, Nate.

03:47.243 --> 03:49.535
Just wanted to thank you for sticking by the old man.

03:52.003 --> 03:52.941
What’s the matter?

03:54.077 --> 03:56.156
You’re not supposed to look the gift horse in the mouth, you know.

03:56.243 --> 03:58.956
It’s not a gift, Dad. This is a bribe.

03:59.059 --> 04:03.027
A bribe. Wow. Not exactly the thank you I was expecting.

04:03.073 --> 04:04.624
Okay, thanks for the car, Dad.

04:04.942 --> 04:06.909
Now I can get away from you whenever I want.

04:19.007 --> 04:19.678
Hey.

04:21.796 --> 04:24.915
Lucas told me about Brooke. I was afraid something like this might happen.

04:25.063 --> 04:26.287
Ten points for Haley.

04:26.714 --> 04:27.792
How’s she doing?

04:28.300 --> 04:30.710
Who knows. I don’t think she’ll ever speak to me again.

04:31.034 --> 04:32.001
I know I wouldn’t.

04:43.275 --> 04:45.201
What’d you do? Knock over you dad’s dealership?

04:46.897 --> 04:49.450
Okay, none of my business. I’ll see ya.

04:49.522 --> 04:50.317
Okay.

04:50.572 --> 04:51.514
What is this?

04:51.724 --> 04:55.112
Dad gave it to me. His way of showing me who’s in control.

04:55.206 --> 04:56.589
Ew, give it back.

04:56.665 --> 04:59.920
No. If I’m going to live like this, I’m going to take everything I can get.

05:00.679 --> 05:01.483
Okay.

05:01.761 --> 05:03.193
So what’d you do last night?

05:03.270 --> 05:07.238
I was up all night bidding on ebay for those Sheryl Crow tickets.

05:07.320 --> 05:09.685
Oh yeah. The show’s tomorrow.

05:09.751 --> 05:10.858
- Yeah.
- Any luck?

05:10.950 --> 05:12.875
No, but there’s three more auctions tonight.

05:12.952 --> 05:15.241
I got DSL. Do you want to come over?

05:15.383 --> 05:16.341
Oh yeah!

05:22.916 --> 05:25.045
You sure you should be pushing yourself so hard, man?

05:26.990 --> 05:28.793
I thought you were supposed to be at physical therapy.

05:28.993 --> 05:30.769
Look all they let me do is stretch right now.

05:31.546 --> 05:36.807
You know I figured, I get back in here, I build up some muscle, be back in shape twice as fast.

05:37.006 --> 05:39.044
Or risk messing yourself up for good.

05:39.121 --> 05:40.487
Who’s side are you on anyway? Huh?

05:41.834 --> 05:43.303
I’m on your side, man.

05:44.212 --> 05:47.907
Look, all I’m saying is, dawg, what are you rushing back to?

05:48.061 --> 05:50.134
Look, I worked hard to be a part of this team, Skills.

05:50.723 --> 05:54.132
We’re undefeated. And I’m not giving up my spot now.

05:55.197 --> 05:58.084
Hey gimp. Coach wants to see you at practice, pronto.

05:58.304 --> 05:59.151
Why?

05:59.243 --> 06:00.430
What am I a psychic?

06:13.148 --> 06:16.259
- Brooke, I’m sorry.
- Yeah, sorry you got caught.

06:16.330 --> 06:17.654
We didn’t mean to hurt you.

06:17.793 --> 06:19.784
You did not just say that to me.

06:19.902 --> 06:23.640
Look, we didn’t plan any of this. It just happened.

06:23.941 --> 06:25.078
Go to hell.

06:35.380 --> 06:39.476
Tim, if you can’t knock down that shot I’ll find somebody who can.

06:39.716 --> 06:41.355
Now listen up, all of you.

06:41.470 --> 06:46.777
As long as we’re a man short, you’re gonna have to work double time to take up the slack.

06:46.951 --> 06:48.499
Alright, let’s play.

06:49.096 --> 06:50.341
You wanted to see me, Coach?

06:50.812 --> 06:53.285
Yeah. How’s that shoulder healing up?

06:54.262 --> 06:57.104
I’m working on it. It should be fine.

06:57.268 --> 06:58.645
Quit working on it.

06:58.757 --> 07:00.508
Coach, I know what I’m doing.

07:00.571 --> 07:03.739
So do I. You’re pushing yourself too hard.

07:03.800 --> 07:06.828
From now on I want you court side and out of the weight room.

07:08.214 --> 07:09.801
I’m useless here.

07:10.653 --> 07:14.000
- What’s the point?
- The point is I’m still your coach.

07:14.303 --> 07:18.767
And I’m going to need you at playoffs. Lay off the weights.

07:19.494 --> 07:20.508
Let’s go!

07:25.510 --> 07:26.852
Let’s get moving!

07:29.029 --> 07:31.168
Didn’t expect to see you back in the gym so soon.

07:31.854 --> 07:32.699
I’ll bet.

07:34.409 --> 07:37.415
- Here.
- No, I can get my own door.

07:39.273 --> 07:41.668
Fine. You’re welcome.

07:43.366 --> 07:44.455
I’m welcome?

07:45.099 --> 07:48.065
Yeah, for the whole rescue thing. Don’t sweat it.

07:48.162 --> 07:51.316
If you think I owe you a thank you, you gotta be kidding me.

07:51.417 --> 07:53.481
Oh what’d I do now? Save your life wrong?

07:53.542 --> 07:55.257
What you did doesn’t change who you are.

07:56.283 --> 07:58.064
Doesn’t make you a good guy.

07:58.648 --> 07:59.483
You’re right.

08:00.578 --> 08:03.393
I pulled you from that car so I could make your life a living hell.

08:03.988 --> 08:07.956
It was all a big plan so you could live to watch my son take his team to the state championships.

08:08.472 --> 08:10.790
Is that it? Is that what you want to hear?

08:15.679 --> 08:17.566
Nice shot, Nate. That a boy.

08:27.406 --> 08:30.020
Alright, let’s get back to business. Let’s go.

08:41.368 --> 08:42.231
Nathan.

08:42.308 --> 08:44.868
For once I’m with Lucas, Dad. I’ve got nothing to say to you.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.746
You forgot you bag this morning. You nearly drove over it in your brand new Mustang.

08:51.120 --> 08:52.372
I got clothes at home.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.185
What’s a guy got to do around here to get a little gratitude.

08:55.250 --> 08:59.742
You don’t want gratitude, Dad. That car’s an investment. You’re just looking for a return.

08:59.803 --> 09:01.451
You don’t want the car? Just say the word.

09:04.338 --> 09:06.357
Yeah, that’s what I thought.

09:07.406 --> 09:10.902
What do I have to do to prove to you, you made the right choice when you picked me?

09:11.815 --> 09:13.473
It wasn’t a choice, Dad.

09:14.036 --> 09:15.305
It was a lack of one.

09:22.505 --> 09:25.873
Brooke! Sooner or later you’re going to have to talk to me.

09:25.987 --> 09:31.220
Why don’t I just smile at you, you know, Peyton style, pretend everything’s okay and lie to your face.

09:31.271 --> 09:33.314
If I could go back to the way things were then I would.

09:33.374 --> 09:36.764
Back to when my best friend was cheating with my boyfriend and I was too stupid to realize it?

09:36.831 --> 09:37.911
You’re not stupid!

09:38.379 --> 09:39.365
Did you sleep with him?

09:39.442 --> 09:42.084
No! No I didn’t. Okay?

09:42.141 --> 09:43.994
We stopped before it got that far.

09:44.614 --> 09:46.733
God, Brooke, I am sorry, okay?

09:46.794 --> 09:50.035
We were going to tell you and then the accident happened and you liked him so much and I just…

09:50.117 --> 09:51.571
Thought you’d spare me the heartache?

09:51.708 --> 09:52.483
Yeah.

09:53.445 --> 09:56.179
Yeah well that worked out real well, didn’t it?

09:56.743 --> 09:57.500
Brooke!

09:57.593 --> 09:58.729
Are you in love with him?

10:07.080 --> 10:08.667
You know what, I don’t even care.

10:09.038 --> 10:11.514
He’s all yours now, have a great life together.

10:23.373 --> 10:24.238
Hey.

10:26.418 --> 10:28.130
I heard a rumor this place was for sale.

10:28.737 --> 10:30.050
Some financial crisis?

10:31.004 --> 10:33.894
Don’t tell me you’re trying to make good on a certain nephew’s medical expenses.

10:34.242 --> 10:36.499
I don’t have time for your jabs today, Danny.

10:37.981 --> 10:40.623
Tell you what. I’ll buy the place.

10:41.078 --> 10:42.915
- Yeah right.
- No, I’m serious.

10:43.102 --> 10:47.032
I’ll pay you market value for the property. You could pay off your debts with the profits.

10:47.099 --> 10:50.836
Meanwhile you could reopen the service center and run the place at a fair salary.

10:51.424 --> 10:52.792
You want me to work for you?

10:52.864 --> 10:56.212
Nope, no, you’ll still be your own boss, I’ll just be the guy behind the curtain.

10:56.422 --> 11:00.584
And once this place returns to profitability, I’ll even let you buy it back.

11:01.154 --> 11:02.946
You must really think I’m an idiot.

11:04.092 --> 11:08.204
Don’t be so paranoid, Keith. You did a good thing. I’d hate to see you go down for it.

11:09.448 --> 11:10.431
Since when?

11:11.772 --> 11:13.390
Maybe I turned over a new leaf.

11:14.087 --> 11:16.222
Regardless, you should think about this.

11:16.724 --> 11:19.969
Besides, I don’t see anyone breaking down the door with other offers.

11:29.119 --> 11:29.867
Hey.

11:30.332 --> 11:31.055
Hey.

11:31.204 --> 11:32.815
Welcome home. I missed you.

11:35.954 --> 11:37.312
I’ve only been gone a week, Mom.

11:37.387 --> 11:40.204
I’m sorry for the way things ended last time, Nate.

11:40.439 --> 11:41.202
Whatever.

11:43.739 --> 11:44.685
Nice car.

11:46.168 --> 11:47.193
Dan give it to you?

11:47.628 --> 11:49.302
Yeah. So?

11:49.574 --> 11:52.292
I just never considered him as bribing you.

11:53.019 --> 11:54.893
You know, it’s a little hard to compete on that level.

11:54.970 --> 11:56.204
I didn’t want this, Mom.

11:56.604 --> 11:59.423
I gave you a chance to come clean with me, but you didn’t want to do that.

11:59.552 --> 12:02.625
Nathan, you have to believe me. I’m only trying to protect you.

12:02.687 --> 12:06.407
From what? What could be worse than this, Mom?

12:08.624 --> 12:12.353
Fine, you know what? You want to keep your secrets. I guess we all lose.

12:15.880 --> 12:18.390
I can’t remember the last time the three of us did this.

12:19.019 --> 12:22.295
Yes, it’s just like old times. Minus one spleen.

12:24.599 --> 12:28.347
Oh come on, it’s a joke. Tragedy plus time. Haha.

12:28.920 --> 12:29.941
Alright, too soon.

12:32.697 --> 12:34.533
Do you ever do it at physical therapy?

12:34.651 --> 12:36.274
Physical Therapy’s a waste of time.

12:36.365 --> 12:39.090
Alright, let’s try something else. How was school?

12:39.157 --> 12:43.406
Well let’s see. Brooke hates me, and Peyton won’t talk to me.

12:43.457 --> 12:44.706
See it is like old times.

12:44.763 --> 12:46.186
Oh you know what else? I saw Dan.

12:46.272 --> 12:48.578
He told me the reason he pulled me out of the wreckage,

12:48.632 --> 12:51.224
was just so that you know, he could watch me suffer.

12:51.510 --> 12:53.088
Lucas, I’m sure that’s not true.

12:53.169 --> 12:55.090
Mom, don’t defend him.

12:55.355 --> 12:59.452
I’m not saying that Dan hasn’t don’t some terrible things, but he did save your life.

12:59.569 --> 13:00.681
Whatever that’s worth.

13:00.763 --> 13:03.073
Oh snap out of it already. Come on.

13:03.245 --> 13:06.390
You know what? You’re right. It’s time. Time for a change.

13:08.008 --> 13:09.856
- Where are you going?
- Out!

13:10.051 --> 13:11.079
- Luke!
- Don’t wait up.

13:37.567 --> 13:38.519
Give me a beer.

13:38.663 --> 13:40.004
Can I see your ID?

13:47.468 --> 13:49.589
- Bottle or draft?
- Draft’s fine.

14:02.766 --> 14:03.885
What do I owe you?

14:04.561 --> 14:05.442
She got it.

14:26.776 --> 14:30.422
Nice eye contact. You got a name?

14:31.543 --> 14:33.913
- I’m Lucas.
- You mean your name is Lucas.

14:34.016 --> 14:35.275
Yeah that’s what I said.

14:35.358 --> 14:38.221
No, you said you are Lucas, like you’re the only one out there.

14:38.306 --> 14:41.071
I’ve got news for you. It ain’t about you and it ain’t about me.

14:42.786 --> 14:44.973
Okay. Thanks for the beer.

14:45.700 --> 14:47.338
Do you believe in magic, Lucas?

14:49.202 --> 14:50.164
No, not really.

14:52.003 --> 14:53.070
That’s a shame.

14:54.175 --> 14:56.641
Sit down. Let me show you a trick.

14:58.413 --> 15:03.943
I’ll bet you, I can get this drink back in this glass,

15:05.004 --> 15:06.785
without touching the plate.

15:07.305 --> 15:08.202
What’s the bet?

15:10.885 --> 15:12.191
To be decided.

15:19.328 --> 15:20.964
See? Magic.

15:21.182 --> 15:22.175
Not bad.

15:22.436 --> 15:23.839
Yeah I’m full of tricks.

15:24.423 --> 15:26.901
Really? What’s your name?

15:27.424 --> 15:29.188
Buy me a drink. Maybe I’ll tell you.

16:16.120 --> 16:17.056
You okay?

16:17.278 --> 16:21.102
Oh um, actually it’s Karen. Lucas’ mom.

16:21.353 --> 16:23.211
Oh, hi.

16:23.409 --> 16:25.608
I’m trying to track Lucas down.

16:26.328 --> 16:29.314
Obviously he’s not answering his cell phone and...

16:29.750 --> 16:33.093
I tried the number he had for Brooke but she’s not answering either.

16:34.036 --> 16:35.807
Do you think maybe they’re together?

16:37.069 --> 16:38.976
I don’t really know.

16:39.228 --> 16:43.123
I don’t mean to sound like a dramatic mother but he did just get out of the hospital.

16:43.328 --> 16:47.710
No, yeah, um, I’ll talk to her. See if she knows where he is.

16:48.207 --> 16:49.461
Thank you, Peyton.

16:50.927 --> 16:51.966
Bye.

17:03.630 --> 17:06.691
Oh God, pull it together.

17:11.563 --> 17:12.512
Better.

17:15.849 --> 17:16.775
Hey.

17:17.349 --> 17:18.775
What are you doing here?

17:19.102 --> 17:20.593
You’re not answering your phone.

17:20.720 --> 17:23.781
And apparently you’re not getting the message. I don’t want to talk to you.

17:23.838 --> 17:25.717
I can’t believe you actually came over here.

17:25.779 --> 17:28.579
Lucas’ mom called. She can’t find him.

17:28.893 --> 17:30.310
Not my problem.

17:30.550 --> 17:37.103
Okay fine. But if you can figure out where he might be, at least call his mom.

17:37.519 --> 17:38.313
See ya.

17:40.345 --> 17:41.226
Wait.

17:46.218 --> 17:48.225
So. What’s your girlfriend’s name?

17:48.990 --> 17:50.390
Got one, right?

17:50.601 --> 17:51.675
Not anymore.

17:52.821 --> 17:54.231
I had two.

17:54.617 --> 17:58.172
Wow. You ever. What are they like?

17:58.419 --> 18:00.369
One’s all about fun.

18:01.276 --> 18:04.552
The other I kind of had this huge emotional connection to.

18:05.014 --> 18:06.836
But I screwed both those up.

18:07.471 --> 18:11.138
So you got a broken heart. What? You’re in here pouting.

18:11.686 --> 18:13.017
Boohoo.

18:14.136 --> 18:18.402
You know what the Easter bunny and true love have in common?

18:21.463 --> 18:24.573
Doesn’t matter. Cause they don’t exist.

18:26.795 --> 18:28.411
Sounds like you’ve been there.

18:32.002 --> 18:33.650
We all have our tangles.

18:34.663 --> 18:36.225
So you want to get out of here?

18:36.764 --> 18:38.519
I barely even know you.

18:38.622 --> 18:41.473
That’s kind of the point. Come on, live a little...

18:43.345 --> 18:44.520
Lucas

18:45.098 --> 18:46.255
Lucas.

18:48.421 --> 18:49.451
I’m Nikki.

18:51.355 --> 18:52.277
Let’s go.

18:56.337 --> 18:59.296
Yeah, yeah I have a copy right here.

19:00.429 --> 19:02.439
Okay perfect, I’ll send it off to you.

19:03.259 --> 19:05.005
Yeah, yeah, good bye.

19:06.000 --> 19:06.639
Hey.

19:07.543 --> 19:10.934
Sorry to drop in on you like this. Has Lucas been by tonight?

19:11.753 --> 19:13.187
Why? Is everything okay?

19:13.433 --> 19:16.449
I’m sure it’s fine. He might even be home right now.

19:19.053 --> 19:22.059
What’s with the for sale sign out front?

19:22.158 --> 19:26.484
Oh, I just, you know, ran into a small skid there for a little while but everything’s okay now.

19:27.011 --> 19:29.673
Selling was just a last resort.

19:30.482 --> 19:33.729
Okay that’s it, I’m just going to take a loan against the café and write you a check.

19:33.780 --> 19:37.431
Look, we already talked about it. I won’t cash your check.

19:37.492 --> 19:41.064
Keith, this is your livelihood. I’m not going to let you lose your business on account of my son’s expenses.

19:41.145 --> 19:44.282
Those are expenses he never would have had if it weren’t for me.

19:44.451 --> 19:47.425
And I’m not closing the shop, I’m just restructuring a little bit.

19:48.335 --> 19:49.273
What does that mean?

19:49.511 --> 19:52.206
Means I needed a financial backer and I found one.

19:53.032 --> 19:54.629
What, like a loan shark?

19:54.897 --> 19:58.643
No, it’s totally legit. Closing the deal tomorrow.

19:59.427 --> 20:01.751
Promise me you’re not about to do something stupid.

20:03.249 --> 20:04.628
I promise.

20:15.234 --> 20:16.318
What are we doing here?

20:16.419 --> 20:18.143
Lucas and I had our first date here.

20:18.580 --> 20:20.357
So what, you think he came here looking for you?

20:20.423 --> 20:23.715
No, I think he came here cause he knows they’ll take the fake ID I got him.

20:26.006 --> 20:26.926
What are you having ladies?

20:26.997 --> 20:32.620
Actually we’re trying to track somebody down. He’s tall, blondish, kind of a loaner.

20:32.681 --> 20:34.990
Cheats on his girlfriend with skinny blonde bitches.

20:35.317 --> 20:36.117
Nice.

20:38.164 --> 20:39.285
He was wearing this.

20:40.004 --> 20:40.969
On his shoulder.

20:41.121 --> 20:43.305
Right. You just missed him.

20:43.807 --> 20:48.225
But he wasn’t a loaner when he left, if you know what I mean.

20:49.029 --> 20:53.263
Hmm. You know I’m gonna have a beer.

20:54.240 --> 20:55.174
Make it two.

20:55.654 --> 20:56.433
You Got it.

20:58.004 --> 21:00.666
Okay, tell me you have that key because you work here.

21:00.728 --> 21:04.768
No, I said I used to work here. Now I just play here.

21:14.299 --> 21:15.243
Come on.

21:16.862 --> 21:20.114
You said you work here. What if we get busted.

21:20.365 --> 21:25.586
What if the ground opens up and swallows us. What if mars attacks.

21:25.668 --> 21:28.131
You can’t worry about all the what if’s in life.

21:30.389 --> 21:31.285
So...

21:33.614 --> 21:35.620
Relax and enjoy the ride.

21:39.375 --> 21:40.931
What happened to your shoulder?

21:42.351 --> 21:43.604
Car accident.

21:45.195 --> 21:46.378
Can I touch it?

22:06.703 --> 22:11.548
You know they say that you’re never more alive than the moment before you die.

22:13.004 --> 22:14.327
Was it a rush?

22:16.205 --> 22:17.574
I don’t remember.

22:27.437 --> 22:30.396
You have to pay attention to the important moments, Lucas.

22:32.003 --> 22:36.673
Sometimes, they only come around once.

23:05.991 --> 23:09.432
So is this your after school job, high school boy?

23:10.006 --> 23:11.373
You are in high school, right?

23:12.336 --> 23:13.006
Well…

23:13.135 --> 23:15.025
It’s okay. I like them young.

23:18.001 --> 23:20.672
Are you serious? You just had a whole banana split.

23:20.747 --> 23:21.930
What are you, the food police?

23:22.049 --> 23:24.372
I’m just saying, that’s not right.

23:24.471 --> 23:27.239
See that’s your problem. Everything for you breaks down to right and wrong.

23:27.599 --> 23:29.315
You ever think maybe it’s all gray?

23:29.693 --> 23:33.512
Not really. There’s right and there’s wrong.

23:33.911 --> 23:35.037
There’s good and bad.

23:35.463 --> 23:39.354
Okay, give me something’s that bad and I’ll tell you how it might be good.

23:40.102 --> 23:45.421
Okay. A busload of kids crashes.

23:45.611 --> 23:48.596
The kids go to heaven. There’s less pollution from the bus.

23:49.718 --> 23:51.432
Okay. Alright, alright.

23:52.520 --> 23:54.294
What’s the worst thing that’s ever happened to you?

23:54.351 --> 23:56.450
Forget it. I’m not the one in need of the attitude adjustment.

23:56.543 --> 23:58.682
I’ll be the judge of that. Come on.

23:59.478 --> 24:00.874
Tell me your darkest secret.

24:06.012 --> 24:08.031
You have any tabasco in this place?

24:08.529 --> 24:10.632
Yeah. Hold on.

24:16.764 --> 24:21.237
How about red peppers? Oh never mind, got it.

24:23.664 --> 24:24.728
Nikki?

24:29.802 --> 24:30.989
Nikki?

24:36.189 --> 24:37.483
You know, it’s funny.

24:38.138 --> 24:43.077
I look around at all these great looking guys and all I want to do is smash their pretty little faces.

24:43.529 --> 24:46.146
Don’t even ask what I’m thinking when I look at you.

24:49.567 --> 24:52.736
You know, with Lucas I can understand what happened.

24:52.878 --> 24:55.838
Especially given what he’s probably up to tonight.

24:55.997 --> 24:58.460
He’s a guy right? Guy’s screw you over.

24:58.556 --> 25:03.278
But you and I were best friends and I thought that was supposed to mean something.

25:03.322 --> 25:08.698
It does. God, Brooke, you will never know how sorry I am for making you question that.

25:09.706 --> 25:12.648
There was never a point to this whole thing that you weren’t my best friend.

25:12.718 --> 25:15.867
Really?! Well thank you for nothing.

25:20.384 --> 25:21.557
Okay, you know what?

25:22.790 --> 25:28.076
Hard to leave the glow of your love, but I gotta go. I’m babysitting for Jake in the morning.

25:28.211 --> 25:32.087
Playing house with Jake Jaglieski. Don’t waste any time, do you?

25:32.144 --> 25:33.153
It’s a favor.

25:35.293 --> 25:36.782
Brooke, are we ever going to get past this?

25:36.844 --> 25:40.417
I don’t know, Peyton. And right now, I don’t really care.

25:50.603 --> 25:51.661
No.

25:59.449 --> 26:03.284
I know. I know I’m late. You don’t deserve that.

26:03.341 --> 26:04.816
You’re damn right I don’t.

26:05.512 --> 26:06.392
I’m sorry.

26:06.691 --> 26:09.536
You know, you’ve been saying that a lot lately.

26:11.034 --> 26:12.822
What happened tonight, Lucas?

26:17.084 --> 26:21.071
It’s just... I’ve been screwing up a lot, Mom.

26:22.787 --> 26:26.452
I thought I could join the team and deal with it all.

26:27.620 --> 26:29.376
You know, basketball and the rest of it.

26:30.144 --> 26:34.599
But ever since I left the river court, I’ve been a mess.

26:35.428 --> 26:37.336
I fought with you and Keith,

26:38.318 --> 26:39.816
and Haley.

26:40.661 --> 26:43.363
And I drove away two girls that I really cared about.

26:44.680 --> 26:49.381
Look, Luke... being a teenager is hard.

26:50.995 --> 26:53.308
Honestly, it’s all hard.

26:55.309 --> 26:57.835
But you have a lot of good things going for you.

26:58.111 --> 26:59.415
I know I do.

27:00.849 --> 27:02.191
And you’re one of them.

27:06.695 --> 27:11.351
I think part of being a man, is owning up to your mistakes.

27:13.669 --> 27:16.865
So I promise you, I’m going to do better.

27:17.474 --> 27:18.785
Oh, I know you will.

27:22.318 --> 27:25.442
Well, for a plan B that worked out pretty well.

27:27.694 --> 27:29.132
What was plan A?

27:30.292 --> 27:33.617
I was going to kick you in the ass and ground you for life.

27:34.519 --> 27:36.935
Well, I prefer plan B.

27:37.626 --> 27:38.682
Good night.

27:40.550 --> 27:41.272
Night.

27:45.010 --> 27:45.774
Hey.

27:47.230 --> 27:48.154
What’d you get lost?

27:49.008 --> 27:51.659
I took a little drive, needed to clear my head.

27:52.884 --> 27:53.698
And?

27:54.261 --> 27:55.342
I’m here, aren’t I?

27:56.878 --> 27:58.921
I knew you’d do the right thing for yourself in the end.

27:58.997 --> 28:02.007
Well believe me, if I saw any other way out I’d take it.

28:03.370 --> 28:05.382
Why are you so quick to think the worst of me, Keith?

28:05.459 --> 28:07.240
Because I’ve known you my whole life, Dan.

28:07.932 --> 28:09.160
Feel free to prove me wrong.

28:10.108 --> 28:13.077
Well my lawyers have looked over the contracts, everything’s as we discussed.

28:13.427 --> 28:16.206
All it needs is your signature.

28:25.498 --> 28:27.756
Did I ever tell you what a wonderful job you’ve done?

28:27.896 --> 28:30.716
I think you’ve thanked me a million times.

28:32.292 --> 28:34.495
Actually, it’s more than thanks.

28:35.998 --> 28:39.374
I’ve been thinking, we should partner up.

28:40.517 --> 28:42.149
Business has never been better.

28:42.865 --> 28:47.417
Oh I’m flattered, Karen, but I can’t.

28:48.349 --> 28:54.054
In the past, when things got bad with Dan, I would use work as an excuse to get away from him.

28:54.212 --> 28:58.293
Nathan was always the one to suffer for it. I don’t want that to happen again.

29:00.188 --> 29:05.153
I just hope it’s not too late. Dan is already poisoning him against me.

29:05.435 --> 29:10.653
If Dan is telling lies about you just make sure Nathan knows the facts.

29:11.656 --> 29:16.069
What if what Dan’s telling him isn’t a lie?

29:16.858 --> 29:19.623
Whatever it is, Nathan doesn’t know your side.

29:20.028 --> 29:21.461
You got to talk to him, Deb.

29:25.003 --> 29:27.017
Life is so unfair.

29:27.356 --> 29:28.978
You didn’t get the Sheryl Crow tickets?

29:29.079 --> 29:30.627
No, we got sniped.

29:30.841 --> 29:31.819
I’m sorry.

29:32.372 --> 29:33.847
Haley, do you know where Nathan is?

29:34.717 --> 29:37.893
Um, I think he’s still at your house.

29:39.013 --> 29:40.104
I’m gonna…

29:42.830 --> 29:43.846
How’s Lucas?

29:44.112 --> 29:45.571
I think he’s going to be fine.

29:49.084 --> 29:50.378
- Hey yo.
- Yo.

29:51.500 --> 29:55.699
What’s up, dawg? How’s that shoulder feeling, man? Up for a game?

29:56.384 --> 29:58.910
It’s gonna be a while before I’m back on the court, Skills.

29:59.176 --> 30:00.892
Look man, I brought you a little something.

30:01.731 --> 30:03.404
Might help you get back a little quicker.

30:04.787 --> 30:05.995
Remember signing this?

30:08.075 --> 30:09.575
4th grade.

30:10.374 --> 30:13.620
Man we promised each other those signatures would be worth millions one day.

30:13.727 --> 30:14.572
Remember that?

30:15.304 --> 30:16.042
Yep.

30:16.825 --> 30:20.874
It’s your turn to hold on to it. Help keep you focused on that prize.

30:21.249 --> 30:23.153
- Thanks, man.
- Do what you got to do.

30:23.543 --> 30:27.791
Just remember, you always got us. Alright?

30:28.759 --> 30:29.455
Alright.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.325
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:34.658 --> 30:36.828
Nice Suit. What, they got you parking cars?

30:37.003 --> 30:38.155
You’re funny.

30:39.107 --> 30:41.902
Shh, it’s okay, it’s okay, it’s okay.

30:42.003 --> 30:45.205
Come here. Hey Jenny. Hey, remember me?

30:45.282 --> 30:48.876
- It's Peyton.
- Hey. How are you? I missed you.

30:48.959 --> 30:51.805
So I’m sorry you couldn’t meet my parents, they took off for the wedding separately.

30:51.851 --> 30:55.199
- My dad, he likes to get an early start.
- Yeah my dad’s the total opposite.

30:55.279 --> 30:57.867
He’s totally like 3 minutes before the flight kind of guy.

30:58.003 --> 31:01.646
Okay so look, I wrote everything down. When she eats, when she sleeps,

31:01.712 --> 31:05.256
what toys she likes. And I put all my numbers down. My cell, my pager.

31:05.308 --> 31:09.215
I’ve got my moms, my dads, my cousin who’s getting married, I put his number down.

31:09.286 --> 31:12.912
If you need anything at all I’m just going to be less than an hour away so just call anybody…

31:12.972 --> 31:14.647
Jake, we’re going to be cool.

31:16.003 --> 31:16.617
Okay.

31:17.857 --> 31:19.106
I guess I’m a little nervous.

31:19.254 --> 31:22.215
I’ve never left her alone with anybody but my parents before.

31:23.170 --> 31:24.293
And you picked me?

31:24.774 --> 31:25.435
Well I…

31:25.485 --> 31:28.076
I’m just kidding. I’m kidding with you, it’s okay.

31:28.563 --> 31:29.848
Go, have fun at the wedding.

31:30.007 --> 31:34.594
Okay, okay. Alright, I’ll be back in a few hours, okay Angel?

31:34.835 --> 31:36.279
- You be good.
- Take your time.

31:36.417 --> 31:37.533
Alright, thanks Peyton.

31:38.260 --> 31:40.882
Bye. Hey.

31:41.859 --> 31:47.193
Well, if it’s not Mr. Scott. What do I owe this pleasure?

31:48.321 --> 31:50.134
I came to apologize, Coach.

31:50.649 --> 31:51.632
Sit down.

31:56.065 --> 31:58.193
I’ve been kind of screwing up.

31:59.616 --> 32:01.878
I shouldn’t have walked out on practice the other day.

32:02.169 --> 32:03.353
You’re right.

32:04.834 --> 32:07.439
But, you’ve got a lot on your plate.

32:09.016 --> 32:11.269
I’ve been thinking about my position on the team.

32:11.315 --> 32:14.669
That spot’s yours. It will be there when you’re ready.

32:15.007 --> 32:15.836
Yeah, I know but...

32:15.903 --> 32:21.693
If we lose a game or two along the way then so be it.

32:25.661 --> 32:26.875
I appreciate that.

32:27.919 --> 32:29.916
But we both know you need another shooter.

32:31.555 --> 32:34.744
If that means that you’ve got to fill my spot,

32:35.887 --> 32:38.017
then I’m asking you to give someone else a chance.

32:39.721 --> 32:43.361
Look the guys are undefeated. That’s important to me.

32:44.160 --> 32:45.481
It’s important to them.

32:46.506 --> 32:48.194
Apology accepted.

32:50.837 --> 32:52.311
Thanks, Coach.

32:55.460 --> 32:56.899
Take care of yourself.

33:05.555 --> 33:06.500
Nate.

33:08.385 --> 33:09.740
Can we talk for a minute?

33:16.756 --> 33:21.091
I don’t want to keep secrets from you, Nathan, so I’m telling you this because I love you

33:21.693 --> 33:23.953
and because I think you deserve the truth.

33:32.543 --> 33:36.734
A while ago, your father and I were having serious trouble.

33:38.430 --> 33:40.414
And, I met someone else.

33:41.894 --> 33:44.065
I left your father to be with this man.

33:44.797 --> 33:45.688
When?

33:46.513 --> 33:51.100
A few years back. You were at basketball camp for the summer.

33:52.436 --> 33:55.171
When I came back, Dad told me you were gone on a business trip.

33:55.232 --> 33:58.498
Please understand, I was confused and I was selfish.

33:59.655 --> 34:04.798
As soon as I realized I might risk losing you forever I called it all off and came back.

34:05.085 --> 34:07.739
But Nathan, I have never forgiven myself.

34:07.913 --> 34:10.411
You don’t know how hard it’s been for me to live with this guilt.

34:10.483 --> 34:11.456
Hard for you?

34:12.297 --> 34:16.233
Dad was a nightmare that summer, Mom. You know that.

34:16.770 --> 34:19.512
And all those nights I called you to tell you how he was

34:19.578 --> 34:21.864
you didn’t come home because you were with some guy.

34:22.444 --> 34:25.435
Don’t you see what you did? You gave me to him, Mom.

34:25.501 --> 34:28.696
You knew exactly how he was and you made me dad’s property.

34:28.763 --> 34:30.437
Oh, I never thought that…

34:30.493 --> 34:32.280
Everything he’s turned me into. All of this.

34:33.790 --> 34:35.208
This is your fault.

34:36.063 --> 34:38.496
That’s why I came home. For you.

34:38.562 --> 34:42.853
No, you didn’t come home for me, Mom. You came home because your fling ended.

34:47.007 --> 34:51.250
Just forget it. I don’t want to be a part of this family anymore.

34:52.206 --> 34:53.107
Nathan.

35:01.003 --> 35:04.538
So now I know. I don’t ever remember feeling like this, Haley.

35:04.600 --> 35:09.203
I mean, yeah with my dad, but she abandoned me.

35:09.888 --> 35:10.953
I’m sorry.

35:11.870 --> 35:14.630
I can’t go back there. And I can’t live with my dad either.

35:15.879 --> 35:16.899
I’m screwed.

35:18.687 --> 35:19.632
Maybe not.

35:20.483 --> 35:21.855
There might be an answer.

35:31.374 --> 35:33.293
What in the hell are you doing?

35:33.838 --> 35:35.202
Oh, you must be Keith.

35:36.584 --> 35:37.817
Name’s Matt Perry.

35:38.003 --> 35:38.827
Yeah.

35:41.540 --> 35:43.220
I guess I’m your new boss.

35:43.654 --> 35:44.971
Like hell you are.

35:48.807 --> 35:51.678
Hey. You want to tell me what in the hell is going on here?

35:52.247 --> 35:55.124
Dan Scott Service Annex? What are you out of your mind?

35:55.216 --> 35:58.047
Well Dan Scott is a brand name. We wanted to attract the right kind of customer.

35:58.108 --> 36:00.110
There’s a guy out there telling me he’s my boss.

36:00.184 --> 36:03.312
Well, Matt runs my service department so technically you do fall under his jurisdiction.

36:03.373 --> 36:05.799
Yeah, well technically you can kiss my ass.

36:06.272 --> 36:11.830
Come on. What did you expect? A hand out? This was a legitimate business deal.

36:12.005 --> 36:13.418
Yeah? Well I want out.

36:13.914 --> 36:17.785
Well things don’t work that way, Keith. You walk away now, this shop is mine.

36:23.090 --> 36:26.439
Oh no, no. Hey, hey. Remember these?

36:26.568 --> 36:29.535
Okay. Yeah.

36:30.568 --> 36:33.709
Okay, no you don’t want to put those in your mouth because these are gross.

36:34.338 --> 36:38.435
Shh. Oh no.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.624
Who’re you going to be, little girl?

36:58.494 --> 36:59.523
Shh.

37:08.491 --> 37:10.286
Look at this.

37:11.762 --> 37:15.150
I got copies. How was the wedding?

37:15.263 --> 37:17.542
Oh, it was good. I mean it’s a wedding, you know?

37:18.202 --> 37:22.370
My parents were having a good time so they decided to stay downtown.

37:23.004 --> 37:26.193
Alright, then I’ll clear out and you can relax while it’s still quiet.

37:26.266 --> 37:31.709
Well hey, I could order pizza, pop in a movie. It’s the least I could do.

37:32.624 --> 37:35.066
Okay. No chick flicks.

37:35.851 --> 37:37.027
No chick flicks.

37:50.137 --> 37:51.114
What is this?

37:51.395 --> 37:53.746
I’m petitioning for emancipation from you and dad.

37:54.369 --> 37:55.231
What?

37:56.302 --> 37:59.378
I talked to a lawyer. Says I have case.

37:59.731 --> 38:01.215
I’ll be living by myself.

38:03.009 --> 38:04.939
How does it feel to be abandoned, Mom?

38:19.261 --> 38:21.553
I know you don’t have any reason to listen to me.

38:21.756 --> 38:22.704
You’re right I don’t.

38:23.221 --> 38:26.197
Brooke. I’m not asking for forgiveness.

38:26.573 --> 38:30.758
I just want you to know how sorry I am for what I did.

38:30.851 --> 38:32.146
How sorry you are?

38:34.010 --> 38:39.263
Do you know that the entire time that we were dating I actually felt inferior to you?

38:40.532 --> 38:44.484
What a joke. You are just like every other guy on the planet.

38:44.531 --> 38:46.934
You’re a liar and a cheater.

38:47.792 --> 38:50.567
You’re right. I lied to you.

38:51.612 --> 38:53.344
And there’s no excuse for that.

38:53.968 --> 38:54.814
Whatever.

38:56.128 --> 38:58.931
Why don’t you tell it to the girl you hooked up with last night.

39:01.008 --> 39:04.403
As far as excuses, you don’t owe me any. I’m not your girlfriend.

39:05.187 --> 39:08.397
And from here on out, I’m not even your friend.

39:21.238 --> 39:22.344
Sorry we’re…

39:24.217 --> 39:25.724
I was hoping to get a cup of coffee.

39:25.859 --> 39:27.939
Open! We are so open.

39:28.908 --> 39:31.370
Cup of cup, uh cup cup of coffee, yeah.

39:31.437 --> 39:32.962
We can, uh, we can do that for you.

39:33.505 --> 39:37.837
Sheryl Crow. I’m a huge fan.

39:38.402 --> 39:41.641
You have no idea how much it killed me to miss your concert tonight.

39:41.871 --> 39:44.733
We waited on line and everything and then the stupid ebay snipers just…

39:44.810 --> 39:46.893
Haley. Let it go.

39:47.231 --> 39:48.071
Right.

39:48.333 --> 39:50.253
Thanks. How much do I owe you?

39:52.122 --> 39:53.479
One song per cup.

40:20.156 --> 40:23.231
You know the sad thing is, nobody’s going to believe us when we tell them.

40:24.239 --> 40:25.377
I can solve that problem.

40:52.794 --> 40:54.495
What is it? What’s the matter?

40:56.010 --> 40:57.817
He’s leaving us, Dan.

41:02.756 --> 41:04.155
And I don’t blame him.

42:19.392 --> 42:20.763
Hi, Jake.

42:22.467 --> 42:23.476
Nikki.

42:26.748 --> 42:28.861
So, how’s my daughter?

42:29.305 --> 42:35.464
