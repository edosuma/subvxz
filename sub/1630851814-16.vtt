WEBVTT

00:50.425 --> 00:52.761
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION
BASED IN A DYSTOPIAN KOREA

00:52.844 --> 00:55.346
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

01:05.231 --> 01:06.983
Why did the police arrest Yo-han?

01:08.943 --> 01:10.487
What is going on?

01:16.659 --> 01:19.329
Why can't you tell me? What's this about?

01:22.749 --> 01:26.252
Did Yo-han really do that
to the cathedral?

01:28.087 --> 01:31.674
Was it Yo-han who killed my parents?

01:33.760 --> 01:36.304
No, Elijah. That's not it.

01:45.188 --> 01:46.731
It's all my fault.

01:48.775 --> 01:51.236
I was an idiot to be deceived
by those bastards

01:54.072 --> 01:56.449
and called the police to say
Yo-han killed Su-hyeon.

01:58.660 --> 01:59.828
What?

02:00.995 --> 02:02.705
I'll set it right somehow.

02:03.414 --> 02:04.541
I promise

02:05.375 --> 02:06.793
I'll bring Yo-han back.

02:07.585 --> 02:09.546
Even if it costs my life.

02:11.381 --> 02:13.466
Why?

02:13.550 --> 02:15.176
Why did you?

02:16.553 --> 02:18.638
Why did you?

02:20.140 --> 02:21.432
I'm sorry, Elijah.

02:23.643 --> 02:24.936
Why did you?

02:47.750 --> 02:48.710
Ma'am.

02:51.170 --> 02:53.590
Please stay with Elijah.

02:53.673 --> 02:54.674
Please.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.176
What about you, Master Ga-on?

03:03.349 --> 03:06.603
Geez, you rushed in here
in the middle of the night for this?

03:08.438 --> 03:12.108
So in other words,
you're saying that Judge Kang

03:12.191 --> 03:14.944
has nothing to do
with Inspector Yoon Su-hyeon's death,

03:15.028 --> 03:17.155
and that everything had been ordered

03:17.238 --> 03:19.574
by Jung Seon-a, the Chairwoman of the SRF.

03:20.575 --> 03:21.576
Yes.

03:24.203 --> 03:26.748
All right, I understood you very well.

03:27.707 --> 03:29.959
Though all of this is very interesting,

03:30.043 --> 03:34.172
as you know, we can't act on it
without enough evidence.

03:36.507 --> 03:37.967
Wait.

03:40.428 --> 03:42.222
I had falsely accused Kang Yo-han.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.225
Oh, sure.

03:46.434 --> 03:48.770
-So it's a false accusation?
-Yes.

03:50.438 --> 03:52.190
I reported him with malicious intent.

03:52.941 --> 03:55.860
After seeing him hush the trial scandal
by manipulating the public opinion,

03:55.944 --> 03:58.154
I thought I needed to do
whatever I can to stop him.

03:58.238 --> 04:02.033
So I forged evidence with my own hands
and falsely reported him.

04:04.994 --> 04:06.204
Arrest me.

04:06.913 --> 04:07.997
Judge Kim.

04:08.623 --> 04:11.042
Don't get worked up.

04:12.377 --> 04:14.837
Why not go home for tonight,
get a good night's sleep,

04:15.421 --> 04:16.756
and think this over?

04:17.882 --> 04:20.385
Why drag it on when it's as good as over?

04:21.177 --> 04:23.638
I see you are already ordered from above.

04:25.056 --> 04:28.309
If you keep this up, I'll report you
for dereliction of duty, Detective.

04:29.018 --> 04:30.520
And take this to the media.

04:34.065 --> 04:35.608
Feel free to do whatever you want.

04:37.026 --> 04:39.737
Oh, right. By the way, you do realize

04:39.821 --> 04:42.240
we are under a state of
emergency, don't you?

04:42.824 --> 04:45.368
Reckless reporting without
permission from the government

04:45.451 --> 04:47.078
is considered obstruction of
emergency operations.

04:48.371 --> 04:50.039
So good luck trying.

04:50.957 --> 04:53.251
I doubt any media company
will be insane enough to do that.

05:21.821 --> 05:23.406
Kang Yo-han!

05:23.489 --> 05:25.033
It's Kang Yo-han!

05:26.034 --> 05:28.244
I missed you! Welcome, you bastard!

05:29.329 --> 05:30.830
You will never get out of here.

05:30.913 --> 05:33.916
Why? Because I'll kill you!

05:34.000 --> 05:36.544
That's right, I'll kill you!

05:38.296 --> 05:40.590
This place will be your grave!

06:14.207 --> 06:15.666
<i>Breaking news.</i>

06:15.750 --> 06:18.711
<i>Judge Kang Yo-han
of the Department of Live Court Show was</i>

06:18.795 --> 06:20.505
<i>arrested last night
for abetment of murder,</i>

06:20.588 --> 06:22.423
<i>and is currently detained
at the Central Detention Center.</i>

06:22.507 --> 06:26.219
<i>It has been revealed that
the victim of his conspiracy is</i>

06:26.302 --> 06:28.012
<i>Inspector Yoon Su-hyeon
at the Police Agency…</i>

06:28.096 --> 06:29.055
No way.

06:29.138 --> 06:30.890
<i>Judge Kang Yo-han,
who was arrested without a warrant,</i>

06:30.973 --> 06:32.767
<i>enjoyed strong support from the public</i>

06:32.850 --> 06:35.561
<i>as the presiding judge
of the Department of Live Court Show.</i>

06:35.645 --> 06:37.688
<i>Therefore,
his suspicions of contract killing</i>

06:37.772 --> 06:40.525
<i>is expected to draw
strong criticisms from the public.</i>

06:41.275 --> 06:44.070
It was you, Chief Justice,
who nominated Kang Yo-han

06:44.153 --> 06:45.822
as the presiding judge
of the <i>Live Court Show.</i>

06:45.905 --> 06:49.325
A criminal who rigged trials
and abetted murder.

06:49.408 --> 06:53.746
But Justice Min,
how was I supposed to know?

06:53.830 --> 06:57.125
Besides, it wasn't my idea
to nominate Kang Yo-han--

06:57.208 --> 06:59.544
Now you'll evade responsibilities, too?

06:59.627 --> 07:00.837
Look, Justice Min.

07:02.421 --> 07:05.091
I suggest you make a decision
that won't put the judicature

07:05.758 --> 07:07.176
to further shame.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.315
You're here.

07:34.954 --> 07:37.123
I thought you'd retired
from the Supreme Court.

07:40.376 --> 07:43.004
Someone has to try and save the situation,

07:43.087 --> 07:45.631
and I am not someone
to dodge the responsibilities.

07:48.092 --> 07:50.303
Just how shameless are you?

07:51.888 --> 07:52.889
Did you

07:54.974 --> 07:56.267
really kill Su-hyeon?

07:57.101 --> 07:59.187
To entrap Kang Yo-han?

07:59.270 --> 08:01.189
How can you call yourself human?

08:04.609 --> 08:06.110
I didn't know Su-hyeon would die.

08:08.654 --> 08:11.491
I didn't know Chairwoman Jung Seon-a
would go to such lengths.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.869
One, two, three.

08:23.044 --> 08:24.670
A justice of the Supreme Court?

08:26.797 --> 08:30.468
I know you're not someone
who's obsessed with titles.

08:31.344 --> 08:34.263
But the times call for
someone like you, Professor.

08:35.389 --> 08:37.934
We're seeing someone like
President Heo in politics

08:38.017 --> 08:40.645
and Judge Kang Yo-han
presiding over the court, aren't we?

08:41.979 --> 08:43.314
Yes, they're all the same.

08:44.857 --> 08:46.943
Frauds who mislead the public.

08:47.026 --> 08:51.280
This <i>Live Court Show</i>
that they're planning is a dangerous idea.

08:51.364 --> 08:54.742
What they're doing is demeaning
trials to a mere street show.

08:57.495 --> 08:59.956
Whilst I'm serving Master Seo Jeong-hak,

09:01.624 --> 09:05.211
I also agree we need to stop
this movement, no matter what.

09:07.296 --> 09:10.591
Suppose we can do
something discreetly about it.

09:11.884 --> 09:14.303
I at the Foundation
and you, at the Supreme Court.

09:21.936 --> 09:23.771
You're extremely brave.

09:25.648 --> 09:27.567
But we need someone to step forward.

09:28.985 --> 09:31.737
Once you are appointed justice,
the first thing you must do

09:32.738 --> 09:35.992
is to find a watchdog for Kang Yo-han.

09:36.826 --> 09:37.910
Watchdog?

09:40.746 --> 09:41.831
Professor.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.460
Sorry, I mean "Justice Min."

09:46.544 --> 09:49.672
Are you telling me to be Judas?

09:51.090 --> 09:52.925
We'll need that someone, won't we?

09:53.009 --> 09:56.846
That someone who'll remain firm
in this crazy storm.

10:00.099 --> 10:01.434
I'm begging you.

10:01.976 --> 10:06.188
<i>There is no easy justice
in the mortal world.</i>

10:07.690 --> 10:11.027
I'd only wanted to stop Kang Yo-han,

10:12.361 --> 10:14.530
who was ruining this world.

10:16.115 --> 10:18.784
Kang Yo-han's supporters are attacking me

10:19.452 --> 10:21.787
and leaking personal information
about my family.

10:22.872 --> 10:24.498
I can't put up with it anymore.

10:25.416 --> 10:27.043
I'll do whatever I can

10:28.294 --> 10:31.255
to bring him down.

10:39.805 --> 10:41.474
Did you kill Su-hyeon?

10:42.600 --> 10:44.852
That wasn't in our discussion!

10:47.772 --> 10:50.024
Su-hyeon was like a daughter to me.

10:50.941 --> 10:51.984
So…

10:53.069 --> 10:55.363
you'll pull out, after all this time?

10:57.156 --> 10:59.700
I thought you'd said
you wanted to stop Kang Yo-han,

10:59.784 --> 11:01.702
using whatever means.

11:13.881 --> 11:15.966
You cannot turn back what's happened.

11:16.675 --> 11:18.594
Besides, you're just a step away.

11:19.428 --> 11:23.849
Don't you want to be remembered in history

11:24.600 --> 11:27.311
as the great Chief Justice
who ended this madness?

11:31.524 --> 11:32.650
Well?

11:33.943 --> 11:35.444
Justice Min.

11:40.116 --> 11:43.411
<i>Someone needed to stop Kang Yo-han
even if it meant becoming a monster.</i>

11:45.788 --> 11:47.832
You can condemn me if you want

11:49.125 --> 11:51.710
because history will judge me.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.046
You disgusting hypocrite!

12:02.096 --> 12:03.556
Call security.

12:05.141 --> 12:08.352
How could you?
How could you kill Su-hyeon?

12:09.228 --> 12:10.771
How?

12:10.855 --> 12:13.232
How could you kill Su-hyeon?

12:13.315 --> 12:16.318
Tell me. Min Jeong-ho, tell me!

12:16.402 --> 12:18.112
-Tell me!
-Justice Min.

12:18.779 --> 12:19.738
Tell me.

12:19.822 --> 12:23.200
Let go! Min Jeong-ho, tell me!

12:24.702 --> 12:25.911
Tell me!

12:26.412 --> 12:27.621
How could you?

12:28.497 --> 12:29.457
Min Jeong-ho!

12:36.714 --> 12:38.632
Judge Kim, what was that on the news?

12:38.716 --> 12:41.218
It's not true, right?
It wasn't Judge Kang, right?

12:41.886 --> 12:44.346
No. It's a trap set up by the Foundation.

12:45.347 --> 12:46.599
I knew it.

12:47.683 --> 12:51.103
What should I do? I'll help.
We'll need to save Judge Kang, won't we?

13:05.367 --> 13:06.535
Well, look at this.

13:11.415 --> 13:13.292
So they say you'll meet your enemy
at a dead end.

13:13.375 --> 13:15.961
Do you know what trouble you got me into?

13:16.670 --> 13:18.422
Did you manage to convince the warden?

13:18.506 --> 13:21.967
Yes, he's completely intimidated
so he will do as you say.

13:22.051 --> 13:24.094
<i>Is it true the orders
came from Minister Cha?</i>

13:24.178 --> 13:25.679
MINISTER CHA KYUNG-HEE GAVE ORDERS
TO SNEAK OUT DO YOUNG-CHOON

13:25.763 --> 13:28.015
<i>Yes, the orders were
from Minister Cha Gyeong-hui.</i>

13:28.098 --> 13:30.392
<i>Is it true you were bribed or blackmailed?</i>

13:31.435 --> 13:32.686
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

13:32.770 --> 13:35.231
However,
I could not withstand her blackmail.

13:35.314 --> 13:38.150
Thanks to you, I was demoted
and ended up here.

13:38.943 --> 13:41.487
Isn't it a stroke of good luck
in the midst of misfortune

13:41.570 --> 13:43.489
to be put in charge of a victim
of a major case?

13:49.745 --> 13:51.288
Enough of your arrogance.

13:52.831 --> 13:55.334
Hey you,
do you think you're still a judge?

13:55.417 --> 13:58.295
Now you're nothing but a rat in my grasp.

13:58.379 --> 13:59.672
Did you hear me?

14:15.521 --> 14:18.190
You sure are something, Chairwoman Jung.

14:18.274 --> 14:21.026
When did you drag Min Jeong-ho
over to our side?

14:21.110 --> 14:23.571
-You're the best!
-The best!

14:39.837 --> 14:43.924
-Gosh, Chairwoman Jung.
-Sit.

14:46.552 --> 14:50.890
Chairwoman Jung,
you sure are an amazing storyteller.

14:51.891 --> 14:56.103
I mean, remember how even
Jesus was backstabbed

14:56.186 --> 14:58.063
by his most beloved disciple?

14:59.106 --> 15:00.357
He really got done.

15:00.441 --> 15:05.154
I bet that's what Kang Yo-han is
going through in prison right now.

15:05.237 --> 15:07.907
Abetting the murder of a police officer…

15:08.824 --> 15:10.993
Kang Yo-han is now out of the game.

15:12.286 --> 15:16.749
But is there really a need
to take Kang Yo-han to court?

15:17.875 --> 15:19.126
What do you mean?

15:22.713 --> 15:25.716
Well, now that
he's come down from the stage,

15:25.799 --> 15:28.719
wouldn't it make everyone happy

15:28.802 --> 15:31.305
if he were to make a quick, quiet exit?

15:32.056 --> 15:33.724
That's just my thinking, anyway.

15:34.224 --> 15:37.853
Don't you think
you have too much on your mind?

15:37.937 --> 15:41.106
They say it's a sign
you're nearing your grave.

15:42.358 --> 15:43.442
I'm sorry, ma'am.

15:44.109 --> 15:46.820
I should have known to
just trust that you'll do a good job.

15:46.904 --> 15:49.823
I'm sorry. Let me go to the bathroom.

15:50.532 --> 15:51.867
Hold it right there!

15:52.952 --> 15:57.164
Why did you say that
when she has it all under control?

15:58.207 --> 15:59.166
Exactly!

15:59.917 --> 16:03.337
Chairwoman Jung
is not an amateur, you know.

16:09.718 --> 16:12.054
<i>Mr. Heo Joong-se
sure is quick to adapt, isn't he?</i>

16:13.055 --> 16:15.891
He's become a whole
different person with his new role.

16:15.975 --> 16:16.976
Yes.

16:18.602 --> 16:19.728
However…

16:21.230 --> 16:23.899
he's adapted almost too quickly.

16:24.942 --> 16:25.943
What?

16:26.527 --> 16:29.613
Not only that,
those money-grubbing weasels

16:29.697 --> 16:33.117
<i>were playing along with him.</i>

16:36.745 --> 16:39.623
I may have underestimated Heo Joong-se.

16:40.541 --> 16:43.669
Look into it. I'm sure there's something.

16:46.171 --> 16:47.756
That man, Heo Joong-se…

16:48.757 --> 16:52.678
I remember him being obsessed
with increasing the number of migrants.

16:54.346 --> 16:56.682
Check the Dream Base village

16:57.349 --> 16:59.601
to see whether
there are any missing numbers

16:59.685 --> 17:02.271
and whether he's been
sneaking them out elsewhere.

17:07.192 --> 17:10.529
Thank you for delaying my husband's plan.

17:10.612 --> 17:12.322
Oh, you mean the weekend farm?

17:12.406 --> 17:16.410
Yes. You've done a great job
convincing your husbands too.

17:16.493 --> 17:17.953
It was so close.

17:18.954 --> 17:23.500
Don't mention it.
We're always for where the money is.

17:26.295 --> 17:29.590
Since we're on the topic,
how about we pay a visit?

17:30.174 --> 17:31.508
Sounds good.

17:31.592 --> 17:35.220
I wonder whether
our crops are growing well.

17:36.388 --> 17:38.182
All right, I'll make arrangements.

17:44.772 --> 17:46.398
I understand you fell into a trap,

17:46.482 --> 17:49.151
but how could you accuse him
of being a murderer?

17:52.154 --> 17:55.282
I know I'm shameless to ask this,
but please help me this once.

17:55.365 --> 17:58.410
I need to save Judge Kang,
and it's impossible without your help.

17:58.494 --> 18:00.120
Well…

18:00.204 --> 18:03.582
I'm not sure whether
we can trust you anymore.

18:03.665 --> 18:05.584
But there's no time.

18:05.667 --> 18:09.838
Do you suppose they'll just let him be
until his trial commences?

18:10.506 --> 18:12.174
Who knows what they'll do next?

18:14.218 --> 18:18.138
Our only way is to expose something big
that'll tie their hands down.

18:18.222 --> 18:21.642
With all the attention on them,
they will lay low for the time being.

18:21.725 --> 18:22.810
Hold on.

18:23.644 --> 18:26.939
-By "something big," you mean…
-The truth inside the Dream Base village.

18:28.732 --> 18:32.277
I'm sure it's horrific in there.
So that's what we need to expose.

18:33.195 --> 18:34.446
But that's impossible.

18:35.656 --> 18:37.032
That place is being guarded by soldiers.

18:38.408 --> 18:39.576
I'll be going in there alone.

18:41.286 --> 18:43.205
Where is the most heavily guarded area?

18:43.288 --> 18:46.458
That's probably
where they want to hide the most.

18:49.711 --> 18:52.089
That would be the Dream Base hospital.

18:52.172 --> 18:53.882
But to be honest with you,

18:53.966 --> 18:56.218
there may be a way in, but no way out.

18:56.301 --> 18:57.511
Will you still do it?

18:58.303 --> 18:59.429
Yes.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.140
Just let me in.

19:02.349 --> 19:05.811
All right. Let's say you get lucky
and manage to record something,

19:05.894 --> 19:07.646
but there's just no way to divulge it.

19:07.729 --> 19:09.731
The media is extremely wary
of the government right now

19:09.815 --> 19:12.609
and all media platforms including
social media have been blocked.

19:12.693 --> 19:13.694
This country…

19:14.862 --> 19:16.488
is not a free state anymore.

19:17.531 --> 19:18.657
I have something in mind

19:20.075 --> 19:21.493
about that.

19:23.495 --> 19:25.372
What's on your mind?

19:28.584 --> 19:30.085
Can you get me something first?

19:56.570 --> 19:57.738
<i>Elijah.</i>

19:59.281 --> 20:01.074
<i>There's something I want to tell you.</i>

20:02.951 --> 20:06.747
<i>A few days ago, I met someone
who used to work at the cathedral.</i>

20:08.540 --> 20:12.753
<i>The truth is, the fire started from
the power distribution board</i>

20:12.836 --> 20:14.713
<i>due to old electrical wiring.</i>

20:15.839 --> 20:17.883
<i>It was a simple accident,
and nobody's fault.</i>

20:20.469 --> 20:25.265
<i>Yet Yo-han
led you to suspect him on purpose.</i>

20:25.349 --> 20:28.310
Didn't you say you'd come after me
if you were to ever walk again?

20:28.393 --> 20:31.021
Take one step at a time. Slowly.

20:32.731 --> 20:37.736
<i>He purposely cancelled the MoU
for you to see</i>

20:37.819 --> 20:39.905
<i>and said things to provoke you.</i>

20:39.988 --> 20:42.908
I couldn't care less about those I killed.

20:44.743 --> 20:46.286
If I really killed them, that is.

20:48.789 --> 20:50.207
<i>Because…</i>

20:51.124 --> 20:54.086
<i>he saw you had too much of
a hard time after losing your parents.</i>

20:54.836 --> 20:59.466
<i>You wouldn't eat or sleep,
and would wither away, day by day.</i>

21:01.009 --> 21:04.846
<i>Yo-han had wanted you to live</i>

21:04.930 --> 21:06.640
<i>with the strength to hate him.</i>

21:08.600 --> 21:12.020
<i>But Elijah, even if you misunderstood him,</i>

21:13.230 --> 21:14.648
<i>it's not your fault.</i>

21:15.607 --> 21:17.985
<i>Because that's what Yo-han
had wanted for himself.</i>

21:19.027 --> 21:21.071
<i>You're not at fault, Elijah.</i>

21:22.739 --> 21:27.035
<i>Just be good to him
once you see him again.</i>

21:28.203 --> 21:31.665
<i>Because Yo-han will come back.</i>

21:32.332 --> 21:34.501
<i>It won't take long, I promise.</i>

21:40.924 --> 21:42.592
<i>So eat, even just a little.</i>

21:43.969 --> 21:47.764
<i>How would he feel to see you unwell
once he's returned?</i>

22:47.824 --> 22:49.201
Yo-han!

23:09.846 --> 23:13.517
You've been sentenced to death
and you can be executed at any minute

23:13.600 --> 23:16.478
-if that's what you wish.
-Please help…

23:16.561 --> 23:18.313
Is that all you can say?

23:20.023 --> 23:24.319
Help! Help!

23:53.348 --> 23:55.016
DREAM BASE FOODS

24:11.199 --> 24:15.078
FRAGILE

25:23.021 --> 25:28.735
CLINICAL TRIAL 3 IN PROGRESS

26:11.027 --> 26:11.945
Oh, my head…

27:12.422 --> 27:15.008
Ms. Han So-yoon. What happened?

27:17.177 --> 27:18.636
It's me, Kim Ga-on.

27:19.804 --> 27:22.515
Judge Kim, how did you get in here?

27:24.851 --> 27:25.852
Don't worry.

27:27.270 --> 27:28.730
Mr. President is here!

27:28.813 --> 27:30.065
Mr. President is here!

27:32.233 --> 27:34.069
I'll be back soon. Hold on.

27:44.746 --> 27:47.374
I'd like to commend the efforts

27:48.124 --> 27:50.293
of our medical staff.

27:51.127 --> 27:54.756
A clinical trial for the newest vaccine
commissioned by the EU is underway.

27:55.423 --> 27:58.343
The total number of participants is 3,620,

27:58.426 --> 28:02.639
and the number of deaths from
side-effects so far is 182.

28:02.722 --> 28:05.266
Total 182? That's not bad.

28:05.350 --> 28:07.310
Share the data with them

28:07.394 --> 28:10.563
and let me know if there are
any countries behind on payments.

28:10.647 --> 28:13.608
Oh, and we also received
additional requests

28:13.691 --> 28:16.444
from many countries
including Russia and Japan.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.738
We'll have to expand our farm then.

28:19.406 --> 28:22.117
With many countries in the race
for a vaccine,

28:22.200 --> 28:25.912
there's an explosive demand
for clinical trials, Mr. President.

28:28.123 --> 28:29.124
If Seoul isn't enough,

28:29.207 --> 28:33.253
we'll have to branch out to
Busan, Daegu and Gwangju.

28:33.336 --> 28:36.506
Since there's not a drop of oil
produced from this land,

28:36.589 --> 28:39.092
it's human resources
that we have to rely on.

28:41.886 --> 28:43.930
I've been telling you time and time again

28:44.013 --> 28:47.851
that it's the people that matter
the most, have I not?

28:48.351 --> 28:51.438
All these people here are all money.

28:51.521 --> 28:52.731
Those clinical trials?

28:52.814 --> 28:55.525
Do you know how much they are
bringing in per head? It's no joke!

28:55.608 --> 28:59.738
And if they should die,
we harvest everything we can from them!

29:00.321 --> 29:04.576
Oh, and their hair, blood,
and other by-products…

29:04.659 --> 29:06.828
We take everything and export them too.

29:06.911 --> 29:08.121
Waste?

29:08.204 --> 29:10.623
There's nothing that goes to waste!

29:52.624 --> 29:55.877
I didn't know you were such
a genius businessman, Mr. President.

29:55.960 --> 29:58.963
-You kept it from us!
-And you tried to hog this golden goose?

29:59.047 --> 30:00.423
Honestly, I'm disappointed!

30:00.507 --> 30:02.801
I was going to share this with you
in due time.

30:02.884 --> 30:05.762
But do we have to let Seon-a in this too?

30:09.224 --> 30:12.644
I'm not saying we should overthrow her.

30:19.067 --> 30:21.319
It won't hurt to have
one less mouth to feed.

30:21.402 --> 30:23.571
It's not like
she's particularly useful anymore.

30:24.739 --> 30:26.324
Both Gyeong-hui and Seon-a.

30:26.407 --> 30:28.827
Honestly, I just hate women
who are strong-minded!

30:28.910 --> 30:32.914
She's too smart for nothing,
that former maid.

30:32.997 --> 30:36.167
Right? Why not take
this chance to get rid of her too?

30:36.251 --> 30:38.294
And let's send someone
to the detention center

30:38.378 --> 30:41.589
to take care of Kang Yo-han for good
before he's up to something again.

30:42.257 --> 30:44.467
Yes, Mr. President!

30:45.301 --> 30:46.845
Oh, come on.

30:49.138 --> 30:50.265
You like that, do you?

30:55.979 --> 30:59.482
-Wait for me!
-We should get going too.

31:04.070 --> 31:05.572
So-yoon, let's get out of here.

31:10.702 --> 31:12.036
What are you doing?

31:15.248 --> 31:17.041
I received orders to check her vitals.

31:18.793 --> 31:20.211
Sure…

31:22.714 --> 31:23.631
Let's go.

31:49.032 --> 31:49.949
Wait.

31:51.200 --> 31:52.201
Yes?

31:56.122 --> 31:58.041
Don't be so nervous, Judge Kim.

32:05.298 --> 32:08.343
<i>I've actually been waiting
for someone to come here.</i>

32:08.426 --> 32:09.719
<i>And it's not just me either.</i>

32:09.802 --> 32:11.804
<i>All the staff are
practically held captive,</i>

32:11.888 --> 32:13.848
<i>and our cellphones confiscated.</i>

32:13.932 --> 32:16.476
There are still people in here
who are right-minded.

32:16.559 --> 32:18.144
<i>I mean, how could this be?</i>

32:18.227 --> 32:21.230
<i>How could the country do
such a thing to its people?</i>

32:22.732 --> 32:23.900
It's a dead body.

32:23.983 --> 32:26.444
All organs have been harvested
and it's ready for the incinerator.

32:32.492 --> 32:33.618
<i>We'll help you.</i>

32:34.202 --> 32:37.956
<i>We'll help you two to get out of here,
so please tell the world.</i>

32:39.332 --> 32:41.250
About what's going on in here.

32:42.752 --> 32:44.462
Yes, I promise.

32:57.308 --> 32:58.893
Are you all right, So-yoon?

33:08.069 --> 33:10.405
Yes, Judge Kim. Are you all right?

33:11.072 --> 33:15.243
Yes. I managed to save
Ms. Han So-yoon too. I was lucky.

33:18.454 --> 33:20.206
Did you get what I asked you?

33:21.582 --> 33:23.876
Is that really the only way?

33:24.961 --> 33:27.922
Maybe we should look for
a reporter who's brave enough to--

33:28.006 --> 33:30.883
That would be a risk.
We have no time for that.

33:33.386 --> 33:34.804
All right.

33:56.868 --> 34:02.040
CLINICAL TRIAL 3 IN PROGRESS

34:52.799 --> 34:55.468
You're a pretty little thing.
How old are you?

34:56.969 --> 34:58.679
Eighteen.

35:29.418 --> 35:31.921
What have I done?

35:43.724 --> 35:44.976
I'm sorry.

35:47.353 --> 35:48.771
I'm sorry.

35:52.608 --> 35:53.901
I'm sorry.

35:55.611 --> 35:58.072
I'm so sorry…

36:04.412 --> 36:06.455
I'm sorry…

36:16.841 --> 36:18.050
Judge Kim.

36:18.551 --> 36:20.970
So? Did you find a way?

36:22.013 --> 36:23.764
I have a favor to ask you, Judge Oh.

36:24.557 --> 36:26.350
Just tell me and I'll do it.

36:27.977 --> 36:30.897
Tomorrow is
Chief Justice Min's inauguration, right?

37:21.989 --> 37:24.116
Is that all you need me to do?

37:24.784 --> 37:27.745
Yes, that's all I ask.

37:28.996 --> 37:30.081
All right.

37:30.164 --> 37:33.417
But what are you planning
to do at the inauguration?

37:40.174 --> 37:42.134
BAD NEWS, JUDGE OH
TURN ON THE TV NOW

37:48.140 --> 37:49.183
<i>Breaking news.</i>

37:49.267 --> 37:52.979
<i>Judge Kang Yo-han, who was arrested
for abetting murder, has died.</i>

37:53.062 --> 37:55.439
<i>It is said that Judge Kang,
who was being detained</i>

37:55.523 --> 37:58.484
<i>at the Central Detention Center,
was attacked by an assailant.</i>

37:58.567 --> 38:01.904
<i>Judge Kang Yo-han was the first…</i>

38:20.965 --> 38:24.427
JUDGE KANG YO-HAN STABBED TO DEATH
BY UNIDENTIFIED ASSAILANT

38:39.650 --> 38:40.818
Seon-a.

38:45.281 --> 38:46.615
It's all right.

38:47.700 --> 38:49.076
I'm okay.

38:49.994 --> 38:52.496
He's someone I finished
with my own hands, anyway.

38:55.041 --> 38:56.250
It's for the better.

39:38.459 --> 39:42.213
I guess this really is the end then.

39:42.296 --> 39:45.591
We have the "The End" up on the screen,

39:45.674 --> 39:48.761
the end credits rolling,

39:48.844 --> 39:52.223
and finally, the lights come on.

39:52.306 --> 39:54.266
It's time to rise up and applaud.

39:56.102 --> 39:59.105
Gosh, looks like that
Kang Yo-han came to grow on me.

39:59.188 --> 40:01.774
I think I'll be thinking of him
from time to time, Mr. President.

40:01.857 --> 40:05.069
Should we hold a memorial rite
for him every year?

40:06.904 --> 40:09.657
With candles and incense
burning on the cake.

40:09.740 --> 40:12.827
We'll make meat cakes, and <i>japchae</i> too…

40:16.414 --> 40:19.250
Is something wrong?
Or something troubling you?

40:19.333 --> 40:20.584
Pardon?

40:23.671 --> 40:24.588
No way.

40:25.673 --> 40:30.094
I was just thinking about
all the trouble he'd put me through.

40:30.177 --> 40:32.513
We'd get so fed up, didn't we?

40:32.596 --> 40:36.392
Yes, it was awfully tiring.

40:36.475 --> 40:37.935
So it's time we send him off.

40:39.270 --> 40:41.105
So I was thinking…

40:41.856 --> 40:44.817
How about we arrange a little something?

40:44.900 --> 40:46.527
What is it this time?

40:48.571 --> 40:51.532
An event to celebrate
and remember Kang Yo-han.

40:52.408 --> 40:55.828
Isn't Chief Justice Min's
inauguration ceremony tomorrow?

40:58.038 --> 40:59.373
Yes, and?

40:59.457 --> 41:01.709
The stage is all yours now, Mr. President.

41:02.835 --> 41:06.213
So how about a toast to celebrate
with the key members of the Foundation?

41:06.964 --> 41:09.758
Right in that asshole's courtroom
who dared to challenge you,

41:11.177 --> 41:12.344
Mr. President.

41:16.891 --> 41:18.267
Geez, President Min.

41:18.350 --> 41:20.603
Are you nearing your grave?
This is unlike you.

41:23.022 --> 41:25.691
Actually, not a bad idea.

41:25.774 --> 41:28.903
Oh, and don't forget Jung Seon-a.

41:28.986 --> 41:30.821
Call her and make sure she comes.

41:30.905 --> 41:34.492
You know, I just can't get
a good night's sleep because of her.

41:34.575 --> 41:37.953
I mean, I understand you two.
But she just…

41:38.037 --> 41:39.830
I mean, how could she?

41:42.374 --> 41:47.213
We'll send her off at where her lover
used to play his court games.

41:51.717 --> 41:53.135
CHAIRWOMAN JUNG SEON-A

41:55.721 --> 41:58.933
<i>So I'm suggesting we have a drink,
just the three of us.</i>

42:01.727 --> 42:03.854
The stage is all yours now,
Chairwoman Jung.

42:03.938 --> 42:05.564
Isn't it time we have a female president?

42:07.775 --> 42:10.736
All right. I'll see you
at the Supreme Court then.

42:12.696 --> 42:13.948
All right.

42:28.212 --> 42:29.421
Jae-hee.

42:32.174 --> 42:33.634
Yes, Seon-a?

42:34.218 --> 42:35.970
Get me a pistol.

42:36.679 --> 42:39.223
One that'll fit right into my purse.

42:40.099 --> 42:41.183
But why?

42:42.268 --> 42:45.646
It looks like I'll be the next president.

42:48.107 --> 42:50.317
So it's time I protect myself.

42:52.403 --> 42:54.363
Good work until now.

43:02.037 --> 43:05.291
The age of madness is past us.

43:05.374 --> 43:09.628
Now it is time to restore
justice that has fallen.

43:09.712 --> 43:12.590
And I vow to become the Chief Justice

43:12.673 --> 43:16.010
who rebuilds our fallen judiciary

43:16.093 --> 43:19.054
starting with its foundation stone.

43:21.557 --> 43:22.850
Thank you.

43:23.434 --> 43:26.228
Chief Justice, may we ask
why you chose to opt

43:26.312 --> 43:29.732
for a press conference
and not an official ceremony?

43:29.815 --> 43:32.192
We are still in a state
of emergency, are we not?

43:32.276 --> 43:35.613
I think this is no time to
focus on my personal honor.

43:35.696 --> 43:37.364
I hope you will understand.

43:37.448 --> 43:38.657
Thank you.

43:38.741 --> 43:40.576
What are your next steps?

43:47.833 --> 43:48.959
Chief Justice.

43:50.711 --> 43:53.213
-Congratulations.
-Hey, Judge Oh.

43:53.881 --> 43:54.882
Thank you.

43:55.674 --> 43:58.636
During the press conference just now,

44:01.722 --> 44:04.683
Chairwoman Jung Seon-a asked me
to relay to you

44:04.767 --> 44:06.810
that she'd like to meet
with you in private.

44:08.270 --> 44:11.565
-Really?
-She said she'll be waiting for you

44:11.649 --> 44:13.567
at your old office since it's empty.

44:17.488 --> 44:18.656
All right.

44:29.541 --> 44:32.378
<i>Yes, Judge Kim. I just told him.</i>

44:32.461 --> 44:34.004
Thank you, Judge Oh.

44:34.713 --> 44:38.676
<i>-Now please leave the building.</i>
-What? Leave the building?

44:38.759 --> 44:40.886
<i>-Why?</i>
-I'll explain later.

44:41.553 --> 44:43.639
<i>But for now, please do as I ask.</i>

44:44.306 --> 44:45.432
All right.

44:50.938 --> 44:54.691
Wow, this place has amazing interiors.

44:54.775 --> 44:57.903
Wow, what killer views.

44:57.986 --> 44:59.780
It's like you're all at my feet.

45:01.532 --> 45:04.034
Is that why that Kang Yo-han

45:04.118 --> 45:06.578
was such an arrogant asshole?

45:14.461 --> 45:18.006
Gosh! Chairwoman Jung,
seeing you up there is amazing.

45:18.090 --> 45:19.758
You just shine.

45:19.842 --> 45:22.511
You just ooze this aura!

45:22.594 --> 45:23.720
I agree.

45:23.804 --> 45:27.641
Why don't we hold
all of our important events here?

45:29.059 --> 45:31.228
Our ladies know something
about stage setting,

45:31.311 --> 45:33.063
being from elite families.

45:33.147 --> 45:36.024
-Of course, we're the experts.
-Oh, I know nothing.

45:36.692 --> 45:37.901
Honey!

45:39.319 --> 45:41.488
-Goodness.
-You can't even climb up here?

45:41.572 --> 45:42.531
Help.

45:53.333 --> 45:54.543
Ga-on.

45:54.626 --> 45:56.462
Ga-on, why are you doing this?

46:12.186 --> 46:14.229
Come with me, Professor.

46:28.535 --> 46:29.495
Ga-on…

46:35.459 --> 46:38.670
There were no media companies
conscientious enough to report the truth.

46:38.754 --> 46:42.925
But it'll be different if it's something
sensational that's worth money.

46:43.008 --> 46:47.054
Like the story of the new Chief Justice
who died with his old mentee

46:47.137 --> 46:49.348
in a terrorist attack
on his inauguration day.

46:51.600 --> 46:52.851
Once the bomb goes off,

46:53.685 --> 46:56.772
all major media companies
will receive an email from me.

46:57.689 --> 46:59.942
About the truth behind
the Dream Base project.

47:01.026 --> 47:03.403
They won't be able to ignore it this time.

47:09.117 --> 47:10.369
Consider this

47:12.287 --> 47:14.248
your atonement for Su-hyeon's death.

47:16.583 --> 47:19.127
If you still have conscience left.

47:54.538 --> 47:55.831
Am I too late?

47:56.540 --> 47:58.083
It was a long trip from hell.

47:59.710 --> 48:00.586
Judge Kang.

48:15.767 --> 48:17.311
You're alive.

48:17.394 --> 48:19.229
Thank goodness.

48:22.399 --> 48:23.650
What happened?

48:28.905 --> 48:32.409
Now you're nothing but a rat in my grasp.
Did you hear me?

48:34.578 --> 48:35.787
So, Warden.

48:37.706 --> 48:39.958
How was the weather in the Bahamas?

48:42.294 --> 48:43.670
What are you on about?

48:44.421 --> 48:48.383
The 12 billion you grubbed
over these past 30 years

48:48.467 --> 48:50.927
through all kinds of
crimes and corruption.

48:51.845 --> 48:54.348
I know you stashed it away in
your secret account in the Bahamas

48:54.431 --> 48:55.849
while on your trip last summer.

48:57.392 --> 48:58.477
How did you…

48:59.853 --> 49:00.771
Sit.

49:03.190 --> 49:04.274
I said, sit down.

49:08.528 --> 49:11.615
You think it's a coincidence
you ended up here without being fired?

49:12.199 --> 49:14.117
You're my insurance

49:15.410 --> 49:16.828
in case things turned sour.

49:17.704 --> 49:18.955
Go ahead and check

49:19.956 --> 49:22.167
because that money is not there anymore.

49:29.716 --> 49:31.635
Judge Kang, please help.

49:32.344 --> 49:33.887
That money is my everything.

49:34.554 --> 49:35.555
What do you want?

49:36.348 --> 49:38.266
What should I do for you?

49:39.101 --> 49:40.352
Your specialty.

49:41.186 --> 49:43.772
-Pardon?
-Switching prisoners.

49:46.983 --> 49:51.571
But you're such a celebrity that
there's no way not to get busted.

49:51.655 --> 49:53.949
Who says it needs to be a secret forever?

49:54.950 --> 49:56.201
Just 24 hours.

49:57.035 --> 50:00.997
I need just 24 hours, no more and no less.
Then I'll give your money back to you.

50:02.874 --> 50:04.376
Do you mean it?

51:03.769 --> 51:06.021
That was a cheeky thing
that you did, Warden.

51:06.104 --> 51:08.482
No, sir. It wasn't me.

51:08.565 --> 51:11.485
It was that guy from the Blue House.

51:11.568 --> 51:13.987
Although he wasn't part of the plan,
good timing.

51:15.864 --> 51:17.991
Now you have a body to switch me with.

51:18.074 --> 51:19.075
Right?

51:20.202 --> 51:21.328
Yes.

51:24.623 --> 51:26.041
You mean you had a plan?

51:26.541 --> 51:29.419
-To escape, all on your own?
-No way.

51:32.464 --> 51:33.715
I'm sorry, Judge Kim.

51:34.382 --> 51:35.467
Mr. Go?

51:36.802 --> 51:39.054
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you beforehand.

51:39.137 --> 51:43.099
I wasn't sure
whether I could trust you 100 percent.

51:46.645 --> 51:50.649
So you got out with the help of that jerk
who sneaked out Do Young-choon?

51:50.732 --> 51:53.318
Then did you give him his money back too?

51:54.027 --> 51:55.654
I did.

51:55.737 --> 51:58.114
But with love.

51:58.198 --> 51:59.366
WARDEN'S OFFICE

52:13.964 --> 52:15.841
THANK YOU FOR SPONSORING US

52:15.924 --> 52:18.134
THANK YOU FOR YOUR DONATION

52:21.596 --> 52:23.765
Kang Yo-han, that bastard!

52:28.436 --> 52:29.521
What will you do now?

52:31.147 --> 52:32.858
He'll need to pay for his sin.

52:34.317 --> 52:35.986
A life for a life.

52:39.948 --> 52:44.077
But please let me deal with Min Jeong-ho.

52:52.419 --> 52:53.587
Let's go.

53:04.806 --> 53:06.057
Cheers!

53:06.141 --> 53:07.767
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

53:07.851 --> 53:10.353
-That's too high!
-He's such a tease.

53:10.437 --> 53:11.771
He's a funny one.

53:16.526 --> 53:17.611
What?

53:18.320 --> 53:19.321
What is it?

53:20.113 --> 53:21.323
What is this?

53:22.866 --> 53:25.035
Is there an event today?

53:25.911 --> 53:27.537
Did someone prepare this?AA

53:28.330 --> 53:30.373
Something's not right.

53:31.541 --> 53:33.126
Not me.

53:35.962 --> 53:37.047
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

53:38.340 --> 53:41.635
Here's to Kang Yo-han, who's up in heaven.

53:42.928 --> 53:45.263
<i>Isn't this nice?</i>

53:46.056 --> 53:50.518
<i>I'm filled with emotions to see
everyone here in one place.</i>

53:50.602 --> 53:52.228
I've missed you too, Mr. Kang.

53:53.355 --> 53:55.315
<i>Thanks for your heart, President Park.</i>

53:55.398 --> 53:56.691
Oh what?

53:57.901 --> 53:59.277
<i>So he was alive.</i>

53:59.986 --> 54:02.072
Is this a live show?

54:03.239 --> 54:04.616
But he's dead!

54:05.617 --> 54:07.452
Just what prank are you trying to pull?

54:07.535 --> 54:09.829
Prank? I'm disappointed
to hear you say that

54:09.913 --> 54:11.665
when this is a sacred trial.

54:12.540 --> 54:14.834
Trial? What's he talking about?

54:14.918 --> 54:17.587
You blocked the newspapers,
the media and the Internet too,

54:18.171 --> 54:20.215
but I'm sure there's something you missed.

54:21.007 --> 54:22.300
Hold on.

54:24.844 --> 54:25.929
The Dike app!

54:28.890 --> 54:30.642
Now let's begin the live show.

54:33.937 --> 54:38.441
My fellow Koreans,
your final court is now in session.

54:44.906 --> 54:46.950
THE FINAL COURT IS NOW IN SESSION

54:47.033 --> 54:50.578
<i>LIVE COURT SHOW</i>
THE FINAL COURT IS NOW IN SESSION

55:00.714 --> 55:03.508
Let me introduce today's participants.

55:04.884 --> 55:07.637
Park Du-man, President of People Media

55:09.472 --> 55:11.850
<i>Pi Hyang-mi, CFO
of Human Media Broadcasting Network.</i>

55:11.933 --> 55:13.101
-No way.
-No…

55:13.184 --> 55:15.061
<i>Kim Sang-sook, Director of Minbo Group.</i>

55:16.521 --> 55:18.565
<i>Min Yong-sik, President of Minbo Group.</i>

55:23.069 --> 55:25.447
<i>Do Youn-jeong,
First Lady of the Republic of Korea.</i>

55:26.364 --> 55:28.616
<i>Heo Joong-se,
President of the Republic of Korea.</i>

55:28.700 --> 55:29.784
What? Me too?

55:32.746 --> 55:34.748
They are the people
who control this country.

55:35.248 --> 55:36.624
Honey.

55:36.708 --> 55:39.544
-Why is there no signal?
-Honey, is it working?

55:39.627 --> 55:40.879
There's no signal.

55:43.006 --> 55:46.009
This is an act of terror
against the head of state!

55:46.092 --> 55:47.385
A crime!

55:47.469 --> 55:50.180
Yes, that's right. It's a crime.
I'm a criminal.

55:50.263 --> 55:54.059
But what about you?
Aren't you a criminal too?

55:54.142 --> 55:55.268
Mr. President?

55:56.061 --> 56:00.648
FOOTAGES FROM INSIDE
THE DREAM BASE HOSPITAL

56:04.319 --> 56:06.112
FOOTAGES FROM INSIDE
THE DREAM BASE HOSPITAL

56:11.159 --> 56:14.829
Fellow Koreans, this is the truth
behind the Dream Base project.

56:16.122 --> 56:19.084
You'd been scheming this
behind me, weren't you?

56:19.751 --> 56:20.627
You knew?

56:23.630 --> 56:24.672
You psycho wench…

56:24.756 --> 56:25.715
<i>Isn't it astounding?</i>

56:26.299 --> 56:28.760
<i>Using the virus
that doesn't even exist as an excuse</i>

56:28.843 --> 56:31.012
to drag people away and sell them
off for human experiments.

56:34.140 --> 56:37.143
Only one creative psycho
could have come up with that.

56:37.227 --> 56:40.313
-This is all manipulated.
-I truly admire you, Mr. President.

56:40.396 --> 56:42.565
You're all being deceived. Hold on.

56:42.649 --> 56:45.401
My fellow Koreans
whom I deeply love and respect,

56:45.485 --> 56:49.072
all these videos are manipulated!
This is an anti-government movement

56:49.155 --> 56:51.407
to try and overthrow
the current government…

56:51.491 --> 56:53.535
<i>I've been telling you time and time again</i>

56:53.618 --> 56:56.371
<i>that it's the people that matter
the most, have I not?</i>

56:56.454 --> 56:59.666
<i>All these people here are all money.</i>

56:59.749 --> 57:01.251
<i>Those clinical trials?</i>

57:01.334 --> 57:03.837
<i>Do you know how much they are
bringing in per head? It's no joke!</i>

57:03.920 --> 57:07.132
<i>And if they should die,
we harvest everything we can from them!</i>

57:07.215 --> 57:11.636
<i>Oh, and their hair, blood,
and other by-products…</i>

57:11.719 --> 57:15.014
<i>We take everything and export them too.</i>

57:15.098 --> 57:17.559
<i>Waste? There's nothing that goes to waste!</i>

57:19.644 --> 57:21.354
<i>The cameras sure love you.</i>

57:21.438 --> 57:22.564
I can see why you were an actor.

57:30.864 --> 57:33.241
And these are the people
who died at the hands of Jung Seon-a,

57:33.324 --> 57:35.660
Chairwoman of
the Social Responsibility Foundation.

57:37.245 --> 57:38.705
Driven by her ambition,

57:42.083 --> 57:43.835
<i>she attacked me</i>

57:52.886 --> 57:54.888
and killed the innocent.

58:01.352 --> 58:04.564
And Min Jeong-ho, who was
appointed Chief Justice today

58:04.647 --> 58:08.443
is a hypocrite who acted as cat's paw
for Jung Seon-a, out of his own good.

58:09.277 --> 58:12.697
<i>He betrayed Inspector Yoon Su-hyeon
who was like a daughter to him,</i>

58:12.780 --> 58:16.117
and joined hands with Jung Seon-a
who killed her.

58:20.747 --> 58:22.624
Isn't it amazing?

58:52.403 --> 58:53.446
Now go…

59:01.955 --> 59:03.623
and live forever in hell.

59:05.500 --> 59:07.460
Your name will go down in history

59:09.087 --> 59:10.713
just as you wished.

59:58.928 --> 1:00:00.179
My fellow Koreans,

1:00:00.930 --> 1:00:02.307
are they guilty?

1:00:14.652 --> 1:00:20.491
INNOCENT, GUILTY

1:00:24.662 --> 1:00:27.040
But that's not fair! We're innocent.

1:00:28.041 --> 1:00:30.335
I guess we'll need
a fair punishment for them.

1:00:33.338 --> 1:00:34.964
What is that?

1:00:35.048 --> 1:00:36.549
Is that here?

1:00:36.633 --> 1:00:39.218
-What is that?
-What is that, Honey?

1:00:39.302 --> 1:00:41.763
<i>The moment you try and escape from here,</i>

1:00:41.846 --> 1:00:43.348
this bomb will go off.

1:00:44.223 --> 1:00:45.642
-He says it's a bomb!
-Go check.

1:00:45.725 --> 1:00:47.477
Honey!

1:00:54.734 --> 1:00:56.069
It's really here!

1:00:58.446 --> 1:01:01.616
Fellow Koreans, now you be the judge.

1:01:01.699 --> 1:01:04.952
I remember our President had
polled 10 million votes.

1:01:05.578 --> 1:01:09.123
The moment the number of votes
counted on Dike app reaches that number,

1:01:09.207 --> 1:01:12.043
you'll see a most grandiose firework show.

1:01:12.126 --> 1:01:14.337
To celebrate the victory of democracy.

1:01:18.341 --> 1:01:24.889
NO. OF PARTICIPANTS

1:02:01.634 --> 1:02:05.054
NO. OF PARTICIPANTS

1:02:08.349 --> 1:02:09.475
I'll be leaving now.

1:02:10.518 --> 1:02:11.894
Where to, Judge Kang?

1:02:15.398 --> 1:02:16.816
To the stage.

1:02:22.405 --> 1:02:25.032
The left door, facing the law school.

1:02:30.204 --> 1:02:32.081
The left door, facing the law school.

1:02:39.797 --> 1:02:41.424
Kang Yo-han, that bastard!

1:02:41.507 --> 1:02:43.134
Honey.

1:02:43.926 --> 1:02:45.595
It won't open?

1:02:46.345 --> 1:02:47.263
It won't.

1:02:51.350 --> 1:02:52.393
Honey.

1:02:55.271 --> 1:02:57.482
Oh, my…

1:02:58.316 --> 1:02:59.817
-Kang Yo-han!
-Oh, my.

1:03:03.780 --> 1:03:05.281
Take one more step,

1:03:06.407 --> 1:03:08.534
and I'll blow this place away.

1:03:23.132 --> 1:03:24.509
My fellow Koreans,

1:03:25.968 --> 1:03:28.429
the footages of
the Dream Base Hospital you just saw

1:03:29.138 --> 1:03:31.891
were filmed by Judge Kim Ga-on,
who risked his life to do so.

1:03:33.184 --> 1:03:34.977
<i>Once all of this is over,</i>

1:03:35.061 --> 1:03:38.856
<i>Judge Kim will testify the truth.</i>

1:03:39.774 --> 1:03:40.983
<i>As for the villains here,</i>

1:03:41.901 --> 1:03:44.153
they will be going to hell with me.

1:03:48.074 --> 1:03:49.492
No…

1:03:51.869 --> 1:03:52.912
Honey!

1:03:57.416 --> 1:04:00.378
Judge Kang. You ought to spare me.

1:04:02.088 --> 1:04:04.173
Didn't I do as you ordered?

1:04:05.341 --> 1:04:07.468
I brought them all here, didn't I?

1:04:20.273 --> 1:04:22.859
-Hello?
<i>-It's been a long time, President Min.</i>

1:04:24.610 --> 1:04:26.863
How did you call me?

1:04:26.946 --> 1:04:30.700
There's no time, so listen up.
I need you to do something for me.

1:04:30.783 --> 1:04:32.702
On the day of Min Jeong-ho's inauguration,

1:04:32.785 --> 1:04:35.746
have everyone at the Foundation
gather in the courtroom.

1:04:35.830 --> 1:04:37.039
<i>What?</i>

1:04:37.123 --> 1:04:38.624
What crazy nonsense…

1:04:38.708 --> 1:04:40.793
<i>Otherwise you'll die.</i>

1:04:40.877 --> 1:04:44.255
I have the evidence that you laid
your hands on the SRF's funds

1:04:45.590 --> 1:04:48.384
-to save Minbo Group from bankruptcy.
-Don't lie to me.

1:04:48.467 --> 1:04:50.553
If you can't believe me,
open the drawers under your desk.

1:04:51.220 --> 1:04:52.722
I put a copy in there.

1:04:53.848 --> 1:04:56.100
<i>So you dared to rob from them.</i>

1:04:58.769 --> 1:04:59.937
Help me.

1:05:00.605 --> 1:05:03.858
<i>-If they find out, I'm dead!</i>
-If you want to live, do as I say.

1:05:03.941 --> 1:05:05.026
Right now!

1:05:06.319 --> 1:05:08.529
You trashy bastard…

1:05:09.614 --> 1:05:11.908
You crazy bastard!

1:05:11.991 --> 1:05:13.451
Let go of me!

1:05:13.534 --> 1:05:14.911
How dare you!

1:05:17.413 --> 1:05:19.123
You psycho clown.

1:05:21.167 --> 1:05:22.376
You need to spare me.

1:05:23.210 --> 1:05:24.712
You need to spare me!

1:05:28.883 --> 1:05:32.595
All right, I'll at least give you
a chance since you traded with me.

1:05:38.935 --> 1:05:41.938
-The door's open.
-The door's open!

1:05:46.734 --> 1:05:47.860
Wouldn't you say

1:05:51.113 --> 1:05:53.324
this is a deja vu?

1:05:57.370 --> 1:05:59.705
Just like that time
at the cathedral ten years ago?

1:06:02.667 --> 1:06:04.251
Now run for your life.

1:06:04.919 --> 1:06:07.421
I'll take one, first-come, first-served.

1:06:20.726 --> 1:06:23.813
<i>I'll take one, first-come, first-served.</i>

1:06:44.333 --> 1:06:45.418
No!

1:08:44.870 --> 1:08:45.996
Yo-han…

1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:51.168
Yi-sak.

1:09:32.543 --> 1:09:33.544
Honey!

1:09:33.627 --> 1:09:37.047
-Hey, you bastard!
-Wait… Just be quiet!

1:09:37.131 --> 1:09:39.842
Wait, Kang Yo-han.

1:09:39.925 --> 1:09:42.344
How about we strike a deal?

1:09:42.428 --> 1:09:44.847
Quiet, all of you! Attention!

1:09:46.974 --> 1:09:48.184
Kang Yo-han.

1:09:50.352 --> 1:09:51.896
All you need to do is save me, all right?

1:09:51.979 --> 1:09:55.149
I'm the Chief of State!
It'll be a win-win deal for us!

1:09:55.733 --> 1:09:58.903
These guys are businessmen and women!

1:10:00.571 --> 1:10:02.448
But I'm different from them.

1:10:02.531 --> 1:10:04.491
What will this country do without me?

1:10:04.575 --> 1:10:06.493
I'm the Republic of Korea!

1:10:06.577 --> 1:10:09.788
I'm an artist and a leader.

1:10:09.872 --> 1:10:11.874
So please spare me this once.

1:10:11.957 --> 1:10:14.168
And this country too! Please!

1:10:14.251 --> 1:10:16.712
I… I'm the king, aren't I?

1:10:16.795 --> 1:10:18.714
Please! I'm the king!

1:10:18.797 --> 1:10:22.301
I'm the king, aren't I?

1:10:38.901 --> 1:10:42.321
Damn it, he's awfully loud.

1:11:06.470 --> 1:11:08.931
Shoot… Shoot him!

1:11:09.014 --> 1:11:10.975
Shoot!

1:11:11.058 --> 1:11:14.186
-Shoot him!
-Please shoot!

1:11:14.270 --> 1:11:15.688
Shoot him!

1:11:15.771 --> 1:11:17.815
You can do it, shoot him.

1:11:18.482 --> 1:11:19.358
Shoot him!

1:11:21.318 --> 1:11:23.195
So it comes down to us in the end, is it?

1:11:34.123 --> 1:11:36.333
Come with me, Seon-a.

1:12:07.531 --> 1:12:10.367
Goodbye, Young Master.

1:12:24.089 --> 1:12:27.801
Shit, just fuck this all.

1:13:36.537 --> 1:13:37.788
It's all right, Seon-a.

1:13:38.705 --> 1:13:39.748
It's okay.

1:13:55.472 --> 1:13:56.557
<i>Did you know?</i>

1:14:00.436 --> 1:14:05.065
<i>I really did love you, Young Master.</i>

1:14:44.104 --> 1:14:47.399
Please spare us, Judge Kang.

1:14:47.483 --> 1:14:49.067
Please spare us!

1:14:49.151 --> 1:14:52.613
Please spare us. Please…

1:14:52.696 --> 1:14:54.323
We're sorry.

1:14:57.075 --> 1:14:58.368
Judge Kang.

1:15:02.414 --> 1:15:03.665
Don't move.

1:15:04.458 --> 1:15:06.293
Why did you come here?

1:15:12.966 --> 1:15:14.343
You can't.

1:15:18.889 --> 1:15:20.849
Are you going to leave Elijah
to join them?

1:15:21.767 --> 1:15:23.268
With those trashy bastards?

1:15:28.649 --> 1:15:29.566
I can't help it.

1:15:30.400 --> 1:15:33.237
Once the show is over,
actors need to disappear from the stage.

1:16:11.024 --> 1:16:15.320
NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS

1:16:20.158 --> 1:16:21.535
I'm coming with you then.

1:16:32.004 --> 1:16:33.630
You will be a hero.

1:16:35.507 --> 1:16:36.758
As for the devil,

1:16:38.135 --> 1:16:39.344
one is enough.

1:16:47.644 --> 1:16:49.187
Judge Kang.

1:16:49.855 --> 1:16:51.356
Judge Kang.

1:16:57.821 --> 1:16:59.615
Judge Kang!

1:17:11.752 --> 1:17:13.962
-Judge Kang! Kang Yo-han!
-It's dangerous!

1:17:26.558 --> 1:17:28.727
-Judge Kang.
-We're sorry.

1:17:28.810 --> 1:17:31.063
Don't do it!

1:17:40.614 --> 1:17:42.532
Kang Yo-han!

1:19:07.409 --> 1:19:11.872
No!

1:19:32.934 --> 1:19:34.728
Judge Kim, are you all right?

1:19:36.521 --> 1:19:37.814
The ambulance is here.

1:19:38.648 --> 1:19:40.650
Let's go. Do you think you can stand up?

1:20:25.403 --> 1:20:26.530
Elijah.

1:20:30.784 --> 1:20:31.827
Elijah?

1:20:59.145 --> 1:21:00.272
How about this one?

1:21:15.954 --> 1:21:17.122
Are you all right?

1:21:35.932 --> 1:21:37.893
You thought I'd really topple it, did you?

1:21:49.738 --> 1:21:52.240
BLUEPRINT

1:21:54.242 --> 1:21:57.787
SECURE EMERGENCY EXIT
HOW MUCH TIME IS AVAILABLE?

1:22:00.832 --> 1:22:04.002
MUST CHECKLIST

1:22:04.085 --> 1:22:08.048
CHECK DOUBLE LOCKS
CHECK DISTANCE

1:22:11.259 --> 1:22:13.887
<i>What is concentrated is easy to topple.</i>

1:22:15.388 --> 1:22:18.683
<i>Once the show is over,
the magician must disappear.</i>

1:22:25.106 --> 1:22:26.691
<i>I'm done cleaning up,</i>

1:22:28.109 --> 1:22:30.403
<i>and I believe there's now work
for you to do.</i>

1:22:36.993 --> 1:22:38.370
Ma'am.

1:22:38.954 --> 1:22:41.957
Master Yo-han dropped by.

1:22:43.333 --> 1:22:46.044
What happened? And where is Elijah?

1:22:47.587 --> 1:22:49.005
You see…

1:22:56.846 --> 1:22:58.181
Young Master!

1:22:59.265 --> 1:23:01.101
Young Master, you were alive!

1:23:01.184 --> 1:23:04.145
-Were you worried about me?
-Of course, do you need to ask?

1:23:04.938 --> 1:23:06.064
Listen.

1:23:06.606 --> 1:23:08.817
-You're fired as of today.
-Pardon?

1:23:09.484 --> 1:23:11.152
Leave this house and live your life.

1:23:11.236 --> 1:23:13.405
There won't be anyone here anymore.

1:23:13.488 --> 1:23:15.281
What do you mean, exactly?

1:23:18.785 --> 1:23:20.036
Young Master?

1:23:28.086 --> 1:23:30.714
-Elijah is in her room, is she?
-Yes.

1:23:31.923 --> 1:23:33.425
Young Master.

1:23:52.777 --> 1:23:53.945
Elijah.

1:24:02.454 --> 1:24:03.788
Yo-han.

1:24:16.634 --> 1:24:18.428
Are you out of prison now?

1:24:19.137 --> 1:24:20.221
Are you okay?

1:24:21.264 --> 1:24:24.601
Yes, you don't need to
worry anymore. I'm fine.

1:24:26.811 --> 1:24:28.521
We'll be going somewhere safe now.

1:24:30.148 --> 1:24:31.274
Somewhere safe?

1:24:31.858 --> 1:24:33.318
Should I show you where?

1:24:39.574 --> 1:24:41.534
It's a rehabilitation clinic
in Switzerland.

1:24:43.661 --> 1:24:48.041
I've been making donations
to find a way for you to walk again.

1:24:55.632 --> 1:24:56.883
Should we go here?

1:24:58.968 --> 1:25:00.470
Just the two of us?

1:25:03.223 --> 1:25:04.974
Yo-han.

1:25:40.593 --> 1:25:42.011
So he's alive.

1:25:44.305 --> 1:25:45.306
Thank goodness.

1:25:47.809 --> 1:25:51.563
But it looks like
I'll be busier from now on.

1:25:52.272 --> 1:25:53.273
Pardon?

1:25:53.356 --> 1:25:56.943
Young Master set up a health foods
e-commerce business for me,

1:25:57.026 --> 1:25:58.653
telling me it's my severance pay.

1:26:00.822 --> 1:26:04.242
He told me to sell lots of
healthy and not so tasty foods.

1:26:05.535 --> 1:26:07.162
Is he dissing me or what?

1:26:15.753 --> 1:26:17.505
<i>Are you really going back
to your hometown?</i>

1:26:17.589 --> 1:26:21.801
Yes, it'll be unfair to let just
Seoul have a taste of my charisma.

1:26:22.510 --> 1:26:26.723
-That's true.
-I volunteered for the Youth Court.

1:26:27.473 --> 1:26:30.602
I thought maybe I could lecture
and help troublemakers.

1:26:31.269 --> 1:26:34.397
-I thought I'd be pretty good at it.
-I'm sure you'll be.

1:26:34.480 --> 1:26:35.940
As always.

1:26:38.443 --> 1:26:39.861
Thank you for all your work.

1:26:41.529 --> 1:26:43.031
Same to you too.

1:26:43.114 --> 1:26:45.116
Call me if you're ever in the area.

1:27:00.423 --> 1:27:04.052
PUBLIC HEARING ON JUDICIAL REFORMS
FOLLOWING THE KANG YO-HAN CASE

1:27:07.889 --> 1:27:09.682
We, the new ruling party,

1:27:09.766 --> 1:27:14.020
vow to never repeat the mistakes
made by the Heo Joong-se government.

1:27:14.771 --> 1:27:17.232
So to restore the rule of law,

1:27:17.315 --> 1:27:19.567
I've invited all of you here today.

1:27:21.069 --> 1:27:23.446
First and foremost,
let's give a big hand to

1:27:24.030 --> 1:27:26.991
Judge Kim Ga-on, our national hero!

1:27:40.672 --> 1:27:45.635
Judge Kim,
what can we possibly do to prevent

1:27:46.636 --> 1:27:49.347
the disgraceful case of Kang Yo-han?

1:27:51.683 --> 1:27:53.268
Was that a disgraceful case?

1:27:54.936 --> 1:27:58.982
Kang Yo-han is not a hero,
but neither is he a criminal.

1:27:59.649 --> 1:28:02.860
Do you really think
our people raved about him

1:28:02.944 --> 1:28:05.196
because they are foolish
and are easily swayed?

1:28:07.198 --> 1:28:10.076
Is it because you're still young?
You sure are hot-blooded.

1:28:11.244 --> 1:28:14.747
In other words, you're suggesting
we need to address the root cause,

1:28:14.831 --> 1:28:16.040
but of course
we can't reach in short term.

1:28:18.042 --> 1:28:20.545
First we need to announce a measure

1:28:20.628 --> 1:28:22.839
that has an impact
to appease the angry citizens.

1:28:23.923 --> 1:28:25.675
I agree, Assemblyman.

1:28:25.758 --> 1:28:29.220
The Prosecution proposes
the rights of judicial appointment

1:28:29.304 --> 1:28:32.098
to the Ministry of Justice
to reinforce the nomination process

1:28:32.181 --> 1:28:35.435
and to filter out possible terrorists
like Kang Yo-han--

1:28:35.518 --> 1:28:37.228
That's nonsense!

1:28:37.312 --> 1:28:39.272
It'll be violating
our judicial independence.

1:28:39.355 --> 1:28:41.316
Assemblyman, rather than that,

1:28:41.399 --> 1:28:44.402
I propose newly launching
the Department of Live Court Show

1:28:44.485 --> 1:28:48.406
with Judge Kim Ga-on who's popular
as the new presiding--

1:28:48.489 --> 1:28:49.574
If you have time for this…

1:28:51.909 --> 1:28:53.369
Pardon?

1:28:53.453 --> 1:28:55.621
Shouldn't we rather focus on
what we need to do?

1:28:58.333 --> 1:28:59.584
I apologize.

1:29:00.209 --> 1:29:02.045
Please excuse my arrogance,

1:29:02.128 --> 1:29:04.714
but I must say this in front of
all my mentors. Please forgive me.

1:29:10.720 --> 1:29:11.929
We are all here

1:29:12.597 --> 1:29:15.725
to do our duties bestowed upon us
by our people, who is the sovereign.

1:29:16.476 --> 1:29:18.102
We must ensure no one is wronged,

1:29:18.978 --> 1:29:21.606
and that no one sheds tears of blood.

1:29:21.689 --> 1:29:26.194
We must also ensure those who make others
cry tears of blood is rightfully punished.

1:29:27.236 --> 1:29:28.571
Is that not our duty?

1:29:29.947 --> 1:29:31.949
That is why I'm in my judge's robe.

1:29:35.286 --> 1:29:38.915
If we fail to neglect our duties,
someone out there will suffer.

1:29:38.998 --> 1:29:40.291
And their suffering

1:29:41.709 --> 1:29:43.336
is what breeds monsters.

1:29:45.171 --> 1:29:47.048
There is a reason

1:29:47.965 --> 1:29:49.425
why people are enraged.

1:29:51.803 --> 1:29:54.180
Those are great words.

1:29:54.263 --> 1:29:57.016
We need our young talents
to be firm and resolute.

1:29:57.100 --> 1:29:58.392
I respect your views.

1:29:59.977 --> 1:30:01.938
Now that we've heard from Judge Kim,

1:30:02.021 --> 1:30:05.817
how about we now start discussing
the practical matters, Chairman?

1:30:05.900 --> 1:30:06.901
Yes, let's do that.

1:30:06.984 --> 1:30:09.987
You just mentioned the nomination process…

1:30:24.168 --> 1:30:25.419
<i>It's still the same.</i>

1:30:27.004 --> 1:30:28.798
<i>Nothing has changed after all.</i>

1:30:33.719 --> 1:30:35.388
<i>What should I do now</i>

1:30:37.098 --> 1:30:39.267
<i>for a world that doesn't need Yo-han?</i>

1:30:51.487 --> 1:30:52.697
Do a good job.

1:30:54.907 --> 1:30:56.742
Otherwise I'll be back.

1:31:50.213 --> 1:31:51.339
Judge Kang.

1:32:22.828 --> 1:32:23.996
Kang Yo-han!

1:34:14.607 --> 1:34:18.819
THANK YOU TO PARK HYOUNG-SOO
FOR HIS SPECIAL APPEARANCE

1:35:14.625 --> 1:35:18.337
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING <i>THE DEVIL JUDGE</i>

1:35:18.921 --> 1:35:23.717
