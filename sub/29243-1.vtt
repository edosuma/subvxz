00:52.887 --> 00:53.887
Run!

00:55.423 --> 00:56.555
Keep running!

00:58.993 --> 01:00.325
Run!

01:26.887 --> 01:27.887
No!

01:31.292 --> 01:32.958
Something on your mind, Anton?

01:35.129 --> 01:37.796
Excellent, thank god.

01:39.733 --> 01:42.534
You have no idea how
important this memorandum is.

01:45.473 --> 01:48.574
It is essential to the
future of this company.

01:50.411 --> 01:53.078
You must tell me
how you found it.

02:00.488 --> 02:01.488
No big deal.

02:05.059 --> 02:06.425
With the evidence at hand.

02:07.361 --> 02:09.661
Hmm, you may look like a,

02:11.298 --> 02:14.733
an overgrown
adolescent, but you have

02:16.237 --> 02:17.536
something special.

02:19.740 --> 02:22.274
A drink to celebrate?

02:25.546 --> 02:27.946
Just the check, please.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.485
Of course.

03:02.216 --> 03:07.119
Next time, negotiate the
price before taking the job.

03:19.500 --> 03:20.500
Mr. Keith.

03:22.102 --> 03:23.735
Now that you have the memo,

03:26.106 --> 03:28.540
what do you intend
to do with it?

03:28.542 --> 03:30.776
I see you have deduced
some other things.

03:32.580 --> 03:36.448
But perhaps you should
concern yourself

03:37.751 --> 03:40.619
with deducing the
things you are paid

03:40.621 --> 03:42.721
to deduce.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.089
What do you say?

03:50.598 --> 03:51.598
However,

03:54.068 --> 03:56.868
I won't mention
it to my friends.

04:01.809 --> 04:06.078
I like you, Anton, your father
would have been very proud.

05:38.639 --> 05:40.205
Why Lah so broke, huh?

05:41.775 --> 05:44.109
Don't know, crap pay, maybe.

05:45.546 --> 05:47.346
I'll bank this today,
you'll get your cut

05:47.348 --> 05:51.683
in three this time, this
time, I'm only get 10% out

05:51.685 --> 05:54.720
of 600 fucking ringgit?

05:57.825 --> 06:00.726
Hey, how am I gonna promote you

06:00.728 --> 06:03.895
from trainee to partner if
you cannot nego, huh, bodo?

06:03.897 --> 06:07.032
Hey, I forgot, okay?

06:08.068 --> 06:09.101
Geez.

06:11.739 --> 06:12.938
- Is this it?
- What?

06:14.174 --> 06:15.640
You know, being a PI,

06:15.642 --> 06:16.875
I'd always imagined it to be...

06:16.877 --> 06:20.178
<i>More glamorous, hmm?</i>

06:20.180 --> 06:23.915
Grow up, there's no job in
the world that doesn't suck.

06:31.625 --> 06:32.991
What's that?

06:32.993 --> 06:36.128
Violet Horizons by Joseph Tone.

06:36.130 --> 06:37.496
What else did he write?

06:37.498 --> 06:41.366
Chaos is my Order,
Sultan Street Serenade.

06:41.368 --> 06:43.402
You know, if it
wasn't for this guy,

06:43.404 --> 06:45.003
I'd be flipping burgers by now.

06:45.839 --> 06:47.806
This work, in real life,

06:47.808 --> 06:52.878
the femme fatal is a 250
pound auntie with frizzy hair,

06:53.347 --> 06:54.946
and she wants you
to find her cute

06:54.948 --> 06:56.748
and harmless little poodle.

06:58.018 --> 07:00.819
<i>Cute and harmless.</i>

07:03.123 --> 07:06.525
Hey, tomorrow I'm off,
remember that training job

07:06.527 --> 07:09.561
in Sentul, you
think you're ready

07:09.563 --> 07:14.132
to guard the keys to my little
kingdom, in the meantime?

07:26.346 --> 07:29.281
Hey, my secondary
number, in case,

07:29.283 --> 07:32.250
if you get into any
shit, which you won't,

07:32.252 --> 07:34.820
if you follow my
instructions, right, right?

07:38.225 --> 07:39.225
Seriously, bro.

07:41.428 --> 07:43.895
This job is as boring
as any other job.

07:43.897 --> 07:47.265
Can't be as boring as
house sitting your shit hole.

07:47.267 --> 07:48.967
Hey, shit, man.

07:50.103 --> 07:51.103
Oh.

07:52.172 --> 07:53.172
Look.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.578
The turkey is in the oven.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.983
Mm.

09:11.985 --> 09:14.219
Perks of the job, boy.

09:24.598 --> 09:28.700
From across many
oceans, the seeker came.

09:30.504 --> 09:34.839
As time wore on, the
seeker forgot his quest,

09:34.841 --> 09:37.342
and sought a new riddle,

09:38.679 --> 09:43.682
which led him to the land beyond
the Kingdom of Plain Sight.

09:48.021 --> 09:50.288
In the Kingdom of the Hidden,

09:51.491 --> 09:54.893
he found happiness at
last with the princess.

10:05.238 --> 10:06.838
And the princess bore a child.

10:22.089 --> 10:27.158
But the walls separating the
child's two worlds was thin.

10:30.097 --> 10:33.498
So the Hidden Ones
watched, waiting

10:35.102 --> 10:37.335
for the wall to crumble.

11:42.369 --> 11:43.868
This all you got so far?

11:45.138 --> 11:46.138
For now.

11:47.240 --> 11:51.776
Still, I'm impressed
you located this one.

11:53.180 --> 11:55.180
Midnight Marshal number one,

11:56.616 --> 11:58.917
a true collector's
item, well done.

12:00.320 --> 12:03.254
The trick is to notice
something others often miss.

12:05.258 --> 12:06.958
And have you noticed something?

12:09.396 --> 12:10.662
Have you read this?

12:11.998 --> 12:16.468
The Lathe of Heaven, it's
about an ordinary man

12:16.470 --> 12:19.738
who discovers he has
extraordinary powers

12:19.740 --> 12:22.874
to alter reality
with his dreams.

12:25.011 --> 12:26.144
I prefer a mystery.

12:27.781 --> 12:31.116
Detective novels for
the novel detective.

12:31.118 --> 12:32.984
I quite enjoy science fiction.

12:34.254 --> 12:38.656
But fantasy, now, there's
my favorite genre.

12:39.960 --> 12:43.394
Wizards, dragons, and
magic, stuff like that?

12:43.396 --> 12:45.263
There's so much
more to fantasy than

12:45.265 --> 12:49.801
<i>that fanboy claptrap.</i>

12:56.843 --> 12:58.343
Ah.

12:58.345 --> 13:03.314
Yes, classic game book
of your genre persuasion.

13:04.684 --> 13:09.387
Back in the day, it was
quite popular in a series,

13:10.157 --> 13:11.422
it's forgotten now.

13:12.793 --> 13:17.862
This copy may well be the
last one in existence.

13:21.334 --> 13:22.433
Any other leads?

13:24.337 --> 13:27.939
Well, I'm working on
picking up more clues.

13:31.244 --> 13:34.379
Just make sure you don't
pick up any misleading ones,

13:34.381 --> 13:36.047
not everything is as they seem.

14:18.525 --> 14:21.392
No author, no publishing house?

14:22.395 --> 14:25.263
That's odd.

14:25.265 --> 14:29.434
A child's fearful dream of
falling is praised as a gift

14:29.436 --> 14:31.436
to learn to fly the next night.

15:15.148 --> 15:20.218
A long time ago, I lived,
worked, and married here,

15:20.987 --> 15:22.067
but things didn't work out.

15:24.824 --> 15:27.492
Your husband was
also a foreigner?

15:28.295 --> 15:31.062
No, he was a local.

15:32.899 --> 15:33.965
Like I said,

15:36.169 --> 15:39.003
we divorced, I left,

15:40.073 --> 15:43.107
my company moved
me to Thailand, but

15:44.210 --> 15:45.343
we had a child,

15:46.680 --> 15:47.680
a daughter.

15:48.882 --> 15:51.082
Every month, I'd send
her money, but I,

15:52.018 --> 15:53.084
I never visited

15:55.021 --> 15:58.823
<i>until last year.
To see your daughter?</i>

15:58.825 --> 16:02.927
No, to find her, she
went missing, Mr. Shaw,

16:02.929 --> 16:05.163
for a year, and the police here?

16:06.299 --> 16:09.000
They made no
progress whatsoever.

16:09.002 --> 16:12.236
<i>My boss, Mr. Dan Hamzi,
he's the one you should...</i>

16:12.238 --> 16:13.972
But he's not here, is he?

16:15.308 --> 16:17.942
You are.

16:17.944 --> 16:22.013
I usually find things,
Mrs. Numan, not people.

16:27.087 --> 16:29.921
Do you know any reason why
she'd want to disappear?

16:31.491 --> 16:34.792
No.

16:38.698 --> 16:41.199
In fact, I don't know
anything about my daughter.

16:42.469 --> 16:45.269
You see, Lamya, she
had difficulties

16:45.271 --> 16:48.606
in communicating with
others, until she found a way

16:48.608 --> 16:50.908
to express herself
through her canvas.

16:55.115 --> 16:57.749
I found out about this
exhibit on the internet,

16:58.952 --> 17:01.986
marking the one year anniversary
of her disappearance.

17:03.556 --> 17:05.123
This is where you can begin.

17:05.892 --> 17:07.058
What if she's dead?

17:09.061 --> 17:12.530
Then at least I'll have a
body to bury, and to mourn.

17:15.367 --> 17:20.438
<i>Please, just look at her.</i>

17:21.840 --> 17:23.141
As you can see,

17:24.243 --> 17:25.977
I can pay very handsomely.

17:28.648 --> 17:29.881
Oh, and one more thing.

17:31.351 --> 17:35.953
Please be discreet, I'm on
a visitor's visa, and, well.

17:37.323 --> 17:38.323
You know.

17:39.325 --> 17:44.395
Absolutely.

17:55.408 --> 18:00.278
It seems strange, I don't
know how or why she chose me.

18:01.781 --> 18:05.116
I'm not even a
licensed private eye.

18:09.856 --> 18:10.955
But there felt

18:12.158 --> 18:16.994
<i>a deeper meaning.</i>

18:22.102 --> 18:24.302
Not that it mattered,
for the amount

18:24.304 --> 18:26.938
of coin this lady was
willing to pony up,

18:26.940 --> 18:28.840
I'd find her
daughter, her brother,

18:28.842 --> 18:32.110
her mother, and her ancestors.

19:51.391 --> 19:53.658
Hell of a time
for you to bug me.

19:53.660 --> 19:57.228
It's important, do
you remember Lamya Shahruddin?

19:58.865 --> 20:00.431
Yeah, I remember that case.

20:01.768 --> 20:04.235
What can I say, sometimes
people just disappear.

20:05.505 --> 20:06.505
Like me?

20:08.608 --> 20:10.007
What do you want, Anton?

20:10.009 --> 20:11.309
I need a favor.

20:12.478 --> 20:15.046
You still got friends
in the police?

20:15.048 --> 20:16.547
What do I look like?

20:16.549 --> 20:18.916
I need some
info from Missing Persons.

20:18.918 --> 20:22.086
Oi, you're not gonna do
something stupid, right?

20:22.088 --> 20:25.423
It's for research,
you know me, nosy as hell.

20:44.210 --> 20:46.043
So can you help me?

20:47.947 --> 20:50.681
Why should I, because
of you, I lost my mark.

20:50.683 --> 20:53.818
No, you haven't, I
saw a woman walk out

20:53.820 --> 20:56.921
with a guy to that hotel,
your marks, correct?

20:57.957 --> 20:59.290
I saw him spinning a room key,

20:59.292 --> 21:01.926
and I caught the first
two digits, six and one.

21:01.928 --> 21:04.061
Now, that hotel only
has three digit rooms,

21:04.063 --> 21:06.897
and 610 to 619 run
across the east facade,

21:06.899 --> 21:08.332
with the windows facing out.

21:08.334 --> 21:09.834
You should have a good
vantage point from the roof

21:09.836 --> 21:12.737
of this building, if they
don't shut the curtains.

21:16.109 --> 21:19.076
Did you renegotiate
your pay with Keith?

21:21.047 --> 21:23.547
Dan, help me out here, please.

21:27.220 --> 21:28.220
Fine.

21:29.055 --> 21:31.455
But no funny stuff, hmm?

21:31.457 --> 21:33.691
Don't try to play the
hero, or some shit.

21:38.264 --> 21:41.666
Oi.

21:41.668 --> 21:46.270
<i>Feeling stuffy much?</i>

21:50.977 --> 21:52.677
The suit makes the man, kiddo.

22:03.723 --> 22:06.457
I'll just give that a tug there.

22:07.727 --> 22:10.695
There you go, nothing
fancy, like a Windsor knot.

22:11.798 --> 22:14.665
Never trust a man
with a Windsor knot.

22:14.667 --> 22:15.900
You know who said that?

22:17.437 --> 22:21.238
You don't like super
spies, why not?

22:21.240 --> 22:23.974
Detectives are better, like you.

22:25.111 --> 22:26.610
But we both solve crimes.

22:26.612 --> 22:30.214
Come on, he's a terribly spy.

22:30.216 --> 22:31.615
Why is he a terrible spy?

22:31.617 --> 22:34.518
He tells everyone who he is.

22:34.520 --> 22:37.722
Well, he tells them who
he is, but not what he does.

22:37.724 --> 22:40.091
You wanna know what
real detectives do?

22:41.094 --> 22:42.993
Spy on people,

22:44.097 --> 22:47.231
<i>to get information.
And that's it?</i>

22:47.233 --> 22:49.300
That's the real world, kiddo.

22:50.403 --> 22:55.439
So what do spies
do in the real world?

22:56.142 --> 22:57.375
If we knew that,

22:57.377 --> 22:59.343
they wouldn't be very
good spies, would they?

23:02.014 --> 23:05.249
I'll worry about the real
world once I'm grown up.

23:08.388 --> 23:12.323
Come on, finish your
shake, we'll be late

23:12.325 --> 23:15.793
<i>for the memorial.</i>

23:43.523 --> 23:47.425
<i>Weapon of choice.</i>

23:48.961 --> 23:51.128
Ammo of choice.

23:51.130 --> 23:53.164
Slug, not buckshot.

23:54.834 --> 23:59.270
<i>More stopping power.</i>

24:03.843 --> 24:08.913
<i>Less spread, less mess.</i>

24:20.460 --> 24:23.227
Take a man's head clean off.

24:27.733 --> 24:29.900
Explain again why you're here?

24:32.138 --> 24:35.139
Lamya's mother
asked me to help find her.

24:36.175 --> 24:37.908
I am Lamya's mother.

24:39.312 --> 24:40.778
Since she was 13.

24:43.549 --> 24:45.883
Strange.

24:45.885 --> 24:47.785
That harpy never
gave a shit before.

24:48.654 --> 24:52.256
You're a private investigator?

24:52.258 --> 24:53.724
Yes, I am.

24:56.429 --> 24:59.964
My late husband,
during the Senoi Praaq,

24:59.966 --> 25:02.733
fighting commies
during the emergency.

25:04.036 --> 25:06.904
- Was he...
- Senoi, sure.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.306
Not that it helped.

25:10.843 --> 25:12.910
They're the masters
of lucid dreaming.

25:13.746 --> 25:14.746
Right.

25:16.048 --> 25:21.085
Whatever that means, something
to do with controlling dreams

25:21.754 --> 25:23.687
to overcome nightmares?

25:23.689 --> 25:26.657
A child's
fearful dream of falling

25:26.659 --> 25:30.094
is praised as a gift to
learn to fly the next night.

25:30.096 --> 25:31.495
John Hassell.

25:32.532 --> 25:35.065
Are you of indigenous descent?

25:36.202 --> 25:37.501
Part of me is.

25:37.503 --> 25:38.503
Ah.

25:40.239 --> 25:41.239
Which tribe?

25:43.376 --> 25:46.343
The oldest.

26:05.998 --> 26:08.799
We never connected, me and her.

26:09.936 --> 26:12.136
She always had this
look about her.

26:14.140 --> 26:17.841
You know, especially after
her old man passed on.

26:18.945 --> 26:20.844
We never forced
her to do anything,

26:21.881 --> 26:25.649
figured if she was doing
something she loved,

26:25.651 --> 26:26.884
she would open up,

26:27.853 --> 26:29.420
but no.

26:29.422 --> 26:33.724
She just disappeared into
her own private world.

26:35.494 --> 26:36.894
Even more.

26:36.896 --> 26:39.530
Did she have any
friends at the university,

26:39.532 --> 26:40.764
men and the likes?

26:42.668 --> 26:45.736
Secretive was Lamya's
middle name, Detective.

26:47.707 --> 26:48.707
So.

26:50.042 --> 26:52.376
We don't know what
she got up to outside,

26:52.378 --> 26:56.814
<i>girls will be girls.</i>

27:10.730 --> 27:15.332
Maybe this will help, this
is her poetry and prose book.

27:16.969 --> 27:18.535
It was her way out.

27:20.339 --> 27:22.506
Maybe it will show you
which way she went.

27:25.411 --> 27:28.178
On the streets of Primrose Hill,

27:28.180 --> 27:30.347
autumn was almost
at end to make way

27:30.349 --> 27:32.650
for the harsh
realities of winter.

27:34.286 --> 27:37.855
Here, in my room, at my dorms,

27:37.857 --> 27:41.458
I can only imagine how beautiful
those brown dying leaves

27:41.460 --> 27:44.128
must look as they
float to the ground.

27:45.665 --> 27:48.465
Outside my window, the
clouds mark the coming

27:48.467 --> 27:52.403
of the monsoon, of darker times.

27:52.405 --> 27:55.773
Could this be an omen, it's
only my first year here

27:55.775 --> 27:58.942
in college, but it's
nothing like how I imagined.

27:58.944 --> 28:01.178
There's no sense
of community here,

28:01.180 --> 28:05.049
and I doubt there ever
will, not at home,

28:05.051 --> 28:06.650
not here, not anywhere.

28:09.055 --> 28:11.121
I only have one refuge,

28:12.124 --> 28:15.993
my dreams.

28:32.445 --> 28:36.046
<i>Look at me.</i>

28:40.252 --> 28:41.652
What do you see?

28:44.090 --> 28:46.056
I see my dream.

28:59.205 --> 29:00.938
Am I real?

29:03.542 --> 29:05.075
Yes.

29:19.358 --> 29:21.125
Then I'm no dream.

29:24.663 --> 29:26.396
It sure feels like one.

29:28.467 --> 29:30.968
Yet you believe it's real.

29:33.639 --> 29:35.939
I believe what I see.

29:40.412 --> 29:43.113
How can you believe in someone

29:43.115 --> 29:45.115
that you don't know?

30:01.433 --> 30:03.100
I've always known you.

30:04.403 --> 30:06.470
And I, you.

30:12.144 --> 30:14.711
I know everything I
need to know about her,

30:14.713 --> 30:16.780
but I still had no
idea where she was.

30:17.750 --> 30:20.284
I only had one feasible lead.

31:16.842 --> 31:19.276
She's been missing for
more than a year now.

31:19.278 --> 31:21.078
So are 1,000 other people,

31:22.214 --> 31:23.914
you're looking
for them, as well?

31:25.351 --> 31:29.019
Her parents hired
me to find her.

31:29.021 --> 31:33.423
And what have you found
out, Mr. Detective man?

31:34.860 --> 31:38.495
You, her best
friend, her only friend.

31:40.332 --> 31:43.800
We were classmates, I
don't think we were pals.

31:48.741 --> 31:49.741
Did she date?

31:50.442 --> 31:51.442
No.

31:52.244 --> 31:53.977
She was a good girl.

31:56.115 --> 31:59.383
But that didn't stop guys
from lusting after her.

32:04.790 --> 32:05.822
Like who?

32:06.625 --> 32:08.058
My dance professor.

32:09.662 --> 32:12.329
- He tried it on?
- Definitely did.

32:13.699 --> 32:17.734
He even set up a special
tutorial for her, anyway,

32:17.736 --> 32:22.005
she ditched his class as
soon as he revealed his hand.

32:27.513 --> 32:31.748
About a week after, before
she vanished, actually.

32:35.054 --> 32:37.788
- And do you think he...
- Maybe.

32:38.924 --> 32:41.224
But 60 alibis said
that the turd was

32:41.226 --> 32:44.895
in tutorial the whole day,
police questioned him,

32:46.065 --> 32:49.967
<i>cleared him.</i>

32:49.969 --> 32:51.568
Cops ask the wrong questions.

33:26.271 --> 33:29.539
You know, you look
kind of familiar.

33:33.579 --> 33:34.579
Have we met?

33:43.088 --> 33:44.154
If we did,

33:46.425 --> 33:47.591
it'll come back to me.

33:57.469 --> 33:58.802
No.

33:58.804 --> 33:59.870
It's about Lamya.

34:09.481 --> 34:12.616
Make it quick, I have a
staff meeting to attend.

34:14.119 --> 34:15.119
At this hour?

34:16.922 --> 34:19.356
It is night school, you fool.

34:21.226 --> 34:24.161
I understand Lamya spoke
to you in many occasions,

34:25.397 --> 34:26.996
do you think she ran away?

34:28.100 --> 34:29.132
And if so,

34:30.936 --> 34:32.803
what was she running from?

34:34.172 --> 34:36.273
What else?

34:36.275 --> 34:38.507
Reality.

34:38.510 --> 34:42.512
My dear man, I'm surprised
she didn't do it sooner.

34:43.649 --> 34:46.817
The poor child, and
if she found someone

34:46.819 --> 34:49.418
to share her delusion,

34:49.420 --> 34:52.989
then I wouldn't be surprised
if she ran off with him.

34:52.991 --> 34:55.092
Unfortunately, it wasn't you.

34:55.094 --> 34:56.094
What?

34:57.696 --> 34:59.062
Or did you only want to?

35:00.833 --> 35:04.067
Did she turn you down,
laugh in your face?

35:07.606 --> 35:09.339
<i>What are you insinuating?</i>

35:10.709 --> 35:11.942
Not me.

35:12.945 --> 35:15.946
This.

35:20.119 --> 35:23.553
My source informs me that she
regularly handed you this book

35:23.555 --> 35:25.222
to evaluate her writing talents.

35:27.593 --> 35:30.627
Professor,

35:30.629 --> 35:32.395
<i>Professor, Professor?</i>

35:40.873 --> 35:42.105
Enough.

35:53.986 --> 35:56.820
She wanted out, didn't
she, she wanted out

35:56.822 --> 35:59.256
from whatever shit
stick you got her into,

35:59.258 --> 36:01.791
but you couldn't let that
happen, so you killed her.

36:01.793 --> 36:04.060
It wasn't me, it was them.

36:05.531 --> 36:07.497
Oh, fuck.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.705
You don't understand.

36:15.707 --> 36:20.777
Nobody understands your
stupid mind, stupid, stupid.

36:21.313 --> 36:22.779
Calm down.

36:22.781 --> 36:25.282
I thought I could join
them, compose my own world,

36:25.284 --> 36:29.452
open the gateway with my own
craft, but I wasn't worthy.

36:30.322 --> 36:32.656
I wasn't worthy.

36:36.862 --> 36:39.863
You don't get it, do
you, they denied me, me!

36:42.000 --> 36:43.600
What did they deny you?

36:46.405 --> 36:49.773
Is it you, you pissant?

36:50.909 --> 36:54.010
What makes you more
worthy than me?

36:55.714 --> 36:56.947
A learned man!

36:58.317 --> 37:02.185
A learned man, who's wasted
in this fucking shit hole,

37:02.187 --> 37:05.922
and they wouldn't let
me finish their story?

37:05.924 --> 37:09.626
I ask you again, is it you?

37:16.702 --> 37:21.071
Cloud walker, she
was a cloud walker.

37:21.073 --> 37:24.374
The door to a kingdom, the door.

37:24.376 --> 37:28.011
It was there, it was
there in her journal,

37:30.249 --> 37:32.882
- I tried to crack...
- Crack what?

37:32.884 --> 37:36.519
<i>The combination,
combination to her kingdom.</i>

37:36.521 --> 37:39.089
Kingdom, the fuck
are you talking about?

37:39.091 --> 37:41.291
Unlock the sequence,
and the doors open,

37:41.293 --> 37:44.261
the doorway to her dreams, dream

37:45.397 --> 37:48.865
teller, storyteller,
but they stopped me.

37:48.867 --> 37:49.867
Who?

37:51.169 --> 37:54.838
The Hidden Ones, they guard
the doors against trespassers.

38:01.813 --> 38:03.213
Trespassers like you.

38:05.417 --> 38:06.417
Fucker.

38:34.780 --> 38:38.915
Could I really die,
could I re-dream it?

38:41.720 --> 38:44.554
How was I rewriting
the game book?

38:54.266 --> 38:57.033
If you think the art teacher
is a person of interest,

38:57.035 --> 39:00.904
<i>go to page 26.</i>

39:00.906 --> 39:02.439
I had to find Lamya.

40:03.702 --> 40:06.770
<i>You know,
you seem awfully familiar.</i>

40:08.540 --> 40:09.540
How so?

40:11.143 --> 40:12.942
<i>I can't quite place it,</i>

40:13.745 --> 40:17.147
I can just smell it, you know?

40:20.852 --> 40:23.887
Sweet scent of virginity.

40:46.511 --> 40:47.544
I'm sorry?

40:48.980 --> 40:52.015
That's just it, the both
of you are exactly alike,

40:52.017 --> 40:55.819
like two aliens who've landed
here from some foreign planet,

40:55.821 --> 40:58.955
and you're just trying to
find your space in this world,

40:58.957 --> 41:03.426
which is so, well, alien to you.

41:03.428 --> 41:06.396
Kind of like Superman,
but without the babies.

41:07.499 --> 41:10.166
Do you believe
in fate, Ms. Kahn?

41:10.168 --> 41:16.506
No, I believe in wants,
desires, fantasies.

41:18.043 --> 41:19.943
Much like what Lamya did,

41:19.945 --> 41:23.680
and we all have the need
to express ourselves.

41:24.516 --> 41:26.583
What do you desire most, Anton?

41:40.465 --> 41:41.631
Ms. Kahn, please.

41:45.770 --> 41:46.770
Fine.

41:53.278 --> 41:54.477
Did she date?

41:57.415 --> 41:59.916
We were roomies, not buddies,

41:59.918 --> 42:02.485
but there was definitely
someone interested in her.

42:04.523 --> 42:08.925
Our art professor, he paid
particular attention to her.

42:10.061 --> 42:14.197
Yeah, he was the kind
of guy who would say,

42:14.199 --> 42:17.834
the younger the fiddle,
the tighter its strings,

42:17.836 --> 42:20.370
<i>if you know what I mean.
He made a move?</i>

42:21.206 --> 42:22.438
Yes, all the way

42:22.440 --> 42:24.807
to setting up a special
tutorial just for her.

42:26.177 --> 42:29.913
Believe me, she ran like the
wind the moment she found out.

42:29.915 --> 42:32.348
That was the week before
she disappeared, actually.

43:10.088 --> 43:11.588
I'm sorry, that number is busy.

43:11.590 --> 43:14.557
Please leave a message
after the tone.

43:14.559 --> 43:17.026
Dan, help me.

45:21.019 --> 45:24.787
The game book had changed
everything somehow.

45:24.789 --> 45:28.658
As the story changed in my
mind, it changed in reality.

45:40.605 --> 45:42.972
If this even is reality.

47:43.394 --> 47:46.028
Hey, are you nuts,
meeting me here?

47:46.030 --> 47:47.330
I could blow my operation.

47:47.332 --> 47:48.332
You got it?

47:51.135 --> 47:53.102
Do you know what
that fucking cost me?

47:54.172 --> 47:55.204
Oh, shit, no.

47:56.174 --> 47:57.006
What?

47:57.008 --> 47:58.875
No, no!

47:58.877 --> 48:00.610
This is not her.

48:00.612 --> 48:02.879
It's the only Lamya
Shahruddin case there is.

48:02.881 --> 48:05.147
I'm not losing my
mind, this is not her.

48:07.585 --> 48:09.285
What's going on?

48:09.287 --> 48:10.287
The body,

48:11.055 --> 48:12.889
the body was just there.

48:12.891 --> 48:15.391
And I had this tarot
card in my hand, it's

48:17.462 --> 48:20.429
<i>with me somewhere.</i>

48:20.431 --> 48:21.431
Okay.

48:22.400 --> 48:25.635
The book, the book,
it's in the office.

48:25.637 --> 48:27.803
I'll show you what happened.

48:27.805 --> 48:30.539
They're gonna kill me,
they're gonna fucking kill me.

48:30.541 --> 48:32.675
I know it's a setup,
but I have no choice.

48:32.677 --> 48:33.677
They have her.

48:36.047 --> 48:37.047
They have her.

48:38.483 --> 48:39.415
Who's they?

48:39.417 --> 48:40.883
The bastards that took me, I,

48:42.253 --> 48:44.453
I know it's them, I see their
fucking faces every night

48:44.455 --> 48:46.355
- in my dreams.
- Oh, okay, okay.

48:46.357 --> 48:48.958
Calm down, let's
start from the top.

48:48.960 --> 48:50.126
How did this happen?

48:50.128 --> 48:51.193
This, this woman.

48:52.563 --> 48:54.330
She asked me to
find her daughter.

48:56.067 --> 48:57.433
What do you mean, asked?

48:58.770 --> 49:01.671
You're not even licensed,
you were just supposed

49:01.673 --> 49:04.373
to hold the fort, not
fucking do my job.

49:06.144 --> 49:07.144
Anton,

49:08.212 --> 49:09.745
are you taking your medicine?

49:15.920 --> 49:16.886
Anton, go home.

49:16.888 --> 49:18.187
You don't believe me, do you?

49:18.189 --> 49:19.455
Come on, let's go.

49:19.457 --> 49:21.924
You think this is
a fucking delusion?

49:21.926 --> 49:24.527
I know you're
fucking delusional!

49:24.529 --> 49:28.331
<i>Now, go the fuck home.</i>

49:31.402 --> 49:32.935
Fuck it.

49:43.414 --> 49:44.414
Anton.

49:46.084 --> 49:47.383
I can't blow this case.

49:50.288 --> 49:51.420
You're off your meds.

49:52.991 --> 49:55.825
Tomorrow, tomorrow we'll
go see the doctor, and

49:56.928 --> 50:00.029
<i>take some, okay?</i>

50:00.031 --> 50:02.465
Okay, we'll, we'll deal
with this tomorrow.

50:13.311 --> 50:15.678
Mr. <i>Keith, did you send someone</i>

50:15.680 --> 50:17.747
to my office a few days ago?

50:17.749 --> 50:19.548
Who is this?

50:19.550 --> 50:22.084
The guy you ripped
off because you could.

50:23.154 --> 50:25.855
<i>Anton, how could I ever forget?</i>

50:25.857 --> 50:27.656
Do you know a Louise Numan?

50:29.027 --> 50:31.894
<i>Can't say that
I do, what is this about?</i>

50:53.351 --> 50:54.850
You're not her.

50:56.254 --> 50:57.653
Is Ms. Shahruddin here?

50:58.823 --> 51:01.690
Shahruddin, they
moved, last year.

51:03.361 --> 51:04.927
What?

51:04.929 --> 51:09.065
Look, you go outside,
I give you the address.

51:10.535 --> 51:11.535
Oi!

51:30.354 --> 51:34.657
<i>I'm a detective.</i>

51:34.659 --> 51:37.426
You've got to have
experience, a track record,

51:38.296 --> 51:41.197
what do you have, huh?

51:41.199 --> 51:43.666
Imagination?

51:46.304 --> 51:47.703
Why did you become a cop?

51:52.443 --> 51:54.510
Because of you, my bro.

51:54.512 --> 51:59.381
Remember the first day that
we ran into each other?

51:59.383 --> 52:00.749
It felt good to be a hero.

52:02.920 --> 52:05.154
I wanted to help
other kids, too,

52:05.156 --> 52:08.324
and when I met your
dad, it sealed the deal.

52:10.294 --> 52:13.896
How did you and Anton
meet again after 30 years?

52:16.667 --> 52:21.337
He found me, and the
kid has his dad's talents,

52:21.339 --> 52:23.105
even as his mind
is falling apart.

52:24.542 --> 52:27.243
All his life, he couldn't
remember what happened back then.

52:29.614 --> 52:32.014
Pieces came back to
him in his dreams.

52:34.252 --> 52:36.218
He came back here
looking for answers.

52:38.756 --> 52:42.191
Since his dad died, I
was the only anchor left

52:42.193 --> 52:43.893
for him to the event.

52:45.229 --> 52:46.662
Then why did you quit?

52:48.799 --> 52:51.600
Reality.

52:51.602 --> 52:54.403
It's complicated, listen,
politics, oh, you know what?

52:56.174 --> 52:57.606
I wanted to do my own thing.

53:00.711 --> 53:04.079
Same here.

53:08.553 --> 53:11.320
He was sinking deeper
into his childhood persona.

53:16.527 --> 53:18.360
Okay, fine.

53:18.362 --> 53:20.329
I'm gonna take you
on as my assistant.

53:21.933 --> 53:23.866
No, no, no, no, no,
stop, stop, stop,

53:23.868 --> 53:26.001
not an assistant, intern.

53:27.972 --> 53:30.272
You help me out,
follow my orders.

53:31.576 --> 53:35.277
<i>If you don't fuck up.</i>

53:35.279 --> 53:37.479
Are you fucking serious?

53:37.481 --> 53:40.849
Don't get too excited,
this is just a dry run.

53:40.851 --> 53:42.318
If you fuck up, ch.

53:44.222 --> 53:45.621
Understand?

53:47.558 --> 53:50.893
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
relax, relax, relax.

53:50.895 --> 53:55.965
The job gave him focus, maybe
doing basic investigative work

53:57.101 --> 53:58.541
could lead him back
to his real self.

54:00.238 --> 54:01.238
He was working.

54:03.808 --> 54:04.808
I thought he was.

55:06.404 --> 55:08.404
Dan, help me.

55:29.493 --> 55:31.026
My mind was unraveling.

55:32.396 --> 55:34.596
It felt like if I
could just find Lamya,

55:35.933 --> 55:39.535
I might also find myself,
understand what happened to me

55:39.537 --> 55:44.606
when I was a kid, unlock my
memories, but I had nothing.

55:52.016 --> 55:56.985
<i>Maybe one thing.</i>

56:19.477 --> 56:21.043
Why is this happening to me?

56:23.080 --> 56:24.613
Isn't this what you wanted?

56:26.350 --> 56:28.684
Mystery, murder,

56:29.620 --> 56:33.589
lust?

56:33.591 --> 56:35.924
Everything you ever imagined,

56:37.194 --> 56:41.096
everything you ever
needed to love.

56:42.533 --> 56:45.534
You thought it wasn't
going to be a bumpy ride.

56:45.536 --> 56:48.537
Every protagonist needs
to be antagonized.

56:49.473 --> 56:51.573
You're writing the story, Anton,

56:52.843 --> 56:56.111
we just pick up the pieces,
put them into place.

56:58.215 --> 56:59.748
But if you're strong enough

57:01.051 --> 57:03.185
to see it through the
way you want it to,

57:05.022 --> 57:06.054
you'll make it.

57:30.948 --> 57:31.948
No!

57:32.650 --> 57:34.082
Run!

57:34.084 --> 57:35.551
Run!

57:35.553 --> 57:36.553
Run, run!

57:37.555 --> 57:42.624
No, no!

01:00:18.749 --> 01:00:21.717
<i>You, my pet.</i>

01:00:21.719 --> 01:00:23.285
What do you want?

01:00:23.287 --> 01:00:28.357
<i>To stop you!</i>

01:00:29.426 --> 01:00:31.526
No kid should wield
that much power.

01:00:38.235 --> 01:00:41.436
But we'll fix you,
we'll fix you fine.

01:00:43.474 --> 01:00:45.340
Where is Lamya?

01:00:50.047 --> 01:00:53.015
Yes, of course,
hook, line, and sinker,

01:00:53.017 --> 01:00:57.219
he took the bait, jail bait.

01:00:58.322 --> 01:01:01.490
You boys are so fucking
predictable.

01:01:04.762 --> 01:01:08.030
But why?

01:01:08.032 --> 01:01:09.731
Why do you need her so much,

01:01:12.503 --> 01:01:13.769
when we have each other?

01:01:21.712 --> 01:01:22.712
So.

01:01:24.615 --> 01:01:25.681
Do you want to play?

01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:29.851
Or run away into your book,

01:01:33.524 --> 01:01:36.658
little boy?

01:01:39.296 --> 01:01:40.562
So you want to play?

01:01:42.733 --> 01:01:45.834
Or run away to your
book, little boy?

01:02:01.752 --> 01:02:03.652
Kid never want to
stop playing, huh?

01:02:20.237 --> 01:02:23.572
I should have killed you
when I had the chance.

01:02:30.881 --> 01:02:33.248
I should have ripped you
into a million pieces

01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:35.217
when I had the chance.

01:03:23.133 --> 01:03:25.600
Play time's over, boy.

01:03:53.564 --> 01:03:54.564
It took a while.

01:03:57.267 --> 01:03:58.300
But who's counting,

01:04:00.671 --> 01:04:03.205
when the one who
got away is back

01:04:04.641 --> 01:04:06.208
in my loving arms.

01:04:07.211 --> 01:04:08.211
You see,

01:04:10.447 --> 01:04:12.180
boys will be boys.

01:05:16.546 --> 01:05:19.981
Ah, do you know how
much damage you've done?

01:05:21.518 --> 01:05:23.118
How much I've got to set right?

01:05:26.556 --> 01:05:31.626
But we set her right, didn't we?

01:05:50.981 --> 01:05:54.382
Stay away from
him, take me instead.

01:05:57.788 --> 01:06:02.857
<i>You're not my type.</i>

01:06:14.271 --> 01:06:18.473
<i>She's mine, then.</i>

01:06:25.215 --> 01:06:27.916
That bitch took it for you, you!

01:06:29.853 --> 01:06:31.086
So you could run!

01:06:32.723 --> 01:06:34.589
It's all your fault
she's like this.

01:06:38.228 --> 01:06:41.429
<i>But it's good.</i>

01:06:41.431 --> 01:06:43.331
It's good we found each other.

01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:50.905
Now, I've got
another use for you.

01:06:54.144 --> 01:06:59.214
<i>Another use for you.</i>

01:07:02.853 --> 01:07:06.521
You'll be needing this
for what comes next.

01:07:11.928 --> 01:07:14.929
See, pretty little girls
aren't the only bait.

01:07:15.999 --> 01:07:20.135
An old acquaintance owes
me a pound of flesh,

01:07:20.137 --> 01:07:22.337
and I always collect my due.

01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:24.873
Khalid!

01:07:24.875 --> 01:07:29.778
<i>Your turn to do the honors.</i>

01:09:04.341 --> 01:09:06.573
You're supposed to be dead.

01:09:08.511 --> 01:09:10.211
Only in one version, kiddo.

01:09:12.883 --> 01:09:15.517
You see what kind of a
shit storm you get into

01:09:15.519 --> 01:09:17.452
when you don't stick
to your old man?

01:09:19.756 --> 01:09:21.890
You're the one who
didn't stick around.

01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:29.029
But I paid a price for my
sins, you were that price.

01:09:31.301 --> 01:09:34.202
Tonight, we fix everything.

01:09:39.743 --> 01:09:41.009
She paid a price, too.

01:09:43.947 --> 01:09:44.947
For me.

01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:33.895
Alone again,
without even a person

01:10:33.897 --> 01:10:35.530
to share this silence with.

01:10:38.001 --> 01:10:40.568
I would have thought that
would have been the way

01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:42.604
for the rest of my
time in this world,

01:10:44.241 --> 01:10:46.908
another existence floating

01:10:48.645 --> 01:10:49.645
amongst the living,

01:10:52.215 --> 01:10:54.282
until fate brought
me to my destiny.

01:11:29.252 --> 01:11:31.619
The more I saw him,

01:11:31.621 --> 01:11:34.722
the more I realized
how similar we were,

01:11:36.559 --> 01:11:40.928
two people awake in a
world full of dreamers.

01:11:49.172 --> 01:11:50.571
It's not use.

01:11:55.645 --> 01:11:56.911
He's already marked you.

01:11:58.381 --> 01:11:59.381
Who is he?

01:12:01.951 --> 01:12:04.118
A devourer of dreams.

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:05.586
And who are you?

01:12:06.423 --> 01:12:07.822
The one who makes them.

01:12:11.294 --> 01:12:12.560
Then who am I?

01:12:12.562 --> 01:12:14.028
Isn't it obvious?

01:12:17.834 --> 01:12:21.169
You, you've come to take...

01:12:21.171 --> 01:12:26.240
<i>Take you away from here.</i>

01:12:27.344 --> 01:12:32.146
<i>Shh, it's all right.</i>

01:12:34.617 --> 01:12:39.620
Shh.

01:12:39.622 --> 01:12:42.290
It's all right, it's all right.

01:12:46.496 --> 01:12:47.496
But,

01:12:48.898 --> 01:12:49.898
what about?

01:12:50.867 --> 01:12:53.368
It's not a dream without him.

01:12:53.370 --> 01:12:56.804
If you go now,
they will stop you.

01:12:58.942 --> 01:13:00.441
When will I see him again?

01:13:02.479 --> 01:13:04.645
He'll join you eventually.

01:13:05.982 --> 01:13:07.415
You'll come for him, too?

01:13:09.986 --> 01:13:13.354
<i>When he's ready.</i>

01:13:19.829 --> 01:13:21.596
There's something
I have to do first.

01:13:54.230 --> 01:13:55.696
These pages are for you.

01:13:57.233 --> 01:13:58.233
One day,

01:14:00.103 --> 01:14:01.436
I hope you'll find them,

01:14:03.339 --> 01:14:04.339
and join me

01:14:07.143 --> 01:14:09.944
on a threshold to
a new beginning.

01:14:12.582 --> 01:14:16.184
<i>I will wait for you.</i>

01:14:40.410 --> 01:14:41.410
This is it,

01:14:42.345 --> 01:14:43.345
isn't it?

01:14:44.848 --> 01:14:45.848
What?

01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:47.950
You,

01:14:50.653 --> 01:14:54.121
we have to slay the beast

01:14:54.123 --> 01:14:58.025
forever.

01:14:58.027 --> 01:14:59.827
But we won, right?

01:15:27.423 --> 01:15:31.125
Bastard!

01:16:00.089 --> 01:16:02.323
A lot can happen
in one page, girl.

01:16:34.290 --> 01:16:36.123
Bleed for me, my pet.

01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:41.028
<i>Bleed for me.</i>

01:17:22.205 --> 01:17:23.804
Slay the beast.

01:17:27.577 --> 01:17:29.210
How long has he been missing?

01:17:31.547 --> 01:17:32.613
Almost a week.

01:17:37.086 --> 01:17:40.454
Don't blame yourself,
the man wasn't stable.

01:17:41.791 --> 01:17:44.025
You think I don't know that?

01:17:44.027 --> 01:17:46.794
But I took him
on, I had no right

01:17:46.796 --> 01:17:48.629
to send him away
when he needed me.

01:17:50.633 --> 01:17:53.868
Too busy chasing
influential socialites.

01:18:00.643 --> 01:18:03.144
You need help finding him?

01:18:06.949 --> 01:18:08.549
You offering?

01:18:08.551 --> 01:18:09.551
Cash.

01:18:10.753 --> 01:18:12.153
And perhaps a little intel.

01:18:14.991 --> 01:18:17.391
Do you believe in
fate, Mr. Hamzi,

01:18:19.062 --> 01:18:21.362
and life coming full circle?

01:18:23.166 --> 01:18:26.133
<i>Bring him home.</i>

01:18:26.135 --> 01:18:28.402
Violet Horizons, by Joseph Tone.

01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:32.373
You know, if it
wasn't for this guy,

01:18:32.375 --> 01:18:34.608
I'd be flipping burgers by now.

01:19:21.224 --> 01:19:22.224
This is not her!

01:19:23.559 --> 01:19:25.059
It's the only Lamya
Shahruddin case there is.

01:19:25.061 --> 01:19:27.995
I'm not losing
my mind, this is not her.

01:19:46.182 --> 01:19:49.283
Our eyes locked as
we prepared to die.

01:19:50.686 --> 01:19:55.122
There was no turning back,
no escape, only surrender.

01:19:55.124 --> 01:19:58.459
I could feel my lifeblood
warming the cold, hard concrete.

01:20:01.197 --> 01:20:05.032
We may have been worlds
apart, but as we lay there

01:20:05.034 --> 01:20:09.203
in the same place where it all
began, all those years ago,

01:20:09.205 --> 01:20:11.705
we were meant to walk
the clouds together.

01:20:13.342 --> 01:20:17.378
Barely conscious, I rested
in her arms as she struggled

01:20:17.380 --> 01:20:19.180
to speak her last words.

01:20:56.719 --> 01:20:57.952
Slay the beast.

01:22:17.533 --> 01:22:18.533
It's okay.

01:22:19.869 --> 01:22:24.204
<i>It doesn't hurt.</i>

01:22:24.206 --> 01:22:25.572
Not anymore.

01:23:22.198 --> 01:23:23.430
Anton.

01:24:29.865 --> 01:24:32.099
What do you see?

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:52.000
