00:02.836 --> 00:06.047
(musical theme)

00:11.970 --> 00:13.888
- Oh. Ooh!

00:13.930 --> 00:16.057
Don't forget salt and pepper.
- Ooh, yes.

00:16.099 --> 00:18.685
- Mm! I love the smell of bacon
in the morning!

00:18.727 --> 00:20.145
- No, you don't.

00:20.186 --> 00:21.730
You never have bacon
on a ride day.

00:21.771 --> 00:25.191
- It's breakfast for my rodeo
champion, so...

00:25.233 --> 00:27.527
- Oh, thank you, Mama.
- Love you so much.

00:27.569 --> 00:29.863
- These eggs were champions
about 10 minutes ago.

00:29.904 --> 00:31.740
Now, they're scoring
in the low 60s.

00:31.781 --> 00:34.409
- I'm sorry, darling. I was
getting my gameday zone on.

00:34.451 --> 00:36.161
- Whoo!
- He's got a whole process.

00:36.202 --> 00:38.663
- She knows.
- Does that process include

00:38.705 --> 00:41.082
saying "thank you" to your
bullfighting little brother?

00:41.124 --> 00:43.209
- Thank you, brother.
- Hey, V, your coffee's

00:43.251 --> 00:44.836
in your good luck mug
on the counter.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.296
- Oh, thank you.
(cellphone chiming)

00:47.172 --> 00:49.090
- Is everything okay?

00:50.091 --> 00:52.344
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.
Don't worry.

00:52.385 --> 00:54.679
- Here you go.
- Missy, how are you feeling

00:54.721 --> 00:56.139
about your suicide drag today?

00:56.181 --> 00:57.724
- Ooh, I feel good, I'm ready!

00:57.766 --> 01:00.643
- Yeah? Just remember,
keep your leg long, straight

01:00.685 --> 01:02.228
and point your toe.

01:02.270 --> 01:04.564
- Yep, and drag my head
in the corner.

01:04.606 --> 01:06.024
- Hey, can I get a tip?

01:06.066 --> 01:09.027
- You want a tip?
You listen carefully, all right?

01:09.069 --> 01:11.404
Now there are three barrels...

01:11.446 --> 01:13.448
'Scuse me.
That's three barrels.

01:13.490 --> 01:15.325
- Okay, three barrels.
- And here's the important part.

01:16.826 --> 01:18.411
Don't knock them over.

01:18.453 --> 01:21.081
- Oh, so I'm not supposed
to knock the barrels over?

01:21.122 --> 01:22.665
- There you go.
- Everyone is going

01:22.707 --> 01:24.250
to do amazing today.

01:24.292 --> 01:26.044
- Yeah, if we get there on time.

01:26.086 --> 01:29.047
- Mm, Missy's right.
We gotta go.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.174
- Yeah, we do not want to pull
a Cash now, do we?

01:31.216 --> 01:33.426
- Austin.
- Hey, how come whenever

01:33.468 --> 01:35.595
we talk about your brother,

01:35.637 --> 01:37.806
it's in relation with something
you shouldn't do?

01:37.847 --> 01:39.724
- I'm sorry,
have you met the guy?

01:39.766 --> 01:41.267
- Hey, let's not pick on Cash

01:41.309 --> 01:42.936
when he's not here
to defend himself.

01:42.977 --> 01:44.562
- But it's so easy.
(chuckling)

01:44.604 --> 01:46.398
- Hey, you okay?
You haven't touched your food.

01:46.439 --> 01:49.859
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.
Okay? Don't worry.

01:51.986 --> 01:55.532
Now, who is ready to go win
a rodeo?

01:55.573 --> 01:57.075
(cheering)

01:57.117 --> 01:58.201
There we go.
- Yeehaw!

01:58.243 --> 01:59.953
(upbeat country pop music)

01:59.994 --> 02:01.705
(applause and cheering)

02:01.746 --> 02:05.458
- Ladies and gentlemen,
give it up for Missy McMurray,

02:05.500 --> 02:08.169
former Miss Rodeo
Rocky Mountain!

02:08.211 --> 02:10.296
(people cheering)

02:23.143 --> 02:26.104
Missy, we sure do love
to watch you ride,

02:26.146 --> 02:28.648
but we sure do miss you
in competition.

02:28.690 --> 02:30.775
(applause)

02:33.278 --> 02:35.697
(indistinct chatter)

02:44.789 --> 02:46.875
(distant applause)

02:48.084 --> 02:49.669
- Cash!

02:49.711 --> 02:52.505
You're back!
- I am.

02:52.547 --> 02:54.841
- I never thought that
I'd see you again.

02:55.467 --> 02:56.926
(clearing throat)
Are you...

02:56.968 --> 02:58.845
Are you okay?
Are you in one piece?

02:58.887 --> 03:01.723
What is it, leave?
- Done with Corps. I'm home.

03:01.765 --> 03:04.809
(sighing)
How's... How's everything here?

03:05.518 --> 03:07.771
- Okay. Why?

03:08.563 --> 03:11.566
Did you hear that it wasn't?
- How's Austin?

03:13.109 --> 03:14.444
- Fine.

03:15.695 --> 03:18.114
- So... not fine.

03:18.156 --> 03:19.282
- Just...

03:19.324 --> 03:20.909
(distant applause)

03:20.950 --> 03:22.744
You know your brother.

03:24.579 --> 03:26.581
- Missy, I'm so sorry I left
like I did.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.917
- I can't do this right now.

03:28.958 --> 03:30.543
I have to go watch him ride.

03:30.585 --> 03:32.253
- Uh, Missy--
- No, I can't.

03:32.295 --> 03:34.631
- If something is up
with Austin, you gotta tell me.

03:37.092 --> 03:38.551
- Hey, little brother.

03:38.593 --> 03:40.845
First time I see you in years,
and here you are,

03:40.887 --> 03:43.306
trash-talking me to my wife?
- Austin, it's not like that.

03:43.348 --> 03:46.518
- No? What's it like, then?

03:48.770 --> 03:50.897
(distant cheering)

03:50.939 --> 03:52.399
Yeah, that's what I thought.

03:54.109 --> 03:55.610
Good day to be back, though.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.280
(sighing)
- Austin, wait.

04:04.953 --> 04:07.747
(sighing)
- Yeah, I have...

04:07.789 --> 04:10.959
just the craziest feeling.
It just never goes away.

04:11.001 --> 04:13.586
(sighing)
Oh, look.

04:13.628 --> 04:16.297
There's JB, the man himself.

04:17.007 --> 04:19.467
- Isabel. Austin will be great.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.052
- Mm-hmm.
- He always is.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.471
JB knew what he was doing when
he re-upped his sponsorship.

04:25.974 --> 04:28.476
(chuckling)
(sighing nervously)

04:28.518 --> 04:31.062
(indistinct chatter)
- Hey!

04:31.104 --> 04:32.355
- Never mind them
dirty bull riders,

04:32.397 --> 04:33.732
here's the real star
of the show!

04:33.773 --> 04:35.900
- Uh, did you see him?
How does he look?

04:35.942 --> 04:37.944
- Austin?
- You okay?

04:37.986 --> 04:39.487
- Uh, yeah. Um...

04:39.529 --> 04:41.781
He's uh, he's in the zone.
(chuckling)

04:41.823 --> 04:44.367
- Okay, okay. Great.
(cellphone chiming)

04:45.994 --> 04:48.288
- Uh, I just gotta go take care
of something.

04:48.329 --> 04:50.290
I'll be right back.
- Wait, what?

04:50.331 --> 04:52.417
You're gonna miss his ride. V!

04:58.798 --> 05:00.508
(gasping)
- Cash!

05:00.550 --> 05:02.052
- Hi, Momma.
(laughing)

05:02.093 --> 05:05.221
- Ah, come here!
(exclaiming)

05:05.263 --> 05:07.474
- Hey.
- Ah! I can't believe

05:07.515 --> 05:09.601
you're here!
- I missed you.

05:09.642 --> 05:11.144
- Ah, Cash!
- Hey, folks!

05:11.186 --> 05:13.146
Hank Hickson here from Canyon.

05:13.188 --> 05:15.607
Now, well, you Boulder folks,

05:15.648 --> 05:17.859
you may have this great
big fancy stadium,

05:17.901 --> 05:19.361
but our little town

05:19.402 --> 05:22.322
has the championship rider
who packs!

05:22.364 --> 05:24.866
(distant cheering and applause)

05:24.908 --> 05:27.327
- What's so urgent?
You gotta ride like now.

05:27.369 --> 05:28.703
- You can't tell
anyone this, okay?

05:28.745 --> 05:30.997
- What?
- You gotta promise me.

05:32.207 --> 05:34.501
- Austin, you're scaring me.

05:36.461 --> 05:39.881
- Give it up for the golden
child with the steel spurs,

05:39.923 --> 05:44.886
Canyon, Colorado's very own
Austin McMurray!

05:44.928 --> 05:47.389
(cheering)

05:53.645 --> 05:55.522
- You gotta help me, okay?

05:55.563 --> 05:57.440
Or our family could be
in a lot of trouble.

05:57.482 --> 05:58.692
- Me?
(scoffing)

05:58.733 --> 05:59.609
What can I do?

05:59.651 --> 06:01.695
- I know your secret.

06:01.736 --> 06:04.364
And you're the only one that
I know that can fix this.

06:04.406 --> 06:05.782
(sighing)

06:14.666 --> 06:15.750
(sigh)

06:18.628 --> 06:19.421
(sighing)

06:19.462 --> 06:21.297
(laughing)

06:21.339 --> 06:22.549
- Whoo!

06:25.301 --> 06:26.845
- Thank you all for coming out!

06:26.886 --> 06:28.346
I'm Austin McMurray.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.807
But y'all probably knew that,
didn't you?

06:31.599 --> 06:33.268
This year is a very
special ride for me,

06:33.309 --> 06:34.936
so I wanna talk to y'all
before we get going.

06:34.978 --> 06:38.898
Boulder Rocky Mountain Rodeos
generously agreed to donate

06:38.940 --> 06:41.234
a portion of tonight's ticket
sales to help wounded vets

06:41.276 --> 06:43.570
in honour of my brother Cash,
who just returned from overseas.

06:43.611 --> 06:46.031
Everybody give a big hand
for him, will you!

06:46.072 --> 06:48.575
(cheering, applause)
All right, right on.

06:48.616 --> 06:50.368
I wanna give a shoutout
to my whole family.

06:50.410 --> 06:53.163
My momma, Isabel McMurray.

06:53.204 --> 06:54.873
My beautiful wife Missy's here.

06:54.914 --> 06:56.499
And then, there's my baby
brother Tuff!

06:56.541 --> 06:58.293
He's got that name for a reason.

06:58.335 --> 06:59.836
- Whoo, whoo!

07:00.754 --> 07:02.589
- But enough of the sappy
stuff, huh?

07:02.630 --> 07:04.215
- Who's ready to see me ride
Hurricane?

07:04.257 --> 07:06.176
(cheering and applause)

07:06.217 --> 07:07.844
Whoo!

07:11.973 --> 07:17.479
- You know, Austin's father,
Dusty McMurray, my good friend,

07:17.520 --> 07:21.441
is looking down on his son
from up above tonight.

07:21.483 --> 07:24.736
So proud of him
for following in the footsteps

07:24.778 --> 07:29.532
of one of the greatest bull
riders the world has ever seen!

07:29.574 --> 07:32.494
(* Duendes  by Quaker City
Night Hawks)

07:35.872 --> 07:37.749
(grunting)

07:46.466 --> 07:48.677
(whispering): I love you.

07:50.845 --> 07:52.013
(exhaling)

07:53.515 --> 07:55.308
- Let's go, boys.

07:55.350 --> 07:57.018
(gate creaking)

07:57.060 --> 07:59.104
(grunting efforts)

07:59.145 --> 08:00.772
- You got it, Austin!

08:01.439 --> 08:02.774
Two seconds!

08:06.611 --> 08:07.904
Three seconds!

08:07.946 --> 08:09.489
(grunting efforts)

08:09.531 --> 08:11.324
Four seconds!

08:11.366 --> 08:12.701
Keep riding!

08:12.742 --> 08:16.037
(bull roaring)
(grunting efforts)

08:18.623 --> 08:20.667
Eight seconds!
(shouting)

08:21.626 --> 08:22.752
(panicked crowd)

08:22.794 --> 08:24.170
- No!
- Oh!
(gasping)

08:24.212 --> 08:25.630
(gasping)

08:25.672 --> 08:28.216
(bull roaring)
- Austin!

08:30.218 --> 08:32.220
(man): Get him out!
Get him out!

08:32.262 --> 08:34.472

08:45.483 --> 08:47.652
(soft music)

09:01.833 --> 09:04.711
* Hey, my little evening star

09:07.297 --> 09:09.632
* How bright you are

09:12.260 --> 09:14.679
* Anywhere you go

09:14.721 --> 09:17.140
(breathing heavily)

09:17.182 --> 09:18.975
* You're not alone

09:22.562 --> 09:26.191
* Rocks and bugs
and angel wings *

09:27.484 --> 09:31.237
* Every little shiny thing

09:33.114 --> 09:35.116
* Anywhere you go

09:36.951 --> 09:38.119
(sighing)

09:38.161 --> 09:39.788
* You're not alone

09:42.999 --> 09:47.128
* You're the north star
and the compass *

09:48.463 --> 09:52.634
* Always finding
something wondrous *

09:53.760 --> 09:56.554
* Anywhere you go

09:56.596 --> 10:00.308

(sighing)

10:17.409 --> 10:18.702
(grunting)

10:19.494 --> 10:20.995
- How's he doing?

10:21.996 --> 10:24.708
- You know how he is.
Steel trap.

10:25.333 --> 10:27.585
Maybe you can get in there
and find out for yourself.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.671
- It's not my job anymore.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.007
(grunting)

10:36.094 --> 10:38.304
- Morning!
- Oh...

10:40.140 --> 10:41.766
Morning.

10:42.267 --> 10:44.352
(sniffling)
- How goes?

10:45.228 --> 10:47.439
- It goes. Yeah.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.983
- Big ride coming up.

10:50.025 --> 10:51.317
(sighing)

10:51.359 --> 10:52.819
- I'm aware.

10:54.237 --> 10:55.572
- You feeling ready?

10:55.613 --> 10:57.824
No one would blame you
if you didn't.

10:58.783 --> 11:00.702
- That's why the small talk.

11:01.244 --> 11:03.538
I kinda think the whole town
would blame me, Missy.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.165
- It's your first official ride.

11:05.206 --> 11:07.500
All I'm saying is you gotta make
sure you're doing it for you

11:07.542 --> 11:09.002
and not for them.
(scoffing)

11:09.044 --> 11:10.712
- You know, around here,
there's no difference.

11:11.212 --> 11:12.380
(grunting)

11:17.510 --> 11:18.803
Uh, hey.

11:20.388 --> 11:22.098
You wanna watch?

11:22.849 --> 11:24.184
Helps to have some eyes on me

11:24.225 --> 11:26.936
before I step out in front
of a huge crowd.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.314
(sighing)

11:29.356 --> 11:32.734
If you don't wanna, I mean--
- No, no, no. I'll...

11:35.153 --> 11:36.237
I'll watch you ride.

11:44.746 --> 11:46.373
(gate creaking)

11:48.583 --> 11:50.001
Cash, wait.

11:50.043 --> 11:52.712
Remember, it's all mental
at this point.

11:52.754 --> 11:54.255
Make sure your head's
in the right place

11:54.297 --> 11:55.423
and you'll be ready.

12:04.307 --> 12:06.059
- Hey, boys.

12:06.101 --> 12:08.019
(nervous sigh)

12:14.693 --> 12:16.277
- Morning.

12:19.614 --> 12:21.866
- You're giving pointers now?

12:21.908 --> 12:24.244
- Well, I'd like to be able
to leave this place

12:24.285 --> 12:27.497
with some peace of mind that
you're all gonna be okay.

12:27.539 --> 12:28.581
- Leave?

12:28.623 --> 12:30.291
(sighing nervously)

12:33.712 --> 12:35.255
(grunting)

12:35.296 --> 12:36.089
- Tuff, come on.

12:36.131 --> 12:37.757
You know I've been restless.

12:37.799 --> 12:38.800
And it's been a year.

12:38.842 --> 12:40.593
(breathing heavily)

12:40.635 --> 12:43.138
Frontier Jeans is looking
for a new brand ambassador.

12:43.179 --> 12:45.682
JB's gonna be at the rodeo,
so...

12:45.724 --> 12:48.935
I have to move on with my life.

12:48.977 --> 12:50.770
I mean, what am I even
still doing here?

12:50.812 --> 12:52.439
- Being part of your family.

12:52.480 --> 12:53.898
(bull roaring)

12:53.940 --> 12:55.400
(breathing heavily)

12:55.442 --> 12:57.152
(bull roaring)

12:57.193 --> 12:58.486
- Buck him, boys!

12:59.279 --> 13:02.490
(Cash grunting)

13:06.161 --> 13:07.620
Ah!

13:07.662 --> 13:09.080
(both sigh)

13:09.706 --> 13:11.291
(laughing)

13:11.332 --> 13:13.293
- Not eight, but still better
than yesterday!

13:14.461 --> 13:15.462
- Whoo!

13:15.503 --> 13:17.047
(sighing)

13:18.048 --> 13:18.798
(sighing)

13:18.840 --> 13:19.799
(vehicle approaching)

13:19.841 --> 13:21.801
- What is that woman doing?

13:21.843 --> 13:23.970
She is gonna run herself ragged.

13:24.012 --> 13:25.764
- Yeah, I think that's her aim.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.349
- I mean, you still run
this place, don't you?

13:28.516 --> 13:30.435
- While it's still around.

13:34.481 --> 13:35.607
- What?

13:42.655 --> 13:43.907
- Ma?

13:44.699 --> 13:46.284
Ma!

13:46.326 --> 13:47.869
What are you doing?

13:47.911 --> 13:49.788
I was gonna do
the feeding today.

13:49.829 --> 13:52.957
- Well, I was up
and work needed to get done.

13:52.999 --> 13:55.126
- It takes two of us
to feed the herd now?

13:55.168 --> 13:56.711
- Well, why not?

13:56.753 --> 13:59.631
We have a couple months to get
the herd up to market weight.

13:59.673 --> 14:01.841
- Are you gonna make it
'til then?

14:02.592 --> 14:04.636
Why didn't you tell me?

14:04.678 --> 14:07.013
I knew things were tight, but if
we're gonna lose the ranch...

14:09.182 --> 14:11.643
- I will handle it.
I always do.

14:11.685 --> 14:14.145
- I'm the foreman, Ma.
It's my job to worry about
this kind of stuff.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.855
- No, no. It's your job
to wake up every day

14:15.897 --> 14:19.067
and work with what you're given.
And the rest...

14:20.026 --> 14:21.903
The rest's in God's hands.

14:21.945 --> 14:23.738
- Well, God's hands haven't
exactly been holding us

14:23.780 --> 14:25.740
real gently lately.
- Mm-mm.

14:25.782 --> 14:27.617
- Get out of there.

14:27.659 --> 14:29.369
I'll take over.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.540
(soft music)

14:35.000 --> 14:37.377
- You can talk to me, you know.
- We talk.

14:37.419 --> 14:39.838
- Why didn't you tell me
the ranch was in trouble?

14:39.879 --> 14:42.007
(scoffing)
- I didn't even tell Tuff!

14:43.008 --> 14:45.927
- You remember,
right after Austin,

14:45.969 --> 14:49.681
you and me, we used to stay up
all night just talking.

14:49.723 --> 14:50.974
I miss that.

14:51.016 --> 14:52.517
(breathing heavily)

14:52.559 --> 14:53.518
- Me too.

14:58.815 --> 15:00.442
You ever notice the rain
around here?

15:01.401 --> 15:04.404
We're either drowning in it
or it's dried up.

15:05.739 --> 15:07.532
It's... just like my grief.

15:07.574 --> 15:11.286
These daily reminders,
they just... just don't go away.

15:13.079 --> 15:14.956
- Is that what I am?

15:14.998 --> 15:18.793
Just a daily reminder
that won't go away?

15:18.835 --> 15:22.005
- You've spent the last year
taking care of me.

15:22.047 --> 15:25.425
And that is more than
any mother-in-law could ask for.

15:26.843 --> 15:31.598
But no one in this family
expects you to give up
your life for us.

15:33.350 --> 15:36.269
Come on.
We got a rodeo to get to.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.022
(soft music)

15:58.667 --> 15:59.626
- Hmm.

16:06.257 --> 16:07.592
- Valeria...

16:11.137 --> 16:13.181
Wha... What are you doing here?

16:13.223 --> 16:15.016
(sighing)

16:17.185 --> 16:20.021
- It...
It's just for the weekend.

16:21.523 --> 16:23.692
- That's all...
That's all you have to say?

16:23.733 --> 16:27.362
After a year of nothing?
Austin died!

16:27.404 --> 16:29.030
My husband died!

16:29.072 --> 16:31.449
I got a sympathy card
from the owner of this shop

16:31.491 --> 16:33.284
and that's more than I got
from my own best friend.

16:33.326 --> 16:34.619
- I'm sorry.

16:35.912 --> 16:37.872
You have to know
I had my reasons.

16:37.914 --> 16:39.457
- Why are you back now?

16:39.499 --> 16:43.003
- I, uh, I have to race
this weekend.

16:43.670 --> 16:44.963
- Come on, you could've skipped

16:45.005 --> 16:46.339
this town on the circuit,
but you didn't.

16:46.381 --> 16:49.175
- I wanted to know
if you guys were okay.

16:50.552 --> 16:52.095
- What did you think, V?

16:52.887 --> 16:54.139
(sighing)

16:56.516 --> 16:57.767
- I should go.

17:01.646 --> 17:03.356
Tell Isabel I miss her.

17:04.566 --> 17:06.985
- You know, if you
really did miss her,

17:07.027 --> 17:09.112
you would tell her yourself.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.534
(soft music)

17:15.702 --> 17:17.704
(indistinct chatter)

17:28.131 --> 17:29.716
Hey, nice one!

17:37.557 --> 17:39.142
Mr. Wooten.

17:39.184 --> 17:40.769
- Missy.
- Hi!

17:40.810 --> 17:43.188
I was wondering if I could bend
your ear for a moment.

17:43.229 --> 17:45.231
- Most certainly.
I haven't seen you since--

17:45.273 --> 17:47.025
- The funeral.
- Yeah.

17:47.067 --> 17:49.194
- We were all so moved
that you could make it.

17:49.235 --> 17:50.570
- Well, Austin was like
family to me.

17:50.612 --> 17:53.365
- And your company's always been
a big part of ours.

17:53.406 --> 17:56.117
I heard that you're looking
for some new brand ambassadors.

17:56.159 --> 17:59.162
Well, I feel like I could be
a good fit.

17:59.204 --> 18:00.663
- You're certainly dressed
for the part.

18:00.705 --> 18:02.707
- Well, I judge mutton
bustings every year

18:02.749 --> 18:04.918
for the kids, and they love it.

18:04.959 --> 18:07.045
Now, it doesn't get more
authentic than this.

18:07.087 --> 18:09.297
I grew up going to these rodeos

18:09.339 --> 18:11.633
and I could sell jeans better
than any influencer

18:11.675 --> 18:13.760
who's barely even ever sat
on a horse.

18:13.802 --> 18:16.721
- Missy, I would be delighted
to set up a test shoot

18:16.763 --> 18:19.849
with the office, but you need to
know the job's out in Houston.

18:20.934 --> 18:22.435
- Houston.
- Mm-hmm.

18:23.269 --> 18:24.729
- That sounds great.

18:26.856 --> 18:28.817
- Daddy? Daddy?
- Mm?

18:28.858 --> 18:30.110
- Hey, Janine.

18:30.151 --> 18:31.277
- Hey there, Jannine.
- Hi, Cash.

18:31.319 --> 18:33.780
- Cash. Janine, would you mind

18:33.822 --> 18:35.198
getting these folks
some tri-tip?

18:35.240 --> 18:37.242
- Of course, Daddy.
- Hello, Hank.

18:37.283 --> 18:39.661
- How're you doing there, Bel?
You holding up okay?

18:39.703 --> 18:42.622
- I'd really prefer it
if you'd stop asking me that.

18:42.664 --> 18:44.916
- Okay, okay.

18:44.958 --> 18:48.086
It's just that I know it's been
a really hard year for you.

18:48.128 --> 18:51.047
- Uh, thank you, Janine.

18:51.089 --> 18:52.424
I just don't have much
of an appetite.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.759
- Oh, I actually
got these for Cash.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.094
- Oh, thank you.

18:56.136 --> 18:57.429
- Well, I'm the mayor.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.931
Of course your well-being
is my concern.

18:59.973 --> 19:01.933
The McMurray ranch
and bull riding

19:01.975 --> 19:03.476
are the hallmark of Canyon

19:03.518 --> 19:05.979
and that's why we need
this young buck right here.

19:06.021 --> 19:08.148
I got some great news.

19:08.773 --> 19:10.942
JB Wooten wants to meet you.

19:10.984 --> 19:12.444
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.446
And he wants to talk
about signing you.

19:15.321 --> 19:17.741
This is Cash's first competitive
ride in years.

19:17.782 --> 19:19.909
Why is Frontier looking
to sponsor him so soon?

19:19.951 --> 19:22.245
- Oh, because they wanna stay
in the McMurray business.

19:22.287 --> 19:24.122
- Ah.
- Look, all he's gotta do is

19:24.164 --> 19:25.874
use his first few rides
to hook him.

19:25.915 --> 19:27.542
- And if he doesn't--
- No, I will.

19:27.584 --> 19:30.462
- Bel, Cash could snap up
the same deal Austin had

19:30.503 --> 19:33.131
in a fraction of the time.
We're talking about

19:33.173 --> 19:34.424
a multimillion-dollar
contract here.

19:34.466 --> 19:35.842
- I don't care, Hank!
I don't care!

19:35.884 --> 19:37.010
My son is not for sale.

19:37.052 --> 19:38.553
- Actually, Mom,
I mean, come on.

19:38.595 --> 19:40.764
This could help
put us back on our feet.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.183
- Tuff said something
to you too?

19:43.224 --> 19:45.226
- He didn't have to.
(sighing)

19:45.852 --> 19:49.731
- Hey, darling. Would you
let Mr. Wooten know that
we're ready to talk?

19:49.773 --> 19:51.358
- Sure thing, Daddy.

19:51.399 --> 19:53.777
He's gonna love you, Cash.
I just know it.

19:55.195 --> 19:57.238
- Okay. Ready?
One, two, three.

19:57.280 --> 19:59.032
(camera clicks)
Great.

19:59.074 --> 20:01.326
- Good job!
- I wanna be a trick rider

20:01.368 --> 20:03.745
just like you one day,
Ms. McMurray.

20:03.787 --> 20:05.413
- Aw, thank you so much!

20:06.706 --> 20:08.166
- All right. Come here.

20:08.208 --> 20:10.794
(chuckling)
I'm so proud of you, little bug!

20:10.835 --> 20:12.420
Now go celebrate
with your friends, all right?

20:12.462 --> 20:13.672
- Mm-hmm.

20:16.007 --> 20:17.467
(chuckling)
- So, that was my niece.

20:17.509 --> 20:20.345
And she's not your only fan
in the family.

20:20.387 --> 20:23.223
I saw you ride
at the stock show, in Denver,

20:23.264 --> 20:24.974
a few years back.

20:25.016 --> 20:26.476
You're incredible.

20:26.518 --> 20:29.187
- Wow, thank you!
- Hardly a grieving widow,

20:29.229 --> 20:31.815
flirting at the same rodeo
her husband died at.

20:31.856 --> 20:33.316
(Tuff whistling)

20:33.358 --> 20:35.902
- Jealousy's riding
strong today.

20:35.944 --> 20:37.654
- Why would I be jealous of her?

20:37.696 --> 20:39.823
- Because your daddy's been
pushing you to marry a McMurray

20:39.864 --> 20:42.075
since you were in diapers,
Missy beat you to the punch

20:42.117 --> 20:44.285
and you've hated her ever since?

20:44.327 --> 20:47.872
- Well, I guess I dodged
that bullet, didn't I?

20:47.914 --> 20:51.126
- And now, Cash is
the next McMurray caught
in your crosshairs, huh?

20:51.167 --> 20:53.461
- Last I heard, he's the only
one available

20:53.503 --> 20:55.922
since you're off
chasing cowboys.

20:55.964 --> 20:58.174
- Oh, they chase me, darling.

20:58.216 --> 21:00.260
Which is more
than I can say for you.

21:01.261 --> 21:02.512
(air kissing)

21:04.264 --> 21:05.724
- People are gonna be lining up

21:05.765 --> 21:08.059
to have him wear
their company logo.

21:08.101 --> 21:09.644
Now you get a chance
to sign him first.

21:09.686 --> 21:11.813
Keep old McMurrays
in the Frontier stable.

21:11.855 --> 21:13.690
- I love everything
you're saying, Hank,

21:13.732 --> 21:15.150
I really do.

21:15.191 --> 21:17.235
But I gotta see the kid ride
a few times first.

21:17.277 --> 21:18.820
- I ride this Sunday.

21:18.862 --> 21:20.530
And I promise, you won't need
the full eight seconds

21:20.572 --> 21:22.032
to see that McMurray talent
runs in my blood.

21:22.073 --> 21:23.533
- But you know...

21:23.575 --> 21:25.702
We're not ready to make
any decision yet.

21:26.286 --> 21:27.912
- I look forward
to proving myself.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.080
- All right.

21:29.122 --> 21:30.623
- All right.

21:31.249 --> 21:32.751
Okay.

21:36.129 --> 21:38.673
(soft music)

21:58.443 --> 22:00.487
- Ugh!
(objects clattering)

22:00.528 --> 22:02.405
(crying)

22:08.244 --> 22:11.081
(gasping)
Valeria!

22:20.215 --> 22:22.050
- Isabel, I...

22:22.092 --> 22:24.928
There's nothing I can say
that will...

22:26.012 --> 22:27.639
- Well, I'll be...

22:28.306 --> 22:29.766
Missy said you were back,

22:29.808 --> 22:31.393
but I had to see it
with my own eyes.

22:31.434 --> 22:32.769
(chuckling)
- Hi, Tuff.

22:32.811 --> 22:34.020
Missy.

22:37.982 --> 22:40.610
I, I don't know what to say.

22:40.652 --> 22:43.154
- You could start by telling us
why you left like you did.

22:43.196 --> 22:44.864
- I can't.

22:44.906 --> 22:47.325
- Why not?
- Tuff, don't.

22:48.660 --> 22:52.288
(clears throat)
- Uh, so... how are you?

22:52.330 --> 22:54.416
How are things?
- We're getting by.

22:54.457 --> 22:56.334
- If there's anything
I can do...

22:56.376 --> 22:59.004
- Well, aren't you only here
for the weekend?

22:59.045 --> 23:00.338
- Yes, but I could--

23:00.380 --> 23:03.383
- We're fine.
Thank you, Valeria.

23:05.760 --> 23:06.845
- Okay.

23:07.762 --> 23:09.264
Well, um...

23:09.305 --> 23:10.974
I won't take up anymore
of your time.

23:12.559 --> 23:13.727
- Wait.

23:14.853 --> 23:16.855
Where are you staying?

23:18.356 --> 23:20.608
- Your old room's still empty.

23:20.650 --> 23:21.901
- Mom.

23:23.361 --> 23:25.697
- Besides, McMurray ranch
never turns down a visitor.

23:27.449 --> 23:30.035
(crickets chirping)

23:31.536 --> 23:34.998
- You guys know that Tuff is
in the hottest band in town.

23:35.040 --> 23:37.375
- I guess if the pond is small
enough, any fish can be big.

23:37.417 --> 23:38.626
(laughing)

23:38.668 --> 23:40.587
- Hey! How are you guys doing?
- Hey.

23:40.628 --> 23:43.256
- Get me one of these beers.
- You drunk?

23:43.298 --> 23:45.175
- Hey, Val!

23:45.216 --> 23:47.260
- Hi, Cash!
- How are you?

23:47.302 --> 23:49.429
My gosh, I haven't
seen you in ages.

23:49.471 --> 23:51.931
- Yeah, it's been a bit.
- Yeah, it has.

23:51.973 --> 23:52.891
(chuckling)

23:53.558 --> 23:55.060
So, how are you doing, Val?

23:55.101 --> 23:57.854
- Mm. Is that your way
of asking me where I've been?

23:57.896 --> 24:01.149
- No, I've seen enough
to know people got their reasons

24:01.191 --> 24:02.192
for doing things.

24:03.401 --> 24:04.736
And those reasons are none
of my business.

24:05.695 --> 24:08.073
- Thanks.
- Of course.

24:10.992 --> 24:14.496
- So, I talked to JB.
I have a test shoot.

24:14.537 --> 24:16.206
Denver, tomorrow.

24:16.247 --> 24:19.918
- What does that mean? Taking
pictures and selling jeans?

24:19.959 --> 24:22.379
(laughing)
- They uh...

24:22.420 --> 24:24.130
They'd want me to move
to Houston.

24:25.465 --> 24:28.510
- You're gonna tell him?
- Not yet.

24:29.302 --> 24:30.428
- Good.

24:31.680 --> 24:33.932
After your pep talk today,
the way he rode...

24:35.350 --> 24:37.394
I haven't seen him like that
in a while.

24:37.435 --> 24:40.480
- Yeah. But I can't stick around
just for Cash.

24:43.608 --> 24:46.611
- You didn't seem
too happy about JB.

24:46.653 --> 24:48.697
You know, usually,
when a family faces

24:48.738 --> 24:51.574
the prospect of making millions,

24:51.616 --> 24:53.618
they're clicking
their heels a bit.

24:53.660 --> 24:56.287
- I've never been much
of a heel-clicker.

24:56.329 --> 24:58.707
Besides, I've been down
this road before.

24:59.791 --> 25:01.418
- Must be hard.

25:01.459 --> 25:04.212
Seeing him follow
in her footsteps.

25:05.547 --> 25:07.924
- Cash hasn't been the same
since he came back.

25:07.966 --> 25:11.136
And I'm not sure bull riding
is helping any.

25:11.177 --> 25:13.680
- Well, maybe the boy
just needs someone to talk to.

25:13.722 --> 25:15.598
I could never replace Dusty.

25:15.640 --> 25:18.518
- Look, what I need
is for you to back off.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.186
Just quit pushing him.

25:20.228 --> 25:22.272
- Bel, you could lose the ranch.

25:22.313 --> 25:25.275
(scoffing)
- Does the whole darn town know?

25:25.316 --> 25:27.694
- Look, all I'm saying,
as a friend,

25:27.736 --> 25:31.114
is that riding runs
in your blood, Bel.

25:31.156 --> 25:34.117
You need it. Your son needs it.
The whole town needs it.

25:34.159 --> 25:35.660
- No. We don't need it.

25:35.702 --> 25:37.912
We have just been living
with it for so long,

25:37.954 --> 25:39.831
we think we can't live
without it.

25:39.873 --> 25:42.125
- Isabel...
- This company has owned us

25:42.167 --> 25:45.337
for far too long. And Hank, I am
not giving them another son.

25:45.378 --> 25:47.297
- There is another option.

25:47.339 --> 25:48.965
It might help dig you out.

25:49.007 --> 25:51.259
But I don't think
you're gonna like it.

25:53.261 --> 25:55.513
(soft music)

25:59.642 --> 26:01.853
- Still having
trouble sleeping?

26:03.772 --> 26:05.315
- Well...
(clears throat)

26:05.357 --> 26:08.193
Yeah. When it gets quiet, my...

26:09.569 --> 26:11.529
...thoughts start
to catch up with me.

26:14.407 --> 26:16.534
(grunting)

26:18.286 --> 26:19.579
(clearing throat)

26:25.794 --> 26:28.171
You know, I could be
a great rider.

26:30.131 --> 26:31.174
Great.

26:32.217 --> 26:33.551
You know why?

26:35.553 --> 26:37.430
'Cause those eight seconds
are the only time

26:37.472 --> 26:39.182
my mind is truly quiet.

26:40.517 --> 26:45.605
There's no fear,
there's no shame, no...

26:46.564 --> 26:50.193
...worries.
Just me on that animal...

26:53.279 --> 26:54.781
Nothing to lose.

26:56.366 --> 26:58.076
- Nothing to lose?

26:59.953 --> 27:04.833
Feel like you got... a whole lot
of people here who love you.

27:09.504 --> 27:12.090
All I know is...

27:13.925 --> 27:18.847
...a happy bull rider
is a safe bull rider.

27:20.432 --> 27:22.100
- Oh, I'm happy now.

27:24.019 --> 27:25.311
- Yeah, me too.

27:25.353 --> 27:27.313
* When the odds are coming in

27:27.355 --> 27:29.607
* And they ain't even

27:29.649 --> 27:32.819
* Even if it's just
to hold your hand *

27:32.861 --> 27:35.363
* And say, "Keep breathing"

27:39.325 --> 27:40.869
- We should, um...

27:42.454 --> 27:44.080
We should go.

27:45.331 --> 27:49.419
You have a... big day coming up.

27:49.461 --> 27:50.920
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

27:50.962 --> 27:52.005
- Yeah.

27:52.839 --> 27:54.341
- Yeah.

27:54.382 --> 27:59.637
* I'll be there
when you need it *

28:05.435 --> 28:07.771
(* Stompin' Grounds
by Reyna Roberts)

28:07.812 --> 28:10.065
* And don't you forget it

28:11.775 --> 28:15.945
* Ain't a thing in the world
that could change it, no *

28:17.864 --> 28:19.616
- Wanna see a mock-up?
- I'd love to.

28:23.036 --> 28:24.829
- It was JB's idea.

28:26.164 --> 28:28.541
How powerful. Right?

28:28.583 --> 28:30.251
- Hmm.

28:30.293 --> 28:31.920
(acoustic music)

28:31.961 --> 28:34.422
- Hyah, come on! Come on!
- Hyah! Hyah!

28:34.464 --> 28:36.508
- Come on now! Hyah! Hyah!

28:36.549 --> 28:38.551
(cows mooing)
- Ooh, ooh, ooh!

28:38.593 --> 28:40.470
(clicking tongue)
- Hyah!

28:40.512 --> 28:41.429
- Get!

28:41.471 --> 28:43.473
- Let's go! Let's go!

28:43.515 --> 28:45.517
Hyah!
- Hyah! Hyah!

28:45.558 --> 28:47.686
- Hyah!
- Hyah!

28:50.146 --> 28:52.107
(grunting)

28:55.318 --> 28:57.112
I got it.
- I know.

28:57.153 --> 28:59.322
You can always use an extra pair
of hands though, right?

28:59.364 --> 29:01.032
- It's what ranch hands are for.

29:01.074 --> 29:02.951
I know they come and go
all the time,

29:02.992 --> 29:04.786
but you were more
than that to us.

29:04.828 --> 29:07.288
You were like family.
- So were you.

29:07.330 --> 29:09.207
You still are.

29:09.249 --> 29:11.626
You're the only family
I've ever known.

29:11.668 --> 29:13.211
- I want you
to be honest with us.

29:13.253 --> 29:14.921
Or at least, level with me.

29:14.963 --> 29:16.923
- 'Cause I'm trying
to protect you.

29:16.965 --> 29:18.341
- From what?
What does that even mean?

29:19.676 --> 29:22.178
- Look, it's just better
for everyone if we leave it.

29:24.097 --> 29:25.640
(sighing)

29:25.682 --> 29:27.726
Why aren't you
bullfighting anymore?

29:27.767 --> 29:29.060
- What kind of question is that?

29:29.102 --> 29:30.979
It's a fighter's job to keep
the rider safe

29:31.021 --> 29:32.814
and I didn't do that.
- Tuff.

29:32.856 --> 29:35.692
- Something was off with him
that night and I didn't see it.

29:39.738 --> 29:41.698
(upbeat country music)

29:41.740 --> 29:43.199
(laughing)
(indistinct chatter)

29:47.704 --> 29:50.790
* Bright lights
Big city *

29:50.832 --> 29:53.877
* Small town
Whoop! So pretty *

29:53.918 --> 29:57.464
* One of these days
I'm gonna have to choose *

30:00.175 --> 30:02.927
- Hey! Thanks again
for yesterday.

30:02.969 --> 30:05.138
- Yeah, well, Isabel missed you.

30:05.180 --> 30:08.099
- Look, I know it's gonna take
a bit, if ever, but...

30:08.141 --> 30:10.894
let me buy you a shot?
For old times' sake?

30:11.561 --> 30:13.146
- Sure.
(chuckling)

30:13.855 --> 30:15.940
- Two shots of bourbon
on his tab.

30:22.197 --> 30:23.782
(moaning)
Ooh!

30:23.823 --> 30:25.533
- Ooh!
- Nice.

30:25.575 --> 30:26.868
- Now that you
bought me a drink,

30:26.910 --> 30:29.621
I guess I owe you a dance.
Come on, partner!

30:29.662 --> 30:30.830
(laughing)

30:32.248 --> 30:34.376
* What's it gonna be?

30:34.417 --> 30:36.378
- You look sad.

30:36.419 --> 30:37.796
Like you're standing here,

30:37.837 --> 30:39.673
wondering why he's dancing
with somebody else.

30:39.714 --> 30:41.800
- Cash can dance
with whoever he wants.

30:43.259 --> 30:45.804
- You know, I always thought you
and Cash would end up together.

30:45.845 --> 30:48.139
You ever feel like you made
the wrong choice?

30:49.766 --> 30:51.893
- Seems you could use
a distraction.

30:59.109 --> 31:02.153
* I want it all
But I can't have it *

31:02.195 --> 31:05.740
- Sorry, she just...
pushes all my buttons.

31:05.782 --> 31:08.076
- Oh, generally, I try to stay
out of bar fights.

31:08.118 --> 31:10.495
Enjoy these events for that
which they were intended.

31:11.454 --> 31:12.497
Dancing.

31:13.665 --> 31:15.959
- So, I still haven't
caught your name.

31:16.001 --> 31:17.919
- Gus.
- Okay, Gus.

31:17.961 --> 31:20.964
Well, I seem to know everybody
at these things,

31:21.006 --> 31:22.882
but somehow, I've never seen you
around here before.

31:22.924 --> 31:24.509
- Been looking around
for a while.

31:24.551 --> 31:26.970
Trying to find the right home.
But I have to admit,

31:27.012 --> 31:29.264
the realtor grossly undersold
the beauty around here.

31:32.142 --> 31:34.853
* There's a farm boy
in the rear-view mirror *

31:34.894 --> 31:36.563
- Your tongue's hanging out.

31:36.604 --> 31:38.440
- What?
- Missy.

31:38.481 --> 31:40.400
- Oh, no.

31:40.442 --> 31:43.236
That's my brother's girl.
Always will be.

31:43.278 --> 31:45.030
- You keep telling
yourself that.

31:45.071 --> 31:46.990
But I've seen you look at her
that way for years.

31:48.992 --> 31:52.037
So, get a move on, huh?
Before it's too late?

31:57.542 --> 31:59.502

32:01.171 --> 32:02.505

32:03.506 --> 32:05.633

32:05.675 --> 32:08.178
- I'm gonna go get you a beer.
- Sure.

32:11.639 --> 32:13.308

32:13.350 --> 32:15.310
- You're Tuff McMurray.

32:15.352 --> 32:16.770
- If you're looking
for an autograph,

32:16.811 --> 32:18.646
my brother Cash is that way.

32:18.688 --> 32:19.981
(chuckling)
- No.

32:20.023 --> 32:23.234
You're a bullfighter, right?
- I was.

32:23.276 --> 32:25.653
- Hope to see you back
in the arena again.

32:25.695 --> 32:28.073
We need guys like you.
(chuckling)

32:30.742 --> 32:34.537
- Hey, uh, do me a favour
and play a slow one?

32:35.497 --> 32:36.247
Please?

32:39.000 --> 32:41.836
- Cash, would you like to dance?

32:41.878 --> 32:43.880
- Uh, no thank you, Janine.
Maybe later. Okay.

32:43.922 --> 32:45.173
- Fine. Whatever.

32:45.215 --> 32:47.008
You're barking up
the wrong tree.

32:47.717 --> 32:49.469
- I'm sorry?
- You don't know?

32:49.511 --> 32:52.138
JB told me some really
interesting news today.

33:04.567 --> 33:06.611
(soft music)

33:16.830 --> 33:20.375
* I feel that weight
inside your bones *

33:20.417 --> 33:22.335
- What? What's wrong?

33:22.377 --> 33:26.715
* It's pressing on your chest
It's heavy as a stone *

33:26.756 --> 33:28.299
- Did I ever tell you how...

33:29.342 --> 33:31.886
...I never liked riding
when I was growing up?

33:31.928 --> 33:33.430
(chuckling)
- Yeah, right.

33:33.471 --> 33:35.890
You were riding as soon
as you could walk.

33:35.932 --> 33:37.892
- No, only 'cause Austin was.

33:37.934 --> 33:40.186
- Well, then maybe
you should give it up.

33:40.228 --> 33:42.731
Save your mom
a whole lot of grief.

33:42.772 --> 33:44.399
- Eh, too late. I'm hooked.

33:44.441 --> 33:46.401
(singing)

33:48.403 --> 33:50.321
Now, you know
when I told you that...

33:50.363 --> 33:52.407
I ride like I got
nothing to lose?

33:52.449 --> 33:55.410
- Huh?
- Well now, it's really true.

33:58.788 --> 34:00.248
(sighing)

34:00.290 --> 34:02.208
- I was gonna tell you
after the rodeo.

34:02.250 --> 34:04.586
I didn't want anything else
messing with your head.

34:05.337 --> 34:06.671
But...

34:06.713 --> 34:08.715
- What, you--
- I...

34:08.757 --> 34:10.258
I have...

34:10.300 --> 34:11.676
I have to leave.

34:12.635 --> 34:14.554
- You have to or you want to?

34:15.805 --> 34:17.349
Look, be honest.

34:18.600 --> 34:20.143
- Both.

34:21.269 --> 34:23.104
Being here is just too hard.

34:23.146 --> 34:26.232
- I know you, Missy McMurray.

34:27.400 --> 34:29.027
You run when you're afraid
of something.

34:29.069 --> 34:30.653
Just like you did last night.

34:39.996 --> 34:45.168
* No matter where you are,
where you go *

34:47.087 --> 34:49.547
- Well, I'll consider the offer.

34:49.589 --> 34:52.592
But if I do decide to sell,

34:52.634 --> 34:55.345
I need to know how the land
is gonna be managed.

34:56.888 --> 34:59.808
Yep. Uh... We'll talk tomorrow.

34:59.849 --> 35:01.142
Bye.

35:02.185 --> 35:04.062
- What, you're selling
the ranch?

35:04.979 --> 35:07.399
- Well, I'm considering it.

35:07.440 --> 35:09.317
If it takes the pressure
off Cash...

35:09.359 --> 35:10.985
- But you can't just give up.

35:11.027 --> 35:12.654
- I can't let another one
of my boys

35:12.696 --> 35:14.572
put his life on the line
just to keep this place afloat.

35:14.614 --> 35:16.783
- I have ideas that could help
save this place.

35:16.825 --> 35:18.284
- All right, I appreciate that.

35:18.326 --> 35:19.994
- No, we could reseed
the pastures,

35:20.036 --> 35:21.621
make the whole place
more drought tolerant.

35:22.497 --> 35:25.250
- I hate having to depend
on that Frontier money.

35:25.291 --> 35:27.836
- Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
Maybe you don't have to.

35:27.877 --> 35:29.337
When you took me in,

35:29.379 --> 35:32.257
this place became the only real
home I've ever known.

35:32.298 --> 35:34.551
And I wanna help save it.
Look, I...

35:34.592 --> 35:37.178
I know there's a lot
left unsaid here, but...

35:37.887 --> 35:40.223
Please? Let me help you.

35:47.355 --> 35:49.482
(country music)

35:54.654 --> 35:55.613
(sighing)

35:58.867 --> 36:00.535
- It's like time stopped, huh?

36:03.121 --> 36:06.207
- I'm leaving.
I got a job offer in Houston.

36:06.249 --> 36:08.668
And, I don't know, I guess...

36:08.710 --> 36:11.087
I figured it would be easier
to go if I knew the McMurrays

36:11.129 --> 36:13.506
at least had you back.

36:13.548 --> 36:16.551
(scoffing)
- You wanna swap me for you?

36:16.968 --> 36:21.181
Not sure everyone else would
think that's such a great trade.

36:21.222 --> 36:23.516
- Cash knows you're leaving,
doesn't he?

36:23.558 --> 36:24.976
- Yeah, why?

36:25.393 --> 36:28.355
- You can't ride.
Not in this state.

36:28.396 --> 36:30.023
(breathing heavily)
- I'm fine.

36:30.065 --> 36:32.067
- Listen to me. Listen to me.

36:32.108 --> 36:34.819
I know you've had a lot of deep
hurt in there, Cash,

36:34.861 --> 36:36.446
but this is not the way
to fix it.

36:36.488 --> 36:38.156
- Yeah, then what is, Mom?
- I don't know.

36:38.198 --> 36:39.449
I don't know how to fix it,

36:39.491 --> 36:41.451
but you're not in the right
head for this.

36:41.493 --> 36:43.661
- Mom, I need to go out there.
- And what?

36:43.703 --> 36:46.206
- And, and... I need to do
something, Mom!

36:46.247 --> 36:48.124
- What? Why? For who?
For what?! Not for me!

36:48.166 --> 36:50.251
You don't have
to do this for me!

36:52.754 --> 36:54.089
(sniffling)

36:54.130 --> 36:55.715
- It should've been me.

36:58.426 --> 37:00.053
- Listen to me. You listen.
Listen to me!

37:00.095 --> 37:02.972
What happened to Austin had
nothing to do with you!

37:03.014 --> 37:05.141
This is not the fight
to bring to that bull!

37:06.226 --> 37:08.269
I am not gonna
watch you do this.

37:08.311 --> 37:09.688
- Ma.

37:15.193 --> 37:17.195
- And what about you, Tuff?

37:17.237 --> 37:19.572
What, you think I should give up
before I even start?

37:19.614 --> 37:21.741
Huh?
- Yeah.

37:21.783 --> 37:23.618
But I know you won't.

37:24.536 --> 37:26.454
That's why I'm going
in there with you.

37:33.128 --> 37:37.048
- And now,
welcome Cash McMurray!

37:37.090 --> 37:39.259
(cheering)

37:41.094 --> 37:42.554
Now, folks,

37:42.595 --> 37:46.433
today marks Cash McMurray's
first PRRO ride

37:46.474 --> 37:48.143
since he stepped away
from the circuit

37:48.184 --> 37:50.937
to join the Armed Forces.
Let's see how he does!

37:50.979 --> 37:52.647
(breathing heavily)

37:56.484 --> 37:58.194
(mooing)

37:59.070 --> 38:02.157
(breathing heavily)

38:07.078 --> 38:08.538
What are you doing, son?

38:08.580 --> 38:10.540
You're gonna take
your wrap or what?

38:16.838 --> 38:19.215
- Cash. Hey, Cash.

38:19.257 --> 38:20.842
It's me. Talk to me.

38:21.885 --> 38:24.596
- Wouldn't it be fitting, huh?

38:24.637 --> 38:26.973
Me going the same way Austin
and my daddy went?

38:27.015 --> 38:28.892
(laughing)

38:28.933 --> 38:30.185
- Look at me.

38:30.226 --> 38:32.354
You gotta stop talking
like that, okay?

38:32.395 --> 38:33.730
You gotta block
all that out now.

38:33.772 --> 38:35.815
These are your eight seconds,
okay? Look at me.

38:35.857 --> 38:38.985
You've got that McMurray spark,
and then some.

38:39.027 --> 38:40.695
Okay? You could be a champion!

38:40.737 --> 38:41.863
All right?

38:42.697 --> 38:43.990
Now do your wraps.

38:44.032 --> 38:46.534
Over, under, over.

38:49.204 --> 38:50.372
(bull roaring)

38:53.041 --> 38:54.209
Breathe.

38:54.250 --> 38:56.711
(breathing heavily)

39:02.717 --> 39:05.887
(panting)

39:09.516 --> 39:11.893
(air horn blasting)
(crowd cheering)

39:11.935 --> 39:13.895
(grunting)
(bull roaring)

39:15.772 --> 39:16.731
Yes!

39:28.827 --> 39:30.328
(buzzer sounding)

39:31.538 --> 39:33.748
(grunting)
- Get him out of there!

39:34.791 --> 39:36.376
- Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

39:37.627 --> 39:39.587
(cheering)

39:39.629 --> 39:40.755
(sighing)

39:40.797 --> 39:43.341
- Eight seconds! Yes!

39:44.467 --> 39:45.760
- Whoo!

39:53.977 --> 39:55.395
(sigh of relief)

39:57.647 --> 39:59.315
(laughing)

39:59.357 --> 40:01.609
- Yes!
(laughing)

40:06.740 --> 40:09.075
Woo-hoo!

40:09.117 --> 40:11.202
- Holy cow!

40:11.244 --> 40:13.872
(laughing)
Boy! Did you see that?

40:13.913 --> 40:15.790
Now you tell me that wasn't
something special.

40:15.832 --> 40:17.667
- Well, Hank's right.
That was impressive, son.

40:17.709 --> 40:19.502
And I'll tell you
something else:

40:19.544 --> 40:21.796
you do what you did here today,
Cheyenne, five months from now,

40:21.838 --> 40:23.256
you and I are gonna be doing
business together.

40:23.298 --> 40:24.591
(laughing)
Huh?

40:24.632 --> 40:26.676
- That sounds great.
- All right. Hank.

40:26.718 --> 40:27.802
- Thank you.

40:29.179 --> 40:31.097
- That's amazing!

40:31.139 --> 40:34.100
(laughing)
- Hi! What's up?

40:34.142 --> 40:36.978
- Cowboy!
(overlapping chatter)

40:38.146 --> 40:39.981
- Eight seconds.
- Eight seconds!

40:40.023 --> 40:41.358
- Felt like two!
(laughing)

40:41.399 --> 40:43.526
(indistinct chatter)

40:43.568 --> 40:45.779
- Thanks for looking after
your brother out there.

40:45.820 --> 40:47.238
- Thank her.

40:47.280 --> 40:49.199
He could be great.

40:49.240 --> 40:52.327
He's not gonna stop 'til
he's better than Austin.

40:53.453 --> 40:55.455
(* Heart on Fire
by Eric Church)

40:57.749 --> 41:01.795
* Couldn't make out any words
but "take me to the levee" *

41:01.836 --> 41:07.592
* That look on your face was
full of wild desire *

41:08.843 --> 41:14.849
* Soakin' my soul in gas
and settin' my heart on fire *

41:16.851 --> 41:18.687
* Heart on fire

41:20.438 --> 41:23.024
* Heart on fire *

41:23.525 --> 41:26.528
- The last time I ask anybody
for anything.

41:27.362 --> 41:30.407
But I need your help.
Both of you.

41:30.448 --> 41:32.409
- Does that mean you're not
selling the ranch?

41:32.450 --> 41:34.577
- I don't know the future
of the ranch.

41:34.619 --> 41:37.997
But I do know
if I wanna fight for it,

41:38.039 --> 41:39.916
I can't do it alone.

41:39.958 --> 41:42.669
- Frontier's expecting me
in Houston next week.

41:42.711 --> 41:45.714
- And if that's what you want,
I respect your decision.

41:45.755 --> 41:47.507
I mean, heck...

41:47.549 --> 41:49.009
I'm trying to give you
all the freedom you need

41:49.050 --> 41:52.012
to not make you feel obligated--
- To push me away?

41:52.053 --> 41:54.347
- Look, I...

41:54.389 --> 41:57.058
I saw what you did
with Cash today.

41:57.726 --> 42:00.979
- I can't be
his good-luck charm.

42:01.021 --> 42:05.358
- No. Missy, that was not luck.
That was skill.

42:05.400 --> 42:08.903
I know that I can't keep Cash
from riding.

42:08.945 --> 42:10.864
But at least with you
whispering in his ear,

42:10.905 --> 42:13.533
I feel like there's
a good chance he'll be safe.

42:15.577 --> 42:18.913
Missy. I'm asking you to stay
and be his coach.

42:20.040 --> 42:22.584
(chuckling)
My Austin, I...

42:22.625 --> 42:24.878
I wouldn't wanna have his rides
if it wasn't for you.

42:30.425 --> 42:32.719
I may have given birth
to three sons,

42:32.761 --> 42:36.222
but I feel blessed to have had
two wonderful daughters

42:36.264 --> 42:37.557
walk into my life.

42:39.267 --> 42:40.935
And I need my girls.

42:41.770 --> 42:42.937
So...

42:44.105 --> 42:46.775
Let's do this. Together.

42:47.400 --> 42:48.818
As a family.

42:49.861 --> 42:50.779
- Family.

42:53.782 --> 42:55.033
- Family.

42:55.825 --> 42:56.910
(chuckling)

42:56.951 --> 42:58.453
(soft music)

42:58.495 --> 42:59.996
- Let's go. Come on.

43:00.038 --> 43:01.414
(clicking tongue)

43:01.456 --> 43:02.957
Let's go.

43:34.406 --> 43:36.574
Subtitling: difuze
