09:05.000 --> 09:06.900
( LAUGHS )

09:07.000 --> 09:09.300
SORRY.

09:09.400 --> 09:11.820
I DIDN'T REALIZE
IT WAS MISSING.

09:11.920 --> 09:14.380
AIN'T LIFE FUNNY?
ANYWAY, THANKS!

09:14.480 --> 09:17.580
OH, AND I HOPE YOU DIDN'T
TAKE YOUR PICTURE WITH IT.

09:17.680 --> 09:20.620
'CAUSE THEY SAY YOU'LL NEVER
WIN AN AWARD IF YOU DO.

09:20.720 --> 09:22.060
WHAT?

09:22.160 --> 09:25.060
THAT'S PROBABLY JUST
AN OLD PARKIES URBAN LEGEND.

09:25.160 --> 09:26.860
I WOULDN'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

09:26.960 --> 09:28.960
( CHUCKLES )

09:33.080 --> 09:34.940
( LAUGHS )
WHOA, THERE.

09:35.040 --> 09:37.580
SEE YOU
AT THE NEXT LODGE MEETING!

09:37.680 --> 09:41.020
( TIRES SCREECH )

09:44.600 --> 09:46.300
( SIGHS )

09:46.400 --> 09:49.980
LET'S JUST
GO HOME.

09:54.960 --> 09:57.580
Mordecai: AND THE PARKIE
GOES TO...BENSON!

09:57.680 --> 09:58.780
FROM PARK.

09:58.880 --> 10:01.060
COME TO THE STAGE
AND CLAIM YOUR PRIZE!

10:01.160 --> 10:03.940
All: ( Chanting ) SPEECH,
SPEECH, SPEECH, SPEECH, SPEECH!

10:04.040 --> 10:06.540
HERE YOU GO,
BENSON.

10:06.640 --> 10:09.200
YOU DESERVE IT.

10:13.280 --> 10:16.140
THIS IS REALLY
THE BEST AWARD I COULD WIN.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.740
I'D LIKE TO THANK
ALL OF YOU GUYS.

10:18.840 --> 10:21.020
NOT JUST FOR BEING
THE BEST STAFF I'VE WORKED WITH,

10:21.120 --> 10:23.900
BUT ALSO BEING THE BEST FRIENDS
I COULD ASK FOR.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.660
BECAUSE OF YOU,
EVERY DAY I COME INTO WORK,

10:26.760 --> 10:28.700
I FEEL LIKE
A TRUE WINNER.

10:28.800 --> 10:30.800
THANK YOU.
