00:20.257 --> 00:22.000
<i>Previously on
Doom Patrol...</i>

00:22.000 --> 00:26.062
You've slipped through
my fingers for the last time.

00:26.097 --> 00:29.033
It's the Chief!

00:29.067 --> 00:31.937
<i>It's all going to be fine.
Chief disappears all the time.</i>

00:31.969 --> 00:35.673
Into a fucking hole?
In the fucking ground?

00:35.707 --> 00:37.642
<i>Take away the ratty
beard and the baggy jumpsuit,</i>

00:37.676 --> 00:40.945
<i>and I swear he looks
just like Flex Mentallo</i>

00:40.978 --> 00:43.347
<i>from the funny book
Danny gave us.</i>

00:43.381 --> 00:45.216
<i>Flex is the key
to finding the Chief.</i>

00:45.249 --> 00:47.284
Dolores? It's me. It's Flex.

00:47.317 --> 00:49.152
- Flex? Oh, God.
- It's me, baby.

00:50.155 --> 00:52.588
- Dolly, stay with me.
- Flex...

00:52.622 --> 00:54.692
Stay with me.

00:58.061 --> 00:59.698
We need you to
turn Grid back on.

00:59.731 --> 01:02.201
If we can find the Beard
Hunter, we can find the Chief.

01:02.234 --> 01:05.736
If I do this, you guys are gonna
have to save Niles without me.

01:05.769 --> 01:07.070
Do it.

01:07.103 --> 01:10.507
I know how to find Niles.
Care to join me?

01:10.540 --> 01:11.643
For Niles.

01:11.676 --> 01:15.313
<i>Finally,
after 13 meandering episodes</i>

01:15.346 --> 01:17.915
<i>of character driven schlock,
we can finally</i>

01:17.948 --> 01:21.618
<i>get to the show that everyone
wanted to see in the first place.</i>

01:21.653 --> 01:24.275
A superhero show!

02:54.677 --> 02:57.481
So?

02:57.514 --> 03:00.151
- How'd your presentation go?
- Eh...

03:00.183 --> 03:01.651
Did the Brotherhood like it?

03:01.685 --> 03:05.423
Not quite. Uh...

03:07.824 --> 03:10.026
Um...

03:10.060 --> 03:11.861
They let me go.

03:11.895 --> 03:13.664
They fired you?

03:13.698 --> 03:16.467
How does the Brotherhood
of Evil fire someone?

03:16.501 --> 03:19.736
And after all
you've done for them?

03:19.770 --> 03:21.538
All your plans...

03:21.573 --> 03:26.573
the electro ray,
the weather control thingy...

03:26.911 --> 03:29.713
the giant robot?

03:29.747 --> 03:33.317
You told me he was going
to bring the city to its knees.

03:33.350 --> 03:34.885
Did you tell them that?

03:34.919 --> 03:39.223
I explained it to them in detail.
The Brain just didn't think...

03:39.257 --> 03:44.257
He just didn't think
I had enough...

03:44.562 --> 03:48.299
-zip.
- So that's it?

03:48.331 --> 03:50.668
He canned you.

03:50.701 --> 03:52.871
He replaced me
with some gorilla.

03:52.903 --> 03:55.406
They decided to bring in
some muscle?

03:55.439 --> 03:57.876
No. An actual gorilla.

03:57.908 --> 04:02.908
He's quite smart, allegedly.
Speaks French.

04:03.213 --> 04:05.015
- You have to go back.
- How's that?

04:05.050 --> 04:08.352
You're going to march into their hideout
and you're going to talk to the Brain.

04:08.385 --> 04:09.486
Make him see the light.

04:09.520 --> 04:12.991
No, honey. I can't...
I can't do that.

04:13.024 --> 04:16.961
I got off easy. This is the Brotherhood
of Evil we're talking about.

04:16.995 --> 04:20.331
Usually when they let
someone go, they let them go.

04:20.363 --> 04:21.833
The only reason
I'm alive right now

04:21.865 --> 04:26.336
is because they don't consider
me a threat physically or...

04:26.370 --> 04:29.607
intellectually. Their words.

04:29.641 --> 04:31.310
I can't do this anymore.

04:31.343 --> 04:34.946
Oh, no, Millie. Please. Look,
this is just a minor setback.

04:34.980 --> 04:37.514
I am gonna be back on top
in no time.

04:37.548 --> 04:40.317
That's just it.

04:40.350 --> 04:43.387
You've never been on top.

04:43.420 --> 04:45.757
You have all these big ideas.

04:45.790 --> 04:48.425
But I am the only one
who buys into them.

04:48.459 --> 04:51.495
I follow you around
like a puppy.

04:51.528 --> 04:55.766
- I'm a real dunce.
- No, Millie.

04:55.798 --> 04:58.802
Millie. No.

04:58.836 --> 05:02.339
Please.

05:02.372 --> 05:03.841
I am going to be somebody.

05:03.875 --> 05:08.545
But you're not.
You're just a nobody.

05:08.579 --> 05:13.528
And that's what
you'll always be.

05:13.916 --> 05:16.317
I'm sorry, Eric.

05:40.778 --> 05:43.148
What the hell
was Mr. Nobody thinking?

05:43.180 --> 05:45.283
Why bring the Chief
all the way to East Bumfuck?

05:45.317 --> 05:48.853
- I don't know. - Yeah.
Fucking Cub Scout jamboree?

05:48.887 --> 05:51.156
Let's forget Mr. Nobody
for a moment, shall we?

05:51.189 --> 05:54.458
We aren't following him.
We are after the Beard Hunter.

05:54.492 --> 05:57.961
According to
Vic's Grid thingamajiggy,

05:57.995 --> 06:01.064
the Beard Hunter has been
in this spot for over a week.

06:01.098 --> 06:02.733
He's stopped searching.

06:02.766 --> 06:04.435
If we're looking
for the Chief,

06:04.468 --> 06:07.637
shouldn't we be trying to figure out
Captain Banana-hammock back there?

06:07.672 --> 06:11.875
I don't know how much use
he's gonna be right now.

06:11.910 --> 06:13.877
It's strange, isn't it?

06:13.911 --> 06:18.815
Getting fresh air after all that
time cooped up in the Ant Farm.

06:18.850 --> 06:21.386
I am so sorry about Dolores.

06:21.420 --> 06:24.689
If we'd known what would have happened,
we wouldn't have brought her to you.

06:24.721 --> 06:28.358
- It's my fault.
- Flex. That's not true.

06:28.391 --> 06:29.826
That contraption in her,

06:29.860 --> 06:32.896
it went off the moment
we recognized each other.

06:32.930 --> 06:36.466
I should have known
they'd be one step ahead of me.

06:36.500 --> 06:39.103
- I killed Dolores.
- No, you didn't.

06:39.137 --> 06:42.841
The Bureau of Normalcy did.
You need to remember that.

06:42.874 --> 06:44.408
And after we get
the Chief back,

06:44.442 --> 06:46.377
we'll make them
answer for it.

06:46.410 --> 06:47.944
We'll make them answer
for everything.

06:47.946 --> 06:51.220
Wait.
We got something up here.

07:00.757 --> 07:02.961
What's a street doing
in the middle of nowhere?

07:02.994 --> 07:04.894
I'm sure they have
a logical explanation.

07:04.896 --> 07:07.432
- They? - Danny. Did I
never mention the sentient,

07:07.466 --> 07:10.935
teleporting, gender queer
street Vic and I hung out on

07:10.968 --> 07:13.204
while Jane lost her shit
and tried to get married?

07:13.237 --> 07:16.107
- Vic mentioned it.
- You really keep to yourself too much, man.

07:16.141 --> 07:20.043
Well, that's Danny,
and you're going to love them.

07:20.076 --> 07:21.177
The fuck?

07:40.964 --> 07:44.002
- Quaint. Perfectly lovely.
- What do we do now?

07:44.035 --> 07:47.237
Just say "Hello, Street"
like a pack of assholes?

07:47.271 --> 07:49.341
Oh, someone's popular here.

07:49.374 --> 07:54.374
Gang, meet Danny. Danny, this
is Rita, Jane and Cliff.

07:59.617 --> 08:04.567
- Danny?
- You two know each other?

08:10.326 --> 08:13.026
She's gone, Danny.

08:16.165 --> 08:17.300
Dolores is gone.

08:41.457 --> 08:43.159
I'm so sorry.

08:43.193 --> 08:48.193
This moment is beautiful and
necessary, and I hate to interrupt.

08:48.466 --> 08:51.235
But we're looking for a lunatic
who eats beard hair...

08:51.269 --> 08:56.206
- Looking beautiful today, sunshine.
- See ya.

08:56.240 --> 08:58.743
Unbelievable.

08:58.775 --> 09:01.025
Ernest. Ernest!

09:04.548 --> 09:06.951
You! Pube Stalker!

09:06.985 --> 09:09.385
It's Beard Hunter.
And I don't do that anymore.

09:09.419 --> 09:12.889
I don't do that anymore.

09:12.923 --> 09:15.259
What are you
fuckwads looking at?

09:15.292 --> 09:17.995
Where is Niles Caulder?

09:18.028 --> 09:19.596
Uh...

09:19.629 --> 09:21.465
- Mmm...
- You ate his beard, didn't you?

09:21.499 --> 09:23.267
It led you here, didn't it?

09:23.299 --> 09:25.602
And your boy wasn't here.

09:25.635 --> 09:27.339
But Danny was.

09:27.371 --> 09:30.573
They got me off the beard hair
and gave me a chance to start anew.

09:30.607 --> 09:35.607
Baloney. Hammerhead,
do something awful.

09:35.712 --> 09:37.948
Give me answers
or I'll give you bananas

09:37.981 --> 09:40.650
up your ass one at a time.

09:40.684 --> 09:42.753
Peels on.

09:54.265 --> 09:56.234
Wait. You've known
this whole time?

09:56.268 --> 10:00.538
Why didn't you tell me
the last time I was here?

10:00.572 --> 10:03.506
Danny, look at us. We've
searched through two continents

10:03.541 --> 10:04.975
and up a donkey's
mustn't-touch-it.

10:05.009 --> 10:06.745
We are hanging on by a thread.

10:06.778 --> 10:10.782
If you can't help us, I'm afraid
the Chief will be lost forever.

10:10.815 --> 10:15.553
And so will we.

10:15.586 --> 10:20.586
-"White Space"?
- I know what the White Space is.

10:23.794 --> 10:26.397
And I know how to get there.

10:43.346 --> 10:44.916
Bad dreams, huh?

10:44.948 --> 10:47.250
Dad.

10:47.283 --> 10:51.554
Dad...

10:51.589 --> 10:54.091
I can understand that.

10:54.125 --> 10:58.028
I just had a doozy
of a nightmare.

10:58.062 --> 11:01.265
The White Space is the area
where there is no story.

11:01.298 --> 11:04.969
The White Space exists
where content doesn't.

11:05.003 --> 11:08.072
It's the space on this page
between the panels.

11:08.105 --> 11:11.475
The White Space. That's
beautiful, heady, poetic.

11:11.509 --> 11:13.945
Now how in the name of fuck
do we get in there?

11:13.977 --> 11:15.212
Well, I have a flex for that.

11:15.245 --> 11:18.749
- You need baby oil or anything?
- Wait.

11:18.783 --> 11:20.686
It can't be that easy.

11:20.719 --> 11:24.755
Mr. Mentallo here strikes a
pose, and then what happens?

11:24.789 --> 11:27.458
Well, then I open up a pathway from
this dimension to the White Space.

11:27.491 --> 11:30.160
Yeah. What Rita's trying to say
is that we need a strategy.

11:30.195 --> 11:32.730
We have no idea what's waiting
for us in the White Space.

11:32.764 --> 11:36.833
We've dealt with Mr. Nobody before.
First, he'll separate us.

11:36.868 --> 11:38.936
And then he'll use our past
to torture us.

11:38.970 --> 11:41.405
Well, we'll just have
to stop him from doing that.

11:41.438 --> 11:44.075
We haven't stopped a goddamn
thing since this started.

11:44.107 --> 11:47.044
- We destroyed the town.
- It got put back together.

11:47.077 --> 11:49.446
Then there was the Decreator,
he ran all over us.

11:49.480 --> 11:50.947
So we summon the Re-Creator.

11:50.981 --> 11:53.650
We nearly ruined the lives
of a group of senior citizens.

11:53.650 --> 11:54.850
They were fucked
when we found them.

11:54.851 --> 11:56.687
Jesus. Knock it off!

11:56.721 --> 11:59.856
Yeah. Our win-loss record
is shit.

11:59.890 --> 12:01.759
We're not making the playoffs.

12:01.792 --> 12:03.928
Who gives a shit?
We're past that.

12:03.961 --> 12:08.066
We've fought and clawed our way through
a ton of fuck ups, and now we're here.

12:08.099 --> 12:10.201
Knocking on the door
to save Niles.

12:10.235 --> 12:15.235
We have to go in.
And we're going in together.

12:16.106 --> 12:19.442
- Let's do this.
- All right.

12:19.475 --> 12:22.080
Everybody, focus.

12:22.113 --> 12:27.113
I need you to focus
on the white space.

12:37.861 --> 12:41.731
Anybody? Anything?

12:41.765 --> 12:44.301
I feel something.

12:44.333 --> 12:45.735
Me too.

12:45.769 --> 12:48.239
Yeah.

12:48.273 --> 12:50.508
Is there something that
I should be feeling right now?

12:50.542 --> 12:54.445
It's like... Wait.
Oh, ooh! Whoa!

12:54.477 --> 12:58.248
Oh, my...

12:58.282 --> 12:59.383
Oh!

13:06.523 --> 13:08.759
What the fuck is going on?

13:08.793 --> 13:11.729
We're all reaching...

13:11.761 --> 13:15.331
We're fucking coming, man!

13:18.395 --> 13:19.335
Shit.

13:30.347 --> 13:32.549
I think I flexed
the wrong muscle.

13:32.582 --> 13:33.918
No shit, dummy!

13:42.860 --> 13:45.897
Oh, yeah!

13:45.929 --> 13:49.432
Oh! Ahhh!

13:52.669 --> 13:55.205
I'll fucking kill you!

13:55.239 --> 13:58.307
Oh, fuck!

14:26.236 --> 14:31.174
Uh... I am so,
so, so, so sorry.

14:31.208 --> 14:33.644
I was shooting for
the splenius capitis.

14:34.712 --> 14:36.514
And I accidentally flexed
my splenius cervicis.

14:36.548 --> 14:38.716
- They're right next to each...
- Just give us a moment!

14:38.750 --> 14:43.750
- Please. - Take as much
time as you need.

14:43.888 --> 14:48.538
I... I'm stupid. I...

14:49.360 --> 14:52.596
Is that better?
Are you more comfortable?

14:52.629 --> 14:54.899
Yeah.

14:54.932 --> 14:58.001
You reinstalled Grid. Good.

14:58.034 --> 15:02.474
Oh. Yeah, I, uh...

15:02.506 --> 15:06.009
I should never
have taken it out.

15:06.043 --> 15:08.946
I'm sorry, Dad.

15:08.980 --> 15:13.183
I screwed up again.

15:13.216 --> 15:15.519
- It's all right, Victor.
- No.

15:15.552 --> 15:18.155
It's really not.

15:18.188 --> 15:20.456
You were right.

15:20.490 --> 15:22.660
I wasn't ready.

15:22.693 --> 15:24.629
I just jumped into
this whole search for Niles

15:24.663 --> 15:29.663
without any idea what
I... what I was dealing with.

15:31.436 --> 15:34.272
That's how Mr. Nobody
got into my head.

15:34.304 --> 15:38.975
He just used everything
that was swirling in my mind,

15:39.009 --> 15:42.879
and my mistrust,
and he twisted it.

15:42.913 --> 15:47.051
Your mistrust of me?

15:47.083 --> 15:52.033
I don't know
what I was thinking.

15:53.090 --> 15:57.394
- I almost killed you.
- No.

15:57.427 --> 16:00.898
I know what you were thinking.

16:00.931 --> 16:05.202
And you were right
not to trust me.

16:05.235 --> 16:10.235
Not all of your memories
are real, Vic.

16:11.576 --> 16:14.211
Thanks for giving me
another shot at this, guys.

16:15.645 --> 16:16.947
Whoo.

16:16.980 --> 16:19.250
Hold up.
Why were you even screaming?

16:19.283 --> 16:22.019
- Huh?
- You can't feel anything.

16:22.052 --> 16:23.888
Um, 'cause...

16:23.921 --> 16:26.289
- Did you fake an orgasm?
- What? No!

16:26.323 --> 16:29.826
I have too much respect
for everyone here.

16:29.860 --> 16:32.062
How could you even...

16:32.096 --> 16:34.664
'Cause I didn't wanna feel
left out, okay?

16:34.697 --> 16:35.865
Aw.

16:35.899 --> 16:38.034
Don't pity me.

16:38.068 --> 16:41.038
- Flex, do your thing.
- Okay.

16:41.072 --> 16:43.408
Everybody, focus.

16:43.441 --> 16:47.443
- You focus.
- Right. Yes.

16:47.477 --> 16:51.081
I'll focus.

16:54.284 --> 16:57.054
- Anything?
- Jesus fucking Christ.

16:57.089 --> 17:02.089
I'm starting to feel like this
entire thing is a waste of time.

17:02.626 --> 17:07.626
Stop it. Paul. That's enough.
Now eat.

17:08.632 --> 17:09.732
Holy shit.

17:09.767 --> 17:12.165
Larry. Language.

17:17.540 --> 17:18.910
Holy shit.

17:18.943 --> 17:21.011
Ready for
you on the docks in ten, Ms. Farr.

17:21.045 --> 17:23.247
The boat scene is all set up.

17:24.848 --> 17:29.849
Jane, no one wants to hurt you,
but you have to go to therapy.

17:30.054 --> 17:31.554
Holy shit.

17:40.464 --> 17:42.165
- Holy...
<i>- Shit.</i>

17:42.200 --> 17:43.367
<i>We get it, Cliff.</i>

17:43.401 --> 17:45.769
<i>Despite your best efforts,
you all waltzed</i>

17:45.804 --> 17:50.307
<i>straight into the very trap
you hoped to avoid.</i>

17:50.340 --> 17:52.608
What day is it?

17:54.612 --> 17:56.814
Only the biggest day
of your life.

17:56.846 --> 17:57.799
<i>That's right.</i>

17:57.799 --> 18:00.218
<i>This was the day
of Larry's big flight.</i>

18:00.250 --> 18:03.054
<i>The day his body would become
a charred Airbnb</i>

18:03.086 --> 18:05.390
<i>for the being
from Planet Dickhead.</i>

18:05.423 --> 18:08.459
<i>Rita was about to stumble
into the drink,</i>

18:08.492 --> 18:12.497
<i>and become forever locked
in her own Battle of the Bulge.</i>

18:12.500 --> 18:15.500
<i>Our girl Jane was due to
get a spike in the neck</i>

18:15.532 --> 18:18.336
<i>that would make all of
the monsters inside her</i>

18:18.368 --> 18:20.204
<i>that much more destructive.</i>

18:20.239 --> 18:25.076
<i>And Cliffy was about to turn his T-top
and his wife into a convertible.</i>

18:25.108 --> 18:26.810
Pretty rough deals all around.

18:26.845 --> 18:29.580
- Fuck off! - <i>You're
the ones that barged into my home.</i>

18:29.614 --> 18:32.084
<i>I should be telling you
to fuck off,</i>

18:32.084 --> 18:35.553
<i>but instead I'm going to offer you the
greatest deal of your pitiful lives.</i>

18:35.586 --> 18:37.888
<i>What if you could have
your old lives back,</i>

18:37.923 --> 18:41.092
<i>minus the horrific tragedies
that destroyed you?</i>

18:41.125 --> 18:42.527
I've had enough
of your bullshit.

18:42.559 --> 18:47.559
<i>I'm not kidding,
Cliff. No one has to die.</i>

18:48.798 --> 18:50.835
<i>Just think about it.</i>

18:50.868 --> 18:55.673
<i>You can have it all back.
All of the glory and glamour.</i>

18:55.707 --> 19:00.576
<i>Your life could be whatever
you want, however you want.</i>

19:01.746 --> 19:04.615
<i>Wouldn't it be nice, Jane,
if you could mitigate</i>

19:04.615 --> 19:08.586
<i>even some of the damage those
nightmares inside of you have caused?</i>

19:08.586 --> 19:10.955
I can make all of that go away.

19:10.955 --> 19:13.657
- What do we have to do? - <i>That's the easy part.</i>

19:13.691 --> 19:18.691
<i>You just have to stay nice
and cozy right where you are.</i>

19:19.363 --> 19:22.733
<i>And stop looking
for Niles Caulder.</i>

19:22.767 --> 19:25.670
And why the fuck should we
believe anything you say?

19:25.702 --> 19:27.071
Because you know this is real.

19:27.105 --> 19:30.974
<i>You know I do almost anything
I set my mind to.</i>

19:31.008 --> 19:33.510
<i>You know I've done it before.</i>

19:33.544 --> 19:34.813
What happens to the Chief?

19:34.846 --> 19:36.713
<i>That's the beautiful part.</i>

19:36.748 --> 19:40.217
<i>You don't worry about him because
if you stay here in this memory,</i>

19:40.250 --> 19:42.487
<i>you won't ever meet
Niles Caulder.</i>

19:42.519 --> 19:44.989
<i>He will cease to exist
in your world</i>

19:45.021 --> 19:47.157
<i>and fade from your memories.</i>

19:47.191 --> 19:50.161
Stop narrating me,
you shithead.

19:50.193 --> 19:55.193
Who you calling shithead,
shithead?

19:55.768 --> 19:56.768
Want one?

19:56.768 --> 20:00.037
<i>Okay,
now you're tempted.</i>

20:00.070 --> 20:03.520
Yeah, I do. I want one.

20:06.444 --> 20:10.847
We aren't the same team you dealt
with back in the donkey, you know.

20:10.881 --> 20:11.982
We're stronger now.

20:12.017 --> 20:14.019
We've all been working
very hard on ourselves.

20:14.051 --> 20:16.755
<i>Work?
You've sat around in a circle</i>

20:16.788 --> 20:19.923
<i>and whined like a C-team
Breakfast Club.</i>

20:21.893 --> 20:26.830
<i>Cliff stole
a watch from an alligator.</i>

20:26.865 --> 20:31.067
<i>Mr. Electricity here
finally came out of the closet</i>

20:31.102 --> 20:35.073
<i>at the tender age of 95.</i>

20:35.106 --> 20:37.976
<i>Jane crawled as deep
into herself as she could</i>

20:38.009 --> 20:43.009
<i>and almost committed
mind suicide or some shit.</i>

20:43.114 --> 20:45.348
<i>You call that work? Please.</i>

20:45.383 --> 20:48.019
- Rita?
- Come in.

20:48.053 --> 20:52.355
We're all set. And I've got
some good news for you.

20:52.390 --> 20:55.259
- You do?
- We fired Henry.

20:55.292 --> 20:56.795
The focus puller?

20:56.827 --> 21:00.364
The one distracting you
with the, uh...

21:00.397 --> 21:04.367
-you know?
- Oh.

21:04.402 --> 21:06.170
What is it now, Rita?

21:06.202 --> 21:09.653
- Want some help?
- Sure.

21:11.809 --> 21:16.247
- Since when do you wash dishes?
- Since...

21:16.279 --> 21:21.117
- I don't know.
- You're going to be late.

21:25.522 --> 21:27.391
You smell so good.

21:27.424 --> 21:29.993
- Am I a good person?
- How so?

21:30.027 --> 21:32.196
As in not a bad person.

21:32.230 --> 21:35.799
Sheryl, what are you
going to do after this flight?

21:35.834 --> 21:40.834
I'm talking about us. Everything
we talked about. All my...

21:41.005 --> 21:44.074
broken promises.

21:44.107 --> 21:45.676
What's going to happen with us?

21:48.244 --> 21:50.079
This doesn't feel right.

21:50.114 --> 21:52.282
- Rita, you're fantastic.
- I am?

21:52.316 --> 21:53.518
Sure you are.

21:53.550 --> 21:56.252
Millions of people across
the globe adore you.

21:56.287 --> 22:00.458
What do you want?

22:00.490 --> 22:04.295
You should go.

22:04.327 --> 22:07.230
We'll be watching.

22:07.263 --> 22:11.669
Now, let's get out there, hmm?

22:11.702 --> 22:16.073
And remind them why.

22:16.105 --> 22:18.375
I come back to a memory

22:18.409 --> 22:22.380
where I have it all again.

22:22.413 --> 22:26.584
And then I got my family...

22:26.616 --> 22:29.920
I start fucking
the nanny again.

22:29.952 --> 22:33.156
Don't be an asshole.

22:33.190 --> 22:36.359
She's right. I should go.

22:36.394 --> 22:40.130
<i>Just like that?</i>

22:40.163 --> 22:42.099
All right, then.

22:42.133 --> 22:44.868
- Last looks. -
<i>Yes, take a long last look.</i>

22:44.903 --> 22:47.571
Because if you leave this tent,

22:47.605 --> 22:49.773
<i>you're going to turn
into a monster.</i>

22:49.807 --> 22:54.011
I'd become a monster long before
my accident. I see that now.

22:54.045 --> 22:59.045
I ruined this life once,
I'm just ruining it again.

22:59.282 --> 23:00.550
I'm still a piece of garbage.

23:00.585 --> 23:05.785
The way I was back here
was so selfish, dishonest.

23:07.858 --> 23:10.361
I ruined this family
years before today.

23:10.394 --> 23:13.263
I may still have
a long way to go,

23:14.898 --> 23:18.702
But I know I've become
a better person since all this.

23:18.736 --> 23:21.806
And my stay with Niles
has been a big part of that.

23:21.839 --> 23:25.711
I have to work on my new life.

23:25.743 --> 23:29.579
Sheryl and the boys deserve better
than anything I could have given them.

23:29.614 --> 23:31.016
We got to find Niles.

23:31.048 --> 23:33.617
<i>Cliff, I know
I've been a shit this season.</i>

23:33.651 --> 23:34.885
But I'm telling you the truth.

23:34.919 --> 23:37.087
<i>This is all real
and you can save your family.</i>

23:37.122 --> 23:39.691
<i>You don't want to do this.
Just stay.</i>

23:39.723 --> 23:42.425
Nah. I call bullshit.

23:42.460 --> 23:43.961
<i>What about John then?</i>

23:43.994 --> 23:46.262
<i>Hmm? You can finally
be with him.</i>

23:46.297 --> 23:50.034
John's lived his life.

23:50.067 --> 23:54.605
I should too.

23:54.638 --> 23:56.540
<i>What on Earth are you doing?</i>

23:56.574 --> 23:58.276
Oh, fuck you.

23:58.309 --> 24:00.744
<i>You have the power
to build the city of the future!</i>

24:00.778 --> 24:02.779
<i>At least
one of you has some brains.</i>

24:02.814 --> 24:06.517
<i>From now on, I'm calling you
"Sensible Jane."</i>

24:06.550 --> 24:09.221
<i>Can you believe the others?
The gall?</i>

24:09.253 --> 24:11.422
<i>At least you know
I'm not the bad guy here.</i>

24:11.454 --> 24:14.491
<i>You know I'm trying to help.</i>

24:17.595 --> 24:21.598
<i>Hammerhead,
what are you doing?</i>

24:21.632 --> 24:23.234
Getting us out of here.

24:23.268 --> 24:27.203
You think you're helping me
and the others?

24:27.238 --> 24:31.675
Well, fuck that!

24:31.808 --> 24:33.577
This was the greatest day
of our life.

24:33.611 --> 24:38.611
This was the day we got
some bite to our bark.

24:39.182 --> 24:41.384
No, no.

24:41.419 --> 24:43.068
Stop. Stop.

24:47.090 --> 24:51.095
It's safer here.

24:51.127 --> 24:54.731
Safe? Safer my ass.

24:54.766 --> 24:59.336
The shit we went through?

25:02.773 --> 25:07.478
It's safer for others.

25:07.510 --> 25:11.816
We can't be around
regular people.

25:11.848 --> 25:14.699
We hurt them. Okay?

25:22.794 --> 25:25.528
I don't give a fuck

25:25.563 --> 25:27.565
about regular people.

25:27.597 --> 25:30.968
We're supposed
to protect the girl.

25:32.403 --> 25:37.202
<i>Well, shit.</i>

25:39.210 --> 25:42.378
All I remember
from the accident

25:42.413 --> 25:45.548
is waking up on the lawn.

25:45.583 --> 25:50.583
- Mom was next to me, but she was...
- No.

25:53.356 --> 25:56.125
She was still alive.

25:56.160 --> 25:57.162
What?

25:57.194 --> 25:59.597
Each of you were barely
hanging in there.

25:59.631 --> 26:02.333
We rushed you to the S.T.A.R.'s
experimental surgical center.

26:02.365 --> 26:05.402
Both of us?

26:05.435 --> 26:08.605
It quickly became apparent

26:08.638 --> 26:11.974
I would only be able
to save one of you.

26:12.009 --> 26:13.358
Then why?

26:17.381 --> 26:22.085
Why did you save me?

26:22.118 --> 26:24.989
It was Niles.

26:25.022 --> 26:29.393
He argued that you were
the better physical candidate

26:29.425 --> 26:32.997
to accept the biotechnology.

26:33.030 --> 26:37.230
But I still wouldn't listen.

26:38.603 --> 26:41.404
Then he made me realize
one simple fact.

26:41.439 --> 26:43.375
Saving you...

26:43.407 --> 26:47.912
would be the only choice
your mother would make.

26:47.945 --> 26:52.945
The only choice she would
let me make.

26:55.886 --> 26:59.957
So I let her go.

26:59.990 --> 27:03.594
No...

27:03.627 --> 27:07.230
But I remember...

27:07.263 --> 27:10.000
she was on the lawn

27:10.034 --> 27:12.403
in front of the house.

27:12.436 --> 27:17.207
- That was...
- That was a story you were told.

27:17.240 --> 27:19.243
A simple lie,

27:19.277 --> 27:23.748
told over and over again
while you recovered.

27:23.780 --> 27:27.417
Every day...

27:27.451 --> 27:30.750
until you believed it.

27:33.023 --> 27:36.226
So, you didn't corrupt
my programming.

27:36.259 --> 27:38.962
Uh-uh.

27:38.997 --> 27:41.632
You messed with
my actual memories.

27:41.665 --> 27:44.035
I don't expect you
to forgive me.

27:44.067 --> 27:45.670
But I can hope that you know
how sorry...

27:45.670 --> 27:48.839
Do you know how hard it was

27:48.873 --> 27:52.472
carrying this for years?

27:54.011 --> 27:56.181
Why didn't you tell me?

27:56.213 --> 28:00.451
- Why did you do this to me?
- I was afraid.

28:00.484 --> 28:03.387
I was certain
it would destroy our family

28:03.421 --> 28:08.421
if you knew I had to make the
choice to let your mother pass.

28:08.925 --> 28:11.662
I was afraid

28:11.695 --> 28:13.263
of having you hate me.

28:13.298 --> 28:15.532
So you let me shoulder
the blame instead.

28:15.566 --> 28:17.734
I didn't realize...

28:17.768 --> 28:19.936
how destructive

28:19.971 --> 28:23.473
my dishonesty was
until it was too late.

28:23.507 --> 28:27.557
The story was too powerful.

28:31.781 --> 28:36.781
It made you Cyborg
as much as the surgery.

28:37.354 --> 28:38.422
Mmm.

28:38.454 --> 28:40.724
Where are you going?

28:40.758 --> 28:43.661
I got some people
I can actually trust.

28:43.693 --> 28:45.528
Friends.

28:45.563 --> 28:48.198
And they need my help.

28:52.303 --> 28:54.271
<i>Look at these nimrods.</i>

28:54.305 --> 28:56.374
<i>I handed them
the happy ending</i>

28:56.407 --> 29:00.144
<i>they wasted decades
pining for.</i>

29:00.178 --> 29:05.083
<i>And what did they do?
They shit all over it.</i>

29:05.115 --> 29:07.117
<i>Now they were lost and alone</i>

29:07.151 --> 29:12.151
<i>with nothing but my narration
to keep them company.</i>

29:13.490 --> 29:17.227
<i>Most likely, forever.</i>

29:18.730 --> 29:23.500
But deep down, Rita knew
everything was going to be fine.

29:23.534 --> 29:25.169
Totally fine.

29:25.202 --> 29:26.770
So forward she marched.

29:26.804 --> 29:28.204
<i>Um,
what are you doing?</i>

29:28.205 --> 29:30.942
I'm sick of having someone else
tell my story.

29:30.974 --> 29:33.009
Badly, I might add.

29:33.044 --> 29:37.048
Therefore, I shall be narrating
my own tale from now on.

29:37.080 --> 29:38.784
So she marched forward.

29:38.817 --> 29:41.318
- <i>But you can't just narrate...
- Ever forward.</i>

29:41.352 --> 29:43.153
- <i>Stop it!
- Ever onward.</i>

29:43.186 --> 29:45.455
- <i>It doesn't work like that!
- Eventually,</i>

29:45.489 --> 29:48.125
in a stunning twist,

29:48.159 --> 29:53.159
Rita and her friends
found one another.

29:54.530 --> 29:56.634
Cliff!

29:56.666 --> 29:57.768
Rita!

29:57.801 --> 29:59.636
Thought I heard you.

29:59.670 --> 30:01.771
Hey, Rita.

30:01.806 --> 30:03.307
Were you just in my head?

30:03.340 --> 30:05.644
I've decided to try my hand
at narrating.

30:05.676 --> 30:09.079
If you want the plum roles, sometimes
you have to write them yourself.

30:09.113 --> 30:11.182
Wait. Where's Jane?

30:11.215 --> 30:13.183
You all know she moves
at her own pace.

30:13.218 --> 30:17.989
- Chief! - Let's
grab him and bolt.

30:18.021 --> 30:19.324
You shouldn't have come here.

30:19.356 --> 30:22.859
Did you really think
it would be that easy?

30:22.894 --> 30:25.997
If you want Niles,
you have to go through me.

30:26.029 --> 30:27.464
Shouldn't be a problem.

30:27.499 --> 30:30.634
Real you looks like
a fucking dweeb to me.

30:30.667 --> 30:32.670
Oh.

30:32.702 --> 30:35.306
Right.

30:35.339 --> 30:37.075
I suppose this is
hardly appropriate

30:37.107 --> 30:42.107
for the big, boring
punch 'em up climax.

30:47.817 --> 30:50.253
Is this better?

30:53.423 --> 30:55.292
Now,

30:55.326 --> 30:58.096
who wants to get
ripped apart first?

30:58.128 --> 31:02.267
And why
do you want to fight?

31:02.299 --> 31:04.201
Dr. Harrison?

31:04.234 --> 31:06.770
We're getting ready for
the big superhero fight.

31:06.804 --> 31:08.472
This is who you turn into?

31:08.506 --> 31:10.208
What are you
overcompensating for?

31:10.240 --> 31:14.444
- I'm not overcompensating.
- Please.

31:14.478 --> 31:17.414
This form.

31:17.449 --> 31:22.449
This phony darkness. This childish
display of sinister power.

31:22.920 --> 31:24.955
That's ridiculous.

31:24.989 --> 31:27.892
A, I am sinister and dark.

31:27.924 --> 31:29.693
B, I'm powerful enough

31:29.728 --> 31:32.329
to control this entire streaming
service if I wanted to.

31:32.363 --> 31:33.898
What the fuck is going on?

31:33.932 --> 31:38.670
We are witnessing someone with a
classic delusional personality.

31:38.702 --> 31:41.806
Most likely caused by a
lifelong sense of inferiority.

31:41.838 --> 31:44.040
- Oh, bullshit.
- Is it?

31:44.075 --> 31:46.778
You claim you can control
this television program,

31:46.811 --> 31:50.114
yet, Rita here was easily
able to wrest control by

31:50.147 --> 31:51.816
providing her own narration.

31:51.848 --> 31:53.317
She got lucky.

31:53.351 --> 31:56.753
Or maybe the source
of your problem is a woman.

31:56.787 --> 31:58.189
That is not...

31:58.221 --> 32:03.221
You're just a nobody. And
that's what you'll always be.

32:05.096 --> 32:06.145
Millie.

32:13.069 --> 32:14.238
How are you doing this?

32:14.271 --> 32:16.840
You're doing all this
because you were dumped?

32:16.874 --> 32:19.309
I get it.
Standard stuff.

32:19.344 --> 32:22.046
- Basic.
- I am not basic.

32:22.078 --> 32:24.048
You don't want to be.

32:24.080 --> 32:25.717
You want to be original.

32:25.750 --> 32:29.987
Despite all the sarcastic
comments and judgments...

32:30.020 --> 32:32.088
- He's sad.
- He's like us.

32:32.123 --> 32:33.590
How dare you?

32:33.590 --> 32:35.660
- You were twisted before you were twisted.
- Maybe.

32:35.693 --> 32:39.230
Except now, I have power.
And it's time to die.

32:39.262 --> 32:41.199
I don't want to fight.

32:41.231 --> 32:42.634
- What?
- I don't know.

32:42.666 --> 32:45.169
- I feel kind of bad now that I know you.
- Me too.

32:45.202 --> 32:47.337
- Yeah.
- Let us help you.

32:47.372 --> 32:50.606
- Let Niles into your heart.
- No!

32:50.641 --> 32:51.876
This is not right.

32:51.910 --> 32:55.813
You are not going to pity me
any longer. Fight or don't.

32:55.846 --> 32:57.114
But I'm going to...

33:01.951 --> 33:04.821
Fuck.

33:04.855 --> 33:08.959
Booyah.

33:08.992 --> 33:11.595
What? The guy said
not to pity him.

33:11.627 --> 33:13.696
Is that it?

33:13.730 --> 33:17.201
I believe it might be.

33:17.234 --> 33:19.136
What do you say, Chief?

33:19.170 --> 33:20.872
You ready to go home?

33:20.905 --> 33:24.875
You might wanna brace yourself.
We kind of trashed the place.

33:24.910 --> 33:27.612
- We fought a whole cult in there.
- And each other.

33:27.645 --> 33:30.213
I had a rat in me.

33:30.248 --> 33:31.650
It's a story for another time.

33:31.682 --> 33:34.251
It was quite the wild
ride, Chief, finding you.

33:34.285 --> 33:39.285
I think you all found
much more than me.

33:49.232 --> 33:51.868
Oh, where are they all?

33:51.902 --> 33:54.372
Where are you all?

33:54.404 --> 33:57.642
Sorry, sorry,
I was putting on my face.

33:57.675 --> 33:59.176
You think I wake up
looking this pretty?

33:59.210 --> 34:01.546
Morning briefing begins
promptly at 7.00 a.m.

34:01.578 --> 34:03.548
If we want to be a team,
we have to make the effort.

34:03.580 --> 34:07.750
Absolutely. That's why I was down
here at ten to waiting on all of you.

34:07.785 --> 34:09.219
Thank you, Rita.

34:09.253 --> 34:11.190
Setting the example as always.

34:11.222 --> 34:15.126
Hey, do you use your powers to stick your
nose all the way up the Chief's ass or...

34:15.159 --> 34:18.128
- Boom.
- Sorry, everyone. I was on my run.

34:18.161 --> 34:20.063
Hey, way to keep it tight,
Hawkman.

34:20.097 --> 34:23.702
Might we start
our briefing, please?

34:23.735 --> 34:27.405
Briefing? Please. Let's
call it what it is. Breakfast.

34:27.438 --> 34:28.773
Chocolate chip pancakes?

34:28.806 --> 34:30.672
You ate all the chocolate
chips yesterday.

34:30.708 --> 34:32.577
Damn.

34:32.610 --> 34:34.478
Well, let's get
to the task at hand.

34:34.512 --> 34:37.447
The Brotherhood of Evil
is on the move again.

34:37.481 --> 34:39.150
Last seen in Brussels.

34:41.585 --> 34:44.556
Looks like the task at
hand has changed. Come on.

34:44.588 --> 34:47.224
Such a shame to leave
all this food to spoil.

34:47.257 --> 34:49.927
You just look after
your own bacon.

34:49.960 --> 34:54.097
Hmm.

35:03.407 --> 35:05.108
What do you think it is?

35:05.141 --> 35:08.045
Maybe it's that.

35:12.516 --> 35:13.951
Chief,
are you seeing this?

35:13.983 --> 35:16.983
How could I miss it?

35:21.893 --> 35:24.362
How do we start it
and how do we finish it?

35:24.394 --> 35:26.463
Same as always.
Try talking to it.

35:26.496 --> 35:29.733
I got this. I speak robot.

35:29.768 --> 35:34.768
Hey, big fella.
You friend or foe?

35:39.510 --> 35:42.646
Oh. He's foe as fuck.

35:42.679 --> 35:44.382
Looks like it's going
to be the hard way.

35:44.414 --> 35:46.451
As long as the regular people
are out of danger.

35:46.483 --> 35:50.083
Fuck the regular people.

35:54.724 --> 35:56.893
No!

35:56.927 --> 35:59.463
Oh, where are they all?

35:59.496 --> 36:01.800
Where are you all?

36:01.833 --> 36:05.402
Sorry, sorry,
I was putting on my face.

36:05.436 --> 36:06.836
You think I wake up
looking this pretty?

36:06.838 --> 36:09.074
Morning briefing begins
promptly at 7.00 a.m.

36:09.106 --> 36:11.143
If we want to be a team,
we have to make the effort.

36:11.143 --> 36:14.844
Absolutely. That's why I was down
here at ten to waiting on all of you.

36:14.878 --> 36:16.280
Thank you, Rita.

36:16.313 --> 36:18.215
Sorry, everyone.
I was on my run.

36:18.248 --> 36:20.217
Hey, way to keep it tight,
Hawkman.

36:20.251 --> 36:22.920
Might we start
our briefing, please?

36:22.954 --> 36:26.789
Briefing? Please. Let's
call it what it is. Breakfast.

36:26.824 --> 36:27.992
Chocolate chip pancakes?

36:28.025 --> 36:29.893
You ate all the chocolate
chips yesterday.

36:29.927 --> 36:33.030
Damn.

36:33.065 --> 36:36.333
Looks like the task at
hand has changed. Come on.

36:36.367 --> 36:38.869
Such a shame to leave
all this food to spoil.

36:38.903 --> 36:41.637
You just look after
your own bacon.

36:41.672 --> 36:45.775
Hmm.

36:56.288 --> 36:59.155
- Are you seeing this, Chief? - <i>How could I miss it?</i>

36:59.190 --> 37:03.960
Hey, big fella.
You friend or foe?

37:03.994 --> 37:06.664
Oh. He's foe as fuck.

37:06.697 --> 37:07.932
Looks like it's going
to be the hard way.

37:07.965 --> 37:10.400
As long as the regular people
are out of danger.

37:10.434 --> 37:14.034
Fuck the regular people.

37:20.577 --> 37:21.478
N...

37:21.512 --> 37:22.512
Looks like the task

37:22.512 --> 37:24.615
at hand has changed.
Come on.

37:24.648 --> 37:28.318
Such a shame to see
all this food spoil.

37:28.351 --> 37:30.054
Just...

37:30.086 --> 37:33.824
Uh...

37:33.856 --> 37:36.800
Be careful, please.

37:51.909 --> 37:54.144
How do we start it
and how do we finish it?

37:54.177 --> 37:58.483
Same as always. Try...

37:58.516 --> 38:01.365
Run. Run like hell!

38:13.563 --> 38:15.865
Looks like the task at
hand has changed. Come on.

38:18.702 --> 38:20.771
What do you think it is?

38:20.804 --> 38:22.005
Maybe it's that.

38:25.576 --> 38:28.378
Hey, big fella.
You friend or foe?

38:28.411 --> 38:30.079
No!

38:30.114 --> 38:31.148
Chocolate chip pancakes?

38:31.182 --> 38:34.851
- Are you seeing this, Chief?
- Try talking to it.

38:34.851 --> 38:35.818
No, no!

38:35.820 --> 38:37.722
You think I wake up
looking this pretty?

38:37.755 --> 38:39.922
- Foe as fuck.
- Run like hell!

38:41.925 --> 38:43.193
No! No!

38:43.226 --> 38:44.827
You just mind your own bacon.

38:45.929 --> 38:47.532
All the way up
the Chief's ass?

38:47.565 --> 38:50.300
Looks like it's going
to be the hard way.

38:50.333 --> 38:52.969
No! No!

38:54.438 --> 38:56.807
Chocolate chip pancakes?

38:56.840 --> 38:59.175
Looks like the task
at hand has changed.

38:59.210 --> 39:00.443
Run!

39:00.478 --> 39:02.246
Run like hell!

39:05.550 --> 39:09.119
Stop!

39:09.152 --> 39:11.702
Not another step.

39:16.460 --> 39:18.128
What's the matter with you?

39:18.161 --> 39:20.831
You can't go. It's a trap.

39:20.864 --> 39:23.367
He's doing this.
He's got us.

39:23.402 --> 39:26.202
You mind filling us in on what
the hell you're talking about?

39:26.237 --> 39:28.639
Mr. Nobody.

39:28.672 --> 39:30.974
He's torturing us.

39:31.007 --> 39:32.710
Killing you...

39:32.744 --> 39:35.445
But me, he's making me
watch you die

39:35.478 --> 39:37.547
again and again and again.

39:37.581 --> 39:40.016
- That's impossible.
- Yeah, we beat him a year ago.

39:40.050 --> 39:44.221
No. You can't.

39:44.255 --> 39:45.722
I should have known.

39:45.757 --> 39:50.407
What the hell is going on here?

39:52.130 --> 39:57.130
And who the hell
are you supposed to be?

39:57.534 --> 40:00.237
I was wondering
if you'd show up.

40:00.271 --> 40:03.373
One of you better start
explaining some shit quick.

40:07.679 --> 40:10.914
The genius finally
figured it out.

40:10.949 --> 40:13.983
The Vic that shot Mr. Nobody...

40:14.018 --> 40:16.717
was me.

40:33.436 --> 40:35.505
That was me all along.

40:39.844 --> 40:44.494
Whew. That was getting tedious.

40:45.248 --> 40:46.416
No way.

40:46.449 --> 40:49.152
How the hell
did we get back here?

40:49.186 --> 40:51.422
Or maybe you never left.

40:51.454 --> 40:53.324
Good God.

40:53.358 --> 40:57.161
If stupidity were a superpower,
you would be goddamn Superman.

40:57.195 --> 40:59.496
Can someone tell me
what the hell is going on here?

40:59.530 --> 41:01.565
And why are we not
beating this guy's ass?

41:01.599 --> 41:03.634
Oh, they already tried that.

41:03.668 --> 41:05.603
It's far too convoluted
to go into right now.

41:05.635 --> 41:07.739
You can look out for it during

41:07.771 --> 41:11.009
the "previously on" part of
the next episode.

41:11.041 --> 41:16.041
The moral is basically
there is no beating me.

41:16.347 --> 41:19.717
Not now. Not ever.

41:19.751 --> 41:22.353
But you can be free of me.

41:22.385 --> 41:24.588
That's not so bad, right?

41:24.621 --> 41:26.489
But how would you do that?

41:26.523 --> 41:30.527
What is it that sets us free?

41:30.561 --> 41:32.931
You know the answer, Niles.

41:32.963 --> 41:37.001
I could go back
to destroying them again.

41:37.034 --> 41:39.938
I mean, they're
basically dead anyway.

41:39.971 --> 41:44.971
And I'm happy to work Cyborg
into the mix.

41:55.385 --> 41:58.655
The truth.

41:58.688 --> 42:02.025
The truth shall set you free.

42:02.059 --> 42:03.594
There it is!

42:03.628 --> 42:05.630
That's what
all this has been about?

42:05.663 --> 42:09.233
All the anguish, the agony?

42:09.266 --> 42:12.503
Um... duh.

42:12.536 --> 42:15.739
Yes.

42:15.773 --> 42:17.608
But look what else
has happened.

42:17.641 --> 42:19.177
Check out
your little ragtag crew.

42:19.210 --> 42:21.179
I mean, they couldn't even leave
the house without screwing up.

42:21.211 --> 42:23.014
And now they've made it
all the way here.

42:23.047 --> 42:26.349
And you are the only thing
that can save them.

42:26.382 --> 42:30.521
It's kind of beautiful, no?

42:30.554 --> 42:33.123
Go on, Niles.

42:33.157 --> 42:36.157
Tell them the truth.

42:38.996 --> 42:40.264
I can't.

42:40.297 --> 42:45.297
Yes, you can.
You can tell us anything.

42:45.635 --> 42:47.070
It's all right, Niles.

42:47.105 --> 42:50.442
If there is one thing we've all
learned from this nightmare,

42:50.474 --> 42:55.012
it's that there's no need
for secrets between us.

42:55.045 --> 43:00.045
It's okay.
You can do this, Chief.

43:07.992 --> 43:12.992
