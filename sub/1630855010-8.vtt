<i>Authorities have
identified a person of interest</i>

00:13.607 --> 00:17.073
<i>in the mysterious death of
Treasury Official Edward Homm.</i>

00:17.173 --> 00:18.940
That's my Stacy.
Someone's at the door.

00:19.040 --> 00:21.240
The fuck?
I was afraid of that.

00:22.573 --> 00:24.507
Kills a guy with
a fire extinguisher

00:24.607 --> 00:26.740
and suddenly he's in MI5.

00:26.840 --> 00:28.140
- You said he was okay.
- He's fine.

00:28.240 --> 00:30.473
<i>Edward Homm is the story here.</i>

00:30.573 --> 00:32.407
<i>Think about it. Can you think
of one other person</i>

00:32.507 --> 00:34.673
<i>in the last 2,000 years?
My source, Zaius,</i>

00:34.773 --> 00:38.973
<i>said he's gonna get me proof
that Ed is not dead.</i>

00:39.073 --> 00:41.306
Weir didn't kill anybody.
I have proof.

00:41.407 --> 00:44.273
Oh, you figured out the stuff
in the briefcase?

00:44.373 --> 00:47.140
Whoever has this info
controls everything.

00:47.240 --> 00:48.740
- Where are you going?
- To find him.

00:48.840 --> 00:50.073
Maybe he went to his ex-wife's.

00:50.173 --> 00:51.673
I didn't know Weir
even had an ex.

00:51.773 --> 00:52.673
It's really good you came.

00:52.773 --> 00:53.940
It doesn't hurt

00:54.040 --> 00:55.707
to look like
successful co-parents

00:55.807 --> 00:57.007
every once in a while.

00:57.107 --> 00:58.339
Sir?

00:58.440 --> 00:59.673
What's this?

00:59.773 --> 01:00.707
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

01:00.807 --> 01:02.107
What can I offer you

01:02.207 --> 01:03.973
to make you forget
this file ever existed?

01:04.073 --> 01:05.440
Oh, I thought you'd never ask.

01:05.540 --> 01:07.607
I'd like to be made
the head of the task force

01:07.707 --> 01:09.073
that's tracking down John Weir.

01:09.173 --> 01:10.473

01:13.140 --> 01:14.473
This wasn't about winning
the presidency.

01:14.573 --> 01:16.940
This was about passing
a piece of legislation

01:17.040 --> 01:18.272
that the senator campaigned on.

01:18.407 --> 01:20.073
And when it does,
Crowley gains access

01:20.173 --> 01:22.973
to thousands of data points
on every single American.

01:23.073 --> 01:25.007
- Your father is using you.
- Liar!

01:28.607 --> 01:31.007
Someone's telling you
what to fucking say?

01:32.140 --> 01:33.840
<i>Hello, John.</i>

01:33.940 --> 01:35.240
Been running
an op on me, Dad?

01:35.407 --> 01:36.507
Jesus Christ!

01:36.607 --> 01:38.707
Crowley wants no loose ends

01:38.807 --> 01:40.007
in the Homm operation.

01:40.107 --> 01:41.873
He just fucking
outplayed me, John.

01:41.973 --> 01:43.007
I'm so sorry.

01:43.107 --> 01:44.773
No more apologizing.

01:44.873 --> 01:47.073
Just tell me that
we're gonna work together

01:47.173 --> 01:50.873
to stop this motherfucker
once and for all.

01:56.407 --> 01:58.473
Another week? Seriously?

01:58.573 --> 02:00.607
You were supposed to be done
a month ago.

02:02.040 --> 02:04.407
Yeah, but what about my job,
my career?

02:05.607 --> 02:08.407
I know things happen,
but I mean...

02:09.440 --> 02:12.807
We can talk about this when
you're back, whenever that is.

02:12.907 --> 02:14.272
It's giving me a headache

02:14.407 --> 02:17.407
and that is the last thing
I need right now.

04:53.773 --> 04:55.306
<i>but the D.C. circuit court</i>

04:55.407 --> 04:56.773
<i>has been shut indefinitely</i>

04:56.873 --> 04:57.940
<i>- for fear of further violence.</i>
- It's begun.

04:58.040 --> 04:59.607
Crowley?
- Yeah.

04:59.707 --> 05:03.007
It's like the most
powerful court in the country.

05:03.106 --> 05:04.807
Crowley's just shut it down.

05:04.907 --> 05:07.840
Then he'll probably pack it
full of his own people,

05:07.940 --> 05:09.306
or just not reopen it again.

05:09.407 --> 05:11.206
He-He's taking over.

05:11.306 --> 05:14.573
He paralyzes the courts,
then what?

05:15.440 --> 05:19.473
We were in, uh, in India,
in Mumbai, once.

05:20.239 --> 05:22.440
We were looking out
over the slums.

05:23.640 --> 05:27.540
And he said, "They should all be
put down like rabid dogs."

05:28.440 --> 05:30.807
Then he said, "The one thing
this country has got right

05:30.907 --> 05:32.407
is the caste system."

05:32.407 --> 05:35.740
Uh, "People know their place
and they're kept there."

05:37.239 --> 05:40.272
He'll build the country
he's always wanted.

05:40.407 --> 05:43.139
Ruled over by a privileged few.

05:43.239 --> 05:45.072
He'll create
a permanent underclass,

05:45.172 --> 05:47.072
women in the home,

05:47.172 --> 05:49.540
homosexuals in the closet.

05:49.640 --> 05:53.106
Or, better still,
buried in the ground.

05:54.407 --> 05:57.039
It's the world
of a hundred years ago.

05:57.139 --> 05:59.172
His world.

06:00.172 --> 06:02.272
God help us all.

06:06.172 --> 06:07.607
Let's talk about next steps.

06:07.707 --> 06:10.873
We have documented
proof of a conspiracy.

06:10.972 --> 06:14.573
It-It's bigger than
the Pentagon Papers,

06:14.673 --> 06:16.172
Panama Papers, Pandora Papers.

06:16.272 --> 06:18.006
I could build
a bulletproof case on this.

06:18.106 --> 06:19.006
Anyone could.

06:19.106 --> 06:20.773
Can we just go public?

06:20.873 --> 06:22.239
Well, hardly.

06:22.407 --> 06:24.740
Right now, Crowley controls
the narrative.

06:24.840 --> 06:27.306
You know, he's got the media
blabbing nonstop

06:27.407 --> 06:29.773
about the Evers assassination
and dead judges.

06:29.873 --> 06:33.306
And he'll use fear
to turn public opinion

06:33.407 --> 06:34.940
against whatever
we throw out there.

06:35.039 --> 06:37.139
He's right. We have to control
the narrative first.

06:37.239 --> 06:38.239
Then we can reach out
to specific journalists.

06:38.407 --> 06:39.540
I've got some ideas about that.

06:39.640 --> 06:41.773
Isn't it too late?
There's a window.

06:41.873 --> 06:44.239
But it's closing. Which is why
I think, for maximum exposure,

06:44.407 --> 06:46.239
we need to move over
to the Homm Plan.

06:46.407 --> 06:49.106
Um, Homm-- Homm Plan?

06:49.206 --> 06:50.707
There's a Homm Plan?

06:50.807 --> 06:52.407
Of course, are you blind?
There's a Homm Plan.

06:52.407 --> 06:54.473
And it's pretty simple.

06:54.573 --> 06:57.407
We reveal that you're alive,
it'll go viral.

06:57.407 --> 06:58.840
At which point, the public

06:58.939 --> 07:00.840
controls the narrative.
We move in from there.

07:00.939 --> 07:02.939
The bread crumbs we've been
throwing out to Morgan Shaw

07:03.039 --> 07:05.507
will pay off in a viral moment.

07:05.607 --> 07:06.907
You're... You're Zaius?

07:07.006 --> 07:09.072
It's much easier to create
a folk hero now

07:09.172 --> 07:10.239
than it was back in the day.

07:10.407 --> 07:11.272
Hold on.

07:11.407 --> 07:14.407
"Ed Is Not Dead" is you two?

07:14.507 --> 07:15.972
I-I thought that was--

07:16.072 --> 07:17.407
Just post something on Reddit

07:17.407 --> 07:18.972
and buy likes from
a Filipino click farm,

07:19.072 --> 07:20.939
and bingo, people are in love.

07:21.039 --> 07:23.206
"Click farm."

07:24.072 --> 07:25.473
Are you serious?

07:47.039 --> 07:49.072
I don't even know.

07:49.172 --> 07:51.206
So that's...

07:51.306 --> 07:52.640
Debra.

07:52.740 --> 07:55.039
And that's...
Uh, just give me one, just...

07:55.139 --> 07:56.507
Just wait a-a minute.

07:56.607 --> 07:57.972
Uh-uh.

07:58.072 --> 07:59.507
What?

07:59.607 --> 08:02.407
You got a bizarre message
in your public account.

08:02.407 --> 08:05.306
I... thought it was
typical wingnut bullshit,

08:05.407 --> 08:06.972
but, uh, it said...

08:08.039 --> 08:09.206
Okay, first thing...

08:09.306 --> 08:11.239
Spit. Spit it out.

08:11.407 --> 08:13.906
Sorry. I...

08:15.172 --> 08:17.272
There was an attachment.

08:23.239 --> 08:24.473
She's in. Wow.

08:24.573 --> 08:26.106
Briar Park Grill, 8:00 a.m.

08:26.206 --> 08:29.707
There's only one thing that
worries me about this plan.

08:29.807 --> 08:31.407
It doesn't end
with Crowley's death.

08:31.407 --> 08:33.707
And that's the only way
to stop him.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.707
Dad. You have to trust me.

08:36.807 --> 08:38.407
I know it's not a big thing
in our family,

08:38.507 --> 08:41.172
but we don't have a choice.
This is gonna work.

08:41.272 --> 08:44.306
Hmm. Okay.

08:46.740 --> 08:48.239
"Okay"?

08:49.607 --> 08:50.939
Wow.

08:54.206 --> 08:56.707
You should get some sleep.

08:58.206 --> 08:59.972
Yeah.

09:02.006 --> 09:03.673
You, too.

09:06.906 --> 09:08.640
Weir...

09:14.407 --> 09:16.440
Um...

09:22.473 --> 09:24.440
You had me worried.

09:24.540 --> 09:27.139
I was...
I was worried about you.

09:27.239 --> 09:28.906
I know. I'm sorry.

09:29.006 --> 09:30.306
I get it.

09:30.407 --> 09:33.072
No, no, I-I don't think you do.

09:33.172 --> 09:36.906
Look, I-I wasn't trying
to be cute, okay,

09:37.006 --> 09:38.607
putting you on the bus.

09:38.707 --> 09:40.139
What we're doing right now
is dangerous

09:40.239 --> 09:42.306
and I was trying to protect you.

09:42.407 --> 09:44.106
This work, um...

09:44.206 --> 09:45.839
I'm gonna be honest, it...

09:45.939 --> 09:47.172
it's cost me everything.

09:47.272 --> 09:50.507
And I mean... everything.

09:52.906 --> 09:54.407
Like your friends?

09:54.407 --> 09:56.607
Valence?

09:57.407 --> 09:59.306
Yeah.

09:59.407 --> 10:01.373
Your wife?

10:01.473 --> 10:04.906
What... What happened with her?

10:11.507 --> 10:13.006
A job went wrong.

10:13.106 --> 10:15.573
I fucked up, she got hurt.

10:15.673 --> 10:18.039
Caught in the middle.

10:19.440 --> 10:21.573
And then she left.

10:25.540 --> 10:27.872
You still love her?

10:32.607 --> 10:36.039
Hailey, I think you know
how I feel about you.

10:36.139 --> 10:37.473
Yeah.

10:37.573 --> 10:39.407
Well, let's face it,
I'm not the most...

10:39.507 --> 10:41.239
...stable guy, so...

10:41.339 --> 10:43.039
No.

10:44.039 --> 10:47.540
I don't think I could handle
losing someone like you.

10:50.373 --> 10:52.772
I know I couldn't handle it.

11:07.139 --> 11:09.972
I went to Jo Madi.

11:10.072 --> 11:11.739
What?

11:11.839 --> 11:15.806
I... I-I was worried, I-I...

11:15.906 --> 11:18.206
You were out of your mind,
you were...

11:18.306 --> 11:23.139
I figured an arrested John Weir
was an alive John Weir.

11:24.407 --> 11:27.739
You said Jo Madi was honest.

11:27.839 --> 11:29.407
So I...

11:29.407 --> 11:31.906
I gave her some information

11:32.006 --> 11:35.272
to-to prove
what was going on and...

11:35.407 --> 11:38.972
and I-I asked her
to arrest you.

11:39.072 --> 11:42.806
To take you off the street
so that you could be safe.

12:01.272 --> 12:02.573
Okay.

12:06.906 --> 12:08.139
Okay?

12:10.407 --> 12:12.239
Yeah, okay.

12:12.407 --> 12:16.139
I mean, I... I get it.

12:16.239 --> 12:19.872
You thought you had one shot
to protect me and you took it.

12:19.972 --> 12:23.407
Okay.

12:23.507 --> 12:27.206
You did it because...

12:31.272 --> 12:33.006
Yeah.

12:33.106 --> 12:35.172
Yeah?

12:35.272 --> 12:36.939
Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:16.407 --> 13:18.172
What do you want from me?

13:18.272 --> 13:20.539
What do you want?

13:21.407 --> 13:22.440
Yes, sir.

13:22.539 --> 13:24.706
We have her. What's next?

13:26.072 --> 13:27.206
Yes.

13:28.306 --> 13:30.139
Yes, sir.

13:30.239 --> 13:31.706
What... What do you want?

13:31.806 --> 13:34.972
Tell me, I'll give it to you.

13:35.072 --> 13:36.572
What do you want?

13:36.672 --> 13:38.639
It's okay.

13:38.739 --> 13:41.172
We just need proof of life.

13:41.272 --> 13:44.407
No. No. No. No!

13:44.407 --> 13:46.639
No-- Ahh! Ahh!

13:49.772 --> 13:52.272
Morning, team. Sorry I'm late.

13:52.407 --> 13:56.106
As the lead investigator,
I thought it would be prudent

13:56.206 --> 13:58.839
to do a point-by-point review
of all the information

13:58.939 --> 14:00.706
that we've gathered to date.

14:00.806 --> 14:02.106
So, to start, I...

14:02.206 --> 14:04.206
Sorry, I have Chloe for you.

14:04.306 --> 14:05.739
Uh, hard pass.

14:05.839 --> 14:07.906
She says it's important.

14:12.539 --> 14:15.072
Un-fucking-believable.

14:19.139 --> 14:20.072
What's up, honey?

14:20.172 --> 14:21.407
<i>Hey, Mom.</i>

14:21.407 --> 14:22.872
Everything okay?
<i>No.</i>

14:22.972 --> 14:24.272
<i>Mommy went to the store
and I forgot to tell her</i>

14:24.407 --> 14:26.139
<i>I wanted Pringles.</i>

14:26.239 --> 14:27.440
Seriously?

14:27.539 --> 14:29.772
Well, why are you calling me
and not her?

14:29.872 --> 14:31.172
<i>I did, but she won't answer.</i>

14:31.272 --> 14:33.539
Well, she just left
her phone in the car.

14:33.639 --> 14:35.139
Like she always does.

14:35.239 --> 14:37.672
Guess you're just gonna have
to rough it today, Chloe.

14:37.772 --> 14:39.239
<i>But Mom...</i>

14:39.407 --> 14:41.872
Sorry, there's Mac Cheezies
on top of the fridge.

14:41.972 --> 14:44.739
And no more calls,
unless it's an emergency.

14:44.839 --> 14:47.072
Um, otherwise, text.

14:57.539 --> 14:59.972
What the hell?

15:02.172 --> 15:04.039
Hailey, you're with Ed,
you know what to do.

15:04.139 --> 15:06.472
- I'll see you at 4:00.
- Okay.

15:06.572 --> 15:08.072
As for you,

15:08.172 --> 15:10.272
I have a pickup in Yonkers.
It's important.

15:12.872 --> 15:15.407
The ex-wife you neglected
to tell me about.

15:18.839 --> 15:20.039
How'd you know about that?

15:20.139 --> 15:22.239
Oh, you lied to me.

15:22.407 --> 15:25.172
Well, not technically,
you never asked.

15:25.272 --> 15:27.306
Her name is Liv,
she's expecting you,

15:27.407 --> 15:29.572
and I know I can count
on you to keep her safe.

15:29.672 --> 15:30.906
Mm-hmm.

15:33.239 --> 15:34.472
Hey.

15:34.572 --> 15:37.406
Please try not to scare her unnecessarily.

15:38.439 --> 15:40.272
All right.

16:16.106 --> 16:18.139
Everything's a lie.

16:19.506 --> 16:22.806
Like... my marriage.

16:22.906 --> 16:25.406
My death,
even me being alive...

16:25.506 --> 16:27.439
it's all made-up.

16:27.539 --> 16:28.806
I don't know...

16:31.472 --> 16:34.039
I don't know what's real.

16:41.406 --> 16:42.706
I killed someone.

16:42.806 --> 16:43.972
What's that?

16:44.072 --> 16:46.039
I'm not stupid, you know, I...

16:46.139 --> 16:49.406
I know what I did to that
security guy at the Gao thing.

16:49.406 --> 16:51.139
I killed him.

16:51.239 --> 16:52.139
Well, um...

16:52.239 --> 16:53.972
I'm pretty sure he would've...

16:54.072 --> 16:55.972
he would've killed
if you didn't, Ed.

16:56.072 --> 16:57.739
Do you think he had a family?

16:57.839 --> 16:58.739
HAILEY [chuckling]:
What?

16:58.839 --> 17:01.306
I... I don't know.

17:01.406 --> 17:03.039
He at least had a dog,
don't you think?

17:03.139 --> 17:05.106
I-I have no idea. Listen--

17:05.206 --> 17:06.906
What if his dog has one of those

17:07.006 --> 17:08.772
hard-to-adopt personalities?

17:08.872 --> 17:11.206
You know, protective...
and nippy.

17:11.306 --> 17:12.706
Do you think they
put him down yet?

17:12.806 --> 17:14.439
S-Stop doing this.

17:19.406 --> 17:21.506
Did you notice
that black SUV has been

17:21.606 --> 17:23.806
behind us for a long time?

17:23.906 --> 17:26.106
Don't worry, Ed. It's fine.

17:26.972 --> 17:29.172
I know what I'm doing.

17:37.839 --> 17:42.039
Hi. Could I interest you
in some Girl Scout cookies?

17:42.139 --> 17:44.472
Come on in.

17:44.572 --> 17:46.406
Thank you.

17:49.072 --> 17:50.806
You're English.
I'm afraid so.

17:50.906 --> 17:52.706
Did my son never tell you?

17:52.806 --> 17:54.506
No, he didn't.

17:54.606 --> 17:56.206
Well, sounds like him.

17:58.406 --> 17:59.406
Wow.

17:59.406 --> 18:01.472
Is this...

18:01.572 --> 18:02.839
Is he my...

18:02.939 --> 18:05.172
This is Samuel.

18:05.271 --> 18:06.406
He's just at
a friend's house now,

18:06.406 --> 18:07.772
- but he'll be back.
- Wow.

18:07.872 --> 18:11.406
And, uh, when he's here,
we'll go.

18:11.406 --> 18:12.639
Hmm.

18:12.739 --> 18:14.206
He'll be back soon.

18:14.305 --> 18:15.939
Yeah.

18:22.406 --> 18:25.172
I didn't quite know
what to make of your email.

18:25.271 --> 18:28.572
You could've been a crank
or a kidnapper or something.

18:28.672 --> 18:29.906
Technically, I suppose I am.

18:30.006 --> 18:32.606
Yes, according to this.

18:32.706 --> 18:37.006
Look, the reason that
I'm bringing this to you...

18:37.106 --> 18:38.472
And I'll be brutally honest,

18:38.572 --> 18:40.506
most people in our society
don't trust the news

18:40.606 --> 18:42.206
unless it's feeding
the narrative

18:42.305 --> 18:43.839
they already want to hear.

18:43.939 --> 18:47.406
But somehow you have managed
to maintain your integrity.

18:47.506 --> 18:49.572
You command respect.

18:49.672 --> 18:52.206
So what are we talking about?

18:54.172 --> 18:57.271
On this thumb drive
is everything you need to know

18:57.406 --> 18:59.639
about the people responsible
for the assassination

18:59.739 --> 19:01.472
of Senator Evers.

19:01.572 --> 19:03.072
And that's just
the tip of the iceberg.

19:03.172 --> 19:04.672
This is a widespread conspiracy

19:04.772 --> 19:07.172
to take over
the United States of America.

19:07.271 --> 19:09.472
Moreover, I can bring you
a dead man

19:09.572 --> 19:11.639
that you can resurrect
on television

19:11.739 --> 19:14.606
to expose it all:
Edward Homm.

19:14.706 --> 19:16.506
I only have one condition.

19:16.606 --> 19:18.706
That this is presented
on live television.

19:18.806 --> 19:23.072
Think I have a few favors
I can call in. What else?

19:33.106 --> 19:36.606
Well, we have to get going.

19:43.072 --> 19:45.072
Uh, and one more thing...

19:46.472 --> 19:49.171
...don't make me out
to be a fool.

19:49.271 --> 19:52.171
My reputation is all I have.

19:54.406 --> 19:56.506
See you later. Yeah.

20:09.539 --> 20:12.138
Oh, you're paying?

20:12.238 --> 20:14.138
I haven't even ordered yet.

20:14.238 --> 20:15.972
After all this time, I worried

20:16.072 --> 20:18.338
that this was gonna
be anticlimactic.

20:18.439 --> 20:22.439
But honestly it feels better
than I even imagined it.

20:27.706 --> 20:28.672
I didn't kill anybody.

20:28.772 --> 20:29.939
Hmm, no?

20:30.039 --> 20:31.939
You just show up at crime scenes

20:32.039 --> 20:34.472
at the same time people die?

20:34.572 --> 20:35.672
Valence?

20:35.772 --> 20:37.271
He jumped.

20:37.372 --> 20:38.472
Your team?

20:38.572 --> 20:39.672
They were shot, murdered.

20:39.772 --> 20:42.238
Come on, you know
I wasn't there.

20:42.338 --> 20:44.006
You saw the video
from the security feed.

20:44.105 --> 20:46.472
Then how do you know
they were shot?

20:47.672 --> 20:48.972
What about Homm?

20:49.072 --> 20:51.606
There's video of him
getting into your car.

20:51.706 --> 20:54.806
What? No answer? No excuse?

20:54.906 --> 20:58.271
Murdering a government official
is a federal crime.

20:58.372 --> 21:01.105
And murdering someone who's part
of the Justice Department,

21:01.205 --> 21:04.406
- well, that's--
- Homm's not dead.

21:06.171 --> 21:08.439
Oh. Bullshit.

21:08.539 --> 21:11.472
- He's not and I can prove it.
- Stop it, Weir.

21:11.572 --> 21:13.205
This is bullshit.

21:13.305 --> 21:14.472
It's a distraction. He's just...

21:14.572 --> 21:15.706
you know, muddying
the waters or something.

21:15.806 --> 21:17.039
Just look at my phone, okay?

21:17.138 --> 21:18.472
I took a picture of him
this morning.

21:18.572 --> 21:20.439
I'm the only person who knows
where he's at.

21:20.539 --> 21:23.105
You want to talk to him,
you need to listen to me.

21:24.138 --> 21:25.271
Let's see it.

21:25.406 --> 21:26.672
Yes, sir.

21:26.772 --> 21:29.138
He stumbled
across this conspiracy

21:29.238 --> 21:31.039
during his investigation.

21:31.138 --> 21:32.506
That's why they wanted him dead.

21:32.606 --> 21:35.071
I got to him first,
I saved his fucking life.

21:35.171 --> 21:36.406
He says Homm's still alive.

21:36.406 --> 21:37.972
...crazier than normal, Weir.

21:38.071 --> 21:39.305
Yes, sir.
Oh, come on, you've seen

21:39.406 --> 21:40.706
some of the evidence,
it's undeniable.

21:40.806 --> 21:42.038
The connections.
And there's more.

21:42.138 --> 21:43.071
A ton more.
And I will give it to you.

21:43.171 --> 21:44.406
I just need a favor.

21:44.406 --> 21:46.772
No. No, this isn't
you making a deal.

21:46.872 --> 21:48.406
- This is you going down.
- O-Okay.

21:48.506 --> 21:50.539
I get it, okay, you wanted
to arrest me for a long time,

21:50.639 --> 21:51.839
congratulations, you win.

21:51.939 --> 21:53.639
Okay?

21:53.739 --> 21:54.839
But I know who you are.

21:54.939 --> 21:56.071
I know that you're a good cop.

21:56.171 --> 21:57.506
I know that you're honest

21:57.606 --> 21:59.305
and I know that you're not
involved in this--

21:59.406 --> 22:00.806
Yeah, yeah, this isn't the first
time that we've danced, okay?

22:00.906 --> 22:02.271
I know where this goes.

22:02.406 --> 22:04.772
You'll lead me to
some bullshit empty house

22:04.872 --> 22:07.105
and then you'll take
that opportunity to escape.

22:07.205 --> 22:11.171
Goddammit! I am not
playing games, okay?

22:11.271 --> 22:12.939
You have me in custody.

22:13.038 --> 22:14.071
I need to make a phone call

22:14.171 --> 22:15.872
to know that my family is safe.

22:15.972 --> 22:18.739
Once I know that they're where
they're supposed to be,

22:18.839 --> 22:20.772
I'm in, I'll cooperate.

22:20.872 --> 22:22.038
No deal.

22:22.138 --> 22:24.005
- Why not?
- You.

22:25.005 --> 22:27.539
I don't trust you.

22:36.171 --> 22:37.572
Fuck.

22:42.872 --> 22:43.772
Where are we going?

22:43.872 --> 22:46.071
Hang on a minute.

22:46.171 --> 22:49.238
Got something
I want to show you.

22:51.406 --> 22:53.205
You see that up there?

22:53.305 --> 22:54.672
All those people?

22:54.772 --> 22:57.238
<i>All those people,
they believe in you.</i>

22:57.406 --> 22:59.672
Oh, my God.

22:59.772 --> 23:01.706
- Oh, my God.
- Yep.

23:05.639 --> 23:07.406
Oh, shit!

23:08.539 --> 23:10.105
Come on!

23:13.572 --> 23:16.606
Have you lost your mind?
Get in the fucking car.

23:16.706 --> 23:18.939
Shit, it's him!

23:19.038 --> 23:21.005
Turn around.

23:21.105 --> 23:22.406
- I'm real!
- You were just supposed

23:22.406 --> 23:23.572
to wave at them.
He's alive!

23:23.672 --> 23:25.706
Unbelievable.

23:25.806 --> 23:28.472
You were not supposed
to jump out of the car.

23:28.572 --> 23:31.971
- Wait, what-- This is the plan?
- This is the plan.

23:32.071 --> 23:33.171
Back off. Yeah, that's him.

23:33.271 --> 23:34.839
Zaius is never wrong.

23:34.938 --> 23:36.772
<i>He came to cheer on
the protestors.</i>

23:36.872 --> 23:38.606
CROWD [chanting]:
Ed's not dead! Ed's not dead!

23:38.706 --> 23:41.938
<i>It's all happening, people.</i>

23:42.038 --> 23:44.938
Ed's not dead! Ed's not dead!

23:45.038 --> 23:48.005
Did you see that?
That was... kind of amazing.

23:48.105 --> 23:50.071
You see? I told you, Ed.

23:50.171 --> 23:51.406
Let's go fuck 'em up.

23:51.406 --> 23:53.706
We're gonna fuck 'em up!

23:54.539 --> 23:57.171
- Yeah. We're gonna fuck 'em up.
- Okay. Yeah.

23:57.271 --> 23:58.305
We're gonna fuck 'em up.

23:58.406 --> 23:59.639
- Come on.
- Fuck 'em up.

23:59.739 --> 24:02.672
I smell bullshit on
this Weir phone call ask.

24:02.772 --> 24:04.606
If there's one thing
I know about this guy,

24:04.706 --> 24:08.171
it's whatever you think he's up
to, he's up to something else.

24:08.271 --> 24:11.005
It's probably a signal
to alert his team

24:11.105 --> 24:12.439
that he's been caught.

24:12.539 --> 24:15.472
Well, he's not lying
about this, though.

24:15.572 --> 24:17.839
What do we got to lose?

24:21.739 --> 24:23.872
Family could be useful
as leverage.

24:23.971 --> 24:25.572
Can you find out
where they live?

24:25.672 --> 24:27.439
Yeah, yeah, I can get that
out of him.

24:27.539 --> 24:29.871
I already know where they live.

24:29.971 --> 24:32.406
Uh, I've been there.

24:32.406 --> 24:34.439
Impressive, Madi.

24:35.406 --> 24:36.905
Give me the address.

24:37.005 --> 24:38.672
I'll send a team
to bring them in.

24:39.938 --> 24:41.205
Yes, sir.

24:50.406 --> 24:51.905
So now, AP classes
and test scores,

24:52.005 --> 24:53.406
they're as out of fashion as...

24:53.406 --> 24:55.606
shoulder pads.

24:55.706 --> 24:57.938
But if you ask me,
it's just exchanging one form

24:58.038 --> 24:59.238
of teenage stress for another.

24:59.406 --> 25:00.806
Yeah.

25:00.905 --> 25:02.071
Yeah, I see your point.

25:02.171 --> 25:05.005
Um, perhaps you should
call him again?

25:05.105 --> 25:06.238
I'm not worried.

25:06.406 --> 25:08.572
Well, see, I know you know

25:08.672 --> 25:12.639
the kind of, um, business
your-your former husband

25:12.739 --> 25:15.005
was engaged in,
and I don't want to alarm you,

25:15.105 --> 25:19.305
but it-it never hurts
to be a little extra cautious.

25:25.739 --> 25:27.772
Okay...

25:34.038 --> 25:35.772
Okay, let's call him.

26:09.871 --> 26:11.506
<i>Your call has been forwarded</i>

26:11.606 --> 26:13.005
<i>to an automatic
voice message system.</i>

26:13.105 --> 26:16.472
<i>At the tone,
please record your message.</i>

26:16.572 --> 26:17.739
<i>When you have
finished recording--</i>

26:18.938 --> 26:20.706
We'll take my car.

26:32.672 --> 26:35.838
I need to speak to Madi. Please.

26:59.105 --> 27:01.706
Hands up. Get out of the car.

27:10.639 --> 27:12.138
What do you want?

27:12.238 --> 27:13.406
Where's Madi?

27:13.406 --> 27:15.406
She sent me.

27:15.406 --> 27:16.771
Why? Where is she?

27:16.871 --> 27:18.406
Family shit.

27:18.406 --> 27:20.138
Her wife or daughter are
always whining about something.

27:20.238 --> 27:21.738
What do you want?

27:21.838 --> 27:24.705
Same thing, family shit.
I'd like to know mine's safe.

27:25.705 --> 27:28.238
Yeah, the chief sent a team
over to your wife's house

27:28.406 --> 27:29.406
and they're bringing them in.

27:29.506 --> 27:31.171
How's he know where she lives?

27:31.271 --> 27:32.271
Madi told him.

27:32.406 --> 27:33.606
Madi's wrong, okay?

27:33.705 --> 27:35.838
She only thinks she knows
where my wife lives.

27:35.938 --> 27:38.271
Right now, she sent your chief
on a wild goose chase.

27:38.406 --> 27:41.005
That's not where they are.

27:41.105 --> 27:42.439
Oh, yeah?

27:42.539 --> 27:45.406
So... where are they?

27:46.639 --> 27:49.472
I thought you wanted
to keep them safe.

27:49.572 --> 27:51.105
Look, I can bring them in.

27:51.205 --> 27:53.572
I can personally guarantee
their safety,

27:53.671 --> 27:56.506
you just got to give me
their address.

28:00.606 --> 28:02.406
You promise?

28:02.506 --> 28:05.071
Yeah. Yeah.

28:05.171 --> 28:07.805
Shake on it.

28:10.606 --> 28:14.439
2352 Grosvenor Avenue. Yonkers.

28:16.439 --> 28:18.572
Got it.

28:31.406 --> 28:32.539
Oh, fuck.

28:32.638 --> 28:33.905
<i>Shake on it.</i>

28:35.606 --> 28:39.771
2352 Grosvenor Avenue. Yonkers.

28:40.606 --> 28:41.971
Got it.

29:14.105 --> 29:16.205
- Fuck.
- Weir!

29:17.205 --> 29:19.439
Come on, this way.

29:19.539 --> 29:21.038
<i>You're gonna have
to rough it today, Chloe.</i>

29:21.138 --> 29:22.805
<i>But Mom... Sorry.</i>

29:22.905 --> 29:24.771
<i>There's Mac Cheezies
on top of the fridge.</i>

29:24.871 --> 29:26.771
And no more calls, unless

29:26.871 --> 29:29.705
it's an emergency.
Uh, otherwise, text.

29:36.138 --> 29:37.771
What the hell?

29:46.305 --> 29:47.605
<i>Jo Madi.</i>

29:47.705 --> 29:49.805
John Weir.

29:49.905 --> 29:51.439
<i>I'll skip right to it.</i>

29:51.539 --> 29:53.406
<i>You've seen the files,
so at this point you know</i>

29:53.406 --> 29:55.905
<i>that Morello and half the FBI
are involved in this.</i>

29:56.005 --> 29:57.105
Yes.

29:57.205 --> 29:58.605
<i>And now you realize</i>

29:58.705 --> 29:59.638
<i>that if you ignore
the information,</i>

29:59.738 --> 30:00.938
<i>you're on the wrong side of it.</i>

30:01.038 --> 30:02.406
Yes.

30:02.506 --> 30:04.105
<i>Which I'm hoping
makes it impossible</i>

30:04.205 --> 30:06.338
<i>for you</i> not <i>to take action
against them.</i>

30:06.439 --> 30:07.938
Yes.

30:08.038 --> 30:09.638
<i>Well, it appears, Agent Madi,</i>

30:09.738 --> 30:11.338
<i>that we are actually
on the same side.</i>

30:11.439 --> 30:14.871
You are correct and
I'm not fucking happy about it.

30:14.971 --> 30:17.472
<i>I bet. So...</i>

30:18.271 --> 30:21.938
So, what's the fucking
plan now, asshole?

30:23.271 --> 30:24.638
Weir.

30:24.738 --> 30:27.538
Come on, this way.

30:29.571 --> 30:32.871
What time is it?
- 4:00 on the nose, we made it.

30:32.971 --> 30:34.771
Thought the studio was uptown.

30:34.871 --> 30:36.571
It is.

30:37.705 --> 30:39.338
- Thank you.
- I'll meet you up there, Weir.

30:39.439 --> 30:41.571
Yeah. Let's go.

30:48.305 --> 30:49.805
Madi?

30:50.705 --> 30:52.705
What the hell's going on?

30:55.071 --> 30:56.638
<i>Internet media is ablaze</i>

30:56.738 --> 30:58.138
<i>with alleged
eyewitness sightings</i>

30:58.238 --> 31:00.905
<i>of Treasury Investigator
Edward Homm, previously thought</i>

31:01.005 --> 31:03.605
<i>to be kidnapped and murdered
a few weeks ago.</i>

31:03.705 --> 31:06.005
<i>Long-time new media conspiracist
Morgan Shaw</i>

31:06.105 --> 31:08.406
<i>has been following these rumors
for some time now</i>

31:08.406 --> 31:10.738
<i>and has video of someone
who appears to be Edward Homm</i>

31:10.838 --> 31:13.406
<i>at a data privacy rally
in Midtown.</i>

31:13.406 --> 31:15.005
<i>But could this possibly be true?</i>

31:15.105 --> 31:17.439
<i>Well, this journalist can
confirm that Edward Homm</i>

31:17.538 --> 31:19.005
<i>is indeed alive.</i>

31:19.105 --> 31:22.671
<i>I can also confirm
he will be here, in the studio,</i>

31:22.771 --> 31:24.571
<i>for an exclusive interview</i>

31:24.671 --> 31:25.971
<i>at top of the hour.</i>

32:28.971 --> 32:31.405
You were always naive, Ben.

32:31.505 --> 32:32.838
Oh, please.

32:32.938 --> 32:34.738
Just put a bullet in my head.

32:34.838 --> 32:36.638
You've won.

32:36.738 --> 32:39.138
Dying a hero's death.

32:40.538 --> 32:42.771
To save what?

32:42.871 --> 32:47.271
This pathetic mess
you call a country?

32:48.271 --> 32:50.271
You know how fucked up it is.

32:51.138 --> 32:52.571
We took a wrong turn.

32:52.671 --> 32:55.905
A long, long time ago.

32:56.005 --> 32:58.505
And now I'm in a position...

32:58.605 --> 33:00.038
to fix it.

33:00.138 --> 33:03.738
People need to have
their decisions made for them.

33:03.838 --> 33:07.038
And you know it.
It's the only way...

33:07.138 --> 33:09.738
to restore some fucking balance.

33:09.838 --> 33:11.305
Balance?

33:11.405 --> 33:13.605
You think
I don't know what you're saying

33:13.705 --> 33:15.405
when you talk about "balance"?

33:16.405 --> 33:18.405
Of course I do.

33:19.171 --> 33:22.205
It's time to bring
the dogs to heel.

33:22.305 --> 33:26.905
This country is not yours
to take.

33:27.005 --> 33:29.971
I already took it.

33:48.738 --> 33:50.471
What was that?

33:50.571 --> 33:52.405
What? What's going on?

33:52.405 --> 33:54.005
The door.

34:10.105 --> 34:12.405
What's going on? Hello?!

34:13.738 --> 34:15.271
Fuck! Who are you?!

34:15.405 --> 34:17.271
- It's almost time. You ready?
- Hmm?

34:17.405 --> 34:19.038
Yeah, yeah.

34:19.138 --> 34:21.805
Well, a little nervous.
Sweating a little, too.

34:21.905 --> 34:23.738
But it's...

34:25.005 --> 34:27.571
Hey. You're gonna be great.

34:27.671 --> 34:28.838
Yeah.

34:28.938 --> 34:30.238
Oh, my God, Ed, you got to see

34:30.405 --> 34:31.805
these amazing suits
they pulled for you.

34:33.771 --> 34:35.270
You guys need to see something.

34:37.138 --> 34:38.871
What?

34:46.405 --> 34:47.671
DOJ.

34:47.771 --> 34:48.771
Supposedly they have
an injunction

34:48.871 --> 34:51.105
to stop the broadcast.

34:52.171 --> 34:55.005
I sent a team from Legal
to verify.

34:55.971 --> 34:57.071
Bullshit. It's not real.

34:57.171 --> 34:58.505
How do you know that?

34:58.605 --> 34:59.738
Because there's no way
they could get a judge

34:59.838 --> 35:01.405
to sign off on it that fast.

35:01.405 --> 35:03.138
Well, most of our security team
is down there,

35:03.237 --> 35:05.138
so they won't get by.

35:07.671 --> 35:09.071
Maybe that's the point.

35:09.171 --> 35:11.405
It's a distraction.

35:11.405 --> 35:12.471
It's all in order.

35:12.571 --> 35:13.905
You have five minutes to comply.

35:14.005 --> 35:16.205
Five minutes?
Where'd you come up with that?

35:16.304 --> 35:18.638
I think we have the right
to review this more properly.

35:18.738 --> 35:20.138
Why don't you take a seat?

35:20.237 --> 35:22.638
No. Everything's in order.

35:22.738 --> 35:23.971
- Is it?
- You see the stamp.

35:24.071 --> 35:25.205
Is this even stamped properly?

35:25.304 --> 35:26.505
It's stamped.

35:26.605 --> 35:28.270
Five minutes is ridiculous.

35:28.405 --> 35:30.605
We will review these documents
in a timely fashion...

35:49.871 --> 35:52.237
Come on.

35:56.505 --> 35:57.638
Oh, shit.

35:57.738 --> 36:00.471
Lock him up
till the cops get here.

36:01.270 --> 36:03.838
Nothing personal, boss.

36:03.938 --> 36:06.538
It was just a job, okay?
I just did it for the money.

36:06.638 --> 36:09.071
Shouldn't take it
so personally, you know?

36:09.838 --> 36:12.971
- We want upstairs access now.
- That's not gonna happen.

36:13.071 --> 36:14.438
Forget it. Let's go.

36:14.538 --> 36:15.938
Hey, where the hell
do you think you're going?

36:16.038 --> 36:17.204
I'm sorry,
but we can't let you pass.

36:17.304 --> 36:18.505
Yeah? Did you read
the injunction?

36:18.605 --> 36:20.105
- I have read the injunction--
- Yeah.

36:20.204 --> 36:21.571
- And it's stamped by a judge.
- I'm sorry,

36:21.671 --> 36:22.705
- what lawyers are you?
- Department of Justice.

36:24.237 --> 36:25.905
- Don't touch me.
- We just need a little time.

36:28.771 --> 36:30.738
FBI! FBI!
FBI, you're under arrest!

36:30.838 --> 36:33.771
Hands on your head!
Put your hands on your head!

36:33.871 --> 36:35.438
Hands, hands! Let's see 'em!

36:35.538 --> 36:37.005
Turn around!

36:38.038 --> 36:40.638
These people are not DOJ.

36:40.738 --> 36:42.137
On the ground!

36:42.237 --> 36:44.905
Jesus, Madi,
I hope you're right.

36:45.005 --> 36:48.471
He's going down, Rasche.
You'll see.

36:49.405 --> 36:51.705
That his?

36:51.805 --> 36:54.105
Let's see what we got.

37:13.170 --> 37:14.671
Lock this up.

37:23.838 --> 37:25.838
<i>Prepare inputs.</i>

37:25.938 --> 37:27.104
<i>Copy that.</i>

37:27.204 --> 37:29.204
- Link to databases.
<i>- Linking.</i>

37:32.538 --> 37:35.438
Index.
<i>Indexing.</i>

37:58.070 --> 37:59.505
Hello?

38:00.638 --> 38:02.237
Yes.

38:04.405 --> 38:05.771
What?

38:05.871 --> 38:07.638
Herpes.

38:07.738 --> 38:08.938
Porn history

38:09.038 --> 38:10.871
and statutory arrest
for soliciting.

38:15.938 --> 38:17.204
But the one I see here,

38:17.304 --> 38:19.204
where your father,
the district judge,

38:19.304 --> 38:22.037
managed to sweep it all
under the rug...

38:30.304 --> 38:33.137
Soliciting a minor? Very nasty.

38:33.237 --> 38:36.005
Why would you
take so many pictures?

38:38.705 --> 38:40.538
Does your wife know?

38:40.638 --> 38:43.104
I mean Jennifer.

38:43.204 --> 38:45.005
Does Jennifer know?

38:55.738 --> 38:58.037
I understand.

39:10.137 --> 39:11.037
Five minutes.

39:11.137 --> 39:12.805
Let's get you to set.

39:12.905 --> 39:14.638
Okay, thanks.

39:14.738 --> 39:17.438
You are ready.

39:19.304 --> 39:21.304
They're here.

39:23.805 --> 39:25.871
Jess, your wife's on nine,
says it's urgent.

39:25.971 --> 39:27.505
Okay.

39:27.605 --> 39:29.605
- Go get 'em, buddy.
- Thank you.

39:39.538 --> 39:41.304
Hey.

39:46.405 --> 39:48.471
Okay, Ed, all you have to do
is follow my lead.

39:48.571 --> 39:50.438
We've already got
the, uh, frame stores

39:50.538 --> 39:52.438
of the leaders and financials
all loaded in.

39:52.538 --> 39:55.405
I'll set everything up and
all you got to do is, um...

39:55.405 --> 39:56.571
tell me what we're looking at.

39:56.671 --> 39:57.705
You good?

39:57.805 --> 39:59.104
- I'm good. Thanks.
- Good. Okay.

39:59.204 --> 40:00.538
Got some water there.

40:00.638 --> 40:02.070
- Thanks.
- Okay.

40:02.170 --> 40:05.004
- He's gonna be fine.
- Yep.

40:05.104 --> 40:07.104
One minute.

40:07.204 --> 40:09.170
Who is this?

40:10.204 --> 40:11.771
How do you know that?

40:11.871 --> 40:13.738
How could you know that?

40:15.805 --> 40:17.605
Please don't.

40:18.571 --> 40:20.337
I'll do whatever you want.

40:20.438 --> 40:22.204
Let's put up
the graphics package.

40:23.004 --> 40:25.771
Prepare to cut in. 30 seconds.

40:25.871 --> 40:27.104
No, wait.

40:27.204 --> 40:28.438
Don't cut in.

40:29.538 --> 40:30.405
Holding.

40:30.505 --> 40:32.671
Why, what? What's happening?

40:32.771 --> 40:34.137
Why are we stopping?

40:34.237 --> 40:36.771
I'll be right back.

40:36.871 --> 40:39.037
Jess? Why are we stopping?

40:39.137 --> 40:40.170
What's going on?

40:40.270 --> 40:42.671
He wants to talk to you.

40:48.871 --> 40:52.538
<i>I have your father
and I have your wife.</i>

40:52.638 --> 40:54.037
Say hello, Ben.

40:54.137 --> 40:55.638
Fuck you.

40:55.738 --> 40:59.937
Any deviation from
what I tell you to do,

41:00.037 --> 41:01.605
I'll kill them.

41:01.705 --> 41:04.304
<i>There will be
no broadcast, of course.</i>

41:04.405 --> 41:06.605
<i>Understood?</i>

41:06.705 --> 41:07.904
Understood.

41:08.004 --> 41:09.237
<i>Good.</i>

41:12.505 --> 41:14.070
My father used to try
and tell me

41:14.170 --> 41:15.805
that the people you cared
about the most

41:15.904 --> 41:17.870
would be your greatest weakness.

41:19.805 --> 41:22.937
If someone was coming after you,
they'd be the way in.

41:23.037 --> 41:24.904
<i>You should've
listened to your father.</i>

41:25.004 --> 41:27.170
Oh, that's not the first time
I've heard that.

41:29.170 --> 41:30.471
<i>Well, now you've got him.</i>

41:30.571 --> 41:33.170
<i>There's nothing
I can do about it.</i>

41:35.904 --> 41:39.170
You've been waiting for this
for a long time.

41:44.405 --> 41:47.538
And I'm in no position to beg.

41:47.638 --> 41:49.538
Or ask.

41:49.638 --> 41:51.270
But I would be really grateful

41:51.405 --> 41:54.137
if you would consider
letting my ex-wife go.

42:00.137 --> 42:02.870
She's not a part of this.

42:04.438 --> 42:06.538
I'm not letting her go.

42:06.638 --> 42:09.270
<i>She obviously still means
something to you</i>

42:09.405 --> 42:10.771
<i>and that's the point.</i>

42:12.605 --> 42:15.471
She doesn't know anything.

42:18.070 --> 42:20.671
What is your play here?

42:20.771 --> 42:22.037
Wasting time?

42:22.137 --> 42:23.837
For what, exactly?

42:23.937 --> 42:25.237
It's over.

42:25.405 --> 42:27.438
My wife left me because
she was kidnapped.

42:27.538 --> 42:29.771
<i>By one of my competitors.</i>

42:29.870 --> 42:31.137
They threatened to kill her
if I didn't do

42:31.237 --> 42:32.505
everything that they asked.

42:32.605 --> 42:34.438
They even sent me
part of her finger,

42:34.538 --> 42:35.937
<i>to make their point.</i>

42:36.037 --> 42:38.937
What the fuck is he saying?
What's he on about?

42:39.037 --> 42:41.270
So I had to hire a pro

42:41.405 --> 42:44.671
<i>to get her back, a real badass.</i>

42:44.771 --> 42:46.405
And it worked. I got her back.

42:46.405 --> 42:48.405
But she never talked
to me again.

42:48.405 --> 42:50.405
None of this matters.

42:50.405 --> 42:53.405
You may be right about that.

42:54.405 --> 42:57.137
You see, 'cause the woman
that you've got...

42:57.237 --> 42:59.904
isn't my ex-wife.

43:03.837 --> 43:06.070
She's the person I sent in
to get her.

43:06.170 --> 43:08.104
Fuck! Who are you?!

43:08.204 --> 43:10.004
<i>The badass.</i>

43:10.104 --> 43:11.304
Your husband sent me.

43:11.405 --> 43:12.638
Let's go.

43:12.738 --> 43:15.405
So good luck with that, motherfucker.

43:36.705 --> 43:38.804
No. No, no. No, no, no, no...

43:44.405 --> 43:46.904
Clear!

43:50.837 --> 43:54.104
What the blue, bloody fuck
was that?

43:54.204 --> 43:55.671
Yeah, sorry about that.

43:55.770 --> 43:57.304
<i>I suppose
you kept me in the dark</i>

43:57.405 --> 43:59.270
<i>because you felt up till now</i>

43:59.405 --> 44:00.970
you couldn't trust me, yes?

44:01.070 --> 44:02.937
<i>No, I was playing
the narrative to the bitter end,</i>

44:03.037 --> 44:04.904
<i>just like you taught me.</i>

44:05.004 --> 44:07.405
God...

44:10.538 --> 44:12.405
<i>Besides, you've got him now.</i>

44:12.405 --> 44:14.770
He's all yours.

44:22.538 --> 44:25.671
John, that's the nicest thing...

44:25.770 --> 44:28.538
anyone's ever done for me.

44:28.638 --> 44:30.670
<i>Well, that's kind of sad, Dad.</i>

44:30.770 --> 44:33.004
<i>But you're welcome.</i>

44:44.405 --> 44:45.970
Oh, fuck.

44:49.904 --> 44:52.538
Do you know I've spent
the best part of my life...

44:52.638 --> 44:54.104
watching you?

44:54.204 --> 44:57.237
<i>Chasing you.</i>

44:57.405 --> 44:59.571
<i>Hiding from you.</i>

44:59.670 --> 45:02.004
I sacrificed my family.

45:02.104 --> 45:03.505
My wife, my son.

45:03.605 --> 45:05.505
A lot of the time, my sanity.

45:08.304 --> 45:11.204
I wanted there to be some
wonderful conclusion, you know?

45:12.405 --> 45:14.870
The mother of all confrontations.

45:15.770 --> 45:19.837
But fuck it,
you can't even stand up.

45:21.538 --> 45:23.004
<i>Tell me something.</i>

45:24.304 --> 45:26.037
<i>Did you, at any time,</i>

45:26.137 --> 45:29.970
have a nagging doubt
that you might have been wrong?

45:33.204 --> 45:35.170
No, of course not.

45:36.670 --> 45:38.870
So, what's wrong with you, hmm?

45:40.237 --> 45:41.604
How ill are you?

45:45.870 --> 45:48.571
<i>Maybe I should just let you die.</i>

45:53.438 --> 45:56.170
The only doubt...

45:56.270 --> 45:57.970
<i>that I ever had...</i>

46:00.405 --> 46:02.538
was about you.

46:15.304 --> 46:17.505
Weir!

46:23.471 --> 46:26.405
- Weir?
- Don't worry about him now.

46:26.405 --> 46:28.770
Let's get this going.

46:28.870 --> 46:30.704
Come on.
And we're in.

46:30.804 --> 46:34.570
In five, four, three...

46:40.070 --> 46:42.170
Many times in our
nation's history,

46:42.270 --> 46:44.637
we have heard pundits
and politicians

46:44.737 --> 46:45.937
speak of vast conspiracies

46:46.037 --> 46:47.837
to undermine the will
of the people

46:47.937 --> 46:49.737
and rule from the shadows.

46:49.837 --> 46:51.904
Very few, if any,
of these tales has ever

46:52.004 --> 46:55.170
had evidence
to back such claims.

46:55.270 --> 46:58.537
Until now. Until tonight.

46:58.637 --> 47:02.037
Joining me is Treasury
Investigator Edward Homm,

47:02.137 --> 47:04.804
who, until recently,
was officially deceased.

47:04.904 --> 47:07.770
But now sits in front of us
alive and well

47:07.870 --> 47:11.304
with an incredible story
to tell.

47:12.471 --> 47:13.870
Go ahead.

47:14.937 --> 47:15.937
Uh...

47:23.870 --> 47:27.770
Our team has accumulated
enough evidence to bring

47:27.870 --> 47:31.204
thousands of indictments
and arrests against...

47:31.304 --> 47:34.204
the richest and most powerful
people in this country,

47:34.304 --> 47:37.405
many... recognizable.

47:37.405 --> 47:40.604
A far-reaching conspiracy

47:40.704 --> 47:42.570
to control our lives
while maintaining

47:42.670 --> 47:45.604
the illusion of democracy.

47:46.604 --> 47:49.405
But this about more than that.

47:49.504 --> 47:50.604
This is about trust.

47:50.704 --> 47:53.304
<i>We-we place a lot of trust</i>

47:53.405 --> 47:56.405
in institutions and politicians,

47:56.405 --> 48:00.837
<i>businesses or even a spouse.</i>

48:03.604 --> 48:04.804
A family.

48:04.904 --> 48:07.637
Without thinking about
whether or not

48:07.737 --> 48:09.804
<i>they have really earned it.</i>

48:09.904 --> 48:13.405
<i>We log into social media sites,</i>

48:13.405 --> 48:15.070
<i>shop online, run our genealogy,</i>

48:15.170 --> 48:17.837
<i>vote for politicians...
You surrender...</i>

48:17.937 --> 48:21.405
your information,
pieces of yourself, to them.

48:21.405 --> 48:23.670
You are trusting them.

48:24.604 --> 48:27.604
<i>Bunch of boring ones and zeroes.
Just data.</i>

48:27.704 --> 48:29.737
But data that,
in the wrong hands,

48:29.837 --> 48:31.470
can be used against you.

48:31.570 --> 48:34.405
<i>We've-we've all known
this is possible.</i>

48:34.504 --> 48:37.270
<i>Right? Somewhere in our minds,
we've always...</i>

48:37.405 --> 48:39.704
<i>known, but, uh...</i>

48:39.804 --> 48:42.870
But still, we do it.

48:44.405 --> 48:46.904
Because we don't really
have a choice.

48:47.004 --> 48:48.737
But now we have evidence

48:48.837 --> 48:53.037
that proves that these powerful
people and corporations use us.

48:54.604 --> 48:56.237
Manipulate us.

48:56.404 --> 48:59.104
And have long ago
compromised our trust.

49:01.104 --> 49:04.104
It's time for them to pay.

49:06.470 --> 49:09.170
<i>Ed is not dead.</i>

49:28.004 --> 49:29.404
Weir.

49:31.237 --> 49:32.437
Agent Madi.

49:32.537 --> 49:34.437
Just so you know:
I have enough evidence

49:34.537 --> 49:36.770
to put you away for
that Esper Ethicka job

49:36.870 --> 49:38.737
you pulled at the steakhouse.

49:38.837 --> 49:39.937
I'm sure you think you do.

49:40.037 --> 49:42.137
Am I under arrest?

49:43.737 --> 49:45.070
Not today.

49:45.170 --> 49:47.304
I have to spend some time
with my family.

49:47.404 --> 49:48.670
God help me.

49:49.504 --> 49:51.004
Tomorrow, then.

49:57.104 --> 49:59.104
Tomorrow.

50:05.604 --> 50:06.870
What the fuck was that?

50:06.970 --> 50:08.670
What was what?

50:08.770 --> 50:10.904
The look that Madi
just gave you.

50:11.004 --> 50:12.937
What are you talking about?

50:13.037 --> 50:14.604
Hailey, I still know
when you're lying.

50:14.704 --> 50:16.304
I'm not lying.

50:17.437 --> 50:18.970
I'm evading.

50:19.070 --> 50:21.336
Okay, fine, when I met
with Madi, I...

50:21.437 --> 50:22.570
I made a deal.

50:22.670 --> 50:23.904
I saw an opening

50:24.004 --> 50:26.837
to get closure with my old boss.

50:26.937 --> 50:28.804
Oh, my God.

50:28.904 --> 50:30.737
You had her arrest him
instead of me.

50:30.837 --> 50:32.137
He's a dirtbag.

50:32.237 --> 50:33.604
And what about the money
you stole?

50:33.704 --> 50:36.937
As far as the FBI
is concerned...

50:37.037 --> 50:39.670
there was no money.

50:39.770 --> 50:41.237
Wow.

50:41.336 --> 50:44.270
You're not...
mad about that, are you?

50:44.370 --> 50:45.937
Nope. Not mad.

50:46.037 --> 50:48.504
Just did not see that coming.

50:48.604 --> 50:50.303
Okay, and...?

50:50.404 --> 50:52.770
I'm a little nervous.

50:52.870 --> 50:55.437
You're getting really
fucking good at this.

50:59.370 --> 51:00.670
I'm a work in progress.

51:00.770 --> 51:03.504
Yes, you are.

51:21.070 --> 51:23.037
And I suppose I don't...

51:23.137 --> 51:25.570
I don't have a grandson, then?

51:25.670 --> 51:27.137
No, Sam's mine.

51:27.237 --> 51:28.637
He's been with his grandparents

51:28.737 --> 51:30.037
- since things heated up.
- Ah.

51:32.604 --> 51:34.303
Hmm.

52:02.904 --> 52:04.937
Who is this?
