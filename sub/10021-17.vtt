00:07.120 --> 00:08.109
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

00:08.321 --> 00:10.551
- What happened?
- Her husband called 911...

00:10.757 --> 00:12.452
...but wouldn't let us in.

00:12.859 --> 00:16.920
All this time I'm worrying about HIV
and I get hepatitis C?

00:17.130 --> 00:18.597
My wife, is she dead?

00:18.798 --> 00:20.925
- Can you get Mark?
- Sure, I can do that.

00:21.134 --> 00:21.964
And Security.

00:22.168 --> 00:23.294
I'm gonna resign.

00:23.903 --> 00:25.063
Do you want him to go?

00:25.538 --> 00:27.563
I love him like a brother.

00:28.241 --> 00:30.209
But I can't do this anymore.
Too hard.

00:30.610 --> 00:33.704
I can't remember a time
when I didn't love him.

00:33.913 --> 00:35.471
Not coming with me, are you?

01:14.554 --> 01:17.148
- You gotta love the night shift.
- No, you don't.

01:17.357 --> 01:19.518
- How's the ride-along?
- It has been wild.

01:19.726 --> 01:23.025
Two old guys swimming naked in
the lake nearly froze their...

01:23.229 --> 01:25.823
- Carter, we get it.
- Now we got this crazy lady.

01:26.032 --> 01:28.330
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Grab your coat.

01:31.638 --> 01:34.004
Tried to eat the lovebirds
at the Delaware.

01:34.207 --> 01:37.506
- You were right. She's crazy.
- Really psychotic.

01:37.810 --> 01:40.745
She's combative.
She locked herself in.

01:40.947 --> 01:45.680
We'll try Haldol before we call for
the bolt cutters. One, two, three...

01:46.552 --> 01:48.349
Does she think she's a hawk or...?

01:48.655 --> 01:50.953
Hawks attack with claws,
not their teeth.

01:51.157 --> 01:52.988
- Why is she staring?
- She likes you.

01:53.192 --> 01:55.660
No, your gaze is threatening her.
Look away!

01:55.862 --> 01:57.727
I'll look away, fine.

01:57.931 --> 02:00.593
<i>You're looking at it now</i>
<i>on Nicole's lovely wrist.</i>

02:00.800 --> 02:03.394
<i>It's a winner. It's a knockout.</i>
<i>It really is.</i>

02:03.603 --> 02:07.039
<i>It's memorable. It's a bracelet</i>
<i>you'll want to wear every day.</i>

02:07.240 --> 02:09.731
<i>It's bold and beautiful.</i>
<i>You know what else?</i>

02:09.943 --> 02:12.969
<i>It's reversible.</i>
<i>Flip it over for me, Nicole.</i>

02:13.179 --> 02:15.647
<i>Watch the other side. It's gorgeous.</i>

02:26.526 --> 02:29.586
- Why should I wait for Jerry?
- He likes this stuff.

02:29.796 --> 02:32.094
- What stuff?
- These strange dudes.

02:32.298 --> 02:34.664
They're called "patients."
I'm not waiting.

02:34.867 --> 02:37.700
Mr. IKornberg? Hi, I'm Dr. Weaver.

02:37.904 --> 02:40.168
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise. Here you go.

02:40.373 --> 02:43.467
- He twisted his knee wrestling.
- At 3 in the morning?

02:43.676 --> 02:45.143
No, last night's match.

02:45.345 --> 02:47.540
It wasn't so bad until
I got up to pee.

02:47.747 --> 02:49.408
Okay, let's take a look.

02:49.615 --> 02:52.516
- A flying drop kick?
- Jackknife power bomb.

02:52.719 --> 02:55.984
- I thought you guys didn't get hurt.
- What do you mean?

02:56.522 --> 02:58.922
Come on. Everybody knows
wrestling's fake.

02:59.125 --> 03:01.252
- Who are you calling fake?
- That's enough.

03:01.461 --> 03:03.326
You, man. It's all rehearsed.

03:03.529 --> 03:05.554
You and your boys are
a bunch of fakes.

03:05.765 --> 03:06.857
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

03:07.066 --> 03:09.159
- I'll show you fake.
- Hey, man!

03:09.369 --> 03:11.428
- Hey! Stop it!
- Hey!

03:13.740 --> 03:16.937
Mr. IKornberg, I said put
him down right now!

03:18.811 --> 03:21.245
Call Security! I need some help here!

03:21.447 --> 03:23.176
Malik, are you all right?

03:24.350 --> 03:26.511
We got you good, didn't we?
Oh, man.

03:26.986 --> 03:29.420
I wish Jerry could've seen this.

03:31.991 --> 03:32.923
Sorry.

03:33.126 --> 03:34.491
He wanted to do that.

03:36.529 --> 03:37.757
Sit down.

04:28.948 --> 04:31.109
- What happened to her son?
- They just left.

04:31.317 --> 04:33.547
- They said they'd be back.
- Great timing.

04:33.753 --> 04:36.051
Mrs. Fong, don't worry.
You're fine.

04:36.255 --> 04:37.916
We're taking you to your room.

04:38.124 --> 04:41.025
- Is everything all right?
- Yes, everything's fine.

04:43.796 --> 04:47.288
Did my mother have another seizure?
She doesn't remember we left.

04:47.500 --> 04:50.128
She's fine. She just got back
from her head CT.

04:50.336 --> 04:55.137
It's best if you stay close. It's
difficult to find an interpreter.

04:55.341 --> 04:56.603
We had to get <i>Pao Chi.</i>

04:56.809 --> 04:58.640
- The what?
- To settle her stomach.

04:58.845 --> 05:02.281
- She shouldn't take that now.
- Herbs will make her feel better.

05:02.682 --> 05:05.082
If you don't mind, I'd rather wait...

05:05.284 --> 05:07.946
...for the test results
before giving her anything.

05:09.422 --> 05:11.549
- How's she doing?
- Haldol's kicked in...

05:11.757 --> 05:15.193
...and Maintenance will cut the cage.
Psych should be down soon.

05:15.428 --> 05:17.589
- Yo, John! Gotta go!
- Okay!

05:17.797 --> 05:19.662
- Sorry to dump her.
- It's our job.

05:19.866 --> 05:23.029
- Are you stealing those supplies?
- Of course not.

05:23.236 --> 05:25.568
Thank you. I didn't think so.
Malik.

05:25.771 --> 05:27.500
- Ah, Dr. Weaver.
- Yeah.

05:27.707 --> 05:30.676
- About Mr. IKornberg.
- I asked him. He could've said no.

05:30.877 --> 05:33.505
You want a patient with
a bad knee to do tricks?

05:33.713 --> 05:36.181
That's what they do.
He's a major contender.

05:36.382 --> 05:38.612
- He's the man!
- Okay, let's break it up.

05:38.818 --> 05:40.877
- One more for my mom?
- Here we go!

05:41.087 --> 05:42.213
Jerry!

05:43.189 --> 05:46.317
- Okay. That's it for now.
- No, that's it, period.

05:46.526 --> 05:48.960
Looking good, man!
Ready to take on Hybrid?

05:49.162 --> 05:50.026
- Yeah.
- Malik.

05:50.229 --> 05:52.527
I can handle this on my own.
Thank you.

05:52.732 --> 05:53.630
Sure.

05:55.368 --> 06:00.169
- I'm sorry about all this attention.
- It's okay. I'm used to it.

06:00.373 --> 06:04.776
You have bleeding inside the knee.
I'm gonna numb it and tap the joint.

06:04.977 --> 06:08.344
- Should decrease some of the pain.
- I've had that done before.

06:08.548 --> 06:10.175
This isn't your first injury?

06:10.383 --> 06:14.319
- You name it, I broke it.
- Sounds like a rough sport.

06:14.520 --> 06:18.820
Living on the road most of the year
and getting mauled by 40,000 fans...

06:19.025 --> 06:21.619
...that's rough.
- I've surfed by on cable.

06:21.827 --> 06:24.261
It seems like a profession
for showoffs.

06:24.564 --> 06:28.466
- You don't like the celebrity, huh?
- Just give them what they want.

06:28.901 --> 06:32.462
- What would you rather do?
- You'd laugh if I told you.

06:32.672 --> 06:34.970
I will try not to.

06:35.341 --> 06:39.277
Live in Montana. Lots of land.
Peace and quiet.

06:39.478 --> 06:43.039
- Really? You'd raise cattle?
- I'd like to have a farm.

06:43.249 --> 06:45.513
- Grow sugar beets.
- Really?

06:45.718 --> 06:47.549
- Go ahead and laugh.
- I'm not.

06:47.753 --> 06:48.981
It's okay. I do.

06:50.056 --> 06:51.284
Okay.

06:52.458 --> 06:55.222
- Now, does that feel better?
- Oh, yeah.

06:55.428 --> 06:56.258
Good.

06:56.462 --> 06:59.397
- You gonna wake Maloney?
- No, he only gets up for admissions...

06:59.599 --> 07:02.397
...and code blues.
- Want me to talk to them?

07:03.502 --> 07:05.129
No. I can do it.

07:10.009 --> 07:11.271
And if she does?

07:11.944 --> 07:14.936
Mr. And Mrs. Fong,
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

07:15.147 --> 07:17.411
- Emily, go inside and keep...
- In a minute.

07:17.617 --> 07:19.642
- It would be better if...
- It's okay, Dad.

07:21.320 --> 07:22.309
Yes, Miss IKnight?

07:23.522 --> 07:27.618
Your mother has a tumor in her lung
which has spread to her brain.

07:28.628 --> 07:31.756
That's what caused the seizures.
It's advanced cancer.

07:31.964 --> 07:33.226
Oh, my God!

07:33.432 --> 07:35.400
I know this is difficult to take in.

07:36.369 --> 07:39.736
- We've known about it for a year.
- Why didn't you tell me?

07:39.939 --> 07:42.271
- You were away at school.
- You couldn't call?

07:42.475 --> 07:44.807
Maybe if you take some time
to discuss...

07:45.011 --> 07:47.946
- We didn't want to upset you.
- Not knowing is worse.

07:48.147 --> 07:50.172
I'll come back and review
the results...

07:50.383 --> 07:53.580
...with your mother, okay?
- That won't be necessary.

07:55.855 --> 07:58.688
- My mother doesn't know.
- You haven't told her?

07:58.891 --> 08:00.449
We're not going to tell her.

08:00.660 --> 08:03.356
She should be getting treatment
from an oncologist.

08:03.562 --> 08:06.326
I don't understand why
you're doing this.

08:06.699 --> 08:09.634
- It'll only depress her.
- She'll die sooner for knowing.

08:09.835 --> 08:12.827
Radiation therapy can help her
life and stop seizures.

08:13.039 --> 08:14.666
But she has to be informed.

08:14.874 --> 08:17.638
We're not telling her,
and we don't want you to.

08:18.077 --> 08:20.773
You're right, Miss IKnight.
You do not understand.

08:40.799 --> 08:42.768
Can't talk to them
when they're like this.

08:42.967 --> 08:44.868
- Like what?
- Traditional.

08:45.071 --> 08:46.971
I guess that's the polite word.

08:48.574 --> 08:50.508
What's her prognosis?

08:51.243 --> 08:52.801
It's a stage-four cancer.

08:55.081 --> 08:56.810
What does that mean?

08:57.616 --> 09:00.084
She probably has a few months.

09:00.986 --> 09:04.387
I wish they'd told me.
I could've spent more time with her.

09:05.157 --> 09:06.749
You mentioned treatment?

09:06.959 --> 09:11.191
Radiation, maybe chemo. But we
can't treat her if we can't tell her.

09:11.397 --> 09:14.366
We think she'll lose
her will to live.

09:15.768 --> 09:17.565
And what do you think?

09:19.338 --> 09:22.239
- You think she'd want to know?
- She's a tough lady.

09:22.441 --> 09:24.636
She'd want to fight this.

09:28.147 --> 09:31.275
- What do you got?
- Mr. IKingsley, vomiting since 2 a.m.

09:31.484 --> 09:34.749
I ate the steak tartare at Fletcher's.
Never again.

09:34.954 --> 09:37.184
- A steak what?
- Raw beef, raw egg yolk.

09:37.957 --> 09:40.357
Five of Compazine, liter of saline.

09:40.559 --> 09:42.754
- Is that who I think it is?
- You know IKornberg?

09:42.962 --> 09:45.658
IKnow him? He's the best since
Freddie Blassie.

09:45.865 --> 09:46.729
Freddie who?

09:47.099 --> 09:50.091
Used to bite the hell out of
his opponents' foreheads!

09:50.302 --> 09:53.465
In the '60s. Oh, you're too young.

09:53.839 --> 09:54.669
Jerry?

09:54.874 --> 09:58.173
I thought I told you to leave
Mr. IKornberg alone.

09:58.377 --> 09:59.867
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.

10:00.079 --> 10:02.604
- I'm taking him to Radiology.
- And Transport?

10:02.815 --> 10:05.545
They were backed up.
I thought I'd help out.

10:06.285 --> 10:08.651
Remember that pay-per-view
when Jericho...

10:08.854 --> 10:11.345
...hit your shoulder
and you went down for two?

10:11.557 --> 10:14.822
But you came back with that
jackhammer side slam, right?

10:15.027 --> 10:15.959
That's right.

10:16.162 --> 10:18.392
- IKornberg's the bomb!
- Jerry!

10:20.599 --> 10:24.126
Why not wrestle tag team?
You and Stinger would be unbeatable.

10:24.336 --> 10:26.770
He's got that corner drop
that's like...

10:31.610 --> 10:34.738
I called the floor.
A bed will be ready at 7.

10:43.456 --> 10:47.415
Mrs. Fong, who do you want to make
decisions about your health?

10:54.033 --> 10:57.264
She says to talk to my father.
Maybe we shouldn't do this.

10:57.470 --> 11:01.770
For any news about your condition,
who do you want us to talk to?

11:09.882 --> 11:14.444
She says a year ago my father
told her she had tuberculosis.

11:14.653 --> 11:16.883
They told her that instead of cancer.

11:17.890 --> 11:19.585
Cancer?

11:19.792 --> 11:24.024
Repeat! Unit 47 requesting police
backup, 3800 block of Drexel.

11:24.230 --> 11:25.322
Sons of bitches!

11:25.531 --> 11:28.295
- Threatened to burn my building!
- Sit, Mr. Leonelli.

11:28.501 --> 11:30.059
We still might, to keep warm!

11:30.503 --> 11:32.562
- Have a seat.
- Why not call the cops?

11:32.771 --> 11:35.467
Because, they'd haul his ass to jail!

11:35.674 --> 11:38.541
- Landlords can get away with it!
- Shut up, Felonia!

11:38.744 --> 11:40.905
- Pay your rent!
- Take the other side.

11:41.113 --> 11:42.603
You can't turn the heat off!

11:42.815 --> 11:45.409
- My grandmother's freezing!
- Get a job, dumb-ass!

11:45.618 --> 11:47.552
- You're the dumb-ass!
- Back off!

11:47.953 --> 11:50.513
- Let's get him out of here!
- They're throwing bricks!

11:50.756 --> 11:52.485
- Look at this!
- Turn the heat on!

11:52.691 --> 11:54.420
Pay your rent, I'll turn it on!

11:55.060 --> 11:56.391
Hey! Hey! Hey!

11:56.595 --> 11:59.826
Throw your beer bottles!
That's what you do with the rent?

12:02.401 --> 12:04.892
- Get in! Get in!
- Go! Go!

12:05.604 --> 12:07.834
Take it easy! This isn't helping!

12:08.040 --> 12:09.439
Get back!

12:09.675 --> 12:12.075
- Dwight, you okay?
- Just got blood in my eyes.

12:12.278 --> 12:14.109
Get out of here. They're animals.

12:14.313 --> 12:16.144
Is Lars trying to be a diplomat?

12:16.348 --> 12:18.009
Just back up a step!

12:18.217 --> 12:20.208
- Son of a bitch!
- Get me out of here!

12:21.153 --> 12:24.145
- When did it start, Lily?
- About two minutes ago.

12:24.390 --> 12:26.620
- Somebody help her!
- I've got more Ativan.

12:26.825 --> 12:29.623
- Push two. Protect the airway.
- Do something, please!

12:29.828 --> 12:31.295
- Dilantin's onboard.
- A gram.

12:31.497 --> 12:34.227
- You did this!
- What's he talking about, Lucy?

12:34.533 --> 12:36.433
You told her about the cancer.

12:36.669 --> 12:38.603
- Look what it's done.
- How's pulse ox?

12:38.804 --> 12:40.601
- Ninety-six.
- We asked you not to.

12:40.806 --> 12:42.967
You wouldn't listen.
This is your fault.

12:43.175 --> 12:44.767
All your fault!

12:45.578 --> 12:46.977
Out of the way! Please!

12:47.179 --> 12:49.545
RA 47, still waiting
for police backup.

12:49.748 --> 12:51.909
- Give me the keys.
- Now you're talking.

12:52.117 --> 12:53.448
- Lars okay?
- I don't know.

12:53.652 --> 12:55.586
<i>Units rolling. ETA three minutes.</i>

12:55.788 --> 12:57.779
He's having trouble getting through.

12:57.990 --> 13:00.322
- They want you, not him.
- Go, Carter, go!

13:00.526 --> 13:01.754
Get out of here!

13:02.261 --> 13:04.889
- How do you work the PA?
- Bottom button.

13:05.464 --> 13:07.125
Stand away from the vehicle!

13:07.333 --> 13:08.391
<i>Coming through here.</i>

13:08.601 --> 13:10.831
Step back from the vehicle.

13:11.170 --> 13:12.228
<i>Stand back!</i>

13:12.504 --> 13:14.597
Coming through! Get off the car!

13:20.779 --> 13:22.110
<i>Nice and easy.</i>

13:22.314 --> 13:23.542
Stop! Stop!

13:24.316 --> 13:25.476
What was that?

13:25.884 --> 13:26.976
I don't know.

13:27.786 --> 13:30.254
- Ran over something.
- Must have been the curb!

13:30.456 --> 13:31.855
Look out the back!

13:32.057 --> 13:34.389
- Give me some room!
- There's a guy down.

13:34.593 --> 13:37.426
- Oh, God! Did I run him over?
- I don't know!

13:37.630 --> 13:39.791
- We gotta stop.
- No, Carter! We gotta go!

13:39.999 --> 13:42.593
- We gotta pick him up!
- They'll finish him first.

13:42.801 --> 13:44.291
Drive, Carter!

13:44.737 --> 13:48.434
- Oh, God!
- Unit 47 requesting second unit.

13:48.641 --> 13:51.269
Thirty-eight hundred block
of Drexel. Man down.

13:51.477 --> 13:54.002
- Ambulance versus pedestrian.
- Oh, God!

13:59.585 --> 14:01.678
- Morning.
- Hey, Mark.

14:01.887 --> 14:04.219
- Another headache?
- Same as yesterday.

14:04.823 --> 14:07.986
- Did it ever go away?
- In the afternoon.

14:09.061 --> 14:12.963
- You should let me do a CT.
- I don't need a head CT, Mark.

14:14.033 --> 14:16.024
At least let me do a neuro exam.

14:17.002 --> 14:21.439
Stop thinking like a doctor.
We know what's causing my headaches.

14:21.640 --> 14:23.073
How's your insomnia?

14:24.209 --> 14:25.369
It's gone.

14:28.547 --> 14:29.536
You talk to him?

14:30.616 --> 14:34.416
No. We both thought it was better
not calling for a while, you know?

14:34.620 --> 14:35.882
Give it some time.

14:37.456 --> 14:40.892
You don't need me to tell you this,
but it's okay to miss him.

14:41.126 --> 14:43.390
- Hell, I miss him.
- I know.

14:43.796 --> 14:46.629
I'm okay. I actually like
coming to work.

14:46.965 --> 14:49.763
Really? Now I am worried about you.

14:50.102 --> 14:52.332
- Move over.
- Hey, these guys saved my ass.

14:52.538 --> 14:54.699
- A great job.
- Lf you'd turned on the heat...

14:54.907 --> 14:56.738
...we wouldn't have had to.
- Carter.

14:56.942 --> 14:59.775
- No neurodeficits. Just a head lac.
- What happened?

14:59.978 --> 15:02.879
Mr. Leonelli decided to instigate
some civil unrest.

15:03.082 --> 15:04.413
Typical angry mob thing.

15:04.683 --> 15:07.345
- They started it!
- Dispatch, what unit was sent...

15:07.553 --> 15:10.488
...to 38th and Drexel?
Are they still on the scene?

15:11.056 --> 15:12.080
What's their ETA?

15:12.291 --> 15:14.521
- Here, you should change that.
- Thanks.

15:15.027 --> 15:18.258
Follow my finger with your eyes.
Good.

15:18.464 --> 15:22.798
- This will teach them a lesson, eh?
- You need to deal with them better.

15:23.035 --> 15:24.297
Carter, outside.

15:24.803 --> 15:26.327
What do you know?

15:26.538 --> 15:28.403
They don't pay their rent!

15:28.640 --> 15:32.098
- They leave a mess!
- Turning off the heat will solve that?

15:32.311 --> 15:34.074
Carter, outside, now!

15:36.715 --> 15:39.047
- Is there a problem?
- He'll be fine.

15:39.251 --> 15:43.381
The problem's with you. Cool off
and I'll finish him up. Go on.

15:50.462 --> 15:52.726
- Will she wake up?
- It's hard to say.

15:52.931 --> 15:55.297
If she does, will there be
permanent damage?

15:55.501 --> 15:58.732
There could be some confusion
or memory loss.

15:58.937 --> 16:00.666
She could've had a stroke.

16:02.207 --> 16:04.505
I want to talk to
a more senior physician.

16:04.710 --> 16:06.701
I'm not happy with her care.

16:06.912 --> 16:09.005
Everything was done properly,
Mr. Fong.

16:09.581 --> 16:11.879
A Medicine Attending will
see her upstairs...

16:12.084 --> 16:13.779
...and we'll check back in a while.

16:19.558 --> 16:22.755
It was a championship tag team match.
This giant of a guy...

16:22.961 --> 16:24.258
...twirls him around.

16:24.463 --> 16:28.058
Then, suddenly he stops,
picks him up, threw him down...

16:28.267 --> 16:30.929
I took Mr. Leonelli to X-ray.
He'll be a while.

16:31.136 --> 16:33.900
- Thanks. Thanks, Yosh.
- Good morning.

16:34.106 --> 16:37.337
- Pleasure to welcome the day shift.
- What's with the boxes?

16:37.543 --> 16:40.376
- They're for Pedes.
- Why aren't they in the Pedes room?

16:40.579 --> 16:43.912
They're addressed to Dr. Ross.
So should I keep them...

16:44.116 --> 16:46.584
...or forward them?
- We still see kids, Jerry.

16:46.785 --> 16:48.616
Even before we had a Pedes.

16:48.821 --> 16:52.655
- Jerry, help me with the boxes.
- IKerry, how was the graveyard shift?

16:52.858 --> 16:56.988
Fairly typical. A few strange
dudes, as Malik would say...

16:57.196 --> 16:59.824
...including Dr. Carter.
- Wasn't he on a ride-along?

17:00.032 --> 17:02.626
- Yes.
- Dr. Carter, we're talking about you.

17:02.835 --> 17:04.097
- You settle down?
- Yeah.

17:04.303 --> 17:07.795
Mr. Leonelli's in X-ray, if you
want to tell him that you're sorry.

17:08.006 --> 17:11.031
I got a bigger problem.
MVA, ambulance versus pedestrian...

17:11.242 --> 17:12.800
...and we were the ambulance.

17:14.246 --> 17:17.339
- Just set them down here?
- Yeah, anywhere's fine.

17:18.617 --> 17:20.346
- Thanks, Jer.
- Sure.

17:29.661 --> 17:33.028
Avery Campbell, 17. Crushed pelvis.
BP 70 at the scene.

17:33.232 --> 17:34.563
Up to 80 with two liters.

17:34.766 --> 17:36.324
- Lars, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

17:36.535 --> 17:37.934
They weren't mad at me.

17:38.136 --> 17:41.799
- This guy needs an airway!
- Okay, one of Pavulon, two Versed...

17:42.007 --> 17:43.201
...a hundred of sux.

17:43.408 --> 17:47.242
- Number eight ET tube.
- CBC, type, cross for eight, Chem-20.

17:47.446 --> 17:50.279
Portable chest, AP pelvis.
Prep for central line.

17:50.482 --> 17:53.280
- BP's 75 palp. Pulse ox 88.
- Two units O-neg.

17:53.485 --> 17:54.611
What have we got?

17:54.887 --> 17:56.616
Ambulance ran over his pelvis.

17:56.822 --> 17:58.983
- Hope it wasn't you, Doris.
- No, it was me.

17:59.191 --> 18:02.160
- You're not supposed to drive.
- I know. Are you in?

18:02.394 --> 18:03.452
I'm in. Bag him.

18:04.596 --> 18:07.622
- Where were the paramedics?
- I got trapped in the crowd.

18:07.833 --> 18:10.700
- How's the airway?
- Good breath sounds.

18:10.903 --> 18:13.030
- What about Zadro?
- He was bleeding.

18:13.238 --> 18:15.138
- Blood to the meatus.
- Damn it!

18:15.340 --> 18:17.865
Could be a torn urethra.
I'll prep a urethrogram.

18:18.076 --> 18:20.010
Supraumbilical peritoneal lavage.

18:20.212 --> 18:21.770
- Did you call the cops?
- We did.

18:22.080 --> 18:23.877
- You didn't wait?
- We'll talk later.

18:24.082 --> 18:27.984
Hook up the rapid infuser.
I need Betadine, gloves and a Foley.

18:28.186 --> 18:29.210
Come on!

18:31.356 --> 18:33.221
- Hey, Jeanie.
- Good morning.

18:33.458 --> 18:36.586
- Getting settled back in?
- Yeah, I'm doing okay.

18:36.795 --> 18:39.730
- Any side effects from the interferon?
- No.

18:39.932 --> 18:40.864
Good.

18:41.066 --> 18:42.863
Maybe you should do fast track.

18:43.068 --> 18:48.005
- Sore throats, sprains, easy stuff.
- I'll stick to triage and paperwork.

18:48.507 --> 18:53.035
Okay. Jeanie,
Al called here last night.

18:55.080 --> 18:57.640
- Did you speak to him?
- Yeah, he was upset...

18:57.849 --> 19:00.875
...about the message you left him.
He couldn't reach you...

19:01.086 --> 19:06.422
- Thanks, but I can handle this.
- I know. He just sounded concerned.

19:06.825 --> 19:11.262
Well, I've had every conversation
with Al I'll ever need to have.

19:11.697 --> 19:14.666
Aside from everything else
he's given me hepatitis C.

19:14.866 --> 19:17.334
There's really nothing
else to talk about.

19:18.470 --> 19:22.270
I gotta cover a meeting, but do you
want to grab a bite to eat later?

19:22.741 --> 19:25.835
No, thanks. I'm having
lunch with a friend.

19:26.111 --> 19:29.410
Got a ruptured bladder
and an open-book fracture.

19:29.614 --> 19:33.141
- Lavage is negative.
- Pressure's 95. Let's get an angio.

19:33.352 --> 19:35.320
- Good work, Carter.
- Not cleared yet.

19:35.520 --> 19:37.715
I'll inform Urology and Ortho.

19:37.923 --> 19:41.120
- His dad wants to talk to someone.
- I should do that.

19:41.326 --> 19:43.226
- Not a good idea.
- Right. I did it.

19:43.428 --> 19:45.157
Exactly.

19:45.364 --> 19:47.662
- It's my responsibility.
- But remember...

19:47.866 --> 19:49.959
...you're this kid's doctor first.
Okay?

19:50.168 --> 19:52.762
Only talk about his medical condition.

19:53.138 --> 19:56.437
Carter, I want you, Zadro and
Audia to find me and fill me in...

19:56.641 --> 19:58.609
...on exactly what happened, okay?

19:58.810 --> 20:01.904
I'll defend you to the police,
hospital administration...

20:02.114 --> 20:04.605
...fire department
and the media, if necessary.

20:04.816 --> 20:06.147
- Make sense?
- Mr. Campbell?

20:06.385 --> 20:08.615
- My God, is he all right?
- I'm Dr. Carter.

20:08.820 --> 20:11.755
Avery's pelvis is broken
with some internal bleeding.

20:11.957 --> 20:14.323
- Do you have to operate?
- Not necessarily.

20:14.526 --> 20:17.927
A radiologist will use a catheter
to stop the bleeding.

20:18.130 --> 20:19.825
Hey, Avery.

20:20.298 --> 20:22.163
- For how long?
- An hour or so.

20:22.367 --> 20:25.734
They said an ambulance ran him over.
Is that right?

20:25.937 --> 20:28.963
- I believe so.
- How could that happen, huh?

20:29.174 --> 20:31.506
We'll know more about
his condition soon.

20:31.710 --> 20:34.338
I'm sorry to bug you,
but I'm gonna bug somebody...

20:34.546 --> 20:36.673
...because somebody
has to pay for that.

20:36.882 --> 20:38.941
Thank you very much, doctor, okay?

20:43.221 --> 20:46.054
- Looks good, Debbie. Any pain?
- It kind of throbs.

20:46.258 --> 20:48.658
- I have trouble sleeping.
- Shouldn't last.

20:48.860 --> 20:51.658
Will it be gone by tonight?
I mean, a lot of trouble.

20:51.863 --> 20:53.160
We'll give you something.

20:53.365 --> 20:57.096
Jeanie, write her for a few Vicodin
and I'll see you in two days.

20:57.302 --> 21:00.203
- Do I keep the splint on?
- Yes, let the tendon heal.

21:01.039 --> 21:04.031
- Now where's my prescription pad?
- Did you drop it?

21:04.242 --> 21:05.607
I hate when this happens.

21:05.811 --> 21:08.974
- Carol, how's your headache?
- Oh, not bad.

21:09.181 --> 21:10.273
Is it still there?

21:10.482 --> 21:13.178
Mark, stop treating me
like I have a brain tumor.

21:13.385 --> 21:14.409
Okay, okay.

21:14.619 --> 21:17.884
Jerry, who is that big guy
over there in Curtain Two?

21:18.090 --> 21:22.151
- That's IKornberg.
- Oh, right, that's who it is.

21:22.360 --> 21:25.193
I hate to be such a girl,
but who's IKornberg?

21:25.430 --> 21:27.591
Used to play for the Denver Broncos.

21:28.033 --> 21:29.796
I'll be in the Suture Room.

21:30.001 --> 21:33.562
Obviously, Dr. Greene
is not a wrestling fan.

21:33.772 --> 21:36.138
- Jerry, hand me a pen, please.
- Sure.

21:36.374 --> 21:37.568
Thank you.

21:41.246 --> 21:43.146
Pharmacy's on the second floor.

21:45.484 --> 21:46.746
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

21:46.952 --> 21:49.011
Get my message about Saturday night?

21:49.221 --> 21:51.849
Yeah. I'm afraid I can't make it.

21:52.057 --> 21:54.287
I have reservations at
Charlie Trotter's.

21:54.493 --> 21:57.621
- That sounds great, but I can't...
- How about Sunday?

21:57.829 --> 22:00.263
Actually, I need to
tell you something.

22:00.932 --> 22:04.891
I feel awkward because I should've
been more up-front from the get go.

22:05.103 --> 22:07.435
But I'm seeing someone else.

22:08.507 --> 22:09.474
Oh.

22:10.275 --> 22:11.105
Right.

22:11.443 --> 22:12.341
I'm sorry.

22:13.245 --> 22:14.473
I'll see you around.

22:16.615 --> 22:17.582
Yeah.

22:18.483 --> 22:19.745
Hello, can we help you?

22:20.785 --> 22:22.810
- Does this thing even work?
- Used to.

22:23.021 --> 22:26.479
- Jerry, what did you do?
- Nothing. It's the bathroom alarm.

22:26.691 --> 22:28.124
- What?
- Trauma hallway.

22:28.326 --> 22:31.193
- Intercom doesn't work.
- Oh, God, I sent Mr. IKingsley...

22:31.396 --> 22:33.421
...in there for a stool sample.

22:34.032 --> 22:36.057
- Mr. IKingsley?
- He didn't feel well.

22:36.268 --> 22:38.361
It's probably just
a false alarm, right?

22:40.438 --> 22:41.803
Mr. IKingsley?

22:42.007 --> 22:44.669
- Mr. IKingsley, are you all right?
- Let me see.

22:45.844 --> 22:47.471
- It's locked.
- Where's the key?

22:47.679 --> 22:51.240
- I'm supposed to have it?
- Call Security, maybe he passed out.

22:51.449 --> 22:52.279
Or had an MI.

22:52.484 --> 22:53.951
- He might be dead.
- Jerry!

22:54.152 --> 22:57.451
Mr. IKingsley! We need to
get this door open right now.

22:57.656 --> 22:59.248
Excuse me. Stand back.

23:05.597 --> 23:06.655
Mr. IKornberg!

23:10.268 --> 23:12.793
- Mr. IKingsley? Lydia, get a gurney!
- Yeah.

23:13.004 --> 23:14.904
- Awesome.
- Are you all right?

23:15.106 --> 23:16.130
Yeah.

23:18.410 --> 23:20.241
Make it two gurneys.

23:25.317 --> 23:28.081
Man, all the good stuff happens
on the night shift!

23:28.286 --> 23:31.346
This photo will be framed
and put up on the mantelpiece.

23:31.556 --> 23:34.889
The unbeatable tag team
of Markovic and IKornberg.

23:35.093 --> 23:36.685
- Excuse me.
- I don't think so.

23:36.895 --> 23:39.796
- I could've been a contender.
- I'm with County Jail.

23:39.998 --> 23:41.590
I'm looking for Dr. Greene.

23:41.800 --> 23:44.826
I've got an inmate
he's treated before. Mobalage Ekabo.

23:45.036 --> 23:47.766
- Mobalage.
- He hasn't been eating or drinking.

23:48.106 --> 23:52.338
He's dehydrated. We need to get him
on IV fluids. Randi, get Mark Greene.

23:52.777 --> 23:54.938
Carter, is this the kid?
How's he doing?

23:55.146 --> 23:58.047
You know what...?
Hang on one second. Mr. Leonelli...

23:58.550 --> 24:00.040
...I just wanted to apologize.

24:00.252 --> 24:03.312
In all the excitement earlier,
I got a little heated.

24:03.521 --> 24:07.457
- I didn't mean to take it out on you.
- IKid, I got thicker skin than that.

24:07.692 --> 24:11.594
Be a hell of a day when I let a
sweet do-gooder baby doc get to me.

24:11.796 --> 24:14.765
- Right. So, feeling better?
- Feeling great.

24:15.567 --> 24:20.266
Have a nice big scar to show the judge
when I take these freeloaders to court.

24:24.476 --> 24:26.444
- How's Avery?
- Taking him up to the O.R.

24:26.645 --> 24:29.671
He's better. They embolized
the bleeders, his BP's 120.

24:29.881 --> 24:31.508
- His spine?
- No lumbar fractures.

24:31.716 --> 24:34.184
- Moved his legs in Radiology.
- So he'll make it?

24:34.386 --> 24:36.684
- Be up in a couple of months.
- Thank God!

24:36.888 --> 24:39.322
Nice work.
We needed a good outcome on this.

24:39.524 --> 24:42.982
- Dr. Greene, Carol's looking for you.
- All right.

24:43.194 --> 24:47.460
- Why'd you even try that?
- When you're my size, it's expected.

24:47.666 --> 24:49.691
- IKind of like signing autographs?
- Yeah.

24:49.901 --> 24:52.665
I don't want any hurt feelings.
IKeep everybody happy.

24:53.071 --> 24:56.131
- Even if you're not happy?
- I never thought about it.

24:56.341 --> 24:59.572
I was always "the big guy."
Played football and wrestled.

24:59.778 --> 25:01.370
Friends ask me to help them move...

25:01.646 --> 25:03.671
...always ask me to play Santa Claus.

25:04.816 --> 25:06.215
So you do.

25:10.355 --> 25:12.186
- Has he said anything?
- Nothing.

25:12.390 --> 25:15.757
Sheriff said he hasn't spoken
since his first day in jail.

25:16.695 --> 25:18.856
- Can you undo that, please?
- Sure.

25:19.197 --> 25:20.960
Hi, Mobalage.

25:21.900 --> 25:23.265
How are you doing?

25:25.870 --> 25:29.567
You're dehydrated. We need your
permission to give you IV fluids.

25:29.774 --> 25:31.867
Do you have any objections?

25:33.912 --> 25:34.936
Go ahead.

25:36.715 --> 25:38.808
Has anyone filled you in on IKobe?

25:45.090 --> 25:48.651
She's upstairs
in the Intensive Care Unit.

25:48.860 --> 25:50.851
The surgery went well.

25:51.062 --> 25:52.552
But she's in a coma.

25:52.764 --> 25:55.858
However, there's a very good chance
that she'll wake up.

25:56.067 --> 25:57.967
You're gonna feel a needle stick.

25:58.403 --> 26:00.735
I've seen how much you love your wife.

26:01.539 --> 26:03.700
I know you didn't intend to hurt her.

26:03.975 --> 26:06.705
I believe your response
was out of your control.

26:08.313 --> 26:10.838
All we want to do is help you.

26:12.384 --> 26:14.011
Do you understand?

26:19.057 --> 26:23.118
My father didn't want me to get you.
My grandmother woke up very confused.

26:23.328 --> 26:25.853
The fact that she's conscious
is a good sign.

26:26.431 --> 26:28.023
- Dilantin level is 15.
- Right.

26:28.233 --> 26:30.064
She doesn't remember coming here.

26:30.268 --> 26:33.260
There's some memory loss.
Tell her she had a seizure.

26:33.471 --> 26:34.665
I want another doctor.

26:38.676 --> 26:41.236
Mr. Fong, I'm just trying
to help your mother.

26:41.446 --> 26:45.507
All I'm asking you to do
is to tell her that she had a seizure.

27:00.198 --> 27:01.961
She wants to know why.

27:07.705 --> 27:11.334
What you've experienced
is fairly common, so don't worry.

27:11.543 --> 27:15.445
You had a seizure because you have
a condition called epilepsy.

27:15.914 --> 27:17.541
But you're gonna be fine.

27:21.486 --> 27:23.044
Thank you, doctor.

27:27.459 --> 27:28.653
ER.

27:29.027 --> 27:31.427
Jeanie, you got a call.
It's the pharmacy.

27:31.629 --> 27:32.653
- Okay.
- Hi.

27:32.897 --> 27:34.387
Thanks. Hi.

27:34.599 --> 27:38.000
- How can it be this cold in March?
- Yeah. I have a phone call.

27:38.203 --> 27:41.331
That's okay, I'm doing a DUI report.
I'll catch you later.

27:41.539 --> 27:42.699
- Okay.
- All right.

27:42.907 --> 27:44.534
This is Jeanie Boulet.

27:44.909 --> 27:47.207
It was a prescription
for Debbie Anderson.

27:47.412 --> 27:50.245
She was in here earlier
with a hand laceration.

27:50.715 --> 27:54.173
No. It's for four tablets, not 40.

27:55.220 --> 27:56.847
Can you fax it over?

27:57.622 --> 28:01.080
Just send her back here.
I'll take care of it. Thank you.

28:01.526 --> 28:05.018
Randi, let me know when a fax comes in
from Blue Hills Pharmacy.

28:05.230 --> 28:07.824
- I was just about to call you.
- About IKobe Ekabo?

28:08.032 --> 28:10.432
- How'd you know?
- I heard her husband came in.

28:10.635 --> 28:13.536
- She's had spontaneous eye-opening.
- That's a good sign.

28:13.738 --> 28:14.705
How's he doing?

28:14.939 --> 28:17.908
I don't feel so bad
having insomnia and headaches.

28:18.109 --> 28:19.167
You have headaches?

28:19.377 --> 28:21.470
I thought of another reason for those.

28:21.679 --> 28:24.341
- Mark's trying to cure me.
- Carbon monoxide poisoning.

28:24.549 --> 28:27.985
- Old houses can have faulty furnaces.
- Not venting the exhaust.

28:28.186 --> 28:30.381
- Do you wake up with them?
- Yes, she does.

28:30.588 --> 28:31.782
Could be that, then.

28:32.557 --> 28:35.048
- Let's get a carboxyhemoglobin.
- Who's on Trauma?

28:35.260 --> 28:36.591
- I am.
- Here if you need me.

28:36.794 --> 28:39.058
12-year-old, 10-foot fall,
five minutes out.

28:39.264 --> 28:40.526
I'm gonna need you.

28:43.701 --> 28:44.690
Excuse me.

28:44.903 --> 28:46.837
Sir. Excuse me.

28:47.038 --> 28:50.701
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave Mr. IKornberg alone.

28:50.909 --> 28:53.469
I am Mr. IKornberg. Senior.

28:53.678 --> 28:55.111
Hey, doc, this is my dad.

28:55.313 --> 28:56.905
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

28:57.115 --> 28:58.810
And his biggest fan.

28:59.017 --> 29:01.850
Thank you for taking
wonderful care of my boy.

29:02.053 --> 29:04.647
Except I want his trainer
to look at his hand.

29:04.856 --> 29:07.916
- Really, I'm fine.
- I'm so sorry about what happened.

29:08.126 --> 29:11.095
Nonsense.
My son performed a mitzvah.

29:11.696 --> 29:13.596
An act of virtue.

29:14.499 --> 29:17.696
You wouldn't believe what
a publicist could do with that.

29:17.902 --> 29:21.133
Oh, by the way,
do you have a children's ward?

29:21.339 --> 29:23.739
- Yes, upstairs.
- Good!

29:23.942 --> 29:26.172
- We're going.
- Excuse me?

29:26.578 --> 29:30.070
- Visit the sick kids.
- No, I'm sorry. He needs to rest.

29:30.281 --> 29:32.715
He can't shake hands
with a few children?

29:32.917 --> 29:36.250
Bring a little joy into their lives?
For millions...

29:36.454 --> 29:38.251
...my son is a hero.

29:40.124 --> 29:43.821
Marci Canchola, fell from the second
story onto a wrought-iron fence.

29:44.028 --> 29:47.293
Fire department cut it.
Good vitals but no room to intubate.

29:47.498 --> 29:50.194
Okay, everybody,
let's do this nice and gentle.

29:50.401 --> 29:52.926
Ready? And go.

29:53.404 --> 29:54.462
I need suction.

29:54.672 --> 29:56.572
We're gonna take good care of you.

29:56.774 --> 29:58.901
Parents are on their way,
in hysterics.

29:59.110 --> 30:02.443
I need a full trauma panel.
Type and cross for four.

30:02.647 --> 30:04.342
I can't get a laryngoscope in.

30:04.549 --> 30:07.074
- No room for a crike.
- Get a fiber-optic scope.

30:07.285 --> 30:08.547
A number six ET tube.

30:08.753 --> 30:11.221
- Pulse ox is 92.
- Oxygen up to 15 liters.

30:11.422 --> 30:14.391
- BP's 100 palp.
- Pulse 120.

30:15.026 --> 30:16.687
High on the suction.

30:17.061 --> 30:19.393
Pulse ox down to 87. Hurry up, Mark.

30:20.365 --> 30:21.354
I can't see.

30:22.266 --> 30:24.666
I can't see. There's too much blood.

30:24.869 --> 30:26.564
I'll be back. Prep the neck.

30:40.585 --> 30:42.348
Suction. I can't see the cords.

30:42.553 --> 30:44.646
Pulse ox still falling.
BP's down to 70.

30:44.856 --> 30:47.916
- Here's a pediatric crike Doug ordered.
- Bar's in the way.

30:48.126 --> 30:51.892
- Try to get the needle in.
- She's throwing PVCs. Pulse ox is 85.

30:52.096 --> 30:54.929
Aspirate air.
Make sure you're in the trachea.

30:55.833 --> 30:58.927
Now it's just a Seldinger technique
with a guide wire.

31:00.638 --> 31:02.697
- Tube, please.
- Right here.

31:03.408 --> 31:04.966
We need to bag her.

31:06.477 --> 31:07.569
Okay.

31:08.046 --> 31:09.240
That's pretty nifty.

31:12.750 --> 31:15.082
- Good breath sounds.
- Pulse ox is up to 89.

31:15.286 --> 31:17.584
Dr. Corday?
They need you in the SICU.

31:17.789 --> 31:20.189
- Okay, we can take it from here.
- Okay.

31:21.759 --> 31:24.091
Good thing those supplies
came in today.

31:24.295 --> 31:27.162
Yeah. Looks like Doug
just saved another kid.

31:27.365 --> 31:29.663
Actually, Carol, I'd say you did.

31:32.236 --> 31:35.000
- You want to arrest her?
- She forged a prescription.

31:35.206 --> 31:37.401
Changed four to 40. "F-O-U-R-T-Y."

31:37.608 --> 31:39.633
That's fraud. Violation of DEA laws.

31:39.844 --> 31:43.177
If I arrest her, you gotta come
to the station, file a report...

31:43.381 --> 31:45.212
...spend two days
waiting to testify...

31:45.416 --> 31:48.442
...then watch the judge toss it
because it's a first offense.

31:48.653 --> 31:50.382
- Great. Arrest her.
- My advice?

31:50.588 --> 31:54.786
A scrip for five can't be changed to
"fifty." Then you're free for lunch.

31:54.992 --> 31:56.823
I can't have lunch with you.

31:57.028 --> 31:58.791
- Then dinner.
- I can't.

31:59.731 --> 32:03.428
- You gonna take this out on me?
- No, Reggie. It's just...

32:03.634 --> 32:07.570
I need to tell you something.
I haven't been completely honest.

32:08.306 --> 32:10.035
No time like the present.

32:11.042 --> 32:12.339
I'm seeing someone else.

32:14.145 --> 32:16.079
I thought we had something going.

32:16.280 --> 32:17.804
I know. And I'm sorry.

32:18.015 --> 32:21.678
It just isn't gonna work out.
I need to get back to work.

32:22.286 --> 32:25.153
- Can we at least talk about this?
- I don't think so.

32:25.523 --> 32:27.013
I'm gonna call you.

32:27.291 --> 32:29.657
<i>County, this is Zadro, Rescue 47.</i>

32:29.861 --> 32:31.488
<i>My partner's been shot.</i>

32:31.696 --> 32:35.757
- What are the vital signs?
<i>- Can't get them. He's unconscious.</i>

32:35.967 --> 32:39.698
- This is Carter. What happened?
<i>- We got ambushed. They shot Lars.</i>

32:39.904 --> 32:43.431
- Shot him? Where are his wounds?
<i>- I can't tell. Too much blood.</i>

32:43.641 --> 32:46.109
All right, just get here.
Get here.

32:49.213 --> 32:50.908
Lungs sound good.

32:52.150 --> 32:53.549
Hi, IKobe.

32:53.985 --> 32:55.111
How you feeling?

32:55.319 --> 32:58.618
Dr. Greene. Where is my husband?

32:58.823 --> 33:02.224
IKobe, you were stabbed
and you've been in a coma.

33:03.027 --> 33:05.461
I don't think Mobalage
intended to hurt you.

33:05.663 --> 33:06.687
He wasn't himself.

33:06.898 --> 33:08.957
Oh, God!

33:09.167 --> 33:10.794
Mobalage...

33:12.470 --> 33:14.597
That is not true.

33:14.806 --> 33:18.799
I think your husband suffers from
what's known as posttraumatic stress.

33:19.410 --> 33:21.241
He did not hurt me.

33:22.113 --> 33:23.444
What do you mean?

33:24.849 --> 33:27.044
I want... I wanted to die.

33:28.719 --> 33:30.584
I was so ashamed.

33:31.889 --> 33:34.255
L... I took the knife.

33:36.260 --> 33:38.125
I did this.

33:47.672 --> 33:49.264
Oh, God!

33:53.077 --> 33:56.205
- Get me a C-collar!
- Looks like head, neck, chest.

33:56.581 --> 33:57.570
Got a faint pulse.

33:57.782 --> 33:59.841
- Ready with the backboard.
- Hang on.

34:00.585 --> 34:01.779
Okay, slide it in.

34:03.321 --> 34:04.982
How's his airway?

34:05.256 --> 34:09.283
Shallow resps. Get ready to bag him.
All right, very careful.

34:11.596 --> 34:13.291
Tube's in. Use the Thora-Seal.

34:13.496 --> 34:14.862
- His pressure?
- 80 palp.

34:15.065 --> 34:16.533
- And the Thora-Seal?
- Wait.

34:16.734 --> 34:18.964
Got a subclavian.
Hang the type-specific.

34:19.170 --> 34:21.331
- Set up for a central line.
- We have one.

34:21.539 --> 34:22.870
- Let's have two.
- One is fine.

34:23.306 --> 34:25.366
- What if it infiltrates?
- Won't happen.

34:25.576 --> 34:27.873
Even if it does,
we got two antecubitals.

34:28.079 --> 34:29.842
- You all right?
- How's he doing?

34:30.047 --> 34:32.072
- I'll take over.
- I'm going to the O.R.

34:32.315 --> 34:34.944
Came around the corner.
They were waiting for us.

34:35.152 --> 34:37.518
- Was Lars driving?
- It all went down so fast.

34:37.722 --> 34:40.246
- I couldn't tell what...
- Was Lars driving?

34:40.625 --> 34:42.922
- Yeah.
- They were shooting for me.

34:44.262 --> 34:46.594
I was driving last night.
They wanted me.

34:51.202 --> 34:52.726
Mr. IKornberg.

34:54.105 --> 34:57.040
- You were looking for me?
- I wanted to say thank you.

34:57.275 --> 35:00.335
We're leaving after Dad's
done with the photographer.

35:00.544 --> 35:02.876
Photos from the Pediatrics Ward, huh?

35:03.514 --> 35:06.449
Nurse handed out balloons.
A little boy gave me his.

35:06.751 --> 35:09.811
- You can't get away from it, can you?
- IKids know who I am.

35:10.021 --> 35:12.922
Their faces light up.
Plus, it makes my dad proud.

35:13.124 --> 35:14.785
You know how parents can be.

35:15.726 --> 35:16.886
- Thanks again.
- Okay.

35:17.094 --> 35:18.584
- Take care.
- You're welcome.

35:19.864 --> 35:20.990
<i>I want to go in.</i>

35:21.198 --> 35:23.632
We'll explore the chest.
Stop the bleeding.

35:23.834 --> 35:25.131
Neurosurgery will look...

35:25.336 --> 35:28.328
- You gonna let me in?
- I'll be with him. You stay here.

35:29.840 --> 35:31.899
- What are you doing?
- Scrubbing in.

35:32.310 --> 35:36.440
- Aren't you on duty in the ER?
- No. I worked last night.

35:36.948 --> 35:39.439
That was the ride-along
with this fellow?

35:39.650 --> 35:40.639
That's right.

35:40.851 --> 35:43.411
- There's isn't enough room.
- What do you mean?

35:43.621 --> 35:46.818
We've got General Surgery,
Neurosurgery and Thoracic.

35:47.024 --> 35:50.289
- I'll scrub out if I have to.
- We appreciate your concern.

35:50.494 --> 35:55.090
But it might be best if you watched
from the observation gallery.

36:02.540 --> 36:03.939
Feeling better?

36:04.175 --> 36:05.733
Fluids should help.

36:11.115 --> 36:12.275
I talked to IKobe.

36:13.217 --> 36:15.845
She woke up
and she's doing much better.

36:17.588 --> 36:20.716
She also told me
that you didn't hurt her.

36:27.098 --> 36:29.726
The paramedics showed up...

36:30.534 --> 36:33.230
...flashing lights and the sirens...

36:33.437 --> 36:35.064
...and the pounding on the door.

36:35.272 --> 36:37.103
That must have scared you.

36:38.342 --> 36:39.707
Yes.

36:43.647 --> 36:45.444
Is that why you ran away?

36:48.652 --> 36:50.677
Why didn't you tell the police?

36:51.322 --> 36:53.381
Why did you say it was your fault?

36:54.291 --> 36:56.816
It was my fault what happened to her.

36:58.496 --> 37:01.897
When I left Nigeria the soldiers came.

37:02.233 --> 37:03.325
They raped her...

37:05.369 --> 37:06.802
...because of me.

37:08.773 --> 37:10.536
I left her alone.

37:11.609 --> 37:15.807
When she told me,
I couldn't look at her.

37:17.114 --> 37:19.082
I couldn't talk to her.

37:21.986 --> 37:23.783
She was alone again.

37:23.988 --> 37:25.888
And that's when she took the...

37:28.059 --> 37:30.118
She took the knife.

37:35.332 --> 37:37.095
She needed me.

37:40.237 --> 37:42.000
And I left her.

37:45.142 --> 37:46.871
She needs you now.

37:53.451 --> 37:55.009
I need more suction.

37:55.219 --> 37:56.208
2-0 Vicryl.

37:56.420 --> 37:58.354
He's oozing all over the place.

37:58.556 --> 38:02.356
Shirley, get me some FFP
and platelets now.

38:03.694 --> 38:06.925
- What's going on in there?
- I'm going to the blood bank.

38:07.131 --> 38:08.621
They using the cell saver?

38:08.833 --> 38:12.234
- Have they called Neurosurgery?
- I don't know. I need to get blood.

38:17.108 --> 38:20.339
<i>- Should we set up for bypass?</i>
- Not necessary.

38:20.544 --> 38:24.776
There are no intracardiac injuries.
Vascular clamp.

38:24.982 --> 38:27.473
<i>- Have you called Neurosurgery yet?</i>
- We will!

38:34.658 --> 38:37.821
Yeah, hi. I need Neurosurgery
to O.R. Three, please.

38:38.028 --> 38:39.427
O.R. Three.

38:53.377 --> 38:56.403
We took her statement.
D.A. Agreed to drop the charges.

38:56.714 --> 38:59.649
- I wish it was all good news.
- What's up?

38:59.850 --> 39:02.318
Immigration Service
contacted the department.

39:02.520 --> 39:05.455
Mr. Ekabo came into the country
on a forged visa.

39:05.656 --> 39:07.681
- What does that mean?
- He's an illegal.

39:07.892 --> 39:09.257
He's going back to jail?

39:09.460 --> 39:11.826
No, but INS will hold
a deportation hearing.

39:12.029 --> 39:13.656
To send him back to Nigeria?

39:13.998 --> 39:15.090
That's how it works.

39:24.542 --> 39:27.568
- You from Neurosurgery?
- No, Radiology. I got the CTs.

39:27.778 --> 39:28.972
I'll take these.

39:33.584 --> 39:37.520
<i>Films show bullet fragments</i>
<i>in the right parietal lobe.</i>

39:38.522 --> 39:41.821
- Neck wounds, shattered C-4.
- Thank you, Dr. Carter.

39:42.026 --> 39:45.553
<i>- I didn't know if you could read them.</i>
- Neurosurgery wants the CTs.

39:45.763 --> 39:48.596
- What'd they say?
- That they were called in too soon.

39:49.433 --> 39:51.765
V-fib.
Starting internal compressions.

39:51.969 --> 39:55.871
Give me the paddles.
Charge to 15. Come on, let's move!

39:56.574 --> 40:00.101
- Heart's empty. He needs volume.
- Okay, here we go. Clear!

40:01.679 --> 40:03.977
Okay, let's go again. Charge to 30.

40:04.181 --> 40:06.046
- Clear!
- Come on!

40:06.250 --> 40:08.548
Okay, charge again. Clear!

40:10.654 --> 40:12.121
- Hey, Jeanie.
- Hey.

40:12.323 --> 40:13.312
What are you doing?

40:13.524 --> 40:15.617
Just checking out some old charts.

40:15.826 --> 40:19.159
- Looking for anything specific?
- I talked to Al today.

40:19.363 --> 40:23.595
He tested negative for hepatitis C.
He even faxed me his results.

40:23.801 --> 40:26.429
Which means I probably got it
from a patient.

40:27.204 --> 40:30.901
They're all so worried, the chance
of me infecting someone with HIV.

40:31.108 --> 40:33.975
Never even thought
about a patient infecting me.

40:35.012 --> 40:37.845
But it could've happened
to any one of us, right?

40:41.085 --> 40:45.215
Jeanie, do you want to go get
a cup of coffee or something?

40:45.422 --> 40:47.549
No, thanks. I'm gonna stay here.

40:47.758 --> 40:49.385
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

40:49.593 --> 40:51.117
Okay, IKerry.

41:01.305 --> 41:02.363
Carol.

41:03.574 --> 41:04.905
What are you doing?

41:05.342 --> 41:08.834
Unloading these boxes.
Doug ordered a lot of supplies.

41:09.046 --> 41:10.673
Have you spoken with him?

41:12.349 --> 41:14.544
I thought about it a lot last night.

41:15.486 --> 41:19.980
I ended up calling the Home Shopping
Network and ordered a pair of booties.

41:21.992 --> 41:25.792
So did Mark manage to strap you down
and get a blood gas?

41:25.996 --> 41:28.055
He finally talked me into it.

41:28.332 --> 41:31.824
It was easier doing that
than listening to him.

41:32.036 --> 41:34.504
My carbon monoxide level was normal.

41:34.738 --> 41:37.002
Oh, well, it was a good guess.

41:37.207 --> 41:40.108
Mark's just trying to be
a friend in that endearing...

41:40.311 --> 41:43.007
...slightly inept, male kind of way.

41:43.347 --> 41:44.541
I know.

41:46.216 --> 41:47.240
I'm a week late.

41:49.687 --> 41:51.086
You're what?

41:51.955 --> 41:54.446
At first I thought it was just stress.

41:55.025 --> 41:56.356
But it's not.

41:59.396 --> 42:00.624
I'm pregnant.

42:14.111 --> 42:15.339
Yeah.

42:30.361 --> 42:31.851
It was a good effort.

42:32.663 --> 42:33.687
Yeah.

42:35.299 --> 42:36.960
Thank you, everyone.

42:41.004 --> 42:44.667
- Carter, let's go.
- I'm just gonna stay for a second.
