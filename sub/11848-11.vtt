02:02.979 --> 02:06.108
I got you...
You sucker!

02:26.607 --> 02:28.506
You're not done yet.

03:05.913 --> 03:08.726
<i>Grab the fox you old folks.</i>

03:13.614 --> 03:15.687
Jesus Christ!

03:17.713 --> 03:20.970
- How far are we from Ganderton?
- More than an hour still.

03:21.398 --> 03:24.428
- Is there anything around?
- Just a little trading post we passed...

03:24.429 --> 03:26.888
...some 20 miles back.

03:26.889 --> 03:28.196
Guess you could stop there.

03:28.197 --> 03:31.124
Some nice bathrooms, snacks...
Stretch your legs, you know?

03:31.936 --> 03:34.046
What about up ahead?

03:34.047 --> 03:39.072
Hotel Alton.  The highway is some...
12 or 14 miles up.

03:39.232 --> 03:41.324
Well, that'll have to do!

03:41.325 --> 03:43.200
Well, I think you
ought to stay as a group.

03:44.305 --> 03:46.686
I am not responsible if you get lost.

03:48.600 --> 03:49.872
Hey?

03:50.431 --> 03:52.939
Not going to walk, are you?

03:53.229 --> 03:56.324
- Nobody walks.
- Nobody reads, either.

03:56.325 --> 03:58.956
Alright, all alone in the open road...

03:58.957 --> 04:01.653
Sure you don't want me
to ride shotgun for you?

04:02.411 --> 04:03.657
No way.

04:03.969 --> 04:05.620
You see... this?

04:05.721 --> 04:07.734
This is the only friend I need.

04:07.795 --> 04:09.779
Hey, I was only asking, okay?

04:09.780 --> 04:11.962
- Yeah, aha!
- Christ!

04:11.963 --> 04:14.040
She's a nutjob!

04:15.427 --> 04:19.993
Woah... Wait here.
That bad, huh?

04:20.713 --> 04:23.064
I mean, so young, so bitter?

04:24.112 --> 04:27.373
- Have you ever been married?
- Oh yeah.

04:27.374 --> 04:30.193
- Been there done that!
- Has he ever hit you?

04:30.194 --> 04:34.677
Honey, anybody who ever
strikes me, strikes me once.

04:35.066 --> 04:37.805
Hey, I see you still
wearing your ring, though!

04:38.113 --> 04:41.098
This is to remind me
of my past mistakes.

04:42.114 --> 04:43.644
I'll see you.

04:44.193 --> 04:46.136
You take care now honey.

04:46.502 --> 04:48.594
I almost always do.

04:48.595 --> 04:50.130
<i>Can't you call AAA or something?</i>

04:50.131 --> 04:53.250
<i>Yeah a great idea.  I just
called a little hip tow-truck.</i>

05:25.083 --> 05:28.964
Well, well.  Would you look at this!
You got a problem here.

05:28.965 --> 05:30.812
I can't get anybody on the damn radio...

05:30.813 --> 05:33.910
Yeah... yeah.
You mind the lacquer there, pal.

05:34.464 --> 05:38.760
I can take a few of these
passengers up to the trading post

05:38.761 --> 05:42.372
if they don't mind riding
in the sleeper back of me.

05:42.835 --> 05:44.990
Hey, heads up!

05:44.991 --> 05:50.153
The trading post.  They got a damn
good breakfast up there, great coffee...

05:50.154 --> 05:52.271
and phones that actually work.

05:52.272 --> 05:55.919
- I've got to stay with the bus.
- Oh, anybody else?

05:56.011 --> 05:57.937
That works for me.

05:58.622 --> 06:01.378
Anybody else?
Last call!

06:01.379 --> 06:04.616
As long as you promise, you're
not some psycho or something.

06:05.344 --> 06:08.070
I promise Miss...
What's your name?

06:08.071 --> 06:11.553
- Birdy.
- Birdy...

06:11.554 --> 06:14.193
We can't just go with some dumb
trucker that comes out of nowhere!

06:14.194 --> 06:16.709
- What the hell is that?
- Get cool. He will hear you!

06:16.710 --> 06:19.159
Fuck him!  No one with
brains take us anymore.

06:19.160 --> 06:20.976
He's probably just gonna
grind us into cat food, and...

06:20.977 --> 06:23.395
sell me into white slavery
or some goddam thing!

06:23.430 --> 06:24.708
Marie, just relax...

06:24.809 --> 06:26.646
Hey, who gets to ride upfront?

06:26.647 --> 06:30.912
Who do you think?  This pretty lady
here who is going to ride upfront.

06:32.718 --> 06:34.217
Let's go.
Let's get inside.

06:34.218 --> 06:36.415
No thanks.
Have a nice day!

06:36.976 --> 06:40.025
- Probable lunatic!
- Great, good one.  Perfect!

06:40.063 --> 06:41.737
Wow, right over the back?

06:41.935 --> 06:44.681
- Wow!  It's pretty big back here...
- Hey, go easy!

06:45.375 --> 06:47.392
We could have fit everybody in here.

06:49.701 --> 06:53.254
Wow!  You sure travel in luxury, okay.

06:53.255 --> 06:55.929
Well, it's home!
Seat-belt, please.

06:56.762 --> 07:00.323
- So what are you carrying in the back?
- Meat.

07:00.781 --> 07:03.223
You know, they say meat's
dangerous nowadays,

07:03.224 --> 07:07.260
with all those growth hormones,
not to mention mad cow.

07:07.261 --> 07:09.509
Oh, mad cow...

07:10.833 --> 07:14.047
Come on!  You promised me you
wouldn't gonna be a lunatic...

07:14.148 --> 07:18.828
Mine is all organic meat!
Kosher!

07:19.329 --> 07:22.105
Let's get rolling.
When pick up we'll tell you both.

07:37.195 --> 07:39.536
So, what kind of engine
you got there, Frank?

07:39.649 --> 07:43.491
Four and a quarter cat, 18 speed...

07:43.492 --> 07:45.290
double locking differential...

07:45.291 --> 07:48.470
Woah... wait.  Let's plain.
Don't need no chapter and verse...

07:50.892 --> 07:53.705
I really love the way you **!

07:54.455 --> 07:58.583
I bet you know how to ride...
I mean, drive this dick.

07:58.584 --> 08:01.684
- It's my preference.
- I'm glad to hear you say that.

08:01.685 --> 08:03.566
It made my day!

08:03.567 --> 08:06.427
You sound like a city fella to me.

08:06.577 --> 08:12.213
Actually I was raised in all five
boroughs in New York at the same time.

08:12.867 --> 08:17.621
And it's too crowded up there, too
congested... took me a fucking witnesses!

08:17.772 --> 08:20.802
- Witnesses?
-  Eight witnesses...

08:20.803 --> 08:26.260
- And does that make me a bad person?
- No worse than any one else, I guess.

08:26.319 --> 08:28.901
When I'm lonesome, I pick someone up,

08:28.902 --> 08:31.638
give them a ride, make conversation...

08:31.772 --> 08:34.746
sometimes I even let them go!

08:36.216 --> 08:38.472
Well, that's reassuring...

08:38.850 --> 08:40.893
So, you're not scared of me, right?

08:40.894 --> 08:43.121
I'm a normal person, right?

08:43.121 --> 08:45.836
Mister, I ain't never met
anybody that was normal.

08:45.842 --> 08:48.495
Not after I got to know 'em anyway.

08:53.111 --> 08:55.249
Hello...

08:56.206 --> 08:58.613
Hello...

08:59.689 --> 09:01.296
Hello!

09:01.950 --> 09:03.619
Well...

09:05.366 --> 09:07.280
You all headed up
anywhere near Landsdale?

09:07.281 --> 09:09.337
We ain't headed nowhere
right this minute!

09:09.640 --> 09:11.338
- What?  A breakdown?
- Yeah...

09:11.339 --> 09:14.307
I think it was trying ** up and died.

09:14.308 --> 09:16.411
Well!  That sucks!

09:16.926 --> 09:18.497
You're telling me!

09:18.498 --> 09:21.897
So in theory then, if you had not broken
down, you would have given me a ride?

09:21.898 --> 09:23.236
Sure, amigo.

09:23.237 --> 09:25.186
You got the fare...
I got the ride!

09:25.187 --> 09:26.919
That's what I was hoping.

09:28.689 --> 09:30.171
How many have you got?

09:30.549 --> 09:32.149
Just those two.

09:32.150 --> 09:34.819
- Hey.
- Don't talk to me, schmuck.

09:34.820 --> 09:35.720
Marie?

09:35.721 --> 09:38.326
Some guy just strolls in here out of
nowhere and he could be a child molester...

09:38.327 --> 09:41.387
Honey, honey, would it put you out
terribly if I say for 5 minutes...

09:41.388 --> 09:43.837
...you might keep your fucking
paranoia to yourself?

09:43.838 --> 09:45.276
Shut up!

09:45.277 --> 09:47.006
Fuck!

09:47.340 --> 09:49.799
You don't talk to me
in that tone, mister!

09:49.931 --> 09:51.644
You have to respect me!

09:51.645 --> 09:54.398
Everybody else caught a ride
back to that roadside store.

09:54.399 --> 09:57.053
You mean someone offered you
guys a ride and you didn't take it?

09:57.192 --> 09:58.589
That goes against my principles.

09:58.590 --> 10:01.329
I have to stick on by
to get this old bus rolling.

10:01.330 --> 10:03.006
If they can.

10:03.577 --> 10:05.030
So you just gonna hang around?

10:05.231 --> 10:07.007
- Only for a little bit.
- Smoke?

10:07.008 --> 10:08.619
No, sir, I don't.

10:11.670 --> 10:13.559
What the hell is that?

10:14.652 --> 10:16.288
- Well, this?
- Yeah...

10:16.289 --> 10:18.004
Just a little bit of road kill.

10:18.005 --> 10:19.940
- What?
- Yeah.  You wanna touch it?

10:19.941 --> 10:22.440
- No fucking way!
- That thing ain't gonna hurt you!

10:22.441 --> 10:25.008
Talk into the mic... Come on.

10:25.009 --> 10:27.221
Come on.  Talk into the mic.
Where are you from?

10:27.887 --> 10:29.632
From planet Earth.
Where are you from?

10:29.747 --> 10:31.227
Hey, this thing on?

10:32.313 --> 10:34.286
You wanna play?

10:34.287 --> 10:36.153
No, no... people are afraid of snakes.

10:36.268 --> 10:38.508
They think they're slimy.
They don't want to touch 'em.

10:38.509 --> 10:40.316
The fact is, you notice...

10:40.350 --> 10:41.764
It's pretty sturdy!

10:42.045 --> 10:43.307
Come on, don't be afraid!

10:43.308 --> 10:44.883
Get that thing out of my face!

10:50.950 --> 10:53.229
Well, you're a big one, ain't you?

10:53.919 --> 10:57.272
Maybe dead things can't hurt you...

11:08.256 --> 11:10.523
I'll get to you!
I'll get to you!

11:12.158 --> 11:13.673
Shit!

11:15.118 --> 11:16.957
- Stop!
- Stop right there, man!

11:32.637 --> 11:35.290
You better not tattle!

11:37.501 --> 11:39.191
I got work to do.

11:59.532 --> 12:01.336
Where is the rest of my stuff?

12:01.437 --> 12:02.968
Right here, sir.

12:05.164 --> 12:08.602
You're obviously
a junk food addict, huh?

12:08.715 --> 12:12.039
Excuse me, is there is
anything wrong with **?

12:12.219 --> 12:14.331
No, it was only a joke.

12:14.940 --> 12:17.702
Is that why I'm laughing so hard...

12:19.077 --> 12:22.183
I also like two cartons of them,

12:22.184 --> 12:25.725
because I'm a nicotine addict too.

12:28.157 --> 12:29.511
Got one of this?

12:30.562 --> 12:32.311
Have you got a piece back there?

12:32.312 --> 12:35.722
- A gun?
- No, no!  I... I...

12:35.723 --> 12:38.063
I don't have a gun...

12:38.465 --> 12:39.328
Now...

12:39.804 --> 12:42.817
Don't be afraid.

12:42.818 --> 12:45.504
This eliminates fear.

12:46.052 --> 12:51.152
You just point it, and people fall down.

12:57.402 --> 12:58.570
Here.

12:58.762 --> 13:00.169
Go on.  Take.

13:00.775 --> 13:01.804
Now...

13:01.805 --> 13:04.035
Point it at me.

13:04.036 --> 13:06.300
- It's heavy.
- No, no... come on.

13:08.008 --> 13:11.940
Do you feel more in control...

13:11.941 --> 13:14.559
with more power?

13:14.560 --> 13:18.302
Now all you need is the will to kill.

13:19.182 --> 13:20.711
Pal...

13:22.922 --> 13:26.171
Hell here!  Keep this gun.
You're gonna need it.

13:28.235 --> 13:29.932
Why are you being so generous?

13:29.933 --> 13:34.388
Why, I like these rest stops,
these convenience stores,

13:34.389 --> 13:36.775
and punks are trying
on getting robbed...

13:36.776 --> 13:38.911
I mean, that's why, and I hate that!

13:38.912 --> 13:41.087
- I loathe punks.
- Yeah, me too.

13:41.948 --> 13:44.294
- "Cocksucker"
- Yeah.

13:45.220 --> 13:47.406
Oh, wait a minute.
I forgot something.

13:51.267 --> 13:53.352
You see... man.

13:53.479 --> 13:56.793
I left one in the pipe!

13:56.794 --> 13:59.550
Oh... you mean I could have
actually, you know, shot you?

13:59.978 --> 14:01.359
See this?

14:01.873 --> 14:03.737
It's a hollow point!

14:04.006 --> 14:06.698
It makes a teenie little hole going in

14:06.699 --> 14:09.704
but coming out... oh...

14:10.111 --> 14:13.796
it's a big slice of cherry pie!

14:15.262 --> 14:17.267
You know .
Just take it back, sir.

14:17.268 --> 14:20.206
I'm... I'm gonna take
my chances without it.

14:20.207 --> 14:22.102
If that's okay with you.

14:22.198 --> 14:23.712
Well! Hey?

14:23.967 --> 14:28.014
You are such a disappointment to me.

14:28.110 --> 14:31.013
You're gonna be a punk's feast!

14:31.770 --> 14:34.091
Now pack me up.

14:58.253 --> 15:00.418
This is fucking unbelievable!

15:00.865 --> 15:03.337
What other surprises have
you got in store for me?

15:04.218 --> 15:09.474
I recall that you expressed an interest
to look inside the back of my truck.

15:09.475 --> 15:11.729
I bet it's not kosher!

15:12.237 --> 15:14.643
Well, if you pick up the groceries,

15:14.644 --> 15:17.455
- we can take a peek.
- Okay.

15:56.169 --> 15:59.193
Bye bye, Birdy!

16:01.584 --> 16:02.762
Hey, mister?

16:05.333 --> 16:07.216
I'm kind of worried...

16:07.217 --> 16:09.315
that those people back in the bus...

16:09.460 --> 16:11.718
you know, like they
never showed up, right?

16:11.719 --> 16:14.431
I don't know, maybe they're
still in trouble back there!

16:15.779 --> 16:17.668
Ann Marie?

16:21.516 --> 16:23.692
Ann Marie?

16:26.278 --> 16:27.961
Ann Marie?

16:33.622 --> 16:35.230
Ann Marie?

16:38.085 --> 16:39.928
How many times have we seen this?

16:40.213 --> 16:42.767
I know you saw this in...
"Texas Chainsaw".

16:43.309 --> 16:46.747
Both... fucking versions!

16:50.261 --> 16:53.754
Come on, let me take you some place
else until you cut the fucking shit!

16:58.625 --> 17:00.748
I got your credit card, Marie.

17:01.503 --> 17:04.652
So am I trying to abuse
your personal information?

17:05.955 --> 17:07.880
Steal your identity!

17:15.575 --> 17:17.672
There are many cops out here.

17:18.146 --> 17:19.414
Where did you get that?

17:19.415 --> 17:23.337
I mean like, state trooper,
sheriff, that kind of thing...

17:23.338 --> 17:24.428
See this?

17:24.429 --> 17:28.659
There is less than one cruiser
for a 100 square miles up here.

17:28.660 --> 17:31.927
I'm a Deputy Sheriff of Triple Pines.

17:31.928 --> 17:34.511
When I'm not up here, I'm on a job.

17:34.512 --> 17:36.368
I'm just here to...

17:38.065 --> 17:40.317
- Unwind?
- Yeah... Right...

17:40.318 --> 17:42.872
Unwind, that's a good word, unwind.

17:48.876 --> 17:50.909
Oh man, it's weird up here!

17:50.910 --> 17:54.134
Every time you turn around
the corner, it's exactly the same.

17:54.135 --> 17:56.714
You know?  Like as if
you're not getting anywhere.

17:56.715 --> 18:00.369
Well, maybe you not getting anywhere!

18:15.746 --> 18:16.963
Shit!

18:17.021 --> 18:19.246
I'm going in circles!

18:27.680 --> 18:29.015
Do me a favor.

18:29.016 --> 18:32.990
Spare me the part
where I could do anything.

18:42.871 --> 18:44.051
Hey?

18:45.323 --> 18:46.880
Where is everybody?

18:55.237 --> 18:56.713
Where the fuck are they?

18:56.714 --> 18:59.607
That guy from the bus company.
He probably found that van...

18:59.608 --> 19:01.433
- gave him a lift.
- Alright, man...

19:01.434 --> 19:04.146
and then just leave the bus here
with the lights on, the door open?

19:04.147 --> 19:08.109
You know, you're very
dangerously close to having a brain.

19:08.110 --> 19:11.527
Now listen to me.
There was no one here!

19:11.528 --> 19:14.470
So let's not be here either.
I'm bored!

19:14.471 --> 19:16.240
Alright, okay.
Now look!

19:17.665 --> 19:19.915
Right!
See they leave their bags?

19:21.621 --> 19:23.218
Look!
There's Birdy's bag!

19:28.236 --> 19:29.735
Oh my God!

19:30.677 --> 19:33.291
I'm not so bored any more.

19:36.354 --> 19:37.751
This is not good.

19:37.752 --> 19:39.257
This is not good, dude!

19:39.258 --> 19:41.558
We need to haul our ass
back to that restaurant,

19:41.559 --> 19:44.472
or get your CB and
then call the police, man!

19:44.473 --> 19:45.334
What happened to Marie?

19:45.335 --> 19:48.652
I mean what did he do with Marie?
Where the hell is fucking...

19:52.927 --> 19:54.011
There.

19:56.002 --> 19:58.055
Take a closer look.

20:07.414 --> 20:09.376
Marie...

20:13.613 --> 20:14.882
Marie?

20:16.817 --> 20:18.429
Marie?

20:20.093 --> 20:21.755
Hello, Marie!

20:21.856 --> 20:23.373
<i>Please, somebody help me...</i>

20:23.825 --> 20:25.705
I'll find you!

20:27.140 --> 20:29.364
I'm following your voice.

20:31.155 --> 20:33.082
God... Help me!

20:34.527 --> 20:36.143
Please help me!

20:36.216 --> 20:40.088
- Keep shouting, Annie.
- Help me, please!

20:40.089 --> 20:42.617
Please help me!

20:46.707 --> 20:48.628
Help me, please.

20:54.361 --> 20:57.253
What are you doing, just
standing around me?

20:57.595 --> 20:59.178
Who did this?

21:00.275 --> 21:02.290
He ran away.

21:02.395 --> 21:05.346
Describe him, goddammit!

21:05.446 --> 21:07.465
Maybe 25...

21:09.323 --> 21:12.569
...cowboy hat and a duster...

21:12.570 --> 21:16.515
Well, that doesn't sound
like a monster to me, lady!

21:17.394 --> 21:20.319
You want a monster,
I'll give you a monster...

21:21.100 --> 21:23.064
Please help me!

21:23.065 --> 21:25.077
I know you, lady.

21:25.078 --> 21:27.976
At the bus, remember?

21:28.026 --> 21:30.592
I wasn't good enough for you.

21:30.738 --> 21:33.251
You wouldn't get in my truck, would you?

21:33.322 --> 21:37.801
- Where are you going?
- I'm a truck driver not a doctor!

21:37.941 --> 21:42.112
I fucking wouldn't know CPR from **...

21:42.113 --> 21:44.431
Don't leave me here, you bastard!

21:44.432 --> 21:46.577
- You had your chance.
- Come back!

21:47.178 --> 21:49.049
Please!

21:50.344 --> 21:52.708
- Please help me!
- Sorry.  You're not my victim

21:52.709 --> 21:55.041
and I'm nobody here...

22:03.059 --> 22:05.239
About fucking time!

22:16.420 --> 22:17.385
Hey?

22:17.419 --> 22:19.084
I need a room.

22:41.402 --> 22:43.943
- Hi!
- Can we offer you a ride?

22:43.944 --> 22:46.048
Well, don't mind if I do, ma'am.

22:46.318 --> 22:51.128
- Oh wow!  Ma'am.
- Shut up Stoney!

22:51.304 --> 22:53.848
Just being polite, ain't you?

22:53.849 --> 22:55.844
Hey!  How did you wind up
way the fuck out here

22:55.845 --> 22:58.723
in this piss pot in
the middle of nowhere?

22:59.850 --> 23:01.252
Walk!

23:01.253 --> 23:02.921
Like on foot, dude?

23:03.946 --> 23:06.593
Can you just tell us how
far you want to go?

23:06.912 --> 23:08.946
I generally go all the way!

23:11.249 --> 23:12.575
Oops!

23:13.042 --> 23:14.629
Sorry.

23:20.440 --> 23:22.034
Nice pack!

23:23.220 --> 23:25.038
These are my smokes...

23:25.039 --> 23:27.278
And that's my pussy you're showing off!

23:27.279 --> 23:29.186
Just get the fuck in, okay?

23:35.851 --> 23:38.383
I hope you like it bumpy!

24:15.240 --> 24:17.323
Piece of shit motel!

24:28.119 --> 24:30.381
<i>This is the Beach Grove Motel.</i>

24:30.382 --> 24:32.407
<i>We are away from
the desk at the moment...</i>

24:32.420 --> 24:34.456
Are you kidding me!

24:34.457 --> 24:36.187
An answering machine?

24:36.188 --> 24:41.077
I'm in... Yeah, I'm in room 4 and
I just got burnt by my shower...

24:41.078 --> 24:43.663
and I can't turn it off,
the knob came off.

24:43.664 --> 24:46.291
I need a plumber, I need some help...

24:46.847 --> 24:48.366
God dammit!

24:48.367 --> 24:50.881
Even the phone doesn't work!

25:58.762 --> 26:00.613
Look at this!

26:02.917 --> 26:05.751
And the body is still warm!

26:07.174 --> 26:11.777
Someone with the
skill to slice a neck...

26:11.789 --> 26:14.282
without breaking a sweat!

26:14.283 --> 26:16.538
Could have hidden the body.

26:16.757 --> 26:19.658
I don't know... he's got to show off...

26:21.869 --> 26:26.241
What kind of vehicle
would this punk be drivin'?

26:38.837 --> 26:41.121
"Relaxation Service"

26:41.813 --> 26:45.605
Shake it up, shake the bed up!
Shake the bed up.

26:45.788 --> 26:47.709
Do you **?

26:49.242 --> 26:52.425
You know you look a lot better
without all them trashy clothes on.

26:53.147 --> 26:55.445
Without all that trashy skin too.

26:55.683 --> 26:57.765
It's crazy damn!

26:58.999 --> 27:02.297
Snake shed their skin.
It's healthy.

27:07.885 --> 27:09.404
Now that...

27:10.006 --> 27:12.099
I can't fuck a snake either.

27:12.817 --> 27:14.243
Porn...

27:15.267 --> 27:17.538
Embarrassing.

27:20.315 --> 27:22.212
No romance to it.

27:23.173 --> 27:26.942
It's just... kind of clinical, you know?

27:27.790 --> 27:31.565
It's just as meat...
stuck into more meat!

27:32.734 --> 27:34.666
Don't mean nothing, you know?

27:36.638 --> 27:38.538
It's a filling hole.

27:39.787 --> 27:42.913
We can make a hole practically
anywhere, am I right?

27:43.446 --> 27:45.911
Am I... Am I right?

27:46.017 --> 27:48.891
You better sound off like
you got a pair.  Am I right?

27:49.144 --> 27:50.918
I'm sorry!

27:51.808 --> 27:53.699
You can't speak.

27:53.700 --> 27:55.137
You ain't got a mouth.

27:55.138 --> 27:57.052
How you suppose to talk
if you ain't got a mouth?

27:57.939 --> 27:59.504
That's alright.

27:59.505 --> 28:01.195
We gonna make you a mouth.

28:04.304 --> 28:05.950
Hold still.

28:07.769 --> 28:10.919
Pretty mouth, darling.

28:22.652 --> 28:25.458
It's showtime!

28:32.150 --> 28:34.772
Calm down.
It's almost done.

28:35.585 --> 28:36.596
Yeah.

28:36.597 --> 28:38.493
Okay...

29:18.598 --> 29:21.182
Fucking little shit!

29:22.296 --> 29:23.573
Hey?

29:23.574 --> 29:25.635
Keep it down in there!

29:26.660 --> 29:28.610
<i>Shut the fuck up!</i>

29:29.924 --> 29:31.633
Sorry about that!

29:31.874 --> 29:33.872
You should be.

29:47.443 --> 29:49.153
Creepy ass motel!

29:50.753 --> 29:52.719
Creepy...

30:26.233 --> 30:27.755
Come on!

30:28.529 --> 30:31.026
- Fuck!
- No problem.

30:31.027 --> 30:33.119
I got loads of quarters.

30:35.947 --> 30:37.232
Ma'am.

30:38.884 --> 30:40.605
You're welcome?

30:41.720 --> 30:42.993
I'm sorry.
Thank you.

30:43.006 --> 30:45.269
No. That's my pleasure.
That's my pleasure.

30:45.343 --> 30:48.954
- Have you seen the manager anywhere?
- Oh, you mean grandpa?

30:49.083 --> 30:51.464
No, I think he's out getting
his beauty sleep somewhere.

30:51.534 --> 30:53.695
Probably with a bottle,
you know what I mean!

30:54.045 --> 30:55.119
Right...

30:55.740 --> 30:58.829
Anything I can do for you?
I'm real handy!

30:59.813 --> 31:02.066
No...
Thanks though.

31:02.067 --> 31:03.641
Hey, did you hear those two in there?

31:03.654 --> 31:05.590
Sounds like a goddamn rodeo!

31:06.799 --> 31:10.509
Well, I gotta go try to get some sleep.

31:10.639 --> 31:13.315
Alright.
You have yourself a good night.

31:14.884 --> 31:16.565
Hello there...

31:16.639 --> 31:20.272
Oh... excuse me young man.

31:22.272 --> 31:24.671
I hate to pry,

31:24.672 --> 31:28.281
Well, were you by any chance
with this bus full of people

31:28.282 --> 31:30.832
that broke down on
the road to Ganderton?

31:30.955 --> 31:32.511
How did you know that?

31:32.512 --> 31:35.419
I hauled a bunch of them
to the trading post, but...

31:35.872 --> 31:37.830
How did you get away?

31:38.679 --> 31:40.299
I hitchhiked.

31:40.300 --> 31:44.015
How about you, pal?
You a hitchhiker?

31:44.016 --> 31:46.157
No!  Not presently, no sir.

31:46.158 --> 31:47.327
My van right there.

31:47.328 --> 31:50.977
Now, would you fellow
travelers care for a cigarette?

31:52.989 --> 31:55.882
No, sir... I don't indulge.

31:57.224 --> 31:58.853
Miss, please.

32:00.459 --> 32:03.568
Savour the quiet.

32:03.791 --> 32:05.747
Before it starts to rain.

32:08.761 --> 32:10.466
I like the rain.

32:10.968 --> 32:14.453
Rinses the air clean...
Clouds separate...

32:14.789 --> 32:16.533
We can see tons more stars at night.

32:16.534 --> 32:19.783
Well, the rain for me
is just hell on my truck.

32:20.232 --> 32:22.020
Can't argue though, right?

32:22.021 --> 32:25.086
Well, a lot of things can hurt
you out here, you know that?

32:25.722 --> 32:27.344
The woods...

32:27.345 --> 32:29.594
...now they're full of predators.

32:29.595 --> 32:32.108
I gotta go call my boyfriend, now.

32:32.109 --> 32:34.663
Well, I thought you said you were
gonna try and get some sleep.

32:35.306 --> 32:36.960
Yeah... well.

32:36.961 --> 32:40.924
He's gonna be picking me up
real soon, tonight, so...

32:41.337 --> 32:43.020
I'll see ya.

32:44.238 --> 32:45.418
Yup.

32:46.395 --> 32:48.597
So I...

32:48.598 --> 32:52.273
guess it should make you a little jumpy.

32:52.274 --> 32:54.052
Maybe it was you!

32:54.376 --> 32:57.746
It's alright.  First impressions.
Don't mean much.

32:57.747 --> 33:01.954
Oh, so you're a ladies man, am I right?

33:02.680 --> 33:05.152
You'll know what I am eventually.

33:09.719 --> 33:12.316
It's a big truck!
What are you hauling?

33:13.512 --> 33:15.969
- Dog Food.
- Dog Food!

33:17.360 --> 33:20.343
Only I haven't got a full truckload.

33:20.344 --> 33:21.690
Yet.

33:22.114 --> 33:24.110
You'll pick up some more on the way?

33:24.111 --> 33:26.592
Oh yeah.

33:27.514 --> 33:31.764
Well, it's been just
great talking with you.

33:31.765 --> 33:33.677
The pleasure was mine.

33:34.209 --> 33:35.807
I'll see you later.

33:36.649 --> 33:37.979
I bet!

33:38.798 --> 33:41.009
I bet you a quarter.

33:48.109 --> 33:50.618
He bets...

33:55.002 --> 33:56.313
Hey honey.

34:00.857 --> 34:02.598
That was interesting.

34:06.725 --> 34:08.318
I get it.

34:09.589 --> 34:13.185
Trucker bird out there.
Trucker bird out there... He knows!

34:14.263 --> 34:15.811
Don't know how, but he knows.

34:18.103 --> 34:19.810
I didn't do anything.

34:21.900 --> 34:24.176
Because I'm one of them cheetahs.

34:24.522 --> 34:26.723
Yup, like one of them cheetahs...

34:27.172 --> 34:30.661
They'll catch something,
and they don't eat it...

34:31.612 --> 34:33.242
They don't kill it...

34:34.770 --> 34:36.469
They play with it.

34:36.926 --> 34:38.330
You know what I mean?

34:38.341 --> 34:39.675
Sweetie?

34:41.603 --> 34:43.074
I bet you do.

34:51.074 --> 34:53.746
Sanitized.

35:47.676 --> 35:49.182
Goddammit!

37:26.029 --> 37:30.569
Totally unoriginal!
I am ashamed of you!

37:41.593 --> 37:45.752
Ready or not, here I come!

38:28.822 --> 38:30.331
Son of a bitch!

38:30.332 --> 38:31.407
Trucker!

38:54.316 --> 38:57.317
I can't believe I took
a shower in there!

39:41.720 --> 39:43.991
"The Horrible Thing"

39:44.371 --> 39:45.881
What?

39:54.260 --> 39:55.858
Hello, stranger!

39:56.202 --> 39:58.670
Stay back from me.
I've got a knife.

39:58.671 --> 40:00.057
Stay back!

40:00.058 --> 40:04.473
And I got a gun, so I guess I win.

40:04.695 --> 40:09.686
- Listen!  It's me... From the motel!
- What are you doing here?

40:09.687 --> 40:14.763
Well, you know.  What does a guy get
out of a truck to do behind a billboard?

40:15.798 --> 40:18.961
Don't worry.
I'm a cop.

40:19.162 --> 40:21.757
- See?
- Are you sure?

40:22.306 --> 40:25.134
Oh well, says I'm a cop...

40:25.135 --> 40:27.799
It's gonna bucket down here.

40:27.800 --> 40:31.315
Let me give you a lift to Ganderton.
It's on my way.

40:32.504 --> 40:35.519
Listen.
You're not safe out here.

40:36.114 --> 40:37.510
What does that mean?

40:37.511 --> 40:41.615
There are dangerous people out here
and that's why I'm here.

40:41.616 --> 40:44.950
Let's talk about this
where it's dry, okay?

40:45.124 --> 40:48.375
I'll even let you hold my gun...

40:48.376 --> 40:49.970
There.

40:51.538 --> 40:54.314
Fine!  Fuck it!  Let's go.
We're gonna go.  Let's go.

40:55.679 --> 40:57.361
Stay back from me.

40:58.974 --> 41:02.244
I don't need any help
getting into a fucking truck.

41:12.574 --> 41:13.889
Damn!

41:14.187 --> 41:17.836
I'm sorry.  I thought you were
that other guy from the motel.

41:17.837 --> 41:19.907
I think he's following me.

41:20.369 --> 41:22.759
Honey, that's why I'm out here.

41:22.760 --> 41:25.365
What is this?
Some kind of manhunt thing?

41:25.366 --> 41:28.905
- What did he do?
- He hurt a few people.

41:28.906 --> 41:31.355
Do you know about territory?

41:31.456 --> 41:36.430
He's kind of a poacher.
Goes where he doesn't belong...

41:37.336 --> 41:41.114
And he hitchhikes and
that makes him hard to track.

41:41.854 --> 41:44.731
- Jesus!
- Let's get outta here.

41:54.531 --> 41:56.400
What is "The Horrible Thing"?

41:56.401 --> 42:00.857
It's kind of a two headed
baby skeleton, I'd say!

42:01.468 --> 42:03.769
It gives me the creeps.

42:03.770 --> 42:07.575
Baby monsters!
Have you ever seen one?

42:07.758 --> 42:10.236
No.  You're going the wrong way!

42:10.237 --> 42:12.208
Well, well, I...

42:12.304 --> 42:16.987
I want to check this stretch from
here to the motel then turn around

42:16.988 --> 42:20.397
and head out, just to
make sure about this guy.

42:21.345 --> 42:24.284
No ones gonna pick him up in the rain!

42:26.356 --> 42:29.850
- Don't you need backup or something?
- Not just yet.

42:30.609 --> 42:36.577
You probably guess that there's a
personal thing between him and me.

42:38.141 --> 42:39.352
So?

42:39.353 --> 42:41.335
What's your story?

42:41.336 --> 42:45.113
Just trying to get from one place
to the other like everybody else.

42:45.635 --> 42:49.218
Just... like everybody else.

43:04.347 --> 43:06.102
Come on, asshole!

43:07.277 --> 43:09.259
I'm right here!

43:14.305 --> 43:17.684
Wait a second.  If you were after the
guy that was in the room next to me,

43:17.685 --> 43:19.917
why didn't you arrest
him at the hotel?

43:20.827 --> 43:23.193
Well, that's not how it works.

43:23.990 --> 43:25.635
How what works?

43:27.401 --> 43:32.335
Him and me... we're
very, very, very different.

43:32.549 --> 43:39.030
He rides, I drive, he gets
picked up, I do the picking up and

43:39.031 --> 43:41.312
He doesn't have any standards!

43:41.313 --> 43:45.470
And he do anybody.
He's like a mad dog.

43:45.730 --> 43:46.889
So...

43:47.465 --> 43:50.643
It's like you're the hunter
and he is the hunted?

43:50.985 --> 43:56.144
Some hunters only hunt dangerous prey.

43:56.317 --> 43:59.838
Fighters, survivors...
not easy prey.

44:00.005 --> 44:01.975
I don't quite follow you...

44:02.049 --> 44:03.634
I know...

44:04.809 --> 44:09.469
I'll have to show you.  Could you
open that glove compartment for me?

44:09.470 --> 44:12.409
It would all become clear.

44:17.501 --> 44:21.096
Hey jeeze!
That must have hurt!

44:40.237 --> 44:45.795
Ah you know, I'm sorry.  Could have been
Chitty... Chitty Jerry, you know?

44:45.796 --> 44:49.531
- I could have been friendlier instead!
- What the fuck?

44:51.509 --> 44:54.158
What the fuck!
What have you done to me?

44:54.962 --> 44:58.854
And I just said: "Could I have one
of your earrings as a souvenir?"

44:58.855 --> 45:00.714
And you just said no!

45:05.137 --> 45:06.747
- Cool it babe.
- You're gonna let me out!

45:06.748 --> 45:08.200
Borrowed one of your trash!

45:08.235 --> 45:10.704
Oh get it!  Fucking Christ!

45:12.251 --> 45:15.925
Now you will try to... you know
jump out of a running truck?

45:15.926 --> 45:17.858
Which won't do you no good

45:17.859 --> 45:20.588
because the door don't
open from the inside!

45:20.589 --> 45:24.593
- I just thought I'd let you know that.
- Why are you doing this?

45:24.594 --> 45:31.043
Lady, when you're fishing, the bait
doesn't ask stupid questions.

45:31.757 --> 45:35.115
-You're not a cop!
- Hooo yet...

45:35.150 --> 45:38.334
- You piece of shit!
- It's equally stupid!

45:38.911 --> 45:40.973
How long was I out?

45:41.665 --> 45:44.148
10, 15 minutes...

45:44.447 --> 45:46.858
No permanent damage.

46:06.285 --> 46:09.512
- Here we go!
- No, no... no

46:09.988 --> 46:13.037
You don't mind a little company, do you?

46:17.642 --> 46:20.854
- Hell of a night!
- Yeah.

46:21.153 --> 46:22.695
You're offering me a ride?

46:22.696 --> 46:26.548
That's the way it's
suppose to go, isn't it?

46:27.810 --> 46:30.512
You sure you got room?

46:30.747 --> 46:34.640
Yeah, sure.  Get in.

46:45.427 --> 46:47.034
Hello again.

46:54.009 --> 46:55.686
Hold up.  Stop!

46:55.687 --> 46:57.640
- Stop!
- What?

46:58.851 --> 47:00.998
A snake.  Don't hit it.

47:01.549 --> 47:05.220
- Why not?
- Cause it's minding its own business.

47:11.269 --> 47:14.611
- You got another one of those?
- I thought you didn't smoke...

47:14.612 --> 47:16.956
Yeah, well... I guess I fooled you!.

47:16.957 --> 47:20.232
- Here!  Light this up.
- Oh, thank you.

47:21.030 --> 47:25.624
You know, this snake,
reminds me of a blonde joke.

47:25.625 --> 47:28.531
- Do tell.
- This blonde...

47:28.532 --> 47:30.858
she was walking through Central Park

47:30.868 --> 47:35.783
in the middle of winter.  And she sees
this rattlesnake freezing in the snow.

47:35.784 --> 47:38.505
And the rattlesnake says: "Listen, babe,"

47:38.506 --> 47:41.566
in kind of a Humphrey Bogart
way of snake...

47:42.189 --> 47:44.304
I just got out of the Zoo...

47:44.305 --> 47:47.004
Could you pick me up and
take me where it's warm?

47:47.005 --> 47:50.603
She said: No, no.  You'll bite me.
I can't pick you up!

47:50.604 --> 47:52.892
And the snake said
to her, "Do trust me".

47:52.893 --> 47:55.391
And this is the part I love.

47:55.392 --> 47:58.860
She was to be a Girl Scout
for about ten minutes.

47:58.861 --> 48:03.110
She picks the snake up and starts
walking back to the Zoo.

48:03.350 --> 48:06.134
And the snake got up and
bites her right on the boob!

48:06.439 --> 48:09.325
- On the boob?
- Baga big baga boob!

48:09.326 --> 48:11.707
And gives her the big sweep.

48:14.238 --> 48:15.358
Fuck!

48:15.394 --> 48:19.854
She's screaming, "Oh, you
promise not to bite me!"

48:19.855 --> 48:21.284
And the rattlesnake said...

48:21.285 --> 48:24.955
You knew what I was
when you picked me up?

48:26.295 --> 48:29.966
Yes.  Except the way I heard it told,
it was a scorpion and a toad.

48:29.967 --> 48:31.840
Nobody gives a fuck!

48:32.733 --> 48:35.514
You knew the punchline all along, huh?

48:35.515 --> 48:38.972
- Sorry.
- I guess you're just not a dumb blonde.

48:39.372 --> 48:41.671
Yeah, that's good to know.

48:41.672 --> 48:44.194
Alright, should we go?

48:52.099 --> 48:53.758
Where are we going?

48:55.162 --> 48:57.175
Where are you headed, cowboy?

48:58.461 --> 49:01.985
- Where are you taking her?
- Undecided.

49:02.186 --> 49:03.907
Dear God!

49:10.008 --> 49:12.933
- Goodness!
- And wet weather goes in threes.

49:13.778 --> 49:14.978
No...

49:18.856 --> 49:21.337
- Here you are.
- Don't you fucking touch me!

49:21.338 --> 49:23.480
Don't fucking touch me!

49:23.481 --> 49:27.096
- You are a passenger!
- Yeah.  You be polite.

49:27.899 --> 49:30.146
And I just met our trucker friend here.

49:30.315 --> 49:33.008
He is the type of guy who likes to hunt.

49:33.009 --> 49:36.217
He likes to theorize
about prey and he likes...

49:36.514 --> 49:38.940
to think about where the
opponents, and fair game.

49:38.941 --> 49:40.817
Just about all them bullshit.
He loves it.

49:40.924 --> 49:42.734
Very romantic...

49:42.735 --> 49:45.610
Now, he thinks he ain't a predator.

49:46.247 --> 49:48.925
You should have seen
him back at that bus!

49:58.076 --> 50:01.652
See all this little trinkets,
those little souvenirs?

50:02.036 --> 50:04.340
Look at that.
He never saw a horrible thing!

50:04.961 --> 50:07.147
He just kept the button!

50:08.333 --> 50:09.243
Now...

50:09.244 --> 50:12.323
your genuinely dangerous individuals.

50:13.403 --> 50:17.453
They almost never look... crazy.

50:17.458 --> 50:21.115
They don't have any weird tattoos, they
don't have weird stitches on their face,

50:21.116 --> 50:23.219
not funny shape heads.

50:23.564 --> 50:27.239
There are none!

50:28.974 --> 50:30.208
Predictable.

50:30.509 --> 50:34.546
Well, you're within 10 seconds
of making a point there.

50:34.893 --> 50:38.010
Yeah, you drive, he rides
and only question is which

50:38.011 --> 50:40.620
one of you assholes is
the bigger fucking psycho!

50:40.621 --> 50:42.611
I told you to be polite, didn't I?

50:42.612 --> 50:44.579
My bets on the trucker.

50:44.580 --> 50:45.575
Oh, is that right?

50:45.576 --> 50:49.113
You know what?  Why don't you
two assholes just kill each other?

50:49.758 --> 50:52.085
Woh!  Get those guns out of my face!

50:58.091 --> 50:59.838
Your money still on the trucker?

51:00.705 --> 51:03.360
You may get me, but I get her.
You better give it a minute, boss!

51:03.361 --> 51:05.028
Maybe worth it!

51:06.033 --> 51:09.342
Who gets who?

51:09.641 --> 51:11.906
Both of you get fuck!

51:54.116 --> 51:55.607
She's mine!

52:07.021 --> 52:08.515
You can have her!

52:08.661 --> 52:13.920
- After I kill her!
- I ain't some kind of fucking pervert!

52:15.397 --> 52:16.945
She's mine!

52:57.343 --> 52:59.653
No, no, no, no...

53:15.698 --> 53:16.648
Damn!

53:36.118 --> 53:38.375
Never turn down a ride!

53:40.108 --> 53:42.193
That would be crazy!

54:01.913 --> 54:04.196
- Hey! Get your fucking hand...
- Hold still.  Come on, please.

54:04.197 --> 54:06.269
No need to wake yourself up!

54:07.043 --> 54:08.811
You know, you were goddamn lucky!

54:08.812 --> 54:09.843
What do you mean?

54:09.844 --> 54:12.965
I went through the a fucking
windshield and you call me fucking lucky?

54:13.169 --> 54:17.122
No, you lost yourself some blood and
you broke your arm and your leg,

54:17.123 --> 54:20.419
I guess I should mind my own
business about this, huh?

54:23.924 --> 54:26.588
Man, I had an accident!

54:27.805 --> 54:32.068
Yeah, I through the windshield
and I'm innocent of anything.

54:32.069 --> 54:35.252
And don't think about
the bumps in the road, okay?

54:36.533 --> 54:37.851
Here, have this.

54:40.029 --> 54:41.231
Oh no...

54:44.436 --> 54:47.972
- You...
- Three!  Is always beat you, right.

54:49.735 --> 54:52.729
You beat me, you fucking **!

54:53.215 --> 54:56.661
- You are fucking dead!
- Fuck you!

54:58.921 --> 55:00.899
Calm the fuck down!

55:03.220 --> 55:05.968
Fuck you piece of shit!

55:06.384 --> 55:09.572
Well, we have a 200
year old truck driver!

55:11.426 --> 55:13.296
Gentlemen, please.
Take it easy.

55:14.944 --> 55:16.511
Calm down.

55:18.289 --> 55:21.837
You don't bust a blood vessel,
you stupid son-of-a-bitch.

55:25.068 --> 55:29.487
There's a hell of a lot
two guys like us can do!

55:29.891 --> 55:32.214
In an ambulance like this.

55:34.795 --> 55:36.326
Okay, boys and girls!

55:36.527 --> 55:39.065
Seat belts fasten and luggage stowed.

55:40.633 --> 55:43.386
Hey, Benny.  Watch this!
Two at once.

55:43.387 --> 55:46.378
- What's in those?
- Oh, nothing but air, my friend!

55:53.230 --> 55:54.737
Awesome!

56:01.005 --> 56:03.578
Hey Bobby?
What about dessert?

56:04.176 --> 56:06.156
Oh! Oh!

56:06.488 --> 56:09.303
We're saving her for later!
