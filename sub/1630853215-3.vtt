00:12.600 --> 00:15.760
You cannot put a price
on the power of creativity.

00:16.440 --> 00:20.080
Creativity leads to productivity,
which leads to self-esteem,

00:20.160 --> 00:23.160
which leads to inmates
being less likely to re-offend.

00:23.240 --> 00:27.560
So, I've invested in a job-lot
of modeling clay.

00:27.640 --> 00:29.840
-As all good governors should.
-<i>Danke.</i>

00:29.920 --> 00:32.040
But it's gone missing, hasn't it?
All that clay.

00:32.120 --> 00:34.320
Some clay has gone missing. Yeah.

00:35.160 --> 00:36.520
I see that as a win.

00:37.159 --> 00:40.320
Youse don't takes what youse don't likes.

00:40.400 --> 00:44.400
Unless, of course, you're in a prison full
of thieves who will nick any old shit.

00:52.720 --> 00:55.360
This-- This is Sebastian.

00:56.120 --> 00:57.320
This is Sebastian.

00:57.400 --> 01:00.240
He's one of those people
that writes to women in prison.

01:00.320 --> 01:02.600
Thinks everyone behind bars needs saving.

01:02.680 --> 01:04.520
You know the sort.

01:05.120 --> 01:08.480
The sort that could easily
get taken advantage of financially.

01:09.120 --> 01:11.280
And, unfortunately,
that's what's happened.

01:11.360 --> 01:14.720
'Cause when I said to him,
"Will you save up money for a camper van,

01:14.800 --> 01:18.240
top-of-the-range camper van, so that
when I'm out we can go traveling?"

01:18.320 --> 01:19.720
I didn't mean him and me.

01:20.360 --> 01:21.920
I meant me and my mammy.

01:22.600 --> 01:24.200
We're going on a road trip.

01:24.280 --> 01:26.600
The road trip of our lives.

01:26.680 --> 01:28.280
Road trip!

01:29.120 --> 01:30.880
Sebastian's not coming.

01:31.880 --> 01:33.360
You're not invited.

01:33.440 --> 01:35.040
Don't tell him.

01:35.120 --> 01:38.160
But you know what, love,
it makes us do strange things.

01:38.920 --> 01:40.760
And he fell in love with this.

01:41.720 --> 01:45.160
Well, actually he fell in love with this.

01:49.080 --> 01:50.160
That's me.

01:52.400 --> 01:53.960
My hair was longer.

02:03.520 --> 02:05.760
-You had that?

02:05.840 --> 02:07.480
You wouldn't get that in Essex.

02:07.560 --> 02:08.920
Not even on the men.

02:15.240 --> 02:17.560
<i>As if clay wasn't enough</i>
<i>to be getting on with,</i>

02:17.640 --> 02:21.960
<i>she's now introduced an open-door policy.</i>
<i>"Anyone. Anything. Anytime."</i>

02:22.680 --> 02:25.920
Which is Latin for, "I'm dreadfully inept,
but please like me."

02:26.600 --> 02:28.520
-Knock, knock.
-Who's there?

02:28.600 --> 02:30.760
Oh, it's not the beginning of a joke,

02:30.840 --> 02:32.720
I just didn't know
if I could walk straight in.

02:32.800 --> 02:38.240
Yes, yes, I'm available to all
of my inmates. Anyone, anything, anytime.

02:38.320 --> 02:39.320
Sound.

02:39.400 --> 02:41.760
So, I was just wondering,
as it's visiting day,

02:41.840 --> 02:43.280
do I have any visitors?

02:43.360 --> 02:45.240
Well, let us have a look.

02:46.120 --> 02:47.120
Uh…

02:47.840 --> 02:48.840
Ros, you do.

02:48.920 --> 02:52.000
Is it my mammy? It's my mammy, isn't it?

02:59.520 --> 03:00.800
It's Sebastian.

03:00.880 --> 03:03.320
Oh, right, grand.

03:06.480 --> 03:08.440
It doesn't have the same vibe, does it?

03:09.200 --> 03:12.040
I'm sorry, Ros. Maybe she'll come soon.

03:12.120 --> 03:13.480
Oh, yeah, yeah.

03:13.560 --> 03:16.280
Yeah, she's definitely
going to come soon. Come on.

03:20.280 --> 03:21.720
Poor Ros.

03:32.360 --> 03:37.360
First day of rehearsals
for all my little musical boos.

03:37.440 --> 03:39.080
Exciting, ain't it?

03:39.160 --> 03:42.200
-Exciting!
-I do feel nervous.

03:42.280 --> 03:44.000
I've got a new business!

03:44.080 --> 03:45.680
What's your new business?

03:45.760 --> 03:48.040
I put on musicals at the airport.

03:48.120 --> 03:49.560
How's business?

03:49.640 --> 03:51.240
It's a runway success.

03:52.640 --> 03:55.640
Runaway. Runaway success, as in "runway."

03:55.720 --> 03:56.920
No?

03:57.000 --> 03:58.120
Nah.

03:58.200 --> 04:01.680
I got down to the last 32 on <i>Love Island</i> .
I've got nothing to prove.

04:02.400 --> 04:04.440
Laura, we've got an idea.

04:04.520 --> 04:07.760
Great. Anyone, anything, anytime.

04:07.840 --> 04:10.160
We want to talk to you
about competitive rolling.

04:10.240 --> 04:12.120
-Shall we talk about your idea first?
-That is our idea.

04:12.200 --> 04:13.160
Excellent.

04:13.240 --> 04:15.320
We could put Woldsley on the map.

04:15.400 --> 04:18.680
Make it a center of athletic excellence.
Go on, Madge, show her what you do.

04:25.760 --> 04:26.760
Mm-hmm.

04:26.839 --> 04:28.360
Now do it backwards.

04:29.800 --> 04:32.320
We could start a league. Do doubles.

04:32.400 --> 04:35.480
Or what's that thing they do
when all those swimmers do it together?

04:35.560 --> 04:37.280
-Synchronized.
-Come on, Jean.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.480
Show her what you got.

04:42.440 --> 04:43.640
Go.

04:46.120 --> 04:48.280
-Oh. Oh!

04:48.360 --> 04:51.640
We'd wear proper kit and all.

04:51.720 --> 04:53.280
-Hi. Hello.
-Hello.

04:53.360 --> 04:55.320
Can you take your jacket off, please?

04:55.400 --> 04:57.200
-Step through.

04:58.400 --> 04:59.240
Go over there.

05:01.440 --> 05:02.600
Nice.

05:03.280 --> 05:05.240
You have yourself a nice day, okay?

05:08.560 --> 05:12.000
In person, Rosalind looks
very different from her photo.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.920
Can you believe this was taken
on the day she arrived in prison?

05:17.600 --> 05:19.840
The experience has ravaged her.

05:20.520 --> 05:21.960
But she will be out soon.

05:22.040 --> 05:24.800
And we will be driving along the road
to redemption

05:24.880 --> 05:31.160
in our new recreational vehicle Volkswagen
California Coast 2.0 TDI.

05:31.240 --> 05:33.960
That I will have paid for
but registered in her name.

05:35.040 --> 05:40.200
And with God's love and determination,
she will get back to looking like this.

05:41.200 --> 05:42.280
Yes.

05:46.760 --> 05:48.280
I hear you're playing Maria.

05:48.960 --> 05:50.480
You must have a good voice.

05:52.040 --> 05:53.960
<i>West Side Story.</i>

05:54.800 --> 05:56.080
It was my idea, you know.

05:56.160 --> 05:57.280
Of course it was.

05:57.360 --> 05:58.600
Like the clay.

05:58.680 --> 06:01.760
Oh, give it a rest, Dean.
What don't you get?

06:01.840 --> 06:04.760
The more deposits you put
into the bank of creativity,

06:04.840 --> 06:08.720
the greater the interest
is on the balance of rewards

06:08.800 --> 06:11.960
when you come to withdraw
the deposits of creativity

06:12.040 --> 06:13.920
from the previously saved bank…

06:14.720 --> 06:15.720
account.

06:15.800 --> 06:18.000
You might want to tighten that up
before your TED Talk.

06:18.080 --> 06:21.200
-Because that, it didn't make sense.
-Mm. Clay makes sense. Oh…

06:23.760 --> 06:25.960
How are your ankles?

06:26.040 --> 06:28.160
-What?
-They get big, don't they?

06:28.760 --> 06:31.240
Balloon up. Big, puffy, balloon ankles.

06:31.320 --> 06:33.960
I mean, that's why I thought
you'd be better off working in here

06:34.040 --> 06:36.760
instead of in the laundry.
Less time on your big, balloon ankles.

06:38.400 --> 06:39.960
What's it like being pregnant?

06:40.640 --> 06:43.120
I used to put a cushion up my jumper
to see what it felt like.

06:43.200 --> 06:44.760
-Does it feel like that?
-Again, what?

06:44.840 --> 06:46.520
I don't have kids.

06:46.600 --> 06:48.240
A conscious decision.

06:48.320 --> 06:50.120
Too demanding. Too restrictive.

06:50.200 --> 06:53.080
-Too late now.
-No. No, it's not. Nicole Kidman, 41.

06:53.160 --> 06:57.880
Gwen Stefani, 44. Geena Davis, twins, 48.
So, still plenty of time.

06:57.960 --> 06:59.760
I didn't realize this job
would involve so much chat.

06:59.840 --> 07:03.240
Hmm. Noted. I will try to rein that in.

07:08.360 --> 07:10.360
She didn't have to give you this job,
you know?

07:17.160 --> 07:19.160
<i>Was it nice of her</i>
<i>to give me a desk job?</i>

07:19.240 --> 07:22.680
Was it nice of her
to talk about my puffy ankles?

07:22.760 --> 07:26.160
I mean, this is going on the telly.
What a prick!

07:33.440 --> 07:36.240
I prefer doing this
than be out there working, don't you?

07:36.320 --> 07:38.720
-<i>I love my job.</i>

07:39.360 --> 07:43.680
<i>You get to come in and make a connection</i>
<i>with all these women during their stay.</i>

07:43.760 --> 07:45.560
<i>It's the stuff of life, is that.</i>

07:45.640 --> 07:48.800
<i>Oh, yeah,</i>
<i>it's life's rich tapestry in here, innit?</i>

07:48.880 --> 07:51.760
<i>Plus, you never know</i>
<i>who's coming through them doors.</i>

07:51.840 --> 07:54.000
<i>Oh, you having that one, Gal.</i>

07:54.720 --> 07:56.480
-Eh?

07:59.640 --> 08:01.920
Right, what's going on?
Come on, tell me everything.

08:02.760 --> 08:06.080
-I always find visiting days hard.
-Why, 'cause we get a shorter lunch break?

08:06.160 --> 08:08.280
I'm not here for me. I'm here for them.

08:08.360 --> 08:12.520
That's why I took this job.
To give something back. Make a difference.

08:12.600 --> 08:16.000
I took this job because I can get to work
without changing tubes.

08:17.120 --> 08:18.960
Are they treating you all right?

08:19.480 --> 08:21.040
Do you want some food?

08:28.360 --> 08:30.440
Oh, you trying something new there, Fi?

08:30.520 --> 08:33.760
We all struggle with blending, but just
remember, highlight is not a weapon.

08:33.840 --> 08:34.960
-Fuck off.

08:35.040 --> 08:38.799
Don't know what you're in here for, boo,
but that contouring's criminal.

08:39.679 --> 08:40.679
Oh.

08:41.280 --> 08:43.000
That's not one of my best lines.

08:46.679 --> 08:47.679
No visitors?

08:47.760 --> 08:50.960
Oh, yeah, but I've asked them to wait
until I've filed these.

08:51.040 --> 08:53.320
-Oh, you don't have to do that.
-That was a joke.

08:54.120 --> 08:56.280
-Because you don't have any visitors.
-Yeah.

08:57.160 --> 08:58.160
Yeah.

09:01.160 --> 09:02.920
-Want to do a TikTok?
-What?

09:03.000 --> 09:05.400
-TikTok. We could do a TikTok.
-No.

09:05.480 --> 09:07.440
-Sure?
-I'll do a TikTok with you.

09:07.520 --> 09:10.040
'Cause that sounds like a great use
of everyone's time.

09:47.640 --> 09:51.400
You make me so happy, Rosalind.
I'm so proud of you.

09:51.480 --> 09:55.400
I'm counting down the days
until you are free, and it's not long now.

09:57.240 --> 09:59.520
I cannot wait to show you off
to my family.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.480
They are going to love you as I do.

10:01.560 --> 10:04.200
Mama Dede and Auntie Nala pray every night

10:04.280 --> 10:07.080
for the continued redemption
of your wicked soul.

10:07.160 --> 10:10.760
I said to them, respectfully,
"She does not need your prayers.

10:10.840 --> 10:14.800
I have looked into her eyes
and I see the purest of all souls.

10:14.880 --> 10:18.320
And I know with all my heart
that she can do no wrong."

10:23.040 --> 10:26.880
Hey, Mr. Tom Jones,
you are big in Africa, do you know?

10:26.960 --> 10:27.960
Thank you.

10:29.440 --> 10:32.760
I do feel bad about
taking advantage of Sebastian,

10:32.840 --> 10:37.200
because, uh, well, yeah,
it's theft, basically.

10:37.760 --> 10:40.120
But, in my defense, I am a criminal.

10:40.200 --> 10:41.440
And he knew that.

10:41.520 --> 10:44.200
So, it's on him, really.

10:44.280 --> 10:47.080
It's not like I tried to pretend
to be anything I'm not.

10:48.440 --> 10:49.680
Apart from that.

10:53.960 --> 10:55.080
You had that?

10:55.160 --> 10:59.760
Pretend Parker Bowles is married
to a Tom Jones lookalikey in real life.

11:00.680 --> 11:02.080
What?

11:02.160 --> 11:04.360
It's not unusual.

11:05.960 --> 11:09.360
Now that is one of my best lines.

11:09.440 --> 11:12.440
He's laughing already.
Don't leave me hanging, Gal.

11:14.480 --> 11:16.320
Bye!

11:33.240 --> 11:35.400
-Let's be having you.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.360
Laura came good on her word.

11:41.040 --> 11:42.680
And I've got a new cellmate.

11:42.760 --> 11:45.840
Please, Anastasia, it is my baseball cap.

11:45.920 --> 11:47.440
No, this is my baseball cap.

11:47.520 --> 11:49.240
My kids gave me that cap.

11:49.320 --> 11:51.040
My uncle gave me this cap.

11:51.120 --> 11:53.040
Please, Anastasia.

11:53.120 --> 11:57.760
What a shame you lost your cap.
If I find it, I'll let you know.

12:00.840 --> 12:04.920
Actually, on second thought,
I will have a go of this singing lark.

12:05.720 --> 12:08.360
-Oh, we've got a new addition.
-Yeah.

12:10.760 --> 12:13.720
Who's in the house? She's in the house.
My mammy's in the house.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.520
My mammy's in the house--

12:15.600 --> 12:17.640
Have you read that email
from the board yet?

12:17.720 --> 12:19.680
-I chose not to.
-On what basis?

12:19.760 --> 12:21.840
On the basis, they have a tendency lately

12:21.920 --> 12:24.280
to be very negative
and extremely personal.

12:24.360 --> 12:26.880
It's understandable.
Leading from the front, again.

12:26.960 --> 12:29.320
When in doubt, ignore, ignore, ignore.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.400
Can't hear you,
can't hear you, can't hear you.

12:31.480 --> 12:32.840
This one might be worth a look.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.320
-No, thank you.
-Laura.

12:35.160 --> 12:36.400
Read the email.

12:42.600 --> 12:43.600
Hmm.

12:47.800 --> 12:49.000
Oh, no.

12:51.880 --> 12:53.760
Oh, fuck.

12:59.440 --> 13:01.600
So some of the girls
I haven't met yet, but--

13:01.680 --> 13:05.240
Cheryl, the cast list said I was ensemble,

13:05.320 --> 13:08.200
which is incorrect, I'm playing Bernard-O.

13:08.280 --> 13:09.400
Uh, you mean Bernardo?

13:09.480 --> 13:13.880
Yes, Bernard-O. And I've highlighted
my script using a highlighter.

13:16.800 --> 13:18.480
All right, girls.

13:18.560 --> 13:21.120
Uh, most of you know Martin,
our musical maestro,

13:21.200 --> 13:23.920
and, uh, this is Tom…
…our dance captain.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.160
He'll be putting you through your paces.

13:26.240 --> 13:28.600
-Right, who's up for a sing song?

13:28.680 --> 13:32.360
Ah, ah, ah. A few house rules.
No drill, no jazz, no folk.

13:52.360 --> 13:53.360
Meow.

14:02.680 --> 14:05.840
No wonder Daddy wouldn't buy her
a bow-wow. Thing's got rabies.

14:05.920 --> 14:08.880
-Cheryl, do you have a minute?
-Mm.

14:11.160 --> 14:12.480
Change of plan.

14:12.560 --> 14:15.000
We've been refused the rights
to <i>West Side Story</i> .

14:15.080 --> 14:16.640
-What?
-I just read the email.

14:16.720 --> 14:18.000
That's a bit late in the day.

14:18.080 --> 14:20.960
Actually, it's a bit late in the week,
because they sent it Monday.

14:21.040 --> 14:22.880
I put off reading it, which I now regret.

14:22.960 --> 14:24.440
What are we going to do?

14:24.520 --> 14:28.200
Well, unless anyone has an in with
Andrew Lloyd Webber…

14:28.280 --> 14:29.480
-Do you?
-No.

14:29.560 --> 14:33.200
Then could we make up our own one?

14:33.280 --> 14:36.240
-What? Make up our own musical?
-If you think that's a possibility.

14:36.320 --> 14:38.600
-I don't.
-Well, I do.

14:38.680 --> 14:42.360
Because I have faith in you,
and I have faith in these women.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.640
What an opportunity.

14:46.600 --> 14:50.200
I mean, thinking about it,
it's actually better this way.

14:52.480 --> 14:55.680
Break a leg, everyone!
That just means good luck, Vivian.

14:56.480 --> 14:59.680
I could hardly sleep, I was that excited.
It's a great thing you've done here.

14:59.760 --> 15:01.560
I don't know what you're saying.
Nobody does.

15:03.560 --> 15:06.000
Look, we've got to try.

15:06.080 --> 15:09.920
I can't pull the rug from under their
creative feet now. It's too important.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.480
They're already invested.

15:12.040 --> 15:13.880
Plus, I've had a grant
from the government,

15:13.960 --> 15:17.000
and everyone's expecting a full-blown
production in just under a month.

15:17.080 --> 15:19.400
Please don't film me from behind!

15:22.120 --> 15:23.760
I know you're still doing it.

15:34.640 --> 15:35.640
Yeah.

15:35.720 --> 15:37.840
You'll do.

15:37.920 --> 15:38.960
What?

15:41.080 --> 15:43.600
Pride in the way I look.
What's the matter with that?

15:43.680 --> 15:44.880
It's wasted in here.

15:48.480 --> 15:51.680
So, shame about your <i>West Side Story</i> .
That's got to be a blow.

15:51.760 --> 15:54.920
Yes, well, it is surprisingly difficult
to get permission to do musicals.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.080
I've heard that.
Plus, they probably caught wind

15:57.160 --> 16:00.520
of last year's <i>Fiddler on the Roof</i> scandal
and thought, "Not a chance in hell."

16:00.600 --> 16:03.480
It was a talent show.
The point of putting on a talent show

16:03.560 --> 16:05.280
is to show people's talents.

16:05.360 --> 16:06.360
Hey!

16:06.920 --> 16:10.080
However, we have all learned a lot
from our diversity training since then.

16:10.160 --> 16:14.000
-Oh, for goodness sake, Doug! Every time.

16:14.080 --> 16:16.280
Have you found the clay yet?

16:16.360 --> 16:18.440
-No.
-I don't think he knows about the clay.

16:18.520 --> 16:22.160
Doug, a lot of clay has gone missing,
so could you find that, please?

16:22.800 --> 16:23.880
Yep!

16:25.680 --> 16:28.960
-I love Doug.
-Oh, yeah. He da man.

16:31.440 --> 16:35.080
I'm sorry I haven't got better news,
ladies. But it is what it is.

16:35.160 --> 16:37.680
So what's that mean?
We're not doing <i>West Side Story</i> ?

16:37.760 --> 16:40.600
-But we started learning the songs.
-I learned-- I learned 'em.

16:40.680 --> 16:42.760
We were going to be Sharks.
Puerto Rican Sharks.

16:42.840 --> 16:45.040
-Mm-hmm.
-We were looking forward to that.

16:45.120 --> 16:47.680
Sorry, we can't use any of it.
Songs or script.

16:47.760 --> 16:49.800
Well, can't we do another musical instead?

16:49.880 --> 16:51.440
<i>Lion King</i> !

16:51.520 --> 16:53.880
Too late now.
We won't get permission in time.

16:53.960 --> 16:55.480
So, what are we going to do?

16:55.560 --> 16:57.440
Current thinking
is that we'd write our own one.

16:57.520 --> 16:59.880
-Write our own musical? Fuck off.
-Hear, hear.

16:59.960 --> 17:02.080
See, I knew this would be a waste of time.

17:02.160 --> 17:04.400
-Fuck off on writing our own musical.
-For real.

17:04.480 --> 17:06.560
Let's not give up on ourselves so easily.

17:06.640 --> 17:09.280
We throw away this opportunity,
we throw away our power.

17:09.359 --> 17:10.240
Mm-hmm.

17:10.319 --> 17:14.720
We're strong, proud women,
and we deserve to be heard!

17:14.800 --> 17:16.720
-True.
-We've got everything we need.

17:16.800 --> 17:18.680
-We've got each other.
-We've got each other.

17:18.760 --> 17:21.200
I reckon I'd be pretty good
at writing songs, as it goes.

17:21.280 --> 17:24.640
Come on! This is supposed to be about us
taking back our narrative, anyway.

17:24.720 --> 17:25.599
Right there.

17:25.680 --> 17:27.920
We've got our own stories, haven't we?

17:29.760 --> 17:31.319
Oh God, here we go.

17:39.160 --> 17:40.520
Satiric.

17:41.320 --> 17:44.120
That's really hard, to find something
that rhymes with lyrics.

17:45.600 --> 17:47.920
We certainly do have our own stories.

17:48.000 --> 17:52.400
She's here because one day she fought back
against a lifetime of domestic abuse.

17:52.480 --> 17:56.280
And she's here because she made
a stand against global warming.

17:56.360 --> 17:58.480
Our stories are very different.

17:58.560 --> 18:02.400
I often say,
"They had to lock me up to set me free."

18:02.480 --> 18:06.640
And much to my surprise,
after 17 happy years of marriage,

18:06.720 --> 18:08.000
I feel the same.

18:11.080 --> 18:13.840
Heather, I don't know if you know,
but we're gay for the stay.

18:13.920 --> 18:15.920
-We're not.
-Could we work with that?

18:16.000 --> 18:18.160
-It already rhymes.
-What are we going to call it?

18:18.240 --> 18:20.960
All right, Martine, jump on your keyboard
and do us some chords.

18:21.040 --> 18:23.200
-Oh, yeah, come on, Martine.

18:23.280 --> 18:25.040
-Charlee's got the voice.

18:25.120 --> 18:28.720
I've got the moves.
Hey, come on, let's do it!

18:28.800 --> 18:31.440
What about <i>Songs From The Inside</i> ?

18:31.520 --> 18:34.240
-That's amazing.

18:56.240 --> 18:57.640
Oh, my God, that rhymed.

18:57.720 --> 18:59.200
I'm really good at this.

18:59.280 --> 19:01.080
-I just got chills.

19:02.560 --> 19:05.280
So what's the sitch with Bernard-O?

19:07.840 --> 19:09.480
What rhymes with "hat"?

19:09.560 --> 19:10.560
Bat.

19:10.640 --> 19:11.920
Yes.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.760
Wait, do you mean, like,
the cricket one or the Halloween one?

19:14.840 --> 19:18.000
Probably the cricket one.
But I think either could work.

19:18.680 --> 19:21.320
Actually, no, definitely the cricket one.

19:21.400 --> 19:22.520
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

19:22.600 --> 19:24.560
And then, she said, "Synchronized,"

19:24.640 --> 19:27.600
and I get down on the floor
and start rolling round with Gormless.

19:29.320 --> 19:31.360
But I'll tell you what,
her open-door policy

19:31.440 --> 19:34.320
isn't as good as her open-bag policy,
because we got this.

19:37.800 --> 19:38.800
Powder.

19:38.880 --> 19:40.720
-Can I have some?
-Is there any lipstick?

19:40.800 --> 19:43.600
-What about that one?
-Oh, do you like that?

19:43.680 --> 19:44.640
-I love that.
-Ooh.

19:44.720 --> 19:46.920
-Who wants a pencil?
-Me.

19:51.240 --> 19:54.440
I've had some fantastic news
from my solicitor.

19:54.520 --> 19:57.320
I don't want to speak too soon
or jinx anything,

19:57.400 --> 20:00.480
but it's looking likely
that my trial will get thrown out.

20:02.400 --> 20:05.920
But if I've got any chance
of surviving while I'm in here,

20:06.000 --> 20:08.680
I've got to learn how to stand my ground.

20:08.760 --> 20:11.360
Some of the girls said
that they're going to help me out.

20:11.440 --> 20:15.160
You know, just with swearing and insults.
That sort of thing.

20:15.240 --> 20:17.360
Ros has even started calling me "Flange."

20:18.680 --> 20:21.640
<i>I hope that catches on,</i>
<i>because that would give me some real cred.</i>

20:21.720 --> 20:23.960
You're nothing in here without a nickname.

20:24.040 --> 20:28.080
No Hat Cathy, she said she's going
to help me find my prison walk.

20:28.160 --> 20:30.680
Apparently, if you bounce more
on the balls of your feet

20:30.760 --> 20:32.800
you're less likely to be easy prey.

20:49.400 --> 20:50.680
-Yeah, that's it.
-Or…

20:54.000 --> 20:55.280
Ooh!

20:55.360 --> 20:58.080
-You've landed on your feet again.

20:58.160 --> 21:01.280
Word's got around they're really enjoying
writing their own musical.

21:01.360 --> 21:03.800
Are they? Thank God for that.

21:04.480 --> 21:06.920
-Whew! That's a relief.
-I bet it is.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.600
-And they've already given it a name.
-Have they?

21:09.680 --> 21:12.120
-What's it called?
-<i>Songs From The Inside</i> .

21:12.200 --> 21:15.440
Well, that is brilliant.

21:15.520 --> 21:19.040
Because "inside," meaning prison,

21:19.120 --> 21:21.920
and also "inside," meaning of themselves.

21:22.640 --> 21:24.800
And that is all down
to my leadership skills.

21:24.880 --> 21:27.640
Well, A, no it isn't,
because, B, you haven't got any.

21:27.720 --> 21:30.640
Mmm. It's not about making
the right decision, Dean,

21:30.720 --> 21:33.240
it's about making the decision right.

21:33.320 --> 21:35.800
And I've made the decision
that doesn't make any sense.

21:35.880 --> 21:37.920
At the end of the day,
it's all about communication.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.120
Communication and listening.

21:39.200 --> 21:41.240
Which one is it?
Communication or listening.

21:41.320 --> 21:44.760
Listening. Just give people the chance
to be heard and let them do the rest.

21:45.760 --> 21:47.440
She's got an idea
but she don't want to say.

21:47.520 --> 21:51.000
-You'll think it's stupid.
-There are no stupid ideas.

21:51.080 --> 21:52.320
Not here, not with me.

21:52.400 --> 21:55.120
The stupid thing would be to say nothing,

21:55.200 --> 21:58.040
then we could all miss out
on a great idea. How about that?

21:58.120 --> 21:59.120
All right.

21:59.200 --> 22:01.640
Well, I was thinking we could
get a load of cats in here,

22:01.720 --> 22:03.400
so that everyone's got their own cat.

22:03.480 --> 22:05.880
Maybe two or three each,
because cats are nice.

22:05.960 --> 22:08.160
-Yeah, tell her about the milk.
-Yeah.

22:08.240 --> 22:12.280
We could milk 'em,
use their milk to save on the milk bill,

22:12.360 --> 22:15.280
which could make us
carbon neutral. Win-win.

22:17.160 --> 22:19.280
-Leave it with you, then?
-Okey-dokes.

22:22.680 --> 22:26.000
Yeah, I think it's about time
to draw a line under the open-door policy.

22:26.080 --> 22:28.440
What, you're not going to run
with the cat idea? Why?

22:28.520 --> 22:30.800
-Fuck you.
-The savings alone are a no-brainer.

22:30.880 --> 22:31.880
Fuck you twice.

22:31.960 --> 22:34.160
-I think I found your clay.
-Oh.

22:34.760 --> 22:35.960
What's that noise?

22:36.800 --> 22:37.800
You hear that?

22:38.440 --> 22:40.960
Is that the sound of me
landing on my feet again?

22:41.040 --> 22:44.480
Yes, it is. Oh, she's on fire.

22:44.560 --> 22:45.680
I wish you were.

22:47.720 --> 22:49.960
-Dear God.
-Yep.

22:50.040 --> 22:52.560
-Are these what I think they are?
-Yep.

22:52.640 --> 22:54.800
-What do you think they are?
-I found 12 boxes.

22:54.880 --> 22:56.760
Does that account
for all the missing clay?

22:56.840 --> 22:59.360
No, I guess that some are already…

22:59.440 --> 23:00.840
In circulation?

23:00.920 --> 23:03.720
I mean, what are they thinking.
They're not even glazed.

23:03.800 --> 23:05.960
Oh, this one looks glazed.

23:07.160 --> 23:08.960
I'm not sure that's glazing.

23:36.480 --> 23:39.880
<i>Some of the women ended up</i>
<i>in hospital with toxic shock,</i>

23:39.960 --> 23:43.400
<i>which was a shame, but not surprising.</i>

23:43.480 --> 23:46.160
<i>I just wish it wasn't always so hard.</i>

23:46.240 --> 23:47.280
<i>No pun intended.</i>

23:47.360 --> 23:50.880
I am the custodian of these women's lives
while they're here.

23:50.960 --> 23:53.640
It's supposed to be difficult.
I'm up for the challenge.

23:53.720 --> 23:57.560
I just would like one day
where things go my way.

23:57.640 --> 23:59.680
It doesn't even have to be a full day.

24:06.680 --> 24:09.240
-I'm not moving.
-You go, Flange.

24:10.120 --> 24:11.840
So take your big feet somewhere else.

24:11.920 --> 24:13.840
Yeah!

24:14.800 --> 24:17.400
-Go on, move in there, you do it.
-Go on then!

24:17.960 --> 24:19.520
-Fa--
-Come on…

24:19.600 --> 24:20.600
Fatso.

24:23.160 --> 24:24.160
Sorry, Pat.

24:24.240 --> 24:25.800
Don't apologize!

24:26.760 --> 24:28.920
That's right. That's right. That's right.

24:29.960 --> 24:33.360
And your hair is shit.
