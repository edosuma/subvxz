00:02.160 --> 00:04.003
BARRY: This season on The Flash...

00:04.200 --> 00:06.601
I went back in time
and created an alternate timeline,

00:06.800 --> 00:08.086
<i>a whole new existence.</i>

00:08.320 --> 00:10.482
<i>I created Flashpoint
and changed everything.</i>

00:10.680 --> 00:13.490
- Who are you?
-Savitar, the god of speed.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.205
You said that I trapped you
in the future. Where?

00:15.400 --> 00:18.085
The only place that could hold me,
the Speed Force.

00:18.280 --> 00:20.442
-Iris West, will you marry me?
-Yes.

00:20.640 --> 00:24.087
Dr. Brand invents the technology
that traps Savitar in the Speed Force.

00:24.280 --> 00:25.850
- Good luck with that.
- CISCO: We <i>don't</i> want to <i>fight</i> you.

00:26.080 --> 00:27.445
We're your friends, your family.

00:27.640 --> 00:29.483
- Caitlin, I love you.
-I never loved any of you.

00:29.680 --> 00:30.966
<i>CISCO: Caitlin's working with Savitar.</i>

00:31.160 --> 00:33.322
<i>FROST: Caitlin is dead.
CISCO: Not to me.</i>

00:34.520 --> 00:37.649
- BARRY: <i>I</i> know who you are.
- I am the Future Flash.

00:37.840 --> 00:40.047
<i>When I have control of all of time,</i>

00:40.240 --> 00:43.130
it will be you
who is abandoned and forgotten.

00:43.320 --> 00:47.689
And I only need for Iris to die, so that
you are driven so far into the dark

00:47.880 --> 00:48.847
that I can be born.

00:49.040 --> 00:50.087
<i>BARRY". I'm gonna stop you.</i>

00:50.960 --> 00:54.089
- It didn't work.
-You lose, Barry.

00:54.320 --> 00:55.401
No!

00:57.760 --> 00:58.727
Iris.

00:58.920 --> 00:59.921
(INAUDIBLE)

01:39.440 --> 01:40.441
(GASPS)

01:45.560 --> 01:46.561
Oh, no...

01:50.960 --> 01:51.961
(CRYING)

02:02.920 --> 02:03.921
(GASPS)

02:05.360 --> 02:07.727
Iris? Iris.

02:09.720 --> 02:10.721
(WEAKLY) B.A.

02:12.560 --> 02:13.561
What?

02:16.800 --> 02:17.801
B.A.

02:19.480 --> 02:20.561
H.R.?

02:30.960 --> 02:32.121
Dad...

02:37.080 --> 02:38.081
Dad.

02:41.640 --> 02:42.641
Baby?

02:42.960 --> 02:43.961
Yeah.

02:54.440 --> 02:55.441
I don't understand.

02:56.440 --> 02:57.601
It was H.R.

03:00.760 --> 03:02.205
Until the next one.

03:13.320 --> 03:14.321
IRIS: H.R.?

03:15.760 --> 03:16.807
Hi.

03:18.880 --> 03:19.881
Hi.

03:20.280 --> 03:21.611
Let's get you out of here.

03:22.440 --> 03:24.966
- Where is everybody else?
-Couldn't tell.

03:25.160 --> 03:27.970
Barry or Savitar would know I was coming.

03:29.160 --> 03:31.049
- Let's get you out of here.
-Okay.

03:39.720 --> 03:40.721
Get her.

03:47.160 --> 03:49.208
- We can't outrun them.
-No, we can't.

04:01.080 --> 04:02.161
What are you doing?

04:03.240 --> 04:04.844
I'm the reason Savitar found you.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.241
- I need to remedy that.
-Not like this.

04:08.560 --> 04:09.561
Give me that.

04:13.720 --> 04:15.688
Don't! I'm the one he wants, okay?

04:15.880 --> 04:17.848
Please, don't hurt him.

04:21.880 --> 04:22.927
H.R.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.001
Tracy...

04:28.560 --> 04:30.688
- No, no, no...
-it's okay.

04:32.200 --> 04:33.611
Why are you doing this?

04:34.360 --> 04:35.850
I couldn't be a coward.

04:39.440 --> 04:40.680
I'm not a coward.

04:42.880 --> 04:45.451
- But we just found each other.
-I know.

04:48.360 --> 04:51.409
Our story will be brilliant.
You will be brilliant.

04:52.120 --> 04:54.487
You will be glorious, Tracy Brand.

04:54.720 --> 04:58.566
You will be.
I've seen it with my own eyes.

05:00.960 --> 05:01.961
I love you.

05:06.600 --> 05:08.489
- B.A.? B.A.
-I'm right here.

05:09.560 --> 05:10.925
Will you tell Cisco...

05:12.400 --> 05:13.561
Please tell him...

05:17.280 --> 05:20.727
Will you tell him that, for me?

05:21.840 --> 05:23.410
- Yeah.
-Good.

05:24.400 --> 05:25.401
Now,

05:26.840 --> 05:28.080
go stop Savitar.

05:37.920 --> 05:41.083
H.R. H.R.

06:00.960 --> 06:03.008
Savitar took the Speed Force bazooka.

06:11.640 --> 06:12.971
Bye-bye, Vibe.

06:15.680 --> 06:17.170
Keep him alive.

06:18.720 --> 06:20.131
What? Why?

06:20.800 --> 06:23.690
Because I need him
to build something for us.

06:30.160 --> 06:31.366
<i>Iris West Allen.</i>

06:31.720 --> 06:33.210
It changed back.

06:35.160 --> 06:37.162
- Does that mean what I think it means?
-Yeah, Joe.

06:38.160 --> 06:39.366
The future is ours again.

06:46.240 --> 06:47.765
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

06:51.840 --> 06:52.841
<i>Samar'?</i>

06:55.880 --> 06:58.167
- Something's wrong.
-What is it?

07:00.320 --> 07:02.243
She's not dead.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.411
- How is that possible?
-H.R.

07:07.440 --> 07:08.726
He took her place.

07:09.720 --> 07:10.721
H.R.?

07:11.040 --> 07:14.522
- I thought you said H.R. lives.
-Not anymore.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.369
If Iris doesn't die...

07:18.840 --> 07:20.569
That means the future is changing.

07:22.360 --> 07:23.441
So is yours.

07:33.080 --> 07:34.366
JULIAN: What?

07:35.720 --> 07:38.371
H.R. is dead. I can't believe that.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.563
- Is Tracy all right?
- IRIS: Not <i>good.</i>

07:42.040 --> 07:43.451
She just wants to be alone.

07:44.040 --> 07:45.280
There'll be time to mourn.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.245
Right now, we need to figure out
our next move.

07:47.640 --> 07:50.769
So, for the millionth time,
I am lost on all this time travel stuff.

07:50.960 --> 07:53.042
What happens now with Savitar?

07:53.240 --> 07:56.244
Iris didn't die.
So that changes things, right?

07:56.440 --> 07:57.646
I mean, since Iris didn't die,

07:58.080 --> 07:59.809
future me never goes down
that same dark path.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.162
I never create Time Remnants
to fight Savitar.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.767
And if future you never creates
these Time Remnants,

08:05.000 --> 08:08.641
then Savitar himself is never born.

08:08.920 --> 08:12.129
Precisely.
Once the time paradox catches up with him,

08:12.600 --> 08:14.250
then he'll be erased from existence.

08:14.440 --> 08:16.442
- But I saw him, he didn't disappear.
-Not yet.

08:16.680 --> 08:17.920
But he Will, Joe.

08:18.120 --> 08:20.407
Any guesses how long that's going to take?

08:20.640 --> 08:22.130
Maybe a few hours.

08:22.320 --> 08:24.288
You can do a lot of damage in a few hours.

08:24.520 --> 08:27.967
Well, guys, we can't just sit around
and wait for Savitar to disappear.

08:28.480 --> 08:31.086
But Savitar won't become Savitar
if he's erased.

08:31.320 --> 08:33.208
Not unless he pulls off whatever
he's got in mind

08:33.440 --> 08:34.361
before the paradox hits him.

08:34.600 --> 08:36.090
He stole the bazooka for a reason.

08:36.320 --> 08:37.684
- Yeah, why?
-I don't know.

08:37.919 --> 08:39.604
But, remember,
he's been planning this for centuries.

08:39.799 --> 08:40.926
He wants to be a god.

08:41.159 --> 08:44.528
He must need the bazooka and Caitlin
to achieve his goals.

08:45.320 --> 08:48.688
- Anybody got any good news?
-Actually, voila'.

08:49.120 --> 08:52.442
- What is that?
-This, Detective, is a cure for Caitlin.

08:52.640 --> 08:54.324
You're kidding. You figured it out?

08:54.520 --> 08:58.047
Not by myself.
With the help of Caitlin's mother.

08:58.520 --> 09:03.003
This is experimental gene therapy.
This will rewrite Caitlin's meta-DNA.

09:03.200 --> 09:05.885
This Will bring back Caitlin. (CHUCKLES)

09:07.480 --> 09:09.528
I searched the forest.
Savitar and Caitlin were gone.

09:09.880 --> 09:12.167
- So was Cisco.
-Savitar has them both.

09:14.960 --> 09:15.961
(VIBE LAUGHS)

09:17.480 --> 09:19.209
<i>You better have a plan B.</i>

09:19.880 --> 09:22.486
Because I don't think your plan A
worked out too well.

09:23.040 --> 09:24.041
Fix this.

09:25.800 --> 09:28.371
Fix what? The Speed Force bazooka?

09:28.560 --> 09:32.246
I didn't name it.
If I didn't name it, I didn't make it.

09:32.880 --> 09:34.325
And if I didn't make it,

09:35.520 --> 09:37.045
I don't know how it works.

09:37.240 --> 09:40.210
You know enough about it
to alter what it does.

09:40.920 --> 09:44.845
I see. You want me to alter it. Well,
what do you want me to alter it into?

09:45.040 --> 09:46.769
Like a hair dryer? Or a waffle maker?

09:47.200 --> 09:51.171
I know, maybe something that's going to
fix that thin-crust pizza you call a face.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.731
An intra-dimensional quantum splicer.

09:55.600 --> 09:56.567
A splicer?

09:56.760 --> 09:58.410
I do have a plan B.

09:59.280 --> 10:02.409
I open a time portal,
exposing the Speed Force.

10:02.600 --> 10:03.840
You shoot me with that,

10:04.080 --> 10:07.050
and I become fragmented
throughout all of time.

10:07.240 --> 10:10.562
The past, present, future.

10:12.400 --> 10:14.801
After that, the paradox can't reach me.

10:15.920 --> 10:17.763
You want to splice yourself
throughout time.

10:18.400 --> 10:21.290
Exist in every single
moment that ever was.

10:21.520 --> 10:24.888
All of us aware and connected
through one consciousness.

10:25.880 --> 10:26.881
I'll be everywhere.

10:27.280 --> 10:29.601
Every hour, every minute.

10:30.120 --> 10:35.126
And then I will rule from the Big Bang
until the end of the world.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.489
You wanted us to build this thing.

10:37.720 --> 10:40.087
Well, why do you think
I let you idiots live?

10:41.280 --> 10:45.410
Tracy Brand trapped me in the Speed Force
in the future.

10:45.600 --> 10:48.649
All I had to do was get her
to build this a little earlier

10:49.120 --> 10:51.407
and have my best friend
make all the adjustments.

10:51.600 --> 10:56.606
- I'm not your friend.
-Get to work, Francisco.

10:58.600 --> 11:03.288
How about I sit on my ass and let you
obliterate permanently from existence.

11:04.280 --> 11:05.691
How does that sound?

11:15.640 --> 11:18.120
That's your plan?
Do it or you'll Reverse-Flash me?

11:18.600 --> 11:20.125
Not you.

11:21.280 --> 11:22.486
(SOFTLY) Her.

11:27.280 --> 11:28.805
You know what I'm remembering?

11:29.640 --> 11:32.166
Julian just got back to S.T.A.R. Labs.

11:32.360 --> 11:33.646
He has the cure.

11:34.760 --> 11:37.684
He can turn her back.
You can have her back.

11:37.960 --> 11:39.325
You're so close.

11:40.960 --> 11:42.450
But not if she's dead.

11:43.200 --> 11:45.282
So put that mechanical genius
to good work.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.126
Make me what I need,

11:49.520 --> 11:51.648
and I will let you both go.

12:07.400 --> 12:08.401
<i>BARRY". I hated Thawne.</i>

12:09.560 --> 12:10.561
And Zoom.

12:11.040 --> 12:12.371
They took so much from me.

12:13.840 --> 12:17.162
And I've hated Savitar for threatening
to take you away from me, too.

12:18.240 --> 12:19.241
But he didn't.

12:20.200 --> 12:21.201
I know.

12:24.080 --> 12:25.491
There is strength in anger.

12:26.760 --> 12:28.046
I've used it before.

12:29.880 --> 12:32.531
And so we sit here with our anger,

12:32.680 --> 12:36.162
trying to think of a way to hurt Savitar
or maybe kill him.

12:37.720 --> 12:40.041
And I just don't think that hate's gonna
get it done this time.

12:40.720 --> 12:41.721
What do you mean?

12:42.240 --> 12:44.004
Something that Snart said to me.

12:45.080 --> 12:47.526
That the Flash should stay a hero.
All the way.

12:48.360 --> 12:52.365
And sometimes that's not about who can
punch the hardest or run the fastest.

12:56.360 --> 12:57.725
So, what are you going to do?

12:58.400 --> 12:59.686
The last thing he'd expect.

13:23.280 --> 13:24.964
I wasn't sure you'd come.

13:27.080 --> 13:28.730
Must be an odd sensation.

13:29.480 --> 13:30.970
Getting new memories.

13:31.440 --> 13:33.568
<i>You having an uncertain future.</i>

13:34.080 --> 13:36.162
What do you want? I'm busy.

13:36.960 --> 13:37.961
<i>(CHUCKLES) Doing what?</i>

13:38.720 --> 13:40.324
Getting erased from existence?

13:41.120 --> 13:43.851
We will see which one of us gets erased.

13:44.960 --> 13:47.088
Are you still planning on becoming a god?

13:48.400 --> 13:50.289
Cisco and Caitlin are still alive,

13:51.280 --> 13:53.089
-if that's what you're worried about.
-I know.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.125
You need them, right?

13:55.520 --> 13:57.010
To pull off your grand ascension.

13:57.760 --> 14:01.162
Look, Barry,
if I wanted to talk to myself,

14:01.960 --> 14:04.167
I could've done that back at my lair.

14:05.280 --> 14:08.011
What do you want?

14:08.840 --> 14:10.808
- I want to help you.
-Really?

14:11.360 --> 14:14.648
You don't have much time before
the paradox reaches you.

14:16.280 --> 14:17.441
Come back to S.T.A.R. Labs.

14:17.840 --> 14:21.287
Let Cisco and Caitlin go.
And let us figure out a way to save you.

14:21.760 --> 14:23.444
You really think I'd trust you?

14:24.160 --> 14:25.161
You showed up.

14:25.960 --> 14:28.281
So you remember me coming here.
Did I have any tricks up my sleeve?

14:28.480 --> 14:31.450
Was I planning on blindsiding you?

14:32.360 --> 14:35.648
I don't know, Barry.
Maybe I get off on watching you grovel.

14:35.960 --> 14:38.804
No, I don't think that's it.
I think you're hearing me.

14:40.040 --> 14:41.405
I'm still in there.

14:41.960 --> 14:44.804
Deep down,
buried beneath the scars and the pain,

14:44.960 --> 14:48.123
that part of you that must feel so lonely.

14:48.800 --> 14:51.690
<i>But it also knows what it's like
to have a family.</i>

14:52.360 --> 14:53.805
To have friends.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.324
<i>You can have all that back.</i>

14:58.480 --> 15:00.323
We can stop hurting each other.

15:04.080 --> 15:05.730
I remember when I was six

15:07.880 --> 15:11.362
and I begged Mom and Dad to let me
go to the Science Expo in Midway.

15:12.480 --> 15:16.007
And we got a flat tire on that dirt road.
No spare.

15:16.320 --> 15:20.086
<i>So we were towed to that garage
in a tiny one-street town.</i>

15:20.520 --> 15:22.841
Of course, we were stuck there all day.

15:24.520 --> 15:29.731
Then we got ice cream and French fries
with gravy at that little diner.

15:30.920 --> 15:34.891
<i>And then that night we watched
the local fireworks show,</i> and...

15:36.080 --> 15:38.287
It actually turned out to be a great day.

15:39.360 --> 15:42.045
It's my favorite memory of Mom and Dad.

15:44.200 --> 15:46.123
What was the name of that town?

15:48.760 --> 15:49.886
Masonville.

15:52.960 --> 15:54.121
I'm still in there.

15:56.760 --> 15:57.886
Come home.

16:24.440 --> 16:25.726
You make a move toward lris--

16:25.960 --> 16:29.567
He won't. Killing Iris won't save him now.

16:30.080 --> 16:31.081
<i>Not anymore.</i>

16:31.240 --> 16:34.403
- Where's Cisco? Where's Caitlin?
-They're safe.

16:34.600 --> 16:35.761
I was asking him.

16:44.760 --> 16:46.330
Show me that you can help me.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.925
Then I will tell you
where your friends are.

16:50.480 --> 16:52.289
You tell us now or you go up in smoke.

16:52.440 --> 16:53.646
This is bloody insanity.

16:54.440 --> 16:57.284
- What is he doing here? He's a--
-Stop! Guys!

16:57.760 --> 17:01.128
It's okay. Everyone just...

17:04.760 --> 17:06.171
Iris, stay away from him.

17:07.640 --> 17:08.846
Look at me.

17:13.119 --> 17:14.281
It's okay. Look at me.

17:25.480 --> 17:27.005
We're going to help you, okay?

17:40.360 --> 17:41.361
Thank you.

17:42.840 --> 17:43.807
J U LIAN: <i>Right.</i>

17:44.040 --> 17:48.011
Well, since our guest here has both
of our resident scientists hostage,

17:48.880 --> 17:51.486
what temporal problem
can we help you with?

17:53.160 --> 17:56.209
Tracy built the Speed Force trap.
Maybe she has an idea.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.367
- Tracy's our best bet.
-Am I?

18:03.360 --> 18:06.204
So, you're Savitar?

18:07.560 --> 18:10.325
I hear you're about to have
a really bad day.

18:12.840 --> 18:14.524
<i>Good.
-BARRY ". Tracy...</i>

18:16.040 --> 18:17.371
He stole my future.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.045
Why does he deserve one?

18:22.840 --> 18:24.205
I shouldn't have come here.

18:25.520 --> 18:28.205
No. We'll get her to help us.

18:29.520 --> 18:31.682
I think I know someone who might
be able to get through to her.

18:40.360 --> 18:41.361
(GASPS)

18:43.040 --> 18:44.041
I'm not H.R.

18:45.880 --> 18:47.609
My name is Harrison Wells.

18:48.720 --> 18:50.449
I'm from a different Earth.

18:51.200 --> 18:53.202
In the multi-verse... How to explain this?

18:54.040 --> 18:56.202
You're his doppelgénger?

18:58.240 --> 18:59.241
Yeah.

18:59.880 --> 19:00.802
<i>Something like that.</i>

19:01.040 --> 19:02.405
Look, these people,

19:03.920 --> 19:05.285
they are good people.

19:06.080 --> 19:07.081
And they need your help.

19:09.400 --> 19:13.086
By helping the bad guy that
I spent weeks trying to stop?

19:13.400 --> 19:14.401
No.

19:14.920 --> 19:15.921
I won't do it.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.084
The only reason I agreed
was because of H.R.

19:18.560 --> 19:19.766
H.R. needs your help.

19:20.240 --> 19:21.401
H.R. is dead.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.084
That's why you need to stay,

19:25.120 --> 19:28.249
<i>because oi what Samar took from you,
because of what Savfiar took</i>

19:28.960 --> 19:30.610
from H.R., everything.

19:31.640 --> 19:34.484
H.R. paid the price that he did
because he loved these people.

19:36.600 --> 19:37.931
Because he loved you.

19:38.920 --> 19:40.649
And when the moment came,

19:41.600 --> 19:42.931
H.R. didn't run.

19:53.440 --> 19:55.329
It's strange being back here.

19:56.480 --> 19:58.289
You remember S.T.A.R. Labs?

20:00.160 --> 20:01.491
I remember everything.

20:08.280 --> 20:10.965
This is where we came up
with the cerebral inhibitor

20:11.800 --> 20:13.131
to use against DeVoe.

20:13.640 --> 20:14.801
Who?

20:19.160 --> 20:20.810
You haven't gotten there yet.

20:24.800 --> 20:27.326
So, how's this gonna work?
Where will I live?

20:28.640 --> 20:31.803
- What do you mean?
-Are Wally and I gonna be bunkmates?

20:32.160 --> 20:35.801
Am I supposed to just rejoin Team Flash,
fight some rogues?

20:36.160 --> 20:38.891
What kind of life
were you thinking I'd lead?

20:39.840 --> 20:41.842
I hadn't gotten that far yet.

20:42.160 --> 20:44.686
How do we explain me at the wedding?

20:45.480 --> 20:48.484
And do I sit bride-side or groom-side?

20:50.000 --> 20:52.844
Look, I mean,
we don't have all the answers.

20:53.160 --> 20:54.605
You know, we're gonna figure it out.

20:55.520 --> 20:56.521
Together.

21:01.680 --> 21:02.681
No.

21:04.520 --> 21:05.521
Not together.

21:07.520 --> 21:09.841
Love and hate,

21:10.000 --> 21:13.686
they're so close,
it's easy to mistake one for the other.

21:16.520 --> 21:18.966
You're gonna spend the rest
of your life with him.

21:20.360 --> 21:23.204
<i>But I remember giving you the ring.</i>

21:24.200 --> 21:25.531
Singing to you.

21:26.560 --> 21:28.210
Asking you to marry me.

21:33.920 --> 21:34.921
I can't do this.

21:35.720 --> 21:37.404
Yes, you can, okay?

21:38.880 --> 21:40.211
I will be here for you.

21:42.880 --> 21:44.723
I tried to kill you.

21:46.720 --> 21:47.881
I killed H.R.

21:48.400 --> 21:50.402
And you're going
to have to live with that.

21:51.280 --> 21:54.124
But we won't give up on you, okay?
That is not what we do.

21:54.920 --> 21:57.571
There's a way through this. For all of us.

22:00.400 --> 22:02.243
Where are Cisco and Caitlin?

22:11.920 --> 22:13.081
I'll bring them home.

22:20.080 --> 22:21.764
(ALARM BLARING)

22:26.760 --> 22:27.761
What is it?

22:28.280 --> 22:31.124
There's energy radiating
from the breach room.

22:32.600 --> 22:34.125
That's not breach energy.

22:34.600 --> 22:37.285
That's the Philosopher's Stone.
It's releasing all its energy.

22:38.960 --> 22:40.962
- Savitar.
-It looks like it's gonna blow.

22:42.600 --> 22:44.284
Wally, get everybody out.

23:14.960 --> 23:15.961
Is it finished?

23:17.320 --> 23:19.163
Yeah, it's finished.

23:19.800 --> 23:21.165
Fantastic.

23:22.160 --> 23:24.162
You know,
Savitar's gonna turn on you one day.

23:24.840 --> 23:25.841
No, he won't.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.924
A bad guy like Savitar
always turns on his partners.

23:29.320 --> 23:31.482
- Not this time.
-Wake up!

23:32.160 --> 23:34.845
You're only saying that
because he needs something from you.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.526
Once he's done with that,
it's over for you.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.526
- How'd it go?
-As I expected.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.843
I was a fool to think otherwise.

23:45.680 --> 23:47.409
<i>VIBE: Where did he go? What did you do?</i>

23:48.000 --> 23:49.365
I got rid of a problem.

23:50.160 --> 23:51.241
A few of them.

23:52.680 --> 23:54.364
Now I can fix mine.

23:55.840 --> 23:58.207
- Are we ready?
-FROST: Yes.

24:00.240 --> 24:01.241
Do it.

24:03.360 --> 24:04.361
<i>Caitlin.</i>

24:04.520 --> 24:06.522
Listen to me. He'll do it.

24:07.680 --> 24:08.681
He'll kill you.

24:09.200 --> 24:10.531
I'll take my chances.

24:13.360 --> 24:14.361
Gypsy?

24:15.040 --> 24:16.087
Wait! No!

24:18.360 --> 24:21.728
- You don't care that they got away?
-No, it doesn't matter.

24:22.560 --> 24:23.561
It's time.

24:25.040 --> 24:26.041
(GRUNTING)

24:26.880 --> 24:28.211
Ow.

24:28.400 --> 24:29.890
I had that. I was getting through to her.

24:30.200 --> 24:31.281
You were almost killed.

24:31.480 --> 24:33.050
Maybe that's how it looks
to the untrained eye.

24:33.280 --> 24:34.725
These eyes are highly trained.

24:34.920 --> 24:38.083
And I know you were in danger
because I vibed it across the multi-verse.

24:38.720 --> 24:40.609
I can't believe this is the thanks I get
for saving you.

24:40.800 --> 24:43.770
This isn't thanks.
This is the opposite of thanks.

24:44.400 --> 24:45.401
Wait a minute.

24:46.080 --> 24:47.491
How did you vibe that I was in trouble?

24:47.960 --> 24:49.405
Because we are connected.

24:51.240 --> 24:52.241
Jackass.

24:54.440 --> 24:55.441
IRIS: <i>Guys?</i>

24:57.920 --> 24:58.921
Oh, my God.

24:59.400 --> 25:02.449
I thought something happened to you guys.
Two-Face told me you guys were dead.

25:02.680 --> 25:03.647
We're okay.

25:03.840 --> 25:05.251
_Gypsy.
_Gypsy.

25:05.440 --> 25:06.646
- Guys.
-Gypsy.

25:06.840 --> 25:07.807
Harry.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.002
- Here to help.
-Good.

25:11.280 --> 25:12.611
I know what he's up to.

25:13.600 --> 25:15.090
SAVITAR: We have to hurry.

25:15.680 --> 25:19.366
I must become immortal
before the paradox reaches me.

25:20.600 --> 25:23.683
Today I become a god.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.287
This is why I brought you here.

25:36.440 --> 25:40.809
The Speed Force doesn't like it
when speedsters mess with time.

25:41.120 --> 25:42.451
Get ready.

25:57.320 --> 25:58.481
See you later, Hunter.

25:58.640 --> 26:02.964
The one thing
Black Flash can't fight, cold!

26:06.000 --> 26:08.207
Finally, to be a god.

26:29.400 --> 26:32.165
What? No!

26:38.200 --> 26:40.680
I've been waiting a long time to do that.

26:40.840 --> 26:42.888
- Garrick. How did you--
-VIBE: He didn't.

26:44.440 --> 26:45.441
I did.

26:46.840 --> 26:48.683
By changing the polarity
of the climbing arc,

26:48.840 --> 26:52.367
I changed her Speed Force splicer
into a Speed Force skeleton key.

26:52.880 --> 26:55.531
Didn't think I was actually gonna let you
become a god, now, did you?

26:57.920 --> 26:58.921
Let's end this.

26:59.200 --> 27:00.201
Go!

27:42.760 --> 27:44.649
Go ahead, Cisco. Go bad.

27:49.840 --> 27:51.922
No. I never will.

27:52.120 --> 27:53.610
But I will give you a choice.

27:54.960 --> 27:56.530
You want to be Caitlin again?

27:57.080 --> 27:58.081
Here's your chance.

28:03.320 --> 28:04.321
Look out!

28:06.480 --> 28:07.481
(GROANS)

28:08.600 --> 28:10.921
You'll pay for what you did.

28:12.040 --> 28:15.601
And you can die the same way twice.

28:27.720 --> 28:30.291
I knew you didn't have it in you, Caitlin.

28:35.640 --> 28:37.688
I only have a few minutes left.

28:38.200 --> 28:39.406
I can feel it.

28:39.640 --> 28:42.962
But before I go, I'm gonna kill Joe.

28:43.400 --> 28:45.641
And Wally and Iris.

28:46.520 --> 28:49.842
If I'm going to die,
then everything you love

28:50.360 --> 28:52.328
is going to die, too.

29:04.360 --> 29:07.921
How's it feel to get so close
to your ascension,

29:08.240 --> 29:09.765
and end up on the ground?

29:10.000 --> 29:11.081
Now I see...

29:12.520 --> 29:14.329
-it's written.
-Nothing's written.

29:30.200 --> 29:31.247
DO it!

29:32.920 --> 29:35.048
You kill me, you become me.

29:35.360 --> 29:38.443
Either way, I live!

29:51.080 --> 29:52.081
(GASPS)

29:55.800 --> 29:59.566
I'll never let the pain and darkness
determine who I am.

30:00.240 --> 30:01.651
I'll never be you.

30:09.800 --> 30:10.801

30:26.560 --> 30:27.561
-(YELLS)
-(GUN FIRES)

30:53.560 --> 30:55.961
All these months,
you were trying to save me from him.

30:56.480 --> 30:57.970
Look at that, I saved you.

31:23.080 --> 31:24.366
When I think of H.R.,

31:25.080 --> 31:26.491
<i>I'm reminded</i>

31:27.320 --> 31:29.163
<i>of a story that John Lennon once told.</i>

31:30.480 --> 31:33.643
When Lennon was five years old,
his teacher asked him

31:34.640 --> 31:36.802
to write down what he wanted to be
when he grew up.

31:38.800 --> 31:40.290
Lennon wrote "happy."

31:41.320 --> 31:44.324
<i>His teachers said
that he didn't understand the assignment,</i>

31:44.520 --> 31:47.126
and Lennon said
that they didn't understand life.

31:49.480 --> 31:51.164
H.R. understood life.

31:52.040 --> 31:54.964
<i>He wasn't a genius
and he didn't have super-speed,</i>

31:55.200 --> 31:58.647
but when we needed him the most,
he was our hero.

31:59.680 --> 32:00.841
He was my hero.

32:05.840 --> 32:06.841
Mine, too.

32:19.080 --> 32:20.206
Good on you, mate.

32:20.840 --> 32:22.649
Thanks for believing in me, H.R.

32:23.800 --> 32:26.371
I've been looking
for the right time to tell you.

32:27.400 --> 32:28.401
Tell me what?

32:30.040 --> 32:33.328
Right before H.R. died,
he asked me to give you a message.

32:33.760 --> 32:37.731
Tell Cisco, this took strength
and he gave it to me.

32:39.720 --> 32:43.361
I know that you've had a connection
with every Wells that we've met, but...

32:45.080 --> 32:46.889
I don't know.
There's something about this Wells.

32:47.560 --> 32:48.561
Yeah.

32:50.400 --> 32:51.401
Something.

33:01.080 --> 33:02.206
I'll be right back.

33:10.720 --> 33:11.926
Well, well, well.

33:12.760 --> 33:15.240
I guess you're not shopping
at Villains "R" Us anymore.

33:15.400 --> 33:16.561
I'm sorry about H.R.

33:16.760 --> 33:18.410
I'm sure he would have
appreciated you coming.

33:19.200 --> 33:21.089
- Why did you come?
-I don't know.

33:21.920 --> 33:24.400
- Maybe you wanted to come home?
-I don't have a home.

33:24.920 --> 33:26.251
Yes, you do, Caitlin.

33:26.760 --> 33:29.240
You do, with your friends. With me.

33:33.080 --> 33:34.445
I'm sorry, Julian.

33:35.440 --> 33:36.726
I'm not Caitlin anymore.

33:38.720 --> 33:39.926
You're not Killer Frost.

33:40.120 --> 33:42.885
No, I'm not. I'm something else.

33:44.240 --> 33:46.971
And I need to figure out what that is.
On my own.

33:49.280 --> 33:51.601
- Hey.
-Cisco.

33:52.600 --> 33:53.601
Let me go.

34:10.120 --> 34:11.121
(SIGHS)

34:15.800 --> 34:17.609
- Stop it.
-it's not funny.

34:17.800 --> 34:18.766
- I know.
-Why are we laughing?

34:18.960 --> 34:22.203
We should not be laughing.
Today of all days.

34:23.159 --> 34:25.003
I think H.R. would've approved.

34:25.480 --> 34:26.481
Probably.

34:27.639 --> 34:30.007
Are you okay? I mean,

34:31.000 --> 34:32.161
with what you did?

34:34.000 --> 34:35.842
I'm sure one day it'll hit me.

34:36.280 --> 34:39.681
In the future, which I have again.

34:40.320 --> 34:43.290
We have. Every day of it.

34:44.679 --> 34:47.524
<i>(SINGING) Every hour, every minute</i>

34:50.320 --> 34:52.846
I think we have the song picked out
for the dance at our reception.

34:53.960 --> 34:55.324
Yeah, that reminds me.

34:56.480 --> 34:59.848
I can officially mail these.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.206
What are these?

35:01.640 --> 35:03.005
Save-the-date cards for our wedding.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.525
On one of my braver days,
I filled them out.

35:06.800 --> 35:10.805
I never mailed them, not knowing if
I would live to see the ceremony, but...

35:11.680 --> 35:13.364
But now I guess it's safe to--

35:17.040 --> 35:18.201
Delivered.

35:19.520 --> 35:22.524
I wasted a lot of money on stamps.
Thank you very much.

35:25.360 --> 35:28.728
Are you ready to be Iris West-Allen?

35:31.560 --> 35:33.562
- I've always been Iris West-Allen.
-(CHUCKLES)

35:34.360 --> 35:35.566
I've always been yours.

35:36.240 --> 35:37.287
(RUMBLING)

35:38.240 --> 35:39.571
What is that?

35:53.720 --> 35:55.563
There's never been an earthquake
in Central City.

35:59.240 --> 36:01.083
That wasn't an earthquake.

36:08.400 --> 36:09.561
You found something?

36:09.760 --> 36:11.364
Everything is barbecued.

36:11.600 --> 36:13.728
I'm gonna try to establish
an uplink to the satellite.

36:14.760 --> 36:15.761
That's not good.

36:16.920 --> 36:19.491
Hey, Wally, can you reverse
the polarity on the neutron flow?

36:19.720 --> 36:20.642
<i>WALLY'. On it.</i>

36:20.880 --> 36:24.930
Central City Universityjust reported
an earthquake of 6.6 on the Richter scale.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.409
- That's not an earthquake.
-Then what was it?

36:27.600 --> 36:29.489
Earthquakes come from down below. This...

36:29.760 --> 36:30.807
This is something else.

36:31.400 --> 36:32.401
(RUMBLING)

36:38.440 --> 36:39.601
It's getting bad out there.

36:40.440 --> 36:42.966
Emergency services
will soon be overwhelmed.

36:43.280 --> 36:45.408
Guys, 7.2, that last one.

36:45.640 --> 36:47.642
- WALLY: Cisco.
-Yeah. We're on. Guys.

36:50.320 --> 36:51.446
What is that thing?

36:51.840 --> 36:53.126
That's definitely not a breach.

36:53.280 --> 36:54.520
CISCO: Holy plutonium.

36:55.320 --> 36:57.527
What even emits that many kilojoules?

37:00.320 --> 37:01.446
The Speed Force.

37:01.640 --> 37:03.847
- But Savitar is dead.
-That's the problem.

37:04.480 --> 37:05.641
It's the Speed Force prison.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.331
It needs an occupant.

37:07.640 --> 37:09.802
When you freed me, we emptied it.
Without a prisoner--

37:10.040 --> 37:11.166
it goes unstable.

37:11.680 --> 37:13.444
And now it's bleeding energy
onto our Earth.

37:13.640 --> 37:15.324
Okay, so how do we stop this?

37:15.680 --> 37:17.330
By giving it what it needs.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.047
Which is what?

37:30.360 --> 37:32.328
<i>The Speed Force is unbalanced.</i>

37:32.560 --> 37:33.561
(SIREN WAILS)

37:34.680 --> 37:35.841
I have to stabilize it.

37:36.680 --> 37:38.523
- What? How?
-By running into it.

37:38.720 --> 37:40.848
No, you can't.
Barry, you'll be trapped in there forever.

37:41.000 --> 37:42.968
If I don't go, the whole city,

37:43.160 --> 37:45.003
maybe even the entire planet
could be destroyed.

37:45.240 --> 37:48.403
Cisco, there's got to be
another way, right?

37:48.720 --> 37:50.848
Barry, Central City needs the Flash.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.240
And they'll have one.

37:52.720 --> 37:53.721
They'll have one.

37:54.400 --> 37:55.401
All right?

37:57.200 --> 37:59.407
- All right?
-Yeah.

38:04.200 --> 38:05.201
Mate...

38:11.520 --> 38:12.851
Do you mind sticking around?

38:13.040 --> 38:14.371
Anything for you.

38:14.880 --> 38:18.089
Barry, Wally and Jay
said they were in hell.

38:27.040 --> 38:28.280
Barry, it's your mother.

38:32.120 --> 38:33.281
That's the Speed Force.

38:34.560 --> 38:36.130
Barry isn't going to hell.

38:36.400 --> 38:39.609
But like all runners must eventually,
he's reached his finish line.

38:40.120 --> 38:42.441
-(SIGHS)
-His race is over.

38:42.760 --> 38:44.250
You can't take him with you.

38:44.560 --> 38:46.403
She's not taking me anywhere.

38:47.280 --> 38:48.406
I have to go.

38:48.600 --> 38:50.250
Why? Why are you being punished?

38:50.440 --> 38:52.408
This... All of this,

38:52.640 --> 38:55.610
it started with my mistake.
With Flashpoint.

38:55.800 --> 38:57.643
This is my penance.

38:59.440 --> 39:00.771
This is my redemption.

39:02.280 --> 39:03.486
My beautiful boy,

39:05.920 --> 39:07.445
it's time to rest.

39:16.640 --> 39:19.120
- Don't mess it up with her.
-I'll do my best.

39:19.480 --> 39:20.641
They're all gonna look to you now.

39:21.160 --> 39:22.605
I'm not a hero like you.

39:23.440 --> 39:24.771
You've always been my hero.

39:34.640 --> 39:37.644
All this time we're trying to save Iris,
you're telling me

39:38.120 --> 39:39.690
that we should've been trying
to save you, too?

39:42.120 --> 39:43.645
You did save me, Joe.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.651
You took an 11-year-old boy
with a broken heart

39:46.840 --> 39:49.525
and you gave him a home and so much love.

39:50.360 --> 39:52.522
No son ever felt more love from a father.

39:53.840 --> 39:56.207
No father ever felt more proud of a son.

40:00.360 --> 40:01.361
Barry?

40:02.680 --> 40:03.806
<i>It's time.</i>

40:07.160 --> 40:08.207
Barry.

40:09.360 --> 40:10.850
This is unfair.

40:11.480 --> 40:12.481
I know.

40:12.680 --> 40:14.842
We were supposed to have our happy ending.

40:15.040 --> 40:17.008
I'm ready to be Iris West-Allen.

40:17.200 --> 40:18.804
And you always will be.

40:20.160 --> 40:21.889
But you need to keep living your life.

40:22.360 --> 40:24.010
Keep growing.

40:24.520 --> 40:25.646
Keep loving.

40:26.040 --> 40:27.883
Keep running. For me.

40:28.880 --> 40:30.723
Promise me you'll run, Iris.

40:33.360 --> 40:34.486
I promise.

40:42.880 --> 40:44.245
