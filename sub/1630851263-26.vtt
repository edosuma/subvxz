00:34.730 --> 00:37.863
<i>Dinner time, Titans.
Come and get it.</i>

00:39.387 --> 00:41.737
Oh, how I adore
the dinner time!

00:41.780 --> 00:44.522
It's the best time between
the hours of 6:00 and 8:00 p.m.

00:44.566 --> 00:46.655
And I can't wait to become
a saggy, old person

00:46.698 --> 00:49.092
just so I can eat it
even earlier.

00:49.136 --> 00:50.354
Ah!

00:50.398 --> 00:52.748
Mmm-mmm-mmm!
That smells good, yo!

00:52.791 --> 00:55.533
Whatever it is, I hope
it's chock full of flavor.

00:55.577 --> 00:57.883
Then you're in luck, Raven,
because I've just made a dish

00:57.927 --> 01:01.539
that is guaranteed
to tantalize your taste buds.

01:01.583 --> 01:02.845
Salmon loaf.

01:06.240 --> 01:10.853
You expect us to eat
the salmon
in the loaf formation?

01:10.896 --> 01:12.115
That's right, Titans.

01:12.159 --> 01:13.899
But I don't eat
no fishes, fool!

01:13.943 --> 01:15.162
They gots feelings too.

01:15.205 --> 01:17.338
Well, then you can
eat the loaf part.

01:17.381 --> 01:18.817
Mmm, mmm, mmm!

01:18.861 --> 01:22.299
These fish heads are packed
with pure protein.

01:22.343 --> 01:24.867
Man, we don't wanna eat
this slop.

01:24.910 --> 01:27.217
Oh, really? Then what do you
want to eat?

01:27.261 --> 01:28.827
I don't know.

01:28.871 --> 01:29.915
Um, how about something salty?

01:29.959 --> 01:31.221
The something sweet.

01:31.265 --> 01:32.483
Something comforting.

01:32.527 --> 01:34.920
- Yo, I know.

01:34.964 --> 01:36.270
We should eat breakfast

01:36.313 --> 01:37.575
for dinner.

01:37.619 --> 01:39.186
What?

01:41.449 --> 01:44.104
My mind is doing the blowing!

01:44.147 --> 01:47.194
That is the best idea ever.

01:49.196 --> 01:50.849
No, you can't have breakfast
for dinner.

01:50.893 --> 01:53.417
It's unnatural, like
wearing socks with sandals.

01:54.984 --> 01:57.247
But breakfast is the most
important meal of the day.

01:57.291 --> 01:59.162
Yes, but what's even
more important

01:59.206 --> 02:01.164
is eating well balanced meals,

02:01.208 --> 02:02.557
and terrible things
could happen

02:02.600 --> 02:04.254
if you throw off that balance.

02:04.298 --> 02:07.170
Relax, dude. Nothing bad
is gonna happen.

02:07.214 --> 02:08.650
It's just breakfast.

02:08.693 --> 02:11.087
Now who wants
some eggs?

02:11.131 --> 02:12.044
I'll take them.

02:13.655 --> 02:16.527
Stop. You don't know
what you're doing.

02:16.571 --> 02:18.442
Yes, I do. I'm frying up
some eggs.

02:18.486 --> 02:21.402
And I'm squeezing some of that
good orange juice

02:21.445 --> 02:24.492
Ah, it burns.
It burns.

02:24.535 --> 02:27.147
And I am making the cakes
of the pan.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.803
Titans, I'm warning you.

02:31.847 --> 02:35.067
Your careless eating habits
are going to upset the balance.

02:35.111 --> 02:36.808
Would you relax, dude?

02:36.852 --> 02:38.636
Now, why don't you sit
your whiny little butt down

02:38.680 --> 02:40.943
and enjoy some
breakfast food with us?

02:40.986 --> 02:42.292
No way.

02:42.336 --> 02:43.815
There is nothing that's going
to make me

02:43.859 --> 02:45.077
eat breakfast for dinner.

02:45.121 --> 02:48.211
Not even a bowl of
creamed wheat?

02:48.255 --> 02:50.257
Mmm. I do love creamed wheat.

02:50.300 --> 02:52.563
So soggy and flavorless.

02:52.607 --> 02:55.392
Ah, how can I resist?

02:59.179 --> 03:00.441
See, dude.
Nothing bad happened.

03:00.484 --> 03:02.878
I guess eating breakfast
for dinner is okay

03:02.921 --> 03:05.620
as long as we make sure
to never do it again.

03:09.363 --> 03:12.279
Hey, Titans,
what's for lunch?

03:19.938 --> 03:21.940
I thought we were
never doing this again.

03:21.984 --> 03:23.203
That was breakfast for dinner.

03:23.246 --> 03:25.030
And this is breakfast
for lunch.

03:25.074 --> 03:26.902
It is the entirely different.

03:26.945 --> 03:29.687
Plus, we made your favorite.

03:29.731 --> 03:30.993
Creamed wheat?

03:31.036 --> 03:34.126
Well, I suppose
one more meal couldn't hurt.

03:37.869 --> 03:40.655
Wow! That was the best lunch
I've ever had.

03:40.698 --> 03:43.135
It certainly was
the most delicious.

03:43.179 --> 03:45.094
Breakfast foods are the best.

03:45.137 --> 03:48.706
Yo, I bet every meal
is better as breakfast.

04:45.981 --> 04:46.938
Know what I could go for?

04:46.982 --> 04:48.375
Breakfast!

04:50.464 --> 04:53.293
Yo,
we's out of breakfast food!

04:53.336 --> 04:54.772
What?

04:54.816 --> 04:56.600
There's got to be something
in here we can eat.

04:56.644 --> 04:58.428
Cyborg, check the fridge.

04:59.647 --> 05:01.605
Ugh! We got caviar, lobster,

05:01.649 --> 05:03.390
a couple of pounds
of prime rib.

05:03.433 --> 05:06.001
No, those are all
garbage foods.

05:08.133 --> 05:10.745
We need the foods
that will break the fast.

05:10.788 --> 05:13.617
Look, the waffle crumbs!

05:13.661 --> 05:16.881
Ah, out of my way,
those are my floor crumbs.

05:19.362 --> 05:22.147
Titans, wait!
We don't have to do this.

05:22.191 --> 05:23.323
Oh, really?

05:23.366 --> 05:24.411
And where are we
supposed to get

05:24.454 --> 05:26.587
breakfast food at this hour?

05:39.861 --> 05:40.949
Ah!

05:42.690 --> 05:45.214
Yo, what's a nine-letter
word for dinner?

05:45.257 --> 05:46.389
Breakfast.

05:46.433 --> 05:48.348
Oh, yeah.

05:48.391 --> 05:50.001
Great idea, Robin.

05:50.045 --> 05:51.786
Mmm.

05:51.829 --> 05:54.745
With this diner, we never have
to go without breakfast again--

05:59.576 --> 06:01.186
Yo, I warned you about

06:01.230 --> 06:03.188
drinking too much
OJ, fool.

06:14.896 --> 06:17.202
We's turned into
breakfast foods.

06:17.246 --> 06:18.726
But the why?

06:18.769 --> 06:21.032
Because we haven't been
eating well balanced meals.

06:21.076 --> 06:23.426
I knew something bad
like this was going to happen.

06:23.470 --> 06:25.123
So what do we do now?

06:25.167 --> 06:28.388
I do not wish to be
the breakfast food forever.

06:28.431 --> 06:29.954
We need to get help
from an expert.

06:29.998 --> 06:33.218
But where are we gonna find
an expert on meals?

06:33.262 --> 06:36.091
Right here. In Mealtopia.

06:37.571 --> 06:39.050
That sounds like a plan.

06:39.094 --> 06:41.531
Yeah. And when we's done,
we can eat more breakfast.

06:41.575 --> 06:44.055
- Ow!
- No more breakfast!

06:44.099 --> 06:45.230
Titans, go!

06:45.274 --> 06:46.449
To Mealtopia!

06:49.278 --> 06:51.236
- We made it!

06:54.239 --> 06:55.371
Something's wrong.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.590
It's not safe here.

06:56.633 --> 06:58.548
Quick, follow me!

07:07.601 --> 07:09.254
Who are you guys?

07:09.298 --> 07:10.473
I am Mr. Lunch.

07:10.517 --> 07:11.561
And this is Mrs. Snack,

07:11.605 --> 07:12.997
Miss Dinner

07:13.041 --> 07:14.564
and Miss Dinner's rural cousin,
Mr. Supper.

07:16.871 --> 07:18.263
Then maybe you can help us.

07:18.307 --> 07:19.569
We ate too much breakfast

07:19.613 --> 07:21.266
and got turned
into breakfast foods.

07:21.310 --> 07:24.400
So you're the ones responsible
for empowering Mr. Breakfast.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.401
It was bad enough

07:25.445 --> 07:26.837
he was all high and mighty

07:26.881 --> 07:28.796
about being the most
important meal of the day.

07:28.839 --> 07:31.451
But now he's out of control.

07:31.494 --> 07:33.322
What do you mean
out of control?

07:34.454 --> 07:36.456
Oh, no! He's here!

07:41.112 --> 07:42.549
Oh, hey, guys.

07:42.592 --> 07:44.202
Mr. Breakfast!

07:51.035 --> 07:53.777
Put me down. I don't want to
become breakfast food.

07:53.821 --> 07:56.345
But everybody enjoys breakfast.

07:56.388 --> 07:58.173
You'll see.

08:01.350 --> 08:04.092
He just turned Mr. Lunch

08:04.135 --> 08:05.876
into Mr. Brunch.

08:05.920 --> 08:08.052
I know. Isn't it great?

08:12.709 --> 08:14.624
Yo, we got to stop this, bro.

08:14.668 --> 08:16.757
We enjoy eating
them other meals, too.

08:16.800 --> 08:20.325
But breakfast is the most
important meal of the day.

08:27.550 --> 08:28.986
He is not the listening.

08:29.030 --> 08:31.641
Then we've got no choice
but to take him down

08:31.685 --> 08:34.775
It's time for a food fight!

08:36.211 --> 08:37.604
Eat bacon grease!

08:40.041 --> 08:41.999
Yum!

08:42.043 --> 08:45.046
Enjoy the browns
that are the hash!

08:47.962 --> 08:50.051
Creamed wheat coming your way!

08:50.704 --> 08:52.575
Mmm!

08:52.619 --> 08:55.230
Waffles! Waffles! Waffles!

08:57.232 --> 08:59.364
Delicious!

09:02.629 --> 09:04.195
It's too hard
to fight as an egg.

09:05.588 --> 09:07.329
He's too powerful!

09:07.372 --> 09:08.809
We may as well face it, Titans,

09:08.852 --> 09:10.854
nothing is better
than breakfast.

09:10.898 --> 09:12.682
<i>Oh, really?</i>

09:14.728 --> 09:17.513
- Is that...
- It cannot be!

09:17.557 --> 09:19.559
Yo, it is!

09:19.602 --> 09:21.082
Mr. Dessert!

09:23.388 --> 09:24.955
Yes!

09:25.739 --> 09:27.305
I'm sorry, Mr. Breakfast,

09:27.349 --> 09:30.570
but it's time for you
to break, and fast!

09:33.355 --> 09:36.140
Let's start with
a couple of cherry bombs.

09:37.228 --> 09:38.273
Ah!

09:39.100 --> 09:40.405
Ow.

09:40.449 --> 09:41.711
Hey!

09:41.755 --> 09:44.061
And a dash
of heat-seeking sprinkles.

09:47.151 --> 09:49.806
And top it off
with a hot fudge frenzy!

09:55.507 --> 09:57.771
Now it's time to whip it good.

10:01.035 --> 10:03.080
- No!

10:04.734 --> 10:05.953
Oh, no!

10:10.958 --> 10:13.134
Yes! We're back to normal.

10:14.875 --> 10:18.400
I'm sorry for turning everybody
into breakfast food.

10:18.443 --> 10:21.446
I guess I let the power
go to my head.

10:21.490 --> 10:24.275
From now on,
we shall only break the fast

10:24.319 --> 10:26.538
when the fast
needs to be the broken.

10:26.582 --> 10:27.757
That's right.

10:27.801 --> 10:29.106
We've definitely
learned the importance

10:29.150 --> 10:31.021
of eating well balanced meals.

10:31.065 --> 10:32.675
Now who wants ice cream
for dinner?
