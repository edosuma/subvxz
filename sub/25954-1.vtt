01:17.594 --> 01:18.837
We're here.

01:24.049 --> 01:25.769
- Ready? One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

01:54.148 --> 01:55.287
What's wrong?

01:57.047 --> 01:58.152
Nothing.

02:00.361 --> 02:01.535
It's just...

02:02.846 --> 02:04.745
You've always been the
one with the vision.

02:05.228 --> 02:06.402
That's fine.

02:07.851 --> 02:09.381
I'd just like to
know what's going on

02:09.405 --> 02:11.176
from time to time.

02:11.200 --> 02:12.580
Be in the loop, you know.

02:17.827 --> 02:19.035
You hungry?

02:32.117 --> 02:33.325
You want some of this taco?

02:37.324 --> 02:39.564
Are you gonna talk to me, or
are you gonna cause yourself

02:39.588 --> 02:40.865
a palpitation over there?

02:41.678 --> 02:43.542
I heard the old
man's getting out.

02:45.441 --> 02:46.442
What?

02:47.615 --> 02:48.616
When?

02:49.341 --> 02:51.250
Could be tomorrow,

02:51.274 --> 02:52.793
could be the day after that.

02:53.759 --> 02:56.704
Might be that he's already out.

02:56.728 --> 02:58.848
I didn't think they just let
pedophiles out like that.

02:58.872 --> 03:01.232
You'd think they'd keep 'em
locked up as long as they could.

03:03.631 --> 03:05.115
You think he'll
come around here?

03:06.876 --> 03:09.510
It's been in every ear
we've got all his money.

03:09.534 --> 03:11.605
He might not have
anywhere else to go.

03:12.399 --> 03:14.446
What about our clients?

03:14.470 --> 03:16.510
He wasn't supposed to get
out for another two years.

03:16.534 --> 03:18.208
You said we'd be in
Fairbanks before that.

03:18.232 --> 03:19.232
I know.

03:20.821 --> 03:21.821
Vincent,

03:22.823 --> 03:24.697
we're still going to Alaska.

03:24.721 --> 03:26.136
That hasn't changed.

03:27.586 --> 03:28.760
Only now,

03:29.761 --> 03:31.590
we're going to do some things...

03:33.420 --> 03:34.811
A little sooner?

03:34.835 --> 03:36.053
Mmm.

03:36.077 --> 03:37.986
That's why we moved
Lloyd's loot.

03:38.010 --> 03:39.712
And we're selling
the other half.

03:39.736 --> 03:42.083
See? Now you're in the loop.

03:43.292 --> 03:45.718
You think you can
get rid of them?

03:45.742 --> 03:47.548
I'm going to meet
someone tomorrow

03:47.572 --> 03:50.644
who makes it his business to
move all sorts of things.

03:51.990 --> 03:54.417
Come on, let's finish up with Mrs.
Olarian

03:54.441 --> 03:55.649
and get out of here.

05:52.421 --> 05:55.676
Making donations...

05:55.700 --> 05:58.368
Transfer the word of her cause,
you know, spread the good word.

06:03.259 --> 06:05.410
Hubba, hubba.

06:05.434 --> 06:08.437
1916 Mercury Head dime.

06:10.128 --> 06:11.923
What do you want me
to do, make an offer?

06:13.787 --> 06:15.074
One dollar.

06:15.098 --> 06:17.422
Hmm. Worth thousands.

06:17.446 --> 06:20.735
Mint condition. Easily 10 grand.

06:20.759 --> 06:22.979
But these aren't mint condition.

06:23.003 --> 06:25.661
But they're something, and
I've got a few of 'em.

06:29.561 --> 06:32.885
Well, I know a lady
out in Encino Wells

06:32.909 --> 06:35.094
be interested in
this sort of thing.

06:35.118 --> 06:36.741
Might be willing to
go as high as...

06:38.432 --> 06:40.745
I don't know. $2,200?

06:42.091 --> 06:43.092
Deal.

06:44.024 --> 06:47.244
Let's call it an even $2,000.

06:47.268 --> 06:50.075
I've got a bunch more.

06:50.099 --> 06:52.826
I can't see any reason why
we both can't prosper.

06:54.310 --> 06:55.977
I know you're a busy man, Art,

06:56.001 --> 06:57.658
but I got one more
thing before you go.

07:16.815 --> 07:18.759
What the fuck, Jim?

07:18.783 --> 07:20.783
He came through trying to
pull scrap from the yard.

07:21.820 --> 07:23.719
He killed Miwalk, my dog.

07:25.548 --> 07:27.268
The boys caught him
trying to hop the fence.

07:29.552 --> 07:30.657
He was a good watchdog.

07:31.658 --> 07:32.693
Good protector.

07:34.523 --> 07:36.443
I was gonna see if you can
get rid of him for me.

07:38.009 --> 07:39.148
Me?

07:39.528 --> 07:40.608
How?

07:40.632 --> 07:43.024
Maybe use that furnace of yours?

07:43.048 --> 07:46.303
I... I don't know, Jim.
I mean...

07:46.327 --> 07:47.567
I don't want to get mixed up...

07:47.591 --> 07:48.696
But now you know about it.

07:48.720 --> 07:50.411
You've seen him.

07:50.435 --> 07:53.155
It's never a good idea to know about
something and not be part of it.

07:54.750 --> 07:55.751
Ah.

07:56.648 --> 07:57.891
Well...

07:59.628 --> 08:00.628
Maybe...

08:00.652 --> 08:03.493
Maybe I could do something.

08:03.517 --> 08:05.668
Yeah? I like that.

08:05.692 --> 08:07.152
You get rid of something for me,

08:07.176 --> 08:09.040
I get rid of something for you.

08:10.213 --> 08:11.352
Give me your keys.

08:15.218 --> 08:16.378
Put him in the mayor's trunk.

08:19.464 --> 08:21.017
Make sure you lay
down enough plastic.

08:22.087 --> 08:23.192
Thank you.

09:17.798 --> 09:19.904
Ooh! Lloyd Mickey!

09:23.286 --> 09:24.425
Oh!

09:25.426 --> 09:26.472
Dolores.

09:26.496 --> 09:27.991
Let me look at you.

09:28.015 --> 09:29.717
If the Lord had offered
me a hundred...

09:29.741 --> 09:31.477
The phones work?

09:31.501 --> 09:33.652
The phones? Yes, they should.

09:33.676 --> 09:36.310
I mean, not on account of
anyone's been calling, but...

09:36.334 --> 09:39.002
It's been about a month
since someone's called.

09:39.026 --> 09:40.821
Even then it was for
the wrong number.

09:50.866 --> 09:52.005
What's this?

09:53.213 --> 09:55.318
Um, it's all your mail.

09:58.287 --> 10:00.023
From the past year?

10:00.047 --> 10:02.992
Mmm-hmm. Normally, I go out and
I get the mail when it comes in

10:03.016 --> 10:05.650
in the afternoon and I
set it on your desk.

10:05.674 --> 10:08.031
I like to keep the wheels
of progress turning

10:08.055 --> 10:09.308
while you're gone.

10:09.332 --> 10:11.172
Have you been coming
in every day?

10:11.196 --> 10:12.196
Mmm-hmm.

10:13.716 --> 10:15.660
How have you been getting paid?

10:15.684 --> 10:17.244
Well, I've just been
keeping a record of

10:17.268 --> 10:19.767
my hours and my back pay.

10:19.791 --> 10:21.310
Can I get you a cup of coffee?

10:22.069 --> 10:23.875
I need Arthur's number.

10:23.899 --> 10:26.619
Arthur Herring? It should be right
there in the Rolodex on your desk.

10:28.248 --> 10:29.777
What do you need
with Arthur Herring?

10:29.801 --> 10:32.055
That man is too much.

10:32.079 --> 10:34.254
Did you know that they
made him the mayor?

10:36.014 --> 10:37.336
A mayor?

10:37.360 --> 10:38.638
Didn't you hear?

10:39.742 --> 10:42.572
Arthur Herring is a mayor?

10:45.092 --> 10:47.267
Well, will that be all?

11:56.267 --> 11:59.477
Oh! I was just gonna let you
know I'll be leaving now.

12:24.813 --> 12:25.814
Hey, Arthur.

12:26.918 --> 12:28.023
No, I'm at the restaurant.

12:29.472 --> 12:31.129
Okay, I'll see you
when you get here.

12:33.373 --> 12:34.615
Was that your brother?

12:35.616 --> 12:38.768
Connie. I didn't see you there.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.287
You guys are close, huh?

12:40.311 --> 12:42.530
Well, he's my brother.

12:42.554 --> 12:45.844
- And you live together?
- Yeah.

12:45.868 --> 12:47.828
You guys are funny. You
don't look anything alike.

12:51.391 --> 12:53.271
I'm so glad someone finally
came in to fix this.

12:54.290 --> 12:56.475
Oh. I thought it just
started acting up?

12:56.499 --> 12:59.030
Well, yeah. But it's been
backing up for weeks

12:59.054 --> 13:02.309
and now it just doesn't work.

13:02.333 --> 13:04.690
Well, I should have it
fixed here in just a bit.

13:04.714 --> 13:06.623
Connie, you have a four top.

13:06.647 --> 13:07.648
Oh.

13:08.511 --> 13:10.696
Well, gotta go.

13:10.720 --> 13:12.308
Okay. See you, Connie.

13:14.828 --> 13:18.211
Sure. I loved it. It was crazy.
A 270 Chevy...

13:19.276 --> 13:20.396
I didn't know you were here.

13:20.420 --> 13:22.536
I just walked in, saw Ron here,

13:22.560 --> 13:25.125
and we've been talking about
taking the van in for a tune up.

13:25.149 --> 13:27.575
It'll be a good idea.
It's been idling high.

13:27.599 --> 13:29.198
Bring it in anytime.

13:29.222 --> 13:31.742
But I probably won't get a chance
to look at it until next week.

13:31.766 --> 13:33.077
- Next week works.
- All right.

13:34.261 --> 13:35.781
Do you wanna get
something to eat here,

13:35.805 --> 13:37.309
or you wanna go some place else?

13:37.333 --> 13:39.415
Actually, I'm not too
hungry right now.

13:39.439 --> 13:41.589
I wanted to see if you
could give me a hand

13:41.613 --> 13:43.173
getting some things
out of the Cadillac.

13:43.197 --> 13:45.179
- You give me a call next week,

13:45.203 --> 13:46.803
and I'll take a look
at that van for you.

13:46.998 --> 13:48.182
Will do.

13:48.206 --> 13:49.898
All right. Go get me a beer.

14:06.466 --> 14:07.950
This isn't office supplies.

14:20.618 --> 14:21.722
Who keeps calling?

14:23.966 --> 14:25.564
No one.

14:25.588 --> 14:28.419
Is this all part of the plan?

14:31.111 --> 14:32.457
Must be some plan.

14:38.636 --> 14:40.155
Come on, we got church tomorrow.

15:14.154 --> 15:15.960
Oh! Oh!

15:15.984 --> 15:17.123
Oh! Oh!

15:18.020 --> 15:19.159
Oh!

16:02.823 --> 16:03.928
Fuck me!

16:06.034 --> 16:07.908
In the Messiah,

16:07.932 --> 16:10.324
crucified and risen,

16:10.348 --> 16:13.017
we recognize the features

16:13.041 --> 16:15.975
of the lamb sacrificed
on Golgotha,

16:17.528 --> 16:22.129
who implores forgiveness
for his torturers,

16:22.153 --> 16:25.501
and opens the gates of
Heaven to repentant sinners.

16:27.400 --> 16:30.379
We glimpse

16:30.403 --> 16:32.519
the face of the immortal king,

16:32.543 --> 16:34.614
who now has the keys

16:35.339 --> 16:37.858
of death and Hades.

16:39.619 --> 16:43.392
This is the word of the Lord.

16:43.416 --> 16:46.257
Praise be to God.

16:46.281 --> 16:47.351
Please be seated.

16:51.872 --> 16:54.403
Hey, Lloyd. Didn't
expect to see you today.

16:54.427 --> 16:55.738
I bet you didn't!

16:57.257 --> 16:59.615
What, the big man won't see me?

16:59.639 --> 17:01.054
It's not like that, Lloyd.

17:02.607 --> 17:03.953
He's been ducking my calls.

17:04.608 --> 17:05.723
He can't duck me.

17:05.748 --> 17:07.105
- Now...
- Not in this town.

17:07.128 --> 17:09.073
Now, let's keep our voices down.

17:09.097 --> 17:11.075
No one's trying to duck you.

17:11.098 --> 17:12.559
We didn't know you
were out, Lloyd.

17:12.583 --> 17:13.800
How could we?

17:13.825 --> 17:15.585
We've just been busier
than a couple of bees,

17:15.608 --> 17:18.116
what with the funeral
home and the restaurant.

17:18.140 --> 17:19.944
Now that Arthur got
appointed Mayor,

17:19.969 --> 17:21.705
I don't know where we
even find the time.

17:21.730 --> 17:23.396
Well, you better make some time.

17:23.421 --> 17:26.262
Lloyd, please. Last we heard, you
were going in for three years.

17:26.286 --> 17:28.092
- Remember?
- Yeah.

17:28.116 --> 17:29.772
Yeah. Well, I'm out now.

17:30.980 --> 17:32.958
I want my stuff back.

17:32.982 --> 17:34.950
And if he won't see
me, I'll see him.

17:36.089 --> 17:37.135
You tell him.

17:37.159 --> 17:38.999
If I have to suffer him,

17:39.023 --> 17:41.450
he's gonna have to suffer me.

17:41.474 --> 17:43.452
And I ain't one for suffering!

17:43.476 --> 17:45.764
Okay, Lloyd. I'll let him know.

17:45.788 --> 17:46.824
Good!

17:47.928 --> 17:49.137
We'll be in touch.

18:02.771 --> 18:05.267
And I would like to offer,
from myself to you,

18:05.291 --> 18:07.338
a funeral at no cost,

18:07.362 --> 18:09.029
as a gift.

18:09.053 --> 18:10.996
Thank you.

18:11.020 --> 18:12.988
Would you excuse me? Thank you.

18:17.337 --> 18:19.798
What the fuck was that?

18:19.822 --> 18:21.376
I couldn't believe
he just showed up.

18:22.515 --> 18:24.320
What did he say?

18:24.344 --> 18:27.841
Well, you know, that he's out.

18:27.865 --> 18:30.025
He said that he's been trying
to get in touch with you,

18:30.049 --> 18:31.155
and that he wants his

18:31.179 --> 18:32.052
stuff back.

18:32.076 --> 18:34.285
Of course he wants his stuff.

18:35.493 --> 18:37.609
He called me a couple of times.

18:37.633 --> 18:39.991
I haven't spoken with him.

18:40.015 --> 18:42.649
Jeez, Arthur. It's no
wonder he showed up.

18:42.673 --> 18:44.364
He's probably gonna
keep showing up.

18:45.054 --> 18:46.090
He looked

18:46.987 --> 18:48.551
desperate.

18:48.575 --> 18:51.371
We need to go see
Lloyd tomorrow.

19:00.069 --> 19:01.140
Hello.

19:01.588 --> 19:02.727
Connie.

19:04.557 --> 19:05.913
I wasn't planning on it.

19:05.937 --> 19:08.088
But I could be there later on.

19:08.112 --> 19:09.872
Is there something
wrong with the sink?

19:11.357 --> 19:12.357
Oh.

19:14.843 --> 19:16.051
Is this your idea?

19:24.680 --> 19:25.957
Look, I can't really talk.

19:27.511 --> 19:28.512
Okay, bye now.

19:36.382 --> 19:38.280
So, how did that go?

19:39.039 --> 19:40.144
It went fine.

19:41.076 --> 19:42.605
Just fine?

19:42.629 --> 19:44.217
It's the heart. No different.

19:45.529 --> 19:47.634
Gave me some heart pills.
Same as usual.

19:51.880 --> 19:52.915
Give me a smoke.

20:10.830 --> 20:11.830
Come in.

20:18.665 --> 20:19.977
Holy shit, Lloyd.

20:21.116 --> 20:22.611
Hey, Lloyd.

20:22.635 --> 20:24.292
Come in, come in.

20:25.603 --> 20:26.777
What happened here?

20:28.986 --> 20:30.677
Vagrants, probably.

20:33.404 --> 20:34.474
Are you sleeping in there?

20:35.613 --> 20:37.684
There is shit on the bed.

20:38.616 --> 20:40.076
Burned the old one.

20:40.100 --> 20:41.481
What happened to the cushion?

20:42.620 --> 20:45.623
They pissed on those,
put a hole there,

20:47.487 --> 20:49.144
in case of company.

20:57.704 --> 20:58.750
Mick...

20:58.774 --> 21:00.500
I need that gold, Arthur.

21:02.226 --> 21:03.848
I need those coins.

21:07.335 --> 21:10.234
I've been collecting them.
That's my insurance.

21:11.960 --> 21:13.168
Always has been.

21:14.445 --> 21:16.344
I can't help but wonder,

21:18.553 --> 21:20.841
what happened to my old friend?

21:20.865 --> 21:23.040
What happened to my Mick?

21:24.041 --> 21:25.870
I want that stuff, Arthur.

21:27.320 --> 21:28.908
No two ways about it.

21:30.461 --> 21:31.980
So I figure you're here

21:32.739 --> 21:34.648
to give me my money.

21:34.672 --> 21:37.226
Or you're here to kill me.

21:40.333 --> 21:41.813
How could you say
something like that?

21:42.749 --> 21:45.970
Because it's a lot
of money, Arthur.

21:45.994 --> 21:47.892
I know how you two do business.

21:50.516 --> 21:51.724
That upsets me.

21:53.381 --> 21:55.980
Words like that make me
think, "Well, maybe"

21:56.004 --> 21:58.765
I should hold on to it a
little while longer."

22:00.698 --> 22:03.367
Look...

22:03.391 --> 22:05.472
I'll give you money if you need.

22:05.496 --> 22:07.267
I mean, get some new curtains,

22:07.291 --> 22:09.776
straighten out and
what not, you know.

22:11.433 --> 22:13.332
You weren't listening to me.

22:15.886 --> 22:18.278
I just want what's coming to me.

22:18.302 --> 22:21.177
Well, it sounds like
you need to own up

22:21.201 --> 22:22.927
to some of the
things you've done.

22:23.618 --> 22:25.389
We all do.

22:25.413 --> 22:27.035
Oh, don't give me that.

22:28.968 --> 22:31.211
Trying to come here
and preach to me?

22:33.317 --> 22:35.744
I'm the one who gave
you the fucking idea

22:35.768 --> 22:39.748
to start a church
in the first place.

22:39.772 --> 22:43.603
And I recall it had a lot more
to do with tax exemptions

22:44.777 --> 22:46.157
than religion.

22:48.539 --> 22:50.127
You ain't here as a priest,

22:50.886 --> 22:52.267
and you know it.

22:53.786 --> 22:57.317
You're here as the guy
who's holding my money.

22:57.341 --> 22:59.457
And I probably wouldn't have

22:59.481 --> 23:01.218
had I known I was helping
you hide that from

23:01.230 --> 23:02.978
the kid and his family
in the civil suit.

23:03.002 --> 23:04.244
It doesn't matter.

23:06.488 --> 23:09.916
You'll get your 10%.
That's what we agreed on.

23:09.940 --> 23:14.082
But don't come at me
like some pious entity.

23:17.568 --> 23:20.571
You're a man just like me.

23:22.953 --> 23:24.989
So, like I said, either
give me my money,

23:26.025 --> 23:27.451
so I can leave,

23:27.475 --> 23:28.579
or kill me.

24:19.216 --> 24:20.780
What do you want?

24:20.804 --> 24:21.839
Beer.

24:24.083 --> 24:25.153
Anything will do.

24:49.280 --> 24:50.765
Pervert.

25:00.291 --> 25:02.097
Sorry.

25:20.864 --> 25:21.899
Another.

25:29.597 --> 25:30.677
What's this?

25:30.701 --> 25:32.955
He's a sharp shooter.

25:32.979 --> 25:34.543
They have a pigeon
shooting booth.

25:34.567 --> 25:36.269
I won.

25:36.293 --> 25:39.030
Maybe it'd do everybody good if
they got rid of those old rifles

25:39.054 --> 25:40.584
and used a pistol.

25:40.608 --> 25:41.895
A .22 would be good.

25:41.919 --> 25:43.794
A .22 ain't got no
stopping power.

25:43.818 --> 25:45.458
Yeah, but it'll make
you pause long enough

25:45.482 --> 25:47.418
for someone to get a
couple more rounds in you.

25:47.442 --> 25:49.247
That'll stop you for sure.

25:49.271 --> 25:50.594
If it's a head shot,

25:50.618 --> 25:52.561
at the right angle, there's
no way someone could

25:52.585 --> 25:54.598
pull ballistics if
it's done just right.

25:54.622 --> 25:56.323
You get a lot of those, do you,

25:56.347 --> 25:57.773
down at the funeral home?

25:57.797 --> 25:59.050
Not a whole lot.

25:59.074 --> 26:00.628
Thank God.

26:01.836 --> 26:03.941
But we've seen our share
of interesting things.

26:05.598 --> 26:08.646
You ever seen a man done
in by one of those M107s?

26:08.670 --> 26:10.406
Now that's a .50 cal.

26:10.430 --> 26:13.444
I watched this Marine use it against
a terrorist on the Internet.

26:13.468 --> 26:16.343
Blew a hole in that guy the
size of Jeffery's head.

26:16.367 --> 26:18.369
- Jesus, Ron!
- What? It's true.

26:19.854 --> 26:22.073
I can't say that we've
seen anything like that.

26:22.097 --> 26:25.653
I'm gonna go find myself a
more worthwhile conversation.

26:26.446 --> 26:27.446
Get on it, will you.

26:56.407 --> 26:58.168
Lloyd. Lloyd!

26:59.065 --> 27:00.456
How are you getting home?

27:00.480 --> 27:01.585
I'm gonna walk.

27:05.549 --> 27:07.589
Just tell the boys I'll be
a little late, all right?

27:07.613 --> 27:09.097
Don't deal any hands without me.

27:10.490 --> 27:12.296
Come on, Lloyd.

27:12.320 --> 27:15.120
I don't need you getting in an accident
so I'll lose my liquor license.

27:15.144 --> 27:15.955
Come on, come on.

27:15.979 --> 27:17.939
I should have never served
you in the first place.

27:17.963 --> 27:19.067
Come on, Lloyd.

27:21.225 --> 27:22.744
Lloyd, you still
on Cutter's Grove?

27:26.403 --> 27:28.381
Are you still on Cutter's Grove?

27:58.435 --> 27:59.643
Hey...

28:02.128 --> 28:04.717
You wanna make $20

28:05.960 --> 28:07.271
the easy way?

28:08.238 --> 28:09.584
- What?
- Ha!

28:10.758 --> 28:11.862
Okay.

28:12.794 --> 28:15.107
You wanna make $20

28:16.039 --> 28:17.454
the hard way? Huh?

28:19.663 --> 28:20.744
Fuck you!

28:24.564 --> 28:25.669
You're a piece of shit.

28:33.056 --> 28:34.229
I'll pay you.

28:35.299 --> 28:36.404
Fuck you.

28:38.786 --> 28:40.235
Just kill me.

28:41.271 --> 28:43.042
I'll pay you.

28:43.066 --> 28:45.044
I'll pay you to kill me.

28:45.068 --> 28:46.621
I should get money.

28:48.485 --> 28:49.728
You are fucked up, old man.

28:50.798 --> 28:53.145
Just do it...

30:07.012 --> 30:09.255
Yep, I'm still here.
Just listening is all.

30:12.189 --> 30:15.227
Seems like you got yourself a jar
full of pickles down there, Frank.

30:17.091 --> 30:18.758
I reckon I could
send someone down.

30:18.782 --> 30:20.415
It might be a little
more unbiased.

30:20.439 --> 30:23.245
Can put a clean eye
on things for you.

30:23.269 --> 30:25.149
Seems like that's what you
all might be needing.

30:27.584 --> 30:28.999
Okay, then, Frank.

30:30.552 --> 30:32.623
All right, then.

30:43.220 --> 30:44.256
Orlando?

30:46.775 --> 30:48.063
Yeah, Chief?

30:48.087 --> 30:50.203
You gunning for something
new, ain't you?

30:50.227 --> 30:51.711
Never been one for office work.

30:53.575 --> 30:55.208
Those corns again?

30:55.232 --> 30:58.867
Yeah, my dogs are barking.

30:58.891 --> 31:02.906
My wife, she told me to rub
'em with lavender oil.

31:02.930 --> 31:04.597
I've been doing that, but,

31:04.621 --> 31:08.118
I can't go anywhere without
smelling like a French whore.

31:09.660 --> 31:11.041
Now, come on in.

31:13.078 --> 31:15.884
I just got off the phone
with Frank Kilgore.

31:15.908 --> 31:18.231
He's a DA in Cardinal County.

31:18.255 --> 31:19.878
They just had a
murder down there.

31:20.740 --> 31:23.236
First in 39 years or so.

31:23.260 --> 31:27.102
An old man, killed execution
style in his home.

31:27.126 --> 31:28.932
Sounds like a jar
full of pickles.

31:28.956 --> 31:30.612
That's what I said.

31:32.338 --> 31:35.421
I was thinking about
sending you to help out.

31:35.445 --> 31:38.758
See if can't figure out which
way is up with the whole of it.

31:39.828 --> 31:41.071
Sometimes,

31:42.521 --> 31:44.903
simple stuff in towns like that

31:45.869 --> 31:47.836
can complicate all of a sudden.

31:49.873 --> 31:53.922
So, how about we see if you can wrap
this thing up in a few days' time?

31:53.946 --> 31:55.820
I'll lend you my bass hunter.

31:55.844 --> 31:58.168
You can do yourselves
some fishing.

31:58.192 --> 32:00.929
Well, I will take
you up on your bet.

32:00.953 --> 32:02.586
And I will see you
day after next.

32:02.610 --> 32:03.956
Shoot.

32:05.302 --> 32:07.625
Better bring your lucky hat.

32:07.649 --> 32:09.099
Only thing that gives
me my balance.

33:06.950 --> 33:08.238
Is Jim in?

33:36.980 --> 33:38.785
Sorry, sir. You're not
supposed to be here.

33:38.809 --> 33:40.984
Hey, there. I'm Agent Hudson.

33:42.089 --> 33:43.756
With the SIB.

33:43.780 --> 33:46.955
Is this the residence
of a Lloyd Mickey?

33:47.715 --> 33:48.761
Yeah.

33:48.785 --> 33:50.225
Then I'm exactly
supposed to be here.

33:50.249 --> 33:51.492
It's a crime scene inside.

34:13.603 --> 34:16.132
What am I walking into?

34:16.157 --> 34:19.101
Well, sir, the victim's
a 70-year-old male.

34:19.126 --> 34:21.449
No next of kin. Um...

34:21.473 --> 34:24.554
There was a vehicle seen
leaving a few nights ago,

34:24.579 --> 34:27.341
and it matches the description
of a vehicle owned by

34:29.411 --> 34:30.837
Greg Broomfield.

34:30.860 --> 34:33.518
We're gonna see if we can
make any connection there.

34:35.107 --> 34:37.027
Well, it looks like the
place has been ransacked.

34:38.938 --> 34:41.123
Yes, we don't know
if that happened

34:41.148 --> 34:43.529
before or after the murder.

34:45.186 --> 34:49.856
It appears that anything that
could have been pulled and sold

34:49.880 --> 34:53.194
was, well, pulled and sold.

34:54.161 --> 34:55.541
After.

34:56.163 --> 34:57.278
Excuse me?

34:57.302 --> 34:59.027
Did you guys pull the body?

35:05.344 --> 35:06.494
Yes, sir.

35:06.518 --> 35:08.185
Well, did it happen
after he was killed,

35:08.209 --> 35:09.531
while the body was still he...

35:09.555 --> 35:10.729
Did you step in this?

35:14.733 --> 35:17.160
Because there is a
partial footprint

35:17.184 --> 35:18.989
at the top of the pool.

35:19.013 --> 35:22.372
And even if it was left there by
one of the officers investigating,

35:22.396 --> 35:24.788
I can't imagine they
would contaminate

35:24.812 --> 35:27.653
an already contaminated
crime scene any further

35:27.677 --> 35:30.173
by sprinkling any of the
plaster from the dry wall

35:30.197 --> 35:31.750
into the pool of blood.

35:34.028 --> 35:35.098
Come here.

35:42.174 --> 35:43.210
Come here.

35:47.075 --> 35:48.387
Sir, I just didn't realize...

35:49.181 --> 35:50.572
Fuck!

35:55.049 --> 35:56.060
Really?

35:58.086 --> 35:59.260
I'm... I'm sorry.

36:03.230 --> 36:04.576
I'm gonna go to the car.

36:08.614 --> 36:10.271
Is there anything I can do, sir?

36:12.929 --> 36:15.528
We witness the male shark
mate or give birth.

36:15.552 --> 36:17.668
Some would even go
so far as to say

36:17.692 --> 36:19.774
the whale shark is
a vessel to help

36:19.798 --> 36:23.364
the secrets of the deepest,
darkest places of our world

36:23.388 --> 36:25.538
stay secret.

36:25.562 --> 36:28.231
Although it is the
world's largest fish,

36:28.255 --> 36:30.222
growing up to 40 feet,
and weighing up to...

36:32.120 --> 36:36.239
I suppose I'd look pretty foolish
diving across the floor for that, huh?

36:36.263 --> 36:37.574
Yeah, I suppose you would.

36:39.231 --> 36:40.898
But that doesn't have to do

36:40.922 --> 36:42.717
with anything we have going on.

36:44.443 --> 36:45.548
I got delayed.

36:46.307 --> 36:47.377
Been here long?

36:48.275 --> 36:49.275
Is that it?

36:51.243 --> 36:53.048
There's ten in each box.

36:53.072 --> 36:54.384
Individually wrapped.

37:01.909 --> 37:03.369
I don't have to count these?

37:03.393 --> 37:05.982
You can. There's 20, no
matter who counts it.

37:07.466 --> 37:09.506
Julie Dewyn will be waiting
for you at Encino Wells.

37:16.924 --> 37:18.557
Forty thousand.

37:18.581 --> 37:19.581
Jim, is that blood?

37:20.583 --> 37:22.457
Arthur, there's
blood on all money.

37:22.481 --> 37:24.242
- You know what I mean.
- Then don't take it.

38:24.474 --> 38:25.796
Hello? Oh.

38:25.820 --> 38:27.270
Hello. Is Captain Riley here?

38:28.167 --> 38:29.386
And you are?

38:29.410 --> 38:31.688
I'm Agent Hudson, with the SIB.

38:32.931 --> 38:34.691
New Mexico State
Investigations Bureau.

38:36.590 --> 38:37.694
Up in Albuquerque.

38:44.011 --> 38:45.737
Captain Riley, SIB's here.

38:47.394 --> 38:49.233
Thank you, Jeane-Anne.

38:49.257 --> 38:51.432
Can I help you with
something, boy?

38:52.916 --> 38:54.411
Well, actually, I'm
here to help you.

38:54.435 --> 38:55.505
Boy.

39:00.407 --> 39:01.407
Inside.

39:05.446 --> 39:06.620
So you're the cavalry.

39:11.866 --> 39:12.971
That's some kind of hat.

39:14.731 --> 39:16.215
I'm some kind of cop.

39:21.428 --> 39:24.130
You gonna come down here

39:24.154 --> 39:27.064
and kick up a bunch of dust,
see where it all settles?

39:27.088 --> 39:28.618
Just hoping to solve a murder

39:28.642 --> 39:30.378
and head back from
whence I came.

39:30.402 --> 39:31.690
Oh.

39:31.714 --> 39:33.554
Is that all?

39:33.578 --> 39:36.453
Spoke with one of your
officers at the crime scene.

39:36.477 --> 39:38.938
You've already been
on my crime scene?

39:38.962 --> 39:40.457
Stopped by there on my way in.

39:40.481 --> 39:42.217
Hope you don't mind.

39:42.241 --> 39:44.461
And if I do?

39:44.485 --> 39:46.832
I insult you in some
way I'm unaware of?

39:47.902 --> 39:49.801
You being here insults me.

39:57.084 --> 40:00.822
I'm here, because you
aren't doing your job.

40:00.846 --> 40:03.446
I just left a crime scene
where one of your officers

40:03.470 --> 40:06.404
was literally lying
in a pool of blood.

40:07.784 --> 40:09.664
Now, I'm not sure how you
do things around here,

40:09.688 --> 40:11.281
but I'm starting
to get the idea.

40:11.305 --> 40:13.801
And the likelihood of
finding any usable evidence

40:13.825 --> 40:15.343
is faint at best.

40:18.139 --> 40:19.762
You're a piece of
shit, ain't you?

40:21.039 --> 40:22.454
At least I honor the badge.

40:26.769 --> 40:29.634
Come on. I wanna
show you something.

40:37.676 --> 40:39.205
What's going on here?

40:39.229 --> 40:40.344
Didn't you hear?

40:40.368 --> 40:41.311
What?

40:41.335 --> 40:43.347
Someone murdered Lloyd Mickey.

40:43.371 --> 40:44.371
What?

40:45.201 --> 40:47.524
- Lloyd?
- Yes.

40:47.548 --> 40:49.308
I never thought that
we'd have a murder here.

40:50.724 --> 40:52.598
How?

40:52.622 --> 40:57.189
Jeanne-Marie thinks that it has
something to do with the Irish mafia.

40:57.213 --> 40:59.053
That doesn't make any sense.

40:59.077 --> 41:00.779
What do you mean?

41:00.803 --> 41:03.885
Why would the Irish mob come to
Cardinal County to kill Lloyd?

41:03.909 --> 41:07.510
Well, you think it was someone
from Cardinal who killed him?

41:07.534 --> 41:09.063
That's not at all
what I'm saying.

41:09.087 --> 41:10.927
It's just that Irish mafia
killing Lloyd Mickey

41:10.951 --> 41:12.400
seems like a far stretch.

41:14.092 --> 41:15.403
You know it is, right?

41:16.197 --> 41:17.197
Yeah.

41:23.066 --> 41:24.630
So, why are we here?

41:24.654 --> 41:25.862
What do you see?

41:27.738 --> 41:28.738
What do you mean?

41:28.762 --> 41:30.729
What do you see?

41:32.697 --> 41:35.538
Houses, yards, trees.

41:35.562 --> 41:36.770
A community.

41:37.771 --> 41:39.403
All right.

41:39.427 --> 41:41.147
You don't see a lot of
these around anymore.

41:42.292 --> 41:44.374
What are you saying?

41:44.398 --> 41:46.928
What I'm saying is,
take it all in.

41:46.952 --> 41:49.690
This is all gonna change.

41:49.714 --> 41:52.209
Once people start thinking one
of their own is a murderer,

41:52.233 --> 41:54.591
all these front doors that
are open are gonna close.

41:54.615 --> 41:55.789
Blinds will be drawn.

41:58.861 --> 42:00.483
No more of that apple
pie in the air.

42:02.450 --> 42:03.693
End of Mayberry.

42:05.246 --> 42:06.776
You can joke about it,

42:06.800 --> 42:08.294
but the people here
like this place.

42:08.318 --> 42:09.917
They like being from here.

42:09.941 --> 42:11.563
It's a good place
with decent people.

42:13.858 --> 42:15.578
It was bad enough when
the scandal broke out

42:15.602 --> 42:17.752
when Lloyd Mickey got arrested.

42:17.776 --> 42:19.467
When he admitted to
being with that boy.

42:20.779 --> 42:22.712
How old was he, the kid?

42:23.264 --> 42:24.507
Fourteen.

42:26.302 --> 42:28.142
Lloyd said it was
a relationship.

42:28.166 --> 42:30.696
Tried to justify it.

42:30.720 --> 42:33.941
The things I had to do to
keep from drawing blood then.

42:33.965 --> 42:36.806
This town don't have child
molesters and murderers.

42:36.830 --> 42:39.418
People here never had to worry
about that kind of thing.

42:40.488 --> 42:42.008
Well, they don't have
to worry no more.

42:43.181 --> 42:44.607
We had a child molester.

42:44.631 --> 42:45.987
He got killed.

42:46.011 --> 42:47.565
Now we don't have
a child molester.

42:48.807 --> 42:51.406
So that's the way you see it?

42:51.430 --> 42:53.590
I reckon that's how all the
town folks see it, so yeah.

42:53.614 --> 42:55.202
Yeah, that's how I see it.

42:57.471 --> 42:58.955
Did you kill Lloyd Mickey?

43:01.648 --> 43:02.959
Fuck you.

43:04.823 --> 43:07.183
Are you gonna get in the way of
me investigating this thing?

43:08.655 --> 43:09.977
Nah.

43:10.001 --> 43:12.001
Can't say I'm gonna be of
much help to you neither.

43:12.866 --> 43:14.384
I can work with that.

43:50.697 --> 43:52.181
I like how you're handy.

43:54.217 --> 43:56.230
I didn't mean it like that.

43:56.254 --> 43:58.577
How you fix things around here.

43:58.601 --> 44:00.154
Not like in my house. Ugh!

44:01.017 --> 44:02.477
Ron doesn't do anything.

44:02.501 --> 44:04.341
Everything is broken
and falling apart,

44:04.365 --> 44:05.688
just like him.

44:05.712 --> 44:07.592
I can't even stand to be
there most of the time.

44:10.095 --> 44:11.095
I'm sorry to hear that.

44:12.546 --> 44:13.581
Are you?

44:15.376 --> 44:17.596
I can't believe we've known
each other all these years

44:17.620 --> 44:20.002
and yet we haven't known
each other at all.

44:20.761 --> 44:21.762
Yeah.

44:24.351 --> 44:26.249
We should go away
somewhere, you and me.

44:28.873 --> 44:30.012
Where do you wanna go?

44:31.082 --> 44:33.888
Ah! I don't know.

44:33.912 --> 44:35.338
I've always wanted
to go to Greece.

44:35.362 --> 44:36.719
Oh, and Egypt.

44:36.743 --> 44:37.823
Egypt?

44:37.847 --> 44:39.366
- Have you been?
- Mmm. No.

44:40.712 --> 44:43.691
I noticed that Alaska key
chain that you have.

44:43.715 --> 44:45.451
What was that like?

44:45.475 --> 44:47.626
I don't know. Never been.

44:47.650 --> 44:49.100
Oh. So, why do you have it?

44:51.550 --> 44:53.350
I always wanted to go,
ever since I was a kid.

44:54.864 --> 44:57.024
Arthur and I have been talking
about going for a while,

44:57.048 --> 45:00.225
but how busy we've been
with the funeral home

45:00.249 --> 45:01.467
and with him being mayor.

45:01.491 --> 45:03.090
I don't know when
we'll get the chance.

45:03.114 --> 45:05.254
Mmm. Well, why don't you
just go by yourself?

45:07.290 --> 45:08.636
Without Arthur?

45:11.743 --> 45:13.445
Nah, I couldn't.

45:13.469 --> 45:14.677
Why not?

45:15.678 --> 45:16.955
Be your own man.

45:17.991 --> 45:19.796
I see you two together
all the time,

45:19.820 --> 45:22.305
but you're the one who's
doing everything.

45:23.513 --> 45:26.285
Like, you're here now.

45:26.309 --> 45:28.415
You practically run the place.

45:29.278 --> 45:30.693
You're not some errand boy.

45:32.350 --> 45:33.523
I'm not an errand boy.

45:35.525 --> 45:36.734
I know.

45:38.908 --> 45:40.738
I wouldn't like you
so much if you were.

46:10.802 --> 46:11.802
Hey, Arthur.

46:12.735 --> 46:14.092
Everything okay?

46:14.116 --> 46:16.025
I'm fine. Have you seen Vincent?

46:16.049 --> 46:17.026
I saw him earlier.

46:17.050 --> 46:18.613
Oh, your brother's in the back.

46:18.637 --> 46:19.757
He's working on the freezer.

46:22.849 --> 46:26.863
I like fancy, colorful earrings.

46:26.887 --> 46:28.934
- Oh.
- Oh, hey, Arthur.

46:28.958 --> 46:30.108
I'm gonna go, um...

46:30.132 --> 46:32.110
I'm gonna finish up outside.
Hi, Arthur.

46:32.134 --> 46:33.238
Hey, there, Connie.

46:35.033 --> 46:36.863
I'm glad you're here.
I got news.

46:38.002 --> 46:40.694
Uh... Lloyd's dead.

46:41.764 --> 46:43.041
Police found him this morning.

46:44.422 --> 46:46.987
How did it happen?

46:47.011 --> 46:48.678
He was shot in the head.

46:48.702 --> 46:52.026
They don't know if he did it,
or if it was someone else.

46:52.050 --> 46:54.130
The place looked ransacked,
like maybe it was robbed.

46:54.154 --> 46:55.858
But that could have been after.

46:55.882 --> 46:58.022
I tried to call you, but
you went to voicemail.

47:00.887 --> 47:02.198
Arthur, this is a good thing.

47:03.234 --> 47:04.338
We're in the clear.

47:05.408 --> 47:06.547
Alaska, right?

47:10.206 --> 47:11.690
He was the only
thing in the way.

47:13.692 --> 47:15.625
Let's take this outside.
Come on.

47:22.046 --> 47:24.334
Why do we have to wait? There's
nothing keeping us here.

47:24.358 --> 47:27.337
You really need to think about
what you say sometimes.

47:27.361 --> 47:30.582
If we left right now, we would
look guilty of something.

47:30.606 --> 47:33.067
And please, keep
your voice down.

47:33.091 --> 47:35.380
What, are you afraid
what people will think?

47:35.404 --> 47:37.451
Vincent, we were
just over there.

47:37.475 --> 47:40.523
Of course, I'm afraid about
what people will think.

47:40.547 --> 47:42.076
Nobody knows we were over there.

47:42.100 --> 47:44.020
Nobody knows about Lloyd's money.
How could they?

47:45.932 --> 47:47.944
Arthur, if you're
serious about this,

47:47.968 --> 47:51.085
we should go and make whatever deal
we can for, you know, the stuff.

47:51.109 --> 47:52.431
I am serious about this.

47:52.455 --> 47:54.640
I unloaded some of
the coins today.

47:54.664 --> 47:56.780
- To who?
- You don't wanna know that.

47:56.804 --> 47:58.955
I'll take care of it,
like I always do.

47:58.979 --> 48:00.923
No, you've always been
the one with the vision,

48:00.947 --> 48:03.649
and I'm just supposed to stay blind?
Is that it?

48:03.673 --> 48:06.411
Vincent, I have
it under control.

48:06.435 --> 48:10.415
Please, you just
have to trust me.

48:10.439 --> 48:12.165
Just like Lloyd was
supposed to trust you?

48:13.131 --> 48:14.902
He ended up dead.

48:14.926 --> 48:16.835
And he never got
his money, did he?

48:59.212 --> 49:01.317
- You want me to
get you something?

49:02.732 --> 49:03.837
You Greg, right?

49:05.287 --> 49:06.712
Yeah.

49:06.736 --> 49:08.946
Well, Greg, I'll take
an Arnold Palmer.

49:09.670 --> 49:10.854
A what?

49:10.878 --> 49:13.202
We don't got those here.

49:13.226 --> 49:15.507
How about I just get an iced
tea with some lemonade in it?

49:29.828 --> 49:31.037
You got a problem, mister?

49:32.521 --> 49:34.292
No problem. No, no.

49:34.316 --> 49:36.190
Not me.

49:36.214 --> 49:38.014
Looks like you got yourself
a boyfriend, Greg.

49:41.180 --> 49:44.060
You don't look like you're from around
here, so you should probably know.

49:44.084 --> 49:46.338
They already found one
dead faggot in town today.

49:46.362 --> 49:48.082
It'll be a real shame
if they found another.

49:50.228 --> 49:51.954
- Who, me?
- Yeah, you.

49:54.922 --> 49:57.856
Well, I certainly didn't
come here for any trouble.

49:59.720 --> 50:00.894
How much I owe you?

50:03.793 --> 50:04.898
This good?

50:09.765 --> 50:11.111
Keep the change, Greg.

50:42.315 --> 50:43.706
What you got there, Greg?

50:43.730 --> 50:44.914
How'd you get...

50:44.938 --> 50:46.767
And what's this you said
about a dead faggot?

51:10.032 --> 51:13.484
You move, and I will drop you and
sleep just fine about it tonight.

51:15.520 --> 51:17.498
Now, you gonna tell
me what you know,

51:17.522 --> 51:19.593
and I don't want you
to skip any details.

51:26.945 --> 51:28.361
What's going on?

51:34.332 --> 51:35.654
I'm gonna call the Captain.

51:35.678 --> 51:36.678
Good.

51:47.173 --> 51:48.633
Hello.

51:48.657 --> 51:50.777
I told you, you're not supposed
to be using the phone.

51:51.292 --> 51:52.292
Yeah, it's me.

51:52.316 --> 51:54.214
Orlando, you got a
woman with you?

51:56.699 --> 51:58.470
Yeah.

51:58.494 --> 51:59.885
How's it going down there?

51:59.909 --> 52:02.543
Well, that's why I
was calling you.

52:02.567 --> 52:05.225
I brought someone in, threw
a jar of gold teeth at me.

52:05.984 --> 52:08.170
Well, that's peculiar.

52:08.194 --> 52:10.482
Don't think I've come
across one like that.

52:10.506 --> 52:11.794
Are you listening to me?

52:11.818 --> 52:14.176
I called Captain Riley and
I left him a message.

52:14.200 --> 52:16.350
Hold on, sir.

52:16.374 --> 52:18.041
What's your name? Jeane-Anne?

52:18.065 --> 52:19.560
Yeah.

52:19.584 --> 52:22.977
Officer Jeane-Anne, I
do not discriminate.

52:23.001 --> 52:24.393
So, if I should get up,

52:24.417 --> 52:27.223
I'm going to hit you, like
I would any other officer.

52:27.247 --> 52:29.398
It will be very hard,
and it will hurt.

52:29.422 --> 52:30.709
A lot.

52:30.733 --> 52:32.366
And then, I'm gonna
sit back down here

52:32.390 --> 52:34.023
and finish with this phone call.

52:34.047 --> 52:35.082
So, what do you say?

52:35.911 --> 52:37.154
Uh...

52:38.534 --> 52:40.571
I'm gonna go check
on the prisoner.

52:41.227 --> 52:42.607
Thank you, Jeane-Anne.

52:43.539 --> 52:44.999
Sorry about that.

52:45.023 --> 52:46.380
What was that about?

52:46.404 --> 52:49.349
Well, the local station ain't
all that accomodating.

52:49.373 --> 52:52.893
Oh. I figured that
might be the case.

52:54.205 --> 52:56.252
Are you poking a
beehive down there?

52:56.276 --> 52:57.598
Absolutely.

52:57.622 --> 53:01.430
Well, just don't get
stung too much.

53:01.454 --> 53:03.180
Come on, Maitlyn, you can do it.

53:08.254 --> 53:11.129
I gotta put my shoes back on.

53:11.153 --> 53:13.914
Just do what you gotta do,
then come on back home.

53:14.570 --> 53:15.570
Okay.

53:28.274 --> 53:29.965
Isn't Ron gonna ask you
where you've been?

53:30.379 --> 53:31.553
He might.

53:33.589 --> 53:34.728
What would you say?

53:35.833 --> 53:37.397
It's none of his business.

53:37.421 --> 53:38.836
Why, you worried?

53:40.182 --> 53:41.287
No.

53:44.255 --> 53:47.085
What would you say if you were
gonna be away longer than a night?

53:49.743 --> 53:50.951
Like how long?

53:51.297 --> 53:52.470
Mmm...

53:54.645 --> 53:56.992
As long as it takes
to go to Alaska.

54:00.167 --> 54:02.284
Oh, Vincent.

54:02.308 --> 54:05.010
You don't have to start saying
things that you don't mean.

54:05.034 --> 54:06.484
We just fucked, that's all.

54:38.999 --> 54:40.242
Sorry.

54:55.395 --> 54:56.683
Excuse me.

54:56.707 --> 54:58.295
Any chance you could
break a five?

55:04.197 --> 55:05.371
Keep it.

55:06.199 --> 55:07.338
Thank you.

55:32.708 --> 55:35.066
Hi, you've reached Vincent
Herring's Funeral Home.

55:35.090 --> 55:36.436
Please leave a message.

56:50.476 --> 56:53.558
All right We have a
72-year-old male,

56:53.582 --> 56:55.757
single GSW to the
back of the head.

57:03.661 --> 57:05.121
You see that?

57:05.145 --> 57:07.607
That is more than
likely from a .22.

57:07.631 --> 57:10.920
Uh, no slugs or casings were
found at the crime scene.

57:10.944 --> 57:13.302
Casings are easy to
pick up off the ground.

57:13.326 --> 57:14.948
The slug is a bit of
a different story.

57:15.811 --> 57:18.227
See that? No exit wound.

57:18.987 --> 57:20.482
I just assumed that the...

57:20.506 --> 57:22.967
Most people do. Was
there a lot of blood?

57:22.991 --> 57:24.209
Yeah.

57:24.233 --> 57:26.384
More than likely discharged
orally or nasally.

57:26.408 --> 57:29.007
So you're saying the
bullet's still in his head?

57:29.031 --> 57:31.389
- Yes.
- Well, great.

57:31.413 --> 57:33.184
Let's pull it for ballistics.

57:33.208 --> 57:36.325
That bullet rattled and bounced
around so much in that man's skull,

57:36.349 --> 57:39.248
it would be virtually impossible
to get any information from it.

57:40.387 --> 57:42.055
What about anything else?

57:42.079 --> 57:43.805
Signs of struggle, ligature?

57:44.357 --> 57:45.955
Sorry.

57:45.979 --> 57:47.809
- Thanks anyway.
- No problem.

57:49.057 --> 57:50.857
Oh, yeah. There are some
personal items of his

57:50.881 --> 57:52.341
over on that table.

57:52.365 --> 57:54.136
His wallet, a key.

57:54.160 --> 57:55.800
The police forgot to
pick them up earlier.

57:56.265 --> 57:57.266
Thank you.

58:17.942 --> 58:19.541
Where have you been?

58:19.565 --> 58:21.232
We still have two pickups,

58:21.256 --> 58:23.924
and three bodies to prep.

58:23.948 --> 58:26.444
Not including Mr. Newsham here.

58:26.468 --> 58:28.021
I wanna know who you
sold the coins to.

58:29.298 --> 58:30.552
What?

58:30.576 --> 58:31.863
You said we're in this together.

58:31.887 --> 58:33.727
You sold the coins, and
half of them are mine.

58:33.751 --> 58:35.071
I wanna know who
you sold them to.

58:37.721 --> 58:38.894
Your half?

58:41.034 --> 58:42.449
Where is this all coming from?

58:43.312 --> 58:45.290
Not Alaska.

58:45.314 --> 58:47.109
Is that what this is all about?
Alaska?

58:48.214 --> 58:50.192
I said we would go.

58:50.216 --> 58:52.366
You said a lot of things.

58:52.390 --> 58:55.083
But all I see is you digging
in deeper right where you are.

58:56.256 --> 58:59.201
I'm doing all of this for us.

58:59.225 --> 59:00.640
This is your Alaska.

59:01.503 --> 59:03.032
This.

59:03.056 --> 59:04.230
This is your Alaska.

59:06.991 --> 59:08.969
I didn't realize it
for the longest time.

59:08.993 --> 59:11.040
This is paradise for
you here, Arthur.

59:11.064 --> 59:12.490
You have everything
you ever wanted.

59:12.514 --> 59:14.803
Businesses, you got the cars.

59:14.827 --> 59:16.553
You're a fucking mayor,
for Christ's sake.

59:18.347 --> 59:19.832
This whole time you've been

59:20.729 --> 59:22.120
digging in,

59:22.144 --> 59:23.629
and I didn't realize it.

59:25.251 --> 59:26.987
You've just been putting me on.

59:27.011 --> 59:28.185
Just so I would stay.

59:28.979 --> 59:29.980
Hello?

59:31.740 --> 59:32.740
Who's that?

59:33.362 --> 59:34.362
Hello?

59:34.847 --> 59:35.951
I don't know.

59:37.090 --> 59:38.782
I'm not expecting anybody.

59:41.681 --> 59:43.165
You tell me who your fence is.

59:44.132 --> 59:46.479
- Just wait.
- I'm done waiting.

59:51.622 --> 59:52.796
Coyote Jim.

59:53.348 --> 59:54.383
Up in Elkhorn.

59:57.870 --> 59:58.974
Now wait.

01:00:11.055 --> 01:00:12.332
Can I help you?

01:00:14.231 --> 01:00:15.829
I hope so.

01:00:15.853 --> 01:00:17.935
I'm Agent Hudson with the SIB.

01:00:17.959 --> 01:00:19.971
Just have a few
questions to ask you.

01:00:19.995 --> 01:00:21.801
Me?

01:00:21.825 --> 01:00:23.457
I hope I'm not in trouble.

01:00:23.481 --> 01:00:24.897
Trouble? Why would you be?

01:00:27.071 --> 01:00:30.326
I just have a few general questions
about a case I'm working on.

01:00:30.350 --> 01:00:31.950
Thought you might be
able to help me out.

01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:37.495
Hey, you're the guy
with the loose change.

01:00:38.496 --> 01:00:40.129
Hi.

01:00:40.153 --> 01:00:41.845
I'm gonna go to the restaurant.

01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:50.001
Would you mind if I
work while we talk?

01:00:50.025 --> 01:00:51.717
See, we're pretty far behind.

01:00:55.548 --> 01:00:57.757
I bet you wanna ask me
about Lloyd Mickey.

01:00:59.448 --> 01:01:01.002
Now, how'd you guess that?

01:01:02.555 --> 01:01:04.878
I can't think of any other
reason why a state investigator

01:01:04.902 --> 01:01:06.846
would be interested

01:01:06.870 --> 01:01:09.251
in coming all the way
here to Cardinal County.

01:01:10.218 --> 01:01:11.540
So you knew him?

01:01:11.564 --> 01:01:12.714
Yes, I did.

01:01:12.738 --> 01:01:13.946
He was a friend.

01:01:15.361 --> 01:01:16.683
It's also a small town

01:01:16.707 --> 01:01:19.123
and he was the only other
mortician in the county.

01:01:19.952 --> 01:01:21.239
The competition.

01:01:21.263 --> 01:01:22.862
Oh, no, no, no.

01:01:22.886 --> 01:01:24.277
Nothing like that.

01:01:24.301 --> 01:01:27.867
We referred work to one another.

01:01:27.891 --> 01:01:30.939
Man, I talked to a whole
lot of folks here.

01:01:30.963 --> 01:01:32.906
I have to say, I'd
be hard-pressed

01:01:32.930 --> 01:01:35.070
to find anybody admit to
being friends with the man.

01:01:35.726 --> 01:01:37.877
A place like this,

01:01:37.901 --> 01:01:41.042
he certainly wasn't the
most popular person.

01:01:41.594 --> 01:01:42.802
Unlike you.

01:01:43.423 --> 01:01:44.918
Excuse me?

01:01:44.942 --> 01:01:46.402
Well, they tell me
you're a mayor.

01:01:46.426 --> 01:01:48.256
You at least have to
be a little popular.

01:01:49.671 --> 01:01:53.399
Actually, I'm a priest
in the town, too.

01:01:54.503 --> 01:01:55.504
No kidding!

01:02:02.304 --> 01:02:04.134
I need to talk to you.

01:02:09.484 --> 01:02:10.668
Come away with me.

01:02:10.692 --> 01:02:12.325
- What?
- I mean it.

01:02:12.349 --> 01:02:15.086
Ron doesn't deserve
you, and I think I do.

01:02:15.110 --> 01:02:17.261
We can start something
special together.

01:02:17.285 --> 01:02:20.081
- Vincent, I can't...
- I ain't taking no for an answer.

01:02:21.254 --> 01:02:23.301
I've been taking
no's all my life.

01:02:23.325 --> 01:02:25.534
- I don't know what to say.
- Say you'll come.

01:02:26.673 --> 01:02:28.237
You can't just up and leave.

01:02:28.261 --> 01:02:29.652
We have lives.

01:02:29.676 --> 01:02:31.585
Sure we can. We don't
even need to pack.

01:02:31.609 --> 01:02:33.760
Just take what we have
on our backs and go.

01:02:33.784 --> 01:02:36.487
It sounds like we're running
away from something.

01:02:36.511 --> 01:02:37.823
We're running to something.

01:02:38.858 --> 01:02:39.963
Together.

01:02:40.687 --> 01:02:41.768
Are you serious?

01:02:41.792 --> 01:02:43.287
Heck, yeah, I am.

01:02:43.311 --> 01:02:44.312
This is crazy.

01:02:44.830 --> 01:02:46.038
It's crazy.

01:02:46.486 --> 01:02:47.487
Mmm.

01:02:48.385 --> 01:02:50.628
- Let's go.
- Okay. Oh, God.

01:02:58.326 --> 01:03:01.132
- Gold teeth.
- What about them?

01:03:01.156 --> 01:03:02.720
Any reason Lloyd Mickey
would have them?

01:03:02.744 --> 01:03:05.160
Oh, it's common for a mortician.

01:03:12.374 --> 01:03:13.410
Sometimes, uh...

01:03:14.894 --> 01:03:17.794
People will choose
to donate gold,

01:03:18.656 --> 01:03:20.072
or silver fillings,

01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:23.016
things like that.

01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:26.147
I can't think that they
would be worth much.

01:03:26.768 --> 01:03:27.838
Over time,

01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:30.358
if you have enough of them...

01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:33.499
It's interesting, really,

01:03:34.776 --> 01:03:37.675
the human body, what
people do to it.

01:03:38.504 --> 01:03:40.585
When you drain the body,

01:03:40.609 --> 01:03:42.829
you end up finding tattoos,

01:03:42.853 --> 01:03:45.073
piercing, stuff like that.

01:03:45.097 --> 01:03:46.374
Sometimes it's more.

01:03:47.409 --> 01:03:49.032
It's like a secret
treasure chest.

01:03:50.412 --> 01:03:54.175
It made me think completely
differently about this.

01:03:55.383 --> 01:03:57.937
Like maybe

01:03:59.456 --> 01:04:01.044
I'm a vessel to help

01:04:02.528 --> 01:04:05.531
some secrets stay secret.

01:04:06.187 --> 01:04:07.187
Hmm.

01:04:10.708 --> 01:04:11.709
Was there anything else?

01:04:13.642 --> 01:04:15.103
Trying to get rid of me?

01:04:15.127 --> 01:04:16.759
I am.

01:04:16.783 --> 01:04:19.038
It's just that, uh,

01:04:19.062 --> 01:04:23.456
I'm going to start embalming Mr.
Newsham here,

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:25.768
and I really can't
be distracted.

01:04:25.792 --> 01:04:27.598
It's the difference between

01:04:27.622 --> 01:04:31.143
an open casket and
a closed casket.

01:04:31.902 --> 01:04:32.902
Hmm.

01:04:35.837 --> 01:04:37.149
You gonna get it?

01:04:37.908 --> 01:04:38.978
No.

01:04:39.979 --> 01:04:42.785
It's him. I know it's him.

01:04:42.809 --> 01:04:44.960
Aren't you gonna go in
and grab your stuff?

01:04:44.984 --> 01:04:45.984
Yeah.

01:04:47.607 --> 01:04:48.967
Do you want me to
go in and get it?

01:04:49.402 --> 01:04:50.586
No.

01:04:50.610 --> 01:04:51.922
I don't see a car.

01:04:54.476 --> 01:04:56.385
What is it with you two?

01:04:56.409 --> 01:04:57.662
What do you mean?

01:04:57.686 --> 01:04:59.561
You're the strangest
brothers I've ever met.

01:04:59.585 --> 01:05:00.785
It's like you're not brothers.

01:05:08.525 --> 01:05:09.836
What are you saying?

01:05:11.597 --> 01:05:12.701
Connie...

01:05:14.945 --> 01:05:15.981
Oh, my God.

01:05:16.326 --> 01:05:17.326
Oh...

01:05:18.328 --> 01:05:20.444
You and Arthur...

01:05:20.468 --> 01:05:21.538
No, it's not...

01:05:23.989 --> 01:05:25.335
I wanted to tell you.

01:05:27.026 --> 01:05:28.624
Babe...

01:05:28.648 --> 01:05:30.133
It doesn't bother me.

01:05:31.375 --> 01:05:33.836
It's me and you now.

01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:36.080
You don't have to go in
there if you don't want.

01:05:36.104 --> 01:05:37.288
It's okay.

01:05:37.312 --> 01:05:39.290
It's not. It's not okay.

01:05:39.314 --> 01:05:41.189
We're supposed to be partners,

01:05:41.213 --> 01:05:42.697
but it's like he's
holding me hostage.

01:05:44.630 --> 01:05:46.563
We need that stuff if
we're gonna go anywhere.

01:05:48.116 --> 01:05:49.783
He's got money hidden
all over the place.

01:05:49.807 --> 01:05:52.810
But all I know is that he
has our ticket out of here

01:05:53.742 --> 01:05:54.812
right inside.

01:06:28.536 --> 01:06:30.341
Have you seen Vincent?

01:06:30.365 --> 01:06:33.482
Ugh. He was here earlier.
I think he left.

01:06:33.506 --> 01:06:35.346
Ashley, what's wrong?

01:06:35.370 --> 01:06:38.246
Deidre called in sick, and
Connie just walked out.

01:06:38.270 --> 01:06:40.375
- Connie quit?
- I guess so.

01:06:58.393 --> 01:06:59.394
Hello.

01:07:02.087 --> 01:07:04.192
Is this Lloyd Mickey's
funeral home?

01:07:05.090 --> 01:07:07.068
You're not a reporter, are you?

01:07:07.092 --> 01:07:09.760
No, Ma'am. I'm not.

01:07:09.784 --> 01:07:12.245
Some of those people, they'll
print anything on a whisper,

01:07:12.269 --> 01:07:14.765
as long as it'll sell
more of their papers.

01:07:14.789 --> 01:07:18.251
I tell 'em all, I ain't
got nothing to say.

01:07:18.275 --> 01:07:21.082
They couldn't care less about
printing anything that even rhymes,

01:07:21.106 --> 01:07:22.566
but the truth.

01:07:25.213 --> 01:07:26.984
Who are you?

01:07:27.008 --> 01:07:30.253
Well, I'm looking for something
that rhymes with the truth.

01:07:32.772 --> 01:07:33.772
May I?

01:08:24.064 --> 01:08:25.283
Was he...

01:08:25.308 --> 01:08:26.999
I'm sorry, ma'am.
Your name, please?

01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:28.631
Dolores.

01:08:28.656 --> 01:08:30.185
Well, Dolores, was
he in here long?

01:08:30.209 --> 01:08:33.292
No. He just came by
to check the mail.

01:08:33.316 --> 01:08:34.671
Actually, I was surprised,

01:08:34.696 --> 01:08:36.904
considering all the things
that he had to tend to.

01:08:38.183 --> 01:08:39.988
So he checked his mail.
Is that it?

01:08:40.011 --> 01:08:41.013
Mmm-hmm.

01:08:42.808 --> 01:08:43.912
Did he check his safe?

01:08:45.362 --> 01:08:46.569
I wouldn't know.

01:09:12.182 --> 01:09:14.022
I'll let you know if I
have any more questions.

01:09:35.067 --> 01:09:36.734
Dolores?

01:09:36.758 --> 01:09:38.080
It's empty, Dolores.

01:09:38.104 --> 01:09:40.013
Nothing's in here.

01:09:40.037 --> 01:09:42.774
It can't be empty. He owes me!

01:09:42.799 --> 01:09:43.800
Dolores?

01:09:45.145 --> 01:09:47.113
Dolores, let me see your hands.

01:09:49.599 --> 01:09:50.876
Your hands, Dolores.

01:09:57.607 --> 01:10:01.127
Dolores, were you about to crack me across
the skull with that metal fire poker?

01:10:04.993 --> 01:10:06.961
Come on, grab your purse.

01:10:21.078 --> 01:10:22.918
I got a bone to pick with you.

01:10:22.942 --> 01:10:24.610
Hey, Sam. What brings
you down here?

01:10:24.634 --> 01:10:26.163
Don't you, "Hey, Sam," me.

01:10:26.187 --> 01:10:27.647
Hold it there, Sam.
What's wrong?

01:10:27.671 --> 01:10:29.546
You got Dolores locked
up in that jail

01:10:29.570 --> 01:10:31.606
like a common criminal,
that's what's wrong.

01:10:32.331 --> 01:10:33.722
- Dolores?
- Dolores!

01:10:33.746 --> 01:10:35.231
- Locked up?
- Locked up.

01:10:37.612 --> 01:10:39.580
Sam, stay here. I'll
take care of it.

01:10:41.996 --> 01:10:43.594
- Where is he?
- Holding room one.

01:10:43.618 --> 01:10:44.664
Our son is in there.

01:10:44.688 --> 01:10:46.287
- This is unheard-of.
- I know.

01:10:46.311 --> 01:10:47.736
Okay, calm down. Okay.

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:49.175
I'll take care of it.

01:10:50.004 --> 01:10:52.258
- Sir...
- I know.

01:10:52.282 --> 01:10:54.295
You see, I really don't care.

01:10:54.319 --> 01:10:57.356
I will keep you here until
I'm satisfied that...

01:10:59.324 --> 01:11:00.646
What are you doing?

01:11:00.670 --> 01:11:02.534
I'm questioning a suspect.

01:11:04.363 --> 01:11:06.883
He ain't a suspect.
He's just a nitwit.

01:11:11.370 --> 01:11:12.416
Did you choke him?

01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:14.546
Yeah. He threw a
mason jar at me.

01:11:17.307 --> 01:11:18.940
I reckon you deserved that.

01:11:18.964 --> 01:11:20.345
Did you apologize?

01:11:21.898 --> 01:11:22.968
I'm sorry.

01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:26.223
See? There you go.

01:11:26.247 --> 01:11:29.226
He had pulled building
materials in his apartment.

01:11:29.250 --> 01:11:30.848
Oh, Christ. That's how he is.

01:11:30.872 --> 01:11:33.112
He's been pulling stuff out
of houses since he was a kid.

01:11:33.910 --> 01:11:35.567
- Look, Officer...
- Deputy.

01:11:37.638 --> 01:11:39.132
I can't have you
coming into town

01:11:39.156 --> 01:11:40.824
and locking town folk
up, creating a...

01:11:40.848 --> 01:11:44.310
Suspects. They are suspects.

01:11:44.334 --> 01:11:47.658
Look, this small town way of crime
solving just ain't gonna cut it.

01:11:47.682 --> 01:11:50.385
Now, there was a
real murder here.

01:11:50.409 --> 01:11:53.129
And it looks like I'm the only one
trying to get to the bottom of it.

01:11:54.517 --> 01:11:56.519
Greg, have you asked
for an attorney?

01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:59.325
What, sir?

01:11:59.349 --> 01:12:00.349
Are you kidding me?

01:12:00.937 --> 01:12:02.076
Ask for an attorney.

01:12:03.664 --> 01:12:05.044
I can't afford an attorney.

01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:07.046
Just ask.

01:12:09.394 --> 01:12:10.498
Can I have an attorney?

01:12:25.686 --> 01:12:26.790
What did you do?

01:12:28.620 --> 01:12:30.967
I stripped Lloyd Mickey's
house, that's all.

01:12:32.037 --> 01:12:33.107
Was he dead?

01:12:34.315 --> 01:12:35.913
Yes.

01:12:35.937 --> 01:12:37.353
You better not be lying to me.

01:12:45.464 --> 01:12:46.810
Hey. Hey.

01:12:49.572 --> 01:12:51.412
What do you think
you're doing in there?

01:12:51.436 --> 01:12:54.311
Me? I'd be right in asking
you the same thing.

01:12:54.335 --> 01:12:56.244
I am trying to solve a murder.

01:12:56.268 --> 01:12:58.695
And those two are the only ones that
know anything worth a damn about it.

01:12:58.719 --> 01:13:00.731
Now, I'm gonna follow this
thing wherever it goes,

01:13:00.755 --> 01:13:02.284
to whoever it goes.

01:13:02.308 --> 01:13:04.114
I don't care what I turn up,

01:13:04.138 --> 01:13:05.588
as long as it's the truth.

01:13:06.761 --> 01:13:07.762
Why them?

01:13:10.075 --> 01:13:11.570
Gold teeth.

01:13:11.594 --> 01:13:14.952
Gold teeth? What does that mean?

01:13:14.976 --> 01:13:17.254
The jar Greg threw at me
had gold teeth in it.

01:13:17.979 --> 01:13:19.612
Okay.

01:13:19.636 --> 01:13:21.165
What about Dolores?

01:13:21.189 --> 01:13:22.719
Dolores had a gold tooth on her

01:13:22.743 --> 01:13:23.961
in Lloyd Mickey's office

01:13:23.985 --> 01:13:25.665
when she was planning
on bashing my head in

01:13:25.689 --> 01:13:27.309
with a metal fire poke.

01:13:27.333 --> 01:13:29.104
She had been trying
to get into his safe

01:13:29.128 --> 01:13:30.658
since the day he went to jail.

01:13:30.682 --> 01:13:32.729
She thought it was
a small fortune.

01:13:32.753 --> 01:13:34.789
- Was it?
- Not a damn thing.

01:13:36.584 --> 01:13:38.804
I'll keep her here for
another 20 minutes.

01:13:38.828 --> 01:13:41.979
Then I'll bring her a crawler and
I'll become the Jesus with that.

01:13:42.003 --> 01:13:43.522
See what I can find out for you.

01:13:44.937 --> 01:13:46.294
And the bartender?

01:13:46.318 --> 01:13:48.917
Greg? He ain't your guy.

01:13:48.941 --> 01:13:50.574
But he is a suspect in this.

01:13:50.598 --> 01:13:52.680
If you suspected him of

01:13:52.704 --> 01:13:55.130
being a piece of shit, I'd
say you got your man.

01:13:55.154 --> 01:13:57.514
But he ain't nothing more than
a lowlife trying to stay low.

01:13:58.503 --> 01:14:00.342
What about the jar
of gold teeth?

01:14:00.366 --> 01:14:02.366
He said he grabbed it the
night he dropped him off,

01:14:02.390 --> 01:14:04.174
after Lloyd made
an advance on him.

01:14:04.198 --> 01:14:06.763
Said he socked him, took
the jar, and ran out.

01:14:06.787 --> 01:14:07.960
Nothing more than that.

01:14:09.203 --> 01:14:10.801
Now, we could keep
him here for a bit,

01:14:10.825 --> 01:14:12.320
for throwing something
at your head,

01:14:12.344 --> 01:14:14.495
breaking and entering,
stealing...

01:14:14.519 --> 01:14:16.531
But that's about all
we gonna get on him.

01:14:16.555 --> 01:14:18.947
What about the night
of the murder?

01:14:18.971 --> 01:14:22.458
Five cars stood. Bill Tuney,
Dave Francis and Bob West.

01:14:24.011 --> 01:14:27.404
Turns out I ain't just some
small town hick police chief.

01:14:27.428 --> 01:14:29.395
I just know not to kick
a turd on a hot day.

01:14:30.569 --> 01:14:32.049
I guess I hadn't
learned that one yet.

01:14:34.021 --> 01:14:36.137
There's only one way this
evidence is pointing,

01:14:36.161 --> 01:14:37.321
and you're not gonna like it.

01:14:38.715 --> 01:14:40.199
Vincent and Arthur Herring.

01:14:41.856 --> 01:14:43.444
Christ! The mayor?

01:14:45.584 --> 01:14:47.976
See, this... This is what
I'm talking about here.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.520
You got two people
in the holding cell,

01:14:49.544 --> 01:14:50.876
now you're going
after the mayor.

01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:53.534
I gotta live here. I
don't need any of this.

01:14:53.558 --> 01:14:55.007
Well, this is gonna happen.

01:14:56.733 --> 01:14:58.918
Do what you gotta do.

01:14:58.942 --> 01:15:00.875
Just stop filling up
my police station.

01:15:06.847 --> 01:15:09.263
A box of coins and a
jar of gold teeth?

01:15:10.022 --> 01:15:11.679
That... That's your plan?

01:15:12.577 --> 01:15:14.209
You don't understand.

01:15:14.233 --> 01:15:16.695
No, I do understand.

01:15:16.719 --> 01:15:19.387
You want me to run
away from my family

01:15:19.411 --> 01:15:21.793
with a pocket full
of magic beans?

01:15:22.552 --> 01:15:23.909
I told you.

01:15:23.933 --> 01:15:26.038
I can drive out there first
thing in the morning.

01:15:27.557 --> 01:15:29.086
This is expensive stuff.

01:15:29.110 --> 01:15:31.710
And what, he's just gonna give
you money, just like that?

01:15:31.734 --> 01:15:33.574
Starting over kind of money?

01:15:33.598 --> 01:15:34.702
Yes.

01:15:35.807 --> 01:15:37.439
It may take a day
or two, but yeah.

01:15:37.463 --> 01:15:38.855
And what are we supposed to do?

01:15:38.879 --> 01:15:41.858
Just hole up here until then?

01:15:41.882 --> 01:15:43.953
Not here, but somewhere.
Somewhere nice.

01:15:44.954 --> 01:15:46.759
And then, we can leave for good.

01:15:46.783 --> 01:15:49.141
What did I get myself into?

01:15:49.165 --> 01:15:51.799
I am running away
with a classic freak

01:15:51.823 --> 01:15:53.825
that I have to teach
to become a man.

01:16:04.974 --> 01:16:06.562
I could really go
for a corn dog.

01:16:08.011 --> 01:16:09.495
And some vodka.

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:12.498
I think it will make
me feel better.

01:16:12.809 --> 01:16:13.914
Okay.

01:18:32.604 --> 01:18:33.639
Okay.

01:18:35.883 --> 01:18:36.883
Hubba hubba.

01:18:37.954 --> 01:18:39.059
Coyote Jim?

01:18:39.576 --> 01:18:40.612
Yeah.

01:18:42.752 --> 01:18:45.134
Uh, I'm Vincent. We
met a while back.

01:18:45.824 --> 01:18:46.929
I'm with Arthur.

01:18:47.757 --> 01:18:49.621
Oh, yeah. Arthur's brother.

01:18:49.966 --> 01:18:51.002
Yeah.

01:18:51.796 --> 01:18:54.464
Well, I have...

01:18:54.488 --> 01:18:56.248
We have come into some stuff

01:18:57.284 --> 01:18:58.734
that I think could interest you.

01:19:00.805 --> 01:19:03.507
A 1916 Mercury Head dime.

01:19:03.531 --> 01:19:05.889
Sucker's worth a pretty penny.

01:19:05.913 --> 01:19:09.099
We got a bunch of
these little guys,

01:19:09.123 --> 01:19:11.930
and after a while of
having them I thought,

01:19:11.954 --> 01:19:13.345
it's all kind of silly,

01:19:13.369 --> 01:19:15.071
you know, money you can't spend.

01:19:15.095 --> 01:19:18.132
So why not get rid of some of them
for some money you can spend?

01:19:25.484 --> 01:19:26.484
Five hundred.

01:19:28.142 --> 01:19:29.142
Five?

01:19:30.041 --> 01:19:31.456
Five hundred? That's it?

01:19:35.805 --> 01:19:37.818
I...

01:19:37.842 --> 01:19:40.165
I hope this is the same
deal you would give Arthur,

01:19:40.189 --> 01:19:43.192
because he'd want you to deal with
me as you would with him, you know.

01:19:44.193 --> 01:19:45.791
Can you...

01:19:45.815 --> 01:19:48.887
Can you do $700? These
things are pretty rare.

01:19:53.754 --> 01:19:55.525
What about this?

01:19:55.549 --> 01:19:56.757
This is pure gold. These...

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.116
Gotta be worth a few thousand?

01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:01.460
We can do something
with the gold.

01:20:02.383 --> 01:20:03.543
How soon can you let me know?

01:20:04.523 --> 01:20:06.146
Tomorrow, day after next.

01:20:10.529 --> 01:20:11.876
Okay, I'll do it.

01:20:13.981 --> 01:20:15.155
I'm trusting you here.

01:20:18.503 --> 01:20:19.825
I hate to say it, Coyote Jim,

01:20:19.849 --> 01:20:23.208
but I don't know if this
is the most fair deal,

01:20:23.232 --> 01:20:25.165
but I'm trusting you.

01:20:27.892 --> 01:20:31.861
I wouldn't mind if you kept
this meeting between us.

01:21:20.116 --> 01:21:21.946
Hey, I told you it'll
be a few days.

01:21:27.779 --> 01:21:29.239
Why you pull out a knife?

01:21:29.263 --> 01:21:30.758
Why do you have your
hand on your gun?

01:21:30.782 --> 01:21:32.967
- I see gold teeth.
- So?

01:21:32.991 --> 01:21:34.555
We got a murder
I'm investigating

01:21:34.579 --> 01:21:36.039
that's got gold
teeth all over it.

01:21:36.063 --> 01:21:38.076
- You a cop?
- Yeah.

01:21:39.515 --> 01:21:40.792
Hey, stay where you are.

01:21:42.173 --> 01:21:43.174
Stay where you are.

01:22:01.502 --> 01:22:02.502
Hubba hubba.

01:22:26.591 --> 01:22:29.511
You can wear these until you get a
chance to put on some of your own duds.

01:22:29.535 --> 01:22:30.605
Thanks.

01:22:37.538 --> 01:22:39.689
Did you find anything
else at the junkyard?

01:22:39.713 --> 01:22:41.873
I heard they found a bunch
of stuff they ain't sure of.

01:22:41.897 --> 01:22:44.521
We have Forensics coming
down from Council.

01:22:44.545 --> 01:22:47.869
Any word on Vincent Herring?

01:22:47.893 --> 01:22:49.413
Nothing yet. We'll
bring him in though.

01:22:58.559 --> 01:23:01.331
Chief Riley. What a surprise.

01:23:01.355 --> 01:23:04.255
Uh. I got some bad news I
got to deliver, and I...

01:23:05.325 --> 01:23:06.878
I thought it best
to do it in person.

01:23:08.017 --> 01:23:09.846
Three people were
shot up in Elkhorn.

01:23:10.675 --> 01:23:12.135
They died.

01:23:12.159 --> 01:23:14.517
We've had a state investigator

01:23:14.541 --> 01:23:16.381
poking around the wood
on the Mickey murder,

01:23:16.405 --> 01:23:19.039
went up there and got into
it with an Indian man

01:23:19.063 --> 01:23:20.943
and a couple of young
fellows that work for him.

01:23:22.204 --> 01:23:23.767
How can I help?

01:23:23.791 --> 01:23:26.173
The investigator followed
your brother there.

01:23:27.243 --> 01:23:28.762
My hands are kind of tied.

01:23:30.453 --> 01:23:31.730
We wanna bring him in formally.

01:23:33.284 --> 01:23:35.113
Anyway, I thought I'd let
you know personally.

01:23:36.770 --> 01:23:39.059
You know, I...

01:23:39.083 --> 01:23:42.407
I started doing this job when
I was no more than a teen.

01:23:42.431 --> 01:23:45.720
Didn't know much of the job
until I got on the job.

01:23:45.744 --> 01:23:49.196
People have different ideas
how to do it and such.

01:23:50.956 --> 01:23:52.924
As I got along, I realized that

01:23:54.443 --> 01:23:57.273
most of the job was
protecting what was around.

01:24:00.656 --> 01:24:02.451
I came up short this time up.

01:25:33.507 --> 01:25:35.751
I was hoping I'd get a
chance to catch you here.

01:25:45.243 --> 01:25:46.486
What are you doing here?

01:25:49.316 --> 01:25:51.698
I don't think I'll be able to
make it down here on Sunday.

01:25:57.359 --> 01:25:58.429
No, thanks.

01:26:00.707 --> 01:26:02.122
Yeah, I don't drink.

01:26:03.572 --> 01:26:04.952
I used to,

01:26:05.677 --> 01:26:06.885
but I don't anymore.

01:26:07.714 --> 01:26:09.129
Gave it up a long time ago.

01:26:12.201 --> 01:26:13.858
See, I was never any good at it.

01:26:15.260 --> 01:26:16.940
And I don't see the
point in doing anything

01:26:16.964 --> 01:26:19.771
that you're not good at, right?
So...

01:26:19.795 --> 01:26:23.039
Every once in a while,
I grab this bottle,

01:26:23.730 --> 01:26:25.328
set it right next to me,

01:26:25.352 --> 01:26:26.595
just to tempt myself,

01:26:27.975 --> 01:26:29.287
see how strong I am.

01:26:34.154 --> 01:26:36.087
Is everything okay
with your case?

01:26:40.954 --> 01:26:42.197
I'm getting close.

01:26:44.613 --> 01:26:46.546
Was there something I
could help you with?

01:26:50.066 --> 01:26:51.102
Run.

01:26:53.380 --> 01:26:54.554
Pardon me?

01:26:55.313 --> 01:26:56.313
Run.

01:26:57.971 --> 01:26:59.362
Flee.

01:26:59.386 --> 01:27:01.640
Make a move to get out of Dodge.

01:27:01.664 --> 01:27:03.010
Hell, I want you to.

01:27:05.496 --> 01:27:07.232
I knew you were involved

01:27:07.256 --> 01:27:08.716
in Lloyd Mickey's death.

01:27:08.740 --> 01:27:10.304
Your brother, too.

01:27:10.328 --> 01:27:13.307
I don't know how, and
I don't know when.

01:27:13.331 --> 01:27:17.611
But I do know it's about some
old coins and gold teeth.

01:27:18.785 --> 01:27:21.142
See, we got those right now.

01:27:21.166 --> 01:27:23.790
Down at the junkyard your
brother tried to sell a man.

01:27:25.101 --> 01:27:26.448
We're looking for him now.

01:27:27.759 --> 01:27:29.185
Put an APB out on him.

01:27:29.209 --> 01:27:30.807
We'll find him.

01:27:30.831 --> 01:27:32.764
It won't be before
long, but we will.

01:27:34.628 --> 01:27:36.019
But you...

01:27:37.700 --> 01:27:40.921
It'll be fun chasing you.

01:27:40.945 --> 01:27:43.465
See, I get the feeling that you're
the brains of this operation.

01:27:46.675 --> 01:27:48.987
I'm not sure what
you're talking about.

01:27:50.541 --> 01:27:51.818
But if we're done here...

01:27:52.888 --> 01:27:54.165
I'll see you soon.

01:28:09.905 --> 01:28:11.458
Ah, Vincent. Thank God.

01:28:13.495 --> 01:28:14.634
We got trouble.

01:28:21.399 --> 01:28:22.642
Connie?

01:28:23.367 --> 01:28:24.506
She's with me.

01:28:26.818 --> 01:28:28.520
That doesn't make any sense.

01:28:28.544 --> 01:28:29.925
We're going to Alaska.

01:28:31.167 --> 01:28:33.836
- Alaska?
- You heard me.

01:28:33.860 --> 01:28:35.940
I know things have been bad,
but we'll take a ride...

01:28:35.964 --> 01:28:38.104
No, we've talked about this,
and that's all it was.

01:28:39.106 --> 01:28:40.394
Talk.

01:28:40.418 --> 01:28:41.488
So we're leaving.

01:28:43.214 --> 01:28:44.284
Does she know?

01:28:45.112 --> 01:28:46.573
About you and me? About us?

01:28:46.597 --> 01:28:47.850
About who we are?

01:28:47.874 --> 01:28:49.852
Vincent told me everything,

01:28:49.876 --> 01:28:51.819
and it doesn't matter.

01:28:51.843 --> 01:28:53.362
I only care about who he is,

01:28:54.052 --> 01:28:55.191
not who he was.

01:28:57.193 --> 01:28:58.333
This is happening, Arthur.

01:28:59.437 --> 01:29:00.828
This is what it is.

01:29:00.852 --> 01:29:02.865
I want what's coming to me.

01:29:02.889 --> 01:29:04.418
- I want my share.
- What do you mean?

01:29:04.442 --> 01:29:06.109
The money, Arthur.

01:29:06.133 --> 01:29:08.042
The money from Lloyd's stash.

01:29:08.066 --> 01:29:10.769
You got your share.

01:29:10.793 --> 01:29:12.243
Well, that didn't work out.

01:29:13.106 --> 01:29:14.670
We need that money.

01:29:14.694 --> 01:29:16.672
I don't have it. I
gave most of it away.

01:29:17.973 --> 01:29:19.423
It's not here!

01:29:21.114 --> 01:29:23.403
Oh, God!

01:29:26.533 --> 01:29:27.603
I know you.

01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:31.411
You don't trust anyone.

01:29:31.435 --> 01:29:33.575
You got money buried
all over this town.

01:29:36.819 --> 01:29:37.958
Tell me where it is.

01:29:38.787 --> 01:29:39.971
What are you doing, Vincent?

01:29:39.995 --> 01:29:40.995
Tell him, Arthur!

01:29:42.756 --> 01:29:44.769
You're insane.

01:29:44.793 --> 01:29:47.140
I was insane believing
you all these years.

01:29:47.968 --> 01:29:49.176
Is this what you want?

01:29:49.832 --> 01:29:51.075
Oh!

01:29:51.627 --> 01:29:52.904
We're through.

01:29:54.458 --> 01:29:55.735
You can keep the businesses,

01:29:56.667 --> 01:29:57.978
the cars.

01:29:59.255 --> 01:30:00.602
I just want the money,

01:30:01.982 --> 01:30:03.156
so I can leave.

01:30:04.295 --> 01:30:05.676
Please, just let me leave.

01:30:07.574 --> 01:30:09.300
I buried it

01:30:10.025 --> 01:30:11.198
at the cemetery.

01:30:13.925 --> 01:30:14.961
Burns.

01:30:16.169 --> 01:30:17.412
Thomas.

01:30:18.620 --> 01:30:19.862
Burns.

01:30:22.209 --> 01:30:23.694
It's the gravestone.

01:30:29.872 --> 01:30:31.391
Come on, let's go, let's go.

01:30:40.538 --> 01:30:42.861
That name, "Burns,"
on the gravestone...

01:30:42.885 --> 01:30:44.024
What about it?

01:30:45.785 --> 01:30:47.372
Burns is my real last name.

01:30:50.652 --> 01:30:53.113
Arthur asked me to
take his last name

01:30:53.137 --> 01:30:55.874
when we first got here,
say we're brothers,

01:30:55.898 --> 01:30:57.728
you know, so people
wouldn't ask questions.

01:30:58.901 --> 01:31:00.144
Why would he bury...

01:31:01.732 --> 01:31:04.365
You know what? I
don't wanna know.

01:31:04.389 --> 01:31:06.989
I think that maybe the two of
you need to work things out,

01:31:07.013 --> 01:31:09.878
and I don't want to be part
of a fucked up relationship.

01:31:11.086 --> 01:31:12.339
I can't do it.

01:31:12.363 --> 01:31:13.502
No!

01:31:18.818 --> 01:31:19.991
I'm sorry.

01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:25.214
Look, we're doing this, okay?

01:31:25.238 --> 01:31:27.078
I'm gonna drop you
off at the motel

01:31:27.102 --> 01:31:28.804
while I get the money,

01:31:28.828 --> 01:31:30.070
and then we're out of here.

01:31:38.458 --> 01:31:39.459
Chief Riley?

01:32:26.575 --> 01:32:29.135
I have a feeling there's gonna be
a heck of a snow that's coming.

01:32:31.511 --> 01:32:35.929
Most of the time we're just worried
about a limb or a branch falling off.

01:32:38.138 --> 01:32:40.485
So I'm thinking all the
landscape's gonna turn.

01:32:43.523 --> 01:32:45.525
The changes been
happening around here,

01:32:47.734 --> 01:32:49.356
it's not passed me by.

01:32:50.910 --> 01:32:52.325
It already has.

01:32:55.875 --> 01:32:58.395
I suppose the worst thing to do
is try to keep up with something

01:32:58.419 --> 01:33:00.076
when you ain't got the
dog in you no more.

01:33:04.648 --> 01:33:06.028
My dog's gone to sleep.

01:33:17.315 --> 01:33:18.351
Arthur?

01:33:22.666 --> 01:33:23.667
Jesus!

01:33:24.978 --> 01:33:26.369
Are you all right?

01:33:26.393 --> 01:33:27.705
Did Vincent do this to you?

01:33:29.949 --> 01:33:31.157
Where's your brother?

01:33:35.506 --> 01:33:36.852
He's not my brother.

01:33:37.784 --> 01:33:39.199
Excuse me?

01:33:41.132 --> 01:33:42.617
He's not my brother.

01:33:46.690 --> 01:33:47.794
He's my...

01:33:51.211 --> 01:33:52.247
He's a con.

01:33:54.801 --> 01:33:56.251
I'm gonna go ring
him an ambulance.

01:33:58.874 --> 01:34:01.187
You hear that, Arthur? We got
an ambulance on the way.

01:34:03.983 --> 01:34:07.055
It all happened so fast.

01:34:09.022 --> 01:34:10.748
Orlando, they found Vincent.

01:34:15.270 --> 01:34:16.443
You hold on.

01:36:56.362 --> 01:36:57.857
Goddamn it!

01:36:57.881 --> 01:37:00.549
You motherfucking
son-of-a-bitch!

01:37:00.573 --> 01:37:02.965
God-fucking-damn it!

01:37:21.628 --> 01:37:22.940
Vincent, drop it.

01:37:26.357 --> 01:37:28.187
No! It's all over, Vincent.

01:37:31.224 --> 01:37:32.926
It's all over, Vincent.

01:37:32.950 --> 01:37:35.895
What's over? What's over?

01:37:35.919 --> 01:37:37.299
We talked to Arthur.

01:37:39.094 --> 01:37:42.108
I don't know what he told you,

01:37:42.132 --> 01:37:43.799
but this is all him.

01:37:43.823 --> 01:37:45.421
This is all him!

01:37:45.445 --> 01:37:47.044
It was Arthur's plan!

01:37:47.068 --> 01:37:48.207
It's all Arthur's plan!

01:37:50.071 --> 01:37:51.589
He's not doing so good, Vincent.

01:37:53.384 --> 01:37:54.914
What do you mean?

01:37:54.938 --> 01:37:57.123
We sent an ambulance
over for him, Vincent.

01:37:57.147 --> 01:37:59.953
Like he said, he's
not doing very good.

01:37:59.977 --> 01:38:02.911
We could take you to him, but I
need you to put your gun down.

01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:08.548
Vincent! Vincent! Vince...

01:38:08.572 --> 01:38:09.607
It's not worth it.

01:38:10.954 --> 01:38:12.921
There's only one place he's gonna go.
Come on.

01:38:24.174 --> 01:38:25.520
Arthur!

01:38:26.176 --> 01:38:27.522
Arthur!

01:38:28.419 --> 01:38:29.765
Arthur!

01:39:03.144 --> 01:39:04.524
Come on.

01:40:38.101 --> 01:40:39.447
Ain't this beautiful?

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:42.277
Your new hat is something.

01:40:43.451 --> 01:40:44.831
Looking sharp, shooter.

01:40:49.008 --> 01:40:51.090
You know, when I first
started coming out here,

01:40:51.114 --> 01:40:54.369
I was no bigger than a June bug.

01:40:54.393 --> 01:40:56.567
Since then, I've never been
able to get enough of it.

01:40:57.672 --> 01:40:59.225
I don't think I ever will.

01:41:02.849 --> 01:41:03.919
Orlando?

01:41:04.437 --> 01:41:05.611
Where you at?

01:41:07.854 --> 01:41:10.937
I'm sorry, Chief. I just keep
running through things in my head,

01:41:10.961 --> 01:41:12.521
just trying to make
sense of everything.

01:41:14.309 --> 01:41:15.931
See if everything can add up.

01:41:17.278 --> 01:41:20.395
We're in a boat, floating
in the middle of paradise,

01:41:20.419 --> 01:41:21.799
and you're still back there?

01:41:23.974 --> 01:41:25.079
Didn't I tell you?

01:41:26.459 --> 01:41:28.668
Those small towns have a
way of pulling folks in.

01:41:32.016 --> 01:41:33.811
The stories are mostly the same.

01:41:35.054 --> 01:41:37.367
People see money and
do crazy things.

01:41:39.023 --> 01:41:40.715
You add in the element of love,

01:41:42.061 --> 01:41:44.063
there ain't no good
gonna come from it.

01:41:45.547 --> 01:41:48.032
All you can do is
clench up and hold on.

01:41:49.689 --> 01:41:52.175
Reckon your asshole will
be eating your underwear.

01:41:53.176 --> 01:41:54.832
That's just part of the ride.

01:41:56.144 --> 01:41:59.192
Yeah, I suppose so,

01:41:59.216 --> 01:42:02.437
but I just keep thinking about
what Arthur Herring said.

01:42:02.461 --> 01:42:05.981
He said that some
secrets stay safe.

01:42:07.466 --> 01:42:08.826
I guess I have a
problem with that.

01:42:10.572 --> 01:42:12.988
Not much you can do about
it, one way or the other.

01:42:17.579 --> 01:42:19.799
I like fishing,

01:42:19.823 --> 01:42:21.583
'cause there ain't no
thinking involved.

01:42:23.206 --> 01:42:26.392
You stretch back and reel out.

01:42:26.416 --> 01:42:29.567
If they bite, they bite.
If they don't, they don't.

01:42:29.591 --> 01:42:30.991
There's nothing you
can do about it.

01:42:33.077 --> 01:42:34.872
As long as you've
got your line out,

01:42:36.357 --> 01:42:38.221
what will come will come.

01:42:41.741 --> 01:42:43.478
I'll tell you something, Chief.

01:42:43.502 --> 01:42:44.779
What's that?

01:42:46.781 --> 01:42:48.403
I've never been one for fishing.

01:42:49.305 --> 01:42:55.365
