WEBVTT

00:01.418 --> 00:05.172
It seems today
that all you see

00:05.255 --> 00:08.175
Is violence in movies
and sex on TV

00:08.258 --> 00:11.887
But where are those good
old-fashioned values

00:11.970 --> 00:14.973
On which we used to rely?

00:15.057 --> 00:18.310
Lucky there's a family guy

00:18.393 --> 00:21.522
Lucky there's a man who
positively can do

00:21.605 --> 00:23.023
All the things
that make us

00:23.106 --> 00:24.733
Laugh and cry

00:24.816 --> 00:29.696
He's...
a... fam... ily... guy!

00:38.247 --> 00:41.875
That's funny-- I don't remember
buying Stewie these toys.

00:44.169 --> 00:45.671
( gasps )

00:45.754 --> 00:48.757
My God, it all makes sense now.

00:48.841 --> 00:51.885
My baby is some kind
of diabolical genius

00:51.969 --> 00:53.846
bent on world domination!

00:56.348 --> 00:57.683
Bravo, Lois.

00:57.766 --> 01:00.602
The last horse finally
crosses the finish line.

01:00.686 --> 01:01.937
Stewie! All these months

01:02.020 --> 01:03.522
I should have been
paying attention

01:03.605 --> 01:05.023
to what you've been saying.

01:05.107 --> 01:06.358
You're an evil child.

01:06.441 --> 01:08.527
Why, why did I have
to go and smoke pot

01:08.610 --> 01:10.445
when I was pregnant with you?

01:10.529 --> 01:11.989
Cheer up, Mother--
you should be proud.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.282
You've given birth

01:13.365 --> 01:15.117
to the future emperor
of the world.

01:15.200 --> 01:18.120
Pity you won't be around
to enjoy it. Cheerio.

01:19.454 --> 01:21.290
( yelling )

01:21.373 --> 01:22.583
( gasps )
Lois... Lois...

01:22.666 --> 01:23.959
Hmm?
What's the matter?

01:24.042 --> 01:26.545
Oh, I just had
the strangest dream.

01:26.628 --> 01:29.381
Something about Stewie
and Cheerios...

01:29.464 --> 01:31.216
Uh... Huh, it's gone.

01:31.300 --> 01:32.676
Well, come on, get up.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.178
It's opening day
for the Sox.

01:34.261 --> 01:36.346
Hey, Chris, Meg,
we're going to Fenway!

01:36.430 --> 01:38.015
Peter, you can't
just pull the kids

01:38.098 --> 01:39.850
out of school for
a baseball game.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.560
Ah, there's nothing
these kids learn in school

01:41.643 --> 01:42.978
they can't learn on the street.

01:43.061 --> 01:45.355
It's 3:00. Where
the hell is Louie?

01:45.439 --> 01:46.607
Well, you tell me.

01:46.690 --> 01:47.983
Louie left his house at 2:15

01:48.066 --> 01:50.277
and has to travel
a distance of 6.2 miles

01:50.360 --> 01:52.029
at a rate
of five miles per hour.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.697
What time will Louie arrive?

01:53.780 --> 01:55.657
Depends if he stops
to see his ho.

01:55.741 --> 01:57.784
That's what we call
a "variable."

01:57.868 --> 01:59.494
Look what I made
for the game.

01:59.578 --> 02:01.288
What's that mean, anyway?

02:01.371 --> 02:04.416
"And the Lord said, 'Go Sox.'"

02:04.499 --> 02:06.418
Dad, don't you have
to work today?

02:06.502 --> 02:09.379
Heh-heh. It's nothing
a little phone call can't take care of.

02:11.215 --> 02:12.424
Hello?

02:12.508 --> 02:14.343
Mr. Weed, I can't
come to work today.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.178
I was in a terrible
plane crash.

02:16.261 --> 02:17.846
My entire family
was killed

02:17.930 --> 02:19.389
and I am a vegetable.

02:19.473 --> 02:20.849
I'll see you tomorrow.

02:20.933 --> 02:22.267
Eh? Eh?

02:22.351 --> 02:23.519
Oh, please, Peter

02:23.602 --> 02:25.604
your excuses are lamer
than FDR's legs.

02:25.687 --> 02:26.813
( gasping )

02:26.897 --> 02:28.148
Too soon?

02:31.109 --> 02:32.486
( crowd cheering )

02:32.569 --> 02:34.112
Here it comes, Jeremy.

02:34.196 --> 02:36.365
I got it! I got it!

02:36.448 --> 02:38.450
Yes! Yeah! Whoo!

02:38.534 --> 02:40.869
All right!
I'm the man! Yeah!

02:40.953 --> 02:42.663
Hold on to this, Stewie.

02:42.746 --> 02:44.081
It'll be a souvenir

02:44.164 --> 02:46.416
of your first major league game
with your dad.

02:46.500 --> 02:49.127
My God, I...
I shall cherish this forever.

02:49.211 --> 02:52.005
I say, Opie, I'll trade you this
baseball for your souvenir bat.

02:52.089 --> 02:53.465
Sure.

02:53.549 --> 02:55.175
Aah!
What did you learn?

02:55.259 --> 02:57.845
This is great. We haven't done
anything together like this

02:57.928 --> 02:59.221
since we saw Mike Tyson
get beat.

02:59.304 --> 03:00.514
All right, Mike

03:00.597 --> 03:02.224
the word again is...

03:02.307 --> 03:03.600
"onomatopoeia."

03:03.684 --> 03:05.894
Uh... "C."

03:05.978 --> 03:07.271
I'm sorry, that's incorrect.

03:07.396 --> 03:08.856
Oh, dang.

03:08.939 --> 03:12.484
I'm so glad you talked us all
into playing hooky.

03:12.568 --> 03:14.194
Me, too. Hey,
maybe we can get on TV

03:14.278 --> 03:16.697
if we take our shirts off
and run onto the field.

03:16.780 --> 03:18.740
Peter, I'm not
taking my shirt off.

03:18.824 --> 03:20.659
-There-- now they're old news.
-Peter!

03:20.742 --> 03:21.827
Go Sox!

03:21.910 --> 03:22.911
Go... Aah!

03:22.995 --> 03:25.998
( yelling and grunting )

03:26.081 --> 03:27.916
Ow!

03:28.000 --> 03:29.459
Hmm.

03:34.548 --> 03:35.549
Peter?
( gasps )

03:35.632 --> 03:38.010
Oh, uh...,
hi, Mr. Weed.

03:38.093 --> 03:40.762
Well, it seems you have made
a full recovery.

03:40.846 --> 03:42.139
Oh. Yeah, yeah.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.224
Uh, that plane crash
I told you about?

03:44.308 --> 03:45.601
It turned out to be gas.

03:45.684 --> 03:47.144
Aha! Liar!

03:47.227 --> 03:49.479
Tomorrow, my office, 9:30.

03:49.563 --> 03:52.357
I'm tired of Mr. Weed
treating me like a common doormat.

03:52.441 --> 03:55.194
I-I want him to treat me
like one of those deluxe ones

03:55.277 --> 03:57.154
from Pottery Barn,
with the fancy straw.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.947
Mm, I don't care
for Pottery Barn.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.949
Peter, if you want
Mr. Weed to respect you

04:01.033 --> 04:02.409
you're going to
have to earn it.

04:02.492 --> 04:05.120
Hmm. Earn it.

04:05.204 --> 04:06.788
( slurping )

04:08.999 --> 04:11.460
( sobbing ):
Why have you forsaken me?

04:11.543 --> 04:13.212
Uh, M-M-Mr. Weed?

04:13.295 --> 04:15.506
Um, I heard you ran
into my identical twin brother

04:15.589 --> 04:16.924
at the ball game yesterday.

04:17.007 --> 04:18.258
And if you don't buy that

04:18.342 --> 04:20.302
I'm sorry I was
at the ball game yesterday.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.971
Peter, I just received
terrible news--

04:23.055 --> 04:26.225
this company has been taken over
by a conglomerate.

04:26.308 --> 04:28.560
After 23 years
of faithful service

04:28.644 --> 04:30.020
I've been terminated!

04:30.103 --> 04:32.814
Wow, the business world
sure is funny.

04:32.898 --> 04:34.566
Hey, Dilbert,
what do you call it

04:34.650 --> 04:36.193
when a guy in
middle management

04:36.276 --> 04:38.278
moves all the way
to upper management?

04:38.362 --> 04:40.113
I don't know.
What do you call it?

04:40.197 --> 04:41.448
A promotion.

04:41.532 --> 04:43.242
Oh, thanks.

04:43.325 --> 04:45.244
Here's a memo.

04:49.873 --> 04:51.708
Well, sometimes
the business world's funny.

04:56.171 --> 04:59.091
And so, on behalf of
the El Dorado Cigarette Company

04:59.174 --> 05:01.802
I'd like to welcome you
to our family.

05:01.885 --> 05:05.013
I think you'll be very happy
with the changes we've made.

05:06.557 --> 05:07.766
Ah, this is sweet!

05:07.850 --> 05:09.393
Hey, why are you
putting a window

05:09.476 --> 05:10.853
in the middle of the factory?

05:10.936 --> 05:13.313
So Aunt Bee has a place
to let her pies cool.

05:13.397 --> 05:15.274
Hello, boys.
Today's pie is cherry.

05:15.357 --> 05:17.526
It'll be ready just
in time for lunch.

05:17.609 --> 05:19.862
Wow, these guys sure know
how to run a company.

05:21.405 --> 05:23.824
Look how happy
those morons are.

05:23.907 --> 05:26.451
They'll never realize
we're using those toys

05:26.535 --> 05:29.538
to get children addicted
to our company's cigarettes.

05:29.621 --> 05:31.415
( fiendish laughter )

05:31.498 --> 05:32.499
( thunderclap )

05:32.583 --> 05:34.126
( whistles )

05:34.209 --> 05:36.211
Good boy, Connor.

05:36.295 --> 05:37.379
Pull.

05:37.462 --> 05:38.589
( dog yelps )

05:38.672 --> 05:41.842
( all laughing )

05:47.222 --> 05:48.432
Can't we eat?

05:48.515 --> 05:51.852
I'm so hungry,
I could ride a horse.

05:51.935 --> 05:53.645
I don't get it.

05:53.729 --> 05:56.106
Well, I could ride it
to the store, I guess.

05:56.190 --> 05:58.817
I told you, we're not starting
without your father.

05:58.901 --> 06:00.569
Dinner just isn't dinner
without him.

06:00.652 --> 06:03.405
Ooh, well, perhaps I could help
simulate the experience.

06:03.488 --> 06:04.823
Num, num, num, num, num!

06:04.907 --> 06:06.533
( excited noises )

06:06.617 --> 06:08.493
( raspberries )

06:08.577 --> 06:09.828
Peter:
Hey, family

06:09.912 --> 06:11.788
anyone in the mood
for lobster...

06:11.872 --> 06:14.124
Aah! Aah! Ow! Oh, God!
One of them has my pupil!

06:14.208 --> 06:17.169
Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!
Oh, God! Aah! Aah!

06:17.252 --> 06:19.046
Ah.

06:19.129 --> 06:21.423
Peter, how the hell can you
afford lobster on your salary?

06:21.507 --> 06:24.009
I got a raise.
What?!

06:24.092 --> 06:26.094
Yeah. The new owners
gave everyone raises.

06:26.178 --> 06:28.055
Even Kenneth,
the bad-ass mail clerk

06:28.138 --> 06:29.556
with the heart of gold.

06:29.640 --> 06:32.059
Hi, Kenneth. Hey,
did I get any mail?

06:32.142 --> 06:34.228
No, and if you come any closer,
I'll slice you!

06:34.311 --> 06:35.562
Okay, okay.

06:35.646 --> 06:36.813
Man, what a bad-ass.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.565
Yeah? Well,
that "bad-ass"

06:38.649 --> 06:40.734
just gave half his
paycheck to orphans--

06:40.817 --> 06:42.361
orphans with diseases.

06:48.033 --> 06:49.910
And check out
the new toys we're making.

06:49.993 --> 06:52.120
"Baby Smokes-A-Lot"?

06:53.413 --> 06:54.581
( doll giggles )

06:54.665 --> 06:56.208
Tastes like happy!

06:56.291 --> 06:58.460
Cool! That's imitatable.

06:58.544 --> 06:59.628
What the hell...?

06:59.711 --> 07:01.588
"El Dorado Cigarettes"?

07:01.672 --> 07:02.673
They bought your company?

07:02.756 --> 07:03.966
Oh, my God!

07:04.049 --> 07:05.467
They're trying
to corrupt our children.

07:05.551 --> 07:07.302
What do you expect?

07:07.386 --> 07:09.388
Those bastards turned
a whole generation of Americans

07:09.471 --> 07:11.431
into smokers with their
damn subliminal advertising.

07:11.515 --> 07:13.058
Timmy, where's Lassie?

07:13.141 --> 07:15.143
She's out in the orchard, Ma.

07:15.227 --> 07:17.479
Peaches are coming in
mighty early this year.

07:17.563 --> 07:18.689
Smoke.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.023
You know what
they say, Timmy--

07:20.107 --> 07:22.025
"Early peaches;
long summer."

07:22.109 --> 07:23.110
Smoke.

07:23.193 --> 07:24.319
( barks )

07:24.403 --> 07:25.946
What's that, Lassie?

07:26.029 --> 07:27.322
Are you smoking yet?

07:27.406 --> 07:28.740
Peter, if kids
see this doll

07:28.866 --> 07:30.534
they're going to think
smoking's okay.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.536
You have to talk
to these new bosses of yours

07:32.619 --> 07:33.954
first thing in
the morning.

07:34.037 --> 07:35.497
Don't you worry, Lois.

07:35.581 --> 07:37.749
I'll set them straight,
just like I did with Chris.

07:37.833 --> 07:39.459
Dad

07:39.543 --> 07:41.086
what's the blowhole for?

07:41.170 --> 07:43.088
I'll tell you what
it's not for, son

07:43.172 --> 07:45.215
and when I do,
you'll understand

07:45.299 --> 07:47.509
why I can never go
back to Sea World.

07:49.595 --> 07:52.431
Gentlemen, we need to talk.

07:52.514 --> 07:54.600
My wife says you're trying
to get kids to smoke.

07:54.683 --> 07:55.893
That's just not true.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.394
Well, what about this toy?

07:57.477 --> 07:59.396
Peter, it's just a doll
with a cigarette.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.148
I mean, Barbie has a dream car

08:01.231 --> 08:03.525
but you don't see every
eight-year-old kid driving.

08:03.609 --> 08:04.610
They're just fun toys.

08:04.693 --> 08:05.986
Smoke.

08:06.069 --> 08:07.446
Not now, Jerry.

08:07.529 --> 08:09.656
Trust me, Peter--
the last thing we want

08:09.740 --> 08:11.366
is to get kids
to start smoking.

08:11.450 --> 08:14.119
Well, then-then what
about that graph on the wall that says

08:14.203 --> 08:15.537
"The first thing we want

08:15.621 --> 08:17.331
is to get kids
to start smoking"?

08:17.414 --> 08:20.125
That? Oh, that's just something
my son made me in art class.

08:20.209 --> 08:22.836
Huh. Well, wh-what about
that poster that says

08:22.920 --> 08:24.838
"The graph was not made
in art class.

08:24.922 --> 08:27.049
We really do want kids
to start smoking"?

08:27.132 --> 08:28.842
Look, we're a caring company.

08:28.926 --> 08:31.887
I mean, uh, would you really be
the president of a company

08:31.970 --> 08:33.805
that didn't care about kids?

08:33.889 --> 08:35.891
No, but I'm not
the president.

08:35.974 --> 08:39.061
Yes, you are...
if you want to be.

08:39.144 --> 08:40.354
All:
Ah...

08:40.437 --> 08:43.815
Oh, wow! Imagine me, president!

08:50.906 --> 08:52.157
I'll do it!

08:52.241 --> 08:55.452
( Peter humming
"Hail to the Chief" )

08:55.536 --> 08:57.037
So, how did it go?

08:57.120 --> 08:58.330
I-I'm not finished yet.

08:58.413 --> 08:59.414
( resumes humming )

09:02.543 --> 09:05.337
Aren't you going to ask me
how it went?

09:05.420 --> 09:07.714
Yes! Did you talk
to the company executives?

09:07.798 --> 09:10.050
( resumes humming )
Peter, answer me!

09:10.133 --> 09:12.135
Yeah, I did,
and they made me president.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.262
Of the whole company?

09:13.345 --> 09:14.888
All right, Dad!

09:14.972 --> 09:17.182
You should have seen
the way they were treating me.

09:17.266 --> 09:18.892
I've never gotten
that kind of respect before.

09:18.976 --> 09:20.894
Great workout, Bobby.

09:20.978 --> 09:23.021
Up yours, sack breath!

09:23.105 --> 09:25.023
That's Mr. Griffin.

09:25.107 --> 09:27.442
But, Peter, why would they
make you president?

09:27.526 --> 09:30.028
Well, maybe it's because
I can recite all 50 states

09:30.112 --> 09:31.530
in a quarter of a second.

09:31.613 --> 09:32.739
( yelps )

09:32.823 --> 09:35.033
Peter, that was just
a loud yelping noise.

09:35.117 --> 09:36.827
Geez, Lois, I thought
you'd be proud of me.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.287
After all these years

09:38.370 --> 09:40.205
the company finally thinks
I'm worth something.

09:40.289 --> 09:42.791
Just wait till you see all
the perks we're going to get.

09:46.420 --> 09:48.255
Um... hi.
Can I help you?

09:48.338 --> 09:51.091
Yeah. Some company hired me
to stand next to you all day

09:51.175 --> 09:52.843
so you'd look better
by comparison.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.678
That's ridiculous!
I don't need...

09:54.761 --> 09:56.013
Hey, Meg, did you
get less ugly?

09:56.096 --> 09:57.139
Yeah!

09:58.849 --> 10:00.809
Surprise!

10:00.893 --> 10:02.519
Uh, everything
looks the same.

10:02.603 --> 10:03.896
Oh, it looks the same

10:03.979 --> 10:05.856
but actually,
El Dorado Cigarettes

10:05.939 --> 10:07.983
has coated the entire
inside of the house

10:08.066 --> 10:10.319
with a microfilm of Teflon
so it's easy to clean.

10:10.402 --> 10:11.570
Oh.

10:13.155 --> 10:15.449
Heh. Maybe I shouldn't have
had them do the floors.

10:15.532 --> 10:17.159
I'm "Nudes on Ice!

10:18.493 --> 10:20.162
Ah, this is so exciting.

10:20.245 --> 10:22.664
Your father's first day
as president.

10:22.748 --> 10:24.625
Good morning, first family.

10:26.043 --> 10:27.878
Ooh, Lois,
what's in this coffee?

10:27.961 --> 10:29.713
Isn't it wonderful?

10:29.796 --> 10:32.799
The company sent Martha Stewart
to help me with the housework.

10:32.883 --> 10:35.511
I take back all the bad
things I said about them.

10:35.594 --> 10:37.471
The coffee is
delicious, Martha.

10:37.554 --> 10:39.681
A little chicory
perks up the taste

10:39.765 --> 10:41.183
of roasted coffee beans.

10:41.266 --> 10:42.643
It's a good thing.

10:42.726 --> 10:44.853
Well, I think
it's a crappy thing.

10:44.937 --> 10:47.481
In fact, this is
my last cigarette ever.

10:48.941 --> 10:50.359
You make me sick

10:50.442 --> 10:53.445
letting yourselves be bought off
with a few lousy perks.

10:53.529 --> 10:56.031
Ooh, I beg to differ.

10:58.408 --> 11:00.744
Oh, you don't need to
park here, Mr. Griffin.

11:00.827 --> 11:03.664
You have an executive
parking space now.

11:03.747 --> 11:06.124
Well, that looks exactly
like my old space.

11:06.208 --> 11:09.002
Yeah, but this one comes
with your own company suck-up.

11:09.086 --> 11:11.171
Morning, Mr. Griffin.
Nice day.

11:11.255 --> 11:13.298
Eh, it's a little cloudy.
It's absolutely cloudy--

11:13.382 --> 11:15.050
one of the worst days
I've seen in years.

11:15.133 --> 11:16.677
So, good news
about the Yankees.

11:16.760 --> 11:19.096
-I hate the Yankees. Pack of cheaters,
-that's what they are.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.681
I love your tie.
I hate this tie.

11:20.764 --> 11:22.850
It's awful, it's gaudy--
it's got to go.

11:22.933 --> 11:25.435
And I hate myself.
I hate you, too.

11:25.519 --> 11:27.521
You make me sick,
you fat sack of crap.

11:27.604 --> 11:29.731
But I'm the president.
The best there is.

11:29.815 --> 11:31.191
But you just said
you hated me.

11:31.275 --> 11:33.861
But... not you
the... president..

11:33.944 --> 11:36.363
the you who said
you hated... you..

11:36.446 --> 11:37.698
you who love... hate..

11:37.781 --> 11:40.075
Yankees... clouds...

11:40.158 --> 11:42.995
I'll have that fixed
for you tomorrow, sir.

11:44.329 --> 11:45.581
Here's your new digs.

11:45.664 --> 11:47.583
Now get to work, sport.

11:47.666 --> 11:49.251
We're counting on you.

11:52.296 --> 11:54.089
Wow, my own office.

11:54.173 --> 11:57.551
Well, I guess
I'd better get busy.

12:01.597 --> 12:03.891
( pencil sharpener whirring )

12:07.436 --> 12:09.605
( sighs )

12:11.607 --> 12:13.609
Ow!

12:18.113 --> 12:20.699
( zipper zipping )

12:20.782 --> 12:22.618
( pencil sharpener whirring )

12:22.701 --> 12:24.703
( screaming )

12:26.079 --> 12:28.290
Gentlemen, we have a problem.

12:28.373 --> 12:30.417
There's an anti-smoking
bill before Congress

12:30.501 --> 12:32.169
that could put us
out of business.

12:32.252 --> 12:35.756
Yes, apparently causing cancer
is this year's "hot button."

12:35.839 --> 12:37.925
I don't understand it.
We've tried everything

12:38.008 --> 12:39.968
to get through
to these politicians.

12:40.052 --> 12:42.429
Harvard lawyers, lobbyists,
wisecracking leprechauns.

12:42.513 --> 12:44.389
Excuse me, do you
have a dollar?

12:44.473 --> 12:45.724
I'm a little short.

12:45.807 --> 12:47.309
( chuckling )

12:47.392 --> 12:48.644
Maybe that's the problem.

12:48.727 --> 12:50.187
They're all idiots
in Washington.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.563
Instead of a smart guy

12:51.647 --> 12:53.440
we should send a moron
they can relate to.

12:53.524 --> 12:54.691
( all agreeing )

12:54.775 --> 12:56.193
But where are we going
to find someone

12:56.276 --> 12:57.861
within the company
who's that stupid?

12:57.945 --> 13:00.364
Yeah, and not just stupid--
fat, too.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.532
( all agreeing )

13:01.615 --> 13:02.866
Hey, wait a second.

13:02.950 --> 13:05.702
Didn't we just make
a fat, stupid guy president?

13:05.786 --> 13:07.079
You bet we did.

13:07.162 --> 13:09.998
Gentlemen, our new
tobacco lobbyist is...

13:10.082 --> 13:11.583
that guy.

13:11.667 --> 13:13.877
( up-tempo musical intro)

13:13.961 --> 13:19.424
Diamonds, daisies,
snowflakes, that guy

13:19.508 --> 13:25.430
Chestnuts, rainbows,
springtime is that guy

13:25.514 --> 13:29.268
He's tinsel on a tree

13:29.351 --> 13:33.856
He's everything
that every guy should be

13:33.939 --> 13:39.987
Sable, popcorn,
white wine, that guy

13:40.070 --> 13:46.410
Gingham, bluebirds, Broadway
is that guy

13:46.493 --> 13:49.830
He's mine alone,
but luckily for you

13:49.913 --> 13:53.417
If you find a guy to love

13:53.500 --> 13:55.961
Only one guy to love

13:56.044 --> 14:00.716
Then he'll be that guy, too

14:00.799 --> 14:02.968
That guy!

14:05.012 --> 14:06.972
So, uh, what's this
big assignment

14:07.055 --> 14:09.558
you got for me,
Chairman of The Broad?

14:09.641 --> 14:11.018
( chuckles )

14:11.101 --> 14:12.102
"Chairman of The Broad."

14:12.186 --> 14:13.562
When did you become
such a stitch?

14:13.645 --> 14:14.646
Don't you remember?

14:14.730 --> 14:15.898
You gave me writers.

14:15.981 --> 14:18.567
"Sir, I don't want
to say you're rich

14:18.650 --> 14:20.652
"but when you walk
into a bank

14:20.736 --> 14:22.571
all the tellers
go, 'whoopee.'"

14:22.654 --> 14:24.156
That wasn't funny.

14:24.239 --> 14:26.825
I thought you guys
said you were Jewish.

14:26.909 --> 14:28.452
Well, he's only
half Jewish.

14:28.535 --> 14:29.745
You're fired.

14:29.828 --> 14:31.205
Here's the thing,
Griffin.

14:31.288 --> 14:32.706
Some troublemakers
in Congress

14:32.789 --> 14:34.249
are trying
to shut us down.

14:34.333 --> 14:36.251
We need someone
important like you

14:36.335 --> 14:38.754
to go down to Washington
and help those bastards see

14:38.837 --> 14:40.506
what kind
of fun-loving people

14:40.589 --> 14:42.591
the tobacco industry's
really made of.

14:42.674 --> 14:44.676
Washington? Ah, sweet.

14:44.760 --> 14:46.720
I'm your man, but
I got to warn you--

14:46.803 --> 14:47.971
I've made some
enemies on the Hill.

14:49.806 --> 14:53.852
And that's when Clarence Thomas
forced me into his chambers

14:53.936 --> 14:56.146
and showed me lewd pictures.

14:56.230 --> 14:58.273
Mr. Griffin, we have
indisputable evidence

14:58.357 --> 15:00.526
that not only have you never
been in the same room

15:00.609 --> 15:01.902
as Clarence Thomas

15:01.985 --> 15:03.445
you've never been in
the same state.

15:03.529 --> 15:04.530
How do you respond to that?

15:06.323 --> 15:08.367
Bababooey, bababooey,
Howard Stern's penis.

15:08.450 --> 15:09.910
Bababooey, bababooey,
bababooey.

15:12.329 --> 15:14.164
How long is Dad
going to be in Washington?

15:14.248 --> 15:15.457
As long as it takes.

15:15.541 --> 15:17.251
He's a very important man now.

15:17.334 --> 15:20.462
You know, he's the spokesman
for his entire industry.

15:31.557 --> 15:34.101
Thank you, Martha.

15:34.184 --> 15:36.061
Brian, could you pass
me the TV Guide?

15:36.144 --> 15:37.145
Piss off.

15:37.229 --> 15:38.230
What?!

15:38.313 --> 15:39.314
I'm... I'm sorry.

15:39.398 --> 15:40.691
It just... it feels like
forever

15:40.774 --> 15:41.900
since I've had a smoke.

15:41.984 --> 15:42.985
I'm just a bit testy.

15:43.068 --> 15:44.152
Stop staring at my tail!

15:46.280 --> 15:47.322
Hello, Mr. Harrison?

15:47.406 --> 15:48.740
Yeah, I see those
government guys

15:48.824 --> 15:50.075
you were telling me about.

15:50.158 --> 15:51.410
I'll show them a good time

15:51.493 --> 15:53.078
and get them to come around
to our side.

15:54.705 --> 15:56.373
Excuse me.

15:56.456 --> 15:57.541
Al Gore? George W. Bush?

15:57.624 --> 15:59.543
-Yes.
-Yes.

15:59.626 --> 16:00.794
Great.

16:00.878 --> 16:02.171
And what's your friend's name?

16:02.296 --> 16:03.338
Dick Armey.

16:03.422 --> 16:05.924
( laughing )

16:10.554 --> 16:13.432
Oh, gosh. No, seriously,
what's his name?

16:13.515 --> 16:14.766
Dick Armey.

16:14.850 --> 16:17.186
( laughing )

16:22.733 --> 16:26.445
Oh, I just got it.

16:26.528 --> 16:30.657
Hey, Armey, hey, what's
your wife's name--

16:30.741 --> 16:32.618
Vagina Coast Guard?

16:32.701 --> 16:34.077
Oh, no, I'm kidding you guys.

16:34.161 --> 16:35.662
Get in the car.
We're going to a skin bar.

16:35.746 --> 16:36.830
( all agreeing )

16:36.914 --> 16:39.082
That sounds good.

16:41.418 --> 16:42.753
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

16:42.836 --> 16:44.004
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

16:44.087 --> 16:45.506
I don't know
what happened.

16:45.589 --> 16:46.632
It's okay.

16:46.715 --> 16:47.841
It's okay, Senator.

16:47.925 --> 16:49.885
This girl didn't
have a family.

16:49.968 --> 16:51.720
It'll be like
she never existed.

16:51.803 --> 16:53.180
Now grab ahold
of yourself.

16:53.263 --> 16:55.933
All right, now listen--
you may have killed her

16:56.016 --> 16:58.519
when you shoved all
those dollar bills down her throat.

16:58.602 --> 16:59.686
You may have
killed her

16:59.770 --> 17:01.230
when you hit her
with the stool--

17:01.313 --> 17:02.940
I don't know,
I'm not a doctor--

17:03.023 --> 17:05.567
but I'll tell you what
didn't kill her--

17:05.651 --> 17:06.818
smoking.

17:06.902 --> 17:08.070
You have our
support, Griffin.

17:10.531 --> 17:13.575
Look, kids, here's your father
in People Magazine

17:13.659 --> 17:14.701
with Jim Carrey.

17:14.785 --> 17:17.371
And they're both... smokin'.

17:17.454 --> 17:19.331
I loved that in Mask.

17:19.414 --> 17:20.958
Smokin'.

17:21.834 --> 17:24.169
Smokin'.

17:24.253 --> 17:25.420
Smokin'...

17:25.504 --> 17:27.548
Damn it! Do I have
to listen to this drivel

17:27.631 --> 17:28.882
24 hours a day?!

17:28.966 --> 17:30.551
But, hey, I guess
anything's better

17:30.634 --> 17:32.177
than looking
at your smelly face.

17:32.261 --> 17:33.470
Mom!

17:33.554 --> 17:34.972
Now, honey, your face
smells fine.

17:35.055 --> 17:36.348
You know he doesn't
mean it.

17:36.431 --> 17:37.850
It's just the lack
of nicotine.

17:37.933 --> 17:39.643
Hey, Mom, the school
janitor said

17:39.726 --> 17:41.520
that Dad's working
for the bad guys

17:41.603 --> 17:44.064
and he said it through
a hole in his throat.

17:44.147 --> 17:45.732
Well, that doesn't
make him right.

17:45.816 --> 17:47.526
If I had a hole
in my throat

17:47.609 --> 17:48.902
I'd put pennies in it.

17:48.986 --> 17:50.821
Listen, you father's
doing great work

17:50.904 --> 17:52.656
and life's
never been better.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.074
Yes, I too applaud the oaf

17:54.157 --> 17:56.159
for finally showing
some initiative.

17:56.243 --> 17:57.953
God knows it was years overdue.

17:59.580 --> 18:00.581
( gasps )

18:00.664 --> 18:02.040
Oh, you know who I saw

18:02.124 --> 18:03.375
at the market today?

18:03.458 --> 18:04.710
Patty Croft.

18:04.793 --> 18:07.796
Oh, and she has gotten fat.

18:07.880 --> 18:09.882
Oh, my god! Stewie, no!

18:09.965 --> 18:11.967
Oh, God,
what have I done?

18:12.050 --> 18:15.470
I knew smoking was bad,
but I still sold my soul

18:15.554 --> 18:18.056
and for what?
Martha Stewart?

18:18.140 --> 18:20.267
Come on, kids,
we got to put a stop to this.

18:20.350 --> 18:21.977
Now!

18:23.187 --> 18:24.188
( sighs )

18:24.271 --> 18:25.522
Finally.

18:25.606 --> 18:27.566
( breaking wind )

18:27.649 --> 18:29.067
Ah.

18:30.819 --> 18:32.946
They call me Bill

18:33.030 --> 18:35.157
Yes, they call me Bill

18:35.240 --> 18:37.910
And I'm standing here
on Capitol...

18:37.993 --> 18:39.036
( screams )

18:43.332 --> 18:46.251
Bob Dole's a friend
of the tobacco industry.

18:46.335 --> 18:48.337
Bob Dole likes your style.

18:48.420 --> 18:51.006
Bob Dole, Bob Dole...

18:51.089 --> 18:55.552
Bob Dole, Bob Dole,
Bob Dole, Bob Dole...

18:55.636 --> 18:58.597
Bob Dole... Bob Dole...

18:58.680 --> 19:00.182
Lois:
There you are.

19:00.265 --> 19:01.975
Peter, I caught
Stewie smoking.

19:02.059 --> 19:03.644
That cigarette company
is evil.

19:03.727 --> 19:05.521
We can't be a part
of this anymore.

19:05.604 --> 19:07.648
Lois, this is
the best job I ever had.

19:07.731 --> 19:09.233
Hey, since I
became president

19:09.316 --> 19:11.610
profits have been higher
than Alyssa Milano.

19:11.693 --> 19:13.445
( laughing )

19:13.529 --> 19:15.030
What kind of cheap shot?!

19:15.113 --> 19:16.198
Joel!

19:16.281 --> 19:18.075
I'm suing, I'm suing.
I'm on it.

19:18.158 --> 19:19.785
Mr. Griffin, time
for your speech.

19:19.868 --> 19:21.411
But Peter, what about
your son?

19:21.495 --> 19:22.704
So Stewie
had a puff.

19:22.788 --> 19:24.873
He's old enough to make
his own decisions.

19:24.957 --> 19:26.583
For God's sakes,
Lois, he's one.

19:26.667 --> 19:27.918
Cut the umbilical cord.

19:28.001 --> 19:30.087
( applause )

19:30.170 --> 19:32.256
Ladies and gentlemen
of Congress--

19:32.339 --> 19:34.883
I am here today to talk
to you about smoking.

19:34.967 --> 19:37.678
Oh, please, Peter,
do the right thing.

19:37.761 --> 19:41.181
I know a lot of you are
already on my side.

19:41.265 --> 19:42.891
And for you naysayers

19:42.975 --> 19:45.477
I have two strong words
for you--

19:45.561 --> 19:47.729
Come on.

19:47.813 --> 19:49.314
Come on!

19:49.398 --> 19:51.149
Okay.

19:51.233 --> 19:52.276
Oh, okay.

19:52.359 --> 19:53.694
Sure.

19:53.777 --> 19:55.112
Thank you, ladies and...

19:55.195 --> 19:56.196
( coughing )

19:56.280 --> 19:59.658
And... and...

19:59.741 --> 20:02.452
( coughing )

20:02.536 --> 20:03.912
Baby needs to suck ash.

20:03.996 --> 20:05.539
Baby needs
to suck ash.

20:05.622 --> 20:06.832
Not ass, you pervert.

20:06.915 --> 20:08.500
Save it for
the interns.

20:08.584 --> 20:09.710
Is that a baby?

20:09.793 --> 20:10.836
( coughing )

20:10.919 --> 20:13.130
Oh, my God, that's Stewie!

20:13.213 --> 20:14.548
Lois was right.

20:14.631 --> 20:16.300
Children under four
shouldn't smoke.

20:16.383 --> 20:18.385
Look, I don't care about
this stupid job anymore.

20:18.510 --> 20:19.553
Cigarettes are bad.

20:19.636 --> 20:21.096
Mr. Griffin is right.

20:21.180 --> 20:23.056
Smoking is a horrible vice.

20:23.140 --> 20:26.059
It shortens life expectancy
and pollutes our air

20:26.143 --> 20:28.937
and according to recent polls,
air is good.

20:29.021 --> 20:30.939
Cigarettes killed my father...

20:31.023 --> 20:32.441
and raped my mother.

20:32.524 --> 20:34.860
Gentlemen, I propose
we send a message

20:34.943 --> 20:36.737
to tobacco companies everywhere

20:36.820 --> 20:39.114
by fining the El Dorado
Cigarette Company

20:39.198 --> 20:40.824
infinity billion dollars.

20:40.908 --> 20:42.284
That's the spirit, Frank.

20:42.367 --> 20:45.412
But I think a real number
might be more effective.

20:45.495 --> 20:48.248
All in favor of fining
this evil tobacco giant

20:48.332 --> 20:49.416
$100 million, say aye.

20:49.499 --> 20:50.876
All:
Aye.

20:50.959 --> 20:52.085
But that will
bankrupt us.

20:52.169 --> 20:54.087
Oh, you mean the way

20:54.171 --> 20:57.132
you've morally
bankrupted America?

20:57.216 --> 20:58.217
( laughing )

20:58.300 --> 20:59.760
Thanks for that
zinger, boys.

20:59.843 --> 21:01.637
Now give me
a snappy line to go out on.

21:01.720 --> 21:03.096
Actually, our lunch
is here.

21:04.431 --> 21:06.642
Uh...

21:06.725 --> 21:09.186
well, that's my mama.

21:09.269 --> 21:11.188
( chuckling )

21:33.502 --> 21:34.837
Hi. I'm Peter Griffin.

21:34.920 --> 21:36.922
You know, we've had
a lot of laughs tonight

21:37.005 --> 21:38.715
but I'll tell you
what's not funny.

21:38.799 --> 21:40.634
Killing strippers.

21:40.717 --> 21:42.302
Strippers are people, too.

21:42.386 --> 21:44.847
Naked people who may be willing
to pleasure you

21:44.930 --> 21:46.390
for a price you negotiate later

21:46.473 --> 21:48.016
behind the curtain
at a VIP room.

21:48.100 --> 21:50.227
Besides, there's no need
to kill them.

21:50.310 --> 21:52.396
'Cause most of them are already
dead inside.

21:52.479 --> 21:53.730
Good night, everyone.
