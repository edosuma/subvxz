00:05.506 --> 00:06.640
(screaming)

00:06.674 --> 00:08.409
ANNOUNCER:
American Horror Story: Cult.

00:08.442 --> 00:10.711
All new,
Tuesdays at 10:00 on FX.

00:13.247 --> 00:16.884
FXX presents You're the Worst.

00:19.087 --> 00:21.289
(Boone moaning)

00:22.556 --> 00:24.058
(both moaning)

00:24.092 --> 00:26.260
*

00:28.096 --> 00:31.499
(Gretchen gasps, moans)

00:31.532 --> 00:35.503
* Don't let space junk
punch holes in the wings... *

00:35.536 --> 00:37.071
*

00:37.105 --> 00:38.872
(panting)

00:38.906 --> 00:41.675
Hey. Uh, are you sure
it's okay that we're here?

00:41.709 --> 00:44.512
Yeah. We have the house
to ourselves for hours.

00:44.545 --> 00:47.515
Sure, but, uh, aren't you
worried about someone coming?

00:47.548 --> 00:49.517
Yeah. Me.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.085
(both laugh)

00:51.119 --> 00:53.221
-(Boone groans loudly)
-Oh. Oh, you were serious?

00:53.254 --> 00:55.889
-Well, okay then.
-(Boone moans, Gretchen laughs)

00:55.923 --> 00:59.093
(Boone panting)

00:59.127 --> 01:00.694
Sorry. Did you...?

01:00.728 --> 01:03.531
Oh, yeah. I had the floor
a few minutes ago.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.733
Yeah, remember when
I yelled "Boomtown"?

01:05.766 --> 01:07.535
-You're a weirdo.
-(laughs)

01:07.568 --> 01:09.637
-I'm gonna hop in the shower,
okay? -(chuckles)

01:09.670 --> 01:11.539
(sighs)

01:11.572 --> 01:13.241
(knob squeaks, shower running)

01:13.274 --> 01:14.775
(sighs)

01:16.810 --> 01:18.812
(chuckles softly)

01:20.581 --> 01:24.152
(phone clicking rapidly)

01:24.185 --> 01:26.187
(phone whooshes)

01:33.261 --> 01:35.329
*

01:44.605 --> 01:45.873
Amateur.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.350
*

02:04.358 --> 02:06.126
So I was thinking...

02:08.028 --> 02:10.030
Gretchen?

02:12.233 --> 02:15.203
Someone break into the house
and take you hostage?

02:17.638 --> 02:19.640
Did you tell them
I've watched John Wick

02:19.673 --> 02:22.410
and John Wick 2 so many times?

02:23.644 --> 02:25.713
(keys clinking)

02:28.249 --> 02:29.617
(gasps)
Jesus!

02:29.650 --> 02:31.285
You scared me.

02:31.319 --> 02:33.221
Why are you in a towel?

02:33.254 --> 02:35.656
Nothing. Just showering.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.625
-Listen, I can explain.
-Shut up!

02:37.658 --> 02:40.060
Damn it, Boone, I swear to God,
if it's one of my friends...

02:40.093 --> 02:42.062
Just calm down.
Let me speak.

02:42.095 --> 02:44.565
-She still here?
-No. I mean, who?

02:45.533 --> 02:47.701
(sighs)
Whatever.

02:47.735 --> 02:49.503
I don't even care.

02:49.537 --> 02:52.306
Olivia! Come on!

02:52.340 --> 02:55.809
Hey! Oh!

02:55.843 --> 02:58.846
Hi, Daddy.
Girl Scouts got cancelled.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.481
-Aw.
-Did you get my Bitmoji?

03:00.514 --> 03:02.149
I was going
to send you one of poop,

03:02.182 --> 03:03.651
but Mom said
that was beneath me.

03:03.684 --> 03:04.852
She's insane.

03:06.387 --> 03:07.721
Mom, come watch me play piano.

03:07.755 --> 03:09.390
I just learned "City of Stars."

03:09.423 --> 03:11.525
Isn't that, like, four notes?

03:14.695 --> 03:17.197
(piano playing)

03:17.231 --> 03:19.700
(piano music continues)

03:26.474 --> 03:28.776
(sighs)

03:28.809 --> 03:30.444
-Hi, Boone.
-Hey, Neil.

03:30.478 --> 03:31.879
Nice Subaru.

03:31.912 --> 03:33.447
-Thank you.
-Is it new?

03:33.481 --> 03:35.749
-Yeah. -I didn't know
you were a lesbian now.

03:35.783 --> 03:37.885
They are gonna love
your fat little tits.

03:37.918 --> 03:39.287
See, this is exactly why

03:39.320 --> 03:41.455
my therapist told me
not to talk to you.

03:41.489 --> 03:43.123
Oh.

03:43.156 --> 03:44.124
Neil?

03:44.157 --> 03:46.960
Neil? Neil?

03:46.994 --> 03:49.797
Neil? Neil? Neil? Neil? Neil?

03:49.830 --> 03:50.898
-What?!
-(mutters)

03:50.931 --> 03:52.733
-(laughs) Ow!
-What, Boone?

03:52.766 --> 03:54.602
I didn't mean it.
No, don't you dare!

03:54.635 --> 03:55.869
Stop! Stop it!

03:55.903 --> 03:57.971
Mm... (whimpers)

03:58.005 --> 04:00.308
-Where are the locks on
this thing?! -Whoa. That's it.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.209
-Damn it, let me go, you maniac!
-Aah!

04:02.242 --> 04:04.945
-(shouting)
-You are a child!

04:04.978 --> 04:07.781
-Oh, get off of me!
-My dick's on your leg.

04:07.815 --> 04:10.418
-Oh, my dick's on your leg.
My dick's on your leg! -No!

04:10.451 --> 04:12.152
-WHITNEY: See you tomorrow,
honey! -Oh.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.656
(both men panting, chuckling)

04:20.761 --> 04:22.796
See ya, buddy.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.798
Sorry about your leg.

04:24.832 --> 04:26.500
*

04:34.442 --> 04:37.611
* I'm gonna leave you anyway

04:37.645 --> 04:39.747
* I'm gonna leave you
anyway *

04:39.780 --> 04:42.115
* Gonna leave you anyway.

04:48.322 --> 04:50.190
(laughs)
Yeah, okay, get this.

04:50.223 --> 04:52.993
So we pull out to reveal
that the 7-Eleven--

04:53.026 --> 04:55.128
-it's actually a 9/11.
-Which is why

04:55.162 --> 04:56.964
the Slurpee machines
got hit by little airplanes.

04:56.997 --> 04:58.432
MAX:
Oh.

04:58.466 --> 04:59.633
I like it.

04:59.667 --> 05:02.102
7-Eleven, Building 7.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.771
-Maybe there's something there?
-EDGAR: Oh, hell yeah,

05:03.804 --> 05:05.272
-there's something there.
-You teach me every day.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.507
I saw this video on YouTube...

05:06.540 --> 05:08.676
Every day, you teach me.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.077
Any calls?

05:12.145 --> 05:13.481
No.

05:13.514 --> 05:14.548
Got to tell my buddy Brent

05:14.582 --> 05:16.617
-the good news about our sketch.
-Why?

05:16.650 --> 05:17.985
He's my main dude.

05:18.018 --> 05:19.453
So much of a best friendship

05:19.487 --> 05:20.821
is supporting each other
through disappointments,

05:20.854 --> 05:23.023
that you got to share the small,

05:23.056 --> 05:25.393
good things just
to balance it out.

05:25.426 --> 05:28.161
Sounds like me and Carlos.
Mencia.

05:28.195 --> 05:29.863
-Oh.
-We ride our Ducatis

05:29.897 --> 05:33.567
down PCH every Sunday,
and then we just chat for hours.

05:33.601 --> 05:34.868
-Just talking?
-Mm-hmm.

05:34.902 --> 05:36.804
This sounds weird to me
for some reason.

05:36.837 --> 05:39.039
It's because, as men,
we're conditioned

05:39.072 --> 05:41.509
to emotionally shut ourselves
off from each other.

05:41.542 --> 05:44.177
-It's why half of all men
die of loneliness. -Mm-hmm.

05:44.211 --> 05:46.814
These relationships
sound beautiful.

05:46.847 --> 05:49.417
-I want that.
-Me, too.

05:49.450 --> 05:52.052
I thought your roommate was
your main dude, the Australian.

05:52.085 --> 05:54.522
Oh, Jimmy? Yeah.

05:54.555 --> 05:56.657
But we don't have that kind
of relationship at all.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.392
If your needs aren't being met
in the relationship,

05:58.426 --> 05:59.827
you need to take a stand, bro.

05:59.860 --> 06:02.930
Okay. I'm gonna do it.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.598
I'm so proud of you, Edgar.

06:08.902 --> 06:12.005
It's no Ducati,
but, uh, I have an old ATV

06:12.039 --> 06:14.942
that's street legal if you
and Carlos ever want a third.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.710
We do not.

06:16.744 --> 06:18.746
Copy that.

06:20.313 --> 06:22.516
Stupid-ass stoner.

06:22.550 --> 06:24.217
So I'm tearing down the stairs

06:24.251 --> 06:26.920
-just as his wife is walking
up to the house. -(gasps)

06:26.954 --> 06:28.956
I have no way out,

06:28.989 --> 06:30.858
but I remember
there's a back door.

06:30.891 --> 06:33.126
Mm, there's always a back door.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.962
(Gretchen sighs)

06:34.995 --> 06:36.864
I thought
banging a hubby was hot,

06:36.897 --> 06:39.132
but now that I almost came
face-to-face with his wife,

06:39.166 --> 06:40.568
I don't know.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.202
I feel slightly...

06:42.235 --> 06:43.871
Ugh! What's the word?

06:43.904 --> 06:47.074
It's like bad,
but involves other people.

06:47.107 --> 06:49.877
-Carsick? Hard fart? Murder?
-No.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.244
The point is,

06:51.278 --> 06:53.714
you like taking that "D"
on the reg, right, dawg?

06:53.747 --> 06:55.883
-No diggity.
-Then enjoy that shit.

06:55.916 --> 06:58.085
If this hubster's
cheating on a frumpus

06:58.118 --> 07:00.454
who masturbates
with a children's vibrator,

07:00.488 --> 07:02.890
that's his problem.
You do you.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.893
You know what?
You're actually right.

07:05.926 --> 07:09.497
I know. Business has made me
hella smart.

07:09.530 --> 07:11.398
Pass the sweet salt.

07:11.431 --> 07:15.002
Plus, I have to admit,

07:15.035 --> 07:18.672
it was pretty hot almost getting
caught banging in their bed.

07:21.542 --> 07:24.077
(phone clicking rapidly)

07:24.111 --> 07:25.345
(phone whooshes)

07:25.378 --> 07:26.914
So, what's up with you?

07:26.947 --> 07:29.517
Not much.
Now that you're taking old dick,

07:29.550 --> 07:31.585
I don't really have anyone
to party with.

07:31.619 --> 07:34.321
What about your work friends?
They seem...

07:36.323 --> 07:37.991
Yeah, they're cool.

07:38.025 --> 07:41.461
Tara makes ugly metal art
and Jeff is a Halloween person,

07:41.495 --> 07:44.164
but we're not really friends.

07:44.197 --> 07:46.099
-How come?
-I don't know, I just feel like

07:46.133 --> 07:48.502
when I'm at work, I need
to keep shit locked down.

07:48.536 --> 07:49.937
Sounds like
Work Lindsay sucks.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.372
So, what you're saying is

07:52.405 --> 07:55.008
I should just be myself, and
they'll want to be my friends?

07:55.042 --> 07:57.044
(phone chimes, vibrates)

07:59.747 --> 08:02.716
Uh, okay! Sounds great!

08:02.750 --> 08:05.586
-Call you later.
-Have fun with that "D" for me.

08:11.659 --> 08:13.026
Jimmy?

08:13.060 --> 08:14.027
(door closes)

08:14.061 --> 08:16.864
(sighs)

08:16.897 --> 08:19.633
-Are you okay? -Edgar,
last night I had a revelation.

08:19.667 --> 08:22.202
Gretchen clearly brought
that man home for my benefit.

08:22.235 --> 08:24.838
-I thought she brought him home
to have sex with him. -Aha.

08:24.872 --> 08:26.406
That's what
she wanted us to think.

08:26.439 --> 08:28.508
I mean, they absolutely
did have sex. A lot.

08:28.542 --> 08:31.011
The noises were
highly disturbing.

08:31.044 --> 08:33.213
And he's a screamer.
But then around 3:00 a.m.,

08:33.246 --> 08:35.082
I realized it was a false flag.

08:35.115 --> 08:38.051
They could have
had sex anywhere, so why here?

08:38.085 --> 08:39.687
-Because she hates you?
-That's what I thought.

08:39.720 --> 08:43.223
But then, around 4:00 a.m.,
I realized, no,

08:43.256 --> 08:45.258
it is because she loves me.

08:45.292 --> 08:47.227
So I am not leaving this house

08:47.260 --> 08:48.729
until I blow the lid
off her ruse.

08:48.762 --> 08:51.031
What about the book expo?
It's your book release.

08:51.064 --> 08:52.833
-Staying here is
far more important. -Well,

08:52.866 --> 08:55.168
it sounds like you have
a lot going on

08:55.202 --> 08:58.005
and just need a friend
to talk through it with.

08:58.038 --> 09:01.508
Why don't we go get some steaks,
have a nice Cab, and...

09:01.541 --> 09:04.011
-we can hash it out?
-I didn't start listening

09:04.044 --> 09:06.013
until "steaks and Cab,"
but yes, very smart.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.415
Edgar, you're not as dumb
as I think you are.

09:08.448 --> 09:09.950
Thanks.

09:15.322 --> 09:18.225
-(elevator bell dings)
-(coughing)

09:19.627 --> 09:22.195
* En, en, en,
engine off, windows up *

09:22.229 --> 09:23.897
* That's the way
I like to puff *

09:23.931 --> 09:25.265
* Engine on, windows up...

09:25.298 --> 09:26.634
So, I'm at Coachella,

09:26.667 --> 09:28.769
and Hozier
kicks me out of his trailer,

09:28.802 --> 09:30.403
and I'm already sore,

09:30.437 --> 09:32.405
(chuckles): and then
there's Father John Misty,

09:32.439 --> 09:35.375
all cranked up and ready to go,
so I'm like,

09:35.408 --> 09:38.111
all right,
I guess we're doing this.

09:38.145 --> 09:40.213
* Now, can you handle that

09:40.247 --> 09:43.283
* The way I drop it to the floor
and then I bring it back *

09:43.316 --> 09:45.819
* I keep them boys I get from
over, you agree with that? *

09:45.853 --> 09:48.722
* I'm so bad, I'm mean,
you know what I mean? *

09:48.756 --> 09:51.591
* Or am I confusing?
I been noticing lately how *

09:51.625 --> 09:53.794
* I don't think that you can
handle that, can handle that *

09:53.827 --> 09:55.663
* Come on and make a move, or
don'tcha know just what to do? *

09:55.696 --> 09:57.397
* I'm on fire...

09:57.430 --> 09:58.598
Are you done?

09:59.633 --> 10:01.635
Item four.

10:01.669 --> 10:03.737
(Boone panting heavily)

10:03.771 --> 10:05.438
Nice sex moves.

10:05.472 --> 10:08.175
You're pretty limber
for an old guy.

10:08.208 --> 10:09.843
And loud.

10:11.444 --> 10:12.946
Can't you hang for a bit?

10:12.980 --> 10:14.281
Oh.

10:15.315 --> 10:16.884
Okay.

10:18.318 --> 10:19.653
It's just...

10:19.687 --> 10:21.689
I know we're
both grown-ups, but...

10:21.722 --> 10:23.523
I have some residual...

10:23.556 --> 10:25.759
murder feelings.

10:25.793 --> 10:27.094
Ugh!

10:27.127 --> 10:29.096
I feel like it starts
with a "G."

10:29.129 --> 10:30.864
Gauche. Gout?

10:30.898 --> 10:33.533
-Guilt?
-That sounds wrong.

10:33.566 --> 10:35.168
Guilt.

10:35.202 --> 10:37.137
Yeah.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.139
Guilt.

10:39.172 --> 10:41.608
I have guilt on Olivia.

10:41.641 --> 10:44.411
I don't feel like
I'm using it right.

10:45.679 --> 10:47.815
(sighs)

10:47.848 --> 10:50.150
She texted you yesterday.

10:50.183 --> 10:52.219
That's why I bailed.

10:52.252 --> 10:54.321
Sorry for snooping.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.556
-I'm a stinker.
-It's my fault.

10:56.589 --> 10:58.625
I've been trying
to keep her out of this.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.994
-Do you love her?
-Of course I love her.

11:01.028 --> 11:03.196
Then aren't you worried
about having to face her

11:03.230 --> 11:05.365
knowing we just had sex
in her house?

11:05.398 --> 11:08.001
(groans)
Why'd you bring that up?

11:08.035 --> 11:10.337
I'm just trying
to be real, dude.

11:10.370 --> 11:13.306
I mean... not to be gross,

11:13.340 --> 11:14.975
but at some point
she's gonna come home,

11:15.008 --> 11:16.576
get in bed, and what, lie in it?

11:16.609 --> 11:18.145
-Jesus, Gretchen!
-What?

11:18.178 --> 11:20.147
She is. She's gonna lie
right in it.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.649
-No, she isn't. -She sleeps here
with you, doesn't she?

11:22.682 --> 11:25.352
-I mean, every now and then.
-Enough to keep her toys here.

11:25.385 --> 11:27.554
-What?! -I found
one of her toys yesterday.

11:27.587 --> 11:28.989
So? They're all over the house.
What does that

11:29.022 --> 11:30.991
-have to do with anything?
-I don't know!

11:31.024 --> 11:34.027
I'm just not thrilled about the
idea of getting into your bed

11:34.061 --> 11:36.063
and seeing Olivia's pubes
everywhere.

11:36.096 --> 11:38.899
She doesn't have pubes!

11:38.932 --> 11:41.001
And I just said that.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.903
Wow! Okay.

11:42.936 --> 11:44.905
You know what? Forget it!

11:44.938 --> 11:46.907
I shouldn't have said anything!

11:46.940 --> 11:48.708
Where's your other bathroom?

11:48.742 --> 11:50.778
Just out there! You psycho!

11:50.811 --> 11:52.412
Psycho you!

11:53.446 --> 11:55.282
(knobs squeak, shower running)

12:00.754 --> 12:02.790
*

12:19.606 --> 12:22.209
So, you see, this can only mean

12:22.242 --> 12:25.245
that her levels of anger
are accelerating.

12:25.278 --> 12:28.481
She went from pure rage
to sex revenge in record time.

12:28.515 --> 12:30.884
Our inevitable reunion
can't be far off.

12:30.918 --> 12:33.053
-This sounds like an uncert...
-Plus, a family of raccoons

12:33.086 --> 12:34.888
has taken residence
in the box spring

12:34.922 --> 12:36.723
Gretchen jettisoned
into the yard,

12:36.756 --> 12:39.259
so that's a dangerous wild card.

12:39.292 --> 12:42.229
Why do you think she did that?
Like, I wonder if there's some

12:42.262 --> 12:45.098
-deeper meaning... -And Book
Lady can't seem to understand

12:45.132 --> 12:46.967
why I must stay here

12:47.000 --> 12:49.402
and forgo The Romance
and Erotica Book Expo.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.071
God, that's a bad name.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.273
You'd think a room full
of writers could do better.

12:53.306 --> 12:55.342
-Oh, well...
-Where the hell is our waiter?

12:55.375 --> 12:58.045
This mediocre Nebbiolo
isn't gonna refill itself.

12:59.046 --> 13:01.648
What are you doing?

13:01.681 --> 13:03.750
Jimmy, I've got
to say something here.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.285
We've lived together for...

13:05.318 --> 13:07.154
what, four years now?

13:07.187 --> 13:08.989
Hey, no. Look at me. Jimmy.

13:09.022 --> 13:11.024
Look at me.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.661
-I care about you.
-VERNON: Jimmy!

13:14.694 --> 13:16.129
What's up, ladies?

13:16.163 --> 13:17.297
Oh, thank God.

13:17.330 --> 13:19.366
Vernon and... Paul?

13:19.399 --> 13:21.001
Why do you look so...

13:21.034 --> 13:22.602
like that?

13:22.635 --> 13:24.804
Generally:
Men's Rights Activism.

13:24.838 --> 13:27.174
Specifically: Signaling.

13:27.207 --> 13:29.276
Tells people
I have my shit together.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.011
I cuss now.

13:31.044 --> 13:32.612
Sorry, guys,
but we were just in the middle

13:32.645 --> 13:33.680
-of something.
-Yeah, Bec forbade me

13:33.713 --> 13:35.148
from ever seeing him again.

13:35.182 --> 13:36.649
You know, on account
of loyalty and junk.

13:36.683 --> 13:39.319
So, one day we're both online,

13:39.352 --> 13:41.321
playing League of Legends,
and I realized

13:41.354 --> 13:43.123
I miss the little cuck.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.058
Reformed cuckold.

13:45.092 --> 13:46.626
Hey, why don't you two join us?

13:46.659 --> 13:48.061
Wait, but we were
just starting...

13:48.095 --> 13:50.463
Hell, yeah, four-way bro-down?

13:50.497 --> 13:53.466
We look like the poster
from Rounders. So tight!

13:53.500 --> 13:55.068
Excuse me.

13:55.102 --> 13:57.037
-Yes?
-I'll have a vodka soda.

13:57.070 --> 13:59.739
And no, I'm not trying
to rape you.

13:59.772 --> 14:01.508
(waitress sighs in disgust)

14:01.541 --> 14:03.210
Mmm.

14:03.243 --> 14:05.913
A little boy and a pedophile
are walking in the woods.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.647
The little boy says,

14:07.680 --> 14:09.849
"Mister, I'm scared."

14:09.883 --> 14:11.551
So the pedophile says,

14:11.584 --> 14:15.355
"You're scared?
I have to walk back by myself."

14:15.388 --> 14:16.589
Oh, my God.

14:16.623 --> 14:17.857
I know.
(laughs)

14:17.891 --> 14:19.359
He has a kid!

14:19.392 --> 14:21.394
No, Gretchen, he killed the kid.

14:21.428 --> 14:23.163
That's the joke.

14:23.196 --> 14:26.066
No. Boone. He has a daughter!

14:26.099 --> 14:28.368
Ooh!

14:28.401 --> 14:31.371
I was just starting to be okay
with the wife thing.

14:31.404 --> 14:33.673
Now I have to be okay
with him having a kid?

14:33.706 --> 14:36.776
No. No. Gretch, some
ding-dong wife is one thing,

14:36.809 --> 14:39.679
but a kid,
that's way too much drama.

14:39.712 --> 14:42.449
But... now that he has a kid,

14:42.482 --> 14:45.252
isn't it like
he's even more unavailable?

14:45.285 --> 14:47.020
-No!
-Okay, but just hear me out.

14:47.054 --> 14:49.456
-No. No! No, no. No.
-Oh. Oh...

14:49.489 --> 14:51.258
-(grunts)
-All right!

14:51.291 --> 14:53.060
Jesus! I won't!

14:54.427 --> 14:56.763
But what if I try to end it
and he cries,

14:56.796 --> 14:58.365
and then I...

14:58.398 --> 15:00.968
Oh, never mind.
No one ever fights for me.

15:02.135 --> 15:04.371
Hey, how's the...

15:04.404 --> 15:06.573
"making friends with
your coworkers" thing going?

15:06.606 --> 15:09.376
Great. I'm totally being myself.
They love it.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.711
You missed
my Chris Rock impression.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.146
Seen it. Hey.

15:13.180 --> 15:15.148
Does Carl have anything good
in the fridge?

15:15.182 --> 15:18.085
Homemade lasagna from his mom.
It's amazing.

15:18.118 --> 15:19.686
But there's only
one piece left, so hurry.

15:28.095 --> 15:30.097
(rock strikes window)

15:38.438 --> 15:40.974
Why are you throwing rocks
at my house?

15:41.008 --> 15:42.575
I can't see you anymore.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.411
'Cause I just talked
to my friend,

15:44.444 --> 15:46.513
who once dated
a Romanian gymnastics coach,

15:46.546 --> 15:48.681
and even she thinks
this is a bad idea.

15:48.715 --> 15:51.084
Anyway, I just wish
you'd told me you had a kid.

15:51.118 --> 15:54.154
I did. We just had
a whole conversation about her.

15:54.187 --> 15:55.655
No, we talked about your wife.

15:55.688 --> 15:57.991
I'm not married.
When did we talk about my wife?

15:58.025 --> 15:59.926
First of all,
you told me about your wedding

15:59.959 --> 16:01.861
the day that we met.
And second of all,

16:01.894 --> 16:04.431
we just talked all about her,
like four hours ago.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.433
First of all,
people get divorced.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.935
And second of all,
I was talking about my daughter,

16:08.968 --> 16:11.271
Olivia, who's awesome.

16:11.304 --> 16:14.041
My ex-wife's name
is Whitney, who sucks.

16:14.074 --> 16:16.809
So this whole time...

16:16.843 --> 16:19.046
you're not married?

16:19.079 --> 16:21.948
-No. -Then why have we been
sneaking around

16:21.981 --> 16:23.850
and boning in hotels
and cars and shit?

16:23.883 --> 16:25.452
Because it was sexy
and exciting.

16:25.485 --> 16:26.953
Wait. You thought I was married

16:26.986 --> 16:28.521
and you were just cool with it?

16:28.555 --> 16:30.357
It was sexy and exciting.

16:30.390 --> 16:32.359
Why'd you want me to be married
so badly?

16:32.392 --> 16:34.694
Because with a married dude,
there's no future in it.

16:34.727 --> 16:36.029
Ouch.

16:36.063 --> 16:38.198
You know what?

16:38.231 --> 16:40.800
This is all just
too much right now.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.669
Sorry.

16:48.941 --> 16:50.943
(door squeaks and closes)

16:53.513 --> 16:55.082
Exactly.

17:05.192 --> 17:07.560
Just one cigarette.

17:14.201 --> 17:16.503
PAUL:
Men work harder,

17:16.536 --> 17:18.338
men die earlier.

17:18.371 --> 17:21.374
But do we worry
about men's health? (laughs)

17:21.408 --> 17:25.545
Did you know that 50%
of domestic violence

17:25.578 --> 17:28.047
-is woman on man?
-Absolutely not true.

17:28.081 --> 17:30.117
I can't believe I haven't
seen you in three months.

17:30.150 --> 17:32.952
Gretchen was on the pod
talking mad shit

17:32.985 --> 17:35.355
the other day
that you proposed to her

17:35.388 --> 17:36.923
and then bailed, but I know
that couldn't be right.

17:36.956 --> 17:38.925
-No, that's accurate.
-So epic!

17:38.958 --> 17:41.528
So, Jimmy's actions
are vilified,

17:41.561 --> 17:44.697
and yet Julia Roberts's antics
in Runaway Brid are delightful

17:44.731 --> 17:47.367
and quirky... Nauseating.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.136
Hey, Jimmy. You want to go
somewhere and get a real drink?

17:49.169 --> 17:50.437
-Continue our conver...
-Edgar.

17:50.470 --> 17:52.539
I was being deliberately
obtuse before,

17:52.572 --> 17:54.741
-but I know what you're doing.
-You do?

17:54.774 --> 17:56.809
You're trying to deepen
our relationship,

17:56.843 --> 17:58.278
become more intimate.

17:58.311 --> 17:59.812
Yes, exactly.

17:59.846 --> 18:01.548
-I'm so happy you...
-Edgar, look at me.

18:01.581 --> 18:04.217
From the bottom of my heart,

18:04.251 --> 18:06.753
this thing you want between us,

18:06.786 --> 18:10.557
is never ever going to happen.

18:10.590 --> 18:13.560
I truly appreciate the effort,
but no thank you.

18:13.593 --> 18:14.694
(laughs, snorts)

18:21.601 --> 18:23.370
Screw you, Jimmy.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.574
Anyway,

18:27.607 --> 18:29.809
I'm not proud of my
cowardly behavior,

18:29.842 --> 18:33.746
so I'm biding my time whilst
Gretchen punishes me.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.316
To tell you the truth,

18:36.349 --> 18:40.453
it's massively painful to see
her with someone else.

18:40.487 --> 18:43.022
I gave myself a hernia
crying so hard

18:43.055 --> 18:44.824
after one of Lindsay's sessions.

18:44.857 --> 18:46.659
That's really rough, Jimmy.

18:46.693 --> 18:48.295
Thanks.

18:48.328 --> 18:51.698
Aw, you guys.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.032
Edgar was right.

18:53.065 --> 18:55.001
Male bonding can be enjoyable.

18:55.034 --> 18:57.170
It's too bad he left
before things got deep.

18:57.204 --> 18:59.138
-Actually, I'm having
a hard time -(phone chimes)

18:59.172 --> 19:00.607
with Becca lately.

19:00.640 --> 19:01.808
She's been, uh...

19:01.841 --> 19:03.042
Bye.

19:03.075 --> 19:04.677
Cool.

19:04.711 --> 19:07.113
Whatever.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.781
Hey.

19:08.815 --> 19:11.651
Let's go run game on some
creep-shaming lezzies.

19:13.420 --> 19:14.687
Well,

19:14.721 --> 19:16.523
there's a couple of Clydesdales

19:16.556 --> 19:17.857
that need shoeing.

19:17.890 --> 19:18.958
(grunts)

19:18.991 --> 19:20.560
-(woman gasps)
-(laughs and snorts)

19:25.498 --> 19:27.634
(typing)

19:27.667 --> 19:29.669
(sighs)

19:30.703 --> 19:32.905
Hey, guys. Want to grab

19:32.939 --> 19:35.074
-a drink or something?
-Oh, can't.

19:35.107 --> 19:37.377
I'm on a strict early agrarian
sleep cycle.

19:37.410 --> 19:40.247
JEFF: Man, I could really use
one, but I got band practice.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.681
I'm already late.

19:41.714 --> 19:43.650
Hey, you were funny today.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.852
TARA: Yeah. Jeff told me
your pedo joke.

19:45.885 --> 19:48.187
Hysterical.

19:48.221 --> 19:49.522
Thanks.

19:54.060 --> 19:56.062
(sighs)

19:57.297 --> 19:59.299
(sighs)

20:01.401 --> 20:03.403
(man singing karaoke nearby)

20:07.073 --> 20:09.942
* And you know I like
your style *

20:09.976 --> 20:12.011
* Yeah, you know I like
your style and *

20:12.044 --> 20:13.246
* All the jewelry

20:13.280 --> 20:14.514
* And the platinum

20:14.547 --> 20:15.715
* Don't move me

20:15.748 --> 20:17.049
* I'm a real one

20:17.083 --> 20:18.951
* They all like my style

20:18.985 --> 20:21.454
* And, yeah,
I know you like my style. *

20:22.455 --> 20:24.857
Jimmy sucks.

20:24.891 --> 20:27.260
I just wish I had someone
I could really connect with.

20:27.294 --> 20:28.528
Right?

20:28.561 --> 20:30.397
It's like, no one gets me.

20:30.430 --> 20:31.964
Peanut shell?

20:31.998 --> 20:34.133
I went to the circus for lunch.

20:34.166 --> 20:35.402
(both laugh)

20:39.306 --> 20:42.241
See? I just want to have
stupid fun like this

20:42.275 --> 20:44.444
-with my dumb coworkers.
-I know.

20:44.477 --> 20:46.979
Why is it so hard to find
someone to get close with?

20:47.013 --> 20:49.316
You dropped something.

20:51.651 --> 20:53.753
(makes farting sound)

20:54.821 --> 20:56.789
(both laughing)

20:56.823 --> 20:58.491
-Ow.
-Oh.

21:02.329 --> 21:04.497
* If you want to go away
from your shell *

21:04.531 --> 21:08.167
* To free yourself, finally
get out of your cell *

21:08.200 --> 21:10.903
* You said there's a place
where you used to hide *

21:10.937 --> 21:13.440
* Where no one ever asks
what you got on your mind *

21:13.473 --> 21:14.607
* You said it's

21:14.641 --> 21:16.108
* Take me for a ride

21:16.142 --> 21:17.744
* Take me by your side,
take me with you *

21:17.777 --> 21:19.245
* Take me for a ride

21:19.278 --> 21:20.847
* Take me by your side,
take me with you *

21:20.880 --> 21:22.349
* Take me for a ride

21:22.382 --> 21:24.751
* Take me by your side,
take me with you *

21:24.784 --> 21:26.519
* Take me for a ride,
take me by your side *

21:26.553 --> 21:28.355
* Take me with you.

21:33.526 --> 21:34.927
Whatcha doin'?

21:34.961 --> 21:37.096
I told myself
that if you came out

21:37.129 --> 21:39.098
and asked me to stay, I would.

21:39.131 --> 21:42.101
It's just, I've never had anyone
fight for me and I thought:

21:42.134 --> 21:45.772
maybe someone would someday.
(sniffles)

21:45.805 --> 21:48.174
Maybe that's a thing
I'm deserving of.

21:48.207 --> 21:50.677
But then I thought, "Hey,

21:50.710 --> 21:53.646
maybe you just don't give people
a chance to fight for you."

21:53.680 --> 21:55.147
So I thought I'd give you

21:55.181 --> 21:56.849
a couple cigarettes' worth
of a chance.

21:59.686 --> 22:00.720
Oh, my God.

22:08.227 --> 22:10.229
(sighs)

22:11.230 --> 22:14.333
(flatly):
Don't go, Gretchen.

22:14.367 --> 22:16.903
You fought for me.

22:16.936 --> 22:18.938
(both chuckle)

22:31.584 --> 22:33.185
You want to stay over?

22:33.219 --> 22:35.354
Olivia went with Whitney

22:35.388 --> 22:37.590
to Neil's French horn recital.

22:37.624 --> 22:38.891
I hate him so much.

22:38.925 --> 22:40.359
Sure.

22:41.394 --> 22:43.496
Wait.

22:43.530 --> 22:46.499
Whose vibrator did I find
in the bedside table?

22:46.533 --> 22:47.600
Mine.

22:47.634 --> 22:49.035
Oh.

22:50.470 --> 22:52.271
Oh...

22:52.304 --> 22:54.373
* And I heard you're moving on

22:54.407 --> 22:56.776
* On to someone new

22:59.612 --> 23:02.649
* I don't blame her

23:03.883 --> 23:05.885
* At all

23:07.887 --> 23:10.423
* Sitting wide awake

23:10.457 --> 23:12.391
* In a crowded space

23:12.425 --> 23:14.694
* I know that I can make it

23:14.727 --> 23:18.631
* Find myself
just thinking of you *

23:18.665 --> 23:21.100
* Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

23:21.133 --> 23:22.602
Candace.

23:22.635 --> 23:25.438
Listen, I've changed my mind
about the expo.

23:25.472 --> 23:27.774
I'll, um...

23:27.807 --> 23:31.310
I-I'll see you Sunday.

23:31.343 --> 23:33.412
* And he becomes the man

23:33.446 --> 23:36.916
* That I could never be

23:39.519 --> 23:41.488
* And if I could
do it different *

23:41.521 --> 23:44.423
* I never would
have let you go *

23:45.492 --> 23:49.596
* I don't blame her

23:49.629 --> 23:53.432
* At all

23:53.466 --> 23:57.637
* Couldn't tame her

23:57.670 --> 24:01.608
* At all

24:01.641 --> 24:05.311
* I don't blame her

24:05.344 --> 24:07.079
* At all.

Hey, fellas.

24:23.029 --> 24:25.632
I'm on antidepressants,
so I won't even cry after.

24:25.665 --> 24:28.467
-Are you a fan of poetry?
-Which one first?

24:28.501 --> 24:32.204
We shall not go gentle
into this good night.

24:32.905 --> 24:34.507
If you know what I mean.

Mom.

25:02.434 --> 25:03.536
What?

25:03.570 --> 25:05.672
Can we adopt
a Syrian refugee baby?

25:05.705 --> 25:06.873
No!

25:06.906 --> 25:08.575
Mom, they're dying
every day.

25:08.608 --> 25:12.011
You're literally
murdering a baby
