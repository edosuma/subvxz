01:21.658 --> 01:25.492
Tension that had been brewing for
months in Nigeria exploded yesterday...

01:25.658 --> 01:29.697
...as exiled Gen. Mustafa Yakubu
orchestrated a swift and violent coup...

01:29.858 --> 01:34.056
...against the democratically elected
government of President Samuel Azuka.

01:34.218 --> 01:38.257
In the land with 1 20 million people
and over 250 ethnic groups...

01:38.418 --> 01:41.091
... there'd been a long history
of ethnic enmity...

01:41.258 --> 01:45.570
...particularly between northern Fulani
Moslems and southern Christian Ibo.

01:46.378 --> 01:48.812
The victorious Fulani rebels
have tak en to the streets...

01:48.978 --> 01:52.448
...as outbursts of violence
continue all over the country.

01:53.138 --> 01:57.450
Thousands have been killed in
the fighting or executed thereafter.

01:57.618 --> 02:01.248
Fearing ethnic cleansing, most Ibo
have abandoned their homes...

02:01.419 --> 02:05.571
...and are fleeing the city or searching
for sanctuary wherever they may find it.

02:05.739 --> 02:08.811
Gen. Yakubu has tak en control
of most of the country...

02:08.979 --> 02:10.697
...and appears firmly in charge.

02:10.859 --> 02:13.612
There's no word on the United Nations'
reaction to the coup...

02:13.779 --> 02:17.613
...but United States forces have already
begun to evacuate its embassy.

02:34.739 --> 02:38.015
As you can see behind me,
on the USS Harry S. Truman...

02:38.259 --> 02:43.458
...activity is high as foreign nationals
are evacuated from all over Nigeria.

02:43.619 --> 02:45.132
This once peaceful country...

02:45.299 --> 02:49.690
...has been rocked by a series of ethnic
unrests and brief but bitter battles...

02:49.899 --> 02:52.971
...mainly over control
of Nigeria's vast oil supply.

02:53.379 --> 02:55.415
However, nothing can prepare
the country...

02:55.619 --> 02:59.851
...for the overwhelming and decisive
action that has just taken place.

03:02.579 --> 03:06.015
We have just heard
that the entire presidential family...

03:06.179 --> 03:08.329
...has been assassinated.
l repeat:

03:08.499 --> 03:11.969
The entire presidential family
has been assassinated.

03:28.740 --> 03:30.412
-Welcome aboard, Mr. Ambassador.
-Thank you.

03:30.620 --> 03:32.019
Let me take those for you.

03:32.420 --> 03:34.172
He got one in the leg!

03:35.020 --> 03:37.136
Put him in the sickbay now!

03:41.180 --> 03:42.579
Well, look at you.

03:42.740 --> 03:44.458
-Welcome back.
-Thank you.

03:45.580 --> 03:49.459
We appreciate you've been humping out
there, but we have to put you back in.

03:49.900 --> 03:54.371
Priority tasking. We need to extract
a critical personality ASAP.

03:54.620 --> 03:57.771
Now get some chow,
refit for a three-day LLRP.

03:58.220 --> 04:00.814
See you in chow to debrief.
You...

04:01.180 --> 04:03.489
-...go see the medic.
-Aye, captain.

04:12.300 --> 04:13.574
Attention on deck.

04:13.740 --> 04:16.208
As you were, gentlemen. Sit down.

04:21.339 --> 04:22.534
Everybody get chow?

04:22.700 --> 04:24.770
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

04:24.940 --> 04:28.933
Now, intel estimates
5000 Yakubu troops...

04:29.140 --> 04:30.129
...scattered throughout this sector.

04:31.660 --> 04:33.457
They've captured
government armories...

04:33.660 --> 04:37.573
...and unfortunately, we have been
supplying them for far too many years.

04:38.540 --> 04:44.457
ln addition, the local militia are killing
anyone who goes to a different church.

04:44.661 --> 04:48.131
All right, now, your prime objective
is to find and extract...

04:48.301 --> 04:52.772
...Dr. Lena Fiore Kendricks with
lnternational Relief Services.

04:53.101 --> 04:55.376
Dr. Kendricks is an American
by marriage.

04:55.661 --> 04:58.539
Her late husband
was Dr. John Kendricks.

04:58.701 --> 05:00.020
Your secondary objective...

05:00.181 --> 05:03.491
...is to extract two nuns and a priest
who run a feel-good near Yolingo...

05:03.701 --> 05:05.578
...if they so choose to leave.

05:05.741 --> 05:07.971
St. Michael's Mission, right here.

05:08.181 --> 05:09.899
You will halo over Cameroon...

05:10.061 --> 05:13.371
...and float into your DZ near the edge
of the Mazon Rain Forest.

05:13.541 --> 05:14.690
When you get your package...

05:14.861 --> 05:18.854
...you will proceed
to your extract LZ Alpha.

05:19.021 --> 05:22.855
Our presence on the ground
will be considered hostile.

05:24.181 --> 05:25.853
-Questions?
-Sir...

05:26.021 --> 05:27.090
...rules of engagement?

05:27.261 --> 05:31.379
You will defend yourselves if you're
fired upon. Otherwise, do not engage.

05:31.661 --> 05:33.413
Sir, what's our escape-and-evasion
plan?

05:33.621 --> 05:36.931
Patrol the Cameroon border
through the Tandjile Pass.

05:37.741 --> 05:39.652
Anything else, gentlemen?

05:42.341 --> 05:43.330
All right.

05:44.421 --> 05:45.410
Dismissed.

05:56.181 --> 05:57.899
Gentlemen, three minutes out.

07:32.063 --> 07:33.416
lt's okay. lt's okay.

07:33.583 --> 07:35.972
You speak English?
You speak English?

07:36.143 --> 07:38.532
Good. Good.
l'm not gonna hurt you.

07:39.823 --> 07:42.542
Are there any soldiers here?
Any rebel soldiers?

07:42.703 --> 07:44.933
You sure? You sure?

07:45.103 --> 07:48.095
Good. Good. Can you take me
to Dr. Lena Kendricks?

07:48.263 --> 07:50.094
Do you know who she is?
Okay, here we go.

07:50.263 --> 07:52.219
Nice and easy. Come on.

07:52.623 --> 07:54.215
Zee, we're moving.

07:54.463 --> 07:57.102
lt's all right. l'm not gonna
hurt you, okay?

08:10.743 --> 08:11.971
Open.

08:19.783 --> 08:20.772
Clear.

08:45.184 --> 08:46.378
Lasana, where's that wa--?

08:46.544 --> 08:48.535
These American men are here
to see you!

08:48.784 --> 08:52.618
l'm Lt. Waters with the U.S. Navy.
l'm here to get you and your people out.

08:53.104 --> 08:55.015
We're in the middle of surgery here.

08:55.184 --> 08:57.334
Ma'am, you don't realize
what's about to happen here.

08:57.504 --> 08:59.256
Are you a nun?
Are you one of the nuns?

08:59.464 --> 09:00.783
-Are you a nun, ma'am?
-Yes, sir.

09:00.944 --> 09:03.856
Good. Pack your things
and let's get out of here now.

09:04.024 --> 09:05.662
-Lieutenant!
-Ma'am.

09:05.824 --> 09:09.419
Get those weapons out
of my operating room.

09:09.664 --> 09:11.177
You're frightening my staff.

09:11.664 --> 09:15.816
l'll be with you when l'm done.
Now please wait outside!

09:16.064 --> 09:17.816
Your staff should be frightened,
ma'am.

09:17.984 --> 09:21.215
Do you know what'll happen to you
and these women when rebels get here?

09:26.304 --> 09:28.215
Doc, maybe you can help her out.

09:28.424 --> 09:30.380
Ma'am, may l assist?

09:31.264 --> 09:33.095
-Are you a doctor?
-No, l'm a corpsman, ma'am.

09:33.584 --> 09:35.256
-Can you stitch?
-Yes, ma'am.

09:35.504 --> 09:37.415
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, he's sure.

09:40.624 --> 09:41.773
Then close for me.

09:43.584 --> 09:45.415
We're taking our good old time here.

09:50.144 --> 09:52.783
All right, Lt. Waters, l'm all yours.

09:55.905 --> 09:56.940
Hurry up, Doc.

10:01.505 --> 10:04.144
l assume you have a plan
to get us all out of here?

10:04.305 --> 10:06.136
Yes, ma'am. Come with me, please.

10:06.305 --> 10:09.502
We've got a 1 2-klick hike to make
to rendezvous to the helicopter.

10:09.745 --> 10:11.815
Get your things together,
but pack light.

10:13.105 --> 10:16.620
Zee, bring your perimeter up.
Keep Flea in place.

10:16.785 --> 10:19.424
We spotted a rebel company
outside of Yolingo on the way in.

10:19.585 --> 10:22.224
We must assume they'll be here
by night, if not sooner.

10:22.385 --> 10:26.139
l'm responsible for 7 0 people here, more
than half of them seriously wounded.

10:26.305 --> 10:29.024
My orders are to evacuate
foreign nationals only, ma'am.

10:29.185 --> 10:30.698
What does that mean?

10:30.865 --> 10:33.095
l mean nonindigenous personnel,
ma'am.

10:33.265 --> 10:34.459
Then we have a problem.

10:34.625 --> 10:39.016
l will not leave without
the indigenous personnel.

10:39.185 --> 10:43.064
We're here to get you out.
Now, l suggest you go find the priest...

10:43.225 --> 10:45.978
...go find the nuns, pack your things
and prepare to move.

10:46.145 --> 10:50.377
When the rebel troops get here,
they'll kill everything they see...

10:50.545 --> 10:52.456
...including privileged white doctors.

10:52.625 --> 10:55.662
-What part of that plan don't you get?
-The Cameroon border's 40 miles away!

10:55.825 --> 10:58.862
-You could fly them out in 30 minutes!
-Can't do that.

10:59.025 --> 11:00.856
-Why not?
-Because my orders are very clear:

11:01.025 --> 11:05.496
Evacuate the priest, you and the two
nuns. Now pack and get ready to move.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.815
We can take those who can walk.

11:07.985 --> 11:10.704
They're not my responsibility.
You are my responsibility.

11:17.266 --> 11:19.336
You're right, lieutenant...

11:19.586 --> 11:22.737
...it's not your problem.
lt is my responsibility...

11:22.906 --> 11:25.579
...and l will not leave
without my people.

11:32.706 --> 11:33.980
All right, give me a minute.

11:35.186 --> 11:36.619
-A minute?
-That's right.

11:37.106 --> 11:41.418
Sixty seconds. l suggest you use
that time to go find the priest.

11:45.826 --> 11:48.101
Get Command on the horn.

11:48.466 --> 11:49.581
Eagle One to Command.

11:49.746 --> 11:52.465
-Lena, what's going on?
-l don't know yet.

11:52.626 --> 11:54.423
Eagle One to Command.

11:58.626 --> 11:59.979
Eagle One.

12:00.866 --> 12:02.538
Yeah, captain, we got a problem.

12:02.706 --> 12:03.741
No, we got her.

12:04.306 --> 12:07.503
But she wants to bring the 7 0 people
here along with her.

12:08.946 --> 12:10.459
Yes, sir, l understand.

12:10.706 --> 12:12.139
l will handle it.

12:12.466 --> 12:13.740
Eagle One, out.

12:23.186 --> 12:24.778
Dr. Kendricks.

12:30.906 --> 12:34.456
You win. Get your people together.
We leave in a half an hour.

12:34.627 --> 12:36.697
There will be helicopters for them too?

12:37.187 --> 12:40.145
Yes. We can only take those who can
move under their own power.

12:41.107 --> 12:42.699
l understand.

12:43.507 --> 12:44.542
Thank you, lieutenant.

12:44.787 --> 12:46.379
Hurry, please.

12:54.387 --> 12:57.265
Why don't we just get Doc
to tranq her the fuck out?

12:57.427 --> 13:00.863
That's a great idea, Red. Drugging
and kidnapping an American doctor.

13:01.067 --> 13:02.978
l ain't sure this bitch is American.

13:03.907 --> 13:06.865
The doctor is the mission, Red.
Stick with her.

13:08.067 --> 13:11.264
-And we're taking all these people out?
-Go on.

13:13.827 --> 13:16.341
We need everyone able
to travel ready to go.

13:16.507 --> 13:18.896
We must leave quickly.
Quickly!

13:19.067 --> 13:21.058
God will bless you, Lena.

13:28.227 --> 13:31.537
-What did the captain say?
-What the fuck you think he said?

13:37.267 --> 13:40.816
Okay, let's clear these hooches.

14:51.548 --> 14:53.106
Come here, you guys.

14:53.708 --> 14:56.939
lt's okay. lt's okay. Come on.

14:59.468 --> 15:02.028
Hour and a half off the rendezvous
with the bird.

15:03.348 --> 15:06.181
-Can only bring what they carry by back.
-Roger that.

15:07.308 --> 15:10.505
-Where's that priest?
-He says he ain't coming.

15:14.349 --> 15:16.180
Bless you, Lena.

15:16.629 --> 15:17.948
Thank you for everything.

15:18.149 --> 15:20.947
Don't cry, Sister, please.
We'll see each other again.

15:21.109 --> 15:22.667
Take care of yourself.

15:30.349 --> 15:32.863
-You got it, Lake?
-Hundred percent, sir.

15:33.109 --> 15:34.144
All right. Let's go.

15:34.349 --> 15:36.419
Take us out of here,
but don't run away from us.

15:36.589 --> 15:38.181
Roger that.

15:42.229 --> 15:44.538
Keep them moving. Keep them moving.

15:44.709 --> 15:45.778
Come on.

15:47.669 --> 15:50.263
Keep them moving, Slo.
Get her out of there.

15:50.469 --> 15:53.267
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Hey. Come on, let's go.

15:53.429 --> 15:54.657
-Come on, now.
-Catch up!

15:55.069 --> 15:56.468
Sister Grace.

15:56.629 --> 15:59.143
-The mother?
-She is dead.

15:59.509 --> 16:00.942
Oh, no.

16:01.349 --> 16:02.941
Oh, no.

16:03.149 --> 16:05.299
What am l going to do
with this child?

16:05.469 --> 16:06.618
Lena.

16:06.789 --> 16:10.862
Lena, you'll have to take this child.
lt's the only chance she has.

16:11.989 --> 16:13.945
We gotta move quicker than this.

16:16.269 --> 16:19.022
We gotta get back for the Falcon game.
Come on.

16:19.349 --> 16:21.146
Take care of yourself, girl.

16:28.189 --> 16:29.941
Sister Siobhan.

16:33.670 --> 16:35.308
Mind yourself.

16:39.670 --> 16:42.742
Let's go, Sister. Pick your bag up.
Let's go now.

16:42.910 --> 16:44.423
l'm not going.

16:44.950 --> 16:45.939
Sister!

16:46.110 --> 16:48.305
-L.T., she doesn't want to leave.
-l'm not going.

16:48.470 --> 16:49.619
What?

16:54.070 --> 16:55.503
Good luck.

16:55.830 --> 16:58.139
-God bless you.
-Thanks be to God.

17:00.150 --> 17:01.788
All right, let's make it quick.

17:01.950 --> 17:03.668
Come on, ma'am, let's go.

17:04.470 --> 17:07.303
Come on. We have plenty of work
to do now. Come on.

17:08.190 --> 17:09.542
Take care.

17:18.710 --> 17:20.143
Go with God.

17:22.470 --> 17:25.666
-God already left Africa.
-Yeah.

18:38.271 --> 18:40.421
Go easy, doc. Watch your step.

18:41.791 --> 18:43.429
l got her.

18:56.951 --> 19:01.149
We're only five klicks in. lt's seven
and a half miles to LZ Alpha.

19:01.351 --> 19:04.468
We go any slower, we'll start going
backwards in time.

19:04.631 --> 19:07.429
-Red, what do you got back there?
-Five stragglers.

19:07.591 --> 19:11.221
-30 meters and falling from main body.
-All right, roll them up ASAP.

19:12.312 --> 19:13.461
Let's go.

19:14.712 --> 19:16.782
Come on. You've gotta speed up.

19:16.952 --> 19:20.069
Ma'am, speed up.
You too. You--

19:46.552 --> 19:48.349
Watch those trees.

20:02.272 --> 20:03.910
l'm gonna help you.

20:14.832 --> 20:17.266
lt's all right. l'll tell them.

20:19.872 --> 20:21.146
We got you.

20:22.512 --> 20:23.581
Lieutenant.

20:24.472 --> 20:26.064
We need to stop.

20:28.233 --> 20:29.586
-Lieutenant!
-l heard you.

20:30.873 --> 20:34.149
We can't stop.
Behind schedule. Come on.

20:34.633 --> 20:36.544
These people need to rest.

20:36.713 --> 20:38.908
And we have a child
who needs medication.

20:39.433 --> 20:40.627
Here we go.

20:42.593 --> 20:45.153
There you go, ma'am.
Let's go.

20:46.673 --> 20:48.345
Let's go, doctor.

20:52.633 --> 20:55.101
Come on, sir. Here we go.

20:58.393 --> 21:00.304
What you want to do?

21:02.273 --> 21:04.070
Rest for 30.

21:04.233 --> 21:05.666
Lake, hold it up.

21:06.233 --> 21:07.871
We're gonna rest for 30.

21:08.033 --> 21:09.591
Set a perimeter.

21:11.633 --> 21:12.622
Perimeter up.

21:13.673 --> 21:16.631
Ma'am, we gonna take 30.

22:39.954 --> 22:43.424
L.T., we got guerrilla rebels inbound...

22:43.954 --> 22:45.307
... on our path.

22:45.794 --> 22:48.945
Dr. Kendricks, come with me
right away. Come here.

22:49.714 --> 22:53.866
There's danger on the trail. You must do
everything you can to-- Listen to me!

22:54.034 --> 22:57.231
You must do everything you can to keep
that baby quiet, you understand me?

22:57.394 --> 22:59.669
Whatever it takes. Go now.

23:08.595 --> 23:10.187
Get up. Get up.

23:11.995 --> 23:13.508
Danger close.

23:27.035 --> 23:28.593
Go.

25:50.837 --> 25:52.270
Clear.

26:00.797 --> 26:03.834
Oh, fuck. L.T., straggler, straggler.
Danger close.

26:38.157 --> 26:41.513
Go on, ma'am. Go.
Now is good. Go!

26:42.397 --> 26:44.957
Lake, lead us out before they
realize their tailgunner's gone.

26:45.637 --> 26:47.946
And find us a safe place to rest.

26:48.757 --> 26:51.635
Wait! They're going to the mission.
You have to stop them.

26:51.797 --> 26:55.346
l can't do that. lt'd risk the safety
of all these people here.

26:55.957 --> 26:59.347
-Besides, they may bypass the mission.
-You know they won't.

27:00.157 --> 27:03.355
There are a lot of possible scenarios
that could happen, Dr. Kendricks.

27:03.518 --> 27:06.078
l don't presume
to know them all. Red?

27:06.638 --> 27:08.071
Dr. Kendricks.

27:08.318 --> 27:09.910
-Let's go.
-Ma'am.

27:10.238 --> 27:11.387
Come on.

28:06.318 --> 28:08.912
Can't you sleep, lieutenant?

28:09.078 --> 28:11.034
lt's my watch, ma'am.

28:11.998 --> 28:13.909
You can call me Lena.

28:16.678 --> 28:18.987
Dr. Kendricks, l suggest
you get some rest.

28:21.078 --> 28:22.717
You know....

28:30.199 --> 28:31.837
Thank you for saving my life.

28:36.399 --> 28:38.435
lt wasn't about saving your life.

28:40.319 --> 28:42.549
lt's about getting the job done.

28:43.039 --> 28:45.917
Completing the mission, that's all.

29:02.039 --> 29:03.518
My dear...

29:03.879 --> 29:08.714
...a thousand difficulties
don't make a doubt.

29:08.959 --> 29:13.908
-But l'm not a good Catholic.
-You don't know that. Only God knows.

29:17.159 --> 29:18.558
Gentlemen.

29:19.239 --> 29:20.467
Please.

29:20.799 --> 29:23.996
This is a house of God.
We have no soldiers here.

29:24.159 --> 29:26.229
There are only sick people here.

29:27.839 --> 29:29.113
Please, sir.

29:29.919 --> 29:32.274
-Gentlemen, please.
-No! No!

29:32.479 --> 29:34.151
No! Please! Please!

29:34.359 --> 29:36.350
-No!
-No!

29:36.599 --> 29:40.592
Commander, please.
This is a house of God.

29:40.919 --> 29:44.993
We have no soldiers here. We have
hope. We have only sick people here.

29:45.160 --> 29:47.071
We have only sick people here.

29:47.240 --> 29:48.468
Please.

29:52.440 --> 29:53.429
No, commander.

29:53.600 --> 29:56.239
And blessed is the fruit of thy womb,
Jesus.

29:56.400 --> 29:58.197
Holy Mary, mother of God...

29:58.440 --> 30:01.989
...pray for us sinners
now at the hour of our death.

30:02.160 --> 30:03.275
Commander, no!

30:03.440 --> 30:05.237
-Blessed....
-No!

30:06.000 --> 30:08.560
Holy Mary, mother of God....

30:21.520 --> 30:23.397
What the fuck was that?

30:25.440 --> 30:26.509
Hyena.

30:29.840 --> 30:32.400
Flea, Lake, status?

30:33.000 --> 30:34.399
Clear.

30:37.240 --> 30:38.229
Clear, L.T.

30:39.080 --> 30:40.559
Zee?

30:41.600 --> 30:44.478
Star One, this is Eagle One.
Be advised on location.

30:45.040 --> 30:49.079
This is Star One. My ETA,
your location, five minutes.

30:49.240 --> 30:50.798
Popping smoke.

31:12.601 --> 31:14.159
Do you have smoke?

31:18.001 --> 31:19.195
Roger. Yellow smok e.

31:19.681 --> 31:20.955
That's us.

31:31.201 --> 31:32.190
Eyes on.

32:03.801 --> 32:04.790
Slo, bring her up.

32:04.961 --> 32:07.953
-Let's go! Come on! Now!
-Let's go, ma'am. Come on.

32:08.121 --> 32:10.874
Let's go now! Come on! You're first!
Let's go!

32:11.161 --> 32:12.594
Goddamn it, let's go! We're late.

32:16.761 --> 32:17.750
Come on!

32:25.442 --> 32:27.910
Why doesn't the other helicopter
come down?!

32:28.082 --> 32:30.471
lt's a gunship!
lt's here to protect us!

32:30.682 --> 32:34.152
-What about the others?
-They'll be fine! Keep moving! Hurry up!

32:34.402 --> 32:35.721
You gotta move faster!

32:35.882 --> 32:37.713
-What are you doing?!
-Keep your head down!

32:37.882 --> 32:38.871
Stand back.

32:39.042 --> 32:40.634
-Where is she going?
-Wait! Back!

32:41.522 --> 32:43.717
Keep your head down!

32:44.402 --> 32:45.960
-Let us go!
-Dr. Lena!

32:46.162 --> 32:48.392
-Wait! Get back!
-Dr. Lena!

32:48.602 --> 32:52.390
Answer me! You never planned
on taking all of us out, did you?

32:52.562 --> 32:56.714
l simply follow orders! My orders are
to get you out! Get on the helicopter!

32:56.882 --> 32:59.316
-What about my people?!
-l'm not here for them.

32:59.482 --> 33:00.551
You lied to me!

33:01.122 --> 33:02.441
You lied to me!

33:02.642 --> 33:05.395
Liar! Bastard!

33:06.402 --> 33:08.791
Lena! Let me go!

33:08.962 --> 33:11.601
What about my people?!
l won't leave them!

33:12.322 --> 33:13.516
You lied to me!

33:14.522 --> 33:16.513
-They're gonna die!
-Secure the doctor.

33:16.722 --> 33:19.282
Dr. Lena! Dr. Lena!

33:21.682 --> 33:23.354
Who decides for me?! You?!

33:24.002 --> 33:25.594
Your government?!

33:25.922 --> 33:28.720
Bastard! l won't leave them!

33:28.882 --> 33:31.191
Let's go! Let's go now!
Let's go!

33:38.723 --> 33:40.236
Let's go! Go! Let's go!

33:40.443 --> 33:43.480
Lena! Lena!

33:43.643 --> 33:44.632
Listen to me!

33:48.443 --> 33:50.911
Listen to me! lt's okay.

33:57.763 --> 33:59.196
Let's go!

35:20.684 --> 35:23.073
Lt. Waters. Starboard side.

35:23.844 --> 35:25.402
We saw this on the way in.

35:37.164 --> 35:38.392
No!

35:38.604 --> 35:40.196
No!

35:41.444 --> 35:43.036
No!

35:55.124 --> 35:57.080
-Doc!
-No!

35:57.244 --> 35:58.233
Come on.

37:03.685 --> 37:05.915
Let's turn it around.

37:58.686 --> 37:59.880
Musa.

38:00.726 --> 38:01.761
Patience!

38:08.806 --> 38:10.603
Lena!

38:23.926 --> 38:25.917
We can only take 1 2 people.

38:26.086 --> 38:28.156
Old, young, anybody
who'll slow us down.

38:28.726 --> 38:30.876
We'll meet up again in Cameroon.

38:34.286 --> 38:36.436
Go. And tell the others.

38:38.646 --> 38:41.444
-God will bless you.
-Hurry, please.

38:51.606 --> 38:52.959
Thank you.

39:11.607 --> 39:13.120
Hurry, please.

39:18.167 --> 39:19.282
Red!

39:19.527 --> 39:20.960
Go with the package.

39:21.607 --> 39:22.676
Now, goddamn it!

39:30.487 --> 39:32.318
What are you doing?

39:36.087 --> 39:37.725
New mission?

39:38.487 --> 39:39.681
No.

39:40.007 --> 39:41.076
Same mission.

39:42.567 --> 39:44.159
Get them ready, Zee.

39:53.847 --> 39:57.362
God will protect you.
Take Mama's cross. Take Mama's cross.

39:57.527 --> 39:59.119
Let's go! Get her ready.

39:59.287 --> 40:01.926
We gotta go. We gotta go.

40:02.087 --> 40:04.237
Let's go! Let's go. Come on!

40:06.247 --> 40:07.965
Get her out of there!
Get off!

40:08.127 --> 40:10.482
-Patience! She'll be safe.
-She's my baby!

40:10.647 --> 40:11.636
Keep your head down.

40:15.208 --> 40:17.199
She has no one to care for her.

40:21.688 --> 40:23.838
Ma'am, you gotta take this baby!

40:24.088 --> 40:25.203
Hold her tight!

40:25.368 --> 40:28.280
-Keep your heads down!
-No more packs, sir. We're maxed out.

40:28.488 --> 40:30.080
See you in Cameroon.

40:30.328 --> 40:31.886
Come on. Let's go.

40:32.288 --> 40:33.721
Here we go. Stay low.

40:34.648 --> 40:36.001
Head down.

40:37.928 --> 40:39.077
Let's go.

40:39.248 --> 40:40.840
Sergeant! Let's go!

41:18.808 --> 41:20.639
Eagle One, over.

41:22.648 --> 41:24.286
Can you wait one, sir?

41:25.848 --> 41:27.122
A.K.

41:27.448 --> 41:28.597
Command.

41:28.928 --> 41:29.917
Yes, sir?

41:30.088 --> 41:34.321
Lieutenant, why is that bird full of
refugees and not your criticals?

41:34.489 --> 41:36.320
The doctor wouldn't leave her people.

41:36.889 --> 41:38.402
You can't get a woman on a helo?

41:38.569 --> 41:39.684
She was on the bird.

41:40.409 --> 41:42.843
-It's difficult to explain, sir.
-Oh, come on.

41:43.009 --> 41:46.524
We're marching them to LZ Bravo.
Request helicopters to take them out.

41:46.689 --> 41:48.327
Negative on the evac at LZ Bravo.

41:48.489 --> 41:51.606
Come on, give me three choppers. l'll
have them in Cameroon in 20 minutes.

41:51.769 --> 41:52.918
Negative!

41:53.089 --> 41:55.683
Birds have taken heavy fire. We've
stopped entering Nigerian airspace.

41:55.849 --> 41:58.727
We'll give you what help we can
from our end, but right now...

41:58.889 --> 42:00.117
...you are on your own.

42:03.009 --> 42:04.761
Man, l hope you know
what you're doing.

42:05.809 --> 42:06.924
Me too, sir.

42:07.129 --> 42:09.962
All right. We'll keep you advised
if the situation changes.

42:12.169 --> 42:14.080
Negative on the evac.

42:17.049 --> 42:19.324
Come on. There you go. Come on.

42:20.449 --> 42:22.246
Hang on to the knot, doctor.

42:22.729 --> 42:23.764
-Come on.
-We got you.

42:23.929 --> 42:25.726
Come on. Come on, doc.

42:57.850 --> 42:59.363
Americans.

43:01.050 --> 43:03.166
Some went in the helicopter.

43:05.130 --> 43:07.200
Some went up the mountain...

43:07.930 --> 43:09.124
...to Cameroon.

44:13.491 --> 44:14.606
Slo.

44:22.011 --> 44:23.524
Give me your chow, man.

44:27.531 --> 44:29.567
l don't like roast beef anyway.

44:40.051 --> 44:43.009
We're a little over 30 klicks
to the path to Cameroon.

44:43.171 --> 44:44.286
Roger that.

44:54.251 --> 44:55.320
What do you got?

44:56.131 --> 45:00.443
We got a large body 1 0 klicks back,
bearing 3-6-0 and closing.

45:00.771 --> 45:01.920
How strong?

45:02.091 --> 45:04.924
Thirty, maybe platoon strength,
maybe more.

45:05.451 --> 45:06.600
Rebels?

45:07.651 --> 45:08.845
Could be.

45:09.451 --> 45:11.681
Why would anybody be following us?

45:12.691 --> 45:13.885
l don't know.

45:16.011 --> 45:17.603
But we're gonna find out.

45:18.691 --> 45:19.806
Good job.

45:20.051 --> 45:22.121
-Keep an eye on them.
-Roger that.

45:23.731 --> 45:25.323
-Sir?
-We got a problem.

45:25.491 --> 45:27.880
We got possible hostiles on our 6.

45:28.051 --> 45:29.803
Get them up, get them ready to move.

45:29.971 --> 45:31.371
Roger that.

45:34.172 --> 45:37.130
Dr. Kendricks, could you come with me,
please?

45:37.292 --> 45:39.647
Thank you. lt'll just take a second.

45:43.972 --> 45:47.442
-Do you know why anybody'd follow us?
-No, l don't.

45:47.652 --> 45:48.846
You sure?

45:50.332 --> 45:51.560
Yes, l'm sure.

46:00.572 --> 46:03.848
-Think hard.
-l told you, l don't know.

46:05.532 --> 46:06.885
Get your people ready to go now.

46:07.172 --> 46:09.925
These people have been going
for over 30 hours.

46:10.532 --> 46:11.851
Come on.

46:13.612 --> 46:16.172
Red, help the doctor get ready to move.

47:19.973 --> 47:21.565
How you doing?

47:22.893 --> 47:24.804
The fuck you mean, how am l doing?

47:24.973 --> 47:26.725
You know what l'm talking about.

47:37.013 --> 47:38.571
You know as well as l do...

47:38.733 --> 47:41.566
...that when we left that mission,
those people were dead.

47:42.893 --> 47:46.408
And then we take 28 men, women
and children...

47:46.973 --> 47:48.804
...and we hump for a day.

47:49.013 --> 47:51.243
Zee, keep them moving.

47:51.493 --> 47:53.484
Be with you in a second.

47:54.413 --> 47:58.326
We get them to the LZ, and we leave
them behind to die like the others.

47:59.013 --> 48:00.492
l'm confused.

48:00.653 --> 48:02.371
And the boys are confused.

48:02.573 --> 48:03.972
Get to the point.

48:04.533 --> 48:07.172
Why'd you turn that bird around, L.T.?

48:08.654 --> 48:10.007
Talk to me.

48:10.934 --> 48:13.812
l'm with you either way.
You know that.

48:16.374 --> 48:18.569
When l figure it out, l'll let you know.

48:31.214 --> 48:32.806
This way.

49:16.694 --> 49:18.685
-L.T.
-Go, Lake.

49:18.934 --> 49:21.732
You're gonna want to come
tak e a look at this.

49:27.375 --> 49:30.173
Get Dr. Kendricks up here. Come here.

49:31.015 --> 49:34.690
We'll rest here for a minute. Stay down
in these trees. Listen to my men. Go!

49:34.855 --> 49:35.844
Slo.

49:36.655 --> 49:37.929
Stay down. Stay down.

49:38.095 --> 49:40.245
Zee, Flea, with me.

49:44.775 --> 49:46.447
What do you got?

49:46.615 --> 49:49.607
Ringside seats to an ethnic cleansing.

50:02.295 --> 50:03.523
How strong?

50:03.735 --> 50:05.487
l counted seven so far, sir.

50:05.735 --> 50:07.612
-Flea, get eyes on.
-Roger that.

50:12.655 --> 50:15.215
There could be more in the hooches.

50:16.015 --> 50:17.334
Bring them up.

50:26.535 --> 50:29.254
Sir, we could go around them
to the north.

50:40.855 --> 50:42.288
L.T.

50:43.095 --> 50:45.086
Rules of engagement.

50:45.255 --> 50:47.167
We're already engaged.

50:51.256 --> 50:53.212
Hand me the binoculars.

50:58.296 --> 50:59.524
Flea, you got the Zippo?

51:00.816 --> 51:01.805
Roger that.

51:02.456 --> 51:04.014
Zippo first.

51:04.376 --> 51:08.688
Red Team, right flank. This way.
Edge of clearing. Wait for my go.

51:09.016 --> 51:11.769
Silent and quick.
Gold Team, on me.

51:14.936 --> 51:17.530
Silk, close up that back door.

51:17.936 --> 51:20.928
-Flea, keep your eye on the package.
-Roger that.

51:21.096 --> 51:22.529
Holding.

51:22.896 --> 51:24.011
Let's go.

51:32.136 --> 51:33.125
On-site.

52:25.017 --> 52:26.928
Goddamn.

52:31.457 --> 52:32.970
Been going at it all day.

52:48.737 --> 52:50.489
-On-site.
-Roger that.

53:24.658 --> 53:25.647
Go!

54:51.219 --> 54:53.335
lt's okay. l'm here to help you.

54:56.059 --> 54:57.617
l'll help you. lt's okay.

54:58.619 --> 54:59.768
Atkins!

55:06.299 --> 55:07.368
Hide!

56:23.580 --> 56:25.138
Go! Run! Get out of here!

56:25.300 --> 56:26.938
-Doc, get them out of here!
-Move!

56:27.820 --> 56:28.809
Go! Go!

56:56.380 --> 56:58.735
Hold on. You hold on.

57:03.740 --> 57:05.458
Come on, little man, come on.

57:25.421 --> 57:28.219
Boss, you want me to take a look
at that?

57:29.981 --> 57:31.619
l'm all right.

58:06.901 --> 58:10.291
lt's a kid. lt's only a fucking kid.

58:22.941 --> 58:25.853
Motherfucker. Get the fuck up.

58:30.461 --> 58:32.258
Look at your work, motherfucker.

58:49.902 --> 58:51.255
Lake.

59:19.102 --> 59:21.662
Doc, get over here.

59:36.702 --> 59:38.021
Red.

59:51.942 --> 59:53.933
Her baby's dead.

01:00:06.743 --> 01:00:08.335
Zee.

01:00:27.303 --> 01:00:30.818
Eternal rest grant unto her, oh, Lord.
Let perpetual light shine on her.

01:00:31.063 --> 01:00:34.180
May her soul and the souls
of all the dead rest in peace.

01:00:36.183 --> 01:00:37.983
Eternal rest grant unto her, oh, Lord.
Let perpetual light shine on her.

01:00:37.983 --> 01:00:39.496
Eternal rest grant unto her, oh, Lord.
Let perpetual light shine on her.

01:00:39.703 --> 01:00:42.581
May her soul and the souls
of all the dead rest in peace.

01:00:52.423 --> 01:00:54.015
She has a low pulse.

01:01:03.663 --> 01:01:05.733
How can they do this?

01:01:06.903 --> 01:01:08.894
This is what they do.

01:01:10.263 --> 01:01:13.221
They cut off the breasts
of nursing mothers...

01:01:13.463 --> 01:01:16.978
...so that they'll never again
feed their own babies.

01:01:19.544 --> 01:01:21.694
This is what they do.

01:01:27.424 --> 01:01:28.652
Doc.

01:01:30.264 --> 01:01:32.016
l need morphine.

01:03:51.385 --> 01:03:52.659
Dr. Kendricks.

01:03:55.625 --> 01:03:57.218
Dr. Kendricks.

01:04:01.866 --> 01:04:02.935
lt's all right.

01:05:06.106 --> 01:05:09.416
-ls something wrong?
-Let me take care of your arm.

01:05:12.026 --> 01:05:13.175
All right.

01:05:28.347 --> 01:05:29.462
Careful.

01:05:33.667 --> 01:05:35.180
Try this.

01:05:35.387 --> 01:05:37.457
lt will help you stay awake.

01:05:39.347 --> 01:05:40.939
What is it?

01:05:41.107 --> 01:05:42.620
Cola nut from the tree.

01:05:47.027 --> 01:05:48.426
lt's harmless.

01:05:48.587 --> 01:05:50.464
We've been using them
for generations.

01:05:51.347 --> 01:05:53.497
Patience, right?

01:05:56.027 --> 01:05:57.619
How long you been at the mission?

01:05:58.747 --> 01:06:00.100
l live there.

01:06:00.267 --> 01:06:02.940
l've been living there since l was 1 0.

01:06:04.187 --> 01:06:05.256
How come?

01:06:06.027 --> 01:06:09.940
l heard they were helping children
who had been forced into the war...

01:06:10.587 --> 01:06:12.100
...so l ran to them.

01:06:18.027 --> 01:06:20.336
Will you get me to my daughter?

01:06:27.627 --> 01:06:28.980
Yes, ma'am.

01:06:38.268 --> 01:06:41.066
How'd you end up here in Africa?

01:06:41.388 --> 01:06:43.663
l came here with my husband.

01:06:45.308 --> 01:06:47.344
We wanted to help.

01:06:48.508 --> 01:06:52.547
We went to Sierra Leone.
They were short of doctors there.

01:06:53.148 --> 01:06:54.297
Cut.

01:07:02.308 --> 01:07:04.583
How did your husband die?

01:07:11.588 --> 01:07:14.148
We were at the hospital.

01:07:15.588 --> 01:07:17.385
The rebels came.

01:07:18.348 --> 01:07:22.705
My husband tried to stop them,
to protect me...

01:07:24.108 --> 01:07:25.780
...but he couldn't.

01:07:28.028 --> 01:07:29.507
l'm sorry.

01:07:38.228 --> 01:07:40.344
You did a good thing today.

01:07:48.588 --> 01:07:51.022
l don't know if it was a good thing
or not.

01:07:56.469 --> 01:07:59.063
Feels like so long since l've done...

01:08:00.349 --> 01:08:02.704
...a good thing, the right thing.

01:08:05.629 --> 01:08:07.859
You should have some rest.

01:08:10.029 --> 01:08:12.862
Thank you for taking care of my arm.

01:08:50.229 --> 01:08:51.707
Easy, boss.

01:09:03.149 --> 01:09:06.380
-Are we there yet?
-Glad to see you still got it...

01:09:06.749 --> 01:09:08.182
...but we got trouble.

01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:14.743
You all right?

01:09:17.470 --> 01:09:18.459
What do you got?

01:09:18.670 --> 01:09:21.309
This is the outfit
that's been on our tail.

01:09:21.790 --> 01:09:24.542
-Hey. You with me, boss?
-Yeah.

01:09:25.670 --> 01:09:28.264
-This is at 2200 hours.
-Yeah.

01:09:28.830 --> 01:09:30.582
Four hours ago.

01:09:30.830 --> 01:09:32.229
Three hours.

01:09:32.470 --> 01:09:35.859
We figured they'd make camp
and come at us after first light, right?

01:09:36.029 --> 01:09:37.383
Bad call.

01:09:37.630 --> 01:09:39.301
Two hours ago.

01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:40.499
One.

01:09:40.710 --> 01:09:45.305
These guys run the damned Olympics.
They've been closing in on us all night.

01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:47.702
How long we got?

01:09:48.670 --> 01:09:50.899
An hour, two tops.

01:09:51.390 --> 01:09:52.743
We shouldn't have stopped.

01:09:53.630 --> 01:09:55.939
How the fuck are they tracking us
at night?

01:10:02.710 --> 01:10:04.428
Someone's transmitting something.

01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:12.343
Zee.

01:10:13.990 --> 01:10:16.379
We got a rat in the nest.
Get them up.

01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:19.542
Take their weapons away.
We search everybody right now.

01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:21.509
-Okay, team.
-Dr. Kendricks.

01:10:21.670 --> 01:10:23.262
-Turn two.
-Lena. Get up.

01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:24.658
Everybody, up.

01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:28.027
Point out everybody that came into
the mission in the last three days.

01:10:28.190 --> 01:10:29.623
-Right now.
-Let's see the weapons.

01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:33.782
Give me your weapons.

01:10:38.031 --> 01:10:40.909
-Gideon.
-Let's go. Step forward, sir.

01:10:41.071 --> 01:10:42.470
Who else?

01:10:44.751 --> 01:10:46.150
Who else?!

01:10:46.431 --> 01:10:47.546
These people.

01:10:47.751 --> 01:10:50.743
-Step forward, you two, right now.
-On your knees.

01:10:50.911 --> 01:10:52.390
L.T.!

01:10:55.231 --> 01:10:56.505
Down! Now!

01:10:57.191 --> 01:10:58.340
Silk.

01:10:59.631 --> 01:11:01.303
No!

01:11:04.391 --> 01:11:07.303
-Hey! What the hell are you doing?
-He's my friend!

01:11:07.471 --> 01:11:09.302
You know what?
He could also be armed.

01:11:09.471 --> 01:11:11.985
Get back there with the others!
Go on!

01:11:17.071 --> 01:11:19.505
-Watch his hands.
-Fuck.

01:11:21.191 --> 01:11:22.419
Shit.

01:11:23.951 --> 01:11:25.942
What the hell is that?

01:11:26.671 --> 01:11:28.309
What do you got?

01:11:28.831 --> 01:11:30.025
He's bugged.

01:11:30.191 --> 01:11:31.624
You fuck!

01:11:37.191 --> 01:11:38.909
-Stop it!
-Who told you to do this?

01:11:39.071 --> 01:11:41.301
-They have my family.
-Who told you to do it?!

01:11:41.471 --> 01:11:43.860
-They have my family.
-Who has your family?!

01:11:44.031 --> 01:11:46.750
l was promised no harm
will come to them.

01:11:47.871 --> 01:11:49.827
-Who told you to do it?!
-Stop it!

01:11:50.471 --> 01:11:53.464
-Who told you to do it?!
-Col. Sadick.

01:11:54.192 --> 01:11:55.227
Col. Sadick.

01:11:56.672 --> 01:11:59.232
l am one of many
who give him information.

01:12:00.672 --> 01:12:02.663
About who?
lnformation about who?!

01:12:02.832 --> 01:12:04.663
We have to follow....

01:12:05.992 --> 01:12:07.710
Who?! Who?!

01:12:07.872 --> 01:12:10.102
We have to follow....

01:12:10.592 --> 01:12:12.742
-Follow who?!
-Arthur.

01:12:12.912 --> 01:12:14.345
Arthur?

01:12:22.032 --> 01:12:23.784
l am not a killer.

01:12:26.992 --> 01:12:28.664
The fuck you're not.

01:12:33.792 --> 01:12:36.670
-What do you wanna do with him?
-Let him bleed out.

01:12:41.232 --> 01:12:42.426
Why?

01:12:44.832 --> 01:12:49.542
What is going to happen
to my family?

01:12:51.552 --> 01:12:52.826
l don't know.

01:12:53.472 --> 01:12:56.111
-Help them.
-Zee. Lake.

01:12:56.512 --> 01:12:58.742
-Get them up.
-Everybody up. Now.

01:13:07.792 --> 01:13:09.908
Who knows what this is?

01:13:15.633 --> 01:13:17.305
This is a transmitter.

01:13:19.393 --> 01:13:22.430
l took this off Gideon's dead body...

01:13:23.233 --> 01:13:24.825
...Dr. Kendricks' good friend.

01:13:28.513 --> 01:13:30.390
You have any more of these here?

01:13:32.833 --> 01:13:35.472
Why would anybody wanna transmit
our position?

01:13:35.633 --> 01:13:40.024
Transmit our position
to over 300 Nigerian soldiers...

01:13:40.593 --> 01:13:41.867
...who ran all night...

01:13:42.753 --> 01:13:45.631
...to get to within an hour and a half
of where we are now?

01:13:51.033 --> 01:13:52.022
Red.

01:13:56.833 --> 01:13:59.188
Somebody's gonna tell me.

01:13:59.353 --> 01:14:01.867
Somebody's gonna start talking
right now.

01:14:02.993 --> 01:14:06.269
Because if they don't tell me
what l want to know...

01:14:06.433 --> 01:14:08.583
...by the time l count to five...

01:14:08.753 --> 01:14:10.903
...l'm gonna kill someone else.

01:14:11.793 --> 01:14:13.226
One.

01:14:15.313 --> 01:14:16.905
Two.

01:14:18.993 --> 01:14:20.790
Three.

01:14:22.473 --> 01:14:23.986
Don't fuck with me.

01:14:24.433 --> 01:14:26.503
-Four.
-Please.

01:14:27.233 --> 01:14:28.586
Please.

01:14:28.833 --> 01:14:30.267
There's no need for this.

01:14:32.594 --> 01:14:34.107
Please.

01:14:34.274 --> 01:14:36.834
Now you got something
to say to me, don't you?

01:14:37.314 --> 01:14:39.384
My name is Arthur Azuka.

01:14:42.114 --> 01:14:45.550
l'm the only son
of President Samuel Azuka.

01:14:49.034 --> 01:14:50.831
Please don't blame them.

01:14:51.794 --> 01:14:52.829
Please.

01:14:54.354 --> 01:14:56.185
l'm sorry to have misled you...

01:14:56.354 --> 01:14:58.993
...but there are enemies
looking for me everywhere.

01:14:59.234 --> 01:15:01.828
That is why you're being pursued.

01:15:04.834 --> 01:15:07.712
Our report said the entire
presidential family was executed.

01:15:08.074 --> 01:15:10.668
Your reports were incorrect.

01:15:11.634 --> 01:15:13.625
They were not executed.

01:15:14.114 --> 01:15:16.184
They murdered my father...

01:15:16.754 --> 01:15:18.745
...along with my mother...

01:15:19.634 --> 01:15:21.067
...and my two...

01:15:22.514 --> 01:15:23.947
...younger sisters...

01:15:25.554 --> 01:15:27.545
...out of greed...

01:15:28.274 --> 01:15:31.664
...and my father's fight for democracy
for his people.

01:15:35.074 --> 01:15:36.587
My people.

01:15:38.114 --> 01:15:40.582
When it first appeared
there might be trouble...

01:15:40.754 --> 01:15:43.222
...my father sent me away with this man.

01:15:44.594 --> 01:15:46.107
Col. Okeze.

01:15:47.954 --> 01:15:51.470
Lieutenant, his father was more
than the president.

01:15:51.635 --> 01:15:53.227
He was the tribal king.

01:15:53.395 --> 01:15:55.511
That makes him the heir
to the lbo nation.

01:15:56.115 --> 01:15:57.992
lt's a bloodline they must cut.

01:15:58.435 --> 01:16:01.950
The Fulanis will comb heaven
and earth to find him.

01:16:09.795 --> 01:16:11.228
You knew about this?

01:16:13.075 --> 01:16:15.543
You knew all the time,
and you didn't tell me.

01:16:18.435 --> 01:16:20.187
l didn't trust you...

01:16:20.435 --> 01:16:22.073
...at the time.

01:16:29.915 --> 01:16:31.985
l wonder what it takes
to earn your trust.

01:16:34.995 --> 01:16:36.553
Red, Lake.

01:16:41.675 --> 01:16:44.314
Tell them to pack their things.
We're leaving.

01:16:45.795 --> 01:16:48.628
Men, give them their weapons.
We're moving out of here.

01:16:48.795 --> 01:16:50.274
-Pack up your things.
-Come on.

01:16:50.435 --> 01:16:51.584
Move it out!

01:16:52.355 --> 01:16:54.471
-Get in, get out. Okay?
-Come on.

01:16:54.915 --> 01:16:56.667
Move it. Move it.

01:16:57.115 --> 01:16:59.913
-Come on. See you. Hurry back.
-Back in formation.

01:17:28.716 --> 01:17:32.504
They must continue their route to
the Tandjile Pass or they'll lose a day.

01:17:32.676 --> 01:17:36.828
So they must come out here,
near the Cameroon border.

01:17:40.036 --> 01:17:41.151
No!

01:18:10.276 --> 01:18:12.073
How many men
do you have in Gashanka?

01:18:19.236 --> 01:18:20.669
Right on time.

01:18:20.956 --> 01:18:23.516
Good hustle, Red.
Come on up and brief Zee.

01:18:26.436 --> 01:18:28.792
This river will get us
straight into Cameroon.

01:18:29.157 --> 01:18:30.795
They'll be expecting us.

01:18:32.317 --> 01:18:33.955
What do you think?

01:18:34.117 --> 01:18:36.312
l think we're fucked
either way we go.

01:18:37.757 --> 01:18:40.715
We backtrack, cross downstream...

01:18:40.877 --> 01:18:44.187
...come up, go through the jungle
and rip right into Cameroon.

01:18:45.597 --> 01:18:47.986
Roger that. Let the other men know.

01:18:48.157 --> 01:18:49.909
-Yes, sir.
-Good job.

01:18:50.757 --> 01:18:52.031
L.T.

01:18:52.637 --> 01:18:55.197
-What do you got?
-Rhodes on the phone.

01:18:58.717 --> 01:19:00.150
Yes, sir, captain, this is Waters.

01:19:00.317 --> 01:19:02.592
lntel reports military elements
in your sector...

01:19:02.757 --> 01:19:05.669
...conducting search and destroy
of a U.S. military unit...

01:19:06.117 --> 01:19:09.792
...moving with Arthur Azuka, son of the
late president. What can you tell me?

01:19:09.957 --> 01:19:12.187
Yes, sir, we just discovered that
ourselves.

01:19:12.357 --> 01:19:15.554
He and his bodyguard hid themselves
within Dr. Kendricks' refugee party.

01:19:16.957 --> 01:19:18.709
That's a major problem, lieutenant.

01:19:18.877 --> 01:19:22.552
He inv olves your mission in the
internal politics of a foreign nation...

01:19:22.717 --> 01:19:26.551
...affecting U.S. diplomacy and
seriously increases the mission's risk.

01:19:26.757 --> 01:19:29.271
He's considered a criminal
by the new regime.

01:19:29.477 --> 01:19:31.035
He's a major liability.

01:19:31.197 --> 01:19:34.553
-What exactly does that mean, sir?
-His party is excess cargo.

01:19:34.917 --> 01:19:36.509
You mean he's not human, sir?

01:19:37.157 --> 01:19:40.593
Captain, this man is the lbo tribal
leader. Do you know what that means?

01:19:40.757 --> 01:19:42.793
Cut the shit. Who do you think l am?

01:19:44.837 --> 01:19:47.955
Sir, we both know what'll happen to him
if l leave him out here.

01:19:48.158 --> 01:19:50.308
There won't be a trial or a jury.

01:19:50.478 --> 01:19:52.833
Outside the courthouse,
they'll put two in his head.

01:19:53.198 --> 01:19:56.588
l'm just asking for a little help here.
Put yourself in my shoes, Bill.

01:19:56.758 --> 01:19:58.350
l've been in your shoes, lieutenant.

01:19:58.518 --> 01:20:01.476
Send in an air evac immediately
and get all of us out of here, sir.

01:20:01.638 --> 01:20:04.948
Negative on air support at this time.
Airspace is too hot.

01:20:05.118 --> 01:20:09.350
Your judgment has risk ed the lives of
your men and the mission's success.

01:20:09.518 --> 01:20:12.669
l advise you, complete the evacuation
as planned! Do you read me?!

01:20:14.118 --> 01:20:16.188
Yes, sir, l read you. Loud and clear.

01:20:16.998 --> 01:20:20.513
But l cannot, in good conscience, do that
without taking these people to safety.

01:20:20.678 --> 01:20:21.713
That's not your mission!

01:20:21.878 --> 01:20:24.028
When have l not completed a mission?

01:20:25.438 --> 01:20:27.508
My team will complete this mission.

01:20:27.798 --> 01:20:29.197
l give you my word on that.

01:20:29.358 --> 01:20:30.996
l don't like this.

01:20:31.638 --> 01:20:33.788
Get your ass back here alive
soon as possible.

01:20:33.958 --> 01:20:35.949
Maintain contact with OP center.

01:20:38.198 --> 01:20:40.348
l'll direct air support
as soon as l can.

01:20:40.678 --> 01:20:41.952
I promise you.

01:20:42.678 --> 01:20:43.793
Yes, sir.

01:20:44.718 --> 01:20:46.037
Eagle One, out.

01:20:48.758 --> 01:20:50.032
Bring them up.

01:20:50.678 --> 01:20:53.238
Everybody up on L.T. now. Double time.

01:20:53.478 --> 01:20:54.957
So much for diplomacy.

01:20:56.038 --> 01:20:57.357
Come on, let's go.

01:21:02.198 --> 01:21:05.953
Here's the deal. lt's been strongly
suggested that we turn over Arthur...

01:21:06.999 --> 01:21:09.638
...and abandon these refugees
out here in the bush.

01:21:11.719 --> 01:21:14.677
l'll tell you right now
l'm not gonna do that.

01:21:15.199 --> 01:21:16.871
l can't do that.

01:21:18.919 --> 01:21:20.637
l broke my own rule.

01:21:21.959 --> 01:21:24.029
l started to give a fuck...

01:21:24.839 --> 01:21:27.399
...and brought you guys along with me.

01:21:28.519 --> 01:21:33.798
We're about to walk into some serious
shit. Before we do, l'd just like...

01:21:36.159 --> 01:21:40.118
...to hear what you guys have to say
about it. That's all. Speak freely.

01:21:41.159 --> 01:21:43.229
ln my opinion, sir...

01:21:43.399 --> 01:21:46.471
...we cut our losses.
This isn't our fucking war.

01:21:47.839 --> 01:21:49.909
As far as me being in or out...

01:21:50.919 --> 01:21:52.511
...you know the answer to that.

01:21:55.199 --> 01:21:57.269
Let's get these people to safety.

01:21:58.239 --> 01:22:00.036
Let's finish the job.

01:22:02.919 --> 01:22:04.796
l can't leave them, sir.

01:22:07.399 --> 01:22:08.991
l'm good to go.

01:22:10.999 --> 01:22:12.955
What about you, Red?

01:22:17.279 --> 01:22:20.271
l can't look at them
like packages anymore.

01:22:21.999 --> 01:22:24.389
l'm gonna get them out...

01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:27.115
...or l'm going to die trying.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.752
Are we there yet?

01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:41.949
Thanks, fellas.

01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:48.119
Strip those packs down
to rolling gear only.

01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:52.353
Have the refugees drop anything
that don't go '' boom.'' Let's move.

01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:57.114
Double time. Let's go. Hustle.

01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:00.874
L.T...

01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:05.959
...those Africans are my people too.

01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:10.799
For all the years that we were told
to stand down and to stand by...

01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:14.998
...you're doing the right thing.

01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:21.873
For our sins.

01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:23.189
Hooyah.

01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:24.789
Hooyah.

01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:36.309
We gotta go.

01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:37.629
Let's go.

01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:38.915
Lieutenant.

01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:41.996
l'm sorry l didn't tell you
about Arthur.

01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:44.916
l should have trusted you.

01:23:47.641 --> 01:23:49.518
lt's not your fault.

01:23:52.681 --> 01:23:55.673
l would've done the same thing
if l was in your position.

01:23:55.841 --> 01:23:57.638
l wouldn't have trusted me either.

01:23:57.801 --> 01:24:00.190
l'm gonna get your people
to Cameroon.

01:24:01.481 --> 01:24:04.553
l promise.
Come on. We gotta hurry.

01:24:54.521 --> 01:24:57.319
L.T., hold one.

01:24:57.561 --> 01:24:59.711
Hold one.

01:25:23.962 --> 01:25:25.714
What do you got, Lake?

01:25:33.322 --> 01:25:36.473
Everybody down.
Get down! Get down!

01:25:41.762 --> 01:25:44.435
Where you at, motherfuckers?

01:25:44.602 --> 01:25:46.513
Where you at?

01:26:01.682 --> 01:26:03.035
Fat fuck.

01:26:05.922 --> 01:26:07.992
Look at this motherfucker.

01:26:08.202 --> 01:26:09.715
Pussy.

01:26:11.082 --> 01:26:13.312
Clear, L.T. lt's just a pig.

01:26:13.722 --> 01:26:15.235
l'm crossing over.

01:26:19.722 --> 01:26:20.711
Sniper, 1 1 o'clock.

01:26:20.882 --> 01:26:22.396
Sniper, 1 1 o'clock.

01:26:25.763 --> 01:26:28.277
-Zee!
-Smoke! Give me smoke!

01:26:28.443 --> 01:26:29.592
L.T...

01:26:30.243 --> 01:26:31.835
...l got hit. Sniper.

01:26:32.003 --> 01:26:32.992
Go!

01:26:39.883 --> 01:26:43.000
-Look who it is. The fucking cavalry.
-Keep your hand on that.

01:26:43.163 --> 01:26:44.437
-Sit him up.
-How's he doing?

01:26:45.163 --> 01:26:47.279
He's all right. One in the shoulder.
Clean hit.

01:26:47.443 --> 01:26:49.161
Sorry, sir. He caught me sleeping.

01:26:49.323 --> 01:26:50.358
Don't worry about it.

01:26:50.563 --> 01:26:53.555
-Did you get that little son of a bitch?
-We got some of him.

01:26:53.803 --> 01:26:55.282
-You see anybody else?
-Sorry.

01:26:55.443 --> 01:26:56.796
-l'm better than that, sir.
-Don't worry.

01:26:56.963 --> 01:26:58.112
l'm better than that.

01:26:58.283 --> 01:26:59.432
-Fuck that.
-Can you walk?

01:26:59.683 --> 01:27:00.672
Yes, sir.

01:27:01.883 --> 01:27:04.761
Let's go, Doc. Make it tight.
Get me back in this shit.

01:27:05.443 --> 01:27:06.876
All right. Ready.

01:27:10.603 --> 01:27:12.116
Get down!

01:27:57.764 --> 01:27:58.958
Grenade!

01:28:36.804 --> 01:28:38.203
Dr. Kendricks!

01:28:38.684 --> 01:28:40.322
Lena!

01:28:40.924 --> 01:28:42.323
Lena!

01:28:50.004 --> 01:28:51.642
Lena, listen. Wake up.

01:28:51.844 --> 01:28:54.836
Wake up. Oh, God. Wake up.
Wake up. Do you hear me?

01:28:55.044 --> 01:28:56.238
Okeze! Okeze!

01:28:56.404 --> 01:28:57.519
Wake up.

01:28:57.724 --> 01:28:59.123
Okeze.

01:29:00.045 --> 01:29:01.558
Lena, listen to me.

01:29:01.765 --> 01:29:03.995
We've gotta get out of here now!
You hear me?

01:29:04.525 --> 01:29:08.120
Listen, we gotta get out of here.
We gotta get out of here right now.

01:29:08.285 --> 01:29:10.196
Slo, Zee, get them ready to go now!

01:29:10.805 --> 01:29:11.794
Sit up.

01:29:11.965 --> 01:29:12.954
Slo!

01:29:14.525 --> 01:29:15.878
Slo!

01:29:17.965 --> 01:29:20.923
-Oh, fuck! Goddamn it!
-Fuck.

01:29:21.565 --> 01:29:23.715
l never saw it coming, boss.

01:29:23.925 --> 01:29:25.119
Son of a bitch.

01:29:27.765 --> 01:29:30.120
lt wasn't supposed to happen
like this.

01:29:30.285 --> 01:29:32.640
lt's my fault.
lt's my fault, all right?

01:29:32.805 --> 01:29:33.999
Breathe.

01:29:35.445 --> 01:29:37.083
-You know what to do, right?
-Yeah.

01:29:37.285 --> 01:29:38.559
Yeah, l know what to do.

01:29:38.805 --> 01:29:41.558
You hear me? l got it, okay?

01:29:41.725 --> 01:29:43.681
Breathe. Just relax.

01:29:45.925 --> 01:29:47.358
Breathe.

01:29:47.805 --> 01:29:48.794
No!

01:29:51.205 --> 01:29:52.194
No.

01:29:54.405 --> 01:29:57.522
You'll get them there, right?
lt's not for nothing, right? Right?

01:29:57.685 --> 01:29:59.721
l'll get them there. Don't worry.
l got it.

01:29:59.885 --> 01:30:02.353
l got everything, all right?
Don't worry.

01:30:03.925 --> 01:30:06.200
Breathe, Slo. Breathe, breathe.

01:30:07.445 --> 01:30:09.640
l guess we're there, huh, boss?

01:30:10.645 --> 01:30:12.476
Yeah, we're there.

01:30:33.966 --> 01:30:36.526
Zee, get these people ready to go.
Do it now.

01:30:37.366 --> 01:30:38.765
Silk...

01:30:38.926 --> 01:30:41.565
...get his weapons and ammunition.

01:30:43.286 --> 01:30:44.878
What about the body?

01:30:45.206 --> 01:30:46.844
We gotta come back for it.

01:30:47.246 --> 01:30:48.679
Goddamn it.

01:30:49.046 --> 01:30:50.559
Goddamn it!

01:30:56.246 --> 01:31:00.159
-No.
-Listen to me, goddamn it! Listen to me!

01:31:00.326 --> 01:31:03.079
This man is dead. lf you don't
want his death to be meaningless...

01:31:03.246 --> 01:31:06.397
...it's time for you to become a man
and get your people into Cameroon!

01:31:06.646 --> 01:31:09.479
Now cowboy the fuck up!
You got it?

01:31:12.646 --> 01:31:14.284
Do you understand me?

01:31:14.446 --> 01:31:16.164
-Yes, sir.
-Good.

01:31:16.326 --> 01:31:17.441
-You all right?
-Yes, sir.

01:31:17.646 --> 01:31:19.079
-Stay with this man.
-Yes, sir.

01:31:19.246 --> 01:31:20.166
lt's your job to keep him alive!
Everybody down!

01:31:20.166 --> 01:31:21.758
lt's your job to keep him alive!
Everybody down!

01:31:24.486 --> 01:31:25.839
Get down! Stay down!

01:31:26.806 --> 01:31:29.479
Open up those toolboxes, boys.
They'll be coming!

01:31:29.646 --> 01:31:31.398
Conserve your ammo!

01:31:31.606 --> 01:31:32.641
Get down! Get back.

01:31:32.966 --> 01:31:35.002
