Let's begin.

Oh, I'm seeing a romance.

00:29.530 --> 00:30.822
This is going to be so fun.

Ah. From your past.

- Oh.
- Okay.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.438
Well, they're not getting
a dollar out of me.

I'm buying these.

Well, let's get them and go

- Can't fool this lady.
- Not gonna.

07:34.413 --> 07:36.832
- Can you just try to put yourself
out there, honey?

07:36.832 --> 07:38.208
- Sure.
- Okay.

07:38.208 --> 07:39.960
Who wants charcoal ice cream?

07:39.960 --> 07:42.671

Maggie? What are you doing here?

07:50.429 --> 07:51.847
Is this an intervention?

07:51.847 --> 07:53.473
What? No. Why?

07:53.473 --> 07:55.100
You never come to my yoga class.

07:55.100 --> 07:57.394
Also, I drink while I teach sometimes.

07:57.394 --> 07:58.854
But, you know, like in a fun way.

07:58.854 --> 08:00.439
Ohh. Yeah.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.524
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

08:02.524 --> 08:04.776
I'm just trying to overthink less

08:04.776 --> 08:06.904
and live in the moment more.

08:07.404 --> 08:08.572
Thought yoga might help.

08:08.572 --> 08:10.490
- Since when are you open
to trying new things?

08:10.490 --> 08:13.327
Since I saw myself in a vision.

08:13.327 --> 08:15.204
I was married, with a kid.

08:15.204 --> 08:17.372
- No way!
- Yeah.

08:17.372 --> 08:19.416
- But you have to, like,
talk to people to get married.

08:20.542 --> 08:23.337
- Also, you might like having a kid.
They get you out of going to parties.

08:23.337 --> 08:25.506
- Not kids' parties.
And those are the worst kind.

08:25.506 --> 08:27.549
- That's true.
- So how does this work?

08:27.549 --> 08:29.426
It's like Twister, right?
Except religious.

08:29.426 --> 08:31.637
Okay, you're embarrassing me.

08:31.637 --> 08:33.055

- Oh.

08:34.598 --> 08:36.183
Yeah, actually, just give those to me.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.809

Here you go.

08:39.520 --> 08:40.687
Oh, hi.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.606
Welcome. Love your energy.

08:42.606 --> 08:45.442
You can put your mat just closer to mine.

08:52.157 --> 08:53.867
- Glenn with two N's?
- Yes.

08:53.867 --> 08:54.952

08:55.661 --> 08:57.162
- It's not weird, okay.
- It's weird.

08:57.162 --> 09:01.291
- He just texted me asking to meet him
at Bar Stanley tonight.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.710
- Hey, Glenn!
- I know.

09:03.710 --> 09:06.046
I think this is the night
I open his fridge

09:06.046 --> 09:08.173
and see what kind of meat
he's got in there.

09:08.173 --> 09:09.591
I bet it's kosher.

09:14.513 --> 09:15.889
Oh no. What is that look?

09:15.889 --> 09:17.724
Lou, we have a deal.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.393
I can't tell you who your soulmate is,

09:19.393 --> 09:20.894
and you can't date my hot uncle.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.521
And I get nothing from that deal.

09:22.521 --> 09:24.648
- You get to not spend
the weekend at police auctions

09:24.648 --> 09:26.275
trying to get his jet ski back.

09:26.275 --> 09:28.569
- Can you at least come
to the bar with me tonight

09:28.569 --> 09:30.779
and just tell me
if Glenn is a serial killer

09:30.779 --> 09:32.489
or worse, bad in bed?

09:32.489 --> 09:34.074
His name is Glenn with two N's.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.993
That's proof he doesn't know
when to finish.

09:36.785 --> 09:39.329
Fine. Okay. Okay, I'll come.

09:39.329 --> 09:40.956
Yay!

09:41.582 --> 09:43.792
I'm going to try out my new mascara.

09:47.129 --> 09:51.133
When Glenn said that he wanted to spend
more time exploring Orlando,

09:51.133 --> 09:54.595
I didn't know that he was talking
about his boyfriend.

09:54.887 --> 09:55.804
Yeah.

09:59.641 --> 10:01.351
I just want to go home.

10:02.311 --> 10:04.938
- Oh. Why don't we go to my house
and look up guys from high school

10:04.938 --> 10:07.399
to see if they ended up marrying women
that look like their moms?

10:07.399 --> 10:09.735
I have a good feeling
about Oscar Saltarelli.

10:10.736 --> 10:12.529
Do you have any soft cheeses?

10:12.529 --> 10:16.658
- I have got a 2017 Boursin <i>spreadable--</i>

10:16.658 --> 10:18.535
Speak English and be serious, okay.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.996
I can't take
any more lies tonight, Maggie.

10:20.996 --> 10:22.039
Excuse me, Lou.

10:22.039 --> 10:24.458
What is the first rule of our friendship?

10:25.209 --> 10:28.420
We don't lie about cheese.

10:30.005 --> 10:31.256
I love it when you do that.

10:31.256 --> 10:32.424
Do what?

10:33.300 --> 10:35.093
Know how to make my life better.

10:37.471 --> 10:38.931
How does my makeup look?

10:39.556 --> 10:41.058
You're beautiful.

10:41.058 --> 10:42.851
- Honestly, you should cry more.
- You're the best.

10:42.851 --> 10:44.019
- Sorry.
- Oh. Sorry.

10:45.562 --> 10:46.396
Oh.

10:46.772 --> 10:48.815
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:49.816 --> 10:52.110
- There you are.
But, like, for real this time.

10:52.110 --> 10:53.820
Yes, here we are.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.656
That's not the most
original line I've heard,

10:55.656 --> 10:56.782
but I'll go with it.

10:56.782 --> 10:59.284
- No, I-I actually do know this guy.

10:59.284 --> 11:00.786
Um, do you guys want a drink?

11:00.786 --> 11:02.496
My sister's got a table for my birthday.

11:03.288 --> 11:04.831
- Could you give us a second?
- Yeah.

11:04.831 --> 11:07.000
And thank you for the birthday wishes.
That's very sweet.

11:08.961 --> 11:09.920
That was funny.

11:11.129 --> 11:13.882
- That was the guy
that I saw myself marrying.

11:14.424 --> 11:15.259
Oh.

11:15.759 --> 11:17.594
We should go. I'm not ready for this.

11:17.594 --> 11:20.013
- Look, you said you wanted to live more
in the moment, right?

11:20.514 --> 11:23.183
- Mm.
- Well, this is the moment.

11:24.226 --> 11:25.769
Okay. Okay.

11:26.979 --> 11:30.190
Okay. We're going to stay
on one condition.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.149
Yes.

11:32.860 --> 11:33.819
Tequila shots.

11:34.820 --> 11:37.364
- Hey!
- Happy birthday.

11:38.240 --> 11:39.867
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.662
Happy birthday, buddy.

11:43.662 --> 11:45.122
Oh, thank you.

11:45.122 --> 11:46.456
I'm not going to ruin the surprise,

11:46.456 --> 11:49.293
but this one is Amy's latest cookbook.

11:49.293 --> 11:50.252
Yeah.

11:50.878 --> 11:53.881
Uh, pro tip. You can just add shrooms
to any of those dishes.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.465
- Please don't do that
to any of my recipes.

11:55.465 --> 11:56.592
Oh, Amy's right. Amy's right.

11:56.592 --> 11:58.385
You can just freestyle the shrooms.

11:58.385 --> 11:59.386
Thanks, babe.

11:59.386 --> 12:01.763
Oh my god, your sister's Eggless Amy?

12:01.763 --> 12:03.891
- She's vegan non-infertile
so don't bring it up.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.976
It's a sore subject so--

12:06.977 --> 12:09.354
This is what I want in a relationship.

12:09.354 --> 12:11.732
- You should totally come
to Burning Man with us next year.

12:11.732 --> 12:13.734
- Yes.
- Hey, are you a licensed plumber?

12:13.734 --> 12:15.485
Uh, I could be.

12:15.485 --> 12:16.945
I like your family.

12:17.446 --> 12:18.655
They're such a perfect match,

12:18.655 --> 12:21.074
like peanut butter and very high jelly.

12:21.491 --> 12:24.203
Yeah. Somehow they make it work.

12:24.203 --> 12:26.121
Guess you can't fight fate, huh?

12:26.747 --> 12:27.623
Guess not.

12:29.750 --> 12:32.336
So I'm going to blow this candle out

12:32.336 --> 12:34.963
and make a wish
that I spend more time with you.

12:35.506 --> 12:36.298
Tonight.

12:37.966 --> 12:39.593
That wasn't slick at all.

12:40.177 --> 12:43.514
So is my wish going to come true?

12:44.097 --> 12:45.224
That depends.

12:45.933 --> 12:48.101
Do you know how to use chopsticks?

12:49.561 --> 12:50.979
Your technique is off.

12:50.979 --> 12:52.356
- Is it?
- Hmm.

12:52.898 --> 12:53.941
How?

12:55.317 --> 12:56.527
Alright, so be honest.

12:56.527 --> 12:58.779
Did you know we were going
to do that when we first met?

13:00.239 --> 13:02.533
I, uh, had a hunch.

13:02.533 --> 13:05.118
- Did you know I was going
to get a cramp halfway there?

13:05.118 --> 13:07.829
- No, because I didn't know
that I was hooking up

13:07.829 --> 13:09.915
with someone in my mom's mahjong club.

13:09.915 --> 13:10.582
Hmm.

13:13.502 --> 13:15.671
So what's the deal? I mean.

13:16.672 --> 13:17.965
You can actually see the future.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.093
Yes, I can actually see the future.

13:21.093 --> 13:23.846
- I just thought a psychic would have
the perfect life.

13:23.846 --> 13:24.680
Far from it.

13:24.680 --> 13:26.390
I don't get to choose
who wins the lottery.

13:26.390 --> 13:28.100
I just know that it's not me.

13:28.475 --> 13:29.518
Oh.

13:29.518 --> 13:33.522
- Actually, there's only one real way
to see the future.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.483
What? What?

13:38.777 --> 13:40.821
- Fortune cookies.
- Ah, fortune cookies.

13:41.280 --> 13:42.739
- You fell for that.
- That was, that was nice.

13:42.739 --> 13:43.657
- Well done.
- Hard.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.493
Okay. One, two.

13:52.249 --> 13:55.043
- "Good things come in threes."
- Mm.

13:55.043 --> 13:57.004
And no breaks this time.

13:57.004 --> 13:58.005
Okay.

14:02.509 --> 14:03.468
Good morning.

14:04.553 --> 14:06.763
- Hey. Good morning.
- Hi.

14:06.763 --> 14:09.224
So how late were we up?

14:09.224 --> 14:10.309
Ooh, well, pretty late.

14:10.309 --> 14:12.060
We went from our first kiss
to our first fight.

14:12.060 --> 14:15.314
- Okay, Maggie, place with the fat chef
is the best pizza in LA.

14:15.314 --> 14:16.231
Why would the skinny chef be better?

14:16.231 --> 14:19.276
- Because that guy is from Italy
and the other's from Nebraska.

14:19.276 --> 14:21.403
Gotcha.

14:21.403 --> 14:22.321
What?

14:22.321 --> 14:25.407
- No, it's just nice to hear you
call them first, not last.

14:29.828 --> 14:31.205
I want to tell you something.

14:32.206 --> 14:33.624
I want to listen.

14:33.624 --> 14:35.667
About the reading I gave you.

14:35.667 --> 14:36.877
- Mm-hmm.
- About

14:37.753 --> 14:38.879
you and me.

14:39.755 --> 14:40.589
Yeah?

14:51.808 --> 14:53.810
What? What is it?

14:55.312 --> 14:58.774
Uh... in your reading,

14:58.774 --> 15:01.193
I saw your future,

15:02.194 --> 15:03.362
and I know how things end.

15:03.362 --> 15:04.404
This doesn't work out.

15:06.281 --> 15:09.910
- Okay. Um, but we had fun, right?
We had fun.

15:09.910 --> 15:12.996
So I'm supposed to let you throw that away

15:12.996 --> 15:15.040
because you think it might not happen?

15:15.832 --> 15:17.584
I know it won't happen.

15:19.169 --> 15:20.087
Wow.

15:21.547 --> 15:23.131
I'm not heartbroken.

15:23.131 --> 15:25.133
I am whatever
the one-night stand equivalent is.

15:25.133 --> 15:26.844
I'm penis crushed,

15:26.844 --> 15:28.637
which is something
that actually happened to my cousin.

15:29.638 --> 15:30.931
I thought you would laugh at that.

15:30.931 --> 15:32.641
I'm sorry. I'm going to go.

15:32.641 --> 15:33.976
- Maggie, I--
- I know.

15:35.894 --> 15:37.104
I had a great time too.

15:37.646 --> 15:39.606
I guess you do know how things end.

15:40.524 --> 15:41.525
I'm sorry.

15:41.942 --> 15:42.734
Yeah.

15:50.534 --> 15:52.828
Well, looks like our time's up.

15:52.828 --> 15:54.496
Remember what I said about your cat.

15:54.496 --> 15:56.248
Uh, one more thing I wanted to ask you.

15:56.248 --> 15:58.667
- Yeah. Your rabbits
will hate the bath, too.

16:00.878 --> 16:02.880
Oh, I made the same mistake.

16:02.880 --> 16:04.256
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:04.256 --> 16:05.674
- Where have you been
the last couple weeks?

16:05.674 --> 16:08.218
I've been texting you
about a very handsome boy

16:08.218 --> 16:09.595
who's been wanting to see you.

16:09.970 --> 16:10.762
Who?

16:12.472 --> 16:13.974
I rescued him.

16:15.058 --> 16:15.976
My God, Lou.

16:15.976 --> 16:19.354
- I didn't think it through at all,
but I have no regrets.

16:19.855 --> 16:20.814
What do you think?

16:26.153 --> 16:28.197
I think he's your soul mate.

16:28.197 --> 16:29.823
Oh, you hear that?

16:29.823 --> 16:31.116
You're stuck with me.

16:31.116 --> 16:32.367
Yes! Ohh!

16:32.367 --> 16:34.453
- I haven't gotten tongue
in a while.

16:35.245 --> 16:37.497
What's going on?
I was hoping I hadn't heard from you

16:37.497 --> 16:40.792
because you were getting busy
with our future husband.

16:40.792 --> 16:41.585
Huh?

16:41.585 --> 16:43.253
Or maybe started your own murder podcast?

16:43.253 --> 16:44.505
No, actually, turns out

16:44.505 --> 16:46.798
I don't always see the whole picture.

16:46.798 --> 16:48.926
Yeah, he ends up with some brunette.

16:48.926 --> 16:50.969
- Well, she sounds awful.
- It's fine.

16:50.969 --> 16:53.430
I've accepted
my predetermined life of solitude

16:53.430 --> 16:54.848
and Mr. Rogers sex dreams.

16:54.848 --> 16:56.308
It's not so bad.

16:56.308 --> 16:57.768
Lots of forehead kisses.

16:57.768 --> 16:59.144
Oh, I love that.

16:59.770 --> 17:01.188
Oh my god, guess what?

17:01.188 --> 17:03.607
My parents finally kicked the bee guy out.

17:03.607 --> 17:04.733
I have to let the new tenant in.

17:04.733 --> 17:07.945
- What? You did not tell me?
Do I look okay?

17:07.945 --> 17:10.447
- It's a girl.
- Oh.

17:10.447 --> 17:13.075
I still don't get why your parents
won't let me move in here.

17:13.075 --> 17:15.744
Is it because I walked in
on your dad taking a pee?

17:15.744 --> 17:17.579
I didn't see anything.
He was sitting down.

17:17.579 --> 17:19.289
- Yeah, I think that's the part
that bothers him.

17:19.748 --> 17:21.542
Hi. Are you Maggie?

17:21.542 --> 17:22.626
- Yeah.
- Oh, sorry.

17:22.626 --> 17:24.086
Your mom said you didn't like questions.

17:24.086 --> 17:25.587
I'm the new neighbor, Jessie.

17:25.587 --> 17:27.548
- Oh.
- Have we met before?

17:27.548 --> 17:28.841
I don't think so.

17:29.508 --> 17:31.093
Do you ever watch hair tutorials online?

17:31.093 --> 17:32.761
That's how I know you.

17:32.761 --> 17:35.222
Yeah. You taught me how to do side braids.

17:35.222 --> 17:37.015
I ended up looking like Willie Nelson,

17:37.015 --> 17:38.141
but I think that's a problem more

17:38.141 --> 17:39.935
with my forehead than my hair.

17:39.935 --> 17:41.478
Well, I'm just happy to meet you.

17:41.478 --> 17:43.230
We were a little worried

17:43.230 --> 17:44.606
about who would be living above us.

17:44.606 --> 17:47.067
- Don't worry, babe. I saved
the heavy boxes for you. Thanks.

17:47.067 --> 17:47.901
Thanks. BEN: Yeah.

17:47.901 --> 17:49.486
- Ben.
- Maggie.

17:49.486 --> 17:50.737
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

17:50.737 --> 17:51.697
I live here.

17:52.656 --> 17:54.283
What are you doing here?

17:54.283 --> 17:56.535
I live here. Now. With Jessie.

18:02.416 --> 18:04.751
- You guys all know each other?
- Yeah, well, sorta.

18:04.751 --> 18:07.838
Uh, Maggie once gave me
a... psychic reading.

18:07.838 --> 18:08.797
Yeah. JESSIE: No way.

18:08.797 --> 18:09.965
I love psychics.

18:09.965 --> 18:11.717
I'm actually a little psychic.

18:11.717 --> 18:13.218
I once went on a cruise, and I knew

18:13.218 --> 18:15.429
the pool was going to get closed down
from a feces-related incident.

18:15.429 --> 18:17.139
Ugh. Cruises are great.

18:17.139 --> 18:18.307
- Hey, Mag--

18:18.932 --> 18:20.434
Brother and his girlfriend

18:20.434 --> 18:22.311
and people I've probably
never ever met before.

18:23.228 --> 18:25.772
Whoa. Is no one else seeing these bees?

18:25.772 --> 18:28.609
- Ben's sister Amy has a minivan,
so she's helping us move.

18:28.609 --> 18:30.944
- Yeah, we just,
it makes no sense as a car

18:30.944 --> 18:32.237
because we aren't having kids.

18:32.237 --> 18:33.906
We don't even want them.

18:33.906 --> 18:35.199
Big Gulps fit in the cupholders,

18:35.199 --> 18:36.617
so it actually makes a ton of sense.

18:36.617 --> 18:38.035
Oh.

18:40.120 --> 18:42.122
"Good things come in threes."

18:43.123 --> 18:44.875
You framed this. JESSIE: Isn't that cute?

18:44.875 --> 18:46.877
Ben and I broke up twice last year,

18:46.877 --> 18:48.045
but then he got that fortune

18:48.045 --> 18:49.838
and we ran into each other
a few weeks later.

18:49.838 --> 18:51.381
-Ah.
- As Ben likes to say,

18:51.924 --> 18:54.009
- you can't fight fate.
- Mm-mm.

18:54.009 --> 18:54.968
Amazing.

18:55.594 --> 18:56.470
Blessings.

Hey, everyone's eating pizza

19:17.324 --> 19:18.617
from the place with the fat chef.

19:18.617 --> 19:19.660
You should come down.

19:19.660 --> 19:20.744
Why?

19:20.744 --> 19:22.204
Okay.

19:22.829 --> 19:25.541
- I thought I was actually going
to marry somebody.

19:25.541 --> 19:28.627
And now he's living downstairs
with his girlfriend.

19:29.837 --> 19:32.673
I have no idea what my future
looks like anymore.

19:32.673 --> 19:35.467
Well, nobody does.

19:35.467 --> 19:38.220
We're all just trying to make
the best choices with the information

19:38.220 --> 19:39.596

19:40.848 --> 19:42.891
Welcome to living in the moment.

19:42.891 --> 19:44.852
How am I supposed to handle that?

19:46.395 --> 19:48.397
I mean, I just hope that things work out

19:48.397 --> 19:50.607
and eat a steady flow
of pizza until they do.

19:55.028 --> 19:56.738
Thank you. I love it when you do that.

I'm so glad you guys are here.

20:14.089 --> 20:15.382
Hi!

20:22.181 --> 20:24.808
- Hi.
- Jack and Maria. Dad, sit down.

20:24.808 --> 20:26.977
- Okay.
- Yeah, we know you love to sit, Jack.

20:26.977 --> 20:28.687
- Okay. Honey, why don't you
sit down there,

20:28.687 --> 20:29.771
because I like to stand.

20:32.232 --> 20:33.275
My turn.

20:34.067 --> 20:35.319
My turn.

20:35.319 --> 20:36.486
What would you like?

20:40.365 --> 20:42.492
Cheers!

20:57.716 --> 20:59.176
Mm.

20:59.176 --> 21:00.636
These should be illegal.

21:00.636 --> 21:01.887
Mm.

21:01.887 --> 21:03.555
Did that boy move into your duplex yet?

21:03.555 --> 21:04.765
You knew.

21:04.765 --> 21:07.100
What about the "girlfriend," though?

21:07.100 --> 21:08.769
Do we think the pot found a lid?

21:08.769 --> 21:11.063
- Why don't you tell me?
You're my psychic.

21:11.063 --> 21:12.523
- Oh, you're just going
to make me work today?

21:12.523 --> 21:13.857
- Yeah, that's why I'm here.
- Alright.

A little fuel.

21:16.318 --> 21:17.653
A little more fuel.

21:17.653 --> 21:19.446
- Can you eat that a little faster?
- Okay.

21:19.446 --> 21:20.280
Come on.

21:24.743 --> 21:26.912
- What? What? What is it?

21:26.912 --> 21:28.038
Oh.

21:29.248 --> 21:31.166
Time's up. I'll see you next week.

21:31.750 --> 21:33.585
This is going to be good.
