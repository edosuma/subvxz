01:02.229 --> 01:04.565
You know what they say
about a watched pot.

01:05.691 --> 01:07.109
But they're so late.

01:07.109 --> 01:10.279
In a few hours, this house
will be filled with New York's finest.

01:10.279 --> 01:15.617
Well, I would say New York's finest
is already right here.

01:16.535 --> 01:18.161
You'll crease my dress.

01:20.998 --> 01:22.791
Why, thank you, Mr. Colonel, sir.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.339
Well, I don't give a fig
about anyone else coming.

01:29.923 --> 01:33.177
Actually, Mrs. Paramore responded
and said she was looking forward to it.

01:33.177 --> 01:34.970
But I don't give a fig about any of them.

01:35.470 --> 01:38.765
Well, Patti, both daughters triumphant.

01:38.765 --> 01:42.603
Why, even the papers
have heard of the duke's arrival.

01:48.066 --> 01:52.738
You are good to keep me company
while Theo's away. Are you bored?

01:53.739 --> 01:54.740
Not at all.

01:54.740 --> 01:57.492
I am. And you never bore me, generally.

01:58.285 --> 02:00.204
I was hoping for diverting conversation,

02:00.204 --> 02:02.331
but you're unusually short of
disgraceful stories.

02:02.331 --> 02:07.503
Just tired. Late nights,
you know how it is.

02:07.503 --> 02:09.253
Not recently, unfortunately.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.217
But it's not that. Are you in love?

02:15.385 --> 02:16.220
Sorry?

02:16.220 --> 02:19.264
Your mother held her shoulders like that
after she met your father.

02:21.475 --> 02:25.020
Some kind of dancing injury,
if I know her.

02:25.020 --> 02:30.400
Guy, in the nicest way, what are you doing
here with your shoulders like that?

02:30.400 --> 02:31.485
What are you waiting for?

02:32.653 --> 02:34.279
Theo's a duke, poor lamb.

02:34.279 --> 02:37.324
He has to carry the burden of waiting
for a suitable girl.

02:37.324 --> 02:39.743
But I don't know if you'd noticed,
you're not that important.

02:40.536 --> 02:41.745
Well, thank you.

02:41.745 --> 02:43.580
If she's suitable to you,

02:44.623 --> 02:48.585
don't be like your father,
politely waiting for life to happen.

02:48.585 --> 02:50.003
Your mother grabbed life.

02:50.838 --> 02:53.090
When she met your father by that lake,

02:53.090 --> 02:55.467
she didn't sit around hoping
he'd come to her.

02:55.467 --> 02:57.678
She declared her love in a letter,

02:57.678 --> 03:00.764
wrote it there and then on the bank
and took it to give to him.

03:00.764 --> 03:02.558
Your grandmother was appalled.

03:03.058 --> 03:08.272
But your father, well,
he loved her her entire life.

03:09.815 --> 03:10.816
We all did.

03:12.401 --> 03:15.028
A life without love is a life half-lived.

03:15.529 --> 03:18.240
And from my grand old age, Guy,
let me promise you,

03:18.240 --> 03:21.743
you're a long time dead
and you're even longer old.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.037
Now, pass me those potatoes.

03:28.083 --> 03:29.376
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

05:30.163 --> 05:33.959
Well, well, well,
what time do you call this?

05:33.959 --> 05:36.962
- Oh, sweetheart. Welcome home.
- Hi, Dad.

05:36.962 --> 05:39.631
Nan. Come on, my girls.

05:40.799 --> 05:43.177
Is she doing her funny arms dance?

05:43.677 --> 05:44.887
Go, go.

05:45.596 --> 05:47.097
My little girls.

05:49.016 --> 05:51.268
My two little girls are home.

05:54.897 --> 05:56.356
- Colonel.
- Yes.

05:57.941 --> 06:00.527
Mrs. St. George. So very pleased
to make your acquaintance.

06:00.527 --> 06:03.488
Oh, well, the pleasure is all ours.

06:04.823 --> 06:06.700
I gotta hug you!

06:06.700 --> 06:08.660
It's so good to meet you.

06:09.703 --> 06:12.247
And Jinny got herself a lord.

06:12.247 --> 06:14.666
Check it out, Madison Avenue!

06:16.335 --> 06:17.669
Let us get your bags.

06:17.669 --> 06:20.214
No, we didn't want to impose.
So we're staying at the Grand.

06:21.924 --> 06:23.926
The Grand. What a treat.

06:24.676 --> 06:27.346
- Someone wants to say hello.
- Everybody's here.

06:28.514 --> 06:30.766
- Do you wanna hold her?
- Yes. Yes, please.

06:30.766 --> 06:34.686
Miss Testvalley,
both my daughters happy and settled,

06:34.686 --> 06:35.938
and it's all down to you.

06:37.147 --> 06:38.315
Yes.

06:38.315 --> 06:42.819
Well, we do our best, of course.
But it's not what you're used to, I know.

06:42.819 --> 06:44.655
We picked all the furniture ourselves,

06:44.655 --> 06:47.282
and I'm afraid the paintings
aren't the least bit old.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.911
- Is that a dove in a cage?
- Yes.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.872
We're having a party
with food and people--

06:53.872 --> 06:56.166
No, we know what a party is.
Why are we having one?

06:56.166 --> 06:57.417
To welcome you home.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.462
We've had so many RSVPs, you have no idea.

07:00.462 --> 07:04.341
The Astors, the Cliffords.
Perhaps even the Paramores.

07:04.341 --> 07:06.051
But why is there a dove in a cage?

07:06.051 --> 07:10.180
Mrs. Cooper-Lockhart had a heron.
It's to do with birds being chic.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.391
And my color scheme is dove-themed.

07:13.141 --> 07:15.394
Excellent. Now, who's ready
for a man's drink

07:15.394 --> 07:19.147
away from all this twittering? Gentlemen.

07:19.147 --> 07:21.692
Girls, quick, quick.
You all need to get washed.

07:21.692 --> 07:24.236
I am so sorry. I did not know
that there was going to be a party--

07:24.236 --> 07:27.364
No, I'm intrigued.
Will the doves be let out at some point?

07:28.532 --> 07:30.242
Will Mrs. Somebody-Somebody
bring her heron?

07:31.952 --> 07:33.912
I think anything at all is possible.

07:36.039 --> 07:40.043
Darling, please.
The guests will be arriving any minute

07:40.043 --> 07:41.837
- and I wanna show you off.
- Why?

07:42.337 --> 07:44.006
Well, because I'm your mother.

07:48.927 --> 07:52.097
Well, look who's lowering the tone.

07:52.931 --> 07:55.142
Lizzy!

07:59.771 --> 08:01.064
- Lizzy.
- Lizzy!

08:01.064 --> 08:03.442
- I missed you. Hi.
- Hi.

08:03.442 --> 08:06.069
- So happy to see you!
- What have you been doing?

08:06.069 --> 08:08.155
- Or should I say who have you been doing?
- Yes!

08:08.155 --> 08:10.908
Who's the lucky man
keeping you here and away from us?

08:10.908 --> 08:12.576
I couldn't care less
about boys and marriage.

08:12.576 --> 08:15.621
Lizzy? Who's stolen Lizzy?

08:17.372 --> 08:20.167
Now, there's a party
that's about to start.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.211
So, let's get you all dressed.

08:22.794 --> 08:24.505
Happy to see you home.

08:30.511 --> 08:31.929
Gentlemen, shall we?

09:08.841 --> 09:11.426
So sorry. Sorry.
I think I gave you a telegram to send.

09:11.426 --> 09:13.178
- Yes, sir.
- But I need it back.

09:13.679 --> 09:15.430
I have to get it back.
I have to get that--

09:15.430 --> 09:21.436
Took a while for them to transcribe, sir.
And not cheap, I'm afraid, being so long.

09:22.604 --> 09:23.605
Right.

09:24.773 --> 09:28.318
Right. Yes, it was a lengthy one.

09:31.280 --> 09:32.364
Thank you very much.

09:33.615 --> 09:34.783
So sorry to--

10:04.563 --> 10:08.734
My two favorite dancers.
Listen, go have fun.

10:14.573 --> 10:15.574
Duke!

10:16.283 --> 10:19.953
Is it duke or duke?

10:19.953 --> 10:23.332
Anyhow, so you have your drink?
Sorry it's not tea.

10:25.250 --> 10:26.710
Will Nan be joining us?

10:27.753 --> 10:30.255
She'll no doubt be getting
into trouble somewhere.

10:30.255 --> 10:34.218
So, how did you convince
our little free spirit to say yes?

10:34.718 --> 10:37.346
The minute she could walk,
no one could catch her.

10:37.846 --> 10:40.641
Well, I think I'm just hoping
to walk alongside her.

10:40.641 --> 10:43.644
Nice.
That's a nice line, Nan's a lucky girl.

10:48.607 --> 10:52.819
Mrs. Paramore, welcome.
I know how in demand you are.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.613
We wouldn't have missed it.

10:55.113 --> 10:58.075
You've gone for doves, I see.

10:58.075 --> 11:02.246
The Astors only had canaries at theirs,
and they didn't look well.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.581
The canaries or the Astors?

11:05.958 --> 11:06.959
Both.

11:08.168 --> 11:12.589
Congratulations, Mrs. St. George.
How very far you've come.

11:28.105 --> 11:29.106
Nan?

11:35.904 --> 11:36.905
Nan?

11:38.115 --> 11:40.659
Well, I'm just gonna wait
right here then, okay?

11:41.201 --> 11:42.786
Nan, you said you wouldn't today.

11:42.786 --> 11:46.957
Now that I'm actually in this house,
I can't simply just make my face pretend.

11:47.457 --> 11:48.458
Girls.

11:49.209 --> 11:50.252
Girls.

11:52.254 --> 11:53.797
Well, I'm happy for them.

11:54.506 --> 11:58.552
For my part, the doves are a step too far.
But Patricia's never shy of excess.

11:59.344 --> 12:01.305
Who is, in New York?

12:01.305 --> 12:02.764
Whereas if it had been me--

12:03.348 --> 12:05.184
- Lizzy, if you hadn't--
- Disappointed the family?

12:05.184 --> 12:06.393
Let us all down?

12:06.393 --> 12:10.105
Decided, for whatever reason,
ill-health or over-excitement,

12:10.105 --> 12:13.734
to take yourself away, perhaps we'd be
holding a party of this kind.

12:15.277 --> 12:20.240
Well, I'm just saying, you were the pick
of that ball on that staircase.

12:20.240 --> 12:24.953
Everyone said so. And if you'd only agree
to go back to England and try it out--

12:24.953 --> 12:27.039
- What?
- Oh, yes, she refuses.

12:27.039 --> 12:29.333
Now that she's met the queen,
she thinks she is one.

12:29.333 --> 12:31.960
- Perhaps if I had had daughters more--
- Agreeable?

12:31.960 --> 12:33.420
- Obedient?
- Appealing!

12:33.420 --> 12:36.215
There, you've made me say it.
I've said it, appealing.

12:37.841 --> 12:39.843
- I have to go find Jinny.
- Wait, Lizzy.

12:41.595 --> 12:45.807
I'm just saying, if you'd both been
more open to the process,

12:45.807 --> 12:47.059
this could've been our party.

12:47.059 --> 12:48.602
Yeah. Well, only without the doves, right?

12:48.602 --> 12:50.354
The doves are a step too far, certainly.

12:52.689 --> 12:55.526
In polite society, you don't actually
drink a drink, you know?

12:55.526 --> 12:58.570
I believe you do drink drinks, Mother.

12:58.570 --> 13:01.657
Mabel, I was a girl once and thought
I knew what was what.

13:02.157 --> 13:05.077
But I'm afraid gradually you're forced
to realize, you know nothing at all.

13:06.662 --> 13:09.373
When the others go back to England,
you'll be staying here with me.

13:09.373 --> 13:12.209
What? No, I can't.

13:12.209 --> 13:13.919
I'm afraid if Lizzy's here
then so are you.

13:13.919 --> 13:16.839
What would people say if I have
daughters on different continents?

13:16.839 --> 13:19.258
Your sister has ruined it for us all.

13:23.428 --> 13:24.763
Mother, please, she just--

13:26.598 --> 13:27.850
Nan, what is it?

13:31.979 --> 13:33.105
Everyone's down there.

13:36.817 --> 13:41.697
I'm nobody to you.
You have never been my mother.

13:44.950 --> 13:47.995
Everything you've told me
my entire life has been a complete--

13:47.995 --> 13:51.415
Jinny, go downstairs, please.

13:51.415 --> 13:53.584
I'm so sorry. This is all my fault.

13:53.584 --> 13:59.506
This isn't about faults, darling.
Now, go downstairs and enjoy your moment.

14:04.011 --> 14:07.556
Shoulders back. Head high.

14:28.952 --> 14:29.953
Sorry!

14:31.788 --> 14:32.789
Sorry.

14:35.959 --> 14:37.044
I don't believe we've met.

14:40.506 --> 14:43.133
- Elizabeth. Lizzy.
- It's a pleasure.

14:46.178 --> 14:48.096
There you are. I'm so sorry.

14:48.096 --> 14:51.099
- I was just-- Are you having a good time?
- Yes.

14:51.099 --> 14:52.893
I've just been introduced to Elizabeth.

14:53.936 --> 14:57.731
But you know Lizzy. She stayed
at your house and at Runnymede.

15:01.151 --> 15:03.153
There were rather
a lot of people there that weekend.

15:04.112 --> 15:05.113
Of course, I--

15:05.113 --> 15:06.615
We were all running around.

15:06.615 --> 15:08.492
I mean, it was a bit of a blur.

15:09.368 --> 15:10.369
I'm sorry, I just--

15:12.287 --> 15:13.288
I'm sorry.

15:22.381 --> 15:26.260
If I had never been born
or if I'd never existed--

15:26.260 --> 15:27.386
Don't, please.

15:27.386 --> 15:31.139
It would have been easier. It would have
been better for you and for Daddy.

15:32.349 --> 15:34.935
The whole family must have been
whispering and nudging,

15:34.935 --> 15:37.855
and having to stop talking
whenever I walked into a room.

15:37.855 --> 15:40.065
It was never like that.

15:40.065 --> 15:45.779
Why did you lie? Every day you woke up,
and you spent the whole day lying to me.

15:47.781 --> 15:52.494
And then the next day you got up,
and you lied to me again.

15:52.995 --> 15:56.874
- Darling, we've made mistakes.
- You've made mistakes.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.961
I'm not yours. My eyes aren't yours.

16:00.961 --> 16:02.754
My hands aren't yours.
My feet aren't yours.

16:02.754 --> 16:05.716
And it was no wonder that I was close
to Daddy when I was small.

16:06.300 --> 16:10.345
I used to feel so bad when I was
so glad that he came home.

16:11.263 --> 16:17.060
But it was because he was my daddy,
and you were nobody. You're nobody.

16:18.103 --> 16:20.314
- Please, wait--
- I thought being here would help.

16:21.148 --> 16:22.733
That if I could just talk to you...

16:24.318 --> 16:27.237
But you're just parading me to all of
New York, and you're making me lie

16:27.237 --> 16:28.780
and I can't look at you.

16:28.780 --> 16:33.702
We just need to gather ourselves.
Darling, come sit down.

16:34.912 --> 16:38.332
Your father's looking after Theo.
We can just talk.

16:41.293 --> 16:42.711
And you're making me lie to Theo.

16:43.629 --> 16:45.631
How can he marry me
when he doesn't know who I am?

16:45.631 --> 16:48.759
When I don't even know who I am?
My whole life has been a lie.

16:49.676 --> 16:50.969
I need to tell him the truth.

16:54.306 --> 16:57.768
Nan? Nan?

17:07.486 --> 17:08.529
Nan.

17:11.281 --> 17:12.324
Nan!

17:32.553 --> 17:33.929
Mrs. St. George, can I just--

17:37.474 --> 17:40.143
- There you are. I've been meaning to--
- Not now, Lavinia.

17:44.314 --> 17:45.315
Theo.

17:49.486 --> 17:51.071
Here she is, the best-looking

17:51.071 --> 17:53.490
- mother of the bride I ever saw.
- No, stop. Where's Nan?

17:53.490 --> 17:54.950
- You know it's time for--
- I have to go.

17:55.450 --> 17:58.245
Ladies and gentlemen,
we know how heartbroken you were

17:58.245 --> 18:00.289
to miss the wedding of the year.

18:00.289 --> 18:01.957
So by way of second best,

18:01.957 --> 18:05.085
will you please help me give
a big New York welcome

18:05.085 --> 18:08.338
to Lord and Lady Seadown.

18:12.968 --> 18:16.263
Come on, it's not a first dance
until you've done it in New York.

18:21.727 --> 18:24.688
Oh, come on. Let's show these children
how it's done, Patti.

18:24.688 --> 18:26.148
Tracy, I have to talk to you.

18:28.567 --> 18:29.651
Get your hands off me!

19:02.434 --> 19:03.560
For pity's sake, Patti.

19:03.560 --> 19:05.854
If you don't want to dance,
you just have to--

19:08.815 --> 19:09.983
Nan knows.

19:17.533 --> 19:19.826
I guess they just thought
it would be nice for us to--

19:19.826 --> 19:23.872
To be paraded?
To stage a fake first dance?

19:25.457 --> 19:28.752
Well apt, I suppose, because in America,
everything is a reproduction.

19:36.051 --> 19:37.052
Does the duke know?

19:37.845 --> 19:39.346
She says she'll tell him.

19:39.346 --> 19:41.765
Well, then she's a fool. She'll lose him.

19:41.765 --> 19:44.726
A duke can never marry a girl like that.

19:44.726 --> 19:48.021
- What about her? What about me?
- All right.

19:50.315 --> 19:51.483
I'll fix it.

19:51.483 --> 19:55.112
This isn't one of those times
you can go in and make her laugh, Tracy.

19:55.112 --> 19:57.906
Have one of your little nudges
about the world together,

19:57.906 --> 20:00.951
about how silly and how amusing
I always am.

20:01.994 --> 20:03.829
This is entirely your fault.

20:03.829 --> 20:07.791
Do you have any idea what we've sacrificed
for your utter belief

20:07.791 --> 20:10.002
that you can do exactly as you please?

20:10.002 --> 20:12.379
Well, I must say,
when I look at that party out there,

20:12.379 --> 20:14.548
with all those orchids and that food
and that furniture,

20:14.548 --> 20:16.884
it doesn't seem to me much
like anybody's making any sacrifices.

20:16.884 --> 20:19.595
I don't care for a stick of
that furniture, not a stick!

20:19.595 --> 20:21.471
You have turned us into liars!

20:23.640 --> 20:27.853
I have battled to keep this family
together, and I will continue to do so.

20:29.396 --> 20:32.232
And if it will be all right,
it is because I will make it all right.

20:37.654 --> 20:38.655
I love New York!

20:38.655 --> 20:40.199
New York loves you.

20:41.491 --> 20:42.951
I can breathe here.

20:44.661 --> 20:45.787
I feel free.

20:46.705 --> 20:47.956
Just like--

20:48.457 --> 20:51.043
Just like when I was a little boy,
and I could just run around

20:51.043 --> 20:52.044
all day long

20:52.628 --> 20:54.463
before I had to wear such tight breeches.

20:55.047 --> 20:57.466
You know, I do like you in looser pants.

20:58.300 --> 21:01.220
God, do you remember those
nights before the wedding?

21:01.220 --> 21:02.971
Those afternoons.

21:02.971 --> 21:04.181
Those mornings.

21:05.933 --> 21:06.934
Shall we...

21:08.143 --> 21:09.686
In the St. George house?

21:10.187 --> 21:13.607
Well, Conchita, this is America.

21:15.609 --> 21:16.777
Land of the free.

21:18.362 --> 21:19.363
Come on.

21:28.288 --> 21:30.374
- Jinny.
- There you are.

21:30.374 --> 21:33.085
- We wanted to say congratulations.
- Congratulations.

21:33.085 --> 21:38.048
You married a real English gentleman.
A lord, no less.

21:38.048 --> 21:40.008
- And we heard you two had--
- You eloped!

21:41.635 --> 21:44.388
- So romantic.
- So fabulous.

21:44.388 --> 21:48.100
So, how is England?
Do you live in a palace?

21:48.100 --> 21:49.893
Is everything really old?

21:49.893 --> 21:53.981
It is, but it's old and beautiful,
not old and dirty, you know.

21:53.981 --> 21:56.608
Lords and ladies have exquisite taste.

21:56.608 --> 21:59.111
I always knew Jinny would go far.

21:59.903 --> 22:02.281
- If I didn't say, I thought it.
- You did.

22:02.281 --> 22:06.660
- And so did I.
- And that gown Jenny, it's so elegant.

22:06.660 --> 22:09.705
So elegant.

22:11.164 --> 22:13.625
Yes, I believe I've already said it.

22:23.760 --> 22:26.513
Lizzy, what are you playing at?

22:26.513 --> 22:28.891
If we have to stay here with Mother,
I shall die.

22:28.891 --> 22:30.184
You won't die.

22:30.184 --> 22:31.768
How do you know? I might.

22:32.477 --> 22:35.981
- This all used to feel so familiar and--
- Safe.

22:37.191 --> 22:41.403
- Yes. And now it's--
- It's different.

22:46.158 --> 22:48.243
Is this still because Seadown chose her?

22:51.663 --> 22:55.834
Mabel, you are so much more like Mother
than you will ever see

22:55.834 --> 22:59.922
because you know nothing at all
about anything.

23:28.116 --> 23:31.078
- So, tell us more about your--
- Big castle.

23:32.621 --> 23:35.123
- It's not really a castle.
- What's it called?

23:35.707 --> 23:38.502
Tintagel... Castle.

23:41.713 --> 23:44.341
Well, I bet
the St. George's can't believe their luck.

23:44.341 --> 23:49.513
I mean, look around. It's all
rather gauche, isn't it? This new money?

23:51.515 --> 23:54.101
Well, you could say
America is all new money.

23:55.435 --> 23:57.437
Excuse me, I must find my fiancé.

24:51.992 --> 24:55.037
If you find any bills in there
you wanna pay, you go right ahead.

24:55.037 --> 24:58.081
- Be my guest.
- Jinny told me there were letters.

25:04.713 --> 25:08.967
Funny thing about getting older,
stories you thought were long buried--

25:09.718 --> 25:14.348
Well, they rear their heads again
and they don't always make you feel good.

25:14.890 --> 25:16.517
How does it make you feel?

25:17.142 --> 25:21.855
Wanting me to talk about my feelings, huh?
Well, you get that from your mother.

25:28.862 --> 25:30.155
You wanna know the truth?

25:31.573 --> 25:32.574
Old.

25:33.742 --> 25:36.078
Old is what I feel, Nan.

25:36.912 --> 25:38.622
Seems impossible when you're young,
I know.

25:38.622 --> 25:40.958
But that way you feel
when you're running and laughing

25:41.667 --> 25:43.919
and dancing with those friends
of yours, you--

25:45.546 --> 25:46.630
Well, one day...

25:49.341 --> 25:51.385
you will follow that feeling anywhere.

25:52.094 --> 25:53.303
Ask anyone my age,

25:53.303 --> 25:56.807
we're, all of us,
just pretending to be grown-ups.

25:59.977 --> 26:02.020
You know, when your belt's bursting,

26:02.020 --> 26:04.398
your hair is thin on top,

26:04.398 --> 26:08.360
and suddenly a beautiful young girl smiles
at you and laughs at your joke...

26:08.360 --> 26:11.238
Well, you know,
a man can't be blamed for seeing.

26:11.238 --> 26:13.365
Hell, she wants you to see it.

26:14.074 --> 26:15.200
And meanwhile, yes,

26:15.200 --> 26:18.287
your mother is still
the finest-looking woman in the land,

26:18.287 --> 26:24.251
but, you know, she gets tired and cranky.
So, occasionally the--

26:24.251 --> 26:27.129
Where is she? My real mother.

26:30.215 --> 26:31.466
Oh, sweetheart...

26:33.510 --> 26:37.639
Her family sent word that she passed on
not long after you were born.

26:40.851 --> 26:41.852
And who was she?

26:46.315 --> 26:47.316
We--

26:48.108 --> 26:49.193
Well, she was--

26:52.279 --> 26:54.198
It was a long time ago. And--

26:54.198 --> 26:55.407
Well, what'd she look like?

26:57.284 --> 26:59.369
I expect she was very beautiful.

26:59.369 --> 27:01.371
That much I can tell you because--

27:01.371 --> 27:05.125
Well, you know, look at you.

27:07.336 --> 27:08.545
And what was her name?

27:15.886 --> 27:17.846
I didn't get a proper look at her, Nan.

27:23.894 --> 27:25.312
Nan.

27:34.321 --> 27:40.285
Being away from New York, Mother,
I'm so much more myself.

27:40.285 --> 27:41.703
I imagine.

27:42.329 --> 27:45.624
And of course,
I've barely missed you at all.

27:47.918 --> 27:49.169
So...

27:49.837 --> 27:54.091
is there anyone in England like us?

27:55.175 --> 27:56.218
Like you?

27:58.303 --> 28:00.097
Oh, well, you should see them all.

28:02.266 --> 28:04.268
There's not a single person like me.

28:40.846 --> 28:41.805
Thank you.

29:01.074 --> 29:02.576
<i>My dearest Nan,</i>

29:03.869 --> 29:06.538
<i>my feelings for you can no longer
be kept secret.</i>

29:08.081 --> 29:11.043
<i>I am weak. And I'm confused.</i>

29:11.752 --> 29:15.088
<i>But Nan, my love for you is neither.</i>

29:18.509 --> 29:20.469
So, what did she say?

29:21.720 --> 29:25.432
I talked to them both.
She didn't speak, and he didn't listen.

29:27.309 --> 29:31.563
He said that pretty girls give him a look
which they hope he'll notice.

29:32.314 --> 29:33.690
And he can't be blamed.

29:34.691 --> 29:36.652
How can Mother even stand it?

29:37.402 --> 29:40.572
I think she just gets on with the day.

29:41.615 --> 29:43.700
I suppose that's what marriage becomes.

29:44.868 --> 29:48.163
Daddy will always be impossible.

29:49.122 --> 29:52.793
But Nan, Mother, our mother, she--

29:53.752 --> 29:55.879
she loves you entirely.

29:58.173 --> 29:59.633
Fix your face, darling.

30:46.013 --> 30:47.431
You got to join the party.

30:49.099 --> 30:50.642
Almost like I'm a real person.

30:52.102 --> 30:54.980
- Is Minnie...
- Safely asleep upstairs.

30:59.026 --> 31:00.611
He's so carefree here.

31:00.611 --> 31:03.405
None of those children will
ever be carefree.

31:08.827 --> 31:12.456
Growing up in the Brightlingsea house,
I'm afraid that's just not possible.

31:13.332 --> 31:14.333
They get...

31:16.210 --> 31:17.753
extinguished.

31:22.549 --> 31:24.343
We have to get away from his family.

31:27.095 --> 31:28.889
Lady Marable, if I may,

31:28.889 --> 31:32.851
Lord Richard is an Englishman,
a firstborn and a lord.

31:34.186 --> 31:37.898
Yes, but look at him.
Why wouldn't he choose this?

31:38.690 --> 31:42.194
He may not always feel it under that roof,
but in England he has power.

31:43.904 --> 31:47.199
No Englishman will ever choose
freedom over power.

32:14.810 --> 32:16.436
Have you had anything to eat?

32:45.299 --> 32:47.134
You're right, of course.

32:49.136 --> 32:50.846
I've made mistakes. Plenty.

32:51.972 --> 32:54.266
But I wouldn't believe any mother
who claimed she hadn't.

32:55.350 --> 32:58.103
And I was doing my very best. I was.

32:59.730 --> 33:01.732
I may not have carried you in here.

33:05.152 --> 33:10.449
But from the second I saw you,
I promise you, I have carried you in here.

33:21.835 --> 33:23.337
The day you came to me

33:25.172 --> 33:29.843
was the best and the hardest day
of my life.

33:33.472 --> 33:35.724
My heart was broken
because of your father.

33:38.519 --> 33:42.189
But it had no idea what was coming,
this old heart of mine.

33:44.191 --> 33:48.111
With your eyes and your little fingers.

33:48.820 --> 33:52.324
And your thighs,
I could grab a whole handful.

33:54.660 --> 33:56.787
And don't tell me
that your eyes aren't mine,

33:58.121 --> 34:01.792
because I've stared into them night
after night when you wouldn't settle.

34:03.919 --> 34:08.422
And your fingers are mine,
because I kiss them again and again.

34:09.882 --> 34:11.552
You nestled into my heart

34:11.552 --> 34:17.558
and made it so much bigger and brighter
and more important.

34:20.435 --> 34:23.105
When you were this high
and you wanted to climb,

34:23.105 --> 34:25.023
which you always did...

34:26.608 --> 34:29.485
I used to turn my back,
so you wouldn't see that I was scared.

34:30.779 --> 34:34.283
- But you were?
- Are you serious?

34:34.949 --> 34:37.953
I'm a mother and a woman.

34:37.953 --> 34:42.081
And both of those are terrifying
every single day.

34:43.375 --> 34:47.295
But I didn't want you to see from my face
that I was scared for you.

34:48.213 --> 34:50.382
I so wanted you to be fearless.

34:52.134 --> 34:54.094
And if you'd known, if we'd told you,

34:55.971 --> 34:57.723
you'd have been Nan with a secret.

34:59.266 --> 35:01.852
Nan with questions.
Nan that felt different.

35:03.729 --> 35:06.356
And I just wanted you to be Nan.

35:06.982 --> 35:10.736
And maybe that was wrong,
but I was making it up as I went along.

35:11.778 --> 35:13.780
And Daddy says
that everyone in this whole world

35:13.780 --> 35:15.949
is just pretending to be grown-ups.

35:16.700 --> 35:18.202
And he's right, of course.

35:19.494 --> 35:22.414
Though some of us are pretending
a little harder than others.

35:23.665 --> 35:25.083
And, darling, about Theo...

35:26.668 --> 35:28.462
It might feel like a lie,

35:28.462 --> 35:32.216
it might even be called a lie
if you look it up in the dictionary, but...

35:34.551 --> 35:35.677
you'll lose him.

35:37.012 --> 35:40.265
And I don't think it's a lie
when it's to protect someone you love.

35:40.265 --> 35:43.602
It's okay to turn your back
to hide that you're scared.

35:44.144 --> 35:48.023
But Theo's honest. He's not like Daddy.

35:49.191 --> 35:50.984
And maybe you can let the lies keep coming

35:50.984 --> 35:53.237
- and maybe you're happy with that, but--
- I'm not happy.

35:55.030 --> 35:57.407
And, darling, I need you and Jinny
to know that.

35:58.283 --> 36:00.702
I'm not happy with any of it.

36:04.581 --> 36:05.707
But that's up to me.

36:07.876 --> 36:10.045
I want better than a lifetime of lies.

36:11.755 --> 36:16.051
And I know that you had to turn your back
to make me brave, but I am brave now.

36:19.346 --> 36:23.767
Mostly.
And you've still got your back turned.

37:27.414 --> 37:31.835
Here she is at last, my girl.

37:33.420 --> 37:38.050
So, we now have the duke and his "dukess."

37:39.051 --> 37:43.222
So, now we need a dance from you both.
Come on, we have waited long enough.

37:52.564 --> 37:55.609
Why, Colonel, what makes you think

37:55.609 --> 37:58.195
these young people
want to hang around old folks like us?

37:58.195 --> 38:01.073
They're young and in love.
You must remember that.

38:02.658 --> 38:06.119
Now, come on everybody,
this is supposed to be a New York party.

38:36.692 --> 38:37.860
Nan's gonna tell him.

38:40.863 --> 38:43.198
And I suspect she's absolutely right.

38:53.417 --> 38:55.752
Theo, slow down, slow down, slow down.

38:59.047 --> 39:02.176
Are you okay? Has something happened?

39:14.646 --> 39:17.524
I love you, Nan.

39:20.527 --> 39:21.528
Do you want me?

39:23.989 --> 39:25.407
Do you want me?

39:28.118 --> 39:29.411
I want you to say it.

39:30.537 --> 39:33.165
Yes. Yes, I do. I want you.

39:56.438 --> 39:57.648
Come here.

40:04.821 --> 40:07.699
- I've missed you.
- Hasn't it been just awful?

40:08.575 --> 40:14.373
Listen, I've been wanting--
Darling, what's married life like?

40:16.083 --> 40:18.085
I mean, I'm happy.

40:18.085 --> 40:20.504
When we're together,
when it's just us two,

40:20.504 --> 40:23.590
- he does nothing but look after me.
- I'm glad.

40:23.590 --> 40:25.759
- He treats me like--
- Like a lady?

40:25.759 --> 40:27.052
- Of course.
- Does he really?

40:27.052 --> 40:30.973
Of course. Look, I'm Lady Seadown.

40:44.152 --> 40:47.406
You left me all alone. Again.

40:47.406 --> 40:49.408
I know, I'm so sorry.
I was just catching--

40:49.408 --> 40:51.535
In your house with your family,

40:51.535 --> 40:54.413
who are absolutely not,
I'm realizing, easy people.

40:58.917 --> 41:02.045
I'm just starting to feel all this fuss,
the constant references to who I am.

41:02.045 --> 41:04.131
Did you only marry me for my title?

41:05.382 --> 41:09.261
No, of course not. I love you.

41:09.761 --> 41:12.639
This party is humiliating to me. Humiliating.

41:13.515 --> 41:15.058
This whole vulgar event,

41:15.058 --> 41:17.895
thrown in our honor,
yet a hideous display of bad taste.

41:17.895 --> 41:20.189
I'd have thought I deserved more respect.

41:21.565 --> 41:24.276
- I don't understand.
- From you, my wife,

41:25.319 --> 41:26.320
and also from your mother.

41:27.112 --> 41:30.032
That this is how she chooses
to introduce her new son-in-law

41:30.032 --> 41:33.952
to New York, by parading me and my title.
It is demeaning.

41:34.578 --> 41:38.081
No, you're absolutely right.
And I'm so sorry.

41:38.081 --> 41:41.168
And it gives me no pleasure to say
that your mother ought to apologize.

41:43.504 --> 41:46.173
For the party. The farcical first dance.

41:46.173 --> 41:49.009
That display we just witnessed.
She ought to say sorry.

41:50.886 --> 41:53.597
But you don't
actually mean she ought to apologize?

41:54.181 --> 41:55.933
I'm not going to tell you what to do, Virginia.

42:06.652 --> 42:07.819
Theo.

42:09.655 --> 42:12.574
Just before we go back inside,
I wanted to tell you something.

42:15.118 --> 42:20.249
- I've just been wanting to say--
- Are you happy? With me, I mean.

42:20.958 --> 42:22.292
Of course.

42:22.292 --> 42:24.711
Then don't tell me anything
that might spoil it.

42:28.340 --> 42:29.341
Really?

42:30.843 --> 42:32.052
Let's get married soon.

42:33.804 --> 42:34.930
Might that be all right?

43:07.880 --> 43:08.881
Mother.

43:10.757 --> 43:15.179
This party, the whole event,
the entire afternoon, it's--

43:22.728 --> 43:25.272
Well, it's been a gaudy display
of bad taste.

43:29.610 --> 43:32.321
You've been to England now,
so you know how to behave.

43:32.321 --> 43:34.072
But I'm afraid
James deserves more respect.

43:35.616 --> 43:39.036
You've embarrassed him,
and you've embarrassed me.

43:39.036 --> 43:43.957
So, I would appreciate it
if you would apologize.

43:43.957 --> 43:46.376
Jinny, my love, what's come over you?

43:48.128 --> 43:50.255
I think we should get everyone
dancing again, don't you?

43:50.255 --> 43:55.052
Mrs. St. George, I can't thank you enough
for this delightful party.

43:55.719 --> 43:58.472
You've made me
and my wife feel so welcome.

43:59.556 --> 44:03.393
Well, welcome, of course.
This is Jinny's home.

44:05.896 --> 44:08.857
Perhaps the sea crossing
might have made you a bit queasy.

44:10.400 --> 44:11.527
The aim of this party,

44:11.527 --> 44:14.530
and our whole lives, in fact,
has been our happiness.

44:19.201 --> 44:20.619
I shall become a duchess soon

44:21.370 --> 44:24.581
and have access to royalty of every rank.

44:24.581 --> 44:27.417
But I fully expect to be less impressed
by them than I ought to be,

44:27.417 --> 44:31.004
because our mother...

44:34.716 --> 44:37.928
My mother is a queen.

44:51.608 --> 44:53.318
Shoulders back. Head high.

45:03.537 --> 45:04.997
You're right, of course, Jinny.

45:06.039 --> 45:09.251
Everything about this party is irrelevant
and in bad taste.

45:10.669 --> 45:13.922
In fact, the only thing I'm proud of
in this entire room are you girls.

45:15.924 --> 45:17.092
Both of you.

45:18.218 --> 45:19.887
But I'll reserve my apologies and shame

45:19.887 --> 45:23.140
for the years I spent giving a fig
what people thought of me.

45:23.891 --> 45:27.769
And perhaps one night in Saratoga
when I climbed a wall

45:27.769 --> 45:30.480
and accidentally showed
my second-best bloomers to the Mayor.

45:32.733 --> 45:37.696
Now, Lavinia,
I believe this party is beneath us.

45:37.696 --> 45:40.282
- But it's your party.
- We're just gonna walk out of the room.

45:40.282 --> 45:41.491
- Okay.
- Just--

45:51.293 --> 45:53.504
Do you suppose
everything will be all right, Lavinia?

45:53.504 --> 45:55.422
No idea. None at all.

45:59.551 --> 46:02.262
I believe Tracy is not always a good man.

46:02.262 --> 46:05.849
They so rarely are. What can we do?

46:08.936 --> 46:11.063
Only our very best to be grown-ups.

46:28.455 --> 46:31.458
I can't just move to New York.

46:32.167 --> 46:36.505
Why not? Please, Dicky.
We could just stay here.

46:37.089 --> 46:40.008
I can't be in that house. I can't live.

46:41.593 --> 46:44.304
And I won't let
Minnie be extinguished by your family.

46:49.601 --> 46:51.520
You've decided you've no choice
and that's up to you.

46:51.520 --> 46:53.146
But I do have a choice.

46:57.901 --> 47:00.112
I just need to decide which one to make.

47:34.646 --> 47:40.736
Mother, I'm gonna go back to England
with the girls. To be with Jinny.

47:42.321 --> 47:46.366
Find myself a husband, if I can.
And Mabel can come with me.

47:46.366 --> 47:48.660
Oh, Lizzy, that's the spirit.

47:50.329 --> 47:51.705
I believe in you. I do.

47:53.582 --> 47:55.417
- Thank you.
- Of course.

47:57.961 --> 48:01.548
So, Duchess Nan,
when are we going back to England?

48:02.257 --> 48:04.384
Oh, Lizzy, thank goodness.

48:05.719 --> 48:06.970
Mother, earlier--

48:08.055 --> 48:11.266
You're all right, are you, Mabel? Are you?

48:12.851 --> 48:15.604
- I do want my girls to be all right.
- Yes, very much so.

48:16.230 --> 48:17.981
But Mother, listen. Upstairs--

48:17.981 --> 48:21.860
Now, Mabel, put on your shawl properly,
and that's the end of it.

48:21.860 --> 48:26.156
However will we find you a husband
if you're only ever wearing half a shawl?

49:42.441 --> 49:44.443
<i>So, I take it Nan didn't tell him then?</i>

49:44.443 --> 49:46.361
We still get a duke in the family?

49:53.577 --> 49:57.831
I can't do this anymore, Tracy. It's done.

50:02.461 --> 50:05.547
Do you honestly think anyone would look
at you twice if you're on your own?

50:05.547 --> 50:07.966
Or even open the door to you?

50:08.467 --> 50:10.802
Why, they wouldn't even have you
back in Saratoga, Patti.

50:12.137 --> 50:15.557
And, well, you know
how muddleheaded you get.

50:18.727 --> 50:19.895
You'd never survive.

51:11.530 --> 51:16.201
She asked about her, of course.
Her real mother.

51:20.497 --> 51:21.999
You didn't tell her the truth?

51:22.958 --> 51:26.420
No, of course not. What do you think I am?
