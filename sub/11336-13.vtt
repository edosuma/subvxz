WEBVTT

00:18.252 --> 00:20.219
Ed Lane.

00:20.221 --> 00:22.287
It's Ed Lane I want.

00:22.289 --> 00:24.123
Okay, okay.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.391
Let me start working on that.

00:25.393 --> 00:27.393
(chuckles) Working on that?

00:27.395 --> 00:28.660
Well, yeah, he's out of range.

00:28.662 --> 00:30.295
I got to track him down.

00:30.297 --> 00:32.297
He's standing next to you.

00:39.073 --> 00:41.273
Eight-- is that
enough?
Yep.

00:41.275 --> 00:42.808
You still have Santorini
blue on your hand.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.109
Got to use
the thinner.

00:44.111 --> 00:45.744
Yeah, maybe if you left me some.

00:45.746 --> 00:47.579
I'll bring you
some more tonight.

00:47.581 --> 00:49.348
Flowers, bottle
of thinner.

00:49.350 --> 00:51.250
Instant romance.
Hey, by the way,

00:51.252 --> 00:54.153
it's not Santorini blue;
it's Santorini sky.

00:55.289 --> 00:56.455
Guys done with
the restock?

00:57.425 --> 00:59.191
Yeah.

01:01.462 --> 01:03.195
We're meeting
in the briefing room.

01:03.197 --> 01:04.596
JULES:
Okay.

01:04.598 --> 01:06.265
Jules, how, uh...

01:06.267 --> 01:08.200
how are the renovations coming?

01:09.170 --> 01:10.302
Oh. (chuckles)

01:10.304 --> 01:12.137
Really good: one room left.

01:12.139 --> 01:13.272
A renovation ahead of schedule.

01:13.274 --> 01:14.840
Wow, you getting any help?

01:14.842 --> 01:17.643
No.
Come on.

01:17.645 --> 01:19.178
Your own two hands...
that's amazing.

01:19.180 --> 01:20.212
That's got to feel good.

01:20.214 --> 01:21.547
Yeah, it does.

01:23.784 --> 01:25.551
Okay.

01:44.872 --> 01:48.140
¶ ¶

02:01.755 --> 02:03.355
(beeping)

02:07.661 --> 02:09.628
MAN (over phone):
Hi, it's Luka.
Leave a message.

02:30.518 --> 02:31.884
I'll leave a key for you.

02:31.886 --> 02:33.385
Take anything you want.

02:35.256 --> 02:37.422
I just have one favor to ask.

02:38.459 --> 02:40.626
Look at you.

02:40.628 --> 02:42.594
Got three hours
till vacation.

02:42.596 --> 02:44.263
Someone's already
on the dock

02:44.265 --> 02:46.665
with his fishing rod
and his nice, cold beer.

02:46.667 --> 02:47.799
What?

02:47.801 --> 02:49.268
I'm right here for you, buddy.

02:49.270 --> 02:50.502
You know why?

02:50.504 --> 02:52.204
No "I" in "team."

02:52.206 --> 02:54.273
That's good. You can take
the next crank call,

02:54.275 --> 02:55.774
kick some swatter ass
before you go.

02:55.776 --> 02:57.609
(phone ringing)

02:57.611 --> 02:58.944
Go for Ed.

02:58.946 --> 03:00.179
Go for your beleaguered wife.

03:00.181 --> 03:01.413
Hey, I thought you said

03:01.415 --> 03:02.514
you were gonna pack
your own clothes.

03:02.516 --> 03:03.982
They were wet.

03:03.983 --> 03:05.449
You know that big thing
beside the, uh...

03:05.452 --> 03:06.552
washing machine?

03:06.554 --> 03:08.187
It's called a...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:08.189 --> 03:10.255
Are you gonna pick me up
at noon or what?

03:10.257 --> 03:11.690
Yeah, as soon
as Clark's done music camp.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.292
Hey, where are the fishing rods?

03:13.294 --> 03:14.560
So, they're in the car.

03:14.562 --> 03:15.627
I packed them myself.

03:15.629 --> 03:17.763
Ah, he packs the fun stuff.

03:17.765 --> 03:19.464
You gonna be done shift on time?

03:19.466 --> 03:21.366
Yeah, as long as we don't
get swatted again.

03:21.368 --> 03:23.302
What's that?

03:23.303 --> 03:25.237
We're getting a bunch of 911s
from fake caller IDs.

03:25.239 --> 03:28.674
I just busted in on an old lady
having a cup of tea.

03:28.676 --> 03:30.642
Well, how about this?

03:30.644 --> 03:32.678
You're late, and I'll swat<i> you.</i>

03:32.680 --> 03:33.812
Nice.

03:33.814 --> 03:35.180
Long as you promise to wear

03:35.181 --> 03:36.547
that old lady dress
that I like so much.

03:36.550 --> 03:37.950
Good-bye.

04:00.941 --> 04:03.508
(cat meowing)

04:28.669 --> 04:30.535
PARKER:
Okay, I know
it's been a long day.

04:30.537 --> 04:32.371
It's been a long
ten-day shift.

04:32.373 --> 04:33.772
A few more hours.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.874
Let's just keep it
together, okay?

04:35.876 --> 04:38.610
Now, three swatter calls
in a day.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.579
A little hinky.
WORDY:
Hinky?

04:40.581 --> 04:42.381
Boss, it's starting
to feel personal.

04:42.383 --> 04:43.582
I hear you.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.384
Kira's trying
to do some digging around,

04:45.386 --> 04:47.386
see if she can find a
connection, but in the meantime,

04:47.388 --> 04:48.587
what do we do
if we get another call?

04:48.589 --> 04:50.022
Any suggestions?

04:50.023 --> 04:51.456
If a real call comes in,
we split up.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.458
We don't want to be jammed up
in the wrong end

04:53.460 --> 04:54.526
of the city
chasing our tails, right?

04:54.528 --> 04:55.861
That's good: splinter unit.

04:55.863 --> 04:57.029
Splinter unit
for anything unconfirmed.

04:57.031 --> 04:58.430
Wordy, you're in charge of that.

04:58.432 --> 05:00.299
The two of you
ride along

05:00.301 --> 05:02.000
if it smells like another prank;
the rest of us...

05:02.002 --> 05:03.502
let's stay here
on standby.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.304
Hit the gym, do target practice.

05:05.306 --> 05:07.339
Do something. Let's get it out.

05:07.341 --> 05:09.541
All right.

05:28.495 --> 05:29.561
I have no choice.

05:29.563 --> 05:31.530
This is what war is.

05:31.532 --> 05:33.432
Your father gave me no choice.

05:34.401 --> 05:36.401
That... that's my bus.

05:36.403 --> 05:38.670
I'm sorry for you.

05:38.672 --> 05:41.573
I'm sorry
for everything.

05:41.575 --> 05:43.809
It's terrible to be at war.

05:47.047 --> 05:49.047
Don't blame me.

05:49.049 --> 05:50.916
Blame your father.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.392
So, what
do you guys say?

06:00.394 --> 06:01.493
Parking lot hoops?

06:01.495 --> 06:02.794
Game of 21?
(phone ringing)

06:02.796 --> 06:04.629
When's the last time
you ever got 21?

06:04.631 --> 06:06.665
(laughs)
Afraid of losing
to a family man, huh?

06:06.667 --> 06:08.834
Hey, Clark,
how you doing, buddy?

06:11.472 --> 06:13.038
Look...

06:13.040 --> 06:14.473
Look, slow down, slow down.

06:14.475 --> 06:17.642
Just... no, just start
from the beginning.

06:17.644 --> 06:19.411
Clark?

06:20.848 --> 06:22.514
Boss, I just got
off the phone

06:22.516 --> 06:23.648
with Clark.
What happened?

06:23.650 --> 06:26.385
Some guy came up
to him on the street,

06:26.387 --> 06:28.820
started talking crap about me,
about how this is war.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.689
Don't blame him; blame me.

06:30.691 --> 06:31.823
Hey, sit down.

06:31.825 --> 06:33.058
Sit down.

06:33.994 --> 06:35.160
Is Clark okay?

06:35.162 --> 06:36.161
He's okay.

06:36.163 --> 06:37.562
I'm sure
it's nothing.

06:37.564 --> 06:38.697
But why don't you go anyway.

06:38.699 --> 06:40.031
You sure? I was gonna ask...

06:40.033 --> 06:41.466
Yeah, we're covered.
It's slow.

06:41.468 --> 06:42.667
You're going
on vacation.

06:42.669 --> 06:44.669
You are going
on vacation, right?

06:44.671 --> 06:45.670
I'm going on vacation, yeah.

06:45.672 --> 06:46.772
So, go see
your son.

06:46.774 --> 06:48.673
Get out of town
before the traffic hits.

06:48.675 --> 06:49.574
All right, be safe.

06:49.576 --> 06:50.575
I'll see you.

06:50.577 --> 06:51.843
All right,
have fun.

06:52.813 --> 06:53.879
Think he knows?

06:53.881 --> 06:54.980
Who?

06:54.982 --> 06:57.682
Sarge.

06:57.684 --> 06:59.551
Yes, I think
he knows.

06:59.553 --> 07:00.786
Ow... why?

07:00.788 --> 07:02.988
You have blue paint
on your ear.

07:02.990 --> 07:05.690
(sighs)

07:07.628 --> 07:09.494
Well, we might as well
just tell him now.

07:09.496 --> 07:10.695
Get it over with.

07:10.697 --> 07:12.197
I'll do it. I don't care.

07:12.199 --> 07:13.866
Yeah, and then what?

07:13.867 --> 07:15.534
One of us gets transferred
to another team?

07:15.536 --> 07:18.036
These guys are my family.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.671
Not just yours.

07:24.144 --> 07:26.812
Doesn't mean I want
to give you up.

07:28.215 --> 07:29.815
Jules...

07:29.817 --> 07:31.116
What?

07:31.118 --> 07:35.487
KIRA (over PA):
Team 1, hot call
at Nathan Phillips Square.

07:35.489 --> 07:36.621
Repeat: hot call.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.156
(alarm blaring)

07:38.158 --> 07:39.591
That's City Hall, boss.

07:39.593 --> 07:40.725
I hear it... Kira?

07:40.727 --> 07:42.461
KIRA:
Reports
of shots fired.

07:42.463 --> 07:43.995
Multiple witnesses.

07:43.997 --> 07:46.097
Not a prank?
No, sir.

07:46.099 --> 07:47.699
I've got Inspector Stainton
on the line.

07:47.701 --> 07:49.734
Let's see what's going on.

07:49.736 --> 07:50.936
Inspector?

07:50.938 --> 07:53.738
Sergeant, we got
one serious situation here.

07:53.740 --> 07:54.973
Tell me.

07:54.974 --> 07:56.207
One injured:
City Hall security guard's

07:56.210 --> 07:57.476
been shot in the leg,

07:57.478 --> 07:58.710
and we're pinned in here
real bad.

07:58.712 --> 08:00.479
How many shots fired?

08:00.481 --> 08:02.714
Three, four... they're coming
every two minutes.

08:02.716 --> 08:04.716
Honest to God, we don't know
where they're coming from.

08:04.718 --> 08:06.651
You clear all the civilians,
four-block radius?

08:06.653 --> 08:08.186
We're doing the best we can.

08:08.188 --> 08:09.754
It's summertime in the city.

08:09.756 --> 08:11.523
(gunfire, people screaming)

08:11.525 --> 08:12.757
Greg.

08:12.759 --> 08:14.793
(gunfire, screaming continue)

08:17.631 --> 08:18.697
Okay, we'll be right there.

08:18.699 --> 08:19.764
Containment is the priority.

08:19.766 --> 08:21.032
I'll call you back in three.

08:21.034 --> 08:22.767
Kira, call Team 4.

08:22.769 --> 08:23.768
All hands on deck. Eddie?

08:23.770 --> 08:24.970
WORDY:
Trucks are loaded.

08:24.972 --> 08:27.606
Okay, boys,
let's keep the peace.

08:27.608 --> 08:31.676
  Captioning sponsored by
  CBS

09:05.312 --> 09:07.846
(sirens wailing in distance)

09:14.688 --> 09:17.756
(sirens blaring)

09:24.798 --> 09:26.631
Keep it close
to the car.

09:26.633 --> 09:28.333
Let's get
some shields.

09:29.603 --> 09:31.136
Heads down.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.172
WORDY:
They're pinned behind the car.

09:36.944 --> 09:39.110
How is the victim doing,
Inspector?

09:39.112 --> 09:40.145
He's holding on.

09:40.147 --> 09:42.881
Sam, Louis, Wordy.

09:42.883 --> 09:44.883
Let's give him some cover.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.017
Get him inside

09:46.019 --> 09:47.352
so the EMT can get to him.

09:54.895 --> 09:56.661
It's been a nightmare;
we got no idea

09:56.663 --> 09:58.163
where these shots
are coming from.

09:58.165 --> 09:59.631
And how are we doing
on containment?

09:59.633 --> 10:00.732
We've evacuated
all civilians

10:00.734 --> 10:01.766
into the underground lots,

10:01.768 --> 10:03.368
but you got people
coming in and out

10:03.370 --> 10:05.337
of all these buildings.

10:18.685 --> 10:19.718
(gun firing)

10:19.720 --> 10:20.819
Ooh.

10:20.821 --> 10:21.920
Shooter's active.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.388
Like clockwork,
every two minutes.

10:23.390 --> 10:24.923
Lou?
I'm on it.

10:24.925 --> 10:26.691
Acoustic locator's
gonna nail his position

10:26.693 --> 10:28.059
as soon as he shoots again.

10:28.061 --> 10:31.062
¶ ¶

11:00.894 --> 11:02.794
Beyond the security guard,
there's no other injuries.

11:02.796 --> 11:04.262
Thank God
this guy's not a pro.

11:04.264 --> 11:05.997
Wordy, you get a look
at the wound.
Yeah.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.699
The exit wound's lower
than the entry.

11:07.701 --> 11:09.334
Means he's shooting
from up top.

11:09.336 --> 11:10.368
PARKER:
Okay, it's

11:10.370 --> 11:11.403
a target-rich environment

11:11.405 --> 11:12.704
that's almost uncontainable.

11:12.706 --> 11:14.039
I got no one to talk down.

11:14.041 --> 11:15.206
Any word from counterterrorism?

11:15.208 --> 11:16.241
No, I'm telling you,
no chatter,

11:16.243 --> 11:17.275
no warning, no nothing.

11:17.277 --> 11:18.309
This guy's come
from of nowhere.

11:18.311 --> 11:19.344
Okay, Spike,
you stay

11:19.346 --> 11:20.729
in the Command Truck.

11:20.730 --> 11:22.113
You run all the maps
and the intelligence,

11:22.115 --> 11:23.448
all information flows
through you.

11:23.450 --> 11:25.684
Copy.

11:25.686 --> 11:28.687
Okay, I'm looking
at 300-meter radius on the 3-D.

11:28.689 --> 11:30.021
Buildings are dense.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.190
Lots of places he can be,
lots of angles.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.192
We got to try to narrow it down.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.027
Find out where the shots
are coming from.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.962
Locaters are online,
so we got ears.

11:37.964 --> 11:40.331
Let's see
if we can get any clues.

11:40.333 --> 11:41.399
Louis, Wordy.

11:41.401 --> 11:43.001
We'll do witnesses.
All right,

11:43.003 --> 11:44.335
you press them for details.

11:44.337 --> 11:46.337
I need to know where
that shot came from.

11:46.339 --> 11:47.305
Copy.
JULES:
The way the
victim fell,

11:47.307 --> 11:48.907
did he spin,
did he crumple?

11:48.909 --> 11:50.375
Any visible shimmers,

11:50.377 --> 11:52.377
muzzle flashes,
reflection, movement.

11:52.379 --> 11:54.045
ED:
Sam, Jules,

11:54.047 --> 11:55.480
let's break it down.
Came from the south.

11:55.482 --> 11:57.482
We got a lot of options here.
Where would you go?

11:57.484 --> 12:00.218
Clock tower, classic,
lots of shadows,

12:00.220 --> 12:02.153
good concealment.

12:02.155 --> 12:03.922
Building under construction,

12:03.924 --> 12:05.290
lots of visual
distraction...

12:05.292 --> 12:07.325
(gunshot)

12:07.327 --> 12:08.293
PARKER:
Whoa, whoa.

12:08.295 --> 12:10.212
Buddy must be lucky

12:10.213 --> 12:12.130
or he knows what
a sniper locator looks like.

12:12.132 --> 12:13.798
He's located himself.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.266
Ricochet directly through

12:15.268 --> 12:17.001
the target

12:17.003 --> 12:18.269
to the point of origin.

12:18.271 --> 12:19.437
The hotel.

12:19.439 --> 12:20.505
SAM:
Could be the roof.

12:20.507 --> 12:22.140
JULES:
Any of those
top floors.

12:22.142 --> 12:23.374
A lot of tinted
windows.

12:23.376 --> 12:25.310
Let's start with the roof.

12:25.312 --> 12:27.312
ED:
Active shooter,

12:27.314 --> 12:29.180
we go to him.
Okay.

12:29.182 --> 12:32.250
I'm gonna brief the Chief.
I'll be in the truck.

12:34.287 --> 12:38.089
All right, use the overhang
for cover.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.125
How many seconds
from his last shot?

12:40.127 --> 12:41.326
JULES:
60 seconds.

12:41.328 --> 12:43.027
Sam, grab a shield. Let's go.

12:43.029 --> 12:44.829
Go! Go! I'm going
to cover you.

12:44.831 --> 12:46.531
If you don't think
you can make it,

12:46.533 --> 12:48.233
wait till he fires again.

12:48.235 --> 12:50.235
Copy that.

12:50.237 --> 12:52.170
Spike, count us down.

12:52.172 --> 12:54.205
Ten, nine,

12:54.207 --> 12:57.075
eight, seven, six,

12:57.077 --> 13:00.078
five, four, three,

13:00.080 --> 13:02.213
two, one.

13:04.317 --> 13:05.550
Two minutes, right?

13:05.552 --> 13:07.485
Copy. Over two minutes now.

13:08.522 --> 13:10.421
All right, he's breaking
his pattern.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.259
Maybe we're
getting warm.

13:14.261 --> 13:15.493
Or he's moved.

13:15.495 --> 13:17.428
Where would you go next,
it was you?

13:17.430 --> 13:18.463
Clock tower's

13:18.465 --> 13:20.465
a no-brainer.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.467
Right there.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.536
All those vents, visual
distractions, clean view

13:24.538 --> 13:26.004
of the square, boss.

13:26.006 --> 13:27.272
Okay, see it.

13:27.274 --> 13:29.107
Inspector?
Yeah?

13:29.109 --> 13:31.176
Clock tower--

13:31.178 --> 13:33.478
lock up the whole
southeast quadrant.

13:33.480 --> 13:37.348
Copy that.

13:37.350 --> 13:39.484
PARKER:
<i> No one in</i>

13:39.486 --> 13:41.319
or out. SRU only.
Done.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.822
We got a chopper coming in
to sweep the rooftops.

13:43.824 --> 13:45.356
You want a long-range,
precision weapon

13:45.358 --> 13:47.258
against a big
noisy target?

13:47.260 --> 13:48.560
I'll call it off.

13:48.562 --> 13:50.161
Thanks.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.396
Sam, Jules?

13:51.398 --> 13:54.265
Almost there.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.434
Somebody opened
those doors.

13:56.436 --> 13:58.937
ED:
We're thinking he's moved,

13:58.939 --> 14:00.939
but if he hasn't,

14:00.941 --> 14:03.441
you're looking at booby traps,

14:03.443 --> 14:05.476
ambush, suicide,

14:05.478 --> 14:07.512
suicide by cop.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.514
Maximum caution.

14:09.516 --> 14:12.517
Our friend hit a seven-inch
target from 400 meters.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.956
JULES:
Roof's clear.
He's not up here.

14:19.926 --> 14:21.993
But he was.

14:26.933 --> 14:29.400
It's a .762. Carbon Striations.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.402
He's got an HK G3.

14:31.404 --> 14:33.238
That's nasty.
Shields are safe,

14:33.240 --> 14:35.240
but that'll crack body armor.

14:35.242 --> 14:37.609
This hotel has 43 floors.

14:37.611 --> 14:38.977
ED:
<i> Stainton's</i>

14:38.979 --> 14:41.012
got uniforms sweeping
the interiors.

14:41.014 --> 14:43.214
The rooftops are up to us.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.250
Clock tower's next.

14:45.252 --> 14:47.318
Copy that.

14:49.222 --> 14:52.090
Wordy, Louis, any luck
with the witnesses?

14:52.092 --> 14:53.324
You haven't seen anything,
have you?

14:53.326 --> 14:54.459
Nothing we don't
already know.

14:54.461 --> 14:56.261
All right, move on.

14:56.263 --> 14:58.062
Next highest building,
City Hall,

14:58.064 --> 14:59.564
both rooftops.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.532
Copy that.
On our way.

15:01.534 --> 15:05.303
Spike, get forensics up
to the hotel roof.

15:05.305 --> 15:07.305
Right now we're doing
everything we can.

15:07.307 --> 15:09.307
Yes, sir.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.142
Every step of the way.

15:11.144 --> 15:13.177
Yeah. Bye.

15:13.179 --> 15:15.246
Hey, way to start
your vacation.

15:21.354 --> 15:22.654
Team 3,
I need access.

15:22.656 --> 15:24.923
We kept the elevator
open for you.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.030
What a scene, huh?

15:32.032 --> 15:33.531
I don't get it.
I really don't.

15:33.533 --> 15:35.667
What kind of a person would
do something like that?

15:38.972 --> 15:41.005
Thank you.

15:41.007 --> 15:44.042
Good luck.

16:02.162 --> 16:03.995
Tactically?

16:03.997 --> 16:05.530
We can't do anything
until...

16:05.532 --> 16:06.597
Until he starts
shooting again.

16:06.599 --> 16:08.633
Okay, so help me out.
Who is this guy?

16:08.635 --> 16:09.600
Criminal sharpshooter.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.636
I mean, usually, it's military

16:11.638 --> 16:14.172
or law enforcement...
Yeah, but this guy doesn't seem
to be hitting his mark.

16:14.174 --> 16:16.358
He's trying hard
not to, right?

16:16.359 --> 16:18.543
A dozen shots, only one injury,
what are the odds, right?

16:18.545 --> 16:20.645
Hit the locator pretty good.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.647
Okay, let's assume
he knows what he's doing.

16:22.649 --> 16:23.548
Typical profile?

16:23.550 --> 16:24.582
Tyrannical sadist.

16:24.584 --> 16:26.684
Antisocial,
wants to play God,

16:26.686 --> 16:29.153
wants control, wants to see
innocent people suffer.

16:29.155 --> 16:30.989
Except...
Except there's
only one injury,

16:30.991 --> 16:32.623
not much
of a sadist.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.592
Maybe it's targeted.
Maybe it's revenge.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.194
Maybe it's...
maybe it's personal.

16:36.196 --> 16:38.229
That's what Wordy said in
the briefing room, right?

16:38.231 --> 16:39.597
"Feels like it's personal."

16:39.599 --> 16:41.265
Three swatter calls, one shift.

16:41.267 --> 16:42.533
That's a first.

16:42.535 --> 16:43.568
This guy's trying
to wear us out.

16:43.570 --> 16:45.553
It's urban warfare strategy.

16:45.554 --> 16:47.537
You hit the army when they're
tired returning from battle.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.173
All right, I'm going
to check with Kira,

16:49.175 --> 16:50.641
see if she tracked down
those swatter calls.

16:50.643 --> 16:52.510
Sam, Jules.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.512
Uniforms are sweeping the hotel.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.581
We're heading
to the clock tower.

16:58.651 --> 17:01.686
Kira forwarded the sound files
from 911 calls this morning.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.388
They come from different
phone numbers?

17:03.390 --> 17:05.089
Yeah, but it sounds
like spoofing to me.

17:05.091 --> 17:07.091
Spoofing?
Seems it's perfectly legal

17:07.093 --> 17:08.726
to impersonate
another caller ID

17:08.728 --> 17:11.229
if it's "for entertainment
purposes only."

17:11.231 --> 17:14.165
MAN:
Oh, my God, he's going
to shoot me!

17:14.167 --> 17:16.167
They guarantee privacy.

17:16.169 --> 17:18.569
They don't release
clients' names.

17:18.571 --> 17:21.039
It's my friend. He says
he's going to shoot himself.

17:21.041 --> 17:22.206
For a little extra

17:22.208 --> 17:23.641
they'll mess with the pitch
of your voice.

17:23.643 --> 17:26.444
Help, please, put the gun down!

17:26.446 --> 17:27.478
You hear that?

17:27.480 --> 17:29.147
Three voices, one accent.

17:29.149 --> 17:30.615
Eastern European?

17:30.617 --> 17:32.150
Ed.

17:32.152 --> 17:33.317
Personal.

17:33.319 --> 17:35.153
First York.
No way.

17:35.155 --> 17:36.788
No choice. "It's not me,

17:36.790 --> 17:38.589
it's your father.
This is war."

17:38.591 --> 17:40.258
How did Clark describe the guy

17:40.260 --> 17:41.492
at the bus stop today?
Yeah,

17:41.494 --> 17:43.494
Eddie.
European accent. Young guy.

17:43.496 --> 17:45.329
No way.

17:45.331 --> 17:47.131
Call your
family.
All right.

17:47.133 --> 17:48.299
Team, listen up,

17:48.301 --> 17:50.668
We think we know
who this guy is.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.207
ED:
Okay, Clark? You did the right
thing staying at school.

17:56.209 --> 17:57.475
Just sit tight, buddy.

17:57.477 --> 17:59.210
Sit tight till Mom gets there.

17:59.212 --> 18:01.279
Okay, I love you, too.

18:02.682 --> 18:05.716
Kira, get my wife and kid to the
station and lock down the SRU.

18:07.353 --> 18:09.754
Okay, mid-20s, dark hair,
ordinary-looking.

18:09.756 --> 18:11.222
Spoke with an accent.

18:11.224 --> 18:12.256
I know.

18:12.258 --> 18:13.524
You shot his father.

18:13.526 --> 18:15.193
He was close enough
to feel the bullet fly.

18:15.195 --> 18:16.627
He took me to court
for wrongful death.

18:16.629 --> 18:17.662
And he lost.

18:17.664 --> 18:18.663
Yeah.
Okay.

18:18.665 --> 18:20.248
Kira, Spike,

18:20.249 --> 18:21.832
I need you to pull up
a wrongful death lawsuit.

18:21.835 --> 18:23.134
Last name: Tomasic.

18:23.136 --> 18:24.469
Copy that.

18:24.471 --> 18:26.204
I'm also sending out
a photograph of the subject.

18:26.206 --> 18:31.242
News footage of First York.

18:37.717 --> 18:40.585
Boss, I've got
his employment records.

18:40.587 --> 18:41.719
PARKER:
Next of kin?

18:41.721 --> 18:43.588
Goran Tomasic.

18:43.590 --> 18:45.156
That's his father.
He's deceased.

18:45.158 --> 18:46.591
Any emergency contacts?

18:46.593 --> 18:48.192
Luka Boblic.

18:48.194 --> 18:49.560
Here, I got a cell number.

18:49.562 --> 18:51.562
Okay, let's get that guy here
immediately.

18:51.564 --> 18:52.663
Let's send a squad car.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.665
Guys, what are
we doing here?

18:54.667 --> 18:56.400
ED:
We've ID'd the subject.

18:56.402 --> 18:57.502
We're looking for him.

18:57.504 --> 18:58.703
He's camouflaged,
or he's hiding.

18:58.705 --> 19:00.688
And what's the next step?

19:00.689 --> 19:02.672
We get in his head;
we anticipate his next move.

19:02.675 --> 19:03.808
Until then...

19:03.810 --> 19:05.476
wait till he shoots again.

19:05.478 --> 19:06.677
Terrific.

19:06.679 --> 19:08.379
Uniforms have locked down
the entrances

19:08.381 --> 19:10.381
to the south buildings.

19:10.382 --> 19:12.382
Wordy, Lou, how you guys doing
on the City Hall towers?

19:12.385 --> 19:14.552
Rooftops are clear.

19:14.554 --> 19:16.320
Going to the
mechanical room.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.022
Where are you?

19:18.023 --> 19:19.723
SOPHIE:
Just looking for my tennis
racket. You almost ready?

19:19.726 --> 19:21.292
Listen, there's a squad car
going to come by.

19:21.294 --> 19:22.460
It's going to pick you up.

19:22.462 --> 19:24.195
A squad car?

19:24.197 --> 19:25.363
Why?

19:25.365 --> 19:26.697
Sophie, it's just
a precaution, okay?

19:26.699 --> 19:28.699
I'm sorry.

19:28.701 --> 19:30.701
I'll explain as soon as I can.

19:30.703 --> 19:32.803
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

19:32.805 --> 19:34.305
I love you.

19:34.307 --> 19:36.574
I love you, too.

19:36.576 --> 19:39.744
We got to find this guy now.

19:39.746 --> 19:41.879
Yeah, Spike found
a photo.

19:41.881 --> 19:43.881
The guy's name is Petar Tomasic.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.650
Quit his job two weeks ago,

19:45.652 --> 19:47.718
and no one's answering the phone
at his apartment.

19:50.356 --> 19:52.623
Guys, subject is confirmed.

19:52.625 --> 19:55.660
Petar Tomasic. 26 year-old,
Caucasian, dark hair.

19:55.662 --> 19:57.795
Sam, Jules, where are you?

19:57.797 --> 19:59.330
We're heading up
the clock tower.

19:59.332 --> 20:00.865
JULES:
Sweeping floor
by floor.

20:00.867 --> 20:02.833
JULES:
Nothing here, Ed.

20:02.835 --> 20:03.868
ED:
Copy.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.870
Sam, Wordy, Louis,
what's your 20?

20:05.872 --> 20:07.872
Clearing the mechanical room.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.941
Heading to the East Tower.

20:10.977 --> 20:12.677
All right, keep talking to us.

20:12.679 --> 20:14.679
Eddie, Luka Boblic is here.

20:14.681 --> 20:15.813
He was on scene.

20:15.815 --> 20:17.882
You might want
to listen in.

20:19.686 --> 20:22.720
Luka, this is Ed Lane.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.822
I know who you are.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.557
You know why you're here?

20:26.559 --> 20:27.858
Petar left a message
on my phone.

20:27.860 --> 20:29.694
I heard on the radio
what was happening.

20:29.696 --> 20:31.329
I came down as fast as I could.

20:31.331 --> 20:32.563
No one would let me through.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.765
Petar left a message?

20:34.767 --> 20:36.567
He said, uh, good-bye.

20:36.569 --> 20:40.538
I knew something was coming.

20:40.540 --> 20:41.839
Where is he?

20:41.841 --> 20:43.791
That's just it;
we don't know.

20:43.792 --> 20:45.742
So, let's start
with the basics, okay?

20:45.745 --> 20:48.879
Does Petar have access to a gun?

20:48.881 --> 20:52.283
I-I don't know.

20:52.285 --> 20:56.020
Last week he told me he was
thinking about getting a rifle

20:56.022 --> 20:58.256
from some guy,
black market.

20:58.258 --> 20:59.490
I don't know who.

20:59.492 --> 21:02.360
When I heard that, I said,

21:02.362 --> 21:04.895
"Petar, you do this, I swear,
I'll turn you in myself."

21:07.600 --> 21:11.402
He told me to forget it.
He was just kidding.

21:11.404 --> 21:13.804
I believed him.

21:13.806 --> 21:14.839
I believed him.

21:14.841 --> 21:16.540
This isn't your fault, Luka.

21:16.542 --> 21:18.809
Okay, he made his
own choice here today.

21:18.811 --> 21:20.044
But you can still help him.

21:20.046 --> 21:22.680
He was...

21:22.682 --> 21:27.752
so angry
at everything, everyone.

21:27.754 --> 21:29.520
He thinks you ruined his life.

21:30.490 --> 21:32.423
Did he say what kind of rifle
it was?

21:32.425 --> 21:33.758
I don't know.

21:33.760 --> 21:37.728
Does he know how to shoot it?

21:37.730 --> 21:40.064
Does your friend know
how to shoot a rifle?

21:43.603 --> 21:46.804
Snipers were how
we protected ourselves.

21:46.806 --> 21:49.340
Petar shot eight men dead
before he was 16.

21:49.342 --> 21:52.543
Croatia, it was
a civil war, sir.

21:52.545 --> 21:56.881
Petar Tomasic was one of the
best snipers in our country.

21:57.850 --> 22:00.851
We were like
brothers; we were

22:00.853 --> 22:02.320
little kids together;
we grew up together.

22:02.322 --> 22:03.454
So, what happened?

22:03.456 --> 22:05.356
Petar got recruited
by the local militia.

22:05.358 --> 22:07.792
He fought alongside his father
against the Serbs.

22:07.794 --> 22:10.328
Everyone called him
"Mali Sniperist"--

22:10.330 --> 22:12.029
"Baby Sniper."

22:12.031 --> 22:13.864
He protected our village.

22:13.866 --> 22:17.101
Subject is a skilled sniper,
familiar with urban warfare.

22:17.103 --> 22:20.871
If he was missing his mark,
he was missing it on purpose.

22:20.873 --> 22:23.107
Guys, this is a
revenge situation.

22:23.109 --> 22:25.976
Good news:
We've narrowed it down.

22:25.978 --> 22:27.978
He's looking for me.

22:27.980 --> 22:30.981
I killed his father
at First York Plaza.

22:34.487 --> 22:35.886
Two years, I was at school,

22:35.888 --> 22:38.356
he was hiding in the hills,
fighting our enemies.

22:38.358 --> 22:40.991
Until they found out who he was.

22:40.993 --> 22:42.993
They didn't come after him.

22:42.995 --> 22:44.895
They came after his family.

22:44.897 --> 22:48.999
They tortured his mother
and they killed her and...

22:49.001 --> 22:50.901
And he nearly went crazy.

22:50.903 --> 22:52.470
But his father saved him.

22:52.472 --> 22:54.538
They escaped through
two countries on foot.

22:54.540 --> 22:56.674
So, the woman that,
um, that was shot

22:56.676 --> 22:57.942
at First York?

22:57.944 --> 22:58.943
His stepmother.

22:58.945 --> 23:00.644
KIRA:
Boss?

23:00.646 --> 23:02.480
Yeah, Kira.

23:02.482 --> 23:03.814
You were right.

23:03.816 --> 23:05.649
Spoofing network confirmed
all three 911s

23:05.651 --> 23:07.618
were routed through them
from the same client.

23:07.620 --> 23:09.053
But they don't want to release
the client's name

23:09.055 --> 23:10.588
without a subpoena.

23:10.590 --> 23:12.022
Want me to play bad cop on them?

23:12.024 --> 23:13.424
No, thanks, Kira.

23:13.426 --> 23:15.493
I think we may have
what we need right here.

23:15.495 --> 23:16.894
Copy that.

23:16.896 --> 23:18.462
Luka, if we can talk to him,

23:18.464 --> 23:21.399
we may be able to stop him
from harming anybody else.

23:21.401 --> 23:22.600
I know his cell number.

23:23.569 --> 23:25.436
Thank you.

23:33.513 --> 23:36.580
(phone ringing)

23:46.426 --> 23:49.126
Petar Tomasic?

23:49.128 --> 23:53.197
Petar, it's Greg Parker with the
Police Strategic Response Unit.

23:53.199 --> 23:55.132
Thank you very much
for picking up.

23:56.903 --> 23:59.036
Petar?

23:59.038 --> 24:01.038
Petar, I think it's important
that we start talking.

24:01.040 --> 24:02.473
Why?

24:04.076 --> 24:05.576
Maybe I can help you

24:05.578 --> 24:07.912
if I can understand
what you're looking for.

24:07.914 --> 24:09.580
I know what I'm looking for.

24:09.582 --> 24:10.781
Oh, yeah?

24:10.783 --> 24:11.916
Ed Lane.

24:11.918 --> 24:14.685
It's Ed Lane I want.

24:14.687 --> 24:17.521
Okay, okay, let me
start working on that.

24:17.523 --> 24:18.956
(chuckling):
Working on that?

24:18.958 --> 24:20.658
Well, yeah, he's out of range.

24:20.660 --> 24:22.960
I got to track him down.

24:22.962 --> 24:25.663
He's standing next to you.

24:28.868 --> 24:31.101
I guess you can see everything,
huh, Petar?

24:31.103 --> 24:32.470
Like you.

24:32.472 --> 24:33.771
You can hear everything.

24:33.773 --> 24:36.507
You can see everything.

24:36.509 --> 24:38.075
Almost.

24:41.113 --> 24:42.847
What do you mean?
What does that mean?

24:53.159 --> 24:55.860
Officer down!
Officer down!

24:55.862 --> 24:58.963
Well, we waited till he shot
again, didn't we, Sergeant?

24:58.965 --> 25:00.498
That kid was 24
years of age.

25:00.500 --> 25:01.832
Fresh out of police academy.

25:01.834 --> 25:03.033
You tell me how
we could've prevented that!

25:03.035 --> 25:04.201
You tell me!

25:04.203 --> 25:05.603
You want to call
the Chief on this?

25:05.605 --> 25:07.037
You call him,
you explain it!

25:07.039 --> 25:09.707
No, no, I want to
settle this thing.

25:09.709 --> 25:12.076
Confirm Team 4 is containing
east buildings.

25:12.078 --> 25:13.711
Can't tell where
the sound came from.

25:13.713 --> 25:15.179
Could be any building
in this range.

25:15.181 --> 25:16.881
He's using these curved walls.

25:16.883 --> 25:19.683
Refracting the sound,
he's covering his tracks.

25:19.685 --> 25:20.818
He's in the vicinity.

25:20.820 --> 25:21.919
He's accelerating
to get a response

25:21.921 --> 25:23.587
and he's targeting
law enforcement.

25:23.589 --> 25:25.856
He can see me
and he's trying to draw me out.

25:25.858 --> 25:27.475
Boss, if you get him
back on the phone,

25:27.476 --> 25:29.093
keep him on it;
I can try tracking his position.

25:29.095 --> 25:31.161
Copy that.

25:33.266 --> 25:34.965
Knew my dad was a cop, right?

25:34.967 --> 25:36.200
I thought he was a farmer.

25:36.202 --> 25:39.136
Yeah, well, before that
he was a cop.

25:39.138 --> 25:40.905
Remember the Tower Sniper?

25:40.907 --> 25:43.274
Yeah, 40 years ago,
guy in a clock tower?

25:43.276 --> 25:45.276
He killed 16 people that day.

25:45.278 --> 25:47.211
Cops couldn't get to him.

25:47.213 --> 25:49.813
They didn't have the tools
or the training.

25:49.815 --> 25:51.248
When it was all over with,

25:51.250 --> 25:53.851
they decided they were
gonna do something about it.

25:54.787 --> 25:55.953
You're kidding.

25:55.955 --> 25:57.555
Your dad was part
of the first SWAT teams?

25:57.557 --> 26:01.258
No, he was one of the cops
that couldn't do anything.

26:01.260 --> 26:03.294
He bought a farm
in the prairies

26:03.296 --> 26:05.829
and raised me and my brothers
away from it all.

26:05.831 --> 26:08.232
So, I guess he wasn't exactly
thrilled that you became a cop.

26:09.201 --> 26:11.268
We got to get this guy.

26:13.072 --> 26:15.406
You know what?
He's not answering.

26:15.407 --> 26:17.741
Luka, you mind calling him
on your own phone?
No.

26:17.743 --> 26:20.244
Boss, boss, the subject's
already volatile.

26:20.246 --> 26:22.313
You sure we want to bring
in a third party now?

26:22.315 --> 26:23.681
Yeah, we're out of time.

26:23.683 --> 26:25.349
And you think the kid
can talk to him?

26:25.351 --> 26:27.151
No, but he can keep him
on the line long enough

26:27.153 --> 26:28.852
for Spike to get a lock
on where he is.

26:28.854 --> 26:30.154
Okay.
Luka...

26:30.156 --> 26:32.039
Luka, if you get him talking,

26:32.040 --> 26:33.923
think past his plan
to the bigger picture.

26:33.926 --> 26:35.926
You said you were
like brothers, right?
Right.

26:35.928 --> 26:37.294
ED:
Team, we're bringing in a TPI.

26:37.296 --> 26:38.629
Put it on speaker.

26:38.631 --> 26:40.230
Spike, I'm coming in.

26:41.133 --> 26:44.134
(phone ringing)

26:46.939 --> 26:48.739
Petar.

26:51.677 --> 26:55.179
(speaking foreign language)

26:55.181 --> 26:57.314
English.

26:57.316 --> 26:58.983
What good is this going to do?

26:58.985 --> 27:00.718
You know what they did.

27:00.720 --> 27:02.252
You know what I have to do.

27:02.254 --> 27:05.789
He promised me it'd be
different here, but it's not.

27:06.759 --> 27:08.626
Come on. Come on.

27:20.172 --> 27:23.807
I got used to not being afraid.

27:26.846 --> 27:30.381
You don't need to be afraid.

27:30.383 --> 27:32.316
They told me
no one will be hurt.

27:34.420 --> 27:37.721
That's what they said
before he shot my father.

27:39.692 --> 27:42.092
Tell them I want Ed Lane
to come out.

27:42.094 --> 27:44.094
Or more people will die!

27:45.731 --> 27:47.798
Petar!

27:48.734 --> 27:49.900
Phone's dead.

27:49.902 --> 27:51.335
Doesn't matter. I got it.

27:51.337 --> 27:52.670
Where?

27:52.672 --> 27:54.138
Right there.

27:54.140 --> 27:55.305
He's on the roof.

27:55.307 --> 27:56.273
That was locked down.

27:56.275 --> 27:57.941
How'd he get in?

27:57.943 --> 28:00.177
Jules, Wordy, meet me at the
southeast corner, Bay and Queen.

28:00.179 --> 28:02.212
Copy.

28:02.214 --> 28:04.915
On our way.

28:04.917 --> 28:07.084
Let's stop this guy
before he shoots somebody else.

28:07.086 --> 28:08.819
Eddie, you're the target.
You're not going anywhere.

28:08.821 --> 28:10.320
You're staying covered
right here, okay.

28:10.322 --> 28:11.955
You can act as spotter
from the ground.

28:11.957 --> 28:13.957
Boss...
That's an order.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.360
Team, report in.

28:16.362 --> 28:18.429
Leaving City Hall.

28:20.232 --> 28:22.833
There's an employee entrance.

28:22.835 --> 28:25.002
Let's do this fast
before he shoots again.

28:25.004 --> 28:27.071
We kept the freight elevator
open for you guys.

28:31.110 --> 28:33.210
Stairwell's been blocked off.
No one's been up or down?

28:33.212 --> 28:34.244
Not since we locked it up.

28:34.246 --> 28:35.779
One SRU officer, that's it.

28:35.781 --> 28:37.381
One SRU officer?

28:37.383 --> 28:38.949
Alone?
Yeah.

28:38.951 --> 28:40.017
From Team 3.

28:41.854 --> 28:42.886
Thanks.

28:42.888 --> 28:44.488
Hey, Ed, Team 3 on the scene?

28:44.490 --> 28:46.457
Negative. Team 4. Why?

28:46.459 --> 28:48.292
Copper said an SRU
went up to the roof.

28:48.294 --> 28:49.359
Solo.

28:49.361 --> 28:50.928
He said he was Team 3.

28:50.930 --> 28:53.097
Jules...

28:53.099 --> 28:55.165
Yeah, I know.

28:56.936 --> 28:58.435
Spike, put out an APB.

28:58.437 --> 29:00.938
Subject may be wearing
an SRU uniform or a mockup

29:00.940 --> 29:02.773
identifying himself as Team 3.

29:02.775 --> 29:04.875
We got reports
that SRU entered building

29:04.877 --> 29:06.343
southwest corner, Bay and Queen.

29:06.345 --> 29:08.479
We're accounted for.
Team 4's accounted for.

29:08.481 --> 29:12.249
Is there anything else
you can tell us, Luka?

29:12.251 --> 29:13.917
Anything at all?

29:13.919 --> 29:16.487
He's not a bad person.

29:16.489 --> 29:17.855
He's not.

29:17.857 --> 29:20.491
He got a job.
He tried to fit in,

29:20.493 --> 29:23.327
but when his father was killed
right in front of him...

29:23.329 --> 29:26.263
I wanted to help him.

29:26.265 --> 29:27.765
The lawsuit--

29:27.767 --> 29:29.366
it was useless, expensive.

29:29.368 --> 29:31.301
It just made it worse.

29:31.303 --> 29:32.936
He got more angry,
more bitter.

29:32.938 --> 29:34.271
It was...

29:34.273 --> 29:36.240
It was terrible to watch.

29:37.810 --> 29:39.076
Ed, we're at the roof.

29:39.078 --> 29:40.477
We're ready to move in.

29:45.050 --> 29:46.817
Northwest corner
by the air vent.

29:46.819 --> 29:47.985
Looks like a rifle barrel.

29:47.987 --> 29:50.053
Copy.

29:51.123 --> 29:53.357
(door creaking)

29:53.359 --> 29:55.058
Guys, they're going in.

29:55.060 --> 29:56.360
Boss?

29:56.362 --> 29:58.362
Yeah, I'm on my way.

29:59.365 --> 30:00.798
Lou, Wordy?

30:00.800 --> 30:02.866
Almost there.

30:04.270 --> 30:06.336
Thanks.

30:13.379 --> 30:15.946
He's not moving.

30:15.948 --> 30:17.114
Low and slow.

30:17.116 --> 30:19.266
Copy.

30:19.267 --> 30:21.417
He shot himself.
Any signs of trauma?

30:21.420 --> 30:23.453
SAM:
It's hard to tell.
I think we got him.

30:26.192 --> 30:27.958
Police, drop your weapon!

30:27.960 --> 30:30.093
Hands in the air
or we will shoot!

30:30.095 --> 30:31.361
Show me your hands!
Show me your hands!

30:31.363 --> 30:33.096
Show me your hands!

30:33.098 --> 30:34.932
It's a decoy!

30:34.934 --> 30:35.866
Where is he?

30:35.868 --> 30:37.501
ED:
It's a decoy. Fall back.

30:37.503 --> 30:39.036
Fall back now! Take cover!

30:39.038 --> 30:40.137
(gunshot)

30:44.143 --> 30:45.542
(gasps)

30:50.282 --> 30:52.182
Officer down! Officer down!

30:52.184 --> 30:53.350
Medic, come now.
(raspy breathing)

30:53.352 --> 30:54.484
Jules has been hit!

30:54.486 --> 30:56.453
Officer down. We need EMS.

30:56.455 --> 30:59.223
Bay and Queen.
SRU officer down.

30:59.225 --> 31:01.391
Stay with me, Jules.

31:01.393 --> 31:03.427
(labored
breathing)
Stay with me.

31:17.543 --> 31:19.543
(guttural gasp)

31:19.545 --> 31:21.511
Stay with me.

31:21.513 --> 31:23.113
Stay with me.

31:23.115 --> 31:25.482
We're under fire!
Get up here now!

31:25.484 --> 31:27.351
Somebody get an angle
on this guy!

31:27.353 --> 31:28.619
(bullets ricocheting off steel)

31:28.621 --> 31:31.288
Shots are coming
from City Hall.

31:31.290 --> 31:32.890
Boss, this is about me.

31:32.892 --> 31:36.159
I come out, draw his fire,
you get her out of the way.

31:36.161 --> 31:37.327
Negative. Negative.

31:37.329 --> 31:38.996
We do it as a team.

31:38.998 --> 31:40.230
ED:
Copy, Greg.
Get her out of there.

31:40.232 --> 31:42.566
Spike, you and me,
West Tower, City Hall.

31:42.568 --> 31:43.934
Low and tight.

31:43.936 --> 31:45.435
Louis, you cover.
Yup.

31:45.437 --> 31:47.037
(gunfire)

31:49.041 --> 31:50.240
(gunshot hits steel)

31:50.242 --> 31:51.508
(gunshot)

31:53.412 --> 31:56.446
(gunfire, metallic clinking)

31:57.383 --> 31:58.382
(gasps)

31:58.384 --> 32:00.083
Roof's a grate.

32:00.085 --> 32:01.985
We'll get eyes
on the mechanical room.

32:08.694 --> 32:10.060
Keep her sealed off.

32:10.062 --> 32:11.361
Stay tight.
Stay tight.

32:11.363 --> 32:13.330
You're gonna be okay.

32:13.332 --> 32:14.998
We're getting
you out.
Keep her stiff.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.199
We're getting
you out, Jules.

32:16.201 --> 32:17.634
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

32:17.636 --> 32:18.936
Easy! Easy!

32:18.938 --> 32:20.137
Hang on.
We got you.

32:20.139 --> 32:21.605
(gunfire continuing)

32:21.607 --> 32:23.140
Come on. Come on.

32:25.444 --> 32:27.444
She's clear!

32:27.446 --> 32:31.481
(bullets pinging and whistling)

32:35.988 --> 32:37.654
We've got him.

32:37.656 --> 32:39.323
Upper left.

32:39.325 --> 32:40.724
Go.

32:53.539 --> 32:55.605
(overlapping chatter)

33:01.714 --> 33:03.714
PARKER:
Hey, got to let her go.

33:03.716 --> 33:05.282
(mumbles)

33:05.284 --> 33:07.284
Team 4 Sierra's countering
from the East Tower.

33:07.286 --> 33:09.086
Sam, let's find
a Sierra shot.

33:09.088 --> 33:10.253
I got it.

33:10.255 --> 33:11.989
Ed, we're on our way.

33:41.553 --> 33:43.620
(birds singing)

33:45.290 --> 33:47.758
Boss, I found a vantage point.

33:49.762 --> 33:52.262
I can see the mechanical roof.

34:05.811 --> 34:07.110
Petar.

34:07.112 --> 34:09.546
For the first five minutes
of every day,

34:09.548 --> 34:11.548
I forget that he's gone.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.683
Then I remember,
and I see him die.

34:13.685 --> 34:15.118
Okay.

34:16.088 --> 34:17.421
He's got Ed.

34:17.423 --> 34:19.156
He's got a gun to his head.

34:19.158 --> 34:21.625
PARKER:
We're on our way, Spike.

34:24.763 --> 34:27.230
I don't have a clear shot.

34:27.232 --> 34:28.832
Ed's in my line of fire.

34:28.834 --> 34:31.068
Come on.
Come on! Come on!

34:31.070 --> 34:33.437
You know what it's like
to do what you got to do

34:33.439 --> 34:34.604
to save your family, okay?

34:34.606 --> 34:35.772
I'm just... I just...

34:35.774 --> 34:37.140
My family's dead.

34:37.142 --> 34:38.141
ED:
Okay, take a breath.

34:38.143 --> 34:39.476
You killed my father.

34:39.478 --> 34:41.144
Petar. Petar.

34:41.146 --> 34:42.412
He was all I had.

34:42.414 --> 34:44.514
Let's just slow it down
here, buddy, okay?

34:44.516 --> 34:46.149
I need you to...

34:46.151 --> 34:48.785
Tomorrow morning, for
the first five minutes...

34:48.787 --> 34:50.620
(panting)

34:50.622 --> 34:52.489
...your son will forget
that you're gone.

34:52.491 --> 34:53.790
I need you to listen

34:53.792 --> 34:55.358
to me now, buddy, all right?

35:01.300 --> 35:04.201
Sam, we need a solution.

35:04.203 --> 35:05.569
I can't get a clear shot.

35:05.571 --> 35:07.104
He's behind the pillar.

35:07.106 --> 35:09.739
Ed, you got to move forward.

35:09.741 --> 35:12.409
I need you to listen to me.

35:14.680 --> 35:16.847
I'm sorry, but I need you
to listen to me.

35:16.849 --> 35:18.281
Please don't shoot.

35:20.719 --> 35:21.885
(gunshot)

35:21.887 --> 35:24.154
(thudding)

35:27.259 --> 35:29.459
(loud breathing)

35:39.738 --> 35:42.405
Subject's down.

35:44.877 --> 35:48.311
(sighs)

35:51.717 --> 35:54.618
Not a good day for either of us.

35:54.620 --> 35:57.787
Yes, sir.

35:57.789 --> 35:59.523
(overlapping,
indistinct chatter)

35:59.525 --> 36:01.591
Just give him a
minute, will you?

36:02.628 --> 36:03.827
Where is she?
Saint Simon's.

36:03.829 --> 36:05.228
We're on our way.

36:05.230 --> 36:06.730
I want to go with you.
Sam.

36:06.732 --> 36:08.198
Boss, the paperwork
can't wait.
Sam.

36:08.200 --> 36:09.866
Get there
when you can, okay?

36:09.868 --> 36:11.902
We'll be there.
We're not going anywhere.

36:11.904 --> 36:14.171
It's a good job.

36:15.407 --> 36:17.474
Braddock?

36:41.733 --> 36:43.366
What? Please? Please?

36:43.368 --> 36:44.601
He was my friend.

36:44.603 --> 36:46.536
PARKER:
He's cleared.
He was my friend.

36:46.538 --> 36:49.206
Next of kin.

36:51.977 --> 36:54.311
What should I have
said to him?

36:59.618 --> 37:00.984
What should I have said?

37:00.986 --> 37:03.286
What? Hey.

37:03.288 --> 37:04.754
(sighs)

37:04.756 --> 37:06.957
You did the best
you could do.

37:06.959 --> 37:08.758
Know that.
(sniffles)

37:08.760 --> 37:09.960
You hear me?

37:09.962 --> 37:11.628
You know that.

37:11.630 --> 37:14.264
That's all
you can do.

37:14.266 --> 37:16.399
Go on.

37:25.711 --> 37:27.978
(ambulance engine starting)

37:44.763 --> 37:46.830
(rhythmic beeping)

38:04.750 --> 38:06.950
(indistinct female voice
over PA system)

38:06.952 --> 38:09.386
(beeping)

38:17.362 --> 38:19.629
Hey, Jules.

38:19.631 --> 38:21.898
Hey, sweetheart,
how you doing?

38:23.402 --> 38:25.535
I got here as fast
as I could, Jules.

38:26.538 --> 38:28.705
(beeping)

38:29.741 --> 38:31.041
(inhales deeply)

38:31.043 --> 38:32.609
I'm so sorry.

38:32.611 --> 38:35.345
(beeping)

38:36.315 --> 38:38.381
I should have protected you.

38:43.588 --> 38:45.789
Jules.

38:45.791 --> 38:47.857
(beeping)

38:50.062 --> 38:52.529
Okay, time
to go, buddy.

38:52.531 --> 38:54.364
No way.

38:54.366 --> 38:55.999
There's nothing
for you to do here.

38:56.001 --> 38:58.768
If there was, I wouldn't
let you leave. Go on.

39:00.038 --> 39:01.104
She's on my team...

39:01.106 --> 39:02.605
Eddie, you're
two hours away,

39:02.607 --> 39:04.541
anything happens,
anything changes.

39:04.543 --> 39:06.409
You need to be
with your family.

39:06.411 --> 39:08.478
Do you hear me?

39:08.480 --> 39:10.947
Those aren't
just words.

39:10.949 --> 39:12.649
Go on.

39:12.651 --> 39:14.718
All right?

39:31.770 --> 39:32.969

39:32.971 --> 39:34.137

She's stabilized.

She's in good hands.

She'll be okay.

Yeah. Want to talk about it?

40:22.487 --> 40:25.155
Okay. I'll drive.
