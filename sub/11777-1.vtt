{\an8}that there are great
female tattoo artists.

09:26.691 --> 09:27.692
<i>I think a lot</i>
<i>of female tattoo artists,</i>

09:27.775 --> 09:30.486
<i>till this day,</i>
<i>are still misinterpreted.</i>

09:30.569 --> 09:31.445
<i>I just want to prove</i>
<i>to everybody</i>

09:31.529 --> 09:33.406
<i>we deserve a lot of respect.</i>

09:33.489 --> 09:35.783
Dude, after I got used
to it, man,

09:35.866 --> 09:37.326
I actually kind of enjoyed it.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.328
<i>You don't have to worry about</i>
<i>the customer crying about it.</i>

09:39.412 --> 09:42.081
<i>I'm mostly known</i>
<i>for my comic book style tattoos</i>

09:42.164 --> 09:43.332
<i>with bright, bold,</i>
<i>contrasting colors.</i>

09:43.416 --> 09:45.626
{\an8}I was in the military
for five years.

09:45.710 --> 09:48.170
Ink Master means
that you're [bleep] bad-ass.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.172
I want the title.
The title's everything.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.883
All right, guys.
You got two hours left.

09:56.721 --> 09:58.389
What kind of stuff do you
primarily like to do?

09:58.472 --> 10:00.182
I guess new school.

10:00.266 --> 10:01.517
<i>I like to skew everything</i>
<i>a little bit,</i>

10:01.600 --> 10:03.352
<i>try to see how far</i>
<i>I can bend something</i>

10:03.436 --> 10:05.354
before it doesn't look right.

10:05.438 --> 10:06.897
I've been doing
my own style

10:06.981 --> 10:08.441
{\an8}for about seven
or eight years now.

10:08.524 --> 10:10.526
{\an8}I haven't done anything
but what I do.

10:10.609 --> 10:11.819
It's not my forte.

10:11.902 --> 10:14.071
That old school [bleep]
is not my [bleep] bit.

10:14.155 --> 10:15.740
My style is black and gray
macabre, horror,

10:15.823 --> 10:21.037
creepy, gory,
nasty-looking satanic devils.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.122
{\an8}If it's eating something,
I want to do it.

10:24.957 --> 10:26.459
Is that
what you look like inside?

10:26.542 --> 10:28.252
Yes. The muscles kind
of spiral a little bit.

10:28.336 --> 10:30.921
And then you got the spine
and the ribs going down.

10:31.005 --> 10:32.965
{\an8}My specialty
is having no specialty.

10:33.049 --> 10:34.800
I'm a Jack of every style.

10:34.884 --> 10:37.887
So I can hold my own
against anybody.

10:37.970 --> 10:39.805
Should I do something
simple and traditional?

10:39.889 --> 10:40.931
[Bleep] no.

10:41.015 --> 10:42.016
I want to do something
that's gonna wow the judges.

10:42.099 --> 10:43.434
{\an8}So I'm gonna go all out
on this one.

10:43.517 --> 10:45.770
<i>My favorite style of</i>
<i>tattooing is new school,</i>

10:45.853 --> 10:46.937
<i>without a shadow</i>
<i>of a doubt.</i>

10:47.021 --> 10:48.230
<i>It's big, bold lines,</i>
<i>bright colors,</i>

10:48.314 --> 10:51.067
in-your-face tattooing.

10:51.150 --> 10:52.902
I'm not here
to fight for second place.

10:52.985 --> 10:54.111
{\an8}If you're standing
in front of me

10:54.195 --> 10:55.363
{\an8}and I need to get through
you to get to the prize,

10:55.446 --> 10:56.822
you're getting
knocked out.

10:56.906 --> 10:59.742
<i>I specialize mostly</i>
<i>in black and gray</i>

10:59.825 --> 11:01.369
<i>and, lately, Japanese tattooing.</i>

11:01.452 --> 11:02.495
<i>When I'm not tattooing,</i>

11:02.578 --> 11:04.663
<i>I'm usually training</i>
<i>for my A.M.A. Fights.</i>

11:04.747 --> 11:06.749
{\an5}Hope they brought the Novocaine.

11:04.747 --> 11:06.749
[Machine buzzes]

11:06.832 --> 11:07.583
Alright, guys.
We've got one hour left.

11:07.666 --> 11:10.544
One hour
to finish these things up.

11:17.134 --> 11:18.010
Never thought
I'd be in a morgue

11:18.094 --> 11:20.763
getting my ass kicked
by a severed arm.

11:20.846 --> 11:22.473
<i>I have a split personality.</i>

11:22.556 --> 11:24.600
{\an8}The other side of me
they call BLB:

11:24.683 --> 11:25.434
{\an8}The Belligerent Little Bastard.

11:25.518 --> 11:28.437
<i>Been tattooing for 14 years.</i>

11:28.521 --> 11:31.982
<i>I like big, bold, sculpted lines</i>
<i>and lots of bright color.</i>

11:33.359 --> 11:35.111
Trying to pull something
out of it, man.

11:35.194 --> 11:36.153
Trying to pull something.

11:36.237 --> 11:37.697
<i>I learned to tattoo in prison.</i>

11:37.780 --> 11:38.656
{\an8}And tattooing,
it saved my life.

11:38.739 --> 11:41.367
<i>I can perform any kind</i>
<i>of tattoo.</i>

11:41.450 --> 11:43.285
<i>One of my greatest qualities</i>
<i>is the ability</i>

11:43.369 --> 11:46.705
<i>to interpret a client's idea</i>
<i>into the form of a tattoo.</i>

11:46.789 --> 11:49.458
Definitely went too big
for this skin texture.

11:49.542 --> 11:50.626
I thought it would act
like regular skin. No way.

11:50.709 --> 11:53.254
How many people
are regretting going

11:53.337 --> 11:54.380
as big as they did?

11:54.463 --> 11:55.464
Hopefully,
this will be the start

11:55.548 --> 11:57.925
of do what you can in the time.

11:58.008 --> 11:59.135
Don't do oversized [bleep].

11:59.218 --> 12:01.554
Ten seconds.

12:01.637 --> 12:04.223
Nine, eight, seven,

12:04.306 --> 12:07.518
six, five, four,

12:07.601 --> 12:09.645
three, two, one.

12:09.728 --> 12:13.482
Time's up.
Machine's down, please.

12:15.901 --> 12:17.361
Damn, I wish they
didn't have to see this.

12:17.445 --> 12:19.280
I definitely have the worst
piece of [bleep] of the day.

12:19.363 --> 12:21.449
<i>I'm so pissed.</i>

12:21.532 --> 12:23.075
<i>It's the biggest</i>
<i>piece of crap.</i>

12:23.159 --> 12:24.743
<i>This is what I'm starting</i>
<i>out of the gate with:</i>

12:24.827 --> 12:26.871
{\an8}A face full of ink and
a really [bleep] looking snake.

12:31.876 --> 12:33.586
{\an8}There is a twist.

12:33.669 --> 12:36.046
{\an8}This changes
everything.

12:36.130 --> 12:37.506
The tattoo's these clients
want are a nightmare.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.800
If I hadn't stopped
right there,

12:39.884 --> 12:41.093
you would've been on the floor.

12:41.177 --> 12:46.891
I had no idea it was going
to be this [bleep] intense.

12:46.974 --> 12:48.726
Time's up.
Machine's down, please.

12:48.809 --> 12:52.271
We're gonna come around
for the critique.

12:52.354 --> 12:54.231
Jamie. You got
a big piece on there.

12:54.315 --> 12:55.274
I overshot.

12:55.357 --> 12:58.694
At the end of that dagger
is curiously odd.

12:58.777 --> 13:02.156
Man, that snake head,
it's a dinosaur.

13:03.908 --> 13:04.658
Cee Jay.

13:04.742 --> 13:06.327
You got
to be excited about this.

13:06.410 --> 13:07.411
No, it threw me for a loop.

13:07.495 --> 13:08.496
Are we talking
about the tattoo

13:08.579 --> 13:11.207
or the face ink-splatter?

13:11.290 --> 13:12.249
I'm glad to see, though,

13:12.333 --> 13:13.125
that you did have
some black left over.

13:13.209 --> 13:14.960
It's real dark.

13:15.044 --> 13:18.631
<i>The design of the snake,</i>
<i>it looks like this is one snake,</i>

13:18.714 --> 13:21.675
<i>and then this is a totally</i>
<i>different snake going on here.</i>

13:21.759 --> 13:21.800
A little strange.

13:24.136 --> 13:25.888
Mark.

13:25.971 --> 13:28.891
Solid black areas
in this design

13:28.974 --> 13:31.352
definitely make it look
like this is a cover-up.

13:31.435 --> 13:32.561
I feel like I got to point out

13:32.645 --> 13:34.647
that you have a pretty sweet
snake head tattooed

13:34.730 --> 13:35.898
on your own neck.

13:35.981 --> 13:37.858
One would assume that you
would get a look at that

13:37.942 --> 13:38.400
every day in the mirror.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.945
I have no excuses.

13:41.028 --> 13:43.239
[David] So, Mike.
How was this to work with?

13:43.322 --> 13:44.740
It was a struggle every step
of the way.

13:44.823 --> 13:46.534
<i>I've seen a lot of drawings</i>
<i>that look like dragons, in here,</i>

13:46.617 --> 13:47.493
<i>more than snakes.</i>

13:47.576 --> 13:49.620
<i>And this is one of them.</i>

13:49.703 --> 13:51.330
<i>I would say the design</i>
<i>is just weak.</i>

13:53.082 --> 13:54.250
Ron. Wow.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.126
-I went way too big.

13:56.210 --> 13:58.087
The dagger of this
is mostly lost.

13:58.170 --> 13:59.129
You don't have much dagger
above the head.

13:59.213 --> 14:01.840
You don't have very much dagger
below the head.

14:01.924 --> 14:02.925
Don't go for size.

14:03.008 --> 14:05.302
Because size
is not gonna win the race.

14:06.512 --> 14:07.846
Tatu Baby.

14:07.930 --> 14:10.266
There's a lot
of good shading and dimension.

14:10.349 --> 14:11.016
And a lot of good color.

14:11.100 --> 14:12.810
I wanted
to concentrate more

14:12.893 --> 14:14.311
on being able
to pack in the color

14:14.395 --> 14:18.232
than go so big and not be able
to accomplish anything.

14:18.315 --> 14:19.984
Sebastian.

14:20.067 --> 14:20.943
Looks like
you can outline pretty well.

14:21.026 --> 14:22.570
It's nice
to see that it's nice and clean.

14:22.653 --> 14:25.114
{\an5}-Thank you.

14:22.653 --> 14:25.114
-Nick.

14:25.197 --> 14:27.116
This has a lot of gap
between the open spaces.

14:27.199 --> 14:30.661
Really no interaction
with the dagger and the snake.

14:30.744 --> 14:32.496
You didn't give US much
to look at.

14:33.122 --> 14:33.831
Jesse.

14:33.914 --> 14:34.373
I like the color, man.

14:34.456 --> 14:35.916
Lot of contrast.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.334
Well, you definitely have
your style.

14:37.418 --> 14:39.837
It looks really clean.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.297
I have to take Jesse down.

14:41.380 --> 14:43.841
{\an8}He's gonna be a serious
competitor in this game.

14:46.802 --> 14:47.970
Lalo.

14:48.053 --> 14:49.513
You packed a lot of color
in there.

14:49.597 --> 14:51.265
You made it solid wall-to-wall.

14:51.348 --> 14:52.641
It was more difficult
than I thought.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.184
I feel like I just jumped
and tried to land on my feet.

14:54.268 --> 14:56.103
Clint.

14:56.186 --> 14:57.062
You guys asked to show,

14:57.146 --> 14:59.273
you know,
the fundamentals of tattooing.

14:59.356 --> 15:01.567
So I showed light sources,
depth, flow.

15:01.650 --> 15:03.569
This is one of those snakes

15:03.652 --> 15:04.695
that looks a little bit
like a dragon.

15:04.778 --> 15:06.655
But it still--
it looks cool.

15:07.656 --> 15:09.074
Steve.

15:09.158 --> 15:10.659
The shading looks smooth.

15:10.743 --> 15:11.577
The outline is clean.

15:11.660 --> 15:12.745
Straight lines
and good clean curves.

15:12.828 --> 15:16.081
There's a lot
of good soft gradation.

15:16.165 --> 15:17.041
[Dave] Sarah.

15:17.124 --> 15:18.334
[Chris] The view of
the snake is cool.

15:18.417 --> 15:20.461
You went at it a different way
than everybody else.

15:20.544 --> 15:22.046
The dagger's handle,

15:22.129 --> 15:24.131
you could've done
a little bit more with it.

15:24.214 --> 15:25.883
Sarah may come off young
and innocent,

15:25.966 --> 15:27.051
but she nailed her snake.

15:27.134 --> 15:28.093
{\an8}That girl can tattoo.

15:28.177 --> 15:29.428
{\an8}She's gonna be
a tough competitor.

15:30.929 --> 15:31.972
Big Daddy Tray.

15:32.056 --> 15:35.017
This snake does not meet up
at all.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.268
Attention to detail, man.

15:36.352 --> 15:37.519
It's supposed to line up.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.104
Don't make that mistake again.

15:39.938 --> 15:41.482
TJ.

15:41.565 --> 15:43.817
I wanted to do
real bold color, make it pop.

15:43.901 --> 15:45.069
Man, you got the color good.

15:45.152 --> 15:46.320
It looks bright.

15:46.403 --> 15:47.529
As far as the detail goes,

15:47.613 --> 15:49.698
you didn't really put
any real texture or detail

15:49.782 --> 15:51.825
into the line work
or the shading of the body.

15:53.202 --> 15:54.536
Kay Kutta.

15:54.620 --> 15:57.414
That dagger is jacked.

15:57.498 --> 15:59.541
I mean it's bent,
it's crooked.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.085
{\an5}-It's slovenly.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.085
-I lost a lot of the pattern.

16:01.168 --> 16:02.294
And I just tried to, you know,

16:02.378 --> 16:04.421
make something out of it,
salvage something.

16:04.505 --> 16:05.756
It definitely
got away from you.

16:05.839 --> 16:08.133
I don't think Kay
is technically competent.

16:08.217 --> 16:10.552
If he keeps bringing what
he's bringing to the table,

16:10.636 --> 16:12.680
{\an8}and I keep bringing what
I'm bringing to the table,

16:12.763 --> 16:13.097
{\an8}he's going home.

16:17.017 --> 16:19.645
When it comes to
the fundamentals of tattooing,

16:19.728 --> 16:21.063
I think there's
a very short, narrow field

16:21.146 --> 16:23.732
of who's up for winning
the Flash Challenge.

16:23.816 --> 16:24.983
I feel like
Jesse was the one

16:25.067 --> 16:26.068
that looked like he knew what
he was doing from the start.

16:26.151 --> 16:28.904
His design was his own style.
It was deliberate.

16:28.987 --> 16:32.324
Sebastian's was clean,
smooth shading.

16:32.408 --> 16:33.659
He's definitely in my top.

16:33.742 --> 16:34.868
If you want
to talk straight fundamentals,

16:34.952 --> 16:37.996
your design layout
is the first thing.

16:38.080 --> 16:41.125
If that's bad, then it doesn't
matter how your execution is.

16:41.208 --> 16:43.127
On Tray's,
the snake didn't even line up.

16:43.210 --> 16:44.795
Before he even started
tattooing, he messed up.

16:44.878 --> 16:48.132
Yeah, but even, still,
Kay's was...

16:48.215 --> 16:49.091
A disaster too.

16:49.174 --> 16:51.927
Way, way more
in trouble than Tray.

16:52.010 --> 16:53.137
There's a lot of proving
to go on.

16:53.220 --> 16:55.180
You guys want to go in there
and declare a winner?

16:55.264 --> 16:56.098
{\an5}-Let's go.

16:55.264 --> 16:56.098
-Let's do it.

16:57.808 --> 16:58.767
In this Flash Challenge,

16:58.851 --> 17:00.477
we tested
your fundamentals skills

17:00.561 --> 17:02.104
by having you tattoo
a classic design.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.692
After reviewing everyone's work,

17:06.775 --> 17:08.402
the judges have come
to a decision.

17:10.194 --> 17:12.656
The winner
of this Flash Challenge is...

17:16.076 --> 17:17.035
Jesse.

17:19.538 --> 17:22.583
<i>I'm really excited to</i>
<i>win the first Flash Challenge.</i>

17:22.665 --> 17:24.542
{\an8}But now I have a big
target on my back.

17:24.626 --> 17:25.794
As winner
of the Flash Challenge,

17:25.877 --> 17:27.337
you'll be given an advantage

17:27.421 --> 17:28.464
in this week's
elimination tattoo

17:28.547 --> 17:30.841
that will give you an edge
over the competition.

17:30.924 --> 17:32.217
And as for the rest of you,

17:32.301 --> 17:32.968
you still have a lot to prove.

17:33.051 --> 17:35.804
There's $100,000 on the line.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.431
So go move into your loft,

17:37.514 --> 17:38.140
and we'll see you at the shop.

17:48.776 --> 17:49.777
ow.

17:50.569 --> 17:52.905
Oh, my god.

17:52.988 --> 17:53.989
That's what's up.

17:54.072 --> 17:55.824
Oh, my god!

17:55.908 --> 17:57.451
Oh, hell, yeah.
Fully stocked.

17:57.534 --> 17:58.744
This [bleep] is crazy.

17:59.661 --> 18:00.287
Oh, this is nice!

18:02.247 --> 18:03.165
I'm in here to do work.

18:03.248 --> 18:04.333
I don't know why everybody else
in here

18:04.416 --> 18:05.584
is thinking they're
in summer camp

18:05.667 --> 18:06.502
having a great [bleep] time.

18:06.585 --> 18:08.128
{\an8}I don't want
to live with these people.

18:08.212 --> 18:09.922
The faster they get the [bleep]
out of this house,

18:10.005 --> 18:11.256
the faster I get comfortable.

18:11.340 --> 18:13.550
One by one,
everybody's going home.

18:15.552 --> 18:17.721
Ah, hell.
She's skating in here?

18:18.055 --> 18:19.264
Really?

18:21.558 --> 18:22.935
I'm not here to be, you know,
buddy-buddy with everybody.

18:23.018 --> 18:25.020
I'm here
to do some serious [bleep].

18:25.103 --> 18:26.897
So I'm hoping you guys
are on the same level,

18:26.980 --> 18:28.273
because, if not,
we are gonna have problems.

18:30.317 --> 18:31.109
Wow.

18:38.158 --> 18:39.993
{\an5}-Holy [bleep].

18:38.158 --> 18:39.993
-Nice.

18:40.077 --> 18:41.703
This place is so dope.

18:41.787 --> 18:44.122
{\an5}-Now this is a tattoo shop.

18:41.787 --> 18:44.122
-[Solitary applause]

18:47.709 --> 18:48.836
-Shop is great.

18:48.919 --> 18:51.171
I can't wait
to do my first tattoo.

18:51.255 --> 18:51.296
{\an8}The place is sick.

18:53.799 --> 18:55.509
Welcome, guys.

18:55.592 --> 18:57.511
For the elimination tattoos,

18:57.594 --> 18:59.972
you'll be permanently inking
human canvases.

19:00.055 --> 19:01.056
Make them proud,

19:01.139 --> 19:03.267
and you'll be on your way
to a $100,000 prize

19:03.350 --> 19:05.060
a feature
in <i> Inked</i> magazine,

19:05.144 --> 19:08.188
and the title of Ink Master.

19:08.272 --> 19:09.022
This week,

19:09.106 --> 19:10.899
we're testing
your fundamentals.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.485
Every year, thousands of people
are getting their first tattoos.

19:13.569 --> 19:16.363
Tattoo virgins offer plenty
of clean skin,

19:16.446 --> 19:18.740
but they're not always
the easiest clients.

19:18.824 --> 19:22.202
Today, you'll be giving
a virgin their first tattoo.

19:24.746 --> 19:26.957
Why do we have
to tattoo virgin skin?

19:27.040 --> 19:30.669
{\an8}It is, by far,
the worst thing.

19:30.752 --> 19:31.712
You might get somebody
to just say,

19:31.795 --> 19:32.963
"I can't do this anymore,"

19:33.046 --> 19:35.674
and I'm gone because
of a client.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.844
So let's meet your canvases.

19:45.893 --> 19:46.643
Jesse.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.562
As winner
of the Flash Challenge,

19:48.645 --> 19:51.523
not only do you get
to pick your own canvas,

19:51.607 --> 19:52.316
there is a twist.

19:54.401 --> 19:55.569
You now have the power

19:55.652 --> 19:57.321
to assign all
of the human canvases.

19:59.698 --> 20:01.074
This changes
everything.

20:01.158 --> 20:03.952
{\an8}This is gonna become
a dog-eat-dog thing.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.954
It's more
on a personal level now.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.039
{\an8}You're personally gunning
the people

20:07.122 --> 20:09.875
you think are a threat.
That's huge.

20:09.958 --> 20:12.127
Remember, you're not here
to make friends.

20:12.211 --> 20:15.797
You're here
to win $100,000.

20:15.881 --> 20:16.632
What you want?

20:16.715 --> 20:19.259
A picture
of a realistic place,

20:19.343 --> 20:21.094
where everything
is made out of bacon.

20:22.387 --> 20:23.472
This guy is crazy.

20:23.555 --> 20:26.475
Do you want something
that is just so far-fetched?

20:26.558 --> 20:27.476
God, please, in heaven,

20:27.559 --> 20:28.810
don't let that
fall in my lap.

20:28.894 --> 20:29.770
What you want, man?

20:29.853 --> 20:32.147
I want a Japanese
warrior riding a turtle,

20:32.230 --> 20:33.607
having a snake as a leash.

20:34.816 --> 20:36.485
{\an8}I'm definitely trying
to be strategic.

20:36.568 --> 20:39.237
{\an5}-What do you want?

20:36.568 --> 20:39.237
-Mechanical gears, pulleys.

20:39.321 --> 20:40.530
I'm basically being put
in a position

20:40.614 --> 20:43.784
where I'm gonna make a bunch of
enemies right from the get-go.

20:43.867 --> 20:45.243
{\an5}-What do you want?

20:43.867 --> 20:45.243
-I want cobra

20:45.327 --> 20:47.162
that turns into
a double helix on my ribs.

20:47.245 --> 20:48.664
The guy wants a snake?

20:48.747 --> 20:51.124
{\an8}That would be, like,
perfect way to bounce back.

20:51.208 --> 20:52.501
I know Jesse's gonna give it
to me.

20:52.584 --> 20:53.919
This is biblical, right here.
I need it.

20:54.002 --> 20:56.588
{\an5}-Here you go.

20:54.002 --> 20:56.588
-Jesse!

20:57.923 --> 20:59.007
{\an5}-That's it.

20:57.923 --> 20:59.007
-Canvases...

20:59.091 --> 21:01.301
One by one, read the name
on the bottom of your skull.

21:05.430 --> 21:06.264
Sarah.

21:06.348 --> 21:10.352
And, of course,
Jesse assigns me bacon.

21:10.435 --> 21:12.604
{\an8}[Bleep] You, Jesse.
This sucks.

21:13.146 --> 21:14.231
Cee Jay.

21:14.314 --> 21:14.398
-"Big daddy" Tray.

21:15.649 --> 21:16.650
Mark.

21:16.984 --> 21:18.443
Steve.

21:18.527 --> 21:19.861
Ron.

21:19.945 --> 21:21.196
Jesse.

21:21.279 --> 21:21.530
Mike.

21:21.613 --> 21:23.532
Jamie.

21:23.615 --> 21:24.449
Kay Kutta.

21:24.533 --> 21:26.034
Jesse assigns me
a human canvas

21:26.118 --> 21:26.994
{\an8}that wants a skull
and a crown.

21:27.077 --> 21:28.203
{\an8}I think he
throwing me a bone,

21:28.286 --> 21:30.872
but, at this point,
I kind of need a bone.

21:30.956 --> 21:31.999
Tatu Baby.

21:32.332 --> 21:33.542
Clint.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.252
Sebastian.

21:35.711 --> 21:36.545
Nick.

21:36.628 --> 21:37.546
Lalo.

21:39.965 --> 21:41.508
You guys have the rest
of the evening

21:41.591 --> 21:43.176
to talk with your tattoo virgin

21:43.260 --> 21:44.553
and come up with a design.

21:44.636 --> 21:46.805
Tomorrow, you'll have six hours
to tattoo.

21:46.888 --> 21:48.015
Based on your work,

21:48.098 --> 21:51.309
one of you will be
the first artist

21:51.393 --> 21:53.645
to close their shop
and go home.

21:54.354 --> 21:55.480
Good luck.

21:57.149 --> 21:57.941
Hello.

21:58.025 --> 21:59.985
{\an8}Very rarely
does somebody walk in

22:00.068 --> 22:01.945
{\an8}on their first tattoo
and not give a [bleep].

22:02.029 --> 22:04.197
So kind of like a Crescent
or a jagged peak.

22:04.281 --> 22:05.615
They're gonna be real picky.

22:05.699 --> 22:07.409
This is a perfect challenge
for the fundamentals.

22:07.492 --> 22:11.663
All right, so you wanted
a cobra on your rib cage?

22:11.747 --> 22:13.331
You want a scorpion
and a bull.

22:13.415 --> 22:15.917
I like the idea of the blood
and the purple.

22:16.001 --> 22:16.501
{\an5}-You know what I'm saying?

22:16.001 --> 22:16.501
-Yeah, man.

22:16.585 --> 22:17.836
We gonna rock it, man.

22:17.919 --> 22:19.254
Thank you
for not getting bacon.

22:19.337 --> 22:22.841
So you want a city made
of bacon.

22:22.924 --> 22:25.093
{\an8}My human canvas wants
this big back piece.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.428
{\an5}-Upper back, right?

22:25.177 --> 22:26.428
-Yep.

22:26.511 --> 22:29.097
All right, so we're only
gonna have about six hours.

22:29.181 --> 22:30.223
{\an5}-We want it to work.

22:29.181 --> 22:30.223
-Yeah.

22:30.307 --> 22:31.391
And I don't want
to bite off something

22:31.475 --> 22:33.643
and leave you
with something half-finished.

22:33.727 --> 22:36.605
A back piece
is not easily accomplished

22:36.688 --> 22:37.606
in six hours.

22:37.689 --> 22:38.774
There's a lot of detail.

22:38.857 --> 22:42.194
And I'm not really sure
if I'm gonna be able to finish.

22:50.410 --> 22:51.995
I'm so
[bleep] nervous.

22:52.079 --> 22:54.289
I'm asking myself what
the [bleep] I'm doing here.

22:54.372 --> 22:56.375
There's so many things at stake.

22:58.168 --> 22:59.461
I know if I [bleep] this up,

22:59.544 --> 23:01.046
the judges
are gonna send me packing.

23:01.129 --> 23:02.589
There's a lot
of talented people here

23:02.672 --> 23:03.673
[bleep] their pants.

23:03.757 --> 23:06.134
{\an8}This has to be
the best angel I've ever done.

23:06.218 --> 23:08.220
Somebody didn't
do her homework.

23:10.722 --> 23:12.015
For today's
elimination tattoo,

23:12.099 --> 23:14.601
we're testing
your fundamentals tattoo skills.

23:14.684 --> 23:15.185
You have six hours.

23:15.268 --> 23:18.313
And your time starts...

23:18.647 --> 23:19.731
Now.

23:23.026 --> 23:24.361
{\an8}For the elimination
tattoo today,

23:24.444 --> 23:27.656
we are looking for the cleanest,
most-solid fundamentals,

23:27.739 --> 23:28.573
quality tattoos.

23:28.657 --> 23:30.450
{\an5}-That's gonna fit sick, man.

23:28.657 --> 23:30.450
-Yeah.

23:30.534 --> 23:31.743
These canvases are sensitive

23:31.827 --> 23:33.203
because they're first-timers,
they're virgins.

23:33.286 --> 23:34.746
That's the gray area.

23:34.830 --> 23:36.706
Because some of the tattoos
these clients want

23:36.790 --> 23:37.666
are a nightmare.

23:37.749 --> 23:39.167
If you feel
like you're gonna throw up

23:39.251 --> 23:40.252
or anything like that,
we'll get some water,

23:40.335 --> 23:41.586
get some food in you,
and you'll be good to go.

23:41.670 --> 23:42.170
{\an5}-You got a bucket in here?

23:41.670 --> 23:42.170
-We got a trash can.

23:42.254 --> 23:43.255
All right, all right.

23:43.338 --> 23:45.841
Stay calm,
keep breathing there.

23:45.924 --> 23:47.342
{\an5}-[Exhales]

23:45.924 --> 23:47.342
-Are you nervous?

23:47.425 --> 23:48.760
Oh, super nervous.

23:48.844 --> 23:50.303
{\an5}-Super nervous? Oh, great.

23:48.844 --> 23:50.303
-Yes.

23:50.387 --> 23:51.596
Well, you know what?
So am I.

23:52.973 --> 23:54.683
All right.

23:54.766 --> 23:56.476
Took everything
that you wanted,

23:56.560 --> 23:57.644
threw it in there.

23:57.727 --> 23:58.687
What do you think?

23:58.770 --> 24:01.356
Oh, my god.
That is amazing.

24:01.439 --> 24:04.526
I'm lucky enough
to land a tattoo

24:04.609 --> 24:07.320
of a ninja riding a turtle,
in a lake,

24:07.404 --> 24:08.905
with a snake as a leash.

24:08.989 --> 24:10.574
{\an8}This tattoo sucks.

24:11.867 --> 24:14.202
Everything cool?

24:14.286 --> 24:15.537
It's amazing, actually.

24:15.620 --> 24:18.206
I have to just demonstrate
fundamentals of tattooing,

24:18.290 --> 24:19.541
and get the [bleep] out
of this tattoo

24:19.624 --> 24:20.834
while I still have a chance to.

24:21.293 --> 24:23.461
Are you dying?

24:23.545 --> 24:23.628
You got to earn it.

24:26.173 --> 24:29.885
My strategy is
to do a different style

24:29.968 --> 24:32.512
{\an8}of tattooing,
every single tattoo.

24:32.596 --> 24:33.805
An Ink Master, to me,

24:33.889 --> 24:35.348
is somebody
that can do every style.

24:35.432 --> 24:38.059
{\an5}-Did you just draw this up?

24:35.432 --> 24:38.059
-Yes.

24:38.143 --> 24:40.687
That is drawn from looking
at a regular playing card.

24:40.770 --> 24:42.856
I'm not the one
to be underestimated.

24:42.939 --> 24:44.941
Bottom three? Me? Nah.

24:45.650 --> 24:46.693
Nah.

24:46.776 --> 24:49.279
[Tattoo machines buzzing]

24:49.362 --> 24:50.906
I'm really
just barely tapping you.

24:50.989 --> 24:52.032
{\an5}-That's tapping?

24:50.989 --> 24:52.032
-[Tattoo machine buzzes]

24:53.158 --> 24:55.410
I'm really, really,
really excited about this.

24:55.493 --> 24:57.162
I think I'm really
gonna impress the judges.

24:57.245 --> 24:59.706
The placement's great.

24:59.789 --> 25:01.625
I'm using a lot
of pretty color.

25:01.708 --> 25:03.126
I'm determined
to show the judges

25:03.210 --> 25:04.252
that I know what I'm doing.

25:04.336 --> 25:05.795
I'm not doing so bad.

25:05.879 --> 25:08.215
[Bleep], Cee Jay,
keep rockin'.

25:08.298 --> 25:10.759
{\an8}I actually think
Cee Jay's tattoo is pretty weak.

25:10.842 --> 25:12.719
{\an8}And this might be
a bit of a dick move,

25:12.802 --> 25:13.970
{\an8}but I'm actually
encouraging her.

25:14.054 --> 25:18.016
Sometimes a false sense
of security goes a long way.

25:18.099 --> 25:19.893
Three hours, guys.
Halfway there.

25:24.022 --> 25:25.106
Ouch.

25:25.190 --> 25:26.358
So brutal, man.

25:28.610 --> 25:30.737
My canvas looks like he's
about to pass out.

33:51.988 --> 33:53.114
But where the snake goes back
like this, you see the body.

33:53.197 --> 33:55.241
It's just like a snake head
on a worm.

33:55.324 --> 33:57.660
The turtle's got five toenails
with a sixth toe, on one leg,

33:57.744 --> 33:58.786
and four on the other.

33:58.870 --> 33:59.662
Where are you
seeing this at?

33:59.746 --> 34:01.622
As far as your designing,

34:01.706 --> 34:03.124
making this thing come together,

34:03.207 --> 34:05.126
there's a lot of elements
that you lost it on.

34:06.377 --> 34:08.254
TJ.

34:08.337 --> 34:09.505
You packed this thing solid
with color,

34:09.589 --> 34:11.132
black, purple low lights,

34:11.215 --> 34:13.050
turquoise highlights,
lots of yellow.

34:13.134 --> 34:14.677
It looks like the color
is in there.

34:14.761 --> 34:16.012
I was really trying
to impress you guys

34:16.094 --> 34:17.722
and do something
totally different.

34:17.804 --> 34:18.806
Man, the outline,
it is all over the place.

34:18.889 --> 34:21.350
I don't know what was going on.

34:21.434 --> 34:23.770
We got 16 people.
Somebody's got to get out.

34:23.853 --> 34:26.481
We got to know who can do
the basic fundamentals.

34:26.563 --> 34:28.274
Do we know,
at looking at this tattoo,

34:28.357 --> 34:29.734
if you can do
a clean outline?

34:29.817 --> 34:30.275
No, we don't.

34:32.487 --> 34:34.572
Cee Jay.

34:36.616 --> 34:37.949
How are you doing?

34:38.034 --> 34:38.909
I'm freaking out.

34:38.993 --> 34:41.078
I'm not a fan
of the colored outline.

34:41.161 --> 34:42.996
Well, I was kind of going
for a softer feel.

34:43.080 --> 34:46.417
That brown outline
looks like [bleep].

34:46.501 --> 34:48.335
Look at the outline
of that hand.

34:48.418 --> 34:51.797
I believe that, over time,
it's gonna get even worse.

34:51.880 --> 34:55.259
There's a lot of stuff done
almost exclusively with color.

34:55.342 --> 34:56.636
And I think it holds up great
over time.

34:56.719 --> 34:59.138
You did a pretty face,

34:59.222 --> 35:00.348
which bums me out.

35:00.431 --> 35:02.391
Because if you had just done it
with a black outline,

35:02.475 --> 35:04.811
you would be standing
in different shoes.

35:04.894 --> 35:05.853
You've had a rough start.

35:05.937 --> 35:07.688
[Bleep], man,
your ink blew up,

35:07.772 --> 35:09.357
and this and that,
I know it, dude.

35:09.440 --> 35:11.108
I feel you.
And I want to see you do great.

35:11.192 --> 35:14.028
And you've proved
that you kind of know

35:14.111 --> 35:16.030
to do certain things,
by doing that face that way.

35:16.114 --> 35:18.741
But how do you do that face
and then,

35:18.825 --> 35:19.659
just move off
to the right and lose it.

35:19.742 --> 35:21.285
You've got to pick it up.

35:26.457 --> 35:27.667
Okay, artists,

35:27.750 --> 35:31.003
one of you will be packing
your machines and closing shop.

35:31.087 --> 35:31.963
Head on back to the loft,

35:32.046 --> 35:32.547
and when we've made
our decision,

35:32.630 --> 35:34.757
we'll call you back.

35:42.682 --> 35:43.891
Realistically,

35:43.975 --> 35:45.852
if you go by
who got their ass chewed out...

35:46.602 --> 35:49.397
TJ and her got their ass chewed.

35:49.480 --> 35:52.024
I mean, they were harsh.
They were harsh on everybody.

35:52.108 --> 35:53.359
Were you confident
with yours

35:53.442 --> 35:54.318
{\an5}-before you went up there today?

35:53.442 --> 35:54.318
-No.

35:54.402 --> 35:56.654
Do you think you have
the worst tattoo?

35:56.737 --> 35:57.238
No.

35:57.321 --> 35:58.573
If not you, then who?

35:58.656 --> 35:59.740
Who deserves to go?

35:59.824 --> 36:00.700
I'm not doing that.
I'm not--

36:00.783 --> 36:02.535
Which tattoo should go home
before you?

36:02.618 --> 36:05.079
{\an5}-Yours.

36:02.618 --> 36:05.079
-No!

36:05.163 --> 36:06.622
Cee Jay, get ready to fight.

36:06.706 --> 36:07.665
You're about to have to fight,
I'm telling you that right now.

36:07.748 --> 36:09.959
Oh, [bleep] Off!

36:10.042 --> 36:11.711
I'm gonna fight
for my survival.

36:11.794 --> 36:12.879
It's not personal.

36:12.962 --> 36:15.590
{\an8}I'm not here
to be Cee Jay's friend.

36:15.673 --> 36:16.716
I'm here to win.

36:16.799 --> 36:18.092
If it's me and you
standing there,

36:18.175 --> 36:19.093
save yourself.

36:19.176 --> 36:20.636
[Stammers] 'Cause
I don't plan on leaving.

36:20.720 --> 36:22.972
It's going down.

36:32.481 --> 36:34.483
All right, so it's
fundamentals of tattooing.

36:34.567 --> 36:35.651
The basics.

36:35.735 --> 36:36.944
Sebastian's playing card.

36:37.028 --> 36:37.820
This one's my tattoo of the day.

36:37.904 --> 36:40.323
It jumps off the skin.

36:40.406 --> 36:42.199
I think, graphically,
it's designed well.

36:42.283 --> 36:45.411
That clean look
is what we're looking for.

36:45.494 --> 36:47.955
Steve.
Now this is the gears.

36:48.039 --> 36:49.790
It's just so clean.

36:49.874 --> 36:50.917
It shows
that he's really proficient

36:51.000 --> 36:52.877
in his equipment
and his style

36:52.960 --> 36:54.795
and his confidence.

36:54.879 --> 36:56.631
If I had to say who,
fundamentally,

36:56.714 --> 36:58.466
looks like
they just don't have it at all,

36:58.549 --> 37:02.261
I'm gonna say Kay Kutta looks
like he just doesn't have it.

37:02.345 --> 37:03.679
Kay Kutta's skull.

37:03.763 --> 37:04.680
I don't think anybody
liked that.

37:04.764 --> 37:06.015
Well, he freaked me out,

37:06.098 --> 37:07.141
because he said that
he doesn't do outlines.

37:07.224 --> 37:09.810
I mean, we're talking about
fundamentals and basics.

37:09.894 --> 37:11.145
Yeah, you gotta
do an outline.

37:11.228 --> 37:13.356
I don't know that he's got
the fundamentals to bounce back.

37:14.899 --> 37:16.150
Cee Jay.

37:16.233 --> 37:17.985
Well, like Nunez said,
she did a beautiful face.

37:18.069 --> 37:19.445
Hold on a second, bud.

37:20.571 --> 37:22.615
Did she misspell
"Corinthians"?

37:22.698 --> 37:23.950
Oh, my god.

37:24.033 --> 37:25.785
She misspelled
"Corinthians" here.

37:25.868 --> 37:29.330
{\an5}-C-o-r-t-n-t-h--

37:25.868 --> 37:29.330
-Wow.

37:29.413 --> 37:31.582
{\an5}-It's supposed to be c-o-r--

37:29.413 --> 37:31.582
-i-n.

37:31.666 --> 37:33.876
I was so adamant
just at how sketchy

37:33.960 --> 37:36.128
and how the outline
looked so terrible to me...

37:36.212 --> 37:38.297
{\an5}-Wow.

37:36.212 --> 37:38.297
-I did not even

37:38.381 --> 37:39.548
look at the spelling.

37:39.632 --> 37:41.801
Wow, that's a game-changer
right there.

37:41.884 --> 37:43.803
There's clear people
that should go home today.

37:43.886 --> 37:46.847
I'm talking Cee Jay,
I'm talking Kay Kutta.

37:46.931 --> 37:48.891
I think we're good, man.
I think we know which one.

37:48.975 --> 37:50.226
All right, man.
Do you want to go get 'em?

37:50.309 --> 37:51.185
I'll do it.

37:51.268 --> 37:52.687
All right, man,
head over to the loft.

37:57.942 --> 38:00.027
All right, guys.

38:00.111 --> 38:05.533
We need to see kutta, Steve,
Cee Jay, and Sebastian.

38:05.616 --> 38:06.701
Meet me in the shop.

38:20.297 --> 38:20.798
Two of you
impressed US today

38:20.881 --> 38:23.384
and two of you did not.

38:25.761 --> 38:27.346
Steve and Sebastian,

38:27.430 --> 38:28.431
you guys have
the top two tattoos.

38:34.729 --> 38:37.231
Cee Jay, Kay Kutta,

38:37.315 --> 38:39.984
neither of you
impressed US tonight.

38:41.444 --> 38:43.821
Kay Kutta, you have
a rough time with outlining.

38:43.904 --> 38:45.322
I can outline.

38:45.406 --> 38:46.699
I've been rushing through
my tattoos to get 'em done.

38:46.782 --> 38:48.492
{\an5}-I know better.

38:46.782 --> 38:48.492
-Not driving the outline

38:48.576 --> 38:49.577
home next week,

38:49.660 --> 38:51.495
you wouldn't even have
a leg to stand on.

38:51.579 --> 38:52.496
I'm a better competitor

38:52.580 --> 38:53.664
and I'm a stronger artist
than Cee Jay.

38:53.748 --> 38:56.500
The first time I touched
a machine was three years ago.

38:56.584 --> 38:58.127
I taught myself in prison
how to tattoo.

38:58.210 --> 38:59.587
I'm self-taught
and I learn fast,

38:59.670 --> 39:01.422
and I'll take
what you guys told me

39:01.505 --> 39:04.675
and I'll be a better competitor
tomorrow.

39:04.759 --> 39:08.054
Cee Jay, let's take
a look at your tattoo.

39:08.137 --> 39:10.765
Can you read for us
what it says on that banner?

39:10.848 --> 39:14.268
"First Corinthians 13:1-7."

39:14.351 --> 39:17.688
Read it again.
Sound it out phonetically.

39:17.772 --> 39:21.901
{\an5}-Cor--

39:17.772 --> 39:21.901
-"Corinthians" is misspelled.

39:24.320 --> 39:27.364
{\an5}-What happened there?

39:24.320 --> 39:27.364
-I don't know.

39:30.367 --> 39:32.244
I think, I mean,
just a mistake.

39:32.328 --> 39:35.414
This competition
is not the time

39:35.498 --> 39:38.542
to make these big,
big mistakes,

39:38.626 --> 39:41.462
and a misspelling mistake
is huge.

39:41.545 --> 39:42.797
I don't know how
I missed that.

39:42.880 --> 39:45.508
80 to 90 percent of what I do
is cover-up,

39:45.591 --> 39:47.259
so for me,
it's an easy fix.

39:47.343 --> 39:49.970
How are you gonna make
that "t" an "i"?

39:50.054 --> 39:52.640
If-- if I plug it real hard
with some whites and ochres--

39:52.723 --> 39:54.892
Then what do you do
about the jacked-up word?

39:54.975 --> 39:57.561
It's just the difference
between an "i" and a "t."

39:57.645 --> 39:58.896
That's an easy fix.

39:58.979 --> 40:01.065
You should work at a plastic
surgeon's office, then,

40:01.148 --> 40:02.691
'cause you'd make
a [bleep] load of money.

40:02.775 --> 40:04.652
I call total [bleep]
on that theory.

40:04.735 --> 40:06.070
I don't believe it.

40:10.074 --> 40:11.117
Cee Jay...

40:12.785 --> 40:15.287
Kay Kutta...

40:15.371 --> 40:18.499
Either one of you could be
justifiably sent home tonight.

40:21.544 --> 40:23.087
The judges have decided.

40:29.218 --> 40:32.763
Cee Jay, you do not have what
it takes to be Ink Master.

40:34.598 --> 40:37.393
Please pack up your machines
and close up shop.

40:38.394 --> 40:40.479
Yes, I really feel like
I ruined my career.

40:40.563 --> 40:43.816
I wish I were a quitter,
because, at this point,

40:43.899 --> 40:46.318
I would almost like to stop
tattooing,

40:46.402 --> 40:50.156
but unfortunately,
I just can't quit like that.

40:50.239 --> 40:51.782
I never thought
in a million years

40:51.866 --> 40:53.200
I'd be the first one
eliminated.

40:57.413 --> 40:59.999
[announcer] <i> On the next</i>
<i>episode of</i> Ink Master...

41:00.082 --> 41:03.002
Your challenge is to
make your canvas disappear.

41:03.085 --> 41:05.462
My wife is
gonna be pissed.

41:05.546 --> 41:06.797
{\an5}-Aah!

41:05.546 --> 41:06.797
-You gave her

41:06.881 --> 41:07.923
an ugly-ass tattoo.

41:08.007 --> 41:09.717
{\an8}He has to intimidate,
'cause his tattoos don't.

41:09.800 --> 41:11.969
{\an8}I got to give you
what you need to do, boy.

41:12.052 --> 41:13.262
{\an8}You're lucky that girl
can't spell,

41:13.345 --> 41:14.471
{\an8}'cause they would have
shipped your ass out already.

41:14.555 --> 41:17.057
{\an8}For this challenge,
you took the easy way out.

41:17.141 --> 41:18.517
I thought you were
gonna murder this thing,

41:18.601 --> 41:20.144
but it murdered you.

41:20.227 --> 41:21.228
{\an5}-Wow.

41:20.227 --> 41:21.228
-He's hurting.

41:21.312 --> 41:22.730
He's been in the war.

41:22.813 --> 41:24.064
He got blown up
in a damn tank.

41:24.148 --> 41:25.524
I can't handle
the pain anymore.

41:25.608 --> 41:26.525
[Siren]
