Even after that kicking?

37:36.430 --> 37:38.590
I look guilty as hell.

37:56.100 --> 37:59.310
How could it have known
the chancellor would be here?

38:00.570 --> 38:02.650
It must have been blind luck.

38:04.990 --> 38:09.100
Still playing the detective,
are we?

38:09.300 --> 38:11.280
It came for the fae prisoners.

38:13.450 --> 38:15.980
- Why?
- Why? Hmm.

38:16.180 --> 38:18.570
Why? Why?

38:18.770 --> 38:20.780
Why...

38:20.980 --> 38:24.530
Why... Why do we care?

38:24.730 --> 38:26.870
Why do we care? Why do we care?

38:27.070 --> 38:29.290
That's the question.

38:29.490 --> 38:31.290
Because people are
getting killed.

38:31.490 --> 38:34.640
Sparases got killed,
didn't they?

38:37.730 --> 38:42.230
Slaughtered, right in front
of our very eyes.

38:43.610 --> 38:45.890
We could have stopped that.
We could have stopped that.

38:46.090 --> 38:51.870
All we had to do
was admit to being fae.

38:53.790 --> 38:54.730
It wouldn't have saved
the Sparases.

38:54.930 --> 38:56.060
It would have destroyed my life.

38:56.260 --> 38:57.360
[cackles]

38:57.560 --> 38:58.980
It wouldn't have saved
the Sparases...

38:59.180 --> 39:01.780
[muttering]

39:01.980 --> 39:04.490
Yes, of course.

39:04.690 --> 39:09.370
Us passing as human,
that's far more important.

39:09.570 --> 39:11.660
I had to.

39:11.860 --> 39:12.750
They hate us.

39:12.950 --> 39:14.460
No! No!

39:14.660 --> 39:15.580
I had to.

39:15.780 --> 39:17.710
No! No.

39:17.910 --> 39:19.750
- They hate us.
- No.

39:19.950 --> 39:22.110
We hate us.

39:26.940 --> 39:28.600
Philo and I were finished.

39:28.800 --> 39:30.220
He's the one
that got me locked up.

39:30.420 --> 39:31.720
I could've been killed.

39:31.920 --> 39:33.770
He knew that and
he went to get you out

39:33.970 --> 39:35.940
even though he knew
he might not make it back.

39:36.140 --> 39:38.190
Well, that's just like him,
trying to make himself

39:38.390 --> 39:40.190
feel better
by trying to be the hero.

39:40.390 --> 39:42.400
- Fucking Philo.
- Okay, well,
he's alive, at least.

39:42.600 --> 39:46.780
His Darkasher's
still... squirming.

39:46.980 --> 39:49.950
So what am I supposed to do now?
Go back and get him?

39:50.150 --> 39:53.410
You wouldn't get anywhere
near Bleakness. Not now.

39:53.610 --> 39:57.670
The army's on every corner,
looking for escaped prisoners.

39:57.870 --> 39:59.590
What's he doing here?

39:59.780 --> 40:01.250
- I live here.
- [Tourmaline] It's
a long story.

40:01.450 --> 40:02.630
But hang on a minute,
I'm confused.

40:02.830 --> 40:04.880
If it wasn't Philo,
then how did you escape?

40:05.080 --> 40:06.400
Haven't you heard?

40:07.650 --> 40:09.640
It's all over the Row.

40:09.840 --> 40:11.910
What is?

40:12.990 --> 40:14.490
It was a Sparas.

40:16.490 --> 40:17.910
A Sparas.

40:21.580 --> 40:23.190
[gasps softly]

40:23.390 --> 40:25.110
- I'm gonna be sick.
- What are you... Why? What...

40:25.310 --> 40:27.990
what's... what's wrong?

40:28.190 --> 40:29.780
[Darius] Uh...

40:29.980 --> 40:31.590
She's got the Sight now.

40:32.590 --> 40:34.590
She can see through its eyes.

40:36.470 --> 40:38.250
Your visions.

40:38.450 --> 40:40.230
It's coming to kill me.

40:42.230 --> 40:43.500
[panting]

40:43.700 --> 40:45.880
Fuck off.

40:46.080 --> 40:47.860
I don't hate who I am.

40:49.900 --> 40:51.220
Really?

40:51.420 --> 40:55.970
After everything
the priests beat into us

40:56.170 --> 40:58.870
about human purity...

41:00.870 --> 41:04.230
...and the sinful, filthy fae?

41:04.430 --> 41:07.250
I never believed
any of that shit.

41:11.760 --> 41:15.010
Still ran off to join the army,
though, didn't we?

41:16.300 --> 41:19.750
Still became police, didn't we?

41:19.950 --> 41:22.460
To help people.

41:22.660 --> 41:24.840
To help people like us.

41:25.040 --> 41:27.510
To help ourselves, you mean.

41:27.710 --> 41:32.720
[echoes] Much easier to hide
amongst Critch-haters

41:32.920 --> 41:34.640
wearing a uniform.

41:34.840 --> 41:36.870
I'm not hiding anymore.

41:38.700 --> 41:42.100
Helping the police
hurts the fae. Hiding.

41:42.300 --> 41:43.360
Hiding.

41:43.550 --> 41:45.360
Helping the police...

41:45.560 --> 41:48.070
Helping the police
hurts the fae.

41:48.270 --> 41:49.240
Hiding.

41:49.440 --> 41:51.820
Helping the police
hurts the fae.

41:52.020 --> 41:53.200
Hurts the fae.

41:53.400 --> 41:54.740
Hiding.

41:54.940 --> 41:57.740
Helping the police
hurts the fae.

41:57.940 --> 41:58.870
Hurts the fae.

41:59.070 --> 42:00.790
Hiding.

42:00.990 --> 42:02.830
Helping the police
hurts the fae.

42:03.030 --> 42:03.880
Hiding.

42:04.080 --> 42:07.710
Hiding. Hiding.

42:07.910 --> 42:10.380
Why would it want to hurt you?

42:10.580 --> 42:13.010
I don't know why. I just,
I just know that it will.

42:13.210 --> 42:16.600
Just run.
Run for your fucking life.

42:16.800 --> 42:19.350
- And go where?
- Anywhere.

42:19.550 --> 42:21.600
Anywhere. Anywhere but here.

42:21.800 --> 42:23.980
Uh, that's not
how the Sight works.

42:24.180 --> 42:26.980
This is going to happen,
no matter what I do.

42:27.180 --> 42:28.610
Says who?

42:28.810 --> 42:31.070
[chuckles] Some Mima?

42:31.270 --> 42:34.160
Since when have you ever
believed anything a Mima said?

42:34.360 --> 42:36.720
Since my visions started
coming true, Vignette.

42:39.470 --> 42:41.040
Forget the Mimas.

42:41.240 --> 42:43.120
I'm gonna get you out of here.

42:43.320 --> 42:45.580
Through that hole
I cut in the flywire.

42:45.780 --> 42:48.960
You heard Darius.
The Army's watching the skies.

42:49.160 --> 42:52.550
We'll go at night,
we'll fly low.

42:52.750 --> 42:55.390
We?

42:55.590 --> 42:57.600
You and me.

42:57.800 --> 43:00.390
I'm coming with you.

43:00.590 --> 43:03.020
[laughs]

43:03.220 --> 43:04.730
So you're just gonna
run off with me

43:04.930 --> 43:06.410
with Philo trapped in Bleakness.

43:08.710 --> 43:10.190
I want to help you.

43:10.390 --> 43:12.420
You need my help.
Please, let me help you.

43:14.420 --> 43:17.300
- I... [stammers]
- [sighs]

43:19.630 --> 43:21.680
No.

43:23.220 --> 43:25.060
No?

43:29.190 --> 43:30.960
I love you.

43:31.160 --> 43:32.630
You know I do.

43:32.830 --> 43:34.220
And I know that
when you make these promises,

43:34.420 --> 43:35.720
you believe what you're saying.

43:35.920 --> 43:39.430
- Of course I do.
- But I can't rely on you.

43:39.630 --> 43:41.010
Y-You have no idea
what I've been through,

43:41.210 --> 43:42.720
because there's always
something or someone

43:42.920 --> 43:44.830
more important than me.

43:49.330 --> 43:51.610
Bullshit. That's bullshit.

43:51.810 --> 43:54.440
You're in shock.

43:54.640 --> 43:56.660
You almost died tonight,
so, right now,

43:56.850 --> 43:58.160
running off with me

43:58.360 --> 43:59.910
probably does seem
like a good idea, but...

44:00.110 --> 44:01.790
you'll find another
worthy cause tomorrow

44:01.980 --> 44:03.930
and another one
the day after that.

44:06.600 --> 44:07.670
You'll change your mind, Vinny,

44:07.870 --> 44:09.210
and I can't go
through that again.

44:09.410 --> 44:10.560
I can't.

44:14.900 --> 44:15.970
I'm sorry.

44:16.170 --> 44:18.510
- Just...
- No, I... [exhales]

44:18.710 --> 44:20.240
I know you mean well.

44:22.240 --> 44:25.660
But time and time again you've
made clear what matters to you.

44:28.790 --> 44:30.330
It ain't me.

44:31.330 --> 44:33.540
[inhales]

44:41.760 --> 44:43.760
[indistinct shouting]

44:53.940 --> 44:55.760
<i>[Anrep] When I learned</i>
<i>that a public servant</i>

44:55.960 --> 44:58.380
was to be executed,
a public servant

44:58.580 --> 45:01.260
who had done nothing but foster
goodwill between our nations,

45:01.460 --> 45:03.390
I couldn't simply stand by.

45:03.590 --> 45:06.310
Your government has lost
too many good men already.

45:06.510 --> 45:08.480
[Winetrout] Yes,
uh, please accept

45:08.680 --> 45:11.150
my sincerest apologies,
Mr. Millworthy.

45:11.350 --> 45:13.110
You are cleared of all charges.

45:13.310 --> 45:16.070
So, I-I'm free to go?

45:16.270 --> 45:18.320
Ah, yes, on that subject,
we were hoping...

45:18.520 --> 45:20.700
There will, of course,
be a proper investigation

45:20.900 --> 45:22.820
into Mad Jonah's
little reign of terror.

45:23.020 --> 45:26.660
But in the meantime, sir,
frankly, we need you.

45:26.860 --> 45:28.250
We'd like to invite you
to be part

45:28.450 --> 45:30.460
of an interim governing
authority we are establishing.

45:30.660 --> 45:33.630
Ah, well, gentlemen, thank you
so much for the very kind offer,

45:33.830 --> 45:36.340
but if there is one thing
the stage has taught me,

45:36.540 --> 45:39.090
it's knowing
when to make my bow.

45:39.290 --> 45:40.300
Timing is everything.

45:40.500 --> 45:43.860
So, good luck to you all.

45:46.990 --> 45:48.320
[sighing]

45:56.290 --> 45:58.460
[Vir] If you'll forgive
the intrusion...

46:00.300 --> 46:02.160
...Mr. Millworthy.

46:02.360 --> 46:04.120
I know what it is
to cheat death.

46:04.320 --> 46:05.870
Major Vir, I'm very tired.

46:06.070 --> 46:08.160
Nothing you say
could make me stay.

46:08.360 --> 46:11.000
The Burgue is our chief ally,
Mr. Millworthy,

46:11.200 --> 46:12.580
but its government is in chaos.

46:12.780 --> 46:14.500
The men back there are fools.

46:14.700 --> 46:16.920
Petty rivals ready
to tear each other apart.

46:17.120 --> 46:21.970
You are a man of integrity
in a nest of vipers.

46:22.170 --> 46:24.680
You are a man with a clear head.

46:24.880 --> 46:26.930
Yes, I-I'd prefer
to keep that on my shoulders.

46:27.130 --> 46:29.720
Of course. Nobody would
blame you for walking away.

46:29.920 --> 46:32.870
Especially with all
the talk of reprisals.

46:33.950 --> 46:35.650
Reprisals?

46:35.850 --> 46:38.360
For the murder
of the chancellor.

46:38.560 --> 46:40.610
The faefolk of the Row
have harbored terrorists.

46:40.810 --> 46:42.610
There will, of course,
be consequences.

46:42.810 --> 46:45.070
- I assumed you had heard.
- Uh, well...

46:45.270 --> 46:48.160
- No, as a matter of fact,
I haven't.
- Ah.

46:48.360 --> 46:50.500
Well, what was a minority
of your citizens

46:50.700 --> 46:53.790
calling for open warfare
against the faefolk

46:53.990 --> 46:56.250
seems now to be
the majority view.

46:56.450 --> 47:00.630
- Well, I...
- I hear that, uh, Carnival Row

47:00.830 --> 47:03.650
may be razed to the ground.

47:06.690 --> 47:08.700
Obliterated.

47:10.450 --> 47:13.240
No. No, surely not.

47:14.540 --> 47:17.810
While my government
has no qualms in principle,

47:18.010 --> 47:20.730
we are already
fighting one civil war.

47:20.930 --> 47:23.280
We would prefer not
to have our chief ally

47:23.480 --> 47:25.880
bogged down in their own.

47:29.510 --> 47:32.700
You understand what happens,
Mr. Millworthy,

47:32.900 --> 47:36.890
when good men stand by
and do nothing.

47:41.350 --> 47:42.980
Yes.

47:45.440 --> 47:47.280
Yes, I do.

47:51.450 --> 47:53.280
[door shuts]

47:56.160 --> 47:57.580
[Berwick] Here.

48:04.250 --> 48:06.820
Talk about bad timing.

48:07.020 --> 48:09.530
I know you came for Vignette.

48:09.730 --> 48:11.870
You had nothing to do
with the Sparas.

48:12.070 --> 48:14.330
Even the sarge can see that.

48:14.530 --> 48:15.750
How do you know?

48:15.950 --> 48:19.330
Well, those men you ambushed
for their uniforms.

48:19.530 --> 48:22.380
Lixir-dipped darts?

48:22.580 --> 48:25.220
You didn't want to see
your fellow officers get hurt.

48:25.410 --> 48:29.030
Makes no sense you'd be part
of some bloodbath.

48:30.490 --> 48:32.140
Tell that to the warden.

48:32.340 --> 48:34.850
Sarge is going over
the warden's head.

48:35.050 --> 48:37.440
We need your help
to catch this thing.

48:37.640 --> 48:40.190
[exhales]

48:40.390 --> 48:42.360
Even if I wanted to,

48:42.560 --> 48:44.360
it's a shapeshifter,
for fuck's sake.

48:44.560 --> 48:46.440
It could be anyone.

48:46.640 --> 48:48.110
- B-But the murders...
- Are not connected.

48:48.310 --> 48:50.740
There's nothing to go on.

48:50.940 --> 48:53.830
With all due respect, Inspector,

48:54.030 --> 48:56.000
I reckon you're wrong
about that.

48:56.200 --> 48:57.410
Think about it.

48:57.610 --> 48:59.620
The murdered lieutenant's
body was staged

48:59.820 --> 49:02.170
in a way that pointed
a finger at the Pix.

49:02.370 --> 49:04.590
Then the two Black Raven
were staged in a way

49:04.790 --> 49:07.590
that pointed a finger
right back at the Burgue.

49:07.790 --> 49:10.890
And last night, our fae-hating
chancellor is murdered

49:11.090 --> 49:15.470
and angry fae prisoners
set loose to wreak havoc.

49:15.670 --> 49:17.480
It's like every murder was
designed to stir up trouble

49:17.680 --> 49:19.100
between humans and fae.

49:19.300 --> 49:22.810
I watched Sparases burn alive,
Berwick.

49:23.010 --> 49:28.030
In a war that saw humans
slice up their homeland

49:28.230 --> 49:31.910
and profit from the pieces.

49:32.110 --> 49:34.370
It's no wonder
they want to kill us.

49:34.570 --> 49:35.580
Keep your voice down.

49:35.780 --> 49:37.580
That monster gutted
our chancellor.

49:37.780 --> 49:40.170
He's the real monster. Him.

49:40.360 --> 49:42.130
And all men like him,

49:42.320 --> 49:44.980
who oppress the fae.

49:46.480 --> 49:48.860
Like me.

49:49.940 --> 49:51.570
Why are you talking like this?

49:56.570 --> 49:58.810
Do us a favor, Berwick.

49:59.010 --> 50:00.980
Fuck off.

50:01.180 --> 50:03.120
Guard!

50:10.750 --> 50:12.590
[door opens]

50:15.260 --> 50:17.200
[grunts softly]

50:17.400 --> 50:19.050
Thanks.

50:22.560 --> 50:23.770
[sighs]

50:26.520 --> 50:29.630
You have something to say? Hmm?

50:29.830 --> 50:32.840
Just wondering what people
see in you. That's all.

50:33.040 --> 50:34.470
Hmm. Who?

50:34.670 --> 50:36.550
Everybody I care about.

50:36.750 --> 50:38.390
You mean Philo.

50:38.590 --> 50:41.060
Unless you and Tourmaline
have become friends?

50:41.260 --> 50:42.690
She's been nice to me.

50:42.890 --> 50:44.850
Not many people
have been nice to me.

50:45.050 --> 50:47.820
- Hmm, I wonder why.
- You wrecked Philo's life.

50:48.020 --> 50:49.940
The poor bastard threw it
all away because of you.

50:50.140 --> 50:51.950
Are you gonna
wreck hers as well?

50:52.140 --> 50:53.610
I don't know.

50:53.810 --> 50:56.320
- It's between me and her.
- [chuckles]

50:56.520 --> 50:59.120
Yeah.

50:59.320 --> 51:01.410
You're right.

51:01.610 --> 51:02.760
Sorry.

51:08.270 --> 51:10.590
How's the stew?

51:10.790 --> 51:13.470
I've always been a fan
of Tourmaline's cooking.

51:13.670 --> 51:15.940
Amongst other things, of course.

51:19.450 --> 51:21.370
Actually, I made it.

51:22.950 --> 51:24.160
You like mauro?

51:25.450 --> 51:28.710
[laughs] Calm down.

51:30.080 --> 51:32.740
It's a joke.

51:32.940 --> 51:35.780
She needs to leave, Darius.

51:35.980 --> 51:40.430
If you really care
about her, help me.

51:55.400 --> 51:57.240
You got visitors.

52:00.610 --> 52:03.350
Come back for another round,
have you?

52:03.550 --> 52:05.770
We're not here for you, Marrok.

52:05.970 --> 52:07.540
Kaine?

52:10.620 --> 52:12.750
[Kaine] Vini.

52:20.840 --> 52:22.330
Thank the gods.

52:22.530 --> 52:25.210
- We came to rescue you.
- You fool.

52:25.400 --> 52:27.960
- [Phaedra] You're a sight.
- How did you get out?

52:28.160 --> 52:30.460
[Kaine] The guards had us,

52:30.660 --> 52:32.210
but they started fighting
the other prisoners, and...

52:32.410 --> 52:34.170
I saw my chance.

52:34.370 --> 52:36.010
- But Philo...
- Philo can't fly.

52:36.210 --> 52:37.550
So you had to leave him behind?

52:37.750 --> 52:38.970
- Real tragedy.
- [whistle blows]

52:39.170 --> 52:40.300
- I'm sorry.
- [man shouting]

52:40.500 --> 52:41.570
Shit, come on.

52:43.410 --> 52:44.720
[whistles blowing]

52:44.920 --> 52:46.490
- [Kaine] Fuck.
- [distant shouting]

52:52.830 --> 52:55.110
Vini, everything just changed.

52:55.310 --> 52:58.700
Those prisoners that got out,
they've not been idle.

52:58.900 --> 53:01.200
There are plans, Vini.
Big plans.

53:01.400 --> 53:02.740
[shushes]

53:02.940 --> 53:04.330
Not here.

53:04.530 --> 53:06.250
That Marrok can hear us.

53:06.450 --> 53:08.710
And he might not be
the only one.

53:08.910 --> 53:11.880
We moved the hideout. Come on.

53:12.080 --> 53:15.020
- I-I...
- What's the matter?

53:16.060 --> 53:17.550
I think I'm done.

53:17.750 --> 53:19.930
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

53:20.130 --> 53:22.100
With the fight,
with all of this, I just...

53:22.290 --> 53:24.310
I just can't anymore.

53:24.510 --> 53:26.770
- She's gone mad.
- No, Vini.

53:26.970 --> 53:28.850
Vini, this is the moment
we've been waiting for.

53:29.050 --> 53:30.480
We're gonna tear down that wire.

53:30.680 --> 53:32.520
Good. And I really hope you do.

53:32.720 --> 53:35.480
I just... You're gonna have
to do it without me.

53:35.680 --> 53:37.110
[Phaedra] Why?

53:37.310 --> 53:38.820
Have you got something
more important to do?

53:39.020 --> 53:40.410
I made a promise to someone.

53:40.600 --> 53:43.780
Vini, you're the best of us.

53:43.980 --> 53:46.430
You need to be a part
of what's coming.

53:48.100 --> 53:51.520
I'm out. I'm sorry.

53:53.730 --> 53:55.800
Yeah.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.310
We're sorry, too.

54:08.070 --> 54:09.640
Is it true?

54:09.840 --> 54:11.540
You sent them away?

54:15.960 --> 54:19.420
You are what really
matters to me.

54:27.180 --> 54:29.660
So can we please
get you out of here?

54:29.860 --> 54:31.830
Please?

54:32.030 --> 54:33.830
- Yes?
- Yes.

54:34.030 --> 54:35.600
- [both laugh]
- Yes.

54:42.650 --> 54:44.360
[keys rattle]

54:47.150 --> 54:48.990
On your feet.

54:52.030 --> 54:54.650
Back for more?

54:54.850 --> 54:57.190
[Dombey] Rycroft Philostrate,

54:57.390 --> 55:02.070
you will be remanded into police
custody on one condition:

55:02.270 --> 55:05.530
you help us catch
this Critch monster.

55:05.730 --> 55:07.910
Or you can stay here and rot.

Tell them whatever

Just get us the fuck
out of here.

What will it be, Philostrate?

55:45.590 --> 55:48.030
All right.

55:48.230 --> 55:49.840
I'll help.
