What's up, home cooks? Y'all ready?

01:15.075 --> 01:16.409
-Yeah.
-You getting hype?

01:16.476 --> 01:17.610
-Ow!

01:17.677 --> 01:18.678
There you go.

01:20.346 --> 01:22.048
Welcome to <i>Cook at all Costs.</i>

01:22.115 --> 01:25.051
Minhthy, Lucas, Smita,
in this first round,

01:25.118 --> 01:27.153
you'll be making a dish
in any way you like,

01:27.220 --> 01:30.423
using ingredients that are being prepared
in the back pantry

01:30.490 --> 01:32.325
by our guest chef and judge.

01:32.992 --> 01:36.629
She made waves working in some
of the world's most renowned restaurants,

01:36.696 --> 01:39.532
known for integrating
global flavors and techniques

01:39.599 --> 01:41.835
with her bold and inventive style,

01:41.901 --> 01:43.803
Chef Nyesha Arrington.

01:43.870 --> 01:45.438
-Ooh!

01:46.139 --> 01:48.641
Cooking for Chef Arrington
is really intimidating

01:48.708 --> 01:50.810
since she's such a world-renowned chef.

01:50.877 --> 01:52.579
So I'm a little bit nervous,

01:52.645 --> 01:54.114
but I'm ready to have some fun.

01:54.180 --> 01:57.450
All right, Chef Arrington,
send out those boxes.

02:04.290 --> 02:05.325
"Surprise."

02:05.391 --> 02:08.228
You'll start by blind bidding
on these three ingredient boxes

02:08.294 --> 02:10.930
using your bank of $25,000.

02:12.332 --> 02:15.101
Remember, whoever wins
the competition goes home

02:15.168 --> 02:17.270
with all the cash left in their bank.

02:17.337 --> 02:19.305
Please lock in your bids now.

02:22.275 --> 02:24.110
I really want the Surprise Box.

02:24.177 --> 02:26.613
I love to experiment, I love to create,

02:26.679 --> 02:28.281
and I'm up for the challenge.

02:29.749 --> 02:32.018
I want the Spend Box
because I want to work

02:32.085 --> 02:33.987
with some more quality ingredients,

02:34.053 --> 02:36.122
so it's a necessary sort of evil

02:36.189 --> 02:38.491
to spend a lot of money
to get what I want.

02:39.259 --> 02:41.961
All right. Minhthy,
let's take a look at your bid.

02:42.028 --> 02:43.396
$3,000.

02:43.463 --> 02:44.597
Lucas.

02:45.098 --> 02:46.032
Five grand.

02:46.099 --> 02:47.000
We're going big.

02:47.066 --> 02:48.234
-Going big. Okay.
-Yeah.

02:48.301 --> 02:49.169
Smita.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.471
$3,800.

02:51.538 --> 02:55.375
Lucas, you have the highest bid,
which means you get the Spend Box.

02:55.441 --> 02:57.210
Minhthy, you have the lowest bid,

02:57.277 --> 02:59.078
which means you get the Save Box.

02:59.679 --> 03:01.814
And Smita, you get a Surprise.

03:01.881 --> 03:03.783
Yay! Love surprises.

03:05.351 --> 03:08.188
You have 45 minutes
to make the best dish

03:08.254 --> 03:10.256
using the ingredients
from the box you just bought.

03:10.323 --> 03:13.726
And watch out, because more upgrades
will be coming down the line

03:13.793 --> 03:15.428
to help you improve your dishes.

03:16.596 --> 03:18.898
Home cooks,
are you ready to cook at all costs?

03:18.965 --> 03:20.066
-Ready!
-Yes!

03:20.133 --> 03:21.034
We're ready.

03:21.100 --> 03:23.970
All right, good,
'cause your time starts now.

03:24.037 --> 03:24.871
Go!

03:29.709 --> 03:31.344
Okay.

03:32.946 --> 03:35.381
What do we have?
We got some sherry vinegar,

03:35.448 --> 03:37.917
white beans, phyllo pastry,

03:37.984 --> 03:40.353
some shallots,
and some venison tenderloin.

03:40.420 --> 03:42.121
Okay, okay.

03:42.188 --> 03:44.724
I wanted the Spend Box
with quality ingredients,

03:44.791 --> 03:47.827
you know, a little more elevated
or bougie, but I've never cooked

03:47.894 --> 03:50.830
with venison or juniper berries.

03:50.897 --> 03:53.833
Let me think, let me think.
Put some of these over here.

03:53.900 --> 03:56.302
What in the world am I gonna do
with all of these together?

03:56.369 --> 03:58.504
I… I'm stumped.

03:58.571 --> 04:00.139
Canned eggplants.

04:00.206 --> 04:01.808
I open the Save Box.

04:01.874 --> 04:03.977
I have pickled pearl onions,

04:04.043 --> 04:05.211
shredded carrots,

04:05.278 --> 04:07.747
canned eggplant, and pie shell.

04:08.314 --> 04:09.549
Rabbit.

04:10.250 --> 04:14.687
I see this rabbit,
and, man, my stomach just drops.

04:15.555 --> 04:19.792
I don't know how to cook rabbit.
I'm not really happy with the Save Box.

04:21.561 --> 04:23.596
Some baby carrots.

04:23.663 --> 04:25.798
"Corn rings." That's interesting.

04:25.865 --> 04:27.500
In the Surprise Box,

04:27.567 --> 04:29.902
I have onion rings, carrots,

04:29.969 --> 04:31.437
crescent rolls, celeriac,

04:31.504 --> 04:32.772
canned chickpeas, and…

04:32.839 --> 04:34.607
Oh, my gosh!

04:34.674 --> 04:36.509
"Ostrich loin."

04:36.576 --> 04:39.679
I've never cooked with ostrich before.
I've never tasted it before.

04:39.746 --> 04:41.614
I'm very nervous.

04:41.681 --> 04:43.850
Looks like we have a loin challenge.

04:43.916 --> 04:46.185
The tender cut of meat from the lower back

04:46.686 --> 04:48.454
and some pastry too.

04:48.521 --> 04:53.293
Minhthy, you have the humble rabbit loin
and a pie shell in the Save Box.

04:53.359 --> 04:55.361
Lucas, with the Spend Box,

04:55.428 --> 04:58.698
you've got the high-end venison loin
with the phyllo pastry.

04:58.765 --> 05:00.366
-And, Smita, surprise!

05:00.433 --> 05:03.569
You have
the ostrich loin and, uh, crescent rolls.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.538
You said you like surprises.

05:05.605 --> 05:06.939
I do.

05:07.006 --> 05:08.941
What am I going to do with this?

05:09.008 --> 05:10.276
I'm kind of freaking out.

05:12.445 --> 05:14.981
I just have no flipping idea
what I'm gonna do with all this.

05:15.048 --> 05:18.584
Right now, I have absolutely no idea
what I'm doing,

05:18.651 --> 05:20.620
and so I'm prepping all of my ingredients

05:20.687 --> 05:25.625
making sure that, uh, everything's ready
for when I actually do have a plan.

05:25.692 --> 05:26.726
I don't know.

05:26.793 --> 05:29.629
I'm an academic, I'm a sessional lecturer
at University of Toronto.

05:29.696 --> 05:31.197
I read a lot and I write a lot,

05:31.264 --> 05:33.299
so I love cooking
'cause it gets me out of my head.

05:33.366 --> 05:35.001
Cooking is my time for myself.

05:35.068 --> 05:38.104
If I had my way, it'd be two
or three hours to cook any dish,

05:38.171 --> 05:39.405
but time is running out.

05:39.472 --> 05:41.774
I need to figure out
what exactly I'm going to do.

05:41.841 --> 05:43.509
You know what?
I'm just going to go for it.

05:43.576 --> 05:44.944
I have the phyllo pastry,

05:45.011 --> 05:48.514
and so I'm thinking to myself
I can make a little venison pot pie.

05:48.581 --> 05:50.750
So I'm blending white beans,

05:50.817 --> 05:53.052
hot Italian spread, some sautéed shallots

05:53.119 --> 05:56.556
to use as the sauce for this pot pie.

05:56.622 --> 05:57.790
Blend, blend, blend.

05:57.857 --> 05:59.892
And I'm going to start cooking my venison.

05:59.959 --> 06:02.061
Lucas, have you cooked venison before?

06:02.128 --> 06:04.797
Uh, it's like we're playing
a game of Never Have I Ever. No.

06:04.864 --> 06:06.833
I've never cooked rabbit,
so don't worry about it.

06:06.899 --> 06:08.267
This is gonna be interesting.

06:08.334 --> 06:13.239
What I really love about cooking is
it reconnects me back to my culture.

06:13.306 --> 06:17.744
My mom immigrated here from Vietnam.
I grew up watching her cook.

06:17.810 --> 06:21.147
Later in life, when I learned how to cook,
I felt a lot closer to her

06:21.214 --> 06:22.515
and closer to my family.

06:22.582 --> 06:27.053
I think I'm going to make
some sort of pot pie variation.

06:27.120 --> 06:30.656
As soon as I see the pie shell,
I know that I can work with this.

06:30.723 --> 06:33.259
I'm going to try to create
some sort of filling here.

06:33.326 --> 06:35.862
I guess I'm going to make rabbit pot pie.

06:35.928 --> 06:37.964
I'm taking the canned eggplant,

06:38.030 --> 06:40.500
and then I'm adding some carrot,

06:40.566 --> 06:43.202
pickled pearl onions,
to make a really great filling.

06:44.170 --> 06:46.172
I've never really cooked rabbit before,

06:46.239 --> 06:48.808
but I'm having a melodrama in my head

06:48.875 --> 06:50.109
looking at this rabbit.

06:50.176 --> 06:54.614
I have no desire for it
to be in my dish.

06:57.984 --> 06:58.885
Whoo! What's up, Chef?

06:58.951 --> 07:01.053
-What's up?
-Ooh, what are you working on here?

07:01.120 --> 07:03.923
I'm actually making
the most delicious cheese board.

07:03.990 --> 07:05.658
-This is the loin challenge.
-Yes.

07:05.725 --> 07:09.862
This cheese board makes sense
because loin doesn't have a lot of fat.

07:09.929 --> 07:11.464
You're gonna give a fat upgrade here.

07:11.531 --> 07:13.199
-Four different types.
-Exactly.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.134
So you're known as a game expert?

07:15.201 --> 07:18.171
I do love to cook game meats,
and I think it's really important,

07:18.237 --> 07:20.940
especially when working with game meats,
and loin in particular…

07:21.007 --> 07:23.609
I mean, there's only, you know,
two loins going down the back,

07:23.676 --> 07:26.279
and they tend to be not so fatty and rich.

07:26.345 --> 07:28.714
-Temperature control's really important.
-Of course.

07:28.781 --> 07:32.118
So maybe you're using something
that is more fatty to go on the dish.

07:32.185 --> 07:35.755
It's going to sort of balance out
that lean meat and then the richness.

07:35.822 --> 07:37.857
-Yeah. Let's hope they can do that.
-Yes.

07:37.924 --> 07:40.092
Send the upgrade out.
I'll go check on the home cooks.

07:40.159 --> 07:41.360
-Excellent.
See you in a bit.

07:41.427 --> 07:42.261
See ya!

07:46.332 --> 07:50.903
For the ostrich, I think
I'm going to make a little… steak.

07:50.970 --> 07:52.905
I was born and raised in India.

07:52.972 --> 07:55.475
I learned cooking from my grandmother.

07:55.541 --> 07:58.711
She taught me how to pick the vegetables,
how to clean them, cut them,

07:58.778 --> 08:00.346
how to mill your own flour.

08:00.413 --> 08:05.418
Everything was from scratch,
so that kind of transforms how I cook.

08:05.485 --> 08:08.888
So I want to represent my country,
I want to win,

08:08.955 --> 08:11.724
but I have never cooked
with ostrich before.

08:11.791 --> 08:13.860
I don't know
what's the right way to cook it,

08:13.926 --> 08:19.131
but I think just cook it like a steak
and hope it comes out nice.

08:19.198 --> 08:21.601
Ooh, beautiful bread.

08:21.667 --> 08:24.470
I want to create a nice flatbread
with the crescent rolls.

08:24.537 --> 08:28.741
So I'm making ostrich flatbread
topped with celeriac,

08:28.808 --> 08:32.845
but I would love something
to add a nice color to finish my dish.

08:40.753 --> 08:41.921
What do we have here?

08:41.988 --> 08:44.023
Flashing red lights. Auction time!

08:48.661 --> 08:52.565
All right, home cooks,
first item up for auction is…

08:52.632 --> 08:54.734
boneless, skinless chicken breasts.

08:55.735 --> 08:58.571
Wait till I give the price
before you buzz.

08:58.638 --> 09:00.072
Very eager.

09:00.139 --> 09:02.909
I have rabbit,
and I don't want to use it.

09:02.975 --> 09:06.345
I will literally jump my station
to get that chicken.

09:06.412 --> 09:09.815
Home cooks,
this classic protein is gonna cost you.

09:09.882 --> 09:11.517
I'm starting the bidding at $2,000.

09:12.485 --> 09:15.721
$2,000 going once, going twice…

09:15.788 --> 09:19.125
Sold to Minhthy!
Go ahead and switch up your protein.

09:19.191 --> 09:20.826
Yay.

09:20.893 --> 09:22.028
Bye-bye, bunny.

09:23.095 --> 09:25.698
All right, the next item
up for auction is…

09:25.765 --> 09:27.600
some Tuscan kale.

09:27.667 --> 09:28.534
It's so delicious.

09:28.601 --> 09:31.037
Brightens, freshens up,
balances your dishes.

09:31.103 --> 09:34.273
I love kale.
It gives a nice balance to the meats,

09:34.340 --> 09:36.342
and I want that really bad.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.277
Start the bidding at $600.

09:39.445 --> 09:42.582
$600 going once, going twice…

09:42.648 --> 09:44.050
Sold to Smita!

09:44.650 --> 09:46.819
-Take it! Delicious kale.
-Oh, thank you.

09:49.822 --> 09:52.525
Home cooks, final item up for auction is…

09:52.592 --> 09:54.627
a beautiful cheese board.

09:54.694 --> 09:56.662
Three cow's milk, one goat.

09:56.729 --> 09:59.298
I see the cheese. I think to myself,
"This could add," you know,

09:59.365 --> 10:01.667
"a little <i>je ne sais quoi</i> to the pot pie."

10:02.468 --> 10:04.437
I don't care about the cheese.

10:04.503 --> 10:08.474
I want the nuts to make a nice sauce
for my ostrich flatbread.

10:08.541 --> 10:10.776
I'll start the bidding at $1,000.

10:10.843 --> 10:12.044
-Do I have $1,200?

10:12.111 --> 10:13.412
-$1,400?

10:13.479 --> 10:15.114
-Do I have 1,600?

10:15.181 --> 10:16.582
-We got a bidding war!

10:16.649 --> 10:18.050
Smita, cut it out!

10:18.117 --> 10:20.286
-$1,800. $2,000.

10:20.353 --> 10:21.854
-Do I have 25?

10:21.921 --> 10:23.122
-$3,000.

10:23.189 --> 10:24.290
-$3,500.

10:24.357 --> 10:25.324
Do I hear $4,000?

10:26.258 --> 10:29.862
$3,500 going once, $3,500 going twice…

10:29.929 --> 10:32.865
-Sold to Lucas for $3,500.
-Go, Lucas.

10:32.932 --> 10:34.500
-Thanks a lot.

10:34.567 --> 10:36.135
Look. You got all of that.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.404
Man, he really wanted that bad.

10:38.471 --> 10:39.805
How'd you know?

10:39.872 --> 10:42.041
What are you gonna do
with all that cheese, huh?

10:42.108 --> 10:43.342
Uh, the cheese is a game changer

10:43.409 --> 10:45.811
because it actually makes
my recipe come together.

10:45.878 --> 10:48.881
The cheese is going to add
an extra layer of flavor to my pot pie.

10:48.948 --> 10:53.586
In my ramekin, I'm layering venison,
then the white bean and pepper sauce,

10:53.653 --> 10:54.654
the cheese,

10:54.720 --> 10:56.856
and then I put on top, my phyllo pastry.

10:56.922 --> 10:58.457
This looks like a mess!

11:00.860 --> 11:03.729
Whoo! Ticktock.
Twenty minutes left, home cooks!

11:03.796 --> 11:05.831
I changed out
the rabbit to get chicken,

11:05.898 --> 11:07.933
which I think
is a little bit easier to use.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.571
I'm continuing to keep my pot pie strategy
that I already had,

11:12.638 --> 11:16.475
and just replacing that protein,
adding the chicken instead.

11:19.645 --> 11:21.447
So I'm going to sauté the kale.

11:22.014 --> 11:23.482
I have a Tuscan kale,

11:23.549 --> 11:26.919
so I'm putting
the celeriac and kale together.

11:26.986 --> 11:30.256
-Has anybody ever cooked a ostrich before?
-No.

11:31.390 --> 11:33.926
Ostrich,
I've never tasted or cooked with it,

11:33.993 --> 11:37.196
and so I want to add
some red pepper sauce to it,

11:37.263 --> 11:39.932
because that's how, usually, I cook meats.

11:39.999 --> 11:43.869
But I don't know
how long the ostrich needs to get cooked,

11:43.936 --> 11:47.373
so I could really use some extra help.

11:52.878 --> 11:56.449
Oh! What do we got here?
A surprise auction?

11:56.515 --> 11:58.184
It better be good for me.

11:59.118 --> 12:00.953
It's a chef's knife
with my name on it.

12:01.020 --> 12:03.189
The winner of this auction

12:03.255 --> 12:06.625
will get three minutes
of my time with you,

12:06.692 --> 12:08.961
tasting, prepping, helping,
whatever you need.

12:09.028 --> 12:10.062
Oh, wow.

12:10.129 --> 12:14.734
Chef Jordan would be a great help,
and I really want to get his advice.

12:15.301 --> 12:18.304
To work with Chef Jordan
would be really awesome.

12:18.370 --> 12:20.406
He's a really talented cook.

12:20.473 --> 12:22.541
-We'll start the bidding at $800.

12:22.608 --> 12:23.976
-$1,000.

12:24.043 --> 12:25.344
-$1,200?

12:25.411 --> 12:26.679
-$1,500.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.080
-$1,800.

12:28.147 --> 12:30.116
Lucas, I don't know
what I did to offend you,

12:30.182 --> 12:31.650
but, all right, no problem.

12:31.717 --> 12:35.087
Jordan, it's not personal.
I spent far too much money on my<i> fromage.</i>

12:35.154 --> 12:36.489
-$2,000.

12:36.555 --> 12:38.257
Do I have 25? Can I fetch 25?

12:39.425 --> 12:41.060
-Do I have $3,000?

12:41.127 --> 12:42.628
Do I have $4,000?

12:42.695 --> 12:45.364
At this point,
it's a little bit too rich for my blood.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.299
Inflation's high.

12:47.366 --> 12:49.835
-Sold!
-Thank you.

12:49.902 --> 12:51.270
-You ready?
-Yes.

12:51.337 --> 12:54.640
I just paid $3,000
for three minutes with Chef Jordan,

12:54.707 --> 12:56.175
so I'm putting him to work.

12:56.242 --> 12:58.144
I am your sous-chef.
What do you need, Chef?

12:58.210 --> 12:59.278
The ostrich.

12:59.345 --> 13:01.313
-You can actually serve this rare.
-Oh, okay.

13:01.380 --> 13:02.948
-Did you season it already?
-Yes.

13:03.015 --> 13:03.949
Okay, good.

13:04.016 --> 13:06.619
-Perfect, what else do you need?
-I have some celeriac and kale.

13:06.685 --> 13:09.822
-Did you taste this yet? You seasoned it?
-I did. It's a little salty for me.

13:09.889 --> 13:10.756
Okay, hold on.

13:10.823 --> 13:12.658
-Need some pepper. Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

13:12.725 --> 13:15.094
Okay, there you go.
It actually needs a little bit more salt.

13:15.161 --> 13:16.495
-It does? Oh.
-Mm-hmm.

13:16.562 --> 13:19.498
As soon as Chef Jordan
starts to cook with me,

13:19.565 --> 13:21.433
suddenly, I feel very calm.

13:21.500 --> 13:23.169
-You want me to shred the carrots?
-Yep.

13:23.235 --> 13:26.138
Yes, Chef, shredding carrots. You want 'em
in rounds? You want 'em long?

13:26.205 --> 13:27.606
-Yeah. Like-- Like--
-Got it.

13:29.475 --> 13:33.112
Chef Jordan is a great help
and incredible cook.

13:33.179 --> 13:35.714
-Okay, you did it. Okay.
-Yes. Thank you.

13:35.781 --> 13:37.616
-Keep an eye on the oven, okay?
-Oh, yes.

13:39.451 --> 13:41.320
Home cooks,
you have five minutes left!

13:41.387 --> 13:45.758
My pot pie, it's rustic, right?
So I feel okay with it aesthetically.

13:45.825 --> 13:49.662
However, the taste itself,
I'm feeling entirely nervous.

13:49.728 --> 13:51.864
What if these ingredients
don't go well together?

13:54.633 --> 13:57.803
I think the Save Box really limited me.
I wish I had something

13:57.870 --> 14:02.208
to kind of give it a little bit more oomph
in that presentation.

14:02.274 --> 14:04.610
I don't think
I'll be going for the Save Box again.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.512
Sixty seconds left!

14:06.579 --> 14:07.479
Oh, wow.

14:07.546 --> 14:12.084
I'm feeling more confident about my dish
after Chef Jordan helped me,

14:12.151 --> 14:15.287
but I hope the ostrich, it's edible.

14:15.354 --> 14:18.157
Ten, nine, eight,

14:18.224 --> 14:19.258
-seven…

14:19.325 --> 14:22.828
…six, five, four, three,

14:22.895 --> 14:24.864
-two, one.

14:25.431 --> 14:28.267
-Good job, home cooks! Good job.

14:31.670 --> 14:35.241
I'm very nervous.
All I can think about right now is

14:35.307 --> 14:38.344
that Chef Nyesha
is going to taste my food.

14:38.410 --> 14:41.080
And what is she going to say?

14:42.214 --> 14:44.016
-Whoo!
-How was it?

14:44.083 --> 14:45.117
-Really fun.
-Amazing.

14:45.184 --> 14:48.320
-Yeah, yeah, I loved it. How're you doing?
-Ready to get into these dishes.

14:48.387 --> 14:51.857
Okay, this is an ostrich flatbread

14:51.924 --> 14:54.093
topped with sautéed celeriac

14:54.159 --> 14:55.628
and some Tuscan kale.

14:55.694 --> 14:57.763
This is one
of the most vibrant dishes

14:57.830 --> 15:00.032
I've come across.
The colors are singing to me.

15:00.099 --> 15:03.269
It's so interesting to see
that they've used that crescent roll

15:03.335 --> 15:05.604
and made almost this,
like, flatbread situation.

15:05.671 --> 15:06.872
-Yeah.
-It's just lovely.

15:08.340 --> 15:12.478
So this home cook
has never cooked or eaten ostrich ever.

15:12.544 --> 15:14.313
This home cook purchased
my help, actually.

15:14.380 --> 15:16.015
-Wow! Lucky them.

15:16.081 --> 15:17.783
-How'd they do?
-The cook is nice.

15:17.850 --> 15:21.387
I think the ostrich itself
could have used just a touch more salt.

15:21.453 --> 15:23.622
This home cook purchased Tuscan kale.

15:23.689 --> 15:26.392
$600. Do you think
it was a good investment?

15:26.458 --> 15:28.928
I do. I really appreciate the vibrancy

15:28.994 --> 15:31.697
and the green, earthy elements
that are coming in from the kale.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.233
There's a lot of intention,
it feels like, that went into this,

15:34.300 --> 15:35.801
and almost, like, some soul.

15:37.970 --> 15:42.241
Here we have a white bean
and cheese venison pot pie.

15:42.975 --> 15:45.411
Wow, I'm a fan of pot pies.

15:47.212 --> 15:50.282
I really enjoy the texture
coming off of the phyllo.

15:50.349 --> 15:51.550
-Mm-hmm.
-It's very lovely.

15:51.617 --> 15:54.486
-It presents beautifully.
-There's like a rustic elegance to this.

15:56.055 --> 15:59.358
So I'm getting quite lovely heat
coming from this, very nice.

15:59.425 --> 16:02.928
But I'm having a tough time
with the texture of the venison.

16:02.995 --> 16:05.564
Generally, venison should
kind of be enjoyed

16:05.631 --> 16:09.301
a little bit more on the rare side,
so can kind of read a bit tough.

16:09.368 --> 16:12.271
I think the creaminess of the white bean
is helping that out a little bit

16:12.338 --> 16:13.539
by adding some moisture.

16:13.605 --> 16:17.176
This home cook bought
your cheese board upgrade for $3,500.

16:17.242 --> 16:19.478
Interesting choice
to use the cheese.

16:19.545 --> 16:22.114
With the venison, it's not so successful.

16:22.181 --> 16:26.218
There's these big, clunky chunks of cheese
that are overpowering my palate.

16:27.720 --> 16:28.587
So, this dish,

16:28.654 --> 16:30.522
you have a chicken pot pie

16:30.589 --> 16:32.291
with carrots, eggplant,

16:32.358 --> 16:34.126
and cocktail onions.

16:34.193 --> 16:35.127
Wow.

16:35.194 --> 16:38.030
So, in this box, I definitely put rabbit.

16:38.097 --> 16:41.400
Yes. Here's what happened.
The upgrade of chicken came down the line.

16:41.467 --> 16:42.568
They immediately switched.

16:42.634 --> 16:44.603
They didn't like
the gaminess of the rabbit.

16:45.571 --> 16:47.773
There's so much you can do
with rabbit loin.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.975
It's a bummer not to see
that rabbit loin on this dish.

16:50.042 --> 16:52.711
The cocktail onions,
makes sense to use those.

16:52.778 --> 16:54.513
You're almost thinking mirepoix.

16:54.580 --> 16:56.815
-Yeah, with the carrots too. Mm-hmm.
-And the carrots.

16:56.882 --> 17:00.219
I really appreciate
the little squares of the pie dough.

17:00.285 --> 17:01.854
-That's super cute.
-Mm-hmm.

17:01.920 --> 17:04.790
And it's cooked perfectly,
but my eyes are searching

17:04.857 --> 17:06.458
for freshness and greenery,

17:06.525 --> 17:08.494
and I would've just loved
to see some more sauce.

17:10.129 --> 17:13.032
Chef, final question.
Do we have a winning dish?

17:13.098 --> 17:14.266
I have my winner.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.005
Home cooks, it's result time.

17:21.340 --> 17:24.209
The home cook
with the best out-of-the-box dish is…

17:28.414 --> 17:30.516
-Smita.

17:34.520 --> 17:37.790
I am so happy and, yeah, very shocked.

17:37.856 --> 17:40.159
I feel confident now.

17:42.294 --> 17:45.998
Home cooks, your final challenge
is inspired by Chef Arrington.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.434
Whether it's her bulgogi cheeseburgers

17:48.500 --> 17:49.968
or taco lasagna,

17:50.035 --> 17:52.071
she's a master
of combining global cuisines

17:52.137 --> 17:53.972
to create exciting and modern dishes.

17:54.540 --> 17:57.443
So the chef's choice is global mash-up.

17:58.010 --> 17:59.578
Working with ingredient boxes

17:59.645 --> 18:02.147
curated by Chef Arrington,
you'll need to make a dish

18:02.214 --> 18:04.850
inspired by two or more cuisines
from around the world.

18:05.651 --> 18:07.820
Global mash-up really excites me.

18:07.886 --> 18:11.190
I'm from Houston, which is one
of the most diverse cities in the world,

18:11.256 --> 18:12.858
so this is where I'm going to shine.

18:12.925 --> 18:16.028
All right, Chef Arrington,
roll out those boxes.

18:21.066 --> 18:22.835
Home cooks, in this round,

18:22.901 --> 18:24.269
the boxes have set prices.

18:25.637 --> 18:27.873
The Spend Box is $8,000,

18:28.474 --> 18:30.676
the Save Box is $4,000,

18:30.742 --> 18:33.946
and the Surprise Box will cost you $6,000.

18:34.012 --> 18:36.215
Smita, as the winner of round one,

18:36.281 --> 18:39.051
you get to choose
which box you'd like to work with.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.219
Okay.

18:40.285 --> 18:43.422
You also get to assign the other boxes
to your fellow home cooks.

18:43.489 --> 18:44.756
-Oh, no.

18:44.823 --> 18:46.825
Price tags included.

18:47.926 --> 18:51.797
-Which box would you like to buy?
-I would like to buy the Save Box.

18:52.531 --> 18:53.999
I want the Save Box

18:54.066 --> 18:58.103
because I want to save the money
for some upgrades at the auction.

18:58.170 --> 19:00.472
In my mind, I have to take the risk.

19:01.039 --> 19:03.342
So, who would you like
to assign the Spend Box to,

19:03.408 --> 19:05.777
along with its $8,000 price tag?

19:05.844 --> 19:07.446
Can I do eeny meeny miny moe?

19:07.513 --> 19:09.414
Honestly,
you can do whatever you'd like.

19:09.481 --> 19:10.816
-Okay.

19:10.883 --> 19:14.386
I would like to give
the Spend Box to Minhthy.

19:14.953 --> 19:16.488
Thank you. I guess.

19:17.589 --> 19:21.293
I'm really glad I didn't have
to take that Save Box again.

19:21.360 --> 19:24.096
Thank you, Smita,
for giving me that Spend Box.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.197
I'm moving on up.

19:25.764 --> 19:28.300
That means, Lucas,
you've been assigned the Surprise Box.

19:28.367 --> 19:30.836
I didn't want the Save Box
based on last round.

19:30.903 --> 19:34.573
So thank you, Smita. 
That is precisely what I want.

19:35.374 --> 19:39.211
Home cooks, keep an eye on the line
for more upgrades coming your way.

19:39.278 --> 19:41.213
There's 45 minutes on the clock

19:41.280 --> 19:44.183
for you to make
your best global mash-up dish.

19:44.249 --> 19:48.253
The time has come again
to cook at all costs. Go!

19:52.291 --> 19:55.994
I have a watermelon, radicchio…

19:56.061 --> 19:58.096
I'm really excited about this Spend Box.

19:58.664 --> 20:00.065
I see king crab,

20:00.132 --> 20:02.201
I see some clams,

20:02.267 --> 20:04.269
some mangoes, some peppers,

20:04.336 --> 20:05.470
uh, and some roti.

20:06.104 --> 20:06.972
Not bad.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.106
All right. Nice.

20:09.074 --> 20:11.109
Okay, we got a papaya,

20:11.176 --> 20:12.511
steam buns,

20:12.578 --> 20:13.579
oysters.

20:13.645 --> 20:15.147
What is this?

20:15.214 --> 20:17.049
I have this weird, little green thing,

20:17.115 --> 20:18.817
and I have a white little root.

20:18.884 --> 20:20.986
I have no idea what these are.

20:22.387 --> 20:24.823
And surprise, surprise, I see alligator.

20:25.891 --> 20:28.060
Uh, what am I gonna do with alligator?

20:28.126 --> 20:31.563
I have a lot to thank you for,
including alligator meat, Smita.

20:31.630 --> 20:32.931
-What do you have?

20:32.998 --> 20:34.066
Oh, my goodness.

20:34.132 --> 20:36.468
I have the fish sticks.

20:37.102 --> 20:41.106
I chose the Save Box.
I have this frozen fish sticks.

20:41.707 --> 20:43.642
Some pickled peppers,

20:44.409 --> 20:45.844
pita…

20:45.911 --> 20:46.878
and plantains.

20:46.945 --> 20:48.046
Look at that.

20:48.113 --> 20:51.083
How am I going to make sense of all this?

20:51.650 --> 20:52.951
This could be the end of me.

20:53.518 --> 20:57.756
All right, looks like we got
a global mash-up of proteins and breads.

20:57.823 --> 20:59.491
Smita, with the Save Box,

20:59.558 --> 21:01.727
you've got fish sticks and pita.

21:02.794 --> 21:06.465
Minhthy, with the Spend Box,
you have some king crab and roti.

21:06.531 --> 21:10.602
And Lucas, with the Surprise Box,
steam buns and alligator.

21:10.669 --> 21:12.738
-Yeah.
-You got some alligator meat.

21:12.804 --> 21:15.607
That alligator, it's gonna stay
where it is, I think.

21:15.674 --> 21:17.309
I'm not even opening the alligator,

21:17.376 --> 21:20.078
'cause I have zero desire
to figure out how to use it.

21:20.646 --> 21:22.147
We're gonna get these oysters.

21:22.214 --> 21:26.485
I'm relieved I have oysters
because I actually know what these are.

21:27.052 --> 21:30.188
I see the buns, I see the oysters,
I think to myself, "Po' boy."

21:30.255 --> 21:33.759
I'm going to do a quick little batter
and throw them in the deep fryer.

21:33.825 --> 21:34.926
I'm going for the crispy,

21:34.993 --> 21:37.296
I'm going for the crunchy,
and I'm going for the delicious.

21:39.464 --> 21:42.234
When I see the roti,
I know exactly what to do.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.436
I can turn them into tortilla chips.

21:45.137 --> 21:47.906
And then I immediately think nachos.

21:47.973 --> 21:51.143
Kind of bring
that Latin America vibe to it.

21:52.144 --> 21:55.647
And I'm thinking of also giving it
a little bit of that Asian flair,

21:55.714 --> 21:58.016
since, you know,
mangoes are a tropical fruit.

21:58.083 --> 22:00.052
I have these peppers in my box, too.

22:00.118 --> 22:03.288
So I'm making
a Vietnamese king crab nacho.

22:03.355 --> 22:05.357
This is nacho average dish.

22:05.424 --> 22:06.925
Spices would be great.

22:06.992 --> 22:11.396
Could also use, like, a lemon
or something in that citrusy family.

22:13.865 --> 22:15.567
Okay! What do you have here, Chef?

22:15.634 --> 22:17.903
-Hey, hey! What's going on?
-What are you working on?

22:17.969 --> 22:21.840
I'm actually working on
the most delicious yuzu vinaigrette.

22:21.907 --> 22:25.444
Ooh! I mean, already just coming in,
the aromatics just hit you in the face.

22:25.510 --> 22:26.445
Right?

22:26.511 --> 22:29.514
It's obviously big in Japan,
and it'll add that tart, citrus flavor.

22:29.581 --> 22:33.118
Yeah, hopefully, this will add
a little pop to their dishes.

22:33.185 --> 22:35.420
So cool.
All right, Chef, I'm so curious.

22:35.487 --> 22:37.022
-Yes?
-Because I know what you make.

22:37.089 --> 22:40.192
You-- You got bulgogi cheeseburgers,
like, taco lasagna.

22:40.258 --> 22:43.962
What's your strategy when you're fusing
different global cuisines on a plate?

22:44.029 --> 22:47.966
Well, I like to draw from inspirations
from, like, one area of the world

22:48.033 --> 22:49.301
and ingredients from another,

22:49.368 --> 22:51.103
and, like, allow them
to speak to each other.

22:51.169 --> 22:53.505
It's familiar, but it's like new flavors.

22:53.572 --> 22:56.675
Amazing. Okay, well, send that out.
I'm gonna go check on the home cooks.

22:56.742 --> 22:58.377
-See you in a bit.
-Okay. Thank you.

22:59.978 --> 23:02.280
Pita. What do I do with these?

23:02.347 --> 23:06.485
Pita has flour. Pasta is made with flour.

23:06.551 --> 23:10.188
So I think to myself,
"Okay, I can make spaghetti."

23:10.255 --> 23:13.258
So yeah, that's crazy.

23:13.959 --> 23:15.293
Fish sticks.

23:15.360 --> 23:19.898
I'm not a fan of fish sticks,
but it has the perfect breading.

23:19.965 --> 23:23.335
It has the meat inside.
So I'm going to make meatballs.

23:23.402 --> 23:28.206
It's just a creative take
on spaghetti and meatballs.

23:28.273 --> 23:29.241
Okay.

23:29.307 --> 23:32.377
But I really could use some spices
and level this up.

23:38.784 --> 23:41.386
All right, home cooks, the line is moving.

23:41.453 --> 23:43.121
The lights are flashing.

23:43.188 --> 23:44.823
An auction's happening.

23:44.890 --> 23:48.126
Three different spice kits
and a mystery upgrade.

23:48.693 --> 23:49.961
Oh, my God.

23:50.028 --> 23:52.297
An Indian spice kit,

23:52.364 --> 23:54.499
a Caribbean spice kit,

23:54.566 --> 23:56.067
and a Middle Eastern spice kit.

23:56.134 --> 23:59.171
I see the Indian spice kit,
and I'm very happy.

23:59.237 --> 24:04.810
With the right spices, I can even make
the frozen fish sticks taste delicious.

24:04.876 --> 24:07.179
The Indian spice kit has coriander,

24:07.245 --> 24:09.047
cardamom, turmeric, cloves,

24:09.114 --> 24:11.383
Kashmiri pepper, black mustard seed,

24:11.450 --> 24:12.317
and curry powder.

24:12.384 --> 24:14.719
-Bidding start--

24:14.786 --> 24:16.054
Can we all play nice here?

24:16.121 --> 24:18.623
And then we can all just take
our respective spice kits, and go.

24:18.690 --> 24:21.126
-All right, the Indian spice kit.

24:21.193 --> 24:22.928
-Opening bid, $1,000.

24:22.994 --> 24:24.830
Do I have $1,200?

24:25.330 --> 24:28.834
$1,000 going once, $1,000 going twice…

24:28.900 --> 24:30.335
-Sold!

24:30.936 --> 24:32.938
That's going to give
a nice Indian touch

24:33.004 --> 24:35.040
to my spaghetti and meatballs.

24:36.608 --> 24:38.910
Next up,
the Caribbean spice blend,

24:38.977 --> 24:40.245
paprika, nutmeg,

24:40.312 --> 24:41.646
cinnamon, thyme, allspice,

24:41.713 --> 24:43.815
and a lovely Scotch bonnet pepper.

24:43.882 --> 24:46.017
I want the Caribbean spice kit
for my po' boy.

24:46.084 --> 24:49.187
Spices are necessary
to make the entire dish come alive.

24:49.254 --> 24:50.522
Do I have $1,000?

24:50.589 --> 24:52.123
-Ooh. $1,000 going to Lucas.

24:52.190 --> 24:54.459
-$1,200 going to Minhthy.

24:54.526 --> 24:58.563
I want that Scotch bonnet
to give my dish an extra spicy kick.

24:58.630 --> 25:00.565
Do I have $1,500?

25:00.632 --> 25:02.033
-Do I have $2,000?

25:02.100 --> 25:04.436
-$2,000 going to Minhthy.

25:04.503 --> 25:07.606
Minhthy's bidding on my spice kit,
draining my bank account.

25:07.672 --> 25:09.374
Minhthy, we had a deal!

25:09.441 --> 25:10.742
-Stop it.

25:10.809 --> 25:12.544
$2,500 going to Lucas.

25:12.611 --> 25:14.679
-Do I have $3,000?

25:14.746 --> 25:17.315
-Lucas. $3,500 going once…

25:17.382 --> 25:20.252
-You can have it.
-$3,500 going twice…

25:20.318 --> 25:23.054
Sold, sir, for $3,500.

25:23.121 --> 25:26.191
Right now, I have
the least amount of money in the bank,

25:26.258 --> 25:28.660
but if I don't spend, I don't win.

25:28.727 --> 25:31.696
Last but not least,
we have the Middle Eastern spices,

25:31.763 --> 25:35.100
cumin, sumac, saffron, Aleppo pepper.

25:35.166 --> 25:38.136
I see
that there are some peppers in there.

25:38.203 --> 25:41.239
They can add a bit
of a spicy kick to my nachos,

25:41.306 --> 25:42.974
so this is just perfect for my dish.

25:43.041 --> 25:44.676
-The bidding starts $1,000.

25:44.743 --> 25:46.177
Do I have $1,200?

25:48.547 --> 25:51.182
Sold to Minhthy for $1,000!

25:52.284 --> 25:54.886
All right. The final upgrade is…

25:54.953 --> 25:58.156
a yuzu vinaigrette
handmade by Chef Arrington.

25:58.223 --> 26:00.091
I'm so intrigued by this yuzu,

26:00.158 --> 26:03.929
and I'm just thinking of adding
Japanese cuisine into my spaghetti.

26:03.995 --> 26:06.131
-Do I have $800?

26:06.197 --> 26:08.066
I would love
to get this yuzu sauce.

26:08.133 --> 26:11.436
This would bring a little bit of acid
into this dish.

26:11.503 --> 26:12.904
I don't even care what it costs.

26:12.971 --> 26:14.940
-Do I have $1,000?

26:15.006 --> 26:16.207
-$1,000.

26:16.274 --> 26:19.311
$1,200 going to Minhthy. Do I have $1,500?

26:19.377 --> 26:21.112
-Do I have $1,800?

26:21.179 --> 26:22.581
-$2,000.

26:22.647 --> 26:24.516
-I feel a bidding war, baby.

26:24.583 --> 26:25.750
$2,500 going to Minhthy.

26:25.817 --> 26:27.986
-$3,000 going once.

26:28.053 --> 26:29.821
Uh, $3,000 going twice…

26:29.888 --> 26:33.658
And sold to Smita for $3,000.

26:33.725 --> 26:35.727
The most expensive vinaigrette
in the history--

26:35.794 --> 26:37.862
-Oh, perfect.
-…of cooking.

26:38.930 --> 26:40.865
I'm super excited
I get the Caribbean spice kit.

26:40.932 --> 26:43.168
I'm going to incorporate
some of the spices

26:43.234 --> 26:44.603
in my batter for my oysters.

26:45.403 --> 26:48.340
I don't even know
how to cut papaya, to be honest.

26:48.406 --> 26:50.041
I'm also making my salad

26:50.108 --> 26:54.846
using papaya, mystery green fruit,
and some cinnamon, vinegar, and oil.

26:55.547 --> 26:57.315
-What's up, Lucas?
-Oh, not too much.

26:57.382 --> 27:00.118
-What are you making?
-Well, I'm making an oyster po' boy.

27:00.185 --> 27:04.789
It'll be some Thai
and Caribbean-inspired American fusion.

27:04.856 --> 27:06.725
Okay. In terms of the Surprise Box,

27:06.791 --> 27:09.394
is there anything, other than the gator,
you're unfamiliar with?

27:09.461 --> 27:12.163
Uh, that root, this green fruit,
I have no idea what it is.

27:12.230 --> 27:13.298
The root is, uh, eddoe.

27:13.365 --> 27:15.834
-"Eddoe."
-Yeah. And this is called chayote.

27:15.900 --> 27:16.768
-"Chayote."
-Yeah.

27:16.835 --> 27:18.937
It's like a cross between, like, a daikon,

27:19.004 --> 27:20.772
a Granny Smith, and a pear.
It's delicious.

27:20.839 --> 27:23.508
I guess you learn
something new every day.

27:24.075 --> 27:27.112
I'm thinking the eddoe
might be comparable to a potato.

27:27.178 --> 27:30.682
So, I'm thinly slicing it
and throwing it in the deep fryer

27:30.749 --> 27:32.784
to make some… …chips!

27:34.019 --> 27:36.221
Just want a little color in there.

27:36.287 --> 27:38.823
It's starting to taste
and smell like my cooking,

27:38.890 --> 27:40.725
and I am so happy.

27:41.559 --> 27:46.164
I'll have spaghetti out of these pita,
and then I have the meatballs going.

27:46.231 --> 27:48.066
Wanna make a sauce with that.

27:48.133 --> 27:50.001
But I need some sauce.

27:50.068 --> 27:53.405
I do have the pears,
and peppers, and yuzu.

27:55.006 --> 28:00.879
So my dish is going to be incorporating
Italian, Indian, and Japanese cuisine.

28:00.945 --> 28:05.216
And all I'm thinking is
that I have to impress Chef Arrington

28:05.283 --> 28:06.885
and win.

28:08.119 --> 28:12.424
I'm making, like,
a soy Asian sauce for my nachos.

28:13.091 --> 28:15.193
I'm borrowing from my Vietnamese culture

28:15.260 --> 28:19.497
by creating a braising sauce
with the soy sauce, spices, and some sugar

28:19.564 --> 28:22.267
to kind of caramelize
that crab a little bit.

28:24.269 --> 28:25.937
But I'm kicking myself right now,

28:26.004 --> 28:29.307
because I didn't realize
my soy sauce was a sweet soy sauce.

28:29.374 --> 28:32.944
So my braising sauce
is a little bit too sweet,

28:33.011 --> 28:35.013
and it's really hard
to come back from that now.

28:35.947 --> 28:37.882
Home cooks, you have five minutes left!

28:39.884 --> 28:42.187
I'm coating
my oysters in my batter.

28:42.253 --> 28:44.689
-And then I throw them in the deep fryer.

28:45.256 --> 28:47.125
I'm gonna grab the buns
and char them real quick.

28:47.192 --> 28:49.594
I'm putting my steam buns on the grill.

28:49.661 --> 28:53.198
It's absolutely imperative
that these buns come out properly,

28:53.264 --> 28:55.400
because without the buns,
I have no po' boy.

28:57.469 --> 29:00.672
I'm a little bit nervous
about my dish being a little too sweet,

29:00.739 --> 29:03.708
but I think I've created
a really great global mash-up,

29:03.775 --> 29:07.679
and I'm hoping I'm giving Chef Arrington
something that she's never tasted before.

29:08.580 --> 29:11.483
I'm very nervous.
I wanted to create something different,

29:11.549 --> 29:13.485
but all I can think about is

29:13.551 --> 29:16.287
how Chef Arrington is going to say,

29:16.354 --> 29:18.723
"Oh, my gosh. What is this?"

29:18.790 --> 29:20.458
"Who made this?"

29:21.559 --> 29:26.865
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five…

29:26.931 --> 29:28.800
-…four, three,

29:28.867 --> 29:30.201
-two, one.

29:31.002 --> 29:32.437
-Good job, home cooks.

29:32.504 --> 29:34.305
Look at this mess.

29:36.174 --> 29:38.443
I hope Chef Arrington likes my dish

29:38.510 --> 29:42.113
because I could potentially win $7,000.

29:42.180 --> 29:44.649
I want to impress,
then bring home the bacon.

29:47.685 --> 29:49.354
-What up, Chef?
-What up?

29:49.954 --> 29:51.089
Things got spicy in there.

29:51.156 --> 29:53.191
-It looks pretty spicy!

29:53.258 --> 29:54.392
Okay, first up,

29:54.459 --> 29:56.661
this is pita-bread spaghetti

29:56.728 --> 29:58.963
and fish-stick meatballs

29:59.030 --> 30:01.366
in a yuzu, pear, and pepper sauce.

30:01.432 --> 30:04.002
-Wait a minute. Pita spaghetti?
-Pita spaghetti.

30:04.068 --> 30:07.105
-Interesting. Hey, let's go.
-You wanted global mash-up, you got it!

30:08.339 --> 30:11.109
This home cook
is going for Italian in concept,

30:11.176 --> 30:13.845
and then Indian and Japanese in flavor.

30:13.912 --> 30:16.014
Trying to wrap my mind
around pita spaghetti.

30:16.080 --> 30:18.716
And in my mind,
I want it to not work, but it's working.

30:19.818 --> 30:22.821
And what a bold move
to transform a fish stick into a meatball.

30:22.887 --> 30:24.155
That really makes sense.

30:24.222 --> 30:25.223
-And really tasty.
-Yeah.

30:25.290 --> 30:29.227
The Indian spice is
the winning ingredient in this dish,

30:29.294 --> 30:32.463
and it works very well
with the meatball and the pita "noodle."

30:32.530 --> 30:35.400
But then it gets really blown out
by this yuzu vinaigrette.

30:35.466 --> 30:37.035
-Less is more.
-Sometimes.

30:37.101 --> 30:39.337
It's important to have
a cohesiveness in the dish,

30:39.404 --> 30:40.972
even though it's a global mash-up.

30:43.074 --> 30:44.275
All right, Chef,

30:44.342 --> 30:46.744
here you have an oyster po' boy,

30:46.811 --> 30:47.812
with eddoe fries

30:47.879 --> 30:50.381
and a chayote-papaya salad.

30:52.817 --> 30:56.754
So this home cook has taken
American, Caribbean, and hints of Thai.

30:57.322 --> 31:00.124
These oysters are delicious.
The texture is fantastic…

31:00.191 --> 31:01.059
-Right.
-…on the crust.

31:01.125 --> 31:04.329
But I'm getting
a lot of bao-bun-to-oyster ratio.

31:04.395 --> 31:07.665
And bao, it's a lean dough.
You don't wanna grill something like this.

31:07.732 --> 31:09.601
It loves to be steamed
and soft and pillowy.

31:09.667 --> 31:10.768
Pillowy.

31:10.835 --> 31:13.605
The eddoe fries are lacking
a little bit of salt,

31:13.671 --> 31:14.806
and a little bit spicy.

31:14.873 --> 31:17.408
But the salad, I love the colors,

31:17.475 --> 31:20.078
I love the vibrancy,
the freshness coming off of it.

31:20.144 --> 31:23.748
This papaya salad is my favorite thing
to enjoy here on this plate.

31:25.917 --> 31:30.021
Here you have
a Vietnamese Thai king crab nacho.

31:30.755 --> 31:34.959
I mean, king crab nachos, wow,
that sounds super inventive and exciting.

31:38.563 --> 31:40.531
Upon appearance, beautiful, right?

31:40.598 --> 31:42.767
That mango pops, watermelon.

31:42.834 --> 31:44.302
-The chilies look amazing.
-Mm-hmm.

31:44.369 --> 31:46.471
But when I place
the first bite in my mouth,

31:46.537 --> 31:48.673
overpowering with sweetness.

31:48.740 --> 31:50.975
-Yes. I mean, there's no reprieve, right?

31:51.042 --> 31:53.177
We're talking mango,
watermelon, sweet soy…

31:53.244 --> 31:55.179
-Mm-hmm.
-…king crab, naturally sweet.

31:55.246 --> 31:57.048
Flavors, regardless where
they're coming from,

31:57.115 --> 31:58.549
all still need that balance.

31:58.616 --> 32:00.018
If it's sweet from Thailand,

32:00.084 --> 32:02.520
then it needs to be
potentially acidic from the…

32:02.587 --> 32:04.389
-Mexico. Lime, whatever, yeah.
-…from Mexico.

32:04.455 --> 32:06.391
-You still need to balance that.
-Absolutely.

32:06.457 --> 32:10.128
I think the most successful,
beautiful, intriguing part of this dish

32:10.194 --> 32:13.298
is the texture that I get from this roti.
That is phenomenal.

32:13.364 --> 32:16.301
I mean, this is like elevated bar food,
which is, like, super cool.

32:17.936 --> 32:19.704
Okay, Chef, do we have a winner?

32:20.738 --> 32:21.773
We have a winner.

32:24.309 --> 32:26.644
This is it. Time to pick a winner.

32:27.545 --> 32:30.348
Home cooks, it's time
to find out who won the competition

32:30.415 --> 32:32.517
and all the cash in their bank.

32:33.451 --> 32:37.155
But first, I'd like to introduce you
to our guest chef and judge,

32:37.221 --> 32:39.290
Chef Nyesha Arrington.

32:41.159 --> 32:42.727
Whoo!

32:42.794 --> 32:44.629
-'Sup, team?
-Hi.

32:44.696 --> 32:46.297
-'Sup, Chef?
-What up?

32:47.031 --> 32:50.401
I have to say,
I really enjoyed eating all of your food.

32:50.468 --> 32:51.336
Great job.

32:52.070 --> 32:54.105
All right, let's get to the results.

32:58.209 --> 33:01.813
Who made the pita spaghetti
and fish-stick meatball?

33:02.380 --> 33:04.449
Smita, very creative dish,

33:04.515 --> 33:07.418
and the pita spaghetti
actually really worked.

33:07.485 --> 33:11.189
Although, I do have to say
the dish lacked a little bit of cohesion.

33:11.255 --> 33:12.156
Mm-hmm.

33:12.223 --> 33:15.660
-So who made the oyster po' boy?
-Guilty.

33:15.727 --> 33:18.663
I really loved
the idea of a po' boy,

33:18.730 --> 33:24.335
but the ratio of that bun to oyster
left me wanting more of those oysters.

33:25.403 --> 33:29.107
So that leaves, Minhthy,
you must have made those king crab nachos.

33:29.173 --> 33:30.341
I sure did.

33:30.408 --> 33:33.478
That crispy roti
was phenomenal, really inventive,

33:33.544 --> 33:35.179
but a lot of sweet elements going on.

33:35.246 --> 33:37.949
It really left my palate
wanting somewhere else to go.

33:39.884 --> 33:43.421
Smita,
you have $9,600 in your bank.

33:44.188 --> 33:46.424
Lucas, you have $7,000.

33:47.358 --> 33:52.063
And, Minhthy, you have
the largest total, $11,000, in your bank.

33:52.130 --> 33:54.232
Bringing people together
is what food is all about.

33:54.298 --> 33:57.668
Bringing cuisines together
is what this challenge was all about,

33:58.236 --> 33:59.670
and one of you did it best.

33:59.737 --> 34:03.141
The home cook with the best dish is…

34:07.011 --> 34:08.813
-Smita.

34:09.347 --> 34:11.215
-Ha!

34:13.084 --> 34:14.252
Thank you so much.

34:14.318 --> 34:16.020
Oh, my God.

34:16.587 --> 34:18.589
I cooked at all costs.

34:18.656 --> 34:20.792
It's actually unbelievable.

34:20.858 --> 34:22.927
It's--
It's really amazing.

34:22.994 --> 34:25.229
Not just for myself,

34:25.296 --> 34:28.332
but for India, for my country.

34:28.399 --> 34:32.303
And… very proud of what I did.

34:32.370 --> 34:34.005
Congratulations, Smita,

34:34.072 --> 34:37.708
you won the remaining balance
in your bank, $9,600,

34:37.775 --> 34:40.311
and proved you can cook at all costs.

34:40.378 --> 34:41.646
-Good job.

34:42.780 --> 34:45.049
It obviously didn't
turn out the way I was hoping,

34:45.116 --> 34:46.751
but ultimately, I had a lot of fun,

34:46.818 --> 34:48.119
and at the end of the day,

34:48.186 --> 34:50.621
I feel quite happy
with-- with what I produced.

34:51.389 --> 34:54.592
This experience means so much to me.
I pushed myself today,

34:54.659 --> 34:57.095
and I think I still pulled off
a really great dish.

34:57.762 --> 35:00.731
It's very precious
and priceless right now.

35:00.798 --> 35:03.401
It's a moment
that I don't think I will forget ever.
