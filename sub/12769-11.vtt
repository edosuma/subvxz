09:20.041 --> 09:22.750
TO SEE. (clears throat)

09:25.041 --> 09:26.917
THAT'S INTERESTING.

09:26.959 --> 09:30.250
WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

09:30.291 --> 09:32.250
COREY'S WIFE IS WRONG
TO WITHHOLD TREATMENT.

09:32.291 --> 09:34.458
THIS IS NOT A DEATH SENTENCE.

09:34.500 --> 09:37.041
HIS LIFE WILL BE DIFFERENT,
YEAH, BUT AT LEAST--
BUT THAT IS NOT FOR US
TO DETERMINE, IS IT?

09:37.083 --> 09:39.667
LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING THAT I'D
BE READY TO OFF MYSELF,

09:39.709 --> 09:42.041
BUT IF SOMETHING HAPPENED
AND I COULDN'T CUT ANYMORE,

09:42.083 --> 09:45.000
I-I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WOULD DO.
SO COREY'S NOT GONNA CHANGE
THE WORLD ON AN EPIC SCALE.

09:45.041 --> 09:47.375
HE'LL STILL BE ABLE TO WALK,
BE ABLE TO HOLD HIS GRANDKIDS.

09:47.417 --> 09:49.750
LIFE ISN'T ALL ABOUT
ACHIEVEMENTS AND WORK.
FOR YOU.

09:49.792 --> 09:52.041
YOU PAGED ME?
YEAH, I NEED YOUR HELP.

09:52.083 --> 09:53.417
I'VE ALREADY BEEN BRIEFED.

09:53.458 --> 09:56.291
THE WIFE'S WITHIN HER RIGHTS
TO DENY MEDICAL CARE.

09:56.333 --> 09:58.542
SO IF YOU GO DIGGING
IN MR. RAMSEY'S BRAIN

09:58.583 --> 10:00.542
BECAUSE YOU THINK
SHE'S MAKING THE WRONG CHOICE,

10:00.583 --> 10:02.709
YOU ARE OPENING US UP
TO A WRONGFUL LIFE SUIT.

10:02.750 --> 10:05.667
EXCUSE ME. I-I'M LOOKING
FOR COREY RAMSEY.
AND YOU ARE?

10:05.709 --> 10:11.458
I'M JANEL CHASE.
I'M HIS GIRLFRIEND.

10:19.667 --> 10:21.041
(knocks on door)

10:21.083 --> 10:22.667
GO AWAY.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.375
(whispers indistinctly)

10:28.083 --> 10:29.959
WHAT PAGE ARE YOU ON?

10:30.000 --> 10:32.166
OH, GO AWAY, VIOLET.
I BEG OF YOU, PLEASE.

10:32.208 --> 10:33.458
IS IT BAD?
IT'S BAD, ISN'T IT?

10:33.500 --> 10:35.375
IT'S UNINTERESTING,
FLOWERY, SELF-INDULGENT--

10:35.417 --> 10:37.375
(Naomi and Sheldon) GO AWAY!

10:37.417 --> 10:41.125
(whispers indistinctly)

10:41.166 --> 10:43.166
(elevator bell dings)

10:43.208 --> 10:45.583
RODRIGUEZ THINKS
I SHOULD SCOPE SUSAN.

10:45.625 --> 10:48.709
WAIT. I THOUGHT YOU BOTH AGREED
THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO.
WELL, LOOKING AT THE SCANS,

10:48.750 --> 10:50.709
HE WASN'T SURE
OF THE LIVER INVOLVEMENT.

10:50.750 --> 10:53.542
SO I'D LIKE TO GET IN THERE
AND SEE IF IT'S POSSIBLE

10:53.583 --> 10:55.583
THAT SURGERY WILL HELP--
THAT'S JUST
DESPERATION TALKING.

10:55.625 --> 10:57.583
YOU KNOW
WHAT THE ANSWER'S GONNA BE.

10:57.625 --> 11:00.041
THIS IS EXACTLY WHY DOCTORS
SHOULD NEVER OPERATE ON FAMILY.

11:00.083 --> 11:04.041
IT'S A BAD IDEA.
YOU DIDN'T OBJECT
WHEN I OPERATED ON MAYA.

11:04.083 --> 11:06.792
THAT WAS AN EMERGENCY.
THIS IS BIZZY.

11:06.834 --> 11:08.959
(sighs)
(knock on door)

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
HI.
HEY.

11:11.041 --> 11:12.375
UH...

11:12.417 --> 11:15.834
SO YOU AND I...

11:15.875 --> 11:18.041
WE'RE NOT, UM...
WE'RE NOT HAVING SEX.

11:18.083 --> 11:20.041
AND I GET THAT.

11:20.083 --> 11:23.208
I'M NOT EVEN SURE IF YOU REALLY
WANT ME TO TOUCH YOU AT ALL,

11:23.250 --> 11:25.208
WHICH IS FINE.
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

11:25.250 --> 11:28.375
I DO WISH THAT WE COULD
AT LEAST TALK ABOUT IT.

11:28.417 --> 11:30.375
OR JUST TALK AT ALL.

11:30.417 --> 11:32.041
BUT MAYBE TALKING--

11:32.083 --> 11:34.041
MAYBE WE'RE NOT THERE YET.

11:34.083 --> 11:35.625
UM...

11:35.667 --> 11:38.125
BUT WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO GET THERE,

11:38.166 --> 11:40.542
TO A TALKING PLACE.

11:40.583 --> 11:43.333
ANYWAY, YOU HAVE TO EAT,
AND SO DO I.

11:43.375 --> 11:46.041
SO I CANCELED A COUPLE
OF PATIENTS TODAY.

11:46.083 --> 11:48.041
I DROVE OUT TO GLENDALE
WHERE THEY HAVE

11:48.083 --> 11:50.041
WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE
THE GREATEST FRIED CHICKEN

11:50.083 --> 11:51.834
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

11:51.875 --> 11:54.041
AND FRIED CHICKEN
IS YOUR FAVORITE.

11:54.083 --> 11:57.041
YEAH. I DON'T KNOW.

11:57.083 --> 11:59.125
THIS SOUNDED BETTER
IN MY HEAD,

11:59.166 --> 12:02.166
BUT I THOUGHT MAYBE
WE COULD JUST SIT HERE

12:02.208 --> 12:04.250
AND NOT TALK

12:04.291 --> 12:07.166
AND... EAT FRIED CHICKEN

12:07.208 --> 12:09.709
AND WAIT FOR THE TALKING PLACE
TO COME.

12:14.083 --> 12:17.041
YOU WANT TO EAT
FRIED CHICKEN WITH ME?

12:17.083 --> 12:19.458
I WANT TO EAT
FRIED CHICKEN WITH YOU.

12:23.291 --> 12:25.250
OKAY.

12:42.750 --> 12:44.458
MM-HMM.
UH-HUH.

12:44.500 --> 12:46.750
MMM.

12:46.792 --> 12:49.041
MMM.

12:49.083 --> 12:51.667
I THINK WE SHOULD TRY IT...

12:51.709 --> 12:54.667
(mouth full) HAVING SEX.

12:54.709 --> 12:56.458
MM.

12:56.500 --> 12:58.208
TONIGHT.

12:58.250 --> 12:59.709
(chokes)

12:59.750 --> 13:01.291
YOU OKAY?

13:01.333 --> 13:03.000
(coughs)

13:09.000 --> 13:10.709
(coughs)

13:10.750 --> 13:13.083
(inhales deeply) MM.

13:13.125 --> 13:14.917
WE MET FOUR YEARS AGO.

13:14.959 --> 13:17.333
HE DIDN'T TELL ME
HE WAS MARRIED RIGHT AWAY.

13:17.375 --> 13:20.333
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT HE DID FOR A LIVING

13:20.375 --> 13:22.375
UNTIL I SAW HIM ON TV.

13:22.417 --> 13:24.375
I JUST KNEW HE WAS A BIG...

13:24.417 --> 13:27.709
(voice breaks)
A BIG SWEET KID.

13:27.750 --> 13:30.542
(normal voice) I LOVE HIM.
AND PATRICIA?

13:30.583 --> 13:33.041
SHE DOESN'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT ME.
OH.

13:33.083 --> 13:35.333
UM, I KNOW I SHOULDN'T BE HERE,
BUT... (sniffles)

13:35.375 --> 13:37.083
IS HE GONNA BE OKAY?

13:37.125 --> 13:40.166
I'M SORRY. WE CAN'T GIVE YOU
THAT INFORMATION.

13:40.208 --> 13:41.792
YOU'RE NOT COREY'S WIFE.

13:41.834 --> 13:43.834
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.
HE NEEDS SURGERY.

13:43.875 --> 13:45.542
SO W-WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR?

13:45.583 --> 13:48.000
PATRICIA WANTS TO MANAGE
THE SWELLING WITH DRUGS

13:48.041 --> 13:49.917
IN HOPES THAT COREY
WILL HEAL NATURALLY

13:49.959 --> 13:51.917
AND REGAIN
HIS FULL BRAIN FUNCTION.

13:51.959 --> 13:54.917
(sniffles) AND WILL HE?
HE SHOULD HAVE
THE OPERATION.

13:54.959 --> 13:57.417
AND THEN HE'LL BE FINE?

13:57.458 --> 14:01.083
HIS MENTAL CAPACITY
WILL BE DIMINISHED.

14:01.125 --> 14:04.917
HE'S NOT GONNA BE THE COREY
THAT YOU KNOW, A GENIUS. HE--

14:04.959 --> 14:06.917
THAT'S NOT THE COREY I KNOW.

14:06.959 --> 14:09.166
W--AND IF THE DRUGS
DON'T WORK?

14:09.208 --> 14:12.041
HE'LL DIE.

14:12.083 --> 14:14.750
I DON'T GET WHY PATRICIA
WOULD WANT THAT.

14:14.792 --> 14:16.667
SHE SAYS THAT SHE'S
RESPECTING HIS WISHES.

14:16.709 --> 14:19.667
AS HIS DOCTORS, WE CAN'T--
NO, COREY WOULD NOT
WANT TO DIE.

14:19.709 --> 14:21.041
I KNOW THAT.

14:21.083 --> 14:24.041
HIS WORK, THAT'S JUST STRESS.
HE--PLEASE.

14:24.083 --> 14:26.250
YOU CAN'T LET HER KILL HIM.

14:31.083 --> 14:32.834
IT'S GOOD.
IT'S BRILLIANT.

14:32.875 --> 14:35.041
YEAH. BRILLIANT.
BRILLIANT IS THE WORD.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.041
THE WAY YOU DISCUSS
THE ATTACK, I CRIED.

14:37.083 --> 14:39.208
IT'S COMPELLING, EMOTIONAL.
YEAH.

14:39.250 --> 14:42.208
I THINK IT'S GONNA HELP
A LOT OF PEOPLE.
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL MEMOIR.

14:42.250 --> 14:44.417
YAY.

14:44.458 --> 14:46.041
(Naomi and Sheldon laugh)

14:46.083 --> 14:48.041
(laughs) I'M GONNA--
I'M GONNA SHOW PETE.

14:48.083 --> 14:50.250
PETE IS GOING TO LOVE IT.

14:52.083 --> 14:54.041
I GOTTA DO FRIEND DUTY.

14:54.083 --> 14:55.875
ADDISON'S MOTHER?

14:55.917 --> 14:58.417
YEAH, YEAH. I DON'T KNOW
WHO'S GONNA DIE FIRST--

14:58.458 --> 15:01.500
SUSAN FROM THE CANCER OR ADDISON
FROM TRYING TO SAVE HER.

15:01.542 --> 15:03.500
HEY, VIOLET,
NICE WORK.

15:05.417 --> 15:07.000
WHEN YOU'RE ON OPRAH,

15:07.041 --> 15:09.625
AND SHE'S TELLING THE WORLD
HOW BRILLIANT YOUR BOOK IS,

15:09.667 --> 15:12.375
TRY TO FIND A WAY TO WORK
MY NAME INTO THE CONVERSATION.

15:12.417 --> 15:15.000
YOU KNOW, I'D LIKE TO HEAR
OPRAH SAY MY NAME.
(laughs)

15:15.041 --> 15:17.458
I DON'T THINK
I'VE EVER SEEN YOU SCARED.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.041
I'M NOT SCARED.

15:19.083 --> 15:21.041
A LITTLE.
I'M A LITTLE SCARED.

15:21.083 --> 15:22.875
IT'S AN IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION,
ADDIE.

15:22.917 --> 15:25.458
EVERYBODY CAN RECOGNIZE THAT.
EVERYONE EXCEPT BIZZY,
OF COURSE.

15:25.500 --> 15:28.041
WELL, SHE'S A SMART WOMAN.
SHE'S AN IRRATIONAL WOMAN.

15:28.083 --> 15:30.667
THEN DON'T DO IT. STAND UP
TO HER. YOU'RE AN ADULT.

15:30.709 --> 15:33.667
IT'S NOT LIKE YOUR RELATIONSHIP
CAN GET ANY WORSE.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

15:33.709 --> 15:36.041
SO YOU GONNA TALK TO HER?

19:42.333 --> 19:44.291
BUT IT WOULD
MAKE SUSAN MISERABLE--

19:44.333 --> 19:46.041
(Rodriguez) THE TRUTH IS,

19:46.083 --> 19:49.083
EVEN IF SHE SUFFERED THROUGH
ALL OF IT, SHE'D HAVE LESS THAN

19:49.125 --> 19:52.041
A 1 OUT OF 5 CHANCE
OF LIVING ANOTHER FEW YEARS.
SOME PEOPLE DO BETTER,

19:52.083 --> 19:54.834
BUT SOME PEOPLE
DO MUCH WORSE.

19:54.875 --> 19:57.667
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT SHE'S SAYING?
NO.

19:57.709 --> 20:00.834
NO, WHAT?
NO, I DON'T ACCEPT
YOUR NUMBERS

20:00.875 --> 20:04.166
AND I WON'T ACCEPT
YOUR CONCLUSIONS.
THEY'RE NOT MY NUMBERS,
BIZZY.

20:04.208 --> 20:06.375
I DON'T WANT 25%.
I DON'T WANT 50%.

20:06.417 --> 20:08.583
I WANT A CURE,
PLAIN AND SIMPLE.

20:08.625 --> 20:10.792
I DON'T CARE WHAT IT COSTS.

20:10.834 --> 20:14.041
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?
(Rodriguez) I'M SORRY.
WE CAN'T OFFER YOU THAT.

20:14.083 --> 20:16.875
I EXPECTED MORE FROM--
WHAT EXACTLY DID YOU EXPECT
FROM ME, BIZZY?

20:16.917 --> 20:19.250
FOR MY DAUGHTER TO BE SOMETHING
MORE THAN A PASSIVE SPECTATOR

20:19.291 --> 20:22.083
TO THE DEATH
OF SOMEONE I LOVE.

20:26.291 --> 20:27.917
Y--
DON'T.

20:34.291 --> 20:36.041
I'M GONNA TALK TO YOU.

20:36.083 --> 20:38.208
BUT DON'T YOU DARE
TRY AND HUG ME AGAIN.

20:38.250 --> 20:40.208
OKAY.

20:40.250 --> 20:42.208
(exhales)

20:42.250 --> 20:46.041
COOPER WANTS TO HAVE SEX.

20:46.083 --> 20:48.250
I WANT TO HAVE SEX.

20:48.291 --> 20:51.417
I THINK. I'M NOT SURE.

20:51.458 --> 20:54.291
MAYBE I WANT TO HAVE SEX.

20:54.333 --> 20:57.208
I-I LOVE SEX.
I'M GOOD AT SEX.

21:00.667 --> 21:02.250
AND WHAT...

21:02.291 --> 21:05.041
WHAT THAT MAN DID TO ME...

21:05.083 --> 21:07.208
WASN'T SEX.

21:07.250 --> 21:09.875
SO...

21:09.917 --> 21:12.667
THIS SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM.

21:12.709 --> 21:14.500
I AM...

21:14.542 --> 21:17.041
GOOD AT SEX.

21:17.083 --> 21:20.125
(sighs)

21:20.166 --> 21:23.125
SO HOW COME I'M CRYING
WHEN COOPER TOUCHES ME?

21:23.166 --> 21:25.458
CHARLOTTE...
YOU WERE RAPED.

21:25.500 --> 21:27.041
I KNOW THAT.

21:27.083 --> 21:31.041
BUT IT WASN'T COOPER
WHO RAPED ME.

21:31.083 --> 21:33.792
IT'S NOT FOREVER...

21:33.834 --> 21:35.291
THE WAY YOU'RE FEELING NOW.

21:35.333 --> 21:36.917
IT'S NOT.

21:36.959 --> 21:40.250
AND SOONER THAN YOU THINK,
YOU'RE GONNA FEEL STRONG AGAIN.

21:40.291 --> 21:43.542
NOT GUILTY,
NOT VULNERABLE...

21:43.583 --> 21:45.625
BUT STRONG.

21:47.542 --> 21:50.291
SEX FOR ME AND COOP,
IT'S LIKE, UH...

21:50.333 --> 21:52.917
IT'S HOW WE COMMUNICATE.

21:52.959 --> 21:56.041
I HATE USING THE PHRASE
"MAKING LOVE," BUT...

21:56.083 --> 21:58.166
IT'S WHAT IT IS.

21:58.208 --> 22:01.417
(chuckles)
IT'S HOW WE LOVE.

22:01.458 --> 22:04.375
AND I WANT THAT BACK.

22:04.417 --> 22:06.583
DO YOU?

22:08.625 --> 22:10.166
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

22:10.208 --> 22:12.166
LOOK, Y-YOU DON'T WANT
A HUG,

22:12.208 --> 22:14.834
AND I PROMISE YOU, I AM--
I'M NOT GONNA HUG YOU.

22:14.875 --> 22:18.041
BUT I-I AM GONNA TELL YOU
WHAT YOU AND I BOTH KNOW.

22:18.083 --> 22:21.041
LOVE AND INTIMACY
AND PLEASURE...

22:21.083 --> 22:24.166
NO ONE CAN TAKE THOSE THINGS
AWAY FROM YOU.

22:24.208 --> 22:25.792
NO ONE...

22:25.834 --> 22:27.166
(sighs deeply)

22:27.208 --> 22:30.041
NO MATTER
WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO YOU.

22:30.083 --> 22:33.583
NOTHING CAN COME BETWEEN
YOU AND COOPER EXCEPT YOU.

22:42.458 --> 22:45.041
BIZZY, WHAT YOU'RE DOING
TO ADDISON IS WRONG.

22:45.083 --> 22:47.959
IT'S UNFAIR,
AND I'M NOT GONNA...

22:48.000 --> 22:49.625
(sniffles)

22:49.667 --> 22:52.417
(siren wailing)

22:52.458 --> 22:54.041
(sighs)

22:54.083 --> 22:57.834
I ASK VERY LITTLE
OF MY CHILDREN.

22:57.875 --> 23:00.458
BUT WHAT I'M ASKING
OF ADDISON...

23:00.500 --> 23:03.458
IT'S NOT LOST ON ME.

23:14.083 --> 23:15.875
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE

23:15.917 --> 23:18.083
THERE'S ANYTHING LEFT
TO BE DONE.

23:18.125 --> 23:20.834
I'M SORRY.
(sniffles)

23:20.875 --> 23:22.250
I REALLY AM.

23:24.625 --> 23:26.834
BUT YOU...

23:26.875 --> 23:29.834
YOU CAN'T
KEEP PUSHING ADDISON.

23:29.875 --> 23:32.834
FOR WHATEVER IS LEFT
OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH HER,

23:32.875 --> 23:34.208
BIZZY, PLEASE...

23:34.250 --> 23:37.041
DON'T DO THIS.

23:37.083 --> 23:39.792
SUSAN MEANS...

23:39.834 --> 23:41.834
EVERYTHING TO ME,

23:41.875 --> 23:43.917
AND SHE'S...

23:48.291 --> 23:50.041
AND I HAVE TO BELIEVE

23:50.083 --> 23:52.041
THAT THERE IS
SOME WAY TO HELP HER.

23:52.083 --> 23:53.542
THAT'S WHY I CAME HERE,

23:53.583 --> 23:56.333
BECAUSE ADDISON IS THE BEST
AT WHAT SHE DOES, THE VERY BEST.

23:56.375 --> 23:59.083
WELL, HAVE YOU EVER
TOLD HER THAT?

23:59.125 --> 24:02.000
I'M HER MOTHER.
THAT'S NOT MY JOB.

24:10.500 --> 24:12.458
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

24:12.500 --> 24:15.041
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

24:15.083 --> 24:17.458
(sniffles) I-I KNOW
I SHOULDN'T BE IN HERE,

24:17.500 --> 24:21.041
BUT... (sniffles) I SAW
THAT PATRICIA HAD STEPPED OUT.

24:21.083 --> 24:23.000
STAY.

24:23.041 --> 24:26.000
(beeping continues)

24:26.041 --> 24:27.709
(sobs)

24:27.750 --> 24:30.000
HOW IS HE?

24:30.041 --> 24:33.041
HIS INTRACRANIAL PRESSURE
IS HOLDING FOR NOW.

24:33.083 --> 24:34.917
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO DIE.

24:34.959 --> 24:37.917
(sniffles) I RESPECT THAT
IT'S HER DECISION TO MAKE,

24:37.959 --> 24:41.083
BUT COREY SAYS THEY BARELY
EVEN TALK ANYMORE.

24:41.125 --> 24:43.041
(sighs) I'M SORRY.
I WISH...

24:43.083 --> 24:46.041
MY HANDS ARE TIED.
(footsteps approach)

24:46.083 --> 24:48.375
FIVE MINUTES, OKAY?
THEN YOU HAVE TO GO.

24:48.417 --> 24:50.000
WHO ARE YOU?

25:00.709 --> 25:03.792
I'M BEGGING YOU.
YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO HIM.

25:03.834 --> 25:06.625
YOU CAN'T LET HIM DIE.
WHY IS SH--WHO ARE YOU?

25:06.667 --> 25:09.834
JANEL, MAYBE IT'S BEST
THAT YOU GO.
(crying) I LOVE HIM, TOO.
LET HIM LIVE.

25:09.875 --> 25:12.834
LET HIM DECIDE
IF HE WANTS TO LIVE.
GET OUT.

25:12.875 --> 25:15.208
(monitor beeping erratically)

25:15.250 --> 25:18.500
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
HIS I.C.P.
IS GOING THROUGH THE ROOF.

25:18.542 --> 25:21.208
I'M GONNA INCREASE HIS MANNITOL.
NURSE, I NEED

25:21.250 --> 25:24.041
A VENTRICULOSTOMY KIT, ASAP.
OKAY, HOLD ON TO HIM.

25:24.083 --> 25:27.041
PATRICIA, IF I DON'T INSERT
A TUBE INTO HIS HEAD

25:27.083 --> 25:29.041
TO RELIEVE THE PRESSURE,
HE'S GONNA DIE...
(snaps gloves)

25:29.083 --> 25:31.041
RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW.

25:31.083 --> 25:34.041
I NEED YOU TO TELL ME
THIS IS OKAY.

25:34.083 --> 25:36.250
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON
IN HERE?

25:36.291 --> 25:39.041
DID YOU AUTHORIZE THIS?
AUTHORIZE? HE'S DYING.

25:39.083 --> 25:41.417
PATRICIA--
YOU CAN'T JUST DO THIS
WITHOUT HER PERMISSION.

25:41.458 --> 25:44.959
SHE CAN SUE IF SHE WANTS.
I'M SAVING HIS LIFE.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.208
(beeping continues)

25:47.250 --> 25:49.041
(sighs) YOU OKAY?

25:49.083 --> 25:52.125
FOR A PASSIVE SPECTATOR.
OH, ADDISON--

25:52.166 --> 25:53.750
I CAN'T WIN HERE.

25:53.792 --> 25:56.125
IF I DON'T DO SOMETHING,
BIZZY WILL HATE ME.

25:56.166 --> 25:59.041
AND IF I DO AND GET ANYTHING
LESS THAN SOME MIRACLE RESULT,

25:59.083 --> 26:01.041
THEN SHE'S STILL
GONNA HATE ME.

26:01.083 --> 26:04.041
I DON'T THINK SO. I THINK
SHE JUST WANTS YOU TO TRY.

26:04.083 --> 26:07.041
SHE BELIEVES IN YOU.
YEAH, WELL, SHE HAS
A FUNNY WAY OF SHOWING IT.

26:07.083 --> 26:09.041
NO, NO, SHE--SHE CAME HERE
BECAUSE SHE KNEW

26:09.083 --> 26:12.083
THE ONLY THING THAT COULD HELP
SUSAN WOULD BE A MIRACLE.

26:12.125 --> 26:14.083
AND SHE BELIEVES
THAT IF ANYONE'S

26:14.125 --> 26:17.709
GONNA GIVE HER A MIRACLE,
YOU CAN.
WHY ARE YOU SUDDENLY
ON HER SIDE?

26:17.750 --> 26:19.709
BECAUSE SHE WAS CRYING.

26:19.750 --> 26:20.917
WHAT?

26:20.959 --> 26:22.041
YEAH.

26:22.083 --> 26:23.083
B--

26:23.125 --> 26:25.041
BIZZY DOES NOT CRY.

26:25.083 --> 26:26.041
(laughs)

26:26.083 --> 26:29.041
IS THERE A PART OF YOU
THAT DOESN'T WANT TO TRY

26:29.083 --> 26:32.041
BECAUSE...
YOU HATE YOUR MOTHER

26:32.083 --> 26:34.250
FOR NOT BEING A MOTHER?
WHAT? WHAT--NO, THAT'S NOT--

26:34.291 --> 26:36.333
WHY WOULD YOU EVEN
SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

26:36.375 --> 26:39.041
BECAUSE YOU ARE
ADDISON FORBES MONTGOMERY...

26:39.083 --> 26:42.041
WORLD-CLASS SURGEON.
(chuckles)
(laughs)

26:42.083 --> 26:44.041
AND I HAVE NEVER, EVER

26:44.083 --> 26:46.166
SEEN YOU BACK AWAY
FROM A FIGHT.

26:50.875 --> 26:52.500
(indistinct conversations)

26:52.542 --> 26:54.625
OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM
IS THAT THE CANCER

26:54.667 --> 26:56.625
HAS METASTASIZED
TO AREAS OF YOUR BODY

26:56.667 --> 26:58.625
THAT ARE EITHER TOO DANGEROUS
FOR ME TO CUT

26:58.667 --> 27:00.709
OR TOO DIFFICULT
FOR ME TO REACH.

27:00.750 --> 27:03.291
BUT, UM...
I DID SOME RESEARCH,

27:03.333 --> 27:06.041
AND I FOUND A NEW PROTOCOL.
I...

27:06.083 --> 27:08.667
I WAS TRAINED ON THIS MACHINE.
IT'S CALLED THE da VINCI.

27:08.709 --> 27:11.250
YOU'RE GONNA LET A MACHINE
OPERATE ON ME?

27:11.291 --> 27:13.250
NO, NO, NO. I WOULD
OPERATE ON YOU,

27:13.291 --> 27:15.458
BUT I WOULD BE DOING IT
USING THE MACHINE.

27:15.500 --> 27:17.458
IT ENABLES ME TO CUT IN WAYS

27:17.500 --> 27:19.542
THAT I WOULD NEVER
BE ABLE TO DO FREEHAND.

27:19.583 --> 27:21.583
HAVE YOU EVER DONE THIS
BEFORE?

27:21.625 --> 27:24.667
IT'S GENERALLY NOT USED
ON CASES LIKE YOURS YET,

27:24.709 --> 27:26.667
BUT I KNOW ITS CAPABILITIES,

27:26.709 --> 27:29.583
AND I THINK IT'S
THE BEST WAY TO HELP YOU.

27:29.625 --> 27:31.291
HMM.

27:31.333 --> 27:33.709
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

27:33.750 --> 27:35.709
IF IT WEREN'T
FOR YOUR MOTHER,

27:35.750 --> 27:40.000
I DON'T THINK I EVER
WOULD'VE COME HERE.

27:40.041 --> 27:41.542
BUT I LOVE HER.

27:41.583 --> 27:44.667
SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

27:46.458 --> 27:49.041
I WANT TO DO IT...

27:49.083 --> 27:51.041
FOR HER.

27:51.083 --> 27:53.000
(beeping continues)

27:53.041 --> 27:57.417
HEY, BIZZY.

27:57.458 --> 28:00.417
SO YOU HAVE A PLAN NOW.

28:00.458 --> 28:02.041
(beeping continues)

28:02.083 --> 28:04.750
SO IS THERE GONNA BE--THERE'S
GONNA BE, LIKE, A BOOK TOUR?

28:04.792 --> 28:07.291
LIKE 12 CITIES, 10 DAYS,
READINGS, AUTOGRAPHS?

28:07.333 --> 28:09.959
OH, IF THEY DO, CAN I--
CAN I BE A ROADIE?

28:10.041 --> 28:12.250
(laughs, mouth full)
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?
NANNY.

28:12.291 --> 28:14.417
OH.
YOU WANT TO GO
ON THE ROAD WITH MOMMY?

28:14.458 --> 28:16.625
HUH?
OH.

28:16.667 --> 28:19.041
AREN'T YOU SO PROUD
OF HER?

28:19.083 --> 28:22.333
(blows kiss)
OH, MY GOD. ONE DAY,
HE'S GONNA KNOW HOW TO READ.

28:22.375 --> 28:25.458
OH, NO, NO. DON'T GO THERE.
NO, HE'S GONNA KNOW
ALL THE MOST INTIMATE DETAILS

28:25.500 --> 28:27.333
OF HIS MOTHER'S LIFE.
MM.

28:27.375 --> 28:29.041
AND MY PARENTS AND YOU...

28:29.083 --> 28:31.417
(Lucas babbles)
IT'S A BOOK, VIOLET.
IT'S NOT A SEX TAPE.

28:31.458 --> 28:34.250
BUT STILL--
NO BUTS.
YOU COULDA TAKEN THOSE PAGES

28:34.291 --> 28:36.417
AND STUFFED 'EM IN A DRAWER
SOMEWHERE, BUT YOU DIDN'T.

28:36.458 --> 28:39.458
YOU SENT 'EM OFF TO SEE
IF ANYBODY WOULD CARE,

28:39.500 --> 28:41.625
AND THEY WILL.
PEOPLE WILL CARE.

28:41.667 --> 28:43.959
THEY WILL BE HELPED
BY WHAT YOU WROTE.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.500
ARE YOU SURE?
NO, NOT AT ALL.
YOU HAVEN'T LET ME READ IT.

28:46.542 --> 28:49.041
(laughs)
NO, I MEAN, YOU KNOW...

28:49.083 --> 28:50.417
I'M KIDDING.

28:50.458 --> 28:53.417
I'M SURE IT'S HONEST
AND REAL AND IT'S YOU.

28:53.458 --> 28:55.625
YOU DID A GOOD THING.

28:57.542 --> 28:59.917
OH, YOU COULD KISS ME
RIGHT NOW, COULDN'T YOU?

28:59.959 --> 29:03.625
DO YOU NEED A KISS?
OH, I NEED MORE THAN A KISS.

29:03.667 --> 29:05.041
I KNOW.

29:05.083 --> 29:08.000
I'M SORRY
IT'S SO DIFFICULT, COOP.

29:10.917 --> 29:13.041
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

29:13.083 --> 29:14.625
I NEED YOU.

29:14.667 --> 29:16.041
YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE.

29:16.083 --> 29:18.667
I'M GOING TO USE
THE da VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEM

29:18.709 --> 29:20.458
ON SUSAN TOMORROW.

29:20.500 --> 29:23.458
I APPLAUD YOUR AMBITION,
BUT YOUR JUDGMENT IS--

29:23.500 --> 29:26.083
IT'S POSSIBLE.
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.
THE QUESTION IS,

29:26.125 --> 29:29.083
ARE YOU GONNA BE SELLING SUSAN
AND YOUR MOTHER FALSE HOPE?

29:29.125 --> 29:31.709
WELL, IF I WERE DOING IT
ON MY OWN, PROBABLY,

29:31.750 --> 29:34.041
BUT THAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN.

29:34.083 --> 29:36.041
I NEED YOU TO INFUSE
HEATED CHEMO

29:36.083 --> 29:38.750
DIRECTLY INTO HER ABDOMEN
AFTER I CUT.

29:38.792 --> 29:40.458
IT'LL DESTROY ANY DISEASE
LEFT BEHIND.

29:40.500 --> 29:43.709
DON'T PLAY HARD TO GET.
YOU ARE.

29:43.750 --> 29:46.625
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW?

29:46.667 --> 29:48.667
(woman speaks indistinctly
over p.a.)

29:57.083 --> 29:59.083
(sighs)

30:02.125 --> 30:03.542
AHH.

30:03.583 --> 30:05.041
(Charlotte) GOOD NIGHT.

30:05.083 --> 30:06.917
GOOD NIGHT.

30:08.333 --> 30:10.959
MM.

30:12.417 --> 30:14.917
MM.

30:23.083 --> 30:25.834
MM.

30:45.083 --> 30:46.750
