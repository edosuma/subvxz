WEBVTT

00:01.653 --> 00:03.655
[laughter, indistinct chatter]

00:07.050 --> 00:08.834
LENNY:
So me and Frank were on patrol

00:08.878 --> 00:10.271
up in Harlem, the 2-5,

00:10.314 --> 00:12.403
Oh, yeah.and we see this
building on fire...

00:12.447 --> 00:13.491
I remember...
I remember that.

00:13.535 --> 00:15.058
I don't.
No.

00:15.102 --> 00:16.277
That's before
you transferred in.

00:16.320 --> 00:18.235
Anyway, this woman
comes running up to us

00:18.279 --> 00:20.324
and she says "My baby's in
there! My baby's in there!"

00:20.368 --> 00:21.499
So Frank and I,
we decide

00:21.543 --> 00:23.371
not to wait for
the fire department.

00:23.414 --> 00:24.546
We head right inside.

00:24.589 --> 00:26.678
We get inside,
it's smoky as hell,

00:26.722 --> 00:27.810
we're coughing and choking.

00:27.853 --> 00:29.246
I manage to get this woman

00:29.290 --> 00:30.769
and her mother

00:30.813 --> 00:32.858
and the frickin' dog
out into the street.

00:32.902 --> 00:34.469
I run back inside.

00:34.512 --> 00:35.687
What do I see?

00:35.731 --> 00:37.341
I see Frank coming
down the stairs,

00:37.385 --> 00:39.735
through the flames,
carrying a baby.

00:39.778 --> 00:41.650
Now, he's almost out
the door of the building

00:41.693 --> 00:43.130
when we hear
somebody else screaming.

00:43.173 --> 00:44.827
Well, yeah.
So I hand Lenny the kid

00:44.870 --> 00:46.046
and I head back upstairs.

00:46.089 --> 00:47.656
I head out the door,

00:47.699 --> 00:50.137
and all of a sudden, there's all
these photographers outside,

00:50.180 --> 00:52.182
snapping photographs
of this white cop

00:52.226 --> 00:53.531
cradling a black baby.

00:53.575 --> 00:54.532
The crowd is cheering,

00:54.576 --> 00:56.230
Lenny's taking bows...

00:56.273 --> 00:58.145
Two minutes later,
Frank comes stumbling out,

00:58.188 --> 00:59.407
covered in soot,

00:59.450 --> 01:00.843
helping this old man
in his underwear.

01:00.886 --> 01:02.497
Now, nobody wants
to see a picture

01:02.540 --> 01:05.369
of an old man in his underwear
with a cop holding him.

01:05.413 --> 01:06.762
Well, maybe now
they do, but...

01:06.805 --> 01:07.937
Wait. It gets better.

01:07.980 --> 01:09.547
So the next day,

01:09.591 --> 01:13.334
my picture is on the front page
of every paper in the city.

01:13.377 --> 01:15.075
They even used it
for the recruiting poster.

01:15.118 --> 01:16.772
Did I get a lot of women
from that?

01:16.815 --> 01:18.904
Oh, yes, I did!

01:18.948 --> 01:19.905
[laughter]

01:19.949 --> 01:21.124
Thank you, Frank.

01:21.168 --> 01:23.822
What'd you name your
sports bar in Florida?

01:23.866 --> 01:25.215
Well, I-I decided
to keep it humble.

01:25.259 --> 01:26.608
I called it The Hero's Den.

01:26.651 --> 01:28.740
And what did you use
as the logo?

01:28.784 --> 01:30.394
Well, the picture
of me and the baby. Iconic.

01:30.438 --> 01:32.179
You know,
somebody really should

01:32.222 --> 01:33.441
write all this down.

01:33.484 --> 01:34.442
Write what down?

01:34.485 --> 01:35.878
These stories.

01:35.921 --> 01:37.358
Well, maybe
somebody already did.

01:38.402 --> 01:40.230
Nobody did.

01:40.274 --> 01:41.492
No, somebody did.

01:41.536 --> 01:43.233
I put it all down.

01:43.277 --> 01:45.279
Like in a diary?
No.

01:45.322 --> 01:47.237
Like in a book.

01:47.281 --> 01:49.718
I wrote a book. About us.

01:49.761 --> 01:51.415
All the true stories.

01:51.459 --> 01:53.722
It's called Back in the Day.
It's coming out in the fall.

01:53.765 --> 01:54.984
You guys are gonna love it.

01:55.027 --> 01:56.551
Am I in it?Of course you're in it.

01:56.594 --> 01:59.119
You're not gonna like what
you see, but you're in it.

01:59.162 --> 02:01.121
[laughter]

02:08.824 --> 02:09.868
I'm home!

02:09.912 --> 02:11.870
LINDA:
Hey. How was your day?

02:11.914 --> 02:13.176
Same as usual.

02:13.220 --> 02:16.223
Ridding the city
of the forces of evil.

02:17.572 --> 02:19.530
What's going on with you guys?

02:19.574 --> 02:21.402
I'm just helping Jack
with his homework.

02:21.445 --> 02:23.491
I got you sesame chicken
from that new Chinese place.

02:23.534 --> 02:25.928
Great. You always
order the best.

02:25.971 --> 02:27.625
Aw, thanks, babe.

02:27.669 --> 02:29.279
Where's Sean?

02:29.323 --> 02:30.541
Went up to read.

02:30.585 --> 02:32.413
Play video games, more like it.

02:32.456 --> 02:35.807
I think I'm gonna
go upstairs, too.

02:35.851 --> 02:37.200
What happened
to your eye?

02:37.244 --> 02:38.201
What?

02:38.245 --> 02:39.681
Your eye.

02:39.724 --> 02:40.812
You got a shiner.

02:40.856 --> 02:42.379
Yeah, I got elbowed
playing basketball.

02:42.423 --> 02:44.381
It's no big deal.

02:44.425 --> 02:47.079
Well, I'm gonna put up
your dinner for you.

02:52.607 --> 02:53.695
[sighs]

02:54.739 --> 02:56.480
Okay.

02:56.524 --> 02:58.526
[picks up keys]

03:07.839 --> 03:09.406
[camera clicking]

03:12.279 --> 03:13.236
Hey.

03:13.280 --> 03:15.107
You know what's going on?

03:15.151 --> 03:17.327
I fell asleep on
my Barcalounger.

03:17.371 --> 03:18.546
What a way to wake up.

03:18.589 --> 03:19.547
CONNOLLY:
ADA Reagan.

03:19.590 --> 03:21.418
Investigator Abetemarco.

03:21.462 --> 03:22.463
Thanks for getting here.

03:22.506 --> 03:23.638
Sure. Why the call?

03:23.681 --> 03:25.248
We got a double.

03:25.292 --> 03:26.684
Looks like
a robbery gone bad.

03:26.728 --> 03:29.600
Man was high as a kite,
demanding money,

03:29.644 --> 03:31.646
then he just started
shooting up the place.

03:31.689 --> 03:33.213
What's it to us?

03:33.256 --> 03:35.519
Well, one of the victims

03:35.563 --> 03:38.479
was an investigator in
your office-- Robert McQueen.

03:38.522 --> 03:39.306
McQueen?

03:39.349 --> 03:40.481
Oh, man.

03:40.524 --> 03:41.917
TECH:
Detective?

03:41.960 --> 03:43.266
We found something that
tested positive for blood.

03:43.310 --> 03:44.659
It blended in with
the wood grain,

03:44.702 --> 03:46.617
so we didn't
see it initially,

03:46.661 --> 03:48.489
but it leads all the way
from the bar area

03:48.532 --> 03:50.055
out into the street.

03:50.099 --> 03:51.622
Could be where
he got into his car.

03:51.666 --> 03:54.277
Let's hope we have cameras
out there.

03:54.321 --> 03:55.670
You think it's
the shooter's blood?

03:55.713 --> 03:57.280
Witnesses say
McQueen got off

03:57.324 --> 03:59.674
one round at the suspect
before he was killed.

03:59.717 --> 04:01.153
Maybe it found
its mark.

04:01.197 --> 04:02.981
Yeah, well, you should check
every hospital in the area.

04:03.025 --> 04:04.635
Already on it.

04:04.679 --> 04:06.028
So how can we help?

04:06.071 --> 04:07.769
You know why your man
was in the bar last night?

04:07.812 --> 04:09.553
Is this his usual hangout?

04:09.597 --> 04:11.425
Nah, he wasn't
much of a drinker.

04:11.468 --> 04:13.557
Could have been
working a case, then?

04:13.601 --> 04:14.558
The other vic

04:14.602 --> 04:16.125
was a young woman, Jenny Egan.

04:16.168 --> 04:17.822
She was with McQueen at the bar.

04:17.866 --> 04:20.608
You think he was
having an affair?

04:20.651 --> 04:22.566
I guess anything's
possible, but...

04:22.610 --> 04:24.307
he's in Park Slope

04:24.351 --> 04:25.308
with his wife and kids.

04:25.352 --> 04:26.657
Seems pretty happy to me.

04:26.701 --> 04:28.398
Yeah, I was out at the house
last week.

04:28.442 --> 04:30.835
He worships the ground
his wife walks on.

04:30.879 --> 04:32.402
At least he did.

04:35.275 --> 04:38.408
You want to make
the notification?

04:38.452 --> 04:39.801
Well, it's actually
his case.

04:39.844 --> 04:41.281
I know, but
you knew him.

04:41.324 --> 04:43.500
And so did you.

04:43.544 --> 04:44.893
Flip a coin?

04:44.936 --> 04:45.894
No.

04:45.937 --> 04:47.939
We'll both go.

04:51.203 --> 04:53.771
Ah, this is brutal.

04:55.817 --> 04:58.863
â™ª

05:20.581 --> 05:22.452
Pop?

05:22.496 --> 05:26.587
How much did you cooperate
on The Boys in Blue?

05:26.630 --> 05:28.632
Cooperate?

05:28.676 --> 05:30.330
I threatened to sue.

05:30.373 --> 05:33.202
They got every detail
of our investigation wrong.

05:33.245 --> 05:34.551
The dialogue
was ridiculous,

05:34.595 --> 05:37.685
the characters cartoonish.

05:37.728 --> 05:39.121
But what happened?

05:39.164 --> 05:41.558
You threatened to sue;
the book still came out.

05:41.602 --> 05:43.560
Well, we made them
fictionalize everything.

05:43.604 --> 05:45.170
And then it turned into

05:45.214 --> 05:47.390
that horrible TV movie
with Robert Conrad.

05:47.434 --> 05:49.653
I kind of liked it.

05:49.697 --> 05:51.786
Come on.

05:51.829 --> 05:53.309
With these baby blues,

05:53.353 --> 05:54.919
only one actor
could've played me:

05:54.963 --> 05:55.920
Paul Newman.

05:55.964 --> 05:57.922
Right. Dead ringers.

05:59.620 --> 06:01.883
That what kept
you up all night?

06:01.926 --> 06:03.537
My old partner,
Lenny Ross,

06:03.580 --> 06:07.497
got it in his head to write a
tell-all about the bad old days.

06:07.541 --> 06:09.499
Lenny Ross. How is he?

06:09.543 --> 06:11.109
Candid.

06:11.153 --> 06:12.720
That bad?

06:12.763 --> 06:15.897
Well... how many times
you tell a story

06:15.940 --> 06:17.464
and you leave
a couple things out

06:17.507 --> 06:19.944
'cause no one would believe it
anyway if you left them in?

06:19.988 --> 06:21.555
Thousands.

06:21.598 --> 06:23.208
Yeah, well, Lenny?

06:23.252 --> 06:24.949
He leaves everything in.

06:24.993 --> 06:26.473
Everything.

06:26.516 --> 06:28.126
Yikes.

06:28.170 --> 06:30.520
That's a polite way
of putting it.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.877
Robert must've been
meeting someone that night.

06:41.966 --> 06:43.968
I'm gonna tell you this
from experience, Erin:

06:44.012 --> 06:46.710
Nothing good happens
in a bar after 3:00 a.m.

06:46.754 --> 06:48.451
That's how I met my first wife,

06:48.495 --> 06:50.192
and I'm still paying
for that one.

06:50.235 --> 06:52.499
ERIN:
You checking your Facebook?

06:52.542 --> 06:53.761
I'm looking at the accounts

06:53.804 --> 06:55.589
of the other people
in the bar that night;

06:55.632 --> 06:57.199
seeing if any of them
were friends with McQueen.

06:57.242 --> 06:59.680
Any luck so far?Nothing.

06:59.723 --> 07:01.856
What about the other victim,
Jenny Egan?

07:01.899 --> 07:03.118
Maybe she's got some photos

07:03.161 --> 07:04.293
of Robert on her page.

07:07.427 --> 07:08.645
I don't think Robert's
in that photo.

07:08.689 --> 07:10.647
He could be deep background,
by the water.

07:10.691 --> 07:12.301
A little respect, Detective.

07:12.344 --> 07:13.520
Hey,

07:13.563 --> 07:15.609
if we're not laughing,
we're crying.

07:15.652 --> 07:16.827
Keep scrolling.

07:16.871 --> 07:18.655
Okay, Jenny's timeline.

07:18.699 --> 07:21.528
Executive secretary
at an accounting firm,

07:21.571 --> 07:23.791
University of
Michigan alum.

07:23.834 --> 07:25.880
Oh, man.

07:25.923 --> 07:28.535
Just got married six months ago.

07:28.578 --> 07:29.710
That sucks.

07:29.753 --> 07:32.147
Mitchell her maiden name?

07:32.190 --> 07:34.584
So what?

07:34.628 --> 07:35.716
Well, I've been
going through

07:35.759 --> 07:37.544
Robert's other cases,

07:37.587 --> 07:42.200
trying to find some link,
and that is ringing a bell.

07:45.987 --> 07:47.597
Okay.

07:47.641 --> 07:50.774
People v. Hoff Construction.

07:50.818 --> 07:52.210
It was a bid-rigging case

07:52.254 --> 07:54.517
that our office was trying
to bring last year.

07:55.997 --> 07:58.782
And Jenny Mitchell
is on the witness list.

07:58.826 --> 08:00.262
Robert was the investigator.

08:00.305 --> 08:02.569
That was about
the Hurricane Sandy rebuild,

08:02.612 --> 08:03.918
who was getting the contracts.

08:03.961 --> 08:06.573
Yeah, it didn't even make it
to the grand jury.

08:06.616 --> 08:09.619
One witness... had an accident.

08:09.663 --> 08:12.056
The defendant disappeared,
presumed dead.

08:12.100 --> 08:13.797
I remember that.

08:13.841 --> 08:15.190
Robert thought
it was a mob thing.

08:15.233 --> 08:16.974
Maybe Jenny had new evidence,

08:17.018 --> 08:18.933
someone stopped her
from giving it.

08:18.976 --> 08:20.195
Workable theory.

08:20.238 --> 08:22.284
David Harris was
the ADA on that.

08:22.327 --> 08:24.286
He'll know.

08:26.680 --> 08:29.030
Reagan. Janko.

08:30.553 --> 08:31.685
Get out of the bag

08:31.728 --> 08:32.860
and change back
into your street clothes.

08:32.903 --> 08:34.470
What's up,
Detective?

08:34.514 --> 08:35.732
My boss cleared it
with your C.O.

08:35.776 --> 08:37.386
You two are gonna help us out
on a case today.

08:37.429 --> 08:39.562
Uh, doing what?

08:39.606 --> 08:41.564
We're looking for a guy
named Roger Jeffers.

08:41.608 --> 08:43.697
He's wanted in a series
of home invasions.

08:43.740 --> 08:45.046
It's his mother's birthday
tomorrow, and...

08:45.089 --> 08:46.526
You want us to sit on her house?

08:46.569 --> 08:47.527
You get a gold star.

08:47.570 --> 08:48.702
Here's a copy of the case file

08:48.745 --> 08:50.660
and some photos
of Jeffers.

08:50.704 --> 08:52.967
You'll relieve my guys
at the end of their tour.

08:53.010 --> 08:54.403
All right?

08:54.446 --> 08:56.840
You wanted a shot, Janko;
now you got it.

08:58.276 --> 08:59.582
What's he talking about?

08:59.626 --> 09:00.714
When'd you get so
buddy-buddy with him?

09:00.757 --> 09:02.019
Oh, he was an instructor

09:02.063 --> 09:03.499
on that undercover course
I took.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.675
I been lobbying him to give us
an assignment ever since.

09:05.719 --> 09:06.720
"Us"?

09:08.156 --> 09:10.593
I know you don't like
to put your name out there,

09:10.637 --> 09:12.377
so I did
a little pushing.

09:12.421 --> 09:14.989
What's the matter?
You don't want in?

09:15.032 --> 09:16.860
No, it's fine.

09:16.904 --> 09:19.471
Just check before you
include me in something, okay?

09:21.691 --> 09:24.215
That book gets published
over my dead body.

09:24.259 --> 09:25.695
You haven't even read it,
Garrett.

09:25.739 --> 09:26.740
I read the coverage.

09:26.783 --> 09:28.611
Simon & Schuster
was kind enough

09:28.655 --> 09:30.700
to e-mail me the coverage
and the sample chapter,

09:30.744 --> 09:32.006
and that's all
I need to read.

09:32.049 --> 09:33.921
Book's good.[chuckles]

09:33.964 --> 09:35.749
GARRETT:
The book's good?

09:35.792 --> 09:37.185
For Lenny Ross maybe, not you.

09:37.228 --> 09:38.665
And how is this
my call, Garrett?

09:38.708 --> 09:39.666
You have rights,
Frank.

09:39.709 --> 09:41.102
You never gave consent,

09:41.145 --> 09:44.279
you never sat down for
an on-the-record interview.

09:44.322 --> 09:46.281
They're portraying you as
the lead actor in stories

09:46.324 --> 09:49.066
that are all but impossible
to fact-check.

09:49.110 --> 09:50.720
He's my friend.

09:50.764 --> 09:52.896
He was my partner.

09:52.940 --> 09:55.682
I do not want to go
all legal on him.

09:55.725 --> 09:57.292
And I hope you don't have to.

09:57.335 --> 09:58.685
Hopefully,
he'll listen to reason.

09:58.728 --> 09:59.773
You don't know Lenny.

09:59.816 --> 10:01.775
No. I don't.

10:01.818 --> 10:03.167
But what I do know

10:03.211 --> 10:04.995
is if that book
gets published,

10:05.039 --> 10:07.607
you're handing your enemies
a bat to beat you with.

10:07.650 --> 10:09.260
With nails sticking out
of the business end.

10:09.304 --> 10:11.175
Oh, cut it out.Are you kidding me?

10:11.219 --> 10:12.786
Poole? Potter?

10:12.829 --> 10:13.787
You just hold on!

10:13.830 --> 10:15.005
Every activist judge,

10:15.049 --> 10:16.528
community megaphone,

10:16.572 --> 10:18.095
left-leaning newspaper editor
in the city

10:18.139 --> 10:19.923
is gonna go, "Hallelujah!"

10:19.967 --> 10:21.838
Oh, will you just
hold it for a second?

10:21.882 --> 10:22.839
What?

10:22.883 --> 10:24.841
Aren't you winding me up here?

10:24.885 --> 10:26.321
I mean, just a little?

10:26.364 --> 10:27.583
Why would I do that?

10:27.627 --> 10:29.977
More trouble for me
means more work for you.

10:32.022 --> 10:34.024
Frank, look at me.

10:35.504 --> 10:37.549
The truth is,
if you let this go forward,

10:37.593 --> 10:39.943
I won't have
a lick of work to do, okay?

10:39.987 --> 10:41.771
All I'll be able to do is duck.

10:41.815 --> 10:43.077
And you, too.

10:43.120 --> 10:44.252
We were cops.

10:44.295 --> 10:46.080
Young, single.

10:46.123 --> 10:48.212
Throwing ourselves in our work

10:48.256 --> 10:51.041
at a time when this city might
as well have been the Wild West.

10:51.085 --> 10:52.956
That has a nice ring to it.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.045
The book has a different ring.

10:55.089 --> 10:57.700
Straight up.

10:57.744 --> 11:00.355
Broadway Frank Reagan
and his merry band

11:00.398 --> 11:04.315
of head-knocking, hard-drinking,
stewardess-banging mad dogs.

11:04.359 --> 11:06.927
There'd be no high moral
ground left to you.

11:06.970 --> 11:10.713
There'd be no coming back.

11:10.757 --> 11:12.933
I know that.

11:12.976 --> 11:15.065
I know you know.

11:17.067 --> 11:18.503
What do I do?

11:18.547 --> 11:20.201
The lawyers are waiting
for our go-ahead.

11:20.244 --> 11:22.856
They want to push
for an injunction.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.689
[gunfire over TV]

11:45.966 --> 11:47.184
Dad, Mom said I could play

11:47.228 --> 11:48.664
another game before I start
all my homework.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.535
First you're gonna tell me
what happened to your eye.

11:50.579 --> 11:51.928
Then you can play your game.

11:51.972 --> 11:53.756
I already told you.
Can you turn it on?

11:53.800 --> 11:55.192
The truth this time.

11:55.236 --> 11:58.065
Come on, I know when
you're lying to me, Jack.

11:58.108 --> 12:01.851
It's the downside to having
an old man who's a detective.

12:01.895 --> 12:04.114
Come on, tell me who hit you.

12:04.158 --> 12:05.463
Dad, can you stop?

12:05.507 --> 12:07.727
Listen, I had plenty
of fights in my day.

12:07.770 --> 12:10.033
And I lost my share.

12:10.077 --> 12:12.166
Okay, I'm just trying
to help you here.

12:12.209 --> 12:14.821
Now, tell me.

12:14.864 --> 12:17.127
This kid's been cheating
off me all semester,

12:17.171 --> 12:18.912
taking whatever he
wants out of my lunch.

12:18.955 --> 12:20.696
Calls it the
"nerd tax."

12:20.740 --> 12:21.871
But you're not a nerd.

12:21.915 --> 12:24.178
I wear glasses.

12:24.221 --> 12:25.919
Actually read books.

12:25.962 --> 12:28.225
That's all it takes
with this goon.

12:28.269 --> 12:30.532
Okay, why'd he clock you?

12:30.575 --> 12:33.187
Fed him the wrong answers
on a test to mess him up.

12:33.230 --> 12:34.884
Okay.

12:34.928 --> 12:36.233
And?

12:36.277 --> 12:38.366
Then he found out
and punched me

12:38.409 --> 12:40.194
in the schoolyard
in front of everyone.

12:40.237 --> 12:43.763
What advice
did your mom give you?

12:43.806 --> 12:46.243
She wants to call the principal
and get the parents involved

12:46.287 --> 12:49.725
and do peer-to-peer mediation,
but I don't want to snitch.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.814
[sighs]
Okay.

12:51.858 --> 12:53.860
Is this kid big?

12:53.903 --> 12:55.644
Like, six-foot tall
or bigger?

12:55.687 --> 12:57.385
Yeah, he's
football-player big.

12:57.428 --> 12:58.908
He's a psycho.

12:58.952 --> 13:01.563
All right, then you don't
want to fight him.

13:01.606 --> 13:04.958
We got to come up with another
way to get him to back off.

13:05.001 --> 13:07.482
It's all I think
about, Dad. How?

13:07.525 --> 13:09.658
There's a thing

13:09.701 --> 13:12.487
that me and my friends did
back in junior high

13:12.530 --> 13:14.968
to someone who bullied us.

13:15.011 --> 13:16.273
What was it?

13:16.317 --> 13:19.755
If I tell you now,
you got to promise me

13:19.799 --> 13:21.104
that you won't tell your mom.

13:21.148 --> 13:22.279
L-Look, I promise.

13:22.323 --> 13:24.978
Just tell me, please.

13:25.021 --> 13:27.023
[sighs]

13:29.939 --> 13:33.595
If a grinder like Dave Harris
is missing a day of work,

13:33.638 --> 13:35.858
he must really be
crushed about McQueen.

13:35.902 --> 13:37.425
Well, I just
hope he knows

13:37.468 --> 13:39.688
why Robert was in
that bar that night.

13:40.732 --> 13:41.690
Senator Harris.

13:41.733 --> 13:42.778
Sorry to disturb you.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.040
We're here to see David.

13:44.084 --> 13:46.347
Oh, of course, of course.
Come in.

13:46.390 --> 13:48.915
This is Inspector Abetemarco
from the D.A.'s office.

13:48.958 --> 13:50.917
How are you, sir?Pleasure.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.527
I'm Erin Reagan.

13:52.570 --> 13:53.833
Erin Reagan, of course!

13:53.876 --> 13:55.878
Of course, I know you.

13:55.922 --> 13:57.488
I'm a great supporter
of your father's.

13:57.532 --> 13:59.360
How is David?

13:59.403 --> 14:01.144
Well, he's very shaky.

14:01.188 --> 14:03.190
He and Robert
were extremely close.

14:03.233 --> 14:04.800
I've been afraid to leave him.

14:04.844 --> 14:05.932
It's a terrible tragedy.

14:05.975 --> 14:07.324
Mm. It just seems like

14:07.368 --> 14:09.152
he was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

14:09.196 --> 14:10.197
Maybe.

14:10.240 --> 14:12.634
Are there any updates?Nothing yet.

14:12.677 --> 14:14.592
It's ongoing.

14:14.636 --> 14:16.594
Oh. Oh, here he is now.

14:16.638 --> 14:18.553
David, your colleagues
are here.

14:18.596 --> 14:20.772
ABETEMARCO: How you doing, pal?Hey.

14:20.816 --> 14:22.905
STANFORD:
Is it all right

14:22.949 --> 14:24.254
if I take off now?

14:24.298 --> 14:26.169
Yeah, of course, Dad. Go.

14:26.213 --> 14:28.084
I'm going to stop by

14:28.128 --> 14:29.781
and see Robert's widow.

14:29.825 --> 14:31.914
I think we're gonna
take care of the funeral.

14:31.958 --> 14:33.176
That's very nice of you.

14:33.220 --> 14:35.657
STANFORD: Yeah. It was
a pleasure to meet you.

14:35.700 --> 14:36.788
We'll see you.
Thank you.

14:36.832 --> 14:37.920
Yes. See you again. David?

14:37.964 --> 14:40.880
You call me
if you need me.

14:46.407 --> 14:49.236
I've been on the phone
with Carla all day.

14:49.279 --> 14:52.152
She hasn't even
told the kids yet.

14:52.195 --> 14:53.414
She thinks

14:53.457 --> 14:54.894
that might make it too real.

14:54.937 --> 14:57.635
She, uh, is
absolutely devastated.

14:57.679 --> 14:59.550
We all are.[cell phone ringing]

14:59.594 --> 15:01.770
ABETEMARCO:
Sorry, I got to take this.

15:03.119 --> 15:04.729
DAVID:
Now, um,

15:04.773 --> 15:05.861
what's going on?

15:05.905 --> 15:07.167
You said this might be connected

15:07.210 --> 15:10.126
to the Hoff Construction case,
of all things?

15:10.170 --> 15:12.520
Do you know
of any new developments?

15:12.563 --> 15:13.869
There was no case left.

15:13.913 --> 15:16.741
Uh, I have no idea
why Jenny Egan would be

15:16.785 --> 15:20.093
meeting Robert at a dive bar
in the middle of the night.

15:20.136 --> 15:21.224
It's...

15:21.268 --> 15:22.617
ABETEMARCO: Well,
that was Connolly.

15:22.660 --> 15:24.967
They think they located
our shooter.

15:25.011 --> 15:26.273
He died at St. Mary's Hospital.

15:26.316 --> 15:29.189
So McQueen's shot
found its target.

15:29.232 --> 15:30.320
Looks that way.

15:30.364 --> 15:31.756
You have an I.D. on him?

15:31.800 --> 15:33.367
Record a mile long.

15:33.410 --> 15:34.498
Mob-connected.

15:35.847 --> 15:37.197
You think
it might've been a hit?

15:37.240 --> 15:38.111
Four people
connected to the case

15:38.154 --> 15:39.547
have died so far.

15:39.590 --> 15:41.027
It's a fair assumption.

15:41.070 --> 15:43.725
Someone really doesn't want
these people to talk.

15:43.768 --> 15:45.248
That's for sure.

15:54.562 --> 15:57.739
That Joint Operations Center
is state-of-the-art.

15:57.782 --> 16:00.133
Chicago and Los Angeles
are the only other departments

16:00.176 --> 16:01.612
that have one.

16:01.656 --> 16:04.050
There's pretty much nothing
we can't do from up here.

16:04.093 --> 16:06.052
LENNY: Oh, it's very,
very impressive.

16:06.095 --> 16:09.098
Your, uh, your Detective Baker--
she's very pretty.

16:09.142 --> 16:10.143
She married?

16:10.186 --> 16:11.144
Happily.

16:11.187 --> 16:13.015
As are you, last you said.

16:13.059 --> 16:14.886
Hey, just 'cause you already
ordered doesn't mean you can't

16:14.930 --> 16:16.627
still look at the menu.Can't look at the menu.

16:16.671 --> 16:18.629
Except nowadays,

16:18.673 --> 16:21.023
I need glasses
and a brighter light.

16:21.067 --> 16:22.329
No, but you look good.

16:22.372 --> 16:23.634
Really good.

16:23.678 --> 16:25.810
Not as good as me, but good.[chuckles]

16:25.854 --> 16:27.334
Do you want something?
You want coffee?

16:27.377 --> 16:28.639
Anything? Water?

16:28.683 --> 16:31.338
How about peanuts--
you got them?

16:31.381 --> 16:32.469
Peanuts?

16:32.513 --> 16:34.210
Yeah, for the elephant
in the room.

16:34.254 --> 16:36.908
Come on, Frankie,
I know you.

16:36.952 --> 16:38.606
You read the book
the minute you got home.

16:38.649 --> 16:41.174
And no call?
Not a peep.

16:45.004 --> 16:48.442
Tell me something, Len.

16:48.485 --> 16:50.183
What'd you think I'd say?

16:50.226 --> 16:52.489
Well, I'd hoped
that you'd be flattered.

16:52.533 --> 16:53.795
Honored even.

16:53.838 --> 16:56.276
No one loves going back there
more than you.

16:56.319 --> 16:57.712
Yeah, in a bar over drinks.

16:57.755 --> 16:59.888
Why do you think
we get a private room though?

16:59.931 --> 17:01.237
So no one else can hear.

17:01.281 --> 17:03.109
Lenny, I got a granddaughter,

17:03.152 --> 17:04.327
grandsons.

17:04.371 --> 17:06.025
[laughs]:
What? What is it?

17:06.068 --> 17:09.941
The part about the two stews
at the Hotel Oswald?

17:09.985 --> 17:11.943
We were young, single
and off-duty.

17:11.987 --> 17:14.685
Who cares?
What does it matter?

17:14.729 --> 17:16.296
Look,

17:16.339 --> 17:18.733
I'll take that part out
if you want.

17:20.735 --> 17:23.520
It's not that.
It's the whole thing.

17:23.564 --> 17:26.828
"The whole thing"?

17:26.871 --> 17:28.569
Wow.

17:28.612 --> 17:30.788
Just tell me something, Lenny.

17:30.832 --> 17:32.790
Why'd you write it?

17:32.834 --> 17:35.532
And why'd you leave
everything in?

17:35.576 --> 17:38.405
I want people to know
what we did.

17:38.448 --> 17:41.103
I'm proud of it.

17:41.147 --> 17:43.018
This city was an ugly mess,

17:43.062 --> 17:45.847
and-and we took it back
block by block.

17:45.890 --> 17:48.154
But our methods were
exactly what everybody

17:48.197 --> 17:50.156
is up in arms against now.

17:50.199 --> 17:52.114
But, Frank, that was then.
How else could you read it?

17:52.158 --> 17:53.115
From where I sit?

17:53.159 --> 17:54.856
Every enemy I have--

17:54.899 --> 17:56.814
and there's a line
around the block--

17:56.858 --> 18:00.731
will brandish your book
as the bible of who I really am.

18:00.775 --> 18:01.689
Was.

18:01.732 --> 18:03.212
Too fine a point.

18:03.256 --> 18:05.301
So...

18:05.345 --> 18:06.389
you're worried
about what?

18:06.433 --> 18:07.999
That people
aren't gonna think

18:08.043 --> 18:11.742
that you became top cop
by immaculate conception?

18:11.786 --> 18:13.135
It's not about me.

18:13.179 --> 18:14.136
Really?

18:14.180 --> 18:15.224
No, it's not.

18:15.268 --> 18:17.139
It's about this office,

18:17.183 --> 18:19.141
not the man in it.

18:19.185 --> 18:21.230
Look, Lenny, I...

18:21.274 --> 18:23.145
I'd love to give you
my blessing,

18:23.189 --> 18:26.148
but I am certain
that publishing your book

18:26.192 --> 18:27.671
will hurt this office.

18:27.715 --> 18:29.151
I'm pretty certain
you've been drinking

18:29.195 --> 18:31.632
a little too much
of your own Kool-Aid.

18:31.675 --> 18:34.200
That ain't fair.

18:34.243 --> 18:36.724
You know what?

18:38.508 --> 18:40.249
This was just a courtesy.

18:40.293 --> 18:42.295
Everything in that book
was accurate.

18:42.338 --> 18:44.688
I don't need your permission
to publish it.

18:46.690 --> 18:49.258
My lawyers say different.

18:51.260 --> 18:54.611
Well, I have lawyers, too,
Frank.

18:54.655 --> 18:56.352
Maybe they should have

18:56.396 --> 18:58.180
a conversation
in a private room.

18:58.224 --> 19:00.182
I don't want it to go this way.

19:00.226 --> 19:01.749
Me neither, brother,
believe me.

19:01.792 --> 19:04.447
But, hey...

19:04.491 --> 19:06.232
it is what it is.

19:08.712 --> 19:10.714
I'll see you.

19:12.281 --> 19:14.283
[door closes]

19:20.289 --> 19:22.465
A burner phone was found
in our shooter's pocket.

19:22.509 --> 19:23.901
I want to have it dumped,

19:23.945 --> 19:25.512
get the call history.

19:25.555 --> 19:27.340
Find out who might have
ordered those hits?

19:27.383 --> 19:28.819
That's the idea.

19:30.821 --> 19:32.519
Look, I kicked this upstairs,

19:32.562 --> 19:35.217
told them we wanted to continue
the investigation...

19:35.261 --> 19:36.349
And they want you to back off.

19:38.655 --> 19:40.091
That it had been
referred to D.O.I.

19:40.135 --> 19:42.050
Yeah. How'd you know?

19:42.093 --> 19:44.618
I worked another
Sandy construction case

19:44.661 --> 19:46.272
in Brooklyn.

19:46.315 --> 19:49.884
And it never made it
to the grand jury either.

19:49.927 --> 19:51.277
What happened?

19:51.320 --> 19:54.367
They told me the same thing
that they told you.

19:54.410 --> 19:56.020
And I never heard
about it again.

19:56.064 --> 19:57.892
And I asked,
believe me.

19:59.676 --> 20:01.461
You think they're burying it?

20:02.375 --> 20:04.681
What the hell is going on here?

20:04.725 --> 20:06.727
The message is clear.

20:06.770 --> 20:08.381
We're gonna be pissing off

20:08.424 --> 20:10.731
the wrong people.

20:10.774 --> 20:13.299
I'm in if you are.

20:13.342 --> 20:15.388
We're burying a friend tomorrow.

20:15.431 --> 20:17.868
I don't think we have
much of a choice.

20:17.912 --> 20:19.130
Let's see
who the shooter called.

20:19.174 --> 20:20.480
We'll take it from there.

20:29.706 --> 20:30.881
Hey.

20:30.925 --> 20:32.187
Hey, you do what I said?

20:32.231 --> 20:33.275
You put the ipecac
on his brownie?

20:33.319 --> 20:34.798
Yeah, the goon
wolfed it right down.

20:34.842 --> 20:36.670
Really? Did he even have time
to make it to the john?

20:36.713 --> 20:38.367
Oh, no. It was so gross.

20:38.411 --> 20:39.281
He puked right there.

20:39.325 --> 20:41.109
Yes!
Huge crowd gathered.

20:41.152 --> 20:43.372
And I said,
"Everything come out all right?"

20:43.416 --> 20:44.808
Boom.

20:44.852 --> 20:47.289
Yeah, and then I said,
"Find yourself a new nerd."

20:47.333 --> 20:48.856
Everyone was pointing, laughing.

20:48.899 --> 20:50.292
Turns out I wasn't the only one

20:50.336 --> 20:51.902
he was all over.
I bet.

20:51.946 --> 20:53.339
Yeah.
I'm really pleased
about this.

20:53.382 --> 20:54.557
Yeah, so am I.

20:54.601 --> 20:56.167
Did he snitch
or anything like that?

20:56.211 --> 20:57.256
Mm-mm, no.

20:57.299 --> 20:58.344
He was too busy throwing up.

20:58.387 --> 21:00.215
[both chuckle]

21:00.259 --> 21:01.390
What's so funny, guys?

21:01.434 --> 21:02.522
Nothing.
Mm.

21:02.565 --> 21:04.219
All right, well,
where's the silverware?

21:04.263 --> 21:06.265
Come on, we don't
eat with our hands.

21:11.226 --> 21:12.749
Got to look at every detail.

21:12.793 --> 21:14.490
Never know
what's gonna be important.

21:14.534 --> 21:16.187
We've been staring
at the same block

21:16.231 --> 21:17.406
for the last eight hours.

21:17.450 --> 21:19.408
It's getting important
that I got to pee.

21:19.452 --> 21:21.410
All part of detective work.

21:21.454 --> 21:23.282
Yeah, the boring part.

21:23.325 --> 21:25.414
Well, making big cases
isn't boring.

21:25.458 --> 21:28.939
And neither is the salary
or the gold shield.

21:28.983 --> 21:30.332
I can't wait to get

21:30.376 --> 21:33.335
a perp in the box,
match wits, you know?

21:33.379 --> 21:34.815
Is that our suspect?

21:36.817 --> 21:38.471
JANKO:
Uh, I don't think so.

21:38.514 --> 21:42.083
Roger Jeffers is at least
ten years older.

21:42.126 --> 21:44.172
But that is
Mother Jeffers though,

21:44.215 --> 21:47.218
right on time for her shift
at the hospital.

21:53.529 --> 21:55.923
You wouldn't miss patrol
at all, Eddie?

21:55.966 --> 21:58.186
Being out on the street?

21:58.229 --> 22:02.364
Uh, EDPs, the drunks,
domestic calls?

22:02.408 --> 22:04.758
Honestly, I think the only thing
that I would miss

22:04.801 --> 22:06.412
is hanging out with you.

22:17.161 --> 22:19.120
Might as well call it in.

22:19.163 --> 22:21.340
Roger Jeffers isn't
showing his face tonight.

22:21.383 --> 22:23.342
Not here anyway.[engine starts]

22:29.435 --> 22:31.219
So what's up?

22:31.262 --> 22:32.786
You said you had something?

22:32.829 --> 22:34.788
Yeah, grab a seat.
You want a beer?

22:34.831 --> 22:36.398
I'm about to start my tour.

22:36.442 --> 22:39.532
Okay, we dumped
the shooter's burner phone.

22:39.575 --> 22:41.708
Made four calls,
one to the Chinese delivery,

22:41.751 --> 22:43.579
the other three
to a mystery phone.

22:43.623 --> 22:46.495
The last call
an hour before the shooting.

22:46.539 --> 22:48.279
Yeah, it turned out
to be a pay phone

22:48.323 --> 22:50.978
outside of 5934 West End Avenue.

22:51.021 --> 22:53.807
I know the address because
we schlepped up there yesterday.

22:53.850 --> 22:55.417
Who were you seeing?

22:55.461 --> 22:56.679
David Harris, the ADA.

22:56.723 --> 22:58.333
The phone's right outside
the duplex

22:58.377 --> 23:00.466
that he shares
with his father.

23:00.509 --> 23:02.511
You mean Stanford Harris?Yeah.

23:02.555 --> 23:04.513
ABETEMARCO: You know, we
can't imagine why the shooter

23:04.557 --> 23:06.254
would have contact
with either one of them,

23:06.297 --> 23:07.864
but maybe they were
being surveilled.

23:07.908 --> 23:09.475
David Harris might be a target

23:09.518 --> 23:11.085
because he was
the agent...
Wait a second,
wait a second.

23:11.128 --> 23:13.087
What case are you
investigating here?

23:13.130 --> 23:15.045
Some kind of conspiracy?

23:15.089 --> 23:16.960
Look, there's four deaths
connected to the Hoff Constru...

23:17.004 --> 23:20.268
'Cause my case was the
double at McFane's Pub,

23:20.311 --> 23:21.835
and we solved that;
that's a win.

23:21.878 --> 23:23.445
Stanford Harris?

23:23.489 --> 23:24.577
Hit men?

23:24.620 --> 23:26.013
Why would you ever
go down that hole?

23:26.056 --> 23:27.493
To find out
what the hell is going on.

23:27.536 --> 23:29.451
Hey, we lost a brother
here, Connelly.

23:29.495 --> 23:33.847
I know, but... the truth is,
you have nothing.

23:33.890 --> 23:36.502
Anyone on the planet could have
picked up that pay phone.

23:36.545 --> 23:39.374
Who the hell knows?

23:39.418 --> 23:41.507
Somebody say
something to you?

23:41.550 --> 23:43.465
Say something?
Yeah.

23:43.509 --> 23:45.772
What do you mean by that?

23:45.815 --> 23:48.601
This is the first
I'm hearing about it.

23:48.644 --> 23:52.648
Look, Erin, nothing's
gonna bring McQueen back.

23:52.692 --> 23:55.651
And this is way above
our pay grades.

23:55.695 --> 23:57.479
I'm not risking my
pension poking around,

23:57.523 --> 23:58.524
and neither should you.

24:00.613 --> 24:02.049
Screw him.

24:02.092 --> 24:04.051
He only cares about his own ass.

24:04.094 --> 24:05.879
Yeah, well, he's right
about one thing.

24:05.922 --> 24:10.361
We take this on, we need
much harder evidence than this.

24:26.247 --> 24:28.249
I owe you an apology.

24:28.292 --> 24:29.772
Wow.

24:29.816 --> 24:32.209
Stop the presses.

24:32.253 --> 24:34.342
You owe me an apology.

24:34.385 --> 24:36.170
Imagine that.

24:36.213 --> 24:37.214
I'm being serious.

24:37.258 --> 24:39.347
We should have
told you the truth

24:39.390 --> 24:41.001
about Jack's eye
from the beginning.

24:41.044 --> 24:45.266
It was just, he was scared that
you would be... disappointed.

24:45.309 --> 24:46.833
Mm-hmm.

24:46.876 --> 24:49.270
He was scared I would be
disappointed he lost the fight.

24:49.313 --> 24:52.839
Then you were scared
that I would fly off the handle,

24:52.882 --> 24:55.537
drag him out to the garage
and prepare him for combat.

24:55.581 --> 24:57.321
Mm.

24:58.932 --> 25:01.325
But he did say that you...

25:01.369 --> 25:03.414
you gave him
some really good advice.

25:03.458 --> 25:06.896
You solved the situation
in a constructive way.

25:06.940 --> 25:07.897
Hmm.

25:07.941 --> 25:09.682
Did he say how?

25:09.725 --> 25:12.380
He said it was
between you two.

25:12.423 --> 25:13.512
Hmm.

25:13.555 --> 25:16.036
And I respect that.
I do, you know?

25:16.079 --> 25:17.472
Good.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.126
Poor guy's been
so miserable.

25:19.169 --> 25:21.650
I'm just glad
that you figured it out.

25:21.694 --> 25:24.740
Me, too. He's a good kid.

25:24.784 --> 25:26.176
Hey.

25:27.787 --> 25:31.225
I am sorry
that I underestimated you.

25:31.268 --> 25:33.270
It's okay.

25:34.489 --> 25:36.447
Just don't let it
happen again,

25:36.491 --> 25:38.449
or I'm gonna have
to spank you next time.

25:38.493 --> 25:40.321
[scoffs]

25:41.888 --> 25:44.847
Danny, we're on
our way to church.

25:44.891 --> 25:46.283
I said next time.

25:46.327 --> 25:47.589
[laughs]Get out of here.

25:50.723 --> 25:54.117
What do you say is the most
realistic cop story ever told?

25:54.161 --> 25:56.380
Let's see,
most realistic cop story.

25:56.424 --> 25:57.991
Guess I'd have
to say Serpico.

25:58.034 --> 25:59.645
Ah, movie or book?

25:59.688 --> 26:03.518
Both. Book by Peter Maas,
movie by Sidney Lumet.

26:03.562 --> 26:04.780
HENRY:
I knew Serpico.

26:04.824 --> 26:07.609
He really was that whiny
and self-righteous.

26:07.653 --> 26:10.003
Yeah, but he blew the whistle
on some pretty nasty stuff.

26:10.046 --> 26:11.744
Guy was a hero in his own way.

26:11.787 --> 26:13.746
Well, that's 'cause
he was played by Al Pacino

26:13.789 --> 26:15.486
giving us
his most magnetic Pacino.

26:15.530 --> 26:17.619
You're in the minority
on that one, Pop.

26:17.663 --> 26:20.230
Yeah?JAMIE: For me, The Onion
Fieldwas the real deal.

26:20.274 --> 26:21.841
The New Centurions,too.

26:21.884 --> 26:23.538
Mm.

26:23.582 --> 26:25.409
Because they were both written
by Joseph Wambaugh,

26:25.453 --> 26:26.497
a man who actually
was on the job.

26:26.541 --> 26:27.934
I say French Connection.

26:27.977 --> 26:30.458
You got "Popeye" Doyle,
realistic detective work,

26:30.501 --> 26:33.287
and the second best car
chase in movie history,

26:33.330 --> 26:34.984
after Bullittof course.

26:35.028 --> 26:36.377
What about 21
Jump Street?

26:36.420 --> 26:38.422
What planet are you on?

26:38.466 --> 26:39.989
That's a comedy, genius.

26:40.033 --> 26:42.209
And at least that movie
came out this century.

26:42.252 --> 26:43.950
[Erin laughs]Sean.

26:43.993 --> 26:45.952
My favorite is actually
a made-for-TV one.

26:45.995 --> 26:47.388
Saw it when I was a kid.

26:47.431 --> 26:48.476
Boys in Blue.

26:48.519 --> 26:49.869
Boys in Blue?

26:49.912 --> 26:51.348
Yeah, Robert Conrad

26:51.392 --> 26:54.525
was chasing these jewel thieves
in the Riviera,

26:54.569 --> 26:56.353
looking so cool
in his turtleneck.

26:56.397 --> 26:58.617
You know the one I mean?HENRY: Know it? I lived it.

26:58.660 --> 26:59.879
They got it all wrong.

26:59.922 --> 27:01.402
What do you mean?

27:01.445 --> 27:03.012
HENRY:
That story was about me.

27:03.056 --> 27:04.492
The Hotel Pierre heist.

27:04.535 --> 27:06.755
I mean, Robert Conrad
was my character?

27:06.799 --> 27:07.669
Come on.

27:07.713 --> 27:09.366
I didn't know that.

27:09.410 --> 27:10.716
They cast Robert
Conrad to play you?

27:10.759 --> 27:12.587
That's not right.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.067
You're telling me
it's not right.

27:14.110 --> 27:15.546
Yeah, they should've got someone
more handsome at least.

27:15.590 --> 27:17.548
Yeah, like, uh,
Paul Newman.

27:17.592 --> 27:18.767
Paul Newman.ERIN: Paul Newman.

27:18.811 --> 27:20.726
"Baby Blues."

27:20.769 --> 27:22.162
Now, that would've been
perfect casting.

27:23.250 --> 27:25.339
[all chuckling]

27:26.427 --> 27:28.385
[chuckles]

27:28.429 --> 27:30.170
Okay, Francis.

27:30.213 --> 27:33.521
Very funny.
Very, very funny.

27:33.564 --> 27:36.480
You'll get yours.

27:40.746 --> 27:42.573
DANNY:
Okay.

27:42.617 --> 27:45.489
So, basically, you gave
out a few wood shampoos,

27:45.533 --> 27:47.622
rousted a few black
and Latino gangs,

27:47.666 --> 27:50.277
fooled around with some girls
and took meals on the arm.

27:50.320 --> 27:51.452
Basically.

27:51.495 --> 27:54.107
You ever kill anyone?

27:54.150 --> 27:55.761
Steal anything?
Get strung out?

27:55.804 --> 27:57.414
No, nothing like that.

27:57.458 --> 27:59.416
Well, then all this
book says to me, then,

27:59.460 --> 28:01.723
is that you're like every
other good cop I ever met.

28:01.767 --> 28:03.638
Yeah, but I'm not just
any cop now.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.596
Look, Dad, you want an opinion,

28:05.640 --> 28:07.250
you should actually
let us read the book.

28:07.294 --> 28:09.383
Oh, you two aren't reading it.

28:09.426 --> 28:10.732
Why not?

28:10.776 --> 28:14.562
Because there's personal stuff
in there, too.

28:14.605 --> 28:16.782
Your mom and me,
battles I had with Pop.

28:16.825 --> 28:19.741
Stuff I chose
not to share.

28:19.785 --> 28:23.484
And now I'm supposed to share it
with the whole world?

28:23.527 --> 28:25.660
All due respect, sounds like
you already made up your mind,

28:25.704 --> 28:27.488
so why ask us?

28:27.531 --> 28:29.577
Because him and
Lenny are tight.

28:29.620 --> 28:31.753
Were, back in the day.

28:31.797 --> 28:35.365
Are, or you wouldn't be
sweating it out.

28:37.367 --> 28:39.500
I guess.

28:39.543 --> 28:42.416
Sounds like maybe
he stepped on the line.

28:42.459 --> 28:45.071
Every cop's
war story should be

28:45.114 --> 28:49.075
his to share or not share
however he wants.

28:49.118 --> 28:50.816
But he's still your friend,
that's clear.

28:50.859 --> 28:52.600
I know I wouldn't
want my adventures

28:52.643 --> 28:54.428
out there for anyone
and everyone to read.

28:54.471 --> 28:55.821
FRANK: [chuckles]
That's for sure.

28:55.864 --> 28:56.952
And I'm just me.

28:56.996 --> 28:58.562
You're... [chuckles]
you're you.

28:58.606 --> 29:00.739
What's that supposed
to mean-- I'm me?

29:00.782 --> 29:04.655
You're, like, you know,
the Pope of cops.

29:04.699 --> 29:07.441
Yeah. Infallible.

29:12.620 --> 29:14.840
[knocking on door]

29:16.972 --> 29:21.542
CCTV footage from 5934 West End
Avenue the night of the double.

29:21.585 --> 29:22.935
Got a minute to watch?

29:22.978 --> 29:24.675
Of course.

29:29.593 --> 29:31.378
Okay, the fourth
and final call

29:31.421 --> 29:34.381
from the burner
phone was made at...

29:34.424 --> 29:37.427
23:36 hours.

29:37.471 --> 29:39.516
I can't see his face.

29:39.560 --> 29:43.564
Phone should ring
right... now.

29:49.570 --> 29:51.615
Stanford Harris?

29:51.659 --> 29:53.966
I don't get it.

29:54.009 --> 29:55.402
Me neither.

29:55.445 --> 29:56.577
Why would
the shooter possibly

29:56.620 --> 29:59.580
have contact with
Stanford Harris?

29:59.623 --> 30:01.408
And why would he have
ordered the hits?

30:01.451 --> 30:02.757
It doesn't make
any sense.

30:02.801 --> 30:05.760
There might be a reason.

30:05.804 --> 30:08.894
I mean, everything leads back
to Hoff Construction, right?

30:08.937 --> 30:11.853
Stanford Harris has
a connection to that.

30:11.897 --> 30:12.854
Which was?

30:12.898 --> 30:14.682
After Hurricane Sandy,

30:14.725 --> 30:16.249
he led a delegation
to Albany.

30:16.292 --> 30:20.688
He secured three billion
in state aid to repair damages.

30:20.731 --> 30:23.691
And the bids Hoff Construction
were accused of rigging

30:23.734 --> 30:26.259
were for the
Sandy rebuild.

30:26.302 --> 30:29.305
Did Stanford Harris control
who got the contracts?

30:29.349 --> 30:31.003
Did he allocate the funds?

30:31.046 --> 30:33.135
I mean, he certainly
has the juice.

30:33.179 --> 30:34.310
For sure.

30:34.354 --> 30:35.616
Seems like a conflict
of interest at best

30:35.659 --> 30:39.446
to assign David, the son,
to a corruption case

30:39.489 --> 30:41.491
where the father
might be implicated.

30:41.535 --> 30:42.797
Eh, Stanford's been
pushing the kid

30:42.841 --> 30:44.103
up the ladder
his whole career.

30:44.146 --> 30:45.582
That was just
one more move.

30:47.454 --> 30:49.717
So David's role...

30:52.633 --> 30:54.635
David.

30:57.072 --> 31:01.294
I, uh... guess we, uh,
need to talk.

31:01.337 --> 31:03.122
I'm, um...

31:03.165 --> 31:06.168
I'm gonna go call my lawyer.

31:20.313 --> 31:22.315
â™ª

31:37.460 --> 31:39.593
David! David!
What are you doing?!

31:39.636 --> 31:40.681
Give me...
No!

31:40.724 --> 31:41.638
No!

31:41.682 --> 31:43.031
Give me...
give me the gun!

31:43.075 --> 31:44.990
What the hell is going on?!

31:45.033 --> 31:47.688
[panting]

31:47.731 --> 31:50.865
Why would you ever
want to do that?

31:50.909 --> 31:53.128
Oh, God.

31:53.172 --> 31:54.173
Oh, my God.

31:54.216 --> 31:55.304
Look at me.

31:56.349 --> 31:58.133
Look at me, David.

31:58.177 --> 31:59.961
Talk to us.

32:00.005 --> 32:03.399
We already know everything,
so you might as well just

32:03.443 --> 32:05.314
get it off your chest.

32:10.015 --> 32:13.714
You slipped your father
the confidential witness list

32:13.757 --> 32:15.063
on the Hoff case.

32:15.107 --> 32:17.674
He took it from there.

32:17.718 --> 32:20.764
I swear I didn't know
anybody was gonna get hurt.

32:20.808 --> 32:23.767
Robert McQueen
was my friend.

32:23.811 --> 32:26.945
I know his wife.

32:26.988 --> 32:29.686
I know his children.

32:29.730 --> 32:31.732
And, uh...Your father

32:31.775 --> 32:36.780
was covering up for kickbacks
on three billion in Sandy aid.

32:36.824 --> 32:38.391
That's what he didn't
want to come out

32:38.434 --> 32:40.828
if the case went to trial.

32:40.871 --> 32:43.657
He had four people killed,
David, including McQueen.

32:43.700 --> 32:46.747
You can't take the weight
for that.

32:48.531 --> 32:51.795
You want to save yourself?

32:54.842 --> 32:56.670
Yes.

32:56.713 --> 32:59.978
Then you know
what you have to do.

33:08.899 --> 33:11.293
Mother Jeffers is
running late tonight.

33:11.337 --> 33:13.730
Maybe she changed
her shift.

33:13.774 --> 33:15.689
JANKO:
No.

33:15.732 --> 33:17.821
Looks like she's just
grabbing the next one.

33:17.865 --> 33:20.172
DISPATCHER [over radio]:
All units, we got a 10-13

33:20.215 --> 33:22.043
at Building 4,
Parksdale Projects.

33:22.087 --> 33:23.175
Officer needs assistance.

33:23.218 --> 33:24.437
All units responding.[engine starts]

33:24.480 --> 33:25.742
Parksdale Projects is, like,
two blocks away.

33:25.786 --> 33:27.005
We should take it.

33:27.048 --> 33:28.702
Rivera told us to sit tight
no matter what.

33:28.745 --> 33:29.920
We should let
someone else grab it.

33:29.964 --> 33:30.921
Eddie, it's two days

33:30.965 --> 33:32.314
after the woman's birthday.

33:32.358 --> 33:34.316
Roger Jeffers isn't gonna be
showing up tonight.

33:34.360 --> 33:36.710
Look at her;
she's just going to work.

33:36.753 --> 33:38.712
DISPATCHER:
Repeat. All units, 10-13.

33:38.755 --> 33:41.845
It's a 10-13.
We're taking it.

33:41.889 --> 33:44.935
[engine stops]

33:46.676 --> 33:49.027
Reagan!

33:52.160 --> 33:53.118
[sighs]

33:53.161 --> 33:54.728
[line ringing]

33:54.771 --> 33:56.469
Detective?

33:56.512 --> 33:57.644
RIVERA:
What do you got, Janko?

33:57.687 --> 33:59.559
Uh, Roger Jeffers' mom

33:59.602 --> 34:00.821
isn't wearing
her nurse's uniform.

34:00.864 --> 34:02.431
She might just be
changing there,

34:02.475 --> 34:04.651
but I... I thought
I should report it.

34:04.694 --> 34:06.653
We call that a hunch.

34:06.696 --> 34:09.873
Um, no, her-her bus
is here now.

34:09.917 --> 34:11.658
And she's getting on, as usual.

34:11.701 --> 34:14.095
I'm gonna send a car
to the hospital,

34:14.139 --> 34:15.531
see if she goes to work.

34:15.575 --> 34:16.967
We'll keep you apprised.

34:17.011 --> 34:18.360
Roger that.

34:21.842 --> 34:23.844
[sirens whooping,
indistinct police radio chatter]

34:26.238 --> 34:27.935
Hey, what's going on?
Everything okay?

34:27.978 --> 34:29.850
The 10-13 is a 10-90X.

34:29.893 --> 34:32.157
Unfounded?The lady who called--

34:32.200 --> 34:34.420
her father had a heart attack
and the ambulance wasn't coming.

34:34.463 --> 34:37.510
So she told 911 that a cop
got shot in the stairwell.

34:37.553 --> 34:39.860
And the cavalry came.
Her father live?

34:39.903 --> 34:41.296
Yeah, they saved him, but
she's getting collared

34:41.340 --> 34:42.515
for falsely reporting
an incident.

34:42.558 --> 34:43.994
You can't just yell
"fire" like that.

34:44.038 --> 34:45.822
Yeah.[phone chimes]

34:45.866 --> 34:46.997
[sighs]

34:56.181 --> 34:57.138
[doorbell jingles]

35:00.010 --> 35:01.664
Detective Rivera?

35:01.708 --> 35:05.059
Mom got off two stops after
the hospital, met her son here.

35:05.103 --> 35:06.060
We got him.

35:06.104 --> 35:07.975
[sighs]

35:08.018 --> 35:09.585
Good eye
and good cop instincts, Janko.

35:09.629 --> 35:10.847
That's how you do it.

35:10.891 --> 35:12.545
Thank you, Detective.

35:12.588 --> 35:14.373
Where's Reagan?

35:14.416 --> 35:17.245
He stayed back at the house
just in case she doubled back.

35:17.289 --> 35:19.595
Good. Really good work.

35:19.639 --> 35:22.990
Meet me at the squad; you
fill out the DD5, okay?

35:26.036 --> 35:27.516
Eddie!

35:27.560 --> 35:28.909
Jamie, we got him!
We got Jeffers!

35:28.952 --> 35:29.910
I don't care.

35:29.953 --> 35:31.912
Don't ever do that again.

35:31.955 --> 35:34.610
Don't do what?
What are you talking about?

35:34.654 --> 35:35.916
10-13 trumps
everything else, Eddie.

35:35.959 --> 35:37.918
But Rivera specifically told us
to stay put.

35:37.961 --> 35:40.181
Besides, I heard on the radio
that call was unfounded!

35:40.225 --> 35:42.183
You didn't know
that at the time.

35:42.227 --> 35:43.576
I don't get you.

35:43.619 --> 35:46.056
We got the guy,
and I covered for you

35:46.100 --> 35:47.667
with Rivera.

35:47.710 --> 35:48.668
Everything worked out.

35:48.711 --> 35:49.756
That's all you
care about?

35:49.799 --> 35:50.931
You're busy chasing a shield

35:50.974 --> 35:52.411
when a cop could've been
in trouble?

35:52.454 --> 35:56.284
I'm sorry, I'm not gonna
apologize for wanting a career.

35:56.328 --> 35:58.939
Well, I need a partner
I can trust.

35:58.982 --> 36:01.115
So you ever sit out
a 10-13 again,

36:01.159 --> 36:04.031
you can find somebody else
to ride with.

36:08.078 --> 36:09.297
[scoffs quietly]

36:10.516 --> 36:14.259
So after seven years
of asking for the car,

36:14.302 --> 36:17.087
she finally leaves it to me
in her will.

36:17.131 --> 36:20.134
Let's do this discreetly,
not cuff him in full view.

36:20.178 --> 36:22.136
Discreetly? This scumbag
killed my friend.

36:22.180 --> 36:23.529
His ass is mine.

36:23.572 --> 36:27.402
Senator Harris, could you come
with us, sir, please?

36:27.446 --> 36:30.144
Is everything all right?

36:30.188 --> 36:31.189
ABETEMARCO:
I'm having a great day.

36:32.973 --> 36:34.148
But you,

36:34.192 --> 36:35.671
you're under arrest.

36:35.715 --> 36:37.717
Under arrest?

36:37.760 --> 36:38.718
For what?

36:38.761 --> 36:39.893
Murder one, sir.

36:39.936 --> 36:43.070
If you could just
come with us, please.

36:43.113 --> 36:44.941
[laughs]

36:44.985 --> 36:46.943
Is this some kind of a joke?

36:46.987 --> 36:49.250
Call my lawyer,
make an appointment.

36:49.294 --> 36:50.773
This is outrageous.

36:50.817 --> 36:52.035
So...

36:52.079 --> 36:53.167
Come on, get up.

36:53.211 --> 36:54.603
Take your hands off of me!Get up!

36:54.647 --> 36:57.998
STANFORD: You want to add
a lawsuit to this?

36:58.041 --> 37:00.043
This is nothing, gentlemen.
I'll be out by dinner.

37:00.087 --> 37:02.045
You're throwing your
career away right now.

37:02.089 --> 37:03.177
I hope you know that.

37:03.221 --> 37:05.745
I don't care
who your father is,

37:05.788 --> 37:07.050
you're done.

37:07.094 --> 37:09.009
No, sir, you are.

37:09.052 --> 37:11.229
I don't know what you
think you have on me.

37:11.272 --> 37:14.057
I have a witness
who knows everything about you.

37:14.101 --> 37:15.015
[chuckles softly]

37:15.058 --> 37:18.627
No one knows
everything about me.

37:18.671 --> 37:21.064
Think harder.

37:21.108 --> 37:22.544
[camera clicks]

37:34.469 --> 37:36.079
Hey.

37:36.123 --> 37:38.125
Hey.

37:39.996 --> 37:42.782
I'm sorry things got
heated last night.

37:44.827 --> 37:47.265
Can I ask you something?

37:47.308 --> 37:49.223
Do you want to be
a detective or not?

37:49.267 --> 37:52.052
Maybe.

37:52.095 --> 37:53.314
What about the sergeant's exam?

37:53.358 --> 37:54.663
After law school,

37:54.707 --> 37:56.317
I swore I'd never take
another damn exam.

37:56.361 --> 37:59.146
So, what, you just want to ride
in an RMP for the next 20 years?

37:59.189 --> 38:00.756
Didn't say that.

38:00.800 --> 38:03.063
Could you be
a little more vague, Reagan?

38:03.106 --> 38:05.370
I like being on patrol, Eddie.

38:05.413 --> 38:06.980
For now.
I like the idea

38:07.023 --> 38:09.112
of actually preventing
something bad from happening,

38:09.156 --> 38:12.333
rather than just
mopping up after it.

38:12.377 --> 38:14.248
Again, for now.

38:15.031 --> 38:16.903
Okay.

38:16.946 --> 38:18.905
And something else.

38:18.948 --> 38:21.386
You didn't ask to get partnered
with me, I know that.

38:21.429 --> 38:23.388
I like being partnered with you.

38:23.431 --> 38:24.954
I think I know
that, too.

38:24.998 --> 38:27.653
But it puts you
in a kind of position,

38:27.696 --> 38:29.350
under a certain microscope,

38:29.394 --> 38:31.178
being partnered with
the PC's son.

38:31.221 --> 38:33.093
I'm sure that a lot of the brass
probably think

38:33.136 --> 38:36.139
that I might use that
to leverage moving up.

38:36.183 --> 38:37.227
I won't.

38:37.271 --> 38:38.228
I know.

38:38.272 --> 38:39.578
I got your back there, too.

38:39.621 --> 38:40.796
Thank you.

38:42.842 --> 38:44.191
Rivera gonna be your rabbi?

38:44.234 --> 38:47.150
I hope so.

38:47.194 --> 38:49.370
He wants me to work towards
getting my gold shield.

38:49.414 --> 38:51.416
Mission accomplished, then.

38:54.462 --> 38:55.942
We good?

38:55.985 --> 38:57.422
We're good.

38:57.465 --> 38:59.380
Okay, you do
what you have to do, okay?

38:59.424 --> 39:00.599
So will I.
Okay.

39:15.875 --> 39:19.095
If they'd told me it was you,
I would've come right down.

39:19.139 --> 39:20.967
All good.

39:22.316 --> 39:24.666
Listen, Frank, I'm already late
for the airport, so I, uh...

39:24.710 --> 39:27.408
This'll just
take a second.

39:27.452 --> 39:29.410
What's this, a subpoena?

39:29.454 --> 39:30.933
No.

39:30.977 --> 39:32.674
Well, what, then?

39:32.718 --> 39:35.460
Why would I serve you
with a subpoena, Lenny?

39:35.503 --> 39:37.766
Well, after dealing with your
lawyers for the last few days,

39:37.810 --> 39:39.115
I don't know what to expect.

39:39.159 --> 39:41.291
Yeah, well...

39:41.335 --> 39:43.250
that's going away.

39:43.293 --> 39:45.600
Well, the book isn't, Frank.

39:45.644 --> 39:48.516
I wrote a foreword.

39:48.560 --> 39:50.692
To the damn book.

39:50.736 --> 39:52.564
What?

39:52.607 --> 39:55.871
I don't write as good as you do,
but you can use it if you want.

39:55.915 --> 39:58.091
Why'd you change your mind?

39:58.134 --> 39:59.440
That's my business.

39:59.484 --> 40:01.181
Come on, Frankie.

40:01.224 --> 40:03.705
I tell you,
the whole world's gonna know.

40:03.749 --> 40:05.707
But...

40:05.751 --> 40:09.319
I'm not ashamed
of how I got to where I am,

40:09.363 --> 40:11.104
and I didn't get to where I am

40:11.147 --> 40:14.629
without living the life
that's in your book.

40:14.673 --> 40:16.631
No sense trying to hide it.

40:16.675 --> 40:19.155
They told you sit down,
and you stood up.

40:19.199 --> 40:21.419
Something like that.

40:21.462 --> 40:23.203
Thank you.

40:26.162 --> 40:28.208
[grunts]

40:28.251 --> 40:31.341
Love you.

40:31.385 --> 40:33.518
Listen, I'm already late
for my flight,

40:33.561 --> 40:35.258
so, uh, see you next trip?

40:35.302 --> 40:37.217
No, I'll give you a lift.

40:37.260 --> 40:38.523
No, no, you don't
have to do that.

40:38.566 --> 40:41.656
You know a faster way
to get to JFK from here?

40:41.700 --> 40:44.267
Lights and sirens?

40:44.311 --> 40:48.010
If you promise
not to write about it.

40:49.055 --> 40:51.013
