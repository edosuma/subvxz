<i>13 Bannerman Road is where</i>
<i>Sarah Jane Smith lives</i>

00:07.474 --> 00:10.777
<i>and it's home to things</i>
<i>way beyond your imagination.</i>

00:10.844 --> 00:14.214
<i>There's an extraterrestrial,</i>

00:17.617 --> 00:20.553
<i>a school girl investigator</i>
<i>across the road</i>

00:20.620 --> 00:24.591
<i>and a whole universe</i>

00:31.164 --> 00:32.698
-Ready?
-Always.

00:36.169 --> 00:38.138
The Doctor is dead.

00:38.204 --> 00:41.174
UNIT will take charge
of the funeral in conjunction
with the Shansheeth.

00:41.241 --> 00:42.509
It's Jo Grant, isn't it?

00:42.575 --> 00:44.310
It's a long time since
I've been called that.

00:44.377 --> 00:46.279
-Smelly getting closer!
-No, no, no, no, no!

00:46.346 --> 00:47.547
Closer and closer!

00:47.614 --> 00:49.816
Shansheeth.
This whole thing's a trap.

00:49.883 --> 00:53.953
This space is taken!

00:54.020 --> 00:55.955
So, gosh! That was different.
Hello, everyone!

00:56.022 --> 00:57.023
Who are you?

00:57.090 --> 00:58.458
Doctor!

00:58.525 --> 01:01.494
Ah, the Claw Shansheeth
of the 15th Funeral Fleet.

01:01.561 --> 01:02.662
I've been looking for you.

01:02.729 --> 01:05.565
Rest in peace!

01:24.451 --> 01:25.618
(ELECTRIC THROBBING)

01:25.685 --> 01:26.953
Sounds like a countdown.

(WHIRRING)

01:38.832 --> 01:40.700
But I was on a planet...

01:40.767 --> 01:42.602
No, no, never mind that. Run!

01:45.905 --> 01:46.973
Faster, faster, faster!

01:51.444 --> 01:52.579
Come along, Smith!

01:55.181 --> 01:57.283
No, no, no! Don't slow down.

01:57.350 --> 01:58.751
Take me back.

02:01.287 --> 02:02.055
In! In! In! In! In!

02:03.389 --> 02:04.791
I'm sorry. Is there a problem?

02:06.926 --> 02:10.395
Sorry, I was slamming it.

02:10.463 --> 02:13.399
Right! Now we need to lock it.
Come on,
use the sonic lipstick.

02:13.466 --> 02:15.034
-Haven't you got
the screwdriver?
-They took it.

02:15.101 --> 02:17.203
Wow, they do
sonic lipsticks now.

02:17.270 --> 02:18.805
DOCTOR: And I'll be
running out of time.

02:18.872 --> 02:20.573
-I need you, Sarah,
and you, Jo.
-Need us for what?

02:20.640 --> 02:22.909
Remember the old days
when we'd go zooming off
to faraway worlds?

02:32.585 --> 02:35.255
No, no, no, no.
Let's get you
working properly.

Stop, stop, stop!

02:36.422 --> 02:38.024
SARAH JANE: Where are we?

02:38.091 --> 02:40.360
DOCTOR: The Wasteland
of the Crimson Heart.

02:40.426 --> 02:44.163
Planet Earth's that way.
Bit of a long walk.
Sonic, please!

02:44.931 --> 02:45.899
Wow!

02:51.471 --> 02:54.807
Oh, so many years
since I was on another planet.

02:55.575 --> 02:56.543
Me, too.

02:57.777 --> 02:58.912
(DOCTOR CHUCKLES)

03:01.180 --> 03:03.950
I'm sorry, but can I help?
Is there something wrong?

03:04.017 --> 03:05.518
She's on our side, isn't she?

03:05.585 --> 03:08.254
Think about it. The Doctor's
been avoiding her, but why?

03:08.321 --> 03:10.924
'Cause someone inside UNIT
had to fake the DNA results.

03:10.990 --> 03:13.092
Colonel Karim. She's in league
with the Shansheeth.

03:15.728 --> 03:20.934
Not as daft as they look
for two batty old pensioners
and a bunch of ASBO kids.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.402
How on Earth did they
summon the Doctor?

03:22.468 --> 03:24.971
They have powers unforeseen.

03:25.872 --> 03:28.041
Right. First things first.

03:28.107 --> 03:31.711
We need to clear this place,
seal it off and keep
that lot trapped.

03:31.778 --> 03:34.347
Do you see? We're slap-bang
in the middle of the base.

03:34.414 --> 03:35.815
There's got to be a
way of getting help.

03:59.372 --> 04:02.175
Behold.
The Memory Weave is ready.

04:07.447 --> 04:09.549
Soon it will be active.

04:09.616 --> 04:12.318
Deliver the women
into our wings,

04:12.385 --> 04:18.324
and not even the Doctor
will be able to stop
the crusade of the Shansheeth!

There. And there.

(EQUIPMENT BUZZING)

04:22.929 --> 04:24.430
Did it hurt?

04:26.633 --> 04:27.567
No.

04:28.701 --> 04:29.869
I mean the regeneration.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.904
That last body of yours.

04:31.971 --> 04:33.106
Was he okay in the end?

04:34.507 --> 04:36.643
It always hurts. And there.

04:38.745 --> 04:40.279
So how did you end up
in this place?

04:40.346 --> 04:42.982
Ugh! The Shansheeth lured me.

04:43.049 --> 04:46.285
Mighty old battlefield,
just begging to be explored.

04:46.352 --> 04:49.355
'Cause I'm travelling
with Amy now and Rory.
They got married,

04:49.422 --> 04:52.358
so I dropped them off
at a honeymoon planet,
which isn't what you'd think.

04:52.425 --> 04:54.927
It's not a planet
for a honeymoon. It's a planet
on a honeymoon.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.396
It married an asteroid.

04:56.462 --> 04:57.497
(BOTH LAUGHING)

04:57.563 --> 04:58.931
Then they nicked the Tardis.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.034
The Shansheeth,
not Amy and, uh...

05:01.100 --> 05:02.835
Fortunately,
I had all this wreckage,

05:02.902 --> 05:05.304
to build a space swapping
doo-dah thing-a-ma-what's-it.

05:05.371 --> 05:07.674
So you've got a married
couple in the Tardis?

05:07.740 --> 05:09.442
Mr and Mrs Pond! (CHUCKLES)

05:09.509 --> 05:11.411
I only left you
because I got married.

05:14.213 --> 05:14.981
Um...

05:16.349 --> 05:18.718
Did you think I was stupid?

05:18.785 --> 05:22.722
-Why do you say that?
-Oh, well, I was a bit dumb.
(CHUCKLES)

05:22.789 --> 05:25.024
Still am, I suppose.

05:25.091 --> 05:29.829
Now what in the world
would make you think that?
Ever, ever, ever?

05:29.896 --> 05:33.866
We'd been travelling down
the Amazon for months,
and we reached a village

05:33.933 --> 05:37.637
in Cristalino, and it was
the only place in
thousands of miles

05:37.704 --> 05:41.140
that had a telephone,
so I called you.

05:41.207 --> 05:42.775
I just wanted to say hello.

05:42.842 --> 05:45.144
And they told me that
you'd left.

05:45.211 --> 05:49.382
Left UNIT, never came back.
So I waited.

05:49.449 --> 05:53.186
I waited because you said
you'd see me again.

05:53.252 --> 05:57.657
You did, I asked you and
you said, "Yes," you promised.

05:57.724 --> 06:02.595
So I thought, "Oh, one day,
I'd hear that sound.

06:02.662 --> 06:07.700
"Deep in the jungle, I'd hear
that funny wheezing noise, and

06:07.767 --> 06:12.672
"a big blue box,
right in the middle
of the rainforest.

just leave.

"Not me."

06:25.284 --> 06:27.520
I've waited
my whole silly life.

06:27.587 --> 06:28.788
Oh, but you're an idiot.

06:28.855 --> 06:30.356
Well, there we have it!

06:30.423 --> 06:33.392
No, no, no. But don't you see?
How could I ever find you?

06:33.459 --> 06:36.963
You've spent
the past 40 years
living in huts,

06:37.029 --> 06:38.965
climbing up trees,
tearing down barricades.

06:39.031 --> 06:42.135
You've done everything
from flying kites
on Kilimanjaro

06:42.201 --> 06:44.737
to sailing down the Yangtze
in a tea chest.

06:44.804 --> 06:46.739
Not even the Tardis
could pin you down.

06:46.806 --> 06:51.944
Hold on, I did sail down
the Yangtze in a tea chest!
How did you know?

06:52.011 --> 06:53.880
And that family.

06:53.946 --> 06:55.815
All seven kids,
12 grandchildren,
thirteenth on his way.

06:55.882 --> 06:58.551
He's dyslexic but that'll
be fine, great swimmer.

06:58.618 --> 07:00.853
So you've been watching me?

07:00.920 --> 07:02.655
All this time?

07:02.722 --> 07:03.623
No.

07:05.391 --> 07:08.861
Because you're right,
I don't look back. I can't.

07:08.928 --> 07:11.164
But the last time I was dying,
I looked back on all of you.

07:11.230 --> 07:12.832
Every single one.

07:14.700 --> 07:16.169
And I was so proud.

07:21.107 --> 07:25.578
It really is you, isn't it?
(CHUCKLES)

07:25.645 --> 07:27.413
-Hello.
-(SARAH JANE BLOWS WHISTLE)

07:27.480 --> 07:30.149
Sorry, but we've got that lot
back at home
with the Shansheeth.

07:30.216 --> 07:32.819
Yes! Yes!
And I still need you, Jo.

07:32.885 --> 07:37.223
Now, that bag of yours,
I can smell blackcurrant.
Is it buchu oil?

07:37.290 --> 07:39.792
Hand-picked in Mozambique!

07:39.859 --> 07:42.662
Oh, perfect! These circuits
need connectivity.

-Wonderful!
Little tiddly drop.

07:52.071 --> 07:53.639
Hurry, hurry, hurry! Come on!

07:53.706 --> 07:57.376
Hey, nice.
You've got a little den.
What's all the hurry for?

07:58.010 --> 07:59.478
Pizza, go cold.

07:59.545 --> 08:01.614
What?
I thought you had a plan.

08:01.681 --> 08:03.950
Shansheeth too scary. We hide.

08:04.016 --> 08:06.786
No, we've got to do something!

08:06.853 --> 08:10.723
Yeah, but hiding's not bad,
'cause we've got to
keep you safe, Clyde.

08:10.790 --> 08:12.158
See, whatever
the Doctor's doing,

08:12.225 --> 08:14.861
he needs you
for that body-switcheroo.

08:14.927 --> 08:17.496
Oh, great, great.
Stuck in Groskeville.

08:17.563 --> 08:18.998
Pizza good.

08:19.065 --> 08:20.867
I can't believe you get
to do this all the time.

08:20.933 --> 08:22.869
Like aliens and chases
and stuff.

08:22.935 --> 08:27.006
You can talk, Santiago.
You're off to
Paraguay and Mount Everest.

08:27.073 --> 08:29.709
Dude, you just zapped
into another planet.

08:29.775 --> 08:31.544
-Yeah, that was pretty cool.
-(ALL LAUGHING)

08:31.611 --> 08:36.148
Yeah,
we've been to parallel times,
dream dimensions, limbo.

08:36.215 --> 08:37.984
And then we go home for tea.

08:38.049 --> 08:40.653
Yeah, we see all of this,
then my mum's like,
"What did you do today?"

08:40.720 --> 08:42.221
And I'm like, "Not much."

08:42.288 --> 08:44.624
-"Yeah, went to the library."
-"Played a bit of footy."

08:44.690 --> 08:46.559
"Stayed behind
after Drama Club!"

08:46.626 --> 08:49.095
"Oh, yeah, and I fought off
a platoon of Judoon
in my spare time!"

08:51.030 --> 08:52.732
Not seen my mum
for six months now.

08:54.934 --> 08:56.235
How come?

08:56.302 --> 08:58.237
She's in Japan,
organising a rally.

08:58.304 --> 09:01.140
I mean, that's great,
you know,
it's really good work.

09:01.207 --> 09:02.742
Yeah, course it is.

09:02.808 --> 09:05.244
Before that she was in Africa,
finding shellflower plants.

09:05.311 --> 09:09.548
My father's with
the Gay Dads Organisation,
hiking across Antarctica.

09:09.615 --> 09:13.552
We haven't all been together
since about February?

09:13.619 --> 09:15.021
When are you going
to see them next?

09:15.087 --> 09:15.922
Soon.

09:18.324 --> 09:19.892
I don't know. Soon, though.

09:22.762 --> 09:24.297
What's that? What's happening?

09:24.363 --> 09:25.131
Trapped!

09:26.532 --> 09:28.034
Excellent.

09:28.100 --> 09:32.138
We've got the Brady Bunch
exactly where we need them.

09:32.204 --> 09:35.708
Now to apply a little heat.

09:35.775 --> 09:37.610

<i>Internal vents to maximum.</i>

09:39.211 --> 09:42.114
Heating! Hot, hot, hot!

09:42.181 --> 09:44.550
They're trying to boil us.

09:44.617 --> 09:46.585
COLONEL KARIM:
And increasing.

09:46.652 --> 09:48.754
The children are irrelevant.

09:48.821 --> 09:50.923
Not to the Doctor,
they're not.

09:51.123 --> 09:55.895
Wherever he is,
he'll be planning revenge.
We need to divert him.

09:57.730 --> 09:59.498
It won't budge!

09:59.565 --> 10:01.467
Come on, Groske, there's got
to be a way out!

10:01.534 --> 10:03.502
No! We die like rotisserie.

10:03.569 --> 10:05.338
Well, you can, but I'm not.

10:05.404 --> 10:08.541
Sarah Jane? Anyone?

10:08.607 --> 10:11.811
Doctor? Where are you?

10:12.778 --> 10:14.313
There! That should work.

10:14.380 --> 10:15.915
Intergalactic
molecular streaming,

10:15.982 --> 10:18.084
with just a hint
of blackcurrant.

10:18.150 --> 10:19.218
Oh, but what'll happen
to Clyde?

10:19.285 --> 10:20.319
Oh, no, no, no. I've fixed it.

10:20.386 --> 10:22.588
All I needed was you two.
Oil and sonic.

10:22.655 --> 10:25.725
Now we can go back, and
Clyde can stay where he is.

10:25.791 --> 10:26.726
Hold tight!

10:29.628 --> 10:31.197
Get us out of here!

10:31.263 --> 10:32.431
RANI: Sarah Jane!

10:32.498 --> 10:33.632
CLYDE: Doctor!

10:33.699 --> 10:35.935
Oops. Then again,
maybe leaving Clyde

10:36.135 --> 10:37.603
in the same place
wasn't such a good idea.

10:37.670 --> 10:38.604
Look out, stand back.

10:41.207 --> 10:43.075
Ah, ventilation shafts.

10:43.142 --> 10:45.478
That takes me back.
Or even forwards.

10:45.544 --> 10:47.747
CLYDE: Hurry up!
We're getting boiled alive.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.582
Hold on! We're coming!

10:49.648 --> 10:52.585
Don't worry, Santiago,
I'm here!

10:52.651 --> 10:54.887
You go first,
you've got the sonic lips...

10:57.390 --> 10:58.124
Argh!

10:59.091 --> 11:00.793
RANI: Doctor!

11:00.860 --> 11:02.862
Jo? Sarah?

11:02.928 --> 11:04.930
CLYDE: They're roasting us!

11:05.131 --> 11:06.432
Let us out!

11:09.535 --> 11:11.904
Sarah?
(YELLS)

11:15.241 --> 11:18.110
COLONEL KARIM:
Exactly as predicted.

11:18.177 --> 11:21.380
Given the choice between
saving the world or
saving the children,

11:21.447 --> 11:22.882
the Doctor goes the wrong way.

11:27.720 --> 11:29.922
Oh, I didn't trust you,
Colonel, from the moment
I met you.

11:30.122 --> 11:32.024
Like I care.

11:32.091 --> 11:35.761
Frankly, I've never met anyone
so staggeringly pious
in all my life.

11:36.896 --> 11:38.297
Now, then,

11:38.364 --> 11:40.199
the chamber's sealed off.

11:40.266 --> 11:43.135
The Doctor would need
half a ton of dynamite
to get through that.

11:43.202 --> 11:46.005
The Tardis! I never thought
I'd see it again.

11:46.072 --> 11:48.874
That's what this is all about.

11:48.941 --> 11:51.911
The Tardis and you.

11:54.346 --> 11:56.282
Place them
in the Memory Weave.

11:56.348 --> 11:57.083
(GRUNTING)

12:02.488 --> 12:04.924
And release.

12:07.359 --> 12:10.463
Blimey. You really have
changed faces, haven't you?

12:10.529 --> 12:12.364
I couldn't see you before.
I was too busy swapping.

12:12.431 --> 12:14.533
Oi, we're still cooking
back here!

12:14.600 --> 12:15.734
Where's my gran?

12:15.801 --> 12:17.403
Right, yes, sorry, uh...

12:17.470 --> 12:20.639
She's in danger, so
we'd better, uh...
Can't turn round.

12:20.706 --> 12:21.874
You'll have to
shuffle backwards.

12:21.941 --> 12:24.443
Oh, yes, okay.
Thank you, Clyde.

12:28.280 --> 12:30.082
Even your eyes are different.

12:30.149 --> 12:33.119
It's weird, 'cause I thought
the eyes would stay the same.

12:33.185 --> 12:34.787
Can you change colour or
are you always white?

12:34.854 --> 12:36.422
No, I could be anything.

12:36.489 --> 12:37.790
And is there a limit? I mean,
how many times can you change?

12:37.857 --> 12:38.924
-507.
-Oh.

12:44.830 --> 12:48.934
Well, come on, then. Tell us!
What exactly does
a Memory Weave do?

12:49.001 --> 12:52.138
'Cause I warn you, darling,
the memory's going at my age.

12:52.204 --> 12:54.573
You need remember
only one thing.

12:54.640 --> 12:58.177
-And what's that?
-The Tardis key.

12:58.244 --> 13:03.549
The Weave takes the memory
out of your head
and makes it real.

13:03.616 --> 13:08.320
This device can
build a physical key
out of your thoughts.

13:08.387 --> 13:12.992
And then, we will have access
to the Tardis.

13:13.058 --> 13:16.061
The most miraculous machine
in creation will be ours!

13:18.030 --> 13:18.898
No!

13:20.566 --> 13:21.534
(RUMBLING)

13:21.600 --> 13:22.902
They've started.

13:26.005 --> 13:28.908
No, you can't!
Ow!

13:28.974 --> 13:32.111
We have seen so much of death.

13:32.178 --> 13:36.715
The Shansheeth have presided
over infinite funerals.

13:36.782 --> 13:41.220
We see the pain and
the suffering again
and again and again.

13:41.287 --> 13:44.557
But with the Tardis,
we can stop this!

13:44.623 --> 13:49.361
We can intervene to prevent
the loss of life,
on the universal scale.

13:49.428 --> 13:50.462
You're going to stop death?

13:50.529 --> 13:52.498
It is a noble quest.

13:52.565 --> 13:56.902
To halt the endless,
endless weeping.

13:58.270 --> 14:00.039
And change
the whole of history!

14:00.105 --> 14:02.975
That's why creatures like you
can't have time machines.

14:03.042 --> 14:04.944
Because you'll wreck
the entire universe!

14:05.010 --> 14:06.245
What did I say?

14:06.312 --> 14:08.013
-Pious!
-Oh, yeah?

14:08.080 --> 14:12.151
But I'd rather be pious
than vile.

14:12.218 --> 14:15.221
What do you get out of this,
Colonel?

14:15.287 --> 14:18.924
A bigger horizon, Miss Smith.

14:18.991 --> 14:21.493
The Shansheeth
can take me to the stars,

14:21.560 --> 14:25.564
because there is nothing
left for me here on Earth.

14:27.333 --> 14:28.934
Not any more.

14:31.170 --> 14:32.771
Accelerate the Weave!

14:33.973 --> 14:36.976
(JO AND SARAH JANE GROANING)

14:39.445 --> 14:41.780
Oh, they've sealed it off.
Jo, Sarah! Can you hear me?

14:41.847 --> 14:44.350
They want the key.
They've got the Tardis,
and a Memory Weave.

14:44.416 --> 14:46.151
Too late. Full activation!

14:47.286 --> 14:49.688
Concentrate! Think of the key!

14:53.392 --> 14:54.126
Try to find a way in.

14:56.629 --> 14:57.863
There's nothing.

14:57.930 --> 14:59.765
We're gonna need a bulldozer.

14:59.832 --> 15:02.434
I've got the original here.
You can have it
if you let them go.

15:02.501 --> 15:05.671
You let the Doctor inside this
room and he will destroy us.

15:05.738 --> 15:06.739
Keep going!

15:06.805 --> 15:08.741
Think of the Tardis!

15:12.044 --> 15:12.911
(GRUNTS)

15:29.695 --> 15:32.298
The key. Remember the key!

15:32.364 --> 15:35.234
Fight it, Sarah Jane! Try to
think of something else.

15:35.301 --> 15:36.935
-I can't!
-Neither can I!

15:38.137 --> 15:39.505
It's not shifting!

15:40.839 --> 15:42.908
The memories coalesce.

15:49.381 --> 15:52.318
The key, it takes shape.

15:52.384 --> 15:54.520
Don't! Don't!

15:54.586 --> 15:56.855
I can't stop!

15:56.922 --> 15:58.724
What do we do, Doctor?
What do we do?

15:58.791 --> 16:02.294
Yes. Because

16:02.361 --> 16:04.697
-the Shansheeth are
making them remember...
-I know!

16:04.763 --> 16:06.965
-Then don't you see?
-I don't see anything!

16:07.032 --> 16:10.869
We do the same.
Opening comms. Yeah.
Sarah, Jo? Can you hear me?

16:10.936 --> 16:13.505
The key, it's almost ready.

16:15.007 --> 16:17.576
Listen to me. Both of you.
I want you to remember.

16:17.643 --> 16:20.312
We are doing it.
That's the trouble.

16:20.379 --> 16:22.214
No, no, no, no, no. I want you
to remember everything.

16:22.281 --> 16:25.551
Every single day with me.
Every single second.

16:25.617 --> 16:27.820
What's he doing?

16:27.886 --> 16:29.621
Because your memories
are more powerful than
anything else on this planet.

16:29.688 --> 16:32.624
Just think of it, Sarah.
Remember it, Jo. But properly!

16:32.691 --> 16:37.262
Properly!
Give the Memory Weave
everything. Every planet.

16:37.329 --> 16:40.866
Every face, every madman,
every loss, every sunset,

16:40.933 --> 16:43.936
every scent, every terror,
every joy,

16:44.002 --> 16:45.471
every Doctor.

16:45.537 --> 16:46.772
Every me.

16:47.539 --> 16:48.707

16:55.748 --> 16:58.417
-No!
-COMPUTER:

16:58.484 --> 16:59.785
I remember!

17:03.856 --> 17:07.092
We need that key!
What is happening?

17:14.133 --> 17:16.602
-What's happening?
-COMPUTER:
<i>Initial target lost.</i>

17:16.667 --> 17:18.704
SHANSHEETH BLUE: The device
is overloading!

17:18.771 --> 17:20.472
Too many memories.

17:20.539 --> 17:22.074
Too many!

17:22.141 --> 17:23.442
COLONEL KARIM: Reverse it!
Bring that key back!

17:23.509 --> 17:24.843
(LAUGHS)

17:24.910 --> 17:27.512
Come on, all of you.
Tell them, tell them!

17:27.579 --> 17:29.515
Think of us, Sarah Jane.

17:29.581 --> 17:34.253
Remember Maria and her dad,
and all the stuff we did,
like the Gorgon.

17:34.319 --> 17:37.756
And the clowns,
and the zodiac!
And the <i>Mona Lisa!</i>

17:37.823 --> 17:40.893
All of it. All of it!

17:50.702 --> 17:53.272
Just think, Gran.
All the countries
you've been to.

17:53.338 --> 17:55.641
Every country in the world.

I've got you.

18:09.354 --> 18:12.958
Now we're in trouble.
The Weave's going to blow up
and we can't get them out.

18:13.025 --> 18:14.026
What?

18:14.092 --> 18:17.663
Can't escape! I need the key!

18:22.267 --> 18:24.002
I can't unseal the doors.

The power line is gone.

18:28.807 --> 18:29.808
(COLONEL KARIM SCREAMING)

18:31.810 --> 18:33.779
We've drained it.

18:33.846 --> 18:36.448
Doctor! Doctor,
I can't get out!

18:37.649 --> 18:38.817
I can't open it.

18:41.186 --> 18:43.121
No sonic screwdriver.

18:43.188 --> 18:44.923
It's inside the Tardis.

18:45.123 --> 18:47.192
And we can't get in,
'cause guess what?

18:47.259 --> 18:49.628
We stopped ourselves
getting the key.

18:49.695 --> 18:51.296
Oh, that was clever.

18:51.363 --> 18:55.501
I just want to say,
I'm so glad I saw you again.

18:55.567 --> 18:57.469
I waited all this time.

18:57.536 --> 19:01.707
And it was worth it.
Every second.

19:01.773 --> 19:06.311
Funny thing is, though,
your funeral turns out to be
ours instead.

19:06.378 --> 19:07.946
My funeral?

19:08.013 --> 19:10.315
Doctor, all of you,
look after Luke
for me, please!

19:10.382 --> 19:12.084
No, no, no, no.
But listen. My funeral.

It's my funeral!

23:50.829 --> 23:51.897
Easier said than done.

23:52.831 --> 23:53.832
JO: Bye, everyone.

23:54.666 --> 23:56.134
Oh, Sarah Jane.

24:00.539 --> 24:02.474
-Find yourself a fellow.
-Oh!

24:02.541 --> 24:04.442
(JO LAUGHS)

24:04.509 --> 24:07.546
Hang on, wait a minute, guys.
Where did I leave my glasses?

24:07.612 --> 24:09.347
What? Oh...

24:09.414 --> 24:10.749
(ALL LAUGHING)

24:10.816 --> 24:13.285
Head, naturally. Bye.

24:13.351 --> 24:16.788
-See you later.
-See you, guys.

24:16.855 --> 24:20.625
JO: Wait a minute.
Hold on, Mr Taxi. I've got
the directions in Norwegian.

24:20.692 --> 24:22.828
Do you think there's
lots of Jo Grants out there?

24:22.894 --> 24:25.564
You know, like,
the Doctor's old companions?

24:25.630 --> 24:27.465
I do a little search
sometimes.

24:27.532 --> 24:28.733
What did you Google? Tardis?

24:28.800 --> 24:31.870
Hey, it works.
Well, no, I can't be sure,

24:31.937 --> 24:35.073
but there's a woman called
Tegan, in Australia,

24:35.140 --> 24:36.875
fighting for
aboriginal rights.

24:36.942 --> 24:40.779
There's Ben and Polly,
in India,
running an orphanage there.

24:40.846 --> 24:44.749
And there is Harry.
Oh, I loved Harry.
He was a doctor.

24:44.816 --> 24:48.253
He did such good work
with vaccines,
he saved thousands of lives.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.522
Oh, and there's
a Dorothy something,

24:50.589 --> 24:52.657
she runs that company,
A Charitable Earth.

24:52.724 --> 24:54.626
She's raised billions.

24:54.693 --> 24:56.461
And this couple in Cambridge,

24:56.528 --> 24:59.664
both professors,
Ian and Barbara Chesterton.

24:59.731 --> 25:03.602
Rumour has it,
they've never aged,
not since the '60s.

25:03.668 --> 25:04.669
(ENGINE STARTS)

25:04.736 --> 25:06.705
I wonder. (LAUGHS)

25:07.739 --> 25:09.441
That will be us, one day.

25:09.507 --> 25:12.310
Still out there, fighting.

25:12.377 --> 25:15.680
Echoes of the Doctor,
all over the world.

25:15.747 --> 25:17.716
With friends like us,

25:17.782 --> 25:19.551
he's never going to die,
is he?

25:29.027 --> 25:30.662
Hello? Hello?

25:30.729 --> 25:31.863
<i>What's happened?</i>

25:31.930 --> 25:33.698
-Where's Sarah Jane?
-Where's everybody?

25:33.765 --> 25:35.867
-CLYDE: It's the whole world.
-Everybody's gone!

25:35.934 --> 25:37.402
CLYDE: <i>What about Mr Smith?</i>

25:37.469 --> 25:39.304
He's gone blank, like he's
not even in there any more!

25:39.371 --> 25:42.040
What if it's just
the two of us left in
the whole wide world?

25:42.107 --> 25:43.141
(CLATTERING)

25:43.208 --> 25:44.109
RANI: <i>There!</i>

25:45.644 --> 25:47.145
What is that?
It's on every screen.
