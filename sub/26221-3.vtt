like some sort of late bloomer.

09:22.837 --> 09:24.405

09:24.439 --> 09:25.806

09:25.840 --> 09:28.676

that your mother's being nice to you?

10:27.769 --> 10:28.969

17:15.519 --> 17:17.553
Oh, Dr. Walker, thank God.

17:17.588 --> 17:20.256
My daughter and her husband are sick
because she won't cook.

17:20.290 --> 17:22.258
- Can you help?
- I'd be happy to help.

17:22.291 --> 17:23.559
When did the pain start?

17:23.594 --> 17:26.162
Four days ago.

17:26.195 --> 17:28.330
[coughs]

17:28.989 --> 17:30.888
Ah.

17:30.934 --> 17:33.167
This might not be food poisoning.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.470
I suggest we head to the ER.

17:35.504 --> 17:37.839
Mommy, are you dying?

17:37.873 --> 17:39.007
We'll be orphans.

17:39.041 --> 17:41.409
They're gonna split us up.

17:41.443 --> 17:43.311
<i>And it's gone too far.</i>

17:43.345 --> 17:44.312
Okay, okay, stop it.

17:44.346 --> 17:45.446
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

17:45.481 --> 17:46.915
Okay, I can't do this anymore.

17:46.949 --> 17:49.150
I'm not dying. I'm fine.

17:49.184 --> 17:51.419
I'm a liar, okay?

17:52.275 --> 17:54.255
Louie's not on the honor roll.

17:57.493 --> 17:59.827
But I'm sure you had a
good reason for doing it,

17:59.862 --> 18:01.963
so let's just go to dinner.

18:01.997 --> 18:03.264

[gasps] We made it.

18:11.647 --> 18:13.141
Is this really happening?

18:13.175 --> 18:14.509
I love you guys.

18:14.543 --> 18:17.178
Ah, no, no touching.

18:18.247 --> 18:19.847
What?

18:19.882 --> 18:22.016
Uh...

18:22.051 --> 18:24.452
That's the waterfall?

Oh, she's a smoker?

18:30.926 --> 18:32.126

This is some serious bitch-ass-ness.

18:46.508 --> 18:48.876
Never meet your heroes, man.

18:48.911 --> 18:51.312
Oh, God, we've had a ball pop out.

18:51.347 --> 18:52.814
We have confirmation on testicle.

18:52.848 --> 18:54.349
Get back in the elevator. Come on, go!

18:54.383 --> 18:57.018
- Yeah, yeah. Go, go.
- Come on!

18:57.052 --> 18:59.420
You faked an honor roll sticker?

18:59.455 --> 19:01.856
I get a new phone now, right?

19:01.890 --> 19:03.157
Yeah, probably.

19:03.192 --> 19:05.326
Look, honey, I am so sorry.

19:05.361 --> 19:06.995
All your dad and I want

19:07.029 --> 19:09.831
is for you to feel better
about yourself, okay?

19:09.865 --> 19:12.500
And maybe get ready a little
faster in the morning.

19:12.534 --> 19:13.601
Can you forgive us?

19:13.635 --> 19:16.237
Yeah, actually, I'm relieved.

19:16.271 --> 19:18.339
I couldn't figure out how
I got on the honor roll.

19:18.374 --> 19:20.274
I do not try.

19:21.290 --> 19:22.877
Buddy, okay, I'll tell you what.

19:22.911 --> 19:24.178
We'll lie a little less,

19:24.213 --> 19:26.347
and you try a little more, okay?

19:26.382 --> 19:28.383
All right, everybody happy?

19:28.417 --> 19:29.417
Everybody's happy.

19:29.451 --> 19:31.052
- Buca di Beppo's!
- Yes!

19:31.086 --> 19:32.353
No Buca di Beppo.

19:32.388 --> 19:35.023
You made me a glamorous fool.

19:35.057 --> 19:37.892
So where's my apology?

19:37.926 --> 19:40.228
Fine, Mom, I'm sorry.

19:40.262 --> 19:43.064
I'm sorry you don't get the
perfect Instagram daughter.

19:43.098 --> 19:44.132
You get me.

19:44.166 --> 19:45.600
Okay, I'm always late.

19:45.634 --> 19:47.201
I currently have a dirty diaper in my purse.

19:47.236 --> 19:48.636
I haven't done my laundry in two weeks,

19:48.670 --> 19:50.471
so I'm wearing a leotard as underwear,

19:50.506 --> 19:53.474
and I was willing to spin
a web of sticky little lies

19:53.509 --> 19:56.577
just to have my mom shove
love cake in my mouth.

19:56.612 --> 19:58.479
Wow, that's pathetic.

19:58.514 --> 19:59.881

- Excuse me.

19:59.915 --> 20:01.149
No, no.

Nobody talks to my wife like that

20:03.652 --> 20:05.119
And I've earned it.

20:05.154 --> 20:06.988
This is a wonderful mother.

20:07.022 --> 20:10.291
No, she doesn't prance around in a bikini
like Mrs. Dr. Walker, but she could,

20:10.325 --> 20:12.093
and it would be hot.

20:12.127 --> 20:14.228
Lately, she's doing a lot of
the one-piece thing, okay,

20:14.263 --> 20:16.297
but I really miss those bikinis, man.

20:16.331 --> 20:18.232
- You do?
- Yes.

20:18.267 --> 20:20.668
Baby, I can still do a bikini.

20:20.702 --> 20:22.316
- Yeah?
- Yeah, just give me a little heads up.

20:22.372 --> 20:24.042
Yeah, well, consider this your heads up.

20:24.140 --> 20:26.474
You know, as a doctor,
I've seen some pretty sick people

Hey, Louie, I hope you know

Here, have some cake.

Mmm.

Thanks, Mom.

picture off of Instagram.
