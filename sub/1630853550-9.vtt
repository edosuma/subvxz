WEBVTT

00:03.003 --> 00:04.569
Previously on
Roswell, New Mexico...This should restore your powers.

00:04.613 --> 00:06.876
Max doesn't want the cure.
He's made his choice.

00:06.919 --> 00:08.443
What happened to the mist?Might've inhaled a bit.

00:08.486 --> 00:10.140
It's opened my mind up
to infinite possibilities,

00:10.184 --> 00:11.837
including one that is
so close to my heart.

00:11.881 --> 00:13.839
LIZ: She's dead.She doesn't have to be.

00:13.883 --> 00:17.321
That mist will not
regenerate human cells.

00:17.365 --> 00:18.714
You have created the compound

00:18.757 --> 00:20.455
that boosts brain power
beyond limit.

00:20.498 --> 00:23.327
Imagine if the brilliant
Liz Ortecho

00:23.371 --> 00:25.677
tried just a little.No, Shivani, don't do it.

00:26.983 --> 00:28.158
[gasps]

00:32.989 --> 00:34.643
She's barely breathing. Are you
sure you know what you're doing?

00:34.686 --> 00:36.036
No, I got no idea

00:36.079 --> 00:37.428
but I've got the alien doc
in my ear.

00:37.472 --> 00:38.690
Grab the heart rate monitor.

00:38.734 --> 00:40.736
MARIA:
Do we need one for Shivani, too?

00:40.779 --> 00:42.172
No, they kept her at Senovative.
She's not as bad.

00:42.216 --> 00:43.913
Liz must've taken
the brunt of that mist.

00:43.956 --> 00:46.176
Valenti, you got any idea
what a-a gallon

00:46.220 --> 00:47.525
of performance-enhancing alien
solution could do to a human?

00:47.569 --> 00:48.831
When is he supposed to get here?

00:48.874 --> 00:50.180
Uh, it's gonna be
a little while.

00:50.224 --> 00:51.616
Kyle's in Careyes
tracking Allie Meyers.

00:51.660 --> 00:53.096
Sorry, he's in Mexico?

00:53.140 --> 00:54.793
Yeah, it's a long story.
Did you call your dad?

00:54.837 --> 00:56.099
No. About alien drugs?
Absolutely not.

00:56.143 --> 00:57.753
Nobody wants him
here screaming over

00:57.796 --> 00:59.450
justice for his Elizabeth.

00:59.494 --> 01:00.930
Her temp is 101.3.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.019
Heart rate's dropping.Is there anyone else

01:03.063 --> 01:04.542
at Deep Sky that can help us?

01:04.586 --> 01:05.674
He said there's no one
who knows more

01:05.717 --> 01:07.023
about alien science than me.

01:07.632 --> 01:08.894
Which is comforting
to no one, so...

01:08.938 --> 01:10.461
We need to find the naloxone.

01:10.505 --> 01:11.767
Valenti said it'll block
the drug, reverse its effects.

01:11.810 --> 01:13.725
That's for opioids,

01:13.769 --> 01:15.727
not alien narcotics.
How can he be so sure

01:15.771 --> 01:17.338
that that's gonna work?He can't.

01:24.823 --> 01:26.956
[beeping]Hey, it's going up,
that's good.

01:26.999 --> 01:28.392
MICHAEL:
Valenti said it needs to be

01:28.436 --> 01:30.046
closer to 60.Okay, this is an alien problem.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.222
Maybe we need to attack it
in an alien way.

01:32.266 --> 01:35.138
If we jump into her mind...But she's comatose and
you are basically human.

01:35.182 --> 01:37.009
We have no idea what
this is dong to her brain.Right.

01:37.053 --> 01:38.707
Exactly, which is why we need
to talk to a scientist.

01:38.750 --> 01:40.056
No offense, Michael.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.406
Okay, well, I will go in,
then, alone.

01:42.450 --> 01:44.452
No. If anyone can reach her
in there, it's me.

01:44.495 --> 01:45.757
We need answers.

01:45.801 --> 01:48.195
[sighs] Okay, fine. You coming?

01:48.238 --> 01:50.153
No, I think you got it.
I got to make a phone call.

01:53.765 --> 01:55.376
Thank you.

01:55.419 --> 01:57.813
You ready for this?

02:08.998 --> 02:10.391
I don't get it.

02:10.434 --> 02:12.610
When you were in trouble,
your mind was crumbling.

02:12.654 --> 02:14.046
Maria's was haunted.

02:14.090 --> 02:16.005
Why is Liz's so normal?

02:18.312 --> 02:20.357
I don't think, uh,

02:20.401 --> 02:23.143
horses are normal.

02:26.102 --> 02:27.973
And neither are they.

02:28.017 --> 02:29.801
ISOBEL:
Cowboy bodyguards.

02:29.845 --> 02:31.716
Can't say that
she doesn't have a type.

02:31.760 --> 02:34.197
Hey, uh, any of you buckaroos

02:34.241 --> 02:37.679
know where we can
find Liz Ortecho?

02:43.859 --> 02:45.687
[grunts]Max!

02:47.167 --> 02:49.647
Don't do this! I'm here to help!

02:49.691 --> 02:51.127
[grunting]

02:51.780 --> 02:53.173
Did you find Liz?No, it's like

02:53.216 --> 02:54.652
a "Cowboy on Elm Street"
in there.

02:54.696 --> 02:56.219
I got shot.MICHAEL: What about Max?

02:56.263 --> 02:58.178
Why isn't he waking up?Oh, God.

02:58.221 --> 03:00.702
Max got taken.

03:00.745 --> 03:02.094
Is he trapped inside?

03:02.965 --> 03:04.706
I think they both are.

03:07.839 --> 03:10.407
â™ª

03:12.757 --> 03:14.019
[gasps]

03:18.110 --> 03:20.200
Okay, this is strange.

03:20.243 --> 03:21.853
Um...

03:24.378 --> 03:27.381
Am I dreaming?

03:27.424 --> 03:30.427
Or is this a mindscape?

03:32.908 --> 03:34.779
CROWD: Surprise!

03:35.389 --> 03:37.260
Ten years, Sheriff.

03:37.304 --> 03:38.740
What a feat.

03:41.873 --> 03:43.571
Sheriff of my own mind.

03:43.614 --> 03:45.834
Cute. I'm sure Freud would be
interested in that one.

03:45.877 --> 03:48.750
Uh, where's Max?

03:48.793 --> 03:50.055
On his book tour?

03:50.099 --> 03:52.884
Oh. He finally wrote his novel.

03:52.928 --> 03:56.323
His third novel.
You o-okay, Sheriff?

03:56.366 --> 03:59.151
Yeah. Yeah, I will be,
as soon as I wake up.

03:59.761 --> 04:02.024
[takes deep breath]

04:05.723 --> 04:08.073
But if I can't wake up, then...

04:09.727 --> 04:11.381
This is definitely a mindscape.

04:11.425 --> 04:13.253
Liz, it's Max.

04:13.949 --> 04:15.167
He's been kidnapped.

04:16.821 --> 04:20.477
Max kidnapped,
Isobel Evans murdered.

04:20.521 --> 04:23.437
It's unthinkable.

04:23.480 --> 04:26.135
Why here? Why Max?

04:26.918 --> 04:28.180
Why you?

04:28.224 --> 04:29.747
Uh, I don't know
about the first two,

04:29.791 --> 04:32.576
but seeking justice will never
be out of my blood.

04:32.620 --> 04:34.404
I may be retired,

04:34.448 --> 04:36.624
but Deputy Machete's
still got skills.

04:36.667 --> 04:38.756
Deputy Mache... No, mm-mmm.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.105
You can stay put.

04:42.499 --> 04:44.066
[two thumps]

04:44.109 --> 04:45.372
Little sisters don't get
to boss their family around.

04:45.415 --> 04:47.330
Shouldn't you be
Frida Kahlo in this?

04:47.374 --> 04:49.114
This is your man we're
talking about, okay?

04:49.158 --> 04:50.594
I already spoke
to the bartender,

04:50.638 --> 04:52.509
and she said she only heard
one shot fired.

04:52.553 --> 04:54.119
So the real question:

04:54.163 --> 04:57.427
how does a gunslinger
as fast as Isobel Evans get got?

04:57.471 --> 04:59.603
'Cause Isobel Evans
isn't a gunslinger.

04:59.647 --> 05:01.866
She's an alien swordswoman.

05:03.825 --> 05:05.566
Ugh! Think, Liz.
Think, think, think.

05:05.609 --> 05:08.308
[sighs] Okay. I was, uh...

05:08.351 --> 05:11.528
I was arguing with Shivani.
She broke the canister.

05:13.225 --> 05:15.097
I inhaled the mist.

05:15.880 --> 05:19.362
That is why I'm trapped
in my own Tombstonemindscape.

05:19.406 --> 05:21.451
Every time that we are trapped
in one of these rodeos

05:21.495 --> 05:23.235
it's because the person
whose head we're in

05:23.279 --> 05:24.889
has something to sort out.

05:24.933 --> 05:26.326
Liz, you're traumatized.No. No, no, no.

05:26.369 --> 05:28.284
I think
I'm thinking very clearly.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.634
What I need to do
is follow the path

05:30.678 --> 05:32.332
and figure out why I'm here.

05:32.375 --> 05:34.464
Max is missing.
Take a minute, mija.

05:34.508 --> 05:36.510
I can't. In order to wake up,
I have to solve the riddle.

05:36.553 --> 05:38.990
Okay? And the first step
is to find it.

05:39.034 --> 05:40.644
Liz, mira.

05:40.688 --> 05:42.777
That's the direction of...

05:42.820 --> 05:43.908
My house.

05:43.952 --> 05:45.170
Ask and you shall receive.

05:45.214 --> 05:47.564
Okay, Machete, stay here.
Vamos.

05:52.874 --> 05:54.702
[panting]

05:54.745 --> 05:58.053
"Surrender Sheriff,
or the real Max dies."

05:58.096 --> 06:00.360
What does he mean "real Max"?

06:00.403 --> 06:02.231
It means Max came in after me.

06:02.274 --> 06:03.928
But if he dies in here
he's not gonna die out there.

06:03.972 --> 06:05.365
He'll just get ejected.

06:07.410 --> 06:08.498
Unless...

06:08.542 --> 06:10.152
I'm scared to ask.

06:10.195 --> 06:12.372
Sweaty palms.

06:13.895 --> 06:15.375
Slowed pulse.

06:16.201 --> 06:19.553
In the real world, I'm dying.

06:25.472 --> 06:27.038
I can't get back in.

06:27.082 --> 06:28.997
It's like there's
a barrier.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.086
Shivani's docs said the drugs
turned her into Jimmy Neutron.

06:31.129 --> 06:32.348
Before she passed out,

06:32.392 --> 06:33.523
she was writing formulas
on the board

06:33.567 --> 06:34.872
in subjects
she never even studied.

06:34.916 --> 06:36.221
If the alien proteins
in that compound

06:36.265 --> 06:37.527
grafted onto Liz's cells,

06:37.571 --> 06:39.268
maybe it's giving her mind
the ability to...

06:39.311 --> 06:41.879
bind Max inside.

06:41.923 --> 06:44.534
In other words, Max is struck
in there until Liz wakes up?

06:44.578 --> 06:47.407
Or until Liz dies.

06:47.450 --> 06:49.017
In which case, Max dies too.

06:52.281 --> 06:53.500
She's got a rash on her chest.

06:53.543 --> 06:55.545
Oh, God.Her pulse is declining.

06:55.589 --> 06:57.547
What do we do now, Guerin?How would I know?

06:57.591 --> 06:58.940
I engineer alien tech,

06:58.983 --> 06:59.897
not bodies.

06:59.941 --> 07:01.203
Clearly, Kyle
trusted you.

07:01.246 --> 07:02.422
Because he had no choice.

07:02.465 --> 07:03.553
Maybe it's time
to call a doctor,

07:03.597 --> 07:04.685
because right now
it might as well

07:04.728 --> 07:05.773
be Sanders working on them.

07:05.816 --> 07:07.427
I already called one.

07:08.384 --> 07:09.516
ISOBLE:
Heath?

07:09.559 --> 07:10.604
You're back in Roswell?

07:10.647 --> 07:12.127
For the time being, yeah.

07:12.170 --> 07:14.303
It's good to see you
not dangling on a window,

07:14.346 --> 07:15.913
but, last I checked, man,

07:15.957 --> 07:17.828
you're-you're a scientist.
You're not a physician.

07:17.872 --> 07:19.569
Actually, I am back
in med school,

07:19.613 --> 07:20.918
but thanks for the warm welcome.

07:20.962 --> 07:22.267
ROSA:
The only people
who can beat Heath

07:22.311 --> 07:23.747
in an alien science fair are

07:23.791 --> 07:25.140
either in Mexico or...

07:25.967 --> 07:27.751
So, what's your prognosis?

07:27.795 --> 07:29.405
Well, I can't be sure
until I run some more tests,

07:29.449 --> 07:31.059
but...

07:31.102 --> 07:35.019
cold hands, fever, rash--
it could be autoimmune.

07:35.063 --> 07:36.934
Meaning?Meaning that the mist

07:36.978 --> 07:38.806
could be causing her
body to attack itself.

07:38.849 --> 07:40.155
I'm gonna give her
some steroids.

07:40.198 --> 07:41.635
It should suppress
the immune response.

07:41.678 --> 07:43.811
Well, at least,
in normal circumstances.

07:43.854 --> 07:45.900
But nothing is normal
in Roswell.

07:48.424 --> 07:50.121
[monitor beeping]

07:50.165 --> 07:52.297
Hey, what's happening?
Is it-is it working?HEATH: Yes, but

07:52.341 --> 07:53.603
not like I'd hoped.

07:53.647 --> 07:55.692
I need to mix up
something stronger.

07:55.736 --> 07:58.173
Alien toxins
call for alien cures--

07:58.216 --> 07:59.435
shocking.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.524
Do you need help?No.

08:01.568 --> 08:03.439
No, uh, you should
stay here

08:03.483 --> 08:04.875
with them.And do what?

08:04.919 --> 08:07.182
Want me to read them
a bedtime story?

08:08.488 --> 08:10.881
Actually, that's not a bad idea.

08:10.925 --> 08:13.014
I-I mean, from what you've
all said about mindscapes,

08:13.057 --> 08:14.624
they sound like
a convergence of

08:14.668 --> 08:15.973
our conscious and
subconscious minds.

08:16.017 --> 08:17.627
You throw in
a little trauma

08:17.671 --> 08:18.889
and you've basically got a coma.

08:18.933 --> 08:20.543
A-And coma patients react well

08:20.587 --> 08:21.892
to familiar voices around them.

08:22.719 --> 08:24.155
Here, I'll show you to the lab.

08:28.943 --> 08:31.162
â™ª Make me an angel

08:31.206 --> 08:35.297
â™ª That flies from Montgomery

08:35.340 --> 08:39.344
â™ª And make me a poster

08:39.388 --> 08:41.303
â™ª Of an old rodeo...

08:41.346 --> 08:42.696
Well, this is it.

08:42.739 --> 08:44.349
â™ª Oh, just give me The Den of Outlaws

08:44.393 --> 08:46.308
â™ª One thing which you have raided many times

08:46.351 --> 08:48.005
â™ª I can hold on to... and don't seem to remember.

08:48.049 --> 08:50.530
Okay, if my mind conjured up
a villain to kidnap Max,

08:50.573 --> 08:52.749
and this is where villains go,
then...

08:52.793 --> 08:55.665
someone here probably
knows who took him.

08:55.709 --> 08:57.058
â™ª Way...

08:57.101 --> 08:58.581
I know this song.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.278
â™ª To Maria sings it

09:00.322 --> 09:01.845
when something's wrong.â™ª Go.

09:01.889 --> 09:03.151
Yeah, I mean,
there's plenty wrong.

09:03.194 --> 09:04.935
Max is missing,
and you think

09:04.979 --> 09:06.284
that we're living in
a parallel universe.[applause]

09:06.328 --> 09:08.504
Yes, one where Max's fate
is tied to mine.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.593
Look, we got to find him and
get out of here before I die.

09:10.637 --> 09:12.552
You guys are
way too codependent.

09:12.595 --> 09:14.075
Hey.

09:15.119 --> 09:16.599
Maria.

09:16.643 --> 09:18.209
I got to get up there.

09:18.253 --> 09:19.994
I'm looking for Max.He's been taken.

09:22.083 --> 09:23.780
Got some real hot pistols
up there.

09:23.824 --> 09:25.260
Keep your wits about you.

09:25.303 --> 09:26.653
Here you go,ma'am.

09:26.696 --> 09:28.742
â™ª All I can say is that

09:28.785 --> 09:30.613
â™ª My life is pretty plain...

09:30.657 --> 09:32.833
High stakes hold 'em,

09:32.876 --> 09:34.617
starring Michael
as Doc Holliday.

09:34.661 --> 09:35.966
Go figure.

09:36.010 --> 09:38.316
And there's
his partner in crime.

09:39.448 --> 09:41.711
We'll be over there
if you need anything.

09:41.755 --> 09:44.279
â™ª Just pour some tea for two

09:44.322 --> 09:46.411
â™ª And speak my point
of view... â™ª

09:46.455 --> 09:48.109
Who's got the hot hand?

09:48.152 --> 09:51.634
That guy's a yellow-bellied
something or other.

09:51.678 --> 09:53.723
Took all my tequila money.

09:53.767 --> 09:56.639
HEATH:
This one's on the house.

09:58.075 --> 09:59.468
Heath.

09:59.511 --> 10:00.904
To calm the nerves.

10:00.948 --> 10:02.471
Slinging drinks
instead of serums, huh?

10:02.514 --> 10:03.733
Good for you.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.433
My God, that is bitter.

10:08.477 --> 10:10.610
It tastes like medicine.

10:11.654 --> 10:13.787
I'm overdosing.

10:13.830 --> 10:16.137
Always happy to help.

10:17.442 --> 10:18.748
Sanders is right, though.

10:18.792 --> 10:20.663
That guy's robbing
the locals blind.

10:20.707 --> 10:22.883
You going after him?

10:22.926 --> 10:25.059
Looks that way.

10:31.021 --> 10:34.198
Is there a problem, Sheriff?

10:35.330 --> 10:36.374
You.

10:37.506 --> 10:38.638
Where's Max?

10:40.335 --> 10:42.816
If you want anything from me,
you have to win it in the game.

10:42.859 --> 10:45.296
I have to play poker
to learn a lesson.

10:45.340 --> 10:46.558
How very literal.

10:46.602 --> 10:48.517
How about we take a shortcut

10:48.560 --> 10:50.867
and Michael plays for me?

10:50.911 --> 10:55.002
And if he wins this hand,
then you tell me where Max is.

10:56.438 --> 11:00.094
I win, I get that ring
in your pocket.

11:08.842 --> 11:11.279
How did you know
I had that in there?

11:12.062 --> 11:14.412
Little birdie told me.

11:14.456 --> 11:16.893
Said that's what
it's all about for you.

11:16.937 --> 11:19.156
What does that even mean?

11:19.200 --> 11:20.505
We playing?

11:20.549 --> 11:22.116
Or you too chicken?

11:22.159 --> 11:23.987
I am the villain, after all.

11:35.782 --> 11:37.871
I'm all in.

11:43.528 --> 11:45.443
He's all in.

11:51.058 --> 11:52.407
DEALER:
Jacks have it.

11:54.409 --> 11:56.193
I guess you win.

11:56.237 --> 11:57.717
Funny thing,

11:57.760 --> 12:01.068
Max isn't mine to give.

12:02.504 --> 12:03.897
Liz!

12:04.724 --> 12:06.334
He's getting away.

12:06.377 --> 12:07.857
Go, we'll get Kyle.

12:10.425 --> 12:13.384
Rosa. Maria. Kyle!

12:14.821 --> 12:15.909
MARIA:
Liz!

12:15.952 --> 12:19.390
I thought you were
bringing Kyle.

12:19.434 --> 12:20.652
This is Kyle.

12:22.132 --> 12:23.003
I wish I had a second
to Freud this up, but I don't.

12:23.046 --> 12:24.918
Okay. [grunts]

12:24.961 --> 12:26.789
Why couldn't you be a car?
Come on.

12:26.833 --> 12:28.965
â™ª

12:36.320 --> 12:37.931
Come on, Kyle!

12:48.637 --> 12:50.465
Hyah.

12:59.648 --> 13:01.258
Where is he? Where's Max?

13:01.302 --> 13:02.912
He's safe.

13:03.521 --> 13:05.828
But he'll die if you don't
make the right choice.

13:05.872 --> 13:08.788
Which is?Surrender.

13:11.138 --> 13:13.096
Don't look so surprised.

13:13.140 --> 13:15.142
Aren't we always
our own worst enemy,

13:15.185 --> 13:17.492
Elizabeth?You created this.

13:18.667 --> 13:19.799
Why?

13:19.842 --> 13:20.930
You're a smart girl.

13:20.974 --> 13:22.540
Merlot and Morissette it.

13:23.759 --> 13:25.369
Hyah.

13:34.248 --> 13:36.293
Hey. How's it going?Well,

13:36.337 --> 13:38.339
the drug has latched on
to Liz's nerve receptors.

13:38.382 --> 13:41.211
Somehow it's managed to trick
her immune system into thinking

13:41.255 --> 13:43.518
that her own nerves
are actually foreign bodies.

13:43.561 --> 13:45.085
Which would be an easy fix,

13:45.128 --> 13:46.651
if I had a way
to camouflage alien proteins

13:46.695 --> 13:48.218
inside human biology.

13:48.262 --> 13:50.699
Unfortunately, NYU hasn't
quite gotten there yet.

13:51.526 --> 13:52.875
Thank you for not giving up.

13:52.919 --> 13:54.181
Yeah.

13:54.224 --> 13:55.530
So, uh...

13:55.573 --> 13:58.533
how long has Dallas
been missing?

13:58.576 --> 14:00.187
No more than a day.

14:00.230 --> 14:01.666
Listen, I'm sorry

14:01.710 --> 14:03.755
that I didn't
tell you over the phone.

14:03.799 --> 14:05.583
I just thought that
you should hear it in person.

14:05.627 --> 14:06.933
You know, I almost didn't
go back to med school.

14:06.976 --> 14:08.891
I didn't want
to leave Dallas.

14:08.935 --> 14:11.328
But I convinced myself
that he would be okay

14:11.372 --> 14:13.853
because he has
his little threesome.

14:13.896 --> 14:15.855
Triad.He had Isobel and Michael
to help him

14:15.898 --> 14:17.552
understand who he is.
He had Liz and Kyle

14:17.595 --> 14:18.988
in case he got sick again.

14:19.032 --> 14:22.035
I mean, what could possibly
go wrong, right?

14:22.078 --> 14:24.298
Look, I-I'm sorry.

14:24.341 --> 14:26.691
I-I distracted you.

14:27.388 --> 14:29.564
[sighs]

14:30.391 --> 14:31.827
It's not your fault.

14:35.396 --> 14:37.920
[clears throat]
Hey.

14:37.964 --> 14:39.487
I was getting
a little antsy,

14:39.530 --> 14:42.185
thought maybe you needed
some caffeine,

14:42.229 --> 14:44.361
but I can see you guys are busy,

14:44.405 --> 14:45.754
so...

14:47.538 --> 14:49.714
I'm gonna go.

14:50.541 --> 14:51.499
Hey.

14:51.542 --> 14:53.675
Look, Bikini Kill.

14:53.718 --> 14:56.460
Liz, she's got her boyfriend.

14:56.504 --> 14:58.158
You've got your boyfriend.

14:58.201 --> 14:59.202
[scoffs]

14:59.246 --> 15:00.464
I'm-a go get my boyfriend.

15:00.508 --> 15:02.118
Heath is not
my boyfriend, okay?

15:02.162 --> 15:03.903
People hug when they're sad.

15:03.946 --> 15:05.426
You stepped outside
to make a call

15:05.469 --> 15:07.036
and 30 minutes later,
Heath swooped in.

15:07.080 --> 15:09.386
So either Dr. Feelgood
came to town with you, or...

15:09.430 --> 15:11.301
did you developed
beam-me-up powers?

15:11.345 --> 15:12.563
Or Heath came yesterday.

15:12.607 --> 15:14.043
After you told me about Dallas.

15:14.087 --> 15:17.568
Look, he's been
helping me. When I

15:17.612 --> 15:19.919
got to New York,
Parsons was great.

15:19.962 --> 15:21.572
All right? It
was everything

15:21.616 --> 15:23.052
that I needed, but it didn't
take me that long

15:23.096 --> 15:25.402
to figure out that
art is only one part of me,

15:25.446 --> 15:27.448
and there's a whole
huge other part

15:27.491 --> 15:28.840
that, unless I explore it,

15:28.884 --> 15:30.407
I'm never gonna be
who I actually am.

15:30.451 --> 15:32.975
So you called Heath
to help you be a better alien?

15:33.019 --> 15:34.542
He's the only one
who knows alien DNA.

15:34.585 --> 15:35.673
What about your sister?

15:35.717 --> 15:37.240
And your brother?

15:37.284 --> 15:38.720
There's no way that
I'm gonna have them knowing

15:38.763 --> 15:39.764
that I feel lost.

15:39.808 --> 15:41.070
You know how sick I am

15:41.114 --> 15:43.290
of feeling like I am
the needy sister.

15:43.333 --> 15:44.900
[sighs]

15:46.162 --> 15:47.772
I get that.

15:47.816 --> 15:49.165
I just really made a huge
mistake by cutting myself off.

15:49.209 --> 15:51.167
I think that
if I had stayed connected

15:51.211 --> 15:53.387
to the things that are important
I could've seen this coming.

15:53.430 --> 15:54.692
Max is with Liz
every single day,

15:54.736 --> 15:56.825
and even he didn't
see it coming.

15:56.868 --> 15:58.740
I know, I just
feel helpless.

16:00.524 --> 16:02.744
But I'm guessing
that you do, too.

16:02.787 --> 16:04.354
It was bad enough
when Alex went missing,

16:04.398 --> 16:06.443
but now that I know
he's trapped

16:06.487 --> 16:09.272
in an alien-engineered
sinkhole, yeah--

16:09.316 --> 16:10.970
sitting here
doing nothing sucks.

16:11.883 --> 16:13.668
Max jumped into a mindscape
after the woman he loves.

16:13.711 --> 16:16.801
The least I can do is jump into
a sinkhole to save my soulmate.

16:16.845 --> 16:18.325
Do you remember what
happened the last time

16:18.368 --> 16:19.891
that you abandoned all logic?

16:19.935 --> 16:22.764
You threw me in a car
and then blew me up.

16:22.807 --> 16:25.158
Don't make
the same mistake twice.

16:25.201 --> 16:26.376
Listen, I know

16:26.420 --> 16:27.856
that you want to help,

16:27.899 --> 16:29.510
but cannonballing
into a sinkhole after Alex

16:29.553 --> 16:30.685
isn't gonna help anybody.

16:30.728 --> 16:31.991
Right now,

16:32.034 --> 16:33.644
Heath is in there,
really struggling

16:33.688 --> 16:35.255
to figure out
how to camouflage alien protein,

16:35.298 --> 16:37.300
and Kyle said that
you're the only one

16:37.344 --> 16:38.780
who can help.

16:39.607 --> 16:41.609
Fine. But I don't know if...

16:42.914 --> 16:44.525
Has he tried Max's blood yet?

16:44.568 --> 16:46.831
Liz said Bonnie's virus
mutes alien DNA.

16:46.875 --> 16:48.355
So if it's still in him,

16:48.398 --> 16:50.748
maybe we could reengineer it
to bolster the steroids.

16:50.792 --> 16:52.663
Okay, why are we still
standing here? Go.

17:02.456 --> 17:04.980
Hi, uh...

17:05.024 --> 17:07.113
my sister said
I used to come here for help,

17:07.156 --> 17:09.724
and I could really
use some right now.

17:09.767 --> 17:11.769
Are you the old Sheriff?

17:11.813 --> 17:13.989
I was your old teacher, but...

17:14.033 --> 17:16.905
I guess the mentor part's
what counts.

17:17.688 --> 17:20.082
[chuckles]

17:20.126 --> 17:21.301
Allie Meyers.

17:22.606 --> 17:24.869
You know this...
this isn't real, right?

17:24.913 --> 17:26.697
Uh-huh.

17:26.741 --> 17:29.091
So, you here
to talk circular mRNA

17:29.135 --> 17:33.182
or why you're stuck in
Once Upon a Time in Roswell?

17:33.226 --> 17:35.097
I want to know
why there are two of me.

17:35.141 --> 17:37.099
You really need to conjure me
to tell you

17:37.143 --> 17:40.189
that in most big choices in life
we're of two minds?

17:41.190 --> 17:42.713
The question is...

17:42.757 --> 17:44.541
what are you weighing out?

17:44.585 --> 17:47.327
Well, before I ended up here,

17:47.370 --> 17:49.068
I-I was thinking about the drug.

17:49.111 --> 17:51.418
And how on one hand
it's dangerous, but...

17:51.461 --> 17:53.985
on the other hand,
it could accomplish so much.

17:54.029 --> 17:56.727
But I had already made
the decision not to take it.

17:56.771 --> 17:59.556
I think your other half
is pissed.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.732
So she took
Shivani's words literally

18:01.776 --> 18:03.082
and trapped me
in a dried-up dairy town?

18:03.125 --> 18:04.735
Only now I'm
the Tin Starcowboy?

18:04.779 --> 18:06.389
She did what you do
in the lab.

18:06.433 --> 18:07.608
Created a scenario

18:07.651 --> 18:09.088
for you to suss out an answer,

18:09.131 --> 18:11.307
trading petri dishes
for six-shooters.

18:11.351 --> 18:12.395
An answer to what question?

18:12.439 --> 18:13.962
I mean,

18:14.005 --> 18:15.964
all I know is that
it has to do with Max dying,

18:16.007 --> 18:18.749
and-and apparently
Abuela'sring?

18:18.793 --> 18:22.405
[chuckles] She's definitely
relishing being in the saddle.

18:22.449 --> 18:24.015
You--

18:24.059 --> 18:25.408
you got to keep
playing the game.

18:25.452 --> 18:26.757
No, God, I'm tired
of the game, Allie.

18:26.801 --> 18:28.759
How do I wake up?Simple.

18:28.803 --> 18:30.413
Follow the path,
figure out what it is

18:30.457 --> 18:31.893
that you don't want to confront.

18:37.855 --> 18:40.554
You know, she-she's just
one part of me, right?

18:40.597 --> 18:41.946
Like a split personality.

18:41.990 --> 18:44.079
So I don't need her to survive.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.560
There are no shortcuts, Liz.

18:46.603 --> 18:48.257
Whatever dark truth
she's carrying,

18:48.301 --> 18:50.216
you're gonna have to face
eventually.

18:50.259 --> 18:51.391
I disagree.

18:52.479 --> 18:53.697
Come on, ride with me.

18:53.741 --> 18:55.438
Sorry, kid.

18:55.482 --> 18:58.224
If you don't want to listen,
you're on your own.

18:59.660 --> 19:01.009
[sighs]

19:03.446 --> 19:05.666
[hoofbeats approaching]

19:14.022 --> 19:16.155
Liz. Oh, thank God.

19:17.808 --> 19:20.289
We're gonna take a walk.

19:20.985 --> 19:22.639
No, Liz,
you-you have to wake up.

19:22.683 --> 19:24.337
That-that drug you took--
it's poison. It's killing you.

19:24.380 --> 19:26.643
Stopping the drug
would be counterproductive.

19:26.687 --> 19:28.036
It isn't killing me.

19:28.079 --> 19:29.690
It's making me stronger.

19:29.733 --> 19:31.779
You took it on purpose.

19:32.954 --> 19:36.218
As much as I'd like
to take credit...

19:36.262 --> 19:37.567
Shivani dosed me.

19:37.611 --> 19:39.482
But it was serendipity.

19:39.526 --> 19:41.136
Like a girl

19:41.180 --> 19:45.009
crossing paths with a sheriff
and his magic hands

19:45.053 --> 19:46.794
on the night
that she was shot.

19:46.837 --> 19:49.840
Accidents are the spark
of evolution.

19:49.884 --> 19:51.886
The other Liz disagrees.

19:54.671 --> 19:56.673
The other Liz? [grunts]

19:56.717 --> 20:00.199
She's been in charge
for far too long.

20:00.242 --> 20:03.027
Been searching for a way
to show her that she's lost,

20:03.071 --> 20:05.029
and then you showed up--
perfect pawn.

20:05.073 --> 20:06.379
Can I get some water?

20:09.251 --> 20:11.514
Looks like your sheriff
finally wised up

20:11.558 --> 20:13.386
and asked for a meeting.

20:14.169 --> 20:16.258
You better hope
she's ready to surrender.

20:25.963 --> 20:28.879
So you're raising
the white flag.

20:29.706 --> 20:31.142
Actually,
I'm ready to wake up.

20:31.186 --> 20:32.622
And you think that's
your choice?

20:32.666 --> 20:33.884
I know it's not.

20:33.928 --> 20:35.538
I need you
to want to wake up, too,

20:35.582 --> 20:38.280
which is why I'm extending
an olive branch.

20:40.848 --> 20:42.284
Let's parley.

20:42.328 --> 20:43.677
Cute, but no.

20:43.720 --> 20:44.982
Well, then I'm afraid
this town ain't big enough

20:45.026 --> 20:46.245
for the both of us.

20:49.813 --> 20:51.902
Now that I have your attention,

20:51.946 --> 20:53.556
I did some thinking.

20:53.600 --> 20:54.688
Hmm.

20:54.731 --> 20:56.255
All you are is a manifestation

20:56.298 --> 20:58.996
of a dark,
fleeting impulse I had

20:59.040 --> 21:00.433
in a moment of weakness.

21:00.476 --> 21:02.217
You were born
out of a schism in my mind

21:02.261 --> 21:03.914
that has been allowed
to grow too deep.

21:03.958 --> 21:06.917
So if I take you out,
rid myself of

21:06.961 --> 21:08.267
that dangerous urge,

21:08.310 --> 21:10.965
there is nothing
anchoring me or Max

21:11.008 --> 21:13.184
to this place.Pull the trigger.

21:13.228 --> 21:15.709
But know that if you do,
Max's death will be on you.

21:15.752 --> 21:16.797
Max won't die.

21:16.840 --> 21:18.755
When I wake up, so will he.

21:18.799 --> 21:20.453
And then what happens next?

21:20.496 --> 21:22.411
Without me,

21:22.455 --> 21:24.631
you'll be too scared
to protect him.

21:24.674 --> 21:26.067
Scared of what, exactly?

21:26.110 --> 21:27.590
The other shoe to drop.

21:27.634 --> 21:29.157
Right now,
you're just

21:29.200 --> 21:30.550
refusing to face it.

21:30.593 --> 21:31.986
I'll figure it out.

21:39.646 --> 21:41.430
How did you do that?

21:41.474 --> 21:43.867
It's a metaphor, Liz.

21:43.911 --> 21:45.565
[high-pitched ringing]

21:45.608 --> 21:48.829
For how strong we'll be
on the other side.

21:49.525 --> 21:50.613
See you at high noon.

21:50.657 --> 21:52.311
[high-pitched ringing]

22:01.537 --> 22:04.279
I need you to find Liz.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.847
And wake up, okay?

22:06.890 --> 22:08.979
'Cause I'm the one
that let you go in there

22:09.023 --> 22:10.633
without a way
to defend yourself.

22:10.677 --> 22:12.156
MARIA:
Hey, how you doing?

22:12.200 --> 22:13.767
Good, yeah. I'm good.

22:13.810 --> 22:17.031
Well, Heath and Michael
are now in the lab,

22:17.074 --> 22:18.641
furiously mixing up an elixir

22:18.685 --> 22:22.079
that-- I quote-- "will shield
Liz's neural receptors,

22:22.123 --> 22:23.690
"buying her some time

22:23.733 --> 22:26.083
so she can kick
this thing's ass."

22:26.127 --> 22:28.999
Liz and Max are in good hands.

22:29.739 --> 22:31.654
ISOBEL:
I knew it was a bad idea

22:31.698 --> 22:34.657
to let him in to Liz's mind.

22:34.701 --> 22:36.006
And now he's trapped there,

22:36.050 --> 22:37.660
and we don't even
have Kyle to help us.

22:37.704 --> 22:39.619
And that's also my fault,
by the way.

22:39.662 --> 22:41.447
How is Kyle your fault?

22:43.100 --> 22:44.450
Oh.

22:44.493 --> 22:45.929
You slept with him.

22:46.930 --> 22:48.192
Yeah.

22:48.236 --> 22:50.020
And it was kind of spectacular.

22:50.891 --> 22:52.153
[chuckles]

22:52.196 --> 22:54.851
Until I, uh, cold-shouldered him
and ran away.

22:54.895 --> 22:56.418
You just got out of
a relationship.

22:56.462 --> 22:58.638
I'm sure he understands.Yeah, no, he does.

22:58.681 --> 23:01.510
Which is why he told me
he would wait for me.

23:01.554 --> 23:03.512
And then I told him
not to bother,

23:03.556 --> 23:06.907
because, um,
I destroy everything I touch.

23:06.950 --> 23:08.909
Like Anatsa.

23:10.737 --> 23:11.912
And Max.

23:11.955 --> 23:13.392
Hey, come on.

23:13.435 --> 23:15.698
Where's all this coming from?

23:15.742 --> 23:18.788
I saw Tezca's memories, Maria.

23:19.963 --> 23:23.053
She wasn't just my teacher.
She was my hero.

23:23.097 --> 23:24.925
And when Jones
came for her,

23:24.968 --> 23:26.317
I did nothing.

23:26.361 --> 23:28.407
I hid, like a coward.

23:28.450 --> 23:29.712
You were seven years old.

23:29.756 --> 23:31.192
I could've at least
done something.

23:31.235 --> 23:32.846
If you had confronted Jones
back then,

23:32.889 --> 23:34.543
he would've taken you, too.

23:34.587 --> 23:36.545
And we wouldn't be at war
with just Tezca.

23:36.589 --> 23:38.242
It'd be you as well.

23:38.286 --> 23:40.767
She saved me.

23:41.768 --> 23:43.639
And it destroyed her.Hey.

23:43.683 --> 23:45.554
You can save her right back.

23:45.598 --> 23:47.904
This isn't about
Kyle or Anatsa.

23:47.948 --> 23:50.603
This is about this moment,
right now.

23:52.343 --> 23:53.693
Stop trying to convince yourself

23:53.736 --> 23:55.782
that you're less
than what you are, Isobel.

23:56.609 --> 23:58.567
You're a warrior.

23:58.611 --> 24:00.874
You have a dojo to prove it.

24:00.917 --> 24:02.963
[chuckles]

24:08.490 --> 24:10.579
So, you're what, Liz's id?

24:10.623 --> 24:12.842
And the sheriff is
her-her moral conscience?

24:12.886 --> 24:14.931
No wonder she would
never surrender to you.

24:14.975 --> 24:17.586
She's prepared to let you die.
She's stupider than I thought.

24:17.630 --> 24:19.196
[chuckles]
Or you've got it backwards

24:19.240 --> 24:20.589
and you're the stupid one.

24:20.633 --> 24:21.764
There's a reason
she's the sheriff

24:21.808 --> 24:23.200
and you're just a villain.

24:23.244 --> 24:25.594
Yeah, there is. You.

24:25.638 --> 24:27.901
[chuckles softly]

24:27.944 --> 24:29.424
You know, she's repressed you

24:29.468 --> 24:31.644
because you're everything
she hates.

24:31.687 --> 24:33.733
You're selfish,
impatient, callous.

24:33.776 --> 24:34.864
And stronger.

24:34.908 --> 24:36.605
She's given up
on what we want.

24:36.649 --> 24:39.390
So that's why you're gonna use
the drug she made for Michael

24:39.434 --> 24:42.089
to, what, create this-this
elaborate playground

24:42.132 --> 24:43.786
and teach her a lesson?Do you think

24:43.830 --> 24:47.529
we are happy hosting
alien Hatch Day parties?

24:47.573 --> 24:49.139
Without you,
we'd have notoriety.

24:49.183 --> 24:51.968
We'd have power.
We'd have our Nobel prize.

24:52.012 --> 24:53.100
Without you,

24:53.143 --> 24:55.319
the world would have
Liz Ortecho.

24:55.363 --> 24:58.453
You act like you despise me,

24:58.497 --> 25:00.499
but deep down you still love me.

25:01.761 --> 25:04.111
Otherwise, there'd be no need
for this charade.

25:04.154 --> 25:06.026
Let her wake up.

25:07.114 --> 25:08.637
You know I'd never
hold her back.

25:08.681 --> 25:09.812
You gave up your powers.

25:09.856 --> 25:11.422
You can't even protect yourself.

25:11.466 --> 25:14.164
That's not true.Aw.

25:14.208 --> 25:15.818
He lost his snark.

25:15.862 --> 25:17.907
You know,
she may think you are the key

25:17.951 --> 25:20.257
to our greatness but you know,

25:20.301 --> 25:24.348
deep down, you are
our biggest obstacle to it.

25:24.392 --> 25:26.350
Congratulations, Max.

25:26.394 --> 25:28.657
You've locked us into
a life of mediocrity.

25:28.701 --> 25:30.616
She'll never let you be sheriff.

25:31.442 --> 25:33.053
We'll see about that.

25:37.231 --> 25:39.233
[grunts]

25:40.626 --> 25:42.279
Okay.

25:42.323 --> 25:44.151
Where did she take him?

25:48.068 --> 25:51.071
I think my subconscious
took this a little too literal.

25:51.114 --> 25:54.204
You're my rock.

25:54.248 --> 25:55.771
My trusty steed.

25:55.815 --> 25:59.166
Always getting me
where I need to go, but...

25:59.209 --> 26:02.517
right now, I really wish
you were the real Kyle.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.650
[chuckles] All right.

26:04.693 --> 26:06.129
I know, I know.

26:06.173 --> 26:08.218
I know.

26:09.437 --> 26:10.786
My fever's rising.

26:10.830 --> 26:12.353
Oh, it's got to be as a result

26:12.396 --> 26:14.573
of whatever's happening
on the outside.

26:17.706 --> 26:18.707
Hey, Sheriff.

26:18.751 --> 26:20.666
I was up on the derrick,

26:20.709 --> 26:22.885
and I came upon this
strange trail of black gold,

26:22.929 --> 26:24.583
leading out into the desert.

26:24.626 --> 26:25.714
Oil?

26:25.758 --> 26:27.411
Max. Did-did you follow it?

26:27.455 --> 26:28.761
Yeah, yeah.

26:28.804 --> 26:31.067
Dead-ends at, uh,
the old Ghost Town

26:31.111 --> 26:31.894
out on Route 80.

26:31.938 --> 26:32.982
So, I'm thinking,

26:33.026 --> 26:34.375
maybe your evil magical twin

26:34.418 --> 26:35.898
might be holing up out there.

26:35.942 --> 26:39.032
News travels fast,
even in B movie Roswell. Okay.

26:39.075 --> 26:41.164
You and Max always
looked out for me.

26:41.208 --> 26:42.905
Rosa, too, so...

26:42.949 --> 26:45.908
I may not be in apple-pie order,

26:45.952 --> 26:48.258
but whatever you need,
I got you.

26:52.045 --> 26:54.003
That's what I've been missing.

26:54.787 --> 26:57.616
Thank you all for showing up.

26:57.659 --> 26:59.705
I made the mistake of thinking

26:59.748 --> 27:01.271
I could face her alone.

27:01.315 --> 27:02.403
I was wrong.

27:03.578 --> 27:05.885
This ring represents family.

27:05.928 --> 27:07.669
And every time
I don't lean on family,

27:07.713 --> 27:09.497
things end in disaster.

27:09.540 --> 27:11.804
And that's 'cause you guys
are the best part of me.

27:12.805 --> 27:14.241
Fire.

27:14.284 --> 27:15.546
Grit.

27:15.590 --> 27:16.678
Heart, brain,

27:16.722 --> 27:17.766
Conscience.

27:17.810 --> 27:18.941
Together, we're more powerful

27:18.985 --> 27:20.813
than she ever will be.

27:21.814 --> 27:23.642
I believe that
more than anything.

27:24.468 --> 27:26.775
Let's go save Max and Rosa.

27:28.472 --> 27:29.648
Vamos.

27:39.135 --> 27:41.094
Papi,take Maria. Go left.

27:41.137 --> 27:43.705
It's Deputy Machete
at work, mija.

28:05.205 --> 28:06.249
Howdy, folks.

28:14.605 --> 28:16.433
Clyde.

28:25.747 --> 28:26.966
[grunts]

28:28.402 --> 28:30.970
What? Y'all are just
a bunch of coffee boilers.

28:31.579 --> 28:33.146
[high-pitched ringing]

28:33.189 --> 28:34.234
[grunts]

28:39.718 --> 28:40.719
Michael,no, no.

28:40.762 --> 28:42.242
No, no! No.

28:46.289 --> 28:47.856
I did it!

28:47.900 --> 28:50.293
That bastard's met his maker.

28:52.252 --> 28:54.297
Heath?

28:55.603 --> 28:57.561
Heath, hey. Hey.

28:57.605 --> 28:58.954
[gunshot]

29:02.828 --> 29:04.568
Michael killed you.Yeah.

29:04.612 --> 29:07.049
And then I killed him back.

29:08.181 --> 29:09.922
Like I told you at poker,

29:09.965 --> 29:11.227
I'm the villain.

29:11.271 --> 29:12.925
And you know more
than anyone

29:12.968 --> 29:15.884
when one of us falls...

29:17.494 --> 29:20.367
...there's always another
to take his place.

29:27.330 --> 29:29.463
What's going on, Sheriff?They're all dead.

29:30.290 --> 29:32.814
There's more than one.ARTURO: Rosa!

29:32.858 --> 29:35.121
Not again! Please!

29:36.470 --> 29:37.645
My Rosa.

29:37.688 --> 29:38.951
Rosa, please.

29:38.994 --> 29:41.344
Rosa. Please.

29:50.701 --> 29:52.573
It never ends!

29:52.616 --> 29:54.053
OUTLAW LIZ:
Quick study.

29:54.880 --> 29:57.447
No. No, Maria.Liz, I don't understand.

29:58.100 --> 30:00.102
Papi,run!

30:00.146 --> 30:01.451
Too late.[Arturo groans]

30:07.153 --> 30:10.896
You figured it out yet--
the other shoe?

30:12.985 --> 30:14.682
ISOBEL:
Heath!

30:15.378 --> 30:17.990
She's convulsing.
Help me hold her down.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.644
Come on, Liz.

30:20.688 --> 30:21.907
Stay with us. Come on.

30:26.520 --> 30:28.000
Find something
to restrain her!

30:29.784 --> 30:31.742
I got it, doc! [high-pitched ringing]

30:33.353 --> 30:35.529
[monitor beeping]

30:35.572 --> 30:37.444
Max's heart is racing
like a jackrabbit.

30:37.487 --> 30:38.662
We got to wake 'em up.

30:38.706 --> 30:39.881
You finish splicing
the alien virus

30:39.925 --> 30:41.143
to the steroids yet?

30:41.187 --> 30:42.449
Yeah, but I'd like
to test it first.

30:42.492 --> 30:43.842
No, there's no time.
Do it now.

30:46.540 --> 30:47.933
All right, hang tight, Liz.

30:47.976 --> 30:49.630
I'm sending in backup.

30:58.378 --> 30:59.640
[click]

31:07.430 --> 31:09.215
Move! Now!

31:14.220 --> 31:15.786
It's getting worse.

31:15.830 --> 31:17.353
I thought you weren't
interested.I wasn't,

31:17.397 --> 31:19.007
until you considered giving up.

31:19.051 --> 31:20.400
She just killed everyone I love.

31:20.443 --> 31:21.880
The path was never
gonna be easy.

31:21.923 --> 31:23.272
God, come on, Allie.

31:23.316 --> 31:24.534
I thought this was
about trusting my family.

31:24.578 --> 31:25.709
All right, well,
then dig deeper.

31:25.753 --> 31:27.581
Think, Liz. It's the only way.

31:27.624 --> 31:29.844
What does all this mean?
Run through the clues.

31:30.845 --> 31:32.194
The first one

31:32.238 --> 31:34.588
was the message burned
into the ground at my house.

31:34.631 --> 31:36.372
Implying that Max
could die in real life.

31:36.416 --> 31:37.765
Keep going. The ring?

31:37.808 --> 31:39.375
Oh, um...

31:39.419 --> 31:41.638
Marriage, uh, f-family.

31:41.682 --> 31:43.379
Max.

31:43.423 --> 31:45.120
I don't know. I don't know.

31:45.164 --> 31:46.730
Then think harder. What else?

31:46.774 --> 31:49.472
Clyde said the villains
are never gonna stop,

31:49.516 --> 31:51.561
and she keeps asking
about the other shoe...

31:52.301 --> 31:54.782
Something terrible
is always finding us.

31:54.825 --> 31:58.655
So, then, how do we just
drive off into the sunset?

32:01.267 --> 32:03.312
I know what it is.

32:04.661 --> 32:06.054
I know what I'm scared of.

32:06.098 --> 32:07.708
All right,
then it's time to face her.

32:07.751 --> 32:10.058
I'm all out of bullets.

32:10.102 --> 32:11.494
You just need one.

32:12.539 --> 32:14.976
Oh, son of a...Hey, don't even worry about him.

32:15.020 --> 32:17.065
You were always my favorite
student. Go finish this.

32:17.109 --> 32:18.327
Okay.

32:22.201 --> 32:24.203
Hey, you like riddles?

32:24.246 --> 32:26.422
What do you get when you mix
a stockpile of acetone

32:26.466 --> 32:29.295
with a little heat?

32:29.338 --> 32:30.905
Fireworks.

32:33.821 --> 32:35.649
MAX:
Liz?

32:37.129 --> 32:38.173
Max.

32:38.217 --> 32:39.566
Y-Your nose is bleeding.

32:39.609 --> 32:42.003
Th-That drug that you created...

32:42.047 --> 32:43.265
It's killing me, I know.

32:43.309 --> 32:44.397
Listen to me.

32:44.440 --> 32:45.702
Everything she said is a lie,

32:45.746 --> 32:47.095
and I'm gonna get us
out of here.

32:47.139 --> 32:48.967
She-she has a weakness.

32:49.010 --> 32:51.839
She doesn't want to admit it,
but she believes in us.

32:51.882 --> 32:52.971
Just like I do.

32:54.363 --> 32:56.844
[chuckles]
You're my turquoise.

32:56.887 --> 32:58.498
You're mine.

32:58.541 --> 33:01.501
OUTLAW LIZ:
Wade it to the finish line.

33:04.852 --> 33:06.506
What are you gonna
do now, Sheriff?

33:07.376 --> 33:08.508
You won't let him die.

33:08.551 --> 33:10.292
You love him too much.

33:10.336 --> 33:11.815
That's not up to me.

33:11.859 --> 33:14.427
That's up to you
and what you do next.

33:14.470 --> 33:17.299
Have you figured out
why we're here yet?

33:17.343 --> 33:21.086
The scorched message,
Terminator Clyde, the ring.

33:21.912 --> 33:25.960
You want me to admit
why I couldn't say yes.

33:27.179 --> 33:29.311
And can you now?

33:29.355 --> 33:31.661
What's the other shoe,
Elizabeth?

33:33.924 --> 33:35.361
Me.

33:36.188 --> 33:38.494
I'm afraid of myself.

33:39.539 --> 33:42.150
You wanted me to lead
my friends into battle.

33:42.194 --> 33:43.325
Not to show me

33:43.369 --> 33:46.067
that I need to lean on them

33:46.111 --> 33:49.505
but to kill them off
one by one.

33:49.549 --> 33:52.595
You knew it would bring back
the same agony I felt

33:52.639 --> 33:56.295
when I lost Rosa,
and then Max.

33:56.338 --> 33:58.036
And why would I want that?

33:59.037 --> 34:01.300
It's my fear of failure.

34:02.127 --> 34:05.347
I'm afraid next time,
I won't be able to save them.

34:05.391 --> 34:07.654
Now we're getting somewhere.

34:10.004 --> 34:12.876
I said no to Max
because I am terrified

34:12.920 --> 34:15.488
of building
a perfect life with him,

34:15.531 --> 34:17.664
only to have it
torn away from me forever.

34:17.707 --> 34:19.361
OUTLAW LIZ:
And, like Clyde,

34:19.405 --> 34:21.407
the danger will never stop,

34:21.450 --> 34:23.539
especially now that
Max is neutered.

34:23.583 --> 34:26.542
The only way to save them

34:26.586 --> 34:28.892
is to give in to the drug.

34:28.936 --> 34:30.546
Surrender to me.

34:30.590 --> 34:32.418
We both win.

34:33.201 --> 34:34.942
No, Bitch Cassidy.

34:35.725 --> 34:38.728
'Cause your logic is flawed.

34:38.772 --> 34:40.687
Embracing that drug

34:40.730 --> 34:42.167
won't make us stronger.

34:42.210 --> 34:44.212
It'll make us weak.

34:44.256 --> 34:46.606
[high-pitched ringing]

34:47.694 --> 34:49.739
How do you figure?

34:51.437 --> 34:53.265
'Cause there's no guarantee

34:53.308 --> 34:55.919
we would have those same powers
when we wake up.

34:55.963 --> 34:59.097
In fact,
it is statistically improbable.

34:59.140 --> 35:01.055
But we'd be smarter.

35:01.099 --> 35:03.013
You saw Shivani.

35:03.057 --> 35:04.972
She's like Einstein
and Allie Meyers.

35:05.015 --> 35:06.669
The brain damage we would have,

35:06.713 --> 35:08.584
the-the memory loss,
the nerve degeneration,

35:08.628 --> 35:10.630
we could
lose ourselves entirely.

35:10.673 --> 35:13.154
But allowing the drug
to open our mind

35:13.198 --> 35:16.636
would make fixing that
child's play.

35:17.463 --> 35:19.117
Don't you want to live

35:19.160 --> 35:20.161
without fear, Liz?

35:20.205 --> 35:22.163
Of course I do.

35:22.207 --> 35:24.209
And the next time that
something comes for Max,

35:24.252 --> 35:26.254
Rosa, Papi,any of them,

35:26.298 --> 35:27.777
don't you want to destroy it?

35:27.821 --> 35:28.909
Yes!

35:28.952 --> 35:30.606
Then stop gambling
with their lives.

35:30.650 --> 35:32.956
Embrace the power
at our fingertips,

35:33.000 --> 35:34.219
and you will never

35:34.262 --> 35:36.612
fear death again.Don't, Liz, it's too risky.

35:36.656 --> 35:37.961
Nothing is too risky

35:38.005 --> 35:39.485
when it comes
to the people we love.

35:39.528 --> 35:41.356
Look at you.

35:41.400 --> 35:42.618
We're dying, Liz.

35:42.662 --> 35:44.577
It's time to make a decision.

35:44.620 --> 35:46.056
What are you going to do

35:46.100 --> 35:48.581
with that one bullet
we have left?

35:51.801 --> 35:53.760
Don't give up, Liz.

35:57.285 --> 35:58.634
[gunshot]

35:58.678 --> 36:00.723
[gasps] Liz.

36:00.767 --> 36:02.160
Liz? Liz. Where's Liz?

36:02.943 --> 36:05.772
MICHAEL:
Why isn't she waking up?

36:06.816 --> 36:08.949
[gasps] I'm here.

36:10.429 --> 36:12.692
I'm here.

36:17.262 --> 36:19.264
â™ª It's like rain... Oh.

36:20.874 --> 36:22.963
So, you're telling me that you
don't remember anything?

36:23.006 --> 36:24.399
I mean, isn't that a little odd

36:24.443 --> 36:26.488
for one of
the mindscape adventure?

36:26.532 --> 36:29.056
This was, like,
part fever dream,

36:29.099 --> 36:30.666
so the rules
must work differently.

36:30.710 --> 36:34.192
Suppose your massive hit
of alien mist could be to blame.

36:34.235 --> 36:35.671
[chuckles]

36:35.715 --> 36:37.064
Either way,

36:37.107 --> 36:39.588
glad your body was able
to fight it off.

36:39.632 --> 36:41.242
Any idea how?

36:41.286 --> 36:43.375
Not a good enough doc yet
to get specific,

36:43.418 --> 36:44.898
but, uh,

36:44.941 --> 36:48.293
it looks like your body
just stopped fighting itself.

36:48.336 --> 36:49.903
Or it might've had
something to do

36:49.946 --> 36:51.513
with your brilliant

36:51.557 --> 36:53.863
steroid-alien-virus
concoction thingy.No,

36:53.907 --> 36:56.039
no, Michael and I
just bought you some time.

36:56.083 --> 36:58.216
Med school looks good on you.

36:59.042 --> 37:00.479
Yeah.

37:00.522 --> 37:02.394
Not sure I can stay, though.

37:03.264 --> 37:04.831
With Dallas missing,

37:04.874 --> 37:06.049
it's just...

37:06.093 --> 37:08.269
He's my brother.

37:08.313 --> 37:10.097
â™ª It's like rain...

37:10.140 --> 37:12.491
We're gonna find him. I promise.

37:12.534 --> 37:15.233
I kind of owe you one, so...

37:15.276 --> 37:17.278
[chuckles] Yeah.

37:17.322 --> 37:20.063
I mean, it's still...

37:20.107 --> 37:23.023
unclear how you even knew
I was in trouble.

37:23.066 --> 37:24.851
Uh...

37:24.894 --> 37:26.374
because I told him.

37:26.418 --> 37:28.115
â™ª And who would've thought?
It figures... â™ª

37:28.158 --> 37:30.248
Um...

37:30.291 --> 37:33.555
we've become... friends

37:33.599 --> 37:35.427
in New York.[short chuckle]

37:35.470 --> 37:37.385
Okay. Tell me everything.

37:37.429 --> 37:39.257
Is it, like,
dinners and dancing,

37:39.300 --> 37:40.780
or VIP membership to the MoMA?

37:40.823 --> 37:43.826
He's helping me figure out
the source of my powers.

37:43.870 --> 37:45.350
So that I can...

37:45.393 --> 37:47.265
control them better.

37:48.004 --> 37:50.355
Look.

37:50.398 --> 37:52.966
[high-pitched ringing][music stops]

37:53.009 --> 37:55.751
You can cancel sound now?

37:55.795 --> 37:58.798
Well, more like bend
the sound waves

37:58.841 --> 38:00.452
so that you can't hear them.

38:03.411 --> 38:06.588
Not really sure
what it's good for, but...

38:07.459 --> 38:08.808
I wanted to tell you.

38:08.851 --> 38:11.027
I'm sorry I didn't call more.

38:11.071 --> 38:12.855
That is not just on you.

38:12.899 --> 38:14.466
Well...

38:14.509 --> 38:17.338
to make up for it,
I'm gonna stay the week.

38:17.382 --> 38:18.600
Unlike medicine,

38:21.690 --> 38:23.779
[speaks Spanish]

38:25.520 --> 38:27.130
How'd you manage
to keep it together?

38:27.174 --> 38:30.438
You were the only one who
didn't completely unravel today.

38:30.482 --> 38:33.789
I just decided
it wasn't my turn.

38:35.008 --> 38:36.226
Dallas reminded me that

38:36.270 --> 38:38.228
strength comes from your family.

38:38.272 --> 38:40.361
He's been a big part of mine
lately.

38:40.405 --> 38:43.669
I had to make sure
that we survived today

38:43.712 --> 38:45.932
so we could all
return the favor.

38:47.368 --> 38:49.327
And we did.

38:49.370 --> 38:50.893
Thanks, in part, to you.

38:50.937 --> 38:52.721
[exhales]

38:53.548 --> 38:55.158
Think it's time I figure out

38:55.202 --> 38:56.856
how to get the three of them
out of that sinkhole.

38:56.899 --> 38:59.032
Any ideas where to start?

38:59.075 --> 39:00.250
I got a few theories.

39:00.294 --> 39:02.470
Me too.Hmm.

39:02.514 --> 39:05.255
I'm gonna spend some time
honing my new abilities.

39:05.299 --> 39:07.345
We're gonna find 'em.

39:08.737 --> 39:10.609
I know.

39:14.569 --> 39:16.571
I was worried about you,
you know,

39:16.615 --> 39:18.747
when you got calf-roped
by a cowboy.

39:20.575 --> 39:22.621
Would've helped you,
but I got shot.

39:22.664 --> 39:24.884
Well, you stayed by my side.

39:24.927 --> 39:26.451
You felt that?

39:28.235 --> 39:29.541
Thank you.

39:30.977 --> 39:32.674
I wish I could be
the one to take credit

39:32.718 --> 39:34.676
for getting you
out of Dodge, but, uh...

39:34.720 --> 39:36.243
How did you manage to escape?

39:36.286 --> 39:39.507
Oh, Bad Liz drew my Liz
into a duel.

39:39.551 --> 39:41.553
Yeah, I didn't see what
happened after that,

39:41.596 --> 39:43.642
but I heard a gunshot
and then I woke up.

39:43.685 --> 39:46.209
So I guess the right Liz won,
or I wouldn't be here.

39:46.253 --> 39:48.690
Just wish I could remember
what happened in there.

39:48.734 --> 39:51.650
Well, I'm sure that Max will be
happy to tell you all about it.

39:51.693 --> 39:54.435
I, myself, have a date
with an alien in a cage.

39:54.479 --> 39:57.264
Excuse me.Oh, you learned something
from Tezca?

39:57.307 --> 39:59.266
Yeah, I did. I learned that

39:59.309 --> 40:01.094
she's so much more
than Ophiuchus.

40:01.137 --> 40:04.271
She was fearless and kind.

40:05.011 --> 40:06.447
Before Jones got to her.

40:07.709 --> 40:09.668
You know, I started a school
to help women,

40:09.711 --> 40:11.147
so...

40:11.191 --> 40:12.932
I figure this is my shot.

40:14.281 --> 40:15.848
Goodnight.

40:17.327 --> 40:19.242
Oh, yeah.
Just reminded me.

40:19.286 --> 40:21.027
I should check in on Shivani.

[door opens]Oh, Michael just heard
from Senovative.

40:23.246 --> 40:26.380
[door closes]I guess she had an easier
time of it than you did.

40:26.424 --> 40:27.512
She's already back at work.

40:27.555 --> 40:30.384
So, you know what that means.

40:31.211 --> 40:33.692
I don't have to worry about it.

40:33.735 --> 40:34.867
Yeah.

40:34.910 --> 40:36.259
What you do need

40:36.303 --> 40:38.348
is to relax by a warm fire

40:38.392 --> 40:40.829
with a glass of merlot

40:40.873 --> 40:43.049
and the cowboy
of your dreams.

40:43.092 --> 40:44.529
That you don't remember.
