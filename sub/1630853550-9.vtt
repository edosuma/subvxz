Max doesn't want the cure.
He's made his choice.

00:06.919 --> 00:08.443
What happened to the mist?Might've inhaled a bit.

00:08.486 --> 00:10.140
It's opened my mind up
to infinite possibilities,

00:10.184 --> 00:11.837
including one that is
so close to my heart.

That mist will not
regenerate human cells.

Liz Ortecho

sure you know what you're doing?

No, I got no idea

No, they kept her at Senovative.
She's not as bad.

Liz must've taken
the brunt of that mist.

00:43.956 --> 00:46.176
Valenti, you got any idea
what a-a gallon

00:46.220 --> 00:47.525

solution could do to a human?

Yeah, it's a long story.
Did you call your dad?

00:54.837 --> 00:56.099
No. About alien drugs?
Absolutely not.

here screaming over

01:03.063 --> 01:04.542
at Deep Sky that can help us?

01:04.586 --> 01:05.674
He said there's no one
who knows more

01:05.717 --> 01:07.023
about alien science than me.

01:07.632 --> 01:08.894
Which is comforting
to no one, so...

01:08.938 --> 01:10.461
We need to find the naloxone.

01:10.505 --> 01:11.767
Valenti said it'll block
the drug, reverse its effects.

01:11.810 --> 01:13.725
That's for opioids,

01:13.769 --> 01:15.727
not alien narcotics.
How can he be so sure

01:15.771 --> 01:17.338
that that's gonna work?He can't.

Valenti said it needs to be

01:28.436 --> 01:30.046
closer to 60.Okay, this is an alien problem.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.222
Maybe we need to attack it
in an alien way.

01:32.266 --> 01:35.138
If we jump into her mind...But she's comatose and
you are basically human.

01:35.182 --> 01:37.009
We have no idea what
this is dong to her brain.Right.

01:37.053 --> 01:38.707
Exactly, which is why we need
to talk to a scientist.

01:38.750 --> 01:40.056
No offense, Michael.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.406
Okay, well, I will go in,
then, alone.

in there, it's me.

No, I think you got it.
I got to make a phone call.

You ready for this?

how does a gunslinger

in that compound

06:36.265 --> 06:37.527
grafted onto Liz's cells,

the ability to...

06:39.311 --> 06:41.879

In other words, Max is struck
in there until Liz wakes up?

Hey. How's it going?Well,

13:36.337 --> 13:38.339
the drug has latched on
to Liz's nerve receptors.

13:38.382 --> 13:41.211
Somehow it's managed to trick
her immune system into thinking

13:41.255 --> 13:43.518
that her own nerves
are actually foreign bodies.

13:43.561 --> 13:45.085
Which would be an easy fix,

13:45.128 --> 13:46.651
if I had a way
to camouflage alien proteins

13:46.695 --> 13:48.218
inside human biology.

13:48.262 --> 13:50.699
Unfortunately, NYU hasn't
quite gotten there yet.

13:51.526 --> 13:52.875
Thank you for not giving up.

13:52.919 --> 13:54.181
Yeah.

13:54.224 --> 13:55.530
So, uh...

13:55.573 --> 13:58.533
how long has Dallas
been missing?

13:58.576 --> 14:00.187
No more than a day.

14:00.230 --> 14:01.666
Listen, I'm sorry

14:01.710 --> 14:03.755
that I didn't
tell you over the phone.

14:03.799 --> 14:05.583
I just thought that
you should hear it in person.

14:05.627 --> 14:06.933
You know, I almost didn't
go back to med school.

14:06.976 --> 14:08.891
I didn't want
to leave Dallas.

14:08.935 --> 14:11.328
But I convinced myself
that he would be okay

14:11.372 --> 14:13.853
because he has
his little threesome.

14:13.896 --> 14:15.855
Triad.He had Isobel and Michael
to help him

14:15.898 --> 14:17.552
understand who he is.
He had Liz and Kyle

14:17.595 --> 14:18.988
in case he got sick again.

14:19.032 --> 14:22.035
I mean, what could possibly
go wrong, right?

14:22.078 --> 14:24.298
Look, I-I'm sorry.

14:24.341 --> 14:26.691
I-I distracted you.

It's not your fault.

14:35.396 --> 14:37.920
[clears throat]
Hey.

14:37.964 --> 14:39.487
I was getting
a little antsy,

14:39.530 --> 14:42.185
thought maybe you needed
some caffeine,

14:42.229 --> 14:44.361
but I can see you guys are busy,

14:44.405 --> 14:45.754
so...

14:47.538 --> 14:49.714
I'm gonna go.

14:50.541 --> 14:51.499
Hey.

14:51.542 --> 14:53.675
Look, Bikini Kill.

14:53.718 --> 14:56.460
Liz, she's got her boyfriend.

14:56.504 --> 14:58.158
You've got your boyfriend.

14:58.201 --> 14:59.202
[scoffs]

14:59.246 --> 15:00.464
I'm-a go get my boyfriend.

15:00.508 --> 15:02.118
Heath is not
my boyfriend, okay?

15:02.162 --> 15:03.903
People hug when they're sad.

15:03.946 --> 15:05.426
You stepped outside
to make a call

15:05.469 --> 15:07.036
and 30 minutes later,
Heath swooped in.

15:07.080 --> 15:09.386
So either Dr. Feelgood
came to town with you, or...

15:09.430 --> 15:11.301
did you developed
beam-me-up powers?

15:11.345 --> 15:12.563
Or Heath came yesterday.

15:12.607 --> 15:14.043
After you told me about Dallas.

15:14.087 --> 15:17.568
Look, he's been
helping me. When I

15:17.612 --> 15:19.919
got to New York,
Parsons was great.

15:19.962 --> 15:21.572
All right? It
was everything

15:21.616 --> 15:23.052
that I needed, but it didn't
take me that long

15:23.096 --> 15:25.402
to figure out that
art is only one part of me,

15:25.446 --> 15:27.448
and there's a whole
huge other part

15:27.491 --> 15:28.840
that, unless I explore it,

15:28.884 --> 15:30.407
I'm never gonna be
who I actually am.

15:30.451 --> 15:32.975
So you called Heath
to help you be a better alien?

15:33.019 --> 15:34.542
He's the only one
who knows alien DNA.

15:34.585 --> 15:35.673
What about your sister?

15:35.717 --> 15:37.240
And your brother?

15:37.284 --> 15:38.720
There's no way that
I'm gonna have them knowing

15:38.763 --> 15:39.764
that I feel lost.

15:39.808 --> 15:41.070
You know how sick I am

15:41.114 --> 15:43.290
of feeling like I am
the needy sister.

15:43.333 --> 15:44.900
[sighs]

15:46.162 --> 15:47.772
I get that.

15:47.816 --> 15:49.165
I just really made a huge
mistake by cutting myself off.

15:49.209 --> 15:51.167
I think that
if I had stayed connected

15:51.211 --> 15:53.387
to the things that are important
I could've seen this coming.

15:53.430 --> 15:54.692
Max is with Liz
every single day,

15:54.736 --> 15:56.825
and even he didn't
see it coming.

15:56.868 --> 15:58.740
I know, I just
feel helpless.

16:00.524 --> 16:02.744
But I'm guessing
that you do, too.

16:02.787 --> 16:04.354
It was bad enough
when Alex went missing,

16:04.398 --> 16:06.443
but now that I know
he's trapped

16:06.487 --> 16:09.272
in an alien-engineered
sinkhole, yeah--

16:09.316 --> 16:10.970
sitting here
doing nothing sucks.

16:11.883 --> 16:13.668
Max jumped into a mindscape
after the woman he loves.

16:13.711 --> 16:16.801
The least I can do is jump into
a sinkhole to save my soulmate.

16:16.845 --> 16:18.325
Do you remember what
happened the last time

16:18.368 --> 16:19.891
that you abandoned all logic?

16:19.935 --> 16:22.764
You threw me in a car
and then blew me up.

16:22.807 --> 16:25.158
Don't make
the same mistake twice.

16:25.201 --> 16:26.376
Listen, I know

16:26.420 --> 16:27.856
that you want to help,

16:27.899 --> 16:29.510
but cannonballing
into a sinkhole after Alex

16:29.553 --> 16:30.685
isn't gonna help anybody.

16:30.728 --> 16:31.991
Right now,

16:32.034 --> 16:33.644
Heath is in there,
really struggling

16:33.688 --> 16:35.255
to figure out
how to camouflage alien protein,

16:35.298 --> 16:37.300
and Kyle said that
you're the only one

16:37.344 --> 16:38.780
who can help.

16:39.607 --> 16:41.609
Fine. But I don't know if...

16:42.914 --> 16:44.525
Has he tried Max's blood yet?

16:44.568 --> 16:46.831
Liz said Bonnie's virus
mutes alien DNA.

16:46.875 --> 16:48.355
So if it's still in him,

16:48.398 --> 16:50.748
maybe we could reengineer it
to bolster the steroids.

16:50.792 --> 16:52.663
Okay, why are we still
standing here? Go.

17:02.456 --> 17:04.980
Hi, uh...

17:05.024 --> 17:07.113
my sister said
I used to come here for help,

17:07.156 --> 17:09.724
and I could really
use some right now.

17:09.767 --> 17:11.769
Are you the old Sheriff?

17:11.813 --> 17:13.989
I was your old teacher, but...

17:14.033 --> 17:16.905
I guess the mentor part's
what counts.

17:17.688 --> 17:20.082
[chuckles]

17:20.126 --> 17:21.301
Allie Meyers.

17:22.606 --> 17:24.869
You know this...
this isn't real, right?

17:24.913 --> 17:26.697
Uh-huh.

17:26.741 --> 17:29.091
So, you here
to talk circular mRNA

17:29.135 --> 17:33.182
or why you're stuck in
Once Upon a Time in Roswell?

17:33.226 --> 17:35.097
I want to know
why there are two of me.

17:35.141 --> 17:37.099
You really need to conjure me
to tell you

17:37.143 --> 17:40.189
that in most big choices in life
we're of two minds?

17:41.190 --> 17:42.713
The question is...

17:42.757 --> 17:44.541
what are you weighing out?

17:44.585 --> 17:47.327
Well, before I ended up here,

17:47.370 --> 17:49.068
I-I was thinking about the drug.

17:49.111 --> 17:51.418
And how on one hand
it's dangerous, but...

17:51.461 --> 17:53.985
on the other hand,
it could accomplish so much.

17:54.029 --> 17:56.727
But I had already made
the decision not to take it.

17:56.771 --> 17:59.556
I think your other half
is pissed.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.732
So she took
Shivani's words literally

18:01.776 --> 18:03.082
and trapped me
in a dried-up dairy town?

18:03.125 --> 18:04.735
Only now I'm
the Tin Starcowboy?

18:04.779 --> 18:06.389
She did what you do
in the lab.

18:06.433 --> 18:07.608
Created a scenario

18:07.651 --> 18:09.088
for you to suss out an answer,

18:09.131 --> 18:11.307
trading petri dishes
for six-shooters.

18:11.351 --> 18:12.395
An answer to what question?

18:12.439 --> 18:13.962
I mean,

18:14.005 --> 18:15.964
all I know is that
it has to do with Max dying,

18:16.007 --> 18:18.749
and-and apparently
Abuela'sring?

18:18.793 --> 18:22.405
[chuckles] She's definitely
relishing being in the saddle.

18:22.449 --> 18:24.015
You--

18:24.059 --> 18:25.408
you got to keep
playing the game.

18:25.452 --> 18:26.757
No, God, I'm tired
of the game, Allie.

18:26.801 --> 18:28.759
How do I wake up?Simple.

18:28.803 --> 18:30.413
Follow the path,
figure out what it is

18:30.457 --> 18:31.893
that you don't want to confront.

18:37.855 --> 18:40.554
You know, she-she's just
one part of me, right?

18:40.597 --> 18:41.946
Like a split personality.

18:41.990 --> 18:44.079
So I don't need her to survive.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.560
There are no shortcuts, Liz.

18:46.603 --> 18:48.257
Whatever dark truth
she's carrying,

18:48.301 --> 18:50.216
you're gonna have to face
eventually.

18:50.259 --> 18:51.391
I disagree.

18:52.479 --> 18:53.697
Come on, ride with me.

18:53.741 --> 18:55.438
Sorry, kid.

18:55.482 --> 18:58.224
If you don't want to listen,
you're on your own.

18:59.660 --> 19:01.009
[sighs]

19:03.446 --> 19:05.666
[hoofbeats approaching]

19:14.022 --> 19:16.155
Liz. Oh, thank God.

19:17.808 --> 19:20.289
We're gonna take a walk.

19:20.985 --> 19:22.639
No, Liz,
you-you have to wake up.

19:22.683 --> 19:24.337
That-that drug you took--
it's poison. It's killing you.

19:24.380 --> 19:26.643
Stopping the drug
would be counterproductive.

19:26.687 --> 19:28.036
It isn't killing me.

19:28.079 --> 19:29.690
It's making me stronger.

19:29.733 --> 19:31.779
You took it on purpose.

19:32.954 --> 19:36.218
As much as I'd like
to take credit...

19:36.262 --> 19:37.567
Shivani dosed me.

19:37.611 --> 19:39.482
But it was serendipity.

19:39.526 --> 19:41.136
Like a girl

19:41.180 --> 19:45.009
crossing paths with a sheriff
and his magic hands

19:45.053 --> 19:46.794
on the night
that she was shot.

19:46.837 --> 19:49.840
Accidents are the spark
of evolution.

19:49.884 --> 19:51.886
The other Liz disagrees.

19:54.671 --> 19:56.673
The other Liz? [grunts]

19:56.717 --> 20:00.199
She's been in charge
for far too long.

20:00.242 --> 20:03.027
Been searching for a way
to show her that she's lost,

20:03.071 --> 20:05.029
and then you showed up--
perfect pawn.

20:05.073 --> 20:06.379
Can I get some water?

20:09.251 --> 20:11.514
Looks like your sheriff
finally wised up

20:11.558 --> 20:13.386
and asked for a meeting.

20:14.169 --> 20:16.258
You better hope
she's ready to surrender.

20:25.963 --> 20:28.879
So you're raising
the white flag.

20:29.706 --> 20:31.142
Actually,
I'm ready to wake up.

20:31.186 --> 20:32.622
And you think that's
your choice?

20:32.666 --> 20:33.884
I know it's not.

20:33.928 --> 20:35.538
I need you
to want to wake up, too,

20:35.582 --> 20:38.280
which is why I'm extending
an olive branch.

20:40.848 --> 20:42.284
Let's parley.

20:42.328 --> 20:43.677
Cute, but no.

20:43.720 --> 20:44.982
Well, then I'm afraid
this town ain't big enough

20:45.026 --> 20:46.245
for the both of us.

20:49.813 --> 20:51.902
Now that I have your attention,

20:51.946 --> 20:53.556
I did some thinking.

20:53.600 --> 20:54.688
Hmm.

20:54.731 --> 20:56.255
All you are is a manifestation

20:56.298 --> 20:58.996
of a dark,
fleeting impulse I had

20:59.040 --> 21:00.433
in a moment of weakness.

21:00.476 --> 21:02.217
You were born
out of a schism in my mind

21:02.261 --> 21:03.914
that has been allowed
to grow too deep.

21:03.958 --> 21:06.917
So if I take you out,
rid myself of

21:06.961 --> 21:08.267
that dangerous urge,

21:08.310 --> 21:10.965
there is nothing
anchoring me or Max

21:11.008 --> 21:13.184
to this place.Pull the trigger.

21:13.228 --> 21:15.709
But know that if you do,
Max's death will be on you.

21:15.752 --> 21:16.797
Max won't die.

21:16.840 --> 21:18.755
When I wake up, so will he.

21:18.799 --> 21:20.453
And then what happens next?

21:20.496 --> 21:22.411
Without me,

21:22.455 --> 21:24.631
you'll be too scared
to protect him.

21:24.674 --> 21:26.067
Scared of what, exactly?

21:26.110 --> 21:27.590
The other shoe to drop.

21:27.634 --> 21:29.157
Right now,
you're just

21:29.200 --> 21:30.550
refusing to face it.

21:30.593 --> 21:31.986
I'll figure it out.

21:39.646 --> 21:41.430
How did you do that?

21:41.474 --> 21:43.867
It's a metaphor, Liz.

21:43.911 --> 21:45.565
[high-pitched ringing]

21:45.608 --> 21:48.829
For how strong we'll be
on the other side.

21:49.525 --> 21:50.613
See you at high noon.

21:50.657 --> 21:52.311
[high-pitched ringing]

22:01.537 --> 22:04.279
I need you to find Liz.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.847
And wake up, okay?

22:06.890 --> 22:08.979
'Cause I'm the one
that let you go in there

22:09.023 --> 22:10.633
without a way
to defend yourself.

22:10.677 --> 22:12.156
MARIA:
Hey, how you doing?

22:12.200 --> 22:13.767
Good, yeah. I'm good.

22:13.810 --> 22:17.031
Well, Heath and Michael
are now in the lab,

22:17.074 --> 22:18.641
furiously mixing up an elixir

22:18.685 --> 22:22.079
that-- I quote-- "will shield
Liz's neural receptors,

22:22.123 --> 22:23.690
"buying her some time

22:23.733 --> 22:26.083
so she can kick
this thing's ass."

22:26.127 --> 22:28.999
Liz and Max are in good hands.

22:29.739 --> 22:31.654
ISOBEL:
I knew it was a bad idea

22:31.698 --> 22:34.657
to let him in to Liz's mind.

22:34.701 --> 22:36.006
And now he's trapped there,

22:36.050 --> 22:37.660
and we don't even
have Kyle to help us.

22:37.704 --> 22:39.619
And that's also my fault,
by the way.

22:39.662 --> 22:41.447
How is Kyle your fault?

22:43.100 --> 22:44.450
Oh.

22:44.493 --> 22:45.929
You slept with him.

22:46.930 --> 22:48.192
Yeah.

22:48.236 --> 22:50.020
And it was kind of spectacular.

22:50.891 --> 22:52.153
[chuckles]

22:52.196 --> 22:54.851
Until I, uh, cold-shouldered him
and ran away.

22:54.895 --> 22:56.418
You just got out of
a relationship.

22:56.462 --> 22:58.638
I'm sure he understands.Yeah, no, he does.

22:58.681 --> 23:01.510
Which is why he told me
he would wait for me.

23:01.554 --> 23:03.512
And then I told him
not to bother,

23:03.556 --> 23:06.907
because, um,
I destroy everything I touch.

23:06.950 --> 23:08.909
Like Anatsa.

23:10.737 --> 23:11.912
And Max.

23:11.955 --> 23:13.392
Hey, come on.

23:13.435 --> 23:15.698
Where's all this coming from?

23:15.742 --> 23:18.788
I saw Tezca's memories, Maria.

23:19.963 --> 23:23.053
She wasn't just my teacher.
She was my hero.

23:23.097 --> 23:24.925
And when Jones
came for her,

23:24.968 --> 23:26.317
I did nothing.

23:26.361 --> 23:28.407
I hid, like a coward.

23:28.450 --> 23:29.712
You were seven years old.

23:29.756 --> 23:31.192
I could've at least
done something.

23:31.235 --> 23:32.846
If you had confronted Jones
back then,

23:32.889 --> 23:34.543
he would've taken you, too.

23:34.587 --> 23:36.545
And we wouldn't be at war
with just Tezca.

23:36.589 --> 23:38.242
It'd be you as well.

23:38.286 --> 23:40.767
She saved me.

23:41.768 --> 23:43.639
And it destroyed her.Hey.

23:43.683 --> 23:45.554
You can save her right back.

23:45.598 --> 23:47.904
This isn't about
Kyle or Anatsa.

23:47.948 --> 23:50.603
This is about this moment,
right now.

23:52.343 --> 23:53.693
Stop trying to convince yourself

23:53.736 --> 23:55.782
that you're less
than what you are, Isobel.

23:56.609 --> 23:58.567
You're a warrior.

23:58.611 --> 24:00.874
You have a dojo to prove it.

24:00.917 --> 24:02.963
[chuckles]

24:08.490 --> 24:10.579
So, you're what, Liz's id?

24:10.623 --> 24:12.842
And the sheriff is
her-her moral conscience?

24:12.886 --> 24:14.931
No wonder she would
never surrender to you.

24:14.975 --> 24:17.586
She's prepared to let you die.
She's stupider than I thought.

24:17.630 --> 24:19.196
[chuckles]
Or you've got it backwards

24:19.240 --> 24:20.589
and you're the stupid one.

24:20.633 --> 24:21.764
There's a reason
she's the sheriff

24:21.808 --> 24:23.200
and you're just a villain.

24:23.244 --> 24:25.594
Yeah, there is. You.

24:25.638 --> 24:27.901
[chuckles softly]

24:27.944 --> 24:29.424
You know, she's repressed you

24:29.468 --> 24:31.644
because you're everything
she hates.

24:31.687 --> 24:33.733
You're selfish,
impatient, callous.

24:33.776 --> 24:34.864
And stronger.

24:34.908 --> 24:36.605
She's given up
on what we want.

24:36.649 --> 24:39.390
So that's why you're gonna use
the drug she made for Michael

24:39.434 --> 24:42.089
to, what, create this-this
elaborate playground

24:42.132 --> 24:43.786
and teach her a lesson?Do you think

24:43.830 --> 24:47.529
we are happy hosting
alien Hatch Day parties?

24:47.573 --> 24:49.139
Without you,
we'd have notoriety.

24:49.183 --> 24:51.968
We'd have power.
We'd have our Nobel prize.

24:52.012 --> 24:53.100
Without you,

24:53.143 --> 24:55.319
the world would have
Liz Ortecho.

24:55.363 --> 24:58.453
You act like you despise me,

24:58.497 --> 25:00.499
but deep down you still love me.

25:01.761 --> 25:04.111
Otherwise, there'd be no need
for this charade.

25:04.154 --> 25:06.026
Let her wake up.

25:07.114 --> 25:08.637
You know I'd never
hold her back.

25:08.681 --> 25:09.812
You gave up your powers.

25:09.856 --> 25:11.422
You can't even protect yourself.

25:11.466 --> 25:14.164
That's not true.Aw.

25:14.208 --> 25:15.818
He lost his snark.

25:15.862 --> 25:17.907
You know,
she may think you are the key

25:17.951 --> 25:20.257
to our greatness but you know,

25:20.301 --> 25:24.348
deep down, you are
our biggest obstacle to it.

25:24.392 --> 25:26.350
Congratulations, Max.

25:26.394 --> 25:28.657
You've locked us into
a life of mediocrity.

25:28.701 --> 25:30.616
She'll never let you be sheriff.

25:31.442 --> 25:33.053
We'll see about that.

25:37.231 --> 25:39.233
[grunts]

25:40.626 --> 25:42.279
Okay.

25:42.323 --> 25:44.151
Where did she take him?

25:48.068 --> 25:51.071
I think my subconscious
took this a little too literal.

25:51.114 --> 25:54.204
You're my rock.

25:54.248 --> 25:55.771
My trusty steed.

25:55.815 --> 25:59.166
Always getting me
where I need to go, but...

25:59.209 --> 26:02.517
right now, I really wish
you were the real Kyle.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.650
[chuckles] All right.

26:04.693 --> 26:06.129
I know, I know.

26:06.173 --> 26:08.218
I know.

26:09.437 --> 26:10.786
My fever's rising.

26:10.830 --> 26:12.353
Oh, it's got to be as a result

26:12.396 --> 26:14.573
of whatever's happening
on the outside.

26:17.706 --> 26:18.707
Hey, Sheriff.

26:18.751 --> 26:20.666
I was up on the derrick,

26:20.709 --> 26:22.885
and I came upon this
strange trail of black gold,

26:22.929 --> 26:24.583
leading out into the desert.

26:24.626 --> 26:25.714
Oil?

26:25.758 --> 26:27.411
Max. Did-did you follow it?

26:27.455 --> 26:28.761
Yeah, yeah.

26:28.804 --> 26:31.067
Dead-ends at, uh,
the old Ghost Town

26:31.111 --> 26:31.894
out on Route 80.

26:31.938 --> 26:32.982
So, I'm thinking,

26:33.026 --> 26:34.375
maybe your evil magical twin

26:34.418 --> 26:35.898
might be holing up out there.

26:35.942 --> 26:39.032
News travels fast,
even in B movie Roswell. Okay.

26:39.075 --> 26:41.164
You and Max always
looked out for me.

26:41.208 --> 26:42.905
Rosa, too, so...

26:42.949 --> 26:45.908
I may not be in apple-pie order,

26:45.952 --> 26:48.258
but whatever you need,
I got you.

26:52.045 --> 26:54.003
That's what I've been missing.

26:54.787 --> 26:57.616
Thank you all for showing up.

26:57.659 --> 26:59.705
I made the mistake of thinking

26:59.748 --> 27:01.271
I could face her alone.

27:01.315 --> 27:02.403
I was wrong.

27:03.578 --> 27:05.885
This ring represents family.

27:05.928 --> 27:07.669
And every time
I don't lean on family,

27:07.713 --> 27:09.497
things end in disaster.

27:09.540 --> 27:11.804
And that's 'cause you guys
are the best part of me.

27:12.805 --> 27:14.241
Fire.

27:14.284 --> 27:15.546
Grit.

27:15.590 --> 27:16.678
Heart, brain,

27:16.722 --> 27:17.766
Conscience.

27:17.810 --> 27:18.941
Together, we're more powerful

27:18.985 --> 27:20.813
than she ever will be.

27:21.814 --> 27:23.642
I believe that
more than anything.

27:24.468 --> 27:26.775
Let's go save Max and Rosa.

27:28.472 --> 27:29.648
Vamos.

27:39.135 --> 27:41.094
Papi,take Maria. Go left.

27:41.137 --> 27:43.705
It's Deputy Machete
at work, mija.

28:05.205 --> 28:06.249
Howdy, folks.

28:14.605 --> 28:16.433
Clyde.

28:25.747 --> 28:26.966
[grunts]

28:28.402 --> 28:30.970
What? Y'all are just
a bunch of coffee boilers.

28:31.579 --> 28:33.146
[high-pitched ringing]

28:33.189 --> 28:34.234
[grunts]

28:39.718 --> 28:40.719
Michael,no, no.

28:40.762 --> 28:42.242
No, no! No.

28:46.289 --> 28:47.856
I did it!

28:47.900 --> 28:50.293
That bastard's met his maker.

28:52.252 --> 28:54.297
Heath?

28:55.603 --> 28:57.561
Heath, hey. Hey.

28:57.605 --> 28:58.954
[gunshot]

29:02.828 --> 29:04.568
Michael killed you.Yeah.

29:04.612 --> 29:07.049
And then I killed him back.

29:08.181 --> 29:09.922
Like I told you at poker,

29:09.965 --> 29:11.227
I'm the villain.

29:11.271 --> 29:12.925
And you know more
than anyone

29:12.968 --> 29:15.884
when one of us falls...

29:17.494 --> 29:20.367
...there's always another
to take his place.

29:27.330 --> 29:29.463
What's going on, Sheriff?They're all dead.

29:30.290 --> 29:32.814
There's more than one.ARTURO: Rosa!

29:32.858 --> 29:35.121
Not again! Please!

29:36.470 --> 29:37.645
My Rosa.

29:37.688 --> 29:38.951
Rosa, please.

29:38.994 --> 29:41.344
Rosa. Please.

29:50.701 --> 29:52.573
It never ends!

29:52.616 --> 29:54.053
OUTLAW LIZ:
Quick study.

29:54.880 --> 29:57.447
No. No, Maria.Liz, I don't understand.

29:58.100 --> 30:00.102
Papi,run!

30:00.146 --> 30:01.451
Too late.[Arturo groans]

30:07.153 --> 30:10.896
You figured it out yet--
the other shoe?

30:12.985 --> 30:14.682
ISOBEL:
Heath!

30:15.378 --> 30:17.990
She's convulsing.
Help me hold her down.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.644
Come on, Liz.

30:20.688 --> 30:21.907
Stay with us. Come on.

30:26.520 --> 30:28.000
Find something
to restrain her!

30:29.784 --> 30:31.742
I got it, doc! [high-pitched ringing]

30:33.353 --> 30:35.529
[monitor beeping]

30:35.572 --> 30:37.444
Max's heart is racing
like a jackrabbit.

30:37.487 --> 30:38.662
We got to wake 'em up.

30:38.706 --> 30:39.881
You finish splicing
the alien virus

30:39.925 --> 30:41.143
to the steroids yet?

30:41.187 --> 30:42.449
Yeah, but I'd like
to test it first.

30:42.492 --> 30:43.842
No, there's no time.
Do it now.

30:46.540 --> 30:47.933
All right, hang tight, Liz.

30:47.976 --> 30:49.630
I'm sending in backup.

30:58.378 --> 30:59.640
[click]

31:07.430 --> 31:09.215
Move! Now!

31:14.220 --> 31:15.786
It's getting worse.

31:15.830 --> 31:17.353
I thought you weren't
interested.I wasn't,
