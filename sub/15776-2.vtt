WHAT'S GOING ON?

12:27.872 --> 12:28.873
[gasps]

12:28.956 --> 12:31.333
IT'S 47 MINUTES
PAST WAKE-UP TIME!

12:31.417 --> 12:32.543
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

12:33.878 --> 12:35.838

13:25.888 --> 13:27.640
"WE'RE OUT OF CLEAN GLASSES."

YOU'VE GOT A BIG STAIN.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.625
OH, THIS MIGHT REQUIRE
SOME CLUB SODA

13:54.708 --> 13:55.334
OR SOME POSITIVE ENERGY.

13:55.417 --> 13:57.127
- I'M FINE, MOM!

13:57.211 --> 13:58.546
I GOT TO GO!

14:06.512 --> 14:09.431

14:44.550 --> 14:46.468
WHAT IS GOING ON TODAY?

15:04.612 --> 15:05.321
[gasps]

15:05.404 --> 15:07.531
"HONEYBEES GONE
FIELD TRIPPIN'"?

15:07.615 --> 15:10.200
TODAY WAS THE FIELD TRIP!

15:10.284 --> 15:10.993
I MISSED THE--

15:19.710 --> 15:22.504
17 NAY VOTES AGAINST GOING

15:22.588 --> 15:23.714
TO THE ORIGINAL
MIRIAM BREEDLOVE'S LOG CABIN

15:23.797 --> 15:25.966
OF HOPE
AND OLD-FASHIONED LIVING,

15:26.050 --> 15:27.551
AND THEN I GET LEFT BEHIND?

15:27.635 --> 15:28.260
UGH!

15:28.344 --> 15:29.678
PEOPLE FORGET WHO LAMINATES

15:29.762 --> 15:30.262
THEIR PERMISSION SLIPS

15:32.431 --> 15:35.059
- HEY, HEY, HEY,
I LOVE THAT LOOK, MAN!

15:35.142 --> 15:37.269
I WENT THROUGH
THE TORTURED PHASE MYSELF.

15:37.353 --> 15:39.480
IT ROCKED!

15:39.563 --> 15:40.439
- UGH!

15:40.522 --> 15:41.565
THIS ISN'T A LOOK!

15:41.649 --> 15:44.360
THE WALL HIT MY FACE,
I GOT TOOTHPASTE IN MY EYE,

15:44.443 --> 15:46.028
STATIC ELECTRICITY IN MY HAIR,

15:46.111 --> 15:48.072
SPIDER WEBS AND ORANGE JUICE
ON MY UNIFORM,

15:48.155 --> 15:49.323
I STEPPED IN DOG POO,

15:49.406 --> 15:52.701

15:55.746 --> 15:56.538
- OH.

15:56.622 --> 15:58.415
LOOKS LIKE SOME BAD KARMA TO ME.

15:58.499 --> 15:59.416
- BAD KARMA?

15:59.500 --> 16:02.086
WHAT'S THAT?

16:02.169 --> 16:04.630
- YEAH, IT'S LIKE,
IF YOU'RE MEAN TO SOMEONE,

16:04.713 --> 16:06.799
BAD STUFF HAPPENS TO YOU.

16:06.882 --> 16:08.342
AND IF YOU'RE NICE,
IT LIKE, DOESN'T.

16:08.425 --> 16:09.301
- [growling]

16:09.385 --> 16:11.303
- KARMA!

16:11.387 --> 16:12.429
IT'S LIKE SCIENCE.

16:12.513 --> 16:13.722
- [growling]

16:13.806 --> 16:14.973
- KARMA.

16:15.057 --> 16:16.642
INTERESTING THEORY.

16:16.725 --> 16:18.727
BUT IT COULDN'T POSSIBLY
APPLY TO ME.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.604
IT IS MY POLICY TO EXTEND
KINDNESS AND COURTESY

16:20.688 --> 16:23.607
TO EVERYONE THAT I--
OH.

16:42.084 --> 16:43.752
- OH, HONEY,
YOU'VE GOT A BIG STAIN.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.587
OH, THIS MIGHT REQUIRE
CLUB SODA

16:45.671 --> 16:48.006
OR SOME POSITIVE ENERGY.

16:51.885 --> 16:52.970

OH, BEN, I DIDN'T MEAN
TO MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE

18:41.495 --> 18:43.163
