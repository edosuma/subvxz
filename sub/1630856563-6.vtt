weather clothes and my cold weather clothes.

00:34.577 --> 00:36.746
I have a light jacket, flak

00:36.746 --> 00:38.581
Wait. Does it rain in Heaven?

00:38.581 --> 00:40.708
Charlie, you're only going to
Heaven for a few hours.

00:40.708 --> 00:44.211
Vaggie, we are only going to
Heaven for a day.

00:44.211 --> 00:46.088
And I just want to be prepared!

00:46.088 --> 00:49.341
It's our last chance to convince
Heaven a soul can be redeemed.

00:49.341 --> 00:53.763
Yeah, I wish I could come,

And the answer is everyone.

I need to pass out.

Oho, you can sleep when you're
double dead, fuckhead!

That's my wall that
you just blew up.

It's so nice to
meet one of Angel's friends.

Aagh, he never brings
anyone around!

[Cherri Bomb snorts] Wonder why?

02:15.594 --> 02:17.513
Yeah, me too.

02:17.513 --> 02:20.349
Anyway, Angel and everyone else
have been working so hard.

02:20.349 --> 02:23.227
I think they deserve
to have a little fun.

02:23.435 --> 02:24.520
W-w-wait, they?

02:24.520 --> 02:25.938

Hi, everyone!

02:25.938 --> 02:27.857
Angel and his friend
are taking you all out

02:27.857 --> 02:30.568

Have you come to meet
your fate in battle, Cherri Bomb?

Apparently, I'm going out with Angel
and I got to drag your sorry asses along.

me are going out back for fun?

would ever happen.

in the right place?

Well, if you know so much.

09:40.372 --> 09:42.290
What do you think it takes
to get into Heaven?

09:42.290 --> 09:47.296
Ummm, w-w-well... Uhhhh.

09:47.296 --> 09:48.797
Is everything okay, Adam?

09:48.797 --> 09:50.007
Give me a fucking minute,
okay?

09:50.007 --> 09:54.845
[muttering]

09:55.762 --> 09:58.682
"Act selfless, don't steal,
stick it to the man."

09:58.682 --> 10:00.851
Are you fucking serious?

10:00.851 --> 10:03.603
Uh, yeah, sure got me here,
didn't it? [laughs]

10:03.979 --> 10:05.105
Right, Sera?

10:05.647 --> 10:07.649
He was the first human
soul in Heaven.

10:07.649 --> 10:10.736
Well, I bet Angel is doing
all of those things right now!

10:10.736 --> 10:12.988
Then let's fucking see it, brah!
[fingers snap]

10:12.988 --> 10:14.281
[wind howls]

10:15.907 --> 10:19.286
[Charlie] Your Honors,
may I present exhibit A.

10:19.286 --> 10:20.954
[nightclub music]

10:21.371 --> 10:23.707
[Cherri] Woo! Isn't this place the fucking best?

10:23.707 --> 10:26.960
[Husk] I'll admit, "Consent" is
a good name for a sex club.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.963
Niffty, dear, what
are you doing?

10:29.963 --> 10:33.258
I'm sweeping! Urgh, look how icky it is in here!

10:33.258 --> 10:35.719
That's because we're
at a club, dear.

10:35.719 --> 10:40.140
Oh! I thought the hotel looked
different! [giggles]

10:40.140 --> 10:43.352
Ms. Bomb,
I-I-I'd like to buy you a drink.

10:43.352 --> 10:45.687
Why? Didn't you say we're arch-rivals?

10:45.687 --> 10:50.192
Um... uh... because I'm buying
everyone a drink!

10:50.192 --> 10:53.195
[cheering] [Patron] Free drinks! I love alcohol!

10:53.862 --> 10:56.740
Good, I need a drink
after today.

10:56.740 --> 11:01.161
You know, Val, he's into this
waterboarding shit now,

11:01.161 --> 11:03.205
I don't know,
it's a kink.

11:03.205 --> 11:06.458
Angel, enough with the Val
talk. He already ruined your whole day.

11:06.458 --> 11:08.210
Don't let him ruin
your night, too.

11:08.877 --> 11:12.631
Here, take one of these and
you won't be worrying about nothing.

11:12.923 --> 11:14.716
Here we go.

11:14.716 --> 11:19.137
Oh, look, the drunk sobered up
long enough to judge us.

11:19.137 --> 11:20.889
I ain't the one trying
to get into Heaven.

11:21.223 --> 11:23.266
Look, you want to
fuck up all your progress?

11:23.266 --> 11:24.267
Be my guest.

11:24.810 --> 11:25.769
I just...
[sighs]

11:26.728 --> 11:27.896
I just thought you were
better than that.

11:28.230 --> 11:30.107
Thanks, Captain Buzzkill.

11:30.107 --> 11:33.777
Come on Angie, let's get fucked
up! It's been too long.

11:33.777 --> 11:35.737
I, uhh, I don't know,

11:35.737 --> 11:38.240
it's been a long night,
and I don't need to go too wild.

11:38.949 --> 11:40.075
Hmmm.

11:41.243 --> 11:43.495
Come on, bitch.

11:43.495 --> 11:46.957
If you've really been working
that hard, you deserve a little R and R...

11:46.957 --> 11:50.085
and some THC, or maybe
PCP with DMT.

11:50.085 --> 11:52.838
Aw fuck it, let's see
where the night takes us, huh?

11:52.838 --> 11:55.424
I... I guess.

11:55.424 --> 11:58.260
Cherri, I bought you a shot.

11:59.261 --> 12:03.098
B-because I bought everyone
another shot! Hooray! [laughs]

12:03.098 --> 12:06.393
[club goer] Yeah, another
drink! I love alcohol!

12:06.393 --> 12:10.730
[gulping]
Aah...fuck it, let's do it!

12:11.273 --> 12:12.691
[huffs]

12:14.192 --> 12:17.821
[Adam] Heavenly people,
what more do you need to see?

12:18.029 --> 12:21.074
The porn star chose a
night of debauchery.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.368
That's not a soul worthy
of being in Heaven!

12:23.368 --> 12:24.661
Um, objection!

12:26.121 --> 12:28.790
Are you really telling me
you've never had a drink with friends

12:28.790 --> 12:30.459
at the end of a hard day?

12:30.459 --> 12:32.294
Uh, we don't have hard days?

12:32.294 --> 12:34.421
It's fucking Heaven, bitch.

12:34.421 --> 12:37.799
You seriously going to sit there
and pretend like this behavior is okay?

12:37.799 --> 12:39.509
What do you think?

12:39.509 --> 12:42.471
I-- I-- I have to
go to the bathroom.

12:42.471 --> 12:44.097
What, Vaggie, can you hold it?!

12:44.097 --> 12:47.851
[groans]
Angel will make good decisions.

12:47.851 --> 12:49.728
[light ethereal music] Come
on, we have to keep watching.

12:50.812 --> 12:51.980
Please.

12:51.980 --> 12:53.482
[sighs]
Yeah. I don't know.

12:53.482 --> 12:55.275
[Emily] Yeah,
let's give him a chance.

12:57.068 --> 12:58.153
Very well.

12:58.361 --> 12:59.738
The court will allow it.

12:59.988 --> 13:01.031
[exclaims]
Fuck, yes!

13:02.199 --> 13:04.826
I mean, heh, thank you.

13:05.160 --> 13:07.078
[dance music plays]

13:07.078 --> 13:09.289
Round twelve, mother fuckers!

13:09.289 --> 13:11.333
Heels are coming off!

13:11.333 --> 13:13.919
[Angel]
Haha, Oh yeah, keep 'em comin'!

13:14.836 --> 13:16.838
Come on, right here,
right to Daddy.

13:16.838 --> 13:19.299
[Sir Pentious] Oh,
it's wonderful to have friends! [laughs]

13:19.299 --> 13:21.551
Everything's spinny, hehe.

13:21.551 --> 13:23.178
[Angel] Ha, I think
you're done, tiny.

13:23.178 --> 13:24.971
No! Gimme gimme gimme!

13:24.971 --> 13:27.098
Oh, come on, bitch,
she can handle a little more.

13:27.098 --> 13:29.559
She's like ten pounds
soaking wet, and--

13:29.559 --> 13:30.977
oh shit,
where'd she go?

13:30.977 --> 13:32.312
Hey, fuck!
[glasses smashing]

13:32.312 --> 13:33.313
Dirty, dirty, make it clean !

13:33.313 --> 13:34.981
Dammit, Niffty.

13:35.524 --> 13:38.860
Sorry fellas, here,
next one's on me.

13:39.110 --> 13:41.238
[fighting, arguing]

13:41.238 --> 13:42.197
Niffty?

13:42.531 --> 13:43.532
Shit!

13:44.032 --> 13:46.535
Chlorine... Bleach...

13:47.452 --> 13:49.204
Angie... the fuck are you
doing?

13:49.204 --> 13:52.540
You're supposed to be relaxing,
not playing nanny.

13:52.540 --> 13:54.543
Look, she ain't used
to this scene.

13:54.543 --> 13:57.546
I just don't want her to end up
in the gutter like I used to.

13:57.546 --> 13:59.172
Pfft, whatever, nerd.

13:59.381 --> 14:00.840
Just catch up when you're done.

14:01.091 --> 14:03.301
-[Niffty giggles]
-[Angel] Stop!

14:03.301 --> 14:04.928
You can't take that.

14:04.928 --> 14:07.389
God, Niff, why are you
bein' such a mess?!

14:07.931 --> 14:10.058
[sobs]
I'm the mess?

14:10.058 --> 14:13.228
[bawls]

14:13.228 --> 14:17.232
Oh, oh shit! Hey, hey, hey...
calm down, ya ain't a mess.

14:17.232 --> 14:22.153
It's fine... Ssshhh, hey,
you wanna play with the kitty?

14:22.487 --> 14:24.447
[bawling stops]

14:25.073 --> 14:26.157
[Niffty] Yeah.

14:27.075 --> 14:28.451
[Husk] The fuck is this?

14:28.451 --> 14:29.536
She's wasted.

14:29.536 --> 14:30.912
Just go with it.

14:31.079 --> 14:34.082
Re-really?! Ugh, get the--

14:34.583 --> 14:37.586
Ahhh, hey, wow!

14:38.211 --> 14:40.130
Hey, so...

14:40.547 --> 14:45.051
I see the club
has a sex room.

14:45.427 --> 14:50.265
So, I was thinking, maybe you'd
want to, uhm...

14:50.265 --> 14:54.311
do ... a sex with me?

14:54.311 --> 14:55.604
[snort]

14:55.604 --> 14:57.230
I'm sorry, why would
we have sex?

14:57.230 --> 15:00.066
Uh... uh... Um...

15:00.066 --> 15:03.528
because I'm
having sex with everyone here!

15:03.528 --> 15:04.487
[cheering]

15:04.487 --> 15:05.989
[Pentious] Wait.

15:05.989 --> 15:07.949
-Get in here.

15:07.949 --> 15:09.701
[door slams]

15:09.701 --> 15:12.162
You know, we can do this
fucking shit every fucking night.

15:12.162 --> 15:13.622
You don't have to spend
all your off hours

15:13.622 --> 15:16.041
"working on yourself,"
you little bitch.

15:16.041 --> 15:18.627
The hotel isn't a problem in his
life, it's--

15:18.627 --> 15:20.253
[Angel] Valentino.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.338
Exactly.

15:21.338 --> 15:22.339
So why don't you--

15:22.339 --> 15:24.299
No... Valentino.

15:24.299 --> 15:26.217
Yeah, I'm here all the time,
they know me.

15:27.052 --> 15:29.471
You're gorgeous... do you
need a job?

15:30.138 --> 15:31.431
How many dicks
can you suck?

15:31.431 --> 15:33.058
[Valentino] Ooh, I could
make you a star.

15:33.058 --> 15:34.267
[Angel] Let's get the
fuck outta here. Ok.

15:34.267 --> 15:35.226
-Come on--
-[Valentino] Yeah, a star.

15:35.226 --> 15:36.186
Where's Niffty?

15:36.186 --> 15:37.646
[Valentino] Porn star.

15:37.646 --> 15:38.313
Okay, yup,
bring me another drink

15:38.313 --> 15:38.980
or I'll
fucking kill you.

15:38.980 --> 15:39.898
[Nifty] Bad boy. Hehehehe.

15:39.898 --> 15:41.566
[Valentino] I said I'll
fucking kill you!

15:41.566 --> 15:42.400
Excuse me.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.568
-Pardon me.
-[Valentino] And I will.

15:43.568 --> 15:45.737
Get out of my way.

15:45.737 --> 15:48.281
[Valentino] Holy
shit, Angel Dust?

15:48.281 --> 15:50.158
What are you doing here, baby?

15:50.158 --> 15:52.494
You didn't get enough
dick today?

15:52.494 --> 15:53.578
Funny.

15:53.578 --> 15:55.163
Who's this chiquita?

15:55.163 --> 15:57.332
You bringing me fresh meat?

15:57.540 --> 15:58.750
[Valentino] Oi!

15:58.750 --> 16:01.002
I just want a taste.

16:01.002 --> 16:04.339
Ehh, weird, but there's
a kink for that, I'm sure!

16:04.339 --> 16:05.590
[Angel] Fuck off, Val.

16:05.590 --> 16:06.633
Excuse me?

16:06.633 --> 16:08.343
I said fuck off!

16:08.551 --> 16:10.512
I may have to put up
with your bullshit,

16:10.512 --> 16:12.639
but you ain't fucking
with any of my friends.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.391
You forget who you're
talking to?

16:15.016 --> 16:16.601
I own you, bitch.

16:18.103 --> 16:21.106
Yeah, you do, in the studio,

16:21.106 --> 16:23.191
and you can do anything
you want to me there,

16:23.191 --> 16:25.026
just like our deal says.

16:25.026 --> 16:27.779
But out here, I get
to do what I want.

16:27.779 --> 16:29.280
So once again,

16:29.280 --> 16:30.990
fuck off!

16:32.409 --> 16:34.369
-[Angel coughs and splutters]
-Enjoy the rest of your night, bitch,

16:34.369 --> 16:36.371
-[Angel breathes deeply]
-[Valentino] because I'm going to enjoy

16:36.371 --> 16:38.373
making you pay for it tomorrow.

16:38.748 --> 16:41.626
-[sinister music]
-[Cherri] Fucking dickhead.

16:42.085 --> 16:43.294
Fuck it.

16:43.294 --> 16:44.379
It was worth it.

16:44.587 --> 16:45.714
[Husk]
Way to go, kid.

16:46.715 --> 16:48.216
Ow!
What the fuck?!

16:48.216 --> 16:51.428
[Niffty chuckles]
For my collection. Hehe.

16:52.053 --> 16:53.054
Wait up, guys!

16:54.013 --> 16:55.724
Did you just call
these cunts your friends?

16:55.724 --> 16:57.100
Thought that was my job.

16:57.100 --> 16:58.643
There's room for everyone,

16:59.060 --> 17:00.061
[emotive music]
and ya know...

17:00.437 --> 17:02.230
you could come crash
with us too.

17:02.230 --> 17:04.065
Okay, look, Angie,

17:04.065 --> 17:06.568
I'm glad this
hotel shit is workin' for you,

17:06.568 --> 17:08.444
but you know me, bitch,

17:08.444 --> 17:10.405
I'm doin' just fine.

17:10.405 --> 17:13.241
In fact, I'm gonna fuck the
next guy I see, okay?

17:13.782 --> 17:16.243
But, if you need me,

17:16.243 --> 17:17.662
you know where to find me, yeah?

Dammit!

17:26.087 --> 17:29.716
[Charlie] See! He did
everything on your checklist!

17:29.716 --> 17:30.842
He was selfless,

17:30.842 --> 17:32.552
he stopped Nifty from stealing,

17:32.552 --> 17:35.346
and he stuck it to
that moth man!

17:35.346 --> 17:37.599
[Adam] Uhhh... Well, uh...

17:37.599 --> 17:40.226
Then, then why
isn't he here then? Hm?

17:40.226 --> 17:43.104
Yeah, why isn't he here?

stops now.

We know when a soul arrives.

We know when they pass
