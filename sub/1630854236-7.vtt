00:11.551 --> 00:13.793
<i>At the tone,
please leave your message.</i>

00:15.034 --> 00:17.586
Hey, William. It's Abby.

00:17.689 --> 00:21.206
I'm not sure why
I thought you would pick up

00:21.310 --> 00:23.896
this Thanksgiving, but...

00:24.000 --> 00:25.448
Well, I just--

00:25.551 --> 00:28.275
you know, if you're hungry,
or you want to talk...

00:29.793 --> 00:31.724
I'm here. So...

00:32.965 --> 00:34.689
Okay, bye.

00:46.034 --> 00:48.034
It's just owl hooters
and roost trees?

00:48.137 --> 00:49.379
Yeah, they're critical
for a hunt, sure.

00:49.482 --> 00:51.586
But we're behind
on schedule already.

00:51.689 --> 00:55.413
Have faith, Liam. Have faith.

00:55.517 --> 00:57.103
Well, I thought I'd be
walking into

00:57.206 --> 00:58.379
the middle of
Turkey glaze prep.

00:58.482 --> 01:00.206
Not whatever this is.

01:00.310 --> 01:02.689
Well, you are not
too far off, Mama.

01:02.793 --> 01:06.068
Just doing a little something
different this year.

01:06.172 --> 01:08.275
- We are starting
a new tradition.
- Yeah.

01:08.379 --> 01:11.241
One that Cordi calls
"ranch to table turkey."

01:11.344 --> 01:14.034
Yeah. Instead of farm to table,
you know...

01:14.137 --> 01:15.896
Farm to table...

01:16.000 --> 01:17.448
Daddy-- So, anyways, Mama,

01:17.551 --> 01:19.241
this year, it's gonna start
with a hunt.

01:19.344 --> 01:20.724
You know, Stella Blue
always said

01:20.827 --> 01:22.862
she wanted to mix things up
on Thanksgiving.

01:22.965 --> 01:26.000
So, I'm gonna send some
progress pics to our group chat.

01:26.103 --> 01:28.862
Cook up a little bit of FOMO,
and before sealing the deal

01:28.965 --> 01:30.275
with a Baked Alaska.

01:30.379 --> 01:32.241
So, a turkey hunt

01:32.344 --> 01:34.137
on top of
Stella's favorite dessert.

01:34.241 --> 01:36.241
- Yes, sir.
- I see what you're doing, son.

01:36.344 --> 01:38.448
Yeah, that's a lot of
big gestures

01:38.551 --> 01:40.724
to avoid some
uncomfortable conversations.

01:40.827 --> 01:43.655
Or... just trying to guarantee
her attendance.

01:43.758 --> 01:45.620
You know, it's been too many
weeks of radio silence

01:45.724 --> 01:48.034
since her...

01:48.137 --> 01:50.448
since her recent relocation.

01:50.551 --> 01:54.689
I know. And I'm glad that
you're looking to mend things.

01:54.793 --> 01:57.137
But maybe
a pumpkin pie would suffice?

01:57.241 --> 01:58.827
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:58.931 --> 02:01.206
I think someone here
is trying to break tradition

02:01.310 --> 02:03.172
and get involved
with the menu.

02:03.275 --> 02:06.275
So, you're the only one allowed
to change things up around here?

02:06.379 --> 02:09.103
Hey, no, no, no.
That tradition is important.

02:09.206 --> 02:11.344
We love you, Mama.

02:11.448 --> 02:12.896
But you're not lifting
a finger today.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.931
Everything will be ready
by Circle of Thanks.

02:15.034 --> 02:16.827
I promise. Hey,
what does Daddy always say?

02:16.931 --> 02:19.896
"Ah, hell.
Full bellies and a full table."

02:20.000 --> 02:22.689
"Yeah, that's what the day's
all about, you hear?"

02:22.793 --> 02:25.137
My goodness, these are
knuckleheads, that's all.

02:25.241 --> 02:26.793
Knuckleheads.

02:26.896 --> 02:28.931
Hey, the table will be full, Mama.

02:29.034 --> 02:33.482
All right.
So, who's ready to bag a bird?

02:34.448 --> 02:35.931
<i>♪ Well, the law come around♪</i>

02:36.034 --> 02:37.344
<i>♪ Started laying on
the cuffs...♪</i>

02:40.620 --> 02:43.000
<i>♪ But when you ain't so lucky♪</i>

02:43.103 --> 02:44.758
<i>♪ Lucky as hell...♪</i>

02:46.793 --> 02:50.137
<i>♪ And I get down,
on your feet...♪</i>

02:52.482 --> 02:56.689
I'm still the big brother!

03:05.275 --> 03:07.862
Move aside, boys.
Here comes Daddy!

03:07.965 --> 03:10.793
- Eat my dust-- Whoa!
- Yeah!

03:12.034 --> 03:14.896
Look out, knuckleheads!

03:25.241 --> 03:26.931
Shh, shh, shh.

03:35.827 --> 03:37.413
Ah, nil.

03:38.827 --> 03:40.620
I was kinda hoping that
a Texas Ranger might be,

03:40.724 --> 03:42.724
I don't know,
a better marksman.

03:42.827 --> 03:45.206
All right, well,
y'all moving around,

03:45.310 --> 03:47.931
making all that noise, you
probably scared them off...

03:48.034 --> 03:51.206
Okay, so-- so--

03:51.310 --> 03:52.931
We can't come back
empty handed.

03:53.034 --> 03:55.241
How much more hunting time
do we have budgeted?

03:55.344 --> 03:57.241
Is someone having
buyer's remorse?

03:57.344 --> 03:59.241
No, no, I just--

03:59.344 --> 04:01.586
These gobblers are crafty.

04:01.689 --> 04:03.448
Hey, I've been meaning
to talk to you

04:03.551 --> 04:04.689
about Circle of Thanks

04:04.793 --> 04:06.655
- actually--
- You prepped Ben?

04:06.758 --> 04:08.241
I mean, all I told him was

04:08.344 --> 04:09.793
to be here at noon
but that's not it.

04:09.896 --> 04:11.310
Because there hasn't
really been an opening.

04:11.413 --> 04:13.517
Why would that need
an opening?

04:13.620 --> 04:15.620
I mean, you guys are pretty
solid, right?

04:15.724 --> 04:17.103
Yeah, yes, I just really want

04:17.206 --> 04:18.793
this Thanksgiving
to be special,

04:18.896 --> 04:20.896
and I was thinking about
grand gestures,

04:21.000 --> 04:22.620
and I know that there are

04:22.724 --> 04:24.413
Circle of Thanks Rules
to adhere to...

04:24.517 --> 04:27.068
Ah! You're seeking

04:27.172 --> 04:29.103
a significant other exemption,
aren't you?

04:29.206 --> 04:31.551
All right, all right, well,
you know what, little bro,

04:31.655 --> 04:32.758
I've got your back.

04:32.862 --> 04:35.517
Circle of Thanks exemption...

04:35.620 --> 04:37.482
- granted.
- Yes, thank you.

04:37.586 --> 04:40.827
Well, it's a good thing
that you two are better

04:40.931 --> 04:42.724
at scheming
than you are shooting

04:42.827 --> 04:44.862
because we've got squadoosh.

04:44.965 --> 04:46.241
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:46.344 --> 04:47.965
So, what should we do?

04:48.068 --> 04:50.931
I mean, it's not really
a turkey day without a turkey.

04:51.034 --> 04:55.482
Please. I knew this whole
expedition was a pipe dream.

04:55.586 --> 04:58.344
I bought one
at the market a week ago.

04:59.344 --> 05:00.758
- Let's go.
- All right, yeah.

05:00.862 --> 05:03.275
All right, but this stays
between the three of us!

05:03.379 --> 05:05.896
We got one fresh this morning.
It was awesome.

05:14.586 --> 05:16.793
Oh, come on.

05:16.896 --> 05:19.379
Look, I don't even know
what we're debating here.

05:19.482 --> 05:21.620
Okay?
85 inches at that price?

05:21.724 --> 05:23.827
It's doorbusters territory.

05:23.931 --> 05:26.655
- That's what
they want you to think.
- Nope. No.

05:26.758 --> 05:30.241
Not that.
I've heard that argument before.

05:30.344 --> 05:32.620
Oh, you aren't seriously--

05:32.724 --> 05:33.758
00 a.m. breakfast sandwich?

05:33.862 --> 05:35.551
- Sure am.
- I was hungry

05:35.655 --> 05:37.448
and the bacon
was applewood smoked.

05:38.482 --> 05:39.965
Fine, it was a rookie mistake.

05:40.068 --> 05:42.379
No one is saying that
I didn't blow a hole

05:42.482 --> 05:43.862
through our shopping schedule
that year.

05:43.965 --> 05:45.931
We got cocky.
We got preoccupied.

05:46.034 --> 05:48.068
- And what happens
when that happens?
- You pay full price.

05:48.172 --> 05:50.620
But that will not be
our fate this year.

05:50.724 --> 05:52.724
We will be
at the mall at 7:00 p.m.

05:52.827 --> 05:55.862
We will be in line
for 8:00 p.m. doorbusters.

05:55.965 --> 05:58.379
We will secure
the doorbusters.

05:58.482 --> 06:00.758
And then, by tomorrow,
bacon be damned,

06:00.862 --> 06:02.758
we will be chilling
under the heat

06:02.862 --> 06:05.586
- of 85 inches of 120 hertz.
- Ah...

06:05.689 --> 06:07.655
- Jingle all the way, baby.
- Yeah!

06:07.758 --> 06:09.172
- Yes!
- There they are!

06:09.275 --> 06:11.344
- Hey!
Happy Thanksgiving!
- Hey!

06:11.448 --> 06:15.034
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Hi, hi. Happy thanksgiving.

06:15.137 --> 06:16.448
Glad we could stop by.

06:16.551 --> 06:18.448
You guys are gonna love
turkey day here.

06:18.551 --> 06:21.103
Dad's already got the cranberry
old fashions flowing.

06:21.206 --> 06:23.965
The Lions game is on earlier
and then it's the Cowboys.

06:24.068 --> 06:26.413
Cordi says that dinner
is gonna be at 7:00

06:26.517 --> 06:29.068
but let's be honest,
it's always, like, around 9:00.

06:29.172 --> 06:31.758
And we do this thing,
between dinner and dessert,

06:31.862 --> 06:34.724
called the Circle of Thanks.
It's really great.

06:34.827 --> 06:37.206
Wow, babe, I didn't know
you had such a big day planned.

06:37.310 --> 06:39.379
Did you say dinner at 9:00?

06:39.482 --> 06:41.517
I thought this was more of
an eat upon arrival thing.

06:41.620 --> 06:44.931
No. Dinner start time's kind of
been a debate over the years.

06:45.034 --> 06:46.620
But...

06:46.724 --> 06:48.793
it's a full day
of fun over here.

06:48.896 --> 06:51.413
Yeah, it is!

06:51.517 --> 06:53.655
We're gonna need
an exit strategy.

06:53.758 --> 06:54.793
- Uh-huh. Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

06:54.896 --> 06:56.137
- Come on!
- Oh!

07:01.862 --> 07:04.517
172 for the
Downtown Women's Shelter.

07:04.620 --> 07:05.724
We're pushing records this year.

07:05.827 --> 07:06.793
Glad I could help out.

07:06.896 --> 07:08.448
Now we just need to survive

07:08.551 --> 07:10.241
- the NFL games, and--
- Seriously,

07:10.344 --> 07:12.034
why are people
so sloppy on Thanksgiving?

07:12.137 --> 07:13.758
Have you decided
what you want to do

07:13.862 --> 07:15.310
after we close up?

07:15.413 --> 07:16.965
Maybe make
two more of these

07:17.068 --> 07:19.827
for our first romantic
Thanksgiving together?

07:21.896 --> 07:25.103
Well, I guess it's that
or giving into bribery.

07:26.379 --> 07:28.034
I'm sorry, what?

07:28.137 --> 07:31.206
My dad is trying to butter me up
on this group chat.

07:31.310 --> 07:34.551
Like I can't see through that.
Baked Alaska and turkey hunts?

07:34.655 --> 07:36.137
He thinks it's gonna force
my hand

07:36.241 --> 07:38.172
to show up and apologize.

07:38.275 --> 07:41.793
I mean, I have heard
Baked Alaska is delicious, so...

07:43.034 --> 07:45.103
Whose side are you on here?

07:46.000 --> 07:49.482
Whichever side
you tell me to be? Yeah?

07:49.586 --> 07:51.482
That is the right answer.

07:51.586 --> 07:53.655
Okay.

07:53.758 --> 07:55.068
I just can't believe

07:55.172 --> 07:57.034
August still hasn't straightened
this out.

07:57.137 --> 07:59.517
Oh, please. That party is
so far in his rearview.

07:59.620 --> 08:01.310
Hell of a dodge.

08:01.413 --> 08:03.344
And my dad is completely blind

08:03.448 --> 08:07.551
to who August is becoming
on his social ascent.

08:07.655 --> 08:11.310
Yeah.

08:11.413 --> 08:12.758
Hey, this is my mom and dad.

08:12.862 --> 08:14.379
I gotta take this,
they're on their cruise.

08:14.482 --> 08:17.034
- I'll be right back.
- Okay, I'll get this loaded up.

08:17.137 --> 08:19.758
Okay. Hello?

08:19.862 --> 08:22.000
Hey, happy Thanksgiving
to you, too.

08:30.931 --> 08:33.655
Colton. Can you come here?
It's important.

08:33.758 --> 08:36.724
Hey, I'll call you back. Sorry.

08:36.827 --> 08:37.896
What's wrong?

08:38.000 --> 08:40.034
August's stupid party.

08:40.137 --> 08:41.793
What?

08:41.896 --> 08:44.275
The city just
shut down The Side Step.

08:46.344 --> 08:48.068
Well, happy Thanksgiving.

08:54.448 --> 08:55.896
- Got that?
- Yeah, got it.

08:58.586 --> 09:03.517
<i>♪ Baby, baby, time's a wasting♪</i>

09:03.620 --> 09:06.103
Voilà, perfect!

09:06.965 --> 09:08.206
- Yeah, that's great.
- Yeah?

09:08.310 --> 09:09.965
Can I get some more celery?

09:10.068 --> 09:11.275
Thanks.

09:11.379 --> 09:14.965
Pretend you're working.

09:15.068 --> 09:17.137
<i>♪ I'm advocating...♪</i>

09:17.241 --> 09:20.758
Hey, Augie, the ice cream
needs to remain frozen,

09:20.862 --> 09:24.655
so let's hustle.
And the mar-ring-ga...

09:24.758 --> 09:25.758
It's pronounced, "meringue."

09:25.862 --> 09:27.551
- Meringue.
- Meringue. Okay.

09:27.655 --> 09:29.689
Meringue, of course.
Sorry, Chef.

09:29.793 --> 09:31.206
Augie, you getting all this?

09:31.310 --> 09:33.068
Yeah, no, it's like
making fancy ice cream.

09:33.172 --> 09:36.137
No, it is not fancy ice cream,
it is Baked Alaska.

09:36.241 --> 09:38.620
It cannot be made.
It has to be built.

09:38.724 --> 09:40.241
Okay, "Chef."

09:40.344 --> 09:43.275
Hey, why you talking
to your uncle that way?

09:43.379 --> 09:47.034
- Hey, anything I can do to help?
- Ben!

09:47.137 --> 09:49.724
You-- you can go back
into the living room

09:49.827 --> 09:52.068
and relax,
and look at the televisions

09:52.172 --> 09:54.482
and whatever for tomorrow,
for Black Friday.

09:54.586 --> 09:57.103
Yeah.
About that...

09:57.206 --> 09:59.586
I think we got
our wires crossed.

09:59.689 --> 10:03.241
Cass and I kinda do
Black Friday on Thanksgiving.

10:03.344 --> 10:06.068
Like it starts tonight.
At the mall. In person.

10:06.172 --> 10:10.034
That's our family tradition
and I thought

10:10.137 --> 10:12.931
this was more of an
early dinner than--

10:13.034 --> 10:14.310
You gotta leave early?
That's fine.

10:14.413 --> 10:15.413
How about this,

10:15.517 --> 10:16.724
we'll do Circle of Thanks

10:16.827 --> 10:17.931
and dinner
at the same time.

10:18.034 --> 10:20.000
- Everyone wins. Awesome.
- Yeah.

10:20.103 --> 10:22.310
You two are really cooking up
something special

10:22.413 --> 10:25.068
- for this dinner.
- And it's not
just mashed potatoes.

10:25.172 --> 10:29.000
I guess we can stick around
for dinner, if we eat quickly.

10:29.103 --> 10:31.310
- Soon as possible.
- I'll tell Cass.

10:31.413 --> 10:33.448
Great.

10:33.551 --> 10:35.206
-"And it's not
just mashed potatoes"?
- Yeah.

10:35.310 --> 10:37.275
- I don't talk like that.
- Okay, I know.

10:37.379 --> 10:38.965
- Hey, I know, shh, shh.
- I don't know why
I'm being like this...

10:39.068 --> 10:41.172
Hey, shake it off.
Stinker. All right?

10:41.275 --> 10:43.310
- Yeah.
- You got this.

10:43.413 --> 10:47.793
Thanks.
Any word from Stella or...

10:47.896 --> 10:51.689
Um, radio silence.

10:51.793 --> 10:53.310
Third time calling

10:53.413 --> 10:55.241
and still no answer
from Aunt Geri.

10:55.344 --> 10:58.241
I honestly thought
we were in the clear after--

10:58.344 --> 11:00.862
- It's been weeks.
- I can't believe I'm saying this

11:00.965 --> 11:02.517
but I think
we need to go back to the ranch.

11:02.620 --> 11:04.827
No, I am not taking
the heat for this, too.

11:04.931 --> 11:06.517
That's not what I'm pitching.

11:06.620 --> 11:08.965
Someone needs to let your dad
know the bar got shut down.

11:09.068 --> 11:11.310
And don't you think
that should be Augie?

11:13.344 --> 11:15.137
He does think
he got away with it.

11:15.241 --> 11:18.034
August epically threw you
under the bus with this party.

11:18.137 --> 11:22.000
And from where I'm sitting,
your dad chose him over you.

11:22.965 --> 11:24.827
If you really wanna handle
this situation,

11:24.931 --> 11:26.379
I say we drop this grenade

11:26.482 --> 11:28.206
on their Thanksgiving dinner
and bounce.

11:28.310 --> 11:31.275
Make August clean up
the mess for once.

11:34.827 --> 11:36.241
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

11:37.068 --> 11:39.620
Okay.

11:40.862 --> 11:42.379
Oh, no! Well, hell,

11:42.482 --> 11:44.275
I can't watch
this nonsense anymore.

11:44.379 --> 11:46.724
These corners can't cover
a wall with paint.

11:46.827 --> 11:48.448
They're ranked 30th
in pass defense.

11:48.551 --> 11:51.103
Oh, please don't get him going
on the Dallas Cowboys.

11:51.206 --> 11:52.758
Oh, I'm just fine
with all that

11:52.862 --> 11:54.620
on my own, thank you.

11:54.724 --> 11:57.103
- I'll be back.
- All right.

11:59.379 --> 12:01.689
Are you still
on the Black Friday grind?

12:01.793 --> 12:03.344
Actually...

12:06.275 --> 12:08.068
- No way.
- Mm-hmm.

12:08.172 --> 12:10.448
- You and my man Kev?
- Calm down.

12:10.551 --> 12:11.586
We're just texting.

12:12.655 --> 12:16.517
He may not be the grotesque
stereotype I thought he was.

12:16.620 --> 12:17.931
He just got back
from a week

12:18.034 --> 12:19.413
backpacking in Acadia.

12:19.517 --> 12:21.793
And you think
that's kind of cool?

12:21.896 --> 12:23.827
In a "hand holding" kind of way.

12:23.931 --> 12:26.379
- No.
- Invite him over for dinner.

12:26.482 --> 12:28.103
He can have my spot.

12:28.206 --> 12:30.931
Cap has the rookies working
the holiday shifts at HQ.

12:31.034 --> 12:34.206
So I'm T-minus two hours
from a TV dinner anyways.

12:34.310 --> 12:37.000
- Do you want me to come with?
- I'm good.

12:37.103 --> 12:39.103
Besides you have
somebody texting down your door.

12:39.206 --> 12:41.724
Yeah, sure.
But inviting him here?

12:41.827 --> 12:43.620
For this? As a first date?

12:43.724 --> 12:45.413
That-- no, that feels crazy.

12:45.517 --> 12:48.896
That is crazy,
but it's also very much you.

12:49.689 --> 12:51.206
- Oh, you're right.
- Yeah.

12:51.310 --> 12:52.413
Damn it.

12:53.517 --> 12:54.827
All right, I'm gonna need

12:54.931 --> 12:56.586
another cranberry
old fashioned, Trey.

12:56.689 --> 12:58.724
Okay. All right.

12:58.827 --> 13:00.172
You're making a mess.

13:00.275 --> 13:02.068
I'm making a mess?
You're making--

13:02.172 --> 13:03.448
- Hey!
- Hey, hey.

13:03.551 --> 13:05.172
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:06.137 --> 13:07.068
Crap. He said yes.

13:07.172 --> 13:08.896
He said what? Who said--

13:09.000 --> 13:10.517
Gonna need more info.

13:10.620 --> 13:11.965
- That plus-one you offered...
- Yeah.

13:12.068 --> 13:13.655
...it might be a date.

13:13.758 --> 13:14.965
That guy Kevin.

13:15.068 --> 13:16.586
The mayor's
Chief of Staff Kevin?

13:16.689 --> 13:18.344
Oh, yeah, yeah.
You might want one of these.

13:18.448 --> 13:20.034
You want one of those?

13:20.137 --> 13:22.103
Just saying. All right,
the more the merrier.

13:22.206 --> 13:23.862
This already
feels like a mistake.

13:23.965 --> 13:25.448
How did he nab the invite?

13:25.551 --> 13:27.793
He nabbed the invite
because Cassie here

13:27.896 --> 13:29.379
is focusing more
on her work-life balance.

13:29.482 --> 13:31.482
Well, I am capable of
answering for myself, Walker.

13:31.586 --> 13:33.586
- But yeah, what he said.
- I'm late.

13:33.689 --> 13:35.137
I know. I'm sorry.

13:37.379 --> 13:40.034
An endless barrage of
calls from the D.A.'s office.

13:40.137 --> 13:42.241
Makes me wish we
still had you over there, Liam.

13:42.344 --> 13:44.206
It must be pretty bad
if you're wishing that.

13:44.310 --> 13:46.103
But it's nice to know that

13:46.206 --> 13:47.862
whoever took us
is being prosecuted.

13:47.965 --> 13:50.172
Well, that's not exactly
Thanksgiving talk.

13:50.275 --> 13:52.000
Right? Thus
my D.A.'s office headaches.

13:52.103 --> 13:53.724
And this suit. Forgive me.

13:53.827 --> 13:55.275
Y'all know how I prefer robust

13:55.379 --> 13:57.034
holiday attire
for such occasions.

13:57.137 --> 14:00.379
Grey Flag had other plans
for your wardrobe, I guess.

14:00.482 --> 14:03.655
Sorry.

14:04.413 --> 14:09.448
Uh, but you're here now,
and that's what matters most.

14:09.551 --> 14:12.206
And I hear we might be having
food at some point?

14:12.310 --> 14:14.655
Yeah, yeah.
It's on the way.

14:14.758 --> 14:16.103
I brought my appetite.

14:16.206 --> 14:17.724
I'm gonna say hi
to the folks.

14:17.827 --> 14:18.965
All right, Cap.

14:19.068 --> 14:20.379
Speed that process up.
I'm hungry.

14:20.482 --> 14:22.206
Yeah, yeah.
Do you want some cornbread?

14:34.827 --> 14:36.482
- Hey, Cass.
- Yeah.

14:36.586 --> 14:39.068
- Uh-- help, please?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

14:39.172 --> 14:41.103
Please, go. Go help him.

14:44.517 --> 14:46.241
Okay, what you need?

14:46.344 --> 14:47.862
Yeah.

14:47.965 --> 14:49.448
Oh, my gosh,
your commitment

14:49.551 --> 14:52.000
to a themed meal
is truly undefeated.

14:52.103 --> 14:53.931
Well,
all out for Mama today.

14:54.034 --> 14:55.241
It's a tough day.

14:55.344 --> 14:56.724
Hey...

14:56.827 --> 14:57.827
What the hell was that earlier?

14:57.931 --> 14:59.172
With James. Grey Flag?

14:59.275 --> 15:01.482
That's a name we do not know, remember?

15:01.586 --> 15:03.241
I cleaned it up.

15:04.482 --> 15:05.275
Maybe.

15:10.206 --> 15:13.517
Hopefully.

15:14.448 --> 15:16.482
It just fell out, okay?

15:17.379 --> 15:18.862
But it's not like
James knows

15:18.965 --> 15:20.275
what was in
that evidence transport.

15:20.379 --> 15:22.310
We don't know what James knows
or doesn't know.

15:22.413 --> 15:26.000
We stick to our story.
The evidence bags stayed closed.

15:26.103 --> 15:27.379
They never left our custody.

15:27.482 --> 15:29.379
The evidence
was not tampered with.

15:30.724 --> 15:31.931
A whole lot of mess
for nothing.

15:33.620 --> 15:35.862
Yeah, right.
Whole lot of mess for nothing.

15:35.965 --> 15:37.517
Good.

15:46.551 --> 15:48.034
It doesn't work like that.

15:48.137 --> 15:51.310
Hey, you're heading to HQ early?

15:51.413 --> 15:52.758
Yes, sir.

15:52.862 --> 15:54.862
Storm's picking up.

15:54.965 --> 15:57.137
So, I don't wanna miss
my shift,

15:57.241 --> 16:00.827
my boss is kind of a hard ass.

16:00.931 --> 16:04.137
Hey, unless you wanna sub in
for your favorite Ranger?

16:04.241 --> 16:05.965
Oh, no, no.

16:06.068 --> 16:07.931
I gotta talk to Walker
and Cassie about something...

16:08.034 --> 16:09.827
Hey, I had to try.

16:09.931 --> 16:12.172
- Happy Thanksgiving, Cap.
- Happy Thanksgiving, rook.

16:12.275 --> 16:13.517
- Be safe, all right?
- Okay, you too.

16:13.620 --> 16:15.482
Happy Thanksgiving, everybody.

16:15.586 --> 16:17.344
- Happy Thanksgiving!
- Happy Thanksgiving.

16:17.448 --> 16:19.034
- Thanks for coming.
- Thank you.

16:19.137 --> 16:20.896
- Drive safe, Trey.
- Will do.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.758
We'll see you later.

16:22.862 --> 16:25.000
- Careful
over there, Bonham.
- I know what I'm doing.

16:25.103 --> 16:26.965
- Hello!
- Oh.

16:27.068 --> 16:28.931
- Hi!
- Hey!

16:29.034 --> 16:32.344
I'm so glad
that you made it.

16:34.965 --> 16:37.034
There she is.

16:37.137 --> 16:38.620
Oh, my goodness-- well,
I guess you heard

16:38.724 --> 16:40.448
about this
Baked Alaska business, huh?

16:40.551 --> 16:42.793
Colton, it's a coin flip
from being a disaster.

16:42.896 --> 16:44.827
Stella Blue! Stella Blue!

16:44.931 --> 16:46.689
I knew you'd come. There she is.

16:46.793 --> 16:48.620
Hey, hey.

16:48.724 --> 16:52.275
I knew you'd be here. Colton.

16:52.379 --> 16:54.068
Happy turkey day.
Happy Thanksgiving.

16:54.172 --> 16:55.413
Stella, baby,

16:55.517 --> 16:58.482
I'm knee deep
in it in the kitchen.

16:58.586 --> 17:00.896
What do you say we finish
the Baked Alaska together?

17:01.000 --> 17:02.482
We could-- we can catch up?

17:02.586 --> 17:05.206
I'd love
to hear about things and...

17:05.310 --> 17:08.137
Yeah, that's not really
why I'm here.

17:08.241 --> 17:09.827
Where's August?

17:09.931 --> 17:11.344
He must be in his room.

17:11.448 --> 17:14.965
Or your room,
he's sleeping there now.

17:15.068 --> 17:17.241
Since you're, you know...

17:17.344 --> 17:19.172
lodging elsewhere and all that.

17:20.689 --> 17:22.206
Okay, well, we just gotta talk

17:22.310 --> 17:24.724
and then I'll be going, so...

17:51.827 --> 17:53.137
Take a breath.

18:05.103 --> 18:06.551
Cordell.

18:06.655 --> 18:09.241
You think a lot of
this squabble

18:09.344 --> 18:10.620
is on your daughter.

18:12.379 --> 18:15.172
Well, uh, how else
would you describe it?

18:15.275 --> 18:17.172
That August is
a lot more mixed up in it

18:17.275 --> 18:19.689
than I reckon
you'd care to admit.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.068
Look. I'm--

18:25.172 --> 18:27.241
I'm not one to get involved
in how you handle yours.

18:27.344 --> 18:28.827
I leave that
up to your mother.

18:28.931 --> 18:33.310
But since you've had
your crosshairs over Stella...

18:34.551 --> 18:36.379
...you opened yourself up
to a blind spot.

18:36.482 --> 18:38.137
Daddy, respectfully,

18:38.241 --> 18:42.482
August isn't the one moving out
without saying goodbye.

18:43.413 --> 18:46.137
August isn't the one
skipping college

18:46.241 --> 18:48.344
to throw ragers
at The Side Step.

18:48.448 --> 18:51.655
August isn't the one
who lied to me all summer.

18:51.758 --> 18:54.000
He did have a hand in
all those things, Cordell.

18:54.103 --> 18:56.586
Sure. Following
in his big sister's footsteps.

18:56.689 --> 18:58.758
But August is the steady one.

18:58.862 --> 19:02.000
August is solid.
It's been that way forever.

19:02.103 --> 19:05.275
Don't look now, but I think
they call those blinders.

19:14.206 --> 19:16.758
Oh, well, hell's bells.
Now what?

19:22.379 --> 19:23.482
Have you tried the breakers?

19:23.586 --> 19:25.241
Uh, yeah.

19:25.344 --> 19:26.793
Oh, and we lost the stove.

19:34.965 --> 19:36.793
Oh, no!

19:36.896 --> 19:39.413
Oh, okay. Liam--
Liam, go find your father.

19:39.517 --> 19:43.000
And a chain saw.
Like right now.

19:43.103 --> 19:46.620
Uh, yeah.
Ben, grab the gravy!

19:47.965 --> 19:50.931
No... problem.

20:10.896 --> 20:12.034
Are you eating candy?

20:12.137 --> 20:13.862
The power's out, right?

20:13.965 --> 20:15.827
I'm guessing dinner's
gonna be served in, like...

20:15.931 --> 20:17.482
never, so...

20:17.586 --> 20:19.551
What happened to "abs are made
in the kitchen"?

20:19.655 --> 20:21.517
Are you seriously giving me crap
about my own diet?

20:21.620 --> 20:23.241
Actually, no.

20:29.965 --> 20:32.206
Um...

20:33.965 --> 20:35.689
- Why are you showing me this?
- So, you're prepared

20:35.793 --> 20:37.034
when you finally explain
everything to Dad.

20:37.137 --> 20:38.758
- Come on.
- I'm serious.

20:38.862 --> 20:40.413
You're gonna explain
this whole thing to him.

20:40.517 --> 20:42.068
- The truth. All of it.
- All of it. Okay.

20:42.172 --> 20:43.793
Well, you got a speech prepared
for me or something?

20:43.896 --> 20:45.310
'Cause I really can't wait
to hear it.

20:45.413 --> 20:46.965
God!
Are you hearing yourself?

20:47.068 --> 20:49.275
Are you just being a jerk
for the sake of it now?

20:49.379 --> 20:50.931
Do you not know
how to be any other way?

20:51.034 --> 20:52.586
I'm not the one who came
out here looking for a fight.

20:52.689 --> 20:54.379
- I did not--
- You know what? You're lost.

20:54.482 --> 20:56.137
You didn't go to college,
you don't know

20:56.241 --> 20:57.655
what you're doing,
and it kills you

20:57.758 --> 20:59.275
that I finally have
some confidence

20:59.379 --> 21:00.551
and I'm not leaning on you anymore.

21:00.655 --> 21:02.344
So, this is you standing
on your own?

21:02.448 --> 21:04.413
Your great accomplishment

21:04.517 --> 21:06.275
is getting our family business
shut down?

21:07.172 --> 21:09.034
What's going on here?

21:19.689 --> 21:21.310
- Well.
- I'm sorry, Mawline.

21:21.413 --> 21:23.655
I know
this is a rough day for you.

21:23.758 --> 21:25.896
What are you going to do
about this?

21:29.689 --> 21:30.724
Hmm?

21:30.827 --> 21:33.172
I presume your sister
came here

21:33.275 --> 21:35.724
to tell you it's time
for you to face the music.

21:36.724 --> 21:38.620
And I can't say I disagree.

21:40.724 --> 21:43.275
This thing
between the two of you?

21:43.379 --> 21:46.275
It is not worth it.

21:46.379 --> 21:47.827
Figure it out.

21:55.310 --> 21:56.931
Yeah. All right.

21:57.034 --> 21:59.275
This should hold, but we really
gotta reinforce it outside.

21:59.379 --> 22:03.482
- I'm gonna go check and see
why the genny's not kicking in.
- Yeah.

22:03.586 --> 22:06.206
Well, no surprise.
My flight is grounded.

22:06.310 --> 22:07.655
I gotta call Kelly.

22:07.758 --> 22:09.448
I'm not getting out of here
any time soon.

22:09.551 --> 22:12.137
- Are you guys good
for a second?
- Yeah. We're good, Cap.

22:12.241 --> 22:13.724
Good as we can be.

22:14.655 --> 22:15.896
Should we just call it?

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Because I think
we're out of options here.

22:18.103 --> 22:20.655
I disagree.
Respectfully, I disagree.

22:20.758 --> 22:22.172
Okay. Interesting.

22:22.275 --> 22:24.275
Okay, we don't have
a working kitchen, but okay.

22:24.379 --> 22:26.275
- Did our forefathers have
a "working kitchen"?
- No, Cordi,

22:26.379 --> 22:28.931
you know, I find it problematic
whenever we examine the history

22:29.034 --> 22:31.413
- of this holiday too closely--
- All right. Okay. Fair enough.

22:31.517 --> 22:33.931
I guess what I'm saying is...

22:34.034 --> 22:36.103
you know, let's work
with what we got.

22:36.206 --> 22:39.310
I mean, do all of our guests
want to be here?

22:39.413 --> 22:40.931
Absolutely not.

22:41.034 --> 22:42.896
But they can't really go
anywhere else, right?

22:43.000 --> 22:45.103
So, why don't we make
the most of it?

22:45.206 --> 22:48.103
You know, Ben is here.
Stella is here.

22:48.206 --> 22:52.034
And the power's out
so I don't know the score

22:52.137 --> 22:54.379
which means
we are still in the game.

22:54.482 --> 22:57.620
Yeah. Yeah. All right.
Matter of fact--

22:57.724 --> 23:01.103
Grab your boots.
We're taking this outside.

23:02.206 --> 23:03.793
Spatchcock the turkey.

23:05.448 --> 23:06.793
What?

23:08.551 --> 23:12.551
Okay. You, too. Yeah.

23:12.655 --> 23:14.586
Damn it...

23:14.689 --> 23:16.931
Hey, sorry, I didn't mean
to disturb. I'll, uh--

23:17.034 --> 23:19.379
No, no, no, no.
Please, stay.

23:19.482 --> 23:21.827
This is a lost cause anyway.

23:23.620 --> 23:25.172
You know, I gotta say,
I know it's tradition,

23:25.275 --> 23:29.413
but the whole Abby not cooking
on Thanksgiving

23:29.517 --> 23:31.793
always struck me as like...

23:31.896 --> 23:33.724
the most un-Abby
thing ever.

23:33.827 --> 23:37.206
It's bigger than me.

23:37.310 --> 23:39.379
Has been for years.

23:39.482 --> 23:40.965
How did the tradition start?

23:42.275 --> 23:45.482
Well, that's a bit of a story.

23:45.586 --> 23:47.000
And not a happy one.

23:48.172 --> 23:49.586
Are you sure
you wanna hear it?

23:49.689 --> 23:52.206
Please,
how many unhappy stories

23:52.310 --> 23:54.000
have we shared between us?

23:54.103 --> 23:56.137
I think
we can handle one more.

23:57.517 --> 23:58.862
Well.

23:59.896 --> 24:01.689
My mom died
on Thanksgiving.

24:03.310 --> 24:04.275
I'm so sorry.

24:04.379 --> 24:05.862
Thank you.

24:06.827 --> 24:08.827
It's been years of course.

24:08.931 --> 24:12.000
Nearly 20. But it's...

24:13.931 --> 24:15.379
...it's defined the whole day.

24:15.482 --> 24:17.655
- Right.
- You know, we--

24:17.758 --> 24:21.793
We dropped everything,
we rushed to the hospital.

24:24.931 --> 24:28.965
This is wild to think about now,
but I just remember thinking

24:29.068 --> 24:31.413
that it was so important
to keep her feet warm.

24:31.517 --> 24:34.793
Because they seemed so...

24:36.137 --> 24:37.724
...cold.

24:39.689 --> 24:43.827
And my brother, Will,
had to remind me why.

24:44.724 --> 24:48.793
- Man.
- And then Will and I got into
a fight that night.

24:48.896 --> 24:53.137
The origins of which
I-- I don't remember but...

24:54.482 --> 24:56.482
...the fury...

24:56.586 --> 24:58.551
I'll never forget.

25:00.344 --> 25:02.586
It has never been the same
between us.

25:05.379 --> 25:07.103
So...

25:08.896 --> 25:10.793
...it's a hard day
to get through.

25:11.793 --> 25:14.793
And the boys started
to make it their mission

25:14.896 --> 25:17.241
that I never lift a finger
on that day.

25:18.241 --> 25:20.000
It's a welcome distraction.

25:23.379 --> 25:25.000
And I just brought
the whole room down.

25:25.103 --> 25:27.172
Oh, come on.
I asked for it.

25:28.655 --> 25:30.275
Who wants another drink?

25:35.103 --> 25:36.241
I've got it!

25:43.586 --> 25:44.689
- Kevin?
- Yes.

25:44.793 --> 25:46.655
Uh, what are you doing here?

25:46.758 --> 25:48.758
How did you even--
the roads--

25:48.862 --> 25:50.896
- it's like freezing ice
out there.
- Yeah.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.793
And you're soaked-- oh, God,
those shoes are not--

25:52.896 --> 25:55.275
I would very much like to come
inside now, please,

25:55.379 --> 25:58.034
- if that's okay.
- Oh, yes, of course!
I'm so sorry.

25:58.137 --> 26:00.896
- It's okay.
- Sorry.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.620
So, I have some unfortunate news
from the mayor's office.

26:04.724 --> 26:07.241
- Oh.
- Turns out the storm exceeded expectations,

26:07.344 --> 26:09.965
so the city is starting
road closures out this way.

26:10.862 --> 26:12.689
And you came all the way here
to tell me that?

26:12.793 --> 26:16.758
Yeah. No. Um...

26:16.862 --> 26:19.137
Well, I figured
when Mother Nature gives you

26:19.241 --> 26:22.137
a second chance at making a
first impression with a woman

26:22.241 --> 26:24.517
who most certainly hated you
on sight,

26:24.620 --> 26:26.275
you take it.

26:27.448 --> 26:28.931
Oh.

26:29.034 --> 26:31.068
Come on, everybody,
dinner is served!

26:31.172 --> 26:33.310
Well, perfect timing.

26:33.413 --> 26:34.758
I should probably take this off.

26:34.862 --> 26:36.655
Oh, gosh. Yes, of course.

26:36.758 --> 26:39.862
- Oh, thank you.
- Oh, geez,
you really are dripping.

26:39.965 --> 26:41.724
Yeah, it's bad out there.

26:42.551 --> 26:44.172
- Ready to eat?
- Yes.

26:44.275 --> 26:47.103
I brought some wine too.
I don't know if you drink but...

26:54.068 --> 26:56.551
Stella Blue, I would love
some more creamed corn, please.

26:58.620 --> 27:00.103
Thank you.

27:00.206 --> 27:02.034
Get in on this if nobody else
is going to.

27:02.137 --> 27:03.793
Anybody want carrots?

27:06.413 --> 27:08.724
<i>♪ No, it don't cost
that much...♪</i>

27:08.827 --> 27:10.206
Hey, Walker boys.

27:10.310 --> 27:12.379
This is quite a spread.
I gotta say, wow.

27:12.482 --> 27:15.448
- Right? Given
the circumstances.
- Absolutely, yes.

27:15.551 --> 27:19.103
There is food on this table
to be thankful for.

27:19.206 --> 27:21.517
- Is there ever.
- And it's not quite 9:00 yet.

27:21.620 --> 27:24.137
00? No. No, no.

27:24.241 --> 27:26.517
Why would it be 9:00?
I didn't say 9:00.

27:26.620 --> 27:28.034
Who said 9:00?

27:28.137 --> 27:30.689
And a happy Thanksgiving,
to all who celebrate.

27:32.448 --> 27:35.137
Benjamin, this wine
you brought is excellent.

27:35.241 --> 27:37.344
- Thank you so much.
- I'm so glad you're
enjoying it, sir.

27:37.448 --> 27:40.965
Oh, yeah, I love this vineyard.
This is a great year too.

27:41.068 --> 27:43.068
- Who is he again?
- That's Kevin

27:43.172 --> 27:44.827
- from the mayor's office.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

27:44.931 --> 27:46.620
Kevin Golden.
Nice to meet you all.

27:46.724 --> 27:47.689
Thank you guys for having me.

27:47.793 --> 27:49.517
Oh, nice handshake.

27:53.931 --> 27:55.862
Apologies if
the bird is uneven,

27:55.965 --> 27:58.068
Mama, we were cooking it
outside by flashlight.

27:58.172 --> 28:00.172
Yeah, yeah.

28:00.275 --> 28:01.620
Oh, of course.

28:01.724 --> 28:02.896
I was just wondering...

28:03.000 --> 28:04.620
since, you know,
it was only killed

28:04.724 --> 28:07.103
a few hours ago,
why it was frozen?

28:08.344 --> 28:10.965
Unforeseen circumstances.
- The ice storm.

28:11.068 --> 28:12.586
It was really hard to control
the flame,

28:12.689 --> 28:15.793
with all the wind outside.
Is it really frozen?

28:15.896 --> 28:18.413
Do we have
any fresh cranberry relish?

28:18.517 --> 28:20.793
Fresh-- I thought
we always used the canned.

28:20.896 --> 28:22.965
- To be ironic.
- I like the canned.

28:23.068 --> 28:24.724
- Nostalgic.
- Me, too.
- Amen to that.

28:24.827 --> 28:26.689
Fair point, fair point.

28:26.793 --> 28:28.586
Sure, we should have

28:28.689 --> 28:30.310
homemade relish,
actually though--

28:30.413 --> 28:33.379
That's my bad.
I thought, Cordi, you had it.

28:33.482 --> 28:35.413
I was on gravy,
but then we lost it

28:35.517 --> 28:37.965
- when the window blew out--
- We didn't lose the gravy.

28:38.068 --> 28:39.551
That's the gravy right there, right?

28:39.655 --> 28:41.413
New guy, what's that there
in the gravy boat?

28:41.517 --> 28:43.379
- August, it's Kevin.
- No, it's fine.

28:44.275 --> 28:48.344
I wouldn't presume
to label the dish per se.

28:48.448 --> 28:49.896
May I? Thank you.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.517
- Be careful.
- Yep.

28:56.068 --> 28:59.137
Yeah, I don't think
this is the-- the gravy.

28:59.241 --> 29:01.758
I think
this is the chestnut soup.

29:01.862 --> 29:03.551
There's a backup plan, right?

29:03.655 --> 29:06.965
Hey, Augie, are you already
full? Seems like you barely ate.

29:07.068 --> 29:09.103
I hope you weren't snacking before.

29:09.206 --> 29:11.275
- Why don't you give it a rest?
- Mama, please.

29:11.379 --> 29:13.482
Excuse me?

29:13.586 --> 29:15.000
Please don't stress.

29:15.103 --> 29:17.758
Today is a stress-free day
for Mama, right?

29:17.862 --> 29:19.034
You know, our guests are here.

29:19.137 --> 29:21.275
We have Kevin,
Ben is here, Colton,

29:21.379 --> 29:23.793
Stella is here,
everybody's here, it's nice.

29:23.896 --> 29:25.655
- Is it?
- Yeah.

29:25.758 --> 29:27.241
Because your children seem to be

29:27.344 --> 29:29.931
not so subtly bickering,
if you hadn't noticed.

29:30.034 --> 29:32.310
I've noticed. Yes.
I-- I see that.

29:32.413 --> 29:35.310
But I was going to deal
with that in my own way.

29:35.413 --> 29:36.448
But thank you.

29:36.551 --> 29:38.206
Then by all means.

29:39.137 --> 29:40.793
You know, now that
I know that this is soup,

29:40.896 --> 29:42.862
I really appreciate it.

29:42.965 --> 29:45.620
Speaking of appreciation...

29:45.724 --> 29:48.206
maybe we should do
the Circle of Thanks now.

29:48.310 --> 29:51.172
We haven't even brought out dessert.

29:51.275 --> 29:53.103
Yeah. What's the
over/under on dessert?

29:53.206 --> 29:55.206
There's dessert, Cap!
There is dessert.

29:55.310 --> 29:56.896
You know what?
Okay, how about this?

29:57.000 --> 29:58.965
Stella Blue,
you have always said

29:59.068 --> 30:00.275
you wanted to "mix things up"
on Thanksgiving.

30:00.379 --> 30:02.000
So, let's do it.
Let's mix things up.

30:02.103 --> 30:04.103
How about we start with dessert
right now?

30:04.206 --> 30:05.862
I think it's time.

30:05.965 --> 30:08.137
The Baked Alaska?
Dad, there's no way--

30:08.241 --> 30:11.862
No, no, no, yes, there is a way.
The-- yes way.

30:11.965 --> 30:13.413
We salvaged it.

30:13.517 --> 30:16.206
Ice storm worked
in our favor, know what I mean.

30:17.034 --> 30:18.655
I mean,
show a little faith, Stel.

30:18.758 --> 30:20.482
Come on.
Dad did this all for you.

30:20.586 --> 30:22.379
- Is this how
you show your appreciation?
- Shut up, August.

30:22.482 --> 30:24.448
All right,
I think you two need to

30:24.551 --> 30:27.000
- nip it in the bud
right about now.
- Don't bother, love, I tried.

30:27.103 --> 30:29.724
And I told you
not to worry about it, Mama.

30:29.827 --> 30:31.551
Okay. I got it.

30:31.655 --> 30:33.517
I'll be right back.

30:33.620 --> 30:35.551
You know, maybe you should
listen for once, Dad.

30:35.655 --> 30:39.448
- Especially today, for Mawline--
- Oh, don't make this about me.

30:39.551 --> 30:41.103
Yeah, show some
sensitivity, Stel.

30:41.206 --> 30:43.758
Okay. You need to cool it.

30:43.862 --> 30:45.241
He's got a blow torch.

30:45.344 --> 30:47.137
Just wanna make sure
everyone's aware

30:47.241 --> 30:49.482
there's now
a blow torch in the room.

30:49.586 --> 30:50.896
I got it.

30:52.758 --> 30:55.793
Okay. For God's sake, would
you just show him the paper?

30:55.896 --> 30:57.758
That's a little high.

30:57.862 --> 30:59.586
What paper?

31:00.620 --> 31:04.655
The Side Step lost
its liquor license.

31:04.758 --> 31:06.103
I'm sorry?

31:09.000 --> 31:10.758
Ha...

31:10.862 --> 31:12.241
Okay.

31:15.034 --> 31:17.172
Stella Blue.

31:18.965 --> 31:20.379
Depending on
the circumstances,

31:20.482 --> 31:22.034
I might actually be able
to help with that.

31:22.137 --> 31:24.137
No. Absolutely not.

31:24.241 --> 31:27.310
Thank you,
my daughter is an adult now,

31:27.413 --> 31:29.827
and she needs to take
responsibility for her actions.

31:29.931 --> 31:31.620
Okay, you know what?
Enough.

31:31.724 --> 31:33.827
No. You do need to listen.

31:33.931 --> 31:35.241
Because it was August.

31:35.344 --> 31:37.241
It was August
who threw the party.

31:37.344 --> 31:39.379
It was August who got
his sister thrown in jail.

31:39.482 --> 31:41.137
And it was August
who lost your liquor license.

31:41.241 --> 31:42.931
And I know you don't like
me getting involved,

31:43.034 --> 31:46.034
Cordell, but I cannot,
and I refuse

31:46.137 --> 31:48.310
to watch your son
skate by on privilege.

31:48.413 --> 31:50.068
He got away with something

31:50.172 --> 31:52.000
and he actually seems
proud of it.

31:52.103 --> 31:55.379
And it makes me afraid of
what he might become.

32:00.241 --> 32:03.034
You don't have to be
such a bitch about it, Mawline.

32:03.137 --> 32:04.482
- August...
- What the hell did you just say?

32:04.586 --> 32:06.655
Okay, hold on, Daddy,
I'll handle this--

32:06.758 --> 32:09.310
I guess you better handle it,
Cordell, or by God, I will.

32:09.413 --> 32:10.655
Yes, sir,
I will handle it. August.

32:10.758 --> 32:11.896
You listen to me.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.931
Mama. Mama!

32:14.034 --> 32:15.448
Real nice.

32:26.827 --> 32:30.034
You know, I never understood
the whole Black Friday thing

32:30.137 --> 32:32.034
but after that...

32:33.068 --> 32:34.206
I'm starting to see the appeal

32:34.310 --> 32:36.103
of escaping into your phone.

32:37.206 --> 32:39.724
Come on in,
the water's fine.

32:39.827 --> 32:41.586
It's just--

32:41.689 --> 32:43.413
You know, this whole...

32:43.517 --> 32:47.931
Circle of Thanks thing,
it's a tradition.

32:48.034 --> 32:50.448
And I just really wanted to...

32:52.827 --> 32:55.655
...tell you
how thankful I am for you.

32:55.758 --> 32:57.448
I don't know
why I was acting so weird

32:57.551 --> 32:59.586
and I'm still acting weird,
I'm acting weird again.

32:59.689 --> 33:01.965
No. No, no, no, no.

33:02.068 --> 33:04.103
But I get it.

33:04.206 --> 33:06.827
And I should have
just said it earlier,

33:06.931 --> 33:09.413
but Cass
and I used to always make

33:09.517 --> 33:12.310
such a big deal
about Black Friday.

33:12.413 --> 33:15.724
We haven't done it for so long.

33:15.827 --> 33:17.241
And I've been psyched

33:17.344 --> 33:19.482
about us getting back
to a good place.

33:20.586 --> 33:21.965
I just--

33:22.068 --> 33:23.586
I didn't want to ditch her

33:23.689 --> 33:26.689
just because I'm excited
about my new relationship.

33:27.793 --> 33:29.655
- But I am.
- Me too.

33:29.758 --> 33:32.965
That's why I was yammering on
about mashed potatoes earlier.

33:33.068 --> 33:35.793
Did you just make a tuber pun?

33:35.896 --> 33:37.344
It was unintentional.

33:38.862 --> 33:40.241
It was adorable.

33:42.793 --> 33:45.000
I'm glad I stayed tonight.

33:45.965 --> 33:49.655
I mean, I didn't really have
a choice with the storm, but--

33:52.137 --> 33:53.896
I'm glad that you stayed, too.

33:54.000 --> 33:58.034
Also, Cass's date said
that the roads are open now.

33:58.137 --> 33:59.862
Then let's get
the hell out of here.

33:59.965 --> 34:02.000
If you're still
in the mood for tradition,

34:02.103 --> 34:04.275
I think we could just about make
the store opening--

34:04.379 --> 34:05.827
Okay. Let's go.
Yes, let's do it.

34:05.931 --> 34:07.655
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Hey.

34:07.758 --> 34:09.034
Huh?

34:17.965 --> 34:19.482
I am grateful for you.

34:19.586 --> 34:21.344
Me too.

34:21.448 --> 34:24.344
Let's go.

34:33.275 --> 34:36.689
Well, you may very well be
the world's best house guest,

34:36.793 --> 34:40.068
but I don't think anybody needs
any memory of that dinner.

34:40.172 --> 34:41.655
Oh, you never know.

34:41.758 --> 34:43.310
There's gotta be
some livestock around here

34:43.413 --> 34:44.827
curious about the chestnut soup.

34:44.931 --> 34:47.103
That's very generous.

34:49.724 --> 34:53.724
I feel
like I owe you an apology.

34:53.827 --> 34:56.137
I didn't know what I
was inviting you into.

34:56.241 --> 34:58.034
Oh, no. Are you kidding?

34:58.137 --> 35:00.724
It might sound kind of messed up
but I actually enjoyed it.

35:00.827 --> 35:02.655
I don't come
from a big family.

35:02.758 --> 35:04.758
So, I've always wondered
what it would be like

35:04.862 --> 35:07.275
to have a loud
and chaotic table.

35:07.379 --> 35:10.827
And it turns out
it was pretty entertaining.

35:10.931 --> 35:12.275
I regret nothing.

35:12.379 --> 35:14.793
I just hope
it wasn't our only chance

35:14.896 --> 35:16.931
at a real date.

35:20.413 --> 35:22.862
Look, I'm terrible at this.

35:22.965 --> 35:24.758
- Dating.
- Mm. Yeah.

35:24.862 --> 35:26.689
I just feel like...

35:26.793 --> 35:30.758
everyone took a class
or something

35:30.862 --> 35:33.137
in their 20s
and I just missed it.

35:33.241 --> 35:35.896
And now I'm here
and I don't even know

35:36.000 --> 35:38.241
how to have a conversation.

35:38.344 --> 35:41.068
I'd actually be
very suspicious of a person

35:41.172 --> 35:43.172
who excelled at dating.

35:43.275 --> 35:45.068
You know what I mean?

35:45.172 --> 35:47.310
Well, my "connection"

35:47.413 --> 35:49.413
at the mayor's office
just told me

35:49.517 --> 35:52.724
- that the roads were open.
- Yes, they are.

35:52.827 --> 35:55.827
But my brother
did just drive off in my car.

35:57.655 --> 35:59.275
Well...

36:05.793 --> 36:08.793
Are you sure you're as bad
at this as you say?

36:08.896 --> 36:10.517
Oh, I promise.

36:16.896 --> 36:19.172
Still wanna head back
to my place?

36:19.275 --> 36:22.206
Yeah, we should've gone
hours ago.

36:23.206 --> 36:25.344
Hey, Stella, Stella, hey.

36:26.896 --> 36:28.655
Just hold on a second.

36:32.689 --> 36:34.931
I just--

36:38.206 --> 36:40.862
I should have listened to you.

36:40.965 --> 36:44.965
What's happening with August,
I missed it.

36:45.068 --> 36:48.620
He's been changing
and I've been stuck.

36:48.724 --> 36:50.862
Kind of like I've been,
you know, watching home movies

36:50.965 --> 36:54.482
of the kid I thought I had,
you know?

36:57.068 --> 37:01.931
It doesn't matter,
my point is that you're right.

37:02.034 --> 37:04.517
I gave him yards of slack,

37:04.620 --> 37:05.931
and I didn't give you
an inch.

37:06.034 --> 37:07.931
And I can see that now.

37:08.034 --> 37:09.482
I see that very clearly.

37:11.103 --> 37:12.689
Just, you know--

37:12.793 --> 37:15.000
I hope I'm not too late.

37:16.620 --> 37:18.517
I don't know, Dad.

37:19.448 --> 37:22.172
I hope it's not too late, too, but...

37:22.275 --> 37:23.827
we're pretty far gone.

37:23.931 --> 37:27.275
And right now I'm tired.

37:27.379 --> 37:29.034
So...

37:29.137 --> 37:30.241
have a good night.

37:30.344 --> 37:31.965
Good night.

37:32.068 --> 37:33.103
Night, Mr. Walker.

37:33.206 --> 37:34.689
Night, Colton.

37:43.241 --> 37:45.413
Cap. Hey, uh...

37:45.517 --> 37:48.551
- You headed out?
- About to, yeah.

37:48.655 --> 37:50.034
Hell of a day, huh?

37:52.310 --> 37:54.241
Yeah. Yeah.

37:54.344 --> 37:55.862
Look, now is not the time,

37:55.965 --> 37:57.827
but when things settle down
for you a little bit,

37:57.931 --> 38:01.413
there's something that you
and Perez and I need to discuss.

38:01.517 --> 38:03.620
Yes, sir. You bet.

38:03.724 --> 38:05.482
- Good night, Cap.
- Yeah.

38:37.827 --> 38:40.862
I don't know where to begin.

38:40.965 --> 38:43.103
Partially...

38:44.551 --> 38:45.896
...because...

38:46.931 --> 38:48.827
...I'm not sure
I even recognize you right now.

38:48.931 --> 38:50.517
I'm sorry.
It just kind of came out.

38:50.620 --> 38:52.068
And I got really mad,
and I don't know.

38:52.172 --> 38:53.827
- It's not an excuse--
- No, it's not.

38:53.931 --> 38:57.137
- It's not an excuse.
- I know, Dad, I keep messing up.

38:57.241 --> 38:59.620
Take a breath.

38:59.724 --> 39:01.379
I can't control it, okay?
I don't know.

39:01.482 --> 39:03.103
I don't know
how to fix it, I--

39:03.206 --> 39:05.965
Okay, then maybe
we can figure that out together.

39:06.068 --> 39:07.241
I don't know how!

39:07.344 --> 39:09.206
I don't either, Augie.

39:09.310 --> 39:11.586
But I'm willing to learn.

39:13.103 --> 39:14.724
You know...

39:16.379 --> 39:19.448
Part of me has been so caught up
in saying goodbye to your sister

39:19.551 --> 39:22.482
that I lost sight of the fact
that you're still here.

39:24.206 --> 39:26.827
And that you still need me.

39:27.689 --> 39:31.103
Tell me, Augie, um...

39:33.793 --> 39:36.000
...how did we get here?

39:39.068 --> 39:41.827
I mean, I know
it's been going on for a while.

39:41.931 --> 39:45.206
But whatever happened
to August the Noble?

39:45.310 --> 39:47.068
That was never actually me.

39:48.586 --> 39:50.896
I'm just a horrible person, Dad.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.931
No, no, no, no.
Do not say that.

39:53.034 --> 39:55.586
Okay, you literally said
you don't even recognize me.

39:55.689 --> 39:57.448
And maybe that's my fault.

39:57.551 --> 39:58.896
You know?

40:00.172 --> 40:02.620
You know, maybe part
of me thought that

40:02.724 --> 40:04.827
you would figure it all out
on your own.

40:04.931 --> 40:06.413
You know, figure out
how to grow up.

40:06.517 --> 40:08.137
You were doing such a great job.

40:08.241 --> 40:12.413
Honestly, a time came
when I thought to myself...

40:12.517 --> 40:16.000
hell, what do I
even have to offer?

40:18.689 --> 40:21.517
But, son...

40:22.793 --> 40:24.827
...it's my job
to help you understand

40:24.931 --> 40:26.862
the difference
between right and wrong.

40:31.068 --> 40:32.965
You know...

40:33.068 --> 40:36.068
You don't have to be an adult
to act like a man.

40:37.862 --> 40:39.655
The top of that list...

40:39.758 --> 40:41.620
is how we speak about
and treat women.

40:41.724 --> 40:44.586
But, first things first.

40:44.689 --> 40:47.448
You need to find
your grandmother...

40:47.551 --> 40:49.448
and you need to apologize
to her.
