<i>Previously on Once Upon A Time...</i>

00:02.487 --> 00:04.491
What exactly did you do to Maleficent?

00:04.491 --> 00:07.459
Because of us... Maleficent lost her child.

00:07.494 --> 00:09.228
Gold's plan... I'm
afraid it involves Emma.

00:09.262 --> 00:12.397
He plans to fill her heart
with darkness forever.

00:12.432 --> 00:13.866
This isn't just an illustration.

00:13.900 --> 00:16.502
The Author is trapped inside the book.

00:36.656 --> 00:40.825
- What is it? Did the trail go cold?
- Shh.

00:44.797 --> 00:45.897
Well, come on. Let's get this over with.

00:45.931 --> 00:47.898
Snow...

00:47.932 --> 00:49.733
I know you're worried about
Maleficent's protections.

00:49.768 --> 00:50.934
Aren't you?

00:50.969 --> 00:53.003
If she's right, our child
could end up with a dark heart.

00:53.038 --> 00:54.938
Or it could grow to be a powerful hero.

00:54.973 --> 00:57.241
She said that, too, and who's
to say we can even trust her?

00:57.276 --> 00:59.910
Let's find out.

01:01.813 --> 01:03.347
According to legend,

01:03.382 --> 01:06.984
all we need to do is touch its horn...

01:07.018 --> 01:10.320
And we'll get a glimpse
of our child's future.

01:35.246 --> 01:38.647
Ohh.

01:38.682 --> 01:41.450
Yes.

01:41.484 --> 01:44.053
Look at you.

01:44.088 --> 01:46.689
You are so beautiful.

01:51.394 --> 01:53.062
Snow, it's all right.

01:53.097 --> 01:54.463
Our baby's gonna be all right!

01:54.497 --> 01:55.831
Snow?

02:09.178 --> 02:12.147
Look at you.

02:12.181 --> 02:14.716
You're so beautiful.

02:21.023 --> 02:23.158
What are you doing?!

02:23.192 --> 02:26.361
Please! I'm your mother!

02:26.395 --> 02:29.697
I don't care.

02:33.969 --> 02:38.406
Did you see? Our child's
gonna be just fine.

02:38.440 --> 02:39.707
No. No, it's not.

02:41.076 --> 02:43.410
It's evil.

02:54.906 --> 02:56.974
how the hell is The Author
trapped inside the book?

02:57.008 --> 02:58.809
Don't ask me. You're the magic expert.

02:58.843 --> 03:00.780
- Mom.
- Well, this is insane.

03:00.780 --> 03:02.179
What are we supposed to do, draw a key?

03:02.213 --> 03:03.813
What we need to do is figure
it out before Gold does.

03:03.847 --> 03:05.515
- Mom!
- What is it?

03:05.550 --> 03:08.085
There's something wrong with August.

03:08.119 --> 03:10.853
August? August?

03:12.022 --> 03:15.225
We need to get him help.

03:22.299 --> 03:24.200
He's been through a lot.

03:24.234 --> 03:28.337
What's happening? He was awake,
and then he passed out, and...

03:28.371 --> 03:30.239
well, he's been changed
by magic many times.

03:31.161 --> 03:33.790
For him to survive this, he
will have to be very strong.

03:34.577 --> 03:36.177
We have a bigger problem.

03:38.481 --> 03:41.450
Gold and these other
witches are expecting me.

03:41.484 --> 03:44.085
They sent me on a mission to
get that page from the book.

03:44.119 --> 03:46.455
And if I return empty-handed,

03:46.489 --> 03:49.390
whatever suspicions they
have of me will be confirmed.

03:49.425 --> 03:52.427
Then give them this.

03:54.396 --> 03:56.397
Wow. You're getting good.

03:56.432 --> 03:57.465
I've been practicing.

03:57.499 --> 03:58.640
A forgery?

03:58.640 --> 04:00.181
This is Gold we're talking about.

04:00.181 --> 04:01.752
Then pull out, and we will protect you.

04:02.237 --> 04:04.572
We still don't
know what they're up to.

04:04.606 --> 04:06.574
It's a bigger risk not to know.

04:08.309 --> 04:10.277
That's them.

04:10.311 --> 04:12.145
Probably wondering where I am.

04:12.180 --> 04:13.714
Mom, the forgery's good.

04:13.748 --> 04:16.315
Not good enough.

04:16.351 --> 04:21.053
But maybe what we need is
a different kind of copy.

04:22.156 --> 04:24.456
Because Gold and those witches
don't know that the page

04:24.456 --> 04:26.280
contains the actual door.

04:26.280 --> 04:27.566
All they care about is
what the door looks like.

04:27.680 --> 04:29.127
Hopefully, this photo will keep them

04:29.127 --> 04:31.298
on their wild goose chase around town.

04:31.332 --> 04:34.934
I've got to get going. Bye, Henry.

04:37.305 --> 04:39.305
Okay, mom.

04:39.339 --> 04:42.108
Sorry. Sorry. Just not sure if...

04:42.142 --> 04:46.212
When I'll be back to see you.

04:47.180 --> 04:51.217
But don't worry. I'll be fine.

04:54.989 --> 04:57.156
Hey.

04:59.159 --> 05:01.793
Killian, what's wrong?

05:03.296 --> 05:04.349
Before Ursula left,

05:04.349 --> 05:06.684
she told me what the villains have planned.

05:06.719 --> 05:08.886
To get their happy endings,

05:08.921 --> 05:10.566
they intend to darken your heart, love,

05:11.667 --> 05:12.807
to turn you into a villain

05:12.807 --> 05:15.675
so you'll no longer be the savior.

05:15.710 --> 05:18.177
What? You can't just un-savior the savior.

05:18.212 --> 05:19.779
Ursula said Gold has a way.

05:19.814 --> 05:21.581
He can use The Author to do it.

05:21.616 --> 05:24.017
That's insane.

05:24.051 --> 05:26.252
If that's what their
plan is, stop worrying.

05:26.286 --> 05:28.021
It's ridiculous.

05:28.055 --> 05:30.189
Author or no author, I am not going dark.

05:30.224 --> 05:32.191
But darkness is a funny thing.

05:32.226 --> 05:34.293
It creeps up in you.

05:34.328 --> 05:37.463
Hey.

05:37.498 --> 05:42.101
No one... not Rumplestiltskin
or some author...

05:42.136 --> 05:44.803
gets to decide who I am.

05:52.135 --> 05:53.525
Do you really think it's possible?

05:54.529 --> 05:56.295
Emma going dark after what we did?

05:56.331 --> 05:58.364
No, it shouldn't be.

05:58.399 --> 06:01.701
We were told that we had to guide her,

06:01.736 --> 06:03.970
that her fate rested with us.

06:04.005 --> 06:06.372
But this author...

06:06.407 --> 06:08.007
he has the power to change everything.

06:08.042 --> 06:11.210
I mean, he's going to write
the villains' happy endings.

06:11.246 --> 06:14.080
Who knows what he can do to Emma?

06:14.115 --> 06:16.949
We have to do something...

06:16.985 --> 06:18.651
Without Emma finding out the truth.

06:22.290 --> 06:23.789
She'll be fine.

06:27.595 --> 06:28.828
Oh, at last.

06:28.863 --> 06:30.796
I feel I've aged a decade waiting for you.

06:30.832 --> 06:32.765
Well, you certainly look like it.

06:32.800 --> 06:35.735
Where's the page, Regina?

06:36.738 --> 06:37.803
Don't tell me you failed.

06:37.839 --> 06:39.772
The page was under
a protection spell...

06:39.807 --> 06:41.807
something cooked up by the savior.

06:41.843 --> 06:43.609
She almost caught me trying to break it.

06:43.645 --> 06:44.705
I had to flee.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.179
Are you sure that's what happened?

06:46.214 --> 06:49.215
Of course I am.

06:49.250 --> 06:52.285
It's just that you've been
gone an awfully long time...

06:52.320 --> 06:54.687
And yet you come back empty-handed.

06:54.722 --> 06:57.423
I'm not empty-handed.

06:57.458 --> 06:59.859
I got this.

06:59.894 --> 07:02.161
A photograph.

07:02.197 --> 07:03.963
Oh, and an incompetent one, too.

07:03.998 --> 07:06.299
That glare ruins any
clear view of the door.

07:08.636 --> 07:10.536
No, that's not a glare.

07:13.174 --> 07:14.907
That's magic.

07:14.943 --> 07:17.577
This door has been sealed by it.

07:17.612 --> 07:19.712
This is the door we've been looking for.

07:19.747 --> 07:22.548
You think The Author is
trapped in an illustration?

07:22.584 --> 07:23.883
But that
would mean...

07:23.918 --> 07:25.952
The Sorcerer imprisoned him in the book.

07:25.987 --> 07:27.653
We need to get it.

07:27.689 --> 07:29.855
Bring us the page.

07:29.891 --> 07:31.757
That won't be easy.

07:31.793 --> 07:34.660
The savior isn't about to
let it out of her sight.

07:34.696 --> 07:37.196
Don't worry about her.
I've got just the thing.

07:39.834 --> 07:43.669
How was he?

07:43.705 --> 07:46.172
The wooden man-child... how was he?

07:46.207 --> 07:49.542
Not great.

07:49.577 --> 07:51.010
You care for him?

07:51.045 --> 07:52.478
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

07:52.513 --> 07:55.248
Oh, Killian.

07:55.283 --> 07:56.983
Now's not the time to be jealous.

07:57.018 --> 07:58.584
Why would I be jealous?

07:58.620 --> 08:01.120
Though I do know you're partial
to men in leather jackets.

08:01.155 --> 08:02.955
He's just a friend.

08:02.991 --> 08:04.790
Yeah, of course.

08:04.826 --> 08:06.092
See... Well, you remember

08:06.127 --> 08:08.046
that video I showed you
from the foster home?

08:08.046 --> 08:09.328
With your friend when you were a girl?

08:09.364 --> 08:11.264
Lily. Her name was Lily.

08:11.299 --> 08:13.065
She was my first and best friend,

08:13.101 --> 08:15.501
and I pushed her away forever.

08:15.536 --> 08:17.136
And after that, I just...

08:18.606 --> 08:20.673
Wasn't great at making friends.

08:20.708 --> 08:24.243
August was the rare exception.

08:24.279 --> 08:26.679
That's why this is so important to me.

08:26.714 --> 08:29.015
There's nothing else going on,

08:29.050 --> 08:30.816
really.

08:30.852 --> 08:31.884
What?

08:31.919 --> 08:34.486
Emma. Look.

08:34.522 --> 08:36.289
What the hell is tha...

08:44.532 --> 08:47.931
It's done. Now let's get to work.

08:52.340 --> 08:54.452
Snow, you have to tell
me. What did you see?

08:54.452 --> 08:55.472
No.

08:56.962 --> 08:59.696
Saying it out loud will
make it too... Real.

08:59.731 --> 09:03.066
We just have to find a way to
help our child save its future.

09:03.101 --> 09:05.327
Pardon me, but a hand, please.

09:05.504 --> 09:06.984
I'm having trouble with my wagon.

09:06.984 --> 09:08.207
I'm afraid it's a bit stuck.

09:08.405 --> 09:09.506
Here. Allow me.

09:09.541 --> 09:11.405
Sorry, it's heavy,
overloaded with trinkets.

09:11.405 --> 09:13.476
I'm a peddler, but apparently
not a very good one.

09:15.447 --> 09:17.981
Oh, oh!

09:18.016 --> 09:20.216
Just needed a little
elbow grease. Thank you.

09:20.252 --> 09:22.252
Uh-huh. Ooh, it's
colder than a witch's...

09:23.121 --> 09:25.388
foot out here, isn't it?

09:25.424 --> 09:26.690
Here. Some Brandy.

09:26.725 --> 09:28.692
Oh. It'll warm you on your journey.

09:28.727 --> 09:30.260
I never turn down Brandy.

09:30.295 --> 09:32.696
You're too kind. Mmm.

09:32.731 --> 09:34.898
Mmm! Kind of nutmeg-y.

09:34.933 --> 09:36.466
Keep it.

09:36.501 --> 09:37.767
Good luck to you, then.

09:37.803 --> 09:40.051
Wait. You're going west?

09:40.051 --> 09:41.504
Uh, that is where our home lies.

09:41.540 --> 09:44.007
There... there is a
terrible sorceress who's

09:44.042 --> 09:45.642
taken up residence down that way.

09:45.677 --> 09:47.377
They call her... Maleficent.

09:48.547 --> 09:49.813
She's just awful.

09:49.848 --> 09:52.115
We know. We've crossed paths.

09:52.150 --> 09:53.450
Did you hear what happened?

09:54.186 --> 09:56.853
She turned herself into a
heinous dragon and laid an egg.

09:56.888 --> 09:58.416
An egg?

09:58.416 --> 10:00.357
Yes, the beast made her nest in a cave.

10:00.392 --> 10:02.258
She scorched all the earth around it,

10:02.294 --> 10:04.361
marking her territory... everyone fled,

10:04.396 --> 10:05.895
including yours truly.

10:05.931 --> 10:08.231
My recommendation... go east.

10:08.266 --> 10:09.833
The infinite forest?

10:09.868 --> 10:11.301
We could get lost for days.

10:11.336 --> 10:14.337
Just stick to the path until
you come upon a cottage.

10:14.373 --> 10:15.481
There's a kind, old man.

10:15.511 --> 10:17.221
He'll help you get
where you need to be.

10:18.097 --> 10:20.076
Trust me.

10:20.112 --> 10:21.778
Thank you.

10:21.813 --> 10:23.713
Safe journey.

10:25.851 --> 10:28.685
Mmm!

10:40.632 --> 10:42.532
There.

10:49.041 --> 10:53.843
I was wondering when you would arrive.

10:53.879 --> 10:55.278
You were expecting us?

10:55.313 --> 10:57.380
I sensed you coming.

10:57.416 --> 11:01.618
I also sensed that you are
at a loss over your child.

11:04.156 --> 11:05.889
Uh, why don't you come inside for some tea?

11:05.924 --> 11:08.124
I'll explain everything.

11:10.896 --> 11:12.529
Is that Maleficent?

11:12.564 --> 11:13.830
Oh, yes, yes. Do come in.

11:13.865 --> 11:16.232
You don't have to worry about her here.

11:16.268 --> 11:19.602
Now, you know what you have to do.

11:19.638 --> 11:22.839
Quite well. The question is, do you?

11:22.874 --> 11:26.076
Our deal was that you were
gonna help me find The Author

11:26.111 --> 11:28.178
and our happiness would be secured.

11:28.213 --> 11:31.581
Well, I'm altering the
deal because, let's face it,

11:31.616 --> 11:34.017
you need that page from
the book to get The Author.

11:34.052 --> 11:36.786
And to do that, you need me.

11:36.822 --> 11:38.088
Do I?

11:38.123 --> 11:41.191
I just put the town to sleep. I'm useful.

11:41.226 --> 11:43.126
And we all know Cruella and Ursula

11:43.161 --> 11:45.595
were a means to an end... me.

11:45.630 --> 11:47.363
That's why you haven't shed one tear

11:47.399 --> 11:50.033
over our tentacled
friend's departure...

11:50.068 --> 11:51.334
because you have me.

11:51.369 --> 11:55.305
And to have me means you
have to give me what I want.

11:55.340 --> 11:58.241
It's, oh, so simple.

11:58.276 --> 12:01.144
I need to know what happened to my child

12:01.179 --> 12:03.746
after those two heroes got rid of it.

12:03.782 --> 12:06.015
I need to know its fate.

12:06.051 --> 12:09.552
In return, I will get us both The Author.

12:09.588 --> 12:11.354
We'll get you the page.

12:11.389 --> 12:15.191
And once I know what they
really did to my child,

12:15.227 --> 12:17.927
those heroes will pay.

12:19.898 --> 12:22.532
Mary Margaret.

12:25.170 --> 12:27.270
Mary Margaret, are you okay?

12:27.305 --> 12:30.907
No, I'm not... we made
a vow, David, to be good.

12:30.942 --> 12:33.329
And ever since Cruella and Ursula arrived,

12:33.521 --> 12:34.711
we've done nothing but lie.

12:34.746 --> 12:36.012
They want to turn Emma dark!

12:36.047 --> 12:37.280
I know!

12:37.315 --> 12:40.450
And if we're not careful,
we're going to help them.

12:44.756 --> 12:46.422
David, look.

12:49.828 --> 12:51.060
They're all asleep.

12:51.096 --> 12:52.128
Why aren't we?

12:52.164 --> 12:53.363
Maybe because we're immune.

12:53.398 --> 12:54.964
We've both been under a sleeping curse.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.700
But Emma hasn't!

12:58.970 --> 13:01.504
The savior
looks a lot less threatening

13:01.540 --> 13:03.273
in this state, doesn't she?

13:03.308 --> 13:05.542
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't tempted

13:05.577 --> 13:08.444
to wring her scrawny neck right now.

13:08.480 --> 13:11.681
Don't even think about it.

13:11.716 --> 13:14.517
I think we can all agree that

13:14.553 --> 13:17.687
killing the savior at this
point would be ill-advised.

13:19.558 --> 13:22.125
You're right about that,

13:22.160 --> 13:24.227
yet wrong about the location of the page.

13:24.262 --> 13:25.361
It's not here.

13:25.397 --> 13:27.697
We just have to keep looking.

13:27.732 --> 13:29.232
The page was here two hours ago.

13:29.267 --> 13:32.435
It didn't just grow legs and
walk out of here on its own.

13:32.470 --> 13:34.437
Unless someone walked out of here with it.

13:34.472 --> 13:36.773
I put the whole town to sleep.

13:36.808 --> 13:38.942
Except those who have
been under a sleeping curse

13:38.977 --> 13:41.945
and are immune.

13:41.980 --> 13:44.480
I may know a resourceful
young man who's wide awake.

13:49.673 --> 13:50.813
One who's very protective

13:50.813 --> 13:52.722
of the storybook and all its contents...

13:53.992 --> 13:55.920
one who's gonna test
his mother's commitment,

13:55.920 --> 13:56.924
towards helping me.

14:01.829 --> 14:03.918
No one goes near Henry but me.

14:03.939 --> 14:05.085
If you have a problem with that,

14:05.085 --> 14:06.882
you can take it up with
one of my fireballs.

14:10.176 --> 14:11.014
Follow her,

14:11.164 --> 14:13.331
and do what's necessary
to convince the boy.

14:13.367 --> 14:15.233
That page is the key.

14:15.269 --> 14:17.035
Let's not lose it when we're this close.

14:17.070 --> 14:18.303
Where are you off to?

14:18.338 --> 14:20.205
I have other business to attend to.

14:26.480 --> 14:27.846
Emma's not with them.

14:27.881 --> 14:28.914
What are they after?

14:33.153 --> 14:35.353
Oh, Henry!

14:35.389 --> 14:37.222
Henry, are you okay?
Where... where are you?

14:37.257 --> 14:38.890
At The Sorcerer's mansion.

14:38.926 --> 14:40.903
When everyone fell asleep, I figured

14:40.903 --> 14:42.220
the bad guys were up to something

14:42.220 --> 14:43.820
and I'd better get the page somewhere safe.

14:43.820 --> 14:45.764
Henry, don't do anything.
We are on our way.

14:45.799 --> 14:47.999
As long as you have that
page, you're in danger.

14:48.035 --> 14:50.368
Just sit tight, okay?
We're heading your way now.

14:50.404 --> 14:53.004
Let's cut around the
harbor, it'll be faster.

14:53.040 --> 14:54.606
David...

14:54.641 --> 14:57.297
- David?
- Hang on.

14:57.297 --> 14:59.321
I think there's a way we
can put a stop to all this.

14:59.321 --> 15:01.246
I think...

15:01.281 --> 15:04.549
I think we should... destroy the page.

15:04.584 --> 15:05.817
What?

15:05.852 --> 15:07.385
If we destroy it, Gold can never

15:07.421 --> 15:09.844
free The Author and use
him to turn Emma dark.

15:10.008 --> 15:12.128
The Author would be trapped
inside the book forever!

15:12.715 --> 15:13.763
Or it could kill him.

15:14.290 --> 15:15.994
Regina wouldn't get her happy
ending. We don't know that.

15:16.029 --> 15:17.796
We just know that she won't
get it from The Author.

15:17.831 --> 15:20.198
We've gone too far down this path.

15:20.233 --> 15:22.100
We have to protect Emma.

15:27.507 --> 15:29.407
My husband saw happiness for our child.

15:29.443 --> 15:30.809
I saw pure terror.

15:30.844 --> 15:32.877
But how do we know which
of our visions is real?

15:32.913 --> 15:35.013
I-I'm afraid they both are.

15:35.048 --> 15:38.016
You see, we are all born as blank slates

15:38.051 --> 15:39.951
with the potential for good or evil

15:39.987 --> 15:41.853
and with the gift of free will,

15:41.888 --> 15:44.289
so we can choose between the two,

15:44.324 --> 15:46.024
which is why there is an equal chance

15:46.059 --> 15:48.893
that either of your visions may come true.

15:48.929 --> 15:51.162
If the future I saw comes to pass,

15:51.198 --> 15:54.666
our child's life will be bleak,
full of pain and darkness.

15:54.701 --> 15:57.469
Is there nothing we can do to
ensure our child's goodness?

16:05.312 --> 16:08.646
There is... A way...

16:08.682 --> 16:11.049
To banish...

16:11.084 --> 16:14.819
The potential for darkness from your child.

16:14.855 --> 16:18.757
But as with all magic,
it comes with a price.

16:18.792 --> 16:20.358
Whatever it is, we'll pay it.

16:23.997 --> 16:25.897
You see, the laws of
magic would not allow me

16:25.932 --> 16:28.333
to simply send your child's darkness away.

16:28.368 --> 16:31.936
Another living vessel must absorb it...

16:33.340 --> 16:36.341
a vessel that is also a blank slate,

16:36.376 --> 16:38.777
unformed in the ways of good an evil,

16:38.812 --> 16:41.413
just like your baby.

16:41.448 --> 16:45.116
If you wish me to perform this magic,

16:45.152 --> 16:48.353
you must secure such a vessel.

16:48.422 --> 16:52.524
Discuss this amongst yourselves.

16:52.559 --> 16:55.527
Make sure you want to proceed.

16:55.562 --> 16:58.663
Because once this spell has been enacted,

16:58.698 --> 17:02.000
it cannot be reversed.

17:07.874 --> 17:10.775
Banishing darkness from
our child into another.

17:10.810 --> 17:15.280
Even if it is to save
our own, it's... Wrong.

17:20.387 --> 17:23.221
What if it doesn't have to be a child?

17:25.392 --> 17:29.194
The peddler said Maleficent spawned an egg.

17:29.229 --> 17:31.029
What if we can use that as our vessel?

17:31.064 --> 17:34.997
We've seen what she's like
in human and dragon form.

17:34.997 --> 17:37.502
Do you really think her dragon
offspring will be any different?

18:25.252 --> 18:26.918
No way!

18:35.862 --> 18:38.085
Grandma, grandpa, you
won't believe what I just...

18:39.666 --> 18:41.065
what, Henry?

18:42.487 --> 18:46.155
Mom. What are you doing here?

18:46.190 --> 18:48.009
I'm sorry. I didn't
want it to come to this.

18:48.589 --> 18:50.556
Looks like we're here just in time.

18:52.660 --> 18:55.227
I told you I could handle this.

18:55.263 --> 18:58.618
We're not sure you have it in
you to be a true disciplinarian.

18:59.020 --> 19:01.066
I'd say you shouldn't
be alarmed, darling,

19:01.102 --> 19:02.568
but I'd be lying.

19:02.603 --> 19:04.837
Lay a hand on my son, and I'll end you.

19:04.872 --> 19:07.751
You won't have to do anything
as long as he cooperates.

19:09.043 --> 19:10.643
Henry, give me the page.

19:10.678 --> 19:12.645
Mom, no.

19:12.680 --> 19:14.013
Henry Daniel Mills!

19:16.417 --> 19:20.653
You will do as I say.

19:27.428 --> 19:29.228
Okay.

19:34.869 --> 19:38.170
As promised.

19:38.205 --> 19:41.146
Now, let's find Gold
and set this author free.

19:51.739 --> 19:53.834
The least that Maleficent
could have done for her guards

19:53.834 --> 19:56.076
is to throw a little dragon's fire our way.

19:56.076 --> 19:57.791
If I'd known it was this cold,

19:57.791 --> 19:59.236
darling, I would have
grabbed two more puppies

19:59.236 --> 20:00.593
and made mittens.

20:02.749 --> 20:03.981
Darling?

20:04.017 --> 20:05.369
Over here.

20:05.369 --> 20:06.331
Ooh!

20:06.714 --> 20:09.649
Come on. It won't last long.

20:20.862 --> 20:22.028
What is that, a rattle?

20:23.209 --> 20:26.544
Looks to me like she
hoards anything silver.

20:26.579 --> 20:28.679
Look... there it is.

20:28.715 --> 20:32.183
A nest and the egg.

20:32.218 --> 20:34.151
Careful.

20:34.187 --> 20:36.153
It's as dangerous as she is.

21:13.761 --> 21:15.861
Snow!

21:21.168 --> 21:24.136
Torch us, Maleficent, and this burns, too!

21:32.408 --> 21:36.783
What kind of people are
you, threatening a child?

21:36.783 --> 21:40.243
Child? This isn't a child.

21:40.243 --> 21:42.243
This will become a monster, just like you.

21:42.278 --> 21:45.780
And what are you?

21:48.418 --> 21:49.984
I'm sorry.

21:50.019 --> 21:51.485
Wait! Please.

21:51.521 --> 21:56.657
Mother to mother, have mercy.

21:56.693 --> 21:59.493
I can't lose my child.

22:02.463 --> 22:04.659
We'll bring the egg back
when we're done with it.

22:05.390 --> 22:06.432
No!

22:16.232 --> 22:17.956
- Henry? Henry?!
- Henry!

22:18.530 --> 22:19.293
Oh!

22:19.293 --> 22:20.484
Come on. The villains
have to be on their way.

22:20.484 --> 22:21.936
- Already been here.
- What?

22:22.062 --> 22:24.100
- Did they take the page?
- They think they did,

22:24.100 --> 22:25.459
except my mom, of course.

22:25.495 --> 22:26.894
She just gave me a look,

22:26.930 --> 22:28.563
and I knew exactly what she meant.

22:29.999 --> 22:32.366
You gave them the forged page Emma made.

22:32.402 --> 22:33.834
Smart kid.

22:33.870 --> 22:36.237
Where's the real one?

22:38.741 --> 22:40.868
Oh, great job.

22:40.868 --> 22:42.399
Mary Margaret and I are gonna take this

22:42.399 --> 22:44.579
- and keep it safe.
- There's something else.

22:44.614 --> 22:47.515
I've found the key. We can free The Author.

22:50.920 --> 22:52.753
- Henry, hold on.
- W-what are you doing?

22:52.780 --> 22:53.888
Uh, we don't know what's gonna happen.

22:53.923 --> 22:55.423
Just let us handle things.

22:55.458 --> 22:56.657
But I found the key.

22:56.693 --> 22:59.126
Henry, it's too dangerous! Go!

23:11.608 --> 23:13.774
So, now we're lying to Henry.

23:15.278 --> 23:19.280
If we keep this up, we're
no different than Gold.

23:34.731 --> 23:36.330
My love...

23:38.401 --> 23:40.668
I need to tell you this

23:40.703 --> 23:43.971
while it still matters.

23:45.608 --> 23:50.778
My magic comes at a cost, as you know.

23:50.813 --> 23:54.515
And I have racked up so much debt

23:54.550 --> 23:58.586
I can never be clear of it...

23:58.621 --> 24:02.223
Unless I find a way to change the rules.

24:02.258 --> 24:05.793
But now...

24:05.828 --> 24:08.729
Here's the hard truth.

24:08.765 --> 24:11.766
Something else is changing.

24:11.801 --> 24:14.201
So, if I'm gonna change the rules,

24:14.237 --> 24:16.637
I'm gonna have to do so quickly.

24:28.584 --> 24:30.818
I will come back for you if...

24:34.290 --> 24:37.358
if I can.

24:41.331 --> 24:43.264
What were you doing in there?

24:43.299 --> 24:45.833
Mind your own business.
Did you find the boy?

24:45.868 --> 24:47.068
We found the boy.

24:47.103 --> 24:49.403
I found him.

24:49.439 --> 24:51.272
This is rubbish.

24:51.307 --> 24:53.407
What?

24:53.443 --> 24:54.805
It's a fake.

24:55.172 --> 24:56.744
You've spent enough time with the book.

24:56.779 --> 24:58.179
You should know the difference.

24:59.949 --> 25:01.449
They tricked me.

25:01.484 --> 25:03.050
What, you think I didn't suspect you?

25:04.020 --> 25:05.786
I've been waiting for this moment.

25:05.822 --> 25:08.489
I knew it would come. Maleficent.

25:08.524 --> 25:09.690
Wait, I can expl...

25:12.628 --> 25:16.464
bring her to her vault.

25:20.932 --> 25:23.699
Yes. This will work.

25:25.072 --> 25:26.850
So, our child's darkness...

25:27.249 --> 25:29.335
Will indeed transfer.

25:32.470 --> 25:33.582
Let the darkness

25:33.582 --> 25:35.882
find its way from tender
womb to darkest tomb.

25:35.918 --> 25:37.851
And if it sees

25:37.886 --> 25:39.953
the light of day on distant shore,

25:39.989 --> 25:41.088
where shadows loom...

25:41.123 --> 25:43.023
"Distant shore"? What does that mean?

25:43.058 --> 25:45.592
Then let no magic give
it form and work no curse,

25:45.628 --> 25:48.962
nor magic worse, on
innocents of mortals born.

25:51.133 --> 25:54.134
Sir, we're just sending the darkness

25:54.169 --> 25:55.602
into the vessel, right?

25:56.138 --> 25:58.505
Well, you would not want
anything with darkness like this

25:58.540 --> 25:59.973
living on in your realm, m'lady.

26:01.076 --> 26:03.476
I am sending it where it belongs,

26:03.512 --> 26:05.545
where it can hurt no one here.

26:05.580 --> 26:06.713
What?

26:06.748 --> 26:08.148
- No.
- You didn't tell us that.

26:08.183 --> 26:10.383
We promised its mother
we would give it back.

26:10.418 --> 26:12.485
It's
too late, I'm afraid.

26:12.521 --> 26:13.987
As I told you before,

26:14.022 --> 26:16.089
once this spell has been enacted,

26:16.124 --> 26:17.457
it cannot be reversed.

26:17.492 --> 26:19.225
There must be something you can do!

26:29.504 --> 26:31.571
Charming, it's a baby!

26:31.606 --> 26:33.106
We can still save it!

26:33.141 --> 26:35.508
Cradle robbers!

26:35.544 --> 26:36.910
What have you done?!

26:36.945 --> 26:38.511
We didn't know this was going to happen!

26:38.547 --> 26:39.646
You have to help us stop it!

26:40.649 --> 26:42.549
Ohh!

26:52.227 --> 26:53.793
What happened to them?

26:53.829 --> 26:55.595
Where did that portal send them?!

26:55.630 --> 26:56.863
Where they belong.

26:56.898 --> 26:58.865
The baby.

26:58.900 --> 27:00.867
We have to get the baby back!

27:00.902 --> 27:03.903
I'm afraid it's lost to you forever.

27:03.939 --> 27:05.338
But congratulations.

27:06.508 --> 27:09.442
Your child is now pure of intent

27:09.477 --> 27:12.111
and heroic of spirit.

27:12.147 --> 27:15.715
It is now up to the two
of you to guide it...

27:15.750 --> 27:18.418
And keep it in the light.

27:27.362 --> 27:30.697
We told Maleficent we
would bring back her child.

27:30.732 --> 27:33.600
And now it...

27:33.635 --> 27:35.034
Snow, we didn't know that

27:35.070 --> 27:38.638
they were gonna send
that egg to another land.

27:40.342 --> 27:44.611
Charming, we've made a terrible mistake.

27:53.188 --> 27:55.688
We have to do it.

27:55.724 --> 27:59.025
What are we going to tell Henry?

27:59.060 --> 28:03.062
We tell him... the key was wrong

28:03.098 --> 28:04.898
and, uh, uh, the page disintegrated.

28:04.933 --> 28:06.933
We'll figure something out, but let's just

28:06.968 --> 28:09.736
burn it and worry about it later.

28:09.771 --> 28:12.138
More lies.

28:14.643 --> 28:19.078
I can't do this.

28:19.114 --> 28:21.581
I gave Henry that book to give him hope,

28:21.616 --> 28:23.816
and I'm gonna lie and take it away?

28:23.852 --> 28:26.586
And what about Regina?

28:26.621 --> 28:28.855
She's finally becoming a friend.

28:28.890 --> 28:33.693
I went to her for help
with Emma, with our secret.

28:33.728 --> 28:37.430
She's kept it. She's
risked her life for us.

28:37.465 --> 28:39.332
And we're gonna repay her

28:39.367 --> 28:41.701
by destroying her chance at a happy ending?

28:41.736 --> 28:43.169
Well, maybe there's another way.

28:43.204 --> 28:45.338
No, David!

28:45.373 --> 28:47.774
When Regina showed me
my heart after Cora...

28:47.809 --> 28:51.244
after I killed Cora...
My heart was dark.

28:51.279 --> 28:52.545
And Regina thought it was

28:52.580 --> 28:54.080
because of what I did to her mother.

28:54.115 --> 28:57.450
But that darkness started long ago.

28:59.688 --> 29:05.385
We... have to tell Emma the truth.

29:05.994 --> 29:11.365
Because heroes do what's
right, not what's easy.

29:27.916 --> 29:32.085
This whole time, I was right.

29:32.120 --> 29:34.354
You were lying.

29:38.326 --> 29:41.561
I wanted to believe you.

29:43.531 --> 29:45.932
I wanted to believe in you.

29:49.237 --> 29:53.806
We were just...

29:53.842 --> 29:56.476
Trying to protect you.

29:56.511 --> 29:58.811
Emma, are you all right?

29:58.847 --> 30:00.980
No.

30:01.016 --> 30:02.815
I'm not okay.

30:04.386 --> 30:06.019
I've got to go.

30:06.054 --> 30:08.454
Please, stop.

30:08.490 --> 30:10.590
I'm your mother.

30:10.625 --> 30:13.926
I don't care.

30:23.712 --> 30:26.002
Well, I say we just
slit her throat right now,

30:26.038 --> 30:27.104
- get it over with.
- No.

30:27.139 --> 30:29.506
Well, if it's too messy for you, darling,

30:29.541 --> 30:30.774
Mal can incinerate her.

30:30.809 --> 30:32.676
We're doing nothing of the sort.

30:32.711 --> 30:33.944
She'll never help us.

30:34.012 --> 30:35.278
Of course she will.

30:35.314 --> 30:38.181
She just doesn't know it yet.

30:38.217 --> 30:40.851
I'll have something that
the moment she sees it

30:40.886 --> 30:46.136
will make Regina do my bidding... Forever.

30:52.331 --> 30:54.431
Hey.

30:54.466 --> 30:58.135
I'm just gonna need some time.

30:58.170 --> 31:00.270
August is awake.

31:01.607 --> 31:03.240
Your parents are with him.

31:03.275 --> 31:05.509
- Is he...
- He's gonna be fine.

31:05.544 --> 31:09.146
Your friend... is gonna be fine.

31:16.722 --> 31:19.456
Why did my parents send you?

31:19.491 --> 31:21.324
Well, they didn't think
you'd listen to them.

31:22.761 --> 31:25.862
They were right.

31:27.566 --> 31:31.334
Get it out of here. I don't want it.

31:31.370 --> 31:33.570
What's going on?

31:33.605 --> 31:35.505
Look what Cinderella sent.

31:35.541 --> 31:37.440
Unicorns.

31:37.476 --> 31:38.942
I like uni...

31:38.977 --> 31:40.510
Corns.

31:40.546 --> 31:41.945
Sneezy, give us a minute, please.

31:45.384 --> 31:47.632
Snow, it's just a mobile.

31:47.632 --> 31:48.818
A unicorn gave me a vision,

31:48.854 --> 31:52.355
which led to us ripping
Maleficent's child away.

31:53.825 --> 31:55.192
I don't want a reminder of that

31:55.227 --> 31:57.894
literally hanging over our baby.

31:59.831 --> 32:01.231
What we did

32:01.266 --> 32:05.035
is already with me every
night when I try to sleep.

32:05.070 --> 32:07.304
- I keep hearing...
- I know.

32:07.339 --> 32:08.939
I do, too.

32:08.974 --> 32:13.610
But maybe Maleficent
deserved what happened.

32:13.645 --> 32:16.546
For all we know, she lied about
Regina having the dark curse.

32:16.582 --> 32:18.782
Regina hasn't even tried using it.

32:18.817 --> 32:20.951
Maybe her threat was just words.

32:20.986 --> 32:25.589
None of that matters. What
matters is what we did.

32:25.624 --> 32:31.027
I thought we were doing
something brave for our child,

32:31.063 --> 32:34.064
and we were brave,

32:34.099 --> 32:37.300
but we weren't kind.

32:40.005 --> 32:42.806
We were selfish.

32:42.841 --> 32:44.407
And I think...

32:44.443 --> 32:48.478
We are not heroes anymore.

32:48.513 --> 32:49.980
How do we fix it?

32:50.015 --> 32:51.414
We can't fix it.

32:51.450 --> 32:53.883
Maleficent's child is gone.

32:53.919 --> 32:56.286
But, Snow, we're still here.

32:56.321 --> 32:59.155
So, how do we fix us?

32:59.191 --> 33:01.625
The people we are now,
weighed down by all this...

33:01.660 --> 33:03.593
is that who we want to raise our child?

33:03.629 --> 33:06.930
Of course not.

33:06.965 --> 33:10.767
But do you really think
that redemption is possible?

33:12.371 --> 33:15.071
Yes.

33:15.107 --> 33:19.409
I have to believe we can earn forgiveness.

33:19.444 --> 33:21.678
A chance at Grace.

33:24.016 --> 33:26.416
But to get there,

33:26.451 --> 33:29.452
we have to be the
best people we can...

33:29.488 --> 33:31.755
work, spread hope and faith every day.

33:31.790 --> 33:35.492
Because otherwise, what we
did will stain us forever.

33:35.527 --> 33:38.328
And affect our child.

33:38.363 --> 33:42.599
The very person we fought so hard to save.

33:44.636 --> 33:48.471
Maybe these unicorns are a good thing.

33:48.507 --> 33:50.240
Maybe they're here to remind us

33:50.275 --> 33:52.976
how easy it can be to lose our way.

33:53.011 --> 33:54.611
And as long as we have each other,

33:54.646 --> 33:57.814
we can be the best versions of ourselves.

33:59.685 --> 34:03.186
It won't happen overnight.

34:05.257 --> 34:08.391
But we can take the long, hard path.

34:13.165 --> 34:14.464
Mm.

34:25.877 --> 34:30.413
Now that you're so confident
Regina's taken care of,

34:30.449 --> 34:33.483
isn't time we took care of my needs?

34:35.487 --> 34:38.455
You didn't get me the page.

34:38.489 --> 34:40.523
You didn't earn your answer.

34:40.559 --> 34:41.958
That was the deal.

34:41.993 --> 34:45.161
That was the deal.

34:45.197 --> 34:47.063
But after all I've been through,

34:47.099 --> 34:49.666
I've more than earned my answer.

34:49.701 --> 34:53.002
I know.

34:53.038 --> 34:56.172
And I want to give you a last chance

34:56.208 --> 34:58.541
to preserve what you have.

34:59.845 --> 35:03.279
What I have is pain.

35:07.119 --> 35:09.986
And pain fades...

35:10.021 --> 35:12.889
Unless you feed it.

35:12.924 --> 35:15.825
And this...

35:15.861 --> 35:20.256
This could be the meal,
you really don't want.

35:23.135 --> 35:27.137
Well, I've never seen my child.

35:27.172 --> 35:32.375
I don't even know what
I had... a boy, a girl.

35:32.411 --> 35:35.578
I don't care how much it
hurts to know its fate.

35:35.614 --> 35:38.448
I need this.

35:48.760 --> 35:50.193
Now, remember,

35:50.228 --> 35:52.228
this was 30 years ago...

36:01.039 --> 36:02.472
Congratulations.

36:02.507 --> 36:06.242
Your adoption is finalized.

36:06.278 --> 36:08.144
She's all yours.

36:11.416 --> 36:13.116
What will you name her?

36:13.151 --> 36:15.218
Lilith.

36:17.055 --> 36:19.956
We want to name her Lily.

36:29.434 --> 36:30.667
She's alive.

36:33.138 --> 36:34.771
And...

36:34.806 --> 36:37.340
In this world.

36:37.375 --> 36:40.410
I must find her.

36:40.445 --> 36:42.846
There has to be a way.

36:42.881 --> 36:46.216
If she's out there...

36:46.251 --> 36:49.352
Someone must know her.

36:49.387 --> 36:51.187
August!

36:54.993 --> 36:56.259
How are you?

36:56.294 --> 36:58.428
A bit tired, but better.

37:00.732 --> 37:02.365
Something's wrong. How are you?

37:02.400 --> 37:03.433
I'm fine.

37:03.468 --> 37:05.902
You forget I know lying.

37:05.937 --> 37:07.504
It's a long story.

37:07.539 --> 37:08.972
It's not really worth
getting into right now,

37:09.007 --> 37:10.373
especially when I have
a surprise for you.

37:10.408 --> 37:12.642
Look what Henry found.

37:12.677 --> 37:14.978
You did it.

37:15.013 --> 37:16.412
That's right. Now, what do you say

37:16.448 --> 37:18.615
we let out The Author
I have some questions.

37:18.650 --> 37:22.285
Emma, please, think about this.

37:22.320 --> 37:24.554
This isn't just what Regina wanted.

37:24.589 --> 37:25.855
This is what Gold wanted, too.

37:25.891 --> 37:27.290
He was doing it to turn you dark.

37:27.325 --> 37:28.858
I'm not worried about it. Are you?

37:32.130 --> 37:35.131
'Cause now I have some questions about me,

37:35.166 --> 37:36.866
and he can tell us everything.

37:36.902 --> 37:38.801
If he's the one who wrote your story.

37:38.837 --> 37:40.837
What are you talking about?

37:40.872 --> 37:43.873
Something you need to
know about this author...

37:43.909 --> 37:46.376
He wasn't the only one.

37:46.411 --> 37:49.646
There have been many
authors throughout time.

37:49.681 --> 37:51.915
It's a job, not a person.

37:51.950 --> 37:54.717
And the one trapped in here was just

37:54.753 --> 37:58.788
the last tasked with
the great responsibility.

37:58.823 --> 37:59.923
Which is?

37:59.958 --> 38:02.158
To record...

38:02.193 --> 38:05.061
to witness the greatest stories of all time

38:05.096 --> 38:07.964
and record them for posterity.

38:07.999 --> 38:10.900
The job has gone back eons,

38:10.936 --> 38:15.104
from the man who watched
shadows dance across cave walls

38:15.140 --> 38:17.040
and developed an entire philosophy,

38:17.075 --> 38:20.043
to playwrights who tell tales in poetry,

38:20.078 --> 38:22.312
to a man named Walt.

38:22.347 --> 38:26.549
Many have had
this sacred job...

38:26.585 --> 38:29.852
great women and men who
took on the responsibility

38:29.888 --> 38:32.822
with the gravity that it deserved...

38:32.857 --> 38:35.024
Until this last one.

38:35.060 --> 38:39.095
He started to manipulate
rather than record.

38:39.130 --> 38:43.466
He did something... I
don't know exactly what...

38:43.501 --> 38:47.303
but something that
pushed them over the edge.

38:47.339 --> 38:48.938
How dare you?

38:48.974 --> 38:52.041
How dare you force me
to do that to that child?

38:52.077 --> 38:53.977
It makes for a better story.

38:54.012 --> 38:58.081
Return the quill. You are
ill-suited for this job.

38:58.116 --> 39:00.350
You have abused all the rules.

39:00.385 --> 39:03.019
You have lied. You have deceived us.

39:03.054 --> 39:05.622
You have forsaken your holy duty,

39:05.657 --> 39:07.857
and now...

39:07.892 --> 39:10.827
You must be punished.

39:14.232 --> 39:18.801
That's why The Sorcerer and his apprentice

39:18.837 --> 39:20.103
put him in there.

39:20.138 --> 39:22.872
They're the ones who choose The Author,

39:22.907 --> 39:24.774
and they took responsibility
for their error.

39:24.809 --> 39:29.145
If they did, and he's still in there,

39:29.180 --> 39:31.881
he still has the ability to alter the book,

39:31.916 --> 39:34.817
to alter the course of things.

39:34.853 --> 39:37.887
You sure have come a long way

39:37.922 --> 39:40.657
from the woman who wouldn't believe.

39:40.692 --> 39:44.193
Yeah. I have.

40:06.217 --> 40:08.084
Oh!

40:08.119 --> 40:10.420
Whoo!

40:10.455 --> 40:12.689
Oh.

40:12.724 --> 40:14.991
It was cramped in there!

40:15.026 --> 40:19.062
I couldn't even reach this.

40:19.097 --> 40:20.496
And I was parched.

40:20.532 --> 40:21.597
Where did you get that?

40:21.633 --> 40:23.900
This?

40:23.935 --> 40:27.003
Uh, a nice young couple I
met on the road gave it to me.

40:27.038 --> 40:28.671
You want some?

40:28.707 --> 40:30.907
- Sort of nutmeg-y.
- You.

40:32.043 --> 40:36.179
You are... are The Author?

40:36.214 --> 40:38.047
The peddler?

40:40.485 --> 40:43.653
We have a lot of questions.

40:46.024 --> 40:47.824
I bet you do.

40:51.563 --> 40:52.795
