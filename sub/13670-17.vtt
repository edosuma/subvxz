# FATS WALLER: Ain't Misbehavin'

03:46.120 --> 03:50.120
Father McCabe.

03:51.680 --> 03:52.840
Father.

03:52.840 --> 03:55.120
Sister Agnes Claire.
 I thought you'd be with the others

03:55.120 --> 03:56.440
preparing for the
               dedication ceremony.

03:56.440 --> 03:58.800
preparing for the
               dedication ceremony.
Monsignor Senti is quite upset.

03:58.800 --> 04:00.760
This music is blaring
through the building.

04:00.760 --> 04:02.880
I've piped it through
the public address system.

04:02.880 --> 04:06.880
"Make a joyful noise to the Lord
with songs, cymbals and trumpets!"

04:06.920 --> 04:09.480
Because
   despite this blasted depression,

04:09.480 --> 04:12.440
in a neighbourhood that's known
nothing but despair for years,

04:12.440 --> 04:15.360
we've built a hospital, St Eligius.

04:15.360 --> 04:16.959
And look around you!

04:16.959 --> 04:20.240
How can we not revel in
    this achievement, this miracle?

04:20.240 --> 04:24.240
Sister, today,
I could wrestle with the devil
     himself. Instead, let's dance.

04:25.080 --> 04:26.240
Oh, no. Father McCabe.

04:26.240 --> 04:28.320
Oh, no. Father McCabe.
Sister, you should get out more.

04:28.320 --> 04:32.320
Loosen up.

04:32.920 --> 04:35.240
                          Monsignor.

04:35.240 --> 04:39.000
(LAUGHS) Would you care
     to listen with me?

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
You should hear him play When The
Saints Go Marching In. That's grand.

04:43.120 --> 04:47.120
Guests are starting
to arrive for the dedication.

04:47.240 --> 04:51.240
Turn off the radio, Joseph.

04:54.080 --> 04:58.080
# There'll be swinging, swaying,
 records playing

04:59.080 --> 05:02.600
# Dancing in the street... #

05:02.600 --> 05:06.440
St Eligius' 50th anniversary
   and a party to boot.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.880
# As you are there

05:08.880 --> 05:10.840
# Come on, everybody... #

05:10.840 --> 05:14.840
Have you had any
dizziness or blurred vision?

05:15.040 --> 05:15.680
No.

05:15.680 --> 05:18.280
No.
Terry got sick all over
my blue suede shoes.

05:18.280 --> 05:21.240
Not exemplary behaviour for the
principal of an elementary school.

05:21.240 --> 05:23.760
I've had this headache
             for the last two days

05:23.760 --> 05:25.880
and the pain keeps getting worse.

05:25.880 --> 05:28.680
At first, I thought it was that I
 kept catching the sixth grade boys

05:28.680 --> 05:30.400
peeking in the girl's room.

05:30.400 --> 05:31.680
Have you had a fever?

05:31.680 --> 05:33.440
Yeah. It was 103 this morning.

05:33.440 --> 05:34.920
What d'you think's wrong?

05:34.920 --> 05:38.920
It could be anything from a flu
virus to neurological dysfunction.

05:39.240 --> 05:41.520
Like what? Like a brain tumour?

05:41.520 --> 05:44.240
Hon, it's not a brain tumour.

05:44.240 --> 05:48.240
I, er... I would like to
have you admitted for tests.

05:48.640 --> 05:52.640
I've got my Peganza Tigers
going up against the
         Polar Bear Raiders tonight

05:52.720 --> 05:54.200
in the pee-wee hockey play-offs.

05:54.200 --> 05:57.480
Terence, for once think of
yourself and not all those kids.

05:57.480 --> 05:58.960
Commuter plane went down.
Jump in, Jack.

05:58.960 --> 06:00.280
Commuter plane went down.
Jump in, Jack.
                         In a flash.

06:00.280 --> 06:02.760
   Would you do a CBC on Mr O'Casey?

06:02.760 --> 06:05.280
I'll get you to as soon as I can.

06:05.280 --> 06:09.240
     Over here, with this one.

06:09.240 --> 06:12.000
How does someone
     get used to seeing this?

06:12.000 --> 06:14.480
You don't.

06:14.480 --> 06:17.440
I really appreciate you
giving up your lunch hour.

06:17.440 --> 06:21.320
Some people couldn't care less,
 but the Historical Society

06:21.320 --> 06:24.200
is putting together
 a perspective on this hospital.

06:24.200 --> 06:28.200
It's not every day that St Eligius
celebrates its 50th anniversary.

06:28.200 --> 06:32.200
Do you mind
          if I use a tape recorder?

06:33.840 --> 06:35.840
When did you arrive at St Eligius?

06:35.840 --> 06:37.240
1965.

06:37.240 --> 06:40.360
I was Mrs Eisenberg then,
a newly-wed,

06:40.360 --> 06:44.360
and this emergency room
was just being built.

06:52.160 --> 06:56.160
Excuse me, chaps. Do you know
where the Director of Nursing is?

06:56.640 --> 06:58.200
I'm reporting for work.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.920
Nurse Nyquist's office
has been relocated

07:00.920 --> 07:04.920
to the other end of the hall,
but she's never there.
I suggest you wait in Admissions.

07:05.640 --> 07:06.760
It's that way.

07:06.760 --> 07:10.760
Thanks ever so much.

07:11.040 --> 07:14.400
Nice legs.

07:14.400 --> 07:17.560
Donald, our new ER is going
to have all the latest equipment -

07:17.560 --> 07:19.880
                     heart monitors,

07:19.880 --> 07:23.880
defibrillators,
portable X-ray machines.

07:24.440 --> 07:26.600
             Rowley...

07:26.600 --> 07:29.120
Don't you skimp on that insulation.

07:29.120 --> 07:31.880
You've done a wonderful job
as Chief of Services, Daniel.

07:31.880 --> 07:35.880
As the free spirits say nowadays,
I'm feeling groovy.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.840
&lt; Oh, wow. It's time. Turn it on!

07:45.840 --> 07:49.840
'The following programme is brought
to you in living colour on NBC.'

07:54.120 --> 07:57.240
And when the patients arrive
to be admitted, you stand here,

07:57.240 --> 08:01.240
take down the pertinent personal
information and smile. Can you smile?

08:01.280 --> 08:04.520
Oh, come on, Nurse Eisenberg,
you can do better than that.

08:04.520 --> 08:06.960
You won't last a day
around here, limey.

08:06.960 --> 08:09.560
I'm just used to
a tad more responsibility.

08:09.560 --> 08:13.520
All my nurses start out in
Admissions and work their way up
or out that front door.

08:13.520 --> 08:15.560
PHONE RINGS

08:15.560 --> 08:17.080
St Elishius.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.280
                          Eligius! &gt;

08:18.280 --> 08:20.880
Er, Eligius... Sorry. Hello.

08:20.880 --> 08:24.880
Hello?

08:39.640 --> 08:41.120
What's your name?

08:41.120 --> 08:42.159
What's your name?
Luther.

08:42.159 --> 08:44.880
Mine's Helen. What's the matter?

08:44.880 --> 08:46.160
I miss my mommy.

08:46.160 --> 08:47.560
Where is your mommy?

08:47.560 --> 08:49.720
Upstairs working.

08:49.720 --> 08:51.280
Oh, that's nothing.

08:51.280 --> 08:54.920
My mum's much further away
than that. My mum's in England.

08:54.920 --> 08:56.280
Do you miss her?

08:56.280 --> 08:58.760
Yes, I do, quite a bit.

08:58.760 --> 08:59.600
Why'd you leave?

08:59.600 --> 09:01.360
Why'd you leave?
Oh, because I got married

09:01.360 --> 09:03.160
and my husband wanted me
to come to America.

09:03.160 --> 09:06.680
and my husband wanted me
to come to America.
Are you ever going back home?

09:06.680 --> 09:10.280
No, I don't think so.

09:10.280 --> 09:13.440
You know what you need, Luther?
You need a sweetie.

09:13.440 --> 09:17.440
And I just happen
to have one in my purse.

09:18.160 --> 09:22.160
There...
let's sit up here for a minute.

09:25.760 --> 09:28.160
Hello, Mark. It's great to see you.

09:28.160 --> 09:30.760
Wow. Over the past 10 years,
you've put on some pounds.

09:30.760 --> 09:34.760
Lost a little turf up top, huh?

09:37.400 --> 09:39.040
Daniel asked me to drop by.

09:39.040 --> 09:41.520
Now that Dr Domedion's retired,

09:41.520 --> 09:44.200
St Eligius is in the market
for a new chief of surgery.

09:44.200 --> 09:46.000
  I remember when we were residents,

09:46.000 --> 09:47.720
you said you'd never come back here
to work. You promised.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.120
you said you'd never come back here
to work. You promised.
Yeah, well...

09:49.120 --> 09:53.120
The Democrats said they wouldn't
go for Medicare. That Texan, LBJ.

09:53.200 --> 09:57.200
Expect anything from anyone
whose wife's name is Ladybird.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.120
Next car.

10:00.120 --> 10:03.800
And get a haircut, Mary.

10:03.800 --> 10:06.280
I understand you have a wife now.

10:06.280 --> 10:09.920
That's good.
Frankly, I was beginning to wonder.

10:09.920 --> 10:12.680
Where did you meet Mrs Westphall?

10:12.680 --> 10:15.120
She had the lead
in Kiss Me Kate at Emerson.

10:15.120 --> 10:17.200
         After the last performance,

10:17.200 --> 10:21.200
I finally got enough nerve
to go backstage.

10:21.200 --> 10:24.880
I hate the theatre.
Saw Neil Simon's The Odd Couple.

10:24.880 --> 10:26.880
It would have been funnier
with two women.

10:26.880 --> 10:29.600
Nobody's done anything
about these lousy clocks.

10:29.600 --> 10:30.360
                                 No.

10:30.360 --> 10:32.280
                                 No.
So, Donald, any kids?

10:32.280 --> 10:33.760
Yeah. A daughter, Elizabeth.

10:33.760 --> 10:37.240
Congratulations. My son
   Stephen is nine. Just yesterday,

10:37.240 --> 10:40.720
Ellen took the training wheels
off his bike. I tried
     to teach him how to ride.

10:40.720 --> 10:43.400
The kid has no
co-ordination whatsoever.

10:43.400 --> 10:44.480
      I'd love to have a son.

10:44.480 --> 10:46.400
      I'd love to have a son.
Yes, Edgar?

10:46.400 --> 10:48.440
Yes, dinner will be ready.

10:48.440 --> 10:51.240
I'll make it as soon as I get home.

10:51.240 --> 10:54.520
Edgar, I am trying
                 to be a good wife.

10:54.520 --> 10:55.960
(COUGHS)

10:55.960 --> 10:58.360
Perhaps we'd better
talk about this later.

10:58.360 --> 11:00.280
Ta-ta for now.

11:00.280 --> 11:03.320
Excuse me, man.
My friend isn't feeling too good.

11:03.320 --> 11:06.480
Can you help? He's right over here.
I met him last night in Cambridge

11:06.480 --> 11:08.600
at a welcome back party
for Professor Leary

11:08.600 --> 11:11.840
and the karma was right,
we got it on, but he hasn't
been the same ever since.

11:11.840 --> 11:12.200
                    What's his name?

11:12.200 --> 11:16.200
                    What's his name?
Terence O'Casey.
Terry, this man is a doctor.

11:16.880 --> 11:19.440
I'd shake hands with a white rabbit

11:19.440 --> 11:21.200
but I'm not sure
   I'd get all my fingers back.

11:21.200 --> 11:22.920
but I'm not sure
   I'd get all my fingers back.
                  I beg your pardon?

11:22.920 --> 11:24.760
Wow.

11:24.760 --> 11:28.440
Your face is melting.

11:28.440 --> 11:31.360
Don't touch me!

11:31.360 --> 11:33.080
All his energy, it's...

11:33.080 --> 11:35.360
and the colours...

11:35.360 --> 11:39.280
and the laughing...

11:39.280 --> 11:40.840
Oh! Oh!

11:40.840 --> 11:44.080
You know, if this is what life...

11:44.080 --> 11:45.720
life is about,

11:45.720 --> 11:49.720
then John and Paul and Ringo,
they said... No!

11:53.160 --> 11:55.120
I can't get no satisfaction.

11:55.120 --> 11:56.600
Hold my hand, here.

11:56.600 --> 12:00.600
No! I can't get no satisfaction,
satisfaction, satis...

12:02.360 --> 12:05.960
Satisfaction! Satisfaction!

12:05.960 --> 12:07.880
       Nurse, this man is psychotic.

12:07.880 --> 12:11.240
Get him into a straitjacket and
up into a padded cell immediately.

12:11.240 --> 12:13.040
I think I can help. Will you let me?

12:13.040 --> 12:15.480
Nurse, get this man into psych.
Now!

12:15.480 --> 12:17.600
Head 'em up and move 'em out...

12:17.600 --> 12:20.280
Rawhide!

12:20.280 --> 12:22.600
Rawhide! Yee-ha!

12:22.600 --> 12:26.600
Come on, horsey.
Hi-ho, Silver! Away!

12:26.680 --> 12:28.880
What's your father's name?

12:28.880 --> 12:30.000
Patrick.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.480
Is he alive?

12:31.480 --> 12:33.440
No. Bum ticker.

12:33.440 --> 12:34.880
Mother's name.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.880
Alison Gladden O'Casey.

12:36.880 --> 12:39.240
Alison Gladden.

12:39.240 --> 12:40.560
How's her health?

12:40.560 --> 12:44.360
I wouldn't know.
Haven't seen her since
the Dodgers won their first series.

12:44.360 --> 12:45.960
Brothers and sisters?

12:45.960 --> 12:49.720
A sister, Sarah,
      but she died when she was 13.

12:49.720 --> 12:53.720
My parents never told me why.

12:56.360 --> 12:58.920
Last time we were at St Eligius,
   Linda gave me a son.

12:58.920 --> 13:00.200
He's our only child.

13:00.200 --> 13:02.720
My wife gave birth
to our son here, too.

13:02.720 --> 13:05.600
We were in labour for 22 hours.
Linda and I, we worked together.

13:05.600 --> 13:09.600
It was Le Mars.
Pretty radical back in '66.

13:09.720 --> 13:13.720
We felt so cool. I even got to cut
the umbilical cord and everything.

13:14.360 --> 13:17.680
It was early on a Monday morning
 Kevin was born.

13:17.680 --> 13:20.080
I remember because I was
driving home to grab a nap,

13:20.080 --> 13:23.480
adrenalin still pumping,
singing, crazy out of my mind.

13:23.480 --> 13:26.840
This cop pulls me over
over on Storrow Drive.

13:26.840 --> 13:29.040
I must have been doing about 90.

13:29.040 --> 13:31.600
But I hop out of the car,
          I hop up on the hood

13:31.600 --> 13:34.000
and I shout to this cop,
    "You're not giving me a ticket.

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
"Not today, man. Because today
is the greatest day of my life."

13:38.680 --> 13:40.080
He let you off?

13:40.080 --> 13:43.920
No, not a bet. Didn't matter.

13:43.920 --> 13:45.840
Listen, Doc,
          can I ask you a question?

13:45.840 --> 13:47.080
Listen, Doc,
          can I ask you a question?
Yep.

13:47.080 --> 13:49.560
Do you think what's
wrong with me is serious?

13:49.560 --> 13:51.560
It's too early to tell.
Hop onto the bed

13:51.560 --> 13:55.560
and we'll finish the exam.

13:55.720 --> 13:56.840
I can't move my legs!

13:56.840 --> 13:58.640
All right, don't panic.

13:58.640 --> 14:00.600
No, I can't move 'em!

14:00.600 --> 14:04.600
                         OK, just...

14:04.880 --> 14:08.880
BRASS BAND PLAY

14:14.800 --> 14:18.800
Thank you.
Thank you, St Ursula's Band.

14:19.680 --> 14:23.680
At this time, I'd like to introduce
a man who needs no introduction

14:23.760 --> 14:27.320
but will need a lot of money to
run this fine, new institution.

14:27.320 --> 14:29.720
The founder and chief administrator

14:29.720 --> 14:32.480
of St Eligius Hospital,
God's right arm...

14:32.480 --> 14:36.480
Father Joseph McCabe.

14:41.280 --> 14:43.640
    Your Eminence, Your Honour,

14:43.640 --> 14:47.280
distinguished guests,
friends, neighbours...

14:47.280 --> 14:50.200
         Is this thing on?

14:50.200 --> 14:52.200
  Well, the struggle's been hard.

14:52.200 --> 14:53.880
            But, today,

14:53.880 --> 14:57.880
we open the doors on
a new era in this community.

14:58.320 --> 15:02.040
No longer will fear and disease live
in the dark corners

15:02.040 --> 15:06.040
of musty tenements. St Eligius
represents a cornerstone

15:06.720 --> 15:10.720
upon which a new prosperity
will be built, a new spirit...

15:11.920 --> 15:13.800
FEEDBACK

15:13.800 --> 15:17.800
This structure will be more
than just mortar and bricks.

15:20.080 --> 15:22.840
     But a place of compassion

15:22.840 --> 15:26.840
  and comfort for the suffering.

15:28.320 --> 15:32.320
Thanks to all of you who've
helped to make this dream come true.

15:34.440 --> 15:38.440
And for those of you who didn't...

15:38.920 --> 15:41.280
   ..I have one word of advice.

15:41.280 --> 15:45.280
Don't come near my confessional
because there'll be hell to pay!

15:46.240 --> 15:50.240
LAUGHTER

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
BAND PLAY

16:26.800 --> 16:29.880
Dr Morrison, where have you been?

16:29.880 --> 16:31.760
Day Care. My son.
I had to pick him up.

16:31.760 --> 16:34.840
The nurse won't let me
go upstairs till visiting hours.
   How's my husband?

16:34.840 --> 16:36.720
The nurse won't let me
go upstairs till visiting hours.
   How's my husband?
Well... He can't move his legs.

16:36.720 --> 16:38.280
What?!

16:38.280 --> 16:42.280
For now. But his fever's
responding to the antibiotics.

16:42.320 --> 16:43.600
What the hell is wrong with him?

16:43.600 --> 16:44.840
What the hell is wrong with him?
I don't know yet.

16:44.840 --> 16:46.160
Should I contact our son?

16:46.160 --> 16:49.920
I don't wanna bother him unless it's
serious. They aren't getting along.

16:49.920 --> 16:53.920
             Call him.

16:59.480 --> 17:00.520
            Oh, Phil...

17:00.520 --> 17:02.760
I know, I know.
You want another kerbside.

17:02.760 --> 17:05.680
I'm gonna start taking
  a  commission on your patients.

17:05.680 --> 17:08.960
No, no, no. I'm on top of this one.
I'm just not sure.

17:08.960 --> 17:10.000
What do you have?

17:10.000 --> 17:12.839
A 40-year-old white male
who presented earlier today

17:12.839 --> 17:16.520
with severe headaches,
stiff neck, nausea...

17:16.520 --> 17:18.520
Now he's got partial paralysis.

17:18.520 --> 17:20.560
What's your diagnosis?

17:20.560 --> 17:21.880
Aseptic meningitis.

17:21.880 --> 17:24.240
Eh, wrong. That intern,

17:24.240 --> 17:26.640
he just had a patient
with it, the astronaut.

17:26.640 --> 17:29.240
Come on Jack, you gotta
think horses, not zebras.

17:29.240 --> 17:31.560
  Mr O'Casey's fever went to 103.

17:31.560 --> 17:35.560
OK, give him a spinal tap, give
him a CAT scan and give me a break.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.200
Oh, oh...

17:38.200 --> 17:41.440
If you're on a break, would you take
my little friend Pete here

17:41.440 --> 17:43.800
up to Susie in accounting?

17:43.800 --> 17:47.800
Sure. What else you gonna ask me to
do, massage your prostate? Come on.

17:55.880 --> 17:58.360
One more question. Father living?

17:58.360 --> 17:59.480
                                Dead.

17:59.480 --> 18:01.640
No, he's not.

18:01.640 --> 18:03.960
                      Maybe I'm dead.

18:03.960 --> 18:05.440
Mr O'Casey...

18:05.440 --> 18:09.440
Don't you ever try that again!
I know you're after me, all of you.

18:09.480 --> 18:12.160
No-one is here to hurt  you,
   I promise you that.

18:12.160 --> 18:13.760
I came to see  how
Mr O'Casey's doing.

18:13.760 --> 18:17.760
I came to see  how
Mr O'Casey's doing.
             Oh no...

18:19.600 --> 18:22.640
       I'm getting smaller.

18:22.640 --> 18:24.960
 I stopped growing and now I'm...

18:24.960 --> 18:26.920
            shrinking.

18:26.920 --> 18:28.080
        Put that gun away!

18:28.080 --> 18:30.040
Let me help him.

18:30.040 --> 18:31.680
             Go away!

18:31.680 --> 18:33.480
All right. It's all right.

18:33.480 --> 18:36.080
Everything is all right.
You're going to be fine.

18:36.080 --> 18:38.200
You're going to be fine.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.680
             I shrunk.

18:39.680 --> 18:41.720
No, you're crouching in a corner.

18:41.720 --> 18:45.240
And you're in a hospital.

18:45.240 --> 18:49.240
Do you remember taking the acid?

18:50.080 --> 18:53.360
               Yes.

18:53.360 --> 18:55.520
     Somebody cut my arms off.

18:55.520 --> 18:59.120
You're in a straitjacket.

18:59.120 --> 19:00.920
Mr O'Casey,

19:00.920 --> 19:04.880
I'd like to take care of you -
if you'll let me?

19:04.880 --> 19:08.880
I'm your friend.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.040
             Help me.

19:12.040 --> 19:15.480
I will.

19:15.480 --> 19:19.480
How is it possible that
this  hospital is falling apart when

19:20.040 --> 19:24.040
the rest of Boston is undergoing
a tremendous revitalisation?

19:24.040 --> 19:27.640
In fact, this whole neighbourhood
reminds me of Flushing Meadow -

19:27.640 --> 19:28.960
before the World's Fair.

19:28.960 --> 19:31.960
Did you notice they tore down
the tenements in Flannery's pub?

19:31.960 --> 19:35.560
Of course. You call that renovation.
That's demolition.

19:35.560 --> 19:37.400
    They're putting in a park.

19:37.400 --> 19:41.400
Daniel,
let's get down to the nitty gritty.

19:41.920 --> 19:44.400
It would be a great coup
for St Eligus

19:44.400 --> 19:46.720
to claim you as
its own chief of surgery.

19:46.720 --> 19:50.720
Of course it would. But first,
here are my final conditions.

19:50.880 --> 19:53.680
Complete charge of the OR
   from who scrubs for surgery

19:53.680 --> 19:54.960
to  who scrubs the floor.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.080
            Absolutely.

19:56.080 --> 19:59.240
The most sophisticated
up-to-date cardiac  care equipment

19:59.240 --> 20:00.280
at my disposal.

20:00.280 --> 20:01.960
             Possibly.

20:01.960 --> 20:05.960
And the same salary I am presently
receiving at Boston General.

20:06.040 --> 20:08.640
           Not a chance.

20:08.640 --> 20:10.640
OK, let's forget the whole thing.

20:10.640 --> 20:13.320
Camp Runamuck
   runs better than this place.

20:13.320 --> 20:15.000
             You're absolutely right.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.440
There's no reason for
you to come back here.

20:17.440 --> 20:20.840
Even though it was Dr Domidion's wish
that you succeed him.

20:20.840 --> 20:22.560
 When you left it broke his heart.

20:22.560 --> 20:24.560
Spare me.

20:24.560 --> 20:28.560
Certainly. There is no
possible way I can persuade you.

20:29.640 --> 20:31.440
So...

20:31.440 --> 20:33.480
you just return to Boston General.

20:33.480 --> 20:37.480
And I hope you enjoy working under
their newly-named chief of surgery,

20:38.160 --> 20:42.040
Josiah Bartlett.

20:42.040 --> 20:46.040
I deserved that appointment.

20:47.080 --> 20:51.080
They have a very
political climate over there.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.400
We could have a better surgical
department than Boston General.

20:55.400 --> 20:58.280
They practice department
store medicine over there.

20:58.280 --> 21:02.280
I need to know I'll make
the difference, Daniel.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.640
And if there's anywhere that
people need help, it's here.

21:07.640 --> 21:11.240
Welcome home.

21:11.240 --> 21:15.240
Can you guarantee me at  least
       my own parking space?

21:28.840 --> 21:31.240
This anniversary
    celebration's a big deal?

21:31.240 --> 21:34.160
It doesn't matter what you wear
as long as you are there.

21:34.160 --> 21:37.640
I'll go inside,
see if the technician's ready...

21:37.640 --> 21:41.240
to do the CAT scan.

21:41.240 --> 21:42.600
Gary...

21:42.600 --> 21:44.200
Kevin's here.

21:44.200 --> 21:46.120
To borrow your mascara?

21:46.120 --> 21:48.800
He's your son.
You could at least meet him halfway.

21:48.800 --> 21:51.160
I may never walk again.
     You'll excuse me if

21:51.160 --> 21:55.160
I'm not interested in him
  or  his feelings at the moment.

21:57.280 --> 21:59.200
No-one's there.

21:59.200 --> 22:01.160
We had an appointment.

22:01.160 --> 22:02.680
I'll go check the office.

22:02.680 --> 22:06.680
                                 Dad?

22:08.040 --> 22:09.480
I came by cos I'm concerned.

22:09.480 --> 22:11.040
All right, you're concerned.

22:11.040 --> 22:12.560
How are you feeling?

22:12.560 --> 22:14.920
I'm in a lot of pain.

22:14.920 --> 22:18.920
Is there anything I can do?

22:20.000 --> 22:23.200
It's funny that you
wait till now to ask.

22:23.200 --> 22:27.120
Fine. I'll see you
in another two years.

22:27.120 --> 22:28.400
He's out to lunch.

22:28.400 --> 22:29.800
You're telling me.

22:29.800 --> 22:32.040
No, I mean the CAT scan technician.

22:32.040 --> 22:34.720
Don't mean to keep you waiting.

22:34.720 --> 22:35.760
Bored?

22:35.760 --> 22:38.200
          Bored? No way!

22:38.200 --> 22:42.200
I'll go call him.

22:43.880 --> 22:45.800
I'm sorry you saw that.

22:45.800 --> 22:47.120
                          No problem.

22:47.120 --> 22:48.920
You get along with your father?

22:48.920 --> 22:50.880
                      Don't have one.

22:50.880 --> 22:54.880
It's my fault that Kevin
turned out the way he did.

22:56.120 --> 22:58.720
Get me out of here,
bring me back to my room.

22:58.720 --> 23:02.720
        Whatever you say, Mr O'Casey.

23:30.400 --> 23:34.400
Forgive me father,
for I have sinned.

23:34.560 --> 23:35.720
      My son, this can wait.

23:35.720 --> 23:38.360
No! No, you came to this
bathroom for a reason.

23:38.360 --> 23:42.360
God lead you here to
hear my confession.

23:42.920 --> 23:45.880
I'm listening.
How have you sinned?

23:45.880 --> 23:47.480
When my wife was young

23:47.480 --> 23:50.200
she had rheumatic fever
and  it damaged her heart.

23:50.200 --> 23:52.920
The doctors warned us she
shouldn't get pregnant as

23:52.920 --> 23:56.920
the strain of childbirth would be
too much for her, she could die.

23:58.880 --> 24:02.880
I use condoms when
I make love to her.

24:03.640 --> 24:06.560
                            My son...

24:06.560 --> 24:10.360
God has given Anna to you
and you to Anna

24:10.360 --> 24:13.960
so that you can live
together as husband and wife.

24:13.960 --> 24:17.840
But God has also given you ways,
through science and medicine,

24:17.840 --> 24:19.760
to express your love for one another.

24:19.760 --> 24:21.440
What about the church teaching?

24:21.440 --> 24:24.120
I cannot absolve you from your guilt.

24:24.120 --> 24:27.760
But I will tell you
to search your heart.

24:27.760 --> 24:31.760
         Pray, and ask for direction.

24:32.600 --> 24:33.640
Thank you, Father.

24:33.640 --> 24:37.040
I haven't absolved you,
but go in peace.

24:37.040 --> 24:41.040
Thank you, Father.

24:52.600 --> 24:55.240
Morrison,
I bumped you from the board.

24:55.240 --> 24:58.480
Whose  taffy are you
      trying to pull anyway?

24:58.480 --> 25:02.480
Only a moron would schedule the
procedure room for a two bit spinal.

25:02.600 --> 25:03.480
Mr O'Casey...

25:03.480 --> 25:04.760
Mr O'Casey...
Can it!

25:04.760 --> 25:07.560
Give your patient a spinal
in his room or the hallway,

25:07.560 --> 25:08.720
anywhere but near me.

25:08.720 --> 25:10.040
I thought that spinal...

25:10.040 --> 25:12.200
That's your problem,
you think too much.

25:12.200 --> 25:13.640
Or too little, I can't tell.

25:13.640 --> 25:17.600
Didn't you learn anything in that
burrito factory, Carlton University?

25:17.600 --> 25:21.600
Because here in El Americano we
do things with Yankee practicality.

25:23.560 --> 25:27.560
You really do belong
south of the border.

25:38.040 --> 25:39.840
     That's great, Luther, thank you.

25:39.840 --> 25:43.160
You know, I was born in St Eligius.
C section. Now I'm in Five East

25:43.160 --> 25:46.480
and I've been hanging around here
one way or another ever since.

25:46.480 --> 25:47.640
That's interesting.

25:47.640 --> 25:50.960
In case you wanted to talk
to somebody from the lower echelon.

25:50.960 --> 25:52.000
Cream?

25:52.000 --> 25:53.120
           Yeah, please.

25:53.120 --> 25:57.000
Dr Westphall, you grew up
around St Eligius, didn't you?

25:57.000 --> 26:00.960
Yes, not very far from here.
My father, he was a schoolteacher.

26:00.960 --> 26:04.240
Shandy Englishman... Thank you.
Teaching shandy Irish kids,

26:04.240 --> 26:08.080
and almost every day I'd walk home
with him, right down this street.

26:08.080 --> 26:12.080
Tell me about when you were
   named  director of medicine.

26:13.360 --> 26:15.520
                       That was 1975.

26:15.520 --> 26:16.560
Hi, Dad!

26:16.560 --> 26:17.680
                Hi!

26:17.680 --> 26:20.440
Knock first.
Your father's very busy.

26:20.440 --> 26:21.840
           She doesn't have to knock.

26:21.840 --> 26:24.360
                How did everybody do?

26:24.360 --> 26:27.520
Dr Carlyle gave Tommy and Lizzie
both a clean bill of health.

26:27.520 --> 26:30.600
Dad, the nurse said she'd give me
some candy. Can I go see her?

26:30.600 --> 26:31.800
                                Sure.

26:31.800 --> 26:35.800
Take your brother.

26:36.200 --> 26:37.440
                                  Hi!

26:37.440 --> 26:38.480
Hi!

26:38.480 --> 26:42.480
     A little lower, will you?

26:43.600 --> 26:46.920
I've been thinking...
If you can get the weekend,

26:46.920 --> 26:49.520
we can take the kids
to  visit my sister on the lake.

26:49.520 --> 26:53.000
I have a board meeting Friday,
that would mean getting a late start.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.880
Still, it'd be so great
for  us all to get out of the city.

26:55.880 --> 26:57.200
               Yeah.

26:57.200 --> 27:00.520
I'd like to get Tommy on his skates.

27:00.520 --> 27:04.360
Honey, I know we've been
putting this off,

27:04.360 --> 27:07.760
but Mary Carlyle
said we have to decide

27:07.760 --> 27:08.960
how we are going to
deal with Tommy's autism...

27:08.960 --> 27:11.280
how we are going to
deal with Tommy's autism...
   He's two. We don't know that.

27:11.280 --> 27:13.600
Nothing has happened in a year.

27:13.600 --> 27:15.800
He just sits and
stares his life away.

27:15.800 --> 27:19.640
PAGER

27:19.640 --> 27:22.280
               Yeah?

27:22.280 --> 27:25.760
I'll be right there.
I have a consult.

27:25.760 --> 27:28.240
    Let's talk about this later, huh?

27:28.240 --> 27:29.760
What do you want for dessert?

27:29.760 --> 27:30.800
            Ice cream.

27:30.800 --> 27:33.560
Would you pick it  up
on your way home?

27:33.560 --> 27:34.680
               Bye.

27:34.680 --> 27:38.680
Bye.

27:42.840 --> 27:45.600
Brooks, trim that beard.

27:45.600 --> 27:48.880
You interns are very fortunate.

27:48.880 --> 27:51.120
Not only because
you're working for me...

27:51.120 --> 27:55.120
Weinberger, can you see
through those jelly jar bottoms?

27:56.400 --> 27:58.960
But because you're the first class

27:58.960 --> 28:02.120
to have a first-class
bypass machine.

28:02.120 --> 28:06.120
You're riding the crest of the wave
of a new medical phenomenon.

28:06.400 --> 28:10.400
Allen, Burns, each grab
hold of this plastic, will you?

28:13.200 --> 28:15.160
Look at this.

28:15.160 --> 28:19.160
Custom tubing,
haemostasis filters, tachometer,

28:19.280 --> 28:22.760
membrane oxygenator.

28:22.760 --> 28:24.560
Top of the line.

28:24.560 --> 28:28.200
Technology that will carry us

28:28.200 --> 28:32.200
into the 21st century.

28:33.320 --> 28:37.320
Oh, for crying out loud!

28:40.880 --> 28:43.000
What you want me to do now, Mom?

28:43.000 --> 28:44.320
Play with your brother.

28:44.320 --> 28:46.000
He's so boring.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.120
I wish I had a sister
instead, or a pony.

28:48.120 --> 28:51.440
Besides, I have homework to do.

28:51.440 --> 28:54.600
Turn the radio off, please.

28:54.600 --> 28:55.040
                Hi.

28:55.040 --> 28:56.120
                Hi.
&lt; Hi, Daddy!

28:56.120 --> 28:59.200
Hi! &gt;

28:59.200 --> 29:02.040
Careful, lipstick.

29:02.040 --> 29:03.360
Want a cocktail?

29:03.360 --> 29:07.000
No, thanks. And you really
don't need one, either.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.520
Did you pay the fuel oil bill?

29:08.520 --> 29:12.520
No, I thought you were gonna do it.

29:13.360 --> 29:16.360
            Hi, sport.

29:16.360 --> 29:20.360
        How's my boy, huh?

29:21.800 --> 29:24.960
Can you say Daddy?

29:24.960 --> 29:28.960
Daddy?

29:30.600 --> 29:34.280
Boy, he's getting heavy, isn't he?

29:34.280 --> 29:37.280
Don't beat yourself up about this.

29:37.280 --> 29:40.800
Tommy's never gonna be the son you
imagined, but whatever it takes,

29:40.800 --> 29:44.600
we'll see that he lives as
normal a life as possible.

29:44.600 --> 29:45.880
                             Promise?

29:45.880 --> 29:47.160
We're in this together.

29:47.160 --> 29:50.720
                               Right.

29:50.720 --> 29:52.320
The drier.

29:52.320 --> 29:54.640
Don't go away.

29:54.640 --> 29:57.160
Come on, Tommy, my darling.

29:57.160 --> 30:01.160
You can help your mom, huh? Come on.

30:01.200 --> 30:04.760
Oh, honey, I bought two
theatre tickets from Dr McDuffin.

30:04.760 --> 30:06.480
      Some sort of whodunnit.

30:06.480 --> 30:07.680
That was sweet of you. &gt;

30:07.680 --> 30:11.200
 Yeah. They're for next Wednesday.

30:11.200 --> 30:13.400
The theatre, on a weekday night? &gt;

30:13.400 --> 30:15.880
  Why not? You love the theatre.

30:15.880 --> 30:17.680
You always say by the second act&gt;

30:17.680 --> 30:20.640
you feel like you're
gonna die in that chair! &gt;

30:20.640 --> 30:23.240
Donald, you work hard. &gt;

30:23.240 --> 30:27.240
You should come home, eat dinner,
   turn on the Rockford Files, &gt;

30:27.560 --> 30:30.600
slide into police woman
and call it tonight. &gt;

30:30.600 --> 30:31.840
&lt; Come here, sport.

30:31.840 --> 30:34.440
Your daddy brought home
     your  favourite dessert.

30:34.440 --> 30:36.560
    Oh, I forgot the ice cream.

30:36.560 --> 30:38.320
No, no. I'll go.

30:38.320 --> 30:41.080
You're a big-shot
director of medicine now.

30:41.080 --> 30:45.080
Stay here,  stir the stew
            every 10 minutes.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.480
And while I'm gone,
would you pay some bills?

30:49.480 --> 30:53.480
               Yes.

30:58.240 --> 30:59.440
Thank you.

30:59.440 --> 31:01.000
Hey!  O'Casey!

31:01.000 --> 31:03.520
What d'you think you're doing?

31:03.520 --> 31:05.200
           Having a late-night snack.

31:05.200 --> 31:08.560
Eat those eggs and hot  cakes
and you're a dead man.

31:08.560 --> 31:10.480
I'm hungry. Driving a bakery truck,

31:10.480 --> 31:13.920
I usually just reach in the back
and snatch something off the rack.

31:13.920 --> 31:16.200
Yeah, well, one day
your heart'll give out

31:16.200 --> 31:20.200
and they'll be scraping you
off the road. Come on over here.

31:20.440 --> 31:22.560
Damn nurse wouldn't
give me any dinner.

31:22.560 --> 31:25.640
That's because you are
being operated on in the morning.

31:25.640 --> 31:27.160
             Oh, I am?

31:27.160 --> 31:29.320
I've got the results
of your angiogram.

31:29.320 --> 31:31.960
Your cholesterol level
is hovering  around 500,

31:31.960 --> 31:34.400
your blood pressure
has gone into orbit

31:34.400 --> 31:37.680
and there are barges
of fat clogging your arteries.

31:37.680 --> 31:41.120
So I'm gonna do a coronary bypass.

31:41.120 --> 31:42.680
                         What's that?

31:42.680 --> 31:45.600
We put you on a machine
that  takes over for your heart,

31:45.600 --> 31:47.360
then we bypass the faulty artery

31:47.360 --> 31:50.160
and then we restart your heart -
ping, ping, ping.

31:50.160 --> 31:51.960
                        I don't know.

31:51.960 --> 31:53.280
I'm gonna save your life.

31:53.280 --> 31:56.000
A year ago, I couldn't have
   offered you that hope.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.320
Think of all you've got to live for.
Your son, what's his name?

31:59.320 --> 32:00.400
                             Terence.

32:00.400 --> 32:01.600
And your grandson?

32:01.600 --> 32:02.640
                               Kevin.

32:02.640 --> 32:06.200
Oh, you Irish are about
as original as a doughnut!

32:06.200 --> 32:08.440
So, do I have your
complete co-operation?

32:08.440 --> 32:09.480
                            Sir.

32:09.480 --> 32:10.520
Good.

32:10.520 --> 32:13.600
See you first thing in the morning.
You, me and the bypass machine.

32:13.600 --> 32:16.880
Doctor? How many of these
operations have you performed?

32:16.880 --> 32:20.880
You're the first - wish me luck.

32:21.200 --> 32:24.400
                Good luck.

32:24.400 --> 32:26.080
         I itch all over.

32:26.080 --> 32:29.840
You're having an allergic
reaction to the CAT scan dye.

32:29.840 --> 32:32.520
God, I can't stand this!
Would you do something, Doc?

32:32.520 --> 32:34.640
We'll give you
a shot of Benadryl.

32:34.640 --> 32:36.160
When the hell are you gonna
figure out what's wrong?

32:36.160 --> 32:40.160
When the hell are you gonna
figure out what's wrong?
I'm trying, Mr O'Casey.

32:44.840 --> 32:46.160
How's Terry?

32:46.160 --> 32:48.800
Uncomfortable.
Starting to get unpleasant.

32:48.800 --> 32:52.480
How much longer till
you know something?

32:52.480 --> 32:54.320
    The spinal tap was inconclusive,

32:54.320 --> 32:57.920
and I still haven't got a result
from the CAT scan.

32:57.920 --> 32:58.960
(SIGHS)

32:58.960 --> 33:00.920
Why don't you get
your son to take you home?

33:00.920 --> 33:04.920
Kevin left. Said he'd picked
me up in a couple of hours.
   God, I need some fresh air.

33:06.120 --> 33:10.120
I know it's none of my business,
and you can tell me so,

33:10.680 --> 33:14.440
but what is going on between
Mr O'Casey and your son?

33:14.440 --> 33:18.360
My husband comes from
     a proud Catholic family.

33:18.360 --> 33:22.320
His grandfather escaped the
potato famine, arrived in America,

33:22.320 --> 33:25.080
got a job doing pick and shovel
 work on the railroad.

33:25.080 --> 33:27.600
Terry's father Patrick
worked in the mills.

33:27.600 --> 33:31.600
After that job went south,
    he drove a bakery truck.

33:32.320 --> 33:36.320
The O'Caseys never had much to pass
on except hope and the family name.

33:37.760 --> 33:41.680
Now all that's gonna
stop with our son, Kevin.

33:41.680 --> 33:43.720
                          Why?

33:43.720 --> 33:47.720
He's homosexual.

33:51.360 --> 33:52.920
              What's that, Luther?

33:52.920 --> 33:55.920
The police wanted us to post
these missing child bulletins.

33:55.920 --> 33:57.600
Some maniac grabbed a three-year-old

33:57.600 --> 34:01.600
from right in the
middle of the common.

34:02.520 --> 34:06.520
Well, in my first year, Daniel,
as Director of Medicine,

34:07.520 --> 34:11.520
I had to sit by and watch this
neighbourhood get poorer and poorer.

34:12.159 --> 34:14.840
  Of course, hospital costs increased

34:14.840 --> 34:18.840
and no-one could afford to pay, so
St Eligius built up a huge deficit.

34:18.840 --> 34:20.880
Must have been
a traumatic time for you.

34:20.880 --> 34:21.920
           Yes, it was.

34:21.920 --> 34:24.480
When the heck are we gonna eat?

34:24.480 --> 34:28.480
Soon as your mom gets back, honey.
I don't know what's keeping her.

34:30.679 --> 34:31.239
Dad?

34:31.239 --> 34:33.280
Dad?
                              Yeah? &gt;

34:33.280 --> 34:36.000
Will I have to leave my school
and go to an all-black one?

34:36.000 --> 34:37.840
     Why would you think that?

34:37.840 --> 34:41.320
Well, the older kids are
saying we're gonna be bussed.

34:41.320 --> 34:43.280
Why would the teachers
be so mean to us?

34:43.280 --> 34:45.560
Lizzie, you can't take
this personally. &gt;

34:45.560 --> 34:48.360
This is just a partial remedy
to a very complex situation.

34:48.360 --> 34:50.080
I think it stinks.

34:50.080 --> 34:51.760
PHONE RINGS

34:51.760 --> 34:55.760
I'll get it. Probably Betty Russell.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.400
Hi.

34:58.400 --> 34:59.920
Oh, yeah. Sure.

34:59.920 --> 35:01.080
Dad, for you.

35:01.080 --> 35:05.080
            Who is it?

35:08.200 --> 35:09.880
                      Yes?

35:09.880 --> 35:13.880
                    Yes, it is.

35:14.520 --> 35:17.000
Yes, I'll...I'll be right down.
You get your coat.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.120
What's wrong, Dad?

35:18.120 --> 35:22.120
Your mom's been in an accident,
honey. I'll get your brother.

35:33.120 --> 35:36.120
    I hope you're asking forgiveness.

35:36.120 --> 35:40.120
Actually, I was deciding whether
to stop by Flannery's for a pop.

35:41.400 --> 35:43.480
Forgiveness for what?

35:43.480 --> 35:46.360
I just finished speaking
with Father Bernard.

35:46.360 --> 35:50.360
He told me at breakfast this morning
you engaged him in a theological
discussion about birth control.

35:51.200 --> 35:55.200
Father Bernard would be a plumber
today if the priesthood required
a vow of silence.

35:56.240 --> 35:59.840
God has set us upon
this earth to multiply.

35:59.840 --> 36:03.240
Interference is a transgression
against his will.

36:03.240 --> 36:06.720
Contraception is a way of preventing
dangerous and unwanted pregnancies.

36:06.720 --> 36:09.760
At a time when babies don't have
enough food in their bellies

36:09.760 --> 36:13.760
or warm clothes on their shivering
bodies, we can't continue to
multiply in blissful ignorance.

36:14.320 --> 36:17.800
St Eligius is a Catholic hospital.

36:17.800 --> 36:20.160
And you, as its chief administrator,

36:20.160 --> 36:22.480
are accountable to God,
to the archdiocese.

36:22.480 --> 36:24.600
I'm aware of that, Monsignor.

36:24.600 --> 36:28.600
I have chosen my faith
and guide my ways accordingly,

36:28.640 --> 36:31.800
but I will not require that every
suffering human who arrives here

36:31.800 --> 36:35.800
be converted before being given
 shelter. That's not compassion.

36:38.680 --> 36:41.560
You laboured to build this hospital.

36:41.560 --> 36:45.560
Running it will be even more
difficult without church funds.

36:47.040 --> 36:51.040
Are you threatening me?

36:52.680 --> 36:55.200
     I don't like you, McCabe.

36:55.200 --> 36:57.080
  You're a smoothie from Southie.

36:57.080 --> 37:00.560
You wear a clerical collar so people
will think you're a good person,

37:00.560 --> 37:02.240
without doing anything to earn it.

37:02.240 --> 37:03.800
And you're a petty bureaucrat

37:03.800 --> 37:05.840
who uses the power of
      the Catholic Church

37:05.840 --> 37:09.840
as if Jesus Christ was your idea!

37:23.720 --> 37:25.960
           Out of shape!

37:25.960 --> 37:27.720
Oh, Phil.

37:27.720 --> 37:31.000
Thanks so much for suggesting
the CAT scan on Mr O'Casey.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.960
He had an allergic
reaction to the dye.

37:33.960 --> 37:35.560
          Medicine's a judgment call.

37:35.560 --> 37:39.560
     You screwed up - you trusted me.

37:39.680 --> 37:43.600
I need the test results
on Terence O'Casey's CAT scan.

37:43.600 --> 37:47.600
I just called my wife, said
I was on my way home for lunch.
Tortellini. Mwah!

37:48.360 --> 37:51.440
The print-out, please. O'Casey.

37:51.440 --> 37:52.000
O'Casey.

37:52.000 --> 37:55.440
O'Casey.
Yeah.

37:55.440 --> 37:56.840
O'Casey...

37:56.840 --> 38:00.400
Not here. Come back after lunch.

38:00.400 --> 38:01.120
You look again.

38:01.120 --> 38:02.440
You look again.
It's not here.

38:02.440 --> 38:03.760
Neither was the tech when
I came down here earlier.

38:03.760 --> 38:06.560
Neither was the tech when
I came down here earlier.
If you're through, so am I.

38:06.560 --> 38:09.640
Wait a second...

38:09.640 --> 38:13.640
Look, I've got a patient upstairs,
I gotta pick up my son...

38:14.800 --> 38:16.400
            Whoa, whoa. Take it easy.

38:16.400 --> 38:17.520
BANGING ON DOOR

38:17.520 --> 38:18.800
Come on, open up! &gt;

38:18.800 --> 38:22.480
I wake up in the morning
and I dread coming to work.
   I get here, I wanna leave.

38:22.480 --> 38:23.040
                        Hey!

38:23.040 --> 38:26.120
                        Hey!
And I know what we do
is important, it's necessary.

38:26.120 --> 38:28.720
Patients depend on us.
They put their trust in us.

38:28.720 --> 38:31.440
And how do we respond?

38:31.440 --> 38:34.680
By losing their paperwork, leaving
them stranded in the hallway,

38:34.680 --> 38:36.840
treating them like
a bunch of symptoms.

38:36.840 --> 38:40.840
And we've abdicated our authority
to technology, to machines.

38:41.800 --> 38:44.960
Now, I may not be the best doctor
in this hospital,

38:44.960 --> 38:48.160
but I care about the people I treat
and I won't let one die

38:48.160 --> 38:52.160
just because my...
    my lunch is getting cold.

38:54.160 --> 38:58.160
And my leg itches.

39:12.760 --> 39:13.800
Any change?

39:13.800 --> 39:15.480
No.

39:15.480 --> 39:19.320
John up in Neurology did a
whole battery of tests on her.

39:19.320 --> 39:23.320
Brain stem is damaged,
              Daniel, very badly.

39:24.160 --> 39:25.960
          What are you gonna do?

39:25.960 --> 39:27.240
What am I gonna do?!

39:27.240 --> 39:30.640
I wait and I pray, same thing I did
with my father after his stroke.

39:30.640 --> 39:33.600
10 years I sat by his
bedside waiting for a miracle.

39:33.600 --> 39:34.640
And you're prepared to
do that all over again?

39:34.640 --> 39:36.960
And you're prepared to
do that all over again?
If I have to.

39:36.960 --> 39:39.640
Donald, even if some day
Marin's heart and lungs

39:39.640 --> 39:43.640
could return to normal function,
her brain is dead.

39:44.720 --> 39:48.720
Daniel, I can't reconcile the
medical facts with what I'm feeling
in my heart. That's my wife.

39:50.200 --> 39:52.800
That's the most vital
human being I've ever known.

39:52.800 --> 39:55.520
She taught me to open up.

39:55.520 --> 39:58.400
I can't imagine life without her,
without that force.

39:58.400 --> 40:02.120
Marin's suffering's over.
Yours is just beginning.

40:02.120 --> 40:06.120
You've got to decide what's best for
your family and, more importantly,
what's best for her.

40:07.080 --> 40:10.200
I'm scared, Daniel. I really am.

40:10.200 --> 40:14.200
What about those kids? How the
hell am I gonna handle Tommy?

40:15.000 --> 40:17.680
She'd laugh at my indecision.

40:17.680 --> 40:21.680
I don't say you've got
to decide this right now.

40:22.480 --> 40:26.480
But if it's her time,
you've got to let her go.

40:27.680 --> 40:30.560
Oh...

40:30.560 --> 40:32.920
  With the bypass graft in place,

40:32.920 --> 40:36.400
I have successfully restored
ample coronary circulation.

40:36.400 --> 40:39.320
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr Patrick O'Casey lives,

40:39.320 --> 40:43.320
thanks in no small way to
the wonders of science and me.

40:46.120 --> 40:47.960
         Burns, you close.

40:47.960 --> 40:51.360
Allen, watch, because
you really need the time.

40:51.360 --> 40:53.240
          And Weinberger,

40:53.240 --> 40:55.200
        you were adequate.

40:55.200 --> 40:59.200
            As always.

41:03.760 --> 41:07.760
         You're the best.

41:08.160 --> 41:09.920
  Ah, the lovely O'Casey family.

41:09.920 --> 41:10.840
How's my father?

41:10.840 --> 41:11.960
How's my father?
         I saved his life.

41:11.960 --> 41:15.720
He should be peddling those pastries
well after the retirement age.

41:15.720 --> 41:16.760
We don't know how to thank you.

41:16.760 --> 41:19.080
We don't know how to thank you.
  Just pay the bill.

41:19.080 --> 41:20.520
  And get this brat out of here.

41:20.520 --> 41:24.360
This is a surgical area for
crying out loud, not a playpen.

41:24.360 --> 41:25.400
Thank you, Doctor.

41:25.400 --> 41:29.280
Your grandpa's all better!

41:29.280 --> 41:31.000
Boy, you're getting heavy!

41:31.000 --> 41:32.520
Already out of breath.

41:32.520 --> 41:36.520
Come on, sweetie.
Isn't it great?

41:39.600 --> 41:40.800
Do something, please!

41:40.800 --> 41:41.840
What happened?

41:41.840 --> 41:45.440
He was drinking. He choked
and stopped breathing.
    What's wrong with him?

41:45.440 --> 41:46.640
I don't know yet.

41:46.640 --> 41:48.320
You're a doctor,
                 you should know.

41:48.320 --> 41:48.760
Ellen, not now.

41:48.760 --> 41:51.280
Ellen, not now.
He's gonna die, isn't he?
My husband's gonna die.

41:51.280 --> 41:53.160
He's not. Not while I'm around.

41:53.160 --> 41:57.160
Let's intubate and get
him on a respirator.

41:58.360 --> 42:02.160
What was this neighbourhood like
when you were growing up?

42:02.160 --> 42:05.200
Mrs Meredith, you'll have to
excuse me. I have to go on rounds.

42:05.200 --> 42:07.320
Can we talk again later?

42:07.320 --> 42:10.520
I don't think I have
           much more to tell you.

42:10.520 --> 42:14.520
I'll call you.

42:30.880 --> 42:33.200
Daddy, I wanna stay in
here with you and Mommy.

42:33.200 --> 42:37.200
Sweetheart, I want you to be Daddy's
very strong little girl, right?

42:38.040 --> 42:40.520
You're gonna have to
help me take care of Tommy.

42:40.520 --> 42:40.960
But I'm so scared!

42:40.960 --> 42:43.120
But I'm so scared!
    I know, sweetie. I know it.

42:43.120 --> 42:47.120
Why don't you go back to the waiting
room and ask Aunt Constance to take
you to get an ice cream cone, right?

42:48.320 --> 42:49.000
Want one?

42:49.000 --> 42:50.600
Want one?
     No, thanks.

42:50.600 --> 42:54.600
    Give your mom a kiss, huh?

42:54.920 --> 42:58.920
Night, Mommy.

43:23.040 --> 43:27.040
I love you, lady.

43:27.600 --> 43:31.600
   Always have and always will.

43:58.760 --> 44:02.760
         Breaks my heart.

44:06.360 --> 44:08.200
Just keep an eye on Terry tonight.

44:08.200 --> 44:11.680
Yes, I will. I'll have you paged if
there's any change in his status.

44:11.680 --> 44:15.680
      Thanks.

44:20.120 --> 44:23.440
               Hey!

44:23.440 --> 44:26.280
Hey, what are you doing with my son?!

44:26.280 --> 44:28.440
       Where are you going?

44:28.440 --> 44:31.240
               Wait!

44:31.240 --> 44:35.240
Where the hell
are you going with my son?!

44:56.400 --> 45:00.400
               Pete?

45:04.920 --> 45:08.640
              Pete?!

45:08.640 --> 45:12.640
              Pete?!

45:15.600 --> 45:45.000
