the battery in backwards.

10:36.026 --> 10:39.290

Malcolm.

water out of the hull.

10:47.516 --> 10:48.996
How'd that happen?

10:49.083 --> 10:52.173
It's nothing.
Just some punk kid swamped me.

them get away with that?

10:54.305 --> 10:55.742
It's no big deal.

I'll just go to another
part of the lake.

you there, too?

about standing up for myself?

I can't beat up a ten-year-old.

11:04.881 --> 11:07.275
I suppose I could hold him down
while you hit him.

11:07.362 --> 11:09.320
No, Dad. Let's beat him
on the water.

11:09.407 --> 11:10.626
With just a few
modifications,

11:10.713 --> 11:12.106
we can make this boat
unstoppable.

11:12.193 --> 11:14.021
We can modify the propeller
for more thrust

11:14.108 --> 11:15.849
and put a titanium tip
on the prow.

11:15.936 --> 11:17.415
We'll slice his boat in half!

11:17.502 --> 11:19.330
-We can really do all that?
-Absolutely.

11:19.417 --> 11:21.724
Could we put a little
skipper on the deck?

11:21.811 --> 11:23.030
I don't see why not.

11:23.117 --> 11:24.509
Oh, Malcolm, it's times
like these

let me get a word in.

inconsiderate of your needs,

In the future, I promise
to be more attentive

And in return,
you will promise

14:24.994 --> 14:27.954
to stop this stupid campaign
to drive me crazy.

didn't you?

15:17.003 --> 15:18.395
Not exactly.

15:18.482 --> 15:20.876

over the weekend, right?
