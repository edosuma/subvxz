00:03.775 --> 00:07.450
<i>It's another
sunny day in Indiana, folks!</i>

00:07.512 --> 00:11.255
<i>It's 90 degrees and climbing.</i>

00:11.316 --> 00:12.818
<i>So throw your kids in a lake,</i>

00:12.884 --> 00:15.296
<i>because it's going
to be a hot one!</i>

00:15.353 --> 00:17.333
<i>All right, now we're going
to try to beat the heat</i>

00:17.388 --> 00:19.493
<i>with another cool off.</i>

00:49.887 --> 00:51.366
<i>Is science your life?</i>

00:53.258 --> 00:54.669
<i>If you just nodded your head,</i>

00:54.726 --> 00:56.672
<i>then you belong at our camp.</i>

00:56.728 --> 00:58.674
<i>Join us this summer
for some scierrific fun.</i>

01:07.572 --> 01:08.812
Hey, where's your brother?

01:10.908 --> 01:12.820
You're going to look up
from that tiny little screen

01:12.844 --> 01:14.721
and your entire summer
is going to be gone.

01:14.779 --> 01:16.417
Why don't you just
throw me in a lake'?

01:16.481 --> 01:17.983
What'?

01:20.618 --> 01:22.291
Go find your brother.

01:29.994 --> 01:31.871
<i>You want to make
your summer worthwhile?</i>

01:31.929 --> 01:32.999
<i>Then sign up now!</i>

01:33.064 --> 01:34.839
<i>Yay!</i>

01:37.068 --> 01:39.844
Come on, we got to go.

01:39.871 --> 01:41.714
Let go of me.
I can walk on my own.

01:44.075 --> 01:46.635
I caught him watching that commercial
for the crazy science camp.

01:46.678 --> 01:48.453
It's not a commercial.
It's an advertisement.

01:48.513 --> 01:50.691
What's the difference? Did you
at least find a bathroom?

01:50.715 --> 01:51.955
No, I got sidetracked.

01:52.016 --> 01:55.486
Albie, do you remember the last
time you tried to hold it too long?

01:55.553 --> 01:56.725
Mom, I'm fine.

02:05.530 --> 02:09.478
Hey, maybe I can go here
instead of science camp.

02:09.500 --> 02:11.537
Oh, honey, I'm sorry

02:11.602 --> 02:13.604
that science camp didn't
work out for this summer.

02:13.671 --> 02:16.050
What am I going to do with that
chemistry set that Dad gave me'?

02:16.074 --> 02:18.918
Yeah, it's really too bad that he
can't go to his dorky science camp.

02:18.976 --> 02:20.922
You know I'm committing
social suicide, right'?

02:20.978 --> 02:22.457
Hashtag life stinks.

02:22.513 --> 02:24.358
Hey, now, you guys
are going to feel differently

02:24.382 --> 02:25.542
when we get to Aunt Jackie's.

02:25.583 --> 02:26.891
Hashtag doubtful.

03:19.570 --> 03:21.811
<i>Oh, shakafaka!</i>

03:21.873 --> 03:23.875
<i>That's one for the record books,
I'll tell you.</i>

03:23.941 --> 03:25.716
<i>And we'll come back
with a lift/e more music</i>

03:25.777 --> 03:28.758
<i>after this quick
commercial break.</i>

03:28.813 --> 03:30.622
<i>Is science your life?</i>

03:30.681 --> 03:32.922
<i>If you just nodded your...</i>

03:32.984 --> 03:34.588
You belong at our camp.

03:34.652 --> 03:36.427
Oh, brother.

04:15.726 --> 04:19.765
Hi! Hey! Hey! Hi!

04:19.831 --> 04:21.902
Hey, I'm so glad to...

04:21.966 --> 04:23.104
Look at this.

04:23.167 --> 04:24.805
It's doing it on its own.

04:26.137 --> 04:28.743
Please tell me we don't have
to be seen in public with her.

04:28.806 --> 04:30.877
Oh, Tiffany, please. Cut it out.

04:30.908 --> 04:31.978
Oh, yeah.

04:32.043 --> 04:33.818
Watch this. Watch me go.

04:33.878 --> 04:36.256
Yeah! Yeah! Come on.

04:38.649 --> 04:39.889
Watch this. Oh, yeah!

04:39.951 --> 04:42.625
I can do the robot. Oh, yeah!

04:42.687 --> 04:44.530
<i>Oh, yeah! Watch!</i>

04:44.589 --> 04:46.569
Come here, come here, come here.

04:46.624 --> 04:48.160
Get over here.
Give me some sugar!

04:48.226 --> 04:50.763
Hey. No, seriously, kid.
You got any candy?

04:50.828 --> 04:52.171
You smell like Werthefis.

04:52.230 --> 04:53.800
So you're saying I'm old'?
Maybe.

04:53.865 --> 04:56.778
You know, I
used to look like her.

04:56.834 --> 04:58.836
Anyway, you are going to be
my new test subject

04:58.903 --> 05:02.180
for my comedy routine because
I can tell you are hilarious.

05:02.240 --> 05:04.720
Lookin' what-what'?

05:04.775 --> 05:05.845
Harassing him already?

05:05.910 --> 05:07.253
Of course!

05:07.512 --> 05:09.219
Hi. Good. Good ride.

05:09.280 --> 05:11.400
Thank you so much for letting
them come stay with you.

05:11.549 --> 05:13.790
Are you kidding? I'm so
excited to have them.

05:13.851 --> 05:15.262
Oh, my gosh. Are you excited?

05:15.520 --> 05:16.225
These look heavy.

05:16.287 --> 05:18.528
They're very heavy.
Okay, be careful then.

05:18.589 --> 05:19.795
Thanks.

05:19.824 --> 05:20.825
Okay, well...

05:20.892 --> 05:23.964
So Luke and I,
we got this last-minute call

05:24.028 --> 05:27.271
to go do some
seismology research in the...

05:27.532 --> 05:29.671
Blah, blah, blah. You
lost me at seismology.

05:29.700 --> 05:31.077
My niece and nephew are here.

05:31.135 --> 05:32.546
It's really exciting.

05:32.603 --> 05:35.675
They're here! They're... kids!

05:35.706 --> 05:38.186
Kids...

05:38.242 --> 05:40.085
Well, you know, they
shouldn't be much trouble.

05:40.144 --> 05:42.249
I mean, Tiffany is 16.

05:42.313 --> 05:44.691
Well, she can't be any worse
than you were at that age.

05:44.749 --> 05:48.219
What'? No. I was a great child.
Shh, shh, shh, no.

05:48.286 --> 05:50.163
Acceptance is good.

05:50.221 --> 05:51.723
<i>You were a brat.</i>

05:51.789 --> 05:53.291
Oh, come on.

05:53.558 --> 05:55.731
Which one is my room'?

05:55.793 --> 05:57.295
Tiffany, your manners.

05:58.596 --> 06:01.702
Just take whichever
room you like.

06:03.568 --> 06:05.309
Oh, she's driving me
absolutely crazy.

06:05.570 --> 06:08.107
Oh, let me tell you about Albie.

06:08.139 --> 06:09.982
Okay. Okay, he's very sensitive.

06:10.007 --> 06:11.987
Okay'? He has
a lot of allergies,

06:12.043 --> 06:14.284
so he should probably just
stay inside most of the time.

06:14.345 --> 06:16.951
Or you'll be dealing
with a lot of problems

06:17.014 --> 06:19.654
<i>like drainage and mucus.
That's a little graphic.</i>

06:19.717 --> 06:21.856
<i>Yeah. Where does
it all come from'?</i>

06:21.919 --> 06:23.921
He also has some trouble
making friends.

06:23.988 --> 06:25.160
So he likes to be alone.

06:25.222 --> 06:28.863
<i>Yeah, he can be
a little awkward.</i>

06:31.696 --> 06:33.073
He stays to himself a lot,

06:33.130 --> 06:34.200
and that's fine.

06:34.265 --> 06:37.678
Don't worry if he doesn't
really engage with you.

06:37.735 --> 06:39.737
He's Brilliant. How do you do?

06:39.770 --> 06:41.306
<i>He loves science</i>

06:41.372 --> 06:44.285
<i>and really learning
anything in a book.</i>

06:44.342 --> 06:46.151
<i>He's great.</i>

06:46.177 --> 06:49.920
Okay, I think fresh air
will do him some good.

06:49.981 --> 06:51.983
No, he should really
probably just stay inside.

06:52.049 --> 06:53.255
No, he should go outside.

06:53.317 --> 06:55.194
Yeah, you should go outside.

06:55.252 --> 06:56.925
Yep, that's it.
I'm kicking you out.

06:56.988 --> 06:58.729
Go, go. But...

06:58.789 --> 07:00.894
Tiffany? Albie'?

07:00.958 --> 07:01.958
I'm leaving.

07:02.827 --> 07:04.306
Goodbye.

07:04.362 --> 07:05.932
Bye. Bye.

07:05.997 --> 07:07.340
Be good.

07:07.398 --> 07:08.775
I'll see you
in a few weeks, okay'?

07:08.833 --> 07:10.835
Have fun.

07:12.870 --> 07:14.872
The bond between
a mother and her son,

07:14.939 --> 07:16.384
it's just, I don't know.

07:16.641 --> 07:19.349
Okay, you be good, too.

07:19.410 --> 07:22.186
Okay.

07:22.246 --> 07:23.919
Can't guarantee anything.

07:23.948 --> 07:25.825
Bye. Bye.

07:27.118 --> 07:29.257
<i>Yeah, they're safe with me.</i>

07:30.955 --> 07:32.730
Have fun in the Grenadines.

07:39.096 --> 07:41.098
Whoa, it's warm up here.

07:41.766 --> 07:44.713
<i>You've been carrying all those
books around in that bag?</i>

07:44.769 --> 07:47.272
Honey, you're going
to get a hunchback.

07:47.338 --> 07:51.753
Master, tonight is time
we bring the creation to life.

07:51.809 --> 07:53.687
Wow, looks like you've got
the tools to do it, too.

07:53.711 --> 07:55.850
This is pretty cool.

07:55.913 --> 07:59.087
There's that smile
I've been looking for.

07:59.116 --> 08:01.118
Hey, I got something
you might like.

08:03.254 --> 08:06.895
A book by Dr. Whittmore.
Did you know him'?

08:06.957 --> 08:10.097
Well, yeah, I know everyone in this town.

08:10.161 --> 08:12.767
I think a
fairy just got its wings.

08:12.830 --> 08:14.741
It's just Tiffany texting.

08:14.799 --> 08:16.107
Mmm.

08:16.167 --> 08:19.376
Apparently my friend Abella's
stepmom's uncle's new wife

08:19.403 --> 08:20.403
has a boat on the lake.

08:20.438 --> 08:22.008
And she asked me to come with.

08:22.073 --> 08:23.916
You have a friend named Abella'?

08:23.974 --> 08:25.180
Oh, I love that name.

08:25.242 --> 08:27.381
Yeah.

08:27.445 --> 08:28.788
Oh, Abella is here.

08:28.846 --> 08:31.258
Later. Oh, peace out.

08:31.315 --> 08:34.818
So what are you going to do
your first day of vacation'?

08:34.885 --> 08:36.990
This book looks informative.

08:37.020 --> 08:39.023
Did you know that
that copy is signed

08:39.090 --> 08:40.933
by Dr. Whittmore himself?

08:40.991 --> 08:43.870
He gave it to our family
along, longtime ago.

08:43.928 --> 08:46.772
But can't let you
read it just yet.

08:47.865 --> 08:48.434
Why not'?

08:48.499 --> 08:50.035
We have to rehearse.

08:50.101 --> 08:51.136
Huh?

08:51.168 --> 08:53.148
Yeah.

08:53.204 --> 08:54.740
We have an audition
in 20 minutes.

09:00.745 --> 09:04.488
<i>♪ I once was lost ♪</i>

09:04.749 --> 09:07.229
♪ But now I'm found ♪

09:07.284 --> 09:13.030
♪ Was blind but now I see ♪

09:23.868 --> 09:27.008

09:29.273 --> 09:31.116
Exes...

09:31.175 --> 09:32.779
Satis...

09:32.810 --> 09:34.949
Amazing.

09:35.012 --> 09:35.888
Did you write that'?

09:35.946 --> 09:38.392
No. Oh.

09:38.449 --> 09:42.329
"Many mumbling mice"

09:42.386 --> 09:46.163
"are making merry music
in the moonlight."

09:46.223 --> 09:47.463
You're on in 10, Mr. Savage.

09:47.525 --> 09:48.833
Thank you, Ted.

09:48.893 --> 09:50.201
It's Cheryl.

09:50.261 --> 09:52.070
Really? Mm-hmm.

09:52.096 --> 09:54.804
Oh.

09:54.865 --> 09:57.937
Next up, Eday Savage.

09:57.968 --> 09:59.003
Oh, French.

09:59.069 --> 10:00.480
Eddie Savage.

10:00.538 --> 10:01.539
Eddie Savage?

10:01.806 --> 10:02.876
That's not French at all.

10:05.843 --> 10:08.414
Hi.

10:08.479 --> 10:11.016
Ladies and gentlemen of Culver,

10:11.081 --> 10:13.527
I will now magically
right before your eyes

10:13.584 --> 10:16.997
bake a cake.

10:25.396 --> 10:27.239
Well, that's disgusting.

10:38.976 --> 10:41.388
Oh, that's... that had
better be gluten-free.

10:59.129 --> 11:00.870
Now...

11:02.867 --> 11:04.869
Ladies and gentlemen... No.

11:04.935 --> 11:06.175
Luive you...

11:06.237 --> 11:07.409
No, no, don't.

11:07.471 --> 11:09.144
Cake!

11:11.876 --> 11:13.549
Why would you even?

11:17.181 --> 11:18.285
Ta-da!

11:21.285 --> 11:23.026
Next!

11:23.053 --> 11:24.333
You might want to clean that up.

11:24.388 --> 11:26.148
Okay, so first thing
we got to do is sign in,

11:26.190 --> 11:28.192
and then were going
to scope out the competition.

11:28.259 --> 11:30.170
Hello there,

11:30.227 --> 11:31.968
ventriloquist boy.

11:32.029 --> 11:34.236
Oh, yes. What is he, like six'?

11:34.298 --> 11:36.039
Dude, we got this.

11:37.534 --> 11:39.309
<i>Wow, look at her.</i>

11:39.370 --> 11:43.045
In her little baton
twirling, sequined dress.

11:44.575 --> 11:46.179
That's our competition.

11:54.051 --> 11:56.361
What the frick
is going on, Garrison?

11:56.420 --> 11:58.058
<i>It's a summer competition.</i>

11:58.088 --> 12:00.295
It's the auditions.
Oh, one time,

12:00.357 --> 12:01.995
I was at a Denny's
with my family.

12:02.059 --> 12:03.970
We just got up in the
middle of the restaurant,

12:04.028 --> 12:05.507
started singing
the national anthem.

12:05.562 --> 12:07.564
It was Presidents' Day.
I was feeling patriotic.

12:07.631 --> 12:10.134
And when I was done,
standing ovation.

12:10.200 --> 12:11.338
Nice. Yeah.

12:13.671 --> 12:16.345
You know, I'm thinking about
going into the talent show.

12:16.407 --> 12:18.318
Check this out. What
would your talent be'?

12:19.710 --> 12:21.451
Hey.

12:21.512 --> 12:23.549
Hey, your ball'?
Your ball went in there'?

12:23.614 --> 12:26.220
Oh, let's see. Oh, right there.

12:26.283 --> 12:27.626
Boo!

12:33.624 --> 12:35.399
Right'? Right'?

12:35.459 --> 12:37.496
<i>Oh, I get it. Whoo!</i>

12:37.528 --> 12:38.632
I get it. I get it.

12:38.696 --> 12:42.303
You'd be going as a ghost
who stuffs kids in trash cans.

12:45.336 --> 12:46.644
What'?

12:51.976 --> 12:54.252
Okay. Sorry I ruined it.

12:54.311 --> 12:56.188
What are you talking about'?

12:56.246 --> 12:59.022
That was... That was hilarious.

12:59.083 --> 13:01.120
It was, you know...
We were okay.

13:01.185 --> 13:02.721
Hey, I got to go
to the grocery store.

13:02.987 --> 13:04.591
So you want to hang here

13:04.655 --> 13:06.532
and you know,
meet me by the boat

13:06.590 --> 13:08.126
in say, half an hour?

13:08.592 --> 13:11.163
I don't know.
What don't you know?

13:11.228 --> 13:13.006
You got to get out there.
You got to make friends.

13:13.030 --> 13:14.509
You got to be a man about town.

13:14.565 --> 13:16.676
Hey, if you see Tiffany you
tell her to meet me by the boat

13:16.700 --> 13:18.543
by five o'clock, okay'?
No later.

13:18.602 --> 13:21.014
Five o'clock. Have fun.

13:26.243 --> 13:29.281
Yeah, I know, right'?

13:29.313 --> 13:31.088
Oh, man. Oh!

13:31.148 --> 13:33.355
So you here for the whole summer?
I don't know.

13:33.417 --> 13:35.462
Yeah, my dad won't tell me
why we came back out here.

13:35.486 --> 13:37.193
I remember when
you used to live here.

13:37.254 --> 13:38.255
You were tiny.

13:38.322 --> 13:40.233
That's 'cause I was six.

13:51.802 --> 13:53.372
Huh, look what we have here.

13:53.437 --> 13:55.110
A little... Dweeb.

13:55.172 --> 13:56.742
No one says "dweeb" anymore.

13:56.807 --> 13:58.582
What are you doing here, dweeb'?

13:58.642 --> 14:00.644
Technically, I'm more
of a bookworm.

14:00.711 --> 14:02.281
"Dweeb" is vintage, all right'?

14:02.346 --> 14:03.484
It's totally in.

14:03.547 --> 14:05.254
Your mom is vintage.
Okay, shut up.

14:05.315 --> 14:06.817
No one plays your mom anymore.

14:07.084 --> 14:08.328
Come on, I asked you a question.

14:08.352 --> 14:09.352
What are you doing here?

14:09.386 --> 14:10.626
I was auditioning.

14:10.687 --> 14:12.724
He's auditioning.

14:12.790 --> 14:14.736
I know what he
was auditioning for.

14:14.758 --> 14:17.170
He was auditioning
for a-a-a dweeb!

14:21.799 --> 14:23.472
What...

14:25.836 --> 14:27.372
A science book?

14:27.438 --> 14:29.645
This kid's got a science book
in the middle of summer.

14:29.706 --> 14:32.346
I mean, how much of a loser
do you got to be'?

14:32.409 --> 14:34.389
You know, this kid from the...

14:34.445 --> 14:35.856
You know what I'm saying?

14:36.113 --> 14:38.115
Right'? Right'? Whoa!

14:39.650 --> 14:40.720
Oh, you didn't.

14:40.784 --> 14:44.231
If you do not leave him be,
I will cast a spell on you

14:44.288 --> 14:45.494
<i>that will tum you purple</i>

14:45.556 --> 14:47.092
<i>and then green</i>

14:47.157 --> 14:49.103
and I will put hair on your back

14:49.159 --> 14:51.161
<i>and boils on your face.</i>

14:51.228 --> 14:54.437
An evil mutant plague shall be cast
upon you and your entire family.

14:54.498 --> 14:56.102
I'm not touching him.

14:59.303 --> 15:01.806
Is this how you saw this going?

15:01.872 --> 15:04.614
No. Can I admit something?

15:04.675 --> 15:06.245
If you must.

15:06.310 --> 15:08.415
I don't really know magic.

15:08.479 --> 15:09.787
Good to know.

15:11.882 --> 15:13.452
<i>Whoa!</i>

15:22.893 --> 15:24.770
What's up, Aaron?

15:24.828 --> 15:26.637
The lake is pretty clean.

15:31.835 --> 15:33.473
I love summer.

15:33.537 --> 15:34.607
I hate it.

15:34.671 --> 15:36.548
I just want to leave.

15:36.607 --> 15:38.553
Hey, there are two things
you should know.

15:38.575 --> 15:40.782
Number one, never let
anyone see you cry in public.

15:40.844 --> 15:42.414
And the second thing'?

15:42.479 --> 15:45.289
Well, look at the bright side.

15:45.349 --> 15:47.295
Now we get to have our revenge.

15:47.351 --> 15:48.561
And how are we
going to do that'?

15:48.585 --> 15:50.462
Well, my cousins, the Savages.

15:50.521 --> 15:51.864
Who?

15:51.922 --> 15:53.833
They live
on the outskirts of town

15:53.857 --> 15:55.495
beyond the junkyard.

15:55.559 --> 15:58.438
Some say they
were born of Vikings,

15:58.495 --> 16:01.169
raised by wolves
and trained samurai...

16:01.231 --> 16:02.369
Can I stop you right there'?

16:02.432 --> 16:04.878
Samurai haven't
been around since 1871.

16:04.935 --> 16:06.846
Oh, did I say samurai?

16:06.870 --> 16:09.248
I meant covert ninjas.

16:09.306 --> 16:10.546
Ch-ch-ch-ch-chow!

16:10.607 --> 16:13.554
I'll pass. I just want
to be left alone.

16:16.446 --> 16:20.292
We shall be avenged!

16:21.818 --> 16:23.525
He's not on Facebook.

16:23.587 --> 16:24.895
Are you for reals'? I know.

16:24.955 --> 16:26.457
I was like, "I can't believe"

16:26.523 --> 16:27.866
"you don't have the Internet."

16:27.925 --> 16:29.199
And he says,

16:29.259 --> 16:30.533
"I have the Internet."

16:30.594 --> 16:31.834
"I just don't have Facebook."

16:31.895 --> 16:34.398
I'm confused.
It doesn't make sense.

16:34.464 --> 16:36.809
How am I ever supposed to figure
out his relationship status'?

16:36.833 --> 16:39.871
That's what I'm saying.
Excuse me.

16:39.937 --> 16:41.211
Oh, my aunt is here.

16:41.238 --> 16:42.376
Great. Later.

16:42.439 --> 16:43.543
Bye. Bye.

16:46.843 --> 16:48.754
Do you two not own a watch'?

16:48.779 --> 16:50.918
Huh'? Seriously,
you're like 20 minutes late.

16:50.981 --> 16:54.758
Uh, no. Only old
people wear watches.

16:54.785 --> 16:56.230
Oops.

16:56.253 --> 16:57.755
Oh. Oh, Well...

16:57.821 --> 16:59.300
lucky for me

16:59.356 --> 17:01.632
I don't own a watch.

17:01.692 --> 17:03.000
Oops.

17:03.260 --> 17:04.500
Aunt Jackie, Abella just wrote.

17:04.560 --> 17:05.681
Can I have dinner with her'?

17:05.729 --> 17:07.299
Yeah, yeah.

17:07.364 --> 17:09.901
Please, go have dinner with her.

17:09.967 --> 17:11.640
Thanks, bye. Bye.

17:13.637 --> 17:16.810
I'll miss you.

17:16.873 --> 17:19.819
So it looks like it's just
me and you for dinner.

17:19.876 --> 17:20.980
What you say, Albie'?

17:21.244 --> 17:23.452
Sure. Sure, okay.

17:23.512 --> 17:26.824
Hey, I see finally decided
to go for a swim.

17:26.883 --> 17:28.988
Proud of you.

17:29.253 --> 17:30.323
It wasn't by choice.

17:30.387 --> 17:32.958
Oh, well then I take it back.

17:33.023 --> 17:34.400
Clutz.

17:45.502 --> 17:47.482
<i>Well-known philanthropist.</i>

17:47.537 --> 17:50.279
<i>We all knew Mr. Whittmore
was a bit of an eccentric.</i>

17:50.340 --> 17:51.717
<i>He once said in an interview</i>

17:51.775 --> 17:53.948
<i>that he never really fit in.</i>

17:54.011 --> 17:56.287
<i>Interesting news
in regards to his will</i>

17:56.346 --> 17:59.293
<i>is surfacing now,
a year after his passing.</i>

17:59.316 --> 18:00.386
<i>Thank you, Daisy.</i>

18:00.450 --> 18:02.487
<i>We'll have more
as that story develops.</i>

18:02.552 --> 18:04.293
Why do you think it took so long

18:04.354 --> 18:06.425
to release Mr. Whittmore's
final statement?

18:06.490 --> 18:08.697
I don't know the logistics
behind it all,

18:08.759 --> 18:11.797
but the news that Mr. Whittmore
has hidden a treasure chest

18:11.862 --> 18:13.842
containing a sizable amount
of his estate

18:13.897 --> 18:15.433
has officially been released.

18:15.499 --> 18:16.910
Do you think it was a final ploy

18:16.967 --> 18:19.538
to increase tourism in this
town he loved and called home?

18:19.603 --> 18:22.482
Culver doesn't need any more
tourists during the summer.

18:22.539 --> 18:23.483
We do fine already.

18:23.540 --> 18:26.885
But it is buried here in Culver.
Yes.

18:26.943 --> 18:28.479
And Mr. Whittmore hid clues

18:28.545 --> 18:30.456
to help one
lucky individual find it'?

18:30.514 --> 18:32.016
That's right.

18:32.082 --> 18:34.653
Well, I think we can expect
our little town

18:34.718 --> 18:36.925
to get a bit busier
over the next few days.

18:36.987 --> 18:38.330
I'm Daisy Larson,

18:38.355 --> 18:39.698
Channel 11 News.

18:40.824 --> 18:43.600
Now, Mr. Whittmore was known
for being an inventor,

18:43.660 --> 18:46.368
but he was actually a very
accomplished businessman.

18:46.430 --> 18:48.671
In fact, he gave loans
to other businessmen

18:48.732 --> 18:50.678
hoping to better the community.

18:50.734 --> 18:53.476
Have you ever been
to Whittmore's root beer stand'?

18:53.537 --> 18:55.039
No. No'?

18:55.105 --> 18:56.880
Well, Mr. Whittmore

18:56.907 --> 18:58.750
gave a man named Fritz Bronson

18:58.809 --> 19:01.756
a sizable loan
to start the root beer stand.

19:01.812 --> 19:03.018
With your contributions

19:03.080 --> 19:04.787
I'd like to open
a root beer stand

19:04.848 --> 19:08.887
where patrons can enjoy a nice
cold beverage during the summer.

19:08.919 --> 19:12.662
That sounds like the best
idea I've ever heard.

19:12.723 --> 19:15.067
<i>He just loved the idea
of seeing the community flourish.</i>

19:15.125 --> 19:17.537
He wanted that to be his legacy.

19:31.041 --> 19:34.614
All right.

19:34.678 --> 19:36.658
The root beer stand
was very popular.

19:36.713 --> 19:39.091
But Fritz was always looking
for a way to make more money.

19:39.149 --> 19:42.596
So he wanted to sell the root
beer stand to turn a profit.

19:42.652 --> 19:45.531
But Dr. Whittmore didn't want
something that the community enjoyed

19:45.555 --> 19:47.466
to go away,

19:47.524 --> 19:49.595
so he bought it from Fritz.

19:49.659 --> 19:51.536
I've never had root beer.

19:51.561 --> 19:53.666
You've never had root beer.

19:53.697 --> 19:55.768
Okay, I don't even know
what to say to that.

19:55.832 --> 19:56.936
I'm going to take you.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.570
I think I'm allergic.

19:58.635 --> 20:01.912
Maybe you will meet some new
friends and they can take you.

20:02.906 --> 20:04.886
I don't think people
like me here.

20:04.941 --> 20:06.943
Why would you say that'?

20:06.977 --> 20:10.618
This boy kind of threw me
in the lake.

20:19.423 --> 20:20.902
That's the guy.

20:22.659 --> 20:24.969
<i>Oh, Billy Bronson.</i>

20:36.173 --> 20:39.017
It's pretty late. Sorry,
I lost track of time.

20:39.075 --> 20:41.475
I don't think you should be
hanging out with kids like Billy.

20:41.511 --> 20:44.082
Okay. Tiffany, if you don't learn
to function without that thing,

20:44.147 --> 20:45.785
your brain is going
to turn into mush.

20:45.849 --> 20:47.795
Tiffany. Yeah.

20:47.851 --> 20:49.429
Why would you want
to hang outwith people

20:49.453 --> 20:51.956
who think it's cool to throw
kids in the lake'? Jackie!

20:52.022 --> 20:53.899
You whiny little tattletale.

20:53.957 --> 20:55.201
<i>Billy just said
they were having fun.</i>

20:55.225 --> 20:56.636
That is your brother.

20:56.693 --> 20:58.570
Just leave me alone, okay'?

20:58.628 --> 20:59.971
I don't even want to be here.

21:00.030 --> 21:02.738
You know, just because
Mom and Dad are too busy for us

21:02.799 --> 21:03.943
doesn't mean they
just dump us here.

21:03.967 --> 21:06.072
Okay, that's unfair.
Life is unfair.

21:12.676 --> 21:14.121
They're not too busy.

21:18.114 --> 21:20.185
Maybe we all
just need some sleep.

21:20.250 --> 21:21.888
<i>Come on.</i>

21:43.807 --> 21:44.717
Get dressed.

21:44.774 --> 21:47.050
Grandma needs an oil change.

21:47.110 --> 21:48.589
My pontoon boat,

21:48.645 --> 21:49.919
I named her Grandma

21:49.946 --> 21:51.118
after my grandma.

21:51.181 --> 21:52.592
She needs an oil change.

21:52.649 --> 21:53.787
Get dressed.

22:14.738 --> 22:16.149
Yeah. What was I
telling you, man'?

22:16.206 --> 22:19.551
They just ran off.
It was so great.

22:19.576 --> 22:22.819
And I was like,
that's not his hand.

22:22.879 --> 22:25.086
<i>Walk away. Walk away.</i>

22:25.148 --> 22:27.560
<i>I was like, whoa.</i>

22:27.584 --> 22:28.824
Oh, man.

22:28.885 --> 22:30.592
I need you to tune this up.

22:30.654 --> 22:31.864
Yeah, I need it in tip top shape

22:31.888 --> 22:33.993
for this weekend's
Wave Runner competition.

22:34.057 --> 22:35.737
Yeah, we've got a heavy
workload this week,

22:35.792 --> 22:37.003
but I can take
a look at it for you.

22:37.027 --> 22:38.904
Well, you take
a look at it then.

22:38.962 --> 22:40.635
In the meantime,
we'll be out there

22:40.697 --> 22:42.233
smashing it up
in my new Master craft.

22:42.265 --> 22:44.040
Oh, yeah, the green one,
number 25.

22:44.100 --> 22:45.602
It's the green one behind you.

22:45.669 --> 22:46.670
It's so fast.

22:46.736 --> 22:47.736
Yeah, it's nice.

22:47.771 --> 22:48.909
How fast is it, Harley?

22:48.972 --> 22:52.181
It's like a cheetah
on a treadmill. Just...

22:54.244 --> 22:56.190
Oh, I totally know.

22:56.246 --> 22:57.919
Well, let me incline real quick.

22:57.981 --> 22:59.221
You know?

22:59.282 --> 23:02.263
It's like that, bro.
It's like that, bro.

23:05.088 --> 23:06.863
That makes no sense.

23:06.890 --> 23:09.734
What was that'?

23:09.759 --> 23:11.033
<i>He said something.</i>

23:11.094 --> 23:12.732
Are you challenging me, bro'?

23:12.762 --> 23:14.901
Because I see you
in your competition

23:14.965 --> 23:18.071
coming in third, fourth.

23:18.134 --> 23:20.646
I had a messed up ankle, but I could
take you any day of the week.

23:20.670 --> 23:22.274
<i>Oh-ho! Did you hear that?</i>

23:22.339 --> 23:23.977
Any day of the week.

23:24.040 --> 23:25.781
<i>Okay, we can
go out there right now.</i>

23:25.842 --> 23:27.617
Yeah? Yeah.

23:27.677 --> 23:29.156
Yeah? Go ahead.

23:32.782 --> 23:33.920
I can't. I'm working.

23:33.984 --> 23:35.964
You can't because
you know you'd lose.

23:42.726 --> 23:43.636
That's a crow.

23:43.693 --> 23:45.695
It's a chicken-crow, bro.

23:48.231 --> 23:50.677
Billy, anytime after hours.

23:50.734 --> 23:53.305
Yeah, well, after you
tune up my Wave Runner.

23:55.372 --> 23:59.184
Yeah.

23:59.242 --> 24:01.017
I was going to get the yellow.

24:01.077 --> 24:02.920
You were going to get it yellow?
Yeah, yellow.

24:02.979 --> 24:04.287
I like green, Billy. Yeah.

24:04.347 --> 24:06.054
You always make good decisions.

24:08.685 --> 24:10.096
I'll be here about 30 minutes

24:10.153 --> 24:13.999
so why don't you go outside and play'?

24:14.057 --> 24:15.730
Do you even know
what "go play" means?

24:15.792 --> 24:17.362
It means get out of here.
Go be a kid.

24:17.427 --> 24:18.735
Go.

24:43.687 --> 24:45.360
Here it is.

24:45.422 --> 24:47.368
Oh, okay.

24:47.390 --> 24:49.097
It fell off.

24:50.427 --> 24:52.703
Shazam.

24:52.762 --> 24:53.762
Yes!

24:54.898 --> 24:55.968
Oh.

24:56.032 --> 24:58.740
No, I didn't like it.

24:59.969 --> 25:01.107
Okay.

25:01.137 --> 25:02.377
You know, but I mean,

25:02.439 --> 25:03.918
you put in some effort.

25:03.973 --> 25:06.146
So. Well, there's that.

25:06.209 --> 25:07.984
Extra point. That's something.

25:10.113 --> 25:12.423
Trespasser! Let's get him!

25:12.482 --> 25:14.189
Hey, hey, hey. It's okay.

25:14.250 --> 25:15.991
I know him.

25:16.052 --> 25:17.395
Let him prove himself.

25:19.155 --> 25:21.157
So you do any tricks'?

25:21.224 --> 25:24.034
I don't have a bike
like you guys.

25:24.094 --> 25:25.732
He doesn't have a bike.

25:25.795 --> 25:29.140
Eddie, get him
Old Man Kettle's bike.

25:29.199 --> 25:31.338
Oh.

25:31.401 --> 25:32.880
Not sure if he could handle.

25:32.936 --> 25:35.280
Old Man Kettle's bike.

25:35.338 --> 25:38.785
Wait, is this the kid that cried
when he got tossed in the lake?

25:38.842 --> 25:39.912
That's him.

25:39.976 --> 25:41.284
<i>Oh, where are my manners?</i>

25:41.344 --> 25:43.950
Albie, this is Winnie

25:44.013 --> 25:45.754
and Vinny. Hi.

25:45.815 --> 25:48.022
They're my cousins.

25:48.084 --> 25:50.223
Who was Old Man Kettle'?

25:50.286 --> 25:52.960
He's Culver's only homeless person.
Yeah.

25:53.022 --> 25:55.195
<i>He ditched his bike
on the side of the road</i>

25:55.258 --> 25:56.828
before he disappeared.

25:56.893 --> 25:58.429
Guess who found the bike.

25:58.495 --> 25:59.940
Him?

25:59.996 --> 26:01.066
Mm-mm.

26:01.131 --> 26:03.168
I did.

26:03.233 --> 26:04.233
She did. He did.

26:05.502 --> 26:07.038
We did.

26:07.103 --> 26:08.514
Sometimes I see her thoughts.

26:08.772 --> 26:10.774
Yeah, and sometimes it's creepy.

26:10.807 --> 26:12.809
Old Man Kettle
didn't have any teeth.

26:12.876 --> 26:15.356
Legend has it he lost them

26:15.411 --> 26:16.411
riding his bike.

26:17.480 --> 26:19.482
She's a tough ride.

26:19.549 --> 26:21.256
Why don't you go get it for him'?
Yeah.

26:21.317 --> 26:23.991
Oh, yeah.

26:24.053 --> 26:27.262
I've always wondered why he keeps
wearing that top hat and cape.

26:27.323 --> 26:28.996
He goes through phases.

26:29.058 --> 26:32.198
Yeah, last month, he thought he was
a professional baseball player.

26:32.262 --> 26:33.969
Now he thinks he's a magician.

26:34.030 --> 26:37.102
And next month, he's probably going
to think he's a sumo wrestler.

26:42.972 --> 26:44.918
Well, if you're up for a race,

26:44.974 --> 26:46.851
<i>I'm sure Old Man Kettle
wouldn't mind</i>

26:46.910 --> 26:49.015
you borrowing his bike.

26:49.078 --> 26:51.991
And I was a professional
baseball player.

26:52.048 --> 26:53.925
Um, I don't think
I'm going to ride that.

26:53.983 --> 26:55.519
If you want to hang
with the Savages,

26:55.585 --> 26:56.928
you kind of have to race us.

26:56.986 --> 26:59.296
Are you here to bike
or be a sissy?

26:59.355 --> 27:00.834
No.

27:00.890 --> 27:02.563
Hey, you allergic
to bikes, too'?

27:05.028 --> 27:06.439
<i>There you go.</i>

27:06.496 --> 27:08.498
<i>Come on, race Winnie.</i>

27:08.565 --> 27:10.010
She's a girl.

27:10.066 --> 27:12.512
Hey. That's debatable.

27:12.569 --> 27:14.515
Yeah. All right, I'll do it.

27:14.571 --> 27:16.107
That a boy.

27:16.139 --> 27:17.914
All right, so...

27:17.974 --> 27:20.113
down the hill,
through the dirt track,

27:20.176 --> 27:21.553
and hang a left
at the graveyard.

27:21.611 --> 27:22.988
First person back wins.

27:23.046 --> 27:23.581
I got this.

27:23.847 --> 27:25.884
Did he say graveyard?

27:25.949 --> 27:27.326
Dead people live there.

27:27.383 --> 27:29.920
Woo... Ready...

27:29.986 --> 27:31.988
set... go!

27:34.290 --> 27:35.530
Let's go.

27:36.993 --> 27:38.597
<i>I bet 20 bucks on Winnie.</i>

28:07.156 --> 28:09.158
He's like an expert on that.

28:25.208 --> 28:26.278
Ah!

28:26.342 --> 28:27.446
Oh!

28:27.510 --> 28:28.511
My'

28:33.082 --> 28:35.221
You okay?

28:35.285 --> 28:37.196
Old Man Kettle's bike is a hog.

28:37.253 --> 28:38.493
You were flying.

28:38.554 --> 28:40.329
Did that hurt'?

28:40.356 --> 28:41.699
It was amazing.

28:41.958 --> 28:43.494
Albie is a champ.

28:43.559 --> 28:45.664
I want a rematch.

28:45.929 --> 28:47.135
You could have won.

28:47.196 --> 28:48.231
I know.

28:49.933 --> 28:51.344
Welcome to the Savages.

28:53.636 --> 28:55.206
You okay'? I'm good.

28:57.073 --> 29:01.021
All righty, so we changed
the oil on the pontoon.

29:01.077 --> 29:03.683
Okay. And we did a routine
maintenance check.

29:03.947 --> 29:05.688
And it turns out it had bad gas.

29:05.949 --> 29:08.088
Oh, poor Grandma.

29:08.151 --> 29:09.494
That happens when you get older.

29:09.519 --> 29:12.295
Ba-dam-bam! Hmm?

29:15.325 --> 29:16.998
Hey, how much do I owe you'?

29:17.060 --> 29:19.131
I already fixed you.
You're good to go.

29:19.195 --> 29:21.436
No extra charge? No,
consider it on the house.

29:21.497 --> 29:23.534
Todd, you're the best.
Thank you.

29:23.599 --> 29:25.169
Of course. Hello.

29:25.234 --> 29:27.111
Hey, Todd. Winnie fell
off her bike.

29:27.170 --> 29:30.049
Oh, Oh. I didn't fall. I flew.

29:30.106 --> 29:31.449
All right, thank you.

29:31.507 --> 29:32.718
Here, let me help you with that.

29:32.742 --> 29:34.415
Here, let's see it.

29:36.179 --> 29:37.317
Are you a nurse?

29:37.380 --> 29:39.553
No, no.

29:39.615 --> 29:41.117
I'm more of a comedian.

29:41.184 --> 29:43.528
Oh. OW.

29:43.553 --> 29:45.055
You know what'?

29:45.121 --> 29:47.366
That looks bad. I don't think
this is going to do the trick.

29:47.390 --> 29:48.232
I'll tell you what.

29:48.324 --> 29:50.702
Why don't you all
come back to my house,

29:50.760 --> 29:52.706
and I can clean up your knee

29:52.762 --> 29:55.402
and I can feed you all dinner.

29:55.465 --> 29:57.411
Truth is, I make a mean lasagna.

29:57.433 --> 29:59.071
Score!

29:59.135 --> 30:01.445
I love people who feed me.

30:01.504 --> 30:03.313
Thank you.

30:21.190 --> 30:22.760
Hey. Good morning.

30:23.026 --> 30:25.700
Could you tell Billy
to come in for appetizers?

30:25.762 --> 30:27.571
Where is he'?

30:27.597 --> 30:29.599
Outback.

30:29.665 --> 30:32.441
Aw, geez.

30:43.646 --> 30:46.559
Billy!

30:46.616 --> 30:47.526
What are you doing?

30:47.583 --> 30:50.063
What is that, yoga'?

30:50.086 --> 30:51.588
Dinner! Let's go!

30:51.654 --> 30:53.634
Oh, here I come, Dad.

30:53.689 --> 30:55.430
I'll be right there.

31:00.263 --> 31:02.607
Dinner already?

31:02.632 --> 31:04.509
I've only done
five turnarounds, Dad.

31:04.567 --> 31:07.343
What's the kid doing?
He's out there like this.

31:07.403 --> 31:09.474
He looks like... who rides
a jet ski on their back'?

31:09.539 --> 31:10.813
It's summer.

31:11.074 --> 31:12.348
It's what they do.

31:12.375 --> 31:14.480
Like a repulsive seal.

31:14.544 --> 31:15.818
What are you doing?

31:16.079 --> 31:17.422
It's cheese time, Mr. Fritz.

31:17.480 --> 31:18.550
Oh, it is cheese time'?

31:18.614 --> 31:23.359
It's cheese time. Can
you make a quesadilla'?

31:23.419 --> 31:25.262
Yes. Okay, go do it.

31:25.321 --> 31:27.301
<i>So I met with the mayor today.</i>

31:27.356 --> 31:29.768
Did you'? Mm-hmm, and I'm finally
going to be able to prove

31:29.826 --> 31:33.137
once and for all that that
root beer stand is mine.

31:33.196 --> 31:36.871
Why'? Why can't we
just go back to Chicago?

31:37.133 --> 31:39.636
Billy, use your dome, okay'?

31:39.702 --> 31:42.808
The Whittmore treasure hunt
is about to begin any day now.

31:42.872 --> 31:45.546
And I know that he hid
a clue in that root beer stand.

31:45.608 --> 31:46.882
He did love that thing.

31:47.143 --> 31:49.646
Who likes root beer'? You
drink root beer'? Yeah.

31:49.712 --> 31:51.248
You do. Mm-hmm.

31:51.314 --> 31:52.486
Who else drinks root beer'?

31:52.548 --> 31:53.788
<i>Every-everyone, really.</i>

31:53.850 --> 31:56.524
The community absolutely
loves it there, Fritz.

31:58.554 --> 31:59.658
They love it.

32:01.157 --> 32:02.597
Here's what
we're going to do, okay'?

32:02.625 --> 32:04.385
Okay. You and your friends
are going to start

32:04.427 --> 32:05.747
digging around there, okay'?
Okay.

32:05.795 --> 32:07.468
Once the first clue is released.

32:07.530 --> 32:09.339
We'll just make it look
like you found it.

32:09.398 --> 32:13.210
Wait, so that means you
know where the treasure is'?

32:13.269 --> 32:14.577
Do I know where
the treasure is'?

32:14.637 --> 32:16.275
Yeah, do you know where it is'?

32:16.339 --> 32:18.546
No. Where? It's buried.

32:18.574 --> 32:20.144
Guess where it's buried. Where?

32:20.176 --> 32:22.713
Deep in a seashell in the ocean.

32:22.778 --> 32:24.815
And there's a big man
with a gray beard

32:24.881 --> 32:26.554
<i>named Neptune,
and he's holding it.</i>

32:26.582 --> 32:28.289
<i>Isn't that exciting?</i>

32:28.317 --> 32:29.895
Billy, grow up.
You believe in unicorns'?

32:29.919 --> 32:31.830
I don't know where it is!

32:31.888 --> 32:34.630
What are you, five?

32:34.690 --> 32:36.567
How much sun did you get today'?

32:37.727 --> 32:40.708
Uh, I don't know.

32:40.730 --> 32:43.301
You're wearing
lime green shorts.

32:43.366 --> 32:44.709
When you wear lime shorts,

32:44.767 --> 32:46.474
what do you look like?

32:46.536 --> 32:49.710
What did I tell you'?

32:49.739 --> 32:51.912
Sn-snowcone.

32:52.175 --> 32:53.449
You look like a snow cone.

32:53.509 --> 32:56.615
What are you doing? You want
to be a human snow cone?

32:56.679 --> 32:58.181
Now, why do you
have to do that'?

32:58.247 --> 32:59.487
I don't want to be a snow cone.

32:59.549 --> 33:00.926
Kid looks like a snow cone.

33:01.184 --> 33:03.323
Fritz. He wears lime green.

33:06.589 --> 33:08.330
This is a nice house.

33:08.357 --> 33:09.427
Kind of old.

33:09.492 --> 33:11.369
I think it was built
in the 1800s.

33:14.363 --> 33:16.866
Yikes. What'?

33:16.899 --> 33:20.506
You didn't tell me you had
an older sister. Oh, sorry.

33:20.570 --> 33:23.744
It's just... Look.

33:23.773 --> 33:25.218
Hey, can I help?

33:27.410 --> 33:28.821
Uh, I'm good.

33:30.346 --> 33:31.882
See what I mean'?

33:31.948 --> 33:33.950
Hormones.

33:34.217 --> 33:35.491
<i>Is that a kind of food?</i>

33:35.518 --> 33:36.518
'Cause I'll eat it.

33:36.552 --> 33:38.793
Okay, here we go.

33:38.854 --> 33:42.631
Now, where does spaghetti
go to dance'?

33:42.658 --> 33:44.535
At the meatball.

33:48.364 --> 33:49.934
Oh, I know, I know.

33:49.999 --> 33:51.876
It's just torturelini.

33:53.502 --> 33:54.776
Oh, my ride is here. Bye.

33:54.837 --> 33:56.481
I thought you were going
to have dinner with us.

33:56.505 --> 33:58.815
Uh, mmm, delicious.

33:58.874 --> 33:59.784
Thanks for dinner.

33:59.842 --> 34:01.913
Teenagers.

34:03.646 --> 34:05.421
Okay, who's going
to say the blessing?

34:05.481 --> 34:06.323
I Will!

34:06.382 --> 34:07.690
You're on.

34:08.784 --> 34:09.659
Dear God,

34:09.719 --> 34:11.289
Please bless the lasagna,

34:11.353 --> 34:12.389
<i>my brother Todd,</i>

34:12.455 --> 34:14.400
<i>sister Winnie, cousin Eddie,</i>

34:14.456 --> 34:15.993
<i>and Albie and all his allergies,</i>

34:16.259 --> 34:18.261
<i>the nice older lady
that's feeding us,</i>

34:18.327 --> 34:19.806
and Old Man Kettle.

34:19.862 --> 34:21.899
He's probably dead
in a ditch somewhere.

34:21.964 --> 34:23.739
But if not, please let him know

34:23.799 --> 34:26.609
we have his bike and we're taking
really good care of it for him.

34:26.668 --> 34:28.444
Amen.

34:28.504 --> 34:29.676
Amen.

34:29.739 --> 34:32.879
Okay, thank you, Vinny,

34:32.942 --> 34:35.422
said the nice older lady.

34:35.478 --> 34:36.821
I'm happy-

34:36.846 --> 34:39.292
Yeah, well, I'm glad someone is.

34:39.348 --> 34:41.350
Mayor Coleman, what did he say'?

34:41.417 --> 34:42.896
Please, please.

34:42.952 --> 34:46.559
Straight from the will
of Mr. Whittmore.

34:46.589 --> 34:48.967
It says that I, the mayor,

34:49.025 --> 34:52.632
Richard Coleman,
am to read the first clue

34:52.695 --> 34:55.039
on the first year anniversary

34:55.297 --> 34:56.833
of Mr. Whittmore's passing.

34:56.899 --> 34:59.607
The first clue is as follows.

34:59.669 --> 35:03.378
"The truly great are remembered
by their compassion

35:03.439 --> 35:05.441
"and generosity to others,

35:05.474 --> 35:07.010
"not by their accomplishments

35:07.076 --> 35:08.851
"and awards they receive

35:08.911 --> 35:11.585
"in their image." Thank you.

35:11.614 --> 35:13.457
Mayor Coleman, what do
you think that means?

35:13.516 --> 35:14.722
That will be all for now.

35:14.784 --> 35:15.864
Are there any other clues'?

35:15.918 --> 35:17.625
That will be all
for now. Thank you.

35:48.918 --> 35:51.023
Chug, chug, chug!

35:56.759 --> 35:58.067
Oh! Oh, my gosh.

35:58.127 --> 35:59.629
You enjoy nothing.

36:06.769 --> 36:09.579
What did you do'?

36:09.638 --> 36:11.584
You're such an idiot.

36:11.640 --> 36:14.086
<i>Oh, really? Yeah, that's right.</i>

36:15.578 --> 36:19.651
All right, you got it'?

36:19.682 --> 36:22.390
They released
the first clue last night.

36:22.418 --> 36:24.125
I think we should get to work.

36:24.387 --> 36:26.663
When I was reading
Mr. Whittmore's book last night,

36:26.722 --> 36:28.702
I saw this really weird symbol

36:28.758 --> 36:30.931
that seems like it has to do
with the treasure.

36:30.993 --> 36:34.941
How is that going to help us
with our revenge on Billy'?

36:34.997 --> 36:36.067
Yeah.

36:37.767 --> 36:39.075
I don't get girls.

36:39.101 --> 36:40.444
I really don't know either.

36:40.503 --> 36:41.538
Tell me about it.

36:41.604 --> 36:42.948
When I look at myself
in the mirror,

36:42.972 --> 36:45.077
I'm like, "I don't get you."

36:45.107 --> 36:46.848
Yeah. I'm going to
go talk to her.

36:46.909 --> 36:49.981
Whoa, only a fool
rushes into relationships.

36:50.045 --> 36:52.685
If you want more relationship
advice, just come to me at any time

36:52.748 --> 36:55.394
except for Sunday, Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

36:55.418 --> 36:56.954
I'm free on Saturdays.

36:57.019 --> 36:58.464
How is he related to us'?

36:58.521 --> 36:59.795
No idea. Anytime, my friend.

36:59.855 --> 37:02.836
He's already going
through another phase.

37:05.861 --> 37:08.171
The green one. Yeah.

37:08.431 --> 37:10.001
So fast. Such a cool boat.

37:10.065 --> 37:12.978
<i>Have a great day. Enjoy!</i>

37:13.035 --> 37:15.106
Ha, Tiffany,
it looks like your brother

37:15.171 --> 37:18.618
needs his diaper changed.

37:18.674 --> 37:21.883
Albie, why don't you go
back over with your friends?

37:21.944 --> 37:23.617
Okay?

37:23.679 --> 37:25.158
Hey, congratulations, little guy.
Go.

37:25.214 --> 37:26.852
You became friends
with the untouchables.

37:26.916 --> 37:28.589
Dude, you shouldn't
congratulate someone

37:28.617 --> 37:29.960
for becoming friends with them.

37:30.019 --> 37:31.692
Here's my fries.

37:31.754 --> 37:33.097
<i>Ra-ra-ra-ra-ra.</i>

37:33.155 --> 37:35.465
I will destroy
all of our friends.

37:35.524 --> 37:37.128
<i>Dude, it's sarcasm.</i>

37:37.159 --> 37:38.866
All right'?
It's the latest rage.

37:38.928 --> 37:39.998
Well, what is sarcasm?

37:40.062 --> 37:41.006
Is that like a shop,

37:41.063 --> 37:42.872
because my mom
buys all my clothes.

37:42.932 --> 37:44.502
Go away.

37:44.567 --> 37:46.911
Go.

37:46.969 --> 37:49.040
I mean, what-what
is wrong with that kid'?

37:49.104 --> 37:50.708
She hates me, too.

37:50.773 --> 37:53.879
Vinny, the book. Get the book.

37:53.943 --> 37:55.889
<i>Oh, right. Speaking of revenge,</i>

37:55.911 --> 37:58.619
here's a funny way
to make that feeling

37:58.681 --> 38:01.628
that you feel inside
of you right now disappear,

38:01.650 --> 38:02.958
<i>go away.</i>

38:03.018 --> 38:04.554
<i>Vanish.</i>

38:04.620 --> 38:08.193
Through revenge on the Bronsons.

38:08.257 --> 38:09.531
Here's the plan.

38:11.227 --> 38:13.639
We kill them with the
mustard and ketchup.

38:13.696 --> 38:15.642
How... no, no.

38:15.664 --> 38:18.042
Just spritz it all over them
to make them humiliated.

38:18.100 --> 38:20.910
How can you not see that'?
I've written it out perfectly.

38:20.970 --> 38:23.210
How would you even kill someone
with mustard and ketchup?

38:26.509 --> 38:29.183
I mean, you guys did put
a single eyes.

38:31.780 --> 38:35.091
Hey. Hi.

38:35.150 --> 38:36.652
What are you doing?

38:36.685 --> 38:39.529
I had an idea for a song lyric.

38:39.588 --> 38:40.225
So you're a singer.

38:40.289 --> 38:43.668
No.

38:43.726 --> 38:45.728
Okay.

38:45.794 --> 38:49.037
I-I am a singer.

38:49.098 --> 38:51.544
And funny, too. I..

38:51.600 --> 38:56.106
Cool, you should try out for
the talent show competition.

38:56.171 --> 38:57.878
I thought
the additions were over.

38:57.940 --> 38:59.817
Well, they're going
until the end of the day,

38:59.875 --> 39:01.946
so maybe you should try out.

39:03.312 --> 39:04.689
Maybe I will.

39:05.915 --> 39:07.690
Hey, Billy. Todd.

39:09.051 --> 39:10.553
Todd just went down there, yes.

39:10.619 --> 39:12.098
By Tiffany.

39:12.154 --> 39:14.794
Right down there.

39:14.857 --> 39:17.098
And-and if you want to go to
the festival with anybody...

39:17.159 --> 39:18.638
Yeah, with me'?

39:18.694 --> 39:20.002
That... that would be great.

39:20.062 --> 39:22.804
Oh, no.

39:22.865 --> 39:24.242
You see, Todd, Tiffany is...

39:24.300 --> 39:27.611
Tiffany is like a...
Like a... like a

39:27.670 --> 39:29.980
"it" girl.

39:30.039 --> 39:33.316
And you're just a it...

39:33.576 --> 39:35.578
Boy? Go Billy!

39:35.644 --> 39:37.590
Oh, yeah, so that head
injury, like, I had...

39:37.646 --> 39:39.057
I was playing football.
I got a head injury.

39:39.081 --> 39:40.788
You're completely
out of it, Harley.

39:40.849 --> 39:42.160
What'? You're
completely out of it.

39:42.184 --> 39:44.186
No, no. You just zone out.

39:44.253 --> 39:46.062
No, I...

39:46.121 --> 39:48.123
Huh'? What'?

39:48.157 --> 39:49.192
Are you... What'?

39:49.258 --> 39:51.101
We shouldn't even be here.
What'? What'?

39:51.160 --> 39:53.606
<i>And besides, What?</i>

39:53.629 --> 39:56.610
I got two tickets to the
Shades concert this Wednesday.

39:56.632 --> 39:59.203
Front row seats. Sorry, doofus!

39:59.268 --> 40:01.646
Hey, watch your language.
This is a lady.

40:01.704 --> 40:03.682
Oh, yeah'? What are you
going to do about it, huh'?

40:03.706 --> 40:05.344
Ha ha, you hear that, Harley?

40:05.608 --> 40:06.313
<i>What?</i>

40:06.375 --> 40:08.355
You know,

40:08.611 --> 40:10.750
I could make one phone call

40:10.813 --> 40:12.815
and you could be
someone of the past, gone.

40:12.881 --> 40:15.088
Poof. Who are you
going to call'?

40:15.150 --> 40:16.959
The...

40:17.019 --> 40:18.760
History Channel?

40:20.222 --> 40:21.929
Someone stole
a town statue. Come on!

40:26.695 --> 40:28.231
<i>Billy!</i>

40:29.098 --> 40:30.771
I will get you, Billy.

40:31.900 --> 40:33.174
Hey.

40:35.971 --> 40:37.951
Hey, wait, this is...

40:38.007 --> 40:39.315
This is the clue. This is...

40:39.375 --> 40:41.787
Listen, I found the clue.

40:41.810 --> 40:42.810
I found it!

40:42.845 --> 40:44.324
Come on, let's go! Come on!

40:46.815 --> 40:48.021
Let's go! Now!

40:50.152 --> 40:54.225
All right. It's got to be
somewhere around here.

40:54.289 --> 40:56.826
Do you guys think the cops
have any idea who stole this'?

40:56.892 --> 40:58.269
Wait, you guys stole it'?

40:58.327 --> 41:00.671
I thought you said
you guys were borrowing it.

41:00.696 --> 41:02.266
Whoa, whoa, it's not stealing

41:02.331 --> 41:03.674
if we plan to return it.

41:03.732 --> 41:06.110
Yeah. Yeah.

41:06.168 --> 41:08.842
Just try not to get your
fingerprints all over it, guys.

41:08.904 --> 41:10.212
Oh, what'?

41:10.272 --> 41:12.252
I watch OS! And Oops.

41:12.307 --> 41:14.719
We never getaway.

41:14.777 --> 41:16.256
That has
nothing to do with this.

41:16.311 --> 41:19.087
Tiffany is just mad because
she never has this much fun.

41:19.148 --> 41:21.094
I mean,
have you seen her brother?

41:21.116 --> 41:22.720
He's all like...

41:22.785 --> 41:24.389
Yeah, he's all...

41:26.388 --> 41:28.163
That's a... That's a sheep.

41:28.223 --> 41:29.930
Don't look freaked out, Tiffany.

41:29.992 --> 41:32.170
Just think about all the money
that we're going to split.

41:32.194 --> 41:34.731
Hey, who said anything about
splitting the money with the girls?

41:34.797 --> 41:36.105
Shht! Hey, hey...

41:36.165 --> 41:37.165
Shht, shht!

41:37.199 --> 41:38.940
Hey, hey, hey.

41:40.202 --> 41:41.306
I found something.

41:41.370 --> 41:44.146
Look what I found.
What is that'?

41:44.206 --> 41:46.311
<i>Hoo! What is that?</i>

41:46.375 --> 41:48.855
<i>I don't know but this
has made us more friends.</i>

41:48.877 --> 41:50.720
Are those numbers?

41:50.779 --> 41:53.259
Hey!

41:53.315 --> 41:54.419
Hey, Dad.

41:54.483 --> 41:56.326
<i>We were...</i>

41:56.385 --> 41:58.729
We're just...
What are you rats doing?

42:00.422 --> 42:02.868
We were... We were just...

42:02.891 --> 42:06.429
Well, well, well.

42:06.495 --> 42:09.305
Looks like my son does have
some brains after all.

42:09.364 --> 42:10.399
Hey, hey.

42:10.466 --> 42:11.877
Partner. Yeah.

42:11.934 --> 42:14.778
Who knew my kid had a brain?
Well, I do.

42:14.837 --> 42:16.180
What's the deal with the statue?

42:16.238 --> 42:18.741
I don't know. It's a statue.

42:18.807 --> 42:21.048
Actually, I did...
I found this ring.

42:21.110 --> 42:23.090
I think it's Mr. Whittmore's.

42:23.145 --> 42:24.317
It has numbers on it.

42:24.379 --> 42:26.825
You know what that looks
like to me'? Huh'?

42:26.882 --> 42:28.884
A whole lot of nothing.

42:28.951 --> 42:30.453
But you know what'?

42:30.519 --> 42:32.328
Between the five brain cells
you have here

42:32.387 --> 42:33.764
I think you'll figure it out.

42:33.822 --> 42:35.233
We will.

42:35.290 --> 42:36.928
Yeah, or end up in jail.

42:39.128 --> 42:41.369
Excuse me'?

42:41.430 --> 42:43.068
Who's this'?

42:43.132 --> 42:45.476
Who'? Her'? She's...

42:45.534 --> 42:46.911
A friend.

42:49.037 --> 42:50.175
Come here.

42:52.541 --> 42:55.044
What have I told
you about pretty girls?

42:57.346 --> 42:59.348
Don't trust them.

42:59.414 --> 43:01.189
And watch your credit cards.

43:01.216 --> 43:03.787
Okay.

43:03.852 --> 43:06.093
Noodle. Noodle.

43:06.155 --> 43:09.193
<i>Use sunscreen today'? Yeah.</i>

43:09.258 --> 43:10.498
Use sunscreen.

43:10.559 --> 43:12.334
All right. Nice to meet you.

43:15.230 --> 43:17.403
Listen. It says
when the heavens open up,

43:17.466 --> 43:19.139
it reveals a truth

43:19.201 --> 43:21.408
even through the mark'?

43:21.470 --> 43:24.508
I think it has something to do with
the sun reflecting off the water.

43:25.941 --> 43:27.318
Guys, look.

43:27.376 --> 43:29.083
It's Mr. Whittmore's
floating dock.

43:29.111 --> 43:32.524
Hey, you think that's it, Albie'?
Maybe.

43:32.581 --> 43:35.152
<i>Wait, guys. Catch it for me.
Catch it for me.</i>

43:35.217 --> 43:37.219
I think I can get it. All
right, there you go.

43:37.252 --> 43:38.856
I think I've got it.

43:38.921 --> 43:40.195
Careful. We've got it.

43:41.356 --> 43:43.393
<i>There you go, okay.</i>

43:43.458 --> 43:45.267
Vinny, Vinny.
I'm getting on, too.

43:45.327 --> 43:47.000
Okay, now Eddie. There you go.

43:47.062 --> 43:49.133
<i>All right, I got it. Go for if.</i>

43:49.198 --> 43:51.872
Ask Albie. Albie, what are we
supposed to be looking for'?

43:51.934 --> 43:53.538
This box, I think. I don't know.

43:53.602 --> 43:55.138
Just something.

43:56.872 --> 43:58.215
That's so pretty!

44:00.409 --> 44:03.253
Winnie! Winnie!
Where did she go'?

44:03.312 --> 44:05.383
Winnie! Winnie! She jumped in.

44:05.447 --> 44:08.121
<i>Winnie! Winnie!</i>

44:08.183 --> 44:09.025
Winnie!

44:09.084 --> 44:10.188
Winnie.

44:15.991 --> 44:18.904
How long was that'? How long
did I hold my breath for'?

44:18.961 --> 44:21.066
Really?

44:22.965 --> 44:23.636
Okay. Whoa.

44:23.899 --> 44:26.038
Yes!

44:26.101 --> 44:27.944
Cannonball! Oh!

44:29.271 --> 44:30.545
Come on, Todd!

44:30.606 --> 44:32.449
All right, the more the merrier!
Here we go!

44:36.111 --> 44:37.954
Come on, Albie.
What's the hold up'?

44:38.013 --> 44:40.050
Yeah.

44:40.115 --> 44:42.891
I'm allergic to algae
and certain breeds of trout.

44:42.918 --> 44:45.023
Okay, hold on.

44:45.087 --> 44:47.431
I think I just kicked a fish.

44:47.489 --> 44:49.059
I just ate an hour ago.

44:49.124 --> 44:52.230
And I read something about how
you should let your food digest.

44:54.963 --> 44:56.067
Yay!

45:03.906 --> 45:05.044
I'm fine. I think I'm fine.

45:05.107 --> 45:06.381
I'm fine.

45:06.441 --> 45:07.920
Wait, there's something here.

45:17.119 --> 45:18.621
Where did Albie go'?

45:18.687 --> 45:19.687
Albie'? Albie'?

45:21.523 --> 45:23.332
Guys, guys, look.
I found something.

45:24.293 --> 45:25.293
What is it'?

45:30.432 --> 45:32.605
There we go. Okay.

45:32.668 --> 45:34.409
All right, what is it'?

45:34.469 --> 45:36.380
It's a box. I just found
it under the dock.

45:36.438 --> 45:38.349
<i>Guys, this could be it.</i>

45:38.373 --> 45:40.046
Like a movie. Open it up.

45:40.108 --> 45:42.349
Let's see what's inside the
box, inside the boxie.

45:42.411 --> 45:45.085
It's another box. What'?

45:45.147 --> 45:46.717
Is that real gold? Looks to be.

45:49.451 --> 45:51.658
<i>Is there any way?</i>

45:51.720 --> 45:53.427
Wait.

45:53.488 --> 45:55.468
Wait, there's something here.

45:55.524 --> 45:58.528
It... I can't read it.
I can't make it out.

45:58.593 --> 46:01.233
Don't worry. We'll find
out a way to open it.

46:04.166 --> 46:06.168
Hello, Culver, Daisy Larson here

46:06.234 --> 46:09.238
reporting to you live
from the Lake Fest Talent Show.

46:09.304 --> 46:11.648
Five minutes to show time!

46:11.673 --> 46:13.380
Hey, come on, guys. Have a seat.

46:13.442 --> 46:14.716
Get in, get in.

46:14.977 --> 46:15.978
Come on.

46:17.512 --> 46:19.492
Okay, here we go.

46:19.548 --> 46:21.528
It's exciting.

46:21.583 --> 46:23.722
Albie.

46:25.053 --> 46:26.053
What'?

46:26.621 --> 46:27.998
Come here.

46:31.293 --> 46:33.170
What'?

46:33.228 --> 46:34.639
Do you know how to
open the case yet'?

46:34.663 --> 46:36.267
No, I'm not going to pull it out

46:36.331 --> 46:38.538
in front of all these people,
but I'm working on it.

46:38.600 --> 46:40.546
Pssssstttt, be gone!

46:40.602 --> 46:43.606
Mr. Savage, I would
think that a talented...

46:43.672 --> 46:45.743
Scratch that, a classic
performer like yourself

46:46.008 --> 46:48.682
would adhere
to the time-honored tradition

46:48.744 --> 46:52.692
of keeping the show
behind the curtain

46:52.748 --> 46:56.161
until it's ready to begin.
Sorry, Mr. Riggs.

47:02.090 --> 47:04.161
Mr. Hanson, are you
Marilyn or Madonna,

47:04.192 --> 47:06.172
because that mole
is inexplicable.

47:06.194 --> 47:07.673
I told you.

47:09.531 --> 47:12.171
Hi. Are you nervous?

47:12.234 --> 47:13.474
Yeah, kind of.

47:13.535 --> 47:15.310
Good.

47:15.337 --> 47:16.645
I mean, you should be.

47:16.705 --> 47:19.413
Because if you're bad today,

47:19.474 --> 47:21.317
you know we can't
hang out anymore, right'?

47:23.545 --> 47:26.185
Why'? You should know, Tiffany.

47:26.248 --> 47:27.522
Image is everything.

47:27.582 --> 47:31.052
But look on the bright side.

47:31.119 --> 47:32.530
If you do suck,

47:32.587 --> 47:34.191
at least you have
your little brother

47:34.256 --> 47:37.362
and all of his friends
you can hang outwith.

47:37.426 --> 47:38.803
I'll take that back.

47:40.762 --> 47:42.764
And you should probably
fix your hair.

47:42.831 --> 47:45.471
It looks a little...

47:45.534 --> 47:47.480
Well, good luck.

48:00.348 --> 48:04.228
Greetings! Greetings, Culver.

48:04.286 --> 48:07.096
Welcome to the talent show.

48:07.155 --> 48:10.602
My name is Ryan Riggs.

48:10.659 --> 48:14.471
Thank you. Lam the
director of the show.

48:14.529 --> 48:16.270
And before we begin,

48:16.331 --> 48:18.311
I would just like
to start off by saying

48:18.366 --> 48:21.245
a little something
that I prepared.

48:22.737 --> 48:26.184
The magic doesn't begin

48:26.241 --> 48:28.152
until the audience has arrived.

48:31.613 --> 48:33.650
That's you. You're the magic.

48:35.484 --> 48:36.792
Okay, all right.

48:36.818 --> 48:39.799
First up, we have...

48:39.855 --> 48:42.426
Eddie Savage. If we could
have a big round of applause

48:42.491 --> 48:43.663
for Eddie Savage.

48:43.692 --> 48:46.400
Eddie!

48:46.461 --> 48:48.532
Yeah!

48:48.563 --> 48:50.474
Don't mess this up for me.

48:50.532 --> 48:52.205
I won't, sir.

48:52.267 --> 48:53.610
Okay.

48:53.668 --> 48:57.480
Ladies and gentlemen of Culver,

48:57.539 --> 48:59.815
my first magic trick,

48:59.875 --> 49:02.481
I'm going to cook a chicken

49:02.544 --> 49:04.319
inside of my hat.

49:04.379 --> 49:07.155
<i>Oh, okay. That's a new one.</i>

49:13.255 --> 49:15.428
Just need to tenderize
the meat a little bit.

49:26.701 --> 49:31.207
Now, with the wave
of my magic wand,

49:31.273 --> 49:35.187
I will turn this raw chicken

49:35.243 --> 49:36.745
into a cooked chicken.

49:44.853 --> 49:46.696
<i>Eww!</i>

49:46.755 --> 49:48.234
<i>Come on!</i>

49:48.290 --> 49:49.667
Yeah.

49:49.724 --> 49:53.467
Well, that was
such a good attempt.

49:53.495 --> 49:56.237
Yay! Whoo! Such
great effort, yeah!

49:56.298 --> 49:57.743
Let me try that again.

49:57.766 --> 50:00.872
I probably didn't
tenderize it enough.

50:00.936 --> 50:02.540
Okay.

50:04.506 --> 50:07.749
Happy, laugh.

50:07.809 --> 50:09.516
He is so funny.

50:09.578 --> 50:12.354
Wow. Oh, wow.

50:12.414 --> 50:18.228
Let's have another round of applause
for Eddie Savage and his chicken.

50:19.721 --> 50:21.428
Yeah.

50:21.489 --> 50:24.902
Oh. That's a little harsh.

50:24.960 --> 50:28.908
All right, next up we have...
Cheryl.

50:28.930 --> 50:30.910
We have...

50:30.966 --> 50:32.775
Tiffany Peterson.

50:32.834 --> 50:34.836
A big hand for Tiffany Peterson.

52:42.931 --> 52:44.933
What'? It's opening!

52:47.068 --> 52:50.982
We found the key! Wha'?

52:51.039 --> 52:53.815
I am not surprised.

52:53.875 --> 52:55.047
Is that the Whittmore key'?

52:58.713 --> 53:01.057
Tiffany, we've got to go.

53:01.082 --> 53:03.653
Um, yeah, okay.

53:03.718 --> 53:05.664
Seriously, like, everybody
is waiting on you.

53:05.687 --> 53:07.394
Oh, my gosh.

53:07.455 --> 53:09.033
My brother is blowing up
Twitter right now.

53:09.057 --> 53:10.559
Okay, whatever.
We have to go now.

53:10.625 --> 53:11.695
Seriously. But...

53:11.760 --> 53:13.535
Hey, what's your name, kid'?

53:13.595 --> 53:14.938
Albie Peterson.

53:14.963 --> 53:16.533
And what's that
you've got there'?

53:16.598 --> 53:18.077
The key
to Mr. Whittmore's treasure.

53:18.133 --> 53:19.544
How did you find it'?

53:19.601 --> 53:20.841
I figured out the clues.

53:20.902 --> 53:22.813
Well, was it difficult'?

53:22.837 --> 53:25.408
No, not if you're smart like me.

53:25.473 --> 53:26.952
Well, you heard
it here first, folks.

53:27.008 --> 53:28.851
Albie Peterson has found the key

53:28.910 --> 53:31.550
to the mysterious
Whittmore treasure.

53:31.613 --> 53:34.025
How are you going
to find the treasure?

53:34.082 --> 53:35.925
I'll figure it out.

53:35.984 --> 53:39.796
Oh, things are about
to get real.

53:42.690 --> 53:44.170
Why are you writing
that down, Cheryl?

53:44.426 --> 53:45.427
That's just weird.

53:45.493 --> 53:47.131
Don't write everything I say.

53:49.831 --> 53:52.038
Mr. Mayor, read it and weep.

53:52.100 --> 53:53.909
I've got court papers here

53:53.968 --> 53:55.777
that say that
your little treasure hunt

53:55.837 --> 53:57.839
is going to have
to come to a stop.

53:57.906 --> 53:59.977
Oh, you sail'?

54:00.008 --> 54:01.646
Yes, I do.

54:01.709 --> 54:02.269
<i>Oh, very nice.</i>

54:02.444 --> 54:04.856
Oh, do you have boat insurance?

54:04.913 --> 54:07.189
Boat insurance, who doesn't
have boat insurance?

54:07.449 --> 54:08.655
Ringo Fink, here's my card.

54:08.716 --> 54:10.627
Premiums are at an
all-time high right now,

54:10.685 --> 54:13.063
but I'd be happy to hook you up.

54:13.121 --> 54:15.727
We all live in a yellow
submarine after all.

54:15.790 --> 54:16.894
I don't understand.

54:16.958 --> 54:18.460
You don't understand?

54:18.493 --> 54:19.631
Well, understand this, sir.

54:19.694 --> 54:20.866
Your little treasure hunt'?

54:20.929 --> 54:23.466
Yeah, there's a land dispute
that goes back about three years

54:23.531 --> 54:25.511
between my client,
Fritz Bronson,

54:25.567 --> 54:26.568
and a Mr. Whittmore.

54:26.634 --> 54:28.511
Why was it never settled?

54:28.570 --> 54:30.550
I resent your tone, sir,
if you're trying to imply

54:30.605 --> 54:32.676
that I have not done my due
diligence as a lawyer.

54:32.740 --> 54:34.617
Jurisprudence... Please, please.

54:34.642 --> 54:36.212
Get the point, Mr. Fink.

54:36.478 --> 54:39.186
I'll get to the point,
Mr. Mayor.

54:39.247 --> 54:40.954
If this little treasure of yours

54:41.015 --> 54:43.017
is found on land
that is owned by my client

54:43.051 --> 54:44.621
or Mr. Whittmore,

54:44.652 --> 54:46.495
well then, sir,
we have a problem

54:46.554 --> 54:47.862
because...

54:47.922 --> 54:50.198
We're going to have to put
a stop to the whole thing

54:50.258 --> 54:51.760
until we can all come together.

54:51.826 --> 54:53.169
Do you like movies?

54:53.228 --> 54:54.639
Do you like comedies?

54:54.696 --> 54:56.039
Well, this one is not funny.

54:56.097 --> 54:57.940
It's a scary movie.

54:57.999 --> 55:01.105
Push pause. Push pause.

55:01.169 --> 55:02.978
No treasure, pause.

55:03.037 --> 55:04.983
Huh'? Huh'?

55:05.039 --> 55:07.110
We can shoot some hoops
some other time.

55:08.910 --> 55:11.652
Can you stop us from
looking for the clues'?

55:11.679 --> 55:14.216
No, but we could get
into a lot of trouble

55:14.282 --> 55:16.956
for stepping foot
on any of Whittmore's land.

55:17.018 --> 55:20.727
Bronson is just upset that Billy
didn't find the key first.

55:20.788 --> 55:22.290
What about the missing statue?

55:22.557 --> 55:24.134
Aren't they going to
find out who took it'?

55:24.158 --> 55:27.230
It is a little bit strange,
isn't it'?

55:27.295 --> 55:29.707
Why would Mr. Bronson want
to stop the treasure hunt'?

55:29.764 --> 55:32.267
Well, after Mr. Bronson

55:32.534 --> 55:35.208
sold Mr. Whittmore
the root beer stand,

55:35.270 --> 55:37.614
those two never
really got along.

55:37.672 --> 55:38.980
What happened?

55:39.040 --> 55:42.544
Well, after loaning
Mr. Bronson the money

55:42.610 --> 55:43.987
<i>to build the root bee! Stand,</i>

55:44.045 --> 55:47.219
<i>Mr. Whittmore hired him
as a financial advisor.</i>

55:47.282 --> 55:49.125
<i>Months later, he found out
that Mr. Bronson</i>

55:49.183 --> 55:51.595
<i>had started stealing
from the company.</i>

55:51.653 --> 55:53.633
I cannot tell you
how disappointed I am

55:53.688 --> 55:54.689
in you, Fritz.

55:54.756 --> 55:57.100
I almost can't look
at you, Fritz.

55:57.158 --> 55:58.330
Do you know why are you here?

55:58.593 --> 56:01.039
<i>Uh, no. Oh, I think you do.</i>

56:01.095 --> 56:03.234
I think you do.

56:04.832 --> 56:05.902
Does that look familiar?

56:06.768 --> 56:09.044
Not really. I...

56:09.103 --> 56:11.913
These signatures,
these initials?

56:11.973 --> 56:13.714
No.

56:13.741 --> 56:14.919
The accounting ledger that shows

56:14.943 --> 56:16.183
that you stole money from me'?

56:16.244 --> 56:18.281
It says Frank. That's not Fritz.

56:19.847 --> 56:22.851
That's the worst lie I think
I've ever heard in my life.

56:22.917 --> 56:24.260
Hey, I...

56:24.285 --> 56:25.992
Get out of my sight.

56:30.892 --> 56:33.236
You had so much potential.

56:44.072 --> 56:45.642
Sorry.

56:48.009 --> 56:49.750
Everybody makes mistakes.

56:49.811 --> 56:51.313
We do. We do.

56:51.379 --> 56:55.020
I'm going to help you
make it right.

56:55.083 --> 56:57.927
<i>Instead of firing
Fritz and taking him to court,</i>

56:57.986 --> 57:00.023
<i>Mr. Whittmore forgave him.</i>

57:00.088 --> 57:02.159
<i>But there was one condition.</i>

57:02.223 --> 57:03.702
What was that'?

57:03.758 --> 57:06.705
That Mr. Bronson donate
his entire Christmas bonus

57:06.761 --> 57:09.332
<i>to a charity in town.
Thank you, Santa.</i>

57:09.397 --> 57:11.206
<i>Mr. Whittmore was
sad when he found out</i>

57:11.265 --> 57:13.643
<i>that Fritz had not carried through
with his request.</i>

57:13.668 --> 57:15.773
Lam so majorly
disappointed in you.

57:15.837 --> 57:16.941
<i>And he fired him.</i>

57:17.005 --> 57:19.918
Well, you know what happens now.

57:19.941 --> 57:21.249
You're fired.

57:21.309 --> 57:24.188
Man, I... I don't want the job.

57:30.151 --> 57:31.960
So why did he come back'?

57:32.020 --> 57:35.797
Well, to get his greedy little
hands on the Whittmore treasure.

57:35.857 --> 57:37.268
I hate that man.

57:37.325 --> 57:39.805
Hey, we don't hate
people, okay, guys'?

57:40.862 --> 57:42.933
We just get...

57:42.964 --> 57:46.002
excruciatingly
disappointed in them.

57:46.067 --> 57:48.245
We're going to find that treasure,
and I'll tell you why.

57:48.269 --> 57:50.715
Mr. Whittmore didn't want
Mr. Bronson to have it.

57:55.109 --> 57:57.146
Yeah, and then
he wanted to go fishing.

57:57.211 --> 57:59.885
Can you believe it'?

57:59.947 --> 58:01.358
Nope.

58:01.382 --> 58:03.919
<i>Nice.</i>

58:03.985 --> 58:06.431
Yeah.

58:09.757 --> 58:11.828
Well, you're awkwardly
quiet tonight.

58:14.062 --> 58:17.100
But I thought you said we were
going to go to a concert tonight.

58:17.165 --> 58:18.371
Yeah, I know. I just...

58:18.433 --> 58:20.208
I thought we could have
some alone time.

58:20.268 --> 58:22.407
And I don't want to hear
that suck music anymore.

58:25.940 --> 58:27.214
Billy, take me home.

58:28.976 --> 58:30.182
What'?

58:30.244 --> 58:31.848
Take me home, Billy.

58:31.913 --> 58:34.792
What'? C-come on! Tiffany?

58:34.849 --> 58:37.386
Okay, I think you're cool.

58:37.452 --> 58:39.261
You know, I know
there's really not...

58:39.287 --> 58:41.460
an adjective
that can describe me.

58:41.723 --> 58:43.293
I can think of a few.

58:44.992 --> 58:46.198
I know what you're thinking.

58:50.198 --> 58:52.007
Kissable.

58:53.835 --> 58:54.973
Hmm?

59:13.254 --> 59:14.790
What the...

59:17.058 --> 59:19.766
Sorry. Oh, you think
that's funny'?

59:19.827 --> 59:22.068
Okay, we'll see how funny
it is when you walk home.

59:26.300 --> 59:28.041
Okay. Gosh.

59:36.844 --> 59:38.790
Perfect.

59:38.813 --> 59:40.087
Just perfect.

59:45.319 --> 59:46.263
Um.

59:46.320 --> 59:48.357
Hi.

59:48.422 --> 59:49.457
Hey.

59:51.926 --> 59:54.065
Can I get a ride'?

59:55.563 --> 59:56.507
A ride'?

59:56.564 --> 59:58.305
Yeah.

59:58.366 --> 01:00:01.404
In your car. Yeah, of course.

01:00:01.469 --> 01:00:03.881
Thanks. To Jackie's. Jackie's'?

01:00:03.938 --> 01:00:06.214
Uh-huh, yeah, so...

01:00:06.274 --> 01:00:07.947
Thanks. Sorry.

01:00:07.975 --> 01:00:09.386
Mm-hmm. Yeah, this way, okay.

01:00:09.443 --> 01:00:10.854
Yep.

01:00:33.301 --> 01:00:34.974
Your hair is good.

01:00:35.036 --> 01:00:36.845
What'?

01:00:45.246 --> 01:00:46.850
Your face is pretty.

01:00:48.883 --> 01:00:51.227
Um...

01:00:54.422 --> 01:00:56.925
It's a night nice.

01:00:56.991 --> 01:00:59.130
Huh'? I'm sorry.

01:00:59.193 --> 01:01:01.173
It's a... It's a nice night.

01:01:01.229 --> 01:01:03.004
Oh.

01:01:03.064 --> 01:01:04.236
I guess so.

01:01:20.281 --> 01:01:23.490
Thanks for giving me
a ride, Todd.

01:01:23.551 --> 01:01:26.327
It was my pleasure.

01:01:26.387 --> 01:01:27.559
Okay.

01:01:29.390 --> 01:01:31.165
Um, uh...

01:01:31.192 --> 01:01:33.900
Uh, Tiffany!

01:01:33.928 --> 01:01:36.033
Yeah.

01:01:36.063 --> 01:01:39.169
You are far more extraordinary
than people give you credit for.

01:01:40.902 --> 01:01:42.904
Just thought you should know.

01:01:44.939 --> 01:01:46.475
<i>Night.</i>

01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:48.178
Night.

01:02:04.558 --> 01:02:06.333
Whew.

01:02:12.233 --> 01:02:13.268
Can I come in'?

01:02:14.702 --> 01:02:16.272
Sure.

01:02:18.105 --> 01:02:20.483
So how does it feel

01:02:20.508 --> 01:02:23.079
to be a celebrity?

01:02:23.144 --> 01:02:24.350
You should know.

01:02:26.414 --> 01:02:28.360
Did you like my song'?

01:02:28.416 --> 01:02:30.089
You were amazing.

01:02:32.453 --> 01:02:34.126
Hey, did you find
the next clue'?

01:02:34.188 --> 01:02:38.568
No, but this chapter,
it's on geography.

01:02:38.626 --> 01:02:41.038
It talks about the geographic
coordinates system.

01:02:43.597 --> 01:02:45.440
Every location on Earth
can be located

01:02:45.499 --> 01:02:47.103
using a set of numbers.

01:02:47.168 --> 01:02:49.170
I think Whittmore
hid the treasure

01:02:49.236 --> 01:02:50.977
using the coordinates system.

01:02:51.038 --> 01:02:54.281
I just have to locate
the numbers.

01:02:54.342 --> 01:02:56.151
Billy Bronson stole
the town statue.

01:02:56.210 --> 01:02:57.746
What'?

01:02:58.012 --> 01:02:59.047
I was there.

01:02:59.113 --> 01:03:00.387
It's in his garage.

01:03:00.448 --> 01:03:02.018
This is huge!

01:03:02.083 --> 01:03:03.391
Shh, Aunt Jackie is sleeping.

01:03:03.451 --> 01:03:04.691
Come on.

01:03:07.054 --> 01:03:09.261
Maybe the coordinates
are in the statute.

01:03:09.290 --> 01:03:11.668
Well, on the statue's ring, actually.

01:03:11.692 --> 01:03:14.263
The statue was wearing this ring
that had a set of numbers on it.

01:03:14.328 --> 01:03:15.705
It was wearing a ring'?

01:03:15.763 --> 01:03:17.401
I know it sounds silly.

01:03:17.465 --> 01:03:19.445
But Billy actually noticed it

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:21.537
and thought the numbers
might be significant.

01:03:21.569 --> 01:03:23.549
So he...

01:03:23.604 --> 01:03:25.550
He put the ring on his necklace.

01:03:25.606 --> 01:03:27.210
Billy wears a necklace?

01:03:27.274 --> 01:03:28.685
What's with men and jewelry?

01:03:28.709 --> 01:03:30.347
And I get teased
for being a dork'?

01:03:30.411 --> 01:03:34.188
Albie, we have to get
that necklace back.

01:03:34.248 --> 01:03:36.250
We need to find
the treasure, not Billy.

01:03:37.251 --> 01:03:39.231
We'd better call the Savages.

01:03:42.356 --> 01:03:43.460
Where are we'?

01:03:43.524 --> 01:03:45.367
They... they told me
to meet them here.

01:03:45.426 --> 01:03:46.769
We've got to be discreet.

01:03:49.263 --> 01:03:51.038
Come on.

01:03:51.098 --> 01:03:52.338
Come on!

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:54.107
You're fine.

01:03:54.168 --> 01:03:55.374
I just did my nails.

01:03:55.436 --> 01:03:56.608
You're fine.

01:03:56.670 --> 01:03:58.650
The things I do for you, Albie.

01:03:58.706 --> 01:03:59.810
<i>My goodness.</i>

01:04:00.074 --> 01:04:02.213
<i>- Is this thing even safe?
- Yep.</i>

01:04:02.276 --> 01:04:05.120
Let the meeting begin.

01:04:10.551 --> 01:04:12.792
Oh, stop with the smoochy-poo.

01:04:16.157 --> 01:04:17.795
I would like to welcome you,

01:04:18.059 --> 01:04:20.061
our newest member, Tiffany...

01:04:22.096 --> 01:04:24.133
<i>who's been giving us
important information.</i>

01:04:24.198 --> 01:04:25.268
We are now back on track

01:04:25.332 --> 01:04:27.471
to uncovering
the Whittmore treasure.

01:04:27.535 --> 01:04:30.345
<i>Tiffany, hand out
the packets I prepared.</i>

01:04:30.404 --> 01:04:32.748
Thank you.

01:04:32.773 --> 01:04:34.753
And one for you.

01:04:34.809 --> 01:04:36.152
How professional.

01:04:36.210 --> 01:04:38.212
Um, uh, excuse me.

01:04:38.279 --> 01:04:39.553
What's this'?

01:04:39.613 --> 01:04:41.524
I don't do well with puzzles.

01:04:41.582 --> 01:04:43.619
Yeah. It goes like this.

01:04:43.684 --> 01:04:45.425
So basically, you're telling me

01:04:45.486 --> 01:04:46.829
that we need to find a ring

01:04:47.088 --> 01:04:49.090
with numbers on it
in order to find the treasure.

01:04:49.156 --> 01:04:52.228
Yep. Now, where's the
part about revenge?

01:04:52.293 --> 01:04:53.795
Page 23.

01:04:53.861 --> 01:04:56.273
Oh. Oh.

01:04:56.330 --> 01:04:58.173
That's the response
I was looking for.

01:04:58.232 --> 01:04:59.267
I like this page.

01:05:00.835 --> 01:05:03.441
Movie night on the boat.

01:05:03.504 --> 01:05:06.576
I love seeing movies on the boat.
I drew that.

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:08.415
Tomorrow night,
Tiffany will call Billy

01:05:08.476 --> 01:05:10.319
<i>and apologize for being a brat.</i>

01:05:10.377 --> 01:05:12.323
Billy'? Hey.

01:05:12.379 --> 01:05:13.824
I just wanted to say I'm sorry

01:05:13.881 --> 01:05:15.724
for being such a brat
the other night.

01:05:15.783 --> 01:05:18.195
And didn't know if maybe

01:05:18.252 --> 01:05:20.698
you wanted to go see
a movie on the boat tonight?

01:05:22.556 --> 01:05:24.729
All right, right there.

01:05:29.497 --> 01:05:32.137
<i>She?! look if
he's wearing the necklace</i>

01:05:32.166 --> 01:05:33.543
<i>or not wearing the necklace.</i>

01:05:36.437 --> 01:05:38.781
Sparkly Whale,
come in, Sparkly Whale.

01:05:38.839 --> 01:05:40.341
This is the Great Houdini.

01:05:40.407 --> 01:05:41.818
Sparkly Whale'?

01:05:41.876 --> 01:05:45.289
That's your code name, remember?
No, no, no.

01:05:45.312 --> 01:05:48.259
Sparkly Whale is definitely
not going to work for me.

01:05:48.315 --> 01:05:49.316
Ow.

01:05:49.383 --> 01:05:51.158
You okay'? Oh. Yeah.

01:05:51.185 --> 01:05:53.461
Sorry, my back.
I'm just stretching.

01:05:53.521 --> 01:05:55.694
Oh, yeah, that happens to me.
It hurts.

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:01.333
<i>In case the
necklace is not on him,</i>

01:06:01.395 --> 01:06:03.170
<i>Winnie and Vinny
will create a diversion</i>

01:06:03.197 --> 01:06:05.302
<i>to get Billy's house keys.</i>

01:06:05.366 --> 01:06:07.243
Oh, come on, wife.

01:06:07.301 --> 01:06:08.302
I'm coming!

01:06:08.369 --> 01:06:09.712
<i>Come on!</i>

01:06:09.770 --> 01:06:12.341
What should I do'?

01:06:14.808 --> 01:06:16.446
Excuse me. Could you guys move?

01:06:16.510 --> 01:06:18.387
Oh, deary me.

01:06:18.445 --> 01:06:20.857
What was that,
young whippersnapper'?

01:06:20.881 --> 01:06:22.758
I can't see the screen.

01:06:22.816 --> 01:06:25.592
Oh, what... What did he say'?

01:06:25.619 --> 01:06:27.724
I can't hear without my glasses.
I need my glasses.

01:06:27.755 --> 01:06:30.463
Your glasses are on your... Oh!
I can't see.

01:06:30.524 --> 01:06:33.801
<i>While Vinny and
Winnie are distracting Billy,</i>

01:06:33.861 --> 01:06:35.738
<i>Tiffany will grab the keys.</i>

01:06:35.796 --> 01:06:37.332
They're staying.

01:06:37.398 --> 01:06:39.844
Tiffany, are you prepared to do

01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:41.811
<i>what you need to do
to distract Billy?</i>

01:06:41.869 --> 01:06:43.371
What are you implying?

01:06:51.412 --> 01:06:52.412
Wow.

01:06:52.446 --> 01:06:54.426
Eww. There's got
to be another way.

01:06:56.450 --> 01:06:57.758
<i>Once Tiffany has the keys,</i>

01:06:57.785 --> 01:06:58.786
<i>she'll text us.</i>

01:06:58.852 --> 01:07:00.593
<i>Eddie and I will hop
on our Whaler</i>

01:07:00.654 --> 01:07:01.826
<i>to make our way to the boat.</i>

01:07:01.922 --> 01:07:04.926
Excuse me just one second.
Oh, yeah, fine.

01:07:09.330 --> 01:07:11.401
Hold on. This actually
sounds kind of dangerous.

01:07:11.465 --> 01:07:13.502
And your point being?

01:07:13.534 --> 01:07:15.377
Albie is not allergic to danger.

01:07:15.436 --> 01:07:18.576
He's allergic to metaphorical algae.

01:07:18.639 --> 01:07:20.915
<i>Eddie and I will
go lo the Bronson estate</i>

01:07:20.975 --> 01:07:22.420
<i>on the other side of the lake</i>

01:07:22.476 --> 01:07:23.511
<i>and break in.</i>

01:07:25.546 --> 01:07:27.617
There's a security guard. Hide.

01:07:44.665 --> 01:07:46.804
You know if this works
you'll be a genius, right'?

01:07:46.867 --> 01:07:48.403
I already am.

01:07:48.435 --> 01:07:49.812
That's my brother.

01:08:06.787 --> 01:08:10.325
Shh.

01:08:10.391 --> 01:08:11.836
Magic.

01:08:13.861 --> 01:08:16.569
This way.

01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:17.973
It's the maid. Go!

01:08:35.649 --> 01:08:38.630
You should stay here.

01:08:38.685 --> 01:08:39.926
I'll check the bathroom.

01:08:43.424 --> 01:08:44.493
What's this'?

01:08:44.558 --> 01:08:46.002
Ugh.

01:08:51.598 --> 01:08:52.770
Yes.

01:08:52.832 --> 01:08:54.073
Finally.

01:08:54.335 --> 01:08:55.335
What the heck?

01:08:55.368 --> 01:08:56.814
You would need this.

01:08:56.870 --> 01:08:59.680
Mr. Billy.

01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:01.879
I got pizza, your favorite.

01:09:03.344 --> 01:09:04.482
What do we do'?

01:09:05.612 --> 01:09:06.682
I don't know.

01:09:06.747 --> 01:09:07.747
I got the necklace.

01:09:07.814 --> 01:09:09.886
Mr. Billy'?

01:09:09.950 --> 01:09:11.429
Are you up here?

01:09:11.484 --> 01:09:13.055
Shh, be quiet.

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:14.758
Maybe she'll leave.

01:09:19.093 --> 01:09:21.595
What if she comes up here?

01:09:21.662 --> 01:09:23.140
<i>Mr. Billy,</i>

01:09:23.397 --> 01:09:25.569
<i>you never tum down pizza.
Are you okay?</i>

01:09:25.631 --> 01:09:29.478
I'll be down in a minute.

01:09:29.536 --> 01:09:30.640
What was that'?

01:09:31.872 --> 01:09:34.648
Okay, Mr. Billy.

01:09:36.377 --> 01:09:37.856
Now just get out of here.
Come on.

01:09:37.911 --> 01:09:39.082
Right.

01:09:41.782 --> 01:09:45.559
Other way, other way.

01:09:52.658 --> 01:09:54.069
I'll get you kids!

01:10:00.067 --> 01:10:01.569
Stop, you kids!

01:10:01.635 --> 01:10:02.943
Slow down!

01:10:03.003 --> 01:10:05.449
Get back here, kids!

01:10:05.506 --> 01:10:06.678
<i>Shut if down!</i>

01:10:08.075 --> 01:10:10.817
Now.

01:10:10.878 --> 01:10:15.588
Yeah, I don't think this
plan was very well thought through.

01:10:15.649 --> 01:10:16.957
<i>Get off the grass!</i>

01:10:17.017 --> 01:10:19.554
<i>Slow down, kids!</i>

01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:21.156
You kids get back here!

01:10:21.422 --> 01:10:24.130
Oh, this is intense.

01:10:24.191 --> 01:10:27.695
It sure is. It sure is, Grandpa.

01:10:32.566 --> 01:10:35.570
Albie, I'll distract him.

01:10:35.602 --> 01:10:36.603
You got the bow.

01:10:41.475 --> 01:10:44.718
Oh, great. Toxicodendron.

01:10:44.778 --> 01:10:47.725
<i>I shouldn't have
let him out of my sight.</i>

01:10:47.748 --> 01:10:50.888
You kids shouldn't have been over at
the Bronson's in the first place.

01:10:50.951 --> 01:10:52.521
It almost worked.

01:10:52.586 --> 01:10:54.463
I gave the performance
of my life.

01:10:55.989 --> 01:10:58.663
When was the last time
you saw Albie'?

01:10:58.725 --> 01:11:00.534
He headed off into the woods

01:11:00.594 --> 01:11:02.938
<i>after I lost the security guard.</i>

01:11:02.996 --> 01:11:05.499
I waited for him, but...

01:11:05.566 --> 01:11:06.738
he never came back.

01:11:09.870 --> 01:11:11.816
I shouldn't have let him
out of my sight.

01:11:22.683 --> 01:11:25.493
Can I... Can you just drop
me off at the marina'?

01:11:25.552 --> 01:11:31.161
Look who it is. Johnny Bigshot.

01:11:31.191 --> 01:11:34.536
What do you say you and I
have a little chat, huh'?

01:11:39.066 --> 01:11:40.545
Wait a minute. Give me that.

01:11:40.601 --> 01:11:41.636
Hey, that's mine.

01:11:41.702 --> 01:11:44.182
I could have you
arrested for this.

01:11:44.204 --> 01:11:45.239
That's stealing.

01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:49.045
<i>You don'! Look too good, buddy.</i>

01:11:49.109 --> 01:11:51.919
Holding onto that key has...

01:11:51.979 --> 01:11:54.050
not been very good
for you, has it'?

01:11:54.081 --> 01:11:57.085
Mr. Whittmore wanted me
to have the treasure.

01:11:57.150 --> 01:12:00.927
I can make your life
very uncomfortable.

01:12:00.954 --> 01:12:02.661
You hear me, short stuff'?

01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:08.731
<i>Fire! Excuse me'?</i>

01:12:08.795 --> 01:12:10.035
There's a fire!

01:12:10.097 --> 01:12:11.872
"What" hey!

01:12:11.932 --> 01:12:13.536
Hey, what did you do'?

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:16.012
Stop smoking.
It isn't good for you.

01:12:16.069 --> 01:12:18.015
It makes your teeth rot.

01:12:18.071 --> 01:12:19.812
<i>You come here, you little rat.</i>

01:12:19.873 --> 01:12:21.875
Hey! Ah!

01:12:21.942 --> 01:12:24.786
Ah, I just burned
my nuts. Dammit!

01:12:24.845 --> 01:12:27.086
Don't worry. Albie is
stronger than he looks.

01:12:27.147 --> 01:12:28.820
Last year
before his spelling bee,

01:12:28.882 --> 01:12:30.156
he got stung by a bee.

01:12:30.217 --> 01:12:31.890
Ironic, right'?

01:12:31.952 --> 01:12:33.761
O0. He still won, too.

01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:35.299
If you ever want to feel stupid,

01:12:35.556 --> 01:12:37.934
watch a six-year-old
spell "anesthetic" correctly.

01:12:37.991 --> 01:12:39.561
<i>Really? Mm-hmm. Yep.</i>

01:12:39.626 --> 01:12:41.066
Okay, you guys,
I can't wait anymore.

01:12:41.094 --> 01:12:43.254
Okay, I'm going to go look for him.
Yeah, I'll go, too.

01:12:43.297 --> 01:12:44.640
Okay, be careful.

01:12:46.066 --> 01:12:47.704
Albie?

01:12:47.734 --> 01:12:48.974
Albie! I got him. I got him.

01:12:49.036 --> 01:12:50.174
Get him. There we go, okay.

01:12:50.237 --> 01:12:51.237
Go, go, 9°-

01:12:57.644 --> 01:12:59.088
How long is this
going to take, lady'?

01:12:59.112 --> 01:13:01.319
I got people to sue.

01:13:01.582 --> 01:13:04.927
Mr. Fink, it is
a very busy morning.

01:13:04.985 --> 01:13:08.159
The treasure hunt
was just recently released.

01:13:08.221 --> 01:13:09.859
Released?

01:13:09.890 --> 01:13:12.131
What is she
talking about, released?

01:13:12.159 --> 01:13:14.036
Exciting, isn't it'?

01:13:14.094 --> 01:13:16.040
<i>What is this?</i>

01:13:16.096 --> 01:13:18.007
I'll be on my way.

01:13:18.065 --> 01:13:21.638
Hey, uh, we can shoot some
hoops later if you like.

01:13:21.702 --> 01:13:23.875
I'll see you in court.

01:13:23.904 --> 01:13:26.908
The basketball court.

01:13:44.157 --> 01:13:46.330
Hey.

01:13:46.393 --> 01:13:47.895
Boy genius.

01:13:47.928 --> 01:13:49.305
How you feeling?

01:13:49.363 --> 01:13:53.140
Jackie? Shh, it's okay.

01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:54.838
Just get some rest.

01:13:54.901 --> 01:13:57.177
We're here for you and
we're not going anywhere.

01:13:58.672 --> 01:14:01.243
The key. Don't worry.

01:14:01.308 --> 01:14:03.310
We're keeping it safe.

01:14:03.377 --> 01:14:07.223
Hey, I see you met a lot of
great friends out there.

01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:10.352
I read about this one guy who
died and came back to life.

01:14:10.417 --> 01:14:12.397
He said that heaven
was like a marshmallow.

01:14:12.653 --> 01:14:14.655
It was all puffy and sweet.

01:14:14.721 --> 01:14:16.997
Like me.

01:14:17.057 --> 01:14:19.799
How is he'? He'll be fine.

01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:22.136
Okay. Wait, what
about the treasure?

01:14:22.195 --> 01:14:24.368
The Bronsons still have
the coordinates.

01:14:41.848 --> 01:14:43.759
Here we go.

01:14:45.118 --> 01:14:46.859
What are you doing here, Billy'?

01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:48.560
What are you doing here, Billy'?

01:14:51.324 --> 01:14:54.362
Shh!

01:14:54.428 --> 01:14:56.408
We got a little bit
of a situation.

01:14:56.463 --> 01:14:58.409
You guys have the key.

01:14:58.465 --> 01:15:00.308
We have the coordinates.

01:15:00.367 --> 01:15:02.176
And without both, well...

01:15:02.235 --> 01:15:03.976
we're both screwed.

01:15:04.037 --> 01:15:06.984
What are you getting at, Billy'?

01:15:07.007 --> 01:15:10.045
Todd? Sweet Todd?

01:15:10.110 --> 01:15:11.885
Where did that edge come from'?

01:15:11.945 --> 01:15:12.945
What's your point'?

01:15:12.979 --> 01:15:15.255
He has one.

01:15:15.315 --> 01:15:16.919
Right'? Yeah.

01:15:16.983 --> 01:15:18.326
There is a 50/50 chance.

01:15:18.385 --> 01:15:20.126
Oh, those odds,
I like those odds.

01:15:20.187 --> 01:15:23.191
Of course I have
a point, idiots!

01:15:24.157 --> 01:15:26.398
Garrison?

01:15:27.994 --> 01:15:29.996
What's this'?
What, can't you read?

01:15:30.030 --> 01:15:33.443
Yeah, didn't you...
Didn't you go to...

01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:36.743
"The read" reading...
The reading school?

01:15:36.770 --> 01:15:38.443
Didn't you 90...

01:15:38.505 --> 01:15:40.007
Nice.

01:15:41.808 --> 01:15:42.946
Let's go.

01:15:43.009 --> 01:15:45.990
Catch you later. Hmm.

01:15:46.046 --> 01:15:47.286
Albie should see this.

01:15:47.347 --> 01:15:48.917
All right, come on, guys.

01:15:52.486 --> 01:15:54.796
<i>Harleyk!</i>

01:15:56.156 --> 01:15:57.362
Excuse me, Aunt Jackie. Yeah.

01:15:59.426 --> 01:16:00.769
Albie, look.

01:16:02.129 --> 01:16:03.233
What is it'?

01:16:03.296 --> 01:16:05.037
Well, it's a challenge.

01:16:05.065 --> 01:16:06.305
Read it.

01:16:07.834 --> 01:16:09.780
"You are amicably invited to..."

01:16:09.836 --> 01:16:10.974
I hate to interrupt,

01:16:11.037 --> 01:16:12.175
but I love challenges.

01:16:12.205 --> 01:16:13.206
Let's do it!

01:16:13.273 --> 01:16:14.843
You guys, look.

01:16:14.908 --> 01:16:16.319
I hate to be
the voice of reason,

01:16:16.343 --> 01:16:18.118
but these people
are shady, okay'?

01:16:18.178 --> 01:16:19.521
They're not to be trusted.

01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:20.986
Keep reading.

01:16:22.816 --> 01:16:24.921
"Bring your four best men."

01:16:24.951 --> 01:16:26.123
Or women.

01:16:26.186 --> 01:16:28.257
"We'll meet at sunrise."

01:16:28.321 --> 01:16:31.063
"The loser will relinquish their
half of the Whittmore puzzle."

01:16:31.124 --> 01:16:32.569
<i>The key.</i>

01:16:32.826 --> 01:16:34.237
"Sincerely, the Bronsons."

01:16:34.294 --> 01:16:36.001
The Bronsons, sincere?

01:16:36.062 --> 01:16:37.063
See, now that's a joke.

01:16:37.130 --> 01:16:39.132
It sounds fair.

01:16:39.199 --> 01:16:41.304
Yeah, if they played by the rules.
Yeah.

01:16:41.368 --> 01:16:43.006
What you think
we should do, Albie'?

01:16:43.069 --> 01:16:45.242
I think...

01:16:45.305 --> 01:16:47.216
we'd better get training.

01:16:49.009 --> 01:16:51.080
Go, go! You call that fast'?

01:16:51.144 --> 01:16:52.421
I know you can do
better than that!

01:16:52.445 --> 01:16:53.480
Come on, Eddie. Okay.

01:16:53.513 --> 01:16:55.083
Go, go, go!

01:16:58.251 --> 01:16:59.491
Move!

01:17:02.389 --> 01:17:04.995
Now try hardier.

01:17:05.058 --> 01:17:07.299
Go, go, go.

01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:09.135
I want 10 more! Come on! Go!

01:17:09.196 --> 01:17:10.504
Beat the tide!

01:17:10.564 --> 01:17:12.840
Come on! I know you can
go faster than that!

01:17:12.866 --> 01:17:14.243
Beat the tide!

01:17:14.267 --> 01:17:15.974
I'm not even going anywhere.

01:17:16.036 --> 01:17:17.276
Bigger strokes! Come on!

01:17:17.337 --> 01:17:18.179
You can beat it!

01:17:18.238 --> 01:17:19.273
Distract!

01:17:19.339 --> 01:17:21.114
Flirt! Work it.

01:17:21.174 --> 01:17:23.518
Whoever reaches me first
gets free ice cream.

01:17:23.577 --> 01:17:25.250
Come on, Eddie. Come on!

01:17:34.254 --> 01:17:37.133
Oh, Tiffany wins.

01:17:41.962 --> 01:17:44.909
I never thought
the day would come

01:17:44.965 --> 01:17:46.876
that I would be standing
in front of you,

01:17:46.933 --> 01:17:48.310
<i>all grown up,</i>

01:17:48.368 --> 01:17:51.008
telling you you're ready.

01:17:51.872 --> 01:17:53.010
<i>Whoa!</i>

01:17:54.608 --> 01:17:56.019
Eddie. Eddie?

01:17:56.042 --> 01:17:57.146
You okay'? Eddie.

01:18:07.020 --> 01:18:08.431
Good morning, Culver.

01:18:08.488 --> 01:18:10.468
I'm Daisy Larson
reporting to you live

01:18:10.523 --> 01:18:12.093
from the marina.

01:18:12.158 --> 01:18:13.933
And welcome back to my co-host,

01:18:13.994 --> 01:18:15.564
Jack Gallagher.

01:18:15.629 --> 01:18:18.371
I'm back from my
vacation in Australia.

01:18:18.431 --> 01:18:19.967
And all I have to say

01:18:20.033 --> 01:18:21.478
is things got interesting.

01:18:21.534 --> 01:18:23.605
We're excited
to bring you live coverage

01:18:23.670 --> 01:18:25.149
of a competition challenge

01:18:25.205 --> 01:18:27.913
between local boy,
Billy Bronson,

01:18:27.941 --> 01:18:30.319
and visitor to Culver,
Albie Peterson.

01:18:30.343 --> 01:18:33.381
Oh, it looks like the challenge
is about to begin.

01:18:33.446 --> 01:18:37.588
The challenges are both
physical and intellectual.

01:18:37.651 --> 01:18:39.995
The course is laid out for you.

01:18:40.053 --> 01:18:42.226
If you see
an orange flag like this,

01:18:42.289 --> 01:18:44.462
that is the start of a course.

01:18:44.491 --> 01:18:47.472
There will be
an official at each course.

01:18:47.527 --> 01:18:51.236
There will be
absolutely no cheating.

01:18:52.699 --> 01:18:53.973
The losing team

01:18:54.034 --> 01:18:55.945
will relinquish
all of its findings

01:18:56.002 --> 01:18:57.504
in regards
to the Whittmore treasure

01:18:57.570 --> 01:18:59.049
<i>to the opposing team.</i>

01:18:59.105 --> 01:19:00.243
Are you ready?

01:19:00.307 --> 01:19:03.345
Bring it on!

01:19:03.410 --> 01:19:07.483
Ready, set, go!

01:19:10.383 --> 01:19:12.693
All right, all right.
Row, Row, Row, Row.

01:19:14.587 --> 01:19:16.362
Winnie, calm down!

01:19:16.389 --> 01:19:18.426
You stay on the right.
You stay on the left.

01:19:18.491 --> 01:19:20.528
<i>Hey, Todd! You must like ladies.</i>

01:19:20.593 --> 01:19:22.231
Because you got three of them.

01:19:24.331 --> 01:19:27.437
Winnie! Winnie, sit down!

01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:30.310
Okay, get this girl
away from me.

01:19:30.370 --> 01:19:32.372
<i>Winnie, sit dawn.
You're going to tip the boat.</i>

01:19:32.405 --> 01:19:33.713
Gather away from me!

01:19:33.974 --> 01:19:35.248
We're getting her out of here.

01:19:35.275 --> 01:19:38.688
You!

01:19:38.745 --> 01:19:40.520
I will get you for that!

01:19:43.516 --> 01:19:46.292
Both teams must start
a fire using their supplies.

01:19:46.353 --> 01:19:47.730
The quicker they start it,

01:19:47.988 --> 01:19:49.524
the higher the points received.

01:19:49.556 --> 01:19:51.331
Okay, this is how
we're going to do it.

01:20:03.503 --> 01:20:04.743
<i>Eddie! Try it, try it.</i>

01:20:14.147 --> 01:20:16.423
Hey, um...

01:20:16.449 --> 01:20:17.757
All right, all right.

01:20:18.018 --> 01:20:19.361
Go, go, go.

01:20:19.419 --> 01:20:20.727
Go, go, go, come on.

01:20:22.355 --> 01:20:23.527
I got something.

01:20:23.590 --> 01:20:25.331
It's a big one. Good job, Eddie.

01:20:25.392 --> 01:20:26.564
Come on, Eddie. Come on.

01:20:26.593 --> 01:20:28.038
Get it, get it!

01:20:28.094 --> 01:20:29.300
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

01:20:29.329 --> 01:20:31.309
Aw, seaweed? Really?

01:20:31.364 --> 01:20:33.571
You get the
fish, I'll get the chips.

01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:34.704
You know what I'm saying?

01:20:34.734 --> 01:20:36.042
You know?

01:20:42.642 --> 01:20:44.519
Shh!

01:20:46.046 --> 01:20:47.582
Billy's team is in the lead.

01:20:47.647 --> 01:20:49.752
Do Albie and the Savages
have what it takes

01:20:49.816 --> 01:20:50.816
to get ahead?

01:20:53.386 --> 01:20:54.660
Aw, it's trivia.

01:20:54.721 --> 01:20:57.133
Trivia? Aw, this is the worst.

01:20:57.190 --> 01:20:59.136
This is the worst part
of the competition for me.

01:21:00.326 --> 01:21:01.100
What is it'?

01:21:01.161 --> 01:21:03.402
Oh, trivia. Trivia, I got this.

01:21:03.463 --> 01:21:05.807
A meemall that can flee?

01:21:06.066 --> 01:21:06.737
A mammal.

01:21:06.766 --> 01:21:08.746
Fly.

01:21:14.774 --> 01:21:17.152
Oh, this is a really hard test.

01:21:17.210 --> 01:21:19.690
Next up is an impromptu
talent competition.

01:21:19.746 --> 01:21:23.387
Mr. Riggs, you will be choosing
the winner of this competition?

01:21:23.450 --> 01:21:25.361
Thank you, Daisy.

01:21:25.385 --> 01:21:27.490
It's an honor just to be here.

01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:31.127
If anyone truly

01:21:31.191 --> 01:21:33.364
knows talent,

01:21:33.426 --> 01:21:36.669
especially talent
that you have to

01:21:36.729 --> 01:21:39.733
perform at random,

01:21:39.799 --> 01:21:41.870
without months of
preparation or rehearsal,

01:21:42.135 --> 01:21:43.808
well then, it's me.

01:21:43.870 --> 01:21:46.350
By God's grace, it is me.

01:21:49.342 --> 01:21:50.514
Thanks.

01:21:52.679 --> 01:21:54.522
Talent competition.
We got this in the bag.

01:21:54.581 --> 01:21:55.753
Can I do it'?

01:21:55.815 --> 01:21:58.125
Please? Actually, I
think Tiffany should.

01:21:58.184 --> 01:21:59.686
No, Eddie has got this.

01:21:59.752 --> 01:22:01.459
All right.

01:22:05.592 --> 01:22:07.435
Okay, so let's go.

01:22:07.494 --> 01:22:09.337
No one knows this about me.

01:22:09.395 --> 01:22:12.740
But I am simply
dazzled by mimes.

01:22:12.799 --> 01:22:15.177
Mimes. Yes, mi... mi...

01:22:45.698 --> 01:22:47.177
All right, let's see.

01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:49.180
Okay.

01:22:50.436 --> 01:22:51.915
Oh. Magic.

01:22:52.172 --> 01:22:53.310
Yeah. I love magic.

01:22:56.809 --> 01:22:58.720
An empty hat.

01:22:58.745 --> 01:23:01.385
That's an empty hat. Empty
hat, perfectly empty.

01:23:13.293 --> 01:23:14.931
Okay. Please work.

01:23:19.766 --> 01:23:21.473
A cheeseburger?

01:23:21.501 --> 01:23:23.640
How did he do that'?

01:23:23.703 --> 01:23:25.546
Way to go!

01:23:25.605 --> 01:23:28.950
A cheeseburger!

01:23:29.209 --> 01:23:33.214
Wow, how did he do it'?

01:23:33.279 --> 01:23:33.723
Magic.

01:23:33.780 --> 01:23:36.488
Did somebody see
my cheeseburger?

01:23:36.516 --> 01:23:39.690
I always eat a cheeseburger
when I do the news.

01:23:39.752 --> 01:23:40.890
Let's go, let's go!

01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:42.627
Go, go!

01:23:42.689 --> 01:23:45.761
It's all going to come down
to the scores.

01:23:45.825 --> 01:23:47.361
The Bronsons are in the lead.

01:23:47.393 --> 01:23:48.565
The question is

01:23:48.628 --> 01:23:51.438
can Albie and the Savages
regain some points

01:23:51.497 --> 01:23:52.703
in the next competition?

01:23:52.765 --> 01:23:55.371
The final leg of the competition

01:23:55.435 --> 01:23:57.381
is the Wave Runner race.

01:23:57.437 --> 01:23:59.917
The first person to circle
around the buoy

01:23:59.973 --> 01:24:01.646
and cross the finish line

01:24:01.674 --> 01:24:03.654
wins.

01:24:03.676 --> 01:24:04.984
You got this, Todd.

01:24:07.447 --> 01:24:09.518
I'm going to show you what
a real winner looks like.

01:24:30.503 --> 01:24:32.483
You got this. Come on!

01:24:32.538 --> 01:24:35.280
Whoo! Come on!

01:24:45.318 --> 01:24:46.888
Come on!

01:24:46.953 --> 01:24:49.024
Come on! Oh, he's
almost going to lose.

01:24:49.289 --> 01:24:50.893
He's almost going to lose.

01:24:59.065 --> 01:25:01.477
Yes!

01:25:01.534 --> 01:25:03.411
<i>Go To do'!</i>

01:25:07.407 --> 01:25:08.909
Oh. Good job, Billy.

01:25:12.011 --> 01:25:13.718
All right.

01:25:19.619 --> 01:25:20.893
Hey, he's wet.

01:25:20.953 --> 01:25:22.660
Billy, I'm sorry.

01:25:22.722 --> 01:25:23.996
It's okay.

01:25:24.057 --> 01:25:25.365
I didn't... You know, I just...

01:25:25.425 --> 01:25:26.425
I'm not... It was...

01:25:29.395 --> 01:25:30.465
It was a close one.

01:25:30.530 --> 01:25:31.736
The tallies are in.

01:25:31.798 --> 01:25:33.004
The Mayor has the results.

01:25:33.032 --> 01:25:34.102
Let's see who won.

01:25:35.068 --> 01:25:36.775
And the winner is...

01:25:38.805 --> 01:25:40.079
Please let it be us.

01:25:41.774 --> 01:25:45.517
Billy Bronson.

01:25:45.578 --> 01:25:46.955
<i>We did if!</i>

01:25:47.013 --> 01:25:48.013
<i>We did if!</i>

01:25:50.350 --> 01:25:51.351
I smell something fishy.

01:25:51.417 --> 01:25:52.521
And it's not the lake.

01:25:54.587 --> 01:25:56.032
Going to collect
the winning ticket.

01:25:56.089 --> 01:25:58.091
Dad'? Ha!

01:25:58.358 --> 01:26:01.862
Looks like I'll be taking that
key off your hands after all.

01:26:03.396 --> 01:26:04.670
Not so fast, Mr. Bronson.

01:26:04.731 --> 01:26:05.971
Upon further examination

01:26:06.032 --> 01:26:08.376
into who rightfully
owned the land,

01:26:08.401 --> 01:26:10.677
I came across this
in Mr. Whittmore's will.

01:26:10.737 --> 01:26:12.948
Hold on, Mayor. This treasure
hunt has gone on long enough.

01:26:12.972 --> 01:26:14.610
Come on. End it.

01:26:14.674 --> 01:26:16.085
Well, why would he
announce the winner

01:26:16.109 --> 01:26:17.986
and just, like,
take it back in two seconds?

01:26:18.044 --> 01:26:19.682
In the will, it states

01:26:19.746 --> 01:26:22.659
"if any dispute
between parties exists,"

01:26:22.715 --> 01:26:25.525
"the judgment of who
found the treasure first"

01:26:25.585 --> 01:26:27.792
"should be based
on sportsmanship."

01:26:27.820 --> 01:26:30.027
Okay, what does it...
I'm sporty.

01:26:30.089 --> 01:26:31.466
You guys are sporty, right'?

01:26:31.524 --> 01:26:33.060
Sporty, yeah. Yeah!

01:26:33.126 --> 01:26:34.662
<i>Yeah!</i>

01:26:34.727 --> 01:26:35.727
They're sporty.

01:26:38.131 --> 01:26:42.602
Absolutely no cheating.

01:26:42.668 --> 01:26:45.649
I-I-I don't even know
how that got in there.

01:26:45.705 --> 01:26:46.775
I knew it. I knew it.

01:26:46.839 --> 01:26:48.944
<i>Dude, the official
gave it to us, remember?</i>

01:26:49.008 --> 01:26:51.079
Like halfway through,
we were all confused.

01:26:51.144 --> 01:26:53.522
We were like,
ah, this is difficult.

01:26:53.579 --> 01:26:54.819
<i>And he was like, “Here, man.“</i>

01:26:54.881 --> 01:26:56.087
<i>"“Here's a lighter." Stop.</i>

01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:57.787
And we were like,
"We don't know how."

01:26:57.850 --> 01:26:59.761
And he was like, "I know how."

01:26:59.819 --> 01:27:01.492
So he helped us with everything.

01:27:01.554 --> 01:27:02.726
And then we did it.

01:27:02.789 --> 01:27:03.789
And we're wi...

01:27:05.458 --> 01:27:07.028
But Mayor, cheating
is the American way.

01:27:07.093 --> 01:27:08.834
You watch baseball?

01:27:08.861 --> 01:27:09.862
The good guys win.

01:27:11.564 --> 01:27:12.975
Are we the... Are we the bad...

01:27:12.999 --> 01:27:15.172
Are we the bad guys'?

01:27:15.435 --> 01:27:19.110
Albie and his team are the
true winners. Mayor...

01:27:24.076 --> 01:27:25.487
Mayor, what you talking about'?

01:27:25.545 --> 01:27:27.456
The coordinates, please.

01:27:29.182 --> 01:27:31.025
Give them the coordinates.

01:27:31.083 --> 01:27:32.153
Did you wear sunscreen?

01:27:32.218 --> 01:27:33.993
Dad, do something.

01:27:34.020 --> 01:27:35.795
This kid never wears sunscreen.

01:27:42.895 --> 01:27:44.135
Thank you.

01:27:48.601 --> 01:27:49.705
Wait a minute, no.

01:27:49.769 --> 01:27:51.874
So how do you
decipher it, Albie'?

01:27:51.938 --> 01:27:53.144
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

01:27:53.206 --> 01:27:55.015
I need a map of Culver.

01:27:55.074 --> 01:27:57.020
There you are.

01:27:57.076 --> 01:27:59.147
Good luck. Thank you.

01:27:59.178 --> 01:28:01.158
Dad, fix this.

01:28:01.180 --> 01:28:02.955
You're giving it
to the snot noses.

01:28:03.015 --> 01:28:05.154
Tell me, Mr. Bronson.

01:28:05.218 --> 01:28:07.494
If we were to take a look
in your garage,

01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:09.693
what would we find there
besides your Mustang?

01:28:09.755 --> 01:28:11.166
<i>My wife's pantyhose.</i>

01:28:11.190 --> 01:28:13.830
A weed wanker,
a washing machine.

01:28:13.893 --> 01:28:15.873
I told you it was a stupid idea.

01:28:15.928 --> 01:28:17.908
Basic stuff, power
tools, you know.

01:28:17.930 --> 01:28:19.910
We received an anonymous text.

01:28:19.966 --> 01:28:21.606
Yeah, I don't... I can't
see what that is.

01:28:24.604 --> 01:28:26.845
Sir, you're under arrest
for stealing the town statue.

01:28:26.906 --> 01:28:28.078
They were borrowing it.

01:28:28.140 --> 01:28:30.086
No, we didn't steal...
No, it was my kid.

01:28:30.142 --> 01:28:31.678
No, when he
doesn't wear sunscreen

01:28:31.744 --> 01:28:33.655
he doesn't think so straight.

01:28:33.679 --> 01:28:34.885
Come on. Come on.

01:28:34.947 --> 01:28:39.191
He did it. I did it.

01:28:39.218 --> 01:28:40.959
Well, it looks like
your new boyfriend

01:28:41.020 --> 01:28:42.260
just got arrested.

01:28:42.522 --> 01:28:44.661
I'm definitely changing
my relationship status

01:28:44.724 --> 01:28:46.567
to "It's complicated."

01:28:51.697 --> 01:28:53.973
Roll it out, roll it out. I
want to see where it is.

01:28:57.270 --> 01:28:58.977
According to the coordinates,

01:28:59.038 --> 01:29:00.574
the treasure is hidden at

01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:02.210
the town playground.

01:29:02.275 --> 01:29:04.551
Of course.
I love that twirly slide.

01:29:04.610 --> 01:29:05.987
I love the swings.

01:29:06.045 --> 01:29:07.289
I'm more of a monkey bar
guy myself.

01:29:07.313 --> 01:29:08.690
Let's go.

01:29:15.054 --> 01:29:16.294
Spread out. Search the area.

01:29:19.225 --> 01:29:20.966
Hey, whoa.

01:29:21.027 --> 01:29:22.836
Don't go past the shovels.

01:29:22.895 --> 01:29:26.069
Is it in the grass
or in the mulch?

01:29:26.132 --> 01:29:27.736
Well, he said it was
on the playground,

01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:30.303
so I'm going to trust the genius.
Probably true.

01:29:30.570 --> 01:29:33.016
Boundaries, people.

01:29:33.072 --> 01:29:34.107
Boundaries.

01:29:35.975 --> 01:29:38.922
Where would you
bury the treasure?

01:29:38.978 --> 01:29:39.978
I don't know.

01:29:41.314 --> 01:29:42.816
Eddie, quit playing.

01:29:42.882 --> 01:29:44.002
We got to find the treasure.

01:29:44.050 --> 01:29:46.360
Okay, I'm going
to cast a spell on my hat.

01:29:46.619 --> 01:29:48.897
Wherever it lands, that is where the
treasure is going to be, okay'?

01:29:48.921 --> 01:29:50.127
<i>Go! if.</i>

01:30:00.366 --> 01:30:01.777
There, dig there.

01:30:01.834 --> 01:30:04.314
I think it actually worked.

01:30:04.370 --> 01:30:06.281
Wait, it worked?

01:30:06.339 --> 01:30:07.784
It actually worked?

01:30:09.275 --> 01:30:10.754
I think there's actually
something here.

01:30:10.776 --> 01:30:12.187
Get the shovels. Todd, Todd.

01:30:12.244 --> 01:30:13.951
<i>Todd, shovel.</i>

01:30:14.013 --> 01:30:15.959
Yes, ma'am.

01:30:16.015 --> 01:30:17.756
Here you go, little man.

01:30:23.255 --> 01:30:26.202
I think it's my destiny
to do the news.

01:30:26.258 --> 01:30:28.704
The news chooses us, little man.

01:30:28.761 --> 01:30:31.901
The news chooses us.

01:30:31.964 --> 01:30:33.671
May I'? Sure.

01:30:33.733 --> 01:30:34.803
Thank you.

01:30:35.968 --> 01:30:37.072
Good evening, Culver.

01:30:37.136 --> 01:30:38.945
I'm Vinny Savage reporting live

01:30:39.005 --> 01:30:41.246
from the site where the
Whittmore treasure is hidden.

01:30:41.307 --> 01:30:43.014
Come on.

01:30:43.075 --> 01:30:44.179
<i>Look, there's something.</i>

01:30:44.243 --> 01:30:45.916
How do you feel? Awesome.

01:30:45.945 --> 01:30:49.085
How do you feel? Proud.

01:30:49.148 --> 01:30:50.148
Come on.

01:30:51.751 --> 01:30:54.391
How do you feel? I feel dirty.

01:30:56.188 --> 01:30:57.667
This is kind of a big deal.

01:31:02.094 --> 01:31:03.664
I see something. There it is.

01:31:12.171 --> 01:31:13.946
Here we go.

01:31:22.114 --> 01:31:23.354
What's wrong, Albie'?

01:31:25.851 --> 01:31:27.262
It doesn't feel right.

01:31:27.319 --> 01:31:29.162
Well, what doesn't
feel right, honey?

01:31:29.221 --> 01:31:31.360
Opening it alone.

01:31:31.424 --> 01:31:33.301
Aw. Aw.

01:31:33.359 --> 01:31:35.703
Hey, guys. I'm needed.

01:31:35.728 --> 01:31:36.229
Thank you.

01:31:36.295 --> 01:31:38.434
All right. Ready?

01:31:38.698 --> 01:31:39.698
Come on, Vinny.

01:31:42.735 --> 01:31:43.736
It's a mirror.

01:31:46.272 --> 01:31:48.115
It's just a mirror.

01:31:48.174 --> 01:31:49.744
Wait, lookit.

01:31:49.809 --> 01:31:51.379
"Take a look, for what you see"

01:31:51.410 --> 01:31:53.890
"is truly your greatest
treasure."

01:31:57.183 --> 01:31:59.390
<i>H's us.</i>

01:32:01.387 --> 01:32:02.889
<i>We're the treasure.</i>

01:32:02.955 --> 01:32:04.730
Well, it's a nice box.

01:32:07.359 --> 01:32:09.032
May I see this'?

01:32:09.095 --> 01:32:10.267
Yeah. Thank you.

01:32:12.364 --> 01:32:13.866
Hi.

01:32:16.001 --> 01:32:18.811
My heart is truly warm
with emotion.

01:32:18.871 --> 01:32:20.748
Here I thought
we would find gold

01:32:20.773 --> 01:32:23.014
or diamonds or toys

01:32:23.042 --> 01:32:25.044
or even candy, but...

01:32:25.111 --> 01:32:26.886
the treasure is ourselves.

01:32:26.912 --> 01:32:29.085
How poignant.

01:32:29.148 --> 01:32:31.059
It was an honor
doing the news with you.

01:32:31.117 --> 01:32:32.824
Thank you. Good job, kid.

01:32:32.885 --> 01:32:33.920
Am I fired'?

01:32:33.986 --> 01:32:36.023
Look.

01:32:36.088 --> 01:32:37.362
Guys, guys, look.

01:32:37.423 --> 01:32:38.800
It says, "Look underneath."

01:32:40.192 --> 01:32:41.466
No, wait, that's this, guys.

01:32:41.527 --> 01:32:42.835
Look. Keep digging?

01:32:42.895 --> 01:32:43.965
What'? The lift'?

01:32:44.029 --> 01:32:45.303
Yeah. Pull it.

01:32:49.001 --> 01:32:50.173
That's a treasure.

01:32:50.202 --> 01:32:52.182
Cash money. Cha-ching.

01:32:52.204 --> 01:32:54.548
Wait, there's more.

01:32:54.807 --> 01:32:57.048
It's the deed
to Whittmore's estate.

01:32:57.109 --> 01:32:58.213
We get a mansion?

01:32:58.277 --> 01:32:59.813
Whoa.

01:32:59.879 --> 01:33:03.383
What are you going to do now'?
You're one rich little boy.

01:33:03.449 --> 01:33:05.224
I was already rich.

01:33:07.219 --> 01:33:09.961
Well, I don't know
about you, Culver,

01:33:10.022 --> 01:33:12.366
but I think this kid
is onto something.

01:33:12.424 --> 01:33:15.132
I'm Daisy Larson,
Channel 11 News.

01:33:32.278 --> 01:33:33.484
Hey, you, listen up.

01:33:33.546 --> 01:33:34.854
I will be back in an hour.

01:33:34.914 --> 01:33:36.634
Okay'? I don't want
to be late for the show.

01:33:36.816 --> 01:33:39.296
I wouldn't miss it.
Thanks for bringing me here.

01:33:39.351 --> 01:33:40.591
Yeah. Anytime.

01:33:42.321 --> 01:33:44.494
See you.

01:33:44.557 --> 01:33:46.366
<i>Well, hang on, no.</i>

01:33:46.425 --> 01:33:48.268
<i>You need to move
the boat to the middle</i>

01:33:48.327 --> 01:33:50.367
because otherwise it's going
to be touching his hand

01:33:50.396 --> 01:33:53.309
when he is riding. It's
going to irritate his hand.

01:33:53.365 --> 01:33:55.010
<i>It's going to be scratching
all up on his hand.</i>

01:33:55.034 --> 01:33:57.105
You can't take it off.
It's a present.

01:33:57.136 --> 01:34:00.515
Well, still, he's going
to ride it... He's here.

01:34:00.573 --> 01:34:02.109
<i>Well, hi, hi.</i>

01:34:02.174 --> 01:34:04.313
We figured
you could buy your own,

01:34:04.376 --> 01:34:06.856
but I think she belongs to you.

01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:08.881
Ta-da!

01:34:08.948 --> 01:34:09.948
Wow.

01:34:09.982 --> 01:34:11.859
I've never had a bike before.

01:34:11.884 --> 01:34:13.864
This is great.

01:34:13.886 --> 01:34:14.523
Thanks.

01:34:14.587 --> 01:34:16.999
Is that Old Man Kettle's bike?
Mm-hmm.

01:34:17.022 --> 01:34:18.399
You guys up for a rematch?

01:34:18.424 --> 01:34:19.494
Let's do it.

01:34:19.558 --> 01:34:22.402
But I'm not going easy
on you this time.

01:34:26.932 --> 01:34:28.206
<i>Ley's frail.</i>

01:34:28.267 --> 01:34:30.873
All right, down the hill,

01:34:30.936 --> 01:34:33.576
through the dirt track and
hang a left at the graveyard.

01:34:33.639 --> 01:34:35.585
That's where dead people are.

01:34:37.276 --> 01:34:38.914
First one back wins.

01:34:38.978 --> 01:34:40.286
Graveyard?

01:34:40.312 --> 01:34:44.021
Ready, set, go!

01:36:19.211 --> 01:36:21.191
Recently, a disgruntled
audience member

01:36:21.246 --> 01:36:23.385
tried to check a tomato
at my face.

01:36:23.449 --> 01:36:25.986
And I'm telling you,
I am off carbs.

01:36:26.018 --> 01:36:27.326
I'm only accepting a porterhouse

01:36:27.386 --> 01:36:28.729
or a nice Chéteaubriand.

01:36:31.190 --> 01:36:34.034
So my niece and nephew
are in from the big city.

01:36:34.093 --> 01:36:36.403
And apparently,
my doll collection

01:36:36.428 --> 01:36:38.135
is not cool.

01:36:38.197 --> 01:36:40.677
Yeah, they've officially
declared me

01:36:40.733 --> 01:36:42.406
one of the town elders.

01:36:44.536 --> 01:36:47.142
You know how you give
directions in a small town'?

01:36:47.172 --> 01:36:48.549
Now, this is how
we do it, right'?

01:36:48.574 --> 01:36:51.077
We don't say, "Get on the 405 S."

01:36:51.143 --> 01:36:52.645
"Take the 10 E." No, no.

01:36:52.711 --> 01:36:55.191
Too many numbers.
Too complicated.

01:36:55.247 --> 01:36:58.694
We say, "You're going to go past
the cornfield on your left."

01:36:58.751 --> 01:37:00.697
"And when you get to the
end of that cornfield,"

01:37:00.719 --> 01:37:03.427
"there's going to be some cows
agrazing on your right."

01:37:03.489 --> 01:37:05.526
<i>“And there's a fork in the road.</i>

01:37:05.591 --> 01:37:08.031
"Don't go to the left. Don't go
to the left. Go to the right."

01:37:08.060 --> 01:37:10.062
"You go in the lake,
you've gone too far."

01:37:11.663 --> 01:37:14.166
So, you guys,
you know it's a small town

01:37:14.233 --> 01:37:17.373
when on Halloween, you just
need one bag of candy.

01:37:17.436 --> 01:37:21.441
And you have the luxury of eating
half of it yourself.

01:37:21.473 --> 01:37:24.386
<i>Thank you, thank you.</i>
