07:45.548 --> 07:48.968
We finally agreed that I would
forego the death penalty,

07:53.723 --> 07:55.558
<i>He would go down to California,</i>

07:55.641 --> 07:57.435
<i>and he could do his prison time there</i>

07:57.518 --> 07:59.103
and that's what he wanted to do

07:59.187 --> 08:01.189

mental health treatment.

08:02.064 --> 08:05.359

<i>Please welcome Rodney Alcala.</i>
<i>Rod, welcome.</i>

10:52.485 --> 10:55.196

10:57.907 --> 11:00.201
He thought that he was extremely handsome

11:02.912 --> 11:05.831
PATTIN: <i>In fact, one of</i>

is you're witnessing
the unbridled narcissistic arrogance

11:21.555 --> 11:23.391
of a lot of serial killers.

11:23.474 --> 11:26.060
<i>They believe they're better looking,</i>
<i>more charming</i>

11:26.143 --> 11:29.730
and going on <i>The Dating Game</i>
is all eyes on me,

11:29.814 --> 11:31.273
<i>I am the great Rodney Alcala.</i>

11:31.357 --> 11:33.401
Look at how charming and funny I can be,

11:33.484 --> 11:36.445
I'm killing everybody,
and I'm still gonna win this date.

11:36.529 --> 11:39.407
<i>What's your best time?</i>

11:40.324 --> 11:43.327
<i>The best time is at night, night time.</i>

11:44.412 --> 11:45.996
SATRIANO: <i>It's so disturbing</i>

11:46.080 --> 11:48.416
and so frightening because you can imagine

11:48.499 --> 11:51.210
that that's the person these victims saw

11:51.293 --> 11:54.088
as he showed them that he was in control

11:54.171 --> 11:56.882
as he subdued them, as he violated them.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.384
Uh, that's what they saw.

11:58.467 --> 12:01.137
That's the monster
they saw in front of them

12:01.220 --> 12:02.471
before he took their lives.

12:03.431 --> 12:07.476
In the end, the host asks
so, who will it be?

12:07.560 --> 12:08.686
<i>Bachelor number one...</i>

12:08.769 --> 12:10.146
JIM LANGE: <i>Bachelor number two</i>

12:10.229 --> 12:11.230
<i>or bachelor number three?</i>

12:11.313 --> 12:12.231
<i>I'll take one.</i>

12:12.898 --> 12:15.526
LANGE: <i>Number one!</i>
<i>Bachelor number one. Alright.</i>

12:15.609 --> 12:17.111
(audience cheering, applauding)

12:17.194 --> 12:19.196
She seemed very excited about seeing him.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.198
And when he came around,

12:21.282 --> 12:25.453
<i>I would say it was a pretty, um,</i>
<i>lukewarm togetherness.</i>

12:25.536 --> 12:28.539
Cheryl Bradshaw called
the casting director the next day

12:28.622 --> 12:30.833
and said, I have
a very bad feeling about him.

12:30.916 --> 12:33.043
She said, "Ellen, I can't, um--

12:33.127 --> 12:34.545
"I can't go out with this guy.

12:34.628 --> 12:36.881
"He's-- there's weird vibes
that are coming off of him.

12:36.964 --> 12:40.050
"He--he's very strange.
I'm not comfortable.

12:40.134 --> 12:42.678
Is that gonna be a problem?"
And of course, I said no.

12:43.012 --> 12:45.639
Thank goodness that,
that Cheryl Bradshaw had

12:46.390 --> 12:49.727
gut instincts to stay away from this guy.

12:49.810 --> 12:52.480
There is no doubt in my mind
that had he gone on this date,

12:52.980 --> 12:55.357
uh, that contestant
would have come up missing.

12:56.066 --> 12:59.195
I can't imagine that the fact
that they were on TV

12:59.278 --> 13:03.240
would've made him hesitate
for one second to murder her.

13:04.992 --> 13:07.286
It might have been his
crowning achievement in his own mind.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.166
Through the course of the investigation,

13:12.249 --> 13:16.128
detectives contacted the studio
and got a copy of the tape.

13:16.212 --> 13:19.882
They showed that tape
to Robin's friend Bridget,

13:19.965 --> 13:23.803
<i>and she identified</i>
<i>Rodney Alcala on the videotape</i>

13:24.094 --> 13:26.055
<i>as being the person that approached them</i>
<i>on the beach</i>

13:26.430 --> 13:27.807
<i>to take their photographs.</i>

13:27.890 --> 13:30.976
They focused hard on him
and began doing surveillances

13:31.060 --> 13:34.396
on his mother's house, uh,
where he was staying at the time.

13:35.397 --> 13:37.983
MURPHY: <i>He was driving around</i>
<i>this creepy station wagon,</i>

13:38.067 --> 13:40.694
<i>and every instinct of these detectives</i>
<i>was telling them</i>

13:40.778 --> 13:42.071
<i>"This is our guy."</i>

13:43.781 --> 13:46.200
<i>And then in Altadena, California,</i>

13:46.283 --> 13:48.285
<i>there's a fire crew working a hillside</i>

13:49.620 --> 13:51.330
and, uh, they found a human skull

14:00.756 --> 14:04.218
PATTIN: <i>Nearly two weeks</i>
<i>after Robin went missing,</i>

14:04.343 --> 14:06.720
a forestry service worker

14:06.804 --> 14:10.599
<i>is up in the mountains in the LA area</i>

14:10.683 --> 14:13.102
and finds some remains.

14:15.479 --> 14:18.107
MACK: <i>There was evidence</i>
<i>that there was animal activity.</i>

14:18.190 --> 14:19.733
Bones were disarticulated.

14:19.817 --> 14:23.195
<i>Uh, skull was found separate</i>
<i>from the rest of the bones.</i>

14:23.279 --> 14:27.867
<i>They found a mass</i>
<i>of human hair, blonde in color.</i>

14:27.950 --> 14:31.328
They also found a tennis shoe
and a beach towel.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.205
<i>Due to the condition of the body</i>

14:33.289 --> 14:35.958
and the fact that it had been two weeks
and the animal activity,

14:36.041 --> 14:39.420
it was difficult to get her
positively identified.

14:40.087 --> 14:42.923
PATTIN: <i>Detectives had to do</i>
<i>a dental records match.</i>

14:43.549 --> 14:47.636
They determined that
it was indeed Robin Samsoe.

14:50.264 --> 14:52.391
I remember I was laying on the couch

14:53.934 --> 14:55.394
and the doorbell rang

14:57.688 --> 14:59.607
and I answered the door

15:00.441 --> 15:02.276
and it was the police.

15:03.944 --> 15:07.865
They came in... and they told us

15:07.948 --> 15:09.533
that they had found Robin.

15:13.370 --> 15:17.124
<i>And my mom broke down</i>
<i>as well as everybody else,</i>

15:17.207 --> 15:18.334
<i>my brothers and I.</i>

15:18.834 --> 15:19.752
(smacks lips)

15:20.794 --> 15:22.046
It was devastating.

15:24.089 --> 15:27.092
<i>My mom just, she was never the same.</i>

15:27.593 --> 15:32.973
It's like her... life just had
this big empty hole,

15:33.057 --> 15:38.062
and everybody else was just
on the outside looking in.

15:43.275 --> 15:45.819
MURPHY: <i>Finding Robin's remains means</i>

15:45.903 --> 15:47.237
<i>it was now a murder case.</i>

15:48.447 --> 15:50.366
Now we know that we've got somebody
that has actually

15:50.449 --> 15:53.410
not just kidnapped a 12-year-old
but murdered a 12-year-old.

15:55.245 --> 15:57.581
<i>But when it comes to the case</i>
<i>at this point,</i>

15:57.665 --> 15:58.832
<i>what do detectives have?</i>

15:58.916 --> 16:00.668
<i>They had minimal evidence against him.</i>

16:02.670 --> 16:04.838
SATRIANO: <i>On July 24th, 1979,</i>

16:04.922 --> 16:07.925
<i>law enforcement finally gets</i>
<i>to go arrest Rodney Alcala.</i>

16:08.384 --> 16:10.719
<i>They are armed with an arrest warrant</i>
<i>and a search warrant,</i>

16:10.803 --> 16:14.181
and they go to his mother's home
where he lived at the time.

16:14.264 --> 16:16.517
They find Rodney Alcala in bed.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.644
They handcuff him, and they take him away.

16:21.855 --> 16:23.440
MACK: <i>During the search</i>
<i>of his premises,</i>

16:23.524 --> 16:25.275
a sergeant standing in the living room

16:25.359 --> 16:28.153
of his mother's house
looked down on a coffee table,

16:30.364 --> 16:32.741
<i>and there was a receipt</i>
<i>for a storage facility</i>

16:32.825 --> 16:35.369
<i>out of King County in Washington.</i>

16:36.036 --> 16:38.956
SATRIANO: <i>Even though the search warrant</i>
<i>didn't list that piece of paper</i>

16:39.039 --> 16:40.708
and he couldn't collect that as evidence,

16:40.791 --> 16:43.794
he was smart enough
to notate the information

16:43.877 --> 16:46.171
of that receipt in his notepad.

16:49.299 --> 16:53.220
The police wondered why this person
that lived in the LA area

16:53.303 --> 16:55.931
would have a storage locker
in the state of Washington.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.185
MACK: <i>The date for the storage unit rental</i>

17:00.269 --> 17:01.603
<i>was July 11th,</i>

17:01.687 --> 17:03.814
<i>which is after Robin's disappearance</i>

17:05.065 --> 17:07.484
and nine days
after her body was discovered.

17:12.906 --> 17:14.283
<i>When the case went to court,</i>

17:14.366 --> 17:17.536
Rodney Alcala pleaded not guilty
to the crime.

17:23.459 --> 17:25.669
PATTIN: <i>After Rodney Alcala</i>
<i>has been processed</i>

17:25.753 --> 17:28.922
<i>and he's sitting in jail,</i>
<i>he gets a visit from his sister.</i>

17:29.214 --> 17:32.885
And they're chatting,
and Rodney Alcala says

17:33.969 --> 17:38.307
<i>that thank god they don't know</i>
<i>about the storage locker in Seattle.</i>

17:39.683 --> 17:41.643
<i>Well, little did he know</i>

17:42.394 --> 17:44.271
<i>that conversation was being recorded.</i>

17:46.273 --> 17:49.651
SATRIANO: <i>Police knew that this was an</i>
<i>important place for them to go.</i>

17:50.194 --> 17:53.739
They needed to go up to Seattle
and search that storage locker

17:53.822 --> 17:56.700
and see what Rodney Alcala
did not want them to see.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.666
MURPHY: <i>The next day,</i>
<i>officers were in Seattle</i>

18:04.750 --> 18:06.168
<i>with a search warrant in hand.</i>

18:08.212 --> 18:10.589
<i>The question is what would detectives find</i>

18:10.672 --> 18:12.132
<i>inside that storage locker?</i>

18:12.216 --> 18:15.219
What did Rodney Alcala
leave in there that might help the case?

18:16.512 --> 18:19.014
PATTIN: <i>They go into his</i>
<i>storage locker,</i>

18:19.098 --> 18:22.518
and they came across
well, a treasure trove.

18:24.978 --> 18:27.397
They find thousands of photographs

18:27.481 --> 18:31.276
of women, of children
in all different poses.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.779
<i>Some in clothes, some not in clothes.</i>

18:34.363 --> 18:37.116
Some were pictures of him

18:37.199 --> 18:40.327
involved in sexual situations with women.

18:41.745 --> 18:44.456
<i>Unknown if they had knowledge</i>
<i>he was taking photographs.</i>

18:44.540 --> 18:48.627
He was using a long remote cord
to take these photographs.

18:48.710 --> 18:51.421
<i>But no photographs</i>
<i>of Robin Samsoe were found.</i>

18:53.715 --> 18:56.301
MURPHY: <i>We later released</i>
<i>these photos to the public</i>

18:56.385 --> 18:58.637
in an effort to identify all the people in
these pictures,

18:58.720 --> 19:02.850
<i>and we got very few responses back.</i>

19:03.642 --> 19:07.271
In addition, they find
a small red jewelry pouch

19:07.354 --> 19:09.106
<i>of a woman's jewelry</i>

19:09.189 --> 19:12.484
<i>including various charms and earrings.</i>

19:12.943 --> 19:17.072
I remember them asking my mom
to the police department

19:17.156 --> 19:20.117
<i>to come and identify some</i>
<i>things that they found at a locker,</i>

19:21.034 --> 19:22.828
and there were a pair of earrings.

19:24.580 --> 19:26.832
SATRIANO:
<i>She recognizes those gold ball earrings</i>

19:27.249 --> 19:30.043
<i>as her earrings</i>
<i>that her daughter was wearing</i>

19:30.127 --> 19:33.130
when she disappeared
after being at the beach.

19:35.674 --> 19:37.926
JAMES ALAN FOX: <i>Serial killers</i>
<i>are not ashamed of what they've done</i>

19:38.010 --> 19:42.514
so oftentimes they will
keep records, written records.

19:42.598 --> 19:44.600
Sometimes keep souvenirs.

19:45.184 --> 19:48.270
SATRIANO:
<i>Their thought is that jewelry pouch</i>

19:48.353 --> 19:51.648
<i>ends up being jewelry</i>
<i>he collected off his victims</i>

19:51.732 --> 19:54.318
and kept as trophies of those murders.

19:54.401 --> 19:56.278
There must be other victims out there.

19:59.323 --> 20:01.200
MURPHY: <i>So at this point,</i>
<i>detectives are very confident</i>

20:01.283 --> 20:03.160
<i>they have all the evidence</i>
<i>they need to establish</i>

20:03.243 --> 20:06.163
that Rodney Alcala was
the murderer of Robin Samsoe.

20:06.955 --> 20:10.083
He was charged
with kidnapping and homicide.

20:11.210 --> 20:14.171
MURPHY: <i>During the trial,</i>
<i>Rodney Alcala behaved</i>

20:14.254 --> 20:16.298
<i>with all the arrogance and cocksurety</i>

20:16.381 --> 20:18.258
that Rodney Alcala always behaved with.

20:21.511 --> 20:23.805
MACK: <i>One day during the trial,</i>
<i>Robin's mother walked</i>

20:23.889 --> 20:26.183
<i>into the courtroom</i>
<i>with a gun in her purse.</i>

20:26.642 --> 20:28.268
And she made up her mind
that she was going

20:28.352 --> 20:30.020
to shoot him in court that day.

20:30.103 --> 20:32.856
<i>He was blowing kisses</i>
<i>at me across the courtroom.</i>

20:32.940 --> 20:34.733
<i>I thought I was gonna lose my mind.</i>

20:35.275 --> 20:37.611
<i>And I thought I was</i>
<i>gonna go crazy, you know.</i>

20:38.195 --> 20:42.407
<i>And I reached in my purse</i>
<i>and I was gonna grab it and, uh--</i>

20:44.952 --> 20:47.579
She said at the time that she reached

20:47.663 --> 20:49.081
into her purse for the gun

20:49.748 --> 20:52.459
and she could actually feel
Robin's hand on hers,

20:53.252 --> 20:55.712
like, telling her not to do it,
so she didn't do it.

20:56.838 --> 20:58.173
MURPHY: <i>The trial was held,</i>

20:58.340 --> 21:02.010
<i>witnesses testified, and the</i>
<i>jury found Rodney Alcala guilty</i>

21:02.094 --> 21:04.179
<i>and ultimately sentenced him to death.</i>

21:04.263 --> 21:08.892
That brought a sense of justice
to Robin Samsoe's family,

21:08.976 --> 21:12.938
um, but unfortunately
that would be very short lived.

21:18.777 --> 21:21.238
LOUISE FARR: <i>It was an extraordinary time</i>
<i>in Los Angeles.</i>

21:21.321 --> 21:23.115
There were so many serial killings

21:23.198 --> 21:25.534
that the LAPD could barely keep up.

21:27.035 --> 21:28.787
DAVE LOPEZ: <i>We would go into the newsroom,</i>

21:28.870 --> 21:32.332
<i>and we would always say,</i>
<i>"My God, please, not another one."</i>

21:32.833 --> 21:34.418
Then came a story

21:34.501 --> 21:36.169
that just absolutely floored me.

21:48.682 --> 21:52.686
(metal grinding)

21:54.604 --> 21:57.816
♪♪

21:57.899 --> 22:01.236

22:01.320 --> 22:04.740

22:08.994 --> 22:14.041

22:14.124 --> 22:17.127
I can remember the very first time
we heard the story

22:17.210 --> 22:19.212
about a body being found
on the side of the road.

22:19.296 --> 22:22.257
We didn't know much about it,
and then you get a second one

22:22.341 --> 22:25.635
<i>and then you got a third one</i>
<i>and then you got a fourth one.</i>

22:26.011 --> 22:28.388
And then you started saying,
"Okay, wha-what's going on here?"

22:29.765 --> 22:33.101
RENNER: <i>The victims were found</i>
<i>on or near the freeway.</i>

22:33.185 --> 22:36.563
They were strangled,
ligature strangulation,

22:36.646 --> 22:39.649
and they had definitely been
sexually assaulted.

22:41.610 --> 22:44.905
MORRISON: <i>All of us use freeways,</i>
<i>all of us know freeways.</i>

22:44.988 --> 22:47.741
It's a point of connection for
all of Southern Californians,

22:47.824 --> 22:49.117
<i>whether you like them or not.</i>

22:49.201 --> 22:50.660
MICHAEL CONNELLY:
<i>There's no existence here</i>

22:50.744 --> 22:52.204
<i>that does not include freeways</i>

22:52.621 --> 22:55.832
so you're obviously striking into the life

22:55.916 --> 22:58.502
and imagination of everybody in the city.

22:58.585 --> 23:00.837
That's one reason why that case

23:01.838 --> 23:03.924
<i>gripped everyone in a big way.</i>

23:06.051 --> 23:07.386
HOLES: <i>A consistent characteristic</i>

23:07.469 --> 23:09.304
<i>was showing up with all these victims.</i>

23:09.388 --> 23:10.847
<i>They were all young males.</i>

23:11.264 --> 23:14.851
<i>Well, this is different than</i>
<i>the Hillside Strangler Case.</i>

23:15.227 --> 23:18.397
Back in the 1970s,
this is the type of crime

23:18.480 --> 23:20.565
that you would almost exclusively see

23:20.649 --> 23:22.401
happening to women or females.

23:22.484 --> 23:26.905
But here you have males
that are being attacked sexually,

23:26.988 --> 23:30.075
being killed, and then
their bodies are being dumped.

23:30.158 --> 23:32.077
So this was unusual.

23:32.619 --> 23:35.580

ROBERT SOUZA:
<i>You know, there is an old adage</i>

23:51.763 --> 23:53.056
<i>with the police department.</i>

23:53.390 --> 23:54.766
<i>You have to be a good street cop</i>

23:54.850 --> 23:56.435
<i>before you can be a decent detective.</i>

23:57.018 --> 23:58.603
My education came from the street.

24:00.105 --> 24:02.691
<i>I knew and I understood thieves.</i>

24:02.774 --> 24:05.735
I knew and understood drugs and addicts,

24:05.819 --> 24:09.990
and... I could spot a bad guy
at a hundred yards.

24:12.325 --> 24:14.411
<i>At the time, my partner was</i>
<i>number one detective</i>

24:14.494 --> 24:16.371
<i>on the department, John St. John.</i>

24:17.414 --> 24:19.249
John St. John was pretty much a legend

24:19.332 --> 24:20.667
on the police department.

24:20.750 --> 24:23.795
<i>He had actually worked</i>
<i>on the Black Dahlia case</i>

24:23.920 --> 24:25.297
<i>in the '40s.</i>

24:25.630 --> 24:26.923
<i>We called him Jigsaw John.</i>

24:27.466 --> 24:30.760
<i>They had done a TV series about his life,</i>

24:30.844 --> 24:32.179
<i>and they were fascinated with the fact</i>

24:32.262 --> 24:35.348
<i>that he said that putting</i>
<i>a murder case together</i>

24:35.432 --> 24:37.601
<i>is like working a jigsaw puzzle.</i>

24:38.810 --> 24:42.314
For about two years, we handled
various cases involving homicide.

24:44.191 --> 24:46.902
<i>And then The Freeway Killer case starts,</i>

24:47.986 --> 24:50.405
<i>and that really changed</i>
<i>just about everything.</i>

24:51.740 --> 24:52.949
HOLES: <i>Bodies kept showing up</i>

24:53.033 --> 24:55.285
<i>all over Southern California.</i>

24:55.368 --> 24:57.746
This is a huge geographic spread.

24:59.289 --> 25:00.582
SOUZA:
<i>Police departments hate patterns</i>

25:00.665 --> 25:03.126
because serial killers create
a lot of press.

25:03.210 --> 25:05.587
<i>So, it was played down</i>
<i>quite a bit to begin with.</i>

25:07.714 --> 25:09.132
LOPEZ: <i>They would have just spoon fed us,</i>

25:09.216 --> 25:10.842
<i>and we would have, you know,</i>
<i>thank you very much,</i>

25:10.926 --> 25:12.010
<i>okay, here's your news release.</i>

25:12.093 --> 25:13.762
Now go home and report that.

25:13.845 --> 25:15.013
Do this, don't deviate.

25:15.096 --> 25:16.556
No, no, we weren't gonna do that.

25:16.640 --> 25:19.351
<i>We--we knew. I mean, we-- you know,</i>
<i>we started finding out</i>

25:19.434 --> 25:21.561
<i>who these people were, the victims.</i>

25:23.104 --> 25:24.773
You saw that some of these victims

25:24.856 --> 25:27.609
were people who were hitchhiking
who wanted a ride,

25:28.026 --> 25:31.321
<i>who relied on some generous driver</i>
<i>to pick them up.</i>

25:31.404 --> 25:34.491
<i>Hitchhiking was</i>
<i>a pretty ordinary thing to do,</i>

25:34.574 --> 25:37.953
and it was very much part
of the American culture.

25:39.538 --> 25:41.623
HOLES: <i>Here you have an offender</i>
<i>that is moving around.</i>

25:41.706 --> 25:44.125
<i>He's able to abduct victims,</i>
<i>he is attacking them,</i>

25:44.209 --> 25:46.002
<i>and then he is going all over the place</i>

25:46.086 --> 25:48.255
<i>to dump them off the side of the road.</i>

25:48.338 --> 25:51.466
And these detectives are trying
to figure out what's going on.

25:51.925 --> 25:53.843
LOPEZ: <i>More bodies kept piling up.</i>

25:54.219 --> 25:55.595
This was a tough one to crack.

25:56.930 --> 25:58.515
SOUZA: <i>How many killers</i>
<i>did we have out there?</i>

25:58.598 --> 26:01.434
We just, we just didn't know.
It was all a big puzzle.

26:07.274 --> 26:09.317
<i>I was no stranger to homicide.</i>

26:09.901 --> 26:12.070
<i>We had seen many different</i>
<i>types of murders</i>

26:12.612 --> 26:15.699
<i>but never a continuity of this torture</i>

26:15.782 --> 26:18.952
<i>and brutalizing and, uh, and mutilating.</i>

26:19.035 --> 26:24.624
<i>We... we'd never seen that</i>
<i>as an ongoing serial killer.</i>

26:27.919 --> 26:29.671
<i>It does change your life,</i>

26:29.754 --> 26:31.715
<i>you internalize a certain amount of it,</i>

26:31.798 --> 26:34.467
and you just have to keep moving forward

26:35.176 --> 26:38.513
and doing everything you can
to find the person who did it.

26:43.393 --> 26:46.062
<i>It was February of 1980,</i>
<i>we were in the office,</i>

26:46.146 --> 26:48.898
<i>and we got a call from Central Detectives</i>

26:48.982 --> 26:51.651
<i>that they had found a body</i>
<i>in a dumpster in an alley</i>

26:51.735 --> 26:54.112
off of Second and Main
Downtown Los Angeles.

26:57.073 --> 26:59.367
<i>There was a full dumpster here.</i>

27:01.911 --> 27:06.958
<i>So, I looked in and I saw</i>
<i>the nude body of a young boy,</i>

27:09.336 --> 27:11.171
<i>14 to 16 years old.</i>

27:17.761 --> 27:19.220
<i>The way the body was laying,</i>

27:19.346 --> 27:21.806
<i>we were reasonably certain</i>
<i>that he wasn't killed there.</i>

27:21.890 --> 27:24.517
<i>He was tossed in there. He wasn't staged.</i>

27:24.601 --> 27:26.061
<i>But I didn't see any indication</i>

27:26.144 --> 27:27.562
<i>that they tried to hide the body.</i>

27:27.646 --> 27:29.856
<i>I think it was just let's get rid of it.</i>

27:30.231 --> 27:32.692
I noticed that there might have been
some ligature marks on his neck,

27:32.776 --> 27:34.819
but it was difficult to see
because there was a lot of debris

27:34.903 --> 27:36.112
in with the body.

27:36.237 --> 27:37.781
<i>We weren't sure</i>
<i>if he was sexually assaulted</i>

27:37.864 --> 27:39.741
<i>but being nude, we thought that was,</i>

27:39.824 --> 27:40.992
<i>that was very possible.</i>

27:41.701 --> 27:43.244
We figured that the victim weighed

27:43.328 --> 27:46.373
probably somewhere around 160,
170 pounds maybe.

27:46.456 --> 27:47.999
It would be difficult for one man

27:48.083 --> 27:49.751
to pick the body up
and put it in the dumpster.

27:50.418 --> 27:53.880
<i>I'm six-four and for me</i>
<i>I'm kind of straining</i>

27:53.963 --> 27:55.131
<i>to look in the dumpsters,</i>

27:55.215 --> 27:57.050
<i>so someone had to lift it fairly high.</i>

27:57.592 --> 27:59.177
So, we at that point, we started thinking

27:59.260 --> 28:02.347
that if this is a serial killer,
he has an accomplice.

28:04.432 --> 28:06.601
<i>We identified him as Charles Miranda.</i>

28:06.685 --> 28:07.894
<i>He was 15 years old.</i>

28:08.645 --> 28:12.732
At the time, my oldest son was 15,
and I had to stand the autopsy.

28:13.900 --> 28:15.276
<i>And that was a rough autopsy</i>

28:15.360 --> 28:18.029
<i>because all I could think about</i>
<i>was my own son.</i>

28:20.198 --> 28:21.991
<i>Once we left the autopsy,</i>

28:22.075 --> 28:24.536
it didn't take us long
to figure out that our victim

28:24.619 --> 28:26.830
<i>was probably connected to the other cases</i>

28:26.913 --> 28:29.749
<i>because it had all of the</i>
<i>earmarks of those cases.</i>

28:29.833 --> 28:33.211
But we had never seen anything
this wide of a scope.

28:34.421 --> 28:37.173
<i>This amount of area</i>
<i>from the beach to the desert.</i>

28:38.216 --> 28:40.301
<i>It was pretty amazing to us that one man,</i>

28:40.385 --> 28:42.512
and maybe even an accomplice,
could carry this out

28:42.595 --> 28:44.180
and--and--and nobody saw anything.

28:47.225 --> 28:50.186
So with the Freeway Killer
on the loose in Southern California,

28:51.813 --> 28:54.107
<i>the police meanwhile are closing in</i>

28:54.190 --> 28:55.734
<i>on the Hillside Strangler case.</i>

28:57.402 --> 29:00.321
<i>Now the complaint alleges</i>
<i>that Bianchi is believed</i>

29:00.405 --> 29:02.782
<i>to have committed the crimes</i>
<i>with another person.</i>

29:03.366 --> 29:06.453
<i>Insufficient evidence exists</i>
<i>right now to charge anyone</i>

29:06.536 --> 29:08.246
<i>other than Mr. Bianchi.</i>

29:11.958 --> 29:13.585
GROGAN: <i>We knew we were in trouble.</i>

29:13.960 --> 29:16.337
<i>The only thing that we had on Angelo Buono</i>

29:16.421 --> 29:18.590
<i>was Kenny Bianchi testifying.</i>

29:18.673 --> 29:23.511
We knew that we had
a professional pathological liar

29:23.595 --> 29:24.471
as a witness

29:24.971 --> 29:27.348
<i>who was gonna testify against his cousin.</i>

29:28.600 --> 29:30.435
<i>Bianchi would not come off</i>

29:30.518 --> 29:33.396
<i>as a very strong witness</i>
<i>for the prosecution.</i>

29:33.813 --> 29:37.150
So, we knew that whatever we had to do,

29:37.233 --> 29:41.571
<i>we had to strengthen</i>
<i>and corroborate his credibility</i>

29:41.654 --> 29:45.158
<i>by actually supporting</i>
<i>things that he said.</i>

29:52.832 --> 29:55.418
<i>The first time I started interviewing him,</i>

29:55.502 --> 29:58.713
<i>he started to tell me how he was so happy</i>

29:58.797 --> 30:02.175
<i>that he would be able to work</i>
<i>with me and solve this crime.</i>

30:02.258 --> 30:04.260
<i>And that the fact was I always wanted</i>

30:04.344 --> 30:06.137
<i>to be a police officer, you know.</i>

30:07.764 --> 30:09.474
<i>And I just blow my stack.</i>

30:11.434 --> 30:13.645
<i>I just said "Sit down and shut up</i>

30:13.728 --> 30:15.355
<i>"and you answer the questions.</i>

30:15.438 --> 30:17.315
<i>"That's your only responsibility.</i>

30:17.398 --> 30:18.983
<i>I don't want any more crap from you."</i>

30:22.779 --> 30:24.072
<i>I knew better than that.</i>

30:24.155 --> 30:27.325
<i>You know, I've already had</i>
<i>this guy pegged solid.</i>

30:27.408 --> 30:28.701
There is nowhere he can go,

30:28.785 --> 30:30.286
and I ain't gonna let him go anywhere.

30:30.370 --> 30:31.496
I nearly didn't.

30:31.579 --> 30:33.289
I pressured him so hard

30:33.373 --> 30:35.959
<i>particularly with Kristina Weckler.</i>

30:36.709 --> 30:38.336
He says we were having

30:38.419 --> 30:40.380
a difficult time trying to kill her.

30:41.256 --> 30:42.882
<i>She just wouldn't die.</i>

30:42.966 --> 30:46.052
So, they thought that they would
inject her with Windex.

30:48.596 --> 30:50.515
Those were the needle marks
I saw on her body

30:50.598 --> 30:52.183
when I first saw her body.

30:55.687 --> 30:58.690
<i>At that moment, I would have lost no sleep</i>

30:58.773 --> 31:00.441
<i>putting a bullet in his head.</i>

31:00.900 --> 31:02.861
But, uh, I'm a professional

31:03.820 --> 31:05.488
and I can't do that.

31:05.947 --> 31:08.366
<i>Strangle 'em all.</i>
<i>It's the easiest way to go.</i>

31:08.449 --> 31:09.534
PSYCHIATRIST: <i>With what?</i>

31:09.617 --> 31:10.660
<i>Cords.</i>

31:10.743 --> 31:12.203
<i>Would you bring it with you?</i>

31:12.287 --> 31:14.330
<i>Bags. You bet.</i>

31:14.414 --> 31:15.748
<i>What do you mean bags?</i>

31:15.832 --> 31:19.002
<i>Bags. What you do is</i>
<i>you take cellophane bags,</i>

31:19.085 --> 31:21.004
<i>and you just twist them up real tight.</i>

31:22.005 --> 31:23.047
<i>There's nothing to it.</i>

31:23.506 --> 31:25.800
BOREN: <i>Bianchi gave the MO</i>

31:26.009 --> 31:28.595
<i>as to all of the murders essentially this.</i>

31:29.429 --> 31:31.347
The victims were usually in handcuffs

31:31.431 --> 31:33.141
when they arrived at Buono's house.

31:33.641 --> 31:35.476
They were taken inside the house

31:35.560 --> 31:37.186
<i>and brought to the leather chair.</i>

31:38.354 --> 31:39.772
<i>And we called it the murder chair.</i>

31:41.274 --> 31:42.567
According to Bianchi,

31:42.692 --> 31:46.070
every victim who came
in that house sat in that chair.

31:48.990 --> 31:51.826
<i>And from that chair on</i>
<i>started the procedure.</i>

PSYCHIATRIST: <i>Where did you kill her?</i>

32:05.965 --> 32:07.550
<i>Right at Angelo's house.</i>

32:08.259 --> 32:10.470
They had the victims strip
or they stripped the victims.

32:10.553 --> 32:13.014
Sometimes they cut off the clothing.

32:13.514 --> 32:18.102
<i>They blindfolded the victims</i>
<i>using material from Buono's shop</i>

32:18.186 --> 32:19.646
<i>and masking tape,</i>

32:19.729 --> 32:22.482
<i>and they put a shop rag</i>
<i>in the girl's mouth</i>

32:22.565 --> 32:24.859
<i>and then put tape around their head.</i>

32:24.943 --> 32:26.819
<i>So, they're blindfolded and gagged.</i>

32:27.153 --> 32:28.988
And then they'd take them
into the spare bedroom

32:29.405 --> 32:31.658
<i>and rape them and kill them.</i>

32:34.160 --> 32:35.495
MURPHY: <i>So police already know</i>

32:35.578 --> 32:37.872
<i>how Bianchi and Buono</i>
<i>were killing their victims</i>

32:37.956 --> 32:39.958
but with the information
supplied by Bianchi,

32:40.041 --> 32:41.417
they now have everything they need

32:41.501 --> 32:43.670
<i>to actually arrest Angelo Buono.</i>

32:44.045 --> 32:45.421
(police sirens)

32:46.130 --> 32:47.590
LOPEZ: <i>The cops just swarmed at that shop</i>

32:47.674 --> 32:49.759
<i>and they brought him out handcuffed,</i>

32:49.842 --> 32:51.636
and that I can remember very vividly

32:53.471 --> 32:55.306
GROGAN: <i>I could hardly wait</i>
<i>to go back and arrest</i>

32:55.390 --> 32:57.266
<i>that son of a bitch, I really wanted to.</i>

32:57.350 --> 33:00.687
<i>And, uh, I remember what I told him</i>
<i>when I left the first time,</i>

33:00.770 --> 33:02.397
<i>I said the next time I'm coming back here</i>

33:02.480 --> 33:03.648
<i>I'm gonna arrest you.</i>

33:04.649 --> 33:08.152
And I went back, and he was
as cool as a cucumber.

33:09.070 --> 33:11.948
<i>I didn't kill anybody.</i>
<i>Bianchi killed all these girls.</i>

33:12.031 --> 33:13.533
<i>I don't know anything about it.</i>

33:13.908 --> 33:16.411
<i>He is a hard street guy.</i>

33:17.286 --> 33:19.372
And you can't shake him.

33:19.455 --> 33:21.916
You can't rock his boat with anything.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.710
<i>We advised him of his rights,</i>

33:23.793 --> 33:26.212
<i>and he told us that</i>
<i>you'll never prove anything.</i>

33:29.966 --> 33:32.051
HOLES: <i>Police have arrested</i>
<i>Angelo Buono,</i>

33:32.135 --> 33:35.054
but they did not have a strong enough case
against Buono.

33:35.138 --> 33:38.099
They didn't have the physical evidence
like latent prints.

33:38.182 --> 33:40.351
They had a circumstantial case.

33:40.768 --> 33:42.395
<i>That's why investigators were desperate.</i>

33:42.478 --> 33:45.565
<i>They needed to find evidence</i>
<i>that would implicate Buono</i>

33:45.648 --> 33:47.316
<i>in front of a jury.</i>

33:47.984 --> 33:49.610
Police had searched Buono's home

33:49.694 --> 33:52.196
earlier that year and found nothing.

33:52.280 --> 33:54.282
<i>The hope was that based on the information</i>

33:54.365 --> 33:55.950
<i>provided by Kenneth Bianchi,</i>

33:56.034 --> 33:58.411
<i>police would be able</i>
<i>to search the house again</i>

33:58.494 --> 34:01.039
<i>and find something new which would help.</i>

34:02.498 --> 34:03.958
GEORGE HERRERA: I was summoned

34:04.042 --> 34:08.046
to Angelo Buono's place of business
and his residence.

34:08.129 --> 34:11.799
<i>I was assigned to dust the entire location</i>
<i>for latent prints</i>

34:11.883 --> 34:14.844
<i>to see if we could come up</i>
<i>with anything of value.</i>

34:14.927 --> 34:18.222
We were hoping obviously
to develop any kind of prints

34:18.306 --> 34:20.975
<i>that belonged to any of the victims.</i>

34:21.059 --> 34:25.063
I remember dusting virtually
the entire location.

34:25.229 --> 34:29.150
(camera shutter clicking)

34:29.442 --> 34:31.319
It was like totally void

34:31.402 --> 34:33.446
of almost any kind
of latent prints at all.

34:41.662 --> 34:43.081
BOREN: <i>The search of the shop</i>

34:43.164 --> 34:45.124
<i>turned up lots of cords and ropes,</i>

34:45.500 --> 34:48.795
plenty of ropes that matched
the ligature marks on the girls.

34:48.878 --> 34:53.716
It also turned up material used
to gag or blindfold the victims.

34:56.594 --> 34:58.262
<i>In the desk drawer of the shop,</i>

34:58.346 --> 34:59.555
<i>they found a wallet.</i>

34:59.639 --> 35:01.724
<i>It had Buono's driver's license in it.</i>

35:01.808 --> 35:04.060
<i>It had pictures of several girls.</i>

35:04.393 --> 35:07.105
<i>And on the plastic inserts</i>
<i>that held the pictures</i>

35:07.980 --> 35:10.191
was the impression of a badge.

35:16.948 --> 35:19.367
MURPHY: <i>Detectives had theorized</i>
<i>that one of the methods</i>

35:19.826 --> 35:22.328
<i>these people were using to get</i>
<i>these women into their car</i>

35:22.411 --> 35:23.871
<i>and get them in vulnerable positions</i>

35:23.955 --> 35:25.915
<i>was pretending to be police officers.</i>

35:25.998 --> 35:27.375
(dog barking)

35:27.458 --> 35:28.876
(girl screams)

35:34.841 --> 35:37.552
This is a huge deal
because up to this time,

35:37.635 --> 35:39.428
<i>the police didn't have any actual evidence</i>

35:39.512 --> 35:41.222
<i>to support that theory.</i>

35:43.850 --> 35:46.519
<i>Police also take this leather chair</i>

35:46.602 --> 35:48.688
<i>that Bianchi described as having been used</i>

35:48.771 --> 35:50.398
<i>in every single one of these murders,</i>

35:50.481 --> 35:52.567
and they take it to the lab
where they analyze it

35:52.650 --> 35:54.819
and it becomes
hugely significant in the case.

35:56.904 --> 35:58.865
They bring it in, chair and everything.

35:59.407 --> 36:02.285
and we found lots of fibers.

36:02.368 --> 36:04.912
<i>Our analyst begins to compare these fibers</i>

36:05.580 --> 36:09.041
<i>with those that I collected</i>
<i>from Lauren Wagner's hands.</i>

36:12.170 --> 36:13.421
GROGAN: <i>They looked at every fiber</i>

36:13.504 --> 36:16.007
<i>in their entire collection of fibers</i>

36:17.341 --> 36:18.968
<i>and found a match.</i>

36:19.260 --> 36:23.181
Those fibers belonged
to Angelo's chair in his house.

36:23.764 --> 36:26.517
See, this is a major mistake they made.

36:27.059 --> 36:30.396
<i>There was residue on the fingertips</i>
<i>of Lauren Wagner</i>

36:30.479 --> 36:32.857
<i>that never was found</i>
<i>on any of the other victims.</i>

36:33.191 --> 36:37.111
Because they used adhesive tape
to tie electrical wires

36:37.195 --> 36:39.363
to her fingers to electrocute her.

36:39.780 --> 36:42.450
<i>When they took the wires off,</i>
<i>that left residue.</i>

36:42.533 --> 36:45.077
<i>The fibers of the chair</i>
<i>matched the fibers found</i>

36:45.161 --> 36:46.871
<i>on Lauren Wagner's fingers.</i>

36:47.788 --> 36:50.708
<i>That residue was picked up</i>
<i>when she was put in that chair.</i>

36:52.168 --> 36:56.923
And that put Buono's house
in the center of the murders.

36:57.715 --> 36:59.383
Hard to dodge that one.

37:02.261 --> 37:05.640
REPORTER: <i>The defense is talking about</i>
<i>attacking the credibility</i>

37:05.723 --> 37:08.976
<i>or the sanity of the</i>
<i>star witness Kenneth Bianchi.</i>

37:09.060 --> 37:13.064
<i>Do you feel you can establish</i>
<i>Ken as a credible witness in court?</i>

37:13.147 --> 37:15.566
<i>Obviously we would or we wouldn't</i>
<i>have filed a case, yes, sir.</i>

37:15.650 --> 37:17.151
MURPHY: <i>As excited as everybody was</i>

37:17.235 --> 37:19.737
about having gotten this statement
from Kenneth Bianchi,

37:19.820 --> 37:21.739
<i>this case still had a long way to go.</i>

37:23.783 --> 37:25.159
GROGAN: <i>Arrest is nothing.</i>

37:25.243 --> 37:27.078
That's first step.

37:27.662 --> 37:29.163
<i>Trial is the name of the game.</i>

37:30.081 --> 37:32.083
MICHAEL NASH: <i>Prior to the actual trial,</i>

37:32.166 --> 37:33.876
<i>there had been a preliminary hearing</i>

37:33.960 --> 37:36.504
that lasted about a year.

37:36.879 --> 37:38.756
MURPHY: <i>The preliminary hearing</i>
<i>is determined</i>

37:39.090 --> 37:41.759
<i>to assess the evidence</i>
<i>and figure out how strong it is</i>

37:41.842 --> 37:44.470
<i>or if there's probable cause</i>
<i>against Angelo Buono,</i>

37:44.553 --> 37:46.973
and usually these hearings
don't last very long.

37:47.431 --> 37:49.684
NASH: <i>And Ken Bianchi testified,</i>

37:49.767 --> 37:51.519
<i>uh, during the preliminary hearing,</i>

37:51.936 --> 37:54.355
and he testified every which way.

37:56.649 --> 38:00.027
<i>I did it, I didn't do it,</i>
<i>I don't recall, I don't know.</i>

38:01.404 --> 38:03.364
He--he made a mess of things.

38:03.656 --> 38:06.284
<i>Mr. Bianchi's change in testimony</i>

38:06.367 --> 38:07.618
<i>makes the case more difficult for us,</i>

38:07.702 --> 38:08.703
<i>there's no question about it.</i>

38:10.538 --> 38:13.416
McEACHRAN: <i>The reports that I got back</i>
<i>is that he wasn't cooperating.</i>

38:13.499 --> 38:15.293
<i>They didn't think he was being honest.</i>

38:16.002 --> 38:18.087
<i>Consequently, I got a call</i>

38:18.170 --> 38:21.007
from the district attorney in Los Angeles.

38:21.340 --> 38:22.967
And he called me and he said
"We've decided

38:23.050 --> 38:25.761
"we're gonna dismiss
the charges against Buono,

38:25.845 --> 38:27.346
<i>that we can't go ahead."</i>

38:28.764 --> 38:32.226
NASH: Between all
of Bianchi's machinations,

38:32.310 --> 38:36.188
the--the prosecutors on that case thought

38:36.397 --> 38:38.065
well, this case is not winnable.

38:38.149 --> 38:42.403
And so, they went to the--the actual DA

38:42.486 --> 38:44.947
and said we can't win this case,

38:45.364 --> 38:47.199
we should just move to dismiss it.

38:50.119 --> 38:51.746
GROGAN: <i>We could not believe it.</i>

38:51.829 --> 38:55.374
I was, uh, so pissed off at Roger Kelly

38:55.458 --> 38:57.168
<i>I could not see straight 'cause I thought</i>

38:57.251 --> 38:59.128
<i>he was the most incompetent prosecutor</i>

38:59.211 --> 39:00.713
<i>I had ever met in my life.</i>

39:01.672 --> 39:03.591
We can't do this. We gotta move.

39:03.674 --> 39:05.676
We have-- we're not gonna get
any more evidence

39:05.760 --> 39:06.927
<i>than what we already have</i>

39:07.011 --> 39:08.346
<i>and we've got a district attorney</i>

39:08.429 --> 39:10.097
<i>that says that's not good enough.</i>

39:10.598 --> 39:14.310
<i>The only evidence they thought</i>
<i>they had against Buono was Bianchi,</i>

39:14.393 --> 39:16.937
<i>and they didn't believe that anybody would</i>
<i>believe Bianchi.</i>

39:17.021 --> 39:19.398
<i>He would make a joke</i>
<i>out of this whole thing.</i>

39:20.024 --> 39:22.109
I was in the courtroom
when he made the motion.

39:22.360 --> 39:24.445
And Buono turned around and smiled at me

39:24.528 --> 39:26.238
<i>with the biggest grin</i>
<i>you ever seen in your life.</i>

39:26.322 --> 39:27.615
<i>I wanted to go kill him.</i>

39:29.325 --> 39:30.659
He's gonna walk.

39:30.743 --> 39:32.119
<i>He's gonna walk!</i>
