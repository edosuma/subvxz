00:14.556 --> 00:17.475
One-one-seven-two-five-two. Dahmer.

00:25.567 --> 00:28.737
One-one-nine-nine-four-two. Bryant.

00:29.320 --> 00:31.531
One-one-six-six-five-four.

00:36.995 --> 00:39.873
Hey, I put in a request
for two cyanide capsules

00:39.956 --> 00:41.249
and a razor blade.

00:42.459 --> 00:44.210
Will you check on those for me?

01:12.572 --> 01:16.576
<i>Dear Jeff, My friends</i>
<i>think I'm crazy for writing to you,</i>

01:16.659 --> 01:18.203
<i>but I wanted to say hi.</i>

01:18.703 --> 01:21.331
<i>Do you know</i>
<i>that you're a Halloween costume now?</i>

01:22.040 --> 01:25.001
<i>Three different guys at my school</i>
<i>went as you for Halloween,</i>

01:25.085 --> 01:26.961
<i>and everybody freaked out,</i>

01:27.045 --> 01:30.465
<i>and now they say next year</i>
<i>nobody's allowed to come dressed up.</i>

01:31.216 --> 01:33.551
<i>They made a comic book</i>
<i>about you, did you know?</i>

01:38.223 --> 01:42.102
<i>I think it's cool.</i>
<i>I've always been into scary stuff.</i>

01:44.771 --> 01:47.816
<i>Will you send me back,</i>
<i>like, a drawing or something?</i>

01:47.899 --> 01:49.234
<i>And I sent you five dollars.</i>

01:58.743 --> 02:03.373
<i>I'll send you more if you write back.</i>
<i>Your biggest fan, Alice.</i>

03:27.457 --> 03:30.293
You ever notice
how this looks just like a human thumb?

03:33.213 --> 03:35.757
At least that's how they look
when I was done with 'em.

03:38.509 --> 03:42.764
No, actually, more like this.

03:46.517 --> 03:48.603
-Mmm.
-You're a fucking freak, dude.

03:49.270 --> 03:50.480
Sit your white ass down!

03:53.900 --> 03:55.318
I don't like that, son.

04:01.616 --> 04:02.909
My fans do.

04:13.586 --> 04:15.755
You know, you don't <i>have </i>to go back there.

04:15.838 --> 04:18.091
You could stay with us
for as long as you need to.

04:18.174 --> 04:21.719
Uh-uh. I won't be anyone's burden,
and that's the end of it.

04:21.803 --> 04:25.473
-But, Mama, it's not--
-It's the end of it. But thank you.

04:25.556 --> 04:27.267
Go get the rest of that stuff.

04:39.654 --> 04:41.406
They ever gonna let up?

04:42.323 --> 04:45.326
Give it time.
Something else will come along.

05:01.801 --> 05:02.885
I'll get it.

05:12.937 --> 05:14.063
Come on, Mama.

05:35.877 --> 05:36.919
Oh…

05:38.379 --> 05:41.341
-Ugh. No, I'm sorry… No, this is crazy.
-What?

05:41.424 --> 05:43.968
Mama, you can't stay here,
and I won't let you.

05:45.803 --> 05:48.514
I mean… Oh God, I can still smell it.

05:48.598 --> 05:50.600
What he did to those people…

05:52.226 --> 05:54.979
The death, murder?
I know you smell it too.

05:56.522 --> 05:59.692
If you… If you want
to be stubborn and not admit it, okay.

06:00.318 --> 06:02.153
But don't lie. You taught me better.

06:02.987 --> 06:05.656
And where else am I supposed to go, huh?

06:06.199 --> 06:08.326
Couldn't afford it even if I wanted to.

06:08.409 --> 06:10.870
-Well, then let me help you.
-Sandra, no.

06:11.829 --> 06:13.998
He has taken enough from this world.

06:15.583 --> 06:18.336
He's not taking my home. I won't let him.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.589
Well then, promise me this.

06:21.672 --> 06:24.092
If you get scared at all,
go where the others go.

06:24.175 --> 06:26.677
You know where everyone else
is going at night, right?

06:26.761 --> 06:28.221
I'm fine.

06:28.971 --> 06:30.556
Promise me.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.726
Okay! I promise. Goodness.

06:33.810 --> 06:34.852
Will you stop?

06:34.936 --> 06:37.438
You acting like Jeff Dahmer
gonna jump out the shadows

06:37.522 --> 06:38.648
and try to get me.

06:38.731 --> 06:40.024
He's locked up.

06:40.108 --> 06:42.235
Gone. Forever.

06:44.362 --> 06:48.032
Okay. Okay, well, just call me at least.

06:48.116 --> 06:50.368
And please get some rest.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.704
-I will.
-Okay?

06:53.788 --> 06:54.789
I will.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.052
Ha!

07:17.979 --> 07:18.896
Hey!

07:22.150 --> 07:24.944
If I gave you 20 bucks,
you think you could get me something?

07:31.409 --> 07:33.536
What the fuck is that?

07:35.288 --> 07:38.124
Turn that
fucking shit off, Dahmer!

07:38.207 --> 07:40.084
I'm trying to fucking sleep!

07:59.270 --> 08:00.313
-Ah!

08:00.396 --> 08:02.148
Dahmer, turn that off!

08:04.025 --> 08:06.402
Why? I was just trying to get some sleep.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.279
Turn it off and give it to me!

08:12.492 --> 08:13.534
It's mine.

08:14.744 --> 08:15.953
You can't just take it.

08:16.412 --> 08:18.915
Give it to me,
or you're going in the hole.

08:22.835 --> 08:24.337
Fuck.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.310
Who says I can't have that?

08:39.852 --> 08:43.981
You like that, huh?
The sounds of people getting killed?

08:45.775 --> 08:47.193
It's whale noises.

08:47.693 --> 08:50.321
They're soothing to me. It helps me sleep.

08:50.404 --> 08:52.490
I can't turn off the lights in here.

08:53.282 --> 08:57.119
Yeah? Well, take it up with the warden.

08:59.121 --> 09:01.123
I paid for that! You can't just take it!

09:01.207 --> 09:02.333
Fuck you, Dahmer.

09:04.085 --> 09:07.129
-Should have given you the electric chair.
-I asked them to.

09:07.713 --> 09:09.632
They gave me 900 years instead.

09:10.841 --> 09:12.176
Come on, man.

09:12.260 --> 09:14.762
I'll just get more whale noises, dude!

09:15.263 --> 09:16.931
Shut the fuck up, Dahmer!

09:17.640 --> 09:19.350
Shut the fuck up!

09:58.681 --> 10:00.016
<i>Dear Ms. Hughes.</i>

10:00.099 --> 10:02.810
<i>Would you be so kind</i>
<i>as to autograph this for me?</i>

10:02.893 --> 10:06.272
<i>I've included a return envelope</i>
<i>with postage for your convenience.</i>

10:07.481 --> 10:10.901
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Josh Mahoney, Champaign, Illinois.</i>

10:25.750 --> 10:28.085
I understand your anger, Ms. Hughes,

10:28.169 --> 10:31.088
but civil suits can take years,

10:31.172 --> 10:34.216
and even if we win, it's unclear
how much money we'll actually get

10:34.300 --> 10:37.345
from the city
or the small publishing companies,

10:37.428 --> 10:39.347
like the one that released the comic book.

10:39.430 --> 10:42.016
Mr. Goldstein,
I'm not doing this for money.

10:42.099 --> 10:44.810
No amount of money
can bring my son Tony back.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.229
This is an evil book.

10:47.313 --> 10:49.148
Evil, with evil intent.

10:49.690 --> 10:52.818
Somebody has got to pay for this
and be held accountable.

10:53.569 --> 10:54.528
Agreed.

10:55.237 --> 10:57.323
Here, I want you to look at this.

10:59.033 --> 11:01.952
Jeffrey Dahmer's father
has written a book,

11:02.536 --> 11:06.457
and my guess is it's gonna sell
way more copies than some comic book.

11:07.291 --> 11:11.087
I got to know Lionel and his wife Shari
a little during the trial.

11:11.545 --> 11:13.172
They seemed like decent people.

11:13.255 --> 11:15.341
Look, on top of suing the city,

11:15.424 --> 11:17.968
I say we go after Dahmer and his family.

11:18.052 --> 11:21.305
Intercept any money
they might make from book deals, uh…

11:21.389 --> 11:23.724
movie, TV rights, paid interviews.

11:23.808 --> 11:25.768
Hell, even small donations

11:25.851 --> 11:28.312
that Dahmer's fans
might be sending him in prison.

11:28.396 --> 11:30.398
And they are. I read that in the paper.

11:30.898 --> 11:33.484
Don't let him make one goddamn dime.

11:34.443 --> 11:39.615
I don't know. I mean, suing the city,
going after Dahmer, that feels right.

11:40.241 --> 11:44.245
Going after his family?
After what they've been through too?

11:47.707 --> 11:50.042
They could make millions.

11:50.126 --> 11:52.545
Sure, uh, they might be decent people,

11:53.129 --> 11:58.634
but, um, I don't think he's gonna be
sharing any of that money with you

11:58.718 --> 12:00.469
or any of the other victims' families.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.221
Not voluntarily anyway.

12:03.889 --> 12:06.892
So… are you up for this fight?

12:15.901 --> 12:19.655
"Lionel Dahmer's analysis
of his hopelessly flawed relationship

12:19.739 --> 12:23.868
with his son Jeffrey is particularly
unpleasant for a parent to read."

12:23.951 --> 12:27.288
"It might be possible
to dismiss <i>A Father's Story</i>

12:27.371 --> 12:32.084
were it not for the palpable pain
and despair that gusts from the text."

12:32.168 --> 12:35.045
"What makes
Lionel Dahmer's narrative so compelling…"

12:35.129 --> 12:37.173
Ooh, "compelling."

12:37.882 --> 12:43.095
"…is that he is trying in this ascription
to peer not just into the soul of his son

12:43.721 --> 12:45.264
but into his own."

12:48.017 --> 12:50.686
Oh, honey. This is fantastic.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.855
I don't-- It's pretty good, I think.

12:52.938 --> 12:54.815
-What does your agent think?

12:54.899 --> 12:58.110
Leonard? Oh, he's excited.
Yeah, it's the <i>New York Times</i>, so…

12:58.194 --> 12:59.695
Oh, honey, this is a…

13:00.404 --> 13:03.699
This is fantastic.
This deserves a toast, huh?

13:05.201 --> 13:08.245
To my hubby, the best-selling author.

13:08.329 --> 13:10.956
Hey, uh, let's not
get ahead of ourselves, sweetheart.

13:14.418 --> 13:15.294
Mm.

13:16.504 --> 13:19.048
<i>And we're back</i>
<i>with Lionel and Shari Dahmer.</i>

13:19.131 --> 13:21.967
<i>His book, </i>A Father's Story,

13:22.051 --> 13:25.221
<i>about serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer</i>
<i>is about to hit the shelves.</i>

13:25.304 --> 13:29.391
<i>Now, Lionel, over the break,</i>
<i>you mentioned there was some interest</i>

13:29.475 --> 13:31.352
<i>in turning the book into a movie?</i>

13:31.435 --> 13:32.478
<i>It's a possibility.</i>

13:32.561 --> 13:34.814
<i>There is, uh…</i>
<i>It's called an option.</i>

13:34.897 --> 13:39.944
<i>And there's a couple of guys</i>
<i>named Ambler and Dickinson</i>

13:40.694 --> 13:45.491
<i>in Kansas City that would</i>
<i>like to make a feature film of…</i>

13:45.574 --> 13:48.410
-Hey, Dahmer. Let's go.
<i>-…of the whole story.</i>

13:48.494 --> 13:49.620
<i>A Father's Story.</i>

13:49.703 --> 13:52.331
-Sorry. What am I supposed to do?
-A Father's Story.

13:52.414 --> 13:54.041
-<i> And you'd cooperate.</i>
-<i>Yes.</i>

13:54.124 --> 13:55.376
My dad's on TV.

13:55.459 --> 13:59.338
<i> Any casting ideas</i>
<i>of who would play the two of you?</i>

13:59.839 --> 14:01.257
<i>Oh, I don't know.</i>

14:02.049 --> 14:04.051
<i>Jon Voight, maybe. Faye Dunaway.</i>

14:04.134 --> 14:06.512
What do you mean,
I have to pay 'em the profits?

14:06.595 --> 14:08.472
How can we do that? There are no profits.

14:08.556 --> 14:11.141
Well, in a way,
that's the silver lining.

14:11.225 --> 14:14.728
The book hasn't sold the 50,000 copies
that would have turned a profit,

14:14.812 --> 14:16.438
so there's nothing to hand over.

14:16.522 --> 14:19.066
But what… So if it does?

14:19.775 --> 14:21.026
Then yes,

14:21.110 --> 14:24.196
the judge said that the families
would be entitled to those profits.

14:25.489 --> 14:29.368
-They're going after Jeff's money too.
-Well, Jeff doesn't have any money.

14:29.451 --> 14:32.913
Well, he earns 25 cents an hour
working in the prison,

14:32.997 --> 14:34.790
and people send him money.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.293
All he does is buy coffee
and cigarettes with that.

14:37.376 --> 14:38.711
Well, he won't be able to anymore.

14:38.794 --> 14:40.796
Judge said the families
would be entitled to that.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.798
Oh, jeez. This is just… This is…

14:42.882 --> 14:45.759
Look, I understand
that people are in pain. I do.

14:45.843 --> 14:48.637
But, really? Twenty-five cents?

14:48.721 --> 14:50.139
Now who exactly, um…

14:52.308 --> 14:53.684
Which one of them is this?

14:55.561 --> 14:57.062
It's <i>all </i>of the families.

15:37.061 --> 15:38.187
-Hello?

15:38.270 --> 15:40.856
<i>Why don't you</i>
<i>go back to where you came from?</i>

15:40.940 --> 15:41.815
Hello?

15:41.899 --> 15:45.319
<i>Nobody wants you here!</i>
<i>Get on a fucking boat and go back!</i>

16:22.481 --> 16:23.774
Relax.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.610
I just wanna take some pictures.

16:28.487 --> 16:29.655
Come on.

16:30.739 --> 16:32.324
I wanna show you something.

17:01.311 --> 17:03.022
<i> You knew about him!</i>

17:32.259 --> 17:33.677
Watch what happens.

19:29.418 --> 19:33.005
<i>Today, we are gathered</i>
<i>to celebrate bravery,</i>

19:33.964 --> 19:38.010
valor, resolve, and exemplary courage.

19:38.802 --> 19:41.054
Courage in the face of danger,

19:41.930 --> 19:43.473
in the face of great doubt.

19:43.974 --> 19:45.058
Heroes.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.395
That's who I see
when I look out across this room.

19:49.229 --> 19:52.065
Each one of you represents the best of us.

19:53.066 --> 19:55.903
Everyday citizens,
driven in your life, not by reward,

19:56.612 --> 19:57.821
but by principle.

19:58.530 --> 20:01.491
To do what is right. And just.

20:01.575 --> 20:05.370
When the mobs came,
these two men stood their ground.

20:06.288 --> 20:08.874
And we stood beside them,
and we fought for them

20:08.957 --> 20:12.252
and for all of us who put on a badge

20:12.336 --> 20:14.963
and serve as a hallowed reminder

20:15.797 --> 20:18.300
that we take care of our own.

20:18.383 --> 20:21.970
Facing great obstacles,
this brave woman went above and beyond

20:22.054 --> 20:23.972
to try and protect her community.

20:25.015 --> 20:27.601
Displaying unyielding resolve,

20:27.684 --> 20:30.979
typifying the great spirit of Milwaukee.

20:31.980 --> 20:35.317
I'm pleased to call to the stage,
this year's recipient

20:35.400 --> 20:36.693
of the Citizens Merit Award…

20:37.236 --> 20:39.947
<i>It is with great pride and honor</i>

20:40.030 --> 20:42.407
that I call to the stage the recipients

20:42.491 --> 20:46.787
of the Milwaukee Police Association's
Officers of the Year Award.

20:46.870 --> 20:48.163
Glenda Cleveland.

20:50.332 --> 20:54.086
John Balcerzak and Joseph Gabrish.

21:15.107 --> 21:19.403
Thank you, Chief.
This is a step in the right direction.

21:21.154 --> 21:25.200
Honestly, I'm at a loss for words.

21:27.452 --> 21:28.870
I just…

21:31.373 --> 21:34.459
I will accept this award on one condition.

21:35.085 --> 21:37.296
That in the future, you do better.

21:39.548 --> 21:44.845
This is for the Konerak boy
and for all the other victims.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.058
Don't let this happen again.

22:01.111 --> 22:03.280
<i>We intend to sue the city in federal court</i>

22:03.363 --> 22:06.199
for violating your son's right
to equal protection.

22:06.283 --> 22:09.494
The police had a constitutional duty
to protect your son,

22:09.578 --> 22:10.746
and they failed.

22:10.829 --> 22:13.874
We seek ten million dollars
in damages for your family.

22:14.458 --> 22:18.128
I know that even that amount of money
will do nothing to ease the suffering

22:18.211 --> 22:19.713
that you're feeling right now.

22:20.213 --> 22:21.965
But it sends the right message.

22:22.632 --> 22:24.760
A sum like that goes a long way

22:24.843 --> 22:27.346
in making your lives
just a little bit easier.

22:33.143 --> 22:36.313
I understand that they're
auctioning off Dahmer's belongings,

22:36.396 --> 22:39.816
and I'm gonna make sure
100% of those proceeds go to the victims.

22:40.484 --> 22:42.652
Which, of course, includes your family.

23:35.330 --> 23:37.207
-Shut up!
-Help!

23:43.547 --> 23:44.423
Help!

23:48.552 --> 23:49.428
Put it down!

23:49.511 --> 23:50.387
Help!

24:03.942 --> 24:06.194
<i>…you're gonna</i>
<i>absolutely love this product.</i>

24:06.278 --> 24:09.448
<i>Basically, you just drape it</i>
<i>directly over your shoulders,</i>

24:09.531 --> 24:11.450
<i>and you can use it like a backpack.</i>

24:11.533 --> 24:15.036
<i>It's like nothing else on the market.</i>
<i>It's easy to use, and it's easy for you.</i>

24:15.120 --> 24:16.872
<i>It comes in at a low price--</i>

24:43.607 --> 24:45.525
-Thank you.
You're welcome.

24:46.735 --> 24:48.737
I've seen you in the building before.

24:49.237 --> 24:51.781
Dana. 201, end of the hall.

24:51.865 --> 24:54.743
Well, it's nice
to finally meet you. Glenda.

24:55.494 --> 24:57.996
I read about you in the paper,
trying to help that boy.

24:59.164 --> 25:01.500
That was a good thing you tried to do.

25:02.501 --> 25:03.960
Yeah, well,

25:04.044 --> 25:06.546
good as it was, what it get us?

25:06.630 --> 25:08.840
Still can't sleep in our own bed.

25:09.341 --> 25:10.967
You having nightmares?

25:12.677 --> 25:13.762
Me too,

25:13.845 --> 25:16.515
but this is where
we're all coming for comfort, right?

25:17.015 --> 25:18.350
Look, I told my daughter.

25:18.433 --> 25:21.353
I said, "I'll come down if I get scared."

25:21.436 --> 25:24.898
You know, I say, "I'm fine, Sandra.
Don't worry about me, Sandra."

25:24.981 --> 25:26.816
"He ain't gonna get the best of me."

25:26.900 --> 25:29.903
But he's in my nerves, in my brain.

25:29.986 --> 25:32.030
-I can't get it to stop.

25:32.739 --> 25:35.659
I got arthritis, real bad. Both knees.

25:36.159 --> 25:38.453
Hate going up and down stairs.

25:38.537 --> 25:43.041
But when I got trash to take out,
I take it up to the third floor,

25:43.124 --> 25:46.044
down the hall,
all the way down to the alley,

25:46.127 --> 25:50.340
just so I don't have to walk past
that son of a bitch's apartment.

25:52.384 --> 25:56.930
Next time your trash need to go out,
you set it right outside your door.

25:58.723 --> 26:01.142
That's sweet of you, Glenda,
but no need to.

26:01.226 --> 26:04.521
Oh, uh-uh.
Girl, we got to look out for each other.

26:06.898 --> 26:08.358
Okay. Mm.

26:32.173 --> 26:34.259
<i>Get up, baby, fucking get up.</i>

26:34.342 --> 26:35.218
Hello?

26:35.885 --> 26:38.471
<i>Ten million dollars, huh?</i>
<i>You fucking gook.</i>

26:38.555 --> 26:41.641
<i>How about you leave well enough alone</i>
<i>and fuck off back to your rice paddy?</i>

27:02.579 --> 27:03.663
Excuse me.

27:05.290 --> 27:06.750
Excuse me, everyone.

27:07.751 --> 27:09.544
Can I have your attention please?

27:12.797 --> 27:17.135
I am sorry, but due to safety reasons,

27:17.719 --> 27:21.806
I have been told I can no longer
allow residents to sleep in the lobby.

27:23.642 --> 27:27.270
But… But after speaking
with the owners of the building,

27:27.354 --> 27:29.230
for those wishing to remain,

27:29.314 --> 27:33.610
I am pleased to inform
that your rent will be lowered by 25%.

27:35.236 --> 27:39.949
And for those wishing to break your lease,
there will be no penalty in doing so.

27:42.077 --> 27:43.161
Thank you.

28:33.670 --> 28:37.048
Excuse me.
My name is Glenda Cleveland, and I--

28:37.132 --> 28:39.926
Yes, I know who you are.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

28:40.719 --> 28:41.970
I'm George Hecker.

28:42.595 --> 28:44.931
I helped bring the family over from Laos.

28:48.601 --> 28:52.981
They never found a whole body.
You know, just… parts.

28:54.733 --> 28:57.986
Took a while,
but we finally raised the funds for this.

28:58.987 --> 29:02.991
The archdiocese chipped in for the casket
so we could have a proper memorial.

29:04.075 --> 29:06.953
I was… I was wondering if I could…

29:07.620 --> 29:09.539
This is the boy's mother?

29:09.622 --> 29:10.498
Yes.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.083
I don't wanna, um…

29:15.462 --> 29:17.589
Maybe I could speak with his father?

29:18.757 --> 29:20.091
Certainly, yes.

29:31.436 --> 29:32.645
I beg your pardon.

29:37.108 --> 29:38.985
Mr. Sinthasomphone,

29:39.778 --> 29:41.613
I'm Glenda Cleveland.

29:42.113 --> 29:46.242
I was the one
who called the police about your son.

29:47.118 --> 29:48.453
I live in the building.

29:51.414 --> 29:52.415
I am…

29:53.082 --> 29:54.626
I am so sorry.

29:57.337 --> 29:59.255
I knew something was wrong.

30:01.466 --> 30:06.095
And I never should have trusted the police
when they said everything was okay.

30:07.847 --> 30:09.098
'Cause it wasn't.

30:11.100 --> 30:12.143
It's okay.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.979
No. It isn't.

30:18.441 --> 30:21.236
You do everything you can.

30:41.548 --> 30:44.217
Hi. I'm here to see Catherine Dahmer.

30:46.386 --> 30:48.972
So now, the movie isn't happening.

30:51.057 --> 30:53.268
Producers got cold feet, I guess.

30:56.062 --> 30:58.690
I don't know
if it was even a good idea, you know.

30:59.357 --> 31:03.862
But all I ever really wanted to do
was to help other parents to, you know,

31:05.113 --> 31:06.823
look out for the warning signs.

31:09.617 --> 31:10.660
Well…

31:14.247 --> 31:16.624
I'd have had Raquel Welch play you, Ma.

31:17.917 --> 31:19.419
I know you always liked her.

31:21.379 --> 31:22.338
Yeah.

31:23.256 --> 31:24.632
She'd have been good too.

31:37.145 --> 31:40.064
He really loved you, Ma. In his own way.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.527
And you did your best with him.

31:45.528 --> 31:47.113
As well as anybody could.

31:53.494 --> 31:55.705
You're a good mom to me, that's for sure.

32:02.670 --> 32:03.630
Okay.

32:07.175 --> 32:09.052
I'll come back, see you tomorrow, hmm?

32:18.811 --> 32:20.897
Yes, that's so sick.

32:21.856 --> 32:23.358
No, one more, one more, one more.

32:25.652 --> 32:27.487
What exactly
do you boys think you're doing?

32:27.570 --> 32:29.739
-Nothing. We're just having some fun.
-Fun?

32:29.822 --> 32:32.325
-Sandra, calm down.
-This isn't an amusement park.

32:32.408 --> 32:34.619
-It's my mama's home.
-Hey. Hey, hey.

32:34.702 --> 32:38.331
We are on the sidewalk, public property.
We're allowed to take pictures.

32:38.414 --> 32:39.457
Hey, what are you--

32:39.540 --> 32:42.627
What the fuck!?
You had no right to do that!

32:42.710 --> 32:44.879
People were murdered in here!

32:45.672 --> 32:46.631
Do y'all get that?

32:47.799 --> 32:49.550
Go home. Go!

32:50.885 --> 32:53.429
Sorry, Ma.
I shouldn't have lost my temper like that.

32:53.513 --> 32:55.556
Come on. Let's get the baby in the house.

32:56.057 --> 32:57.684
-You all right.

32:57.767 --> 33:00.979
<i>So, Jeff, one of</i>
<i>the questions your dad has in the book</i>

33:01.062 --> 33:03.106
<i>is when did you begin to slip?</i>

33:03.189 --> 33:05.775
Is it me, or does he look like
he gained some weight?

33:06.484 --> 33:10.113
Yeah, it looks like it.
Must be eating pretty good in prison.

33:10.196 --> 33:11.322
<i>…just couldn't return?</i>

33:12.240 --> 33:14.033
<i>Think it was around… </i>

33:14.117 --> 33:15.827
<i>…age 14 or 15.</i>

33:16.828 --> 33:17.704
<i>Started to have…</i>

33:18.371 --> 33:20.123
<i>having obsessive…</i>

33:21.374 --> 33:24.293
<i>thoughts of, uh…</i>

33:25.545 --> 33:28.256
<i>violence intermingled with sex.</i>

33:30.091 --> 33:33.219
<i>Was it</i>
<i>the killing that excited you?</i>

33:34.595 --> 33:37.223
<i>Or was it what happened </i>after <i>the killing?</i>

33:39.809 --> 33:42.937
<i>No, the killing</i>
<i>was just a means to an end.</i>

33:43.896 --> 33:46.441
<i>That… that was the least satisfactory…</i>

33:48.568 --> 33:49.777
Just turn it off.

33:49.861 --> 33:52.822
<i>That's why I tried to, uh…</i>

33:53.823 --> 33:57.827
<i>create living zombies with, uh…</i>

33:59.120 --> 34:01.205
<i>muriatic acid and the drill.</i>

34:02.290 --> 34:05.251
<i>One of those failed experiments</i>
<i>at creating a living zombie</i>

34:05.334 --> 34:07.253
<i>was conducted on this 14-year-old boy.</i>

34:07.336 --> 34:10.214
<i>Jeffrey had drilled a hole in his head</i>
<i>and poured in acid.</i>

34:10.298 --> 34:13.301
<i>A crude attempt at lobotomy</i>
<i>that none of his victims survived.</i>

34:15.595 --> 34:16.888
You all right, Mama?

34:19.057 --> 34:20.141
It ain't right.

34:22.268 --> 34:25.104
I don't know
why he gets to go on national TV

34:25.188 --> 34:27.148
to tell his side of the story.

34:27.231 --> 34:29.025
I hear you, girl,

34:29.108 --> 34:32.612
but maybe if we can understand
what motivated him, we can--

34:32.695 --> 34:34.155
I have had it!

34:35.031 --> 34:36.991
Living underneath his shadow, I--

34:38.910 --> 34:42.497
-This is not some Halloween story.
-I know.

34:42.580 --> 34:44.749
-This is my life. And I--

34:45.500 --> 34:46.709
Who is it?

34:46.793 --> 34:47.919
It's the police.

34:53.382 --> 34:54.383
Yes?

34:54.467 --> 34:55.384
Glenda Cleveland?

34:55.468 --> 34:56.385
Yes?

34:56.469 --> 34:57.678
May we come in?

34:57.762 --> 34:58.971
No, you may not.

34:59.555 --> 35:02.016
Your landlord told us
we might find a Sandra Smith here.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.643
She's your daughter? Yes?

35:04.310 --> 35:05.686
I'm Sandra Smith.

35:07.063 --> 35:08.940
-You have the right to remain silent.

35:09.023 --> 35:10.399
-I didn't do anything.
-What?

35:10.483 --> 35:12.735
-Wait. Why are you arresting my daughter?
-Settle down.

35:12.819 --> 35:14.112
Got a complaint from a young man,

35:14.195 --> 35:16.739
said your daughter assaulted him
and destroyed his camera.

35:16.823 --> 35:20.827
-He's pressing charges.
-That young man was trespassing.

35:20.910 --> 35:22.745
Did your daughter assault him?

35:24.997 --> 35:26.791
What precinct are y'all taking her to?

35:26.874 --> 35:29.460
-District One over on State Street--
-I know where it is.

35:54.986 --> 35:55.903
You see this?

35:55.987 --> 35:58.531
They're auctioning off
all of Jeffrey Dahmer's stuff.

35:58.614 --> 35:59.490
Morning, Rita.

35:59.574 --> 36:01.159
Like what? Skulls and whatnot?

36:01.242 --> 36:04.245
Yeah, I want that drill
that he made the zombies with.

36:04.328 --> 36:05.246
Morning, boss.

36:13.671 --> 36:17.008
Rita, get me Dean Reynolds
at Public Works.

36:20.595 --> 36:24.182
Well, whatever that number is,
I'm telling you I'll do 100K over it.

36:24.265 --> 36:25.266
Okay?

36:26.058 --> 36:28.811
But I get every single fuckin' item. Okay?

36:31.189 --> 36:32.481
Yeah, right there!

36:33.191 --> 36:34.317
That all of it?

36:35.401 --> 36:36.569
Whoa, look at this.

36:37.528 --> 36:40.740
You put that down, right now!
That's my property, asshole!

36:42.158 --> 36:45.036
Oh, don't you fuckin'
look at me like that.

36:45.119 --> 36:47.455
Your union rep's a dear friend of mine.

36:47.538 --> 36:50.583
I'll get your ass fired, you sack of shit!

36:50.666 --> 36:52.043
-All right.
-Easy.

36:55.630 --> 36:57.423
Fucking bury it!

37:03.971 --> 37:06.974
The judge dismissed our claim
the police had a constitutional duty

37:07.058 --> 37:08.226
to protect your son.

37:08.768 --> 37:10.603
But the city has agreed to settle,

37:10.686 --> 37:14.649
conceding that they violated his rights
to equal protection under the law.

37:14.732 --> 37:16.400
The number is not what we'd like.

37:16.484 --> 37:18.527
They're offering 850,000.

37:19.028 --> 37:21.030
But it's my advice that you take it.

37:21.113 --> 37:24.033
That way, you can finally move on
and start with the healing process.

37:40.341 --> 37:42.802
I'm Joe Zilber. You don't know me.

37:43.678 --> 37:46.764
I know the proceeds for the auction
were gonna go to the victims,

37:47.390 --> 37:49.225
but I just couldn't handle the idea

37:49.308 --> 37:52.186
that that stuff
would be a collector's item, right?

37:52.270 --> 37:55.815
So I paid a little more
and made sure it was all destroyed.

38:00.069 --> 38:01.821
This is your cut of it.

38:02.989 --> 38:05.283
Split between 11 families.

38:05.366 --> 38:06.993
Thirty-two thousand.

38:23.342 --> 38:24.176
Hello?

38:24.260 --> 38:26.095
<i>Why don't you take that 850,000</i>

38:26.178 --> 38:27.930
<i>and get on a nice big fucking plane</i>

38:28.014 --> 38:31.767
<i>and go back to the fucking jungle,</i>
<i>you slanty-eyed piece of shit?</i>

38:31.851 --> 38:35.229
You never call again, or I make you sorry!

38:39.066 --> 38:40.443
What are you two doing?

38:40.526 --> 38:42.236
-Uh, hey, Sarge.

38:42.820 --> 38:44.363
I thought you clocked out.

38:44.447 --> 38:46.574
-We're just finishing up.
-Making a phone call.

38:46.657 --> 38:47.700
Night, Sarge.

38:49.493 --> 38:51.329
So, Kareem,

38:52.413 --> 38:54.415
how've you been since our last talk?

38:56.584 --> 38:58.085
Okay, I guess.

38:58.711 --> 39:00.004
Well, you look healthy.

39:00.671 --> 39:01.505
Yeah.

39:02.423 --> 39:05.760
Since I tested positive
I've kinda cut myself off from people.

39:06.594 --> 39:08.220
<i>I don't go out anymore.</i>

39:09.638 --> 39:10.890
<i>Not to the club.</i>

39:12.391 --> 39:14.101
<i>Not to visit friends.</i>

39:14.935 --> 39:16.270
<i>Even family.</i>

39:20.274 --> 39:21.484
<i>I don't know.</i>

39:22.777 --> 39:24.028
<i>I just feel…</i>

39:25.404 --> 39:26.530
ashamed.

39:26.614 --> 39:27.490
Mm.

39:28.407 --> 39:30.326
It's hard to be around people.

39:31.952 --> 39:33.329
<i>It hurts too much.</i>

39:35.039 --> 39:36.082
Ron!

39:38.000 --> 39:39.126
Ron!

39:47.593 --> 39:49.220
I understand how you feel.

39:50.054 --> 39:53.099
-Yo, don't bullshit me.
-I'm not.

39:54.016 --> 39:55.101
Believe me.

39:56.143 --> 39:57.728
I understand.

40:38.310 --> 40:40.312
<i>You can't hide</i>
<i>in your apartment forever.</i>

40:41.730 --> 40:43.190
Sooner or later,

40:44.275 --> 40:47.153
you're gonna have to face your fears

40:48.112 --> 40:49.822
and start living again.

41:03.669 --> 41:04.670
Glenda.

41:05.171 --> 41:07.173
Mr. Princewill.

41:08.048 --> 41:09.175
Hey.

41:09.258 --> 41:11.594
So, you will be getting
an official notice,

41:11.677 --> 41:14.722
but I want to let you know
that the city is buying the building

41:15.264 --> 41:16.640
and it's being demolished.

41:18.184 --> 41:21.604
Demolished? So they just gon' kick us out?

41:22.313 --> 41:25.357
They're going to provide
relocation expenses for all the tenants.

41:25.858 --> 41:27.651
But yes, you need to move.

41:28.152 --> 41:29.612
How long we got?

41:29.695 --> 41:31.071
Sixty days.

41:32.615 --> 41:34.658
And what are they gonna replace it with?

41:35.326 --> 41:37.495
Don't know. I heard maybe a park.

41:37.578 --> 41:39.997
They should do some sort of a memorial,

41:40.664 --> 41:43.834
you know,
so people don't forget the victims.

41:43.918 --> 41:46.629
Something that will honor their memory.

41:46.712 --> 41:48.797
That's the least they could do.

41:49.965 --> 41:51.509
I'll be sure to tell them.

41:52.843 --> 41:54.094
I'm sorry, Glenda.

41:54.762 --> 41:55.846
For everything.

41:57.264 --> 41:58.390
Thank you.

41:59.558 --> 42:01.560
You're a good man, Mr. Princewill.

43:32.735 --> 43:36.071
You fucking deserve it!
You fucking deserve it, man!

43:36.155 --> 43:38.240
You fucking deserve it!

43:38.324 --> 43:40.951
-You don't deserve to be in here!

43:41.452 --> 43:45.164
-You fucking deserved it!

44:03.807 --> 44:06.143
<i>In the end, we tried to forget about it.</i>

44:06.852 --> 44:08.854
<i>Concentrate on other things,</i>

44:09.521 --> 44:13.609
<i>and above all else,</i>

44:16.111 --> 44:18.572
<i>Actually it's not such</i>

44:19.281 --> 44:20.532
<i>Not anymore.</i>

44:24.995 --> 44:25.871
<i>Knowledge,</i>

44:59.863 --> 45:02.950
<i>I read in the paper</i>

45:03.033 --> 45:04.660
<i>Made me laugh.</i>

45:04.743 --> 45:06.495
<i>They'll never kill you, man.</i>
