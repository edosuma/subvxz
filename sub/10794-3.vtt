WEBVTT

00:02.036 --> 00:04.572
RUSH: This is what Destiny
 intended from the moment
 it entered the star system.

00:04.605 --> 00:08.141
YOUNG: That ship
 is the best chance
 we have of getting home.

00:08.176 --> 00:09.310
Are we done?

00:09.343 --> 00:11.479
We'll never be done.

00:11.512 --> 00:13.247
WRAY: You shouldn't have
 left him on the planet.

00:13.281 --> 00:15.216
YOUNG: You think
 I don't know that?

00:15.249 --> 00:16.484
CHLOE: Everyone thinks
 we're safe.

00:16.517 --> 00:19.087
They think that
 they'll never
 find us again.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.754
Why did you take
 one of our people
 prisoner?

00:20.788 --> 00:22.323
(VOCALIZES)

00:22.356 --> 00:24.024
CHLOE: We're not safe,
 are we?

00:24.058 --> 00:25.926
TELFORD: They're coming!
 Who's coming?

00:25.959 --> 00:27.528
Lucian Alliance.
 They're coming
 to take Destiny.

00:27.561 --> 00:29.497
RUSH: There's only one way
 this is going to end
 if we wait.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.899
YOUNG: I'm not
 surrendering this ship.

00:31.932 --> 00:33.000
We need to kill them all.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.835
VARRO: Everyone
 except the doctors.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.270
And Lieutenant Johansen.

00:36.304 --> 00:38.372
JOHANSEN: Remember
 that planet that
 we stopped at?

00:38.406 --> 00:40.208
They have my baby.

00:40.241 --> 00:42.876
TELFORD: You have no idea
 what it's like to remember
 things you've done that...

00:42.910 --> 00:43.811
You weren't yourself.

00:45.213 --> 00:46.747
SCOTT: Riley is not
 going to make it, sir.

00:50.551 --> 00:54.122
GLORIA: You found
 the keys to controlling
 all Destiny's systems.

00:54.155 --> 00:57.024
And you're not
 going to tell
 anyone, are you?

00:57.057 --> 00:59.127
VOLKER: There's
 an object out there.
 YOUNG: What is it?

00:59.160 --> 01:01.195
We're not sure,
 but we're about
 to find out.

01:01.229 --> 01:02.130
We're headed
 straight for it.

01:20.414 --> 01:21.915
Do we know
 what it is?

01:22.916 --> 01:24.185
Not yet.

01:25.419 --> 01:26.820
Brody.

01:30.324 --> 01:31.759
Colonel.

01:31.792 --> 01:32.826
Ready weapons.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.430
I don't think
 that'll be necessary.

01:43.271 --> 01:44.472
It's a ship.

01:44.505 --> 01:46.039
It looks like Destiny.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.277
It's got to be
 of Ancient design.

01:51.279 --> 01:53.581
Colonel, this is Brody.
 Go ahead.

01:53.614 --> 01:56.184
We're not slowing down.
 We're on a collision course.

02:03.457 --> 02:04.992
Ready main weapon.

02:13.234 --> 02:15.436
We're going to hit it.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.905
No, no,
 we're not going to hit it.
 We're going to dock with it.

02:53.374 --> 02:55.142
You got any more
predictions?

02:55.175 --> 02:58.312
Yeah. I suspect that,
 very shortly

02:58.346 --> 03:00.948
you'll be
assembling a team
to send over there.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.913
YOUNG: How did you know
 we were going to dock?

03:32.946 --> 03:34.214
Call it a hunch.

03:36.384 --> 03:39.587
Given the second ship's
similarity in design,

03:39.620 --> 03:41.188
our calculated approach,

03:41.221 --> 03:42.890
well, I thought it was
rather obvious, really.

03:44.325 --> 03:47.094
So, what's happening here?

03:47.127 --> 03:49.697
Destiny is exchanging data
 with the seed ship.

03:49.730 --> 03:52.466
One of many traveling
 well ahead of Destiny,

03:52.500 --> 03:55.636
seeding planets
 with stargates,
 gathering information.

03:55.669 --> 03:58.105
This one obviously experienced
 some sort of system failure,

03:58.138 --> 03:59.407
allowing us to
 catch up with it.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.041
YOUNG: What kind of data?

04:01.074 --> 04:02.376
Difficult to say
 at the moment.

04:02.410 --> 04:04.144
It may take a while
 to translate.

04:04.177 --> 04:05.446
Well, then, you'd
 better get started.

04:05.479 --> 04:07.548
RUSH: Well, there's plenty
 of time for that later.

04:07.581 --> 04:11.084
For now, this is
 a fantastic opportunity,
 and I want to explore it.

04:11.118 --> 04:13.387
No, I'm sure you do,
 but I need you here.

04:13.421 --> 04:15.122
I need to know what
kind of information
we're receiving.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.661
No countdown clock.

04:20.694 --> 04:22.663
Yeah, I figure Destiny's
 going to give us as long
 as it takes.

04:22.696 --> 04:24.498
And how long is that?

04:24.532 --> 04:26.600
Given the amount of data
 and the rate of transfer,

04:26.634 --> 04:28.469
I'd guess at least
 two hours.

04:28.502 --> 04:31.171
Okay. Brody, Volker,
 you are on the away team.

04:31.204 --> 04:33.140
You have two hours.
Make it quick.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.075
(RUSH SCOFFS)

04:35.108 --> 04:37.010
With all due respect
 to Brody and Volker...

04:37.044 --> 04:39.613
They'll be fine.
 Call it a hunch.

04:45.319 --> 04:46.487
TELFORD: Camile.

04:50.157 --> 04:51.425
I thought you were
 being debriefed.

04:51.459 --> 04:55.596
Homeworld Command can wait.
What's going on with this
seed ship?

04:55.629 --> 04:58.599
Some sort of
data transfer's
been initiated.

04:58.632 --> 05:01.301
In the meantime,
 Colonel Young is sending
 a team over to investigate.

05:04.672 --> 05:05.706
David...

05:18.085 --> 05:19.387
SCOTT ON RADIO: All right,
 Colonel, we are good to go.

05:19.420 --> 05:20.688
Stand by.

05:30.263 --> 05:31.499
SCOTT: Heading in.

05:37.538 --> 05:40.307
Okay, we are
 at the airlock.

05:40.340 --> 05:43.110
ELI ON RADIO: Life support
 is active over there,
 so you have a go.

05:43.544 --> 05:45.012
Right.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.555
(DOOR CREAKING)

06:38.231 --> 06:40.534
That ship's older than
 Destiny and could be
 in pretty bad shape.

06:40.568 --> 06:42.235
Proceed with caution,
 Lieutenant.

06:42.269 --> 06:43.571
Yes, sir.

07:02.790 --> 07:04.091
ELI: It's incredible.

07:06.326 --> 07:10.564
Okay, maybe not as incredible
 as checking out a seed ship,

07:10.598 --> 07:13.801
but still,
 pretty damned incredible.

07:13.834 --> 07:15.736
There's no telling
 what kind of information
 we're getting here.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.738
It could be anything,

07:17.771 --> 07:21.108
from Ancient history
 to details of
 the Destiny's mission.

07:22.209 --> 07:23.310
Where are you going?

07:23.343 --> 07:25.312
The bathroom.
 Is that all right?

07:27.815 --> 07:32.252
Hey. T.J.
 There you are.

07:32.285 --> 07:35.155
Oh, God,
I was supposed to meet you
in the infirmary, wasn't I?

07:35.188 --> 07:36.423
About 20 minutes ago.

07:36.456 --> 07:37.725
Sorry.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.161
Are you okay?

07:41.194 --> 07:42.530
Yeah.

07:43.396 --> 07:45.933
You sure?

07:45.966 --> 07:48.335
After everything
 that's happened to you...

07:48.368 --> 07:50.170
Let's not
 do this here, okay?

07:50.203 --> 07:53.140
Okay, but look,
 you really should
 talk to someone.

07:54.642 --> 07:57.778
And I'm not saying
 that it has to be me.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.781
If there's someone else
 you'd feel more
 comfortable confiding in...

08:00.814 --> 08:02.349
It's not that.

08:02.382 --> 08:03.551
Then why aren't you...

08:03.584 --> 08:05.418
Because there's nothing
to talk about, Chloe.

08:08.756 --> 08:10.591
Look, I lost my baby.

08:12.392 --> 08:14.227
And now maybe
 she's in a better place.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.332
And maybe
 it's for the best.

08:19.366 --> 08:20.668
You can't mean that.

08:23.737 --> 08:26.339
Let's go to the infirmary
 and I'll take a look
 at your leg wound.

08:26.373 --> 08:28.475
There is no leg wound.

08:28.508 --> 08:31.712
That's what I was
 coming by to tell you.

08:31.745 --> 08:33.179
It's almost
 completely healed.

08:33.914 --> 08:35.282
How is that possible?

08:36.850 --> 08:38.852
I don't know.

09:09.950 --> 09:12.753
BRODY: We'd cover
 a lot more ground
 if we split up.

09:12.786 --> 09:14.622
You heard the colonel.
 "Proceed with caution."

09:14.655 --> 09:16.890
We are not splitting up.

09:16.924 --> 09:19.893
Fine. Then let's
 at least turn the Kino
 on search mode.

09:21.428 --> 09:22.630
Yeah, knock yourself out.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.914
GLORIA: A fascinating
 bit of information.

09:42.415 --> 09:46.319
Of course you know
 what this means.

09:46.353 --> 09:48.455
We may have a way
 of getting home.

09:50.457 --> 09:53.360
But you're not going to
 tell them that, are you?

09:55.763 --> 09:58.498
Well, I'm sure
 they'll figure it out
 on their own.

09:58.531 --> 10:00.768
And if they don't?

10:19.887 --> 10:23.857
GREER: Well, well, well.
 What do we have here?

10:23.891 --> 10:26.794
Ship's control center,
 I'm guessing.

10:26.827 --> 10:29.797
Huh. And I was gonna go
with rec room.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.672
(SYSTEM POWERING UP)

10:40.340 --> 10:41.641
Hey, what did
 the colonel say?

10:41.675 --> 10:44.411
He said,
 "You've got two hours.
 Make it fast."

10:45.879 --> 10:46.847
Colonel, this is Scott.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.616
Go ahead.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.885
We've found
 what appears to be
 the ship's control center.

10:51.919 --> 10:54.855
Brody and Dr. Volker
 are bringing systems
 online for study.

10:54.888 --> 10:57.524
Keep me updated.
 Where the hell were you?

10:57.557 --> 10:58.959
I stopped by the mess.

10:58.992 --> 10:59.893
Well, I tried
 radioing you.

10:59.927 --> 11:00.828
Yeah, I know.

11:05.098 --> 11:05.999
Everett, can I talk
 to you for a second?

11:08.035 --> 11:09.336
Sure.

11:12.439 --> 11:14.007
You sent a team over?
 Yeah.

11:14.041 --> 11:15.843
Without bothering
 to run it by me?

11:15.876 --> 11:18.511
Last time I checked,
 I was the commanding
 officer of this ship.

11:18.545 --> 11:19.980
I'm not disputing that...
 Meaning, I don't have to run

11:20.013 --> 11:22.015
anything by you
 or anyone else,
 for that matter.

11:22.049 --> 11:23.751
Look, I don't have
 a problem with
 sending a team over.

11:23.784 --> 11:26.920
I'd just appreciate
being kept in the loop.
Let me help.

11:26.954 --> 11:30.357
I don't need your help.

11:30.390 --> 11:31.825
Like hell you don't.
 David...

11:31.859 --> 11:33.593
Damn it, Everett...

11:36.029 --> 11:37.765
You've been
 going this alone
 since the incursion,

11:37.798 --> 11:40.033
and it's been
taking a toll.

11:40.067 --> 11:43.070
When are you going to
realize that this isn't
just about you?

11:43.103 --> 11:45.505
You have a responsibility
 to the people on board
 this ship

11:45.538 --> 11:47.574
and lately,
 you haven't been
 up to the task.

11:47.607 --> 11:49.877
Now you either shape up
 or step back.

11:52.880 --> 11:56.549
You're tired, I get it.
Let me help.

 son of a bitch.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.688
Hey, you saved my life.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.123
I had to kill you
 to do it.

12:03.156 --> 12:06.894
And I'm willing to do
 the same for you.

12:06.927 --> 12:10.097
Okay. They've found
 what looks to be
 the ship's control center

12:10.130 --> 12:11.865
and they're bringing
 systems online.

12:11.899 --> 12:13.767
What's the game plan?

12:13.801 --> 12:16.770
The game plan
 is just get as much
 information as we can

12:16.804 --> 12:18.438
before our time runs out.

12:20.140 --> 12:22.910
(SYSTEM WHIRRING)

12:52.806 --> 12:55.442

 we've docked
 with a seed ship.

12:56.676 --> 12:57.777
That's right.

12:57.811 --> 12:59.079
I'd like to
 offer my help.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.914
I have some understanding
 of Ancient technology...

13:00.948 --> 13:02.515
No, thank you.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.617
But I can be of
 some assistance...
 I said no.

13:04.651 --> 13:06.954
I'm not letting you
 or your people
 anywhere near that ship.

13:09.056 --> 13:10.657
You wanted
 to see me?

13:12.826 --> 13:15.162
I want to know how long
you plan on keeping us
locked up?

13:15.195 --> 13:16.830
I didn't really
 have a plan.

13:16.864 --> 13:20.633
I just thought
 I'd play it by ear,
 see how things go.

13:20.667 --> 13:23.270
We've been cooperative
 with your Homeworld Command,

13:23.303 --> 13:25.939
providing them
 with information on
 the Alliance as requested.

13:25.973 --> 13:27.841
You had no choice.

13:27.875 --> 13:30.878
It was either that
 or get left behind on
 some god-forsaken planet.

13:30.911 --> 13:33.613
We took down Dannic
 and gave you back
 control of this ship.

13:33.646 --> 13:34.848
To save your own lives.

13:34.882 --> 13:36.783

 the only ones at risk,

13:36.816 --> 13:39.719

I stepped in and
prevented the execution

13:39.752 --> 13:43.623
of all military personnel
 aboard Destiny,
 including you.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.792
I think we were
 better use to you alive.

But for what it's worth,
 I thank you.

13:47.760 --> 13:49.662

We can't spend the rest
of our days here on

13:53.666 --> 13:55.969
Should've thought about that
 before you attacked us.

13:56.003 --> 13:59.806
The way I see it,
 it could've gotten a hell
 of a lot worse for you.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.741
Colonel,
 just tell me,

14:01.774 --> 14:03.710
what do we have to do
 to earn our freedom?

14:03.743 --> 14:05.012
Prove to me that
 you're not a threat.

14:05.045 --> 14:06.313
And how do we do that?

14:06.346 --> 14:07.714
I don't think you can.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.920
I'm not your enemy anymore.
Neither are my people!

14:12.953 --> 14:14.854

 so making any progress?

 Sergeant Greer and I

14:37.710 --> 14:38.878

 a little look around.

 this right?

 my guess would be no.

 these power readings.

YOUNG: It was you,
 wasn't it?

15:14.114 --> 15:16.950
You're the one
 who told the prisoners
 about the seed ship?

15:16.984 --> 15:20.787
Any major developments
aboard Destiny concern
 them as well.

They had a right to know.

15:22.155 --> 15:24.091
Oh, damn it, Camile,
they're prisoners.
They don't have any rights.

15:24.124 --> 15:25.292
Oh, I can't believe
 what I'm hearing.

15:25.325 --> 15:27.727
They attacked the ship,
they threatened us.

15:27.760 --> 15:28.962
And now we have
 to live with them.

15:28.996 --> 15:31.898
No, we don't.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.066
We already got rid
 of most of them.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.135
There's only
 a handful left.

15:35.168 --> 15:37.304
Homeworld Command needs
 the intel they're providing,

15:37.337 --> 15:40.807
and in exchange
 for that information,
 they made a deal.

15:40.840 --> 15:43.110
That Homeworld Command
 doesn't have to live with,
 but we do.

15:43.143 --> 15:47.314
Then all the more reason
 we should be showing
 these people some respect.

15:47.347 --> 15:51.018
You know, if you would
 just take the time
 to get to know them,

15:51.051 --> 15:53.853
you'd realize that many
 of them didn't have a choice
 but to join the Alliance.

15:53.886 --> 15:55.855
You know what,
 I don't care.

15:55.888 --> 15:58.758
And I'm going to be damned
 if I risk the health
 and welfare of people

15:58.791 --> 16:00.293
aboard this ship
 on marching orders

16:00.327 --> 16:02.262
from the other side
 of the universe.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.364
And what about
 the people back home?

16:04.397 --> 16:06.333
Are you willing to
 risk their lives instead?

16:06.366 --> 16:10.770
Because that's what's
 going to happen if you
 renege on this deal.

16:10.803 --> 16:13.640
Homeworld Command
 has received confirmation

16:13.673 --> 16:16.643
that the Lucian Alliance
 is planning an attack
 on Earth,

16:16.676 --> 16:19.179
and it's quite possible
 that these prisoners
 have information

16:19.212 --> 16:20.980
that could help
 head off that attack.

16:21.881 --> 16:23.183
Or they could be lying.

16:23.216 --> 16:25.152
Yes, sure,
 they could be,

16:25.185 --> 16:27.854
but are you really willing
 to take that chance?

16:30.057 --> 16:33.126
Look, I understand.
 These last few days
 have been hard on you.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.228
Camile, do me a favor.

16:35.262 --> 16:38.998
Just watch what you say
to the prisoners.

16:39.032 --> 16:43.836
We're planning a service
 for Sergeant Riley
 later this week.

16:43.870 --> 16:46.939
I thought maybe
 you'd want to say
 a few words.

16:48.408 --> 16:49.876
Of course.

16:54.281 --> 16:57.484
So come on.
 Chen? Ramirez?

16:57.517 --> 17:01.121
That redheaded
civilian contractor
with the... Park.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.824
Park?

17:04.857 --> 17:09.329
Yeah. Remember
 that hamstring injury
 I said I got doing squats?

17:09.362 --> 17:10.896
Yeah.

17:13.133 --> 17:15.234
It wasn't doing squats.

17:21.973 --> 17:23.776
You wanted to see me?

17:23.810 --> 17:26.246
We checked, we re-checked,
 and re-re-checked
 just to be sure...

17:26.279 --> 17:28.848
The seed ship has
 sizable energy reserves.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.517
How sizable?

17:30.550 --> 17:32.885
With the output of
 both capacitors in play,

17:32.919 --> 17:35.021
enough to power the gate
 and get us home.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.356
In order for that
 to happen,

17:36.389 --> 17:39.759
I have to alter certain
conduits to open up
a transfer channel,

17:39.792 --> 17:40.860
but that's not something
 I can do from here.

17:40.893 --> 17:41.994
Go.

17:56.809 --> 17:58.878
What was that?
 PARK: What?

17:58.911 --> 18:00.947
We just lost
 the Kino feed.

18:03.250 --> 18:04.851
Ready, Eli.

18:07.154 --> 18:08.455
Eli?

18:08.488 --> 18:11.991
Yeah. Right. Right.

18:15.295 --> 18:16.796
(DOOR UNLOCKS)

18:21.534 --> 18:25.104
Dr. Rush, perfect timing.
 You're going to want
 to see this.

18:26.506 --> 18:29.075
Okay, back in a flash.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.478
Uh-huh. Wait. No,
 where are you going?

18:31.511 --> 18:34.080
Looks like
there's a malfunctioning
relay station one floor up.

18:34.113 --> 18:37.116
I'm gonna see if I can
 fix it, bring up that
 dead console.

18:55.202 --> 18:57.270
I'll warn you,
 Lieutenant,

18:57.304 --> 19:00.540
I tend to find surprises
particularly underwhelming.

19:00.573 --> 19:03.176
Not this one, you won't.
 Trust me.

19:09.916 --> 19:11.918
Pretty darn cool, huh?

19:19.892 --> 19:23.129
Yes. Of course.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.997
This is where the stargates
were manufactured

19:25.031 --> 19:28.034
before being transported
 to the various planets.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.103
Okay. Is that it?

19:32.939 --> 19:34.507
Yeah, that's it.

19:34.541 --> 19:36.343
Well, now we're done
 with this little diversion,

19:36.376 --> 19:37.944
could you escort me
 to the Control Room?

19:40.213 --> 19:41.414
(CHUCKLES)

19:49.689 --> 19:51.691
Didn't take you long,
 but there's still
 more that...

19:55.562 --> 19:58.097
Oh, my God.

19:58.130 --> 20:00.567
I don't... I don't...
 Please.

20:04.437 --> 20:07.440
What the hell?

20:07.474 --> 20:10.176
If you're not careful,
 that cut's going to
 open back up again.

20:10.209 --> 20:13.212
I can't help it.
 I like to play rough.

20:14.547 --> 20:15.915
How about you?

20:16.383 --> 20:17.517
(GRUNTS)

20:17.550 --> 20:22.121
I got it.
Yeah, I do.

 this is Volker.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.279
Go ahead.

20:46.313 --> 20:49.148
You might want to come back
 to the Control Room.

20:49.181 --> 20:50.717
You find something
 interesting?

20:50.750 --> 20:53.953
Well, yeah, actually.
 Something interesting
 found me.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.665
JOHANSEN: Have a seat.
 I'd like to take a look
 at your wound.

21:10.036 --> 21:12.071
Looks like it's
 healing nicely.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.940
Too bad. I was kind of
 hoping for a manly scar.

21:17.143 --> 21:18.378
I'm sorry.

21:20.380 --> 21:21.948
I'm sorry your child
 couldn't be saved.

21:28.455 --> 21:30.490
It's difficult to lose
 someone you love.
 I know.

21:33.059 --> 21:36.095
My wife, Anthea,
 three years ago.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.530
She was on her way
 back from the market,

21:37.564 --> 21:39.699
when she was caught
in a rainstorm.

21:39.732 --> 21:43.135
She ended up taking
 refuge in a shelter.

21:43.169 --> 21:45.672
It collapsed,
killing her
and six others.

21:46.473 --> 21:48.975
I'm sorry.

21:49.008 --> 21:51.310
She never liked me
 being in the Alliance.

21:51.344 --> 21:52.712
She thought
 it was too dangerous.

21:55.014 --> 21:56.683
I risked my life
 time and again,

21:56.716 --> 21:59.185
survived missions
 that should have
 killed me,

21:59.218 --> 22:02.455
and yet she dies
 doing something

22:02.489 --> 22:04.323
as mundane as
getting caught
in the rain.

22:05.157 --> 22:06.993
You felt guilty.

22:07.026 --> 22:09.729
Guilty. Angry.
 Despondent.

22:11.764 --> 22:14.734
I was miserable,
 until I came to
 an understanding.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.003
And what was that?

22:18.671 --> 22:20.440
That life is loss.

Grab your med kit
 and meet me at the airlock.

22:33.453 --> 22:35.522
You're heading over
 to the seed ship.

22:35.555 --> 22:39.158
Is anyone hurt?
 Not exactly.

22:39.191 --> 22:42.662
According to Scott,
 the alien is alive
 but unresponsive.

22:42.695 --> 22:43.830
How'd it even
 get on the ship?

22:43.863 --> 22:45.565
No idea.

22:45.598 --> 22:47.500
Okay. I'll do my best.

22:47.534 --> 22:49.502
You sure you don't
 want me to use the stones,
 bring someone else in?

22:49.536 --> 22:51.337
No. Sir,
 I want to do this.

No.

Yeah. No, I've got
 a piece of dried fruit

 That stuff's horrible.

What's rambutan?

25:24.724 --> 25:26.759
Just give it here.

Mmm. Good.

 it may be wise to find out
 whether or not it came alone.

30:45.111 --> 30:48.915
The seed ship has
begun drawing power
away from Destiny.

30:49.681 --> 30:51.017
Dr. Rush?

30:55.955 --> 30:57.789
Colonel Young,
 we just lost contact
 with Rush.

31:01.961 --> 31:04.796
Dunning.
Dunning, are you there?

31:06.899 --> 31:09.168
David, I need you to go
 to the Control Room

31:09.201 --> 31:12.004
and find out why Rush
 isn't responding.

31:12.038 --> 31:13.739
We're already
 on our way.

31:13.772 --> 31:16.208
T.J., Marsden, and the
 science team are headed back
 to Destiny with the alien.

31:16.242 --> 31:17.944
Have you found
 any more?

31:17.977 --> 31:19.278
TELFORD: Not yet.

31:20.612 --> 31:22.348
YOUNG: Talk to me, Eli.

31:22.381 --> 31:26.085
The seed ship is still
 drawing power away
 from Destiny.

31:26.118 --> 31:28.354
When the reserves are gone,
 there's no getting them back.

31:28.387 --> 31:31.023
Pretty soon, we won't even
 be able to make an FTL jump.

31:31.057 --> 31:32.091
So we can't stop it?

31:32.124 --> 31:34.026
We're trying,
 but nothing's working.

31:34.060 --> 31:36.228
What if we disconnect
 from the seed ship?

31:36.262 --> 31:38.197
Yeah, that would sever
 the power flow.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.933
Unfortunately,
we have no idea
how to do that.

31:40.967 --> 31:42.168
We've got to learn.
We've got to learn fast.

31:58.350 --> 32:01.387
Colonel, this is T.J.
 We lost the alien.

32:01.420 --> 32:02.754
Copy that.

32:10.762 --> 32:12.098
Check them.

32:19.105 --> 32:20.306
GREER:
 He's still breathing.

32:21.707 --> 32:22.808
YOUNG ON RADIO: David.

32:24.943 --> 32:27.079
We've found Rush and Dunning.
 They're unconscious.

32:27.113 --> 32:29.915
It doesn't look like
 we'll be able to stop
 the power transfer,

32:29.948 --> 32:32.651
so our only option
 is to sever the link
 between the two ships.

32:32.684 --> 32:35.354
We need you back here
 in order to disconnect.

32:38.991 --> 32:40.692
Negative.

32:42.361 --> 32:43.862
This is our one shot
 at getting home.

32:43.895 --> 32:46.265
There's got to be a way
 to reverse the transfer.

32:46.298 --> 32:48.634
Eli's tried
 and come up short.
 Listen to me, David.

32:48.667 --> 32:50.702
I want nothing more
 than to get everyone
 back home,

32:50.736 --> 32:53.005
but I'm not willing to risk
 anyone's life to do it.

32:55.307 --> 32:56.242
Put Eli on.

32:58.410 --> 32:59.678
Go on.

33:02.248 --> 33:04.350
Colonel?

33:04.383 --> 33:05.984
Is there a way to
 reverse the transfer
 from my end?

33:09.321 --> 33:10.789
Eli?

33:10.822 --> 33:12.824
Theoretically, yeah.
 Yeah, it's possible.

33:12.858 --> 33:15.127
Tell me what to do.

33:15.161 --> 33:18.664
You need to find anything
 that resembles a schematic

33:18.697 --> 33:21.200
or an active display,
 possibly indicative
 of the power transfer.

33:23.169 --> 33:26.805
Greer, Scott,
get those two
back to safety.

33:26.838 --> 33:30.342
Sir, those aliens are
 probably responsible
 for what's happened.

33:30.376 --> 33:32.010
If they come back here,
you will...
 Go.

33:33.345 --> 33:34.846
Go!

33:37.349 --> 33:38.917
(DEVICE BLEEPS)

33:38.950 --> 33:41.153
All right, I got it.

33:41.187 --> 33:43.855
ELI: Okay, now,
 I'm going to walk
 you through this.

33:43.889 --> 33:45.091
Forget walking.
 Let's sprint.

33:45.124 --> 33:47.993
I've got a basic knowledge
 of Ancient systems.

33:48.026 --> 33:50.196
Okay, you need
 to access the ship's
 distribution network.

33:54.933 --> 33:55.867
How are we doing
 for time?

33:58.270 --> 34:00.872
PARK: Once we hit red,
 we're at the point
 of no return.

34:00.906 --> 34:02.208
We have less than
 15 minutes.

34:20.891 --> 34:22.393
(DOOR BANGS SHUT)

34:29.168 --> 34:30.735
We're locked out.

34:35.341 --> 34:36.742
Wake up.

34:38.844 --> 34:40.946
What the hell?

34:40.978 --> 34:43.282
SCOTT: Forget it.
 Keep moving.

34:43.315 --> 34:44.315
(GRUNTS)

34:51.357 --> 34:53.125
(DEVICE BLEEPS)

34:53.159 --> 34:55.226
Eli, I'm done.
 What's next?

34:55.261 --> 34:57.496
Now you need to open
 a secondary conduit.

35:06.272 --> 35:08.039
BECKER:
 It's not budging.

35:22.488 --> 35:25.357
It's no use. We are cut off
from the Control Room.
Fall back.

35:25.391 --> 35:27.326
All right,
you guys heard the man.
Let's fall back.

35:33.131 --> 35:35.434
PARK:
 Less than six minutes.

35:35.467 --> 35:36.835
Are we any closer to finding
 a way to disconnect
 from the seed ship?

35:38.470 --> 35:39.371
We need Rush.

35:40.138 --> 35:40.972
Eli.

35:44.976 --> 35:47.513
Lieutenant Scott.
 Come in. We need Rush
 in the Control Room now.

35:48.347 --> 35:49.881
Dr. Rush?

35:52.484 --> 35:54.453
He is gone, sir.

35:54.486 --> 35:56.288
He's gone where?

35:56.322 --> 35:59.458
I don't know.
 Find him.

35:59.491 --> 36:04.296
Look, there's no way
 we're going to figure out
 how to disconnect in time.

36:04.330 --> 36:06.164
It's all up to
 Colonel Telford.

36:06.198 --> 36:07.933
Less than four minutes.

36:09.935 --> 36:10.869
David, how's it coming?

36:16.242 --> 36:17.343
Almost there.

36:18.910 --> 36:20.512
Okay. Next?

36:20.546 --> 36:22.981
Okay, now, all you have to do
 is override the power relay

36:23.014 --> 36:25.016
and just re-route it
 back through the channel
 you've just created.

36:29.455 --> 36:31.022
Three minutes.

36:36.528 --> 36:38.029
Almost there.

36:39.531 --> 36:41.032
(RUMBLING)

36:41.900 --> 36:42.901
(POWER SURGING)

36:54.145 --> 36:56.515
What was that?
 YOUNG: No idea.

36:56.548 --> 36:58.517
Eli?
 We just disconnected
 from the seed ship.

36:58.550 --> 37:00.286
Wait a minute.
 I thought you said...

37:00.319 --> 37:01.953
I didn't.

37:03.289 --> 37:04.390
It wasn't me.

37:05.657 --> 37:06.892
Well, then, how?

37:08.394 --> 37:09.395
How?

37:29.281 --> 37:31.283
I had no choice.

37:31.317 --> 37:34.152
In order to save the crew?

37:34.185 --> 37:36.254
Or did you do it
 to save your dream?

37:37.489 --> 37:39.257
Which was it, Nicholas?

37:55.507 --> 37:58.109
David, we just
 disconnected
 from the seed ship

37:58.143 --> 38:01.380
and we're about
 to jump into FTL.
 I'm sorry.

38:09.555 --> 38:11.122
Can't blame me
 for trying, right?

38:12.391 --> 38:14.460
Yeah. Yeah.

38:30.542 --> 38:32.310
Take care of those people.

38:36.482 --> 38:37.983
And Everett,

38:39.217 --> 38:41.052
take care of yourself.

39:09.381 --> 39:10.549
Everett?

39:12.518 --> 39:13.685

39:54.660 --> 39:55.761
(DOOR UNLOCKING)

40:07.739 --> 40:11.643
I understand that you made
 saving me a priority
 after I was shot.

40:12.678 --> 40:14.580
You didn't have to.

40:14.613 --> 40:15.814
Of course I did.

40:17.749 --> 40:19.250
Anyways, thank you.

 it feels so real

 going through

 spent saving for it

* Come so far, yeah

41:55.413 --> 42:00.752
* So just let me know
 when we get there

42:01.853 --> 42:04.856
