00:19.728 --> 00:21.021
<i>They took her.</i>

00:23.857 --> 00:25.358
<i>Jess, can you hear me?</i>

00:37.704 --> 00:38.872
<i>Please.</i>

00:38.955 --> 00:41.624
<i>Please find me. Please help.</i>

00:43.293 --> 00:45.045
<i>No! Get off me!</i>

00:45.128 --> 00:47.672
-<i> You're gonna be fine.</i>
<i>-Get the fuck off me!</i>

01:31.549 --> 01:33.093
I got tapes!

01:33.176 --> 01:35.303
Come get your tapes! Cassette tapes!

01:41.601 --> 01:43.103
I got tapes!

01:43.186 --> 01:44.395
Come get your tapes!

01:45.021 --> 01:47.232
Any one… Any of those…
That's the one-dollar box.

01:47.315 --> 01:48.775
Anything in there is one dollar.

01:48.858 --> 01:50.944
The box too.
Want the box? That's a dollar too.

01:51.027 --> 01:52.195
Tape… Tape?

01:52.278 --> 01:54.572
I don't know what you need.

01:54.656 --> 01:56.491
-Hey, what's going on, Dan?
-Hey, man.

01:57.075 --> 01:59.786
Picked these up
at a storage-space auction last week.

01:59.869 --> 02:02.997
You got first crack at these, man.
Unseen. Ten bucks a pop.

02:03.081 --> 02:06.167
You know last month you sold me
16 hours' worth of a T-ball tournament?

02:06.251 --> 02:07.961
Yeah? Yeah.

02:08.044 --> 02:12.549
But also, I sold you an uncut version
of <i>Phantasmagoria</i> off channel 7.

02:12.632 --> 02:14.759
That's unreleased and very rare.

02:14.843 --> 02:18.346
I just think you need to get yourself
a VCR so you know what you're selling.

02:18.429 --> 02:20.306
Yeah, where's the fun in that?

02:20.390 --> 02:21.850
Look, five bucks a pop.

02:21.933 --> 02:24.018
If they're shitty,
I'll give you store credit.

02:24.602 --> 02:26.354
Look, I know you love the hunt.

02:28.439 --> 02:29.482
All right.

02:30.108 --> 02:31.234
All right.

02:32.610 --> 02:34.195
My man.

02:34.279 --> 02:37.073
Hey, Jill stopped by earlier,
said to tell you hello.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.033
-What, this morning?
-Yeah.

02:39.117 --> 02:41.619
She picked up some books
from a haul last weekend.

02:41.703 --> 02:43.955
Might be able to catch her
if you, uh, head that way.

02:44.038 --> 02:45.832
She's just going back to the shop.

02:46.791 --> 02:48.459
You guys are still friendly, right?

02:48.543 --> 02:50.086
All right. See you, man.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.005
Hey, let me know what's on those.

02:53.673 --> 02:55.175
I got tapes!

02:55.258 --> 02:56.718
VHS tapes!

02:57.218 --> 02:58.553
Cassette tapes!

03:03.641 --> 03:06.644
I got a couple of 16mm projectors
coming in next week

03:06.728 --> 03:08.188
if you're still looking.

03:08.271 --> 03:11.900
And we just got in two reels
of <i>Flash Gordon,</i> 1940.

03:11.983 --> 03:13.151
Good condition.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.862
I'll have the museum call you.

03:38.509 --> 03:42.597
<i>Dan, it's Evie Crest.</i>
<i>The package should've arrived today.</i>

03:42.680 --> 03:44.224
<i>The footage is in terrible shape.</i>

03:44.307 --> 03:46.476
<i>Let me know</i>
<i>if you can do anything with it.</i>

04:39.904 --> 04:41.114
What is it?

04:41.197 --> 04:42.156
<i>The Circle.</i>

04:42.240 --> 04:44.242
A horror anthology, 1958.

04:44.909 --> 04:47.161
Sort of like a pre-<i>Twilight Zone</i>
kind of thing.

04:47.245 --> 04:49.414
-I've never heard of it.
-That's because it never aired.

04:49.497 --> 04:51.749
William Crest died
and all the tapes disappeared.

04:51.833 --> 04:56.212
"Crest." Oh, um, that's that
<i>Robinson Crusoe</i> guy, right?

04:56.296 --> 04:59.674
He made all those movies
in the '30s with Brenda Joyce.

04:59.757 --> 05:02.552
-I used to love those movies as a kid.
-Yeah, so did my dad.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.097
Anyway, uh, two months ago,

05:06.180 --> 05:09.559
his daughter Evie found a box of tapes
buried somewhere on his estate

05:09.642 --> 05:10.768
and now here we are.

05:11.269 --> 05:13.646
-Ooh. Some creepy shit.
-Mm.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.982
Well, maybe
the museum will issue a set

05:16.065 --> 05:17.775
and you can write the companion guide.

05:17.859 --> 05:19.986
Get a little glory for all that talent.

05:20.069 --> 05:23.656
I kind of just wanted to give Evie
a little piece of her father back.

05:25.867 --> 05:27.201
Oh, um…

05:28.828 --> 05:30.330
-From Karen.
-What's this?

05:31.331 --> 05:32.290
No idea.

06:22.799 --> 06:23.758
<i>Are you ready?</i>

06:23.841 --> 06:26.094
<i>That's what</i>
<i>the little red light means, Mel.</i>

06:26.177 --> 06:28.221
<i>Okay.</i>

06:29.430 --> 06:30.807
<i>I'm Melody Pendras,</i>

06:30.890 --> 06:35.019
<i>doctoral candidate</i>
<i>in sociocultural anthropology at NYU.</i>

06:35.603 --> 06:40.733
<i>My upcoming research project will examine</i>
<i>a small New York City community,</i>

06:40.817 --> 06:44.404
<i>residents of the Visser apartment building</i>
<i>in the East Village,</i>

06:44.487 --> 06:49.242
<i>as individuals adapt to cultural shifts</i>
<i>at the end of the 20th century.</i>

06:51.994 --> 06:54.664
<i>They'll talk to me, right?</i>

06:54.747 --> 06:58.418
<i>Oh God, no.</i>
<i>No, no, no, they'll spit gum in your hair</i>

06:58.501 --> 07:00.878
<i>and shove spiders under your door.</i>

07:01.546 --> 07:03.172
<i>Yes, they'll talk to you.</i>

07:03.256 --> 07:05.133
<i>Everybody talks to you. It's…</i>

07:06.426 --> 07:07.802
<i>Maybe I should come with you.</i>

07:07.885 --> 07:09.512
<i>You know, for protection.</i>

07:10.138 --> 07:11.264
<i>From what?</i>

07:11.347 --> 07:12.390
<i>I don't know.</i>

07:12.473 --> 07:17.520
<i>Handsy old creeps, sewer rats, vampires.</i>

07:18.646 --> 07:20.440
<i>What if you find a new best friend?</i>

07:21.482 --> 07:22.442
<i>I won't.</i>

07:22.525 --> 07:24.944
<i>Actually sounds pretty fucking boring.</i>
<i>No offense.</i>

07:26.070 --> 07:27.655
<i>It's for my dissertation.</i>

07:27.738 --> 07:29.907
<i>Fine. Leave me.</i>

07:31.492 --> 07:33.161
<i>I'm not going very far.</i>

07:33.995 --> 07:36.164
<i>I'll be back before you can even miss me.</i>

07:36.747 --> 07:39.876
<i>That's what Amelia Earhart said. And--</i>

07:39.959 --> 07:41.961
<i>No, she didn't.</i>
<i>-No.</i>

07:47.133 --> 07:48.634
<i>Wish me luck.</i>

07:48.718 --> 07:50.011
<i>You don't need luck.</i>

08:29.217 --> 08:32.261
<i>But in the middle of the park,</i>
<i>there was nothing.</i>

08:32.345 --> 08:34.972
No radio. No phonograph.

08:35.973 --> 08:39.143
Only the music coming
from seemingly nowhere.

08:40.144 --> 08:42.313
The song they had once shared.

08:42.396 --> 08:44.315
Edmond, are you out there?

08:47.443 --> 08:48.653
Is that you?

08:49.529 --> 08:51.739
Could Edmond, a city park worker,

08:51.822 --> 08:55.326
have unintentionally
crossed into another dimension?

09:01.290 --> 09:02.583
I'm Mark Higgins.

09:02.667 --> 09:06.337
This is <i>Mystery Signals:</i>
<i>True Tales of the Secret City.</i>

09:08.798 --> 09:11.050
<i>So, the guy's totally broke, okay?</i>

09:11.133 --> 09:14.136
So he buys his girlfriend, uh,
this vintage engagement ring

09:14.220 --> 09:16.973
from one of these
junk shops on the Lower East Side.

09:17.932 --> 09:21.143
Turns out, two days after he slides
that fucking thing on her finger,

09:21.227 --> 09:22.979
this girl loses her shit, okay?

09:23.062 --> 09:26.148
She says that she's seeing a woman
staring at her in the mirror.

09:27.191 --> 09:29.694
What? Fucking what?
The fucking ring is haunted, man.

09:29.777 --> 09:31.946
Yeah, I don't believe
that supernatural shit.

09:32.029 --> 09:34.407
That's right. I forgot. You don't believe.
Mr. Fucking Paranoid.

09:34.490 --> 09:36.617
Mr. Someone Might Be Watching Me.

09:37.493 --> 09:39.870
Uh, yeah, I got an early day. Sorry.

09:39.954 --> 09:43.499
The museum doesn't open till noon.
There's no such thing as an early day.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.459
-Next week, I promise.
-Hey.

09:47.420 --> 09:51.716
Look, you… you let me know
if you're feeling low again, all right?

09:51.799 --> 09:54.719
Seriously. No fucking bullshit this time.
You'll ask me for help?

09:55.386 --> 09:56.887
Yeah, I'll ask you for help.

09:59.557 --> 10:00.558
Okay.

10:01.809 --> 10:02.768
All right.

10:03.769 --> 10:05.563
Don't fuck with me.

10:10.568 --> 10:12.570
<i>Amazing work</i>
<i>on the Hi8 footage, Dan.</i>

10:12.653 --> 10:13.904
<i>Thanks for the quick turnaround.</i>

10:13.988 --> 10:15.281
Oh, sure thing.

10:15.364 --> 10:17.742
You know, it didn't
really seem like something

10:17.825 --> 10:19.243
the museum would be interested in.

10:19.327 --> 10:21.370
It was a favor for a big donor.

10:21.454 --> 10:25.124
He'd like you to come by his office today
to thank you in person.

10:51.192 --> 10:52.193
Dan!

10:53.152 --> 10:54.528
Great to meet you.

10:55.446 --> 10:56.656
Thanks for coming.

10:56.739 --> 10:58.157
No problem.

10:58.240 --> 11:02.745
Hey, Callie, can I, uh, get
an Arnold Palmer? Bring one for Dan too.

11:03.287 --> 11:04.246
Have a seat.

11:04.789 --> 11:05.665
Okay.

11:07.667 --> 11:11.212
Thanks for taking on
our little project last night.

11:11.295 --> 11:14.340
Karen said you were the best man around
to bring back lost things,

11:14.423 --> 11:15.633
and she was right.

11:15.716 --> 11:17.426
Well, she's my boss.

11:17.510 --> 11:18.844
Yeah.

11:18.928 --> 11:20.680
Right. Yeah.

11:21.806 --> 11:25.017
That's actually why
I asked you to stop by, Dan.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.311
I was wondering
if you might like to change that,

11:28.020 --> 11:29.814
might like to come work for LMG.

11:29.897 --> 11:31.524
Temporarily, of course.

11:32.441 --> 11:33.901
Well, I don't… Uh…

11:36.487 --> 11:37.488
Thank you.

11:38.823 --> 11:39.907
Um…

11:41.701 --> 11:44.120
What do you guys do exactly?

11:44.203 --> 11:45.955
Because I did a little research and--

11:46.038 --> 11:47.957
You couldn't find anything.

11:48.541 --> 11:49.542
Right.

11:49.625 --> 11:50.876
Makes us even.

11:51.460 --> 11:53.754
I couldn't find anything on you.

11:55.881 --> 11:59.468
Well, uh, I like my privacy.

11:59.552 --> 12:02.096
I respect that.
We like our privacy too.

12:03.055 --> 12:04.390
Here's the thing, Dan.

12:05.307 --> 12:07.393
We're looking for an artist.

12:08.602 --> 12:11.522
Someone who can restore
a recently acquired collection

12:11.605 --> 12:13.065
of damaged video tapes.

12:13.149 --> 12:15.151
Well, what kind of damage?

12:15.234 --> 12:16.277
Fire damage.

12:16.360 --> 12:18.070
Smoke, soot, water.

12:18.154 --> 12:21.115
The fragment you digitized
is part of the collection.

12:21.991 --> 12:23.993
The fire at the Visser building, right?

12:24.076 --> 12:25.119
That's right.

12:25.911 --> 12:27.747
In any case, the contents of the tapes

12:27.830 --> 12:30.791
would need to be kept confidential
for legal purposes.

12:31.459 --> 12:33.753
The fee would be
a hundred thousand dollars.

12:35.171 --> 12:37.214
-Wow.
-There's just one hitch.

12:37.298 --> 12:39.717
Because the materials are so fragile
they can't be moved.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.762
So you'd be doing the work
at our remote research facility

12:42.845 --> 12:43.763
in the Catskills.

12:45.473 --> 12:47.016
It's beautiful up there.

12:47.099 --> 12:49.226
Not a bad place to be all alone.

12:51.145 --> 12:52.646
Right. Uh…

12:53.189 --> 12:55.024
Before you say no, Dan,

12:55.107 --> 12:57.568
here's why I think you're our guy.

12:59.361 --> 13:00.780
Creating this archive,

13:00.863 --> 13:02.656
putting this puzzle together,

13:02.740 --> 13:05.201
finding out what happened at the Visser,

13:05.284 --> 13:08.370
it would mean the world
to everyone who lost someone in that fire.

13:08.454 --> 13:10.456
And I know you have a…

13:11.665 --> 13:14.084
special understanding
of a situation like that.

13:16.295 --> 13:17.296
Sorry?

13:18.756 --> 13:21.091
You lost your family in a fire,
isn't that right?

13:23.344 --> 13:26.931
And it seems you've spent your life trying
to bring lost things back to people.

13:27.014 --> 13:28.599
Sorry, I have to get back to work.

13:29.391 --> 13:31.268
I'm sorry, Dan. Truly, I didn't mean to--

13:31.352 --> 13:33.145
I'm sorry for wasting your time.

13:33.229 --> 13:35.898
Not at all, Dan. Not… not at all.

13:35.981 --> 13:38.150
Let us know if you change your mind.

13:42.071 --> 13:44.156
<i> How the fuck</i>
<i>would he find out about my family?</i>

13:44.240 --> 13:45.741
<i>Have you heard of the internet?</i>

13:45.825 --> 13:48.911
Nope, it's not out there.
It's not public information. I've looked.

13:48.994 --> 13:50.454
<i> I'm kidding, okay?</i>

13:50.538 --> 13:54.416
<i>Look, come over. I'll take you out</i>
<i>for shitty Peking duck and vodka shots.</i>

13:54.500 --> 13:56.210
<i>Yeah, okay, I'll call you later.</i>

14:59.189 --> 15:01.483
<i>-That's what the little red light--</i>
<i>-…ody Pendras.</i>

15:01.567 --> 15:04.653
<i>No, no, no, they'll</i>
<i>spit gum in your hair and--</i>

15:40.314 --> 15:42.858
-You think this is your dog?
-Yes.

15:44.234 --> 15:45.235
Maybe.

15:46.195 --> 15:50.366
Okay, why would a random, hot grad student
be in a picture with your dog?

15:50.449 --> 15:51.408
I don't know.

15:57.831 --> 15:59.041
"Melody Pendras."

15:59.875 --> 16:03.003
-One of the tenants who died in the fire?
-Officially, no one died.

16:04.922 --> 16:06.423
Thirteen bodies never recovered.

16:07.341 --> 16:09.343
To me, that means they died.

16:10.761 --> 16:12.304
I don't know. I don't know, man.

16:12.388 --> 16:16.016
I looked her up
and I couldn't find anything about her.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.560
I even paid for
one of those people-finder sites.

16:18.644 --> 16:22.940
And the only thing I found
was a 98-year-old woman living in Orlando

16:23.023 --> 16:27.653
and some librarian
who died of typhoid fever in, what, 1923?

16:28.404 --> 16:29.530
Is this about Jill?

16:30.114 --> 16:30.948
What?

16:31.031 --> 16:32.950
Because, if you
want me to set you up, I can.

16:33.033 --> 16:34.618
You know that. Just say the word.

16:34.702 --> 16:37.705
I mean, remember that cute barista
who curates the anime festival?

16:39.873 --> 16:41.291
It's not about Jill.

16:41.375 --> 16:44.586
I saved up three weeks of allowance
to buy Cleo a red dog collar

16:44.670 --> 16:46.171
that looks just like this one.

16:48.424 --> 16:51.176
I just… I think you're
seeing something you want to see.

16:51.260 --> 16:55.431
Aren't you the guy that goes on stage
and tells stories about demon sex cults

16:55.514 --> 16:58.976
and time-traveling and pirate
radio stations from another dimension?

16:59.059 --> 17:01.812
Yes, but that's my podcast
and this is real life.

17:01.895 --> 17:03.939
Look, I did a little digging on LMG,

17:04.023 --> 17:06.150
I couldn't find
any public information about them.

17:06.233 --> 17:07.901
Okay? No logo, no media presence.

17:07.985 --> 17:10.320
For all we know,
they're building a Death Star.

17:10.404 --> 17:12.906
You want to help this Davenport guy
build a Death Star?

17:13.449 --> 17:16.618
Wouldn't you rather stay here,
help with the <i>Mystery Signals </i>spin-off?

17:16.702 --> 17:19.413
And what about that show
you've been fixing up, <i>The Circle?</i>

17:19.496 --> 17:21.457
You've been chasing
that thing for fucking forever.

17:21.540 --> 17:22.791
I have to take the job.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.334
This picture's a sign.

17:24.418 --> 17:25.794
-Of what?
-I don't know.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.880
You said I was seeing things
I wanted to see?

17:28.380 --> 17:30.090
Maybe it's time I take a better look.

17:40.392 --> 17:41.769
Beautiful country.

17:42.561 --> 17:43.729
Yeah.

17:43.812 --> 17:45.147
You and your family

17:45.731 --> 17:49.318
used to live in the Hudson River Valley
down in Westchester County, am I right?

17:52.029 --> 17:53.405
Background check.

18:36.698 --> 18:38.117
Your key to the kingdom.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.630
Rec room and living quarters
are downstairs.

18:51.713 --> 18:53.465
Little dated, but everything works.

18:54.633 --> 18:56.969
Fridge and freezer are fully stocked.

18:57.052 --> 18:58.887
Deliveries come once a week.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.056
Anything you like, sky's the limit.

19:02.099 --> 19:06.645
We bought this property in the late '80s
to use as a research campus.

19:07.688 --> 19:09.690
Mostly used for storage now.

19:10.357 --> 19:12.526
And special projects like this one.

19:14.903 --> 19:18.365
So, unlike the rec room,

19:18.448 --> 19:21.743
all the equipment and tools
in here are state-of-the-art.

19:22.369 --> 19:25.038
Unfortunately,
we don't have internet out here yet

19:25.122 --> 19:29.209
and cell service is rather spotty,
I'm afraid.

19:29.293 --> 19:30.711
We got a landline.

19:30.794 --> 19:31.962
Real dependable.

19:32.045 --> 19:34.381
You're welcome to make
as many calls as you like.

19:34.464 --> 19:36.091
Let me show you the archive.

19:46.226 --> 19:48.478
These are the tapes
you'll be working with.

19:48.562 --> 19:53.108
All the material recovered from
the Visser Apartments after the 1994 fire.

19:53.192 --> 19:57.529
This is the camera that was used
to record the footage.

19:57.613 --> 19:59.031
No reason you'll need it,

19:59.114 --> 20:02.659
but we thought it best
to keep everything together.

20:04.703 --> 20:09.458
Blank tapes and additional hard drives
are in the equipment room.

20:10.375 --> 20:13.795
Let us know if you need anything.
We'll get you everything you need.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.088
Any questions?

20:15.797 --> 20:16.798
Good.

20:19.593 --> 20:22.971
We really appreciate you
taking on this job, Dan,

20:23.055 --> 20:25.641
sharing your talents with us.

20:26.558 --> 20:27.517
Oh!

20:28.518 --> 20:29.728
One more thing.

20:36.276 --> 20:37.236
What…?

20:39.279 --> 20:41.281
You want to make sure I get my steps in?

20:41.365 --> 20:43.283
If you're ever in trouble,
press the button.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.994
We got medical professionals
less than 20 minutes away.

20:46.578 --> 20:48.705
That includes mental health too.

20:53.168 --> 20:54.711
Like I said, Dan,

20:55.837 --> 20:58.257
we did a thorough background check.

20:58.340 --> 21:00.175
We'd be negligent if we didn't.

21:00.259 --> 21:04.179
Yeah, I don't know,
maybe you might need a stool sample?

21:04.263 --> 21:05.264
Yeah?

21:05.847 --> 21:07.266
Or blood? Urine?

21:07.349 --> 21:11.270
I don't know, maybe you got a fucking
Rorschach test in the back there for me.

21:11.353 --> 21:13.814
-You got a clean bill of health, Dan.
-Right. Yeah.

21:13.897 --> 21:18.318
Your breakdown is in the rearview mirror
as far as we're concerned.

21:18.402 --> 21:21.488
I just want you to know that
we're here for you should you need us.

21:21.571 --> 21:22.864
Mm-hmm. Cool.

21:23.865 --> 21:25.659
-I'll leave you to it.
-Okay.

21:27.160 --> 21:28.161
Good luck.

21:28.787 --> 21:30.289
I'll be in touch.

22:59.920 --> 23:01.463
Curiosity killed the cat.

23:24.986 --> 23:26.488
<i>I'm Melody Pendras.</i>

23:26.571 --> 23:30.283
<i>It's March 11th, 1994, 10:32 a.m.</i>

23:30.367 --> 23:32.619
<i>This is day one</i>
<i>of the oral history project</i>

23:32.702 --> 23:34.371
<i>on the Visser apartment building.</i>

23:38.750 --> 23:41.503
According to the New York
Public Library archives,

23:41.586 --> 23:46.633
it was built in either 1932 or 1934,
architect unknown.

23:47.175 --> 23:51.555
Basically, it looks exactly like
a million other buildings in the city.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.143
<i>Oh, that's okay. Thanks.</i>

23:57.102 --> 24:00.397
<i>It was built on the ruins of a mansion</i>
<i>that burned down in the '20s.</i>

24:01.106 --> 24:03.817
<i>This is strange detail</i>
<i>for a building like this.</i>

24:07.737 --> 24:09.156
<i>Same thing here.</i>

24:13.034 --> 24:13.994
Are you Melody?

24:14.494 --> 24:15.495
That's me.

24:16.705 --> 24:17.998
You coming in or not?

24:25.338 --> 24:27.883
Mailboxes, community room.

24:27.966 --> 24:29.801
Sorry, elevator's out today.

24:33.972 --> 24:36.349
-Do you mind if I keep filming?
-Nah.

24:36.433 --> 24:39.060
Mom used to make me do
community theater when I was a kid.

24:41.688 --> 24:45.484
So, is "John Smith" a stage name?

24:45.567 --> 24:46.485
What?

24:46.568 --> 24:51.031
Oh, nothing. It's just one of those names
that almost sound made-up, you know?

24:51.573 --> 24:53.283
I'll tell my mom you said so.

24:56.828 --> 25:00.207
Bedroom through there,
bathroom through there, kitchen.

25:00.290 --> 25:02.876
Last tenant left some books and things.
If you don't want it,

25:02.959 --> 25:05.629
I can get someone from the church
to come take it for a rummage sale.

25:05.712 --> 25:07.923
It's fine. I don't have
much stuff of my own.

25:08.006 --> 25:10.467
This is the key to the building.

25:10.550 --> 25:12.844
This is a key to the front door.

25:12.928 --> 25:14.221
Any questions?

25:15.055 --> 25:18.141
Do you know there's a woman named
Julia Bennett who lives in the building?

25:18.225 --> 25:19.226
Or lived?

25:19.809 --> 25:22.270
Can't tell you that.
It's a violation of privacy laws.

25:22.354 --> 25:24.022
Of course. I was just wondering.

25:24.105 --> 25:25.732
It's just someone I lost touch with.

25:27.400 --> 25:28.985
That's the conclusion of the tour.

25:29.069 --> 25:31.029
Any comments or questions,
put 'em in writing.

25:31.112 --> 25:32.614
Do you have any advice?

25:34.699 --> 25:37.077
For getting to know people
in the building?

25:38.078 --> 25:39.746
<i>Stay away from the sixth floor.</i>

25:45.126 --> 25:47.379
<i> So, this is my apartment.</i>

25:49.548 --> 25:51.216
<i>Standard one-bedroom.</i>

25:52.342 --> 25:54.553
<i>I've actually never lived alone, so…</i>

25:59.432 --> 26:01.226
<i>Good luck to me, I guess.</i>

28:15.777 --> 28:16.695
Hello?

28:18.738 --> 28:19.656
Hello?

28:23.326 --> 28:24.285
<i>Hello?</i>

28:45.306 --> 28:47.851
<i>God. Get a grip, Melody.</i>

28:48.393 --> 28:49.352
<i>Jesus.</i>

28:55.233 --> 28:59.028
<i>It's March 12th, 1994, 9:04 a.m.</i>

28:59.112 --> 29:02.282
<i>This is day two at</i>
<i>the Visser apartment complex.</i>

29:02.824 --> 29:05.160
<i>I'm now gonna go knock on some doors.</i>

29:06.077 --> 29:07.287
<i>Wish me luck.</i>

29:18.631 --> 29:19.632
Hello?

29:21.634 --> 29:22.552
Hello?

29:23.303 --> 29:25.555
I'm Melody Pendras, your new neighbor.

29:25.638 --> 29:28.767
I'm doing a project on
the Visser Apartments for my dissertation.

29:28.850 --> 29:32.854
I was hoping you'd talk about the building
and the community who lives here.

29:46.075 --> 29:47.744
Hey, how are you? Here.

29:48.286 --> 29:50.830
-Here you go. Bye.
-Thank you. Have a good day.

29:57.295 --> 29:59.881
I'm Jess. I work for
a bunch of tenants in the building.

29:59.964 --> 30:03.384
Like, uh, get coffee,
walk dogs, buy newspapers,

30:03.468 --> 30:05.720
pick up Cool Ranch Doritos
or Preparation H,

30:05.804 --> 30:07.806
or Greek salads from Athens Tavern.

30:07.889 --> 30:09.891
I do laundry, I take out trash,

30:09.974 --> 30:11.935
get strollers and sleds out of storage…

30:12.727 --> 30:14.479
Anything you need, I can handle.

30:14.562 --> 30:16.815
So you know all the tenants
in the building.

30:16.898 --> 30:17.816
Mostly.

30:17.899 --> 30:21.069
I've lived here since I was born,
so they all know me.

30:21.152 --> 30:24.781
-Could you introduce me to some of them?
-Why? Can't make friends or something?

30:24.864 --> 30:26.366
I'm working on a project.

30:26.449 --> 30:30.537
It's an oral history of the building,
but I can't get anyone to open their door.

30:30.620 --> 30:32.872
-So I thought maybe--
-What's an oral history?

30:32.956 --> 30:36.334
A collection of historical information
about a group of people or a place

30:36.417 --> 30:38.795
that uses first-person interviews as data.

30:42.006 --> 30:45.677
People tell me their stories
and I record them with this.

30:46.386 --> 30:48.096
You wanna know about the Visser?

30:48.638 --> 30:50.348
And the people who live here.

30:51.808 --> 30:54.102
Well, I'm pretty booked.

30:54.185 --> 30:56.604
I could pay you. I don't have a lot, but--

30:56.688 --> 30:57.647
How much?

30:59.649 --> 31:01.192
Twenty-five a week?

31:04.487 --> 31:06.030
Who do you wanna meet first?

31:06.614 --> 31:09.117
<i>I'm Tamara Stefano.</i>

31:09.868 --> 31:11.703
<i>I was born</i>

31:11.786 --> 31:13.913
30-something years ago in Rome.

31:13.997 --> 31:16.207
I moved to New York when I was ten.

31:16.291 --> 31:18.042
How long have you lived at the Visser?

31:18.126 --> 31:20.128
I can't remember exactly.

31:20.712 --> 31:22.380
Six years, maybe.

31:23.590 --> 31:25.675
And what brought you to this building?

31:26.217 --> 31:29.387
I needed a place that
would fit this giant fucking piano.

31:30.513 --> 31:31.764
And the rent is really cheap.

31:31.848 --> 31:33.433
So you're a musician.

31:33.516 --> 31:34.434
Composer.

31:34.976 --> 31:36.686
Opera, mostly.

31:36.769 --> 31:38.897
Experimental stuff, not Puccini.

31:39.689 --> 31:42.066
I think I heard you
working on something last night.

31:42.150 --> 31:45.069
I was doing a show
at the Sanctuary last night.

31:45.153 --> 31:46.696
Must've been someone else.

31:48.448 --> 31:49.407
Here.

31:49.949 --> 31:51.743
This is what I'm working on right now.

31:58.416 --> 31:59.959
It's called "Purgatory."

32:04.714 --> 32:08.259
It's about a descent into a shadow world.

32:11.596 --> 32:15.224
This is the chorus of human suffering.

32:15.308 --> 32:17.810
When I stage it,
the performers wear those.

32:35.161 --> 32:36.412
This…

32:36.496 --> 32:38.289
Didn't I hear this last night?

32:49.884 --> 32:50.718
Hey.

32:51.761 --> 32:52.637
Yeah.

32:54.681 --> 32:55.723
Yeah.

33:22.500 --> 33:23.710
<i>Hey, are you okay?</i>

33:24.419 --> 33:25.294
<i>Yeah.</i>

33:26.045 --> 33:27.463
<i>Yeah, yeah, I just…</i>

33:29.924 --> 33:33.720
<i>Doesn't the music make you feel…?</i>

33:34.679 --> 33:37.640
<i>Hey, you need some soda</i>
<i>or a sandwich or something?</i>

33:38.725 --> 33:39.892
<i>Yeah.</i>

34:03.416 --> 34:05.334
<i>This is Mark Higgins with </i>Mystery Signals.

34:05.418 --> 34:06.878
<i>Please leave a detailed message</i>

34:06.961 --> 34:09.255
<i>and I'll return your call</i>
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

34:10.423 --> 34:12.967
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Uh, it's me.

34:13.051 --> 34:14.927
Um, I'm here.

34:16.554 --> 34:18.139
It's nice. Um…

34:18.639 --> 34:19.932
I guess.

34:20.016 --> 34:22.435
It's quiet, lots of trees. Um…

34:22.518 --> 34:24.395
But no internet.

34:24.479 --> 34:26.731
So I was hoping you could do me a favor.

34:26.814 --> 34:27.857
Uh…

34:27.940 --> 34:30.818
Could you look up a composer
named Tamara Stefano?

34:30.902 --> 34:33.654
I think I heard one of her songs before.

34:33.738 --> 34:35.948
I just can't remember where. Uh…

34:40.661 --> 34:41.537
Hello?

34:58.763 --> 34:59.931
Is someone there?

36:26.726 --> 36:27.977
<i> Hello?</i>

36:28.060 --> 36:29.812
<i> Dan, it's Virgil.</i>

36:31.105 --> 36:33.107
<i>Just calling to see</i>
<i>how you're settling in.</i>

36:33.191 --> 36:37.320
<i> Uh, fine, great, yeah.</i>
<i>I've already started working.</i>

36:39.864 --> 36:40.948
<i> Fantastic.</i>

36:41.991 --> 36:44.994
<i>Remember to eat and sleep.</i>
<i>No burning out. Clear?</i>

36:45.578 --> 36:46.662
<i>Sure.</i>

36:47.788 --> 36:50.333
<i>You let us know</i>
<i>if the mattress is too firm.</i>

36:50.416 --> 36:52.710
<i>I want you getting all the rest you need.</i>

37:33.834 --> 37:35.127
Fuck yeah, dude.

38:41.819 --> 38:42.778
<i>What is it?</i>

38:53.497 --> 38:54.790
What are you playing?

39:40.378 --> 39:44.507
I'm not a rat person,
but you can stay until your tail heals.

39:45.966 --> 39:47.927
<i>Sometimes I get low blood sugar too.</i>

39:48.010 --> 39:50.721
<i>But I don't get dizzy, I get mean.</i>

39:51.514 --> 39:54.975
<i>My Home Ec teacher actually keeps little</i>
<i>packs of raisins in her desk for me.</i>

39:55.059 --> 39:56.018
<i>Keep me sweet.</i>

39:59.188 --> 40:01.273
<i>Is this the interview?</i>

40:01.774 --> 40:02.858
<i>Did we start already?</i>

40:02.942 --> 40:04.693
<i>Uh, no. Sorry. Um…</i>

40:07.822 --> 40:09.782
<i>Okay, set.</i>

40:11.033 --> 40:14.453
So, tell me your name
and when you were born

40:14.537 --> 40:16.747
and how you came to live at the Visser.

40:17.248 --> 40:20.543
I'm Jessica Lewis and I'm a ninth grader
at East Village Community High.

40:20.626 --> 40:25.047
I was born March 8th, 1980,
at 4:21 in the afternoon.

40:26.549 --> 40:28.926
Right out there, in the east stairwell.

40:29.844 --> 40:30.970
Wait, seriously?

40:31.512 --> 40:32.596
Yeah.

40:32.680 --> 40:34.849
My mom went into labor six weeks early.

40:34.932 --> 40:38.686
The elevator was out, so she called a cab
and started walking down the stairs,

40:38.769 --> 40:41.772
but she didn't make it
all the way to the lobby.

40:41.856 --> 40:44.525
Holy shit. That is crazy.

40:47.820 --> 40:49.113
Do you think it's bad luck?

40:50.030 --> 40:50.865
What?

40:51.824 --> 40:53.576
To be born in this place?

40:54.326 --> 40:55.786
No, of course not.

40:55.870 --> 40:58.247
It'll make a good story
when you're older at parties.

41:00.708 --> 41:02.960
So, why do you wanna know
about the Visser?

41:04.962 --> 41:06.964
Are you interviewing me now?

41:19.935 --> 41:22.229
There used to be another building here.

41:22.313 --> 41:24.482
It burned down a long time ago.

41:25.357 --> 41:28.110
And then someone
built the Visser right on top.

41:30.779 --> 41:34.033
So, people died here?

41:34.617 --> 41:35.743
Oh, I don't…

41:36.702 --> 41:38.078
No, I don't think so.

41:38.954 --> 41:39.914
I mean…

41:44.293 --> 41:46.670
I just want to know
about the people who live here.

41:47.296 --> 41:48.923
Their friends, their families,

41:49.006 --> 41:50.216
what brings them here,

41:50.758 --> 41:52.635
why they choose this building.

41:57.848 --> 41:59.808
Because something pulled them here.

42:01.685 --> 42:02.686
What?

42:05.898 --> 42:07.650
Did Samuel tell you about this place?

42:09.193 --> 42:10.319
Who's Samuel?

42:14.782 --> 42:16.659
Nothing. Never mind.

42:40.849 --> 42:41.684
Jess?

42:49.441 --> 42:50.734
<i>Jess, are you okay?</i>

43:03.122 --> 43:04.498
Jess, what's happening?

43:14.091 --> 43:15.134
Jess--

43:16.218 --> 43:18.387
-Jess?

43:20.097 --> 43:21.015
Jess!

43:25.894 --> 43:27.187
<i>Are you okay?</i>

43:28.564 --> 43:29.690
<i>Oh, my God, Jess!</i>

43:31.358 --> 43:32.359
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

43:32.943 --> 43:34.653
<i>Jess? Help!</i>

43:35.738 --> 43:36.780
<i>Somebody!</i>

43:36.864 --> 43:37.823
<i>Come on, Jess.</i>

43:38.407 --> 43:39.783
<i>Somebody, help!</i>

43:48.000 --> 43:50.169
<i>Jess.</i>

43:56.425 --> 43:58.344
<i> Are you…</i>

44:39.885 --> 44:42.429
There's gotta be
a fucking signal somewhere.

44:51.814 --> 44:52.898
-<i>Dan.</i>
-Hey.

44:52.981 --> 44:56.193
<i>That message flipped me out, jackhole.</i>
<i>What happened? Why didn't you call back?</i>

44:56.276 --> 44:58.153
I thought you got eaten by a fucking bear.

44:58.237 --> 45:00.614
<i>-Are there bears up there?</i>
-They were listening.

45:01.407 --> 45:02.366
Listening? Who?

45:02.449 --> 45:03.575
LMG.

45:04.910 --> 45:05.953
On the landline.

45:06.829 --> 45:09.957
That is some fucked-up <i>1984</i> bullshit, man.

45:10.040 --> 45:12.042
You never trust a fucking landline.

45:13.419 --> 45:14.420
Are you okay though?

45:14.503 --> 45:16.922
Uh…

45:17.005 --> 45:18.882
Yeah, yeah. Um…

45:20.050 --> 45:21.009
I just…

45:22.970 --> 45:24.179
I thought I saw a…

45:27.891 --> 45:28.934
A what?

45:33.439 --> 45:35.524
Nothing, nothing. Um…

45:36.650 --> 45:38.902
Hey, man, this place
is screwing with my head.

45:40.821 --> 45:43.991
You're not gonna go…
Jack Torrance on me, are you?

45:44.742 --> 45:46.827
Tell me you're not standing
in a hedge maze.

45:47.953 --> 45:50.873
No. No. No ax, no maze. I'm fine.

45:51.540 --> 45:52.458
You sure?

45:52.541 --> 45:53.417
<i>Uh…</i>

45:53.500 --> 45:55.502
<i>Have you found anything</i>
<i>about Tamara Stefano?</i>

45:55.586 --> 45:58.839
Uh, maybe she wrote
an opera or maybe a song?

45:59.923 --> 46:04.636
No. No composers, no musicians,
no artists of any kind by that name.

46:04.720 --> 46:06.680
<i>Guess she never made it to the Met.</i>

46:06.764 --> 46:13.187
Yeah, okay, then just look up whatever
you can find about LMG and Melody Pendras.

46:13.270 --> 46:15.272
<i>Anything you can find.</i>

46:15.355 --> 46:17.941
I'm on it. I'm your fucking Google.

46:18.025 --> 46:19.443
Okay, I'll call you later.

47:12.496 --> 47:13.747
<i>What are you playing?</i>

47:15.999 --> 47:17.125
I don't know.

47:17.209 --> 47:18.544
Where'd you hear it?

47:19.169 --> 47:20.170
On the tape.

47:20.838 --> 47:22.714
Okay, stop playing it.

47:22.798 --> 47:23.757
Right now.

47:26.301 --> 47:28.011
I said stop!

47:33.183 --> 47:35.727
Cleo's been locked up all day.
Take her out for a walk.

47:35.811 --> 47:36.812
All right.

48:11.221 --> 48:12.097
No!

48:13.098 --> 48:14.057
No!

48:15.267 --> 48:16.226
No!

49:03.690 --> 49:05.192
We're friends now, right?

49:05.275 --> 49:07.277
You'd tell me if you saw something?

49:09.071 --> 49:10.030
On the tape?

49:12.199 --> 49:13.283
Right. No, me neither.

49:32.928 --> 49:33.971
<i> I don't… I…</i>

49:35.305 --> 49:36.473
<i>God.</i>

49:36.556 --> 49:38.266
<i>Jess? Jess!</i>

49:49.569 --> 49:51.321
<i>Now can I have some Mountain Dew?</i>

49:52.823 --> 49:54.324
<i>Should I call your mom?</i>

49:55.867 --> 49:58.036
No. I'm fine.

49:58.120 --> 49:59.079
For real.

49:59.913 --> 50:03.291
This is just something that happens.
Sometimes.

50:03.417 --> 50:05.627
What is it? Epilepsy?

50:07.671 --> 50:10.465
The doctor at the clinic
says there's nothing wrong.

50:11.633 --> 50:13.760
He says it's all in my imagination.

50:13.844 --> 50:16.847
Jess, you definitely had a seizure.

50:16.930 --> 50:18.932
That wasn't your imagination.

50:21.727 --> 50:23.145
What does your mom say?

50:23.854 --> 50:27.315
She takes me to see Father Russo
at St. Albert's down the block.

50:27.399 --> 50:29.359
For spiritual guidance, you know?

50:30.861 --> 50:34.156
She says I should
tell him what I see, but…

50:35.741 --> 50:36.950
What do you see?

50:43.623 --> 50:44.916
I don't remember.

50:46.418 --> 50:47.753
I never remember.

50:52.549 --> 50:54.217
Who's Samuel?

50:55.594 --> 50:57.054
Does he live in the building?

50:57.137 --> 50:58.680
Do you go to church?

51:01.349 --> 51:02.392
I used to.

51:03.643 --> 51:05.103
So, you don't anymore?

51:05.854 --> 51:06.855
No.

51:12.152 --> 51:14.738
Do you believe there's another world

51:15.822 --> 51:17.324
besides this one?

51:17.407 --> 51:19.618
You mean, like heaven and hell?

51:19.701 --> 51:22.829
No. I mean, like this one but…

51:24.247 --> 51:25.207
different.

51:25.957 --> 51:27.334
<i>More</i> than this world.

51:34.925 --> 51:36.843
You know what? I'm sorry, Jess.

51:38.053 --> 51:41.807
I should probably ask your mom
for permission to interview you.

51:42.599 --> 51:44.976
Maybe I can meet her after work one day?

51:48.105 --> 51:49.314
You think I'm a freak.

51:50.107 --> 51:52.025
I don't think you're a freak.

51:52.651 --> 51:54.361
People at school think I am.

51:56.655 --> 51:58.615
Kids used to call me a freak too.

51:59.533 --> 52:00.659
Fuck them.

52:04.746 --> 52:06.498
<i>Yeah, fuck 'em.</i>

52:11.711 --> 52:15.382
<i>Do you think I could be more than I am?</i>

52:17.300 --> 52:20.720
<i>Like, do I seem strong enough…</i>

52:23.140 --> 52:25.517
<i>to hold a new world inside of me?</i>

52:28.103 --> 52:31.064
<i>Well, I think you</i>
<i>can be anything you want to be.</i>

52:43.285 --> 52:44.786
<i>I'm glad you're here.</i>

52:50.625 --> 52:52.127
<i>Can I tell you something?</i>

53:05.807 --> 53:06.975
<i>They took her.</i>

53:08.226 --> 53:09.603
<i>They took Jess.</i>

53:14.858 --> 53:17.110
<i>I told you. Sixth floor's off-limits.</i>

53:17.194 --> 53:18.195
<i>Where is she?</i>

53:19.029 --> 53:20.906
<i>What the fuck did you do with her?</i>

53:20.989 --> 53:23.867
<i>-I don't know what you're talking about.</i>
-<i>You fucking took her!</i>

53:27.120 --> 53:29.414
<i>Jess! Jess!</i>

53:29.497 --> 53:30.916
<i>Jess, can you hear me?</i>

53:42.802 --> 53:44.512
 <i>Ah.</i>

53:48.058 --> 53:50.393
<i>Melody, Jess is gone.</i>

53:50.477 --> 53:51.770
<i>Fuck you.</i>

53:55.815 --> 53:56.816
<i>Melody Pendras?</i>

53:56.900 --> 53:58.735
-<i>Who are you?</i>
<i>-We need you to come with us.</i>

53:58.818 --> 54:00.987
-<i> Get the fuck away from me.</i>
<i>What are you doing?</i>

54:01.071 --> 54:02.447
<i>Sir, step back, please.</i>

54:04.115 --> 54:05.242
<i>Please.</i>

54:05.325 --> 54:07.994
<i>Please find me. Please help.</i>

54:09.996 --> 54:11.498
-<i>Fuck you!</i>
-<i>Get your hands off!</i>

54:11.581 --> 54:14.167
-<i>No!</i>
<i>-Melody. Melody.</i>

54:14.251 --> 54:17.337
-<i>What are you doing here?</i>
<i>-It's okay. Everything's okay.</i>

54:19.798 --> 54:21.633
<i>What the fuck are you doing here?</i>

54:21.716 --> 54:23.218
<i>Everything's gonna be fine.</i>

54:23.301 --> 54:24.678
-<i>No!</i>
-Dad?

54:24.761 --> 54:26.554
<i> No! No! No!</i>

54:26.638 --> 54:28.431
<i>Get the fuck off me!</i>

54:28.515 --> 54:29.391
<i>Get the--</i>

54:30.308 --> 54:31.685
What the fuck?

54:34.771 --> 54:37.941
-<i>What are you doing here?</i>
<i>-It's okay. Everything's okay.</i>

54:38.024 --> 54:40.986
<i>-What the fuck are you doing here?</i>
<i>-Everything's gonna be fine.</i>

54:43.571 --> 54:46.283
<i>-What the fuck are you doing here?</i>
<i>-Everything's gonna be fine.</i>

54:46.366 --> 54:48.827
<i>-No!</i>
-What's happening?

54:48.910 --> 54:53.456
<i> No! No! Get the fuck off me!</i>
<i>Get the fuck off me!</i>

55:00.338 --> 55:02.257
<i>What the fuck are you doing here?</i>

55:03.425 --> 55:07.053
<i>No! No! Get the fuck off me!</i>

55:07.137 --> 55:09.139
<i>-Get the fuck off me!</i>
-<i>Dad?</i>

55:09.222 --> 55:11.975
<i>No! What the fuck? No!</i>

55:13.768 --> 55:15.228
<i>Dad, what is happening?</i>

55:15.854 --> 55:16.938
<i>What's happening?</i>

55:19.149 --> 55:20.233
<i>What's happening?</i>

55:20.775 --> 55:21.693
<i>Dad.</i>
