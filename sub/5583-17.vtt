WEBVTT

00:02.603 --> 00:03.837
Previously on Empire...

00:03.871 --> 00:04.872
ANIKA: You think
that someone pushed you?

00:04.905 --> 00:06.006
RHONDA:
I really don't know.

00:06.040 --> 00:07.741
Freda, did you say something
about Frank Gathers?

00:07.775 --> 00:08.876
Yeah, that's my father.

00:08.909 --> 00:10.244
He got murdered in prison.

00:10.278 --> 00:12.646
The Lyon family
will be performing

00:12.680 --> 00:15.083
at this year's ASA awards.

00:15.116 --> 00:16.484
Jamal,

00:16.517 --> 00:18.386
you know D-Major,
musical director

00:18.419 --> 00:19.820
for the ASAs.
JAMAL: Of course.

00:19.853 --> 00:20.888
D-MAJOR:
I try to keep things
professional, man.

00:20.921 --> 00:22.256
And because you're not out.

00:22.290 --> 00:23.557
You know I don't want
to make you do anything

00:23.591 --> 00:24.758
you don't feel comfortable with.

00:24.792 --> 00:26.327
Tiana's doing a duet
with you on a song

00:26.360 --> 00:27.761
you yourself told me
would go platinum.

00:27.795 --> 00:28.896
The producers wanted her.

00:28.929 --> 00:30.064
I bet you never
even brought me up.

00:30.098 --> 00:31.765
If it was me,
I'd be jealous.

00:31.799 --> 00:33.667
If my sister had everything
and I had nothing.

00:33.701 --> 00:35.103
CAROL: You know, I'm about
to get my 90-day chip.

00:35.136 --> 00:36.570
Carol.
Tariq?

00:36.604 --> 00:38.339
So, what, you working
for the NYPD?

00:38.372 --> 00:41.109
No, I quit the force
a long time ago.

00:41.142 --> 00:42.510
COOKIE:
Lucious, who is this lady?

00:42.543 --> 00:44.445
This is Leah Walker,
Lucious' mother.

00:44.478 --> 00:47.181
COOKIE:
She's just a little, old lady,

00:47.215 --> 00:48.782
and there is
nothing to fear.

00:48.816 --> 00:51.419
I'm sorry I was too weak

00:51.452 --> 00:53.221
to kill you
when I had the chance.

00:55.489 --> 00:57.958
Now, tomorrow's the ASAs,
and this song

00:57.991 --> 01:01.395
has to be the highlight
of the show.

01:01.429 --> 01:04.198
I want the entire world
talking about it, okay?

01:04.232 --> 01:05.999
Bring us in.

01:07.435 --> 01:08.369
Stop, stop, stop, stop,

01:08.402 --> 01:10.037
you're too tentative
on the entrance.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.539
You know what?
Start again.

01:11.572 --> 01:13.073
(drummer plays intro)

01:13.107 --> 01:15.409
(band joins in)

01:15.443 --> 01:17.044
Stop. Remember

01:17.077 --> 01:18.646
it's a lullaby.
Look, we're gonna be here

01:18.679 --> 01:20.080
all night until
you get this right.

01:20.114 --> 01:21.649
Okay, start one more time.

01:21.682 --> 01:24.051
Two, three, four.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.286
(band playing)

01:29.257 --> 01:30.591
No, no.

01:30.624 --> 01:32.893
I want the strings
to come in just like that.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.094
Let's try that again.

01:34.128 --> 01:35.929
That chord, uh...

01:37.298 --> 01:40.568
(Lucious vocalizing with piano)

01:40.601 --> 01:41.835
No, tired is not an option.

01:41.869 --> 01:44.905
Get it together.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.607
Bring me back in one more time.

01:47.941 --> 01:50.411
Stop for a second.
Just give me... g-give me

01:50.444 --> 01:51.745
drums and give me bass.

01:51.779 --> 01:52.746
That pace...

01:52.780 --> 01:54.114
that's where we need to be at.

01:54.148 --> 01:56.850
Stop. We're getting there.

01:56.884 --> 01:57.851
We're getting there.

01:57.885 --> 01:59.287
Bring me back in.

01:59.320 --> 02:00.754
Make sure it's strong.

02:00.788 --> 02:01.922
There's no room for error.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.257
Yeah.

02:03.291 --> 02:04.758
This is the ASAs.

02:04.792 --> 02:07.595
(Lucious vocalizing)

02:07.628 --> 02:08.696
I like that, keep going.

02:08.729 --> 02:11.131
(Lucious vocalizing)

02:16.170 --> 02:17.805
Take us there.

02:17.838 --> 02:19.707
Yeah.

02:19.740 --> 02:21.675
Bass, yeah, keep going.

02:23.744 --> 02:25.779
I'm liking this a lot.

02:25.813 --> 02:28.148
Yeah.

02:28.182 --> 02:29.650
(band plays harmoniously)

02:41.829 --> 02:42.896
Give me a couple
minutes here.
Yes.

02:42.930 --> 02:45.165
You guys sound amazing.

02:45.199 --> 02:46.634
Band sounds
great, Lucious.

02:46.667 --> 02:47.901
Thanks, Cook.

02:47.935 --> 02:49.237
They're getting there.
What's up?

02:49.270 --> 02:51.472
How's your mama?

02:51.505 --> 02:52.973
She's still crazy.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.141
She's still
at your house, right?

02:54.174 --> 02:55.175
Yeah.

02:55.209 --> 02:56.744
Mm-hmm.
What's up?

02:56.777 --> 02:58.011
Um, Lucious, look,
I need you to get some rest.

02:58.045 --> 02:59.146
You've been at
this all night.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.147
Give the band a break.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.415
I'll rest when I'm dead,

03:01.449 --> 03:03.150
but right now we got
the ASAs tomorrow,

03:03.183 --> 03:04.652
and they got to be airtight.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.153
You know that this ain't
about the ASAs.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.088
This is about you
avoiding your mother.

03:08.121 --> 03:09.690
Why you letting that woman

03:09.723 --> 03:10.991
do this to you?

03:11.024 --> 03:12.660
Look, stay in
your lane, Cookie.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.262
Hey, Lucious, come here.

03:14.295 --> 03:15.596
Lucious...

03:15.629 --> 03:16.764
you're working yourself

03:16.797 --> 03:18.666
so hard so you can avoid.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.200
You have
to deal with this.

03:20.234 --> 03:21.869
Look, you didn't
go home last night.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.837
The other night you stayed
in your office.

03:23.871 --> 03:26.840
I told you,
the woman's dangerous,

03:26.874 --> 03:28.041
and I don't trust her.

03:28.075 --> 03:30.110
All right?

03:30.143 --> 03:32.179
Can I get back
to work, please?

03:32.212 --> 03:33.514
All right, Lucious.

03:33.547 --> 03:36.216
All right, count us
back in, sweetheart.

03:41.889 --> 03:43.291
FEMALE REPORTER:
We are one day away

03:43.324 --> 03:46.193
from the 54th Annual
American Sound Awards.

03:46.226 --> 03:49.029
The big question
everybody is asking:

03:49.062 --> 03:50.197
which Lyon will come...

03:50.230 --> 03:52.232
ANNOUNCER: Tomorrow night
on Fox, the 54th...

03:52.266 --> 03:54.468
WEATHERMAN:
The rain is supposed to clear up
for tomorrow, so it should be...

03:54.502 --> 03:56.069
Ms. Walker.

03:56.103 --> 04:01.409
Toast, ham, scrambled eggs,
everything you like.

04:01.442 --> 04:03.210
No. Seasoning.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.545
Pardon me?

04:04.578 --> 04:05.813
You don't season your food.

04:05.846 --> 04:07.481
I'm not eating it.

04:07.515 --> 04:08.916
Just give me coffee.

04:08.949 --> 04:10.551
...covering the red carpet.

04:10.584 --> 04:11.585
Forecast earlier...

04:11.619 --> 04:12.720
MAN:
It's an honor to be nominated--

04:12.753 --> 04:14.388
I mean, a big honor--

04:14.422 --> 04:16.223
and I'm really exci...

04:16.256 --> 04:17.558
(cheering on television)

04:17.591 --> 04:18.926
I thought I fired you.

04:18.959 --> 04:19.927
Hmm.

04:19.960 --> 04:21.495
WOMAN:
Katy Perry, Taylor Swift.

04:21.529 --> 04:23.831
WOMAN 2:
Ah, well, I can't wait
to see what Taylor Swift...

04:23.864 --> 04:25.333
FEMALE REPORTER:
In the video for his nominated

04:25.366 --> 04:26.900
hit song,
"Boom Boom Boom Boom,"

04:26.934 --> 04:28.336
Lucious Lyon shares

04:28.369 --> 04:30.070
a heartbreaking story about his

04:30.103 --> 04:32.072
bipolar mother
who took her own life.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.841
It's a rare look inside

04:33.874 --> 04:35.343
one man's very
personal journey

04:35.376 --> 04:37.345
through pain and poverty.

04:37.378 --> 04:39.079
Lucious Lyon's
own journey this year

04:39.112 --> 04:41.349
has been remarkable,
having served

04:41.382 --> 04:43.183
three months in prison
for what many

04:43.216 --> 04:45.085
consider a racially
motivated prosecution,

04:45.118 --> 04:46.420
and then losing

04:46.454 --> 04:47.421
and regaining control

04:47.455 --> 04:49.256
of his Empire Entertainment,

04:49.289 --> 04:50.358
only to emerge with...

04:50.391 --> 04:52.626
Boom.

04:52.660 --> 04:53.861
...one of the biggest
hits of his career.

04:53.894 --> 04:55.796
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

04:55.829 --> 04:56.930
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

04:56.964 --> 04:58.366
Boom.

04:58.399 --> 05:00.768
* Bang, bang, bang, bang
Boom.

05:00.801 --> 05:05.639
He's always been a liar.

05:05.673 --> 05:08.442
A bald-faced liar.

05:08.476 --> 05:11.111
* Bang, bang, bang, bang.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.481
*

05:18.151 --> 05:19.286
Thank you, William.
Okay.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.455
Hey, Cook, look, Rhonda
just fit me in this dress.

05:21.489 --> 05:23.791
It's banging, right?

05:23.824 --> 05:24.825
So what do you think

05:24.858 --> 05:26.394
about me wearing
it to the ASAs?

05:26.427 --> 05:29.129
Thanks. Sure, but not
if you're going with me.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.631
You need to tell Rhonda
to get you something

05:30.664 --> 05:31.899
a little more appropriate.

05:31.932 --> 05:33.801
You look like a cheap

05:33.834 --> 05:35.302
prostitute.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.838
So what skank you think
Lucious is taking?

05:37.871 --> 05:40.808
Girl, I don't know,
and I don't care.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.976
All I care about is getting
those boys up on that stage,

05:43.010 --> 05:45.646
because come Sunday,
all the headlines

05:45.679 --> 05:48.148
are gonna be calling us
"The First Family of Hip Hop,"

05:48.181 --> 05:49.817
and that is all I care about.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.852
Girl, guess who I ran
into at the restaurant

05:51.885 --> 05:54.254
on Great Jones Street.

05:54.287 --> 05:56.356
Tariq Cousins,
remember him?

05:56.390 --> 05:57.758
Fine-ass Tariq?

05:57.791 --> 05:59.693
Tariq the Freak?
Yeah.

05:59.727 --> 06:01.529
The cop?
No, no...

06:01.562 --> 06:03.831
he's not working
for the Philly PD anymore.

06:03.864 --> 06:04.932
He lives here
in New York.

06:04.965 --> 06:06.333
(phone chimes)
Girl...

06:06.366 --> 06:08.502
he just invited me
to dinner at Laviticus.

06:08.536 --> 06:10.504
Ooh, you know,
I'm gonna ask Rhonda

06:10.538 --> 06:11.705
if I could borrow this dress

06:11.739 --> 06:14.041
just in case Tariq
wants to freak!

06:14.074 --> 06:15.943
Yes, Tariq!

06:15.976 --> 06:18.378
(sighs)

06:20.247 --> 06:22.215
*

06:22.249 --> 06:25.185
JAMAL: * Said I got to do,
got to do my own thing *

06:25.218 --> 06:26.353
* I do my own thing

06:26.386 --> 06:27.521

* Can't nobody

06:35.729 --> 06:37.465
* What to do,
tell me what to do *

06:37.498 --> 06:38.466
JAMAL:
* Can't nobody, ugh

* A bean

06:43.437 --> 06:44.872
* No stranger to struggling

06:44.905 --> 06:47.374
* Making something
out of nothing *

06:47.407 --> 06:49.309
* Yeah
* Uh, yeah, for nothin'

06:49.342 --> 06:50.544
* It's somethin', I do it
* Oh, yeah

* Doin' what I do

06:58.686 --> 06:59.987
FREDA:

07:00.020 --> 07:02.322
* My way, my way
* I got to do it my way

07:02.355 --> 07:04.091
JAMAL:

* My way, my way, my way

07:11.431 --> 07:13.000
* Yeah, I got
to do it my way. *

07:13.033 --> 07:15.669
So?

07:15.703 --> 07:17.437
I mean, obviously,
we ain't done yet,

07:17.471 --> 07:19.740
but what do you think?

07:19.773 --> 07:22.275
I, uh...

07:22.309 --> 07:23.443
on the real...

07:24.612 --> 07:25.613
...that's that brand-new
right there.

07:25.646 --> 07:26.614
You got something.

07:26.647 --> 07:27.915
Yeah?
(chuckles)

07:27.948 --> 07:28.916
You do.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.918
Yeah, it's fire.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.620
Yo, seriously, though,
he's a tougher critic

07:32.653 --> 07:33.921
than my mom.
I know, wow.

07:33.954 --> 07:34.922
Thank you.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.189
Oh, no, no, no, no,

07:36.223 --> 07:37.257
the two of y'all did that.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.926
For real, you got magic.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.861
Thank you.
Oh!

07:40.894 --> 07:42.129
We can't lose it!

07:42.162 --> 07:43.764
That's magic.
That's what's up, right?

07:43.797 --> 07:45.799
Right, look, I'm-a get back
to the shop, cut some heads.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.434
Yeah.
D-Major, man,

07:47.467 --> 07:48.602
I appreciate it;
it's a pleasure.

07:48.636 --> 07:49.603
All right.

07:49.637 --> 07:50.771
I'll catch y'all later.

07:50.804 --> 07:51.805
All right, Freda.
All right.

07:53.507 --> 07:55.308
(elevator bell dings)

07:55.342 --> 07:59.479
J... it's time
to let your mom go.

08:02.482 --> 08:03.617
You ain't serious?

08:03.651 --> 08:04.652
I'm dead-ass.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.620
Hell no, Derek.

08:06.654 --> 08:07.721
That's my mother,

08:07.755 --> 08:09.456
and-and besides,
I love working with her.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.458
She's producing the whole damn
Black and White album.

08:11.491 --> 08:12.826
Jamal...

08:12.860 --> 08:14.562
you're so much
bigger than whatever

08:14.595 --> 08:16.797
your moms and pops could do
for your sound right now.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.966
Plus they keep you twisted up.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.233
It's time for
you to be more

08:20.267 --> 08:22.469
than a musical
mama's boy.

08:22.502 --> 08:23.804
You should level up.

08:23.837 --> 08:26.540
Let me produce your next album.

08:28.609 --> 08:30.077
You want to produce
my next album?

08:30.110 --> 08:32.479
Yeah.

08:32.512 --> 08:35.348
Unless I ain't
big enough for you.

08:37.017 --> 08:39.753
Party with disguises.

08:39.787 --> 08:40.821
Ten letters.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.656
You tell me.

08:42.690 --> 08:44.524
Masked ball.

08:44.558 --> 08:45.793
(chuckles)

08:47.961 --> 08:49.763
So, you good, Grandma?

08:49.797 --> 08:50.831
Are you eating right?

08:50.864 --> 08:51.999
You taking your medication?

08:52.032 --> 08:53.934
So many pills, make me choke.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.203
Why can't they put
it all in one?

08:56.236 --> 08:58.205
But you feel
better, right?

08:58.238 --> 09:01.274
Do the staff take you out
to get some fresh air?

09:01.308 --> 09:03.611
So many maids and people
working in this house,

09:03.644 --> 09:05.045
it feels like
Gone with the Wind.

09:05.078 --> 09:08.415
But everybody treats you
respectfully, right?

09:10.383 --> 09:12.019
I don't like being left out.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.520
Left out, how?

09:13.553 --> 09:15.355
They talk about
it on the TV,

09:15.388 --> 09:17.324
and I know Dwight's
gonna be in it.

09:19.727 --> 09:21.194
You talking
about the ASAs?

09:21.228 --> 09:23.030
They said my whole
family's performing,

09:23.063 --> 09:24.231
but nobody invited me.

09:24.264 --> 09:25.699
Do you know

09:25.733 --> 09:28.368
I've never even
seen him on a stage?

09:28.401 --> 09:31.371
Lucious Lyon.

09:31.404 --> 09:35.308
Look, I'd-I'd love to
take you to the ASAs, Grandma.

09:35.342 --> 09:38.879
I'd need to talk
to Empire's PR department

09:38.912 --> 09:40.480
to see if we can even
get an extra ticket.

09:40.513 --> 09:41.915
Tell Dwight
to talk to them.

09:41.949 --> 09:43.250
He can get me a ticket.

09:43.283 --> 09:45.218
(sighs)
You'd need a new dress...

09:45.252 --> 09:47.487
and I would have to

09:47.520 --> 09:49.556
run it by Pop. It could be
a tricky situation.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.491
Because he wishes I was dead.

09:51.524 --> 09:52.826
Grandma, he doesn't
wish that you were...

09:52.860 --> 09:54.227
That's what he
told everybody

09:54.261 --> 09:55.328
in that movie he made.

09:55.362 --> 09:56.730
That was just a movie.

09:56.764 --> 09:58.732
Okay, it was a story,
make-believe.

09:58.766 --> 09:59.767
Now, the problem...

09:59.800 --> 10:01.434
I won't tell anybody he lied,

10:01.468 --> 10:04.571
if that's what you're scared of.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.674
I just want to see
my grandbabies up there

10:06.707 --> 10:08.241
on that stage, that's all.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.910
It would destroy
his credibility

10:09.943 --> 10:12.245
if anybody found
out, Grandma.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.081
It'd be bad for Empire,
and it would be

10:14.114 --> 10:16.083
really, really bad for Pop.

10:16.116 --> 10:20.520
Honey, there's gonna be
so many pretty girls there,

10:20.553 --> 10:22.923
nobody's even
gonna look sideways

10:22.956 --> 10:25.325
at a little old lady.

10:44.912 --> 10:46.947
Hey, Rhonda.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.448
Hey.
Oh, hey.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.783
Sorry, do you
have a minute?

10:49.817 --> 10:52.285
Well, I'm on my way
to a fitting for a bunch

10:52.319 --> 10:54.321
of artists for
the ASAs, uh, well...

10:54.354 --> 10:56.323
I'll meet you guys there,
just go ahead without me.
Sure.

10:56.356 --> 10:57.390
Hey, sorry.

10:57.424 --> 10:58.391
Sorry, I barely
have a minute.

10:58.425 --> 10:59.827
What's up?
Um...

10:59.860 --> 11:02.462
You weren't at yoga
the other day and, uh,

11:02.495 --> 11:04.297
I thought I'd see you there,
and I've been texting you,

11:04.331 --> 11:05.465
and it's just not like you
to not respond, so...

11:05.498 --> 11:06.834
I've just been crazed

11:06.867 --> 11:08.301
dressing all these artists,
that's all.

11:08.335 --> 11:11.204
Oh, okay.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.308
Oh.

11:15.342 --> 11:17.677
Oh, my God,
I'm starting to show,

11:17.711 --> 11:19.813
and it's painful for you,
I'm sorry, Rhonda.

11:19.847 --> 11:21.348
No.
I'm so stupid.

11:21.381 --> 11:22.750
No, no, Anika.
I should be
more sensitive.

11:22.783 --> 11:23.751
I'm fine, honestly.

11:23.784 --> 11:24.918
I'm happy for you.

11:26.019 --> 11:28.155
But I was gonna ask you
a question, actually.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.322
Do you remember
when you came over

11:29.356 --> 11:31.358
that day to see
the nursery and...

11:31.391 --> 11:32.659
you were wearing
those really cute shoes?

11:32.692 --> 11:33.827
They had red soles.

11:33.861 --> 11:34.862
They were Louboutins, right?

11:34.895 --> 11:36.163
Oh, God, I don't remember

11:36.196 --> 11:37.164
what I was wearing.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.165
(laughing): Why?

11:38.198 --> 11:39.432
Just because I feel like

11:39.466 --> 11:41.168
they're good day-to-night shoes,

11:41.201 --> 11:43.670
so I was wondering if you
were wearing them that night.

11:43.703 --> 11:44.938
Were you?

11:44.972 --> 11:47.274
Did we see each other
that night?

11:47.307 --> 11:49.843
I don't know.

11:49.877 --> 11:52.545
Did we?

11:57.717 --> 11:59.452
LAURA:
Okay, so...

11:59.486 --> 12:01.688
think a winter wonderland.

12:01.721 --> 12:02.689
Snow...

12:02.722 --> 12:05.625
icicles, an all silver cake.

12:05.658 --> 12:07.861
That's gonna be shiny.

12:07.895 --> 12:09.362
All the mags are
already scrambling

12:09.396 --> 12:11.198
to get the first pictures
of the bride and groom.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.133
Look, I don't even know if
I want paparazzi at our wedding.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.068
But if we give
Us Weekly an exclusive,

12:15.102 --> 12:16.203
maybe they'll highlight

12:16.236 --> 12:17.971
some of my music
on their site.

12:18.005 --> 12:20.207
It's just one magazine. I don't
think that'll cheapen it.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.442
* Do it *
* Tell mama you know I...

12:22.475 --> 12:24.477
Look, Laura, bae, I don't
want you to blame yourself.

12:24.511 --> 12:26.713
It's my fault.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.049
* Say it *
* You gon' have to do less
when you... *

12:29.082 --> 12:31.384
But your career ain't gonna take
off the way we wanted it to.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.620
* Show it *
* See, you gon' need
to do more than just *

12:33.653 --> 12:35.055
* Prove it *
* Oh, baby

12:35.088 --> 12:37.224
You don't believe in me anymore.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.725
* You know

12:38.758 --> 12:40.293
* Say it, baby

12:40.327 --> 12:43.897
* Do it, baby...

12:43.931 --> 12:47.167
Look, we worked hard,
the both of us.

12:47.200 --> 12:50.270
You did a couple dope songs.

12:50.303 --> 12:53.240
You opened up
for Tiana on tour...

12:53.273 --> 12:55.242
but it just hasn't popped yet.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.243
* Baby...

12:56.276 --> 12:58.778
But look...

12:58.812 --> 13:00.413
we can still give
Us Weekly that exclusive.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.581
Stop.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.084
* See your body move
in different ways... *

13:04.117 --> 13:05.919
My dream is marrying you.

13:05.953 --> 13:06.920
(kisses)

13:06.954 --> 13:08.255
That's enough for me right now.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.923
* You make me come through

13:09.957 --> 13:14.194
* I get so close to you.

13:14.227 --> 13:16.196
Carol's story panned out.

13:16.229 --> 13:18.365
Tariq quit the force in 2010.

13:18.398 --> 13:19.432
Why?

13:19.466 --> 13:21.634
Don't know, files are sealed.

13:21.668 --> 13:23.103
Some kind of police policy.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.104
Even Thirst couldn't open it up,

13:24.137 --> 13:25.105
which means...

13:25.138 --> 13:26.373
Which means he's a Fed now.

13:26.406 --> 13:28.108
That's what it means.
Yeah, but

13:28.141 --> 13:29.776
this is the problem,
now, I mean, why would

13:29.809 --> 13:31.778
the Feds want to
rumble with me again,

13:31.811 --> 13:34.714
especially after that little
fiasco with Roxanne Ford?

13:34.747 --> 13:36.950
Now your boy,
Tariq, I mean,

13:36.984 --> 13:38.118
I ain't never
hung with him,

13:38.151 --> 13:39.486
but he was always respectful

13:39.519 --> 13:41.388
back when we was grinding,

13:41.421 --> 13:43.456
but him and your sister,
that's...

13:43.490 --> 13:46.960
Exactly, why would he want
to get mixed up with Carol?

13:46.994 --> 13:48.795
Everybody know
Carol's a crackhead...

13:48.828 --> 13:50.730
and she got three
illegitimate kids.

13:50.763 --> 13:51.798
That don't make sense.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.000
They not slick.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.134
Thirsty might be done

13:54.167 --> 13:55.668
investigating Tariq,
but I'm not.

13:57.004 --> 13:58.238
Speaking about crackheads,

13:58.271 --> 14:00.073
why are you taking her
to the ASAs?

14:00.107 --> 14:02.509
Yeah, well, I heard
you was gonna ask me

14:02.542 --> 14:04.744
until you found out
I had a date.

14:04.777 --> 14:07.814
No, that's all right,
I'm-a take a supermodel.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.917
Oh, Lucious, don't nobody
want your fat ass.

14:09.950 --> 14:11.818
Yeah, I'm only fat
where it counts.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.420
In the mouth.

14:13.453 --> 14:15.488
* Come and get it,
come and get it *

14:15.522 --> 14:17.657
(chuckles)
* Come and get it,
come and get it *

14:17.690 --> 14:19.326
* You know we got it over here,
be clear *

14:19.359 --> 14:20.693
* Baby, I know
that you're wit' it *

14:20.727 --> 14:23.030
* Come and get it, uh

14:23.063 --> 14:24.864
* Ten bottles at the table

14:24.898 --> 14:27.434
* You know we got it over here,
be clear, baby... *

14:27.467 --> 14:29.169
Well, well, well.
Cookie.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.503
If it isn't
Tariq Cousins.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.172
You okay?
Did I scare you?

14:32.205 --> 14:33.173
No, no, good to see you.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.174
Eh, don't lie.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.176
Look like you seen a ghost.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.611
(both laugh)

14:38.645 --> 14:41.181
I'm not as gullible
as my sister.

14:41.214 --> 14:42.849
(both chuckle)
Uh-huh.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.018
Ooh, uh, FYI,
she doesn't know I'm here.

14:45.052 --> 14:47.187
Uh-huh.
Carol, she always late.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.521
Yeah.

14:48.555 --> 14:51.024
I remember you bailing her out
of a bunch of jams.

14:51.058 --> 14:53.360
Yeah, family,
that's what you do.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.528
Of course, you stole a bunch
of her boyfriends, too,

14:55.562 --> 14:56.863
and didn't she even hook up

14:56.896 --> 14:58.698
with, uh, Lucious
before y'all hooked up?

14:58.731 --> 15:01.068
See, that's not quite
how that happened,

15:01.101 --> 15:02.735
Tariq the Freak.

15:02.769 --> 15:04.904
(both chuckle)
The Freak.

15:04.938 --> 15:07.707
Look, I know you a Fed,

15:07.740 --> 15:09.542
so you better
not be planning

15:09.576 --> 15:11.044
on putting the squeeze
on my sister

15:11.078 --> 15:13.646
to try to come
for me or my family.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.782
You got something to hide?

15:17.117 --> 15:18.385
(laughs)

15:18.418 --> 15:19.886
It's an innocent date.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.654
I ran into her and wanted
to hang, you know.

15:21.688 --> 15:22.889
Hmm.
New York

15:22.922 --> 15:24.491
is colder than a pimp's heart

15:24.524 --> 15:26.059
on $65K a year.

15:26.093 --> 15:27.560
Mm.
I miss Philly.

15:27.594 --> 15:30.063
Yeah, we always said
you was one of the good ones.

15:30.097 --> 15:31.264
Yeah,

15:31.298 --> 15:33.000
you never forgot the "G" code.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.834
Nah, never that.

15:34.867 --> 15:36.403
I grew up on
those streets, Cookie.

15:36.436 --> 15:37.670
That code means more

15:37.704 --> 15:39.072
to me than any
badge I wear,

15:39.106 --> 15:40.573
any oath of office I take...

15:40.607 --> 15:42.675
which is why I'm
surprised you still

15:42.709 --> 15:44.611
rocking with Lucious
when he's the one who

15:44.644 --> 15:46.346
violated it.

15:46.379 --> 15:47.914
Lucious?

15:47.947 --> 15:49.182
Yeah.

15:49.216 --> 15:51.218
Yeah, he killed
your cousin, Bunkie.

15:58.458 --> 15:59.692
You enjoy

15:59.726 --> 16:00.860
your dinner

16:00.893 --> 16:02.295
at my and Lucious' club.

16:02.329 --> 16:05.465
Oh, and watch out.

16:05.498 --> 16:08.435
My sister has herpes.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.170
Hope it's not too late.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.973
(grunts)

16:22.582 --> 16:24.451
FEMALE REPORTER: The countdown
to the ASAs is on.

16:24.484 --> 16:25.652
What will your favorite
star be wearing?

16:25.685 --> 16:26.786
Who will be best dressed,

16:26.819 --> 16:28.455
worst, and most importantly,

16:28.488 --> 16:29.889
who will they be posing with?

16:29.922 --> 16:30.957
Stay tuned.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.625
STEVE:
Tonight's gonna be a madhouse.

16:32.659 --> 16:35.128
Okay, so you handle Jamal
'cause he's got to get

16:35.162 --> 16:36.729
the most press
out of this, uh...

16:36.763 --> 16:40.433
Steve, can y'all excuse me
for a second?

16:44.171 --> 16:47.340
So, did you have fun
with Tariq last night?

16:47.374 --> 16:50.143
As a matter of fact, I did,

16:50.177 --> 16:52.011
and he told me
you came to say hey.

16:52.045 --> 16:53.980
Why don't you just
back off, Cookie?

16:54.013 --> 16:55.815
Tariq's interested
in me, not you.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.484
What did you tell him?

16:57.517 --> 16:59.252
What do you think, I'm stupid?

16:59.286 --> 17:00.820
(chuckles)

17:00.853 --> 17:02.322
He's not
investigating anybody.

17:02.355 --> 17:03.323
Oh, he's not?

17:03.356 --> 17:04.324
No.
Okay.

17:04.357 --> 17:05.325
No, we just talked.

17:05.358 --> 17:06.926
All we did was talk.

17:06.959 --> 17:08.528
Oh, well, what did
y'all talk about?

17:08.561 --> 17:11.164
He told me that Raheem
had to get his leg

17:11.198 --> 17:12.332
cut off from
the knee down.

17:12.365 --> 17:13.500
Raheem, really?

17:13.533 --> 17:14.501
Really?

17:14.534 --> 17:16.169
He is working you, stupid.

17:16.203 --> 17:17.537
No, he is not!

17:17.570 --> 17:18.771
(sighs)

17:18.805 --> 17:20.273
You know,
it is possible

17:20.307 --> 17:22.175
for a good man
to like me, Cookie,

17:22.209 --> 17:24.111
and this time,
you're not gonna steal him

17:24.144 --> 17:26.179
or try to poison him in my head.

17:26.213 --> 17:28.448
Come here.

17:28.481 --> 17:30.783
Come here. Come over
here and talk to me.

17:30.817 --> 17:32.352
Sit down, you're
all the way over there.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.221
You're all tense.

17:34.254 --> 17:37.724
You had a drink last night
with Tariq, didn't you?

17:37.757 --> 17:41.027
Man, I told you, if
you fall off again,

17:41.060 --> 17:44.030
that your ass was out,
and I meant that!

17:44.063 --> 17:45.632
You know you always stealing
my boyfriends, right?

17:45.665 --> 17:48.701
You stole Sean,

17:48.735 --> 17:50.537
then Kyle, yeah... Lucious.

17:50.570 --> 17:51.538
Right...

17:51.571 --> 17:53.573
right, 'cause...

17:53.606 --> 17:55.041
if I'd never showed up,

17:55.074 --> 17:56.409
Lucious would have
ended up with you.

17:56.443 --> 17:58.044
Yeah, well, he met me first,

17:58.077 --> 17:59.379
then here you come.

17:59.412 --> 18:00.747
Here come Cookie.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.649
Every time
you fall off the wagon,

18:02.682 --> 18:03.883
I get the blame.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.552
I'm sick of it, Carol.

18:05.585 --> 18:08.421
You really believe

18:08.455 --> 18:10.557
that you deserve my life.

18:10.590 --> 18:13.393
Your sick ass
really believe that.

18:13.426 --> 18:14.894
Candace was
right about you.
Candace.

18:14.927 --> 18:15.995
Yeah, she was so right

18:16.028 --> 18:17.397
about you.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.765
You don't give a damn

18:18.798 --> 18:19.932
about me.

18:19.966 --> 18:21.734
All you care
about is making

18:21.768 --> 18:22.902
yourself feel better.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.437
That's why you keep me around.

18:24.471 --> 18:26.273
You ain't got
nothing of your own,

18:26.306 --> 18:28.941
just what Lucious
is letting you have.

18:28.975 --> 18:30.743
That's how you feel?

18:30.777 --> 18:32.011
Yeah, that's how it is.

18:32.044 --> 18:33.079
Okay...

18:33.112 --> 18:34.281
well, then bounce, Carol.

18:34.981 --> 18:36.082
Bounce your ass

18:36.115 --> 18:37.917
out of my company.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.419
That's how you feel?

18:39.452 --> 18:41.087
I don't care about you?!

18:41.120 --> 18:44.257
Then get your raggedy stuff
out of my apartment!

18:44.291 --> 18:47.126
That's what you can do since
I don't care about you,

18:47.160 --> 18:49.128
and you know what,
forget about the ASAs!

18:49.162 --> 18:51.698
'Cause I'm not taking
no washed up crackhead

18:51.731 --> 18:53.099
to no ASAs!

18:53.132 --> 18:54.801
'Cause you ain't
gonna embarrass me.

18:54.834 --> 18:55.935
Get out!

18:55.968 --> 18:56.936
I don't care
about you.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.771
I said get out!

18:58.805 --> 19:00.540
Get out!

19:00.573 --> 19:02.842
I don't care about you.

19:03.743 --> 19:05.745
(music playing)

19:07.580 --> 19:11.218
* Gonna tell a story of

19:11.251 --> 19:14.787
* A fella who fell in love

19:14.821 --> 19:16.956
* I said that I had before

19:16.989 --> 19:19.992
* But now I'm even mesure,
phonetically in my *

19:20.026 --> 19:21.628
* Heart

19:21.661 --> 19:24.464
* I thought that
I would get the less *

19:24.497 --> 19:28.134
* But now I see I get the best

19:28.167 --> 19:30.637
* No more time wasted,
not trying to make a statement *

19:30.670 --> 19:33.973
* The words are coming
out my head *

19:34.006 --> 19:34.974
* At night

19:35.007 --> 19:36.142
* In the moonlight

19:36.175 --> 19:38.311
* I see your smiling eyes...

19:38.345 --> 19:39.812
Hey, man, I love that.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.648
You know what I really
love about it?

19:41.681 --> 19:43.483
It's your voice, man.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.585
It resonates.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.019
* You are my butterfly

19:47.053 --> 19:48.655
I still say the tempo
is too slow.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.022
* You knew I'd be your man

19:50.056 --> 19:51.591
You need to
work on that.

19:51.624 --> 19:53.493
Yeah, I could do that.

19:53.526 --> 19:54.994
* You needed me

19:55.027 --> 19:56.162
Hey, Jamal.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.664
* And now just like...

19:57.697 --> 19:59.031
Promise me something.
Mm-hmm.

19:59.065 --> 20:00.700
When you see me tonight,

20:00.733 --> 20:03.102
on the carpet
with Chanel,

20:03.135 --> 20:04.203
don't let that mean
anything to you.

20:04.237 --> 20:07.507
* I wanna say

20:07.540 --> 20:09.876
* I know I...
(stops music)

20:09.909 --> 20:11.043
You know how many rappers

20:11.077 --> 20:12.445
and producers are gonna be

20:12.479 --> 20:13.713
on the carpet with
supermodels as their beard?

20:13.746 --> 20:14.747
No, it's wack.

20:14.781 --> 20:17.384
Listen, man, relax.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.721
It's just one night.

20:21.754 --> 20:23.155
Yo, get off me, man!

20:24.223 --> 20:26.359
Bro, don't you ever come
at me like that again, bro.

20:26.393 --> 20:27.894
What?
You heard me, what?

20:27.927 --> 20:29.796
I swear, if you ever
touch me like that ag...

20:29.829 --> 20:31.631
Yo, Lucious,
this your son?

20:31.664 --> 20:33.199
Yo, you need
to talk to him.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.335
'Cause this ain't cool.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.777
(laughs)

20:44.811 --> 20:47.380
I see D-Major's still on the DL.

20:47.414 --> 20:49.549
Must've got to you.

20:49.582 --> 20:50.983
You knew?

20:51.017 --> 20:54.086
A real dog can always
tell a fake bitch.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.888
Dad, can you stop
with all the stupid riddles.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.557
How did you know?

20:57.590 --> 20:59.659
I've been in this business
so long, you think I don't

20:59.692 --> 21:02.562
know a little bit about
everybody in this industry?

21:02.595 --> 21:06.566
And even though D-Major's
a talented producer,

21:06.599 --> 21:09.168
his secret life
is not so secretive.

21:09.201 --> 21:11.504
And everybody knows
how he likes to turn

21:11.538 --> 21:14.273
rich boys into his little bitch.

21:14.307 --> 21:18.177
How do you know I ain't turning
him into my little bitch?

21:18.210 --> 21:19.946
He came on to me.
I didn't come on to him.

21:19.979 --> 21:21.514
Exactly.

21:21.548 --> 21:23.115
I bet you he's on top.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.252
You're disgusting, Dad.
No.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.921
What's disgusting is what
you're doing in my studio.

21:28.955 --> 21:31.691
Anybody could've walked
in here and saw you,

21:31.724 --> 21:32.759
and I taught you
better than that.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.126
You don't crap
where you eat.

21:34.160 --> 21:35.428
Yeah, Dad, you're right.
You're enjoying this.

21:35.462 --> 21:37.697
Enjoying what?

21:37.730 --> 21:38.698
You think I enjoy watching

21:38.731 --> 21:39.932
my son become some closet

21:39.966 --> 21:42.034
phony's little bitch?

21:42.068 --> 21:44.371
Look, man, I've tried to be
sensitive to your way of life.

21:44.404 --> 21:46.439
There it is. S-Sensitive
to-to my way of life.

21:46.473 --> 21:48.375
I've listened to you.

21:48.408 --> 21:50.443
I've tried to tolerate something

21:50.477 --> 21:52.612
that is intolerable
to my nature.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.280
I tried to understand

21:54.313 --> 21:56.616
and be respectful
of your choices,

21:56.649 --> 21:58.117
but you don't respect me.

21:58.150 --> 22:00.152
You just keep throwing
this unnatural way

22:00.186 --> 22:03.656
of life into my face.

22:03.690 --> 22:05.958
I've tried to talk
to you as a man,

22:05.992 --> 22:08.294
but all you do is turn
into some little girl,

22:08.327 --> 22:09.962
mad about something I did to you

22:09.996 --> 22:12.465
20 years ago.
20 years ago.

22:12.499 --> 22:14.467
You're crying like a little
bitch about your mother

22:14.501 --> 22:15.902
throwing you in some water
40 years ago,

22:15.935 --> 22:17.804
so what does that say about you?

22:17.837 --> 22:19.138
Can't even look the woman
in the eyes without crying.

22:19.171 --> 22:20.306
I'm not crying.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.508
Always telling me,

22:21.541 --> 22:22.842
"Jamal, don't be
a little sissy bitch.

22:22.875 --> 22:24.477
Put it into music."

22:24.511 --> 22:26.546
Well, Lucious, don't be a sissy
bitch. Put it into mu...

22:30.850 --> 22:33.085
You ain't nothing to me

22:33.119 --> 22:35.054
but a disappointment.

22:36.355 --> 22:39.191
And the day you die from AIDS...

22:40.560 --> 22:44.464
...I'm gonna celebrate.

23:05.885 --> 23:07.286
Right when you think that
Lucious can't stoop any lower,

23:07.319 --> 23:08.955
he does, every single time.
Okay, what did he do?

23:08.988 --> 23:10.289
So I'm in the studio
with D-Major,

23:10.322 --> 23:12.191
'cause he wants
to produce me and Freda.

23:12.224 --> 23:13.693
And then Lucious...
Wh-Wh-What did
you just say?

23:13.726 --> 23:15.227
Mom, I told him no, okay?

23:15.261 --> 23:16.863
But at this point, I should
work with more producers.

23:16.896 --> 23:18.364
Okay, so you're back
working with Freda?

23:18.397 --> 23:20.032
Why is that important?
That's not even the issue.

23:20.066 --> 23:21.468
Jamal, come on.
Lucious comes
into the studio...

23:21.501 --> 23:23.202
No, no, no, no, you need
to let Freda go, Jamal.

23:23.235 --> 23:26.072
No, Ma. Mom, no.
You got to let her go.

23:26.105 --> 23:27.807
This is not about Freda.
This is about Lucious.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.075
This is about me.

23:29.108 --> 23:31.143
And the things that we said
that you can't come back from.

23:31.177 --> 23:33.980
Hey, hey, hey. (sighs)

23:34.013 --> 23:35.882
You remember that prosecutor

23:35.915 --> 23:38.485
who was so hell-bent on trying
to bring your father down?

23:38.518 --> 23:41.387
Yeah, um, Tits McGee.

23:41.420 --> 23:42.722
Yeah, that bitch.

23:42.755 --> 23:45.892
Well, the Feds are still
coming for us.

23:45.925 --> 23:47.393
Okay?

23:47.426 --> 23:50.396
So we need to lay low,
all right?

23:50.429 --> 23:52.331
Be easy. Be careful.
All of us.

23:52.364 --> 23:53.500
We need to lay low?
All of us?

23:53.533 --> 23:55.568
Nah, they're coming for Lucious.

23:55.602 --> 23:57.169
And tell me why I should
care about that.

23:57.203 --> 23:59.105
I got to worry about what's
wrong with him and my music.

23:59.138 --> 24:01.240
What would be my incentive
to let go of my music for him?

24:01.273 --> 24:03.142
(sighs)

24:04.877 --> 24:10.617
You ever wonder how I got
out early on good behavior?

24:12.384 --> 24:15.855
Honestly, I-I assumed you
informed on somebody, but I...

24:15.888 --> 24:17.890
His name...

24:19.458 --> 24:21.460
His name...

24:23.630 --> 24:25.932
(gunshots)
Did you see who shot him?

24:25.965 --> 24:27.934
Can you name that shooter?

24:27.967 --> 24:31.303
Frank Gathers.

24:33.072 --> 24:34.206
Ma, you snitched on Freda's dad?

24:34.240 --> 24:36.275
Yeah, I snitched.

24:36.308 --> 24:37.443
So what? I snitched.

24:37.476 --> 24:38.945
I snitched.

24:38.978 --> 24:41.480
That was the only damn time
I ever snitched.

24:44.817 --> 24:47.520
And he ends up on--
in lock-up with our father.

24:50.256 --> 24:52.592
Ma, did Lucious have something
to do with his murder?

24:55.194 --> 24:59.131
That was a very
dangerous man, okay?

24:59.165 --> 25:01.300
He would've killed all of us,

25:01.333 --> 25:02.669
without batting an eye.

25:02.702 --> 25:05.304
And Freda?

25:05.337 --> 25:08.741
You know that apple
didn't fall far from the tree.

25:08.775 --> 25:10.810
So I need you to let her go,
Jamal.

25:10.843 --> 25:12.078
It's dangerous.

25:12.111 --> 25:15.247
For all of us, okay?

25:15.281 --> 25:17.349
Okay.

25:25.725 --> 25:28.027
Grandma?

25:28.060 --> 25:30.162
Hey, ready to go?
We're going
to the show.

25:30.196 --> 25:31.530
Yes, ma'am, but we
have to leave right now,

25:31.564 --> 25:33.666
before my father comes
home to get dressed.

25:33.700 --> 25:36.936
All right, Rhonda picked out
a beautiful gown for you.

25:36.969 --> 25:39.005
You can get dressed backstage
in the greenroom, okay?

25:39.038 --> 25:40.172
Let's go.

25:40.206 --> 25:41.373
Dwight doesn't
want me there?

25:41.407 --> 25:42.675
Oh, n-n-n-no,
he's just...

25:42.709 --> 25:43.843
He's very nervous,
that's all.

25:43.876 --> 25:45.077
It's a big night for him.

25:46.646 --> 25:47.880
Going somewhere?

25:49.716 --> 25:51.550
I'm gonna need your phone.

25:59.792 --> 26:01.794
A woman that beautiful

26:01.828 --> 26:03.095
shouldn't walk the
red carpet alone.

26:09.902 --> 26:12.038
You want my arm to fall off?

26:12.071 --> 26:15.241
(laughs)
Shut up, Billy Dee.

26:15.274 --> 26:17.710
I heard somebody needed
a date for the ASAs.

26:17.744 --> 26:22.048
Yeah, well, you know, Carol's
back drinking again, so...

26:22.081 --> 26:23.716
Well, Carol's more
of a plus one.

26:23.750 --> 26:25.718
Not a date.
(laughs)

26:25.752 --> 26:27.887
Baby?
Hmm?

26:27.920 --> 26:30.289
I got you something.

26:30.322 --> 26:32.224
What is that?

26:32.258 --> 26:33.626
A joke?

26:35.461 --> 26:36.729
Open it.

26:36.763 --> 26:38.397
Is this a trick?

26:38.430 --> 26:39.966
Open it.

26:41.433 --> 26:42.568
(screams)

26:42.601 --> 26:44.236
Oh, my...

26:44.270 --> 26:46.238
(chuckles)
Ooh-hoo-hoo! Ooh.

26:46.272 --> 26:47.406
Let me put it on you.

26:47.439 --> 26:48.607
This must have
been as much

26:48.641 --> 26:50.176
as a sports car, huh?

26:50.209 --> 26:51.610
A little more than a Ferrari

26:51.644 --> 26:53.112
but less than a Lamborghini.

26:53.145 --> 26:54.346
Oh, my.

26:54.380 --> 26:57.449
Look at that.

26:57.483 --> 27:00.687
Yeah, the way I see it,
tonight is our night, Cook.

27:00.720 --> 27:04.256
I mean, this is what
we dreamed about way back

27:04.290 --> 27:05.692
when we were selling CDs
out of the back

27:05.725 --> 27:07.593
of that old hooptie in Philly.

27:07.626 --> 27:11.197
Among other things
we were selling.

27:11.230 --> 27:12.531
I knew we'd get here,
I just didn't know

27:12.564 --> 27:13.766
it was gonna
take us this long.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.301
COOKIE:
See, you hear that?

27:15.334 --> 27:19.706
Yeah, I kind of like the
little riff, but the, um...

27:19.739 --> 27:21.808
...lyrics suck.
Lucious.

27:21.841 --> 27:24.811
The song is about a man
who's in love with a woman

27:24.844 --> 27:26.445
who don't love him back.

27:26.478 --> 27:28.815
I swear, I couldn't imagine
going with anyone but you.

27:30.649 --> 27:32.551
(chuckles)

27:32.584 --> 27:33.786
COOKIE:
Baby,

27:33.820 --> 27:36.455
this album... is gonna be big.

27:36.488 --> 27:37.790
I can feel it.

27:37.824 --> 27:38.958
Remember we used to have

27:38.991 --> 27:41.327
to duct-tape the
driver's side of the door

27:41.360 --> 27:43.329
so you wouldn't fall out?

27:43.362 --> 27:45.464
Oh, we was so
raggedy back then.
Yeah, and you'd talk

27:45.497 --> 27:48.334
about what you wanted to wear
and what you were gonna say.

27:48.367 --> 27:51.237
And you told me I couldn't
say nothing on the red carpet

27:51.270 --> 27:52.905
'cause I would
just sound stupid,

27:52.939 --> 27:54.573
so you was going
to do the talking.

27:54.606 --> 27:56.675
You was always saying
stupid stuff back then.

27:56.709 --> 28:00.112
Ain't nothing
changed, really.

28:01.447 --> 28:02.681
(both laugh)

28:05.184 --> 28:07.419
So, is that why
you're taking me?

28:07.453 --> 28:11.758
That and... I really miss
that booty of yours.

28:11.791 --> 28:13.993
Mm-hmm, I know you do.

28:14.026 --> 28:16.195
I know you're looking at it
while I'm walking away.

28:16.228 --> 28:17.663
I'm trying not to.

28:17.696 --> 28:18.664
(both laugh)

28:18.697 --> 28:20.867
You're such a flirt.

28:20.900 --> 28:22.501
LEAH:
Get off me.

28:22.534 --> 28:23.870
(grunts)

28:23.903 --> 28:25.104
What the hell are you doing?

28:25.137 --> 28:26.672
Just following the
boss man's orders.

28:26.705 --> 28:27.940
No disrespect, Andre.

28:27.974 --> 28:29.375
You, too, Granny.

28:29.408 --> 28:30.709
Come on.
Get 'em in there.

28:32.044 --> 28:34.346
Hey, at least you got
a TV in there.

28:34.380 --> 28:36.682
Daddy wanted you to be able
to watch the ASAs.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.017

REPORTER: The big story tonight
is the Lyons performing

30:05.137 --> 30:07.206
their brand-new Family Anthem.

30:07.239 --> 30:08.941
Can it live up to the
relentless hype?

30:08.975 --> 30:10.709
COOKIE:
What you will see
on that stage tonight

30:10.742 --> 30:12.778
is a real family.

30:12.811 --> 30:16.115
Yeah, see,
we're not the Brady Bunch,

30:16.148 --> 30:17.349
we're not the Partridges.

30:17.383 --> 30:18.617
Hell,
we ain't even the Jacksons.

30:18.650 --> 30:19.986
We are the Lyons.

30:45.177 --> 30:46.645
Yeah, Lucious may drive us all

30:46.678 --> 30:48.247
a little crazy
every now and again,

30:48.280 --> 30:49.648
but he's our king.

30:49.681 --> 30:51.350
And he's a genius.

30:51.383 --> 30:55.988
And he's the reason why we
are the first family of music.

REPORTER: We're here

31:06.232 --> 31:08.334
with Jamal Lyon,
who is the most

31:08.367 --> 31:10.269
nominated artist at the ASAs.

31:10.302 --> 31:12.004
Congratulations.
Thank you very much.

31:12.038 --> 31:14.040
So, Jamal, do you have a special
someone with you tonight?

31:14.073 --> 31:15.841
MAN:
Over here, man! D-Major!

31:15.874 --> 31:17.276
(photographers clamoring)

31:17.309 --> 31:18.544
Nah, not at all.

31:18.577 --> 31:20.279
I'm here all by myself
and proud of it.

31:20.312 --> 31:21.613
Well, I hear that you're working

31:21.647 --> 31:22.681
on the Black and White album.

31:22.714 --> 31:24.183
Care to share any
updates on that?

31:24.216 --> 31:25.517
Yes, I'm shelving it.

31:25.551 --> 31:27.286
The whole thing?

31:27.319 --> 31:29.055
Oh, it sounds like there's
trouble in the Lyon family.

31:29.088 --> 31:30.356
No, no. Come on, no.

31:30.389 --> 31:32.191
But I need to make
an album that's for me,

31:32.224 --> 31:33.459
not for my parents, so...

31:33.492 --> 31:35.027
y'all enjoy
tonight's performance.

31:35.061 --> 31:36.362
It's the last time you'll see
me onstage with my family.

31:36.395 --> 31:37.363
You heard it here first.

31:37.396 --> 31:38.364
What are you doing?

31:38.397 --> 31:42.134
* Ooh, babe, you got
a good thing coming *

Hey, yo, Mal.

31:51.277 --> 31:52.945
Yo, this is crazy.

31:52.979 --> 31:55.247
Everybody's shouting my name
like I'm a star or something.

31:55.281 --> 31:57.883
Well, you are
a star, Freda.
Mmm.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.551
Yo, after all this is done, um,

31:59.585 --> 32:01.887
we should talk
about you leaving Empire.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.490
I'll set you up with a new
label, new management.

32:04.523 --> 32:05.891
Everything. Ev-Every
label in the world's

32:05.924 --> 32:07.059
going to want you
after this, you know?

32:07.093 --> 32:08.160
Well, I'm good at Empire.

32:08.194 --> 32:09.895
What about our album?

32:09.928 --> 32:11.897
We good, all right?

32:11.930 --> 32:13.565
Trust me.

32:13.599 --> 32:14.900
Get away from Empire.

32:14.933 --> 32:16.402
* F-A-B-U-L-O-U-S

32:16.435 --> 32:17.769
* I'm fabulous

32:17.803 --> 32:19.338

32:19.371 --> 32:20.906
* I know, I know I'm fabulous

32:20.939 --> 32:22.141
* I know I'm fabulous

32:22.174 --> 32:24.443
* I know, I know I'm fabulous

32:24.476 --> 32:26.178
* I know I'm fabulous

32:26.212 --> 32:28.080
* I know, I know I'm fabulous

32:28.114 --> 32:30.082
* F-A-B-U-L-O-U-S

32:30.116 --> 32:31.950
* I'm fabulous.

32:31.984 --> 32:36.488
(applause and cheering)

32:44.330 --> 32:46.798
I'm so glad that my life story
is inspiring others.

32:46.832 --> 32:49.968
And if the pain
and despair that I suffered

32:50.002 --> 32:53.939
after losing my mother
to mental illness...

32:53.972 --> 32:56.942
if it helps one young boy feel
less alone in this world,

32:56.975 --> 32:58.610
then it's all worth it.

32:58.644 --> 33:00.312
Does he look fat?

33:00.346 --> 33:03.315
The TV adds ten pounds,
plus he broke his diet.

33:03.349 --> 33:05.384
Why does he have
a room like this?

33:05.417 --> 33:06.485
To lock people up?

33:06.518 --> 33:07.719
It's a panic room, Grandma.

33:07.753 --> 33:09.121
Security company installed it.

33:09.155 --> 33:11.390
Music gave me the strength
to keep going

33:11.423 --> 33:14.793
after my mother passed away,
and I believe...

33:14.826 --> 33:18.964
He promised he wouldn't
lock me up again.

33:18.997 --> 33:21.667
They should all know he's a liar

33:21.700 --> 33:24.002
and a promise-breaker.

33:24.036 --> 33:26.505
Listen to him
tell his lies out there.

33:28.006 --> 33:31.477
And so I'm dedicating
tonight to my mother.

33:31.510 --> 33:32.711
Thank you.

33:35.847 --> 33:39.485
* I might not make it,
I might not make it... *

33:39.518 --> 33:41.253
Okay, let me get
this straight.

33:41.287 --> 33:43.322
First, you two run
Empire together,

33:43.355 --> 33:45.157
and now you two are
on the red carpet tonight.

33:45.191 --> 33:46.658
Ugh.

33:46.692 --> 33:48.660
So, does this mean Cookie
and Lucious Lyon are...?

33:48.694 --> 33:49.861
CAROL:
Hey, Cookie!

33:50.696 --> 33:53.432
Hey, Cook! Hi Cookie!

33:53.465 --> 33:55.000
Excuse me, girl.

33:55.033 --> 33:56.668
A CEO's job
is never done.

33:56.702 --> 33:57.869
I'll be right back.

33:57.903 --> 33:59.037
(laughing)

33:59.071 --> 34:00.339
Hey, y'all know Empire

34:00.372 --> 34:01.940
started in my garage, right?

34:01.973 --> 34:03.609
Excuse me one sec.

34:03.642 --> 34:05.010
Loretha!
Hey, girl!

34:05.043 --> 34:06.545
Hey, good to see you.

34:06.578 --> 34:08.013
Come here. Hey.

34:08.046 --> 34:09.948
Carol, walk away.

34:09.981 --> 34:11.350
Okay? Walk away

34:11.383 --> 34:12.884
before I drag your drunk ass

34:12.918 --> 34:14.353
by your nappy weave.

34:14.386 --> 34:15.387
Okay?

34:15.421 --> 34:17.189
Okay?
(kissing sounds)

34:17.223 --> 34:18.390
You smell good.

34:18.424 --> 34:19.691
Thank you.
You look pretty.

34:19.725 --> 34:22.027
You, too. Go home.
Get home safely.
Okay.

34:22.060 --> 34:23.529
Make sure she leaves.

34:23.562 --> 34:25.364
Yeah.

34:25.397 --> 34:27.866
CAROL:
Hi, hi.
Let's go, get her out.

34:27.899 --> 34:29.568
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

34:29.601 --> 34:31.069
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Freda, Freda!

34:31.103 --> 34:33.372
CAROL:
Oh, Freda! (cheers)

34:33.405 --> 34:35.474
Oh, my gosh. Hi, Freda.

34:35.507 --> 34:37.976
I always thought you were
so cute and talented.
Thank you, Miss Carol.

34:38.009 --> 34:39.378
You all right?
Um, yeah, yeah.

34:39.411 --> 34:40.646
You need me to
call you a Uber?

34:40.679 --> 34:41.747
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no,

34:41.780 --> 34:43.081
but you know what I need
for you to do?

34:43.115 --> 34:45.217
I need for you to escort
me up in this place

34:45.251 --> 34:46.418
so I can get Lucious'
people off my tail.

34:46.452 --> 34:48.654
I got more press to do.
You got press to do?

34:48.687 --> 34:50.556
What you talking about,
you got more press to do?
Yeah, I got more press.

34:50.589 --> 34:52.658
You think you're better
than me or something, huh?
Come on.

34:52.691 --> 34:53.925
You know what?
You wouldn't even be here

34:53.959 --> 34:55.161
if Lucious didn't feel guilty

34:55.194 --> 34:56.728
about what he did to your daddy.

34:56.762 --> 34:57.896
SECURITY GUARD:
This way, please.

34:57.929 --> 35:00.332
Come on, let's go.
Yeah, hood rat.

35:00.366 --> 35:02.168
Your daddy.

35:02.201 --> 35:03.735
Get your hands off me.

35:03.769 --> 35:06.004
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

35:06.037 --> 35:08.340
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

35:08.374 --> 35:10.342
* Boom, boom, boom, boom...

35:10.376 --> 35:12.644
FREDA:
* They askin',
"Why you do that, baby?" *

35:12.678 --> 35:15.314
* I'm wildin' on the block,
like, "Why you do that, baby?" *

35:15.347 --> 35:18.116
* They wonder...
* I like the way you rhyme
and how you grew that daisy. *

35:19.117 --> 35:20.786
That's your little girl?

35:20.819 --> 35:22.421
Yeah, that's my girl.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.089
CAROL: Your daddy.
LUCIOUS: Name was Frank Gathers.

35:24.122 --> 35:25.424
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Lucious Lyon!

35:25.457 --> 35:26.592
You and me,
we cut from the same tree.

35:26.625 --> 35:27.859
Lucious Lyon!

35:27.893 --> 35:29.261
Okay, uh, where's Andre?

35:29.295 --> 35:31.263
Um, I think he's in
there with Rhonda.

35:31.297 --> 35:32.498
I saw her go in.
She was looking for him,

35:32.531 --> 35:33.765
but she couldn't find him.
COOKIE: No.

35:33.799 --> 35:34.633
Okay, well, n-n-n-no,

35:34.666 --> 35:35.934
no family picture
until we get...

35:35.967 --> 35:37.369
(screaming)

35:37.403 --> 35:39.104
(gunshot)
LUCIOUS: Come on.

35:39.137 --> 35:41.607
Your father didn't want this
for you. Let me help you.

35:41.640 --> 35:42.874
LUCIOUS:
He loved you so much

35:42.908 --> 35:44.776
that if
you cut off his right arm,

35:44.810 --> 35:47.513
he'd reach over and hug you
with his left one.

35:47.546 --> 35:48.947
CAROL:
You wouldn't even be here
if Lucious

35:48.980 --> 35:51.283
didn't feel guilty about
what he did to your daddy.

35:51.317 --> 35:52.951
LUCIOUS:
What the hell
your daddy do to you?

35:52.984 --> 35:54.152
Lucious has been like a father
to me, you know that.

35:54.186 --> 35:55.887
HAKEEM:
And you think that's
a good thing.

35:55.921 --> 35:56.888
Just brace yourself
for when he abandons you, too.

35:56.922 --> 35:58.290
Get away from Empire.

35:58.324 --> 35:59.991
Stay away from that man.

36:19.110 --> 36:20.145
(grunts)

36:20.178 --> 36:22.348
(screaming)

36:29.288 --> 36:30.422
No, no, no.
Stop, Freda, no!

36:30.456 --> 36:32.291
(gunshot)
(screaming)

36:36.528 --> 36:38.430
Get the gun!

36:38.464 --> 36:40.666
Lucious? Are you hit?

36:40.699 --> 36:42.000
I'm okay. She missed.

36:42.033 --> 36:44.202
Mom! Mom!

36:44.236 --> 36:45.671
(screaming)

36:45.704 --> 36:46.838
Jamal!

36:46.872 --> 36:49.007
Call...
boy, why you standing there?

36:49.040 --> 36:49.941
Jamal.

36:49.975 --> 36:51.042
Okay.

36:51.076 --> 36:52.778
Jamal, Jamal. Look at me.

36:52.811 --> 36:54.446
You gonna be all right, okay?

36:54.480 --> 36:55.514
(sobbing)
No, no, no!

36:55.547 --> 36:56.515
Say something.

36:56.548 --> 36:57.849
Let's go.

36:57.883 --> 36:59.017
Jamal, you're
gonna make it.

36:59.050 --> 37:01.520
Oh, God, no, please!

37:01.553 --> 37:03.355
Wake up, boy.
Say something.

37:03.389 --> 37:05.524
Say something...

37:05.557 --> 37:07.926
No, no, no, no, no, no...

37:14.566 --> 37:16.034
Hey, Thirsty!

37:16.067 --> 37:18.737
Open the damn door, man. Let me
out of here. It's my brother!

37:18.770 --> 37:20.306
As we reported at the top
of the program,

37:20.339 --> 37:21.707
this year's ASA ceremony
was canceled...

37:21.740 --> 37:22.974
Thirsty!

37:23.008 --> 37:24.710
...for the first time ever in...

37:24.743 --> 37:25.877
Open the door, Thirsty!

37:25.911 --> 37:27.413
Come on, man!

37:27.446 --> 37:29.881
Superstar Jamal Lyon

37:29.915 --> 37:32.150
was tragically shot
on the red carpet.

37:32.183 --> 37:34.720
According to eyewitness
testimony from the carpet,

37:34.753 --> 37:36.422
the horrific shooting
was committed

37:36.455 --> 37:37.989
by another Empire artist,

37:38.023 --> 37:40.091
upstart rapper Freda Gathers,

37:40.125 --> 37:42.728
who goes by the stage name
Freda Gatz.
(moaning)

37:42.761 --> 37:44.730
Freda was plucked from obscurity

37:44.763 --> 37:47.899
by Empire CEO Lucious Lyon
earlier this year,

37:47.933 --> 37:49.735
and was quickly labeled
his prodigy

37:49.768 --> 37:50.936
and the face of Empire's

37:50.969 --> 37:52.404
revived Gutter Life imprint.

37:52.438 --> 37:53.739
Oh, my God.
(phone buzzing)

37:53.772 --> 37:55.507
Sources indicate
that in recent weeks,

37:55.541 --> 37:57.609
Freda had grown closer
to her victim,

37:57.643 --> 38:01.313
even collaborating
on new tracks with him.

38:01.347 --> 38:02.614
PARAMEDIC:
26 year-old black male,

38:02.648 --> 38:03.949
gunshot wound
to the stomach.

38:03.982 --> 38:05.784
No exit wound, might
be internal bleeding.
Prep OR 2.

38:05.817 --> 38:07.085
Mom, I'm okay, Mom.
I'm all right.

38:07.118 --> 38:08.420
Keep-- Jamal, keep your eyes
open. Look at me!

38:08.454 --> 38:09.588
Don't you take your
eyes off me, boy.

38:09.621 --> 38:11.022
Open your eyes.

38:11.056 --> 38:12.824
What happened?
Where's Dad?
I'm here. I'm fine.

38:12.858 --> 38:14.426
He's fine. He's fine.
You take care of my boy.

38:14.460 --> 38:16.027
DOCTOR:
We need more A-positive stat.

38:16.061 --> 38:17.529
Jamal, you're going to be fine.

38:17.563 --> 38:18.930
Doctors-- they're just
gonna patch you back up.

38:18.964 --> 38:20.198
DOCTOR:
We don't have time to wait.
(monitor beeping)

38:20.231 --> 38:21.299
Get him for surgery.
Let's move, people!

38:21.333 --> 38:22.601
Now! Now!
No, no, no, Jamal!

38:22.634 --> 38:24.436
I'm sorry, this is as
far as you can go.

38:24.470 --> 38:25.437
I got to go...

38:25.471 --> 38:26.972
Take them to Surgical Waiting.

38:27.005 --> 38:29.107
Cookie, it's gonna be...
Get your hands off of me.

38:29.140 --> 38:30.976
This is your fault,
you son of a...

38:31.009 --> 38:33.545
Hey! Put them damn cameras down!

38:33.579 --> 38:34.780
Put them down!

38:34.813 --> 38:37.649
Hasn't he given
you enough already?

38:37.683 --> 38:38.784
LUCIOUS:
Cookie.

38:38.817 --> 38:40.118
(crying):
Don't you touch me.

38:40.151 --> 38:42.020
Get out of the way, Lucious.

38:43.522 --> 38:46.224
REPORTER:
Freda's since been taken
into police custody.

38:46.257 --> 38:47.793
Let's get to your family.

38:47.826 --> 38:49.227
So far
no motive has been revealed.

38:49.260 --> 38:52.631
According to reports,
Jamal Lyon is undergoing
Let's go.

38:52.664 --> 38:55.601
emergency surgery and remains
in critical condition.

38:57.369 --> 39:00.138
Superstar Jamal Lyon
was tragically shot

39:00.171 --> 39:01.740
on the red carpet.

39:01.773 --> 39:03.409
If you're just tuning
into the program,

39:03.442 --> 39:05.844
we are saddened to report
that beloved musician

39:05.877 --> 39:07.813
Jamal Lyon has been shot...

39:07.846 --> 39:09.147
Excuse me.

39:09.180 --> 39:10.315
Do you have any news yet?

39:10.348 --> 39:11.517
No, ma'am.

39:11.550 --> 39:12.851
They'll let you know.
You said that

39:12.884 --> 39:14.853
30 minutes ago.

39:14.886 --> 39:16.855
(crying):
I'm sorry.

39:16.888 --> 39:18.156
Ma.
What?

39:18.189 --> 39:20.358
That's my baby.

39:20.392 --> 39:22.193
That evil bitch
shot my baby.

39:22.227 --> 39:23.595
She shot at Lucious.

39:23.629 --> 39:26.432
And Jamal just stepped
in front of the bullet.

39:26.465 --> 39:27.499
Come on, Mom.

39:27.533 --> 39:29.535
ANDRE:
How is he?

39:29.568 --> 39:31.102
How is he?
RHONDA: There you are.

39:31.136 --> 39:33.004
How's Jamal?
Sit down.

39:33.038 --> 39:34.940
COOKIE:
He's...

39:34.973 --> 39:36.374
(crying):
He's still in surgery,

39:36.408 --> 39:37.843
and they're not
telling us anything.

39:37.876 --> 39:39.678
Dre, they're not
telling us anything.

39:39.711 --> 39:40.946
RHONDA:
Where were you?

39:40.979 --> 39:42.514
I was looking
everywhere for you.

39:42.548 --> 39:44.683
Look, not now, okay, babe?

39:44.716 --> 39:46.051
I can't believe they're
giving an ASA update.

39:46.084 --> 39:47.352
TV ANNOUNCER:
ASA for Rapper of the Year

39:47.385 --> 39:49.855
goes to... Skrills.

39:49.888 --> 39:52.691
Finally we come
to the big prize,

39:52.724 --> 39:55.894
the ASA for Best Song
of the Year.

39:57.496 --> 39:59.465
COOKIE:
Please, come on.
We need a reason to smile.

39:59.498 --> 40:01.533
Jamal, come on.

40:01.567 --> 40:04.936
The ASA for Best Song
of the Year goes to...

40:06.672 --> 40:09.040
"Dreaming" by P.O.C.

40:09.074 --> 40:10.141
(groans)
ANNOUNCER: Thank you.

40:10.175 --> 40:12.544
HAKEEM:
They split the votes.

40:12.578 --> 40:13.812
All that fighting,
you and Jamal.

40:13.845 --> 40:15.080
For what? Nothing?

40:26.424 --> 40:28.393
TARIQ:
Carol Hardaway's a wreck.
She won't be

40:28.426 --> 40:29.561
a reliable witness.
We should
still press her.

40:29.595 --> 40:30.762
I don't want to
do that to her,

40:30.796 --> 40:32.330
and besides,
I don't need her.

40:32.363 --> 40:34.399
What happened tonight at the
ASAs, that wasn't random.

40:34.432 --> 40:36.568
It touches right on the nerve
of what I've been building on.

40:36.602 --> 40:39.104
Bodies were dropping under
Lucious Lyon 20 years ago.

40:39.137 --> 40:42.007
Bunkie Campbell told someone
he murdered four drug dealers.

40:42.040 --> 40:43.408
Are you gonna bring
me something big?

40:43.441 --> 40:44.743
Always, but you know
how I like to work.

40:44.776 --> 40:46.411
I like to put things
together carefully.

40:46.444 --> 40:49.447
Lucious Lyon's ex-fiancé,
pregnant by his son, Hakeem.

40:49.481 --> 40:50.916
And she's willing to talk?

40:50.949 --> 40:52.951
Not yet, but I'm
planning to persuade her.

41:04.963 --> 41:06.932
(siren wailing)

41:06.965 --> 41:09.935
Anybody want coffee?

41:09.968 --> 41:11.269
I'll take one.

41:11.302 --> 41:13.572
I'll go with you.

41:15.306 --> 41:18.176
HAKEEM:
I guess we're on
snack patrol now.

41:18.209 --> 41:20.211
Huh?
(chuckles)

41:22.480 --> 41:25.483
(sighs)

41:37.162 --> 41:39.197
You mind if I sit down?

41:46.838 --> 41:49.975
Damn, Cookie.

41:50.008 --> 41:53.945
If you heard the things
I said to Jamal.

41:55.681 --> 41:59.484
Maybe it would've been better
if my mama had drowned me.

41:59.517 --> 42:00.919
Stop.

42:00.952 --> 42:03.822
You were born into
a living hell.

42:03.855 --> 42:06.491
That you can't help.

42:06.524 --> 42:09.527
But I know, deep down,

42:09.561 --> 42:12.698
you want to do what's
right for your family.

42:15.901 --> 42:18.003
I know it.

42:18.036 --> 42:20.105
Mr. and Mrs. Lyon?

42:22.307 --> 42:23.842
(overlapping chatter)

42:23.875 --> 42:25.043
(siren wailing)

42:28.580 --> 42:30.682
Some are saying tonight's
incident is more proof

42:30.716 --> 42:33.051
that hip-hop culture
breeds violence.

42:33.084 --> 42:35.286
But now, could Jamal Lyon end up
paying for it with his life?

42:35.320 --> 42:39.357
...citing privacy concerns,
but we'll remain on the scene...

42:39.390 --> 42:40.792
...by Freda Gathers,
seems to be a message...

42:40.826 --> 42:43.028
REPORTER:
Look! Someone just came outside.

42:43.061 --> 42:44.896
REPORTER 2: Who is she?
REPORTER 3: Excuse me.

42:44.930 --> 42:46.865
Excuse me. Excuse me, ma'am.

42:46.898 --> 42:49.067
(reporters clamoring)

42:49.100 --> 42:52.003
Is there any news
about Jamal?

42:57.408 --> 42:59.645
Are you part
of the family, ma'am?

42:59.678 --> 43:02.213
Do you have any news
about Jamal Lyon's condition?

43:02.247 --> 43:05.216
Yes, I am part of the family.

43:05.250 --> 43:07.285
