Lyle, you got your jacket?

00:09.210 --> 00:11.695
Mom, I know how to dress
for a football game.

00:11.746 --> 00:13.797
You know, whenever we get
there, you're always cold.

00:13.865 --> 00:15.198
He's ok.
Where are the tickets?

00:15.250 --> 00:16.250
I thought you got them.

00:16.334 --> 00:18.051
You said you grabbed them.

00:18.136 --> 00:19.520

you guys would be lost.

You know your daughter.

01:20.281 --> 01:22.766
She probably just wants to talk about
a new dress she bought.

01:33.945 --> 01:36.046
I'm in so much trouble.

01:36.113 --> 01:37.998
I know you taught me
to not be afraid,

01:38.082 --> 01:41.284
but I'm so afraid.

01:41.336 --> 01:44.054
When you get this message...

01:44.121 --> 01:47.224
I'll probably be dead.

01:47.291 --> 01:50.877
So I just wanted
to tell you that...

01:50.945 --> 01:53.797

I mean, between writer's block

02:16.921 --> 02:19.790
and my neighbor's construction,
I'm going crazy here.

02:19.841 --> 02:20.991
What's going on there?

02:21.042 --> 02:23.343
I just got a call.
The bodies of two young women

02:23.428 --> 02:26.346
were found in the Elden Street area
in Bristol, Virginia.

02:26.431 --> 02:29.850
They were both tortured
and electrocuted.

02:29.934 --> 02:31.718
Did they make any phone calls?

02:31.803 --> 02:34.304
Yes. But without
the signature.

02:37.442 --> 02:39.726
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

[Footsteps approaching]

Is that Ellie again?

03:22.904 --> 03:25.605
She texts me every morning
on her way to school.

03:25.690 --> 03:27.024
How's she doing?

03:27.075 --> 03:30.027
Well, she's already got
herself a bff named Jill,

03:30.078 --> 03:32.195
and she thinks
she wants to play soccer.

03:32.246 --> 03:33.864
She's adjusting.
That's good.

03:33.915 --> 03:37.284
Bristol, Virginia.
The body of 25-year-old Jenny Delilly

03:37.368 --> 03:39.202
was found yesterday.

03:39.253 --> 03:41.872
She had been tortured,
sodomized, and electrocuted

03:41.923 --> 03:44.875
before being forced to make
a goodbye call to her parents.

03:44.926 --> 03:46.710
Her body was then dumped
off Elden Street.

03:46.761 --> 03:48.795
A week ago, the body
of Kara Kirkland

03:48.880 --> 03:51.298
was found in the same area
having suffered identical injuries.

03:51.382 --> 03:53.216
This reminds me
of the butcher case.

03:53.250 --> 03:55.418
Why does that name
sound familiar to me?

03:55.470 --> 03:58.588
The butcher was a sexual sadist
that killed 20 women

03:58.639 --> 04:00.607
in the same area of Virginia
from 1984 to 1993

04:00.691 --> 04:01.925
and then vanished.

04:01.976 --> 04:03.810
He tortured blond women
in their 20s

04:03.895 --> 04:05.262
that lived in or near
Bristol.

04:05.329 --> 04:07.981
That was one of Rossi's
old cases, isn't it?

04:08.049 --> 04:09.933
Does he know?
Yes.

04:09.984 --> 04:12.602
[Footsteps approaching]

04:12.653 --> 04:14.270
Some vacation.

04:14.322 --> 04:15.438

04:15.490 --> 04:17.491
I never got any anything.

04:17.575 --> 04:20.243
Prentiss: Do you think
the butcher's back?

04:20.293 --> 04:22.796
I doubt it.
We profiled him as a white male

04:22.864 --> 04:24.931
in his late 40s
back then.

04:24.999 --> 04:27.300
He'd be in his 70s
by now.

04:27.385 --> 04:29.119
Didn't you almost catch him?

04:29.187 --> 04:31.621
In the spring of '93,
we narrowed the geographical profile.

04:31.672 --> 04:34.257
We alerted every blonde
in their mid-20s

04:34.325 --> 04:36.292
in Bristol and the
surrounding counties.

04:36.344 --> 04:40.180
The pressure got so intense,
the killings just stopped.

04:40.264 --> 04:41.798
Well, the Copelands
killed into their 70s.

04:41.849 --> 04:43.133
This could be him
coming back.

04:43.184 --> 04:44.467
It's probably a copycat.

04:44.519 --> 04:45.852
If he's emulating
the butcher,

04:45.937 --> 04:47.437
he could just be
getting started.

05:37.616 --> 05:40.901
"remembrance of things past
is not necessarily

05:40.952 --> 05:44.455
the remembrance of things
as they were."

05:44.539 --> 05:46.741
All right, let's go over
victimology.

05:46.792 --> 05:50.110
Both Jenny Delilly and
Kara Kirkman were single

05:50.162 --> 05:51.245
professional women.

05:51.296 --> 05:53.080
Jenny had just gotten a job
as a Web designer,

05:53.131 --> 05:55.916
and Kara worked
for a nonprofit.

05:55.967 --> 05:57.668
Each woman was taken
from a populated area

05:57.753 --> 05:58.769
with no witnesses.

05:58.837 --> 06:00.838
Jenny from a crowded
drugstore parking lot,

06:00.922 --> 06:03.924
Kara from the back patio
of a ground-floor apartment

06:03.975 --> 06:06.260
when he roommate went inside
to answer the phone.

06:06.311 --> 06:07.678
Why not take
the roommate?

06:07.763 --> 06:09.814
She's brunette.
He prefers blondes.

06:09.898 --> 06:11.982
These vics were forced
to make phone calls.

06:12.050 --> 06:14.985
Jenny left a message,
and Kara spoke with her fiancé.

06:15.070 --> 06:16.854
Garcia, were you able
to trace the calls?

06:16.938 --> 06:19.523
My pretties, they're using disposable cells,
so I'm coming up empty.

06:19.608 --> 06:20.858
We do have
a timeline, though.

06:20.942 --> 06:22.093
According to
the M.E.'s report,

06:22.160 --> 06:23.694
both victims were dead
for about 3 hours

06:23.779 --> 06:25.413
before they were found,
which means based upon

06:25.480 --> 06:26.664
the times of their messages,

06:26.732 --> 06:28.666
they endured 5 additional
hours of torture

06:28.734 --> 06:30.334
after making
their goodbye calls.

06:30.419 --> 06:32.920
It wasn't enough that he caused
his victims pain and suffering,

06:32.987 --> 06:34.955
it extended to their parents
as well?

06:35.006 --> 06:36.874
Rossi,
were the phone calls

06:36.958 --> 06:39.043
the butcher made his
victims leave similar?

06:39.127 --> 06:40.578
Yeah, but the content varied.

06:40.645 --> 06:44.048
13 vics left answering machine
messages for loved ones,

06:44.116 --> 06:46.901
5 actually talked to someone
before they died,

06:46.968 --> 06:49.053
and two reached no one.

06:49.137 --> 06:51.021
But didn't the butcher
make his victims

06:51.106 --> 06:53.441
end their messages by
saying they were enjoying it?

06:53.508 --> 06:54.558
That was the signature.

06:54.643 --> 06:56.560
Wouldn't that make
a sadist flaccid?

06:56.645 --> 06:57.812
It wasn't about him.

06:57.863 --> 06:59.346
It was about the parents.

06:59.397 --> 07:01.181
He wanted to make sure
that they knew

07:01.233 --> 07:03.350
he had complete
control and dominance

07:03.401 --> 07:04.969
over their daughters.

07:05.036 --> 07:06.520
All right, Morgan and Prentiss,
go to the M.E.

07:06.571 --> 07:08.489
We need to compare ritual
and M.O.

07:08.540 --> 07:10.374
Rossi, Reid, and I
will interview the families

07:10.459 --> 07:12.460
and go over the messages.

07:12.527 --> 07:14.078
Rossi, what's in the box?

07:16.748 --> 07:19.083
Evil.

07:24.005 --> 07:25.706
This isn't the butcher,
believe me.

07:25.757 --> 07:27.708
We need a room with
a whiteboard, a window,

07:27.759 --> 07:28.876
and 5 chairs.

07:28.927 --> 07:30.377
Unless the butcher's
Jack Lalanne,

07:30.428 --> 07:31.595
this is a younger copycat.

07:31.680 --> 07:33.547
The bodies were left
in the exact same location.

07:33.615 --> 07:35.583
Everybody knew
the details of this case.

07:35.650 --> 07:37.384
The paper even printed part of
the answering machine messages.

07:37.435 --> 07:38.886
Have you been able
to step up police presence

07:38.937 --> 07:40.220
on Elden Street?

07:40.272 --> 07:41.889
Well, it's a 7-mile stretch
that runs through the city.

07:41.940 --> 07:43.507
I've done what I could
considering our budget.

07:43.575 --> 07:45.392
Are detectives Clemmons,
Benton, and Gallagher still here?

07:45.443 --> 07:46.861
They worked the first case.

07:46.912 --> 07:48.662
Clemmons and Benton
both died 2 years ago.

07:48.730 --> 07:50.063
Gallagher retired from the force

07:50.115 --> 07:52.065
when his wife was killed
at the Pentagon on 9/11.

07:52.117 --> 07:53.784
So you're the lead
Detective on this?

07:53.869 --> 07:55.736
Unfortunately. Look,
the families of the victims

07:55.787 --> 07:57.171
should be here any minute.

07:57.238 --> 07:59.006
If there's anything I can do
to help you guys, let me know.

07:59.073 --> 08:00.291
Thank you.

08:01.293 --> 08:02.843
You can tell
from the burn wounds

08:02.911 --> 08:05.880
that they were assaulted with
an electrified object.

08:05.931 --> 08:07.515
Curling iron? Poker?

08:07.582 --> 08:08.799
Inconclusive.

08:08.884 --> 08:11.919
They also have numerous
lacerations on their bodies.

08:11.987 --> 08:14.755
Slight ones near the throat,
deep ones on the chest.

08:14.806 --> 08:15.890
Multiple knives.

08:15.941 --> 08:17.525
The guy was creative.

08:17.592 --> 08:19.026
Creatively sick.

08:19.093 --> 08:21.478
What about the contusions
on the backs of their heads?

08:21.563 --> 08:23.764
They were most likely
sustained during the abduction.

08:23.815 --> 08:26.433
This is a different approach
than the butcher's abductions.

08:26.484 --> 08:28.485
Based on Rossi's profile,
the butcher was a smooth-talker

08:28.570 --> 08:30.938
who lured his victims
without initial physical force.

08:30.989 --> 08:32.438
Yet clearly
this unsub doesn't have

08:32.490 --> 08:34.107
the same confidence
or finesse.

08:34.159 --> 08:35.442
He's sloppy.

08:35.510 --> 08:37.044
You're welcome.
Thank you.

08:52.126 --> 08:54.595
Hey, Colby.

08:54.646 --> 08:55.763
How have you been?

08:56.898 --> 08:59.800
I, uh, I got a job
at Joe's coffee.

08:59.851 --> 09:01.068
You should come by
sometime.

09:01.135 --> 09:02.903
Sounds good.

09:03.905 --> 09:05.439
I'm hungry.

09:08.944 --> 09:10.294
How's he doing?

09:10.362 --> 09:12.646
What, am I talking
to myself?

09:13.999 --> 09:16.250
I should go.

09:22.424 --> 09:24.508
If I had a good caretaker,
he'd be here on time.

09:24.593 --> 09:25.993
I don't pay you
to be late.

09:26.044 --> 09:26.994
I'm coming.

09:27.045 --> 09:28.662
That's what you said
an hour ago.

09:28.713 --> 09:32.349
I should've gotten rid
of you when I had a chance.

09:32.434 --> 09:35.719
The old girl would have
Fed me by now.

09:39.107 --> 09:41.225
She was so scared.

09:41.309 --> 09:43.544
I'm sorry I have to ask you
to do this.

09:43.612 --> 09:48.032
Mom, dad, this is Jenny.

09:50.068 --> 09:51.652
I'm in trouble.

09:51.703 --> 09:54.455
I kept asking her
what was wrong, but...

09:56.574 --> 09:59.209
She just made me listen.

09:59.277 --> 10:01.161
Jenny:
I'm in so much trouble.

10:01.212 --> 10:04.932
I know you taught me
to not be afraid, but I'm so afraid.

10:06.701 --> 10:09.837
When you get this message,
I'll probably be dead.

10:09.888 --> 10:13.507
So I just wanted
to tell you that...

10:13.558 --> 10:15.926
Did your fiancee
say anything

10:16.011 --> 10:18.762
that sounded
out of the ordinary?

10:18.847 --> 10:20.764
No.

10:22.150 --> 10:24.885
She sounded like herself, considering
the circumstances.

10:24.936 --> 10:28.555
You say that her lexical features are
consistent with her vernacular?

10:28.606 --> 10:30.624
Huh?

10:30.692 --> 10:33.110
Are the words hers?

10:33.194 --> 10:35.729
Yeah, that's what she said.

10:35.780 --> 10:38.749
I need to ask you about
the words that Jenny used.

10:38.817 --> 10:41.085
Does it sound like something
that she would say?

10:41.169 --> 10:43.070
Does she sound like herself?

10:45.006 --> 10:48.759
We never--we never told her
to not be afraid.

10:48.843 --> 10:51.545
Why would she say that?

10:51.596 --> 10:53.597
She wouldn't.

10:55.817 --> 10:57.751
At the end
of the conversation,

10:57.819 --> 11:00.087
did Kara...

11:00.138 --> 11:02.940
Say that she enjoyed it?

11:03.024 --> 11:06.477
No, she didn't say
she enjoyed it.

11:08.980 --> 11:10.864
What are you guys
not telling me?

11:12.484 --> 11:14.651
I need some air.

11:21.493 --> 11:22.576
What happened in there?

11:22.627 --> 11:24.044
We talked about
the signature.

11:24.112 --> 11:25.579
Even though
Jenny Delilly's message

11:25.630 --> 11:28.115
didn't have the whole signature,
I want you to see if it matches

11:28.166 --> 11:29.967
any of the old butcher
phone transcripts.

11:30.051 --> 11:31.635
You think something in
Jenny's call was scripted?

11:31.720 --> 11:33.303
Possibly.

11:41.980 --> 11:45.349
Baldwin softball field.

11:45.417 --> 11:46.934
Good. Very good.

11:48.553 --> 11:50.270
Heritage Mall.

11:50.338 --> 11:51.438
Very good.

11:52.674 --> 11:55.526
Gas station
off West State.

11:55.610 --> 11:57.711
No. No, try again.

11:57.779 --> 11:59.813
It's the one off West State.

11:59.864 --> 12:01.331
It's ok if you don't
remember.

12:03.001 --> 12:06.253
Don't tell me
I don't remember.

12:06.320 --> 12:08.705
Let's just try another one.

12:08.790 --> 12:12.459
You're trying to make me
look stupid. I'm not stupid.

12:12.510 --> 12:14.912
No one said you were stupid.

12:14.979 --> 12:17.047
You just...You gotta
keep practicing.

12:17.115 --> 12:19.633
I know a better way
to practice.

12:19.684 --> 12:21.718
It's not time.

12:21.803 --> 12:25.055
It's time
when I say it's time.

12:25.123 --> 12:28.058
I want to go out.

12:28.143 --> 12:30.527
Take me out.

12:37.152 --> 12:38.902
All right.

12:38.987 --> 12:41.538
This is right where
she parked her car.

12:41.623 --> 12:44.324
And then she rushed in there
to get a prescription.

12:44.375 --> 12:46.243
Then she comes back to her car

12:46.327 --> 12:49.029
and somebody
gets her attention.

12:49.080 --> 12:50.363
They call out to her.

12:50.415 --> 12:52.249
She throws her stuff
in the trunk,

12:52.333 --> 12:54.084
runs off that way,
and that's when we lose her.

12:54.169 --> 12:56.870
So how do you snatch
someone from here?

12:56.921 --> 12:58.538
Push her into a car?

12:58.590 --> 12:59.756
It's way too crowded.

12:59.841 --> 13:03.560
But there is a blind spot
right there.

13:07.348 --> 13:09.216
There's enough of
an obstruction here

13:09.267 --> 13:11.051
to park your car,

13:11.102 --> 13:12.552
blitz her from behind,

13:12.604 --> 13:14.021
and then push her
into the vehicle.

13:14.072 --> 13:15.522
But could you
do that alone?

13:15.573 --> 13:16.773
I doubt it.

13:16.858 --> 13:18.892
And two people would explain
how the first victim

13:18.943 --> 13:20.393
was abducted so quickly
from the patio

13:20.445 --> 13:22.229
when her roommate
went in to get the phone.

13:22.280 --> 13:24.498
It would also shed light
on the M.E.'s findings.

13:24.565 --> 13:26.450
There wasn't one unsub
with two knives,

13:26.534 --> 13:28.202
it was two unsubs with
their own weapon.

13:28.253 --> 13:30.537
Woman: Please tell mom
I love her.

13:30.588 --> 13:32.456
Tell Joey the same.

13:32.524 --> 13:35.242
He wants me to say
I enjoyed it, but I didn't.

13:35.293 --> 13:36.860
Man: Yes, she did. She's dead.

13:36.928 --> 13:38.545
He doesn't even
sound human.

13:38.613 --> 13:40.547
Did you transfer
all the tapes yourself?

13:40.598 --> 13:43.183
17 years ago he sounded
like background noise,

13:43.251 --> 13:44.935
but when I digitized them,

13:45.019 --> 13:46.436
you could hear every word.

13:47.438 --> 13:48.922
Yes, she did. She's dead.

13:48.973 --> 13:51.024
It's stunningly creepy.

13:51.092 --> 13:52.592
I never caught the butcher,

13:52.644 --> 13:54.261
but I caught his voice.

13:54.312 --> 13:56.897
I'd go to bed hearing him,
wake up hearing him.

13:56.948 --> 13:58.732
It would be like hearing a message
from Jack the Ripper.

13:58.783 --> 14:00.367
Why haven't you
ever written about him?

14:00.434 --> 14:03.937
He had too much power.
I need to find him first.

14:03.988 --> 14:07.708
Mom, dad, this is Susan.
I'm in trouble.

14:07.775 --> 14:09.209
I'm in so much trouble.

14:09.277 --> 14:13.046
I know you taught me
never to be afraid, but I am so afraid.

14:13.114 --> 14:14.164
What number was she?

14:14.249 --> 14:16.717
Number 20. Susan Cole.

14:16.784 --> 14:19.419
His last victim.

14:19.470 --> 14:22.005
Jenny Delilly's message didn't
match any old victims' messages

14:22.090 --> 14:24.841
until we get to Susan Cole,
the butcher's last kill.

14:24.926 --> 14:26.343
Their messages
were identical,

14:26.427 --> 14:27.895
minus the line
about enjoying it,

14:27.962 --> 14:29.129
the butcher's
signature.

14:29.180 --> 14:30.964
Reid: The victimologies
are similar, too.

14:31.015 --> 14:32.465
What did the M.E. say?

14:32.517 --> 14:34.935
Multiple wounds from
two separate knives on each victim.

14:34.986 --> 14:37.404
There's no way Jenny Delilly was
abducted by one person.

14:37.471 --> 14:39.072
So two knives
and two unsubs?

14:39.140 --> 14:40.357
He couldn't
take Jenny alone.

14:40.425 --> 14:41.909
When you look
at Kara's patio

14:41.976 --> 14:44.244
and the fact that the roommate went
inside for two seconds,

14:44.312 --> 14:45.645
it's highly unlikely.

14:45.697 --> 14:46.780
So what are you saying?

14:46.831 --> 14:48.615
We're looking
for a team.

14:52.337 --> 14:54.371
Miss.

14:54.455 --> 14:56.323
Miss, I need your help.

14:56.374 --> 14:57.708
My caretaker
had a heart attack.

14:57.792 --> 14:59.176
Please,
you gotta help me.

14:59.260 --> 15:00.510
Oh, my God. Where is he?

15:05.883 --> 15:07.134
Sir--

15:18.079 --> 15:20.897
look at her lips.

15:22.317 --> 15:24.318
She's pretty.

15:26.988 --> 15:29.189
Don't worry.

15:29.240 --> 15:32.659
We're gonna tell you
exactly what to say.

15:36.631 --> 15:39.466
Everything's gonna end
all right.

15:51.017 --> 15:51.933
Heather Langley.

15:52.018 --> 15:53.752
She lives nearby.

15:53.803 --> 15:55.253
Third body in a week.

15:55.304 --> 15:57.922
I got additional units
patrolling the area, but it's too big.

15:57.974 --> 16:00.759
The unsubs fit into the community.
They go unnoticed.

16:00.810 --> 16:02.927
This is the exact
same place Susan Cole,

16:02.979 --> 16:05.480
the butcher's last kill,
was dumped.

16:05.565 --> 16:07.766
Heather's body is laid out
in the same way.

16:07.817 --> 16:10.268
Arms above her head,
demeaning straddle.

16:10.319 --> 16:11.920
Exactly the same
stab wounds.

16:11.988 --> 16:13.388
The wounds
are strategically placed

16:13.456 --> 16:14.939
so they miss
the major arteries

16:14.991 --> 16:16.425
but inflict maximum pain.

16:16.492 --> 16:18.276
These unsubs aren't just
trying to copy the butcher,

16:18.327 --> 16:20.278
they're trying to exactly
reenact his last kill.

16:20.329 --> 16:22.297
Copycats usually start
from the beginning.

16:22.381 --> 16:25.050
Why are they fixated
on the last crime?

16:25.117 --> 16:26.968
Something about this particular
case is significant to them?

16:27.053 --> 16:28.470
Morgan and Prentiss,
contact the parents.

16:28.554 --> 16:29.805
See if they got
a phone call.

16:29.889 --> 16:31.790
You should make
the notification first.

16:31.841 --> 16:35.644
We will. And we'll, uh,
bring the parents down to the station.

16:35.728 --> 16:39.147
We need to release
the profile.

16:39.232 --> 16:41.299
Hotch.

16:41.350 --> 16:43.985
The butcher is somehow
involved in this.

16:44.070 --> 16:45.637
The nuances
are just too similar.

16:45.688 --> 16:47.639
The park, the hand position,
the body.

16:47.690 --> 16:49.324
I think we should wait
on the profile.

16:49.408 --> 16:51.142
But there are aspects
of the butcher's signature

16:51.194 --> 16:52.644
that are not present
here, Dave.

16:52.695 --> 16:55.247
And there are things that this unsub is doing
the butcher never did.

16:55.314 --> 16:57.582
You profiled him as a narcissist
who worked alone.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.167
He would never
partner up.

16:59.252 --> 17:02.921
I just have a gut feeling
that it's him.

17:02.988 --> 17:05.589
Do you want to hold back
the profile based on a feeling?

17:13.382 --> 17:15.099
These unsubs,
or unknown subjects,

17:15.166 --> 17:16.601
are considerably organized.

17:16.669 --> 17:18.936
They most likely have some sort of
secondary location

17:19.003 --> 17:21.106
they use to torture
the victims.

17:21.173 --> 17:24.108
Their skill level is evidenced
by the high-risk public nature

17:24.175 --> 17:25.609
of their abductions.

17:25.678 --> 17:27.612
Prentiss: They're able to
lure their intended victims

17:27.680 --> 17:31.032
with some kind of a ruse. They then
blitz them with overwhelming force...

17:31.117 --> 17:35.203
Susan: Mom, daddy...
He wants me to say I enjoyed it, but I didn't.

17:35.288 --> 17:36.788
Unsub: Yes, she did.
She's dead.

17:36.856 --> 17:40.191
I'm in trouble.
I'm in so much trouble.

17:40.243 --> 17:42.494
I know you taught me
to never be afraid,

17:42.545 --> 17:44.296
but I am so afraid.

17:44.363 --> 17:48.133
Agent Rossi, has the butcher
come out of hiding?

17:48.200 --> 17:51.219
We think that this is
the work of two of his fans

17:51.304 --> 17:54.506
and that they're
going to strike again.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.402
You're in a good mood.

18:07.486 --> 18:10.238
Wednesday was always
a good day for me.

18:10.323 --> 18:12.073
Yesterday was Tuesday.

18:18.164 --> 18:20.365
She was good.

18:20.416 --> 18:22.233
She responded right.

18:22.285 --> 18:23.919
I upped the volts
on the charger.

18:24.003 --> 18:25.420
I think that helped.

18:25.504 --> 18:27.088
The call went better, too.

18:27.173 --> 18:30.125
You got her to say
exactly what I needed.

18:31.243 --> 18:33.461
You've never been
so helpful.

18:35.848 --> 18:37.265
That's not true.

18:37.350 --> 18:40.685
Name one time you helped me
without being told.

18:40.753 --> 18:43.271
When I was 10.

18:43.356 --> 18:44.773
Oh, please.

18:44.857 --> 18:47.859
No, I--I helped with the woman
in the hallway.

18:47.927 --> 18:49.277
There was never a woman
in the hallway.

18:49.362 --> 18:50.278
Yes, there was.

18:50.363 --> 18:53.031
She was running and...

19:07.463 --> 19:10.465
I got her for you.

19:10.549 --> 19:12.751
You remember that?
I helped out.

19:12.802 --> 19:16.688
Well, how are you
gonna help me today?

19:19.725 --> 19:21.259
Uh...

19:21.310 --> 19:23.962
The pharmacy girl
gets off at 2:00,

19:24.013 --> 19:26.431
the nurse's shift
ends at 3:00,

19:26.482 --> 19:30.402
and the teacher gets out
of school at 3:30.

19:31.520 --> 19:33.939
What about that girl
outside the other day?

19:35.825 --> 19:38.760
Anna, our neighbor?

19:38.828 --> 19:40.779
She's too close.

19:42.999 --> 19:44.749
Where's her picture?

19:45.835 --> 19:46.952
We never took one.

19:47.036 --> 19:50.689
No, come on,
choose one of these girls.

19:50.756 --> 19:52.757
They'll all be good.

20:11.176 --> 20:13.144
Dave.

20:13.195 --> 20:15.780
I know you're not convinced
about the profile.

20:15.848 --> 20:18.016
The butcher
is a part of this.

20:18.067 --> 20:20.518
Bundy stopped using
his broken arm ruse.

20:20.569 --> 20:23.021
Dahmer didn't eat
all of his victims.

20:23.072 --> 20:25.523
Sometimes the psychopathology
changes for these guys.

20:25.591 --> 20:28.043
I know. I still think
it's a copycat.

20:28.127 --> 20:29.544
I'm not so sure.

20:29.628 --> 20:30.829
Then if you feel
this strongly,

20:30.880 --> 20:33.498
you should continue to explore
the butcher as a suspect,

20:33.549 --> 20:36.334
and the rest of the team
will investigate the possibility

20:36.402 --> 20:38.553
of the relationship
between the two copycats.

20:38.637 --> 20:40.705
Thanks.

20:46.645 --> 20:48.513
The Yoshim dual knife
is the best on the market.

20:48.564 --> 20:51.316
Its serrated blade allows you
to cut through anything.

20:51.383 --> 20:54.069
And the handle
is dishwasher safe.

20:54.153 --> 20:56.237
If you buy one today,
you will also get

20:56.322 --> 20:57.722
our Yoshim two-pronged
carving fork...

20:57.773 --> 20:59.157
I love her hands.

20:59.224 --> 21:02.277
I'll be here next Friday,
so you can pick one up then, too.

21:02.361 --> 21:04.996
She's got pretty hands.

22:05.841 --> 22:08.393
[Tires screeching]

22:15.901 --> 22:17.468
This is what it is.

22:17.520 --> 22:19.070
A father-son partnership?

22:19.138 --> 22:20.972
Wait, an older Alpha
with a younger submissive?

22:21.023 --> 22:23.408
It's very rare for sexual sadism to be
an inherited trait.

22:23.475 --> 22:25.410
That's why we ruled it out.

22:25.477 --> 22:27.328
What if he created his partner
and groomed him?

22:27.413 --> 22:30.648
He would be in complete
control and have his trust.

22:30.699 --> 22:33.317
It would explain how
the butcher is able to abduct women.

22:33.369 --> 22:35.837
He's older, appears harmless,
but his son lies in wait.

22:35.921 --> 22:38.990
The butcher has a child.
I never profiled that.

22:39.041 --> 22:41.426
I just got a call
from Heather Langley's father.

22:41.494 --> 22:42.760
Turns out
he did get a message.

22:42.828 --> 22:44.162
He said he'd checked
his phone.

22:44.213 --> 22:45.964
No one thought to check
Mr. Langley's job.

22:46.015 --> 22:47.999
His secretary pulled the voicemail.
She can play it for us.

22:48.050 --> 22:49.017
Let's hear it.

22:49.101 --> 22:51.669
Go ahead, please.

22:51.720 --> 22:55.640
Mom, dad, this is Heather.

22:55.691 --> 22:57.542
When you get this message,

22:57.610 --> 22:59.477
I'll probably be dead.

22:59.545 --> 23:03.865
Tomorrow you're
going to find me,

23:03.949 --> 23:08.653
[crying] And when you do,
please know that I...

23:08.704 --> 23:10.288
I enjoyed it.

23:10.356 --> 23:12.857
Rossi: I enjoyed it.
That's his signature.

23:12.925 --> 23:15.460
It's him.

23:15.527 --> 23:18.963
Aah!
[electricity zapping]

23:20.966 --> 23:22.584
I'm not saying this.

23:22.668 --> 23:24.886
Say it.

23:24.970 --> 23:26.554
You gotta stick
to the script.

23:26.639 --> 23:27.555
I won't!

23:27.640 --> 23:28.556
She's ruining it!

23:28.641 --> 23:29.891
If you'd just
brought me Annie,

23:29.975 --> 23:30.975
none of this
would've happened.

23:31.043 --> 23:31.976
Dad, please.

23:32.044 --> 23:33.044
Please, my ass.

23:33.095 --> 23:34.429
You can't get anything right.

23:34.546 --> 23:36.147
You can't get the house right,
my food right,

23:36.215 --> 23:37.982
you can't get the kill right.

23:38.050 --> 23:40.401
I'll show you how to kill.
I'll show you how to kill!

23:42.238 --> 23:43.571
I'll show you how to kill.

23:43.656 --> 23:48.159
[Screaming]

23:54.011 --> 23:55.111
Agent Rossi,

23:55.178 --> 23:57.346
uh, I need to give
the press a statement.

23:57.381 --> 23:58.431
Not yet.

23:58.498 --> 23:59.765
Word's already
leaked out

23:59.850 --> 24:01.434
that this is the butcher
and his son.

24:01.518 --> 24:03.419
Well, fix your faucet
and tell your men to be quiet.

24:03.470 --> 24:06.772
Look, people are scared. This guy's
spent a decade terrorizing this area--

24:06.857 --> 24:09.392
you think I don't know that?

24:09.443 --> 24:11.777
We need to figure out
why he's back,

24:11.862 --> 24:13.446
like BTK
or the grim sleeper.

24:13.530 --> 24:15.147
Let's go over victimology
one more time.

24:15.232 --> 24:17.450
He kills blondes who
are living on their own.

24:17.534 --> 24:20.036
He takes them from public places
with some form of ruse.

24:20.103 --> 24:22.605
He's reenacting his last kill.
For what reason?

24:22.673 --> 24:24.606
Maybe there's something symbolic
about the last kill.

24:24.658 --> 24:25.958
Let's hear her call
again.

24:26.043 --> 24:27.860
Hey, guys, maybe we should
take a look at the victims

24:27.928 --> 24:29.261
that didn't call anybody.

24:29.329 --> 24:32.415
There were 13 recording
messages and 5 documented

24:32.466 --> 24:34.050
conversations
with loved ones.

24:34.117 --> 24:35.584
So what?

24:35.635 --> 24:37.636
So there were 20 kills.
Two victims didn't call anyone.

24:37.721 --> 24:40.723
I just assumed those victims
couldn't reach anyone.

24:40.790 --> 24:42.641
Let's pull the files of the victims that
didn't leave a message.

24:42.726 --> 24:44.560
Reid might be onto something.

24:44.627 --> 24:47.146
[TV playing]

24:47.230 --> 24:48.848
[Noises outside]

25:00.527 --> 25:02.228
What are you doing?

25:02.295 --> 25:04.413
What's it look like?

25:04.481 --> 25:05.398
I'm hungry.

25:05.465 --> 25:07.583
And my stories
aren't on.

25:07.650 --> 25:09.285
10 minutes and I'll be in.

25:09.336 --> 25:11.653
I want to go hunt.

25:11.705 --> 25:14.924
No, dad.
We're not hunting today.

25:14.991 --> 25:16.158
Why not?

25:17.344 --> 25:18.511
We need to lay low.

25:18.595 --> 25:20.662
I mean, there's cops
all over the neighborhood.

25:20.714 --> 25:22.848
We'll start up again
next week, ok?

25:22.933 --> 25:24.166
I don't want to wait.

25:24.217 --> 25:26.519
It's been 3 damn weeks
since we've been hunting.

25:27.521 --> 25:29.772
Dad, we hunted yesterday.

25:29.839 --> 25:32.191
No, we didn't.

25:32.275 --> 25:33.476
Yeah, we did.

25:33.527 --> 25:35.061
Look in there.

25:38.982 --> 25:41.367
I didn't do that.

25:41.451 --> 25:42.651
Yeah, you did.

25:42.702 --> 25:44.353
No, I didn't.

25:44.404 --> 25:45.988
You've been hunting
without me.

25:46.056 --> 25:48.240
Why would I hunt
without you?

25:52.746 --> 25:54.130
What's her name?

25:54.197 --> 25:56.031
Shelly something.

25:56.083 --> 25:58.084
We got her
at the pharmacy.

25:58.168 --> 25:59.251
I didn't do that.

25:59.336 --> 26:00.586
She was selling knives.

26:00.670 --> 26:02.388
Why would I do that?
I got knives.

26:02.472 --> 26:04.473
She wouldn't
say the words.

26:07.094 --> 26:08.427
That's not my work.

26:08.512 --> 26:10.212
I don't do work like that.

26:10.263 --> 26:13.065
Dad, it's ok
if you don't remember.

26:13.150 --> 26:14.934
Aah! [grunts]

26:15.018 --> 26:17.386
Dad, this is normal.

26:17.437 --> 26:18.904
This ain't normal.

26:18.989 --> 26:21.723
If I'm doing work like that,

26:21.775 --> 26:23.609
then you need to kill me.

26:23.693 --> 26:26.278
Just kill me!

26:27.948 --> 26:30.449
So Sylvia marks was
the butcher's first kill.

26:30.517 --> 26:32.585
Karen Bachner
was his eighth.

26:32.669 --> 26:34.320
So why weren't they forced
to make phone calls?

26:34.387 --> 26:36.572
Sylvia
was his first kill.

26:36.623 --> 26:38.424
He was building up
his confidence.

26:38.508 --> 26:40.793
Then he thinks to himself,
how can I hurt the most people?

26:40.877 --> 26:42.261
I'll have them make calls.

26:42.345 --> 26:43.963
And then 6 women after that
made phone calls.

26:44.047 --> 26:45.414
Why did he stop at Karen?

26:45.465 --> 26:49.852
Garcia, what are Karen Bachner's
parents' names?

26:49.919 --> 26:54.089
George and Claire Bachner
died in a car accident when Karen was 19.

26:54.141 --> 26:57.143
But my notes say Karen had a husband
named Lee Mullens.

26:57.227 --> 26:58.594
But he didn't receive a call.

26:58.645 --> 26:59.862
When I interviewed him
at the station,

26:59.929 --> 27:01.697
he said he didn't have
an answering machine.

27:01.764 --> 27:02.931
Do they have a child?

27:02.983 --> 27:04.099
Uh, negative.

27:04.151 --> 27:05.451
Wait a minute.

27:05.535 --> 27:07.936
They had a son. I wrote it down.
Colby.

27:07.988 --> 27:09.705
Garcia, run Karen's
maiden name.

27:09.772 --> 27:10.939
Bachner.

27:10.991 --> 27:13.075
Oh--there it is, sir.
You are totally right.

27:13.126 --> 27:14.610
Karen had a son,
Colby Bachner,

27:14.661 --> 27:16.946
born at Johnson Memorial
in Bristol, Virginia.

27:17.013 --> 27:19.048
Was the father there to sign
the birth certificate?

27:19.115 --> 27:20.966
Yes. His name was...

27:21.051 --> 27:22.284
Lee Mullens.

27:22.335 --> 27:24.470
Oh. Karen had Colby

27:24.538 --> 27:26.955
2 years before her and Lee
were married.

27:27.007 --> 27:28.841
Are the father or son
still in the area?

27:30.427 --> 27:32.294
Yeah. Lee Mullens
and Colby Bachner

27:32.345 --> 27:35.297
live at 1844 Shadow Wood lane,

27:35.348 --> 27:38.467
which is 6 miles from
where the victims were dumped.

27:38.518 --> 27:40.319
Reid: So maybe Karen Bachner
never made a call

27:40.403 --> 27:41.820
because the most important
person in her life

27:41.905 --> 27:44.306
was already in the room
with her--her son.

27:44.357 --> 27:45.774
Oh, hells, no.

27:45.825 --> 27:47.626
They're licensed electricians.

27:47.694 --> 27:48.744
Let's go.

27:49.812 --> 27:52.998
[TV playing in other room]

28:14.037 --> 28:15.938
Dad?

28:16.006 --> 28:18.140
We should talk.

28:22.011 --> 28:25.013
Fine. We can
go hunt today.

28:25.065 --> 28:26.848
I'll go
pick someone up

28:26.900 --> 28:29.184
and then I'll
come and get you.

28:31.021 --> 28:34.957
I'm gonna get you someone
that'll make you really happy.

28:39.296 --> 28:42.298
I'll come by and pick you up
when I got her.

28:42.365 --> 28:44.583
Ok?

28:44.668 --> 28:47.236
I wrote down where I'm going.

28:51.308 --> 28:52.558
And you're all set.

28:52.642 --> 28:55.411
Thank you so much.
Have a good day.

28:55.478 --> 28:56.595
Hey.

28:56.663 --> 28:58.230
Ready for that coffee?

28:58.315 --> 28:59.598
Yeah.

29:59.326 --> 30:00.709
FBI. Don't move.

30:00.777 --> 30:03.379
Put your hands in the air.

30:03.446 --> 30:04.997
What are you doing here?

30:05.081 --> 30:06.632
Sir, move slowly
down the stairs.

30:06.716 --> 30:08.634
Why are you here?

30:08.718 --> 30:09.802
My son isn't here.

30:09.886 --> 30:11.637
You're under arrest
for the murders

30:11.721 --> 30:15.007
of Chloe Moore, Reilly Gold,
and Sylvia Marks.

30:15.091 --> 30:17.676
I don't know them.

30:17.761 --> 30:21.680
Please,
I need to call someone.

30:21.765 --> 30:23.649
You can call
from the station.

30:23.733 --> 30:24.850
Rossi, wait.

30:24.934 --> 30:26.352
Hotch: Dave--
I'm done waiting.

30:40.688 --> 30:43.573
We checked the house.
There's no torture chamber, no son.

30:43.640 --> 30:45.408
There's a fresh grave
in the backyard,

30:45.475 --> 30:46.943
and the son Colby
left a note saying

30:46.994 --> 30:49.145
he was going
to find a prize.

30:49.196 --> 30:52.148
Garcia, check Mullens' records and
see if he owns any other property.

30:52.199 --> 30:54.284
Check under the son's name,
employment records, anything you can find.

30:54.335 --> 30:55.418
Got it.

30:56.420 --> 30:57.820
Hey, guys.

30:57.872 --> 30:58.922
I think I found something.

30:58.989 --> 31:01.758
Morgan, let's get
all the police cars

31:01.825 --> 31:04.177
out of the neighborhood
in case the son comes back.

31:24.365 --> 31:26.182
Everything in the house
is labeled--

31:26.233 --> 31:28.451
drawers, the refrigerator.
I found donepezil and flashcards

31:28.518 --> 31:29.819
in the medicine cabinet.

31:29.870 --> 31:32.655
Donepezil?
Alzheimer's?

31:32.706 --> 31:34.490
It's a cholinesterase inhibitor.
It improves acetylcholine,

31:34.541 --> 31:38.211
either by increasing levels in the brain or
enhancing nerve cells' response to it.

31:38.295 --> 31:41.381
So this guy gets to forgot while the family
has to live with this forever.

31:41.465 --> 31:44.217
Alzheimer's affects short-term memory
before it affects long-term.

31:44.301 --> 31:47.036
That it explains the scripted
phone calls and the dump sites.

31:47.087 --> 31:48.721
It also explains
why he started up again.

31:48.806 --> 31:50.390
He's repeating his last kill
because he can't remember it.

31:50.474 --> 31:52.475
He killed over
a 10-year period.

31:52.542 --> 31:54.260
He probably remembers
the earliest victims.

31:54.345 --> 31:55.762
Rossi: What did you find?

31:55.846 --> 31:58.714
He's got slides of all
the prior abduction sites.

31:58.766 --> 32:00.016
You want me
to go in with you?

32:00.067 --> 32:02.218
I've got this.

32:16.867 --> 32:19.502
We met 20 years ago.

32:19.569 --> 32:21.537
Do you remember that,
Mullens?

32:21.588 --> 32:25.208
I'd like a soda
with lemon, thank you.

32:25.259 --> 32:26.960
You played
the grieving husband.

32:27.044 --> 32:30.129
I was a young FBI Agent.

32:30.214 --> 32:33.967
Do you remember these women?

32:35.585 --> 32:36.953
I don't know them.

32:37.021 --> 32:40.273
Of course you do.
You wouldn't have forgotten them yet.

32:40.341 --> 32:41.975
So tell me,

32:42.059 --> 32:44.827
where is your son, Mullens?

32:44.895 --> 32:46.946
Where is he taking
your next victim?

32:47.031 --> 32:50.450
To a friend's place?
To an abandoned house?

32:50.534 --> 32:51.784
I rewired this house.

32:51.869 --> 32:53.236
Did he help you with that?

32:53.287 --> 32:55.938
Or did you do that
on your own?

32:55.990 --> 32:57.273
Like you did...

32:57.324 --> 32:59.742
All of these.

32:59.793 --> 33:01.444
Those your trophies?

33:01.512 --> 33:03.246
What do you know
about trophies?

33:03.313 --> 33:06.165
I like trophies.

33:06.233 --> 33:08.634
It proves
you won something.

33:09.837 --> 33:12.005
Well, you're not
gonna win today.

33:14.958 --> 33:17.010
I'm scared.

33:19.480 --> 33:22.131
You don't have a right
to be scared.

33:22.199 --> 33:23.816
Those women were scared.

33:23.901 --> 33:27.403
Now, where's your son?

33:32.359 --> 33:33.809
Please, Colby, stop.

33:33.861 --> 33:35.244
Stop talking.

33:35.312 --> 33:37.830
Why are you doing this to me?

33:37.915 --> 33:39.982
Please, why are you
doing this to me?

33:40.034 --> 33:41.617
Please stop talking!

33:41.668 --> 33:43.619
[Grunts]

33:45.039 --> 33:47.990
Please, just let me go.
I won't tell them.

33:48.042 --> 33:49.592
Shut up. Shut up.

33:50.827 --> 33:51.961
Shut up!

33:52.012 --> 33:55.498
It must be hard
to lose your mind.

33:56.934 --> 33:58.267
I wouldn't know.

33:58.335 --> 34:00.503
You start forgetting
how to feed yourself.

34:00.554 --> 34:03.773
Soon you're stinking up
your pants,

34:03.840 --> 34:05.174
wearing diapers.

34:05.225 --> 34:06.776
I ain't wearing no diaper.

34:06.843 --> 34:09.612
You peed into your boxers
2 minutes ago.

34:09.679 --> 34:11.179
You need them now.

34:13.683 --> 34:14.784
So...

34:16.853 --> 34:18.938
How did you get your son

34:19.005 --> 34:21.456
to do all this?

34:21.525 --> 34:24.494
Did you get him to help you
to kill your wife?

34:24.561 --> 34:25.495
Karen left us.

34:25.562 --> 34:26.496
No, no, no, no.

34:26.563 --> 34:28.748
That's what you convinced him.

34:28.831 --> 34:32.635
But you killed her
when she figured you out.

34:32.702 --> 34:35.638
You took her to a chamber,

34:35.705 --> 34:38.775
the same place you took
Heather Langley,

34:38.842 --> 34:40.927
Kara Kirkland,

34:41.011 --> 34:42.728
Sylvia Marks.

34:42.813 --> 34:44.597
Sylvia's a pretty name.

34:45.882 --> 34:48.650
She graduated from Georgetown.

34:48.717 --> 34:51.404
She wanted to be a chemist.

34:51.487 --> 34:53.422
But you burned her so bad,

34:53.489 --> 34:56.125
her family couldn't
recognize her.

34:56.193 --> 34:58.227
How did you do that?

34:58.278 --> 35:01.280
Did you use a fire poker
or a curling iron?

35:01.365 --> 35:05.768
Something you made?
Something you bought?

35:05.836 --> 35:09.088
When she saw the Lexwell,
her eyes went so wide,

35:09.173 --> 35:11.958
she scared me half to death.

35:13.760 --> 35:16.245
Find out what that is.

35:17.914 --> 35:19.599
Lexwell is a camera
manufacturer

35:19.683 --> 35:22.585
based out of New York.
They've been around since the forties.

35:22.653 --> 35:24.770
Have they always produced
photography equipment?

35:24.855 --> 35:26.422
Uh, back in the day,

35:26.473 --> 35:28.274
they made electroshock
therapy equipment.

35:28.358 --> 35:30.359
Unknown object
penetrating our victims.

35:30.427 --> 35:33.029
Garcia, what mental hospitals
in Virginia use ECT machines?

35:33.096 --> 35:35.364
5 hospitals
use Lexwell equipment.

35:35.432 --> 35:37.283
Of those 5,
3 have been torn down,

35:37.367 --> 35:38.434
2 are still in operation.

35:38.485 --> 35:41.037
Ok, cross-check
that list of hospitals

35:41.104 --> 35:43.105
against Mullens'
electrical business client list.

35:43.157 --> 35:44.824
Yeah, I'm already doing that.

35:44.908 --> 35:47.793
Mullens wired some buildings
at the Oakton Center back in the eighties.

35:47.878 --> 35:50.046
It's a former mental institution.
You know that place?

35:50.113 --> 35:53.082
Yeah, on 86 acres.
Two of the buildings are still in operation.

35:53.133 --> 35:55.001
The rest of the place
is abandoned.

35:55.085 --> 35:57.053
Thanks, baby girl.

35:58.055 --> 36:00.122
Hotch, we know
where the kid is.

36:04.361 --> 36:06.562
Where are you going?

36:43.850 --> 36:45.885
[Muffled cry]

36:49.172 --> 36:50.506
Colby.

36:54.177 --> 36:55.278
Put down the knife.

36:55.345 --> 36:56.562
I'll kill her.

36:56.647 --> 36:58.948
The killing is done.

36:59.015 --> 37:00.366
Please help me.

37:04.571 --> 37:07.873
This is not your fault, Colby.

37:07.958 --> 37:10.025
Your father got you into this.

37:10.077 --> 37:13.012
No, no.
You don't know my dad.

37:13.080 --> 37:14.580
We know you're
losing him, Colby.

37:14.665 --> 37:16.165
This isn't gonna help.

37:16.233 --> 37:18.467
He's getting better.

37:18.535 --> 37:20.253
No. He isn't.

37:20.337 --> 37:21.754
And I know
that scares you

37:21.838 --> 37:23.472
because you already
lost your mother.

37:23.540 --> 37:24.873
She left us!

37:24.925 --> 37:26.092
Your father killed her.

37:26.176 --> 37:27.927
No.

37:28.011 --> 37:31.264
No, no.
No, you're wrong.

37:31.348 --> 37:33.149
You were 10.

37:35.686 --> 37:38.220
He strapped her
to this table.

37:38.272 --> 37:42.024
My mom went to Boston
to live with her sister.

37:42.075 --> 37:44.059
Your father
brought her here.

37:44.111 --> 37:45.995
You were probably
in the car.

37:49.833 --> 37:51.083
You blocked it out.

37:51.168 --> 37:52.168
Think back.

37:52.235 --> 37:55.421
He most likely
knocked her out at home

37:55.505 --> 37:56.872
and brought her here.

37:56.923 --> 38:01.427
The--the only woman
we brought here from the house,

38:01.511 --> 38:03.346
I helped him with.

38:11.521 --> 38:14.507
And that was
your mother, Colby.

38:24.868 --> 38:26.602
No...

38:26.670 --> 38:28.571
She--she left us.

38:29.573 --> 38:32.775
Every one
of your father's victims

38:32.826 --> 38:35.444
made a call,

38:35.495 --> 38:38.080
except for your mother.

38:38.131 --> 38:40.282
Because she laid
on this table

38:40.334 --> 38:43.886
and said goodbye to you
right here.

38:52.128 --> 38:56.098
This wasn't your fault,
Colby.

38:56.149 --> 38:58.651
Mommy loves you.

38:58.735 --> 39:01.637
[Crying]

39:02.639 --> 39:04.990
She--she...

39:05.075 --> 39:07.443
She's not dead.

39:07.494 --> 39:11.614
She...She left us.

39:11.665 --> 39:14.583
She--she...

39:14.651 --> 39:17.136
She left us!

39:17.204 --> 39:19.538
You don't want
to hurt her, son.

39:27.631 --> 39:30.933
[Colby crying]

39:44.114 --> 39:46.365
[Sobbing]

39:53.189 --> 39:55.741
You know, parents are supposed to protect
their children.

39:55.826 --> 39:57.693
Well, sometimes
they don't get the memo.

39:57.744 --> 40:00.362
[Cell phone beeps]

40:01.798 --> 40:03.966
Oh, please don't tell me
that's Ellie again.

40:04.033 --> 40:05.918
She just wants me
to say good night.

40:07.871 --> 40:10.473
Trust me, Prentiss,
I get it.

40:10.540 --> 40:12.641
But I'm the first person she wants
to speak to in the morning.

40:12.709 --> 40:15.144
She won't go to bed unless she talks
to me at night.

40:15.211 --> 40:17.997
The girl's got PTSD.
She's gotta vent to someone.

40:18.064 --> 40:20.850
A professional.

40:20.901 --> 40:23.552
Or someone who's been there.

40:30.393 --> 40:32.244
Hey, uh...

40:32.329 --> 40:35.581
None of us here ever
thought we'd get the butcher.

40:35.665 --> 40:37.166
Nice work.

40:37.233 --> 40:39.618
You, too.

40:42.739 --> 40:44.924
Hey, Rossi.

40:45.008 --> 40:48.210
I do remember you.

40:48.261 --> 40:51.514
In the end,
you're the reason I stopped.

41:03.059 --> 41:04.610
Rossi: Mark Twain wrote,

41:04.694 --> 41:08.030
"when I was younger,
I could remember anything,

41:08.097 --> 41:10.499
"whether it had
happened or not.

41:10.567 --> 41:15.120
"But my faculties
are decaying now...

41:15.205 --> 41:19.291
"And soon I shall be
so I cannot remember anything

41:19.376 --> 41:22.328
but the things
that never happened."

41:22.412 --> 41:25.798
Guard: I need a gurney.
Prisoner down.

41:30.720 --> 41:33.973
Rossi: "It is sad
to go to pieces like this,

41:34.057 --> 41:36.759
but we all have to do it."
