01:52.685 --> 01:55.485
-It's a beautiful day, isn't it?
-I'm sure. Give me a minute.

01:59.565 --> 02:02.925
No, no, no! It can't be!
It can't be! Agh!

02:03.645 --> 02:06.405
-Woo-hoo!
-What's going on?

02:06.485 --> 02:09.205
It's me! I've been nominated

02:33.565 --> 02:35.325
Ooh, you little beauty!

02:35.405 --> 02:38.725
Just imagine -
Chief Ken, best lawyer in the country.

02:38.805 --> 02:42.045
Well, it's Lichfield.
Lichfield Lawyer Of The Year.

02:42.125 --> 02:44.485
Got it. So it's not half as big
of a deal as I thought.

02:44.565 --> 02:45.965
-Well...
-Still, Chief Ken.

02:46.045 --> 02:48.765
I'm excited for you to collect
your prize - meagre though it may be.

02:49.685 --> 02:53.205
Every year, we just get drunk
and bored at that fancy black tie do.

02:53.285 --> 02:55.125
-This will give it all meaning.
-Right.

02:55.205 --> 02:57.565
Oi! It's our charity
that runs that ceremony.

02:57.645 --> 03:00.765
Me and Nina work very hard
to get you drunk, Mum.

03:00.845 --> 03:02.085
Or at least I do.

03:02.165 --> 03:03.365
Nina networks.

03:03.445 --> 03:04.805
Network Nina!

03:04.885 --> 03:06.565
OK, Mum. Move your arse!

03:06.645 --> 03:10.365
Dylan, your father has been
nominated for an award!

03:10.445 --> 03:13.845
Oh! Congratulations!
Loser Of The Year?

03:13.925 --> 03:15.885
It's great you're finally
getting recognised.

03:15.965 --> 03:19.365
You work in phone sales.
Your monthly wage couldn't buy a Mars Bar,

03:19.445 --> 03:21.485
and you're getting a lift to work
with your mother.

03:21.565 --> 03:24.085
Money's tight, but he's not
scrimping on hair gel, is he?

03:24.165 --> 03:25.725
Well, I can't help being a baller, Rach.

03:25.805 --> 03:27.205
God gave me balls,

03:27.285 --> 03:28.445
and I ball with them.

03:28.525 --> 03:31.285
Do you think your balls might
give me some rent some time?

03:31.365 --> 03:33.845
-Do you think you might suck my balls?
-Dylan!

03:34.525 --> 03:36.965
You should have let me hit him
when he was smaller.

03:37.045 --> 03:39.285
I bloody should have done! Bye, love.

03:41.565 --> 03:45.125
Chief Ken, could I accompany you to work?
Just I have a small matter to discuss.

03:45.205 --> 03:47.605
All right, OK, hop to it, then.
You can take that.

03:47.685 --> 03:48.925
OK.

03:56.245 --> 03:58.445
This award should really change things.

03:58.525 --> 04:02.045
Jane has been totally undermining me
since I got back from paternity leave.

04:02.125 --> 04:04.525
It'll be nice to remind people

04:04.605 --> 04:07.885
about who is senior partner
and who is <i>not</i> senior partner!

04:07.965 --> 04:10.765
-You are senior partner, Chief Ken.
-You know I am, right?

04:13.925 --> 04:17.885
Dale, are you all right? You don't seem to
be your usual sickeningly cheerful self.

04:18.325 --> 04:21.325
Me? Yeah, everything's fine.

04:21.404 --> 04:23.404
I'm absolutely doodle dandy!

04:23.485 --> 04:24.844
-Right.
-OK.

04:28.845 --> 04:31.325
Wait, Dale! Dale!

04:38.605 --> 04:40.325
What the hell is going on?

04:40.405 --> 04:42.125
-[romantic melody]
-And who's he?

04:42.205 --> 04:45.885
Sorry, Chief Ken, I have so many tummy
butterflies, the words aren't coming out.

04:45.965 --> 04:49.005
Right, well, get on with it.
This is my workplace!

04:49.085 --> 04:49.965
OK.

04:50.045 --> 04:53.205
Chief Ken, I have inhabited your home
for several years now,

04:53.285 --> 04:55.845
and I've recently been joined in
romantic union with your daughter.

04:55.925 --> 04:59.005
-As my father was before me.
-Probably best to keep schtum about that.

04:59.085 --> 05:00.725
So...

05:01.285 --> 05:05.165
I was wondering, Chief Ken Thompson,
would you do me the honour

05:05.245 --> 05:09.165
of permitting me, Dale Ashbrick,
to propose to your daughter?

05:09.245 --> 05:12.085
-Is this why you're kneeling?
-I wanted to do it the traditional way.

05:12.165 --> 05:16.645
Mate, you and Rachel are great together!

05:16.725 --> 05:19.445
It's just, should your focus
be wedding rings

05:19.525 --> 05:22.245
when you haven't got a job
and you're sharing my bathroom?

05:22.325 --> 05:24.445
[melancholic melody]

05:24.525 --> 05:25.645
Wow!

05:25.725 --> 05:27.965
Tough truths, Chief Ken.

05:28.525 --> 05:32.285
I clearly did not think this one through.
That is super unlike me.

05:33.125 --> 05:34.685
There's plenty of time to get married.

05:35.685 --> 05:36.645
All right?

05:40.685 --> 05:43.245
-You are so right, Chief Ken.
-[optimistic melody]

05:43.325 --> 05:46.485
I'm going to get the best job
that has ever existed, bar none.

05:46.565 --> 05:49.805
Then propose to your daughter and live
happily ever after in Lichfield, England.

05:52.845 --> 05:55.845
OK. I paid for the whole day.
Follow me.

05:56.845 --> 05:58.565
[jaunty melody]

06:13.085 --> 06:14.845
"On the..." what?

06:17.925 --> 06:19.645
[conversation, laughter]

06:20.605 --> 06:23.165
-Oh, Ken, there you are!
-Hi, guys.

06:23.245 --> 06:25.885
I've just seen the new
"Meet the Team" board out in the lobby.

06:25.965 --> 06:29.725
Two things. One, why does my photo
look like I'm drunk?

06:29.805 --> 06:33.205
And two, my motto makes zero sense.

06:33.285 --> 06:35.165
It's the motto you wanted.

06:35.245 --> 06:36.805
It says, "On the Whole!"

06:36.885 --> 06:38.885
-Why would I want that as my motto?
-Let's see.

06:38.965 --> 06:42.885
I asked for three words
that sum up your approach.

06:43.445 --> 06:45.925
Yes, your e-mail read,
"On the whole,

06:46.005 --> 06:49.445
I'd say the most important part
of the job, yadda yadda."

06:49.525 --> 06:52.645
-Obviously, I had to do an edit.
-Oh, obviously!

06:52.725 --> 06:54.725
Also, you sent your photo
in the wrong format,

06:54.805 --> 06:56.925
but Noel had a snap
from the Christmas party.

06:57.005 --> 06:58.925
-Got your back, bro!
-Aw!

06:59.005 --> 07:00.325
Well, that is a shame

07:00.405 --> 07:02.565
because all of that's going
to have to come down.

07:02.645 --> 07:05.685
-Is this some ego thing?
-No.

07:05.765 --> 07:09.045
It's about putting our shiniest product
in the shop window.

07:09.125 --> 07:09.965
And that is me.

07:10.045 --> 07:13.205
Because, well...

07:14.765 --> 07:19.445
I have been nominated
for Lawyer Of The Year.

07:19.525 --> 07:20.885
Boo-ya!

07:21.645 --> 07:23.885
Wow, Ken! That's actually impressive.

07:23.965 --> 07:25.485
Yes, it is, isn't it?

07:25.565 --> 07:28.485
Looks like old Ken
is still quite the asset.

07:28.565 --> 07:31.725
Oh, Ken, you know how valued you are.

07:31.805 --> 07:35.085
Oh, look, snap!
I've been nominated, too.

07:36.285 --> 07:38.845
-What?
-Lawyer Of The Year.

07:38.925 --> 07:42.445
-We're both up for it.
-That <i>is</i> great news!

07:42.525 --> 07:44.485
I love that news!

07:44.565 --> 07:48.445
All other news should be cancelled
because that is... that's the best news.

07:48.525 --> 07:50.285
Oh!

07:50.365 --> 07:52.565
Three cheers for us. Hip hip!

07:55.165 --> 07:57.605
-Hip hip!
-[all] Hooray!

08:00.885 --> 08:03.725
-So, your first job was as a cult member.
-Mm-hm.

08:03.805 --> 08:07.325
-Then you spent six months working for...
-The Triads, right.

08:07.405 --> 08:10.125
[chuckles] They're an international
criminal organisation

08:10.205 --> 08:12.405
specialising in drug smuggling
and extortion.

08:12.965 --> 08:14.205
These days, I'm a child minder.

08:16.085 --> 08:19.725
Skills, "Black belt kung fu,
torture technique,

08:19.805 --> 08:22.365
large repertoire of nursery rhymes."

08:22.445 --> 08:26.565
-It also says here, "unspecified skill".
-Oh, yeah. Right. It's this.

08:32.565 --> 08:33.485
Ugh!

08:33.565 --> 08:36.565
I mean, do you know what that's called?
Maybe just put "shoe whirly thing".

08:37.205 --> 08:39.085
So, er, what do you reckon?

08:39.164 --> 08:42.605
I was thinking maybe a train driver
or something in high finance.

08:42.684 --> 08:44.445
I can put you in the system.

08:44.525 --> 08:47.924
But my advice would be go away
and work on yourself.

08:49.205 --> 08:50.645
Really, quite a lot.

08:54.525 --> 08:58.245
"...behaviour as to avoid followership,
this occurs when firms develop..."

08:58.325 --> 09:01.805
"...All about establishing the fact
of disciplines and processes..."

09:01.885 --> 09:04.845
"If a business already has a genuinely
differentiated offering,

09:04.925 --> 09:07.005
it is wise to follow..."

09:07.085 --> 09:10.325
"The herd instinct is clear in nature
and just as clear in business. Most--"

09:13.045 --> 09:15.885
-What's all this?
-Oh! Such a good day!

09:15.965 --> 09:17.925
-I started looking for a new job.
-Oh!

09:18.005 --> 09:19.885
Unfortunately, I'm not maximalised
for the job market

09:19.965 --> 09:21.685
due to the fact I possess zero education.

09:21.765 --> 09:24.085
-Huh. Problem there.
-No problem there, though.

09:24.165 --> 09:27.285
Because today, I found out
there are people who are wildly successful

09:27.365 --> 09:30.965
with no training or meaningful education.
They call themselves Americans.

09:31.045 --> 09:33.925
-Today, I read all their books.
-All of these?

09:34.005 --> 09:35.685
-Yeah.
-Dale, that's amazing!

09:35.765 --> 09:37.525
Yeah, I only managed two this morning,

09:37.605 --> 09:40.405
but then I read one on speed-reading,
and then things really took off.

09:40.485 --> 09:44.605
Rachel, I have learnt the secrets
of business. I learnt the rules of power.

09:44.685 --> 09:47.485
I learnt the power of Yes,
and the rules of the power of Yes.

09:47.565 --> 09:50.965
And the most important thing I learnt...

09:51.045 --> 09:52.645
is I can do this!

09:52.725 --> 09:55.365
-You can do what?
-This! Right here!

09:55.445 --> 09:57.645
Maybe I'm already doing it! I don't know!

09:57.725 --> 10:01.245
Dale!
You don't need to rush into anything.

10:01.325 --> 10:04.205
I'm working. We've got all that nannying
money saved up.

10:04.285 --> 10:05.285
Yeah.

10:05.365 --> 10:07.045
-[Lorna] Mum's home!
-[knock on door]

10:07.125 --> 10:09.565
I picked up some champers,
so we can celebrate your dad's award.

10:09.645 --> 10:11.725
-Ooh.
-All right, Dale? Good day?

10:12.605 --> 10:15.205
My day was wonderful, Lorna.
Thank you for asking.

10:15.285 --> 10:17.445
Right. There's something
a bit different about you.

10:17.525 --> 10:21.445
[chuckles] No magic to it, Lorn! Just eye
contact and meticulously brushed teeth.

10:22.245 --> 10:25.725
Rachel, that awards ceremony?
You <i>have</i> to get me into it.

10:25.805 --> 10:28.645
-It's invite-only. Why do you want to go?
-Are you kidding me?

10:28.725 --> 10:30.885
The top business minds
in all Lichfield will be there!

10:30.965 --> 10:33.245
It's the ideal spot
for me to sell my skills.

10:33.805 --> 10:35.405
Hiya, Ken!

10:35.485 --> 10:38.845
Chief Ken! I've self-actualised
as a winner and business visionary!

10:42.325 --> 10:43.685
[door slams]

10:47.365 --> 10:48.325
Ken?

10:49.605 --> 10:51.885
-Jane's been nominated for the award, too.
-Oh.

10:51.965 --> 10:55.645
Yeah. Once again, the universe takes
a big shit on my face.

10:56.485 --> 11:00.685
So what?
And who says you won't still win?

11:00.765 --> 11:02.205
As if!

11:02.285 --> 11:05.325
Jane's a shoo-in. She brings
all the big business to the firm.

11:05.405 --> 11:06.645
If I hadn't taken paternity leave,

11:06.725 --> 11:08.965
she wouldn't have been nominated,
mark my words.

11:09.045 --> 11:11.685
Ken, you're a hero to me
and to women everywhere.

11:11.765 --> 11:14.005
Oh, yeah, they don't stop cheering!

11:14.085 --> 11:17.085
Oh, God, what's my life come to?

11:17.165 --> 11:22.245
Loads! I mean...
you have three wonderful children.

11:23.205 --> 11:24.965
I have two children that I like.

11:25.045 --> 11:27.485
-And a best buddy that loves you.
-Oh, God!

11:27.565 --> 11:29.565
Steve! The cavalry has arrived.

11:30.445 --> 11:33.525
-Ken's being a right old cranky pants.
-Leave it to me, Lorna.

11:37.565 --> 11:39.765
Black dog on your back, eh, Ken?

11:39.845 --> 11:44.885
Huh! Can't blame you.
I mean, look at you, worthless schmoo.

11:45.925 --> 11:48.245
Dick Dunderhead
who worked his life away for the Man

11:48.325 --> 11:49.925
and didn't even get a clock in return.

11:50.005 --> 11:51.525
Is this supposed to be a pep talk?

11:51.605 --> 11:53.525
I'm knocking you down, Ken,
to build you back up again

11:53.605 --> 11:57.005
because here is how we rebuild your mojo.

11:59.245 --> 12:00.645
Little venture I'm starting.

12:00.725 --> 12:03.285
Three words,
directed weaponised cocktailology.

12:04.325 --> 12:06.845
-You're opening a bar.
-It's more than a bar, you fool!

12:06.925 --> 12:09.445
It's a high-class cocktail lounge
for yuppies and babes.

12:09.525 --> 12:11.805
-And the name?
-Oh, this is going to be bad!

12:11.885 --> 12:13.605
All Steve's Pals.

12:13.685 --> 12:15.325
Wow! Worse than I expected.

12:15.405 --> 12:20.085
So, I combine my passion for strong drink
and my medical know-how. Et voilà!

12:20.165 --> 12:24.965
Bespoke cocktails laced with
Steve Chance's own brand of legal high!

12:25.925 --> 12:27.285
I'll play the boogie-woogie piano.

12:27.365 --> 12:28.765
I'll have to learn.

12:30.245 --> 12:33.005
Fuck! I just need a few thousand.

12:33.765 --> 12:36.685
-Interested?
-No! Not interested.

12:37.285 --> 12:40.605
Lichfield's sexy elite
do not want to buy their liquor

12:40.685 --> 12:42.165
from an insane puffin.

12:42.725 --> 12:44.005
Your loss, not mine.

12:48.205 --> 12:49.245
Fuck you, Ken!

12:52.645 --> 12:55.685
-[Lorna] <i>So, what do you think, Nina?</i>
<i>-Um, sorry.</i>

12:55.765 --> 13:00.805
You're asking if I can fix the Lawyer
Of The Year award so that Ken wins?

13:00.885 --> 13:03.125
Not fix. God, no - not fix!

13:03.205 --> 13:06.085
OK, only you asked if I could make sure
that Ken wins.

13:06.165 --> 13:09.605
-Sounds like fixing.
-It's just a silly award.

13:09.685 --> 13:12.685
The judges argued over it for days.

13:12.765 --> 13:14.725
There was a secret ballot.

13:14.805 --> 13:17.485
-So no one knows who won, do they?
-[sighs]

13:17.565 --> 13:20.205
I mean, it might as well be Ken
as anyone else,

13:20.285 --> 13:22.965
and you're always saying
what a friend he is to you.

13:23.045 --> 13:25.125
Yes, you're right.

13:25.205 --> 13:27.165
We're best friends.

13:27.245 --> 13:32.805
Nina, Ken's having a nightmare time
at work at the moment. Nightmare.

13:32.885 --> 13:36.285
-This might be just the fillip he needs.
-Ken needs a boost?

13:37.685 --> 13:38.845
Oh, why not?

13:40.205 --> 13:43.325
I'm loving this little female conspiracy.
[chuckles]

13:43.925 --> 13:48.205
Fear not, Lorna.
Ken will not go home empty-handed.

13:54.765 --> 13:57.045
-Ha!
-Ooh! Handsome!

13:57.125 --> 14:00.165
Thank you, love. I like to look nice
before I'm ritually humiliated.

14:00.245 --> 14:02.285
Oh, come on, glum boots!

14:02.365 --> 14:04.565
Who knows? You might still win.

14:04.645 --> 14:05.685
Right.

14:05.765 --> 14:07.605
-Where's Dale?
-He ran out earlier.

14:07.685 --> 14:09.805
-Are you going to be all right with Sid?
-Yeah, piece of piss.

14:10.565 --> 14:13.485
I'm letting him play on <i>Faceswipe</i>.
Kid's got good instincts.

14:14.245 --> 14:15.645
[phone beeps]

14:15.725 --> 14:17.845
Oh! Uber's here.

14:17.925 --> 14:20.285
Forward to public disgrace!

14:20.965 --> 14:23.205
-Bye, loves!
-See ya.

14:23.285 --> 14:25.445
No! Sid, don't swipe right for her!

14:26.485 --> 14:29.125
Ah, fair enough,
she'll probably do stuff.

14:29.205 --> 14:30.245
High five.

14:31.445 --> 14:33.085
Yeah! Good man!

14:38.645 --> 14:40.965
Welcome, messieurs, sit yourselves down.

14:41.845 --> 14:44.565
Steve? What, you're an Uber driver now?

14:44.645 --> 14:47.685
I always drove a taxi at night, Ken,
even when I was a doctor.

14:47.765 --> 14:49.245
[starts engine]

14:51.685 --> 14:53.365
[Steve] Sparkling water in the seat well.

14:53.445 --> 14:56.525
Travel stove and eggs,
if you want to fix yourselves an omelette.

14:56.605 --> 14:58.485
I think we're eating at the do, Steve.

14:59.685 --> 15:03.485
-Traditional Japanese Gyoku music.
-[music begins]

15:04.125 --> 15:06.845
So, Lorna, got a tasty business
proposition for you.

15:07.565 --> 15:11.725
Lichfield's premier cocktail bar -
All Steve's Pals.

15:11.805 --> 15:16.525
On one side of the bar, a sauna, and
on the other side, an ice-cream parlour.

15:16.605 --> 15:21.925
-Cold like my thinking, hot like my loins.
-Yeah, this concept's changed quite a lot.

15:22.005 --> 15:24.285
Ideas evolve, Ken.

15:24.365 --> 15:26.765
So, what do you say, Lorna? I'm talking
drinks that will take your head off

15:26.845 --> 15:30.165
-and girls which will blow your mind.
-Sorry, Steve. I'm out.

15:31.245 --> 15:35.165
No-star Uber rating for you, my friends.

15:35.245 --> 15:36.805
[turns music up]

15:36.885 --> 15:40.165
[Steve sings Japanese song quietly]

15:46.085 --> 15:47.405
[lounge music]

15:47.485 --> 15:50.405
Mm! Rachel, top-up time!

15:50.485 --> 15:54.645
Do you know what, all this talking really
looks like fun, but it's very hard work.

15:55.485 --> 15:58.445
Single-handedly keeping the whole event
ticking over, that's hard work, too.

15:58.525 --> 16:01.725
Oh, babes, one day, you will be the boss

16:01.805 --> 16:04.605
and you will really miss
all this stress and admin.

16:04.685 --> 16:07.285
OK, back to the coal face!

16:07.365 --> 16:09.765
Cos I am Network Nina!

16:09.845 --> 16:11.445
[both laugh loudly]

16:13.285 --> 16:16.925
Golly! Nina could use some pointers
on ground-level, integrational leadership.

16:17.005 --> 16:21.045
Dale! You absolute nutter!
What are you doing here?

16:21.125 --> 16:22.885
When you said there was
no way into this party,

16:22.965 --> 16:25.245
I recalled the book I read
called <i>Don't Take No For An Answer</i>.

16:25.325 --> 16:28.485
-You know what it's about?
-Some kind of sci-fi saga?

16:28.565 --> 16:32.205
No. It's about not taking no
for an answer. So here I am!

16:32.285 --> 16:34.805
Look at this place!
What a networking opportunity!

16:35.685 --> 16:38.165
Just as soon as I hit my stretch break
and I'm allowed to move.

16:38.245 --> 16:41.965
-Newbie! No talking!
-So sorry, my bad! Bye, Rach.

16:47.605 --> 16:49.205
[clears throat, taps glass]

16:49.285 --> 16:51.965
A toast to our nominees.

16:53.285 --> 16:57.245
Jane, you've been an inspiration
these last few months.

16:57.325 --> 17:01.845
Your leadership has helped us see
that a better world

17:01.925 --> 17:03.725
is within reach of us all.

17:04.365 --> 17:07.205
-To Jane!
-[all] To Jane!

17:07.285 --> 17:09.485
-Thank you.
-And also to Ken.

17:09.565 --> 17:12.324
Oh, thank you, Noel. Now Jane
can enjoy the rest of the ceremony

17:12.405 --> 17:14.084
with a perfectly clean rectum.

17:14.165 --> 17:16.725
Whoever wins,
it will be a triumph for the firm.

17:16.805 --> 17:19.405
-[tapping on mic]
-[Nina] Woo-hoo! Hello, everybody!

17:19.485 --> 17:22.805
Welcome! Well, what a night!

17:22.885 --> 17:25.525
I am having an absolute ball.

17:26.445 --> 17:29.045
Let's hear it for the human statues.

17:30.485 --> 17:31.885
[cheering]

17:35.005 --> 17:37.485
Now, let's break it down.

17:37.565 --> 17:40.725
-[tense music]
-Tonight is the night

17:40.805 --> 17:44.165
that Lichfield honours its heroes

17:44.245 --> 17:45.525
with awards like

17:45.605 --> 17:47.405
Best Chartered Surveyor!

17:49.325 --> 17:52.645
Foremost In-House Compliance Consultant!

17:54.725 --> 17:57.205
And, of course, the biggie!

17:58.005 --> 18:00.085
Lawyer Of The Year!

18:00.165 --> 18:02.565
[cheering]

18:02.645 --> 18:04.885
Go, Jane! Go, Jane!

18:05.725 --> 18:09.485
But before all of that,
let's take a short break.

18:12.845 --> 18:14.805
Oi, newbie! It's your break.
You've got 15 minutes.

18:16.325 --> 18:18.125
A top job in 15 minutes?

18:18.205 --> 18:19.605
You've got this, Dale!

18:22.125 --> 18:24.445
Hi, everyone, my name's Dale.

18:24.525 --> 18:26.445
Here's a business card.
Nice to meet you, sir.

18:26.525 --> 18:28.245
He's suddenly so keen to get a job.

18:28.325 --> 18:30.485
-Where's he got that idea from?
-Nowhere.

18:31.285 --> 18:32.245
Perfect!

18:32.325 --> 18:35.525
It probably just popped into his head.
Anyway, it's good for Dale.

18:35.605 --> 18:38.045
Maybe something in high finance.

18:38.125 --> 18:39.685
It's important to have a career.

18:39.765 --> 18:40.965
Is it?

18:41.045 --> 18:44.685
I don't know if I'm just drunk,
but your attitude is refreshing.

18:44.765 --> 18:47.245
-Thanks.
-There is your salary.

18:48.925 --> 18:51.165
Thank you, ma'am.
You will not be disappointed.

18:51.245 --> 18:55.005
This is the first step
in a very exciting... journ--

18:59.365 --> 19:01.965
What happened?
Did you paint yourself all over?

19:02.045 --> 19:05.085
Yeah, every last inch.
I wanted to be thorough.

19:05.165 --> 19:08.005
His skin's asphyxiating! Dickhead's
gone and done a Goldfinger!

19:08.085 --> 19:10.685
No, no, no, I'm OK.
I've got this. I'm fine.

19:10.765 --> 19:11.965
[shudders]

19:12.045 --> 19:14.285
-[crash]
-Oh, no! His skin needs to breathe.

19:14.365 --> 19:16.485
I need to take his trousers off now!

19:16.565 --> 19:19.045
-Oh, God!
-This might hurt, soldier.

19:19.645 --> 19:21.325
[Dale screams]

19:22.405 --> 19:24.285
Relax, guys, the worst is over.

19:24.365 --> 19:28.205
-I'll drive him to the hospital.
-Do you know what? We'll come with.

19:28.765 --> 19:30.285
I don't need to be here.

19:30.365 --> 19:31.365
Ken!

19:31.445 --> 19:34.245
-The award!
-What about it? I showed my face.

19:35.565 --> 19:36.965
You've won, OK?

19:37.045 --> 19:38.325
-What?
-You've won.

19:38.405 --> 19:40.285
I might have had a word with Nina.

19:40.845 --> 19:43.045
-I rigged it.
-You did what?

19:43.125 --> 19:46.125
[distant chanting] Ken! Ken! Ken!
Ken! Ken! Ken! Ken!

19:47.445 --> 19:50.605
Oh, you sneaky, beautiful wonder!

19:50.685 --> 19:55.125
Can't believe you, Mum!
Dale'll be fine! Go and face your public.

19:58.565 --> 20:00.525
And don't say anything stupid.

20:02.365 --> 20:06.645
Ken! Ken! Ken! Ken! Ken!
Ken! Ken! Ken!

20:07.485 --> 20:09.965
-Oh!
-Thank you! Thank you!

20:11.285 --> 20:15.405
Well, my wife said not to say anything
stupid, so I'll keep it brief.

20:15.485 --> 20:16.725
[laughter]

20:17.525 --> 20:23.445
Folks, working at Herbert Redcliffe
this past year has been a magical journey.

20:24.445 --> 20:28.885
And beside me on that magical journey,
my partners, ladies and gentlemen.

20:30.485 --> 20:33.285
Some months ago,
I went on paternity leave.

20:33.365 --> 20:36.485
I happen to be a proud feminist.

20:36.565 --> 20:39.205
-[applause]
-Yes, why not? Thank you.

20:39.285 --> 20:43.325
And while I was looking after my child
and my wife was working,

20:43.405 --> 20:48.085
who should be politicking
behind my back but Jane, the snake?

20:49.245 --> 20:52.365
Yes, Jane.
You have betrayed the sisterhood.

20:52.445 --> 20:55.165
You shower of shithouses!

20:56.165 --> 20:58.405
-It ends here!
-[taps table]

20:58.485 --> 21:03.525
You can't do without me now because I...
I'm Lawyer Of The Year.

21:04.445 --> 21:09.085
That's right. I, Ken Thompson,
am Lawyer Of The Year!

21:09.165 --> 21:12.565
Read it for yourselves.
I am the Tallest...

21:12.645 --> 21:14.245
[murmuring]

21:14.845 --> 21:16.965
Nina, there's a little mistake there,
I think.

21:17.045 --> 21:19.285
I think that should just say
Lawyer Of The Year.

21:19.365 --> 21:23.165
-No, Tallest.
-No, no, it's just Lawyer Of The Year.

21:23.245 --> 21:26.165
-[laughter]
-No, it's Tallest Lawyer Of The Year.

21:26.245 --> 21:29.485
It's an award I made up especially for you
because we're such good friends

21:29.565 --> 21:31.925
and I know that you were
feeling blue so...

21:32.005 --> 21:35.165
-What?
-Oh, come give me a hug, you big wombat!

21:35.245 --> 21:37.325
-[Nina laughs]
-[booing]

21:37.405 --> 21:39.565
You're very welcome.

21:39.645 --> 21:40.965
OK, so...

21:41.045 --> 21:42.325
Oh, wasn't that fun?

21:42.965 --> 21:48.325
And, um, the next award
is the Lichfield Lawyer Of The Year.

21:48.405 --> 21:53.205
So, the winner of the Lawyer Of The Year
is my best friend, Jane Defreitas!

21:53.285 --> 21:55.005
[cheering]

22:02.605 --> 22:03.805
It will blow over.

22:03.885 --> 22:05.325
It'll be fine.

22:05.405 --> 22:06.605
With these things,

22:06.685 --> 22:09.205
they always seem worse
than they actually are, you know.

22:09.805 --> 22:11.205
-Yeah!
-Totally.

22:14.005 --> 22:15.725
[drinks pouring]

22:15.805 --> 22:19.365
-Welcome home!
-Welcome home! Ha-ha!

22:19.445 --> 22:23.965
-Wow! Someone's feeling better!
-The kid just needed his blood cleaning.

22:24.045 --> 22:27.565
Nothing Uncle Steve couldn't do
with a petrol siphon and a colander.

22:27.645 --> 22:29.165
Yeah!

22:29.245 --> 22:31.245
Now, everyone has to have a drink.

22:32.165 --> 22:33.925
-For the award-winner!
-Shut up.

22:34.005 --> 22:35.845
Ooh, sad socks.
Did something go wrong?

22:35.925 --> 22:39.005
No, I'd just like to go to bed
in my house without you here.

22:39.085 --> 22:40.005
Well, no can do.

22:40.085 --> 22:42.045
Even if you don't take
any pleasure in your award,

22:42.125 --> 22:43.845
we still have something to toast.

22:43.925 --> 22:46.845
Oh, yes! We still have Dale's
new job to celebrate!

22:46.925 --> 22:50.685
Right, actually, um, update.
I'm not taking that job any more.

22:50.765 --> 22:52.365
What? How come?

22:53.285 --> 22:56.725
Well, let's just say
a better offer came along.

22:58.285 --> 23:01.565
-Oh! Oh, no!
-Why do I feel scared?

23:01.645 --> 23:03.085
Yep! [laughs]

23:03.165 --> 23:07.325
You are looking at the 49% owner
of All Dale & Steve's Pals!

23:07.405 --> 23:09.045
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, fuck!

23:09.125 --> 23:10.685
We had a few cocktails
when I was cleaning his blood.

23:10.765 --> 23:11.765
This is Steve's.

23:11.845 --> 23:14.165
-I pitched Dale the idea, and he loved it.
-Yes.

23:14.245 --> 23:16.125
Dale, what about your actual job?

23:16.205 --> 23:19.685
Oh, that job means nothing.
I mean, 50K? What good is a K to me?

23:20.245 --> 23:22.685
This way, I get paid
in good old British pounds!

23:22.765 --> 23:25.445
OK. We should probably
talk about this.

23:25.525 --> 23:27.285
We're going to be talking about it a lot,
my love!

23:27.365 --> 23:29.965
After all, it is where I invested
my entire savings.

23:30.045 --> 23:32.285
Steve's already got the lease.

23:32.365 --> 23:36.205
Dale! We were supposed to be saving
for a deposit, getting out of here!

23:36.285 --> 23:37.485
Yes, you were!

23:37.565 --> 23:39.125
Actually, I had the same concern at first,

23:39.205 --> 23:43.405
but then I talked to Steve and he said,
actually, it's a sure and certain bet.

23:44.085 --> 23:46.925
-So, peace of mind.
-Peace of mind.

23:47.805 --> 23:51.005
-A drink to our success! Rachel?

-Yep.

23:53.525 --> 23:56.165

Oh, God! Ooh!

24:06.885 --> 24:09.325
