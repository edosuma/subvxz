00:06.250 --> 00:07.333
Do you see what I see?

00:07.959 --> 00:11.417
[chuckles] It's a cloud in the shape
of a rabbit. Cute.

00:11.500 --> 00:12.959
No. Lower.

00:13.166 --> 00:15.500
[giggles] A rabbit in the shape
of a cloud, even cuter.

00:15.583 --> 00:17.166
Higher.

00:18.792 --> 00:20.125
Nick with a goofy smile on his face.

00:22.834 --> 00:25.125
Nick with a goofy smile on his face?

00:26.083 --> 00:27.834
Now that's something
you don't see every day.

00:27.917 --> 00:29.792
Are you kidding?
I love golf.

00:29.875 --> 00:32.417
My dad taught me.
So you're... you're into it, too?

00:32.500 --> 00:35.917
It's like my favorite sport. You know,
not a lot of people appreciate golf.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.125
What's your favorite
part of the game?

00:37.208 --> 00:40.375
Hitting the ball through the clown's mouth
and watching it come out his pants.

00:41.500 --> 00:44.750
-I'm kidding.
-Good.

00:44.875 --> 00:46.834
That's good.
All right, see you in class.

00:46.917 --> 00:47.959
See, ya.

00:53.291 --> 00:54.959
[snaps]
Hey, guys.

00:55.125 --> 00:57.166
-So, what's her name?
-Whose name?

00:57.250 --> 00:59.000
-The girl you're crushing on.
-Crushing?

00:59.083 --> 01:01.875
What are you, 11?
I think her name was, like, Jenny or...

01:03.333 --> 01:05.041
Penny... or something.

01:05.125 --> 01:07.250
-Here we go again.
-What are you talking about?

01:07.333 --> 01:09.792
Nick, you always
fall too hard too fast.

01:09.875 --> 01:12.458
It's like you meet a girl,
then boom, instant love.

01:12.542 --> 01:15.458
Then boom, you get dumped.
And then boom, broken heart.

01:15.542 --> 01:17.667
And me and Kevin are there
picking up the pieces.

01:18.041 --> 01:19.709
"Oh, it's Nick's broken heart."

01:19.792 --> 01:21.333
All right, that happened,
like, one time.

01:21.417 --> 01:23.333
-[both] six times.
-All right, you know what?

01:23.417 --> 01:26.333
Don't worry, because I'm taking things
nice and slow.

01:32.041 --> 01:35.333
There was like 100 pictures of her
in his locker, right?

01:37.041 --> 01:38.458
That's what we thought.

02:37.875 --> 02:39.417
Joe's gonna wear this?
[gasping]

02:39.500 --> 02:41.083
Yeah.
And I want to see if--

02:41.166 --> 02:43.667
Joe's gonna put his arms
through these sleeves?

02:43.750 --> 02:46.375
And his hands are gonna
come out of these holes.

02:52.875 --> 02:54.542
-Macy!
-How long was I out?

02:54.625 --> 02:57.250
So, you know how crazed fans
sometimes go after Kevin, Joe and Nick,

02:57.333 --> 02:59.166
and rip and tear their clothes
to get a little souvenir?

02:59.250 --> 03:02.000
[gasps] I couldn't help it!
Nick was standing so close.

03:02.083 --> 03:03.500
I had to have a piece of him,
so I grabbed--

03:03.583 --> 03:05.250
Macy, that was you?

03:05.792 --> 03:07.375
[sighs]

03:11.500 --> 03:15.375
You see?
A perfectly good shirt... ruined.

03:16.166 --> 03:19.834
This is why I created
a new line of clothing I like to call,

03:19.917 --> 03:23.125
"Stellcro."
Patent pending.

03:23.417 --> 03:27.625
Now when an overly excited fan
grabs at the guys' jackets,

03:27.709 --> 03:30.875
the sleeve will just...
break away.

03:31.083 --> 03:35.000
Then, instead of throwing out a beautiful
and expensive garment...

03:36.000 --> 03:37.667
all I have to do...

03:39.792 --> 03:41.834
is replace the sleeve.

03:41.917 --> 03:43.917
Voilà!

03:44.000 --> 03:45.750
Less work for Stella.

03:45.834 --> 03:49.083
More sleeve for Macy.
[giggles]

03:49.417 --> 03:52.041
I'm sorry.
Do you see what I see?

03:54.583 --> 03:57.875
Weird. That guy looks
just like Nick except he's smiling.

03:57.959 --> 03:59.542
It is Nick.

04:00.208 --> 04:03.166
And he's more than smiling, he's smitten.

04:04.166 --> 04:05.667
Aww.

04:06.458 --> 04:09.875
And just when my gossip tank
was running on empty.

04:11.542 --> 04:14.667
I mean, how crazy is it
that you love golf and play guitar?

04:14.750 --> 04:17.291
I... I just can't believe I'm even
playing in front of you right now.

04:17.375 --> 04:19.000

-I'm there.

04:27.083 --> 04:29.333
OK.
Suddenly, I'm nervous.

04:29.625 --> 04:32.458
Look, the trick is just look
really bored while you play.

04:32.542 --> 04:34.417
Then the audience thinks you
really know what you're doing.

04:34.500 --> 04:35.750

04:45.792 --> 04:48.417
OK, so what's the trick
to recording my first demo?

04:48.500 --> 04:50.959
-Do it in our studio.
-Are... are you serious?

04:51.041 --> 04:52.500
Of course.

04:52.583 --> 04:55.625
I mean, read the fan magazines.
I'm the serious one.

04:55.709 --> 04:57.542

Thank you.

05:02.250 --> 05:04.333
Look at them all cozy in there.

05:04.417 --> 05:07.000
It would just be so rude of us to butt in.

05:07.083 --> 05:08.625
Oh, we've definitely got to do this.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.250
-Let's do it.
-OK.

05:11.166 --> 05:12.667
-What's up?
-Oh, Nick?

05:12.750 --> 05:14.333
-Didn't see you out here.
-Oh, really?

05:14.417 --> 05:16.792
Because this whole thing is glass
and we're the only two people here.

05:16.875 --> 05:18.375
This is glass?

05:18.458 --> 05:22.083
And you must be Penny.
We've heard so much about you.

05:22.166 --> 05:24.583
-No, they haven't.
-All Captain McHappy can talk about

05:24.667 --> 05:26.750
-is how wonderful you are.
-No, I don't.

05:26.834 --> 05:29.500
-It's nonstop.
-No, it's not.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.125
I apologize for their juvenile behavior.

05:32.208 --> 05:35.166
Hey, I can apologize for my own
juvenile behavior, thank you very much.

05:35.250 --> 05:37.583
-Are these clowns bothering you?
-Yes.

05:37.667 --> 05:39.000
[both]
No!

05:39.083 --> 05:41.959
Leave the guy alone.
He's hanging with a friend.

05:42.041 --> 05:44.041
I think he deserves a little privacy.

05:44.125 --> 05:46.959
-OK.
-See you at home, Captain McHappy.

05:47.834 --> 05:50.041
Hey, I came up with that.

05:50.417 --> 05:52.875
-Thanks, Stell.
-Yeah, it's no problem.

05:53.333 --> 05:55.583
OK, so tell me everything.
Don't leave anything out.

05:55.667 --> 05:57.625
Nothing is too personal.
Start at the very beginning.

05:57.709 --> 05:59.166
-Where did you two meet?
-Stella!

05:59.250 --> 06:02.000
-It was so great meeting you.
-You, too.

This feels a little stiff.

Oh, yeah, I know. I'm still trying
to work on a softer thread for the seam.

06:26.583 --> 06:28.792
Oh, I know.
I know. OK.

06:28.875 --> 06:30.375

Which one should I be? [chuckles]

Or maybe Kevin!

just follow them around all day?

06:56.291 --> 06:59.875

-I'm not.
-Dude, you wrote her a song.

-Six times total.

-Pretty sure. Yeah.

12:56.875 --> 12:58.333

-Wow.

12:58.417 --> 13:01.959

of the school bus and passed 22 girls

Ho-ho! Boom!

-Anyway, look.

-No.
