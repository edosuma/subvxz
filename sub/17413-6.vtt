WEBVTT

00:07.429 --> 00:09.847
Trish, we have a
Glee club emergency.

00:11.516 --> 00:12.893
Our tenor, Lenny, was
chased by a dog,

00:12.917 --> 00:14.768
fell off his bike,
and broke his leg.

00:14.803 --> 00:16.603
Oh, great!

00:16.638 --> 00:18.605
That means we don't
have to rehearse today.

00:18.640 --> 00:22.776
Man, dogs really are
man's best friend.

00:22.811 --> 00:24.594
Have some sympathy.

00:24.612 --> 00:26.457
Yeah, poor Lenny's probably
gonna be on crutches

00:26.481 --> 00:27.564
for six weeks.

00:27.598 --> 00:29.817
I mean sympathy for me.

00:29.868 --> 00:31.601
Without a tenor, there's no way

00:31.619 --> 00:33.704
we'll win next
week's competition.

00:33.738 --> 00:35.605
We might end up in

00:35.623 --> 00:36.824
Second place.

00:38.576 --> 00:40.577
Second place still qualifies you

00:40.611 --> 00:41.712
for regionals.

00:41.746 --> 00:43.881
Oh, but second place
is not winning.

00:43.915 --> 00:46.783
Second place means
you're a loser.

00:46.801 --> 00:49.720
Hey, I come in second
place all the time.

00:49.754 --> 00:51.839
Would you guys call me a loser?

00:52.891 --> 00:54.925
Do you really want
me to answer that?

00:54.959 --> 00:57.461
Probably not.

00:58.813 --> 01:01.631
I have to fix this.
I'm the captain.

01:01.649 --> 01:03.650
When there's a problem, the
whole club looks to me

01:03.685 --> 01:05.635
to be calm, cool, and collected.

01:06.738 --> 01:08.856
Maybe they should
look somewhere else.

01:12.494 --> 01:15.412
I see what's going on.

01:15.447 --> 01:16.757
She's afflicted with
a rare condition

01:16.781 --> 01:18.699
called "a capella persperitis,"

01:18.750 --> 01:20.701
better known as

01:20.752 --> 01:22.503
"Glee fever!"

01:23.621 --> 01:24.821
I kind of have a
touch of it myself,

01:24.839 --> 01:26.707
but I'll never get cured

01:26.758 --> 01:28.542
since I didn't get picked
to be in Glee club.

01:31.880 --> 01:34.548
I'd give you my spot if I
didn't need the extra credits.

01:34.599 --> 01:35.799
I tried wood shop,

01:35.833 --> 01:37.684
but apparently it's "dangerous"

01:37.719 --> 01:39.803
to fall asleep while
operating a buzz saw.

01:40.838 --> 01:42.506
Focus.

01:42.524 --> 01:44.691
We need to find a last minute
replacement for Lenny.

01:44.726 --> 01:46.843
He needs to be a strong
singer who can learn fast.

01:46.861 --> 01:49.446
Where are you gonna find that?

01:49.481 --> 01:53.683
♪ She'll be coming around the
Mountain when she comes. ♪

01:53.701 --> 01:55.569
Dez! Shh.

01:55.620 --> 01:56.620
We're trying to think.

01:57.688 --> 01:58.799
You also need someone
with charisma

01:58.823 --> 01:59.907
and good dance moves.

01:59.958 --> 02:01.542
Who do we know?

02:07.799 --> 02:10.417
Gosh, what's wrong with us?

02:10.467 --> 02:12.386
We already know the
perfect person.

02:12.420 --> 02:13.537
Of course.

02:13.555 --> 02:15.722
He's been right in front
of us the whole time.

02:15.757 --> 02:17.674
Ally, it would be my honor.

02:17.708 --> 02:18.725
Austin!

02:18.760 --> 02:20.644
You should be in Glee club.

02:20.678 --> 02:21.678
Why not?

02:21.712 --> 02:22.856
Since you can't
find anyone else.

02:22.880 --> 02:24.681
- Yeah.
- All right, cool.

02:24.715 --> 02:25.732

03:28.779 --> 03:31.665
Say hi to your new teammate,
pop star Austin moon.

03:31.716 --> 03:33.417
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:33.451 --> 03:35.419
Hi. I'm Elle,

03:35.453 --> 03:36.453
and single.

03:36.471 --> 03:39.623
Uh, nice to meet you.

03:39.641 --> 03:41.625
You're Austin moon.

03:41.643 --> 03:43.727
I can't believe
you're talking to me.

03:43.761 --> 03:44.761
Huh?!

03:49.517 --> 03:50.767
Oh.

03:50.801 --> 03:51.818
Okay.

03:51.853 --> 03:53.570
Hi. I'm...

03:53.605 --> 03:54.832
Just so you know, I'm not a fan.

03:54.856 --> 03:57.524
I hate pop music, and popcorn,

03:57.575 --> 03:58.609
and soda pop.

03:58.643 --> 03:59.826
Anything with a pop in it.

04:01.646 --> 04:03.447
Nice to meet you too?

04:03.481 --> 04:05.616
That's b.B. She
hates everything.

04:05.650 --> 04:06.750
Why is she in Glee club?

04:06.784 --> 04:08.785
She hates not being
in Glee club.

04:10.505 --> 04:12.456
Austin's really gonna
help our club.

04:12.490 --> 04:13.590
He's 6'1",

04:13.625 --> 04:15.792
170, has a five octave range,

04:15.826 --> 04:18.512
and he bench presses 175 pounds.

04:18.546 --> 04:20.764
Thanks, but what does that
have to do with Glee club?

04:20.798 --> 04:22.683
He's also the wrestling coach.

04:22.717 --> 04:24.668
He loves music and headlocks.

04:26.688 --> 04:27.854
You're so strong.

04:27.889 --> 04:29.806
And cute. Did I
mention I was single?

04:29.840 --> 04:30.857
Back off, Elle.

04:30.892 --> 04:32.643
Austin,

04:32.677 --> 04:33.694
welcome to the team.

04:33.728 --> 04:35.395
Happy to be here, coach.

04:35.446 --> 04:36.846
I love performing
with my friends.

04:36.864 --> 04:39.516
Hmm. With some of your friends.

04:42.487 --> 04:44.655
Okay, I'm gonna
turn over rehearsal

04:44.689 --> 04:46.406
to our captain.

04:46.457 --> 04:47.691
What's our motto?

04:47.709 --> 04:50.661
Be strong, be loud, b-sharp!

04:50.695 --> 04:52.579
I didn't hear you, Miles.

04:52.630 --> 04:55.415
Be strong, be loud, b-sharp.

04:55.466 --> 04:57.501
We'll work on that.

04:57.535 --> 04:59.553
Okay, everybody. Line
up for "heart beat."

04:59.587 --> 05:00.537
Oh, Austin.

05:00.555 --> 05:01.722
I'll show you your part.

05:01.756 --> 05:02.839
Oh, I already know it.

05:02.873 --> 05:04.541
Dez taught me all the
routines during lunch.

05:04.559 --> 05:05.809
He's got most of it down,

05:05.843 --> 05:07.728
but I still think
that a kick-step

05:07.762 --> 05:09.713
would work better than a twirl.

05:09.731 --> 05:12.566
Thanks, Dez, but I'm the captain

05:12.600 --> 05:13.883
and you're not on the team.

05:13.901 --> 05:16.737
You wouldn't want me sweeping
up the gym floor, would you?

05:16.771 --> 05:18.438
Kind of.

05:23.528 --> 05:25.495
♪ I can get your
heart beat beat ♪

05:25.530 --> 05:26.730

05:39.711 --> 05:41.511
Bravo.

05:41.546 --> 05:42.796
That was perfect.

05:42.847 --> 05:44.715
Great. Now we can go home.

05:44.749 --> 05:47.434
No way. Rehearsal's
just starting.

05:47.468 --> 05:48.635
Austin,

05:48.686 --> 05:50.854
you sounded great. Just
more smiling next time.

05:50.888 --> 05:52.723
Cool. And I was
thinking we could

05:52.757 --> 05:54.558
make a few changes
to the routine

05:54.592 --> 05:55.912
since it's a little
old-fashioned.

06:01.783 --> 06:03.700
Old-fashioned?

06:03.735 --> 06:06.703
I wouldn't call it that.
Maybe "traditional,"

06:06.738 --> 06:07.848
but that's what judges look for.

06:07.872 --> 06:10.490
Okay, bad choice of words.

06:10.541 --> 06:12.609
What I meant was, we
should rock things up.

06:12.627 --> 06:14.378
Make it a little edgier.

06:14.412 --> 06:17.781
Oh, you want to add a little
shaky-shaky-boom-boom?

06:19.584 --> 06:21.385
Yeah, that's not what I meant.

06:21.419 --> 06:22.552
I hope not.

06:22.587 --> 06:24.504
I never want to see that again.

06:24.555 --> 06:26.640
It was just a thought.

06:26.674 --> 06:27.841
Keep your mind open.

06:27.892 --> 06:29.476
Trust me.

06:29.510 --> 06:30.644
I know what I'm doing.

06:30.678 --> 06:33.814
There's no way we'll
lose this competition.

06:33.848 --> 06:35.816
I can't believe we
lost that competition.

06:37.685 --> 06:40.437
But the important thing
is that we participated.

06:40.471 --> 06:42.739
That's all I'm required
to do to get my credit.

06:42.774 --> 06:44.441
Ally, can you initial this?

06:45.610 --> 06:48.412
And it's cool that
you got a trophy

06:48.446 --> 06:50.557
that'll prove to your mom that
five years of singing lessons

06:50.581 --> 06:52.416
weren't a waste of money.

06:52.450 --> 06:53.817
I'm keeping this.

06:55.503 --> 06:57.654
Hey, at least we
qualified for regionals.

06:57.672 --> 06:59.706
Next time, we just
need to do dance moves

06:59.757 --> 07:00.757
people have heard of.

07:01.793 --> 07:03.677
Who hasn't heard
of the Charleston

07:03.711 --> 07:05.345
and the lindy hop?

07:05.379 --> 07:06.596
- Me.
- Never in my life.

07:08.549 --> 07:11.501
What if we did cooler dance moves
to a new song arrangement?

07:11.519 --> 07:13.804
♪ I can get your heart beat

07:13.838 --> 07:17.524

07:17.558 --> 07:19.526
Whoo! My heart's

07:20.645 --> 07:22.646
I vote we do it his way.

07:22.680 --> 07:23.697
Okay.

07:23.731 --> 07:25.482
There's no voting

07:25.516 --> 07:26.650
because I'm the captain.

07:26.684 --> 07:29.536
And that's not what
a capella is about,

07:29.570 --> 07:30.704
right, sun hee?

07:36.694 --> 07:38.712
She thinks I'm right.

07:38.746 --> 07:41.548
Ally, I know how important
this is to you.

07:41.582 --> 07:43.550
That's why I'm
making suggestions.

07:43.584 --> 07:44.701
I want you to win.

07:44.719 --> 07:46.703
Are you sure it's not

07:46.721 --> 07:48.722
because you're a famous pop star

07:48.756 --> 07:51.808
and think you know better than
the captain of the Glee club?

07:51.843 --> 07:54.478
I didn't say that, but me on.

07:54.512 --> 07:55.812
I do know a few things.

07:55.847 --> 07:58.482
I've performed on a lot
more stages than you.

08:05.573 --> 08:06.773
Guys, let's not fight.

08:06.824 --> 08:09.526
We're losing focus
of the real issue.

08:09.560 --> 08:11.778
I should be on the team.

08:11.829 --> 08:13.580
Not gonna happen, Dez.

08:14.749 --> 08:15.832
Look, Ally,

08:15.867 --> 08:17.534
I don't want to upset you,

08:17.568 --> 08:19.402
but I kind of agree with Austin.

08:20.588 --> 08:21.838
I'm not upset.

08:21.873 --> 08:24.508
Why would I be upset
that my two best friends

08:24.542 --> 08:25.742
are stabbing me in the back?

08:25.760 --> 08:27.427
Oh, phew.

08:27.461 --> 08:28.821
I thought you were
gonna be upset.

08:30.548 --> 08:32.849
If you and Mr. superstar
stage performer

08:32.884 --> 08:34.717
know so much,

08:34.751 --> 08:36.602
why don't you two start
your own Glee club?

08:36.636 --> 08:38.688
Maybe we will.

08:38.722 --> 08:39.688
Who's with us?

08:39.724 --> 08:41.441
Me! I'm with you.

08:41.475 --> 08:44.561
In sickness and in health. I do.

08:44.595 --> 08:45.729
Okay.

08:45.763 --> 08:47.447
Elle's joining my team.

08:47.481 --> 08:49.616
And scaring me.

08:49.650 --> 08:51.568
Who do you choose, Miles?

08:51.602 --> 08:52.652
Austin.

08:52.703 --> 08:54.437
- What?
- Austin.

08:54.455 --> 08:55.572
- What?
- Austin.

08:55.606 --> 08:56.606
Oh, just take him.

09:04.498 --> 09:08.335
Oh, man. She picked you.

09:08.386 --> 09:09.452
Yes.

09:09.470 --> 09:10.754
What about you, b. B.?

09:10.788 --> 09:12.622
I hate the way you run things,

09:12.640 --> 09:14.341
I hate your Glee fever,

09:14.392 --> 09:15.508
I even hate your hair.

09:16.811 --> 09:19.479
So it looks like she's with me.

09:19.513 --> 09:20.764
Oh, no. I'm staying with Ally.

09:20.798 --> 09:22.482
I hate change even more.

09:24.602 --> 09:25.652
Ha.

09:25.686 --> 09:27.404
You guys sure you
want to break up?

09:27.438 --> 09:28.405
You've been partners forever,

09:28.439 --> 09:29.639
and you've been friends fover.

09:29.657 --> 09:30.717
I don't want to work with them.

09:30.741 --> 09:32.409
And I don't want
to work with her.

09:32.443 --> 09:33.743
Me neither.

09:33.745 --> 09:35.662
You do realize that
only one Glee club

09:35.696 --> 09:37.664
can represent our
school at regionals?

09:37.698 --> 09:39.783
Well, I guess we know
what that means.

09:39.817 --> 09:41.418
Yep.

those wannabes.

10:31.542 --> 10:32.659

10:38.332 --> 10:39.666

club four days.

12:57.388 --> 12:58.671
Trying to get Miles
to sing loudly

12:58.689 --> 13:00.223
feels like a lifetime.

13:00.274 --> 13:03.276
He's right.

13:03.310 --> 13:05.445
Well, you both should
have thought of that

13:05.479 --> 13:06.623
before you started
this whole mess.

13:06.647 --> 13:08.231
Now get out of here.

13:48.572 --> 13:50.407
Uh, everything.

13:50.441 --> 13:51.585
We need to find new costumes,

13:51.609 --> 13:52.692
tighten our harmonies,

13:52.726 --> 13:55.412
get matching haircuts.

13:55.446 --> 13:57.497

the new captain.

Miles so upset.

14:07.574 --> 14:10.293
This is all your fault, Dez.

14:10.344 --> 14:11.544
Who made you captain anyway?

14:11.578 --> 14:13.379
Well, he who holds e thtch pipe

14:13.413 --> 14:14.547
has the power.

14:19.520 --> 14:21.688
Thank you, sun hee.

Why can't you all be
supportive like her?

14:36.537 --> 14:38.655
All right, Trish. Now you try.

14:40.324 --> 14:41.524
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

14:43.377 --> 14:44.577
Dez, I have an idea.

14:44.611 --> 14:45.611
Ly, please,

14:45.629 --> 14:46.723
I don't come over
there and tell you

14:46.747 --> 14:48.581
how to sweep the floor.

14:48.615 --> 14:51.417
But just so you know,
you missed a spot.

14:56.290 --> 14:58.675
Just promise me the b-sharps
will win regionals.

14:58.726 --> 15:00.560
I might not be in Glee club,

15:00.594 --> 15:02.345
but it's still a
part of my life.

15:02.396 --> 15:04.597
Aww. That's so sweet.

15:04.631 --> 15:06.599
But we're not the
b-sharps anymore.

15:06.633 --> 15:09.486
We're the Dez-tones.

15:09.520 --> 15:11.354
Whatever your name is,

15:11.405 --> 15:12.471
just win.

15:12.490 --> 15:14.491
You're my only hope.

15:16.410 --> 15:18.194
Kick-step, kick-step.

15:21.315 --> 15:22.499
Okay.

15:22.533 --> 15:24.250
There goes my hope.

15:34.378 --> 15:36.329
Ally, we need you
back in Glee club.

15:36.363 --> 15:37.714
I can't take Dez anymore.

15:37.748 --> 15:41.501
, look who's come crawling back.

15:41.535 --> 15:42.552
I'm sorry.

15:42.586 --> 15:44.554
I just wanted to win.

15:44.588 --> 15:46.339
But the only way
that's gonna happen

15:46.373 --> 15:47.557
is if you and Austin make up.

15:47.591 --> 15:49.675
Even if I wanted to come back,

15:49.709 --> 15:51.511
what about coach Simmons?

15:51.545 --> 15:53.730
He'll probably make us wrestle
to get back on the team.

15:53.764 --> 15:55.598
I know I look tough,

15:55.649 --> 15:58.401
but I don't want people
to find out that I'm not.

15:59.520 --> 16:01.604
That'll be our little secret.

16:01.655 --> 16:03.389
Leave the coach to me.

16:03.407 --> 16:05.491
So will you come back?

16:05.526 --> 16:08.461

catch Glee fever again.

16:08.495 --> 16:10.396
Are you sure?

16:10.414 --> 16:12.281
It's contagious.

16:12.332 --> 16:14.233
That's not gonna work.

16:14.251 --> 16:15.585
Ohh.

16:15.619 --> 16:17.236
I don't know.

16:17.254 --> 16:18.504
I think it's spreading.

16:18.539 --> 16:21.290
Wait. I do feel something.

16:21.341 --> 16:22.425
Uh-huh.

16:22.459 --> 16:23.520
My fingers are
starting to tingle.

16:23.544 --> 16:25.595

- My hands are getting jazzy.

16:25.629 --> 16:27.713
- Oh, no.
- Trish, call the doctor.

16:27.747 --> 16:29.348

wrote it together.

16:45.282 --> 16:48.267
Yeah. Everything's better
when we work together.

16:48.285 --> 16:49.535
I know.

16:49.570 --> 16:51.437
I'm sorry I split up the club.

16:51.455 --> 16:53.272
But when you were captain

16:53.290 --> 16:55.274
How can I put this nicely?

16:55.292 --> 16:57.610
You were an annoying
control freak.

16:57.628 --> 16:59.662
That's nicely?

16:59.713 --> 17:02.448
Sorry. But it's true.

17:02.466 --> 17:03.666
Sorry again.

17:03.717 --> 17:05.635
What's so controlling

17:05.669 --> 17:07.336
about wanting everything my way

17:07.387 --> 17:09.422
and not listening to
anyone else's ideas?

17:11.258 --> 17:12.340
Okay.

17:12.392 --> 17:13.459
When I say it out loud,

17:13.477 --> 17:14.477
it does sound pretty bad.

17:16.313 --> 17:18.481
Look, it wasn't all your fault.

17:18.515 --> 17:21.400
I should have known I was
stepping on your toes.

17:21.435 --> 17:23.569
But I was just trying to help.

17:23.604 --> 17:25.570
I know.

17:25.606 --> 17:28.406
You know why I'm so
crazy about Glee club?

17:28.442 --> 17:30.576
It's the one thing where
I get to do everything.

17:30.611 --> 17:32.578
The music, the choreography,

17:32.613 --> 17:34.363
it's all mine.

17:34.414 --> 17:35.498
I get it.

17:35.532 --> 17:37.583
That's what I get to
do with my concerts.

17:37.618 --> 17:40.453
Only I'm not an
annoying control freak.

17:41.622 --> 17:44.423
That's not what your band says.

17:46.426 --> 17:48.327
So what do you say
we get back together

17:48.345 --> 17:49.462
and go win regionals?

17:49.496 --> 17:50.546
We'll do it your way.

17:50.597 --> 17:52.682
No.

17:52.716 --> 17:54.300
We'll do it our way.

17:54.334 --> 17:56.302
But I thought Glee club
had to be all yours.

17:56.336 --> 17:57.637
Forget that. I want to win.

17:57.671 --> 17:59.522
Yeah, me too. Let's do this.

18:05.479 --> 18:08.314
Coach, regionals
are this weekend.

18:08.348 --> 18:10.366
We need new costumes,
wireless mics,

18:10.400 --> 18:11.651
way more body glitter.

18:11.685 --> 18:13.486
Son, if I gave you any
more body glitter,

18:13.520 --> 18:14.687
you'd look like a disco ball.

18:14.705 --> 18:17.523
Ah, that reminds me.
We need a disco ball.

18:17.541 --> 18:20.543
Coach, I wanted to talk to you
about letting Austin and Ally

18:20.577 --> 18:22.461

18:22.496 --> 18:23.529
They're in.

fool away from me.
