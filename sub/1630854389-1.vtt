WEBVTT

01:04.431 --> 01:05.733
Come on.

01:07.100 --> 01:09.637
Come on, come on, come on.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.703
- Brian.
- Hi, Miss Reif.

03:22.402 --> 03:25.671
- Is your mom running late?
- Yeah.

03:25.673 --> 03:29.777
- Oh! Well, you don't have
to sit out here all alone.

03:30.044 --> 03:31.577
You know, next time she's late,

03:31.579 --> 03:33.981
come see me in your old
classroom, right?

03:34.448 --> 03:36.450
You know, we can start
your homework...

03:36.818 --> 03:38.718
go over history lessons, yeah?

03:38.720 --> 03:40.553
- Yeah. What's that?

03:40.555 --> 03:45.292
- Oh, this is a surprise for
my friends that I'm meeting.

03:45.760 --> 03:47.593
Do you want to see it?
- Yeah, sure.

03:49.964 --> 03:53.601
Well, that looks good.

03:53.968 --> 03:55.668
- Hey, put that phone away.

03:55.670 --> 03:58.369
I mean, you still like
reading, don't you?

03:58.371 --> 04:01.976
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Well, I...

04:02.677 --> 04:05.644
just finished my first
children's book.

04:05.646 --> 04:07.648
And I want you to be
the first to read it.

04:08.448 --> 04:11.984
- "Little Snow was a smart
and a happy little puppy.

04:11.986 --> 04:14.452
He had a beautiful coat of fur.

04:24.464 --> 04:26.832
...nice and smart
and happy too."

04:26.834 --> 04:28.268
- Hey, Brian.

04:29.070 --> 04:30.538
Do you see that janitor inside?

04:30.972 --> 04:32.339
- Yeah.

04:32.673 --> 04:35.574
I want you to go up to
her and tell her

04:35.576 --> 04:39.013
that she is not to mop the
floors until after you leave.

04:39.379 --> 04:43.416
You could've slipped
and really hurt yourself.

04:45.318 --> 04:48.589
I need you to be a big
man here, you know?

04:49.123 --> 04:52.325
Teach people how to respect you.
Stand up for yourself.

04:53.060 --> 04:54.327
Go on.

04:54.629 --> 04:56.463
Go on. I'll be right here.

05:16.050 --> 05:18.019
- Hi.
- Hey.

05:19.520 --> 05:20.755
- What's he doing?

05:21.454 --> 05:24.723
- That woman was mopping
right where he was walking.

05:24.725 --> 05:28.027
He almost slipped
and really hurt himself.

05:28.029 --> 05:30.665
- Oh, God.
- I know.

05:31.364 --> 05:34.633
- Well, he's such
a sweet kid, right?

05:34.635 --> 05:36.434
And he's the first to help
his classmates

05:36.436 --> 05:39.505
when they're struggling and
it's just, with kids like him,

05:39.507 --> 05:42.775
I really try and get them
to be assertive.

05:42.777 --> 05:44.444
Stand up for themselves.

05:44.779 --> 05:46.946
Especially when it involves
their safety.

05:46.948 --> 05:49.982
Right, okay. Thank you.

05:49.984 --> 05:51.752
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, honey.

05:52.186 --> 05:53.819
I'm sorry, I'm late.

05:53.821 --> 05:55.921
- I'm tired.
- I know, buddy.

05:55.923 --> 05:57.959
Go get your stuff,
we'll go home, okay?

05:59.527 --> 06:01.126
- Thank you for keeping
him company.

06:01.128 --> 06:03.764
- No problem.
- You're gonna make a great mom.

06:06.801 --> 06:08.368
- Thanks.

06:09.070 --> 06:10.603
- Thank you.
Have such a good night.

06:10.605 --> 06:11.839
- You too.

06:13.975 --> 06:17.778
Hey, Brian. Don't play too
many video games, okay?

06:18.145 --> 06:19.680
- Okay. Bye.

07:28.015 --> 07:30.582
<i>- This is a prepaid call from...</i>

07:30.584 --> 07:32.084
- Jeff.

07:32.086 --> 07:35.254
<i>- ...an inmate at the County</i>

07:35.256 --> 07:38.757

10:06.575 --> 10:07.975
Hello?

10:11.178 --> 10:12.279
Hello.

10:13.647 --> 10:14.748
Hi.

10:15.082 --> 10:16.250
Hi.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.956
I'm sorry.
Can I help you?

10:22.123 --> 10:23.924
- Oh, no. I'm good.
Thanks.

10:25.659 --> 10:27.259
- Yeah, are you lost?

10:27.261 --> 10:30.297
- No. I'm just meeting a friend.

10:31.665 --> 10:33.901
- Okay. Who's your friend?

10:34.902 --> 10:36.036
- Kim.

10:36.904 --> 10:39.771
- Oh!

10:39.773 --> 10:42.176
I'm sorry. I'm meeting Kim too.

10:42.977 --> 10:44.044
- Why?

10:44.311 --> 10:47.948
- No, I organized the meeting.
The get-together.

10:48.482 --> 10:51.116
- Oh!
- Yeah.

10:51.118 --> 10:53.318
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.053
- It's good.
- Yeah, she mentioned to me

10:55.055 --> 10:57.791
that she was... she was inviting
someone else, um...

10:58.058 --> 10:59.693
I'm Emily.

11:00.027 --> 11:03.295
- Hey. Leslie.
- Nice to meet you.

11:03.297 --> 11:06.365
- Nice to meet you. Um, do you
need any help with any of this?

11:06.367 --> 11:08.300
- Oh, sure. Yeah. Um...
- Yeah.

11:08.302 --> 11:10.936
Do you want me to carry this?
- No, no, no. I got that.

11:10.938 --> 11:12.371
Um, you can take this.
- Sure.

11:12.373 --> 11:14.706
- And I'll give you
this too.

11:14.708 --> 11:16.041
Thank you.
- Yeah.

11:16.043 --> 11:19.378
- Um, so, how do you know Kim?

11:19.380 --> 11:22.149
- Oh, I work with her down
at the store.

11:22.617 --> 11:24.449
- Oh, wonderful. Yeah, she...

11:24.451 --> 11:26.919
she said she was looking
for someone to help her out.

11:26.921 --> 11:29.755
- Yeah.
- So, how long have you been
in town?

11:29.757 --> 11:32.791
- Um, about two weeks,
but I used to come through here

11:32.793 --> 11:34.126
all the time on my way
to Jackson Hole.

11:34.128 --> 11:35.861
So it's really familiar.

11:35.863 --> 11:36.795
- You married?

11:36.797 --> 11:39.798
No.
- What?

11:39.800 --> 11:42.901
- Um, well, any guy that wants
to marry me is fucking crazy.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.803
And I don't feel like
dating a crazy man.

11:44.805 --> 11:47.940
So, no.
- Well, do you like

11:47.942 --> 11:50.742
the burly type
or the lanky type?

11:50.744 --> 11:53.412
- Um...
- Hm?

11:53.414 --> 11:55.981
- I don't know, lanky?
- Oh!

11:55.983 --> 11:59.284
Well, I've got seven guys off
the top of my head

11:59.286 --> 12:01.119
who would kill for
a date with you.

12:01.121 --> 12:03.222
No. They're all friends
of my husband's.

12:03.224 --> 12:04.790
They're great guys.
- All right.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.158
Well, just let me see
pictures first,

12:06.160 --> 12:07.292
'cause I'm not about
the blind date.

12:07.294 --> 12:09.529
I'm sorry, of course.

12:09.531 --> 12:11.763
Remind me after the meeting.
- Okay.

12:11.765 --> 12:14.468
We are upstairs.

12:16.303 --> 12:17.972
Wow.

12:20.140 --> 12:21.940
- Leslie!
- Sorry.

12:23.944 --> 12:25.777
Um, so, how do you know Kim?

12:25.779 --> 12:28.180
- Oh, I taught her kiddos.

12:28.182 --> 12:31.450
- Oh, are you like a teacher?
- You bet.

12:31.452 --> 12:33.854
- Oh, so, you must be like
really smart.

12:34.255 --> 12:36.021
Yeah.

12:39.827 --> 12:41.561
Knock knock.

12:41.563 --> 12:43.295
- Oh, yay!

12:43.297 --> 12:44.863
- How are you?
- There they are.

12:44.865 --> 12:46.798
- Look at those pretty girls.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.267
- Here, let me take
this from you.

12:48.269 --> 12:49.835
- Got it.
- Thank you.

12:49.837 --> 12:52.237
- We have been snackin'
and waitin' for 25 minutes.

12:52.239 --> 12:53.972
- I'm sorry, there was a
straggler at school.

12:53.974 --> 12:55.374
You know how that goes.
- Mm-hmm.

12:55.376 --> 12:57.075
- Oh my God.
This bitch is hilarious.

12:57.077 --> 12:59.344
- Marjorie.
- And she brought pie.

12:59.346 --> 13:01.514
- I did!
- I've got an insane
sweet tooth.

13:01.516 --> 13:04.149
- You love to outdo yourself.
You're so good.

13:04.151 --> 13:07.152
- I thought this was, you know,
the perfect thing

13:07.154 --> 13:08.453
for our first meeting.

13:08.455 --> 13:11.857
You know, my way of saying
thank you for coming.

13:11.859 --> 13:15.093
- Oh, fuck. That looks amazing!
Leslie, we're in
a church.

13:15.095 --> 13:17.863
- Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.
It just, it looks so good.

13:17.865 --> 13:19.833
Wait, is this
for real?

13:23.003 --> 13:25.237
Why? Can no one take
a joke anymore?

13:25.239 --> 13:27.372
Why is everyone so serious
all the time?

13:27.374 --> 13:29.074
Okay.

13:29.076 --> 13:31.310
- Let's dig in.
-  This is not meant for decoration.

13:31.312 --> 13:33.912
- Let's eat it.
-  We should make this a tradition!

13:33.914 --> 13:36.817
Pie for the meetings.
- ...as soon as I can, I guess.

13:37.284 --> 13:39.484
Alice, thank you
so much for talking
to Father Marcus.

13:39.486 --> 13:42.087
This is perfect.
- Oh, so easy! Don't mention it.

13:42.089 --> 13:44.156
Everybody,
this is Leslie.

13:44.158 --> 13:46.491
She has been helping me
and Dylan out at the store.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.293
It's so nice
to meet you.

13:48.295 --> 13:50.095
- Nice to meet you.
-  Leslie, will you grab me

13:50.097 --> 13:51.363
like a little cupcake
or something?

13:51.365 --> 13:53.065
- Oh, yeah. Do you need help
sitting down?

13:53.067 --> 13:54.866
- I might.
- You look like you're
caring a little...

13:54.868 --> 13:56.168
- Well...
- ...a little extra.

13:56.170 --> 13:58.606
- I am. Thank you so much.

14:01.342 --> 14:03.609
- Look at this.
- Isn't that beautiful?

14:03.611 --> 14:08.880
- Oh, my goodness.
She worked all day and made pie?

14:08.882 --> 14:11.118
- Oh, my goodness.
- Thank you, Alice.

14:11.452 --> 14:13.420
Oh, my goodness.

14:15.289 --> 14:17.024
- Hm...

14:18.359 --> 14:20.192
- Ah!

14:20.194 --> 14:22.262
- So good.
- So good.

14:22.597 --> 14:23.995
- Butter.
- Mm-hmm.

14:23.997 --> 14:25.297
- Am I right?
- Yeah.

14:25.299 --> 14:27.065
- I mean how can something...

14:27.067 --> 14:30.135
so delicious be so bad for you?

14:37.044 --> 14:41.581
I am really, really happy
that we are finally doing this.

14:41.583 --> 14:42.515
Yes.

14:42.517 --> 14:45.352
- Um, today I just want us to...

14:46.019 --> 14:48.353
introduce ourselves, you know,
get to know each other.

14:48.355 --> 14:49.622
There's...

14:49.624 --> 14:53.460
There's no agenda
that needs to be accomplished.

14:56.564 --> 14:59.665
We are here to support
each other

14:59.667 --> 15:02.000
through this
multicultural warfare.

15:02.002 --> 15:03.168
- That's right.
- Mm-hmm.

15:03.170 --> 15:07.072
- Now, I... I have been
brainwashed

15:07.074 --> 15:10.275
to feel ashamed of my heritage.

15:10.277 --> 15:14.946
To feel...
guilt for the prosperity

15:14.948 --> 15:19.317
that our husbands, our fathers,
our brothers,

15:19.319 --> 15:21.521
created in the Western world

15:21.523 --> 15:25.223
and that everyone else
benefitted from.

15:25.225 --> 15:27.529
We're all brainwashed.
All of us.

15:27.862 --> 15:34.435
- Um... I'm a teacher down
at the school and...

15:35.068 --> 15:36.538
Um...

15:39.674 --> 15:41.208
I, um...

15:43.477 --> 15:45.245
I really want
to be a mom.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.481
And, um...

15:49.751 --> 15:52.184
getting pregnant is taking
a little bit longer

15:52.186 --> 15:54.321
than we expected, so...

15:58.726 --> 16:01.460
maybe God is giving me a
higher purpose, right?

16:01.462 --> 16:02.662
- That's right.
- Right.

16:02.664 --> 16:05.499
This club.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.535
Yeah.

16:07.802 --> 16:09.502
Well, I like the name.

16:09.504 --> 16:12.239
It has a sense of moving
through generations.

16:12.707 --> 16:14.707
- Yeah. Um...

16:14.709 --> 16:18.276
Well, do we want to go around
and introduce ourselves?

16:18.278 --> 16:21.146
Sort of, I don't know,
throw out ideas

16:21.148 --> 16:23.116
for what we might
want this to be.

16:23.518 --> 16:26.220
Um...

16:28.422 --> 16:30.422
- I...
- Caught you off guard.

16:30.424 --> 16:32.192
- I'm Marjorie, um...

16:32.660 --> 16:34.627
I'm actually not sure
I belong here.

16:34.629 --> 16:36.228
I'm sorry, I don't want
to make you mad.

16:36.230 --> 16:39.264
Just...
- No. You can never
make me mad, Marjorie.

16:39.266 --> 16:40.733
No, I mean that.

16:40.735 --> 16:43.335
No, this doesn't have
to be anything

16:43.337 --> 16:45.573
other than what you
want it to be.

16:45.974 --> 16:49.074
I mean, is there a
particular reason

16:49.076 --> 16:51.276
why you did come today?

16:51.278 --> 16:54.647
Oh, I just wanted advice
with a work thing.

16:54.649 --> 16:58.784
- Um? Well, do you want to
explain what happened

16:58.786 --> 17:00.555
and we can talk it out?

17:01.723 --> 17:04.524
- Um... yeah.

17:04.526 --> 17:08.161
Okay, so...
I work in town, um...

17:08.563 --> 17:12.063
Well, first off I want
to say I don't hate her.

17:12.065 --> 17:14.500
I don't hate anyone, um...

17:14.502 --> 17:15.768
But, yeah, I work in town

17:15.770 --> 17:19.539
and I take the bus
an hour each way

17:19.541 --> 17:23.509
and I have been busting
my ass for two years

17:23.511 --> 17:28.683
and... so that I could
get manager pay.

17:30.217 --> 17:32.352
And it's not her fault,
but um...

17:33.621 --> 17:35.153
but this Colombian girl,

17:35.155 --> 17:37.657
she started around
the same time as me.

17:37.659 --> 17:39.459
Me a little bit before her,
well...

17:40.060 --> 17:42.327
so she got promoted
and I didn't.

17:42.329 --> 17:44.830
- Of course.
- That's not fair.

17:44.832 --> 17:46.398
- That's how I felt.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.601
So did the Colombian
woman stick up for you

17:48.603 --> 17:50.570
and say, "Hey, she was hired
before I was?"

17:50.572 --> 17:52.237
Nope.

17:52.239 --> 17:53.808
No, so, I...

17:54.709 --> 17:56.107
Quick question.

17:56.109 --> 17:57.745
Nobody's gonna post
about this, right?

17:58.278 --> 18:02.447
- Oh, Marjorie. Our constitution
was designed to protect you.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.115
- Yeah.
- Right?

18:04.117 --> 18:05.620
You have feelings.

18:05.954 --> 18:07.687
Those feelings,
they're not wrong.

18:07.689 --> 18:09.289
- Right. Hmm...

18:09.691 --> 18:13.793
- Right. So, anyway, I decided
to stand up for myself--

18:13.795 --> 18:16.394
- Good.
- And I asked my manager

18:16.396 --> 18:18.764
why she got promoted
and I didn't.

18:18.766 --> 18:21.534
And he said it was because
she has better

18:21.536 --> 18:24.537
leadership skills than I do.

18:24.539 --> 18:27.272
Um... I don't know
what happened,

18:27.274 --> 18:30.910
but I just kinda snapped,
you know?

18:30.912 --> 18:32.814
- Mm-hmm.

18:34.849 --> 18:36.882
- It's 'cause she's brown.
- Thank you!

18:36.884 --> 18:38.751
- And nobody would stand up
for me.

18:38.753 --> 18:40.753
You know, my co-workers
didn't have my back

18:40.755 --> 18:43.321
and I... I just felt crazy.

18:43.323 --> 18:44.790
No. No, you're not
crazy.

18:44.792 --> 18:46.224
You're not crazy.
- Yeah.

18:46.226 --> 18:48.794
No, it's just like diversity.
Inclusion.

18:48.796 --> 18:50.495
It's like they're speaking
in fucking code.

18:50.497 --> 18:53.431
You know what I mean? It's on
every fucking form, you know.

18:53.433 --> 18:56.804
Every government form,
every employment form.

18:57.105 --> 18:59.874
Every fucking receipt.
You know what I mean? And...

19:00.307 --> 19:02.708
Yeah, so I just, I don't
know what to do and I...

19:02.710 --> 19:05.445
I guess that's why I'm here.

19:05.913 --> 19:07.280
- Hey.

19:07.582 --> 19:08.881
Thank you for sharing.

19:08.883 --> 19:11.151
And for speaking
up for yourself.

19:11.819 --> 19:14.555
I'd like to also add, you know,

19:14.956 --> 19:19.391
Mexicans and Blacks can get away
with saying things like,

19:19.393 --> 19:21.627
you know, "White people
are so awful."

19:21.629 --> 19:22.728
All the time.
- Yes!

19:22.730 --> 19:24.864
Or "White..."
This is my favourite.

19:24.866 --> 19:29.334
"White people are the worst."
And no one says anything.

19:29.336 --> 19:32.905
But the minute we offer up
any sort of critique...

19:32.907 --> 19:35.741
Ouh! People shout, "racist."

19:35.743 --> 19:37.242
Yep.

19:37.244 --> 19:40.278
Marjorie just know
you are in good company, okay?

19:40.280 --> 19:42.548
We all kind of feel
how you feel

19:42.550 --> 19:45.820
and anything you gotta say,
you're safe to get it out here.

19:47.487 --> 19:48.756
You know, it's like...

19:49.590 --> 19:52.223
the Asians come over,
they take over companies...

19:52.225 --> 19:54.629
get us sick, I don't say
anything, you know?

19:54.896 --> 19:56.461
And then...

19:56.463 --> 19:58.898
urban kids, right? They can't
even spell their name

19:58.900 --> 20:00.633
and they get into better
colleges than me.

20:00.635 --> 20:02.868
And it's like okay still, fine.
I don't say anything.

20:02.870 --> 20:06.438
- Mm-hmm.
- Now every brown bitch gets
special treatment

20:06.440 --> 20:08.674
because they've convinced people
to feel sorry for her

20:08.676 --> 20:10.343
and it's like...
I...

20:10.645 --> 20:12.410
then I'm the racist?

20:12.412 --> 20:15.514
It's like, there's nothing left
for me in this country.

20:15.516 --> 20:18.851
Yeah, I'm a good person.
I work hard.

20:18.853 --> 20:21.954
But I refuse to grow old
this poor

20:21.956 --> 20:24.690
and have people tell me
that I've got it good!

20:24.692 --> 20:26.792
I don't.
I'm struggling.

20:26.794 --> 20:28.830
I work paycheque to paycheque.

20:31.599 --> 20:33.500
Oh, boy.

21:00.762 --> 21:04.063
Oh, it is wonderful
to see young people in
the movement.

21:04.065 --> 21:05.631
I can't believe
you're not married.

21:05.633 --> 21:07.533
- Oh, well, don't worry
about that.

21:07.535 --> 21:09.668
We're gonna help with that.
Leslie is in the same boat.

21:09.670 --> 21:11.737
I know plenty of
great single men

21:11.739 --> 21:12.671
who'd just eat you up.

21:12.673 --> 21:14.372
Well, it's slim pickings
for me,

21:14.374 --> 21:16.809
but I got a couple if you
don't mind older.

21:16.811 --> 21:20.045
Actually, I only
date older men so...

21:20.047 --> 21:21.881
- Hey! Listen up.

21:21.883 --> 21:23.816
How about we all
come to the meeting

21:23.818 --> 21:26.519
with a list of, like,
10 great guys.

21:26.521 --> 21:29.056
Yes, great. Great.
- Yep. Alice.

21:30.091 --> 21:33.692
- Hi. I'm Alice up
on Owen Street.

21:33.694 --> 21:35.362
And, um...

21:36.931 --> 21:38.498
I'm tired.

21:39.901 --> 21:43.604
I spend a lot of my time alone.
In my own thoughts.

21:43.871 --> 21:46.541
We're really not supposed
to live like that.

21:47.340 --> 21:51.710
So... I hope that we
can keep growing

21:51.712 --> 21:53.815
and keep bringing
new people in

21:54.347 --> 21:57.516
because just being here with
you all,

21:57.518 --> 21:59.554
hearing your inspiring
ideas, Em...

21:59.921 --> 22:01.687
I already feel more like myself.

22:01.689 --> 22:03.122
Oh, me too, hon.

22:03.124 --> 22:06.525
It is so hard being
a mom. You can be so isolated.

22:06.527 --> 22:07.860
I mean, that's why
we need to recruit.

22:07.862 --> 22:09.728
Yeah, we gotta
keep growing.

22:09.730 --> 22:12.363
You don't have to be
going through this alone.

22:12.365 --> 22:14.600
Maybe talk to your friends.

22:14.602 --> 22:16.702
Start building a little
bit more community.

22:16.704 --> 22:18.436
Help them pick up groceries.

22:18.438 --> 22:22.074
Have them help you pick up
kiddos and...
- Yeah.

22:22.076 --> 22:25.878
- You know, you can really
introduce concepts anywhere.

22:25.880 --> 22:27.847
- And of course...
- At yoga class.

22:27.849 --> 22:28.848
Yeah!

22:28.850 --> 22:30.448
- Right. That's perfect.

22:30.450 --> 22:33.719
I mean, they're the ones
who started Black Lives Matter.

22:33.721 --> 22:36.088
They're the ones who are
creating this divide.

22:36.090 --> 22:38.793
They lit a fuse and then let
their kids run wild with it.

22:39.093 --> 22:41.392
Emily's life matters.
So does mine.

22:41.394 --> 22:43.662
All lives matter.

22:43.664 --> 22:44.732
Yes.

22:45.967 --> 22:47.666
- We have better doctors.

22:47.668 --> 22:49.068
We live longer.

22:49.070 --> 22:51.505
We take better care
of each other.

22:52.106 --> 22:53.541
These are facts.

22:53.908 --> 22:56.842
Does acknowledging facts
make me a bad person?

22:56.844 --> 22:59.678
No. Jeez, no.
- Oh, my goodness, no.

22:59.680 --> 23:00.915
Come here.

23:01.782 --> 23:03.115
Come here.

23:04.752 --> 23:06.585
- Thank you. Hi.
- I'm Jessica.

23:09.523 --> 23:13.458
Well, I wasn't sure
what to expect

23:13.460 --> 23:16.764
but Miss Emily was
real persistent.

23:17.064 --> 23:20.799
Um... okay, okay.

23:22.435 --> 23:25.436
My daddy was
the chapter President

23:25.438 --> 23:28.507
of the KKK in Valentine,
Nebraska,

23:28.509 --> 23:31.476
and I have been
a member my whole life.

23:31.478 --> 23:37.049
I'm more active in Stormfront
since our lives are online.

23:37.051 --> 23:40.485
And I don't normally
tell people that

23:40.487 --> 23:42.888
because I know what people
think about us

23:42.890 --> 23:45.524
and, you know, the media
loves to portray us

23:45.526 --> 23:47.893
as these like big scary
monsters.

23:47.895 --> 23:51.797
But am I really that scary?

23:51.799 --> 23:53.699
I'm a mother of four,

23:53.701 --> 23:57.202
pregnant with number five right
here, and...

23:57.204 --> 24:01.106
this club just really
appeals to me,

24:01.108 --> 24:04.209
because, well, it's like I
always say, it starts with

24:04.211 --> 24:06.946
the mommas and what they're
teaching their babies.

24:06.948 --> 24:08.881
God bless you.
Thank God.

24:08.883 --> 24:11.050
And I'm not here
to cause a fuss.

24:11.052 --> 24:13.018
I'm not here to say,
"Oh, you know, lynch 'em all,"

24:13.020 --> 24:14.653
you know, like people
might think.

24:14.655 --> 24:15.955
No, I'm just...

24:15.957 --> 24:18.659
I'm just here to talk
common sense.

24:18.993 --> 24:21.727
- Multiculturalism doesn't work.
- That's right.

24:21.729 --> 24:23.796
- It's never worked,
it's not going to work.

24:23.798 --> 24:26.000
They sure as hell
don't like us, and...

24:26.867 --> 24:29.168
- the feeling's mutual.
- Exactly.

24:29.170 --> 24:31.136
- So...
- I got two kids.

24:31.138 --> 24:32.204
- You're a momma too?

24:32.206 --> 24:33.605
- Yeah.
- Oh!

24:33.607 --> 24:35.074
Here, I'll pass
this to you then.

24:35.076 --> 24:38.844
I wanted to have more, but,
you know, they are expensive.

24:38.846 --> 24:40.579
So, you know, you try
to get loans,

24:40.581 --> 24:42.581
but, you try getting a loan
from the Jew banks.

24:42.583 --> 24:45.551
They love saying no.
They love it.

24:45.553 --> 24:47.853
I mean, I cannot laugh.

24:47.855 --> 24:48.954
- It's true, though.

24:48.956 --> 24:51.290
I mean, I don't know
when it happened,

24:51.292 --> 24:54.593
but we founded this country
in 1776, right?

24:54.595 --> 24:55.694
That's right.

24:55.696 --> 24:57.663
- And now we're watching
it being taken

24:57.665 --> 24:59.698
from under our noses
in plain sight.

24:59.700 --> 25:01.002
- Mm-hmm.

25:01.335 --> 25:04.269
- Dylan, you know,
he runs our store

25:04.271 --> 25:06.672
and we can barely stay afloat.
You see it.

25:06.674 --> 25:09.541
I mean, it's because
all the illegal immigrants,
they steal.

25:09.543 --> 25:11.178
- Yes, they do.

25:12.046 --> 25:14.213
And... oh, God!

25:14.215 --> 25:17.216
It's just the whining
and the disrespect you get

25:17.218 --> 25:18.851
from these coloured kids
who come into the store.

25:18.853 --> 25:20.886
They just come and barge in,

25:20.888 --> 25:22.721
and they're so freaking loud.

25:22.723 --> 25:25.657
They're... what is the point
of being so loud?

25:25.659 --> 25:28.027
And they're doing it
just to make sure

25:28.029 --> 25:29.730
you can't think straight.

25:32.199 --> 25:37.304
I think an ethnic state
is the most successful state.

25:37.605 --> 25:39.738
I think that's how
you ensure unity.

25:39.740 --> 25:42.207
I think that's how you
regulate the markets.

25:42.209 --> 25:43.277
- Mm-hmm.

25:43.544 --> 25:45.944
- I've got a journalism degree.

25:45.946 --> 25:48.047
- Hm?

25:48.049 --> 25:50.115
That's nice.
- And I was thinking about,

25:50.117 --> 25:52.117
you know, using it to help out
our group.

25:52.119 --> 25:54.019
And first thing you got to do,
obviously,

25:54.021 --> 25:56.255
is take the media
back from the Jews.

25:56.257 --> 25:58.891
- Mm-hmm.
- But Emily and I were thinking

25:58.893 --> 26:03.729
about starting a newsletter
or a magazine that contains
some of our ideas.

26:03.731 --> 26:05.230
And if we can get 'em
on the shelves,

26:05.232 --> 26:07.299
we can start reaching people.

26:07.301 --> 26:08.667
- Yeah.
- Right.

26:08.669 --> 26:11.303
- I didn't meet you.
I'm Kim, by the way.

26:11.305 --> 26:13.072
Hi, Kim.

26:13.074 --> 26:14.840
- Good to meet you.

26:14.842 --> 26:16.108
- Leslie.

26:16.110 --> 26:18.079
- Oh, me? Sorry.

26:18.979 --> 26:20.646
I'm Leslie.

26:20.648 --> 26:21.982
And...

26:24.952 --> 26:26.185
I'm sorry, what am I supposed
to say?

26:26.187 --> 26:27.252
Tell whatever you want.

26:27.254 --> 26:29.021
Whatever you want.
Why you're here.

26:29.023 --> 26:30.989
Yes, there are no wrong
answers, Leslie.

26:30.991 --> 26:32.660
I mean that. Okay?
- Okay.

26:33.494 --> 26:37.865
Well, I'm here because, well,
Kim invited me, honestly.

26:38.232 --> 26:39.667
And...

26:40.768 --> 26:42.369
you know, I've been
lucky that I've...

26:42.870 --> 26:45.304
I've been very lucky with
the friendships that I've made.

26:45.306 --> 26:47.608
I guess it's karma
for my shitty family.

26:48.642 --> 26:49.743
But, um...

26:50.311 --> 26:53.278
when I was in prison, I got
close with a group of people

26:53.280 --> 26:54.782
that really got
my head straight.

26:55.282 --> 26:57.952
And I really miss that way
of life, you know,

26:58.652 --> 27:01.353
being told what to do,
where to go,

27:01.355 --> 27:04.225
it just makes sense for me.

27:05.326 --> 27:06.393
So...

27:08.028 --> 27:09.828
a friend of mine knew that
I needed that out here,

27:09.830 --> 27:11.930
so she introduced me to Kim.
- Mm-hmm.

27:11.932 --> 27:14.768
- And that's what she is to me,
you know, my stability.

27:15.136 --> 27:19.271
And, I love her kids
like they were my own.

27:19.273 --> 27:22.141
They love her.
- I would kill for those babies.

27:22.143 --> 27:23.177
And...

27:24.078 --> 27:26.981
you know, I want to have
a family like that one day.

27:28.716 --> 27:30.117
Yeah, I mean, they just...

27:30.519 --> 27:31.952
They took me in.

27:32.554 --> 27:34.755
No questions asked, so...
- No, no.

27:36.257 --> 27:38.157
- I'm just here to help.
- Aw!

27:38.159 --> 27:39.793
- You know, in any way
that I can.

27:40.427 --> 27:42.761
Aw! Thank you
for sharing, Leslie.

27:42.763 --> 27:44.732
- Yeah.
- For being here.

27:45.766 --> 27:46.834
Um...

27:47.334 --> 27:50.035
I would also like to add this.

27:50.037 --> 27:53.340
- Really important.
- Yes. Yeah.

27:53.874 --> 28:00.247
- You know, these... these libs
say that they're fighting for
women's rights, right?

28:00.714 --> 28:03.182
They're just trying
to make us masculine.

28:05.219 --> 28:06.921
Well, think about it.

28:07.254 --> 28:11.091
Who would a guy rather be with?
Hm?

28:12.293 --> 28:14.695
Marjorie?

28:15.062 --> 28:16.762
Leslie?

28:16.764 --> 28:21.900
Or some, I don't...
blubbering brown whale

28:21.902 --> 28:24.803
coming in from God knows
what country,

28:24.805 --> 28:27.206
with what type of disgusting
disease.

28:27.208 --> 28:28.909
- Ew!

28:29.544 --> 28:35.382
- For our men's strength
and resources...

28:37.284 --> 28:41.088
they get this.

28:41.656 --> 28:44.358
- Ephesians 5.
- Yes. Yes.

28:44.858 --> 28:50.128
- Now this, this is the only
gender balance

28:50.130 --> 28:53.765
that has proven to build
strong families.

28:53.767 --> 28:55.336
- Yeah.

28:55.869 --> 28:59.171
And we need strong families.

28:59.173 --> 29:00.439
Aw, honey.

29:00.441 --> 29:04.776
You know, it goes
back to the 1960s

29:04.778 --> 29:06.914
with the, you know, the...

29:07.515 --> 29:10.518
the decay of the traditional
family which had this...

29:11.085 --> 29:13.187
- Hm.

29:14.288 --> 29:16.423
- It really messed us up.
- It did.

29:18.459 --> 29:21.493
You are such a resource.

29:21.495 --> 29:23.862
Beauty and brains.
Look at that.

29:23.864 --> 29:26.198
I just want to take
a minute here

29:26.200 --> 29:29.134
to acknowledge all the work
you did in organizing this

29:29.136 --> 29:31.470
and getting all of our butts
into one room.

29:31.472 --> 29:33.805
Making pie.

29:33.807 --> 29:36.441
Listen, you're really making
a difference, okay?

29:36.443 --> 29:38.010
For me anyway.
- Thank you, Kim.

29:38.012 --> 29:39.911
- Yeah.
-  And you make really great pie.

29:41.549 --> 29:42.848
I'm gonna take notes

29:42.850 --> 29:43.882
and I'll email everyone
afterwards.

29:43.884 --> 29:45.083
No. I don't...

29:45.085 --> 29:47.288
Maybe we shouldn't have
a trail like that.

29:47.555 --> 29:51.392
- I'm sorry. What have we done
that's wrong?

29:52.192 --> 29:54.527
No, name one thing
that we've said here

29:54.529 --> 29:56.828
or done here today
that's illegal. Tell me.

29:56.830 --> 29:58.363
- You're right. I'm sorry.
- No. Tell me.

29:58.365 --> 30:00.365
- Um, I--
- No. I'm sorry.

30:00.367 --> 30:02.403
I just, I'm more...
- Emily.

30:03.037 --> 30:05.404
Maybe we can talk about
the newsletter.

30:05.406 --> 30:09.609
Um, I would really appreciate,
I don't know about you guys,

30:09.611 --> 30:13.211
but I need home schooling
materials immediately.

30:13.213 --> 30:15.548
Because you should hear what
they are teaching my children.

30:15.550 --> 30:18.383
- Oh, I can only imagine.
I can only imagine.

30:18.385 --> 30:21.219
I will help you with curriculum.
It's...

30:21.221 --> 30:23.257
it's actually always been a...

30:23.957 --> 30:26.958
a dream of mine to write
a children's book.

30:26.960 --> 30:28.193
- Aw!
- Really?

30:29.631 --> 30:31.098
- You know you should, um...

30:32.266 --> 30:34.134
You should just make
your own school.

30:35.436 --> 30:38.604
You know, like, really,
really like dream big.

30:38.606 --> 30:40.138
- Yes!
- Put it all out there.

30:40.140 --> 30:44.644
- Yes! That is a great idea,
Leslie. Thank you.

30:44.646 --> 30:45.611
- Yeah.

30:45.613 --> 30:48.514
- Um, I...

30:48.516 --> 30:51.049
I've actually already
started on the book.

30:51.051 --> 30:52.417
What?
- Yeah.

30:52.419 --> 30:55.187
Just, you know, after school.
Sort of sketching, um...

30:55.189 --> 30:56.556
- Oh, my gosh.
- Let me see.

30:56.558 --> 30:58.290
- It's really rough, but...
- Oh my God.

30:58.292 --> 31:00.192
These are amazing, Emily.
- He's a cute dog.

31:00.194 --> 31:02.427
- Aw!

31:02.429 --> 31:04.329
- How did you learn how
to draw like this?

31:04.331 --> 31:05.533
- My brother.

31:06.433 --> 31:08.268
He's the real talent.

31:09.970 --> 31:11.336
- How creative you both are.

31:11.338 --> 31:12.337
All right.

31:12.339 --> 31:14.339
The magazine.
- Yes!

31:14.341 --> 31:17.175
- Should we, like, make a list

31:17.177 --> 31:19.344
of all the illegal immigrants
around the area?

31:19.346 --> 31:21.681
So everybody knows where
they live and stuff.

31:21.683 --> 31:24.182
- Um, no, no!
Hold on.

31:24.184 --> 31:29.121
That's the idea and, you know,
everything thus far

31:29.123 --> 31:30.956
has been a step in the right
direction in the magazine,

31:30.958 --> 31:34.025
but we want to be careful with
this first issue, right?

31:34.027 --> 31:37.028
We want to engage
the mainstream, right?

31:37.030 --> 31:39.534
We can't come on
too strong, okay?

31:40.535 --> 31:43.402
Soft on the outside

31:43.404 --> 31:48.206
so vigorous ideas
can be digested more easily.

31:48.208 --> 31:49.474
- Hm.

31:49.476 --> 31:53.613
- Now we are the best
secret weapon that no one

31:53.615 --> 31:59.017
checks at the door
because we tread quietly.

31:59.019 --> 32:00.354
- Hm.

32:00.655 --> 32:03.656
- I don't know where this fits
into everything,

32:03.658 --> 32:05.290
but I think it's important
to scold

32:05.292 --> 32:07.695
the spic and African parents
in front of their kids.

32:08.295 --> 32:10.495
That way the child will
see the parent

32:10.497 --> 32:12.364
as the root cause for
their embarrassment

32:12.366 --> 32:14.299
and naturally distance
themselves

32:14.301 --> 32:16.538
and their similarities as they
assimilate more quickly.

32:16.905 --> 32:19.337
I'm sorry.

32:19.339 --> 32:22.575
Wow, Alice--

32:22.577 --> 32:24.546
Oh my God.

32:24.846 --> 32:26.445
- Alice.
- It's on me.

32:26.447 --> 32:28.079
It's all down my back.
- I'm so sorry.

32:28.081 --> 32:29.181
Emily.

32:29.183 --> 32:30.616
- I'm so, I'm so sorry.

32:30.618 --> 32:32.585
- No, I'm sure it's my
fault in some way.

32:32.587 --> 32:34.286
- Jeez.
- I got it.

32:34.288 --> 32:35.688
- Oh, my gosh.

32:40.762 --> 32:42.963
- Father, thank you--
- Please go.

32:43.230 --> 32:45.130
- I'm sorry, we--
- Please.

32:45.132 --> 32:46.500
I don't want any trouble.

32:47.067 --> 32:52.170
- I don't understand, what--
- Please, just... I mean it.

32:52.172 --> 32:55.106
Just go right now
and I won't report you.

32:55.108 --> 32:56.611
But right now.

33:15.830 --> 33:18.096
- Good. I'm glad I didn't
ruin the sofa too.

33:18.098 --> 33:20.265
Ladies! Ladies.

33:20.267 --> 33:23.068
What?
- Should be we go back to my place for some wine?

33:23.070 --> 33:25.605
- Yeah!
I would love to,
but I can't. Kiddos.

33:25.607 --> 33:27.405
- Ow!
- Next time.

33:27.407 --> 33:29.675
- Next time.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
Lars and I have a date night.

33:29.677 --> 33:31.243
- Ow!
- We'll do it again.

33:31.245 --> 33:33.078
- I mean, I'm game.
- You sound like an ape

33:33.080 --> 33:34.446
when you speak like that.

33:34.448 --> 33:35.681
- Oh, God, yeah.

33:35.683 --> 33:36.782
I guess you're right.

33:36.784 --> 33:38.718
- Well, I'll help you work
on that.

33:38.720 --> 33:43.054
- I wish I could.
Really do, but duty calls.

33:43.056 --> 33:44.422
Do we need
to clean up?

33:44.424 --> 33:46.592
Oh, God!
No, leave it.

33:46.594 --> 33:48.426
- Are you sure? Okay.
- Yes!

33:48.428 --> 33:51.766
- They have staff. Um, Leslie,
my dear, are you gonna join us?

33:52.165 --> 33:53.431
- Yeah.
- Oh, great!

33:53.433 --> 33:54.301
- Yeah, sure.
- Great.

33:54.736 --> 33:57.503
We should get the guys
together sometime soon, yes?

33:57.505 --> 33:59.404
- Find me one first, would you?

33:59.406 --> 34:02.107
I have always loved
James for you.

34:02.109 --> 34:05.277
- Wait, wait, the guy that works
at the gasoline store?

34:05.279 --> 34:08.380
- Yes. Yeah, that's the redhead.
- God. Horrible hands.

34:08.382 --> 34:10.482
- Marjorie!
- Do you think I would like him?

34:10.484 --> 34:13.786
- Beggars can't be choosers.
- I mean, if you like short
and fat fingers.

34:13.788 --> 34:15.387
Yes, I think you'd really
like him.

34:15.389 --> 34:17.289
- Sometimes I do.

34:17.291 --> 34:19.291
- Okay. Well, then James
is your guy.

34:19.293 --> 34:20.693
- No, Leslie.
Don't listen to her.

34:20.695 --> 34:22.260
James would be great for you.

34:22.262 --> 34:23.696
- He's sweet.
- He deserves a good girl.

34:23.698 --> 34:25.263
- I get it, I get it.

34:25.265 --> 34:27.432
I just want to see
pictures first.

34:27.434 --> 34:29.702
- Yeah. It's always weird when
you show up

34:29.704 --> 34:33.506
and they're kind of like
fucking ew looking.

34:33.508 --> 34:35.808
Trust me.
- Yeah. Or then when they smile

34:35.810 --> 34:38.243
and you see their teeth.
- Oh my God.

34:38.245 --> 34:40.880
Oh my God!
I know exactly what you mean.

34:40.882 --> 34:42.582
I've walked out because
it's like, ugh!

34:42.584 --> 34:45.483
Here. Do you want some?
- Yeah. Thanks.

34:45.485 --> 34:48.521
- Always pack some extras.
- Oh!

34:48.523 --> 34:52.727
- Yeah?
- It really gets you
down to the bones.

34:54.394 --> 34:56.261
- Ah!
- Look at that moon.

34:56.263 --> 34:59.497
- That was the first time
I've been in a church in...

34:59.499 --> 35:01.132
I think since I was like seven.

35:01.134 --> 35:03.502
- Well, I'm surprised
I didn't burn up

35:03.504 --> 35:04.837
and go straight to hell. So...

35:04.839 --> 35:06.338
God.

35:06.340 --> 35:08.473
I feel the same way actually.

35:08.475 --> 35:12.143
Yeah.
- God has maybe forgiven us.

35:12.145 --> 35:13.813
- I don't know.

35:13.815 --> 35:16.414
I mean, he should after
going through that.

35:16.416 --> 35:19.317
- Thank you. Ladies, I'll email
you all with the notes later.

35:19.319 --> 35:21.252
So nice to meet you both.
- Jess, safe home.

35:21.254 --> 35:24.157
- Have a wonderful night,
ladies.

35:25.560 --> 35:27.660
- Jess!

35:27.662 --> 35:29.664
You're so bad.

35:32.432 --> 35:35.202
- Oh!

35:35.570 --> 35:40.238
- Um, thanks for inviting me.
It actually was kind of cool.

35:40.240 --> 35:42.374
- Well, it was either this
or kill myself.

35:42.376 --> 35:45.343
Kim, are you going to the store?
- Yeah, for a minute. Why?

35:45.345 --> 35:48.681
- We need some more wine.
- Yeah. Always more wine.

35:48.683 --> 35:50.415
- Can we get a ride
with you real quick?

35:50.417 --> 35:52.618
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Do you guys mind
a quick detour? I'm sorry.

35:52.620 --> 35:54.756
- Not at all!
- Shotgun!

35:55.089 --> 35:56.555
Damn it!

35:56.557 --> 35:58.593
- I was just going for it!

35:59.827 --> 36:00.926
Okay...

36:00.928 --> 36:02.494
- Hey!

36:02.496 --> 36:04.530
Oh, no. Yeah.

36:04.532 --> 36:05.931
No, it went great.

36:05.933 --> 36:08.901
Yes, yes, yes, but, Kimmy
is actually giving me a ride

36:08.903 --> 36:10.368
to the store to pick
up some things.

36:10.370 --> 36:11.737
So can you pick me up there?

36:11.739 --> 36:15.208
Great. Oh, um... Yeah.

36:15.710 --> 36:17.409
And actually some of the girls

36:17.411 --> 36:18.711
are gonna come over
for some wine.

36:18.713 --> 36:21.716
Is that okay?
Yeah, well, I don't know.

36:22.583 --> 36:23.885
Yeah. Yeah.

36:24.752 --> 36:27.285
Okay. All right.

36:27.287 --> 36:29.822
Yeah. I love you too, babe.

36:29.824 --> 36:31.356
Bye. See you soon.

36:31.358 --> 36:33.291
See you soon.
- Craig... Hey!

36:33.293 --> 36:36.796
Craig is excited to meet
my new friends.

36:36.798 --> 36:39.330
- Oh, he's a sweetheart.
- He is.

36:39.332 --> 36:43.334
- Thank you for coming
on into the mom van.

36:43.336 --> 36:45.838
Sorry it's so messy.
I didn't expect company.

36:45.840 --> 36:47.907
Also, sorry about the smell.

36:47.909 --> 36:51.711
It's pretty much our family's
locker room.

36:51.713 --> 36:53.979
So, that's why it smells
like feet, I guess.

36:53.981 --> 36:56.615
- I'm used to this smell.

36:56.617 --> 36:59.018
The backroom at the store
smells like it too.

36:59.020 --> 37:01.854
It's really Dylan. She says
it's the kids, it's not.

37:01.856 --> 37:04.489
Oh, no!

37:04.491 --> 37:07.026
Throw him under the bus.
- You're funny.

37:07.028 --> 37:08.596
- Thanks.

37:09.831 --> 37:11.564
So, how long have
you been teaching?

37:11.566 --> 37:14.600
- About five years now.
- Wow, that's a long time.

37:14.602 --> 37:16.569
- Yeah.
- What grades do you do?

37:16.571 --> 37:18.771
- I do kindergarten.
Yeah, really early.

37:18.773 --> 37:20.639
- That's so cute.
- I know!

37:20.641 --> 37:22.675
- They're so, so little.
- They're so little.

37:22.677 --> 37:25.878
They're so sweet! Ah!
I love it.

37:25.880 --> 37:27.280
- That's awesome.

37:27.749 --> 37:29.380
What age do you
teach? Sorry.

37:29.382 --> 37:32.051
- Kindergarten. Yeah,
so like five or six

37:32.053 --> 37:33.552
depending on, you know...
- Yeah, yeah.

37:33.554 --> 37:35.623
- ...their birth date. Yeah.

37:36.023 --> 37:37.525
- Hey, you know...

37:38.092 --> 37:39.992
I actually have all of
these vintage clothes

37:39.994 --> 37:43.629
that I've been wanting to sell
and make an online store.

37:43.631 --> 37:45.499
- Oh?
- And...

37:46.000 --> 37:48.634
I don't know, like,
I was thinking maybe

37:48.636 --> 37:50.972
we could put the money
for it towards...

37:51.639 --> 37:54.439
the school or the magazine,
or something like that.

37:54.441 --> 37:55.841
- Oh.
-  That's a really good idea.

37:55.843 --> 37:57.643
- You know, towards the cause.
- You would do that?

37:57.645 --> 37:59.477
- Yeah.
- I mean, I can contribute
stuff too.

37:59.479 --> 38:01.547
I've got a lot of stuff
lying around.

38:01.549 --> 38:03.414
That would be awesome.
- Yeah.

38:03.416 --> 38:06.353
- Yeah. And I mean, I still need
to take pictures to post them,
but...

38:06.821 --> 38:08.022
I mean, I don't know,
maybe...

38:08.756 --> 38:10.823
maybe you'd want to.
I mean, you're so pretty.

38:10.825 --> 38:12.457
You're basically like a model.
- What?

38:12.459 --> 38:14.627
What? No.
- Yes!

38:14.629 --> 38:16.361
- You're being silly!
- Emily, you have literally

38:16.363 --> 38:18.097
the best genes
of anybody I know.

38:18.099 --> 38:19.932
- Just fishing
for compliments!

38:19.934 --> 38:22.668
- Kim. No.
- You don't look like that.

38:22.670 --> 38:25.336
- I am not!
- You're like Barbie made real.

38:25.338 --> 38:27.540
Yeah!

38:27.542 --> 38:30.042
- I should just take you guys
around with me all the time.

38:30.044 --> 38:32.580
But seriously,

38:33.181 --> 38:34.947
we all have great genes, right?

38:34.949 --> 38:36.015
Yes, we do.

38:36.017 --> 38:37.550
- Marjorie, I...

38:37.552 --> 38:38.951
I don't mean to be staring
at your tits,

38:38.953 --> 38:40.719
- but you have great tits.
- It's true.

38:40.721 --> 38:44.023
- And I'm not a dyke.

38:44.025 --> 38:46.025
Small but mighty
I always say.

38:46.027 --> 38:48.794
- So will you do it?
Will you model the clothes?

38:48.796 --> 38:50.497
- Yeah. Yeah.

38:50.932 --> 38:52.900
Gosh, I just...

38:53.768 --> 38:56.003
Ah, I want my own school!

38:56.571 --> 38:58.971
You'd be perfect.
You really would.

38:58.973 --> 39:01.040
- I don't know, ladies.
-  If there's anybody who could do it...

39:01.042 --> 39:02.440
- And you know what?

39:02.442 --> 39:04.677
If niggers can have
their own colleges

39:04.679 --> 39:06.512
and Jews can have their
own community centres

39:06.514 --> 39:08.113
and Islam can have
its own laws,

39:08.115 --> 39:09.982
we can have our own goddamn
elementary school, yeah?

39:09.984 --> 39:11.819
- Yeah.
- Amen.

39:12.385 --> 39:16.655
Um, Leslie, do you have
a type of wine you prefer?

39:16.657 --> 39:19.525
- Um... I don't really.

39:19.527 --> 39:20.826
- Okay.

39:20.828 --> 39:24.096
- Red, white, rosé.
- Oh, rosé.

39:28.269 --> 39:30.102
I'll be in.

39:30.104 --> 39:31.706
- Okay.

39:32.773 --> 39:34.508
Did you do the...

39:34.976 --> 39:39.712
I called him, he's
coming on Tuesday at 3 o'clock.

39:39.714 --> 39:40.915
- Okay.

40:19.086 --> 40:20.786
- I'll ring you up.

40:20.788 --> 40:22.688
- Thank you, Kim.

40:22.690 --> 40:24.523
- Oh, hey!
- I can do it myself.

40:24.525 --> 40:26.025
- They're closed.
- Excuse me.

40:26.027 --> 40:28.629
- They're closed.
- We're closed.

40:29.063 --> 40:30.996
- Really? We're just gonna
be real quick.

40:30.998 --> 40:32.564
We're just getting
a bottle of wine.

40:32.566 --> 40:34.066
I don't care how quick
you're gonna be.

40:34.068 --> 40:35.868
We're closed.
- You're checking her out.

40:35.870 --> 40:37.636
- Yeah, but I work here.

40:37.638 --> 40:39.838
I'm sorry. Do you speak English

40:39.840 --> 40:41.173
or do we need to speak
slower for you?

40:41.175 --> 40:43.108
- What?

40:43.110 --> 40:45.476
Look, I had a long
day at work too.

40:45.478 --> 40:46.879
I understand.
Let's just...

40:46.881 --> 40:48.479
Can I just get a quick
bottle of wine?

40:48.481 --> 40:50.683
- I'll get the most expensive one.
- This is my store

40:50.685 --> 40:53.752
and I can refuse service
to anyone.

40:53.754 --> 40:55.688
I understand that...

40:55.690 --> 40:57.690
but legally you need
to have a better reason

40:57.692 --> 40:59.158
than being an old, tired cunt.

40:59.160 --> 41:00.926
- Lily, stop.
- Excuse me?

41:00.928 --> 41:04.563
What? Did...? What?
Are you fucking
serious?

41:04.565 --> 41:05.998
Let's go.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.167
You just walk into
our store saying that shit?

41:08.169 --> 41:09.601
- Come on.
- Let's go.

41:09.603 --> 41:10.936
You always just take it.
Stand up for yourself.

41:10.938 --> 41:12.673
- That's his sister.

41:15.710 --> 41:16.911
Let's go.

41:17.712 --> 41:18.980
- No.

41:20.247 --> 41:21.882
Buy your wine.

41:26.020 --> 41:29.623
You said you're going to buy...

41:30.157 --> 41:32.960
the most expensive
bottle of wine.

41:34.061 --> 41:36.595
I mean...

41:36.597 --> 41:38.897
isn't that what
she said to you, Kim?

41:38.899 --> 41:40.933
- Uh, yes.
- Yeah.

41:40.935 --> 41:42.503
That's what I heard.

41:44.271 --> 41:45.938
You don't need to get it.
Come on, let's go.

41:45.940 --> 41:47.208
It's all right.
I got it.

42:08.596 --> 42:10.229
- That's $300.

42:10.231 --> 42:12.664
Well, that's a really
good deal.

42:12.666 --> 42:15.202
- That's fucking ridiculous,
Anne. Come on, let's go.

42:30.284 --> 42:32.153
- Hold on.
Hold on, hold on.

42:37.091 --> 42:38.659
Okay.

42:39.593 --> 42:40.928
- We're good.

42:41.295 --> 42:43.030
Thanks.

42:46.233 --> 42:47.966
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

42:47.968 --> 42:51.136
The only people who carry
$300 in cash

42:51.138 --> 42:53.338
are either whores or thieves.

42:53.340 --> 42:55.142
- Or waitresses.

42:56.110 --> 42:58.145
- Sorry, wait a second.

43:00.114 --> 43:01.715
What even are you?

43:02.016 --> 43:04.983
- Yeah. Kinda looks like
a chink fucked a wetback.

43:13.027 --> 43:15.229
Whatever you think I am
is how you're gonna treat me.

43:15.629 --> 43:17.631
So I guess that's what I am.

43:18.299 --> 43:20.101
- Just let us go.
- Hey!

43:21.869 --> 43:24.036
Say thank you, faggots.

43:24.038 --> 43:26.772
- We're sisters.
You fucking idiot.

43:26.774 --> 43:28.807
- What the fuck did
you just call me?

43:28.809 --> 43:31.777
- Don't fucking touch her!
- Get off of me.

43:31.779 --> 43:33.645
Get off of me!

43:33.647 --> 43:35.714
- Get off!
- Get off of me!

43:38.052 --> 43:39.985
- Let go of her fucking purse,
you fucking animal.

43:39.987 --> 43:42.421
Get the fuck out.
- Get the fuck out!

43:42.423 --> 43:44.258
- Come, let's go.
- Get out!

43:45.126 --> 43:46.861
- The fuck!

43:47.261 --> 43:48.360
- Fuck you!
- Emily Reif,

43:48.362 --> 43:50.095
you know what they
do to rapists

43:50.097 --> 43:51.430
like your brother in prison?

43:51.432 --> 43:53.398
He's never gonna be able
to take a solid shit again.

43:53.400 --> 43:54.900
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

43:54.902 --> 43:56.768
- Holy fucking shit!
Are you fucking kidding me?

43:56.770 --> 43:58.871
No. She's a fucking slut!

43:58.873 --> 44:00.739
She's a fucking liar.

44:00.741 --> 44:02.341
Hey. Hey! Hey!
- She's a liar.

44:02.343 --> 44:03.876
What's going on, Kim?

44:03.878 --> 44:05.711
Disrespectful.

44:05.713 --> 44:07.446
That was so fucking
disrespectful.
- You're okay?

44:07.448 --> 44:09.448
The fuck!
- What's going on?

44:09.450 --> 44:11.250
Your brother would
never touch that girl.

44:11.252 --> 44:12.818
- What's going on?
- Much less rape her.

44:12.820 --> 44:14.686
- What's going on?
- She was threatening me.

44:14.688 --> 44:17.823
- Who was threatening you?
-  The bitch who put Jeff in jail.

44:17.825 --> 44:19.391
She was just in here.
She just walked in here.

44:19.393 --> 44:20.726
I didn't know what she wanted.

44:20.728 --> 44:21.960
She walked in here
with somebody else.

44:21.962 --> 44:23.462
And I didn't recognize
her at first. But...

44:23.464 --> 44:25.030
- I got it. I got it.

44:25.032 --> 44:26.765
Hey, we had a long week, okay?

44:26.767 --> 44:28.033
Let's go get some
wine and go home.

44:28.035 --> 44:29.334
- Wait...
- Okay?

44:29.336 --> 44:31.970
- Craig, Craig, you should
freaking see all of 'em.

44:31.972 --> 44:34.039
They hang outside of Clark's
and they just...

44:34.041 --> 44:35.440
they are so loud
and like animals.

44:35.442 --> 44:37.209
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Drinking all this...

44:37.211 --> 44:39.144
- So you know these guys?
- No, I don't know 'em.

44:39.146 --> 44:40.812
But she went to school
with Anne.

44:40.814 --> 44:42.781
I... I didn't know
the other one.

44:42.783 --> 44:44.082
- Hold on, hold on!

44:44.084 --> 44:45.784
- It's okay.
It's okay.

44:45.786 --> 44:49.087
- That bitch needs to shut her
carpet munching fucking face.

44:49.089 --> 44:51.089
Okay? You know where she lives?

44:51.091 --> 44:53.058
- I... yeah.
- Yeah? Yeah?

44:53.060 --> 44:54.726
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

44:54.728 --> 44:56.128
Let's go. Come on.

44:56.130 --> 44:57.930
All we'll do is take
a shit in her tub

44:57.932 --> 44:59.898
or like, steal her fucking
passport or something.

44:59.900 --> 45:01.500
- Hey. Hey.
- She'll never know
that it's us.

45:01.502 --> 45:03.202
- Come on, now.
- No.

45:03.204 --> 45:04.937
She cannot talk
to her like that.

45:04.939 --> 45:06.738
- She can't use that disrespect.
- Sweetheart, let's go home.

45:06.740 --> 45:08.340
- We shouldn't.
- No. We should.

45:08.342 --> 45:09.877
- What do you mean,
you shouldn't?

45:12.846 --> 45:13.648
- I can go alone,
if everyone wants, okay?

45:15.149 --> 45:16.348
I can just do it myself.

45:16.350 --> 45:17.883
But she cannot be talking
to you like that.

45:17.885 --> 45:19.418
- No. You know what,
I'm fucking game.

45:19.420 --> 45:20.953
I'm sorry, I'm in.

45:22.156 --> 45:24.122
I'm in.
- Emily.

45:24.124 --> 45:26.325
- It'll be fun.
- Teach the bitch a lesson.

45:26.327 --> 45:28.493
- I'll do it if you do it.
- Yeah. Fuck that shit.

45:28.495 --> 45:30.929
- Just for a minute.
- Okay. Yes, yes, yes.

45:30.931 --> 45:32.164
I'll go.
- Yes!

45:32.166 --> 45:33.966
- I'll go. I'll go. I'll go.
- What are you...

45:33.968 --> 45:36.068
- This is just like high school!
- Let's go get supplies.

45:36.070 --> 45:38.203
- Oh, man, we're riding again.

45:40.808 --> 45:42.176
- What?

45:43.210 --> 45:44.979
What?

45:45.479 --> 45:47.181
- I didn't say anything.

45:47.515 --> 45:49.281
- Then what's with
this mopey thing?

45:49.283 --> 45:50.751
Huh?

45:51.318 --> 45:53.385
- Do you know what you're
talking about here, sweetheart?

45:53.387 --> 45:55.887
- It's a practical joke.

45:55.889 --> 45:58.192
- No.
It's a fucking felony, honey.

45:59.393 --> 46:00.894
Look at me.

46:01.596 --> 46:04.830
We had a rough call
from the doctor this week...

46:04.832 --> 46:06.566
and I think maybe
we're not thinking straight.

46:06.568 --> 46:09.970
But that's why we'll go home...
- This has nothing to do
with that.

46:10.572 --> 46:12.940
You're so fucking stupid.

46:14.441 --> 46:16.542
You want to be
a little fairy here?

46:16.544 --> 46:18.812
No, that's fine, okay?

46:19.480 --> 46:21.313
You want your wife...

46:21.315 --> 46:23.849
to look at you every day

46:23.851 --> 46:25.786
like a pussy bitch?

46:26.086 --> 46:27.853
No, I can live like that.

46:27.855 --> 46:29.522
Yeah.

46:29.524 --> 46:31.557
But I'm not sure that you can.
- Okay.

46:31.559 --> 46:35.027
Okay.
- You need to be a big man
here...

46:35.029 --> 46:37.931
and teach people how
to respect you.

46:38.165 --> 46:41.601
Nobody talks to your wife
the way that she did,

46:41.603 --> 46:43.969
because that is
disrespecting you.

46:43.971 --> 46:45.470
Do you understand me?

46:45.472 --> 46:47.005
- Yeah.

46:47.007 --> 46:48.842
- Hey.
Hey, look at me.

46:50.244 --> 46:54.882
Do you want
me to look at you like
a fucking faggot, babe?

47:00.354 --> 47:02.555
- No.
- No. No, you don't.

47:02.557 --> 47:04.058
Okay.

47:04.526 --> 47:07.059
Yeah.

47:07.061 --> 47:10.262
You guys are gonna make
the tallest, prettiest babies.

47:10.264 --> 47:12.600
- Oh, Kim.
- You are.

47:13.467 --> 47:15.601
Are we ready?
We're gonna do it.

47:15.603 --> 47:17.336
- I'm ready.
- Leave your phones.

47:17.338 --> 47:19.237
- Hey. Hey!
- What?

47:19.239 --> 47:21.475
- Leave your phones here.
- Why?

47:21.942 --> 47:24.144
- So they can't trace
that you've been there.

47:24.878 --> 47:27.112
That's really smart.

47:27.114 --> 47:29.649
Okay. Okay, Craig.
That's actually
really, really smart.

47:29.651 --> 47:31.383
- Copy that.
- Yeah.

47:31.385 --> 47:32.984
Cheer up, softy.

47:32.986 --> 47:34.622
- Let's fucking do this.

47:34.855 --> 47:36.390
Fuck.

47:40.327 --> 47:42.062
- I love you.

47:42.429 --> 47:44.396
- Oh, God.
- My lady.

47:44.398 --> 47:46.998
- Why, thank you, my dear.
- Your chariot awaits.

47:47.000 --> 47:48.400
Here I come.

47:56.544 --> 47:57.677
Ahem.

47:57.679 --> 47:59.211
Hell yeah.

48:00.648 --> 48:02.447
- Ladies.
- Yeah.

48:02.449 --> 48:04.149
Oh my God, I can't
believe we're doing this!

48:04.151 --> 48:05.685
- No. Kim.
- What?

48:05.687 --> 48:07.653
- This stays here, right?
- Yeah, obviously.

48:07.655 --> 48:10.055
- Of course it does.
- Yeah. Of course, Em.

48:10.057 --> 48:11.323
- I can't believe
we're doing this.

48:11.325 --> 48:12.558
- I love you guys.

48:12.560 --> 48:15.026
- Let's turn that music on.

48:15.028 --> 48:18.598
- Oh my God.
I fucking love this song.

48:18.600 --> 48:20.165
Yeah!

48:20.167 --> 48:21.569
- It's so fucking good.

48:29.376 --> 48:32.210
- Hey. Hey. Shh! Shut up.

48:32.212 --> 48:34.012
Kim, can you turn
the music off, please?

48:34.014 --> 48:35.447
- Fucking Jesus.

48:35.449 --> 48:36.982
- Turn it off, please.

48:36.984 --> 48:38.083
- Fuck.

48:38.085 --> 48:39.184
- Sorry.
- Craig...

48:39.186 --> 48:40.588
- Buzzkill.

48:43.691 --> 48:45.223
- You know, it's not a big deal.

48:45.225 --> 48:46.559
Okay, it's a little
bit of a big deal

48:46.561 --> 48:48.694
that Alice spilled
all over me...

48:48.696 --> 48:52.230
and ruined my favourite
sweater, but...

48:52.232 --> 48:54.132
- I think it'll come out.
- Yeah.

48:54.134 --> 48:56.067
I just feel like she's
kind of clumsy.

48:56.069 --> 48:58.103
Is she the person
that we want to have
taking our notes?

48:58.105 --> 49:01.373
- Yeah.
She is physically clumsy,
but she is organized.

49:01.375 --> 49:03.074
- Hey, hey, hey. Slow down.
- What?

49:03.076 --> 49:05.277
- It's right here. Slow down.
- Sorry. Where? Left, right?

49:05.279 --> 49:07.314
What?
- Right. Right. Turn right.

49:07.682 --> 49:09.582
Yeah.
Turn it slow. It's steep.

49:09.584 --> 49:11.416
Oh, dear, that is steep.

49:11.418 --> 49:13.353
Holy fuck.

49:15.690 --> 49:17.757
Kim, we can talk about
Alice later, okay?

49:17.759 --> 49:19.991
- All right.
- Wait a second. Wait a second.

49:19.993 --> 49:21.493
This bitch lives on the hill?

49:21.495 --> 49:22.728
- Yeah.
She lives on the hill.

49:22.730 --> 49:24.664
What?
- I'm in a fucking duplex.

49:24.666 --> 49:26.398
And she lives on
the fucking hill.

49:26.400 --> 49:28.734
- Yeah. Yeah.
All of this is hers.

49:28.736 --> 49:31.069
- Jesus.
- I bet she can see the
lake from up here.

49:31.071 --> 49:32.404
- She can.
- How do you know that?

49:32.406 --> 49:33.773
We just passed
by a sign that said:

49:33.775 --> 49:35.307
"Leave all your troubles
behind."

49:35.309 --> 49:37.409
- I check up on her.
You know, I keep tabs on her.

49:37.411 --> 49:39.377
I'm in trouble.

49:39.379 --> 49:41.248
- You gotta let that go, baby.

49:41.583 --> 49:43.685
Fuck that shit.

49:47.722 --> 49:50.222
- Is this the only entrance
to the property?

49:50.224 --> 49:52.190
- Well, to the street.
Yeah.

49:52.192 --> 49:54.025
- That's fucking risky,
don't you think?

49:54.027 --> 49:55.595
If somebody comes home,
we're stuck here.

49:55.597 --> 49:57.797
- Well, then, okay.
Well, then, someone needs
to stand watch.

49:57.799 --> 50:00.566
It's simple.
This is it. This is it.
- Kim, hold on.

50:00.568 --> 50:02.502
Fucking shit.
- That's it?
- Yeah.

50:02.504 --> 50:06.039
That shed is fucking
bigger than my fucking
apartment.

50:06.273 --> 50:07.773
- Are there pets in there?

50:07.775 --> 50:10.010
- I don't think so.
No.

50:10.310 --> 50:12.045
No. I don't know.

50:12.246 --> 50:13.713
- She lives by herself?

50:13.715 --> 50:15.581
Yeah, I don't know.

50:15.583 --> 50:17.683
Yes, she lives by her...
- It really matters that
you know that.

50:17.685 --> 50:19.217
- Yeah. Okay.
She lives by herself.

50:19.219 --> 50:21.086
She inherited this place
when her mom died.

50:21.088 --> 50:23.121
So, yes.
She lives here alone, Craig.

50:24.424 --> 50:26.291
Prosecutor
over here, Jesus.

50:26.293 --> 50:27.793
- Just an inquisition here.

50:27.795 --> 50:29.695
- Fuck. All right.

50:29.697 --> 50:32.197
It's as good a time
as any, I guess.

50:32.199 --> 50:34.399
Five minutes and not a second
longer than that.

50:34.401 --> 50:36.103
Hold on.

50:36.470 --> 50:38.069
I'm gonna wait outside.
I don't want to know

50:38.071 --> 50:39.471
what the fuck you guys
were doing in there.

50:39.473 --> 50:40.806
When I come get you,
we're leaving. Okay?

50:40.808 --> 50:43.141
- Yeah.
- Okay?

50:43.143 --> 50:46.779
- Yes.
Yes, this is my sexy man!

50:46.781 --> 50:48.480
Oh my God.
There's the fucking lake.

50:48.482 --> 50:50.550
- He's gonna stand watch for us.
- That is fucked up.

50:50.552 --> 50:52.284
I'm sorry,
but I have a question.

50:52.286 --> 50:54.252
Just pull it up here
and kill the engine.

50:54.254 --> 50:56.254
- If she isn't even home,

50:56.256 --> 50:58.258
why do we only have
to be five minutes?

50:59.861 --> 51:01.694
- Is she a good idea?

51:01.696 --> 51:03.228
Honestly.
- Craig, she is fine.
She's fine.

51:03.230 --> 51:04.630
Craig, she works hard.
She's totally solid.

51:04.632 --> 51:06.131
Craig, you need
to fucking loosen up, man.

51:06.133 --> 51:07.432
- Yeah, Craig.
I'm solid.

51:07.434 --> 51:09.802
- Five minutes and not
a second longer than that.

51:09.804 --> 51:11.469
What do you think of that?

51:11.471 --> 51:14.074
I'll bring the wine.

51:14.542 --> 51:16.341
- Jesus, man.
- Babe!

51:16.343 --> 51:18.243
- We're just fucking having
a good time, man.

51:18.245 --> 51:19.781
- Babe, use your upper
body strength.

51:28.355 --> 51:30.424
- Kim, you're in the back.
- What? Okay.

51:33.628 --> 51:35.295
- Fuck.

51:46.473 --> 51:49.109
She has a kayak!
- Shut the fuck up.

51:50.277 --> 51:51.711
Why do we need
to be so quiet?

51:51.713 --> 51:53.445
She's not even home.
- Just shut the fuck up.

51:53.447 --> 51:55.715
I know, right?
So dumb.
- Hold on. Hold on.

51:55.717 --> 51:58.283
- What? What?

51:58.285 --> 52:00.686
- I fucking hate this.
I have a really bad feeling.

52:00.688 --> 52:03.522
There's too much space
between the house and the road.

52:03.524 --> 52:05.423
We're not gonna get
everybody out unseen.

52:05.425 --> 52:06.828
Emily...

52:20.775 --> 52:22.440
Does she have a dog?

52:22.442 --> 52:24.177
- I don't know.

52:24.646 --> 52:27.379
- Shut up. Shut up.
- It's a puppy.

52:27.381 --> 52:29.515
What?
You can't take a dog, Craig?

52:29.517 --> 52:31.316
- Shh, shh, hey, buddy.

52:31.318 --> 52:32.918
- He's so cute.

52:32.920 --> 52:34.654
Wait, should I grab
a rock?

52:34.656 --> 52:36.254
And we can fucking throw
it through the window.

52:36.256 --> 52:37.422
No.

52:37.424 --> 52:38.691
You should look for
a hide-a-key.

52:38.693 --> 52:40.593
A hide-a-key?
What the fuck is that?

52:40.595 --> 52:43.361
Seriously?

52:43.363 --> 52:45.665
- Leslie! Shh...
- I found it.

52:45.667 --> 52:47.633
- It was really right
the fuck there?

52:47.635 --> 52:49.367
- Really right the fuck there.

52:49.369 --> 52:51.269
I'm surprised this bitch
hasn't been burgled before.

52:51.271 --> 52:53.238
Shut the fuck up.

52:53.240 --> 52:54.876
- What?

52:55.677 --> 52:57.910
He's excited to see us.
- Get the dog.

52:57.912 --> 53:00.515
- Hello. Hello.
Come here.

53:01.649 --> 53:03.883
Oh.
It's a big house.

53:03.885 --> 53:06.384
Oh my God.
- Baby.

53:06.386 --> 53:08.386
- Oh my God.
- Oh, wow.

53:08.388 --> 53:10.255
Look at these floors.
That's beautiful.

53:10.257 --> 53:12.290
- Hey. Hey.

53:12.292 --> 53:13.859
Four minutes

53:13.861 --> 53:15.561
and I'm gonna wait outside.

53:15.563 --> 53:17.897
- Cool.
- Kim, I'm not fucking around.
Okay?

53:17.899 --> 53:19.598
- I know.
- Man, you have lost a lot

53:19.600 --> 53:21.602
of your sense of humour
these days.

53:22.235 --> 53:24.837
- Oh my God.
She has a washer and a dryer.

53:24.839 --> 53:27.272
- Nice.
- Front loaders.

53:27.274 --> 53:28.808
- I wonder if it's one
of those smart ones

53:28.810 --> 53:30.509
where you can control
it on your phone.

53:30.511 --> 53:32.878
- What I would give...
never to go

53:32.880 --> 53:35.014
to the laundromat again.

53:35.016 --> 53:36.949
- That's shitty art.

53:36.951 --> 53:38.617
Aw, sweet baby.
- This is very shitty art.

53:38.619 --> 53:40.553
- It's shitty art.
- Let's see if we have
anything to...

53:40.555 --> 53:41.987
- Yes!

53:41.989 --> 53:43.689
Save one of those beers for me.
Will you?

53:43.691 --> 53:46.959
- Maybe. We'll see.
- Sweet baby.
Look at this baby boy.

53:46.961 --> 53:49.528
Look at this sweet baby boy.
- He's cute.

53:49.530 --> 53:51.697
He's so scared.
Where is your mommy?

53:51.699 --> 53:53.398
She left you alone.

53:53.400 --> 53:55.034
- Why did she leave you alone?
- Wait, what are we...

53:55.036 --> 53:57.670
- Jesus Christ!
- Fuck, Marjorie.

53:57.672 --> 53:59.739
Fuck me.
- Let me in.

53:59.741 --> 54:02.777
Get in here.

54:03.310 --> 54:06.311
- I'm sorry,
am I being too loud?

54:06.313 --> 54:08.681
Craig. Craig!

54:08.683 --> 54:10.883
Fuck!

54:10.885 --> 54:12.820
Are you fucking kidding me?

54:13.286 --> 54:15.386
How do you turn...

54:15.388 --> 54:16.722
Fuck.

54:16.724 --> 54:18.389
Are you fucking kidding me?

54:18.391 --> 54:19.925
I always wanted
a fucking piano...

54:19.927 --> 54:22.630
but we could never afford one.

54:24.065 --> 54:25.531
Oh, fuck!

54:27.769 --> 54:32.472
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It just... fell.

54:32.673 --> 54:34.607
I'm sorry.
- What did you do?

54:34.609 --> 54:36.976
- I just dropped the glass.
- Just clean it up, okay?

54:36.978 --> 54:38.577
- Okay.
I'm cleaning it up.

54:38.579 --> 54:39.945
No, this piano is a...
- Kim.

54:39.947 --> 54:42.715
- Yeah? Yes, Emily.
- Help me find the passport.

54:42.717 --> 54:44.852
- I'm gonna check upstairs.

54:48.923 --> 54:51.557
Can you hide in here?
Yeah.

54:51.559 --> 54:53.793
I always wanted
to play piano, but...

54:53.795 --> 54:55.663
It's freezing up here.

54:56.798 --> 54:59.330
- Kim!
- Yeah!

54:59.332 --> 55:01.033
- Are you upstairs?
- Yeah.

55:01.035 --> 55:03.803
- Did you find anything?
- Not yet.

55:03.805 --> 55:06.572
It's dark.
And, ooh, cold.

55:06.574 --> 55:08.908
- It's very...
Did you check under the bed?

55:08.910 --> 55:11.076
Yeah. I just did.
But I didn't see anything there.

55:11.078 --> 55:12.812
- You checked the... Ouch!

55:12.814 --> 55:14.713
- See? See?

55:14.715 --> 55:17.448
- What is with this ceiling?
- Us, tall, blonde models

55:17.450 --> 55:19.084
gotta worry about that,
don't we?

55:19.086 --> 55:21.789
- Kim. Did you check in here?
- No. I mean, no, not there.

55:22.990 --> 55:25.423
- Oh, God.
- Found her underwear drawer.

55:25.425 --> 55:28.661
- Eww! I bet they smell.

55:28.663 --> 55:29.995
- Let's see.
Let's see.

55:29.997 --> 55:31.530
- It's like...

55:31.532 --> 55:33.699
What?
- I found it! I found it!
- You found it?

55:33.701 --> 55:36.035
- I found it.
- Wait!
- Oh my God! You found it.

55:36.037 --> 55:38.103
- You found it?
- What are we doing with this?

55:38.105 --> 55:40.005
Yes.
- We found it!

55:40.007 --> 55:41.674
We found the passport.

55:41.676 --> 55:43.909
'Cause we know
this bitch is not American!

55:43.911 --> 55:46.645
Oh, we found the passport!

55:46.647 --> 55:48.514
- I'm just playing
the fucking piano.

55:48.516 --> 55:49.782
Jesus Christ.
- Who has a lighter?

55:49.784 --> 55:52.618
- No, no, no. Let me do it.
- Oh my God, are we burning it?

55:52.620 --> 55:54.587
- Hey!
- Let me do it.
- Kim.

55:54.589 --> 55:57.823
- I saw matches.
- That was not five
minutes, Craig.

55:57.825 --> 55:59.792
- It absolutely was.
Please, can we go?

55:59.794 --> 56:01.527
- It wasn't five.
- We shouldn't burn it here

56:01.529 --> 56:03.128
because there's
like smoke alarms.

56:03.130 --> 56:04.897
Leslie!

56:04.899 --> 56:06.464
- Sorry. I'm not gonna
burn the house down.

56:06.466 --> 56:08.067
- Emily! Let's go!
We'll burn it...
- Oh, my gosh.

56:08.069 --> 56:09.802
- Let's burn it in your
fire pit at home.

56:09.804 --> 56:11.537
- Shh!
- But we should check--

56:11.539 --> 56:12.940
- Shh!

56:13.841 --> 56:15.009
- What?

56:15.442 --> 56:16.742
- Hide.
- What?

56:16.744 --> 56:18.143
- Hide right now!
- Oh my God.

56:18.145 --> 56:20.512
- Hide and get out when you can.
- Oh my God. This way.

56:20.514 --> 56:22.081
- Fuck!
- Shit.
- Fuck!

56:22.083 --> 56:23.751
- Oh, shit.

56:24.185 --> 56:26.118
- Move, move, move.
- Shit.

56:26.120 --> 56:29.657
- Fuck!
I fucking told you.

56:33.761 --> 56:35.462
Is that better?

56:35.830 --> 56:37.497
Fuck!

56:38.633 --> 56:40.067
- Fuck!

56:48.042 --> 56:49.644
- Willie?

56:50.611 --> 56:52.580
Willie?

56:56.150 --> 56:57.818
She's leaving.

56:58.719 --> 57:01.053
- Stop her. Get her.
Get her.

57:02.757 --> 57:04.657
- Get her.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.

57:04.659 --> 57:05.691
- Shit.

57:05.693 --> 57:07.192
- Oh my God.

57:07.194 --> 57:08.994
It's okay.
Just don't move.

57:08.996 --> 57:10.763
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

57:10.765 --> 57:12.564
- Grab a chair.
- Here.

57:12.566 --> 57:14.600
- Put her right there.
- I got it.

57:14.602 --> 57:16.502
I got it.

57:16.504 --> 57:18.570
- Give me your hands.
- Shut the fuck up.
It's okay.

57:18.572 --> 57:21.040
- Give me your hands.
- I'm sorry. It's okay.

57:21.042 --> 57:23.509
It's just a practical joke,
okay? It's just a joke.

57:23.511 --> 57:25.177
I'm sorry.
We're leaving. Okay?

57:25.179 --> 57:27.813
- Emily. What the fuck?
- We're leaving.
What are you fucking doing?

57:27.815 --> 57:30.115
What do you think I'm fucking doing?
I'm fucking holding her down.

57:30.117 --> 57:32.051
- Kim, let's go.
Let's go.

57:32.053 --> 57:33.852
- Sorry. Let's go.
- Let's fucking go.

57:33.854 --> 57:35.220
Kim, what the fuck
are you doing?

57:36.891 --> 57:40.626
- Shut up or I will
fucking kill you!

57:40.628 --> 57:42.261
Do you fucking hear me?

57:42.263 --> 57:44.797
This is all because you
fucking sassed us back there.

57:44.799 --> 57:46.265
Do you fucking understand this?

57:46.267 --> 57:48.133
- This is not funny
anymore at all.

57:48.135 --> 57:49.668
This is big trouble.
- Okay. It's okay.

57:49.670 --> 57:51.603
- What are we doing?
- Okay, I love my fucking job.

57:51.605 --> 57:52.771
- Em?
- And Terry needs me.

57:52.773 --> 57:54.139
I don't want to go
to fucking jail.

57:54.141 --> 57:56.508
- It's okay. Just stop it.
Just stop it, Craig.

57:56.510 --> 57:59.044
Stop whining and whimpering
like a fucking cunt!

57:59.046 --> 58:01.146
I'm sick of it!
- Emily!
- We were just joking around.

58:01.148 --> 58:03.082
- What are we doing?
- What the fuck are you doing?

58:03.084 --> 58:04.683
- What do you mean,
what am I doing?

58:04.685 --> 58:06.919
I don't know what I'm doing.
I'm trying to help.

58:06.921 --> 58:08.153
- Kim!

58:09.890 --> 58:11.857
Let's go.

58:11.859 --> 58:14.193
- Where is he going?
- He's fucking scared.

58:14.195 --> 58:16.261
Jesus fucking Christ.

58:19.233 --> 58:21.166
Hey. Hey.
It's okay. It's okay.

58:21.168 --> 58:23.235
- Stay. Stay, stay.
- Help!

58:23.237 --> 58:24.737
Leave me alone!

58:24.739 --> 58:26.638
- Shh! It's okay.
- Stop!

58:26.640 --> 58:29.008
I'll explain.
I can explain, okay?

58:29.010 --> 58:30.976
We're gonna go inside now.
I'm gonna explain.

58:30.978 --> 58:33.946
Just please, come with me.
Come with me.
- Stop! Stop! Please stop!

58:33.948 --> 58:35.981
- Yeah, just come inside
and I'll fucking explain
it to you.

58:35.983 --> 58:38.784
Okay? Please?
Just come with me.
I'm sorry.

58:38.786 --> 58:41.120
I'm fucking sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's just...

58:41.122 --> 58:44.289
Hold still. Okay?
Please! Fucking please!

58:44.291 --> 58:46.658
- Please stop!
- I don't wanna fucking
hurt you.

58:46.660 --> 58:49.028
Okay? Please don't make me
fucking hurt you.

58:49.030 --> 58:50.996
Okay? Okay?

58:50.998 --> 58:53.032
Just come on.
I'm sorry.

58:53.034 --> 58:54.299
I'm fucking sorry.

58:54.301 --> 58:56.602
Let's go inside.
Let's go inside.

58:56.604 --> 58:59.038
Here. Okay?
Okay.

58:59.040 --> 59:01.173
Okay.
What the fuck?

59:03.978 --> 59:06.781
- Don't worry, you'll be fine.

59:07.048 --> 59:11.250
- Stop. Stop. Stop.
Stop it.

59:11.252 --> 59:14.053
Stop it.

59:14.055 --> 59:16.590
Did you just shove
me, you fucking bitch?

59:18.225 --> 59:19.960
What the fuck is this?

59:23.898 --> 59:25.664
- Hey. Hey.
Hey, babe.

59:25.666 --> 59:27.833
- Get the fuck off of me.
Get the fuck off of me!

59:30.204 --> 59:31.670
- Craig, where are you going?
Craig, Jesus!

59:31.672 --> 59:33.739
- Craig!
- Craig! Craig!

59:33.741 --> 59:35.374
Craig! Craig!

59:35.376 --> 59:37.309
- We don't need him. Okay?

59:37.311 --> 59:39.978
We don't fucking need him.

59:39.980 --> 59:42.783
You don't need him.

59:42.950 --> 59:45.250
You are better than him.
He is a little fucking pussy.

59:45.252 --> 59:46.785
Do you understand?

59:46.787 --> 59:48.887
We don't need him.

59:48.889 --> 59:50.055
Shut up, shut up.

59:50.057 --> 59:51.957
- Outside.
Everyone, outside to talk.

59:51.959 --> 59:53.826
Don't move. Don't move.

59:53.828 --> 59:56.361
Outside now.
All of you.

59:56.363 --> 59:59.698
- We are fucking watching you!
Do you fucking understand that?

59:59.700 --> 1:00:02.668
That gun is on you at
all fucking times! Kim!

1:00:02.670 --> 1:00:04.805
- Yes.
- Keep it on them!
- Yes.

1:00:05.039 --> 1:00:06.738
I got them. I got them.

1:00:06.740 --> 1:00:08.807
- Okay.
They're moving closer.

1:00:08.809 --> 1:00:10.375
- We gotta scare
the shit out of them.

1:00:10.377 --> 1:00:12.344
- They have seen our faces.
They know who we are.

1:00:12.346 --> 1:00:14.146
- Is that really gonna work
if we just scare them?

1:00:14.148 --> 1:00:15.948
- Yeah. We just have to scare
the shit of them.

1:00:15.950 --> 1:00:17.216
- I don't know.
I don't know.

1:00:17.218 --> 1:00:19.251
She's tough,
you know, she has...

1:00:19.253 --> 1:00:22.855
- Then we really scare
the shit out of them.

1:00:25.292 --> 1:00:27.860
- I can't, I can't.

1:00:27.862 --> 1:00:29.761
- Kim. Kim.

1:00:29.763 --> 1:00:31.396
- I need my babies.
I can't.

1:00:31.398 --> 1:00:33.732
- I understand.
And you can do this.

1:00:33.734 --> 1:00:35.934
I need you.
I can't do this alone, Kim.

1:00:35.936 --> 1:00:37.936
Okay?
- Stop looking at me!

1:00:37.938 --> 1:00:39.438
- Okay, I need you to calm
down and think.

1:00:39.440 --> 1:00:41.373
- Yeah. Yeah, I am calm!
- Okay? You're calm. Okay.

1:00:41.375 --> 1:00:44.009
- I think it's the only way.
Emily, it's the only way.

1:00:44.011 --> 1:00:47.412
We just gotta go really hard
and scare the shit out of them
and just fucking commit.

1:00:47.414 --> 1:00:50.718
- I mean, is there anything
else we're not thinking of?

1:00:51.218 --> 1:00:53.285
They weren't supposed
to be fucking home.

1:00:53.287 --> 1:00:55.387
- Okay, listen. Okay.
Everyone just needs to relax.

1:00:55.389 --> 1:00:58.390
All right? This shit isn't
that complicated.

1:00:58.392 --> 1:01:01.360
Kim. Kim, you are tight

1:01:01.362 --> 1:01:03.729
with every single fucking cop
that comes into the store.

1:01:03.731 --> 1:01:05.264
I have seen it.

1:01:05.266 --> 1:01:09.034
If they ask us anything,
we'll deny it.

1:01:09.036 --> 1:01:10.269
All right?
- Yeah.

1:01:10.271 --> 1:01:12.304
- We will get rid of
all of our evidence.

1:01:12.306 --> 1:01:15.240
Get rid of our fingerprints...
everything that we ever fucking
touched in here.

1:01:15.242 --> 1:01:17.943
Get rid of our trash
and that's it. All right?

1:01:17.945 --> 1:01:21.113
It's their word against
ours with no evidence.

1:01:21.115 --> 1:01:24.049
And trust me, by the time
I'm fucking done with
these bitches,

1:01:24.051 --> 1:01:25.784
I swear to God, they will
fucking leave town.

1:01:25.786 --> 1:01:27.886
All right? All right?

1:01:27.888 --> 1:01:29.888
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna fix this.

1:01:29.890 --> 1:01:31.990
Kim, I'm gonna fix this.

1:01:31.992 --> 1:01:33.727
All right?

1:01:34.128 --> 1:01:35.961
And this part will be fun.

1:01:35.963 --> 1:01:37.029
- Oh my God.

1:01:37.031 --> 1:01:38.830
- We need to...
- Okay.

1:01:38.832 --> 1:01:40.401
- We need to...
- Shh.

1:01:41.101 --> 1:01:43.304
Let's scare the shit
out of them.

1:01:44.438 --> 1:01:45.906
We clean up.

1:01:46.440 --> 1:01:48.373
And we're out.
- We should leave right now.

1:01:48.375 --> 1:01:50.077
We should leave right now.
- Yeah.

1:01:50.778 --> 1:01:52.246
- Then leave.

1:01:53.047 --> 1:01:54.746
Just go.

1:01:54.748 --> 1:01:56.050
- Shit.

1:01:57.818 --> 1:01:59.519
- Okay. Are we gonna do it?

1:01:59.521 --> 1:02:02.354
- Why would you show
up for a meeting dressed
like a fucking whore?

1:02:02.356 --> 1:02:04.024
Disrespect!

1:02:04.325 --> 1:02:06.225
Get the fuck in here!
- Oh my God.

1:02:06.227 --> 1:02:08.528
Fuck!
Will you help me?
Please, Marjorie?

1:02:08.530 --> 1:02:11.396
- I just wanted some fucking
wine! Jesus fucking Christ!

1:02:11.398 --> 1:02:13.865
- They're touching each other.
- Okay. I got it!

1:02:13.867 --> 1:02:16.768
I got it! Kim!
I got it!

1:02:16.770 --> 1:02:19.271
- Jesus Christ!
- Let go. Let go.

1:02:19.273 --> 1:02:21.907
- Get the fuck off of her.
- Jesus.

1:02:21.909 --> 1:02:25.077
Jesus fucking Christ.

1:02:25.079 --> 1:02:26.445
- Stop moving!

1:02:26.447 --> 1:02:29.281
- This is all because
you decided

1:02:29.283 --> 1:02:31.483
to stand the fuck up
for yourself.

1:02:31.485 --> 1:02:33.185
- Calm down.

1:02:33.187 --> 1:02:34.953
Emily. Emily.
- Hey, little bitch.

1:02:34.955 --> 1:02:36.955
Hey, little bitch.
I need your fucking phone.

1:02:36.957 --> 1:02:38.790
I need to play some
fucking music.

1:02:38.792 --> 1:02:40.292
- Oh! Hold on.
You know what?

1:02:40.294 --> 1:02:42.294
I bet you her phone
is in her purse.

1:02:42.296 --> 1:02:44.296
Wonder if you have any
more whore money.

1:02:44.298 --> 1:02:46.031
- Okay. Fuck. Okay.

1:02:46.033 --> 1:02:47.466
- This is the United
States of America.

1:02:47.468 --> 1:02:49.368
- Oh, shit.
- It's not your fucking
country, is it?

1:02:49.370 --> 1:02:51.069
- Okay. Wait.
Will you take her phone?
- Wait.

1:02:51.071 --> 1:02:53.238
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Yeah. That's...

1:02:53.240 --> 1:02:55.209
What kind of tunes
do you like, honey?

1:02:55.710 --> 1:02:59.478
- Emily! Emily, please
just let my sister go!
- Got it!

1:02:59.480 --> 1:03:01.380
All right, let's see...

1:03:01.382 --> 1:03:03.048
- Oh, wait...
- Got it.

1:03:03.050 --> 1:03:05.017
- You want us to let
your sister go?

1:03:07.087 --> 1:03:08.887
You want her
to be let go?

1:03:08.889 --> 1:03:10.590
Okay. Maybe we should
let her go.

1:03:10.592 --> 1:03:13.125
Well, you know what actually,
you look so frail.

1:03:13.127 --> 1:03:16.194
How about we feed her?

1:03:16.196 --> 1:03:17.929
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1:03:17.931 --> 1:03:22.234
Maybe get some food
in her. It's protein.

1:03:22.236 --> 1:03:24.970
Yeah.
How about you, Marjorie?

1:03:24.972 --> 1:03:28.006
How about we feed her?

1:03:28.008 --> 1:03:30.042
- Shut up.
Get the fuck away from me.

1:03:30.044 --> 1:03:32.344
Stop moving.
Stop fucking with your sister.

1:03:32.346 --> 1:03:34.112
Calm down.
I'm not gonna break you.

1:03:34.114 --> 1:03:35.548
I'm just gonna fucking feed you.

1:03:38.352 --> 1:03:40.287
- Get her fucking hands.

1:03:41.955 --> 1:03:44.022
- Open up.
Open your mouth.

1:03:44.024 --> 1:03:47.560
- Here you go.
How about a banana?

1:03:47.562 --> 1:03:50.429
Yeah. You wanna come
with us and eat a banana?

1:03:50.431 --> 1:03:53.500
- Have some banana.
- I think she's finding
it a little dry.

1:03:56.638 --> 1:03:59.541
- A little liquid.
A little liquid.

1:04:06.213 --> 1:04:08.215
Oh. There it is.
Here you go.

1:04:08.650 --> 1:04:10.550
Are you fucking thirsty?

1:04:10.552 --> 1:04:12.451
Get it open.

1:04:12.453 --> 1:04:14.252
- Here you go.
Here you go.

1:04:14.254 --> 1:04:15.989
- She's thirsty.

1:04:17.157 --> 1:04:20.025
Your hair is so dry, baby doll.

1:04:20.027 --> 1:04:22.194
Did you steal that
whiskey from my fucking store?

1:04:22.196 --> 1:04:24.630
Let's moisturize it for you.

1:04:45.919 --> 1:04:49.221
- There you go.
There you go.

1:04:49.223 --> 1:04:51.559
- Stop moving! Stop it!

1:04:53.427 --> 1:04:56.529
Marjorie!
What are you doing?

1:04:56.531 --> 1:04:58.566
- I'm taking a video
with her phone.

1:04:58.966 --> 1:05:00.966
- What are you doing?

1:05:00.968 --> 1:05:03.201
What did you not understand
about leaving no trace?

1:05:03.203 --> 1:05:05.971
- Well, I just thought
it was a fucking video.
- Jesus fucking Christ.

1:05:07.575 --> 1:05:10.242
- Hey! Look at me.
Look at me.

1:05:10.244 --> 1:05:13.145
Look at me.
Look at me.

1:05:13.147 --> 1:05:16.047
Were we ever here?

1:05:16.049 --> 1:05:17.650
- Were we ever here?
- Were we ever here?

1:05:17.652 --> 1:05:20.586
- Were we ever fucking here?
- Were we ever here?

1:05:20.588 --> 1:05:24.324
- You liar.
- Are you ever gonna fucking
say anything?

1:05:24.759 --> 1:05:27.259
- You are a lying little
whore, aren't you?

1:05:27.261 --> 1:05:29.062
- Were we ever here?

1:05:29.363 --> 1:05:31.631
She's choking.
- She's choking.

1:05:31.633 --> 1:05:34.266
She is choking.
Oh my God. Hit her on
the back.

1:05:34.268 --> 1:05:36.636
Hit her on the back.
- Get it off.

1:05:36.638 --> 1:05:38.671
Get it off.
A little help here!

1:05:38.673 --> 1:05:40.706
- Fuck! Fuck!

1:05:40.708 --> 1:05:42.642
- What is wrong with her?

1:05:42.644 --> 1:05:44.710
What is wrong with her?
- What is wrong with her?

1:05:44.712 --> 1:05:46.411
- What is wrong?
- Get her up.

1:05:46.413 --> 1:05:48.146
She's choking.
Oh my God.

1:05:48.148 --> 1:05:50.215
Oh my God.
What's wrong with her?

1:05:50.217 --> 1:05:53.318
Peanuts! Peanuts.
She's allergic to peanuts.

1:05:53.320 --> 1:05:55.588
- Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

1:05:55.590 --> 1:05:58.524
- Get her EpiPen in
the purse in my room, please.

1:05:58.526 --> 1:06:01.092
I'm sorry.
I can't hear you.

1:06:01.094 --> 1:06:04.630
- Please. Please. Please.
I can't...
I'm sorry, what were you saying?

1:06:04.632 --> 1:06:06.398
- Lily. No, no, no.

1:06:06.400 --> 1:06:09.234
- Oh my God.
What the fuck is that?

1:06:09.236 --> 1:06:11.269
- Hurry!
Oh, no, no.

1:06:11.271 --> 1:06:14.139
- Fuck. Holy shit.
Fucking shit.

1:06:14.141 --> 1:06:15.641
- Oh my God.
- Look at me.

1:06:15.643 --> 1:06:18.410
- Oh my God.
- Lily. Lily. Lily.

1:06:18.412 --> 1:06:21.480
Look at me, Lily.
Open, no. No, no, no.

1:06:21.482 --> 1:06:23.315
Stay with me, baby.
Stay with me.

1:06:23.317 --> 1:06:26.017
I love you, baby. Don't...

1:06:26.019 --> 1:06:28.320
- Epinephrine
for allergic reactions.

1:06:28.322 --> 1:06:30.190
Hurry!
Give it to her!

1:06:30.558 --> 1:06:32.727
- Kinda looks like we're
too late though.

1:06:40.735 --> 1:06:42.234
- No.

1:06:42.236 --> 1:06:45.370
Oh, no, no, no.

1:06:45.372 --> 1:06:47.405
- Fuck. Fuck!
- Oh, no, baby.

1:06:47.407 --> 1:06:49.474
- Shit. Oh my God.
- Lily.

1:06:49.476 --> 1:06:51.042
- Oh, my fucking God.
- Lily, wake up.

1:06:51.044 --> 1:06:53.044
- What's happened to her?
- Oh, no, no, no.

1:06:53.046 --> 1:06:55.681
What did you do?

1:06:55.683 --> 1:06:57.550
Oh, God.

1:06:57.552 --> 1:06:59.519
- You did it to yourselves.

1:06:59.521 --> 1:07:03.221
- She fucking resisted.
She fought back.

1:07:03.223 --> 1:07:06.157
It would've been easier
for her if she'd stopped
and had some respect.

1:07:06.159 --> 1:07:08.360
- Why did you do this?
- It's her fault.
It's her fault.

1:07:08.362 --> 1:07:11.129
- No, baby. Wake up,
Lily. I love you.

1:07:11.131 --> 1:07:15.066
No, no, no, no, no.

1:07:15.068 --> 1:07:18.470
Wake up. Wake up.
Oh, no, no, no.

1:07:26.280 --> 1:07:27.782
Oh, no.

1:07:31.184 --> 1:07:32.818
Kim, what
are you doing?

1:07:32.820 --> 1:07:35.588
- We have to make sure that...
-  Take these.

1:07:35.590 --> 1:07:37.422
- Okay.
- What are you doing?

1:07:37.424 --> 1:07:39.124
We have to make sure this
place is spotless.

1:07:39.126 --> 1:07:41.192
We have to wipe down
every surface.

1:07:41.194 --> 1:07:42.595
We have to take all
of our trash.

1:07:42.597 --> 1:07:45.598
- What about her?
- I am not losing my kids.

1:07:45.600 --> 1:07:47.365
Do you understand me?
I'm not.

1:07:47.367 --> 1:07:49.334
None of this has gone
the way I wanted it to go.

1:07:49.336 --> 1:07:51.871
Try to relax! Okay?

1:07:51.873 --> 1:07:54.540
- You! You!
You did this!

1:07:54.542 --> 1:07:56.408
- I didn't do anything!
- You did this!

1:07:56.410 --> 1:07:58.443
- You trash!
We did this for you!

1:07:58.445 --> 1:08:01.179
- No, I didn't!
- You did this! You did!

1:08:01.181 --> 1:08:03.783
- We did this for your
ass so fuck you!

1:08:03.785 --> 1:08:05.785
- Shut up! Shut up!

1:08:05.787 --> 1:08:07.587
It is nobody's fucking fault!

1:08:07.589 --> 1:08:08.888
We didn't fucking know

1:08:08.890 --> 1:08:10.590
that she was fucking
allergic to peanuts.

1:08:10.592 --> 1:08:12.558
So shut up!

1:08:47.528 --> 1:08:49.194
- Marjorie.

1:08:49.196 --> 1:08:50.565
Marjorie!

1:08:51.131 --> 1:08:52.900
Get in here!

1:08:54.267 --> 1:08:55.735
Kim.
- What?

1:08:55.737 --> 1:08:57.270
- Come here.

1:08:57.505 --> 1:09:00.173
We all need to get
gloves on, okay?

1:09:00.775 --> 1:09:02.273
- What?

1:09:02.275 --> 1:09:04.244
- Put gloves on.

1:09:09.717 --> 1:09:11.416
Oh my God.

1:09:11.418 --> 1:09:13.286
- We need to make it
look like a rape.

1:09:14.287 --> 1:09:15.788
- What?

1:09:15.790 --> 1:09:19.359
- No one's ever gonna suspect
women if they're raped.

1:09:21.629 --> 1:09:23.696
- Why are you looking at me?
I'm not gonna fucking do it.

1:09:23.698 --> 1:09:25.330
- Kim, I'm not asking
you to do it.

1:09:25.332 --> 1:09:26.866
- I can't...

1:09:26.868 --> 1:09:28.868
I can't...
We should go.

1:09:28.870 --> 1:09:31.837
- No!
We need to clean up our mess.

1:09:31.839 --> 1:09:33.873
- Look, it's no one's
fault, okay?

1:09:33.875 --> 1:09:35.306
Just do it.

1:09:35.308 --> 1:09:36.811
- I'm going to.

1:09:37.612 --> 1:09:40.780
- I am helping clean.
- I need a fucking carrot.

1:09:40.782 --> 1:09:42.782
- I'll just keep cleaning.
Oh, God.

1:09:42.784 --> 1:09:45.553
We shouldn't have worn shoes.
I'll tell you that much.

1:09:47.487 --> 1:09:50.455
No. No. No.

1:09:50.457 --> 1:09:53.626
- Shut the fuck up.
Shut up!

1:09:53.628 --> 1:09:56.496
No! No!

1:09:56.798 --> 1:10:00.902
- This is how you learn.

1:10:01.501 --> 1:10:05.403
You deserve it.

1:10:05.405 --> 1:10:08.373
- Oh, God.
Oh my God.

1:10:08.375 --> 1:10:10.241
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

1:10:10.243 --> 1:10:13.012
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

1:10:14.782 --> 1:10:16.784
- Oh my God.

1:10:25.893 --> 1:10:27.392
- Bitch.

1:10:40.273 --> 1:10:44.677
- I'm... I'm really sorry
that I yelled at you.

1:10:44.679 --> 1:10:46.946
Okay?
- Okay.

1:10:46.948 --> 1:10:50.348
- I was just really,
really panicked.

1:10:50.350 --> 1:10:51.550
- I know.

1:10:51.552 --> 1:10:53.320
- And you didn't do
anything wrong.

1:10:56.289 --> 1:11:00.458
And I don't think I can do it.

1:11:00.460 --> 1:11:02.262
And...

1:11:04.565 --> 1:11:06.966
I know that you're
really strong.

1:11:06.968 --> 1:11:08.603
So...

1:11:08.936 --> 1:11:10.335
- Yeah.

1:11:10.337 --> 1:11:12.339
Yeah, I'll do it.

1:11:13.440 --> 1:11:15.342
I'll do this for you.

1:11:15.710 --> 1:11:17.845
And then you'll model
my clothes for me.

1:11:18.378 --> 1:11:20.648
What?

1:11:21.249 --> 1:11:23.816
- My clothes.
For the online store.

1:11:23.818 --> 1:11:25.985
You'll model them.

1:11:25.987 --> 1:11:28.623
Oh, God.
- Yeah.

1:11:31.993 --> 1:11:33.795
Oh, God.

1:11:38.166 --> 1:11:40.398
I'm gonna throw up.
Kim.

1:11:40.400 --> 1:11:43.102
Go outside
and find something for the body.

1:11:43.104 --> 1:11:44.906
Okay?

1:11:45.372 --> 1:11:47.405
- Oh, Jesus. Fuck.

1:12:09.764 --> 1:12:11.098
Fuck.

1:12:15.603 --> 1:12:17.503
I found this.

1:12:17.505 --> 1:12:19.972
I don't know what to do.
- That works. That works.

1:12:19.974 --> 1:12:22.375
- Okay. Okay.

1:12:23.144 --> 1:12:24.944
- Marjorie.
- What?

1:12:24.946 --> 1:12:26.612
- Come help me.

1:12:26.614 --> 1:12:28.348
Come help me.

1:12:28.616 --> 1:12:31.116
Come help me.
- What the fuck?

1:12:31.118 --> 1:12:33.384
- All of our trash goes in here.

1:12:33.386 --> 1:12:34.789
Okay?

1:12:36.557 --> 1:12:38.057
- Oh my God.

1:12:38.059 --> 1:12:40.025
Oh my God. Oh my God.
Oh my God.

1:12:40.027 --> 1:12:42.761
- Breathe.

1:12:42.763 --> 1:12:44.830
Breathe.
I need you to breathe.

1:12:44.832 --> 1:12:46.431
Okay?

1:12:46.433 --> 1:12:48.667
Can you carry these cans?

1:12:48.669 --> 1:12:51.070
- Okay.
- Can you carry these cans?

1:12:51.072 --> 1:12:53.639
Okay. Good. Good.

1:12:53.641 --> 1:12:55.975
Where are we taking them?

1:12:55.977 --> 1:12:58.777
- We're taking it to the lake.
- Okay.

1:12:58.779 --> 1:13:00.946
- And the bag needs to sink,
okay?

1:13:00.948 --> 1:13:03.849
- Oh, fuck.
- Can you carry these?

1:13:03.851 --> 1:13:06.852
Breathe.
- Okay. Yeah.

1:13:06.854 --> 1:13:08.988
- Breathe. Breathe.

1:13:08.990 --> 1:13:10.522
Okay. Okay.

1:13:10.524 --> 1:13:12.091
- I'll just take them
to the car.

1:13:12.093 --> 1:13:14.128
- Take them. Okay.

1:13:25.206 --> 1:13:27.407
Fuck.

1:13:39.220 --> 1:13:40.855
Fuck.

1:13:49.597 --> 1:13:51.764
Guys, we have to go.

1:13:51.766 --> 1:13:52.965
Right now.

1:13:52.967 --> 1:13:54.802
- All right.

1:13:55.236 --> 1:13:57.002
- Fuck, they're heavy.

1:13:57.004 --> 1:13:59.472
- Push it.
- I got it. I got it.

1:14:00.041 --> 1:14:02.675
Don't slip, her fucking
spit's all on the floor.

1:14:02.677 --> 1:14:04.777
Oh, fuck. Fuck.

1:14:04.779 --> 1:14:07.715
Fuck. Fuck.

1:14:08.749 --> 1:14:10.952
Fuck. Fuck.

1:14:12.485 --> 1:14:13.619
Okay.

1:14:13.621 --> 1:14:15.654
Okay. Okay.

1:14:15.656 --> 1:14:17.457
Okay.

1:14:18.526 --> 1:14:19.994
Okay...

1:14:21.896 --> 1:14:23.862
Got to clean.

1:14:23.864 --> 1:14:25.698
Got to clean this.

1:14:25.700 --> 1:14:27.168
Fuck.

1:14:37.144 --> 1:14:38.946
Okay.

1:14:46.053 --> 1:14:48.155
Okay. Okay.

1:15:03.537 --> 1:15:05.239
Okay...

1:15:18.652 --> 1:15:21.088
Okay, okay...

1:15:35.803 --> 1:15:37.302
Emily, hurry up!

1:15:37.304 --> 1:15:39.571
What the fuck are you
doing in there?

1:15:39.573 --> 1:15:40.939
- Okay.

1:15:40.941 --> 1:15:42.141
Okay.

1:15:42.143 --> 1:15:44.111
Okay, okay.

1:15:56.157 --> 1:15:58.159
Fuck...

1:16:01.228 --> 1:16:03.030
Fuck!

1:16:03.330 --> 1:16:05.330
Go! Get out.

1:16:05.332 --> 1:16:07.735
Go. Okay.

1:16:08.969 --> 1:16:10.836
Okay, stay. Stay. Stay.

1:16:10.838 --> 1:16:12.840
Okay. Okay.

1:16:13.374 --> 1:16:14.975
Oh, fuck.

1:16:32.326 --> 1:16:33.826
She is fucking heavy!

1:16:33.828 --> 1:16:35.027
Marjorie, will you help me?

1:16:35.029 --> 1:16:36.829
Get your shit together.

1:16:36.831 --> 1:16:38.732
Jesus!

1:16:39.066 --> 1:16:42.167
Marjorie, just take another
fucking shot or something!

1:16:45.406 --> 1:16:47.806
- Hey. Hey. Hey.

1:16:47.808 --> 1:16:49.775
Breathe. Breathe.

1:16:49.777 --> 1:16:51.643
Breathe. Breathe.

1:16:51.645 --> 1:16:53.946
Breathe. Breathe.

1:16:53.948 --> 1:16:56.215
- Okay. Okay.

1:16:56.217 --> 1:16:58.150
Okay.

1:16:58.152 --> 1:16:59.685
- Listen to me.

1:16:59.687 --> 1:17:01.286
- Okay.
- We need you to get in the car.

1:17:01.288 --> 1:17:03.388
Get in the car.
- Okay. Yeah.

1:17:03.390 --> 1:17:05.059
Okay.

1:17:07.928 --> 1:17:09.228
- Are we good?

1:17:09.230 --> 1:17:10.696
We're good.

1:17:10.698 --> 1:17:12.366
Just get in the fucking car.

1:17:17.738 --> 1:17:19.773
Get in the fucking car!

1:17:25.880 --> 1:17:28.749
- Did you get everything?
- I got everything.

1:17:29.383 --> 1:17:30.550
After we dump them,

1:17:30.552 --> 1:17:33.318
we gotta come back here and
we gotta clean everything.

1:17:33.320 --> 1:17:35.020
- Okay.
- Carefully.

1:17:35.022 --> 1:17:36.388
Okay?
- Okay.

1:17:36.390 --> 1:17:38.056
Yes.

1:17:38.058 --> 1:17:42.094
Every single inch
and we'll erase fingerprints.

1:17:42.096 --> 1:17:44.263
- Everything will be spotless.
- Everything.

1:17:44.265 --> 1:17:47.132
It will be fine.
No one.

1:17:47.134 --> 1:17:50.271
No one will know we were there.
No one will ever find out.

1:17:51.172 --> 1:17:52.437
Okay?

1:17:52.439 --> 1:17:53.939
Oh, fuck.

1:18:01.348 --> 1:18:02.714
You're okay.

1:18:02.716 --> 1:18:04.016
We're okay.

1:18:04.018 --> 1:18:05.417
Huh...

1:18:05.419 --> 1:18:07.288
Is...

1:18:07.888 --> 1:18:10.255
- Is your boat...
- Where are we going?

1:18:10.257 --> 1:18:13.158
Where is your boat?
I don't...
It's by the pier.

1:18:13.160 --> 1:18:15.896
- Which pier?
-  The one by that abandoned house.

1:18:16.997 --> 1:18:18.897
By the... Okay.

1:18:18.899 --> 1:18:20.399
We're gonna take
them there, okay?

1:18:20.401 --> 1:18:22.736
We should just be
burying them in
the woods.

1:18:23.771 --> 1:18:26.471
With what, Leslie?

1:18:26.473 --> 1:18:28.106
- With a fucking shovel!

1:18:28.108 --> 1:18:29.441
- Where are we gonna get
a fucking shovel?

1:18:29.443 --> 1:18:30.943
- I bet you they fucking
had one!

1:18:30.945 --> 1:18:32.744
- Will you just shut
the fuck up?
- Fuck you!

1:18:32.746 --> 1:18:34.913
- Shut the fuck up!
- You are the one who
fucking told us...

1:18:34.915 --> 1:18:36.748
- Shut up!
- ...so don't piss me
the fuck off!

1:18:36.750 --> 1:18:38.984
- This is your fucking fault!
- You are screaming at me!
Fuck you!

1:18:38.986 --> 1:18:40.485
I did this for you!
I have good ideas!

1:18:40.487 --> 1:18:43.188
I could get the fuck out
of this car right now,

1:18:43.190 --> 1:18:44.756
then you're on
your fucking own!

1:18:44.758 --> 1:18:46.058
- Okay. Okay.
- Do you understand me?

1:18:46.060 --> 1:18:47.893
- No, no, no. Please.

1:18:47.895 --> 1:18:51.263
Calm down. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1:18:51.265 --> 1:18:53.033
I'm sorry.

1:18:53.901 --> 1:18:55.269
I'm sorry.

1:19:03.944 --> 1:19:05.978
Test me again, Emily,

1:19:05.980 --> 1:19:08.282
and see where it
fucking gets you.

1:20:19.353 --> 1:20:21.221
- Kim, are we almost there?

1:20:22.890 --> 1:20:25.159
- Are we almost there?
- Yes. Yes.

1:20:33.067 --> 1:20:35.568
Marjorie, if you reach
into the glove compartment...

1:20:35.570 --> 1:20:39.371
there should be
a headlamp in there

1:20:39.373 --> 1:20:41.108
from one of my kiddos.

1:20:42.109 --> 1:20:43.477
- Okay.

1:20:44.178 --> 1:20:45.545
Just...

1:20:45.547 --> 1:20:47.647
- I got it.
- Did you get it?

1:20:47.649 --> 1:20:49.283
- Yeah, I got it.
- Okay, good.

1:20:50.951 --> 1:20:53.485
- I'll get... I'll get out,
and...

1:20:53.487 --> 1:20:55.253
Wait for the car
to pass us.

1:20:55.255 --> 1:20:56.922
- ...and open the gate.
Yeah.

1:21:28.989 --> 1:21:30.625
Kim.

1:21:36.664 --> 1:21:38.298
Come on.

1:21:40.934 --> 1:21:42.403
Come on.

1:21:42.936 --> 1:21:44.271
Okay.

1:21:47.609 --> 1:21:50.442
- Marjorie, sorry I need
that headlamp that my boy left
in there.

1:21:50.444 --> 1:21:52.277
- Listen.
- What?
- You're gonna need this.

1:21:52.279 --> 1:21:55.046
- Yeah. Thank you.
You're gonna pull
the car around...

1:21:55.048 --> 1:21:57.650
and bring the bag down
to the shore and meet me,
okay?

1:21:57.652 --> 1:21:59.353
- Okay.

1:21:59.953 --> 1:22:01.355
- Okay.

1:23:24.539 --> 1:23:26.240
No...

1:23:39.721 --> 1:23:41.288
Fuck.

1:23:59.574 --> 1:24:01.141
Fuck!

1:24:02.744 --> 1:24:04.376
God damn it.

1:24:04.378 --> 1:24:05.613
Fuck!

1:24:05.847 --> 1:24:07.314
Oh!

1:24:12.820 --> 1:24:14.119
Fuck.

1:24:14.121 --> 1:24:15.220
Fuck me.

1:24:15.222 --> 1:24:16.556
Fuck.

1:24:16.558 --> 1:24:18.593
Okay. Okay.

1:24:29.436 --> 1:24:31.271
Okay. Okay.

1:24:31.573 --> 1:24:33.440
Okay. Okay.

1:24:33.675 --> 1:24:35.710
Okay. Okay...

1:24:39.379 --> 1:24:41.148
Fuck.

1:24:50.525 --> 1:24:51.724
Okay.

1:24:51.726 --> 1:24:53.391
- You're okay.

1:24:53.393 --> 1:24:54.727
- We need to get them
on the boat.

1:24:54.729 --> 1:24:56.394
- I'm pushing.
I'm pushing.

1:24:56.396 --> 1:24:58.332
- Yeah.
- Got it?

1:24:58.800 --> 1:25:00.566
I'm coming.

1:25:00.568 --> 1:25:02.500
I'm coming.
- Emily, you okay?
- Oh my God.

1:25:02.502 --> 1:25:04.469
- Coming. I'm coming.
I'm coming. Whoa!

1:25:04.471 --> 1:25:06.271
Be quiet.
- Okay.

1:25:06.273 --> 1:25:08.676
The house is abandoned.
No one's gonna fucking hear us.

1:25:10.143 --> 1:25:11.877
- One, two.
- Three.

1:25:15.850 --> 1:25:17.282
- Fuck.
- Okay.

1:25:17.284 --> 1:25:19.152
You get on that side, Kim.

1:25:19.921 --> 1:25:21.921
Okay, so pull.
We're pulling it.

1:25:21.923 --> 1:25:23.758
- Push.
- Push.

1:25:25.893 --> 1:25:27.560
- Keep going.

1:25:27.562 --> 1:25:29.227
We got to get out of the mud.

1:25:33.400 --> 1:25:35.333
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

1:25:35.335 --> 1:25:37.435
- Marjorie, get in
the back and help.

1:25:37.437 --> 1:25:39.304
- Okay.
I'll go around.

1:25:39.306 --> 1:25:42.708
- Get up.
- Get in there.

1:25:42.710 --> 1:25:45.276
- Jesus. I'm trying to!
Help!

1:25:45.278 --> 1:25:46.748
- Okay.

1:25:49.651 --> 1:25:51.751
- See?
You needed a fucking friend.

1:25:51.753 --> 1:25:54.654
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

1:25:54.656 --> 1:25:56.689
One of you in here with me.

1:25:56.691 --> 1:25:58.358
- I'll go.

1:26:01.328 --> 1:26:02.595
Shit.

1:26:02.597 --> 1:26:04.431
- Okay.

1:26:04.766 --> 1:26:06.331
- Okay.

1:26:06.333 --> 1:26:08.168
Push us. Ready?

1:26:10.705 --> 1:26:11.704
One.

1:26:11.706 --> 1:26:12.972
- Idiots!

1:26:12.974 --> 1:26:14.707
- Fuck you, Marjorie!

1:26:14.709 --> 1:26:16.276
- Fuck you.

1:26:16.611 --> 1:26:18.211
- Just fucking go.

1:26:21.281 --> 1:26:22.882
- It's getting too deep.

1:26:22.884 --> 1:26:24.650
I can't push any farther.

1:26:24.652 --> 1:26:25.785
- Emily?

1:26:25.787 --> 1:26:27.953
One, two, go!

1:26:27.955 --> 1:26:29.287
- Sorry.

1:26:29.289 --> 1:26:31.592
- One, two, three.

1:26:32.560 --> 1:26:35.663
One, two, three.

1:26:37.497 --> 1:26:39.199
Fuck.

1:26:57.317 --> 1:27:00.420
One, two, three.
- Three.

1:27:00.855 --> 1:27:03.858
- One, two, three.

1:27:06.393 --> 1:27:08.529
Here?
- Further.

1:27:12.600 --> 1:27:14.466
- Here?
- Further.

1:27:14.468 --> 1:27:16.436
- Jesus Christ.

1:27:24.344 --> 1:27:25.780
Here?

1:27:26.948 --> 1:27:29.817
- Here. Okay.
Here.

1:27:35.523 --> 1:27:37.792
Help me.
- I'm helping.

1:27:40.962 --> 1:27:42.563
Fucking...

1:28:02.415 --> 1:28:03.885
- We did it.

1:28:06.521 --> 1:28:08.055
We did it.

1:28:09.422 --> 1:28:11.993
Leslie, we did it.

1:28:12.760 --> 1:28:14.494
Let's go.

1:28:15.129 --> 1:28:17.863
Turn. Turn.
One, two, three.

1:28:17.865 --> 1:28:19.667
Hold on.
