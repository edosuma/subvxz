To be more accurate,
it’s an attempt at mimicry.

Look, it turns out
the receiver is also a transmitter.

28:06.687 --> 28:10.236
They weren’t just trying to learn,
they were attempting to teach theirs...

28:10.407 --> 28:12.318
... by sending auditory
and visual signals.

28:12.487 --> 28:15.126
While doing that, they experienced
a traumatic moment...

28:15.287 --> 28:17.676
... which the whales stored
in their genetic memory.

28:17.847 --> 28:20.645
- The images we’ve been seeing ?
- Exactly. Reruns.

28:20.807 --> 28:23.605
Now, unfortunately, these whales
are several generations...

28:23.767 --> 28:27.362

finding the language a tough go.

28:27.527 --> 28:29.916

Okay, so this traumatic event...

28:35.327 --> 28:37.602
l’m assuming it’s the war

28:37.767 --> 28:39.485

- Tell us something we don’t know.
- Interesting thing is...

28:48.247 --> 28:51.239
... Ancients seemed aware of
the whales’deficient mimicry skills.

28:51.407 --> 28:54.763
So they incorporated an acoustic
language filter into the receiver.

28:54.927 --> 28:57.236

so long to figure out.

30:27.127 --> 30:28.606
It’s a coronal mass ejection...

30:28.767 --> 30:31.725
... on a scale that dwarfs
anything our sun has ever emitted.

30:31.927 --> 30:34.202
Apparently, the sun in this system
goes through...

30:34.367 --> 30:37.518
... an unusually turbulent sunspot
cycle every 15,000 years or so.

30:37.687 --> 30:40.406
Ancients have records of this
class of CME occurring twice.

30:40.607 --> 30:42.484
The ship was very close to the sun.

30:42.647 --> 30:45.286
It was a massive prominence.
It arced up, and collapsed...

30:45.447 --> 30:47.085
... when the magnetic field weakened.

30:47.247 --> 30:51.638

the coronal mass ejection will occur.

32:21.247 --> 32:23.841
Within a few million miles,

... wide enough to take out

32:25.927 --> 32:26.916
How much time ?

32:27.087 --> 32:30.523
It will collapse any moment. Less
than an hour before radiation hits.

32:30.727 --> 32:33.321
- Why didn’t we notice this ?
McKAY : These things happen quickly.

32:33.487 --> 32:36.285
This kind of sunspot cycle is chaotic,
impossible to predict.

32:36.447 --> 32:39.166
That caused the glitch
in the Jumper’s navigational system.

32:39.327 --> 32:42.444
Not to mention our focus was on
attack from the Wraith, not the sun.

32:42.607 --> 32:44.438
The whales were aware
this was happening ?

32:44.607 --> 32:46.757
- A lot of animals : whales, dolphins--
- Pigeons.

- -are affected by anomalies
in the magnetosphere.

32:49.327 --> 32:51.716

32:51.887 --> 32:53.923
Pigeons ?

32:54.407 --> 32:57.479
Yeah, homing pigeons. Yes, l used

32:57.647 --> 33:00.002
We’d consult solar charts
before our pigeon races.

33:00.167 --> 33:01.964

- Rodney.

33:02.407 --> 33:04.921
It’s still a mystery
how they sense this trouble...

33:05.087 --> 33:06.600
... but they do well before we do.

33:06.807 --> 33:07.842
What are our options ?

33:08.007 --> 33:10.157
Raise the shield,
stretch it wide enough...

33:10.327 --> 33:12.283
... to protect a portion of the planet.

33:12.447 --> 33:16.725
Attenuated, more of a thin bubble,
it was able to block enough radiation.

of mass extinction...

- ... on other parts of the planet.
- Wow. Now we know what caused it.

33:22.247 --> 33:24.807
Okay, so our shield is already
activated. What else ?

33:25.007 --> 33:28.522
Small problem. The Ancients
had three ZPMs at their disposal.

33:28.687 --> 33:30.678
We, as you know, only have one.

33:30.847 --> 33:33.042
Maybe l was insistent on keeping
them because...

33:33.207 --> 33:35.880
... l, too, am able to sense
trouble on the horizon.

33:36.087 --> 33:37.202
Just like a pigeon.

33:37.407 --> 33:40.479
So we just need to get the other
two ZPMs back here temporarily.

33:43.687 --> 33:45.200
... the blast wave would hit us.

33:45.407 --> 33:47.477
How far can we extend
the shield with one ZPM ?

33:47.687 --> 33:51.043
Enough to cover the city and perhaps
a bit of the ocean surrounding it.

33:51.247 --> 33:53.715
- We should evacuate.
McKAY : We can’t gate to Earth.

33:53.927 --> 33:55.918
We need the ZPM’s power
for the shield.

- The intergalactic bridge ?
- Midway isn’t completed.

33:58.967 --> 34:01.686

by Jumper. Again, no time.

will be damaged beyond recovery...
