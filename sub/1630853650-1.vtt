WEBVTT

02:42.663 --> 02:45.999
THE PASSENGER

03:18.282 --> 03:19.950
PEST CONTROL

04:46.161 --> 04:48.622
Your country is full of them, right?

04:50.082 --> 04:52.376
I mean, full of believers.

04:53.377 --> 04:54.628
Ecuador...

04:56.672 --> 04:58.966
Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, you know?

04:59.049 --> 05:00.384
They're all faithful.

05:01.593 --> 05:03.345
The last ones the Vatican has left

05:03.428 --> 05:04.930
from whom to keep on stealing.

05:05.931 --> 05:08.100
Although Muslims
are winning by a landslide.

05:09.726 --> 05:13.021
Here, only the elderly go to Mass.

05:13.105 --> 05:13.981
Of course.

05:14.857 --> 05:18.193
When my turn comes up,
I'll do exactly the same.

05:21.280 --> 05:22.239
Just in case.

05:22.739 --> 05:23.699
And in Argentina...

05:25.242 --> 05:26.451
Oh my, Argentina.

05:27.077 --> 05:27.911
You know?

05:27.995 --> 05:31.123
They're also extremely religious.

05:31.206 --> 05:32.249
Because football...

05:32.332 --> 05:35.878
Football is the other great religion
in South America, right?

05:37.212 --> 05:39.423
I'm not South American,
I'm Mexican.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.008
Where's Mexico?

05:42.718 --> 05:44.553
In North America...

05:45.387 --> 05:48.599
Over here, in Spain,
everyone below the US

05:48.682 --> 05:49.683
is South-American.

05:51.894 --> 05:53.562
I'm not being a racist,

05:53.645 --> 05:56.690
I also have South American blood
running through my veins.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.192
My dad was from Argentina.

06:01.737 --> 06:03.989
She's a believer
and has a vow of silence.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.574
Just what I needed!

06:05.657 --> 06:08.285
She can't even string
two fucking sentences together.

06:09.411 --> 06:11.288
And it was clear in the ad:

06:11.371 --> 06:13.832
"Carlos Blasco,
a responsible driver,

06:14.666 --> 06:17.211
smoker and very talkative."

06:21.590 --> 06:22.591
EXIT
RESIDENTIAL AREA

06:22.674 --> 06:25.052
It's full of our guys,
and they're all hyped up.

06:25.135 --> 06:28.263
They better chill out,
I won't be there for another four hours.

06:28.347 --> 06:31.725
It's not because of you, bighead.
They saw a flash in the sky.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.977
Don't tell me the Virgin appeared.

06:34.061 --> 06:37.773
-That's what they say.
-Yokels... It was probably a flare.

06:37.856 --> 06:38.690
Exactly.

06:39.691 --> 06:41.735
Cadalso Street, here it is.

06:41.818 --> 06:45.531
-Come on, step on it and get here.
-All right, kisses.

06:45.614 --> 06:46.698
Faggot.

06:52.287 --> 06:53.705
We're picking someone up.

06:58.335 --> 06:59.336
We're here.

07:05.467 --> 07:06.426
Hey, what's up?

07:07.135 --> 07:08.262
You're Lidia, right?

07:10.848 --> 07:12.224
What's wrong?
Don't like it?

07:13.141 --> 07:14.935
It never mentioned it was that old.

07:15.519 --> 07:18.480
It's not old, it's experienced.

07:18.897 --> 07:22.693
I bet that you'll grow fond of it
in 30 kilometres, wait and see.

07:23.235 --> 07:25.529
Just get there on time.
Marta, let's go.

07:25.988 --> 07:28.115
This is included in the price,
don't worry.

07:28.198 --> 07:29.825
I can carry my own suitcase.

07:29.908 --> 07:32.369
I don't want you to get hurt, madam,
come with me.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.413
Brute strength is a man's job.
Let's go.

07:37.082 --> 07:38.083
Careful.
-Oh my.

07:39.209 --> 07:42.337
-I'll make some room here.
-Shall I help you?

07:42.671 --> 07:43.881
No, that's not needed.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.842
This goes here.

07:49.887 --> 07:51.138
That one goes there.

07:55.767 --> 07:56.602
Hi.

08:06.069 --> 08:06.904
What's this?

08:07.988 --> 08:09.031
A sword.

08:09.615 --> 08:11.491
I used to bullfight when I was young.

08:12.576 --> 08:14.203
Do you know what they called me?

08:14.578 --> 08:16.330
"Nativity child."

08:16.413 --> 08:17.748
Can you guess why?
-No.

08:18.290 --> 08:20.000
My birthday is on 25 December.

08:20.626 --> 08:23.045
I had to quit after my eye incident.

08:23.378 --> 08:25.797
I'm taking it to my cousin,
a junior bullfighter.

08:26.465 --> 08:27.591
Do you like bulls?

08:28.217 --> 08:30.719
I do like bulls.
I don't like them being tortured.

08:32.011 --> 08:32.846
Well...

08:33.304 --> 08:35.057
Lidia means "bullfight" in Spanish.

08:36.099 --> 08:40.687
Marta! Don't make me say it again,
come on, grab your things and get in.

08:48.987 --> 08:51.156
Do we have a problem?
-No.

08:58.413 --> 09:01.792
This is Mariela, from Mexico,
she's also going to the village.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.544
-Nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

09:04.962 --> 09:06.880
And who's this? Huh?

09:07.506 --> 09:10.759
What's your name? I'm Carlos,
but my friends call me Blasco.

09:10.843 --> 09:13.637
How old are you?
In case you want to drive.

09:13.720 --> 09:17.015
-Can you stop being a fool?
-Sorry, I didn't want to...

09:17.099 --> 09:20.269
What? Be rude?
Treat my daughter like an idiot?

09:20.894 --> 09:23.230
Marta. I'm Marta.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.984
-Hi, Marta.
-Come on, Marta, get in.

09:29.486 --> 09:30.612
I'm not sitting there.

09:34.157 --> 09:35.534
Don't make this any harder.

09:36.285 --> 09:38.370
I get car sick in the back.

09:38.871 --> 09:41.957
What? Come on, don't lie.
Get in the car, Marta.

09:42.457 --> 09:44.501
-I'm not getting in.
-Get in. Now.

09:44.585 --> 09:46.170
-I'm not getting in!
-What if...

09:46.253 --> 09:48.714
What if we move it?
I want to get to Valgarde tonight,

09:48.797 --> 09:50.215
if that's possible.
So?

10:02.060 --> 10:04.938
FOR SALE

10:18.285 --> 10:20.078
Oh, Holy...

10:31.632 --> 10:33.425
What is it?
What are you looking at?

10:36.345 --> 10:38.388
Do I have something on my face or what?

10:39.097 --> 10:40.599
Wrinkles.

10:43.101 --> 10:45.812
What a funny little girl.

10:49.191 --> 10:51.443
Hey, do you have a cigarette?
I have one left.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.487
Don't even think about it.

10:54.613 --> 10:55.531
Excuse me?

10:57.324 --> 10:58.575
It was clear in my ad.

10:58.659 --> 11:01.453
Don't even think about smoking
unless you want me to puke

11:01.537 --> 11:02.746
all over your dashboard.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.082
What the hell?

11:06.959 --> 11:08.460
What a brat.

11:09.294 --> 11:13.298
Well then?
Why do you keep looking at my face?

11:14.258 --> 11:15.425
What happened to you?

11:15.801 --> 11:17.052
To my eye?

11:17.135 --> 11:17.970
Nothing.

11:18.804 --> 11:21.223
It was my first bullfight,
with real bulls.

11:21.431 --> 11:22.975
So you're a bullfighter, huh?

11:23.392 --> 11:24.226
I used to be.

11:24.852 --> 11:25.936
And a good one at it.

11:27.062 --> 11:29.106
But anyone can have a bad day.

11:29.857 --> 11:33.485
A badly-placed banderilla
that bounces off the animal...

11:34.444 --> 11:35.779
Straight into the eye.

11:36.989 --> 11:37.865
Tough luck.

11:38.824 --> 11:40.742
I bet the bull ended up worse.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.078
To the butcher's.

11:44.872 --> 11:46.999
Do you know what?
I think you're lying.

11:47.708 --> 11:50.377
You're no bullfighter.
I doubt it's because of that.

11:50.460 --> 11:51.753
What a smart-arse.

11:52.754 --> 11:54.590
Are you an eye doctor or what?

11:54.882 --> 11:55.716
No.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.553
But I know a thing or two.

12:03.432 --> 12:04.391
Damn...

12:09.188 --> 12:10.480
What happened there?

12:14.860 --> 12:15.986
Let me guess.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.780
You were going to smoke
for the first time,

12:18.864 --> 12:21.116
and your lighter exploded in your face

12:21.783 --> 12:23.785
and that's why you hate smoking, right?

12:25.454 --> 12:26.997
Hey! Enough.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.665
This isn't funny at all.

12:28.749 --> 12:32.252
Because I'm one-eyed?
It's not so bad, madam.

12:33.587 --> 12:36.215
What's this all about?
Marta, fasten your seat belt.

12:36.798 --> 12:38.967
It looks like he's taking us
to the pound.

12:39.051 --> 12:41.929
Please calm down, ladies,
don't get all worked up

12:42.012 --> 12:42.846
back there.

12:43.347 --> 12:46.225
I installed that screen
when I had my pest control company

12:46.475 --> 12:48.435
to stop the stench of chemicals.

12:48.769 --> 12:50.312
Why haven't you removed it?

12:51.271 --> 12:53.232
I left it there quite on purpose.

12:53.315 --> 12:54.733
For health reasons.

12:55.984 --> 12:59.571
To avoid getting a virus infection
from a troublesome passenger.

13:00.864 --> 13:02.574
A female passenger,
in this case.

13:02.824 --> 13:03.992
The cheek on him.

13:04.993 --> 13:06.703
I'll file a complaint on the site.

13:06.787 --> 13:07.621
On the site?

13:07.704 --> 13:09.957
No, it's best
if you give him a bad review.

13:10.415 --> 13:12.543
That'll be much worse for him.

13:12.918 --> 13:15.128
He'll lose customers.
-Really?

13:15.212 --> 13:17.506
Loads.
And share all the details.

13:17.589 --> 13:19.633
That he was inappropriate
with your girl,

13:19.716 --> 13:22.219
a misogynist, careless,

13:22.302 --> 13:24.638
that his car is a pigsty,
look at it.

13:24.721 --> 13:27.349
-It doesn't even have seat belts.
-It's so old...

13:29.726 --> 13:31.353
-Hey.
-Yes?

13:31.895 --> 13:34.022
You know we're in the digital age,
right?

13:34.106 --> 13:35.649
Right, but fuck that.

13:35.732 --> 13:38.026
The sound of the cassette is unique.

13:38.777 --> 13:40.863
Authentic.
Vigorous.

13:44.783 --> 13:46.785
Damn, La Polla Records!
Know them?

13:47.160 --> 13:49.955
I'd play it,
but this cassette's been stuck inside...

13:50.038 --> 13:51.248
Forever.

13:51.331 --> 13:54.126
Nessa's clung to it.
She's took a liking to it.

13:56.378 --> 13:58.505
-Nessa?
-Yes, Nessa.

13:59.715 --> 14:01.800
My little girl. The love of my life.

14:02.843 --> 14:05.804
My van. My Va-Nessa.

14:07.222 --> 14:09.933
Anyway, at least
it's an auto-reverse player.

14:10.309 --> 14:12.978
It switches sides,
otherwise it would drive us mad.

14:13.478 --> 14:15.689
You can't deny
that the pasodoble is amazing.

14:17.149 --> 14:19.151
-I prefer Dua Lipa.
-Yeah...

14:19.234 --> 14:20.360
So cool.

14:21.570 --> 14:22.863
She's from Cuenca, right?

14:24.281 --> 14:25.657
From a nearby village, yes.

15:04.863 --> 15:05.822
Oh, wow.

15:06.657 --> 15:08.200
That's right, run! Champ!

15:08.283 --> 15:11.995
You might even make it
to see your wife cheating on you.

15:12.454 --> 15:14.164
Keep your rudeness to yourself.

15:14.248 --> 15:15.874
None of us want to hear it.

15:15.958 --> 15:17.251
But it's true.

15:17.334 --> 15:20.420
Men who drive like that do so
because they know their wives are...

15:20.504 --> 15:22.005
Their wives are what?

15:22.089 --> 15:24.007
Never mind.
I love women.

15:24.091 --> 15:25.133
I love them.

15:25.801 --> 15:28.262
I love my mum and grandma,
may they rest in peace.

15:28.345 --> 15:30.806
So you're entitled to say
whatever you want about us?

15:30.889 --> 15:32.516
He'll say he's a feminist next.

15:33.016 --> 15:36.478
I'm not getting caught up in that.
No fucking way. Feminist...

15:37.646 --> 15:38.605
Vade Retro.

15:39.731 --> 15:42.317
All feminists want is revenge.

15:42.401 --> 15:44.903
Revenge?
Do you really believe that?

15:45.487 --> 15:48.240
That we're primitive like you men?
That's not the case!

15:48.323 --> 15:49.950
Don't worry about that.

15:50.033 --> 15:51.410
In a few years,

15:51.493 --> 15:54.204
let's see how things are
in the legislative framework.

15:54.830 --> 15:56.415
Look at her.
Prime example.

15:56.498 --> 16:00.294
He's so backwards,
guys like him should go extinct.

16:00.377 --> 16:02.713
-We'd be all alone.
-Check them gossiping

16:02.796 --> 16:05.924
back there.
You're monsters!

16:06.008 --> 16:08.719
-I don't care.
-Great, be all silent.

16:09.511 --> 16:11.346
You're prettier that way.

16:16.602 --> 16:18.770
Marta, pass me some sweets, please.

16:19.438 --> 16:21.231
That'll be hard unless we stop.

16:22.816 --> 16:23.650
No.

16:24.359 --> 16:26.445
Check this secret out.

16:47.799 --> 16:50.427
-I like Nessa.
-No shit.

16:51.595 --> 16:53.597
We've been together
for so many years...

16:54.097 --> 16:56.808
I'll work up the nerve one day
and ask her to marry me.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.361
Are you taking the national road?

17:07.653 --> 17:11.240
Someone rich would pay 20 euros,
take the motorway

17:11.323 --> 17:15.077
and do an extra 40 kilometres.
That's not the case, madam.

17:15.160 --> 17:17.371
Your ad said no detours!

17:17.454 --> 17:19.998
One thing is no detours,
another is no tolls.

17:20.457 --> 17:23.085
In fact,
I'm not taking a detour from the route.

17:23.167 --> 17:25.462
Quite the opposite,
it's most direct route.

17:25.546 --> 17:28.841
And the cheapest too!
Son of a...

17:28.924 --> 17:32.845
Besides, we'll be able to see and enjoy
the Osborne bull on this road.

17:32.928 --> 17:36.390
A trip without the bull is bad luck.

17:36.473 --> 17:38.684
What's wrong,
don't you like the scenery?

17:38.767 --> 17:40.269
It's astonishing, right?

17:41.144 --> 17:44.022
Don't bother.
I know this road perfectly.

17:45.190 --> 17:46.692
Really?
Are you from Valgarde?

17:46.775 --> 17:47.609
Not me.

17:48.402 --> 17:49.236
My ex-husband.

17:50.737 --> 17:53.448
Oh, of course he's your ex.

17:54.408 --> 17:56.451
So you're going to see your dad, child?

17:57.911 --> 17:59.580
My mum wants me to live with him.

17:59.663 --> 18:01.582
She's tired of me, you know?

18:02.624 --> 18:03.458
I'm a bother.

18:04.543 --> 18:05.961
Marta, don't talk nonsense.

18:06.044 --> 18:08.130
We both agreed on it.

18:08.881 --> 18:10.299
And stop biting your nails!

18:12.342 --> 18:13.635
Don't worry, child.

18:15.429 --> 18:17.055
All mothers love their child.

18:18.265 --> 18:19.266
Even yours.

18:20.517 --> 18:21.351
I don't care.

18:22.311 --> 18:23.896
Neither of them cares about me.

18:24.980 --> 18:25.856
He left.

18:26.815 --> 18:29.026
And now she's abandoning me too.

18:32.279 --> 18:33.363
Fuck!

19:43.517 --> 19:46.311
Stay there!
This might be toxic!

19:47.729 --> 19:48.564
Stay there!

20:00.200 --> 20:02.202
What the fuck are you doing?

20:04.246 --> 20:06.623
Is this a crashed Meteosat?

20:58.884 --> 20:59.885
Don't touch that!

21:00.260 --> 21:01.637
Fuck, that's disgusting.

21:01.970 --> 21:03.931
What's... Is that a...?

21:04.515 --> 21:05.891
Are you OK, darling?
-Yes.

21:05.974 --> 21:07.059
Let me check, please.

21:07.142 --> 21:08.769
Let me check your finger!
-Stop!

21:09.061 --> 21:09.895
I'm fine.

21:10.187 --> 21:11.813
Don't be a pest.
-Marta!

21:12.523 --> 21:13.690
Marta, come on!

21:35.462 --> 21:36.588
You're staying there.

21:38.173 --> 21:41.343
If this belongs to the government,
it's best not to touch it!

21:42.010 --> 21:43.053
Come on! Let's go!

22:09.162 --> 22:11.748
Holy shit, what did we just witness?

22:12.332 --> 22:13.458
Did you see?

22:13.792 --> 22:14.626
I bet...

22:15.252 --> 22:17.671
I bet it's what the guys saw
in the village.

22:17.754 --> 22:18.797
Fuck.

22:19.548 --> 22:23.510
There have always been
strange sightings in this area.

22:30.767 --> 22:31.602
Oh... God.

22:40.235 --> 22:43.155
-You're going to see the miracle-worker?
-What?

22:44.072 --> 22:45.490
Your hair...

22:51.121 --> 22:52.080
Oh, God...

22:56.543 --> 22:58.253
It crashed or it was brought down.

22:58.337 --> 23:00.631
That's the target of the next World War.

23:00.714 --> 23:02.382
Telecommunications.

23:03.300 --> 23:06.553
Did you read that
or is that a theory of yours?

23:06.637 --> 23:08.263
No, child. Don't be naive.

23:09.723 --> 23:11.475
They spy on us 24/7.

23:11.558 --> 23:12.976
24/7.

23:13.393 --> 23:16.104
Why do you think I have an old phone?

23:16.188 --> 23:19.274
They'll never catch me.
-It's not because you're stingy, yeah?

23:20.234 --> 23:21.443
Oh... little girl.

23:21.527 --> 23:25.113
Your fancy device,
Japanese, Chinese, or from wherever,

23:25.197 --> 23:28.367
is always listening
and recording everything you say.

23:28.450 --> 23:29.409
Test it.

23:29.868 --> 23:32.079
Let's talk about any subject,
and in no time,

23:32.162 --> 23:35.666
you'll start receiving notifications,
ads...

23:35.749 --> 23:37.584
You'll see.
Test it!

23:38.293 --> 23:39.795
-Come on!
-I will.

23:39.878 --> 23:42.756
-Try it! Come on.
-Let's see...

23:44.466 --> 23:45.467
Is it bad?

23:49.721 --> 23:51.890
It's spread everywhere, but...

23:54.059 --> 23:56.812
I don't like telling people.
Not even my family knows.

24:05.320 --> 24:07.656
I don't like pity.
Don't tell anyone.

24:08.490 --> 24:11.118
No.
I won't. Relax.

24:17.457 --> 24:18.375
No.

24:18.458 --> 24:21.503
Your theory doesn't hold up.
-What do you mean?

24:21.587 --> 24:22.963
How come?

24:25.007 --> 24:27.426
I'm not getting pasodobles on Spotify.

24:28.969 --> 24:30.804
You're so annoying.

24:34.224 --> 24:36.351
Stop biting your nails!

24:36.435 --> 24:38.729
You're bleeding.
Your mother will see you.

24:57.331 --> 24:58.582
Oh, no way...

25:04.296 --> 25:06.507
I think Nessa needs some love.

25:06.590 --> 25:09.468
-How do you fix it?
-It doesn't get fixed.

25:10.719 --> 25:12.012
It's up to Nessa.

25:17.309 --> 25:19.478
It's just about the Virgin.

25:20.729 --> 25:22.856
I don't doubt her kindness.

25:24.399 --> 25:27.110
But I doubt
she'll make an exception for me.

25:27.903 --> 25:29.404
I've seen many people...

25:29.488 --> 25:31.740
Because I've taken care of them.
Many, many...

25:32.407 --> 25:33.909
And I've seen them pass away,

25:34.451 --> 25:36.828
people healthier than me,
with no chance at all.

25:36.912 --> 25:37.829
Just like that.

25:38.330 --> 25:39.373
Are you a nurse?

25:41.333 --> 25:43.293
Well, I like calling myself carer.

25:43.377 --> 25:45.295
But people like calling me nurse.

25:45.379 --> 25:46.380
So...

25:54.471 --> 25:58.600
So, when I started feeling awful,
I never expected

25:58.684 --> 26:01.770
this would get ugly,
that it would get serious, and...

26:05.232 --> 26:07.025
Paths are inscrutable.

26:08.318 --> 26:09.695
I'm truly sorry.

26:09.778 --> 26:11.238
Don't worry, I'm fine.

26:12.906 --> 26:14.491
I've come to terms with it.

26:15.117 --> 26:17.870
I just want to get
to Valgarde to see my dad.

26:20.873 --> 26:24.710
He made my mum suffer so much,
and I can't understand that.

26:26.170 --> 26:28.338
I hope I'll see forgiveness there.

26:29.173 --> 26:30.007
Damn.

26:30.841 --> 26:33.385
Picture it...
Plucking up the courage.

26:34.720 --> 26:38.307
-Does he know you're coming?
-No. Not at all.

26:39.141 --> 26:43.020
No, he left when I was little.

26:43.645 --> 26:46.023
And... we never heard of him again.

26:46.899 --> 26:47.941
Lazy prick.

26:49.526 --> 26:51.236
I want to see his face because...

26:51.320 --> 26:53.488
I look just like my mum
when she was my age.

27:00.412 --> 27:05.375
-You're going to see your ex, right?
-Yes.

27:07.169 --> 27:09.087
Do you get along?

27:09.713 --> 27:11.256
Yes.
Well, it's cordial.

27:12.174 --> 27:14.510
I don't have your courage to forgive.

27:15.594 --> 27:18.680
Especially when he's left
an everlasting mark on our daughter.

27:19.598 --> 27:23.227
In the face of something so sacred
as that bull, you must cross yourself.

27:25.229 --> 27:28.732
Whether people like it or not,
it is, it was and it will continue to be

27:28.815 --> 27:30.359
a symbol of Spanish culture.

27:31.109 --> 27:32.402
We have to show respect.

27:32.486 --> 27:33.570
Come on, do it.

27:34.321 --> 27:35.948
Or else it's bad luck, child.

27:36.448 --> 27:38.116
It's bad luck for the poor animal

27:38.200 --> 27:40.285
that comes into this world
to be tortured.

27:40.369 --> 27:43.247
Not the same old story.
Oh my God.

27:43.330 --> 27:46.333
Look! Look who's come back
to prove me right.

27:48.502 --> 27:51.922
She was five and he...

27:52.923 --> 27:55.384
He had too much alcohol
in his system to drive.

27:57.177 --> 27:58.720
But it could have been worse.

28:00.389 --> 28:03.225
She survived,
despite the burns.

28:04.852 --> 28:08.105
After the accident, they thought
she'd never walk again, and look.

28:09.523 --> 28:13.402
Kids are cut from a different cloth.
They're tougher than their parents.

28:13.902 --> 28:15.612
No, not all kids. Your girl.

28:15.696 --> 28:18.115
You can tell she's resilient.

28:18.907 --> 28:21.910
-And I'm too overprotective, right?
-No, I never said that.

28:22.369 --> 28:23.579
But it's true.

28:25.330 --> 28:26.582
Kids are cruel

28:26.665 --> 28:29.001
and I can't stand the idea
of her getting hurt.

28:30.377 --> 28:31.712
Yet here I am,

28:33.213 --> 28:36.508
separating her from her world
to go to work to London.

28:36.592 --> 28:39.052
There's nothing wrong in that.
It's your right.

28:39.136 --> 28:40.429
It's ten months.

28:40.971 --> 28:43.891
And it's a good opportunity for me.
-Of course.

28:43.974 --> 28:46.226
For her too,
because she'll see her dad.

28:49.104 --> 28:52.191
Ultimately, your daughter and I
are going for the same reason.

28:57.112 --> 28:57.946
Cheer up.

28:59.031 --> 29:01.241
It's this pasodoble,
it brings back memories.

29:06.663 --> 29:09.208
Damn, don't tell me
you haven't heard this one.

29:09.291 --> 29:12.002
What the fuck
do they teach you at school?

29:12.085 --> 29:14.671
It's one of my favourites. Damn!

29:14.755 --> 29:17.049
It's even more famous than Rafa Nadal.

29:17.132 --> 29:18.800
Imagine it on an electric guitar.

29:18.884 --> 29:21.011
When I play this,
it sounds...

29:21.094 --> 29:23.472
It sounds like punk, you know?
It's amazing.

29:23.555 --> 29:25.891
No way.
Are you a jack-of-all-trades?

29:25.974 --> 29:31.146
Can you play the guitar?
-Can I? You must be kidding, child.

29:31.480 --> 29:34.149
Jesus.
In the 80s I was in a band

29:34.233 --> 29:38.111
that was massive.
The One-Eyed Living Dead.

29:39.988 --> 29:43.700
I sang, played the guitar...
I fucking owned the stage, you know?

29:44.701 --> 29:46.662
Had you known me back then,

29:46.745 --> 29:48.288
you would have fallen for me.

29:48.914 --> 29:51.959
All the girls back then fell for me.

29:52.793 --> 29:55.420
Oh Lord.
-Yes, because now as a chauffeur

29:55.504 --> 29:57.464
no one fancies you, to be honest.

29:57.548 --> 30:01.260
Fuck... you're such a wind-up-merchant.

30:01.969 --> 30:04.930
This is temporary, yeah?
Until I get bored of it.

30:06.557 --> 30:08.976
I don't get tied down
for anything or anyone.

30:09.059 --> 30:12.229
I'm a natural survivor.

30:12.938 --> 30:15.649
Not this shit again.
What now?

30:21.655 --> 30:22.489
Hey.

30:23.240 --> 30:24.074
What's wrong?

30:24.658 --> 30:27.160
Child! Child!
Marta! Marta!

30:27.244 --> 30:30.122
Madam, something's wrong
with her, she's all stiff.

30:30.205 --> 30:32.541
Marta! Marta! What's wrong?

30:32.624 --> 30:35.252
Marta! Marta, it's me, your mum!
Marta!

30:35.335 --> 30:36.879
-Marta!
-Child! Child!

30:37.838 --> 30:38.964
What's wrong?
-Careful!

30:39.047 --> 30:40.132
Fuck me!

30:47.556 --> 30:50.601
Fuck! What was that?
-You hit someone! Turn around.

30:50.684 --> 30:53.645
-No, what do you mean?
-You hit someone, go back!

30:53.729 --> 30:54.605
No way!

30:55.814 --> 30:57.733
Madam, sort your daughter out!
-Marta!

30:58.233 --> 30:59.943
Marta, please! Marta!

31:00.027 --> 31:01.987
It couldn't have been
someone on the road.

31:02.070 --> 31:05.157
If you don't go back,
it's failure of duty to rescue. Go back!

31:05.240 --> 31:07.743
Marta! That's it, darling.
Stop the car!

31:07.826 --> 31:10.120
Last warning,
go back or I'll report you!

31:10.204 --> 31:13.415
-Marta, look at me!
-For fuck's sake! Wretch!

31:13.498 --> 31:15.250
Turn around, you scumbag!

31:15.334 --> 31:18.879
-Breathe with me.
-Fuck my life!

31:21.507 --> 31:22.341
Hurry!

31:36.939 --> 31:38.065
I can't see a thing.

31:38.649 --> 31:39.816
Use your headlights.

31:39.900 --> 31:43.237
I know, I know.
Less orders, sergeant.

31:46.198 --> 31:48.075
There! There!

31:58.710 --> 32:02.005
Damn! What the fuck is this?
Fuck my life.

32:03.799 --> 32:05.467
Please tell she isn't dead.

32:05.551 --> 32:08.512
She's breathing.
She has a pulse, but she's freezing.

32:08.595 --> 32:10.681
-Is she OK?
-Get help, please!

32:10.764 --> 32:12.850
-I'm calling for help.
-What was she doing

32:12.933 --> 32:15.727
walking on the middle
of the road at this time? Fuck!

32:16.812 --> 32:18.105
What?

32:18.188 --> 32:20.274
What was that?
Please, you call.

32:20.357 --> 32:22.109
-Want me to call?
-Please call, yes!

32:22.484 --> 32:24.403
I'll call.
But you've all witnessed it.

32:24.486 --> 32:27.906
It was an accident. It wasn't my fault.
OK? It wasn't me.

32:27.990 --> 32:28.907
OK.

32:33.704 --> 32:36.540
Bloody hell!
Fucking shitty technology!

32:37.082 --> 32:39.001
-Do you have bandages?
-What?

32:39.084 --> 32:41.003
-Do you have bandages, yes or no?
-Yes.

32:41.086 --> 32:43.839
-Fetch them!
-Hurry!

32:45.382 --> 32:46.717
Fuck...

32:57.728 --> 32:58.854
Can you hear me?

32:58.937 --> 33:01.148
She doesn't understand.
She looks foreign.

33:03.358 --> 33:05.360
-Come on!
-Coming!

33:06.653 --> 33:09.198
Fuck my life. Take.
There you go.

33:09.781 --> 33:12.034
-We have to take her to the hospital.
-No way.

33:12.117 --> 33:14.244
No fucking way.
She won't die in Nessa.

33:14.328 --> 33:17.122
-What are you on about?
-What I'm on about?

33:17.706 --> 33:19.750
You can't move someone who's been hit.

33:19.833 --> 33:22.544
Everyone says that.
We'll go ahead and look for help.

33:22.628 --> 33:23.837
You're heartless.

33:23.921 --> 33:26.757
Heartless?
We'll fuck up if we move her.

33:26.840 --> 33:28.759
-Shut up already!
-Eh?

33:28.842 --> 33:29.968
Please!

33:30.385 --> 33:32.971
I need help, come here.
You too.

33:33.055 --> 33:35.182
She's a nurse.
We're in good hands.

33:35.265 --> 33:37.267
-A nurse?
-Listen to me!

33:39.895 --> 33:43.148
Let's move her, but keep her straight.

33:43.232 --> 33:44.858
On the count of three, lift.

33:45.400 --> 33:48.278
Keep her straight, OK?
One, two, three!

33:52.074 --> 33:54.493
There's a first-aid post
30 kilometres from here!

33:54.576 --> 33:57.996
Take the next exit!
-There's a hospital in Valgarde!

33:58.080 --> 34:00.082
-What?
-What's your name?

34:04.169 --> 34:07.548
I don't know that road, madam!
And those maps are old as fuck.

34:10.092 --> 34:12.010
I'm sure that post is no longer there.

34:12.094 --> 34:14.137
She's not well,
we have to take the risk!

34:14.221 --> 34:15.556
My car, my rules!

34:20.726 --> 34:21.687
What are you doing?

34:21.770 --> 34:23.230
I'm going to the hospital,

34:23.313 --> 34:25.774
which is where she belongs.
That's what I'm doing.

34:35.492 --> 34:39.329
First, you didn't want to turn around.
And now you fail to get help.

34:39.413 --> 34:42.373
Can you tell me
what kind of monster are you?

34:45.960 --> 34:46.962
Poor thing.

34:47.045 --> 34:50.424
If you say so, madam.
You made it perfectly clear before.

34:50.841 --> 34:53.217
A scumbag with no heart.
A caveman.

34:53.302 --> 34:56.138
-Yes, that's what you are.
-This fucking witch

34:56.221 --> 34:57.723
must be right then.
-Hey!

34:57.806 --> 35:00.684
Listen to me,
you think I have no heart?

35:00.767 --> 35:03.812
-No.
-Who fucking has one?

35:03.896 --> 35:05.022
Do you have one?

35:07.107 --> 35:08.275
Poor thing...

35:19.286 --> 35:22.581
This is the shitty world we live in,
where some strangers

35:22.664 --> 35:26.168
have to share a ride
because we're poor as fuck!

35:28.754 --> 35:30.714
Where everything
is in fucking shambles!

35:30.797 --> 35:32.466
Speak for yourself.

35:32.549 --> 35:34.927
I can't take it anymore, madam!
I can't take it!

35:36.428 --> 35:37.804
Just look behind you.

35:42.684 --> 35:45.979
And I still can't understand
why the woman I've loved the most

35:46.063 --> 35:48.815
left me after giving birth
to my stillborn son.

35:49.399 --> 35:51.568
You need to seek professional help.

35:51.652 --> 35:52.903
The sooner, the better.

35:52.986 --> 35:56.365
You can't justify your chauvinist
and backward behaviour!

35:56.448 --> 35:59.451
You can't justify it all the time!
You can't!

35:59.535 --> 36:01.370
I just want to get to the hospital

36:01.453 --> 36:04.122
and not be blamed for anything.
That's all I want.

36:14.716 --> 36:15.926
Are you done?

36:16.927 --> 36:18.846
Or do you need tissues for your tears?

36:19.680 --> 36:22.140
I have one right here.
-Mum, shut up!

36:24.518 --> 36:27.479
-Marta!
-Leave him alone, you don't know him!

36:27.563 --> 36:31.358
Marta, enough!
I won't let you speak to me like that.

36:31.441 --> 36:32.818
Marta!

36:33.360 --> 36:35.445
Marta! Turn the volume down!

36:35.529 --> 36:36.738
Enough!

36:41.410 --> 36:42.786
Turn the music down, Marta!

36:44.037 --> 36:44.997
Marta!

37:37.424 --> 37:38.759
I'm getting some signal.

37:40.469 --> 37:42.179
I'll call for help!

37:43.138 --> 37:45.057
How are you doing back there, Mariela?

38:06.411 --> 38:08.747
Do you want to know
how I actually lost my eye?

38:11.458 --> 38:12.292
Yes.

38:16.547 --> 38:17.506
We had no clue

38:17.589 --> 38:19.800
that the pricks
from the village next to ours

38:19.883 --> 38:21.009
came with slingshots.

38:40.112 --> 38:42.948
Mum! Mum!

38:43.031 --> 38:46.660
We have to help her!
Come on! Come on!

38:47.119 --> 38:48.036
Mum!

38:50.747 --> 38:53.041
-What the fuck is that?
-Mum!

38:55.627 --> 38:57.880
Mum!

39:00.465 --> 39:03.886
Mum!

39:48.305 --> 39:49.848
Die, you son of a bitch!

39:49.932 --> 39:52.601
Run, run!

39:52.684 --> 39:55.395
Run, run,
get your daughter.

39:55.479 --> 39:59.233
Come here, run,
get your daughter.

40:14.831 --> 40:15.666
Run!

40:16.750 --> 40:20.671
-Run, Marta.
-Run!

40:29.805 --> 40:31.056
Will it hold?

40:32.140 --> 40:35.269
Nessa is strong,
but I wouldn't stay to test that.

40:42.985 --> 40:43.861
Fuck!

40:44.194 --> 40:45.737
Let's get out of here.

40:59.209 --> 41:01.670
To hell with that fucking mariachi.

41:01.753 --> 41:04.173
Can you believe what she did to Nessa?
My Nessa!

41:04.256 --> 41:05.799
That wasn't Mariela.

41:06.758 --> 41:08.427
She has cancer.
-Huh?

41:08.510 --> 41:11.388
Perhaps the thing inside her
won't survive the disease.

41:16.727 --> 41:18.020
We have to split up.

41:18.854 --> 41:20.898
That's best,
we have to split up, OK?

41:21.398 --> 41:24.067
In case this shit can multiply,
you know?

41:24.735 --> 41:25.611
OK?

41:26.028 --> 41:27.946
No, Blasco,

41:28.197 --> 41:30.365
don't leave us.
-Relax, kiddo.

41:30.449 --> 41:33.994
Relax. Trust me, OK?
This is best for you both.

41:34.620 --> 41:37.039
Besides, I smashed its head
with my guitar

41:37.122 --> 41:39.750
and said all the crap about women;
it'll go after me.

41:39.833 --> 41:41.668
Go on.

41:42.336 --> 41:44.963
You're right, we have to split up.

41:45.214 --> 41:47.966
Of course.
Blasco is always right.

41:48.842 --> 41:50.385
Go on. Hey, you.

41:51.803 --> 41:53.680
Here, just in case.

41:57.434 --> 41:58.268
Not so bad, huh?

42:00.437 --> 42:01.813
-Let's go.
-Hey.

42:01.897 --> 42:03.440
Let's go.

42:07.486 --> 42:09.238
-It hurts.
-Is it your finger?

42:09.655 --> 42:10.489
Let me see.

42:57.536 --> 42:58.370
Come on.

43:00.163 --> 43:01.164
What's wrong, dear?

43:02.082 --> 43:04.751
Get it off me, get it off me.

43:05.335 --> 43:06.378
Get it off me.

43:07.087 --> 43:08.922
Get it off me! Get it off me!

43:42.915 --> 43:46.460
My child. Hold on, love.
Hold on.

43:46.543 --> 43:47.753
Hold on, please.

43:58.889 --> 43:59.723
Marta.

44:00.432 --> 44:01.266
Marta.

45:11.128 --> 45:11.962
Mum.

45:12.963 --> 45:16.258
Mum, Mum, hurry.
We have to go.

45:16.341 --> 45:17.801
Mum.

45:20.637 --> 45:22.181
We have to split up.

45:25.267 --> 45:26.476
What the hell?

45:26.560 --> 45:30.606
If we stick together,
it will eventually catch up.

45:31.857 --> 45:36.069
Seek a road,
find someone, I'll stay here,

45:36.153 --> 45:37.905
I'll keep it distracted.
-No!

45:39.031 --> 45:40.824
I want to stay with you.

45:42.451 --> 45:46.663
What I said before wasn't true.

45:47.664 --> 45:49.416
Don't leave me alone.

45:50.751 --> 45:51.835
I love you so much.

45:52.586 --> 45:54.922
I know, dear,
I love you too.

45:55.380 --> 45:58.759
That's why I need you
to listen to me, dear,

45:58.842 --> 46:01.970
for us to survive.
-No!

46:04.681 --> 46:06.391
Promise you'll make it out.

46:07.935 --> 46:09.520
I'll do my best to make it out.

46:11.230 --> 46:12.898
Please, hurry.
-No.

46:12.981 --> 46:16.443
-Seek a road, go, please.
-No!

46:38.048 --> 46:38.966
Mum!

48:05.093 --> 48:06.220
That hurt.

48:07.554 --> 48:08.514
That hurt.

48:09.890 --> 48:12.935
Do you have a plaster?
I smashed my skull in.

48:13.936 --> 48:14.811
Where's your mum?

48:16.104 --> 48:17.856
-Blasco!
-It's OK.

48:18.524 --> 48:20.317
Kiddo, what's wrong?

48:20.776 --> 48:23.529
Hey, relax. Let's move.
-Run.

48:23.612 --> 48:24.821
-Let's go.
-Run.

48:42.172 --> 48:43.215
Run.

48:43.298 --> 48:44.633
Run, let's go.

48:45.092 --> 48:46.969
Come on, go. Run.

48:49.555 --> 48:52.391
-Mum...
-Let's leave! Let's get out of here.

48:52.474 --> 48:54.434
-No, no.
-It's too late.

48:54.768 --> 48:58.105
We can't do anything.
Your mum knew she wouldn't make it out.

48:58.188 --> 48:59.523
Understand that, please.

49:00.691 --> 49:03.193
This is fucked up, let's go!
Let's leave now!

49:03.277 --> 49:05.779
No, let me go.
You're clueless.

49:05.863 --> 49:07.614
Leave me alone. Leave!

49:26.842 --> 49:28.135
Please, child.

49:29.845 --> 49:31.555
I'm begging you, get in!

49:34.057 --> 49:34.975
Child!

50:01.168 --> 50:02.169
Fuck, fuck!

50:04.129 --> 50:05.881
What happened to your finger?

50:11.720 --> 50:13.388
It gets inside you.

50:13.472 --> 50:14.765
What does?

50:16.350 --> 50:17.184
That thing does.

50:18.810 --> 50:21.980
It gets inside your body
to live inside you like a...

50:22.397 --> 50:23.524
I don't know.

50:25.192 --> 50:27.194
Like a parasite?
Is that what you mean?

50:28.362 --> 50:29.363
A parasite.

50:30.030 --> 50:32.366
Fuck, I have absolutely no doubt then.

50:34.034 --> 50:36.453
What we saw back there was a UFO.

50:36.995 --> 50:39.456
Fucking invaders
that want to take over our bodies

50:39.540 --> 50:40.749
and minds to control us.

50:43.043 --> 50:46.088
You're absolutely right,
just like in films!

50:46.880 --> 50:49.591
That's what happened,
that fucking creature

50:49.675 --> 50:53.804
got inside the Mexican lady's body
and ate her guts...

50:54.721 --> 50:56.390
Shut up, Blasco.

50:57.933 --> 51:00.477
Don't cry, don't cry, kiddo.

51:01.395 --> 51:03.105
Everything will be OK.

51:03.188 --> 51:04.106
Trust me.

51:12.072 --> 51:13.949
Fuck, cry then.

51:14.825 --> 51:18.620
If that relieves you, that'll do good.
Cry your eyes out.

51:26.086 --> 51:27.212
You know what?

51:28.922 --> 51:31.842
Your mum
is the bravest person I've ever met.

51:31.925 --> 51:33.135
That's right.

51:34.845 --> 51:37.347
You would've done the same
if I were your daughter.

51:38.849 --> 51:40.642
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

51:41.560 --> 51:43.896
You saw how I fled.

51:44.479 --> 51:45.522
But you came back.

51:46.064 --> 51:48.275
Right, because
it was going to fuck up Nessa.

51:49.568 --> 51:51.737
And you didn't leave me behind.

51:54.823 --> 51:56.783
All right then, I kind of agree.

51:57.451 --> 52:00.078
That doesn't take away credit
from what your mum did.

52:05.626 --> 52:07.669
Can you put some music on?

52:08.712 --> 52:10.506
I've lost my phone.

52:10.589 --> 52:12.466
As you wish, boss.

52:12.925 --> 52:15.093
All right, Nessa, come on.

52:29.691 --> 52:30.943
Come on, Nessa,

52:31.610 --> 52:32.694
hold on.

52:33.862 --> 52:35.614
Hold on just a bit longer.

53:10.858 --> 53:12.568
Hey, quit that.

53:13.193 --> 53:14.820
I see you with my good eye.

53:15.362 --> 53:18.782
I know what you're thinking,
but this place is empty, as you can see.

53:19.283 --> 53:23.078
We're going straight
to the petrol station, Nessa needs fuel.

53:23.161 --> 53:26.206
-We need to get help.
-Right, but trust me.

53:27.749 --> 53:31.044
I know the manager,
he's a nice guy.

53:31.128 --> 53:33.172
Besides, I always stop there

53:33.255 --> 53:35.799
when my passengers need to pee.

53:36.508 --> 53:38.135
Will he call the police?

53:38.218 --> 53:42.723
Police...? The Spanish Legion,
with their goat and all.

53:43.390 --> 53:47.477
We have to get rid of that creature,
fuck, at all costs.

53:48.812 --> 53:50.814
Blasco, what's that smell?

53:51.231 --> 53:52.232
It smells like piss.

53:52.733 --> 53:53.609
Like piss?

54:01.491 --> 54:03.994
It must be this crap on the screen,

54:04.411 --> 54:05.454
I guess.

54:06.580 --> 54:09.666
Look, child! There it is, come on!

54:10.334 --> 54:12.628
Fuck, what Blasco says, goes.

54:15.923 --> 54:16.757
Nessa.

54:17.508 --> 54:18.383
Blasco?

54:19.426 --> 54:20.677
Fuck, Nessa.

54:21.845 --> 54:22.721
Fuck.

54:23.388 --> 54:24.806
Blasco, what's wrong?

54:26.183 --> 54:27.100
Blasco.

54:27.184 --> 54:29.436
-What?
-We're going backwards.

54:29.520 --> 54:32.773
BLASCO
PEST CONTROL

54:32.856 --> 54:35.192
Fuck my life.

54:36.193 --> 54:37.361
Come on, child.
Push.

54:38.028 --> 54:39.988
Nessa is so fucking heavy.

54:42.366 --> 54:45.452
Come on, nearly.
Come on, child, go.

54:45.827 --> 54:47.579
Now, all the way up.

54:50.332 --> 54:52.459
You should quit smoking and join a gym.

54:52.543 --> 54:55.546
I've joined one,
now all I have to do is go.

54:55.963 --> 54:57.005
Damn.

55:06.807 --> 55:09.768
Damn, Nessa, don't tell me
you're on your period again.

55:10.477 --> 55:11.979
I thought you were menopausal.

55:12.521 --> 55:15.023
-What did you say?
-Nothing, nothing at all, child.

55:15.440 --> 55:17.526
This isn't an issue,
it's nothing serious.

55:19.444 --> 55:21.697
Relax, I can patch this up.

55:22.573 --> 55:23.991
Bloody hell.

55:32.207 --> 55:33.458
No fucking way.

55:33.542 --> 55:35.669
BACK IN 5

55:35.752 --> 55:38.213
For fuck's sake.
-What is it?

55:38.839 --> 55:40.841
He's not here.

55:42.176 --> 55:45.179
-But he's back in five minutes, yeah?
-Five minutes, my ass.

55:45.262 --> 55:47.097
I know this guy.

55:47.181 --> 55:49.975
And nobody's ever on this road.

55:51.143 --> 55:53.145
Hey, look at me, relax.

55:53.228 --> 55:57.524
Relax. Hey, Marta, look at me.
Look at me. Breathe. Take a deep breath.

55:57.608 --> 55:59.193
Take a deep breath.

55:59.693 --> 56:02.112
Take a deep breath, slowly, that's is.

56:03.405 --> 56:04.448
Again.

56:07.117 --> 56:09.620
I'm not going anywhere.

56:09.703 --> 56:11.955
I'm here with you
and I'm not leaving you, OK?

56:12.247 --> 56:13.123
OK?
-OK.

56:13.207 --> 56:14.708
-You believe me, yeah?
-Yeah.

56:14.791 --> 56:16.376
Come here, my princess.

56:17.794 --> 56:19.087
Blasco has a plan.

56:23.967 --> 56:26.345
Let me see, my child.

56:26.845 --> 56:29.306
The fifth passenger
has caused such a mess, Nessa.

56:29.973 --> 56:31.350
No shit.

56:31.642 --> 56:34.645
As I mentioned,
I'll get petrol from the village, OK?

56:39.566 --> 56:43.320
Well, my child, I'm leaving.
Be quiet and lock the doors.

56:43.403 --> 56:46.698
Don't open it for anyone,
not even for your singer friend,

56:46.782 --> 56:50.244
the one from Cuenca, Diazepam...?
-Dua Lipa.

56:50.827 --> 56:51.703
Whatever.

56:52.538 --> 56:56.208
-What if Máximo returns?
-If Maxi returns, he knows Nessa.

56:56.291 --> 56:59.628
He'll come and say hi, for sure.
Tell him what's going on.

57:00.045 --> 57:02.840
To him to fill her up
and find somewhere safe to hide

57:02.923 --> 57:05.092
until I get back, OK?
-OK.

57:06.635 --> 57:09.513
Anyway, lock the doors,
lights off and be quiet.

57:10.931 --> 57:11.765
Great.

57:12.683 --> 57:14.226
-Blasco.
-Yes?

57:15.269 --> 57:16.270
Will you come back?

57:18.272 --> 57:21.191
I'd never abandon
my two favourite girls.

57:24.152 --> 57:25.946
All right, take care of my girl.

57:26.572 --> 57:27.406
OK.

57:28.907 --> 57:30.075
I was talking to Nessa.

57:32.327 --> 57:33.745
You're such a pain.

59:57.598 --> 59:59.975
Hi, madam.
I'm back.

1:00:00.517 --> 1:00:01.435
I'm sorry.

1:00:43.894 --> 1:00:45.229
What is it, little thing?

1:00:45.312 --> 1:00:48.357
Come here, come to daddy.

1:00:48.690 --> 1:00:52.778
What is it, my little thing?
Where are you going? What?

1:00:53.904 --> 1:00:54.905
Fuck!

1:02:24.286 --> 1:02:25.454
Child.

1:02:25.829 --> 1:02:29.875
Come here, come.
What's wrong?

1:02:30.667 --> 1:02:33.086
-What happened?
-It was here. It was here.

1:02:33.170 --> 1:02:35.255
-What was here?
-My mum.

1:02:38.592 --> 1:02:39.885
Marta, what do you mean?

1:02:39.968 --> 1:02:43.222
We have to leave.
Blasco, we have to leave at once.

1:02:43.305 --> 1:02:45.015
Come on, hurry.
Hurry, run!

1:02:45.098 --> 1:02:46.767
Come on, let's go!

1:03:02.658 --> 1:03:03.575
Fucking hell.

1:03:17.297 --> 1:03:18.507
What now?

1:03:20.509 --> 1:03:21.343
Nothing.

1:03:25.264 --> 1:03:27.015
And where...

1:03:27.099 --> 1:03:29.059
where did you get petrol from?

1:03:29.685 --> 1:03:30.644
The village.

1:03:32.563 --> 1:03:33.814
I took some out of a car.

1:03:39.695 --> 1:03:40.946
What's your band called?

1:03:41.029 --> 1:03:41.989
What?

1:03:43.115 --> 1:03:45.075
The heavy metal one,
what was it called?

1:03:46.034 --> 1:03:48.036
What's this fucking interrogation about?

1:03:48.120 --> 1:03:49.288
Answer!

1:03:53.166 --> 1:03:54.751
Firstly, it wasn't heavy metal,

1:03:54.835 --> 1:03:57.671
it was kalimotxero rock,
which is quite different.

1:03:58.797 --> 1:04:01.633
It was the One-Eyed Living Dead.
There's a sticker there.

1:04:02.467 --> 1:04:03.385
ONE-EYED LIVING DEAD

1:04:03.468 --> 1:04:05.971
Is that enough?
Any more questions?

1:04:07.347 --> 1:04:10.058
Are you convinced
I have no fucking parasite inside me?

1:04:10.809 --> 1:04:11.643
Fuck.

1:04:15.397 --> 1:04:16.398
I'm sorry.

1:04:18.400 --> 1:04:19.443
Oh, you did...

1:04:20.277 --> 1:04:21.945
You did amazing, child.

1:04:22.279 --> 1:04:23.280
Fucking amazing.

1:04:24.114 --> 1:04:25.949
We don't even know what that is.

1:04:26.491 --> 1:04:28.118
We don't know if there are more.

1:04:28.410 --> 1:04:30.120
I'm fucking thirsty.
-Let me see,

1:04:30.954 --> 1:04:32.623
come here,
let me plug your wound.

1:04:35.042 --> 1:04:36.585
Are you a nurse now?

1:04:38.504 --> 1:04:41.173
-Take your hat off, please.
-I'm not sure...

1:04:42.716 --> 1:04:43.592
Let me see...

1:04:45.385 --> 1:04:46.637
All done.

1:04:46.720 --> 1:04:48.514
Thank goodness you have a big head.

1:04:48.889 --> 1:04:49.765
Excuse me?

1:04:51.558 --> 1:04:54.144
A chauvinist, a caveman...
-And A big head.

1:04:54.228 --> 1:04:57.314
And a big head. Fuck.

1:04:58.023 --> 1:04:59.733
As if we didn't have enough!

1:05:02.611 --> 1:05:04.696
When it rains,

1:05:06.490 --> 1:05:07.783
it pours.

1:05:08.325 --> 1:05:11.245
Go on, dry up, Nessa.

1:05:15.541 --> 1:05:16.375
No.

1:05:19.837 --> 1:05:21.338
-It's here!
-It's here.

1:05:21.421 --> 1:05:22.506
No!

1:05:25.634 --> 1:05:26.593
Hold on.

1:05:26.677 --> 1:05:30.639
Fuck, hold on.
Let go, it's OK.

1:05:30.722 --> 1:05:32.057
OK, let's go.

1:05:42.109 --> 1:05:43.402
I have you now,

1:05:43.944 --> 1:05:45.946
whore.
Hold tight!

1:05:58.166 --> 1:05:59.293
Take that!

1:06:34.453 --> 1:06:36.580
It's over, my child. It's over.

1:06:38.415 --> 1:06:40.709
It's all over, OK?

1:06:41.168 --> 1:06:42.127
Are you OK?

1:07:00.437 --> 1:07:01.939
Have you heard this one?

1:07:09.905 --> 1:07:10.739
Of course.

1:07:11.740 --> 1:07:13.784
It's Pepito el Chocolatero, right?

1:07:18.830 --> 1:07:20.082
What's so funny?

1:07:22.084 --> 1:07:24.545
It's Paquito, Paquito el Chocolatero.

1:07:26.213 --> 1:07:30.759
Pepito is Dua Lipa's cousin,
you know, the one from Cuenca.

1:08:13.302 --> 1:08:16.345
My head's killing me and I'm so thirsty.

1:08:18.348 --> 1:08:21.059
Blasco,
Blasco, what's wrong?

1:08:21.143 --> 1:08:22.685
Nothing, relax.

1:08:22.769 --> 1:08:24.188
It might be a good idea

1:08:24.270 --> 1:08:28.358
to have a safe word.

1:08:29.484 --> 1:08:32.196
Just in case.
In case we split up.

1:08:38.535 --> 1:08:41.872
What about... "pasodoble"?

1:08:42.956 --> 1:08:45.292
That's getting old.
You're so tiresome!

1:08:46.126 --> 1:08:48.629
I'm 100 % Blasco, without a question.

1:08:55.051 --> 1:08:59.180
-Blasco, what's wrong?
-I feel dizzy, do you have water?

1:09:01.058 --> 1:09:02.935
I think Mariela had some in the back.

1:09:07.439 --> 1:09:08.899
-I need water.
-We have none.

1:09:10.067 --> 1:09:10.901
Blasco.

1:09:13.319 --> 1:09:14.154
Blasco.

1:09:14.904 --> 1:09:17.032
Blasco. Blasco!

1:09:17.115 --> 1:09:18.075
Wake up.

1:09:18.617 --> 1:09:20.410
What's wrong?

1:09:21.537 --> 1:09:22.537
Your mum.

1:09:23.162 --> 1:09:24.915
Your mum's back.

1:09:38.595 --> 1:09:41.682
Blasco! Blasco! Blasco!

1:12:40.194 --> 1:12:42.404
Blasco! Blasco!

1:12:44.364 --> 1:12:45.407
Blasco!

1:12:45.908 --> 1:12:48.702
Let him go! Let him go!

1:12:48.785 --> 1:12:50.913
No, no!

1:12:51.663 --> 1:12:55.125
No, Blasco, no!

1:12:55.209 --> 1:12:56.168
Blasco.

1:13:02.007 --> 1:13:03.091
Come on.

1:13:04.510 --> 1:13:06.512
Come on, come on.

1:13:07.179 --> 1:13:08.180
Come on, come on.

1:13:11.308 --> 1:13:12.809
Ready!

1:13:21.527 --> 1:13:23.195
It's OK.

1:13:24.613 --> 1:13:25.447
Drink.

1:13:31.078 --> 1:13:31.954
Are you OK?

1:13:57.062 --> 1:13:59.022
Mum? Mum?

1:14:00.440 --> 1:14:02.109
It's me, it's me.

1:14:03.151 --> 1:14:04.319
Mum, I'm your daughter.

1:14:04.403 --> 1:14:05.237
It's...

1:14:07.573 --> 1:14:08.407
it's me.

1:14:12.953 --> 1:14:15.497
No, no, no!

1:14:15.581 --> 1:14:16.665
Blasco!

1:14:40.731 --> 1:14:41.565
Marta!

1:14:42.399 --> 1:14:44.109
Blasco, it won't hold!

1:14:48.238 --> 1:14:50.032
Hold on, Nessa, hold on.

1:14:55.746 --> 1:14:56.747
Fuck me!

1:14:56.830 --> 1:14:58.123
No!

1:14:58.207 --> 1:14:59.416
No!

1:15:00.167 --> 1:15:01.001
Marta!

1:15:01.752 --> 1:15:02.628
Marta!

1:15:09.635 --> 1:15:10.928
Hold on, Marta!

1:15:14.264 --> 1:15:16.266
We have to do it, Nessa.

1:15:16.350 --> 1:15:18.018
We have to save her at all costs.

1:15:18.101 --> 1:15:21.104
You've been fucking amazing,
as usual.

1:15:21.730 --> 1:15:24.483
For the last time,
it's been a pleasure.

1:15:26.485 --> 1:15:28.529
I'll drive you again
on Hell's motorways.

1:15:31.907 --> 1:15:32.866
No!

1:15:46.088 --> 1:15:47.673
Hold on, child!

1:16:07.067 --> 1:16:08.110
Marta!

1:16:09.111 --> 1:16:11.530
Child! Child!

1:16:15.284 --> 1:16:16.118
Marta.

1:16:19.204 --> 1:16:20.163
Marta!

1:16:22.875 --> 1:16:24.209
Marta. Marta!

1:16:33.427 --> 1:16:34.261
Marta.

1:16:36.847 --> 1:16:37.681
Marta.

1:16:39.850 --> 1:16:40.684
Marta.

1:16:46.481 --> 1:16:47.316
Marta.

1:16:52.196 --> 1:16:53.030
Child?

1:16:53.530 --> 1:16:54.364
Marta!

1:16:54.865 --> 1:16:55.699
Marta.

1:16:56.325 --> 1:16:57.159
Marta?

1:16:58.410 --> 1:16:59.536
Fuck, come here.

1:17:00.162 --> 1:17:04.041
Come, come, that's it.
Come here.

1:17:07.628 --> 1:17:08.754
"Pasodoble."

1:17:09.213 --> 1:17:12.299
Fuck, you scared the shit out of me.

1:17:12.925 --> 1:17:15.135
Let's get you out. Come, get out.

1:17:15.219 --> 1:17:19.014
That's it. Slowly, slowly. There we go.

1:17:19.097 --> 1:17:21.308
Up we go.
How are you?

1:17:21.391 --> 1:17:23.685
Tell me, are you OK?

1:17:23.769 --> 1:17:25.771
At least I didn't get burnt this time.

1:17:27.981 --> 1:17:28.941
Come here.

1:17:30.442 --> 1:17:32.694
Look at what this hag did to Nessa.

1:17:34.988 --> 1:17:36.740
Oh, let's go.

1:17:37.533 --> 1:17:38.742
-Blasco.
-What?

1:17:40.827 --> 1:17:43.872
I hope you're not expecting
a five-star rating on this trip.

1:17:45.374 --> 1:17:46.750
What a jackass...

1:17:46.834 --> 1:17:47.751
Let's go.

1:17:50.254 --> 1:17:51.338
No, no!

1:17:56.552 --> 1:17:58.303
No, no!

1:18:02.349 --> 1:18:03.183
Hey, you!

1:18:09.773 --> 1:18:11.817
Stop chewing her ear

1:18:12.484 --> 1:18:14.611
and come after me,
if you have the ovaries.

1:18:27.583 --> 1:18:28.417
Hey!

1:18:36.466 --> 1:18:37.926
Hey, you beast!

1:18:41.513 --> 1:18:42.347
Hey!

1:19:16.632 --> 1:19:17.466
Come on.

1:19:18.634 --> 1:19:20.219
Come on, let's go.

1:19:27.142 --> 1:19:29.603
In the end, this sword came in handy.

1:19:36.735 --> 1:19:38.612
Come on, let's go.

1:19:40.447 --> 1:19:41.281
Come on.

1:20:56.857 --> 1:20:58.358
Would you grant me this dance?

1:21:00.152 --> 1:21:03.447
I can't think of a better way
to say goodbye to Nessa.

1:21:04.781 --> 1:21:06.033
With this music?

1:21:06.909 --> 1:21:08.118
Close your eyes.

1:21:14.791 --> 1:21:15.918
Just go with the flow.

1:21:18.253 --> 1:21:21.423
This music has more passion
than all reggaeton combined.

1:21:55.207 --> 1:21:59.169
VISTA ALEGRE RESTAURANT

1:22:01.213 --> 1:22:02.673
-Blasco.
-Yes?

1:22:02.965 --> 1:22:05.717
What if that thing came
in an intergalactic ChatChat-Car

1:22:05.801 --> 1:22:07.177
and they crashed here?

1:22:07.803 --> 1:22:11.390
No, child, they came
to extinguish cavemen like me.

1:22:11.890 --> 1:22:13.308
That was much needed.

1:22:13.392 --> 1:22:14.309
Wow...

1:22:17.187 --> 1:22:20.148
Entering Vista Alegre
with a bullfighter's standing ovation.

1:22:20.232 --> 1:22:21.316
What ovation?

1:22:35.747 --> 1:22:36.582
Hello?

1:22:42.963 --> 1:22:43.797
Hey!

1:22:48.760 --> 1:22:49.720
Anyone here?

1:22:50.679 --> 1:22:51.555
Fuck.

1:22:52.639 --> 1:22:53.974
You know what?

1:22:54.725 --> 1:22:55.976
I came here to drink,

1:22:56.059 --> 1:22:58.312
and as I'm a Blasco, I'll drink.

1:22:59.354 --> 1:23:01.315
Well, I'll... go to the WC.

1:23:07.821 --> 1:23:10.115
This is an actual happy ending.

1:25:21.788 --> 1:25:22.873
Cheers!

1:25:32.883 --> 1:25:36.220
