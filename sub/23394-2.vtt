WEBVTT

00:02.461 --> 00:05.750
My name is Dr. Kreizler.
Can you tell me what you saw?

00:07.508 --> 00:08.999
Giorgio Santorelli.

00:09.134 --> 00:11.547
He's a boy-whore,
worked out of Paresis Hall.

00:11.678 --> 00:14.045
Sara. Get me the file
on the Zweig case.

00:14.181 --> 00:15.181
We need your help.

00:15.265 --> 00:17.006
The boy was a patient
of mine.

00:17.142 --> 00:18.349
An unsolved case.

00:18.477 --> 00:20.389
Both my children are dead.

00:20.521 --> 00:21.762
Because of you.

00:21.897 --> 00:24.640
Look at anything
that may connect Benjamin Zweig

00:24.775 --> 00:26.016
to the Santorelli boy.

00:26.151 --> 00:28.108
I must follow this
wherever it goes.

00:28.237 --> 00:31.071
Even if it leads me
to the darkest pit of hell.

01:11.071 --> 01:13.529
Are many children brought here?

01:13.657 --> 01:17.116
We only get the poor ones.

01:17.244 --> 01:19.236
It's the poorest children
I'm interested in.

01:19.371 --> 01:20.953
Specifically homicides.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.993
Plenty of those too.

01:24.710 --> 01:27.953
There may also have been removal
of the organs and body parts.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.045
Grave robbers
are still more common

01:30.173 --> 01:32.165
- than we would like.
- No, not grave robbers.

01:32.301 --> 01:34.964
These mutilations would have
served no medical purpose.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.257
Like the removal
of the tongue.

01:39.266 --> 01:41.508
Leviticus.

01:41.643 --> 01:43.350
Deuteronomy.

01:43.478 --> 01:45.891
Proverbs.
Proverbs.

01:46.023 --> 01:47.935
I beg your pardon?

01:49.234 --> 01:53.444
You wear no sign of your faith,
Doctor,

01:53.572 --> 01:59.739
yet you men of science insist
you're not in opposition to God.

01:59.870 --> 02:02.658
You insist you are God.

02:02.789 --> 02:05.497
I insist no such thing.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.868
I'll ask you again...

02:08.002 --> 02:09.585
Do you have experience
of corpses

02:09.713 --> 02:10.954
in which the tongue
was removed?

02:11.089 --> 02:12.455
No.

02:14.134 --> 02:18.253
But if it's the boy-whore
from the bridge,

02:18.388 --> 02:21.972
I'd say he had it coming.

02:31.193 --> 02:33.276
Shut her up, Doyle!

02:35.489 --> 02:37.902
Wait.

02:38.033 --> 02:41.652
Don't be showin' your face
no more around 300 Mulberry,

02:41.787 --> 02:42.868
you dumb guinea bastard.

02:46.458 --> 02:49.041
Anyone comes to see
the Santorelli family,

02:49.169 --> 02:52.879
you tell 'em
you ain't seen nothin'.

03:07.270 --> 03:10.604
This here's a warning,
Mr. Santorelli.

03:13.610 --> 03:18.651
You keep your dirty dago nose
out of police business, eh?

04:03.368 --> 04:05.576
Captain.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.700
'Tis surely
more pleasant on the eyes

04:08.832 --> 04:11.370
to have a woman on the premises,
isn't it, Sergeant Doyle?

04:11.501 --> 04:13.037
Ah, 'tis.

04:13.170 --> 04:14.251
Miss Howard.

04:19.968 --> 04:21.584
Would the commissioner
be about?

04:21.720 --> 04:24.679
He's attending disciplinary
hearings this afternoon.

04:24.806 --> 04:28.140
Right, well,
I just wanted to let him know

04:28.268 --> 04:29.871
the Santorellis,
they didn't have much to add

04:29.895 --> 04:32.854
by the way of facts to
the killin' of their poor boy.

04:33.982 --> 04:39.478
So don't hardly seem necessary
to make any further inquiry

04:39.613 --> 04:41.275
along those lines.

04:43.617 --> 04:44.949
Is there anything else?

04:46.536 --> 04:47.536
Beggin' your pardon.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.283
Eyelash.

04:54.503 --> 04:56.460
Huh.

04:56.588 --> 04:59.171
Go on, blow.
Bring you luck.

05:04.638 --> 05:05.674
Hm.

05:15.524 --> 05:18.358
Make sure you tell the
commissioner what I told you.

05:30.121 --> 05:32.408
I don't think
you've quite captured

05:32.541 --> 05:35.659
the line of her jaw, Mr. Moore.

06:11.246 --> 06:12.407
There.

06:12.539 --> 06:16.249
The resemblance now seems
more correct.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.085
Mm.

06:27.345 --> 06:30.759
Oh. Hello.

06:30.891 --> 06:33.258
Connor's been to see
the Santorellis.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.474
Does Roosevelt know?

06:34.603 --> 06:35.639
He's not in.

06:35.770 --> 06:37.477
But I want to
go talk to them.

06:37.606 --> 06:40.519
But you're employed
as a typewriter.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.312
I prefer the term "secretary,"

06:42.444 --> 06:45.562
but I have good reason
for wanting to involve myself.

06:47.115 --> 06:48.259
You'll not be welcome
in that part

06:48.283 --> 06:49.615
of the neighborhood,
you know.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.109
I may only be a secretary,

06:51.244 --> 06:53.201
but I do work
for the police department.

06:53.330 --> 06:55.242
Oh, the riffraff won't care
about that.

06:55.373 --> 06:58.081
Which is why I'll need you
to accompany me.

06:59.294 --> 07:01.502
They won't
care about that either.

07:01.630 --> 07:03.587
Are you saying you're afraid?

07:15.143 --> 07:16.884
Whoa, whoa.

07:17.020 --> 07:18.602
Whoa.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.321
Does Roosevelt know
you're doing this?

07:29.449 --> 07:30.760
When it comes
to the commissioner,

07:30.784 --> 07:32.776
I find it sometimes better
to ask forgiveness

07:32.911 --> 07:33.992
rather than permission.

08:03.942 --> 08:06.559
Oh, my God.
A baby.

08:06.695 --> 08:08.527
Sara, I wouldn't touch it.

08:08.655 --> 08:11.068
These children
are often diseased.

08:11.199 --> 08:12.199
Poor thing.

08:12.283 --> 08:13.945
Where's your mother?

08:14.077 --> 08:15.318
Where's your mother?

08:36.890 --> 08:38.347
Mrs. Santorelli.

08:40.770 --> 08:43.011
<i>Prego, prego.</i>

08:50.030 --> 08:51.612
<i>Il dotorre.</i>

08:59.539 --> 09:03.158
She thinks you're a doctor.
She called for one hours ago.

09:03.293 --> 09:04.500
What should I do?

09:04.627 --> 09:07.040
I don't know.
Pretend.

09:11.593 --> 09:14.677
Can you tell us about the men
who did this to your father?

09:16.222 --> 09:19.932
<i>Aspetta, Mamma.
Aspetta.</i>

09:20.935 --> 09:22.221
Two was cops.

09:22.353 --> 09:26.893
The other was some Holy Joe.

09:27.025 --> 09:28.561
What did they say?

09:28.693 --> 09:30.605
They say Giorgio died in sin,

09:30.737 --> 09:33.104
that it was better
for the family

09:33.239 --> 09:34.901
if we keep our mouths shut.

09:36.951 --> 09:38.817
<i>Calma, calma!</i>

09:38.953 --> 09:40.114
<i>Calma, Mamma.</i>

09:43.416 --> 09:44.374
<i>Calma.</i>

09:44.375 --> 09:46.367
I can't make out
what she's saying.

09:46.503 --> 09:49.166
She talks about my brother.

09:50.548 --> 09:52.289
Giorgio wasn't like
the other boys.

09:55.095 --> 09:58.429
Papa, he beat Giorgio.
He call him a girl.

09:58.556 --> 10:01.219
That's why he ran away.

10:08.024 --> 10:12.359
She say police
say Giorgio is the same

10:12.487 --> 10:14.228
as the other boys
who were killed.

10:14.364 --> 10:16.981
Nobody care.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.528
Other boys?

10:26.251 --> 10:28.914
Let me try that one.

10:30.797 --> 10:32.663
That looks good.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.691
Look.
The same knife marks.

10:54.779 --> 10:55.779
We'll take this one.

11:04.831 --> 11:07.198
Thinking about becoming
a socialist now, are you?

11:07.333 --> 11:08.973
You know the difference
between capitalism

11:09.043 --> 11:10.043
and socialism?

11:10.044 --> 11:11.376
No.

11:14.340 --> 11:17.003
In capitalism,
man exploits man.

11:18.303 --> 11:19.919
In socialism,
it's the other way around.

11:20.054 --> 11:21.323
Hyah! Go on!

11:21.347 --> 11:22.758
Giddyup there.

11:34.068 --> 11:39.063
Every night, Dr. Kreizler,
every night, she touches.

11:41.034 --> 11:45.028
The priest say she needs
ice bath and leeches.

11:45.163 --> 11:46.529
Leeches?

11:48.374 --> 11:52.118
The priest say
the devil is in her mind.

11:52.253 --> 11:53.619
That's why I bring her
to you.

11:53.755 --> 11:55.371
Mrs. Rajk,
there is nothing wrong

11:55.506 --> 11:57.088
with your daughter's mind.

11:58.676 --> 12:00.793
You're becoming a young woman.

12:00.929 --> 12:03.216
And there's not a thing
your mother nor any priest

12:03.348 --> 12:05.214
can do about it.

12:12.273 --> 12:16.108
The body's the temple
of the Holy Spirit.

12:16.236 --> 12:20.822
It is a blessed gift
not to be defiled by lust.

12:29.624 --> 12:32.833
Yes, I too learned Scripture
when I was young.

12:32.961 --> 12:35.829
But instead of answers,
I found only questions.

12:35.964 --> 12:38.957
Why does God allow us to feel
both pleasure and pain?

12:39.092 --> 12:40.879
Why has he given a young girl
like Berthe

12:41.010 --> 12:42.010
impulses and desires

12:42.095 --> 12:44.508
she cannot begin to fathom
or control?

12:44.639 --> 12:47.256
Is this the God
of whom you speak?

12:47.392 --> 12:49.759
This is a sanctuary
for the young.

12:49.894 --> 12:51.510
I will not tolerate
its trespass,

12:51.646 --> 12:52.932
neither by man, nor by God.

12:53.064 --> 12:56.307
Now, please, remove yourselves
from the premises.

13:05.410 --> 13:08.244
Excuse me, Detective.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.667
The commissioner
is looking for some files

13:15.795 --> 13:17.286
of unresolved cases.

13:17.422 --> 13:19.334
Homicides.

13:19.465 --> 13:20.672
Where might I find them?

13:20.800 --> 13:23.668
- The old dogs.
- I beg your pardon?

13:23.803 --> 13:26.045
Unsolved cases.

13:29.017 --> 13:32.260
They keep barkin' at you
from the files

13:32.395 --> 13:35.354
like old dogs.

13:35.481 --> 13:38.064
Woof. Woof.

13:38.192 --> 13:39.192
I see.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.276
In there.

15:40.398 --> 15:41.684
I know.

15:54.370 --> 15:56.487
There were
other murdered boys.

15:58.749 --> 16:00.456
As I suspected at the morgue.

16:00.585 --> 16:02.417
Who were they?

16:02.545 --> 16:04.036
The Negro boy's identity
was unknown.

16:04.172 --> 16:05.708
The other boy
was named Aaron Morton.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.640
I found a brief mention
of him in the "Herald"

16:07.758 --> 16:09.465
about a month ago.

16:09.594 --> 16:12.712
He worked at a brothel
called Shang Draper's.

16:12.847 --> 16:14.338
He was killed
like the Santorelli boy

16:14.474 --> 16:16.466
and his body hidden
on the Brooklyn Bridge.

16:16.601 --> 16:17.953
It's imperative
that we examine them

16:17.977 --> 16:19.121
to see
if there's a connection.

16:19.145 --> 16:20.103
Impossible.

16:20.104 --> 16:21.345
The Negro morgue on Bleecker

16:21.481 --> 16:23.125
burns the remains
of anyone left unclaimed.

16:23.149 --> 16:25.766
And I could find no family,
which means Aaron Morton

16:25.902 --> 16:27.609
was probably buried
in Potter's Field.

16:27.737 --> 16:29.148
But that's not all of it.

16:29.280 --> 16:32.444
The files of both boys
were kept hidden.

16:32.575 --> 16:34.362
I found them only by chance.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.486
There could well be others.

16:42.210 --> 16:44.452
This information
is invaluable, Miss Howard.

16:44.587 --> 16:45.953
Thank you.

16:46.088 --> 16:47.954
Is Roosevelt aware
of what you've done?

16:48.090 --> 16:49.331
No.

16:50.635 --> 16:51.635
Have you plans tonight?

16:51.761 --> 16:53.218
Yes.

16:53.346 --> 16:56.510
If I have a carriage
sent 'round at 9:00,

16:56.641 --> 16:58.052
can your plans be altered?

16:58.184 --> 16:59.720
Is that a request or a command,
Doctor?

16:59.852 --> 17:02.139
As you like it,
Miss Howard.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.141
Let me help you.

17:29.257 --> 17:30.998
Thank you, Mary.

17:38.849 --> 17:41.216
What else did you learn
about Santorelli?

17:41.352 --> 17:42.934
His brother said
that he was different.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.143
Different?

17:44.272 --> 17:46.309
I had the distinct impression
that other boys

17:46.440 --> 17:49.899
found Giorgio
in some manner effete or,

17:50.027 --> 17:54.692
well, inclined toward
contrary sexual instinct.

17:54.824 --> 17:56.134
Being effete
and being inclined

17:56.158 --> 17:57.774
toward a contrary
sexual instinct

17:57.910 --> 17:58.910
are two different things.

17:58.995 --> 18:00.264
Now, was the boy
one or the other?

18:00.288 --> 18:02.450
Or was he both
the former and the latter?

18:02.582 --> 18:04.369
I'm sure I don't know.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.180
All his brother said
was that Giorgio

18:06.252 --> 18:09.461
was different from the other
boys and that he'd run away.

18:14.510 --> 18:16.297
- Was he beaten?
- Hm!

18:16.429 --> 18:19.843
What boy isn't in that
godforsaken part of the city?

18:21.726 --> 18:24.093
Two more boys murdered.

18:25.771 --> 18:28.730
He needs to feed his hunger
like an addict.

18:28.858 --> 18:31.441
He can't go very long
without killing again.

18:57.011 --> 18:58.718
Come closer, child.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.721
What's wrong with your mouth?

19:14.862 --> 19:17.821
Hey! Hey!

19:17.948 --> 19:20.315
Tell me about
Miss Howard.

19:20.451 --> 19:21.678
I'll tell you about Miss Howard

19:21.702 --> 19:24.194
if you tell me
where we're going.

19:24.330 --> 19:26.447
I've noticed
she wears a man's signet ring.

19:26.582 --> 19:28.164
Why do you take such pleasure

19:28.292 --> 19:30.284
in keeping everyone
in the dark about your plans?

19:30.419 --> 19:31.660
Hmm?

19:35.424 --> 19:37.507
The ring was her father's.

19:38.511 --> 19:41.254
A rather sad situation.

19:41.389 --> 19:45.053
A hunting accident, or at least
that was the official story.

19:45.184 --> 19:48.928
The rumors were that he died
by his own hand.

19:49.063 --> 19:51.476
- How old was she?
- 12.

19:51.607 --> 19:54.270
At the time,
she was sent to a sanitarium.

19:54.402 --> 19:56.769
She'd lost her mother
when she was still quite young.

19:58.447 --> 20:00.313
Perhaps you should
measure her skull

20:00.449 --> 20:02.611
to see how it affected her.

20:06.288 --> 20:07.620
Have you interest in her?

20:07.748 --> 20:10.115
Good God, Laszlo. I've known
her since she was a child.

20:10.251 --> 20:11.332
She's no longer a child.

20:11.460 --> 20:12.996
I've not thought of her
in that way.

20:13.129 --> 20:14.336
Certainly you have.

20:22.930 --> 20:24.466
No, Tessie.

20:24.598 --> 20:25.930
I'll not wear an evening dress

20:26.058 --> 20:27.799
as I have no need
to flatter myself.

20:27.935 --> 20:30.393
Will there be
gentlemen present?

20:32.231 --> 20:35.645
I should say, rather, there
will be colleagues present.

20:35.776 --> 20:37.608
Colleagues are gentlemen, too.

20:37.737 --> 20:40.400
All the more reason
to make an impression.

21:00.676 --> 21:03.009
Who's that
sitting with Roosevelt?

21:04.305 --> 21:06.012
You mean to tell me
you don't recognize

21:06.140 --> 21:07.631
the mayor of New York City?

21:07.767 --> 21:11.135
- That's Mayor Strong?
- Mm-hmm.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.011
My God, he's aged.

21:21.822 --> 21:26.066
Hm.
His family grows by the day.

21:26.202 --> 21:27.818
What are you talking about?

21:27.953 --> 21:30.161
J.P. Morgan.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.952
Every beautiful young lady
he's seen with

21:33.083 --> 21:34.540
claims to be his niece.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.414
Poor Roosevelt.

21:40.549 --> 21:43.007
He dislikes the opera
as much as you do.

21:43.135 --> 21:46.219
Hm. Doubtful.

21:48.599 --> 21:50.682
Don't wait up for us tonight,
Mama.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.769
We have police business.

21:58.609 --> 22:00.316
She means you stink
like a 10-cent whore.

22:00.444 --> 22:01.810
How would you know?

22:03.781 --> 22:04.817
- Mommy?
- Hmm?

22:11.539 --> 22:13.872
That's not tonight, Mama.

22:42.611 --> 22:44.193
Is it over?

22:44.321 --> 22:45.528
Intermezzo.

22:56.667 --> 22:57.908
Thank you.

23:02.548 --> 23:05.461
Very well. I shall be forced
to drink for two.

23:09.513 --> 23:12.927
Mayor Strong.
It's wonderful to see you again.

23:13.058 --> 23:15.926
- You're looking well, sir.
- Thank you.

23:16.061 --> 23:18.178
I'm Dr. Kreizler.

23:18.314 --> 23:20.397
The alienist?

23:20.524 --> 23:23.062
Good evening, Commissioner.

23:24.194 --> 23:26.151
- Good evening, Mr. Roosevelt.
- Robert.

23:26.280 --> 23:28.192
- Theodore.
- Tom.

23:28.324 --> 23:29.324
Why tonight?

23:29.325 --> 23:30.552
Good evening, Commissioner.

23:30.576 --> 23:31.737
I need something from you.

23:31.869 --> 23:34.077
Examination of the Zweig boy
revealed serrations

23:34.204 --> 23:37.163
on the malar bone and
supraorbital ridge of both eyes.

23:37.291 --> 23:38.998
Someone cut his eyes out
with a knife.

23:39.126 --> 23:40.854
This is neither
the time nor the place

23:40.878 --> 23:42.790
to discuss the postmortem
of a child.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.482
I shouldn't even be seen
talking to you.

23:44.590 --> 23:46.627
It was no scavenger
that left those marks,

23:46.759 --> 23:49.467
and if I were a betting man,
I'd wager rather a large sum

23:49.595 --> 23:51.086
on the probability
that the same marks

23:51.221 --> 23:54.259
will be present on the eye
sockets of Giorgio Santorelli.

23:54.391 --> 23:56.257
That will be determined
by the coroner.

23:56.393 --> 23:58.259
That may well take months,
if ever.

23:58.395 --> 24:00.075
And it's two more boys
of the lower classes

24:00.147 --> 24:01.604
have recently be murdered,

24:01.732 --> 24:03.532
although your police
seem to be more concerned

24:03.609 --> 24:06.101
with covering up the crimes
than finding the perpetrator.

24:06.236 --> 24:08.353
How did you come by
this knowledge?

24:08.489 --> 24:10.105
That I cannot tell you.

24:11.492 --> 24:12.824
Even if I wanted to,

24:12.952 --> 24:15.239
I cannot allow you access
to the body,

24:15.371 --> 24:16.737
as it's still in police custody.

24:16.872 --> 24:18.784
Your Isaacson brothers
have proven themselves

24:18.916 --> 24:20.123
more than capable.

24:22.544 --> 24:24.160
T.R.

24:24.296 --> 24:26.208
J.P. Mm.

24:28.050 --> 24:29.050
Damn it, Kreizler.

24:30.135 --> 24:31.967
In addition,
I shall require a liaison

24:32.096 --> 24:33.198
who will provide information

24:33.222 --> 24:34.554
from within
the police department

24:34.682 --> 24:36.282
without revealing
their connection to me.

24:36.350 --> 24:38.137
Are you suggesting
you should be allowed

24:38.268 --> 24:40.100
to conduct
a parallel investigation?

24:40.229 --> 24:41.470
Yes.

24:41.605 --> 24:45.315
Your secretary, Miss Howard,
is perfectly placed.

24:56.870 --> 24:58.827
Please, enjoy the rest
of your evening.

24:58.956 --> 25:00.242
Thank you.

25:07.548 --> 25:09.505
Good to see you again.

25:13.178 --> 25:16.012
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

25:20.352 --> 25:21.968
All right.

25:24.440 --> 25:25.440
Let go!

25:25.441 --> 25:26.852
Thank you.

25:52.885 --> 25:54.467
How are you?

26:08.734 --> 26:10.942
Are you perchance waiting
for Dr. Kreizler?

26:11.070 --> 26:12.527
Yes, I am.

26:12.654 --> 26:15.897
I'm Detective Sergeant
Marcus Isaacson.

26:16.992 --> 26:18.073
This is my brother.

26:18.202 --> 26:21.115
Detective Sergeant
Lucius Isaacson.

26:22.539 --> 26:23.780
I'm Sara Howard.

26:23.916 --> 26:26.499
I work for
Commissioner Roosevelt.

26:26.627 --> 26:29.290
You're here to take notes?

26:29.421 --> 26:32.004
Frankly, I don't know
why I'm here.

26:32.674 --> 26:36.258
My apologies
for the lateness of our arrival.

26:36.386 --> 26:38.628
Charlie, you may let
Monsieur Ranhofer

26:38.764 --> 26:39.764
know we are ready.

26:42.267 --> 26:43.508
A toast.

26:43.644 --> 26:46.933
To the beginning
of a fruitful partnership.

26:53.487 --> 26:54.819
I don't think the wine
is kosher.

26:54.947 --> 26:57.860
I thought we'd start
with a terrapin soup au clair.

26:57.991 --> 27:00.108
One of the specialties
of the house.

27:03.247 --> 27:06.490
I hope no one minds serious
conversation while we eat,

27:06.625 --> 27:08.491
but I believe it's best
to get a running start.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.994
Well, perhaps you could tell us

27:11.130 --> 27:13.338
what exactly we're getting
a running start at.

27:13.465 --> 27:14.672
Oh, my.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.236
I've gotten ahead of myself,
haven't I?

27:16.260 --> 27:17.876
Of course.

27:18.011 --> 27:19.172
I should explain.

27:19.304 --> 27:20.545
Perhaps if we begin,

27:20.681 --> 27:23.469
your intentions
will become self-explanatory.

27:26.979 --> 27:27.979
Please.

27:29.189 --> 27:31.476
We've already
made Dr. Kreizler aware

27:31.608 --> 27:34.146
of the results of our
examination of the Zweig boy.

27:34.278 --> 27:35.814
The torso was grossly violated

27:35.946 --> 27:38.133
while the eyes were carefully
plucked from their sockets.

27:38.157 --> 27:39.398
Gentlemen.

27:39.533 --> 27:41.115
There is a lady present.

27:41.243 --> 27:42.734
Oh, enough, John.

27:42.870 --> 27:44.987
I am perfectly capable
of hearing

27:45.122 --> 27:46.909
whatever it is
that needs to be said.

27:49.209 --> 27:51.872
- Hm.
- Continue, please.

27:53.088 --> 27:55.501
Thus, we asked ourselves,
"What instrument

27:55.632 --> 27:59.546
might be found capable of both
cutting muscles and tendons

27:59.678 --> 28:01.840
and prying eyeballs
from their sockets?"

28:02.973 --> 28:06.683
Behold, the Arkansas Toothpick.

28:08.187 --> 28:09.769
The blade is strong enough
to cause

28:09.897 --> 28:11.559
the wounds the boy suffered to
his torso.

28:11.690 --> 28:15.809
But finely weighted to
delicately remove his eyes.

28:39.301 --> 28:41.133
Huh! Hyah!

28:45.933 --> 28:47.344
Let's eat.

28:48.727 --> 28:53.813
You been grooming them horses,
mucking out those stables,

28:53.941 --> 28:56.274
and touching
your own private self.

28:56.401 --> 28:59.018
Clean your hands before you eat.

28:59.154 --> 29:01.396
I don't know why I have to
keep telling you that.

29:03.075 --> 29:04.782
Gentlemen,
you've done fine work.

29:04.910 --> 29:08.324
But there may well be thousands
of Arkansas Toothpicks about,

29:08.455 --> 29:09.912
even in New York City.

29:10.916 --> 29:12.623
Which is why we have something

29:12.751 --> 29:15.619
that may prove
infinitely more useful.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.541
Dactyloscopy.

29:17.673 --> 29:20.006
The science of a finger, palm,

29:20.133 --> 29:22.216
or foot
leaving a chance impression.

29:22.344 --> 29:23.630
The one on the left is mine.

29:23.762 --> 29:25.424
And the one
on the right is mine.

29:25.555 --> 29:27.262
And yet we're twins.

29:27.391 --> 29:28.507
Fraternal.

29:28.642 --> 29:30.474
Hmm.

29:30.602 --> 29:32.288
There are those,
including the majority

29:32.312 --> 29:33.992
of our colleagues
in the police department,

29:34.064 --> 29:36.147
who do not accept fingermarks
as evidence,

29:36.275 --> 29:38.483
but the science
behind it has...

29:38.610 --> 29:40.317
It has been proved reliable.

29:42.739 --> 29:43.775
I've read about this.

29:45.200 --> 29:47.157
Isn't it surmised
that a person's fingermarks

29:47.286 --> 29:48.993
do not change
throughout their lifetime

29:49.121 --> 29:50.121
and that each is unique?

29:50.205 --> 29:51.821
Precisely.
However, certain conditions

29:51.957 --> 29:53.664
must be met
in order to preserve them.

29:53.792 --> 29:56.500
And bodies immersed in water
like the Zweigs

29:56.628 --> 29:57.914
would not meet those conditions.

29:58.046 --> 30:02.290
Indeed not, but we found this.

30:10.642 --> 30:14.477
A bloody fingermark left
on the back of this timepiece.

30:15.522 --> 30:17.058
We discovered the trinket

30:17.190 --> 30:18.681
within the Zweig boy's
burial suit.

30:21.278 --> 30:22.894
Their file referenced it.

30:23.030 --> 30:25.522
It was found on the roof
near the water tank, wasn't it?

30:25.657 --> 30:27.774
And thus spared degradation.

30:27.909 --> 30:30.026
A person leaving
a fingermark such as this

30:30.162 --> 30:32.074
might as well drop
a monogrammed handkerchief.

30:35.959 --> 30:37.746
And so he did.

30:39.212 --> 30:40.293
Who?

30:40.422 --> 30:42.414
You talk about him
as if you know him.

30:42.549 --> 30:44.882
We don't yet know him, John.

30:45.010 --> 30:46.171
But we will.

30:47.429 --> 30:50.422
We may not know his name
or where he lives,

30:50.557 --> 30:52.594
but he exists in plain sight.

30:52.726 --> 30:54.638
Though evidence
does not immediately reveal him,

30:54.770 --> 30:57.057
there are hints and indications
to his identity

30:57.189 --> 31:00.148
that he's unwittingly
left behind.

31:00.275 --> 31:03.643
Now our task is to gather
those hints and indications

31:03.779 --> 31:05.566
to construct an image
of the man...

31:05.697 --> 31:08.531
his age, his background,
his habits,

31:08.658 --> 31:12.117
but most importantly,
his appetites.

31:12.245 --> 31:15.113
Look at who his victims are,

31:15.248 --> 31:18.867
where he commits his crimes,
and what exactly he does to them

31:19.002 --> 31:21.460
until a pattern
begins to emerge.

31:23.215 --> 31:26.583
Each and every one
of the choices he makes

31:26.718 --> 31:30.553
will reveal a hidden aspect
of his alienated mind.

31:33.683 --> 31:37.176
And there's one more thing.

31:37.312 --> 31:42.228
We know the killer's conscious
thoughts are fixed on violence.

31:42.359 --> 31:44.021
If we get too close,

31:44.152 --> 31:47.395
that violence might well
spill over onto us.

32:00.210 --> 32:01.417
You're not asking Sara

32:01.545 --> 32:03.958
to join this mad escapade
of yours, are you?

32:04.089 --> 32:05.775
It will put her
in a most compromised position.

32:05.799 --> 32:07.652
Look at the beasts that
surround her on a daily basis.

32:07.676 --> 32:09.793
I believe
she's up to the task.

32:09.928 --> 32:12.261
She's not as strong
as she'd like you to believe.

32:12.389 --> 32:14.472
John, please.

32:14.599 --> 32:16.199
Do not let your affection
for Miss Howard

32:16.309 --> 32:18.301
get in the way of logic.

32:18.437 --> 32:20.850
My affection?!

32:20.981 --> 32:22.142
My God.

32:22.274 --> 32:25.392
Do you never tire
of the sound of your own voice?

32:25.527 --> 32:28.065
Miss Howard is resourceful.
She's loyal to Roosevelt.

32:28.196 --> 32:31.155
And because she's a woman, she's
unlikely to arouse suspicion.

32:31.283 --> 32:33.866
That is quite sufficient
for my purposes.

32:33.994 --> 32:37.328
And what is my role to be
in all of this?

32:41.418 --> 32:43.785
Perhaps you've
already played it.

32:50.135 --> 32:51.175
It's something new.

32:51.303 --> 32:53.340
Forensic science
married with human psychology.

32:53.472 --> 32:55.179
One might easily imagine
the ramifications

32:55.307 --> 32:56.388
if we are successful.

32:56.516 --> 32:58.508
I rather like it.

32:58.643 --> 32:59.679
Miss Howard.

32:59.811 --> 33:01.018
- Miss Howard.
- Gentlemen.

33:01.146 --> 33:02.957
- May I offer you a ride?
- No, thank you, Doctor.

33:02.981 --> 33:04.597
- Please go on without us.
- Very well.

33:04.733 --> 33:06.895
- Good evening, then.
- Good evening.

33:09.112 --> 33:11.729
John.
Are you coming with us?

33:11.865 --> 33:13.106
I'd prefer to walk.

33:13.241 --> 33:14.357
At this hour?

33:14.493 --> 33:16.530
I'm not a child.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.287
He's had too much to drink.

33:20.415 --> 33:21.642
He was offered a ride.

33:21.666 --> 33:23.328
Perhaps you might have insisted.

33:23.460 --> 33:26.248
A little resentment and
introspection will do him good.

33:26.379 --> 33:29.372
He's not as strong
as he'd like you to think.

33:30.967 --> 33:32.959
You find that amusing?

33:33.094 --> 33:34.801
Our weaknesses
sometimes serve us

33:34.930 --> 33:36.091
better than our strengths.

33:36.223 --> 33:38.510
I'm surprised to hear you admit
you've a weakness.

33:38.642 --> 33:40.258
I was speaking metaphorically.

33:45.233 --> 33:46.723
- Stevie!
- Yes, sir?

33:46.858 --> 33:48.724
Run along and keep an eye
on Mr. Moore.

33:48.860 --> 33:49.860
You bet.

33:54.324 --> 33:56.486
Let's go, boys.
Let's go.

34:02.874 --> 34:05.116
The working man, woman,

34:05.252 --> 34:07.118
and, all too often,
the working child

34:07.254 --> 34:09.792
are, in effect,
the slaves of America.

34:12.050 --> 34:16.761
We call on all honest citizens
to unite beneath the banner

34:16.888 --> 34:19.255
of the Socialist Labor Party
of America...

34:20.934 --> 34:23.391
...that we may make use
of our political liberty

34:23.520 --> 34:26.763
and bring an end to
the current barbarous struggle

34:26.898 --> 34:27.934
of the oppressed.

34:29.859 --> 34:30.859
Evening.

34:30.860 --> 34:32.567
- This emancipation...
- Yes.

34:32.696 --> 34:34.733
...is not only possible,
it is inevitable,

34:34.864 --> 34:37.732
since all we need do
to move forward in equality

34:37.867 --> 34:40.530
is to stand together now
in unity.

34:43.748 --> 34:47.833
Pardon my candidness,
but I feel I must ask.

34:47.960 --> 34:50.704
Did you have this evening
entirely planned?

34:52.424 --> 34:56.007
What exactly do you mean
by "entirely"?

34:56.136 --> 34:59.004
That we... <i>I...</i>

34:59.139 --> 35:00.846
would agree to assist you.

35:02.100 --> 35:04.012
Aside from the job
of scrubbing floors,

35:04.144 --> 35:05.384
you're the first woman employed

35:05.478 --> 35:07.720
by the New York
Police Department.

35:07.856 --> 35:09.597
That shows initiative

35:09.733 --> 35:13.647
and a desire to advance
your place in society.

35:13.778 --> 35:15.440
Am I mistaken?

35:16.615 --> 35:18.106
No.

35:19.284 --> 35:20.344
I've asked the commissioner

35:20.368 --> 35:22.735
for you to be the liaison
between us.

35:22.871 --> 35:24.658
Your task will be
to keep me informed

35:24.789 --> 35:26.325
of developments
within the department

35:26.458 --> 35:30.418
and keep Roosevelt abreast
of our actions outside it.

35:30.545 --> 35:32.502
And he agreed?

35:34.716 --> 35:37.003
Perhaps not in so many words.

35:38.637 --> 35:39.673
Come on, boy.

35:41.264 --> 35:42.971
Whoa.

35:45.977 --> 35:48.219
Steady.

35:54.861 --> 35:57.353
May I assume
you have an interest?

35:58.365 --> 36:01.529
It wouldn't be fair to assume
anything about me, Doctor.

36:03.453 --> 36:06.161
You look lovely this evening,
Miss Howard.

36:09.501 --> 36:11.493
Cyrus.

36:11.628 --> 36:13.085
Please see Miss Howard
to the door.

36:13.213 --> 36:14.249
Yes, sir.

36:14.381 --> 36:16.748
I can see myself in,
thank you.

36:50.792 --> 36:52.533
What did you say your name was?

36:52.669 --> 36:54.535
Esther. And you?

36:54.671 --> 36:55.752
Marcus.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.212
Nice to meet you.

36:57.340 --> 36:58.626
Likewise.

37:14.983 --> 37:17.066
Heads up!

37:20.155 --> 37:22.647
Yeah, sir, this will
literally cure psoriasis.

37:25.452 --> 37:27.535
Ties!
Fine ties!

37:27.662 --> 37:29.153
Good ties!

37:36.713 --> 37:38.875
Ladies and gentlemen...

37:39.007 --> 37:41.294
take repose
on this beautiful settee.

37:41.426 --> 37:43.042

Good evening, sir.

39:40.795 --> 39:43.333
If you don't ask
questions, I don't give answers.

39:45.216 --> 39:47.173
- I like you.
- I like you.

39:47.302 --> 39:48.982
You aren't the same

39:49.053 --> 39:50.510
No, I'm not.

39:50.638 --> 39:53.301

- What's your price?

39:53.433 --> 39:55.720
Now, we've all kind

39:55.852 --> 39:59.596
A little, uh, pleasure?

39:59.731 --> 40:02.769
A little, uh, pain?

40:02.901 --> 40:04.233
What do you fancy?

40:09.908 --> 40:11.820
I'm seeking information.

40:11.951 --> 40:14.443
I want to know about
Giorgio Santorelli.

40:19.792 --> 40:22.125
Hm.

40:22.253 --> 40:23.573
And why should
I tell you anything

40:23.630 --> 40:27.214
I ain't already told the cops?

40:27.342 --> 40:30.301
Because it could happen again.

40:30.428 --> 40:34.672
Another one of your girls
could disappear,

40:34.807 --> 40:36.173
and her dismembered body

40:36.309 --> 40:41.054
unceremoniously dumped
in some lonely venue.

40:41.189 --> 40:42.976
There's only so many times

40:43.107 --> 40:45.895
the police
can look the other way.

40:48.821 --> 40:49.982
All right.

40:50.114 --> 40:51.275
What do you want to know?

40:51.407 --> 40:53.194
Who saw the boy?

40:55.286 --> 40:56.697
What type of clients were they?

40:56.829 --> 40:58.536
What were their predilections?

40:58.665 --> 41:01.658
The boy
had a filthy mouth on him.

41:01.793 --> 41:03.955
His regulars liked to hear
how worthless they were,

41:04.087 --> 41:06.830
how they didn't, uh,
measure up.

41:06.965 --> 41:09.048

42:52.987 --> 42:54.603
$5.

43:01.079 --> 43:04.038
No, no, no.

43:04.165 --> 43:07.579
Tell me about Giorgio.

43:07.710 --> 43:09.747
Gloria.

43:12.465 --> 43:14.582
She had lots of regulars.

43:14.717 --> 43:16.879
Some very nice ones.

43:17.011 --> 43:20.630
Some very rich ones.

43:20.765 --> 43:25.305
She only talked about the one
with the silver smile, though.

43:26.771 --> 43:28.433
Silver smile?

43:30.983 --> 43:32.690
What was his name?

43:32.819 --> 43:35.562
Do you know?

43:35.696 --> 43:37.483
You're not very fun.

43:41.953 --> 43:44.036
In fact,
you're no fun at all.

43:46.707 --> 43:50.121
Did she leave with him
that night?

43:50.253 --> 43:53.041
The one
with the silver smile?

43:53.172 --> 43:55.129
Gloria never left her room.

43:58.386 --> 44:00.924
We heard her in there,
but she never came out.

44:05.601 --> 44:07.684
We got tired of waiting.

44:07.812 --> 44:10.099
When we broke the lock,
there was no sign of her.

44:10.231 --> 44:11.972
There was no sign of anybody.

44:28.708 --> 44:30.495
It was a three-story drop.

44:32.503 --> 44:34.244
And Gloria didn't have wings.

44:41.679 --> 44:42.840
You're lying.

44:53.232 --> 44:55.224
You're lying.

45:07.455 --> 45:09.617
Even without wings...

45:11.083 --> 45:13.200
...Gloria flew away.

45:14.629 --> 45:17.292
And someday I will, too.

45:17.423 --> 45:18.959
Is that...

45:43.658 --> 45:45.115
Ain't that sweet?

45:45.243 --> 45:46.279
You know who he is?

45:46.410 --> 45:49.778
Hm.
I seen him before.

45:49.914 --> 45:51.200
He's a friend of Roosevelt

45:51.332 --> 45:53.540
and that
alienist son of a bitch.

45:53.668 --> 45:57.127
This is an unfortunate
situation, gentlemen.

45:57.255 --> 46:01.750
I'm afraid it's gonna force us
to take actions of our own.

46:02.843 --> 46:04.800
What do you want to
do with him?

46:08.266 --> 46:09.928
Come on in, girls.
