00:39.540 --> 00:42.667
America is still going
to the polls at 4:00.

00:42.751 --> 00:46.045
With some precincts opening
as early as 1 2 this morning,

00:46.130 --> 00:47.839
voters across the country are deciding

00:47.923 --> 00:50.341
who will holdthe most important
office in the fr--

00:58.934 --> 01:00.977
Herman Phillips, Bert Cooper.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.937
Actually, "Herman" goes on my checks.

01:03.021 --> 01:04.230
People call me Duck.

01:04.314 --> 01:06.149
My research says I was not to call you Duck.

01:06.233 --> 01:07.483
You should have told me that.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.610
I don't know. I like when you say Herman .

01:11.029 --> 01:13.948
Herman was in London with Y&R.

01:14.032 --> 01:15.783
Isn't this a step down?

01:15.868 --> 01:16.784
I don't know.

01:16.869 --> 01:18.953
Moving back to the power center
of the universe, New York,

01:19.037 --> 01:21.080
and the chance to put on some weight.

01:21.165 --> 01:24.959
English food . I actually ate a kidney.

01:25.043 --> 01:26.836
He landed American Airlines.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.963
You could make something
like that happen here.

01:29.047 --> 01:30.965
Well, you have to
spend money to make money.

01:31.049 --> 01:32.633
So you're not promising anything.

01:32.718 --> 01:34.093
Why would I do that?

01:35.137 --> 01:38.681
My goodness, he does want this job.

01:38.766 --> 01:41.893
I hope you play your cards
close to the vest with clients.

01:41.977 --> 01:43.728
I will keep that in mind .

01:43.812 --> 01:45.563
Here's a test. Who'd you vote for?

01:45.647 --> 01:48.649
If I say N ixon, you'll think
I'm buttering you .

01:48.734 --> 01:50.985
If I say Kennedy,
you'll want to reform me.

01:51.069 --> 01:53.404
So, uh , I'll say N ixon .

01:55.073 --> 01:57.074
That's nice to see.

02:06.084 --> 02:08.294
Cooper has a smoker
at The Waldorf at 6:00.

02:08.378 --> 02:09.295
Marge told me.

02:09.379 --> 02:10.421
23 skidoo.

02:10.506 --> 02:14.217
At 6: 1 5, we turn on the returns
and send for some ice.

02:14.301 --> 02:16.010
Party at the in-laws'.

02:16.094 --> 02:17.720
Another ending to a perfect day.

02:17.805 --> 02:20.181
Well, Jennifer and I were going
to get tickets to Can-Can.

02:20.265 --> 02:21.516
It's empty, you know.

02:21.642 --> 02:24.227
She says apparently the phone company
is a war zone on election night.

02:24.311 --> 02:25.770
That's what I'm
hoping for around here.

02:25.854 --> 02:28.064
Although, You better hope that
she's sitting at her switchboard

02:28.148 --> 02:30.024
and not doing what we're doing .

02:30.108 --> 02:31.484
It's my wife.

02:33.111 --> 02:34.904
Besides, what if N ixon loses?

02:34.988 --> 02:36.197
Won't that put a damper
on things around here?

02:36.281 --> 02:38.199
Who cares? They didn't want our help.

02:38.283 --> 02:39.534
You should care.

02:39.618 --> 02:42.870
I do, It matters for the nation
and for Sterling Coop.

02:42.955 --> 02:44.705
But tonight, either way.

02:44.790 --> 02:46.165
If Nixon wins, we win .

02:46.250 --> 02:47.667
If Nixon loses--

02:49.127 --> 02:51.128
let me console you .

02:59.137 --> 03:00.847
That's him .

03:00.931 --> 03:02.265
Duck Phillips.

03:02.349 --> 03:03.724
I know his name.

03:03.809 --> 03:05.268
Because it's Duck?

03:08.689 --> 03:10.064
I grew up with a Tuck.

03:10.148 --> 03:12.066
At least that has an air of dignity.

03:12.150 --> 03:14.277
Don took him to Cooper. That's a first.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.529
I heard he disintegrated in London.

03:16.613 --> 03:20.157
Got involved with some woman
he met at the British Museum .

03:20.242 --> 03:21.993
Her name was Rosetta.

03:22.077 --> 03:23.870
Rosetta Stone.

03:25.789 --> 03:28.082
He's divorced . Lives in a hotel .

03:28.166 --> 03:31.627
So what's this? H is last stop?

03:31.712 --> 03:34.088
No. He's a killer, but he's--
he's damaged goods.

03:34.172 --> 03:35.298
They're bargain hunting .

03:35.382 --> 03:37.216
He's the best one
Draper's paraded around .

03:37.301 --> 03:40.720
Let's see if Cooper's
smart enough to know that.

03:44.850 --> 03:46.642
Can I help you?

03:46.727 --> 03:48.102
What?

03:48.186 --> 03:50.146
Can I help you?

03:51.523 --> 03:53.858
M r. Campbell would like to see you .

03:55.152 --> 03:57.111
Send him in .

03:57.195 --> 03:58.821
Thank you , sweetheart.

04:08.206 --> 04:10.124
So that Duck fellow,

04:10.208 --> 04:12.168
I heard he fell apart in London .

04:12.252 --> 04:14.086
American Airlines.

04:14.171 --> 04:16.130
$7 million in billings.

04:16.214 --> 04:18.674
He's not going to bring that with him .

04:21.803 --> 04:26.682
Listen , Don, I don't feel you've taken me
seriously as a candidate.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.142
Candidate for what?

04:28.226 --> 04:31.562
For the head of account services.

04:31.647 --> 04:33.356
We may have had our differences,

04:33.440 --> 04:35.566
but Roger knows I've done everything
I could to emulate him .

04:35.651 --> 04:37.485
Roger's not involved in this.

04:37.569 --> 04:39.111
Anything else?

04:39.196 --> 04:42.156
I have the loyalty
of our most important clients:

04:42.240 --> 04:44.033
Calvin H ighland , Lee Garner.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.618
These men trust me.

04:45.702 --> 04:47.411
They invite me
to their grandchildren's christenings.

04:47.496 --> 04:49.497
When Walter Veidt needed a urologist,

04:49.581 --> 04:51.165
he called me
for a recommendation .

04:51.249 --> 04:55.711
Look, you're good at your job,
Cooper loves you .

04:55.796 --> 04:57.046
What's the hurry?

04:57.130 --> 04:58.297
It's been two and a half years.

04:58.382 --> 05:00.174
I could have jumped
ship a hundred times.

05:00.258 --> 05:02.259
Is that supposed to persuade me?

05:05.222 --> 05:07.473
I have tremendous value
to this company.

05:07.557 --> 05:09.183
I'm aware of that.

05:09.267 --> 05:10.476
But I don't think you are.

05:10.560 --> 05:14.188
I am . I just hope you realize
that, the way things stand ,

05:14.272 --> 05:16.232
there will continue to be
someone senior to you .

05:16.316 --> 05:17.358
Why?

05:17.442 --> 05:19.235
What can they offer?

05:23.281 --> 05:26.158
All I'm asking is that you think about it.

05:26.243 --> 05:29.537
There are men younger than me
with this job at bigger firms.

05:31.790 --> 05:33.541
Cooper sign off on what's-his-name?

05:33.625 --> 05:34.667
Duck?

05:34.751 --> 05:36.711
I'll keep you posted .

05:47.305 --> 05:49.056
He's got a big lead .

05:49.141 --> 05:51.225
See you at the victory
party in the morning .

05:51.309 --> 05:52.226
Absolutely.

05:52.310 --> 05:54.311
Well , good night, Don .

05:56.523 --> 05:57.481
He's gone!

05:57.566 --> 05:59.442
Olly olly oxen free!

06:02.946 --> 06:04.155
- Do it.
- All rightie.

06:04.239 --> 06:06.198
- Who's got the cups?
- Oh . Sorry.

06:06.283 --> 06:09.035
With early returns just coming in,

06:09.119 --> 06:12.955
our NBC computer is putting
Senator Kennedy's odds for victory

06:13.040 --> 06:15.291
at a grim-sounding 22-1 .

06:20.589 --> 06:22.506
This is not good .

06:22.591 --> 06:24.258
And liquor stores are closed tonight.

06:24.342 --> 06:26.135
Draper has plenty of booze.

06:31.475 --> 06:33.184
We could ask her to join us.

06:33.268 --> 06:35.269
That might soften her up a bit.

06:35.353 --> 06:37.354
I have a bottle of absinthe in my office.

06:37.439 --> 06:38.564
Isn't that illegal?

06:38.648 --> 06:39.774
It's marvelous.

06:39.858 --> 06:41.817
I become incantatory.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.277
And what does that mean?

06:43.361 --> 06:45.237
It means he starts making up words.

06:45.322 --> 06:46.947
Can someone freshen this?

06:47.949 --> 06:50.659
We're not going to make it.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.995
Really?

06:54.372 --> 06:59.085
If I let you into that supply closet,
it is not going to be the sack of Rome.

06:59.169 --> 07:02.254
What do we have too much of?

07:02.339 --> 07:05.049
Rum , creme de menthe,

07:05.133 --> 07:06.383
dog biscuits.

07:13.391 --> 07:14.892
May the best man win .

07:14.976 --> 07:18.395
In matters national and . . .local .

07:21.399 --> 07:23.317
. . .majority decision of the American--

07:25.278 --> 07:26.737
I made my judgment long ago.

07:26.822 --> 07:29.323
Stop that. You're going to break it.

07:29.407 --> 07:32.076
Look. They're doing math .

07:32.160 --> 07:33.702
What do the numbers say?

07:33.787 --> 07:36.247
Who the president is going to be.

07:40.418 --> 07:41.585
Hello.

07:41.670 --> 07:44.130
Daddy! Hi!

07:47.384 --> 07:49.218
I wasn't expecting you .

07:49.302 --> 07:51.720
I thought you were going to be
watching returns at the office.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.347
What are you doing up?

07:53.431 --> 07:55.349
Mommy said it was okay.

07:55.433 --> 07:57.351
I'm watching the news.

07:57.435 --> 07:59.228
N ixon definitely won our precinct.

07:59.312 --> 08:00.521
You should have seen the line.

08:00.605 --> 08:03.232
Mommy said to ask you . What's the. . .

08:03.316 --> 08:05.359
Electoral College.

08:05.443 --> 08:10.489
I don't think that's a conversation
appropriate for children .

08:10.574 --> 08:12.116
Come here.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.828
Do you want something to eat?

08:15.912 --> 08:17.371
I'm going to fix a drink. You?

08:17.455 --> 08:18.998
I'm set.

08:21.209 --> 08:23.377
Senator Kennedy seems
to be closing the gap

08:23.461 --> 08:25.379
on the vice president's early lead .

08:25.463 --> 08:28.465
State-by-state, Ohio, lllinois--

08:31.303 --> 08:32.386
Come here.

08:32.470 --> 08:33.554
What?

08:33.638 --> 08:36.432
You better run .

08:36.516 --> 08:38.309
Go, Allison !

08:39.853 --> 08:40.811
White!

08:40.896 --> 08:42.313
Pink!

08:49.279 --> 08:51.405
You can tell me, or I can find out.

08:51.489 --> 08:52.698
What color panties are you wearing?

08:52.782 --> 08:54.617
What? Oh , my G--

08:59.164 --> 09:01.207
Blue!

09:01.291 --> 09:02.833
Who had blue?

09:07.505 --> 09:08.839
Can I walk you home?

09:15.347 --> 09:18.015
I used to think I'd find a husband here.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.601
I think I'm going to go home.

09:20.685 --> 09:23.103
No, don't go. It's going to be fun .

10:02.560 --> 10:05.062
What are you doing?

10:05.146 --> 10:06.480
Why aren't you asleep?

10:06.564 --> 10:07.773
What is that?

10:07.857 --> 10:09.566
Nothing .

10:11.278 --> 10:13.070
Myrna found it on the top of the closet,

10:13.154 --> 10:14.780
and I didn't want to look at it.

10:18.576 --> 10:20.494
My father has a box like that,

10:20.578 --> 10:23.247
and I looked at it when I was a little girl,

10:23.331 --> 10:24.498
and it was a mistake.

10:24.582 --> 10:26.417
So you didn't open it?

10:26.501 --> 10:29.545
Peter, I don't want secrets.

10:33.049 --> 10:34.383
I can't sleep.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.385
I know.

10:36.469 --> 10:39.638
I've seen it the last few weeks.

10:39.723 --> 10:41.265
You're not very quiet,

10:41.349 --> 10:43.392
and every time I see
the closet door is open

10:43.476 --> 10:45.269
and that box is gone,
I know you're out here.

10:45.353 --> 10:49.398
And you never looked in the box?

10:49.482 --> 10:51.567
It's not yours.

10:51.651 --> 10:52.985
What are you doing with it?

10:53.069 --> 10:54.361
I got it by mistake.

10:54.446 --> 10:56.322
So give it back.

10:56.406 --> 10:59.116
It's peculiar.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.201
It's not yours.

11:06.708 --> 11:08.375
Come to bed .

11:14.424 --> 11:16.550
Vice President Nixon
seems to have carried

11:16.634 --> 11:19.094
predominantly Catholic
Hudson County, New Jersey.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.888
Kinsey, you're a liar.

11:20.972 --> 11:23.265
I couldn't find any absinthe.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.059
Who said you could go in my office?

11:25.143 --> 11:27.144
We were exploring .

11:27.228 --> 11:30.939
But all we found was
a large collection ofMadmagazines

11:31.024 --> 11:35.069
and this fascinating dramatic piece.

11:35.153 --> 11:37.821
Death is My Client--Whoa.

11:37.906 --> 11:40.908
A play in one act by Paul Kinsey.

11:40.992 --> 11:42.117
Give it to me.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.621
"Peter Tollifson"--

11:46.664 --> 11:49.124
"An animal in the board room
and the bedroom ."

11:49.209 --> 11:50.626
- Kenny!
- Whoa!

11:52.670 --> 11:55.631
Now, remember, he's angry.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.466
Why do I have to play Tollifson?

11:57.550 --> 11:58.592
I wanted to be Galt.

11:58.676 --> 12:01.387
Tollifson is the hero. He thinks.

12:02.680 --> 12:05.599
Galt's a thug born on the wrong
side of the tracks.

12:05.683 --> 12:07.351
You don't want to be Galt.

12:10.772 --> 12:12.606
Go ahead .

12:12.690 --> 12:15.526
I'm sorry. I don't have the pages.

12:16.778 --> 12:19.071
Oh . Sorry.

12:19.155 --> 12:22.866
Um , "I worked with Tollifson for four years.

12:22.951 --> 12:25.244
I shared everything,
but I never knew him ."

12:25.328 --> 12:27.079
"I thought I knew him .

12:27.163 --> 12:29.206
He used to talk to me."

12:29.290 --> 12:31.125
"I can't control my genius.

12:31.209 --> 12:33.669
I'm not some boorish natural
like that hack Cosgrove."

12:37.674 --> 12:38.882
That's crackerjack, Kinsey.

12:40.885 --> 12:42.719
"Your genius be damned ."

12:42.804 --> 12:44.388
"Perhaps."

12:44.472 --> 12:46.557
"You can make anyone buy anything .

12:46.641 --> 12:49.059
Anyone but me."

13:25.763 --> 13:27.055
Turn the music down .

13:27.140 --> 13:29.349
We now have confirmation

13:29.434 --> 13:35.230
that the State of Ohio has indeed gone
to Vice President Richard Nixon .

13:35.315 --> 13:39.776
Its 25 electoral votes
will go in Mr. Nixon's purse.

13:53.124 --> 13:54.082
I'm--

13:54.167 --> 13:56.293
I'm really tipsy.

14:13.394 --> 14:14.895
I feel awful .

14:14.979 --> 14:18.690
No, no. Uh . . .it was me.

14:18.775 --> 14:21.777
I'm-- I'm drunk.

14:24.614 --> 14:28.617
I'm happy. . .but not myself.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.831
I've never really
seen your eyes before.

14:36.459 --> 14:38.794
There they are.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.255
Just the two of them .

14:54.227 --> 14:56.937
As Vice President Nixon's
home state of California

14:57.021 --> 14:58.772
continues to count ballots,

14:58.856 --> 15:01.316
both candidates bid
their supporters a good night.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.777
Vice presidential hopeful
Senator Lyndon Johnson

15:03.861 --> 15:05.862
had these words:

15:05.947 --> 15:08.782
l'm very proud of the manner

15:08.866 --> 15:10.534
in which the Democratic
campaign has been conducted

15:10.618 --> 15:12.494
and which the people have reacted,

15:12.579 --> 15:15.998
particularly in my state,
the entire South ,

15:16.082 --> 15:16.999
and in many states--

15:17.083 --> 15:18.500
What's going on?

15:18.585 --> 15:20.586
- I don't know.
- .. .feel, uh, very confident--

15:20.670 --> 15:21.795
It'll be all right in the morning .

15:21.879 --> 15:22.796
He'll win California.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.798
. . .the counting that--

15:24.882 --> 15:25.799
Turn it off.

15:25.883 --> 15:26.925
all Americans will be proud ,

15:27.010 --> 15:28.802
and I think we have
much to be proud of.

15:28.886 --> 15:31.138
I think this is one
of America's finest hours.

15:41.566 --> 15:42.816
Sit down .

15:42.900 --> 15:44.693
No.

15:46.154 --> 15:49.656
You can't sit down in that dress.

15:53.536 --> 15:57.039
You look so different
when you're drunk.

15:57.123 --> 15:59.708
You're not going to call me
Orson Welles again .

15:59.792 --> 16:00.834
You loved that.

16:00.918 --> 16:02.919
Who wouldn't like that?

16:08.259 --> 16:10.010
What did I do wrong?

16:12.555 --> 16:14.848
You have a big mouth .

16:14.932 --> 16:15.974
Joan , I never said--

16:16.059 --> 16:17.809
You have a big mouth .

16:21.856 --> 16:23.940
I do.

16:24.025 --> 16:25.901
I'm not proud of it.

16:28.404 --> 16:30.155
Did you like the play?

16:31.407 --> 16:32.658
No.

16:35.620 --> 16:39.456
The meaner you are, the more I like you .

16:39.540 --> 16:41.041
I know.

16:51.969 --> 16:54.513
Just like that?

16:54.597 --> 16:56.098
I thought we could dance.

17:09.987 --> 17:13.031
1 , 2, cha-cha-cha.

17:31.008 --> 17:33.468
Hildy, wake up.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.220
Mm , it's cold in here.

17:35.304 --> 17:37.764
It is. You have to get dressed .

17:51.028 --> 17:52.863
I can't find my glasses.

17:58.536 --> 18:00.662
That's too bad .

18:00.747 --> 18:02.581
Tremendous.

18:11.257 --> 18:12.799
Harry?

18:14.343 --> 18:15.469
Yes?

18:18.347 --> 18:20.432
I hope I didn't step on them .

18:26.689 --> 18:27.856
Damn it.

18:34.280 --> 18:37.407
There's an optometrist on Lexington.

18:37.492 --> 18:40.076
Great. Of course.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.715
I don't want you to be worried .

18:53.800 --> 18:56.343
It didn't mean anything , okay?

19:43.140 --> 19:44.516
You're not drinking for taste.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.142
Don't be such babies.

19:49.814 --> 19:51.064
Oh , God .

19:51.148 --> 19:54.067
It's definitely not helping .

19:54.151 --> 19:56.486
I'm sorry. Does it offend you?

20:03.202 --> 20:06.538
My shirt. And my mad money.
Who did this?

20:06.622 --> 20:08.832
I stole your blouse.

20:08.916 --> 20:11.042
I'm not joking . I had $3.00 in here.

20:11.127 --> 20:14.170
If I give you $3.00,
will you keep your voice down?

20:14.255 --> 20:16.506
You're animals.

20:16.591 --> 20:19.175
I'm reporting it to building security.

20:19.260 --> 20:22.971
Striking resemblance
to Broderick Crawford .

20:23.055 --> 20:25.765
Peggy Olsen, Highway Patrol .

20:36.193 --> 20:40.322
I've read three different newspapers
with three different results.

20:40.406 --> 20:42.115
I'm sure you know something I don't.

20:42.199 --> 20:47.120
Well, I just spent the night literally
in a smoke-filled room at The Waldorf

20:47.204 --> 20:52.042
with every Republican luminary
save MacArthur and Jesus.

20:52.126 --> 20:54.002
There's been widespread fraud .

20:54.086 --> 21:00.258
Daley gave Joe Kennedy
every corpse in Cook County.

21:00.343 --> 21:02.928
Otherwise, Nixon wins.

21:03.012 --> 21:05.138
It shouldn't have been that close.

21:05.222 --> 21:07.140
But it is. It always is.

21:07.224 --> 21:10.143
Those jingles.

21:10.227 --> 21:12.562
When they got Frank Sinatra,

21:12.647 --> 21:14.147
I knew they would close the gap.

21:14.231 --> 21:16.942
So what does he do now?

21:17.026 --> 21:18.193
Walk away? Concede?

21:18.277 --> 21:22.280
A recount in Illinois alone
means 30 days without a president.

21:22.365 --> 21:24.157
You don't want to win like that.

21:24.241 --> 21:26.201
But you want to win.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.787
He got 50% of the vote, maybe more.

21:28.871 --> 21:30.705
This way he lives to see another day.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.958
So. . .what happens?

21:33.042 --> 21:38.421
Neil from P&G said if Kennedy
is willing to buy an election,

21:38.506 --> 21:42.175
he's probably willing to play ball with us.

21:42.259 --> 21:44.511
Ah, the optimism
of the American corporation .

21:44.595 --> 21:46.429
It's a football game to them .

21:46.514 --> 21:47.806
Doesn't seem fair.

21:47.890 --> 21:48.890
Fair?

21:50.559 --> 21:52.268
Very good .

22:00.152 --> 22:02.278
Where do you think you're going?

22:02.363 --> 22:03.613
If I were you ,

22:03.698 --> 22:05.281
I would be very,
very careful from now on

22:05.366 --> 22:07.283
about the way you speak to me.

22:12.248 --> 22:13.873
Can I help you?

22:16.293 --> 22:17.210
What's that?

22:17.294 --> 22:18.962
It's yours.

22:19.046 --> 22:21.381
It came to me by mistake.

22:21.465 --> 22:22.757
Well, thanks.

22:24.301 --> 22:26.177
Have you reconsidered
my qualifications

22:26.262 --> 22:28.138
for the head of account services?

22:28.222 --> 22:31.558
Would it disappoint you
if I told you it hadn't crossed my mind?

22:48.200 --> 22:50.827
I feel strange having
to talk to you in this way.

22:53.789 --> 22:55.373
Spit it out, Campbell .

22:57.126 --> 22:59.919
I know that your name
is not Donald Draper.

23:00.004 --> 23:02.338
It's Dick Whitman .

23:08.804 --> 23:11.264
I don't know who Donald Draper is,

23:11.348 --> 23:14.476
but according to my friend Russ
at the Department of Defense,

23:14.560 --> 23:17.103
Dick Whitman died in Korea in 1 950,

23:17.188 --> 23:19.355
and Donald Draper dropped off the map.

23:19.440 --> 23:21.024
Although he's 43 years old ,

23:21.108 --> 23:23.485
in which case
you look remarkably good .

23:25.112 --> 23:26.321
That's kind of elaborate.

23:26.405 --> 23:28.406
Really?

23:28.491 --> 23:31.117
I wish I knew more.

23:31.202 --> 23:32.786
I bet a lot of people do.

23:34.371 --> 23:36.247
Pete. . .

23:36.332 --> 23:37.415
get out.

23:37.500 --> 23:39.084
You're making a fool of yourself.

23:39.168 --> 23:42.003
You can deny it.

23:42.088 --> 23:43.463
But I know it's true.

23:43.547 --> 23:44.964
I can see from your face.

23:47.384 --> 23:48.885
You should leave.

23:48.969 --> 23:51.137
Don . . .

23:51.222 --> 23:54.099
you should think about
how Bert Cooper will react

23:54.183 --> 23:55.475
when he hears this information .

23:55.559 --> 23:56.518
What information?

23:56.602 --> 23:59.479
You're not who you say you are,

23:59.563 --> 24:02.315
and there's obviously a reason .

24:02.399 --> 24:04.317
Come on .

24:04.401 --> 24:09.405
I would like you
to reconsider my qualifications.

24:24.046 --> 24:25.880
You said everything except "or else."

24:28.676 --> 24:33.012
Assuming this information
is true, which it isn't,

24:33.097 --> 24:35.348
it sounds to me like
you're blackmailing me.

24:35.432 --> 24:36.808
I'm not.

24:38.435 --> 24:44.190
I'm hoping you'll realize
that this all can be forgotten .

24:46.360 --> 24:49.154
It's not like you're a deserter, is it?

24:49.238 --> 24:52.198
When you threaten someone
in this manner,

24:52.283 --> 24:54.242
you should be aware of the fact

24:54.326 --> 24:56.119
that if your information
is powerful enough

24:56.203 --> 24:58.121
to make them do what you want. . .

25:00.457 --> 25:02.458
what else can it make them do?

25:03.627 --> 25:04.752
It's very simple.

25:04.837 --> 25:07.881
And it's not a threat. It's just a job.

25:10.467 --> 25:13.219
Think about it.

25:59.016 --> 26:00.433
Whitman.

26:05.522 --> 26:06.564
Yes, Sergeant.

26:08.525 --> 26:11.069
What is this?

26:11.153 --> 26:12.862
This is it.

26:14.365 --> 26:16.199
One? I'm supposed to have 20.

26:16.283 --> 26:19.410
This is going to take a month,
and it should take 48 hours.

26:19.495 --> 26:21.955
Well, you're whining to the wrong guy, sir.

26:39.556 --> 26:40.682
At ease.

26:43.018 --> 26:45.186
Uh , this is for officers.

26:45.271 --> 26:46.688
You can bunk next door.

26:46.772 --> 26:48.773
I-I'd introduce you to the men,

26:48.857 --> 26:52.485
but you're looking
at the complete company.

26:52.569 --> 26:53.903
Where is everybody, sir?

26:53.988 --> 26:56.531
They were gone when I got here.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.491
I'm an engineer.

26:58.575 --> 27:00.702
They're in some action
5 miles over that mountain .

27:00.786 --> 27:02.537
You want to go?

27:02.621 --> 27:05.081
The answer is no.

27:06.583 --> 27:08.418
The locals stopped
showing up three days ago,

27:08.502 --> 27:10.545
which , by the way, is not good .

27:10.629 --> 27:13.214
You're going to be doing all the digging .

27:13.299 --> 27:14.507
Digging what?

27:14.591 --> 27:17.552
Well, this unit-- that's you--

27:17.636 --> 27:20.430
will be establishing a field hospital,

27:20.514 --> 27:24.767
but first we're going to be digging
fighting positions on four sides.

27:27.604 --> 27:30.398
What are you doing here?
Are you poor?

27:30.482 --> 27:32.150
I volunteered .

27:32.234 --> 27:34.402
You're kidding me.

27:34.486 --> 27:36.529
Well, they got me with college.

27:38.991 --> 27:41.743
But I'm three years,
six months nearly a civilian .

27:41.827 --> 27:46.122
I'm supposed to be building
swimming pools, not latrines.

27:46.206 --> 27:47.832
You any good with that rifle?

27:47.916 --> 27:50.418
I wouldn't want you
to mistake me for Chinese.

27:50.502 --> 27:53.212
As much practice as I've had, yes.

27:57.009 --> 27:59.135
What misconception
traveled down the road

27:59.219 --> 28:00.720
and made you want to be here?

28:00.804 --> 28:01.721
A movie?

28:01.805 --> 28:04.349
No. I just wanted to leave.

28:04.433 --> 28:07.977
I'll bet you're reconsidering
if this was a step up.

28:40.302 --> 28:41.552
Miss Menken,

28:41.637 --> 28:44.180
Mr. Draper is here to see you .

28:46.058 --> 28:47.809
Please hold my calls.

29:00.989 --> 29:03.658
Did you run over? You're flushed .

29:14.711 --> 29:17.422
Let's go away.

29:17.506 --> 29:19.257
Really? Where?

29:19.341 --> 29:20.633
Anywhere.

29:20.717 --> 29:22.427
Warmer weather?

29:22.511 --> 29:24.637
Sure.

29:24.721 --> 29:26.013
How about Los Angeles?

29:26.098 --> 29:28.391
Mexico? I have money.

29:28.475 --> 29:31.227
I have money, but I have a store to run.

29:34.773 --> 29:37.650
Don , are you well?

29:37.734 --> 29:39.277
No, I'm not.

29:39.361 --> 29:42.655
Did something else happen to Roger?

29:42.739 --> 29:44.657
No.

29:44.741 --> 29:47.660
Something happened , and . . .

29:47.744 --> 29:49.912
I want to go, and I want you
to come with me,

29:49.997 --> 29:52.123
and I don't want to come back.

29:52.207 --> 29:53.332
What happened?

29:53.417 --> 29:56.419
What does it matter?
Isn't this what you want?

29:58.005 --> 30:01.674
Of course. I've thought about it.

30:01.758 --> 30:04.302
My God , we've talked about it.

30:04.386 --> 30:05.678
I just--

30:05.762 --> 30:08.473
I just didn't think it would happen--

30:08.557 --> 30:10.766
I mean , especially this way.

30:12.769 --> 30:16.439
I just. . .don't want to be without you ,

30:16.523 --> 30:18.774
and I don't want to be here.

30:18.859 --> 30:20.818
I can't just leave.

30:26.033 --> 30:27.492
Maybe this weekend--

30:27.576 --> 30:28.576
Rachel .

30:37.794 --> 30:39.795
No. This isn't how
I thought it would be.

30:39.880 --> 30:41.380
What is the difference?

30:41.465 --> 30:43.549
We'll go somewhere else.

30:43.634 --> 30:45.593
We'll start over like Adam and Eve.

30:45.677 --> 30:48.095
What, are you 1 5 years old?

30:48.180 --> 30:49.931
My father--

30:50.015 --> 30:51.724
Can't we be together here?

30:51.808 --> 30:53.059
There's nothing here.

30:54.728 --> 30:56.270
What about your children?

30:56.355 --> 30:59.106
I'll provide for them .

30:59.191 --> 31:01.442
And live in Los Angeles?

31:02.653 --> 31:06.113
My God , you haven't
thought this through.

31:06.198 --> 31:07.740
I feel sick.

31:07.824 --> 31:09.617
You're wrong. I know exactly what I want.

31:09.701 --> 31:11.994
You want your children
to go on without a father?

31:12.079 --> 31:13.538
You know how that felt.

31:13.622 --> 31:15.665
Are you having an attack
of conscience after all this?

31:15.749 --> 31:18.125
No. I'm watching you talk

31:18.210 --> 31:20.127
because I feel I don't know you .

31:21.838 --> 31:24.840
You know more about me
than anyone.

31:24.925 --> 31:27.677
You won't even tell me what happened .

31:33.141 --> 31:35.893
Why are you doing this to me?

31:35.978 --> 31:38.771
What kind of man are you?

31:38.855 --> 31:42.858
Go away, drop everything , leave your life?

31:42.943 --> 31:44.860
People do it every day.

31:47.447 --> 31:51.033
- This was a dalliance, a cheap affair.
- Rachel , don't.

31:51.118 --> 31:52.702
You don't want to run away with me.

31:52.786 --> 31:54.787
You just want to run away.

31:55.872 --> 31:57.873
You're a coward .

32:01.253 --> 32:03.671
Please go now.

32:05.882 --> 32:07.383
Get out.

32:44.212 --> 32:45.630
Peggy, this is my office.

32:45.714 --> 32:46.839
Does this door mean nothing to you?

32:46.923 --> 32:48.674
I'm sorry, Mr. Draper.

32:48.759 --> 32:50.343
I didn't know you were coming back. I just--

32:54.556 --> 32:56.098
I just--

33:02.689 --> 33:04.106
Calm down .

33:08.528 --> 33:10.821
Stop it.

33:10.906 --> 33:13.449
I didn't mean to yell at you .

33:13.533 --> 33:16.118
Got to be some semblance
of privacy left here.

33:17.954 --> 33:20.665
I had to get away from them all
for a minute.

33:24.127 --> 33:25.544
Drink this.

33:34.846 --> 33:40.393
Sonny from the elevator
and some janitor-- I don't know his name--

33:40.477 --> 33:42.186
they got fired .

33:42.270 --> 33:44.355
That's why you're crying?

33:44.439 --> 33:46.899
It was my fault.

33:46.983 --> 33:48.943
I called security.

33:50.987 --> 33:52.571
They weren't even here last night.

33:55.784 --> 33:57.326
Peggy, I need to be alone right now.

33:57.411 --> 34:03.708
I know.

34:05.836 --> 34:08.045
I don't understand .

34:08.130 --> 34:10.756
I try to do my job.

34:10.841 --> 34:12.925
I follow the rules,

34:13.009 --> 34:15.678
and people hate me.

34:15.762 --> 34:19.056
Innocent people get hurt, and--

34:19.141 --> 34:21.726
and other people--

34:21.810 --> 34:24.603
people who are not good--

34:24.688 --> 34:27.356
get to walk around
doing whatever they want.

34:29.234 --> 34:30.818
It's not fair.

34:34.030 --> 34:35.030
Finish it.

35:19.075 --> 35:21.118
I've thought about what you said .

35:21.203 --> 35:23.537
Glad to hear it.

35:23.622 --> 35:25.414
And then I thought about you

35:25.499 --> 35:28.042
and what a deep lack
of character you have.

35:33.673 --> 35:35.674
I can understand your frustration , Don .

35:35.759 --> 35:37.843
Believe me, I'm not enjoying this
any more than you are.

35:37.928 --> 35:39.553
I'm hiring Duck Phillips.

35:41.097 --> 35:42.473
Don . . .

35:43.600 --> 35:45.017
don't make me go to Cooper.

35:45.101 --> 35:46.977
I'm not making you do anything .

35:47.062 --> 35:48.979
You haven't thought this through .

35:49.064 --> 35:50.564
- I have.
- Really?

35:50.649 --> 35:53.943
You're just going to go up to the office
and tell Bert Cooper.

35:54.027 --> 35:56.028
If I have to. I don't want to.

35:56.112 --> 35:57.613
Let me ask you .

35:57.697 --> 36:01.408
How do you think he'll react
when you tell him this story of yours?

36:01.493 --> 36:04.620
You expect him to promote you
after the way you've behaved?

36:04.704 --> 36:06.288
I think he'll appreciate the loyalty.

36:06.373 --> 36:09.124
You haven't thought this through .

36:11.545 --> 36:13.754
I don't know.

36:13.839 --> 36:16.465
But I'm pretty sure
you won't be working here anymore.

36:29.187 --> 36:31.063
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

36:31.147 --> 36:33.065
I'm going to take care of this right now.

36:33.149 --> 36:34.567
Is this like in the movies
where I have a gun

36:34.651 --> 36:36.068
and you don't think
I'm going to shoot you?

36:36.152 --> 36:37.361
I will shoot you .

36:37.445 --> 36:39.071
I won't let you hold this over my head .

36:39.155 --> 36:42.157
So you'd rather blow yourself up
than make me head of accounts.

36:53.169 --> 36:54.795
Why can't you give me what I want?

36:54.880 --> 36:56.088
I've earned this job. I deserve it.

36:56.172 --> 36:58.048
Why? Because your parents are rich?

36:58.133 --> 37:01.719
Because you went to prep school
and have a $5.00 haircut?

37:01.803 --> 37:03.095
You've been given everything .

37:03.179 --> 37:05.097
You've never worked
for anything in your life.

37:05.181 --> 37:08.142
For gosh sakes, don't you realize
you're going to lose everything?

37:08.226 --> 37:10.102
I'm giving you a way out.

37:10.186 --> 37:11.604
Would it be so bad?

37:11.688 --> 37:13.856
Why is this so hard for you?

37:25.744 --> 37:27.828
You're really going to do this?

37:33.752 --> 37:36.003
More bad news?

37:36.087 --> 37:38.130
If you came here
to drown your sorrows,

37:38.214 --> 37:40.132
I'm not really much of a drinker.

37:40.216 --> 37:42.176
No. I just wanted to say--

37:43.929 --> 37:45.429
I'm pulling the trigger
on Duck Phillips

37:45.513 --> 37:47.139
as new head of account services.

37:47.223 --> 37:50.601
Oh , good . Well done.

38:00.862 --> 38:01.862
What?

38:04.240 --> 38:07.534
I have to bring this up to you .

38:07.619 --> 38:10.162
Only because I believe
if I kept it from you

38:10.246 --> 38:12.581
in the end it would be
damaging to Sterling Cooper.

38:13.792 --> 38:16.669
It has come to my attention,
completely by accident,

38:16.753 --> 38:19.630
that Donald Draper here
is not who he says he is.

38:19.714 --> 38:22.883
His real name is Dick Whitman ,

38:22.968 --> 38:27.096
but. . . Dick Whitman
died in Korea ten years ago.

38:27.180 --> 38:32.851
It stands to reason
that he is a deserter at the very least

38:32.936 --> 38:34.269
and who knows what else.

38:58.294 --> 39:01.255
Mr. Campbell, who cares?

39:03.758 --> 39:04.758
What?

39:04.843 --> 39:06.343
Who cares?

39:06.428 --> 39:09.263
Mr. Cooper, he's a fraud and a liar.

39:09.347 --> 39:10.472
A criminal, even.

39:12.058 --> 39:14.226
Even if this were true, who cares?

39:14.310 --> 39:18.147
This country was built and run
by men with worse stories

39:18.231 --> 39:20.232
than whatever you've imagined here.

39:20.316 --> 39:22.651
I'm not imagining anything .

39:27.490 --> 39:29.616
The Japanese have a saying :

39:29.701 --> 39:32.494
a man is whatever room he is in ,

39:32.579 --> 39:37.249
and right now Donald Draper
is in this room .

39:37.333 --> 39:39.668
I assure you ,

39:39.753 --> 39:43.714
there's more profit in forgetting this.

39:43.798 --> 39:46.508
I'd put your energy
into bringing in accounts.

39:56.686 --> 39:58.187
Don,

39:58.271 --> 40:01.648
fire him if you want.

40:01.733 --> 40:05.277
But I'd keep an eye on him .

40:05.361 --> 40:09.031
One never knows how loyalty is born .

40:32.514 --> 40:33.514
Shit!

40:36.392 --> 40:37.434
Sir, what do we do?

40:37.519 --> 40:38.477
Keep your head .

40:38.561 --> 40:39.478
Don't shoot at anything

40:39.562 --> 40:41.063
unless it shoots at you first.

40:44.109 --> 40:46.527
What? What? What?

40:46.611 --> 40:48.278
Shut up! Just stay down!

40:48.363 --> 40:49.363
Shit!

40:49.447 --> 40:51.240
Don't they know this is a hospital?

40:51.324 --> 40:53.617
We're nuts if they know that.

41:04.295 --> 41:05.295
Is it over?

41:05.380 --> 41:06.505
I don't know.

41:21.896 --> 41:23.689
- You think they'll be back?
- I don't know.

41:23.773 --> 41:25.774
We didn't shoot back. That helps.

41:31.447 --> 41:32.447
You pissed yourself.

41:34.033 --> 41:35.742
What?

41:35.827 --> 41:37.244
Did I?

41:39.455 --> 41:40.747
Crap.

42:07.150 --> 42:09.818
How are we doing , Lieutenant Draper?

42:18.369 --> 42:21.455
On behalf of the President
of the U nited States

42:21.539 --> 42:24.499
and the citizens
of the United States of America. . .

42:27.587 --> 42:31.423
I present you with
this Purple Heart medal .

42:31.507 --> 42:33.258
The concussion was minor.

42:33.343 --> 42:35.510
You'll feel like yourself in a week.

42:40.391 --> 42:43.727
The colonel here
has some good news for you .

42:43.811 --> 42:46.813
We're releasing you to the Reserves
for your last 80 days.

42:46.898 --> 42:48.815
You're going home.

42:56.115 --> 42:59.284
That's good news.
You're going to be okay.

43:05.333 --> 43:06.875
Lieutenant Draper,

43:06.960 --> 43:08.794
Private Whitman .

43:08.878 --> 43:12.047
You were the last person who knew him
in his chain of command .

43:12.131 --> 43:14.549
We'd like you to take him home.

43:16.678 --> 43:19.263
I think it would mean something .

43:25.353 --> 43:27.312
Lieutenant Nelson , how you doing?

43:31.567 --> 43:33.610
On behalf of the President
of the U nited States

43:33.695 --> 43:35.779
and the citizens of
the U nited States of America--

43:43.579 --> 43:44.955
Bunbury.

43:48.668 --> 43:50.502
This is us, Lieutenant.

44:18.906 --> 44:20.574
Lieutenant Draper?

44:22.869 --> 44:24.619
Just go.

44:26.581 --> 44:27.998
I can't.

44:30.209 --> 44:31.960
Okay.

44:43.348 --> 44:44.848
There he is! I see him !

44:44.932 --> 44:46.308
Who?

44:46.392 --> 44:47.726
Dick. He's on the train .

44:47.810 --> 44:48.727
I see him .

44:48.811 --> 44:50.562
No, he's right here.

44:50.646 --> 44:52.272
But I saw him .

44:52.357 --> 44:53.440
I saw him in the window over there.

44:53.524 --> 44:56.568
Stop it. No more of that.

44:56.652 --> 45:00.113
It must be hard for you .

45:00.198 --> 45:01.573
Did you know him?

45:04.369 --> 45:05.535
A little.

45:05.620 --> 45:08.163
You got your whole life ahead of you .

45:08.247 --> 45:09.790
Forget that boy in the box.

45:13.836 --> 45:15.379
Look at you .

45:16.672 --> 45:19.091
Let me buy a soldier a drink.

45:28.684 --> 45:29.935
Dick!

46:19.902 --> 46:24.656
With that, I want to say again

46:24.740 --> 46:28.618
my deep thanks
to all of you who are here

46:28.703 --> 46:32.122
and those who have listened
on television and radio,

46:32.206 --> 46:36.293
and again my congratulations
to Senator Kennedy

46:36.377 --> 46:39.212
for his fine race in this campaign ,

46:39.297 --> 46:41.756
and to all of you--

46:44.135 --> 46:45.343
I am sure--

46:45.428 --> 46:46.678
I am sure his supporters

46:46.762 --> 46:48.597
are just as enthusiastic
as you are for me,

46:48.681 --> 46:50.557
and l thank you for that.

47:43.027 --> 47:46.029
