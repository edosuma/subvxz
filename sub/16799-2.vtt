WEBVTT

00:08.770 --> 00:11.603
I know it's not much,
but the price is right.

00:12.780 --> 00:14.133
You just have to agree
(opens fridge)

00:14.180 --> 00:15.807
to keep the common areas clean,
and do some

00:15.840 --> 00:17.546
small repairs
for the residents.
(closes fridge)

00:17.580 --> 00:20.276
So, um, the landlord know about
my record, right?

00:20.320 --> 00:21.673
That I'm on parole?

00:21.720 --> 00:23.142
Yeah. He does.

00:23.190 --> 00:24.543
He and my sister

00:24.590 --> 00:26.410
are friends,
and she vouched for you.

00:26.460 --> 00:27.813
She don't even know me.

00:27.860 --> 00:29.282
I know you.

00:29.330 --> 00:31.628
Simple as that?

00:31.660 --> 00:33.389
Sometimes.

00:36.130 --> 00:38.189
So, what do you think?

00:38.230 --> 00:41.199
Mm. Wondering if I...

00:41.240 --> 00:43.208
should hold out for a view.

00:43.240 --> 00:44.468
(chuckles softly)

00:44.510 --> 00:47.104
Maybe a pool?

00:47.140 --> 00:48.573
I mean,

00:48.610 --> 00:50.248
it isn't a halfway house,

00:50.280 --> 00:53.340
and (sighs),
that's all that matters.

00:55.150 --> 00:57.380
You have to be patient.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.482
It's like recovering
from multiple gunshot wounds.

01:01.520 --> 01:03.681
You don't just go from
rebuilding your organs

01:03.730 --> 01:06.358
to... running
a marathon overnight.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.550
It's a process.
Takes time.

01:08.600 --> 01:11.660
It's slow and painful,
but you'll get there.

01:12.870 --> 01:15.464
If you say it, Doc,
I believe it.

01:30.520 --> 01:32.818
We got the Chele you wanted.

01:32.860 --> 01:34.509
(light rustling in trunk)

01:36.730 --> 01:39.255
(sighs)

01:45.170 --> 01:47.468
(panﬁng)

01:50.310 --> 01:52.574
You're not gonna kill me.

01:52.610 --> 01:54.601
(sighs)

01:54.640 --> 01:56.369
What makes you think that,
Holmes?

01:56.410 --> 01:59.743
Are you calling me by my name,
or is that short for...?

02:02.450 --> 02:04.509
After my abduction,
I tracked the movements

02:04.550 --> 02:06.609
of this, uh,
appalling conveyance.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.912
We passed at least three

02:08.960 --> 02:11.349
much more suitable sites
for an execution,

02:11.390 --> 02:13.790
and one of them is favored
by your gang, Mara Tres.

02:13.830 --> 02:16.663
You are Halcon Zelaya.

02:16.700 --> 02:19.498
You are the leader of
the Mara Tres New York branch,

02:19.540 --> 02:22.407
and you are a man
who does not mess around,

02:22.440 --> 02:24.499
so if I'm standing here
face-to-face with you,

02:24.540 --> 02:26.804
and I'm alive, then...

02:26.840 --> 02:30.276
you have something in mind for
me other than a shallow grave.

02:30.310 --> 02:32.642
Bring him.

02:32.680 --> 02:35.171
Move, Chele.

02:49.470 --> 02:50.892
Friends of yours?

02:52.340 --> 02:53.967
These three are mine.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.436
He is Reymundo Torres.

02:57.470 --> 02:59.529
Goes by "Rey."

02:59.580 --> 03:01.935
This was his place of business.

03:01.980 --> 03:03.504
Smuggler?

03:03.550 --> 03:06.474
He brought things
into this country for me.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.909
Things that I need
for my business.

03:08.950 --> 03:11.942
Now... my business will hurt.

03:13.620 --> 03:15.952
Someone is gonna die for this.

03:15.990 --> 03:17.526
They're gonna
die ugly

03:17.560 --> 03:19.824
and slow, and you...

03:19.860 --> 03:22.328
are gonna find them for us.

03:24.430 --> 03:26.591
We don't want to kill you,
Holmes.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.631
We want to hire you.

03:30.270 --> 03:31.259
*

03:43.050 --> 03:45.484
_ Your men _were
inCIdental Victims.

03:45.520 --> 03:48.580
The primary target
was Rey Torres.

03:48.620 --> 03:51.885
Before he was shot, he was
pistol-whipped repeatedly.

03:51.930 --> 03:55.422
All so he would divulge
the location of...

03:57.930 --> 04:00.831
...this.

04:00.870 --> 04:02.462
(unit rumbling)

04:06.840 --> 04:08.330
(sighs)

04:08.380 --> 04:10.701
Smuggler's cache.

04:15.780 --> 04:17.645
It looks empty.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.812
Ah.

04:21.860 --> 04:23.953
But at some point,
it contained...

04:23.990 --> 04:26.493
amongst other things probably,

04:26.530 --> 04:27.690
a quantity of

04:27.730 --> 04:29.823
crystal methamphetamine.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.497
So who did it?

04:31.530 --> 04:33.839
There were_five
or more assailants.

04:33.870 --> 04:36.759
Probable military
background.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.368
Given the fact
that they raided

04:38.410 --> 04:40.469
his cache, I would say...

04:40.510 --> 04:43.001
might have been sent
by a rival smuggler.

04:43.050 --> 04:44.904
So how long
till you can give me a name?

04:44.950 --> 04:47.919
I don't know,
but more importantly,

04:47.950 --> 04:50.646
not yet inclined to do so.

04:50.690 --> 04:52.885
Thought you were smart, Holmes.

04:52.920 --> 04:54.911
This isn't a job
you get to say "no" to.

04:54.960 --> 04:57.588
Do it, or you and that
chinita you work with are dead.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.450
You know,

04:59.500 --> 05:03.061
I understand the "stick" part
of the carrot-stick equation,

05:03.100 --> 05:06.399
but if I'm gonna conduct
an investigation,

05:06.440 --> 05:08.965
you're gonna have
to let me go, and...

05:09.000 --> 05:11.400
my partner and I will be able
to escape your grasp,

05:11.440 --> 05:12.805
so,

05:12.840 --> 05:14.432
your stick is insufficient.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.802
You have to provide a carrot,
as well.

05:17.850 --> 05:19.545
Grand a day?

05:19.580 --> 05:20.842
I don't want your money.

05:20.880 --> 05:22.484
I suggest

05:22.520 --> 05:23.680
a quid pro quo.

05:23.720 --> 05:24.641
What do you want?

05:24.690 --> 05:25.839
Same as you.

05:25.890 --> 05:27.915
A name.

05:27.960 --> 05:29.985
Someone's been selling heroin
laced with fentanyl.

05:30.030 --> 05:32.021
Very potent, very deadly.

05:32.060 --> 05:35.791
12 people have died so far,
including a woman I knew.

05:35.830 --> 05:38.128
So you want to know
who is selling it?

05:38.170 --> 05:41.731
You struck me as a man who keeps
an eye on his competition.

05:41.770 --> 05:44.034
You help me find
who killed my friend,

05:44.070 --> 05:46.379
I'll help you find
who killed yours.

05:47.940 --> 05:50.408
WATSON: You agreed to work
for a drug dealer?

05:50.450 --> 05:53.817
In exchange for the name of
another drug dealer, yes.

05:53.850 --> 05:55.875
They kidnapped you.
We should bring in Major Crimes,

05:55.920 --> 05:57.615
tell them about the warehouse.
It's in Newark.

05:57.650 --> 05:59.049
It's out of their
jurisdiction. Additionally,

05:59.090 --> 06:01.479
according to the news,
a warehouse fire broke out

06:01.520 --> 06:02.828
near the Oak Island Rail Yard

06:02.860 --> 06:04.828
shortly after my
departure from the scene.

06:04.860 --> 06:06.623
The good news is,
solving these murders

06:06.660 --> 06:08.924
may help unravel several other
criminal enterprises.

06:08.960 --> 06:11.428
In addition to yielding a
source of poisoned heroin,

06:11.470 --> 06:13.836
it would expose what is left
of Rey Torres' smuggling network

06:13.870 --> 06:15.531
and reveal his killers,

06:15.570 --> 06:17.902
who I'm sure are quite heinous
in their own right.

06:17.940 --> 06:21.103
So heinous that you would have
this Halcon guy kill them?

06:21.140 --> 06:24.644
Yeah. Well, we'll blow up
that bridge when we come to it.

06:29.750 --> 06:31.581
Is that live
footage?
Yeah.

06:31.620 --> 06:34.418
I'm owed a favor by the owner
of a local helicopter service.

06:34.460 --> 06:35.882
He's deployed several
of his helicopters

06:35.920 --> 06:37.182
to scan the waterfront for us.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.822
Are you gonna tell me why?

06:38.860 --> 06:40.521
How was your meeting
with Shinwell last night?

06:40.560 --> 06:42.027
Good, basically.

06:42.060 --> 06:43.561
He's gonna take the apartment.

06:43.600 --> 06:44.897
He's meeting me here at noon

06:44.930 --> 06:46.739
to sign some papers
that Lin sent over.

06:46.770 --> 06:47.998
But?

06:48.040 --> 06:50.463
Well, he's still having
a tough time adjusting.

06:50.510 --> 06:53.877
Well, in his former life, he was
a lieutenant in a drug gang,

06:53.910 --> 06:56.902
a position which afforded him
ample money and prestige.

06:56.950 --> 07:00.977
Now he has neither,
so he's craving what he lost.

07:01.020 --> 07:03.818
You want to tell me why we're
looking at a bunch of boats?

07:03.850 --> 07:06.717
Last night, I saw a...

07:06.760 --> 07:09.558
shoepnnt
in some dust.

07:09.590 --> 07:11.581
Perhaps you recognize it

07:11.630 --> 07:15.122
from my monograph of
shoe treads of the world.

07:15.160 --> 07:17.219
It was, uh, required reading
during your apprenticeship.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.897
That was over four years ago.

07:21.640 --> 07:24.108
Korean?

07:24.140 --> 07:26.199
North Korean,
and that's important.

07:26.240 --> 07:28.105
_ In order to evade
his national sanctions,

07:28.140 --> 07:30.938
the North Koreans
have become excellent smugglers.

07:30.980 --> 07:32.242
Just the kind of people

07:32.280 --> 07:34.145
that would come into conflict
with Rey Torres.

07:34.180 --> 07:36.717
Mm. I also found
traces of crystal meth

07:36.750 --> 07:38.843
in Torres'
smuggling cache.

07:38.890 --> 07:40.812
The shade in color
match crystal meth

07:40.860 --> 07:42.748
manufactured in North Korea.

07:42.790 --> 07:44.849
So we're looking
for a smuggling ship.

07:44.890 --> 07:47.495
Mm. Most smugglers
register their ships

07:47.530 --> 07:50.169
in countries of origin
other than their own to avoid

07:50.200 --> 07:53.499
scrutiny. Obviously,
the North Koreans favor the flag

07:53.540 --> 07:56.134
of the tiny Polynesian nation
of Tuvalu,

07:56.170 --> 07:57.967
which features a Union Jack.

07:58.010 --> 08:00.729
It's a light blue field
and a spray of stars.

08:00.780 --> 08:02.509
Okay. So now what?

08:02.550 --> 08:04.677
I confess everything.

08:04.710 --> 08:06.268
All crimes involving

08:06.310 --> 08:08.813
my ship, but I did it on my own.

08:08.850 --> 08:10.181
No one else
was involved.

08:10.220 --> 08:11.847
What about the murder
of Rey Torres?

08:11.890 --> 08:13.209
Do that on your own, too?

08:13.260 --> 08:15.285
Yes, just me. I shot him.

08:15.320 --> 08:17.083
GREGSON:
Our consultant here

08:17.130 --> 08:19.928
tells me there were
at least five attackers.

08:19.960 --> 08:22.497
So, who helped you?

08:24.000 --> 08:25.592
What kind of gun did you use?

08:25.630 --> 08:28.895
A type 70 pistol.
I throw it in the bay.

08:28.940 --> 08:30.202
Wrong caliber.

08:30.240 --> 08:31.935
Additionally,
Mr. Torres was pistol-whipped.

08:31.970 --> 08:34.074
The blows indicate that
the assailant was much taller

08:34.110 --> 08:37.045
than you, and left-handed,
and you're right-handed.
Please.

08:37.080 --> 08:40.243
I'||_ confess
everything you want.

08:40.280 --> 08:43.647
I cannot implicate my employers.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.282
They'll hurt my family.

08:45.320 --> 08:47.083
HOLMES:
We want the
truth, Captain.

08:47.120 --> 08:49.054
You appear to be innocent
of Rey Torres'

08:49.090 --> 08:51.251
murder, but you or one
of your crew members

08:51.290 --> 08:53.053
left a shoeprint
at his warehouse.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.625
So, why were you there,
and what happened?

08:55.660 --> 08:58.322
Rey did not like competition.

08:58.370 --> 09:00.634
So this was
about the meth.

09:00.670 --> 09:04.060
Last time I came to New York,
he told me not to come back.

09:04.110 --> 09:05.338
But my employers

09:05.370 --> 09:07.679
don't care. I made
port last week.

09:07.710 --> 09:10.941
The next night, Torres
and his men raided my ship,

09:10.980 --> 09:12.208
took my meth.

09:12.250 --> 09:13.877
And that was not all.

09:13.920 --> 09:17.139
They broke into my safe
and took what was inside.

09:17.190 --> 09:19.044
Which was?

09:19.090 --> 09:21.888
A box, a locked metal box

09:21.920 --> 09:25.219
given to me by a very
important person at home.

09:25.260 --> 09:26.898
Party official?

09:26.930 --> 09:28.227
He wouldn't tell
me the contents

09:28.260 --> 09:29.966
of the box.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.231
He ordered me to wait
for the delivery instructions.

09:33.270 --> 09:34.828
I had to get it back.

09:34.870 --> 09:36.804
Torres had many

09:36.840 --> 09:39.035
warehouses, many offices.

09:39.070 --> 09:40.935
It took a week to find
out where he kept it.

09:40.980 --> 09:44.074
But he was dead
when we got there.

09:44.110 --> 09:46.203
Whoever killed him
left our meth,

09:46.250 --> 09:47.774
so we took that back.

09:47.820 --> 09:49.173
But the box was gone.

09:49.220 --> 09:50.847
They only wanted the box.

09:50.890 --> 09:53.051
Are we buying all this?

09:53.090 --> 09:54.785
The captain is a smuggler,

09:54.820 --> 09:56.253
not a murderer?

09:56.290 --> 09:57.985
We are.

09:58.030 --> 10:00.248
So Rey Torres and those three
gang members were killed

10:00.300 --> 10:01.995
over some metal box?

10:02.030 --> 10:03.668
HOLMES:
Over the contents of the box.

10:03.700 --> 10:04.997
Unfortunately,
we've got no indication

10:05.030 --> 10:06.395
of what they might be.

10:06.430 --> 10:07.931
GREGSON:
Too bad you couldn't

10:07.970 --> 10:09.835
convince your client

10:09.870 --> 10:11.735
to not _burn down
the crime scene.

10:11.770 --> 10:13.271
That's a problem
with private clients.

10:13.310 --> 10:14.971
They frequently have
their own agendas,

10:15.010 --> 10:17.103
which is why I prefer
working with the police.

10:17.150 --> 10:19.812
Ah.
What?

10:19.850 --> 10:21.272
This is Captain Pack's phone,

10:21.320 --> 10:24.209
so he had his men follow
Rey Torres for almost a week.

10:24.250 --> 10:26.980
They sent photographs of the
various buildings that he uses

10:27.020 --> 10:29.215
a variety of offices, warehouses

10:29.260 --> 10:31.751
and this.

10:31.790 --> 10:33.894
A house.
According to
their texts

10:33.930 --> 10:36.296
it's in Woodbury, Long Island.

10:36.330 --> 10:38.696
He visited _
on three separate occa5ions,

10:38.730 --> 10:40.163
stayed only
a few hours each time.

10:40.200 --> 10:42.088
That makes me_ think
it's a casa chica,

10:42.140 --> 10:43.903
a home for his mistress.

10:43.940 --> 10:46.306
Torres wasn't married,
so why all the secrecy?

10:46.340 --> 10:48.171
For you, the answer
will have to wait, 'cause you

10:48.210 --> 10:49.848
have an appointment to keep.

10:49.880 --> 10:51.245
For you and I...

10:51.280 --> 10:53.669
Woodbury, here we come.

11:04.830 --> 11:07.196
That's that.

11:07.230 --> 11:09.323
You got your own place.

11:09.360 --> 11:12.329
You do this sort of thing
for all your old patients?

11:12.370 --> 11:15.259
Depends on how seriously
they're taking their parole.

11:15.300 --> 11:17.359
Mm-hmm. You know
a lot of ex-cons?

11:18.740 --> 11:20.298
You'd be surprised.

11:22.240 --> 11:25.004
Can I ask you
for one more favor?

11:27.880 --> 11:30.280
I have a daughter.
Chivonne.

11:30.320 --> 11:33.084
She was five when I got
put away. Her mother, Ceecee,

11:33.120 --> 11:35.759
didn't put me
on the birth certificate, but...

11:35.790 --> 11:37.451
she mine.

11:39.130 --> 11:40.757
When I was in Great Meadow,

11:40.800 --> 11:43.496
I wrote letters, birthday cards,
that sort of thing.

11:43.530 --> 11:46.829
And then, about four years ago,
Ceecee died.

11:46.870 --> 11:49.031
Overdose.

11:51.270 --> 11:53.875
I didn't even _know
she was usmg.

11:53.910 --> 11:56.231
And then_
my letters to Chivonne

11:56.280 --> 11:58.168
started coming back
unopened.

11:58.210 --> 12:00.371
So, when I got out,
I tried to track her down.

12:00.420 --> 12:03.981
Now, word is she went
to go live with relatives.

12:04.020 --> 12:06.750
But her people are out of
Trinidad by way of Florida,

12:06.790 --> 12:09.213
so she could be anywhere.

12:09.260 --> 12:11.820
You want my help finding her.

12:11.860 --> 12:14.328
You're a detective.

12:14.360 --> 12:16.351
I thought, maybe...

12:18.470 --> 12:20.461
maybe you...

12:20.500 --> 12:23.105
could think of something
that I didn't.

12:24.440 --> 12:26.431
(doorbell rings)

12:38.820 --> 12:40.913
Can I help you?

12:40.960 --> 12:43.485
It depends.
Are you Yun Jingyi?

12:45.490 --> 12:47.822
No one_ calls me
by my Chinese name.

12:47.860 --> 12:49.418
Not even my mother.

12:49.460 --> 12:52.520
Dr. Joan Watson, then.
Might we have a word?

12:54.040 --> 12:54.995
In private.

12:55.040 --> 12:56.393
Is this a problem?

12:56.440 --> 12:59.409
Uh, just give me
a few minutes, okay?

12:59.440 --> 13:01.431
I'll be back there.

13:06.950 --> 13:09.168
(door closes)

13:09.220 --> 13:11.085
What can I do for you?
My associates

13:11.120 --> 13:13.213
and I would like
to make you an offer.

13:13.260 --> 13:15.216
It's come to our attention
that your assoaate,

13:15.260 --> 13:18.457
Mr. Holmes, is looking
for a certain... object.

13:18.490 --> 13:20.299
An object which
may be at the center

13:20.330 --> 13:22.594
of some sordid
gangland killings.

13:22.630 --> 13:26.418
Was this object in a metal box?

13:26.470 --> 13:29.098
If you could for arrange for it
to fall into our hands,

13:29.140 --> 13:32.109
we would happily
pay you a finder's fee.

13:32.140 --> 13:34.506
Great. But maybe first
you could tell me

13:34.540 --> 13:36.906
what this object is
and why you want it.

13:36.950 --> 13:38.042
No.

13:38.080 --> 13:39.047
No?

13:39.080 --> 13:40.445
No.

13:40.480 --> 13:42.311
But here is a number

13:42.350 --> 13:44.443
where we can be reached.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.515
As well as the fee
we intend to pay

13:46.550 --> 13:49.929
once the object
has been recovered.

13:49.960 --> 13:51.951
We look forward
to hearing from you.

14:05.370 --> 14:07.509
$50 million.

14:11.210 --> 14:13.246
(doorbell rings)
Let me do the talking, okay?

14:13.280 --> 14:15.077
Why?

14:15.120 --> 14:16.917
If you're right about
this place, we're about to

14:16.950 --> 14:18.941
tell Rey Torres'
chica he's dead.

14:21.460 --> 14:23.223
Can I help you?

14:25.130 --> 14:28.054
This wasn't supposed to happen.

14:28.100 --> 14:29.897
You being lovers--
do you think that's why

14:29.930 --> 14:31.488
he was so_ secretive
about this place?

14:31.530 --> 14:33.498
Did he not_ want
his assoqates

14:33.540 --> 14:35.235
a_t Mara Tres_ to know
his sexual orientation?

14:35.270 --> 14:37.636
Did they find out?

14:37.670 --> 14:39.365
Is that
why he's dead?

14:39.410 --> 14:41.378
Did those
homophobic psychos kill Rey?

14:41.410 --> 14:43.605
We don't think that's
what this is about.

14:43.650 --> 14:46.244
Do you know anything
about a metal box?

14:46.280 --> 14:48.145
Something Rey might have
gotten his hands on

14:48.180 --> 14:49.477
in the past week or so?

14:49.520 --> 14:52.409
He said the thing inside
was worth a fortune.

14:52.450 --> 14:54.509
He was gonna auction it off,
make enough money

14:54.560 --> 14:56.255
to move away from New York
and Mara Tres forever.

14:56.290 --> 14:57.552
You know what was inside?

14:57.590 --> 15:00.150
He used to put it
on his desk over there.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.553
He'd take pictures of it

15:01.600 --> 15:04.296
for his bidders.

15:04.330 --> 15:06.525
It was, like, this...

15:06.570 --> 15:08.162
green rock.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.407
It was carved,
and with snakes on top.

15:10.440 --> 15:12.101
It was heavy.

15:12.140 --> 15:14.233
This green rock-- was it, um...

15:14.280 --> 15:16.168
Did it have a square base,

15:16.210 --> 15:19.145
about four or five inches,
each side?

15:19.180 --> 15:20.477
Sounds about right, yeah.

15:22.480 --> 15:23.947
How do you know?

15:37.230 --> 15:38.458
What are you doing?

15:38.500 --> 15:39.728
I'm, uh, I'm just...

15:39.770 --> 15:41.192
I'm-I'm dusting for prints,

15:41.240 --> 15:43.231
after a fashion.

15:49.440 --> 15:50.998
What are those?

15:51.050 --> 15:53.211
Uh, Chinese characters.

15:53.250 --> 15:55.616
They say,
"Receive the Mandate of Heaven,

15:55.650 --> 15:59.211
and with it longevity
and prosperity."

15:59.250 --> 16:01.559
So, assuming he had his hands
on the genuine article,

16:01.590 --> 16:03.353
Rey was right:

16:03.390 --> 16:05.688
the green rock
was worth a fortune.

16:05.730 --> 16:07.755
In fact, the Chinese emperor

16:07.800 --> 16:10.394
once traded it for 15 cities.

16:10.430 --> 16:12.227
Hence the Chinese
idiom for priceless,

16:12.270 --> 16:14.090
"worth several cities."

16:14.140 --> 16:15.630
It's possible that Rey

16:15.670 --> 16:18.138
stole the single most valuable

16:18.170 --> 16:20.536
missing object in human history,

16:20.580 --> 16:21.569
the Imperial Jade Seal of China.

16:29.820 --> 16:31.640
HOLMES:
All things considered,
$50 million for

16:31.690 --> 16:33.783
the Imperial Jade Seal
seems a bit low.

16:33.820 --> 16:35.708
Assuming it's the real Jade Seal

16:35.760 --> 16:38.285
that was in Torres' box,
I agree.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.696
But no one's even seen the thing
in over 1,000 years.

16:40.730 --> 16:43.096
Someone thinks it's real or they
wouldn't have offered you an

16:43.130 --> 16:45.621
eight-figure sum for it today.
Didn't identify themselves?

16:45.670 --> 16:47.467
No, but judging
by their accents,

16:47.500 --> 16:49.297
they were from Taiwan.
Mm.

16:49.340 --> 16:51.558
A nation which still calls
itself the Republic of China,

16:51.610 --> 16:55.171
_ _ still claims to be the _
legitimate government of China.

16:55.210 --> 16:56.768
According to legend,

16:56.810 --> 16:59.244
the Jade Seal
grants whoever owns it

16:59.280 --> 17:01.339
the "Mandate of Heaven"--

17:01.380 --> 17:02.779
divine right to rule China.

17:02.820 --> 17:05.345
So, if Taiwan gets the Seal

17:05.390 --> 17:08.052
_ it could mean
a major propaganda coup.

17:08.090 --> 17:09.648
Should we take them up
on their offer?

17:11.390 --> 17:13.051
_ Mara Tres
obVIously doesn't know

17:14.430 --> 17:15.749
or they would have
hired us to return it,

17:15.800 --> 17:17.495
not identify his killer.

17:17.530 --> 17:19.122
So, finders, keepers?

17:20.500 --> 17:22.229
We can give the money
to charity if you like.

17:22.270 --> 17:25.205
That would be great, but...

17:25.240 --> 17:27.777
by giving Taiwan the Seal
it could increase tensions

17:27.810 --> 17:29.471
between them and mainland China.

17:29.510 --> 17:32.775
I would rather not start
a second Chinese civil war.

17:34.480 --> 17:36.345
How did the Taiwanese
even know about the Seal?

17:36.380 --> 17:38.109
You hadn't even
told me about it yet.

17:38.150 --> 17:40.710
I'd surmise they were amongst
Rey's potential buyers

17:40.760 --> 17:43.422
and kept track of the
investigation into his death.

17:43.460 --> 17:45.826
Trying to bribe you
likely clears them of that,

17:45.860 --> 17:47.851
since whoever killed him

17:47.900 --> 17:50.095
already has the Seal.

17:50.130 --> 17:51.859
Probably one of
the other bidders, right?

17:51.900 --> 17:54.494
I mean, they're the only ones
that knew that Torres had it.

17:56.670 --> 17:59.662
According to his lover,
he met with

17:59.710 --> 18:01.439
potential bidders
face-to-face

18:01.480 --> 18:04.142
at one of the many properties
that he leases.

18:04.180 --> 18:05.875
If we can find out which one...

18:05.910 --> 18:08.811
we might be able to find
witnesses to the meeting.

18:13.520 --> 18:16.648
Hello, yes, I'd like to make a
very, very large catering order,

18:16.690 --> 18:18.885
so can I speak
to the owner, please?

18:18.930 --> 18:20.795
Yes, yes, of course I'll hold.

18:20.830 --> 18:22.388
Catering order?

18:23.730 --> 18:25.721
Rey's recent
credit card transactions.

18:29.840 --> 18:31.432
BVP Catering.

18:31.470 --> 18:33.301
There's five orders
here in the last week.

18:33.340 --> 18:34.671
I think those were fancy snacks

18:34.710 --> 18:37.508
for his bidders.

18:37.550 --> 18:39.700
Gonna try and persuade the owner
to give me the delivery address.

18:39.750 --> 18:41.274
Persuade, how?

18:41.320 --> 18:42.469
Well, everyone has a price.
We've just established

18:42.520 --> 18:43.885
that yours is north
of $50 million.

18:43.920 --> 18:47.856
Hopefully, BVP Catering
will be less.

18:51.730 --> 18:53.823
Rey knew what he was doing.

18:53.860 --> 18:55.828
Vacant building
in an industrial neighborhood--

18:55.860 --> 18:58.169
no neighbors, no tenants.

18:58.200 --> 19:00.634
And a private garage entrance
on a side street

19:00.670 --> 19:03.309
_where no one could see
his bidders coming or g0ing.

19:03.340 --> 19:06.366
Let's check out the sight lines
from over there.

19:16.520 --> 19:18.715
(phone ringing)

19:22.660 --> 19:24.548
It's Halcon from Mara Tres.

19:24.590 --> 19:26.558
Looking for an
update, probably.

19:26.590 --> 19:28.319
Shouldn't you get that?

19:28.360 --> 19:29.759
And tell him what?
That he inadvertently

19:29.800 --> 19:31.495
put us on the trail of an item

19:31.530 --> 19:33.862
that is literally
priceless?
(ringing stops)

19:33.900 --> 19:36.494
That won't complicate things
for us, will it?

19:44.450 --> 19:45.974
See something?

19:46.010 --> 19:47.511
This metal rail's
been bent

19:47.550 --> 19:49.677
in two places, here,
64 inches apart.

19:49.720 --> 19:52.245
As if someone recently
drove over it

19:52.290 --> 19:54.713
with a very heavy vehicle.

19:56.790 --> 19:58.587
_ Even if the metal
isn't up to standard,

19:58.630 --> 19:59.824
wouldn't that take a tank?

19:59.860 --> 20:01.555
Yeah, it would.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.568
Clearance is under seven feet--
there's no way you could

20:03.600 --> 20:05.227
get something
that big down here.

20:05.270 --> 20:06.965
No.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.935
But not all tanks
look like tanks.

20:11.970 --> 20:13.779
HOLMES:
It's a custom-built
armored car.

20:13.810 --> 20:15.698
13,000 pounds, total weight.

20:15.740 --> 20:18.504
Solid run-flat tires,
ballistic glass windows,

20:18.550 --> 20:19.903
A10 rated armor.

20:19.950 --> 20:22.771
Total cost: $1.4 million.

20:25.050 --> 20:27.018
armored personnel carrier
money can buy.

20:27.050 --> 20:29.450
And the preferred conveyance
of Wayne Vachs,

20:29.490 --> 20:31.879
CEO of Vachs Geological.

20:31.930 --> 20:34.455
Right-wing politics, coal mines,
fracking, that Wayne Vachs?

20:34.500 --> 20:36.422
I looked into him a couple
of years ago when our friends

20:36.460 --> 20:38.690
at Everyone were on the brink
of civil war.

20:38.730 --> 20:41.836
Amongst the details I uncovered
were this car and

20:41.870 --> 20:43.963
a lifelong passion
for Asian art.

20:44.010 --> 20:45.932
Seems like someone
who would bid on the Seal.

20:45.970 --> 20:47.039
So are we going in?

20:48.580 --> 20:49.877
I e-mailed his secretary
and I asked for an appointment.

20:49.910 --> 20:51.571
She said he was
out of the country.

20:51.610 --> 20:54.818
Obviously that's not true,
so we ambush him.

20:54.850 --> 20:56.374
Yeah, we ambush him.

20:56.420 --> 20:59.309
So, who's uh,
L'nelle Bickerstaff?

20:59.350 --> 21:02.478
I saw you typing that name
into your phone in the car.

21:02.520 --> 21:05.455
Yesterday Shinwell told me
he has a daughter, Chivonne.

21:05.490 --> 21:07.299
They lost touch
when he was in prison.

21:07.330 --> 21:08.729
He wants help
finding her.

21:08.760 --> 21:10.296
I'm pretty sure she's
staying with her aunt,

21:10.330 --> 21:12.298
L'nelle Bickerstaff,
but I have not been able

21:12.330 --> 21:14.469
to locate anyone by
that name in the US

21:15.640 --> 21:18.029
Think that's a wise thing to do?

21:19.510 --> 21:21.603
Efforts to help him
reenter society

21:21.640 --> 21:23.449
are, you know, admirable,

21:23.480 --> 21:26.699
but... you're just getting
to know him.

21:26.750 --> 21:28.718
And all the sentiment aside,

21:28.750 --> 21:30.615
you might be a happier,
healthier person

21:30.650 --> 21:32.413
because you didn't interact
with your biological father

21:32.450 --> 21:33.610
when you were a child.

21:33.660 --> 21:34.809
The same might be true
for Chivonne

21:34.860 --> 21:36.657
and her father.

21:38.760 --> 21:40.489
Ambush time.

21:42.600 --> 21:44.568
Mr. Vachs,

21:44.600 --> 21:46.465
we're, uh, consultants
with the NYPD. Like to ask you

21:46.500 --> 21:48.036
a few questions.
Mr. Vachs knows who you are

21:48.070 --> 21:49.560
and who you work for.

21:49.600 --> 21:51.500
_ He's not interested
in speaking With you.

21:51.540 --> 21:54.031
Maybe he'd like us to come
back with our colleagues
from Major Crimes.

21:54.080 --> 21:56.036
If you approach Mr. Vachs again,
he'll have you arrested.

21:56.080 --> 21:58.708
Is that clear?
That would be a neat trick,
having us arrested.

21:58.750 --> 22:00.547
Actually, it wouldn't
be difficult at all.

22:02.880 --> 22:04.586
This is a restraining order.

22:04.620 --> 22:05.917
You're not to come
within 50 yards

22:05.950 --> 22:07.554
of Mr. Vachs _
or any of his properties,

22:07.590 --> 22:09.785
effective immediately.

22:09.820 --> 22:12.857
Conﬁder
yourselves served.

22:12.890 --> 22:16.018
(engines start)

22:19.500 --> 22:21.388
Did you notice that these things
were applied for

22:21.440 --> 22:22.668
almost two years ago?

22:22.700 --> 22:24.531
About the same time
we were looking into

22:24.570 --> 22:28.939
Vachs' so-called think tank,
the Atherton Foundation.

22:28.980 --> 22:30.402
So, what, he had these drawn up

22:30.450 --> 22:31.678
and then
when he didn't need them,

22:31.710 --> 22:33.678
he saved them, just in case?

22:33.720 --> 22:35.676
Have to admire
the foresight.

22:35.720 --> 22:37.847
Must have had them dug up
when I contacted his office

22:37.890 --> 22:40.450
this morning. Suggests we're
on the right track, no?

22:40.490 --> 22:42.549
Have you found anything?
Mostly,

22:42.590 --> 22:45.423
I just reconfirmed
my previous research.

22:45.460 --> 22:48.554
Still, he's a man
with a long history of
questionable business deals.

22:48.600 --> 22:51.125
I'm certain we can find _
something to leverage a meeting.

22:51.170 --> 22:53.991
We should get Everyone to help.
They hate Vachs.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.689
They'd probably dig into him
for free.

22:55.740 --> 22:57.560
That would be a
good change of pace.

22:57.610 --> 23:00.431
And I thinkI know which rock
they should look under first.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.732
(doorbell rings)

23:04.850 --> 23:06.442
Hi.

23:06.480 --> 23:07.447
I'm Kuo Wenling.

23:07.480 --> 23:09.175
But you can call me Wendy.

23:09.220 --> 23:10.983
I have a message
from my father.

23:11.020 --> 23:12.510
And your father is...?

23:12.550 --> 23:14.689
Kuo Lanqing. He's...

23:14.720 --> 23:16.881
Minister of Commerce for
the People's Republic of China.

23:16.920 --> 23:18.888
You're a long way from home.

23:18.930 --> 23:21.057
I took the subway.

23:21.100 --> 23:23.989
I'm a grad student at Columbia.

23:24.030 --> 23:27.830
Dad says to tell you that
the gross domestic product

23:27.870 --> 23:31.829
of Taiwan is
530 billion USD.

23:31.870 --> 23:34.930
But the GDP of
the People's Republic of China

23:34.980 --> 23:37.039
is over $10
trillion.

23:37.080 --> 23:38.445
20 times as big.

23:38.480 --> 23:40.812
So... we have more money.

23:40.850 --> 23:43.068
In other words,
China's aware of the overtures

23:43.120 --> 23:44.940
we_ received
from Taiwan yesterday

23:44.990 --> 23:47.208
and whatever they're offering,
the People's Republic
can beat it.

23:47.250 --> 23:48.888
I don't know.

23:48.920 --> 23:50.524
I guess?

23:50.560 --> 23:52.858
I have to go now.

23:52.890 --> 23:56.656
I have papers to grade. Bye-bye.

23:59.570 --> 24:01.538
Another country
heard from.

24:01.570 --> 24:04.869
On the bright side, China
is probably the rightful owner

24:04.910 --> 24:08.038
of the Seal and 20 times
$50 million is $1 billion.

24:08.080 --> 24:09.775
So we've established your price.

24:09.810 --> 24:12.005
(phone ringing)

24:12.050 --> 24:14.018
Halcon again.

24:14.050 --> 24:15.915
You know what
you should do?

24:15.950 --> 24:18.043
Keep screening the scary drug
lord, because there's no chance

24:18.090 --> 24:21.059
that he's gonna show up
on our doorstep next.

24:21.090 --> 24:22.978
Hello?

24:29.100 --> 24:31.898
Now, that's a good spot
for an execution.

24:31.930 --> 24:34.637
But you came anyway.

24:34.670 --> 24:37.537
I'm making too much progress
for you to kill me.

24:37.570 --> 24:40.630
I've identified a likely
motive for Rey's murder,

24:40.680 --> 24:42.534
and I might even have a suspect.

24:42.580 --> 24:45.071
VVho?
Notyet

24:45.110 --> 24:47.249
Given the stakes, I-I need
to be certain that I'm right.

24:47.280 --> 24:50.545
I'm sure you
understand.

24:50.590 --> 24:52.911
So, if that'll suffice
for an update...

24:52.950 --> 24:55.555
I didn't call you out here
to get an update.

24:55.590 --> 24:58.582
I called you out here
to give you an update.

24:59.590 --> 25:01.854
Come on.

25:17.140 --> 25:19.847
Who's that?

25:19.880 --> 25:22.644
Chele named Jimmy Koslow.

25:22.680 --> 25:25.547
He's the one who's been slinging
your bad heroin.

25:25.590 --> 25:28.081
I asked you to identify him,
not murder him.

25:28.120 --> 25:29.815
You know
how we do.

25:31.030 --> 25:33.225
I held up my end of the bargain.

25:33.260 --> 25:35.251
You hold up yours.

25:35.300 --> 25:37.188
Or risk dismemberment?

25:37.230 --> 25:40.199
Him... I didn't care about.

25:40.230 --> 25:43.905
He didn't disrespect me.
He wasn't personal.

25:43.940 --> 25:46.602
Don't find out what happens
when it's personal.

25:46.640 --> 25:47.629
You got two days.

25:59.850 --> 26:02.250
According to Marcus' search
of the late Mr. Koslow's home,

26:02.290 --> 26:04.656
it yielded fentanyl-cut
heroin identical to the batch

26:04.690 --> 26:06.885
that killed the woman
from my meeting.

26:08.100 --> 26:09.920
So, at least there
shouldn't be any more deaths.

26:09.960 --> 26:12.121
Attributable to the heroin?
That's very hard to say.

26:12.170 --> 26:15.139
Attributable to Mara Tres?
Also hard to say.

26:15.170 --> 26:17.263
As is their custom,
they made no attempt

26:17.300 --> 26:19.359
to obfuscate their involvement
in Koslow's death.

26:19.410 --> 26:21.799
The gang member responsible
left behind a murder weapon

26:21.840 --> 26:23.808
with ample fingerprints on it,
so he's, no doubt,

26:23.850 --> 26:25.272
already been sent back
to Central America,

26:25.310 --> 26:27.870
where he's out of our reach.

26:27.920 --> 26:30.070
Well, we can still connect
the murder to Halcon.

26:30.120 --> 26:32.338
We could do, if the crime
hadn't already been claimed

26:32.390 --> 26:35.211
by the Department's
Organized Crime Task Force.

26:35.260 --> 26:38.149
They've been, uh, building
a case against him for years.

26:38.190 --> 26:41.023
Any chance they'll arrest him
before you end up in a Dumpster?

26:41.060 --> 26:42.755
Now is probably a good time
to mention that you were

26:42.800 --> 26:44.028
_ _also_ included
in his original threats.

26:44.070 --> 26:45.765
What?

26:45.800 --> 26:47.893
We are, as always,
a package deal.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.896
But never fear.

26:49.940 --> 26:51.760
Our heads and limbs
shall remain attached

26:51.810 --> 26:53.163
to our respective torsos.

26:53.210 --> 26:55.371
Unless, of course,
you ignored my instruction

26:55.410 --> 26:58.174
to contact Everyone and ask them
to look under a certain rock.

26:58.210 --> 27:00.770
They e-mailed
a little while ago.

27:00.820 --> 27:03.209
Everything you asked for
is right there.

27:07.220 --> 27:09.211
Oh, yeah,
this'll do nicely.

27:11.090 --> 27:13.388
(over bullhorn):
Matt Driscoll,
murdered by Wayne Vachs.

27:13.430 --> 27:16.194
Jason Green,
murdered by Wayne Vachs.

27:16.230 --> 27:19.199
Trevor Harris,
murdered by Wayne Vachs.

27:19.230 --> 27:21.369
John Killan Jr.,

27:21.400 --> 27:23.061
murdered by
Wayne Vachs.

27:23.100 --> 27:25.000
Craig Hawthorne,

27:25.040 --> 27:27.838
murdered by Wayne...
Stop it
or I'm calling the police.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.677
You'll note the chalk line
on the sidewalk.

27:29.710 --> 27:31.974
It's exactly 50 yards
from Vachs Geological.

27:32.010 --> 27:34.114
So unless I cross it,
I'm not in violation

27:34.150 --> 27:36.710
of your restraining order.

27:36.750 --> 27:38.411
Edward Nance, murdered...

27:38.450 --> 27:40.338
It doesn't matter
where you stand.

27:40.390 --> 27:43.086
You can't slander Mr. Vachs
with false accusations.

27:43.120 --> 27:45.350
Oh, but they're not false.
These are men that your employer

27:45.390 --> 27:48.723
admits to killing, 22 miners
who died in a mine collapse

27:48.760 --> 27:50.421
in Kentucky in 2009.

27:50.460 --> 27:52.098
That case was settled.
Yes.

27:52.130 --> 27:54.269
Mr. Vachs pled guilty
to misdemeanor safety violations

27:54.300 --> 27:55.858
and he got probation.

27:55.900 --> 27:57.834
But the deaths
are still legally his fault.

27:57.870 --> 27:59.269
The deaths are old news.

27:59.310 --> 28:01.403
Tragic but old news.

28:01.440 --> 28:03.408
I'm about to_ name
his co-conspirators,

28:03.440 --> 28:05.476
his unindicted co-conspirators,

28:05.510 --> 28:07.341
people who turned a blind eye
to the safety violations

28:07.380 --> 28:10.110
and who helped him get away
with a slap on the wrist.

28:10.150 --> 28:11.981
Including several
prominent politicians.

28:12.020 --> 28:14.056
I got their names from a hacker
collective called Everyone.

28:14.090 --> 28:15.318
Perhaps you've heard of them.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.316
You're bluffing.

28:24.170 --> 28:25.364
I could be persuaded
to hold my tongue

28:25.400 --> 28:27.937
if Mr. Vachs agrees
to a meeting.

28:29.040 --> 28:31.804
Mr. Holmes.

28:31.840 --> 28:34.001
Please come in.

28:34.040 --> 28:36.031
Welcome. Make
yourself at home.

28:38.350 --> 28:40.773
So, where's the tall one
who accosted me yesterday?

28:40.820 --> 28:43.141
I wanted anothhelrr word with him.
0,

28:43.180 --> 28:45.944
we don't need him. Unless
you're planning to kill me.

28:45.990 --> 28:47.810
No, not at the moment.

28:47.860 --> 28:51.159
That was some ultimatum you
gave Ms. Lawler out there.

28:51.190 --> 28:53.351
That's not why
I agreed to see you.

28:53.390 --> 28:56.518
This list of yours
that you're releasing,

28:56.560 --> 29:00.189
it could damage the careers of
some very fine public servants,

29:00.230 --> 29:02.198
but it won't
hurt me one iota.

29:02.240 --> 29:03.969
Well, I find that
very hard to believe.

29:04.010 --> 29:05.898
You've spent a lot of time
and money cultivating

29:05.940 --> 29:08.170
your political pets.
I haven't
funded my PACs

29:08.210 --> 29:11.077
in a year.
I got tired of politics.

29:11.110 --> 29:12.907
Well, if you no longer have
political interests,

29:12.950 --> 29:14.474
why did you agree
to an audience?

29:14.520 --> 29:17.819
I know what you're working on,
and I want to help you.

29:17.850 --> 29:19.215
You want
to help me find the murderer

29:19.250 --> 29:20.478
of a Salvadorian smuggler?

29:20.520 --> 29:23.080
Rey Torres?
No, I don't care about him.

29:23.120 --> 29:25.520
I want to help you find
the Imperial Jade Seal.

29:27.090 --> 29:29.149
I am the legal owner, after all.

29:29.200 --> 29:32.021
How can you be the legal owner
of a stolen, smuggled antiquity?

29:32.070 --> 29:34.197
Because I won Rey's auction.

29:34.240 --> 29:37.198
Papers show the verified bid.

29:37.240 --> 29:39.458
Letters of provenance.

29:39.510 --> 29:41.375
They show that the Seal
has been in the US.

29:41.410 --> 29:43.469
for over a century.

29:43.510 --> 29:47.071
Well before the 2009
Chinese Antiquities Act.

29:52.090 --> 29:55.355
(sniffs)
The Seal was smuggled
into the country just last week.

29:55.390 --> 29:57.858
Isn't that for the
courts to decide?

29:57.890 --> 30:00.120
You're certain
this is the real Seal.

30:00.160 --> 30:02.856
Well, I wouldn't have paid
that much if I wasn't.

30:02.900 --> 30:05.368
But the point is,
Rey accepted my bid.

30:05.400 --> 30:08.836
We were about to make the final
exchange and he was murdered.

30:08.870 --> 30:10.360
So if you want to find out
who killed him

30:10.400 --> 30:13.369
and who stole my property,
I suggest you start

30:13.410 --> 30:16.174
by trying to identify
the losing bidders.

30:18.180 --> 30:19.340
*

30:19.380 --> 30:21.211
How'd you find me?

30:21.250 --> 30:23.377
I haven't been
L'nelle Bickerstaff in years.

30:23.420 --> 30:25.945
Your name change to Laila Kalifa
is public record,

30:25.990 --> 30:28.208
and you did not change
Chivonne's first name.

30:28.260 --> 30:29.887
I didn't want
to put that on her.

30:29.920 --> 30:31.979
She'd been through
enough changes.

30:33.390 --> 30:34.857
How much is he paying you?

30:34.900 --> 30:37.027
Nothing, actually.
Shinwell's a friend.

30:38.330 --> 30:41.094
I'm doing him a favor.
Funny,

30:41.140 --> 30:43.096
you don't look
like his kind of friend.

30:43.140 --> 30:45.631
How well do you know him?

30:45.670 --> 30:48.377
How well do you know him?

30:48.410 --> 30:49.877
I know he's a criminal.

30:49.910 --> 30:51.548
He_ was
a criminal.

30:51.580 --> 30:54.879
And now he's just, what, cured?

30:54.920 --> 30:57.047
He's ready to be a father
to Chivonne?

30:57.080 --> 30:59.241
He lost touch with her.

30:59.290 --> 31:01.508
He wants to know she's okay.

31:01.560 --> 31:03.983
She's better than okay.

31:04.030 --> 31:06.021
She's amazing.

31:06.060 --> 31:08.358
When I think of everything
that that girl has managed

31:08.400 --> 31:09.549
to overcome,

31:09.600 --> 31:11.522
everything she has
in front of her,

31:11.570 --> 31:13.936
changing my name,
that wasn't just religion.

31:13.970 --> 31:15.995
I knew that this day would come.

31:16.040 --> 31:18.065
And I knew
that if I ever let Shinwell back

31:18.110 --> 31:20.066
into Chivonne's life,
I'd be letting in the drugs

31:20.110 --> 31:21.668
and the guns and the gangs

31:21.710 --> 31:24.406
right along
with him.
He's working on himself now.

31:24.450 --> 31:27.476
You sure
about that?

31:27.510 --> 31:29.478
You said you wanted
my permission

31:29.520 --> 31:32.341
to let Shinwell know
where Chivonne is.

31:32.390 --> 31:35.109
You can't have it.

31:35.160 --> 31:37.355
I understand why
you would be reluctant to...

31:37.390 --> 31:40.188
Look, I'm not reluctant.

31:40.230 --> 31:42.095
I'm afraid.

31:42.130 --> 31:45.224
Men like Shinwell only care
about one thing-- themselves.

31:45.270 --> 31:48.592
That's why they steal,
that's why they deal drugs,

31:48.640 --> 31:51.302
that's why they kill.

31:51.340 --> 31:55.071
Look, Shinwell only thinks
he's changed.

31:55.110 --> 31:58.477
I know better,
and you should, too.

32:00.250 --> 32:02.172
Chivonne's not the only one
he could end up hurting.

32:08.120 --> 32:09.678
c, right?

32:09.720 --> 32:12.086
We never actually met.
I'm Joan.

32:12.130 --> 32:14.018
Oh, please
don't tell me.

32:14.060 --> 32:16.096
The less I know
about S, the better.

32:16.130 --> 32:17.961
"S"?
HOLMES:
It's my nom de plume

32:18.000 --> 32:19.695
when corresponding with C.

32:19.730 --> 32:22.096
We put a premium
on our anonymity.

32:22.140 --> 32:24.506
Call me "J."

32:24.540 --> 32:27.304
C is an appraiser for
a major auction house.

32:27.340 --> 32:29.331
I asked her to review the, uh,
letters of provenance

32:29.380 --> 32:30.972
I received from Wayne Vachs.

32:31.010 --> 32:32.648
They are forgeries,
as you suspected.

32:32.680 --> 32:34.443
Likely created by

32:34.480 --> 32:37.369
whoever got the Seal
smuggled into the country.

32:37.420 --> 32:41.356
As far as I can tell,
Mr. Vachs did win the auction.

32:41.390 --> 32:43.381
So odds are

32:43.420 --> 32:45.456
he didn't kill Torres
to take the Seal.

32:45.490 --> 32:47.355
What do you make
of the opposition research

32:47.390 --> 32:49.324
regarding the other
potential buyers?

32:49.360 --> 32:52.466
You say that you've already
ruled out China and Taiwan?

32:52.500 --> 32:53.762
Some of the parties

32:53.800 --> 32:56.394
on this list certainly would buy

32:56.440 --> 32:58.408
an artifact
of dubious provenance,

32:58.440 --> 33:01.000
but I... I_ have a hard time
imagining

33:01.040 --> 33:03.201
any of them
commissioning assassins.

33:03.240 --> 33:04.673
That being said,

33:04.710 --> 33:07.406
there is a significant
gap here on this.

33:07.450 --> 33:09.543
This notation: Museums.

33:09.580 --> 33:12.219
Question mark. No detail.

33:12.250 --> 33:13.547
The Seal would be

33:13.590 --> 33:15.182
abbdmw
for the right museum.

33:15.220 --> 33:17.017
I was thinking of the
Densham Institute.

33:17.060 --> 33:18.357
Do you know it?

33:20.590 --> 33:23.559
The Densham Institute
was founded a hundred years ago

33:23.600 --> 33:25.568
by the Densham brothers.

33:25.600 --> 33:28.296
They made their fortune
in textiles.

33:28.340 --> 33:31.559
Last year, one of the heirs,
David Densham,

33:31.610 --> 33:34.170
was appointed
curator in chief.

33:34.210 --> 33:37.577
He wants to_ make the museum
a more fitting monument

33:37.610 --> 33:39.578
to his family name.

33:39.610 --> 33:42.716
He is looking
for signature works

33:42.750 --> 33:44.445
to enhance the collection.

33:44.490 --> 33:46.481
And you think that might include
the Jade Seal?

33:46.520 --> 33:48.181
Two months ago,

33:48.220 --> 33:51.724
I tried to contact David _
about a Tang landscape painting.

33:51.760 --> 33:54.490
His assistant told me
he was in A5ia

33:54.530 --> 33:56.395
with no access
to the Internet

33:56.430 --> 33:58.728
or phone service.
When he returned

33:58.770 --> 34:01.739
a few weeks later, he told me

34:01.770 --> 34:04.330
that he h_ad_been_
on an achISItion trip,

34:04.370 --> 34:05.598
but he wouldn't tell me where.

34:05.640 --> 34:07.267
So, not many places
in Asia

34:07.310 --> 34:08.834
where you can be
cut off completely

34:08.880 --> 34:11.405
from the outside world
and still go shopping

34:11.450 --> 34:13.771
for museum-worthy art.
C:
I can only think of one.

34:13.810 --> 34:15.675
North Korea.

34:16.820 --> 34:18.583
Well, the North Koreans

34:18.620 --> 34:20.212
smuggled the Seal
into the United States.

34:20.250 --> 34:21.649
If they were delivering it
to Densham,

34:21.690 --> 34:23.282
and it got stolen
by Rey Torres...

34:23.320 --> 34:24.821
Torres may have

34:24.860 --> 34:27.283
invited Densham to bid
on the Seal without realizing

34:27.330 --> 34:29.696
that Densham was the one he took
it from in the first place.

34:29.730 --> 34:31.664
David perhaps did not want

34:31.700 --> 34:35.261
_ to bid_ _
on a priceless artifact twice.

34:37.140 --> 34:40.166
So according to Marcus, David
Densham has a checkered past.

34:40.210 --> 34:42.474
Domestic violence,
drunken brawls.

34:42.510 --> 34:45.274
So he doesn't just have the
resources to be our killer.

34:45.310 --> 34:47.278
He has the
temperament.

34:47.310 --> 34:49.312
(garbled radio transmission)
WATSON:
Did you call Marcus to join us?

34:49.350 --> 34:51.318
I did not.

34:52.690 --> 34:54.510
Housekeeper found him
a couple hours ago.

34:54.560 --> 34:55.857
Blow to the head.

34:55.890 --> 34:57.585
We're looking into his ex.

34:57.620 --> 34:59.485
Well, unless
she's over six foot tall

34:59.530 --> 35:01.498
and incredibly strong,
I wouldn't bother.

35:01.530 --> 35:03.896
That being said, I think I can
identify the murder weapon.

35:03.930 --> 35:05.397
DETECTIVE:
So can I.

35:05.430 --> 35:07.261
CSU bagged it 20 minutes ago.

35:07.300 --> 35:08.836
The killer left it?

35:14.310 --> 35:17.905
This is what was used to cave
David Densham's skull in?

35:17.940 --> 35:21.569
WATSON:
The evidence receipt says it's a
"jade block, four inches square,

35:21.620 --> 35:24.180
topped by intertwined dragons."

35:24.220 --> 35:25.915
HOLMES:
But it is not,
as stated,

35:25.950 --> 35:27.383
a paperweight.

35:27.420 --> 35:29.581
It is, in all
likelihood,

35:29.620 --> 35:32.521
the one, the only,
the original

35:32.560 --> 35:33.549
Imperial Jade Seal of China.

35:47.840 --> 35:51.344
Tell me you got permission
to get ink on that thing.

35:51.380 --> 35:52.404
We're sending the prints

35:52.450 --> 35:53.906
to experts to compare
against historical documents

35:53.950 --> 35:55.542
stamped by the real Seal.

35:55.580 --> 35:57.343
They'll try to confirm that

35:57.380 --> 35:58.688
this is the original,
and not a forgery.

35:58.720 --> 36:00.347
Well, I thought
you should know I talked

36:00.390 --> 36:01.687
to the detectives working
the Densham case.

36:01.720 --> 36:03.256
They're moving off of his ex.

36:03.290 --> 36:04.780
Now they figure
Densham had Rey Torres killed

36:04.830 --> 36:06.388
to get that thing back,

36:06.430 --> 36:09.297
then Mara Tres killed Densham
out of revenge.

36:09.330 --> 36:11.662
All very neat and tidy,
and all completely wrong.

36:11.700 --> 36:13.497
Yeah, I don't buy it, either.

36:13.530 --> 36:15.669
For one thing,
Densham died fast.

36:15.700 --> 36:17.395
Mara Tres would have
made him suffer.

36:17.440 --> 36:19.260
Plus, the Seal was wiped clean.

36:19.310 --> 36:21.938
Mara Tres_ hit _men
leave their prints.

36:21.980 --> 36:23.834
Also, the angle
of the killing blow suggests

36:23.880 --> 36:27.202
that Densham was killed
by a tall, left-handed person,

36:27.250 --> 36:28.740
at least six foot, two.

36:28.780 --> 36:31.214
You said
that whoever killed Rey Torres

36:31.250 --> 36:32.842
was tall and left-handed,
as well.

36:32.890 --> 36:35.586
Same guy?
Stands to reason.

36:35.620 --> 36:37.713
But why would anyone kill Rey
to get the Seal

36:37.760 --> 36:39.853
and then leave it at the scene
of Densham's murder?

36:39.890 --> 36:42.222
What do you think will happen
to the Seal

36:42.260 --> 36:44.421
when the NYPD no longer has it
in evidence?

36:44.470 --> 36:46.290
Turn it over to the Feds,
I guess.

36:46.330 --> 36:48.469
And then where would it go?

36:49.640 --> 36:51.437
China, right?

36:51.470 --> 36:52.903
That's the law.

36:52.940 --> 36:54.908
Any Chinese artifact brought
into the U.S.

36:54.940 --> 36:56.703
after 2009
gets returned to China.

36:56.740 --> 36:58.708
We can safely assume
the Chinese didn't kill Densham.

36:58.750 --> 37:01.002
If they had, they would not have
left the Seal behind.

37:01.050 --> 37:03.644
They would have put it in a
diplomatic pouch, sent it home.

37:03.680 --> 37:05.648
So someone else wanted
the Chinese to get it,

37:05.690 --> 37:07.840
but not in a way
that could be traced back.

37:07.890 --> 37:11.451
Why?
There's a saying in
Chinese, "Wanbi guizhao."

37:11.490 --> 37:14.323
"Return the jade
intact to Zhao."

37:14.360 --> 37:16.726
It means to give something
back to its rightful owner.

37:16.760 --> 37:18.523
It's based on
a story where

37:18.570 --> 37:21.733
the Seal was stolen, and a hero
brings it home unharmed.

37:21.770 --> 37:23.465
As a reward, he's made

37:23.500 --> 37:26.003
prime minister.
HOLMES:
So who might expect

37:26.040 --> 37:28.838
a reward for returning
the Jade Seal to China?
GREGSON: Hey.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.438
There's someone here to see you.

37:33.880 --> 37:35.472
WATSON:
Tell me you don't think

37:35.520 --> 37:36.839
she's the one behind all this.

37:36.880 --> 37:38.848
To the best of my knowledge,
she doesn't have a tall,

37:38.890 --> 37:40.414
left-handed killer
in her employ,

37:40.450 --> 37:41.553
but I know
someone who does.

37:41.590 --> 37:42.887
I think if I threaten

37:42.920 --> 37:44.421
to delay the Seal's
return to China,

37:44.460 --> 37:47.349
_her father will
confirm my suspICIons.

37:47.390 --> 37:48.823
Wendy!

37:48.860 --> 37:51.328
Need you to send
a message for me.

37:51.370 --> 37:52.519
(door opens)

37:54.600 --> 37:56.636
Mr. Holmes,
nobody told me you were here.

37:56.670 --> 37:58.968
Yeah, probably because no one
saw me enter the premises.

37:59.010 --> 38:00.637
That new security team
you've got--

38:00.670 --> 38:03.002
not as sharp as
their predecessors.

38:04.680 --> 38:07.569
Why are you showing me pictures
of body parts?

38:07.610 --> 38:09.646
All in good time. First,

38:09.680 --> 38:12.581
I want you to know that
I know you're nearly bankrupt.

38:12.620 --> 38:14.656
It's the real reason you stopped
paying your political cronies.

38:14.690 --> 38:16.055
You can't afford them anymore.

38:16.090 --> 38:18.524
Why? Because in addition
to killing 22 men,

38:18.560 --> 38:21.393
your mine collapse triggered
a landslide, which polluted

38:21.430 --> 38:23.648
a large swath of
Kentuclq watershed.

38:23.700 --> 38:25.588
And you're legally responsible
for the clean-up.

38:25.630 --> 38:28.428
The EPA's about to bill you for
hundreds of millions of dollars.

38:29.840 --> 38:31.535
A vast deposit
of rare earth minerals

38:31.570 --> 38:33.606
was recently discovered
in Western China.

38:33.640 --> 38:36.336
Whoever secures that development
contract is gonna make billions.

38:36.380 --> 38:37.972
I have it on very good

38:38.010 --> 38:41.878
authority that thanks to your
help with the recent unspecified

38:41.920 --> 38:44.946
issue, the Chinese are gonna
award that contract to you.

38:44.990 --> 38:46.946
Well, that's a legitimate
business deal.

38:46.990 --> 38:48.412
The other day I asked you

38:48.460 --> 38:49.950
about your head of security.
Tall fellow.

38:49.990 --> 38:51.719
Left-handed. I could tell
by the placement

38:51.760 --> 38:52.829
of his holster.

38:52.860 --> 38:54.350
Led a team of six.

38:54.400 --> 38:55.822
Flight records indicate
that your private jet

38:55.860 --> 38:58.693
_ _left for Morocco
With SIX passengers on board

38:58.730 --> 39:01.437
just hours after David Densham's
bludgeoning.

39:01.470 --> 39:02.869
Nice place, Morocco.

39:02.900 --> 39:04.902
Low cost of living,
no U.S. extradition treaty.

39:04.940 --> 39:07.465
So what are you suggesting--
that I had Rey Torres killed

39:07.510 --> 39:08.932
so I could get the Seal

39:08.980 --> 39:11.699
and trade it with the Chinese
for the mineral deal?

39:11.750 --> 39:13.672
I already told you
that I won the auction.

39:13.710 --> 39:16.747
Ah. Except you couldn't pay
for your winning bid, could you?

39:16.780 --> 39:20.739
So instead, you had your men
kill Rey Torres and take it.

39:21.960 --> 39:23.757
Say you're right.

39:23.790 --> 39:25.553
Why didn't I get
the Seal and just

39:25.590 --> 39:27.785
give it to the Chinese
and be done with it?

39:27.830 --> 39:30.492
Because before you could
agree terms with them,

39:30.530 --> 39:32.088
I began to suspect you.

39:32.130 --> 39:34.394
If the police found the Seal
in your possession,

39:34.440 --> 39:37.432
all would be lost, so you had
your men kill David Densham

39:37.470 --> 39:38.801
and leave it
with him.

39:38.840 --> 39:40.432
The physical return

39:40.470 --> 39:41.971
of the Seal is no longer
your problem,

39:42.010 --> 39:44.649
'cause the U.S. government
is going to do it for you.

39:44.680 --> 39:46.841
But the Chinese--
they'll still know who to thank.

39:46.880 --> 39:49.542
I suppose you can prove
all of this?

39:49.580 --> 39:51.548
I can prove none of it.

39:51.590 --> 39:54.809
Those limbs once added up
to a man named Jimmy Koslow.

39:54.860 --> 39:57.784
He ran afoul of a street gang--
Mara Tres.

39:57.820 --> 39:59.549
They're clients
of mine.

39:59.590 --> 40:01.899
They're not concerned
with courts of law.

40:01.930 --> 40:03.625
They much prefer revenge.

40:03.660 --> 40:05.093
Brutal revenge.

40:06.700 --> 40:08.588
Rey Torres was
their favorite smuggler,

40:08.640 --> 40:11.200
and now he's dead,
thanks to you.

40:15.510 --> 40:17.478
and you're going to be the
next one going to pieces.

40:17.510 --> 40:18.875
You wouldn't.

40:18.910 --> 40:20.673
Confess.

40:20.710 --> 40:24.077
If you're arrested,
tried and convicted,

40:24.120 --> 40:27.612
I might be able to persuade them
that justice has been done.

40:27.650 --> 40:29.811
If Jimmy Koslow was offered
the same opportunity,

40:29.860 --> 40:32.021
I think he'd have taken it.

40:32.060 --> 40:33.948
Don't you?

40:35.800 --> 40:37.097
MAN:
It's good, though.
That's it.

40:37.130 --> 40:38.825
Quick feet. Quick feet.
WATSON:
Hey.

40:38.870 --> 40:40.167
I got your text.

40:40.200 --> 40:42.065
Thanks for coming.

40:42.100 --> 40:43.897
Look, if you're hoping
for an update on Chivonne...

40:43.940 --> 40:45.237
I don't need an update.

40:45.270 --> 40:47.101
Found her on my own.

40:47.140 --> 40:49.608
She's a goalie.

40:49.640 --> 40:50.937
(indistinct shouting)

40:50.980 --> 40:52.777
MAN:
Yeah. Yeah, right there.

40:52.810 --> 40:55.870
She's good.
From what I hear, she
good at a lot of things.

40:55.920 --> 40:58.639
Sports, school.

41:00.650 --> 41:02.652
How'd you find her?

41:02.690 --> 41:04.726
You wasn't the first person
I asked for help.

41:04.760 --> 41:06.682
As soon as I got out
of Great Meadow, I

41:06.730 --> 41:07.924
put out feelers,

41:07.960 --> 41:09.655
and one finally panned out.

41:09.700 --> 41:11.190
MAN:
Okay, you're up.

41:11.230 --> 41:12.766
MAN:
There you go.

41:13.970 --> 41:15.733
Look, before you talk
to her, I think...

41:15.770 --> 41:19.934
I'm not... going
to talk to her.

41:19.970 --> 41:23.235
I want to. I want to
like you wouldn't believe.

41:23.280 --> 41:24.907
It's not the time.

41:26.750 --> 41:29.776
I want her in my life,
I have to earn it.

41:30.880 --> 41:32.711
* I'm dark inside...

41:32.750 --> 41:35.651
(door closes, device beeping)
WATSON:
Looking for bugs?

41:36.890 --> 41:39.085
Stud, actually.

41:39.130 --> 41:41.257
You'll be happy to hear
that Vachs confessed

41:41.290 --> 41:45.829
to ordering the murders
of David Densham, Rey Torres

41:45.870 --> 41:49.260
and the three
Mara Tres pistoleros.

41:49.300 --> 41:50.858
I am happy.

41:50.900 --> 41:52.561
(drill whirring)
Was Halcon happy?

41:52.610 --> 41:55.101
Not at first,
but eventually he agreed

41:55.140 --> 41:57.608
to keep his distance from us.

41:57.640 --> 42:00.746
So our lives
can return to normal.

42:00.780 --> 42:03.613
Wanbi guizhao, as they say.

42:03.650 --> 42:07.279
Everything back
in its rightful place,

42:07.320 --> 42:09.880
all in one piece.

42:09.920 --> 42:11.581
* I'm floating again

42:11.630 --> 42:14.849
* Weightless

42:14.900 --> 42:15.889
* Beneath your paper moon...
