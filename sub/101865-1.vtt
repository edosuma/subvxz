WEBVTT

02:01.867 --> 02:03.267
Backup's 10 out.

02:04.834 --> 02:06.368
I've been hunting these
psychos for three years

02:06.401 --> 02:08.001
and 16 bodies.

02:08.900 --> 02:10.034
They ain't making it out again.

02:10.067 --> 02:11.667
I don't know, Frank,
not a good idea.

02:11.700 --> 02:13.201
- It's your retirement gift to
- We don't know what...

02:13.234 --> 02:14.867
- yourself.
- We're going in.

02:24.900 --> 02:26.967
One Seven
Five second in touch.

02:27.001 --> 02:28.201
Frank, stand down.

02:29.967 --> 02:31.967
- Take right.
- We stick together.

02:32.001 --> 02:34.368
Take right, I got left.

02:34.401 --> 02:36.401
Three, two, one, go.

03:52.001 --> 03:54.101
- Frank, Frank.
- In here.

03:58.067 --> 03:58.900
Keep pressure on it.

03:58.934 --> 04:00.434
Keep your hands on it.

04:00.468 --> 04:03.867
Officer down, 422
Pine Grove Lane.

04:03.900 --> 04:05.500
- Officer down.
- Dillon.

04:05.533 --> 04:06.434
What?

04:26.034 --> 04:26.867
Morning, sunshine.

04:26.900 --> 04:27.867
You okay?

04:36.468 --> 04:38.034
How can you eat those?

04:38.067 --> 04:40.034
They're not even
part of a food group.

04:40.067 --> 04:41.234
It's good for you.

04:42.134 --> 04:43.800
Just like some much
needed R and R.

04:43.834 --> 04:45.234
Yes, well your idea of R and R

04:45.267 --> 04:47.533
and mine are a little different.

04:47.567 --> 04:48.533
We'll see about that.

05:20.067 --> 05:21.134
Woo hoo.

05:21.167 --> 05:23.867
Hey, baby, I love you.

05:23.900 --> 05:26.900
You ever been with a real man?

05:26.934 --> 05:27.867
Come on, honey.

05:27.900 --> 05:29.934
Come on and marry me.

05:29.967 --> 05:31.533
Me or him?

05:31.567 --> 05:32.900
Howdy doody.

05:35.368 --> 05:36.234
Marry me.

06:16.434 --> 06:18.034
Ready for some chow?

06:18.067 --> 06:19.434
I'm gonna change my dressing.

06:20.401 --> 06:22.101
Well, I will get us a table

06:22.134 --> 06:23.401
because I think this
is our last shot at

06:23.434 --> 06:25.067
civilization for awhile.

06:25.101 --> 06:28.034
Well, you know how
to get me excited.

06:32.667 --> 06:35.001
- Aw, you're such a gentleman.
- Mm-hmm.

06:35.034 --> 06:37.001
- Hey, how y'all doing?
- Hi.

06:37.034 --> 06:38.633
- Just y'all two?
- Just the two of us.

06:38.667 --> 06:39.533
Can I use your restroom?

06:39.567 --> 06:41.434
Yes, sir, it's in
the rear over there.

06:43.001 --> 06:45.401
We're gonna fix you up with
the best seat in the house.

06:45.434 --> 06:46.600
Sounds great to me.

06:50.034 --> 06:50.667
Thank you very much.

06:50.700 --> 06:52.234
You're welcome.

06:52.267 --> 06:53.134
Oh.

06:57.134 --> 07:00.201
- Just give us a holler.
- You got it.

07:31.267 --> 07:32.434
Hey, Butch.

07:32.468 --> 07:33.734
- How's it going, bud?
- I appreciate it.

07:33.767 --> 07:35.368
- All right, all right.
- Feels good.

07:46.134 --> 07:47.434
You know, you
weren't very friendly

07:47.468 --> 07:49.368
out there on that
highway earlier.

07:49.401 --> 07:51.368
Yeah, well you were
being an asshole.

07:54.734 --> 07:56.334
Quite a mouth you got there.

07:57.234 --> 07:58.101
Charmed.

07:59.567 --> 08:02.633
I think I've got something
to shut that mouth, Butch.

08:02.667 --> 08:03.667
Your name is Butch?

08:05.134 --> 08:07.334
You know that's not
actually a real name, right?

08:07.368 --> 08:08.234
Hey.

08:09.700 --> 08:10.600
We got a problem?

08:12.101 --> 08:13.667
Hey, you better
watch yourself, boy.

08:13.700 --> 08:15.267
Hey, Butch, leave
these fine folks alone.

08:15.301 --> 08:16.734
Shut
your mouth, Willie.

08:18.301 --> 08:19.800
We don't want any trouble.

08:19.834 --> 08:21.167
I think you do
want some trouble.

08:21.201 --> 08:22.334
Why don't you swing
on me right now,

08:22.368 --> 08:24.101
you and your big mouth
bitch right there.

08:24.134 --> 08:26.667
Hey, it's not worth it, babe.

08:26.700 --> 08:27.533
Not worth it.

08:27.567 --> 08:29.167
You all has
come here to eat?

08:29.201 --> 08:30.067
Butch.

08:31.167 --> 08:32.034
Yes, Mama.

08:33.234 --> 08:36.134
- Take a seat.
- Yes, Mama.

08:39.301 --> 08:40.167
Come on, hon.

08:41.533 --> 08:43.234
- Nice watch.
- Thanks.

08:50.434 --> 08:54.267
Sorry, not used
to outsiders here.

08:54.301 --> 08:56.434
Especially not good-looking
ones like you two.

08:56.468 --> 08:57.667
Well, thank you, ma'am.

08:57.700 --> 09:00.267
Ah, sugar, call me
Mama, everyone does.

09:00.301 --> 09:01.468
Well, thank you, Mama.

09:03.468 --> 09:06.334
So, what brings you two
to this little community?

09:07.600 --> 09:10.700
We're just traveling,
getting away from work.

09:13.800 --> 09:14.834
Well, that's nice.

09:14.867 --> 09:16.567
But what do you want?

09:16.600 --> 09:17.468
Oh.

09:18.401 --> 09:19.834
Here's your mail, Mama.

09:19.867 --> 09:21.234
Oh, thank you, Randall.

09:22.267 --> 09:23.134
Yes, ma'am.

09:24.334 --> 09:25.834
Now listen, you all
order whatever you want

09:25.867 --> 09:27.368
because it's on Butch.

09:27.401 --> 09:28.301
No, Mama.

09:29.867 --> 09:31.734
What would Jesus do, Butch?

09:34.867 --> 09:35.800
I think we're all right.

09:35.834 --> 09:37.234
We can take care of our own.

09:37.267 --> 09:38.468
Oh, I'm not asking.

09:41.234 --> 09:43.600
Oh, well in that case, I
think I'll have dessert too.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.600
Smart girl.

09:46.633 --> 09:47.567
Thank you, Mama.

09:48.468 --> 09:49.334
Chili dog.

09:50.468 --> 09:51.267
Wow.

09:52.600 --> 09:54.301
Thanks for saving
me back there, babe.

09:54.334 --> 09:55.734
You're my knight
in shining armor.

09:55.767 --> 09:58.600
Oh, I wasn't saving you,
I was saving them from you.

09:58.633 --> 10:00.167
Oh, okay.

10:00.201 --> 10:02.401
I mean, how weird is that?

10:02.434 --> 10:03.468
Butch and...

10:03.500 --> 10:04.867
Mama.

10:24.834 --> 10:25.667
Hey, neighbor.

10:27.368 --> 10:28.700
Morning.

10:28.734 --> 10:29.834
Interest you in some coffee?

10:29.867 --> 10:31.334
I'm good, I appreciate it.

10:31.368 --> 10:32.867
I just saw your fire,
wanted to let you know

10:32.900 --> 10:34.500
it gets real dry up
here this time of year,

10:34.533 --> 10:36.334
so you be sure to
douse those coals.

10:36.368 --> 10:38.368
Mm, will do.

10:38.401 --> 10:41.633
Oh, and by the way, the
locals aren't real friendly

10:41.667 --> 10:44.368
to strangers, so you be
sure to stick to the trails.

10:45.434 --> 10:46.267
Hm.

10:46.301 --> 10:47.600
Cranky locals.

10:47.633 --> 10:48.500
Got it.

10:55.600 --> 10:58.334
Oh my god, you smell that?

10:58.368 --> 11:00.867
I told you, nothing like
the fresh country air.

11:01.834 --> 11:03.900
I was talking about the bacon.

11:03.934 --> 11:05.368
Mm, nice morning breath.

11:14.001 --> 11:15.734
How we feeling?

11:15.767 --> 11:16.633
I'm all good.

11:18.267 --> 11:19.834
How far have we come?

11:19.867 --> 11:21.267
Oh, about 10 clicks.

11:22.533 --> 11:23.368
Really?

11:26.401 --> 11:27.767
About 6.2 miles.

11:28.667 --> 11:30.533
That sounds about right.

11:36.767 --> 11:37.800
All right.

11:37.834 --> 11:38.700
Left or right?

11:40.867 --> 11:42.500
Left.

11:42.533 --> 11:43.934
Left it is.

11:43.967 --> 11:44.834
Come on.

11:46.533 --> 11:47.700
You gotta work on your cardio.

11:50.301 --> 11:51.234
Okay.

11:54.001 --> 11:55.234
- Oh no.
- Yeah.

11:57.434 --> 11:59.600
We're gonna get...

11:59.633 --> 12:00.867
Quick.

12:00.900 --> 12:02.301
Go, go, go, go.

12:09.834 --> 12:11.468
- You okay, hon?
- Yeah.

12:11.500 --> 12:13.633
- Come here, are you sure?
- Eh, it's fine.

12:19.434 --> 12:21.368
It's gonna be awhile.

12:22.867 --> 12:25.633
Oh well, they
have a nice porch.

12:28.567 --> 12:31.468
It should be
dryer inside, huh?

12:31.533 --> 12:32.368
Come on.

12:36.533 --> 12:37.401
Hello?

12:39.834 --> 12:40.834
Hello, hello?

12:42.567 --> 12:43.734
Looks like it's just us.

13:04.600 --> 13:05.468
Oo.

13:07.533 --> 13:08.967
Much better.

13:15.067 --> 13:16.900
Yes, yes, I hear you.

13:16.934 --> 13:18.101
I hear you.

13:18.134 --> 13:20.967
Let me, oh, I hear
you, yes, Lord.

13:21.001 --> 13:21.633
Oh.

13:23.867 --> 13:26.667
The lord has been good to you.

13:26.700 --> 13:28.401
Now you be good to him.

13:33.401 --> 13:36.800
Tithe and tin will get you in.

13:36.834 --> 13:38.533
Can I hear an amen?

13:38.567 --> 13:39.567
All right.

13:39.600 --> 13:41.734
Oh, whoa, all right.

13:43.533 --> 13:46.934
Yes, yes, yes, Lord,
yes, I hear you.

13:46.967 --> 13:48.700
Can I hear an amen?

13:48.734 --> 13:52.600
Yes.

13:53.834 --> 13:56.034
God bless you all,
thank you for coming.

13:56.067 --> 13:58.900
Good to have you,
good to have you.

13:58.934 --> 14:01.134
Look for me next Sunday now.

14:08.468 --> 14:09.767
Good, good.

14:09.800 --> 14:11.001
All right.

14:11.034 --> 14:13.401
Good to see you, thank you for
coming, thank you for coming.

14:13.434 --> 14:15.734
What a wonderful
sermon, pastor.

14:15.767 --> 14:17.800
If it had gone on for
a few more minutes,

14:17.834 --> 14:19.734
I think I might've started
speaking in tongues.

14:19.767 --> 14:22.834
Oh, God bless you, sister,
thank you, thank you.

14:22.867 --> 14:23.934
See you next Sunday.

14:25.934 --> 14:27.500
- Hey.
- Shirley.

14:28.800 --> 14:29.867
Mama.

14:30.734 --> 14:31.900
How you doing?

14:31.934 --> 14:33.700
Oh, I could not
be better, darling.

14:33.734 --> 14:36.567
Now listen, I am gonna
have that apple crisp ready

14:36.600 --> 14:38.101
for that cakewalk next week,

14:38.134 --> 14:39.500
so don't you worry
about a thing, okay?

14:39.533 --> 14:41.533
Okay, you know
I never do, Mama.

14:44.600 --> 14:46.001
Oh,
nothing personal.

14:53.800 --> 14:54.934
Don't you think that

14:54.967 --> 14:57.500
instead of chasing
tail in God's house

14:57.533 --> 14:58.967
that you oughta go
home and make sure

14:59.001 --> 15:01.667
that everything is ready?

15:01.700 --> 15:02.700
Yeah, sorry, Mama.

15:14.567 --> 15:17.434
Stella, you
gotta come by the store,

15:17.468 --> 15:20.401
- your medicine is in.
- Oh, thank heavens.

15:25.101 --> 15:28.900
- Well, the rain stopped.
- Time to head back?

15:28.934 --> 15:30.667
Sure, I'm starving.

15:30.700 --> 15:31.567
Oh.

15:34.034 --> 15:34.900
Seriously?

15:36.734 --> 15:38.468
Gonna need a real
meal after that.

15:41.267 --> 15:43.500
Oh, hon, you should
redress that.

15:44.700 --> 15:45.700
That's your fault.

15:46.834 --> 15:48.101
I'll get the backpack.

15:50.001 --> 15:50.867
I miss you.

16:03.267 --> 16:05.567
Looks like they're trying
to keep somebody out.

16:08.967 --> 16:09.834
Or something in.

16:25.067 --> 16:25.934
Wow.

16:49.900 --> 16:51.667
- Don't do that.
- What are you doing?

16:51.700 --> 16:53.201
I think I found something.

16:53.234 --> 16:55.101
Here, help me move this thing.

16:55.134 --> 16:56.900
No, I will not
be your accomplice.

16:56.934 --> 16:57.834
Come on, we need to leave.

16:57.867 --> 16:58.900
We're already trespassing.

16:58.934 --> 17:00.201
Oh, you're worried
about that now?

17:00.234 --> 17:00.700
I am.

17:00.734 --> 17:01.767
Come on, let's go.

17:03.734 --> 17:05.267
- Oh.
- Nuh-uh, no.

17:06.867 --> 17:08.767
Oh, come on, you're not
the least bit curious?

17:08.800 --> 17:11.067
There's bars on the windows,
there's fortified doors,

17:11.101 --> 17:12.134
and now there's a secret room.

17:12.167 --> 17:13.934
I will be outs...

17:21.800 --> 17:22.934
Oh shit.

17:24.633 --> 17:25.301
Dillon.

17:36.934 --> 17:38.633
We need to get
the hell outta here.

17:51.700 --> 17:52.700
All right.

17:53.401 --> 17:54.767
Let's try this again.

17:58.800 --> 17:59.667
Who sent you?

18:02.001 --> 18:02.900
Nobody.

18:03.767 --> 18:04.934
We're on vacation.

18:08.700 --> 18:13.700
In the middle of
nowhere, vacationing?

18:14.301 --> 18:15.401
Of course you are.

18:21.067 --> 18:22.734
Well, lookie there.

18:24.034 --> 18:25.034
Hey, baby.

18:25.067 --> 18:26.934
Hey, you want some of this?

18:26.967 --> 18:28.301
Hey, don't worry,
you're gonna get yours.

18:28.334 --> 18:29.667
Call me asshole now.

18:29.700 --> 18:31.633
Call me an asshole now.

18:33.201 --> 18:34.800
Butch.

18:34.834 --> 18:37.201
Come on out here and
see what I found.

18:37.234 --> 18:38.734
Shut this bitch up.

18:42.767 --> 18:44.201
Leave her alone.

18:52.134 --> 18:55.934
Well, he ain't the
feds, he's a cop.

18:55.967 --> 18:57.334
Atlanta homicide.

18:57.368 --> 18:59.667
Found his campsite
about seven miles back.

19:01.800 --> 19:02.867
I guess I was wrong.

19:04.767 --> 19:06.234
Did you get rid of his stuff?

19:06.267 --> 19:07.167
Yeah.

19:07.201 --> 19:08.967
Took the jeep, dumped the gear.

19:09.001 --> 19:10.067
Not all of it.

19:21.034 --> 19:21.900
Hey.

19:22.934 --> 19:25.134
I need to apologize to you guys.

19:26.267 --> 19:28.401
I guess you really were
telling me the truth.

19:29.368 --> 19:31.067
You know, I'm sorry.

19:31.101 --> 19:33.267
Sorry I was so mean, you know?

19:33.301 --> 19:35.301
I really am sorry.

19:50.201 --> 19:52.101
Throw 'em in the gully.

20:13.934 --> 20:15.267
- All right, you ready?
- Yeah.

20:15.301 --> 20:16.167
One.

20:17.934 --> 20:18.800
Two.

20:19.767 --> 20:20.434
Three.

20:25.468 --> 20:27.934
You know what,
she's kinda smooth, right?

20:30.301 --> 20:31.900
Are they
really gonna fit your feet?

20:31.934 --> 20:32.900
They're nice boots.

21:08.368 --> 21:11.533
- Hey, hey, Captain Jack.
- Hey, hey, Captain Jack.

21:11.567 --> 21:13.434
Meet me down by
the railroad tracks.

21:13.468 --> 21:15.201
Meet me down
by the railroad tracks.

21:15.234 --> 21:20.201
- With this rifle in my hand.
- With this rifle in my hand.

21:21.067 --> 21:22.301
Let's go, maggots, move it.

21:23.368 --> 21:24.201
Come on.

21:25.533 --> 21:26.468
You want this?

21:30.001 --> 21:31.934
Let's move it, maggots.

21:32.934 --> 21:33.834
Come on, Baker.

21:35.500 --> 21:36.834
We haven't got all day.

21:39.967 --> 21:42.001
You gonna quit, cupcake?

21:42.034 --> 21:44.167
You wanna be a Ranger, soldier?

21:44.201 --> 21:45.567
Rangers don't quit.

21:45.600 --> 21:47.001
Get up.

21:47.034 --> 21:47.900
Get up.

24:18.667 --> 24:20.533
Which
way, left or right?

24:21.800 --> 24:22.667
Left.

24:25.234 --> 24:27.067
No, I will not
be your accomplice.

24:27.101 --> 24:28.001
Come on, we need to leave.

24:28.034 --> 24:29.134
We're already trespassing.

25:26.500 --> 25:27.600
It's too damn early.

25:30.767 --> 25:33.134
I slept like shit last night.

26:00.834 --> 26:04.667
- Hey, morning, Butch.
- Coffee.

26:04.700 --> 26:05.633
Hey, what the hell?

26:05.667 --> 26:07.201
Do you have to go pick the beans

26:07.234 --> 26:09.301
before you bring
my freaking coffee?

26:10.800 --> 26:12.533
Did you put sugar in that?

26:12.567 --> 26:13.434
Yeah.

26:25.401 --> 26:27.700
I told you we should've
kept that pretty camper.

26:27.734 --> 26:29.368
Might've been helpful
around the kitchen.

26:29.401 --> 26:31.734
Since when do you start
caring about cooking, boy?

26:31.767 --> 26:33.567
As long as she can
cook in the bedroom,

26:33.600 --> 26:34.667
that's all we care about.

26:34.700 --> 26:36.201
Ain't that right, girl?

26:37.267 --> 26:39.700
Cleetus, you keep your
hillbilly hands to yourself

26:39.734 --> 26:41.334
or I'll kick your ass.

26:41.368 --> 26:43.567
Hey, I didn't mean
nothing by it, Butch.

26:43.600 --> 26:46.267
Just having fun.

26:46.301 --> 26:48.533
I didn't mean
nothing by it, Butch.

26:48.567 --> 26:49.867
- Shut up.
- You gonna get

26:49.900 --> 26:51.101
your ass kicked.

26:51.368 --> 26:53.234
- Mama.
- Yes, boss?

26:53.267 --> 26:54.500
Butch.

26:54.533 --> 26:57.500
Y'all eat up now, you
got business to do.

26:57.533 --> 26:58.533
Yes, Mama.

27:24.334 --> 27:25.468
You satisfied?

27:27.434 --> 27:28.301
Always.

27:28.334 --> 27:29.533
Mama don't mess around.

27:39.434 --> 27:40.667
You're not gonna check it?

27:43.834 --> 27:45.934
That's between you and Mama.

27:45.967 --> 27:47.834
I don't think you're
gonna short her.

27:49.001 --> 27:50.401
Not her.

27:50.434 --> 27:51.334
Pack it up, boys.

28:11.267 --> 28:12.500
I thought you were dead.

28:14.500 --> 28:16.267
Thinking isn't
your strong suit.

28:19.700 --> 28:20.967
Where are the rest of you?

28:59.368 --> 29:00.234
Dillon?

29:07.034 --> 29:10.867
We need to get
the hell outta here.

29:21.800 --> 29:23.734
Who sent you?

30:24.600 --> 30:27.101
Transaction went good, Mama.

30:27.134 --> 30:28.734
That's good, baby, thank you.

30:29.834 --> 30:31.700
Woo hoo.

30:31.734 --> 30:35.001
Oo wee, how to speak French.

30:35.034 --> 30:37.067
Hey, let's get fancy
there, college boy.

30:37.101 --> 30:38.401
Give it back, A-hole.

30:39.734 --> 30:43.700
Tell me, how do you say
I'm a wussy in French?

30:49.633 --> 30:50.567
Le Butch?

30:51.468 --> 30:52.867
Ah, ah, ah.

30:52.900 --> 30:56.067
Y'all stop being ugly
with one another now.

30:57.167 --> 31:00.401
Butch, give Lawrence
back his book.

31:03.934 --> 31:05.767
Sorry, Mama.

31:10.134 --> 31:12.468
Come on, baby, sit down.

31:38.201 --> 31:39.667
How does it look?

31:39.700 --> 31:41.101
Eh, good enough.

31:46.567 --> 31:47.967
You fucking serious with that?

31:50.134 --> 31:51.401
I'ma go take a piss.

31:52.533 --> 31:53.633
Don't hurt yourself.

32:20.001 --> 32:21.167
Jesse, it's ready.

32:21.201 --> 32:23.234
Why don't you go
get me another jug?

32:41.767 --> 32:44.167
If you cut me, you die, bitch.

32:55.734 --> 32:57.734
You killed my husband.

32:57.767 --> 32:58.767
You all die.

33:14.667 --> 33:16.101
You killed Earl.

33:16.134 --> 33:19.067
You're gonna take me
to the rest of your clan.

33:19.101 --> 33:22.267
Kiss my freckled ass,
I ain't telling you shit.

33:22.301 --> 33:24.734
I thought you might say
something stupid like that.

33:27.001 --> 33:27.900
You whore.

33:28.967 --> 33:29.900
Clock's ticking.

33:32.034 --> 33:33.667
Go to hell.

33:33.700 --> 33:36.201
You're more afraid
of Butch than me, huh?

33:36.234 --> 33:37.834
You know nothing.

33:37.867 --> 33:40.800
Butch is just an errand boy.

34:10.633 --> 34:11.867
Run, rabbit, run.

34:47.201 --> 34:48.334
Hey.

35:13.167 --> 35:15.334
Go see what those
two idiots are up to.

35:15.368 --> 35:16.368
Yes, Mama.

36:17.967 --> 36:18.834
Hey.

36:21.434 --> 36:23.267
What the hell did you do?

36:23.301 --> 36:24.468
It wasn't me.

36:24.500 --> 36:26.934
It was that bitch,
she's still alive.

36:26.967 --> 36:28.234
She killed Earl.

36:29.334 --> 36:30.434
Help me get this off.

36:30.468 --> 36:31.500
Get in the car.

36:31.533 --> 36:33.900
Get your ass in the car.

36:40.267 --> 36:43.134
Don't get blood
all over my seats.

36:56.234 --> 37:01.234
What the?

37:16.567 --> 37:19.234
- What happened?
- Bitch got me.

37:22.401 --> 37:23.267
Easy.

38:02.134 --> 38:05.934
You have one simple task
and you couldn't handle it.

38:07.101 --> 38:10.001
You shot that jezebel
and she's still alive.

38:13.134 --> 38:14.067
Better fix this.

38:16.167 --> 38:17.034
Yes, Mama.

38:22.368 --> 38:23.234
Patch him up.

38:28.600 --> 38:30.867
Go see what you can find
out about this girl.

38:37.368 --> 38:39.001
Brenner Leigh Baker.

38:46.600 --> 38:50.267
NCAA national
champion 100 meters.

38:58.201 --> 39:00.001
Runner-up pentathlon.

39:02.234 --> 39:03.368
Holy crap.

39:04.401 --> 39:06.867
Hey...

39:06.900 --> 39:08.533
First female Ranger.

39:09.600 --> 39:10.468
Hm.

39:12.001 --> 39:13.201
Isn't that special?

39:46.401 --> 39:49.401
Sheriff
Hobbs to dispatch.

39:51.167 --> 39:52.667
Go ahead, Sheriff Hobbs.

39:52.700 --> 39:54.101
Send Briggs and Paul

39:54.134 --> 39:56.201
down to County Road
75 and Miller Road.

39:57.201 --> 39:58.067
I've got a body.

39:59.167 --> 40:00.034
Copy that.

40:30.167 --> 40:32.001
That's Earl Pitts.

40:32.034 --> 40:34.067
He's part of that
clan up in the hills.

40:34.101 --> 40:35.234
Mama's clan.

40:35.267 --> 40:36.267
What?

40:36.301 --> 40:37.633
They all call her Mama.

40:37.667 --> 40:40.267
She owns all this
land, 10,000 acres,

40:40.301 --> 40:42.667
and the Country Cafe on 56.

40:42.700 --> 40:45.434
They live by a different
set of rules up there.

40:45.468 --> 40:48.500
Old Sheriff Sanders had
us steer clear of her.

40:48.533 --> 40:50.101
Well, I ain't Sanders.

40:50.134 --> 40:51.267
Now, let's go see Mama.

40:56.667 --> 40:57.533
Let's go, boys.

41:10.633 --> 41:11.468
Mama.

41:12.700 --> 41:16.101
Earl is dead and Sheriff Hobbs
is on his way out to see you.

41:18.767 --> 41:21.633
Get that bitch and make her pay.

41:35.834 --> 41:37.600
Can I help you, Sheriff Hobbs?

41:39.533 --> 41:43.234
Well, here to tell you one
of your men was found dead.

41:43.267 --> 41:44.500
Yeah.

41:44.533 --> 41:45.533
Poor Earl.

41:46.468 --> 41:47.800
He'd been real depressed lately.

41:47.834 --> 41:50.767
I was afraid something
like this might happen.

41:52.067 --> 41:53.167
What are you saying?

41:54.834 --> 41:56.567
He took his own life.

41:58.267 --> 42:00.234
You're saying he
committed suicide,

42:00.267 --> 42:02.401
stabbed himself in
the ribcage six times?

42:03.834 --> 42:04.967
It's real sad.

42:05.001 --> 42:08.267
Butch and Jesse saw the whole
thing, didn't you, boys?

42:08.301 --> 42:09.267
Yeah, that's right.

42:09.301 --> 42:11.800
Jesse's still
real tore up about it.

42:11.834 --> 42:13.667
I just wish we
had been quicker.

42:15.334 --> 42:17.134
Fire broke out at
our old fishing shack

42:17.167 --> 42:18.368
and we was tending to it.

42:19.334 --> 42:20.600
You mean still, right?

42:22.834 --> 42:24.401
No, sir.

42:24.434 --> 42:26.600
Just an old shack we
kept our fishing gear at.

42:28.567 --> 42:32.167
Now, if that's all, sheriff,
we got funeral arrangements

42:32.867 --> 42:34.101
to attend to.

42:35.800 --> 42:38.567
Well, I'll need a statement,

42:38.600 --> 42:40.567
but you can pick up the body
from the coroner's office

42:40.600 --> 42:42.201
after the autopsy.

42:42.234 --> 42:42.867
I know.

42:42.900 --> 42:43.734
Bill's my cousin.

42:43.767 --> 42:44.767
He already called me.

42:46.700 --> 42:48.368
Okay.

42:48.401 --> 42:51.334
Briggs, Paul, let's go.

42:59.533 --> 43:01.600
I don't want that sheriff
anywhere around here.

43:01.633 --> 43:02.667
You understand me?

43:04.533 --> 43:07.134
Tonight, we celebrate Earl.

43:08.834 --> 43:11.334
Tomorrow morning, I want you
to bring me that bitch's head.

43:12.301 --> 43:13.201
Yes, Mama.

43:25.167 --> 43:27.700
Butch, you heard from Carl?

43:27.734 --> 43:29.734
Yeah, he's dropping
off a shipment.

43:29.767 --> 43:30.834
He's on his way back.

43:31.767 --> 43:33.334
Good.

43:33.368 --> 43:35.301
And Cleetus,
he hasn't checked in yet.

43:36.334 --> 43:37.734
- Check on him later.
- Yeah.

43:39.334 --> 43:40.201
Okay.

43:43.734 --> 43:44.600
To Earl.

43:45.900 --> 43:48.468
He was a good boy.

43:48.500 --> 43:49.700
He was my boy.

44:05.533 --> 44:08.334
College boy,
learn to be a man.

44:09.368 --> 44:10.533
You're gonna be a man.

44:10.567 --> 44:11.800
Fight me with a stick.

44:11.834 --> 44:13.234
Fight me with a stick for Earl.

44:13.267 --> 44:13.967
Come on.

44:14.001 --> 44:15.167
Butch, don't play like that.

44:15.201 --> 44:17.667
Pick it up and fight
me with a stick right now.

44:17.700 --> 44:18.867
- Pick it up.
- Come on.

44:18.900 --> 44:20.767
- Pick it up.
- Pit it up and fight me

44:20.800 --> 44:22.633
with a stick right now.

44:22.667 --> 44:24.201
- Shut up.
- Screw you guys.

44:24.234 --> 44:25.234
I'm going to bed.

44:26.767 --> 44:28.368
Go cry into Mama's lap.

44:31.734 --> 44:32.800
All right, sing along.

44:34.468 --> 44:35.867
♪ Earl ♪

44:35.900 --> 44:38.667
Earl, we love you,
we love you, buddy.

44:38.700 --> 44:40.767
Earl, I can't
play worth a shit.

44:58.001 --> 44:58.867
Earl.

45:05.633 --> 45:08.201
Fuck y'all, I'm going to bed.

48:15.600 --> 48:16.700
Please.

48:16.734 --> 48:19.533
Don't put me in
there, please, don't.

49:08.167 --> 49:09.167
It's okay.

49:18.700 --> 49:19.700
Oh god no.

49:23.034 --> 49:24.500
I'm gonna get you
out of here, okay?

49:24.533 --> 49:25.667
No, please, they'll hurt us.

49:25.700 --> 49:27.967
They'll hurt us, please, no.

49:28.001 --> 49:32.967
Not if we stay quiet, okay?

49:45.301 --> 49:46.234
Stay quiet.

49:47.867 --> 49:48.700
It's okay.

49:48.734 --> 49:49.600
Okay.

49:50.301 --> 49:51.700
Quick, come on.

49:53.234 --> 49:54.834
Follow me, okay?

50:09.234 --> 50:11.234
Watch out for him, okay?

50:19.667 --> 50:20.533
Come here.

50:21.934 --> 50:23.267
Quick, come on.

50:28.867 --> 50:30.267
She's taking us.

50:31.234 --> 50:32.101
Help.

50:34.667 --> 50:35.301
Go.

50:35.334 --> 50:36.600
Run, run, go.

50:49.967 --> 50:51.067
Shit.

50:51.101 --> 50:52.334
Go, go, go, go, go.

50:52.368 --> 50:53.900
Go.

50:53.934 --> 50:54.967
Head south.

50:55.001 --> 50:56.800
Cut 'em off at the river.

50:56.834 --> 50:58.700
Go, go, go.

51:23.368 --> 51:24.234
Butch is dead.

51:25.767 --> 51:27.301
What happened, boy?

51:27.334 --> 51:29.934
I don't know, but she's here.

51:29.967 --> 51:30.834
The Army girl.

51:33.001 --> 51:33.867
Over here.

51:35.800 --> 51:36.667
Keep moving.

51:53.034 --> 51:55.101
You say Carl's
after her, right?

51:55.134 --> 51:56.368
Yeah.

51:56.401 --> 51:57.301
Carl will get her.

51:58.900 --> 52:01.967
Call Hank and
get the dogs ready.

52:08.401 --> 52:09.267
Emily.

52:11.767 --> 52:12.401
It's okay.

52:15.001 --> 52:18.001
Get your ass over
here, girl, now.

52:18.034 --> 52:19.234
No, they don't own you.

52:19.267 --> 52:20.934
I don't know
who you think you are,

52:20.967 --> 52:24.201
but you ain't no different
than the rest of these bitches.

52:25.734 --> 52:27.167
You're right.

52:27.201 --> 52:28.767
No better.

52:28.800 --> 52:29.667
No worse.

52:45.867 --> 52:46.834
Bitch.

52:49.267 --> 52:50.900
Shit.

52:50.934 --> 52:51.800
Go, go, go, go.

53:27.867 --> 53:28.734
Hey, Mama.

53:34.867 --> 53:35.734
Damn.

53:37.834 --> 53:39.034
That's hardcore.

53:39.067 --> 53:40.201
Hardcore, huh?

53:51.434 --> 53:54.434
If we keep heading west,
we'll hit the highway.

53:54.468 --> 53:58.101
How do you know
all of these things?

54:00.201 --> 54:02.234
You mean kill a man
with my bare hands?

54:06.834 --> 54:10.167
I was in the military
for some time.

54:10.201 --> 54:11.267
Like the Army?

54:14.267 --> 54:15.134
Not quite.

54:17.900 --> 54:21.401
Do you think maybe you
could teach me some stuff?

54:25.834 --> 54:27.234
Sure.

54:27.267 --> 54:28.334
It might take some time.

54:31.301 --> 54:33.267
Listen, I'm gonna
get you out of here

54:33.301 --> 54:35.533
and you'll get your
life back, okay?

54:35.567 --> 54:38.167
I just need you to hang
on a little while longer.

54:39.533 --> 54:44.533
I don't have a life.

54:45.201 --> 54:45.900
I'm pregnant.

54:46.900 --> 54:48.067
It's Butch's baby.

54:49.001 --> 54:50.267
Which means it's Mama's.

54:52.267 --> 54:54.834
They won't stop
till they catch me.

54:54.867 --> 54:56.167
Emily, I'm so sorry.

54:57.934 --> 55:01.167
You're the first person to
treat me decent in a long time.

55:02.468 --> 55:05.001
Listen to me, you girls

55:05.034 --> 55:07.201
don't deserve what
happened to you.

55:07.234 --> 55:09.101
There's not a chance
I'm leaving you.

55:11.434 --> 55:16.001
I'm not the first and I
definitely won't be the last.

55:17.067 --> 55:18.034
What do you mean?

55:20.001 --> 55:22.134
Every few months,
there's a shipment.

55:23.234 --> 55:25.834
They sell us in places
with other girls.

55:26.934 --> 55:28.401
And sometimes there's
upwards of 15,

55:28.434 --> 55:30.034
but they're quickly taken away.

55:32.134 --> 55:34.867
Connie is the only one that's
been there a long time.

55:37.001 --> 55:40.034
I promise you, once
I'm done with them,

55:40.067 --> 55:42.134
they will never
hurt another girl.

55:43.667 --> 55:44.500
Okay?

55:48.101 --> 55:48.967
You hungry?

55:50.101 --> 55:51.533
Tastes better than
it looks, I promise.

56:15.101 --> 56:18.167
Mail Man, we got
one, bring her in.

56:20.234 --> 56:24.234
Hey.

56:37.700 --> 56:39.134
Hands in the air.

56:39.567 --> 56:41.034
In the air, now.

56:42.267 --> 56:43.468
We're on the same side.

56:45.600 --> 56:47.267
You, on the ground.

57:02.001 --> 57:02.633
Let's go.

57:02.667 --> 57:03.633
No, wait.

57:03.667 --> 57:05.234
Stop.

57:15.368 --> 57:16.500
You're gonna be okay.

57:19.134 --> 57:20.134
Yeah.

57:20.167 --> 57:21.533
Who are you?

57:21.567 --> 57:23.234
Don't worry about it.

57:23.267 --> 57:24.567
Take a deep breath.

57:24.600 --> 57:25.468
Ready?

57:29.434 --> 57:31.134
Put pressure on it, all right?

57:31.167 --> 57:32.067
Let's go.

57:32.101 --> 57:34.134
Wait, we can't leave him.

57:34.167 --> 57:35.401
They'll kill him.

57:35.434 --> 57:36.934
Not our problem.

57:38.134 --> 57:39.001
Neither was I.

57:41.700 --> 57:42.533
Come on.

57:42.567 --> 57:44.167
We have to hurry.

58:02.134 --> 58:04.267
Glen, we're on 'em.

58:04.301 --> 58:05.167
Get the dogs.

58:06.134 --> 58:06.967
Come on.

58:12.700 --> 58:14.134
No.

58:14.167 --> 58:15.201
I can't make it.

58:15.234 --> 58:16.533
- Let's keep going.
- No, stop.

58:17.434 --> 58:18.301
No, no.

58:21.700 --> 58:22.600
Okay, back here.

58:25.401 --> 58:26.267
Back here.

58:30.567 --> 58:32.101
Go through here.

58:32.134 --> 58:33.001
Come on.

58:34.834 --> 58:35.800
Follow me.

58:35.834 --> 58:36.767
Be careful.

58:40.500 --> 58:41.533
Over here.

58:41.567 --> 58:42.434
Get in there.

58:47.600 --> 58:49.301
Stay here and we'll divert them.

58:52.700 --> 58:54.201
What the hell is going on?

58:54.234 --> 58:56.134
Just know I'm one
of the good guys.

58:58.301 --> 59:00.067
Wait for them to pass
and then get out of here

59:00.101 --> 59:01.134
or they will kill you.

59:01.167 --> 59:03.234
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

59:04.567 --> 59:05.567
Good luck.

59:06.434 --> 59:07.301
Okay.

59:29.633 --> 59:30.500
Okay.

59:47.201 --> 59:48.500
It's okay.

59:51.767 --> 59:52.800
Come on.

1:00:12.834 --> 1:00:13.767
They're heading to the river.

1:00:26.567 --> 1:00:28.600
Okay, let's cross the river.

1:00:45.767 --> 1:00:46.633
Come on.

1:01:37.600 --> 1:01:38.401
Come on.

1:01:38.434 --> 1:01:39.267
Come on.

1:01:39.300 --> 1:01:39.967
Hup, hup.

1:02:02.401 --> 1:02:03.434
Out of the car.

1:02:03.468 --> 1:02:04.567
Hands up, now.

1:02:11.734 --> 1:02:12.567
Whoa.

1:02:14.800 --> 1:02:16.434
Oh, thank God.

1:02:16.468 --> 1:02:17.600
Emily, in the car.

1:02:17.633 --> 1:02:18.800
Back in the car.

1:02:18.834 --> 1:02:19.667
Let's go.

1:02:22.834 --> 1:02:25.401
Oh my god, what the
hell happened to y'all?

1:02:26.567 --> 1:02:28.600
No time to explain,
just get us into town.

1:02:28.633 --> 1:02:29.967
We're about two hours out.

1:02:31.600 --> 1:02:33.301
No, wait, the sheriff.

1:02:33.334 --> 1:02:35.267
We left him upriver and
he's really badly injured.

1:02:35.301 --> 1:02:36.600
You have to send help now.

1:02:39.533 --> 1:02:40.533
It's okay.

1:02:42.468 --> 1:02:44.667
I'll send somebody for him.

1:02:59.500 --> 1:03:01.900
Get away from her.

1:03:09.101 --> 1:03:09.967
Enough.

1:03:11.500 --> 1:03:14.067
Oh, now you want to
be the hero, asshole?

1:03:14.101 --> 1:03:14.967
Enough?

1:03:16.434 --> 1:03:17.800
I say when it's enough.

1:03:19.101 --> 1:03:22.468
Sorry, Mama, I just
figured you wanted her alive.

1:03:22.500 --> 1:03:23.734
You figured right,

1:03:23.767 --> 1:03:25.767
but you don't talk
to my boys like that.

1:03:28.900 --> 1:03:29.800
I gotta go.

1:03:31.633 --> 1:03:33.434
Smartest thing you've said.

1:03:36.767 --> 1:03:38.633
Bring 'em up to the house.

1:03:38.667 --> 1:03:42.001
- No, Bren, Bren.
- It's okay, it's okay.

1:03:52.034 --> 1:03:53.533
All right, all
right, all right.

1:03:53.567 --> 1:03:54.468
Settle down.

1:04:01.468 --> 1:04:02.767
Hey.

1:04:05.101 --> 1:04:06.734
All right.

1:04:06.767 --> 1:04:08.034
Just get her up.

1:04:18.834 --> 1:04:19.700
Emily.

1:04:23.567 --> 1:04:25.567
I took you in off the streets.

1:04:26.700 --> 1:04:28.401
I fed you, I clothed you.

1:04:29.800 --> 1:04:33.134
I treated you just
like one of my own.

1:04:34.700 --> 1:04:36.034
And this is how you repay me?

1:04:39.633 --> 1:04:40.967
I sentence you to death.

1:04:41.001 --> 1:04:42.001
What?

1:04:42.034 --> 1:04:43.734
No, no, Mama, please, don't.

1:04:43.767 --> 1:04:44.800
It was me.

1:04:46.900 --> 1:04:47.767
I took her.

1:04:49.900 --> 1:04:52.401
Thought I could use
her against you.

1:04:52.434 --> 1:04:53.101
Excuse me?

1:04:54.633 --> 1:04:56.468
Use her to get me out of here.

1:05:01.034 --> 1:05:04.600
So you're telling me that
she didn't wanna leave?

1:05:05.900 --> 1:05:07.734
That you forced her?

1:05:10.734 --> 1:05:13.767
I told her if she got
me out of this hellhole,

1:05:13.800 --> 1:05:16.134
she could start a new
life for her and her baby.

1:05:18.234 --> 1:05:20.834
She wanted to stay, I
didn't give her a choice.

1:05:23.567 --> 1:05:24.800
She's with child?

1:05:26.234 --> 1:05:27.101
Yes, Mama.

1:05:28.533 --> 1:05:29.600
It's Butch's.

1:05:32.066 --> 1:05:34.001
Put her back in rotation.

1:05:51.500 --> 1:05:52.334
Now, for you.

1:05:53.734 --> 1:05:56.567
You trespass on my
land, you kill my boys,

1:05:56.600 --> 1:06:00.001
you mess up my operation,
and you cost me money.

1:06:01.600 --> 1:06:05.800
As Jesus died for our sins,
so shall you die for yours.

1:06:07.201 --> 1:06:09.500
Such a poetic judgment.

1:06:09.533 --> 1:06:13.034
Oh, no, I will
not be judging you.

1:06:13.067 --> 1:06:15.134
That's a job for
my lord and savior.

1:06:16.667 --> 1:06:19.867
And I shall be judged too when
I come to the pearly gates,

1:06:19.900 --> 1:06:21.934
but today's not my judgment day.

1:06:23.101 --> 1:06:25.468
Today's your sentencing day.

1:06:29.600 --> 1:06:31.867
The last thing
you're ever gonna see

1:06:33.001 --> 1:06:35.533
is my bullet in
between your eyes.

1:06:37.101 --> 1:06:37.967
Oh, darling.

1:06:38.934 --> 1:06:40.134
You are so sweet.

1:06:43.067 --> 1:06:44.067
Lock her up.

1:06:49.334 --> 1:06:50.533
Nice watch.

1:06:51.967 --> 1:06:52.967
Thank you.

1:06:53.001 --> 1:06:54.934
It was a gift from Jesse.

1:06:56.034 --> 1:06:57.967
You remember Jesse, don't you?

1:06:59.067 --> 1:07:00.134
Not really.

1:07:00.167 --> 1:07:02.533
All you mouth-breathers
look the same.

1:07:04.667 --> 1:07:06.633
Baby, that's perfect.

1:07:11.900 --> 1:07:13.167
Grab her arms.

1:07:25.734 --> 1:07:27.800
You always take me
to the nicest places.

1:07:37.900 --> 1:07:40.767
Oh, she's bad, no, she's bad.

1:07:40.800 --> 1:07:43.267
Boy, I sure would like to
take a run at that skank.

1:07:43.301 --> 1:07:45.800
You better keep your
hands to yourself, boy.

1:07:45.834 --> 1:07:47.734
Mama will skin you alive.

1:07:47.767 --> 1:07:49.267
Mama don't care.

1:07:49.301 --> 1:07:51.767
I tell you, I'm gonna
have me some fun tonight.

1:07:52.900 --> 1:07:55.334
That girl will eat
you up and shit you out.

1:07:55.368 --> 1:07:57.934
She's hogtied and hanging
like a skinned deer.

1:07:57.967 --> 1:07:59.567
I think I could handle her.

1:08:00.301 --> 1:08:01.900
I bet Butch thought so too.

1:08:02.934 --> 1:08:04.934
Vince, your turn to babysit.

1:08:06.167 --> 1:08:08.734
What's Mama keeping
her around for anyhow?

1:08:08.767 --> 1:08:11.101
Gonna break her,
put her in rotation.

1:08:11.134 --> 1:08:13.067
You ain't breaking that filly.

1:08:13.101 --> 1:08:16.834
Mama better put her
down and I mean quick.

1:08:16.867 --> 1:08:18.834
Hank says Mom
can break anybody.

1:08:22.667 --> 1:08:25.201
Vince, get your ass inside.

1:08:26.334 --> 1:08:28.667
Glen, go and feed the dogs.

1:08:29.368 --> 1:08:30.767
I just sat down.

1:08:31.834 --> 1:08:33.800
I don't care.

1:08:33.834 --> 1:08:35.001
Go feed the dogs.

1:08:42.867 --> 1:08:46.001
This right here, man,
to Mail Man, I'm clean.

1:08:46.034 --> 1:08:46.900
Cheers.

1:08:48.434 --> 1:08:50.267
How he gonna break her?

1:08:58.934 --> 1:09:00.167
How long have you known?

1:09:05.301 --> 1:09:09.401
I wasn't sure until last week.

1:09:14.468 --> 1:09:18.034
If you think I believe that
bullshit story that she told,

1:09:18.067 --> 1:09:20.034
then you're even
dumber than I thought.

1:09:21.167 --> 1:09:23.368
And I don't think it's possible.

1:09:23.401 --> 1:09:24.734
Mama...

1:09:24.767 --> 1:09:26.267
Shut that whore
mouth of yours.

1:09:26.301 --> 1:09:28.368
Only kept you around
here because of Butch.

1:09:29.500 --> 1:09:33.167
When that baby's
done, you're done.

1:09:37.500 --> 1:09:40.234
Now, you feed my boys.

1:10:18.034 --> 1:10:19.401
Baker, Brenner.

1:10:21.101 --> 1:10:23.767
75th Ranger Division.

1:10:23.800 --> 1:10:28.800
Zero, zero, three, eight,
four, seven, five, six, three.

1:10:30.167 --> 1:10:31.368
Baker, Brenner.

1:10:33.001 --> 1:10:35.434
75th Ranger Division.

1:10:35.468 --> 1:10:40.434
Zero, zero, three, eight,
four, seven, five, six, three.

1:11:03.067 --> 1:11:03.934
Drink.

1:11:06.468 --> 1:11:07.301
Drink.

1:11:27.900 --> 1:11:28.533
Sorry.

1:11:29.468 --> 1:11:30.334
It's okay.

1:11:31.301 --> 1:11:32.401
Thanks.

1:11:32.434 --> 1:11:34.067
What the hell
are you doing, boy?

1:11:35.500 --> 1:11:36.967
I'm sorry, Vince.

1:11:37.867 --> 1:11:38.867
Hey.

1:11:38.900 --> 1:11:39.800
Pick this crap up.

1:11:43.167 --> 1:11:45.001
I better not catch
you back in here.

1:11:47.900 --> 1:11:49.368
You're real tough, aren't you?

1:11:50.934 --> 1:11:52.034
Shut up, skank.

1:11:52.067 --> 1:11:53.334
Oh, and articulate.

1:11:55.633 --> 1:11:56.500
Oh.

1:11:59.267 --> 1:12:01.034
Is she okay?

1:12:01.067 --> 1:12:02.434
Yeah, she's fine.

1:12:06.134 --> 1:12:07.201
Oh.

1:12:22.334 --> 1:12:24.001
You're all like cockroaches.

1:12:25.201 --> 1:12:28.267
I kill one of you,
two more show up.

1:12:29.900 --> 1:12:32.334
What are you, like,
cockroach number nine?

1:12:33.900 --> 1:12:36.468
I don't give a shit about
you or your dead husband.

1:12:38.067 --> 1:12:40.034
If I had been there,
you'd be dead too.

1:12:42.067 --> 1:12:43.201
Why don't you come here

1:12:43.234 --> 1:12:44.500
and put your money
where your mouth is?

1:12:49.301 --> 1:12:51.234
Girl,
you're making me hard.

1:12:57.067 --> 1:12:58.434
Vince.

1:12:58.468 --> 1:12:59.600
Your breakfast is ready.

1:12:59.633 --> 1:13:01.401
Don't you see I'm
having a moment?

1:13:06.334 --> 1:13:07.201
Sorry.

1:13:09.301 --> 1:13:10.900
You don't want it to get cold.

1:13:13.334 --> 1:13:14.167
You'll do.

1:13:16.101 --> 1:13:18.401
Stop struggling, you
know you want it.

1:13:18.434 --> 1:13:21.167
- Vince, stop.
- Hey, shit-stain.

1:13:23.167 --> 1:13:25.533
Why don't you stop
messing with girls

1:13:25.567 --> 1:13:27.401
and see what a real
woman feels like?

1:13:28.734 --> 1:13:30.234
Oh, you want some, bitch?

1:13:31.700 --> 1:13:33.134
Well, you're gonna get it.

1:13:35.167 --> 1:13:36.434
Oo.

1:13:36.468 --> 1:13:38.234
This is gonna be good.

1:13:50.034 --> 1:13:51.700
Emily, listen to me.

1:13:53.500 --> 1:13:54.368
Emily.

1:13:55.301 --> 1:13:56.633
Emily.

1:13:58.767 --> 1:14:00.101
It's okay.

1:14:00.134 --> 1:14:01.500
You're okay.

1:14:01.533 --> 1:14:03.700
Get the knife and cut
me down, all right?

1:14:17.500 --> 1:14:19.167
Get the first aid kit.

1:14:23.101 --> 1:14:24.500
Give me the knife.

1:14:45.800 --> 1:14:47.368
Okay, go hide under the bed.

1:14:52.800 --> 1:14:53.667
Wait.

1:14:55.500 --> 1:14:57.734
Where are you going?

1:14:57.767 --> 1:14:59.101
To clean house.

1:15:00.101 --> 1:15:02.101
Me some of that pie, man.

1:17:33.667 --> 1:17:37.567
I'll give you
this, you are resilient.

1:17:38.667 --> 1:17:41.334
Not resilient enough.

1:17:47.633 --> 1:17:50.334
I'll make this
quick and clean.

1:17:52.967 --> 1:17:55.368
A soldier's death.

1:18:59.667 --> 1:19:01.800
You get one chance.

1:19:01.834 --> 1:19:03.633
- Okay, all right.
- Do you understand?

1:19:03.667 --> 1:19:06.434
I never want to see
your face again.

1:19:07.867 --> 1:19:11.900
Well, I must say,
you are very, very...

1:19:11.934 --> 1:19:13.734
Resilient?

1:19:13.767 --> 1:19:16.900
Yeah, I've heard that.

1:19:16.934 --> 1:19:18.667
And a smartass too.

1:19:20.468 --> 1:19:21.500
Just stop.

1:19:22.667 --> 1:19:24.401
You have no one left.

1:19:24.434 --> 1:19:25.967
Just let her go and we'll leave.

1:19:27.533 --> 1:19:31.067
I knew you tainted
her, brainwashed her.

1:19:31.101 --> 1:19:33.401
But you're wrong about me
not having anybody left.

1:19:39.834 --> 1:19:41.067
No.

1:19:57.834 --> 1:19:59.834
You didn't deserve this.

1:20:03.867 --> 1:20:04.934
I'm so sorry.

1:21:13.567 --> 1:21:16.468
Here's the last box
of evidence, boss.

1:21:17.900 --> 1:21:19.567
I ordered you a
sandwich from the deli.

1:21:19.600 --> 1:21:21.101
It should be here in 20 minutes.

1:21:22.500 --> 1:21:24.767
Now, Suzy from the
deli is also delivering

1:21:24.800 --> 1:21:26.734
to Joe from the auto body shop,

1:21:26.767 --> 1:21:29.401
and when I say delivering,
I mean delivering.

1:21:29.434 --> 1:21:30.101
Thank you, Bethany.

1:21:30.134 --> 1:21:31.934
That'll be all.

1:21:31.967 --> 1:21:32.967
I'm just saying.

1:21:39.100 --> 1:21:40.700
Sheriff Hobbs.

1:21:40.734 --> 1:21:44.101
Be ready, I may
need you from time to time.
