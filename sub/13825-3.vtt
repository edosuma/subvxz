WEBVTT

01:21.331 --> 01:24.417
You better be a good pussycat
for Pet Day, Thomas.

01:33.384 --> 01:38.807
Now behave,
or we won't win the gold star.

01:38.807 --> 01:40.099
Why, hello there.

01:40.099 --> 01:41.935
It's awfully nice to meet you.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.729
My name is Bartholomew J. Bunny.

01:44.729 --> 01:47.607
I bet you can't guess
what the J stands for.

01:48.149 --> 01:50.568
I'll give you a hint, it's Jerald.

01:50.568 --> 01:53.363
Although Jerald
is usually spelled with a G.

01:53.363 --> 01:55.114
I was named by my mama.

01:55.615 --> 01:58.034
She has the most outrageous
sense of humor.

01:58.034 --> 02:01.204
Maybe that's where I get
my dynamic personality.

02:01.204 --> 02:06.543
Anyhoo, my mama says
we're a shoo-in for the gold star.

02:06.543 --> 02:08.378
Oh, Bobby.

02:08.378 --> 02:11.548
He's adorable.

02:11.548 --> 02:13.883
Once I get in front of the class...

02:13.883 --> 02:17.137
...and dazzle them
with my awesome star power...

02:17.595 --> 02:21.558
...the top prize
will be all me-o mine-o.

02:21.558 --> 02:24.102
But I wouldn't feel too bad
if I were you.

02:24.102 --> 02:26.396
I'm sure you're a very nice kitty.

02:33.486 --> 02:34.529
Behave yourself.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.740
You show that mouse you're sorry.

02:39.325 --> 02:41.744
Go on.

02:51.796 --> 02:54.173
Spit him out!

02:57.468 --> 03:03.641
If we don't win that gold star,
I'm taking you back to the pound!

03:16.613 --> 03:21.951
Oh, yes, Mama,
these carrots are delightful.

03:22.493 --> 03:26.247
Now you sit still
and be nice to these other pets.

04:10.416 --> 04:14.504
Oh, my, but the turnips
are fresh this year.

04:40.530 --> 04:42.156
Ecch. Yuck.

04:52.291 --> 04:54.085
Blecch!

06:23.341 --> 06:24.717
Thomas!

06:24.717 --> 06:26.969
What's that in your hand?

06:32.642 --> 06:34.644
You better stay right with me.

06:34.644 --> 06:35.853
We're next!

06:36.437 --> 06:40.441
Class, this is my pet cat, Thomas.

06:40.441 --> 06:42.819
He's a very special kitty.

06:59.168 --> 07:03.923
I mean to say, he's, um, very talented.

07:09.178 --> 07:11.264
What in the world are you doing?

07:38.207 --> 07:41.878
Even my mama would be impressed
by that performance.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.389
You may not be the nicest cat...

07:53.389 --> 07:58.811
...but you did win the gold star
for being the best dancer.

08:14.202 --> 08:16.412
- Ahh.
- Ahh.

09:04.919 --> 09:06.254
Look, Thomas.

09:06.254 --> 09:09.966
It's a letter from
the Society of Feline Fancifiers.

09:09.966 --> 09:13.469
You've been accepted
for their annual competition.

09:13.469 --> 09:14.971
Yes, you.

09:14.971 --> 09:18.891
If you win, you'll be a cat
of class and distinction.

09:19.517 --> 09:20.601
You better get ready.

09:20.601 --> 09:23.729
This could make
all your dreams come true.

09:33.614 --> 09:34.865
Do you think it's fair...

09:34.865 --> 09:37.159
...that such a villain's dreams
should come true?

09:39.078 --> 09:42.039
Then justice shall prevail.

09:43.165 --> 09:46.919
<i>Welcome to the 103rd annual
Society of Feline Fancifiers' Cat Show.</i>

09:48.587 --> 09:52.633
<i>I'm your host, Buster Grange,
here with the beautiful--</i>

09:52.633 --> 09:55.428
<i>Lillian Fitzpatrick Chumsworth.</i>

09:55.428 --> 09:57.263
<i>Let's go to the center ring...</i>

09:57.263 --> 10:02.018
<i>...where Tiger is finishing his run
in the agility competition.</i>

10:03.269 --> 10:06.731
<i>Oh, and he sticks his landing.</i>

10:07.481 --> 10:10.067
<i>Whoa-ho-ho! It's a double-stick landing.</i>

10:10.401 --> 10:12.987
<i>Who's the lucky dope
that gets to follow that?</i>

10:12.987 --> 10:17.283
<i>Tom, who is listed
as an Alleycatus Ignoramus.</i>

10:17.908 --> 10:20.661
<i>Whatever the breed,
he's got the speed.</i>

10:21.954 --> 10:23.497
<i>Tom clears the first hurdle.</i>

10:23.497 --> 10:24.915
<i>And the second.</i>

10:30.171 --> 10:31.797
<i>Oh, my.</i>

10:40.181 --> 10:42.433
<i>It's a multi-platform leaping trial.</i>

10:44.435 --> 10:47.271
<i>Complete with angry robotic hornets.</i>

10:56.572 --> 10:58.366
<i>Whoa, he cleared the tar pit.</i>

10:59.492 --> 11:03.120
<i>But will he survive
the mechanical alligators?</i>

11:03.120 --> 11:08.250
<i>Those aren't alligators, Buster,
they're dragons.</i>

11:10.378 --> 11:12.880
<i>Let's see how the judges
score Tom's run.</i>

11:13.381 --> 11:14.799
<i>A perfect 10.</i>

11:15.383 --> 11:17.968
<i>What a magnificent performance...</i>

11:17.968 --> 11:22.306
<i>...especially considering
the extreme difficulty of the course.</i>

11:22.306 --> 11:23.391
Sorry.

11:30.856 --> 11:36.237
<i>Let's call Tom to the center ring
for the next event, the talent competition.</i>

11:39.407 --> 11:41.784
<i>Tom will be performing a selection...</i>

11:41.784 --> 11:46.080
<i>...from my favorite clown-based opera,</i> Pagliacci.

12:08.185 --> 12:10.438
<i>It seems that Tom
has given up on opera...</i>

12:10.438 --> 12:13.357
<i>...and is now doing birdcalls.</i>

12:15.734 --> 12:18.946
<i>Oh, it's a yellow-bellied sapsucker.</i>

12:18.946 --> 12:21.240
<i>And a lily-livered thrush.</i>

12:21.240 --> 12:25.453
<i>I don't say this often, but bravissimo.</i>

12:25.453 --> 12:28.205
<i>And now, the big finish.</i>

12:28.205 --> 12:32.168
<i>Wow, a craven-spotted splatterer.</i>

12:32.168 --> 12:35.629
<i>I'm literally speechless.</i>

12:41.510 --> 12:43.304
<i>Pardonnez-moi,</i> Monsieur Pussycat.

12:43.304 --> 12:47.141
I have come all the way from Paris
to prepare you for the beauty competition.

12:48.642 --> 12:50.227
I mean no offense, monsieur...

12:50.227 --> 12:53.647
...but surely your eyebrows
must be of great concern.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.819
Not to worry, I have just the thing.

12:59.320 --> 13:02.698
Piping hot wax,
made by Parisian bees.

13:02.698 --> 13:04.408
Nothing but the best.

13:04.408 --> 13:05.618
Are you ready?

13:05.618 --> 13:09.497
On three. One, two...

13:09.497 --> 13:10.539
...three.

13:12.416 --> 13:15.336
Cosmetics to the rescue.

13:17.505 --> 13:19.965
You will be my greatest work of art.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.511
Something is missing.

13:23.511 --> 13:24.845
I know.

13:24.845 --> 13:29.183
What you need is the perfect hairdo.
<i>Magnifique!</i>

13:29.183 --> 13:32.186
<i>Calling Tom for the beauty competition.</i>

13:33.229 --> 13:36.357
<i>My, that's quite a daring appearance.</i>

13:36.899 --> 13:40.069
<i>Another 10. Unbelievable.</i>

13:40.069 --> 13:43.155
<i>This judge has really
taken a shine to Tom.</i>

13:43.155 --> 13:44.198
But why?

13:46.867 --> 13:50.496
<i>I suppose he's just lucky.</i>

13:52.998 --> 13:57.086
<i>Tom has a generous lead,
but he can't rest on his laurels yet.</i>

13:57.670 --> 14:01.423
<i>It all comes down to this.
The judge is awaiting Tom's arrival.</i>

14:01.840 --> 14:03.592
<i>As are we all.</i>

14:03.592 --> 14:06.762
<i>All contestants,
prepare for the final judging.</i>

14:13.936 --> 14:16.230
<i>Here comes Tom, and he--</i>

14:16.230 --> 14:18.440
<i>Oh. Oh, dear.</i>

14:18.440 --> 14:20.067
<i>Oh, dear me.</i>

14:32.871 --> 14:35.332
<i>The judge isn't going
to appreciate that.</i>

14:37.751 --> 14:40.004
<i>But wait, a winner
has been declared.</i>

14:42.089 --> 14:45.342
<i>It's a last-minute entry
in the micro-cat category.</i>

14:45.342 --> 14:47.970
<i>No doubt about it,
these two are the best--</i>

14:47.970 --> 14:49.471
<i>And cutest.</i>

14:49.471 --> 14:50.889
<i>kittens in the show.</i>

14:51.265 --> 14:53.767
<i>Good night, everybody.
Good night, everybody.</i>

15:09.700 --> 15:13.329
Mrs. Two Shoes,
this is a wonderful party.

15:13.329 --> 15:17.374
Yes, these finger sandwiches
are simply divine.

15:17.374 --> 15:18.542
Blecch.

15:18.542 --> 15:22.171
And such delicious cheese.

15:42.316 --> 15:43.442
Thomas!

15:43.442 --> 15:45.903
Oh, he reminds me of my Desmond.

15:45.903 --> 15:48.614
Uncivil, rambunctious, disobedient.
Oh! Aah!

15:48.614 --> 15:51.492
That was until he was tamed
by Casper Lombardo.

15:52.034 --> 15:53.160
Casper Lombardo?

15:53.661 --> 15:56.455
<i>Sí.</i> The Cat Whisperer.

15:56.455 --> 15:59.500
Now Desmond is my little angel.

16:04.338 --> 16:08.676
Hmm. Maybe
I should give the Cat Whisperer a call.

16:11.512 --> 16:15.307
Hello, I am Casper Lombardo,
the Cat Whisperer.

16:15.307 --> 16:18.602
Take me to your
very poorly behaved pussycat.

16:18.602 --> 16:20.938
He is projecting lazy energy.

16:20.938 --> 16:23.107
And he's fat.

16:23.524 --> 16:25.526
And rude. Give him a command.

16:25.526 --> 16:29.154
All right. Thomas, out of bed.

16:29.780 --> 16:32.950
Be dominant.
Show him you are the kitty leader.

16:33.325 --> 16:34.451
Tzzt-tzzt!

16:35.536 --> 16:37.788
Oh, my. What did you do?

16:37.788 --> 16:39.289
I did nothing to hurt him.

16:39.289 --> 16:43.377
You see, the sudden surprise
compels pets to obey.

16:45.212 --> 16:47.131
We will now begin to redirect...

16:47.131 --> 16:48.966
...your negative conduct.

16:48.966 --> 16:53.262
Remember that a good pet
maintains his composure with elegance.

16:54.471 --> 16:55.973
Tsk!

16:55.973 --> 16:58.142
Let's start with this book.

17:06.567 --> 17:08.777
Good. Now to increase the difficulty.

17:13.240 --> 17:15.409
Excellent. Let's add this...

17:15.409 --> 17:16.785
...and that, and this...

17:16.785 --> 17:18.620
...and that, and this.

17:18.996 --> 17:22.499
Mm. Not quite challenging enough yet.

17:23.584 --> 17:27.296
Oh, <i>sí. Perfecto.</i>

17:36.847 --> 17:38.599
You're wonderful, Casper.

17:38.599 --> 17:42.186
It's all about creating
calm leadership energy.

18:16.804 --> 18:17.721
Tsk!

18:22.142 --> 18:25.896
I will now attach your leash
to this large angry dog.

18:25.896 --> 18:28.857
This is how you will learn
peaceful pack mentality.

18:30.609 --> 18:32.569
No aggression in the pack. Tsk!

18:32.569 --> 18:37.032
You two must find a way
to create trust on this friendship walk.

18:37.491 --> 18:40.494
Remember,
trust keeps the pack strong.

19:09.314 --> 19:10.524
Tsk!

19:14.069 --> 19:17.614
Tom, every time
Mrs. Two Shoes rings this bell...

19:17.614 --> 19:20.742
...you will bring her
a delicious tray of treats...

19:20.742 --> 19:23.579
...no matter
where she is in the house.

19:33.797 --> 19:37.885
Three seconds. Good kitty.

20:17.674 --> 20:19.343
Tsk!

20:25.307 --> 20:26.892
Mrs. Two Shoes...

20:26.892 --> 20:30.062
...I can see that Thomas
is a changed cat.

20:30.062 --> 20:33.106
The Cat Whisperer
did a marvelous job.

20:33.106 --> 20:36.818
All it takes
is calm, assertive leadership.

20:59.633 --> 21:02.386
Thomas, fetch the main course.

21:04.596 --> 21:07.849
Ladies and gentlemen,
dinner is served.

21:07.849 --> 21:12.062
What is that silly cat wearing? Ha-ha-ha.

21:15.482 --> 21:16.900
I hope you like it.

21:16.900 --> 21:19.403
The man at the market
told me it was very fresh.

21:21.071 --> 21:23.907
Everyone, remain positive.

21:23.907 --> 21:27.577
He is attacking
your negative energy.

21:27.577 --> 21:30.455
Aah! Help!

21:31.123 --> 21:32.708
Get that thing away from me!

21:33.417 --> 21:36.920
Tom, get back in there
and be actively submissive.

21:39.506 --> 21:43.093
You must learn to creatively
channel your negative inclinations.

21:44.761 --> 21:47.764
Don't make me
assert my dominance.

21:48.390 --> 21:50.183
Tsk!
Aah!

21:52.352 --> 21:54.438
I will not project fear.

21:54.438 --> 21:57.232
Tsk!
Aah! Mommy!

21:57.232 --> 21:59.109
I am the pack leader!
Tsk!

21:59.109 --> 22:01.486
Creative solutions!
Tsk!

22:01.486 --> 22:03.113
I give up!
Tsk!

22:03.113 --> 22:04.698
<i>Ayúdame!</i>
