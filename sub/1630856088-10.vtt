00:18.268 --> 00:20.020
Hello.

00:21.104 --> 00:22.397
Are you all right?

00:22.397 --> 00:25.943
I can't really answer that right now.

00:25.943 --> 00:27.194
Can you walk?

00:30.781 --> 00:32.698
Yes. Thanks.

00:35.035 --> 00:38.080
Those creatures are very territorial,

00:38.080 --> 00:40.457
and we are in their territory now.

00:41.083 --> 00:42.501
All right, let's go.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.003
You're really her.

00:45.003 --> 00:47.798
You're Keiko Randa.

00:48.757 --> 00:50.717
Were you expecting someone else?

00:51.426 --> 00:54.221
I wasn't expecting to be alive.

00:56.223 --> 00:57.349
I know the feeling.

00:58.392 --> 00:59.768
We need to move.

01:00.853 --> 01:01.979
Wait.

01:04.690 --> 01:06.567
Who are you? What's your name?

01:07.734 --> 01:10.070
I'm Cate.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.488
Well, how did you get here?

01:12.906 --> 01:14.157
We fell.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.203
Oh, my God. May.

01:19.037 --> 01:20.914
We have to find the people I came with.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.082
Is Billy with you?

01:22.833 --> 01:23.834
What?

01:24.459 --> 01:25.460
Bill Randa?

01:26.795 --> 01:29.047
- Lee Shaw?
- We have to go back.

01:29.047 --> 01:32.259
- We have to find them!
- We will. Calm down.

01:33.594 --> 01:34.636
This way.

01:40.058 --> 01:41.059
Now.

03:20.075 --> 03:21.451
What were you doing?

03:21.869 --> 03:22.953
In Alaska,

03:22.953 --> 03:24.162
out in the desert...

03:24.872 --> 03:26.498
Did you know Godzilla was there?

03:27.291 --> 03:29.543
I didn't know it would be Godzilla,

03:29.543 --> 03:31.503
but I needed to draw out a Titan.

03:32.588 --> 03:33.422
Why?

03:34.423 --> 03:35.757
To open a rift.

03:36.842 --> 03:38.635
To prove the network exists.

03:43.348 --> 03:44.641
There's a gateway

03:45.517 --> 03:46.643
that leads to their world

03:47.436 --> 03:49.479
inside our own.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.107
All this to prove your theory was right?

03:54.484 --> 03:57.237
That my parents were right.

03:58.030 --> 04:01.283
If they hadn't been dismissed as
lunatics, heretics, by Monarch...

04:02.201 --> 04:03.827
maybe G-Day would never have happened.

04:09.541 --> 04:10.667
Maybe Cate

04:11.376 --> 04:12.711
would still be here.

04:16.714 --> 04:18.841
Cate's not dead because of Monarch.

04:20.636 --> 04:21.762
She's dead because of us.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.057
Because I believed in you.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.560
But all you ever cared about was this!

04:34.274 --> 04:35.108
That isn't true.

04:38.237 --> 04:39.780
I only wanted to protect you from this.

04:41.657 --> 04:44.076
But you didn't need my protection.

04:47.412 --> 04:48.914
That was my mistake.

04:56.630 --> 05:00.050
You want to spare others the pain we feel?

05:02.344 --> 05:05.639
You want to find a way for the
human species to survive?

05:08.100 --> 05:09.226
Help me.

05:09.434 --> 05:10.853
Work with me.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.354
We can solve this.

05:12.354 --> 05:13.272
Together.

05:14.439 --> 05:15.607
Solve what?

05:15.816 --> 05:17.442
The secret of co-existence.

05:23.407 --> 05:24.241
All right.

05:27.369 --> 05:28.954
If you can answer one question.

05:33.292 --> 05:34.918
That's what matters to you now?

05:36.545 --> 05:38.630
With the fate of the world at stake?

05:42.593 --> 05:44.469
The choice I made...

05:46.054 --> 05:49.266
You think I haven't tried
to understand it myself?

05:52.561 --> 05:55.898
Would you rather that I hadn't
fallen in love with your mother?

05:55.898 --> 05:58.358
That our family never existed?

05:58.358 --> 06:00.235
Our family doesn't exist.

06:02.154 --> 06:03.322
Not anymore.

06:18.795 --> 06:22.007
If the rest of
your rescue party follow my beacon,

06:22.007 --> 06:23.967
there's only one place they can come out.

06:26.678 --> 06:30.057
I knew once they find my signal
they'd come.

06:31.975 --> 06:32.976
I'm sorry.

06:33.894 --> 06:34.978
Signal?

06:35.979 --> 06:36.980
What signal?

06:41.276 --> 06:43.070
You're not part of a rescue party,
are you?

06:46.406 --> 06:47.991
You didn't expect to find me here.

06:52.788 --> 06:53.872
You're not Monarch.

06:54.706 --> 06:55.707
Who are you?

07:03.048 --> 07:04.383
Oh, my God.

07:04.383 --> 07:05.717
May.

07:07.678 --> 07:09.221
Oh, my God.

07:11.723 --> 07:13.308
Tell me who you are.

07:13.308 --> 07:14.810
Holy shit.

07:15.727 --> 07:16.854
Keiko!

07:18.564 --> 07:20.816
Keiko, is that really you?

07:20.816 --> 07:22.401
Of course it is.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.361
Who is this?

07:28.866 --> 07:30.325
It's me, Kei.

07:31.702 --> 07:32.703
It's Lee.

07:36.164 --> 07:37.165
Lee?

07:40.127 --> 07:43.505
Your voice sounds different.
Come out where I can see you.

07:45.132 --> 07:48.886
No, just stay there for a second.

07:49.845 --> 07:52.472
There's some things
you need to understand first.

07:53.557 --> 07:54.933
What things?

07:54.933 --> 07:57.644
How long do you think
you've been down here, Kei?

07:59.897 --> 08:02.482
By my estimation, 57 days.

08:03.734 --> 08:05.068
Why?

08:07.362 --> 08:08.822
Why are you hiding from me?

08:10.949 --> 08:14.536
I came down here too, Kei. After you fell.

08:15.204 --> 08:17.623
- I led a recon mission.
- Wait, you were here?

08:18.582 --> 08:21.293
How? When?

08:22.461 --> 08:24.838
That mission was in 1962.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.302
It's 1959. You're not making sense.

08:30.302 --> 08:32.679
I came down here in 1962.

08:33.347 --> 08:36.099
I thought I was here
for only a week or so,

08:36.099 --> 08:37.768
and then I was able to get right back up.

08:37.768 --> 08:39.352
I escaped, but it was--

08:40.270 --> 08:41.688
it was 1982.

08:42.813 --> 08:43.815
No.

08:46.318 --> 08:51.532
And that was thirty-three years ago.

09:02.251 --> 09:03.252
Yeah.

09:04.878 --> 09:08.465
With all the gravitational distortion...

09:10.175 --> 09:12.010
some warping of space-time would make--

09:30.529 --> 09:31.530
Is it true?

09:33.532 --> 09:36.034
Is it 2015?

09:40.622 --> 09:42.791
You always were good with numbers, Kei.

09:56.722 --> 10:01.727
- Lee.
- I can't believe you're alive. I...

10:19.536 --> 10:20.537
It's you.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.081
It is you.

10:23.957 --> 10:24.958
Lee.

10:29.671 --> 10:30.672
Billy...

10:32.674 --> 10:37.429
No, Kei. He's gone.

10:37.429 --> 10:41.099
- He died a long time ago.
- Oh, no.

10:43.769 --> 10:46.897
No. No, no, no, no.

11:05.832 --> 11:06.917
Hiroshi?

11:07.668 --> 11:09.002
Hiroshi?

11:11.588 --> 11:12.589
He's fine.

11:15.133 --> 11:17.261
He's fine. He's okay.

11:17.886 --> 11:22.349
How do you know?

11:22.349 --> 11:23.684
Who are you?

11:28.522 --> 11:30.065
I'm your granddaughter.

11:51.837 --> 11:53.172
How's the leg?

11:53.172 --> 11:55.591
It's good. Only hurts when I walk on it.

11:55.591 --> 11:57.134
Get your ass in a seat then.

11:57.134 --> 11:59.761
The gamma emissions
seemed to have stabilized.

11:59.761 --> 12:01.972
Still high, but not end-of-the-world high.

12:01.972 --> 12:04.099
We called in every warm body we could.

12:04.933 --> 12:07.060
Most of the outposts are back online...

12:07.811 --> 12:08.812
barely.

12:11.565 --> 12:12.816
Any word from Duvall?

12:14.234 --> 12:15.611
Were you expecting one?

12:17.279 --> 12:18.280
Not really.

12:22.159 --> 12:23.243
What about the signal?

12:23.243 --> 12:26.663
- It is not our priority right now.
- Someone could be alive

12:26.663 --> 12:28.040
and that is not a priority?

12:28.040 --> 12:31.251
With the whole planet still humming
like a pressure cooker?

12:31.251 --> 12:35.214
With every station on alert
for a possible emergence? No, it's not.

12:35.214 --> 12:38.675
If someone survived down there,
they might know what's going on.

12:38.675 --> 12:42.930
- That feels like it might be a big deal.
- In normal times it would be a huge deal,

12:42.930 --> 12:45.265
but we are looking at
a wave of Titan events

12:45.265 --> 12:48.101
threatening the lives
of seven billion people.

12:49.186 --> 12:51.647
I'm not peeling off resources
to save three.

12:51.647 --> 12:53.857
Okay. What if the three
could save the seven billion?

12:57.402 --> 12:58.695
Someone is alive down there.

12:59.988 --> 13:03.200
And they might have the answers we need,
and they are calling us for help.

13:03.200 --> 13:06.078
We cannot pretend that we don't hear 'em!

13:09.039 --> 13:11.166
Look at the map, Tim.

13:12.793 --> 13:15.629
Look at the scale of
what we are trying to stop.

13:16.630 --> 13:18.090
My hands are tied.

13:19.383 --> 13:20.843
Then untie them!

13:23.178 --> 13:25.097
Otherwise Shaw was right about us.

13:28.350 --> 13:29.810
He was definitely right about you.

13:33.313 --> 13:36.483
I need you to think very carefully
about the next words you're gonna say.

13:40.696 --> 13:44.283
Now, are you going to take your seat,

13:45.450 --> 13:46.660
do your job,

13:46.660 --> 13:48.370
and help us deal with this crisis?

13:53.250 --> 13:55.836
Or do I need to
extend your medical leave indefinitely?

14:23.697 --> 14:25.282
Oh, my God.

14:26.074 --> 14:28.327
Unbelievable.

14:31.580 --> 14:35.083
I reconfigured the emitter tube
to send out a directional gamma ray pulse

14:35.083 --> 14:36.627
to let you know where I was.

14:40.172 --> 14:42.799
So Monarch made it to 1962.

14:42.799 --> 14:44.510
They're around even today.

14:47.304 --> 14:48.889
Dad was part of it.

14:57.940 --> 14:59.191
Tell me about him.

15:02.736 --> 15:06.865
He's a family man.

15:07.741 --> 15:09.368
He followed in your footsteps.

15:10.827 --> 15:15.624
And when Monarch wouldn't let him,
he did it on his own.

15:17.167 --> 15:22.714
He never knew-- knows when to stop.

15:30.389 --> 15:31.390
Is he happy?

15:33.976 --> 15:35.894
Why don't you ask him that yourself?

15:39.147 --> 15:44.111
Can you rewire this back
to its original configuration?

15:46.572 --> 15:48.615
Yes. I think so.

15:51.410 --> 15:54.037
Well, in that case,

15:55.664 --> 15:56.874
I'm gonna take you home.

16:07.718 --> 16:09.636
I told you it wouldn't take long.

16:13.223 --> 16:16.101
I gave most everything away.

16:19.605 --> 16:21.648
I still need to make a few more trips.

16:23.734 --> 16:25.110
Where will you go?

16:28.322 --> 16:29.573
San Francisco.

16:31.783 --> 16:33.952
Just for a few days.

16:34.953 --> 16:37.789
There are some things I need to do...

16:37.789 --> 16:39.374
for the divorce.

16:45.255 --> 16:46.298
Emiko,

16:46.298 --> 16:48.800
from now on...

16:52.763 --> 16:55.641
After the attack on San Francisco,

16:55.641 --> 16:57.935
we called everyone we could think of.

16:57.935 --> 17:00.521
Hospitals. The Red Cross.

17:00.521 --> 17:02.814
We searched the internet.

17:02.814 --> 17:06.401
I never gave up hope that
you would come home.

17:15.868 --> 17:18.121
We dreamed about this day.

17:27.256 --> 17:30.342
No matter what you did to me,

17:30.342 --> 17:34.596
your son deserves a
relationship with his father.

17:44.106 --> 17:45.816
So please,

17:47.401 --> 17:49.361
when you find out where you'll be staying,

17:50.529 --> 17:52.281
let Kentaro know.

18:17.681 --> 18:19.057
You're good. Just keep going.

18:19.057 --> 18:21.018
- Can we go around?
- This is the only way.

18:21.018 --> 18:23.228
- May, don't get hooked up on the tree.
- Steady.

18:23.228 --> 18:25.189
- Look out. Oh, damn it.
- Got it.

18:26.356 --> 18:27.608
Yeah. Let's take five.

18:27.608 --> 18:28.942
We've got all the time in the world.

18:28.942 --> 18:30.819
- Yeah.
- I don't know about you guys,

18:30.819 --> 18:34.781
but I'd like to get back to a world
with flying cars and robot butlers.

18:34.781 --> 18:37.534
Yeah. And maybe nursing homes on the moon.

18:37.534 --> 18:40.412
Okay. I think we can all use a breather.

18:40.412 --> 18:41.496
Works for me.

18:43.665 --> 18:45.042
Hold on, Keiko.

18:47.336 --> 18:48.795
Hey, seriously...

18:49.546 --> 18:50.797
- don't go far.
- Don't go far.

18:51.965 --> 18:54.301
- All right. You ready?
- Yeah.

18:54.301 --> 18:55.761
Two, three...

19:35.551 --> 19:36.718
You mind if I join you?

19:38.428 --> 19:40.639
What are you doing here?

19:40.639 --> 19:42.432
Your mother said I might find you here.

19:59.616 --> 20:00.993
How's your leg?

20:00.993 --> 20:02.911
It hurts when it rains.

20:02.911 --> 20:03.996
Yours?

20:05.747 --> 20:07.332
Makes a funny clicking sound.

20:11.879 --> 20:12.921
<i>Kanpai.</i>

20:20.429 --> 20:21.430
Wow.

20:22.848 --> 20:24.892
I'm not usually a big whiskey guy--

20:24.892 --> 20:26.476
What are you doing here?

20:35.611 --> 20:39.323
The gamma ray bursts,
we found a coherent signal.

20:41.658 --> 20:42.659
A signal?

20:44.119 --> 20:45.996
- A message.
- From who?

20:45.996 --> 20:47.414
I don't know,

20:48.957 --> 20:52.586
but it's coming from inside the rifts.

20:52.586 --> 20:56.423
What am I supposed to do with it?
I don't know what any of this means.

20:56.423 --> 20:57.508
No, you don't...

21:00.469 --> 21:01.595
but your father might.

21:16.235 --> 21:17.152
Thank you.

21:25.327 --> 21:26.703
Kei, I gotta tell you...

21:28.413 --> 21:33.710
you look exactly as you've always looked
in my mind's eye.

21:33.710 --> 21:34.795
All these years.

21:35.379 --> 21:36.380
Exactly.

21:46.598 --> 21:48.851
I've been talking to you and Billy
in my head

21:48.851 --> 21:50.519
the whole time I was here.

21:50.519 --> 21:51.603
Yeah.

21:54.398 --> 21:55.774
Who you were anyway.

22:11.582 --> 22:13.125
What happened to Billy?

22:14.793 --> 22:16.044
I heard that--

22:18.380 --> 22:21.884
I guess he was leading
an expedition to some island and...

22:21.884 --> 22:25.596
was trying to prove some of
the theories about all this

22:27.097 --> 22:28.098
and...

22:29.516 --> 22:31.393
he never came back.

22:35.814 --> 22:37.608
But he did it, Kei.

22:37.608 --> 22:39.776
He was the last man standing.

22:39.776 --> 22:41.820
I mean, he went down swinging.

22:41.820 --> 22:43.405
He saved Monarch.

22:44.114 --> 22:48.118
He saved everything you and he built.

22:49.369 --> 22:51.538
Everything the three of us built.

22:55.459 --> 22:56.668
Yeah.

22:58.754 --> 22:59.796
Yeah.

23:06.303 --> 23:09.014
I've lost so much time, Lee.

23:21.735 --> 23:23.237
What's it like now?

23:25.656 --> 23:27.407
2015.

23:27.407 --> 23:30.077
Even the words sound fantastic.

23:33.205 --> 23:36.667
Yeah, cars are smaller and more efficient,
nowhere near as cool.

23:36.667 --> 23:40.712
But the, you know, TV sets are bigger,
flat. Everybody's got one.

23:40.712 --> 23:42.130
I mean, they're everywhere.

23:42.631 --> 23:44.633
And, you know, gadgets.

23:44.633 --> 23:47.469
You know, they got a phone
that does everything and it's--

23:47.970 --> 23:49.596
Oh, hey, we went to the moon.

23:50.764 --> 23:51.807
Yeah.

23:52.724 --> 23:56.979
Of course, I missed
that one too because I was down here.

23:59.481 --> 24:01.316
But, you know, it's...

24:03.986 --> 24:06.530
Same old world.

24:08.740 --> 24:10.909
Same people...

24:13.745 --> 24:16.665
conflicts, triumphs.

24:18.458 --> 24:22.754
You know, moms, dads...

24:25.299 --> 24:26.425
kids.

24:42.149 --> 24:45.444
Well, speaking of kids,
I guess I should check in on ours.

24:57.956 --> 25:00.584
<i>I don't know if this will get to you.
I hope so.</i>

25:00.584 --> 25:03.420
<i>Actually, I don't,
because it will probably mean I'm dead,</i>

25:03.921 --> 25:05.756
<i>which you may not feel
too busted up about.</i>

25:07.341 --> 25:08.634
<i>Sorry, I gotta keep this short.</i>

25:08.634 --> 25:10.677
<i>You may never forgive me
for what I took from you,</i>

25:10.677 --> 25:13.805
<i>and I can't go back in time and fix
all the mistakes that I made.</i>

25:15.140 --> 25:17.434
<i>But maybe I could leave something
for the future.</i>

25:17.935 --> 25:19.478
<i>A legacy.</i>

25:19.478 --> 25:22.272
<i>And you'll realize it was all worth it.</i>

25:32.115 --> 25:33.492
Hello, Hiroshi.

25:34.076 --> 25:35.244
Tim.

25:35.244 --> 25:36.495
What are you doing here?

25:37.746 --> 25:38.789
May we come in?

25:42.459 --> 25:43.961
I thought you wanted my help?

25:53.762 --> 25:54.763
Your father.

25:55.597 --> 26:00.018
I always appreciated your fidelity
to my parents' memory, Tim, but...

26:01.270 --> 26:02.729
I'm very busy.

26:04.064 --> 26:07.276
And I have no interest
in working with Monarch.

26:07.276 --> 26:09.027
Well, that's probably good

26:09.027 --> 26:11.738
because they wouldn't touch you
with a ten-foot pole.

26:12.239 --> 26:13.824
Then what do you want?

26:13.824 --> 26:15.284
Just show him.

26:21.415 --> 26:24.418
Gamma ray bursts
coming from inside the rifts.

26:25.169 --> 26:27.504
I'm well aware of gamma emissions.

26:27.504 --> 26:28.797
No. Not these.

26:29.464 --> 26:31.675
They're not the same
as the ones we detected before G-Day.

26:31.675 --> 26:33.969
There is a coherent signal in there.

26:35.596 --> 26:36.763
Coherent?

26:37.264 --> 26:38.473
How? By what?

26:39.600 --> 26:40.684
By who.

26:41.185 --> 26:42.477
He thinks Cate could be alive.

26:48.859 --> 26:50.319
Why are you doing this?

26:50.319 --> 26:52.362
Look, it sounds crazy, I know.

26:52.362 --> 26:55.157
- It's impossible.
- It's not impossible. Shaw came back.

26:55.157 --> 26:56.575
And the rest of the team didn't.

26:58.160 --> 27:00.245
The variables are nearly infinite.

27:01.413 --> 27:03.123
You sound like you don't
want it to be true.

27:03.415 --> 27:05.042
Of course I want it to be true!

27:05.501 --> 27:08.170
But there's a big difference between
what you want to be and what could be.

27:12.132 --> 27:13.175
This is cruel.

27:14.134 --> 27:16.094
You said you wanted me to work with you.

27:16.094 --> 27:17.930
To finish your journey.

27:17.930 --> 27:19.264
Fine. I'm in.

27:20.098 --> 27:22.184
But first, help me find my sister.

27:29.858 --> 27:32.819
How? Monarch won't help.

27:33.654 --> 27:35.489
Not with something like this.

27:35.489 --> 27:37.032
No, they won't.

27:37.032 --> 27:38.784
And that's why I quit.

27:41.203 --> 27:43.205
Monarch isn't the only game in town.

27:44.998 --> 27:47.960
<i>So if we're in
the realm of the Titans or whatever,</i>

27:47.960 --> 27:50.003
why does it look so much like Earth?

27:50.003 --> 27:52.214
Because it is. Parts of it, anyway.

27:52.214 --> 27:54.132
Different pieces of home.

27:54.132 --> 27:56.385
Different pieces of their world.

27:56.385 --> 27:58.846
All put together like a patchwork quilt.

27:58.846 --> 28:01.765
I don't think
this is the realm of the Titans at all.

28:01.765 --> 28:03.600
It's a place between places.

28:03.600 --> 28:06.562
I call it "Axis Mundi."

28:08.021 --> 28:09.565
The pole between heaven and earth.

28:09.565 --> 28:10.649
You know.

28:11.525 --> 28:12.901
Schoolteacher.

28:12.901 --> 28:14.862
Look, there it goes again.

28:14.862 --> 28:16.572
Let's put it down.

28:22.244 --> 28:26.039
How is light getting in
when we're underground?

28:26.790 --> 28:28.876
How do you know we are underground?

28:29.376 --> 28:30.878
'Cause we fell down a hole.

28:30.878 --> 28:32.921
- Did we fall?
- Yeah.

28:33.839 --> 28:35.382
Or did we enter?

28:36.592 --> 28:38.051
The rabbit hole.

28:39.553 --> 28:41.138
Welcome to it, Alice.

28:42.723 --> 28:44.057
We're almost there.

28:44.057 --> 28:45.267
Let's keep moving.

28:47.644 --> 28:49.605
- Okay. Ready?
- All right.

28:49.605 --> 28:50.814
Yeah.

28:51.315 --> 28:53.317
Two, three. Up.

28:56.737 --> 28:57.738
Okay.

29:29.436 --> 29:30.729
Well, there she is.

29:31.939 --> 29:33.524
Right where I left her.

29:35.526 --> 29:37.069
What is that?

29:37.069 --> 29:39.404
That is our ride.

29:40.030 --> 29:41.198
Come on, let's go.

30:14.773 --> 30:16.316
Gotta be kidding me.

30:17.442 --> 30:20.112
It's amazing. This is amazing, isn't it?

30:20.737 --> 30:21.572
It is.

30:21.572 --> 30:23.991
Fifty-three years
and it's still got juice.

30:24.950 --> 30:26.410
It's only been here a few weeks.

30:27.202 --> 30:29.413
Thank you for reminding me, Dr. Randa.

30:32.416 --> 30:35.627
All right, let's get these things wired up
and get the hell out of here.

30:36.628 --> 30:38.213
- Give it a little slack, May.
- Okay.

30:38.213 --> 30:39.798
- And now, Kei...
- Yep.

30:39.798 --> 30:42.718
...make sure you put the black line up top.

30:43.260 --> 30:44.344
It allows us to control it...

30:44.344 --> 30:45.512
- I got it.
- ...from inside the pod.

30:45.512 --> 30:46.847
What?

30:46.847 --> 30:47.848
That sounded close.

30:48.640 --> 30:50.726
All right. Everybody in the pod. Let's go.

30:52.060 --> 30:54.229
- Kei. I got it.
- Do not rush me.

30:54.229 --> 30:55.606
I got it. I know how to finish it.

30:55.606 --> 30:57.274
- I've got this.
- Kei. Stop.

30:57.274 --> 30:59.818
- Kei, what is wrong with you?
- I'm staying behind.

31:01.570 --> 31:02.571
What?

31:06.074 --> 31:07.159
Billy's gone.

31:10.037 --> 31:12.080
And my boy grew up without me.

31:13.123 --> 31:18.587
I am not going to ruin his life
again by reappearing suddenly.

31:22.549 --> 31:23.675
Whatever's out there...

31:26.470 --> 31:27.804
it's not my world.

31:29.431 --> 31:30.641
Not anymore.

31:32.226 --> 31:33.393
No.

31:36.563 --> 31:40.651
These monsters
have taken everything from me.

31:42.569 --> 31:44.071
No more.

31:46.073 --> 31:48.742
This curse is broken.

31:52.871 --> 31:54.915
You still have work to do up there.

32:03.715 --> 32:04.925
And we need you.

32:23.193 --> 32:25.279
Now let's move our asses
and get out of here.

32:27.239 --> 32:28.657
She's your granddaughter.

32:28.657 --> 32:30.242
Funny.

32:34.580 --> 32:37.124
All right, if everyone will
fasten their seat belts,

32:37.124 --> 32:39.001
we're first in line for takeoff.

32:40.169 --> 32:42.379
I'm assuming this flight
doesn't have drink service.

32:42.379 --> 32:46.049
Nope. But when we get back,
first round's on me. Yeah?

32:47.050 --> 32:49.970
- Ready?
- Just waiting for you.

32:50.846 --> 32:52.764
Kinda seems like old times, huh?

32:52.764 --> 32:54.266
Speak for yourself.

32:56.268 --> 32:57.477
All right.

32:58.228 --> 32:59.479
Let's go home.

33:07.154 --> 33:08.113
Hey, copilot.

33:08.113 --> 33:11.408
- See that radar scope in front of you?
- Yeah.

33:11.408 --> 33:13.952
When that thing starts blipping,
it means the device has lured a Titan

33:13.952 --> 33:16.330
that will open the rift
and that's our way home.

33:16.330 --> 33:17.456
But how do we take off?

33:17.456 --> 33:20.459
Just hang on.
I think you'll know it when you feel it.

33:20.459 --> 33:22.252
Just holler when it hits 3,000 feet.

33:22.252 --> 33:25.088
I'll shut the device off.
The Titan's retreat will pull us in.

33:34.598 --> 33:36.892
Lee, what is it? What do you see?

33:37.392 --> 33:38.393
Shit.

33:38.393 --> 33:40.354
We lured a Titan that was already here.

33:47.194 --> 33:48.529
Brace!

33:54.368 --> 33:56.828
There's something coming
through the rift. 7,000 feet.

33:59.206 --> 34:00.457
5,000 feet.

34:02.626 --> 34:05.546
- Come on!
- 4,000.

34:05.546 --> 34:06.922
Shaw! What do we do?

34:06.922 --> 34:09.675
We're running out of time
and we're not gonna get another shot.

34:09.675 --> 34:10.759
Oh, my God.

34:24.313 --> 34:26.775
It's leaving. It's going away from us.

34:26.775 --> 34:27.693
Shit.

34:28.902 --> 34:30.612
- Wait, what are you doing?
- My job.

34:30.612 --> 34:33.239
- What are you doing? No! Stop!
- Get back here!

34:35.324 --> 34:36.994
Stop! Lee!

34:38.120 --> 34:40.330
No! What are you doing?

35:06.440 --> 35:08.734
Oh, can't anything ever be easy?

35:08.734 --> 35:10.360
Lee, get back here!

35:15.073 --> 35:16.950
No, no, no, no, no. We're losing it.

35:25.459 --> 35:26.293
Lee!

35:56.156 --> 35:57.574
- Lee!
- No!

37:06.977 --> 37:07.978
Lee!

37:25.204 --> 37:26.496
Lee!

37:27.206 --> 37:30.417
Lee! Run! Lee!

37:33.795 --> 37:35.797
Lee, hold my hand!

37:37.174 --> 37:39.218
I got you! Don't let go!

37:43.514 --> 37:44.848
- No!
- Come back!

37:44.848 --> 37:47.184
- Lee, no! I got you!
- It's too much weight, Kei!

37:49.102 --> 37:51.480
- It's all right, Kei.
- No, I'm not letting go!

37:51.480 --> 37:52.439
Thank you...

37:53.190 --> 37:55.359
- No.
- ...for everything.

37:55.359 --> 37:56.818
Don't let...

37:57.319 --> 37:59.863
No! Lee!

38:07.454 --> 38:08.872
Lee!

38:09.748 --> 38:12.417
No!

38:12.417 --> 38:14.127
Kei, look at me. Strap in!

39:25.115 --> 39:26.825
Where are we?

39:33.832 --> 39:35.667
What is this place?

39:37.127 --> 39:38.253
Who are you?

39:45.844 --> 39:46.929
Cate!

39:49.848 --> 39:50.891
Cate.

39:55.938 --> 39:56.939
Welcome back.

40:08.450 --> 40:10.577
- You did all this?
- Me? No.

40:10.577 --> 40:12.454
I don't understand most of it.

40:12.454 --> 40:15.082
But we were lucky someone
had already done a lot of the math.

40:20.379 --> 40:21.547
Dad.

40:59.918 --> 41:01.086
Mama?

41:13.932 --> 41:15.142
You got so big.

41:31.950 --> 41:33.452
I'm so sorry.

41:36.163 --> 41:37.581
I'm so sorry.

42:01.396 --> 42:02.481
Kentaro,

42:03.899 --> 42:07.778
I'd like you to meet our grandmother.

42:11.657 --> 42:14.409
This is my brother.

42:22.918 --> 42:26.964
I hate to interrupt, but we'd like
to get you into medical and debriefing.

42:27.548 --> 42:29.132
It's this way.

42:29.132 --> 42:32.761
Brenda, what are you doing here?

42:33.387 --> 42:35.389
Well, someone had to pay for all of this.

42:39.768 --> 42:41.436
Are you working with her now?

42:43.021 --> 42:44.273
It's complicated.

42:46.859 --> 42:49.027
A lot's changed in the past two years.

42:52.197 --> 42:53.574
Two years?

42:57.661 --> 42:58.704
Shall we go?

42:59.204 --> 43:01.164
Come on. Let's go. Go.

43:01.164 --> 43:02.791
What the hell is going on?

43:02.791 --> 43:05.460
Only everything I ever promised you.

43:15.387 --> 43:16.930
Come on.
