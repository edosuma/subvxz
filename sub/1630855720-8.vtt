00:27.611 --> 00:29.655
By the way, you should be proud.

00:30.155 --> 00:32.658
You already made two
of those wishes come true.

00:32.658 --> 00:35.160
And I know she ain't wanna tell you
what they were.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.079
Bad luck. But fuck it.

00:38.997 --> 00:42.167
Three wishes,
before these three knots are tied.

00:48.423 --> 00:49.424
A good husband.

00:52.803 --> 00:54.054
How are you two doing?

00:59.977 --> 01:00.978
A healthy child.

01:01.562 --> 01:02.604
Hey.

01:03.814 --> 01:04.815
Oh, my God.

01:07.860 --> 01:14.074
But Emma's third wish, it's the only one
that hasn't come true yet.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.120
God, forgive me.

01:21.832 --> 01:23.000
How did I lose her?

01:23.000 --> 01:24.668
It's not a baby.

01:25.502 --> 01:26.503
What happened?

01:27.129 --> 01:29.923
Hey, I'm William. William Wheeler.

01:30.424 --> 01:32.885
<i>Yeah, I read about your wife
giving birth on the A train.</i>

01:33.385 --> 01:35.596
I found you
through all your social media accounts.

01:38.265 --> 01:40.100
<i>All those pictures you posted.</i>

01:40.100 --> 01:41.852
Early mornings in the park.

01:45.189 --> 01:46.607
- You're a coder?
- Yeah.

01:47.191 --> 01:49.109
<i>You know, a hundred people with
a hundred computers,</i>

01:49.109 --> 01:50.527
<i>they'll work day and night.</i>

01:50.527 --> 01:51.695
<i>They won't quit.</i>

01:51.695 --> 01:53.864
Can you look? It's gone. It's not here.

01:54.448 --> 01:57.326
Who's Kinder Garten?
Why would this guy make this?

01:58.285 --> 01:59.995
I just wanted to see the baby.

02:03.332 --> 02:04.458
"Got him."

02:05.459 --> 02:06.668
<i>That's what the text said.</i>

02:07.252 --> 02:10.297
<i>None of the women have ever found
their children.</i>

02:10.297 --> 02:11.798
You should go to Brian's grave.

02:14.134 --> 02:18.722
William Webster Wheeler.
Owns a house in Forest Hills.

02:18.722 --> 02:22.601
That area in Queens
used to be called Little Norway.

02:23.936 --> 02:27.189
<i>There's a nude photo of your wife
in an art gallery in Norway.</i>

02:28.982 --> 02:30.776
<i>Well, my family's Norwegian.</i>

02:31.276 --> 02:33.028
You know,
sailing's just kind of in our blood.

02:33.904 --> 02:36.573
<i>Once upon a time, a specific time,</i>

02:37.449 --> 02:40.244
<i>July 5th, 1825, to be exact,</i>

02:41.245 --> 02:43.789
<i>52 men and women sailed out of Norway</i>

02:43.789 --> 02:46.875
<i>in an undersized sloop
they named</i> Restauration<i>.</i>

02:49.253 --> 02:52.464
<i>These immigrants sought
religious freedom from persecution,</i>

02:52.464 --> 02:54.216
<i>so they fled to America.</i>

02:56.510 --> 02:58.637
<i>Not just an improbable crossing.</i>

02:59.555 --> 03:01.265
<i>An impossible one.</i>

03:04.726 --> 03:06.687
<i>How in the world did they make it?</i>

03:12.442 --> 03:14.278
<i>They had help. That's how.</i>

04:30.687 --> 04:34.358
<i>And when my friends saw
my authentic identity,</i>

04:35.150 --> 04:37.319
they gave me my true name.

04:38.028 --> 04:41.907
In fact, Apollo, you know it already.

04:44.368 --> 04:45.369
How do I know?

04:46.620 --> 04:48.288
Dinner plans tonight,

04:49.623 --> 04:53.669
a meal inspired by baby Brian,

04:54.253 --> 04:56.547
boiled vegetables.

04:58.006 --> 04:59.424
You're Kinder Garten.

04:59.424 --> 05:03.345
We. We are Kinder Garten.

05:05.097 --> 05:08.350
10,000 men with one name.

05:08.934 --> 05:10.978
You-- You killed your daughter.

05:10.978 --> 05:13.605
I made a choice for my family.

05:14.189 --> 05:16.108
I made the hardest choice there is.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.611
No. No. What did you do?

05:26.285 --> 05:27.828
I called in the cavalry.

05:28.453 --> 05:29.621
Someone's coming.

05:30.122 --> 05:31.456
Did you do what I asked?

05:31.456 --> 05:34.668
Do I get my Gretta back? My Grace?

05:35.627 --> 05:37.963
- Where is my family?
- Someone's coming.

05:37.963 --> 05:39.798
You were supposed to bring them to me.

05:39.798 --> 05:41.091
Someone's coming!

05:43.677 --> 05:46.138
I asked you for a simple favor, Apollo.

05:48.056 --> 05:50.684
This is on your head, not mine.

05:51.518 --> 05:55.105
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

05:56.315 --> 06:00.068
Once upon a time,
a man and a lady wanted to have a baby.

06:00.903 --> 06:02.988
You are in trouble now.

06:02.988 --> 06:04.656
I curse you.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.371
Fuck.

06:20.756 --> 06:23.967
Cal, he's not who we think he is!

06:37.439 --> 06:40.192
No. No. No.

06:47.699 --> 06:48.867
No, no.

06:53.372 --> 06:55.165
Where are you? Where are--

06:58.794 --> 06:59.837
Where are you?

07:01.547 --> 07:04.091
No, no, no. No.

07:07.344 --> 07:08.345
Cal!

07:11.098 --> 07:12.099
Gayl!

07:15.435 --> 07:16.436
Gayl.

07:34.538 --> 07:36.331
Do you mind if I read with you?

07:44.214 --> 07:45.215
Gretta.

07:48.010 --> 07:50.554
"The music is playing,
the dancers move quick.

07:50.554 --> 07:53.557
A child in their arms
will never grow sick."

08:20.000 --> 08:21.251
I killed her.

08:24.338 --> 08:26.757
Gretta wouldn't be dead
if I hadn't brought her back.

08:27.508 --> 08:29.384
She was helping get the children out.

08:31.678 --> 08:32.679
Cal.

08:32.679 --> 08:33.764
Cal!

08:58.705 --> 09:00.999
- Do we have everyone?
- Everyone that survived.

09:00.999 --> 09:03.544
- You okay? You good?
- You're right. Go with her.

09:03.544 --> 09:06.296
- I am not a bad man!
- Motherfuck--

09:06.797 --> 09:10.175
- No, I know it--
- Stop. We cannot risk it.

09:10.175 --> 09:14.888
- Just let me explain myself!
- We have to get off this island.

09:15.389 --> 09:17.391
Oh, pretty please.

09:18.642 --> 09:19.643
You guys all right?

09:19.643 --> 09:21.061
- Yeah, let's go. Take her hand.
- Okay.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.855
Don't you want to play?

09:23.730 --> 09:25.399
Then run, little piggy.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.234
Run away.

09:28.360 --> 09:29.361
Run!

09:59.850 --> 10:01.018
Okay. Okay.

10:09.651 --> 10:11.361
I want you to hold your breath.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.462
It's all right.
It's all right. It's all right.

10:47.272 --> 10:48.357
Come on.

10:50.943 --> 10:53.904
Okay. All right. Now, quietly go.

11:31.692 --> 11:34.027
No way. No fucking way.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.446
This is stupid, Cal.
You want us to all go down there?

11:36.446 --> 11:38.031
There's no way back.

11:49.918 --> 11:51.753
Are you guys ready? All set?

12:07.102 --> 12:09.855
Hey. Hey. I'll take her. Okay?

12:09.855 --> 12:11.857
- I can't lose another one.
- I know.

12:11.857 --> 12:13.984
- I can't.
- I know you can't, and you won't.

12:13.984 --> 12:15.861
Okay? Just trust me.

12:21.909 --> 12:23.827
Hurry, we don't have much time.

12:23.827 --> 12:26.413
I'm coming!

12:31.251 --> 12:33.504
- Where are you?
- All right.

12:33.504 --> 12:35.589
Then you're gonna wrap your legs around.

12:35.589 --> 12:37.758
- All right? You ready for an adventure?
- No.

12:39.134 --> 12:42.471
There we go. All right, we're good.
We're going down. Okay, you're ready?

12:45.140 --> 12:46.350
Good, hold tight.

12:46.350 --> 12:47.434
Shit.

12:48.977 --> 12:52.648
All right. Make sure you're holding it
tight, tight, tight. Okay.

12:54.149 --> 12:58.654
Hold on to me. Good, good.
There we go. Keep holding. Keep holding.

13:08.914 --> 13:10.791
You're doing really good. Okay.

13:12.668 --> 13:14.336
Come on. Keep going.

13:14.336 --> 13:16.046
It's right here. You're almost there.

13:16.755 --> 13:17.840
It's coming back.

13:25.264 --> 13:27.474
- Mommy! No!
- I got you. I got you.

13:30.435 --> 13:31.436
Cal!

13:32.271 --> 13:34.064
Go! Go!

13:34.648 --> 13:37.401
- Okay. Down we go.
- Keep moving down. Keep going!

13:43.031 --> 13:44.825
Get to the bottom! Go!

13:50.664 --> 13:52.124
Apollo!

13:52.124 --> 13:53.208
Hey!

13:53.750 --> 13:55.127
You! Move!

13:55.127 --> 13:57.045
You guys have to catch her, okay?

13:58.213 --> 14:00.215
Now, what I need you to do
is trust me, okay?

14:00.215 --> 14:01.925
Close your eyes and trust me.

14:02.426 --> 14:04.219
You can fly. You're a superhero!

14:17.649 --> 14:18.483
I got you.

14:41.048 --> 14:44.676
Emma.

14:53.727 --> 14:56.396
Wake up. Wake up.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.065
It's time to wake up now.

14:59.775 --> 15:00.776
It's okay.

15:03.820 --> 15:06.114
Wake up. Wake up.

15:07.199 --> 15:08.825
You can do it.

15:09.409 --> 15:10.786
You're a superhero.

15:11.787 --> 15:15.040
You don't see. But you will.

15:15.749 --> 15:16.750
God.

15:27.135 --> 15:30.556
Emma. Shit.

15:40.858 --> 15:42.359
I told you we had a navy.

15:43.402 --> 15:45.237
Hurry. We don't have much time.

15:52.369 --> 15:54.413
He's gone back
to finish off the buildings.

15:54.413 --> 15:56.623
He thinks we're trapped by the water.
Let's go.

15:58.333 --> 15:59.543
I said let's go!

16:02.629 --> 16:03.922
Hurry, get on board.

16:09.887 --> 16:12.347
Okay. Let's go. You save me
a seat in there, all right?

16:12.973 --> 16:14.766
You need help? There you go.

16:16.894 --> 16:17.895
Shit.

16:18.979 --> 16:20.772
Thank you, Apollo.

16:22.107 --> 16:23.317
You're a good man.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.830
- Cal, we gotta go, now.
- Apollo,

16:38.582 --> 16:40.501
- you're not taking this trip.
- What?

16:40.501 --> 16:43.629
I'm gonna help you get on the creek boat.
Just trust me.

16:46.840 --> 16:49.426
Go now. Don't look back.

17:01.688 --> 17:02.856
Thank you, Cal.

17:17.454 --> 17:21.333
- Cal, why didn't you get on the boat?
- We gotta keep 'em busy,

17:21.875 --> 17:23.627
let the trawler get some distance.

17:23.627 --> 17:25.045
But they're already on the water.

17:26.463 --> 17:27.964
The big one can swim.

17:31.176 --> 17:32.594
People call us witches.

17:33.804 --> 17:37.224
Maybe what they really mean is we're women
who did things that seemed impossible.

17:37.975 --> 17:41.520
When you have to save the one you love,
you become something else.

17:42.020 --> 17:43.188
You will transform.

17:44.439 --> 17:46.316
You know, the only real magic, Apollo,

17:46.316 --> 17:49.152
is in the things you'll do
for the ones you love.

17:51.363 --> 17:53.156
You know, the last time I saw Emma,

17:53.156 --> 17:56.910
she was paddling out
across the river to find your son.

17:57.619 --> 17:59.913
And I tell you,
out on that water, that woman,

18:01.540 --> 18:02.374
she glowed.

18:05.460 --> 18:07.004
Mama's coming for you.

18:09.798 --> 18:11.216
Let's get you out of here.

18:13.552 --> 18:15.929
- Come on. Get in.
- Do you know the myth of Callisto?

18:15.929 --> 18:18.515
Yeah, it's-- Zeus turns

18:18.515 --> 18:22.102
her and her son into constellations,
Ursa Major, Ursa Minor.

18:24.229 --> 18:27.316
It's about as happy an ending
as those Greek stories ever get.

18:29.401 --> 18:33.447
Callisto gets to spend eternity
up there with her child.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.200
She can always see him.

18:36.200 --> 18:39.161
She always knows he's safe
under her watchful gaze.

18:42.873 --> 18:46.835
I'm tired,
and I wanna see my little boy again.

18:47.586 --> 18:49.421
- What?
- And you,

18:50.255 --> 18:53.634
Apollo, you must find your wife,
so you'll finally believe.

18:53.634 --> 18:56.011
Yeah. Okay. But how am I gonna find her?

18:56.512 --> 18:59.223
"Brian is in the forest."
That's what she said.

18:59.223 --> 19:01.850
There's only one forest in all
of New York City.

19:02.684 --> 19:03.727
Apollo!

19:05.020 --> 19:06.104
Could that be you?

19:07.481 --> 19:11.568
Don't tell me the bitches left you behind.

19:12.444 --> 19:14.905
There, there!

19:28.085 --> 19:30.587
Again. Again.

19:38.011 --> 19:39.263
Go, Apollo.

19:40.264 --> 19:42.349
Cal, what are you gonna do?

19:42.891 --> 19:44.142
Buy you more time.

19:45.644 --> 19:46.812
How?

19:46.812 --> 19:48.438
I'm gonna show them my claws.

21:06.433 --> 21:07.434
Okay.

21:08.685 --> 21:10.521
Cal, come on. Come on, Cal.

21:36.713 --> 21:38.298
She's mine.

22:13.125 --> 22:14.585
You're trapped, little piggy.

22:50.245 --> 22:51.955
She's gonna kill you.

23:01.632 --> 23:03.467
I won't give her the satisfaction.

25:10.677 --> 25:12.971
"<i>A baby is a dream made real.</i>

25:13.597 --> 25:16.350
<i>But dreams are
the fairies' favorite meal."</i>

25:24.900 --> 25:27.819
<i>"There at the window,
they watch while it sleeps."</i>

25:31.698 --> 25:34.743
<i>"The child so beautiful,
the fairies all weep."</i>

25:39.581 --> 25:43.210
<i>"We want it. We need it.
It's ours for the taking.</i>

25:43.210 --> 25:46.588
<i>A tap at the latch
and the window is shaking."</i>

25:53.470 --> 25:55.973
<i>"Mother and father asleep in their bed.</i>

25:57.349 --> 26:00.310
<i>Fit for the grave,
they rest like the dead."</i>

26:02.104 --> 26:04.606
I am the god Apollo.

26:06.942 --> 26:08.110
I'm the god Apollo.

26:09.486 --> 26:10.821
I'm the god Apollo.

26:11.697 --> 26:14.324
<i>"The young one is gone,
but they'll never know...</i>

26:16.952 --> 26:19.913

<i>hard and cold."</i>

26:25.419 --> 26:28.630
<i>"Now for the fun.
In the woods, there's a party.</i>

26:29.506 --> 26:33.760

close to their breast.</i>

26:59.578 --> 27:01.163
<i>They won't give it back."</i>

27:01.914 --> 27:02.915
Shit.

27:03.749 --> 27:05.334

I'm coming for you.

27:09.046 --> 27:10.464

<i>"They bathe it at dusk.</i>

27:28.315 --> 27:29.816
<i>They hide it with guile.</i>

27:32.027 --> 27:33.529
<i>At home in the forest...</i>

<i>10,000 men with one name.</i>

28:05.602 --> 28:08.021
<i>Tell me your journey, each of you.</i>

28:08.522 --> 28:10.232
<i>Tell me your life's voyage,</i>

<i>and I will tell you who you are.</i>
