00:12.027 --> 00:16.861
The rules of Go are so elegant, organic, and rigorously logical

00:17.536 --> 00:22.316
that if intelligent life exists elsewhere in the universe, they almost certainly play Go.

00:23.122 --> 00:27.038
- Edward Lasker, Chess Grandmaster

00:31.310 --> 00:35.053
If you look at the core of this tree

00:36.076 --> 00:39.460
There are many lines emanating.

00:40.744 --> 00:44.603
You can only get it from a large tree.

00:45.281 --> 00:48.276
Each ring represents one year.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.303
From here to there, that's one hundred years.

00:55.249 --> 00:58.885
Do you see how slowly this tree grew?

01:00.000 --> 01:03.825
Yet its life continues.

01:04.643 --> 01:06.812
That's why it is most fitting

01:07.248 --> 01:09.160
for a Go board to be made from trees.

01:11.528 --> 01:13.838
The board is a window

01:14.078 --> 01:16.456
to the human mind.

01:17.148 --> 01:19.925
Whether we want to or not

01:20.759 --> 01:24.238
it draws a picture of our thoughts

01:24.653 --> 01:27.016
and reveals what is inside us

03:15.801 --> 03:17.790
The key is not to lose a game

03:17.923 --> 03:20.176
or otherwise the top pros probably won't play you.

03:20.379 --> 03:23.440
I don't care about that. Who wants to play the top pros?

03:23.559 --> 03:25.385
Who wants to get their asses kicked?

03:25.520 --> 03:26.139
Me.

03:26.253 --> 03:30.597
So Andy decided he was going to be insane. More so than usual.

03:30.750 --> 03:35.877
He's going to try to win forty games in a row playing against other people online.

03:36.104 --> 03:38.798
And he has 21 hours remaining.

03:40.839 --> 03:42.499
No I know, I need a four.

03:42.612 --> 03:44.398
Call.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.531
So what number win is that?

03:51.000 --> 03:54.961
There are two ways you can get very good at this game.

03:55.201 --> 03:59.838
One: you study very hard, take lots of good lessons

04:00.172 --> 04:02.801
think hard, study, do your homework.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.331
The other:

04:04.544 --> 04:06.628
you play maniacally,

04:06.736 --> 04:09.809
for days on end, without stopping.

04:18.214 --> 04:21.553
Every time I'd go to the Go club in Flushing

04:21.757 --> 04:24.963
I'd always encounter Andy Liu.

04:25.099 --> 04:26.804
He was about 8 years old

04:27.000 --> 04:28.992
and had become very strong already.

04:29.533 --> 04:31.251
I would say he's a genius.

04:31.470 --> 04:34.312
He might have some... mutation?

04:35.563 --> 04:38.512
I don't know how his social skills are,

04:38.644 --> 04:41.388
but on the Go board he's obviously a monster.

04:41.503 --> 04:43.596
He has 18 wins, 0 losses.

04:43.725 --> 04:46.503
So he needs to win another 22 more without losing any

04:46.632 --> 04:48.088
to make it on time.

04:48.210 --> 04:50.158
He doesn't train - 

04:50.294 --> 04:53.718
he just plays 20 games every day online.

04:53.861 --> 04:57.291
But doing that, he's now the strongest player in North America I think.

04:57.423 --> 05:01.280
I think he's stronger than me now, because of his weird style.

05:01.974 --> 05:03.567
You've got five minutes.

05:03.707 --> 05:05.752
It all comes down to this.

05:13.785 --> 05:16.112
There I go - sixty bucks in the bag!

05:16.264 --> 05:18.739
I didn't think you were going to make it! I did not think you were going to make it.

05:18.886 --> 05:22.922
I've never seen anyone play this much... in my entire life.

06:02.442 --> 06:04.748
Once you reach a certain level and you live in the United States

06:04.888 --> 06:07.425
you don't have anyone to play in person.

06:08.374 --> 06:11.472
I mean there's a tiny handful of people who are really serious about it.

06:11.598 --> 06:15.290
And actually, if the bar for being serious about it means going to Asia and training

06:15.439 --> 06:18.422
then maybe I'm the only one.

06:23.341 --> 06:25.147
You win a game, you feel great.

06:25.279 --> 06:27.333
You think about staying in Korea, you think about how great it is.

06:27.477 --> 06:29.992
And when you lose, you think about...

06:31.308 --> 06:33.158
...you know, going back to the US,

06:33.306 --> 06:35.951
going back home, giving it all up.

06:36.086 --> 06:41.171
It's just highs - lows, all day, every day, for years.

06:45.299 --> 06:47.542
I've had these times where it's like...

06:47.701 --> 06:51.407
I'm living my life with these tiny Asian boys and girls.

06:51.568 --> 06:53.489
And I'm just like...

06:53.630 --> 06:55.477
â€¦Where am I?!

07:00.383 --> 07:01.881
I had no choice

07:02.000 --> 07:05.400
given the things I care about, and

07:05.557 --> 07:08.998
given the speed at which I want to improve.

07:10.598 --> 07:12.823
Yeah I don't have much of a choice.

07:30.216 --> 07:33.275
Where did my wife put the filters?

07:33.405 --> 07:38.311
So we've got the coffees here, cake if anybody wants it. All right.

07:38.442 --> 07:43.905
In 1975, walking down 57th street, I go by a little games store.

07:44.061 --> 07:47.155
And I notice that there are two guys playing Go.

07:47.322 --> 07:50.461
I walk in, I say, "Hey, you're playing Go!"

07:50.599 --> 07:52.670
And they said, "You know that this is Go?!"

07:52.813 --> 07:54.273
And I said, "Yeah, sure!"

07:54.425 --> 08:00.110
The rules of Go are very simple. It's played on a grid of lines.

08:01.069 --> 08:06.067
Two players take turns putting stones on the intersections.

08:07.861 --> 08:12.058
Once stones are played on the board, they don't move.

08:12.201 --> 08:14.673
But stones can be captured and removed

08:14.781 --> 08:21.057
if all the empty intersections around them are occupied by their opponent.

08:30.486 --> 08:35.169
The goal of the game is to surround territory with your stones.

08:35.332 --> 08:39.804
At the end of the game, whoever controls more of the board wins.

08:41.285 --> 08:44.234
When you are playing Go,

08:44.351 --> 08:47.301
You're often kinda zoomed in to one corner of the board

08:47.453 --> 08:49.665
and you're thinking about

08:49.816 --> 08:53.885
what's gonna happen locally as a result of making this move.

08:54.146 --> 08:59.814
So I'm gonna go here, then blacks gonna go here, then white goes here and black goes there - oh I see!

08:59.941 --> 09:03.594
Well what if I go here - and there - and blah blah blah.
So you're really zoomed in and you're focusing...

09:03.735 --> 09:09.372
But the thing about Go is that that's happening all over the board at the same time. Right?

09:09.541 --> 09:13.920
Those little situations are emerging here and here and here

09:14.090 --> 09:17.582
and each one of them is its own tactical puzzle

09:17.744 --> 09:22.171
but they're all subtlely connected!

09:22.297 --> 09:25.776
Because the outcome of this tactical situation

09:25.929 --> 09:31.416
is going to exert an influence on this one.

09:34.321 --> 09:37.816
You have these rules that are simple and in a way obvious.

09:37.971 --> 09:44.793
And yet, they lead to this rich, ambiguous, complicated,

09:44.960 --> 09:51.543
subtle, hard-to-predict, and hard-to-understand set of possibilities.

09:51.708 --> 09:55.442
Go is so complex, and so open-ended.

09:55.582 --> 09:59.106
That it requires the intuitive and the aesthetic part of the brain

09:59.256 --> 10:01.080
as much as the analytical part.

10:01.204 --> 10:05.623
So it rewards creativity and analysis simultaneously.

10:05.788 --> 10:09.695
And it's never boring - every game is different.

10:09.863 --> 10:15.555
Go is by far the toughest strategy game for computers.

10:15.714 --> 10:20.417
In chess there's about 35 legal moves on the board at any one time.

10:20.552 --> 10:22.458
In Go, there's over 200.

10:22.602 --> 10:26.544
And so if you want the program to look four moves ahead,

10:26.682 --> 10:30.867
it has to look at 35, and then 35 for each of those, and 35 for each of those in chess.

10:31.182 --> 10:34.979
In Go it's 200 times 200 times 200 times 200.

10:35.156 --> 10:38.804
There is no brute force search for Go, and there never will be.

10:39.100 --> 10:42.297
The only way to simplify that, to be able to manage it

10:42.479 --> 10:46.876
is to have a feeling for the game, and that's the right brain side of the game,

10:47.015 --> 10:51.071
where you go, "Hm, I don't know, but this feels right."

10:51.205 --> 10:54.777
Go is a game that really fits the human mind very well,

10:54.924 --> 10:58.328
it fits with who we are, it fits with our ability

10:58.507 --> 11:02.936
to take a lot of disparate information and make patterns out of it.

11:10.496 --> 11:13.862
To become a professional Go player

11:14.620 --> 11:16.990
you must walk a very arduous path.

11:21.203 --> 11:25.672
You have to give up regular school

11:25.836 --> 11:29.482
leave home when you're about ten years old

11:29.615 --> 11:32.585
and train every day from 8 am to 10 pm.

11:36.515 --> 11:39.802
They start at the age of five or six.

11:42.890 --> 11:48.062
And then become pro, like, 13 or 14.

11:48.168 --> 11:53.362
From our experience, the younger the better.

11:53.515 --> 11:57.013
As you can see these tables are arranged

11:57.168 --> 11:59.960
so you are by yourself.

12:01.950 --> 12:06.493
I only could go back to my hometown like once a year or twice a year

12:06.615 --> 12:07.957
And I remember like

12:08.099 --> 12:11.073
When my - every time my parents called me,

12:11.242 --> 12:12.511
I cried, and I said,

12:12.671 --> 12:15.230
"Oh I miss you, and I wanna just go back."

12:15.395 --> 12:18.490
And my dad always said, "If you want to fulfill your dream,

12:18.649 --> 12:23.921
you have to stay there, you have to study, you have to... work harder."

12:26.223 --> 12:32.080
Most of the people who want to become professionals, they give up their education.

12:32.274 --> 12:36.446
Because they don't have enough time to study both.

12:36.573 --> 12:41.725
Becoming professional is their dream, so they can give up everything.

12:48.152 --> 12:50.502
Only people who have Go deep in their souls

12:50.649 --> 12:52.906
would walk down this path.

13:04.626 --> 13:06.691
It's very different when you're trying to take something

13:06.864 --> 13:10.590
which is not a part of a culture and add it to a culture.

13:16.335 --> 13:20.313
So here, these are all the old pictures.

13:20.478 --> 13:22.881
I mean I always liked it and I always played it,

13:23.032 --> 13:26.136
But I couldn't find other people to play with most of the time.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.988
That's just the way it goes.

13:31.179 --> 13:35.625
In the 50s and 60s, I rarely ran into another Go player.

13:36.899 --> 13:41.321
If I met somebody Asian, I asked, and usually they didn't play either.

13:41.701 --> 13:49.434
There was a time when I think the AGA membership was in significant danger of just going out of existense.

13:49.615 --> 13:53.853
Terry Benson took over, and he served as president for ten years.

13:54.038 --> 13:56.907
My belief is that he probably saved the AGA.

13:57.084 --> 13:59.970
The AGA had fallen to 200 members and nobody was doing anything

14:00.156 --> 14:01.892
and there were checks left in a drawer

14:02.032 --> 14:04.393
So they immediately drew me into the circle.

14:04.647 --> 14:06.278
I started playing tournament Go

14:06.479 --> 14:10.862
And within 8 months I was editing the American Go Journal

14:11.000 --> 14:12.554
We were sitting around talking and we said,

14:12.713 --> 14:16.100
"We oughta have a big tournament. Invite everybody from the whole country, you know?"

14:16.244 --> 14:22.203
I build a big white group with points by the dozen,

14:22.348 --> 14:25.195
right in the center of the board...

14:25.348 --> 14:28.184
Push and cut...small knight's move...one point jump

14:28.351 --> 14:36.534
I've got the move...right...here!

14:41.116 --> 14:49.675
I wanna see Go become a cultural, normal thing in America.

14:49.827 --> 14:53.210
And it's gonna take a while for that to happen in America.

14:53.368 --> 14:57.141
But I think that someday, if somebody says

14:57.276 --> 15:00.435
"Oh yeah, I'm a Go player", they won't have to explain.

15:00.600 --> 15:05.602
I've been dreaming, and preaching, and arguing for growth and promotion

15:05.765 --> 15:10.340
as the number 1 priority for the AGA for many years.

15:10.539 --> 15:12.659
We're 75 years old.

15:12.855 --> 15:18.152
And to have a membership of 2100 or 2200 after 75 years?

15:18.311 --> 15:22.437
It's breathtakingly sad, honestly.

15:31.846 --> 15:35.165
What does the normal college grad do?

15:36.307 --> 15:39.651
I mean who wants to work in a corporation?

15:40.307 --> 15:43.898
Like everybody follows rules, there's cubicles, like you have to work in cubicles,

15:44.075 --> 15:49.560
And everybody receive a memo, like, you know, like, that kind of environment.

15:49.734 --> 15:51.398
I'm a little bit afraid of that.

15:51.670 --> 15:55.004
I could you know try to play Go better but that's not...

15:56.771 --> 16:03.160
that's not meaningful in the sense that it could be a career or whatever.

16:03.339 --> 16:05.666
It's just...

16:05.838 --> 16:07.952
not a career path.

16:09.924 --> 16:16.716
This is every pro that became professional from one of the three schools,

16:16.871 --> 16:20.653
going back to the very first one which is my teacher.

16:22.701 --> 16:26.333
There... you just don't go. You don't go to A.

16:26.627 --> 16:29.858
You don't breathe the rarified air

16:30.060 --> 16:30.894
of A.

16:31.051 --> 16:37.411
That's all... that's our top professional study group, basically.

16:37.530 --> 16:40.410
And this door, I dunno, what do you think - 

16:40.570 --> 16:45.233
can I open it and go in? I hear people in there...

17:46.599 --> 17:49.607
We've always referred to China, Korea and Japan

17:49.956 --> 17:51.088
as the Three Kingdoms of Go.

17:51.219 --> 17:54.153
It has been passed down generation after generation

17:54.294 --> 17:56.528
each stronger than the last.

17:58.849 --> 18:02.793
The Ing Cup is known as the Olympics of Go.

18:06.176 --> 18:09.724
The top prize is $400,000.

18:20.238 --> 18:22.713
There is chess in the West

18:22.890 --> 18:28.559
but Go is incomparably more subtle.

18:28.702 --> 18:31.545
It is the most difficult game

18:31.711 --> 18:33.720
ever devised by human beings.

18:46.356 --> 18:52.458
Passing down the beauty of Go to many people

18:52.609 --> 18:57.653
is a professional's responsibility.

18:57.780 --> 19:00.154
Handing down this beauty

19:00.279 --> 19:03.943
is as important as winning prize money.

19:04.061 --> 19:07.581
The level of the whole Go world...

19:07.726 --> 19:11.662
improving the global level of Go is what's most important.

19:11.950 --> 19:14.653
That is the direction everyone

19:15.046 --> 19:16.170
especially professionals

19:16.319 --> 19:18.415
should move towards.

19:25.726 --> 19:27.686
At the highest levels,

19:27.838 --> 19:31.316
What the pros are thinking about is...

19:31.478 --> 19:36.051
several orders of magnitude more than what any of the amateurs think about.

19:36.211 --> 19:39.535
Eveyone starts as a beginner, where you know how to put the stones on the board,

19:39.691 --> 19:42.274
how to capture, how to get to the end of the game.

19:42.435 --> 19:45.599
But every level above that, you're learning something.

19:46.562 --> 19:49.199
The ranking system starts at 30 kyu.

19:49.370 --> 19:54.088
As you improve, you move up: 20 kyu, 10 kyu, 1 kyu.

19:54.255 --> 20:00.317
Then you enter the black belt master ranks: 1 dan, 2 dan, up to 9 dan.

20:00.478 --> 20:02.906
And above that are the professionals:

20:03.082 --> 20:07.865
pro 1 dan, pro 2 dan, all the way to pro 9 dan.

20:11.147 --> 20:14.853
I'm Gregory Marshall and I'm a 16 kyu.

20:16.405 --> 20:18.309
My name's Rachel Small. I am playing as a 9 kyu.

20:18.426 --> 20:21.703
My name is Larry Mornhinveg. I'm theoretically a 6 kyu.

20:22.052 --> 20:27.679
Somewhere around 5 kyu, at least in my experience, it starts getting a little... thick.

20:27.854 --> 20:29.737
It's a little tougher to move up.

20:29.892 --> 20:32.957
Oh lord, I've been a 4 kyu for so long.

20:33.551 --> 20:40.484
Among the dan level players, we kyu have not yet begun to learn.

20:40.637 --> 20:45.575
You'll almost definitely play at least close to a thousand games to become a dan player.

20:45.733 --> 20:50.646
After that, you're on the road of playing serious Go.

20:50.829 --> 20:54.782
When I was around 4 kyu, 3 kyu, in there, I became convinced

20:54.956 --> 20:57.653
I'm gonna have this game down, you know?

20:57.817 --> 21:01.794
and then you get to 1 dan, 2 dan, and you start realizing...

21:01.985 --> 21:03.698
oh crap!

21:03.876 --> 21:05.689
I don't know anything!

21:05.863 --> 21:12.793
For the top amateur players and all the professionals, what they are considering, what they are thinking about

21:12.956 --> 21:16.058
is almost beyond my comprehension.

21:16.243 --> 21:20.101
They will be thinking about 20 and 30 move sequences,

21:20.243 --> 21:24.268
using their knowledge base of shapes and patterns.

21:24.446 --> 21:29.666
At the top level, they are in a different world, frankly.

21:33.996 --> 21:37.666
You know, in the past 20 years, a lot of AGA organizers,

21:37.816 --> 21:41.546
they put a lot of time and a lot of effort into youth activities.

21:41.702 --> 21:47.830
We have built up a collection of... awesomely strong kid players.

21:48.678 --> 21:52.486
And we needed to be in the position

21:52.676 --> 21:55.167
to give them some kind of a next step.

22:00.755 --> 22:04.310
My name is Myungwan Kim. I came from Korea.

22:05.169 --> 22:11.074
and I'm a certified 9-dan professional from the Korean Go Association.

22:11.249 --> 22:15.441
Myungwan came over as an ambassador for the Korean Baduk Association.

22:15.594 --> 22:19.028
The first thing he said to me was, "Well, we need a professional system in the United States."

22:19.185 --> 22:25.333
You need to have a professional system to have geniuses, you know.

22:25.521 --> 22:30.611
Just one or two people, one or two genius, can change the picture.

22:30.772 --> 22:34.273
He came back and said, "I wanna - I've found you a sponsor".

22:35.773 --> 22:38.987
And they've agreed to support a qualification tournament.

22:39.155 --> 22:41.965
And I said, "Oh, well, now that might be different!"

22:42.608 --> 22:45.916
Good evening and welcome to all our distinguished visitors

22:46.104 --> 22:54.521
as we witness the first qualifying tournament for the AGA professional certification system.

22:55.721 --> 23:01.724
There will be 16 finalists, and they play to pick 2 professionals.

23:01.900 --> 23:06.920
It's the first time outside of Asia that an organization is certifying professionals.

23:07.104 --> 23:10.330
But we will have our own unique American brand.

23:10.486 --> 23:13.875
It's very much a beginning for us

23:14.020 --> 23:19.183
because we really don't know what an American professional system is going to look like.

23:19.370 --> 23:21.148
So what'd you get? Did you get me anything?

23:21.307 --> 23:25.917
Uh, I got Pringles, beef jerky, Doritos, and Naked Juice.

23:36.986 --> 23:42.235
Welcome. We will be playing three rounds today, and two rounds tomorrow.

23:42.465 --> 23:47.164
The winner of this tournament will have the opportunity to go to North Carolina this summer

23:47.371 --> 23:51.610
to compete to become one of the first two

23:51.738 --> 23:56.404
homegrown and homemade American pros.

23:59.656 --> 24:04.190
At meetings, I derided the idea that this country was ready for a pro system.

24:04.338 --> 24:10.190
That being said, it was an opportunity that was hard to say no to.

24:16.160 --> 24:19.927
Back in the states to play in this professional tournament.

24:20.096 --> 24:23.696
You know, it's.. it's not the seriousness of Asia, but

24:23.914 --> 24:27.927
I think it's the first time in ten years where I've seen some serious stab at it.

24:39.403 --> 24:43.659
Easy work... easy work.

24:43.879 --> 24:47.314
Because of the shortage of liberties, but here he's just not going to...

24:47.595 --> 24:49.664
You didn't... you didn't turn.

24:49.797 --> 24:52.905
So now he's just gonna push and play here.

24:57.288 --> 24:58.852
Ready to... ready to kill him!

25:11.545 --> 25:13.668
This could get ugly.

25:13.817 --> 25:15.709
I like ugly games.

25:15.849 --> 25:17.688
His playing style is hyper-aggressive

25:17.861 --> 25:21.292
with no regards for his own safety or the safety of his opponent.

25:30.915 --> 25:35.431
For the AGA professional selection tournament, the winner is Benjamin Lockhart.

25:40.520 --> 25:46.027
And first place, undefeated, is Zhiyuan Liu.

25:47.709 --> 25:54.046
An invitation to the first AGA professional selection tournament: Curtis Tang.

25:56.642 --> 26:01.356
The tournament was great. I thought the muffins were great, the chocolate chip cookies, the coffee.

26:10.836 --> 26:15.845
Twenty two, twenty three, twenty four, twenty five, twenty six, twenty seven, twenty eight...

26:15.988 --> 26:18.525
Actually I need a container for this shit.

26:18.700 --> 26:21.851
I'm just gonna do this.

26:26.243 --> 26:28.933
- You know, help yourself.
- Sure.

26:30.336 --> 26:33.292
- How much is that?
- $780.00

26:39.218 --> 26:43.359
Andy, he's like a huge favorite.
You know who I think is the second favorite?

26:43.555 --> 26:46.632
Dude I think you're number two. That's my opinion. I think Calvin Sun's a...

26:46.795 --> 26:47.717
No, no, no. I'm not.

26:48.739 --> 26:50.447
You know where I'm really confident in myself?

26:50.599 --> 26:52.376
I'm confident with my poker skills.

26:54.505 --> 26:58.059
Yeah dude, we're gonna be playing a lot of poker, but we'll be careful about getting enough sleep.

26:58.223 --> 26:59.695
I mean I'm gonna take it pretty seriously.

26:59.878 --> 27:03.038
Oh YOU'RE gonna take it seriously for the Pro Qualifier?

27:03.192 --> 27:07.840
Yeah dude, do you understand that I've been training, for a long time, in Korea?

27:08.014 --> 27:09.870
- Do you know what the fuck I've been...
- Wait, how long, how long?

27:10.001 --> 27:11.336
You're not going to college?

27:12.212 --> 27:15.176
Well not yet. I don't think I'm ever going to go to college.

27:15.328 --> 27:19.481
I think it would just be like too much time... of my life.

27:20.782 --> 27:23.700
I just hope you don't fall into the old way of thinking about playing Go.

27:23.885 --> 27:28.285
Oh dude, I am... the most important thing to me is winning. Period.

27:28.443 --> 27:30.512
I don't care about like the beauty of the game anymore.

27:30.649 --> 27:33.658
You have to fight. You always have to resist and fight.

27:33.827 --> 27:38.317
Oh shit oh shit oh shit.
I think Ben is getting the concept now.

27:53.197 --> 27:56.395
The origin of Go is very mysterious.

27:57.710 --> 28:02.814
Chinese history goes back 5000 years

28:04.828 --> 28:10.071
but many ancient records are essentially legend.

28:12.566 --> 28:16.668
About the origin of Go, there is one story.

28:16.828 --> 28:19.735
People who wanted to observe the universe

28:19.913 --> 28:24.326
would use a net to envelop the sky

28:24.512 --> 28:27.878
and record the location of the stars

28:28.054 --> 28:32.464
at the crossing threads.

28:36.999 --> 28:42.856
The oldest evidence we do have is 6th century BC.

28:43.767 --> 28:47.689
At least then, we had clearly a Go game,

28:47.884 --> 28:52.590
but still we don't know how big the Go board was at that time.

28:58.331 --> 29:03.705
In China, traditionally, Go was one of the four Fine Arts.

29:04.000 --> 29:08.472
There's music, and painting, and calligraphy, and Go.

29:08.599 --> 29:15.366
And when Japan acquired the game in the 8th century, it was considered as a fine art.

29:19.639 --> 29:23.604
Before the Tang dynasty Go had reached Japan.

29:23.753 --> 29:26.859
Go advanced so much in Japan

29:27.000 --> 29:30.724
they left China and the other countries far behind.

29:35.362 --> 29:39.132
These are the official Go archives.

29:40.560 --> 29:44.159
This room is used to present the history of Go.

29:52.538 --> 29:55.356
In the tale of Genji, the game of Go is mentioned.

29:55.511 --> 29:59.473
So we know that Go was played by the Buddhist clergy.

29:59.633 --> 30:02.150
It was played at the royal court.

30:02.436 --> 30:07.401
In ancient times, Japan was a very rigid hierarchy.

30:07.536 --> 30:09.533
But Go game the common man

30:09.658 --> 30:13.916
a way to climb the social ladder.

30:14.055 --> 30:16.472
If a person played Go very well

30:16.607 --> 30:20.024
they could speak with the top government officials!

30:20.160 --> 30:26.187
During the 17th and 18th and 19th centuries, Japan was the center of the Go playing world.

30:26.342 --> 30:30.999
And it was regarded so highly that they decided to subsidize Go

30:31.122 --> 30:37.385
and during the entire Edo shogunate, from 1612 for the next well over 200 years,

30:37.511 --> 30:40.651
the best Go players enjoyed a stipend from the goverment.

30:40.780 --> 30:44.733
And it just produced a whole string of tremendous players.

30:53.000 --> 30:56.824
Go Seigen was a Chinese Go player who was discovered

30:56.962 --> 31:01.600
when some Japanese players visited China, and brought over to Japan.

31:01.736 --> 31:07.808
And, even before he was 20 years old, he was one of the top players in Japan.

31:07.951 --> 31:10.434
And they organized a series of ten-game matches

31:10.564 --> 31:13.391
between him and other leading Japanese players.

31:13.513 --> 31:15.899
And he won almost all of these matches.

31:16.049 --> 31:21.591
Over time he defeated all the other strongest Japanese players.

31:21.731 --> 31:24.837
He sorta... changed the flow of the game.

31:24.953 --> 31:26.628
When I was a child

31:26.756 --> 31:31.217
I had a chance to see one of Go Seigen's games.

31:31.340 --> 31:35.400
This was in the old days.

31:35.536 --> 31:39.369
when it was not easy to get close to the players.

31:39.525 --> 31:44.088
I was looking at Go Seigen's back

31:44.242 --> 31:47.560
and I saw an aura, a glowing aura.

31:48.845 --> 31:51.372
I don't know if anyone else saw it.

31:51.504 --> 31:53.457
but I felt it that way.

31:54.157 --> 31:57.216
To us Go Seigen was not human

31:57.348 --> 32:00.313
but something way above.

32:00.456 --> 32:03.046
A whole different level.

32:13.098 --> 32:17.920
This board is signed by master Go Seigen.

32:24.889 --> 32:27.369
It's from 70 years ago, I believe.

32:33.002 --> 32:33.992
All right, everybody in!

32:36.416 --> 32:38.359
Now what we have to do is, like,

32:38.487 --> 32:42.235
let each other show off, by laying down something really simple.

32:42.369 --> 32:44.693
- I'm happy with that.
- For the other person to show off.

32:53.933 --> 32:54.970
Andy on the track.

32:56.652 --> 32:57.666
It's Andy on the track.

32:57.807 --> 33:00.062
It's Andy on the track!

33:03.510 --> 33:05.441
And it's Andy on the track.

33:19.953 --> 33:24.969
The Go Congress is the national gathering for 400 dedicated Go players.

33:25.097 --> 33:28.844
If you play Go, it's the place to be for a week.

33:28.978 --> 33:32.853
This is a Go board in the shape of the United States.

33:32.978 --> 33:35.534
This is blind Go and the white pieces are flat

33:35.688 --> 33:39.668
so the players who are blindfolded can tell what they're doing.

33:39.807 --> 33:41.175
This is spiral Go.

33:41.320 --> 33:43.417
This is the 3-4-6-4 tesselation.

33:43.538 --> 33:45.197
Ohp! Somebody just got captured.

33:45.318 --> 33:49.405
Two gold stones just got captured by red green and blue.

33:50.320 --> 33:54.168
This is my 26th Congress in a row.

33:54.311 --> 33:57.034
Go had to take the place of sex for me, for a year,

33:57.147 --> 33:59.289
and it's kind of scary how well it did.

33:59.440 --> 34:02.326
Well, I have ko tattooed on my back.

34:02.464 --> 34:04.999
Even though the stones don't move, once they're on the board

34:05.125 --> 34:07.434
they sorta develop these cloud shapes,

34:07.561 --> 34:09.603
forming and reforming.

34:09.733 --> 34:12.338
It's an iconic Congress because someone goes pro -

34:12.467 --> 34:14.234
the first US pro - that's amazing.

34:14.342 --> 34:17.500
Outside of Asia, we're the first Western country to do this.

34:17.610 --> 34:20.311
We're gonna find our Bobby Fischer

34:20.418 --> 34:22.710
who is gonna energize the whole country.

34:22.847 --> 34:25.277
And we will become internationally competitive.

34:51.011 --> 34:53.562
So the main thing about the tournament is that

34:53.685 --> 34:55.884
we have a couple of constraints.

34:56.002 --> 34:58.172
One is we only have a week to do it in.

34:58.296 --> 35:03.343
But two, we need to be sure that we've selected the strongest people.

35:03.464 --> 35:08.264
So, one of the best ways to do that is a double-elimination tournament.

35:08.391 --> 35:11.161
So people come in, they start playing here.

35:11.271 --> 35:13.804
And as they win they go through this bracket.

35:13.929 --> 35:16.010
If you lose, you drop through here.

35:16.125 --> 35:19.016
And, if you manage to beat everybody else,

35:19.141 --> 35:23.346
you can still manage to turn up as one of the pros.

35:28.102 --> 35:32.234
I need everybody to come up and initial by it

35:32.366 --> 35:35.432
indicating that you agree to the rating shown.

35:38.459 --> 35:41.480
I really want to thank you all for coming here.

35:41.589 --> 35:45.053
When we decided to try this difficult experiment,

35:45.173 --> 35:47.471
we put American Go on a new heading.

35:48.611 --> 35:54.045
And we don't know exactly where it's going to wind up.

35:54.169 --> 35:56.194
We're trying to make an American Go community where

35:57.222 --> 36:01.117
when someone decides to put as much time and as much effort and as much passion

36:01.251 --> 36:04.463
into the game as you guys have,

36:04.562 --> 36:09.655
they can go as far as hard work and talent will take them.

36:12.205 --> 36:15.618
All right, the official start.
Begin your games, enjoy.

38:18.629 --> 38:22.436
How did I manage? How did I manage to lose that game?

38:22.565 --> 38:25.079
Unbelievable.

38:27.589 --> 38:31.228
You lost. Bill Lin lost. Ben lost.

38:31.345 --> 38:33.539
He threw it away. You got your ass kicked.

38:33.660 --> 38:35.192
Bill Lin got his ass kicked.

38:35.296 --> 38:38.717
I am so fucking pissed right now.

38:42.027 --> 38:44.918
But I really threw it away.

38:45.018 --> 38:47.717
Really whooping his ass. All game.

38:47.832 --> 38:50.444
I thought I was like ahead the entire game, like ahead.

38:50.565 --> 38:53.522
And I thought I was just controlling the entire game.

38:53.640 --> 38:55.998
Then eventually I ended up losing that much.

38:56.125 --> 38:58.627
How much?

38:58.733 --> 39:01.021
- 7.5 dude.
- Shit.

39:01.125 --> 39:05.202
Dude that was the biggest upset in Go history, I think.

39:05.320 --> 39:09.297
Oh my God. Your arrogance. Both your arrogance.

39:09.418 --> 39:11.771
Oh my fucking God dude.

39:11.884 --> 39:15.399
- That game - this game was way too huge.
- I know.

39:15.509 --> 39:17.752
- You can't lose the first game, dude.
- It's huge.

39:17.850 --> 39:19.172
You really can't.

39:21.000 --> 39:24.272
One of the striking things is time just disappears.

39:24.391 --> 39:27.736
You're so absorbed in the game, and it's just... it's just the most refreshing thing.

39:27.863 --> 39:30.474
Instead of having all this clutter in your head

39:30.590 --> 39:31.960
and worry about things

39:32.062 --> 39:35.283
You're just absorbed in this ideal world of the Go board.

39:35.391 --> 39:36.939
But it's a long process.

39:37.024 --> 39:40.580
And somewhere in the middle of the game...

39:40.685 --> 39:43.694
One has to encounter, or one comes to terms

39:43.814 --> 39:46.406
with one's own imperfections.

39:46.515 --> 39:51.173
A certain kind of impatience, or fear, or greed.

39:51.279 --> 39:53.622
And it's like some of the beautiful elements of the Go

39:53.731 --> 39:58.655
is suddenly become clouded with all these other emotions, so it's...

40:01.611 --> 40:05.763
At the heart of Go is a concept called emergence.

40:06.244 --> 40:11.745
How do you go from something that's obvious to something that's non-obvious, right?

40:11.855 --> 40:16.719
How do you go from something that's simple to something that's complex?

40:16.831 --> 40:20.247
So a stone's empty neighbors are called its liberties.

40:20.367 --> 40:24.711
And I can capture a group by filling in all of its liberties.

40:24.831 --> 40:29.718
When there's one liberty left, we say that that group is in atari.

40:29.853 --> 40:34.393
Then, with one more move, I can capture them.

40:34.954 --> 40:36.813
Now this group is harder to capture.

40:36.926 --> 40:41.426
Because if I put a white stone in the middle, it actually gets captured first.

40:42.122 --> 40:47.261
So instead, I have to surround the outside first, putting black in atari.

40:47.391 --> 40:51.707
Only then can I play in the middle and capture them.

40:51.831 --> 40:54.411
Now, what about this group?

40:54.538 --> 40:58.350
Even after I surround the outside, wherever white plays next,

40:58.464 --> 41:01.961
white would be captured first.

41:03.167 --> 41:05.586
So actually, black can never be captured,

41:05.707 --> 41:08.276
because it has these two internal liberties

41:08.402 --> 41:10.869
which we call eyes.

41:11.000 --> 41:15.093
and any group with two eyes can never be captured.

41:15.220 --> 41:18.255
A fundamental strategy concept in Go

41:18.365 --> 41:22.024
is to make two eyes when your groups come under attack.

41:25.026 --> 41:26.878
Now there's no rule in Go that says

41:27.011 --> 41:29.118
you can't capture a group with two eyes.

41:29.244 --> 41:33.014
It just follows necessarily from the existing rules.

41:33.144 --> 41:38.594
And this is a very simple example of what we mean by emergence.

41:41.391 --> 41:47.370
So there are lots of examples of this in the world.

41:47.489 --> 41:53.175
How do we get from atoms interacting according to the laws of physics,

41:53.312 --> 41:55.610
to thinking?

41:56.929 --> 42:02.437
How do we get from the material stuff of the grey matter inside your head

42:02.562 --> 42:08.136
to the sensation of being alive, to consciousness?

42:08.271 --> 42:11.052
And it's hard to see how it's even possible that they could arise

42:11.159 --> 42:15.340
from the operation of simple, deterministic rules.

42:17.025 --> 42:19.545
And yet, here's Go to show us that...

42:19.665 --> 42:23.072
it's all of a piece, right?

42:23.196 --> 42:24.908
That those things can exist -

42:25.023 --> 42:28.154
that the mysterious and the obvious

42:28.264 --> 42:32.068
can exist in the same square.

42:32.807 --> 42:35.065
So I'm playing against Justin Teng.

42:35.188 --> 42:36.902
- Huh, nice.
- Who's Andrew Lu playing?

42:37.038 --> 42:39.120
Matthew Burrall is losing, Andrew Lu is losing -

42:39.221 --> 42:40.674
Dude I'm gonna be playing Matthew Burrall.

42:40.782 --> 42:47.270
Which means you're going to be covering the unofficial white man championship.

42:47.392 --> 42:49.584
I think Ben's the strongest white guy in America.

42:49.709 --> 42:50.879
- Really?
- But that's not saying anything.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.236
We'll bet on that game.

42:52.332 --> 42:54.404
- I'll best on Matthew.
- Really?

43:42.660 --> 43:45.760
We create these things

43:45.872 --> 43:50.641
because we've seen the treasure concealed in Go.

43:55.636 --> 44:00.345
This wood is in the process of drying.

44:02.731 --> 44:04.081
They have to dry in the shade

44:04.194 --> 44:07.266
for up to ten years

44:07.375 --> 44:09.510
because they're quite thick.

44:10.291 --> 44:14.596
This is my second older brother.

44:15.927 --> 44:17.124
He's the craftsman.

44:17.244 --> 44:19.651
49 years!

44:19.796 --> 44:23.793
I've been making Go boards since I was 13 years old.

44:23.941 --> 44:26.417
First I put this on the board.

44:26.538 --> 44:29.868
And then with a drafting machine.

44:29.986 --> 44:33.187
Up and down, up and down.

44:33.293 --> 44:36.710
I draw all these lines by hand.

44:36.831 --> 44:42.504
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

44:44.024 --> 44:47.885
These are shells for making stones.

44:51.978 --> 44:56.999
A clam has to die and be submerged underwater

44:57.112 --> 44:59.595
for decades before you can get this.

45:03.000 --> 45:06.454
This board is made of Gingko tree.

45:06.587 --> 45:10.690
The tree is 500 years old.

45:12.555 --> 45:17.188
Everything is made with purpose.

45:19.831 --> 45:24.451
The baby turtles hold the stones.

45:27.953 --> 45:31.746
Why do we make the board out of trees?

45:31.869 --> 45:35.363
We use wood because it represents the Earth

45:35.489 --> 45:40.058
to express what happens in this world on the board.

45:42.000 --> 45:45.504
As we protect our territory

45:45.636 --> 45:48.172
we build upon what came before.

45:48.318 --> 45:50.890
We position ourselves more firmly

45:51.024 --> 45:55.349
on the path we have chosen.

46:18.584 --> 46:21.520
Yang Jing just made a ko in Calvin's corner.

46:21.644 --> 46:23.445
So Calvin's still struggling,

46:23.558 --> 46:24.830
but he's probably done.

46:29.709 --> 46:32.495
I kinda wanted to go further but...

46:32.611 --> 46:36.121
I mean, these people are too strong.

46:52.856 --> 46:57.305
That is one whitey down.

46:57.454 --> 47:01.498
- Last whitey standing?
- Go to White Castle to celebrate.

47:01.636 --> 47:06.236
I'm just happy that I'm not fucking out.

47:07.685 --> 47:10.631
You can see the competition sparking among them

47:10.755 --> 47:17.353
and you can see how the games seem to be inspiring them and driving them that much further

47:17.489 --> 47:19.908
and that's everything you can hope for.

47:20.026 --> 47:23.357
So right now, it's been a dream.

47:23.527 --> 47:28.126
In America, yeah - it might be very difficult

47:28.280 --> 47:33.012
to push a kid to study more than ten hours.

47:33.173 --> 47:37.580
They don't - you know they don't study that much, not like Asia.

47:37.739 --> 47:40.798
But still I think

47:40.956 --> 47:44.088
it's possible to be a very good professional.

47:44.222 --> 47:46.781
There are always, like, pros and cons, you know.

47:46.929 --> 47:49.840
If you want to gain something, you have to sacrifice the other one.

47:58.342 --> 48:01.888
I grew up playing little math puzzles and games.

48:02.027 --> 48:05.931
I was thinking you take me, I take you, then that, I would go there

48:06.088 --> 48:08.148
- OR there.
- Very nice...

48:10.611 --> 48:14.683
From the ages of nine to fifteen,

48:14.830 --> 48:18.914
Go was always just the thing I was best at and by far the most talented at.

48:20.391 --> 48:23.437
There was this time where it's like, I'm sixteen.

48:23.567 --> 48:27.570
I spend my time studying Go, walk in the park.

48:27.709 --> 48:32.695
But my priority was always just getting outside of school,

48:32.830 --> 48:35.510
and outside of having to be somewhere.

48:36.171 --> 48:40.246
Andy and I would just stay there all night, playing online or against each other

48:40.404 --> 48:42.262
six or sevens hours,

48:42.397 --> 48:46.792
get fast food or whatever food was open at 4 am.

48:46.929 --> 48:49.965
You know, both skip school the next day.

48:50.428 --> 48:53.639
You develop too much of a relationship with something

48:53.773 --> 48:56.251
and then, especially if you don't suck at it

48:56.393 --> 48:59.938
it becomes impossible to pull away.

49:46.858 --> 49:47.918
There's a saying in China:

49:48.051 --> 49:50.969
one wrong move and the world crumbles.

49:52.589 --> 49:54.889
The first time Japan sent a Go delegation to China

49:55.024 --> 49:57.841
was in 1960.

49:57.978 --> 50:00.752
But they have no chance agains the Japanese players.

50:00.905 --> 50:03.328
They were way behind.

50:03.467 --> 50:09.957
For a long time, China was trying to catch up with Japan, and Korea too.

50:10.100 --> 50:12.320
And eventually they did.

50:12.467 --> 50:15.994
And for historical reasons in China and especially Korea,

50:16.139 --> 50:18.383
beating Japan is very big.

50:19.002 --> 50:21.395
In the 1960's we entered the New China era.

50:21.538 --> 50:23.642
After the founding of the People's Republic of China

50:23.782 --> 50:27.050
came the greatest development of Go

50:27.210 --> 50:31.702
because the government gave it unprecedented importance.

50:31.856 --> 50:34.742
They started producing some strong players.

50:34.880 --> 50:38.240
In the 1970s, China had Nie Weiping

50:38.376 --> 50:42.355
and he could beat most of the Japanese pros and he did it repeatedly.

50:42.467 --> 50:46.034
And this of course caused a sensation in China.

50:46.149 --> 50:49.404
My happiest memory was the China-Japan Super Go tournament.

50:49.534 --> 50:52.373
which I won three times in a row.

50:52.489 --> 50:53.446
It was miraculous!

50:53.583 --> 50:57.864
And afterwards I got a call from Prime Minister Deng Xiaoping

50:58.002 --> 50:59.369
congratulating me.

50:59.526 --> 51:03.977
As for Korea, one of their strongest players was Cho Hunhyun,

51:04.105 --> 51:06.294
who made pro at the age of 9.

51:06.442 --> 51:10.004
And when they started playing international games professionally,

51:10.162 --> 51:11.809
he won the first Ing Cup.

51:21.834 --> 51:23.869
All of a sudden after winning the match

51:24.000 --> 51:26.648
they told me to get in a convertible

51:26.792 --> 51:31.599
Since I was the winner I had to get in.

51:31.733 --> 51:34.712
And we were riding in a parage from Gimpo airport.

51:34.831 --> 51:40.197
before I even knew what was happening.

51:40.345 --> 51:44.038
After Cho Hunhyun won the Ing Cup

51:44.171 --> 51:46.840
the media began covering the game extensively.

51:50.737 --> 51:56.503
The attitude towards Go was changed totally.

51:56.650 --> 52:03.153
We became thinking like... Go is not a philosophy but a game or a sport.

52:03.296 --> 52:05.721
The starting age became lower and lower.

52:05.856 --> 52:07.829
These days we start

52:07.953 --> 52:10.337
as young as kindergarten.

52:12.051 --> 52:16.005
If you become pro at the age of 13,

52:16.152 --> 52:20.412
then you have a good chance to become world's best player.

52:20.565 --> 52:25.761
But if you are already 15, you won't have any chance.

52:25.905 --> 52:34.826
At that time, it was not considered as late, but these days, too late.

52:35.782 --> 52:38.698
When I was learning we studied the Japanese style.

52:38.829 --> 52:41.716
which focused on being aesthetically pleasing.

52:41.829 --> 52:46.768
Today it's impossible to win with that style.

52:50.882 --> 52:56.025
Because now winning is everything.

53:12.848 --> 53:14.473
I won.

53:16.186 --> 53:17.655
Ben is black.

53:18.197 --> 53:20.228
No, black doesn't win. There's too many liberties.

53:20.369 --> 53:24.811
There's seven, oh, yeah. There's one - yeah, black, I don't think...

53:43.002 --> 53:46.707
Oh my goodness. Dude, like, he's not clutch.

53:46.855 --> 53:47.885
What do you mean? He died.

53:48.051 --> 53:50.645
I said, I said Ben is not clutch.

53:50.942 --> 53:52.819
Ben's gonna be pretty mad.

53:52.978 --> 53:54.814
He's gonna be so pissed.

53:58.112 --> 53:59.814
So, he resigned?

53:59.933 --> 54:01.847
He resigned.

54:04.259 --> 54:05.652
It went so fast.

54:05.768 --> 54:08.323
He put two stones on the board.

54:08.450 --> 54:10.221
He resigned.

54:30.560 --> 54:32.036
Threw it away.

54:34.393 --> 54:37.061
Why did you connect? You wanted to kill more?

54:37.454 --> 54:40.380
I dunno. I hallucinated.

54:40.514 --> 54:42.407
I thought either way lived.

54:43.418 --> 54:44.467
Why is Andy winning?

54:44.589 --> 54:45.899
Of course Andy's winning.

54:46.024 --> 54:48.975
Why did you play so fast? You had so much time left.

54:49.589 --> 54:51.600
Why didn't you like take 30 minutes

54:51.728 --> 54:54.712
and figure out almost all the variations.

54:56.174 --> 54:58.895
That's sloppy, dude.

54:59.027 --> 55:01.161
I got sloppy.

55:09.031 --> 55:10.268
I won.

55:20.537 --> 55:22.033
Andy won?

55:27.835 --> 55:30.221
Come on in, take your seats.

55:31.903 --> 55:37.603
I've spent many, I've spent several hours in front of a Go board every day for the past two years.

55:41.367 --> 55:47.968
I mean, the first time I didn't sit in front of a Go board for 24 hours was

55:48.784 --> 55:54.599
my plane right back from Korea, a week and a half ago.

55:54.709 --> 55:58.675
And then the first thing I did when I landed in New York was go upstairs and...

55:58.804 --> 56:03.659
I've never - I mean it's the only thing

56:03.748 --> 56:07.330
where I've ever just given 100%, you know?

56:25.071 --> 56:29.460
My ideas about life all - the only consistent pattern is

56:29.587 --> 56:32.531
that the way you should spend your life is by playing aroun with your brain.

56:32.685 --> 56:34.009
What else are you gonna do?

56:34.147 --> 56:39.733
You know, run around, trying to get super rich and just kind of...

56:39.881 --> 56:44.133
Engage in all sorts of...

56:44.256 --> 56:46.418
like, carnal pleasures?

56:46.552 --> 56:49.943
And that's what you're going to spend your life trying to do?

56:50.100 --> 56:54.149
I don't even know if that's - well that's pretty gross to me.

56:54.293 --> 56:59.258
I'm just saying it's not easy to feel - it's not easy for me

56:59.416 --> 57:02.466
to feel OK with things... in this world.

57:05.685 --> 57:10.971
I want to spend all my time in the world of Go

57:11.391 --> 57:16.031
and I don't really want to spend much time dealing with the real world.

57:27.358 --> 57:29.759
He won.

57:43.978 --> 57:46.677
Un-fucking-believable.

57:48.976 --> 57:53.739
Dude on a scale of 1 to 10 right now, I'm like 7.5 pissed.

57:55.423 --> 57:57.750
Oh my... Dude I think I should quit Go dude.

57:57.919 --> 58:00.702
Like before I thought I had a chance to beat Andy.

58:00.856 --> 58:03.841
Right now like I can't even beat them.

58:05.636 --> 58:09.842
I was lucky that game. I did not play well. I did not play well.

58:13.611 --> 58:15.977
I just want Andy to lose a game.

58:16.107 --> 58:19.475
Dude it can't happen. Andy can't lose unless he wants to, it's fucked.

58:19.587 --> 58:21.765
Dude that's not, that's definitely not true.

58:21.880 --> 58:23.195
Gansheng...

58:23.335 --> 58:25.936
Gansheng, please beat Hugh Zhang so I can play you.

58:26.062 --> 58:27.815
I know your style.

58:27.953 --> 58:29.368
Oh shit.

58:29.489 --> 58:30.899
Oh shit!

58:31.024 --> 58:32.402
Is that a challenge?

58:32.511 --> 58:35.576
If you beat Andy 2-0, I will finally admit -

58:37.953 --> 58:40.076
I'm gonna be in the finals playing Andy Liu.

58:40.196 --> 58:43.279
And you know, he's a, he's a strong opponent, you know.

58:43.392 --> 58:47.458
I just think...

58:47.587 --> 58:51.853
He has a different mindset, and you know, he doesn't play the normal moves.

58:51.978 --> 58:54.836
And I think I just gotta play solid with him, you know,

58:54.986 --> 58:57.310
not make too many mistakes.

58:57.440 --> 58:59.780
Try, you know, try as hard as I can.

59:03.477 --> 59:12.351
Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one

59:19.051 --> 59:22.493
I'm sort of like a perfectionist so I think like

59:22.636 --> 59:27.042
our brainpower is, like, not nearly enough.

59:27.173 --> 59:29.280
Multiply our brainpower by a million,

59:29.420 --> 59:31.766
and our imaginations would still not be rich enough.

59:36.636 --> 59:40.237
Take every possible configuration of matter in the universe

59:40.369 --> 59:43.221
Arrange the universe in all possible configurations

59:43.369 --> 59:46.741
and you've come up with some pretty intelligent beings.

59:49.029 --> 59:52.346
Hyper-intelligent beings who would just look at the world,

59:52.500 --> 59:57.739
and then the ability to predict everything that would happen afterwards.

01:00:00.027 --> 01:00:06.318
My lifetime goal would just be to be reincarnated as a far higher being.

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:11.058
Imagine an intelligent being that does not have, like, an ego.

01:00:11.201 --> 01:00:16.198
It won't have emotions. All it would be able to do is just perform endless calculation.

01:00:18.464 --> 01:00:24.403
And yeah, that would be a computer I guess, I dunno.

01:01:14.929 --> 01:01:18.471
American Go players are very slow in the beginning.

01:01:18.611 --> 01:01:21.021
But this game they are fighting, so

01:01:21.171 --> 01:01:23.808
it's kind of a different style.

01:01:24.789 --> 01:01:26.291
Andy and Gansheng

01:01:26.425 --> 01:01:31.409
they're close to Korean style I think.

01:02:09.638 --> 01:02:11.422
I win by 10.

01:02:30.002 --> 01:02:34.140
No, Andy and I, we're been friends since 2000 maybe.

01:02:34.253 --> 01:02:36.162
We've known each other for 12 years.

01:02:36.296 --> 01:02:40.590
And we've been like, rivals, like you know, he went back to China sometime to learn Go,

01:02:40.711 --> 01:02:43.531
then I went back to China and we just kept on doing that.

01:02:43.662 --> 01:02:45.864
Andy doesn't care about the prize money. Andy cares about, like,

01:02:45.977 --> 01:02:48.875
his, like, theories and his thoughts.

01:02:49.003 --> 01:02:50.268
And that's like me too.

01:02:51.173 --> 01:02:53.737
The more I think about it, he's just not a normal person.

01:02:53.858 --> 01:02:56.284
- No, you need to be like that dude.
- To be good at Go, right?

01:02:56.393 --> 01:02:58.493
You can't just, like, study the game and be a normal person.

01:02:58.636 --> 01:03:01.236
I'm actually, I think I'm quite normal.

01:03:01.369 --> 01:03:02.938
- Do you know who's just a normal -
- Do you think I'm normal?

01:03:03.075 --> 01:03:04.904
- I don't know.
- Gansheng's pretty normal.

01:03:05.027 --> 01:03:08.611
Like he tries to hit on girls, he likes girls -

01:03:08.770 --> 01:03:10.888
- He wears a necklace.
- Whereas Andy, Andy, you know what...

01:03:11.036 --> 01:03:14.434
I don't think Andy likes girls. I think he...

01:03:14.565 --> 01:03:18.450
Maybe he does? I don't know. When you really ask him, he's like, "No, I dunno, I don't care, maybe I - "

01:03:18.587 --> 01:03:22.890
But Gansheng and I, we're clearly, like, almost exactly the same.

01:03:23.029 --> 01:03:26.047
We do a lot of shit the same. We think - our thoughts are the same.

01:03:26.176 --> 01:03:29.489
Like, you know, play Go, try our best, if we can't we lose,

01:03:29.638 --> 01:03:33.511
we go back to college, you know, have some fun with some girls,

01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:36.733
and then you know, study, get a maj - get a degree,

01:03:36.866 --> 01:03:38.514
and then, you know, start working, have a good life.

01:03:38.636 --> 01:03:41.147
That's, like, our thoughts. But like, I dunno about Ben,

01:03:41.282 --> 01:03:44.205
but Andy's thoughts are - he doesn't - it's all messed up.

01:03:44.346 --> 01:03:46.633
He doesn't know what he wants.

01:04:05.086 --> 01:04:07.345
Andy has managed to go undefeated

01:04:07.495 --> 01:04:09.802
in all of his games, all the way through.

01:04:09.931 --> 01:04:13.414
And so he is in the final best out of three,

01:04:13.537 --> 01:04:15.454
and he is up one game.

01:04:15.569 --> 01:04:17.775
So if he is to win this game,

01:04:17.886 --> 01:04:20.632
then he would be our first certified professional.

01:04:23.050 --> 01:04:26.512
One minute, please settle down and find your tables.

01:04:26.638 --> 01:04:28.336
One minute please.

01:04:28.516 --> 01:04:30.446
How much time do you use?

01:04:31.051 --> 01:04:32.933
- Fifty.
- Oh shit.

01:04:33.054 --> 01:04:36.411
I made Andy use more than 30 minutes.

01:05:09.491 --> 01:05:14.950
I think Gansheng Shi played much better this game.

01:05:17.736 --> 01:05:19.994
Andy, on the other hand

01:05:20.125 --> 01:05:22.354
played fast in the beginning

01:05:22.489 --> 01:05:25.894
so he made a few mistakes.

01:05:26.002 --> 01:05:28.828
Maybe he was too confident?

01:05:29.489 --> 01:05:34.732
Well it looks certainly like he's confident about what he's doing. He's playing so fast.

01:05:35.834 --> 01:05:38.875
This thing in the lower left corner blew my mind.

01:05:39.002 --> 01:05:42.872
And he's just, he's just, putting stones in everywhere.

01:05:43.856 --> 01:05:49.669
Isn't that just Andy's normal MO though? Just play fast, and super-confidently?

01:06:42.638 --> 01:06:48.168
The last thing I was able to see was Go.

01:06:48.296 --> 01:06:53.864
So Go is my last memory and final image.

01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:10.817
Not being able to see has made me concentrate more

01:07:10.929 --> 01:07:14.382
and read more thoroughly.

01:07:36.907 --> 01:07:40.052
The game is endless.

01:07:40.775 --> 01:07:44.289
I don't think human beings can ever master it.

01:07:56.027 --> 01:07:57.827
Andy appears to be irritated.

01:07:57.946 --> 01:08:03.164
Andy appears to have not foreseen what has begun to happen.

01:08:03.271 --> 01:08:07.171
If he connects those two stones, you're talking about here at Q12,

01:08:07.296 --> 01:08:11.497
Then that would be one big eye, and white would need to find another eye.

01:08:11.613 --> 01:08:18.073
I actually beat Andy in the New Jersey Open when he was 4 dan.

01:08:18.212 --> 01:08:19.563
So I actually have a win against him.

01:08:19.687 --> 01:08:22.167
So it will be kind of cool if he becomes the first pro

01:08:22.312 --> 01:08:26.608
and I can say, "Well, I'm 1 and 0 against him myself."

01:08:29.368 --> 01:08:30.671
He was very young.

01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:51.856
Is that group gonna die?

01:08:51.979 --> 01:08:55.023
Is that group gonna - that's what, I think he's...

01:09:06.319 --> 01:09:07.319
Good game.

01:09:09.736 --> 01:09:11.466
It's over, he resigned. It's over.

01:09:11.589 --> 01:09:12.587
Andy resigned.

01:09:14.368 --> 01:09:16.801
- He's dead!
- Oh he's dead.

01:09:16.934 --> 01:09:19.162
He's dead, it's a false eye.

01:09:19.807 --> 01:09:22.435
Oooh, those guys got cut off.

01:09:24.270 --> 01:09:26.464
Oh those guys are dead. Yeah, they were always -

01:09:26.609 --> 01:09:30.203
- Well, you were right. He had a chance to connect.
- Yeah.

01:09:32.785 --> 01:09:35.462
Yeah, those guys were always a target.

01:09:43.805 --> 01:09:46.671
Well, it's obviously 50-50 now, right?

01:09:47.442 --> 01:09:51.345
Who - whichever one of the takes the next game is the first pro.

01:09:53.393 --> 01:09:55.679
- Andy, what happened?
- I dunno.

01:09:58.902 --> 01:10:01.129
Let's take a look.

01:10:02.271 --> 01:10:04.208
You're so territorial.

01:10:05.029 --> 01:10:07.803
Like, territory everywhere.

01:10:17.026 --> 01:10:18.810
Yes. Yes!

01:10:20.078 --> 01:10:23.919
See? I told you. Andy's not that much stronger than us.

01:10:25.904 --> 01:10:27.514
Let's go eat.

01:10:44.171 --> 01:10:45.988
The average human lifespan is a bit short. 

01:10:46.109 --> 01:10:49.500
I would prefer to be living for, like maybe a few thousand years or so?

01:10:49.636 --> 01:10:55.688
Like, experience... like, that would be enough to learn a lot of things, like, that I would want to learn.

01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:02.682
I would prefer not to put myself in the thick of things

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:05.456
but just watch our evolution from...

01:11:07.538 --> 01:11:08.507
or...

01:11:10.489 --> 01:11:14.009
Ideally I would want to be blessed with a prodigious imagination

01:11:14.135 --> 01:11:18.311
and just create my own worlds in my mind.

01:11:19.255 --> 01:11:22.253
You would be the ruler of your own imaginary universe

01:11:22.381 --> 01:11:28.189
without actually, like, subjecting other people to your whims.

01:11:28.758 --> 01:11:31.718
As long as you don't feel stupid just living in your own imaginary world,

01:11:31.859 --> 01:11:34.362
it's pretty enticing.

01:11:40.709 --> 01:11:43.406
The game is so difficult

01:11:45.269 --> 01:11:49.392
only part of it has been conquered.

01:11:50.027 --> 01:11:54.563
When I sit in front of the board

01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:56.663
I fall completely into the game.

01:11:56.807 --> 01:12:00.241
When I am lost in my passion

01:12:00.367 --> 01:12:02.237
I have endless dreams...

01:12:04.688 --> 01:12:09.877
dreams of unbelievable moves

01:12:09.997 --> 01:12:16.639
that never occurred to me before.

01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:21.286
But once i reached a certain level

01:12:21.416 --> 01:12:22.953
the more I played

01:12:23.073 --> 01:12:25.793
the more I felt its difficulty.

01:12:26.856 --> 01:12:29.996
Even the best players in history

01:12:30.122 --> 01:12:33.232
their level is low

01:12:33.383 --> 01:12:35.403
in light of the game's sheer complexity.

01:12:38.707 --> 01:12:42.728
Many of the famous top players...

01:12:43.242 --> 01:12:45.686
they will sometimes sit at the board

01:12:45.804 --> 01:12:47.641
through the whole night.

01:12:48.709 --> 01:12:49.965
Just the empty board?

01:12:50.716 --> 01:12:51.883
Yes.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.380
They won't play,

01:12:53.513 --> 01:12:55.757
they won't read books,

01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:57.822
they just sit there and think.

01:13:04.220 --> 01:13:06.495
Ever since I was young

01:13:06.625 --> 01:13:11.103
I've been studying Go Seigen's games.

01:13:11.835 --> 01:13:15.519
It changes the way you play.

01:13:15.635 --> 01:13:20.225
After every move lies a world unknown.

01:13:21.098 --> 01:13:22.876
You are not Picasso or Monet

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.876
just because you imitate their paintings.

01:13:26.016 --> 01:13:27.762
Art is formed by

01:13:27.894 --> 01:13:29.859
putting your own color into something.

01:13:30.768 --> 01:13:35.078
A legendary player isn't just remembered for winning.

01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:39.697
They change the paradigms of the game.

01:13:40.342 --> 01:13:42.339
That's what I am striving to do too

01:13:42.484 --> 01:13:44.657
but I have a long way to go.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.658
More than forty years ago

01:13:49.782 --> 01:13:52.746
as computers were getting bigger

01:13:52.922 --> 01:13:55.859
a computer expert told me

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.499
that computers would become more and more powerful.

01:14:02.173 --> 01:14:07.058
But considering the amount of space on a 19x19 board

01:14:07.196 --> 01:14:09.527
wide as the universe

01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:13.950
if a computer manages to win

01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:16.701
many things will be different...

01:14:16.831 --> 01:14:19.306
the age we live in will have changed.

01:14:26.244 --> 01:14:27.889
Anyway, today's about you.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.335
Today's about you and how you're going to lose to Gansheng,

01:14:30.462 --> 01:14:32.080
make a bunch of excuses about it...

01:14:32.212 --> 01:14:34.849
I mean he played well against me, but

01:14:35.244 --> 01:14:37.570
can he repeat that every game?

01:14:38.929 --> 01:14:40.634
I dunno.

01:14:40.758 --> 01:14:42.643
It's in the bag.

01:15:06.118 --> 01:15:08.606
What are you guys thinking about the game?

01:15:08.714 --> 01:15:09.849
No idea.

01:15:10.008 --> 01:15:12.240
I encourage Gansheng...

01:15:12.372 --> 01:15:14.028
Beat him!

01:15:14.156 --> 01:15:16.749
He's gotta get that group out anyway,

01:15:16.881 --> 01:15:19.631
it's just a question of whether his other group is strong enough

01:15:19.773 --> 01:15:22.971
to get any type of double attack between the two white groups, right?

01:15:24.391 --> 01:15:28.424
Yeah. Well that's what this is - the last ten moves have been all about.

01:15:28.559 --> 01:15:31.764
Here, if black invades this white group doesn't have much territory.

01:15:31.901 --> 01:15:37.177
So I would say in this exchange, Andy has scored a minor victory.

01:16:13.299 --> 01:16:16.352
I'm getting... I'm getting scared Andy's going to over-attack again,

01:16:16.477 --> 01:16:19.057
and it's gonna bite him. I have no basis for this opinion.

01:16:19.194 --> 01:16:22.800
- He's gonna what?
- That's he's gonna over-attack again -

01:16:22.945 --> 01:16:26.206
and lose something like he did last game, yesterday.

01:16:30.124 --> 01:16:31.198
Oh boy.

01:16:31.325 --> 01:16:34.366
They're jostling for position in the middle.

01:16:34.512 --> 01:16:37.464
So now it's kind of like an arm-wrestling match in the middle.

01:16:37.590 --> 01:16:43.579
If - whoever pushes the other guy away is going to have a big advantage.

01:17:02.025 --> 01:17:04.621
White has won the arm-wrestling competition.

01:17:04.733 --> 01:17:08.365
He's kind of got black surrounded now.

01:17:08.491 --> 01:17:11.406
It seems like white scored a - Gansheng scored

01:17:11.554 --> 01:17:13.377
a very major victory in this fight.

01:17:13.528 --> 01:17:15.804
He's obviously completely enclosed now,

01:17:15.962 --> 01:17:19.908
but if he can survive the game is great for white.

01:17:27.460 --> 01:17:32.688
Black was quite prepared for that, threatening the double-atari on one side,

01:17:32.828 --> 01:17:35.623
and the two move capture on the other.

01:17:35.770 --> 01:17:37.864
Now Andy's thinking.

01:18:00.087 --> 01:18:04.277
There's been like three times when Andy's been all over the place confidence

01:18:04.429 --> 01:18:09.001
And the other guy has managed to throw a wrench into the works,

01:18:09.147 --> 01:18:11.213
but I think he's still OK.

01:18:16.677 --> 01:18:20.375
Of course. Gansheng tries to kill the entire group.

01:18:20.534 --> 01:18:22.350
This is extremely exciting!

01:18:22.497 --> 01:18:26.567
Now, black has no way to live - he has not enough eyes.

01:18:26.708 --> 01:18:29.357
Now the only thing he can do is he can push

01:18:29.506 --> 01:18:33.419
and cut off the middle white group and the corner white group,

01:18:33.591 --> 01:18:35.524
neither of which are alive either!

01:18:40.941 --> 01:18:43.832
This is a nasty race.

01:19:16.351 --> 01:19:22.036
Right now, Andy is definitely winning because Gansheng's middle group is dead.

01:19:22.181 --> 01:19:24.709
Oh man, this is terrible.

01:19:24.836 --> 01:19:28.615
I think Gansheng probably made a mistake in reading.

01:19:29.294 --> 01:19:30.766
Oh that's the end of the universe.

01:20:01.535 --> 01:20:03.191
Congratulations.

01:20:05.668 --> 01:20:07.551
Would you stand up?

01:20:09.129 --> 01:20:14.476
if you're still playing a game, please pause your clocks for a moment.

01:20:18.016 --> 01:20:21.692
Ladies and gentlemen, I am proud to present

01:20:21.813 --> 01:20:25.535
The first US-certified Go professional,

01:20:25.651 --> 01:20:28.623
Andy Liu.

01:20:44.490 --> 01:20:46.560
- Andy!
- Oh, professional!

01:20:46.768 --> 01:20:48.373
Oh Andy! You deserves...

01:20:48.512 --> 01:20:50.247
Liu sensei, Liu sensei

01:20:50.377 --> 01:20:53.670
Next time you should play teaching games!

01:21:12.767 --> 01:21:15.581
Gentlemen, please pause your clocks for one moment.

01:21:17.061 --> 01:21:19.412
I would like to present the second

01:21:19.573 --> 01:21:22.217
US-certified Go professional,

01:21:22.351 --> 01:21:24.995
Gansheng Shi.

01:21:32.399 --> 01:21:35.725
Will Andy Liu and Gansheng Shi please come up?

01:21:38.841 --> 01:21:42.079
These two emerged as the top of the heap

01:21:42.196 --> 01:21:49.087
and are achieving the first AGA certificates as professionals.

01:21:49.218 --> 01:21:53.874
And they deserve all our honor and respect.

01:21:53.993 --> 01:21:57.610
We have high hopes for their futures.

01:21:59.835 --> 01:22:03.689
Green tea, five different kinds of green tea.

01:22:03.813 --> 01:22:08.515
When you make these teas and drink these teas, you can remember this experience.

01:22:10.094 --> 01:22:16.333
So the AGA will send you to the five biggest tournaments in Korea.

01:22:16.467 --> 01:22:21.779
You are not just individual Go players anymore.

01:22:21.925 --> 01:22:25.226
You are representing the American Go Association as well

01:22:25.361 --> 01:22:28.862
and the American Go community as a whole.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:33.995
So if you become strong and hero

01:22:34.122 --> 01:22:36.079
and make a lot of money

01:22:36.213 --> 01:22:39.150
there will be thousands of kids

01:22:39.271 --> 01:22:42.094
who'd like to learn Go because of you.

01:22:42.233 --> 01:22:43.945
They want to be like you.

01:22:44.083 --> 01:22:49.187
We are just in the first step, and we'll keep going.

01:22:50.106 --> 01:22:53.810
It may seem like the same as it was a few days ago,

01:22:53.951 --> 01:22:56.990
but everything's changed.

01:23:00.445 --> 01:23:03.377
Apparently we get our own business cards.

01:23:04.490 --> 01:23:08.115
Yo where's Gansheng? Oh, right here.

01:23:09.113 --> 01:23:11.205
Did you get a - whoah, is that weed?

01:23:11.339 --> 01:23:13.450
- No, cha.
- Oh...

01:23:13.699 --> 01:23:18.208
BC Card, LG Cup, Samsung Cup, we're all invited.

01:23:18.354 --> 01:23:21.713
All invited? You don't even have to play in the...

01:23:21.858 --> 01:23:24.539
- Without precondition.
- The main tournament?!

01:23:24.670 --> 01:23:27.524
Out of 32 people there are going to be 2 Americans?

01:23:27.647 --> 01:23:30.159
- Yeah, they invite associations.
- Oh my God.

01:23:30.272 --> 01:23:32.673
And we get our own business cards.

01:23:33.647 --> 01:23:34.314
With the AGA.

01:23:34.422 --> 01:23:37.117
Oh my goodness dude, I don't know what to say.

01:23:37.241 --> 01:23:39.086
What was your question?

01:23:39.210 --> 01:23:42.583
Like what, when do you think you might go to Korea to play in these tournaments?

01:23:42.715 --> 01:23:45.028
I'm not sure.

01:23:46.193 --> 01:23:49.866
I'm actually... my attention

01:23:50.009 --> 01:23:53.008
is being taken away by this game.

01:24:19.542 --> 01:24:23.062
I'm not gonna leave a good thing in Korea.

01:24:23.181 --> 01:24:28.204
When I say it's a good thing, it's... as opposed to what?

01:24:29.677 --> 01:24:33.572
You get your one adventure, while you're still alive

01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:35.919
Like what the fuck else am I going to do?

01:24:36.045 --> 01:24:38.500
This is the thing that I'm best at.

01:24:38.641 --> 01:24:43.517
You take your talent to its full potential
and see where it goes, you know

01:24:45.632 --> 01:24:48.011
Factoring in all that, I just don't even care.

01:24:48.149 --> 01:24:50.217
Like OK, whatever, better, worse

01:24:50.339 --> 01:24:53.064
I have to live in a studio apartment for the rest of my life,

01:24:53.196 --> 01:24:56.004
that's not changing anything about the fact that

01:24:57.813 --> 01:25:01.169
everything's what you make it and like...

01:25:01.722 --> 01:25:04.346
treated my brain the way it wanted to be treated,

01:25:04.469 --> 01:25:07.522
did it what it was asking for, made myself happy

01:25:07.654 --> 01:25:12.128
as opposed to, like, lie to myself, and

01:25:12.250 --> 01:25:16.449
living in a suit that doesn't fit and like...

01:25:21.385 --> 01:25:24.437
I dunno, I'm kinda a little bit scared for him.

01:25:24.573 --> 01:25:32.124
Like he's not... he's not gonna thrive, he's not gonna survive in a corporate, like setting, I know that.

01:25:32.271 --> 01:25:38.773
Would he be OK if he, like, just spent the rest of his life, like,

01:25:40.219 --> 01:25:44.222
not as an outcast but as an unusual, like, member of society, like,

01:25:44.361 --> 01:25:46.409
just a like a...

01:25:50.196 --> 01:25:53.919
Neither of you fit into society very well.

01:25:54.060 --> 01:25:56.052
- Neither of us?
- Yeah.

01:25:56.474 --> 01:25:59.443
I think I have the ability to fit in.

01:26:00.332 --> 01:26:01.972
You do?

01:26:03.756 --> 01:26:04.701
OK.

01:26:04.835 --> 01:26:10.359
Like, I try to watch my stuttering, for example.

01:26:10.483 --> 01:26:15.521
The only reason I do that is because I look for...

01:26:15.655 --> 01:26:17.576
More precise words to describe myself.

01:26:17.722 --> 01:26:19.726
But that's not how most people speak.

01:26:19.858 --> 01:26:23.699
If you don't want to work, what are you gonna do?

01:26:23.835 --> 01:26:25.022
What do you mean?

01:26:25.151 --> 01:26:29.002
Well if you're not gonna go find some random job -

01:26:29.158 --> 01:26:31.008
I'm going to, just in time.

01:26:31.151 --> 01:26:34.611
Oh, so you are gonna?

01:26:34.745 --> 01:26:37.101
Yeah.

01:26:41.790 --> 01:26:45.201
OK, then.

01:26:45.925 --> 01:26:47.829
A job is important.

01:26:47.971 --> 01:26:49.917
I agree.

01:27:06.354 --> 01:27:08.332
Hi.

01:27:09.632 --> 01:27:10.833
So we have to find -

01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:12.206
So I think if we go downstairs

01:27:12.340 --> 01:27:15.304
there's gonna be more stores and we can get a cake.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.798
Yeah, I'd love to get a cake with a 99 on it.

01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:36.338
I was expecting rolling green hills, he lives on top of a mountain or something like that.

01:27:36.482 --> 01:27:37.585
Oh yeah, yeah.

01:27:41.106 --> 01:27:42.788
Hope he likes the cake.

01:27:52.179 --> 01:27:53.599
We will bring him in.

01:28:26.832 --> 01:28:29.430
It is close to your birthday

01:28:29.552 --> 01:28:31.749
on the old calendar.

01:28:31.881 --> 01:28:33.690
So we will have a birthday party.

01:28:39.309 --> 01:28:42.955
Happy birthday to you

01:28:43.111 --> 01:28:46.853
Happy birthday to you

01:28:46.993 --> 01:28:52.055
Happy birthday Go Seigen

01:28:52.174 --> 01:28:55.130
Happy birthday to you.

01:28:55.287 --> 01:28:56.321
Everyone together!

01:28:56.452 --> 01:28:58.943
One, two, three!

01:29:15.178 --> 01:29:18.092
This is strong.

01:29:19.700 --> 01:29:23.623
An amateur might cut here

01:29:23.745 --> 01:29:27.859
but this is the vital point.

01:29:27.993 --> 01:29:31.055
Even if you capture two stones

01:29:31.196 --> 01:29:35.332
it's no good!

01:29:37.038 --> 01:29:40.399
This is big.

01:29:41.655 --> 01:29:44.605
It's big.

01:29:48.399 --> 01:29:51.527
- What year?
- 1942.

01:29:54.196 --> 01:29:58.597
It was his first game of Jubango.

01:29:58.722 --> 01:30:07.173
I often played with Kitani sensei overnight.

01:30:12.542 --> 01:30:17.737
I would get tired when it was late

01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:21.320
but then I'd be more awake in the morning

01:30:21.445 --> 01:30:25.037
and catch up.

01:30:27.700 --> 01:30:30.899
We used to play pool

01:30:31.045 --> 01:30:34.823
near the Go center.

01:30:35.655 --> 01:30:41.929
Kitani would be taking off his glasses

01:30:42.083 --> 01:30:45.411
and it would take him

01:30:45.564 --> 01:30:47.638
five minutes

01:30:47.790 --> 01:30:50.033
to hit the ball.

01:30:50.181 --> 01:30:55.124
He was a good-hearted person.

01:31:07.151 --> 01:31:10.141
Once when I went

01:31:10.693 --> 01:31:16.421
to a temple in Kyoto

01:31:19.151 --> 01:31:24.749
I played an exceptionally good game.

01:31:31.851 --> 01:31:34.432
But with one move

01:31:34.722 --> 01:31:36.988
an atari

01:31:37.406 --> 01:31:41.216
the game was spoiled.

01:31:46.858 --> 01:31:50.802
Master Segoe and the priests

01:31:51.250 --> 01:31:53.084
were all disappointed.

01:31:56.084 --> 01:31:59.298
It was so close to perfect

01:31:59.445 --> 01:32:03.865
but that one atari...

01:32:24.293 --> 01:32:28.685
Go can bring happiness

01:32:28.790 --> 01:32:33.900
to people around the world.

01:32:34.061 --> 01:32:38.298
That is the best thing.

01:32:38.445 --> 01:32:43.615
I'm glad that I have played Go.

01:32:47.745 --> 01:32:49.015
He is tired.

01:33:18.903 --> 01:33:20.144
What are you thinking Andy?

01:33:20.290 --> 01:33:23.119
Wasting too much time on Go?

01:33:25.609 --> 01:33:27.684
- Me?
- Yeah.

01:33:28.933 --> 01:33:31.128
Probably, yes.

01:33:32.707 --> 01:33:34.969
I'm mean, I've envisioned myself

01:33:35.113 --> 01:33:37.166
doing other things instead of Go.

01:33:37.865 --> 01:33:40.661
Having not learned Go and...

01:33:41.745 --> 01:33:45.716
I think you can still do all of these things

01:33:46.460 --> 01:33:48.946
cause you're still very young.

01:33:49.095 --> 01:33:51.023
That's not true, I mean...

01:33:52.406 --> 01:33:54.582
The problem is that once you make the commitment,

01:33:54.707 --> 01:33:56.976
you're kinda, you're kinda...

01:33:57.609 --> 01:33:59.304
You're committed?

01:33:59.451 --> 01:34:01.381
You're kinda committed.

01:34:23.813 --> 01:34:27.184
Andy began working in the financial industry in New York

01:34:27.327 --> 01:34:30.569
and competing in professional tournaments in Asia.

01:34:33.653 --> 01:34:38.259
Ben returned to Seoul and continued to study Go there for another two years.

01:34:41.174 --> 01:34:46.320
Curtis decided to take a break from Go and started college at UC Berkeley.

01:34:58.845 --> 01:35:03.690
In 2016 the Go world was shocked by a breakthrough in artificial intelligence

01:35:03.844 --> 01:35:08.997
when top professional Lee Sedol was defeated for the first time by a computer program.
