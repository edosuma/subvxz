WEBVTT

01:03.521 --> 01:04.522
Bitch!

01:05.065 --> 01:07.192
You had to make it about her!

03:06.519 --> 03:07.979
They are good boys.

03:08.730 --> 03:10.398
They will do Rebecca proud.

03:11.316 --> 03:15.653
They keep asking where their father is.
They don't understand why he isn't here.

03:15.737 --> 03:17.155
What did you tell them?

03:17.238 --> 03:20.825
Well, I told them that he's
on a very important and sacred mission,

03:20.909 --> 03:23.203
that he loves them,
and he'll be home soon.

03:23.953 --> 03:26.206
Lemuel is very bright.

03:26.289 --> 03:28.458
I could do something with him.

03:28.541 --> 03:31.377
We will do
whatever both of them need.

03:32.086 --> 03:35.757
We owe it to Rebecca and to John.

03:36.549 --> 03:40.053
I made John that promise.
He understands.

03:42.013 --> 03:46.559
I know it bothers you,
but you can't protect John.

03:47.143 --> 03:48.561
It's gone too far.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.190
He can never come back.

03:53.316 --> 03:55.485
If they have us,
they don't need John.

03:55.568 --> 03:57.528
He can only bring them trouble now.

03:58.196 --> 03:59.822
He's damaged goods.

04:05.286 --> 04:09.582
You were always better
at making the hard choices.

04:10.792 --> 04:13.670
John's life will be the price
for those boys' future.

04:15.588 --> 04:16.881
And David's.

04:23.054 --> 04:25.098
Ah, David. To what do I owe the--

04:25.181 --> 04:26.224
Hi, Dad.

04:29.060 --> 04:30.311
Where is my son?

04:31.479 --> 04:34.065
I am asking you, where is my son?

04:34.148 --> 04:35.733
Yeah, I know what you asked me.

04:36.567 --> 04:37.568
Say hi, David.

04:39.904 --> 04:41.322
David, are you hurt?

04:42.282 --> 04:43.283
I'm fine.

04:43.366 --> 04:46.452
-If you touch one hair on his head--
-What is going on

04:47.036 --> 04:51.499
The psychopath that works for you,
he took the girl, so I took your son.

04:52.083 --> 04:53.293
If I don't get her back safely,

04:53.376 --> 04:56.045
you're gonna have a lot more to worry
about than the hair on his head.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.506
Threatening our son is the stupidest thing
you have ever done.

04:58.589 --> 05:00.842
-You have no idea what we're capable of.
-Anderson, easy.

05:00.925 --> 05:02.885
No, I know exactly what you're capable of.

05:03.886 --> 05:06.931
I know about the trail of bodies you left.
I know about Konchevsky,

05:07.015 --> 05:09.726
and I know about Poloznev
and the teenagers in Chicago.

05:09.809 --> 05:11.019
I know all about that.

05:11.686 --> 05:12.687
That's right.

05:13.813 --> 05:17.608
So think what we'll do to you
if you do not let our only child go.

05:18.276 --> 05:20.486
You will die slowly.

05:21.029 --> 05:25.158
I will kill everyone who so much as
crossed paths with you, Mr. Castle.

05:26.993 --> 05:29.620
-You threatening me?
-You need to calm down.

05:29.704 --> 05:32.540
That was more than a threat. It's a fact.

05:32.623 --> 05:34.250
I'm gonna see you dead.

05:34.959 --> 05:38.546
Nah... I think it was a threat.

05:41.382 --> 05:43.051
-David!

05:43.134 --> 05:44.052
Yeah.

05:45.053 --> 05:46.471
Your son is bleeding.

05:47.638 --> 05:48.848
That's a fact.

05:48.931 --> 05:49.849
I'm--

05:53.019 --> 05:55.063
You're quite something, Mr. Castle.

05:55.688 --> 05:58.399
But you're very much out of your depth.

05:58.483 --> 06:02.487
Look at that.
Mom's just as filthy as Dad, huh?

06:03.696 --> 06:07.158
What do you need
to deliver David back to us safely?

06:07.241 --> 06:10.078
I need the girl, and I need her unharmed.

06:10.661 --> 06:12.538
Once that happens,
you'll get your son back.

06:13.289 --> 06:14.916
How do I know I can trust you?

06:14.999 --> 06:16.834
You can reach me on David's phone.

06:17.585 --> 06:20.421
You trace it, you come after us, he dies.

06:23.174 --> 06:24.509
Is that a threat...

06:27.178 --> 06:28.304
or a fact?

06:29.222 --> 06:30.348
What do you think?

07:39.000 --> 07:40.626
Hey, Dad. It's Lemuel.

07:41.836 --> 07:44.088
It's so good to hear your voice.

07:44.881 --> 07:46.716
How are you

07:46.799 --> 07:47.925
We miss you.

07:48.676 --> 07:50.553
Oh, I miss you so much.

07:50.636 --> 07:52.054
When are you coming home?

07:52.597 --> 07:54.765
Mom's waiting for us at the funeral home.

07:56.934 --> 07:59.479
We're all gonna be together really soon.
I promise.

08:00.897 --> 08:03.983
I need you to look after your brother
until I get there, though, okay?

08:05.234 --> 08:06.652
You do that for Mama?

08:07.487 --> 08:08.488
Yes, sir.

08:08.571 --> 08:10.948
Yeah. I love you.

08:12.325 --> 08:13.826
Come, boys. Time for bed.

08:15.536 --> 08:16.370
Hello, John.

08:18.998 --> 08:21.876
We wanted you to remember
what you're fighting for.

08:24.420 --> 08:25.880
I don't need reminding.

08:26.547 --> 08:28.883
Frank Castle has kidnapped David.

08:29.675 --> 08:32.261
David was never meant to be part of this.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.972
Castle took him because you have the girl.

08:35.890 --> 08:37.892
Is the girl still alive, John?

08:40.102 --> 08:41.687
John, do you have the girl?

08:44.106 --> 08:45.233
Yeah, she's with me.

08:45.316 --> 08:46.317
Good.

08:47.568 --> 08:49.987
You have to do whatever it takes
to make David safe.

08:50.071 --> 08:54.075
You have only one path now, John,
but Michael and Lemuel have two.

08:56.285 --> 08:57.411
You understand?

08:58.829 --> 09:00.748
-I understand.
-Good.

09:01.624 --> 09:03.834
I have the number
where you should contact Castle.

09:03.918 --> 09:05.503
Are you ready to write it down?

09:17.265 --> 09:20.017
-Hey, hey. Calm down. Take it easy.
-Russo! Where is he?

09:20.101 --> 09:21.602
I don't know who you're talking about.

09:21.686 --> 09:23.145
-You need to calm down.
-Madani.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.898
Madani, calm down.
Let the woman help you, okay?

09:28.025 --> 09:29.026
Sit down.

09:30.027 --> 09:31.028
Sit down.

09:35.199 --> 09:37.785
I'll talk to you, all right?

09:39.579 --> 09:42.331
But you gotta promise
that you're going to the hospital.

09:46.210 --> 09:48.671
Yeah, okay. Okay.

09:49.255 --> 09:50.298
Give us a minute.

09:55.469 --> 09:57.930
He was here with the doctor
the whole time?

10:03.227 --> 10:04.312
Is she alive?

10:04.854 --> 10:07.607
Yeah, but she might wish she wasn't.

10:07.690 --> 10:10.943
Dr. Dumont looks like someone who got
thrown out of a third-story window.

10:13.779 --> 10:14.989
He was there.

10:15.072 --> 10:19.327
He was there after she fell,
bunch of flowers in his hand.

10:19.952 --> 10:22.163
And he came after me.

10:25.291 --> 10:28.044
I put three bullets in him,
and it was like it did nothing.

10:28.127 --> 10:29.378
How am I alive?

10:29.462 --> 10:31.964
-We'll talk about it later, Madani.
-No. How am I alive?

10:32.048 --> 10:34.592
-Please tell me.
-Okay, let... Okay. We got here...

10:34.675 --> 10:37.094
and you were lying on the floor
in a pool of blood.

10:37.178 --> 10:38.429
None of it your own.

10:39.263 --> 10:41.849
There's blood in the hallway,
down the stairwell.

10:43.434 --> 10:44.477
Russo didn't kill you,

10:44.560 --> 10:47.271
but I think maybe you killed him
and he just doesn't know it yet.

10:53.361 --> 10:54.487
I had him.

10:54.570 --> 10:55.571
Yeah.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.032
Shit. Look at you.

10:58.991 --> 11:01.577
All this for a guy
who's not even your case anymore.

11:03.829 --> 11:06.415
Taking out that guy
on the bridge, and now this.

11:07.375 --> 11:09.919
You trying to get back
in my good graces, Agent Madani?

11:10.878 --> 11:12.046
Is it working?

11:13.089 --> 11:15.007
Let's just say this whole
risking-your-life act

11:15.091 --> 11:16.801
makes it harder to come after you.

11:19.261 --> 11:22.932
Please, will you tell me
when you find him?

11:23.974 --> 11:24.975
I will.

11:28.604 --> 11:29.605
Thank you.

11:36.278 --> 11:37.488
I found these...

11:38.572 --> 11:39.615
on the floor.

11:40.366 --> 11:41.701
You might be needing them.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.416
I think I'm done with those.

12:06.517 --> 12:08.310
You know, I thought he had you.

12:08.394 --> 12:10.521
Been worried out of my goddamn mind.

12:10.604 --> 12:12.273
What were you thinking, coming here?

12:12.982 --> 12:14.692
That I'm sick of running from him.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.778
I just wanted to see where he lived.
I'm sorry.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.573
-It's room 630, down the hall.
-Jesus Christ.

12:23.075 --> 12:25.536
At least tell me that this is
the closest you got to him.

12:27.621 --> 12:29.832
Yeah. I found him and then I called you.

12:30.499 --> 12:31.500
All right.

12:32.334 --> 12:35.463
Whatever happens here, you just stay
out of the way. You understand me?

12:36.547 --> 12:37.715
Yeah. Okay.

12:42.344 --> 12:43.512
-Be careful.

12:43.596 --> 12:44.597
Yeah.

13:23.886 --> 13:26.305
-Go!
-Go, go!

13:54.792 --> 13:55.793
Go! Go!

14:30.077 --> 14:30.911
You done?

15:25.507 --> 15:27.968
-Go on, back up. Back up.

15:28.636 --> 15:32.222
Nope. Nope. Get back.

15:35.184 --> 15:37.436
Guess we both have something
the other wants, right?

15:37.519 --> 15:41.106
Yeah. Bring me David, she stays alive.

15:47.821 --> 15:50.199
Hit the down. Hit it!

15:52.952 --> 15:54.370
-I'm sorry.

15:55.329 --> 15:58.791
Expect my call.
Garage. Hit the garage. Do it.

15:59.416 --> 16:01.251
-Frank!
-You just do what he says.

16:01.335 --> 16:02.503
It's gonna be all right.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.340
-Damn it.

17:11.238 --> 17:12.906
-Frank!

17:52.112 --> 17:54.990
Hey, hey, hey!

17:55.074 --> 17:57.367
How about you leave that
till after we're done, huh?

17:58.660 --> 18:00.746
You want me to have a drink. Trust me.

18:08.128 --> 18:10.380
The gun ain't gonna do much good
for my nerves, either.

18:11.632 --> 18:13.092
You mind if I move this?

18:13.884 --> 18:14.718
Hmm?

18:22.476 --> 18:24.186
All right, just lie back.

18:24.269 --> 18:25.270
Just lie back.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.315
You lost a lot of blood.

18:28.398 --> 18:29.900
Yeah, no shit.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.569
They got ya good.

18:34.029 --> 18:37.658
Listen, man, there's a reason I'm here
and not Mount Sinai, okay?

18:37.741 --> 18:39.284
It ain't my bedside manner.

18:39.368 --> 18:40.744
I do flesh wounds.

18:40.828 --> 18:44.039
You know, fix up guys
that took a shot to the arm, the leg...

18:44.123 --> 18:46.792
you know, maybe need a few sutures
after a fight gone bad.

18:47.751 --> 18:49.586
But you should go to the hospital.

18:49.670 --> 18:52.381
They'll lock me back up.
Here's what's gonna happen.

18:52.464 --> 18:55.300
You're gonna pull out those bullets,
and you're gonna close me up.

18:55.384 --> 18:57.886
-Do you understand me?
-All right. All right.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.600
And I am not going under.

19:04.560 --> 19:07.688
I have to. No matter how much
of a badass you think you are,

19:07.771 --> 19:10.274
you're gonna flinch, and I'm gonna take
two inches off your liver.

19:10.357 --> 19:12.693
I said no.

19:17.739 --> 19:19.283
-Let's go!
-Yeah.

19:27.374 --> 19:29.042
Yeah. Yeah.

19:39.636 --> 19:42.014
-This is stupid.
-Get it out!

19:43.640 --> 19:45.100
We got one.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.186
-Okay.
-One.

19:47.269 --> 19:49.605
Let's get this shit out.
Let's go! Let's go!

20:21.970 --> 20:23.555
I didn't want any of this.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.309
I know the feeling.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.688
They didn't deny it. Any of it.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.318
All this time, and I... I never...

20:37.027 --> 20:40.072
How could I not know?

20:40.155 --> 20:40.989
How--

20:42.366 --> 20:44.409
How could I not sense it?

20:46.662 --> 20:48.497
You were their poster boy, David.

20:49.581 --> 20:51.250
They wanted to keep you clean.

20:51.875 --> 20:55.587
Plausible deniability.
Isn't that what the spooks call it?

20:56.129 --> 20:58.340
I didn't ask for any deniability.

20:58.423 --> 21:01.969
And now people are dead
because of some photographs?

21:03.011 --> 21:05.180
It was what was in those photographs.

21:06.014 --> 21:07.307
It isn't relevant.

21:08.183 --> 21:09.851
It shouldn't be, you're right...

21:10.519 --> 21:12.729
but some people don't think like that.

21:13.313 --> 21:15.148
My parents being some of them.

21:17.109 --> 21:19.152
From what I know...

21:20.028 --> 21:22.614
...no offense,
but you got some shitty parents.

21:24.658 --> 21:26.535
My mother always said that

21:26.618 --> 21:29.413
we needed to protect people
from their own prejudices.

21:32.374 --> 21:37.754
It was the price of getting me
where I wanted to be to do the most good.

21:41.717 --> 21:43.802
But now I wonder if maybe...

21:46.013 --> 21:48.390
my parents had
all these people murdered...

21:51.268 --> 21:53.020
simply because they...

21:55.647 --> 21:57.316
they were ashamed of me.

21:59.651 --> 22:04.573
Didn't want anything about me...
hurting their legacy.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.953
That's all they really cared about.

22:15.292 --> 22:17.836
You don't seem like him. Castle.

22:20.547 --> 22:23.842
Why are you doing this?
Holding me hostage.

22:25.469 --> 22:27.346
Is this you, or...

22:29.514 --> 22:30.682
who you wanna be?

22:31.558 --> 22:33.852
I started out
just wanting to do the right thing.

22:35.145 --> 22:36.605
Now, I just want to go home.

22:36.688 --> 22:38.565
Yeah.

22:40.567 --> 22:41.985
You and me both.

24:04.484 --> 24:05.861
Curt?

24:39.561 --> 24:40.645
Yeah?

24:41.521 --> 24:42.898
How do we do this?

24:44.941 --> 24:47.402
Well, he's here. The trailer.

24:47.986 --> 24:49.571
You want him, you come get him.

24:52.032 --> 24:53.783
Ah, shit.

24:57.829 --> 24:59.122
Okay, Frank.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.459
Jesus Christ.

25:03.919 --> 25:06.463
You're really planning
on going after him in this state?

25:07.881 --> 25:09.883
You're crazy. He's gonna kill you.

25:10.258 --> 25:12.177
Yeah... maybe.

25:13.011 --> 25:14.554
Or I'll kill him.

25:17.224 --> 25:19.976
God will decide which of us is righteous.

25:20.060 --> 25:21.686
You honestly believe that?

25:22.979 --> 25:24.356
He's the Punisher.

25:24.439 --> 25:28.527
He's gonna, like, righteously pull
your spine out of your throat.

25:35.700 --> 25:37.911
What was righteous about all this, anyway?

25:39.704 --> 25:41.915
What happened to "Thou shalt not kill"?

25:44.125 --> 25:45.669
I mean, come on, you...

25:45.752 --> 25:48.630
you murdered people
who never hurt anybody.

25:48.713 --> 25:50.090
They're using you.

25:53.552 --> 25:55.387
Just because someone says
something is true

25:55.470 --> 25:56.555
doesn't mean that it is.

25:57.681 --> 25:59.641
Even if you wanna believe them.

26:01.184 --> 26:03.228
Even if you keep believing them.

26:05.063 --> 26:07.107
Even if they believe it themselves.

26:09.568 --> 26:13.822
In the end, you just have to admit that
they're lying and change your own path,

26:13.905 --> 26:17.409
'cause... people never change.

26:19.911 --> 26:22.831
They just hide stuff from you
and let you down.

26:23.498 --> 26:25.542
Over and over again.

26:28.378 --> 26:30.505
Plenty of kids learn that at a young age.

26:33.300 --> 26:35.468
And so you have to decide...

26:36.553 --> 26:40.890
do I stay,
or do I change the path for myself?

26:48.023 --> 26:49.482
You could still change this.

26:51.568 --> 26:53.111
It's too late.

26:53.194 --> 26:54.529
It doesn't have to be.

26:56.531 --> 26:59.618
Let me go. Walk away.

27:00.952 --> 27:02.579
I wish I could.

27:08.752 --> 27:10.337
I really wish I could.

27:40.283 --> 27:41.284
Detective.

27:46.498 --> 27:48.458
Last time I saw you, Mr. Hoyle...

27:51.002 --> 27:55.006
you had a rifle... pointed at my head.

27:56.341 --> 27:58.218
-I'm sorry about that.
-You should be.

27:58.301 --> 28:00.303
-Where's Frank Castle?
-I don't know.

28:01.054 --> 28:03.348
But what I do know
is this shit needs to end.

28:04.557 --> 28:05.850
That's why I'm here.

28:06.393 --> 28:07.644
That's why he's here.

28:11.398 --> 28:12.732
Senator Schultz?

28:15.944 --> 28:17.904
Interesting company you're keeping.

28:19.072 --> 28:20.323
Are you all right?

28:20.407 --> 28:22.909
All things considered,
I've been treated very well.

28:23.493 --> 28:24.786
Castle kidnapped him.

28:24.869 --> 28:26.538
Solving a crime no one knew about.

28:26.621 --> 28:27.914
Impressive.

28:27.997 --> 28:29.958
What does the senator
have to do with Billy Russo?

28:30.041 --> 28:30.917
Nothing.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.085
Then, what?

28:32.627 --> 28:34.963
I don't know. I just...

28:35.046 --> 28:36.464
Just giving him back.

28:37.340 --> 28:39.217
Senator, do you want me
to arrest this man?

28:39.300 --> 28:40.427
No, I don't.

28:41.136 --> 28:44.097
He's just trying to fix
someone else's mistakes.

28:44.180 --> 28:45.598
And for what it's worth, Officer,

28:45.682 --> 28:48.893
I think that Curtis is just trying
to find a way to do the right thing.

28:51.396 --> 28:56.568
The last few days, I've learned nothing is
easy or simple where Castle is concerned.

28:58.153 --> 29:00.029
I checked you out, Hoyle.

29:00.113 --> 29:01.740
Everyone says you're a good guy.

29:01.823 --> 29:04.743
So long as you never point a gun
at another cop again...

29:05.744 --> 29:07.120
you get a pass.

29:07.203 --> 29:08.329
This time.

29:10.331 --> 29:12.333
Come on, Senator. I'm taking you home.

29:15.044 --> 29:17.630
And, Curtis, I advise you the same.

29:18.590 --> 29:20.341
There's nothing I'd rather do more.

29:54.751 --> 29:55.960
Go ahead and close it.

30:01.758 --> 30:02.675
You okay?

30:03.384 --> 30:06.304
I want you to get on your knees. Go ahead.

30:12.644 --> 30:13.937
David's in the trailer.

30:14.896 --> 30:16.564
A pound of C-4 strapped to his head.

30:16.648 --> 30:19.484
I press the send button on this phone,
we paint the walls with him.

30:22.487 --> 30:24.155
You keep on coming, don't you?

30:26.491 --> 30:28.159
So what is it with you? What's--

30:30.870 --> 30:31.871
You sick?

30:33.206 --> 30:34.707
You some kind of maniac?

30:36.292 --> 30:37.585
Or do you owe 'em something?

30:39.337 --> 30:41.506
More like something they owe me.

30:41.589 --> 30:44.968
Nah, this thing's gone too far.
You're gonna end up a loose end.

30:45.593 --> 30:47.387
What, you think you can trust them?

30:50.056 --> 30:51.724
They have my sons.

30:59.774 --> 31:02.527
I understand you didn't have
a chance to save your kids.

31:03.528 --> 31:04.529
Yeah, that's right.

31:07.949 --> 31:09.868
If you had, what would you have done?

31:12.704 --> 31:13.913
I'd have done anything.

31:16.583 --> 31:17.959
Here we are.

31:20.044 --> 31:21.129
Here we are.

31:27.385 --> 31:28.553
So you, uh...

31:29.387 --> 31:30.597
you got a name?

31:33.057 --> 31:34.017
John.

31:34.100 --> 31:36.477
Okay, John. Here's the thing.

31:37.228 --> 31:41.232
That kid right there...
the one whose head you got that gun on,

31:41.316 --> 31:43.151
you see, I'd do anything for her.

31:43.985 --> 31:44.986
Anything.

31:46.988 --> 31:50.617
So I want you to take that weapon...
you point it at me.

31:51.868 --> 31:53.244
Come on, just point it at me.

31:53.912 --> 31:54.913
I'm unarmed.

31:59.417 --> 32:00.627
Let her go, John.

32:02.170 --> 32:03.254
What are you gonna do here?

32:03.338 --> 32:05.423
You gonna kill another kid

32:22.941 --> 32:24.233
Let her go.

32:25.485 --> 32:26.861
Come on.

32:28.404 --> 32:29.864
Frank.

32:29.948 --> 32:33.618
Okay. Hey, hey, you're okay.
Listen to me. You gotta walk away.

32:33.701 --> 32:34.869
Frank, don't do this.

32:34.953 --> 32:36.371
-Walk away. Hey...
-Don't do this.

32:36.454 --> 32:37.288
Stop it.

32:37.372 --> 32:40.291
You walk away. You go get in that car,
and you drive to the end of the road.

32:40.375 --> 32:43.002
You hit the horn when you get there.
You hear me? Go now.

32:43.086 --> 32:44.087
Hey...

32:45.088 --> 32:46.506
Go.

32:48.675 --> 32:49.676
Go.

33:26.754 --> 33:28.172
Give me the phone.

33:31.634 --> 33:32.885
Here's the thing, John.

33:34.846 --> 33:36.180
David's not in there.

33:43.938 --> 33:45.023
Then, where is he?

33:45.106 --> 33:46.315
I don't know.

33:46.899 --> 33:48.151
Oh, you don't know?

33:49.318 --> 33:51.154
-Where is he?
-I don't know, John.

34:09.714 --> 34:11.090
Shit.

34:40.369 --> 34:41.454
Where is he?

34:46.834 --> 34:48.461
Where is he

35:49.188 --> 35:50.398
You need a minute?

35:52.525 --> 35:53.818
I was waiting on you.

37:21.697 --> 37:22.657
Wait.

37:26.410 --> 37:28.120
When you kill them...

37:30.456 --> 37:32.041
don't hurt my boys.

37:39.757 --> 37:41.133
I know who you are.

37:46.681 --> 37:48.140
You're the whirlwind.

38:28.597 --> 38:29.598
Hello?

38:31.767 --> 38:32.768
Curtis...

38:34.061 --> 38:35.563
Curtis...

38:37.398 --> 38:38.441
I'm hurt.

38:40.526 --> 38:42.069
I'm hurt really bad.

38:43.112 --> 38:44.155
Where are you?

38:45.281 --> 38:47.491
Yeah, I'm bleeding all over your basement.

38:53.289 --> 38:54.332
I'm dying.

38:56.459 --> 38:57.543
I'm dying, Curt.

38:59.337 --> 39:00.379
Will you come?

39:12.433 --> 39:15.394
Can you promise me that...
that you won't call the cops, at least?

39:15.478 --> 39:16.771
Can you do that?

39:18.356 --> 39:19.565
Can you do that?

39:22.860 --> 39:24.779
I promise I won't call the cops.

39:30.576 --> 39:33.996
Look, I know that I probably
don't deserve it after what I've done...

39:37.375 --> 39:40.711
but if you can find it in yourself
to be a brother one last time...

39:47.051 --> 39:48.469
I don't want to die alone.

39:51.055 --> 39:53.432
I don't want...

39:54.392 --> 39:56.394
I don't...

40:16.705 --> 40:18.207
Did you come here to gloat?

40:18.874 --> 40:19.875
No.

40:22.336 --> 40:24.547
No, I'm sorry this happened to you.

40:25.131 --> 40:26.132
Which part?

40:27.591 --> 40:29.718
The throwing me out of a window?

40:30.302 --> 40:32.179
Billy dragging you into this.

40:34.306 --> 40:36.058
He didn't drag me into anything.

40:39.186 --> 40:40.229
I love him.

40:46.986 --> 40:48.404
Is he alive?

40:53.367 --> 40:54.827
Yeah, as far as I know.

40:59.957 --> 41:02.626
He ran. He left you bleeding in the dirt.

41:02.710 --> 41:05.212
He was no use to me if he stayed.

41:06.338 --> 41:07.465
He knew that.

41:08.799 --> 41:10.843
He knew I would have
wanted him to be free.

41:15.347 --> 41:17.057
You know, you were right, kinda.

41:20.186 --> 41:22.771
I really did get the therapy
I needed at your place.

41:22.855 --> 41:27.109
Not the talking so much, but when I
finally put three bullets in Billy,

41:27.193 --> 41:29.111
that really helped my state of mind.

41:31.071 --> 41:32.406
You see this blood?

41:36.702 --> 41:37.828
It's his.

41:43.626 --> 41:49.131
You see, he is on the street...
alone, bleeding.

41:53.260 --> 41:57.014
Now the only question is
whether we'll find him alive or dead.

41:59.934 --> 42:01.185
He won't die.

42:03.229 --> 42:04.438
He's too strong.

42:06.607 --> 42:08.067
And he's gonna come for me.

42:09.818 --> 42:12.154
When the time is right,
he's gonna come for me.

42:15.908 --> 42:17.576
I'll let you know when we find him.

42:19.703 --> 42:21.872
He'll kill you for what you did to me.

42:25.459 --> 42:27.086
Oh, you did this to yourself.

42:42.893 --> 42:44.061
Curt?

42:45.354 --> 42:46.605
Curtis, here!

42:48.774 --> 42:51.193
I knew you'd come, and...

42:55.072 --> 42:56.156
Frankie.

43:05.332 --> 43:06.458
You don't look so good.

43:12.047 --> 43:13.257
Of course it's you.

43:15.092 --> 43:16.218
I should have known.

43:20.681 --> 43:22.558
If I'm gonna be with somebody, I'm...

43:24.852 --> 43:26.312
I'm happy that it's you.

43:31.900 --> 43:32.901
Frank...

43:34.820 --> 43:36.488
whatever I've done, I'm--

44:12.274 --> 44:14.485
Any chance we can preserve
the crime scene?

44:16.070 --> 44:17.946
What part of this isn't clear to you?

44:18.781 --> 44:20.324
Only who fired the bullets.

44:21.158 --> 44:22.826
Tell me how it went again?

44:22.910 --> 44:25.371
Billy called me. Then I called you.

44:25.454 --> 44:28.290
That's right. Because you're done
being involved with Frank.

44:30.459 --> 44:32.044
Mahoney, does it really matter?

44:32.127 --> 44:35.172
I guess I'm still not used
to blurring the lines as much as you.

44:40.552 --> 44:41.637
Was this you?

44:42.763 --> 44:43.806
Madani...

44:44.932 --> 44:46.475
did you finish the job?

44:46.558 --> 44:49.186
I'm flattered, really.

44:55.067 --> 44:56.860
But you know what? Yeah, maybe...

44:58.862 --> 44:59.905
maybe I did.

44:59.988 --> 45:03.075
Maybe I put five bullets in him
instead of three.

45:06.537 --> 45:08.539
And then that's the end of the story.

45:11.417 --> 45:12.418
Case closed.

45:14.503 --> 45:15.796
And what about Castle?

45:20.134 --> 45:21.176
Who?

45:24.805 --> 45:27.725
Son of a bitch.

45:39.194 --> 45:40.487
David is strong-willed.

45:40.571 --> 45:42.197
He's liable to say something stupid,

45:42.281 --> 45:44.450
speak out,
make some sort of grand gesture.

45:44.533 --> 45:48.328
I'm headed to New York tomorrow.
David will listen to me.

45:48.412 --> 45:50.247
But you've gotta deal with John.

45:50.956 --> 45:54.209
Eliza, he has done everything
that we have asked of him.

45:54.293 --> 45:56.336
We've already talked about this.

45:56.420 --> 45:59.006
Just someone else
for you to kill and toss aside?

46:00.007 --> 46:01.175
Move and I'll shoot.

46:03.510 --> 46:04.595
No one's coming.

46:05.429 --> 46:06.847
I gave them the night off.

46:07.806 --> 46:10.517
Maybe I should have just killed them
like you would've.

46:11.935 --> 46:14.521
What do you want We can do that.

46:15.439 --> 46:18.692
Girl... move that gun away from my wife.

46:24.948 --> 46:26.408
How does it feel?

46:30.078 --> 46:31.997
You killed all my friends.

46:32.581 --> 46:33.707
I told you...

46:34.875 --> 46:37.544
to move the gun away from my wife!

46:37.628 --> 46:38.670
Get down!

46:41.089 --> 46:43.175
Eliza!

46:50.224 --> 46:52.392
You okay -Yeah.

46:52.476 --> 46:55.187
Goddamn murdering bastard!

46:57.773 --> 46:58.607
Yeah.

46:59.066 --> 47:03.237
I was gonna come in here
with two bullets, give you a choice.

47:03.987 --> 47:06.073
Looks like your bitch wife made hers.

47:08.742 --> 47:10.285
Now it's your turn.

47:11.245 --> 47:12.746
John said you were dead.

47:15.624 --> 47:17.000
I know about Konchevsky,

47:17.084 --> 47:19.336
and I know about Poloznev
and the teenagers in Chicago.

47:19.419 --> 47:20.712
I know all about it.

47:20.796 --> 47:21.964
That's right.

47:22.047 --> 47:25.968
So think what we'll do to you
if you do not let our only child go.

47:26.593 --> 47:28.846
You will die slowly.

47:28.929 --> 47:33.350
I will kill everyone who so much
as crossed paths with you, Mr. Castle.

47:35.686 --> 47:37.646
Money. Power.

47:38.856 --> 47:41.358
I think all you care about is your name,

47:41.441 --> 47:44.611
carving it into the world
so deep that it never fades.

47:46.405 --> 47:48.156
Somehow, out of all this bullshit,

47:48.240 --> 47:52.077
that son of yours, he's got decency,
he cares about the world, about people.

47:52.160 --> 47:54.788
He knows right from wrong. How is that?

47:56.290 --> 47:58.500
Give David a chance
at making things right...

48:00.002 --> 48:03.046
or else, in 24 hours, I'm gonna walk
into the office of the New York Bulletin

48:03.130 --> 48:05.757
with this tape and the photographs
and start talking.

48:16.643 --> 48:19.563
Time for you to make a choice.

48:23.275 --> 48:26.695
You take that gun.
You stick it in your mouth.

48:26.778 --> 48:28.530
You blow out the back of your head.

48:31.783 --> 48:33.035
Or you live.

48:35.662 --> 48:37.080
But you live with the truth.

49:30.676 --> 49:32.761
All airport shuttles are available

49:32.844 --> 49:34.596
on the main level of the terminal.

49:34.680 --> 49:35.764
Last chance.

49:38.016 --> 49:39.518
-We're good together.

49:40.519 --> 49:41.603
You're a kid.

49:42.813 --> 49:43.897
Go act like one.

49:44.773 --> 49:46.608
I can't have you on my conscience.

49:48.568 --> 49:51.947
I'm sorry, are...
are you saying that you care?

49:52.030 --> 49:53.365
Yeah...

49:54.491 --> 49:56.994
-I think you're a boil on my ass.

49:57.077 --> 49:59.746
A big one. One that just won't go away.

49:59.830 --> 50:02.457
Yeah, I once put a stitch or two
in your butt.

50:02.541 --> 50:03.583
Yes, you did.

50:07.087 --> 50:09.464
Well, I... I care about you, too.

50:11.133 --> 50:14.469
I mean, I owe you...
pretty much everything.

50:19.850 --> 50:22.978
You know, all this time, though,
I did wonder why...

50:24.396 --> 50:26.982
why did you come after me
in the bar that night?

50:29.234 --> 50:30.318
"Rough Road."

50:32.946 --> 50:36.116
Uh, it's...
It's what you called me, remember?

50:37.200 --> 50:40.620
Rough Road. I don't know, I...
I thought it was funny.

50:40.704 --> 50:41.705
Hmm.

50:43.874 --> 50:47.794
Yeah, it was like the tougher you acted,
the more scared you looked.

50:55.969 --> 50:59.514
You know, all this shit that's gone down,
you gotta get past it.

51:01.266 --> 51:03.226
You move on, live your life right.

51:04.978 --> 51:07.481
No more of this
con artist blackmail bullshit.

51:07.564 --> 51:09.399
You gotta give me your word on that.

51:17.365 --> 51:18.825
I want you to take that.

51:18.909 --> 51:19.951
Go on, take it.

51:20.494 --> 51:21.536
Put it away.

51:24.164 --> 51:26.166
That should take care of you for a bit.

51:28.210 --> 51:29.878
When you get down to Florida...

51:33.131 --> 51:35.050
I want you to call this number. Yeah?

51:36.009 --> 51:38.970
Buddy of Curtis and mine.
He runs a dive school.

51:39.554 --> 51:41.973
He's a good guy. He'll take care of you.

51:43.934 --> 51:45.018
He told you.

51:45.852 --> 51:46.853
Yeah.

51:48.230 --> 51:51.316
Hidden treasure, huh?

51:51.399 --> 51:52.400
Christ.

51:58.365 --> 51:59.533
That's your bus.

52:02.828 --> 52:03.912
You know, kid...

52:05.914 --> 52:06.957
sometimes...

52:10.085 --> 52:12.295
you find things and, uh...

52:14.923 --> 52:16.133
they change your life.

53:55.273 --> 53:56.858
How'd you find me, Madani?

53:56.942 --> 53:58.401
I'm with the CIA now, Frank.

53:59.986 --> 54:01.154
I can find anything.

54:01.988 --> 54:03.323
What do you want?

54:03.406 --> 54:06.660
I've got a very bad man
with a target on his back.

54:07.244 --> 54:08.703
Needs a good man to take the shot.

54:09.412 --> 54:12.916
So what happened

54:12.999 --> 54:15.377
I guess I spent too much time
with you, huh?

54:16.127 --> 54:18.296
We need good people here
to get things done.

54:19.005 --> 54:20.382
And let's face it...

54:21.174 --> 54:24.928
when it comes to this stuff...
you're the best.

54:27.847 --> 54:29.724
I'm offering you a job, Castle.

54:29.808 --> 54:31.768
I already got a job, Madani.

54:32.602 --> 54:33.728
You take care.

54:55.959 --> 54:58.753
So you want to make an offer?
I'm listening.

54:58.837 --> 55:02.799
But it needs to involve you handing it
over to us and just walking away.

55:02.882 --> 55:05.510
When you called this sit-down,
I thought you were ready to see sense.

55:05.593 --> 55:07.637
Come on, man.
I didn't call this bullshit. You did.

55:07.721 --> 55:09.848
What are you smoking? I didn't call...

55:09.931 --> 55:11.933
Oh, you wanna dance

55:12.475 --> 55:13.476
Hey!

55:15.937 --> 55:17.022
I'll dance with ya.
