On June 5, 2018,
I took a six-man team

on a special-purpose
extraction mission

00:59.660 --> 01:02.261
to an opium factory

a combatant at the door
was alerted to our presence.

02:02.423 --> 02:05.791
There were plastic sheets
hanging from the ceiling,
obscuring the hall.

The mission for this
covert operation relied
on aggressive action and speed.

and blew the fuck
out of everything,

02:52.940 --> 02:55.874

Steven Paulson.

03:54.235 --> 03:56.501

[Torres] <i> Yes, sir.</i>

03:56.503 --> 03:58.937

04:51.759 --> 04:55.093
I can make a few phone calls.
I didn't sign up

04:55.095 --> 04:57.162
That's the wrong metric
to measure what we do.

04:58.932 --> 05:00.198

So, Johnson...
We're not gonna do this again,
are we, Bene?

15:36.236 --> 15:39.203
We are, we are.
We're gonna do it until
I can wrap my brain around it.

15:39.205 --> 15:42.206
So Dad's a politician
with serious swagger.

15:43.276 --> 15:46.144
Self-made.
Catholic and proud.

15:46.146 --> 15:48.079
Mom's a mom.
A good Jewish mom.

15:48.081 --> 15:49.714
Great Jewish mom.

15:49.716 --> 15:51.950
Great.
A Jew and a Catholic?
Fuck me.

15:53.286 --> 15:54.886
I know. Crazy, right?

15:54.888 --> 15:57.722
The guilt trips
must've been off the charts.

15:57.724 --> 15:59.390
I guess Mom had
to be a frickin' 12

15:59.392 --> 16:02.160
to get the attention
of our rich blue blood
from Boston.

16:02.162 --> 16:04.462
-[sighs]
-So, uh...

16:06.066 --> 16:07.732
Mom meets Dad,

16:07.734 --> 16:10.401
Dad dips his wick
in the Galilee, and...

16:10.403 --> 16:12.637
-We're gonna do this? Really?
-...along comes you.

16:12.639 --> 16:15.173
Silver spoon.
Private school. Limousine.

16:15.175 --> 16:17.508
And I'm sure you banged
your share of the sweet

16:17.510 --> 16:21.079
Ivy League pussy on your way
to graduating cum laude
from MIT.

16:21.081 --> 16:23.014
That's magna cum laude.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.217
"Magna cum-for-brains"
is more like it.

16:27.921 --> 16:30.088
Who gives all that up
to make Aliyah

16:30.090 --> 16:32.056
and fly jets for Israel.

16:32.926 --> 16:34.692
It's just the law
of return, right?

16:34.694 --> 16:36.027
Over a Sabra girl?

16:38.698 --> 16:40.698
You know what?

16:42.435 --> 16:44.702
She is a good girl.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.704
Good.
Good girl.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.873
She must feed you
as good as she fucks you.

16:48.875 --> 16:52.110
No. No, man.
See, that's the thing.

16:52.112 --> 16:54.779
She feeds me
better than she fucks me.

16:54.781 --> 16:58.449
All this talk of your
smoking-hot mom and perfect
wife is giving me a hard-on.

16:58.451 --> 16:59.817
You want to talk
about my mom?
Oh, yeah.

16:59.819 --> 17:01.419
Don't do it. You hear me?

17:02.522 --> 17:04.389
Over the top!

17:04.391 --> 17:05.923
Do you want to fly

Hey, Gunny, I thought
this was meant to be
a cushy training gig.

17:16.302 --> 17:18.369
What the fuck, boss?
Surely we're too good

17:18.371 --> 17:20.671
for this "two weeks in the shit,
prep us for war" stuff.

17:20.673 --> 17:22.907
Training never ends,
Sergeant Fuckface.

17:22.909 --> 17:26.077
-That's what I thought
you'd say. Thank you.
-I was looking forward to

17:26.079 --> 17:29.213

out there in Tel Aviv!

17:29.215 --> 17:32.016
I heard them Israeli girls,

17:32.018 --> 17:34.819
they love them
a little bit of chocolate,
you know what I'm sayin'?

17:34.821 --> 17:38.089
Johnson, you're so fucking
pretty, all the Israeli girls
are gonna love you.

17:38.091 --> 17:40.224
-And their fucking brothers too.
-[all exclaiming]

Ooh, la, la, la, la, la, la.

17:46.232 --> 17:48.232
Hey, Reza, how many languages
you speak now?

17:48.234 --> 17:51.602
Let me see.
Uh, English, Arabic,

17:51.604 --> 17:55.273
Farsi, Kurdish, French,
and a little Pashto.

17:55.275 --> 17:58.709
Oh, you don't
speak Spanish?
Nah. But my cock does.

Okay, that's
a good thing, huh?

18:00.713 --> 18:04.048

18:04.050 --> 18:07.285
Hey, Gunny, what'd he say?
He call me fuckface? Sarge!

18:07.287 --> 18:09.787
Sarge, what'd he say?
Did he call me fuckface?

18:09.789 --> 18:11.456
You are a fuckface.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.791
Hey, Johnson,
I'll fuck your face.

18:13.793 --> 18:15.860
Your face is
so fucking pretty,

18:15.862 --> 18:19.897
I'd fuck it in the night,
I'd fuck it in the morning,
I'd fuck it at dinnertime.

18:19.899 --> 18:22.233
I wake up in the morning,
I'd fuck it again.
I'd flip your face over

18:22.235 --> 18:24.936
and shave it,
put a beard back on,
then I'll fuck it again.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.671

You're missing
my birthday again.

19:28.701 --> 19:31.969

We'll celebrate when I get back.

29:03.676 --> 29:05.876
<i> His army is small</i>

29:05.878 --> 29:08.112
<i> We pinpoint</i>
<i> his location,</i>

29:08.114 --> 29:10.180
and then we lose him.

29:10.182 --> 29:12.449
He stays in the shadows,

29:12.451 --> 29:14.218
moves in the night.

29:14.220 --> 29:17.755
He has a direct line
to Assad,

29:17.757 --> 29:19.790
Nasralleh and Rouhani,

29:19.792 --> 29:22.626
and gets financing
from all three.

29:22.628 --> 29:25.863
<i> We think he had a hand</i>
<i> in the chemical attacks</i>

29:25.865 --> 29:27.865
at Aleppo and Ghouta.

29:27.867 --> 29:30.134

-Yes.

29:30.136 --> 29:33.637
<i> He's 100 percent committed</i>
<i> to avoiding detection.</i>

Can we get
gunships in there
with an extraction unit?

32:06.725 --> 32:09.493
He'd see us coming
and kill Major Jackson
before we could get to him.

32:11.697 --> 32:14.798
May I suggest a special ops
covert operation?

32:14.800 --> 32:17.768
General Betz,
this is Neta Luria,

32:17.770 --> 32:18.869
Israeli Intelligence.

32:21.106 --> 32:24.775
-Mossad.
-Specializing in, uh,

32:24.777 --> 32:27.311
covert operations
and counterterrorism.

32:27.313 --> 32:31.481
We need to scramble
an extraction team.

32:31.483 --> 32:34.618
<i>We have a tight window</i>
<i>before Major Jackson winds up</i>
<i>in Assad's hands--</i>

32:34.620 --> 32:38.088
or worse yet,
gets ferried over to
the streets of South Beirut.

32:38.090 --> 32:40.123
What's the window?

32:40.125 --> 32:43.293
Intelligence puts it
at 36 hours, max.

32:43.295 --> 32:45.495
Thirty-six hours to--
Never seeing him alive.

32:49.335 --> 32:51.401
We'll be negotiating
for a dead body.

32:54.473 --> 32:57.908
This is Benghazi
all over again.

32:57.910 --> 33:01.712
I can't think
of all the ways
this is fucked!

33:03.916 --> 33:06.283
Have you any idea
what would happen
if Assad found out

33:06.285 --> 33:09.786
<i> he had the son</i>
<i> of a United States senator</i>
<i> captive?</i>

33:09.788 --> 33:12.289
I'll scramble a team.

33:12.291 --> 33:16.760
Marine Corps
Special Operations Command
wants this.

33:16.762 --> 33:20.597
-MARSOC?
-Due respect--
he's one of ours.

33:20.599 --> 33:22.966
[Betz] <i> He's the son</i>
<i> of a US senator.</i>

33:22.968 --> 33:26.103
Yes, General Betz,
I'm aware,

33:26.105 --> 33:29.773
but Ronan Jackson
made Ailyah
five years ago,

33:29.775 --> 33:31.641
and he's now
an Israeli.

33:31.643 --> 33:34.111
-Law of return.
-Exactly.

33:34.113 --> 33:36.947
<i> Your senator's son</i>
<i> is one of us now.</i>

33:36.949 --> 33:38.949
The Second Marine Raiders

33:38.951 --> 33:41.518
are on exfil exercises
with Shaldag
in the Golan Heights.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.820
I know.
I signed the paperwork.

33:43.822 --> 33:46.990
Well, I suggest we send them
into Daraa Province now.

33:46.992 --> 33:51.161
An IDF-MARSOC joint op...
it's never been done.

33:51.163 --> 33:52.963
There's a first time
for everything.

33:52.965 --> 33:56.666
Shaldag is the best in the world
at this kind of work.

33:56.668 --> 33:59.703
Due respect, we don't need
the Marine Corps' help.

33:59.705 --> 34:03.140
[Betz]
<i> Why do I get the feeling</i>
<i> when you say "due respect,"</i>

34:03.142 --> 34:07.144
I'm being talked to
like I was a cocktail waitress
in Hooters?

34:08.514 --> 34:10.647
I don't care if you think

34:10.649 --> 34:12.482
<i> you need the Marines</i>
<i> or not.</i>

34:14.153 --> 34:16.753
The four stars
on this jacket say...

34:18.257 --> 34:21.391
Second Marine Raiders
are on this op,

34:21.393 --> 34:24.761
<i> with or without Shaldag.</i>

34:26.331 --> 34:27.631
Due respect.

34:36.875 --> 34:39.409
-[man] What is it they call you?
-Sergeant Razor.

34:39.411 --> 34:42.079
This is a nickname,
yes?

34:42.081 --> 34:45.048
Yeah.
They call me Reza.

34:45.050 --> 34:46.917
I gave him
the nickname Razor

34:46.919 --> 34:49.786
'cause he cuts
through the bullshit
like a motherfucking razor.

34:49.788 --> 34:52.122
[man]
Then they should call you
Sergeant Gillette.

34:52.124 --> 34:55.292
-Oh. Funny guy.
-I want a nickname.

34:55.294 --> 34:58.929
You have one: Malka.

34:58.931 --> 35:00.764
Yo, what does
Malka mean?

35:00.766 --> 35:04.234
-Malka means "queen"
in Hebrew.
-Dude! Dude!

35:04.236 --> 35:05.969
"Queen" fucking rocks, man!

35:05.971 --> 35:07.938
Whoa, whoa.
Listen, listen.

35:07.940 --> 35:10.774
There are three rules
for nicknames. One:
It will be assigned to you.

35:10.776 --> 35:12.776
Two: You won't like
that shit.

35:12.778 --> 35:15.912
And three: If you bitch
about rules one and two,

35:15.914 --> 35:18.882
you're gonna get a nickname
even worse than the one
you bitched about.

35:36.802 --> 35:38.034
Hey.

35:40.005 --> 35:43.006
The world just changed.
Changed how?

35:43.008 --> 35:45.942
You and your combined units
are on Task Force Judah now.

35:45.944 --> 35:48.678
Operation Get Back.
Yes, sir.

35:48.680 --> 35:51.281
You and these
Second Marine Raiders
head out now.

35:51.283 --> 35:53.917
It's a joint exfil op.

35:53.919 --> 35:56.086
Insertion and extraction.

35:56.088 --> 35:58.488
MOSSAD's going
outside of the fence
on this one with you.

35:58.490 --> 36:01.491
This is Neta Luria.
She will help you
with the intel.

36:01.493 --> 36:03.994
Consider yourself
briefed.

36:03.996 --> 36:07.664
There's no time to prep
on life-sized models
of the target.

36:07.666 --> 36:09.799
This is a time-sensitive
mission,

36:09.801 --> 36:12.269
so we're sacrificing prep
for speed.

36:12.271 --> 36:14.538
<i> Yalla. </i> Let's go.

36:14.540 --> 36:15.772
<i>Yalla.</i>

36:15.774 --> 36:17.374
[speaking Hebrew]

36:24.383 --> 36:28.351
-Let's go.
-We'll work all three
operational spheres.

36:28.353 --> 36:30.220
Getting to the destination,

36:30.222 --> 36:33.557
working at the destination,
and returning home.

36:33.559 --> 36:37.827
A Hermes 450-UAS
is shadowing us
for the next 36 hours,

36:37.829 --> 36:40.397
giving us
real-time snapshots
of the battlefield.

36:40.399 --> 36:42.165
What's the package?

36:42.167 --> 36:45.468
An IDF fighter pilot downed
outside of Daraa prov in Syria.

36:45.470 --> 36:47.971
Wait.
This is a live op?

36:47.973 --> 36:50.707
I don't show up
for anything that involves
dum-dum bullets.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.342
[Torres]
What are we doing
on this mission?

36:52.344 --> 36:54.844
It's an Israeli pilot.
Makes it an Israeli problem.

36:54.846 --> 36:58.481
The pilot's American-born.
Son of a US senator.

36:58.483 --> 37:01.017
Listen, I've been
on these ops before.

37:01.019 --> 37:03.520
Lots of them.
They're all dicey as fuck.
I get that.

37:03.522 --> 37:06.856
But I'm responsible
for my guys, and I lost one
last time out,

37:06.858 --> 37:10.660
so I'm asking, do you
have any concrete data
where the package is?

37:10.662 --> 37:13.897
Or is this a hunt-and-peck?
A little of both,
Gunnery Sergeant.

37:13.899 --> 37:16.366
That's the best I have
right now.

37:16.368 --> 37:19.836
-What the fuck is this beast?
-[Luria] On-field command post.

37:19.838 --> 37:22.606
This shit looks like
it was built by Lego.
[men laughing]

37:22.608 --> 37:25.208
So let me guess.

37:25.210 --> 37:27.677
-This is your ride, right?
-Mm-hmm.

37:27.679 --> 37:29.379
So you get
all the armor,

37:29.381 --> 37:31.548
And we go in...

37:31.550 --> 37:33.950
with no doors,
no windscreen?

37:33.952 --> 37:37.053
Yeah. But you got
the big guns.

37:37.055 --> 37:39.889
Sergeant Namjoo,

37:39.891 --> 37:43.793
your MARSA file says
you're fluent in Arabic
in the Levantine dialect.

37:43.795 --> 37:47.130
Yes, ma'am.
But you should hear
my Spanish.

37:47.132 --> 37:49.065
[men laughing]

37:49.067 --> 37:51.034
[man] Inside joke.

37:51.036 --> 37:53.803
You're riding
in the lead truck with me.

37:53.805 --> 37:56.573
Suggest you remove
name tags and ranks.

37:56.575 --> 37:59.109
This ain't our first time
swinging at the piñata, lady.

38:00.879 --> 38:03.046
What is the plan?

38:03.048 --> 38:05.749
-Get to the border
and hold for the intel.
-Okay.

38:05.751 --> 38:09.152
[foreign language]

38:09.154 --> 38:11.321
You're a lead
on this op, Five?

38:11.323 --> 38:14.991
Yes, of course.
And if it was my call,
you'd stay here.

38:14.993 --> 38:16.893
This isn't your war.

38:16.895 --> 38:19.429
We've got no choice.

38:19.431 --> 38:22.899
Israel was born in war
and sustained
by the threat of war.

38:22.901 --> 38:24.701
This is between
the Israelis and Arabs.

38:26.672 --> 38:30.240
Afghanistan, Iraq,
Bosnia, Horn of Africa--

38:30.242 --> 38:33.610
None of them are my wars,
but I've been fighting them
since I graduated high school.

38:33.612 --> 38:35.178
How's that working out
for you?

38:39.818 --> 38:42.018

next to me?

No helmet on, minimum gear,
thousand-yard stare.

39:12.551 --> 39:15.285
I mean, what is this,
fucking nursery school 101?

39:15.287 --> 39:18.655
-Yeah, he's old-school
on reserve.
-Does he talk?

39:18.657 --> 39:21.558
Ask him how is it
to be a Yemenite.
Maybe he will answer.

39:21.560 --> 39:24.160
I told you, I'm Yemen
from the waist down only.

39:24.162 --> 39:26.529
-That's a good thing?
-It's a very good thing.

39:26.531 --> 39:28.998
-Oh, you mean he's hung.
-[all chuckling]

39:29.000 --> 39:30.400
Something like that, yeah.

39:30.402 --> 39:32.869
I guess that makes me
a Yemenite too, huh?

39:35.374 --> 39:37.240
I fucking love
Americans.

39:37.242 --> 39:39.609
I got a hand cannon.
I'll show you later.

39:40.746 --> 39:42.278
He's seen it.
Johnson's seen it.

We pooled a team
of our best men.

39:58.230 --> 40:00.497
That doesn't answer
my question.

40:00.499 --> 40:03.266
We think your son
is still alive, Senator,

40:03.268 --> 40:05.835
but he was taken captive
by the Golan Freedom Brigade.

40:05.837 --> 40:08.671
We think.
Have they made contact?
Any demands?

40:08.673 --> 40:10.106
Not yet.

40:10.108 --> 40:12.208
All right, I need
a no-b.s. assessment.

How far on the other side
of the border fence?

41:17.342 --> 41:19.676
[Luria]
We drive due east from here
about 45 minutes,

41:19.678 --> 41:21.911
and we'll get to a building
on the outskirts of al-Hrak.

41:21.913 --> 41:23.646
That's the short route.

41:23.648 --> 41:25.815
The short route
is always dangerous.

41:25.817 --> 41:28.284
North Command Control
is running this op.

41:28.286 --> 41:30.587
Are we staging here?

41:30.589 --> 41:32.856
They want us to shelter
in place until nightfall.

41:32.858 --> 41:35.625
Too much enemy
out there now.

41:35.627 --> 41:37.360
What kind of enemy?

41:37.362 --> 41:39.128
You know.

41:39.130 --> 41:41.297
Joker. Dr. Doom. Magneto.

41:41.299 --> 41:44.701
Oh. Oh, you got jokes.
Real funny guy.

41:44.703 --> 41:47.170
-[chuckles]
-You forgot Green Goblin.

41:47.172 --> 41:49.772
Jabhat Al-Nusra,
ISIS, SAA.

41:49.774 --> 41:53.142
-The usual suspects.
-Night instead of day.

41:53.144 --> 41:55.979
They'll be gunning for us

they're pinned on speed.

-Yeah. Got me through college.

I want you to promise me.

42:11.329 --> 42:14.697
I don't know what shakshouka is.
I'm guessing it's breakfast,
and I love breakfast.

42:14.699 --> 42:17.500
But I've spent a lot of time
down-range from these fuckers,

42:17.502 --> 42:19.135
and getting back
is never so easy.

42:20.238 --> 42:21.938
So let's focus
on getting in.

42:43.662 --> 42:45.094
F-16 pilot.

42:46.531 --> 42:48.298

At least one of these names
is correct.

43:29.741 --> 43:32.375
"To Ronan, with love.
Dad.

43:32.377 --> 43:34.277
Semper Fi."

43:34.279 --> 43:36.412
Who is your father?

43:36.414 --> 43:38.181
My father?

43:39.451 --> 43:41.651
My father's name
is Roey Hollander.

43:43.254 --> 43:45.221
What is your rank?

43:45.223 --> 43:47.790
I'm a lieutenant.
I'm a second lieutenant.

43:49.094 --> 43:51.060
Second lieutenant.

43:51.062 --> 43:52.929
Ronan...

43:52.931 --> 43:55.665
Your rank,
or I will hurt you.

43:55.667 --> 43:57.333
I'm a general.

43:59.170 --> 44:00.737
[groans]

44:00.739 --> 44:03.573
You speak with
an American accent. Why?

44:05.577 --> 44:07.010
What is your rank?

44:08.613 --> 44:09.646
Lieutenant.

44:11.683 --> 44:13.950
You're too old
to be active.

44:13.952 --> 44:16.152
Now, are you
a reserve pilot?

44:16.154 --> 44:18.087
No, I'm not too old.

44:18.089 --> 44:19.956
A major, maybe?

44:19.958 --> 44:22.125
Or a lieutenant colonel?

44:22.127 --> 44:23.760
I've just graduated
from cadet school.

44:26.665 --> 44:30.833
"To Ronan,
with love, Dad.

44:30.835 --> 44:32.835
Semper Fi"!

44:38.643 --> 44:40.376
You will break.

44:40.378 --> 44:42.378
Everyone breaks.

44:43.982 --> 44:45.381
Good luck.

45:36.034 --> 45:39.235
[Five] <i> We sweep the first</i>
<i>hundred meters of the road.</i>

45:39.237 --> 45:42.071
<i> IUDs, HIMs,</i>
<i> land lines, whatever.</i>

45:43.575 --> 45:45.174
Roger that.
Let's get to it.

45:46.678 --> 45:48.511
Let's go.

45:54.352 --> 45:56.652
[goats bleating]

46:10.268 --> 46:12.969
-You ready for this, Big Time?
-This is my American nickname?

46:12.971 --> 46:14.036
That's right.

46:15.306 --> 46:16.606
Why Big Time?

46:16.608 --> 46:18.975
You're one
motherfucking badass.

46:20.979 --> 46:24.213
Big Time. I like it
better than Queen.

46:25.984 --> 46:28.618
It's all yours, brother.
I hope it sticks.

46:28.620 --> 46:32.388
-Why wouldn't it stick?
-Sometimes nicknames
don't stick.

46:32.390 --> 46:34.924
How would I know?

46:34.926 --> 46:37.860
If Gunny uses it,
that means it stuck.

46:49.107 --> 46:50.973
Are you married?

46:52.010 --> 46:53.276
Yeah.

46:53.278 --> 46:54.544
What is her name?

46:55.814 --> 46:57.146
Noa.

46:57.148 --> 46:58.581
Do you have
any children?

47:03.254 --> 47:04.887
We're expecting our first.

47:06.791 --> 47:08.391
Thank you for that.

47:10.461 --> 47:12.428
But you will never
see her again.

47:14.165 --> 47:17.466
And you will never
see your child

47:17.468 --> 47:19.635
come to life.

47:19.637 --> 47:22.471
I am the last person
you will ever see.

47:22.473 --> 47:24.073
[chuckling]

47:30.048 --> 47:31.681
It's just that...

47:32.650 --> 47:34.050
you're wearing a mask.

47:37.555 --> 47:39.689
[foreign language]

47:46.331 --> 47:48.164
Look at this face.

47:48.166 --> 47:51.667
This is the face
of war.

47:51.669 --> 47:53.870
The war
that will not end

47:53.872 --> 47:57.406
until we see
the end of Zionism.

47:58.643 --> 47:59.642
Well...

48:01.079 --> 48:02.578
good luck with that.

48:08.152 --> 48:10.853
Wait a second. Wait a second.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

48:10.855 --> 48:13.656
Wait. Hey. [exclaims]

48:15.226 --> 48:16.959
[crying out]

48:27.872 --> 48:29.705
[foreign language]

48:29.707 --> 48:31.274
[coughing, gasping]

48:37.448 --> 48:41.183
You're strong,
and you were trained.

48:41.185 --> 48:43.352
I can respect that.

48:43.354 --> 48:45.721
Your government,

48:45.723 --> 48:49.625
with its Western allies,
poisoned the world against us.

48:49.627 --> 48:52.929
The world order
must be reset.

48:52.931 --> 48:54.931
My government will not
negotiate with you.

48:54.933 --> 48:57.033
But they will come
for you.

48:58.303 --> 49:00.303
You're like a candle

49:00.305 --> 49:04.040
whose only purpose
is to burn out

49:04.042 --> 49:06.475
and to be extinguished

49:06.477 --> 49:08.978
to shed light
for the benefit
of others.

49:08.980 --> 49:12.648
That is the only reason
you were sent to me.

49:12.650 --> 49:14.283
You can have your fun.

49:16.054 --> 49:19.755
You can break me,
but you're not gonna
fucking win!

49:19.757 --> 49:23.793
Who... is... Dad?
[cries out]

49:45.083 --> 49:46.048
Wait here.

49:53.591 --> 49:55.291
Hello, Avigail.

49:55.293 --> 49:57.326
Senator Jackson.

49:58.096 --> 49:59.228
Come in.

50:12.543 --> 50:16.145
Do those casualty officers
have to stand outside the door?

50:16.147 --> 50:19.915
They're here
to keep you informed
and take care of your needs.

50:21.953 --> 50:23.519
I need my husband back.

50:27.225 --> 50:28.958
Can I get you
something to drink?

50:28.960 --> 50:30.292
Sure.

50:33.331 --> 50:35.765
Sweet tea,
with ice and lemon.

50:44.742 --> 50:47.309
Let me help you
with that, Avigail.

50:47.311 --> 50:49.612
Here, here.
Let me help you with that.

50:51.816 --> 50:53.816
I'm such a klutz.

50:53.818 --> 50:57.186
Watch yourself.
Ronan teases me
all the time.

50:57.188 --> 50:59.422
We were just on vacation
last night.

51:05.163 --> 51:06.429
[sobbing]

51:13.738 --> 51:14.937
Come here.

51:42.767 --> 51:45.000
[indistinct conversations]

52:23.474 --> 52:25.441
Hey, guys.

52:25.443 --> 52:27.476
All clear.
Let's get out--

52:30.781 --> 52:32.448
Got a man down.

52:32.450 --> 52:33.983
Contact.
Unknown position.

52:33.985 --> 52:36.986
We got a sniper at 11:00, but
I can't see the motherfucker.

52:38.422 --> 52:40.856
Judah 1-6 to North Command.
We have a man down.

52:40.858 --> 52:43.292
<i> I repeat:</i>
<i> We have a man down. Over.</i>

52:43.294 --> 52:46.095
-You got eyes on him?
-We gotta move, we gotta move.

52:46.097 --> 52:47.229
Cover fire! Cover fire!

52:56.641 --> 52:59.241
-Anyone got eyes
on the shooter?
-Negative.

53:07.985 --> 53:10.953
-Nothing on glass! [shouts]
-Gunfire! Lieutenant--

53:16.394 --> 53:18.894
Judah 1-6,
what's going on
out there?

53:18.896 --> 53:21.564
-It's Pardo.
-How's he doing, Razor?

53:21.566 --> 53:24.333
-He's fucked up bad, sir.
-What's the status?

53:24.335 --> 53:26.735
He's dead, sir.
Pardo's dead.

53:26.737 --> 53:28.037
Fuck!

53:31.075 --> 53:34.343
I've got a goat herder,
700 meter, at my 11:00.

53:34.345 --> 53:37.713
-You see him, Five?
-Positive. Got him on glass.

53:37.715 --> 53:39.748
No shot!
Shooter's out of range!

53:40.918 --> 53:42.651
Cover fire!

53:44.755 --> 53:46.989
We've got to get closer!
Let's go!

53:59.503 --> 54:01.237
[panting] Fuck!

54:05.876 --> 54:07.610
We're still not close enough.

54:10.348 --> 54:11.480
We're close enough.

54:35.573 --> 54:39.074
No plan survives
first contact.

54:39.076 --> 54:42.411
There is no perfect version
of this kind of operation.

54:42.413 --> 54:45.381
We haven't met.
Ellis R. Betz,

54:45.383 --> 54:48.817
commanding general,
US Military Central Command.

54:48.819 --> 54:51.153
Abiram Yairi,
major general, North Command.

54:51.155 --> 54:53.122
That's Lieutenant
Colonel Mizrah

54:53.124 --> 54:55.958
from Unit 5101 out of
Palmachim Air Base.

54:55.960 --> 54:59.728
Our comms team
activated the cruise systems
and jammed the cell towers

54:59.730 --> 55:03.666
and pinged every
cell signal in the area
surrounding the sniper.

55:03.668 --> 55:06.135
Did they pick up
any radio chatter,

55:06.137 --> 55:08.304
cell phone traffic?
No.

55:08.306 --> 55:10.239
Mission is definitely
compromised.

55:11.575 --> 55:13.309
Do we send 'em or not?

55:14.745 --> 55:17.479
Well, I can't speak
for the Shaldag,

55:17.481 --> 55:19.748
but I can for my boys.

55:19.750 --> 55:21.450
Send in the Raiders.

55:21.452 --> 55:23.152
Yes, sir.
Copy that.

55:29.260 --> 55:31.827
North Command Control
wants us to leave him here.

55:31.829 --> 55:34.797
The team is a minute out
to pick up the body
and close the gate.

55:34.799 --> 55:36.598
Mission Get Back
is in effect.

55:38.002 --> 55:39.601
Load 'em up.

55:57.321 --> 55:59.088
[engine starts]

56:31.055 --> 56:32.755
Hey.

56:32.757 --> 56:34.089
You okay?

56:36.494 --> 56:38.093
Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

56:49.006 --> 56:50.439
How far along are you?

56:51.609 --> 56:53.008
Twelve weeks.

56:53.010 --> 56:55.411
Do you know
if it's a boy or a girl?

56:55.413 --> 56:57.279
A boy.

57:07.291 --> 57:09.625
I wasn't really there for him
as a young man.

57:14.098 --> 57:17.900
Ronan is the strongest,
most beautiful man
I've ever known.

57:17.902 --> 57:20.669
He got that
from someplace.

57:31.048 --> 57:32.915
Tell me!

57:32.917 --> 57:36.285
Who... is... Dad?

57:43.661 --> 57:45.427
You take a lot of notes,
Gunnery Sergeant.

57:45.429 --> 57:49.565
Yeah. Helps to clear my head
from all the noise.

57:49.567 --> 57:53.235
-What are you writing?
-It's a note to my daughter.

57:53.237 --> 57:57.306
-How old?
-Sixteen tomorrow.

57:57.308 --> 58:00.042
I drove my father crazy
when I was 16.

58:01.612 --> 58:04.079
-Tough age.
-Yeah, that's what I hear.

58:39.316 --> 58:41.550
We're on foot
from here.

58:41.552 --> 58:43.986
Johnson, Malaku,
over-watch.

58:43.988 --> 58:46.121
We'll search
in teams of three.

58:46.123 --> 58:48.891
Man, woman, child,
everyone is here
to kill us.

58:48.893 --> 58:52.361
Use your discretion.
Assemble on me.

59:35.839 --> 59:37.973
Switch your helmet cams on
and your safeties off.

59:40.244 --> 59:42.077
Switching on helmet cam.
Rolling live.

1:00:14.311 --> 1:00:16.211
[man exclaims, groans]

1:01:16.040 --> 1:01:18.040

1:01:52.476 --> 1:01:54.109
[whispers] Go, go, go!

1:02:06.590 --> 1:02:08.123
[Five] Switch on
your white light.

1:02:10.894 --> 1:02:12.227
Go!

1:02:17.234 --> 1:02:19.067
North Command,
we've got breach.

1:02:20.270 --> 1:02:21.470
Clear.

1:02:31.548 --> 1:02:33.148
[Five]
They're on the right.

1:02:50.868 --> 1:02:53.268
Got hostiles coming
at our two, Big Time.

1:02:53.270 --> 1:02:55.103
You are not
cleared hot.

1:02:55.105 --> 1:02:57.472
I repeat,
you are not cleared hot.

1:02:57.474 --> 1:02:59.808
[Johnson] Copy that.
Holding scope.

1:03:02.079 --> 1:03:05.614
[Five] Strike team has
breached, and we are moving
towards the package.

[Luria] <i> SAA soldiers</i>
<i> are gathering to your east.</i>

1:03:11.555 --> 1:03:14.723
-Can you buy us some time?
-Not without getting
in a gunfight.

1:03:14.725 --> 1:03:16.458
[Five]
Do what you can, 1-6.

1:03:17.761 --> 1:03:19.227
[Johnson] Clear.

1:03:21.632 --> 1:03:22.831
Fuck!

1:03:36.814 --> 1:03:39.681
-It's like
a fucking maze in here.
-Same shit, different day.

1:03:39.683 --> 1:03:41.917
You should split.
Spread the risk.

1:03:41.919 --> 1:03:43.251
Torres...

1:03:48.292 --> 1:03:50.325
Sharhabi, Brener.

1:03:50.327 --> 1:03:52.027
All right.

1:04:00.137 --> 1:04:02.737
[groans, screams]

1:04:06.176 --> 1:04:08.343

Ask him where
the pilot is.

1:04:39.309 --> 1:04:40.709
[Five] Door. Right.

1:04:46.750 --> 1:04:49.251
Clear.

1:04:49.253 --> 1:04:52.053
Sharhabi, stay on the door.
Brener, come with me.

1:05:01.899 --> 1:05:03.899
1-6, we've reached
the package.

1:05:03.901 --> 1:05:06.167
-Is he alive?
-Checking.

1:05:09.606 --> 1:05:11.072
Hey, Jackson?

1:05:12.342 --> 1:05:13.575
Hey, Ronan Jackson?

1:05:17.514 --> 1:05:19.414
We need a positive ID.

1:05:19.416 --> 1:05:21.283
North Command needs
positive ID.

1:05:21.285 --> 1:05:23.952
Roger that.
Working on the ID.

1:05:23.954 --> 1:05:25.754
Hey, Jackson.

1:05:33.897 --> 1:05:36.331
1-7, this is 1-6.
What's your status?

1:05:38.101 --> 1:05:40.035
<i> I repeat,</i>
<i> what's your status? Over.</i>

1:05:51.081 --> 1:05:53.214
Razor, check him out.

1:05:55.552 --> 1:05:58.920
Hey, now, you okay?
Sharhabi, look at me.

1:05:58.922 --> 1:06:00.388
Are you okay?

1:06:00.390 --> 1:06:02.157
Jesus! Fucking nails.

1:06:04.494 --> 1:06:05.794
[Torres] Oh, fuck.

1:06:14.905 --> 1:06:17.005
1-6, this is 1-8.

1:06:17.007 --> 1:06:21.009
-Brodetsky and Brener
are dead. Over.
-Get out of there now, 1-8.

<i> This was an ambush.</i>
<i> We'll pick you up</i>
<i> at the main entrance.</i>

out of here.

1:06:25.949 --> 1:06:27.382
What a fucking mess.

You fucking idiot.
Let's stay on mission.

-You want me to pull them?
-I'll tell you what I want.

1:06:35.425 --> 1:06:39.194
I want your blue team
to get me a precise location
for our fucking pilot!

huh, buddy?
-Yeah.

-[man screams]
-Come on!

1:08:06.917 --> 1:08:10.018
-Gunny, status? Over.
-All good.

1:08:10.020 --> 1:08:11.286
Run like a motherfucker!

1:08:38.215 --> 1:08:39.347
RPG!
Get down!

1:08:51.128 --> 1:08:52.360
[groaning]

1:09:04.141 --> 1:09:05.807
[shouts, indistinct]

1:09:11.314 --> 1:09:14.215
Benedetti?
Johnson, cover me!

1:09:21.191 --> 1:09:23.658
Let's get him the hell
out of here, now!

1:09:23.660 --> 1:09:25.860
-[groans]
-Go! Let's go!

1:09:34.671 --> 1:09:37.405
-Hey, fuckface.
-[coughs]

1:09:39.543 --> 1:09:41.142
Hey, Gunny,

1:09:41.144 --> 1:09:43.845
tell my wife
I'll be okay.

1:09:45.148 --> 1:09:47.749
[men shouting]

1:09:49.786 --> 1:09:52.854
-We need to get
the hell out of here!
-Go!

1:09:53.823 --> 1:09:55.423
[shouting]

1:10:05.235 --> 1:10:06.734
Go, go, go!

1:10:29.593 --> 1:10:31.626
[phone rings]

1:10:42.339 --> 1:10:43.771
Senator Jackson.

1:10:47.043 --> 1:10:48.243
[whispers] Okay.

1:10:49.446 --> 1:10:50.745
Thank you.

1:10:58.121 --> 1:10:59.621
Now what?

1:10:59.623 --> 1:11:02.423
They regroup,
and they go back in.

1:11:03.960 --> 1:11:06.227
Try to get some sleep,
Avigail.

1:11:06.229 --> 1:11:07.829
I need to get out.

1:11:09.699 --> 1:11:11.132
Let's take a drive.

1:11:17.774 --> 1:11:19.440
[Ghost]
Ronan Jackson.

1:11:25.315 --> 1:11:26.881
MIT graduate.

1:11:27.550 --> 1:11:29.183
Impressive.

1:11:30.086 --> 1:11:31.686
Very impressive.

1:11:37.927 --> 1:11:40.228
Son of Senator
Richard Jackson.

1:11:40.230 --> 1:11:41.696
Ah, fuck.

1:11:43.433 --> 1:11:45.967
My boss would like
to meet you.

1:12:07.924 --> 1:12:09.691
Why are we stopping here?

1:12:09.693 --> 1:12:12.327
I have an asset nearby.
What kind of asset?

1:12:12.329 --> 1:12:14.462
-Syrian Druze.
-Did you make him?

1:12:14.464 --> 1:12:16.297
Make her. Yes.

1:12:16.299 --> 1:12:17.899
She's been vetted
and banked.

1:13:14.557 --> 1:13:16.657
[both speaking
foreign language]

1:13:24.334 --> 1:13:26.834
[foreign language]

1:13:32.442 --> 1:13:34.776
Johnson,
stay on the door.

1:13:38.114 --> 1:13:39.847
Ask her
where the package is.

1:13:39.849 --> 1:13:43.618
I speak English.
Please tell him
to come inside.

1:13:43.620 --> 1:13:46.020
If they're watching,
they will know we have talked.

1:13:46.022 --> 1:13:49.190
-Who will know?
-We share the same enemy.

1:13:49.192 --> 1:13:51.459
It would please me
if you do as I say.

1:13:51.461 --> 1:13:53.661
Invite him to come inside,
please.

1:13:59.269 --> 1:14:00.368
Johnson.

1:14:10.246 --> 1:14:12.046
[foreign language]

1:14:18.822 --> 1:14:21.022
-[groans]
-[foreign language]

1:14:28.998 --> 1:14:32.166
So, you look for
the Israeli pilot.

1:14:32.168 --> 1:14:34.969
-We do.
-Alshabah took him captive.

1:14:34.971 --> 1:14:37.171
[foreign language]
[groaning]

1:14:50.019 --> 1:14:52.920
-Where is he being held.
-You know where he's not
being held, I'm sure.

1:14:52.922 --> 1:14:55.189
Listen, I'm not here to
fucking play games with you.

1:14:55.191 --> 1:14:58.826
Neta's vouched for you,
but I've got three dead friends
in the back of my truck.

1:14:58.828 --> 1:15:01.596
That's what I have.
Now tell me
where the fuck he is.

1:15:01.598 --> 1:15:03.664
[shouting]

1:15:07.504 --> 1:15:10.371
You think you're
the first man to put
a gun into my face?

1:15:14.677 --> 1:15:17.178
I always come
with a flower in my hand,

1:15:17.180 --> 1:15:21.015
but I have
a big fucking Colt .45
if the flower doesn't work.

1:15:21.017 --> 1:15:24.118
-Where the fuck is he?
-Easy, 1-8.

1:15:24.120 --> 1:15:25.753
I'll take care
of this.

1:15:38.902 --> 1:15:40.968
[men chattering, shouting
in foreign language]

1:15:46.843 --> 1:15:48.976
[engine starts]

1:15:48.978 --> 1:15:52.713
Your pilot is on his way
to South Beirut,
I'm afraid.

1:15:52.715 --> 1:15:54.749
[shouts]

1:15:54.751 --> 1:15:58.085
Alshabah will present him
to the security general,

1:15:58.087 --> 1:16:00.621
-who will order his execution.
-When did he leave?

1:16:02.592 --> 1:16:04.125
Just now.

1:16:05.094 --> 1:16:07.161
Mm, ten minutes ago.

1:16:08.898 --> 1:16:10.998
Last week.
What difference
does it make?

1:16:12.702 --> 1:16:14.235
You won't catch him.

1:16:16.039 --> 1:16:17.838
He's a ghost.

1:16:17.840 --> 1:16:20.942
He spent eight years
in this war, and still
no one can catch him.

1:16:20.944 --> 1:16:22.376
And if we could?

1:16:22.378 --> 1:16:25.212
Then you take the M-5
towards Damascus

1:16:25.214 --> 1:16:27.081
until you hit Al-Kiswah.

1:16:27.083 --> 1:16:29.584
Alshabah will avoid
Damascus.

1:16:29.586 --> 1:16:31.852
He will take
an alternate road.

1:16:31.854 --> 1:16:35.456
That turns his three-hour drive
into a seven-hour drive.

1:16:35.458 --> 1:16:37.258
That works
to our advantage.

1:16:37.260 --> 1:16:40.561
Yes. You're already
way behind.

1:16:40.563 --> 1:16:42.430
Where is this
alternate route?

1:16:42.432 --> 1:16:46.267
It's a smuggler run
between Jdaydet Artooz
and Darayya,

1:16:46.269 --> 1:16:47.935
on the border
of Lebanon.

1:16:47.937 --> 1:16:50.738
-The Heroin Highway.
-How do you know this?

1:16:50.740 --> 1:16:53.808
The information's
floating around
out there.

1:16:53.810 --> 1:16:55.209
Easy.

1:16:58.481 --> 1:17:01.449
You just have to know
how to sweep it up.

1:17:01.451 --> 1:17:04.085
If your plan is to
intercept his convoy,

1:17:04.087 --> 1:17:06.253
I suggest you acquire

1:17:06.255 --> 1:17:08.389
more serious weapons
than those M4s.

1:17:09.826 --> 1:17:11.792
I can map
the coordinates for you...

1:17:13.162 --> 1:17:14.695
if you please.

1:17:18.067 --> 1:17:21.469
[Luria] Judah 1-6.
We're looking for a convoy

1:17:21.471 --> 1:17:23.504
that left al-Hrak
about 30 minutes ago.

1:17:23.506 --> 1:17:26.440
Our Mossad asset
puts our pilot
in that convoy.

1:17:26.442 --> 1:17:28.576
-Go to infrared.
-Switching to thermal.

1:17:31.514 --> 1:17:34.582
Do we have any idea
where he is in that convoy?
Which vehicle?

1:17:34.584 --> 1:17:36.684
We can eliminate pickup trucks
without crew cabs.

1:17:36.686 --> 1:17:38.886
Five out of the seven.

1:18:12.655 --> 1:18:15.056
[man] <i> This is North Command</i>

Out.

1:18:52.762 --> 1:18:54.995
This was Ronan's
favorite place.

1:18:57.233 --> 1:18:59.266
He came here
with his mother.

1:19:01.537 --> 1:19:04.338
I've been to Israel
a dozen times
over the years,

1:19:05.541 --> 1:19:08.743
for diplomacy and business.

1:19:08.745 --> 1:19:10.478
Never a personal visit.

1:19:15.118 --> 1:19:17.151
I've never been here
with my son.

1:19:27.263 --> 1:19:29.430

1:19:39.776 --> 1:19:42.376

1:19:42.378 --> 1:19:44.278
[Luria] <i> Roger that,</i>

1:19:52.488 --> 1:19:54.288
Is it Monday?

1:19:56.325 --> 1:19:58.425
All day, Gunny.

1:19:58.427 --> 1:19:59.960
Which way
is the shit rolling?

1:20:01.931 --> 1:20:04.665
Downhill,
towards that road.

1:20:06.435 --> 1:20:08.202
Hell of a thing
we do, huh?

1:20:14.443 --> 1:20:16.477
So how do we do this?

1:20:16.479 --> 1:20:18.279
How many vehicles
in the convoy.

1:20:18.281 --> 1:20:20.314
North Command says
they're rolling with seven.

1:20:20.316 --> 1:20:22.016
What's their big gun?

1:20:22.018 --> 1:20:24.251
Twenty-three millimeter
anti-aircraft auto cannon.

1:20:24.253 --> 1:20:26.954
ZU-23. Fucking Soviets.

1:20:26.956 --> 1:20:29.290
It's mounted
on a Nissan.

1:20:29.292 --> 1:20:33.194
-Where's the package?
-Exactly which truck it's in,
I'm confirming now.

1:20:33.196 --> 1:20:36.697
They don't know?
They've narrowed it down
to the third or fifth vehicle:

1:20:36.699 --> 1:20:40.267
the Kia K2700
and the Mitsubishi crew cab.

1:20:40.269 --> 1:20:42.203
He's definitely not
in the lead or the rear.
No.

1:20:42.205 --> 1:20:44.638
You sure about that?

1:20:44.640 --> 1:20:47.041
It would be
a tactical mistake.

1:20:47.043 --> 1:20:49.043
I think they're
better than that.

1:20:49.045 --> 1:20:50.611
Okay.

1:20:50.613 --> 1:20:53.047
We need to take out
the lead vehicle first.

1:20:53.049 --> 1:20:55.449
Next up is the Nissan
with the ZU-23.

1:20:55.451 --> 1:20:58.152
In the shit show that
immediately follows,
we'll set up

1:20:58.154 --> 1:21:00.120
an assault perimeter
and blast the hell out of them.

1:21:00.122 --> 1:21:02.122
Johnson, you and Melaku
stay with machine guns

1:21:02.124 --> 1:21:03.958
and put some lead
into their engine blocks.

1:21:03.960 --> 1:21:06.894
We want them crippled.
Reza and Sharhabi,
you advance with me.

1:21:06.896 --> 1:21:08.963
We find our pilot
and collapse back.

1:21:08.965 --> 1:21:12.566
-How do we get out?
-Same way we got in--
we drive.

1:21:12.568 --> 1:21:15.569
-What's our big gun, sir?
-The Hermes 450

1:21:15.571 --> 1:21:18.038
you got chasing us
at 17,000 feet--
is it armed?

1:21:18.040 --> 1:21:20.207
-It is.
-Hellfire missiles, huh?

1:21:20.209 --> 1:21:23.143
RAFAEL fire-and-forget
anti-tank missiles.

1:21:23.145 --> 1:21:25.679
That'll do. I'm guessing
there's a couple
under wing, right?

1:21:25.681 --> 1:21:28.382
-Good guess.
-Okay, yeah. That big enough
for you, Big Time?

1:21:33.689 --> 1:21:35.656
[spits]
Fuck, that's strong!

1:21:37.326 --> 1:21:40.094
Of course.
It'll put hair on your balls.

1:21:40.096 --> 1:21:42.830
Listen, brother,
I don't think anybody wants
hair on their balls anymore.

1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:45.966
I like hair on my balls.

1:21:47.670 --> 1:21:48.669

1:21:50.006 --> 1:21:51.639

you're gonna have
a combat scar
to hit on the ladies.

1:31:19.908 --> 1:31:21.775
What's the bad news?

1:31:21.777 --> 1:31:24.277

They've got him.

1:36:35.490 --> 1:36:37.357
They said
I'd find you here.

1:36:39.761 --> 1:36:41.127
Just, uh...

1:36:43.465 --> 1:36:44.998
I wanted to say thank you.

1:36:48.303 --> 1:36:49.636
Thank them.

1:36:52.174 --> 1:36:54.874
They say Gunnery Sergeant Torres
was a hell of a Marine.

1:36:55.911 --> 1:36:57.310
Yeah, he was.

1:36:59.181 --> 1:37:00.647
A hell of a man too.

1:37:07.122 --> 1:37:08.688
It's a big sacrifice.

1:37:10.525 --> 1:37:13.827
Five lives given
for one in return.

1:37:15.697 --> 1:37:17.330
That was the job.

1:37:20.135 --> 1:37:22.535
If asked,
we'll do it again.
