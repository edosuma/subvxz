WEBVTT

00:04.938 --> 00:07.175
I HATE MY SCHOOL PICTURE.

00:07.241 --> 00:09.210
MY HAIR LOOKS FUNNY,
MY DRESS IS UGLY,

00:09.277 --> 00:11.279
AND I'M SMILING
LIKE A GOON.

00:13.614 --> 00:15.116
YEAH. THAT'S YOU.

00:23.191 --> 00:26.194
HI, LAURA, MY LITTLE
PHOTOGENIC FOX.

00:28.129 --> 00:30.464
IT'S THAT TIME
OF YEAR AGAIN--

00:30.531 --> 00:33.434
THE DAY EVERYBODY EXCHANGES
THEIR SCHOOL PICTURES.

00:33.501 --> 00:34.402
SORRY, UM...

00:34.468 --> 00:36.637
I DON'T THINK
I CAN SPARE ONE, STEVE.

00:36.704 --> 00:38.606
I ONLY HAVE 144.

00:40.241 --> 00:41.942
OH, I UNDERSTAND.

00:42.009 --> 00:43.077
I'LL JUST STICK AROUND

00:43.144 --> 00:44.745
AND STARE
AT THE REAL THING.

00:48.582 --> 00:52.019
HERE. TAKE TWO, AND
DON'T BOTHER ME NEXT YEAR.

00:52.086 --> 00:54.088
THANK YOU, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU!

00:54.155 --> 00:56.224
I'VE GOT YOURS OUTSIDE.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.594
IS IT JUST ME,

01:00.661 --> 01:04.064
OR DO I GET BETTER-LOOKING
EVERY YEAR?

01:04.132 --> 01:06.100
IT'S JUST YOU.

01:12.306 --> 01:14.408
HERE YOU GO, MY SWEET.

01:21.215 --> 01:23.784
IT'S GOING TO BE HARD GETTING
THAT INTO MY WALLET.

01:28.822 --> 01:30.491
HI, CARL.

01:34.662 --> 01:35.663
OH, NO.

01:38.031 --> 01:39.400
THERE'S TWO OF 'EM.

01:52.246 --> 01:54.448
* IT'S A RARE CONDITION *

01:54.515 --> 01:55.949
* IN THIS DAY AND AGE *

01:56.016 --> 01:59.187
* TO READ ANY GOOD NEWS
ON THE NEWSPAPER PAGE *

01:59.253 --> 02:02.723
* AND LOVE AND TRADITION
OF THE GRAND DESIGN *

02:02.790 --> 02:07.528
* SOME PEOPLE SAY
IS EVEN HARDER TO FIND *

02:07.595 --> 02:10.231
* WELL, THEN, THERE MUST BE
SOME MAGIC CLUE *

02:10.298 --> 02:13.133
* INSIDE THESE GENTLE WALLS *

02:14.535 --> 02:18.339
* 'CAUSE ALL I SEE
IS A TOWER OF DREAMS *

02:18.406 --> 02:21.709
* REAL LOVE BURSTIN'
OUT OF EVERY SEAM *

02:23.076 --> 02:26.380
* AS DAYS GO BY *

02:26.447 --> 02:30.218
* WE'RE GONNA FILL OUR HOUSE
WITH HAPPINESS *

02:30.284 --> 02:33.354
* THE MOON MAY CRY *

02:33.421 --> 02:36.957
* WE'RE GONNA SMOTHER THE BLUES
WITH TENDERNESS *

02:37.024 --> 02:40.328
* WHEN DAYS GO BY *

02:40.394 --> 02:42.062
* THERE'S ROOM FOR YOU *

02:42.129 --> 02:43.864
* ROOM FOR ME *

02:43.931 --> 02:48.035
* FOR GENTLE HEARTS
AN OPPORTUNITY *

02:48.101 --> 02:51.405
* AS DAYS GO BY *

02:51.472 --> 02:55.309
* IT'S THE BIGGER LOVE
OF THE FAMILY *

03:09.022 --> 03:10.258
HI, HONEY.

03:10.324 --> 03:11.725
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

03:11.792 --> 03:15.329
ROUGH. I SPENT HOURS TALKING
A GUY OFF A LEDGE,

03:15.396 --> 03:17.565
THEN FOUND OUT
HE WAS A WINDOW WASHER.

03:21.702 --> 03:24.472
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DID THIS TO ME.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.139
WHY ARE YOU
SO UPSET?

03:26.206 --> 03:28.108
IT'S A STUPID
VIDEO GAME.

03:28.175 --> 03:29.243
STUPID VIDEO GAME?

03:29.310 --> 03:30.911
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM HERE?

03:30.978 --> 03:34.214
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM. I JUST
GOT THE HIGHEST SCORE EVER

03:34.282 --> 03:35.249
AT SPACE INVADERS.

03:35.316 --> 03:37.251
OH, SURE. RUB IT IN.

03:37.318 --> 03:41.422
NOW WE KNOW WHO USED TO
HAVE THE HIGHEST SCORE.

03:41.489 --> 03:43.257
I DON'T THINK GIRLS
SHOULD BE ALLOWED

03:43.324 --> 03:44.792
TO PLAY VIDEO GAMES,
PERIOD.

03:44.858 --> 03:47.160
THEY SHOULD STICK
TO CHEERLEADING

03:47.227 --> 03:48.562
WHERE THEY BELONG.

03:51.131 --> 03:55.336
THAT'S THE MOST CHAUVINISTIC
THING I HAVE EVER HEARD YOU SAY.

03:55.403 --> 03:57.137
I'LL STRAIGHTEN
HIM OUT.

03:57.204 --> 03:59.573
WE NEED TO HAVE
A LITTLE TALK.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.375
STEP INTO
MY OFFICE, PLEASE.

04:06.714 --> 04:07.681
WHAT'S WRONG?

04:10.050 --> 04:12.986
SON, I DON'T THINK YOU'RE UPSET
BECAUSE YOU WERE BEATEN.

04:13.053 --> 04:16.189
I THINK YOU'RE UPSET BECAUSE YOU
WERE BEATEN BY A GIRL.

04:16.256 --> 04:17.691
WELL, YEAH.

04:20.428 --> 04:21.595
THIS IS THE NINETIES,

04:21.662 --> 04:23.864
AGE OF
THE ENLIGHTENED MAN.

04:23.931 --> 04:26.400
WE AREN'T THREATENED
BY WOMEN WHO ARE SMARTER,

04:26.467 --> 04:29.169
MAKE MORE MONEY,
OR BEAT US AT SPORTS.

04:29.236 --> 04:30.538
WE'RE NOT?

04:30.604 --> 04:32.706
NO.

04:32.773 --> 04:37.144
SON, TODAY'S MAN IS
COMPASSIONATE AND SENSITIVE

04:37.210 --> 04:41.281
AND WANTS TO LIVE IN PEACE AND
HARMONY WITH TODAY'S FEMALE.

04:41.349 --> 04:45.118
A REAL MAN'S A MAN WHO'S
ABLE TO ADMIT DEFEAT.

04:45.185 --> 04:47.388
GO IN THERE
AND TELL LAURA

04:47.455 --> 04:48.956
YOU'RE HAPPY
FOR HER.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.291
ALRIGHT.

04:58.031 --> 04:58.999
GO AHEAD, SON.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.302
LAURA.

05:03.303 --> 05:06.574
I'M SORRY
I WAS SUCH A SORE LOSER.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.342
YOU BEAT ME
FAIR AND SQUARE.

05:08.409 --> 05:10.411
YOU DESERVE
TO BE THE CHAMP.

05:10.478 --> 05:14.114
THANKS. AND EDDIE,
I DIDN'T BEAT YOU.

05:14.181 --> 05:15.949
I CRUSHED YOU.

05:18.185 --> 05:19.920
EDWARD?

05:20.954 --> 05:22.122
YOU'RE RIGHT.

05:22.189 --> 05:25.526
LAURA, IT'S THE NINETIES,
AND I'M AN ENLIGHTENED MAN.

05:25.593 --> 05:28.362
I ONLY WANT TO LIVE IN PEACE
AND HARMONY WITH YOU.

05:28.429 --> 05:29.963
CONGRATULATIONS.

05:32.199 --> 05:33.601
WOW!

05:33.667 --> 05:36.737
YOU LEFT WITH EDDIE WINSLOW
AND RETURNED WITH ALAN ALDA.

05:49.450 --> 05:52.252
BYE, TED,
BYE.

05:52.319 --> 05:56.089
YOU GUYS
HAVE GREAT FORM.

05:56.156 --> 05:59.259
RACHEL, WILL YOU FORGET ABOUT
PICKIN' UP THOSE TWO GUYS

05:59.326 --> 06:00.694
AND PICK UP THAT SPARE.

06:01.762 --> 06:03.731
I CAN DO BOTH,
YOU KNOW.

06:14.942 --> 06:17.110
YES! YES!

06:20.781 --> 06:21.749
SNACK TIME.

06:21.815 --> 06:24.518
DID YOU GUYS
WANT SOMETHING?

06:28.789 --> 06:31.024
BOWLING WAS A GREAT IDEA.

06:31.091 --> 06:33.561
I CAN'T THINK
OF A REASON

06:33.627 --> 06:35.529
NOT TO DO THIS WEEKLY.

06:38.566 --> 06:40.634
HI, EVERYBODY.

06:40.701 --> 06:43.170
I JUST THOUGHT
OF A REASON.

06:44.805 --> 06:46.840
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

06:46.907 --> 06:48.976
I COME FOUR TIMES
A WEEK.

06:49.042 --> 06:50.711
LIKE A SECOND HOME.

06:50.778 --> 06:54.181
OH, NO, CARL.
THAT WOULD BE YOUR PLACE.

06:56.650 --> 06:58.919
DAD, IT'S YOUR TURN.

06:58.986 --> 07:00.120
GO GET HIM.

07:11.431 --> 07:12.432
GO AHEAD, CARL.

07:12.500 --> 07:15.035
-AFTER YOU.
-I INSIST.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.069
NO PLEASE.

07:16.136 --> 07:17.671
NO, REALLY,
I COULDN'T.

07:17.738 --> 07:18.806
ETIQUETTE
DEMANDS DEFERENCE

07:18.872 --> 07:22.175
TO THE BOWLER
ON THE LEFT, UNLESS--

07:22.242 --> 07:23.877
JUST BOWL.

07:24.812 --> 07:26.446
THANK YOU.

07:43.531 --> 07:46.099
WOULD YOU
THROW THE BALL!

07:47.868 --> 07:49.069
SURELY.

07:58.211 --> 07:59.847
A LITTLE HIGH
IN THE POCKET.

07:59.913 --> 08:01.882
FORTUNATELY,
I GOT GOOD PIN ACTION.

08:03.416 --> 08:05.152
I'LL GIVE YOU
SOME PIN ACTION.

08:17.297 --> 08:19.700
I WAS ROBBED.
THAT SHOULD
HAVE BEEN A STRIKE.

08:19.767 --> 08:23.170
WELL, NOT REALLY, CARL.
YOUR PUSHOFF WAS LATE,

08:23.236 --> 08:25.706
AND YOU SHORT-ARMED
ON THAT FOLLOW-THROUGH.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.276
OF COURSE 9 OUT OF 10
IS VERY GOOD.

08:31.411 --> 08:34.181
LISTEN, CARL.
THIS IS AN EASY SPARE
TO PICK UP.

08:34.247 --> 08:35.415
NO PROBLEM.

08:35.482 --> 08:36.784
CAN'T MISS.

08:48.562 --> 08:49.863
WHOOPS. GUESS YOU CAN.

08:55.836 --> 08:57.805
WELL,
NOT A GREAT FINISH,

08:57.871 --> 08:59.973
BUT WE STILL WIN.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.174
NOT YET, CARL.

09:01.241 --> 09:03.443
IF HARRIETTE THROWS
THREE STRIKES
IN A ROW,

09:03.510 --> 09:05.545
SHE BEATS YOU
BY ONE PIN.

09:06.513 --> 09:08.315
MOM CAN
STILL WIN.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.583
ARE YOU KIDDING?

09:09.650 --> 09:11.518
MOM COULD
NEVER BEAT DAD.

09:11.585 --> 09:14.087
EDDIE,
NEVER SAY NEVER.

09:14.154 --> 09:14.955
THAT'S RIGHT. NEVER.

09:15.022 --> 09:16.590
SHOW THEM
WHAT YOU CAN DO.

09:16.657 --> 09:19.092
SHE CAN BOWL.
GO AHEAD. SHOW THEM.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.706
WHOO!
THAT'S IT.

09:32.773 --> 09:35.876
SHE'S GOOD, CARL. TWO MORE OF
THOSE AND YOU'RE HISTORY.

09:45.919 --> 09:46.987
YES!

09:47.054 --> 09:48.555
HEY.

09:48.622 --> 09:52.325
WHOA! THAT'S TWO, CARL.
HANGING BY A THREAD.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.506
YES!

10:06.573 --> 10:08.608
UH-HUH.

10:08.676 --> 10:10.678
SHE DID IT, CARL.
SHE BEAT YOU.

10:10.744 --> 10:13.213
YOU TOOK THE GAS.
YOU WENT BELLY UP.

10:16.750 --> 10:19.720
OF COURSE THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH SECOND PLACE.

10:23.791 --> 10:25.558
HARRIETTE,
I WANT A REMATCH.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.928
MM-HMM. SO DOES
MIKE TYSON.

10:32.733 --> 10:34.401
COME ON.
LET'S GO HOME.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.803
UH-UH!

10:36.636 --> 10:38.071
WE'RE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.741
I'M SERIOUS. I WANT A REMATCH.
YOU JUST GOT LUCKY.

10:40.808 --> 10:43.176
I WANT A REMATCH,
AND I WANT IT NOW.

10:57.490 --> 11:02.896
THE WINNER AND STILL CHAMPION,
CARL OTIS WINSLOW!

11:02.963 --> 11:04.898
[DOES IMPRESSION OF
CROWD CHEERING]

11:10.637 --> 11:12.372
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT MAN.

11:12.439 --> 11:15.575
HARRIETTE, JUST BE GLAD
CARL WON THE REMATCH,

11:15.642 --> 11:18.779
OR WE'D STILL BE
AT THE BOWLING ALLEY.

11:18.846 --> 11:21.548
I HATE BOWLING.
IT'S A STUPID SPORT.

11:21.614 --> 11:23.283
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

11:23.350 --> 11:26.720
THEY RUN AN UGLY TEN POUND BALL
AND BUNCHA UGLY STICKS

11:26.787 --> 11:28.989
WHILE YOU'RE
WEARING UGLY SHOES.

11:29.056 --> 11:31.224
IT'S AN UGLY SPORT.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.062
IT'S A GREAT SPORT.

11:36.730 --> 11:38.665
AND DO YOU KNOW WHY?

11:38.732 --> 11:41.902
BECAUSE
IT'S A MAN'S SPORT.

11:41.969 --> 11:44.337
THEY MAKE THE BALL HEAVY
SO WOMEN WILL KNOW

11:44.404 --> 11:46.006
TO LEAVE IT ALONE.

11:46.073 --> 11:47.574
EXCUSE ME,
MR. TURKEY.

11:47.640 --> 11:50.510
IF MAMA HAD BEAT DADDY
THE LAST TIME--

11:50.577 --> 11:52.679
HEY! HEY, HEY.
IT'S LATE.

11:52.746 --> 11:54.714
AND I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANYMORE
FIGHTING.

11:54.782 --> 11:56.483
GO UPSTAIRS
AND GO TO BED.

11:58.285 --> 11:59.286
HE STARTED IT.

11:59.352 --> 12:00.520
HOW DID I START IT?

12:00.587 --> 12:01.822
BY BEING BORN FIRST.

12:01.889 --> 12:04.457
YOU GOT THE WHOLE FAMILY OFF
ON THE WRONG FOOT.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.832
FIVE HOURS
AT A BOWLING ALLEY--

12:11.899 --> 12:14.467
THAT'S THE MOST TIME I EVER
SPENT IN RENTED SHOES.

12:16.169 --> 12:19.672
I HOPE CARL GOT THAT GLOATING
OUT OF HIS SYSTEM.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.909
LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN,

12:23.010 --> 12:26.446
AS THE WINNER OF
THE BOWLING REMATCH,

12:26.513 --> 12:28.215
I HEREBY
DECLARE THIS

12:28.281 --> 12:31.218
AN OFFICIAL CARL
WINSLOW HOLIDAY.

12:32.986 --> 12:35.688
LOOKS LIKE THERE'S STILL
A COUPLE OF GLOATS LEFT.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.125
EXCUSE ME. I'M GOING
TO GO CHECK ON RICHIE.

12:39.059 --> 12:40.760
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?

12:40.828 --> 12:42.595
I THOUGHT WE ALL
HAD FUN TONIGHT.

12:42.662 --> 12:44.097
HEE HEE HEE HEE.

12:45.899 --> 12:48.836
CARL, NO ONE HAD
FUN TONIGHT BUT YOU.

12:48.902 --> 12:51.271
I'M SURPRISED
AT YOU.

12:51.338 --> 12:53.773
I THOUGHT YOU WERE A
BETTER LOSER THAN THIS.

12:53.841 --> 12:56.209
YOU WON THE REMATCH, OK?
CASE CLOSED.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.347
NOW, COME ON,
HARRIETTE.

13:01.714 --> 13:04.051
I THINK WE NEED TO
TALK ABOUT THIS NOW.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.685
YOU SHOULDN'T FEEL BAD

13:05.752 --> 13:08.755
JUST BECAUSE
I'M THE BETTER BOWLER.

13:08.822 --> 13:11.258
-OKAY, I DON'T FEEL BAD.
-GOOD.

13:11.324 --> 13:13.994
BECAUSE I
REALLY FEEL BAD

13:14.061 --> 13:15.829
ABOUT BEING
THE BETTER BOWLER

13:15.896 --> 13:17.464
IF IT MADE
YOU FEEL BAD.

13:18.698 --> 13:20.367
GIVE ME A BREAK.

13:20.433 --> 13:22.970
NO. COME ON.
YOU'LL FEEL BETTER

13:23.036 --> 13:25.372
IF YOU CAME RIGHT OUT
AND SAID IT.

13:26.406 --> 13:30.677
THAT I'M THE
BETTER BOWLER.

13:30.743 --> 13:32.512
THAT I'M A BETTER BOWLER
THAN YOU.

13:34.447 --> 13:35.815
DON'T PUSH ME, CARL.

13:38.852 --> 13:42.289
THE FOUNDATION
OF A GOOD MARRIAGE

13:42.355 --> 13:43.123
IS TRUTH,

13:43.190 --> 13:44.724
AND AS HUSBAND AND WIFE,

13:44.791 --> 13:48.128
I THINK THAT YOU AND I SHOULD
FACE THAT TRUTH TOGETHER.

13:48.195 --> 13:50.463
LET'S JUST FACE
THAT TRUTH, HARRIETTE.

13:52.132 --> 13:54.634
HERE WE GO NOW.
JUST SAY,

13:54.701 --> 13:58.005
"MY HUSBAND CARL
IS A BETTER BOWLER."

13:58.071 --> 13:59.439
OK. THAT DID IT.

13:59.506 --> 14:02.242
YOU WANT TO FACE SOME TRUTH?
HOW ABOUT THIS TRUTH?

14:02.309 --> 14:04.878
THE REASON
YOU WON THAT REMATCH

14:04.945 --> 14:08.415
WAS BECAUSE
I LET YOU WIN.

14:08.481 --> 14:10.717
YOU DON'T REALLY
EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE THAT.

14:10.783 --> 14:14.121
YEAH, THAT IS NOT
THE FIRST TIME.

14:14.187 --> 14:17.157
I'VE LET YOU WIN AT BOWLING
SINCE BEFORE WE WERE MARRIED.

14:19.059 --> 14:21.995
WELL, RICHIE'S FINE.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.630
