00:12.011 --> 00:14.213
[Cheers and applause] >>
John: Welcome, welcome,

00:14.214 --> 00:19.219
welcome to "last week
tonight." I'm John Oliver.

00:22.956 --> 00:27.961
Thank you so much
for joining us.

00:30.630 --> 00:35.602
Just time for a quick
recap of the week,

00:37.904 --> 00:40.572
which has been a busy one,
from Trump imposing tariffs on

00:40.573 --> 00:43.342
Chinese goods to the attorney
general facing off with congress

00:43.343 --> 00:46.145
in a borderline nstitional
crisis you've probably already

00:46.146 --> 00:50.282
forgotten about to this: >>
Russian president Vladimir putin

00:50.283 --> 00:54.353
tumbled to the ice while taking
a victory lap after playing a

00:54.354 --> 00:55.020
hockey game.

00:55.021 --> 00:58.757
Putin did not see a mat that
had been ld out on the ice.

00:58.758 --> 01:00.826
I feel badly for
whoever put out the carpet.

01:00.827 --> 01:02.094
I feel very badly.

01:02.095 --> 01:03.529
Yeah, I wouldn't
want to be that guy.

01:03.530 --> 01:04.863
John: Yeah,
'cause he's dead now.

01:04.864 --> 01:07.166
That carpet guy is dead.

01:07.167 --> 01:09.835
Probably rolled up
in that same carpet.

01:09.836 --> 01:10.536
Why?

01:10.537 --> 01:13.205
Because putin has people
killed and interferes in U.S.

01:13.206 --> 01:14.506
Elections with no consequences.

01:14.507 --> 01:17.776
But still, it was a fuclip
I liked it when he fell.

01:17.777 --> 01:23.048
T inead of focusing on that, we
begin tonight closer to home in

01:23.049 --> 01:26.251
Georgia, the state whose most
famous export is now shorthand

01:26.252 --> 01:27.219
for butts.

01:27.220 --> 01:30.456
And in case you're not
fluent in sex-related emojis,

01:30.457 --> 01:33.592
I'll break it down for
you: A peach means a butt,

01:33.593 --> 01:36.361
an eggplant means a penis,
a taco means a vagina,

01:36.362 --> 01:39.998
water droplets mean ejaculate,
cherries mean testicles,

01:39.999 --> 01:42.201
grapes mean a bun of fferent
testicles stuck together,

01:42.202 --> 01:45.037
a tomato means a butt that's
been spray-painted red,

01:45.038 --> 01:48.040
a baguette means a French penis,
a cucumber means a penis that

01:48.041 --> 01:50.008
has been cut into
slices, and lastly,

01:50.009 --> 01:52.411
a coconut means a coconut,
but one you can fuck.

01:52.412 --> 01:53.078
Where was I?

01:53.079 --> 01:53.745
Oh, right.

01:53.746 --> 01:54.413
Georgia.

01:54.414 --> 01:56.014
Earlier this ek, their
governor, Brian kemp,

01:56.015 --> 01:59.885
signed a draconian bill which
would ban abortions after a

01:59.886 --> 02:04.156
fetal heartbeat is detected,
which can be as early as six

02:04.157 --> 02:08.026
weeks into a pregnancy, before
many women are even aware

02:08.026 --> 02:08.794
they're pregnant.

02:08.794 --> 02:10.895
And it doesn't stop there.

02:10.896 --> 02:13.699
The bill gives a fetus
natural person status which

02:13.700 --> 02:16.435
allows the fetus to be
entitled to child support,

02:16.436 --> 02:18.704
claimed as a dependent
on tax returns,

02:18.705 --> 02:21.306
and included in
Georgia's population.

02:21.307 --> 02:24.176
Abortions will be allowed
only if a fetus has a fatal

02:24.177 --> 02:26.845
deformity, the mother's
life is endangered,

02:26.846 --> 02:31.617
or in rape and incest cases
where a police report was filed.

02:31.618 --> 02:32.284
John: Okay.

02:32.285 --> 02:35.988
Two things here: First, "tax
breaks begin at conception"

02:35.989 --> 02:39.057
might be literally the most
republican law ever created.

02:39.058 --> 02:42.127
And second, it's pretty
egregious to only make an

02:42.128 --> 02:45.664
exception for rape or incest
"where a police report was file"

02:45.665 --> 02:49.101
I guess that's to separate the
incest they're talking about

02:49.102 --> 02:51.303
fromour n of the
mill cousin-fucking.

02:51.304 --> 02:56.174
Or, as it's more commonly known,
"a giuliani marriage." And as if

02:56.175 --> 02:59.444
the bill itself were
not crazy enough,

02:59.445 --> 03:01.980
there were some spectacular
moments in the debate over it,

03:01.981 --> 03:05.250
like this one from
representative Darlene Taylor.

03:05.251 --> 03:10.255
Who speaks for
the baby named fetus?

03:10.256 --> 03:12.591
Who speaks fothe by named fetus?

03:12.592 --> 03:15.761
Well, today I'm going to.

03:15.762 --> 03:20.766
To quote baby fetus, "I
deserve to have the right too.

03:20.767 --> 03:24.336
Some may squirm in their
seats or turn their backs,

03:24.337 --> 03:28.941
but I will speak today."
Baby fetus says, and I quote,

03:28.942 --> 03:31.510
"I have that right.

03:31.511 --> 03:37.649
Don't be afraid or intimidated
about acknowledging me." >>

03:37.650 --> 03:39.051
John: Okay, let's
walk through this.

03:39.052 --> 03:42.254
First, she explicitly says she's
speaking not on behalf of a

03:42.255 --> 03:45.524
fetus, but on behalf of
baby whose name is fetus.

03:45.525 --> 03:48.894
Then she's somehow quoting
this made-up baby fetus,

03:48.895 --> 03:51.463
despite the fact that
babies can't speak or write,

03:51.464 --> 03:53.932
so she has no source
mateal from which to quote.

03:53.933 --> 03:56.668
I actually think my feelings
on this might be best summed up

03:56.669 --> 04:00.939
baby fetus' seminal 1973
autobiography "all the things I

04:00.940 --> 04:04.743
didn't say because I'm not
real." If I may quote baby

04:04.744 --> 04:06.912
fetus, "a fetus is not a baby.

04:06.913 --> 04:09.915
And, in fact, at six weeks,
a fetus isn't even a fetus.

04:09.916 --> 04:12.284
It's an embryo the size
of a pomegranate seed.

04:12.285 --> 04:15.621
Also, on an unrelated note, I
bet the sex that Jim and Pam

04:15.622 --> 04:18.857
have is fine, but I bet the sex
that Pam and Roy used to have

04:18.858 --> 04:19.524
was better.

04:19.524 --> 04:23.095
This is the hill I would die
on were I not too fictional to

04:23.096 --> 04:27.599
die." that's a direct quote
from baby fetus in 1973.

04:27.600 --> 04:31.803
Now, I should note that this
law won't take effect in Georgia

04:31.804 --> 04:34.873
till 2020 -- if it ever
does, because it's blatantly

04:34.874 --> 04:35.907
unconstitutional.

04:35.908 --> 04:38.877
But Georgia wasn't the only
state considering restrictive

04:38.878 --> 04:40.012
abortion laws this week.

04:40.013 --> 04:42.981
Alabama, the state whose flag
looks like their application to

04:42.982 --> 04:47.252
be a state was rejected, is on
the verge of approving a bill

04:47.253 --> 04:50.188
that would effectively ban most
abortions at every stage of

04:50.189 --> 04:52.891
pregnancy, and doctors who
perform them could be charged

04:52.892 --> 04:56.094
with a felony and face
up to 99 years in prison.

04:56.095 --> 04:58.897
Meanwhile, Ohio -- which
already passed one of the cotry'

04:58.898 --> 05:01.633
strictest abortion laws earlier
this year -- is now considering

05:01.634 --> 05:04.703
putting more restrictions in
women's way: >> Lawmakers are

05:04.704 --> 05:07.406
considering a bill that
would prohibit most insurance

05:07.407 --> 05:11.176
companies from offering
coverage for abortion services.

05:11.177 --> 05:14.513
It would include drugs or
devices used to prevent the

05:14.514 --> 05:17.683
implementation of
a fertilized ovum.

05:17.684 --> 05:20.952
John: So if that bill passes,
even women who do qualify for an

05:20.953 --> 05:22.954
abortion may struggle
to pay for one.

05:22.955 --> 05:24.790
At that point, why stop there?

05:24.791 --> 05:27.459
Why not pass a bill saying, "all
women seeking an abortion in

05:27.460 --> 05:30.562
Ohio must first tie up all the
remaining plot threads on "game

05:30.563 --> 05:33.398
of thrones" in one single
episode of television.

05:33.399 --> 05:36.268
Everyone knows that can't
be done, and frankly,

05:36.269 --> 05:39.037
I feel terrible for any
network stupid enough to try.

05:39.038 --> 05:42.541
Now some opponents have
expressed concern that bill

05:42.542 --> 05:45.377
could also prevent insurance
companies from covering certain

05:45.378 --> 05:48.547
forms of birth control and
contraception -- you know,

05:48.548 --> 05:51.349
the things that help prevent
unwanted pregnancies --

05:51.350 --> 05:53.118
something that
the bill's author,

05:53.119 --> 05:56.655
representative John Becker,
does not seem to have given much

05:56.656 --> 05:57.322
thought.

05:57.323 --> 05:59.624
When we asked where
contraceptives like plan b and

05:59.625 --> 06:03.095
the morning-after pill fall,
Becker said: >> I don't know

06:03.096 --> 06:07.799
because I'm not smart enough to
know what causes abortions and

06:07.800 --> 06:09.534
what doesn't.

06:09.535 --> 06:11.803
The bill is just written
"if it causes an abortion,

06:11.804 --> 06:15.974
"and people smarter than me
can figure out what that means.

06:15.975 --> 06:16.641
John: Wow.

06:16.642 --> 06:19.177
"I just wrote the bill, someone
smarter than me can figure out

06:19.178 --> 06:22.280
what it means." It seems like
lawmakers should exhibit a

06:22.281 --> 06:24.282
little more awareness of what
they're releasing than the

06:24.283 --> 06:26.218
makers of the "Sonic
the hedgehog" movie.

06:26.219 --> 06:29.955
"Look, I dunno, I just had the
cgi team mock up a furry potato

06:29.956 --> 06:30.856
with a corpse's face.

06:30.857 --> 06:33.825
Someone smarter than me can
figure out if that's nostalgic

06:33.826 --> 06:37.629
for people." And look, I don't
know if the bill written by that

06:37.630 --> 06:39.931
not-smart-enough-man who's
dressed like the devil in a

06:39.932 --> 06:42.033
community theater
play will pass.

06:42.034 --> 06:42.701
I don't know.

06:42.702 --> 06:46.371
It's complete fucking
nonsense, so I'd hope not,

06:46.372 --> 06:47.606
but you never know.

06:47.607 --> 06:49.775
And if you're sensing a pattern
here, that might be because,

06:49.776 --> 06:53.545
just this year, states have
introduced more than 250 bills

06:53.546 --> 06:55.080
restricting abortion access.

06:55.081 --> 06:58.250
It's pretty clear, with a
conservative supreme court,

06:58.251 --> 07:00.952
lawmakers are taking every shot
they can to get a case that

07:00.953 --> 07:02.788
might end up overturning roe v.

07:02.789 --> 07:04.489
Wade, and they're
going to keep trying.

07:04.490 --> 07:08.860
Which is why it's incumbent on
all of us to pay close attention

07:08.861 --> 07:12.697
so if I may address those
lawmakers in the words of an

07:12.698 --> 07:14.633
unexpectedly literate
baby, "listen,

07:14.634 --> 07:19.471
I'm not a constitutional scholar
-- I'm not anything -- but if I

07:19.472 --> 07:22.507
were, I'd tell you that laws
like these deny women agency

07:22.508 --> 07:25.710
over their own bodies, and your
actions put their health and

07:25.711 --> 07:26.511
lives at risk.

07:26.512 --> 07:29.414
But hey, why not ask the women
affected what they think,

07:29.415 --> 07:31.650
because they're actual
people, unlike me,

07:31.651 --> 07:36.656
a fucking fictional baby
named fetus." And now this.

07:38.691 --> 07:43.428
Announcer: And now,
excruciating awkward silences

07:43.429 --> 07:48.200
caused by technical
difficulties.

07:48.201 --> 07:53.206
She is traveling with
the president right now.

07:55.808 --> 08:00.813
Caitlyn, what is the white
house saying about this shift?

08:06.285 --> 08:11.990
James, can you hear me?

08:11.991 --> 08:17.696
Cesar, can you hear me?

09:03.309 --> 09:07.479
Well -- [stammers] >>
How do we stay on track?

09:07.480 --> 09:12.083
Stephanie, can you hear me?

09:12.084 --> 09:13.618
Yes.

09:13.619 --> 09:15.153
Moving on.

09:15.154 --> 09:20.992
Our main story tonight concerns
earth, which, for the record,

09:20.993 --> 09:22.560
is not flat.

09:22.561 --> 09:24.562
Earth is, of
course, cylindrical.

09:24.563 --> 09:27.799
That's why we can both see the
curve of the horizon and fall

09:27.800 --> 09:28.800
off the edge of the planet.

09:28.801 --> 09:30.368
It's just science, everyone.

09:30.369 --> 09:32.370
That's a science fact.

09:32.371 --> 09:34.839
Specifically, we want to talk
about the challenges facing the

09:34.840 --> 09:37.609
environment, and often when
the subject comes up on TV,

09:37.610 --> 09:41.112
the solution is presented as a
bunch of fun recycling ideasike

09:41.113 --> 09:44.215
this: >> So we're having an
earth day birthday party.

09:44.216 --> 09:47.452
So, check this one out, your
old garden hoses -- do you love

09:47.453 --> 09:48.320
these little baskets?

09:48.321 --> 09:48.987
Oh!

09:48.988 --> 09:49.654
Baskets!

09:49.655 --> 09:50.322
Oh, that's cute.

09:50.323 --> 09:50.989
So easy to make.

09:50.990 --> 09:54.926
No special tools, it's
just a hose and zip ties.

09:54.927 --> 09:55.593
That's it.

09:55.594 --> 09:57.228
Oh, my gosh!

09:57.229 --> 09:58.263
John: Oh, my gosh.

09:58.264 --> 10:02.701
It's weird to see a grown adult
be that excited by some garden

10:02.702 --> 10:04.736
ses ed together with zip ties.

10:04.737 --> 10:07.806
Although I have to admit,
it's pretty fucking awesome.

10:07.807 --> 10:12.243
I mean, I had this old garden
hose lying around my living room

10:12.244 --> 10:15.613
for ages, and I had no
idea what to do with it.

10:15.614 --> 10:18.883
Now it's a basket I use for
all those picnics I attend!

10:18.884 --> 10:22.354
I love it, and I wish to be
buried with my hose basket.

10:22.355 --> 10:27.359
Unfortunately, fun, crafty tips
like those clearly aren't doing

10:27.360 --> 10:28.927
enough to save our planet.

10:28.928 --> 10:31.029
These days, we're
inundated with new,

10:31.030 --> 10:33.098
terrifying headlines
on a regular basis,

10:33.099 --> 10:36.167
including a landmark report
from the united nations panel on

10:36.168 --> 10:40.105
climate change just last fall
that contained some devastating

10:40.106 --> 10:41.239
conclusions.

10:41.240 --> 10:43.475
The scientists found that
if greenhouse gas emissions

10:43.476 --> 10:46.745
continue at the current rate,
we could start seeing worsening

10:46.746 --> 10:51.182
food shortages and wildfires and
a mass dieoff of coral reefs as

10:51.183 --> 10:53.185
soon as 2040.

10:54.687 --> 10:57.622
John: 2040 -- that's
just 21 years from now!

10:57.623 --> 11:01.126
By that point, Finn
wolfhard will only be 37,

11:01.127 --> 11:05.096
Ariana grande will only be 46,
and Lou dobbs will only have

11:05.097 --> 11:06.731
been dead for 30 years.

11:06.732 --> 11:11.603
So to have any hope of
avoiding those consequences,

11:11.604 --> 11:14.205
the report found that
unprecedented efforts are going

11:14.206 --> 11:17.342
to be required, and to that end,
there's one recent proposal that

11:17.343 --> 11:18.476
gets discussed a lot.

11:18.477 --> 11:21.846
Here are a few of the times it
was mentioned just in the past

11:21.847 --> 11:23.081
week.

11:23.082 --> 11:24.416
She backs the green new deal.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.317
The green new
deal makes no sense.

11:26.318 --> 11:28.186
How do you achieve
the green new deal?

11:28.187 --> 11:29.654
Factor in the new green deal.

11:29.655 --> 11:30.889
Green new deal.

11:30.890 --> 11:31.589
Green new deal.

11:31.590 --> 11:32.824
A green new deal.

11:32.825 --> 11:34.225
Green new deal.

11:34.226 --> 11:35.960
The green n deal.

11:35.961 --> 11:37.729
The green new deal.

11:37.730 --> 11:39.197
The green new deal.

11:39.198 --> 11:40.965
[Crowd booing] >> John: If you
knew nothing else about the

11:40.966 --> 11:43.701
green new deal, you now know
that everyone's talking about

11:43.702 --> 11:46.571
it, and it was booed at a Trump
rally, therefore it's a, famous,

11:46.572 --> 11:48.573
and b, probably good.

11:48.574 --> 11:52.610
And again, all those
clips were from this week,

11:52.611 --> 11:54.746
which is pretty amazing
considering the fact that the

11:54.747 --> 11:58.083
senate voted the green new
deal down six week ago.

11:58.084 --> 11:58.783
Think about that.

11:58.784 --> 12:02.320
How often do we talk about
legislation after congress votes

12:02.321 --> 12:02.987
it down?

12:02.988 --> 12:06.024
How often do we talk about
legislation before congress

12:06.025 --> 12:06.891
votes it down?

12:06.892 --> 12:10.195
We talk out gislation about as
much as we talked about "suits"

12:10.196 --> 12:12.263
before we knew who
Meghan markle was.

12:12.264 --> 12:16.034
You weren't talking about
"suits." You didn't go to the

12:16.035 --> 12:17.569
water cooler and
say, "hey, Fred,

12:17.570 --> 12:19.404
you catch 'suits'
the other night?

12:19.405 --> 12:23.708
That Harvey specter as portrayed
by Gabriel macht sure is a piece

12:23.709 --> 12:24.509
of work, eh?

12:24.510 --> 12:25.710
On 'suits'?"

12:25.711 --> 12:29.781
On the TV program 'suits' that
has captured my imagination?"

12:29.782 --> 12:34.486
And the green new deal has
been famously polarizing.

12:34.487 --> 12:36.855
On the one hand, all these
senators running for president

12:36.856 --> 12:37.789
co-sponsored it.

12:37.790 --> 12:41.025
On the other hand, Republicans
have been foaming at the mouth

12:41.026 --> 12:44.863
to criticize it for all the
crazy provisions they insist it

12:44.864 --> 12:49.501
he so-called green new deal
proposes the elimination of air

12:49.502 --> 12:50.168
travel.

12:50.169 --> 12:55.106
Eliminating cars,
airplanes, flatulent cows, and,

12:55.107 --> 12:57.675
for good measure, tearing
down all of our buildings.

12:57.676 --> 13:00.178
You can't stop
cows from flatulating,

13:00.179 --> 13:03.581
you gotta eliminate cows, which
means they're comin' after our

13:03.582 --> 13:04.849
hamburgers, congressman.

13:04.850 --> 13:07.085
They want to take
away your hamburgers.

13:07.086 --> 13:12.023
This is what Stalin dreamt
about but never achieved.

13:12.024 --> 13:14.325
John: What are
you talking about?

13:14.326 --> 13:16.427
That's not Stalin's dream.

13:16.428 --> 13:18.163
That is the hamburglar's dream.

13:18.164 --> 13:22.100
You're confusing Stalin
with the hamburglar.

13:22.101 --> 13:24.802
Which is actually
understandable.

13:24.803 --> 13:27.005
One said "the state is an
instrument in the hands of the

13:27.006 --> 13:31.142
ruling class" while the other
said "robble robble." You know,

13:31.143 --> 13:32.510
similar vibes, but you
know, similar vibes,

13:32.511 --> 13:33.178
subtle differences.

13:33.179 --> 13:36.881
So given that the green new deal
is still very much on people's

13:36.882 --> 13:40.418
minds, we thought it'd be worth
taking a look tonight at what it

13:40.419 --> 13:43.454
is, what it isn't,
and most importantly,

13:43.455 --> 13:44.889
where we should
maybe go from here.

13:44.890 --> 13:46.925
And the first thing to
understand is that the green new

13:46.926 --> 13:50.361
deal doesn't even mention the
word "cows" or "airplanes." In

13:50.362 --> 13:52.764
fact, while it's sometimes
discsed ke it's filled with

13:52.765 --> 13:55.800
specific programs to fight
climate change, it isn't.

13:55.801 --> 13:59.437
It's a non-binding resolution
that very briefly sets out some

13:59.438 --> 14:02.607
extremely aggressive goals,
including achieving net-zero

14:02.608 --> 14:05.410
greenhouse gas emissions,
meeting 100% of the country's

14:05.411 --> 14:07.612
power demand through
clean, renewable,

14:07.613 --> 14:09.314
and zero-emission
energy sources,

14:09.315 --> 14:12.383
and creating millions of good,
high-wage jobs in the united

14:12.384 --> 14:13.051
states.

14:13.052 --> 14:16.421
The whole green new deal
is just 14 pages long.

14:16.422 --> 14:19.924
That is 7 seven pages shorter
than the menu for the cheesecake

14:19.925 --> 14:23.161
factory -- a menu
which, by the way,

14:23.162 --> 14:25.496
should have exactly
one thg ont: Pie.

14:25.497 --> 14:27.098
That's right, I said it.

14:27.099 --> 14:28.967
Pie is the only good dessert.

14:28.968 --> 14:29.801
It's got fruit.

14:29.802 --> 14:30.568
It's got bread.

14:30.569 --> 14:31.269
It's got goo.

14:31.270 --> 14:33.238
It is a true triple threat.

14:33.239 --> 14:35.206
Fuck you, cakes.

14:35.207 --> 14:36.507
Pie forever!

14:36.508 --> 14:40.511
I do not yield any ground.

14:40.512 --> 14:43.948
But it's important to note,
the green new deal contains no

14:43.949 --> 14:46.951
specifics on w it will
achieve any of its goals,

14:46.952 --> 14:50.154
which sounds like a criticism,
but it is really not.

14:50.155 --> 14:53.057
The plan's backers, led by
Alexandria ocasio-Cortez,

14:53.058 --> 14:57.061
said repeatedly, right from the
outsetthathe green new deal was

14:57.062 --> 14:59.564
merely meant to kick-start
a conversation -- set some

14:59.565 --> 15:03.635
aggressive targets, so we could
then figure out how to hit them.

15:03.636 --> 15:08.506
Our first step is to define
the problem and define the scope

15:08.507 --> 15:12.644
of the solution, and so
we're here to say that small

15:12.645 --> 15:16.881
incremental policy
solutions are not enough.

15:16.882 --> 15:17.548
John: Right.

15:17.549 --> 15:20.118
At a certain point, your
problems get so big that you

15:20.119 --> 15:22.420
have no choice but
to do methg drastic.

15:22.421 --> 15:24.255
Sometimes you just
get in too deep.

15:24.256 --> 15:25.857
Sometimes you make a
young man's mistake,

15:25.858 --> 15:28.259
like falling in love with the
beautiful wife of a mafioso.

15:28.260 --> 15:31.462
He puts a price on your head,
she swears she'll leave him for

15:31.463 --> 15:33.798
you, but you can't do that,
can't make her live the life of

15:33.799 --> 15:36.334
a fugitive, so you fake your
own death in a falafel cart

15:36.335 --> 15:38.770
collision and sail to America
to start things fresh.

15:38.771 --> 15:41.072
You tell everyone there you
were a comedian in england,

15:41.073 --> 15:44.742
and despite your ridiculous
cartoon accent and no one in

15:44.743 --> 15:48.046
england having ever heard of
you, nobody really questions it.

15:48.047 --> 15:49.947
And it's a kind of
life, I suppose,

15:49.948 --> 15:52.583
eking out a living reading off
stats and jokes once a week on

15:52.584 --> 15:55.887
premium cable, but not a night
goes by you don't dream of the

15:55.888 --> 16:01.426
white sardinian sands and
the soft lips of Isabella.

16:01.427 --> 16:03.895
â™ª â™ª Just an example.

16:03.896 --> 16:08.901
Just an example off
the top of my head.

16:11.403 --> 16:14.605
So the green new deal was ant
to be a conversation starter.

16:14.606 --> 16:17.875
But unless you like bad faith
conversations about farting

16:17.876 --> 16:20.845
cows, that conversation
has not gone well so far.

16:20.846 --> 16:22.947
And much of that was
clearly inevitable.

16:22.948 --> 16:25.950
There were people who were never
going to support this plan.

16:25.951 --> 16:28.386
But there were also some
self-inflicted wounds.

16:28.387 --> 16:31.622
The reason you hear hamburgers
come up so much is that aoc's

16:31.623 --> 16:35.993
office mistakenly sent an early
draft of an faq to reporters

16:35.994 --> 16:39.997
containg lguage like "we set a
goal to get to net-zero rather

16:39.998 --> 16:43.101
than zero emissions in ten years
because we aren't sure that

16:43.102 --> 16:45.703
we'll be able to fully get rid
of farting cows and airplanes

16:45.704 --> 16:48.639
that fast," which is clearly
supposed to be a joke,

16:48.640 --> 16:51.209
but it wasn't a great
time to attempt one.

16:51.210 --> 16:55.179
And even aoc admits the rollout
of the green new deal was "the

16:55.180 --> 16:58.316
biggest mistake she's made in
congress." And shs right about

16:58.317 --> 17:01.753
that, because it gave an opening
for these idiots to pretend the

17:01.754 --> 17:04.922
green new deal was all about
hamburger stealing when it is

17:04.923 --> 17:05.589
not.

17:05.590 --> 17:08.925
Although, for the record, there
are real environmental issues

17:08.926 --> 17:12.329
surrounding cattle farming --
among them that cows do emit a

17:12.330 --> 17:14.365
lot of methane, which
is a greenhouse gas.

17:14.366 --> 17:17.568
Although even there, is a
slight although even there,

17:17.569 --> 17:19.404
there's a slight misconception
about which end of the cow is

17:19.405 --> 17:20.070
most responsible.

17:20.071 --> 17:22.573
First, I want to correct a
misnomer that cows don't fart,

17:22.574 --> 17:24.742
they actually belch.

17:24.742 --> 17:25.609
John: It's true.

17:25.611 --> 17:29.580
Most cow methane comes from
them belching, not farting.

17:29.581 --> 17:33.985
And if you only remember one
fact from tonight's show,

17:33.986 --> 17:37.488
please do not let
it be that one.

17:37.489 --> 17:38.156
Please.

17:38.157 --> 17:39.857
Just forget that now.

17:39.858 --> 17:42.727
But while the rollout of this
conversation has been bumpy,

17:42.728 --> 17:45.696
it it is great that the green
new deal has started one.

17:45.697 --> 17:48.933
So let's talk about what a plan
to combat combat change could

17:48.934 --> 17:49.600
look like.

17:49.601 --> 17:51.269
And the first thing
to understand is,

17:51.270 --> 17:54.705
no one solution is going
to be nearly enough here.

17:54.706 --> 17:56.874
We need to tace th
from multiple angles,

17:56.875 --> 17:58.910
and there are lots
of ideas out there,

17:58.911 --> 18:01.112
including building
a better power grid,

18:01.113 --> 18:04.215
improving battery storage,
developing low-carbon jet fuel,

18:04.216 --> 18:05.850
electrifying
industrial processes,

18:05.851 --> 18:08.286
blding cities more
densely, phasing out hfcs,

18:08.287 --> 18:11.055
developing lab-grown meat,
building better nuclear plants,

18:11.056 --> 18:13.090
upgrading our thermostats,
increasing mass transit

18:13.091 --> 18:15.526
ridership, and scaling up
carbon capture technology.

18:15.527 --> 18:17.195
And I could talk
about all of those,

18:17.196 --> 18:19.797
but it would take all night,
and I know you want to watch the

18:19.798 --> 18:22.633
rerun of "game of thrones" so
you can see what garbage from

18:22.634 --> 18:24.936
craft services they've hidden
as an easter egg this week!

18:24.937 --> 18:25.603
There!

18:25.604 --> 18:26.637
Right there!

18:26.638 --> 18:30.608
Those pringles aren't
supposed to be there!

18:30.609 --> 18:35.780
They don't have that type
of pringles in Westeros!

18:35.781 --> 18:38.916
That's ridiculous!

18:38.917 --> 18:43.321
So instead, let's focus on one
policy that you're likely to

18:43.322 --> 18:45.790
hear about as this
conversation continues,

18:45.791 --> 18:47.425
and that's carbon pricing.

18:47.426 --> 18:50.261
The current situation
with carbon is critical.

18:50.262 --> 18:54.365
Carbon emissions are, by far,
the largest source of greenhouse

18:54.366 --> 18:58.436
gases, yet right now, it's
basically free to pollute the

18:58.437 --> 19:01.239
air with carbon dioxide,
which is a little weird.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.474
We've universally
agreed polluting is bad,

19:03.475 --> 19:06.744
and yet it's fr to it.

19:06.745 --> 19:08.913
When you litter, you pay a fine.

19:08.914 --> 19:11.682
When you drive above the
speed limit, you pay a fine.

19:11.683 --> 19:15.119
When you steal 400 hamsters from
petsmart, tie them to a sled,

19:15.120 --> 19:17.255
and race through the
streets on a hamster sleigh,

19:17.256 --> 19:18.322
you pay a fine.

19:18.323 --> 19:19.624
Is that fine worth it?

19:19.625 --> 19:20.625
Yes, of course it is.

19:20.626 --> 19:23.294
But you pay it.

19:23.295 --> 19:25.530
Now, carbon pricing is
a little complicated,

19:25.531 --> 19:28.032
so to break down
the logic behind it,

19:28.033 --> 19:30.868
I've enlisted the help of a
guy who's made a career of

19:30.869 --> 19:34.639
explaining complex ideas
with fun, visual stunts.

19:34.640 --> 19:35.306
Hi, John.

19:35.307 --> 19:36.741
Bill nye the science guy here.

19:36.742 --> 19:40.444
I'm going to explain the
complicated logic behind carbon

19:40.445 --> 19:41.112
pricing.

19:41.113 --> 19:43.481
But rst, safety glasses on.

19:43.482 --> 19:48.452
When something costs more,
people buy less of it.

19:48.453 --> 19:50.288
Safety glasses off.

19:50.289 --> 19:52.790
That's it.

19:52.791 --> 19:54.926
John: That's it?

19:54.927 --> 19:56.060
Oh.

19:56.061 --> 19:58.329
Honestly, I was expecting
something bit re fun and visual

19:58.330 --> 19:59.630
than that, bill.

19:59.631 --> 20:01.732
Could you maybe explain the
long-term impact of carbon

20:01.733 --> 20:05.636
pricing, maybe with a cool stunt
to jazz up what you're saying?

20:05.637 --> 20:07.138
Go on.

20:07.139 --> 20:09.273
Okay, safety glasses on.

20:09.274 --> 20:13.611
When we release carbon -- s, by
burning coal or driving an SUV

20:13.612 --> 20:17.815
-- all of us pay for that, in
the form of things like fires,

20:17.816 --> 20:19.717
floods, and crop failures.

20:19.718 --> 20:24.722
Putting a fee on carbon creates
incentives to emit less carbon.

20:24.723 --> 20:27.959
Incentivizes the development
of low-carbon technology.

20:27.960 --> 20:31.062
Which is huge, because that's
vital to reducing emissions

20:31.063 --> 20:31.729
globally.

20:31.730 --> 20:33.431
And because, for
some reason, John,

20:33.432 --> 20:36.801
you're a 42-year-old man o
needs s attention sustained with

20:36.802 --> 20:42.873
tricks, here's some fucking
mentos in a bottle of diet coke.

20:42.874 --> 20:45.009
Happy now?

20:45.010 --> 20:47.178
John: Yes, I am happy!

20:47.179 --> 20:48.779
I am happy!

20:48.780 --> 20:50.915
The coke went high!

20:50.916 --> 20:53.584
The mentos made it fizzy!

20:53.585 --> 20:55.186
I love it!

20:55.187 --> 20:57.221
I love it, bill!

20:57.222 --> 20:57.888
I love it!

20:57.889 --> 20:58.556
I love it!

20:58.557 --> 20:59.223
I love it!

20:59.224 --> 21:05.229
But his point about
incentivizing new technology is

21:05.230 --> 21:06.764
important.

21:06.765 --> 21:09.233
Because our current low-carbon
technology strategy is,

21:09.234 --> 21:12.637
essentially, "hope this guy
stops calling people pedophiles

21:12.638 --> 21:15.439
long enough to invent an
affordable electric car." And

21:15.440 --> 21:18.676
right now, the pedophile-to-car
balance is way off.

21:18.677 --> 21:24.348
So, in theory, putting a price
on carbon makes total sense.

21:24.349 --> 21:26.951
And you should know there's
absolutely nothing extreme about

21:26.952 --> 21:27.618
this idea.

21:27.619 --> 21:30.821
Economists across thpolitical
spectrum support it,

21:30.822 --> 21:33.591
and more than 40 governments
worldwide have done it,

21:33.592 --> 21:36.961
including in the u.K., where
carbon pricing has contributed

21:36.962 --> 21:41.332
to co2 emissions falling to
their lowest level since 1890.

21:41.333 --> 21:42.366
That's right.

21:42.367 --> 21:45.536
The lowest level since before
Mary poppins danced with chimney

21:45.537 --> 21:48.472
sweeps and introduced the
banks children to cocaine.

21:48.473 --> 21:50.675
Yes, cocaine.

21:50.676 --> 21:53.844
You thought the spoonful of
sugar was actually sugar?

21:53.845 --> 21:54.612
Come on!

21:54.613 --> 21:57.615
How do you explain
the dancing penguins?

21:57.616 --> 21:59.483
She gave those children cocaine!

21:59.484 --> 22:01.519
And she changed
their lives forever.

22:01.520 --> 22:06.525
Now, there are different ways
to put a price on carbon.

22:08.527 --> 22:11.762
One is cap and trade, where
you cap the total amount of

22:11.763 --> 22:15.032
emissions companies are allowed
to release and let them trade

22:15.033 --> 22:17.201
emsions permits
among themselves.

22:17.202 --> 22:19.804
Or there's the more
straightforward carbon tax,

22:19.805 --> 22:23.340
which just adds a surcharge to
activities that emit carbon.

22:23.341 --> 22:26.477
The problem there is
mostly the word "tax,

22:26.478 --> 22:28.713
"which is a dirty
word in politics.

22:28.714 --> 22:30.214
Just look at what
happened in Canada,

22:30.215 --> 22:33.184
which rolled out a new carbon
tax that went into effect just

22:33.185 --> 22:34.018
last month.

22:34.019 --> 22:36.420
Although it wasn't
easy to do that.

22:36.421 --> 22:39.657
Justin trudeau desperately
tried not to use the word tax,

22:39.658 --> 22:42.126
instead calling it a
"price on pollution,

22:42.127 --> 22:46.430
"and when he slipped up once,
just look how people reacted.

22:46.431 --> 22:51.436
What we are also guaranteeing
is that this tax -- [crowd

22:55.140 --> 23:00.145
shouting] This, uh, price
on carbon will be -- [crowd

23:05.717 --> 23:08.252
Shouting] >> John: Listen to the
level of excitement over that

23:08.253 --> 23:09.220
slip-up.

23:09.221 --> 23:12.823
If you're a politician, you
just can't say the word "tax,

23:12.824 --> 23:14.925
"in the same way that if you're
an actor you can't say the word

23:14.926 --> 23:17.194
"MacBeth," and if you're the
president of the United States,

23:17.195 --> 23:20.631
you can't say the word
"origins." >> I hope they now go

23:20.632 --> 23:25.736
and take look at the oranges --
the oranges of thenvestigaon --

23:25.737 --> 23:29.140
the beginnings of
the investigation.

23:29.141 --> 23:31.842
John: It's funny 'cause his
brain is turning into pudding.

23:31.843 --> 23:35.279
Anyway, the int, trudeau
simply saying the word "tax" was

23:35.280 --> 23:40.417
described as "trudeau trips on
his own words." So on one level,

23:40.418 --> 23:43.888
you can kind of understand his
reluctance to use that term,

23:43.889 --> 23:46.791
because it exposed him to
fearmongering about what his

23:46.792 --> 23:48.392
policy would mean
for gular people,

23:48.393 --> 23:51.996
which sometimes took the form
of catchy slam poetry from his

23:51.997 --> 23:53.597
political opponents.

23:53.598 --> 23:55.733
We can't afford
this onerous fee.

23:55.734 --> 23:58.302
11 cents more for
a liter of fuel,

23:58.303 --> 24:00.771
taxing me and my ks' school.

24:00.772 --> 24:04.041
Farms and families will feel the
pinch when the carbon tax man

24:04.042 --> 24:04.942
pulls the cinch.

24:04.943 --> 24:07.812
Tax the tractor, combine, plow.

24:07.813 --> 24:09.880
Tax the chicken, egg, and cow.

24:09.881 --> 24:11.849
Carbon tax man, enough's enough.

24:11.850 --> 24:15.153
Don't cat-tax Canadians
on all their stuff.

24:18.123 --> 24:19.490
John: Fire.

24:19.491 --> 24:22.860
Look, I don't care where
you stand on this issue,

24:22.861 --> 24:27.298
no one wants to hear a rhyme
about carbon taxes from anybody,

24:27.299 --> 24:30.267
let alone some guy who looks
like he got his entire wardrobe

24:30.268 --> 24:35.273
at not a fan. Ohn Oliver." But
he is speaking to a real concern

24:38.710 --> 24:39.376
there.

24:39.377 --> 24:43.447
How do y -- now you see it.

24:43.448 --> 24:45.716
Now you can't unsee it.

24:45.717 --> 24:50.722
How do you put a price on carbon
and make things more expensive,

24:52.991 --> 24:55.025
without harming the people
who can least afford it?

24:55.026 --> 24:57.761
And what Canada's doing to
address this is pretty simple:

24:57.762 --> 25:00.431
Very basically, they're taking
the money they collect and

25:00.432 --> 25:01.765
giving it back to
their citizens.

25:01.766 --> 25:04.435
They're doing this by pooling
the money gathered by increased

25:04.436 --> 25:07.238
fees on things like gas
and heat, dividing it up,

25:07.239 --> 25:10.341
and sending it back to
taxpayers as a rebate.

25:10.342 --> 25:12.910
In fact, they've designed it so
that the rebates in Canada are

25:12.911 --> 25:16.280
anticipated to exceed the
increased costs for about 70% of

25:16.281 --> 25:20.284
households, with lowest-income
households seeing the most

25:20.285 --> 25:21.418
benefits from the policy.

25:21.419 --> 25:22.119
Which is great.

25:22.120 --> 25:26.123
But even with that being true,
the fight over a carbon tax was,

25:26.124 --> 25:28.726
and still is,
difficult in Canada.

25:28.727 --> 25:32.663
It's no wonder some politicians
in this country are wary of even

25:32.664 --> 25:34.598
attempting a debate
about carbon pricing.

25:34.599 --> 25:37.134
In fact, the last serious
attempt that got any real

25:37.135 --> 25:40.437
traction was ten years ago,
when congress tried passing a

25:40.438 --> 25:44.074
cap-and-trade bill, and
the debate got so toxic,

25:44.075 --> 25:46.343
West Virginia democrat Joe
manchin was comfortable

25:46.344 --> 25:50.080
expressing his displeasure like
this: >> I'm Joe manchin and I

25:50.081 --> 25:53.117
approve this ad because I'll
always defend West Virginia.

25:53.118 --> 25:57.121
I sued epa, and I
will take dead aim...

25:57.122 --> 25:59.123
[Gunshot] At the
cap-and-trade bill,

25:59.124 --> 26:02.726
'cause it's bad
for West Virginia.

26:02.727 --> 26:07.164
John: Now that may seem
idiotic, because it is,

26:07.165 --> 26:10.601
but in fairness, that is the
only way to stop a bill from

26:10.602 --> 26:11.268
becoming a law.

26:11.269 --> 26:12.703
That bill had a knife!

26:12.704 --> 26:14.171
That bill had a knife!

26:14.172 --> 26:15.339
You all saw it!

26:15.340 --> 26:16.573
You all saw it!

26:16.574 --> 26:18.042
It reached for its pocket.

26:18.043 --> 26:22.613
Look, look, look, I know
this can all seem hopeless,

26:22.614 --> 26:24.515
especially under the
current administration,

26:24.516 --> 26:27.818
but there are actually some
small signs that the tide may be

26:27.819 --> 26:28.652
turning.

26:28.653 --> 26:32.189
The very fact we're still
talking about the green new deal

26:32.190 --> 26:33.357
is really encouraging.

26:33.358 --> 26:36.560
Plus, the percentage of
conservative Republicans who say

26:36.561 --> 26:39.496
they are "very" or "somewhat"
worried by global warming has

26:39.497 --> 26:41.699
more than doubled in
the last five years.

26:41.700 --> 26:45.336
Even Mitch McConnell finally
acknowledged the role of humans

26:45.337 --> 26:47.805
in altering the climate for
the first time a few weeks ago.

26:47.806 --> 26:50.641
And yes, it's a bit like
giving a speech titled,

26:50.642 --> 26:53.344
"alf actually just a big
puppet." I mean, yeah, Mitch,

26:53.345 --> 26:58.148
it's barrsing it's taken
you this long to accept it.

26:58.149 --> 27:01.452
But better late
than never, I guess.

27:01.453 --> 27:05.589
And however bumpy its
rollout was, to its credit,

27:05.590 --> 27:08.592
the green new deal has
succeeded in gettinpeop talking.

27:08.593 --> 27:12.029
But that won't mean anything
unless that talk now turns to

27:12.030 --> 27:12.830
actions.

27:12.831 --> 27:15.733
And putting a price on carbon
could potentially be one of

27:15.734 --> 27:16.400
them.

27:16.401 --> 27:18.969
Although -- let me reiterate --
it won't be enough on its own,

27:18.970 --> 27:20.337
by a long shot.

27:20.338 --> 27:23.173
We're going to need a lot of
different policies working in

27:23.174 --> 27:25.843
tandem and we have to
take action right now.

27:25.844 --> 27:28.946
But you don't have
to take that from me.

27:28.947 --> 27:33.117
Instead, I'm happy to say that
bill nye has agreed to help

27:33.118 --> 27:37.621
drive the urgency home by
actually doing one of his

27:37.622 --> 27:39.590
enjoyable light-hearted
demonstrations.

27:39.591 --> 27:43.327
So, bill -- please -- do you
have a fun experiment for us?

27:43.328 --> 27:46.497
Here, I've got an
experiment for you.

27:46.498 --> 27:48.766
Safety glasses on.

27:48.767 --> 27:51.135
By the end of this century,
if emissions keep rising,

27:51.136 --> 27:54.004
the average temperature on earth
could go up another four to

27:54.005 --> 27:54.838
eight grees.

27:54.839 --> 27:58.008
What I'm saying is, the
planet's on fucking fire.

27:58.009 --> 28:01.211
There are lots of things
we can do to put it out.

28:01.212 --> 28:02.880
Are any of them free?

28:02.881 --> 28:03.914
No, of course not!

28:03.915 --> 28:05.149
Nothing's free, you idiots!

28:05.150 --> 28:06.216
Grow the fuck up!

28:06.217 --> 28:07.384
You're not children anymore.

28:07.385 --> 28:10.187
I didn't mind explaining
photosynthesis to you when you

28:10.188 --> 28:14.158
were 12, but you're adults now,
and this is an actual crisis.

28:14.159 --> 28:17.528
Got it safety glasses
off, motherfuckers.

28:17.529 --> 28:22.533
John: I think we've
all broken bill nye.

28:22.534 --> 28:27.738
And I, for one, am absolutely
on board with his new,

28:27.739 --> 28:28.939
gritty reboot.

28:28.940 --> 28:30.941
That's our show, thanks
so much for watching.

28:30.942 --> 28:31.708
See you next week.

28:31.709 --> 28:32.376
Good night!

28:32.377 --> 28:37.382
