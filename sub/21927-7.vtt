00:03.504 --> 00:05.587
<i>The average American consumes</i>

00:05.797 --> 00:08.414
<i>55 pounds of beef per year.</i>

00:09.009 --> 00:10.625
<i>And then there's Texas,</i>

00:10.844 --> 00:13.336
<i>where we can knock that off
in a couple of months.</i>

00:13.555 --> 00:16.343
<i>Maybe faster, if we're talking
about smoked brisket...</i>

00:21.980 --> 00:23.846
<i>...curiously,
the one cut of beef</i>

00:24.066 --> 00:26.729
<i>that Texans and Jews
agree upon.</i>

00:29.154 --> 00:30.986
This is
really good, Meemaw.

00:31.365 --> 00:32.481
Really good?

00:32.741 --> 00:34.858
You're spitting the best
brisket in Texas

00:35.077 --> 00:36.363
all over the damn table.

00:36.578 --> 00:38.035
Close your mouth
when you eat.

00:38.247 --> 00:40.159
Or aim your face
the other way.

00:40.374 --> 00:42.707
Connie, one of these days,
you got to give me the recipe.

00:43.001 --> 00:44.788
You bet. For sure.

00:45.003 --> 00:47.165
- One of these days.
- Oh, come on.

00:47.381 --> 00:48.622
You can't hold on to it forever.

00:48.840 --> 00:49.956
Mean that much to you?

00:50.175 --> 00:51.336
Mary and I were dating
about a month

00:51.552 --> 00:53.214
when she brought me
home for dinner.

00:53.595 --> 00:54.551
I took one bite of this brisket,

00:54.763 --> 00:55.970
and I knew I loved
your daughter.

00:56.181 --> 00:57.422
Gee, thanks.

00:57.641 --> 00:58.506
Kind of like <i>Sleeping Beauty,</i>

00:58.725 --> 01:00.057
except Dad kissed meat.

01:02.646 --> 01:03.557
I tell you what.

01:04.063 --> 01:04.769
You go get a...

01:05.524 --> 01:06.480
piece of paper and a pencil,

01:06.692 --> 01:07.773
I'll write it down for you.

01:07.985 --> 01:10.693
Okay. It's happening...

01:14.366 --> 01:16.028
That's the fastest
I've seen him run.

01:16.243 --> 01:18.155
It's the only time
I've seen him run.

01:20.122 --> 01:20.828
There you go.

01:21.039 --> 01:21.870
Okay.

01:26.253 --> 01:27.369
I might make it
this weekend.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.079
Or you could try
a vegetable.

01:29.298 --> 01:30.960
Vegetable?
That's funny.

01:34.261 --> 01:35.126
Okay.

01:35.762 --> 01:37.503
Now, this is for
your eyes only.

01:37.723 --> 01:38.884
You're not to share it
with anybody.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.681
I never... I would never.

01:47.399 --> 01:48.640
You're a horrible person.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.524
What'd it say?

01:50.736 --> 01:51.772
I want to know
what it said.

01:51.987 --> 01:53.649
- Me, too.
- Just eat.

01:53.864 --> 01:55.230
Can I read it?

02:00.162 --> 02:01.619
You are a horrible person.

02:01.830 --> 02:02.991
Ain't I?

02:03.206 --> 02:03.866
All right, that's enough

02:04.082 --> 02:05.368
about the brisket.

02:05.584 --> 02:07.746
You kids excited for
the church picnic tomorrow?

02:07.961 --> 02:09.622
- Not really.
- I don't know.

02:09.838 --> 02:10.999
Oh, come on.

02:11.214 --> 02:13.171
You all saw the flier.
The three "F" s:

02:13.383 --> 02:15.215
food, fun, and fellowship.

02:15.469 --> 02:16.129
<i>And I'm bringing</i>

02:16.345 --> 02:18.632
a big slab of my brisket.

02:18.847 --> 02:19.758
That's it.

02:22.017 --> 02:23.883
15 years in this family, and
all the time I've been nothing

02:24.144 --> 02:25.885
but a good,
supportive son-in-law.

02:26.104 --> 02:27.345
I always treated
your daughter right,

02:27.564 --> 02:29.305
I gave you three
beautiful grandchildren.

02:29.524 --> 02:31.891
<i>Only thing I ever asked in
return was that damn recipe.</i>

02:36.406 --> 02:37.442
You're right.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.612
Get another piece of paper.
I'll write it down.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.037
Don't mess with me, Connie.

02:45.248 --> 02:47.285
Get the paper before
I change my mind.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.964
You're gonna do it
to him again, aren't you?

02:56.426 --> 02:57.837
I kind of have to.

03:19.991 --> 03:22.529
<i>George,
she was just fooling with you.</i>

03:22.744 --> 03:24.326
<i>No, no, she's mean.</i>

03:24.538 --> 03:25.745
<i>She got a black heart.</i>

03:25.956 --> 03:26.992
<i>She does not.</i>

03:27.207 --> 03:28.823
<i>Why do you
always side with her?</i>

03:29.126 --> 03:30.583
<i>Well, she is my mother.</i>

03:30.794 --> 03:31.910
<i>And there it is.</i>

03:32.129 --> 03:33.040
<i>There's the problem.</i>

03:33.255 --> 03:35.121
<i>You should be siding
with me.</i>

03:35.340 --> 03:38.253
<i>- Over brisket?
- It's notjust brisket.</i>

03:38.468 --> 03:40.460
<i>It's the way she's been
treating me since day one.</i>

03:40.679 --> 03:43.296
<i>Like I'm some kind of
loser, a booby prize.</i>

03:43.598 --> 03:46.011
- "Booby prize."
<i>- What was that?</i>

03:52.065 --> 03:54.557
Georgie, you mind
your own business.

03:55.402 --> 03:56.483
What did I do?

03:58.363 --> 03:59.820
What's going on?

04:00.240 --> 04:02.527
Mom and Dad are fighting.

04:02.826 --> 04:04.067
What about?

04:04.286 --> 04:05.276
Brisket.

04:07.956 --> 04:09.163
If they get a divorce,
who do you think

04:09.374 --> 04:10.831
you'll pick to live with?

04:12.294 --> 04:13.830
Well, Mom, of course.

04:14.045 --> 04:15.752
I want Mom. Pick again.

04:19.968 --> 04:21.254
I thought Dad was coming.

04:21.470 --> 04:22.836
No, he had work to do.

04:23.054 --> 04:25.421
- What kind of work?
- I don't know. Coaching stuff.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.051
Can't he do it
after the picnic?

04:27.267 --> 04:29.054
- No, Missy, he cannot.
- Why not?

04:29.269 --> 04:30.305
Enough.

04:31.730 --> 04:33.562
How come Georgie's
not going?

04:33.774 --> 04:36.983
He's grounded for eavesdropping
on me and your father.

04:39.321 --> 04:41.028
Well, I hope he learned
his lesson.

04:41.698 --> 04:43.485
Is this about the recipe?

04:44.868 --> 04:47.326
I bet he's mad 'cause you
always side with Meemaw.

04:48.163 --> 04:49.449
And how would you know that?

04:49.915 --> 04:51.122
Georgie told me.

04:51.333 --> 04:53.450
Are you and Dad
getting a divorce?

04:53.668 --> 04:55.000
'Course not.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.166
Well, if you do,
I want to live with you.

04:58.381 --> 05:00.873
Sheldon, no one's
getting a divorce.

05:01.092 --> 05:02.333
But thank you, honey.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.054
You know this
all goes away

05:07.307 --> 05:10.015
if you just give him your
recipe for the brisket.

05:10.227 --> 05:11.183
I know.

05:11.895 --> 05:12.806
And?

05:13.522 --> 05:15.639
I guess it's not going away.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.937
I wasn't
eavesdropping.

05:23.657 --> 05:24.738
Don't worry about it.

05:24.950 --> 05:26.816
I just don't see why
I got grounded.

05:27.035 --> 05:28.367
What are you complaining about?

05:28.703 --> 05:30.410
You didn't want to go
to church picnic anyway.

05:30.622 --> 05:32.659
I like complaining.
I'm good at it.

05:39.631 --> 05:40.963
I'll be right back.

05:42.551 --> 05:43.712
Mind if I have
a sip of your beer?

05:43.927 --> 05:46.260
You mind if I dip your head
in the compost heap?

05:47.889 --> 05:49.380
You could have
just said no.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.326
What are you doing?

06:19.296 --> 06:20.912
Nothing!
Get out of here.

06:21.423 --> 06:23.039
You're looking for
her brisket recipe.

06:23.258 --> 06:24.749
All of a sudden you got smart?

06:24.968 --> 06:26.004
I said get out of here.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.676
I won't tell, I swear.

06:29.514 --> 06:30.630
All right, help me look.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.263
- Ooh.
- Found it?

06:38.481 --> 06:40.268
No, this is her French toast.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.475
You're not looking
for French toast.

06:42.777 --> 06:44.234
She does make it good, though.

06:44.446 --> 06:45.937
Did you know
she puts vanilla extract

06:46.156 --> 06:47.021
in her whipped cream?

06:47.240 --> 06:48.572
I did not.

06:48.909 --> 06:49.865
Quarter teaspoon.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.408
- Georgie?
- Yeah?

06:51.620 --> 06:53.236
We're looking for brisket!

06:54.331 --> 06:55.412
Cranky.

07:00.545 --> 07:02.207
<i>We're home.</i>

07:02.464 --> 07:03.329
Be cool.

07:03.590 --> 07:05.081
I'm cool. You be cool.

07:14.559 --> 07:15.424
Real cool.

07:36.331 --> 07:38.539
He thought I wrote it down.

07:40.335 --> 07:41.576
What a dope.

07:45.090 --> 07:48.333
<i>Seltzer...</i>

07:48.551 --> 07:50.338
<i>...hair tonic. Hair tonic.</i>

07:54.140 --> 07:55.506
Need help putting the kids down?

07:55.725 --> 07:57.466
No, thank you, I've been
taking care of them all day.

07:57.686 --> 07:58.927
I think I can
finish the job.

07:59.145 --> 08:00.431
Oh, come on, don't do that.

08:00.647 --> 08:02.013
Don't do what?

08:04.734 --> 08:06.100
Never mind.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.152
Just so you know,
Sheldon and Missy won

08:12.367 --> 08:13.858
the three-legged race
because she told him

08:14.077 --> 08:16.364
a bee was chasing them,
and you missed it.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.992
I'm sorry, I-I just needed
a break from your mother.

08:19.207 --> 08:21.699
Yeah, well, you took a break
from your family.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.955
How long is this feud
between you two gonna go on?

08:24.170 --> 08:25.206
That's up to her.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.497
You are both such...

08:28.216 --> 08:30.799
stubborn...
donkey butts!

08:31.011 --> 08:32.751
Missy!

08:32.971 --> 08:34.131
Go to bed.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.508
<i>You don't know it's me.</i>

08:42.731 --> 08:43.437
Hey.

08:44.649 --> 08:45.856
What do you want?

08:46.776 --> 08:48.392
Don't be that way.

08:48.611 --> 08:49.943
I brought you a cold one.

08:51.865 --> 08:52.821
Thanks.

08:53.324 --> 08:54.280
I still don't like you.

09:01.249 --> 09:03.491
Would this change
your feelings?

09:06.087 --> 09:06.952
Is that it?

09:07.464 --> 09:09.251
The Holy Grail.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.086
What changed your mind?

09:15.305 --> 09:17.092
You not going
to the picnic today,

09:17.307 --> 09:18.969
that hurt Mary
and the twins.

09:19.184 --> 09:20.720
I cannot have that
on my heart.

09:21.102 --> 09:23.219
- Is that so?
- Absolutely.

09:24.522 --> 09:25.729
Look me in the eye
and tell me

09:25.940 --> 09:28.023
this is the actual recipe.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.936
George, what you have
in your hand

09:32.197 --> 09:35.281
is the exact
step-by-step instructions

09:35.575 --> 09:38.443
on how to make my brisket.

09:38.703 --> 09:41.946
I have never written it down
until tonight because...

09:43.416 --> 09:45.749
I was afraid
someone might steal it.

09:46.503 --> 09:48.870
<i>But I'm entrusting
this to you,</i>

09:49.089 --> 09:52.799
and I hope that someday,
when the time is right,

09:53.009 --> 09:56.548
you will see fit to share it
with one of your children.

09:56.763 --> 09:57.970
Connie, I don't
know what to say.

09:58.181 --> 09:59.638
Don't call me Connie.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.763
Call me Mom.

10:03.186 --> 10:04.472
Thanks, Mom.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.725
You're welcome, son.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.021
Mmm.

10:11.444 --> 10:12.730
What a dope.

10:19.869 --> 10:22.031
<i>The next morning,
my dad embarked</i>

10:22.247 --> 10:25.490
<i>on a doomed quest
to make the perfect brisket.</i>

10:26.751 --> 10:27.491
Can I help you?

10:28.253 --> 10:29.164
Matter of fact, you can.

10:30.922 --> 10:34.381
I need 12 pounds of prime Angus
with a medium deckle,

10:34.592 --> 10:38.051
ideally slaughtered in the
spring, no later than mid-June.

10:43.101 --> 10:44.308
<i>For the spice rub,</i>

10:44.519 --> 10:46.306
<i>Meemaw had him drive
to New Orleans</i>

10:46.521 --> 10:49.685
<i>to buy ground coffee
from CafÃ© Du Monde,</i>

10:50.233 --> 10:53.442
<i>and seven ounces of something
called "holy ghost root"</i>

10:53.736 --> 10:56.149
<i>from a voodoo woman
named Madam Laveau.</i>

10:57.699 --> 10:59.361
Could you grind my root for me?

11:02.245 --> 11:04.908
I-I'm-a... I'm-a rub it
on brisket.

11:11.754 --> 11:14.872
<i>Then back home,
he applied the spice rub</i>

11:15.091 --> 11:17.253
<i>with such erotic tenderness,</i>

11:17.468 --> 11:20.051
<i>it made my mother
a little jealous.</i>

11:23.892 --> 11:25.599
<i>Finally, the cooking began.</i>

11:32.901 --> 11:35.939
<i>14 hours of cooking.</i>

11:36.446 --> 11:37.527
<i>And basting.</i>

11:39.908 --> 11:40.898
<i>And spritzing.</i>

11:42.619 --> 11:44.155
<i>And tending to the fire.</i>

11:50.793 --> 11:55.663
<i>Until it was finally time
to let the meat rest.</i>

12:02.597 --> 12:04.304
Rest, my darling.

12:06.559 --> 12:07.470
Rest.

12:07.685 --> 12:11.554
Mmm. This CafÃ© Du Monde coffee
is very good.

12:11.940 --> 12:13.351
They make it with chicory.

12:14.275 --> 12:15.891
And what does it do
to the brisket?

12:16.194 --> 12:17.401
Oh, I have no idea.

12:18.738 --> 12:19.353
Then...

12:19.572 --> 12:21.985
why did you send George
all the way to New Orleans?

12:22.200 --> 12:24.237
Well, they don't sell this
around here.

12:25.119 --> 12:25.734
Mmm.

12:25.954 --> 12:27.365
Here we go.

12:28.456 --> 12:31.745
15 years and 14 hours later.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.826
Best brisket in Texas.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.050
<i>Connie, you evil bitch!</i>

12:42.262 --> 12:44.595
It's smoother
than regular coffee.

12:45.556 --> 12:47.218
That wasn't the recipe.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.265
You looked me in the eye,
and you lied to me.

12:49.477 --> 12:50.433
Oh, Mom.

12:50.645 --> 12:52.728
You broke into my home
and tried to steal it.

12:52.939 --> 12:53.895
Oh, George.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.143
You told her we
went over there?

12:55.358 --> 12:57.020
Oh, George Jr.

12:57.235 --> 12:58.942
I didn't say nothing.
I was cool.

12:59.153 --> 13:00.769
I am loving this.

13:00.989 --> 13:02.730
I don't want this woman
in my house anymore.

13:02.991 --> 13:04.778
- She is my mother.
- She is the devil.

13:04.993 --> 13:06.734
And what if the kids
want to see her?

13:07.870 --> 13:08.610
Fine.

13:08.830 --> 13:10.787
Schedule it
for when I'm not here.

13:10.999 --> 13:12.535
Or when I'm dead.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.087
And quit drinking my coffee.

13:31.477 --> 13:33.434
Turn off your train,
we've got to talk.

13:34.731 --> 13:36.142
About what?

13:36.357 --> 13:37.848
Mom is so upset
about Dad and Meemaw,

13:38.067 --> 13:39.353
she might want a divorce.

13:39.610 --> 13:40.976
No one's getting divorced.

13:41.195 --> 13:42.106
How do you know?

13:43.823 --> 13:45.405
Great, now I have
to throw that out.

13:46.576 --> 13:49.660
Mother-in-laws are always held
in low regard by the father.

13:49.871 --> 13:51.954
It rarely leads
to a breakup of the family.

13:52.332 --> 13:53.163
<i>He's right.</i>

13:53.374 --> 13:55.707
Fred and Wilma
are still happily married.

13:56.794 --> 13:57.500
I think if we can figure out

13:57.712 --> 13:59.624
a way for Dad to get
Meemaw's brisket recipe,

13:59.839 --> 14:01.080
this all goes away.

14:01.382 --> 14:03.499
I don't see how
we can accomplish that.

14:05.428 --> 14:06.168
Put that down.

14:06.387 --> 14:07.423
<i>That's not a toy.</i>

14:07.638 --> 14:08.378
Sure it is.

14:08.598 --> 14:09.964
Choo choo.

14:10.641 --> 14:12.303
<i>Choo choo...</i>

14:12.769 --> 14:14.681
<i>Choo choo.</i>

14:15.438 --> 14:17.350
Open wide, Moonpie.

14:17.565 --> 14:20.023
Here comes the choo choo train.

14:20.234 --> 14:22.146
Choo choo.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.194
Mmm. Isn't that good?

14:25.615 --> 14:28.699
That's Meemaw's famous brisket.

14:29.285 --> 14:30.776
Would you like
the secret recipe?

14:32.330 --> 14:34.868
You promise not to tell anybody?

14:35.291 --> 14:37.658
Of course you're not gonna
tell anybody.

14:37.877 --> 14:41.211
I start with a tablespoon
of cumin,

14:41.672 --> 14:44.756
and then a cup
of brown sugar, and...

14:45.093 --> 14:46.209
I know the recipe.

14:46.636 --> 14:47.342
What?

14:47.553 --> 14:48.543
She told it to me.

14:48.763 --> 14:49.469
When?

14:49.680 --> 14:51.672
February 14, 1982.

14:52.266 --> 14:54.349
I was 23 months old,
it was Valentine's Day,

14:54.560 --> 14:55.767
and Mom and Dad
went out for dinner.

14:56.646 --> 14:58.262
You were there.
Don't you remember?

15:03.444 --> 15:04.651
I got nothing.

15:04.862 --> 15:07.104
You can really remember
when you were that little?

15:07.323 --> 15:08.564
Uh-huh. You were there, too.

15:08.783 --> 15:10.490
You were still struggling
with potty training.

15:10.701 --> 15:12.237
I don't think so.

15:12.453 --> 15:15.571
Oh, yes. Meemaw used to call you
Mr. Soggy Pants.

15:15.790 --> 15:16.530
Nuh-uh.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.240
Mr. Soggy Pants.

15:18.459 --> 15:19.950
Quit it. This is serious.

15:20.169 --> 15:22.001
Sheldon, you've got
to tell Dad that recipe.

15:22.505 --> 15:24.747
But Meemaw told me
it was a secret.

15:24.966 --> 15:27.709
If you don't, and Mom and Dad
get a divorce, it's your fault.

15:29.345 --> 15:30.051
All right.

15:30.263 --> 15:31.003
Fine.

15:32.807 --> 15:34.799
Good job, Soggy Pants.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.970
Dad, could you please
come into the living room?

15:40.523 --> 15:41.354
What for?

15:41.566 --> 15:42.682
My brain
did something impressive

15:42.900 --> 15:44.562
and I'd like to share it
with you.

15:46.028 --> 15:47.314
Hmm.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.569
What are you doing here?

15:54.996 --> 15:56.112
Same as you.

15:56.330 --> 15:58.117
I want to see
what his brain did.

15:58.332 --> 15:59.413
Please have a seat.

16:01.377 --> 16:02.584
All right.

16:06.215 --> 16:07.080
<i>Well?</i>

16:07.508 --> 16:09.545
I know Meemaw's brisket recipe.

16:09.844 --> 16:10.459
What?

16:10.678 --> 16:11.464
No, you don't.

16:11.679 --> 16:13.136
Yes, I do.

16:13.347 --> 16:15.134
And in order to bring peace
to this family,

16:15.349 --> 16:16.931
I'm prepared to make it public.

16:17.143 --> 16:17.929
You're bluffing.

16:18.144 --> 16:19.555
One tablespoon of cumin,

16:19.770 --> 16:20.760
one cup of brown sugar,

16:20.980 --> 16:22.767
two tablespoons
of smoked paprika...

16:22.982 --> 16:23.893
Okay, okay, stop.

16:24.108 --> 16:24.939
No, no, no. Keep going.

16:25.151 --> 16:26.767
How do you know
the recipe, Shelly?

16:26.986 --> 16:29.820
Meemaw told it to me
on Valentine's Day, 1982.

16:30.031 --> 16:31.818
You were out with Dad
seeing <i>Cannonball Run</i>

16:32.033 --> 16:33.149
at the dollar theater.

16:33.367 --> 16:35.654
That's impossible, you weren't
even two years old.

16:35.870 --> 16:37.406
Three tablespoons
of dried mustard,

16:37.622 --> 16:39.079
one cup of Lone Star beer...

16:39.290 --> 16:40.155
Okay.

16:41.918 --> 16:42.874
Okay.

16:43.878 --> 16:45.039
Go ahead.

16:45.630 --> 16:47.166
Give it to your father.

16:47.465 --> 16:49.001
I can write it down for you.

16:50.968 --> 16:52.334
That's okay,
I don't want it.

16:52.553 --> 16:54.761
You have got to be kidding me.

16:54.972 --> 16:56.008
Connie, you've had
every opportunity

16:56.224 --> 16:57.510
to give me that recipe
and you never did,

16:57.725 --> 16:59.307
because you've always
treated me like an outsider.

16:59.519 --> 17:00.305
No, she has not.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.601
Oh, of course I have.

17:01.812 --> 17:02.973
See? She admits it.

17:03.397 --> 17:05.012
Damn right, I do.

17:05.775 --> 17:07.983
Never thought you were good
enough for my daughter.

17:08.653 --> 17:11.145
There you were, riding around
on that dumb motorcycle,

17:11.364 --> 17:12.104
knocking her up.

17:12.323 --> 17:13.780
Why don't you kids
go in the kitchen

17:13.991 --> 17:15.277
and fix yourselves
some ice cream?

17:15.492 --> 17:16.983
I'm not going anywhere.

17:19.329 --> 17:21.195
Hey. I get it.

17:22.333 --> 17:23.493
I have a daughter.

17:23.960 --> 17:26.327
I wouldn't want her bringing
home someone like that.

17:28.005 --> 17:30.247
But I've come
a hell of a long way since then.

17:34.303 --> 17:35.760
Okay, you're right.

17:40.560 --> 17:41.425
George.

17:43.854 --> 17:45.095
I'm sorry.

17:48.234 --> 17:50.897
That means more to me
than any recipe.

17:52.613 --> 17:53.649
Come here.

18:01.163 --> 18:02.574
<i>Don't let the hug fool you.</i>

18:02.790 --> 18:06.124
<i>The minute she went home,
he made me give him the recipe.</i>

18:09.922 --> 18:13.006
Here we go, maiden voyage.

18:15.219 --> 18:17.051
Mmm, mmm.

18:17.263 --> 18:18.504
Hot damn.

18:19.765 --> 18:21.176
<i>Hot damn.</i>

18:25.313 --> 18:26.429
Hot damn!

18:26.647 --> 18:28.980
George! Language.

18:29.317 --> 18:30.057
<i>Sheldon.</i>

18:30.985 --> 18:31.691
Want some?

18:32.445 --> 18:34.562
Uh, no, thank you.
I'm not hungry.
