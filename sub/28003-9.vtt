WEBVTT

00:07.632 --> 00:09.592
[water boiling]

00:12.387 --> 00:14.806
Your brothers and sister have all
finished their oatmeal

00:14.889 --> 00:16.891
and begun their training for the day.

00:17.100 --> 00:19.060
Don't you want to join them, Number Seven?

00:20.770 --> 00:23.273
[clicks tongue]
Is someone having a tough morning?

00:23.398 --> 00:24.941
[kettle whistling]

00:26.234 --> 00:28.653
You know what cheers me up when I'm down?

00:29.237 --> 00:30.071
Singing.

00:30.864 --> 00:34.576
[singing "L'Empereur, sa femme
et le petit prince" in French]

00:48.214 --> 00:49.132
Oh!

00:50.216 --> 00:52.260
-[groans]
-[whistling fades]

00:54.220 --> 00:55.263
Number Seven!

00:55.972 --> 00:56.848
Hm.

00:58.516 --> 01:02.020
["L'Empereur, sa femme
et le petit prince" continues playing]

01:02.437 --> 01:05.148
Hi, Number Seven. I'm your new nanny,
Mrs. Cornwallis.

01:05.231 --> 01:06.274
[kettle whistling]

01:06.357 --> 01:07.525
[rattling]

01:07.609 --> 01:09.027
-[Cornwallis] Oh!
-[neck snaps]

01:09.110 --> 01:10.278
Number Seven!

01:10.361 --> 01:11.279
Hm.

01:14.574 --> 01:17.285
Bonjour. I'm Miss Stevenbaker
and I am your new nanny.

01:19.120 --> 01:20.121
[rattling]

01:20.205 --> 01:21.247
[Stevenbaker screams]

01:21.331 --> 01:22.165
Number Seven!

01:23.625 --> 01:24.501
Hm.

01:27.212 --> 01:31.091
Hello, Number Seven.
My name is Grace. I'm your new nanny.

01:31.466 --> 01:33.551
Your father tells me
you don't like oatmeal,

01:33.843 --> 01:36.137
but we need our breakfast
to grow up big and strong,

01:36.596 --> 01:39.140
and you have to train with the others
after you eat.

01:39.474 --> 01:41.309
Here, let me help you.

01:45.021 --> 01:46.898
[kettle whistling]

01:46.981 --> 01:48.608
[rattling]

01:49.818 --> 01:51.778

[eerie violin music playing]

02:20.682 --> 02:22.725
[neck cracks]

02:22.809 --> 02:23.643
Hmm.

02:32.110 --> 02:33.486
Shall we try again?

02:35.113 --> 02:37.615
Better eat that oatmeal
before it gets cold.

02:50.837 --> 02:51.880
[slurping]

02:55.592 --> 02:56.718
[door opens]
[door closes]

03:02.015 --> 03:04.934
-[sniffles]
-We're safe here for a bit.

03:05.977 --> 03:07.478
We can't stay long.

03:07.770 --> 03:09.439
We gotta pack our things.

03:11.733 --> 03:12.692
Vanya.

03:16.863 --> 03:17.906
Vanya.

03:22.744 --> 03:23.870
Let's clean you up.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.046
Your family,

03:34.255 --> 03:35.840
they'll be coming for us soon.

03:39.427 --> 03:40.261
It's okay.

03:41.095 --> 03:43.223
You don't have to worry.
We're a team now.

03:44.474 --> 03:45.850
Take the fight to them.

03:49.812 --> 03:51.481
Why would they be coming for me?

03:53.650 --> 03:56.069
[chuckles softly] Vanya...

03:57.237 --> 03:58.488
you killed Allison.

03:59.113 --> 04:00.073
No, I...

04:01.074 --> 04:02.200
I lost control.

04:05.411 --> 04:07.914
-Everything just happened so fast.
-I know.

04:08.539 --> 04:09.540
I know.

04:09.624 --> 04:12.252
It's not your fault.
You were protecting yourself.

04:12.961 --> 04:14.462
That's not how they'll see it.

04:16.714 --> 04:19.342
No. I'll-- I'll...
I'll explain it to them.

04:21.302 --> 04:25.348
Uh, I-- I just need to get to them
and I-- I need to explain it to them.

04:25.431 --> 04:26.599
They wanna hurt you.

04:27.809 --> 04:30.687
I'm the only one on your side
who understands...

04:31.229 --> 04:33.398
just how special...

04:34.399 --> 04:35.483
you truly are.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.486
I knew it the first time I met you.

04:38.569 --> 04:41.281
I see it now as I look at your face.

04:41.823 --> 04:42.949
But they don't see it.

04:43.700 --> 04:44.909
They never have.

04:46.536 --> 04:47.578
They never will.

04:52.750 --> 04:53.626
Say it.

04:58.089 --> 04:59.090
I can't.
Say it for me.

05:08.683 --> 05:09.684
I'm special.

05:12.228 --> 05:13.062
Got it.

05:14.230 --> 05:15.106
Say it again.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.152
I'm special.

05:20.069 --> 05:22.572
[chuckles] Now, that wasn't so hard.

05:26.367 --> 05:27.952
[tires screeching]

05:30.288 --> 05:33.207
-[Five] Come on! Let's go!
-[Luther] I don't think she's breathing.

05:33.291 --> 05:34.792
[Klaus] If we don't get her upstairs,
she's gonna die.

05:35.918 --> 05:37.503
[Grace] She's suffered a severe laceration
to her larynx.

05:37.587 --> 05:39.380
-One of you will need to give blood.
-[men] I will.

05:39.464 --> 05:40.673
-I will.
-I'm doing it.

05:40.757 --> 05:42.800
I'm afraid that's not possible, dear boy.

05:42.884 --> 05:45.511
Your blood is more compatible with mine.

05:45.595 --> 05:47.347
[surgical tools clattering]

05:47.430 --> 05:49.390
Hey, don't sweat it.
I-- I got this, big guy.

05:49.807 --> 05:51.893
-I-- I love needles.
-Master Klaus.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.270
Your blood is...

05:54.354 --> 05:55.229
How shall I say this?

05:55.563 --> 05:56.564
Too polluted.

05:56.647 --> 05:58.191
-Move.
-Yeah, go on.

05:58.274 --> 05:59.609
I'll do it.

06:03.029 --> 06:03.863
[whimpers]

06:03.946 --> 06:05.031
-Whoa!
-No!

06:06.908 --> 06:07.992
Stick him.

06:09.535 --> 06:10.828
[Klaus panting]

06:11.621 --> 06:14.665
-[Ben] What are you doing?
-[Klaus] Looking for drugs.

06:14.874 --> 06:16.626
[sighs] Don't do it.

06:16.709 --> 06:18.711
[Klaus] I'm done listening to you!

06:19.212 --> 06:21.381
Just go away. Go away, please.

06:21.881 --> 06:23.049
-I like the sober you.
-[fabric rips]

06:23.508 --> 06:26.427
-Yeah, well, sobriety’s overrated.
-Look where it's gotten you, though.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.012
Well, where has it gotten me?

06:28.471 --> 06:30.515
Where has it gotten me? Nowhere.

06:30.848 --> 06:34.977
I can't talk to the person I love.
People... still don't take me seriously.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.854
I wanna be numb again.

06:39.190 --> 06:40.358
You're a colossal wimp.

06:40.817 --> 06:42.819
-Oh, yeah, really?
-Yeah, really!

06:42.902 --> 06:43.861
-Hey!
-[snaps fingers]

06:43.945 --> 06:45.571
Life isn't supposed to be easy.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.365
Life is hard.

06:47.698 --> 06:49.450
Bad things happen. Good people die.

06:49.534 --> 06:52.829
Wow, playing the dead card again, huh?
You need new material, bro.

06:52.912 --> 06:54.163
I was talking about Dave.

06:54.705 --> 06:57.458
You know, I'm tired of seeing you wallow
in self-defeat.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.001
Well, then avert your gaze.

06:59.085 --> 07:00.336
You're better than that.

07:00.586 --> 07:01.587
And Dave?

07:02.130 --> 07:03.256
He knew it, too.

07:04.632 --> 07:05.925
[sighs]

07:09.846 --> 07:10.805
Yeah, you're right.

07:11.389 --> 07:14.267
You're right.
I'm-- I'm-- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

07:14.976 --> 07:15.810
Thank God.

07:16.894 --> 07:18.020
[yells] Psych!

07:18.104 --> 07:19.730
-[cackles]
-[grunts]

07:21.774 --> 07:23.860
-[pills clatter]
-Ow!

07:30.741 --> 07:32.577
You just Patrick Swayzeed me.

07:33.578 --> 07:34.871
How did you do that?

07:35.329 --> 07:37.165
Uh, I-- I didn't.

07:38.875 --> 07:39.792
You did.

07:40.751 --> 07:41.794
I think.

07:45.423 --> 07:48.634
[Diego] The bastard that nearly killed
our sister's still out there, with Vanya.

07:48.718 --> 07:51.387
-We need to go after her.
-Vanya is not important.

07:51.471 --> 07:54.724
Hey, that's your sister.
A little heartless even for you, Five.

07:54.807 --> 07:58.644
I'm not saying I don't care about her,
but if the apocalypse happens today,

07:58.728 --> 08:01.647
she dies
along with the other seven billion of us.

08:02.773 --> 08:04.567
Harold Jenkins is our first priority.

08:04.859 --> 08:07.361
-I agree. Let's go.
-You guys count me out.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.448
I mean, you know, no offense or whatever.

08:10.531 --> 08:11.866
It's just... I kind of feel

08:11.949 --> 08:15.953
like this is a whole lot of pressure
for newly-sober me, so...

08:16.037 --> 08:17.288
-You're coming.
-No, no, no.

08:17.371 --> 08:19.874
I mean, I think we can all agree
that my power's...

08:20.333 --> 08:23.503
I mean, it's pretty much useless.
I'd just be holding you guys back.

08:24.086 --> 08:25.171
Klaus, get up.

08:25.755 --> 08:26.839
You can't make me.

08:29.217 --> 08:30.343
[sighs]

08:30.593 --> 08:33.179
Oh, then again,
a little exercise couldn't hurt.

08:33.262 --> 08:34.222
Yeah.

08:34.305 --> 08:36.307
[crickets chirping]

08:37.517 --> 08:39.143
I said go!

08:39.227 --> 08:40.436
Vanya, I love you!

08:41.229 --> 08:42.396
[echoing] <i>I heard a rumor...</i>

08:42.480 --> 08:43.481
[wind whips]

08:43.564 --> 08:45.233
[gasps] No! Allison! [screams]

08:58.663 --> 08:59.664
Shit.
Oh, God.

09:30.152 --> 09:31.612
[Leonard] Vanya? Let's get goin'.

09:35.616 --> 09:36.867
Vanya, I can explain.

09:41.706 --> 09:43.791
You've been manipulating me all this time?

09:43.874 --> 09:45.126
No, that's not true.

09:45.668 --> 09:48.045
-I'm only trying to protect you.
-From who?

09:48.212 --> 09:49.589
From your family.

09:50.047 --> 09:51.674
They're the ones trying to hurt you.

09:52.174 --> 09:54.677
Vanya, it's all there, in that journal.

09:55.011 --> 09:55.845
Your father...

09:56.637 --> 09:57.888
was afraid of you.

09:59.098 --> 10:01.267
That's why he put you on those pills.

10:01.350 --> 10:02.810
It wasn't to help you.

10:03.477 --> 10:05.021
It was to hold you back.

10:06.397 --> 10:08.232
He didn't trust
that you were strong enough

10:08.316 --> 10:10.401
to control your powers.

10:11.152 --> 10:13.070
But I've never been afraid of you.

10:13.779 --> 10:14.947
I embraced you.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.783
I'm the only one

10:18.284 --> 10:20.536
who ever accepted you
for who you really are.

10:21.662 --> 10:23.623
Your brothers and your sister,

10:23.914 --> 10:26.584
they went along with him
every step of the way.

10:32.131 --> 10:33.674
Who is Harold Jenkins?

10:37.511 --> 10:38.596
[swallows]
[sighs]

10:41.599 --> 10:42.475
He's...

10:43.809 --> 10:44.894
someone like us.

10:45.394 --> 10:46.270
[sighs]

10:49.315 --> 10:50.816
A lonely boy.

10:52.318 --> 10:55.321
An outsider
whose family was cruel to him.

10:55.905 --> 10:59.325
All he ever wanted was to be heard,
to be loved.

11:03.412 --> 11:04.455
Allison was right.

11:05.164 --> 11:07.291
-You're sick.
-I'm not the one who tried to kill you.

11:07.625 --> 11:10.711
-I need to go.
-What have they ever done for you? Hm?

11:11.045 --> 11:13.089
I'm the reason that you got first chair!

11:15.132 --> 11:16.384
I auditioned. I earned the spot.

11:16.467 --> 11:20.012
[laughs] You think that the first chair
went missing all by herself?

11:22.682 --> 11:23.724
What did you do?

11:24.350 --> 11:25.976
I did this for you.

11:26.060 --> 11:28.479
-Stay away from me!
-Vanya, we are in danger.

11:29.146 --> 11:31.732
We're in danger.
Your family, they've seen you in action.

11:31.816 --> 11:33.109
They know what you're capable of.

11:33.192 --> 11:35.111
-They will come for us.
-No, they'll listen to me.

11:35.194 --> 11:37.822
No, they never will!
They want you to feel small!

11:37.905 --> 11:39.824
But they are the small ones, next to you.

11:39.907 --> 11:41.867
Compared to them, you are a god!

11:44.286 --> 11:47.623
You just needed your eyes opened
to see what they really are.

11:47.957 --> 11:49.375
I gave that to you.

11:50.084 --> 11:52.461
So... let's finish what we started.

11:53.254 --> 11:56.173
-Vanya, you need me.
-What I need is my family.

11:57.800 --> 11:58.634
I didn't...

12:00.845 --> 12:02.722
I didn't mean to kill Allison.

12:03.222 --> 12:04.140
[sighs]

12:05.182 --> 12:06.225
And I love her.

12:09.520 --> 12:10.396
And I love them.

12:13.566 --> 12:14.817
Your father was right.

12:15.234 --> 12:16.277
Not strong enough.

12:17.069 --> 12:17.945
He knew it.

12:18.863 --> 12:19.905
And now I know it.

12:21.782 --> 12:22.825
You're weak!

12:23.075 --> 12:24.034
Stop it.

12:24.577 --> 12:25.995
-You're pathetic.
-[rattling]

12:26.412 --> 12:27.538
Please don't.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.249
Look at you. You're nothing.

12:30.332 --> 12:31.417
No!

12:31.500 --> 12:33.586
-You're just ordinary.
-Stop it!

12:33.669 --> 12:35.296
-Less than ordinary!
-Stop it!

12:35.379 --> 12:37.381
-[ringing]
-[Leonard] You are not special!

12:38.007 --> 12:40.843
-Ordinary. Ordinary. Pathetic. Nothing!
-Stop it! Stop it!

12:40.926 --> 12:43.053

12:50.227 --> 12:51.061
No.

12:51.645 --> 12:53.022
No, not to me, Vanya.

12:54.398 --> 12:55.316
Please.

Please!

13:47.326 --> 13:49.453
-[toilet flushes]
-Hey, Hazel!

13:49.537 --> 13:53.123
Hey, I wasn't expecting you back so early.
But guess what I got for us--

13:53.207 --> 13:55.000
[Cha-Cha] Enjoy a free upgrade

13:55.084 --> 13:57.127
at the Rain and Quail B and B next door

13:57.211 --> 13:59.797
-for the purchase of our premium...
-[gasps]

14:00.172 --> 14:01.882
-...Atrium Pass.
-[groans]

14:02.800 --> 14:03.926
If you're here for Hazel,

14:04.260 --> 14:06.345
he's not coming. He left me.

14:07.471 --> 14:09.431
-Sure he did.
-[gasps]

14:11.308 --> 14:15.354
-It's not exactly what I was expecting.
-The understatement of the year.

14:15.437 --> 14:16.438
[Klaus] No sign of Vanya.

14:16.522 --> 14:17.731
[Diego] Let's get out of here,
before the cops come.

14:17.815 --> 14:19.191
In a minute. [sighs]

14:21.235 --> 14:23.028
[sighs, inhales sharply]

14:26.740 --> 14:30.119
-[Diego] Come on, Five, what are you...
-[Klaus] Ugh, wow.

14:30.202 --> 14:31.453
[retches]

14:31.537 --> 14:34.456
Same eye color, same pupil size.
Guys this is it.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.959
The eye I've been carrying around
for decades, it--

14:37.501 --> 14:39.295
It's found its rightful home.

14:41.505 --> 14:43.841
We got the guy we needed to kill
to stop the apocalypse.

14:43.924 --> 14:45.467
Yay! Let's go.

14:46.385 --> 14:48.929
No, no. Wait, wait. It can't be this easy.

14:49.013 --> 14:51.891
Look, this is the note that I got
from the Commission.

14:51.974 --> 14:54.101
The one that says,
"Protect Harold Jenkins,"

14:54.184 --> 14:55.853
aka Leonard Peabody.

14:56.186 --> 14:58.856
-Yeah?
-But who killed him? Who did this?

14:58.939 --> 15:00.065
I have a crazy idea.

15:00.149 --> 15:02.443
Crazy, but why don't we find Vanya...

15:02.776 --> 15:04.320
and ask her what happened?

15:05.195 --> 15:08.657
If Vanya got away from this asshole,
she might be headed back to the Academy.

15:11.660 --> 15:13.370
[heart monitor beeping]

15:14.330 --> 15:15.372
[packaging rustles]

15:15.456 --> 15:17.750
-[Luther] Is she gonna make it?
-[Grace] Yes.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.544
But her vocal cords were badly damaged.

15:22.379 --> 15:24.798
It's a miracle that, somehow,
her carotid artery wasn't severed.

15:27.092 --> 15:28.427
Will she be able to talk?

15:29.261 --> 15:30.346
It's too early to tell.

15:31.180 --> 15:34.016
[Pogo] More importantly,
thanks to you and your brothers,

15:34.808 --> 15:36.101
she's still with us.

15:40.022 --> 15:42.816
Grace and I can take it from here,
Master Luther.

15:43.567 --> 15:45.361
Go. Rest.

15:47.321 --> 15:49.657
You're the last person I would trust here.

15:53.035 --> 15:54.286
I'm not going anywhere.

16:00.125 --> 16:01.085
[sighs]

16:13.389 --> 16:14.390
[sighs]

16:17.977 --> 16:20.479
-[Five] No sign of Vanya.
-She's not in any of the rooms.

16:20.562 --> 16:21.897
She's not downstairs, either.

16:21.981 --> 16:22.940
-Well, I'm out.
-Wait.

16:23.023 --> 16:24.733
-Wait. Wait...
-Where are you going?

16:24.817 --> 16:26.860
Vanya's still out there,
and so are Hazel and Cha-Cha.

16:26.944 --> 16:29.738
I know. I'm gonna get my things
and then I'm outta here.

16:30.322 --> 16:32.366
I got some unfinished business
with those fools.

16:33.409 --> 16:34.451
[sighs]

16:36.537 --> 16:38.205
Hey, did Dad say anything

16:38.288 --> 16:39.957
about the apocalypse
when you spoke to him?

16:40.040 --> 16:41.917
-[sighs]
-Any clues as to how it happened?

16:42.001 --> 16:44.670
No. No clues. Truly terrific shave.

16:45.421 --> 16:46.422
But no clues.

16:48.340 --> 16:49.508
[sighs] Jeez.

16:49.925 --> 16:51.135
You know, come to think of it,

16:51.218 --> 16:53.137
he did mention something
about my potential,

16:53.220 --> 16:56.056
and how I've barely even scratched
the surface of my--

16:56.140 --> 16:58.642
-How did he know about the apocalypse?
-I don't know, but listen.

16:58.726 --> 17:01.020
This whole jumping through time thing
of yours, how did...

17:01.478 --> 17:03.105
How did you know how to do that?

17:03.522 --> 17:04.565
I didn't.

17:05.065 --> 17:07.151
You'd realize that
if you were actually sober.

17:07.234 --> 17:08.485
Hey, I <i>am </i>sober.

17:08.569 --> 17:11.363
I've been sober for two--
almost two days now.

17:11.447 --> 17:13.574
-Yeah, two days.
-It feels like 45 years.

17:14.533 --> 17:17.703
Who are you kidding, Klaus?
I've seen you fidgeting all day.

17:17.786 --> 17:20.080
Well, I guess we're both
fighting our addictions, then.

17:20.164 --> 17:21.874
-I'm not an addict.
-Yeah, you are.

17:22.332 --> 17:24.877
You're addicted to a drug
called the apocalypse.

17:24.960 --> 17:27.254
-You're wrong.
-First sign. Denial.

17:27.921 --> 17:30.132
-You and I, we're not the same.
-[chuckling]

17:30.215 --> 17:31.842
I've seen that look

17:31.925 --> 17:34.803
in the eye of someone
who doesn't know who they are

17:35.387 --> 17:36.764
without their high anymore.

17:36.847 --> 17:37.931
Trust me.

17:38.724 --> 17:40.434
You gotta just let it go.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.900
Figuratively, but yeah, that works, too.

17:49.276 --> 17:50.319
[sighs]

17:52.196 --> 17:53.238
One day at a time.

17:54.198 --> 17:55.449
[heart monitor beeping]

17:55.532 --> 17:58.243
I know that peaceful dark place
you're in right now.

18:01.872 --> 18:04.792
And I know the pain you'll be in
when you leave it and wake up...

18:05.209 --> 18:07.252
to someone that's not quite you anymore.

18:17.012 --> 18:18.055
When I woke up,
I was angry.

18:22.893 --> 18:26.230
I was angry that you were gone,
that you'd moved on with your life.

18:28.023 --> 18:32.152
And I was still stuck here,
alone with Dad in this shitty old house.

18:34.154 --> 18:35.322
But I was wrong,

18:35.405 --> 18:38.367
because I pushed everyone away,
and...

18:42.496 --> 18:45.624
[crying] ...that's including
the one person I love with all my heart.

18:51.797 --> 18:52.840
[sniffles]

18:55.717 --> 18:57.219
Allison, I'm so sorry.

18:59.346 --> 19:01.056
I'm so sorry I wasn't there.

19:02.599 --> 19:04.434
And I won't let you wake up alone.

19:07.354 --> 19:08.355
[blender whirs]

19:10.023 --> 19:11.817
Well, do you think we really did it?

19:12.693 --> 19:14.820
Think we actually stopped the apocalypse?

19:14.903 --> 19:17.990
[jazz music playing on radio]

19:18.323 --> 19:19.241
Now what?

19:21.869 --> 19:22.786
I don't know.
[chuckles]

19:25.372 --> 19:26.999
I'm open to suggestion.

19:27.916 --> 19:29.418
[knocking at door]

19:30.252 --> 19:32.171
Eh, I'll get it. [sighs]

19:36.884 --> 19:38.552
-[sighs]
-Hey, old-timer.

19:39.595 --> 19:41.346
Do you have my sister? And...

19:42.055 --> 19:43.807
if not, would you like a margarita?

19:46.476 --> 19:47.311
Come on.

19:52.774 --> 19:53.942
You're here to kill me?

19:55.694 --> 19:58.614
Oh. Shit. Sorry. Old habits.

19:59.489 --> 20:02.618
Well, I can understand
why you might feel that way, you know...

20:03.827 --> 20:06.371
Well, you attacked our house,
tried to kill my family,

20:06.455 --> 20:07.956
and kidnapped my brother.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.875
Well, there's not much
I can do about the past.

20:09.958 --> 20:11.543
I'm not the only killer in this room.

20:11.627 --> 20:13.545
You got your own bloody history, pal.

20:14.504 --> 20:15.464
Speaking of which,

20:16.840 --> 20:19.176
that job you did in Calhoun,
that shit's legendary.

20:19.259 --> 20:22.095
Can't believe I'm actually sittin' here
talkin' to you, after all--

20:22.179 --> 20:23.639
Hazel, why are you here?

20:24.223 --> 20:25.349
Well, I'm, you know--
-[grunts]
-Diego, stop!

20:27.643 --> 20:29.269
-[Diego] Get up!
-[groans]

20:30.354 --> 20:33.690
You know, before you kill him,
you might wanna hear what he has to say.

20:35.692 --> 20:37.819
I'm gonna kill you
for what you did to Patch.

20:37.903 --> 20:39.029
[yells]

20:39.112 --> 20:40.739
Or don't. See how that goes.

20:40.822 --> 20:42.115
-[Hazel] Are you gonna--
-[yells]

20:42.199 --> 20:43.450
Come on!

-[screams]
-[inhales sharply]

20:46.411 --> 20:47.621

-[both yelling]

21:05.264 --> 21:07.266
[Hazel groaning]

21:07.683 --> 21:09.393
[Five] I draw the line at biting.

21:10.018 --> 21:11.270
[spits]

21:11.561 --> 21:14.898
Hazel, whatever you came here to say,
I suggest you make it quick,

21:15.440 --> 21:16.650
before he comes round.

21:17.234 --> 21:19.945
I left my partner, quit the Commission,
came to volunteer.

21:20.654 --> 21:23.198
-For what?
-To help stop the apocalypse.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.158
[chuckles] Hm.

21:25.534 --> 21:27.911
What on earth could be so funny
to you right now?

21:27.995 --> 21:30.497
Before I answer that,
why do you wanna help us?

21:31.415 --> 21:34.418
Let's just say I have a vested interest
in a doughnut shop.

21:34.501 --> 21:37.629
Well, I hate to break it to you, pal,
but you're a day late and a dollar short.

21:37.879 --> 21:40.590
The fact that you're here right now
means, without a shadow of a doubt,

21:40.674 --> 21:42.426
that the apocalypse is over.
Really? How do you know?

21:44.761 --> 21:47.556
The mark is dead. Found him this morning.

21:47.973 --> 21:50.642
You were the last known unknown left
in the equation.

21:51.351 --> 21:53.687
[chuckles] Shit. Really?

21:54.271 --> 21:57.983
Mm-hmm. And if you're out,
then Hellrider ain't riding.

21:59.484 --> 22:01.653
Oh! [breathes deeply]

22:02.279 --> 22:03.196
All right.

22:03.655 --> 22:04.948
[laughs]

22:05.991 --> 22:06.825
Oh!

22:07.868 --> 22:08.952
[sighs]
[exhales]

22:12.914 --> 22:14.624
[chuckles] Mm.

22:15.834 --> 22:17.085
Oh!

22:19.004 --> 22:19.838
[sighs]

22:21.214 --> 22:22.132
So now what?

22:22.841 --> 22:24.634
You know, to be honest, I don't know.

22:25.927 --> 22:28.180
I've been chasing this thing
for so long, I...

22:28.722 --> 22:31.600
I never really thought
about the day after. [chuckles]

22:32.642 --> 22:33.977
I don't know. What about you?

22:34.061 --> 22:35.979
I'm done with all this madness.

22:37.314 --> 22:38.732
Time to start over.

22:39.024 --> 22:40.275
You should do the same.

22:41.318 --> 22:42.903
That's easier said than done.

22:43.945 --> 22:45.489
It doesn't have to be hard.

22:45.989 --> 22:48.867
I mean, think about it like this.
If you never time traveled,

22:48.950 --> 22:51.370
you never got caught up with the Handler,

22:51.912 --> 22:53.205
what would have happened?

22:57.376 --> 23:00.045
I guess I would have grown up to be
an emotionally stunted man-child

23:00.128 --> 23:01.755
like everybody else around here.

23:01.838 --> 23:03.924
[chuckles softly] Well, there you go.

23:04.841 --> 23:06.093
Now you can grow up.

23:07.594 --> 23:08.595
Good luck.

23:12.766 --> 23:13.850
Hazel.

23:14.434 --> 23:16.812
-One more thing before you go.
-Shoot.

23:17.562 --> 23:20.315
Which one of you was the trigger man
for Detective Patch?

23:20.857 --> 23:21.900
Trigger woman.

23:22.526 --> 23:23.443
[sighs]

23:23.944 --> 23:25.362
Huh. That's too bad.

23:25.862 --> 23:27.906
That gun could have cleared
my brother's name.

23:29.491 --> 23:32.369
Well, today's your lucky day, amigo.

23:32.994 --> 23:35.122
Take 'em both. [sighs]

23:35.205 --> 23:36.957
I'm done with this life.

26:47.022 --> 26:48.523
They were both there that night.

26:48.607 --> 26:51.860

And he happened to have in his possession

27:03.038 --> 27:05.665
the one thing
that could do our family a little good.

27:06.207 --> 27:08.335

27:20.388 --> 27:22.057

27:24.851 --> 27:25.977
A lot of things.

27:27.896 --> 27:29.606
Cute butt. Nice legs.

27:30.565 --> 27:32.776
Anything a little more profound than that?

27:35.111 --> 27:36.404
She believed in people.

27:37.614 --> 27:40.533
No matter how much shit
and filth she saw on the streets.

27:41.618 --> 27:43.203

27:45.288 --> 27:47.666
Well, I'm sure she'll be proud to know

29:07.579 --> 29:09.038
We got in an argument.

29:10.832 --> 29:12.333
And things got out of control.

29:15.295 --> 29:16.629
I didn't mean to hurt her.

why is this so far-fetched?

If you're right, then maybe
she's the one who killed Peabody.

It's not difficult to accept,
it's impossible to accept.

No, he's right. Look,
we can't keep her locked up without proof.

and ask her?

No, she's not goin' anywhere.

32:06.424 --> 32:09.510
No, even if you're right,
she needs our help,

32:09.594 --> 32:11.721
and we can't do that
if she's locked in a cage.

40:37.101 --> 40:38.561
Even after all these years.

40:39.520 --> 40:41.021
Afraid of our power.

40:42.022 --> 40:43.232
You're not real.

40:43.315 --> 40:44.483
We killed Leonard.
Because he lied to us.

40:48.612 --> 40:50.072
Not about everything.

40:50.781 --> 40:52.366
What are you talking about?

40:52.450 --> 40:53.534
You know.

40:54.034 --> 40:55.327
You've always known.

40:56.328 --> 40:57.663
Our brothers and sister,
they're just like Dad,

41:01.000 --> 41:02.501
driven to keep us down,

41:03.127 --> 41:04.336
a muted voice,

41:04.420 --> 41:05.921
isolated from the group,

41:06.005 --> 41:07.047
never in the limelight,

41:07.131 --> 41:09.091
never the center of attention.

41:09.758 --> 41:10.926
It will never end.

41:12.636 --> 41:13.929
Not until we act.

41:16.974 --> 41:18.184
But they're our family.

41:18.267 --> 41:21.437
They fear you now.
They're gonna keep you in here forever.

41:22.104 --> 41:22.980
No.

41:23.939 --> 41:25.566
Do you remember what that was like?

41:26.609 --> 41:30.112
Staring at these gray walls,
hour after hour,

41:30.196 --> 41:33.616
day after day while they played together?

41:34.742 --> 41:35.910
Do you want to live like this

41:35.993 --> 41:38.287
-for the rest of our lives?
-[sobbing] No. No.

41:40.247 --> 41:41.624
[crying]

41:44.752 --> 41:46.003
[gasping]

41:46.504 --> 41:48.797
[wheezing] I can't breathe in here.

41:49.590 --> 41:52.718
[sobbing] I can't breathe in here.

41:52.801 --> 41:53.969
Then do something about it.

41:55.596 --> 41:56.722
Embrace who we are.

41:56.805 --> 41:58.265
-[heart beating]
-I can't--

41:59.308 --> 42:01.101
Who we've been all along.

42:02.353 --> 42:03.312
[sighs]

42:03.687 --> 42:05.689
[heart beating faster]

42:15.282 --> 42:17.535
[heart racing]

42:18.118 --> 42:19.203
[gasps]

42:35.678 --> 42:38.389
-[gasping]
-[heartbeat slowing]

42:40.975 --> 42:43.018
[wind whistling]

42:49.191 --> 42:51.735
-[sighs]
-[high-pitched whistling]

42:55.614 --> 42:57.575
[metal squeals]

43:01.996 --> 43:03.664
[creaking]

43:03.747 --> 43:05.165
[crashing]

43:05.249 --> 43:06.375
[creaking]

43:07.084 --> 43:08.294
Oh, my God.

43:14.967 --> 43:16.969
[sounds resonating]

43:19.805 --> 43:21.432
[sounds reverberating]
