JAMIE: A decade ago,
the animal population mutated,

00:03.737 --> 00:06.040
endangering human
life on the planet.

00:06.074 --> 00:08.609
A group of us managed
to cure the animals...

00:08.642 --> 00:09.610
An animal expert,

00:09.643 --> 00:11.079
a veterinary pathologist,

00:11.112 --> 00:12.613
an Army Ranger,

00:12.646 --> 00:13.681
a doctor,

00:13.714 --> 00:14.582
a mercenary,

00:14.615 --> 00:16.484
and me,
an investigative journalist.

00:16.517 --> 00:19.453
But a secretive group
called The Shepherds

00:19.487 --> 00:21.522
released a gas that
sterilized all of humanity.

00:21.555 --> 00:24.458
Our lead scientist was
killed trying to stop them,

00:24.492 --> 00:26.127
so our team disbanded.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.629
Ten years later,
his daughter has returned,

00:28.662 --> 00:29.839
believing he may still be alive.

00:29.863 --> 00:32.732
With the world trying to
solve the sterility problem,

00:32.766 --> 00:35.369
a new threat has emerged...
The hybrids...

00:35.403 --> 00:38.339
Lab-made creatures that
threatened the West Coast.

00:38.372 --> 00:39.773
A massive barrier
was constructed

00:39.807 --> 00:42.410
to protect the rest
of North America.

00:42.443 --> 00:44.212
So we battle on many fronts,

00:44.245 --> 00:46.747
some of us searching
for a cure to sterility,

00:46.780 --> 00:49.250
while others try to save
as many lives as possible

00:49.283 --> 00:50.784
in the hybrid zone.

00:59.293 --> 01:02.730

TESSA: Roger, roger.

01:16.410 --> 01:18.479
Sending the penguins
to the igloo.

01:18.512 --> 01:20.448
Penguins? Really?

01:20.481 --> 01:22.516
Just trying to keep it
spicy, babe.

01:22.550 --> 01:25.619
You know, I'm pretty sure that
penguins don't live in igloos.

01:25.653 --> 01:27.721
Wrong. I've seen it.

01:27.755 --> 01:29.823

01:29.857 --> 01:31.792

there, little man.

I want to go home.

01:41.302 --> 01:42.803
Yeah, I hear that,
but, uh, I'm afraid

01:42.836 --> 01:44.472
that's not an option right
now, okay?

01:44.505 --> 01:46.707
But we're gonna find you
and your family a new home.

somewhere beyond the barrier.

this whole time?

12:34.554 --> 12:35.422
Hard to say.

12:35.455 --> 12:39.026
ABRAHAM: Here, let me.

12:39.059 --> 12:41.228
What is all this?

12:41.261 --> 12:42.930
Abe has a theory

12:42.963 --> 12:44.865
on how to reverse the
effects of the TX-gas.

12:44.898 --> 12:46.233
Restart procreation.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.401
He's trying to separate
something in the, um,

12:48.435 --> 12:51.471
the NLRP2 protein.

12:51.504 --> 12:53.173
You're doing that research here?

12:53.206 --> 12:55.075
DARIELA: He was at U of M,

12:55.108 --> 12:57.777
Ann Arbor,
one of their top researchers.

12:59.279 --> 13:03.050
But, um, he's actually made
great breakthroughs here.

13:03.083 --> 13:06.053
I've made some advancements,
not breakthroughs.

13:06.086 --> 13:07.855
Anyway, that's irrelevant.

13:07.888 --> 13:10.590
These are the breakthroughs
that matter now.

13:10.623 --> 13:14.862
So, this is the facility
he's being held in.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.596
It's been abandoned for years,

13:16.629 --> 13:19.199
but this shows continuous
electricity usage

13:19.232 --> 13:21.401
in the eastern wing.

13:21.434 --> 13:22.936
That must be where he is.

13:22.970 --> 13:24.404
How did you get all this?

13:24.437 --> 13:27.975
She stole it from the IADG.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.518
ABRAHAM: Why would
you not just tell them

13:29.542 --> 13:31.078
you are Mitch's daughter?

13:31.111 --> 13:32.980
I'm sure they would
welcome you on the mission.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.848
Safe behind the border wall.

13:34.882 --> 13:37.885
I'm sure you think
the IADG are heroes,

13:37.918 --> 13:40.287
but something seems
off about this mission.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.290
We need to go ourselves
without the IADG.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.567
DARIELA: Well,
that's gonna be tough.

13:44.591 --> 13:45.893
Your intel is incomplete.

13:45.926 --> 13:47.494
None of these have
an entrance marked.

13:47.527 --> 13:48.862
That's why I'm here.

13:48.896 --> 13:51.298
I need your help and fast.

13:51.331 --> 13:54.001
The IADG is on their way
to get my father right now.

13:54.034 --> 13:56.303
We have to get there first.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.387
MEYERS: It's him.

14:14.421 --> 14:16.356
It's Mitch Morgan.

14:20.093 --> 14:21.962
TECH: Look at his scars.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.997
The tank must've
regenerated his wounds.

14:24.031 --> 14:24.797
It's incredible.

14:24.831 --> 14:26.333
All right,
let's just load him up.

14:26.366 --> 14:27.367
Get him out of here

14:27.400 --> 14:29.202
before we get company.

14:29.236 --> 14:31.504
We can't. Our specs were wrong.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.941
What?

14:33.974 --> 14:34.984
His life support's
being provided

14:35.008 --> 14:36.276
by the tank's power source.

14:36.309 --> 14:37.477
No battery pack.

14:37.510 --> 14:38.545
We move it, he'll die.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.281
We'll have to pull
him out first.

site in Poland

22:18.505 --> 22:20.072
that shared the same structure.

hangar is the entrance.

22:25.712 --> 22:27.146
as your intel suggests,

22:27.179 --> 22:29.949
we need to enter
through this hangar,

22:29.982 --> 22:31.384
find an unmarked set of stairs,

22:31.418 --> 22:32.519

22:32.552 --> 22:33.420

We need to make sure
we enter the hangar

22:35.054 --> 22:36.523

22:36.556 --> 22:38.658

That's how we get in.

I'll call Emma,
see if she can stay with Isaac.

22:47.099 --> 22:48.911
If we don't hear from Jamie,
we'll head to the airport

we didn't have the best childhoods.

23:16.929 --> 23:17.997

Does Abe know you're calling?

23:46.258 --> 23:47.627
No.

23:47.660 --> 23:49.562
But I have some research
you need to see.

23:53.633 --> 23:56.803
JAMIE: You know,
this is private property.

23:56.836 --> 23:59.806
And this is a warrant.

23:59.839 --> 24:02.942
We've gotten reports of a

24:23.630 --> 24:24.664
Yes, sir.

24:39.746 --> 24:41.748
I warned you, Jamie.

24:44.917 --> 24:47.153
You have to stop this.

24:47.186 --> 24:48.531
Well, I'm not your
girlfriend anymore,

24:48.555 --> 24:50.189
so what I do isn't
really your concern.

24:50.222 --> 24:51.399
It is when you're
breaking the law.

24:51.423 --> 24:54.561
The Shepherds created a gas
that sterilized the planet.

24:54.594 --> 24:57.730
They created hybrid animals
that murdered our friends.

24:57.764 --> 24:58.598
There's no Shepherds left.

24:58.631 --> 24:59.942
Their leadership has
all been arrested,

24:59.966 --> 25:01.267
and the rest have scattered.

25:01.300 --> 25:03.570
They're not a threat.
Yeah, thanks to me.

25:03.603 --> 25:06.272
But one of their leaders
is still out there.

25:06.305 --> 25:08.608
The Falcon.
And they are planning something big,

25:08.641 --> 25:10.052
something worse than
we've ever seen.

25:10.076 --> 25:12.311
So if bending the rules is
what it takes to stop them,

25:12.344 --> 25:14.547
sign me up.
Then you're no better than them.

25:14.581 --> 25:15.624
The last Shepherd
that you chased

25:15.648 --> 25:16.916
ended up dead, remember?

25:16.949 --> 25:18.317
What are you gonna
do, arrest me?

25:18.350 --> 25:20.286
If I have to. Great.
I'm sure the NYPD

25:20.319 --> 25:22.655

working with a criminal.

25:29.929 --> 25:32.198
I always have.

25:35.101 --> 25:36.969
I always will.

25:37.003 --> 25:38.705

Do you know what I
had to do to get that?

25:48.681 --> 25:50.182
It's over.

25:50.216 --> 25:54.320
Tell the NYPD whatever you
want, but if I catch you again,

25:54.353 --> 25:55.888
I will bring you in.

25:57.690 --> 25:58.958
You're bluffing.

25:58.991 --> 26:01.227
I'm not. Don't make me prove it.

26:20.079 --> 26:23.049
My name is Lieutenant Myers.

26:23.082 --> 26:25.918
Of the International
Animal Defense Group.

26:25.952 --> 26:28.655
IADG.

26:28.688 --> 26:30.256
We know what a
traumatic experience

26:30.289 --> 26:32.759
this has been for you,
and we know that you're eager

26:32.792 --> 26:34.302
to get back to your
family and friends.

26:34.326 --> 26:35.995
We're just running a few tests

26:36.028 --> 26:39.666
to make sure that you're
stable enough to travel.

26:39.699 --> 26:40.933
How does that sound?

26:43.135 --> 26:45.104
Great.

26:45.137 --> 26:47.006
Okay, let's begin.

26:47.039 --> 26:49.776
Do you know what year it is?

26:55.982 --> 26:57.650
Do you know where you are?

27:03.355 --> 27:04.991
That's just warm saline.

27:05.024 --> 27:07.193
We need to raise your
body temperature.

27:09.261 --> 27:12.899
Do you remember
how you got here?

27:12.932 --> 27:15.401
Are you not answering because
you don't know the answer,

27:15.434 --> 27:18.170
or because y-you don't
understand what I'm saying?

27:20.773 --> 27:23.275
All right. Um...

27:23.309 --> 27:25.377
Hey, look.
We'll try something else.

27:25.411 --> 27:30.316
Tap your, your left hand...

27:30.349 --> 27:32.118
(touches hand)

27:32.151 --> 27:34.020
for "yes,"

27:34.053 --> 27:36.288
and tap your right hand

27:36.322 --> 27:37.790
for "no."

27:39.792 --> 27:41.193
It's like this.

27:48.901 --> 27:51.037
Do you know what year it is?

27:53.072 --> 27:56.308
Do you know where you are?

27:56.342 --> 27:58.077
Do you know your name?

28:35.447 --> 28:37.249
(children laughing)

28:49.962 --> 28:51.964
How you doing, buddy?

28:51.998 --> 28:52.531
Good. Now.

28:52.564 --> 28:54.300
Good, good.

28:54.333 --> 28:56.368
Well, if you get lost,
or you have any questions,

28:56.402 --> 28:57.770
just ask, okay?

28:59.571 --> 29:03.075
That thing you used
to control the lions.

29:03.109 --> 29:05.244
How does it work?

29:05.277 --> 29:07.513
This?

29:07.546 --> 29:09.348
(clears throat)

29:09.381 --> 29:11.951
Well, um...

29:11.984 --> 29:14.020
want to know a secret?

29:15.888 --> 29:19.826
This is just a toothpick holder.

29:19.859 --> 29:21.794
I control the
lions with my mind.

29:21.828 --> 29:23.963
Yeah, right.

29:23.996 --> 29:25.965
(laughs softly)

29:25.998 --> 29:28.000
Yeah, yeah, you got me.

29:28.034 --> 29:31.003
I have some friends
who are scientists,

29:31.037 --> 29:32.404
they developed it for me.

29:32.438 --> 29:35.007
It's, uh, part radio,
part computer, and really,

29:35.041 --> 29:37.543
I'm not sure how it works.
I'm just glad it does.

29:37.576 --> 29:40.813
You know, maybe one of these
days, I'll let you try it.

29:40.847 --> 29:42.157
Cool. All right,
I'll catch you later.

29:42.181 --> 29:43.415
I got to do a thing.

29:58.330 --> 30:02.168
MAN: All perimeter
details, contact.

30:06.906 --> 30:09.075
Update status.

30:11.944 --> 30:13.145
Here for the hybrid?

30:13.179 --> 30:15.014
MAN: Update status.

30:17.049 --> 30:19.385
(gate opening)

30:19.418 --> 30:22.088
MAN: IADG coming through.

30:25.424 --> 30:29.028
The IADG has been looking
for you for a long time.

30:32.564 --> 30:35.401
You were last seen on
the island of Pangaea,

30:35.434 --> 30:37.236
ten years ago.

30:41.373 --> 30:43.409
We're here to help you.

30:43.442 --> 30:46.112
But you have to trust us, okay?

30:55.354 --> 30:57.423
The pen.

30:57.456 --> 30:58.590
You want the pen.

30:58.624 --> 31:00.259
Yeah, yeah.

31:02.594 --> 31:04.596
Here.

31:15.541 --> 31:17.910
That's good, take your time.

31:20.279 --> 31:22.581
That's good.

31:22.614 --> 31:24.917
It's all right. It's okay.

31:24.951 --> 31:27.653
It's okay, take your time.

31:27.686 --> 31:29.421
(exhales)

31:51.710 --> 31:52.911
What-what is that?

31:55.314 --> 31:57.149

What does that mean?

31:57.183 --> 31:59.185

32:02.121 --> 32:03.801
W-What does that mean?
What does that mean?

And you know that.

33:25.504 --> 33:27.106
Not according to the IADG.

33:27.139 --> 33:28.374
I have their files.

I have proof.

No, I can't.

33:34.446 --> 33:36.348
Okay?

33:36.382 --> 33:37.683
I can't do this again.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.619
I went to Pangaea, Clem.

33:40.652 --> 33:43.355
I-I spent years chasing
down every lead,

33:43.389 --> 33:44.523
hoping against hope

33:44.556 --> 33:46.658
that, that Mitch would
still be out there

33:46.692 --> 33:49.161
and alive somewhere j-just
waiting for us to find him,

33:49.195 --> 33:51.397
but you know what? He never was.

33:51.430 --> 33:52.664
It's real this time.

33:52.698 --> 33:54.433
I promise.

33:54.466 --> 33:57.269
And I know there's a part
of you that believes me,

33:57.303 --> 34:00.139
that never stopped believing.

34:00.172 --> 34:03.109
And if I'm right,
can you really risk not being there

34:03.142 --> 34:05.043
when we find him?

Abraham, I'm sorry.

35:14.846 --> 35:17.683
You were going to
sneak off without us.

35:17.716 --> 35:19.285
I don't understand.

35:19.318 --> 35:22.288
You and Dariela
have a home here.

35:22.321 --> 35:23.555
You have Isaac.

35:23.589 --> 35:25.791
He needs you more than I do.

35:25.824 --> 35:27.259
I can't let you go alone.

35:27.293 --> 35:29.895
It's too dangerous. You...

35:29.928 --> 35:32.698
This isn't up for discussion.

35:32.731 --> 35:35.601
You are not telling us
everything, Clementine.

35:36.868 --> 35:39.171
The little girl I
knew would never

35:39.205 --> 35:41.807
pull a gun on... People change.

35:46.612 --> 35:48.947
Clementine!

35:48.980 --> 35:50.148
(engine starts)

36:05.231 --> 36:08.467
This one is a 90% match
to the alchemical symbol

36:08.500 --> 36:10.269
that represents 24 hours.

36:12.771 --> 36:18.277
And this one is a 72%
match for the Indian rupee.

36:18.310 --> 36:19.945
Still trying to find the rest.

36:19.978 --> 36:22.348
Well, maybe it's... it's a code.

36:22.381 --> 36:23.882
No, no, it's gibberish.

36:23.915 --> 36:26.285
He can't help us.
(Mitch pounds table)

36:48.274 --> 36:50.342
Proof? Proof.

36:51.810 --> 36:53.279
He wants proof.

36:57.283 --> 36:58.717
No, he's not ready.

36:58.750 --> 36:59.951
He's ready.

37:06.024 --> 37:07.693
Okay, look.

37:07.726 --> 37:09.328
Dr. Morgan,

37:09.361 --> 37:11.038
I'm afraid this is gonna
come as a shock to you,

37:11.062 --> 37:12.564
but there's somebody here

37:12.598 --> 37:14.700
who's been waiting
to talk to you.

37:27.879 --> 37:30.015
I can't believe you
just let her go.

37:30.048 --> 37:31.483
It's not like I had a choice.

37:31.517 --> 37:33.419
Look, we'll just have
to catch up with her.

37:36.054 --> 37:37.989
What the...? (squishing)

37:38.023 --> 37:39.024
What is that?

37:39.057 --> 37:40.526
It's a sample of the new hybrid

37:40.559 --> 37:41.559
Jackson sent me.

37:42.861 --> 37:44.863
But it was just a
few drops of blood.

37:44.896 --> 37:47.032
It's growing.

37:47.065 --> 37:48.900
Yes.

37:48.934 --> 37:50.702
But into what?

37:54.072 --> 37:56.742
(sighs) Do we really have
the rest of the night off?

37:56.775 --> 37:58.444
Mmm. Don't jinx it.

37:58.477 --> 38:01.046
We were out for ten
days with that group.

38:01.079 --> 38:04.049
I'm gonna sleep for
eight straight hours.

38:06.117 --> 38:09.721
Would you settle for six?

38:09.755 --> 38:12.724
I could be convinced
to settle for six.

38:16.728 --> 38:18.830
(lock buzzes)

38:18.864 --> 38:20.999
(indistinct chatter over radio)

38:22.901 --> 38:24.102
Hey.

38:24.135 --> 38:27.673
I need to know what's on that
drive, ASAP.

38:27.706 --> 38:29.708
Somebody went through a
lot of trouble to get that.

38:29.741 --> 38:32.010
TESSA: Who's with
the fancy coat?

38:32.043 --> 38:33.945
Is that the IADG investigator?

38:33.979 --> 38:35.113
She got here fast.

38:35.146 --> 38:37.416
She's leaving even faster. Hey!

38:37.449 --> 38:38.517
Excuse me, miss?

38:41.853 --> 38:44.723
I'll get started on it right
away, Detective.

38:44.756 --> 38:46.858
In fact,
if you bring me a coffee,

38:46.892 --> 38:48.727
it'll be ready
when you get back.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.462
Deal.

39:14.920 --> 39:16.588
(rapid beeping)

39:26.164 --> 39:27.799
(people screaming)

39:44.550 --> 39:46.718
Where are Abe and Dariela?

39:46.752 --> 39:49.154
Isaac got sick.
They had to take care of him.

39:49.187 --> 39:50.489
They'll meet up with us later.

39:51.657 --> 39:52.858
You look different.

39:56.628 --> 39:58.730
It's been awhile.

40:12.578 --> 40:13.912
Well, here goes nothing.

40:15.547 --> 40:18.183
Come on in.
We'll be wheels up in five.

40:19.985 --> 40:20.986
(phone vibrates)

40:29.695 --> 40:30.929
Oh.

40:41.573 --> 40:43.074
WOMAN: Hi.

40:45.076 --> 40:48.179
Are you sure that you
don't need anything?

40:48.213 --> 40:50.616
Food or-or water?

40:52.250 --> 40:56.154
Water, you've...
you've had enough water for a lifetime.

40:58.156 --> 41:00.225
I'm sure that you
have questions.

41:00.258 --> 41:01.960
I... (sniffles)

41:01.993 --> 41:05.497
I had a lot, too.

41:05.531 --> 41:07.232
When they first told
me they found you,

41:07.265 --> 41:09.267
I couldn't believe it.

41:09.300 --> 41:12.003
And... part of me still doesn't,

41:12.037 --> 41:15.173
but... (sniffles) here you are.

41:20.879 --> 41:22.848
We're together again.

41:25.116 --> 41:27.586
It's going to be okay, Dad.

41:30.188 --> 41:33.625
You recognize me now, don't you?

41:33.659 --> 41:36.227
It's me.

41:36.261 --> 41:38.897
Your daughter.

41:38.930 --> 41:41.499
Clementine.

41:42.668 --> 41:44.169
Clem.
