00:12.923 --> 00:16.603
Tonight, I wear a hat...

00:16.603 --> 00:19.683
Richard wears a hat...

00:19.683 --> 00:22.603
and James wears a hat.

00:28.363 --> 00:30.403
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:30.403 --> 00:34.283
Hello, everybody. Hello and welcome.

00:34.283 --> 00:36.963
Welcome. Thank you so much.

00:36.963 --> 00:38.083
Now...

00:39.283 --> 00:43.203
Now, we start tonight with a letter.

00:43.203 --> 00:48.123
It's from a chap called
Alan Massive Liar and it says,

00:48.123 --> 00:50.603
"Dear Jez, Dick and Jim,

00:50.603 --> 00:52.803
"I want a convertible supercar,

00:52.803 --> 00:57.683
"but I only have Â£113,500 to spend.

00:57.763 --> 00:59.163
"Can you help?"

00:59.163 --> 01:01.283
This is very timely, actually,

01:01.283 --> 01:05.322
because as it happens,
no, we can't.

01:09.963 --> 01:13.643
This is the new Audi R8 V10 Spyder,

01:13.643 --> 01:18.683
which in this spec, costs Â£113,500.

01:22.123 --> 01:25.723
And this is the new Porsche 911
Turbo convertible,

01:25.723 --> 01:31.523
which, to all intents and purposes,
costs Â£113,500.

01:33.043 --> 01:36.323
If it's speed you're after, the Audi
looks like the better bet

01:36.323 --> 01:40.283
because it is
much, much more powerful.

01:40.283 --> 01:43.443
But because the Porsche
is so much lighter,

01:43.443 --> 01:48.683
they both produce exactly
306 brake horsepower per tonne.

01:48.683 --> 01:52.963
If they were supermarkets,
you'd do them for price fixing.

01:54.203 --> 01:55.763
There's more, too.

01:55.763 --> 01:59.323
They're both German,
they're both four-wheel drive,

01:59.323 --> 02:03.803
and they both have hoods made from
cloth rather than metal.

02:03.803 --> 02:07.843
So let's see if they can be split
in a drag race.

02:09.043 --> 02:11.002
Right, some numbers.

02:11.002 --> 02:17.603
I have a Lamborghini 5.2 litre V10,
and I'm up against

02:17.603 --> 02:20.043
Porsche's brand-new 3.8 litre,

02:20.043 --> 02:24.683
twin turbocharged,
direct-injected flat six.

02:25.683 --> 02:27.883
This should be interesting.

02:27.883 --> 02:30.163
Three, two, one!

02:30.163 --> 02:31.203
Go!

02:33.283 --> 02:36.203
And indeed, it is interesting.

02:37.203 --> 02:40.403
Ironman's heavy weight iron car

02:40.403 --> 02:45.723
is losing to the lightweight
one with the iron lung.

02:47.923 --> 02:52.763
But now let's see what happens if we
swap drivers and do the race again.

02:52.763 --> 02:54.763
Go!

02:57.203 --> 02:59.163
Oh no!

02:59.163 --> 03:02.763
'Embarrassingly, this time round,
the Audi was victorious.'

03:06.043 --> 03:08.283
The reason that happened is simple.

03:08.283 --> 03:13.603
Four-wheel-drive cars like
these are notoriously difficult
to get off the line quickly.

03:13.603 --> 03:15.643
If you do it well,
you're going to win.

03:15.643 --> 03:17.883
If you do it badly,
you're going to lose.

03:17.883 --> 03:21.283
So really, in short race like that,
it's all down to the driver.

03:21.283 --> 03:25.483
The cars, predictably,
almost exactly the same.

03:28.923 --> 03:32.563
They both do 0-60
in around four seconds.

03:34.643 --> 03:39.883
And flat out, they can both
crack 190 miles an hour.

03:41.323 --> 03:44.723
So in a straight line, there's
nothing to choose between them.

03:44.723 --> 03:46.483
But what about in the corners?

03:52.643 --> 03:57.843
Well, it's the same story here
because they both have
the same problem.

04:01.403 --> 04:04.283
You see, a normal car
like this is strong,

04:04.283 --> 04:06.883
because the two ends
are connected together

04:06.883 --> 04:10.363
by a roof and a floor -
two pieces of metal.

04:10.363 --> 04:12.523
If you take the roof away,

04:12.523 --> 04:15.043
you end up with
a big heavy engine here,

04:15.043 --> 04:19.963
connected to the steering and
suspension gubbins there
by just the floor.

04:19.963 --> 04:23.883
It's like having two bricks
joined together by a playing card -

04:23.883 --> 04:25.603
it's going to be all wobbly.

04:30.323 --> 04:31.963
To get round the problem,

04:31.963 --> 04:36.003
Audi has fitted the Spyder
with lots of strengthening beams.

04:38.843 --> 04:44.043
Now that sounds fine, but it's
added 100 kilograms to the weight.

04:45.363 --> 04:49.043
Porsche meanwhile offers
the turbo with active engine mounts,

04:49.043 --> 04:51.763
which make the engine part of
the car's backbone.

04:51.763 --> 04:55.043
It sounds intriguing,
but has it worked?

04:55.043 --> 04:56.923
In a word, yes.

05:00.963 --> 05:07.123
This is a million times better than
the old 911 turbo convertible.

05:08.843 --> 05:11.883
Mind you, that isn't saying much,

05:11.883 --> 05:15.163
because other things that are a
million times nicer than the old car

05:15.163 --> 05:17.843
include tuberculosis.

05:19.043 --> 05:21.843
And being on fire. Stuff like that.

05:24.003 --> 05:27.523
However, even though it is
a big improvement,

05:27.523 --> 05:31.923
it is heavier than the coupe
and despite everything...

05:33.363 --> 05:35.363
..it's still not as rigid.

05:35.363 --> 05:39.723
And just knowing that,
it sort of spoils everything.

05:40.883 --> 05:43.003
So what about the Audi?

05:48.203 --> 05:51.243
The hard-top R8 V10 was one of

05:51.243 --> 05:54.243
the best cars I drove last year.

05:55.483 --> 05:59.403
And actually, in one important
respect, this is even better.

05:59.403 --> 06:00.443
That noise.

06:02.283 --> 06:06.043
With no roof, you can hear it
even more clearly.

06:13.803 --> 06:17.643
The only sound I can think of which
is better than that

06:17.643 --> 06:22.163
is the sound of Peter Mandelson
being attacked by bears.

06:24.963 --> 06:26.803
With that noise going on,

06:26.803 --> 06:31.323
it's very hard to detect
the shimmying and you really
don't notice the extra weight.

06:36.003 --> 06:39.683
Really, it's like driving
a car that has chlamydia -

06:39.683 --> 06:43.043
there are no symptoms
but you know it's there

06:43.043 --> 06:47.003
and that sort of...
spoils the relationship a bit.

06:50.163 --> 06:52.003
On the track then, both are good,

06:52.003 --> 06:55.283
but you get the sense that
neither is as good as it could be.

06:55.283 --> 07:00.683
So what about practical stuff,
such as what big speed convertibles
like these

07:00.683 --> 07:02.923
can do if you have big hair?

07:05.003 --> 07:08.643
Now, ideally to demonstrate this,
we need James May

07:08.643 --> 07:10.123
but sadly he's busy today,

07:10.123 --> 07:13.443
building a nuclear submarine
out of Lego probably.

07:13.443 --> 07:17.603
So instead we've got someone who
looks just like him...

07:17.603 --> 07:21.123
except for in every single detail.

07:22.083 --> 07:24.083
This is Lauren.

07:24.083 --> 07:26.203
She's spent all morning
having her hair done,

07:26.203 --> 07:30.043
and now we're going to see how it's
affected by driving the Audi.

07:30.043 --> 07:34.043
Was it, er, an expensive haircut?
Yeah.

07:38.443 --> 07:43.523
This is probably how you
imagine things will be if you
have a convertible supercar.

07:43.523 --> 07:47.203
The smell of the scenery,
Groove Armada in the stereo,

07:47.203 --> 07:49.963
and a James May body double
by your side.

07:51.683 --> 07:55.803
But the whole point of this car is
speed and that changes everything.

07:57.843 --> 08:01.083
SHE SCREAMS

08:02.083 --> 08:04.043
140.

08:12.523 --> 08:14.523
In just two minutes,

08:14.523 --> 08:19.483
I've turned Lauren into
a pop star from the 1980s.

08:19.483 --> 08:23.563
The Audi, then -
not a good hairstylist.

08:25.363 --> 08:30.243
Sadly, our attempts to see if
the Porsche was any better
ended prematurely.

08:31.363 --> 08:35.602
My eye! Let me...
No listen, a bee went in it.

08:35.602 --> 08:38.523
No, the thing in my nose has a face!

08:40.563 --> 08:41.602
So there we are.

08:41.602 --> 08:45.323
Set off for a weekend away with
your wife in either of these cars

08:45.323 --> 08:49.363
and you'll arrive blind and with
Bonnie Tyler in the passenger seat.

08:49.363 --> 08:53.043
Naming a winner, then,
between these two cars

08:53.043 --> 08:55.523
is not that easy because, frankly,

08:55.523 --> 08:57.243
they both lose.

08:57.243 --> 08:59.243
# Nothing I can say

08:59.243 --> 09:03.283
# A total eclipse of the heart. #

09:07.763 --> 09:11.163
Bonnie Tyler? I don't get it.

09:11.163 --> 09:14.523
So... I don't understand.

09:14.523 --> 09:17.123
So what you're saying is
they both lose.

09:17.123 --> 09:20.923
They both lose, yes, because the R8,
the hardtop and the 911 hardtop,

09:20.923 --> 09:22.803
they're like poached halibut.

09:22.803 --> 09:25.443
Halibut? Halibut.

09:25.443 --> 09:29.483
Now, if you put HP sauce
on delicious poached halibut,
you're going to ruin it.

09:29.483 --> 09:32.483
If you put HP sauce on
a bacon sandwich,

09:32.483 --> 09:34.163
you're going to make it better.

09:34.163 --> 09:37.483
You are quite odd. You know that,
don't you? It does make sense.

09:37.483 --> 09:40.643
Yeah, I think I know sort
of what you're getting at.

09:40.643 --> 09:45.203
If you take the roof off
an ordinary car like a Peugeot
or a BMW 1 Series or something,

09:45.203 --> 09:49.443
no harm done and if anything,
you make it a bit better
cos it's a bit of drama. Quite.

09:49.443 --> 09:54.163
But with serious performance cars...
Halibut. Whatever. Yeah.
..it's a different story.

09:54.203 --> 09:59.083
There are good reasons why
there's never been
a Eurofighter Typhoon Cabriolet.

09:59.083 --> 10:02.363
Precisely. And having
cleared that up,

10:02.363 --> 10:05.203
we must now find how fast these cars
go round our track

10:05.203 --> 10:08.683
and that, of course, means handing
them over to our tame racing driver.

10:08.683 --> 10:13.083
Some say that he's spent
all week daydreaming

10:13.083 --> 10:17.123
about what Rubens Barrichello
would look like in a ham slicer.

10:17.123 --> 10:19.483
LAUGHTER

10:19.483 --> 10:23.683
And that he's terrified
the BBC will reveal his salary,

10:23.683 --> 10:26.843
because he's paid
in strong pornography.

10:26.843 --> 10:28.203
LAUGHTER

10:28.203 --> 10:31.283
All we know is,
he's called the Stig.

10:32.363 --> 10:33.443
And they're off,

10:33.443 --> 10:37.563
Stig fuelled by his fanatical hatred
of Rubens Barrichello.

10:37.563 --> 10:41.243
Powering down towards
the first corner, here they are

10:41.243 --> 10:44.323
and the Audi looks like it's
getting a bit out of shape already.

10:44.323 --> 10:45.923
Yes, it is.

10:45.923 --> 10:48.443
# Night fever, night fever... #

10:48.443 --> 10:49.563
Oh dear.

10:49.563 --> 10:52.523
Stig seems to have developed
an obsession with the Bee Gees.

10:52.523 --> 10:55.843
Perhaps it's cos they share
a love of the white suit.

10:55.843 --> 10:59.003
Around Chicago,
both dipping a wheel off the track.

10:59.003 --> 11:01.323
Now hammerhead,
Stig stamping on the brakes,

11:01.323 --> 11:03.723
imagining it's the head of
a Williams driver.

11:03.723 --> 11:06.123
Not Nico Hulkenberg, obviously.

11:06.123 --> 11:09.163
911s can understeer,
but no sign of it there at all.

11:09.163 --> 11:10.723
The Audi's in good shape, too.

11:10.723 --> 11:13.683
# Sweet city woman, she moves... #

11:13.683 --> 11:17.323
I should say the Stig also dislikes
convertible supercars

11:17.323 --> 11:21.363
because he always tries to
keep his helmet out of the flies.

11:21.363 --> 11:24.043
I've just realised that
if these two go faster

11:24.043 --> 11:28.723
than their hardtop equivalents, I'm
going to look like a massive idiot.

11:28.723 --> 11:31.323
They've just got Gambon to do now.

11:31.323 --> 11:34.283
Both round and there we are,
across the line.

11:34.323 --> 11:36.483
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

11:36.483 --> 11:38.523
Come on, then. So...

11:38.523 --> 11:41.003
No pressure. Here we go. Hang on.
No pressure.

11:41.003 --> 11:44.043
The Porsche 911 Turbo convertible

11:44.043 --> 11:50.523
did it in 1:22.2 seconds,
which is there.

11:50.523 --> 11:54.003
Where's the hardtop?
We never tested the hard top.
Which is lucky for you.

11:54.003 --> 11:57.203
We have done an Audi R8, though -
it's here.

11:57.203 --> 12:01.643
If this is faster than that you are
going to look, by your own admission,
a massive idiot.

12:01.643 --> 12:02.883
Yes I am. Go on, then.

12:02.883 --> 12:05.523
1:21.6, the convertible.

12:05.523 --> 12:08.403
1:22.3!

12:08.403 --> 12:10.803
Oh-ho-ho! Look at that!

12:10.803 --> 12:13.843
You got away with that
by the skin of your teeth.

12:13.843 --> 12:16.563
Look how similar they are.

12:17.563 --> 12:19.523
Now...

12:19.523 --> 12:24.443
Before we do the news, I'd just like
to conduct a quick loyalty test.

12:24.443 --> 12:28.723
As you know, last week
there was some sort of football
match on at the same time as us,

12:28.723 --> 12:32.963
so I just wondered...
Who watched Top Gear last week?

12:32.963 --> 12:36.403
Hands up. I did. I did.
It was great. Jeremy, you?

12:36.403 --> 12:38.083
I couldn't watch it.

12:38.083 --> 12:42.803
I'll be honest, I found the bit with
the wedding pretty cringeworthy.

12:42.803 --> 12:47.603
No, I couldn't watch it
because I was in Johannesburg.
Watching the final?

12:47.603 --> 12:52.323
Oh great! So the one week when we
wanted to call in a bit of loyalty

12:52.323 --> 12:57.803
and you decided to go to South Africa
and watch a Dutchman kick a Spaniard
in the heart? Yes, I did.

12:57.803 --> 13:00.403
But I have brought
one of these back.

13:00.403 --> 13:02.043
Oh, God!

13:02.043 --> 13:05.763
Great. Two long, noisy things.

13:05.763 --> 13:07.283
One long, noisy thing.

13:07.283 --> 13:10.083
They don't work. They don't. Look.

13:10.083 --> 13:12.243
VUVUZELA FAILS TO BUZZ

13:13.363 --> 13:15.323
What was all the fuss about, then?

13:17.683 --> 13:19.363
They were terrifyingly loud.

13:19.363 --> 13:23.963
I might have drunk some tequila
through it, I admit, after the match
but it doesn't work.

13:23.963 --> 13:27.323
You try. You won't...
You've got a degree.

13:27.323 --> 13:30.003
If you play a solo, I'll kick you.

13:30.003 --> 13:31.803
NO NOISE

13:31.803 --> 13:33.683
LAUGHTER

13:38.123 --> 13:41.643
That wouldn't disturb a game of
chess, let alone a football match.

13:43.883 --> 13:48.603
It doesn't work.
Why is it orange, anyway?
I was supporting the Dutch.

13:48.603 --> 13:53.443
Why were you supporting the Dutch?
Because the Dutch watch Top Gear
and the Spanish don't.

13:53.443 --> 13:57.643
And you don't watch Top Gear in
your house either, apparently.
Can we do the news?

13:57.643 --> 14:02.403
A university in Virginia,
which is in America,

14:02.403 --> 14:05.723
has come up with a car
which can be driven by...

14:05.723 --> 14:10.243
Er...dead people? No. That's stupid.
Bats. That's really stupid.

14:10.243 --> 14:13.683
No. He's nearly right with bats -
it can be driven by blind people.

14:13.683 --> 14:15.883
Really? I've a photograph of it here.

14:15.883 --> 14:18.883
The inventors say it's always been
wrongly assumed

14:18.883 --> 14:22.243
that blind people can't drive.

14:22.243 --> 14:23.283
Well, they can't.

14:23.283 --> 14:27.083
Realistically... Blind people can
drive, just mostly into things.

14:27.083 --> 14:28.963
This is where this comes in.

14:28.963 --> 14:33.363
It's got lasers and radar on it and
they feed news of impending disaster

14:33.363 --> 14:37.603
to the driver via compressed air
and a vibrating vest.

14:37.603 --> 14:41.403
Vest? Right. What happens if you
put your vest on backwards

14:41.403 --> 14:45.163
cos you can't see the label cos,
no offence, but you're blind.

14:45.163 --> 14:48.843
So, and then it will say left when
it means right and you'll crash.

14:48.843 --> 14:53.243
I think it's important people do
whatever they can to help disabled
people. That's important.

14:53.243 --> 14:56.803
But I just can't see that working.
I-I don't....

14:56.803 --> 14:59.763
I'm not sure.
It's far too complicated.

14:59.763 --> 15:02.803
Why don't they just take up my idea
and teach dogs to drive?

15:02.803 --> 15:06.043
James, dogs can't drive.

15:06.043 --> 15:10.843
Thank you, James. Animal Hospital
next week, presented by the idiot.

15:10.843 --> 15:15.083
This system on this buggy
was developed by students.

15:15.083 --> 15:20.843
Volvo, a byword for safety,
has now developed a similar system
and they recently invited

15:20.843 --> 15:25.363
all the world's press over to Sweden
to look at a system which basically
sees the obstacle.

15:25.363 --> 15:29.283
If it thinks the driver's not
concentrating, has fallen asleep...
Or is blind.

15:29.283 --> 15:34.323
Or s blind, it will brake for you.
Here's their test.
This was just a couple of weeks ago.

15:44.923 --> 15:48.443
There was a report out
the other week about dangerous roads
in Britain.

15:48.443 --> 15:51.243
There were some
incredible statistics in it.

15:51.243 --> 15:56.123
Half of all the crashes in Britain
happen on 10% of the roads.

15:56.123 --> 15:59.203
One of the most dangerous roads
is this one.

15:59.203 --> 16:01.883
The A537 near Macclesfield.

16:01.883 --> 16:05.763
Most of the roads
in the most dangerous category
are bikers' roads.

16:05.763 --> 16:09.883
Oh, here we go.
Have a go at bikers time, is it?
It's been a while. Go on, kick us.

16:09.883 --> 16:11.403
Let me give you this.

16:11.403 --> 16:15.923
One in four fatal or serious
accidents on an A road
involves a bike.

16:15.923 --> 16:19.123
There are only eight bikes
on the road of Britain

16:19.123 --> 16:23.283
and they're involved in
a quarter of all crashes. Well...

16:23.283 --> 16:27.363
If in terms of miles covered,
they're more dangerous than puff
adders.

16:27.363 --> 16:31.723
If you've got one of those
Suzuki black busas...
Hayabusa, actually.

16:31.723 --> 16:35.083
Black busa sounds like a sex toy.
It probably is, yes.

16:35.083 --> 16:39.483
Hayabusa. So you drive that,
on average, about ten times a year.

16:39.483 --> 16:43.843
Statistically you will be killed
three times every time you go out.

16:43.843 --> 16:45.563
Let me give you another statistic.

16:45.563 --> 16:50.163
The average age at which
a biker is killed is 35. A-ha.

16:50.163 --> 16:52.803
What? I'm 47.

16:52.803 --> 16:56.603
That means you've been living
on borrowed time for 12 years.

16:56.603 --> 17:01.123
No, for 12 years he's been riding
his bike perfectly perpendicular
to the road.

17:01.123 --> 17:02.283
He does, actually.

17:02.283 --> 17:05.163
Honestly. He left here
the other day,

17:05.163 --> 17:09.123
I've seen faster-moving
icebergs than you.

17:09.123 --> 17:14.083
He got behind a bus going up to
the A3 from here and he sat behind
the bus the entire way.

17:14.083 --> 17:16.723
"I'm going along." You did.

17:16.723 --> 17:21.123
That's because
the bus said Guildford on the front
and that's where I wanted to go.

17:21.123 --> 17:23.443
LAUGHTER

17:25.643 --> 17:27.443
What's the point?

17:28.723 --> 17:33.203
Can I just say, on the roads round
where I... Anyone else live
in the Cotswolds round here?

17:33.203 --> 17:36.843
You do? Have you seen those roads
where it says "bikers beware"?

17:36.843 --> 17:40.643
What does that mean? Does that mean
I'm supposed to beware of them?

17:40.643 --> 17:44.643
The point about the sign is,
it's sign shorthand,
so you can read it at speed.

17:44.643 --> 17:49.083
There's no point making a sign
saying "Motorcyclists,
have you considered that there

17:49.083 --> 17:53.683
"may be a cantankerous, pig-headed
middle-aged man with pubes for hair
driving around

17:53.683 --> 17:59.243
"on an overpowered Mercedes that
should be a four-seater but hasn't a
back seat, yet costs twice as much."

17:59.243 --> 18:01.763
The sign would be enormous.

18:01.763 --> 18:04.403
Why doesn't it just say
"bikers, go home"?

18:04.403 --> 18:06.883
Anyone here a biker?
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

18:06.883 --> 18:11.203
Right, so eight. 42 set off.

18:11.203 --> 18:13.203
You want to talk dangerous?

18:13.203 --> 18:15.363
Cigarette, Jeremy? Why not.

18:15.363 --> 18:16.563
I'll do you a bet.

18:16.563 --> 18:19.363
After the show tonight -
you can all come and watch -

18:19.363 --> 18:22.363
you get on to your black busa...
Hayabusa.

18:22.363 --> 18:27.643
You ride round the track as fast
as you can and I'll chain-smoke,
we'll see who dies first. 100 quid.

18:27.643 --> 18:29.443
You're on.

18:33.083 --> 18:35.083
A ridiculous bet.

18:37.923 --> 18:40.643
Anyway, that is the end of
the news. We must move on.

18:40.643 --> 18:43.123
As we know, caravans are a menace.

18:43.123 --> 18:45.843
We all know that. The reason
for this is very simple.

18:45.843 --> 18:49.843
Nobody who tows a caravan
has had any training, which means
they're a bit frightened,

18:49.843 --> 18:55.803
which means they drive slowly
and that means they clog up the
British countryside all summer long.

18:55.803 --> 18:59.483
Motorhomes would appear
to be a better option but here

18:59.483 --> 19:03.243
we have a problem because
there are only really two types.

19:03.243 --> 19:05.963
There is the American RV,

19:05.963 --> 19:10.283
which is extremely cool but far too
large, really, for European roads.

19:10.283 --> 19:14.603
Then there is the British
alternative, which is much smaller -

19:14.603 --> 19:18.643
it's much easier to drive
on our roads - but it really is
rather tragic.

19:18.643 --> 19:22.403
Yeah, so with that in mind,
our producers came up with a plan.

19:22.403 --> 19:25.683
They said we each had to build
our own motorhome which would be

19:25.683 --> 19:29.923
small enough to work in Europe but
still cool. The rules were simple.

19:29.923 --> 19:34.923
Whatever we made
had to have sleeping accommodation,
cooking facilities and a bog.

19:34.923 --> 19:40.003
Then they said once we'd
finished them, we had to meet up
for a series of challenges.

19:43.203 --> 19:46.843
Our meeting point
was Fleet services on the M3.

19:48.803 --> 19:51.443
And Richard was the first to arrive.

19:54.163 --> 19:55.843
And there it is.

19:55.843 --> 19:59.403
I am genuinely,
genuinely proud of this.

19:59.403 --> 20:01.643
'But before I had a chance

20:01.643 --> 20:05.243
'to talk you through my Land Rover,
Jeremy arrived...'

20:05.243 --> 20:06.763
What?

20:07.843 --> 20:11.523
'..in what appeared to be a block of
flats on top of an old Citroen.'

20:17.163 --> 20:18.803
Look at it!

20:18.803 --> 20:19.843
Come on.

20:21.563 --> 20:25.363
It's enormous.
It's absolutely superb.

20:25.363 --> 20:27.363
Do you ever watch Grand Designs?
Yes.

20:27.363 --> 20:31.363
You do? Kevin McCloud programme?
Every single thing they build
looks like this.

20:31.363 --> 20:34.483
The indented windows -
it's modern, it's crisp.

20:34.483 --> 20:36.323
No, he'd love it.

20:36.323 --> 20:39.443
He'd love to ask which cock
stuck that on top of a Citroen.

20:42.243 --> 20:46.803
'To try and bring Richard round,
I showed him my interior.'

20:48.283 --> 20:49.403
Wow!

20:49.403 --> 20:51.083
It's three-storey.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.803
Japanese contemplation area here.

20:53.803 --> 20:55.923
Very useful.

20:55.923 --> 21:01.163
Upstairs, two hammocks and full
cooking facilities, with a grill.

21:02.163 --> 21:06.643
'With the tour over,
Kevin McClarkson turned his
attention to my Land Rover.'

21:06.643 --> 21:08.243
This is hideous.

21:08.243 --> 21:13.683
It's stone effect, which is
right with the Land Rover thing.

21:13.683 --> 21:15.163
It's hideous.

21:15.163 --> 21:19.283
JEREMY CHORTLES
It's perfect, you see.

21:19.283 --> 21:21.643
Please tell me this is not real.
Yes, it is.

21:21.643 --> 21:24.763
It is, entirely. If you need it,
it's there for you.

21:24.763 --> 21:28.523
You're joking.
If you need it, it's there.

21:28.523 --> 21:32.083
'All we had to do then
was wait for James.'

21:32.083 --> 21:33.763
I have to say,

21:33.763 --> 21:36.883
Land Rover famed
for its reliability.

21:36.883 --> 21:41.763
No, wait - not reliability. No.
And Citroen famed for...
The same problem.

21:41.763 --> 21:44.723
The same problem.
If James turns up in an Alfa,

21:44.723 --> 21:47.923
we really have completed the set.
We'll have the lot.

21:47.923 --> 21:51.003
'But James didn't turn up in an Alfa

21:51.003 --> 21:54.403
'because he'd thought of something
even more unreliable.'

21:54.403 --> 21:56.203
Whoa!

21:56.203 --> 21:58.523
It's an old Lotus with a roof box.

21:58.523 --> 22:01.203
I didn't expect that.

22:01.203 --> 22:02.963
Wow!

22:02.963 --> 22:05.163
You haven't got the idea of it
at all.

22:05.163 --> 22:06.323
No, no, no. This...

22:06.323 --> 22:10.243
I don't like to be immodest, but
this is actually a very good idea.

22:10.243 --> 22:13.683
It's inspired by the work
of the pioneer aviators.

22:13.683 --> 22:16.483
It's extremely light,
it's brilliant. Hammond?

22:18.443 --> 22:21.123
It's a roof box
with a sleeping bag in it. Yeah.

22:21.123 --> 22:23.283
Where's your bog? There.

22:23.283 --> 22:25.363
Oh! Where your head is.

22:25.363 --> 22:28.923
And how do you go on that?
The roof goes up. How does it go up?

22:28.923 --> 22:30.803
It's on telescopic...things.

22:30.803 --> 22:35.003
It's not a motorhome. It is. It's a
motor car with accommodation on it.

22:35.003 --> 22:36.763
What's this? Why's it got that?

22:36.763 --> 22:39.043
Stability. Rubbish.

22:39.043 --> 22:41.283
Storage.

22:41.283 --> 22:42.563
That's it? That's...

22:42.563 --> 22:46.043
What do you need? A tin opener
and a vegetable peeler.

22:46.043 --> 22:49.603
I like that. There's another one
on the other side with toiletries.

22:50.763 --> 22:53.763
'James was then keen
to inspect Hammond's.'

22:53.763 --> 22:57.883
This is a Land Rover with...
..the curtains on the outside.

22:57.883 --> 23:00.323
I don't understand this. Look.

23:00.323 --> 23:03.963
There will be opportunity, I'm sure,
for me to demonstrate how this works.

23:03.963 --> 23:09.363
I've taken inspiration from the
American motorhomes that slide out
at the sides. Have you? Yeah.

23:09.363 --> 23:13.163
So this gets bigger.
How does it get bigger?
A lot bigger, you'll see.

23:13.163 --> 23:18.283
'At this point, we were interrupted
by the arrival of a challenge.'

23:18.283 --> 23:22.003
Hello. Here we go. This is it.

23:22.003 --> 23:25.563
It says, "You are going on a camping
holiday." Yes, that's a win.

23:25.563 --> 23:27.963
Where? He loves camping. Oh, yes.

23:27.963 --> 23:29.723
In Cornwall. Yes!

23:29.723 --> 23:33.203
That's going to be great. It's not.
What's great about Cornwall?

23:33.203 --> 23:36.683
Cornwall's lovely.
You'll have sand in your food.

23:36.683 --> 23:39.363
You'll be freezing cold if
you go anywhere near the sea.

23:39.363 --> 23:42.963
The food will be stuff you
recognise, you'll be able
to read the road signs.

23:42.963 --> 23:45.123
Why don't we go to France?

23:45.123 --> 23:47.643
Stop being a wimp.

23:47.643 --> 23:51.283
"You ARE going on a camping holiday
in Cornwall.

23:51.283 --> 23:54.843
"This is 215 miles
from where you are now."

23:54.843 --> 23:57.363
It's going to be great fun.
It's a win, win, win.

23:57.363 --> 24:00.603
I'm going camping - my favourite
activity - in my favourite weather.

24:02.523 --> 24:03.683
It's my best day ever.

24:04.723 --> 24:08.243
'So, with my heart singing,
it was time to show the world

24:08.243 --> 24:11.643
'that a new era in motorhoming
had begun.'

24:11.643 --> 24:12.843
We roll.

24:12.843 --> 24:14.963
There we go.

24:26.923 --> 24:30.003
So just to recap, viewers,
what I'm doing now

24:30.003 --> 24:32.803
is going for a nice drive
down to Cornwall in my Lotus.

24:32.803 --> 24:37.483
There is no impression whatsoever
of there being anything on the roof.

24:37.483 --> 24:41.403
That weighs less than me
and that's the point.

24:41.403 --> 24:45.843
Lightness. Preserving motoring
pleasure for the "campervanist".

24:46.603 --> 24:49.403
'Sadly, when the Land Rover
got up to speed,

24:49.403 --> 24:52.963
'I realised there was
a bit of a design flaw.'

24:52.963 --> 24:55.283
I modified this particular example

24:55.283 --> 24:58.763
and cut away the bodywork
to create this.

24:58.763 --> 25:03.043
I have left a slight gap
sort of all round here

25:03.043 --> 25:04.843
and there is quite a draught.

25:04.843 --> 25:07.003
It is quite chilly.

25:07.003 --> 25:10.843
'Mind you, compared to
Jeremy's design flaw...'

25:10.843 --> 25:13.403
Argh. Ah!

25:13.403 --> 25:14.843
Aargh! Oh!

25:14.843 --> 25:18.323
Oh, my God! No! This is terrifying.

25:18.323 --> 25:22.723
It's a... I cant begin to
describe what this feels like.

25:22.723 --> 25:25.763
It's... OK! ..wobbling quite badly.

25:25.763 --> 25:28.363
'I asked James to pull in behind

25:28.363 --> 25:30.883
'and assess the gravity
of the situation.

25:30.883 --> 25:32.923
'But he wasn't much help.'

25:32.923 --> 25:35.483
HE CHUCKLES

25:37.923 --> 25:40.363
'And to be honest, nor was Hammond.'

25:40.363 --> 25:41.723
HE CHUCKLES

25:46.603 --> 25:49.163
I've cocked up.
I know I've cocked up.

25:49.163 --> 25:50.843
Low bridge!

25:52.323 --> 25:56.043
Jeremy, did you make a note
of how tall it actually is?

25:56.043 --> 25:58.243
No, I didn't.

25:58.243 --> 26:01.603
Yes. He hasn't got a clue.

26:01.603 --> 26:03.603
Aaargh!

26:03.603 --> 26:08.403
'As Jeremy screamed
his way onto the A303...

26:08.403 --> 26:11.323
'all was well in the Lotus.'

26:11.323 --> 26:15.403
I know people have a bit of a downer
on Lotus and believe they're
hideously unreliable

26:15.403 --> 26:18.963
but really, there's absolutely
nothing wrong with this car

26:18.963 --> 26:23.483
apart from a little bit of
electrical infidelity and the clock.

26:23.483 --> 26:25.963
I mean, it works but only
the minute hand works.

26:25.963 --> 26:30.123
I know it's quarter to, I just
don't know what it's quarter to to.

26:30.123 --> 26:34.523
OK. I'm going to operate
the heater controls.

26:34.523 --> 26:39.203
Land Rover heaters are not their best
feature, if I'm honest.

26:39.203 --> 26:41.083
That's on full.

26:42.083 --> 26:43.923
I can't feel it at all.

26:43.923 --> 26:48.723
'In the leaning tower of Citroen,
I was starting to relax a bit.'

26:50.243 --> 26:51.963
She was VERY pretty.

26:53.803 --> 26:58.003
She just liked it. She wouldn't
like to go in Hammond's,
cos that's stupid.

26:58.003 --> 26:59.283
HE SHRIEKS

27:00.403 --> 27:03.123
Aaaaargh!

27:05.883 --> 27:10.123
Jeremy, can I just say, this is
the biggest entertainment I've had

27:10.123 --> 27:13.883
on a road journey in my whole life.
It's absolutely hilarious.

27:15.203 --> 27:16.843
'It wasn't hilarious, though.

27:16.843 --> 27:21.403
'And since Hammond's Cottage was
now suffering from subsidence,

27:21.403 --> 27:23.603
'we pulled in for some bodging.'

27:23.603 --> 27:24.883
Hammond...

27:24.883 --> 27:27.283
Yeah? We've done 20 miles. I know.

27:27.283 --> 27:31.043
We'll have to stop nine times
to rebuild your shed
before we get anywhere.

27:32.883 --> 27:36.723
'In a matter of moments, I'd
mended the Citroen's attachment.'

27:36.723 --> 27:40.563
The problem was, the air was hitting
this massive slab here,

27:40.563 --> 27:44.763
forcing the whole car back
and lifting the front wheels
off the ground,

27:44.763 --> 27:46.643
so I've taken out this window.

27:46.643 --> 27:49.323
The air will now go in there

27:49.323 --> 27:53.563
and then I've removed the rear door,
so it can come out here.

27:55.123 --> 27:56.643
20,

27:56.643 --> 27:58.643
30.

27:58.643 --> 28:02.443
Oh, yeah.
That's just massively improved it.

28:03.923 --> 28:05.363
Aargh!

28:05.363 --> 28:06.963
Whoo!

28:06.963 --> 28:09.443
No, it's made no difference.

28:09.443 --> 28:11.363
Make it stop!

28:12.643 --> 28:15.483
Right, we've done about 30 miles.

28:15.483 --> 28:17.763
180-something to go.

28:21.163 --> 28:24.003
'Amazingly, the convoy did keep going

28:24.003 --> 28:27.123
'until eventually,
we pulled in for a fuel stop.'

28:27.123 --> 28:30.243
OK. Now this is a bit of a faff.

28:31.403 --> 28:33.963
HE GRUNTS

28:38.203 --> 28:40.203
Hammond? Yes?

28:40.203 --> 28:43.763
I may have made a mistake. Where?

28:43.763 --> 28:46.043
Well, I added this escape chute

28:46.043 --> 28:50.083
so that I can go from
my aeroplane fuselage into
the back seat of the car,

28:50.083 --> 28:52.443
which is here. It's very good...

28:52.443 --> 28:54.763
But I've covered up the filler flap.

28:57.163 --> 29:00.403
Oh, my God! Jeremy, no, no, no! No.

29:00.403 --> 29:04.363
What? Seriously, you're going to
hit it. Yeah, that's quite close.

29:04.363 --> 29:07.243
Yeah, but, unlike your two cars...

29:07.243 --> 29:09.163
Ready?

29:12.923 --> 29:15.883
Ha-ha! Oh, yes.

29:15.883 --> 29:17.963
Yes!

29:17.963 --> 29:20.723
'Soon, refuelling was under way.'

29:24.003 --> 29:25.643
Here we go.

29:29.083 --> 29:32.723
JEREMY CHUCKLES
Go away.

29:32.723 --> 29:37.323
That's an all-new...
I've never seen a lockable fuel
filler cap where you need to saw it.

29:37.323 --> 29:38.843
It's very secure.

29:41.483 --> 29:44.283
'Refuelling over,
we headed on our way.

29:44.283 --> 29:47.563
'And several
perilous miles later...'

29:47.563 --> 29:50.843
Aaargh!

29:50.843 --> 29:53.083
'..we finally reached Cornwall.'

29:55.123 --> 29:56.723
That's where we're going.

29:56.723 --> 30:00.883
Ooh! I've got all the excitement
you get as a kid on a family holiday,

30:00.883 --> 30:03.043
winding round little roads.

30:03.043 --> 30:06.203
The odd glimpse of the sea.

30:06.203 --> 30:09.083
Been on the go now
pretty much seven hours.

30:09.083 --> 30:14.243
Could have flown to New York
in that time. But no.

30:14.243 --> 30:17.723
Here, drizzle, cold, frightened,

30:17.723 --> 30:21.483
and all I have to look forward to is
camping with a...

30:22.563 --> 30:24.523
A lunatic and a retard.

30:27.283 --> 30:28.883
'But then...'

30:28.883 --> 30:30.803
Oh, no!

30:30.803 --> 30:31.883
Got a warning light.

30:34.483 --> 30:37.843
Guys, I've got a warning light
on the dashboard. Says, "Stop."

30:39.323 --> 30:43.763
'As you'd expect, the happy campers
chose to ignore my distress signal.'

30:43.763 --> 30:48.003
Oh, yeah. That looks
a suitable holiday destination.

30:48.003 --> 30:50.403
I think so.

30:51.923 --> 30:55.003
Holy moly!

30:55.003 --> 30:59.723
What manner of terrible thing
has happened under my bonnet?

30:59.723 --> 31:03.883
It's actually had diarrhoea,
is what's happened here.

31:03.883 --> 31:05.843
'At the campsite,

31:05.843 --> 31:09.563
'I settled down to watch Hammond's
creation take shape.'

31:14.443 --> 31:16.443
Yep. Oh, yep.

31:16.443 --> 31:18.923
RICHARD GRUNTS

31:21.043 --> 31:22.083
Ow!

31:25.763 --> 31:27.563
I'm brave.

31:27.563 --> 31:29.323
Do you want some help?

31:29.323 --> 31:32.563
No. Don't need it, mate.
A one-man job, this.

31:35.843 --> 31:39.643
'Having got the block of flats going
again, Jeremy eventually joined us.'

31:39.643 --> 31:42.123
This is gripping.

31:44.163 --> 31:47.043
What are you doing?
Finishing touches.

31:47.043 --> 31:52.403
'In Hammond's head,
his build was coming along nicely.

31:52.403 --> 31:53.923
'But it wasn't.

31:56.403 --> 31:59.243
And an hour later,
Jeremy and I were bored.'

31:59.243 --> 32:00.603
Is there a pub?

32:00.603 --> 32:02.403
'There was, so we went to it,

32:02.403 --> 32:05.203
'leaving Hammond
to carry on building.'

32:06.923 --> 32:09.083
I see this as a sort of club room.

32:09.083 --> 32:12.843
Darts...hanging out with your mates.

32:14.083 --> 32:16.363
Oh, yes.

32:16.363 --> 32:17.403
There it is.

32:17.403 --> 32:20.403
Shall we order Hammond something?

32:20.403 --> 32:24.163
I'm thinking of the beer-battered
fish, pea puree, tartare sauce.

32:24.163 --> 32:27.883
"I don't like beer, I don't like
batter, I don't like fish..."

32:27.883 --> 32:30.803
He doesn't eat fish.
I know, he doesn't eat fish.

32:30.803 --> 32:33.363
He might eat a free-range egg.

32:35.563 --> 32:38.443
'Back at base,
the wind was getting up.'

32:45.643 --> 32:47.603
That bit's slightly too short.

32:52.843 --> 32:56.803
'When we got back from the pub,
Hammond was still going.'

32:56.803 --> 32:58.083
Is this his motorhome?

32:58.083 --> 33:01.603
I don't believe it.
That is outrageous.

33:01.603 --> 33:03.163
Come in, dude, come in.

33:03.163 --> 33:05.283
This is the bed.

33:05.283 --> 33:07.683
Yeah, that can happen. Sorry, sorry.

33:07.683 --> 33:11.363
I'll give you a quick squiz round if
you like. This is the library here.

33:11.363 --> 33:14.363
Thank you. So you've got a library.

33:14.363 --> 33:16.403
This is the dining room. It goes on.

33:16.403 --> 33:17.963
Look at that!

33:17.963 --> 33:21.803
Bloody Nora.
In here, this.. BLEEP Mind that.

33:21.803 --> 33:23.843
What's in here?

33:26.003 --> 33:27.683
That's a child's bedroom.

33:27.683 --> 33:30.003
What's this? This is lovely.

33:30.003 --> 33:33.083
He's got an ancestral portrait.

33:33.083 --> 33:35.803
Yes, Great Uncle...
Great Uncle Tall there.

33:35.803 --> 33:39.723
Just a minute - this is
Great Uncle Yourself.

33:42.843 --> 33:46.203
'With the very lengthy tour over,
it was time to get some sleep.'

33:46.203 --> 33:48.963
WIND HOWLS

33:51.363 --> 33:54.803
These are my night clothes
that I like to wear.

33:57.643 --> 33:59.163
There we go.

34:02.683 --> 34:05.043
Oh!
THUD

34:06.243 --> 34:08.322
'Still, could be worse.'

34:08.322 --> 34:10.963
CLATTERING AND HOWLING OF WIND

34:14.123 --> 34:15.402
Oh, God!

34:23.402 --> 34:25.283
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

34:26.003 --> 34:27.523
Thank you so much.

34:27.523 --> 34:29.362
Thank you. Now...

34:30.523 --> 34:32.882
We'll pick that up later on,

34:32.882 --> 34:37.163
but now it's time to put a star
in our reasonably priced car.

34:37.163 --> 34:40.922
My guest tonight is actually
a caravan enthusiast.

34:40.922 --> 34:43.842
But unlike any other
caravan enthusiast,

34:43.842 --> 34:46.123
he also starred in The Godfather.

34:46.123 --> 34:48.882
And Ocean's Eleven,
Twelve and Thirteen

34:48.882 --> 34:50.882
and once, he had his head cut off.

34:50.882 --> 34:53.203
Ladies and gentlemen, Andy Garcia.

34:53.203 --> 34:55.963
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

34:55.963 --> 34:58.563
How are you?

35:01.443 --> 35:03.763
Major Hollywood.

35:04.941 --> 35:08.621
Thank you very much. I love England.
Well, that's... You see,

35:08.621 --> 35:10.981
you've won their hearts already.

35:10.981 --> 35:15.541
I'm always fascinated, when we do
occasionally have big Hollywood
stars come on the show...

35:15.541 --> 35:18.581
Please, please. What it feels like,
cos I presume

35:18.581 --> 35:23.621
when you go on American chat shows
it's all red carpets and men
with mascara and shiny teeth.

35:23.621 --> 35:26.301
Like you. No.

35:26.301 --> 35:29.341
And you come down here and it's
a kind of a windswept airfield

35:29.341 --> 35:32.141
and there's a man with a white
helmet on who won't speak to you.

35:32.141 --> 35:35.981
Then we put you into a car with
a steering wheel on what you
perceive to be the wrong side

35:35.981 --> 35:38.741
and make you drive round a track.
Was it fun? You enjoy that?

35:38.741 --> 35:42.821
I enjoyed it very much.
I drive stick but obviously,
with a different hand.

35:42.821 --> 35:47.421
I do a lot of things with both
hands, so I'm pretty used to it.

35:47.421 --> 35:48.941
LAUGHTER

35:50.941 --> 35:52.741
She's gone bright red, look.

35:52.741 --> 35:54.821
So has he.

35:56.341 --> 35:59.461
We've actually got a clip which I
really want to start off with,

35:59.461 --> 36:03.981
of one of your first attempts
in practice laps, which nearly
resulted in the death of the Stig.

36:03.981 --> 36:07.181
Would anybody here like to see that?

36:07.181 --> 36:10.541
AUDIENCE: Yes! Let's just have a
look at this before we get cracking.

36:10.541 --> 36:13.901
Here we come, up to Gambon Corner.

36:13.901 --> 36:16.701
A little wide...
Really very wide indeed.

36:16.701 --> 36:18.901
And there is...

36:18.901 --> 36:22.741
I never liked him from the start.
You didn't like him.

36:22.741 --> 36:25.421
He is actually deeply...

36:25.421 --> 36:29.181
It's very rude if someone talks to
you and never shows you his face.

36:29.181 --> 36:31.981
Now, obviously...

36:31.981 --> 36:35.421
the first thing I notice
is you arrived with...a face hair.

36:35.421 --> 36:38.181
That's what I'm going to say.

36:38.181 --> 36:40.341
It actually peels off.

36:40.341 --> 36:42.541
Does it really? No, it doesn't.

36:42.541 --> 36:46.061
Is this for a movie, I presume?
Why else would you wear
a thing like this?

36:47.661 --> 36:52.021
We're sorting out the issue
of motorhomes tonight,
what you'd call RVs.

36:52.021 --> 36:54.901
Right. I understand you are
a caravan enthusiast.

36:54.901 --> 36:56.421
Er...

36:56.421 --> 36:58.101
I have an airstream trailer.

36:58.101 --> 37:01.941
This is the chrome... The chrome,
silver bullet-looking thing.

37:01.941 --> 37:05.501
In this case it's a large one -
it's 34 feet, which is fantastic.

37:05.501 --> 37:10.261
The thing about an airstream is
it looks very good, but you
still have to crap in a bucket.

37:10.261 --> 37:14.461
Yeah, like that piece of BLEEP
you provided for me over here.

37:14.461 --> 37:18.061
There's hot water in there somewhere.
No, there isn't.

37:20.221 --> 37:23.501
You are actually - joking aside -
you are a family man.

37:23.501 --> 37:26.221
You run a very close family,
I would say.

37:26.221 --> 37:30.101
I've got four kids -
three girls first and a little boy.
Started all over again.

37:30.101 --> 37:34.781
And your daughter Dominik... Yes.
She's in your new film, I gather.

37:34.781 --> 37:37.661
She's in City Island,
which opens on Friday the 23rd.

37:37.661 --> 37:42.261
You're allowed to do that.
And what's it about? It's a farce?

37:42.261 --> 37:47.461
It's a human comedy
about this dysfunctional
Italian-American family,

37:47.461 --> 37:52.661
all the secrets they harbour from
each other. It's a wonderful story
and we're very proud of the film.

37:52.661 --> 37:55.821
We've got a clip of it,
which I'd like to show.
Let's have a look.

37:55.821 --> 37:59.461
I was thinking that, being a Saturday
night and all and Vivien's here,

37:59.461 --> 38:03.381
why don't we have a big
home-cooked dinner tonight?

38:03.381 --> 38:04.461
Big - nice and big.

38:04.461 --> 38:05.581
Yeah, sure.

38:05.581 --> 38:07.861
Like I do every Saturday night.

38:07.861 --> 38:09.701
Yeah, but like something special.

38:09.701 --> 38:12.941
Like for a real special occasion,
something special.

38:12.941 --> 38:14.581
Something nice.

38:14.581 --> 38:16.861
You want balloons or something?

38:16.861 --> 38:20.701
No, I don't want balloons. I'm just
saying - something nice.
When don't I make it nice?

38:20.701 --> 38:23.141
Make something nicer.
Make it yourself!

38:24.941 --> 38:26.781
OK, Vivien. I've got to ask you.

38:26.781 --> 38:28.621
Are your breasts continuing to grow?

38:28.621 --> 38:31.141
What? Vince. What?

38:31.141 --> 38:32.861
Does have a point there, sweetie.

38:32.861 --> 38:35.981
You do seem to be getting a little
large in that area. Oh, nice, Dad.

38:35.981 --> 38:37.621
APPLAUSE

38:37.621 --> 38:39.941
That's your daughter.

38:39.941 --> 38:41.781
This is a girl who, in real life,

38:41.781 --> 38:45.061
you never let her have keys
to your house. Is that right?

38:45.061 --> 38:46.941
She reminded me of that recently.

38:46.941 --> 38:50.181
I never gave her keys to the house
because I always wanted her to...

38:50.181 --> 38:53.981
You know, when she knocked, I'd come
downstairs and open the door and...

38:53.981 --> 38:57.701
That's a good idea. I'm going to
confiscate my daughter's keys
immediately.

38:57.701 --> 39:01.301
Except she always comes in at three,
which is really awkward.

39:01.301 --> 39:05.021
Obviously, you have been in very
many big films over the years.

39:05.021 --> 39:07.781
We've mentioned some -
The Untouchables, Black Rain.

39:07.781 --> 39:11.221
I think not a lot of people realise
this. Because of The Godfather,

39:11.221 --> 39:14.101
they assume you must be Italian,
but you were born in Cuba.

39:14.101 --> 39:18.301
I was born in Cuba and I left
2Â½ years after the revolution.
I was 5Â½ years old.

39:18.301 --> 39:22.061
How did you get out? How did it
work? We were some of the last...

39:22.061 --> 39:25.861
They call freedom flights before they
shut the country completely down,

39:25.861 --> 39:31.181
and you had to leave
at that point in an inner tube,
or, interestingly enough,

39:31.181 --> 39:36.021
there have been cases where they've
turned old cars into actual floating
amphibious...

39:36.021 --> 39:40.341
And they've taken off.
I don't know where they got the idea
for that from. I can't imagine.

39:40.341 --> 39:43.461
I know you guys explored that,
but it's true.

39:43.461 --> 39:47.981
They've found big Buicks or flatbed
trucks floating across
the Florida Straits with a...

39:47.981 --> 39:51.901
The ingenuity, though, in Cuba,
to keep those big old American cars
going, is just...

39:51.901 --> 39:56.581
They make brake fluid out of
shampoo and alcohol.

39:56.581 --> 40:00.741
Yeah, and brake pads out of asbestos.
I saw a documentary -
a car documentary -

40:00.741 --> 40:03.781
and there was a gentleman
mixing asbestos with his hands

40:03.781 --> 40:06.781
and mixing it to create
the pad for the brakes,

40:06.781 --> 40:09.101
and they said,
"You know this can kill you?"

40:09.101 --> 40:10.821
And he said, "Yes, I know.

40:10.821 --> 40:14.381
"But how do I provide for my family
if I don't do this?"

40:14.381 --> 40:18.981
What a life. Imagine what life would
have been like if your parents
hadn't got you out.

40:18.981 --> 40:20.541
I was very lucky.

40:20.541 --> 40:24.581
Are you familiar with the story
of the Cuban Grand Prix in '59?

40:24.581 --> 40:27.861
Yes, it was a kidnapping
of Juan Manuel Fangio,

40:27.861 --> 40:32.981
the famous Argentinian race car
driver, and he was kidnapped
by the Cuban revolutionaries.

40:32.981 --> 40:35.301
They released him after
the Grand Prix,

40:35.301 --> 40:40.261
and they said, "Why'd they kidnap
you?" He said, "For publicity."

40:40.261 --> 40:45.461
"Did they treat you badly?" He goes,
"No, they were perfect gentlemen."
It was one of those amazing stories.

40:45.461 --> 40:50.221
Juan used to put... Before a race,
you've got to turn
and analyse the turn,

40:50.221 --> 40:52.021
he'd put like a big silver dollar,

40:52.021 --> 40:55.301
a Cuban big peso or something
and then bet people

40:55.301 --> 40:58.261
that in that turn
he was going to run it over.

40:58.261 --> 41:00.581
He was a great proponent
of the four-wheel drift.

41:00.581 --> 41:03.301
So to hit a silver dollar
while doing a four-wheel drift...

41:03.301 --> 41:06.541
So do you drive some big old
American Chevy then,

41:06.541 --> 41:10.021
that you keep going with
shampoo and things in the States?

41:10.021 --> 41:15.821
No, I have a little Porsche that
I drive, a 4S, 2006 or something.

41:15.821 --> 41:19.301
So no Prius? No Prius. Good man.

41:19.301 --> 41:21.061
You're very welcome here.

41:21.061 --> 41:23.221
APPLAUSE

41:27.701 --> 41:31.341
I'm all for clean diesel and hybrids
and all that, but not a Prius.

41:31.341 --> 41:33.021
Just not a Prius.

41:33.021 --> 41:37.541
Did you not once have a Peugeot? It
was a diesel wagon, 504 diesel wagon.

41:37.541 --> 41:41.341
It was a beautiful car. Couldn't make
its way over the hill in Hollywood,

41:41.341 --> 41:44.861
but it rode beautifully
on the highway in fifth gear.

41:44.861 --> 41:48.581
It would quiet down, and you'd put
like 20 dollars of diesel in it

41:48.581 --> 41:50.461
and it'd last for like 14 months.

41:50.461 --> 41:54.021
It had beautiful lines.
That car had beautiful lines.

41:54.021 --> 41:58.821
I miss the car. If anybody's watching
the show that bought my car,
please, I want to buy it back.

41:58.821 --> 42:02.021
Yeah, OK. 504 diesel.
Anyone got one?

42:02.021 --> 42:04.101
No, didn't think so.

42:04.101 --> 42:08.181
Anyway, competition-wise, have you
ever done any track driving?

42:08.181 --> 42:10.061
No. Never?

42:10.061 --> 42:13.101
Never. And you've never driven
a car with the gear lever on...

42:13.101 --> 42:16.141
So this was all an entirely
new thing for you out there.

42:16.141 --> 42:18.181
Who would like to see Andy's lap?

42:18.181 --> 42:20.061
AUDIENCE: Yes!

42:20.061 --> 42:22.541
Let's have a look then.
Come on, let's put it up.

42:23.501 --> 42:27.301
There we go, in the brown
C-apostrophe-D.

42:27.301 --> 42:29.621
Are you pleased with that?
A good start.

42:29.621 --> 42:31.221
Yeah, you were.

42:31.221 --> 42:33.701
You actually look quite sinister.
Tell me about it.

42:33.701 --> 42:36.621
Let's have a look
through the first corner.

42:36.621 --> 42:40.141
That's taming its understeer nicely.
That's very good.

42:40.141 --> 42:43.661
Running a bit wide. Everybody
does, though. Forget to break.

42:43.661 --> 42:45.981
Not a good idea. Into Chicago.

42:45.981 --> 42:50.261
Again, it does run wide, that car.
Very safe, very brown.

42:50.261 --> 42:53.421
Slow. Hammerhead, a very tricky
corner here,

42:53.421 --> 42:55.741
though it's a quick left.

42:55.741 --> 42:58.861
Quick right. That's very
well done, though.

42:58.861 --> 43:01.261
That was excellent. Thank you, sir.

43:01.261 --> 43:03.821
A bit slow on the gear change.

43:03.821 --> 43:06.101
This is my lap, baby.

43:06.101 --> 43:09.821
Sounds... I didn't know that
Groucho Marx knew how to drive.

43:09.821 --> 43:13.421
It is... It is slightly Marx-esque.

43:13.421 --> 43:14.661
That was very quick.

43:14.661 --> 43:17.741
Now you've got the tricky part.

43:19.381 --> 43:23.901
This is where most
of our celebrities go off,
but that was nicely handled.

43:23.901 --> 43:26.221
Do you get Gambon right this time?

43:26.221 --> 43:29.301
Beautifully cut, taking the actual
Gambon line, and there we are.

43:29.301 --> 43:31.461
APPLAUSE

43:31.461 --> 43:33.501
Well done.

43:40.061 --> 43:44.341
Where do you think you've come on
our relatively new board?

43:44.341 --> 43:48.861
You don't know any of these names,
do you? I know Angelina Jolie.

43:48.861 --> 43:51.781
She didn't look
quite like I thought.

43:51.781 --> 43:54.581
She was kind of fat and a bit bald.

43:54.581 --> 43:58.261
Might have been a comedian
pretending to be Angelina. I see.

43:58.261 --> 44:03.821
Louie Spence, you don't know him,
presumably. No, but I certainly
would like to be ahead of him.

44:03.821 --> 44:07.341
No, you don't want to be
in front of him. Oh, I see.

44:07.341 --> 44:09.821
So, Andy...

44:09.821 --> 44:11.461
Garcia.

44:11.461 --> 44:14.261
You did it in one minute...

44:15.421 --> 44:19.301
46.1,

44:19.301 --> 44:21.661
which means, I think,

44:21.661 --> 44:23.821
that you are...
APPLAUSE

44:25.821 --> 44:29.301
..the third fastest driver
we've ever had.

44:30.901 --> 44:32.381
That's not bad.

44:37.581 --> 44:42.181
I think, for a man who's never
driven on the correct side of
a car before,

44:42.181 --> 44:44.181
that's very, very impressive.

44:44.181 --> 44:47.981
And it's just been a huge pleasure
and an honour to have you here.

44:47.981 --> 44:51.381
Ladies and gentlemen, Andy Garcia.
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

44:57.381 --> 44:59.661
Now...

44:59.661 --> 45:04.101
Earlier on, we were told
to invent motorhomes

45:04.101 --> 45:07.101
that were cool and would prove
so successful

45:07.101 --> 45:10.821
they would rid this country
of the caravan menace forever.

45:10.821 --> 45:14.821
The results so far have been,
well, mixed, but no matter.

45:14.821 --> 45:18.421
We rejoin the action after spending
the night trying to sleep through

45:18.421 --> 45:20.901
what felt like a force-nine gale.

45:24.901 --> 45:28.101
'The next morning, mercifully,
the wind had died down.

45:28.101 --> 45:30.981
'But it had taken its toll.

45:32.181 --> 45:33.741
Oh, dear.

45:35.861 --> 45:38.541
Oh, look. It's done the same
in the games room?

45:38.541 --> 45:42.621
Yeah, brought the roof down onto
the pool table. And the living room
and the cinema.

45:42.621 --> 45:46.021
I promise you, Hammond, it was worse
for me. How can it be worse for you?

45:46.021 --> 45:47.901
The roof fell in on my library.

45:47.901 --> 45:50.941
I promise you it was worse for me.
What's worse than that?

45:52.701 --> 45:54.701
Oh, yeah. That's worse.

45:56.501 --> 45:58.501
Morning. Oh, God.

45:58.501 --> 46:00.741
Is that just the wind did that?

46:00.741 --> 46:04.221
Oh, yeah. No, a big giant came.

46:04.221 --> 46:08.701
'After a revolting breakfast
in Hammond's citadel,

46:08.701 --> 46:13.021
'Jeremy pulled out all the stops
to get his Citroen righted.'

46:13.021 --> 46:17.741
So we've had cold beans. Yep. I'm
sorry I didn't eat your raw bacon.

46:17.741 --> 46:19.421
At least I remembered them.

46:21.341 --> 46:25.061
That is my Japanese garden.
Look at it. Just leaking.

46:25.061 --> 46:26.581
Still, it's the right way up.

46:26.581 --> 46:28.621
Oh, hello. Oh, God.

46:31.061 --> 46:33.181
Thank you.

46:33.181 --> 46:37.061
"Since you are in Cornwall,
you must try surfing."

46:37.061 --> 46:40.221
I don't want to do surfing.
What if we just don't want to do it?

46:40.221 --> 46:43.101
What if we just say,
"No, we're not going to"?

46:43.101 --> 46:44.701
Apparently we ARE going to.

46:44.701 --> 46:45.941
There's more.

46:45.941 --> 46:50.141
"You must drive to a nearby beach
and get changed into wetsuits

46:50.141 --> 46:52.421
"inside your motorhomes."

46:52.421 --> 46:55.461
HE CHUCKLES

46:55.461 --> 46:58.701
Sorry, I'm suddenly
feeling cheered up.

46:58.701 --> 47:01.821
Have you ever tried to put...
What, wetsuits or...? Well, suits.

47:01.821 --> 47:03.781
Have you ever tried to put them on?

47:03.781 --> 47:06.501
You need... You see this field?

47:06.501 --> 47:09.781
You need an area this big,
which you have, but it's here,

47:09.781 --> 47:13.101
so you've got to parcel all that up
to drive to the...

47:13.101 --> 47:15.101
And you!

47:16.821 --> 47:19.701
'But Clarkson was laughing too soon,

47:21.021 --> 47:24.221
'because I had planned
for such an eventuality.'

47:24.221 --> 47:27.781
Simply retract the roof. Easy.

47:29.381 --> 47:31.181
It's like a spaceship, you see.

47:31.181 --> 47:34.741
You end up with this escape pod
that can just break free.

47:36.341 --> 47:39.181
'Meanwhile, James and I
had arrived at the beach.'

47:39.181 --> 47:42.261
Look at this. Surftown UK.

47:42.261 --> 47:44.941
They're going to look at my
hat and they're going to say,

47:44.941 --> 47:49.621
"Yes, yes, that man
knows what he's doing."

47:49.621 --> 47:54.221
'And with no sign of Hammond, we
decided to have a surfing lesson.'

47:54.221 --> 47:56.301
Hang on. So it's a...

47:57.821 --> 47:59.701
Yeah, yeah, you've got it.

47:59.701 --> 48:02.941
Is that roughly right? It wasn't,
though, was it? Not really, no.

48:02.941 --> 48:06.581
'Eventually, Hammond's escape pod
was free...

48:08.181 --> 48:10.261
'..and he was able to join us

48:10.261 --> 48:14.541
'for the "getting into a wetsuit
in a motorhome" test.'

48:15.541 --> 48:19.501
Yes! I'll get changed
in my contemplation zone.

48:19.501 --> 48:21.141
Lovely job.

48:21.141 --> 48:24.981
'Unsurprisingly,
it was much harder in the Lotus.'

48:24.981 --> 48:27.821
Ow! Ow!

48:27.821 --> 48:32.901
'But surprisingly, even harder
in Hammond's land cottage.'

48:34.421 --> 48:37.861
I, er, have had to leave some of
the panels at the campsite.

48:37.861 --> 48:39.901
Well, all of them, pretty much.

48:39.901 --> 48:42.101
And that, er...

48:42.101 --> 48:46.061
That has sort of
compromised privacy, rather.

48:46.061 --> 48:49.181
They're not going to go, are they?

48:49.181 --> 48:52.141
If I maybe...

48:54.661 --> 48:56.981
No. Er...

48:59.861 --> 49:01.901
I've had a very clever idea,
I think.

49:01.901 --> 49:06.221
I do of course have my escape chute,
which leads directly into
the back seat of the car.

49:06.221 --> 49:09.421
It's a way of moving between the car
and the bedding area

49:09.421 --> 49:12.701
without having to go outside
if it's raining, for example.

49:12.701 --> 49:15.941
So when I've got the bottom half on,
I'm going to exit

49:15.941 --> 49:20.461
and enter the car
and then slip into the top bit
down there where I can sit up.

49:20.461 --> 49:26.261
'Hammond, meanwhile,
had abandoned the Land Rover
and stolen a child's tent.'

49:28.621 --> 49:29.781
OK.

49:31.021 --> 49:32.501
OK.

49:32.501 --> 49:36.621
I'm not sure that the escape chute
actually works. Hang on a minute.

49:42.221 --> 49:44.501
I've got my shoulders stuck.

49:44.501 --> 49:49.341
'But just several hours later,
my colleagues were ready.'

49:49.341 --> 49:51.301
It's cold.

49:51.301 --> 49:53.381
It's really cold.

49:53.381 --> 49:55.061
It's not going to get any warmer.

49:56.381 --> 49:58.701
Well, give it a couple of months,
it might.

49:58.701 --> 50:01.421
Come on. All right, what do we do?

50:03.821 --> 50:05.861
'Without wishing to boast...'

50:05.861 --> 50:07.381
This is quite nice.

50:07.381 --> 50:09.301
'..I mastered surfing very quickly.'

50:09.301 --> 50:10.341
Lovely.

50:10.341 --> 50:13.541
That's the easiest thing
I've ever done.

50:13.541 --> 50:17.661
'But for some reason, the other
two kept trying to stand up.'

50:22.901 --> 50:25.461
Toes on tail, hands on the rail...

50:27.141 --> 50:29.021
I am surfing!

50:32.141 --> 50:35.181
'They were so engrossed
in this idiocy

50:35.181 --> 50:38.421
'they failed to spot
an incoming problem.'

50:38.421 --> 50:40.261
James, we've got to get out.

50:40.261 --> 50:43.101
No! I almost got up.
We've nearly got it.

50:43.101 --> 50:45.261
What? The cars.

50:45.261 --> 50:46.821
Oh, BLEEP, he's right.

50:48.701 --> 50:52.701
'James and Richard rushed
to their cars and legged it,

50:52.701 --> 50:55.421
'whereas I decided to get changed
where I was.'

50:55.421 --> 50:57.021
Ah! Jesus!

50:57.021 --> 50:58.261
'Which went well.'

50:58.261 --> 50:59.861
Agh!

50:59.861 --> 51:01.741
No!

51:03.061 --> 51:04.981
Yes! Come on, Hasselhoff.

51:06.701 --> 51:08.541
That wasn't tense.

51:09.541 --> 51:13.501
'Our next challenge was to cook
a three-course meal in our motorhomes

51:13.501 --> 51:18.221
'using whatever ingredients we could
find at a nearby petrol station.'

51:20.381 --> 51:23.621
Sit rep. Don't like
driving my Citroen,

51:23.621 --> 51:25.501
don't like sleeping in my Citroen,

51:25.501 --> 51:28.661
almost certainly won't like
cooking in it, either.

51:28.661 --> 51:33.461
'Plus, getting to the petrol station
meant taking some back roads.'

51:34.621 --> 51:36.461
Whoa!

51:36.461 --> 51:38.621
What the hell's that?

51:38.621 --> 51:41.861
Well, it was a tree, but now...
A tree?

51:41.861 --> 51:44.741
That was a big one, Jeremy. Oh, no!

51:46.541 --> 51:49.101
'Having pruned most of Cornwall,

51:49.101 --> 51:51.861
'we finally arrived.'

51:53.221 --> 51:55.661
Oh, my God. No, no, no.

51:55.661 --> 51:56.981
BANG!

51:58.021 --> 52:01.221
Now I have crashed into
a petrol station.

52:04.101 --> 52:07.341
Have you not been able to get
changed? Of course I haven't.

52:07.341 --> 52:10.021
You know how difficult it is
to get out of one of these.

52:10.021 --> 52:12.581
I had to get out of it in a coffin.

52:15.181 --> 52:17.381
'In the shop, James said he'd
do the starter,

52:17.381 --> 52:20.741
'Richard the pudding
and me the main course.

52:20.741 --> 52:23.101
'But this was the sticks.'

52:23.101 --> 52:25.901
So, do you have any steak?

52:25.901 --> 52:27.261
Nope.

52:27.261 --> 52:28.741
Pork? Nope.

52:28.741 --> 52:31.461
Er, lamb? Nope.

52:32.621 --> 52:34.701
Bacon?

52:34.701 --> 52:36.261
No, I'm afraid, sorry.

52:36.261 --> 52:38.341
The washers aren't part of the meal.

52:38.341 --> 52:41.101
I've just got those
because I like them.

52:41.101 --> 52:42.741
Do you have any butter?

52:42.741 --> 52:43.861
Mmm...

52:43.861 --> 52:44.901
No.

52:46.261 --> 52:47.941
Lard? Struggling.

52:47.941 --> 52:50.781
Margarine.

52:50.781 --> 52:55.101
'Despite the lack of choice,
we soon had enough for our dinner.

52:57.501 --> 52:59.781
'So, back at the campsite,
we parked up...

53:03.181 --> 53:04.741
'..and got cooking.'

53:04.741 --> 53:08.461
Right, what I'm going to cook
tonight is Spam slices,

53:08.461 --> 53:12.861
coated with a crushed, cheesy,
popular snack item.

53:12.861 --> 53:17.181
So first, using the fork,
we crush up the cheesy comestibles.

53:17.181 --> 53:20.661
Here is what I propose for dessert.

53:20.661 --> 53:24.341
I'm going to make Eton mess
crossed with trifle.

53:24.341 --> 53:26.661
Couldn't find any sponge fingers,

53:26.661 --> 53:30.341
but then I had
an absolutely brilliant idea.
I'm going to use bread.

53:30.341 --> 53:33.181
Lining the bowl
with the sponge fingers.

53:33.181 --> 53:38.181
Now we put our ice cream
and yogurt in, like that.

53:38.181 --> 53:43.501
Right, the water is boiling
so it's time to start
preparing the vegetables.

53:43.501 --> 53:44.901
Here they are.

53:44.901 --> 53:46.421
So, thin slices.

53:46.421 --> 53:51.061
About an eighth of an inch,
or about 2.5 mm in Roman Catholic.

53:51.061 --> 53:56.541
But flavour the flowers with
just a couple of pickled onions.

53:56.541 --> 53:59.821
Chocolate, not a problem.
Any amount of that can go in.

54:03.421 --> 54:04.981
Ow! Ow!

54:04.981 --> 54:06.541
I need a handle for that.

54:06.541 --> 54:08.141
Now...

54:09.221 --> 54:13.701
The oil. This does worry me,
I must admit, using Castrol GTX.

54:13.701 --> 54:16.421
But I don't think I have any choice.

54:16.421 --> 54:18.701
In the meantime, whilst that
just heats up,

54:18.701 --> 54:23.221
we have to consider our "garni",
which is an orange jus...

54:24.181 --> 54:27.541
..taken out of the inside of one
of these chocolate confections,

54:27.541 --> 54:30.621
which is named after a type of
orange where it isn't a brand name,

54:30.621 --> 54:34.221
but becomes a brand name when
applied to one of these,
unfortunately.

54:34.221 --> 54:37.621
So I can't tell you what they are,
but you know they're Jaffa Cakes.

54:37.621 --> 54:41.261
Now I'm monitoring everything
at this point very carefully,

54:41.261 --> 54:46.421
cos the last time I tried to cook on
a campsite, the caravan caught fire.

54:46.421 --> 54:50.461
You may remember. And the one
next to it. So I can't be...

54:51.981 --> 54:53.661
Holy cow. What's that?

54:53.661 --> 54:56.781
Er... Er...

54:56.781 --> 55:01.301
Get an extinguisher, man! I haven't
got one! Who's got an extinguisher?
I've got one there.

55:01.301 --> 55:03.781
Why's there a safety thing on it?

55:03.781 --> 55:07.221
Who's put a health and safety
thing on it?

55:09.661 --> 55:12.181
I've used it all now.

55:12.181 --> 55:13.821
James, are you not going to get out?

55:13.821 --> 55:15.621
I can't. It takes half an hour.

55:15.621 --> 55:17.821
'Hammond then found another
extinguisher

55:17.821 --> 55:21.101
'but unfortunately,
there was a height issue.'

55:22.621 --> 55:23.701
That's not working.

55:23.701 --> 55:26.861
Left a bit. Right.
No, the other way, the other way!

55:26.861 --> 55:28.101
The other way!

55:28.101 --> 55:31.741
This is all working terribly well.
I think mine is going to be ready
quite soon,

55:31.741 --> 55:36.421
but we won't have anywhere to eat it
because I believe the plan was to
eat in Hammond's dining room,

55:36.421 --> 55:38.301
which has just burned down.

55:39.301 --> 55:40.821
Ooh, not good.

55:40.821 --> 55:43.741
He's actually set fire to metal.

55:43.741 --> 55:45.261
How has he done that?

55:48.341 --> 55:50.981
'We decided to abandon the cooking

55:50.981 --> 55:54.701
'and cracked open
a liquid supper instead.'

55:56.221 --> 55:59.741
That's the first time we've seen
the sun, gentlemen, since we...

55:59.741 --> 56:03.701
Well, that makes it worthwhile,
doesn't it? That's not bad. Listen.

56:05.341 --> 56:07.981
All you can hear is just
the creaking of the embers

56:07.981 --> 56:10.981
in his burning motorhome.
Yeah, just my fire.

56:20.421 --> 56:22.421
SHEEP BAA

56:22.421 --> 56:25.341
Just get out! And you! Out! Out!

56:29.381 --> 56:31.181
Oh, God, look at it.

56:33.501 --> 56:35.981
'And on that note...'

56:57.781 --> 57:01.701
'After James had failed to wipe
his bottom with any dignity,

57:01.741 --> 57:04.461
'we decided to go to
a nearby beauty spot.'

57:04.461 --> 57:07.621
James May. Jeremy Clarkson.

57:07.621 --> 57:11.501
What's it like, driving around
under a bucket of your own faeces?

57:11.501 --> 57:15.061
Are you going to fall over
today for our entertainment?

57:19.701 --> 57:23.501
Aaaaargh!

57:23.501 --> 57:26.501
'As we drove along,
we began to realise

57:26.501 --> 57:30.341
'that our motorhoming holiday
hadn't been a great success.'

57:31.341 --> 57:32.501
I'm exhausted.

57:32.501 --> 57:34.701
I'm also pretty cold now.

57:34.701 --> 57:36.581
I don't think I'm going to make it.

57:36.581 --> 57:39.621
Just leave me behind,
I'll only slow you up.

57:39.621 --> 57:42.101
I don't know why I said that.
They will.

57:45.181 --> 57:47.381
Covered in egg and
crisps and Spam juice.

57:47.381 --> 57:50.141
I haven't shaved, I haven't had
a proper wash for three days.

57:50.141 --> 57:54.501
The thing about this exercise is
that it helps you to appreciate

57:54.501 --> 57:56.781
the basic amenities of home life.

57:56.781 --> 58:00.021
You know, a tap, a chair.

58:01.181 --> 58:03.661
'What's more, the speed of Jeremy's
motorhome

58:03.661 --> 58:07.821
'meant that everyone else's holiday
was ruined, too.'

58:07.821 --> 58:10.861
That's a big queue. I'm embarrassed.

58:10.861 --> 58:15.701
That's a really long queue.
I don't think we've sped
up caravanning, have we?

58:21.581 --> 58:24.661
'Eventually, we made it
to the beauty spot.'

58:27.221 --> 58:30.581
Oh, yeah. Now THAT is a view.
This is more like it, yeah.

58:32.101 --> 58:35.501
I think it's fabulous.
Yeah, this is all right.

58:35.501 --> 58:38.741
Right now I'm quite enjoying motor
caravanning. Yeah, I'm enjoying it.

58:38.741 --> 58:42.461
It's the first time since we set off
that motorhoming is making sense.

58:42.461 --> 58:44.661
Guys. What?

58:44.661 --> 58:46.501
There's a pub down there.

58:46.501 --> 58:51.741
Yes, very nice. I'm going to the pub.
I'm going for an ice cream.
Will you bring one back?

58:51.741 --> 58:56.101
I've been thinking about ice cream
for three days. I'll bring you back
an ice cream

58:56.101 --> 58:59.101
and then everyone will go, "They
really do get on, those three."

58:59.101 --> 59:01.221
Yeah, OK.

59:01.221 --> 59:06.461
'While Jeremy was gone,
I'm afraid we hatched a plan.'

59:06.461 --> 59:09.461
See where it drops away
at the edge of the cliff?

59:09.461 --> 59:13.901
If we pushed his car there and just
park it on the edge,

59:13.901 --> 59:16.501
he won't be able to go forwards,
obviously.

59:16.501 --> 59:20.461
No, I know what you're thinking.
Never back it up. That's brilliant.

59:20.461 --> 59:24.661
Go on, stick it down there. He'll see
it from the bottom and he'll see
the tower on the edge.

59:24.661 --> 59:25.861
He's taken the...

59:25.861 --> 59:27.621
Well, push it, push it, push it.

59:31.821 --> 59:33.141
That's good.

59:34.621 --> 59:37.301
Mmm. That's very good.

59:37.301 --> 59:39.101
Handbrake's off.

59:39.101 --> 59:41.981
Just get it right to the edge.
Yeah, yeah.

59:41.981 --> 59:43.581
I reckon if we...

59:43.581 --> 59:45.781
Hang on. Oh, BLEEP.

59:45.781 --> 59:48.981
In weather like this,
among scenery like that,

59:48.981 --> 59:51.981
holidaying in England -

59:51.981 --> 59:54.661
even in a motorhome -
does make sense.

59:54.661 --> 59:57.221
CRASHING

59:57.221 --> 59:59.301
Is that all right?

59:59.301 --> 01:00:00.821
What?

01:00:06.941 --> 01:00:08.461
What's that?

01:00:09.861 --> 01:00:11.901
APPLAUSE

01:00:17.221 --> 01:00:18.901
You ruined it.

01:00:21.341 --> 01:00:25.101
You ruined my Citroen grand design
and you ruined it on purpose.

01:00:25.101 --> 01:00:26.461
It was his idea.

01:00:26.461 --> 01:00:29.581
It wasn't!
We saw in the film, you did it.

01:00:29.581 --> 01:00:33.261
You pushed it off the cliff
cos you knew it was best
and you're a sore loser.

01:00:33.261 --> 01:00:35.141
Jeremy, it wasn't the best, mate.

01:00:35.141 --> 01:00:37.461
It had a top speed of two
and it fell over.

01:00:37.461 --> 01:00:39.541
You couldn't even wipe your bottom
in yours.

01:00:39.541 --> 01:00:43.821
Yeah, exactly. You could wipe
thousands of bottoms in mine,
which is why it was the best.

01:00:43.821 --> 01:00:48.621
Wiping your bottom is not
the only criterion for judging
a successful motorhome.

01:00:48.621 --> 01:00:51.021
Whatever. Point is mine was
brilliant, and you know it.

01:00:51.021 --> 01:00:53.501
It wasn't.
It wasn't, actually. Exactly.

01:00:53.501 --> 01:00:58.221
In fact, we really haven't
reinvented the motorhome at all,
have we? No, I'm afraid we haven't.

01:00:58.221 --> 01:01:02.741
And once again, and as usual, we've
completely wasted your evening.
Sorry. Yes.

01:01:02.741 --> 01:01:05.301
And as a result of
our wretched failure,

01:01:05.301 --> 01:01:10.341
Britain will continue to be
strangled by the glass-fibre menace
of the caravan

01:01:10.341 --> 01:01:14.981
until we all suffocate and
die pointless and agonising deaths.

01:01:14.981 --> 01:01:17.301
Nice to have a plan -
that's the main thing.

01:01:17.301 --> 01:01:20.861
On that bombshell, it's time to end.
Thank you for watching. Goodnight.
