WEBVTT

00:03.045 --> 00:05.457
(snarling )

00:09.260 --> 00:11.251
It's the only way.

00:14.140 --> 00:15.550
No one else knows.

00:15.725 --> 00:17.386
You gonna tell 'em?

00:17.560 --> 00:19.266
Not till after.

00:22.064 --> 00:24.350
We have to do it today.
It has to be quiet.

00:28.988 --> 00:31.730
You got a plan?

00:31.908 --> 00:33.899
We tell her we need
to talk.

00:34.076 --> 00:36.567
Away from the others.

00:44.587 --> 00:46.077
Just ain't us, man.

00:46.255 --> 00:49.247
No. No, it isn't.

00:53.387 --> 00:56.003
We do this,

00:56.182 --> 00:57.922
we avoid a fight.

00:58.100 --> 01:00.056
No one else dies.

01:03.064 --> 01:05.020
All right.

01:06.776 --> 01:09.267
We need someone else.

01:12.907 --> 01:14.363
I'll talk to him.

01:14.533 --> 01:16.194
I'll do it.

01:16.369 --> 01:17.905
- I'll go with you.
- No.

01:18.079 --> 01:20.445
Just me.

01:26.963 --> 01:29.921
(fabric ripping )

01:48.985 --> 01:51.271
Just looking
for a little vacation.

01:51.445 --> 01:55.154
Best dope I ever had
was in a mattress.

01:58.995 --> 02:00.701
Nothing.

02:04.375 --> 02:06.331
This place must have
been no fun at all.

02:06.502 --> 02:07.867
We need your help.

02:08.045 --> 02:10.252
( laughs)

02:20.349 --> 02:24.308
Do you even know why
you do the things you do?

02:24.478 --> 02:26.685
The choices you make?

02:40.661 --> 02:44.279
If we give
the Governor Michonne,

02:44.457 --> 02:45.947
Woodbury stands down.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.746
I don't like it, but it's what needs
to be done.

02:49.920 --> 02:53.083
We need to make it quiet.
We need your help with that.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.926
You ain't told
any of the others, huh?

02:59.096 --> 03:01.883
Just Hershel,
Daryl and you.

03:03.351 --> 03:04.932
Huh.

03:05.102 --> 03:07.058
The inner circle.

03:07.229 --> 03:08.810
I'm honored.

03:08.981 --> 03:11.723
( chuckles )

03:11.901 --> 03:14.438
You know,

03:14.612 --> 03:16.227
when we'd go out on runs,

03:16.405 --> 03:18.817
he'd bash
somebody's skull,

03:18.991 --> 03:21.027
slash somebody's throat,

03:21.202 --> 03:24.069
and he'd say,
"Never waste a bullet."

03:24.246 --> 03:27.079
| always thought
it was just an excuse.

03:31.796 --> 03:33.582
You go on.

03:35.424 --> 03:36.755
Give him that girl.

03:36.926 --> 03:39.884
He ain't gonna
kill her, you know.

03:40.054 --> 03:43.592
He's just gonna
do things to her.

03:43.766 --> 03:46.052
Probably take out
one of her eyes.

03:46.227 --> 03:48.639
Both of 'em, most likely.

03:48.813 --> 03:51.600
You'd let that happen

03:51.774 --> 03:53.856
for a shot?

03:56.946 --> 03:58.686
Whew.

03:58.864 --> 04:01.446
You're cold as ice,
Officer Friendly.

04:06.956 --> 04:08.992
You're gonna need wire,

04:09.166 --> 04:10.952
not rope.

04:11.127 --> 04:14.290
Wire. Nothing she could
chew through.

04:14.463 --> 04:16.294
( chuckles )

04:16.465 --> 04:18.581
Oh.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.465
You know something?

04:21.971 --> 04:24.508
You're right.

04:24.682 --> 04:27.264
I don't know why
I do the things I do.

04:27.435 --> 04:28.925
Never did.

04:30.980 --> 04:33.437
I'm a damn mystery to me.

04:42.032 --> 04:44.409
But I know you, Rick.

04:48.372 --> 04:50.658
Yeah, I thought
a lot about you.

04:50.833 --> 04:53.870
You ain't got
the spine for it.

04:54.044 --> 04:57.002
We need to get her
to the Governor by noon.

05:09.351 --> 05:09.430
(theme music playing )

05:09.435 --> 05:11.391
(theme music playing )

05:46.889 --> 05:48.595
- ( walkers snarling )
- ( Maggie shouting )

05:48.766 --> 05:52.179
- Carl: Hey! Come on! Over here!
- ( pots clanging )

05:52.353 --> 05:54.344
- Hey! Come on!
- Maggie: Over here!

05:54.522 --> 05:56.888
Hey! Right here!

05:58.150 --> 06:00.061
Over here!

06:00.236 --> 06:02.067
- Come on!
- Here! Here!

06:02.238 --> 06:03.569
Come on!

06:03.739 --> 06:08.028
(shouting continues)

06:21.715 --> 06:24.297
Daryl:
Come on, let's go.

06:53.205 --> 06:54.536
They try to drive up
to the gate again,

06:54.707 --> 06:56.447
maybe some blown tires
will stop them.

06:56.625 --> 06:59.788
- That's a good idea.
- It was Michonne's.

07:01.255 --> 07:03.120
We don't have to win.

07:03.299 --> 07:04.789
We just have to make
their getting at us

07:04.967 --> 07:07.424
more trouble
than it's worth.

07:09.305 --> 07:10.966
( gate closes )

07:15.811 --> 07:17.392
Hey.

07:19.648 --> 07:21.354
Let's go.

07:29.825 --> 07:32.111
Ain't no way.

07:32.286 --> 07:35.198
Carol:
What?

07:35.372 --> 07:37.158
Nothing.

07:37.333 --> 07:39.119
What happened here?

07:40.628 --> 07:42.789
We got any whiskey?

07:42.963 --> 07:44.874
Hell, I'd even drink vodka.

07:45.049 --> 07:46.380
Go to hell, Merle.

07:46.550 --> 07:49.166
( laughs)

07:58.354 --> 08:00.310
Are you with us?

08:02.107 --> 08:03.438
Sure.

08:03.609 --> 08:07.773
I'm not talking about
occupying the same space.

08:10.282 --> 08:12.068
Are you with us?

08:13.369 --> 08:16.236
I'm here for my brother.

08:16.413 --> 08:18.699
Well, he's here for us.

08:21.585 --> 08:23.746
It's not time to do shots.

08:23.921 --> 08:26.333
It's time to pick
a damn side.

08:26.507 --> 08:28.589
( laughs)

08:28.759 --> 08:31.592
You ain't like you was
back in the camp--

08:33.222 --> 08:35.008
a little mouse
running around,

08:35.182 --> 08:36.843
scared of her own shadow.

08:38.560 --> 08:41.723
It wasn't my shadow,
it was my husband's.

08:44.066 --> 08:46.899
Well, you don't seem
scared of nothing anymore.

08:48.570 --> 08:50.481
I'm not.

08:50.656 --> 08:52.567
Hmm.

08:52.741 --> 08:54.242
You're a late bloomer.

08:56.412 --> 08:57.902
Maybe you are, too.

09:05.129 --> 09:06.835
Hey.

09:07.005 --> 09:08.506
You seen Merle around?

09:22.396 --> 09:24.478
He say he was sorry yet?

09:29.945 --> 09:31.446
'Cause he is.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.946
He's gonna make it right.

09:39.121 --> 09:40.611
I'm gonna make him.

09:40.789 --> 09:43.075
There's got to be a way.

09:45.461 --> 09:47.952
Just needs to be a little
forgiveness is all.

09:53.010 --> 09:54.966
He tied me to a chair,

09:55.137 --> 09:57.844
beat me, and threw
a walker in the room.

09:58.015 --> 09:59.596
Maybe I could call it even.

09:59.767 --> 10:01.132
But he--

10:01.310 --> 10:03.847
he took Maggie to a man
who terrorized her,

10:04.021 --> 10:05.852
humiliated her.

10:07.816 --> 10:10.307
I care more about her
than I care about me.

10:30.589 --> 10:33.001
(metal clinking)

10:33.175 --> 10:35.006
Merle.

10:35.177 --> 10:37.168
You down here?

10:40.891 --> 10:42.631
Merle.

10:48.649 --> 10:50.640
Hey, little brother.

10:50.818 --> 10:52.649
What the hell?

10:52.820 --> 10:55.186
l was just about
to holler back at ya.

10:57.449 --> 10:59.030
What you doing down here?

10:59.201 --> 11:02.193
Just looking for
a little crystal meth.

11:04.206 --> 11:07.039
Yeah, yeah, I know.

11:07.209 --> 11:09.621
Shit will mess
my life up

11:09.795 --> 11:12.537
when everything is
going so sweet, right?

11:12.714 --> 11:14.454
( laughs)

11:14.633 --> 11:16.123
You talk to Rick yet?

11:16.301 --> 11:19.634
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
I'm in.

11:19.805 --> 11:21.796
But, uh,

11:21.974 --> 11:23.680
he ain't got
the stomach for it.

11:25.102 --> 11:27.844
He's gonna buckle.
You know that, right?

11:28.021 --> 11:29.557
Yeah.

11:29.731 --> 11:31.858
If he does, he does.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.731
You want him to?

11:37.406 --> 11:38.816
Whatever he says goes.

11:38.991 --> 11:41.403
( scoffs )
Man.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.822
Do you even possess

11:44.997 --> 11:47.079
a pair of balls,
little brother?

11:47.249 --> 11:49.365
Are they even attached?

11:49.543 --> 11:53.411
I mean, if they are,
do they belong to you?

11:53.589 --> 11:57.002
You used to call people
like that sheep.

11:57.175 --> 11:59.257
What happened to you?

11:59.428 --> 12:03.671
What happened
with you and Glenn

12:03.849 --> 12:05.464
and Maggie?

12:05.642 --> 12:07.678
I've done worse.

12:11.189 --> 12:13.441
You need to grow up.

12:13.609 --> 12:15.600
Things are different now.

12:20.782 --> 12:24.366
Your people look at me
like I'm the devil...

12:26.705 --> 12:30.323
grabbing up those lovebirds
like that, huh?

12:30.500 --> 12:33.788
Now y'all want to do
the same damn thing I did--

12:33.962 --> 12:36.169
snatch someone up
and deliver them to the Governor,

12:36.340 --> 12:38.547
just like me.

12:38.717 --> 12:40.457
Yeah.

12:40.636 --> 12:43.719
People do what they
got to do or they die.

12:45.057 --> 12:48.390
Can't do things without
people anymore, man.

12:48.560 --> 12:51.472
( scoffs )

12:51.647 --> 12:54.810
Maybe these people need
somebody like me around, huh?

12:54.983 --> 12:57.599
Do their dirty work.

12:59.488 --> 13:02.150
The bad guy.

13:02.324 --> 13:04.781
Yeah, maybe that's how
it is now, huh?

13:06.954 --> 13:08.569
How does that hit you?

13:13.585 --> 13:16.042
ljust want
my brother back.

13:18.423 --> 13:19.924
Get out of here, man.

13:38.777 --> 13:42.690
Hershel:
"Thou shalt not be afraid

13:42.864 --> 13:44.729
for the terror by night.

13:44.908 --> 13:49.868
Nor for the arrow
that flieth by day.

13:51.832 --> 13:56.542
Nor for the pestilence
that walketh in darkness.

13:56.712 --> 14:00.250
Nor for the destruction

14:00.424 --> 14:03.587
that wasteth at noonday.

14:07.014 --> 14:10.506
1,000 shall fall at thy side

14:10.684 --> 14:14.552
and 10,000
at thy right hand.

14:17.065 --> 14:19.807
But it shall not come
nigh thee.

14:23.989 --> 14:25.900
Only with thine eyes

14:26.074 --> 14:28.110
shalt thou behold

14:28.285 --> 14:31.277
and see the reward
of the wicked.

14:35.500 --> 14:39.038
Surely He shall
deHverthee

14:39.212 --> 14:41.703
from the snare
of the fowler

14:41.882 --> 14:44.874
and from the noisome
pestilence."

14:45.052 --> 14:47.259
You're not there.

14:48.847 --> 14:51.179
She's not there.

14:57.606 --> 14:58.937
Hershel:
"He shall cover thee

14:59.107 --> 15:02.520
and under His wings
shalt thou trust.

15:05.155 --> 15:08.943
There shall no evil
befall thee.

15:11.787 --> 15:15.780
Neither shall any plague
come nigh thy dwelling."

15:22.172 --> 15:24.458
You okay?

15:26.843 --> 15:28.959
What I wouldn't do

15:29.137 --> 15:30.843
to keep you two safe.

15:31.014 --> 15:32.550
( door opens)

15:32.724 --> 15:35.010
Rick?

15:37.979 --> 15:39.355
What you're
about to do--

15:39.523 --> 15:41.559
I can't.

15:43.318 --> 15:45.183
I won't.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.111
- Michonne: So where is it?
- Merle: Around the corner.

15:52.285 --> 15:53.616
We got to clear
some walkers,

15:53.787 --> 15:55.323
then get the others
down here to barricade it.

15:55.497 --> 15:58.830
A breach like this could be
an open invitation to the Governor.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.838
He's not much
for subtlety.

16:07.008 --> 16:09.841
(snarling )

16:11.388 --> 16:13.674
You want to take
yourchances?

16:27.112 --> 16:28.727
(grunts)

17:09.404 --> 17:11.235
Governor made Rick
an offer.

17:11.406 --> 17:15.240
Turn you over and we all give
peace a chance.

17:15.410 --> 17:17.492
I agree with you, though.
He would have blinked.

17:17.662 --> 17:19.573
Butnotyou.

17:19.748 --> 17:21.079
( scoffs )

17:21.249 --> 17:22.750
I'm being
straight with you.

17:22.918 --> 17:25.034
You were straight
when you led me into the tombs.

17:25.212 --> 17:26.873
Okay, maybe
I wasn't straight.

17:27.047 --> 17:28.708
You put a bag
over my head.

17:28.882 --> 17:30.793
I got it done.

17:30.967 --> 17:32.377
He wouldn't have.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.543
Keep moving.

17:38.141 --> 17:41.304
He was a guy that came back
for me on that rooftop.

17:41.478 --> 17:43.309
Nah.

17:43.480 --> 17:46.096
It's all on me.

17:46.274 --> 17:48.139
You know?

17:48.318 --> 17:51.936
I figure that's why I was back
there in the first place.

17:52.113 --> 17:53.944
Do the dirty work.

17:54.115 --> 17:57.073
(walker growling )

17:57.244 --> 18:00.281
(laughing)

18:03.875 --> 18:05.376
May I?

18:08.797 --> 18:10.287
I'll take that as a yes.

18:10.465 --> 18:12.672
(growling)

18:22.310 --> 18:25.097
( laughs)

18:25.272 --> 18:26.762
Oh!

18:26.940 --> 18:29.306
You know what?
I'd figured you would have run.

18:31.486 --> 18:34.023
Wanted my sword back
before I get away.

18:34.197 --> 18:36.313
( laughs)

18:36.491 --> 18:39.324
It may go down
that way.

18:39.494 --> 18:42.156
But if I were you,

18:42.330 --> 18:43.991
I wouldn't get
my hopes up.

18:49.337 --> 18:51.248
Move.

18:57.595 --> 18:59.847
It's off.
We'll take our chances.

19:00.015 --> 19:01.551
I'm not saying
it was the wrong call,

19:01.725 --> 19:04.011
but this is definitely
the right one.

19:04.185 --> 19:06.176
What's wrong?

19:06.354 --> 19:08.140
I can't find Merle
or Michonne.

19:08.315 --> 19:10.180
They've gone.

19:10.358 --> 19:12.098
Come on.

19:17.532 --> 19:18.863
He was in here.

19:19.034 --> 19:20.820
Said he was looking
for drugs.

19:20.994 --> 19:23.576
Said a lot of things, actually.

19:23.747 --> 19:25.078
Like what?

19:25.248 --> 19:28.081
Said that you were gonna
change your mind. Here we go.

19:29.711 --> 19:31.622
Yeah, he took her here.
They mixed it up.

19:31.796 --> 19:34.253
Damn it!
I'm going after him.

19:34.424 --> 19:36.961
- You can't track for shit.
- Then the both of us.

19:37.135 --> 19:38.124
No, just me.

19:38.303 --> 19:40.760
I said I'd go and I'll go.

19:40.930 --> 19:42.261
Plus they're gonna
come back here.

19:42.432 --> 19:44.093
You need to be ready.

19:44.267 --> 19:45.928
Your family, too.

19:50.148 --> 19:52.104
I want to be
with my brother.

19:54.194 --> 19:57.061
My brother, he wants
to be in the prison.

20:00.116 --> 20:02.072
This little trip...

20:04.371 --> 20:07.488
maybe it'll keep
that place standing.

20:09.250 --> 20:11.787
lfl pull it off,
maybe all is forgiven.

20:13.755 --> 20:15.245
That's a whole lot
of maybes.

20:17.926 --> 20:19.917
You got to play
the hand you're dealt.

20:20.095 --> 20:22.256
| only got one.

20:35.944 --> 20:37.650
You talk about the weight

20:37.821 --> 20:40.107
of what you have to do,

20:40.281 --> 20:42.442
how you can handle it.

20:42.617 --> 20:44.482
A bad man,

20:44.661 --> 20:46.947
someone truly evil,

20:47.122 --> 20:49.613
they're light as a feather.

20:49.791 --> 20:51.782
They don't feel a thing.

20:53.461 --> 20:56.919
I've killed 16 men
since all this went down.

21:01.136 --> 21:03.843
- Let's go.
- ( walkers snarling )

21:18.778 --> 21:20.439
Look at what
that bastard's done.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.319
Look at us.

21:22.490 --> 21:24.606
He's one man.

21:24.784 --> 21:26.240
There'll be others
like him.

21:26.411 --> 21:28.493
There always have been.

21:28.663 --> 21:32.451
I know.
It's like the walkers.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.616
There's nothing
we can do.

21:49.476 --> 21:51.341
When you gave me this...

21:53.688 --> 21:57.351
I didn't fully understand
what it meant.

22:00.069 --> 22:02.606
Such a simple thing.

22:04.991 --> 22:07.198
I know what it means now.

22:09.037 --> 22:10.868
I know what it takes.

22:17.795 --> 22:20.047
I want to marry Maggie.

22:21.382 --> 22:23.043
And we don't have
to have a wedding.

22:23.218 --> 22:24.879
I don't even know
if we'll last the week.

22:25.053 --> 22:28.762
But I want her to know

22:28.932 --> 22:31.799
before...

22:31.976 --> 22:33.477
who knows?

22:35.188 --> 22:37.099
You have my blessing.

22:43.029 --> 22:44.565
Thank you.

23:03.424 --> 23:05.039
All right.

23:05.218 --> 23:06.708
lthink we're good.

23:06.886 --> 23:09.298
Yeah, we're great.

23:57.478 --> 24:00.140
(engine sputtering )

24:00.315 --> 24:02.306
Come on.

24:03.985 --> 24:05.816
- ( engine starts)
- Yeah!

24:05.987 --> 24:09.024
That's the deal.

24:09.198 --> 24:11.450
- ( car alarm blaring )
- Oh, shit.

24:17.582 --> 24:20.244
(walkers snarling )

24:31.012 --> 24:32.127
Merle!

24:34.182 --> 24:35.672
Come on, Merle!

24:40.688 --> 24:42.349
Merle!

25:02.377 --> 25:05.210
Okay. Okay.

25:05.380 --> 25:08.247
( alarm chirps,
blaring stops)

25:08.424 --> 25:10.335
Ah!

25:33.950 --> 25:36.282
Come on.

25:36.452 --> 25:38.443
Let's go!

25:46.254 --> 25:49.462
(tires squealing )

26:07.692 --> 26:10.900
So is this your thing, then?
You take out the trash?

26:11.070 --> 26:13.277
Don't be so hard
on yourself, darlin'.

26:13.448 --> 26:16.030
The Governor, Rick,

26:16.200 --> 26:17.701
anyone who needs
their piss bucket emptied

26:17.869 --> 26:19.359
and you come a-running.

26:19.537 --> 26:22.279
( laughs)

26:22.457 --> 26:24.243
Things are different
for your brother.

26:24.417 --> 26:26.203
Yeah, they are.

26:26.377 --> 26:29.039
Rick says jump
and he wants to know how high.

26:29.213 --> 26:31.124
Mm-mmm.
Rick needs him.

26:31.299 --> 26:33.039
Respects him.

26:33.217 --> 26:35.549
He didn't ask him to do
this littlejob, now, did he?

26:35.720 --> 26:38.632
No, 'cause he wants it done.

26:38.806 --> 26:40.888
You keep telling
yourself that.

26:42.310 --> 26:45.177
The truth is this could
have been your shot.

26:45.354 --> 26:49.017
With your skills,
a whole new beginning.

26:50.651 --> 26:53.734
But you choose
to stay on the outside.

26:57.158 --> 26:59.444
No one's gonna mourn you,

26:59.619 --> 27:01.655
not even Daryl.

27:03.080 --> 27:05.036
He's got a new family.

27:05.208 --> 27:08.496
You keep trying
to get under my skin,

27:08.669 --> 27:10.625
I'm gonna cut
that tongue out.

27:10.797 --> 27:13.163
Your buddy's
turning you over

27:13.341 --> 27:15.832
'cause he's trying
to save his own ass.

27:17.804 --> 27:20.591
You're as much
on the outside as lam, girl.

27:21.891 --> 27:23.677
Maybe.

27:25.520 --> 27:26.851
But once the Governor's
done with me,

27:27.021 --> 27:29.262
at least I won't have
to live with myself.

27:34.695 --> 27:37.687
(walkers growling )

28:03.975 --> 28:05.590
( bones crunch )

28:18.614 --> 28:23.153
You said you killed 16 men
since this thing started?

28:25.329 --> 28:28.412
You ever kill
anyone before?

28:28.583 --> 28:30.824
No.

28:32.169 --> 28:34.581
And how about
before Woodbury?

28:34.755 --> 28:36.666
Before you met him?

28:39.427 --> 28:41.884
Huh.

28:42.054 --> 28:44.340
So he saves your life,

28:44.515 --> 28:46.255
cleans you up,

28:46.434 --> 28:48.390
fed you a line of bullshit.

28:48.561 --> 28:51.177
Why would you kill
somebody else for him?

28:53.566 --> 28:55.306
You know, we can go back.

28:55.484 --> 28:57.190
( chuckles )

28:57.361 --> 28:58.692
Ain't happening.

28:58.863 --> 29:00.603
Both of us.

29:00.781 --> 29:02.692
We can just go back.

29:08.998 --> 29:11.785
I can't go back.

29:11.959 --> 29:14.450
Don't you understand that?

29:14.629 --> 29:16.290
I can't.

29:18.299 --> 29:19.630
Why?

29:19.800 --> 29:21.791
( brakes squealing )

29:47.119 --> 29:48.575
You go back with them.

29:48.746 --> 29:50.828
Get ready for what's next.

29:56.337 --> 29:58.544
I got something
I got to do on my own.

30:46.637 --> 30:48.502
(snarling )

30:48.681 --> 30:50.546
Hey!

30:50.725 --> 30:53.137
Where's my brother?

30:56.522 --> 30:58.058
You kill him?

31:01.444 --> 31:03.150
He let me go.

31:03.320 --> 31:05.606
Don't let anyone
come after me.

31:12.788 --> 31:15.780
( music playing
over radio )

31:22.006 --> 31:24.998
( music continues)

31:39.482 --> 31:41.598
( laughs)

31:53.037 --> 31:55.028
(turns up volume)

32:19.980 --> 32:22.141
( music continues)

33:08.654 --> 33:11.020
( music continues)

33:19.582 --> 33:21.243
Man:
Where's it coming from?

33:21.417 --> 33:23.658
Come on, come on.
With me.

33:23.836 --> 33:26.623
We'll have to spread out!

33:26.797 --> 33:29.038
You two with me.

33:31.051 --> 33:32.666
Walkers!

33:34.221 --> 33:35.677
All over!

33:38.851 --> 33:41.388
Where's Michonne?

33:59.079 --> 34:01.912
(screaming )

34:03.918 --> 34:06.204
(gunfire continues)

34:25.606 --> 34:27.471
Hey, over there.

34:32.488 --> 34:34.649
(snarling )

34:43.582 --> 34:46.073
(grunting)

34:49.964 --> 34:52.580
You leave him to me!

34:53.968 --> 34:55.128
( groans )

34:59.306 --> 35:00.967
(groaning)

35:01.141 --> 35:02.642
(shouts)

35:08.649 --> 35:11.356
(screaming )

35:14.613 --> 35:16.524
- ( arm cracks )
- ( groans )

35:19.159 --> 35:21.195
( choking )

35:23.205 --> 35:25.287
(coughs)

35:28.002 --> 35:29.333
I ain't gonna beg.

35:29.503 --> 35:32.040
I ain't begging you.

35:32.214 --> 35:34.170
No.

35:49.857 --> 35:51.848
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:52.026 --> 35:53.562
Carl was looking for you.

35:53.736 --> 35:55.351
He found me.

35:55.529 --> 35:59.238
I think we should head over.
Rick has something to say.

36:00.576 --> 36:02.032
Uh, just...

36:02.202 --> 36:04.909
one more thing
before that.

36:07.374 --> 36:08.875
Here.

36:27.436 --> 36:28.926
Yes.

37:08.102 --> 37:11.265
When I met
with the Governor,

37:11.438 --> 37:14.271
he offered me a deal.

37:14.441 --> 37:17.683
He said--

37:17.861 --> 37:20.318
he said he would
leave us alone

37:20.489 --> 37:22.855
if I gave him Michonne.

37:26.829 --> 37:29.366
And l was gonna do that...

37:32.418 --> 37:34.500
to keep us safe.

37:43.929 --> 37:45.920
I changed my mind.

37:48.100 --> 37:50.887
But now Merle took Michonne
to fulfill the deal

37:51.061 --> 37:52.221
and Daryl went
to stop him

37:52.396 --> 37:54.387
and I don't know
if it's too late.

37:58.652 --> 38:01.485
l was wrong
not to tell you.

38:05.117 --> 38:07.073
And I'm sorry.

38:10.539 --> 38:12.404
What I said last year,

38:12.583 --> 38:14.494
that first night

38:14.668 --> 38:16.204
after the farm...

38:18.589 --> 38:20.625
it can't be like that.

38:20.799 --> 38:22.835
It can't.

38:23.010 --> 38:26.798
What we do,
what we're willing to do,

38:26.972 --> 38:30.681
who we are,
it's not my call.

38:30.851 --> 38:32.512
It can't be.

38:34.771 --> 38:37.558
I couldn't sacrifice one of us
for the greater good

38:37.733 --> 38:41.191
because we are
the greater good.

38:41.361 --> 38:43.443
We're the reason
we're still here,

38:43.614 --> 38:45.775
not me.

38:45.949 --> 38:48.201
This is life and death.

38:48.368 --> 38:50.529
How you live...

38:52.039 --> 38:54.121
how you die--

38:54.291 --> 38:55.997
it isn't up to me.

38:56.168 --> 38:59.285
I'm not your Governor.

38:59.463 --> 39:02.045
We choose to go.

39:02.216 --> 39:06.505
We choose to stay.

39:06.678 --> 39:08.543
We stick together.

39:11.475 --> 39:13.511
We vote.

39:13.685 --> 39:15.550
We can stay
and we can fight

39:15.729 --> 39:18.971
or we can gO.

40:06.655 --> 40:08.646
(munching)

40:47.487 --> 40:50.229
(snarling )

41:06.506 --> 41:09.498
(crying)

41:31.531 --> 41:33.908
No!

41:47.255 --> 41:50.042
- ( grunts)
- ( growling)

42:00.477 --> 42:03.219
(crying)

42:22.916 --> 42:22.950
(theme music playing )

42:22.958 --> 42:25.916
(theme music playing )
