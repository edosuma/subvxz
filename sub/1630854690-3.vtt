00:10.402 --> 00:11.343
(exhales)

00:11.495 --> 00:13.737
(thudding)
(woman): Please help!

00:13.756 --> 00:15.389
Hello?!

00:17.243 --> 00:19.393
Can anybody hear me?!

00:20.521 --> 00:21.912
Hello?!

00:21.930 --> 00:24.064
(rhythmic music playing)
Hello?!

00:24.859 --> 00:26.316
(volume increases)

00:26.769 --> 00:28.610
Anyone?!

00:30.197 --> 00:32.489
Can anybody hear me?!

00:33.367 --> 00:35.492
(thudding)

00:41.283 --> 00:42.766
Hello?!

00:43.210 --> 00:45.502
Can anybody hear me?!

00:45.954 --> 00:47.454
Anybody?!

00:47.606 --> 00:49.631
(loud music continues)

01:10.796 --> 01:12.696
(man singing along)

01:21.731 --> 01:23.665
(theme music)

01:35.337 --> 01:37.654
- Alright, so this was
the night we got you back.

01:38.173 --> 01:39.489
There was a lady in the car.

01:39.508 --> 01:42.750
So, do any of these girls look
familiar to you?

01:43.253 --> 01:46.330
Look, I-I know this is hard.

01:46.332 --> 01:49.015
- It's not that.
- Look, I wouldn't be asking

01:49.168 --> 01:50.442
if I didn't think
it was really important.

01:50.519 --> 01:53.112
- I can't talk about it.
- Okay.

01:53.188 --> 01:55.948
- Breakfast is served.
- Great, I'm starving.

01:56.099 --> 01:58.433
- Uh, his breakfast.
Not yours. Hmm?

01:58.452 --> 02:01.286
- Downstairs, I saw you making
about 50,000 pancakes.

02:01.438 --> 02:04.514
What, are you trying to spoil
him or induce a diabetic coma?

02:04.516 --> 02:06.850
- I'll settle for fat and happy.
- Hmm.

02:06.852 --> 02:08.127
(chuckling)

02:08.203 --> 02:09.536
- I thought we were
on the same page.

02:09.613 --> 02:12.372
- We are on the same page about
wanting him to heal.

02:12.449 --> 02:15.525
- No, he brought photo albums
into his room, okay?

02:15.527 --> 02:18.470
His baby book. He's trying to
reconnect with his past to heal.

02:18.622 --> 02:22.290
He can't do that and talk about
his abduction.

02:22.368 --> 02:24.626
- I don't know how many times
I gotta say it.

02:24.645 --> 02:27.128
He's not gonna heal until we
find his kidnapper, period!

02:27.130 --> 02:28.722
- Can I have a lock on my door?
- What?

02:28.874 --> 02:31.391
- Why would you want a lock?
- You're kidding, right?

02:31.543 --> 02:33.134
- Sweetie. He's your brother.
- No, he's not. My brother's 11,

02:33.212 --> 02:34.636
sounds like a girl,
and wears Underoos.

02:34.730 --> 02:37.547
- Okay, I know. I know that we
didn't get to see him grow up,

02:37.549 --> 02:39.900
and that is hard.
- It's a "yes or no" question!

02:39.976 --> 02:41.051
- Yes.
(Nikki): No!

02:41.053 --> 02:42.977
- Thank you.
- Okay. Alright.

02:42.997 --> 02:45.480
Um, how's your Beowulf
essay coming?

02:45.557 --> 02:47.499
- It's not, which means
I'm gonna fail English,

02:47.576 --> 02:49.409
barely graduate, and not get
into a good college.

02:49.486 --> 02:52.337
- Okay, how can I help?
- Put a lock on my door.

02:52.414 --> 02:54.231
- At Dad's house,
you can have a lock.

02:54.233 --> 02:56.199
- Whatever. I have carpool.
- Hey!

02:56.201 --> 02:58.251
Keith needs a ride to school.
- What? No.

02:58.328 --> 02:59.736
No, that's not happening.

02:59.755 --> 03:01.829
- His guidance counselor called
and he's able to take

03:01.849 --> 03:04.533
his placement test this morning.
- You didn't tell me about that.

03:04.609 --> 03:06.243
- I was gonna tell you.
- Well, you didn't.

03:06.261 --> 03:08.670
- Okay, great. Well, that means
I don't need to take him.

03:08.747 --> 03:10.580
- He's been out of school
for six years, alright?

03:10.599 --> 03:12.340
They could put him in a
classroom with 12-year-olds.

03:12.434 --> 03:14.251
- Not testing him
won't change that, right?

03:14.253 --> 03:15.694
It just delays the inevitable.

03:17.180 --> 03:18.588
- Okay.
- What?

03:18.590 --> 03:19.681
- What?
- That was your...

03:20.016 --> 03:22.016
That was your talk? She just
told you what to think.

03:22.094 --> 03:23.593
- And now I'm thinking it, okay?

03:23.595 --> 03:25.871
That's why I'm an excellent
ex-husband.

03:25.948 --> 03:27.264
Go take your brother
to school.

03:27.282 --> 03:29.583
- Whatever.
(phone alarm blaring)

03:31.437 --> 03:34.788
(phone buzzing)
- Yes, I'm looking at it now.

03:34.864 --> 03:37.007
(phone alarm blaring)

03:43.449 --> 03:46.132
- CCTV video caught Zoey Roth in
the trunk of a stolen sedan.

03:46.209 --> 03:50.637
We are pulling footage
from major intersections
in a ten-mile radius.

03:50.789 --> 03:53.398
- Zoey's a college sophomore
and she lives here

03:53.517 --> 03:55.625
with her four roommates.
- Have we talked to them yet?

03:55.627 --> 03:57.602
- I texted you that we were
gonna wait for you.

03:57.755 --> 03:59.963
- Sorry, sorry, this morning's
been insane.

03:59.982 --> 04:02.056
- Yeah, honestly,
I didn't expect you two.

04:02.076 --> 04:03.224
- Keith wanted us here, right?

04:03.302 --> 04:04.634
Just because our family's
back together,

04:04.653 --> 04:07.228
doesn't mean we get to stop
helping other families.

04:07.306 --> 04:08.747
- You know, FYI, I'm Team Mike.

04:08.898 --> 04:12.417
- Zoey went missing after a big
party they had here last night.

04:12.494 --> 04:16.171
- How about we show 'em the
video? That'll sober them up.

04:17.258 --> 04:19.149
Do any of you guys
recognize that man?

04:19.167 --> 04:21.818
(tense music)

04:22.429 --> 04:25.489
That's Zoey's license.
The clerk found it,

04:25.491 --> 04:30.060
looked at the security feed,
and uh, called in her abduction.

04:31.680 --> 04:34.014
- Look, our best chance of
finding out where Zoey is,

04:34.166 --> 04:36.349
is for you to tell us
who Zoey is.

04:36.426 --> 04:38.610
You need to be clear
and quick, because...

04:38.762 --> 04:41.280
I don't mean to be blunt
about this, but your friend

04:41.356 --> 04:43.507
has been missing for six hours,

04:43.525 --> 04:45.600
and if we don't find her
in the next 24,

04:45.677 --> 04:48.011
it's a lot less likely
that we ever will.

04:48.013 --> 04:52.198
- Zoey is a digital artist.
Collages, photobashing...

04:52.351 --> 04:56.353
She sold stuff too.
Or did, until she quit.

04:56.371 --> 04:59.131
- Did she ever tell you
why she stopped?

04:59.282 --> 05:01.949
- All I know is she was
at her studio day and night.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.318
Then she wasn't.

05:03.320 --> 05:04.861
- She stopped going a month ago.

05:04.863 --> 05:06.305
- A month ago?

05:06.456 --> 05:08.198
- She stopped going
to school too.

05:08.200 --> 05:10.291
Straight As and then...
just gone.

05:10.369 --> 05:14.128
- Her whole life was upended,
and you never talked about why?

05:14.206 --> 05:16.206
- No, I can't talk about her.

05:16.224 --> 05:17.983
Please, I know you want me to,
but I can't.

05:18.134 --> 05:20.710
- Well, it looks like Zoey
got in a fight.

05:20.712 --> 05:23.805
We found this video
on your social media posts
about the party.

05:24.491 --> 05:27.233
What's not clear is
who she's fighting with.

05:27.386 --> 05:30.220
You see she's arguing with
somebody just off camera,

05:30.238 --> 05:32.889
and when she tries to leave,
whoever it is won't let her,

05:32.891 --> 05:35.876
but our person of interest
is wearing a grey striped shirt.

05:35.952 --> 05:37.669
Ring any bells?

05:38.172 --> 05:40.988
- Um... Okay, uh,

05:41.008 --> 05:42.841
maybe you guys are
a little hungover,

05:43.010 --> 05:46.160
can't remember what happened,
but your phones might have
a picture of this guy.

05:46.755 --> 05:49.239
Can we see your phones, please?
- Not without a warrant.

05:49.257 --> 05:51.165
(chuckling)
- What are you, pre-law?

05:51.185 --> 05:53.593
Hey, counselor,
I got a little story for you.

05:53.745 --> 05:56.337
Let's say that there's a bomb
down in City Hall, okay?

05:56.431 --> 05:58.415
And somehow, because
you're a genius,

05:58.433 --> 06:00.600
you have the deactivation code
on your phone.

06:00.602 --> 06:02.677
Do you give it to me
so I can save a million lives,

06:02.696 --> 06:06.590
or do you wait for a warrant,
and a million people die? Hmm?

06:06.608 --> 06:09.109
Zoey, right now,
she's in the mayor's office.

06:09.261 --> 06:13.455
Your phones, please,
to the lady. Thank you.

06:15.601 --> 06:20.862
- I believe that finding Zoey
requires both fact and faith.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.547
There are evil spirits at work,

06:22.624 --> 06:27.219
and letting me rub these eggs on
you will allow me to fight them.

06:27.295 --> 06:29.537
If you're okay with that.

06:29.615 --> 06:32.391
- Whatever it takes.
- Thank you.

06:32.542 --> 06:35.301
- So, we got this photo off
Sarah Marks' phone.

06:35.378 --> 06:39.139
His name is Matt Calvin,
he's Zoey's classmate and ex.

06:39.215 --> 06:41.900
Friends say that he did not take
the breakup very well.

06:41.977 --> 06:44.051
Apparently, he's obsessed
with her.

06:44.146 --> 06:46.980
- Mike, call campus police,
tell them to find him.

06:47.132 --> 06:48.314
- You don't want to question
the parents first?

06:48.467 --> 06:51.493
- Jay and I can do that.
- Okay.

06:52.804 --> 06:54.471
How's Mom and Dad?

06:54.473 --> 06:56.898
Scrambled, fried,
or sunny-side-up?

06:56.975 --> 06:58.625
- Hopeful. Scared.

07:00.162 --> 07:02.312
Before you guys go talk to them,

07:02.330 --> 07:04.648
I would look at her school file.
It tells quite a story.

07:04.650 --> 07:08.318
- And check out Zoey's studio.
If art was her true love,

07:08.336 --> 07:10.654
we need to know what
made her stop, or who.

07:10.672 --> 07:13.490
- Hmm.
- There must be some mistake.

07:13.508 --> 07:15.917
- No, we spoke
to the university.

07:15.994 --> 07:17.102
Zoey dropped out
three weeks ago.

07:17.329 --> 07:20.254
- What? No. She didn't
say anything.

07:20.274 --> 07:23.333
- Did she ever mention
a guy named Matt Calvin?

07:23.351 --> 07:24.592
- No. Who is he?

07:24.761 --> 07:27.612
- He was the last person
seen with Zoey at a party

07:27.764 --> 07:29.281
at their house last night.

07:29.357 --> 07:31.174
- She told us she was working

07:31.176 --> 07:32.617
on a new piece all week
in her studio.

07:32.694 --> 07:35.695
- I'm afraid she hasn't been
in her studio in a month.

07:35.772 --> 07:38.898
- The person you're describing
is not our daughter.

07:39.050 --> 07:40.441
When Zoey was in high school,

07:40.461 --> 07:42.127
there was no girls
on the football team.

07:42.278 --> 07:44.354
She sued to get
on the boys' team.

07:44.356 --> 07:46.356
- Sweetheart...
- When she found out

07:46.374 --> 07:49.192
that female teachers
made less than men,
she organized a sit-in.

07:49.194 --> 07:50.618
- We're very proud of her.

07:50.696 --> 07:53.029
- And from everything I know
about her, you should be.

07:53.031 --> 07:55.140
- She graduated first
in her class.

07:55.291 --> 07:58.368
CEOs and board chairmen have
pieces done by our Zoey.

07:58.386 --> 08:01.705
She's that good.
That determined.

08:02.224 --> 08:04.131
- Something happened
to Zoey a month ago.

08:04.209 --> 08:05.967
Something that changed her.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.652
We know that that
is hard to hear,

08:07.729 --> 08:10.322
that someone or something
is responsible for your child

08:10.398 --> 08:12.549
being different than the way
you thought that they were.

08:12.551 --> 08:15.452
We understand that,
trust me, we do.

08:16.571 --> 08:19.331
- You have no idea
what it's like.

08:21.168 --> 08:26.079
- Look, I left the force
to work private security.

08:26.231 --> 08:29.007
It was... better pay,

08:29.158 --> 08:32.902
longer life expectancy,
and fewer bad memories.

08:32.904 --> 08:36.848
Okay? But I rejoined the force
when we got our son back.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.059
Okay, our son was taken too.

08:40.354 --> 08:42.687
Obviously, those are
the bad memories.

08:43.431 --> 08:47.433
But when we got him back,
the feeling I had,

08:47.586 --> 08:51.087
the sense of relief,
that's why I'm here.

08:51.106 --> 08:53.514
That is the only reason
I am here,

08:53.516 --> 08:57.852
to make sure people like you
experience that same relief.

08:57.929 --> 08:59.204
And I'm not gonna stop.

08:59.281 --> 09:03.583
Trust me, I will not stop
until that happens, okay?

09:07.105 --> 09:09.214
- What can I do? How can I help?

09:09.365 --> 09:11.441
- You can take care of Paul
and let us do our job.

09:11.459 --> 09:13.960
We get our babies back,
it's what we do. Okay?

09:14.037 --> 09:15.387
- Okay.

09:15.538 --> 09:18.390
- Hey. Campus police
picked up Cal.

09:18.541 --> 09:20.041
- Sex.
- They're bringing him in.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.301
- We need to have some.

09:21.395 --> 09:23.286
- And I haven't even told you
the sexiest part.

09:23.305 --> 09:26.306
- Oh, I miss you.
- I miss you too.

09:26.382 --> 09:28.215
- What could be sexier
than that?

09:28.235 --> 09:31.311
- How about me convincing the DA
that we have probably cause

09:31.387 --> 09:33.296
to use one of the kids' phones

09:33.315 --> 09:36.074
to access Cal's
private group chat?

09:36.225 --> 09:38.151
(tense music)

09:38.303 --> 09:39.819
(school bell ringing)

09:39.896 --> 09:44.332
- Everyone in the administration
is thrilled that you're back.

09:48.255 --> 09:51.006
We know it's been a long time.

09:52.909 --> 09:54.667
Just do the best you can, okay?

09:54.820 --> 09:56.669
You got 90 minutes.

09:56.822 --> 09:59.222
And... begin.

10:11.670 --> 10:13.987
(tense music)

10:15.674 --> 10:17.532
- Don't touch me!

10:18.785 --> 10:20.994
- He wants you in the bedroom.

10:21.938 --> 10:23.696
You know the way.

10:24.199 --> 10:26.750
- I'm not here to do
what he wants.

10:27.535 --> 10:29.127
- We'll see.

10:34.134 --> 10:37.719
- Okay, time's up. Pencils dow--

10:42.384 --> 10:44.200
- I know you're worried about
the Beowulf essay

10:44.202 --> 10:46.870
you have to write,
so I wrote it for you
during my placement test.

10:46.888 --> 10:49.055
- Thanks, but... unlike you,

10:49.132 --> 10:51.399
I'm not gonna pretend to be
someone I'm not.

10:55.563 --> 10:57.304
- I wrote it on Grendel.

10:57.382 --> 10:59.658
I think he's very sympathetic.

11:00.327 --> 11:03.236
- He's a monster
who eats people.

11:03.312 --> 11:06.906
- He was exiled from happiness
and cursed by God.

11:07.058 --> 11:10.001
When that happens,
you do monstrous things.

11:13.823 --> 11:15.507
<i>- Worst case, we homeschool him.</i>

11:15.583 --> 11:17.842
- No, that's a terrible idea,
okay? He's been alone too long.

11:17.994 --> 11:19.419
He needs to be around
other kids.

11:19.571 --> 11:21.162
- What about being
around his sister?

11:21.256 --> 11:23.256
I mean, Sidney is totally
freaked out by him.

11:23.332 --> 11:25.425
- She's got to adjust, okay?

11:25.501 --> 11:27.501
It's an adjustment.
She's gonna come around.

11:27.579 --> 11:29.078
- Well, she'll come around
if we prove it,

11:29.097 --> 11:30.689
if we do a DNA test.
- You can't do that!

11:30.840 --> 11:32.415
It's just gonna tell Keith that
we don't trust him.

11:32.434 --> 11:35.084
- Well, he doesn't have to know.
I mean, take his toothbrush,

11:35.103 --> 11:36.769
the hair from his baby book,

11:36.863 --> 11:38.863
before and after,
and... that's it!

11:39.015 --> 11:40.606
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop.
Hold on.

11:40.683 --> 11:42.275
You really want to do this?

11:42.351 --> 11:44.110
- Do I want to?
No, I don't want to.

11:44.187 --> 11:46.538
- If you don't, then don't.
At least promise me

11:46.689 --> 11:48.097
you won't if he bombs
this other test.

11:48.116 --> 11:49.708
- That's irrelevant.
- It's not irrelevant.

11:49.784 --> 11:54.604
It's proof. It's proof that
he's the sweet, kind, innocent,

11:54.606 --> 11:57.031
terrible student
whose last report card

11:57.050 --> 11:59.167
said that his favorite
subject was dodgeball.

11:59.219 --> 12:02.053
- Fine. I promise, okay? I will.

12:02.205 --> 12:04.781
Now, Cal is in the interrogation
room. I need to ask him

12:04.783 --> 12:06.641
what he knows about Zoey.

12:09.120 --> 12:12.288
- Zoey's interest
is powerful women.

12:12.307 --> 12:14.232
- And the men that ogle them.

12:14.309 --> 12:15.458
- Jacqueline Phillips.

12:15.477 --> 12:17.718
I represent Zoey.
- Detective Adebayo.

12:17.796 --> 12:20.739
- I came as soon
as I heard you were here.
Tell me you have a lead.

12:20.966 --> 12:23.908
- This woman, I recognize her.
- Anything at all?

12:23.985 --> 12:27.078
- It's still early, but every
minute counts. So, the woman?

12:27.230 --> 12:32.208
- Sarah is her model. Her muse.

12:32.978 --> 12:34.753
They were inseparable.

12:35.663 --> 12:38.047
(rattling)

12:43.655 --> 12:45.746
- Hey! Hey! Let me go!

12:45.824 --> 12:46.990
(door slams)

12:47.175 --> 12:50.918
- Her friends said that Zoey
stopped making her art.

12:50.996 --> 12:53.271
Do you know why?
- Well, she didn't stop.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.273
She paused to look
for inspiration.

12:55.424 --> 12:57.517
- Ah. My parents
were collectors.

12:57.593 --> 12:59.110
Actually peed in a piece
of theirs once.

12:59.187 --> 13:01.262
I thought it was a toilet.
Turned out to be a Duchamp.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.782
Clearly, I don't know anything
about art, but um...

13:03.858 --> 13:08.661
But the heart, I understand.
And hers looks broken.

13:09.697 --> 13:10.955
- Well, she's emotional.
- Hmm.

13:11.107 --> 13:12.698
- That's what makes her
a great artist.

13:12.775 --> 13:15.868
- And you don't know any reason
why she'd be that upset?

13:15.870 --> 13:18.021
- None. That's why I'm hoping

13:18.039 --> 13:19.872
this is all just
a big misunderstanding.

13:19.949 --> 13:23.284
- Hmm. Uh, if we need
to contact you?

13:23.303 --> 13:24.694
- Yes. Here's my card.

13:24.712 --> 13:28.640
Please do contact me
the minute you hear anything.

13:28.791 --> 13:30.533
- "Anything is possible."

13:30.535 --> 13:32.869
Hmm. Thank you.

13:32.871 --> 13:35.555
<i> (Nikki): Cal, we know that you</i>
<i> were the one who argued</i>

13:35.631 --> 13:37.298
<i> with Zoey at the party</i>
<i> last night.</i>

13:37.375 --> 13:40.301
<i> - I keep telling you,</i>
<i> I didn't know she was missing</i>

13:40.320 --> 13:41.986
until you told me.
- Mm-hmm.

13:42.138 --> 13:43.988
"Biggest bitch in a town
full of 'em"?

13:44.065 --> 13:46.640
(Cal scoffs)
<i> - If the shoe fits.</i>

13:46.660 --> 13:48.309
<i> - So, we know you were</i>
<i> at the party,</i>

13:48.495 --> 13:52.330
and that you fought,
and then she disappeared.
How does that shoe fit?

13:52.481 --> 13:54.240
- I had nothing to do with that.

13:54.317 --> 13:57.410
- Well, her friends
think you did, and so do we.

13:57.486 --> 14:00.029
That you were a jealous
ex-boyfriend.

14:00.748 --> 14:02.748
And you're obsessed with her.

14:02.750 --> 14:05.234
- Yeah, okay. We fought.

14:05.253 --> 14:06.586
<i>Sarah had gotten a lot of money,</i>

14:06.662 --> 14:08.571
<i> and for some reason,</i>
<i> that freaked Zoey out.</i>

14:08.573 --> 14:11.683
<i> She wanted to protect Sarah</i>
<i> from whoever gave her</i>
<i> all that money,</i>

14:11.834 --> 14:13.910
<i> but Sarah didn't want her to.</i>

14:14.003 --> 14:15.912
- Protect her from who?
What money?

14:15.930 --> 14:17.080
- I don't know.

14:17.248 --> 14:20.341
<i> When I pressed her about it,</i>
<i> she got angry.</i>

14:20.360 --> 14:22.176
<i> I-I get how it looks...</i>

14:22.195 --> 14:27.365
but I wasn't trying to hurt her.
I just wanted to help.

14:29.594 --> 14:31.944
- Mike, what do you got?
- We got a hit on the sedan

14:32.021 --> 14:34.597
three miles south of the gas
station 20 minutes ago.

14:34.599 --> 14:36.282
We're sending units and pulling
feed from that area.

14:36.434 --> 14:39.377
What'd you learn from Cal?
- That Sarah Marks recently

14:39.528 --> 14:40.786
came into a sizeable
amount of money.

14:40.939 --> 14:42.714
For some reason,
that upset Zoey,

14:42.790 --> 14:43.882
a fact that Sarah hid from us.

14:44.033 --> 14:45.958
I'm gonna have Kemi
find out why.

14:46.035 --> 14:49.112
- You are aware that
she's looking for clues
in candle wax, right?

14:49.130 --> 14:51.556
- Mm-hmm. I'm also aware
that dogs smell cancer.

14:51.707 --> 14:54.300
And that if western medicine
was a bit more open-minded,

14:54.452 --> 14:56.561
schnauzers could save
countless lives.

14:56.788 --> 14:59.564
- You know, for a price, I could
get Sarah's financials.

14:59.791 --> 15:01.474
- No. We don't pay for
information. You know that.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.292
- Neither do I.
I pay for shortcuts.

15:03.294 --> 15:06.295
- You mean your hacker friend?
No, please not the collector.

15:06.297 --> 15:08.648
- He still asked about you.
Remember New Orleans?

15:08.800 --> 15:10.742
- What's New Orleans?
- Not fondly, no. Go.

15:10.818 --> 15:14.395
- No? There was this nutria
the size of a Pontiac--

15:14.414 --> 15:15.655
- Out!

15:15.749 --> 15:17.248
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

15:18.067 --> 15:19.417
Okay, so the car's
being tracked.

15:19.494 --> 15:22.236
Sarah's being talked to.
Jay's doing his thing.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.029
That gives us about ten minutes.

15:24.107 --> 15:25.590
- What, to talk about
giant nutria?

15:25.667 --> 15:27.717
- I have a better idea.

15:29.412 --> 15:31.387
(soft music)

15:32.599 --> 15:34.682
God, I missed you.

15:45.837 --> 15:47.278
We should get back.

15:47.430 --> 15:50.022
- You know, I once dated a
married woman who loved peaches.

15:50.175 --> 15:53.284
Yeah, that was her thing.
Peaches made her happy.

15:54.028 --> 15:57.847
So, I got her some from that
gourmet shop on South Second.

15:57.849 --> 16:00.708
You know, the ones that come
wrapped in that gold foil?

16:01.628 --> 16:03.461
I went all out on 'em.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.539
She said she couldn't
take 'em home,

16:06.615 --> 16:09.375
but she promised me
that she would split

16:09.452 --> 16:11.377
with her husband
before they went bad.

16:12.197 --> 16:14.363
So, I put 'em in the mini fridge
in our secret room,

16:14.365 --> 16:16.349
hoping they wouldn't go bad.

16:17.960 --> 16:20.386
And I cried like a baby
when they did.

16:20.463 --> 16:24.298
- You know, Jay...
Jay's part of my old family.

16:24.375 --> 16:30.304
It's just... with Keith being
back, we're just trying

16:30.381 --> 16:32.323
to figure out what that means.

16:32.475 --> 16:34.367
- I know.
- And that takes time.

16:35.737 --> 16:38.162
Our peaches are not going bad.

16:39.815 --> 16:42.208
- We gotta get back to work.

16:46.731 --> 16:50.324
- So, I know you had a fight
with Zoey about money.

16:50.902 --> 16:54.512
Her wanting to protect you
from whoever gave it to you.

16:54.663 --> 16:58.257
- Have you seen Zoey's art?
- And you in it.

16:58.334 --> 17:03.837
Strong, confident woman being
judged by the disapproving man.

17:05.358 --> 17:10.528
- The money came from one
of those disapproving men,
and she hated that.

17:10.679 --> 17:14.774
- Why? What were you supposed
to do for the money?

17:14.926 --> 17:17.260
- Something Zoey never would.

17:17.262 --> 17:19.278
- And because you took it,

17:19.430 --> 17:20.780
she thought that you were okay

17:20.932 --> 17:22.598
with being judged
disapprovingly.

17:22.617 --> 17:24.525
- She thought I was
selling out, yeah.

17:24.602 --> 17:27.620
If I did it once,
I would do it again, and again,

17:27.696 --> 17:31.698
until, to stop doing it, to get
out and do the right thing,

17:31.718 --> 17:34.010
would just be impossible.

17:35.221 --> 17:38.539
That's what our fight
was about last night.

17:38.558 --> 17:41.041
Doing the right thing.

17:41.119 --> 17:42.802
- The right thing.

17:43.379 --> 17:44.954
If you know where Zoey is,

17:44.972 --> 17:48.232
the right thing to do
is to tell us.

17:50.295 --> 17:51.794
- The right thing.

17:51.796 --> 17:54.197
Zoey always knows what that is.

17:54.799 --> 17:57.325
Me, not so much.

18:00.246 --> 18:01.987
- You cannot be serious.

18:02.064 --> 18:04.415
You called me an hour ago.
I'm busting my hump.

18:04.567 --> 18:06.417
And now you say you're not
gonna pay me

18:06.569 --> 18:07.919
because I'm not working
fast enough?

18:07.995 --> 18:10.813
- I gave you the name
of the bank.

18:10.815 --> 18:12.573
- You want the financials,
I'll get the financials.

18:12.592 --> 18:15.318
Those things take time!
- I don't have time, okay?

18:15.336 --> 18:17.095
A girl's life rests on me
getting this information.

18:17.171 --> 18:19.322
- And I understand,
and I'm doing my best.

18:19.324 --> 18:21.324
- Okay.
- It's just, uh...

18:21.917 --> 18:24.160
It's Dad.
- What's wrong with Dad?

18:24.162 --> 18:28.189
- Two months ago, they found,
um... like a lump.

18:29.016 --> 18:31.183
They put him through chemo.

18:31.260 --> 18:34.003
The pills, the diets.

18:34.021 --> 18:35.671
Aromatherapy.

18:35.690 --> 18:38.950
- Mmm.
- Breathing through his eyelids.

18:39.510 --> 18:40.860
- Breathing through his eyelids.

18:41.012 --> 18:42.120
- It's part of
the Durham Protocol.

18:42.271 --> 18:44.104
- I don't have time for this.
- I'm sorry!

18:44.182 --> 18:46.031
Is Dad's illness cramping up
your busy schedule?

18:46.126 --> 18:49.961
- You do this every single time.
- My father's dying!

18:50.037 --> 18:52.021
- And your brother
fell in a well,

18:52.114 --> 18:53.539
and your sister got hit
by lightning,

18:53.633 --> 18:56.025
and your uncle's got jaundice.
I don't know, whatever it is,

18:56.118 --> 18:57.360
I'm no closer to getting
what I came for!

18:57.378 --> 18:59.528
I need this guy's bank records.

18:59.530 --> 19:03.790
- Five K. That's all I need.
(sighing)

19:03.885 --> 19:05.309
For Dad's funeral, you know?

19:05.386 --> 19:06.552
'Cause that would really
help me out.

19:06.629 --> 19:08.479
- He's not dead!
You just said he's alive!

19:08.631 --> 19:09.555
- Well, you gotta plan ahead!

19:09.632 --> 19:11.056
These things move fast,
you know.

19:11.209 --> 19:14.210
- Let me think about it. No,
I'm not giving you any money.

19:14.228 --> 19:16.195
- Fine! It was worth a shot.

19:18.716 --> 19:20.641
Here's the info, cheapskate.

19:21.219 --> 19:23.903
By the way, Dad's hosting a
euchre tournament on Wednesday.

19:24.055 --> 19:26.906
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah! I'll send you an invite.

19:27.816 --> 19:31.894
- Sarah Marks lied. She said she
was paid to be an artist model,

19:31.896 --> 19:34.005
but I find it hard to believe
that an artist is paying

19:34.156 --> 19:37.508
a college kid $25,000,
or that they're paying her
through a Swiss bank account.

19:37.585 --> 19:40.361
- Hold up. The collector's
a garbage man?

19:40.438 --> 19:41.995
Like, he actually
collects garbage?

19:42.015 --> 19:43.664
- Yeah, for tech and finances.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.499
That's how he's able
to access bank records.

19:45.576 --> 19:47.076
- Oh, "access"?
That's what you're calling it?

19:47.169 --> 19:50.855
- And I'd call it a lead
to a college kid who has
a Swiss account.

19:50.932 --> 19:52.857
- To two college kids
who use it.

19:53.008 --> 19:54.917
Uh, Zoey's art studio,
the landlord,

19:54.936 --> 19:56.677
he gets paid from
the same account.

19:56.754 --> 19:58.754
- When I asked Sarah
what happened to Zoey,

19:58.773 --> 20:02.200
she talked about ambition
and doing the wrong thing
to pursue it,

20:02.351 --> 20:04.427
but it sounded like she was
talking about herself.

20:04.445 --> 20:06.946
Like she knows how to help Zoey,

20:07.098 --> 20:09.624
but she doesn't have
the courage to do it.

20:11.436 --> 20:12.768
- I'll do it.

20:13.696 --> 20:16.121
What he paid me for,
but you need to let her go.

20:16.883 --> 20:19.442
No, I didn't tell the poli...

20:20.111 --> 20:22.294
What does it matter
why I changed my mind?

20:22.447 --> 20:25.389
Because it's the right thing
to do, okay?

20:25.466 --> 20:27.725
I need to do the right thing.

20:29.954 --> 20:31.287
You know the address.

20:31.305 --> 20:35.048
- The account belongs to
a financial services company,

20:35.126 --> 20:37.126
but dozens of executives
are part of it.

20:37.144 --> 20:38.811
- Zoey's been missing
for nine hours.

20:38.963 --> 20:40.738
By the time we run each name,
it could be too late.

20:40.815 --> 20:44.133
- But we only need to run
one name. Oh, my God.

20:44.226 --> 20:46.969
- How do you know that?
- Because anything is possible.

20:46.988 --> 20:50.063
Zoey's art dealer gave me this.

20:50.083 --> 20:53.251
For those who are
horticulturally challenged,
that is baby's breath.

20:53.327 --> 20:56.996
In German, a language that
I learned to track Ukrainian

20:57.072 --> 20:58.756
war refugees who are being
sold into slavery--

20:58.907 --> 20:59.906
Yes, that happens.

21:00.151 --> 21:03.094
In German, the word
for baby's breath is...

21:03.170 --> 21:04.336
<i> Schleierkraut.</i>

21:04.913 --> 21:06.580
- H. Schleierkraut.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.749
I want his home
and his office address.

21:08.826 --> 21:11.010
Whatever there is to know
about Baby's Breath,

21:11.162 --> 21:12.177
I wanna know it.

21:12.997 --> 21:15.940
- Baby's Breath
is a billionaire.

21:16.592 --> 21:17.833
A hedge fund god.

21:17.852 --> 21:20.169
Um, no kids, no wife.

21:20.171 --> 21:23.188
Private jets, private parties
with CEOs,

21:23.265 --> 21:26.025
B-list Euros and her.

21:26.101 --> 21:27.343
Jacqueline Phillips.

21:27.678 --> 21:31.104
Zoey's art dealer also curates
Baby's Breath's collection.

21:31.182 --> 21:33.607
- What's a billionaire doing
with college kids?

21:33.626 --> 21:35.684
Sarah talked about expectations.

21:35.703 --> 21:37.962
The pressure that Zoey felt
to live up to her dad's.

21:38.039 --> 21:39.797
Baby's Breath
could help her with that,

21:39.874 --> 21:43.709
but maybe he had something
that he wanted in return, right?

21:43.861 --> 21:44.951
Something she didn't wanna give.

21:44.971 --> 21:48.030
- Hits off CCTV.
All in the past hour.

21:48.049 --> 21:50.290
That's the car
from Zoey's abduction.

21:50.368 --> 21:53.202
- Loop in the sheriff's office,
highway patrol.

21:53.220 --> 21:55.962
Jay and I are paying
Baby's Breath a visit.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.815
- You might wanna
show him this too.

21:57.966 --> 22:00.151
Text messages
from Sarah's phone.

22:00.302 --> 22:02.378
Looks like she does know
what happened to Zoey.

22:02.380 --> 22:05.364
And someone scared her
into not cooperating with us.

22:10.479 --> 22:12.388
- You think that we could
talk privately?

22:12.406 --> 22:14.332
- Sure. I've got
nothing to hide.

22:14.408 --> 22:15.708
Thank you.

22:16.894 --> 22:17.910
- Anything is possible?

22:18.062 --> 22:19.820
- I believe it is. Don't you?

22:19.839 --> 22:21.397
- Why don't you tell us
about Zoey Roth?

22:21.415 --> 22:23.156
- What would you like to know?

22:23.176 --> 22:24.508
- Where she is would be great.

22:24.660 --> 22:26.344
- She was abducted.

22:26.495 --> 22:27.678
- No.

22:27.830 --> 22:29.572
That's awful.

22:29.590 --> 22:30.756
- Yeah, it's awful.

22:30.908 --> 22:32.408
We're interested in the nature

22:32.501 --> 22:33.851
of your relationship with Zoey.

22:33.928 --> 22:36.354
Oh, there was no relationship.
I just bought her work.

22:36.505 --> 22:40.340
- Well, you bought her work
and you paid for her studio.

22:40.401 --> 22:41.917
You gave her friend $25,000.

22:41.936 --> 22:45.087
- Uh, I did not give
money to her friend.

22:45.180 --> 22:46.346
I gave it to her muse.

22:46.424 --> 22:48.591
- Alright. Where were you
last night?

22:48.651 --> 22:49.867
- I was at a dinner party.

22:50.094 --> 22:51.427
For Elon Musk.

22:51.429 --> 22:53.186
- Oh.
- If you want to check it out,

22:53.206 --> 22:54.613
I can get you
his personal number.

22:54.765 --> 22:56.022
- Not, that's okay.

22:56.100 --> 22:58.601
"Say anything and your career
will be over."

22:58.694 --> 23:01.937
"Go to the police and you'll
ever go to medical school."

23:01.939 --> 23:04.289
These are texts
sent from a burner

23:04.366 --> 23:06.050
just hours after Zoey
was kidnapped.

23:06.127 --> 23:09.369
Obviously sent by somebody
who did not want us to know

23:09.389 --> 23:11.389
where Zoey is.
Maybe someone like you

23:11.540 --> 23:13.724
who's on the board
of the medical school

23:13.801 --> 23:15.300
she wants to attend.

23:15.377 --> 23:16.635
- You've done your homework.

23:16.712 --> 23:19.063
- Hmm.
- So have I.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.140
Ex-husband and wife.

23:21.292 --> 23:23.475
You lose your kids.
You help others find theirs.

23:23.552 --> 23:25.978
That must make
every case very personal.

23:26.647 --> 23:29.740
So lemme make this one
very personal for you.

23:29.892 --> 23:31.650
You get the hell
out of my office,

23:31.744 --> 23:34.578
and you stay out until you have
something more substantial

23:34.730 --> 23:38.006
than anonymous texts
and legal wire transfers.

23:38.492 --> 23:39.975
(overlapping conversation)

23:39.994 --> 23:41.977
- What's he talking about?
- Look at these hits from CCTV.

23:41.996 --> 23:43.254
- Bringing up Keith,
making it personal?

23:43.405 --> 23:44.830
I'd like to slap his mouth.

23:44.982 --> 23:46.181
Choke him with that ascot.

23:46.183 --> 23:47.741
- Wait. Ten minutes ago
on Hawthorne.

23:47.760 --> 23:48.759
Jay.
- What?

23:48.911 --> 23:50.410
- Look.
- I'm looking. What?

23:50.504 --> 23:51.820
- Look at where they're going.

23:51.822 --> 23:53.264
Deming, near Hawthorne.

23:53.991 --> 23:56.158
- Sarah.
- Exactly.

23:56.160 --> 23:57.676
(upbeat music)

23:57.828 --> 24:00.396
(muffled screaming)

24:12.434 --> 24:13.451
We're too late.

24:13.527 --> 24:15.602
Nest cam had him here
ten minutes ago.

24:15.680 --> 24:16.862
<i> Sarah's been taken.</i>

24:17.014 --> 24:18.864
- We got a hit that has him
going westbound

24:19.016 --> 24:20.849
on Walnut Street.

24:20.868 --> 24:22.108
- Okay. We're on our way.

24:22.128 --> 24:23.961
Issue an alert.
And keep issuing them.

24:24.112 --> 24:26.021
- I'm not sure that PSP
will go for that.

24:26.023 --> 24:28.966
- One every five minutes.
He doesn't get away.

24:29.785 --> 24:31.785
(engine starting)

24:31.862 --> 24:36.056
(phone alarm sounding)

24:38.844 --> 24:41.036
- I won't do it.
- Of course you will.

24:41.055 --> 24:42.980
It's why you're here.
For Sarah.

24:43.131 --> 24:45.649
To pay her debt.
- That's not why I'm here.

24:45.801 --> 24:47.151
I just came to talk to him.

24:47.302 --> 24:50.546
- The minister's coming tonight
because of her promise.

24:50.548 --> 24:54.474
Henry paid her $25,000
based on that promise.

24:54.994 --> 24:58.704
So put this on,
have a drink. And relax.

25:00.833 --> 25:03.058
He has Sarah.
(sighing)

25:03.060 --> 25:04.001
- That's a lie.

25:04.319 --> 25:06.170
- Well, you know Henry,
so you know it's not.

25:06.247 --> 25:08.214
- That wasn't the deal.

25:09.324 --> 25:11.008
- You know how this works.

25:12.327 --> 25:13.919
Show the Minister
a good time tonight

25:13.996 --> 25:15.937
and all will be forgiven.

25:15.939 --> 25:17.515
For you both.

25:24.248 --> 25:25.689
(door closing)

25:25.766 --> 25:28.567
(muffled screaming)

25:29.862 --> 25:32.446
(phone shutter clicking)

25:36.761 --> 25:37.701
(computer chimes)

25:37.853 --> 25:39.278
- We got it.
Real-time image.

25:39.430 --> 25:43.040
Gas station near
53rd and Market.

25:52.109 --> 25:54.301
(gunshots)

26:04.564 --> 26:07.639
- All we care about
is the girls, okay?

26:07.792 --> 26:08.882
Just getting them back.

26:08.934 --> 26:11.235
- Where are Zoey and Sarah?

26:11.386 --> 26:12.385
Nik!

26:12.630 --> 26:14.154
(groaning)

26:20.062 --> 26:22.321
- Kemi.
We're at the gas station.

26:22.397 --> 26:25.231
We need paramedics. Now.
- Listen to me, hey.

26:25.309 --> 26:27.159
We don't have a lot of time.
This is important. Okay?

26:27.311 --> 26:29.086
Sarah and Zoey,
where are they? Hey, hey!

26:29.163 --> 26:32.047
- EMTs will be here in five.
- Hey, hey!

26:33.317 --> 26:35.834
Let's go, you're not
allowed to die. Come on!

26:35.911 --> 26:38.178
Check it, check it. Go. Come on.

26:39.657 --> 26:41.265
No? Come on.

26:42.676 --> 26:44.509
- Jay.
- What?

26:44.662 --> 26:45.877
- Jason. Jason!
- What?

26:46.029 --> 26:46.937
- He's gone.
- Yeah.

26:47.164 --> 26:48.588
Well then, so are the girls.

26:49.257 --> 26:51.591
- Can anybody hear me?!
(banging)

26:51.611 --> 26:53.193
- Sarah!

26:53.762 --> 26:55.595
- Help me!

26:55.615 --> 26:56.688
(coughing)

26:56.841 --> 26:58.264
(banging)

26:58.342 --> 26:59.358
(yelling indistinctly)

26:59.510 --> 27:02.036
- Sarah! We're gonna
get you out!

27:03.864 --> 27:05.456
- It's okay, it's okay.

27:05.532 --> 27:08.292
You're okay.
You're safe now. You're okay.

27:12.614 --> 27:15.782
- Your parents are on their way
with smiles and lots of hugs.

27:16.193 --> 27:20.045
But before they get here, I need
you to tell me what you know.

27:20.622 --> 27:24.224
Zoey's life may depend on it.
Do you understand?

27:26.628 --> 27:28.220
Good.

27:29.464 --> 27:34.026
The first thing I need to know
is where you were being taken.

27:34.728 --> 27:36.136
- I don't know.

27:36.213 --> 27:39.490
All I know is that it's
somewhere near Haverford.

27:40.551 --> 27:44.662
He used to take us in cars
with blacked-out windows, so...

27:45.389 --> 27:47.831
Now that he doesn't trust me,
he put me in the trunk.

27:47.983 --> 27:50.242
- But you trusted him,
didn't you?

27:50.986 --> 27:54.421
- He was... interested in us.

27:55.341 --> 27:58.400
He made us feel... important.

27:58.493 --> 28:00.094
And...

28:00.846 --> 28:03.138
talented and cared for.

28:04.408 --> 28:08.593
And then, he and Jacqueline
attacked her.

28:08.670 --> 28:09.912
- We need to leave.

28:09.930 --> 28:11.355
- What's wrong?
- I don't want to talk about it!

28:11.432 --> 28:14.174
<i> - And that assault</i>
<i> was shocking and horrible,</i>

28:14.193 --> 28:16.443
<i> and we ran away after that.</i>

28:17.846 --> 28:20.814
And then,
Jacqueline called me.

28:20.891 --> 28:22.199
And...

28:22.350 --> 28:25.277
told me it was all
a misunderstanding.

28:25.429 --> 28:26.704
And...

28:26.855 --> 28:29.448
offered me money

28:29.542 --> 28:31.450
to show some guy a good time.

28:31.526 --> 28:37.047
- So the ambition you told us
about was yours, not Zoey's.

28:38.033 --> 28:40.175
- Or my parents, anyway.

28:42.963 --> 28:44.555
They wanted me
to be a doctor.

28:45.207 --> 28:49.042
If I did anything else,
they would be horrified.

28:49.787 --> 28:53.305
But med schools
are impossible to get into

28:53.381 --> 28:57.151
and he's on the board
of a really great one so...

28:58.053 --> 28:59.737
I took his money.

29:00.314 --> 29:02.481
But then I changed my mind.

29:02.557 --> 29:03.574
- Mm-hmm.

29:03.650 --> 29:05.617
- He was so...

29:07.062 --> 29:10.164
angry when I told him.

29:10.991 --> 29:14.209
He just... exploded.

29:15.829 --> 29:18.255
So I ran to Zoey.

29:19.166 --> 29:21.091
- You told her at the party,

29:22.211 --> 29:26.488
so she insisted
in talking to him, right?

29:26.507 --> 29:28.432
On protecting you.

29:29.602 --> 29:31.660
But then, he texted you

29:31.678 --> 29:35.022
and then threatened not
to help if you talked to us.

29:35.833 --> 29:37.516
Oh, baby...

29:37.668 --> 29:39.017
Zoey stood up for you.

29:39.169 --> 29:42.262
So you decided
to stand up for her.

29:42.965 --> 29:45.365
To do the job,
so she wouldn't have to.

29:49.029 --> 29:51.121
- I saw them in the other room.

29:52.625 --> 29:54.291
Zoey's parents.

29:55.610 --> 29:56.776
I owe them an apology.

29:56.854 --> 29:58.854
- Oh, they are definitely
owed an apology.

29:58.856 --> 30:00.380
But not by you.

30:04.786 --> 30:06.136
Haverford.

30:06.213 --> 30:08.547
Sarah said she was being taken
somewhere near Haverford.

30:08.623 --> 30:10.290
- Her tax rolls have
Baby Breath with a house

30:10.309 --> 30:12.884
in Chestnut Hill and an office
in University City.

30:12.978 --> 30:14.369
Nothing near Haverford.

30:14.371 --> 30:16.388
- Maybe we should ask Paul Roth
for the address.

30:16.540 --> 30:17.889
- Zoey's dad.
Why should we ask him?

30:17.966 --> 30:21.193
- Because our boy Schleierkraut,
turns out he knows him.

30:22.971 --> 30:25.063
- Yeah, I introduced
Henry to Zoey.

30:25.065 --> 30:27.065
- And you both sit
on a foundation board.

30:27.217 --> 30:29.217
One of a dozen boards
Baby's Breath sits on.

30:29.219 --> 30:30.402
- Yeah, I heard
he was a collector,

30:30.554 --> 30:32.904
so I put them together.
Do you know something?

30:33.057 --> 30:34.222
- Does he have a place
in Haverford?

30:34.241 --> 30:35.891
- What difference does it make
where he lives

30:35.893 --> 30:37.075
unless he's involved?

30:37.227 --> 30:38.335
Unless that's where she is.

30:38.562 --> 30:41.171
- All we want is an address.
- I'm gonna kill him.

30:41.248 --> 30:43.156
I'm gonna find him,
I'm gonna get Zoey back,

30:43.175 --> 30:45.491
and I am going to put
a bullet in his head!

30:45.493 --> 30:46.585
- Paul, listen to me.

30:46.737 --> 30:48.828
I told you I know
what you're going through.

30:48.906 --> 30:51.740
What you need to do now,
what Zoey needs you to do now,

30:51.758 --> 30:54.743
is let us do our job. Okay?

30:54.761 --> 30:56.520
(breathing heavily)

30:56.671 --> 30:58.480
- Do you know the address?

31:02.586 --> 31:03.176
- No.

31:03.195 --> 31:04.844
(knocking on door)

31:04.922 --> 31:06.771
- Um... Can we talk?

31:06.848 --> 31:08.681
- You said the eggs would help!

31:08.701 --> 31:10.284
(glass shattering)

31:12.204 --> 31:13.871
You said it'd be okay.

31:14.765 --> 31:17.541
- Okay, so this is one
of Zoey's collages.

31:17.618 --> 31:21.119
And this is what she was
looking at when she created it.

31:21.213 --> 31:22.954
The Schuylkill River
right outside of town.

31:23.107 --> 31:24.606
Thank God Zoey's not a cubist.

31:24.608 --> 31:25.865
Not even my fourth husband
could figure out

31:25.885 --> 31:27.275
the location even if she was.

31:27.294 --> 31:29.553
- You were married four times?
- Twelve, actually.

31:29.704 --> 31:31.630
Once a century.
Number four, that was...

31:31.782 --> 31:34.207
- Ah... Bonaventura Cavalieri.

31:34.226 --> 31:36.560
Student of Galileo.
Inventor of polar coordinates.

31:36.787 --> 31:38.228
Lover of mutton.
You know what I'm saying?

31:38.305 --> 31:39.897
I'm sorry. Okay, um...

31:39.973 --> 31:43.959
The pole. That's Zoey.
And that is her window.

31:43.961 --> 31:46.570
The ray between her window
and the hills

31:46.721 --> 31:48.071
gives us the polar axis.

31:48.223 --> 31:50.148
And the coordinates of the hills

31:50.300 --> 31:52.409
gets you the coordinates
of the house.

31:52.560 --> 31:54.244
All the way down
to Street View guy.

31:54.321 --> 31:55.913
I love Street View guy.
He's so cute.

31:56.064 --> 31:58.473
- Okay. I want warrants
on Schleierkraut's home,

31:58.475 --> 32:01.326
office, get, boat, bathtub.
You name it.

32:01.478 --> 32:02.377
- Gotcha.

32:03.664 --> 32:04.904
- Zoey is a star.

32:04.982 --> 32:06.648
I'd love to show you her work.

32:06.667 --> 32:07.816
- Maybe later.

32:07.834 --> 32:09.834
- Later. Of course.

32:09.987 --> 32:13.096
In the meantime,
the house is all yours.

32:15.993 --> 32:17.392
(door closing)

32:23.517 --> 32:25.233
- Well, Zoey.

32:30.724 --> 32:33.116
Don't you look lovely.

32:39.533 --> 32:41.458
(groaning)

32:42.777 --> 32:44.444
Feisty.

32:44.521 --> 32:46.046
I like that.

32:46.857 --> 32:48.690
- No, no!
(crying)

32:48.709 --> 32:50.050
No, stop!

32:53.864 --> 32:55.263
(whimpering)

32:57.625 --> 32:58.550
Get away from me!

32:58.978 --> 33:01.061
(glass shattering)

33:03.557 --> 33:04.564
I'm not doing this!

33:05.876 --> 33:07.592
- Play time is over.

33:07.744 --> 33:10.153
(screaming)

33:10.638 --> 33:13.281
(grunting)

33:17.997 --> 33:19.904
- It's okay, it's okay.

33:20.057 --> 33:22.949
Hey, hey, it's okay.

33:23.744 --> 33:25.919
We're gonna get you home, okay?

33:26.913 --> 33:28.821
- It's Mike.
About Schleierkraut.

33:28.841 --> 33:30.590
- Okay, can you...?
- Yeah.

33:32.569 --> 33:33.568
- Talk to me.

33:33.846 --> 33:35.754
- Hey, we executed a warrant
on his house. He's here.

33:35.906 --> 33:36.921
- So you got him.

33:37.074 --> 33:39.099
- Not exactly, no.

33:40.668 --> 33:41.351
- Okay, easy.

33:41.503 --> 33:42.835
Come on, you shoot me now,

33:42.855 --> 33:45.413
the cops will come in
guns blazing and you will die.

33:45.432 --> 33:46.356
- Good.

33:46.508 --> 33:49.317
Then we'll both get
what we deserve.

33:53.757 --> 33:55.699
(sirens blaring)

33:57.094 --> 33:59.352
- Hey. He's still
in the library?

33:59.371 --> 34:02.188
- Yeah. But he hasn't
reached out, made any demands.

34:02.207 --> 34:03.948
- Does he know she's safe?
- He does.

34:04.025 --> 34:05.542
It doesn't seem to matter.

34:05.693 --> 34:08.119
- Alright, Nik,
let's put a vest on her.

34:08.196 --> 34:09.921
If we can't talk him down,
maybe she can.

34:10.774 --> 34:12.198
- You said you'd help her.

34:12.217 --> 34:15.110
- You need to listen to me.
- That was a promise you made.

34:15.128 --> 34:17.946
- Everything that happened
was a misunderstanding.

34:17.964 --> 34:19.539
- I trusted you.

34:19.616 --> 34:21.391
You abducted my daughter.
- No.

34:21.543 --> 34:23.285
- You put her
in the trunk of a car.

34:23.287 --> 34:25.787
- That I can explain--
- The trunk of a damn car!

34:25.789 --> 34:27.880
- Paul. Ah!
(gunshot)

34:27.958 --> 34:29.157
(grunting)

34:29.159 --> 34:30.883
- Paul, talk to me, Paul.

34:30.961 --> 34:33.320
- Daddy? Daddy, I'm okay.

34:34.481 --> 34:35.647
- I saw the video.

34:35.723 --> 34:38.466
My child in that trunk,
screaming for help.

34:39.136 --> 34:40.985
Lemme hear you scream.
- I'm sorry.

34:41.062 --> 34:42.804
- Oh, you can do
better than that.

34:42.823 --> 34:43.822
(gunshot)
- Ahh!

34:43.898 --> 34:44.748
- Daddy!

34:44.899 --> 34:46.566
(groaning)

34:46.585 --> 34:47.501
- Hey.

34:48.662 --> 34:49.661
(breathing heavily)

34:49.737 --> 34:50.645
- Zoey, I'm sorry...

34:50.664 --> 34:52.330
- Daddy, let me in.

34:52.407 --> 34:53.090
- Zoey, I'm your father.

34:53.317 --> 34:54.740
I'm supposed to protect you...

34:54.760 --> 34:55.759
- Daddy, please.

34:55.836 --> 34:57.469
- I introduced you to him.

34:58.505 --> 35:00.338
I pushed you on him.
I pressured you.

35:00.415 --> 35:04.159
I saw his money and power
and what it could do for you.

35:04.161 --> 35:05.343
When I should've seen
everything else.

35:05.420 --> 35:08.087
- You and Zoey can talk
about all that, okay?

35:08.165 --> 35:09.998
You have nothing
but time to talk,

35:10.016 --> 35:12.758
if you open this door.

35:12.836 --> 35:15.112
If you don't,
and that man dies,

35:15.263 --> 35:17.839
then you and your daughter
will have nothing.

35:17.858 --> 35:18.782
(grunting)

35:18.933 --> 35:20.024
(Jason): Paul, let us in.

35:20.177 --> 35:21.192
- We have no time at all,

35:21.345 --> 35:24.454
so will you please
open this door, Paul?

35:25.699 --> 35:28.291
(Jason): Come on, Paul.
We can talk about it.

35:29.461 --> 35:30.585
- Paul?

35:34.115 --> 35:35.373
- Where's the gun?
- On the mantel.

35:35.525 --> 35:38.284
(Jason): Over there. Don't move.

35:38.303 --> 35:39.553
- Daddy.

35:40.622 --> 35:42.389
- Oh.

35:43.458 --> 35:44.549
- Zoey!

35:44.701 --> 35:46.217
(crying)

35:46.294 --> 35:48.961
- I want you to take
a good look around, huh?

35:48.981 --> 35:51.222
You'll never be in a room
this nice again.

35:51.375 --> 35:53.892
'Cause you are under arrest.

35:53.968 --> 35:55.210
- I'll have you wait outside.

35:55.212 --> 35:57.637
- For kidnapping...
- They're gonna be okay.

35:57.656 --> 36:00.064
- ...assault, attempted rape.

36:01.234 --> 36:04.119
And I get a feeling
that's just the starter menu.

36:06.665 --> 36:07.831
- You ready?

36:07.982 --> 36:09.240
- What happens next?
- Well...

36:09.393 --> 36:10.333
You shot a guy.

36:10.727 --> 36:12.669
So the DA is probably gonna
want to press charges,

36:12.896 --> 36:16.064
but I'll do my best to try
to convince them not to.

36:16.066 --> 36:17.674
- Why would you do that?

36:17.825 --> 36:19.417
- I think 'cause I understand.

36:20.328 --> 36:21.419
- Do the nightmares
ever go away?

36:21.571 --> 36:23.254
About him being taken
in the first place.

36:23.407 --> 36:27.091
- No. I mean, not for me.
They don't.

36:27.168 --> 36:29.019
- Because you're a good dad.

36:29.855 --> 36:32.096
And good dads stand watch.
And...

36:33.083 --> 36:36.751
Bad things aren't supposed
to happen when we do.

36:36.753 --> 36:38.361
(sighs)

36:41.033 --> 36:43.325
I feel like I'm in the dark.

36:45.204 --> 36:47.946
Like I'm lost
and I can't find my way.

36:48.022 --> 36:49.948
- Well, like I said,
maybe I can help you.

36:50.100 --> 36:52.375
Maybe we can help each other.
Alright?

36:52.860 --> 36:54.294
- Yeah.

37:01.611 --> 37:02.886
- Hey.

37:02.888 --> 37:06.139
I got a few people here
who'd really like to see you.

37:07.726 --> 37:09.184
- Sarah!

37:10.787 --> 37:13.230
(crying)

37:19.738 --> 37:21.479
- Hey.

37:21.556 --> 37:24.890
News of Baby's Breath's arrest
has other women coming forward.

37:24.910 --> 37:27.577
About him and his enabler.

37:31.324 --> 37:34.309
- You know, the responsibility
that Zoey's dad feels,

37:34.311 --> 37:36.494
I feel it too.
- I know you do.

37:36.571 --> 37:38.980
And I know that's why
you're pushing Keith so hard.

37:38.999 --> 37:41.816
- I know... And I know
that I shouldn't.

37:41.909 --> 37:43.985
Okay? And I know that

37:44.004 --> 37:46.321
he needs space, he needs time.

37:46.932 --> 37:48.323
But I wasn't there
when he was taken

37:48.341 --> 37:50.934
so I feel like I have
to make up for that somehow.

37:51.011 --> 37:53.995
Right, for...
not standing watch.

37:54.422 --> 37:56.564
- You know, the alarm
wasn't on that night.

37:57.809 --> 37:59.350
I turned it on
every single night

37:59.427 --> 38:01.503
except for the one
night that mattered.

38:02.022 --> 38:05.023
So neither of us did enough.

38:05.692 --> 38:08.843
But we both did
everything we could. Right?

38:08.862 --> 38:11.496
- You're right. You're right.

38:19.447 --> 38:21.631
(soft music)

38:30.475 --> 38:32.183
(sighs)

38:53.406 --> 38:54.622
(chuckles)

38:56.576 --> 39:01.171
- Pam texted me the results
of Keith's placement test. Look.

39:04.325 --> 39:05.842
- I mean, that can't...
That can't be right.

39:05.993 --> 39:08.011
- No, it can't.

39:08.162 --> 39:10.138
Not if it's really Keith.

39:11.074 --> 39:12.740
(knocking on door)

39:12.759 --> 39:14.142
- Sid?

39:15.637 --> 39:16.728
Sidney?

39:29.517 --> 39:30.516
- Hey.

39:30.535 --> 39:32.443
- I'm sorry.

39:32.520 --> 39:33.495
I'm sorry, I...

39:34.689 --> 39:35.763
- What do you want?

39:35.765 --> 39:37.207
- I just, uh...

39:38.284 --> 39:41.461
I know you're having
a tough time with this.

39:43.607 --> 39:44.631
With me.

39:46.793 --> 39:49.094
So I just wanted
to say I'm sorry.

39:51.056 --> 39:53.114
- That grade on that paper?

39:53.116 --> 39:54.616
I got it for writing
that Grendel didn't do

39:54.618 --> 39:57.619
monstrous things because
he was exiled and cursed by God.

39:58.212 --> 39:59.879
He was exiled and cursed by God

39:59.898 --> 40:01.564
because of the monstrous
things he did.

40:03.977 --> 40:05.627
- Trying to destroy a family.

40:06.387 --> 40:07.979
- You may be able to fool
everyone else,

40:08.073 --> 40:09.964
but you can't fool me.

40:10.057 --> 40:12.200
- Sid. Please.

40:12.894 --> 40:13.893
I'm your brother.

40:13.987 --> 40:16.162
- My brother is dead.

40:18.733 --> 40:20.417
(sighing)

40:20.568 --> 40:21.643
- Hey, baby.

40:21.645 --> 40:22.919
- Hey, Mom.

40:22.996 --> 40:26.814
- Hey. We got your test
results back.

40:26.816 --> 40:28.925
You're gonna skip a grade.

40:29.594 --> 40:31.836
- Uh, there were books
in my room.

40:31.913 --> 40:33.746
That's pretty much
all there was.

40:34.266 --> 40:36.558
- Are you hungry?
What can I get you?

40:37.827 --> 40:38.885
- Surprise me.

40:39.846 --> 40:41.604
- Alright...
I'm gonna get changed

40:41.714 --> 40:43.514
and I'll be right down. Okay?

40:44.091 --> 40:45.333
You know, it's funny.

40:45.335 --> 40:47.944
When you were little,
you hated surprises.

40:48.171 --> 40:49.520
Now you're full of them.

40:49.673 --> 40:51.656
(chuckling)

40:56.455 --> 40:59.289
(tense music)

41:27.486 --> 41:30.570
(hammering)

41:40.724 --> 41:43.333
(hammering)

42:08.601 --> 42:10.276
I can explain.

42:11.755 --> 42:14.030
- Thank you for believing me.

42:20.764 --> 42:22.872
(♪♪)

42:23.024 --> 42:26.376
Subtitling: difuze
