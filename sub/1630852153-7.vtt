I would be

06:39.934 --> 06:42.433

06:42.567 --> 06:44.500
Brunswick, the company
that makes these products,

06:44.633 --> 06:47.033
they're discontinuing these
frames because the

06:47.166 --> 06:50.400
metal they use is too
expensive for the product.

06:50.533 --> 06:52.867
So, there's been a little bit
of a frenzy trying to,

06:53.000 --> 06:54.934
like, secure these things.
- Right.

06:55.066 --> 06:57.500
There's one major motor
that's pretty expensive.

06:57.633 --> 06:58.734
They're just 4 bolts.

06:58.867 --> 07:01.200
They're worth 5 or 600,

07:01.333 --> 07:04.600
- What is the used market?
- 250 to 4.

07:04.734 --> 07:06.000
- Hundred?
- Yeah.

07:06.133 --> 07:08.533
Okay, 'cause in scrap
they're probably 40 bucks.

07:08.667 --> 07:09.800
- Yeah.
- Worth saving.

07:09.934 --> 07:11.800
- Oh, absolutely.
- You want to buy 'em all?

07:11.934 --> 07:13.233
I would probably
take half of them.

07:13.367 --> 07:14.934
Alright,
sounds good to me.

07:15.066 --> 07:18.567
Tyler's keen on the pinsetter
frames and motors.

07:18.700 --> 07:19.867
If he takes 'em out himself,

07:20.000 --> 07:22.300
I'll let him have 'em
for 300 per lane.

07:22.433 --> 07:25.667
At 16 lanes,
that's 4800 bucks.

07:25.800 --> 07:27.934
Leaving Tyler to it,
Ted heads off

07:28.066 --> 07:31.200

his go-to guy for wood.

07:31.333 --> 07:32.800
So, what do you think?

07:32.934 --> 07:34.300
Well, Ted, it looks
pretty good to me.

07:34.433 --> 07:35.734
- Nice, isn't it?
- Yeah.

07:35.867 --> 07:37.600
I knew it'd be
up your alley. Ha!

07:37.734 --> 07:39.033

07:39.166 --> 07:41.400

7 years ago.

07:41.533 --> 07:43.433

Does beautiful work.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.266
I reckon this is all
southern yellow pine.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.033
This would've
come from Texas,

07:56.166 --> 07:58.500
Georgia, Florida,
the Carolinas.

07:58.633 --> 08:01.467
And it's funny that on the
outside they've used some maple.

08:01.600 --> 08:03.033
- Really, eh?
- Just the outside strips.

08:03.166 --> 08:04.500
Why is that?

08:04.633 --> 08:07.900
I think it's because the maple
is much harder and denser,

08:08.033 --> 08:09.967
so if the balls
are going into the gutter,

08:10.100 --> 08:13.767
it won't fall apart like maybe
the southern yellow pine could.

08:13.900 --> 08:17.266
I am glad Niko's here.
He is the wood whisperer.

08:17.400 --> 08:19.133
So, what are you thinking?

08:19.266 --> 08:21.500
Okay, we've got
16 lanes here.

08:21.633 --> 08:23.934
- About 70 feet per lane.
- Right.

08:24.066 --> 08:26.700

- How wide is that?

08:29.900 --> 08:31.300
- That's like...?
- They're 42-inches wide.

08:31.433 --> 08:35.600
So, you got 42-inches...
it's 550 board feet.

08:35.734 --> 08:37.033
- Per lane?
- Per lane.

08:37.166 --> 08:38.367
I like that.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.266
This is wood talk.
This is how it's sold.

08:40.400 --> 08:42.734
Reclaimed lumber is
sold in board feet.

08:42.867 --> 08:46.033
12 inches by 12 inches
by 1 inch thick.

08:46.166 --> 08:47.934
The potential for
profit here is good.

08:48.066 --> 08:50.433
The timeframe is not.

08:50.567 --> 08:52.967
We have two days till the
machines hit this place.

- Hahaha. Okay.
- I'm serious.

08:55.333 --> 08:57.200
- We gotta move fast.
- We'll make it happen.

08:57.333 --> 09:00.834
Price-wise, I think we'll wait
to see what you can get out.

09:00.967 --> 09:02.934
You know I'm fair.
I'm gonna be fair.

09:03.066 --> 09:05.033
Like, 50 bucks a
board foot or something?

09:05.166 --> 09:07.266
I'll bring the briefcase
full of cash next time I see ya.

09:07.400 --> 09:09.000
- (laughs)
- There you go.

09:09.133 --> 09:10.266
You're the best, man.
Thank you so much.

09:10.400 --> 09:12.967
Now let's figure out how
we're getting this out 'a here.

09:13.100 --> 09:14.300
So, like, it's seized?

09:14.433 --> 09:17.266
Back downstairs, Tyler's
brought in his mechanic, Joe,

09:17.400 --> 09:19.500
to help remove
the pinsetter parts.

09:19.633 --> 09:21.133
The gear boxes
are so old that

09:21.266 --> 09:22.667
there's a lot of
rust on this thing.

09:22.800 --> 09:24.767
It's not turning at all,
any which way.

09:24.900 --> 09:26.266
So, we're gonna
remove this then.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.500
- You got it?
- Ready?

09:27.633 --> 09:28.834
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

being 50 years old,

09:34.934 --> 09:37.233
did not come out nearly as
smoothly as we were hoping.
