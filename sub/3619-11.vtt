00:03.307 --> 00:05.527
LEO:
I don't know
what more proof you need.

00:05.701 --> 00:07.224
You told me yourself
it sounds great.

00:07.398 --> 00:08.399
It does.

00:08.573 --> 00:10.271
So what's the problem?

00:10.445 --> 00:11.663
Burning toast.

00:11.837 --> 00:13.274
What?

00:13.448 --> 00:14.492
The toast,
it's burning.[toaster pops up]

00:14.666 --> 00:15.928
Oh.

00:16.103 --> 00:17.800
[sizzling]

00:17.974 --> 00:19.628
Now see,
there's a question.

00:19.802 --> 00:20.977
Your Avatar friends
are promising

00:21.151 --> 00:22.631
this big, bright future.

00:22.805 --> 00:24.850
Um... will there be
burning toast?

00:25.025 --> 00:26.330
Piper, be serious.

00:26.504 --> 00:27.462
I am.

00:27.636 --> 00:29.290
You know, they
say they're

00:29.464 --> 00:32.597
going to rid the world of evil,
bring about a better way.

00:32.771 --> 00:34.686
What else are they going
to get rid of?

00:34.860 --> 00:35.992
Nothing else.

00:36.166 --> 00:37.385
We had this conversation.

00:37.559 --> 00:39.169
Yeah, I know, but...You talked to

00:39.343 --> 00:41.171
the other Avatars, they answered
all your questions.

00:41.345 --> 00:42.477
Still, I...

00:42.651 --> 00:44.218
What more do you need to know?

00:44.392 --> 00:46.742
Well, if you'd let me finish
a damn sentence, I'd tell ya.

00:46.916 --> 00:48.787
Look,

00:48.961 --> 00:51.399
the more I think about the whole
thing, the more it worries me.

00:51.573 --> 00:52.574
No...

00:52.748 --> 00:53.966
save the pitch, I've heard it.

00:54.141 --> 00:55.707
And I'm not saying it doesn't

00:55.881 --> 00:58.362
sound great, because
obviously it does,
especially after

00:58.536 --> 00:59.450
everything
we've been through, but...

00:59.624 --> 01:00.669
But?

01:00.843 --> 01:02.279
But it's a huge decision.

01:02.453 --> 01:04.107
I mean, it's one thing
to save the world

01:04.281 --> 01:06.414
from evil every week.

01:06.588 --> 01:08.329
It's another thing entirely
to change the world

01:08.503 --> 01:09.634
just because we can.

01:09.808 --> 01:11.158
I mean,
isn't that a little cocky?

01:11.332 --> 01:14.378
No. In this case,
it's a leap of faith.

01:14.552 --> 01:16.032
One that I'm willing
to fight for

01:16.206 --> 01:18.121
because I have faith
in the Avatars.

01:18.295 --> 01:21.603
Yeah, but not everyone else has
reached your level of faith yet.

01:21.777 --> 01:23.561
[door creaking]

01:23.735 --> 01:25.607
Is that the front door?

01:25.781 --> 01:28.044
Phoebe?

01:28.218 --> 01:30.090
Paige?

01:31.830 --> 01:33.876
That's odd.
Did you leave that open?

01:34.050 --> 01:35.791
No, I orbed in.

01:37.358 --> 01:38.315
Son of a bitch.

01:42.667 --> 01:45.105
[whooshing]

01:45.279 --> 01:46.497
That was close.

01:46.671 --> 01:47.672
[whooshing]

01:47.846 --> 01:49.457
ALPHA:
Too close.

01:49.631 --> 01:52.286
That's the second time
he's tried to kill you, Leo.

01:52.460 --> 01:55.289
We need to do something
about this.

01:55.463 --> 01:57.943
All right, well, I'm not
gonna do anything until
you unfreeze Piper.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.468
I can't keep lying to her.

02:00.642 --> 02:01.643
[whooshing]

02:01.817 --> 02:03.601
Watch out...

02:04.863 --> 02:06.474
What are they doing here?

02:06.648 --> 02:07.953
Saving his life.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.955
This vial contains
an ancient potion

02:10.130 --> 02:12.219
that kills Avatars,
Piper.

02:12.393 --> 02:14.699
Which means that someone
must have told Agent Brody

02:14.873 --> 02:16.353
that Leo is one of us now.

02:16.527 --> 02:18.138
Paige.

02:18.312 --> 02:20.009
All right,
what do you want from me?

02:20.183 --> 02:21.184
I'll kill her later.

02:21.358 --> 02:22.446
ALPHA:
Make no mistake, Piper.

02:22.620 --> 02:23.969
This is a serious matter.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.363
One that demands
our immediate attention.

02:26.537 --> 02:29.845
If even one of us were to
die, it could weaken the
collective to the point

02:30.019 --> 02:32.064
where we might not be able
to implement the change.

02:32.239 --> 02:33.501
PIPER:
You know, well,

02:33.675 --> 02:35.024
maybe you guys should have
thought of that

02:35.198 --> 02:36.460
before you killed
Brody's parents.

02:36.634 --> 02:37.592
Piper.

02:37.766 --> 02:38.984
What?

02:39.159 --> 02:40.725
That's why he views them
as a threat,

02:40.899 --> 02:42.074
that's what he
thinks happened.

02:42.249 --> 02:45.948
Do you... view us
as a threat, Piper?

02:46.122 --> 02:48.646
You know, actually I'm still
working on that one, thanks.

02:48.820 --> 02:50.257
We didn't kill his parents,
Piper.

02:50.431 --> 02:51.910
That's not what we're about.

02:52.084 --> 02:54.086
She'll discover what
we're about in her own time,

02:54.261 --> 02:56.219
as Phoebe already has.

02:56.393 --> 02:59.483
But we are running
out of time.

02:59.657 --> 03:02.269
Agent Brody is not the only
problem that we face.

03:02.443 --> 03:04.967
Even as we speak,
the demon Zankou

03:05.141 --> 03:08.971
is mobilizing the underworld
to try and stop us, as well.

03:15.456 --> 03:19.677
If you truly desire a life
beyond good and evil, Piper...

03:21.201 --> 03:22.898
...we're going
to need your help.

03:23.072 --> 03:25.117
Which means...

03:25.292 --> 03:27.207
you'll need
to decide quickly.

03:29.905 --> 03:31.080
[whooshing]

03:31.254 --> 03:32.386
What happened?

03:32.560 --> 03:33.343
Huh?

03:33.517 --> 03:34.562
What did you do?

03:34.736 --> 03:36.433
Kyle, wait, listen to me.

03:36.607 --> 03:37.521
BRODY:
No, you don't understand.

03:37.695 --> 03:39.784
That was the last potion.

03:39.958 --> 03:42.222
You have no idea
what you just did.

03:44.746 --> 03:47.052
Okay, so you see why I'm having
a little problem

03:47.227 --> 03:48.619
with the faith thing, right?

03:48.793 --> 03:50.404
Paige!

03:52.580 --> 03:54.016
What? What's going on?

03:54.190 --> 03:55.800
Oh, you know, nothing.

to kill my husband.

05:12.224 --> 05:13.574
I don't know
what happened.

05:13.748 --> 05:15.227
I told Kyle you were
an Avatar at breakfast.

05:15.402 --> 05:16.533
He seemed okay with it.

05:16.707 --> 05:18.100
Yeah, well,
you should have warned us

05:18.274 --> 05:19.275
you were gonna
tell him.

05:19.449 --> 05:20.842
I would have

05:21.016 --> 05:22.844
if I would have known
what he was going to do.

05:23.018 --> 05:24.889
Not that I can blame him.

05:25.063 --> 05:26.717
Excuse me?

05:26.891 --> 05:28.763
I mean, not the whole killing
you thing, obviously.

05:28.937 --> 05:32.506
But... his parents were killed
by the Avatars.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.725
The Avatars weren't
responsible for that.

05:34.899 --> 05:37.032
How do you know?
Were you there, Leo?

05:37.206 --> 05:38.773
No, I wasn't,
but now that I'm an Avatar,

05:38.947 --> 05:40.470
I can tell you,
they wouldn't do that

05:40.644 --> 05:42.298
because it goes against
everything they believe in.

05:42.472 --> 05:44.256
Well, Kyle thinks otherwise,
and he happened to be there.

05:44.431 --> 05:45.606
PIPER:
Paige, in all
fairness,

05:45.780 --> 05:47.129
he was only five years old.

05:47.303 --> 05:49.566
I mean, who knows
what really happened?

05:49.740 --> 05:51.307
Why don't you try
to convince him of that?

05:52.743 --> 05:53.918
Talking about Kyle, I assume?

05:54.092 --> 05:55.485
I just called him,
looking for you.

05:55.659 --> 05:56.747
He gave me an earful.

05:56.921 --> 05:58.314
You okay?

05:58.488 --> 05:59.794
Yeah.

05:59.968 --> 06:01.709
It's a good thing
Kyle is out of potions.

06:01.883 --> 06:04.233
PHOEBE:
It still doesn't
solve his problem.

06:04.407 --> 06:06.453
And until somebody does,

06:06.627 --> 06:09.369
I would assume that you're
not going to go along

06:09.543 --> 06:10.587
with the Avatars,
right?

06:10.761 --> 06:12.328
What do you have
up your sleeve?

06:12.502 --> 06:13.764
Well, I was
just thinking.

06:13.938 --> 06:15.853
Remember how Leo sent you back

06:16.027 --> 06:18.378
to find out what really happened
to your parents?

06:18.552 --> 06:20.467
Yeah.
Well...

06:20.641 --> 06:22.382
maybe we could do
the same thing for Kyle

06:22.556 --> 06:23.948
and help him move on.

06:24.122 --> 06:26.386
Okay, but what if Kyle sees

06:26.560 --> 06:28.388
that they really did
kill his parents?

06:28.562 --> 06:32.435
Well, if that's the case,
then we'll kill the Avatars

06:32.609 --> 06:34.045
and help him
move on that way.

06:34.219 --> 06:35.786
The sooner we help Kyle

06:35.960 --> 06:38.354
find out the truth,
the sooner we can all move on.

06:38.528 --> 06:39.703
Move on to what?

06:39.877 --> 06:42.053
The future the Avatars
promised us.

06:42.227 --> 06:43.446
The one I saw
in my vision.

06:43.620 --> 06:45.753
Okay, but, Phoebe,
we all didn't see that.

06:45.927 --> 06:50.235
Yes, but you could
if you and I swap powers.

06:50.410 --> 06:51.498
What?!

06:51.672 --> 06:53.195
It would just be
for a little while,

06:53.369 --> 06:54.762
just long enough for you
to see the vision for yourself.

06:54.936 --> 06:56.590
I promise you,
it's beautiful.

06:57.634 --> 07:01.290
Okay, look, if the Avatars
are exonerated,

07:01.464 --> 07:05.250
and I see what Phoebe saw,
then we'll talk about it.

07:07.296 --> 07:10.430
Fine, I'll talk, too.

07:16.784 --> 07:18.133
Zankou.

07:18.307 --> 07:20.614
Hi. Sorry to disturb you.

07:20.788 --> 07:22.790
What is it?
Uh...

07:22.964 --> 07:24.313
well, we were just wondering--

07:24.487 --> 07:26.184
and I mean all of us,
not just myself--

07:26.358 --> 07:29.100
when things were going
to move along.

07:29.274 --> 07:31.625
You know, seeing as how
the Avatars are so close

07:31.799 --> 07:33.931
to wiping us off the face
of the earth and all.

07:34.105 --> 07:35.759
The Avatars
are not the problem.

07:35.933 --> 07:37.326
Not the problem?

07:37.500 --> 07:39.197
Well, we unleashed you
to save us from them

07:39.371 --> 07:41.112
and now they're not the prob...?

07:41.286 --> 07:42.592
I'm a little confused.

07:43.724 --> 07:45.508
Would you like me to elaborate?

07:45.682 --> 07:46.901
Yes, please.

07:48.119 --> 07:49.904
[grunts]

07:50.078 --> 07:52.167
[groans]

07:52.341 --> 07:54.038
We can't stop the Avatars.

07:54.212 --> 07:56.563
But we might be able
to stop the Charmed Ones

07:56.737 --> 07:58.129
before they join forces
with them.

07:58.303 --> 08:00.436
If we can do that,

08:00.610 --> 08:03.483
then the Avatars won't have
the power they need

08:03.657 --> 08:08.139
in order to remake the world
and eliminate us.

08:08.313 --> 08:10.577
Destroying the Charmed Ones.

08:10.751 --> 08:12.056
It always sounds easy.

08:12.230 --> 08:13.580
Many have tried.

08:13.754 --> 08:15.233
No one succeeded.

08:15.407 --> 08:17.105
There's a first time
for everything.

08:18.410 --> 08:19.629
Besides, I never had
the opportunity

08:19.803 --> 08:22.589
to go up against them before.

08:23.633 --> 08:24.982
I sense...

08:25.156 --> 08:28.116
the chance is near.

08:31.380 --> 08:33.991
PAIGE:
Are you trying
to get yourself killed,

08:34.165 --> 08:35.863
'cause you know that's what
easily could have happened.

08:36.037 --> 08:37.691
Yeah, well,
it was a chance I had to take.

08:37.865 --> 08:39.954
You kill one Avatar, it weakens
them all, they're connected.

08:40.128 --> 08:41.825
Kyle, you tried
to kill Leo.

08:41.999 --> 08:43.218
I don't care.

08:43.392 --> 08:44.872
I do, and if you actually
cared about me,

08:45.046 --> 08:46.264
maybe you would, too.

08:46.438 --> 08:47.701
No, no, see,
don't lay that on me.

08:47.875 --> 08:49.354
Don't lay what on you?

08:49.529 --> 08:51.748
He's my brother-in-law,
he matters to me.

08:51.922 --> 08:54.272
Yeah, my parents
mattered to me, too.

08:54.446 --> 08:57.493
[inhales]
Okay.

08:57.667 --> 08:59.930
Even if the Avatars didkill
them, Leo wasn't there.

09:00.104 --> 09:00.931
How can you even

09:01.105 --> 09:02.454
hold him responsible?

09:02.629 --> 09:04.108
It was the only way
I could get to them.

09:04.282 --> 09:06.458
So you would kill somebody
who's innocent

09:06.633 --> 09:08.896
to exact revenge on whoever
killed your parents?

09:09.070 --> 09:11.812
Gee, that makes you
a whole lot better

09:11.986 --> 09:13.204
than those killers.

09:13.378 --> 09:15.119
Look, I know
who killed my parents.

09:15.293 --> 09:16.686
Do you? You sure?Yeah, I'm sure.

09:16.860 --> 09:18.209
Then you won't mind
proving it, right?

09:18.383 --> 09:20.124
What are you talking about?I'm talking about

09:20.298 --> 09:23.084
getting you past this, finding
out who... who really did this.

09:25.042 --> 09:26.783
Are you interested?

09:29.307 --> 09:30.395
Yeah.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.354
Good.

09:32.528 --> 09:35.183
Then you won't mind going on
a little trip with me.

09:37.794 --> 09:40.275
I know the power-switching spell
is in here somewhere.

09:40.449 --> 09:41.798
We've used it before.

09:41.972 --> 09:43.757
Yeah, and if
I remember correctly,

09:43.931 --> 09:45.933
didn't it bite us
in the ass?

09:46.107 --> 09:47.412
I'm just saying.

09:49.110 --> 09:50.764
All right,
as long as Kyle is willing,

09:50.938 --> 09:52.983
the Avatars said they would
send him back to the past.

09:53.157 --> 09:55.159
They've got
the easy part.

09:55.333 --> 09:57.640
They should try
dealing with a stubborn
sister in the present.

09:57.814 --> 10:00.077
So I'm having
second thoughts, sue me.

10:00.251 --> 10:01.992
I'm telling you, it's
well worth the risk

10:02.166 --> 10:03.777
for you to see
what I saw.

10:03.951 --> 10:06.344
Imagine a future with
no demons, a future where

10:06.518 --> 10:07.781
we're all free,

10:07.955 --> 10:10.044
where our kids
get to grow up happy

10:10.218 --> 10:12.089
and have normal lives?

10:12.263 --> 10:13.830
I mean, it's what
we've always dreamed of.

10:14.004 --> 10:15.310
Piper, it's what
you've always dreamed of.

10:15.484 --> 10:17.921
And you got all that
from one vision?

10:18.095 --> 10:19.749
Actually, I did.

10:19.923 --> 10:22.883
What are you
smiling at?

10:23.057 --> 10:25.233
Nothing.

10:25.407 --> 10:27.278
[sighs]

10:28.410 --> 10:29.193
PAIGE:
Okay,

10:29.367 --> 10:30.891
we're ready.

10:31.065 --> 10:32.370
Good, I'm glad.

10:32.544 --> 10:33.415
And you will be, too.

10:33.589 --> 10:35.591
We'll see.

10:35.765 --> 10:37.854
All right, well, let me explain
how this is gonna work.

10:38.028 --> 10:39.116
BRODY:
Hold it.

10:39.290 --> 10:40.857
He's doing this?PIPER:
Uh, yeah.

10:41.031 --> 10:42.642
Is there a problem?Yeah.

10:42.816 --> 10:44.121
How do I know
he and the other Avatars

10:44.295 --> 10:45.514
aren't gonna change the past?

10:45.688 --> 10:47.211
Make it look
like they want it to?

10:47.385 --> 10:49.649
We can't change your past,
nor would we want to.

10:49.823 --> 10:51.215
Besides, you'll know
if it's been messed with.

10:51.389 --> 10:52.782
It's your past.

10:52.956 --> 10:54.349
And I got the word
of an Avatar on this?

10:54.523 --> 10:55.393
No way.

10:55.567 --> 10:56.656
PAIGE:
Kyle...

10:56.830 --> 10:58.092
please. We have
to do this.

10:58.266 --> 11:00.137
It's the only way
we're ever going to

11:00.311 --> 11:03.097
find out the
truth, right?

11:05.186 --> 11:07.405
All right.

11:07.579 --> 11:08.580
What do I do?

11:09.581 --> 11:11.279
Close your eyes.

11:12.323 --> 11:13.585
Concentrate on the day.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.239
See it.

11:17.285 --> 11:18.460
How do we get back?

11:18.634 --> 11:20.505
You'll get back
when he finds the truth.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.072
Of course.

11:23.726 --> 11:25.597
[whooshing]

11:39.176 --> 11:40.569
Now what?

11:42.092 --> 11:43.441
Now we work on you.

11:52.755 --> 11:55.453
You okay?Ugh, yeah.

11:55.627 --> 11:57.978
Still not used
to this time travel stuff.

12:01.198 --> 12:02.460
Oh, my God.

12:08.292 --> 12:11.948
SANTA:
Merry Christmas,
Merry Christmas.

12:12.122 --> 12:14.124
Wait a minute,
something's not right.

12:14.298 --> 12:16.648
What, what's not right?

12:16.823 --> 12:18.259
[horn honking]Come on!

12:18.433 --> 12:20.304
MAN:
Hey, buddy,
watch it, huh.

12:20.478 --> 12:21.958
Where are you going?

12:29.226 --> 12:31.272
December 28, 1981.

12:31.446 --> 12:33.100
Isn't that the date?
Yeah.

12:33.274 --> 12:34.928
This, uh, this isn't
where it happened.

12:35.102 --> 12:35.929
This isn't where
they died.

12:36.103 --> 12:38.192
PAIGE:
You sure?

12:38.366 --> 12:39.933
Yeah, of course I'm sure.

12:40.107 --> 12:42.892
They died in a warehouse
near JFK at 7:52 at night.

12:43.066 --> 12:44.198
I checked the
coroner's report.

12:44.372 --> 12:46.156
This... this is
Columbia University.

12:46.330 --> 12:48.463
This is
where they taught.
Maybe we're
starting here

12:48.637 --> 12:51.596
for some other reason.Yeah, because the Avatars
want me to miss seeing it.

12:51.771 --> 12:52.859
That's not going
to happen, Paige.

12:53.033 --> 12:54.164
We got to get
to the airport.

12:54.338 --> 12:55.862
Hey, taxi!

12:56.036 --> 12:57.864
PAIGE:
Cool, Raiders of
the Lost Ark.

12:58.038 --> 12:59.256
I always wanted
to see that.

13:00.823 --> 13:01.737
PAIGE:
Christmas in New York.

13:01.911 --> 13:03.652
Nothing like it, right?

13:03.826 --> 13:05.436
It's the first one
I remember.

13:05.610 --> 13:07.177
What'd you get
for Christmas?

13:07.351 --> 13:08.613
Uh...

13:08.788 --> 13:11.312
a bunch of books,
snow globe, Rubik's cube.

13:11.486 --> 13:13.531
You must have been a
smart boy to handle that.

13:13.705 --> 13:14.619
I like puzzles.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.099
Hey, taxi!

13:21.409 --> 13:22.453
Come on.

13:34.552 --> 13:35.510
CHILD:
Mom.

13:36.554 --> 13:37.773
Mommy.

13:37.947 --> 13:39.644
It's okay, son,
she's all right.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.168
She just fainted.

13:41.342 --> 13:43.039
You want to get
your jacket?

13:44.258 --> 13:45.912
Do you know
who she is?

13:46.086 --> 13:47.827
Yeah.

13:48.001 --> 13:49.306
That's my mom.

13:50.786 --> 13:53.441
Which makes him...

13:53.615 --> 13:54.616
You.

14:06.367 --> 14:07.716
Found it!

14:07.890 --> 14:09.022
You ready?

14:09.196 --> 14:11.459
Uh... what
if Zankou shows up?

14:11.633 --> 14:12.808
W-What are we gonna
do then?

14:12.982 --> 14:13.809
Well, then

14:13.983 --> 14:15.376
I blow him up.

14:15.550 --> 14:16.420
I mean, we're still
gonna have our powers,

14:16.594 --> 14:17.508
just in different bodies.

14:17.682 --> 14:18.727
W-What if that doesn't work?

14:18.901 --> 14:20.120
What if we need Paige, too?

14:20.294 --> 14:22.078
Why are you
procrastinating?

14:22.252 --> 14:23.558
What are you
afraid of?

14:23.732 --> 14:25.081
Honestly... a lot of things,
actually.

14:25.255 --> 14:26.256
I mean, even if

14:26.430 --> 14:27.649
this works,
we're still talking

14:27.823 --> 14:29.564
about remaking the world
as we know it,

14:29.738 --> 14:31.479
and frankly,
that makes me a little nervous.

14:31.653 --> 14:35.265
I promise you you will not be
nervous once you see what I saw.

14:35.439 --> 14:36.919
Trust me.

14:38.790 --> 14:40.923
BOTH:
"What's mine is yours,
what's yours is mine.

14:41.097 --> 14:42.838
"I offer up my gift to share,

14:43.012 --> 14:45.188
switch our powers
through the air."

14:53.022 --> 14:54.154
[yells]

14:57.592 --> 14:59.072
Uh-oh!

15:10.779 --> 15:12.128
Where's the third one?

15:12.302 --> 15:13.260
PHOEBE:
Uh... you know what?

15:13.434 --> 15:14.696
We're not really sure,

15:14.870 --> 15:16.785
so why don't you just
come back later, okay?

15:18.526 --> 15:20.745
Nah.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.878
Ahh!

15:29.624 --> 15:30.538
What happened?

15:30.712 --> 15:31.582
Why didn't you fight back?

15:31.756 --> 15:34.759
Go ahead, tell him.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.326
We sort of
lost our powers.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.163
Maybe we should
try calling for
our powers?

15:47.337 --> 15:48.860
We already tried
that; it didn't work.

15:49.035 --> 15:50.558
All right, well,
maybe we should try again.

15:50.732 --> 15:52.212
Piper,
where are you going?

15:52.386 --> 15:55.345
Well, the powers went out
the window, didn't they?

15:55.519 --> 15:57.217
Yeah, so you expect
to find them laying around

15:57.391 --> 15:59.436
on the front lawn?Don't get smart with me,
mister.

15:59.610 --> 16:01.134
This was not my idea.

16:01.308 --> 16:02.962
I said I was sorry.
I was just trying

16:03.136 --> 16:05.051
to get you to
see what I saw.
Yes, and now

16:05.225 --> 16:06.966
I can see
that we are going to die

16:07.140 --> 16:08.576
and I don't need your powers
for that.

16:08.750 --> 16:09.838
LEO:
Maybe you should

16:10.012 --> 16:10.926
try scrying for them.

16:11.100 --> 16:12.275
Why would that work?

16:12.449 --> 16:13.363
Because they're alive.

16:13.537 --> 16:14.364
They still exist somewhere.

16:14.538 --> 16:15.800
PHOEBE:
Somewhere?

16:15.975 --> 16:17.411
Somewhere where, like in people?

16:17.585 --> 16:19.326
Two very surprised people.

16:19.500 --> 16:23.721
Oh, we gotta get Paige back here
before Zankou attacks again.

16:23.895 --> 16:25.375
We can't; they can only return

16:25.549 --> 16:26.724
after they find out
who killed Kyle's parents.

16:26.898 --> 16:28.422
PHOEBE:
How did he know
to attack us?

16:28.596 --> 16:30.163
I mean, right when we were
about to switch powers.

16:30.337 --> 16:31.686
LEO:
Well, he must have
known somehow.

16:31.860 --> 16:33.122
He must have sensed
you were vulnerable.

16:33.296 --> 16:35.385
Now I know why the Source
locked him up.

16:35.559 --> 16:38.301
You need to take the kids
to Magic School right away.

16:38.475 --> 16:40.912
No way, and leave you alone
without powers?You have to.

16:41.087 --> 16:42.958
There's no other option.
We'll call you if we need you,

16:43.132 --> 16:44.568
but you gotta get them
out of here.

16:47.789 --> 16:49.617
And we need to find our powers.

16:49.791 --> 16:52.011
[crashing in distance]

16:54.274 --> 16:57.059
[clattering][woman screams]

16:57.233 --> 16:59.931
I think I just found mine.

17:00.106 --> 17:03.413
I'm going to find
my powers.[noise continues]

17:03.587 --> 17:07.113
One of them's found
her powers already,

17:07.287 --> 17:09.158
which means the other one
will, as well.

17:09.332 --> 17:11.726
Does that mean
we've missed our chance?

17:11.900 --> 17:13.554
Not necessarily.

17:13.728 --> 17:15.773
With all due respect,
Zankou, you said you knew

17:15.947 --> 17:18.733
when the Charmed Ones would be
at their most vulnerable.

17:18.907 --> 17:19.734
They were vulnerable.

17:19.908 --> 17:21.518
I sensed it.

17:21.692 --> 17:24.956
I just didn't anticipate the
Elder coming to their rescue.

17:25.131 --> 17:26.958
Maybe we should rethink
things a little.

17:27.133 --> 17:28.960
Maybe go after
the Avatars instead.

17:29.135 --> 17:32.921
With their power...
we wouldn't stand a chance.

17:33.095 --> 17:35.402
Some of us think we would.

17:40.755 --> 17:42.800
[screaming]

17:42.974 --> 17:45.238
Now they don't think that.

17:48.545 --> 17:49.981
If you're still going
after the witches, how

17:50.156 --> 17:51.331
do we get past the Elder?

17:51.505 --> 17:53.202
By letting the other Elders know

17:53.376 --> 17:55.378
he's not really
one of them anymore.

17:58.642 --> 18:01.428
SANTA:
Ho, ho, ho...

18:01.602 --> 18:03.038
Merry Christmas.

18:05.345 --> 18:06.737
Thank you.

18:06.911 --> 18:08.609
Is my mom gonna be okay?

18:08.783 --> 18:10.350
She's going
to be fine.

18:10.524 --> 18:12.961
Is there anyone we
can call for you?

18:13.135 --> 18:14.136
A husband maybe?

18:14.310 --> 18:15.311
MAN:
There's no need,

18:15.485 --> 18:16.312
he's right here.

18:16.486 --> 18:17.748
Hey.

18:17.922 --> 18:18.967
Dad.

18:20.186 --> 18:21.622
Dad... uh,

18:21.796 --> 18:23.102
is that your dad?

18:23.276 --> 18:25.060
Careful.
JACK:
Honey, um,
what's wrong?

18:25.234 --> 18:28.107
One of the T.A.s told me
that you were sick?I... no, I'm fine.

18:28.281 --> 18:29.456
I-I had a
fainting spell.

18:29.630 --> 18:30.457
Fainting spell?

18:30.631 --> 18:32.328
I-I was so startled.

18:32.502 --> 18:33.329
He's the spitting image

18:33.503 --> 18:34.809
of my father.

18:34.983 --> 18:36.202
Crazy coincidences,

18:36.376 --> 18:38.160
right?

18:38.334 --> 18:39.335
Well, uh, either way, uh,

18:39.509 --> 18:40.771
thanks a lot
for helping her out.

18:40.945 --> 18:42.469
I'm Jack, Jack Brody.

18:42.643 --> 18:46.342
This is Kevin... Kevin
Matthews, and I am Paige,

18:46.516 --> 18:47.735
and we're late
for a movie.

18:47.909 --> 18:49.954
Oh, what are you guys
gonna go see?

18:50.129 --> 18:51.869
Uh...
Raiders of
the Lost Ark.

18:52.043 --> 18:54.045
Cool, can I go with?

18:54.220 --> 18:55.569
No, you can't go with.

18:55.743 --> 18:57.440
You're too little.

18:57.614 --> 19:00.878
Trust me, though,
you're gonna love it.

19:01.052 --> 19:02.010
[phone rings]

19:02.184 --> 19:03.664
Oh, uh, just give me one second.

19:03.838 --> 19:05.622
You get this
for Christmas?

19:05.796 --> 19:06.884
Yep.Hello.

19:07.058 --> 19:08.277
RUTH:
He loves reading about

19:08.451 --> 19:09.626
all the Egyptian kings
and queens.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.150
What's your favorite story,
Kyle?

19:11.324 --> 19:13.108
BOTH:
The Mummy's Curse.

19:14.283 --> 19:15.110
[young Kyle mutters
indistinctly]

19:15.284 --> 19:16.459
Yeah...

19:17.808 --> 19:20.246
I'm sure it's every
kid's favorite story.

19:20.420 --> 19:22.465
My folks used to read
it to me all the time.

19:22.639 --> 19:24.293
Well, you have good parents.

19:24.467 --> 19:26.643
Yeah.

19:26.817 --> 19:30.256
All right then, uh, Kevin,
we really should be going.

19:30.430 --> 19:32.301
We should, too.
That was customs.

19:32.475 --> 19:34.651
The manifest for the
Cairo shipment is missing.

19:34.825 --> 19:36.000
They're telling us that

19:36.175 --> 19:37.611
they're gonna destroy
the whole shipment

19:37.785 --> 19:39.178
unless we get down there
and identify it.

19:39.352 --> 19:40.266
RUTH:
They're priceless
artifacts.

19:40.440 --> 19:41.441
They can't just
destroy them.

19:41.615 --> 19:42.398
JACK:
Well, apparently they can

19:42.572 --> 19:43.834
and they will.

19:44.008 --> 19:45.488
So, sorry to have
to cut this short.

19:47.316 --> 19:48.578
I hope we see you
again soon.

19:48.752 --> 19:50.232
Yeah, yeah, me, too.

19:51.929 --> 19:53.670
Okay, then.
Bye, all.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.636
What are you thinking?

20:02.810 --> 20:04.594
I'm sorry, all
right, I just...

20:04.768 --> 20:06.509
thought it'd be
easier than this.

20:06.683 --> 20:08.250
You have to be careful.

20:08.424 --> 20:11.122
You can't risk
changing the past.

20:11.297 --> 20:12.776
Look, you yourself said
that there's a reason

20:12.950 --> 20:14.082
why I came here first.

20:14.256 --> 20:15.953
That's not the reason.

20:16.127 --> 20:18.956
We came to see who killed them,
not to save them.

20:19.130 --> 20:21.002
Look, all my life, I-I
just used to think that...

20:21.176 --> 20:23.309
if I could just talk to my
parents one more time--

20:23.483 --> 20:24.919
five minutes, even--
that would be enough.

20:25.093 --> 20:26.877
I don't know.

20:27.051 --> 20:29.445
I don't think I can just sit
back and watch my parents die.

20:29.619 --> 20:31.404
You don't have a choice.

20:33.449 --> 20:35.364
We can't change the past.

20:41.196 --> 20:43.242
CONDUCTOR:
Next stop: Venice.

20:44.939 --> 20:45.809
Oh, no, honey.

20:45.983 --> 20:47.071
No, don't. I...

20:47.246 --> 20:48.595
Look, baby,
you gotta believe me.

20:48.769 --> 20:50.640
I did not hire
a private eye to follow you.

20:50.814 --> 20:52.294
Liar!

20:52.468 --> 20:53.904
MAN: Look, honey, you
gotta believe me. I...

20:54.078 --> 20:55.993
Wait, I'm the liar?

20:56.167 --> 20:57.604
You're the one
having the affairs.

20:57.778 --> 20:59.475
Well, then how did you
know about them, huh?

20:59.649 --> 21:02.261
I told you already,
I don't know how, I just...

21:03.610 --> 21:05.046
I just saw it in my head.

21:05.220 --> 21:06.917
Well, now you can see your ass
outta my life.

21:07.091 --> 21:08.615
You're the one screwing around.

21:08.789 --> 21:09.572
[growls]

21:09.746 --> 21:11.661
[grunts]

21:15.578 --> 21:17.406
Phil?

21:17.580 --> 21:19.408
You slept with Phil, too?

21:20.453 --> 21:21.932
Oh, my God, what is
happening to me?

21:22.106 --> 21:23.847
I think I can explain.

21:24.021 --> 21:25.284
Who are you?

21:25.458 --> 21:27.024
It doesn't matter.

21:27.198 --> 21:29.592
But I do know you've been seeing
certain things, right?

21:29.766 --> 21:31.551
Things that you can't explain?

21:31.725 --> 21:33.466
Oh, no, no, no, don't tell me
you're sleeping with her, too.

21:33.640 --> 21:35.642
No, of course not.

21:35.816 --> 21:38.209
I'm just here to help you.

21:38.384 --> 21:40.342
Look, lady, no offense,

21:40.516 --> 21:43.040
but I don't think
you can help me, okay?

21:43.214 --> 21:45.565
Oh, no, no,
not the bowling trophy.

21:45.739 --> 21:47.088
[crowd murmuring]

21:47.262 --> 21:50.787
My troph... my...

22:00.014 --> 22:01.145
Who the hell are you?

22:01.320 --> 22:03.713
Short version, I'm a witch.

22:03.887 --> 22:05.541
And you have my power
of premonition.

22:05.715 --> 22:07.108
And if you don't come with me,

22:07.282 --> 22:08.805
you're probably going to
get killed by a demon.

22:08.979 --> 22:10.372
Got it?

22:17.553 --> 22:20.469
What's the matter,
don't trust me?

22:20.643 --> 22:23.254
You said you had some
information about the Avatars.

22:23.429 --> 22:25.300
We're listening.

22:25.474 --> 22:27.041
Actually I said
I have information

22:27.215 --> 22:29.783
about one
of the Avatars.

22:29.957 --> 22:31.219
A very special one.

22:31.393 --> 22:32.568
He doesn't
know anything.

22:32.742 --> 22:33.569
Let's go.

22:33.743 --> 22:34.614
You know him,
actually.

22:34.788 --> 22:36.659
Very well, too.

22:36.833 --> 22:38.139
All right, who is it?

22:38.313 --> 22:39.488
I believe...

22:39.662 --> 22:42.926
his name is Leo.

22:44.232 --> 22:45.712
Ring any Elder bells?

22:45.886 --> 22:47.409
He's not an Avatar.

22:47.583 --> 22:48.758
Sure, he is.

22:48.932 --> 22:50.934
He just doesn't want you
to know it.

22:51.108 --> 22:53.415
Probably because he's planning
on betraying you.

22:53.589 --> 22:56.331
But then again,
I'm not one to gossip.

22:56.505 --> 22:58.289
I'm sure if you
look back at it,

22:58.464 --> 23:00.074
it has to make a lot of sense.

23:00.248 --> 23:01.597
Doesn't it?

23:03.120 --> 23:04.644
You have any proof?

23:04.818 --> 23:07.690
I saw his powers.

23:07.864 --> 23:12.826
More to the point,
I... felt his powers.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.655
Made yours seem feeble.

23:15.829 --> 23:17.744
Why are you telling
us this now?

23:17.918 --> 23:19.441
What do you hope to gain?

23:19.615 --> 23:20.747
My life.

23:20.921 --> 23:24.185
And those
of my fellow demons.

23:24.359 --> 23:28.145
You see, the one thing
you and I have in common

23:28.319 --> 23:30.017
is the Avatars' threat.

23:30.191 --> 23:32.933
If they come to power,

23:33.107 --> 23:36.980
you will be out,
and we will be gone.

23:37.154 --> 23:40.114
On the other hand,
if you can

23:40.288 --> 23:43.247
deal with your little traitor,

23:43.422 --> 23:46.860
we might yet be able
to save ourselves.

23:49.645 --> 23:52.605
Tick... tock.

23:58.480 --> 23:59.568
Demons?

23:59.742 --> 24:01.570
What do you mean, demons?

24:01.744 --> 24:03.311
You mean they actually exist?

24:03.485 --> 24:05.052
Yes, Denise, they do.

24:05.226 --> 24:06.270
So I need my powers.

24:06.445 --> 24:07.576
Stay away from me!

24:07.750 --> 24:08.708
[glass clattering]

24:08.882 --> 24:10.710
Why does that keep happening?

24:10.884 --> 24:14.975
It won't if you just calm down
a little and let me help you.

24:15.149 --> 24:18.413
Wait. You guys fight demons
here all the time, don't you?

24:18.587 --> 24:20.502
Pretty much, why?

24:20.676 --> 24:21.503
See, I always thought
that you just threw

24:21.677 --> 24:22.939
a bunch of wild parties,

24:23.113 --> 24:25.072
you know, things breaking,
people screaming.

24:25.246 --> 24:27.074
I had no idea.

24:27.248 --> 24:30.120
Yeah, well, at least now you
know why we never invited you.

24:30.294 --> 24:31.382
Found my...[Denise shrieks]

24:33.646 --> 24:36.562
See, that's that
other little power

24:36.736 --> 24:37.867
I was telling
you about.

24:38.041 --> 24:39.042
Okay, so small
gesture here,

24:39.216 --> 24:41.044
small, nothing
too hard,

24:41.218 --> 24:43.307
don't want to blow up
the sister, okay?

24:43.482 --> 24:45.353
...power. Frozen?

24:45.527 --> 24:47.007
Yeah.

24:47.181 --> 24:48.138
Hi. I'm Phoebe, and you're...?

24:48.312 --> 24:49.531
Really scared.

24:49.705 --> 24:51.620
Yeah, really,
don't startle her.

24:51.794 --> 24:54.362
Uh-huh. Hey, ladies, what do
you say we cut the chitchat

24:54.536 --> 24:55.581
and just fix this, huh?

24:55.755 --> 24:57.757
You got it, Ronnie,
let's do it.

24:57.931 --> 24:59.889
Wait, uh, what exactly
are you going to do?

25:00.063 --> 25:01.369
Oh, just a little spell.

25:01.543 --> 25:03.240
You're going to say it,
we're going to say it,

25:03.414 --> 25:04.894
and then everything
should be back to normal.

25:05.068 --> 25:06.940
And then you can go home
and never tell anyone

25:07.114 --> 25:09.116
ever, ever, ever
about this.

25:09.290 --> 25:10.204
Okay? Sounds
good, huh?

25:10.378 --> 25:11.466
Gather around.

25:11.640 --> 25:12.772
Ho-hold on.
Wait, wait, wait.

25:12.946 --> 25:14.338
What if, say,
you wanted

25:14.513 --> 25:15.601
to use your powers
for something

25:15.775 --> 25:16.819
besides fighting demons?

25:16.993 --> 25:17.907
Like, uh...

25:18.081 --> 25:19.256
winning the lottery?

25:19.430 --> 25:20.954
[sighs]

25:21.128 --> 25:22.782
No, my premonitions
are much bigger than that.

25:22.956 --> 25:24.610
What's bigger
than winning the lottery?

25:24.784 --> 25:26.481
DENISE:
Yeah, how about getting
back at people

25:26.655 --> 25:28.570
who were really mean to you?
Ever do that?

25:28.744 --> 25:30.311
No, no.

25:30.485 --> 25:31.921
'Cause that's under the
category of personal gain,

25:32.095 --> 25:34.663
and with the risk of
exposure, those are

25:34.837 --> 25:36.404
really, really bad things
in the witch world.

25:36.578 --> 25:37.927
Time's a-wastin'.

25:38.101 --> 25:39.755
DENISE: No, no, no, I'm
talking really mean.

25:39.929 --> 25:42.323
Like say an ex-husband who
clears out your savings account,

25:42.497 --> 25:43.759
runs off with his secretary,

25:43.933 --> 25:45.892
and leaves you mortgaged
to the hilt?

25:46.066 --> 25:47.546
RON:
See,

25:47.720 --> 25:49.591
you guys could get rich
and get revenge

25:49.765 --> 25:50.592
on whoever you wanted.

25:50.766 --> 25:51.811
No, we couldn't.

25:51.985 --> 25:53.073
I don't believe you.

25:53.247 --> 25:54.814
Yeah, me neither.

25:54.988 --> 25:56.903
What do you say
we go get rich?

25:57.077 --> 25:58.687
Okay, but only if
we can blow up my
ex-husband afterwards.

25:58.861 --> 26:00.167
Sure.

26:00.341 --> 26:01.516
No, no, no, 'cause
that would be personal gain

26:01.690 --> 26:04.084
and exposure,
not to mention murder.

26:05.302 --> 26:06.086
Well...
Hey!

26:06.260 --> 26:06.739
PIPER:
You can't leave.

26:08.044 --> 26:09.655
[both chuckling]

26:09.829 --> 26:12.962
Oh, I think this is going
to be a lot of fun.

26:21.275 --> 26:24.191
[indistinct conversations]

26:33.461 --> 26:35.637
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

26:35.811 --> 26:38.161
You're going to want to be
extra careful with that one.

26:40.511 --> 26:41.817
Honey, this is going
to take a while.

26:41.991 --> 26:43.166
You want to go
get a drink?

26:43.340 --> 26:44.777
Mm-mm.
No?

26:46.039 --> 26:48.171
MAN [grunts]:
Here we go.

26:48.345 --> 26:50.696
What's in these things?

26:50.870 --> 26:52.132
Well...

26:52.306 --> 26:54.743
I honestly don't know,
but, uh,

26:54.917 --> 26:57.267
I can tell you
what I think is in them.

26:57.441 --> 26:59.618
They thought it was some sort
of Egyptian healing balm.

26:59.792 --> 27:01.968
I went through the
journals of all their digs.

27:02.142 --> 27:04.623
They didn't even know what they
had unearthed, what it could do.

27:06.407 --> 27:07.582
Yeah, they were
completely innocent.

27:07.756 --> 27:10.716
So why did the Avatars
kill them?

27:10.890 --> 27:12.631
Because they knew
what it could do.

27:15.546 --> 27:17.026
Are there any other vials?

27:17.200 --> 27:19.420
No. They all
got destroyed.

27:19.594 --> 27:21.465
When?

27:21.640 --> 27:23.119
You'll see.

27:24.381 --> 27:26.296
YOUNG KYLE:
What are you guys
doing here?

27:27.515 --> 27:29.169
Oh, actually we're, um...

27:29.343 --> 27:30.561
Can you keep
a secret?

27:35.262 --> 27:37.394
You know those imaginary
friends of yours,

27:37.568 --> 27:38.700
the ones that
watch over you?

27:38.874 --> 27:40.441
How do you know about them?

27:41.660 --> 27:43.357
How do you think we know?

27:43.531 --> 27:45.576
Because... you're them?

27:45.751 --> 27:47.143
That's right.

27:47.317 --> 27:48.536
Here.

27:48.710 --> 27:50.190
[grunts]

27:50.364 --> 27:52.148
You're heavy.

27:52.322 --> 27:54.498
There, now you got your own
throne, just like King Tut.

27:55.935 --> 27:58.328
Can I talk to
you for a second?

28:00.591 --> 28:02.419
Don't you realize
everything you say to him

28:02.593 --> 28:03.812
can change your past?

28:03.986 --> 28:05.292
Look, I'm not saying
anything to him

28:05.466 --> 28:06.685
that he doesn't already
know. Trust me.

28:06.859 --> 28:09.600
You can't keep him
from going through this.

28:09.775 --> 28:12.560
Everything that
you've gone through,

28:12.734 --> 28:13.996
your parents' death,

28:14.170 --> 28:15.911
has made you
who you are today.

28:16.085 --> 28:17.565
Don't you see that?

28:17.739 --> 28:19.393
He has to go through it,

28:19.567 --> 28:20.916
otherwise you won't.

28:22.744 --> 28:23.658
RUTH:
Kyle?

28:24.746 --> 28:25.834
Where are you?

28:28.750 --> 28:30.752
You better go.

28:30.926 --> 28:32.188
Will you still be here?

28:32.362 --> 28:33.973
Yeah.

28:35.191 --> 28:36.889
Go on, get outta here.

28:39.674 --> 28:41.458
RUTH:
Honey?

28:44.505 --> 28:45.767
There you are.

28:45.941 --> 28:47.290
Want to go get
that soda now?

28:47.464 --> 28:49.684
YOUNG KYLE:
Okay.Okay.

28:56.735 --> 28:59.085
Piper? Phoebe?

29:04.133 --> 29:04.960
[whooshing]

29:05.134 --> 29:07.354
Where'd they go?
Hey.

29:07.528 --> 29:08.485
Where did who go?

29:08.659 --> 29:11.097
Uh-oh.
They froze us again.

29:11.271 --> 29:13.360
And apparently took off
with our powers.

29:13.534 --> 29:14.970
Why didn't you stop them?

29:15.144 --> 29:17.016
Well, it's a little tough
to do when you're frozen.

29:17.190 --> 29:18.278
Well, didn't you explain
the risks

29:18.452 --> 29:19.540
to them,
demons, personal gain?

29:19.714 --> 29:21.281
Yeah. The demons
they were afraid of,

29:21.455 --> 29:23.152
personal gain
not so much.

29:23.326 --> 29:24.675
Well, you need to find them.

29:24.850 --> 29:26.852
Yeah, thanks.

29:27.026 --> 29:28.592
PHOEBE:
Although
without our powers,

29:28.767 --> 29:30.812
I don't know how we're gonna
convince them to give them back.

29:30.986 --> 29:34.860
Well, we'll jump
off that bridge
when we get to it.

29:35.904 --> 29:37.645
The Elders?
Yeah.

29:37.819 --> 29:39.299
I don't know what they want.

29:39.473 --> 29:41.170
Do you think
it's about Zankou?

29:41.344 --> 29:42.606
Could be. Or the Avatars.

29:43.999 --> 29:45.174
I'll be right back.

29:47.394 --> 29:49.396
PHOEBE:
Whoa, that's weird.
That's never happened before.

29:49.570 --> 29:51.920
Wh...

29:55.663 --> 29:57.578
PIPER:
Lake Tahoe?

29:59.667 --> 30:01.277
[rock music playing]

30:01.451 --> 30:02.713
[laughing]

30:04.803 --> 30:05.934
[laughing]

30:07.936 --> 30:08.937
[machine chimes]

30:10.199 --> 30:12.114
We have another winner.

30:12.288 --> 30:14.334
[cheering]

30:16.466 --> 30:18.120
Here you go, babe.

30:18.294 --> 30:19.469
Keep 'em coming.

30:19.643 --> 30:21.167
You know, I feel
kind of bad

30:21.341 --> 30:22.821
we haven't had a chance
to blow up your ex yet.

30:22.995 --> 30:24.257
Oh, that's okay,
we can do it tomorrow.

30:24.431 --> 30:25.432
All right.
[laughs]

30:31.830 --> 30:34.093
$10,000 hard eight.

30:34.267 --> 30:35.790
Yo, stick man,

30:35.964 --> 30:36.835
give me the horn.

30:37.009 --> 30:37.836
You got it.

30:38.010 --> 30:38.793
[laughing]

30:40.490 --> 30:41.796
Eight the hard way!

30:41.970 --> 30:43.450
[cheering]

30:45.495 --> 30:48.150
All right, that was your
last roll, Diamond Jim.

30:48.324 --> 30:49.848
What are you
doing here?

30:50.022 --> 30:50.979
Come on, let's
go, fun is over.

30:51.153 --> 30:52.285
Fun's just
getting started.

30:52.459 --> 30:53.982
Unless you want
my friend Denise here

30:54.156 --> 30:55.766
to put the whammy
on you again.

30:55.941 --> 30:56.942
PHOEBE:
She wouldn't dare,

30:57.116 --> 30:58.247
not in front of
all these people.

30:58.421 --> 30:59.727
Want to try me?

30:59.901 --> 31:01.772
Oh, sure, now
she's fearless.

31:01.947 --> 31:03.774
Okay, I'll make you a deal.

31:03.949 --> 31:05.907
You try to get one
more premonition,

31:06.081 --> 31:08.344
then afterwards, if you
don't want to come with us,

31:08.518 --> 31:10.172
you can have our powers.

31:11.391 --> 31:12.958
Uh, Phoebe...I know what I'm doing.

31:13.132 --> 31:14.089
What do you say?

31:15.525 --> 31:17.310
Will it win me a
bunch more money?

31:17.484 --> 31:18.920
Not a cent.

31:19.094 --> 31:20.966
But I guarantee you
what you see

31:21.140 --> 31:23.272
will offer you more
than this casino.

31:29.278 --> 31:32.499
Okay, I need you to close
your eyes and clear your head.

31:32.673 --> 31:33.761
Wait, what are you
gonna do?

31:33.935 --> 31:35.284
I'm gonna try to
get him to see

31:35.458 --> 31:37.025
what I've been trying
to get you to see.

31:37.199 --> 31:38.722
How the hell are you gonna
do that with no powers?

31:38.897 --> 31:39.898
I saw it, didn't I?

31:40.072 --> 31:42.117
Okay, give me
your hand.

31:42.291 --> 31:44.859
I'm gonna walk you
through this, okay?

31:45.904 --> 31:47.688
Close your eyes.

31:47.862 --> 31:49.211
And picture

31:49.385 --> 31:51.518
an elementary school.

31:51.692 --> 31:54.738
Outside, lots
of happy kids.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.044
Can you see it?

31:57.437 --> 31:59.308
Hi, Aunt Phoebe.

32:00.614 --> 32:02.094
Aunt Phoebe?

32:02.268 --> 32:04.661
Yeah, that's it.

32:04.835 --> 32:06.315
Stay with it.

32:06.489 --> 32:08.927
There's Wyatt and Chris
and a little girl.

32:10.711 --> 32:12.104
What did I tell you
about the demons?

32:12.278 --> 32:13.757
They don't exist anymore.

32:13.932 --> 32:15.585
Not since the Avatars.

32:17.239 --> 32:19.415
What's he seeing?

32:19.589 --> 32:22.027
Believe me, I wish I knew.

32:27.858 --> 32:29.208
Is that real?

32:29.382 --> 32:31.775
It can be...

32:31.950 --> 32:33.821
if we get our powers back.

32:41.307 --> 32:44.005
All right, Leo,
for the last time,

32:44.179 --> 32:47.269
are you or are you
not an Avatar?

32:47.443 --> 32:49.097
I'm just someone
who wants peace.

32:49.271 --> 32:50.838
Isn't that
what you want, too?

32:51.012 --> 32:52.709
Please, Leo, the truth!

32:52.883 --> 32:55.408
All right.

32:55.582 --> 32:57.366
Yes, I'm an Avatar.

32:58.802 --> 33:00.326
But they're
not a threat.

33:00.500 --> 33:02.154
They seek what we seek.

33:02.328 --> 33:05.026
Oh, what, the destruction
of everything we hold dear?

33:05.200 --> 33:08.334
No, a world without good
and evil, without conflict.

33:08.508 --> 33:10.075
It's not possible.

33:10.249 --> 33:12.642
It is if we have the courage
to change, to evolve.

33:12.816 --> 33:16.385
Evolution takes centuries,
millennia even.

33:16.559 --> 33:19.345
It cannot happen overnight,
it must be earned!

33:19.519 --> 33:21.216
I think we've earned it.

33:21.390 --> 33:24.045
We can't let you
go through with this, Leo.

33:26.047 --> 33:27.353
I already have.

33:27.527 --> 33:29.833
So be it.

33:34.882 --> 33:36.666
[grunts]

33:38.277 --> 33:38.842
[grunts]

33:39.017 --> 33:40.801

33:49.636 --> 33:51.029
KHEEL:
How do you...

33:51.203 --> 33:53.161
You should be dead.

33:53.335 --> 33:55.772
I would have been
if I were still an Elder.

33:57.600 --> 34:00.516
Face it.

34:00.690 --> 34:04.433
The fate of the world
is no longer in your hands.

34:19.927 --> 34:21.233
We'll get the spell.

34:23.278 --> 34:24.192
I wouldn't bother

34:24.366 --> 34:25.498
with that if
I were you.

34:26.890 --> 34:28.414
Leo!

34:28.588 --> 34:30.242
ZANKOU:
I wouldn't bother
with him either.

34:30.416 --> 34:32.940
Something tells me he's not
coming to your rescue this time.

34:40.165 --> 34:41.035
[Ron yells]

34:41.209 --> 34:42.776
We're gonna die!

34:42.950 --> 34:44.212
No, no, no, you're
gonna be fine.

34:44.386 --> 34:45.474
Just remember
what I told you.

34:47.737 --> 34:49.957
[screams]

34:51.437 --> 34:52.525
[grunts]

34:52.699 --> 34:54.309
[screams]

34:54.483 --> 34:56.006
Okay, he's bad.

34:56.181 --> 34:57.834
Yes, now, if you concentrate,
you should be able

34:58.008 --> 34:59.488
to sense the next energy...Get down!

35:01.577 --> 35:03.188
That was very good.

35:03.362 --> 35:04.972
Thank you.

35:08.976 --> 35:09.411
[gasps]

35:10.238 --> 35:11.587
[screams]

35:11.761 --> 35:13.241
Nice job.

35:13.415 --> 35:14.851
Did I kill him?

35:15.025 --> 35:17.593
Uh... not quite,
but we'll take

35:17.767 --> 35:18.551
what we can get.

35:18.725 --> 35:19.465
Leo!

35:19.639 --> 35:20.901
[groans]

35:22.772 --> 35:24.948
Leo's still alive.

35:25.123 --> 35:27.342
Looks like the Avatar is
more powerful than I thought.

35:28.604 --> 35:30.432
Which means
we're all in trouble.

35:36.308 --> 35:37.961
You guys all right?

35:38.136 --> 35:41.139
Yeah, thanks to
these two.

35:41.313 --> 35:43.358
You, on the other hand...

35:43.532 --> 35:44.707
I'll be fine.

35:44.881 --> 35:46.492
Uh, what happened to you?

35:46.666 --> 35:48.146
I thought you went
to see the Elders.

35:48.320 --> 35:49.886
I did.

35:50.060 --> 35:52.759
We need to talk.

36:06.294 --> 36:08.253
It's time.

36:12.431 --> 36:13.345
[whooshing]

36:13.519 --> 36:14.476

Ruth!

36:35.976 --> 36:38.239
[echoing]
No!

36:38.413 --> 36:39.936
[grunts]

36:45.115 --> 36:47.117
[screams]

36:54.951 --> 36:56.953
We needed those potions.

36:57.127 --> 36:58.477
I told you
we should have waited.

36:58.651 --> 37:00.348
How will we
protect ourselves?

37:00.522 --> 37:03.395
We won't.

37:14.580 --> 37:16.756
PAIGE:
I'm so sorry, I had no idea.

37:18.801 --> 37:21.543
Neither did I.

37:21.717 --> 37:23.676
I never really saw
what happened.

37:25.721 --> 37:27.506
I thought I did,

37:27.680 --> 37:30.204
but I just assumed it was the
Avatars because of the vials.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.774
At least now we know
it wasn't them.

37:36.819 --> 37:39.431
It doesn't help.

37:39.605 --> 37:40.432
YOUNG KYLE:
Mom?

37:40.606 --> 37:41.563
Dad?

37:41.737 --> 37:43.391
[jet engine roaring overhead]

37:44.827 --> 37:46.655
Daddy!

37:48.396 --> 37:50.659
[sniffling]

37:50.833 --> 37:52.922
[whispering]:
Daddy?

37:53.096 --> 37:56.274
Daddy, no. Please.

38:16.381 --> 38:17.556
Kyle, look at me.

38:17.730 --> 38:19.209
[sniffling]

38:19.384 --> 38:21.777
Kyle...

38:25.651 --> 38:26.739
You're gonna be okay.

38:27.957 --> 38:31.091
We're gonna get
through this, all right?

38:33.093 --> 38:35.095
Promise.

38:37.053 --> 38:40.143
We have to go.

39:13.786 --> 39:15.004
Hey, do you mind?

39:15.178 --> 39:16.702
Sorry, just checking.

39:16.876 --> 39:19.313
Oh, it's okay, I never liked
that lamp really anyway.

39:19.487 --> 39:20.880
I don't know how much good

39:21.054 --> 39:22.490
having our powers back
is gonna do anyway.

39:22.664 --> 39:23.970
They didn't seem
to phase Zankou.

39:24.144 --> 39:25.885
Zankou.

39:26.059 --> 39:27.539
How do they come up
with these names?

39:27.713 --> 39:29.715
After all these years,
you're gonna ask now?

39:29.889 --> 39:30.890
[chuckles]

39:31.064 --> 39:32.544
Well, at least Denise and Ronnie

39:32.718 --> 39:34.459
get to go back
to their normal lives.

39:34.633 --> 39:36.243
Did Leo use
the memory dust on them?

39:36.417 --> 39:37.418
Yeah.

39:37.592 --> 39:38.941
Although, it's kind of a shame,

39:39.115 --> 39:40.508
considering everything
they went through.

39:40.682 --> 39:43.903
I mean, Ronnie got to see
a better future.

39:44.077 --> 39:45.861
Yeah.

39:46.035 --> 39:48.255
It's too bad you didn't get to
see the future that Ronnie saw.

39:48.429 --> 39:50.736
I don't think I need to.

39:50.910 --> 39:53.129
I mean, I saw how
just one glimpse

39:53.303 --> 39:55.175
changed that man forever.

39:55.349 --> 39:57.090
And the fact that
the Avatars aren't killers

39:57.264 --> 39:58.439
helps a little bit.

39:58.613 --> 39:59.397
That's enough for me.

39:59.571 --> 40:01.224
Really?

40:01.399 --> 40:02.400
Yeah, hell, it's worth a shot.

40:02.574 --> 40:03.792
It's got to be better than

40:03.966 --> 40:04.924
cleaning up after demons
all the time.

40:05.098 --> 40:06.404
PAIGE:
I agree.

40:09.232 --> 40:10.582
I've been thinking
about it,

40:10.756 --> 40:12.845
and, um...

40:13.019 --> 40:14.237
I'm ready to try, too.

40:14.412 --> 40:15.848
Because...

40:16.022 --> 40:17.763
I'm tired of
all of...

40:17.937 --> 40:18.851
[banister creaking]

40:19.025 --> 40:21.114
...this.

40:21.288 --> 40:22.463
How's Kyle doing?

40:23.464 --> 40:25.858
He's pretty devastated,
you know?

40:26.032 --> 40:28.774
But... I think
eventually

40:28.948 --> 40:30.776
he'll be okay.

40:30.950 --> 40:32.560
I mean, you have to be.

40:32.734 --> 40:33.996
It's Utopia, right?
