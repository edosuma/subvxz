15:05.447 --> 15:08.063
You get to keep all
the good stuff, like
your new friend Gretchen.

15:08.158 --> 15:09.819
Am I right?
Close enough.

15:09.910 --> 15:13.198
I will do my best, Claire,
but life isn't
always that simple.

15:13.830 --> 15:16.321
I'm gonna get inside the room
and see what I can find.

15:16.458 --> 15:18.244
It's that one
on the end.
Okay.

15:18.335 --> 15:21.247
All right, Claire, why don't
you go on back to the dorm,
back to your friend?

15:21.338 --> 15:22.453
I'm coming with you,
Claire.

15:23.507 --> 15:25.668
What? No, no, no, no.

15:25.801 --> 15:28.338
We just went over the rules.
Don't you remember
what the rules are?

15:28.470 --> 15:30.631
You are not supposed to
wipe Gretchen's memory.

15:31.723 --> 15:33.338
She must be
a really good friend.

15:34.351 --> 15:36.216
Dad, just please...

15:36.353 --> 15:39.186
He's not going to
erase Gretchen's memory.

15:39.314 --> 15:41.225
He's going with you
so that if Becky comes near,

15:41.316 --> 15:43.557
she won't be able
to stay invisible.

15:45.487 --> 15:46.727
Okay?

15:46.988 --> 15:48.148
Oh.

15:48.865 --> 15:51.356
That's actually
a really good plan.

15:51.493 --> 15:53.700
This is not
my first rodeo.

15:54.204 --> 15:55.489
Thanks, Dad.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.487
We'll regroup soon.

16:06.299 --> 16:07.880
Come on, Rene.

16:13.390 --> 16:14.755
MATT: He was helping you.

16:14.850 --> 16:15.930
SYLAR: Exactly.

16:16.560 --> 16:20.599
In his death,
he has helped me prove
a point about the line.

16:21.189 --> 16:22.474
What line?

16:22.566 --> 16:25.558
The one I can cross
and you can't.
Ah.

16:25.652 --> 16:28.815
The one that says I can do
anything lwant, like
killing people in cold blood.

16:28.905 --> 16:30.156
No. You can'tjust...

16:30.240 --> 16:32.572
The world is
my hostage, Matt.

16:32.659 --> 16:33.990
Anybody.

16:35.162 --> 16:37.574
Anytime.
So no more sabotage, okay?

16:37.664 --> 16:41.907
Because I'm the one
who's in control here.
Do you understand me?

16:43.503 --> 16:46.870
I'm sorry,
I don't think I heard you.

16:49.759 --> 16:50.885
Yes.

16:51.845 --> 16:53.051
I understand you.

16:56.892 --> 16:58.223
Good.

17:03.607 --> 17:05.518
(PANTING)

17:08.361 --> 17:09.396
Hey.

17:11.323 --> 17:13.188
I'm fine. I'm fine.

17:18.955 --> 17:20.331
(EXHALES)

17:23.793 --> 17:26.660
I can't.
Too many people need help.

17:28.673 --> 17:31.631
This power keeps
draining out of me
and then it comes back.

17:31.760 --> 17:34.376
And then it drains out
of me again.

17:35.639 --> 17:38.221
Maybe you shouldn't
use it anymore.

17:38.475 --> 17:39.840
(LAUGHS)

17:39.935 --> 17:41.675
And be ordinary?

17:46.274 --> 17:48.515
I gotta get back in there.

17:50.195 --> 17:51.810
(EXHALES) Thanks.

17:52.948 --> 17:54.734
You know,
they could use your help.

17:54.824 --> 17:58.191
Earlier, I saw you
with the suture.

17:59.329 --> 18:00.910
Where'd you learn
how to do that?

18:00.997 --> 18:02.157
Clown college.

18:02.249 --> 18:05.036
(LAUGHS) Clown college.
Seriously?

18:09.005 --> 18:10.620
Medical school.

18:11.299 --> 18:12.880
I dropped out.

18:29.025 --> 18:31.767
You're packing.
Why are you packing?

18:31.861 --> 18:33.897
Because I'm going home.

18:34.489 --> 18:35.524
Maybe forever.

18:36.366 --> 18:37.947
No! No, no, no.
You can't do that.

18:38.034 --> 18:39.820
I told you that
I was gonna handle it.

18:39.911 --> 18:42.527
With what? Baby powder?

18:42.664 --> 18:44.871
That doesn't exactly
inspire confidence.

18:45.000 --> 18:49.494
I know. I know.
And that's why
I called my dad.

18:53.216 --> 18:55.298
You're too important.

18:56.469 --> 18:57.754
To me.

18:59.180 --> 19:01.592
I just don't want
to lose you.

19:05.228 --> 19:08.140
I'm sorry.
I already booked my flight.

19:08.231 --> 19:10.472
Wait, wait, wait.
You don't understand, okay?

19:10.567 --> 19:14.435
This is Rene. And he can
keep Becky from being
able to turn invisible.

19:14.529 --> 19:16.360
I'm scared
for my life, okay?

19:16.448 --> 19:17.437
I know.

19:17.532 --> 19:19.898
Do you?
Because Becky's after me.

19:19.993 --> 19:22.279
She's not after you
because you can't get hurt.

19:22.370 --> 19:23.826
But I can.

19:25.123 --> 19:28.411
Gretchen. Gretchen,
everything's gonna be fine.

19:28.543 --> 19:31.000
Okay? My dad and I
have done this
a thousand times.

19:31.087 --> 19:36.377
Exactly! This is
everyday life for you.
But it's not for me.

19:38.553 --> 19:40.714
I'm just not like you.

19:51.775 --> 19:54.767
Stay with her, please.
Till she gets on the plane.

20:01.534 --> 20:02.523
(SNIFFLES)

20:10.627 --> 20:11.958
Can I help you?

20:13.880 --> 20:14.915
Possibly.

20:15.799 --> 20:16.879
Hopefully.

20:21.513 --> 20:24.471
I apologize for this
awkward introduction.

20:25.141 --> 20:27.052
And my even more
awkward agenda.

20:27.143 --> 20:31.227
My name's Samuel,
and I'm here looking
for my niece, Rebecca.

20:31.314 --> 20:32.645
Becky.

20:33.733 --> 20:36.770
And why would I know
where your niece is?

20:37.362 --> 20:40.320
Because she told me
who you are, Claire.

20:41.157 --> 20:46.277
At least a little bit.
I know you're special.
Like her. Like me.

20:46.746 --> 20:49.237
I know you're asking yourself
right about now,
"Who is this guy?

20:49.332 --> 20:52.039
"What could he possibly
know about me?"

20:52.836 --> 20:54.497
Yeah, something like that.

20:54.629 --> 20:56.665
I also know it's very hard
to trust anyone in this world,

20:56.798 --> 20:59.255
being one of us.

21:00.510 --> 21:02.250
So why should I trust you?

21:02.345 --> 21:03.551
You shouldn't.

21:04.222 --> 21:06.463
Not until
you hear me out.

21:07.308 --> 21:08.764
If you have
a moment to listen,

21:08.852 --> 21:11.343
I might have
some answers for you.

21:37.881 --> 21:39.212
(DOOR CLOSES)

21:47.932 --> 21:50.344
MR. BENNET:
I had a partner
like you once.

21:51.144 --> 21:56.184
As I recall, about
10,000 volts of electricity
should make you materialize.

21:58.234 --> 21:59.770
And then some.

22:01.571 --> 22:04.062
I don't wanna
have to use this.

22:05.909 --> 22:08.571
Why do I find that
hard to believe?

22:15.126 --> 22:16.866
Just you today?

22:16.961 --> 22:19.577
I'm actually
hungry enough
to eat for two.

22:22.091 --> 22:26.050
If memory serves,
the Tahitian pancakes
here are really good.

22:26.137 --> 22:27.673
And a Coke.

22:28.473 --> 22:29.838
Uh...

22:29.933 --> 22:31.343
A Diet Coke.

22:31.434 --> 22:35.768
I say go for the real thing.
Life's too short
for artificial sweeteners.

22:35.939 --> 22:37.179
Well, amen to that.

22:39.108 --> 22:41.941
Lyneﬂe.
Regular Coke it is.

22:42.362 --> 22:43.397
(LAUGHS)

22:45.281 --> 22:48.614
Oh. She's so sweet.
Isn't Lynette so sweet?

22:48.701 --> 22:50.032
Funny story,

22:50.995 --> 22:52.951
I tried to kill
a waitress here once.

22:54.207 --> 22:55.617
You can't kill her.

22:55.708 --> 22:58.415
I'm sorry, did you miss
my whole "the world is
my hostage" bit earlier?

22:58.503 --> 23:02.496
No. I got it, I got it.
I've done nothing.
And I've kept quiet.

23:02.632 --> 23:05.294
And now,
I want you to talk.

23:05.385 --> 23:07.717
Hostages are used
to get things
that you want.

23:07.804 --> 23:09.840
And lwant
to know everything.

23:09.973 --> 23:14.307
Exactly how I ended up
in your head and
where the hell my body is.

23:16.896 --> 23:18.056
No.

23:23.194 --> 23:25.856
It's nice
and isolated back there.

23:27.365 --> 23:29.822
Nobody'd ever
hear her scream.

23:31.160 --> 23:32.570
Come on.

23:42.171 --> 23:45.163
Stop. Please.
Come on, stop it.

23:47.218 --> 23:48.674
Okay, fine.

23:49.887 --> 23:52.503
Just tell me
what I want to know.

23:55.018 --> 23:56.508
Your choice.

23:57.186 --> 23:59.313
Her life is in your hands.

24:03.109 --> 24:05.691
Did you need something,
sweetheart?

24:05.778 --> 24:08.030
As a matter of fact,
I do.

24:10.950 --> 24:12.906
All right!
Fine, fine.

24:13.036 --> 24:16.028
I will tell you anything
you wanna know.

24:19.417 --> 24:20.657
Thank you very much.

24:20.752 --> 24:21.741
(LAUGHS)

24:26.382 --> 24:28.168
So you can
move the earth?

24:29.636 --> 24:31.376
Something like that.

24:31.471 --> 24:33.678
We're all like you.
A family of sorts.

24:33.765 --> 24:36.427
People with
extraordinary abilities.

24:38.478 --> 24:41.470
Rebecca came to us
when she was still
very young...

24:41.564 --> 24:43.395
So she's not really
your niece.

24:43.483 --> 24:45.815
A family is more than blood.

24:46.819 --> 24:49.982
It's about trust.
About love.

24:50.657 --> 24:54.241
About those
who embrace you,
the real you.

24:55.286 --> 24:56.446
Unconditionally.

24:57.455 --> 25:00.492
Becky pushed my roommate
out the window.
Do you embrace that?

25:00.583 --> 25:02.414
No, of course not.

25:02.502 --> 25:04.788
But Rebecca is complicated.

25:05.755 --> 25:08.246
Her father was murdered
when she was just
five years old.

25:08.841 --> 25:10.832
Okay, but
how is that my fault?

25:11.219 --> 25:12.299
It's not.

25:13.012 --> 25:14.798
You're not the one
she's after.

25:16.432 --> 25:18.263
BECKY: It's all about you.

25:19.268 --> 25:21.304
I'm sorry.
Do I know you?

25:21.771 --> 25:24.103
You don't remember me
at all?

25:24.691 --> 25:27.774
Well, I guess you wouldn't.
You never saw me.

25:28.444 --> 25:30.184
But I remember you.

25:31.322 --> 25:33.699
l was five
when you came to my house.

25:34.283 --> 25:37.150
When you tried
to take me
and my dad away.

25:37.286 --> 25:39.698
He told me
to stay out of sight.
(SHUSHING)

25:39.789 --> 25:41.825
I’d never seen
him so scared.

25:48.631 --> 25:49.962
(GUN FIRES)

25:50.049 --> 25:51.710
CLAIRE: And then
in came my dad?

25:51.801 --> 25:53.462
(GUN FIRING)

25:53.553 --> 25:56.044
Shooting first,
asking questions later.

25:56.139 --> 25:57.595
Well, I'm sure
he had a good reason.

25:57.682 --> 25:59.638
The reason is
we were different.

25:59.726 --> 26:01.637
"Potentially dangerous."

26:01.728 --> 26:04.185
Your father needed
neither warrant
nor probable cause.

26:04.313 --> 26:05.974
Not for people like us.

26:06.065 --> 26:07.726
Life is more complicated.

26:08.317 --> 26:10.979
BECKY: /hid
under the bed
and / wished...

26:11.154 --> 26:13.736
Wished that
you wouldn’t find me.

26:18.327 --> 26:21.490
And my wish came true.
You didn’t see me.

26:21.664 --> 26:23.245
M R. B E N N ET:
Your ability manifested.

26:23.332 --> 26:25.118
/ kept making wishes.

26:25.209 --> 26:29.748
That the whole night
had never happened,
for my dad to come back.

26:29.839 --> 26:36.130
I have spent my entire life
wondering why I could make
a wish and save myself,

26:36.220 --> 26:37.209
but not him.

26:38.556 --> 26:40.638
SAMUEL: Ithought
perhaps Becky had
moved past it, but...

26:40.725 --> 26:42.431
CLAIRE: She came
to get revenge on him.

26:42.518 --> 26:43.928
Through you.

26:44.270 --> 26:46.181
BECKY:
And then when / found out
that you had a daughter,

26:46.272 --> 26:49.014
I stopped making wishes
and I made a promise.

26:49.108 --> 26:52.145
I'm gonna take away
all of the dreams
that you had for her,

26:52.236 --> 26:54.352
just like you did to me.

26:55.573 --> 26:57.154
I'm sorry about your father.

26:57.241 --> 26:59.527
I take responsibility
for that.

26:59.744 --> 27:02.451
But you're not going
to hurt my daughter.

27:02.538 --> 27:04.790
I'm gonna hurt you both.

27:09.253 --> 27:11.790
Becky, I picked up
your costume.

27:12.215 --> 27:15.628
Oh, um... Hi.
What are you
doing in here?

27:15.718 --> 27:16.878
MR. BENNET: Just...

27:18.387 --> 27:21.925
Looking for someone.
I guess she's gone.
Excuse me.

27:25.645 --> 27:29.308
I am truly sorry
for what happened
to your roommate.

27:29.398 --> 27:30.854
Both of them.

27:30.942 --> 27:33.308
But it was good of you
to send the other away.

27:33.402 --> 27:35.734
I didn't send her away.

27:37.573 --> 27:38.983
Sheleﬁ.

27:39.075 --> 27:40.531
(SIGHS)

27:41.285 --> 27:44.402
Well, it's a slanted
perspective to see
the extraordinary

27:44.497 --> 27:46.488
through ordinary eyes.

27:47.750 --> 27:50.332
Fear is easier
than understanding.

27:53.589 --> 27:55.841
So, how do you
deal with it?

27:57.468 --> 27:59.845
(LAUGHS) By not having
to deal with it.

28:00.638 --> 28:05.598
I simply surrounded myself
with people who,
by definition, are like me.

28:07.270 --> 28:11.354
It's a whole lot easier
for someone like you
to understand you.

28:11.691 --> 28:15.183
Which is why I came to you
and not your father.

28:17.029 --> 28:20.772
We both know exactly
what he would do
in this situation.

28:23.619 --> 28:25.120
No, tell me.

28:25.788 --> 28:26.994
(GUN CLICKS)

28:27.456 --> 28:29.492
What would Bennet do?

28:35.631 --> 28:38.168
I don't mean you
any harm, I swear.

28:38.301 --> 28:40.713
He said
he was Becky's uncle.

28:40.803 --> 28:43.886
You were stalling.
You kept me talking.

28:44.473 --> 28:46.213
You seem to like to talk.

28:47.393 --> 28:50.806
You actually think
that I would trust you
over my dad?

28:52.356 --> 28:54.347
MR. BENNET: Ijust ran
into your niece.

28:54.483 --> 28:57.566
She's not all there,
is she?

28:58.404 --> 29:01.066
Rebecca is
a very disturbed girl,

29:01.574 --> 29:04.657
but in all fairness,
you had a hand in that.

29:04.994 --> 29:06.859
