WEBVTT

00:02.242 --> 00:03.764
I love you too.

00:03.844 --> 00:06.403
I found her.

00:06.484 --> 00:09.763
Where? Where's my little girl?

00:09.884 --> 00:11.724
They told me at
the hospital to go home.

00:11.804 --> 00:13.083
There's nothing more I could do.

00:17.283 --> 00:19.803
I want payback for Debbie,

00:19.922 --> 00:21.303
Brayden Holt.

00:21.332 --> 00:23.211
I'm gonna kill the fucker.

00:23.292 --> 00:25.253
This is for Debbie.

00:27.051 --> 00:29.172
You fucking monster!

00:29.292 --> 00:33.012
He did do it, not that it could
be proven in a court of law.

00:33.131 --> 00:34.893
You know, you're not
who you think you are.

00:35.012 --> 00:37.932
Your true nature will
eventually come out.

00:38.051 --> 00:41.173
What are you doing?
You can't restrain slashed wrists.

00:41.253 --> 00:42.652
Oh, it's a miracle pill.

00:42.731 --> 00:44.853
So, the drugs stop the bleeding?

00:44.932 --> 00:46.411
I understand you, Smith.

00:46.493 --> 00:47.832
You're a loner.

00:47.856 --> 00:49.896
But it doesn't pay to
be a loner in here.

00:50.015 --> 00:52.417
Look, I've got something coming to
you this afternoon.

00:52.496 --> 00:53.457
Oh, fuck.

00:56.695 --> 00:59.097
It's Bea's! She won.

01:05.777 --> 01:08.016
Are you with Smith?
No, I'm just outside the ward.

01:08.137 --> 01:10.736
Get back to her, now.
Those injuries were self-inflicted.

01:10.816 --> 01:12.736
Shit.

01:12.816 --> 01:14.697
Where is she?

01:16.000 --> 01:22.074

02:47.848 --> 02:49.889
I'm sorry.

04:10.770 --> 04:15.050
What you up to, mate?
Yeah, what you doing?

04:15.233 --> 04:16.752
What's the situation?

04:16.831 --> 04:18.192
I'm waiting to give a statement.

04:18.310 --> 04:20.391
Look, we've turned this
hospital upside down.

04:20.394 --> 04:21.394
She's not here.

04:21.471 --> 04:22.752
Well, of course she's not there.

04:22.798 --> 04:24.916
Smith escaped on your
watch, so you'd better find her.

04:24.956 --> 04:27.233
Well, how am I supposed to do that?

04:27.351 --> 04:29.752
That's your problem. But don't show
your face till it's done.

04:31.831 --> 04:34.312
She didn't plan this alone.
She had help.

04:34.391 --> 04:36.192
Does it look like I was helping?

04:36.271 --> 04:37.312
You wanted her gone.

04:37.432 --> 04:40.031
Yeah, I'm glad to see the back of
the bitch but I didn't help her.

04:40.057 --> 04:41.752
You're lying.

04:41.831 --> 04:43.552
I'm not, I swear.

04:43.632 --> 04:44.632
Who helped her?

04:44.711 --> 04:45.752
I don't know.

04:45.831 --> 04:47.192
How long has she been planning it?

04:47.312 --> 04:48.791
Well, you're closer
to her than I am.

04:48.911 --> 04:52.351
Where's she headed?
I don't know.

04:52.432 --> 04:54.673
Get out! Get out of my office! Now!

04:59.072 --> 05:01.831
The last thing she
deserves is your loyalty.

05:02.911 --> 05:04.752
You were nothing to her.
You were a joke.

05:04.872 --> 05:06.752
She humiliated you in
front of all those women.

05:06.831 --> 05:07.911
It wasn't a fair fight.

05:08.031 --> 05:10.673
She used you and you
played right into her hands.

05:10.752 --> 05:11.711
Snap.

05:15.151 --> 05:16.951
- Phone records.
- Get out.

05:22.872 --> 05:24.112
I've checked the audio files.

05:24.233 --> 05:26.911
Smith sent Birdsworth a package.
He must know something.

05:26.992 --> 05:28.391
Well, get me the recordings.

05:28.512 --> 05:30.512
And check if
anything's turned up on CCTV.

05:39.552 --> 05:41.673
Ferguson's losing it.

05:41.752 --> 05:43.471
You picked a good time to get out.

05:43.591 --> 05:45.752
I bet Walford's gonna be
a breeze after this place.

05:48.951 --> 05:53.791
Hey, um, thought we'd all head down
the local for a few drinks tonight.

05:53.872 --> 05:55.012
Give you a proper send off.

05:55.031 --> 05:57.512
Yeah, as long as
Ferguson's not invited.

05:57.632 --> 05:59.591
Mr Fletcher, Governor
wants to see you.

05:59.711 --> 06:03.271
Well as of 10 minutes ago,
I don't work for her anymore.

06:03.351 --> 06:05.072
It's important.

06:05.192 --> 06:07.951
Well if it's a cake, you can
tell her I'm not interested.

06:10.271 --> 06:12.673
I've just finished a
double shift, Vera.

06:15.151 --> 06:16.872
I don't need this crap.

06:22.271 --> 06:25.512
Well, I don't know how she got it.
Don't believe you. Try again.

06:25.632 --> 06:27.673
I found it on the floor.
I thought I'd dropped it.

06:27.791 --> 06:31.872
The swipe card was attached to
your belt. How did she get it off?

06:31.951 --> 06:33.432
The cord was broken.

06:33.552 --> 06:35.834
I thought I'd snagged it but
she must have cut it somehow.

06:35.858 --> 06:38.072
You are even more
stupid than I thought.

06:38.192 --> 06:41.432
I'm sure the police will be very
interested to hear about this.

06:41.552 --> 06:43.711
Listen, I had nothing to
do with her escape, alright?

06:43.831 --> 06:45.711
I cannot believe a word
you say, Mr Fletcher.

06:45.791 --> 06:47.233
I didn't help her.

06:49.752 --> 06:52.673
Vera.
You know I didn't do it.

06:52.791 --> 06:56.591
I will be launching
an official investigation.

06:56.711 --> 06:58.872
And I will be giving your
new Governor a full appraisal

06:58.951 --> 07:01.552
of your utter incompetence
and with any luck

07:01.673 --> 07:03.673
that will be the end of your
career in Corrections.

07:03.697 --> 07:05.177
Now, get out of my prison.

07:14.031 --> 07:16.831
Mr Fletcher might have
been incompetent,

07:16.951 --> 07:18.911
but he wouldn't have
been involved in an escape.

07:20.632 --> 07:23.911
Just make sure he returns all our
property before leaving the building.

07:28.591 --> 07:32.112
She's awesome, man. I bet she's
like been planning it for ages.

07:32.233 --> 07:34.233
Nuh. Franky would have
known about it, alright?

07:34.351 --> 07:38.072
Nah, Bea's too smart.
She would have kept it quiet, eh.

07:38.151 --> 07:40.432
Hey?

07:40.512 --> 07:42.872
Red's a fucking coward, Sky.

07:42.951 --> 07:44.791
That's why she ran.

07:44.911 --> 07:50.192
Oh, but she
kinda beat ya, eh Franky?

07:50.312 --> 07:52.151
If she beat me, Sky,
where the fuck is she?

07:52.233 --> 07:55.151
Yeah. Yeah.

08:00.872 --> 08:03.271
I want you to get a crew
together and teach Maxine a lesson.

08:05.112 --> 08:06.072
Well...

08:06.192 --> 08:08.632
What the fuck's that about?
Just fuckin' do it.

08:08.752 --> 08:12.471
Yeah, it's not gonna happen.
Oh, Franks, sorry.

08:12.591 --> 08:15.112
They're, they're not gonna do it.
Sorry.

08:28.791 --> 08:32.432
You let me worry about
the prison, Mr Channing.

08:32.552 --> 08:36.072
And you can make sure
the Department doesn't interfere.

08:36.153 --> 08:39.153
I appreciate your help, as always.

08:49.312 --> 08:50.751
Franky?

08:53.033 --> 08:54.192
You OK?

08:59.192 --> 09:00.631
Things will be back to normal soon.

09:01.991 --> 09:05.312
What's normal in this place?

09:05.393 --> 09:07.033
Do you think Bea will get caught?

09:07.153 --> 09:09.591
I don't wanna fucking
hear about her anymore.

09:14.711 --> 09:16.153
Right?

09:21.631 --> 09:22.591
Hey, wait up.

09:22.951 --> 09:26.591
Don't go, come back.

09:29.111 --> 09:30.552
Fuck all of 'em out there.

09:32.072 --> 09:36.231
Fuck Red. I still got you.

09:44.711 --> 09:45.913
Kimmy.

09:49.432 --> 09:50.393
Franks.

10:03.513 --> 10:07.111
There's something
I've gotta tell you.

10:07.192 --> 10:08.631
I'm getting out.

10:10.793 --> 10:12.871
My parole's been approved.

10:15.913 --> 10:18.273
Are you happy for me?

10:18.351 --> 10:20.591
Yeah, sure.

10:20.711 --> 10:23.471
You can go back to your nice
life and your nice family.

10:23.552 --> 10:25.192
Good for you.

10:25.312 --> 10:28.871
Hey, you'll be up for parole soon
too, and...

10:28.951 --> 10:30.072
Then what?

10:30.751 --> 10:32.793
You and me?
Yeah.

10:32.871 --> 10:34.793
You're a gate gay, for fuck's sake.

10:34.871 --> 10:37.711
Just go back to your boyfriend.

10:37.831 --> 10:40.552
You got what you needed
from me, so fuck off.

10:43.231 --> 10:47.673
You know, maybe if it wasn't
all about you all of the time,

10:47.793 --> 10:50.711
you'd see that I've
always been here.

10:56.711 --> 10:58.393
Hey.

10:58.471 --> 11:00.393
Hey, I'll get a place.

11:00.513 --> 11:03.072
When you get out,
you'll have somewhere to go.

11:03.153 --> 11:05.631
I don't make plans,

11:05.711 --> 11:07.393
cos they always fuck up.

11:25.513 --> 11:28.033
Ah, handcuffs, capsicum spray, keys.

11:28.153 --> 11:31.913
I just need your
staff ID and swipe card.

11:34.393 --> 11:38.351
OK, that's everything.
Just sign there, please.

11:45.673 --> 11:47.552
Yep, we're done.
So that's it?

11:47.673 --> 11:50.072
Yes.
I don't get a proper goodbye?

11:54.793 --> 11:55.751
You know the way out.

11:57.631 --> 11:59.831
What happened to the old Vera?

12:01.513 --> 12:03.192
I really liked her.

12:05.072 --> 12:06.033
I didn't.

12:32.913 --> 12:33.871
See ya, Fletch.

12:33.991 --> 12:35.871
Catch you tonight for a
farewell bevvie.

12:35.951 --> 12:37.231
Yeah, sure.

12:37.312 --> 12:40.552
Hey, where you taking her?

12:40.631 --> 12:42.513
Transfer to Barnhurst.

12:42.631 --> 12:45.471
Why?
Cos that's what the paperwork says.

13:00.552 --> 13:03.711
Mate, this isn't a taxi, alright?
Just drive, OK? Let's go.

13:24.351 --> 13:25.591
That shit'll kill ya.

13:27.631 --> 13:31.552
Fuck! Bea.
Come on, let's get inside.

13:31.673 --> 13:34.552
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck are you doing?

13:41.568 --> 13:43.455
Police been here?
No.

13:46.267 --> 13:48.554
How the hell did you get out?

13:48.676 --> 13:50.841
Doesn't matter.
Now did you get that package?

13:50.962 --> 13:53.370
You're going after Brayden.
You opened it.

13:53.451 --> 13:55.179
How could you drag me into this?

13:55.299 --> 13:57.625
I'm on parole!
If anyone finds out I've helped -

13:57.746 --> 14:00.356
They won't find out because
you're not going to tell them.

14:00.476 --> 14:04.853
Have you actually thought it
through, Bea? Mate, it's suicide.

14:04.931 --> 14:06.498
Liz, where's the gun?

14:10.190 --> 14:11.154
I got rid of it.

14:16.452 --> 14:18.740
Bullshit.

14:18.820 --> 14:20.267
Bea!

14:21.271 --> 14:22.636
You don't even know how to use it!

14:22.661 --> 14:26.608
You're a hairdresser, for God's
sake. Think about what you're doing.

14:26.689 --> 14:29.097
Bea, please. Oh, love.

14:37.928 --> 14:39.293
Bea!

14:41.381 --> 14:44.633
I'm begging you. Don't do this.

14:45.516 --> 14:46.480
Please.

15:00.410 --> 15:02.456
I'm sorry.

15:08.679 --> 15:10.325
Oh, Bea.

15:10.403 --> 15:12.693
Oh, no. No, Bea.

15:12.771 --> 15:14.899
Please, wait. Bea!

15:16.946 --> 15:18.353
Shit, it's the cops.

15:19.154 --> 15:21.243
No, no, no, that one. That one.

15:31.317 --> 15:32.924
What the fuck!

15:34.651 --> 15:35.853
Who the fuck are you?

15:35.934 --> 15:37.218
Bitch, get out of here!

15:38.785 --> 15:40.630
What are you doing here?

15:40.711 --> 15:43.520
I was never here, alright?

15:43.641 --> 15:45.246
Alright?
Yeah.

15:55.966 --> 15:59.016
Liz Birdsworth? This is the police.

16:09.733 --> 16:12.101
Can I help you?

16:12.222 --> 16:16.397
So, she's not made any
contact with you this morning?

16:16.477 --> 16:18.283
I can't believe she's out.

16:18.364 --> 16:19.811
Answer the question.

16:19.889 --> 16:22.219
No. I, I haven't heard from her.

16:24.786 --> 16:27.436
Well, she asked you to
receive a package. Where is it?

16:27.556 --> 16:29.322
Sorry?
The package.

16:29.443 --> 16:32.454
Oh, we've got a recording
of your phone conversation.

16:32.574 --> 16:36.389
Oh, yeah. No, she just wanted
to send me some magazines.

16:38.314 --> 16:40.041
There's no way she'd come here.

16:40.123 --> 16:42.048
She's too smart for that.

16:42.130 --> 16:43.776
Any idea where she might go?

16:43.854 --> 16:45.701
No.

16:45.822 --> 16:48.070
What's this?
Oh, that's a steak knife, love.

16:48.151 --> 16:50.277
What's it doing here?

16:52.045 --> 16:53.006
Waiting for a steak.

17:02.453 --> 17:04.859
Gimme five, will ya?

17:09.534 --> 17:11.823
Now, you need to tell me what you
know about Ferguson.

17:11.943 --> 17:14.392
I've got contacts at Barnhurst. I'll
make sure you're protected, Kelly -

17:14.472 --> 17:15.717
Yeah, she's got contacts too.

17:15.796 --> 17:17.403
What'd she do to you, Kelly?

17:17.522 --> 17:20.374
You need to cut the bullshit
and start talking, alright?

17:23.063 --> 17:24.950
You need to tell me
what she fuckin' did to you!

17:24.976 --> 17:26.660
Fucking look at me!

17:28.320 --> 17:30.047
Your eye.

17:30.129 --> 17:32.095
Well done, Sherlock.

17:36.029 --> 17:38.679
Why did she do it?

17:38.798 --> 17:41.649
To keep me quiet.
About what?

17:43.816 --> 17:46.626
I caught her with Jianna.

17:46.707 --> 17:48.715
Who's Jianna?

17:48.795 --> 17:51.845
A prisoner at Blackmoore.

17:51.925 --> 17:55.578
Ferguson had the hots for her.

17:55.658 --> 17:58.309
I caught 'em doing stuff.

17:58.428 --> 18:01.961
They were having a relationship?
Are you sure?

18:02.082 --> 18:05.373
I saw 'em.
Did anyone else know about this?

18:05.453 --> 18:08.505
Yeah, a few of us.

18:08.624 --> 18:12.117
When Jianna's bub got
taken Ferguson lost it.

18:12.197 --> 18:14.125
She took it out on us.

18:14.204 --> 18:15.851
Who took the baby?

18:15.930 --> 18:18.419
A social worker.

18:22.835 --> 18:23.798
Then what happened?

18:23.879 --> 18:25.645
Did Jianna kill herself?

18:27.171 --> 18:29.297
How do you know that?

18:29.379 --> 18:31.586
Cos I've heard this story before.

18:32.990 --> 18:33.955
Any word yet?

18:34.074 --> 18:35.720
No, but police are
questioning Birdsworth.

18:35.840 --> 18:38.570
Apparently she was
receiving a package for Bea Smith.

18:38.651 --> 18:40.378
She won't tell the cops anything.

18:40.497 --> 18:42.666
Look, can you give me
the address to the halfway house?

18:42.666 --> 18:43.629
Wait, hold on.

18:47.281 --> 18:49.249
What's that address again?

18:51.616 --> 18:55.190
Everything's messed up.
Bea's gone and Nash has disappeared.

18:55.270 --> 18:57.719
Oh, he'll come see you soon, love.

18:57.798 --> 19:00.449
He's been out for four days.

19:00.568 --> 19:02.575
But there's lots to do.
His first few days outside?

19:02.697 --> 19:05.788
Stop being selfish.
I don't wanna do this on my own.

19:05.907 --> 19:08.076
I want my baby to have
a family, you know?

19:08.155 --> 19:10.524
You're not alone. You've got me.

19:10.604 --> 19:12.129
I love kids.

19:12.250 --> 19:14.176
I'll support you, no
matter what happens.

19:15.020 --> 19:16.265
You don't need Nash.

19:27.866 --> 19:28.869
Whoops!

19:30.755 --> 19:33.164
You alright, Franks?

19:33.244 --> 19:35.573
Yeah, I'm sweet.

19:37.057 --> 19:38.984
Get that cleaned up. Quickly.

19:45.689 --> 19:47.976
I want Doyle brought up to see me.

19:48.056 --> 19:49.020
Now.

19:52.152 --> 19:53.958
How was lunch?

19:54.078 --> 19:57.289
Nice move back there.
What'd you bribe her with?

19:57.369 --> 19:58.454
No idea what you mean.

20:00.742 --> 20:02.428
Still, you have good
reason to be paranoid.

20:02.452 --> 20:05.503
That pack can smell blood.

20:07.928 --> 20:11.500
It's a shame you didn't accept my
original offer, isn't it?

20:12.544 --> 20:14.551
A shame for who?
Whom.

20:17.199 --> 20:19.367
Lucky for you,
I am a generous person.

20:19.447 --> 20:22.258
I am willing to make you a deal.

20:22.378 --> 20:26.151
You side with me
and I will stamp out any contenders.

20:26.231 --> 20:27.758
Keep you at the top.

20:27.877 --> 20:30.928
Let's cut the bullshit
and call this for what it is.

20:31.049 --> 20:32.975
You backed a loser
and now you need my help.

20:33.097 --> 20:34.982
As you need mine,
if you want to stay safe.

20:35.104 --> 20:38.916
I mean, that is what you want,
isn't it Franky?

20:39.038 --> 20:41.726
The little abused girl
just wants to stay safe.

20:50.639 --> 20:52.565
Let me know what you decide.

20:52.686 --> 20:54.251
I told you,
it hasn't been approved yet.

20:54.291 --> 20:55.736
Well, how come?

20:55.857 --> 20:57.542
Linda. Can I borrow your card?
What?

20:57.664 --> 20:59.430
She's gonna want to see me.
That's now how it works,

20:59.549 --> 21:01.075
you know that.
You need to be approved.

21:01.116 --> 21:02.239
Linda, I left my
phone in the locker.

21:02.359 --> 21:03.283
Just let me borrow your card.

21:03.404 --> 21:04.567
I can't do that.
Just ask her?

21:04.607 --> 21:06.896
Linda, give me your card.
I'll be one minute. Let's go.

21:07.016 --> 21:09.787
I'm not gonna leave until I see her.
That's not how it works, alright?

21:09.813 --> 21:11.833
Put in a request,
and it'll be processed.

21:11.954 --> 21:14.483
Well how long's that gonna take?
It'll take as long as it takes.

21:14.507 --> 21:16.650
That's not an answer.
Come back next week.

21:16.731 --> 21:18.698
Are you joking?

21:18.818 --> 21:20.786
Would you like me to escort you
from the premises,

21:20.811 --> 21:23.340
or would you like to leave on your
own? Because I've had enough.

21:29.455 --> 21:32.105
And the police have
interviewed Birdsworth,

21:32.185 --> 21:34.554
but they haven't gotten anywhere yet.

21:34.674 --> 21:35.637
Mr Fletcher.
Get out.

21:35.759 --> 21:38.367
I beg your pardon?
Get out. This is private.

21:38.487 --> 21:41.539
Believe me, Governor,
you don't want anyone to hear this.

21:41.619 --> 21:43.305
I'll handle this.

21:49.608 --> 21:52.015
This is fucked up, even for you.

21:52.137 --> 21:54.666
Here I was, thinking
you had it in just for me.

21:54.745 --> 21:55.748
But it was Will, too, wasn't it?

21:55.870 --> 21:57.475
In fact, it's pretty much
always been about Will.

21:57.596 --> 21:58.960
You are clearly
unstable, Mr Fletcher -

21:59.081 --> 22:01.329
I'm unstable? That is fucking rich!
Please, take a seat -

22:01.449 --> 22:03.215
You had someone break
in and take my journal.

22:03.295 --> 22:05.061
You had Will's place turned over.

22:05.143 --> 22:06.668
The text messages, death threats.

22:06.788 --> 22:09.236
All part of some sick vendetta
because he took that baby away.

22:11.726 --> 22:13.772
Yeah, I know about Jianna.

22:13.894 --> 22:15.298
And what you did
to those prisoners.

22:15.324 --> 22:17.331
You're not a Governor,
you're a fuckin' psychopath.

22:20.315 --> 22:22.363
You really think so?
I know it.

22:24.330 --> 22:27.703
Then I'd carefully consider
your next move, if I were you.

22:27.822 --> 22:30.873
You traumatised Bryant
to try and shut her up.

22:30.954 --> 22:32.639
But she's my witness now.

22:32.761 --> 22:34.847
I'm going straight to
the department with this.

22:38.420 --> 22:39.704
I'm gonna bring you down.

23:06.635 --> 23:08.403
That is just ludicrous.
It's true. She's playing you.

23:08.483 --> 23:09.489
She's playing all of us.

23:09.610 --> 23:11.781
She tortured an inmate into silence,
for fuck's sakes!

23:11.902 --> 23:13.671
You need to understand that Ferguson
is not right in the head.

23:13.792 --> 23:15.079
I've heard enough.
You haven't heard anything yet.

23:15.160 --> 23:16.125
Yes, I have.

23:16.245 --> 23:18.658
A prisoner used your swipe
pass just hours before she escapes

23:18.698 --> 23:20.106
and when the Governor questions
you about it,

23:20.226 --> 23:21.634
you suddenly come up with some
ridiculous story.

23:21.715 --> 23:22.881
Listen, I have an eyewitness.

23:22.905 --> 23:26.056
Yeah? Well we have CCTV. You will be
lucky if you are not charged.

23:26.178 --> 23:28.390
That is chicken shit compared to
what Ferguson has done.

23:28.509 --> 23:29.837
The prisoner I spoke to said there
was a social worker -

23:29.958 --> 23:30.801
Stop.
Listen, I -

23:30.882 --> 23:31.887
No, enough!

23:35.749 --> 23:37.839
Please escort Mr Fletcher
from the premises.

23:43.550 --> 23:44.997
I know the way, Gary.

24:08.884 --> 24:10.009
Doreen!

24:11.014 --> 24:13.869
Do you think they'll catch her?
Dunno.

24:13.991 --> 24:16.523
Depends where she goes, I guess.
Doreen!

24:16.644 --> 24:21.389
If I was her, I'd cut all my hair
off, change my image.

24:21.510 --> 24:24.768
Go somewhere and start all over.
Doreen!

24:24.847 --> 24:26.134
Did you hear that?

24:26.215 --> 24:27.662
What?

24:27.783 --> 24:29.553
I don't know.
I thought I heard someone.

24:29.632 --> 24:31.322
Doreen!

24:31.401 --> 24:33.453
Doreen!

24:33.534 --> 24:37.032
It's Nash. Nash? Nash!

24:37.112 --> 24:40.932
Nash, I can hear you!

24:41.012 --> 24:42.741
Oi, babe!

24:42.823 --> 24:44.069
They won't let me in!

24:44.150 --> 24:45.879
I haven't been approved yet!

24:45.999 --> 24:49.255
What?
I haven't been approved yet!

24:49.338 --> 24:51.670
I'll come back next week eh, babe?

24:51.749 --> 24:53.478
I miss ya!

24:53.559 --> 24:55.128
I miss you too.

24:57.903 --> 25:00.032
I'm pregnant!

25:06.025 --> 25:07.675
Nash?

25:10.448 --> 25:11.454
What?

25:13.344 --> 25:15.234
I'm pregnant!

25:28.826 --> 25:30.996
I fuckin' love you, Doreen!

25:31.118 --> 25:35.340
Attention, compound.
Exercise period is over.

25:35.460 --> 25:38.034
All prisoners return to
your work stations.

25:38.155 --> 25:41.091
Babe, I'll
be back next week, alright?

25:41.171 --> 25:44.106
Just rest up.

25:44.187 --> 25:46.559
Babe, drink heaps of milk, alright?

25:47.686 --> 25:48.932
I gotta go!

26:06.946 --> 26:09.480
Governor?

26:09.561 --> 26:11.209
Mr Fletcher's gone.

26:20.538 --> 26:22.187
Everything OK?

26:24.118 --> 26:25.766
He was saying some pretty
crazy things

26:25.847 --> 26:27.656
about your time at Blackmoore.

26:33.325 --> 26:35.378
That's not true though, is it?

26:37.670 --> 26:39.598
What if it is?

26:43.057 --> 26:46.516
Every decision I make
is for the greater good.

26:46.635 --> 26:50.054
If I have to make difficult
choices, then so be it.

26:51.864 --> 26:53.633
You could relate to that.

26:53.713 --> 26:57.372
I'm sorry?

26:57.453 --> 26:58.941
What you did to your mother.

27:01.114 --> 27:03.807
I understand.

27:03.888 --> 27:08.110
It was a necessity. It was right.

27:09.880 --> 27:12.935
Some people would think differently,

27:13.056 --> 27:16.755
but you made a difficult decision
for the greater good.

27:16.835 --> 27:18.646
Just like me.

27:21.058 --> 27:26.084
My conscience is clear. How's yours?

27:32.317 --> 27:33.766
...to be involved in?

27:33.885 --> 27:37.023
Initially, we started out about
47 metres of trim.

27:37.103 --> 27:38.389
No, it was about 50.

27:38.511 --> 27:41.848
50 meters. And every
time we extended a room,

27:41.968 --> 27:44.824
there was an extra
meter here, an extra meter there...

27:47.800 --> 27:49.407
Still talking about me?

27:49.529 --> 27:51.941
Um, oh, I brought
you something to eat.

27:52.063 --> 27:54.514
It's not much -
Just tell me.

27:54.596 --> 27:56.686
Yeah.

27:56.807 --> 28:00.225
Yeah, they're talking.
And what're they saying?

28:00.346 --> 28:04.568
Cindy Liu, you know from C Block?
Mm.

28:04.649 --> 28:06.578
She wants a crack at top dog.

28:08.750 --> 28:10.841
She's gettin' a crew together.

28:15.787 --> 28:17.395
What are we gonna do?

28:20.130 --> 28:23.186
Well, someone's made me an offer.

28:23.267 --> 28:25.721
So I might just have to take it.

28:33.953 --> 28:37.096
What can I get you, love?
Ah, a gin and tonic, please.

28:37.177 --> 28:38.144
Double.

28:38.226 --> 28:41.491
Yep. Ooh, you're two bucks short.

28:41.610 --> 28:45.641
Oh, just make it a single, then.
Nah.

28:45.723 --> 28:47.173
Don't tell the boss, OK?

28:55.517 --> 28:57.130
I need you to tell
Mr Channing to call me

28:57.130 --> 29:00.637
and I need to see him today.
It's urgent.

29:03.982 --> 29:05.514
Thanks.
Pleasure.

29:20.873 --> 29:23.049
You've reached Will Jackson.
Please leave a message.

29:23.169 --> 29:25.588
It's Fletch.
I need you to call me, mate, ASAP.

29:25.708 --> 29:27.160
I'm going to head over
to your place.

29:27.185 --> 29:28.675
If you get this message,
call me back.

29:33.650 --> 29:36.551
Mr Jackson.
Where's Bea?

29:38.647 --> 29:41.630
The bloke at the halfway
house just sold you out for $20.

29:41.751 --> 29:45.620
If you really want to help her,
tell me where she is.

29:51.062 --> 29:53.440
Birdsworth told me everything.
I'm on my way to get Bea now.

29:53.521 --> 29:55.376
She's armed.
She might do something stupid.

29:55.496 --> 29:57.390
Where is she?
You wanted me to handle this,

29:57.512 --> 30:00.172
so that's what I'm doing.
I won't say a word,

30:00.251 --> 30:01.744
just tell me where she is.

30:03.438 --> 30:05.049
She's heading for the airport.

30:05.131 --> 30:06.621
Gotta go.

30:08.960 --> 30:12.507
Birdsworth lied to you. Bea Smith is
heading for the airport. Right now.

30:12.587 --> 30:14.118
I'll alert security.

30:14.240 --> 30:16.174
Detective, you should know that
Officer Jackson's

30:16.199 --> 30:17.383
on his way to meet her.

30:17.505 --> 30:19.762
It seems he was
complicit in her escape.

30:19.843 --> 30:20.889
What makes you think that?

30:20.970 --> 30:23.228
His harassment of Bea
Smith's husband is well documented,

30:23.254 --> 30:27.138
as are Harry Smith's
accusations against him.

30:27.259 --> 30:32.097
It is apparent Officer Jackson
and Bea Smith are involved.

30:33.063 --> 30:34.474
Isn't that right, Vera?

30:36.771 --> 30:38.061
Absolutely.

30:41.044 --> 30:42.738
It's obvious they're
running away together.

30:42.762 --> 30:45.519
Well, they're not
going to get on a plane.

30:45.639 --> 30:49.187
They're armed and dangerous.
So are we.

31:56.786 --> 31:58.116
This is so nice.

31:58.198 --> 32:00.213
It's one of Mum's.

32:00.295 --> 32:01.745
Dad gave me her old records.

33:05.069 --> 33:06.480
Don't fucking move.

33:06.559 --> 33:07.810
What's going on?

33:07.889 --> 33:08.858
Carly, shut up.

33:08.938 --> 33:10.027
Brayden, she's got a gun.

33:12.888 --> 33:14.743
Get out.
Brayden, what's going on -

33:14.825 --> 33:17.323
Just get out now.

33:17.403 --> 33:18.371
Go.

33:22.441 --> 33:24.538
Please, don't do this -
Just get down on your knees.

33:25.869 --> 33:26.794
Do you want money?
I can get you money -

33:26.917 --> 33:28.326
No, I don't want
your fuckin' money.

33:28.351 --> 33:30.085
Just get down on your knees.

33:30.543 --> 33:32.721
Please, I can -
Shh, shh!

33:32.801 --> 33:34.979
Right? Everything's OK.

33:35.098 --> 33:38.846
I just want to talk,
alright? Alright?

33:43.643 --> 33:44.611
Alright.

33:46.506 --> 33:49.045
See, I want to know why
you killed my daughter.

33:49.166 --> 33:53.196
Please, just let -
No, you just answer the question!

33:53.277 --> 33:55.494
Tell me why you did it.

33:55.576 --> 33:58.196
I never wanted to hurt Debbie.

33:58.315 --> 34:00.937
You have to believe me.
She wanted it.

34:01.017 --> 34:02.589
What, she wanted to die?

34:02.670 --> 34:04.927
She wanted to forget.

34:05.047 --> 34:08.554
She loved you.
She, she hated being away from you.

34:08.676 --> 34:10.288
When she was out of
it, it didn't matter.

34:10.368 --> 34:11.860
This is bullshit. Bullshit!

34:11.940 --> 34:13.754
No, no, no!

34:13.833 --> 34:15.286
No!

34:17.301 --> 34:23.467
You are going to tell me
why you did it.

34:27.137 --> 34:29.514
Mum made me do it.
I didn't have a choice.

34:29.594 --> 34:30.502
No, you had a choice.

34:30.552 --> 34:32.083
She's the reason Debbie's dead,
not me.

34:32.103 --> 34:34.440
Don't try and weasel out of it!
I only did what I was told.

34:34.467 --> 34:36.744
Yeah, well why didn't you say no?

34:38.210 --> 34:40.103
Why didn't you say no?

34:42.937 --> 34:45.356
I don't know. I don't know.

34:47.572 --> 34:50.072
I don't know.

34:50.193 --> 34:54.667
You put the fucking needle in
her arm, and you don't know?

34:54.788 --> 34:57.771
I'm fucked, you know?
It's cos I'm fucked.

34:57.891 --> 35:00.187
Please, if I could go
back I wouldn't have done it.

35:00.270 --> 35:02.244
I wish none of it happened.

35:02.366 --> 35:03.697
Stop. Stop crying!
Please. Please.

35:03.722 --> 35:05.108
Stop crying.
I loved Debbie.

35:05.188 --> 35:06.639
Shut the fuck up!

35:12.966 --> 35:17.925
Alright.
Is that the shit you gave Deb?

35:18.289 --> 35:19.859
Is it?
Yes.

35:19.983 --> 35:22.199
Alright, you're gonna
put it in your arm, OK?

35:22.319 --> 35:24.658
You're gonna mix it up and you're
gonna put it in your arm,

35:24.682 --> 35:27.018
cos I want you to know what
it felt like for her.

35:27.399 --> 35:28.366
Please -

35:28.486 --> 35:30.703
Do it or I'll blow your
fucking head off.

35:35.136 --> 35:36.184
Hurry up.

35:39.853 --> 35:43.641
Use more. All of it.

35:45.133 --> 35:49.083
Come on,
just stop talking and do it.

35:49.164 --> 35:50.938
Please, I can't. I can't.

35:51.018 --> 35:54.567
Do it or I will shoot you.

35:54.685 --> 35:59.484
Please.
You're gonna have to shoot me.

36:05.046 --> 36:06.376
I will.

36:08.834 --> 36:09.922
I'll do it.

36:18.468 --> 36:21.169
Jesus, Bea.

36:21.249 --> 36:22.861
Bea.

36:22.941 --> 36:24.433
Don't do it. Put it down.

36:24.514 --> 36:26.006
Put it down.

36:26.087 --> 36:29.512
Come on. Now you pull that trigger

36:29.634 --> 36:30.642
and you'll be inside for the
rest of your life.

36:30.723 --> 36:31.690
Do you want that?

36:31.810 --> 36:33.019
Go away.
Is that what you want?

36:33.044 --> 36:36.365
Go!
Don't do it, Bea. Put it down.

36:36.445 --> 36:38.501
Debbie wouldn't want this.

36:38.581 --> 36:41.685
She'd stop you. You know that.

36:41.766 --> 36:44.144
Please, Bea. Not with a gun.

36:44.266 --> 36:47.650
Bea, this isn't you.
Come on. Drop the gun, please?

36:47.732 --> 36:48.699
This isn't you, Bea.

36:53.778 --> 36:58.252
I want you to let Brayden
walk out of here,

36:58.333 --> 36:59.382
OK?

37:04.461 --> 37:05.952
Come on, Bea.

37:09.539 --> 37:11.514
Good. Good.

37:15.303 --> 37:16.269
Brayden.

37:18.690 --> 37:21.348
Get up slowly and walk out.

37:53.112 --> 37:54.886
What the fuck.

38:13.076 --> 38:14.799
Quickly.

38:15.002 --> 38:16.845
The media, I want the area
cordoned off.

38:27.982 --> 38:28.943
OK.

38:35.114 --> 38:36.236
The cops are here.

38:36.316 --> 38:39.518
Let's go downstairs. Bea?

38:41.643 --> 38:42.645
Bea?

38:52.220 --> 38:53.380
Stand up.

38:57.347 --> 38:58.348
Come on, let's go.

39:05.639 --> 39:08.163
Will, it's me again. Listen,
you need to pick up your phone,

39:08.283 --> 39:11.086
mate, OK? I'm just leaving
your place. I need to talk to you.

39:11.167 --> 39:12.608
It's important.

39:25.668 --> 39:26.830
Move back.

39:30.396 --> 39:31.357
Lockdown?

39:31.476 --> 39:33.400
Yeah, we got blokes
'round the back just in case.

39:35.283 --> 39:36.806
This is the police!

39:36.886 --> 39:38.647
Come out slowly with your hands up.

39:42.654 --> 39:46.259
Put your hands up! Gun! Gun! Gun!

39:48.062 --> 39:50.426
Put the gun down and get
down on the ground.

39:50.545 --> 39:52.466
It's OK, it's OK.
Just do what they say.

39:54.631 --> 39:58.798
Both of you! Down on the ground.

39:58.918 --> 40:02.324
Look, I'm Will Jackson. I'm a
Corrections officer.

40:02.404 --> 40:04.565
Get on your stomachs now!

40:06.450 --> 40:08.893
I'm a Corrections
officer from Wentworth.

40:09.012 --> 40:11.697
Hands behind your heads.
Are you kidding me?

40:11.777 --> 40:15.141
Go!

40:15.222 --> 40:20.550
What the fuck! Get off me!

40:20.670 --> 40:23.113
Let go of me, OK?
I was trying to help you.

40:23.915 --> 40:27.039
Bea Smith, you are under arrest
for escaping.

40:27.159 --> 40:29.323
Will Jackson,
you're under arrest for aiding

40:29.403 --> 40:30.926
and abetting an escaped criminal.

40:31.004 --> 40:32.526
Just let me explain, OK?

40:32.608 --> 40:34.090
Take him away and caution him.

40:37.135 --> 40:39.698
Secure the premises,
find Brayden Holt.

40:51.357 --> 40:53.800
Sir, we've found Brayden Holt.

40:53.920 --> 40:56.243
Earlier today, at the
scene of a fatal shooting

40:56.324 --> 40:58.246
at a Clayton panel beating workshop,

40:58.327 --> 41:00.169
where escaped fugitive, Bea Smith,

41:00.288 --> 41:02.773
has just been taken
into custody by police.

41:02.894 --> 41:05.938
The deceased is believed to be
business owner, Brayden Holt.

41:06.018 --> 41:08.701
Son of former crime matriarch,

41:08.822 --> 41:11.185
Jacs Holt, and underworld figure,
Vinnie Holt.

41:11.306 --> 41:14.992
An unnamed Corrections officer
was also arrested at the scene.

41:15.111 --> 41:18.196
Why's Mr Jackson being arrested?
..the escaped prisoner,

41:18.315 --> 41:22.641
Bea Smith, escaped custody from a
Melbourne hospital yesterday evening

41:22.723 --> 41:24.005
where she was being treated

41:24.124 --> 41:26.729
following an incident at
Wentworth Prison.

41:26.849 --> 41:29.693
It's now believed she used the
incident to inflict savage wounds

41:29.813 --> 41:33.379
on herself in order
to stage the daring escape.

41:33.499 --> 41:37.745
Tonight, Bea Smith is to be returned
to Wentworth Correctional Centre.

41:38.624 --> 41:40.910
In other news the 2:00am lockout...

41:58.776 --> 41:59.939
Shout me a drink first?

42:03.945 --> 42:05.185
Maybe not.

42:07.510 --> 42:08.472
Alright.

42:45.006 --> 42:47.408
I'll take the prisoner
to Isolation.

42:47.530 --> 42:50.974
No. Process her and put
her back in H2.

42:53.297 --> 42:55.060
I'm sure Franky'll
be pleased to see her.

43:03.032 --> 43:03.994
Freak.

43:45.415 --> 43:46.617
You know the routine.

44:01.199 --> 44:02.319
Welcome back.

44:17.102 --> 44:18.906
This is Queen Bea.

44:21.709 --> 44:23.031
She's the top dog now.

44:25.836 --> 44:27.356
Anyone got a problem with that?

44:58.604 --> 45:00.167
They're all yours.
