I WENT TO WAS MY MOM'S.

07:11.583 --> 07:13.458
I MEAN, I HAVEN'T EVEN
BEEN TO HER GRAVESITE.

07:13.458 --> 07:16.125
I THINK GOING
TO ABBY'S FUNERAL

07:16.125 --> 07:17.583
WILL JUST OPEN
THIS PANDORA'S BOX OF EMOTIONS

07:17.583 --> 07:19.583

KEEP SEALED TIGHT.

07:19.583 --> 07:24.834

PLANNING ON WAITING?

07:33.166 --> 07:36.041

07:36.041 --> 07:39.250

THAT'S STILL HOLDING ON--

07:39.250 --> 07:42.083
YOU KNOW, THAT LITTLE GIRL
INSIDE THAT'S JUST...

07:42.083 --> 07:43.917

WAS JUST THIS...

07:45.959 --> 07:47.375
COSMIC ERROR,

07:47.375 --> 07:49.917
AND EVENTUALLY GOD WILL REALIZE
THAT HE MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE,

07:49.917 --> 07:54.625
AND HE'LL SEND HER BACK TO ME
LIKE HE DID MY DAD,

07:54.625 --> 07:57.041
AND--AND I'LL HAVE
MY MOM AGAIN.

07:58.959 --> 08:00.542
I KNOW IT SOUNDS RIDICULOUS.

08:00.542 --> 08:02.125

IT'S...

08:02.125 --> 08:02.750
NO. IT...

08:04.875 --> 08:06.458
BUT I MEAN, IT'S...

08:06.458 --> 08:08.208
THAT'S A CHILD'S
FALSE HOPE.

08:08.208 --> 08:10.917
EVENTUALLY YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE TO LET IT GO.

08:11.834 --> 08:15.125
YEAH, WELL, I DON'T
WANNA LET IT GO.

08:19.125 --> 08:20.667
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE, DAWSON.

08:33.166 --> 08:35.375
UH, JEN...

08:36.667 --> 08:38.625

ALL OVER FOR YOU.

08:38.625 --> 08:41.207

ARE YOU OK?

08:41.207 --> 08:43.833
LIKE DEALING
WITH ABBY'S DEATH
ISN'T HARD ENOUGH,

08:43.833 --> 08:45.834
BUT TO WATCH EVERYBODY
PARADE AROUND

08:45.834 --> 08:48.542
ACTING LIKE--LIKE ABBY
WAS THEIR BEST FRIEND,

08:48.542 --> 08:50.667
IT'S SICKENING.

08:50.667 --> 08:51.792
ASIDE FROM ME,

08:51.792 --> 08:53.667
ABBY DIDN'T
HAVE A SINGLE FRIEND
IN CAPESIDE.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.625
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
SHE WAS A--

08:55.625 --> 08:58.500
A BITCH.
COME ON, ANDIE.
SAY IT.

08:58.500 --> 08:59.708
"ABBY WAS A BITCH."

09:00.834 --> 09:02.500
WELL, I WOULDN'T
GO THAT FAR.

09:02.500 --> 09:05.125
YEAH, WELL,
YOU WOULD HAVE 3 DAYS AGO.

09:05.125 --> 09:06.625
BUT NOW THAT SHE'S DEAD,

09:06.625 --> 09:08.834
YOU WAX POETIC
ABOUT "HER GREAT SPIRIT."

09:08.834 --> 09:09.917
IT'S SO INSINCERE.

09:09.917 --> 09:10.959
WELL, I DON'T THINK
IT'S APPROPRIATE

09:10.959 --> 09:13.458
TO MALIGN HER CHARACTER
AFTER SHE'S GONE.

09:13.458 --> 09:15.625
IT ISN'T MALIGNING
IF IT'S TRUE.

09:15.625 --> 09:18.417
BELIEVE ME, IT WOULD HAVE
BEEN EASIER FOR EVERYBODY

09:18.417 --> 09:22.250
IF ABBY HAD JUST BEEN
THIS WONDERFUL PERSON
WITH THESE VIRTUOUS QUALITIES,

09:22.250 --> 09:23.250
BUT SHE WASN'T.

09:23.250 --> 09:24.834
SHE WAS MEAN,

09:24.834 --> 09:29.041
AND THE LEAST THAT
WE CAN DO IS ACKNOWLEDGE
WHO SHE REALLY WAS.

09:29.041 --> 09:31.625
JEN, I KNOW THIS
MUST BE HARD FOR YOU.

09:31.625 --> 09:33.333
AND I AM SICK AND TIRED

09:33.333 --> 09:34.917
OF EVERYBODY TREATING ME
LIKE I'M SOME KIND
OF CELEBRITY

09:34.917 --> 09:38.208
JUST BECAUSE I HAPPENED TO BE
AT THE SCENE OF THE CRIME.

09:38.208 --> 09:42.333
IT'S FUNNY.
ABBY SPENT HER ENTIRE LIFE
SHATTERING OUR FRAGILE EGOS,

09:42.333 --> 09:45.083
AND THAT'S WHY PEOPLE
DISLIKED HER SO INTENSELY.

09:45.083 --> 09:46.333
LEAVE IT TO ABBY.

09:46.333 --> 09:48.583
EVEN IN HER DEATH,
SHE'S STILL EXPOSING HYPOCRISY.

09:48.583 --> 09:49.708
WELL, I FEEL BAD,

09:49.708 --> 09:51.667
BUT I TRIED
TO REACH OUT TO HER,

09:51.667 --> 09:53.250
AND EVERY TIME,
SHE REJECTED ME.

09:53.250 --> 09:54.250
SHE  REJECTED  YOU?

09:54.250 --> 09:56.458
IF YOU HADN'T
REJECTED HER AT THE WEDDING,

09:56.458 --> 09:58.250
NONE OF THIS
EVER WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.

09:58.250 --> 09:59.333
WHAT?

09:59.333 --> 10:01.083
YOU KICKED US OUT
AT THE WEDDING, ANDIE.

10:01.083 --> 10:03.166
THAT'S WHY
WE WERE AT THE DOCKS
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

10:03.166 --> 10:05.166
DON'T SAY THAT.

10:05.166 --> 10:08.542
I'M SORRY, OK?

10:08.542 --> 10:11.000
I CAN'T--
I GOTTA GO HOME.

THE DUTIFUL MOURNERS,

10:23.667 --> 10:25.083

THE SPELL OF THE WICKED
WITCH OF THE EAST.

UM, HONEY, I KNOW YOU'RE
DEALING WITH A LOT RIGHT NOW,

10:32.792 --> 10:35.792
BUT I HAVE SOME NEWS
I HAVE TO SHARE WITH YOU.

10:35.792 --> 10:37.291
SOUNDS SERIOUS.

10:37.291 --> 10:39.208
NO, NO, NO.
IT'S--IT'S NOT BAD NEWS.
IT'S GOOD NEWS.

10:39.208 --> 10:43.166
DAWSON, DO YOU REMEMBER
THAT PIECE I DID
ON THE TEENAGE GIRLS?

10:43.166 --> 10:44.291
YEAH.

10:44.291 --> 10:46.291
WELL, I WON
THE PEALE VISION AWARD

10:46.291 --> 10:48.000

IN NEWS BROADCASTING.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.208
THAT'S GREAT, MOM.

10:50.208 --> 10:51.667
CONGRATULATIONS.

10:51.667 --> 10:53.458
OH, BUT THAT'S
NOT THE NEWS.

10:53.458 --> 10:55.625
NO, THE NEWS IS,
BECAUSE OF THE AWARD,

10:55.625 --> 10:57.041
I'VE BEEN OFFERED A JOB
AS A NETWORK CORRESPONDENT.

10:57.041 --> 11:02.041
AH, IT'S A LOT OF MONEY.
IT'S HIGH PROFILE. IT'S...

11:02.041 --> 11:04.792
IT'S IN PHILADELPHIA.

11:04.792 --> 11:06.667
OH.

11:08.083 --> 11:09.166
ARE YOU
GONNA TAKE IT?

11:09.166 --> 11:13.000
WELL, PROFESSIONALLY
IT'S A HUGE LEAP FOR ME.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.708
IT'S--IT'S WHAT
I'VE ALWAYS WORKED FOR.

11:15.708 --> 11:17.458
I DON'T WANNA MOVE
TO PHILADELPHIA.

11:17.458 --> 11:18.750
OH, I COMPLETELY
UNDERSTAND THAT.

11:18.750 --> 11:20.542
YOU'RE HALFWAY
THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL.

11:20.542 --> 11:23.000
NO, I DO NOT WANT
TO UPROOT YOU.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.667
IF  I TOOK THIS JOB,

11:24.667 --> 11:26.667
I ASSUME YOUR FATHER
WOULD MOVE BACK IN, AND...

11:26.667 --> 11:29.792
I WOULD COME HOME
AS OFTEN AS I COULD.

11:32.250 --> 11:34.375
SO W-WHAT ABOUT
YOU AND DAD?

11:34.375 --> 11:36.542
ARE YOU GUYS JUST
THROWING IN THE TOWEL?

11:36.542 --> 11:38.083
IT'S THE LAST THING I WANT,

11:38.083 --> 11:42.625
BUT I'M HITTING MY HEAD
UP AGAINST THE WALL
HERE, HONEY.

11:42.625 --> 11:46.542
YOUR FATHER DOESN'T
SEEM TO HAVE ANY INTEREST
IN MAKING THINGS WORK.

11:46.542 --> 11:49.834
SO IF I DO WALK AWAY
FROM THIS CAREER OPPORTUNITY,

11:49.834 --> 11:52.291
AND I STILL LOSE MY MARRIAGE,

11:52.291 --> 11:53.041
WHAT DO I HAVE?

11:55.000 --> 11:55.875
YOU STILL HAVE ME.

12:00.291 --> 12:02.834
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

12:05.458 --> 12:08.166
JENNIFER,
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

12:08.166 --> 12:10.583
DON'T BE.
I'M JUST TIRED.

12:10.583 --> 12:14.750
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T SAY
I WAS PARTICULARLY FOND
OF YOUR FRIEND ABBY.

12:14.750 --> 12:17.417
I ALWAYS HAD
THE DISTINCT IMPRESSION
THAT SHE WAS MOCKING ME.

12:17.417 --> 12:19.667
[STIFLED LAUGH]

12:19.667 --> 12:20.875
SHE WAS, WASN'T SHE?

12:22.667 --> 12:23.542
DON'T TAKE IT
PERSONALLY, GRAMS.

12:23.542 --> 12:25.041
ABBY WAS MOCKING
EVERYONE.

12:26.583 --> 12:29.750
BUT SHE WAS YOUR FRIEND.

12:29.750 --> 12:32.875
IT'S SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND
WHY GOD WOULD TAKE
SOMEONE SO YOUNG

12:32.875 --> 12:37.583
WITH SO MUCH LEFT TO LEARN,
SO MUCH TO GIVE.

12:37.583 --> 12:39.542
IT REALLY TESTS
ONE'S FAITH.

12:39.542 --> 12:42.917
LUCKY ME. I DIDN'T HAVE
ANY FAITH TO BEGIN WITH.

12:42.917 --> 12:46.166
JUST REST ASSURED
GOD MAY WORK
IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS,

12:46.166 --> 12:48.375
BUT HE HAS A PLAN.

12:48.375 --> 12:50.959
WELL, IF GOD
HAD A PLAN FOR ABBY,

12:50.959 --> 12:52.750
SHE CERTAINLY
WASN'T FOLLOWING IT.

12:52.750 --> 12:55.875
GOD HAS A PLAN
FOR ALL OF US,
INCLUDING ABBY,

12:55.875 --> 12:57.250
INCLUDING YOU.

12:57.250 --> 13:00.750
GRAMS, I DON'T WANNA HAVE
A RELIGIOUS DISCUSSION
RIGHT NOW.

13:00.750 --> 13:02.834
NOW, IT'S TIMES
LIKE THIS WHEN--

13:02.834 --> 13:05.583
GRAMS, PLEASE, OK?

13:05.583 --> 13:08.166
ALL RIGHT.

13:08.166 --> 13:10.417
BUT I'M HERE
FOR YOU

WHENEVER
YOU NEED ME.

13:15.500 --> 13:20.375
Pacey: I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT JEN WOULD ACCUSE YOU
OF BEING RESPONSIBLE.

13:20.375 --> 13:23.166
SHE WAS DRUNK.
SHE FELL. SHE DROWNED.

13:23.166 --> 13:24.291
END OF STORY.

13:24.291 --> 13:27.458
IT'S NOBODY'S FAULT,
LEAST OF ALL YOURS.

13:27.458 --> 13:29.041
YEAH, BUT...

13:29.041 --> 13:31.458
I WAS SO MEAN
TO HER.

13:31.458 --> 13:34.041
OH, COME ON,
YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING.
THANKS.

13:34.041 --> 13:35.959
ABBY MORGAN WAS ONE
OF THE MOST HIDEOUS CREATURES

13:35.959 --> 13:38.125
TO EVER HAUNT
THE STREETS OF CAPESIDE,

13:38.125 --> 13:41.625
AND YOU
BENT OVER BACKWARDS
TO BEFRIEND HER.

13:41.625 --> 13:44.291
YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T
BE TAKING THIS
THAT HARD, ANDIE.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.291
DON'T TELL ME
HOW I SHOULD BE FEELING.

13:46.291 --> 13:48.125
I MEAN, IF I'M UPSET,
THEN I'M UPSET.

13:48.125 --> 13:50.375
IF I FEEL GUILTY,
THEN I FEEL GUILTY.

13:50.375 --> 13:52.417
I THINK THOSE ARE
PERFECTLY VALID FEELINGS.

13:52.417 --> 13:53.750
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M SORRY.

13:53.750 --> 13:56.959
I JUST DON'T
LIKE SEEING YOU
LIKE THIS, OK?

13:59.875 --> 14:02.125
OH, GOD, PACEY.

14:02.125 --> 14:03.708
DON'T LOOK NOW,

OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU'RE A FRIEND OF ABBY'S.

WITH ANY OF HER OTHER
SCHOOL FRIENDS.

TO DELIVER THIS EULOGY.

A WAY TO HONOR

THIS WHOLE THING?

I--I KNOW THIS SOUNDS
A LITTLE MORBID,

20:34.208 --> 20:36.792
BUT I CAN'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT THE FACT

KISSED

KISSED.

SO HARD NOT TO DO
THAT.

HERE.

ON A BROOMSTICK?

SO FRUSTRATING,

OVER THINGS
LIKE THIS.

21:57.250 --> 22:00.375
AND I AM TRYING
SO HARD NOT
TO DO THAT.

22:00.375 --> 22:01.792
[SIGHS]

22:01.792 --> 22:02.792
[LAUGHS]

22:02.792 --> 22:04.834
I'M SORRY.

22:04.834 --> 22:06.542
SHE HAS FOOD
IN HER TEETH.
[LAUGHS]

22:10.000 --> 22:11.375
Dawson: CUT.

22:14.917 --> 22:17.583
PERFECT TIMING.

22:17.583 --> 22:20.250
DINNER'S ALMOST READY.

22:22.333 --> 22:26.166
JENNIFER, HAVE YOU
BEEN DRINKING AGAIN?

22:26.166 --> 22:28.583
NOT ONLY HAVE I
BEEN DRINKING,

22:28.583 --> 22:31.125
BUT I AM DRUNK
OUT OF MY MIND.

22:31.125 --> 22:33.166
OH, JENNIFER,
DON'T DO THIS
TO YOURSELF.

22:33.166 --> 22:36.000
DON'T MASK YOUR
GRIEF WITH ALCOHOL.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.125
TRY TO FEEL
YOUR PAIN.

22:37.125 --> 22:40.000
THIS DRINKING
WILL ONLY MAKE
THINGS WORSE.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.583
WORSE? OH, COME ON.
WORSE THAN WHAT?

22:42.583 --> 22:44.792
THINK OF THE GOOD TIMES
YOU SHARED WITH ABBY.

22:44.792 --> 22:46.708
SHE'D WANT YOU
TO REMEMBER HER
THAT WAY.

22:46.708 --> 22:48.875
WELL, THEN YOU OBVIOUSLY
DIDN'T KNOW ABBY TOO WELL,

22:48.875 --> 22:51.166
BECAUSE ABBY IS PROBABLY
DOWN THERE

22:51.166 --> 22:53.291
WITH BEELZEBUB

22:53.291 --> 22:54.667
DOING TEQUILA SHOOTERS

22:54.667 --> 22:56.708
AND LAUGHING
AT ALL OF US.

22:56.708 --> 22:58.583
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE
THAT ABBY

22:58.583 --> 22:59.542
IS IN GOD'S HANDS.

22:59.542 --> 23:02.667
HE HAS A SPECIAL PLACE
IN HIS KINGDOM

23:02.667 --> 23:03.834
FOR THE CHILDREN.

23:03.834 --> 23:05.667
REALLY?

23:05.667 --> 23:08.542
GOD'S GOT
A 5-BEDROOM
BEACH CONDO IN MAUI

23:08.542 --> 23:10.834
FOR DEAD KIDS?

23:10.834 --> 23:11.875
JENNIFER--

23:11.875 --> 23:14.708
FOR THE LAST TIME, GRAMS,
THERE IS NO GOD,

23:14.708 --> 23:16.750
AND THERE IS NO HEAVEN
AND THERE IS NO PEACE

23:16.750 --> 23:17.875
AND THERE IS NO HOPE.

23:17.875 --> 23:21.000
THE ONLY TRUTH
THAT I KNOW IS PAIN.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.041
SO YOU CAN JUST KEEP
YOUR SUNDAY SCHOOL FABLES
TO YOURSELF,

23:24.041 --> 23:25.875
'CAUSE THEY MAKE ME PUKE.

23:26.875 --> 23:27.583
DOES IT GIVE YOU
SO MUCH PLEASURE

23:27.583 --> 23:28.500
TO SHOCK
AND OFFEND ME?

23:28.500 --> 23:31.375
I AM TRYING TO BE
UNDERSTANDING,

23:31.375 --> 23:33.542
BUT YOU INSIST
ON DISOBEYING
MY RULES

23:33.542 --> 23:35.250
AND POLLUTING
MY HOUSE

23:35.250 --> 23:37.166
WITH YOUR
DISRESPECTFUL
BLASPHEMY.

23:37.166 --> 23:39.500
I GUESS YOU'RE FINALLY
SICK OF ME, HUH?

23:39.500 --> 23:41.333
I GUESS YOUR INFINITE
PATIENCE AND COMPASSION

23:41.333 --> 23:44.333
AREN'T AS INFINITE
AS WE THOUGHT.

23:44.333 --> 23:46.291
YOU KNOW, IF I CAN'T
JUST--JUST BE MYSELF

23:46.291 --> 23:47.417
AND JUST SPEAK MY MIND,

23:47.417 --> 23:50.000
MAYBE I SHOULD JUST
MOVE OUT.

23:51.750 --> 23:53.583
JENNIFER!

24:18.250 --> 24:21.458
WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING ABOUT?

24:23.458 --> 24:26.625
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO REMEMBER MOM, AND...

24:26.625 --> 24:31.166
I CAN'T GET A CLEAR
PICTURE OF HER IN MY HEAD.

24:32.792 --> 24:35.125
IT'S THE SCARIEST
THING. IT--

24:35.125 --> 24:38.125
IT'S LIKE SHE'S...

24:38.125 --> 24:41.041
SLOWLY FADING AWAY,
AND...

24:44.000 --> 24:45.959
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN?

24:51.458 --> 24:55.625
JOEY, WHEN I
WAS IN PRISON,

24:55.625 --> 24:57.792
I MISSED
YOUR MOTHER.

24:57.792 --> 24:59.792
THE LOSS COMBINED
WITH THE GUILT

24:59.792 --> 25:02.750
WAS ALMOST TOO MUCH
FOR ME,

25:02.750 --> 25:05.500
BUT I LOOK AT YOU,

25:05.500 --> 25:07.959
AND I KNOW
SHE'S STILL HERE.

25:07.959 --> 25:12.166
YOU ARE SO LIKE
YOUR MOTHER, JOEY.

25:12.166 --> 25:15.166
SHE WAS TOUGH,
AND, UM,

25:15.166 --> 25:17.250
INDEPENDENT,

25:17.250 --> 25:19.542
FUNNY...

25:21.000 --> 25:23.291
IN THE EXACT SAME
WAY AS YOU'RE FUNNY.

25:23.291 --> 25:25.166
STUBBORN. OH...

25:25.166 --> 25:28.333
SHE WAS STUBBORN.

25:28.333 --> 25:30.291
TELL HER THE SKY
WAS BLUE,

25:30.291 --> 25:32.500
SHE WOULD SAY
IT WAS GREEN.

25:33.875 --> 25:36.417
SO SHE'S NOT GONE.

25:36.417 --> 25:39.500
SHE LIVES ON
IN YOU...

25:39.500 --> 25:42.417
AND THAT COMFORTS ME
TO NO END.

25:47.625 --> 25:49.708
OHH. IT'S ONLY A FEW HOURS
TILL THE FUNERAL,

25:49.708 --> 25:51.250
AND I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY.

25:51.250 --> 25:53.500
MAKE SOMETHING UP.

25:53.500 --> 25:55.041
TELL THEM
THAT ABBY WAS
A WONDERFUL PERSON

25:55.041 --> 25:56.083
AND SHE'LL BE
DEEPLY MISSED

25:56.083 --> 25:58.083
AND BLAH, BLAH,
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

25:58.083 --> 25:59.708
LIE? YOU WANT ME TO LIE?

25:59.708 --> 26:02.000
WELL, YOU COULD
TELL THEM THE TRUTH,

26:02.000 --> 26:03.333
THAT SHE WAS
A HIDEOUS
ABOMINATION,

26:03.333 --> 26:05.125
AND THE WORLD
IS BETTER OFF
WITHOUT HER.

26:05.125 --> 26:07.417
RIGHT, AND WATCH HER MOTHER
HAVE A HEART ATTACK

26:07.417 --> 26:09.708
AND COLLAPSE
INTO THE AISLE.

26:09.708 --> 26:12.458
OH, GOD, PACEY,
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

26:12.458 --> 26:14.375
I'LL GIVE
THE SPEECH.

26:14.375 --> 26:15.875
YOU'D DO THAT
FOR ME?

26:15.875 --> 26:17.125
ANDIE,
I WOULD DO ANYTHING

26:17.125 --> 26:19.375
TO KEEP YOU FROM HAVING
A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.

26:19.375 --> 26:20.875
I'M NOT ABOUT TO HAVE
A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.

26:20.875 --> 26:22.917
WELL, I'M ABOUT TO HAVE
A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN

26:22.917 --> 26:25.583
JUST LIVING VICARIOUSLY
THROUGH YOU, SO...

26:25.583 --> 26:26.917
SERIOUSLY?

26:26.917 --> 26:28.834
WELL...

26:30.250 --> 26:31.500
LOOK, PACEY,

26:31.500 --> 26:33.375
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO CARE DEEPLY

26:33.375 --> 26:34.750
ABOUT SOMEONE WHO HAS

26:34.750 --> 26:38.041
THE PROPENSITY TO BECOME
MENTALLY UNHINGED,

26:38.041 --> 26:39.625
AND I DON'T WANT
TO BE THAT TO YOU--

26:39.625 --> 26:40.834
ANDIE, WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO,

26:40.834 --> 26:42.583
JUST SIT BACK
AND WATCH YOU
AGONIZE?

26:42.583 --> 26:43.917
IF YOU'RE
IN DISTRESS,
HOW CAN I HELP

26:43.917 --> 26:45.542
BUT TO COME
TO YOUR RESCUE?

26:45.542 --> 26:47.250
WELL, IF I'M DROWNING
IN THE OCEAN,

26:47.250 --> 26:50.000
YES, THROW ME A LIFELINE,

26:50.000 --> 26:51.375
BUT DON'T LET OUR ROLES

26:51.375 --> 26:53.250
BECOME PERMANENTLY
ETCHED IN STONE.

26:53.250 --> 26:55.291
I MEAN, ME,
THE HELPLESS LUNATIC,

26:55.291 --> 26:57.291
AND YOU, THE HERO
ON HORSEBACK.

26:57.291 --> 27:00.208
I NEED TO TAKE CARE
OF MYSELF.

27:02.333 --> 27:04.291
I'M GOING TO DELIVER
THIS SPEECH.

27:04.291 --> 27:07.250
I'LL THINK OF SOMETHING.

27:08.125 --> 27:09.959
OK.

27:21.917 --> 27:24.250
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT TOO LATE
TO DUCK OUT OF HERE.

27:24.250 --> 27:25.333
NO. PACEY,

27:25.333 --> 27:27.500
I'M GOING TO DO
THIS, EVEN IF IT
KILLS ME.

27:27.500 --> 27:29.834
WELL, I GUESS
WE COULD JUST

27:29.834 --> 27:32.125
SLIP YOU IN THE COFFIN
WITH ABBY.

27:32.834 --> 27:35.500
IT'S A JOKE.
I'M KIDDING.

27:42.291 --> 27:43.291
HEY.

27:43.291 --> 27:45.166
HEY.

27:45.625 --> 27:48.458
YOU MADE IT.

27:48.458 --> 27:50.792
CAN YOU JUST
HOLD MY HAND?

27:59.208 --> 28:02.208
GOOD SAMARITAN
OF CAPESIDE.

28:03.208 --> 28:04.708
JENNIFER, I'M--

28:04.708 --> 28:06.959
I LOST A LOT OF SLEEP
LAST NIGHT, AND I--

28:06.959 --> 28:09.333
I DO HOPE WE CAN
AVOID UGLY SCENES
LIKE LAST NIGHT

28:09.333 --> 28:11.625
IN THE FUTURE.

28:11.625 --> 28:15.125
I--I WANT YOU TO KNOW
I FORGIVE YOU.

28:17.333 --> 28:19.333
I'M NOT LOOKING FOR
YOUR FORGIVENESS, GRAMS.

28:19.333 --> 28:22.750
I'M LOOKING FOR
YOUR UNDERSTANDING...

28:22.750 --> 28:26.166
AND THAT'S SOMETHING
THAT YOU'VE NEVER
BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE.

28:33.125 --> 28:34.834
WE ARE HERE TODAY

28:34.834 --> 28:38.208
TO REMEMBER THE LIFE
OF ABIGAIL MORGAN,

28:38.208 --> 28:40.083
BUT BEFORE WE BEGIN,

28:40.083 --> 28:41.625
I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE
THOSE OF YOU

28:41.625 --> 28:43.750
WHO WISH TO SHARE
YOUR MEMORIES OF ABBY

28:43.750 --> 28:46.250
TO COME FORWARD
AT THIS TIME.

29:22.875 --> 29:23.959
[SIGHS]

29:26.583 --> 29:29.959
MY NAME'S JEN LINDLEY,

29:29.959 --> 29:32.583
AND I WAS FRIENDS
WITH ABBY,

29:32.583 --> 29:34.417
AS MUCH AS ANYBODY
COULD BE,

29:34.417 --> 29:35.834
BECAUSE ABBY
HAD A TOXIC
PERSONALITY

29:35.834 --> 29:39.291
THAT BORDERED
ON RADIOACTIVE.

29:40.417 --> 29:42.417
ABBY COULD BE CRUEL,

29:42.417 --> 29:43.875
AND ABBY COULD BE
SPITEFUL,

29:43.875 --> 29:46.708
AND ABBY COULD
CERTAINLY BE PETTY.

29:48.625 --> 29:52.208
SHE SPENT HER DAYS
MISCHIEVOUSLY
STIRRING UP TROUBLE

29:52.208 --> 29:54.667
AND CREATING CALAMITY

29:54.667 --> 29:55.500
AND GENERALLY
TAKING PLEASURE

29:55.500 --> 29:58.291
IN OTHER PEOPLE'S PAIN.

30:00.792 --> 30:02.500
YOU KNOW,
IN SUNDAY SCHOOL,

30:02.500 --> 30:06.375
THEY TEACH US THAT GOD
MADE MAN IN HIS IMAGE.

30:06.375 --> 30:08.875
WELL, IF GOD MADE ABBY
IN HIS OWN IMAGE,

30:08.875 --> 30:12.166
THEN WHAT DOES
THAT SAY ABOUT GOD?

30:13.375 --> 30:15.208
GOD HAS ALWAYS BEEN
SUCH A MYSTERY TO ME.

30:15.208 --> 30:18.250
I MEAN, WHAT SORT OF DEITY
CREATES A WORLD

30:18.250 --> 30:19.125
THAT IS SO FULL
OF SUFFERING

30:19.125 --> 30:22.250
AND IS SO FULL
OF TRAGEDY?

30:25.208 --> 30:27.917
TELL YOU WHAT,
ABBY TAUGHT ME A LOT.

30:27.917 --> 30:30.417
THAT GIRL TAUGHT ME
HOW TO DO A TEQUILA SHOOTER

30:30.417 --> 30:32.041
WITH ONE HAND
BEHIND MY BACK,

30:32.041 --> 30:35.583
AND SHE TAUGHT ME
HOW TO LIVE MY LIFE

30:35.583 --> 30:38.750
ACCORDING TO MY OWN SET
OF VALUES,

30:38.750 --> 30:40.458
AND NOT TO JUST
FOLLOW THE CROWD

30:40.458 --> 30:44.250
IN HOPES OF WINNING SOME
PHANTOM POPULARITY CONTEST,

30:44.250 --> 30:45.583
BUT MOST OF ALL,

30:45.583 --> 30:47.875
WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT
IS THAT ABBY TAUGHT ME

30:47.875 --> 30:51.208
THE SADISTIC NATURE
OF OUR GOD,

30:51.208 --> 30:53.458
AND WHILE THAT KNOWLEDGE
IS DISTURBING,

30:53.458 --> 30:56.041
IT'S TRUE,
AND IT'S REAL,

30:56.041 --> 30:57.708
AND IN A WORLD
THAT IS SO SATURATED

30:57.708 --> 30:59.834
WITH PHONINESS
AND WITH LIES,

30:59.834 --> 31:01.208
FOR THAT SMALL AMOUNT,

31:01.208 --> 31:02.125
FOR THAT LITTLE BIT
OF HONESTY,

31:02.125 --> 31:05.291
I WILL ALWAYS
BE GRATEFUL TO HER.

31:09.041 --> 31:10.041
[CRYING]

32:17.125 --> 32:18.417
Andie: UM...

32:18.417 --> 32:22.125
THERE ARE PEOPLE
WHO GIVE ME COMFORT

32:22.125 --> 32:23.917
IN MY LIFE.

32:23.917 --> 32:26.208
UM, WHEN THE GOING
GETS ROUGH,

32:26.208 --> 32:28.250
AS IT INVARIABLY DOES,

32:28.250 --> 32:32.959
I CAN COUNT ON THEM
AS A SHOULDER TO CRY ON,

32:32.959 --> 32:35.000
AND THEY WILL
PICK ME UP WHEN I FALL,

32:35.000 --> 32:37.250
AND HOLD ME
IN THEIR ARMS AS I CRY

32:37.250 --> 32:37.959
AND TELL ME
THAT EVERYTHING

32:37.959 --> 32:39.875
IS GOING TO BE
ALL RIGHT.

32:39.875 --> 32:43.291
I AM SO THANKFUL
FOR THESE PEOPLE.

32:43.291 --> 32:45.917
THEY ARE PRICELESS...

32:46.834 --> 32:49.834
BUT THERE'S
ANOTHER GROUP OF PEOPLE

32:49.834 --> 32:53.125
JUST AS IMPORTANT
AND JUST AS PRICELESS.

32:54.000 --> 32:57.125
THEY ARE PEOPLE
WHO CHALLENGE ME,

32:57.125 --> 33:01.583
WHO PUSH ME
TO MY BREAKING POINTS,

33:01.583 --> 33:03.458
AND WHO FORCE ME
TO MUSTER COURAGE

33:03.458 --> 33:05.708
I NEVER THOUGHT I HAD.

33:05.708 --> 33:08.834
ABBY MORGAN
WAS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE.

33:08.834 --> 33:12.417
IN HER OWN
TRUTH-TELLING WAY,

33:12.417 --> 33:15.458
SHE GAVE ME STRENGTH.

33:16.792 --> 33:19.333
I'M A STRONGER WOMAN
BECAUSE OF HER,

33:19.333 --> 33:23.000
STRONGER THAN I EVER THOUGHT
THAT I COULD BE.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.208
SHE GAVE ME THAT GIFT.

33:25.208 --> 33:27.625
SHE WAS ONE-OF-A-KIND.

33:28.333 --> 33:31.000
THERE'S NO ONE
LIKE HER,

33:31.000 --> 33:33.834
AND SHE WILL
ALWAYS HOLD

33:33.834 --> 33:37.375
A SPECIAL SPOT
IN MY HEART.

34:37.458 --> 34:39.458
AND, UM,

34:39.458 --> 34:42.875
I JUST KEPT ON WATCHING
ABBY'S FOOTAGE
OVER AND OVER,

34:42.875 --> 34:45.041
AND IT HIT ME

34:45.041 --> 34:48.041
JUST HOW FLEETING
LIFE IS,

34:48.041 --> 34:51.125
YOU KNOW, AND...

34:51.125 --> 34:52.417
I REALIZED...

34:52.417 --> 34:56.583
I DON'T WANT TO DIE
WITH UNLIVED LIFE IN MY VEINS.

34:56.583 --> 34:57.875
I DON'T WANT
TO GO TO MY GRAVE

34:57.875 --> 34:58.834
REGRETTING
WHAT COULD'VE BEEN

34:58.834 --> 35:01.250
IF I'D ONLY TAKEN ACTION,
AND MAYBE...

35:01.250 --> 35:03.250
THIS IS THE WRONG TIME
TO SAY THIS TO YOU,

35:03.250 --> 35:04.834
BUT JOEY...

35:04.834 --> 35:07.875
I AM SO HAPPY

35:07.875 --> 35:10.792
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN US THE OTHER NIGHT.

35:14.583 --> 35:16.041
AND I COULD JUST
KEEP ON TALKING

35:16.041 --> 35:17.083
UNTIL YOU
SAY SOMETHING,

35:17.083 --> 35:18.417
BUT USUALLY
THE MORE I TALK,

35:18.417 --> 35:22.125
THE MORE CHANCES
THERE ARE I'M GOING
TO SCREW UP, SO--

35:31.625 --> 35:33.458
OF COURSE I'M HAPPY.

35:36.333 --> 35:37.125
RIGHT NOW, I...

35:37.125 --> 35:40.708
I HAVE TO GO
TO SOMEPLACE.

35:41.625 --> 35:43.500
OK.

35:44.542 --> 35:46.792
DO YOU THINK YOU
COULD WALK ME THERE?

35:46.792 --> 35:48.458
ABSOLUTELY.

35:50.750 --> 35:53.375
THANKS.

35:54.291 --> 35:55.750
YOU KNOW,
I HAVE TO ADMIT,

35:55.750 --> 35:59.250
YOU HAVE HAD ME WORRIED
THESE LAST FEW DAYS, McPHEE,

35:59.250 --> 36:00.333
BUT AS PER USUAL,

36:00.333 --> 36:03.041
YOU MANAGED TO PULL IT OFF
WITH FLYING COLORS.

36:04.291 --> 36:06.750
I THINK I NEEDED
THIS WHOLE
EXPERIENCE, PACEY.

36:06.750 --> 36:10.125
IT JUST BROUGHT ME
CLOSER TO TIM.

36:14.583 --> 36:15.458
UH...

36:15.458 --> 36:17.458
I'M GOING TO GO
TALK TO HER.

36:28.792 --> 36:31.250
ANDIE...

36:31.250 --> 36:32.500
WHEW.

36:32.500 --> 36:35.083
I CANNOT APOLOGIZE
ENOUGH.

36:36.667 --> 36:39.667
ABBY'S DEATH
WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

36:39.667 --> 36:41.083
IT WAS MINE.

36:41.083 --> 36:43.125
WHAT?

36:43.125 --> 36:44.500
I INVITED HER OUT.

36:44.500 --> 36:47.667
I GOT HER DRUNK.

36:47.667 --> 36:49.125
I COULD'VE
SAVED HER.

36:49.125 --> 36:50.583
NO, JEN, YOU DID
EVERYTHING YOU COULD.

36:50.583 --> 36:53.834
THE WATER WAS ROUGH,
THE CURRENT WAS TOO STRONG--

36:53.834 --> 36:55.083
I SAW HER
IN THE WATER,

36:55.083 --> 36:56.708
AND...

36:58.583 --> 37:00.166
SHE WAS SO SCARED.

37:00.166 --> 37:02.041
[CRIES]

37:02.041 --> 37:04.834
DON'T THINK
ABOUT THAT, OK?

37:06.708 --> 37:08.000
AND BECAUSE
I'M WEAK,

37:08.000 --> 37:09.500
BECAUSE I CAN'T JUST
ACCEPT THE BLAME,

37:09.500 --> 37:11.792
I HAD TO DEFLECT IT
ONTO EVERYBODY ELSE,

37:11.792 --> 37:13.375
ONTO CAPESIDE,

37:13.375 --> 37:17.333
ONTO YOU,
ONTO MY GRAMS.
I MEAN--

37:17.333 --> 37:19.542
OH, GOD,

37:19.542 --> 37:22.750
AND THAT SPEECH,
THAT...SPEECH.

37:22.750 --> 37:25.291
WHAT WAS I THINKING,
HUH?

37:28.875 --> 37:32.542
WELL,
I'M A PEOPLE-PLEASER...

37:33.708 --> 37:35.166
AND SOMETIMES IN ORDER
TO SUCCEED IN THAT,

37:35.166 --> 37:38.917
YOU HAVE TO BE PHONY.

37:38.917 --> 37:41.583
ABBY WAS
THE EXACT OPPOSITE,

37:41.583 --> 37:44.250
AND SHE PUT HER TRUTH
ABOVE EVERYTHING.

37:44.250 --> 37:45.875
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU DID.

37:45.875 --> 37:47.083
IT WAS A MEMORIAL
FOR ABBY,

37:47.083 --> 37:50.458
AND YOU WERE JUST

37:50.458 --> 37:52.917
BEING TRUTHFUL
TO HER SPIRIT.

37:52.917 --> 37:54.708
SOMETIMES
I JUST DON'T THINK
IT'S APPROPRIATE

37:54.708 --> 37:56.875
TO SPEAK YOUR TRUTH.

37:56.875 --> 38:00.542
SOMETIMES
IT'S A BETTER IDEA
TO JUST SHUT UP.

38:01.041 --> 38:05.417
OH, GOD, JEN.

38:05.417 --> 38:07.583
ABBY KEPT A DIARY.

38:07.583 --> 38:10.166
IT WAS PRETTY NASTY,

38:10.166 --> 38:11.750
AND IF HER MOM
FINDS IT,

38:11.750 --> 38:14.208
SHE'S GOING TO BE
DEVASTATED.
