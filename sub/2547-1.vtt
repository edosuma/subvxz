00:36.004 --> 00:39.090
Long ago, when I was a young man..

00:39.257 --> 00:43.595
...my father said to me
"Norman, you like to write stories. "

00:43.803 --> 00:46.598
And I said "Yes, I do. "

00:46.765 --> 00:50.143
Then he said
"Someday, when you're ready...

00:50.352 --> 00:52.938
...you might tell our family story. "

00:53.146 --> 00:56.524
"Only then will you understand
what happened...

00:56.691 --> 00:57.901
...and why. "

00:58.944 --> 01:00.904
# <melancholy violin>

01:14.960 --> 01:20.507
In our family, there was no clear line
between religion and fly-fishing.

01:27.889 --> 01:31.768
We lived at the junction of
great trout rivers in Missoula, Montana...

01:31.977 --> 01:34.479
...where Indians still appeared
out of the wilderness...

01:34.646 --> 01:37.232
...to walk the honky-tonks
and brothels of Front Street.

03:14.663 --> 03:18.625
My father was a Presbyterian minister
and a fly-fisherman.

03:18.833 --> 03:21.670
There is one yonder...

03:22.170 --> 03:26.675
And though it is true that one day a week
was given over wholly to religion...

03:26.841 --> 03:31.179
...even then he told us about
Christ's disciples being fishermen.

03:31.388 --> 03:35.267
And we were left to assume,
as my younger brother Paul and I did...

03:35.475 --> 03:39.646
...that all first-class fishermen
on the Sea of Galilee were fly-fishermen...

03:39.813 --> 03:43.191
...and that John, the favourite,
was a dry fly-fisherman.

03:43.775 --> 03:49.072
The poor without Christ
are of all men the most miserable.

03:49.781 --> 03:51.741
But the poor with Christ...

03:51.908 --> 03:56.079
...are princes and kings of the earth.

03:57.205 --> 04:01.293
In the afternoon, we would walk with him
while he unwound between services.

04:02.085 --> 04:05.130
He almost always chose a path
along the Big Blackfoot...

04:05.297 --> 04:07.799
...which we considered our family river.

04:08.008 --> 04:12.262
And it was there he felt his soul restored
and his imagination stirred.

04:13.847 --> 04:16.891
Long ago, rain fell on mud
and became rock.

04:17.267 --> 04:20.144
Half a billion years ago.

04:21.313 --> 04:24.316
But even before that, beneath the rocks...

04:26.359 --> 04:29.362
...are the words of God. Listen.

04:36.828 --> 04:40.540
And if Paul and I listened very carefully
all our lives...

04:41.499 --> 04:43.585
...we might hear those words.

04:49.132 --> 04:53.720
Even so, Paul and I probably received
as many hours' instruction in fly-fishing...

04:53.929 --> 04:57.474
...as we did on all other spiritual matters.

04:58.433 --> 05:03.813
As a Presbyterian, my father believed
that man by nature was a damned mess...

05:04.022 --> 05:08.360
...and only by picking up God's rhythms
could we regain power and beauty.

05:09.194 --> 05:10.654
Ten...

05:10.820 --> 05:15.408
To him, all good things, trout as well as
eternal salv ation, come by grace.

05:15.617 --> 05:20.121
And grace comes by art,
and art does not come easy.

05:20.330 --> 05:22.123
Norman?

05:27.629 --> 05:30.924
So my brother and I learned to cast
Presbyterian style...

05:31.132 --> 05:33.009
...on a metronome.

05:36.513 --> 05:39.307
He began each session
with the same instruction.

05:39.474 --> 05:41.017
Casting is an art...

05:41.184 --> 05:45.146
...that is performed on a four-count rhythm
between ten o'clock and two o'clock.

05:49.150 --> 05:52.529
If he had had his way, nobody
who did not know how to catch a fish...

05:52.737 --> 05:56.283
...would be allowed to disgrace a fish
by catching it.

06:03.498 --> 06:06.960
So it was
with my formal education as well.

06:07.419 --> 06:10.714
Each weekday, while my father
worked on his Sunday sermon...

06:10.880 --> 06:15.218
...I attended the school
of the Reverend Maclean.

06:15.385 --> 06:17.721
He taught nothing
but reading and writing...

06:17.929 --> 06:22.517
...and, being a Scot, believed
that the art of writing lay in thrift.

06:34.029 --> 06:35.071
Half as long.

06:42.203 --> 06:46.082
So while my friends spent their days
at Missoula Elementary, I stayed home...

06:46.249 --> 06:49.711
...and learned to write
the American language.

06:59.888 --> 07:01.097
Again...

07:01.264 --> 07:03.016
...half as long.

07:30.877 --> 07:32.879
Good. Now throw it away.

07:48.311 --> 07:50.063
Norman!

07:50.564 --> 07:52.399
Norman!

07:52.566 --> 07:54.526
Wait for your brother!

08:02.367 --> 08:05.203
However, there was a balance
to my father's system.

08:06.580 --> 08:11.084
Every afternoon, I was set free,
untutored and untouched till supper...

08:11.251 --> 08:15.297
...to learn on my own
the natural side of God's order.

08:24.639 --> 08:30.186
And there could be no better place
to learn than the Montana of my youth.

08:31.438 --> 08:34.274
It was a world with dew still on it...

08:35.317 --> 08:40.238
...more touched by wonder and possibility
than any I have since known.

09:15.273 --> 09:17.525
Goddamn it! Open up the door!

09:17.692 --> 09:20.528
Hey! What the hell is going on?

09:20.695 --> 09:24.658
- Hey, where are you guys going?
- Chicken!

09:24.866 --> 09:26.826
# <jazz>

09:32.290 --> 09:34.626
Go on, move over.

10:04.281 --> 10:06.449
But it was a tough world, too.

10:06.616 --> 10:08.952
Even as children we understood that,
and admired it.

10:13.123 --> 10:15.959
And of course, we had to test it.

10:17.460 --> 10:20.463
I knew I was tough,
because I'd been bloodied in battle.

10:20.630 --> 10:22.382
Get him! Get him!

10:22.549 --> 10:24.509
You sissy!

10:24.676 --> 10:25.802
Come on!

10:26.886 --> 10:31.141
Come on! Let's see some blood here!
Go on! Lots of blood!

10:31.308 --> 10:32.809
Go on!

10:32.976 --> 10:37.981
Paul was different. His toughness
came from some secret place inside him.

10:38.189 --> 10:40.442
He simply knew
he was tougher than anyone alive.

10:42.360 --> 10:45.488
Grace will not be said
until that bowl is clean.

10:59.544 --> 11:04.382
Man has been eating God's oats
for a thousand years.

11:04.591 --> 11:09.012
It's not the place of an eight-year-old boy
to change that tradition.

12:11.575 --> 12:13.326
Grace.

12:22.210 --> 12:24.170
Oh, God...

12:24.337 --> 12:28.425
...who art rich in forgiveness,
grant that we may hold fast...

12:28.592 --> 12:30.844
...the good things we receive from Thee.

12:31.052 --> 12:32.429
And as often as we fall into sin...

12:32.596 --> 12:34.931
...be lifted by repentence
through Thy grace.

12:35.098 --> 12:36.933
Amen.

12:40.228 --> 12:42.731
Norm, what do you wanna be
when you grow up?

12:44.316 --> 12:45.775
Minister, I guess.

12:47.944 --> 12:49.654
Or a professional boxer.

12:49.821 --> 12:52.407
You think you could beat Jack Johnson?

12:52.574 --> 12:54.451
I dunno.

12:55.952 --> 12:59.581
I think you could. I'd lay a bet on it.

13:00.832 --> 13:02.125
What are you gonna be?

13:02.918 --> 13:05.170
Professional fly-fisherman.

13:05.378 --> 13:07.881
There's no such thing.

13:08.048 --> 13:10.383
- There isn't?
- No.

13:18.433 --> 13:20.685
I guess... a boxer.

13:22.020 --> 13:22.854
Not a minister?

13:34.407 --> 13:37.452
In 1917, World War One
came to Missoula...

13:37.619 --> 13:41.498
...taking with it
every able-bodied lumberjack...

13:41.665 --> 13:44.251
...leaving the woods to old men and boys.

13:46.378 --> 13:48.880
So at 16, I did my duty...

13:49.047 --> 13:51.549
...and started working
for the US Forest Service.

13:54.427 --> 13:57.097
It was a life of timber and toil...

13:57.597 --> 14:00.725
...with the men as tough
as their axe handles...

14:01.476 --> 14:06.064
...and more mountains in all directions
than I would ever see again.

14:08.316 --> 14:13.321
Too young to join me, Paul took a job as
lifeguard at the municipal swimming pool.

14:13.488 --> 14:16.074
During the day,
he could look over the girls...

14:16.241 --> 14:19.369
...and in the evenings he could pursue
his other purpose in life...

14:19.536 --> 14:20.662
...fishing.

14:20.870 --> 14:23.915
# Be Thou my vision

14:24.082 --> 14:27.794
# Oh, Lord of my heart

14:27.961 --> 14:35.051
# Nought be all else to me
save that Thou art

14:35.218 --> 14:43.059
# Thou my best thought by day or by night

14:43.268 --> 14:51.401
# Waking or sleeping
Thy presence my light#

15:26.228 --> 15:29.439
- Preacher, come on!
- Please be quiet!

15:29.606 --> 15:31.942
Shh!

15:33.193 --> 15:35.862
Look at that baby! Preacher!

15:36.029 --> 15:38.615
- Come on!
- Shut up!

15:54.506 --> 15:57.342
Did I tell you what a forest fire sounds like
coming down a mountain at 60mph?

15:57.509 --> 15:58.718
Shut up!

15:58.885 --> 16:01.554
Damn it, the forest fires!

16:01.721 --> 16:05.100
I've got a great idea.
I know how we can go down in history.

16:05.308 --> 16:06.268
How's that?

16:06.476 --> 16:10.272
We borrow old man Seifert's rowboat
and we shoot the Chutes.

16:10.480 --> 16:13.441
- You can't shoot the Chutes, Pauley.
- You can try.

16:13.608 --> 16:14.651
You can die trying.

16:14.859 --> 16:17.279
They'd bury you with full honours.
Tell them, Norm.

16:19.155 --> 16:22.450
- Well, we would be the kings of Missoula.
- Yeah, kings! And famous!

16:22.659 --> 16:25.954
And all of you would get
your photographs in the paper.

16:26.162 --> 16:27.080
I'm doing it.

16:28.790 --> 16:30.292
- I am.
- You'll die.

16:30.458 --> 16:31.751
No.

16:31.960 --> 16:34.754
Let's do it.

16:34.921 --> 16:37.257
- Come on!
- I'm with you!

16:37.424 --> 16:40.719
Let's go!

16:40.885 --> 16:43.138
Yeah!

16:43.346 --> 16:45.181
All right!

16:45.932 --> 16:48.768
# Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream#

16:48.935 --> 16:50.604
Let's go! Whoo!

16:50.770 --> 16:53.023
Oh!

16:53.231 --> 16:54.858
Steady!

16:55.025 --> 16:56.693
I'll get the oars.

16:59.404 --> 17:01.489
Whose idea was this, anyway?

17:01.698 --> 17:04.492
Come on! This way!

17:08.454 --> 17:11.290
# Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream#

17:11.458 --> 17:13.335
I need a woman!

17:31.394 --> 17:33.313
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

17:37.275 --> 17:39.778
OK, we'll put it upstream.

17:45.659 --> 17:47.077
Aagh! OK.

17:48.787 --> 17:50.956
Flip it!

17:55.877 --> 17:57.587
OK, hop in.

18:02.884 --> 18:04.970
Come on! We can all fit.

18:05.136 --> 18:07.305
- I don't think so.
- No, I uh...

18:09.599 --> 18:12.102
Cluck! Cluck! Cluck!

18:12.269 --> 18:13.895
Cluck!

18:15.021 --> 18:17.691
All right. Just me, Norm and Chub.

18:18.608 --> 18:20.860
Jeez, Pauley...

18:21.027 --> 18:22.571
OK.

18:23.989 --> 18:26.700
Then I guess it's just the Macleans.

18:51.975 --> 18:53.727
Be careful!

19:07.532 --> 19:09.200
They'll come ashore.

19:09.367 --> 19:11.453
You got it!

19:11.620 --> 19:13.622
Let me tell you something.

19:27.302 --> 19:29.471
See you later, boys!

19:35.685 --> 19:37.437
On the right!

19:45.403 --> 19:47.405
On your right! Watch right!

19:57.040 --> 19:59.834
Aagh!

20:02.170 --> 20:04.047
Look out!

20:16.393 --> 20:18.478
Right!

20:20.480 --> 20:22.732
Watch it! On the right, on the right!

20:29.906 --> 20:32.325
Right! Right!

20:38.707 --> 20:39.916
Hang on!

21:01.813 --> 21:03.106
Oh, jeez.

21:07.819 --> 21:09.571
Macleans!

21:14.284 --> 21:16.077
Macleans!

21:24.127 --> 21:25.837
Pauley!

21:26.004 --> 21:27.380
Hey, Chub!

21:41.394 --> 21:42.854
Macleans!

21:47.567 --> 21:48.526
What the hell...?

21:48.735 --> 21:50.528
Oh!

21:50.695 --> 21:52.280
Ha, ha!

21:57.744 --> 21:59.371
Son of a...

22:00.455 --> 22:02.707
Jesus Christ!

22:03.959 --> 22:06.127
Crazy son of a bitch!

22:08.713 --> 22:11.383
- You guys OK?
- Where's...?

22:16.388 --> 22:17.430
Preach, you OK?

22:18.598 --> 22:20.141
Sure.

22:41.121 --> 22:43.790
You will go to church this day
and pray for forgiveness.

22:48.086 --> 22:51.798
Your mother spent the night sick with
worry. Did you think of her feelings?

22:52.007 --> 22:54.259
Mrs Campbell called.

22:57.929 --> 22:58.847
Who gave you the boat?

22:59.055 --> 23:01.474
- We, um...
- We borrowed it.

23:03.018 --> 23:04.769
Borrowed?

23:08.273 --> 23:10.191
Boys, what have you done?

23:16.448 --> 23:19.910
Well, you will work off
every cent of its value.

23:21.161 --> 23:22.913
Yes, sir.

23:23.079 --> 23:25.415
I'll work it off, Father. It was my idea.

23:39.220 --> 23:40.722
Whoo!

23:42.057 --> 23:44.226
What you making?

23:44.434 --> 23:45.977
Know what you need on that?

23:46.144 --> 23:50.232
- Ham, cheese, sardines. Delicious.
- I hate sardines.

23:50.398 --> 23:53.485
I'll show you.
Can you believe those guys?

23:53.652 --> 23:57.113
They'll be telling everyone
the class of '19 did it.

23:57.322 --> 23:59.199
I should write an article.

23:59.366 --> 24:02.160
- "Macleans Conquer Chutes. "
- I don't like sardines.

24:02.327 --> 24:04.746
You could get it in the school paper, I bet.

24:05.997 --> 24:09.376
- Chub!
- Jeez, Pauley.

24:09.584 --> 24:13.380
- What a skeezix!
- I don't want any goddamn sardines!

24:38.822 --> 24:40.907
No! Stop it!

24:41.116 --> 24:45.453
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop!

24:46.371 --> 24:50.709
- You hit her, you son of a bitch!
- You knocked her down, you bastard!

24:50.875 --> 24:54.421
- Son of a bitch!
- Please, I slipped, I slipped, I slipped!

25:03.388 --> 25:06.349
I just slipped, that's all.

25:25.410 --> 25:28.288
That was the only time we ever fought.

25:28.455 --> 25:32.000
Perhaps we wondered afterwards
which one of us was tougher.

25:32.208 --> 25:35.837
But if boyhood questions aren't answered
before a certain point...

25:36.046 --> 25:38.131
...they can't be raised again.

25:38.298 --> 25:40.967
So we returned
to being gracious to one another...

25:41.134 --> 25:42.677
...as the church wall suggested.

26:21.091 --> 26:23.426
I then saw something remarkable.

26:25.262 --> 26:28.974
For the first time, Paul broke free
of our father's instruction...

26:29.182 --> 26:31.768
...into a rhythm all his own.

26:44.406 --> 26:45.907
OK.

26:56.251 --> 26:57.919
OK.

27:03.883 --> 27:06.303
They're both marvellous.

27:14.769 --> 27:17.564
I'd say the Lord has blessed us all today.

27:27.532 --> 27:30.410
It's just that he's been
particularly good to me.

27:37.083 --> 27:40.879
North Coast! Stops in Helena, Bozeman...

27:41.046 --> 27:44.257
The year ended with my acceptance
into Dartmouth College.

27:44.466 --> 27:46.176
Sometime before, Father had told me...

27:46.343 --> 27:48.929
...I could attend
any college in the world I could get into.

27:49.095 --> 27:51.932
I knew he earned
no more than $1,800 a year...

27:52.098 --> 27:55.810
...so his offer meant more to me
than anything in my life.

27:55.977 --> 27:58.313
Well, do your best.

27:58.480 --> 27:59.940
I will.

28:00.106 --> 28:02.150
All aboard!

28:14.246 --> 28:16.206
Hey, Norman! Norm!

28:37.477 --> 28:40.480
So, in the autumn of 1919...

28:40.647 --> 28:44.442
...I boarded the Northern Pacific
for a 3,000-mile trip east...

28:44.651 --> 28:46.528
...to the unknown.

28:50.615 --> 28:54.411
To the son of a Montana minister,
Dartmouth was more than an education.

28:54.619 --> 28:58.873
It was a revelation, exposing me
to a world I'd only guessed at.

29:06.381 --> 29:07.299
As part of my degree...

29:07.507 --> 29:11.761
...I had to enlighten incoming freshmen
on the wonders of the Romantic poets.

29:13.138 --> 29:16.933
And although I was unaware of it then,
teaching fit me.

29:17.851 --> 29:21.062
But most of the time, I sat
in the card room of my fraternity house...

29:21.229 --> 29:24.858
...giving my blue-nosed brothers
a lesson in Front Street poker.

29:27.152 --> 29:29.571
In all, I spent six years at Dartmouth...

29:29.779 --> 29:32.032
...away from home nearly all that time.

29:34.743 --> 29:37.454
On the other hand,
Paul stayed home for college...

29:37.621 --> 29:40.624
...unwilling to leave the fish
he had not yet caught.

29:45.712 --> 29:49.883
After graduation, he took a job
as a reporter for a Helena newspaper...

29:50.050 --> 29:52.135
...and moved to that town...

29:52.844 --> 29:57.015
...his connection with the family
growing as slight as my own.

30:05.732 --> 30:07.901
It was not until the spring of 1926...

30:08.109 --> 30:10.695
...that I finally did come home.

30:55.490 --> 30:58.076
Dinner is in half an hour,
so you have time for a bath.

31:00.161 --> 31:02.122
Do I look thin, Mother?

31:05.959 --> 31:07.877
Do I look old, Norman?

31:10.213 --> 31:12.716
No, you look, uh...

31:13.258 --> 31:17.929
I wish Paul could have been here tonight.
He's working late.

31:22.350 --> 31:23.643
Norman?

31:23.810 --> 31:24.936
Won't you come in?

31:32.569 --> 31:34.613
I'm sorry Paul won't be here.

31:34.779 --> 31:37.198
The life of a newspaperman.

31:37.365 --> 31:41.244
Well, you know how Paul likes to...

31:41.453 --> 31:43.079
I do.

31:43.246 --> 31:44.956
Sit.

31:50.962 --> 31:53.381
I also hear that he...

31:55.550 --> 31:57.636
Well, I hear everything, don't I?

31:57.802 --> 31:59.846
The Lord forbid
my flock keep me in ignorance.

32:03.808 --> 32:06.228
Yes.

32:06.394 --> 32:10.482
You can bet that everyone from here to
Helena knows all about your education.

32:11.566 --> 32:14.319
It is an achievement.

32:14.486 --> 32:17.072
To what use
shall you put this achievement?

32:19.908 --> 32:24.246
Uh... Well, I've been considering
the Forest Service.

32:24.454 --> 32:26.706
As a career?

32:26.873 --> 32:28.500
No...

32:30.877 --> 32:32.921
No, for the summer.

32:34.923 --> 32:36.675
As a break.

32:36.841 --> 32:38.927
Well, that's a good idea.

32:39.970 --> 32:42.806
- The body fuels the mind.
- That's what I was thinking.

32:42.973 --> 32:45.392
And after?

32:45.600 --> 32:47.269
I'm not absolutely sure yet.

32:48.853 --> 32:52.482
Well, you've had six years
to become sure, Norman.

33:02.659 --> 33:05.495
Have you considered
an advanced degree?

33:06.746 --> 33:10.125
- The law? Medicine?
- No.

33:10.292 --> 33:12.877
The ministry?

33:15.005 --> 33:17.424
I've applied for several teaching positions.

33:17.632 --> 33:21.011
- Have you?
- College level, but I haven't heard yet.

33:21.219 --> 33:23.305
No, no, it's early, but...

33:24.890 --> 33:27.309
Now, you have taught classes already,
haven't you?

33:27.976 --> 33:29.269
Yes.

33:29.477 --> 33:32.314
And did you find that experience
rewarding?

33:32.480 --> 33:34.316
That is to say...

33:34.482 --> 33:37.277
...do you feel this could be your calling?

33:37.444 --> 33:39.613
My calling?

33:41.656 --> 33:43.742
Dinner, gentlemen!

33:59.382 --> 34:01.009
Pee in their pants?

34:01.176 --> 34:04.304
If it's so funny, how come I'm not
laughing? Yes, pee in their pants.

34:04.471 --> 34:06.389
I got a better story.

34:06.556 --> 34:08.308
- Paul Maclean?
- In there.

34:08.475 --> 34:11.603
The rules at Anaconda mines say
"No breaks, not even for the john. "

34:11.853 --> 34:14.105
So the poor bastards pee in their pants.

34:14.272 --> 34:16.697
- What about the late, uh...
- George Masterson!

34:16.733 --> 34:19.945
- Oh, I'll take that.
- She's 23 and built like a brick shithouse.

34:20.110 --> 34:22.530
- No, no!
- You take the Anaconda thing...

34:22.697 --> 34:26.326
- I'll interview the grieving widow.
- But I'm the boss, Maclean!

34:26.534 --> 34:28.954
Fine by me, Boss!

34:29.120 --> 34:30.330
Brother!

34:33.416 --> 34:34.626
Look at you!

34:36.543 --> 34:39.672
Boys, this is my big brother,
the professor.

34:39.880 --> 34:41.675
- Gentlemen.
- Hiya!

34:41.841 --> 34:43.592
Come on!

34:44.928 --> 34:46.888
Sit.

34:48.056 --> 34:49.599
Thanks for coming to see me last night

34:49.766 --> 34:52.561
I am sorry about that. I wanted to be there.

34:52.726 --> 34:57.148
I wanted to hear the old man say
"Norman, come into my study, please. "

35:05.156 --> 35:07.158
Jeez, the professor!

35:10.412 --> 35:12.372
We should celebrate!

35:19.379 --> 35:20.297
Yeah!

35:22.048 --> 35:23.967
A little early for me.

35:24.134 --> 35:27.512
Oh! The east is making you soft.

35:29.764 --> 35:31.766
Is that right?

35:47.824 --> 35:49.910
Do much fishing out east?

35:51.411 --> 35:52.787
None.

35:52.954 --> 35:54.706
None?

35:54.873 --> 35:57.626
Well, what do you say? The Big Blackfoot.

36:24.361 --> 36:26.947
- You set?
- Yeah.

36:35.205 --> 36:37.791
- Why don't you take this hole? It's good.
- No, it's all right.

36:37.958 --> 36:40.043
No, it's a good hole.

37:01.147 --> 37:03.650
Too tight. Try a roll-cast.

37:20.542 --> 37:23.503
The fish are out further.

37:24.671 --> 37:26.548
Just a little... further.

37:28.508 --> 37:30.218
Cast your line into the current.

37:30.385 --> 37:33.138
It'll give you better base,
add some distance.

37:33.889 --> 37:36.766
You're just rusty, that's all.

39:35.093 --> 39:37.345
He called it shadow-casting...

39:37.512 --> 39:41.558
...keeping his line above water
long enough, and low enough...

39:41.725 --> 39:44.394
...to make a rainbow rise.

39:45.562 --> 39:48.273
And I realised
that in the time I was away...

39:48.440 --> 39:51.151
...my brother had become an artist.

39:53.194 --> 39:57.699
And one day my coach says "Mac,
how'd you like to meet John L Sullivan?"

39:57.866 --> 39:59.492
John L Sullivan?

39:59.659 --> 40:02.954
Yes, the John L Sullivan, the last
bare-knuckle champion of the world!

40:03.163 --> 40:05.874
It was then I knew I was home.

40:06.041 --> 40:09.502
Standing on the steps
of the Missoula library once again...

40:09.711 --> 40:11.713
...late at night...

40:11.880 --> 40:16.468
...telling stories to the same boys who had
sat there and listened 100 times before.

40:16.635 --> 40:18.637
- Irish or Scot?
- Scot.

40:18.803 --> 40:21.104
And who had, in my absence,
become men.

40:21.139 --> 40:24.768
It just goes to show
the world is full of bastards...

40:24.976 --> 40:29.397
...the number increasing the further
one gets from Missoula, Montana!

40:29.606 --> 40:30.815
Amen!

40:31.024 --> 40:33.985
See, Professor, that's why you need
to stick around here from now on.

40:34.152 --> 40:35.904
Hey, where's the gargle?

40:36.071 --> 40:38.865
Yes, pass this way!

40:39.032 --> 40:41.534
I'll take you to the Fourth of July dance.

40:41.701 --> 40:44.996
Every girl you need to know will be there...
without Momma!

40:45.205 --> 40:46.915
Ooh!

40:47.082 --> 40:49.417
Find you a little Sheba.

40:50.961 --> 40:52.754
Gentlemen, it's been swell...

40:52.921 --> 40:54.381
...but I have to rush.

40:54.547 --> 40:55.548
Where are you going?

40:55.757 --> 40:58.468
- Heavy date, Paul?
- Where you going, Pauley?

40:58.635 --> 41:01.513
- With the poker table!
- They got new signs on the way down.

41:01.680 --> 41:04.432
"Does your husband misbehave?"

41:04.599 --> 41:06.268
"Grunt 'n' grumble, rant and rave?"

41:06.434 --> 41:09.437
"Well, shoot that brute
some Burma-Shave!"

41:12.440 --> 41:14.192
The road to where?

41:14.359 --> 41:17.237
- Lolo.
- Lolo Hot Springs.

41:27.747 --> 41:31.126
Being back in my father's church
seemed to complete my return.

41:31.334 --> 41:32.794
More than anything else...

41:32.961 --> 41:36.506
...I realised it was my father's words
that made me feel most at home.

41:36.673 --> 41:39.009
And in the glow of awakened memories...

41:39.175 --> 41:42.637
...with the deepest feelings
of the heart all a-stir...

41:44.347 --> 41:47.225
...we are reminded of the poet who sings.

41:48.518 --> 41:52.397
"Backward, turn backward
O time in your flight

41:52.564 --> 41:54.566
Make me a child again

41:54.733 --> 41:57.235
Just for tonight. "

41:58.320 --> 42:00.280
# <big band jazz>

42:25.138 --> 42:27.098
# <big band jazz>

42:38.985 --> 42:40.195
Recognise anybody?

42:40.362 --> 42:44.241
- Well, uh...
- Oh, you were gone too long, son!

42:48.245 --> 42:49.788
Who's that?

42:49.955 --> 42:51.957
Who?

42:52.123 --> 42:53.708
There.

42:56.419 --> 42:58.004
Oh, yeah?

43:00.048 --> 43:03.051
A little, uh, infatuation?

43:03.218 --> 43:05.178
Chub, who is that?

43:05.887 --> 43:07.514
Jessie Burns.

43:07.681 --> 43:11.560
From Wolf Creek.
She got a brother went to Hollywood.

43:11.768 --> 43:14.104
Jessie Burns.

43:22.529 --> 43:24.406
Excuse me. Would you like to dance?

43:24.573 --> 43:27.701
Would you be a doll and get us a drink?

43:27.909 --> 43:30.161
Jessie, who's that?

43:52.434 --> 43:53.727
Here you are.

43:58.356 --> 44:02.777
- Here you go.
- Oh, great. Life-saver!

44:02.944 --> 44:06.239
Oops! How ladylike

44:08.533 --> 44:12.662
I'll have to be careful.
I'll wipe off all the powder.

44:12.829 --> 44:16.124
Phantom Of The Opera!

44:21.379 --> 44:23.798
# < she sings along to the music>

44:24.007 --> 44:26.885
# Pack up all my cares and woe

44:27.052 --> 44:29.054
# Here I go, singin' low

44:29.221 --> 44:32.849
# Bye-bye, blackbird...

44:33.892 --> 44:37.854
You know, I heard, uh, Louis Armstrong
sing, this, uh, song once...

44:38.021 --> 44:40.273
...in a little speak
in Greenwich Village, New York.

44:40.440 --> 44:42.275
Really?

44:42.817 --> 44:45.403
Best jazz in the world.
Coloured jazz, you know?

44:45.612 --> 44:47.572
The real McCoy, not like, uh...

44:47.739 --> 44:50.825
...Paul Whiteman
of the Cliquot Club Eskimos.

44:50.992 --> 44:54.079
My mother loves
the Cliquot Club Eskimos.

44:56.831 --> 44:58.792
Does she?

44:59.626 --> 45:04.297
# Blackbird, bye-bye!#

45:16.810 --> 45:17.727
Dance?

45:21.022 --> 45:22.315
Yeah.

45:22.524 --> 45:25.318
Yowsa, yowsa, yowsa!

45:25.485 --> 45:27.153
Let the fireworks begin!

45:29.281 --> 45:30.699
Come on!

45:30.865 --> 45:33.118
Come on, Jessie!

45:33.285 --> 45:34.911
Jessie!

45:45.422 --> 45:47.757
I have a wonderful idea.

45:47.883 --> 45:51.761
What better lesson for those girls
than a trip to the reservation?

45:51.928 --> 45:56.433
To learn a real Christian lesson in giving.
Hm? Don't you think?

45:56.600 --> 45:58.685
I'll organise it. Don't lift a finger.

45:58.894 --> 46:03.732
Ah, thank you, Eva. This is the most
charitable idea I've heard in years.

46:05.275 --> 46:08.278
Do you know those Indian children
don't even have shoes, Norman?

46:08.445 --> 46:10.530
- Mm?
- Are you waiting for the phone?

46:10.739 --> 46:13.617
- No, I don't have to.
- No, you go ahead.

46:13.783 --> 46:18.538
- OK. If you need to use it...
- No, no, no, I have work to do.

46:18.747 --> 46:20.540
OK.

46:30.926 --> 46:33.094
Hello, Mrs Hatcher.

46:36.932 --> 46:39.017
Hello, Mrs Hatcher. I'd like...

46:39.226 --> 46:42.687
Oh, she's fine. I'd like...

46:42.854 --> 46:46.233
Yes, they're fine, everybody's fine.
They're all fine, Mrs Hatcher.

46:46.441 --> 46:49.653
I'd like the Burns residence,
Wolf Creek, please.

46:50.946 --> 46:54.074
Yes, Mrs Hatcher,
I know it's long-distance.

46:55.242 --> 46:57.077
Thank you.

47:00.038 --> 47:01.998
Hello.

47:02.415 --> 47:04.459
Is Jessie there?

47:05.418 --> 47:09.756
Oh, this is Norman Maclean,
but I don't think she...

47:12.217 --> 47:14.010
Hello.

47:17.055 --> 47:20.267
No, I'm the one who brought you the drink.

47:24.145 --> 47:28.108
No, we didn't get a chance.
The fireworks started and...

47:28.358 --> 47:30.151
Well...

47:30.318 --> 47:32.487
We talked about music.

47:34.614 --> 47:39.452
And I said I heard
Louis Armstrong sing the...

47:41.788 --> 47:43.748
Yeah, that's me.

47:44.499 --> 47:46.918
Yeah, I was just a little nervous. Mm?

47:47.127 --> 47:48.878
Well, because...

47:50.714 --> 47:52.757
...you're so je ne sais quoi.

47:57.971 --> 47:59.723
I thought maybe I could come over...

47:59.890 --> 48:02.893
...and listen to the Cliquot Club Eskimos
with your mother.

48:03.935 --> 48:06.688
Yes.

48:10.442 --> 48:13.820
Well, I called
because I wanted to see you again.

48:17.198 --> 48:20.660
Well, um, how about Saturday?

48:22.287 --> 48:24.205
Uh... eight?

48:26.124 --> 48:27.792
OK!

48:30.754 --> 48:32.130
OK.

48:33.131 --> 48:35.300
Then I'll see you then.

48:36.218 --> 48:37.719
Bye.

48:52.609 --> 48:54.069
I could do that again!

48:55.820 --> 48:57.614
Hey, here they are!

49:00.742 --> 49:02.202
Brother!

49:03.286 --> 49:05.372
- Hi.
- Hi.

49:05.538 --> 49:07.874
Jessie, this is my baby brother, Paul.

49:08.041 --> 49:12.087
- And this is Monasetah.
- Mabel.

49:12.963 --> 49:14.172
Hi.

49:15.298 --> 49:16.424
Shall we?

49:22.430 --> 49:24.474
- What do you say, Pauley?
- Hey, Pauley!

49:24.641 --> 49:26.059
Murph!

49:26.226 --> 49:28.186
- Preacher!
- Preacher?

49:28.353 --> 49:29.771
How are you, Murph?

49:29.938 --> 49:31.815
Long time, long time.

49:31.982 --> 49:33.650
Good to see you.

49:33.817 --> 49:38.238
Uh, you know the house rules
as good as I do, Paul.

49:39.406 --> 49:41.992
No Injuns. Period.

49:42.200 --> 49:45.328
I just flat don't like the house rules,
Murph.

49:45.537 --> 49:47.289
Me neither.

49:50.709 --> 49:53.837
Well, what are you gonna
make me do here, Pauley?

49:54.045 --> 49:57.007
Just get us a table, for four.

50:07.434 --> 50:09.686
- Last time, Paul.
- Hello, Judge.

50:09.853 --> 50:11.146
Paul.

50:11.313 --> 50:15.108
Oh, you can get him back.
Get drunk and dance naked on his tables.

50:15.317 --> 50:17.903
And beat hell out of the son of a bitch!

50:18.069 --> 50:19.362
# <Dixie jazz>

50:24.576 --> 50:26.536
- My darling!
- Hi, Paul.

50:30.624 --> 50:34.336
They got some swell hooch here.
They even wash the glasses.

50:48.934 --> 50:50.352
Drink?

50:50.518 --> 50:52.938
What'll it be, Je... Jessie?

50:53.146 --> 50:56.107
Uh, I'll have a martini, Paul. It is Paul?

50:58.235 --> 51:00.987
Righty-ho! The usual for Norm...

51:01.154 --> 51:02.697
...a gin and prune juice.

51:02.864 --> 51:05.116
Make that a double!

51:05.283 --> 51:06.993
Excuse me!

51:07.160 --> 51:09.246
I'd like to order a drink, too.

51:09.454 --> 51:11.456
Whisky... double.

51:17.587 --> 51:20.799
So, uh... what are you doing now, Mabel?

51:21.925 --> 51:23.969
I sell bait.

51:27.514 --> 51:30.183
You know, you have
the most beautiful hair I've ever seen.

51:32.727 --> 51:37.482
- You think I should get it bobbed?
- No, no, not in a million years.

51:44.155 --> 51:46.741
- Well...
- The candle burns at both ends.

51:46.950 --> 51:48.785
It will not last the night.

51:48.952 --> 51:53.540
But, ah, my foes, and oh, my friends,
it gives a lovely light.

51:56.001 --> 51:58.253
That's... nice.

52:12.475 --> 52:16.271
How about "To my editor, the old fa...
the old curmudgeon. " Excuse me.

52:16.438 --> 52:18.690
You know,
he took me off the Anaconda story.

52:18.857 --> 52:20.775
I'm a reporter at the Bee.

52:20.942 --> 52:22.527
- I know.
- How do you know?

52:22.694 --> 52:24.279
Oh, I'm famous.

52:24.446 --> 52:26.072
The Fishing Newspaperman.

52:26.239 --> 52:28.825
- You know he fishes, too?
- I thought everybody knew.

52:29.034 --> 52:31.202
Brother, you've been away a long time.

52:31.411 --> 52:33.121
I'd say so.

52:33.288 --> 52:35.957
- Anyway, it seems my editor...
- The old curmudgeon!

52:36.124 --> 52:40.629
Yes, exactly. Has been getting calls.
No names, just threats.

52:40.837 --> 52:42.464
Real threats?

52:42.631 --> 52:46.176
Well, it's nice to know
you're touching a nerve, but...

52:46.343 --> 52:49.304
- Well, what did they say?
- Mm?

52:49.471 --> 52:51.723
- What did they say?
- Mm?

52:51.890 --> 52:54.976
- What did they say?
- You'll have to cut it out of him.

52:55.143 --> 52:56.811
The usual.

52:56.978 --> 52:59.940
"The boys are gonna have
to come down and pay me a little visit. "

53:00.106 --> 53:02.943
Ah! "Fit you with a pair of
concrete galoshes, see?"

53:03.109 --> 53:04.945
Exactly.

53:06.613 --> 53:08.573
I have to dance.

53:12.911 --> 53:15.330
# < slow jazz>

53:20.585 --> 53:21.878
Hey, hey!

53:23.505 --> 53:24.798
Watch out!

53:25.882 --> 53:27.008
Wow!

53:56.329 --> 53:59.416
And now, the Muskrat Ramble!

53:59.583 --> 54:01.334
# <fast banjo>

54:02.878 --> 54:04.921
Watch it! Hey!

54:05.088 --> 54:07.048
Get out of it!

54:36.703 --> 54:39.998
# < slow dance starts>

54:44.794 --> 54:48.506
I'm nowhere near as good as my brother,
but would you do me the honour?

54:48.715 --> 54:50.717
I'd love to.

55:29.881 --> 55:35.929
<Norman> "Dear Jessie, as the moon
lingers a moment over the Bitterroots...

55:36.137 --> 55:38.390
...before its descent into the invisible...

55:39.349 --> 55:41.601
...my mind is filled with song. "

55:42.435 --> 55:44.854
"I find I am humming softly...

55:45.063 --> 55:47.649
...not to the music, but something else. "

55:49.067 --> 55:51.152
"Someplace else. "

55:52.070 --> 55:54.114
"A place remembered. "

55:54.281 --> 55:57.659
"A field of grass,
where no-one seemed to have been...

55:57.826 --> 55:59.619
...except the deer. "

55:59.786 --> 56:02.998
"The memory is strengthened
by the feeling of you...

56:03.164 --> 56:05.917
...dancing in my awkward arms. "

56:06.251 --> 56:08.169
"Norman. "

56:23.810 --> 56:25.395
Yes?

56:27.022 --> 56:29.065
- What's wrong?
- Who is it?

56:30.609 --> 56:33.445
It's OK, Mother! Who is this?

56:47.334 --> 56:50.962
I'm, uh, Norman Maclean.

56:51.171 --> 56:54.049
Ah, he doesn't have to post bond.

56:54.216 --> 56:56.384
He covers the police beat
and has friends here.

56:56.551 --> 56:58.803
All you have to do is look at him
and take him home.

56:59.763 --> 57:01.723
What did he do?

57:01.890 --> 57:05.602
He hit a guy
and a guy is missing a couple of teeth.

57:05.769 --> 57:06.728
Why did he hit him?

57:08.772 --> 57:10.941
It says here a remark was passed...

57:11.107 --> 57:13.944
...concerning
the Indian woman he was with.

57:14.110 --> 57:16.071
Well, the guy deserved it.

57:17.989 --> 57:20.158
You're picking your brother up too much
lately.

57:23.411 --> 57:25.455
Is that right?

57:25.622 --> 57:28.333
Besides, he's behind
in the big stud poker game at Lolo.

57:28.500 --> 57:31.711
It's not healthy to get behind
in that big game at Lolo.

57:34.923 --> 57:38.051
- Is he hurt?
- He's not hurt, he's just sick.

57:38.218 --> 57:40.470
He drinks too much.

57:40.679 --> 57:43.807
Down at Lolo, they don't drink too much.

57:49.938 --> 57:52.649
You better go in and get your brother.

58:27.475 --> 58:30.854
# I'm tired and I wanna go to jail

58:31.938 --> 58:35.567
# I just had a drink about an hour ago

58:36.484 --> 58:38.820
# It went right through my head

58:39.821 --> 58:42.157
# No matter where I go...

58:43.491 --> 58:45.994
# On land, or sea, or foam

58:46.161 --> 58:50.415
# You can always hear me
singing this song

58:51.249 --> 58:54.252
# Show me the way to go home#

59:50.559 --> 59:55.230
If you need any money, Paul,
or anything else...

59:55.480 --> 59:59.359
...I want you to know that...
- She lives past the slaughterhouse.

01:00:04.030 --> 01:00:06.032
I can help.

01:00:09.494 --> 01:00:11.454
Turn here.

01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:25.969
# <fiddle and banjo play jaunty tune>

01:00:38.982 --> 01:00:41.151
Come here, Queenie, come here!

01:00:44.571 --> 01:00:46.406
I got it! Whoo, whoo, whoo!

01:01:06.843 --> 01:01:08.720
Look at that! Ha!

01:01:08.887 --> 01:01:13.058
Well, the chickens haven't
come home to roost yet, Al.

01:01:19.522 --> 01:01:21.066
Not bad.

01:01:23.526 --> 01:01:26.321
- Are you all right, Norman?
- Clara.

01:01:26.488 --> 01:01:29.282
- Was that your jelly?
- Yes, it was, Ethel.

01:01:29.449 --> 01:01:30.367
- It's wonderful.
- Thank you so much.

01:01:30.575 --> 01:01:32.744
- And is this Norman?
- Yes, it is.

01:01:32.953 --> 01:01:34.996
Yes, we're very proud of him.

01:01:35.163 --> 01:01:37.582
- Nice to have you back.
- Thank you.

01:01:37.791 --> 01:01:40.544
Her daughter has turned
into quite a beauty.

01:01:40.710 --> 01:01:43.588
And there she is over there.
Twenty only a week ago.

01:01:43.755 --> 01:01:45.590
She's bright as a light, Norman.

01:01:46.883 --> 01:01:47.801
Mother...

01:01:48.009 --> 01:01:50.679
Mr Murchison! How are you?

01:01:52.305 --> 01:01:54.182
How are you?

01:01:54.349 --> 01:01:57.352
- How are you?
- Oh, quite well, thank you.

01:01:57.519 --> 01:01:59.312
Good, good.

01:01:59.479 --> 01:02:01.565
And this is Paul?

01:02:01.731 --> 01:02:03.525
No, this is Norman.

01:02:03.692 --> 01:02:06.987
- Norman.
- Oh, Norman!

01:02:07.195 --> 01:02:10.907
- You're looking good.
- Yes, hasn't he grown up?

01:02:11.074 --> 01:02:15.412
- You're looking so good.
- Oh, Paul's here. Come on!

01:02:16.121 --> 01:02:19.499
I'm sorry, Mother. I have to meet
Jessie Burns' family at the station.

01:02:19.708 --> 01:02:21.084
Her brother Neal's coming from California.

01:02:21.251 --> 01:02:23.169
Oh, well now.

01:02:23.336 --> 01:02:26.631
- So I'm late.
- Should we have this girl over to dinner?

01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:29.009
Perhaps, Mother.

01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:45.442
- Hello!
- Howdy!

01:02:45.609 --> 01:02:46.610
Mother!

01:02:54.367 --> 01:02:56.328
- Paul!
- Well, well...

01:02:56.494 --> 01:02:57.996
Hey, Maclean!

01:02:58.163 --> 01:02:59.205
- Paul.
- Maclean.

01:02:59.414 --> 01:03:02.209
- Let me borrow those a moment.
- Sure, why not?

01:03:02.294 --> 01:03:03.254
Hello, Father.

01:03:03.462 --> 01:03:07.007
Come here, come here!

01:03:23.774 --> 01:03:25.860
- Yes, you are!
- No!

01:03:26.861 --> 01:03:29.989
The Burns family ran a general store
in a one-store town...

01:03:30.156 --> 01:03:32.867
...and still managed to do badly.

01:03:34.410 --> 01:03:35.703
This is Norman.

01:03:35.870 --> 01:03:37.163
They were Methodists...

01:03:37.371 --> 01:03:41.500
...a denomination my father always
referred to as "Baptists who could read".

01:03:41.667 --> 01:03:45.129
- Glad to know you. It's a pleasure.
- This is my mother.

01:03:45.296 --> 01:03:48.215
It's a pleasure to meet you, Norman.
Jessie tells me you're a poet.

01:03:48.382 --> 01:03:50.217
Are you related
to the Fishing Newspaperman?

01:03:50.384 --> 01:03:51.761
That's my brother.

01:03:51.927 --> 01:03:54.513
- Jessie says you just got your degree.
- Yes.

01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:57.016
Jessie was at the university.
She was majoring in...

01:03:57.224 --> 01:03:58.142
Flapperism.

01:03:58.350 --> 01:04:01.353
Wasn't it?

01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:04.607
- She dropped out.
- Aunt Sally!

01:04:04.774 --> 01:04:06.859
She can learn from you. Stick-to-activity.

01:04:07.026 --> 01:04:09.695
Oh, now, just let the young man breathe.

01:04:09.862 --> 01:04:11.947
He's not used to all this.
He's a Presbyterian.

01:04:15.159 --> 01:04:18.245
Ooh, he's here! He's here!

01:04:34.887 --> 01:04:37.223
Jessie's brother Neal
stepped off the train...

01:04:37.431 --> 01:04:40.017
...trying to remember what
a Davis Cup tennis player looked like.

01:04:40.184 --> 01:04:43.813
- You look so good!
- He looks a little thin!

01:04:43.979 --> 01:04:47.274
You look great! You look great!

01:04:47.441 --> 01:04:50.277
Neal, this is Norman.
Norman, my brother Neal.

01:04:50.444 --> 01:04:52.863
Hello, boy.

01:04:53.030 --> 01:04:55.366
What, did you sit up all night
on that thing?

01:04:55.574 --> 01:04:57.743
Did you get my card from Yellowstone?

01:04:57.952 --> 01:04:59.829
- I did. I got that.
- What do you think about this tie?

01:04:59.995 --> 01:05:02.790
Come on, guys. Let him breathe.
He just got here.

01:05:02.957 --> 01:05:05.042
- Let's go eat.
- That's a good idea!

01:05:05.251 --> 01:05:07.253
I got some chicken salad sandwiches
in the car...

01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:09.922
...and I've got some baking chickens
at home.

01:05:10.131 --> 01:05:13.259
Mrs Miller has given us some cherries
so I can make your favourite pie.

01:05:13.426 --> 01:05:16.345
Mrs Miller's still alive?

01:05:18.222 --> 01:05:20.141
Not the home-made beer!

01:05:20.307 --> 01:05:22.393
It was a good year!

01:05:22.893 --> 01:05:27.648
Over the lips, past the gums,
look out stomach, here she comes!

01:05:29.358 --> 01:05:31.318
So what's the first station out there now?

01:05:31.485 --> 01:05:35.364
When I travelled that way,
San Berdoo was there.

01:05:35.573 --> 01:05:39.118
San Berdoo and a lot of sand,
and a lot of desert...

01:05:39.326 --> 01:05:40.995
...a hell of a lot of desert.

01:05:41.162 --> 01:05:43.497
We came back to Salt Lake City...

01:05:43.664 --> 01:05:46.667
...and had to change at Salt Lake City.

01:05:46.834 --> 01:05:49.545
There was a little hotel there
that used to...

01:05:49.712 --> 01:05:53.007
- Serve oysters.
- ... serve oysters.

01:05:53.174 --> 01:05:57.053
- Norman, do you drink? Does he drink?
- Oh, a little bit.

01:05:57.261 --> 01:06:00.056
Well, here's to the old fam-damn-ily!

01:06:00.222 --> 01:06:02.141
Fam-damn-ily!

01:06:02.308 --> 01:06:04.560
- Hear, hear!
- Fam-damn-ily.

01:06:07.063 --> 01:06:10.191
He's just tired. It's a long trip.

01:06:10.357 --> 01:06:13.360
At least he still has his appetite!

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:23.037
So how long you planning to stay, Neal?

01:06:24.914 --> 01:06:26.832
Sport! Sport, come here!

01:06:28.626 --> 01:06:32.004
I don't know. I miss the ocean.

01:06:32.213 --> 01:06:34.006
What's it like?

01:06:34.173 --> 01:06:37.218
Oh, it's big and it's blue.
People ride on the waves.

01:06:37.385 --> 01:06:40.596
I tell you, I was getting pretty good at it!
Ow!

01:06:40.805 --> 01:06:43.224
Down, man! Bad dog, bad!

01:06:43.391 --> 01:06:47.645
- Jeez, Ma!
- Well, you get him so excited!

01:06:47.853 --> 01:06:49.146
Sport!

01:06:49.355 --> 01:06:52.316
Anyhoo, what was I...
What was I talking about?

01:06:52.483 --> 01:06:53.776
- The water.
- The ocean.

01:06:53.943 --> 01:06:55.736
Oh, yeah. Yes, yes, yes.

01:06:55.903 --> 01:06:57.947
So we'd ride those waves all day long,
all the boys...

01:06:58.114 --> 01:07:00.533
...Ramon, me, Ronnie Coleman.

01:07:00.741 --> 01:07:02.284
Ronald Coleman?!

01:07:02.451 --> 01:07:05.746
- Ronald Coleman?
- I love Ronald Coleman.

01:07:05.955 --> 01:07:09.500
You know, people have told me
I look like Ronald Coleman.

01:07:09.709 --> 01:07:14.380
- Yeah.
- I can't picture him riding on waves.

01:07:20.594 --> 01:07:22.763
Some Kodak, huh?

01:07:23.889 --> 01:07:26.475
Well, Ma...

01:07:26.684 --> 01:07:28.436
...it's been a long trip.

01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:35.651
Maybe you could go fishing
with Norman sometime?

01:07:36.819 --> 01:07:39.488
- Hm?
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

01:07:43.284 --> 01:07:44.326
Yeah.

01:07:44.535 --> 01:07:46.787
Wonderful. Wouldn't it be?

01:07:46.954 --> 01:07:48.164
Fishing?

01:07:48.330 --> 01:07:49.999
Well, you do fish?

01:07:50.166 --> 01:07:53.377
Course he does!
He has a pole and everything.

01:07:53.544 --> 01:07:54.754
Oh, yes, everybody does.

01:07:54.962 --> 01:07:56.630
You betcha!

01:07:56.797 --> 01:08:00.593
- When's a good time for you, Norman?
- Oh, uh, Friday?

01:08:00.801 --> 01:08:01.844
Friday's good.

01:08:02.053 --> 01:08:04.555
- Friday's good.
- What time?

01:08:05.681 --> 01:08:07.058
Six?

01:08:07.224 --> 01:08:08.642
AM?

01:08:12.063 --> 01:08:15.608
Oh, yes. He'll be there. Won't you, honey?

01:08:15.775 --> 01:08:18.569
Thank you, Norman,
that's very kind of you.

01:08:18.736 --> 01:08:19.653
Oh, my pleasure.

01:08:19.862 --> 01:08:21.654
And... and maybe Paul could come, too?

01:08:21.822 --> 01:08:24.241
Oh, that would be nice.

01:08:24.408 --> 01:08:27.328
I'm sure Paul would love
to go fishing with us.

01:08:27.495 --> 01:08:31.665
- Can I come?
- Oh, no, not this time, honey.

01:08:31.874 --> 01:08:37.046
Let's get these things outside.

01:08:44.595 --> 01:08:47.430
Why don't you go with Neal, Norman?

01:08:47.598 --> 01:08:49.265
So you can make your plans.

01:08:50.350 --> 01:08:52.310
Oh... yeah.

01:08:56.982 --> 01:09:00.861
The only plan Neal had in mind
was a trip to Black Jack's Bar...

01:09:01.028 --> 01:09:03.823
...which was simply an old freight car
set in the woods...

01:09:03.988 --> 01:09:06.242
...where any honest policeman
would be unlikely to find it.

01:09:07.868 --> 01:09:10.871
So, it was this otter and her pups.

01:09:11.037 --> 01:09:15.376
Now, I had a hell of a time tracking 'em,
because they turn white in the winter.

01:09:15.584 --> 01:09:19.546
After a few shots of the especially vile
whisky brewed by Black Jack himself...

01:09:19.714 --> 01:09:21.799
...Neal began to hold forth.

01:09:22.006 --> 01:09:26.595
He'd chosen Montana subjects to spin
his lies about shooting, hiking, trapping...

01:09:26.804 --> 01:09:29.932
...probably, I figure, to impress
the only other client at the bar...

01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:32.643
...a ploy that was beginning to pay off.

01:09:32.810 --> 01:09:37.398
Anyhoo, she tried to lose me
again and again...

01:09:37.564 --> 01:09:39.984
She went by the name of Old Rawhide.

01:09:40.192 --> 01:09:44.238
About ten years before, she'd been
elected beauty queen of Wolf Creek.

01:09:44.404 --> 01:09:48.908
She had ridden bareback standing up
through the 100 inhabitants, mostly male.

01:09:49.118 --> 01:09:53.622
Her skirts flew high,
and she won the contest.

01:09:53.831 --> 01:09:57.960
I couldn't feel my hands! I'm thinking
about my dog, Sport, that's with me.

01:09:58.127 --> 01:10:00.171
I'm thinking "If it gets any colder...

01:10:00.337 --> 01:10:03.966
...I just may have to slit him open and stick
my hands in to keep 'em from freezing. "

01:10:04.133 --> 01:10:06.177
It would have been a tough thing to do.

01:10:06.343 --> 01:10:09.889
But I... Well, I did it before,
up at the Yukon.

01:10:10.056 --> 01:10:12.224
God knows, I love that damn dog.

01:10:12.433 --> 01:10:15.227
She still wore the divided skirts
of a horsewoman...

01:10:15.394 --> 01:10:17.980
...although they must have been
a hardship in her new profession.

01:10:18.147 --> 01:10:20.733
And there, on a branch...

01:10:20.941 --> 01:10:22.902
...waiting to jump on the first deer...

01:10:23.069 --> 01:10:26.697
...is the goddamn otter!

01:10:26.906 --> 01:10:28.949
Hey, buster...

01:10:29.116 --> 01:10:32.745
...what's an otter doing
on the top of Rogers Pass?

01:10:32.912 --> 01:10:35.873
I thought they swam down in the cricks.

01:10:38.209 --> 01:10:41.420
Jack, why don't you bring this lady
a whisky?

01:10:41.587 --> 01:10:43.631
Well, I gotta shove off.

01:10:45.758 --> 01:10:47.927
Don't forget, old boy. Friday, fishing.

01:10:49.303 --> 01:10:50.596
What?

01:11:18.999 --> 01:11:20.376
What say?

01:11:20.543 --> 01:11:22.545
They said I'd find you at your other office.

01:11:22.712 --> 01:11:25.798
Yeah. Deadline. I can't work there.

01:11:29.176 --> 01:11:30.553
You come for a drink?

01:11:32.388 --> 01:11:34.432
Um... a favour.

01:11:40.813 --> 01:11:42.773
Go fishing with me?

01:11:44.775 --> 01:11:48.237
Sure.

01:11:49.655 --> 01:11:55.202
Well, that's marvy, because Jessie's got
a brother in from California, and, um...

01:11:56.454 --> 01:11:59.331
I'm not gonna lie to you:
He's a world champion peckerwood.

01:11:59.498 --> 01:12:02.084
- Bait fisherman?
- He didn't say.

01:12:02.293 --> 01:12:04.628
Good Lord! George!

01:12:04.837 --> 01:12:07.715
He's going to show up
with a coffee can full of worms.

01:12:07.882 --> 01:12:10.468
Red can. Hills Brothers. I'd lay a bet on it.

01:12:12.178 --> 01:12:14.430
I promised Jessie.

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:20.061
Are you getting serious?

01:12:20.227 --> 01:12:21.353
What?

01:12:21.562 --> 01:12:25.733
You son of a bitch, you're getting
serious. You and Jessie. Huh?

01:12:28.319 --> 01:12:31.405
- Well?
- I don't know.

01:12:35.868 --> 01:12:37.870
Then I guess we ought to do it.

01:13:04.855 --> 01:13:07.900
Whoa! Whoa!

01:13:09.485 --> 01:13:10.861
Hi.

01:13:14.073 --> 01:13:16.242
As I live and breathe.

01:13:16.409 --> 01:13:18.494
Buster here wants to fish.

01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:28.713
You're late, Neal.

01:13:30.464 --> 01:13:33.050
Yeah, I, uh, didn't get in till late.

01:13:33.217 --> 01:13:36.345
Well, I didn't get in at all, but I was here.

01:13:36.554 --> 01:13:38.514
Neal, Paul. Paul, Neal.

01:13:38.681 --> 01:13:41.976
Neal, in Montana there are three things
we're never late for:

01:13:42.184 --> 01:13:44.687
...church, work, and fishing.

01:13:44.895 --> 01:13:46.188
Righty-ho.

01:13:46.981 --> 01:13:49.150
Anyhoo, this is...

01:13:49.358 --> 01:13:51.110
We've met.

01:13:55.239 --> 01:13:57.199
Don't go away.

01:14:08.002 --> 01:14:11.380
Watch the first step - it's a lulu.

01:14:20.473 --> 01:14:24.018
- So...
- You ready to... Neal?

01:14:26.187 --> 01:14:28.230
- Neal!
- What?

01:14:28.397 --> 01:14:30.232
Fishing.

01:14:36.530 --> 01:14:39.366
Buster wants to fish.

01:14:45.581 --> 01:14:47.666
Oh, Neal? What about the bait?

01:14:49.085 --> 01:14:51.796
Dumb Dora!

01:15:04.809 --> 01:15:08.020
We're not gonna catch anything, anyway.
It's too damn hot.

01:15:08.229 --> 01:15:10.564
May he get three doses of clap.

01:15:11.065 --> 01:15:13.651
Sure glad I didn't go home
and get some sleep!

01:15:18.614 --> 01:15:20.699
Where is he?

01:15:23.619 --> 01:15:25.287
God!

01:15:28.916 --> 01:15:31.252
We'll catch up.

01:15:31.419 --> 01:15:33.045
Yeah.

01:16:03.409 --> 01:16:05.327
I know, you've got twenty.

01:16:15.337 --> 01:16:17.048
Couldn't you find him?

01:16:17.214 --> 01:16:21.719
- To hell with him.
- I thought we were supposed to help him.

01:16:21.886 --> 01:16:24.472
How the hell do you help
that son of a bitch?

01:16:27.099 --> 01:16:29.060
By taking him fishing.

01:16:29.226 --> 01:16:32.063
He doesn't like fishing.

01:16:32.229 --> 01:16:34.732
He doesn't like Montana,
and he sure as hell doesn't like me!

01:16:36.942 --> 01:16:41.947
Well, maybe what he likes
is somebody trying to help him.

01:16:57.797 --> 01:16:59.799
You... You sank the beer, yeah?

01:16:59.965 --> 01:17:01.926
You bet your life.

01:17:03.260 --> 01:17:05.679
Yeah.

01:17:05.846 --> 01:17:07.932
OK, let's go!

01:17:15.272 --> 01:17:17.608
Oh, jeez! I can taste it!

01:17:23.406 --> 01:17:26.242
Shall we kill him?

01:17:32.373 --> 01:17:34.709
Damn it!

01:17:34.917 --> 01:17:37.086
Holy Christ!

01:17:50.599 --> 01:17:52.685
This is not good.

01:17:52.852 --> 01:17:56.147
Well, she's got a tattoo.

01:17:56.313 --> 01:17:58.357
Well.

01:17:58.524 --> 01:18:00.943
- Initials?
- No.

01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:03.028
Love.

01:18:10.578 --> 01:18:12.663
I can get in myself.

01:18:18.419 --> 01:18:21.547
Hey, you got anything to drink, buster?

01:18:21.714 --> 01:18:23.966
Uh, Buster's the one with the red ass.

01:18:36.437 --> 01:18:38.397
I'm in deep trouble.

01:18:38.564 --> 01:18:41.567
Yeah. You want me
to come over and protect you?

01:18:41.734 --> 01:18:43.986
I'm sure Mrs Burns
would love to meet the girlfriend.

01:18:44.153 --> 01:18:46.238
I ain't burned!

01:18:46.447 --> 01:18:48.616
The sun don't bother me!

01:18:50.326 --> 01:18:52.411
Yeah.

01:18:52.620 --> 01:18:56.791
What do you think about me spending
the night with you and the folks?

01:18:56.999 --> 01:19:00.127
We'll come back here tomorrow,
wipe this day off the books.

01:19:00.336 --> 01:19:02.129
It's a deal.

01:19:02.296 --> 01:19:06.092
Come on, buster! I'm as dry as dirt.

01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:08.219
Hark, fair Juliet speaks.

01:19:12.098 --> 01:19:14.767
Good luck!

01:19:31.784 --> 01:19:33.411
Ow!

01:19:33.577 --> 01:19:35.496
Ow! Aagh!

01:19:38.416 --> 01:19:41.335
Sweet Jesus!

01:19:41.502 --> 01:19:43.921
What have you done to my boy?

01:19:44.130 --> 01:19:46.716
Don't... Aagh!

01:19:46.882 --> 01:19:49.385
- What...?
- He fell asleep in the sun.

01:19:54.181 --> 01:19:57.643
Oh, my Lord in heaven! It's all right.

01:19:57.852 --> 01:19:59.812
It's all right, we'll fix it.

01:19:59.979 --> 01:20:01.981
We'll fix it.

01:20:08.279 --> 01:20:10.072
You left him alone, Norman?

01:20:10.239 --> 01:20:12.408
He was... He brought someone...

01:20:12.575 --> 01:20:14.410
...and, uh...

01:20:14.577 --> 01:20:16.620
I think you better go home.

01:20:34.930 --> 01:20:36.724
I need a ride home.

01:21:04.543 --> 01:21:06.879
You better hang on!

01:21:07.046 --> 01:21:08.422
What are you do...?

01:21:34.490 --> 01:21:36.826
I don't think you, uh...

01:21:37.034 --> 01:21:41.205
They send trains down here all the time,
you know, without a schedule.

01:21:42.581 --> 01:21:44.834
You're not, uh...

01:21:47.253 --> 01:21:49.213
I don't think
they can see us in here.

01:22:59.617 --> 01:23:02.119
Well, thanks for the flight.

01:23:06.082 --> 01:23:08.042
You know, you're funny.

01:23:08.209 --> 01:23:10.628
Oh? How am I funny?

01:23:12.046 --> 01:23:15.341
You, uh...
You don't like my brother, do you?

01:23:20.221 --> 01:23:22.640
No, I do not like your brother.

01:23:26.477 --> 01:23:28.813
Look, I don't know any card tricks, Jess...

01:23:28.979 --> 01:23:30.940
...but I like you.

01:23:31.273 --> 01:23:33.526
And I wanna see you again.

01:23:41.409 --> 01:23:43.744
Hey!

01:23:43.953 --> 01:23:47.498
- Hello, Jess.
- Hey, Paul.

01:23:47.707 --> 01:23:51.585
- How's your brother?
- You, uh... You both left him alone.

01:23:51.752 --> 01:23:54.171
Well, I'm sorry about that.
That was my fault.

01:23:54.338 --> 01:23:56.674
Well, you're not forgiven.

01:23:57.216 --> 01:23:59.385
Was Norman forgiven?

01:23:59.552 --> 01:24:02.054
Norman's not funny.

01:24:05.224 --> 01:24:08.018
Whoo!

01:24:17.278 --> 01:24:19.780
And I hung fresh towels
on the washstand for you.

01:24:20.531 --> 01:24:22.324
Won't you remember
to powder my toothbrush, Mother?

01:24:22.450 --> 01:24:23.993
Oh!

01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:26.912
Now let Paul tell his latest story.

01:24:27.079 --> 01:24:30.207
Oh, yes, which one?
The murder, the wreck or the fire?

01:24:30.374 --> 01:24:33.127
I think they should put you
on church beat.

01:24:33.294 --> 01:24:35.087
I agree, I agree.

01:24:35.254 --> 01:24:39.300
Quote: "The Reverend Maclean had quite
a nice roast while dining with his family. "

01:24:39.467 --> 01:24:42.511
"All except for the poor elder son...

01:24:42.678 --> 01:24:44.680
...enjoyed it immensely. "

01:24:45.514 --> 01:24:48.100
- Norman, what's the matter?
- He's not funny.

01:24:48.309 --> 01:24:50.811
- Pardon me?
- He's not funny.

01:24:52.897 --> 01:24:56.609
Uh, well, there are more important
accomplishments, Norman.

01:24:56.817 --> 01:24:58.486
Mm-hm. It's all right if you're dull, Norman.

01:24:58.652 --> 01:25:00.821
No!

01:25:01.030 --> 01:25:02.865
We're very proud of you.

01:25:03.991 --> 01:25:06.577
Well, I do have one story.

01:25:06.786 --> 01:25:07.995
No murder, no mayhem.

01:25:08.162 --> 01:25:11.290
I interviewed the President.

01:25:13.918 --> 01:25:15.961
- Calvin Coolidge?
- The President?

01:25:16.128 --> 01:25:18.631
Mr Coolidge?

01:25:18.839 --> 01:25:19.965
- When?
- A few days ago.

01:25:20.174 --> 01:25:21.884
He was in Dakota... fly-fishing.

01:25:22.051 --> 01:25:23.886
Fly-fishing!

01:25:24.053 --> 01:25:27.098
Fly-fishing in a suit and tie,
white gloves and patent leather shoes.

01:25:27.264 --> 01:25:30.643
So I asked him. I went right up to him.

01:25:30.810 --> 01:25:34.438
I said "Excuse me, sir,
can you tell me what they're biting on?"

01:25:34.605 --> 01:25:37.316
He turns around, looks at me,
and says "The end of my line. "

01:25:37.483 --> 01:25:40.069
- What?
- The end of my line.

01:25:42.613 --> 01:25:45.032
Then a bunch of the locals
came running over...

01:25:45.199 --> 01:25:47.952
...tied on some new-fangled fly
the size of a chicken.

01:25:48.119 --> 01:25:50.204
Old Cal, he heaves it out there.

01:25:50.413 --> 01:25:53.874
Figured if he can't catch a trout,
by God, he's gonna scare one to death.

01:25:57.712 --> 01:25:59.255
Did you get a picture?

01:25:59.422 --> 01:26:01.465
Oh, yeah. It'll be in the Sunday paper.

01:26:01.632 --> 01:26:03.884
"Closed Mouth Cal
Communes With The Croppies. "

01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:09.348
Ugh!

01:26:13.102 --> 01:26:15.062
Mother, that was amazing.

01:26:15.229 --> 01:26:17.732
Yeah, he usually only eats
what he can hit on the road.

01:26:17.898 --> 01:26:19.984
That was funny.

01:26:20.151 --> 01:26:24.321
- You know, I do worry about you, Paul.
- I think I'm gonna run over and...

01:26:24.530 --> 01:26:27.825
- What?
- What?

01:26:29.744 --> 01:26:33.039
Oh, I was just gonna say...

01:26:33.247 --> 01:26:37.418
...I thought I'd go out and meet some
of the old pals, being in town and all.

01:26:41.297 --> 01:26:45.468
Don't you wait up. I'm planning on eating
the rest of this when nobody's looking.

01:27:16.707 --> 01:27:20.961
I understand he's changed
the spelling of our name.

01:27:22.213 --> 01:27:24.715
"MacLean", with a capital L.

01:27:25.716 --> 01:27:29.512
Now everyone will think
we're Lowland Scots.

01:27:45.820 --> 01:27:47.113
Howdy, Norman.

01:27:49.490 --> 01:27:51.450
Hi, there, Mr Sweeney.

01:27:51.617 --> 01:27:55.246
Who do you know
at the University of Chicago?

01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:00.960
Chicken in the car. The car won't go.

01:28:01.127 --> 01:28:04.088
That's how you spell "Chi-ca-go"!

01:28:16.559 --> 01:28:22.356
"Hath elsewhere
it's setting, and cometh from afar:

01:28:22.565 --> 01:28:26.902
Not in entire forgetfulness,
And not in utter nakedness,

01:28:27.069 --> 01:28:31.824
But trailing clouds of glory do we come

01:28:31.991 --> 01:28:33.200
From God, who is our home. "

01:28:33.367 --> 01:28:36.454
Nothing can bring back
the hour of splendour in the grass

01:28:36.620 --> 01:28:39.623
Of glory in the flower;
We will grieve not

01:28:39.790 --> 01:28:43.919
Rather find strength
in what remains behind;

01:28:44.086 --> 01:28:47.631
In the primal sympathy
Which having been must ever be;

01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:50.885
In the soothing thoughts
that spring out of human suffering;

01:28:51.052 --> 01:28:53.763
In the faith that looks through death

01:28:53.929 --> 01:28:57.475
Thanks to the human heart
by which we live

01:28:57.683 --> 01:29:01.145
Thanks to its tenderness,
its joys, its fears.

01:29:02.605 --> 01:29:05.983
To me, the meanest flower that blows

01:29:06.150 --> 01:29:11.530
Can give thoughts
that do often lie too deep for tears.

01:29:16.702 --> 01:29:19.372
Good luck, Son. We'll be rooting for you.

01:29:19.455 --> 01:29:20.456
There's sandwiches in here for you.

01:29:20.664 --> 01:29:24.293
It was one week ex actly
before I spoke to Jessie again.

01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:27.463
She called to tell me
that Neal was going back to California...

01:29:27.630 --> 01:29:30.049
...and that he would appreciate me
seeing him off.

01:29:30.216 --> 01:29:32.301
We love you, we love you. Good luck.

01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:38.265
Though I was surprised by the invitation,
I asked only one question of Jessie.

01:29:38.474 --> 01:29:41.477
Did she want me to come?
And she answered yes.

01:29:41.644 --> 01:29:44.397
I love you. Don't forget to write!

01:30:24.812 --> 01:30:28.190
If he came back next summer,
would you try and help him?

01:30:28.399 --> 01:30:30.735
If he wanted me to, I would try.

01:30:31.235 --> 01:30:35.364
- Well, he's not coming back.
- At least he's got friends out there.

01:30:35.531 --> 01:30:38.242
Who, Ronald Coleman?

01:30:47.918 --> 01:30:51.881
Why is it
the people who need the most help...

01:30:52.089 --> 01:30:53.549
...won't take it?

01:30:55.843 --> 01:30:57.887
I don't know, Jess.

01:31:03.392 --> 01:31:05.436
God.

01:31:05.603 --> 01:31:07.271
I don't...

01:31:07.438 --> 01:31:09.523
I don't cry, Norman.

01:31:25.331 --> 01:31:27.124
Can I show you something?

01:31:28.334 --> 01:31:30.836
Only if it's something good.

01:31:35.925 --> 01:31:37.593
Read.

01:31:47.728 --> 01:31:52.900
- So, what do you think?
- What do I think? I think it's the berries!

01:31:53.109 --> 01:31:56.654
- You do?
- Yeah. To get away... Chicago...

01:31:56.862 --> 01:31:57.697
God, it's heaven!

01:31:57.905 --> 01:32:00.783
- Have you ever been?
- No, not anywhere.

01:32:00.950 --> 01:32:03.202
Helena!

01:32:03.411 --> 01:32:07.206
God, congratulations, Norman!

01:32:09.875 --> 01:32:12.211
The truth is, I'm not sure I wanna leave.

01:32:12.378 --> 01:32:17.049
Montana, why? It'll always be here.

01:32:17.216 --> 01:32:20.302
- Not Montana.
- Then what?

01:32:22.012 --> 01:32:23.431
What?

01:32:25.307 --> 01:32:27.143
I'm not sure I wanna leave you.

01:32:52.084 --> 01:32:54.670
What do they know? I've just come
from there. I'm having my liquid lunch.

01:32:54.879 --> 01:32:57.381
Watch it, Fred.
I'm telling you, they're after you.

01:32:57.548 --> 01:32:58.591
You're all right if you're out of work.

01:33:01.260 --> 01:33:02.219
Well, now.

01:33:07.016 --> 01:33:09.268
Give us a couple of boilermakers, friend.

01:33:14.982 --> 01:33:16.734
Two up.

01:33:24.492 --> 01:33:25.951
Well...

01:33:26.118 --> 01:33:27.787
Here's to the heart, goddamn it.

01:33:27.953 --> 01:33:29.914
Oh, Lordy!

01:33:48.015 --> 01:33:50.434
I'm in love with Jessie Burns.

01:33:53.479 --> 01:33:55.564
Jesus Christ, Norm.

01:33:55.773 --> 01:33:57.441
With all the fish in the river.

01:33:57.608 --> 01:33:59.527
Well, not like her.

01:33:59.693 --> 01:34:01.696
Oh, right.

01:34:02.738 --> 01:34:04.907
Not like her.

01:34:07.451 --> 01:34:09.537
Congratulations.

01:34:10.579 --> 01:34:12.832
I'm real happy for ya.

01:34:15.710 --> 01:34:19.004
Well, goddamn it,
let's get the hell out of here and celebrate.

01:34:19.171 --> 01:34:20.881
Done.

01:34:22.091 --> 01:34:23.801
#... Bananas today

01:34:24.260 --> 01:34:25.886
# We've got home-grown potatoes

01:34:26.053 --> 01:34:27.471
# And vine-ripened tomatoes... #

01:34:27.638 --> 01:34:29.140
- It's a stinker.
- What?

01:34:29.974 --> 01:34:31.684
It stinks.

01:34:31.851 --> 01:34:34.520
What do you mean?
This is gonna be... It's a classic.

01:34:34.687 --> 01:34:35.896
Oh, really?

01:34:39.734 --> 01:34:42.945
# Yes, we have no bananas

01:34:43.112 --> 01:34:46.824
# We have no bananas today#

01:34:48.993 --> 01:34:53.039
Where are we? Where are we going?

01:34:58.711 --> 01:35:00.671
- Lolo.
- Yep.

01:35:12.099 --> 01:35:16.771
I figured you felt lucky tonight.
I could use some of the luck.

01:35:24.028 --> 01:35:26.364
Jesus Christ! No, don't.

01:35:26.530 --> 01:35:29.033
Don't be the professor tonight.

01:35:29.909 --> 01:35:31.535
Norm...

01:35:31.702 --> 01:35:32.995
Preacher?

01:36:19.667 --> 01:36:21.210
Hello, Frank.

01:36:21.377 --> 01:36:25.005
Well, my gal Sal.

01:36:52.491 --> 01:36:54.660
Sal? Hey, Sal!

01:36:56.370 --> 01:36:59.832
- Get a drink for my brother.
- Bourbon.

01:37:00.875 --> 01:37:03.461
In fact, how about a round on me?

01:37:04.587 --> 01:37:06.547
He's in love.

01:37:16.515 --> 01:37:17.558
Hang on.

01:37:19.351 --> 01:37:21.312
Take care of him, Sal.

01:37:29.153 --> 01:37:31.405
Not a good idea, Paul.

01:37:34.617 --> 01:37:37.203
Fellas? Got a chair for me?

01:37:37.370 --> 01:37:39.622
- Not for you, Paul.
- Aw, come on, you know I'm good for it.

01:37:44.877 --> 01:37:47.838
- What do you want?
- What?

01:37:49.298 --> 01:37:51.550
Cards? What?

01:37:51.717 --> 01:37:54.053
Beat it.

01:37:54.261 --> 01:37:55.888
What do you want?

01:37:57.556 --> 01:37:58.182
Nothing.

01:38:00.434 --> 01:38:03.437
A buck.
I know Paul says he's paying, but...

01:38:03.604 --> 01:38:04.814
OK!

01:38:07.274 --> 01:38:09.235
OK, OK, OK.

01:38:10.319 --> 01:38:13.531
No, no... Just... games.

01:38:14.448 --> 01:38:15.408
Only games.

01:38:15.616 --> 01:38:17.493
Let's go. Now.

01:38:19.370 --> 01:38:21.539
Come on, we're getting outta here.

01:38:21.747 --> 01:38:23.749
Righty-oh-ho-ho.

01:38:30.297 --> 01:38:31.924
Bye-bye, sonny.

01:38:45.438 --> 01:38:48.315
- I'm not leaving.
- What?

01:38:49.608 --> 01:38:52.194
These hands are hot, Norm. I can feel it.

01:38:52.403 --> 01:38:54.572
What are you talking about?
You can't go back in there!

01:38:55.614 --> 01:38:58.034
Norm, it's fine. I'll be fine.

01:38:58.242 --> 01:39:02.121
- But they won't even let you play!
- Oh, yes, they will.

01:39:02.329 --> 01:39:05.708
With what? You're in debt
up to your goddamn neck!

01:39:05.916 --> 01:39:08.335
Norm, it's my debt.

01:39:10.337 --> 01:39:12.673
OK? It's my debt.

01:39:15.926 --> 01:39:17.887
Jesus Christ!

01:39:38.074 --> 01:39:39.492
Norm!

01:39:40.034 --> 01:39:41.327
Norm!

01:39:41.827 --> 01:39:44.413
Norm.

01:39:45.164 --> 01:39:47.208
Hey.

01:39:47.375 --> 01:39:50.419
I was thinking.
We never got to go fishing again.

01:39:50.586 --> 01:39:54.048
Maybe we can go tomorrow.
We could get Dad to come along.

01:39:55.466 --> 01:39:56.842
OK?

01:39:58.052 --> 01:39:59.887
You ask him.

01:40:02.515 --> 01:40:03.808
OK.

01:40:06.102 --> 01:40:07.603
6.30.

01:41:00.031 --> 01:41:03.909
Boy, something smells good out there!
Morning, everybody. Morning!

01:41:04.118 --> 01:41:06.370
- Want some muffins?
- Perfect.

01:41:06.537 --> 01:41:09.749
I'm so glad you could make it,
with work and everything.

01:41:09.957 --> 01:41:11.500
I wouldn't miss it.

01:41:11.667 --> 01:41:13.919
What are you working on?
Do you have any new stories to tell us?

01:41:14.128 --> 01:41:17.089
A story? Hm... All righty.

01:41:18.799 --> 01:41:20.760
Oh, jeez.

01:41:22.803 --> 01:41:24.180
I have one.

01:41:26.932 --> 01:41:28.559
What?

01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:32.521
I've been offered a job
at the University of Chicago.

01:41:33.981 --> 01:41:35.191
Yes?

01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:37.860
Teaching literature.

01:41:38.652 --> 01:41:40.154
What?

01:41:40.321 --> 01:41:42.573
Starting fall term.

01:41:46.118 --> 01:41:48.204
I'm gonna take it.

01:41:50.164 --> 01:41:51.040
Norman!

01:41:57.004 --> 01:41:58.798
I am pleased.

01:42:00.591 --> 01:42:03.511
Yes, I am pleased.

01:42:05.763 --> 01:42:07.056
Well...

01:42:08.015 --> 01:42:09.892
A professor?

01:42:13.437 --> 01:42:15.398
A real professor.

01:42:16.190 --> 01:42:17.942
Damnation!

01:42:21.904 --> 01:42:23.864
I'm proud of you.

01:42:37.586 --> 01:42:39.755
Now, you be sure to take pictures.

01:42:43.134 --> 01:42:46.512
- We're gonna get some big fish.
- Yes, we are! Let's go!

01:42:57.148 --> 01:43:01.318
Remember those rocks we used to go to?

01:43:01.527 --> 01:43:04.989
- Those were mean rocks.
- Yeah, nearly a billion years old.

01:43:05.197 --> 01:43:07.241
Half a billion.

01:43:07.408 --> 01:43:08.951
Come on!

01:43:12.455 --> 01:43:14.123
Well...

01:43:14.957 --> 01:43:18.252
...I, uh, believe
the high road will suit me better.

01:43:20.004 --> 01:43:21.922
Oh!

01:43:25.593 --> 01:43:27.136
There was a time...

01:43:27.303 --> 01:43:29.638
You'll make a killing!

01:43:33.768 --> 01:43:35.728
He'll make a killing.

01:43:37.313 --> 01:43:40.232
- Let's fish together today.
- Good.

01:45:41.854 --> 01:45:44.357
- What are they biting on?
- What?

01:45:46.233 --> 01:45:49.278
- What are they biting on?
- Louder!

01:45:51.197 --> 01:45:54.033
I said...

01:45:54.575 --> 01:45:56.327
Bunyan Bugs!

01:46:00.623 --> 01:46:02.958
Want me to bring you one?

01:46:03.125 --> 01:46:05.378
No! I'll come and get it.

01:46:20.059 --> 01:46:22.395
Bunyan Bug stonefly number two.

01:46:22.603 --> 01:46:26.232
Thank you, O merciful professor
of poetry and trout.

01:46:54.427 --> 01:46:57.346
I'm going to ask Jessie to marry me.

01:46:59.765 --> 01:47:01.183
Yes.

01:47:03.686 --> 01:47:05.771
Quite a day.

01:47:15.281 --> 01:47:17.366
Why don't you come with us to Chicago?

01:47:23.956 --> 01:47:28.294
It's 2,000 miles away. They got
more than a dozen papers there.

01:47:28.461 --> 01:47:31.589
You'd be right in the middle of things.

01:47:32.923 --> 01:47:34.341
What do you say?

01:47:35.968 --> 01:47:37.595
Come with us.

01:47:41.057 --> 01:47:43.642
Oh, I'll never leave Montana, Brother.

01:49:34.253 --> 01:49:36.172
There!

01:51:06.345 --> 01:51:08.222
Oh me, oh my!

01:51:08.389 --> 01:51:10.641
Look at that fish!

01:51:15.354 --> 01:51:17.314
Unbelievable.

01:51:18.607 --> 01:51:22.319
At that moment, I knew,
surely and clearly...

01:51:22.486 --> 01:51:24.363
...that I was witnessing perfection.

01:51:26.907 --> 01:51:30.536
You... You are a fine fisherman.

01:51:30.703 --> 01:51:33.998
Only need three more years
before I can think like a fish.

01:51:34.165 --> 01:51:37.543
You're already thinking
like a dead stonefly. Picture.

01:51:37.752 --> 01:51:39.128
Mother's pictures.

01:51:39.295 --> 01:51:40.504
- Hurry up.
- One.

01:51:43.049 --> 01:51:44.550
Two.

01:51:44.717 --> 01:51:48.012
My brother stood before us,
not on a bank of the Big Blackfoot River...

01:51:48.179 --> 01:51:50.431
...but suspended above the earth...

01:51:50.598 --> 01:51:54.226
...free from all its laws, like a work of art.

01:51:54.393 --> 01:51:56.645
Three!

01:52:10.242 --> 01:52:13.245
And I knew just as surely
and just as clearly...

01:52:13.412 --> 01:52:15.498
...that life is not a work of art...

01:52:16.374 --> 01:52:19.251
...and that the moment could not last.

01:52:34.558 --> 01:52:36.977
And so when the police sergeant
awakened me one morning...

01:52:37.186 --> 01:52:39.105
...just before Jessie and I
left for Chicago...

01:52:39.271 --> 01:52:41.524
...I rose and asked no questions.

01:53:12.263 --> 01:53:15.891
He drove me back home,
down the length of the river...

01:53:16.100 --> 01:53:18.269
...so that I could tell
my father and mother...

01:53:18.477 --> 01:53:20.730
...that Paul had been beaten to death
by the butt of a revolver...

01:53:20.938 --> 01:53:23.357
...and his body dumped in an alley.

01:54:06.192 --> 01:54:09.070
Is there anything else you can tell me?

01:54:13.908 --> 01:54:17.036
Nearly all the bones in his hand
were broken.

01:54:36.097 --> 01:54:38.099
Which hand?

01:54:40.684 --> 01:54:42.687
His right hand.

01:55:17.346 --> 01:55:20.474
As time passed, my father struggled
for more to hold on to...

01:55:20.683 --> 01:55:24.645
...asking me again and again,
had I told him everything?

01:55:24.812 --> 01:55:27.148
And finally, I said to him...

01:55:27.356 --> 01:55:29.859
..."Maybe all I really know about Paul...

01:55:30.026 --> 01:55:32.278
...is that he was a fine fisherman. "

01:55:32.486 --> 01:55:35.865
"You know more than that,"
my father said.

01:55:36.073 --> 01:55:37.658
"He was beautiful. "

01:55:39.118 --> 01:55:43.372
And that was the last time
we ever spoke of my brother's death.

01:55:54.050 --> 01:55:57.261
Indirectly, though, Paul was always
present in my father's thoughts.

01:55:57.470 --> 01:56:02.475
I remember the last sermon I heard him
give, not long before his own death.

01:56:03.392 --> 01:56:05.269
Each one of us here today...

01:56:05.436 --> 01:56:08.314
...will at one time in our lives...

01:56:08.481 --> 01:56:13.152
...look upon a loved one in need
and ask the same question.

01:56:14.111 --> 01:56:18.699
"We are willing to help, Lord,
but what, if anything, is needed?"

01:56:20.826 --> 01:56:24.121
For it is true
we can seldom help those closest to us.

01:56:24.288 --> 01:56:27.583
Either we don't know
what part of ourselves to give...

01:56:27.750 --> 01:56:31.879
...or, more often than not,
the part we have to give...

01:56:32.046 --> 01:56:34.215
...is not wanted.

01:56:34.965 --> 01:56:38.010
And so it is those we live with
and should know...

01:56:38.177 --> 01:56:40.262
...who elude us.

01:56:42.431 --> 01:56:44.683
But we can still love them.

01:56:45.267 --> 01:56:47.520
We can love completely...

01:56:47.728 --> 01:56:50.940
...without complete understanding.

01:57:29.854 --> 01:57:34.942
Now, nearly all those I loved and did not
understand in my youth are dead...

01:57:35.109 --> 01:57:37.069
...even Jessie.

01:57:37.236 --> 01:57:39.321
But I still reach out to them.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:54.128
Of course, now I'm too old
to be much of a fisherman.

01:57:54.628 --> 01:57:57.631
And now I usually fish
the big waters alone...

01:57:57.798 --> 01:58:00.301
...although some friends think I shouldn't.

01:58:08.309 --> 01:58:12.021
But when I am alone
in the half-light of the canyon...

01:58:12.229 --> 01:58:16.567
...all existence seems to fade
to a being with my soul and memories...

01:58:17.234 --> 01:58:21.655
...and the sounds of the Big Blackfoot
River and a four-count rhythm...

01:58:21.822 --> 01:58:24.325
...and the hope that a fish will rise.

01:58:37.546 --> 01:58:40.758
Eventually, all things merge into one...

01:58:43.928 --> 01:58:46.514
...and a river runs through it.

01:58:52.561 --> 01:58:55.564
The river was cut
by the world's great flood...

01:58:55.731 --> 01:58:59.276
...and runs over rocks
from the basement of time.

01:58:59.985 --> 01:59:03.531
And some of the rocks
are timeless raindrops.

01:59:04.198 --> 01:59:06.450
Under the rocks are the words...

01:59:07.368 --> 01:59:09.870
...and some of the words are theirs.

01:59:19.547 --> 01:59:21.716
I am haunted by waters.
