Ar-Lord Super-Awesome
Adventure Log.

00:03.038 --> 00:05.705
My quest for the Cosmic Seed,

00:05.741 --> 00:08.709
a thingy with so much power that every
bad guy in the universe wants it,

00:08.744 --> 00:11.712
had led me and the Guardians
of the Galaxy to Spartax,

00:11.747 --> 00:14.915
which also happens to be
my dad's home planet.

00:14.950 --> 00:17.818
I thought it was a dead end until
I learned my father, J'Son,

00:17.853 --> 00:20.021
stole the Cosmic Seed
from Asgard years ago.

00:20.055 --> 00:23.090
I showed the evidence to Thor,
but he didn't take it very well.

00:23.125 --> 00:26.060
Turns out, the war was all a
setup by Thor's brother, Loki,

00:26.094 --> 00:27.928
who wanted to get his big bro
out of the way

00:27.963 --> 00:30.765
so he could rule Asgard himself.

00:30.799 --> 00:32.732
Well, we tricked him
and revealed the truth,

00:32.768 --> 00:35.736
and also exposed J'Son as a
traitor to his own people.

00:35.771 --> 00:38.806
I hate to say it, but my father's,
like, 99 percent a jerk,

00:38.840 --> 00:42.043
'cause dear old Dad had one
more trick up his sleeve.

00:45.047 --> 00:47.882
You made a deal with Thanos?

00:47.916 --> 00:50.051
I did what I must, Peter.

00:50.085 --> 00:52.053
I required an ally
to protect my people

00:52.087 --> 00:54.855
from the treachery
of Loki and Asgard.

00:54.890 --> 00:57.010
Well, maybe they'd have been
a little less treacherous

00:57.025 --> 01:00.895
if you hadn't stolen the Cosmic
Seed from them in the first place!

01:00.929 --> 01:03.764
You are a fool, Son-of-J.

01:03.799 --> 01:07.735
Even my brother, Loki, knows better
than to trust the Mad Titan.

01:07.769 --> 01:10.805
Uh, hi. Uh, yeah, I hate to
break up the blame game,

01:10.839 --> 01:12.840
but we got incoming!

01:12.874 --> 01:16.911
Hmm, it appears the chaos
has only just begun.

01:16.945 --> 01:19.780
Well played, J'Son.

01:32.611 --> 01:35.613
You know, Dad, I made some
really dumb mistakes in my life,

01:35.647 --> 01:37.848
but even I
wouldn't trust Thanos.

01:37.883 --> 01:40.718
This is how empires are made.

01:40.752 --> 01:43.621
Hear me, Spartax.

01:43.655 --> 01:46.624
The shadow of Thanos
darkens your world.

01:46.658 --> 01:50.628
Submit to my will or perish.

01:50.662 --> 01:52.863
As a wise Earth man once said,

01:52.898 --> 01:55.900
"Up your nose
with a rubber hose."

01:56.935 --> 01:58.769
Begone, Thanos,

01:58.804 --> 02:01.505
or this day will see your ruin,

02:01.540 --> 02:04.842
and this world shall become your tomb!
Hazzah!

02:06.611 --> 02:08.679
Come get some of this!

02:14.753 --> 02:16.887
I am Groot!

02:18.857 --> 02:20.691
Angela, Hogun, Heimdall,

02:20.725 --> 02:24.528
let us show these invaders
the true might of Asgard!

02:29.701 --> 02:32.703
Destroyer Armor,
clear the skies!

02:41.646 --> 02:42.780
Not again.

02:42.814 --> 02:45.583
As much as I'm enjoying this,

02:45.617 --> 02:47.718
I will take my leave.

03:10.876 --> 03:14.528
Face me, children of Asgard.

03:14.563 --> 03:15.863
Angela, Heimdall,

03:15.897 --> 03:17.698
let us show the Mad Titan

03:17.732 --> 03:19.733
the might of Asgard.

03:40.922 --> 03:43.691
Leave my world, Thanos!

03:46.695 --> 03:48.729
You first.

03:48.763 --> 03:50.898
No one blasts my baby sis.

03:50.932 --> 03:52.766
The Guardians of the Galaxy.

03:52.801 --> 03:56.604
Surely you did not think
you saw the last of Thanos.

03:56.638 --> 03:58.539
Teleporting me across the stars

03:58.573 --> 04:00.474
only delayed the inevitable...

04:00.508 --> 04:01.775
your doom.

04:01.810 --> 04:04.712
It delayed only my vengeance.

04:04.746 --> 04:07.681
Thanos will pay for
the destruction of my family!

04:07.716 --> 04:11.752
Not before he pays
for the destruction of my life!

04:11.786 --> 04:14.655
Pulverize that cosmic creep!

04:27.736 --> 04:30.638
That's right.
It's a face full of hot lava!

04:30.672 --> 04:32.606
Feel the burn!

04:36.678 --> 04:40.781
This is your end, Star-Lord.

04:40.815 --> 04:43.617
Lord Thanos, no.
You must spare him.

04:45.620 --> 04:47.621
And why should I?

04:47.656 --> 04:49.757
Because even though my dad
is a thief and a traitor,

04:49.791 --> 04:51.859
he still cares about
his only son?

04:51.893 --> 04:54.795
Because if you still want
the Cosmic Seed,

04:54.829 --> 04:57.665
my son is the only person
who can find it.

04:57.699 --> 05:01.602
You are so not getting
a Father's Day present. Uh-oh.

05:01.636 --> 05:06.573
Then let us find
the Cosmic Seed together.

05:06.608 --> 05:09.677
Wait. Aren't you going
to destroy Asgard?

05:09.711 --> 05:10.844
What about our deal?

05:10.879 --> 05:13.647
The deal was for
the Cosmic Seed.

05:13.682 --> 05:17.584
Only once I have it
will I destroy Asgard,

05:17.619 --> 05:19.820
along with everything else.

05:22.624 --> 05:24.792
Uh, question.
By "everything else,"

05:24.826 --> 05:26.794
do you mean you're gonna
destroy the whole galaxy?

05:27.829 --> 05:29.663
Why stop there?

05:37.539 --> 05:38.806
Well, what are we waitin' for?

05:38.840 --> 05:41.542
<i>Let's fire up the Milano
and go get Quill.</i>

05:41.576 --> 05:43.844
And have my revenge.

05:43.878 --> 05:46.814
The son of Son-of-J
is an honorable man.

05:46.848 --> 05:48.582
I will accompany you,

05:48.616 --> 05:50.884
as will Angela
and the Destroyer Armor.

05:50.919 --> 05:54.588
Heimdall, Hogun, Fandral,
return to Asgard.

05:54.622 --> 05:57.691
We must safeguard the realm
from my brother's treachery.

05:57.726 --> 05:59.626
You must take me with you.

05:59.661 --> 06:02.796
I will save Peter,
or die trying. Aah!

06:02.831 --> 06:06.633
The only place you're going,
Father, is a prison cell!

06:06.668 --> 06:09.636
You allied yourself with Thanos.

06:09.671 --> 06:12.673
Be thankful it is not I
who will decide your fate.

06:12.707 --> 06:15.576
The galaxy's a big place.

06:15.610 --> 06:16.810
Thanos could be headed anywhere.

06:16.845 --> 06:19.646
You want to find him,
you need me.

06:19.681 --> 06:20.647
Keep talking.

06:20.682 --> 06:22.516
I communicate with Thanos

06:22.550 --> 06:25.486
with a device
that's coded to my DNA.

06:25.520 --> 06:26.754
You can use it to track him,

06:26.788 --> 06:29.490
but only if
you take me with you.

06:33.728 --> 06:35.763
Whoa!

06:35.797 --> 06:37.664
I am Groot.

06:37.699 --> 06:39.800
Better not try anything.

06:39.834 --> 06:42.703
Or, by Gorath's bones,
you will suffer

06:42.737 --> 06:45.539
as few in the universe have.

06:54.649 --> 06:55.849
Ugh!

06:55.884 --> 06:58.652
I thought my son's ship
looked bad,

06:58.686 --> 07:00.487
but how can you stand the smell?

07:00.522 --> 07:02.623
Get used to flying coach,
J-Boy,

07:02.657 --> 07:04.758
'cause you ain't
the king no more.

07:04.793 --> 07:06.627
Focus on your work, rodent.

07:06.661 --> 07:08.662
And you ain't the boss
of me neither.

07:08.696 --> 07:10.697
Bad enough I got
the faceless tin can of death

07:10.732 --> 07:12.733
starin' over my shoulder.

07:12.767 --> 07:15.769
Can you not fly
this craft any faster, Gamora?

07:15.804 --> 07:17.638
My vengeance will not wait.

07:17.672 --> 07:20.641
If you wanna take down Thanos,
better get in line.

07:20.675 --> 07:22.995
Where is this line? I will fight
my way to the front of it.

07:24.546 --> 07:25.746
Okay, I wired the communicator

07:25.780 --> 07:27.481
to the navigation system.

07:27.515 --> 07:29.550
Once His Majesty activates it,

07:29.584 --> 07:31.552
we'll have Thanos's location.

07:33.822 --> 07:35.656
Do it.
Believe it or not,

07:35.690 --> 07:37.825
I want to find Peter
as much as you do.

07:37.859 --> 07:41.628
And... we have contact.

07:46.534 --> 07:48.735
Where is the Cosmic Seed?

07:48.770 --> 07:50.637
Tell me, Spartaxian.

07:50.672 --> 07:53.774
Uh, first of all,
I'm half-Spartaxian.

07:53.808 --> 07:57.578
And second of all,
you didn't say the magic word.

07:57.612 --> 08:00.781
What is this magic word?

08:00.815 --> 08:02.716
"Please."

08:04.519 --> 08:06.653
Look, I don't know
where the Seed is.

08:06.688 --> 08:08.789
I can prove it
if you give me my Boom Box.

08:08.823 --> 08:10.824
Your Boom Box?

08:10.859 --> 08:15.529
The Spartaxian CryptoCube, if you
wanna be all literal about it.

08:19.701 --> 08:21.635
Show me.

08:25.707 --> 08:27.608
The Boom Box can detect
traces of energy

08:27.642 --> 08:30.577
the Cosmic Seed left behind
when my father stole it.

08:30.612 --> 08:32.746
But it turns out
I followed his trail in reverse,

08:32.780 --> 08:34.548
and it led me to Spartax.

08:34.582 --> 08:35.816
So I don't know where it is.

08:37.585 --> 08:39.852
I believe you, Star-Lord,

08:39.888 --> 08:43.524
but that does not mean
you are of no use to me.

08:43.558 --> 08:44.838
You will remain my prisoner

08:44.859 --> 08:48.662
while we find a way for you
to locate the Cosmic Seed.

08:48.696 --> 08:51.765
Now open the CryptoCube for me.

08:51.799 --> 08:56.637
And let you power up with all that
leftover Cosmic Seed energy inside?

08:56.671 --> 08:59.540
Forget it.

09:00.808 --> 09:03.544
I'll die before I open
the Boom Box for you.

09:05.647 --> 09:09.783
Then perhaps it's time
I tried something else.

09:14.722 --> 09:17.457
<i>â™ª</i>

09:22.330 --> 09:23.297
Peter?

09:26.467 --> 09:27.467
Mom?

09:28.503 --> 09:30.370
Oh, Peter,

09:30.405 --> 09:33.340
you act like you
haven't seen me in a week.

09:34.442 --> 09:37.344
I haven't seen you in years.

09:37.378 --> 09:39.546
At least, it seems like years.

09:39.581 --> 09:41.381
I had the strangest dream.

09:41.416 --> 09:44.384
I... I was a space pirate
on a starship,

09:44.419 --> 09:45.652
with a butt-kicking
ninja lady,

09:45.687 --> 09:49.456
a maniac, a talking raccoon,
and a tree-thing guy.

09:49.490 --> 09:51.558
Such an imagination.

09:51.593 --> 09:55.329
You see too many movies,
my little Star-Lord.

09:55.363 --> 09:57.464
That's what everyone was
calling me in the dream...

09:57.498 --> 09:59.333
Star-Lord.

09:59.367 --> 10:01.435
Morning, Ms. Quill.
Breakfast.

10:05.573 --> 10:08.375
DÃ©jÃ  vu.
You guys look so familiar.

10:08.409 --> 10:10.611
That's 'cause I've been looking after
your ma since she got here, kid.

10:10.645 --> 10:12.512
But the big guy's new.

10:12.547 --> 10:14.481
I am Knute. Ha.

10:16.584 --> 10:19.353
You know, Mom, I also dreamed
I met my father.

10:19.387 --> 10:21.355
Ugh, what was name?
Was J-something...

10:21.389 --> 10:23.657
Jacob? J.J.? Jackson?

10:23.691 --> 10:25.492
Jason.

10:25.526 --> 10:27.361
You remind me of him.

10:27.395 --> 10:29.515
Well, don't take this
the wrong way,

10:29.530 --> 10:31.698
but in my dream,
Dad was kind of a jerk.

10:31.733 --> 10:35.369
<i>The Himalayas are home to
the tallest mountains on Earth.</i>

10:35.403 --> 10:38.639
<i>Sometimes... How are we
feeling today, Meredith?</i>

10:38.673 --> 10:40.474
What?

10:40.508 --> 10:41.742
Wait. You guys were
in my dream too.

10:41.776 --> 10:43.577
This is so weird.

10:43.611 --> 10:46.480
I'm feeling much better
today, Doctor.

10:46.514 --> 10:49.549
Maybe well enough
to go home with Peter.

10:49.584 --> 10:51.718
Peter, what's wrong?

10:51.753 --> 10:55.522
It's just that
in my dream, you...

10:55.556 --> 10:56.723
you didn't make it.

10:56.758 --> 10:59.426
Everything's going to be okay,

10:59.494 --> 11:00.594
my little Star-Lord.

11:00.628 --> 11:02.696
I have a gift for you.

11:05.600 --> 11:08.402
Looks so familiar.
What is it?

11:08.436 --> 11:10.504
It's a surprise.

11:10.538 --> 11:11.605
Open it.

11:13.608 --> 11:16.643
I... I don't think
I'm supposed to.

11:16.678 --> 11:18.612
This might be my last chance

11:18.646 --> 11:21.548
to watch you open
a gift from me.

11:24.719 --> 11:27.587
No, this can't be real.

11:27.655 --> 11:30.590
Please. It'll mean
so much to me.

11:34.495 --> 11:35.662
Thanos.

11:35.697 --> 11:38.365
I was captured by Thanos.

11:38.399 --> 11:40.367
This must all be an illusion.

11:40.401 --> 11:42.502
Doctor, we are losing her.

11:42.537 --> 11:45.439
The only thing that can save her
is inside that Cube.

11:45.473 --> 11:46.673
You must open it.

11:49.410 --> 11:51.712
No. No, I can't lose
you again!

12:00.354 --> 12:03.523
You! You used my own
memories against me!

12:03.558 --> 12:07.394
You know, I've done some dirty tricks in
my time, but that was seriously evil!

12:10.398 --> 12:13.667
There is no good or evil,

12:13.701 --> 12:18.338
there is only the will
of Thanos!

12:20.408 --> 12:21.688
<i>According to
my comm link signal,</i>

12:21.709 --> 12:23.677
<i>we should be closing in
on Thanos's location.</i>

12:23.711 --> 12:26.346
Heads up. Sentry ship!

12:27.715 --> 12:30.383
I'll jam
its transmission signals

12:30.418 --> 12:32.352
so it can't warn the main fleet.

12:32.386 --> 12:34.521
No, let Thanos find us.

12:34.555 --> 12:36.656
I shall exact my revenge
that much sooner.

12:36.691 --> 12:39.726
Except my revenge
calls for a sneak attack.

12:39.761 --> 12:42.629
Bah! Where is
the glory in that?

12:42.663 --> 12:44.364
I am Groot.

12:45.533 --> 12:47.367
You ain't kiddin', bud.

12:47.401 --> 12:49.603
Thanos must have a million
fighter ships out there.

12:49.637 --> 12:51.371
Engaging cloaking field.

12:54.742 --> 12:58.411
I do not care
for this sneaking around.

12:58.446 --> 12:59.613
'Tis the coward's way!

12:59.680 --> 13:01.348
Shh! Shh! I am Groot.

13:01.382 --> 13:04.351
Why fret?
They cannot hear us.

13:04.385 --> 13:05.519
But they can see us.

13:07.388 --> 13:09.689
Eh! King Jerkface
sabotaged the cloak!

13:09.724 --> 13:11.658
I am Groot!

13:20.401 --> 13:22.602
Battle stations!
Rocket, take over!

13:22.637 --> 13:24.404
Give us some cover, Goldilocks.

13:24.438 --> 13:27.641
Destroyer Armor, with me!

13:51.732 --> 13:55.468
Now, that's what I call a boom!

13:55.503 --> 13:58.471
Ah. Your friends are loyal,

13:58.506 --> 14:01.675
but they will perish by my hand.

14:11.419 --> 14:12.652
No!

14:15.473 --> 14:18.441
This is but a taste
of the power I will have

14:18.476 --> 14:23.146
once the Cosmic Seed itself
is mine.

14:25.183 --> 14:28.151
Not even Mjolnir
can fend off Thanos's attack.

14:28.186 --> 14:30.287
All that matters
is my vengeance!

14:30.321 --> 14:32.289
Together this time, Drax.

14:32.323 --> 14:33.490
Very well, Gamora.

14:33.524 --> 14:36.459
Together I shall destroy Thanos.

14:36.494 --> 14:39.329
Little unclear
on concept of together.

14:46.504 --> 14:48.405
I am Groot!
I am Groot!

14:48.439 --> 14:50.473
Yeah, I see Quill too.
Good eye, buddy.

14:50.508 --> 14:53.510
Now, let's hope the helmet heads
can keep the fleet off our tail.

15:09.293 --> 15:11.294
I am Groot!

15:16.167 --> 15:18.335
Thanks, pal.

15:18.369 --> 15:20.270
Hey, everybody,
Thanos has my Boom Box,

15:20.304 --> 15:22.305
and it's feeding him
Cosmic Seed energy.

15:22.340 --> 15:24.207
<i>So let's get it and close it up!</i>

15:25.309 --> 15:28.144
I am Groot!

15:38.422 --> 15:39.389
Hmm.

15:50.534 --> 15:53.203
Now face your destroyer, Thanos.

15:53.237 --> 15:58.341
And the weapon forged
by your own hand, Father!

15:58.376 --> 15:59.409
Together!

16:01.245 --> 16:03.413
Enough!

16:06.150 --> 16:08.418
This is the dawn of a new age...

16:08.452 --> 16:12.122
the age of Thanos!

16:15.493 --> 16:17.460
I got him, Quill.
Make your move.

16:20.164 --> 16:21.298
Gotcha!

16:23.234 --> 16:24.267
Huh?

16:33.411 --> 16:36.146
There's only one way
to stop Thanos for good...

16:36.180 --> 16:37.414
destroy the Boom Box.

16:37.448 --> 16:41.217
Uh, don't we need it
to find the Cosmic Seed?

16:41.252 --> 16:44.154
Without the Boom Box,
nobody can find the Seed.

16:44.188 --> 16:45.522
That's what's best
for the galaxy.

16:45.556 --> 16:48.525
Thor, need you to smash the Cube
with that big hammer of yours.

16:48.559 --> 16:51.461
On my way, Lord-of-the-Stars.

16:51.495 --> 16:54.164
Give me the CryptoCube.

16:54.198 --> 16:55.332
Ah...

16:55.366 --> 16:57.233
No, don't think so.
Keep away!

16:57.268 --> 16:59.469
Thor, strike true!

17:03.307 --> 17:05.308
Lord Thanos, I have it!

17:06.410 --> 17:08.345
Not for long.

17:10.146 --> 17:12.248
Give me the Cube, Dad!

17:12.282 --> 17:14.317
You don't understand, Peter.

17:14.352 --> 17:16.453
With the power
of the Cosmic Seed,

17:16.487 --> 17:18.421
we can rule the universe!

17:18.455 --> 17:20.357
You don't understand, Dad.

17:20.391 --> 17:24.461
When Thanos is done, there'll
be no universe left to rule!

17:24.494 --> 17:28.263
Is that electromagnet supposed to
make me let go of the CryptoCube?

17:28.299 --> 17:30.467
No. It's supposed
to get me inside the pod.

17:30.501 --> 17:32.502
This will make you let go
of the CryptoCube.

17:42.246 --> 17:46.249
Freezing this device
will not destroy it, Star-Lord.

17:46.283 --> 17:48.351
No, but it'll make it
really brittle

17:48.386 --> 17:50.520
in those big mitts
of yours, Thanos.

17:50.554 --> 17:51.521
Oops.

18:07.204 --> 18:09.305
I will destroy you all

18:09.340 --> 18:12.108
for daring to deny me my prize!

18:17.248 --> 18:19.182
Uh, Quill,

18:19.216 --> 18:21.336
that black hole's
gonna swallow all of us!

18:27.425 --> 18:30.427
This is for threatening my home!

18:33.264 --> 18:35.365
Asgardian worm!

18:36.534 --> 18:39.436
This is for my mom.

18:44.341 --> 18:47.377
Noooo!

19:00.424 --> 19:03.460
<i>J'Son of Spartax,
we have you surrounded.</i>

19:03.494 --> 19:07.464
Surrender and face
Spartaxian justice, Father.

19:11.168 --> 19:13.136
Explain yourself, Loki.

19:13.170 --> 19:14.304
Why did you return?

19:14.338 --> 19:16.306
Well, I couldn't very well

19:16.340 --> 19:19.242
risk Thanos finding the
Cosmic Seed now, could I?

19:19.276 --> 19:21.311
Enough riddles, brother.

19:21.345 --> 19:24.113
Tell me where
the Cosmic Seed lies.

19:24.148 --> 19:26.416
Oh, I'm afraid I can't do that.

19:26.450 --> 19:29.285
You will tell me. Now!

19:31.155 --> 19:32.455
What I mean, dear brother,

19:32.490 --> 19:35.492
is that I literally
am unable to do so.

19:35.526 --> 19:40.396
You see, after I stole the Cosmic
Seed back from J'Son of Spartax,

19:40.431 --> 19:45.268
I used my trickster's powers to hide
it where no one else could find it,

19:45.302 --> 19:47.403
including me.

19:47.438 --> 19:50.273
Why would you do such a thing?

19:50.307 --> 19:53.476
Well, the Seed clearly
wasn't safe in Asgard.

19:53.511 --> 19:56.479
I did the galaxy
a public service.

19:56.514 --> 19:59.349
I'm a hero.

19:59.383 --> 20:01.317
I beg to differ.

20:01.352 --> 20:04.153
And yet, neither
are you villain.

20:04.188 --> 20:06.523
So you are free to go...
for now.

20:09.426 --> 20:12.161
By leading the defeat of Thanos

20:12.196 --> 20:15.431
and exposing the treachery
of our father, J'Son,

20:15.466 --> 20:18.401
your heroic actions have proven

20:18.435 --> 20:22.205
that you are worthy
to rule the Spartax Empire

20:22.239 --> 20:25.208
as King Peter Quill.

20:27.244 --> 20:29.178
I accept, of course.

20:29.213 --> 20:33.249
But Spartax is your home,
not mine.

20:33.284 --> 20:35.351
The throne belongs to Victoria,

20:35.386 --> 20:37.420
Captain of the Royal Guard,

20:37.454 --> 20:39.422
and my baby sis.

20:41.225 --> 20:43.226
I know this sounds weird,
but I think I might have

20:43.260 --> 20:45.295
some kind of psychic link
with the Cosmic Seed.

20:45.329 --> 20:47.463
It's like it's trying
to show me where it is

20:47.498 --> 20:49.365
with these pictures in my head.

20:49.400 --> 20:51.367
If I could just figure out what
they mean, we might be able

20:51.402 --> 20:54.370
to find the Seed after all,
with or without the Boom Box.

20:55.606 --> 20:58.508
Why don't you get
some rest first, Quill?

20:58.542 --> 21:00.410
You've been through a lot.

21:00.444 --> 21:04.180
Yeah. Yeah, you know,
maybe you're right.

21:04.315 --> 21:06.182
<i>â™ª Love's a roller coaster â™ª</i>

21:06.216 --> 21:08.184
<i>â™ª</i>

21:12.389 --> 21:14.457
<i>â™ª Oh, oh, oh â™ª</i>

21:14.491 --> 21:18.528
<i>â™ª And I hope this ain't a
dream, and you're real â™ª</i>

21:18.562 --> 21:22.465
<i>â™ª 'Cause my heart
is beating through my chest â™ª</i>

21:22.499 --> 21:25.268
<i>â™ª</i>

21:27.237 --> 21:29.472
No way!
