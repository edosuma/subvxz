WEBVTT

00:01.392 --> 00:03.177
PREVIOUSLY ON "THE 100"...

00:03.220 --> 00:05.831
THIS IS HOW MY PEOPLE
SHOW THEY'RE READY
TO GO TO WAR.

00:05.875 --> 00:07.616
DO THE REST OF YOU
AGREE WITH ECHO?

00:07.659 --> 00:09.096
OCTAVIA: FREE US,

00:09.139 --> 00:10.053
AND WE'LL FIGHT
YOUR WAR.

00:10.097 --> 00:11.228
ANDERS: TRAINING
STARTS TOMORROW.

00:11.272 --> 00:13.100
I'LL MAKE DISCIPLES
OF YOU YET.

00:13.143 --> 00:14.405
HOW DOES IT WORK?

00:14.449 --> 00:15.754
WELL, YOU KILLED
MY BEST FRIEND,

00:15.798 --> 00:17.278
SO I'M NOT SURE
I WANT TO HELP YOU.

00:17.321 --> 00:18.714
-I'LL DO ANYTHING.
-OUR OTHER FRIENDS--

00:18.757 --> 00:20.020
BRING THEM HERE.

00:20.063 --> 00:21.325
CADOGAN:
SEND IN THEIR FRIENDS.

00:23.284 --> 00:24.676
MURPHY: INDRA,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:24.720 --> 00:26.156
INDRA: KILLING A DEMON.

00:26.200 --> 00:28.158
THIS IS WHAT HE WANTED.
OPEN THE DOOR!

00:38.299 --> 00:40.170
EMORI: WE'VE GOT
ANOTHER LIVE ONE!

00:48.526 --> 00:50.572
I NEED YOU TO
STAY STILL, OK?

00:50.615 --> 00:52.748
OK. WE'RE GONNA
GET YOU OUT OF HERE.

00:52.791 --> 00:55.229
OH, NO! OHH!

00:55.272 --> 00:56.969
TAKE CARE OF MY SON.

00:57.013 --> 00:59.102
YOU TAKE CARE OF HIM
YOURSELF, ALL RIGHT?

00:59.146 --> 01:00.930
I'M NOT LETTING
YOU DIE.

01:00.973 --> 01:04.064
INDRA: SHEIDHEDA--
WHERE IS HE?

01:04.107 --> 01:05.935
EMORI: WE RUSHED IN
TO HELP THE FAITHFUL.

01:05.978 --> 01:08.938
BEFORE WE KNEW IT,
HE WAS GONE.

01:08.981 --> 01:11.027
INDRA: HE ESCAPED
THROUGH THE SECRET PASSAGE.

01:11.071 --> 01:14.074
WE NEED TO FIND HIM
BEFORE HE CAN REACH WONKRU.

01:14.117 --> 01:16.467
WELL, MIGHT BE
A LITTLE LATE FOR THAT.

01:16.511 --> 01:18.295
YOUR BUDDY KNIGHT'S
GONE, TOO.

01:18.339 --> 01:20.036
SANGEDAKRU WILL
FOLLOW HIM.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.646
HE'S ONE OF THEIR OWN.

01:21.690 --> 01:23.648
THE OTHER CLANS WILL
TAKE MORE CONVINCING,

01:23.692 --> 01:25.215
BUT WITH
NO ALTERNATIVE--

01:25.259 --> 01:27.391
EMORI: THERE IS
AN ALTERNATIVE.

01:29.263 --> 01:30.655
MADI!

01:47.716 --> 01:49.283
MAN: LET'S LEAVE.

01:49.326 --> 01:52.155
GO, GO, GO.
COME ON.

01:58.379 --> 02:00.511
MADI KOM LOUWODA
KLIRON KRU.

02:04.950 --> 02:07.214
RUSSELL?

02:07.257 --> 02:09.303
I--I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
YOU SPOKE--

02:21.793 --> 02:23.143
SHEIDHEDA.

02:32.239 --> 02:35.372
IN THE FLESH...AGAIN.

02:37.896 --> 02:40.508
YOU BETRAYED ME,
MADI.

02:40.551 --> 02:42.640
I OFFERED YOU
THE WORLD,

02:42.684 --> 02:46.296
AND YOU CHOSE
WEAKNESS,

02:46.340 --> 02:49.299
LOVE.

02:49.343 --> 02:51.301
I'D LIKE TO SEE
YOU BLEED.

02:54.739 --> 02:57.394
UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME,

02:57.438 --> 03:01.093
INDRA'S REIGN
HAS CHANGED THINGS.

03:04.967 --> 03:08.579
YEAH. YES.
THEY FOLLOW HER.

03:08.623 --> 03:12.714
DESPITE THE REDNESS
OF HER BLOOD. HMM?

03:12.757 --> 03:15.195
THIS FREE REIN
WON'T DO AT ALL.

03:25.509 --> 03:28.338
I'M IN A QUANDARY,
MADI.

03:28.382 --> 03:30.297
AS A FELLOW
FORMER COMMANDER,

03:30.340 --> 03:34.039
YOU HAVE A CLAIM
TO THE THRONE,

03:34.083 --> 03:36.651
AND WHILE KILLING YOU
SOLVES THAT PROBLEM,

03:36.694 --> 03:39.044
IT MAKES MY INDRA
PROBLEM WORSE.

03:40.959 --> 03:43.397
SHE MAY BE AN IMPOSTER,
BUT SHE DOES HAVE
FOLLOWERS,

03:43.440 --> 03:45.399
TRIKRU FOOLS MOSTLY,

03:45.442 --> 03:49.185
BUT GROUNDERS
JUST THE SAME,

03:49.229 --> 03:51.405
MY PEOPLE
JUST THE SAME.

03:51.448 --> 03:52.841
I'LL GIVE THEM
A CHANCE TO KNEEL

03:52.884 --> 03:54.625
JUST LIKE I'M
GIVING IT TO YOU.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.806
KNEEL FOR ME
RIGHT NOW, MADI,

04:01.850 --> 04:05.114
AND I'LL LET YOU LIVE.

04:05.157 --> 04:06.855
REFUSE TO KNEEL...

04:11.903 --> 04:14.341
AND I'LL SLICE OPEN
THE CHESTS

04:14.384 --> 04:17.822
OF EVERY PERSON
YOU LOVE

04:17.866 --> 04:22.044
AND FEED THEIR HEARTS
TO YOUR DOG.

04:23.654 --> 04:26.091
HMM?

04:26.135 --> 04:27.484
HMM.

04:35.492 --> 04:37.146
GOOD GIRL.

04:37.189 --> 04:39.670
I'M SO GLAD WE'VE COME
TO THIS UNDERSTANDING.

05:39.556 --> 05:42.385
LET THEM GO.

05:42.429 --> 05:44.474
THEY'RE NOT
MY PRISONERS, CLARKE.

05:47.521 --> 05:50.393
GREAT. THEN
HERE'S THE DEAL.

05:50.437 --> 05:53.004
I'LL USE THE KEY
TO HELP YOU

05:53.048 --> 05:57.618
BUT ONLY AFTER YOU
LET MY PEOPLE RETURN
TO SANCTUM,

05:57.661 --> 05:59.054
ALL OF THEM.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.841
YOU'RE FREE TO GO
WITH HER.

06:08.193 --> 06:10.065
ECHO: WE'RE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

06:14.896 --> 06:16.680
WE HAVE A WAR
TO FIGHT.

06:24.775 --> 06:26.473
WE'RE STAYING,
TOO, SIR.

06:44.012 --> 06:45.927
WHAT DID YOU
DO TO THEM?

06:45.970 --> 06:48.625
ANDERS: WE DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING.

06:48.669 --> 06:50.801
THEY'RE SIMPLY COMMITTED
TO THE CAUSE,

06:50.845 --> 06:53.587
READY TO SERVE MANKIND
IN THE LAST WAR.

06:53.630 --> 06:55.458
A MOMENT THAT WILL
SOON BE UPON US

06:55.502 --> 06:56.851
NOW THAT YOU'RE HERE

06:56.894 --> 06:59.288
WITH THE HELP
OF THE KEY.

06:59.331 --> 07:01.072
SO HERE'S
THE NEW DEAL.

07:01.116 --> 07:03.161
WE TALK TO OUR
FRIENDS ALONE.

07:03.205 --> 07:05.860
I DON'T EVEN WANT
TO SEE YOUR MEN
IN THE HALLS.

07:05.903 --> 07:08.645
YOU WANT MY HELP?
EARN IT.

07:08.689 --> 07:11.735
FIRST DISCIPLE ANDERS,
HAVE ALL NONESSENTIAL
PERSONNEL

07:11.779 --> 07:13.389
RETURN TO LIVSEC.

07:13.433 --> 07:16.958
SIR, I'M NOT SURE
IF THAT'S--

07:17.001 --> 07:19.351
YES, MY SHEPHERD.

07:19.395 --> 07:21.353
GOOD.

07:21.397 --> 07:23.791
YOUR SHEPHERD
STAYS HERE.

07:23.834 --> 07:25.619
THE REST OF YOU OUT.

07:28.317 --> 07:29.492
NOW!

07:29.536 --> 07:30.754
MILLER: IN OTHER WORDS,

07:30.798 --> 07:32.626
GET THE FLOCK
OUT OF HERE.

07:32.669 --> 07:35.498
GO. I'LL BE FINE.

07:45.639 --> 07:47.728
CLARKE: MILLER, PUT HIM
AGAINST THE WALL.

07:50.731 --> 07:52.080
MILLER: LET'S GO.

07:55.039 --> 07:56.258
JORDAN:
I HAVE QUESTIONS.

07:56.301 --> 07:58.434
YEAH. GET IN LINE.

07:58.478 --> 08:01.481
ECHO, OCTAVIA,
AND DIYOZA ARE
WITH THEM NOW?

08:01.524 --> 08:04.309
CLARKE: WHY THE HELL
DO THEY THINK I HAVE
THE FLAME IN MY HEAD?

08:04.353 --> 08:06.877
THAT WAS FOR ONE DAY
OVER 100 YEARS AGO.

08:06.921 --> 08:09.097
M-CAP,
MEMORY CAPTURE,

08:09.140 --> 08:11.099
A DEVICE THAT'S
ABLE TO PULL
SELECT MEMORIES

08:11.142 --> 08:12.579
FROM ONE'S MIND.

08:12.622 --> 08:14.276
THEY PUT OCTAVIA
IN IT.

08:14.319 --> 08:17.192
AND SAW THE FLAME
GOING INTO HER HEAD
IN POLIS.

08:17.235 --> 08:18.802
AMAZING.

08:18.846 --> 08:21.370
WAIT. IF THEY STILL THINK
IT'S IN CLARK'S HEAD,

08:21.413 --> 08:25.635
THEN ECHO, OCTAVIA,
AND DIYOZA NEVER TOLD
THEM IT ISN'T, MEANING--

08:25.679 --> 08:27.855
NIYLAH: THEY'RE NOT
WITH THEM.

08:27.898 --> 08:31.641
OK. NIYLAH, GABRIEL,
JORDAN, YOU STAY HERE,

08:31.685 --> 08:33.774
WATCH CADOGAN,
AND HOLD THIS ROOM.

08:33.817 --> 08:35.863
IF THINGS GO SOUTH,
WE'RE GONNA NEED
A WAY OUT.

08:35.906 --> 08:37.778
LET'S GO FIND OUT
WHAT THE 3 MOST
DANGEROUS WOMEN

08:37.821 --> 08:40.084
ON THIS OR ANY
PLANET ARE UP TO.

08:44.611 --> 08:46.917
WOMAN: MOVING DAY.
ON YOUR FEET.

08:52.488 --> 08:54.577
YOU'RE REALLY GONNA
LET THEM SEND ME
TO PENANCE?

08:57.449 --> 08:59.756
ERR! AAH!

08:59.800 --> 09:01.889
AAH!

09:01.932 --> 09:04.108
AAH!

09:05.545 --> 09:07.634
SEEKER DIYOZA,
YOU WILL NEVER COMMIT

09:07.677 --> 09:09.461
TO THE CAUSE IF
YOU CONTINUE TO--

09:09.505 --> 09:12.073
UNH!

09:17.948 --> 09:21.125
WHAT? YOU DIDN'T REALLY
THINK I BELIEVE THIS GARBAGE.

09:21.169 --> 09:24.564
WE'RE GONNA KILL THEM,
ALL OF THEM.

09:24.607 --> 09:26.696
YOU HAVE A PLAN.

09:26.740 --> 09:28.655
TOOK SOME CONVINCING
TO GET OUR FRIEND LEVITT
TO HELP ME,

09:28.698 --> 09:30.221
BUT, YES,
I HAVE A PLAN.

09:30.265 --> 09:31.614
WHAT CAN I DO?

09:31.658 --> 09:34.225
THERE'S BEEN
A COMPLICATION.

09:34.269 --> 09:36.184
OUR PEOPLE ARE HERE--

09:36.227 --> 09:38.882
CLARKE, RAVEN, MILLER,
NIYLAH, JORDAN.

09:38.926 --> 09:41.972
THE WATCHES
ARE SYNCHED.

09:42.016 --> 09:44.714
PUT ON THE GUARD'S
UNIFORM AND TAKE THIS.

09:44.758 --> 09:46.716
I'LL GIVE YOU EXACTLY
ONE HOUR TO GET EVERYONE

09:46.760 --> 09:48.849
WE CARE ABOUT
OFF THIS PLANET.

09:48.892 --> 09:51.068
ONE HOUR, HOPE.

09:51.112 --> 09:53.331
WHAT IF I CAN'T?

09:53.375 --> 09:55.159
CAN'T ISN'T AN OPTION.

09:55.203 --> 09:56.596
YOU TELL THEM IF
THEY'RE STILL HERE

09:56.639 --> 09:58.946
THEN THEY DIE, TOO.

09:58.989 --> 10:00.382
THEY'LL WANT TO KNOW
HOW I'M DOING THIS.

10:00.425 --> 10:02.079
THAT'S WHY I HAVEN'T
TOLD YOU.

10:02.123 --> 10:03.559
ONE HOUR.

10:04.778 --> 10:05.909
OK.

10:07.302 --> 10:11.436
MADI!
MADI, ARE YOU HERE?

10:11.480 --> 10:13.264
ARE WE SURE THIS
IS WHERE SHE WENT?

10:13.308 --> 10:14.570
IT'S THE LAST PLACE
SHE WAS SEEN.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.441
GO SEARCH THE PERIMETERS.

10:16.485 --> 10:18.879
I'LL TAKE THE KITCHEN.
EMORI, THE BASEMENT.

10:18.922 --> 10:20.315
MURPHY.

10:20.358 --> 10:21.751
I GOT UPSTAIRS.

10:27.409 --> 10:28.845
OH, GOD. HEY.

10:28.889 --> 10:30.194
MADI, MADI, MADI,
STOP.

10:30.238 --> 10:31.718
IT'S OK. IT'S OK.
IT'S ME.

10:31.761 --> 10:33.197
MURPHY?
THANK GOD.

10:33.241 --> 10:34.677
HEY. HEY.

10:34.721 --> 10:37.985
YOU'RE OK.
YOU'RE OK.

10:38.028 --> 10:39.900
GUYS, I GOT HER!

10:39.943 --> 10:42.903
SHEIDHEDA--HE--HE'S
ALIVE. HE'S HERE.

10:42.946 --> 10:45.862
HEY. LOOK AT ME.
YOU ARE SAFE NOW, OK?

10:45.906 --> 10:47.690
JUST SIT DOWN,
SIT DOWN, SIT DOWN.

10:47.734 --> 10:49.692
LOOK AT ME, LOOK AT ME

10:49.736 --> 10:51.825
AND BREATHE IN THROUGH
YOUR NOSE, ALL RIGHT,
WITH ME LIKE THIS.

10:59.267 --> 11:00.398
ONE MORE TIME.

11:03.924 --> 11:05.403
THERE YOU GO.

11:07.579 --> 11:09.799
EMORI: MADI.

11:09.843 --> 11:14.282
SEE? WE WON'T LET
ANYTHING HAPPEN TO YOU.

11:16.893 --> 11:19.983
HE'S BROADCASTING
FROM THE PALACE.

11:20.027 --> 11:21.506
MURPHY:
MADI, COME WITH US.

11:28.383 --> 11:31.212
INDRA: LET'S MOVE.
WE KNOW WHERE HE IS.

11:38.088 --> 11:40.264
I GAVE YOU AN ORDER!

11:45.792 --> 11:47.184
KEEP MADI SAFE.

11:50.100 --> 11:52.102
GO GET THE BASTARD.

12:08.553 --> 12:11.469
SHE MUST HAVE BEEN
IMPORTANT,

12:11.513 --> 12:15.691
MY CALLIE, FOR HER
LANGUAGE TO SURVIVE
ALL THIS TIME.

12:17.780 --> 12:21.131
KALLIOPE PRAMFLEIMKEPA.

12:21.175 --> 12:24.526
THEY SAY SHE WAS
BRAVE, STRONG.

12:24.569 --> 12:27.311
LEGEND HAS IT
WHEN SHE DIED, EVEN
HER ENEMIES WEPT.

12:29.923 --> 12:32.795
WHAT DOES PRAM...

12:35.885 --> 12:39.584
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

12:39.628 --> 12:44.285
GABRIEL: FUNNY.
I REMEMBER YOU
DIFFERENTLY.

12:44.328 --> 12:46.722
HOW ARE YOU
STILL ALIVE?

12:46.766 --> 12:48.376
CRYOGENICS.

12:48.419 --> 12:50.247
PLUS A WELL-BALANCED DIET.

12:53.163 --> 12:55.687
AH.

12:55.731 --> 12:57.646
YES.

12:57.689 --> 13:00.475
GABRIEL, RIGHT?

13:00.518 --> 13:02.303
ANDERS SAID YOU
WERE LIKE ME--

13:02.346 --> 13:06.133
IMMORTAL, FROM EARTH,
WORSHIPPED BY HIS PEOPLE.

13:06.176 --> 13:10.659
UH, NO. NO.
NOT LIKE YOU.

13:10.702 --> 13:12.313
I LOST MY WAY
FOR A TIME,

13:12.356 --> 13:14.358
BUT I NEVER ACTUALLY
BELIEVED I WAS A GOD.

13:14.402 --> 13:15.969
WE'RE ALL GODS, DOCTOR,
AND WE'RE ALL

13:16.012 --> 13:17.492
ON A JOURNEY
TO TRANSCENDENCE

13:17.535 --> 13:20.234
EVEN IF WE TOOK
DIFFERENT PATHS.

13:20.277 --> 13:22.105
NOW THAT SOUNDS
LIKE YOU.

13:22.149 --> 13:24.586
I MUST SAY...

13:24.629 --> 13:26.849
IT IS NICE TO TALK
TO SOMEONE FROM THAT TIME,

13:26.893 --> 13:29.243
AND, YES, I WAS
DIFFERENT THEN,

13:29.286 --> 13:32.420
BUT A MAN LEARNS A LOT
AS THE CENTURIES TICK PAST,

13:32.463 --> 13:33.943
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE,
DOCTOR?

13:33.987 --> 13:37.294
HMM. SO WHAT
HAVE YOU LEARNED?

13:37.338 --> 13:38.513
AH.

13:40.820 --> 13:44.127
WE FOUND THESE LOGS

13:44.171 --> 13:47.087
WHEN WE ARRIVED,

13:47.130 --> 13:49.045
REMNANTS FROM
THE CIVILIZATION

13:49.089 --> 13:53.180
THAT LIVED HERE
BEFORE--THE BARDOANS.

13:53.223 --> 13:55.051
IT TOOK CENTURIES.

13:55.095 --> 13:57.837
WE FINALLY TRANSLATED
THE CHARACTERS.

13:57.880 --> 14:01.841
IT'S A STORY
NOT UNLIKE OUR OWN,

14:01.884 --> 14:05.888
BUT THIS IS THE PART
I FIND MOST INTRIGUING.

14:09.283 --> 14:11.546
"THE ORB BECOMES
LIKE A STAR,

14:11.589 --> 14:13.374
"CHALLENGING ALL
WE HAVE DONE

14:13.417 --> 14:15.767
AND ALL THAT WE ARE."

14:15.811 --> 14:18.031
BEAUTIFUL,
DON'T YOU THINK?

14:19.641 --> 14:22.905
"ONLY THEN WILL
THE LAST WAR BEGIN.

14:22.949 --> 14:26.691
"MAKE IT PAST AND CEASE
TO BE FALLIBLE.

14:26.735 --> 14:28.476
"TRANSCEND INTO GREATNESS.

14:28.519 --> 14:31.435
EVOLVE INTO MORE."

14:31.479 --> 14:33.133
I LIKE THE RHYMING PART
BETTER.

14:33.176 --> 14:35.091
GABRIEL: THE BARDOANS
DIDN'T RECORD THE CODE?

14:35.135 --> 14:37.528
OH, I WISH IT
WERE THAT EASY.

14:37.572 --> 14:40.053
THAT'S WHY
YOU NEED CLARKE.

14:40.096 --> 14:43.404
YES. THE AI
KNOWS THE CODE.

14:43.447 --> 14:44.927
WE ENTER IT,

14:44.971 --> 14:48.975
AND OUR LAST WAR
BEGINS.

14:49.018 --> 14:50.933
JORDAN: RIDICULOUS.

14:50.977 --> 14:53.762
WE EVOLVE TO A HIGHER LEVEL
THROUGH OUR LOWEST BEHAVIOR?

14:53.805 --> 14:55.633
THE ANSWER TO ALL
THIS VIOLENCE ISN'T

14:55.677 --> 14:57.200
JUST MORE VIOLENCE.

14:57.244 --> 14:59.724
CADOGAN: THE END
OF VIOLENCE,

14:59.768 --> 15:02.510
THE LAST WAR.

15:02.553 --> 15:06.470
EVERY WAR SEEMS LIKE
THE LAST ONE UNTIL THE NEXT.

15:06.514 --> 15:08.951
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME?

15:08.995 --> 15:11.040
HAVE AT IT.
IT'S ALL THERE.

15:11.084 --> 15:13.608
IN THE MEANTIME,

15:13.651 --> 15:16.350
I'M FAMISHED.

15:16.393 --> 15:17.960
NIYLAH: STOP.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:18.004 --> 15:19.483
HAVING LUNCH.

15:19.527 --> 15:21.355
YOU'RE ALL WELCOME
TO JOIN ME.

15:21.398 --> 15:23.009
GABRIEL: NO, NO, NO.
IF WE SHOOT HIM, WE
LOSE OUR LEVERAGE.

15:23.052 --> 15:27.100
WHAT DO WE DO?
WE CAN'T LEAVE HERE.

15:27.143 --> 15:29.537
I'LL BRING HIM BACK
AFTER LUNCH.

15:35.499 --> 15:37.327
WHAT THE HELL
IS SHE THINKING?

15:37.371 --> 15:39.895
OH, I GET PLAYING
GOOD, LITTLE SOLDIER
TO STAY ALIVE,

15:39.939 --> 15:41.897
BUT WHEN SOMEBODY
HANDS YOU A ONE-WAY
TICKET OUT OF HERE,

15:41.941 --> 15:43.420
YOU TAKE IT.

15:43.464 --> 15:45.335
WILL YOU
STOP PACING?

15:45.379 --> 15:46.858
WE'LL GET TO HOPE
BEFORE THEY TAKE HER
TO PENANCE.

15:46.902 --> 15:48.991
HOW?

15:49.035 --> 15:50.210
OCTAVIA: WHOA.

15:59.741 --> 16:01.221
I'M SO SORRY,
OCTAVIA.

16:01.264 --> 16:03.963
I KNOW.

16:04.006 --> 16:05.355
SO AM I.

16:12.232 --> 16:13.755
NO GUARDS?

16:13.798 --> 16:15.322
RAVEN: CLARKE
THREATENED NOT TO HELP

16:15.365 --> 16:17.324
WITH THE FLAME IF THEY
GOT IN HER WAY.

16:17.367 --> 16:19.195
THANKS FOR PLAYING
THAT ONE CARDS DOWN,
BY THE WAY.

16:19.239 --> 16:20.631
I THOUGHT IT WAS
GOOD LEVERAGE,

16:20.675 --> 16:22.372
KNOWING YOU WOULD
EVENTUALLY SHOW UP.

16:25.027 --> 16:26.594
WE'RE GLAD YOU DID.

16:33.427 --> 16:35.124
JUST HUG ME BACK, MILLER.

16:40.086 --> 16:41.391
DIYOZA: WAIT!

16:41.435 --> 16:43.002
SHE'S NOT ONE
OF THEM.

16:46.048 --> 16:49.095
CLARKE.

16:49.138 --> 16:52.272
RAVEN.

16:52.315 --> 16:54.752
MILLER.

16:54.796 --> 16:56.711
YOU DESCRIBED
THEM WELL.

16:56.754 --> 17:00.062
DIYOZA: THIS IS HOPE,
MY DAUGHTER.

17:00.106 --> 17:02.325
TIME DILATION'S
A BITCH.

17:02.369 --> 17:04.284
HOW'D YOU GET OUT?

17:04.327 --> 17:05.894
DOESN'T MATTER.
RIGHT NOW, WE NEED TO

17:05.937 --> 17:07.287
GET OURSELVES
TO THE STONE ROOM

17:07.330 --> 17:09.680
AND GET OUT OF BARDO.

17:09.724 --> 17:11.769
WE CAN GET
ACQUAINTED LATER.

17:11.813 --> 17:13.032
LET'S GO.

17:16.557 --> 17:18.689
HEY. WHERE'S ECHO?

17:18.733 --> 17:20.169
SHE'LL CATCH UP.

17:20.213 --> 17:23.216
DIYOZA: SHE WILL, HUH?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

17:23.259 --> 17:24.956
HOPE.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.915
SHE'S GETTING REVENGE
FOR BELLAMY.

17:26.958 --> 17:30.179
TALK NOW.

17:30.223 --> 17:33.356
ALL I KNOW IS
THAT WE HAVE...

17:33.400 --> 17:36.359
45 MINUTES TO GET
YOU OFF THIS PLANET.

17:36.403 --> 17:38.100
WHAT HAPPENS
IN 45 MINUTES?

17:38.144 --> 17:39.754
I DON'T KNOW.

17:39.797 --> 17:42.452
REALLY. LEVITT
HELPED HER WITH SOMETHING,

17:42.496 --> 17:44.106
AND SHE DIDN'T TELL ME
WHAT IT WAS

17:44.150 --> 17:45.629
BECAUSE SHE KNEW YOU'D
GET IT OUT OF ME

17:45.673 --> 17:47.109
AND TRY AND STOP HER.

17:47.153 --> 17:48.328
OCTAVIA: LEVITT
WOULDN'T HELP HER.

17:48.371 --> 17:49.764
WHAT DID SHE
DO TO HIM?

17:49.807 --> 17:52.027
-HE'S ALIVE, OK?
-LET'S MOVE.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.811
AUNTY O.,
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

17:53.855 --> 17:55.422
TO FIND LEVITT.

17:55.465 --> 17:57.772
-HOPE.
-SHH.

17:57.815 --> 17:59.339
SOMEONE COULD HEAR US.

17:59.382 --> 18:01.254
HOW COULD YOU LET
HER DO THIS?

18:01.297 --> 18:03.734
BECAUSE I WANT HER TO.

18:03.778 --> 18:05.867
THEY TOOK EVERYTHING
FROM ME.

18:05.910 --> 18:09.218
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO KILL INNOCENT PEOPLE
FOR A CAUSE,

18:09.262 --> 18:13.135
AND I PROMISE YOU, IT'S
NOT GONNA FILL THAT HOLE
IN YOUR HEART.

18:13.179 --> 18:16.399
ONLY WE CAN DO THAT.

18:16.443 --> 18:18.619
THERE ARE NO
INNOCENT PEOPLE HERE.

18:50.346 --> 18:52.827
WOMAN: LIAR.

19:02.315 --> 19:05.579
LOOK AT THEIR EYES.
THEY HATE US.

19:05.622 --> 19:07.581
AT LEAST THEY'RE
ALIVE TO HATE US.

19:07.624 --> 19:10.410
YEAH. SURE. AT LEAST UNTIL
SHEIDHEDA AND HIS ARMY

19:10.453 --> 19:12.629
COME BACK TO FINISH
WHAT HE STARTED.

19:12.673 --> 19:14.240
NO. INDRA WON'T
LET THAT HAPPEN.

19:14.283 --> 19:16.503
NO? LOOK. YOU SAW
THE FACES OF HER GUARDS

19:16.546 --> 19:18.331
WHEN HE WAS SPEAKING.

19:18.374 --> 19:20.071
THEY WERE TRIKRU,
LOYAL TO HER,

19:20.115 --> 19:22.073
AND HE WAS STILL
GETTING TO THEM.

19:22.117 --> 19:24.511
WELL, JOHN, EVEN IF
HE DOES TAKE CONTROL,

19:24.554 --> 19:27.862
THESE PEOPLE AREN'T
A THREAT TO HIM.

19:29.820 --> 19:31.387
THEY WILL BE.

19:31.431 --> 19:33.215
WHEN WE WERE PLAYING
CHESS, HE MADE SURE

19:33.259 --> 19:34.651
TO TAKE MY PAWNS
SO THEY COULDN'T MOVE

19:34.695 --> 19:36.871
ACROSS THE BOARD
TO GET PROMOTED.

19:36.914 --> 19:38.699
TAKING OUT THE FAITHFUL
BEFORE THEY CAN GET
REVENGE WILL BE

19:38.742 --> 19:40.179
RIGHT BELOW MADI
ON HIS LIST

19:40.222 --> 19:42.398
OF PRIORITIES,
ALL RIGHT?

19:42.442 --> 19:46.228
I'M TELLING YOU,
THESE PEOPLE
ARE IN DANGER.

19:46.272 --> 19:49.275
IF YOU'RE RIGHT
AND WE HELP THEM,

19:49.318 --> 19:51.233
THEN SO ARE WE.

19:52.843 --> 19:55.019
YEAH. I'M AWARE.

20:00.764 --> 20:03.158
COME. SIT. I THINK
YOU'LL ENJOY THIS.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.029
IT'S SOME THINGS
FROM OUR TIME.

20:05.073 --> 20:07.815
NOT MY TIME.

20:07.858 --> 20:10.165
MY, UH--MY
MOTHER'S MAYBE.

20:10.209 --> 20:11.993
HO HO HO!

20:12.036 --> 20:14.517
THAT WAS JUST MEAN.

20:14.561 --> 20:16.519
IT'S HARD TO MAKE ME
FEEL OLDER THAN I AM,

20:16.563 --> 20:18.826
BUT, UH, GO AHEAD.

20:18.869 --> 20:20.567
JUST TAKE A SIP.

20:26.399 --> 20:28.488
HEH. KOMBUCHA.

20:28.531 --> 20:30.054
IT'S WONDERFUL,
ISN'T IT?

20:30.098 --> 20:31.708
IT'S GOOD
FOR THE GUT, TOO.

20:34.145 --> 20:36.017
IT REMINDS YOU
OF SOMETHING.

20:36.060 --> 20:37.975
YEAH. MY GRANDMOTHER
IN COLOMBIA.

20:38.019 --> 20:39.760
SHE MADE HER OWN

20:39.803 --> 20:41.675
RIGHT BEFORE THEY CUT
OFF HER DRINKING WATER

20:41.718 --> 20:45.287
SO THE RICH COULD
WATER THEIR LAWNS.

20:45.331 --> 20:47.115
THEN YOU
ARE SELF-MADE.

20:47.158 --> 20:49.813
HMM.
ME, TOO.

20:49.857 --> 20:51.989
MY FIRST JOB WAS
FLIPPING BURGERS,

20:52.033 --> 20:54.253
DREAMING OF THE DAY
I'D ESCAPE.

20:54.296 --> 20:56.864
WELL, YOU CERTAINLY
DID THAT.

20:56.907 --> 20:58.692
THAT I DID. I KNEW THERE
HAD TO BE SOMETHING MORE

20:58.735 --> 21:01.738
THAN POLITICS,
THE DYING ECOSYSTEM,

21:01.782 --> 21:04.088
THE MEMES.

21:04.132 --> 21:06.134
EARTH WAS
PRETTY TERRIBLE.

21:06.177 --> 21:08.179
IT GOT WORSE
AFTER YOU LEFT.

21:08.223 --> 21:10.225
GOOD FOR THE CULT
BUSINESS, THOUGH,
AM I RIGHT?

21:10.269 --> 21:14.055
HMM. HEH.

21:14.098 --> 21:15.796
WE WEREN'T A CULT...

21:17.667 --> 21:21.062
BUT BEING RIGHT IS
ALWAYS GOOD FOR BUSINESS.

21:21.105 --> 21:22.716
LOOK. I DON'T MEAN
TO BE RUDE,

21:22.759 --> 21:24.979
BUT, UH, AS I SAID,

21:25.022 --> 21:26.589
I HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE
WITH PEOPLE

21:26.633 --> 21:28.243
CLAIMING TO BE GODS.

21:28.287 --> 21:31.551
HMM. I DON'T CLAIM THAT.

21:31.594 --> 21:35.685
IN FACT, I DON'T
EVEN BELIEVE IN GOD.

21:37.339 --> 21:40.211
I DO, HOWEVER, BELIEVE
THAT I WAS CHOSEN

21:40.255 --> 21:42.126
MM-HMM.

21:42.170 --> 21:44.390
BY WHOM IF NOT GOD?

21:44.433 --> 21:46.522
WE'LL FIND OUT
WHEN WE WIN THE WAR.

21:46.566 --> 21:48.002
WHAT IF YOU LOSE?

21:48.045 --> 21:50.004
WE...WON'T.

21:50.047 --> 21:52.006
"FOR ALL MANKIND."
IS THAT IT?

21:52.049 --> 21:54.748
DAMN RIGHT.

21:54.791 --> 21:57.185
YOU CAN THANK ME
WHEN WE SAVE YOU,

21:57.228 --> 21:58.752
OR YOU CAN JOIN US.

22:01.755 --> 22:04.497
JOIN YOUR WAR TO
SAVE THE HUMAN RACE

22:04.540 --> 22:07.630
BY RENOUNCING EVERYTHING
THAT MAKES ME HUMAN?

22:09.937 --> 22:14.681
LOVE, FAMILY--
THOSE ARE THE THINGS
THAT CONNECT US.

22:14.724 --> 22:19.207
WE'RE NOT JUST DNA.
WE'RE EMOTION.

22:19.250 --> 22:21.688
WITHOUT THAT, WHAT
ARE YOU FIGHTING FOR?

22:21.731 --> 22:24.386
LET ME ASK YOU
SOMETHING, DOCTOR.

22:24.430 --> 22:27.955
HAVE YOU EVER DONE
ANYTHING YOU REGRET

22:27.998 --> 22:31.045
IN THE NAME OF LOVE?

22:31.088 --> 22:32.873
I'LL TAKE THAT
AS A YES.

22:32.916 --> 22:35.223
THE POINT IS,
WE ALL HAVE.

22:35.266 --> 22:40.184
WE ALL FIGHT
FOR OUR FAMILIES,
OUR COUNTRIES.

22:40.228 --> 22:41.751
WE DO WHATEVER
WE HAVE TO

22:41.795 --> 22:45.276
SO THAT OUR SIDE
CAN SURVIVE,

22:45.320 --> 22:47.366
AND WHEN SOMEONE
YOU LOVE...

22:49.585 --> 22:51.370
BETRAYS YOU...

22:52.893 --> 22:56.549
WELL, THAT IS
THE WORST PAIN THERE IS.

22:56.592 --> 22:58.289
WE HAVE NONE
OF THAT HERE.

23:04.470 --> 23:08.517
WITH ALL--AHEM--
DUE RESPECT,

23:08.561 --> 23:10.345
YOU CAN'T FIGHT
A WAR FOR THE SOUL

23:10.389 --> 23:13.043
OF THE HUMAN RACE
WITH AN INHUMAN ARMY.

23:13.087 --> 23:16.699
WHO SAYS WE CAN'T?
I MEAN, THIS LIFE,

23:16.743 --> 23:19.485
IT DOESN'T MATTER,

23:19.528 --> 23:21.878
EVEN LIVES
AS LONG AS OURS.

23:21.922 --> 23:25.665
WHAT MATTERS IS...
WHAT COMES NEXT.

23:28.145 --> 23:30.321
WE'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT
WHAT THAT IS.

23:30.365 --> 23:32.715
THE ANSWERS THAT WE'VE
BOTH BEEN SEEKING
FOR SO LONG,

23:32.759 --> 23:35.675
THEY'RE FINALLY
WITHIN OUR GRASP.

23:35.718 --> 23:39.853
ISN'T THAT WORTH
A LITTLE SACRIFICE?

23:45.554 --> 23:48.252
ANDERS: SIR,
I NEED A MOMENT.

23:50.124 --> 23:52.256
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR COMPANY.

23:52.300 --> 23:55.346
PLEASE ESCORT DR. SANTIAGO
BACK TO HIS FRIENDS.

24:12.625 --> 24:14.888
WHAT IS IT?

24:14.931 --> 24:17.325
WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

24:23.200 --> 24:24.637
LEVITT.

24:26.726 --> 24:27.857
-HEY.
-OHH!

24:27.901 --> 24:29.598
WHAT HAPPENED?

24:29.642 --> 24:30.991
I FAILED.

24:31.034 --> 24:32.427
SHE KILLED TWO PEOPLE
IN FRONT OF ME,

24:32.471 --> 24:34.821
AND...I BROKE.

24:38.128 --> 24:39.695
WAIT. NOT YET.

24:39.739 --> 24:42.829
WE NEED TO FIND OUT
WHAT ECHO'S PLANNING.

24:42.872 --> 24:45.875
THE KEY HAS LANDED.

24:45.919 --> 24:47.790
OCTAVIA: WHAT DID
ECHO MAKE YOU DO?

24:50.663 --> 24:52.186
I HELPED HER GET IT.

24:54.710 --> 24:56.843
GEM9.

24:56.886 --> 24:59.323
MILLER: GEM9?
DIYOZA: A BIOWEAPON.

24:59.367 --> 25:00.934
IT'S THE REASON
THE SPECIES THAT WAS

25:00.977 --> 25:03.458
HERE BEFORE THEY ARRIVED
ISN'T HERE NOW.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.025
HOW'S SHE
DEPLOYING IT?

25:05.068 --> 25:08.898
CENTRAL HUMIDIFICATION
SYSTEM, THE MACHINE LEVEL.

25:11.379 --> 25:14.382
I TOLD HER HOW.
I'M SO SORRY.

25:14.425 --> 25:16.340
RAVEN: SO I'M GUESSING
IT SPREADS THROUGH WATER.

25:16.384 --> 25:19.648
HUMIDIFICATION WOULD
MAKE IT AIRBORNE.

25:19.692 --> 25:23.217
RAVEN REYES.
OF COURSE YOU'D KNOW THAT.

25:23.260 --> 25:25.741
CLARKE: AIRBORNE MEANS
IT'S A SUICIDE MISSION.

25:25.785 --> 25:27.221
NO, NO, NOT
NECESSARILY.

25:27.264 --> 25:28.918
IT WILL TAKE TIME
FOR THE COMPOUND

25:28.962 --> 25:30.572
TO GO FROM ITS ENTRY POINT
TO THE VENTS.

25:30.616 --> 25:31.965
ECHO WILL MAKE A RUN
FOR THE STONE ROOM.

25:32.008 --> 25:34.794
WHICH IS WHAT
WE SHOULD DO.

25:34.837 --> 25:36.404
SHE GAVE ME AN HOUR
TO GET YOU ALL OUT.

25:36.447 --> 25:37.753
WE STILL GOT TIME.

25:37.797 --> 25:39.320
THAT MEANS WE CAN
STILL STOP HER.

25:39.363 --> 25:41.322
UNTIE ME, PLEASE,
SO I CAN GET HELP.

25:41.365 --> 25:43.585
HOPE: AUNTY O.,
THEY WILL KILL HER.

25:43.629 --> 25:45.195
SHE'LL KILL US ALL.

25:52.638 --> 25:55.379
-NO.
-I'M SORRY.

25:57.991 --> 26:02.735
OCTAVIA! OCTAVIA!

26:02.778 --> 26:03.866
HELP!

26:08.697 --> 26:10.351
NIYLAH: WHAT ARE THE ODDS
EVERYTHING WORKS OUT

26:10.394 --> 26:13.441
AND WE JUST WALK
OUT OF HERE?

26:15.399 --> 26:16.836
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

26:16.879 --> 26:18.272
OH, MY GOD.

26:20.230 --> 26:21.536
-WHAT?
-MAYBE IT'S STRUCTURED

26:21.580 --> 26:23.146
LIKE KOREAN.

26:23.190 --> 26:24.539
WHAT?

26:24.583 --> 26:25.888
MY DAD'S FATHER
WAS KOREAN.

26:25.932 --> 26:27.150
HE TAUGHT ME
THE LANGUAGE,

26:27.194 --> 26:28.804
WHAT HE KNEW OF IT,
ANYWAY.

26:28.848 --> 26:30.763
I DIDN'T WANT TO LEARN
IT AT FIRST.

26:30.806 --> 26:34.462
IT LOOKED LIKE THERE
WOULD BE THOUSANDS
OF CHARACTERS TO STUDY.

26:34.505 --> 26:36.420
BUT THERE WEREN'T?

26:36.464 --> 26:38.466
NO. THAT'S NOT
HOW KOREAN WORKS.

26:38.509 --> 26:40.555
IT USES AN ALPHABET,
SAME AS ENGLISH,

26:40.599 --> 26:43.384
JUST WITH THE LETTERS
STACKED INTO BLOCKS
OF SYLLABLES,

26:43.427 --> 26:48.781
BLOCKS THAT ARE
EASY TO MISTAKE
AS CHARACTERS.

26:48.824 --> 26:52.393
YOU THINK CADOGAN DIDN'T
DECODE THE TEXT RIGHT?

26:52.436 --> 26:56.223
I THINK IT'S
POSSIBLE. LOOK.

26:56.266 --> 26:58.399
WHAT IF EACH
OF THESE STROKES

26:58.442 --> 27:00.444
IS JUST A LETTER?

27:00.488 --> 27:02.577
THEY COULD HAVE
THE WHOLE LANGUAGE
COMPLETELY WRONG.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.187
WELL, MAYBE NOT
THE WHOLE THING

27:04.231 --> 27:06.929
BUT MULTIPLE WORD PHRASES
LIKE "LAST WAR."

27:06.973 --> 27:08.931
NOW IT JUST SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND PROOF

27:08.975 --> 27:11.020
TO SUPPORT WHAT YOU
WANT TO BELIEVE.

27:11.064 --> 27:13.675
HOW IS THAT ANY DIFFERENT
THAN WHAT THEY'RE DOING?

27:13.719 --> 27:16.504
WE ALL SEE WHAT
WE WANT TO SEE.

27:16.547 --> 27:18.593
IF YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR THE WRONG ANSWER,

27:18.637 --> 27:21.204
IT'S EASY TO MISS
THE RIGHT ONE.

27:21.248 --> 27:24.555
COME ON. LOOK AT WHAT'S
WRITTEN ABOUT UNLOCKING
THE STONE.

27:24.599 --> 27:27.254
THERE'S NO MENTION
ABOUT VIOLENCE OR PAIN,

27:27.297 --> 27:31.824
JUST...PREPARATION,
JUDGMENT.

27:33.434 --> 27:39.048
-LIKE A TEST.
-EXACTLY. LIKE A TEST.

27:39.092 --> 27:40.833
IT WOULD MAKE SENSE.

27:44.140 --> 27:47.317
NIYLAH: WHERE'S
CADOGAN OR THE GUN
YOU TOOK?

27:47.361 --> 27:49.189
YEAH. THE LOOK ON ANDERS' FACE
MADE IT CLEAR

27:49.232 --> 27:51.017
THAT NEITHER WOULD BE
COMING BACK WITH ME.

27:54.368 --> 27:56.109
WHAT DID I MISS?

27:56.152 --> 27:58.720
NOT MUCH. JUST...

27:58.764 --> 28:01.941
THAT I'M A GENIUS.

28:01.984 --> 28:04.030
JORDAN HAS A THEORY.

28:04.073 --> 28:05.509
THAT THEY GOT IT WRONG.

28:05.553 --> 28:07.381
THE LAST WAR ISN'T
A WAR AT ALL.

28:07.424 --> 28:10.210
-IF I'M RIGHT...
-AND THAT'S A BIG IF.

28:10.253 --> 28:11.733
THEN IT'S A TEST.

28:11.777 --> 28:13.692
NOW, I'M JUST
GUESSING HERE

28:13.735 --> 28:16.216
BUT PROBABLY TO BE
TAKEN BY WHOEVER
ENTERS THE CODE.

28:16.259 --> 28:18.697
ONE INDIVIDUAL REPRESENTING
A WHOLE SPECIES.

28:18.740 --> 28:20.611
NO PRESSURE THERE.

28:20.655 --> 28:22.788
YOU GOT TO ADMIT
IT MAKES MORE SENSE
THAN A WAR.

28:24.528 --> 28:25.965
SHOULD WE TELL THEM?

28:26.008 --> 28:28.445
NO. NO, NO, NO. NO WAY.

28:28.489 --> 28:30.404
IF THERE IS A TEST
TO DECIDE THE FATE

28:30.447 --> 28:31.884
OF THE HUMAN RACE,
BILL CADOGAN SHOULD NOT BE

28:31.927 --> 28:33.537
THE ONE TO TAKE IT.

28:33.581 --> 28:34.843
COME.

28:36.453 --> 28:39.413
SHOW ME WHAT YOU--
WHAT YOU MEAN.

28:39.456 --> 28:44.244
OK. MY FATHER'S SIDE
OF THE FAMILY WAS KOREAN.

28:44.287 --> 28:45.593
NOW, IF YOU LOOK AT THESE...

28:50.685 --> 28:53.383
HE'S NOT HERE, EITHER.

28:53.427 --> 28:55.168
WE SHOULD ENLIST THE HELP
OF THE OTHER CLANS.

28:55.211 --> 28:57.126
WE CAN'T TRUST
THE OTHER CLANS.

28:57.170 --> 29:00.129
NOW MOVE OUT.
THERE ARE OTHER
ROOMS TO--

29:06.309 --> 29:08.094
HE'S RECITING
THE LINEAGE.

29:22.282 --> 29:25.372
NOW THAT THAT'S OUT OF THE WAY,

29:25.415 --> 29:32.988
I--MALACHI KOM SANGEDAKRU,
THE LAST TRUE COMMANDER--

29:33.032 --> 29:37.558
VOW TO HONOR AND DEFEND
OUR TRADITIONS

29:37.601 --> 29:41.040
AND MY PEOPLE,

29:41.083 --> 29:44.391
BUT FIRST, YOU MUST PROVE
THAT YOU ARE MY PEOPLE

29:44.434 --> 29:46.915
BY BENDING THE KNEE.

29:46.959 --> 29:49.526
IT'S QUITE SIMPLE, REALLY.

29:49.570 --> 29:52.355
IF YOU DON'T KNEEL,

29:52.399 --> 29:54.749
YOU DIE.

30:09.851 --> 30:11.766
YOUR PATH
TO THE THRONE

30:11.810 --> 30:14.421
LEADS THROUGH ME.

30:14.464 --> 30:16.989
YOU SAY YOU HONOR
OUR TRADITIONS,

30:17.032 --> 30:18.947
SO HONOR THIS ONE.

30:24.779 --> 30:26.476
I WAS HOPING
YOU'D SAY THAT.

30:38.575 --> 30:41.013
NEW LOOK FOR ME.

30:41.056 --> 30:43.406
I'M FLATTERED.

30:43.450 --> 30:46.061
MINE'S NICE, TOO,
DON'T YOU THINK?

30:46.105 --> 30:48.368
RAAH!

30:50.109 --> 30:51.458
THANK YOU, INDRA,
FOR GIVING ME

30:51.501 --> 30:53.112
EXACTLY
WHAT I WANTED--

30:53.155 --> 30:54.940
A CHANCE TO RETURN
TO THE OLD WAYS,

30:54.983 --> 30:56.245
MY WAYS.

30:56.289 --> 30:57.507
WE'LL SEE.

30:57.551 --> 30:59.379
HUH!

31:08.562 --> 31:09.780
AGH!

31:12.087 --> 31:13.610
HYAH!

31:17.876 --> 31:19.486
YAH!

31:26.014 --> 31:27.581
ARR, AAH, ARR!

31:36.677 --> 31:39.245
YOU LOOKING FOR THIS?

31:39.288 --> 31:41.247
HYAH!

31:44.772 --> 31:46.165
INDRA: GET OUT
OF THE WAY!

31:46.208 --> 31:48.123
GET OUT OF THE WAY!

31:48.167 --> 31:50.038
AAH! AAH!

31:50.082 --> 31:51.257
-AGH!
-HYAH!

31:55.261 --> 31:56.784
UNH!

32:01.223 --> 32:02.616
KNEEL OR DIE.

32:07.403 --> 32:11.016
I WON'T LET YOU
TAKE MY PEOPLE.

32:11.059 --> 32:12.495
UNH.

32:14.410 --> 32:15.890
DIE IT IS.

32:18.719 --> 32:21.983
RAAH!

32:22.027 --> 32:25.378
AAH!

32:25.421 --> 32:26.727
OHH!

32:28.120 --> 32:30.339
AAH!

32:30.383 --> 32:32.211
AAH!

32:40.567 --> 32:42.090
STOP!

32:44.484 --> 32:47.443
SPARE HER LIFE.

32:47.487 --> 32:48.792
I WILL KNEEL.

32:52.448 --> 32:56.278
AHH. AHH.

32:56.322 --> 32:57.671
UH-HUH.

33:33.098 --> 33:34.882
OHH.

33:53.683 --> 33:55.163
ERR.

34:22.625 --> 34:24.149
AHH.

34:56.050 --> 34:57.617
-NO, HEDA.
-AHH.

35:14.590 --> 35:18.116
YOU WERE RIGHT, THEN.
SHEIDHEDA WON.

35:21.902 --> 35:24.122
WE'RE SAFE IN HERE,
ALL RIGHT?

35:24.165 --> 35:25.949
THE REACTOR DOOR
IS SEALED.

35:25.993 --> 35:27.516
NO ONE CAN GET TO US.

35:31.433 --> 35:34.088
SO, WHAT NOW?

35:34.132 --> 35:36.438
THAT'S TOMORROW'S
PROBLEM.

35:36.482 --> 35:40.007
TODAY, WE SURVIVE,
ALL OF US.

35:41.922 --> 35:44.142
DON'T LOOK NOW, JOHN,

35:44.185 --> 35:47.232
BUT I THINK YOU JUST
MIGHT BE SOMEONE
WORTH BELIEVING IN.

36:36.368 --> 36:38.761
RAVEN: ECHO, NO!

36:40.285 --> 36:41.808
STOP!

36:41.851 --> 36:43.592
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO GET THEM OUT.

36:43.636 --> 36:45.072
OCTAVIA: IT'S NOT HER FAULT.
WE WOULDN'T LEAVE

36:45.115 --> 36:46.421
WITHOUT YOU, ECHO.

36:46.465 --> 36:48.467
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THIS.

36:48.510 --> 36:51.209
I GET IT. EVERYTHING
THEY TOOK FROM YOU

36:51.252 --> 36:52.645
THEY TOOK
FROM ME, TOO,

36:52.688 --> 36:54.342
BUT THERE ARE
GOOD PEOPLE HERE.

36:54.386 --> 36:57.954
WHO? LEVITT?

36:57.998 --> 36:59.434
THE MAN WHO STOLE
YOUR MEMORIES

36:59.478 --> 37:01.001
AND GAVE THEM
TO THE ENEMY?

37:01.044 --> 37:03.438
ALL OF THIS HAPPENED
BECAUSE OF HIM.

37:03.482 --> 37:06.528
WAY TO HONOR
YOUR BROTHER'S MEMORY.

37:06.572 --> 37:11.533
ECHO, THIS IS
NOT WHO YOU ARE.

37:11.577 --> 37:14.580
I KNOW YOU THINK
THIS IS THE RIGHT
THING TO DO,

37:14.623 --> 37:16.712
BUT--TRUST ME--
IT'S NOT.

37:16.756 --> 37:18.584
THERE'S ALWAYS
ANOTHER WAY.

37:18.627 --> 37:20.673
GRIEF IS SOMETHING
WE CAN LEARN
TO LIVE WITH,

37:20.716 --> 37:23.066
BUT ONCE YOU MAKE
A CHOICE LIKE THIS,

37:23.110 --> 37:25.678
IT STAYS WITH YOU.

37:25.721 --> 37:30.160
THIS IS NOTHING LIKE
THE CHOICES YOU MAKE, CLARKE.

37:30.204 --> 37:33.860
YOU TAKE LIVES
TO SAVE THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE.

37:33.903 --> 37:37.733
THIS IS VENGEANCE
PURE AND SIMPLE.

37:39.909 --> 37:41.433
CLARKE: ECHO, STOP.

37:41.476 --> 37:43.478
THIS IS NOT WHAT
BELLAMY WOULD
HAVE WANTED.

37:43.522 --> 37:47.047
ECHO: YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT BELLAMY WANTED!

37:47.090 --> 37:50.920
IF THEY KILLED ME OR YOU
OR YOU, OCTAVIA,

37:50.964 --> 37:53.271
HE WOULD BE STANDING
RIGHT WHERE I AM.

37:53.314 --> 37:54.750
RAVEN: I DON'T
THINK SO.

37:54.794 --> 37:57.275
STAY BACK!

37:57.318 --> 38:00.278
THE BELLAMY WHO HELPED
MASSACRE A SLEEPING ARMY

38:00.321 --> 38:02.323
THAT WAS SENT
TO PROTECT US

38:02.367 --> 38:05.979
MAYBE HE MIGHT
BE THERE,

38:06.022 --> 38:10.375
BUT NOT THE MAN WE SPENT
6 YEARS ON THE RING WITH,

38:10.418 --> 38:12.290
NOT THE MAN YOU
FELL IN LOVE WITH.

38:14.640 --> 38:16.816
ECHO, YOU'RE MY SISTER,

38:16.859 --> 38:18.731
AND MY SISTER
WOULDN'T DO THIS.

38:24.693 --> 38:26.216
YOU'RE WRONG.

38:28.044 --> 38:31.352
I'M NOT LEAVING, ECHO.

38:31.396 --> 38:33.311
IF YOU DROP THAT,

38:33.354 --> 38:36.618
I AM STAYING RIGHT HERE.

38:36.662 --> 38:38.490
YOU WILL HAVE
TO KILL ME, TOO.

38:47.194 --> 38:50.153
AAH!

38:50.197 --> 38:53.243
HEY, HEY, HEY.

38:53.287 --> 38:55.376
IT'S OK.

38:55.420 --> 38:58.379
IT'S OK. IT'S OK.
WE'RE HERE NOW.

39:02.035 --> 39:07.083
COME ON.
LET'S TAKE YOU HOME, OK?

39:07.127 --> 39:08.302
WE'RE GONNA GO HOME.

39:08.346 --> 39:11.131
ANDERS: GOOD CHOICE.

39:11.174 --> 39:12.828
CLARKE: WE HAD A DEAL.
I TOLD CADOGAN

39:12.872 --> 39:15.483
IF I SAW ANY OF YOU,
I WOULDN'T HELP HIM.

39:15.527 --> 39:17.659
ANDERS: THAT WAS BEFORE
WE KNEW THAT ONE OF YOU

39:17.703 --> 39:21.924
KILLED 3 MORE OF US,
TORTURING ANOTHER

39:21.968 --> 39:23.622
JUST TO GET HIM
TO GIVE YOU A WEAPON

39:23.665 --> 39:27.539
WITH WHICH
TO COMMIT GENOCIDE.

39:27.582 --> 39:32.021
THE MAN MAKES
A GOOD POINT.

39:32.065 --> 39:33.893
LET'S CALL IT EVEN.

39:33.936 --> 39:38.463
EVEN? I JUST TOLD YOU
3 DISCIPLES ARE DEAD.

39:38.506 --> 39:40.987
YOU PEOPLE DISGUST ME.

39:42.510 --> 39:44.686
LOOK AT YOURSELVES.

39:44.730 --> 39:45.948
RAISED IN THE WILD.

39:45.992 --> 39:49.517
YOU'RE NOTHING
BUT PRIMAL BEASTS

39:49.561 --> 39:52.825
UTTERLY IN THRALL
TO YOUR FEELINGS,

39:52.868 --> 39:54.827
PRIORITIZING
THE WANT OF SELF

39:54.870 --> 39:56.959
OVER THE NEED
OF ALL OTHERS.

39:57.003 --> 39:59.527
YOU DON'T DESERVE
THE SHEPHERD'S MERCY.

39:59.571 --> 40:01.486
MILLER: BRAVE WORDS
COMING FROM A MAN

40:01.529 --> 40:06.012
STANDING ALONE
IN FRONT OF A PACK
OF ARMED BEASTS.

40:06.055 --> 40:09.450
DIYOZA: HE'S NOT ALONE.
ANDERS: SMART GIRL.

40:09.494 --> 40:12.671
DIYOZA: PROBABLY
NOT A GOOD IDEA
TO FIRE LASERS

40:12.714 --> 40:14.412
IN A ROOM
WITH A WMD.

40:16.631 --> 40:20.548
LET'S GET BACK TO
THE SHEPHERD'S MERCY.

40:20.592 --> 40:23.551
ECHO WILL BE SENT
TO PENANCE FOR 20 YEARS,

40:23.595 --> 40:26.554
BUT SHE'LL BE BACK
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT

40:26.598 --> 40:29.122
UNLESS BY THEN THE CODE
HASN'T BEEN ENTERED

40:29.165 --> 40:30.602
TO BEGIN THE LAST WAR

40:30.645 --> 40:33.779
IN WHICH CASE,
SHE DIES THERE.

40:33.822 --> 40:35.476
HOPE: I HAVE A BETTER IDEA.

40:35.520 --> 40:36.956
YOU DIE HERE.

40:36.999 --> 40:38.131
HOPE, NO!

40:38.174 --> 40:39.567
UNH!

41:11.860 --> 41:13.514
HOPE: NO, MOM!
DIYOZA: GET HER OUT OF HERE!

41:13.558 --> 41:15.516
HOPE: NO! NO!
OCTAVIA: HOPE, IT'S TOO LATE!

41:15.560 --> 41:17.431
HOPE: NO. NO, MOM! NO!

41:17.475 --> 41:19.520
GO!

41:19.564 --> 41:21.261
WHAT ARE YOU ALL
WAITING FOR?

41:21.304 --> 41:22.741
MOVE! GO!

41:24.220 --> 41:26.092
MOM, I'M SORRY!

41:26.135 --> 41:27.920
HOPE, WE HAVE
NO CHOICE.

41:27.963 --> 41:31.576
I CANNOT LOSE HER,
NOT--NOT AGAIN!

41:31.619 --> 41:34.709
DON'T WASTE THIS,
LITTLE ONE!

41:34.753 --> 41:37.277
BE BETTER THAN ME.

41:39.845 --> 41:41.760
OCTAVIA: GET THE DOOR!

41:41.803 --> 41:47.374
MOM! MOM!

41:47.417 --> 41:49.724
AAH! NO!
