12:53.880 --> 12:56.770
herb-crusted rack of lamb
with caramelized fennel,

12:56.880 --> 12:58.644
finished with a red wine reduction.

12:58.760 --> 13:01.411
Keep it simple, okay?
It's my dad for Christ's sakes.

13:01.480 --> 13:03.482
He's got to taste the food
under the fancy.

13:03.560 --> 13:06.723
All right, fine! We'll do a simple,
freaking seared scallop then...

13:08.320 --> 13:12.530
with skordalia and parsley oil.

13:12.920 --> 13:15.161
- Okay. Yeah.
- Yeah?

13:15.240 --> 13:17.846
Yes! I've been dying to see how
the new Assyrtiko

13:17.960 --> 13:19.485
from Santorini pairs with seafood.

13:19.560 --> 13:21.085
I mean, that--
that could really work.

13:21.160 --> 13:22.525
Right. Right. Dessert-- dessert:

13:22.600 --> 13:27.242
A panna cotta with figs,
apricot, with a honeycomb candy.

13:27.320 --> 13:30.642
If I pair a Sauterne with that,
my dad's mouth will explode.

13:30.840 --> 13:32.683
- Yes!
- Which wouldn't be the worst thing.

13:32.800 --> 13:33.881
Yeah. There he is.

13:34.160 --> 13:36.561
There's my Tommy-boy.
Yes!

13:39.800 --> 13:40.881
Hi.

13:41.640 --> 13:43.290
I'm sorry to just--

13:43.760 --> 13:46.445
I was in the neighborhood,
and suddenly I said,

13:46.520 --> 13:48.409
"Oh. This is where Tommy lives."

13:48.960 --> 13:52.965
So, I...
I hope I'm not interrupting.

13:53.080 --> 13:54.650
No.
No, not at all.

13:58.080 --> 13:59.764
Dion, this is Pilar.

14:00.400 --> 14:01.731
Hey, how you doing?

14:02.240 --> 14:04.368
We're in a... a grief group together.

14:04.440 --> 14:07.046
Nice... that you have that in common.

14:07.240 --> 14:08.446
[Pilar chuckles]

14:08.520 --> 14:13.481
So, I was wondering about those,
um, wine ideas.

14:15.040 --> 14:16.644
Oh, right. Yeah. Of course.

14:17.160 --> 14:18.605
Yeah, I just got to, um...

14:18.960 --> 14:21.770
Oh, wait, no. Sorry. Shoot.

14:21.880 --> 14:24.531
L-- I got to go pick up my son
from school.

14:24.600 --> 14:25.806
- So, I--
- [Dion] Tommy, are you kidding me?

14:25.880 --> 14:27.166
Come on, dude. Chill.

14:27.240 --> 14:28.446
Stay here.
I'll go pick him up.

14:28.520 --> 14:29.726
No.
What are you talking about?

14:29.800 --> 14:30.961
Y-- Yeah, yeah.
No, no. I'll go get him.

14:31.040 --> 14:32.485
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'll go!

14:32.720 --> 14:34.768
Dion, whoa!

14:36.240 --> 14:37.526
Right.

14:38.240 --> 14:39.651
And I'll get my jacket.

14:41.920 --> 14:43.649
Thanks.

14:48.080 --> 14:49.127
[door closes]

14:50.880 --> 14:52.120
So...

14:53.240 --> 14:56.050
you're, uh, renovating?

14:57.040 --> 14:59.122
Well, we're, uh,
we're getting ready to.

14:59.640 --> 15:01.688
We're turning this place
into a restaurant.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.331
A restaurant?

15:04.960 --> 15:08.043
- Here?
- Yes. Here in the Bronx.

15:08.360 --> 15:10.328
Wow. That's so...

15:13.160 --> 15:14.525
<i>valiente.</i>

15:16.440 --> 15:17.521
Thank you.

15:18.640 --> 15:21.484
What's the haps, T.J.?

15:22.600 --> 15:23.647
Put it there, man.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.368
Look, your dad's kind of busy,
so I'm gonna be your Uber.

15:28.440 --> 15:31.330
Okay?
All right, come on, get in the car.

15:31.480 --> 15:33.926
Oh, uh, excuse me.
Sir, hi.

15:34.240 --> 15:36.846
Um, I'm T.J.'s school counselor.

15:37.320 --> 15:40.369
I don't remember anyone but his dad
being authorized to pick him up.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.851
I'm Dion Patras.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.005
Tommy brought me on as T.J.'s...
support person.

15:46.640 --> 15:48.085
Su-- support person?

15:48.960 --> 15:52.442
I'm here to try and help the boy
through all of this.

15:52.520 --> 15:54.966
I'll be his ride,
help him with his homework,

15:55.280 --> 16:00.127
give him someone to...
to hang with, while his dad's spiraling.

16:03.160 --> 16:05.766
Well, at least Tommy's reaching
out for some help, right?

16:05.840 --> 16:07.604
- Mm.
- Thank you.

16:07.680 --> 16:08.727
Oh, thank you.

16:11.080 --> 16:12.684
Thank you.

16:22.680 --> 16:24.011
Hey, you know that kid?

16:26.520 --> 16:28.568
I got to make a few stops, uh,

16:28.640 --> 16:30.881
before we head home,
okay, champ?

16:32.120 --> 16:33.406
[grunts]

16:34.720 --> 16:36.529
What, you got something
wrong with your side?

16:38.400 --> 16:40.084
Let me take a look at that.

16:42.240 --> 16:46.768
Aw, Jesus, T.J. someone hit you?

16:51.400 --> 16:53.050
Purple hat do that to you?

16:56.240 --> 16:57.810
Alright, God damn it.

17:01.040 --> 17:02.326
[breathes heavily]

17:04.040 --> 17:06.041
Are you sure you want to
handle this yourself?

17:10.119 --> 17:11.690
[chuckles lightly]
All right.

17:12.440 --> 17:13.885
Good man.

17:14.319 --> 17:15.367
[engine starts]

17:15.560 --> 17:18.086
I told you those five-inch heels
will mess you up.

17:18.160 --> 17:19.207
[both chuckle]

17:21.599 --> 17:23.887
You're supposed to be in Paris.
What the hell happened?

17:24.040 --> 17:25.451
I got no family there.

17:25.760 --> 17:27.204
You're not going to want to hang out here.

17:27.280 --> 17:28.770
Tooth Fairy is upstairs.

17:29.240 --> 17:30.480
Tasha?

17:30.920 --> 17:32.729
Could you get my buddy T.J. here
some snacks?

17:32.800 --> 17:34.450
Come on, T.J.

17:36.560 --> 17:37.607
[chuckles]

17:37.840 --> 17:39.649
I worked out an arrangement
with the Tooth Fairy.

17:39.880 --> 17:41.564
I just got to get
some more cash.

17:42.120 --> 17:45.010
Tommy and I are doing a tasting.
I-- I got to get some more ingredients.

17:45.120 --> 17:47.088
I'm bored already.
Give me a hand.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.445
[man] What do you think you're doing?

17:53.520 --> 17:55.090
You walking out on me?
Get the hell back in there.

17:55.400 --> 17:56.401
I paid for this!

17:56.800 --> 17:58.006
Wait outside.

17:59.480 --> 18:01.847
[woman screams]
[tires screech]

18:03.000 --> 18:04.525
[tires screech, woman screams]

18:05.480 --> 18:07.687
[Crying]
You got your money, bitch.

18:07.960 --> 18:09.325
What the hell does it matter?

18:09.440 --> 18:10.680
What is going on?

18:10.760 --> 18:13.604
Touch her again, asshole,
and your brains are in Yankee Stadium!

18:19.200 --> 18:22.886
I want you and your boy
out of my place.

18:27.160 --> 18:30.562
I think two dignified men
can do better than to have

18:30.640 --> 18:32.768
a throwdown in a musty old whorehouse.

18:36.160 --> 18:38.845
Gave you a little extra
to cover future dental work.

18:42.760 --> 18:44.000
Billy.

19:08.040 --> 19:11.123
[knock on window]
I don't know what arrangement you have

19:11.200 --> 19:14.886
with that Tooth Fairy Polak,
but... be careful, huh?

19:16.080 --> 19:17.286
You're all I got.

19:18.640 --> 19:19.846
You got it.

19:20.400 --> 19:21.447
Thanks.

19:21.720 --> 19:23.882
[engine starts]

19:25.160 --> 19:27.606
Oh, Teej, come here.
Come here. Smell this. [sniffs]

19:27.680 --> 19:29.170
Let's pick a good one.

19:30.200 --> 19:31.326
All right, smell that.

19:33.760 --> 19:37.924
Ah, Mrs. Chung. Look at this.
I like the look of these diver scallops.

19:38.160 --> 19:40.288
You know what, you can lay about
half a dozen on for me, okay?

19:40.360 --> 19:42.840
I'll be back to pick them up.
Come on, you.

19:44.120 --> 19:45.360
Hey, Eduardo.

19:47.120 --> 19:49.122
- Dion. What's up, brother?
- Good, man.

19:49.200 --> 19:52.568
Listen, I need a four-pound rack
of upstate New York lamb. And uh...

19:53.200 --> 19:54.565
You got any spice?

19:59.800 --> 20:01.325
- That's it?
- That's all I got.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.528
My dealer says the Asians
are waiting on a huge shipment.

20:04.040 --> 20:05.326
[Eduardo] Coming in any day.

20:09.400 --> 20:11.289
All right, let's talk lamb.
I got to get cooking.

20:11.360 --> 20:12.486
Teej, come on.

20:13.200 --> 20:16.283
[guitar music plays]

20:23.920 --> 20:25.809
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, Chef.

20:25.880 --> 20:27.530
The secret to cutting a zucchini,

20:27.600 --> 20:30.171
you got to cut it in half,
it keeps it steady, okay?

20:30.440 --> 20:32.886
You don't want to lose a finger.
All right.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.970
[mid-tempo music plays]

21:09.600 --> 21:10.647
[woman laughs]

21:12.160 --> 21:15.323
[both laugh]

21:21.480 --> 21:22.527
All right.

21:23.160 --> 21:25.322
Moderate-plus tannins.
Moderate-plus to high acidity.

21:25.400 --> 21:26.731
Moderate-plus alcohol.

21:26.920 --> 21:29.082
High complexity
with a long finish.

21:29.600 --> 21:30.806
Definitely Old World.

21:30.920 --> 21:32.046
Okay, babe. Keep going.

21:32.520 --> 21:34.284
I'm gonna say Italy, probably Tuscany.

21:34.360 --> 21:35.850
Brunello di Montalcino.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.285
- Right, so?
- Bring it home. Bring it home.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.161
Come on, T, you got this.

21:39.280 --> 21:42.602
I say vintage... 2007.

21:42.680 --> 21:43.727
- Gooooooal!
- Yes!

21:44.640 --> 21:45.687
[Dion] Oh! Oh! Oh, my man!

21:47.320 --> 21:48.481
My man!

21:48.760 --> 21:51.366
- [Dion] You're the best!
- Not bad, not bad.

21:52.520 --> 21:53.760
[Sniffs]

21:56.760 --> 22:00.048
[mid-tempo music plays]

22:12.640 --> 22:14.847
[pan sizzling]
Come here, come here. You hear that?

22:15.080 --> 22:17.287
That sizzle sound?
Hmm?

22:17.360 --> 22:19.727
Now that's the pan talking to me.

22:19.920 --> 22:23.641
Now, remember, a good chef
always listens to his pans.

22:23.720 --> 22:25.848
It'll tell me when the filet's ready

22:25.920 --> 22:28.127
to be turned or the chop
is gonna hit medium-rare.

22:28.400 --> 22:31.290
It's a-- a listening thing.
You got that?

22:31.560 --> 22:32.607
All right, good man.

22:34.040 --> 22:35.610
Oh, well there he is.

22:36.200 --> 22:39.443
Mr. Thomas Moran,
sommelier extraordinaire.

22:41.160 --> 22:42.400
[Dion] You look good, man.

22:42.640 --> 22:46.565
Great idea. Oh, let's, uh,
let's have a toast.

22:46.800 --> 22:49.406
Bringing good luck to this very special,
very important thing--

22:49.480 --> 22:51.084
Are we doing this or not?

22:52.960 --> 22:54.769
Oh, shit, he's early.

22:55.400 --> 22:58.244
Who do I got to screw
to get a meal around here?

22:59.240 --> 23:01.004
Mr. Moran.

23:04.080 --> 23:06.401
T.J., this is your grandfather.

23:08.440 --> 23:10.807
Aidan, this is Thomas Jr.

23:16.320 --> 23:17.765
So, feed me.

23:21.640 --> 23:23.642
All right. We're good. Go.

23:32.640 --> 23:34.847
The 2012 Premier Cru Chablis.

23:35.040 --> 23:37.202
Hints of oyster shell and mineral.

23:37.520 --> 23:38.726
Beautifully suited to be paired--

23:38.800 --> 23:40.086
Just pour.

24:02.640 --> 24:03.687
Abalone.

24:04.160 --> 24:05.605
- Scallop.
- Same difference.

24:05.960 --> 24:07.007
Well, actually, you'll find--

24:07.080 --> 24:08.969
Next course, Chef.

24:12.160 --> 24:13.810
[guitar music plays]

24:15.280 --> 24:17.328
For this,
we recommend an earth-driven

24:17.440 --> 24:20.444
and light-bodied pinot noir
from Vosne-Romanée.

24:28.840 --> 24:30.330
The hell is this, a pigeon?

24:30.520 --> 24:33.251
That is a sous vide quail

24:33.320 --> 24:36.130
with roasted grapes
and a cracked wheat salad.

24:36.200 --> 24:38.521
For all I know,
it's a bird you found up in your attic.

24:38.840 --> 24:40.365
- Yeah, well, with all due respect--
- Chef.

24:40.480 --> 24:42.130
Main course, please.

24:44.240 --> 24:45.605
[Quietly] Right.

24:47.320 --> 24:49.402
Rack of lamb with roasted eggplant

24:49.600 --> 24:51.090
and a kalamata tapenade.

24:51.160 --> 24:53.049
As for pairing, I suggest a traditional

24:53.360 --> 24:55.601
2001 Gran Reserve Rioja.

25:14.880 --> 25:15.927
Delicious.

25:16.840 --> 25:18.569
The food under the fancy.

25:40.800 --> 25:43.849
And to go with your dessert,
a 2005 Sauternes.

25:43.920 --> 25:47.003
Honey-dipped tropical fruits
with notes of vanilla bean.

26:06.720 --> 26:08.802
So... what do you think?

26:10.960 --> 26:12.849
I don't go for this candy-ass crap.

26:14.080 --> 26:18.563
You have no clue what
an incredible meal you just had.

26:18.680 --> 26:20.364
What Dion's cooking--

26:22.800 --> 26:23.847
You're right.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.004
The Bronx is going to gentrify
and get busy real soon,

26:27.080 --> 26:29.765
and all those brave souls
are gonna need to be fed.

26:29.960 --> 26:32.531
May as well eat
at your fancy restaurant...

26:33.400 --> 26:35.209
which I'd own half of.

26:36.960 --> 26:38.530
With one condition;

26:41.280 --> 26:43.681
I get to see my grandson every week.

26:44.320 --> 26:46.527
What? No.

26:46.680 --> 26:48.409
No.
Uh, no, absolutely not.

26:48.520 --> 26:50.522
Can we just discuss this privately,
partner?

26:50.640 --> 26:53.007
- No. No. There's nothing to--
- Yeah, in the kitchen, now.

26:55.160 --> 26:56.924
No way. It's not happening.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.729
Come on,
he's the kid's grandfather.

26:58.800 --> 27:00.484
He's also a racist prick

27:00.600 --> 27:03.410
who's never even bothered
to see his own grandchild,

27:03.480 --> 27:05.209
who, by the way, is black.

27:09.200 --> 27:10.281
What?

27:10.880 --> 27:13.008
I think he's saying he wants to do it.

27:14.520 --> 27:15.681
He doesn't understand.

27:15.760 --> 27:17.524
Maybe your old man has changed.

27:17.680 --> 27:18.727
" [scoffs]
- Huh?

27:19.360 --> 27:23.490
I mean, maybe...
maybe this is his way of reaching out.

27:31.040 --> 27:32.405
All right, we have a deal.

27:32.960 --> 27:35.645
- We'll send over a contract tomorrow.
- Already done.

27:37.040 --> 27:40.249
Nice, yeah. It's, uh, it's efficient.

27:46.960 --> 27:48.644
Yeah, we're gonna give this
a once-over.

27:48.720 --> 27:50.848
We'll send you a signed copy
in the morning.

27:51.760 --> 27:53.888
Hey, and thank you!

27:56.240 --> 27:57.321
[smooches, sighs]

27:57.720 --> 27:59.563
We got ourselves a restaurant.

28:00.040 --> 28:01.530
Living the dream, baby!

28:01.600 --> 28:02.726
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:02.880 --> 28:05.850
My dad didn't get rich by playing fair,
all right?

28:05.920 --> 28:07.331
We got to get someone to look that over.

28:07.480 --> 28:09.164
What do you mean?
Like-- like a lawyer?

28:09.240 --> 28:10.605
It's what you do.

28:12.000 --> 28:15.322
Fine. I got someone. We are so doing this!

28:27.520 --> 28:28.726
What are you doing here?

28:28.800 --> 28:31.201
What? What, now that I'm out of prison,

28:31.280 --> 28:32.486
I can't have contact with you?

28:32.800 --> 28:34.131
Are you a known felon?

28:34.320 --> 28:36.721
[chuckles]
I have company.

28:37.600 --> 28:40.001
There's, uh, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

28:41.920 --> 28:42.967
Which is?

28:43.040 --> 28:46.010
I need, uh...
I need legal advice.

28:46.840 --> 28:48.524
Look, we're about to open up
this restaurant,

28:48.600 --> 28:51.524
and the investor's given us
this massive contract.

28:51.600 --> 28:53.728
Look,
is there any chance you could eyeball it

28:53.800 --> 28:55.609
just to, I don't know,
let us know if it...

28:56.040 --> 28:57.724
I don't know, if it looks okay?

29:00.080 --> 29:02.811
You're just out of prison.
You're broke.

29:03.840 --> 29:05.251
[Marisa] I don't work pro bono.

29:05.960 --> 29:08.884
So, no, there is no chance.

29:09.360 --> 29:10.600
Good night.

29:12.960 --> 29:15.122

29:15.640 --> 29:17.483

Marisa, you coming?

29:18.080 --> 29:19.241
Okay, Dad.

29:20.160 --> 29:22.606
Your mom slaves all afternoon
over her ziti

29:22.680 --> 29:24.762
and you're letting it get cold.
Come on.

29:25.200 --> 29:26.611
Can't you just give it a shot?

29:26.680 --> 29:28.125
What happened to your person?

29:28.200 --> 29:31.204
My person? My person was busy.

29:31.320 --> 29:34.244
She had company. I don't know.
Anyway, besides, it's your turn.

29:35.240 --> 29:36.844
Can't you just call
your little pretty friend?

29:37.040 --> 29:39.088
Pilar manages her sister's restaurant.

29:39.160 --> 29:42.448
She doesn't have time to pore over
every detail of that contract.

29:42.520 --> 29:44.090
Yeah, dude, she does.

29:45.400 --> 29:47.562
Tommy, come on.
Why don't you--

29:47.680 --> 29:50.001
She was "in the neighborhood"?
No,no,no.

29:50.080 --> 29:52.162
People come to this neighborhood
come to score drugs.

29:52.240 --> 29:56.131
And that Pilar chick,
she wants your skinny ass.

29:56.480 --> 29:59.802
Besides, man,
don't you think it's time to, you know,

30:00.520 --> 30:04.809
open your mind to the possibility of...
of meeting a woman.

30:07.080 --> 30:09.162
Pilar, hi. This is Tommy.

30:09.800 --> 30:11.325
From, uh-- the wine guy.

30:11.440 --> 30:13.488
Sorry to bother you.
You're probably super busy.

30:14.120 --> 30:16.805
Kind of, but I can take a break.

30:17.080 --> 30:21.051
Uh, great.
Um, well, you remember, um--

30:21.120 --> 30:23.851
you remember how I-- I told you
that Dion and I were--

30:23.920 --> 30:25.490
were, uh, opening a restaurant?

30:25.560 --> 30:27.528
Yeah. And, uh, good for you.

30:27.640 --> 30:32.441
Yeah, but the thing is the investor has
just dumped this contract on us, right?

30:32.600 --> 30:35.046
And, well, you know,
Dion knows food and I know wine,

30:35.120 --> 30:36.849
but neither of us knows a damn thing

30:36.960 --> 30:38.200
<i>about the legal part of it all.</i>

30:38.280 --> 30:40.681
- Uh-huh.
- So, I was wondering if maybe you--

30:40.760 --> 30:42.524
you might have some time
to kind of look it over.

30:42.880 --> 30:45.850
<i>You know, tell us--
tell us if it seems okay?</i>

30:46.000 --> 30:48.446
...I'll look at your contract, yeah.

30:48.520 --> 30:49.521
Great.

30:50.480 --> 30:51.606
Um... [chuckles]

30:52.440 --> 30:55.364
Uh, do, um,
you want to text me your e-mail?

30:55.440 --> 30:57.488
<i>- Thank you so much.
- No, thank you.</i>

30:58.080 --> 30:59.730
I mean, see you later.

31:00.160 --> 31:01.321
<i>Okay, bye-</i>

31:07.880 --> 31:09.291
[Tommy] Sure you want to do this?

31:09.960 --> 31:11.564
'Cause I can tell him
you changed your mind, you know?

31:11.680 --> 31:14.206
You got-- you got
too much homework, or--

31:26.560 --> 31:29.530
[guitar music plays]

31:40.720 --> 31:42.722
[engine starts]

31:51.320 --> 31:52.560
Exactly why does this guy think

31:52.680 --> 31:53.966
you might be able
to help him with this?

31:54.440 --> 31:57.011
<i>Quién</i> sabe.
I mean, he's starting up a restaurant.

31:57.080 --> 31:58.969
- Mm-hmm.
- I told him I work at one.

31:59.040 --> 32:00.087
Mm-hmm.

32:00.160 --> 32:02.561
So, I guess he just thinks I'm smart.

32:04.160 --> 32:06.083
- It's possible.
- You are smart, mamita.

32:06.160 --> 32:08.162
You're just scattered.
Look, I don't have time for this,

32:08.280 --> 32:10.965
but at a glance, I mean,
there are some things in here

32:11.040 --> 32:13.168
that'll come back to bite
the ass of whoever signs it.

32:13.960 --> 32:15.007
I sure wouldn't.

32:15.400 --> 32:16.765
All right.

32:18.320 --> 32:19.890
[Tommy]
You'll never guess what happened.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.047
It's a funny story.

32:21.400 --> 32:23.209
We ran into my dad.

32:23.440 --> 32:25.602
Yeah. Me and T.J.
Um,

32:26.360 --> 32:29.091
you know, a total accident,
but there he was,

32:29.160 --> 32:31.242
and I sort of had to introduce them.

32:33.200 --> 32:35.248
Believe it or not, they--
they hit it off.

32:37.520 --> 32:40.091
T.J. said he'd like to
spend some time with him,

32:40.160 --> 32:42.049
and my dad didn't seem to mind,

32:42.120 --> 32:44.964
so, I guess it's like you always said.

32:45.520 --> 32:48.205
Even a crusty old racist like my father

32:48.320 --> 32:50.527
can't resist that boy's beautiful face.

32:51.800 --> 32:52.847
You were right.

32:54.440 --> 32:55.487
Again.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.286
You got to pee?

33:30.640 --> 33:32.563
The bathroom's through the kitchen.

33:36.200 --> 33:37.850
[siren wails, horns honking]

33:38.600 --> 33:39.647
[Pilar] Hello?

33:41.520 --> 33:42.646
Tommy?

33:44.240 --> 33:45.571
<i>Hola.</i>

33:47.040 --> 33:50.761
Oh, hi.
I was looking for-- How are you?

33:50.880 --> 33:54.089
I'm good.
You know, Tommy's-- Tommy's not here.

33:54.400 --> 33:55.925
Okay. Urn, I'll--

33:56.040 --> 33:57.929
Wait, wait, wait, is that--
is that the contract?

33:58.560 --> 34:01.291
How's it look? I mean, we all good?

34:01.960 --> 34:04.725
Well, actually,
there's some issues with it.

34:04.800 --> 34:07.087
Oh, like what?
Give me an example.

34:07.760 --> 34:12.971
Well, like, it doesn't specifically say
the name of the restaurant,

34:13.080 --> 34:14.969
and the location is kind of unclear.

34:15.040 --> 34:16.963
No contract is perfect, all right?

34:17.800 --> 34:19.723
You know,
and a lot of these issues,

34:19.800 --> 34:23.485
they, uh-- they go away over time.

34:25.440 --> 34:28.091
I just think Tommy
should be aware that it's, uh,

34:28.159 --> 34:31.687
not a good contract,
and you guys shouldn't sign it.

34:31.880 --> 34:35.646
Look, I get the distinct impression
that you like Tommy.

34:36.800 --> 34:40.121
If so, then you probably
give a shit about what's good for him.

34:41.159 --> 34:43.447
...guy lost his wife.

34:45.120 --> 34:46.167
Now his kid's a mute.

34:46.239 --> 34:49.449
The guy's life's been in a nose dive for,
like, a year.

34:49.719 --> 34:51.210
These past few days,

34:51.840 --> 34:53.763
I've been seeing signs of the old Tommy.

34:54.560 --> 34:57.848
I mean, this whole restaurant
idea's really got his...

34:58.760 --> 35:02.560
his blood pumping again,
which is a good thing.

35:03.960 --> 35:06.247
If you want to bring all that
crashing down,

35:07.640 --> 35:09.802
send him back into his damn rut,

35:10.520 --> 35:11.965
crush his dream...

35:15.120 --> 35:17.487
that's entirely on you.

35:25.240 --> 35:26.765
I just think he should know.

35:29.920 --> 35:33.003
[guitar music plays]

35:56.920 --> 35:58.251
What are you doing in here?

35:58.520 --> 36:00.966
I didn't say you could wander around.
Get in the kitchen.

36:01.280 --> 36:02.930
Jensen made you a sandwich.

36:06.960 --> 36:08.689
But it's still the same.

it goes back there to the boys

36:16.480 --> 36:17.561

36:18.920 --> 36:20.570
To my friends.

36:22.400 --> 36:25.370
Good. Uh, anybody-- anybody else?
Anybody else want to share?

36:25.880 --> 36:27.211
Tommy, how about you?

36:27.480 --> 36:30.051
Uh...Okay.

36:30.120 --> 36:33.010
I mean, I guess that things are
pretty much the same.

36:33.080 --> 36:36.084
- Mm-hmm.
- Actually, not really.

36:37.720 --> 36:39.688
Just felt weird
not to start off that way.

36:39.960 --> 36:41.007
[laughter]

36:41.480 --> 36:43.562
Lately there's been
a lot of things thrown at me.

36:44.760 --> 36:48.207
Changes.
Urn, and it's made me feel...

36:49.760 --> 36:51.922
Well, that's just it. it--
It's made me feel.

36:52.360 --> 36:55.204
You know, the last few days,
I haven't woken up depressed.

36:55.760 --> 37:00.368
It's like I'm just starting
to shake off this-- this fog.

37:01.960 --> 37:03.405
[Tommy] I think my son sees that.

37:03.760 --> 37:06.206
It's important to me that--
that when he looks at me,

37:06.280 --> 37:07.850
he doesn't see zombie dad.

37:08.560 --> 37:12.281
You know, he sees...
he sees his father.

37:21.360 --> 37:22.521
I'm really happy for you.

37:22.640 --> 37:25.405
Sounds like you're... optimistic.

37:25.800 --> 37:28.531
Well, optimistic adjacent.

37:28.920 --> 37:29.967

37:31.680 --> 37:33.808
Hey, did you, uh,
did you read the contract?

37:35.000 --> 37:37.970
- I did.
- What'd you think?

- Hello.
- God!

Don't you want to celebrate?

to tell me all the bad things
he's ever done.

It doesn't work like that.

38:45.800 --> 38:46.847

What do you mean?

some rules.

41:47.960 --> 41:51.487
son of a bitch

41:51.560 --> 41:53.801
