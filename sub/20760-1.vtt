WEBVTT

00:41.830 --> 00:43.796
Where are you right now?

00:50.805 --> 00:53.572
Let me start at the beginning.

00:55.535 --> 00:57.290
The beginning...

00:57.787 --> 00:59.153
Three years ago,

00:59.178 --> 01:01.203
I sent a traveler back in time

01:01.228 --> 01:02.781
to stop a plague...

01:02.806 --> 01:05.829
that had killed 7 billion people.

01:06.535 --> 01:08.150
The mission was clear:

01:08.175 --> 01:10.689
kill the man responsible
for destroying the world

01:10.713 --> 01:13.347
before he has a chance to do so...

01:14.683 --> 01:16.149
Change history

01:16.151 --> 01:18.658
and save the future.

01:19.054 --> 01:21.288
But as fate would have it,

01:21.290 --> 01:23.323
we were hunting the wrong man.

01:23.325 --> 01:26.241
- You're still here.
- How is that possible?

01:27.062 --> 01:28.361
We changed course

01:28.363 --> 01:29.729
and recruited others

01:29.731 --> 01:31.686
to help us on our mission.

01:32.008 --> 01:34.561
Bonds were forged with allies,

01:34.586 --> 01:36.269
mutual enemies,

01:36.271 --> 01:38.004
and even those of...

01:38.006 --> 01:39.239
unsound mind.

01:40.842 --> 01:42.273
And together,

01:42.298 --> 01:46.351
we discovered a conspiracy
spanning centuries:

01:46.915 --> 01:50.171
the Army of the 12 Monkeys...

01:50.919 --> 01:52.319
an organization bent on

01:52.321 --> 01:55.455
not only the destruction of humankind,

01:55.457 --> 01:58.663
but time itself.

01:59.581 --> 02:03.774
A cult operating by
fierce religious devotion

02:03.799 --> 02:05.298
to the word of its prophet...

02:05.300 --> 02:07.000
Mother!

02:07.025 --> 02:08.967
A man from the future...

02:08.993 --> 02:10.893
who calls himself...

02:10.918 --> 02:12.366
the Witness.

02:13.757 --> 02:17.210
The world's end, an
infinite hell on Earth,

02:17.212 --> 02:19.444
are by his design.

02:19.905 --> 02:22.148
And now, our mission to stop him

02:22.150 --> 02:24.317
has come at a tremendous cost.

02:26.788 --> 02:27.787
Cole!

02:27.789 --> 02:28.989
Cassie!

02:30.926 --> 02:34.358
Our friends are lost in time.

02:34.753 --> 02:36.648
Come on, Cassie.

02:37.288 --> 02:38.798
She's gone.

02:38.800 --> 02:41.167
Where did she go?

02:41.169 --> 02:44.237
Our only clue to their
disappearance is a year:

02:44.239 --> 02:46.405
2163.

02:47.042 --> 02:50.085
A when without a where.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.868
For months, we've searched the wasteland

02:52.901 --> 02:54.837
for the enemy's machine,

02:54.862 --> 02:56.362
Titan,

02:56.387 --> 02:58.218
chasing its temporal signature.

03:00.756 --> 03:04.230
Scouring the planet, we found nothing.

03:04.255 --> 03:06.493
Initiate return sequence.

03:06.495 --> 03:09.329
And for our traveler, James Cole,

03:09.331 --> 03:12.165
I fear this is no
longer a rescue mission,

03:12.167 --> 03:14.396
but something else...

03:15.470 --> 03:17.203
the hopeless endeavor of a man

03:17.205 --> 03:20.471
desperate to save someone he lost,

03:20.859 --> 03:23.878
someone he loves.

03:25.380 --> 03:26.946
And with each passing day,

03:26.948 --> 03:29.082
hope becomes a distant memory.

03:37.292 --> 03:39.159
How can we defeat an enemy

03:39.161 --> 03:41.331
from our own future?

03:42.197 --> 03:46.433
Time is no longer on our side.

04:49.567 --> 04:52.112
How much longer you want to do this?

04:57.973 --> 04:59.830
Mr. Cole.

05:03.372 --> 05:05.445
Mr. Cole.

05:11.431 --> 05:13.634
- James.
- What?

05:14.890 --> 05:16.666
It's time.

05:17.292 --> 05:19.813
- You and I both know...
- I'm not stopping.

05:22.720 --> 05:25.431
Your loyalty is distracting
you from the truth.

05:25.433 --> 05:27.233
We need to move on.

05:27.235 --> 05:29.197
It's been months.

05:29.222 --> 05:31.504
I've watched you killing yourself...

05:31.506 --> 05:33.097
slowly.

05:33.738 --> 05:35.623
And I stood aside, and I helped.

05:35.648 --> 05:37.314
I can find her.

05:37.339 --> 05:39.439
Dr. Railly isn't the mission.

05:39.464 --> 05:41.915
She never was, and she never
would have wanted to be.

05:41.917 --> 05:44.035
What about Ramse, then? Jennifer?

05:44.060 --> 05:46.421
- They neither.
- What is it then? Huh, Jones?

05:46.446 --> 05:47.954
What is the mission now?

05:47.956 --> 05:50.861
Stopping the Witness, the plague!

05:50.886 --> 05:52.626
Learning Titan's true purpose!

05:52.627 --> 05:54.661
Same bullshit, over and over again.

05:54.663 --> 05:56.162
We may not find our friends,

05:56.164 --> 05:57.897
but we can still save them.

05:57.899 --> 05:59.793
We can save everyone!

06:01.670 --> 06:03.787
I'm going back there.

06:03.812 --> 06:05.792
The hell you are.

06:08.562 --> 06:09.694
Move.

06:09.719 --> 06:11.252
You are a rabid dog.

06:11.277 --> 06:13.646
Don't make me put you down.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.965
The sensor that I planted...

06:18.990 --> 06:21.998
on the bridge outside Syracuse...

06:22.023 --> 06:24.524
there was a... a spike
in the temporal energy.

06:24.526 --> 06:26.559
- Then it went dark.
- It might've found Titan.

06:26.561 --> 06:29.462
Or found nothing... a
hiccup in the time stream.

06:29.464 --> 06:31.431
We need to know that!

06:33.501 --> 06:35.068
I need to know that.

06:38.173 --> 06:39.572
If there's even a chance...

06:39.574 --> 06:42.375
You are malnourished, dehydrated.

06:42.377 --> 06:45.178
You haven't slept in months.

06:45.180 --> 06:48.424
James, we have lost so many already.

06:50.309 --> 06:52.276
I'm not gonna die on you.

06:53.872 --> 06:55.805
I can find them.

06:59.308 --> 07:00.901
All right.

07:01.691 --> 07:03.524
But you're not going alone.

07:05.667 --> 07:07.267
Oh!

07:55.684 --> 07:57.383
I'm not going anywhere.

07:57.385 --> 07:59.385
I have responsibilities here.

07:59.410 --> 08:01.996
The security of this
facility, to my sisters...

08:02.021 --> 08:03.690
We're losing Mr. Cole.

08:03.692 --> 08:05.901
I need someone to keep an eye on him.

08:05.926 --> 08:07.393
A reconnaissance mission only.

08:07.395 --> 08:09.462
I'm not getting in your machine.

08:09.464 --> 08:11.030
It's caused enough damage.

08:11.032 --> 08:12.981
Don't be a little shit.

08:13.637 --> 08:15.635
I'm not one of your
soldiers to be ordered.

08:15.637 --> 08:18.404
Or my daughter to be told, apparently.

08:18.406 --> 08:21.274
- That's not what I meant.
- Then say what you mean.

08:23.906 --> 08:25.817
I went to Titan for Moth...

08:27.816 --> 08:29.415
Jennifer.

08:29.417 --> 08:30.750
She's gone.

08:30.752 --> 08:33.028
This is not my mission.
I don't believe in it.

08:33.053 --> 08:34.287
Yet here you are,

08:34.289 --> 08:37.657
standing before me,
alive... my daughter.

08:37.659 --> 08:40.126
This mission saved your life.

08:40.128 --> 08:43.162
Mr. Cole saved your life.

08:43.164 --> 08:44.770
Please.

08:45.467 --> 08:47.500
I only want you to be his guardian,

08:47.502 --> 08:49.096
to protect him.

08:49.121 --> 08:50.403
From who?

08:50.405 --> 08:51.871
There's no one left in 2163.

08:51.873 --> 08:53.339
It's a dead world.

08:53.341 --> 08:57.098
The greatest danger to
Mr. Cole is Mr. Cole.

08:57.123 --> 08:59.645
I need to protect him from himself.

09:00.181 --> 09:02.081
Initiate splinter sequence.

09:06.721 --> 09:09.422
And if James doesn't want to be saved?

09:09.424 --> 09:11.157
Then you'll stick him with this.

09:11.159 --> 09:13.084
And you'll bring him home.

09:14.429 --> 09:16.295
Match coordinates.

09:22.281 --> 09:24.837
- Follow sequence.
- Powering up.

09:38.319 --> 09:39.653
Try and keep up.

09:39.678 --> 09:41.888
I prefer to be where I can see you.

09:42.969 --> 09:45.858
Something tells me you're the
one I should keep an eye on.

09:45.860 --> 09:47.692
You don't trust me now either?

09:47.717 --> 09:50.217
I don't trust what you've become.

09:50.765 --> 09:53.092
You know, we can hear you at night.

09:53.117 --> 09:55.401
Drinking mother's red
tea in your quarters.

09:55.403 --> 09:57.336
The screaming.

09:57.338 --> 09:58.538
It's not working, is it?

09:58.540 --> 10:00.239
The Witness is always there.

10:00.241 --> 10:01.774
It worked once.

10:01.776 --> 10:04.194
Maybe because he wanted it to.

10:04.879 --> 10:06.289
Maybe.

10:07.143 --> 10:09.077
It could kill you, James.

10:09.102 --> 10:10.881
Or do you even care anymore?

10:10.906 --> 10:12.952
The hell's that supposed to mean?

10:12.954 --> 10:14.754
You're different now...

10:14.756 --> 10:17.757
unwilling to face the hard
choices in front of you.

10:17.759 --> 10:21.494
Hey, you have no idea the
choices I've had to make.

10:40.615 --> 10:42.116
There it is.

10:43.918 --> 10:45.426
What?

10:46.554 --> 10:48.321
No, no.

10:48.323 --> 10:50.605
No, no, no, no, no.

10:50.630 --> 10:52.605
There's no power.

10:53.251 --> 10:55.754
We came all this way for a dead battery?

10:57.309 --> 10:58.637
Come on!

11:01.803 --> 11:04.337
We'll set up camp and wait for
the machine to bring us back.

11:04.339 --> 11:06.130
No, we won't.

11:08.543 --> 11:11.010
It's over, James. I'm not asking.

11:18.553 --> 11:21.000
I'd be very careful if I was you.

11:21.025 --> 11:22.828
It's time to go home.

11:23.658 --> 11:26.826
- I'm not going anywhere.
- You'll do as I say.

11:33.735 --> 11:35.648
Temporal signature.

11:36.804 --> 11:38.004
Titan?

11:38.006 --> 11:39.641
We found it.

11:48.658 --> 11:50.393
Jesus, you're just like your mother.

11:50.395 --> 11:51.523
Last time we went to Titan,

11:51.548 --> 11:53.164
we had an army, and
we were almost killed.

11:53.189 --> 11:55.500
- There's only two of us.
- If we don't go there now,

11:55.525 --> 11:57.572
- we could lose it forever!
- That's suicide!

11:57.597 --> 11:59.351
Cassie, Ramse, Jennifer.

11:59.376 --> 12:00.608
This could be our only chance.

12:00.633 --> 12:02.906
Or we could get them all killed.

12:02.931 --> 12:05.665
We should return to the
facility and formulate a plan.

12:05.667 --> 12:07.539
You go do that, then.

12:41.001 --> 12:42.702
Stay down.

12:45.300 --> 12:47.072
Jones give you that?

12:50.712 --> 12:52.078
Say hi to your mother for me.

12:52.080 --> 12:53.384
You little sh...

13:15.703 --> 13:17.462
Cassie...

14:06.535 --> 14:09.144
The Mother must eat.

14:09.942 --> 14:11.463
I'm not hungry.

14:15.870 --> 14:17.303
You must nourish the child

14:17.305 --> 14:19.171
growing in your belly.

14:22.224 --> 14:23.887
Please.

14:24.545 --> 14:27.020
You need to keep up your strength.

14:30.908 --> 14:32.395
Leave us.

14:40.494 --> 14:42.358
A confession...

14:42.420 --> 14:44.108
if I may.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.633
It seems to me that only yesterday,

14:47.635 --> 14:49.068
you were willing to...

14:49.070 --> 14:50.851
harm anyone who came close to you,

14:50.876 --> 14:53.936
and I was concerned that
you were incapable of change.

14:55.676 --> 14:57.387
And now look at you.

14:57.834 --> 14:59.481
Glowing.

15:00.248 --> 15:02.012
Domesticated.

15:03.340 --> 15:05.832
Please... eat.

15:08.122 --> 15:12.332
You know, today is the
most special of occasions.

15:14.295 --> 15:16.062
Your unveiling.

15:16.734 --> 15:19.632
A chance to show the faithful
that the Witness is safe

15:19.634 --> 15:22.134
and growing strong inside you.

15:22.453 --> 15:25.101
And a chance for you to
show your love for him.

15:25.761 --> 15:27.780
He's mine.

15:27.805 --> 15:29.441
Why wouldn't I?

15:29.443 --> 15:31.164
You've shown doubt.

15:31.612 --> 15:33.515
Because I fear for him.

15:33.965 --> 15:37.299
Love for the child
inside you is incidental.

15:37.324 --> 15:41.385
The love you must show
is for the man he becomes.

15:42.186 --> 15:44.186
You should be honored.

15:44.211 --> 15:46.932
The Witness chose you as his...

15:47.395 --> 15:48.827
vessel.

15:50.264 --> 15:52.385
For decades, I've waited.

15:52.410 --> 15:55.048
It is a remarkable thing

15:55.073 --> 15:58.270
to be raised to raise a child.

15:59.978 --> 16:02.588
Shaped in order to shape.

16:04.737 --> 16:06.775
Taught to teach.

16:08.683 --> 16:10.416
I'm his mother.

16:10.418 --> 16:11.783
Hmm.

16:14.050 --> 16:17.041
The mother is not the
belly that bears the child,

16:17.960 --> 16:20.059
but the hands that cradle,

16:20.061 --> 16:22.494
the voice that soothes the crying,

16:22.496 --> 16:24.997
the face it sees...

16:24.999 --> 16:27.247
and thinks to itself...

16:33.140 --> 16:34.866
"Love."

16:53.427 --> 16:55.294
Mind yourself.

17:16.617 --> 17:19.050
Mr. Cole's tether has been activated.

17:27.795 --> 17:29.128
Hannah!

17:32.133 --> 17:33.699
We found Titan.

17:33.701 --> 17:35.601
James is going in on his own.

17:35.603 --> 17:38.170
- Bring him back!
- We can't.

17:38.172 --> 17:39.638
The machine thinks we already did!

17:39.640 --> 17:40.839
We'll have to reboot the system

17:40.841 --> 17:42.474
in order to establish connection...

17:42.476 --> 17:43.812
Hurry!

17:43.837 --> 17:45.602
Goddamn it!

17:57.469 --> 17:59.436
You're tense.

17:59.438 --> 18:00.785
Don't be.

18:00.810 --> 18:02.744
All will be fine.

18:05.120 --> 18:07.288
You've always been kind to me, Arianna.

18:07.313 --> 18:09.314
Well, why would I not be?

18:10.048 --> 18:11.615
You're a follower of the Witness.

18:11.617 --> 18:13.345
I'm just a vessel.

18:13.531 --> 18:16.150
Magdalena said so herself.

18:18.836 --> 18:21.134
I believe in the Witness...

18:21.159 --> 18:23.642
because it's all I've ever known.

18:24.697 --> 18:26.853
You were raised in Titan?

18:28.111 --> 18:31.478
I was taken from my parents
when I was a child...

18:32.972 --> 18:35.199
from a time long past.

18:37.420 --> 18:39.745
I miss my family too.

18:47.197 --> 18:49.347
This belonged to my mother.

18:50.467 --> 18:51.766
When I'm feeling lonely,

18:51.768 --> 18:55.205
I rub it between my fingers.

18:55.230 --> 18:57.191
It's very soothing.

18:58.600 --> 19:00.166
Take it.

19:03.638 --> 19:06.406
- No, I can't.
- Please.

19:06.408 --> 19:09.424
All mothers are important.

19:18.507 --> 19:21.150
You never speak of the child's father.

19:24.027 --> 19:26.092
His name was James.

19:28.370 --> 19:31.264
He doesn't even know that I'm...

19:31.266 --> 19:33.181
Was he kind?

19:36.304 --> 19:38.171
You miss him?

19:41.835 --> 19:43.610
I want to go home.

20:14.543 --> 20:16.183
What the hell are you?

20:18.547 --> 20:20.335
Shit.

20:35.345 --> 20:36.842
Ugh!

20:44.347 --> 20:46.714
Argh! Ow!

21:02.891 --> 21:04.741
What the hell?

21:06.552 --> 21:08.826
- Will not question...
- The truth of Titan.

21:08.851 --> 21:10.944
Its mystery is a testament to our faith.

21:10.969 --> 21:12.836
Or the betrayal of our trust.

21:12.861 --> 21:14.699
We don't demand of it answers.

21:14.724 --> 21:16.630
There's another traveler.

21:16.655 --> 21:19.499
Not inside, but close.

21:20.851 --> 21:23.967
James Cole has finally found us.

21:24.455 --> 21:26.897
The Mother's unveiling
will have to wait.

21:29.059 --> 21:31.272
Initiate splinter sequence.

21:33.768 --> 21:35.371
Where are we going?

21:35.396 --> 21:37.064
To the Red Theater.

21:41.771 --> 21:43.781
- We must return.
- What's happening?

21:43.806 --> 21:45.597
Titan is leaving this time.

21:45.622 --> 21:47.096
Come on.

22:18.387 --> 22:20.250
I'm not gonna hurt you.

22:21.543 --> 22:23.242
I can get you back to your family

22:23.267 --> 22:25.399
if you help me get back to mine.

22:27.758 --> 22:29.261
Arianna,

22:29.263 --> 22:31.313
if you love the Witness...

22:31.998 --> 22:34.243
help me save him from them.

22:38.433 --> 22:39.732
Okay.

22:39.757 --> 22:41.783
Do you know the way out of here?

22:41.808 --> 22:43.393
Yes.

22:43.418 --> 22:44.918
This way.

22:44.943 --> 22:46.476
Come.

23:04.832 --> 23:06.535
Which way?

23:15.342 --> 23:16.842
Shh.

23:22.560 --> 23:24.927
- The Mother?
- Find her.

23:26.522 --> 23:28.152
Now!

23:38.037 --> 23:39.378
Are you ready?

23:41.201 --> 23:42.957
Yes.

23:44.030 --> 23:46.730
Ahh! Ah!

23:47.151 --> 23:49.199
- Arianna, get up!
- Go!

23:50.344 --> 23:51.677
- Go.
- Get up, now!

23:51.679 --> 23:53.178
I won't make it! Go!

24:02.856 --> 24:04.347
No.

24:14.862 --> 24:17.511
I found Mr. Cole, but
this doesn't make sense.

24:17.536 --> 24:20.038
- What is it?
- I've got multiple signatures here.

24:20.040 --> 24:22.214
Splinter radiation off the scale!

24:22.239 --> 24:23.824
Titan...

24:30.465 --> 24:31.644
Cole.

24:31.669 --> 24:32.847
Cole!

24:37.479 --> 24:39.168
James Cole.

24:39.193 --> 24:40.785
Cassie!

24:47.928 --> 24:49.328
Cole!

24:52.769 --> 24:54.136
Cole?

25:12.240 --> 25:13.635
No.

25:13.660 --> 25:15.827
Gone. We've lost his tether.

25:15.829 --> 25:17.564
Where did he go?

25:29.277 --> 25:30.792
The Emerson.

25:32.121 --> 25:34.146
Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy.

25:34.148 --> 25:35.947
Who are you?

25:40.487 --> 25:42.020
That's right.

25:42.193 --> 25:43.941
Take it all in.

25:45.092 --> 25:47.042
Greetings, asshole.

25:47.428 --> 25:49.324
I'm future asshole.

26:10.095 --> 26:11.782
I'm so sorry.

26:11.813 --> 26:13.500
It's not your fault.

26:13.774 --> 26:15.540
Go.

26:15.565 --> 26:16.969
Go!

26:17.867 --> 26:19.672
No!

26:26.405 --> 26:27.771
She was right there!

26:27.773 --> 26:29.606
I could see her! I could've saved her!

26:29.608 --> 26:32.042
No, you would've been killed.

26:32.044 --> 26:33.704
We would've been killed?

26:33.729 --> 26:35.771
I'd rather die trying.

26:35.796 --> 26:37.703
Trust me, I remember.

26:37.728 --> 26:39.265
All this...

26:39.885 --> 26:42.264
except the kick to the nut sack.

26:42.289 --> 26:44.710
I really should've remembered that one.

26:45.374 --> 26:47.531
This should be impossible.

26:47.712 --> 26:49.117
I know.

26:49.656 --> 26:51.218
It's crazy, right?

26:51.243 --> 26:53.054
I mean, I'm a little surprised
it hasn't happened sooner.

26:53.079 --> 26:55.065
Use the subway in the
same city long enough,

26:55.067 --> 26:57.067
you're bound to run into each other.

26:57.069 --> 26:58.669
How is this not a paradox?

26:58.671 --> 27:01.071
Oh, uh... this helps with that.

27:01.073 --> 27:02.639
That's a machine?

27:02.641 --> 27:05.804
No, this is just what we
all wear in the future.

27:06.179 --> 27:08.054
Yeah, it's a machine.

27:09.710 --> 27:12.511
Hey, don't get touchy.

27:13.852 --> 27:15.919
Jesus, maybe we should shave.

27:15.921 --> 27:17.854
Oh, nice. That's funny.

27:17.856 --> 27:19.990
Thanks. I remember that one, too.

27:19.992 --> 27:23.060
All right, you had your
fun. You got some shots in.

27:23.062 --> 27:25.339
Now tell me what I need to know.

27:25.364 --> 27:26.800
Okay.

27:29.034 --> 27:30.283
What do you need to know?

27:30.308 --> 27:32.969
Jesus Christ, you came to me!

27:32.971 --> 27:34.971
Cassie, Ramse... you know more than me,

27:34.973 --> 27:37.774
so let's hear it, future asshole!

27:37.776 --> 27:39.242
- Jones is right.
- About what?

27:39.244 --> 27:41.580
- You are a rabid dog.
- Okay.

27:41.605 --> 27:44.181
- You're blind.
- I'm blind.

27:44.183 --> 27:45.782
Then tell me what I'm missing.

27:45.784 --> 27:47.440
Tell me the future.

27:47.886 --> 27:49.471
Jennifer.

27:50.189 --> 27:51.822
Jennifer Goines?

27:52.283 --> 27:53.885
Turns out the key to the universe

27:53.910 --> 27:56.111
is chock full of nuts.

27:56.240 --> 27:58.494
- You need her.
- All right.

27:58.764 --> 28:00.464
Then let's go get her.
Jump me back to Titan.

28:00.466 --> 28:02.833
Christ's sakes, can't
you formulate a plan

28:02.835 --> 28:04.034
for once in your life?

28:04.036 --> 28:06.970
- Are you shitting me?
- Just listen.

28:06.972 --> 28:08.739
Jennifer's not in Titan.

28:09.182 --> 28:10.907
She's lost in time.

28:10.909 --> 28:12.109
Way back.

28:12.111 --> 28:14.077
Locked away somewhere inside

28:14.079 --> 28:17.055
that Primary pinball
machine brain of hers

28:17.080 --> 28:19.082
is the answer to everything:

28:19.084 --> 28:21.818
the plague, Titan, Ath...

28:21.820 --> 28:23.377
Who?

28:23.712 --> 28:25.783
The Jinn, the Witness...

28:26.227 --> 28:27.440
all of it.

28:27.465 --> 28:29.131
All right.

28:29.261 --> 28:30.752
Where is she?

28:31.730 --> 28:33.415
When is she?

28:33.440 --> 28:35.832
You're gonna want to
brush up on your French.

28:39.535 --> 28:42.666
Madame! Madame!

28:43.876 --> 28:45.760
Regardez-moi.

28:45.785 --> 28:47.049
Ecoutez.

28:51.778 --> 28:54.117
Yes, yes. Oui, oui.

29:02.895 --> 29:04.694
German, German.

29:25.184 --> 29:26.783
Oh, yeah.

29:28.086 --> 29:29.533
Yeah!

29:30.088 --> 29:31.479
Much better!

29:54.213 --> 29:56.658
♪ 99 Luftballons! ♪

30:29.248 --> 30:30.881
Oh, no.

30:30.906 --> 30:32.662
You Germans smoke a lot.

30:33.118 --> 30:34.553
You are American?

30:34.578 --> 30:36.086
How did you come here?

30:36.088 --> 30:39.055
I accidentally shot a time machine.

30:40.792 --> 30:43.460
Ugh! Stupid.

30:45.898 --> 30:47.330
Here I am.

31:02.347 --> 31:03.678
The Horsemen.

31:11.954 --> 31:14.467
I think you might be crazy person.

31:14.492 --> 31:16.116
Phone home.

31:17.469 --> 31:18.889
Phone home.

31:18.914 --> 31:21.174
I need to get a message to my friends.

31:21.199 --> 31:23.045
They need to know. They need to know!

31:23.070 --> 31:25.788
- They need to know!
- Need to know what?

31:26.737 --> 31:28.694
It all starts here...

31:29.586 --> 31:30.785
In the past.

31:34.670 --> 31:35.936
They're coming. They're coming.

31:35.961 --> 31:37.147
Who?

31:37.172 --> 31:38.600
Four of them!

31:38.625 --> 31:40.892
Apocalypse... it's here!

31:40.917 --> 31:42.796
Yeah! Horsemen... no horses.

31:44.057 --> 31:45.084
Horsemen... no horses.

31:45.109 --> 31:46.974
Horsemen! Right!

31:46.999 --> 31:48.832
Horsemen of the Apocalypse!

31:50.395 --> 31:53.076
The Horsemen of the Apocalypse!

31:59.286 --> 32:01.578
Jennifer's in 1922.

32:02.672 --> 32:04.805
- That's Cassie's watch.
- Hey.

32:04.843 --> 32:06.443
The suit helps with paradoxes.

32:06.468 --> 32:08.109
It doesn't stop them.

32:08.888 --> 32:10.594
Why are you wearing that?

32:14.724 --> 32:16.718
What aren't you telling me?

32:20.579 --> 32:22.546
What happens to her?

32:22.571 --> 32:26.473
The Witness, conceived out of time

32:26.498 --> 32:29.077
in the house of cedar and pine.

32:29.102 --> 32:31.311
Born of two travelers...

32:32.308 --> 32:35.142
he who hath ensured his own creation,

32:35.144 --> 32:38.147
despite the father's
attempt to undo him.

32:38.714 --> 32:39.992
The blood...

32:40.993 --> 32:43.117
the travel serum in both
the mother and the father...

32:43.142 --> 32:46.297
miraculous beyond words.

32:46.985 --> 32:49.430
And soon, the coming of the Witness

32:49.455 --> 32:51.250
shall be upon us.

32:51.761 --> 32:53.861
And then his return
to Titan, as promised,

32:53.863 --> 32:57.664
where he shall lead us to
the forest of red forever.

32:58.188 --> 33:00.031
The Witness is safe.

33:00.056 --> 33:01.235
The Witness is safe.

33:01.260 --> 33:03.581
The Witness is safe.

33:03.606 --> 33:05.821
The Witness is safe.

33:10.111 --> 33:11.779
What happens to her?

33:11.781 --> 33:13.847
I can't tell you.

33:16.408 --> 33:18.205
Cassandra, no!

33:20.256 --> 33:21.822
Stay back.

33:25.839 --> 33:28.859
Don't do this, Cassandra. Come down.

33:28.884 --> 33:31.242
Stay back!

33:38.071 --> 33:40.650
- Are you prepared?
- I'm prepared.

33:42.247 --> 33:45.189
Wouldn't you rather live
in your son's admiration

33:45.214 --> 33:48.251
than his scorn for this selfish act?

33:48.678 --> 33:50.678
He'll never have to know.

33:53.289 --> 33:55.355
Why won't you tell me?

33:55.357 --> 33:57.598
What happens to her?

33:58.561 --> 34:00.192
Cassandra.

34:00.956 --> 34:02.809
If I jump...

34:03.532 --> 34:05.192
this all ends now.

34:05.217 --> 34:07.418
Me, you...

34:09.737 --> 34:11.628
You'll never get him.

34:11.652 --> 34:14.052
No, you don't understand.

34:14.077 --> 34:16.210
We don't make him.

34:16.212 --> 34:18.312
He makes us.

34:18.313 --> 34:21.043
The Witness is exactly
who he wishes to be.

34:21.069 --> 34:22.969
It's already happened

34:22.994 --> 34:24.567
and will again...

34:24.592 --> 34:26.918
a beautiful cycle.

34:27.277 --> 34:29.010
How do we save her?

34:30.341 --> 34:32.759
- We don't.
- Don't say that.

34:32.761 --> 34:36.121
Don't say that. We can always
go back, do it over again.

34:36.147 --> 34:37.763
No.

34:38.199 --> 34:40.138
Everything we've done...

34:41.937 --> 34:45.271
all our sins...

34:45.774 --> 34:47.741
they're written.

34:47.743 --> 34:51.074
You're frightened. I understand.

34:51.099 --> 34:55.091
But we can rejoice in
this miracle together.

34:55.116 --> 34:56.984
It's fate.

34:56.985 --> 34:58.418
Yours.

34:59.153 --> 35:00.419
Ours.

35:02.658 --> 35:04.458
Does she die?

35:07.117 --> 35:09.140
That's up to her.

35:12.468 --> 35:14.180
Cassandra.

35:24.713 --> 35:26.446
You can't have him.

35:28.622 --> 35:30.194
No, Cassandra!

35:57.479 --> 35:59.285
The Mother must eat.

36:04.753 --> 36:07.487
You must nourish the child
growing in your belly.

36:07.489 --> 36:09.112
What's happening?

36:09.137 --> 36:10.891
Oh, you...

36:10.893 --> 36:12.559
oh, here.

36:21.983 --> 36:23.147
- No!
- Don't.

36:23.172 --> 36:24.889
No!

36:27.509 --> 36:29.389
You haven't changed.

36:38.199 --> 36:39.760
Oh, dear.

36:40.990 --> 36:43.377
How did you do this?

36:44.104 --> 36:45.682
Magdalena.

36:48.137 --> 36:49.682
She came back in time and warned us

36:49.707 --> 36:51.674
about what you were gonna do.

36:51.967 --> 36:53.934
The Mother will try to harm herself.

36:53.936 --> 36:55.736
Arianna will help her.

36:59.074 --> 37:00.930
Thank you for your sacrifice.

37:14.556 --> 37:16.990
You know, your son will always
know that you chose death...

37:16.992 --> 37:18.525
over him.

37:19.962 --> 37:21.763
Now the Witness is no longer safe,

37:21.788 --> 37:24.804
which is why the remainder of
your days here will be less, uh...

37:26.302 --> 37:27.901
comfortable.

37:36.573 --> 37:38.143
Mind yourself.

37:50.272 --> 37:51.694
I've got him.

37:51.718 --> 37:52.771
Where?

37:52.774 --> 37:53.999
Manhattan.

37:54.024 --> 37:55.824
The Emerson Hotel.

37:55.849 --> 37:57.377
What the hell is he doing there?

37:57.402 --> 37:59.225
Locking on.

38:00.148 --> 38:02.048
Initiate retrieval sequence.

38:07.846 --> 38:09.591
So that's it, huh?

38:09.616 --> 38:11.725
I'm supposed to just give up on Cassie?

38:11.727 --> 38:13.154
It's what needs to happen.

38:13.179 --> 38:14.761
What's the point, then?

38:14.763 --> 38:16.710
If it's all fate,
wh-why are we even here?

38:16.735 --> 38:18.843
Why go on? Why don't we just...

38:21.670 --> 38:23.642
That's how all this started.

38:23.667 --> 38:26.407
You and I... we're
supposed to be erased.

38:27.075 --> 38:28.860
We're still here.

38:29.537 --> 38:32.392
No matter what we do,
it never gets better.

38:33.915 --> 38:35.673
Once, though.

38:35.698 --> 38:38.895
The house. Cassie.

38:38.920 --> 38:41.921
That's the only life
we managed to erase.

38:47.667 --> 38:50.390
I didn't come here today to save Cassie.

38:52.434 --> 38:54.726
This is a long fight.

38:55.719 --> 38:57.929
You're only halfway there.

38:58.740 --> 39:00.468
It's gonna hurt.

39:01.710 --> 39:04.492
Things inside of you are gonna break.

39:05.213 --> 39:07.513
Things you never even knew you had.

39:10.318 --> 39:13.196
I'm gonna tell you something
I probably shouldn't.

39:13.656 --> 39:15.718
It's probably screwing with
all that causality bullshit

39:15.743 --> 39:18.013
Jones used to go on about.

39:25.801 --> 39:28.409
You're gonna have to forgive yourself...

39:28.981 --> 39:31.148
for what you've done.

39:31.173 --> 39:33.948
For what you're gonna have to do.

39:36.378 --> 39:38.252
There's a beginning...

39:38.751 --> 39:41.721
and there's an end to all this.

39:43.118 --> 39:45.819
And all you and I are ever gonna have

39:45.821 --> 39:48.068
is what's in between.

39:51.587 --> 39:53.718
Wearing this...

39:54.362 --> 39:56.095
means that somehow,

39:56.097 --> 39:57.703
somewhere,

39:58.500 --> 40:00.967
you're always gonna find
your way back to her.

40:06.060 --> 40:07.884
- Time to go.
- Time to go.

40:12.581 --> 40:14.056
See you soon.

40:35.570 --> 40:38.251
That was harder than I
thought it was gonna be.

40:38.276 --> 40:40.557
You told him there was hope.

40:42.041 --> 40:44.210
I had to get here somehow.

40:51.078 --> 40:53.510
You know there's another way.

40:53.721 --> 40:55.521
No.

40:55.546 --> 40:57.067
There's not.

41:09.905 --> 41:11.537
Mr. Cole.

41:23.235 --> 41:24.617
We're done.

41:24.619 --> 41:26.788
The answers we're looking
for aren't in Titan.

41:26.813 --> 41:28.488
Where are they?

41:28.490 --> 41:30.282
In the past, with Jennifer.

41:30.938 --> 41:32.969
We have to find her.

41:39.446 --> 41:41.045
And Dr. Railly?

41:42.751 --> 41:44.649
She's not the mission.

42:11.360 --> 42:13.132
No.

42:13.134 --> 42:14.567
Push.

42:18.480 --> 42:20.890
- Push.
- No.

42:21.312 --> 42:22.341
Push.

42:24.151 --> 42:25.369
No.

42:27.110 --> 42:28.751
Push.

42:32.856 --> 42:34.088
Push.

42:34.113 --> 42:35.461
No.

42:36.149 --> 42:37.415
Push.

42:37.987 --> 42:39.391
Push!

42:40.711 --> 42:41.977
Push.

42:44.432 --> 42:45.852
Push.

42:46.401 --> 42:48.001
Push!

42:51.285 --> 42:53.501
Push!

42:53.623 --> 42:55.022
No!

42:55.510 --> 42:56.860
Push.

42:57.947 --> 42:58.977
Push!

42:59.381 --> 43:00.380
Push!
