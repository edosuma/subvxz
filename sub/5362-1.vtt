00:58.809 --> 01:00.978
England

02:19.598 --> 02:21.975
-I finished my play.
-Well done.

02:22.059 --> 02:23.101
Have you seen Mummy?

02:23.185 --> 02:25.020
Well, she'll be in the drawing room, I expect.

02:25.103 --> 02:28.440
I hope you're not gonna be getting under
our feet today, Miss Briony.

02:28.524 --> 02:31.026
We got a dinner for 10 to prepare.

02:42.955 --> 02:46.875
-Hello, pal, I hear you're putting on a play.
-Who told you?

02:46.959 --> 02:48.377
Jungle drums.

02:49.711 --> 02:53.674
-Will you come and see it?
-I'm not sure that would be quite...

02:53.757 --> 02:54.925
Why don't you let me read it?

02:55.008 --> 02:57.427
You used to make me those beautiful
bound copies of all your stories.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.805
-I've kept them all.
-I still want you to come.

02:59.888 --> 03:02.850
-Let's see.
-I have to go now.

03:07.938 --> 03:09.606
Mummy, I need you!

03:13.610 --> 03:18.949
Stupendous. It's stupendous, darling.
Your first play.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.701
Do you think so?
Do you think Leon will like it?

03:20.784 --> 03:23.078
Well, of course he will.

03:23.161 --> 03:25.873
The Trials of Arabella, by Briony Tallis.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.260
Cee.
-Yes?

03:39.928 --> 03:42.055
What do you think it would feel like
to be someone else?

03:42.139 --> 03:44.308
Cooler, I should hope.

03:44.391 --> 03:47.060
-I'm worried about the play.
-I'm sure it's a masterpiece.

03:47.144 --> 03:50.063
But we only have the afternoon to rehearse.
What if the twins can't act?

03:50.147 --> 03:52.816
You have to be nice to them.
I wonder how'd you feel if your mother

03:52.900 --> 03:56.820
had run off with Mr What's-his-name
who reads the news on the wireless?

03:57.571 --> 04:00.324
Perhaps I should have written Leon a story.

04:00.407 --> 04:03.702
If you write a story, you only have to
say the word "castle," and you could see

04:03.785 --> 04:06.622
the towers and the woods
and the village below, but...

04:06.705 --> 04:09.625
In a play, it's...

04:09.708 --> 04:12.878
It all depends on other people.

04:13.462 --> 04:15.172
-Cee.
-Yes?

04:16.673 --> 04:19.134
Why don't you talk to Robbie any more?

04:19.218 --> 04:22.513
I do.
We just move in different circles, that's all.

04:35.526 --> 04:38.111
-Do we have to do a play?
-Why do we have to?

04:38.195 --> 04:41.114
-It's to celebrate my brother Leon's visit.
I hate plays.

04:41.198 --> 04:43.534
So do l.
-How can you hate plays?

04:43.617 --> 04:46.787
-It's just showing off.
-You'll be in this play or you'll get a clout.

04:46.870 --> 04:49.915
-And I'll tell the parents.
You're not allowed to clout us.

04:49.998 --> 04:53.710
We're guests in this house. And what did
the parents say we were to make ourselves?

04:53.794 --> 04:55.504
-Well, Pierrot?
-Amenable.

04:55.587 --> 04:57.464
-Jackson?
-Amenable.

04:57.548 --> 04:59.258
Amenable, that's right.

05:01.510 --> 05:03.720
Now, Briony, what's your play about?

05:04.429 --> 05:07.766
Well, it's about how

05:08.016 --> 05:11.103
love is all very well,
but you have to be sensible.

05:11.228 --> 05:13.230
-I suppose you're going to be Arabella.
-Well, not necessarily.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.816
-In that case, do you mind if I play her?
Lola was in the school play.

05:15.899 --> 05:20.112
Do say yes. It'd be the first decent thing
to happen to me in months.

05:21.029 --> 05:22.865
Well, yes, all right.

05:24.533 --> 05:26.159
I suppose we should start by reading it.

05:26.243 --> 05:29.329
If you're going to be Arabella, then I'll be
the director, thank you very much.

05:29.413 --> 05:30.581
Sorry.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.669
I'm going to do the prologue.

05:38.088 --> 05:39.423
"Prologue.

05:40.591 --> 05:43.260
"This is the tale of spontaneous Arabella,

05:43.343 --> 05:46.096
"who ran away with an extrinsic fellow.

05:46.180 --> 05:48.765
"It grieved her parents to see their firstborn

05:48.849 --> 05:50.851
"evanesce from her home
to go to Eastbourne."

05:52.060 --> 05:53.103
Yes?

05:55.856 --> 05:59.651
-Nothing. Just thought I'd watch.
Rehearsals are private, I'm afraid.

05:59.735 --> 06:01.862
You can see the play this evening.

06:01.945 --> 06:05.199
-I'll have to work then.
-Well, I'm sorry, Danny.

06:05.574 --> 06:08.160
Can we go for a swim now?
Yes, yes, yes!

06:08.243 --> 06:12.414
-No, I don't really think there's time!
Cecilia will let us.

06:12.539 --> 06:15.501
I'm sure a half-hour break
would do us all good.

06:15.584 --> 06:17.794
Cecilia? Cecilia!

06:19.421 --> 06:20.672
Cecilia!

08:27.508 --> 08:32.221
Cecilia! Cecilia, Cecilia.
Please, can we go for a swim, Cecilia?

08:32.304 --> 08:35.724
Yes, I don't see why not.
Don't go out of your depth!

09:51.425 --> 09:54.386
Can you do me
one of your Bolshevik roll-ups?

10:00.267 --> 10:03.645
Beautiful day.
-I suppose so. Too hot for me.

10:05.814 --> 10:07.608
-Are you enjoying your book?
-No, not really.

10:07.691 --> 10:08.775
It gets better.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.445
I prefer Fielding any day.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.950
Much more passionate.

10:30.464 --> 10:33.425
-Leon's coming down today, did you know?
-I heard a rumour.

10:33.509 --> 10:36.470
He's bringing a friend with him.
It's Paul Marshall, the chocolate millionaire.

10:36.553 --> 10:39.181
-Are the flowers for him?
-Why shouldn't they be?

10:39.264 --> 10:41.475
Leon says he's very charming.

10:43.769 --> 10:46.480
The Old Man telephoned last night.
He says you're planning on being a doctor.

10:46.563 --> 10:48.774
-I'm thinking about it, yes.
-Another six years of student life.

10:48.857 --> 10:50.984
-How else do you become a doctor?
-You could get a fellowship, now,

10:51.068 --> 10:52.653
-couldn't you? With your First?
-I don't want to teach.

10:54.863 --> 10:57.241
I said I'd pay your father back.

11:00.869 --> 11:03.163
That's not what I meant at all.

11:11.630 --> 11:13.340
-Let me help with that.
-No, I'm all right, thanks.

11:13.423 --> 11:15.676
-Take the flowers. Take the flowers.
-I'm all right. I'm all right.

11:20.389 --> 11:22.558
Oh, you idiot.

11:24.434 --> 11:26.395
Do you realise that's probably
the most valuable thing we own?

11:26.478 --> 11:28.438
Not any more, it isn't.

11:30.148 --> 11:31.483
Careful!

12:50.646 --> 12:51.730
I'm...

14:13.687 --> 14:15.189
Hello, Robbie!

14:20.569 --> 14:22.613
No need to encourage him.

14:33.957 --> 14:35.042
Cee?

14:38.962 --> 14:40.047
Mother?

14:42.549 --> 14:45.969
-Where is everyone, Danny?
-I don't know, sir.

14:46.094 --> 14:48.472
Sir.
Gasping for a drink.

14:51.475 --> 14:53.352
-Will you have one?
Rather.

14:54.478 --> 14:55.979
-Whisky?
-Please.

15:00.692 --> 15:02.319
-Leon!
-Here she is.

15:02.402 --> 15:07.282
Oh, I've missed you.
I've been going completely doolally up here.

15:07.366 --> 15:10.911
-This is my sister, Cecilia. Paul Marshall.
-I've heard an awful lot about you.

15:10.994 --> 15:13.247
-Likewise.
Where are we putting him?

15:13.330 --> 15:16.667
In the blue room. Mother's lying down,
she's got one of her migraines.

15:16.750 --> 15:19.169
I'm not surprised, with this heat.

15:21.547 --> 15:24.174
It's the big room next to the nursery.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.014
Is the Old Man staying in town?

15:31.098 --> 15:33.767
Looks like it.
Some sort of rush on at the Ministry.

15:50.534 --> 15:53.787
So aren't we doing the play?
No.

15:53.871 --> 15:56.790
Why not?
-Don't ask me.

15:58.750 --> 16:00.544
I don't like it here.

16:02.129 --> 16:03.755
There's always a problem
when a new brand comes about.

16:03.839 --> 16:05.757
The remarketing, the re-packaging,
the re-shaping.

16:05.841 --> 16:08.969
Even the re-flavouring in some cases,
or whole new technology.

16:09.469 --> 16:12.472
I think our main challenge is whether or not
to launch the new Amo Bar.

16:12.764 --> 16:16.268
The Army Amo. Do you see? Pass the Amo?

16:17.769 --> 16:19.146
My source at the Ministry is very reliable,

16:19.229 --> 16:21.648
I used to clean his shoes at Harrow,
informs me we have a good chance

16:21.732 --> 16:23.692
of including it
in the standard issue ration pack.

16:24.109 --> 16:26.653
Which means that I'd have to open
at least three more factories.

16:26.737 --> 16:29.031
More if they bring in conscription,
which I say is bound to happen

16:29.114 --> 16:30.616
if Herr Hitler doesn't pipe down.

16:30.699 --> 16:32.868
He's about as likely to do that as buy shares

16:32.951 --> 16:35.287
in Marks and Spencer's,
wouldn't you agree?

16:35.370 --> 16:38.373
-This isn't very good.
-I make a cocktail with crushed ice,

16:38.457 --> 16:42.127
rum and melted dark chocolate.
It's absolutely scrumptious.

16:48.967 --> 16:51.970
Guess who we met on the way in?
-Robbie.

16:52.054 --> 16:55.140
-I told him to join us tonight.
-Oh, Leon, you didn't.

16:55.807 --> 17:01.104
So, Robbie, the housekeeper's son,
whose father did a bunk 20 years ago,

17:01.188 --> 17:04.900
gets a scholarship to the local grammar,
the Old Man puts him through Cambridge,

17:04.983 --> 17:09.363
goes up at the same time as Cee, and
for three years she hardly speaks to him.

17:09.445 --> 17:11.490
Wouldn't let him within a mile
of her Roedean chums.

17:11.573 --> 17:13.450
Anyone got a cigarette?

17:13.534 --> 17:16.286
I don't know what the hell he's doing
these days, messing about in flower beds.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.539
As a matter of fact, he's planning on doing
a medical degree.

17:18.872 --> 17:21.290
And the Old Man said yes to that?

17:25.170 --> 17:28.006
Look, I really think you should go down
to the lodge and ask him not to come.

17:28.089 --> 17:30.801
Why? Has something happened
between you?

17:31.844 --> 17:33.387
For God's sake.

18:01.707 --> 18:04.751
-When can we go home?
Soon.

18:04.835 --> 18:07.087
We can't go home. It's a divorce.

18:09.548 --> 18:12.718
-How dare you say that?
-Well, it's true!

18:12.801 --> 18:16.305
You will never, ever use that word
again! Do you understand?

18:17.181 --> 18:20.893
-Now what are we going to do?
-I'm always asking myself that.

18:20.976 --> 18:24.938
My name is Paul Marshall.
You must be the cousins from the north.

18:25.189 --> 18:27.191
-What are your names?
-Pierrot.

18:27.274 --> 18:29.568
-Jackson.
-What marvellous names.

18:30.527 --> 18:31.904
Do you know our parents?

18:31.987 --> 18:33.405
Well, I've read
about them in the paper.

18:33.488 --> 18:38.035
-What exactly have you read about them?
-Oh, you know. The usual sort of nonsense.

18:38.118 --> 18:41.997
I'll thank you not to talk about this
in front of the children.

18:46.585 --> 18:48.545
Your parents
are absolutely wonderful people,

18:48.629 --> 18:52.925
that's quite clear, and they love you
and think about you all the time.

18:53.884 --> 18:55.552
Jolly nice slacks.

18:56.512 --> 18:58.263
We went to see a show
and I got them at Liberty's.

18:58.347 --> 19:01.642
-What was the show?
-Hamlet.

19:01.725 --> 19:05.187
Ah, yes. "To be or not to be."

19:10.442 --> 19:11.944
I like your shoes.

19:13.862 --> 19:19.576
Duckers in the Turl. They make
a wooden thing, shaped like your foot.

19:20.077 --> 19:21.662
Keep it forever.

19:22.704 --> 19:24.790
I'm starving. When's dinner?

19:25.958 --> 19:28.877
Well, I might be able to help you there,
if you can guess what I do for a living.

19:28.961 --> 19:31.547
-You've got a chocolate factory.
-Everyone knows that.

19:31.630 --> 19:34.466
Then it wasn't a guess, was it?

19:34.550 --> 19:38.512
There'll be one of these in every kit bag
of every soldier in the British Army.

19:38.595 --> 19:40.722
Sugar casing, so it won't melt.

19:40.806 --> 19:42.933
Why should they get free sweets?

19:43.016 --> 19:44.518
'Cause they'll be fighting for their country.

19:44.601 --> 19:46.937
Our daddy says
there isn't going to be a war.

19:47.020 --> 19:49.189
Your daddy is wrong.

19:50.983 --> 19:54.778
-Calling it the Army Amo.
-Amo, amas, amat.

19:54.862 --> 19:56.989
Top marks.

19:57.072 --> 20:01.618
It's boring how everything ends in "o."
"Polo" and "Aero."

20:01.702 --> 20:04.329
-And "Oxo" and "Brillo".
-Sounds as if you don't want it.

20:04.413 --> 20:07.541
Then I shall just have to give it
to your sister.

20:18.051 --> 20:19.136
Bite it.

20:21.305 --> 20:23.056
You have to bite it.

20:31.732 --> 20:35.152
The Princess was well aware
of his remorseless wickedness.

20:35.235 --> 20:38.864
But that made it no easier to overcome
the voluminous love she felt

20:38.947 --> 20:42.117
in her heart for Sir Romulus.
The Princess knew instinctively

20:42.201 --> 20:44.244
that the one with red hair
was not to be trusted.

20:44.328 --> 20:47.748
As his young ward dived again
and again to the depths of the lake,

20:47.831 --> 20:52.044
in search of the enchanted chalice,
Sir Romulus twirled his luxuriant moustache.

20:52.127 --> 20:56.715
Sir Romulus rode with his two companions,
northwards, drawing ever closer

20:56.798 --> 20:58.050
to an effulgent sea.

20:58.133 --> 21:01.345
So heroic in manner,
he appeared so valiant in word

21:02.804 --> 21:04.848
no one could ever guess at the darkness

21:04.932 --> 21:07.518
lurking in the black heart
of Sir Romulus Turnbull.

21:07.601 --> 21:10.521
He was the most dangerous man
in the world.

21:18.820 --> 21:22.282
"Dear Cecilia, I thought I should write
to apologise for my clumsy

21:22.366 --> 21:24.243
"and inconsiderate behaviour."

22:53.749 --> 22:56.001
"Forgive me if I seem strange but I'm..."

24:21.420 --> 24:25.591
Dear Cecilia, you'd be forgiven
for thinking me mad,

24:25.674 --> 24:27.467
the way I acted this afternoon.

24:27.551 --> 24:31.597
The truth is I feel rather lightheaded
and foolish in your presence, Cee,

24:31.680 --> 24:34.016
and I don't think I can blame the heat.

24:35.767 --> 24:37.269
"Will you forgive me?

24:40.314 --> 24:41.607
"Robbie."

24:59.041 --> 25:00.626
Off out then?

25:00.709 --> 25:03.295
Yes, Leon's asked me
to join them for dinner.

25:04.296 --> 25:07.841
So that's why I've been polishing
silver all afternoon.

25:07.925 --> 25:11.136
I'll think of you when I see my face
in the spoon.

25:14.723 --> 25:19.394
You're not a bit like your father.
Not in any way.

25:19.478 --> 25:22.314
That's because I'm all yours. I'll be late.

25:24.441 --> 25:26.860
Your shirts are hanging upstairs.

25:30.322 --> 25:32.449
-Son.
-Yes?

25:33.116 --> 25:34.535
Nothing.

26:27.129 --> 26:29.131
Briony! Is that you?

26:52.154 --> 26:53.697
Are you all right?

26:57.409 --> 26:59.703
Do you think you could do me a favour?

27:00.370 --> 27:03.624
Could you run ahead
and give this to Cee? I...

27:03.707 --> 27:08.420
-Feel a bit of a fool handing it over myself.
-All right.

27:34.196 --> 27:35.405
Briony.

28:02.307 --> 28:04.184
Briony!

28:24.163 --> 28:26.915
-I suppose he's what you might call eligible.
-Rather.

28:26.999 --> 28:29.168
He certainly seems to think
he's the cat's pyjamas.

28:29.251 --> 28:32.588
Which is odd, considering he has pubic hair
growing out of his ears.

28:32.671 --> 28:36.133
I should imagine he'd give you
a lot of very noisy, boneheaded sons.

28:36.216 --> 28:38.594
-He's quite a good egg, actually.
-You say that about everyone.

28:38.677 --> 28:42.472
-Leon!
-Rummy, if it ain't my little sis!

28:42.556 --> 28:45.559
I wrote you a play, Leon.
I wanted to do a play for you.

28:45.642 --> 28:47.436
-The Trials Of Arabella.
-Well, there's still time.

28:47.519 --> 28:49.104
-Doesn't have to be this evening.
-No, it's impossible.

28:49.188 --> 28:50.606
Briony.
Tell you what. I'm good at voices,

28:50.689 --> 28:52.524
you're even better,
so we'll read it out after dinner.

28:52.608 --> 28:55.527
-Briony, did you read this letter?
-Yes, let's. That's a wonderful idea.

28:55.611 --> 29:00.032
-Briony!
-Here we are. My choc-tail.

29:00.532 --> 29:02.409
I insist you try it.

29:03.327 --> 29:05.245
Wasn't there an envelope?

29:16.673 --> 29:18.383
Do you mind if I come in?

29:20.052 --> 29:22.429
I've had the most appalling evening.

29:23.972 --> 29:26.517
The twins have been torturing me. Look.

29:26.600 --> 29:27.935
How awful.

29:31.063 --> 29:32.397
Chinese burns.

29:33.982 --> 29:35.943
That's right.

29:36.276 --> 29:41.114
They want to go home.
They think it's me that's keeping them here.

29:46.954 --> 29:48.330
Lola.

29:49.039 --> 29:53.418
Can I tell you something?
Something really terrible.

29:53.502 --> 29:54.795
Yes, please.

29:55.629 --> 29:58.757
What's the worst word
you can possibly imagine?

30:09.351 --> 30:11.603
-He's a sex maniac!
-That's right.

30:11.687 --> 30:13.188
-What's Cecilia going to do?
-I don't know.

30:13.272 --> 30:15.858
-You ought to call the police.
-Do you think so?

30:15.941 --> 30:18.652
He said he thought about it all day long.

30:18.735 --> 30:20.904
All you have to do is show them the letter.

30:20.988 --> 30:23.782
-You won't tell anyone, will you, promise?
-I promise.

30:23.866 --> 30:27.077
Good. If he found out,
there's no knowing what he might do.

30:27.161 --> 30:28.370
You're right.

30:30.622 --> 30:33.917
You better tidy your face.
I've still got to change.

30:36.253 --> 30:38.839
Thanks, Briony. You're a real brick.

33:00.314 --> 33:01.440
Cecilia!

33:19.666 --> 33:22.127
-It was a mistake.
-Briony read it.

33:22.419 --> 33:24.671
My God, I'm so sorry.
It was the wrong version.

33:24.755 --> 33:26.048
Yes.

33:29.885 --> 33:31.970
-It was never meant to be read.
-No.

34:07.256 --> 34:08.841
What was in the version
I was meant to read?

34:08.924 --> 34:10.884
I don't know. It was more formal. Less...

34:10.967 --> 34:12.594
-Anatomical?
-Yes.

34:19.226 --> 34:23.438
It's been there for weeks,
and then this morning by the fountain...

34:32.739 --> 34:35.617
I've never done anything like that before.

34:35.951 --> 34:38.911
And I was so angry with you,
and with myself.

34:41.748 --> 34:45.252
I thought if you went away to medical
school, then I'd be happy, but...

34:45.335 --> 34:48.922
I don't know how I could have been
so ignorant about myself, so...

34:52.842 --> 34:54.386
So stupid.

35:01.101 --> 35:03.937
You do know what I'm talking about,
don't you?

35:06.607 --> 35:09.443
You knew before I did.

35:11.111 --> 35:12.946
Why are you crying?

35:14.490 --> 35:16.116
Don't you know?

35:16.617 --> 35:18.368
Yes, I know exactly.

37:02.681 --> 37:03.765
Robbie.

37:04.725 --> 37:05.809
Cecilia.

37:07.728 --> 37:08.854
I love you.

37:11.398 --> 37:12.774
I love you.

37:53.941 --> 37:55.609
Someone's come in.

37:57.277 --> 37:58.529
Cecilia!

38:42.573 --> 38:44.533
People were sitting out
having dinner on the pavement.

38:44.616 --> 38:49.037
It was always the view of my parents
that hot weather encouraged loose morals.

38:49.121 --> 38:51.498
In high summer, my sister and l
were never allowed out of the house.

38:51.582 --> 38:55.294
They thought the villagers would be
unnecessarily provoked.

38:57.212 --> 39:01.091
What do you say, Cee? Does the hot weather
make you behave badly?

39:02.885 --> 39:05.846
-Good heavens, you're blushing.
-It's just hot in here, that's all.

39:05.929 --> 39:08.515
Lola, wipe that lipstick off.
You're far too young.

39:08.599 --> 39:12.311
What about you, Briony?
What sins have you committed today?

39:13.187 --> 39:16.481
-I've done nothing wrong.
Have you seen the twins recently?

39:16.607 --> 39:19.276
They didn't look very happy
last time I saw them, poor little chaps.

39:19.359 --> 39:22.738
You know nothing about it.
-Briony. I can't imagine what's got into you.

39:22.821 --> 39:25.365
-I've never known you to be so rude.
Well, they're not poor little chaps.

39:25.449 --> 39:27.576
-Just look what they did to Lola.
-What are you talking about?

39:27.659 --> 39:30.871
Jackson and Pierrot
bruised her arm. Gave her Chinese burns.

39:30.954 --> 39:32.873
I'm afraid she's quite right.
I had to pull them off her.

39:32.956 --> 39:35.292
How I got my war wound.

39:35.375 --> 39:36.793
The twins did that, Lola?

39:36.877 --> 39:38.754
Yes, it all turned
into a bit of a wrestle,

39:38.837 --> 39:41.173
I'm afraid. Still, no harm done, eh, Lola?

39:41.256 --> 39:42.925
Would you go and find these boys,
please, Briony?

39:43.008 --> 39:44.718
Tell them dinner's ready,
and where are their manners?

39:44.801 --> 39:46.720
-Why do I have to go?
-Briony, you'll do as you're told,

39:46.803 --> 39:49.306
or you'll go straight to your room.

40:18.418 --> 40:19.920
It's a letter!
-Give it to me!

40:20.003 --> 40:21.588
They've run away.
Who has?

40:21.672 --> 40:23.006
The twins.

40:23.924 --> 40:28.929
"We are going to run away because Lola
is so horrid to us and we want to go home.

40:30.597 --> 40:32.140
-"Also, there wasn't a play."
-Don't worry.

40:32.224 --> 40:34.476
We'll send out some search parties.
They can't have gone far.

40:34.560 --> 40:36.603
Cee, you come with me.

40:42.401 --> 40:43.485
Pierrot!

40:44.319 --> 40:45.404
Jackson!

40:46.613 --> 40:47.739
Boys!

40:48.949 --> 40:50.033
Jackson!

40:52.244 --> 40:53.328
Pierrot!

42:33.387 --> 42:35.430
Lola? Are you all right?

42:36.014 --> 42:38.851
I'm sorry. I didn't... I'm sorry.

42:38.934 --> 42:41.019
Who was it?

42:43.272 --> 42:44.606
I saw him.

42:45.649 --> 42:46.733
I saw him.

42:47.776 --> 42:50.028
-It was him, wasn't it?
-Yes, it was him.

42:50.112 --> 42:51.697
Lola, who was it?

42:53.824 --> 42:57.286
It was Robbie, wasn't it? Robbie?

42:59.079 --> 43:01.748
-You saw him?
-Like you said, he's a sex maniac.

43:01.832 --> 43:04.585
And you don't even know
what happened before dinner.

43:04.668 --> 43:06.253
I caught him attacking my sister
in the library.

43:06.336 --> 43:08.547
I don't know what he'd have done
if I hadn't come in.

43:08.630 --> 43:12.092
-You actually saw him?
-Of course I did. Plain as day.

43:13.927 --> 43:18.223
He pushed me to the ground.
And then he put his hands over my eyes.

43:19.391 --> 43:24.479
-I couldn't actually... I never actually...
-Listen. I've known him

43:24.563 --> 43:26.773
my whole life, and I saw him.

43:27.566 --> 43:29.943
Because I couldn't say for sure.

43:30.777 --> 43:33.489
Well, I can. And I will.

43:38.285 --> 43:41.872
Call the police.
And she'll be needing a doctor, as well.

43:52.799 --> 43:57.095
-It's all right, dear. It's all right now.
Is Robbie back yet?

43:57.179 --> 43:59.389
I haven't seen him.

43:59.806 --> 44:01.642
I know who it was.

44:04.102 --> 44:07.564
-You saw him, then?
-Yes, I saw him.

44:07.648 --> 44:10.692
-Just as you see me?
-I know it was him.

44:10.776 --> 44:14.154
You know it was him? Or you saw him?

44:15.489 --> 44:18.992
-Yes, I did, I saw him.
-With your own eyes?

44:19.993 --> 44:23.789
Yes. I saw him, I saw him with my own eyes.

44:27.751 --> 44:29.336
Well done, darling.

45:20.929 --> 45:24.433
My brother and I found the two of them
down by the lake.

45:24.516 --> 45:26.643
You didn't see anyone else?

45:28.854 --> 45:33.567
I wouldn't necessarily believe everything
Briony tells you. She's rather fanciful.

45:41.783 --> 45:44.912
When they went looking,
I went up to my dad's.

45:44.995 --> 45:47.623
-I did, honest.
Why was that?

45:48.916 --> 45:50.667
To tell him all about it.

45:52.711 --> 45:56.256
-I know I shouldn't have opened it.
No, you should not.

45:57.758 --> 46:00.719
But at least you've done the right thing now.

46:39.800 --> 46:42.010
Sir, there is someone coming.

47:11.248 --> 47:13.083
-Time you went to bed.
-But...

47:13.167 --> 47:14.293
Now.

48:27.282 --> 48:28.367
Cecilia!

48:51.640 --> 48:56.270
You liars! You liars! Liars! Liars!

49:36.185 --> 49:38.353
Northern France
Four years later

49:43.859 --> 49:47.362
I says to him, I says, "You can sit
down there, twiddling your thumbs,

49:47.446 --> 49:49.531
"waiting to get your head blown off,
if you want to.

49:49.615 --> 49:50.782
"I'm off out of it."

50:00.459 --> 50:04.421
Bonsoir monsieur. Bonsoir?
Let me do this.

50:19.645 --> 50:21.063
What's his game?

50:21.146 --> 50:23.440
-He says he's got something for us.
-Fucking hell!

50:24.775 --> 50:26.985
Wait! We have food for you

50:27.110 --> 50:28.237
Bread, sugar

50:28.320 --> 50:29.404
And wine!

50:39.790 --> 50:41.458
What are you doing here?

50:47.714 --> 50:51.260
When the retreat started, Panzers attacked,

50:52.261 --> 50:54.429
and I was separated from my unit

50:54.596 --> 50:57.099
So it's true, the English are retreating

50:59.935 --> 51:02.604
We'll be gone at first light

51:04.148 --> 51:07.025
We fought all those years,
lost all those dead,

51:07.484 --> 51:09.987
now the Germans are in France again

51:13.532 --> 51:14.950
We will come back

51:17.119 --> 51:18.787
we will throw them out

51:20.622 --> 51:23.417
I promise you

51:24.793 --> 51:26.461
Good luck

51:31.466 --> 51:32.843
Come on, then.

51:32.926 --> 51:36.930
How come a toff like you, talks French
and everything, ends up a private?

51:37.014 --> 51:40.642
Not eligible for officers' training
if you join direct from prison.

51:40.809 --> 51:44.062
-You're pulling my tit.
-No, I'm not.

51:45.647 --> 51:49.109
They gave me a choice.
Stay in prison or join the Army.

51:50.152 --> 51:53.322
And for the record,
the last thing I am is a toff.

52:12.299 --> 52:14.343
Six months earlier

52:41.537 --> 52:43.038
I'm sorry I'm late, I got lost.

52:43.163 --> 52:44.915
-Hello.
-Hello.

52:54.675 --> 52:57.219
-Should we sit down?
-Yes, of course.

53:12.317 --> 53:15.487
-I'm sorry, I can't remember, l...
-Two. Thank you.

53:50.063 --> 53:51.940
Where are you living?

53:53.609 --> 53:55.944
Tiny flat in Balham. It's ghastly.

53:56.028 --> 53:59.323
-The landlady's rude and horribly nosy.
-You look the same.

53:59.406 --> 54:01.909
-Apart from the uniform, of course.
-Yes, I'm sorry. I've got to go back

54:01.992 --> 54:05.120
-to the hospital in half an hour.
-Oh, God, that...

54:26.475 --> 54:27.893
-Sorry.
-No.

54:32.022 --> 54:34.608
Have you been in touch with your family?

54:34.691 --> 54:36.735
No, I told you I wouldn't.

54:38.237 --> 54:40.614
Leon waited outside the hospital last week,
I just pushed past him.

54:40.697 --> 54:43.450
Cee, you don't owe me anything.

54:45.577 --> 54:48.205
Robbie, didn't you read my letters?

54:48.622 --> 54:50.833
Had I been allowed to visit you,
had they let me every day,

54:50.916 --> 54:53.418
-I would have been there every day.
-Yes, but...

54:53.502 --> 54:57.089
If all we have rests on a few moments

54:57.172 --> 54:59.758
in a library three and a half years ago,
then I'm not sure,

54:59.842 --> 55:02.970
-I don't know if...
-Robbie, look at me.

55:06.139 --> 55:08.767
Look at me.

55:09.852 --> 55:11.228
Come back.

55:14.439 --> 55:16.150
Come back to me.

55:30.414 --> 55:32.166
Dearest Cecilia.

55:33.876 --> 55:36.003
Dearest Cecilia.

55:43.260 --> 55:44.386
Cecilia.

55:59.902 --> 56:01.987
A friend of mine has a cottage by the coast.

56:02.070 --> 56:04.406
Said we can borrow it
when you're next on leave.

56:04.490 --> 56:07.618
White clapboard
with blue-painted window frames.

56:09.411 --> 56:12.789
-I hope this bus never comes.
-Here.

56:14.958 --> 56:17.794
Something to think of while you're away.

56:40.234 --> 56:41.360
I love you.

58:12.117 --> 58:14.286
Some poor sod's gonna catch a packet.

58:22.836 --> 58:27.090
My darling. Briony found
my address somehow, and sent a letter.

58:28.300 --> 58:31.053
The first surprise was
she didn't go up to Cambridge.

58:31.136 --> 58:33.931
She's doing nurse's training
at my old hospital.

58:35.140 --> 58:37.935
I think she may be doing this
as some kind of penance.

58:38.018 --> 58:42.731
She says she's beginning to get the full
grasp of what she did, and what it meant.

58:42.856 --> 58:45.359
She wants to come and talk to me.

58:46.693 --> 58:51.448
I love you. I'll wait for you. Come back.

58:52.866 --> 58:53.951
Come back to me.

58:55.285 --> 58:57.704
Come back. Come back to me.

58:58.747 --> 59:01.917
Come back. Come back to me.

59:05.337 --> 59:07.339
So where we going, guv?

59:22.062 --> 59:24.314
Fucking hate those boots!

59:24.398 --> 59:27.192
I hate them worse
than all the fucking Germans put together!

59:27.276 --> 59:30.445
You'll have a job getting back to England
in your socks.

01:01:08.210 --> 01:01:10.963
Come on, pal,
you should be getting dressed.

01:01:11.046 --> 01:01:14.216
-If I fell in, would you save me?
-Of course.

01:01:26.895 --> 01:01:27.938
Briony!

01:01:53.213 --> 01:01:54.381
Thank you.

01:02:02.681 --> 01:02:04.141
Thank you! Thank you, thank you!

01:02:04.224 --> 01:02:06.977
That's an incredibly bloody
stupid thing to do.

01:02:07.102 --> 01:02:08.479
I wanted you to save me.
-Don't you know

01:02:08.562 --> 01:02:10.230
how easily you could have drowned?

01:02:10.564 --> 01:02:13.400
-You saved me.
-Stupid child!

01:02:13.484 --> 01:02:17.321
You could have killed us both.
Is that your idea of a joke?

01:02:19.072 --> 01:02:21.783
I want to thank you for saving my life.

01:02:22.951 --> 01:02:25.579
I will be eternally grateful to you.

01:02:38.091 --> 01:02:39.968
The story can resume.

01:02:40.761 --> 01:02:44.806
Our story can resume. I will simply resume.

01:02:45.432 --> 01:02:47.893
Jerry, come and have a go at us
in fucking South End.

01:02:47.976 --> 01:02:52.981
Or better still, Trafalgar Square.
No one speaks the fucking lingo out here.

01:02:53.065 --> 01:02:55.984
You can't say, "Pass the biscuit," or
"Where's me hand grenade?"

01:02:56.068 --> 01:02:59.613
They just shrug. Because they hate us, too.
I mean, that's the point.

01:02:59.696 --> 01:03:03.116
We fight in France
and the French fucking hate us.

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:06.370
Make me Home Secretary,
I'll sort this out in a fucking minute.

01:03:06.453 --> 01:03:08.956
We got India and Africa, right?

01:03:09.039 --> 01:03:12.417
Jerry can have France and Belgium
and wherever else they want.

01:03:12.501 --> 01:03:16.380
Who's fucking ever been to Poland?
It's all about room, empire.

01:03:16.463 --> 01:03:19.550
They want more empire,
give 'em this shithole, we keep ours,

01:03:19.633 --> 01:03:22.761
and it's "Bob's your uncle"
and "Fanny's your fucking aunt"!

01:03:22.845 --> 01:03:24.429
Think about it.

01:03:34.314 --> 01:03:37.651
Dearest Cecilia.
The story can resume.

01:03:39.987 --> 01:03:43.240
The one I had been planning
on that evening walk.

01:03:44.658 --> 01:03:47.536
I can become again the man
who once crossed the Surrey park

01:03:47.619 --> 01:03:52.166
at dusk in my best suit,
swaggering on the promise of life.

01:03:52.249 --> 01:03:56.879
The man who, with the clarity of passion,
made love to you in the library.

01:04:01.466 --> 01:04:03.343
The story can resume.

01:04:07.431 --> 01:04:10.100
I will return,

01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:13.020
find you, love you,

01:04:13.103 --> 01:04:16.607
marry you. And live without shame.

01:04:34.249 --> 01:04:35.918
You can smell the sea.

01:05:08.242 --> 01:05:09.284
Fuck me.

01:05:10.619 --> 01:05:15.499
-It's like something out of the Bible.
Jesus Christ.

01:05:17.668 --> 01:05:19.878
Come on, get everybody
to clean this mess up now.

01:05:20.254 --> 01:05:22.881
We've just arrived, sir. Can you
tell us what we're supposed to be doing?

01:05:22.965 --> 01:05:25.259
Nothing. Just wait.
Where are the ships?

01:05:25.342 --> 01:05:28.011
A few made it in yesterday,
Luftwaffe blew them to buggery.

01:05:28.095 --> 01:05:30.889
Lost 3,000 men
when they sank the Lancastria.

01:05:30.973 --> 01:05:34.434
High command, in its infinite wisdom,
is denying us air cover.

01:05:34.518 --> 01:05:36.395
A disgrace, a fucking disaster.

01:05:36.478 --> 01:05:39.148
No, look, the thing is, you see,
I'm expected back, you see.

01:05:39.231 --> 01:05:42.985
There's over 300,000 men on this beach,
Private. You'll have to wait your turn.

01:05:43.068 --> 01:05:47.447
Just be grateful you're not wounded.
I've orders to leave the wounded behind.

01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:52.911
No, no, no, leave it, guv! Never trust a sailor
on dry land. You're best off out of it.

01:06:07.384 --> 01:06:08.719
That's not right.

01:06:33.410 --> 01:06:34.495
Christ.

01:06:41.877 --> 01:06:43.754
Can you hear me, laddies?

01:06:43.837 --> 01:06:46.173
I'm coming home!

01:07:44.857 --> 01:07:49.444
Take from our souls
the strain and stress

01:07:49.528 --> 01:07:53.866
And let our ordered lives confess

01:07:53.949 --> 01:07:58.120
The beauty of Thy peace

01:07:58.203 --> 01:08:03.125
The beauty of Thy peace

01:08:03.584 --> 01:08:08.213
Breathe through the heats of our desire

01:08:08.297 --> 01:08:12.593
Thy coolness and Thy balm

01:08:12.759 --> 01:08:17.096
Let sense be numb, let flesh retire

01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:21.518
Speak through the earthquake, wind and fire

01:08:21.602 --> 01:08:25.856
O still, small voice of calm

01:08:56.511 --> 01:08:57.595
Guv'nor.

01:09:01.433 --> 01:09:03.852
I have to get something to drink.

01:09:03.935 --> 01:09:06.479
You need one. You're grey.

01:09:06.563 --> 01:09:09.399
He's gone all grey, can you see?

01:09:25.415 --> 01:09:27.167
There. Come on.

01:09:29.377 --> 01:09:31.046
All I want's a cup of tea now.

01:09:48.354 --> 01:09:50.816
What the fuck you doing?

01:10:15.591 --> 01:10:21.472
I'm coming home!
Laddie, I'm coming home!

01:10:24.391 --> 01:10:30.814
Fuck 'em all! Fuck 'em all!
The long and the short and the tall

01:10:30.898 --> 01:10:35.736
Fuck all the Sergeants and WO1s
Fuck all the corporals

01:10:35.819 --> 01:10:37.362
and their bastard sons

01:10:37.446 --> 01:10:43.744
'Cause we're saying goodbye to them all
As back to their billets they crawl

01:10:43.869 --> 01:10:47.247
You'll get no promotion
this side of the ocean

01:10:47.331 --> 01:10:51.084
So cheer up, my lads
Fuck 'em all!

01:12:01.196 --> 01:12:02.698
Mike!

01:12:09.454 --> 01:12:10.914
Mike!

01:12:13.375 --> 01:12:14.626
Hold up, guv.

01:12:23.218 --> 01:12:24.344
Wait here.

01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:06.386
Why don't you sit down?

01:13:15.103 --> 01:13:17.022
It's so hot in here.

01:13:17.606 --> 01:13:19.483
Take off your boots.

01:13:38.794 --> 01:13:42.506
I have to get back. I promised her.

01:13:42.589 --> 01:13:44.800
To put things right.

01:13:44.883 --> 01:13:49.138
And she loves me. She's waiting for me.

01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:54.393
Oi!

01:13:57.729 --> 01:13:58.897
Wait, wait, wait.

01:14:00.065 --> 01:14:03.152
Hey, what have you done with your boots?

01:14:05.779 --> 01:14:08.407
-Look, you're sure you're feeling all right?
-Never better.

01:14:08.490 --> 01:14:12.536
Now I'm wondering whether the beach
really is the best place for dinner.

01:14:14.204 --> 01:14:19.251
-I'm not sure, I don't recognise it.
-Dunno.

01:14:19.334 --> 01:14:21.545
-This'll do, down here.
-No.

01:14:22.671 --> 01:14:25.257
-No, no, it's further on.
-What is?

01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:27.551
This place I know, an old cottage
with white clapboards

01:14:27.634 --> 01:14:30.220
and blue-painted window frames.

01:14:32.097 --> 01:14:36.143
Aw, yes.
That's right, that's where we're going.

01:14:36.226 --> 01:14:40.397
-It's close to here.
-We're there. This is it.

01:15:03.045 --> 01:15:05.631
Here we are, guv. Down here.

01:15:42.376 --> 01:15:45.087
That's all right, guv. That's right.

01:15:47.130 --> 01:15:51.677
Get your head down. Get your head down.
There you go.

01:16:07.151 --> 01:16:10.112
Tuck yourself in. Keep yourself warm.

01:16:17.244 --> 01:16:21.999
Chew on a bit of this. But quiet like,
or they'll all be wanting some.

01:16:25.627 --> 01:16:27.713
Try and get some sleep.

01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:00.806
Find you.

01:18:02.141 --> 01:18:03.392
Love you.

01:18:04.184 --> 01:18:05.686
Marry you.

01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:08.397
And live without shame.

01:18:38.969 --> 01:18:44.850
I love you. Come back. Come back to me.

01:18:51.023 --> 01:18:53.192
Bit too much noise, guv'nor.
-What?

01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:57.821
-What noise?
-You keep shouting.

01:18:57.905 --> 01:19:00.824
-Some of the lads are getting a bit peeved.
-What?

01:19:12.961 --> 01:19:17.633
-Christ. You look a bit rough.
-Thing is, I've decided to stay on for a bit.

01:19:18.759 --> 01:19:22.054
I'm meeting someone,
and I'm always keeping her waiting.

01:19:22.137 --> 01:19:25.724
Now, listen. Listen to me, guv'nor.

01:19:26.350 --> 01:19:30.604
I went out for a Jimmy Riddle just now.
Guess what I saw!

01:19:31.188 --> 01:19:34.399
They're getting themselves sorted out
down on the beach.

01:19:34.691 --> 01:19:39.488
The boats are back, and a geezer from
the Buffs is marching us down at 7:00.

01:19:40.447 --> 01:19:43.784
We're away. We're off home, mate.

01:19:46.286 --> 01:19:50.082
So get some more sleep, and no more
of your bleeding shouting.

01:19:50.165 --> 01:19:54.378
-All right?
-I won't say a word.

01:19:57.214 --> 01:20:00.050
Wake me before 7:00, would you?
Thanks so much.

01:20:02.427 --> 01:20:07.432
You won't hear another word
from me. Promise.

01:20:12.146 --> 01:20:15.774
London
Three weeks earlier

01:20:57.274 --> 01:20:59.902
Bed castors should be lined up
and pointing inwards.

01:20:59.985 --> 01:21:03.197
I found three yesterday that weren't.
You know who you are.

01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:05.616
Which of you were responsible
for putting away the blankets today?

01:21:05.699 --> 01:21:07.743
I was, Sister.
-I don't suppose you can tell us

01:21:07.826 --> 01:21:09.286
-what you did wrong?
-No, Sister.

01:21:09.369 --> 01:21:11.163
Labels are folded to the inside,
are they not?

01:21:11.246 --> 01:21:12.664
-Yes, Sister.
-Do them again.

01:21:12.748 --> 01:21:17.085
Nurse Tallis, I'll see you in my office.
The rest of you are excused.

01:21:30.015 --> 01:21:33.185
-ls this job at all important to you, Tallis?
-Very important, Sister.

01:21:33.268 --> 01:21:35.479
Yesterday, you were seconded
to men's surgical.

01:21:35.562 --> 01:21:38.565
When your patient came round from his
anaesthetic, it seems the first thing he did

01:21:38.649 --> 01:21:41.109
was to ask for Briony.
Who might Briony be?

01:21:41.193 --> 01:21:44.363
-Well, me, Sister.
-There is no Briony.

01:21:44.446 --> 01:21:47.908
You are Tallis. Nurse Tallis.
Is that understood?

01:21:47.991 --> 01:21:49.159
Yes, Sister.

01:21:59.294 --> 01:22:00.796
There is no Briony.

01:22:05.008 --> 01:22:08.595
This is the BBC
Home Service. Here is the news.

01:22:08.679 --> 01:22:12.141
The BEF, with their French allies,
are fighting a desperate battle

01:22:12.224 --> 01:22:14.560
in the northern zone of the Western Front.

01:22:14.643 --> 01:22:19.064
The Allied Forces have not lost
cohesion, and their morale is high.

01:22:19.148 --> 01:22:22.025
The RAF continues to give all the support
in its power

01:22:22.109 --> 01:22:25.362
to the Allied armies in northeastern
France and Belgium. Railways, roads,

01:22:25.445 --> 01:22:29.283
bridges and enemy troops have been
continuously attacked, yesterday...

01:22:46.592 --> 01:22:49.887
Thanks. I never could make the scissors
work with my left hand.

01:22:49.970 --> 01:22:52.097
Mummy always did it for me.

01:22:53.474 --> 01:22:55.267
There, you're done.

01:22:59.771 --> 01:23:00.856
Bother!

01:23:07.321 --> 01:23:08.363
Night-night, Ponty.

01:23:09.781 --> 01:23:11.575
Good night, Tallis.

01:23:26.882 --> 01:23:29.218
Don't panic! It's only me.

01:23:29.301 --> 01:23:33.013
Fiona, I almost jumped out of my skin.

01:23:33.806 --> 01:23:36.809
So this is where you duck to after lights out.

01:23:36.892 --> 01:23:41.104
I thought you might be in the middle
of some tempestuous romance.

01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:44.191
Don't you freeze to death up here?

01:23:46.610 --> 01:23:48.237
I love London.

01:23:49.947 --> 01:23:52.324
Do you think all of this will be
bombed and just disappear?

01:23:52.407 --> 01:23:53.492
No.

01:23:55.118 --> 01:23:56.703
I don't know.

01:23:57.621 --> 01:23:59.915
Do you write about Sister Drummond?

01:24:00.791 --> 01:24:03.126
-Do you write about me?
-Sometimes.

01:24:04.336 --> 01:24:07.840
-Can I look?
-I'd rather you didn't. It's private.

01:24:08.674 --> 01:24:12.302
I don't see any point in writing a story
if you're not going to let anyone read it.

01:24:12.386 --> 01:24:14.847
-It's not ready yet. It's unfinished.
-What's it about?

01:24:21.478 --> 01:24:24.481
-It's complicated.
-Yes?

01:24:24.565 --> 01:24:25.774
It's just...

01:24:28.235 --> 01:24:33.198
It's about a young girl, a young and
foolish girl, who sees something from

01:24:33.282 --> 01:24:37.828
her bedroom window which she doesn't
understand, but she thinks she does.

01:24:41.456 --> 01:24:43.625
I probably won't ever finish it.

01:24:44.251 --> 01:24:47.421
I look at you, Tallis,
and you're so mysterious.

01:24:48.088 --> 01:24:50.507
I've never been mysterious.

01:24:52.217 --> 01:24:55.012
-Do you know what I decided tonight?
-What?

01:24:57.473 --> 01:25:01.059
I could never marry a man
who wasn't in the Royal Navy.

01:25:10.736 --> 01:25:13.530
Here we are. Cecilia Tallis.

01:25:14.031 --> 01:25:16.200
I think this is her address.

01:25:18.243 --> 01:25:19.411
Thank you.

01:25:28.420 --> 01:25:32.174
Dear Cecilia. Please don't
throw this away without reading it.

01:25:33.300 --> 01:25:35.803
As you'll have seen from the
notepaper, I'm here at St Thomas'

01:25:35.886 --> 01:25:38.138
doing my nurses' training.

01:25:38.222 --> 01:25:40.724
I decided not to take up
my place at Cambridge.

01:25:40.808 --> 01:25:42.184
Oh, God.

01:25:43.852 --> 01:25:47.648
I decided I wanted to make myself useful.
Do something practical.

01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:53.445
It says in the newspaper
the Army are making strategic withdrawals.

01:25:53.529 --> 01:25:54.613
Yes, I saw that.

01:25:54.696 --> 01:25:56.740
It's a euphemism for retreat.

01:25:58.075 --> 01:26:01.787
No matter how hard I work,
no matter how long the hours,

01:26:02.704 --> 01:26:05.165
I can't escape from what I did

01:26:05.249 --> 01:26:08.293
and what it meant,

01:26:08.377 --> 01:26:12.089
the full extent of which
I am only now beginning to grasp.

01:26:19.054 --> 01:26:22.015
Cee, please write and tell me we can meet.

01:26:23.767 --> 01:26:25.602
Your sister, Briony.

01:26:27.938 --> 01:26:30.816
So do you?
-Do I what?

01:26:31.233 --> 01:26:35.529
Have a secret fiancé in France.
That's what everyone thinks.

01:26:35.612 --> 01:26:36.655
No, of course not.

01:26:36.738 --> 01:26:39.324
Imagine not knowing if he'd ever come back.

01:26:39.408 --> 01:26:41.577
I've never been in love.

01:26:42.327 --> 01:26:45.038
What, never? Not even a crush?

01:26:45.706 --> 01:26:49.168
Oh, I had a crush once, when I was 10 or 11.

01:26:51.378 --> 01:26:54.715
I jumped into a river to see
if he'd save me from drowning.

01:26:54.798 --> 01:26:58.302
-Now you're teasing me.
-Oh, no. And he did save me.

01:27:01.305 --> 01:27:04.975
But as soon as I told him I loved him,
the feeling sort of disappeared.

01:27:05.058 --> 01:27:06.643
Something's happened.

01:27:11.106 --> 01:27:12.608
Outside, quickly.

01:27:56.777 --> 01:27:58.028
Robbie.

01:28:02.074 --> 01:28:03.158
Excuse me.

01:28:52.833 --> 01:28:56.295
Nurse Tallis, you speak a little French,
if I remember rightly.

01:28:56.378 --> 01:28:57.629
Only school French, Sister.

01:28:57.713 --> 01:29:02.050
There's a soldier in Bed 13. Go and sit
with him for a minute. Hold his hand.

01:29:02.134 --> 01:29:03.260
Off you go.

01:29:57.231 --> 01:29:58.732
Here you are at last

01:29:59.608 --> 01:30:01.235
Sister sent me

01:30:01.318 --> 01:30:03.570
for a little chat

01:30:06.406 --> 01:30:08.659
I remember your sister

01:30:09.159 --> 01:30:11.703
she was always so nice

01:30:13.413 --> 01:30:14.998
what's she doing now?

01:30:16.875 --> 01:30:20.212
She is a nurse as well

01:30:21.255 --> 01:30:24.383
Did she finally marry that man
she was so in love with?

01:30:25.050 --> 01:30:26.468
I've forgotten his name

01:30:26.552 --> 01:30:27.636
Robbie?

01:30:29.388 --> 01:30:30.889
She will soon I hope

01:30:31.849 --> 01:30:32.933
Robbie

01:30:33.559 --> 01:30:35.394
yes that's right

01:30:37.688 --> 01:30:38.772
And you?

01:30:39.106 --> 01:30:40.649
What is your name?

01:30:42.860 --> 01:30:43.902
Luc.

01:30:45.404 --> 01:30:46.822
Luc Cornet.

01:30:49.032 --> 01:30:50.284
And you?

01:30:50.367 --> 01:30:51.451
Tallis.

01:30:52.870 --> 01:30:53.912
Tallis.

01:30:55.747 --> 01:30:57.666
That's pretty

01:31:02.588 --> 01:31:05.215
I remember you now

01:31:07.176 --> 01:31:09.303
the English girl

01:31:10.512 --> 01:31:13.307
You remember your first visit to Millau?

01:31:14.641 --> 01:31:17.186
I was working by the ovens with my father.

01:31:18.187 --> 01:31:20.355
I heard your accent

01:31:24.485 --> 01:31:27.237
Can you do me a little favour Tallis?

01:31:29.156 --> 01:31:31.825
These bandages are so tight,

01:31:32.159 --> 01:31:35.287
can you loosen them a bit, please?

01:31:36.413 --> 01:31:37.831
Of course

01:31:45.714 --> 01:31:48.050
You remember my younger sister, Anne?

01:31:50.469 --> 01:31:53.514
She still plays that little Debussy piece

01:31:55.265 --> 01:31:56.683
do you remember?

01:31:59.061 --> 01:32:02.147
She looks so serious when she plays

01:32:03.273 --> 01:32:05.150
And our croissants,

01:32:05.776 --> 01:32:07.611
what did you think of them?

01:32:15.244 --> 01:32:17.412
The most delicious in Millau

01:32:17.830 --> 01:32:18.872
Yes.

01:32:19.081 --> 01:32:21.208
it's the quality of the butter

01:32:22.918 --> 01:32:23.961
Yes

01:32:27.464 --> 01:32:29.925
Is that why you came every day?

01:32:31.385 --> 01:32:32.970
Because you know,

01:32:34.930 --> 01:32:38.392
my mother is very fond of you

01:32:39.101 --> 01:32:40.811
in her opinion,

01:32:41.311 --> 01:32:44.064
we should get married in the summer

01:32:44.439 --> 01:32:45.899
Oh yes?

01:32:46.150 --> 01:32:47.651
Yes

01:32:55.617 --> 01:32:57.995
I hope that's more comfortable

01:33:02.916 --> 01:33:03.959
Do you love me?

01:33:04.042 --> 01:33:06.044
Yes

01:33:14.428 --> 01:33:16.889
Can you stay a while?

01:33:18.390 --> 01:33:21.435
I'm frightened

01:33:30.777 --> 01:33:32.404
-Tallis.
-Briony.

01:33:34.156 --> 01:33:35.949
Je m'appelle Briony.

01:33:47.795 --> 01:33:49.880
Stand up, Nurse Tallis.

01:33:54.843 --> 01:33:57.596
Now go and wash the blood off your face.

01:34:59.449 --> 01:35:04.413
The Navy has earned our
undying gratitude. The Army is undefeated.

01:35:04.496 --> 01:35:08.250
Courage has brought them through
unconquered, their spirit unbowed.

01:35:08.333 --> 01:35:10.419
This is the epic of Dunkirk.

01:35:10.502 --> 01:35:14.756
A name that will live forever
in the annals of warfare.

01:35:18.510 --> 01:35:20.721
In the course of a comprehensive tour,

01:35:20.804 --> 01:35:24.558
Queen Elizabeth is seen here visiting
a chocolate factory in the north of England.

01:35:24.641 --> 01:35:26.977
The confectionary magnate
and friend of the British Army,

01:35:27.060 --> 01:35:31.315
Mr Paul Marshall, gave the Queen a tour
of the Army Amo factory

01:35:31.398 --> 01:35:35.777
with his lovely,
soon-to-be-wed fiancée, Miss Lola Quincey.

01:35:35.861 --> 01:35:38.614
What a mouthwatering couple they are.

01:35:38.739 --> 01:35:42.284
Keep the Amo coming.
Our boys have a sweet tooth.

01:36:09.895 --> 01:36:15.859
Secondly, for a remedy against sin,
and to avoid fornication,

01:36:15.943 --> 01:36:19.822
that such persons
as have not the gift of continence,

01:36:19.905 --> 01:36:25.494
might marry and keep themselves
undefiled members of Christ's body.

01:36:26.328 --> 01:36:31.542
Thirdly, it was ordained,
for the mutual society, help and comfort,

01:36:31.625 --> 01:36:35.170
that the one ought to have the other.

01:36:35.254 --> 01:36:36.380
I saw him.

01:36:36.463 --> 01:36:40.384
Therefore, if any man can show
any just cause

01:36:40.467 --> 01:36:43.428
why they may not be
lawfully joined together...

01:36:43.595 --> 01:36:44.638
I know it was him.

01:36:44.888 --> 01:36:50.352
...Iet him now speak
or forever hold his peace.

01:36:56.942 --> 01:36:59.653
I saw him. I saw him with my own eyes.

01:37:42.070 --> 01:37:43.780
Let the nursey through.

01:37:43.864 --> 01:37:46.366
They're going down to the country today.
Never been out of London before.

01:37:46.450 --> 01:37:47.659
I hope they get a nice family.

01:37:47.743 --> 01:37:49.995
They don't know what they're in for
with this lot.

01:37:50.078 --> 01:37:51.163
Come on.

01:38:09.264 --> 01:38:12.351
I'm looking for Miss Tallis. Cecilia Tallis.

01:38:13.769 --> 01:38:14.853
Is she in?

01:38:20.984 --> 01:38:23.487
Tallis! Door!

01:38:31.286 --> 01:38:33.539
I tried writing. You wouldn't answer.

01:38:38.544 --> 01:38:40.420
I have to talk to you.

01:39:05.070 --> 01:39:07.447
-So you're a ward sister now?
-Yes.

01:39:20.836 --> 01:39:21.920
Thanks.

01:39:31.305 --> 01:39:33.348
I want to go in front of a judge
and change my evidence, Cee.

01:39:33.432 --> 01:39:35.142
Don't call me that.

01:39:40.772 --> 01:39:42.774
Please don't call me that.

01:39:45.736 --> 01:39:48.113
I know what I did was terrible.
I don't expect you to forgive me.

01:39:48.197 --> 01:39:50.240
Oh, don't worry, I won't.

01:39:52.367 --> 01:39:54.912
You're an unreliable witness.
They'll never reopen the case.

01:39:54.995 --> 01:39:56.747
Well, at least
I could tell everyone else what I did.

01:39:56.830 --> 01:39:59.249
I can go home and explain
to Mummy and Daddy and Leon...

01:39:59.333 --> 01:40:01.585
-So what's stopping you?
-Well, I wanted to see you first.

01:40:01.668 --> 01:40:03.879
They don't want to hear any more about it.

01:40:03.962 --> 01:40:07.174
That unpleasantness is all tidied away
in the past, thank you very much.

01:40:07.257 --> 01:40:08.383
But...

01:40:16.391 --> 01:40:18.644
I'll be late. Better get moving.

01:40:22.189 --> 01:40:23.524
Excuse me.

01:40:29.905 --> 01:40:31.782
He sleeps so deeply.

01:41:32.050 --> 01:41:35.387
-What is she doing here?
-She wanted to speak to me.

01:41:35.471 --> 01:41:37.347
Oh, yes, what about?

01:41:37.431 --> 01:41:38.807
The terrible thing I did.

01:41:38.891 --> 01:41:40.392
Robbie. Darling.

01:41:44.396 --> 01:41:46.398
I'll be quite honest with you.

01:41:46.482 --> 01:41:47.941
I'm torn between breaking your neck here

01:41:48.025 --> 01:41:51.028
and taking you
and throwing you down the stairs.

01:41:51.111 --> 01:41:52.237
Oh, God.

01:41:52.321 --> 01:41:56.408
Do you have any idea what it's like in jail?
Of course, you don't.

01:41:56.783 --> 01:41:59.369
Tell me, did it give you pleasure
to think of me inside?

01:41:59.453 --> 01:42:01.288
-No.
-But you did nothing about it.

01:42:01.371 --> 01:42:03.081
-No.
-Do you think I assaulted your cousin?

01:42:03.165 --> 01:42:04.249
-No.
-Did you think it then?

01:42:04.333 --> 01:42:05.417
Yes. But yes and no.

01:42:05.501 --> 01:42:07.419
-And what's made you so certain now?
-Growing up.

01:42:07.503 --> 01:42:09.046
-Growing up?
-I was 13.

01:42:09.129 --> 01:42:12.299
How old do you have to be to know
the difference between right and wrong?

01:42:12.382 --> 01:42:13.801
What are you, 18?

01:42:13.884 --> 01:42:16.762
Do you have to be 18 before
you can bring yourself to own up to a lie?

01:42:16.845 --> 01:42:20.933
There are soldiers of 18, old enough
to be left to die by the side of the road,

01:42:21.016 --> 01:42:22.434
-did you know that?
-Yes.

01:42:22.518 --> 01:42:24.812
Five years ago,
you didn't care about telling the truth.

01:42:24.895 --> 01:42:28.232
You, all your family, you just assumed
that for all my education,

01:42:28.315 --> 01:42:31.443
I was still little better than a servant.
Still not to be trusted!

01:42:31.527 --> 01:42:34.571
Thanks to you, they were able to close ranks
and throw me to the fucking wolves!

01:42:34.655 --> 01:42:37.658
-Robbie! Look at me, look at me.
-Don't!

01:42:37.741 --> 01:42:41.370
Come back. Come back.

01:42:43.914 --> 01:42:46.166
Come back to me.

01:43:10.190 --> 01:43:11.275
Briony.

01:43:13.152 --> 01:43:14.862
There isn't much time.

01:43:16.113 --> 01:43:19.867
Robbie has to report for duty at 6:00,
and he's got a train to catch.

01:43:21.535 --> 01:43:22.870
So sit down.

01:43:28.792 --> 01:43:31.545
There are some things
you're going to do for us.

01:43:48.353 --> 01:43:50.105
You'll go to your parents
as soon as you can,

01:43:50.189 --> 01:43:51.565
and you'll tell them everything
they need to know

01:43:51.648 --> 01:43:54.693
to be convinced
that the evidence you gave was false.

01:43:54.776 --> 01:43:56.445
You'll meet with a solicitor,
make a statement,

01:43:56.528 --> 01:43:58.697
have it signed, witnessed,
send copies to us. Is that clear?

01:43:58.780 --> 01:43:59.907
Yes.

01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:02.826
You'll write a detailed letter to me
explaining everything that happened

01:44:02.910 --> 01:44:04.912
leading up to you saying
you saw me by the lake.

01:44:04.995 --> 01:44:06.246
Try to include whatever you can remember

01:44:06.330 --> 01:44:08.123
of what Danny Hardman was doing
that night.

01:44:08.207 --> 01:44:09.458
-Hardman?
-Yes.

01:44:12.669 --> 01:44:14.338
It wasn't Danny Hardman.

01:44:15.214 --> 01:44:17.216
It was Leon's friend, Marshall.

01:44:18.050 --> 01:44:19.134
I don't believe you.

01:44:19.218 --> 01:44:22.471
He's married Lola.
I've just come from their wedding.

01:44:28.477 --> 01:44:31.146
Lola won't be able to testify
against him now.

01:44:33.565 --> 01:44:34.983
He's immune.

01:44:50.749 --> 01:44:55.504
I'm very, very sorry for the terrible distress
that I have caused.

01:44:57.506 --> 01:44:59.758
I am very, very sorry.

01:45:00.300 --> 01:45:02.302
Just do as we've asked of you.

01:45:02.678 --> 01:45:07.141
Write it all down, just the truth, no rhymes.
No embellishments, no adjectives.

01:45:08.892 --> 01:45:10.644
And then leave us be.

01:45:12.563 --> 01:45:13.981
I will, I promise.

01:46:16.794 --> 01:46:19.004
I'm sorry.
Could we stop for a moment?

01:46:20.380 --> 01:46:22.007
Of course. Is something the matter?

01:46:22.090 --> 01:46:25.344
I just need a couple of minutes by myself.

01:46:27.721 --> 01:46:29.556
...minutes by myself.

01:46:30.974 --> 01:46:36.355
Briony Tallis, your new novel,
your twenty-first, is called Atonement. It's...

01:46:38.232 --> 01:46:39.316
Briony?

01:46:44.530 --> 01:46:46.740
I'm sorry. Could we stop for a moment?

01:47:21.984 --> 01:47:26.155
Briony Tallis, I'd like to talk now
about your new novel, Atonement,

01:47:26.238 --> 01:47:29.825
which comes out in a few days
to coincide with your birthday.

01:47:30.409 --> 01:47:34.830
-It's your twenty-first novel...
-It's my last novel.

01:47:36.373 --> 01:47:38.959
Oh, really? Are you retiring?

01:47:40.169 --> 01:47:41.503
I'm dying.

01:47:43.714 --> 01:47:47.926
My doctor tells me
I have something called vascular dementia,

01:47:49.553 --> 01:47:52.639
which is essentially
a continuous series of tiny strokes.

01:47:52.723 --> 01:47:58.353
Your brain closes down, gradually
you lose words, you lose your memory,

01:47:58.437 --> 01:48:01.482
which for a writer is pretty much the point.

01:48:04.318 --> 01:48:08.947
So that's why I could finally write the book,
I think. I had to.

01:48:09.781 --> 01:48:12.117
And why, of course, it's my last novel.

01:48:15.329 --> 01:48:16.872
Strangely enough,

01:48:21.752 --> 01:48:26.089
it would be just as accurate
to call it my first novel.

01:48:27.257 --> 01:48:32.471
I wrote several drafts as far back as my time
at St Thomas' Hospital during the War.

01:48:33.263 --> 01:48:35.766
I just couldn't ever find the way to do it.

01:48:36.558 --> 01:48:39.019
Because the novel is autobiographical,
is that right?

01:48:39.102 --> 01:48:42.606
Yes, entirely. I haven't changed any names,
including my own.

01:48:42.689 --> 01:48:44.525
And was that the problem?

01:48:45.859 --> 01:48:46.985
No.

01:48:47.861 --> 01:48:52.616
I had, for a very long time,
decided to tell the absolute truth.

01:48:54.117 --> 01:48:56.286
No rhymes, no embellishments.

01:49:05.295 --> 01:49:06.630
And I think...

01:49:09.675 --> 01:49:12.302
You've read the book,
you'll understand why.

01:49:14.304 --> 01:49:18.559
I got first-hand accounts of all the events
I didn't personally witness,

01:49:19.184 --> 01:49:24.148
the conditions in prison,
the evacuation to Dunkirk, everything.

01:49:25.649 --> 01:49:28.861
But the effect of all this honesty
was rather pitiless.

01:49:28.944 --> 01:49:35.033
You see, I couldn't any longer imagine
what purpose would be served by it.

01:49:36.535 --> 01:49:39.121
By what? Sorry. Served by honesty?

01:49:39.204 --> 01:49:40.330
By honesty.

01:49:41.707 --> 01:49:43.041
Or reality.

01:49:48.505 --> 01:49:50.382
Because, in fact,

01:49:51.717 --> 01:49:56.430
I was too much of a coward
to go and see my sister in June, 1940.

01:49:58.223 --> 01:50:00.017
I never made that journey to Balham.

01:50:00.100 --> 01:50:01.768
Do you have any idea
what it's like in jail?

01:50:01.852 --> 01:50:03.896
So the scene in which
I confess to them is imagined.

01:50:03.979 --> 01:50:05.105
He sleeps so deeply.

01:50:05.189 --> 01:50:06.231
Invented.

01:50:06.315 --> 01:50:09.234
How old do you have to be to know
the difference between right and wrong?

01:50:09.318 --> 01:50:11.778
And, in fact,
could never have happened.

01:50:11.862 --> 01:50:12.946
Because

01:50:15.365 --> 01:50:20.287
Robbie Turner died of septicaemia
at Bray-Dunes

01:50:21.413 --> 01:50:23.749
on June the first, 1940,

01:50:24.792 --> 01:50:26.877
the last day of the evacuation.

01:50:31.757 --> 01:50:32.966
Cheerio, pal.

01:51:06.792 --> 01:51:10.838
And I was never able to put things right
with my sister, Cecilia,

01:51:12.589 --> 01:51:17.177
because she was killed
on the 15th of October, 1940,

01:51:17.511 --> 01:51:21.849
by the bomb that destroyed the gas
and water mains above Balham tube station.

01:51:58.594 --> 01:51:59.678
So...

01:52:02.222 --> 01:52:05.934
My sister and Robbie were never able
to have the time together

01:52:07.519 --> 01:52:11.648
they both so longed for, and deserved.

01:52:13.442 --> 01:52:16.320
And which, ever since, I've...

01:52:21.408 --> 01:52:25.662
Ever since I've always felt I prevented.

01:52:32.252 --> 01:52:35.380
But what sense of hope,

01:52:36.965 --> 01:52:41.428
or satisfaction, could a reader derive
from an ending like that?

01:52:42.262 --> 01:52:48.811
So, in the book, I wanted to give Robbie
and Cecilia what they lost out on in life.

01:52:50.187 --> 01:52:55.442
I'd like to think
this isn't weakness or evasion,

01:52:58.070 --> 01:53:00.197
but a final act of kindness.

01:53:01.990 --> 01:53:08.747
I gave them their happiness.

01:59:59.316 --> 02:00:00.359
