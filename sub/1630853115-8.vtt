WEBVTT

00:40.331 --> 00:42.250
Stay with me. Come on, now.

00:42.333 --> 00:43.543
Come on, now.

00:48.882 --> 00:49.883
Stay with me.

01:11.154 --> 01:12.697
-My lord!
-Make room!

01:12.781 --> 01:14.157
Oh my God! Kate!

01:14.240 --> 01:15.950
Call the surgeon at once!

01:17.744 --> 01:19.245
She has a cut on the back of her head.

01:19.329 --> 01:21.331
I kept pressure on it,
but it needs stitching.

01:22.040 --> 01:25.085
-Miss Sharma? Can you hear me?
-She needs more blankets. She's shivering!

01:25.168 --> 01:26.920
Allow me to get to work.

01:35.303 --> 01:37.764
What happened?
My valet saw you carry Miss Sharma inside.

01:38.348 --> 01:39.349
Is she all right?

01:39.974 --> 01:40.934
I do not know.

01:41.976 --> 01:42.894
Are you all right?

01:50.610 --> 01:51.861
It's my fault.

01:55.031 --> 01:56.366
It is all my fault.

02:00.286 --> 02:01.454
Anthony.

02:01.538 --> 02:02.747
Anthony.

02:04.707 --> 02:05.583
Anthony.

02:20.431 --> 02:22.058
Where is she?

02:22.142 --> 02:23.935
It's been a week since she last published.

02:24.018 --> 02:27.230
There should've been at least
two issues by now, if not three.

02:27.313 --> 02:30.483
Perhaps she had nothing more to say
about that radical ruffian,

02:30.567 --> 02:31.818
Eloise Bridgerton.

02:33.403 --> 02:36.197
You there. What've you done
with our scandal sheet?

02:36.281 --> 02:38.825
Nothing today, sir.
Would you like a newspaper?

02:40.827 --> 02:42.078
Nonsense.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.665
I do hope
Whistledown picks up her pen again

02:45.748 --> 02:48.042
in time to write about
my forthcoming nuptials.

02:48.126 --> 02:49.919
Perhaps she rested her pen

02:50.003 --> 02:53.047
so she did not have to write
about such an uninteresting affair.

02:53.131 --> 02:55.466
Or perhaps she was done
ruining the lives of others.

02:56.426 --> 02:58.720
Mama, I wish to visit Eloise.
It has been a week.

02:58.803 --> 03:02.098
You will not set foot into that household.
Do you understand me?

03:02.807 --> 03:05.393
So, where are we with, uh, Mr. Bridgerton?

03:05.476 --> 03:07.854
We are close.
I'm set to meet with him this afternoon.

03:07.937 --> 03:11.941
Very well. Do you not think it time
for us to spend some of our earnings?

03:12.025 --> 03:13.443
Our coffers are overflowing.

03:13.526 --> 03:15.904
Well, I suppose
I could use a larger gun cabinet.

03:15.987 --> 03:18.781
I was thinking more
of some kind of celebration.

03:18.865 --> 03:19.949
Varley.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.285
Lord Featherington and I
would like to give a ball.

03:22.368 --> 03:23.703
-Excellent idea.

03:23.786 --> 03:25.914
So that we may finally
celebrate our engagement?

03:25.997 --> 03:29.167
So that we may finally
celebrate all of us.

03:29.250 --> 03:34.172
Varley, I want luster and glitter
and gold. I want the best of everything.

03:34.255 --> 03:36.174
And we will call it

03:37.258 --> 03:39.177
"The Featherington Ball."

03:39.260 --> 03:40.428
How original.

03:40.511 --> 03:43.264
I will have invitations
sent out straight away, ma'am.

03:43.348 --> 03:46.809
Now… …what about
the Bridgertons and the Sharmas?

03:46.893 --> 03:48.978
Considering the state of their households.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.773
It would be titillating to see
those two families in one place again.

03:51.856 --> 03:53.566
Everyone does love a touch of drama.

03:53.650 --> 03:57.111
Everyone knows Miss Sharma
is yet to awaken from her accident.

03:57.695 --> 04:00.198
Perhaps we shouldn't make jest
of her family at a time like this?

04:00.281 --> 04:03.743
Invite them all. They likely
will not come, of course, poor souls,

04:03.826 --> 04:06.788
but let everyone be allowed
to finally see how well we're doing.

04:07.872 --> 04:09.916
After such a tragic year.

04:10.500 --> 04:11.709
I was thinking…

04:21.678 --> 04:25.181
Roses and lilacs,
I think, this time. Cheerful.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.891
Thank you, Mrs. Wilson.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.104
Are you sending flowers
to the Sharmas again?

04:32.188 --> 04:35.149
There's nothing worse than rotting flowers
when someone is unwell.

04:36.359 --> 04:38.778
We're not attending
this Featherington Ball, are we?

04:38.861 --> 04:41.990
Oh, I do not know. I suppose
it is a good thing we were invited.

04:42.657 --> 04:46.160
On my walk this morning
I was given the cut direct. Twice.

04:46.286 --> 04:49.289
At least Lady Whistledown
does not seem to be writing about it.

04:49.372 --> 04:52.333
She does not seem to be writing
at all anymore. Is that not right, El?

04:53.376 --> 04:54.836
Eloise, uh,

04:54.919 --> 04:58.131
perhaps a stroll with Penelope
might help clear your mind.

04:58.214 --> 05:01.843
The last thing Penelope needs is to be
seen consorting with the likes of me.

05:01.926 --> 05:04.304
The Featheringtons know
how bad this is. And you do too.

05:04.387 --> 05:05.555
Even if you refuse to admit.

05:05.638 --> 05:08.308
No one informed me that we have lost
three staff in the last month.

05:09.017 --> 05:10.935
These are precisely
the things I must know about.

05:11.019 --> 05:13.813
We are not the only ones affected
by our ill reputation of late, Anthony.

05:13.896 --> 05:17.442
Colin. Would you care
to inform me about anything?

05:18.151 --> 05:21.112
-I do not take note of staff changes.
-What about our accounts?

05:21.195 --> 05:22.989
You do not seem
to take note of them either,

05:23.072 --> 05:25.074
since I spent
the last two days balancing our books,

05:25.158 --> 05:27.452
only to discover that you
have taken out a rather large sum.

05:28.411 --> 05:29.537
Whatever for?

05:32.123 --> 05:36.336
If you must know, I was exploring
an investment with Lord Featherington.

05:36.419 --> 05:38.713
This is just what makes
the difficulties in this household.

05:38.796 --> 05:40.882
No one gives any thought
as to how it must be managed.

05:40.965 --> 05:42.050
He is one and 20, Brother.

05:42.133 --> 05:44.135
Is no one allowed
to make their own decisions?

05:44.218 --> 05:45.136
You, keep doodling.

05:45.219 --> 05:46.971
And do not ask me
to speak of your activities.

05:47.055 --> 05:48.264
I wouldn't know where to begin.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.933
May I be excused?

05:51.893 --> 05:53.019
I must go too.

05:54.228 --> 05:55.396
But do not worry, Brother.

05:55.480 --> 05:58.066
I shall send you notice
of every step I take today.

05:58.149 --> 06:01.444
-Yes. Doodling awaits, I suppose.
-I do have so much to read.

06:02.028 --> 06:03.696
I have my Latin.

06:10.912 --> 06:11.788
How is she?

06:14.499 --> 06:15.792
I do not know. I have not--

06:15.875 --> 06:19.128
You have not been to see her?
It has been a week--

06:19.212 --> 06:20.838
Have I not made it clear I've been busy?

06:29.097 --> 06:32.850
I would be lying if I said
I was not worried about you, Anthony.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.521
I do not have time for this.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.149
Well…

06:42.193 --> 06:44.320
perhaps you might wish to make time.

07:14.016 --> 07:16.310
Miss Eloise. A package for you.

07:16.394 --> 07:19.647
-Oh, I do not want any--
-You might want this one.

07:22.900 --> 07:23.985
I'll be outside.

08:14.994 --> 08:15.995
You got my note.

08:16.704 --> 08:18.456
Why did you not tell me sooner?

08:19.415 --> 08:21.292
Why did you continue lying to me?

08:21.375 --> 08:23.920
Carrying on with me,
when you knew, this entire time

08:24.003 --> 08:26.380
that the real Lady Whistledown
has been using this very shop

08:26.464 --> 08:27.798
to print her scandal sheet.

08:27.882 --> 08:29.008
I couldn't tell you.

08:29.634 --> 08:31.385
Not when she was still watching me.

08:32.220 --> 08:35.598
Why do you think I ended things with you,
despite wanting to do the very opposite?

08:37.099 --> 08:39.101
I did not want her
to see the two of us together.

08:39.185 --> 08:40.978
I didn't want her to write cruelly of you.

08:41.062 --> 08:42.271
A little late for that.

08:47.985 --> 08:49.862
I owe you an apology, Miss Bridgerton.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.281
For everything.

08:52.949 --> 08:55.451
Whistledown has now
taken her business elsewhere.

08:55.535 --> 08:58.037
-Thought you deserve to know the truth.
-I deserve more than that.

09:01.207 --> 09:03.334
She seems to have stopped writing at all.

09:03.417 --> 09:05.962
Which is why now is
the perfect time to find her,

09:06.045 --> 09:08.881
when she is unsuspecting,
and with your knowledge of her methods

09:08.965 --> 09:11.926
and my endeavors, I'm sure
together we can finally unmask her.

09:17.848 --> 09:19.642
I must know everything you know.

09:20.476 --> 09:23.354
The manuscripts came early mornings.

09:23.437 --> 09:24.438
Twice a week, usually.

09:24.522 --> 09:26.941
-You have the wrapping they came in?
-Never came in wrapping.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.277
They came sewn into silks.

09:38.202 --> 09:42.623
I was pleased to receive
your invitation today, Your Majesty.

09:42.707 --> 09:45.084
I had thought you might
not wish to see me after

09:45.167 --> 09:47.837
the, uh, events of late.

09:47.920 --> 09:48.921
Yes.

09:49.005 --> 09:51.674
I seem to have some time on my hands

09:51.757 --> 09:54.427
without Lady Whistledown
to keep me occupied.

09:54.510 --> 09:57.597
I thought you might offer me
some stimulating conversation.

09:57.680 --> 09:58.556
Ah.

09:58.639 --> 10:01.684
I never did learn the true reason

10:01.767 --> 10:04.020
why the viscount and his bride

10:04.103 --> 10:06.397
did not walk back down the aisle together.

10:06.480 --> 10:08.691
Did it have anything to do
with Lord Bridgerton's

10:08.774 --> 10:10.318
political radical of a sister?

10:11.027 --> 10:13.904
I would not know, ma'am.
We have all been busy

10:13.988 --> 10:16.365
keeping the elder Miss Sharma in mind

10:16.449 --> 10:20.286
until, as we hope,
she recovers… from her fall.

10:20.369 --> 10:21.621
Of course.

10:21.704 --> 10:25.333
I shall send a few necklaces
to express my sympathies.

10:25.916 --> 10:28.336
-That is kind of you.
-It's not a problem.

10:29.086 --> 10:32.214
Do you believe anyone else
is bound for the aisle this season?

10:33.090 --> 10:34.133
What about Lord Fife

10:34.216 --> 10:37.094
and that dour child
who fancies herself a harpist?

10:37.178 --> 10:39.555
I am unaware of such a match.

10:39.639 --> 10:45.269
Lady Whistledown had a monopoly
on such, uh, speculations, did she not?

10:45.936 --> 10:50.066
Eh, perhaps it would do us all some good

10:50.149 --> 10:53.986
to find new interests.

11:00.785 --> 11:02.870
Mind your business, Will.

11:04.080 --> 11:07.583
And by "your business,"
I mean this bar. It needs tending.

11:09.460 --> 11:11.921
So, then, where are these mines, exactly?

11:12.004 --> 11:13.756
I hesitate
to say the exact location.

11:13.839 --> 11:16.384
I would not want
other prospectors taking over nearby.

11:16.467 --> 11:17.301
Mondrich!

11:17.385 --> 11:18.886
Pleasure seeing you here.

11:18.969 --> 11:20.513
Well, it is his bar.

11:20.596 --> 11:23.391
Seems the lord is treating it
more like his private office

11:23.474 --> 11:25.059
for conducting his schemes.

11:25.142 --> 11:27.687
"Schemes" is a rather
unpleasant word, don't you think?

11:27.770 --> 11:30.731
Mr. Bridgerton, you cannot be
entertaining any of this in earnest.

11:30.815 --> 11:33.609
-The man is a swindler.
-I beg your pardon, Mondrich.

11:34.402 --> 11:37.279
It is a trait he seems to share
with his late cousin,

11:37.363 --> 11:39.073
someone I myself became involved with

11:39.156 --> 11:43.411
and whose unscrupulous actions
I once mistakenly condoned.

11:43.494 --> 11:45.329
Perhaps you may be able
to see it for yourself.

11:45.413 --> 11:48.749
The Featheringtons,
giving the most lavish ball of the season.

11:48.833 --> 11:51.419
-Quite a celebration for a family who--
-Leave them out of it.

11:52.878 --> 11:54.672
The Featheringtons are a fine family

11:54.755 --> 11:57.216
whose reputation
has been most unfairly traduced.

11:57.299 --> 12:00.678
I would be very careful
of the accusations you make in future,

12:00.761 --> 12:04.265
as it hardly seems you can afford
to drive away any more patrons.

12:05.850 --> 12:08.936
Perhaps we might find another place
to conduct our business, Featherington?

12:21.907 --> 12:23.909
Colin Bridgerton has taken the bait.

12:23.993 --> 12:26.162
You may have allowed me
to move into my bedchamber,

12:26.245 --> 12:28.831
but that does not mean
you can just burst in unannounced.

12:28.914 --> 12:29.874
My apologies.

12:31.625 --> 12:35.087
Well, the ball
is coming together delightfully.

12:35.171 --> 12:37.965
Gold flowers,
gold drinks, gold everywhere.

12:38.632 --> 12:40.217
Do you not like gold?

12:40.301 --> 12:41.761
Now that Mr. Bridgerton is in,

12:41.844 --> 12:44.305
it seems we have
well-nigh exhausted the entire ton.

12:44.889 --> 12:48.309
-But how can that be?
-We've been efficient. An excellent team.

12:49.018 --> 12:53.773
Well, we can always make trips to visit
the wealthy families in the countryside.

12:53.856 --> 12:57.151
The wealthy families in the countryside
are few and far between.

12:57.943 --> 13:00.488
Meanwhile, the families here
will begin asking for a return

13:00.571 --> 13:01.864
on their investments before long.

13:01.947 --> 13:05.701
And then, well,
this whole thing falls apart.

13:05.785 --> 13:08.579
Do not tell me you have
no plan of escape, my lord.

13:10.372 --> 13:11.540
We leave London.

13:13.626 --> 13:14.835
Travel to the Americas.

13:15.878 --> 13:17.922
I will do no such thing.

13:18.005 --> 13:20.132
You like being on top here, yes?

13:20.216 --> 13:23.761
Well, then imagine
how good it will feel to be in a new city.

13:23.844 --> 13:27.515
Endless opportunity, endless wealth,
for us to secure together.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.018
Portia, we could be an even better team

13:31.101 --> 13:35.064
without the restrictions
of this godforsaken society.

13:36.106 --> 13:38.859
You do know that America has no royalty.

13:39.902 --> 13:41.779
You could be their queen.

13:55.334 --> 13:56.585
Think about it.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.010
Oh, and,

14:05.094 --> 14:06.929
I do very much like gold.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.696
You must not do this, Didi.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.450
You must not leave me like this.
We have to…

14:31.161 --> 14:32.162
Please.

14:50.139 --> 14:51.181
Edwina.

14:54.894 --> 14:57.771
Mama! Lady Danbury! Make haste!

14:57.855 --> 14:59.064
Oh…

15:02.693 --> 15:03.861
-Dearest?
-She is awake!

15:03.944 --> 15:06.405
-Oh!
-Thank heavens. Send for the doctor.

15:06.488 --> 15:08.198
-Kate.

15:08.782 --> 15:10.117
Do you remember?

15:11.619 --> 15:13.704
I remember riding in the park.

15:15.205 --> 15:16.373
And the fall.

15:17.082 --> 15:19.627
Oh, Mama, Edwina, I am so sorry.

15:19.710 --> 15:22.004
You must rest, Didi.
Do not strain yourself.

15:28.302 --> 15:30.512
Did Lord Bridgerton come to see me?

15:30.596 --> 15:32.348
He…

15:32.431 --> 15:34.808
He rescued you in the park.

15:35.643 --> 15:37.019
Gallantly, in fact.

15:37.102 --> 15:39.438
He brought you back here several days ago.

15:44.068 --> 15:44.902
And since?

15:53.327 --> 15:54.328
I see.

15:58.415 --> 15:59.500
You are right.

16:00.501 --> 16:01.585
I must rest.

16:18.686 --> 16:20.854
I will join the family
in the drawing room momentarily.

16:20.938 --> 16:21.772
Anthony.

16:25.025 --> 16:27.861
-She's awake?
-Mrs. Wilson heard from one of the maids.

16:54.763 --> 16:57.683
It is… unthinkable.

17:00.644 --> 17:02.521
Finding someone like that.

17:05.149 --> 17:06.108
Someone

17:07.234 --> 17:08.402
you love.

17:13.198 --> 17:15.325
I am sorry.

17:15.409 --> 17:19.413
I am so sorry that it was you
who was with your father that day.

17:19.496 --> 17:23.167
And I am… sorry
for everything that happened

17:23.250 --> 17:24.918
in the days that followed.

17:26.336 --> 17:29.715
If I could go back and change things--
You have no idea

17:29.798 --> 17:32.384
how much I wish I could change everything.

17:34.261 --> 17:37.765
It is what I think about every night
before I close my eyes,

17:37.848 --> 17:40.768
and then again every morning
before I open them.

17:42.644 --> 17:44.271
It will never go away.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.787
I do not think that I can see her.

18:12.716 --> 18:16.804
Losing Edmund was
the most difficult time of my life.

18:18.972 --> 18:20.808
And the pain that I felt…

18:25.354 --> 18:26.814
beyond description.

18:29.775 --> 18:34.279
But there is one thing that has given me
at least some modicum of solace.

18:34.363 --> 18:35.405
It's knowing

18:36.198 --> 18:38.534
that I would still choose
the life I led with him,

18:38.617 --> 18:40.577
each and every time.

18:41.870 --> 18:43.413
And I would undoubtedly feel

18:43.497 --> 18:46.375
the same pain I felt
all over again if I had to

18:46.458 --> 18:50.838
because real, true love is worth it.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.343
No matter what.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.683
Do not lose her, Anthony.

19:04.601 --> 19:06.061
You cannot lose her.

19:23.745 --> 19:25.539
-Mademoiselle Bridgerton.
-Ah.

19:26.165 --> 19:29.877
What are you doing here on your own?
I thought you did not care for <i>vêtements.</i>

19:29.960 --> 19:31.336
I am not here for dresses.

19:31.420 --> 19:34.339
I should, however, like to dress you down.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.008
<i>Excuse-moi?</i>

19:36.091 --> 19:38.093
You worked with her, did you not?

19:38.177 --> 19:39.178
Lady Whistledown?

19:41.430 --> 19:44.892
<i>Mon Dieu! </i>You have a fantastical mind.

19:46.351 --> 19:49.229
I thought you were her at one point.
That proved to be wrong.

19:49.313 --> 19:53.066
But I do realize you have boys
taking packages in and out all day long,

19:53.150 --> 19:54.902
which puts you
in the most perfect position

19:54.985 --> 19:58.113
to direct her issues to the printer
without raising a single eyebrow.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.740
I don't know what you are talking about.

20:02.701 --> 20:05.954
"Madame Delacroix is old,
but at least she is capable."

20:06.038 --> 20:07.831
Not often Whistledown
throws out a compliment.

20:07.915 --> 20:12.085
I do not know many ladies who'd consider
being called "old" a compliment.

20:12.169 --> 20:15.047
-Your business prospered after she wrote--
-Miss Eloise.

20:15.797 --> 20:20.802
It would be foolish of me to be engaged
with such a scandalous person.

20:21.637 --> 20:25.182
As foolish as it is for you
to be poking around like this

20:25.265 --> 20:28.227
when I know what Whistledown
recently wrote of <i>you.</i>

20:29.228 --> 20:30.145
No?

20:30.229 --> 20:33.190
Madame Delacroix,
we would like to be gilded.

20:38.403 --> 20:39.238
El.

20:43.283 --> 20:44.534
Meet me outside.

20:52.542 --> 20:55.295
I realize you are not to be seen with me,
but spare me just one moment.

20:55.379 --> 20:58.298
The print shop where Theo works
was, in fact, Whistledown's.

20:58.382 --> 20:59.675
He has told me everything.

21:00.842 --> 21:03.887
Eloise, I thought you had quit your hunt.
Were Whistledown's words not enough?

21:03.971 --> 21:06.098
You are not listening to me!
I am going to find her now!

21:06.181 --> 21:07.557
Do not scream at me!

21:11.436 --> 21:13.105
I am-- I'm sorry. I--

21:13.647 --> 21:16.692
People know you…
you have been speaking to him. Theo.

21:17.526 --> 21:20.070
There's been gossip about you
and a man from the lower classes.

21:20.153 --> 21:21.905
You had to have heard people talking.

21:22.489 --> 21:24.241
Who? Who is talking?

21:24.324 --> 21:25.409
Servants.

21:25.492 --> 21:29.162
Those who have heard it from their houses.
My sister asked me about it the other day.

21:31.540 --> 21:33.834
I thought I had been discreet.
Are you quite sure?

21:33.917 --> 21:35.460
Lady Whistledown has done you a favor.

21:36.628 --> 21:39.798
If she were to find out about this
and write about it, then…

21:41.008 --> 21:44.136
Your family are already
in a great deal of trouble.

21:44.928 --> 21:47.097
You've been consumed
by thoughts of her for far too long.

21:47.180 --> 21:49.433
First, you love her.
Then you hate her. It is enough.

21:49.516 --> 21:52.394
I do not want to hear about it anymore.

21:54.396 --> 21:57.316
This scandal of yours will soon pass.

21:59.026 --> 22:00.110
I look forward to the day

22:00.193 --> 22:02.321
when things'll return
to how they used to be between us.

22:18.920 --> 22:21.590
Bridgerton. Tessa. Mind if I join you?

22:21.673 --> 22:22.966
The more the merrier.

22:23.050 --> 22:25.552
Mr. Bridgerton will be happy
to have you here

22:25.635 --> 22:27.846
before the two "me's" gang up on him.

22:27.929 --> 22:28.847
The…

22:29.765 --> 22:31.516
-Uh, just--
-Mm-hmm.

22:36.688 --> 22:38.732
-It's remarkable.

22:38.815 --> 22:40.734
I should think it your best work to date.

22:40.817 --> 22:43.236
Well, perhaps we have all earned a drink.

22:44.780 --> 22:47.407
I am glad to see
you blossoming, Bridgerton.

22:47.491 --> 22:50.911
I think many of us at the Academy
assumed you'd be all drink and no paint.

22:50.994 --> 22:52.704
Why ever would they assume that?

22:53.288 --> 22:55.540
Considering your acceptance.

22:55.624 --> 22:58.085
How it was based on, well, you know…

22:58.168 --> 22:59.169
Rupert.

22:59.252 --> 23:00.712
What-- Enlighten me.

23:01.505 --> 23:02.798
Please. Wha--

23:05.384 --> 23:08.345
Your brother's
large donation to the Academy.

23:08.428 --> 23:10.305
It's what secured your place.

23:11.306 --> 23:12.766
I thought you knew.

23:47.676 --> 23:49.010
Lord Bridgerton.

23:51.346 --> 23:53.056
I'm glad to see you're awake.

23:56.643 --> 23:59.980
I hear it was you who found me
and brought me home safe.

24:00.063 --> 24:03.066
I suppose I must be grateful
for our very first race in the park.

24:04.609 --> 24:06.611
If it were not for that fateful moment,

24:08.280 --> 24:10.449
who knows what else could have happened?

24:11.032 --> 24:11.992
Hmm.

24:16.246 --> 24:17.789
Thank you for the flowers.

24:22.836 --> 24:24.838
Was there something else, my lord?

24:29.801 --> 24:30.844
I called on you.

24:33.263 --> 24:34.264
The morning after.

24:37.726 --> 24:39.436
I called on you to apologize.

24:40.645 --> 24:43.398
You deserved so much more than that.

24:46.443 --> 24:48.778
I took liberties. I…

24:50.197 --> 24:53.283
I did not want it to happen like that, so…

24:55.410 --> 24:57.329
-I came to apologize.
-Yes, you already said--

24:57.412 --> 24:58.663
And to ask you to marry me.

24:59.998 --> 25:00.832
Uh--

25:01.708 --> 25:03.043
Miss Sharma.

25:03.126 --> 25:05.212
-I'm here, and I'm asking--
-What are you doing?

25:05.295 --> 25:07.964
No. My lord, I do not need you
to ask me anything at all.

25:08.048 --> 25:09.216
Kate. I…

25:09.299 --> 25:11.676
I am returning to India.

25:13.220 --> 25:15.388
The moment
I resolve matters with my sister,

25:16.264 --> 25:18.683
I am returning to India. It is decided.

25:31.279 --> 25:32.948
And your family's financial affairs?

25:33.031 --> 25:36.201
Lady Danbury has offered to sponsor
my mother and sister for another season.

25:36.284 --> 25:38.411
I am certain they will do
perfectly well on their own,

25:38.495 --> 25:40.288
as it is clear I am of no help.

25:46.253 --> 25:47.379
You are running away.

25:49.214 --> 25:50.173
Please go.

25:53.176 --> 25:54.261
Go!

26:14.990 --> 26:17.158
Then perhaps
it could be the other modiste.

26:17.242 --> 26:19.244
The other modiste
was driven out of business in part

26:19.327 --> 26:21.079
by Lady Whistledown
praising Madame Delacroix.

26:21.162 --> 26:22.497
So she must be hiding something.

26:22.581 --> 26:25.417
Perhaps. But she is quite crafty.

26:25.500 --> 26:28.086
If Madame Delacroix is involved,
she will never admit it.

26:28.169 --> 26:30.463
Yet another clue
that will only lead nowhere.

26:33.300 --> 26:35.552
Oh. Do not bother yourself.

26:55.447 --> 26:56.448
Forgive me.

26:57.198 --> 26:58.033
I--

27:04.539 --> 27:05.457
This is absurd.

27:08.376 --> 27:11.921
-I would never--
-No, this whole thing, it is absurd. I--

27:13.798 --> 27:15.550
We cannot continue to meet like this.

27:15.634 --> 27:17.302
-This was your idea.
-I know.

27:17.385 --> 27:18.553
I…

27:18.637 --> 27:19.721
I know it was.

27:20.305 --> 27:23.808
And I am sorry for wasting your time.

27:24.434 --> 27:25.268
Are you?

27:26.353 --> 27:29.147
Or are you suddenly dropping
out of this hunt for other reasons?

27:30.273 --> 27:32.317
People are already talking about us, Theo.

27:33.485 --> 27:36.029
And, no, I do not normally care
what other people think, but, yes,

27:36.946 --> 27:38.156
I care about you.

27:39.157 --> 27:41.159
And if we continue on like this,

27:41.993 --> 27:43.203
I could not live with myself

27:43.286 --> 27:45.288
if you are the one
who has to face the consequences.

27:46.623 --> 27:47.916
I should have known.

27:50.043 --> 27:53.213
That you could not be
any different from all other ladies.

27:55.173 --> 27:56.716
It's all right, Miss Bridgerton.

27:57.384 --> 28:01.179
You dipped your toe into my waters,
trying to make yourself feel better

28:01.262 --> 28:03.431
about the unearned
advantages of your birth.

28:05.975 --> 28:07.602
Now you can go back to your life,

28:08.311 --> 28:10.271
and I can go back to mine.

28:17.904 --> 28:20.782
I'm sorry I couldn't help you
find your writer.

28:22.575 --> 28:23.993
Best of luck.

28:25.537 --> 28:26.663
Theo.

28:58.778 --> 28:59.779
Kate!

29:00.447 --> 29:03.575
-You should not be up on your own.
-I am feeling much improved.

29:04.492 --> 29:08.997
The most rested I have felt in years,
after a week in bed, in fact.

29:09.080 --> 29:11.332
It has been a rather strenuous season.

29:11.416 --> 29:15.837
Edwina, I know earning
your trust again will not be simple.

29:18.131 --> 29:22.010
But I am willing to continue to try,
however long it might take.

29:24.763 --> 29:28.433
When you were unwell,
all I cared about was you getting better.

29:29.434 --> 29:31.978
But now that you are, I do have questions.

29:41.488 --> 29:44.115
Was there always something
between you and the viscount?

29:44.199 --> 29:46.034
Were you lying to me all along?

29:46.117 --> 29:47.869
I was lying to myself.

29:51.164 --> 29:52.123
Perhaps…

29:54.459 --> 29:57.504
there was something between us, but

29:58.713 --> 30:00.924
I truly did not know it
until it was too late.

30:01.007 --> 30:03.510
But once you knew,
why did you not tell me?

30:03.593 --> 30:06.387
Why wait for me
to put it together on my own like a fool?

30:06.471 --> 30:08.264
I thought I could deny my feelings.

30:09.098 --> 30:10.892
-But--
-They were too strong.

30:14.187 --> 30:16.564
When I found out about your accident,

30:17.899 --> 30:20.944
all I could think of
is how I do not even know you.

30:22.445 --> 30:24.405
Nor do you know yourself.

30:25.198 --> 30:27.992
Kate, I am done with playing a part.

30:28.743 --> 30:32.372
I want to know myself, truly,
and to know who you are too.

30:33.039 --> 30:37.001
Because I am unsure I like
the young ladies we've both been playing.

30:43.383 --> 30:47.762
Might we bring our new selves to this ball
the Featheringtons are giving tonight?

30:47.846 --> 30:48.847
Oh, Bon…

30:48.930 --> 30:51.099
I do not want you to attend for me.

30:51.182 --> 30:52.934
Whatever action you now wish to take,

30:53.017 --> 30:56.312
I only hope it is because
you are being truthful to yourself,

30:57.188 --> 30:58.815
and not because of anyone else.

31:30.221 --> 31:32.932
You seem to have
the melancholy of heartbreak about you.

31:33.016 --> 31:34.809
What would you know about heartbreak?

31:37.270 --> 31:39.022
I would not, really.

31:43.568 --> 31:47.322
But I have felt it in paintings.

31:47.405 --> 31:49.908
In a Gainsborough portrait or…

31:50.742 --> 31:52.368
…a Turner sky.

31:53.661 --> 31:56.039
And what does one feel in a Bridgerton?

32:00.251 --> 32:01.544
Disappointment.

32:04.422 --> 32:07.467
-Lack of inspiration.
-Art Academy not going so well?

32:09.302 --> 32:10.845
I am an impostor, El.

32:11.512 --> 32:14.724
Turns out Anthony himself
bought my seat at that table.

32:19.520 --> 32:22.231
That does not mean you would not
have been accepted on your own.

32:26.110 --> 32:28.905
I, too, know what it is like
to feel oneself an imposter.

32:29.906 --> 32:32.659
Parading around ballrooms
in feathered frocks,

32:32.742 --> 32:34.786
pretending to be someone I am not.

32:36.371 --> 32:38.957
I truly do not want to go
to this dreadful ball tonight,

32:39.040 --> 32:40.458
even if I know Pen will be there.

32:40.541 --> 32:43.628
She finds me
quite foolish too, at present.

32:46.214 --> 32:47.382
Would you like a companion?

32:48.049 --> 32:49.801
What? Of course I would not.

32:49.884 --> 32:53.012
Because… I am apparently free.

32:54.973 --> 32:56.599
Impostor party of two?

32:57.141 --> 32:58.393
Hmm.

33:12.115 --> 33:12.949
Brother.

33:13.491 --> 33:14.325
Gregory.

33:15.034 --> 33:16.411
Should you not be in bed?

33:16.911 --> 33:17.996
I cannot sleep.

33:18.079 --> 33:19.414
Is something wrong?

33:19.497 --> 33:20.999
My Latin teacher believes so.

33:21.624 --> 33:22.709
He yelled at me.

33:23.334 --> 33:25.211
Thinks I am stupid.

33:28.715 --> 33:30.800
I am sorry for disturbing you.

33:30.883 --> 33:32.427
-I shall--
-Gregory, wait.

33:33.803 --> 33:34.762
Come here.

33:36.222 --> 33:37.098
Come here.

33:41.394 --> 33:43.896
Your Latin tutor
does not think you are stupid.

33:43.980 --> 33:45.773
He thinks I am frightening.

33:49.652 --> 33:51.904
I ask too much of him, and of you.

33:53.740 --> 33:54.907
And of everyone, really.

34:05.501 --> 34:07.712
Am I like him at all?

34:08.588 --> 34:09.714
Or was he more like you?

34:11.090 --> 34:11.924
Father.

34:21.434 --> 34:22.435
He was, um…

34:26.814 --> 34:28.399
He was like both of us, really.

34:29.025 --> 34:31.277
He had my seriousness, perhaps.

34:33.279 --> 34:35.406
He shared your love of a prank.

34:35.490 --> 34:36.491
Did he?

34:38.826 --> 34:41.704
He once put glue in Benedict's shoes.

34:46.334 --> 34:48.252
I wish I could have played a prank on him.

34:56.677 --> 34:57.845
I wish so too.

35:03.976 --> 35:06.395
We do not talk
about him enough, do we?

35:07.188 --> 35:09.398
I do not know
much about him at all.

35:09.482 --> 35:12.568
That is because
I have shown up far too late

35:12.652 --> 35:14.403
for far too many things.

35:23.579 --> 35:25.748
Your father was
the best man I've ever known.

35:29.585 --> 35:31.504
He was good for a laugh, of course, but…

35:34.715 --> 35:37.969
he was courageous,
and never afraid to fight.

35:38.052 --> 35:39.554
Not just for his family,

35:41.305 --> 35:43.349
but for everything else too.

35:59.657 --> 36:00.616
Dearest.

36:01.659 --> 36:03.077
How are you feeling?

36:03.161 --> 36:04.662
Oh. Well.

36:04.745 --> 36:06.831
-Uh, I am feeling well.
-Oh.

36:07.582 --> 36:09.375
I see you are not yet dressed
for the ball.

36:09.458 --> 36:11.210
I have much to pack before I depart,

36:11.294 --> 36:14.672
and I am still unsure
whether I would like to attend tonight.

36:16.716 --> 36:17.550
Kate.

36:19.093 --> 36:20.595
I hope your return to India

36:20.678 --> 36:24.473
is not because of some eagerness
to flee what is difficult.

36:24.557 --> 36:26.100
I know the feeling too well,

36:26.184 --> 36:29.020
and I can tell you,
it is never the wise choice.

36:30.980 --> 36:32.356
Oh…

36:32.440 --> 36:35.651
-Oh, I hate seeing you like this.
-It is my fault, Mama.

36:36.652 --> 36:39.780
-Everything that has happened.
-Edwina forgives you. I forgive you.

36:39.864 --> 36:43.242
But I do not forgive myself.
I was supposed to help her.

36:43.326 --> 36:45.077
To help our family, and instead--

36:45.161 --> 36:48.080
It is not right that you were left
to guide Edwina alone.

36:48.164 --> 36:49.540
That was my failing.

36:49.624 --> 36:51.792
-You were grieving Appa.
-But so were you.

36:52.627 --> 36:55.254
And after you had already
lost your mother too. Kate…

36:55.338 --> 36:56.964
You took me in as your own.

36:58.007 --> 37:02.637
And you never treated me any differently.
Everything I… I did, I owed it to you.

37:02.720 --> 37:04.388
You owed me nothing.

37:05.139 --> 37:06.307
Oh…

37:06.974 --> 37:10.394
You never had to earn your place
in this family.

37:10.478 --> 37:12.772
I loved you from the day I met you.

37:13.356 --> 37:16.609
Oh, love is not something
that is ever owed.

37:17.109 --> 37:20.655
You came into my life… as a daughter,

37:20.738 --> 37:23.574
and I never saw you as anything else.

37:24.367 --> 37:25.409
Oh, I--

37:26.035 --> 37:30.915
It grieves me to think you do not believe
you deserve all of the love in the world.

37:44.762 --> 37:46.973
He was going to ask me to marry him.

37:48.516 --> 37:49.684
The viscount.

37:49.767 --> 37:52.687
-What?
-And I could not allow it, Mama.

37:53.479 --> 37:55.564
He was going to ask me
out of mere obligation,

37:55.648 --> 37:59.318
some misguided notion
of duty after the two of us…

38:08.244 --> 38:10.496
He does not love me, Mama.

38:14.333 --> 38:15.626
Oh, and I…

38:16.460 --> 38:18.546
I could not allow it.

38:18.629 --> 38:20.047
Oh…

38:24.719 --> 38:26.429
My darling, my darling…

38:46.532 --> 38:47.616
Exquisite.

38:48.534 --> 38:49.577
Is it not?

38:49.660 --> 38:53.664
We might think it a foretaste
of my wedding to Cousin Jack, I suppose.

38:53.748 --> 38:55.750
Might he finally dance with me tonight?

38:55.833 --> 38:58.377
Not if he knows what is best for him.

38:59.086 --> 39:01.630
Oh, I shall swoon.

39:02.131 --> 39:04.884
This ball is truly
my crowning achievement.

39:10.473 --> 39:11.515
Your Majesty.

39:22.401 --> 39:25.112
I-- I cannot do this tonight.

39:25.196 --> 39:27.490
I am sorry, Mama.
I fear I must disappoint you yet again.

39:27.573 --> 39:30.117
The only thing that'd
disappoint me is seeing you care

39:30.201 --> 39:31.702
what anyone else thinks.

39:32.328 --> 39:33.871
That would not be you.

39:35.581 --> 39:38.584
I do not want you
keeping things from me ever again.

39:39.126 --> 39:40.044
Now,

39:41.504 --> 39:43.255
you have come thus far this season.

39:43.339 --> 39:46.133
It would be
a shame for you to turn back now.

39:46.217 --> 39:47.093
Steady.

39:48.844 --> 39:49.720
And ready.

40:16.789 --> 40:20.209
Fife had his lady friend
in a closet, apparently.

40:20.292 --> 40:23.212
-For 20 minutes, if you can believe it.

40:27.591 --> 40:28.509
Pen.

40:28.592 --> 40:30.136
Ooh. El.

40:30.928 --> 40:32.930
-Enjoying your evening?

40:33.013 --> 40:34.432
Me neither.

40:37.977 --> 40:40.855
You were correct… about Theo.

40:40.938 --> 40:43.774
It was a mistake,
ever getting involved with him.

40:44.483 --> 40:46.777
I took your advice,
and I extricated myself.

40:47.778 --> 40:50.656
He did not take it well,
but I think it was the necessary choice.

40:50.739 --> 40:54.118
-Eloise--
-Thank you… for protecting me.

40:54.743 --> 40:56.078
You are a true friend.

40:59.540 --> 41:02.209
-So your Lady Whistledown search--
-…is over.

41:02.293 --> 41:04.545
She is gone for good.

41:04.628 --> 41:06.755
I suppose now
we can finally speak of other things.

41:10.885 --> 41:12.720
Perhaps we might speak of Lord Fife.

41:13.220 --> 41:16.599
I hear he recently spent a good
deal of time with Miss Goring in a closet.

41:16.682 --> 41:17.808
For what, I cannot imagine.

41:19.059 --> 41:20.394
Wherever did you hear that?

41:20.478 --> 41:22.605
Miss Goring is over there,
alongside the lemonade table,

41:22.688 --> 41:24.732
secretly fixing tissue paper in her bosom.

41:24.815 --> 41:26.400
Now we know who for. Look.

41:30.070 --> 41:31.572
What a keen observation, Pen.

41:31.655 --> 41:32.907
Mmm.

41:53.010 --> 41:54.803
I am glad you decided to come.

41:55.763 --> 41:59.016
I could not miss out
on one last evening with you before I go.

42:06.357 --> 42:07.733
Then what do you say?

42:07.816 --> 42:09.777
Might we take to the dance floor?

42:11.445 --> 42:12.947
-With whom?
-Ourselves.

42:14.073 --> 42:17.618
They cannot possibly say anything
about us that we have not heard before.

42:17.701 --> 42:21.580
And should your brush with death
not be our best social capital yet?

42:56.198 --> 42:58.784
You realize you're dancing
with a ruined Bridgerton, Miss Cowper?

42:58.867 --> 43:00.786
I enjoy keeping people alert.

43:01.787 --> 43:03.998
And I enjoy
that beautiful necklace you are wearing.

43:04.081 --> 43:06.208
A gift from Lord Featherington?

43:06.292 --> 43:07.876
Seventeen rubies, in fact.

43:08.711 --> 43:10.754
Do you grow jealous, Mr. Bridgerton?

43:11.630 --> 43:12.923
Mmm, dazzling.

43:13.007 --> 43:15.593
-Except the clasp is broken.
-Is it?

43:15.676 --> 43:17.303
Might I mend it for you?

43:17.803 --> 43:19.972
The Bridgerton valet
has a way with jewelry.

43:20.639 --> 43:24.310
You would not be making up
an excuse just to call on me, would you?

43:33.152 --> 43:34.236
Come with me.

43:43.203 --> 43:45.748
Colin, it could be thought
quite scandalous for the two of us--

43:45.831 --> 43:49.668
There are no gemstone mines in Georgia.
Your cousin, Lord Featherington,

43:49.752 --> 43:51.795
I'm sorry to be the one
to tell you this, Pen, but,

43:52.504 --> 43:54.214
well, I have looked into him.

43:54.298 --> 43:56.091
I believe he is nothing
but a mere charlatan.

43:56.175 --> 43:58.093
What? What are you saying?

43:58.177 --> 44:00.429
I am saying,
if I am right, then this necklace--

44:01.013 --> 44:04.433
-Penelope? Mr. Bridgerton?
-What is the meaning of this?

44:06.060 --> 44:07.353
The meaning is…

44:11.106 --> 44:13.942
…that this necklace
is a fraud, made of glass.

44:14.568 --> 44:15.486
Just like you.

44:16.362 --> 44:18.989
How dare you take advantage
of these poor ladies Featherington,

44:19.073 --> 44:21.408
without a father
or a husband to protect them?

44:22.076 --> 44:24.870
It is out of concern
for their reputation alone

44:24.953 --> 44:26.789
that I will only address
this matter in private.

44:26.872 --> 44:31.001
But I expect you to return
all of the funds you have collected,

44:31.085 --> 44:33.003
and leave town at once.

44:37.675 --> 44:38.509
Mama?

44:39.468 --> 44:43.097
I'll deal with this.
Thank goodness for Mr. Bridgerton.

44:51.021 --> 44:53.273
We must accelerate our plans.

44:53.357 --> 44:55.150
The money is packed into the chest.

44:55.234 --> 44:59.029
We will finish the evening and catch
the first ship tomorrow to the Americas.

44:59.113 --> 45:01.365
Tomorrow? But that's
much too soon, my lord.

45:01.448 --> 45:02.950
And what about my young ladies?

45:03.033 --> 45:05.911
-We shall send for them after.
-After? After what?

45:05.994 --> 45:09.123
Well, they can come with us.
Although I am certain it will be hard

45:09.206 --> 45:12.084
to convince them
of a midnight flit to the Southern states.

45:14.044 --> 45:16.088
In some ways, this will be a relief.

45:17.256 --> 45:21.009
I will no longer have to go through
with my proposed marriage to Prudence.

45:21.593 --> 45:25.222
There will be other
possibilities for the future.

45:26.056 --> 45:26.932
Yes?

45:34.106 --> 45:36.024
We should return to the party.

45:47.619 --> 45:49.329
-Colin.
-Are you all right?

45:49.413 --> 45:50.706
-I believe so.
-Good.

45:50.789 --> 45:52.958
Because we are dancing.

45:53.459 --> 45:54.376
Hmm.

45:56.712 --> 45:59.506
I had been rehearsing
that speech in my mind for hours.

45:59.590 --> 46:02.551
If your cousin does not return the money
and leave your family alone,

46:02.634 --> 46:04.636
I will have another thing to say to him.

46:05.220 --> 46:06.930
You were astonishing, Colin.

46:07.431 --> 46:09.349
I cannot thank you enough
for looking after us.

46:09.433 --> 46:11.769
I will always look after you, Penelope.

46:13.020 --> 46:14.521
You are special to me.

46:14.605 --> 46:17.191
As are you… to me.

46:44.927 --> 46:47.262
You will not be able
to avoid him all night, Didi.

46:49.389 --> 46:51.350
And you should not attempt to.

46:51.433 --> 46:53.268
At least, not on my behalf.

46:54.728 --> 46:57.147
Be the sister I know that you are.

46:57.731 --> 47:01.026
Be funny and brave and feeling.

47:02.069 --> 47:05.531
Be unafraid to follow your heart
after doing the exact opposite

47:05.614 --> 47:06.949
for far too long.

47:07.950 --> 47:11.537
You have spent so much
of your time shining your light on me.

47:13.497 --> 47:16.500
It is time for you
to shine all on your own.

47:32.015 --> 47:33.100
Lord Bridgerton.

47:34.852 --> 47:35.978
Miss Sharma.

47:40.107 --> 47:41.775
I was just on my way outside.

47:48.657 --> 47:51.702
We should continue to keep
our distance between us, in light of the…

47:56.373 --> 47:57.708
Perhaps we should not.

48:00.043 --> 48:03.171
Perhaps the spectators
might take pity on me.

48:03.964 --> 48:05.507
I was on the dance floor

48:06.091 --> 48:08.594
days after a terrible injury to the head.

48:10.512 --> 48:12.639
Perhaps I needed someone to steady me.

48:15.100 --> 48:16.685
Make sure I was all right.

48:20.731 --> 48:22.941
Perhaps you were the first person I found.

48:27.404 --> 48:28.530
How many?

48:29.448 --> 48:30.490
Three.

48:36.371 --> 48:38.248
Are you going to ask me to dance?

48:39.541 --> 48:40.542
One last time?

48:42.085 --> 48:43.670
Are you going to say yes?

49:27.631 --> 49:29.049
Do you want to stop?

49:32.761 --> 49:34.179
Just keep looking at me.

49:37.140 --> 49:38.475
No one else matters.

49:57.494 --> 49:59.746
What a scandal.

50:00.580 --> 50:03.750
Is <i>that </i>why
the sister's wedding was abandoned?

50:03.834 --> 50:05.502
Oh, child, no.

50:05.585 --> 50:10.090
That wedding did not happen
because <i>I </i>simply changed my mind.

50:10.173 --> 50:13.385
A fact Lady Whistledown
must have somehow missed.

50:14.136 --> 50:16.638
I think they look beautiful together.

50:16.722 --> 50:18.181
Beautiful, indeed.

50:18.849 --> 50:20.100
Do they not?

50:22.310 --> 50:23.603
Do they not?

50:23.687 --> 50:25.355
-Or course, Your Majesty.
-Indeed.

50:25.439 --> 50:26.773
Yes, Your Majesty.

50:26.857 --> 50:29.484
Then why is no one else dancing?

50:36.074 --> 50:36.908
Miss Edwina,

50:37.701 --> 50:40.037
have I yet told you about my nephew?

50:41.663 --> 50:42.956
He is a prince.

50:44.708 --> 50:46.418
And he is available.

51:39.513 --> 51:43.266
Everyone, outside.
I have a surprise for you all.

52:24.641 --> 52:25.517
Eloise.

52:29.187 --> 52:31.022
Where did you get all of this money?

52:31.606 --> 52:33.233
What are you doing
going through my things?

52:33.316 --> 52:34.860
Answer… me.

52:37.612 --> 52:39.865
-It's none of your business.

52:40.699 --> 52:42.826
It's none of my business. I see.

52:44.911 --> 52:48.790
And what exactly is <i>your</i> business, Pen?

52:51.668 --> 52:54.421
Hearing you repeat
all that gossip tonight, it struck me,

52:55.088 --> 52:56.965
because I have never heard you like that.

52:57.716 --> 52:59.301
You might have said those things before,

52:59.384 --> 53:03.346
but tonight was the first time I,
in fact, <i>heard</i> you say them.

53:04.222 --> 53:06.016
It sounded so familiar.

53:07.142 --> 53:08.101
Your words.

53:08.685 --> 53:10.645
Not just the content or subject,

53:11.271 --> 53:12.439
but the pattern.

53:13.523 --> 53:15.901
It sounded written, almost.

53:17.444 --> 53:19.196
Why do you think that is?

53:19.279 --> 53:21.865
Because you have been reading
too much Whistledown.

53:22.657 --> 53:24.993
Her voice,
it is echoing in your head, Eloise.

53:25.076 --> 53:26.995
I thought so too, at first.

53:27.078 --> 53:29.122
But then I also thought

53:29.206 --> 53:31.791
about how you were
always clinging to that wall,

53:32.834 --> 53:35.921
collecting all sorts of morsels of gossip.

53:36.588 --> 53:38.131
How when I expressed my dislike

53:38.215 --> 53:40.675
for the naming of the diamond
at the beginning of the season,

53:40.759 --> 53:43.094
Whistledown disavowed
the whole thing shortly after.

53:43.595 --> 53:46.431
How<i> you</i> were one of the <i>only</i> people

53:46.514 --> 53:48.642
who could've known
about Miss Thompson's pregnancy.

53:48.725 --> 53:49.559
You could not--

53:49.643 --> 53:52.437
And then I thought about
how you said people have been talking

53:52.979 --> 53:54.189
about me and Theo.

53:55.357 --> 53:56.733
Only, if that were the case,

53:57.359 --> 53:59.486
Whistledown would have
written about it weeks ago.

54:00.654 --> 54:02.906
It is even why you chose
to work with Madame Delacroix.

54:02.989 --> 54:05.367
Because she was someone
I had already dismissed.

54:05.450 --> 54:08.161
Because this was personal.

54:10.288 --> 54:11.706
Eloise, I'm sorry.

54:13.291 --> 54:15.085
I'm so sorry.
You are right about all of it.

54:15.168 --> 54:17.587
-I was trying to protect you.
-Is that what you were doing?!

54:18.338 --> 54:20.590
By writing about me in your latest sheet?

54:21.091 --> 54:23.927
By telling the entire world
about things I trusted you with?

54:24.010 --> 54:27.097
Only to convince the queen it wasn't you.
It was the only way I could save you.

54:27.180 --> 54:29.599
The only person you were
interested in saving was yourself.

54:30.558 --> 54:33.019
All so you could keep making money,
at a cost to everyone else.

54:33.687 --> 54:36.731
At a cost to Miss Thompson. To my brother.

54:36.815 --> 54:40.360
To my entire family.
To <i>your</i> entire family.

54:40.443 --> 54:43.029
I ended my friendship
with Theo because of you!

54:44.030 --> 54:45.532
One of the only good things in my life,

54:45.615 --> 54:48.159
all because of
your self-serving manipulation!

54:48.243 --> 54:51.830
You have no idea how horrible
it has felt to keep this from you,

54:51.913 --> 54:54.207
from everyone, for so long!

54:54.833 --> 54:57.794
Whistledown has been
all I have had, and I have given it up.

54:57.877 --> 54:59.170
I am done with it.

55:00.672 --> 55:04.342
I wrote what I wrote,
and I gave it up for you.

55:05.844 --> 55:07.637
I do not even know you.

55:09.097 --> 55:12.767
I look at you now,
and all I feel is pity for you.

55:13.893 --> 55:16.646
Sequestered here in this very room,

55:16.730 --> 55:18.815
writing your secret little scandal sheet,

55:18.898 --> 55:21.568
tarnishing everyone in town
because you are too scared

55:21.651 --> 55:23.778
to stand up for yourself in reality.

55:25.363 --> 55:27.407
You are something, Penelope.

55:28.283 --> 55:30.118
An insipid wallflower, indeed.

55:33.538 --> 55:35.081
At least I did something.

55:38.209 --> 55:39.377
All you ever do

55:39.461 --> 55:41.713
is <i>talk </i>about doing something.

55:42.339 --> 55:44.424
You've all these great ambitions,
these great plans,

55:44.507 --> 55:48.303
but I am the one who did something great,
and you cannot stand it, can you?!

55:49.763 --> 55:51.765
And what do you think that makes you?

55:55.226 --> 55:59.856
I wish never to see or speak to you again.

56:15.038 --> 56:16.373
Just over there.

56:16.456 --> 56:18.917
The real celebrations will begin shortly.

56:24.130 --> 56:25.715
Well, if we do have to leave,

56:25.799 --> 56:28.635
at least we gave
a memorable farewell party.

56:32.055 --> 56:34.766
I gave a memorable farewell party

56:35.934 --> 56:36.810
for you.

56:38.895 --> 56:41.106
I've instructed the maids
to pack up all your things.

56:41.189 --> 56:43.108
Your essential things, at least,

56:43.191 --> 56:45.985
with enough money to get you
on a boat back to America

56:46.069 --> 56:47.487
and out of our lives.

56:48.738 --> 56:51.241
-I thought we were leaving together.
-No.

56:52.033 --> 56:54.327
You are leaving. Alone.

56:54.828 --> 56:57.872
-Portia--
-Never touch me again.

57:00.375 --> 57:02.419
Portia, we are a team.

57:03.128 --> 57:05.130
And an excellent one at that.

57:05.213 --> 57:06.631
Oh, I already have a team.

57:07.674 --> 57:11.469
They are three young ladies,
often nettling and contrary,

57:12.178 --> 57:13.346
but they are mine.

57:13.430 --> 57:15.974
And it is clear to me
that you do not care about them at all,

57:16.057 --> 57:19.352
so I am sending you away
with your favorite person. Yourself.

57:19.436 --> 57:23.314
This entire scheme
was as much your idea as mine.

57:24.357 --> 57:25.525
If not more.

57:25.608 --> 57:29.195
Do you honestly expect anyone to believe
that such a confident, well-spoken man

57:29.279 --> 57:31.990
needed a woman to help inform his plan?

57:32.073 --> 57:33.992
A woman who is a victim herself,

57:34.075 --> 57:37.454
having invested the last dregs
of her money into this very scheme.

57:37.537 --> 57:39.914
There is a record of it, my lord.

57:41.708 --> 57:44.461
I will keep a large share of the money

57:44.544 --> 57:47.255
to support myself and my young ladies,

57:47.338 --> 57:51.342
and I had Mrs. Varley
forge a signature on a document

57:51.426 --> 57:54.971
stating that as soon as
one of my girls has a son,

57:55.054 --> 57:56.723
the estate shall pass to them.

57:56.806 --> 57:59.142
Varley has excellent penmanship, you see.

58:00.435 --> 58:04.105
The ton, of course, will be infuriated
to discover that you have run away

58:04.189 --> 58:07.066
with all the money that you tricked
out of their trusting hands.

58:07.150 --> 58:10.403
You are welcome to try to explain it
to them, now that they're all gathered--

58:10.487 --> 58:12.363
You are cruel.

58:12.447 --> 58:14.991
I am a mother.

58:16.451 --> 58:19.496
And you are not leaving
any worse off than when you arrived.

58:20.914 --> 58:22.248
With nothing.

58:48.066 --> 58:49.442
Have you seen Eloise?

58:50.610 --> 58:51.694
Eloise Bridgerton?

58:58.117 --> 58:59.369
Penelope Featherington?

58:59.452 --> 59:02.247
The way you were dancing with her
looked rather interesting.

59:02.330 --> 59:05.041
-You courting the girl, Bridgerton?
-Ah. Are you mad?

59:05.124 --> 59:07.961
I would never dream
of courting Penelope Featherington.

59:08.044 --> 59:10.296
Not in your wildest fantasies, Fife.

59:18.221 --> 59:20.473
I've decided to leave the Academy.

59:20.557 --> 59:21.849
What?

59:21.933 --> 59:24.602
-Whatever for?
-I know about your donation, Brother.

59:25.103 --> 59:28.189
You were trying to help
in your own misguided way,

59:28.773 --> 59:32.026
perhaps because you sensed the truth,
which is that I'm simply not good enough.

59:32.110 --> 59:33.736
Stop. You're beginning to sound like me.

59:33.820 --> 59:36.447
If you want to paint, paint.

59:37.198 --> 59:39.284
It is one of your <i>many</i> talents.

59:39.367 --> 59:40.994
Chief among them, your natural gift

59:41.077 --> 59:43.705
for seeing what others need,
even when they cannot see it themselves.

59:44.956 --> 59:47.250
It's a gift that has taken me
far too long to recognize,

59:47.333 --> 59:50.545
but I would not have done…
if it were not for you.

59:54.090 --> 59:55.675
Enjoy the rest of your evening, Brother.

1:00:20.783 --> 1:00:23.036
Are you still planning to leave for India?

1:00:23.786 --> 1:00:27.165
I have my sister's blessing,
as well as my mother's.

1:00:27.248 --> 1:00:30.376
And the queen herself has apparently
saved our families from utter ruin.

1:00:32.378 --> 1:00:33.921
You love your family dearly.

1:00:34.714 --> 1:00:36.674
As much as you love yours.

1:00:39.302 --> 1:00:41.012
I was fearful of losing you.

1:00:42.805 --> 1:00:45.433
It is why I could not visit you
after your accident.

1:00:46.809 --> 1:00:48.519
I could not bring myself to--

1:00:53.733 --> 1:00:54.942
I love you.

1:00:55.985 --> 1:00:58.488
I've loved you from the moment
we raced each other in that park.

1:00:58.571 --> 1:01:00.365
I've loved you at every dance,

1:01:00.448 --> 1:01:02.241
on every walk,
every time we've been together,

1:01:02.325 --> 1:01:05.536
and every time we've been apart.
You do not have to accept it or embrace it

1:01:05.620 --> 1:01:07.830
or even allow it.
Knowing you, you probably will not.

1:01:07.914 --> 1:01:09.165
But you must know it,

1:01:09.916 --> 1:01:11.125
in your heart.

1:01:13.378 --> 1:01:15.213
You must feel it because I do.

1:01:19.509 --> 1:01:20.802
I love you.

1:01:27.433 --> 1:01:29.936
-I do not know what to say.
-You do not have to say anything.

1:01:30.019 --> 1:01:33.106
I do not think
there is anything else to say…

1:01:35.274 --> 1:01:37.026
other than I love you too.

1:01:42.031 --> 1:01:44.200
I want a life that suits us both.

1:01:46.202 --> 1:01:47.662
I know I am imperfect,

1:01:47.745 --> 1:01:50.581
but I will humble myself before you

1:01:50.665 --> 1:01:53.584
because I cannot
imagine my life without you,

1:01:53.668 --> 1:01:55.503
and that is why I wish to marry you.

1:01:59.465 --> 1:02:01.968
You do know there will never be a day

1:02:02.051 --> 1:02:04.095
where you do not vex me.

1:02:07.682 --> 1:02:10.059
Is that a promise, Kathani Sharma?

1:02:18.693 --> 1:02:19.569
Yes.

1:02:21.654 --> 1:02:23.156
Yes, it is a promise.

1:02:23.239 --> 1:02:24.323
Well, then.

1:02:26.033 --> 1:02:28.870
It seems the two of us are finally
seeing eye-to-eye on something.

1:02:29.454 --> 1:02:30.413
I suppose we are.

1:02:56.147 --> 1:02:57.648
<i>It has been said</i>

1:02:58.649 --> 1:03:01.527
<i>that silence can wield</i>
<i>more power than words.</i>

1:03:03.988 --> 1:03:06.324
<i>No one knows that better than me.</i>

1:03:12.663 --> 1:03:15.041
You were right
about the new Lord Featherington.

1:03:15.917 --> 1:03:18.085
I must apologize
for how I acted the other day.

1:03:18.169 --> 1:03:20.254
It was what I needed to do
in order to gain his trust.

1:03:20.338 --> 1:03:21.798
A win I do not relish.

1:03:22.799 --> 1:03:23.966
No.

1:03:24.050 --> 1:03:26.636
Well, perhaps you should
pour yourself something as well.

1:03:28.513 --> 1:03:31.516
I told them this place was run
by an honorable man

1:03:31.599 --> 1:03:33.351
who serves a good drink.

1:03:33.434 --> 1:03:34.936
They demanded to come.

1:03:36.646 --> 1:03:38.856
I am in your debt now, Mr. Mondrich.

1:03:41.150 --> 1:03:42.026
Thank you.

1:03:43.861 --> 1:03:45.321
Roll your sleeves up, Will.

1:03:45.863 --> 1:03:47.198
We have customers.

1:03:51.035 --> 1:03:53.955
<i>It is in silence</i>
<i>where one may find truth.</i>

1:03:55.331 --> 1:03:59.043
<i>All one has to do, I suppose…</i>
<i>is listen for it.</i>

1:04:28.447 --> 1:04:33.244
<i>I know there will always</i>
<i>be times when silence is necessary.</i>

1:04:35.872 --> 1:04:39.584
<i>And, of course, times when it is not.</i>

1:04:53.681 --> 1:04:58.019
<i>Gentle reader,</i>
<i>you thought I was silenced,</i>

1:04:58.102 --> 1:05:00.313
<i>but you thought wrong.</i>

1:05:00.396 --> 1:05:03.357
<i>And if there is</i>
<i>one thing you should know by now,</i>

1:05:03.441 --> 1:05:07.778
<i>it is that this author</i>
<i>cannot keep quiet for long.</i>

1:05:08.613 --> 1:05:10.197
<i>Yours truly,</i>

1:05:11.115 --> 1:05:13.284
<i>Lady Whistledown.</i>

1:05:27.340 --> 1:05:28.382
Mmm.

1:05:30.092 --> 1:05:32.136
-Viscountess.

1:05:32.219 --> 1:05:34.722
-You seem to have outdone yourself today.

1:05:36.098 --> 1:05:39.727
You do know my duties
are particularly important to me.

1:05:40.478 --> 1:05:43.064
-Perhaps you'd like to go again.

1:05:43.147 --> 1:05:45.650
Seeing as you are so very

1:05:46.233 --> 1:05:47.151
dutiful.

1:05:47.234 --> 1:05:48.235
Mmm.

1:05:51.906 --> 1:05:53.616
Well, what would be dutiful

1:05:55.034 --> 1:05:59.205
is meeting your family outside
before they realize we are ignoring them.

1:06:05.670 --> 1:06:06.671
Mmm.

1:06:16.305 --> 1:06:18.432
-Oh!
-Yes! Look at you!

1:06:18.516 --> 1:06:20.643
-Yes! You're walking.
-Ooh!

1:06:20.726 --> 1:06:22.353
Away traveling for six months.

1:06:22.436 --> 1:06:24.313
Now they take six hours
coming down the stairs.

1:06:24.397 --> 1:06:26.357
Six is nothing when you are a newlywed.

1:06:26.440 --> 1:06:28.567
Ah! Here they are.

1:06:28.651 --> 1:06:29.735
Yes.

1:06:30.903 --> 1:06:32.154
And not a moment too soon.

1:06:33.531 --> 1:06:35.157
Perhaps we may begin playing?

1:06:35.241 --> 1:06:38.119
Hoping to get
your inevitable defeat over with, Brother?

1:06:38.202 --> 1:06:41.122
Right, we've all picked,
but left the mallet of death.

1:06:41.205 --> 1:06:43.040
-Oh, for me!
-For me!

1:06:44.542 --> 1:06:46.961
-Never mind.
-Probably keep to pink, Anthony.

1:06:47.044 --> 1:06:50.256
I rather think it will match the shade
of your embarrassment when you use it.

1:06:50.339 --> 1:06:51.590
Now, who is to begin?

1:06:51.674 --> 1:06:52.800
-Newton!

1:06:54.010 --> 1:06:55.386
I suppose he is.

1:06:55.469 --> 1:06:56.804
-Newton!
-Newton!

1:06:56.887 --> 1:06:59.015
I presume that means
the game has finally started, then.

1:06:59.598 --> 1:07:02.685
-You do know that was your turn he took.
-It absolutely was not.

1:07:02.768 --> 1:07:04.603
-He is your dog.
-And yours through marriage.

1:07:04.687 --> 1:07:06.939
I do not recall ever making
such an agreement.

1:07:07.023 --> 1:07:09.108
Well, that is between you and him.

1:07:09.191 --> 1:07:11.068
He does not listen to me.

1:07:11.152 --> 1:07:12.778
You believe I do?

1:07:17.575 --> 1:07:19.243
I suppose that means they are cutting out.

1:07:19.326 --> 1:07:21.245
-No! We're not cutting out!
-No, not a chance!

1:07:22.538 --> 1:07:25.207
Unless we want to take
this opportunity to return upstairs?

1:07:25.958 --> 1:07:27.418
And admit defeat?

1:07:28.210 --> 1:07:29.211
Never.
