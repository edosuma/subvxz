01:13.970 --> 01:15.239
Hello?

01:18.710 --> 01:20.006
Hello?

01:20.141 --> 01:21.907
Hey.

01:23.143 --> 01:26.316
- Stay away
from me! Stay away from me!

01:35.261 --> 01:37.261
How many
of you can hear me?

01:40.234 --> 01:41.865
Why is everyone quiet
all of a sudden?

01:42.001 --> 01:43.466
How many of you are there?

01:44.002 --> 01:45.163
I'm here.

01:45.298 --> 01:46.303
I'm here.

01:48.375 --> 01:50.335
Look, I'm not
here to hurt anyone, okay?

01:50.471 --> 01:52.371
Okay, I just woke up here.

01:52.507 --> 01:53.772
I don't know what's going on.

01:53.907 --> 01:56.273
I'm just trying to
figure this out, okay?

01:56.408 --> 01:57.710
Okay.

01:58.446 --> 02:00.350
I don't know where I am either.

02:01.419 --> 02:03.984
What's the last
thing you remember?

02:04.120 --> 02:05.619
I don't know.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.259
My head hurts.

02:09.491 --> 02:11.592
Me too, just try to remember.

02:14.164 --> 02:15.629
I was home.

02:19.533 --> 02:21.569
Then the last thing I remember.

02:23.810 --> 02:24.902
I'm freezing.

02:28.507 --> 02:29.610
It's okay.

02:32.116 --> 02:33.850
I'm wearing a jacket.

02:33.986 --> 02:34.978
I'll give it to you.

02:35.948 --> 02:37.816
Follow the sound
of my voice, okay?

02:39.121 --> 02:40.621
Okay.

02:41.895 --> 02:43.729
Can you walk?

02:43.864 --> 02:45.223
I'm coming toward you.

02:45.359 --> 02:46.258
- I can't see

02:46.394 --> 02:48.200
Okay, I'm coming to you.

02:52.100 --> 02:53.871
Sorry.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.035
That's my hand.

02:55.171 --> 02:56.736
Sorry.

02:56.871 --> 02:59.640
At least I found you.
There's two of us.

03:02.711 --> 03:04.645
I'm giving you my
jacket, put it on.

03:10.324 --> 03:12.624
I heard at least two
other voices before.

03:12.760 --> 03:14.391
Where are you?

03:15.491 --> 03:18.361
Hello?
- Please don't leave me.

03:18.497 --> 03:21.195
Where are
you, say something.

03:21.331 --> 03:22.428
Anyone remember anything?

03:22.563 --> 03:24.463
Anyone see a light or anything?

03:24.598 --> 03:28.470
I just woke up here in darkness.

03:28.605 --> 03:30.402
Just keep talking
so I can find you.

03:30.538 --> 03:31.435
Don't leave me.

03:31.571 --> 03:32.607
I'm scared, please.

03:56.366 --> 03:58.732
- What the hell?

04:37.140 --> 04:38.574
- Where are we?

04:48.956 --> 04:50.520
Can anyone hear me?

04:54.387 --> 04:55.657
- Whoa.

05:18.678 --> 05:19.879
- Hey, give me that.

05:22.719 --> 05:25.082
- And why would I
want to do that?

05:27.323 --> 05:29.790
Fine, take it.

05:51.744 --> 05:52.978
What's wrong with him?

05:54.280 --> 05:57.389
- I don't know, maybe
something they drugged us with.

06:05.327 --> 06:07.127
You're okay.

06:07.262 --> 06:10.094
What?

06:11.632 --> 06:12.598
Just calm down.

06:12.734 --> 06:13.631
We all just woke up here too.

06:13.767 --> 06:15.099
We're not gonna hurt you.

06:21.075 --> 06:23.580
- Stay back.
- Just take it easy, man.

06:38.658 --> 06:39.695
- Hey!

06:42.069 --> 06:43.732
Let me out of here!

06:54.576 --> 06:55.876
- Hey, are you okay?

07:01.054 --> 07:01.948
Are you pregnant?

07:03.186 --> 07:04.016
- Yeah.

07:11.230 --> 07:14.198
- I already tried that.

07:14.334 --> 07:16.897
- Hey, she's fucking pregnant.

07:19.371 --> 07:21.638
- Someone give her their weapon.

07:24.771 --> 07:26.207
Give her your machete.

07:26.342 --> 07:27.875
- Wait a minute.

07:29.109 --> 07:31.912
Give that pregnant
lady your machete.

07:33.315 --> 07:34.211
Why?

07:35.754 --> 07:39.216
Because a girl with
a gun told you to.

07:41.023 --> 07:44.522
Give it to her, I'm not
going to say it again.

07:44.658 --> 07:46.597
- Okay, okay.

07:48.168 --> 07:50.161
I'm not the enemy here.

07:53.006 --> 07:53.934
Thank you.

07:55.435 --> 07:58.972
Just everybody watch where
they point those things.

08:00.673 --> 08:01.942
- Come on.

08:02.077 --> 08:05.748
Hey, somebody
let me out of here!

08:09.015 --> 08:11.319
- Please, please stop, please.

08:11.455 --> 08:13.954
- Hey man, knock it off!

08:18.131 --> 08:19.861
- Just calm down.

08:26.335 --> 08:27.638
- Hey!

08:28.973 --> 08:30.908
Man, knock it off! Why
don't you come over here?

08:55.397 --> 08:56.634
- I see.

08:57.501 --> 08:59.904
You found the tools.

09:00.039 --> 09:01.067
Good.

09:02.308 --> 09:04.242
But tools are nothing

09:04.377 --> 09:06.703
until you learn how to use them.

09:06.838 --> 09:07.671
- Where are we?

09:07.806 --> 09:09.008
Why are we here?

09:09.143 --> 09:11.143
To find out who we
really are, Sean.

09:12.045 --> 09:13.613
Wait, how do you know my name?

09:13.749 --> 09:15.818
- I know a lot about you.

09:15.953 --> 09:19.822
And I want to know
more about all of you.

09:20.825 --> 09:23.828
- Oh god, this is
too fucking crazy.

09:23.964 --> 09:26.891
I gotta get out of here,
gotta get fucking out of here.

09:27.026 --> 09:29.695
Somebody let me out of here!

09:29.831 --> 09:32.296
- Richard, pay attention.

09:32.431 --> 09:35.337
I am going to tell you
how you can get out.

09:35.473 --> 09:38.341
Okay, I'm listening.

09:38.476 --> 09:41.575
My name is Dr. Kasuma,

09:41.711 --> 09:44.276
and this is my experiment.

09:45.479 --> 09:48.918
On this screen, you will
see a person who is trapped.

09:49.054 --> 09:52.020
You can free that person
very easily and yourself.

09:53.156 --> 09:57.123
All you have to do is
kill someone in this room.

09:58.791 --> 10:00.260
- That's crazy.

10:00.395 --> 10:04.361
- Tracey, what is your maternal
instinct telling you to do?

10:04.496 --> 10:06.803
My instinct is telling
me that you're sick

10:06.938 --> 10:09.139
and I don't want to
play your little game.

10:09.274 --> 10:10.103
That's fine.

10:11.978 --> 10:16.615
But I guarantee someone
else will play eventually.

10:20.614 --> 10:24.384
None of us are gonna decide
to kill someone in this room.

10:24.519 --> 10:25.723
- No?

10:26.425 --> 10:28.154
You are all strangers.

10:28.289 --> 10:32.461
But this woman, she
is someone one of you

10:32.597 --> 10:35.964
will miss very, very much.

10:38.864 --> 10:40.397
- Sarah, Sarah.

10:41.775 --> 10:44.843
She is safe for now,
but not for long.

10:44.978 --> 10:47.344
Are you willing to do what
it takes to free your wife

10:47.479 --> 10:49.109
and yourself, Richard?

10:50.915 --> 10:53.677
Olivia, you have
tools in your hand.

10:53.812 --> 10:58.019
You can free yourself and you
can leave anytime you want.

10:58.154 --> 11:01.519
Please, I don't want to
be here anymore, please!

11:01.654 --> 11:06.061
- No, no, no, no, Olivia,
begging does you no good.

11:07.064 --> 11:10.326
First person to kill
someone here leaves.

11:10.462 --> 11:13.535
By killing first, you'll
save your own life

11:13.671 --> 11:15.432
and that of someone else.

11:17.070 --> 11:19.139
You can walk right out the door

11:20.505 --> 11:22.507
but you have to
earn that privilege.

11:23.510 --> 11:28.148
Alice, I see you found
a very powerful tool.

11:30.688 --> 11:32.955
I hope you use it wisely.

11:38.864 --> 11:40.691
You have until the
timer goes off to

11:40.826 --> 11:46.166
decide if this woman lives or
dies, save her and yourself.

11:51.140 --> 11:53.036
- Sarah, talk to
me, where are you?

11:53.171 --> 11:55.038
Can you hear my voice?

11:55.174 --> 11:57.476
Kill someone and we live.

11:57.612 --> 11:58.881
Why?

11:59.016 --> 12:01.385
I mean, how can we
even believe her?

12:01.521 --> 12:02.850
- You will believe me, L,

12:02.985 --> 12:05.350
because you have
no other choice.

12:06.019 --> 12:08.451
When the timer runs out

12:08.587 --> 12:11.862
the lights will go out
and one of you must die.

12:28.580 --> 12:29.777
- Just calm down, man.

12:29.912 --> 12:31.144
You're not making any sense.

12:31.280 --> 12:33.377
Just relax and calm down
while we try to think.

12:33.512 --> 12:35.584
- You just want me
to fucking relax?

12:35.719 --> 12:36.986
You want me to relax?

12:37.121 --> 12:38.752
They have my wife's
somewhere in a cell,

12:38.888 --> 12:40.924
and you want me to relax?

12:45.496 --> 12:47.128
- Oh God, Sarah.

12:52.264 --> 12:53.864
Your wife is okay, Richard.

12:53.999 --> 12:55.433
My wife is okay.

12:56.342 --> 12:57.237
Oh, is she?

12:58.476 --> 12:59.408
She's okay?

12:59.543 --> 13:00.740
All good.

13:00.875 --> 13:01.641
Good, that's good.

13:01.776 --> 13:02.776
That's good.

13:02.911 --> 13:03.907
You think she's okay?

13:04.042 --> 13:05.080
Fuck you!

13:14.091 --> 13:15.954
- Do you recognize that
woman in the screen?

13:16.090 --> 13:17.022
I've never seen that woman.

13:17.157 --> 13:18.496
- I think she's trying to say is

13:18.631 --> 13:21.024
are you in on this whole thing?

13:21.159 --> 13:22.393
What do you know?

13:22.529 --> 13:24.132
Are you part of that
lady's experiment?

13:25.770 --> 13:27.036
I've never seen that woman.

13:27.171 --> 13:29.468
- Look, you two look
an awful lot alike.

13:29.604 --> 13:32.876
Am I suppose to think that's
a fucking coincidence?

13:33.012 --> 13:34.775
- It's not that much
of a coincidence.

13:34.911 --> 13:36.210
there is a whole fucking,

13:36.345 --> 13:37.949
- That's too much of
a coincidence for me!

13:38.084 --> 13:40.011
- Look, Olivia is in here
with all of us, okay?

13:40.147 --> 13:42.084
How could she be in on it?

13:42.220 --> 13:44.349
Something's not right
about her being here.

13:44.484 --> 13:47.355
- Nothing is right
about any of this.

13:47.490 --> 13:51.028
We have to try to get out of
here any way that we can, okay?

13:51.164 --> 13:53.696
Let's try prying the door
open with your hatchet.

13:53.831 --> 13:55.867
- Richard, we could use your ax.

13:56.768 --> 13:58.536
Richard, please, come on.

13:58.672 --> 14:00.333
- Stay the fuck away from me.

14:17.420 --> 14:20.085
You should cover your
ears in there little one.

14:20.221 --> 14:21.893
I'm gonna get you out of here.

14:25.357 --> 14:27.228
- Can you hear me, anything?

14:35.537 --> 14:37.068
- Gimme that gun, we
gotta shoot the lock off!

14:37.204 --> 14:38.738
No way, this gun is mine.

14:38.874 --> 14:40.405
Get your own.

14:40.540 --> 14:44.146
- I'm not playing, give
me that fucking gun.

14:45.176 --> 14:46.650
- Fuck you.

14:46.785 --> 14:49.186
What part of gun beats knife

14:49.322 --> 14:52.387
and every other weapon in this
room don't you understand?

14:52.522 --> 14:54.221
- Come on, you don't have
to take the gun from her.

14:54.356 --> 14:56.888
She can shoot the
lock off herself.

14:57.024 --> 14:58.121
Alice, right?

14:58.256 --> 15:00.461
Look, I'm unarmed.

15:00.597 --> 15:04.761
If we can get this door open,
we can all get out alive.

15:04.896 --> 15:08.371
Why do you keep acting
like you know everything?

15:09.441 --> 15:13.141
We have no idea what's on
the other side of that door.

15:13.277 --> 15:15.407
The only thing I know
for certain right now is

15:15.543 --> 15:20.380
if I keep this gun,
I'm going to live.

15:22.886 --> 15:24.988
I'm tired of your shit.

15:25.124 --> 15:28.293
Do not make me take
that gun from you.

15:28.428 --> 15:29.454
Go ahead.

15:29.589 --> 15:31.963
You'll take a bullet
to the face too.

15:44.305 --> 15:45.136
We don't have much time left.

15:45.271 --> 15:46.136
What are you gonna do?

15:46.272 --> 15:47.979
What is he going to do?

15:50.750 --> 15:52.042
I'm not gonna do anything.

15:52.177 --> 15:53.584
I'm not..

15:53.720 --> 15:55.415
I'm not gonna kill anybody.

15:57.717 --> 16:00.420
I bet you'd think different
if you had the gun.

16:00.556 --> 16:04.191
Gun, ax, hatchet, I'm
not a fucking killer.

16:04.327 --> 16:06.257
None of us deserve
to die right now

16:06.392 --> 16:08.731
this is all just ridiculous.

16:08.866 --> 16:11.435
Even to save her life?

16:11.571 --> 16:12.696
Fucking pussy.

16:14.701 --> 16:17.437
You
don't fucking know me.

16:20.579 --> 16:22.079
Stay back!

16:24.409 --> 16:25.683
- You don't know me.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.045
None of you fucking know me.

16:27.181 --> 16:29.278
None of you know me!

16:42.532 --> 16:45.730
So you'd rather kill any
of us? Murder is that easy?

16:45.865 --> 16:48.667
Hey, this is all still
just hypothetical, right?

16:48.803 --> 16:51.141
- Till the timer runs out
and the lights go out...

16:53.640 --> 16:56.245
- This all could
be a game, right?

16:56.381 --> 16:59.277
I mean, she keeps calling
this an experiment

16:59.412 --> 17:02.285
like it's a psychological test.

17:02.420 --> 17:04.722
I mean, there's no way that
she expects any one of us

17:04.858 --> 17:05.951
to kill somebody in this room.

17:06.087 --> 17:07.321
This is real.

17:07.457 --> 17:09.621
There's nothing
hypothetical about it.

17:17.297 --> 17:18.530
- Hey, are you okay?

17:18.666 --> 17:21.798
- Yeah, please just
stay away from me.

17:34.352 --> 17:35.581
- What do you expect
me to do then, huh?

17:36.350 --> 17:37.713
What do you want me to do?

17:37.849 --> 17:40.450
Hack one of these
people to death

17:40.586 --> 17:42.660
In order for my wife to live?

17:42.795 --> 17:44.387
Is that what you want?

17:44.523 --> 17:45.789
What do you want from me?

17:46.898 --> 17:48.192
Let me talk to my wife.

17:48.328 --> 17:49.963
Let me talk to my wife.

17:50.099 --> 17:52.202
Let me talk to my wife!

17:57.169 --> 17:58.372
Richard?

17:58.507 --> 18:02.608
Sarah, Sarah, Sarah,
can you hear me?

18:09.547 --> 18:10.587
Who's there with you?

18:10.723 --> 18:11.551
Are you alone?

18:12.825 --> 18:13.722
Are they feeding you?

18:15.728 --> 18:17.392
Where are you?

18:21.766 --> 18:24.299
I'm real close.

18:24.435 --> 18:29.305
I know things haven't
been good in a long time

18:29.440 --> 18:33.408
and I'm sorry, I know
I pushed you away,

18:33.543 --> 18:37.579
and I just, if you
can get me out of here

18:38.616 --> 18:42.718
I'll be so much better,
I'm sorry for everything.

18:42.854 --> 18:44.583
I'm so sorry.

18:44.719 --> 18:48.023
- Just don't worry,
okay, just relax.

18:48.158 --> 18:49.123
We're gonna get you out of there

18:49.259 --> 18:51.289
and then we're gonna go home.

18:51.424 --> 18:53.597
- Okay, I can't wait.

18:55.297 --> 18:59.203
Oh God, Richard, I love you.

19:10.113 --> 19:11.211
Let me talk to my wife.

19:11.346 --> 19:13.217
Let me fucking talk to my wife!

19:14.183 --> 19:15.648
Let me talk to my wife!

19:17.556 --> 19:20.257
If my wife dies, I'm not a
killer, I didn't do this,

19:20.392 --> 19:22.887
I'm not, this isn't
me, I didn't kill her.

19:23.023 --> 19:25.625
It's that fucked up woman
on TV, she's the killer.

19:25.760 --> 19:27.423
She's the one that's
doing this, not me.

19:27.558 --> 19:29.965
I didn't do this.

19:30.100 --> 19:31.428
Somebody do something.

19:31.564 --> 19:33.765
Stop the fucking ticking!

19:36.506 --> 19:39.176
Somebody let me out
of here, please!

19:39.311 --> 19:42.611
Somebody please
help me out of here!

19:42.746 --> 19:43.841
No!

20:40.534 --> 20:41.232
- Was that you screaming?

20:41.367 --> 20:42.940
Are you alright?

20:43.076 --> 20:45.868
Yeah, I didn't mean to scream.

20:46.004 --> 20:48.572
I thought he was
coming toward me.

20:48.707 --> 20:52.377
- I didn't do it, are you happy?

20:52.513 --> 20:53.977
Did you get your results?

20:55.053 --> 20:56.881
Good, write them down.

20:58.485 --> 21:00.485
Your experiment worked.

21:00.620 --> 21:03.490
I'm not a killer, you got that?

21:03.626 --> 21:05.857
Now open the door
and let us out.

21:07.693 --> 21:10.662
Richard, you love your wife.

21:10.798 --> 21:13.470
And she obviously loves
you very much too.

21:14.673 --> 21:17.505
But you didn't love her
enough to save her, did you?

21:17.641 --> 21:20.338
You know the
consequences of inaction.

21:20.474 --> 21:22.742
But seeing is believing.

21:24.383 --> 21:28.653
Richard, Richard,
please help me.

21:30.554 --> 21:33.482
No, no, no, Sarah,
Sarah, Sarah, no.

21:33.618 --> 21:34.754
What is that?

21:36.161 --> 21:37.456
- Richard, please help me!

21:37.591 --> 21:39.158
Richard, where are you, help me!

21:43.630 --> 21:48.233
Richard, I can't breathe.

21:48.369 --> 21:49.903
Sarah, focus.

21:50.039 --> 21:51.638
Sarah, focus, there's gotta
be a way out of there, okay?

21:51.773 --> 21:53.269
There's gotta be a
way out of there,

21:53.405 --> 21:55.539
just look around, look around,
pound the walls, scream.

21:55.675 --> 21:58.078
Is there a window, a door?

21:58.213 --> 21:59.280
Look over there.

21:59.416 --> 22:01.352
Look, look, look, behind you.

22:02.649 --> 22:05.356
- Hello, Richard, help me.

22:10.789 --> 22:12.990
Oh God, Sarah, I'm sorry.

22:14.594 --> 22:16.195
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

23:15.259 --> 23:16.526
I'm sorry, Richard,

23:16.661 --> 23:19.763
but I don't like the
results of this experiment.

23:19.898 --> 23:23.830
But tell me, why didn't you
do anything to save your wife?

23:27.602 --> 23:31.805
I didn't do it, I didn't do it.

23:34.110 --> 23:38.547
- They say you don't know
what you have until it's gone.

23:38.683 --> 23:40.281
Do you know what you
had now, Richard?

23:40.416 --> 23:42.218
- Okay, that's enough.

23:42.354 --> 23:43.950
Richard, your wife isn't dead.

23:44.085 --> 23:46.787
This is just another
part of their experiment.

23:46.922 --> 23:49.125
And they just gassed her
the same way they did us

23:49.261 --> 23:50.554
when they brought us here

23:50.689 --> 23:52.792
Your wife is fine.

23:52.927 --> 23:56.832
- No Sean, his wife
is indeed dead.

23:56.968 --> 24:00.670
I can provide more graphic
proof if you don't believe me.

24:00.806 --> 24:03.132
- That's enough, stop torturing
us and let us out of here.

24:03.268 --> 24:06.170
- This isn't torture,
this is a test.

24:06.305 --> 24:09.177
Would you like me to show
you the difference, L?

24:09.313 --> 24:10.278
- This isn't a test.

24:10.414 --> 24:12.680
This is sadism, you freak.

24:12.816 --> 24:16.585
Please, please, just
let us go, please.

24:16.720 --> 24:19.719
There's one way out
of here for you.

24:19.855 --> 24:22.889
Follow the rules
of the experiment.

24:35.802 --> 24:38.204
- Crazy bitch has my sister!

24:38.339 --> 24:41.738
- Whoa, whoa, calm down, watch
where you point that thing.

24:41.874 --> 24:44.680
Why, I might kill someone?

24:46.784 --> 24:48.884
Have you fuckers been
paying attention?

24:49.019 --> 24:53.824
They're going to kill my sister
if I don't kill one of you.

24:53.959 --> 24:58.861
The only question now is which
one of you deserves to die?

24:58.997 --> 25:00.058
You?

25:00.193 --> 25:01.864
Don't you point that
fucking thing at me.

25:02.000 --> 25:02.962
You?

25:04.266 --> 25:05.096
You?

25:08.534 --> 25:09.969
Or him?

25:12.806 --> 25:14.203
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

25:14.339 --> 25:17.046
We don't know if anybody
is actually dead yet.

25:17.181 --> 25:17.873
- You're right.

25:18.009 --> 25:19.782
That's actually possible.

25:19.918 --> 25:23.351
The gas, maybe they just knocked
her out for a little while

25:23.487 --> 25:25.083
the same way they did us.

25:26.091 --> 25:28.988
No, she's gone.

25:30.689 --> 25:31.859
She's gone.

25:33.197 --> 25:36.066
I saw her face.

25:36.201 --> 25:39.531
Oh, it's my fault.

25:39.667 --> 25:41.737
No, it's not your fault.

25:42.605 --> 25:44.674
She knew that you loved her

25:45.876 --> 25:47.770
and you were there
for her when she died.

25:47.906 --> 25:49.239
What does it matter?

25:50.041 --> 25:52.182
We're not growing old together.

25:52.318 --> 25:53.815
We're not having a family.

25:55.782 --> 25:59.581
She's dead. Period.

25:59.717 --> 26:01.552
The end.

26:01.687 --> 26:03.022
That's it.

26:07.464 --> 26:09.793
You stay away from me.

26:09.929 --> 26:12.196
Just leave me alone, okay?

26:14.532 --> 26:17.634
- Just put it away, there
has to be another solution.

26:17.770 --> 26:19.270
- Look at him.

26:19.406 --> 26:22.878
Ask him and his wife if
there's another solution.

26:23.013 --> 26:25.376
- Alice, put the gun
down, you're not a killer.

26:25.512 --> 26:26.512
I'm not.

26:26.648 --> 26:27.948
No! You're not a killer!

26:28.083 --> 26:30.851
Fuck you, you don't
know anything about me

26:30.986 --> 26:34.283
and I don't know
anything about you.

26:34.418 --> 26:36.622
Why would I choose
any of your lives

26:36.758 --> 26:39.263
over the life of my sister?

26:39.398 --> 26:41.193
Just hold on a second, okay?

26:41.329 --> 26:43.833
Look, you've got a gun and
there's still time left.

26:43.969 --> 26:46.201
Let's just take a second
and talk things out, okay?

26:46.337 --> 26:48.071
- Fine, talk!

26:48.206 --> 26:50.135
Just stay back.

26:53.938 --> 26:55.810
Okay, so what?

26:55.946 --> 26:59.608
- What, I'm supposed to
have all the answers?

26:59.744 --> 27:03.114
I just want us to talk before
things get out of control.

27:03.249 --> 27:06.488
- Things are already
out of control.

27:06.623 --> 27:10.054
Alright, so what do we know?

27:10.190 --> 27:12.761
That lady can see
us and hear us.

27:12.897 --> 27:17.063
So any escape attempt
that we might try to do.

27:18.936 --> 27:21.502
- Look, there's no
way they could get us

27:21.638 --> 27:23.037
in this room by themself.

27:23.172 --> 27:26.270
There's gotta be more
people outside that door.

27:33.110 --> 27:35.653
I can't hear anything.

27:38.117 --> 27:40.823
I can't hear anyone out here.

27:47.859 --> 27:49.128
She knows.

27:50.596 --> 27:52.000
Me?

27:52.135 --> 27:56.135
Tell us, how many of your
friends are out there?

27:57.409 --> 27:58.676
- I already told you,

27:58.811 --> 28:00.410
I was forced into
this room same as you,

28:00.545 --> 28:01.873
I have nothing to do with this.

28:02.008 --> 28:03.206
- Maybe you do, maybe you don't,

28:03.342 --> 28:06.145
I know the fastest
way to find out.

28:07.077 --> 28:08.478
Stop it, alright,

28:08.613 --> 28:11.780
we have to work together if
we want to get out of here.

28:11.916 --> 28:17.123
- Wait, wait, if they had his
wife and they have your sister

28:18.226 --> 28:19.660
it makes sense that
they have someone

28:19.795 --> 28:21.226
that each of us cares about.

28:22.400 --> 28:24.027
- Tracey's right.

28:24.162 --> 28:26.396
They got us and our loved ones.

28:28.874 --> 28:34.042
So, so where, where are
they keeping them, huh?

28:34.344 --> 28:35.371
Here?

28:35.507 --> 28:37.412
In the same building
or somewhere else?

28:37.548 --> 28:39.650
Just no way of knowing.

28:39.785 --> 28:41.648
- We don't even know
where we are right now.

28:41.783 --> 28:43.316
What does it all mean?

28:43.452 --> 28:45.420
I mean, what does that doctor
lady, what does she want?

28:45.556 --> 28:46.856
You know what she wants,

28:46.991 --> 28:48.788
she wants me to kill
someone in this room!

28:48.923 --> 28:50.957
- And if this is an experiment,

28:51.093 --> 28:53.863
there has to be
a way to beat it.

28:53.998 --> 28:56.499
- They tell us that they
want us to kill someone

28:56.635 --> 28:57.931
but that can't be the answer.

28:58.067 --> 28:59.865
They must be looking
for something.

29:00.001 --> 29:01.430
What are they trying to find?

29:01.566 --> 29:03.201
- They want to see
us act like animals!

29:03.337 --> 29:07.778
They're using people we
love to manipulate us.

29:10.916 --> 29:15.043
If I kill one person, I
get out of here alive.

29:15.179 --> 29:16.985
My sister gets out too,

29:17.121 --> 29:19.184
now that sounds like a
way better deal to me

29:19.320 --> 29:22.490
than dying in here with
a bunch of strangers.

29:22.626 --> 29:25.054
Hey, just wait a minute.

29:25.189 --> 29:27.093
This isn't about love.

29:27.229 --> 29:30.631
That doctor lady, she's
playing us like rats.

29:30.767 --> 29:33.099
She wants to see us fight.

29:33.235 --> 29:38.307
Yeah, and I'm about
to end this game.

29:48.148 --> 29:50.083
Should have killed one of you,

29:50.218 --> 29:52.284
I could've been
with her right now.

29:53.218 --> 29:54.989
You couldn't kill for your wife.

29:55.125 --> 29:58.726
That doesn't mean
you're a bad person.

29:58.862 --> 30:01.129
- No, it just means I'm weak.

30:01.264 --> 30:06.463
Come on, go ahead, go
ahead, shoot me, come on.

30:14.010 --> 30:18.747
Stay back.
- Go on, shoot me.

30:18.883 --> 30:22.881
Come on, come on, do it.
- Stay back.

30:23.017 --> 30:25.850
Shoot me, I'm volunteering.

30:25.985 --> 30:27.858
Save your sister.

30:33.093 --> 30:36.060
Save your sister, save yourself.

30:36.196 --> 30:37.933
Get out of here and end this.

30:38.068 --> 30:40.233
- Richard, you don't
mean that, don't do it.

30:46.777 --> 30:49.143
You don't have to do this.

30:53.547 --> 30:56.213
Do you want to see her
dead in front of you?

30:56.348 --> 30:59.314
Just do it.
- Don't do it.

30:59.450 --> 31:01.553
- Do it.
- Don't do it.

31:01.689 --> 31:03.291
- Hurry!

31:03.427 --> 31:04.527
- Do it.

31:04.663 --> 31:07.062
Let him go, Alice. -Stop!

31:08.329 --> 31:10.661
Just do it, shoot,
shoot, come on.

31:10.797 --> 31:12.762
Do it, come on, do it, I'm
volunteering, just shoot me.

31:12.898 --> 31:18.271
Do it, come on, do it, I'm
volunteering, just shoot me.

31:24.646 --> 31:25.476
Natalie?

31:36.324 --> 31:39.358
Come on, pull the
fucking trigger.

31:48.298 --> 31:50.105
Do it, do it now.

31:51.170 --> 31:52.103
Come on, you can do it.

31:52.238 --> 31:54.637
Pull the motherfucking trigger.

32:27.339 --> 32:29.740
Are you fucking kidding me?!

32:48.193 --> 32:50.232
- Look at you now.

32:50.367 --> 32:53.234
You don't have shit,
just like the rest of us.

32:54.606 --> 32:55.566
You're stuck here.

32:57.501 --> 32:59.438
And your sister's gonna die.

33:13.558 --> 33:15.421
Fucking die!

33:34.472 --> 33:39.643
- No, no, help me, help me!

33:42.417 --> 33:45.081
I don't wanna die,
please help me!

33:45.216 --> 33:46.749
Please help me.

33:55.667 --> 33:56.792
- You stabbed her!

33:56.928 --> 34:00.433
No, no, I just took the
machete, I needed a weapon!

34:01.365 --> 34:02.699
You did this.

34:04.007 --> 34:05.939
- I didn't do it, he did it.

34:06.074 --> 34:07.677
- I didn't touch her!

34:07.813 --> 34:10.345
Then why are you bleeding?

34:10.481 --> 34:11.811
- You tell me, I wasn't
the one that touched her.

34:18.516 --> 34:21.090
- Come on guys, help her!

34:21.225 --> 34:23.759
Alice, please, you
have to save her.

34:23.895 --> 34:25.524
You have to save my baby.

34:26.257 --> 34:28.031
Please help me.

34:28.167 --> 34:30.529
- Alice, you better
fucking help her.

34:32.496 --> 34:34.267
Please, anybody help me.

34:34.403 --> 34:37.806
- We can't, it's either
her or my sister,

34:37.942 --> 34:40.236
I can't, she's gotta die.

34:40.371 --> 34:41.903
Get away from her!

34:42.873 --> 34:45.881
Alice, I know
you're a good person

34:46.016 --> 34:47.348
and I don't blame you for this.

34:47.484 --> 34:50.179
I don't blame you, but your
sister's gonna be fine.

34:50.314 --> 34:51.380
But my baby.

34:51.516 --> 34:54.053
Tracey, your baby is dead!

34:54.188 --> 34:56.659
- No, no, no, not yet.

34:56.794 --> 34:58.892
No, just help me.

34:59.028 --> 35:01.727
Please just help me!

35:02.897 --> 35:06.296
- Please, she needs a doctor,
she's fucking pregnant!

35:06.432 --> 35:08.666
Come on, have some decency!

35:09.402 --> 35:14.270
Alice, I trust you, I trust you.

35:14.406 --> 35:17.173
I need you to save her.

35:22.885 --> 35:24.381
What's her name?

35:24.516 --> 35:26.548
- I don't know, we were waiting

35:26.683 --> 35:29.491
until she was born to name her.

35:29.627 --> 35:31.194
But, um

35:32.159 --> 35:33.460
um maybe Rose.

35:45.336 --> 35:46.538
Help her.

35:46.673 --> 35:51.313
Alice, Alice, you
can't let her die.

35:54.483 --> 35:57.253
You can do anything
what you want.

35:59.954 --> 36:01.554
Wait

36:03.258 --> 36:06.229
- Okay, okay, what can I do?

36:08.025 --> 36:11.632
- You need the smallest,
sharpest weapon in here.

36:12.736 --> 36:16.873
- Where's the knife, where's
the knife, give it to me.

36:17.008 --> 36:19.000
Shit, you just had it.

36:19.136 --> 36:23.109
- Then do it for her!
- Give her your knife.

36:23.245 --> 36:25.644
Just give it to her, man.

36:28.482 --> 36:31.188
- Give her your fucking knife!

36:39.456 --> 36:40.659
Now what?

36:43.668 --> 36:46.633
- Okay, okay, you're going to
have to listen to me because

36:46.769 --> 36:50.339
once you start, I'm not
going be able to help you.

36:50.474 --> 36:54.910
You're going to have
to cut horizontally

36:55.046 --> 36:57.411
across my pelvis and then

36:57.546 --> 36:59.612
you're gonna to have
to pull her out.

37:01.152 --> 37:03.946
How will I know where to cut?

37:05.419 --> 37:09.721
- I have a scar from my son.

37:12.693 --> 37:15.562
I'm gonna do it, okay?
- Okay, okay.

37:28.839 --> 37:30.309
- I'll take care of her, okay?

37:30.444 --> 37:31.881
I'm gonna make sure she's okay!

37:32.017 --> 37:33.776
No one's gonna touch her.

37:33.912 --> 37:35.549
- Okay, I trust
you, I trust you.

37:35.684 --> 37:38.717
- I'm gonna reach in to
get the baby out, okay?

37:42.354 --> 37:43.722
Is she okay?

37:44.588 --> 37:45.856
- She's fine.

37:48.593 --> 37:51.730
Hold your baby girl.

38:26.603 --> 38:30.137
So we fix our eyes
not on what is seen,

38:30.272 --> 38:33.339
but on what is unseen,

38:33.475 --> 38:36.738
for what is seen is temporary,

38:36.874 --> 38:40.647
but what is unseen is eternal

38:59.537 --> 39:01.602
That was a
nice effort, Alice.

39:01.737 --> 39:04.632
Too bad, you couldn't
save Tracey's baby

39:04.768 --> 39:07.038
or your poor sister.

39:07.174 --> 39:08.004
- What?

39:09.241 --> 39:12.811
The kill needs to happen
before the lights come on.

39:13.913 --> 39:15.511
I didn't do this,
but she's dead.

39:15.646 --> 39:17.052
That's not right.

39:17.188 --> 39:20.422
This is all an experiment.

39:20.558 --> 39:22.755
There's no right or
wrong here, Alice.

39:22.890 --> 39:25.895
I only want to learn
from the best result.

39:26.031 --> 39:27.622
Alice, can you hear me?

39:27.758 --> 39:29.663
Please, I'm scared.

39:34.231 --> 39:39.607
Alice, come and get
me out of here, Alice.

39:41.306 --> 39:43.972
You're still gonna kill
her sister after all this?

39:44.108 --> 39:46.544
By failing to
follow instructions,

39:46.680 --> 39:48.814
all of you killed her sister.

39:49.713 --> 39:50.849
You're a monster.

39:53.789 --> 39:57.123
You are the monster,
Sean. Don't you see?

39:57.258 --> 39:58.426
You all are.

39:58.562 --> 40:01.727
My experiment is
only proving that.

40:01.862 --> 40:03.698
And the result from
this experiment

40:03.833 --> 40:06.733
will change the way we
all think about humanity,

40:06.868 --> 40:12.068
morality, life, love
and of course, death.

40:13.038 --> 40:16.479
You can't turn me
into a murderer.

40:18.777 --> 40:22.217
She's dead, please, she's gone.

40:22.352 --> 40:23.745
Please just spare my sister.

40:23.881 --> 40:26.483
You gave me fucking blanks.

40:26.619 --> 40:28.388
I'm trying to kill!

40:33.960 --> 40:37.027
Your excuses are
unacceptable, Alice.

40:38.533 --> 40:42.839
Natalie, can you hear me?

40:48.772 --> 40:49.672
I can't help you.

40:49.808 --> 40:52.013
I can't help either of us.

40:52.149 --> 40:53.516
I'm so sorry.

40:54.619 --> 40:57.487
You know me, I can't
do anything right.

40:59.822 --> 41:03.525
- It's okay, Allie,
I know you're good.

41:03.661 --> 41:05.926
I know you've been
looking out for me.

41:06.929 --> 41:09.026
You've always been so
much stronger than me.

41:13.832 --> 41:16.935
- I'm not strong, I was selfish.

41:17.770 --> 41:20.202
I've always been selfish.

41:21.646 --> 41:23.743
I'm sorry I wasn't a
better sister to you.

41:23.879 --> 41:28.177
I'm sorry I stole
everything from you.

41:30.050 --> 41:33.787
I stole your boyfriends,
your money, everything.

41:35.820 --> 41:37.593
I tried to save you.

41:39.262 --> 41:40.189
I really did.

41:44.795 --> 41:46.195
- I'm just tired.

41:47.701 --> 41:49.968
I'm just gonna go to sleep.

41:51.309 --> 41:53.241
No, Natalie, don't go to sleep.

41:53.377 --> 41:56.139
Natalie, can you hear me?

42:08.620 --> 42:10.120
You evil bitch!

42:10.255 --> 42:13.189
You're going to kill
all of us, aren't you?

42:16.801 --> 42:19.998
I'm not the one making
the choices here, you are.

42:32.878 --> 42:34.410
- Do you think it stopped?

42:34.546 --> 42:37.246
Do you think that
means that she's seen enough?

42:38.623 --> 42:40.788
A person like that
never sees enough.

42:41.957 --> 42:44.594
- Maybe she wants to
see what happens next.

42:45.496 --> 42:48.796
How we deal with this trauma.

42:52.101 --> 42:54.831
- There's no way we're all
getting out of here alive.

42:54.966 --> 42:57.036
- This is an experiment, right?

42:58.006 --> 42:59.937
Maybe she got the
results she wanted.

43:00.073 --> 43:04.242
I mean, they saw
Richard not do anything.

43:04.378 --> 43:08.211
They made Alice attempt to
kill and Tracey getting hurt.

43:09.320 --> 43:10.851
It was just an accident.

43:15.525 --> 43:18.254
She knows I didn't do anything.

43:19.356 --> 43:21.895
She just wanted to
see my wife die.

43:25.901 --> 43:29.166
She would do
anything for anybody.

43:29.301 --> 43:32.939
I can still see her face
just coming towards me.

43:33.074 --> 43:36.074
It's just happening over
and over and over again.

43:37.782 --> 43:39.914
It's like I'm fucking
living in hell.

43:40.049 --> 43:43.784
I was ready to shoot that
poor man in the face.

43:43.920 --> 43:47.624
- Come on, let us out,
haven't you seen enough!

43:47.759 --> 43:50.858
- The doors aren't opening,
nothing's happening.

43:52.628 --> 43:55.595
- That door isn't going to open.

43:55.731 --> 43:57.728
Then what's this waiting for?

43:57.863 --> 43:59.196
- The bitch is crazy.

43:59.332 --> 44:01.896
Maybe she just wants to
see us all kill each other.

44:02.032 --> 44:03.805
- Look the TV's off.

44:04.771 --> 44:05.972
There's no ticking.

44:07.743 --> 44:09.173
Maybe she's thinking it over.

44:11.443 --> 44:13.274
- You think she's
planning on letting us go?

44:13.410 --> 44:15.377
We should come up
with a plan too.

44:16.447 --> 44:18.616
Hey, stay back we're
not out of anything!

44:18.752 --> 44:20.690
Okay, okay, no problem.

44:23.691 --> 44:27.125
Please, open the door!

44:27.992 --> 44:31.360
- The door, open it?

44:32.969 --> 44:35.002
You think they're
gonna open that door?

44:35.938 --> 44:37.465
They're never gonna
open that door.

44:38.402 --> 44:40.739
They are never
opening that door,

44:40.874 --> 44:42.811
we're all gonna die in here.

44:42.946 --> 44:45.979
We're all gonna die
and rot in this room.

44:53.016 --> 44:54.854
Open the door!

44:54.990 --> 44:58.156
I don't wanna die
in here, please!

44:58.892 --> 45:00.956
I just wanna go back home alive.

45:01.092 --> 45:02.662
We just wanna go back home.

45:02.797 --> 45:04.529
We don't care what you want.

45:04.665 --> 45:05.930
We don't care!

45:06.065 --> 45:08.203
Please let us go
back home alive!

45:08.338 --> 45:09.666
- Come on!

45:09.801 --> 45:10.905
Let us out!

45:17.043 --> 45:18.407
The experiment isn't over yet.

45:18.543 --> 45:22.180
It is absolutely essential
that you continue.

45:30.988 --> 45:31.688
- Who is that?

45:31.824 --> 45:32.894
Who knows her?

45:33.990 --> 45:35.627
I know her.

45:35.763 --> 45:38.064
She's my girlfriend.

45:39.536 --> 45:41.265
Ana, can you hear me?

45:42.635 --> 45:43.465
Ana?

45:45.909 --> 45:51.111
Ana, Ana, hey, hey,
can you hear me?

45:52.047 --> 45:54.509
Look, look, I'm
here, I'm here, Ana.

45:55.751 --> 45:58.282
- Hurry, help, I love you.

46:02.090 --> 46:05.626
I don't know how
I got here, baby.

46:05.762 --> 46:07.324
I don't know what's happening.

46:08.461 --> 46:11.693
Baby, just be patient,
okay, just be patient.

46:11.828 --> 46:16.205
I will get you out, okay, I
promise, I promise to you, okay?

46:16.341 --> 46:17.499
- I love you.

46:21.312 --> 46:22.504
I love you too.

47:53.763 --> 47:56.268
I don't want to have
to kill you, Richard.

47:58.236 --> 47:59.601
But I'm going to have to.

48:00.744 --> 48:02.978
- I know, I know, I know.

48:05.175 --> 48:06.344
I understand.

48:07.310 --> 48:09.380
I'm done, done playing.

48:11.048 --> 48:12.053
Just do it.

48:13.222 --> 48:15.518
- I think you have to
make it easy for me.

48:21.196 --> 48:24.164
I think you should
kill yourself.

48:27.463 --> 48:28.936
You allowed your wife to die

48:29.072 --> 48:31.204
because you couldn't
kill for her.

48:33.071 --> 48:34.108
Now it's time.

48:40.651 --> 48:41.918
This is really sharp.

48:46.452 --> 48:49.992
You can slit your wrist
with it very easily.

48:55.631 --> 48:57.164
Let me show you.

49:00.830 --> 49:05.341
Slice your wrist down
your arm like this.

49:05.476 --> 49:06.404
Not across.

49:08.078 --> 49:09.979
You will bleed out
really quickly.

49:12.650 --> 49:13.642
It will barely hurt.

49:19.684 --> 49:21.456
- Seriously, you're
gonna let this happen?

49:21.591 --> 49:22.953
- Shut up!

49:23.089 --> 49:24.553
I can't watch this.

49:24.688 --> 49:28.096
- This is my fucking
business, okay?

49:30.298 --> 49:34.097
- Richard, you don't
have to do this.

49:34.233 --> 49:37.005
- Hey, it's his call, man.

49:37.140 --> 49:38.902
- Make her do it,
she should do it.

49:39.037 --> 49:40.207
- Shut up!

49:42.678 --> 49:43.738
- I can do this.

49:47.280 --> 49:49.447
I can do this, let me do this.

49:53.251 --> 49:54.249
She should be here.

49:54.384 --> 49:55.651
She shouldn't be dead.

49:59.897 --> 50:03.291
- She shouldn't be dead.
- No.

50:03.427 --> 50:07.729
- But she is now, join her.

50:08.704 --> 50:10.234
Yes.
- Yeah.

50:10.370 --> 50:12.772
- You can kiss her.
- Yeah.

50:12.907 --> 50:14.472
- Yeah, so do it.

50:23.783 --> 50:24.614
Oh.

50:27.623 --> 50:28.486
Shh.

50:30.726 --> 50:32.424
- Oh fuck.

50:35.030 --> 50:37.495
Now look at me, look at me.

50:38.835 --> 50:40.795
You'll be with her soon.

50:43.706 --> 50:46.772
Go to sleep.

50:46.907 --> 50:48.803
Sleep, Richard.

51:10.493 --> 51:12.497
Thank you, Richard.

52:05.481 --> 52:07.288
This is fucked up.

52:08.584 --> 52:11.226
This is all so fucked.

52:13.527 --> 52:16.627
I tried to kill
him just like her.

52:18.632 --> 52:21.566
She's gonna kill us
all anyway, isn't she?

52:22.707 --> 52:23.938
No, she isn't.

52:24.074 --> 52:25.603
We just have to figure it out.

52:28.339 --> 52:30.839
Hey L?
- Yeah.

52:32.614 --> 52:36.416
- Back there with Tracey,
what were you saying?

52:37.480 --> 52:38.616
What do you mean?

52:39.319 --> 52:40.382
- Sounded like scripture.

52:40.518 --> 52:42.721
How did you know all that?

52:42.856 --> 52:47.295
- Oh, that's, my Mom used to
take me to church every Sunday.

52:48.765 --> 52:49.726
Do you still go?

52:50.729 --> 52:52.927
- No, I stopped
going when I was 12.

52:54.504 --> 52:59.637
It's weird though, I
still remember, you know.

53:04.948 --> 53:06.678
- What does it all mean?

53:06.813 --> 53:12.221
- I think it just means
whatever you go through in life.

53:13.517 --> 53:14.751
It's all just temporary.

53:15.484 --> 53:16.753
It'll all pass.

53:42.651 --> 53:46.217
Sorry, Olivia, suicide
isn't the same as murder.

53:46.353 --> 53:47.817
You're doing well though,

53:47.952 --> 53:50.786
learning the darker
side of human nature.

53:50.922 --> 53:55.296
You're almost there, but
if you want to escape

53:55.431 --> 53:58.361
you can't just let a
person take their life.

53:58.497 --> 53:59.829
You must take it from them.

54:23.594 --> 54:26.658
When do you think that she's
going to make her move?

54:29.498 --> 54:31.465
She'll probably
wait till it's dark.

54:32.568 --> 54:35.566
Someone's going to die
when the lights go off.

54:35.702 --> 54:37.735
She's the one that
stabbed Tracey.

54:40.604 --> 54:41.739
Yeah, I think so too.

55:01.696 --> 55:05.763
- I can hear everything
you're saying, you know.

55:08.534 --> 55:11.637
This room is not very large.

55:12.670 --> 55:14.310
You should know that by now.

55:16.875 --> 55:20.345
- And you're right,
I killed her.

55:20.481 --> 55:21.911
I thought she was you, Alice.

55:23.148 --> 55:26.454
- Someone is going to die
when the lights go out.

55:27.785 --> 55:30.854
But right now I'm still alive.

55:31.989 --> 55:34.794
And so is the only
woman that I ever loved,

55:35.664 --> 55:38.092
and I intend to do
whatever I have to do

55:38.227 --> 55:42.531
to make sure that she
isn't going to die.

55:42.667 --> 55:44.505
Olivia, it's not worth it.

55:51.710 --> 55:54.009
Give yourself up to me, Sean.

55:58.720 --> 56:01.021
I'm willing to have
sex with you first

56:01.157 --> 56:02.820
if that's what you want.

56:06.563 --> 56:11.432
I will be gentle
afterwards, I promise.

56:11.568 --> 56:14.429
- Olivia, you're not
thinking clearly.

56:14.564 --> 56:15.831
- Yes, I am.

56:15.967 --> 56:17.801
Everything is very
clear right now.

56:17.937 --> 56:20.838
Clearer than it has
ever been, really.

56:22.278 --> 56:23.672
Olivia, we should all talk.

56:23.808 --> 56:25.778
- I'm tired of talking, Sean.

56:26.781 --> 56:28.747
Come on, there has to be
another way out of here.

56:28.882 --> 56:31.682
Look, we can use your
hatchet and my ax

56:31.818 --> 56:32.846
and we can chop
through the wall.

56:32.982 --> 56:34.549
We can still get out of here.

56:34.685 --> 56:36.491
And go where, Sean?

56:37.158 --> 56:38.625
Go where?

56:38.760 --> 56:41.188
You don't know what's
on the other side.

56:41.323 --> 56:44.466
There's no way out of
here except one way.

56:45.395 --> 56:46.435
No.

56:49.206 --> 56:51.840
You're not a killer, Sean.

56:51.975 --> 56:52.870
Look at you.

56:54.274 --> 56:56.071
Holding that ax.

56:57.212 --> 56:59.508
Olivia, just stop.

56:59.644 --> 57:00.878
I'm not gonna fight you.

57:02.845 --> 57:05.883
Good, surrender to me.

57:06.851 --> 57:09.751
- Olivia, please, don't do it.

57:09.886 --> 57:12.527
Look, I'm gonna drop my weapon.

57:15.561 --> 57:16.993
You have said too much.

57:18.334 --> 57:21.265
You will never be the same.

57:21.400 --> 57:22.438
- Olivia!

58:11.314 --> 58:12.915
I'm sorry I had to be
the one to push you

58:13.051 --> 58:15.216
into becoming who
you really are.

58:22.797 --> 58:25.665
If any of us is
pushed far enough

58:25.801 --> 58:28.796
there's no telling what
we will do to survive,

58:28.931 --> 58:30.671
so don't feel guilty.

58:31.472 --> 58:32.937
This is all my fault.

58:33.573 --> 58:35.138
- I don't feel guilty.

58:35.274 --> 58:39.511
I just know I did everything
I could to stay alive

58:39.646 --> 58:41.546
and you did everything you could

58:41.682 --> 58:43.981
to drive that poor girl crazy.

58:46.217 --> 58:49.190
- And yet, Sean, you
surprised me today.

58:49.326 --> 58:50.558
I thought you would give in

58:50.694 --> 58:52.761
to such a beautiful
girl like Olivia.

58:52.897 --> 58:57.593
I'm surprised you could
resist such a beautiful woman.

58:57.729 --> 58:59.535
What are you saying?

59:00.670 --> 59:03.505
- I know everything
about you, Sean.

59:03.640 --> 59:05.034
I know how you
brought another woman

59:05.170 --> 59:07.972
into your bed when
your wife was away.

59:10.246 --> 59:12.641
Where is my wife?

59:12.777 --> 59:14.176
Do you have my wife?

59:16.153 --> 59:17.614
Of course not.

59:17.750 --> 59:20.255
Why would I take your wife

59:20.390 --> 59:22.653
when clearly you don't care much

59:22.788 --> 59:24.857
about whether she's hurt or not?

59:28.996 --> 59:32.799
But, I have a person
that you really love.

59:33.799 --> 59:36.033
- Jacob, oh my God, Jacob.

59:37.802 --> 59:39.971
Jacob, are you okay?

59:41.870 --> 59:43.304
Where's my boy?

59:44.279 --> 59:45.647
Where's my boy?

59:46.884 --> 59:50.915
- And L, you are not so
innocent either, are you?

59:51.051 --> 59:53.247
The difference between
you and Sean is

59:53.383 --> 59:55.923
you hurt the person
you love the most.

59:56.926 --> 1:00:00.625
Remember, when you ran away
and you broke her heart?

1:00:00.761 --> 1:00:02.224
- What are you talking about?

1:00:09.501 --> 1:00:10.331
Mom?

1:00:13.571 --> 1:00:14.610
Leonard?

1:00:16.313 --> 1:00:18.075
Mom, where are you?

1:00:19.349 --> 1:00:21.276
Don't worry about me.

1:00:23.550 --> 1:00:25.016
Are you hurt?

1:00:26.449 --> 1:00:30.791
You know your Mama,
nothing can really hurt me.

1:00:31.926 --> 1:00:34.355
Mama, I was gonna
come back home.

1:00:36.531 --> 1:00:38.634
I'm gonna come get you.

1:00:40.030 --> 1:00:41.296
I'm still gonna come back.

1:00:43.499 --> 1:00:48.875
Final test, decide who
lives and who dies.

1:01:04.327 --> 1:01:05.991
This is fucked up.

1:01:07.628 --> 1:01:09.357
This is so fucked up.

1:01:16.334 --> 1:01:20.267
We're all just gonna
end up dead like them.

1:01:20.403 --> 1:01:23.977
I mean, for all we
know they're forcing us

1:01:24.112 --> 1:01:28.046
to kill each other but
my sister could be alive.

1:01:31.415 --> 1:01:33.984
I'm sorry, Alice, but
your sister's dead.

1:01:34.120 --> 1:01:36.087
I'm not gonna let
her kill my son.

1:01:36.856 --> 1:01:38.285
- Even if my sister's dead

1:01:38.421 --> 1:01:40.423
killing each other
isn't worth it.

1:01:40.559 --> 1:01:44.359
We're all acting like animals
slaughtering each other.

1:01:47.336 --> 1:01:48.165
She's right.

1:01:49.201 --> 1:01:51.168
The doctor's not
even in here, man.

1:01:52.403 --> 1:01:54.940
We're the ones getting
our hands dirty.

1:01:55.075 --> 1:01:56.976
She hasn't laid a
finger on anyone.

1:02:07.087 --> 1:02:11.452
Fucking Tracey,
she was pregnant.

1:02:13.094 --> 1:02:15.889
She would have done
anything for her baby.

1:02:16.925 --> 1:02:20.627
Sean, I know you would have
done anything for your child.

1:02:20.762 --> 1:02:25.500
And L, I know your Mom
would do anything for you.

1:02:26.470 --> 1:02:30.009
That doesn't mean that
we should keep playing.

1:02:30.145 --> 1:02:33.013
When the timer goes off,
the lights are gonna go out

1:02:33.149 --> 1:02:36.180
and she's going to want
for us to kill each other.

1:02:38.522 --> 1:02:40.888
We're not going anywhere.

1:02:41.755 --> 1:02:43.418
Might as well just stop.

1:03:01.070 --> 1:03:02.272
Richard was right.

1:03:04.178 --> 1:03:06.815
Richard was the only
one who was right.

1:03:08.749 --> 1:03:10.478
He died with dignity.

1:03:11.917 --> 1:03:13.848
He didn't kill anyone.

1:03:13.983 --> 1:03:15.384
Didn't even try.

1:03:17.826 --> 1:03:20.328
- You know she's right, Sean.

1:03:20.464 --> 1:03:22.094
I'm not gonna kill you.

1:03:22.229 --> 1:03:24.866
That's not what my Mom
would want anyways.

1:03:25.001 --> 1:03:27.295
It's a dark road and I'm
not going down it, man.

1:03:27.431 --> 1:03:29.064
- I don't want to
kill you either,

1:03:29.199 --> 1:03:32.472
but my son, they got my son.

1:03:32.608 --> 1:03:34.638
And I can't let him die.

1:03:34.773 --> 1:03:37.009
My son is eight.

1:03:37.144 --> 1:03:39.640
He hasn't had a
chance at life yet.

1:03:40.576 --> 1:03:44.612
I'm sorry, but I
gotta take you down.

1:03:44.747 --> 1:03:49.187
If there's even a chance of
saving him, I need to win.

1:03:50.790 --> 1:03:52.223
I'll get you.

1:03:53.326 --> 1:03:56.157
You walk around smiling,
acting all in charge,

1:03:56.293 --> 1:03:57.465
acting like you're a good guy

1:03:57.601 --> 1:03:59.032
till nobody's looking, man.

1:03:59.167 --> 1:04:03.067
Yeah, I'm not that
great of a guy, okay.

1:04:03.203 --> 1:04:05.804
But that little
boy there, he is.

1:04:05.940 --> 1:04:08.173
He got cancer when he was six.

1:04:08.308 --> 1:04:10.471
We were told that he
only had six months.

1:04:10.606 --> 1:04:13.310
His mother and I,
we fought for him.

1:04:15.947 --> 1:04:17.215
But you know what?

1:04:17.350 --> 1:04:20.152
Our relationship got to
the point where she left

1:04:21.322 --> 1:04:24.822
and I met someone to
help me take my mind away

1:04:24.957 --> 1:04:27.026
if just for a moment.

1:04:27.161 --> 1:04:30.893
I made a mistake and
I'm still sorry for it.

1:04:31.029 --> 1:04:32.329
- Well, congratulations.

1:04:33.570 --> 1:04:35.562
I'm a fuck up, okay?

1:04:35.698 --> 1:04:41.107
I admit it, but my son,
he's better than I am.

1:04:42.277 --> 1:04:44.209
I'm not going to let
some crazy lady kill him.

1:04:44.344 --> 1:04:46.746
You all may not think
that I'm a survivor

1:04:46.882 --> 1:04:48.616
but you know what, my son is.

1:04:48.752 --> 1:04:51.052
And I'm not gonna let him die.

1:04:52.022 --> 1:04:53.988
Yeah, we'll see when
the lights go off.

1:04:57.627 --> 1:04:59.094
- What about me, Sean?

1:05:00.330 --> 1:05:03.124
If you kill L, does that mean
you're going to kill me too?

1:05:03.259 --> 1:05:04.527
You lost your sister.

1:05:05.230 --> 1:05:07.998
You should do what Richard did

1:05:08.134 --> 1:05:10.066
and take yourself out of this.

1:05:10.202 --> 1:05:11.400
- You know what I said before

1:05:11.535 --> 1:05:13.808
about how we shouldn't
play anymore?

1:05:13.943 --> 1:05:16.341
I've changed my mind.
- What?

1:05:16.477 --> 1:05:19.779
- I've changed my mind.
I want to kill you, Sean,

1:05:19.914 --> 1:05:22.042
if it's the last thing I do.

1:05:22.177 --> 1:05:24.014
Watch it, Alice.

1:05:24.149 --> 1:05:26.151
Watch it, you stay out of this.

1:05:26.286 --> 1:05:28.755
- No, I'm in this
more now than ever

1:05:28.890 --> 1:05:30.524
and I'm ready for you, Sean.

1:05:30.660 --> 1:05:32.158
- You don't get it, man.

1:05:33.059 --> 1:05:34.024
You know how much anger it takes

1:05:34.160 --> 1:05:35.524
for people like us to survive?

1:05:37.298 --> 1:05:39.099
Man, you think 'cause
you killed some girl

1:05:39.235 --> 1:05:40.662
that was chasing after
you with an ax first,

1:05:40.798 --> 1:05:43.400
you can understand what
it takes to survive, man?

1:05:44.168 --> 1:05:45.371
You don't know shit!

1:05:46.408 --> 1:05:48.235
Every day of my life has
been about survival for me

1:05:48.371 --> 1:05:50.678
and the people that I love.

1:05:50.813 --> 1:05:51.845
Today isn't any different for me

1:05:51.980 --> 1:05:53.713
just because I'm
stuck here, man.

1:05:53.849 --> 1:05:55.146
Today's just another day,

1:05:55.282 --> 1:05:56.278
just another day
where I don't know

1:05:56.413 --> 1:05:57.885
if me or anybody
else that I love

1:05:58.021 --> 1:05:59.247
is gonna make it
through tomorrow.

1:05:59.383 --> 1:06:00.648
So welcome to my world, Sean.

1:06:00.783 --> 1:06:03.156
This is what's always
like for me, man.

1:06:06.088 --> 1:06:09.558
- You really think that you
can beat me with that knife?

1:06:11.263 --> 1:06:16.433
Hey L, Sean's right about me.

1:06:19.207 --> 1:06:21.669
I've got nothing
left to live for,

1:06:22.976 --> 1:06:24.441
but I'm still angry.

1:06:25.715 --> 1:06:27.411
That's still there.

1:06:28.514 --> 1:06:31.244
And I don't want to
see you win, Sean,

1:06:31.380 --> 1:06:33.681
even if it means I die.

1:06:34.889 --> 1:06:36.387
You want to know why?

1:06:38.420 --> 1:06:40.325
I just don't like you.

1:06:44.301 --> 1:06:48.068
That's not fair,
Alice, that's not fucking fair.

1:06:48.204 --> 1:06:51.334
- Shut up, people
like you always win.

1:06:51.470 --> 1:06:54.205
- It's not fair, that's
not fucking fair.

1:06:54.341 --> 1:06:56.473
It ain't Alice you
gotta worry about, Sean.

1:06:59.044 --> 1:07:00.114
- Come on, L.

1:07:01.245 --> 1:07:03.013
Okay, I'm not a killer.

1:07:03.148 --> 1:07:04.245
I'm just a dad, okay?

1:07:04.381 --> 1:07:06.015
I just want to save my kid.

1:07:06.151 --> 1:07:08.452
Please, just let me win.

1:07:10.486 --> 1:07:12.122
- Where are you going, Sean?

1:07:12.258 --> 1:07:14.429
Kill him, L!
- I will.

1:07:14.564 --> 1:07:15.492
- Come on!

1:07:33.848 --> 1:07:35.215
- No, no I can't!

1:07:37.586 --> 1:07:39.153
No, no!

1:07:43.726 --> 1:07:44.818
- Get off me!

1:07:47.090 --> 1:07:48.129
Alice!

1:07:53.397 --> 1:07:55.065
Thank you for helping me, Alice.

1:07:55.201 --> 1:07:58.106
- No Sean, don't do this.

1:08:04.440 --> 1:08:05.647
You tried to kill me.

1:08:05.782 --> 1:08:07.040
- I didn't touch you.

1:08:07.175 --> 1:08:10.710
Yeah, but you gave him a
machete so he could kill me.

1:08:10.846 --> 1:08:14.116
No! Seriously,
stop Sean, please.

1:08:14.252 --> 1:08:15.616
We're past that, Alice.

1:08:15.752 --> 1:08:18.252
I'm not gonna debate
this with you.

1:08:18.388 --> 1:08:19.588
What about your son?

1:08:19.723 --> 1:08:21.695
What kind of example
are you setting?

1:08:21.830 --> 1:08:23.229
- My son is dead!

1:08:23.364 --> 1:08:27.999
Choked, lifeless,
but you know what?

1:08:28.135 --> 1:08:29.868
We're all survivors, right?

1:08:30.004 --> 1:08:31.165
Is that right, huh?

1:08:31.300 --> 1:08:32.404
All of us!

1:08:33.404 --> 1:08:38.608
You, L, Richard, Olivia, Tracey,

1:08:39.981 --> 1:08:41.380
we're all survivors!

1:08:41.515 --> 1:08:45.083
You know what, it's
just that some of us

1:08:45.219 --> 1:08:46.615
are better at it than others.

1:08:46.750 --> 1:08:48.382
Yeah, but you don't
have to kill me,

1:08:48.518 --> 1:08:50.154
you don't have to do this.

1:08:50.290 --> 1:08:52.255
We can still get out of here.

1:08:52.390 --> 1:08:55.262
I'm done talking to you, Alice.

1:08:58.361 --> 1:08:59.392
Shut the fuck up!

1:08:59.528 --> 1:09:01.569
Shut the fuck up, L.

1:09:01.705 --> 1:09:02.665
- Please stop!

1:09:03.738 --> 1:09:04.970
Sean!

1:09:05.106 --> 1:09:09.236
Shh, shh, come on, Alice!

1:09:11.746 --> 1:09:14.009
Alice!

1:09:14.144 --> 1:09:15.381
Alice!

1:09:20.348 --> 1:09:21.387
Alice.

1:09:25.760 --> 1:09:26.990
Alice.

1:09:43.340 --> 1:09:45.146
You fucking bitch.

1:09:45.281 --> 1:09:47.644
I'd rather be a
bitch than a corpse.

1:10:29.057 --> 1:10:30.687
What are you doing?

1:10:32.259 --> 1:10:35.125
Don't you have any decency?

1:10:35.261 --> 1:10:37.899
- I do Alice, I do,

1:10:38.034 --> 1:10:40.296
but not everyone has the luxury.

1:10:40.432 --> 1:10:41.935
You must conclude the test.

1:10:42.071 --> 1:10:43.737
You have no other choice.

1:10:43.872 --> 1:10:44.833
You must go on.

1:10:46.436 --> 1:10:48.105
- Just do it.

1:10:48.241 --> 1:10:49.574
Just do it, just leave.

1:10:49.710 --> 1:10:52.011
- No, I'm going to get
you out of here, okay?

1:10:52.147 --> 1:10:54.381
I'm going to get you out.

1:10:56.085 --> 1:11:00.486
- Alice, you gotta leave.

1:11:00.622 --> 1:11:03.289
- No, I'm going to get
you out of here, okay?

1:11:03.425 --> 1:11:04.721
Don't worry, I'm
gonna get you out.

1:11:04.856 --> 1:11:06.793
You're gonna carry me
right out that door?

1:11:06.929 --> 1:11:08.362
- Yeah, yeah.

1:11:18.007 --> 1:11:19.136
Alice you gotta do this,

1:11:19.272 --> 1:11:20.902
you gotta end this.

1:11:25.642 --> 1:11:27.815
- Alice, you gotta leave.

1:11:27.951 --> 1:11:28.946
Just do it, alright?

1:11:29.081 --> 1:11:30.284
- No.

1:11:30.419 --> 1:11:33.453
I won't leave you,
I won't leave you.

1:11:36.321 --> 1:11:38.121
- I will soon.

1:11:38.257 --> 1:11:40.328
- No, no, no.

1:11:45.067 --> 1:11:50.030
Please, L. Stay with me.

1:11:57.711 --> 1:12:01.410
- There is a dark side
to obedience, Alice.

1:12:01.546 --> 1:12:03.648
Thank you for showing me.

1:12:03.783 --> 1:12:06.816
I have learned more
than I ever wanted to.

1:12:11.256 --> 1:12:13.020
Fuck you!

1:12:23.538 --> 1:12:26.566
- Alice, you have
no other choice.

1:12:26.701 --> 1:12:27.969
You must kill him.

1:12:36.746 --> 1:12:38.886
You have made it this far.

1:12:39.022 --> 1:12:40.651
You have to end it.

1:12:40.786 --> 1:12:43.583
Please embrace the
animal inside you.

1:12:43.718 --> 1:12:45.019
You must continue.

1:12:49.631 --> 1:12:52.829
- I'm not going to,
I'm not going to.

1:12:55.204 --> 1:12:57.768
Then you will die together.

1:13:04.744 --> 1:13:08.676
- Alice, Alice?
- No, no, no, no.

1:13:08.812 --> 1:13:11.850
Look at me, Alice, look at me.

1:13:12.786 --> 1:13:17.187
You have to do this
to save yourself, ok?

1:13:17.322 --> 1:13:18.022
- Kill me.

1:13:18.157 --> 1:13:18.987
Do it.

1:13:22.791 --> 1:13:24.861
- Just close your eyes.

1:13:26.463 --> 1:13:27.901
Go to sleep.

1:14:36.136 --> 1:14:36.966
Hello?

1:14:39.140 --> 1:14:39.936
Can you hear me?

1:14:56.057 --> 1:14:57.321
No, no!

1:14:57.457 --> 1:15:00.453
No, let me out of here!

1:15:00.588 --> 1:15:01.958
No!

1:16:20.610 --> 1:16:25.811
waited for you

1:16:34.691 --> 1:16:39.891
call the choirs

1:17:23.267 --> 1:17:28.676
made of love
