Woman 2:
I'm telling you,
it's a planet again.

01:17.494 --> 01:19.316
Pluto was always
a planet.

01:19.416 --> 01:22.840
No, it wasn't.
Now it is again.

01:22.940 --> 01:24.241
This is like when you
tried to tell me

01:24.341 --> 01:25.563
a strawberry is a nut.

01:25.663 --> 01:26.964
Strawberry is a nut. No.

01:27.064 --> 01:29.286
Anything with seeds
on the outside is a nut?

01:29.386 --> 01:31.388
A raspberry?
A nut.

01:32.309 --> 01:34.451
I hate your cunt heart.

01:36.193 --> 01:38.656
My tots are done.
Oh, whoopie.

01:38.756 --> 01:40.738
So, what are we going
to watch tonight?

01:40.838 --> 01:43.340
You want to keep going
with "Euphorica"?

01:43.440 --> 01:46.463
Kids who think they invented
fucking? No, thank you.

01:46.563 --> 01:49.426
Oh shit. Goddamn Fletchers
have the remote.

01:49.526 --> 01:51.949
Hey, Fletchers.
We're gonna watch "Shark Tank."

01:52.049 --> 01:54.912
Majority rules
the remote.

01:55.012 --> 01:57.554
Majority rules
my foot up your ass.

01:57.654 --> 01:59.156
What is this garbage?

01:59.256 --> 02:00.958
So you finish
"Quaintsfordshire Murders"

02:01.058 --> 02:03.721
and now you want us to care
about who dies in Norway?

02:03.821 --> 02:06.644
Shh!
The blonde did it.

02:06.744 --> 02:08.746
Bitches.

02:12.509 --> 02:15.492
Ooh, Irene, did you charge
your heartcuff?

02:15.592 --> 02:17.594
I sure did, Billy.

02:19.476 --> 02:21.498
That's hilarious
because, um, I'm showing:

02:21.598 --> 02:24.381
Irene. Zero percent.
No transmission.

02:24.481 --> 02:26.784
Oh, you want to track
my every movement,

02:26.884 --> 02:29.066
so you know every time
I go to the bathroom

02:29.166 --> 02:30.988
so you can jerk it
to the knowledge

02:31.088 --> 02:32.269
that I'm pooping.

02:32.369 --> 02:33.710
It's not a GPS, Irene,

02:33.810 --> 02:34.912
all it does is track
your vital signs.

02:35.012 --> 02:36.994
Not gonna chip me
like some dog.

02:37.094 --> 02:38.035
Woof!

02:40.577 --> 02:42.039
Last chance.

02:42.139 --> 02:44.721
Last chance to sign up
for the zoo trip.

02:44.821 --> 02:47.724
Oh, sure. Great.

02:47.824 --> 02:50.327
Oh, wait, though.

02:50.427 --> 02:52.729
Will we get back in time
to change our diapers

02:52.829 --> 02:55.212
and to watch "Teletubbies"?

02:55.312 --> 02:57.895
We're not
fuckin' toddlers, Betty.

02:57.995 --> 02:59.576
We've seen emus before.

02:59.676 --> 03:00.938
If you can't
make an effort

03:01.038 --> 03:03.260
to be a more positive
community presence,

03:03.360 --> 03:05.662
I may have to report

03:05.762 --> 03:08.705
your illegal drug plants
to the administration.

03:08.805 --> 03:10.067
No, no, no, no.

03:10.167 --> 03:12.669
No, no, no.
Our life-saving medicine.

03:12.769 --> 03:14.471
I know you
don't have glaucoma.

03:14.571 --> 03:16.353
And I, and I hate this

03:16.453 --> 03:18.355
witchy Chinese game
you're playing.

03:18.455 --> 03:19.636
What are these, runes?

03:19.736 --> 03:20.958
That's right, Betty.

03:21.058 --> 03:24.361
We're Satanists
who love drugs.

03:27.744 --> 03:29.746
What a fucking cop.

03:33.150 --> 03:34.451
Alright now.

03:34.551 --> 03:36.373
So we have you
on our third floor.

03:36.473 --> 03:38.535
That's our
medical care unit.

03:38.635 --> 03:41.618
I can give you a full tour
of the facilities.

03:41.718 --> 03:44.021
And get you set up on
our heartcuff system.

03:44.121 --> 03:46.403
But I'll let you
get settled in first.

04:00.937 --> 04:03.059

what I'm thinkin'?

06:28.564 --> 06:29.826

06:29.926 --> 06:31.988
The animals aren't
going anywhere.

06:32.088 --> 06:34.110
We can't miss
the orangutan show.

06:34.210 --> 06:35.551
She's very impressive.

Velcro is impressive.

07:52.768 --> 07:54.770
you came back.

08:20.156 --> 08:23.899
It's 11:10.
The bus is going to leave.

08:23.999 --> 08:26.542
I got to piss.
What the hell is she
doing in there?

08:26.642 --> 08:28.744
I don't know
what to tell you people.

08:28.844 --> 08:29.945
She has diarrhea.

08:30.045 --> 08:31.787
That's it.
I've had it.

08:31.887 --> 08:32.828
The bus is ready.

08:32.928 --> 08:34.930
Betty. Betty!

08:35.651 --> 08:37.153
Oh. Good.

08:37.253 --> 08:39.074
You gonna help me wipe?

08:39.174 --> 08:42.478
Because my crevices
have crevices.

08:42.578 --> 08:44.580
Excuse me.
Finally!

09:03.999 --> 09:05.621
Big deal.

09:05.721 --> 09:07.182
Attention.

09:07.282 --> 09:08.944
Would our guests
from Mossy Oaks retirement

09:09.044 --> 09:10.746
please meet
the zookeeper liaison

09:10.846 --> 09:12.628
in the primate area.

09:12.728 --> 09:14.870
Melanie is performing now.

09:18.694 --> 09:21.236
Okay.
I think this is good.

09:21.336 --> 09:23.479
Right here? Okay.
Hmm.

09:23.579 --> 09:25.581
Here. Let's do this.

09:26.742 --> 09:28.644
Okay. You ready?

09:28.744 --> 09:31.126
Yeah. I'm good.

09:31.226 --> 09:33.809
You don't look ready.
I'm just-- I'm good. Just--

09:48.243 --> 09:49.184
Girl?

09:50.486 --> 09:51.627
You good?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:51.727 --> 09:53.729
Take, take this off.

09:56.331 --> 09:57.513
I'm not getting a pulse.

09:57.613 --> 09:59.615
Go, go!

10:02.257 --> 10:04.259
Charging.

10:05.621 --> 10:07.523
Clear.

10:07.623 --> 10:09.625
And clear.

10:10.225 --> 10:11.406
Mm-hmm.

10:27.282 --> 10:28.984
Oh dear,
who is that?

10:29.084 --> 10:31.026
Uh, new guy
from 312, Ben.

10:31.126 --> 10:33.128
Heart attack.

11:16.131 --> 11:18.914
Does the perfect murder exist?

11:19.014 --> 11:21.376
This, I have asked
the owls.

11:28.463 --> 11:30.245
Shh!

11:30.345 --> 11:33.248
Hey, do you mind?
Sorry.

11:33.348 --> 11:36.291
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't worry about
the Fletchers.

11:36.391 --> 11:38.733
Oh, the Fletchers. Thanks.

11:38.833 --> 11:40.375
I got to say,
they seem very hard-core.

11:40.475 --> 11:41.416
What are they, Dutch?

11:41.516 --> 11:43.178
No, just into murder,

11:43.278 --> 11:44.940
very rude.

11:45.040 --> 11:47.382
Now, me, I would
never tell a lady

11:47.482 --> 11:49.484
when to stop sucking.

11:54.009 --> 11:55.470
What the fuck, dude?

11:55.570 --> 11:56.791
Pete,

11:56.891 --> 11:58.954
stop pestering
the new girl, come on.

11:59.054 --> 12:01.736
And don't forget to sign up
for the zoo trip next week.

12:02.857 --> 12:05.240
That is
a very pervy guy.

12:05.340 --> 12:07.442
It's Pervy Pete.
Explains it.

12:07.542 --> 12:09.364
Steer clear
of his entire gang,

12:09.464 --> 12:11.246
Chlamydia Cal
and Gonorrhoea Greg.

12:11.346 --> 12:12.727
They're creeps.

12:12.827 --> 12:14.409
Well, at least truth
in advertising, huh?

12:14.509 --> 12:16.851
Actually, I think it's Greg
that has Chlamydia.

12:16.951 --> 12:20.936
Aha. So, kind of
an Iceland-Greenland scenario.

12:21.036 --> 12:23.618
I know everything
about everyone who lives here.

12:23.718 --> 12:25.900
Just stick with me.
I'm Betty.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.002
Hopefully not Botulism Betty.

12:30.405 --> 12:31.746
Most people don't realise
all the things

12:31.846 --> 12:33.028
you can do
with an Instapot.

12:33.128 --> 12:35.910
Cheesecake.
Denver omelet.

12:36.010 --> 12:38.913
I once made
a beef bourguignon
in 22 minutes.

12:41.816 --> 12:44.039
Ladies, would you
please turn

12:44.139 --> 12:46.141
your ghetto blaster down?

12:51.346 --> 12:52.767
Watch out
for these two.

12:52.867 --> 12:54.729
They're felons.

12:54.829 --> 12:57.132
And junkies. Right.

12:57.232 --> 12:59.894
Ah. Real den
of iniquity, this place.

12:59.994 --> 13:02.417
Whatever you do,
stay away

13:02.517 --> 13:04.139
from Joyce
and Irene.

13:09.964 --> 13:11.786
I don't want to know.

13:11.886 --> 13:13.548
I really don't.

13:13.648 --> 13:15.069
Ah!
That was awful.

13:15.169 --> 13:16.591
You guys are trouncing me,

13:16.691 --> 13:18.273
'cause you are a pair
of shuffle sharks.

13:18.373 --> 13:21.476
Your form is off.
You're too tense.

13:21.576 --> 13:22.917
You need to loosen up.
What? No. I'm loose.

13:23.017 --> 13:25.360
That's my whole thing.
Am I not loose?

13:25.460 --> 13:27.822
You should try
rage therapy.
What's that?

13:36.110 --> 13:37.492
That shit feels good.

13:37.592 --> 13:39.254
Hey, you, come on.
Reach deep.

13:39.354 --> 13:41.095
It starts
in the labia.

13:41.195 --> 13:43.478
Mm-mm.
You know...

13:44.278 --> 13:45.500
I think

13:45.600 --> 13:47.502
that I'm fine
with bottling.

13:47.602 --> 13:49.904
I-- you don't want
to see me unbottled.

13:50.004 --> 13:52.947
You can't, you can't
handle the unbottled.

13:53.047 --> 13:55.069
Well, the thing
that got us

13:55.169 --> 13:56.431
through our stint
at Bedford Hills.

13:56.531 --> 13:58.232
Yeah.

13:58.332 --> 14:01.075
Crazy. You kids were
really inside, huh?
Upstate.

14:01.175 --> 14:03.358
We were political prisoners.

14:03.458 --> 14:04.639
Wow, no shit.

14:04.739 --> 14:06.321
No shit whatsoever.

14:06.421 --> 14:08.042
How'd you get into that?

14:08.142 --> 14:11.766
I was in college.
It was a turbulent time.

14:11.866 --> 14:14.649
Oh yeah. I mean, the '60s.
Did you hear that?

14:14.749 --> 14:16.170
The '70s, bitch.
Oh, right.

14:16.270 --> 14:17.732
You know, I was going
to say the '90s

14:17.832 --> 14:19.253
because of all
the flannel.

14:19.353 --> 14:20.735
You'd have been
better off going there.

14:20.835 --> 14:22.256
I'm so sorry,

14:22.356 --> 14:23.698
just a pair of tweens
and a shuffleboard.

14:26.320 --> 14:27.582
Whoa-whoa!

14:27.682 --> 14:29.684
Irene!
Yeah, that's right.

14:31.285 --> 14:33.227
Very straight edge.

14:33.327 --> 14:35.269
I mean, not at all
what I was expecting.

14:35.369 --> 14:36.911
Yeah, I was on
the straight and narrow

14:37.011 --> 14:38.993
before I met
my guardian devil.

14:39.093 --> 14:40.034
What?
Yeah.

14:40.134 --> 14:41.075
She was shouting down

14:41.175 --> 14:42.597
some coeds on the quad,

14:42.697 --> 14:44.238
and I heard
what she was saying

14:44.338 --> 14:45.800
and my brain opened up.

14:45.900 --> 14:47.902
World didn't make sense
before that...

14:48.502 --> 14:49.804
and then it did.

14:49.904 --> 14:51.085
It's adorable.

14:51.185 --> 14:53.187
She brought me
into the group.

14:55.029 --> 14:57.031
Changed my life.

14:57.872 --> 14:59.874
Introduced me
to Gabriel.

15:01.235 --> 15:02.857
Ooh-la-la.

15:02.957 --> 15:05.419
Who's this Gabriel?
What, who's Gabriel?

15:05.519 --> 15:07.261
Gabriel started
the group.

15:07.361 --> 15:09.223
He recruited me and...

15:09.323 --> 15:12.707
...he trained us,
inspired us.
Trained us.

15:12.807 --> 15:15.750
He was our...
he was our guiding light.

15:15.850 --> 15:17.031
I see what's happening here.

15:17.131 --> 15:18.472
I'm getting
a real magnetic vibe.

15:18.572 --> 15:19.914
Like a cult leader
with pretty eyes.

15:20.014 --> 15:21.676
Ehh, he looked like
one of those white guys

15:21.776 --> 15:23.517
you see in the picture frames
that you buy from Target.

15:23.617 --> 15:24.999
Excuse me.

15:25.099 --> 15:26.200
No excuse you.
Irene, you're nuts. Uh-uh.

15:26.300 --> 15:29.523
Excuse me.
Gabriel was hot.

15:29.623 --> 15:31.165
Okay, I'm gonna
split the diff.

15:31.265 --> 15:34.488
I'm gonna picture
my high school French teacher.

15:34.588 --> 15:37.211
One thing's
for sure though...

15:37.311 --> 15:40.094
Dick like a fire hydrant!

15:40.194 --> 15:42.777
Oh, good for Gabriel.
Everyone enjoys it.

15:42.877 --> 15:45.019
Yes. Well done, Gabriel.

15:45.119 --> 15:46.941
Gabriel was more
than that.

15:47.041 --> 15:48.903
You know, he, he knew
that we could make

15:49.003 --> 15:50.264
the world a better place

15:50.364 --> 15:53.647
if we hold the assholes
to account.

15:54.248 --> 15:55.309
You feel me?

15:55.409 --> 15:57.111
I feel you.
That was Gabriel.

15:57.211 --> 15:58.632
I feel you, I'm--

15:58.732 --> 16:00.434
I am picking up
what you're putting down.

16:00.534 --> 16:03.517
And I gotta say, you two
are the coolest motherfuckers

16:03.617 --> 16:05.639
I have met
in a very long time.

16:05.739 --> 16:08.843
Seriously. I mean, sorry
to curse, but necessary.

16:08.943 --> 16:11.005
Cool.
So what happened after that?

16:11.105 --> 16:13.107
What happened
after he recruited you?

16:15.109 --> 16:17.111
We went to work.

16:25.719 --> 16:27.461
♪ Hold on ♪

16:27.561 --> 16:29.023
♪ Ngozi Family ♪

16:29.123 --> 16:30.824
I got to say,
it sounds like

16:30.924 --> 16:32.786
I was born
in the wrong time.

16:32.886 --> 16:34.628
We were starting
to get a reputation.

16:34.728 --> 16:36.390
A band even put
our picture

16:36.490 --> 16:37.751
on the cover of their album,

16:37.851 --> 16:38.832
The Droopy Hues.

16:38.932 --> 16:41.155
The Droopy Hues.

16:41.255 --> 16:43.797
Gosh, what an awful name
for a band.

16:43.897 --> 16:46.019
Were they any good?
Awful.

17:13.687 --> 17:14.628
You mean like...

17:14.728 --> 17:17.431
Uh, Charlie. Yes.

17:17.531 --> 17:19.533
But... together.

17:20.414 --> 17:22.676
Okay.
The Euphorica generation

17:22.776 --> 17:24.598
can't handle the heat?

17:24.698 --> 17:27.121
Euphoria?
How old do you think I am?

17:27.221 --> 17:28.762
Don't forget to charge
your heartcuff, Irene.

17:28.862 --> 17:30.204
And don't forget
to take your head

17:30.304 --> 17:31.965
out of
the man's ass, Billy.

17:34.308 --> 17:36.730
You know you don't
live here, right?

17:36.830 --> 17:38.011
Is that Elaine's cardigan?

17:38.111 --> 17:39.373
You know what,
I found it

17:39.473 --> 17:40.814
in the, uh,
the lost and found,

17:40.914 --> 17:42.296
which I got to say
is stellar.

17:42.396 --> 17:43.777
So much stuff in there.

17:43.877 --> 17:45.018
No, it's, uh,
it's actually not lost.

17:45.118 --> 17:47.381
Um, she had
an aneurysm and died...

17:47.481 --> 17:48.702
in that sweater.

17:48.802 --> 17:50.184
Yeah, it smells
like Icy Hot

17:50.284 --> 17:52.586
and a life well lived.

17:52.686 --> 17:54.828
She's gone full Cocoon.

17:54.928 --> 17:56.430
Billy, will you marry me?

17:56.530 --> 17:58.812
Hey, Billy, Billy.

18:00.334 --> 18:03.116
So, you're living,
you're loving,

18:03.216 --> 18:05.218
you're changing the world.

18:05.699 --> 18:07.701
What went wrong?

18:08.742 --> 18:11.425
Oh, we were planning
our most direct action.

18:13.106 --> 18:15.128
It was
the real revolution.

18:15.228 --> 18:17.050
We were gonna
set the world on fire.

18:19.713 --> 18:21.335
We were on the cusp.

18:21.435 --> 18:22.936
That's when it
always happens, right?

18:37.651 --> 18:38.592
It was a raid.

18:43.697 --> 18:45.699
So that's how...

18:46.580 --> 18:48.121
that's how you
got arrested?

18:48.221 --> 18:51.284
Their plan wasn't
to arrest us.

18:51.384 --> 18:55.649
They came in there
with guns blazing.

18:55.749 --> 18:59.152
We all tried
to run, but...

19:02.596 --> 19:04.598
Irene...

19:08.001 --> 19:10.383
Irene was brave.

19:10.483 --> 19:13.466
She couldn't leave
Gabriel behind.

19:13.566 --> 19:15.428
You, on the ground,
on the ground!

19:17.490 --> 19:19.833
Hey, look at me,
I got you.

19:19.933 --> 19:21.314
Hey, I got you, okay.

19:21.414 --> 19:22.916
I can't feel my legs.
I got you.

19:24.738 --> 19:26.159
I can't feel my legs.

19:26.259 --> 19:28.261
I can't feel my legs.

19:37.030 --> 19:39.312
They took, took everything.

19:41.715 --> 19:43.717
My legs...

19:46.119 --> 19:48.261
our freedom.

19:48.361 --> 19:50.363
And Gabriel.

19:53.807 --> 19:55.809
Just hope he didn't suffer.

19:57.690 --> 20:00.213
But we'll never know.

20:00.814 --> 20:02.916
Ah.

20:03.016 --> 20:04.517
Phew.

20:04.617 --> 20:07.600
Fucking Christ, man.
You two.

20:07.700 --> 20:10.383
All that loss
and you keep moving forward,

20:11.224 --> 20:13.226
living your lives.

20:13.907 --> 20:15.568
Forgive and forget, right?

20:15.668 --> 20:17.210
Oh, sweetie.

20:17.310 --> 20:19.312
No.

20:21.034 --> 20:23.036
We never forgive.

20:33.406 --> 20:35.148
We have yoga, swimming,

20:35.248 --> 20:36.669
Pilates,
if that interests you.

20:38.211 --> 20:40.193
Alright, if I can get
your signature

20:40.293 --> 20:42.295
right here.

20:42.855 --> 20:44.437
Sign on the bottom.

20:44.537 --> 20:46.599
Alright. We have you
in a suite

20:46.699 --> 20:49.682
on our third floor,
our medical care unit.

20:49.782 --> 20:51.724
I can give you a full tour
of the facilities

20:51.824 --> 20:53.887
and get you set up
with our heartcuff system.

20:53.987 --> 20:56.449
But, uh, I'll let y'all
get settled in first.

20:56.549 --> 20:58.691
Okay, what else,
what else, uh...

20:58.791 --> 21:01.454
okay, I think you guys
are ready to come on up
to the third floor.

21:01.554 --> 21:03.016
Let's go!
Actually,

21:03.116 --> 21:04.577
I have someone to carry
those bags for you.

21:04.677 --> 21:06.679
Charlie!

21:14.207 --> 21:15.668
Alright, Uncle Ben,

21:15.768 --> 21:18.010
I've got to hit the road.

21:18.971 --> 21:20.973
I, uh...

21:21.734 --> 21:23.736
love you.

21:33.346 --> 21:35.088
I'm his nephew.

21:35.188 --> 21:37.190
Sure.

21:39.952 --> 21:41.954
Want me to, uh,
close that window?

21:42.875 --> 21:44.057
No, I like the cold.

21:44.157 --> 21:46.159
Ah!

21:48.441 --> 21:50.443
So, where are you from?

21:50.803 --> 21:52.545
Nowhere.

21:52.645 --> 21:53.986
You got any visitors?

21:54.086 --> 21:55.748
Uh, 'cause I can let
the front know,

21:55.848 --> 21:57.310
this place can be
a real maze.

21:57.410 --> 21:59.412
I got no one.

22:05.898 --> 22:07.400
Alright.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.502

22:58.831 --> 23:00.873
But I knew your eyes.

23:03.836 --> 23:07.660
I've thought about
this moment for years,

23:07.760 --> 23:11.684
imagining what I'd do
and what I'd say...

23:13.526 --> 23:15.528

I finally found you...

and I, I couldn't
stop them.

24:25.998 --> 24:28.000
Not on my own.

24:30.362 --> 24:33.265
I know I did
the right thing.

24:33.365 --> 24:36.068
But it kills me
that I had to hurt

24:36.168 --> 24:38.170
the ones I loved.

24:39.091 --> 24:41.093
It kills you?

24:42.414 --> 24:44.757
Man, we lost...

24:44.857 --> 24:47.539
decades of our lives.

24:49.061 --> 24:53.585
I lost
my goddamn legs.

24:54.506 --> 24:55.888
I know.

24:55.988 --> 24:57.810
I'm sorry.

24:57.910 --> 24:59.912
That's why I'm here.

25:01.994 --> 25:03.996
I have this dream

25:04.596 --> 25:06.658
where I see...

25:06.758 --> 25:10.022
the two of you in a crowd,
and I follow you.

25:10.122 --> 25:14.506
For miles.
For miles and miles
until my feet bleed.

25:14.606 --> 25:16.608
I try to explain myself.

25:17.369 --> 25:19.551
But you never turn around.

25:19.651 --> 25:21.653
In 50 years...

25:22.614 --> 25:24.796
you never turn around.

25:24.896 --> 25:27.159
And I realised that

25:27.259 --> 25:28.600
the dream
would never change

25:28.700 --> 25:30.702
until I told you
the truth.

25:33.465 --> 25:35.467
Can you please forgive me?

25:47.279 --> 25:49.281
Sure, Gabriel.

25:52.524 --> 25:54.526
We forgive you.

26:10.061 --> 26:12.724
You thinkin'
what I'm thinkin'?

26:12.824 --> 26:15.687
We have to kill
that motherfucker.

26:15.787 --> 26:19.491
It's 11:10.
The bus is going to leave.

26:19.591 --> 26:22.534
I got to piss.
What the hell is
she doing in there?

26:22.634 --> 26:24.576
Look, I don't know
what to tell you people.

26:24.676 --> 26:26.898
She has diarrhea.

26:26.998 --> 26:29.861
Bullshitting about shitting
Rock on, ladies. Great.

26:29.961 --> 26:31.623
The bus is ready.

26:31.723 --> 26:33.705
All aboard for the zoo.

26:33.805 --> 26:35.867
Attention. Would our guests

26:35.967 --> 26:37.789
from Mossy Oaks
Retirement please...

26:37.889 --> 26:40.552
Hey, ladies.
I almost forgot.

26:40.652 --> 26:41.913
Check it out.

26:42.013 --> 26:43.475
I scored it on Etsy.

26:43.575 --> 26:45.076
Droopy Hues.

26:45.176 --> 26:48.059
Okay, let's settle this.
Which one is our friend Gabriel?

26:49.060 --> 26:51.062
Um...

26:51.943 --> 26:52.924
Huh.

26:53.024 --> 26:54.286
Not what I was expecting.

26:54.386 --> 26:57.249
But you did not over-hype
the D-train.

26:57.349 --> 26:59.851
Yeah. Yeah. Uh...

26:59.951 --> 27:02.294
Alright, so you guys coming
to see this chimp show?

27:02.394 --> 27:04.536
No, you know,
we're going to pass on it.

27:04.636 --> 27:07.619
We, uh, we have
an allergy.

27:07.719 --> 27:09.581
To monkey dander.

27:09.681 --> 27:11.463
Yeah.
Ah. Bullshit.

27:11.563 --> 27:13.024
And big mistake.

27:13.124 --> 27:14.906
Enjoy gettin' high.

27:15.006 --> 27:16.508
And catch you
on the flipside.

27:16.608 --> 27:18.590
On the flipside, baby.
Alright, ladies.

27:18.690 --> 27:20.151
Let's go, down here.

27:20.251 --> 27:22.674
Wait for me, chimpanzee.

27:25.256 --> 27:26.678
Now, Melanie,

27:26.778 --> 27:29.340
can you tell me
what time it is?

27:35.627 --> 27:37.048
2:23.

27:37.148 --> 27:38.570
Excellent!
Wow!

27:38.670 --> 27:40.371
That's amazing.

27:40.471 --> 27:41.813
Oh man.

27:41.913 --> 27:44.115
Joyce and Irene
are really missing out.

27:47.438 --> 27:49.440
Deviants.

27:51.683 --> 27:53.685
Very uptight.

27:56.808 --> 27:58.229
We weren't even gone
half a day.

27:58.329 --> 27:59.310
What was it this time?

27:59.410 --> 28:01.412
Oh, new guy. Ben.

28:02.734 --> 28:04.736
Oh shit.
Uh, excuse me.

28:05.937 --> 28:07.939
Man!

28:08.379 --> 28:10.361
Who was Ben?

28:10.461 --> 28:11.843
That's a,

28:11.943 --> 28:13.404
that's a question
for each of us

28:13.504 --> 28:15.506
to answer for ourselves.

28:17.308 --> 28:18.570
And so,

28:18.670 --> 28:20.531
let us take
a moment of silence

28:20.631 --> 28:22.794
to reflect on Ben's life

28:23.995 --> 28:26.457
and what he meant
to each of us.

28:26.557 --> 28:29.500
Psst. Hey, fake nephew.

28:29.600 --> 28:31.703
Sorry for your loss, man.
Scoot over.

28:31.803 --> 28:33.905
Why are you...

28:34.005 --> 28:35.346
I'm a real nephew.

28:35.446 --> 28:38.149
Oh. Listen, I don't care
why you're lying.

28:38.249 --> 28:39.631
You know, if it was

28:39.731 --> 28:41.312
a sugar daddy situation
or whatever,

28:41.412 --> 28:43.414
It wasn't-- Oh.

28:44.655 --> 28:45.877
He was my uncle.

28:45.977 --> 28:47.158
Oh, sugar uncle?

28:47.258 --> 28:49.040
Regular uncle. No sugar.

28:49.140 --> 28:51.322
Aren't you, like,
the bellhop?

28:51.422 --> 28:54.966
You didn't know him.
Why are you here?

28:55.066 --> 28:56.928
Well, he just,
he seemed sad.

28:57.028 --> 29:00.411
Like, he didn't have anyone,
you know.

29:00.511 --> 29:03.614
I figured I could
show up here at least,

29:03.714 --> 29:05.716
you know.

29:07.879 --> 29:10.862
The truth is, oh, I mean,
I shouldn't tell you this,

29:10.962 --> 29:12.964
but he's dead now,
so it's probably...

29:16.247 --> 29:19.210
Ben was in witness protection.
I was his case agent.

29:24.015 --> 29:26.597
Wow. No shit. Hmm.

29:26.697 --> 29:29.240
So you're, like, FBI?

29:29.340 --> 29:31.602
Technically.
I mean, yes, I am.

29:31.702 --> 29:33.444
It's just...

29:33.544 --> 29:36.527
I thought I'd be, you know,
fighting the war on terror.

29:36.627 --> 29:38.209
Instead, I'm getting
groceries for guys

29:38.309 --> 29:40.511
whose testimony
was relevant
before I was born.

29:41.953 --> 29:44.255
Never mind that I'm fluent
in fucking Urdu.

29:44.355 --> 29:46.217
Oh wow. Yeah.

29:46.317 --> 29:48.319
Thank you.

29:50.281 --> 29:53.424
So was he, like, Mafia?

29:53.524 --> 29:54.946
Did he do wet work?

29:55.046 --> 29:57.048
I've said
too much already.

29:58.929 --> 30:02.113
Gosh, where do I know
this guy from?

30:02.213 --> 30:03.434
Was he on TV
or something?

30:03.534 --> 30:05.536
I don't think so.

30:08.819 --> 30:10.841
Fire hydrant.

30:10.941 --> 30:12.723
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

30:12.823 --> 30:14.965
Droopy Hues.
Droop-- What?

30:15.065 --> 30:17.688
Yeah, that's Gabriel.
Look at his dick.

30:17.788 --> 30:20.251
Y-yes. What?
How do you know that?

30:20.351 --> 30:22.453
Well, not to brag,
but I'm friends

30:22.553 --> 30:23.934
with these pretty
super cool chicks,

30:24.034 --> 30:25.376
Joyce and Irene,
who live here,

30:25.476 --> 30:27.458
and they were telling me
about their old flame.

30:27.558 --> 30:30.061
Ow, dude.
Joyce Carter
and Irene Smothers.

30:30.161 --> 30:31.462
Yes, Joyce and Irene.

30:31.562 --> 30:33.504
Joyce Carter
and Irene Smothers
are here?

30:33.604 --> 30:35.806
Yeah, they're my buds.
We Mahjong. Why?

30:37.168 --> 30:38.709
Fuck.

30:40.010 --> 30:42.012

30:55.145 --> 30:56.847

down, down, down ♪

30:59.670 --> 31:01.832

31:02.753 --> 31:03.934
Charlie.

31:04.034 --> 31:06.136
They use illegal drugs.

31:06.236 --> 31:08.899
They have zero respect
for quiet time.

31:08.999 --> 31:10.741
And at the zoo,

31:10.841 --> 31:13.904
they were doing some kind of
sexual zapping.

31:14.004 --> 31:16.066
And at Peter's
birthday party,

31:16.166 --> 31:18.028
they both had
two pieces of cake.

31:18.128 --> 31:19.670
And I, I didn't get any.

31:19.770 --> 31:21.672
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you for sharing

31:21.772 --> 31:23.994
all of this
very helpful information.

31:24.094 --> 31:26.256
Those two are no good.

31:29.980 --> 31:32.563
What a fucking cop.

31:32.663 --> 31:35.045
Okay, so the heartcuff data
pins the time of death

31:35.145 --> 31:36.887
when Joyce and Irene
were at the zoo,

31:36.987 --> 31:38.489
so they didn't kill Gabriel.

31:38.589 --> 31:40.811
Well, I could have
told you that.

31:40.911 --> 31:42.693
Well, normally, if someone
in witness protection meets

31:42.793 --> 31:46.457
the people he,
you know, witnessed

31:46.557 --> 31:48.098
and then
suddenly drops dead...

31:48.198 --> 31:50.621
Wait, are you saying that Ben
or Gabriel or whatever,

31:50.721 --> 31:52.823
he's the guy
that ratted them out.

31:52.923 --> 31:54.385
Oh God.
I'm just so, so dumb.

31:54.485 --> 31:56.306
He said he wanted
to transfer here,

31:56.406 --> 31:58.268
and I said, "Mossy Oaks.
Sounds nice."

31:58.368 --> 32:00.030
I did zero research whatsoever.

32:00.130 --> 32:02.633
Oh, yes.
No, that is not
very thorough.

32:02.733 --> 32:04.755
But, uh, don't beat
yourself up.

32:04.855 --> 32:06.637
'Cause guess what,
they didn't kill him.

32:06.737 --> 32:08.679
I mean, with the zoo
and the time,

32:08.779 --> 32:10.080
and I know them,

32:10.180 --> 32:11.802
these guys
are cool as shit.

32:11.902 --> 32:13.964
Okay? They are
not murderers.

32:14.064 --> 32:17.327
Charlie, Joyce and Irene
are not cool as shit.

32:17.427 --> 32:18.769
They're domestic terrorists.

32:18.869 --> 32:20.130
Alright, Mr. Man.

32:20.230 --> 32:21.732
Do you know
what they were planning

32:21.832 --> 32:23.774
when they were arrested?
Yeah, I do.

32:23.874 --> 32:26.016
They were doing some kind
of a big march or something.
So that's, uh...

32:26.116 --> 32:27.377
There were going
to blow up a meeting

32:27.477 --> 32:28.819
of the Model United Nations

32:28.919 --> 32:30.901
with bombs
they made out of

32:31.001 --> 32:32.262
pressure cookers.

32:32.362 --> 32:34.545
Huh. Wait, I'm sorry,
they were going

32:34.645 --> 32:36.507
to blow up the UN?

32:36.607 --> 32:38.348
The Model UN.

32:38.448 --> 32:40.751
As in high schoolers pretending

32:40.851 --> 32:42.933
to be the UN
for extra credit.

32:44.254 --> 32:46.557
Okay. Is that better
or worse?

32:46.657 --> 32:48.679
Because, I mean,
that's not the real UN, right?

32:48.779 --> 32:50.781
It's so much worse. They...

32:51.621 --> 32:53.623
They were going
to kill children

32:54.024 --> 32:56.026
with explosives.

32:59.469 --> 33:01.491
Huh.

33:01.591 --> 33:03.593
Yikes.
Yeah.

33:03.994 --> 33:05.495
Anything comes up. Yeah...

33:05.595 --> 33:07.738
You should keep that.
I don't need that.

33:07.838 --> 33:09.019
Maybe they didn't
kill Gabriel,

33:09.119 --> 33:11.461
but watch
your back, Charlie.

33:11.561 --> 33:13.924
Those two women
are extremely dangerous.

33:31.501 --> 33:33.443
That was intense.

33:33.543 --> 33:35.005
I felt like I was in
"Wolf of Wall Street"

33:35.105 --> 33:37.107
all of a sudden
and not the fun parts.

33:37.868 --> 33:39.409
Are you a rat, Charlie?

33:39.509 --> 33:41.171
Eh?

33:41.271 --> 33:43.653
They grilled us
for an hour.

33:43.753 --> 33:45.755
And you know
we hate pigs.

33:46.596 --> 33:47.818
And rats.

33:50.280 --> 33:51.902
Hey, hey, hey.

33:52.002 --> 33:55.025
I hate pigs and rats, too.

33:55.125 --> 33:57.027
And snakes.

33:57.127 --> 34:00.530
Half the Chinese zodiac
is no good in my book.

34:03.053 --> 34:05.956
Hey, guys, it's me, okay.
It's Charlie.

34:06.056 --> 34:08.118
I didn't know the guy was
a fed until we started talking.

34:08.218 --> 34:10.160
He just sprung it on me.

34:10.260 --> 34:12.262
I'm no stoolie.

34:12.742 --> 34:14.324
If I had known
who Ben was,

34:14.424 --> 34:15.725
I would have steered clear.

34:15.825 --> 34:17.527
Wait, why didn't you
just tell me,

34:17.627 --> 34:19.529
you know, that,
that Ben was Gabriel?

34:19.629 --> 34:21.631
How do you think
we feel?

34:22.672 --> 34:24.774
Knocks on our door
the other night, says,

34:24.874 --> 34:27.957
hey, I'm alive,
and I betrayed you both.

34:29.519 --> 34:32.062
Geez. How'd that go?

34:32.162 --> 34:34.164
We told him
we forgave him.

34:35.605 --> 34:37.707
Hah. Good.

34:37.807 --> 34:40.750
Forgiveness. Alright.

34:40.850 --> 34:43.994
Oh, uh, I did want to ask
you guys about this,

34:44.094 --> 34:46.436
this crazy thing,
it's probably nothing.

34:46.536 --> 34:48.758
So apparently,
you guys were going to,

34:48.858 --> 34:50.200
I don't know,
blow up some kind of

34:50.300 --> 34:54.003
United Nations
for babies or something.

34:54.103 --> 34:56.166
Charlie, what you have
to understand

34:56.266 --> 34:57.927
about these elite
prep school kids,

34:58.027 --> 34:59.369
they were the offspring

34:59.469 --> 35:02.092
of the reigning fascists
of the day.

35:02.192 --> 35:04.134
And we wanted
to send a message

35:04.234 --> 35:08.438
to the next generation
of war criminals.

35:10.520 --> 35:12.502
I see.

35:12.602 --> 35:14.704
Just to be
crystal clear here,

35:14.804 --> 35:17.767
so, uh...
we're talking about...

35:18.888 --> 35:20.550
blowing up
high school kids?

35:20.650 --> 35:22.652
Like, with bombs?

35:23.573 --> 35:25.595
It was a different time.

35:35.545 --> 35:37.547
Uh-huh.

35:37.947 --> 35:39.949
Alright.

35:40.390 --> 35:41.931
I got to say,
I really feel like

35:42.031 --> 35:43.733
we glossed over
some details here.

35:43.833 --> 35:46.376
You know
who you're beginning

35:46.476 --> 35:48.478
to sound a lot like?

35:51.401 --> 35:53.403
Betty.
Betty.

35:54.444 --> 35:56.466
Right.

35:56.566 --> 35:58.187
I got to say, you know,

35:58.287 --> 36:00.790
you're starting to sound
a lot less like Hoffman

36:00.890 --> 36:02.892
and a lot more
like Manson, so...

36:03.693 --> 36:05.675
Oh shit.

36:05.775 --> 36:07.777
Wait, uh,

36:08.097 --> 36:10.099
did you guys...

36:11.461 --> 36:13.463
Did you kill Ben?

36:14.584 --> 36:16.586
You wearing
a wire, Charlie?

36:16.906 --> 36:18.167
Hmm?

36:18.267 --> 36:21.050
Hey, Agent Fuckface.
Go suck an egg.

36:21.150 --> 36:22.892
Alright, man,
stop talking to my tits.

36:22.992 --> 36:24.854
You know what? I...

36:24.954 --> 36:27.056
Fuck! I just--
I really thought
you guys were, like,

36:27.156 --> 36:29.138
these two super-cool women.

36:29.238 --> 36:31.220
You know,
all this talk about

36:31.320 --> 36:32.782
standing up for what
you believe in

36:32.882 --> 36:35.164
and holding
the assholes accountable...

36:44.574 --> 36:46.576
Oh wow.

36:48.497 --> 36:50.480
You're the assholes.

36:50.580 --> 36:52.582
Got it.

37:08.077 --> 37:10.119
You thinkin'
what I'm thinkin'?

37:12.121 --> 37:14.123
Yeah.

37:17.286 --> 37:18.908
Fletcher 1:
Is that a Skarsgard?

37:19.008 --> 37:20.790
Fletcher 2: You think
everyone is a Skarsgard.

37:20.890 --> 37:23.633
Well, everyone is
a Skarsgard.

37:23.733 --> 37:26.676
Hey, hey, you guys watch
a lot of murder shows, right?

37:26.776 --> 37:27.917
Shh!

37:28.017 --> 37:29.598
I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry.

37:29.698 --> 37:32.481
Uh, I was just
wondering, um,

37:32.581 --> 37:35.805
do you know of any
easily accessible poisons

37:35.905 --> 37:38.828
that would trigger
an undetectable heart attack?

37:40.389 --> 37:41.851
Potassium chloride.

37:41.951 --> 37:45.895
Standard go-to,
third season
"Lillyflay Manor."

37:45.995 --> 37:47.376
Calcium chloride.

37:47.476 --> 37:48.818
Epinephrine.

37:48.918 --> 37:50.299
Sodium nitrate.

37:50.399 --> 37:52.141
Common gardening ingredient.

37:52.241 --> 37:55.504
Of course,
it's hard to top

37:55.604 --> 37:56.826
ricin.

37:56.926 --> 37:58.868
All Fletchers:
Ooh, ricin.

37:58.968 --> 38:00.669
Eh, what about the,
the gardening one?

38:00.769 --> 38:02.071
Oh sure.

38:02.171 --> 38:04.673
Couple of cc's
of sodium nitrate

38:04.773 --> 38:06.836
and you're deader
than dirt.

38:06.936 --> 38:08.637
And the best thing is

38:08.737 --> 38:11.801
it's a naturally occurring
compound in the body.

38:11.901 --> 38:14.403
Trying to find that
in an autopsy,

38:14.503 --> 38:16.565
forget about it.

38:16.665 --> 38:18.667
Right on. Gardening.

38:22.191 --> 38:24.193
Okay. Okay.
As you were.

38:25.434 --> 38:27.616
Uh-huh.

38:27.716 --> 38:29.718
Uh-huh.

38:30.119 --> 38:31.340
Sodium nitrate.

38:31.440 --> 38:32.381
Oh.

38:32.481 --> 38:33.822
Yeah, I guess so.

38:33.922 --> 38:35.704
If that's what she, uh,

38:35.804 --> 38:37.907
uses for her
ganja situation.

38:38.007 --> 38:39.909
Man, what's she
been doing with it?

38:40.009 --> 38:41.470
I gave her a week's worth
on Monday,

38:41.570 --> 38:43.192
then another week's worth
on Wednesday.

38:43.292 --> 38:45.474
You tell her
don't shoot that stuff.

38:45.574 --> 38:47.576
It'll mess you up.

38:51.620 --> 38:53.442
Fake nephew.
Charlie. Hey.

38:53.542 --> 38:55.124
So, listen, if I, uh,

38:55.224 --> 38:56.925
if I had some information

38:57.025 --> 38:59.648
about Ben's death,
is that something,

38:59.748 --> 39:02.411
like, could you keep my name
out of the whole business?

39:02.511 --> 39:05.374
Yes, that's what I--
my job is literally
witness protection.

39:05.474 --> 39:07.456
It turns out that
Joyce had access

39:07.556 --> 39:10.179
to some sodium nitrate
the day before Ben was killed.

39:10.279 --> 39:12.341
(over phone) Oh.
Your last guy got whacked?

39:12.441 --> 39:13.582
What is that? Am I, uh...

39:13.682 --> 39:15.104
Sorry, am I
on speakerphone?

39:15.204 --> 39:16.865
Yes. No,
that's Gino the Bull.

39:16.965 --> 39:18.947
It probably
wasn't even murder.

39:19.047 --> 39:20.909
Probably?
Marone...

39:21.009 --> 39:22.711
this ain't inspiring

39:22.811 --> 39:24.513
a lot of confidence,
you know.

39:24.613 --> 39:25.994
Charlie, how could
they have killed him

39:26.094 --> 39:27.356
with sodium nitrate?

39:27.456 --> 39:28.917
Time of death was 2:23.

39:29.017 --> 39:30.759
They were at the zoo
with you.

39:33.662 --> 39:34.883
2:23.

39:34.983 --> 39:36.525
Two-two-three.
Whoa!

39:36.625 --> 39:38.607
Whoa, dude, dude,
that's the time of the monkey.

39:38.707 --> 39:40.088
What of the what?

39:40.188 --> 39:42.331
Oh, th-th-th-the monkey
at the zoo.

39:42.431 --> 39:44.333
The show, you know,
it tells time.

39:44.433 --> 39:46.495
Melanie. Melanie.
She's amazing.

39:46.595 --> 39:47.816
And when I saw this show,

39:47.916 --> 39:49.658
the time the monkey told
was 2:23.

39:49.758 --> 39:51.500
That's a weird coincidence, huh?

39:51.600 --> 39:53.262
Uh, I mean,

39:53.362 --> 39:55.384
do you think
that maybe she's, uh...

39:55.484 --> 39:57.346
you think she's some
kind of a monkey pre-cog?

39:57.446 --> 40:00.909
Pre-cog.
Like "Minority Report"
with monkeys?

40:01.009 --> 40:02.591
No, I do not.

40:02.691 --> 40:04.273
I would watch
that movie, though.

40:04.373 --> 40:05.794
Wait, wait, wait. No.

40:05.894 --> 40:07.836
So, Joyce and Irene,
they skipped the show.

40:07.936 --> 40:09.478
Fuck, yes,
they could have...

40:09.578 --> 40:11.880
Ah shit, no, it's not
enough time for the drive,

40:11.980 --> 40:15.324
but maybe they faked
the time of death.

40:15.424 --> 40:17.606
Charlie, remember
what I said about those two?

40:17.706 --> 40:18.807
Be careful with those two--
Yeah. Hey, Billy!

40:18.907 --> 40:19.968
Let me call you back, okay.

40:20.068 --> 40:22.331
Billy.
Hey, how you been?

40:22.431 --> 40:25.294
I was wondering,
could I get a quick peek

40:25.394 --> 40:28.176
at the data from Ben's
robo-arm-bracelet?

40:28.276 --> 40:30.659
No, absolutely not.
That'd be a HIPAA violation.

40:30.759 --> 40:33.382
Oh yeah, and I'm hip-a
to what you're saying.

40:33.482 --> 40:36.284
But, uh, maybe
just this once.

40:36.885 --> 40:38.547
Okay.

40:38.647 --> 40:40.068
I shouldn't be
doing this, but okay.
Thank you.

40:40.168 --> 40:41.590
Look, you can see
the whole story.

40:41.690 --> 40:43.712
He had a cardiac spike
at 2:23,

40:43.812 --> 40:45.153
and then
the vitals just stopped.

40:45.253 --> 40:46.274
And after that,
we tried to defib him,

40:46.374 --> 40:47.916
but he was already gone.

40:48.016 --> 40:50.639
Let me ask you something,
is it possible to, uh,

40:50.739 --> 40:52.401
I don't know,
fake this?

40:52.501 --> 40:54.403
Like, could you go in
and change it?

40:54.503 --> 40:56.505
No, no, it's hard data. Huh.

40:58.226 --> 41:00.248
What's this,
this blip at 11:10?

41:00.348 --> 41:02.691
Maybe he was startled.
No, but look.

41:02.791 --> 41:05.854
I mean, the heartbeat,
it changes.

41:05.954 --> 41:09.177
I mean, it's a different
speed, strength.

41:09.277 --> 41:11.620
It's almost like he
switched hearts or something.

41:11.720 --> 41:13.141
That is weird.

41:13.241 --> 41:14.623
11:10

41:14.723 --> 41:16.625
That's right around
when we were leaving

41:16.725 --> 41:18.727
for the zoo.

41:19.447 --> 41:21.449
Ah...

41:23.091 --> 41:25.153
She bullshitted
about shitting.

41:25.253 --> 41:27.836
Alright, Luca, are you ready
for some grade-A figuring?

41:27.936 --> 41:29.998
So she climbed up
the plant ladder,

41:30.098 --> 41:32.440
swapped out the heartcuff,
killed him at 11:10.

41:32.540 --> 41:35.403
Then she climbed back down,
went to the zoo,

41:35.503 --> 41:38.126
and faked the cardiac spike
during the monkey show.

41:38.226 --> 41:40.328
Bing-bang-boom.
Bing-bada-boom.

41:40.428 --> 41:42.691
It's nuts.
But plausible.

41:42.791 --> 41:44.292
Plausible's not grounds
for an arrest warrant.

41:44.392 --> 41:47.015
I need something
hard and firm

41:47.115 --> 41:48.376
if I'm going
to ride this one.

41:48.476 --> 41:51.099
Now you're speaking
my language.

41:51.199 --> 41:52.580
Also, Charlie,
for this theory to work,

41:52.680 --> 41:54.262
either Joyce or Irene
would have needed

41:54.362 --> 41:55.503
to simulate a heart attack.

41:55.603 --> 41:56.625
I looked at that spike.

41:56.725 --> 41:58.106
That isn't doing
jumping jacks.

41:58.206 --> 41:59.628
That's a real cardiac event.

41:59.728 --> 42:01.730
I don't know
how you fake that.

42:02.130 --> 42:03.832
I gotta get back to you.

42:05.693 --> 42:09.237
Heya, Pete, uh, let me
ask you a question.

42:09.337 --> 42:12.220
Do you know anything
about sexual zapping?

42:14.182 --> 42:16.404
You speak
of electro-play.

42:16.504 --> 42:18.727
Kinky stuff.
Not for the faint of heart.

42:18.827 --> 42:21.589
All you need is a taser
and an open mind.

42:23.791 --> 42:25.013
Ugh.

42:28.556 --> 42:30.058
Hello?
Uh, Betty.

42:30.158 --> 42:31.499
Uh, it's your
old friend Charlie.

42:31.599 --> 42:33.301
Oh. What do you want?

42:33.401 --> 42:35.143
Oh, listen, I think
you might have been right

42:35.243 --> 42:36.704
about, uh, Joyce and Irene.

42:36.804 --> 42:38.346
I told you.

42:38.446 --> 42:40.188
Felons and junkies.
Yeah, yeah, I know.

42:40.288 --> 42:43.431
Listen, I, I need to know
what you saw at the zoo.

42:43.531 --> 42:45.994
You mentioned something
about a sexual zapping.

42:46.094 --> 42:47.475
Well, yes.

42:47.575 --> 42:49.597
I was buying a hat
like a normal person

42:49.697 --> 42:53.341
when I saw Joyce and Irene
looking extra suspicious.

42:54.943 --> 42:57.525
They were in the hothouse
pleasuring each other

42:57.625 --> 42:59.087
with some kind
of electro-dildo.

43:01.109 --> 43:03.731
And the worst of it is
I missed the monkey show,

43:03.831 --> 43:05.773
which was the whole reason
that I organised

43:05.873 --> 43:08.416
the trip in the first place.

43:08.516 --> 43:11.259
Betty, that's it. That's it.
I think we got 'em.

43:11.359 --> 43:13.581
I'm glad somebody
is finally listening.

43:13.681 --> 43:15.583
Like I told Irene
this morning,

43:15.683 --> 43:17.345
"The zoo is no place

43:17.445 --> 43:20.428
to practice your twisted
masochistic fetishes,

43:20.528 --> 43:23.952
and the FBI
will hear about it."

43:24.052 --> 43:26.594
Wait, Betty,
you told Irene all this.

43:26.694 --> 43:28.516
Uh, just an hour ago.

43:29.657 --> 43:30.798
Oh.

43:30.898 --> 43:32.400
Hold on just
a minute, Charlie.

43:32.500 --> 43:35.483
My Instapot is making
funny noises. Hold on.

43:35.583 --> 43:37.565
Pressure cooker.
No, no, Betty.

43:37.665 --> 43:38.886
Betty, you got
to get out of there.

43:38.986 --> 43:40.568
Betty! Betty!

43:40.668 --> 43:41.849
Evacuate!

43:59.046 --> 44:00.348
You're so silly.

44:00.448 --> 44:01.709
Oh God.
Oh, my God.

44:01.809 --> 44:04.071
Ooh, I think we
may be pushing our luck.

44:04.171 --> 44:06.154
You up for a change
of scenery?

44:06.254 --> 44:08.436
Look, you think
they got, uh, senior

44:08.536 --> 44:10.077
living in Bolivia?

44:10.177 --> 44:12.179
Mmm.

44:14.662 --> 44:16.764
Charlie.

44:26.994 --> 44:28.996
How can we help you?

44:29.557 --> 44:31.098
Betty told me everything,

44:31.198 --> 44:32.860
uh, about how
she saw you two

44:32.960 --> 44:36.183
tasing each other
in the hothouse.

44:36.283 --> 44:38.586
That's how you tricked
the nurses into thinking

44:38.686 --> 44:41.229
that Ben was having
a heart attack

44:41.329 --> 44:45.793
uh, when he'd really
been dead for hours.

44:45.893 --> 44:49.317
Pretty clever.
But you missed one detail.

44:49.417 --> 44:51.919
What might that be?

44:52.019 --> 44:56.043
Ben's heart monitor recording
went totally flat

44:56.143 --> 44:58.966
after your tasing stunt

44:59.066 --> 45:01.068
at 2:23.

45:01.869 --> 45:03.871
The time of the monkey.

45:04.712 --> 45:07.615
But the nurses tried
to revive him with
a defibrillator.

45:07.715 --> 45:10.578
If he'd really been wearing
his heartcuff monitor,

45:10.678 --> 45:12.900
it would have registered
those shocks.

45:13.000 --> 45:14.822
Hmm.
Hmm.

45:14.922 --> 45:16.744
Ain't that some shit.
Mm-hmm.

45:18.325 --> 45:19.667
And all this
for a motherfucker

45:19.767 --> 45:21.829
who sent us to prison
for 30 years?

45:21.929 --> 45:24.111
You deserved it then

45:24.211 --> 45:25.913
and you deserve it now.

45:26.013 --> 45:28.976
Wax up your
shuffleboard pucks, ladies.

45:30.618 --> 45:33.961
As soon as I tell
my new FBI buddy

45:34.061 --> 45:36.724
about all this, well...

45:36.824 --> 45:40.327
Yeah, man, you're going
right back to Bedford.

45:40.427 --> 45:44.291
So you haven't told him
all of this yet?

45:48.596 --> 45:50.337
The fuck?

45:50.437 --> 45:52.179
Ah!
Bitch!

45:57.484 --> 45:59.486
Fuck!

46:01.568 --> 46:03.570
Fucking bitch.

46:09.977 --> 46:11.238
Fucking millennial.

46:11.338 --> 46:12.920
I'm a cusper,
you fucking psycho.

46:13.020 --> 46:16.103
And I draw the line
at fighting little old ladies.

46:18.786 --> 46:21.428
That's how we did it
in Bedford, bitch.

46:32.599 --> 46:34.601
What the fuck!

46:36.483 --> 46:40.427
I'll fucking kill you,
you motherfucker.

46:42.729 --> 46:44.832
Ah!

46:44.932 --> 46:47.835
You talc'd me,
you fucking whore.

46:53.020 --> 46:55.022
Charlie grunts)

46:56.583 --> 46:58.785
Get the fucking poison!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:00.667 --> 47:02.169
Keep her held down.

47:02.269 --> 47:03.370
Ah.

47:03.470 --> 47:05.472
Ah. Ah.

47:08.755 --> 47:10.757
Come on, move.

47:13.160 --> 47:14.461
Right there. Yeah.

47:14.561 --> 47:16.263
Oh! Fuck.

47:16.363 --> 47:17.825
Oh no!
Don't you try it.

47:17.925 --> 47:19.626
Don't you fucking try it.

47:19.726 --> 47:21.628
Put it down.
Put it down.

47:21.728 --> 47:23.270
Down!

47:24.731 --> 47:26.733
Oh! Oh!

47:32.819 --> 47:35.422
Uh, I think
we broke her.

47:37.024 --> 47:39.126
Let's get this shit done.

47:39.226 --> 47:41.228
Oh!

47:43.830 --> 47:45.772
Oh shit. Yeah.

47:45.872 --> 47:47.654
Oh, thank God.
Oh, shit.

47:47.754 --> 47:48.775
Oh, fuck.

47:48.875 --> 47:50.877
Stop right there. Stop.

47:53.720 --> 47:55.622
