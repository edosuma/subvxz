WEBVTT

00:00.230 --> 00:03.200
Previously on "Manifest"...
So, your mom
was Buddhist?

00:03.430 --> 00:04.870
When I came back
and she was gone,

00:04.870 --> 00:07.170
I had my own mini
Buddhist memorial rite for her.

00:07.170 --> 00:09.140
I want you to have this.

00:09.140 --> 00:10.510
I have something
for you, too.

00:10.710 --> 00:12.570
Professor Stone.
Simon White.

00:12.570 --> 00:15.240
We're delighted
you're considering us.
I'm glad to be here.

00:15.240 --> 00:17.010
I'll get you all
the information you need today.

00:17.010 --> 00:18.780
Good, 'cause it's
all coming together on our end.

00:18.780 --> 00:20.380
Saanvi: If there's a chance
to cure the Death Date,

00:20.380 --> 00:22.320
I have to figure it out.
Been hoping
you'd reach out.

00:22.320 --> 00:24.920
No, I wouldn't have bothered
you. I just hit a wall.

00:24.920 --> 00:27.360
Can I at least say
I'm sorry?
I loved you.

00:27.360 --> 00:29.890
I think I did it.
DNA has no anomaly.

00:29.890 --> 00:31.290
What the hell is with
all these passengers?

00:31.290 --> 00:33.900
It's a trap.
He lured us here!

00:33.900 --> 00:35.100
Ben!

00:35.100 --> 00:36.670
We will all be miracles

00:36.670 --> 00:39.000
and transcend death
just like you did.

00:40.500 --> 00:42.200
Get her out! Go!

00:42.200 --> 00:43.610
I'm coming back!

00:45.440 --> 00:46.880
TJ found a journal.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.110
He thinks it's about
the Death Date.

00:56.320 --> 00:58.220
TJ!

01:00.160 --> 01:01.720
Aah!

01:03.560 --> 01:05.130
TJ!

01:38.390 --> 01:42.160
Man: Detective Stone.
We found another body.

01:43.570 --> 01:46.170
Nice and easy.
Watch your back.

01:46.170 --> 01:47.240
Up and over.

01:47.240 --> 01:48.770
Here we go.

01:50.340 --> 01:52.510
Male. Pretty tall.

02:03.690 --> 02:05.520
Bowers:
Six lives total so far.

02:05.520 --> 02:08.520
We're working closely with FDNY
to gather more information.

02:08.520 --> 02:11.030
And, yes, we are very much
treating this fire as a crime.

02:11.030 --> 02:12.930
Is it true that
the passengers of Flight 828

02:12.930 --> 02:14.030
were the intended targets?

02:14.030 --> 02:15.500
That's our best guess so far.

02:15.500 --> 02:17.400
Although a number of
the fatalities and injuries

02:17.400 --> 02:19.730
have been non-passengers.
So, who
torched the place?

02:19.730 --> 02:21.300
Detective Stone's firsthand
account indicates

02:21.300 --> 02:23.040
this might have been arson
committed by

02:23.040 --> 02:25.410
a disgruntled member of
the Church of the Believers.

02:25.410 --> 02:27.140
Isaiah McCann.

02:27.140 --> 02:29.880
This has those Xer sons of
bitches written all over it.

02:29.880 --> 02:31.280
Maybe these two
are working with them.

02:31.280 --> 02:35.050
I don't think so.
You seem awfully certain.

02:35.050 --> 02:36.680
The investigation is ongoing.
You know
something we don't?

02:36.680 --> 02:38.890
So keep this information under
wraps until further notice.

02:38.890 --> 02:41.560
Reporter: Suspected arson
is at play.

02:41.560 --> 02:43.390
As you can see behind me,

02:43.390 --> 02:45.230
the community has rallied
together,

02:45.230 --> 02:47.260
bringing flowers,
cards, candles...

02:47.260 --> 02:48.860
Grace: Sweet of you
to stop by, Simon.

02:48.860 --> 02:51.070
It's the least I could do.

02:51.070 --> 02:53.100
I'm sorry.

02:53.100 --> 02:56.200
The phone calls,
news coverage, it's nonstop.

02:56.200 --> 02:57.970
Excuse me. Hello?

02:57.970 --> 03:02.140
We took Cal to my dad's.
It's just too much for him.

03:02.140 --> 03:04.110
Any of us, really.

03:04.110 --> 03:06.150
And as for Olive,
well, it's...

03:06.150 --> 03:08.780
I know TJ was a friend
to all of you.

03:08.780 --> 03:11.550
Everyone on campus
is terribly upset.

03:11.550 --> 03:13.890
Upset?!
That is such bull!

03:13.890 --> 03:15.490
Olive!
No, I'm sorry.

03:15.490 --> 03:17.930
Everyone at that campus
thought TJ was a freak.

03:17.930 --> 03:19.290
Nobody accepted him.

03:19.290 --> 03:21.230
Nobody even knew
anything about him.

03:21.230 --> 03:22.930
And now they're all sad
that he's gone.

03:22.930 --> 03:24.200
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

03:24.200 --> 03:25.900
I-I-I'll just
get out of your hair.

03:25.900 --> 03:27.340
Just gonna
use the bathroom.

03:27.340 --> 03:29.070
Yeah, it's
through the door on the right.

03:38.950 --> 03:41.020
A woman from the Bronx
has found her sister...

03:41.020 --> 03:43.020
Do you really need to be
watching this?
...last seen at the nightclub,

03:43.020 --> 03:45.050
being treated
at Ed Koch Hospital.

03:45.050 --> 03:47.720
It's just search-and-rescue
still going on.

03:47.720 --> 03:49.990
Alright, that woman
just found her sister.

03:49.990 --> 03:52.390
I mean, TJ could have
made it out alive, too.

03:52.390 --> 03:55.160
Recently, the National Fire
Protection Agency

03:55.160 --> 03:57.170
has enacted tough new code

03:57.170 --> 03:59.630
provisions
for fire sprinklers...

04:03.510 --> 04:05.710
Will you please try?
For me?

04:05.710 --> 04:07.510
I'm not hungry.

04:07.510 --> 04:09.540
Olive,
you need to eat.

04:09.540 --> 04:10.750
I'll make you
something else.

04:10.750 --> 04:13.310
Whatever you want.

04:13.310 --> 04:14.980
Hey.

04:14.980 --> 04:16.750
Simon, this is my sister,
Michaela.

04:16.750 --> 04:18.120
Mick, this is my colleague,
Simon.

04:18.120 --> 04:19.350
Michaela: Nice to meet you.

04:19.350 --> 04:21.160
You need anything,
don't hesitate.

04:21.160 --> 04:23.360
I mean it.
I appreciate that.

04:23.360 --> 04:25.730
Um, can I talk to you
in the other room?

04:27.330 --> 04:28.500
Wait.

04:29.630 --> 04:33.640
Did you...find TJ?

04:33.640 --> 04:38.110
Uh, Olive,
let me talk to Aunt Mick.

04:38.110 --> 04:39.770
No.

04:39.770 --> 04:41.240
I have the right to know.

04:41.240 --> 04:43.410
Please. Tell me.

04:53.860 --> 04:55.520
Olive, um...

05:02.730 --> 05:05.230
No.

05:05.230 --> 05:07.300
No.

05:07.300 --> 05:08.940
I'm sorry.

05:08.940 --> 05:11.340
No, no, no, no.

05:11.340 --> 05:13.110
No, no, no.

05:15.810 --> 05:18.910
No, no, no!

05:18.910 --> 05:20.750
It's okay.
It's okay.

05:34.960 --> 05:38.970
Simon: Look, our mission
with Humanity First is simple --

05:38.970 --> 05:42.700
to create a greater,
safer, stronger nation

05:42.700 --> 05:44.470
for us and our children.

05:44.470 --> 05:47.610
The passengers of Flight 828
threaten that mission.

05:47.610 --> 05:51.110
They've robbed banks.
They've been accused of murder.

05:51.110 --> 05:55.880
And rumors of their
inhuman abilities run rampant.

05:55.880 --> 05:58.820
Let us be clear.

05:58.820 --> 06:02.920
These are
185 walking time bombs

06:02.920 --> 06:04.530
working in our hospitals,

06:04.530 --> 06:09.030
our universities,
our police precincts.

06:09.030 --> 06:11.900
Which one of them
will be next to detonate?

06:13.370 --> 06:17.840
We gotta get these bastards
before they get us.

06:17.840 --> 06:19.670
Be in touch.
Very good.

06:22.680 --> 06:24.280
I appreciate
you attending.

06:24.280 --> 06:26.050
I appreciate
you asking.

06:27.750 --> 06:30.250
Listen,
just a heads up.

06:30.250 --> 06:32.420
I wouldn't be surprised
if people in your orbit

06:32.420 --> 06:34.890
start to get interrogated about
that club fire the other night.

06:34.890 --> 06:38.830
I'm on the verge of exposing the
828ers for the threat they are.

06:38.830 --> 06:41.360
Violence would make them
sympathetic.

06:41.360 --> 06:42.460
Why would I do that?

06:42.460 --> 06:44.400
I'm not saying you would.

06:44.400 --> 06:45.600
My sources tell me

06:45.600 --> 06:48.970
it was a rogue member of
the Church of the Believers.

06:48.970 --> 06:50.540
Their leader disappeared,
too.

06:50.540 --> 06:52.370
Probably in hiding.

06:52.370 --> 06:53.880
This is good.

06:53.880 --> 06:55.380
We could use this.

06:55.380 --> 06:58.580
False flag operation
set by 828 sympathizers

06:58.580 --> 06:59.880
to generate support.

06:59.880 --> 07:02.020
Thank you.

07:02.020 --> 07:03.820
You've proven
quite valuable.

07:03.820 --> 07:06.950
Happy to help.

07:06.950 --> 07:09.490
Jared, uh,
one favor to ask.

07:09.490 --> 07:11.630
A-A movement like ours
needs all types,

07:11.630 --> 07:15.160
but we've got some...
impulsive members.

07:15.160 --> 07:17.270
Your pal Billy for one.

07:17.270 --> 07:20.900
He's quite effective at bringing
new people to the movement,

07:20.900 --> 07:23.040
but he tends to act
without thinking.

07:23.040 --> 07:26.670
Hmm.
Which could be detrimental
to our goals.

07:26.670 --> 07:30.010
Please keep an eye on him.

07:33.480 --> 07:35.050
Man: Yeah, if we could
get a bed, please.

07:35.050 --> 07:36.680
You need a bed?

07:36.680 --> 07:39.490
Saanvi. Hey. Saanvi.

07:41.890 --> 07:43.120
Saanvi.
Yeah?

07:43.120 --> 07:44.560
You okay?
Yeah.

07:44.560 --> 07:46.490
I've just been here all night.
What's up?

07:46.490 --> 07:48.300
The last thing I want to do is
take you away from an emergency.

07:48.300 --> 07:49.560
There's no one else
to save.

07:49.560 --> 07:51.370
They suspended
the search-and-rescue.

07:51.370 --> 07:54.740
It's just search-and-recovery
now.

07:54.740 --> 07:55.900
What?

07:55.900 --> 07:57.570
Could I show you
something?

08:01.710 --> 08:03.710
Woman: If you could
just take a seat, please...

08:03.710 --> 08:05.110
Are you in any pain?

08:05.110 --> 08:07.080
Nothing I can't handle.

08:07.080 --> 08:08.750
But it's
not getting better.

08:08.750 --> 08:10.520
It's just like
in the cave.

08:10.520 --> 08:12.620
I think
you might be right.

08:12.620 --> 08:16.120
I may be freezing to death.
Can you help me?

08:16.120 --> 08:18.160
We need to get you to my lab
right now. Let's go.

08:18.160 --> 08:20.930
Sorry, Jared did what?

08:20.930 --> 08:22.560
Defended the Xers.

08:22.560 --> 08:24.130
At least that's
what it sounded like to me.

08:24.130 --> 08:25.370
He was insistent that

08:25.370 --> 08:26.900
they couldn't be
involved in the arson.

08:28.370 --> 08:32.040
What?
I mean, the Xers
didn't start the fire, but...

08:32.040 --> 08:35.240
But...?
I don't know. I...

08:35.240 --> 08:37.480
My gut is telling me that
Jared's involved in something

08:37.480 --> 08:39.250
that could cause
some serious problems.

08:39.250 --> 08:41.850
You think
he's in with the Xers?

08:41.850 --> 08:43.920
Do you?

08:43.920 --> 08:45.520
I hate to say it,
but, yeah, I do.

08:45.520 --> 08:47.760
I-I think he's leaking
police intel to them.

08:47.760 --> 08:50.360
He copied my investigations
and then he lied about it.

08:50.360 --> 08:52.860
Are you kidding me
right now?
That's all I have on him, so I can't...

08:52.860 --> 08:54.830
Let's tail him.

08:54.830 --> 08:56.930
I'm not there yet.

08:56.930 --> 08:58.600
Do you want answers
or not?

09:15.080 --> 09:18.950
She seems okay,
but I don't know.

09:20.450 --> 09:23.120
My laying into her about Adrian
and following the Believers,

09:23.120 --> 09:26.760
I just created
this giant void between us.

09:26.760 --> 09:28.530
But you were right,
Ben.

09:28.530 --> 09:30.500
Everything
you said to her.

09:30.500 --> 09:32.500
Yeah, but it doesn't make it
any better.

09:33.500 --> 09:35.800
I told myself I was
gonna make up for lost time,

09:35.800 --> 09:38.110
but I just pushed her further
and further away from me

09:38.110 --> 09:39.470
since I came back,
Grace.

09:41.340 --> 09:43.210
I don't know what to do.

09:43.210 --> 09:45.980
I think we need
to give her space.

09:45.980 --> 09:47.380
And who knows?

09:47.380 --> 09:49.420
Maybe the time
will be good for both of you.

09:51.150 --> 09:53.820
What do you mean?

09:53.820 --> 09:57.530
Ben, when you came back

09:57.530 --> 10:00.260
and learned
that your mother had died,

10:00.260 --> 10:02.360
you were so focused
on helping all of us

10:02.360 --> 10:04.770
that I don't think you ever
really processed that loss.

10:04.770 --> 10:06.770
This is about Olive.

10:06.770 --> 10:08.400
And she just lost
the first love of her life.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.170
I have to do something
to help her.

10:10.170 --> 10:12.440
You can't protect her
from her pain.

10:14.780 --> 10:17.810
I just can't stop thinking
about that Al-Zuras illustration

10:17.810 --> 10:19.710
of the man carrying the girl
through the fire.

10:19.710 --> 10:21.350
It might as well
have been a picture

10:21.350 --> 10:22.680
of me and Olive
at the nightclub.

10:22.680 --> 10:24.620
I know.
It gives me the chills.

10:24.620 --> 10:27.760
It means something.

10:27.760 --> 10:30.730
It has to.

11:09.400 --> 11:12.130
What the hell
do you want from me?

11:17.510 --> 11:19.770
Mick.
Did you just get that Calling?

11:19.770 --> 11:21.210
No. Why? What was it?

11:21.210 --> 11:24.980
Some sort of chanting, but not
in a language I recognized.

11:24.980 --> 11:26.450
I wish I could help.

11:26.450 --> 11:27.880
The last Calling I had
was about fire.

11:27.880 --> 11:29.520
I didn't figure it out
until it was too late.

11:29.520 --> 11:31.420
People died.
I can't let that happen again.

11:31.420 --> 11:33.920
Okay, well, a lot more people
survived because of you, too.

11:33.920 --> 11:35.760
Look,
hang in there, okay?

11:35.760 --> 11:37.660
I'll -- I'll call you
if I hear anything.

11:37.660 --> 11:38.890
Alright.

11:40.460 --> 11:42.060
Saanvi:
Okay, your MRI looks good.

11:42.060 --> 11:43.730
There's no bone
or muscle damage.

11:43.730 --> 11:46.300
I want to check your blood-cell
count and filtration, okay?

11:46.300 --> 11:47.970
This is all
just a band-aid.

11:47.970 --> 11:49.400
It's not
gonna save my life.

11:49.400 --> 11:52.270
No.
So what will?

11:52.270 --> 11:56.310
Saanvi, I've got six months.
Please.

11:56.310 --> 11:58.880
I've been doing some experiments
on myself.

11:58.880 --> 12:02.080
I've been able to eliminate
the DNA anomaly from my body

12:02.080 --> 12:03.680
with an injectable serum.

12:03.680 --> 12:04.950
And the Callings?

12:04.950 --> 12:07.960
They're gone.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.120
So,
what are we waiting for?

12:09.120 --> 12:10.690
It's still preliminary,
Zeke.

12:10.690 --> 12:12.890
I don't know how long it's gonna
last or if it's even safe.

12:12.890 --> 12:14.760
There could be side effects,
and it could backfire.

12:14.760 --> 12:18.030
It could make me worse.
Worse than dying?

12:18.030 --> 12:20.800
Look,
Michaela and I...

12:20.800 --> 12:24.710
She makes me feel like my life
is finally coming together.

12:24.710 --> 12:27.540
And to lose it all
because of this Death Date...

12:29.840 --> 12:32.250
I'm a sap.

12:32.250 --> 12:34.520
Listen, when you care
for someone that deeply,

12:34.520 --> 12:38.250
I get wanting to hold onto it,
no matter what.

12:38.250 --> 12:40.290
Been there, done that?

12:40.290 --> 12:43.690
I wish
I was still there.

12:43.690 --> 12:45.560
But I lost it.

12:45.560 --> 12:48.230
Saanvi, I don't have
any more time to waste.

12:50.460 --> 12:51.770
Okay.

12:51.770 --> 12:53.770
First, you need to clear
the pre-clinical testing --

12:53.770 --> 12:55.640
kidney function,
liver enzymes, tox screens.

12:55.640 --> 12:57.070
That's just
to name a few.

12:57.070 --> 12:58.940
If you pass that,

12:58.940 --> 13:03.140
and assuming your system
doesn't reject the infusion,

13:03.140 --> 13:06.050
then, yes, you might have a
chance of actually beating this.

13:06.050 --> 13:07.980
Just say when.

13:07.980 --> 13:09.180
When.

13:12.920 --> 13:16.260
It's all my fault.

13:16.260 --> 13:18.330
I made TJ go
to the nightclub.

13:18.330 --> 13:19.730
He didn't even
want to be there.

13:19.730 --> 13:22.400
This was not
your fault, Olive.

13:22.400 --> 13:24.370
It was a horrible tragedy

13:24.370 --> 13:26.930
at the hands of someone
who was seriously disturbed.

13:28.340 --> 13:30.070
Olive.

13:30.070 --> 13:33.340
This drawing -- Every time I see
it, I see you and me.

13:33.340 --> 13:36.240
I just had a Calling when I was
looking at it in the garage.

13:36.240 --> 13:37.680
What did the Calling say?

13:37.680 --> 13:40.210
I don't know.
It was some sort of chanting.

13:40.210 --> 13:42.580
But I think it has something
to do with you and me.

13:42.580 --> 13:43.920
I'm not
a part of the Callings.

13:43.920 --> 13:45.550
I think now you are.

13:45.550 --> 13:47.390
I think we're supposed
to do something together.

13:47.390 --> 13:49.760
Well, it's a little late now,
isn't it?

13:49.760 --> 13:51.360
If some
random, old drawing

13:51.360 --> 13:52.760
suddenly makes me
a part of the Callings,

13:52.760 --> 13:54.400
then why
didn't the drawings

13:54.400 --> 13:57.300
show you carrying me and TJ
out of the fire?

13:57.300 --> 13:59.470
Why didn't
the Callings stop this?

13:59.470 --> 14:01.500
The Callings didn't do this
to TJ, Olive.

14:01.500 --> 14:04.140
Well, it sure didn't save him,
either.

14:06.270 --> 14:10.210
Look, Ol, there's a memorial
site set up at the nightclub.

14:10.210 --> 14:12.710
I could take you. We could both
pay our respects together.

14:12.710 --> 14:14.420
I can't.

14:14.420 --> 14:15.980
Okay? I am not ready.

14:15.980 --> 14:18.690
Alright.

14:18.690 --> 14:20.020
You go.

14:27.160 --> 14:28.400
Where's your brother?

14:28.400 --> 14:30.560
Hey, babe.
Missed you, too.

14:33.530 --> 14:36.800
You good?
Mm-hmm.

14:36.800 --> 14:40.640
Hey, Vasquez,
you want a drink?

14:40.640 --> 14:41.980
We're just, uh, celebrating

14:41.980 --> 14:44.410
a few less 828ers
in the world today.

14:44.410 --> 14:46.150
Can we talk?

14:46.150 --> 14:48.650
Yeah, okay.

14:48.650 --> 14:51.090
So, I just spoke
with Simon.

14:51.090 --> 14:53.920
He doesn't want anyone
going off the rails over this.

14:53.920 --> 14:55.690
He's got a solid plan,
Billy.

14:55.690 --> 14:57.530
He just -- He wants us
to stay on course.

14:57.530 --> 14:59.690
You and Simon are
having private pow-wows now?

14:59.690 --> 15:01.130
I-I was the one
who brought you in on this.

15:01.130 --> 15:03.060
He knows how invaluable you are
to the cause.

15:03.060 --> 15:05.470
He just -- He just wants us
to stay chill right now.

15:05.470 --> 15:08.370
You're getting pretty cozy
pretty fast there, Vasquez.

15:08.370 --> 15:10.870
Moving in on my sister,
up Simon's ass...

15:10.870 --> 15:12.840
Hey! Watch it.

15:12.840 --> 15:14.940
That mouth of yours is gonna
get you in some serious trouble

15:14.940 --> 15:18.110
one of these days.
With who? you?

15:18.110 --> 15:19.380
I'll take you.

15:19.380 --> 15:22.580
Alright, Billy.
Just...stop it.

15:27.860 --> 15:29.790
Jared.

15:29.790 --> 15:32.630
I swear Billy was dropped
on his head as a baby.

15:32.630 --> 15:36.130
It's the only way
to explain how we're related.

15:36.130 --> 15:37.600
You got to watch out.

15:37.600 --> 15:39.900
The kid
can go pretty psycho.

15:39.900 --> 15:42.500
So can I.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.420
This isn't exactly
how I pictured

15:56.420 --> 15:57.750
spending
my Thursday afternoon.

15:57.750 --> 15:59.020
Yeah,
I wouldn't want to watch

15:59.020 --> 16:00.790
my ex kissing someone else,
either.

16:00.790 --> 16:04.120
Yeah, I don't love seeing Jared
making out with another woman,

16:04.120 --> 16:06.430
but...

16:06.430 --> 16:08.330
that's not all
that's bugging me.

16:08.330 --> 16:09.500
What?

16:09.500 --> 16:11.200
This bar --
It's not his vibe.

16:11.200 --> 16:14.030
At least
it didn't used to be.

16:14.030 --> 16:16.540
No, him -- him being here,
it just feels wrong.

16:16.540 --> 16:18.540
There's something going on
in there.

16:20.270 --> 16:21.810
I'm gonna go in.
No. Whoa.

16:21.810 --> 16:24.210
I'm getting a major
"passengers not allowed" vibe

16:24.210 --> 16:25.810
from this place.

16:25.810 --> 16:27.450
You're the last person who
could walk in here incognito.

16:27.450 --> 16:28.820
Okay, fine.
You want to go in?

16:28.820 --> 16:31.690
I thought
you'd never ask.

16:31.690 --> 16:33.990
Get your
Annie Leibovitz on.

16:33.990 --> 16:35.060
This is all me.

17:47.160 --> 17:50.500
Okay. I'll bite.

18:03.680 --> 18:07.450
Hey. Uh, IPA.
Something local?

18:07.450 --> 18:09.080
Gotcha.

18:12.550 --> 18:15.090
Nice suit.
Yeah. Thanks.

18:15.090 --> 18:17.790
Almost makes up for constantly
living out of a suitcase

18:17.790 --> 18:19.260
and dealing
with flight delays.

18:19.260 --> 18:22.000
Mm.
LaGuardia?

18:22.000 --> 18:23.260
The worst.

18:23.260 --> 18:25.230
I was gonna bide my time
rolling e-mails,

18:25.230 --> 18:27.900
but then I saw this cool chick
kissing Prince Charming

18:27.900 --> 18:30.040
outside a bar and figured,

18:30.040 --> 18:32.510
"Maybe my future husband's
laying in wait."

18:32.510 --> 18:34.170
Sorry to report my boyfriend

18:34.170 --> 18:36.140
isn't exactly
your typical customer in here.

18:36.140 --> 18:38.350
Afraid you're stuck
with my brother

18:38.350 --> 18:41.680
and his bonehead friends.

18:41.680 --> 18:44.050
Beats the Delta lounge.

18:45.920 --> 18:48.820
Hey.
Who wants to lose 20 bucks?

18:48.820 --> 18:52.630
I think you mean
who wants to win $50?

18:57.060 --> 18:58.630
Rack 'em.

19:15.220 --> 19:17.180
Excuse me.

19:17.180 --> 19:19.090
Do you hear anything?

19:19.090 --> 19:21.590
Just the heater.
It's always clicking like that.

20:00.330 --> 20:02.630
You always make profits on,
your, uh, stakeouts?

20:02.630 --> 20:04.600
I won this money fair
and square.

20:04.600 --> 20:06.200
Not even gonna ask.

20:06.200 --> 20:08.870
So, Jared's new flame's
the bartender.

20:08.870 --> 20:10.670
She may be an Xer
because her brother

20:10.670 --> 20:12.440
and the jackasses
he hangs out with

20:12.440 --> 20:13.870
sure as hell are.

20:13.870 --> 20:15.110
Jared seems to be close
with all of them,

20:15.110 --> 20:17.140
but especially the brother,
Billy.

20:17.140 --> 20:19.750
Why, Jared?

20:19.750 --> 20:21.450
I don't know.

20:21.450 --> 20:23.450
But let's run those pics
through the database,

20:23.450 --> 20:25.720
see if we can make a case
out of any of them.

20:27.490 --> 20:28.890
Anything else?

20:28.890 --> 20:30.120
You're not gonna
want to hear this,

20:30.120 --> 20:33.290
but the bartender
smells good.

20:33.290 --> 20:34.600
I'm getting a new partner.

20:34.600 --> 20:36.230
I'm sorry. You love me.

20:36.230 --> 20:37.300
No, I don't.

20:38.770 --> 20:41.070
My heart.

20:41.070 --> 20:44.870
It just feels like
someone's...

20:44.870 --> 20:46.310
punching it out.

20:46.310 --> 20:50.980
None of this makes sense.
It just...

20:50.980 --> 20:53.180
I don't know
how to make it stop.

20:53.180 --> 20:54.820
I think I might.

20:54.820 --> 20:56.450
I think the Calling
wants to help us heal.

20:56.450 --> 20:57.550
No, Dad, I already --

20:57.550 --> 20:59.550
No, no, no, no.
Just listen.

20:59.550 --> 21:01.120
I had
the chanting Calling again,

21:01.120 --> 21:04.690
and it led me from the memorial
site to this Zen Center.

21:07.690 --> 21:09.830
Wait.

21:09.830 --> 21:12.500
You went to a Zen Center?

21:12.500 --> 21:15.340
Like, for Buddhists?
Exactly.

21:15.340 --> 21:18.140
The place was empty,
but the chanting -- it was...

21:19.910 --> 21:21.840
I don't know
how to put it.

21:24.210 --> 21:25.780
Enveloping me.

21:25.780 --> 21:29.050
TJ's mom was a Buddhist.

21:29.050 --> 21:31.590
The bracelet he gave you.

21:33.990 --> 21:39.130
When he came back
and he learned she was gone,

21:39.130 --> 21:44.630
he did his own
DIY Buddhist ceremony for her,

21:44.630 --> 21:46.800
to say goodbye.

21:46.800 --> 21:49.700
Maybe we're
supposed to do that for TJ.

21:49.700 --> 21:52.270
You know,
to have some sort of...

21:52.270 --> 21:54.910
spiritual closure.

21:54.910 --> 21:57.380
It's just like
the Al-Zuras drawing.

21:57.380 --> 21:59.610
You carried her
through the flames.

21:59.610 --> 22:02.580
Maybe the Calling
wants you to...

22:02.580 --> 22:05.990
carry her through her grief?

22:05.990 --> 22:10.590
Carry each other.

22:10.590 --> 22:14.330
What do you think?

22:14.330 --> 22:18.170
I couldn't care less
what the Callings want.

22:21.840 --> 22:25.310
But TJ --

22:25.310 --> 22:27.510
He would have
really liked that.

22:48.360 --> 22:49.430
Hey.

23:10.880 --> 23:12.620
Do you still hear it?

23:12.620 --> 23:14.490
The chanting?

23:16.460 --> 23:21.760
TJ used beads like those when
he did the ceremony for his mom.

23:21.760 --> 23:23.460
Well, good.

23:23.460 --> 23:25.570
I'll follow your lead.

23:34.780 --> 23:36.340
I don't know what to do.

23:36.340 --> 23:38.910
I don't know
the right mantra.

23:38.910 --> 23:41.880
We can make up our own.
You and me.

23:41.880 --> 23:43.480
DIY, right?

23:47.420 --> 23:48.460
Come on.

23:56.630 --> 23:59.900
Exactly how many beers did
you consume on that mission?

23:59.900 --> 24:01.500
Exactly one.

24:01.500 --> 24:04.300
Might just want to pop
a little breath mint.

24:06.940 --> 24:08.540
We have a hit.

24:08.540 --> 24:11.240
Oh, hello, dirt bag.

24:11.240 --> 24:14.250
Stints for assault,
drunk and disorderly...

24:14.250 --> 24:18.290
And, wait for it,
a recent charge for vandalism.

24:18.290 --> 24:22.220
Arrest report notes
anti-828 graffiti.

24:22.220 --> 24:25.790
Jared's bestie is officially
a criminal and an Xer.

24:25.790 --> 24:27.230
He really is
one of them.

24:27.230 --> 24:30.530
Jared?
Are you surprised?

24:30.530 --> 24:32.600
I mean, now the haircut
makes sense.

24:34.900 --> 24:37.800
Hey, you okay?

24:37.800 --> 24:39.910
No, not really.

24:41.940 --> 24:44.980
I-I can't help but feel
like I did this to him.

24:44.980 --> 24:47.810
What, made Jared
a bigoted hate-monger? No.

24:47.810 --> 24:50.350
He did that
all by himself.

24:50.350 --> 24:53.020
This isn't the guy
that I was gonna marry.

24:54.290 --> 24:57.720
Something's wrong here.
Something seems not right here.

24:57.720 --> 25:00.630
People change.

25:00.630 --> 25:03.600
But are you with me on this?
Now what?

25:03.600 --> 25:05.070
Just knowing
they're in a hate group

25:05.070 --> 25:07.630
doesn't give us
cause to move.

25:07.630 --> 25:10.270
Not yet.

25:10.270 --> 25:12.010
But the Xers are gonna do
something.

25:12.010 --> 25:13.540
Jared stole my case files,

25:13.540 --> 25:16.740
and that can unravel
a lot of lives.

25:16.740 --> 25:19.010
So, how are we
gonna figure it out, Supercop?

25:28.090 --> 25:30.960
This is Detective Stone
for Judge Trilling.

25:30.960 --> 25:33.360
The judge
who released Zeke?

25:35.100 --> 25:37.560
Your Honor, I...

25:37.560 --> 25:40.600
Yeah, hi. It's me.

25:40.600 --> 25:43.870
Judge, I need a favor.

25:58.050 --> 26:00.550
Now what?

26:02.620 --> 26:07.790
Well, how about we think
of each bead as a memory of TJ?

26:07.790 --> 26:11.600
And we can share it
with each other and with him?

26:13.600 --> 26:15.570
Out loud?

26:15.570 --> 26:18.000
Too hokey?

26:18.000 --> 26:19.910
No.

26:24.580 --> 26:29.420
When I first saw you
in my dad's office,

26:29.420 --> 26:32.220
I could --

26:32.220 --> 26:36.120
I could barely breathe.

26:36.120 --> 26:39.030
I was too embarrassed
to admit

26:39.030 --> 26:43.760
that I remembered you
from Jamaica

26:43.760 --> 26:47.170
and that I had...

26:47.170 --> 26:50.600
the biggest crush on you
ever since.

26:50.600 --> 26:53.670
Your kindness

26:53.670 --> 26:57.210
and your sweet smile

26:57.210 --> 27:00.980
and your heart, it...

27:00.980 --> 27:06.050
it stayed with me
for 5 1/2 years.

27:27.440 --> 27:32.410
First day of school,
my tryout,

27:32.410 --> 27:34.850
you not only
came to support me,

27:34.850 --> 27:38.050
but you gave me
that lifeline in class.

27:38.050 --> 27:40.750
That was --

27:40.750 --> 27:43.260
That was really cool.

27:43.260 --> 27:46.830
All of a sudden,
you weren't a student

27:46.830 --> 27:48.860
or just an 828 passenger.

27:48.860 --> 27:51.100
You were...

27:53.870 --> 27:55.670
...my friend.

28:04.240 --> 28:08.010
You always talked
about how...

28:10.420 --> 28:13.690
...your mom taught you

28:13.690 --> 28:16.560
to stay true to yourself

28:16.560 --> 28:19.590
and follow
the path of enlightenment.

28:22.230 --> 28:25.700
I hope you found your path, TJ.

28:28.440 --> 28:31.070
I'll keep looking for mine.

28:57.960 --> 29:00.400
Wow.

29:00.400 --> 29:02.970
Good.
Well, you know who I am.

29:02.970 --> 29:05.510
I know who you are, so that
saves us the introductions.

29:05.510 --> 29:07.240
You've either got
big brass ones

29:07.240 --> 29:08.980
or you've just wandered
into the last place

29:08.980 --> 29:11.380
you want to wander into.
I'm gonna go with
that first option,

29:11.380 --> 29:13.750
seeing as I definitely
meant to show up here.

29:13.750 --> 29:15.850
I actually came
to talk to you.

29:15.850 --> 29:17.980
If the idea is to
talk me out of seeing Jared,

29:17.980 --> 29:19.550
I'll tell you right now
you're wasting your time.

29:19.550 --> 29:23.090
No, I actually
came to help Jared.

29:23.090 --> 29:24.820
Maybe help you, too.

29:24.820 --> 29:27.060
Who says we need help?

29:27.060 --> 29:29.860
Well, I know that Jared
is a part of an anti-828 group,

29:29.860 --> 29:31.230
and I know
that your brother is, too.

29:31.230 --> 29:32.730
You got issues
with Jared or Billy,

29:32.730 --> 29:35.500
you should be talking
to them.
NYPD will be.

29:35.500 --> 29:38.070
Soon.

29:38.070 --> 29:39.570
That nightclub fire

29:39.570 --> 29:43.280
triggered a zero-tolerance
policy on anti-828 violence.

29:43.280 --> 29:46.250
I know there's more coming
and that Jared is a part of it,

29:46.250 --> 29:48.310
so that gives me
two choices.

29:48.310 --> 29:49.850
Either you're a part
of this group

29:49.850 --> 29:52.420
and you get busted
along with him...

29:54.290 --> 29:55.790
...or you're actually
a good person

29:55.790 --> 29:58.730
who's just in
way over their head.

29:58.730 --> 30:00.360
And if you
care about Jared,

30:00.360 --> 30:01.860
then you'll help extricate him
from this mess.

30:01.860 --> 30:06.000
Look, I know your brother --
He's a lost cause, but...

30:06.000 --> 30:07.730
Jared's not.

30:14.270 --> 30:18.240
Maybe you think
you still know who Jared is.

30:18.240 --> 30:19.980
But you don't.

30:25.550 --> 30:28.320
Yeah.

30:28.320 --> 30:30.760
Maybe you're right.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.970
You need to get back here.

30:53.780 --> 30:55.580
Thank you.

30:57.320 --> 30:59.750
You don't have to thank me
for anything.

30:59.750 --> 31:03.390
This was
for the both of us.

31:03.390 --> 31:06.530
Even after
how hard I've been,

31:06.530 --> 31:08.930
you've never stopped
looking out for me.

31:13.300 --> 31:15.700
And I never will.

31:30.250 --> 31:32.650
You hear it again?

31:32.650 --> 31:34.820
Did we not do
what it wanted?

31:34.820 --> 31:36.960
Maybe not.
Maybe there's more.

31:36.960 --> 31:38.690
Where is it coming from?

31:38.690 --> 31:40.790
I don't know.
Everywhere.

31:40.790 --> 31:43.200
Are you sure?

31:43.200 --> 31:44.460
Maybe it wants you
to follow it.

31:44.460 --> 31:45.830
I followed it here.

31:45.830 --> 31:49.900
Right, but maybe this
isn't the final destination.

31:49.900 --> 31:51.200
Concentrate.

32:06.850 --> 32:08.490
Come on.

32:17.200 --> 32:19.500
Stay here.
What? No way!

32:29.380 --> 32:30.440
Anything?

32:30.440 --> 32:32.880
The chanting.
It's louder.

32:39.750 --> 32:42.220
What?
Is it on the other side?

32:42.220 --> 32:43.520
Yeah, I think it is.

32:43.520 --> 32:45.590
Aren't we underground?

32:45.590 --> 32:47.660
I know.
I don't get it.

32:49.360 --> 32:52.770
Over here!
There's a door!

33:29.440 --> 33:31.000
What is it?

33:31.000 --> 33:33.970
I don't know.
But it's louder now.

33:33.970 --> 33:36.440
Woman: Hello?
Shh. Shh. Shh.

33:36.440 --> 33:37.740
Is somebody down there?

33:37.740 --> 33:39.580
Hey.

33:39.580 --> 33:42.480
I think
we have to do this...

33:42.480 --> 33:43.950
together.

33:46.590 --> 33:48.220
Let's do it.

34:04.300 --> 34:06.210
What is this?

34:06.210 --> 34:07.570
Some kind of subway track?

34:07.570 --> 34:09.410
Ah, too narrow.

34:09.410 --> 34:12.350
Maybe part of
an old coal transport

34:12.350 --> 34:14.750
or some sort of
prohibition smugglers' tunnel.

34:16.550 --> 34:17.920
You still hear it?

34:17.920 --> 34:20.090
Yeah, so much so
my eardrums might explode.

34:24.420 --> 34:30.600
I understand chanting in a Zen
Center, but down here? Why?

34:30.600 --> 34:32.400
I don't know.

34:32.400 --> 34:34.670
Your guess
is as good as mine.

34:36.300 --> 34:37.300
This way.

34:55.620 --> 34:57.690
What the hell?

34:57.690 --> 35:02.430
Hey.
You want to go back?

35:02.430 --> 35:03.960
Hell, no.

35:03.960 --> 35:05.600
Billy: I told you
he was gonna be trouble.

35:05.600 --> 35:07.670
Tamara: Forget Jared.
He and I have our own thing.

35:07.670 --> 35:09.140
It's his ex
who's your problem.

35:09.140 --> 35:11.640
My problem?
It's his problem.

35:11.640 --> 35:13.110
Vasquez better shut
that 828 freak up,

35:13.110 --> 35:14.440
or he's the one
who goes down.

35:15.810 --> 35:18.310
They go on and on,
but there's your proof.

35:18.310 --> 35:19.850
Definitely incriminating.

35:19.850 --> 35:21.480
None of it's admissible.

35:21.480 --> 35:25.120
I don't have to tell you that
an illegal tap is a felony.

35:25.120 --> 35:28.020
Surveillance warrant,
courtesy of Judge Trilling.

35:28.020 --> 35:29.660
We've got Vasquez,
captain.

35:29.660 --> 35:31.390
He's the leak
who blew the Xer bust.

35:31.390 --> 35:34.390
And he copied Stone's files
and gave them to God knows who.

35:34.390 --> 35:36.300
This is a serious accusation.

35:36.300 --> 35:39.000
I know you think it's always too
personal between me and Vasquez,

35:39.000 --> 35:41.370
but that's the problem --
he made it personal.

35:41.370 --> 35:44.000
I'll take it from here.

35:59.920 --> 36:01.950
There's stuff in the air.

36:01.950 --> 36:04.620
I can feel it
in my throat.

36:04.620 --> 36:05.960
It's ash.

36:05.960 --> 36:07.330
The nightclub's
just a few blocks away.

36:07.330 --> 36:10.830
I bet this path
is leading right towards it.

36:10.830 --> 36:12.570
The chanting,
it's just...

36:14.670 --> 36:16.440
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

36:16.440 --> 36:18.570
It went away.

36:18.570 --> 36:20.270
Are you sure?

36:20.270 --> 36:21.370
No, I'm positive.

36:21.370 --> 36:23.580
It -- Just all of a sudden,
it just...

36:23.580 --> 36:25.180
Young Man: Hello?

36:25.180 --> 36:26.680
Help.

36:26.680 --> 36:28.580
Anybody?

36:28.580 --> 36:29.820
Anybody, please.

36:29.820 --> 36:32.390
-TJ!
-Olive! Here!

36:32.390 --> 36:33.720
I'm here! Olive!

36:33.720 --> 36:36.260
TJ! TJ!

36:38.260 --> 36:40.560
TJ!
TJ!

36:44.260 --> 36:45.400
TJ!

36:45.400 --> 36:47.970
Help, please!

36:47.970 --> 36:50.600
TJ!

36:50.600 --> 36:52.310
Olive?
TJ!

36:52.310 --> 36:53.410
Olive, I'm here!

36:57.340 --> 36:58.610
Oh, my God.

36:58.610 --> 37:00.450
You're alive.

37:00.450 --> 37:02.050
Take it -- Take it easy.

37:03.780 --> 37:05.590
How is this happening?

37:08.120 --> 37:10.060
We're gonna
get you out of here.

37:13.560 --> 37:16.000
Dr. Soltani:
Six broken ribs.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.930
His punctured lung created
severe internal bleeding,

37:17.930 --> 37:19.970
plus extreme dehydration.

37:19.970 --> 37:21.730
I doubt he would have made it
another few hours.

37:21.730 --> 37:23.870
It's a miracle, really.

37:23.870 --> 37:25.740
He's a lucky young man.

37:25.740 --> 37:28.040
Thank you.

37:31.640 --> 37:33.410
We should call mom.

37:33.410 --> 37:36.380
We should call everyone.

37:36.380 --> 37:39.320
I don't get it.

37:39.320 --> 37:41.550
How?

37:41.550 --> 37:44.060
Aunt Mick
found my bracelet.

37:44.060 --> 37:46.560
I have
absolutely no idea.

37:46.560 --> 37:50.260
Isaiah.

37:50.260 --> 37:52.570
Shh. Shh.

37:52.570 --> 37:54.400
You need to get rest.

37:54.400 --> 37:56.370
I pulled away from him,

37:56.370 --> 37:58.700
and he was holding onto
the bracelet.

37:58.700 --> 38:00.640
Isaiah.

38:00.640 --> 38:02.380
It was Isaiah's body
that they found.

38:02.380 --> 38:06.480
TJ, how did you find your way
underneath that building,

38:06.480 --> 38:07.510
with all that smoke?

38:07.510 --> 38:09.550
I-I couldn't see a thing.

38:09.550 --> 38:12.350
I heard...

38:12.350 --> 38:15.620
voices.

38:15.620 --> 38:17.220
Chanting.

38:18.960 --> 38:21.790
You found your path
to enlightenment.

38:40.350 --> 38:42.720
Wow. Good news travels
seriously fast.

38:42.720 --> 38:46.350
I heard it over the scanner.
How?
How do you think?

38:48.220 --> 38:50.320
That's one hell
of a Calling.

38:50.320 --> 38:52.690
It's a...

38:52.690 --> 38:54.590
really long story.

38:54.590 --> 38:55.930
Mom was right.

38:55.930 --> 38:58.730
All things do work together
for good.

38:58.730 --> 39:01.800
TJ surviving,
us following the Callings,

39:01.800 --> 39:05.300
it's --
it's teaching us something.

39:05.300 --> 39:07.270
When you figure out
what that is,

39:07.270 --> 39:09.180
why don't you send me
the CliffsNotes?

39:30.000 --> 39:32.160
Billy: My problem?
It's his problem.

39:32.160 --> 39:33.870
Vasquez better
shut that 828 freak up,

39:33.870 --> 39:35.740
or he's the one
who goes down.

39:38.870 --> 39:42.240
Bowers:
We've got a problem.

39:50.020 --> 39:52.550
Hey.
What are you doing here?

39:52.550 --> 39:54.790
I haven't been able
to concentrate all day.

39:56.920 --> 39:59.830
That was a mistake.
It was lovely.

39:59.830 --> 40:02.760
But, Saanvi,
I've made my choice,

40:02.760 --> 40:05.260
and it's my family,
my husband.

40:05.260 --> 40:07.100
You and I...

40:07.100 --> 40:09.540
we can never
do that again.

40:09.540 --> 40:11.440
Do what again?

40:11.440 --> 40:15.840
Us. In the park.

40:15.840 --> 40:18.310
I don't remember
being at the park.

40:18.310 --> 40:22.450
I don't remember
where I was this morning.

40:22.450 --> 40:25.520
I don't...

40:25.520 --> 40:27.690
I don't remember a thing.

40:51.540 --> 40:53.510
Hey.
Hey.

40:53.510 --> 40:54.780
You okay?

40:54.780 --> 40:56.250
Yeah.

40:58.450 --> 41:01.450
No. Not really.

41:08.960 --> 41:10.960
What's up?

41:13.470 --> 41:16.140
Jared...

41:16.140 --> 41:19.270
betrayed me in a way
that I can't even describe.

41:19.270 --> 41:21.870
There's no way to justify
what he's done,

41:21.870 --> 41:27.380
but  why do I feel like
I deserve it?

41:27.380 --> 41:31.750
'Cause you have
a huge heart.

41:31.750 --> 41:34.190
I'm so glad I have you

41:34.190 --> 41:38.020
and that we can
trust each other.

41:38.020 --> 41:40.490
Me, too.

41:43.030 --> 41:45.800
Michaela, I gotta...

41:45.800 --> 41:47.430
What?

41:50.100 --> 41:51.500
Zeke, what is this?

41:51.500 --> 41:53.610
Frost bite.

41:53.610 --> 41:55.410
It's happening.

41:55.410 --> 41:57.440
No.

41:57.440 --> 42:00.680
No, no, no. I can't lose you.
I can't.

42:00.680 --> 42:02.210
Saanvi thinks
she can help.

42:02.210 --> 42:04.420
She may have a cure.

42:04.420 --> 42:06.750
I'm not giving up
without a fight.
