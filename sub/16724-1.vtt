00:02.246 --> 00:04.214
(indistinct arguing)

00:04.215 --> 00:06.516
- DOUG: Your son ruined everything!
- LINDA: My son is a star!

00:06.551 --> 00:09.386
(talking over each other)
Calm down, Linda, calm down.

00:09.387 --> 00:10.854
He's the future
Neil Patrick Harris!

00:10.855 --> 00:12.489
What? Neil Patrick Harris is
way more talented than Gene.

00:12.490 --> 00:14.023
FROND: Quiet down, everyone!

00:14.024 --> 00:14.825
Thank you.

00:14.859 --> 00:16.292
Now, there's
a lot of parents

00:16.293 --> 00:17.494
and children
waiting out there

00:17.495 --> 00:18.862
that came to see
the fall musical,

00:18.863 --> 00:20.330
but it seems that we have

00:20.331 --> 00:21.598
some conflict going on here.

00:21.599 --> 00:24.433
Luckily, conflict
has one enemy: Me.

00:24.434 --> 00:26.435
So I'm going to get out
my peace pad

00:26.436 --> 00:28.738
and we are going
to process this mess

00:28.739 --> 00:30.606
and put it to rest.

00:30.607 --> 00:32.540
Now, who wants
to tell me what happened?

00:32.542 --> 00:33.776
I'll tell it!

00:33.777 --> 00:35.611
Well, hey, why does
he get to tell it?

00:35.612 --> 00:37.580
Because he's my
beautiful boy, that's why.

00:37.581 --> 00:39.082
Yeah, and you're
just someone's dad.

00:39.083 --> 00:40.316
Yeah, my dad.

00:40.317 --> 00:41.784
People, please! Gene...

00:41.818 --> 00:44.954
It started with
the school announcements...

00:44.955 --> 00:47.390
MS. LABONZ (over P.A.):
Attention Wagstaff student body.

00:47.391 --> 00:49.192
The fall musical is coming up,

00:49.193 --> 00:51.026
and we're not
doing <i>Grease</i> again.

00:51.027 --> 00:53.053
I can't!
I'm not doing it!

00:53.062 --> 00:55.097
For this year,
we will be accepting

00:55.098 --> 00:57.432
student submissions for
an original production.

00:57.433 --> 00:58.566
(gasps)

00:58.567 --> 00:59.667
So, if there's anyone out there

00:59.668 --> 01:01.603
- who's creative...
- Me.

01:01.604 --> 01:03.338
- Talented...
- Me!

01:03.339 --> 01:04.506
And musically brilliant...

01:04.540 --> 01:05.673
Me!

01:05.674 --> 01:07.009
...this is your big chance.

01:07.010 --> 01:09.344
Also, today's lunch is tacos.

01:09.345 --> 01:10.645
Tacos?!

01:10.646 --> 01:12.480
This is the best
day of my life!

01:12.481 --> 01:14.016
Shirt rip!

01:14.017 --> 01:15.350
(grunting)

01:16.852 --> 01:18.320
- You guys!
- This is it!

01:18.321 --> 01:19.454
I can finally unleash

01:19.455 --> 01:20.988
my passion project
on the world!

01:20.989 --> 01:22.123
Are you talking
about...

01:22.124 --> 01:23.917
<i>Die Hard,
the Musical!</i>

01:23.926 --> 01:26.003
You've been working on
that one for a while.

01:26.028 --> 01:29.363
Yeah, ever since I saw <i>Die Hard</i>
and said, why is no one singing?

01:29.364 --> 01:30.597
Why is no one dancing?

01:30.598 --> 01:31.883
What's wrong with Hollywood?

01:31.900 --> 01:33.901
Uh-oh. Who's got
a necklace in her mouth,

01:33.902 --> 01:35.429
is smothering, and
like-likes you?

01:35.437 --> 01:36.971
- Mom?
- LOUISE: No, Courtney.

01:36.972 --> 01:37.738
Oh, no.

01:37.739 --> 01:38.806
Hey, Gene.
Ooh...

01:38.840 --> 01:40.308
Okay, she wants
you back.

01:40.309 --> 01:41.375
I'll handle this.

01:41.376 --> 01:43.510
Look, Courtney, I know
you want to get with this.

01:43.511 --> 01:45.346
Okay? But honey...

01:45.347 --> 01:46.680
It's a mess.

01:46.681 --> 01:48.900
I mean, what are we
even looking at here?

01:48.917 --> 01:51.351
Uh, no, I don't want
to get back together.

01:51.352 --> 01:52.920
This is about the musical.

01:52.921 --> 01:54.721
I bet you're doing
the <i>Die Hard</i> One, right?

01:54.722 --> 01:56.356
He let me read it
when we were dating.

01:56.357 --> 01:58.792
That's it, Courtney.
Just remember the good times.

01:58.793 --> 02:01.127
Anyway, I'd love to be in it.

02:01.128 --> 02:03.597
And I've been taking
a hip-hop dance class...

02:03.598 --> 02:06.066
(muttering):
I my am Courtney I am...

02:06.067 --> 02:08.602
I like to give...
and I go to the...

02:08.603 --> 02:10.937
I... ho ho, and this...

02:10.937 --> 02:12.738
the ho ho, and now I'm done.

02:12.739 --> 02:14.874
(breathing hard):
So, yeah.

02:14.908 --> 02:16.275
First of all, I love it.

02:16.276 --> 02:17.309
Second of all, no.

02:17.310 --> 02:19.479
Only because I want
my play to be good.

02:19.480 --> 02:20.680
I totally get it.

02:20.681 --> 02:23.349
That dance was horrible,
and I'm really annoying.

02:23.350 --> 02:24.478
Anyway, bye!

02:24.485 --> 02:26.418
- What?
- I didn't say that.

02:26.419 --> 02:28.454
But I think I captured
the spirit of your words.

02:28.455 --> 02:29.856
I am not annoying.

02:29.857 --> 02:31.423
Well...
Yeah, you are.

02:31.424 --> 02:32.558
Yeah, it's bad.

02:32.559 --> 02:34.059
Well, I remember
it this way.

02:34.060 --> 02:36.261
May I be in your
<i>Die Hard</i> musical, please?

02:36.262 --> 02:37.429
No! I like tacos!

02:37.430 --> 02:38.397
(farts)

02:38.398 --> 02:39.365
Yeah, that
sounds like Gene.

02:39.366 --> 02:40.366
Yep.

02:40.367 --> 02:42.201
Anyway, along came the day

02:42.202 --> 02:44.203
we were all supposed
to submit our plays...

02:44.204 --> 02:46.038
So what's your
fall musical about?

02:46.039 --> 02:47.339
Leaves.
(blows note)

02:47.340 --> 02:49.774
♪ Red, yellow,
orange and brown ♪

02:49.775 --> 02:52.411
♪ They're on the tree
then they fall down. ♪

02:52.412 --> 02:54.546
Good...
(piano playing)

02:54.547 --> 02:56.181
Wait, who's in there now?

02:56.182 --> 02:58.450
♪ I've got the passion
of a woman ♪

02:58.451 --> 03:00.019
♪ Looking for her start

03:00.020 --> 03:03.822
♪ And the only thing
bigger than my hair ♪

03:03.823 --> 03:06.324
(off-key):
♪ Is my heart!

03:06.325 --> 03:08.493
And that's just one
of the amazing songs

03:08.494 --> 03:10.929
from <i>Working Girl,
the Musical!</i>

03:10.963 --> 03:13.565
Courtney!
You stole my thunder!

03:13.566 --> 03:14.900
No, I didn't.

03:14.934 --> 03:16.801
So it's just a coincidence

03:16.802 --> 03:18.603
you took a beloved movie
from the 1980s...

03:18.604 --> 03:21.439
some say the sassy
sister film to <i>Die Hard...</i>

03:21.440 --> 03:23.875
and set it to music and lyrics?
Thunder thief!

03:23.876 --> 03:26.277
I'm sorry, but that
keyboard is adorable.

03:26.278 --> 03:27.746
Did you rescue it
from a shelter?

03:27.747 --> 03:29.080
Nice one, Daddy.

03:29.081 --> 03:31.416
Well, where'd you get
your keyboard, Doug,

03:31.417 --> 03:33.051
the Too-Big Keyboard Store?

03:33.052 --> 03:34.685
Enough keyboard insults.

03:34.686 --> 03:36.187
Gene, it'll be your turn
in a minute

03:36.188 --> 03:37.655
and we can hear what you've got.

03:37.689 --> 03:39.457
You'll hear what
I've got, all right.

03:39.458 --> 03:41.392
Because it is very audible!

03:41.393 --> 03:45.096
(chanting): Nakatomi, Nakatomi,
Nakatomi, Nakatomi,

03:45.130 --> 03:47.031
Nakatomi, Nakatomi, Nakatomi...

03:47.032 --> 03:48.899
Okay, I'm gonna stop you there.

03:48.934 --> 03:50.801
But I haven't even...
It's fine, don't worry.

03:50.835 --> 03:51.802
Thank you.

03:51.803 --> 03:53.504
Peter, you can
come in now.

03:53.505 --> 03:55.806
Ready to catch my fall musical?

03:55.807 --> 03:57.508
It's fall, y'all!

03:57.509 --> 03:59.343
Ms. LaBonz, did I mention
that I know Carly Simon,

03:59.344 --> 04:00.778
the artist behind
the <i>Working Girl</i>

04:00.779 --> 04:02.113
and "Let the River Run,"

04:02.114 --> 04:03.847
and if we do our play,
she'll come to the show?

04:03.882 --> 04:05.415
We're doing <i>Working Girl!</i>

04:05.450 --> 04:06.584
- Yeah!
- All right!

04:06.618 --> 04:08.819
- Aah!
- Oh.

04:08.820 --> 04:10.187
Oh, my poor baby!

04:10.188 --> 04:12.723
- My baby.
- Lin, not so hard.

04:12.724 --> 04:13.857
Can we please
stay focused here?

04:13.858 --> 04:15.358
We absolutely can,
Mr. Frond.

04:15.359 --> 04:16.326
Let me take over.

04:16.327 --> 04:19.228
You see, being
the generous soul that I am,

04:19.230 --> 04:21.331
I had to step in
and help a brother out.

04:21.332 --> 04:23.767
Louise, why are we
in the boiler room?

04:23.768 --> 04:26.236
I want to just go home
and crawl into bed

04:26.237 --> 04:28.305
and have a good, long
dutch oven cry.

04:28.306 --> 04:29.272
Buck up, Gene.

04:29.273 --> 04:30.908
It's like I scream
into my pillow

04:30.909 --> 04:32.709
every time I don't get
a horse on my birthday:

04:32.710 --> 04:34.010
There's always
next year!

04:34.011 --> 04:36.312
Guys! There's a
secret boiler room

04:36.313 --> 04:38.214
in the back of the boiler room
that no one knows about.

04:38.215 --> 04:39.381
I think, in the olden days,

04:39.382 --> 04:41.417
they used it as
the faculty opium den.

04:42.252 --> 04:43.552
Great.
So why are we here?

04:43.587 --> 04:45.254
We're here because this room

04:45.255 --> 04:47.323
happens to be under
the very auditorium

04:47.324 --> 04:50.026
where <i>Working Girl, the Musical
is gonna be performed.</i>

04:50.027 --> 04:52.194
Then this is where
I want to die!

04:52.195 --> 04:54.097
No, listen!
You're gonna put on

04:54.098 --> 04:55.832
the guerilla-slash-protest
production

04:55.833 --> 04:59.501
of <i>Die Hard, the Musical
on the same night, in here!</i>

04:59.502 --> 05:01.737
It's the perfect way
to stick it to Courtney,

05:01.738 --> 05:03.538
right in her
thunder-stealing face!

05:03.539 --> 05:05.340
(gasps)
It's brilliant!

05:05.341 --> 05:06.541
The symbolism!

05:06.542 --> 05:09.778
We'll be up-staging her
from down-stairs-stage!

05:09.812 --> 05:11.246
No, what's
brilliant is

05:11.247 --> 05:13.715
we're going to charge
five bucks a head.

05:13.750 --> 05:15.450
Wow!
What a considerate

05:15.451 --> 05:18.286
- and lucrative solution to Gene's problem.
- I know!

05:18.287 --> 05:19.955
You're the smartest person
in the whole world!

05:19.956 --> 05:21.189
I know!

05:21.190 --> 05:22.524
(chanting):
Louise is the best!

05:22.525 --> 05:25.493
Louise is the best!
Louise is the best!

05:25.494 --> 05:27.395
Louise is the best!

05:27.396 --> 05:29.621
What?

05:31.087 --> 05:33.322
What's taking so long?
Waiting is gross.

05:33.323 --> 05:34.923
Yeah, the show must go on!

05:34.924 --> 05:36.124
That's a thing, right?

05:36.158 --> 05:38.292
Well, Gene, you
violated school rules

05:38.293 --> 05:40.461
by entering the prohibited
secret boiler room...

05:40.462 --> 05:41.596
Yup.

05:41.597 --> 05:43.765
You decided to put on
a guerilla-slash-protest play

05:43.766 --> 05:46.388
- the same night as the fall musical...
- Amazing.

05:46.402 --> 05:49.103
Things are not stacking up
in your favor here.

05:49.104 --> 05:51.305
Do you want the whole story
or not, Mr. Frond?

05:51.340 --> 05:53.141
Oh, my God, every word.
I could do this all night.

05:53.175 --> 05:55.376
So things were really
coming together...

05:55.377 --> 05:57.611
Okay, we got the musical,
we got the venue.

05:57.612 --> 05:59.513
Now all we need
is the actors.

05:59.514 --> 06:01.248
Right. Do you know
Sir Ian McKellen?

06:01.249 --> 06:02.683
No.
- Crap.

06:02.684 --> 06:05.318
Hello, Courtney.
Cool piece of paper.

06:05.319 --> 06:06.787
Gene, if you're here to try out

06:06.788 --> 06:08.321
for <i>Working Girl, the Musical,
you're too late.</i>

06:08.322 --> 06:09.757
I'm posting
the cast list right now.

06:09.758 --> 06:11.291
But I suppose I
could work you in,

06:11.292 --> 06:12.492
as like a really
stupid stapler

06:12.493 --> 06:13.961
or a desk
or something.

06:13.962 --> 06:15.262
I'd be an
incredible stapler!

06:15.296 --> 06:16.697
But don't even worry about it,

06:16.698 --> 06:18.131
- 'cause I'm putting on a pl...
- Weight!

06:18.132 --> 06:19.567
He's putting on
a lot of weight,

06:19.568 --> 06:21.535
not being in any plays or
talking about other plays

06:21.536 --> 06:23.803
that could get
him in trouble.

06:23.804 --> 06:25.505
Oh, right...

06:25.506 --> 06:27.074
Oh, well, good luck
with your weight gain.

06:27.075 --> 06:28.841
Looks like you're
almost there, bye!

06:28.842 --> 06:30.310
Thank you.

06:30.344 --> 06:32.045
You guys,
I'm secretary number one!

06:32.046 --> 06:33.780
Eat it, two and three!

06:33.781 --> 06:34.948
Yay!

06:34.949 --> 06:36.249
- Aw, man.
- Come on!

06:36.250 --> 06:39.286
Well, Mom, I guess I don't have
the dashing good looks and charm

06:39.287 --> 06:41.221
of a medium-young Harrison Ford.

06:41.255 --> 06:43.557
I think I've
found our cast.

06:43.558 --> 06:46.656
LOUISE: May I present the People
that Didn't Get Cast

06:46.660 --> 06:49.295
in Courtney's Play But Still
Want to Be in a Play Players.

06:49.329 --> 06:51.230
Yep, did not make the cut.

06:51.231 --> 06:53.031
I guess I'll have to win
an Oscar for wrestling.

06:53.032 --> 06:55.501
Is it because I can't <i>not</i> sing
like Mariah Carey?

06:55.502 --> 06:57.936
♪ I can't help it.

06:57.937 --> 06:59.771
- We stepped on each other's lines.
- We stepped on each other's lines.

06:59.806 --> 07:01.773
Miss Merkin, what
are you doing here?

07:01.774 --> 07:05.711
I've played piano for the
Wagstaff Musical for 24 years.

07:05.712 --> 07:08.247
Then Doug comes in
and pushes me out!

07:08.281 --> 07:10.116
Well, how are you
with a Casio?

07:10.117 --> 07:12.485
(plays beautiful riff,
adds dog bark)

07:12.486 --> 07:14.220
I think I can manage.

07:14.221 --> 07:15.554
Oh, wait.
We still need a girl

07:15.555 --> 07:16.855
to play Holly
Gennaro McClane.

07:16.856 --> 07:19.225
- So I guess that's you?
- Oh, no way.

07:19.226 --> 07:21.059
I'm that blond bad-ass
guy or nothing.

07:21.060 --> 07:22.728
Fine, then it's Tina.
Where is Tina?

07:22.729 --> 07:24.529
TINA:

07:32.571 --> 07:34.454

But your characters don't even
end up together!

07:46.519 --> 07:47.619
We're all allowed to interpret
the movie differently.

07:47.620 --> 07:49.121
No, they definitely
don't end up together.

07:49.122 --> 07:50.122
Eh, to each his own.

07:50.123 --> 07:51.289
No, they
really don't.

07:51.290 --> 07:52.690
Well, comme ci comme Ã§a.

07:52.691 --> 07:54.091
All right, well, now
you're just saying words.

07:54.092 --> 07:55.308
C'est la vie.

07:55.326 --> 07:58.328

07:58.329 --> 08:00.397

call it yesterday...

08:00.398 --> 08:01.966
See you at my play
tomorrow night.

08:01.967 --> 08:04.334
I wrote a play, we're doing it
tomorrow, see you there.

08:04.369 --> 08:06.370
Where? Wait...
You hear that?

08:06.371 --> 08:07.772
It's the sound of
me having a play

08:07.773 --> 08:09.573

Ow! Okay...

08:35.198 --> 08:36.666
- Come on!
- GENE: No, no, no, no!

08:36.701 --> 08:38.301
John McClane
is in a tower.

08:38.302 --> 08:40.403
Sergeant Al Powell
is on the ground!

08:40.404 --> 08:41.671
You can't wrestle!

08:41.672 --> 08:43.707
- I made a creative choice.
- Very bold.

08:43.741 --> 08:45.374
And Rudy, you're moving
your hands too much.

08:45.375 --> 08:46.693
And quit wheezing!

08:46.711 --> 08:48.678
(wheezing):
I'm sorry, the asbestos might be

08:48.679 --> 08:51.214
affecting my lungs a little,
but I'll work on it.

08:51.215 --> 08:52.881
Um, can we turn down the heat?

08:52.882 --> 08:54.450
Yeah, it's boiling
up in here!

08:54.451 --> 08:55.851
It's the boiler
room, Zeke!

08:55.852 --> 08:57.119
It's what it does!

08:57.120 --> 08:59.255
It's like you guys
don't even care about this

08:59.256 --> 09:00.923
guerilla-slash-protest musical

09:00.924 --> 09:02.991
designed to take down Courtney
and send us to Broadway!

09:02.992 --> 09:03.926
Uh, Gene.

09:03.927 --> 09:05.294
- (clears throat) A... a word?
- Mm-hmm.

09:05.295 --> 09:07.196
The play is
tomorrow night.

09:07.197 --> 09:08.598
We gotta get
it together.

09:08.599 --> 09:10.233
Give 'em a pep
talk, you know?

09:10.234 --> 09:11.701
Put some fire
in their butts!

09:11.702 --> 09:13.569
Is the putting
a fire in the butt

09:13.570 --> 09:14.604
part of the inspiration,

09:14.605 --> 09:15.771
or is that
a separate suggestion?

09:15.772 --> 09:17.640
- Ugh, damn it.
- Fine.

09:17.674 --> 09:19.841
Listen up: I wrote an
incredible musical.

09:19.842 --> 09:22.544
And I thought together we'd
create the kind of theater

09:22.545 --> 09:24.312
that would make the gods cry.

09:24.347 --> 09:26.147
But now I'm like,
"What am I, nuts?"

09:26.148 --> 09:27.449
You're all blowing it!

09:27.450 --> 09:28.950
Zeke with your wrestling,

09:28.951 --> 09:30.552
Darryl and your
extra-note singing,

09:30.553 --> 09:32.186
Crazy Arm Rudy over here!

09:32.187 --> 09:33.321
Andy and Ollie,

09:33.322 --> 09:35.390
FBI agents don't hold hands!

09:35.391 --> 09:36.824
These ones do.

09:36.825 --> 09:38.993
Yeah, and they sleep
in the same bed.

09:38.994 --> 09:41.396
And now I'm realizing
that the only way

09:41.397 --> 09:42.830
to make this production shine

09:42.831 --> 09:45.600
is if I fire all of you
and play all the roles myself!

09:45.601 --> 09:46.868
Uh... (chuckling)

09:46.902 --> 09:48.903
Say what?
Except for Miss Merkin.

09:48.904 --> 09:50.739
You're my rock, girl.
Thank you.

09:50.740 --> 09:52.140
And I've been thinking
about getting you

09:52.141 --> 09:53.407
drums and maybe
a cute top.

09:53.408 --> 09:54.642
You cool with that?
You know it.

09:54.643 --> 09:56.143
So congratulations,

09:56.144 --> 09:58.245
the rest of you
have been demoted to stagehands

09:58.246 --> 10:01.315
on <i>Die Hard, the Musical,
a one-Gene show!</i>

10:01.316 --> 10:02.616
Hurray.

10:02.651 --> 10:04.117
It's gonna kick ass.

10:05.797 --> 10:07.266
So you fired the casting,

10:07.267 --> 10:09.629
and made <i>Die Hard, the Musical</i>
a one-man show?

10:09.663 --> 10:11.497
Yes, starring me. Gene. Yeah.

10:11.532 --> 10:12.932
Okay, well,
I've come to the part

10:12.933 --> 10:15.026
where I blame the parents.
Bob, Linda...

10:15.027 --> 10:16.068
- Hi.
- Uh-huh?

10:16.069 --> 10:17.269
- I'm blaming you.
- Yeah. Oh.

10:17.304 --> 10:19.338
Why didn't you step in
and do something here?

10:19.339 --> 10:20.640
Hey, we don't know
all the crazy crap

10:20.641 --> 10:22.664
our kids are doing.
We don't want to know.

10:22.676 --> 10:24.610
But I did start
to get suspicious

10:24.611 --> 10:26.579
when we were walking
into the fall musical

10:26.580 --> 10:28.881
and I found this weird
thing in my pocket.

10:28.882 --> 10:30.582

15:13.226 --> 15:15.493
I accidentally grabbed

No, no, my play!

Tell that

I-I have to admit,
watching one person

a little... bad.

Courtney's was all slick
like a kid didn't even do it.

15:47.926 --> 15:50.427
That's because a kid
could never do it. Never!

15:50.428 --> 15:51.796
Oh, yeah?

15:51.797 --> 15:53.697
My son's not the one
who promised Carly Simon,

15:53.698 --> 15:54.999
and then left
everyone hanging!

15:55.000 --> 15:57.201
She just texted me
that she was car-jacked,

15:57.202 --> 15:59.070
but she's still going
to try to make it!

15:59.071 --> 16:01.305
So we should finish
our play, Mr. Frond.

16:01.306 --> 16:02.406
Yeah!

16:02.407 --> 16:03.807
(stammers)
No, no, no, no, no.

16:03.808 --> 16:05.276
My mother was right.

16:05.277 --> 16:07.611
This musical theater stuff is
just too dangerous.

16:07.612 --> 16:09.112
So for the safety of everyone,

16:09.113 --> 16:11.282
there will be no more
musicals tonight.

16:11.283 --> 16:12.115
And maybe ever!

16:12.116 --> 16:13.417
LOUISE: What?
LINDA and TINA: No!

16:13.418 --> 16:14.682
I don't know if I have
that authority,

16:14.686 --> 16:16.754
but at least for tonight,
it's finished.

16:16.755 --> 16:18.121
- Oh, come on!
- No!

16:20.533 --> 16:21.862
What happened?

16:21.863 --> 16:23.030
Are we gonna finish
the play?

16:23.031 --> 16:24.132
No, come here.

16:24.133 --> 16:25.266
Shh-shh-shh.
Come here, come here.

16:25.267 --> 16:26.434
We'll get through this.

16:26.435 --> 16:27.668
I-I-I don't want...
No. No, thanks.

16:27.669 --> 16:29.570
Okay, time to go home,
everyone.

16:29.571 --> 16:30.571
Show's over.

16:30.572 --> 16:31.606
(all groaning)

16:31.607 --> 16:33.807
Yeah, the whole night
was a bust.

16:33.808 --> 16:35.443
Come on, Gene.
Let's go home.

16:40.593 --> 16:41.659
Wait! Mr. Frond!

16:41.694 --> 16:42.693
What?

16:42.695 --> 16:43.928
I guess one boy,

16:43.929 --> 16:45.362
no matter how talented...

16:45.363 --> 16:47.298
and charismatic...
and likable...

16:47.299 --> 16:50.434
doesn't have the right to ruin
musicals for everyone.

16:50.435 --> 16:52.869
So, Courtney,
you finish your play.

16:52.904 --> 16:53.937
Aw, Gene.

16:53.938 --> 16:54.972
So noble!

16:54.973 --> 16:56.807
No, Gene.
You were right.

16:56.808 --> 16:58.175
I did steal your thunder.

16:58.176 --> 17:00.478
<i>Working Girl is</i> the sassy
sister film to <i>Die Hard.</i>

17:00.479 --> 17:02.045
Everybody knows that.

17:02.046 --> 17:04.615
I was just so mad you wouldn't
let me be in your play.

17:04.616 --> 17:08.586
Well, maybe we can be
in each other's plays.

17:08.587 --> 17:09.685
I... What?!

17:09.686 --> 17:11.422
We just need three and a half
hours to prepare.

17:11.423 --> 17:13.556
Gene, it's 9:30, and I have
a lot of sweat in my underwear.

17:13.557 --> 17:14.625
Fine, fine.

17:14.626 --> 17:15.659
25 minutes.

17:15.660 --> 17:17.828
(stammers)
No way, Gene. This is done.

17:17.862 --> 17:19.229
Aw, too bad.

17:19.230 --> 17:21.196
Seems like that conflict
resolution could've been epic.

17:21.198 --> 17:22.633
Maybe award winning.

17:22.634 --> 17:23.733
Oh, my God.

17:23.734 --> 17:25.435
You think I could win
a Conflicty for this?!

17:25.435 --> 17:27.637
Yeah, you could win a Conflicty!

17:27.672 --> 17:29.239
Let's do it!

17:29.240 --> 17:30.907
(all cheering)

17:30.908 --> 17:33.076
All right,
come on, everybody!

17:33.077 --> 17:34.144
Take my hands.

17:34.145 --> 17:35.278
No, wait, wait.
Whoa.

17:35.279 --> 17:36.612
We got to do this ourselves.

17:36.613 --> 17:39.115
It's what Tess McGill
would've wanted.

17:39.116 --> 17:40.382
But Courtney,
honey...

17:40.383 --> 17:42.118
(muffled mumbling)
Sometimes... Shh!

17:42.119 --> 17:43.819
Sometimes to break
through the glass ceiling,

17:43.820 --> 17:45.487
you got to break
some hearts.

17:45.488 --> 17:47.289
And glass.

17:48.759 --> 17:51.160
You probably think
this slap is about you.

17:51.161 --> 17:52.461
Ow!

17:53.363 --> 17:54.964
So I don't know
if we can pull this off,

17:54.965 --> 17:57.366
I mean, we wrote and rehearsed
it in under 20 minutes,

17:57.367 --> 17:58.500
but if we do,

17:58.501 --> 17:59.934
it's because we did it together.

17:59.935 --> 18:00.955
All of us.

18:00.970 --> 18:02.370
That's exactly what people say

18:02.371 --> 18:03.805
before they make a baby,
I think.

18:03.806 --> 18:06.474
Okay, well,

18:06.475 --> 18:10.211
