00:02.068 --> 00:05.401
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

00:05.505 --> 00:07.496
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

00:07.607 --> 00:09.598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

00:15.148 --> 00:16.843
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

00:19.119 --> 00:21.610
<i>Michael had received a witness list...</i>

00:21.721 --> 00:23.621
<i>for his father's upcoming trial.</i>

00:23.723 --> 00:25.691
Who's on the list?
Any blabbers?

00:25.792 --> 00:27.851
They've got one guy
who won't be talking.

00:27.961 --> 00:30.452
That is, unless,
there's a hand inside of him.

00:30.563 --> 00:33.293
- Please, Michael. Even then, I wouldn't
say anything. - That's reassuring.

00:33.400 --> 00:35.925
- But I was referring to Gob's puppet Franklin.
- Yes!

00:36.036 --> 00:38.527
- I got him in the system.
- You did this on purpose?

00:38.638 --> 00:42.404
Oh, yeah. He is re-dyed, rested,
and ready to work.

00:42.509 --> 00:45.205
Oughta be a good way to get some press.
Oh, I gotta tell Franklin.

00:45.311 --> 00:48.041
- I think he meant "get Franklin."
- Am I on the list?

00:48.148 --> 00:50.616
- We all are.
<i>- Franklin, guess what.</i>

00:50.717 --> 00:52.878
- But I don't know anything.
- He hasn't heard anything from me.

00:52.986 --> 00:55.921
- I don't know anything.
- You both certainly act innocent.

00:56.022 --> 00:57.990
<i>Buster knew a great deal...</i>

00:58.091 --> 01:00.889
<i>for Lucille almost nightly
got drunk and told him.</i>

01:00.994 --> 01:05.191
Your father says he wants me
to go all the way to Fallujah.

01:05.298 --> 01:08.734
I thought he meant the sex act
that's so popular with your generation.

01:08.835 --> 01:11.565
I know you're awake. Faker!

01:11.671 --> 01:16.074
More significantly, they've put
an N. Bluth on the witness list.

01:16.176 --> 01:19.805
I hope that doesn't stand for what I think
it stands for. Whoa! I did not say that.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.813
You did, Gob.
Your mouth moved. Your hand didn't.

01:21.915 --> 01:24.247
Oh. Well, I should work on that.

01:24.350 --> 01:26.978
Is there an N. Bluth in the family
that we don't know about?

01:27.087 --> 01:30.250
They say there's been money found
in an account under that name.

01:30.356 --> 01:32.824
Of course not.
The prosecution is trying to test us...

01:32.926 --> 01:35.326
see if we're gonna
turn against each other.

01:35.428 --> 01:39.091
They make stuff up.
She doesn't exist.

01:39.199 --> 01:41.429
Uh, yet, you refer to her as a "she."

01:41.534 --> 01:44.469
- He, she... What's the difference?
- Hear! Hear!

01:44.571 --> 01:47.506
In the dark, it all looks the same.

01:47.607 --> 01:50.303
They're probably just taking
a shot in the darkness.

01:50.410 --> 01:53.311
But the good news is that
Jan Eagleman called...

01:53.413 --> 01:56.280
and she is willing
to consider our case.

01:56.382 --> 01:59.283
- Jan Eagleman?
- She's from the Justice TV.

01:59.385 --> 02:01.615
Not another media whore.

02:01.721 --> 02:04.656
You know, frankly, I think I can
put together a pretty good defense.

02:04.757 --> 02:06.782
Oh, no.
He thinks he's a lawyer again.

02:06.893 --> 02:08.554
<i>Devotees will remember that Michael...</i>

02:08.661 --> 02:11.789
<i>once played a lawyer
in a school play.</i>

02:15.435 --> 02:18.632
You know, just because
you played a role doesn't make it real.

02:18.738 --> 02:21.571
Of course, Buster did grow up
to be Captain Hook.

02:21.674 --> 02:25.303
- Not cool, Mom.
- Oh, please. You'd be a lousy attorney.

02:25.411 --> 02:28.107
The first piece of evidence against us,
you'd run for the hills.

02:28.214 --> 02:30.546
No, Jan is interested.
She carries a lot of weight...

02:30.650 --> 02:33.016
and she is not
charging us anything.

02:33.119 --> 02:35.019
Like to see a whore that does that!

02:35.121 --> 02:37.385
Not the "carrying the weight" part.

02:37.490 --> 02:39.390
But, on the other hand,
if it's free...

02:39.492 --> 02:43.485
She wants us to do a mock trial.
Sort of a dry run just to get us ready.

02:43.596 --> 02:46.861
I guess we could all use some experience
in the courtroom. I'll go check her out.

02:46.966 --> 02:50.197
But I'll tell you all right now,
no one is going to lie on that stand.

02:50.303 --> 02:53.329
And no one is gonna
betray the family.

02:53.439 --> 02:56.101
<i>Buster was nervous.</i>

02:56.209 --> 02:59.406
<i>That's what all the rocking
and humming was about.</i>

02:59.512 --> 03:02.606
<i>And Michael met with
Justice TV's Jan Eagleman...</i>

03:02.715 --> 03:05.741
<i>who was currently doing
a tech rehearsal.</i>

03:05.852 --> 03:08.343
We're doing a tech rehearsal
for my new <i>show... Judge Reinhold.</i>

03:08.454 --> 03:11.389
- It's a reality courtroom show. - You know
that there's an actor by that name, right?

03:11.491 --> 03:13.584
This is what they put me in.
Why did I lose all the weight...

03:13.693 --> 03:15.593
if they're gonna
put me in a pool cover?

03:15.695 --> 03:19.631
- I'm sorry. Are you an actual judge?
- No. That's just a coincidence.

03:19.732 --> 03:23.964
I read somewhere Judge Judy
made $25 million last year.

03:24.070 --> 03:26.903
I'm, like, hey,
I never even heard of the guy.

03:27.006 --> 03:30.100
So you just... You're doin' this
because your name is Judge?

03:30.210 --> 03:32.872
Honestly, this is the first time
I put those two things together.

03:32.979 --> 03:35.106
Maybe we should take "Judge"
out of the title...

03:35.215 --> 03:37.877
and go with my original title:
<i>Mr. Reinhold's Courtroom.</i>

03:37.984 --> 03:40.612
No, no, no.
We're changin' the name.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.915
Thanks, Michael.

03:43.022 --> 03:46.583
I've got 250,000 talking magazine ads,
and he wants to change the name.

03:46.693 --> 03:48.661
<i>My name is Judge.</i>

03:48.761 --> 03:50.661
- Hear you wanna do a mock trial.
- Mmm.

03:50.763 --> 03:52.560
- Yeah?
- And we can do it here on the set.

03:52.665 --> 03:55.327
'Cause I'm looking for Judge Reinhold
to have a little practice too.

03:55.435 --> 03:57.403
- Uh-huh.
- I'll be acting as the prosecutor.

03:57.503 --> 03:59.630
That way, I can see
how your family holds up.

03:59.739 --> 04:02.731
Families that do well are
the ones that stick together.

04:04.210 --> 04:06.110
Well, that's-that's us.

04:06.212 --> 04:09.477
Um, we are going to need a defense
attorney, right, for the mock trial?

04:09.582 --> 04:12.745
- And that's not gonna be cheap.
- You know the case. Why not you?

04:15.722 --> 04:18.918
Yes. Yeah, give me a chance
to show my dad what I can do.

04:19.024 --> 04:21.755
I'll-I'll-I'll show him.
I'll make a fool out of him...

04:21.861 --> 04:24.489
while sticking together.

04:24.597 --> 04:27.760
- Excuse me one minute.
<i>- And that's when Michael found out...</i>

04:27.867 --> 04:29.994
<i>his brother Buster was in a coma.</i>

04:30.103 --> 04:32.367
- What happened? How is he?
- We're waiting for the doctor.

04:32.472 --> 04:36.636
I just pray it's one of those things where
he's unconscious throughout the entire trial...

04:36.743 --> 04:40.270
and when it's over he wakes up
and gets a big toy.

04:40.380 --> 04:42.610
Wait a minute.
Are you responsible for this, Mom?

04:42.715 --> 04:46.014
Did you put one of your sons
into a coma so that he can't testify?

04:46.119 --> 04:51.648
Michael, how dare you! Of course,
it crossed my mind, but this was all Buster.

04:51.758 --> 04:55.250
- He got into your brother's pills.
- Not the Forget-Me-Nows?

04:55.361 --> 04:58.228
He asked me for them. I didn't know.
I thought he was dating again.

04:58.331 --> 05:01.459
Hope you don't mind me saying,
but these things can go on indefinitely.

05:01.567 --> 05:04.161
My mother's been in that bed
for two years.

05:04.270 --> 05:07.535
Oh, how awful!
We don't have a private room.

05:07.640 --> 05:10.404
They won't let me take out
her feeding tube. And I'm lucky.

05:10.510 --> 05:12.637
I have the resources to pay
for these medical bills.

05:12.745 --> 05:14.679
You have resources?

05:14.781 --> 05:17.579
- What good is my money if I can't bring her back?
- But you can't.

05:17.684 --> 05:20.983
Money should be spent on dating.
Is that what you were gonna say?

05:21.087 --> 05:24.318
- Let's go ahead and wait outside.
- So, you come here often?

05:24.424 --> 05:26.585
Cute button.

05:26.693 --> 05:29.423
- How is he?
- We're still waitin' to find out.

05:29.529 --> 05:32.157
I got here as soon as I could.
Oh, the red tape.

05:32.265 --> 05:36.031
- Looks a little bit more like Red Prawn, Dad.
- It's the shrimp fest.

05:36.135 --> 05:37.659
Oh, the shrimp.

05:37.770 --> 05:40.898
Do you realize Buster's probably
in this state because of you and Mom?

05:41.007 --> 05:44.340
He's obviously afraid of what he knows,
and he's just trying to forget.

05:44.444 --> 05:46.344
Does he know who N. Bluth is?

05:46.446 --> 05:49.006
Right now, he doesn't know
who B. Bluth is.

05:49.115 --> 05:52.243
I'm gonna need some real answers outta you,
because I've just discussed it with Jan.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.252
I am going to be pretending
to be your attorney...

05:54.354 --> 05:57.448
at the mock trial
before Judge Reinhold.

05:57.557 --> 06:00.424
You're the lawyer? That's the same
representation Captain Hook had.

06:00.526 --> 06:03.586
It's so good to laugh again.

06:03.696 --> 06:05.596
- Oh, it feels good.
- It does.

06:05.698 --> 06:07.791
They say seven minutes
heals all wounds.

06:07.900 --> 06:11.961
Wait. Not the <i>Judge Reinhold</i> show
from all those magazine ads?

06:12.071 --> 06:16.474
- They're all over the place. Look at this.
<i>- My name is Judge.</i>

06:16.576 --> 06:18.601
I didn't even know that
this kind of technology existed.

06:18.711 --> 06:21.202
I could use this
in my ventriloquism act.

06:21.314 --> 06:23.942
There a bar here?

06:24.050 --> 06:27.486
Well, Buster's in what we call
a light-to-no coma.

06:27.587 --> 06:31.455
In layman's terms, it might be
considered a very heavy nap.

06:31.557 --> 06:34.082
- Could that mean that he's faking it?
- Highly likely this is fake.

06:34.193 --> 06:36.627
Although, there doesn't seem
to be very much brain activity.

06:36.729 --> 06:40.392
- No. That's him. - I think it's very
important we remember he's fully insured.

06:40.500 --> 06:43.230
- I say we see how this plays out.
- Absolutely.

06:43.336 --> 06:45.236
We're gonna be here every day.

06:45.338 --> 06:49.741
I don't care if it takes from now
till the end of shrimp fest.

06:49.842 --> 06:53.437
If this young man gets bored, we need
a lot of volunteers here at the hospital.

06:53.546 --> 06:55.605
Turning over the bedridden,
changing bedpans.

06:55.715 --> 06:58.343
- Or there's a mall across the street.
- Oh, you want excitement?

06:58.451 --> 07:00.351
Well, we have a group
of young people...

07:00.453 --> 07:02.944
who put on fake weddings
for our Alzheimer's patients.

07:03.055 --> 07:06.422
It actually would probably look pretty good
on some college applications.

07:06.526 --> 07:09.120
- Would I have to touch the old people?
- Only their hearts.

07:09.228 --> 07:12.095
You could be a groom.
Bring a little girlfriend up there with you.

07:12.198 --> 07:14.928
- I don't have a girlfriend.
- Sister then, or a cousin.

07:15.034 --> 07:17.525
Of course,
you're gonna have to kiss.

07:17.637 --> 07:19.605
<i>Guess who liked that idea?</i>

07:19.705 --> 07:23.106
He says he doesn't wanna do it. I'm actually
trying to respect his choices lately.

07:23.209 --> 07:26.144
Great. I was just...
Well, don't answer for... I, um...

07:26.245 --> 07:30.978
Yeah, 'cause I know exactly the cousin.
I mean, the girl.

07:31.083 --> 07:32.983
I would want to give,
and she'll wanna give too.

07:33.085 --> 07:36.452
And we'll do that together for them,
for the sake of...

07:36.556 --> 07:38.956
It's a great day...

07:40.560 --> 07:43.552
for being sad.

07:43.663 --> 07:46.860
<i>And later,
Michael was preparing for his case.</i>

07:46.966 --> 07:49.298
So I've got a date with the guy
with the brain-dead mom.

07:49.402 --> 07:52.894
I mean, it's just a picket for them
to pull the plug on our loved ones.

07:53.005 --> 07:55.496
Given up hope on Buster
pretty quickly there, Lindsay.

07:55.608 --> 07:58.543
Listen, I know Buster.
I know what he wants.

07:58.644 --> 08:00.339
Oh, I love soup.

08:00.446 --> 08:03.745
If the only thing I could do was lay in bed
all day and eat soup, I'd be happy.

08:03.850 --> 08:06.978
I wouldn't even have to taste it.
I could just take it through a tube.

08:07.086 --> 08:10.112
That would actually be better,
'cause I wouldn't even burn my mouth.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.884
Never let me die.

08:13.993 --> 08:18.396
Yeah, he wants out. Anyway, you and I
both know he's probably just faking.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.398
- Busy?
- Actually, I'm...

08:20.500 --> 08:22.661
Check this out. My lips don't move.
You'll call me up to the stand.

08:22.768 --> 08:25.134
Say something like,
"Who is this little friend?" And he'll say:

08:25.238 --> 08:27.536
<i>- My name is Judge.</i>
- Whose name is Judge?

08:27.640 --> 08:29.938
<i>- My name is...</i> - Okay.
- That's a silly name.

08:30.042 --> 08:32.772
- That's enough.
<i>- Judge. My name...</i>

08:32.879 --> 08:35.609
- Yes, I am judging your name. It am silly.
<i>- Is...</i>

08:35.715 --> 08:37.909
- Please stop.
- Now you're correcting my grammar?

08:38.017 --> 08:41.009
Gob, not gonna put Franklin on the stand.
And your lips are moving just a little bit.

08:41.120 --> 08:43.520
- Judge.
- He's right. His name is Judge now.

08:43.623 --> 08:46.057
You know, I think Dad
might actually have a case here.

08:46.158 --> 08:48.558
I mean, I am concerned
about this N. Bluth.

08:48.661 --> 08:52.654
But if it is indeed just a ploy on their part,
then the only bombshell they've got...

08:52.765 --> 08:56.326
is a blueprint
of an Iraqi model home...

08:56.435 --> 08:59.233
the same blueprint as ours
with no record...

08:59.338 --> 09:01.238
that we actually got paid for it.

09:01.340 --> 09:05.276
Although, this is strange. Looks like there's
a secret room in this one off the hallway.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.471
I wonder if we've got that.
I'm gonna go check that out.

09:07.580 --> 09:11.539
- Okay, and we're gonna go back to the hospital.
- Yeah, good. Check on Buster.

09:11.651 --> 09:13.812
We do need to stick together
as a family on this.

09:13.920 --> 09:17.913
Actually, gonna go swipe some more talking
magazines, but I'll make sure to poke the head in.

09:18.024 --> 09:20.322
Bye.

09:22.395 --> 09:27.332
<i>And Michael found that
there was indeed a secret room...</i>

09:27.433 --> 09:32.530
<i>where his father had stored the family
mementoes, including his birth certificate.</i>

09:32.638 --> 09:34.572
<i>"Nichael Bluth"?</i>

09:35.975 --> 09:38.068
Am I N. Bluth?

09:38.177 --> 09:43.240
Is he trying to set me up?
If I'm N. Bluth, I'm going to prison.

09:43.349 --> 09:45.647
<i>Nichael was worried.</i>

09:50.089 --> 09:53.388
<i>Michael had just discovered
a hidden room in the model home...</i>

09:53.492 --> 09:55.983
<i>where all the family secrets
were stored.</i>

09:56.095 --> 10:01.499
My dad's trying to pin all of his crimes
on N. Bluth, and I might be N. Bluth.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.626
- Huh. - That's what it says
according to my birth certificate.

10:03.736 --> 10:06.204
- All of our family records are up here.
- Hmm.

10:06.305 --> 10:10.298
And for some reason, this stack
of bodybuilding magazines.

10:10.409 --> 10:13.936
Well, I guess your dad must've
had these from way back when, huh?

10:14.046 --> 10:16.173
<i>- My name is...</i>
- That seems kind of current.

10:16.282 --> 10:18.443
Oh! Who am I trying to kid, Michael?

10:18.551 --> 10:20.746
I was trying to beef up
to impress that wife of mine.

10:20.853 --> 10:23.321
But now she's after some rich guy
who's trying to kill his mom.

10:23.422 --> 10:26.152
I gotta go talk to my dad.
You comin' out?

10:26.258 --> 10:28.283
No. No, I have
to fight for my wife.

10:28.394 --> 10:30.225
I'm gonna keep my marriage alive.

10:32.665 --> 10:34.860
<i>One room over, George Michael...</i>

10:34.967 --> 10:38.459
<i>was also trying to convince someone
to pursue a fake marriage.</i>

10:38.571 --> 10:42.132
We'd have to kiss. Wouldn't that be kind
of weird after what we've been through?

10:42.241 --> 10:44.141
Well, that was a long time ago.

10:44.243 --> 10:46.677
<i>It had been two months since they'd kissed.</i>

10:46.779 --> 10:49.373
Well, it does sound like
a good twist on a wedding film.

10:49.482 --> 10:52.645
- A-A film? - Without the corny
"runaway bride" bit in the middle.

10:52.752 --> 10:55.243
- Oh, yeah.
<i>- And so, like many people...</i>

10:55.354 --> 10:59.415
<i>who no longer felt anything for
each other, they decided to get married.</i>

10:59.525 --> 11:02.983
I'm N. Bluth, aren't I?
Legally, that's my real name.

11:03.095 --> 11:06.656
You've been doing all the Iraq business
under it thinking it wouldn't be traceable.

11:06.766 --> 11:10.634
- But it is, and I'm going down.
- For God's sakes, it's a typo, Michael.

11:10.736 --> 11:13.933
What kind of father do you think I am?
They even got your birth date wrong.

11:14.040 --> 11:17.601
- That is my birthday.
- It's close to Christmas. Was that hard?

11:17.710 --> 11:22.704
It's a coincidence, Michael.
You're not N. Bluth. There is no N. Bluth.

11:22.815 --> 11:26.273
I called Jan Eagleman about this,
and she says it sounds pretty bad.

11:26.385 --> 11:29.684
- You called her? She's with the prosecution.
- Just for the mock trial.

11:29.789 --> 11:32.189
Yeah, but what if she wasn't?

11:32.291 --> 11:35.454
I am glad we're having this mock trial,
because it has shown me...

11:35.561 --> 11:38.621
that you cannot be involved
in the real defense.

11:38.731 --> 11:40.631
- Oh, come on.
- Why can't you be like Buster?

11:40.733 --> 11:45.966
He put himself in a coma
to protect this family, poor kid.

11:46.072 --> 11:48.632
- I gotta get down there now.
- Shrimp fest is over, Pop.

11:48.741 --> 11:52.199
Really?
Better go to Chili's.

11:52.311 --> 11:56.441
<i>Back at the hospital,
Lindsay had joined Brian in protest.</i>

11:56.549 --> 11:59.040
All they're doing in there
is trying to keep people alive.

11:59.151 --> 12:01.881
- It's a life mill.
- Oh, hello, Lindsay.

12:01.987 --> 12:05.081
I'd like to introduce you to a friend
of mine that I met at the gym.

12:05.191 --> 12:10.292
- Hi. I'm Father Ben. - Ben is a Franciscan
who can bench-press over 200 pounds.

12:10.396 --> 12:14.264
And he talked me into protesting too.
Show 'em your sign.

12:16.435 --> 12:18.335
No, the other side, 'cause that...

12:18.437 --> 12:21.463
Tobias, Brian and I believe in
the dignity of every human being.

12:21.574 --> 12:24.839
Now, why don't we leave the fruits with
the vegetables and go get a coffee?

12:24.944 --> 12:26.844
Do some pushups.

12:26.946 --> 12:29.471
<i>George Michael and Maeby
were also at the hospital...</i>

12:29.582 --> 12:33.177
<i>putting on a wedding
for the Alzheimer's patients.</i>

12:33.285 --> 12:36.584
And now, they are truly family.
It is permanent...

12:36.689 --> 12:38.919
eternal.

12:39.024 --> 12:41.788
<i>And Maeby did the thing
she had always thought was so corny...</i>

12:41.894 --> 12:44.362
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

12:44.463 --> 12:46.431
- But we're not...
- What am I doing?

12:46.532 --> 12:48.523
<i>And ran away.</i>

12:48.634 --> 12:50.534
What are we gonna do?

12:50.636 --> 12:53.332
Just give it a minute.

12:55.908 --> 12:59.036
Now it's a bar mitzvah.

12:59.145 --> 13:02.273
<i>And as George Michael
acted like a boy becoming a man...</i>

13:02.381 --> 13:05.782
<i>Michael returned to his office
to find a man acting like a boy.</i>

13:05.885 --> 13:09.343
- What's this?
- Just practicing my testimony. Fake witness box.

13:09.455 --> 13:12.856
And you couldn't have just taken my stuff
off the desk first or unplugged my computer?

13:12.958 --> 13:16.359
Justice is swift, Michael. Plus,
we need to be prepared for our testimony.

13:16.462 --> 13:20.626
You're not doing any of that
"My name is Judge" stuff on the stand, okay?

13:20.733 --> 13:23.896
No. They're all out of magazines at
the hospital. Besides, I've got a better idea.

13:24.003 --> 13:25.903
<i>Which he got at the hospital.</i>

13:26.005 --> 13:30.704
Patient presented with gastric bacterial
infection coupled with peptic ulcers.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.472
Tetracycline should not be
administered due to allergies.

13:33.579 --> 13:35.843
Check this out. You'll say,
"Who's this little friend?"

13:35.948 --> 13:38.439
And I'll say,
"Well, he's not really feeling that well."

13:38.551 --> 13:40.519
And you'll say,
"Oh, what's wrong with the little guy?"

13:40.619 --> 13:42.712
And he'll say...

13:42.822 --> 13:45.484
<i>Patient presented with
gastric bacterial infection.</i>

13:45.591 --> 13:49.994
Wow. Sounds like you
could use some try-cycling.

13:50.095 --> 13:52.188
<i>Tetracycline should not be
administered due to allergies.</i>

13:52.298 --> 13:56.564
Your lips are still moving, and...
You stole the doctor's tape recorder?

13:56.669 --> 13:58.330
- Just the tape.
- I'm giving it back to him.

13:58.437 --> 14:00.496
- Come on, Michael! - Gob...
- I need this!

14:00.606 --> 14:03.166
My career needs this.
You know what? Dad was right.

14:03.275 --> 14:06.108
If you really cared about this family,
you'd be more supportive of me in this.

14:06.212 --> 14:10.012
Gob, I'm not gonna turn
this mock trial into some kind of...

14:10.115 --> 14:13.346
- You were gonna say mockery.
- I was in trouble, like, three words into that.

14:13.452 --> 14:15.579
<i>So Michael went back to the hospital...</i>

14:15.688 --> 14:18.851
<i>when he had a visit
from the real prosecutor.</i>

14:18.958 --> 14:21.688
Wayne, what are you doin' here?

14:21.794 --> 14:24.194
- We heard about the trial. We wanna
make a deal with you. - A deal?

14:24.296 --> 14:26.526
- It's a mock trial.
- Read the Patriot Act.

14:26.632 --> 14:29.499
Anything said in a mock trial
or daytime courtroom show...

14:29.602 --> 14:33.129
can be used in any real criminal proceeding
or prime-time procedural show...

14:33.239 --> 14:36.697
subject to the interpretation of the
presiding judge or the executive producer.

14:36.809 --> 14:38.800
In our case, Judge Reinhold is both.

14:38.911 --> 14:40.378
- Did he get EP?
- Sure did.

14:40.479 --> 14:42.777
Good for him.
Anyway, put your dad on the stand...

14:42.882 --> 14:44.907
get him talking,
and you get full immunity.

14:45.017 --> 14:48.145
If you don't do it, we're gonna go after
N. Bluth, and we think that's you.

14:48.254 --> 14:51.587
You're asking me to conspire against my own
client. Couldn't you go to jail for that?

14:51.690 --> 14:56.491
- Think about it, Michael. It may be time to
cut and run. - We don't do that in my family.

15:03.335 --> 15:06.065
<i>Maeby had just
run away from a fake wedding...</i>

15:06.171 --> 15:08.867
<i>that had gotten a little too real.</i>

15:08.974 --> 15:12.637
- You know about this room too?
- Yeah, it's my dad's exercise room.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.213
<i>Although, for all her worldliness...</i>

15:15.314 --> 15:17.714
<i>Maeby was still
a child in many ways.</i>

15:17.816 --> 15:20.717
Yeah, I-I come here to think myself
sometimes. But I always knock first.

15:20.819 --> 15:23.686
I-I always do that. I always do that
anyway, no matter what room.

15:23.789 --> 15:26.758
- So what happened back there?
- I don't know.

15:26.859 --> 15:29.020
I guess I just got
a little weirded out.

15:29.128 --> 15:31.756
I mean, we're cousins.
It's wrong.

15:31.864 --> 15:33.798
Well, you know, the Torah tells us
that the larger wrong...

15:33.899 --> 15:36.390
is to put our own feelings
before the commitments we've made.

15:36.502 --> 15:38.402
You know, towards the sick,
aged and gross.

15:38.504 --> 15:40.836
<i>- That's not in the Torah.</i>
- And, I mean, you know...

15:40.940 --> 15:42.931
we weren't there
for ourselves today.

15:43.042 --> 15:45.636
We were there
to bring happiness to others.

15:45.744 --> 15:51.410
And I just... I just feel now like we left
a lot of old people sad there today.

15:51.517 --> 15:53.417
<i>Again, not true.</i>

15:58.490 --> 16:02.551
I mean, you know,
I'm not saying it's not weird for me too.

16:02.661 --> 16:06.324
I'm saying maybe we could take those weird
feelings and turn them into something positive.

16:06.432 --> 16:08.400
<i>He really wanted that kiss.</i>

16:08.500 --> 16:11.196
I mean, I guess it would be
a good way to freak out our parents.

16:11.303 --> 16:13.601
Let's freak them out.

16:13.706 --> 16:15.697
Hey, you guys know
about this room too, huh?

16:15.808 --> 16:19.767
I'm just lookin' for some evidence for
my trial against Pop-Pop... for Pop-Pop.

16:22.681 --> 16:25.115
I mean, seriously, Doctor,
when are we gonna know something?

16:25.217 --> 16:28.243
- I'm tryin' to get on with my life.
- So is what remains of Buster.

16:28.354 --> 16:30.549
Dr. Farmer,
there's a problem in 302.

16:30.656 --> 16:32.920
The patient's having a bad reaction
to the tetracycline.

16:33.025 --> 16:35.892
Tetracycline?
Didn't I say not to give him that?

16:35.995 --> 16:37.895
Didn't you listen to my notes?

16:42.668 --> 16:45.796
I'm trying to get on with my life,
and you know what? You can't deal with it.

16:45.904 --> 16:48.099
- No, I can't, Lindsay.
- You're not interested in me.

16:48.207 --> 16:51.176
- And you're not capable of intimacy.
- Well, just fake it!

16:52.544 --> 16:54.478
Coma.

16:54.580 --> 16:57.276
<i>And, believe it or not,
that actually got through to them.</i>

16:59.118 --> 17:02.747
Now, will you please turn on the Cartoon
Network and get the hell out of here?

17:02.855 --> 17:04.755
<i>And the next day...</i>

17:04.857 --> 17:07.723
<i>the mock trial began,
as did the mock episode...</i>

17:07.826 --> 17:09.817
<i>of what had
now been renamed...</i>

17:09.928 --> 17:11.828
- Mock Trial with J. Reinhold.
<i>- Mock Trial with J. Reinhold.</i>

17:11.930 --> 17:15.330
Take one.
In five, four, three...

17:25.743 --> 17:30.340
All rise for acting's highest honor,
Judge Reinhold!

17:30.449 --> 17:33.885
Judge Reinhold is neither a real judge,
nor has he received acting's highest honor.

17:35.621 --> 17:37.851
Wow. Thank you.

17:37.956 --> 17:41.357
That's the first time I ever got
a standing ovation before the show.

17:43.228 --> 17:45.492
- They're not clapping.
- They don't in a courtroom.

17:45.597 --> 17:48.031
Please be seated.f

17:48.133 --> 17:50.192
<i>The proceedings got under way...</i>

17:50.302 --> 17:54.295
<i>and the Bluths set about pretending
they were a family that stays together.</i>

17:54.406 --> 17:56.636
<i>You never heard anyone
in your family discuss plans...</i>

17:56.742 --> 17:59.939
to either travel to Iraq
or do business there?

18:00.045 --> 18:04.709
Well, I spend so much time
making sweet love on my wife...

18:04.817 --> 18:08.753
that it's hard to hear anything
over the clatter of her breasts and...

18:08.854 --> 18:10.985
- Your witness.
- I have nothing.

18:13.325 --> 18:15.759
Oh, how should I know
where the money comes from?

18:15.861 --> 18:21.163
I just know where it goes...
to taking care of my poor comatose son.

18:21.266 --> 18:24.099
And if this were the real trial,
I'd cry here.

18:24.203 --> 18:27.331
I'm saving my good stuff too.

18:27.439 --> 18:31.603
- I have no cross at this time.
- This is why you're not handling my real defense.

18:31.710 --> 18:33.610
I have one witness, Dad,
and he'll clear everything up.

18:33.712 --> 18:36.272
<i>- Gob had a little trouble.</i>
- State your name.

18:37.449 --> 18:39.349
<i>My name is Judge.</i>

18:39.451 --> 18:42.181
What kind of name is that, magazine?

18:42.287 --> 18:45.120
I'm just gonna go ahead and jump
in right here. I have nothing for him.

18:47.025 --> 18:49.255
<i>But now, it was Michael's turn.</i>

18:49.361 --> 18:51.261
Listen, have fun out there,
because this is the last time...

18:51.363 --> 18:55.094
you're gonna see this side of a courtroom till
your second wife divorces your freckled ass.

18:55.200 --> 18:57.361
Look at that.
You just blew your wedding speech.

18:57.469 --> 19:00.632
I'd like to jump right ahead
to calling a surprise witness.

19:00.739 --> 19:03.867
- Only witnesses on the list.
- Oh, he's on the list.

19:03.976 --> 19:07.639
I would like to call to the stand...

19:07.746 --> 19:11.045
Franklin Delano Bluth.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.778
- You're callin' Franklin, Mikey?
- I sure am, pal.

19:13.886 --> 19:16.719
I support my brother.

19:25.330 --> 19:27.890
Your Honor, this is highly unusual.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.060
Well, I'm very curious to see
where this is going. I'm gonna allow it.

19:31.170 --> 19:34.606
But I'm warning you, Mr. Bluth,
this better make for a good promo.

19:34.706 --> 19:37.937
I was approached by
the real prosecution recently...

19:38.043 --> 19:42.343
and was asked if I would be willing
to turn on my family and save myself.

19:42.447 --> 19:44.779
Would you please
press the play button...

19:44.883 --> 19:47.750
on the tape recorder
inside the puppet?

19:47.853 --> 19:50.879
<i>If you don't do it, we're gonna go
after N. Bluth, and we think that's you.</i>

19:50.989 --> 19:53.924
<i>You're asking me to conspire
against my own client.</i>

19:54.026 --> 19:56.085
Why do there have
to be puppets like Frank?

19:56.195 --> 19:59.426
<i>- Think about it, Michael.</i>
- Well, it looks like we've got a mistrial.

19:59.531 --> 20:03.627
But on the plus side,
we've also got a hung jury. Hit it!

20:12.744 --> 20:14.706
You did good out there, Michael.

20:14.813 --> 20:17.680
But it's just a mock trial.
Why don't you just take it to the grand jury?

20:17.783 --> 20:22.152
Wanted to prove to you that I could do it.
I'm going to a grand jury with that now.

20:22.254 --> 20:24.279
<i>Actually, Michael had no idea...</i>

20:24.389 --> 20:26.789
<i>that's what he was supposed to do.</i>

20:26.892 --> 20:30.020
Nice job. You have a real shot. You all
stuck together, and that's what wins cases.

20:30.128 --> 20:31.857
We don't abandon each other.

20:31.964 --> 20:35.297
- No one's closer than the Bluth family.
<i>- They were.</i>

20:35.400 --> 20:38.528
<i>I now pronounce you husband and wife.</i>

20:38.637 --> 20:43.006
<i>For as it turns out, the fake priest
was called to a patient's room...</i>

20:43.108 --> 20:46.942
<i>and Father Ben filled in,
not knowing it was fake.</i>

20:47.045 --> 20:49.479
<i>And that's how
the kids got married.</i>

20:49.581 --> 20:52.141
<i>On the next</i>
Arrested Development.

20:52.251 --> 20:55.584
Mock Trial with J. Reinhold
<i>leads to imitators.</i>

20:55.687 --> 20:57.587
<i>All rise.</i> Bud Cort <i>is now in session.</i>

20:57.689 --> 21:03.525
- Please be seated. - Hard to sit when
you got someone's hand up your ass.

21:03.629 --> 21:05.529
All right, let's lose the puppet.

21:05.631 --> 21:09.567
<i>And Michael discovers
that he wasn't N. Bluth after all.</i>

21:11.703 --> 21:13.762
<i>I have an older sister?</i>

21:13.872 --> 21:16.238
<i>So much for not abandoning family.</i>
