(mellow music playing)

01:04.533 --> 01:07.734
Oh, Rose. Good God.
My heart is still pounding.

01:07.800 --> 01:11.300
I was just in an accident.
But don't worry, I'm ok.

01:11.367 --> 01:14.934
Oh, thank God.
Any damage to your car?

01:15.000 --> 01:17.900
That's the one bright spot.
I had borrowed yours.

01:20.400 --> 01:23.467
My car? You didn't ask
if you could borrow my car.

01:23.533 --> 01:26.700
I guess we learned
not to leave keys on the table.

01:27.667 --> 01:30.433
I can't believe this. How did it happen?

01:30.500 --> 01:32.600
You know how I meet rich men

01:32.667 --> 01:35.800
by gently rear-ending expensive cars
at red lights?

01:36.633 --> 01:39.600
-Yeah.
-You don't approve?

01:39.667 --> 01:41.767
Rose, it's the perfect plan.

01:41.834 --> 01:44.400
You meet the guy, exchange addresses,

01:44.467 --> 01:48.433
then when he asks about good body work,
you give him your phone number.

01:52.166 --> 01:55.367
-And this really works?
-Well, not this time.

01:55.433 --> 01:58.767
I had this cute guy in a jag lined up

01:58.834 --> 02:02.000
when this dork in a duster
cut in front of me...

02:03.333 --> 02:05.266
and I nicked him instead.

02:05.533 --> 02:07.266
Blanche, I am furious.

02:07.333 --> 02:09.233
First you take my car without asking,

02:09.300 --> 02:13.800
and then you show complete disregard
for my personal property.

02:13.867 --> 02:18.000
Rose, please have a little compassion.
I was just in an accident.

02:18.066 --> 02:21.233
What should I do,
carry you to your room?

02:22.367 --> 02:26.667
-Massage your neck? Make some cocoa?
-Diet cocoa. I'm going out again tomorrow.

02:31.734 --> 02:34.700
-Blanche.
-Hi, Dorothy, how was the funeral?

02:34.767 --> 02:37.967
It was a humdinger, Blanche.
We closed the place.

02:40.500 --> 02:43.500
-Where's Sophia?
-She's taking this pretty hard.

02:43.567 --> 02:46.767
She needs some time
by herself in the car.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.133
We'll really have to be there for ma.

02:49.200 --> 02:52.033
Oh, Dorothy, Sophia's
like my own mother.

02:52.100 --> 02:55.300
Until she feels better,
I'll won't think about anything else.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.333
My car!

02:59.433 --> 03:00.500
It's ruined!

03:00.567 --> 03:03.500
It's just a little scratch.
I could live with it.

03:03.567 --> 03:07.300
-What did you do?
-Do we have to do this now?

03:07.567 --> 03:10.467
A nun has died. More than a nun.

03:10.533 --> 03:13.266
Sister Agnes was my mother's best friend.

03:13.867 --> 03:15.266
She's out there alone now.

03:15.333 --> 03:17.934
She hasn't said a word
since leaving the cemetery.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.533
I have no idea how she's
going to react to this.

03:23.233 --> 03:24.600
I've made a decision.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.266
I'm going to become a nun.

03:32.500 --> 03:34.200
Well, at least now you know.

03:39.233 --> 03:40.800
Ma, what are you talking about?

03:40.867 --> 03:43.900
God spoke to me.
He told me to join the order.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.233
God spoke to you?

03:47.300 --> 03:50.000
You haven't been eating
chili dogs again, have you?

03:52.100 --> 03:53.433
That was an honest mistake.

03:53.500 --> 03:56.867
That's when I
thought God was whistling to me.

03:58.367 --> 04:00.633
-This was him talking.
-Oh, Ma.

04:00.700 --> 04:03.834
This sounds crazy, but it really happened.

04:03.900 --> 04:05.834
-I don't believe you.
-God said you'd say that.

04:05.900 --> 04:08.567
-Ma!
-That, too.

04:08.633 --> 04:10.500
-Ma, stop this.
-Three for three.

04:12.633 --> 04:15.333
This is ridiculous.
You don't want to be a nun.

04:15.400 --> 04:16.800
Yes, I do, Dorothy.

04:16.867 --> 04:22.033
God reminded me about my dream,
a very private dream I never talked about.

04:22.100 --> 04:25.100
When I was growing up,
I wanted to join the convent.

04:25.166 --> 04:27.333
Well, until I was 17.

04:28.834 --> 04:32.200
-What happened then?
-Your father put his hand in my blouse.

04:35.066 --> 04:38.500
-So?
-So I felt soiled, filthy, dirty...

04:38.900 --> 04:40.433
you know, in love.

04:42.700 --> 04:47.000
But this time, I'll fulfill my destiny.
This time, I'm going to become a nun.

04:50.700 --> 04:52.633
Do you believe what we just heard?

04:52.700 --> 04:55.333
I can't believe anybody
would want to be a nun.

04:55.967 --> 04:58.867
I mean, nun...the word says it.

05:02.467 --> 05:08.800
(serene music playing)

05:11.667 --> 05:13.166
Well, you're not going to believe this.

05:13.567 --> 05:17.567
I was talking on the phone for a half-hour
and guess what?

05:17.633 --> 05:19.166
You forgot to dial first?

05:24.767 --> 05:25.867
No.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.633
You held the receiver upside-down.

05:29.734 --> 05:33.834
-Uh-uh.
-It was the TV remote control?

05:34.834 --> 05:36.700
-No.
-A shoe?

05:37.834 --> 05:42.900
Blanche, please. I'm not an idiot.
The TV has a remote control?

05:45.533 --> 05:48.667
-This could be kind of important.
-What?

05:48.734 --> 05:51.667
Remember Mr. Nivingston?
The guy whose rear end you smacked?

05:54.100 --> 05:56.100
Well, my insurance company just called.

05:56.166 --> 05:58.300
He's claiming he's hurt,

05:58.367 --> 06:00.834
and he's threatening a lawsuit
unless we settle.

06:00.900 --> 06:02.367
Oh, that's terrible!

06:02.433 --> 06:05.500
I'm the one he's suing
because it's my car.

06:05.567 --> 06:08.934
Oh! Oh. Oh, Rose.

06:10.133 --> 06:12.700
Boy, you had me going there for a second.

06:13.500 --> 06:16.033
I thought he was suing me. Whoo!

06:17.834 --> 06:19.000
What?

06:19.967 --> 06:24.500
Blanche, Rose might go to court
for something you did. Don't you care?

06:24.567 --> 06:28.867
Dorothy, there's nothing to worry about.
He's holding up his insurance company.

06:28.934 --> 06:31.734
-There's nothing wrong with him.
-How can you tell?

06:31.800 --> 06:35.934
I know the crooked walk of man
when his back is injured.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.133
I can't tell you how many men have limped
out of my bedroom.

06:44.533 --> 06:47.500
Shoulders stooped and their backs curved.

06:48.266 --> 06:50.867
Blanche, that's different. That's shame.

06:54.133 --> 06:56.633
(calm music playing)

06:56.700 --> 06:58.433
(doorbell rings)

07:03.600 --> 07:06.300
Sister Claire, how nice to see you.
Come in.

07:06.367 --> 07:08.700
Dorothy, this is sister Claire.

07:09.367 --> 07:12.633
She interviewed me about joining
her order. Please, sit down.

07:12.700 --> 07:16.934
Ma, you actually went to a convent?
Why didn't I know?

07:17.000 --> 07:18.500
Because you're divorced.

07:18.567 --> 07:21.033
Technically, in the eyes of the church,
you don't even exist.

07:24.734 --> 07:25.934
I spit on you.

07:28.300 --> 07:31.033
Unless the sister would
like to spit on you first.

07:33.033 --> 07:34.500
I'm her daughter Dorothy.

07:34.834 --> 07:35.934
You'll have to excuse my mother.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.600
She suffered a slight stroke
which rendered her totally annoying.

07:42.200 --> 07:45.567
-And what brings you here?
-The follow-up interview.

07:45.867 --> 07:49.100
We have very strict guidelines
when selecting postulants.

07:49.166 --> 07:52.467
We're going to put Sophia through some
psychological tests.

07:52.867 --> 07:55.467
It helps weed out the crazies
and undesirables.

07:55.533 --> 07:56.800
Sorry, Ma.

07:59.200 --> 08:02.700
Rose is trying to blame this thing on me.

08:02.767 --> 08:05.066
That woman has one hell of a lot of nerve.

08:10.033 --> 08:11.033
Hello.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.200
I'm a Baptist.

08:16.333 --> 08:17.367
Excuse me.

08:23.133 --> 08:26.767
Sister, is it all right if I sit in?
My mother wouldn't mind.

08:26.834 --> 08:27.967
Think again.

08:29.367 --> 08:34.934
I'd go outside, but there don't seem
to be any shady pines to sit under.

08:36.900 --> 08:38.300
Pillow, pussycat?

08:40.166 --> 08:42.200
We'll start with the ink blots.

08:42.266 --> 08:45.266
Uh, who was a 1950s
black singing group?

08:50.533 --> 08:53.200
Am I right? Am I in? Am I a nun yet?

08:53.934 --> 08:57.233
-She watches a lot of <i>Jeopardy!</i>
-No, no.

08:57.834 --> 09:00.867
You look at these
and tell me what you see.

09:00.934 --> 09:05.867
It's used by psychologists,
but we find it useful in our work, too.

09:06.400 --> 09:09.734
Now, what do you see?

09:09.800 --> 09:10.967
I see an angel.

09:12.266 --> 09:15.233
Very good. How about this one?

09:15.300 --> 09:18.767
-I see a dove perched upon God's throne.
-Excellent.

09:19.266 --> 09:22.834
-And this?
-I see the blessed mother smiling sweetly

09:22.900 --> 09:25.934
as she pours love upon the hearts
of the righteous,

09:26.000 --> 09:29.033
-standing at heaven's gates, while--
-Ma!

09:30.533 --> 09:32.834
-Come on. You're making that up.
-I am not!

09:32.900 --> 09:36.633
Anyone can clearly see
that's a picture of John Forsythe

09:36.700 --> 09:39.500
lying naked in a pool of honey.

09:44.500 --> 09:45.600
Isn't it?

09:47.233 --> 09:49.200
Do you think I'd lie about this?

09:49.266 --> 09:52.533
It does look a little like John Forsythe,
doesn't it?

09:54.133 --> 09:58.333
I'm sorry you made this trip for nothing.
But this has gone far enough.

09:58.400 --> 10:01.900
Ma, I cannot believe
that you actually want this.

10:01.967 --> 10:06.934
Look, I had a beautiful experience.
God called me, and I intend to answer.

10:07.567 --> 10:09.867
You're really serious about this,
aren't you?

10:09.934 --> 10:13.400
This means a lot to me.
I couldn't leave you that easily.

10:13.467 --> 10:15.467
A minute ago,
you were going to spit on me.

10:16.800 --> 10:19.133
Do you have this much
trouble with your kids?

10:22.166 --> 10:26.533
(calm music playing)

10:27.367 --> 10:30.066
-What's wrong, Rose?
-It's my insurance company.

10:30.533 --> 10:34.367
They've cut me off because of the lawsuit.
What am I going to do?

10:34.433 --> 10:36.467
You need a good lawyer.

10:36.533 --> 10:40.533
Give me the keys to your rental,
and I'll see if I can nail one for you.

10:42.633 --> 10:47.433
That's how you got me in trouble.
Can't you do anything else?

10:47.500 --> 10:50.800
We could prove Mr. Nivingston
was faking his injury

10:50.867 --> 10:54.934
if we could trick him into performing
certain acts of a sexual nature.

10:56.867 --> 10:59.533
All we'd need is
a devastatingly beautiful woman

10:59.600 --> 11:01.100
with a flair for seduction.

11:02.400 --> 11:04.800
How about Mrs. Hufstad down the street?

11:06.600 --> 11:10.066
I mean, she's something of a dog,
but she'll do it with anybody.

11:12.033 --> 11:15.100
-I was talking about me.
-Oh, yeah, you will, too.

11:17.567 --> 11:19.567
Rose, I won't go all the way.

11:19.633 --> 11:23.800
I'll get him in the bedroom
and put him through the normal warm-ups...

11:24.266 --> 11:26.567
and we'll have a certain
Scandinavian nitwit

11:26.633 --> 11:28.600
hiding in the closet with a camera.

11:29.900 --> 11:33.200
Wouldn't it be better
if I hid in the closet?

11:36.033 --> 11:37.700
Yes, Rose, I suppose it would.

11:38.767 --> 11:42.333
-Can you get him to remove the neck brace?
-Oh, please.

11:42.400 --> 11:45.333
I once got a man
to crawl out of a full body cast.

11:47.834 --> 11:51.834
-Well, I'm almost ready to go.
-Today? You're not going today!

11:51.900 --> 11:55.834
-Why didn't you tell us?
-You always try to talk me out of it.

11:55.900 --> 11:58.767
We were being selfish.
We didn't want to lose you.

11:58.834 --> 12:01.200
-(horn honks)
-There's my ride.

12:02.433 --> 12:05.400
Yup. It's a Granada full of nuns.

12:06.600 --> 12:11.100
Sophia, you have no idea
how much we'll miss you.

12:11.533 --> 12:13.133
It's like losing family.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.767
Rose is right.
You're just like our mother.

12:15.834 --> 12:19.066
-We feel like your daughters.
-I feel the same way.

12:19.133 --> 12:22.300
Rose, you're smarter
than people say you are.

12:22.367 --> 12:24.967
You've got common sense,
and you know what you're doing.

12:25.033 --> 12:26.734
Oh, Sophia.

12:28.667 --> 12:30.433
Blanche, you're a slut.

12:37.467 --> 12:39.433
Oh, Sophia.

12:41.433 --> 12:43.433
-(horn honks)
-Well, I better go.

12:43.500 --> 12:45.533
Nuns don't keep well in a hot car.

12:47.934 --> 12:50.433
We'll tell them you're on your way.

12:52.734 --> 12:54.433
I guess this is it.

12:54.500 --> 12:59.367
I'm just sorry it took me so long
to realize how much this meant to you.

12:59.934 --> 13:02.433
It's just very hard for me to let go.

13:02.500 --> 13:04.834
Me, too.
But someone else needs me more.

13:04.900 --> 13:08.000
It's time to move on.
My job here is done.

13:08.066 --> 13:10.667
I love it when you talk
like the lone ranger.

13:13.200 --> 13:18.200
Ma, I support your decision.
You'll make a great nun.

13:18.266 --> 13:20.467
Thanks. I needed to hear that.

13:20.934 --> 13:23.800
-I love you, Ma.
-I love you, too, tonto.

13:25.900 --> 13:32.100
(serene music playing)

13:34.467 --> 13:36.066
Careful, Arthur. Watch your step.

13:38.400 --> 13:41.433
-Blanche, if I only could.
-Oh, forgive me, sugar.

13:41.500 --> 13:44.166
Here, I'll watch it for you,
you poor thing.

13:44.767 --> 13:45.767
Thank you, Blanche.

13:46.166 --> 13:49.100
I can't believe how nice you are,
even though I'm suing your friend.

13:49.800 --> 13:54.667
I've always been attracted
to ever so slightly younger men.

13:55.500 --> 13:58.400
Besides, just look at you.

13:59.367 --> 14:02.233
It must be so frustrating
for an athlete like you.

14:03.200 --> 14:06.000
-Did you ever play any college ball?
-No.

14:06.333 --> 14:10.233
I got as far as the pee wee leagues,
but then I discovered stamps.

14:10.300 --> 14:11.400
Wow!

14:13.066 --> 14:18.533
You know, when I first saw you,
I said to myself, "philatelist."

14:19.700 --> 14:23.033
I like that. Ooh, you're getting so tense.

14:23.867 --> 14:27.233
How about if we go to my bedroom
to see if we can't loosen you up?

14:27.300 --> 14:28.400
Oh, I'm not sure.

14:28.467 --> 14:31.100
My lawyer, I mean my doctor,
I get them mixed up.

14:31.166 --> 14:32.633
They're in the same mall.

14:33.967 --> 14:37.900
You forget about that doctor.
I know about physical therapy myself.

14:37.967 --> 14:40.700
-I'm sure you do, but--
-If it'll make you feel better,

14:40.767 --> 14:43.934
I have a complete
nurse's outfit hanging in my closet.

14:45.900 --> 14:47.800
I've got to tell you,
that does make me feel better.

14:49.400 --> 14:52.567
What else have you got?
Oh!

14:52.633 --> 14:55.500
Wait! What am I doing?
I can't play nursey.

14:55.567 --> 14:58.500
-I'm supposed to have whiplash.
-If we can't be together soon,

14:58.567 --> 15:00.033
I'll have to go with somebody else.

15:00.100 --> 15:03.066
I haven't had a man since my husband died
nine years ago.

15:03.133 --> 15:05.233
I'm ready to explode.

15:05.967 --> 15:09.467
See you tomorrow, Blanche.
This is really beginning to chafe.

15:14.700 --> 15:16.800
-Were you able to get him to bed?
-No.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.367
Is Rose still in the closet
with the camera?

15:19.433 --> 15:20.467
Yes.

15:21.900 --> 15:24.100
-Maybe you'll get him tomorrow.
-Yeah.

15:26.066 --> 15:29.367
(mellow music playing)

15:30.166 --> 15:32.967
Hi, Rose. Out of the closet, I see.

15:33.533 --> 15:36.867
-Yeah, I'm back.
-I got a card from ma.

15:36.934 --> 15:38.767
Read it out loud.

15:38.834 --> 15:43.600
"Dear pussycat, I have everything I need
but it's hard to get a decent bikini wax.

15:45.834 --> 15:50.300
Dorothy, I remember you fondly.
And the same goes for Blanche and Rita.

15:52.967 --> 15:53.967
Wish you were here.

15:54.033 --> 15:59.333
No one can reach the third shelf
in the pantry. Best, sister Ma."

16:00.867 --> 16:02.600
I miss that woman.

16:03.233 --> 16:07.066
Say what you want, we loved having her.

16:07.133 --> 16:10.033
I miss someone to have
a chat with at midnight.

16:10.100 --> 16:12.734
You know what I'll miss most?

16:13.000 --> 16:14.967
The way she used to tease me.

16:15.266 --> 16:20.934
The way she would subtly jab me with names
like tramp...

16:22.600 --> 16:23.600
floozy...

16:24.667 --> 16:28.166
trollop, harlot, magic carpet ride.

16:29.767 --> 16:31.567
The human luge.

16:32.633 --> 16:36.633
She was never cuter than when she simply
called you shore leave.

16:40.066 --> 16:42.033
God, I miss her.

16:43.734 --> 16:49.700
(calm music playing)

16:59.000 --> 17:00.567
Ok, is everybody in?

17:01.367 --> 17:04.767
-I got a pair of jacks.
-Oh, wait, Sophia.

17:05.200 --> 17:10.333
I have a 2, 7, jack, 10,
and that's right, a 4.

17:10.400 --> 17:13.667
-That doesn't beat a pair of jacks.
-It did when you had it.

17:16.367 --> 17:19.300
I told you. That's called a whizzer.
It's only good once a night.

17:20.533 --> 17:22.867
I'll put this in the collection box later.

17:24.033 --> 17:26.100
-Sophia!
-Clear out. It's the man.

17:29.600 --> 17:30.734
Hello, reverend mother.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.900
My, you look holier-than-thou today.

17:34.667 --> 17:36.433
Save it, sister suck up.

17:38.166 --> 17:41.567
How do you explain this note I found
in the suggestion box?

17:41.633 --> 17:45.367
I thought that would be a good fund
raiser.

17:45.433 --> 17:48.967
A beefcake calendar
of monks of the Midwest?

17:50.200 --> 17:52.200
Oh, come on, open up your mind.

17:53.367 --> 17:58.133
Sophia, I'm going to go pray.
I won't say what I'm going to pray for.

17:58.200 --> 18:00.166
It would hurt your feelings.

18:00.233 --> 18:03.967
When I'm done,
I expect a complete change of attitude.

18:04.033 --> 18:05.200
Understand?

18:06.300 --> 18:07.834
Ooh, I'm so scared.

18:07.900 --> 18:10.700
What is she going to do,
take away my self-denial privileges?

18:13.567 --> 18:17.567
-Ma!
-Pussycat, what are you doing here?

18:17.633 --> 18:21.300
I missed you and wanted to say hi
and see how you're doing.

18:21.367 --> 18:23.867
I'm doing fine. 10 days celibate.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
Same here.

18:30.100 --> 18:31.900
Ma, I have a little surprise for you.

18:32.400 --> 18:33.567
Girls?

18:35.834 --> 18:37.867
Look who it is.

18:38.533 --> 18:41.300
It's Blanche and Rose.
Where's the surprise?

18:42.567 --> 18:45.633
Honey, we're your surprise.
We came to see you.

18:45.700 --> 18:49.433
What a lovely surprise.
Welcome to our little convent.

18:50.233 --> 18:51.934
Not even a Bundt cake, huh?

18:53.667 --> 18:56.266
Look at you. A nun!

18:56.867 --> 18:58.533
I didn't think I'd be shocked like this.

18:58.600 --> 19:02.633
You look so different
than when Blanche is dressed as a nun.

19:05.233 --> 19:07.433
So, what's new at home?

19:07.500 --> 19:11.033
I got a chance to go into your bedroom.

19:11.100 --> 19:14.367
I won't be able to refund
your cleaning deposit.

19:14.433 --> 19:15.867
Totally understandable.

19:16.533 --> 19:18.934
I'll see you in court, my child.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.233
Sophia.

19:21.600 --> 19:23.367
Mother superior,
this is my daughter Dorothy

19:23.433 --> 19:25.433
-and my ex-roommates.
-Hello.

19:26.367 --> 19:28.800
Sophia, why don't you run along?

19:28.867 --> 19:32.233
-I need to talk to your daughter alone.
-Sure.

19:32.300 --> 19:34.500
Whatever she says, I have an alibi.

19:37.166 --> 19:40.834
So, Dorothy, I bet you love your mother
a lot.

19:40.900 --> 19:43.200
That depends. What has she done?

19:45.300 --> 19:48.300
It's not necessarily anything specific.

19:48.700 --> 19:52.200
It's my feeling that life here
is too structured for her.

19:52.266 --> 19:54.133
I'm afraid I don't follow you.

19:54.200 --> 19:58.033
She is a stubborn, old, vindictive,
pack mule of a woman

19:58.100 --> 19:59.734
who won't follow the rules.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.467
Ok, I'm back with you.

20:03.700 --> 20:06.400
I think her intentions are good...

20:06.767 --> 20:09.266
but this doesn't seem to be her calling.

20:09.333 --> 20:13.133
This means so much to her.
This would break her heart.

20:13.200 --> 20:16.867
I'm sorry,
but I'm going to have to ask her to leave.

20:16.934 --> 20:20.600
Mother superior, with your permission,
may I tell her?

20:21.000 --> 20:22.400
We've been through so much.

20:22.467 --> 20:27.200
Bad news would be easier to take
if it came from me.

20:27.767 --> 20:30.467
Well, then, here's another one for you.

20:30.767 --> 20:34.767
We've seen her room. She's not getting her
cleaning deposit back.

20:37.066 --> 20:40.367
(serene music playing)

20:40.433 --> 20:43.467
God, I'm so confused.
I don't know where I belong.

20:43.533 --> 20:47.033
I'm wrestling with deep religious
questions of the ages.

20:47.667 --> 20:50.200
Like, what do you want from me?

20:50.266 --> 20:52.266
What is my real purpose?

20:52.734 --> 20:55.767
What was Edward G. Robinson doing
in <i>The Ten Commandments?</i>

20:56.633 --> 20:58.000
(knock on door)

21:11.100 --> 21:12.166
Come in.

21:14.834 --> 21:16.633
Ma, where are Blanche and Rose?

21:16.700 --> 21:18.734
Oh, they wanted to browse
in the gift shop.

21:18.800 --> 21:21.533
There's a sale on John the Baptist
place mats.

21:22.233 --> 21:26.100
Do you remember when I didn't get
into girl scout camp

21:26.166 --> 21:29.500
and you said we would have more
fun than anyone?

21:29.567 --> 21:31.667
-They want me out.
-Yesterday.

21:34.367 --> 21:37.867
I don't get it.
God wants my life to be meaningful.

21:37.934 --> 21:39.967
That won't happen unless I'm here.

21:40.033 --> 21:42.767
Ma, your life is meaningful.

21:43.200 --> 21:45.767
You do nothing but help other people.

21:45.834 --> 21:50.166
You do meals on wheels,
red cross, volunteer hospital work.

21:50.233 --> 21:54.834
You don't have to be in a convent
to make your life meaningful.

21:54.900 --> 21:57.967
Sister Agnes belonged here, but you don't.

21:58.633 --> 22:02.567
-Who's going to take sister Agnes' place?
-Nobody can take her place.

22:02.934 --> 22:05.233
Just like nobody can take your place.

22:05.767 --> 22:08.000
-I miss her.
-I know.

22:09.467 --> 22:11.567
-Let's go home.
-All right.

22:12.333 --> 22:15.633
But I'll be missing movie night.
But, so what?

22:15.700 --> 22:19.567
After the 10th time,
it isn't the greatest story ever told.

22:21.700 --> 22:25.734
(mellow music playing)

22:29.133 --> 22:30.533
Here you go, Ma.

22:33.700 --> 22:35.333
I guess it's going to take you a little
while

22:35.400 --> 22:38.767
to get adjusted to being
home from the convent.

22:39.066 --> 22:41.767
Actually, it isn't that much different.

22:41.834 --> 22:44.133
-Whoa!
-Give me that film!

22:44.200 --> 22:47.500
Go, Rose, go! Run!

22:54.700 --> 22:56.233
Good to have you home, Ma.

23:04.133 --> 23:08.867
(theme music playing)
