00:01.600 --> 00:03.940
I saw it.

00:04.600 --> 00:06.440
You're not grown up yet?

00:10.820 --> 00:14.280
Oh? It looks like you're not changed a bit!

00:15.450 --> 00:17.160
Kenny!

00:20.870 --> 00:22.290
Boom!

02:02.970 --> 02:07.980
"Dolore"

02:08.850 --> 02:09.680
Of the shots ?!

02:11.980 --> 02:13.070
What is going on?!

02:13.070 --> 02:14.270
Stay inside! Hiyaah!

02:23.080 --> 02:23.830
History!

02:31.460 --> 02:32.210
They were!

02:35.550 --> 02:36.230
à¤ƒiyah!

02:50.310 --> 02:54.020
Shit! They have planned to the last of our movements!

03:03.120 --> 03:06.740
Kenny ... What the hell is doing with the military police ?!

03:26.100 --> 03:28.560
Is Levi ... Scouts!

03:28.560 --> 03:30.640
Welcome to our bar!

03:30.980 --> 03:32.080
Oooh!

03:32.690 --> 03:37.300
Shit ... If this continues, I will lose my team, Eren and even Historia.

03:37.650 --> 03:38.480
Tsk!

03:38.480 --> 03:43.490
I'll be damned! I smell disgusting rat come from this bar ...

03:43.740 --> 03:46.010
Come out, little rodent ...

03:46.490 --> 03:48.410
Found!

03:48.410 --> 03:51.250
The law has come to exterminate the pests!

03:51.250 --> 03:52.940
Bang! Bang!

03:54.080 --> 03:54.960
Eeh!

03:56.840 --> 03:59.880
What the hell?! You are not here?!

03:59.880 --> 04:02.260
Here behind, Kenny. It's been a while.

04:02.880 --> 04:05.390
I never thought that I was still alive.

04:05.390 --> 04:09.260
What happened to slaughter the Military Police? Now you're one of them?

04:09.260 --> 04:13.140
The adults do things a child like you can not understand.

04:13.140 --> 04:14.850
Oops, perdonami...

04:14.850 --> 04:18.570
You are so low that it's hard to believe you're grown up since then.

04:19.779 --> 04:22.900
I can not wait to see you in action.

04:22.900 --> 04:27.570
I never thought that all the tricks I taught you would help you in a situation like this.

04:28.530 --> 04:32.080
Have I told you what happens to a mouse with their backs to the wall?

04:32.910 --> 04:37.580
No matter which way you try to run, it will always be crushed from above.

04:38.500 --> 04:40.260
Hey, Levi ...

04:43.880 --> 04:48.820
There must be a reason why you became a scout, and I think I know why.

04:49.720 --> 04:52.640
In that dump we had no choice but to survive.

04:53.100 --> 04:55.780
We had to commit all our forces every day to keep on living.

04:56.480 --> 05:02.290
And when we found out how big the world out, you can bet that he made a bad dog ...

05:03.190 --> 05:05.630
But something has saved us ...

05:06.160 --> 05:10.050
We knew we had to do something. It was simple.

05:10.530 --> 05:12.340
It is simple, but the truth is that ...

05:12.340 --> 05:15.910
the only thing that made our lives satisfying has been to find a hobby.

05:16.330 --> 05:21.670
Hobby? So you're blasting heads to my team as a hobby?

05:21.670 --> 05:26.430
Yeah ... To achieve my goals, I will kill as much as necessary.

05:26.840 --> 05:30.300
You have not changed. Even if you kill makes you comfortable.

05:30.300 --> 05:31.200
Yup...

05:35.560 --> 05:36.230
Wait up!

05:36.890 --> 05:37.720
Captain...

05:38.480 --> 05:40.480
Thank you, old man.

05:46.650 --> 05:47.450
A SEDIA ?!

05:53.450 --> 05:53.950
What?!

05:53.950 --> 05:55.200
-Fire! -What?!

06:02.670 --> 06:03.420
Shooting!

06:03.800 --> 06:04.420
Eh?

06:04.420 --> 06:05.360
Da li!

06:06.670 --> 06:08.320
I heard a lot of shots!

06:10.470 --> 06:12.190
Do you think something is happening?

06:12.550 --> 06:13.650
Probably.

06:14.970 --> 06:16.850
The Captain had this message for us ...

06:17.270 --> 06:21.680
"From now on, we will fight even human, and not just the Giants."

06:22.480 --> 06:23.980
Eh? You mean...?

06:24.570 --> 06:25.320
Hey!

06:26.400 --> 06:27.040
Hmm?

06:28.700 --> 06:30.890
It was someone from the First Internal Team?

06:31.410 --> 06:34.500
Commander. Must check some documents.

06:37.790 --> 06:38.500
Captain.

06:39.420 --> 06:40.750
He eventually left us the bucket?

06:41.670 --> 06:45.590
Idiot ... How could I answer that if I died?

06:45.880 --> 06:48.900
Ouch ouch ouch ... I was surprised.

06:49.300 --> 06:53.970
I forgot that the bar owners are allowed to keep guns for protection ...

06:54.300 --> 06:56.680
For a little guy, he has certainly grown.

06:57.100 --> 06:58.270
Magnificent.

06:58.270 --> 07:00.480
Eh ?! What the hell you say!

07:00.940 --> 07:03.730
My dream is going further and further away ...

07:09.110 --> 07:10.490
Hey! Here Eren!

07:12.280 --> 07:12.990
Captain!

07:17.950 --> 07:18.790
What the hell?!

07:30.340 --> 07:31.300
Chase the wagon!

07:32.380 --> 07:33.050
Yes, sir!

07:34.760 --> 07:35.390
Hear!

07:35.390 --> 07:37.680
I'm used to fighting other people!

07:37.680 --> 07:39.220
They have already made out three of our.

07:40.270 --> 07:43.440
If you ask to get those two back, you do not hesitate!

07:43.440 --> 07:45.860
If you get a chance, kill! I got it?!

07:47.020 --> 07:47.780
Roger!

07:53.820 --> 07:54.460
Tsk!

07:54.910 --> 07:57.700
Armin, Jean! Protect the wagon! We'll cover!

07:58.490 --> 07:59.330
Yessir!

07:59.330 --> 08:00.580
Another dead ...

08:00.580 --> 08:01.750
Jean!

08:07.800 --> 08:08.800
Do not move!

08:12.220 --> 08:13.050
Your...

08:19.770 --> 08:20.310
Jean!

08:26.940 --> 08:31.940
"Currently undisclosed information" "Mechanism of Anti Maneuver Dimensional Man"

08:26.940 --> 08:31.940
"This device is not designed to exterminate the Giants but to counter the equipment of the scouts: With the speed that exceeds human perception and the ability to attack the blind spots, this device shows its superiority in both cities and in forests" .

08:32.360 --> 08:36.320
"Mitras (Capitale)"

08:35.570 --> 08:38.460
What a disappointment that we have not discovered anything to Erwin.

08:39.080 --> 08:42.360
We do not know the location of Eren Jaeger and Historia.

08:42.789 --> 08:46.960
At this rate, the freezing of the activities of the scouts will prove futile.

08:47.250 --> 08:48.250
Indeed...

08:48.250 --> 08:51.700
We know what information might have learned from Pastor Nick?

08:52.510 --> 08:53.640
There are clues.

08:54.010 --> 08:59.390
And if we ask too much, we will reveal them things they did not know in the first place.

08:59.390 --> 09:02.220
No, what they know or do not know it does not matter.

09:02.560 --> 09:05.560
What matters is that they have tried to learn. This is enough.

09:06.060 --> 09:08.670
We should deal with them as the law commands.

09:09.020 --> 09:11.070
Just as we have done so far ...

09:16.740 --> 09:18.000
It comes from Lord Reiss.

09:21.540 --> 09:23.450
Eren and Historia were captured.

09:24.120 --> 09:27.710
It has already moved against Erwin and the regiment of scouts.

09:28.250 --> 09:30.340
It is not necessary that we act.

09:32.670 --> 09:34.210
This is the last.

09:34.510 --> 09:37.340
If you want your belongings back, ask later.

09:37.590 --> 09:38.930
No, it's okay.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.260
I was hoping to talk to you.

09:42.770 --> 09:45.310
Not in the mood to remember the past.

09:45.310 --> 09:47.020
How cold you are, Nile.

09:47.140 --> 09:49.730
We were comrades who were intended to be scout?

09:52.020 --> 09:54.570
This little world is about to change.

09:55.070 --> 09:56.950
It will bring hope or despair?

09:57.450 --> 10:00.950
Can we trust the government for the future of humanity or not?

10:01.370 --> 10:02.280
Who can choose?

10:03.290 --> 10:04.430
Who will decide?

10:05.120 --> 10:07.290
Who would you trust?

10:08.420 --> 10:12.210
Erwin, you ... What are you going to do?

10:14.300 --> 10:16.520
I bet, as I always do.

10:26.850 --> 10:28.570
You spent all this too?

10:33.820 --> 10:34.980
Sorry...

10:34.980 --> 10:35.660
All right.

10:36.150 --> 10:38.630
Sorry, sorry ...

10:52.330 --> 10:54.000
Merda! Armin! Jeans!

11:08.520 --> 11:10.620
Do not do it! Withdraw!

11:15.520 --> 11:18.400
They were!

11:25.370 --> 11:26.220
What's wrong?

11:26.910 --> 11:28.830
This messy place makes you move your appetite?

11:29.330 --> 11:30.120
No...

11:30.790 --> 11:33.960
Jean, is there anything you do not understand ...

11:34.670 --> 11:35.540
What?

11:36.340 --> 11:38.810
When I fired to save ...

11:39.650 --> 11:42.010
I honestly thought he had not done in time.

11:42.470 --> 11:44.590
I'm sorry but...

11:45.350 --> 11:47.580
because it was me who shot first?

11:52.480 --> 11:53.460
Because...

11:54.190 --> 11:56.490
Because the other person hesitated.

11:57.320 --> 11:58.190
This is the truth.

11:59.990 --> 12:04.200
Armin, I'm sorry ... I should have done what had to be done.

12:04.660 --> 12:06.660
I know what it is ...

12:07.370 --> 12:11.790
The person who killed ... I bet he was a good person.

12:12.620 --> 12:15.550
Someone who was much more human than me ...

12:16.420 --> 12:19.590
I pulled the trigger so easily ... I did ...

12:20.590 --> 12:21.250
I'm...

12:21.970 --> 12:25.320
Armin, you've got blood on his hands now.

12:25.890 --> 12:27.830
You can not go back.

12:28.560 --> 12:30.020
Why do you say this?

12:30.020 --> 12:32.040
You have to accept it.

12:33.060 --> 12:36.060
Think, if your hands were still clean ...

12:36.960 --> 12:39.070
Jean would not be here now.

12:43.150 --> 12:48.330
I'll tell you why you pulled the trigger ... why your partner was dying.

12:49.240 --> 12:50.040
Armin...

12:50.490 --> 12:55.830
Thanks to you, you've got his hands dirty, none of our team is dead.

12:56.920 --> 12:57.840
Thank you.

13:02.840 --> 13:05.360
Captain Levi, I ...

13:05.360 --> 13:08.220
I thought it was wrong to fight other humans ...

13:08.930 --> 13:11.510
And it was wrong to order us to do so.

13:12.520 --> 13:15.120
I was afraid of hurting other people.

13:15.890 --> 13:19.270
But ... I'm the one who did wrong.

13:19.270 --> 13:21.110
Next time I'll shoot.

13:21.110 --> 13:24.680
I did not say who is right or wrong.

13:25.570 --> 13:27.430
I do not know either.

13:28.160 --> 13:30.580
You really are the one in the wrong?

13:34.250 --> 13:35.350
Then...

13:36.500 --> 13:38.840
Now we hear what he has to say.

13:46.840 --> 13:50.890
Wait up! I'm just an old used to move the carts around al--

13:50.890 --> 13:52.490
I have already met this man.

13:55.730 --> 13:58.430
In the city, people called him Boss.

14:00.900 --> 14:03.770
Yes I know. Dimo Reeves, right?

14:04.190 --> 14:04.900
Tsk!

14:05.360 --> 14:10.910
We were just following orders of the Military Police. And we have failed to big ...

14:10.910 --> 14:13.910
For what it's worth, the plunder Reeves company.

14:14.370 --> 14:19.530
They will stop with me and my son. They will ensure that all employees die in "so-called" accidents.

14:20.880 --> 14:22.640
So you die without a fight?

14:23.960 --> 14:27.010
Trost was supposed to already be collapsed by now, but instead he persevered.

14:27.590 --> 14:31.070
This is because the company Reeves has brought people to work together.

14:31.680 --> 14:36.270
But if the company is gone forever, how many people will survive the winter?

14:37.480 --> 14:39.810
You're suggesting we work with you?

14:40.270 --> 14:43.340
We just need to know where Eren e Historia.

14:43.820 --> 14:47.280
If you are providing the military police, we may be able to figure it out.

14:47.490 --> 14:51.660
But you can stop the city and my employees from starving?

14:52.070 --> 14:53.830
I can not guarantee it.

14:53.830 --> 14:57.540
However, you can trust that we will move to that end.

15:06.130 --> 15:08.370
Finally, this hassle is over.

15:10.260 --> 15:13.510
Erwin, what a mess! The situation is getting worse!

15:13.510 --> 15:17.760
There are two things! First: Eren and Historia were kidnapped!

15:18.310 --> 15:20.600
even three crew members were killed.

15:20.600 --> 15:25.070
I plan to meet with Levi to see if we can find out their location.

15:25.070 --> 15:26.480
And the other thing?

15:26.650 --> 15:30.360
Eren was reminded of a conversation between Ymir and Bertholdt, but ...

15:30.570 --> 15:32.280
Shit, if it is true ...

15:33.030 --> 15:34.940
My head explodes!

15:34.930 --> 15:36.160
-You calm!

15:36.700 --> 15:37.790
What is the problem?

15:42.080 --> 15:45.090
If you do not recover quickly, Eren likely to be devoured!

15:50.800 --> 15:53.430
Hey! Levi and others are actually there?

15:54.010 --> 15:59.270
Yes. I promised him that I worked, so they let us go.

16:01.690 --> 16:02.790
We arrived?

16:11.030 --> 16:12.530
Reeves, damn ...

16:14.910 --> 16:17.350
Sorry, friends.

16:24.210 --> 16:28.340
And now? It means that we are really safe, Old?

16:28.340 --> 16:29.800
There are no guarantees.

16:29.800 --> 16:32.550
Are you kidding! Then why?!

16:32.550 --> 16:35.260
A trader must learn to follow your nose.

16:35.680 --> 16:41.060
Not only to smell easy money, but to sniff the profit that awaits him in the future.

16:41.060 --> 16:43.770
Once found, you have to bite it and not let it go longer.

16:44.350 --> 16:46.270
I got it? Remember that.

16:47.060 --> 16:49.650
Sorry I'm late! It is still in progress?

16:49.940 --> 16:52.530
Yes, I'm pretty new to do this.

16:52.780 --> 16:58.990
Sannes, should know that I too am a novice in the torture, so please forgive me!

16:58.990 --> 17:01.290
Wait! What do you want?!

17:01.290 --> 17:03.820
Who the hell torture without question before ?!

17:04.000 --> 17:07.960
Oh, right ... We have some questions for you.

17:07.960 --> 17:10.339
Where Eren e Historia?

17:10.339 --> 17:12.510
Why are you trying Historia?

17:12.510 --> 17:13.760
Who is the Reiss family?

17:13.920 --> 17:16.640
Too slow! Can not you see that we are in a hurry ?!

17:19.849 --> 17:21.230
It begins again...

17:21.680 --> 17:25.270
It seems to me that the screams are stronger than when it did the captain.

17:25.849 --> 17:30.150
Even though I know it to save those two, it makes me sick.

17:31.400 --> 17:34.110
Let's face it ... We are now criminals.

17:36.610 --> 17:38.890
The enemy we're fighting ...

17:38.890 --> 17:42.090
We are not killing them because they are trying to devour us.

17:42.580 --> 17:45.330
But because they have different opinions ...

17:45.330 --> 17:48.560
Indeed, because they belong to a group other than ours.

17:49.670 --> 17:51.500
And because of this, their lives ...

17:52.300 --> 17:53.080
Armin...

17:54.880 --> 17:57.970
All of us ... We're not good people.

17:59.970 --> 18:03.390
Sorry, I'm not good like you to tear nails.

18:03.770 --> 18:06.980
How many have you torn before becoming that good?

18:08.150 --> 18:09.890
Too many to count.

18:10.400 --> 18:15.770
Inside the walls so narrow, you know because it's never a war broke out?

18:16.610 --> 18:21.240
It is because the first team Interna has dirtied his hands to protect peace.

18:22.790 --> 18:25.250
A teacher too clever ...

18:25.250 --> 18:27.620
A couple of fools who tried to fly ...

18:27.960 --> 18:30.250
A bitch of a country ranch!

18:30.420 --> 18:34.000
Humanity has gone so far just because we intervened us!

18:34.420 --> 18:36.590
You should thank us!

18:36.590 --> 18:41.050
I've never seen anyone so happy in torturing as you do!

18:41.050 --> 18:42.320
You monster!

18:42.760 --> 18:45.350
But I'm not afraid.

18:45.350 --> 18:48.310
I ... I ...

18:48.770 --> 18:54.980
I'm the King ... I believe in the king and peace in the walls.

18:54.980 --> 18:58.320
All the things we did were justifiable ...

18:59.110 --> 19:00.320
Ma ...

19:01.240 --> 19:03.730
Thinking about it...

19:05.790 --> 19:08.170
Go right ahead and Torture me to death.

19:08.580 --> 19:12.840
Everything I've done in life is stained with blood.

19:14.960 --> 19:16.210
It 's time to take a break.

19:19.800 --> 19:23.490
It is worrying ... I'm beginning to feel sorry for him.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.910
Stop pushing. You hurt me...

19:32.020 --> 19:32.880
Ralph!

19:33.310 --> 19:37.570
You're pathetic. It took only a fingernail to make you talk.

19:39.030 --> 19:43.120
Sannes can not get more. Not at all like him.

19:43.120 --> 19:46.330
As if he cared! That was his decision.

19:46.330 --> 19:51.120
That guy never shuts his mouth with talk about peace and the king. The rest of us hate it.

19:51.290 --> 19:53.790
Do us a favor and kill him.

19:55.460 --> 19:58.920
It will not happen until you confirm your story.

19:59.300 --> 20:03.050
You've already got what you wanted from me. Give me peace!

20:03.510 --> 20:07.060
I will have a bed in my cell or what?

20:22.910 --> 20:25.530
Ready, Sannes? Let's try again.

20:25.530 --> 20:28.120
Even for me it's tough, but I'll do my best to ...

20:28.120 --> 20:30.380
Reiss is the real royal family.

20:40.130 --> 20:42.970
So much not to be noticed ...

20:43.130 --> 20:45.570
Flegel is taking a life, damn it.

20:57.270 --> 21:00.610
Merchants should not sell themselves when it comes to trust.

21:06.490 --> 21:09.200
It 'been wise not to ask him where is Levi?

21:09.830 --> 21:12.120
It will present even if we do nothing.

21:12.580 --> 21:13.660
How do you know it?

21:14.210 --> 21:16.500
Because I grew up myself.

21:16.500 --> 21:19.500
Levi Ackermann is that kind of person.

21:27.800 --> 21:30.350
The real pretender to the throne ...

21:30.810 --> 21:32.010
... it's Historia?

21:32.640 --> 21:38.150
In other words, it is that Eren Historia are probably wherever he is Rod Reiss.

21:44.320 --> 21:45.360
This is him.

21:50.660 --> 21:51.790
History...

21:55.620 --> 21:57.460
I apologize for everything ...

23:40.560 --> 23:41.880
The past of a girl ...

23:42.520 --> 23:46.040
It's a pretty big secret to change the kingdom ...

23:46.860 --> 23:51.510
Once this secret is known in Erwin, he will take him to remember his past life ...

23:52.140 --> 23:56.540
