00:34.372 --> 00:37.312
Initiating landing procedure.
Everyone on standby.

00:37.352 --> 00:39.512
Cabin crew, prepare for landing.

00:39.512 --> 00:44.052
Security checks commencing.
All personnel in position. Everyone
returned from the rest room? –Check.

00:44.092 --> 00:46.752
All little tables folded away?
ALL: Check.

00:46.792 --> 00:49.012
Seat belts on?
ALL: Check!

00:49.012 --> 00:52.832
–Winkers to shut down. Landing gear down.
–Requesting landing line.

00:52.872 --> 00:58.152
Suggest left-hand traffic pattern,
sir, towards that landing light
edifice at the end of the street.

00:58.192 --> 01:00.432
Applying brakes now.

01:00.432 --> 01:03.572
Velocity decreasing.
Revs 2,000 and dwindling.

01:03.572 --> 01:06.392
Pavement in sight.
Landing lights locked.

01:06.392 --> 01:09.992
Standby, we're attempting to stop.
Good luck, everybody.

01:10.032 --> 01:12.412
Handbrake engaging.

01:12.412 --> 01:14.672
Ignition off.

01:14.672 --> 01:16.972
Wow, we made a good landing!

01:16.972 --> 01:20.412
–Well done, everyone.
–OK, doors to manual.

01:20.412 --> 01:22.972
Disembark in your own time,
gentlemen.

01:30.132 --> 01:33.072
What sort of godforsaken place
is this?

01:33.072 --> 01:34.932
This is worse than Rimmer World.

01:34.972 --> 01:40.172
Get out of town, this is brilliant!
This is just like where I grew up,
except there's less burning cars.

01:40.212 --> 01:44.304
I'll find out where Mr Charles is
from that information droid.

01:45.632 --> 01:48.412
Salutations, fellow droid, sir.

01:48.412 --> 01:51.932
I'm looking for the actor
Craig Charles. Can you direct?

01:51.972 --> 01:54.632
Perhaps it's overheated.
Are you usually that red?

01:54.672 --> 01:57.152
I'm going to place this instrument

01:57.152 --> 02:00.312
into your voice unit
and I want you to say “aah”.

02:00.352 --> 02:05.572
–Hi, it's me. Where are you?
CRAIG CHARLES: <i>In the Rovers, kid. Why?</i>
–See you in a minute.

02:05.612 --> 02:08.592
Seems to be some sort
of malfunction, sirs.

02:15.952 --> 02:17.592
Good grief!

02:17.592 --> 02:23.152
Vandals have stolen the droid's
entire hard drive and stuffed
envelopes through its voice unit.

02:23.192 --> 02:24.932
What kind of place is this?

02:24.972 --> 02:28.512
–Let's ask in the shop.
–Let me do the talking, sir.

02:28.512 --> 02:30.832
I've been studying the dialect.

02:30.832 --> 02:33.752
I'll wait outside, guard Carbug.

02:37.212 --> 02:39.592
Earth, man.
INHALES DEEPLY

02:39.592 --> 02:41.692
Smell those chip butties.

02:47.952 --> 02:51.352
Hiya, chuck, pal, love, sir.
We're looking…

02:51.352 --> 02:56.752
I mean, lewk-ing
for granny-grabbing, philandering
taxi driver Lloyd Mullaney,

02:56.752 --> 02:58.772
as played by Craig Charles.

02:58.772 --> 03:02.832
Um… I think he's in the Rovers,
learning his lines.

03:02.832 --> 03:05.072
Is this some sort of joke?

03:05.072 --> 03:09.012
The Rovers?
Well, I'll stand at the bottom
of our stairs and eat a barn cake.

03:09.052 --> 03:11.172
We were just past that,
weren't we, lads?

03:11.212 --> 03:15.332
MANCUNIAN ACCENT: Aye, we were,
weren't we?
–What a load of numpties.

03:15.372 --> 03:19.632
–Get your keks on, lads,
we're sorted. –Quality. –Mint.

03:19.632 --> 03:21.872
Ta very much, chuck, pal, love, sir.

03:21.912 --> 03:23.852
–See ya.
–Ta-ra, pet.

03:23.852 --> 03:27.832
Good job, chaps. We were
so authentic it was frightening.

03:34.212 --> 03:37.892
Oi! You'll never guess who I've just
seen. All your mates from Red Dwarf.

03:37.932 --> 03:40.312
They're outside.
–Serious?

03:40.312 --> 03:43.952
Yeah. They've just landed
in a little spaceship.

03:43.952 --> 03:47.072
It was green. Um…
What's it called?

03:47.072 --> 03:52.372
Listen, mate, don't mess about. I've
got loads of lines to learn. I've got
a massive scene this afternoon.

03:52.412 --> 03:54.532
But I'm serious. I know what I saw.

03:54.572 --> 03:57.132
Even you were there.
–I was there?

03:57.132 --> 03:59.352
How many have you had?

03:59.352 --> 04:02.272
Well, I've had a couple,
but listen, I've just seen you.

04:02.312 --> 04:05.172
So high, ugly…
It was definitely you.

04:09.212 --> 04:13.132
–Hi, guys. What are you doing here?
–Ah, Mr Charles, sir.

04:13.132 --> 04:14.732
My name is Kryten.

04:14.732 --> 04:19.712
I am a fictitious character from
the television series Red Dwarf
and we really need your help.

04:19.752 --> 04:21.392
Told you.

04:27.292 --> 04:30.064
You're the only one
that can help us, man.

04:30.652 --> 04:32.792
I've heard about these.

04:32.792 --> 04:35.312
They're called flashbacks.
Flashbacks…

04:35.312 --> 04:38.272
I know you don't exist.
–OK, no need to rub it in!

04:38.312 --> 04:42.952
Just give us the address of whoever
created us and we'll jump into
Starbug and be out of here.

04:42.992 --> 04:44.712
Starbug⁈

04:44.712 --> 04:47.192
I just told you.
They landed outside the Kabin.

04:47.232 --> 04:49.892
That is OK? We're not going to get
a ticket, are we?

04:49.932 --> 04:52.832
You're not all here.
I know you're not all here.

04:52.872 --> 04:56.192
–Er, he's not all here,
but the rest of us are. –Yeah.

04:56.232 --> 04:58.812
You see, sir,
we're from an alternate dimension

04:58.852 --> 05:01.892
and we need answers, like,
“How many episodes do we have left?”

05:01.932 --> 05:05.592
Um, I know how many episodes
you've got left.

05:05.592 --> 05:08.952
–How many?
–Er, one.

05:08.952 --> 05:12.652
It's called Back To Earth—
Part Three.

05:12.652 --> 05:16.492
Script due in a couple of days.
RUSTLING

05:16.492 --> 05:18.532
All we need from you
is an address, bud.

05:18.572 --> 05:22.152
We've got to speak to our creator.

05:22.152 --> 05:25.092
And I've got to get
back to the Priory.

05:26.232 --> 05:30.992
I am so glad I'm not him.
The guy's a wreck. He pretends
to be somebody else all day.

05:31.032 --> 05:33.738
That's no way to make a living.
Smeghead.

06:58.996 --> 07:00.636
Visitors, sir.

07:07.416 --> 07:10.256
I'm surprised
you didn't find me sooner.

07:10.256 --> 07:13.676
It's not an easy thing
to find your creator.

07:13.676 --> 07:16.316
And how can he assist you?

07:16.316 --> 07:18.156
We want more life…

07:18.156 --> 07:19.856
smegger!

07:19.856 --> 07:24.836
A series cancellation sequence can't
be revised once it's established.

07:24.836 --> 07:26.436
What about all the loose ends?

07:26.476 --> 07:29.996
Me and Kochanski?
Getting back home?

07:31.356 --> 07:33.076
I grew weary of you.

07:34.816 --> 07:38.176
Does this mean
this is our last episode, sir?

07:38.176 --> 07:42.376
The light that burns twice as bright
burns half as long.

07:42.376 --> 07:46.016
Yeah, but the light that burns half
as bright burns four times as long.

07:46.056 --> 07:48.676
But the light that burns
three-quarters as bright

07:48.716 --> 07:53.576
burns five-eighths as long
as the light that burns a quarter as
bright as the light that's gone out.

07:53.616 --> 07:55.816
(I'd have needed
a calculator for that. )

07:55.856 --> 08:00.516
The point is, gentlemen, you have
all burned so very, very brightly

08:00.516 --> 08:02.916
and for so very, very long.

08:02.916 --> 08:05.796
Just like the red dwarf star itself,

08:05.796 --> 08:08.356
nothing lasts forever.

08:08.356 --> 08:11.116
Not even…

08:11.116 --> 08:12.736
banks.

08:14.536 --> 08:18.876
–What about a Kryten spin-off series?
I could be his sidekick. –Or a sitcom!

08:18.916 --> 08:23.436
I'd even do a sitcom. Anything…
Anything to stay alive.
–What about a show about cats?

08:23.476 --> 08:29.716
That would never work. Look, what you
need is me and Kryten thrown back in
time, like a new kind of Robin Hood.

08:29.756 --> 08:34.116
Each week, he gets captured
and is about to be burnt
at the stake for witchcraft

08:34.155 --> 08:37.576
or just having a stupid head,
and each week I—
in a different new,

08:37.616 --> 08:40.076
brave new way—
rescue him… bravely.

08:41.416 --> 08:44.736
All right, it sucks. Fair enough.

08:46.476 --> 08:49.796
Your deaths will be magnificent.

08:49.796 --> 08:53.476
Sad and beautiful.

08:53.476 --> 08:56.356
The shooting script.

08:56.356 --> 08:58.256
Let me describe it for you.

08:58.256 --> 09:01.456
You try to escape your destiny
and run.

09:02.916 --> 09:04.456
I give chase.

09:20.556 --> 09:22.736
Move out of my way!

09:25.516 --> 09:27.376
Move!

09:30.556 --> 09:33.456
Move! Move! Out of my way!

10:25.836 --> 10:28.816
Sad and beautiful.

10:30.996 --> 10:36.736
Blade Runner is the film
which inspired both your creation
and your death. Gentlemen…

10:36.736 --> 10:40.656
time to die.

10:49.836 --> 10:52.176
Come here! You'd kill me⁈

10:52.176 --> 10:55.536
You're damn right we would. You know
how much you've made me suffer?

10:55.576 --> 10:58.296
The life you created for me,
all those cheap laughs.

10:58.336 --> 11:00.876
All that stuff about
Rachel the inflatable doll.

11:00.916 --> 11:04.636
All the jokes about my puncture repair kit.
–Actually, that bit was funny.

11:04.676 --> 11:07.096
Sorry, carry on.

11:07.096 --> 11:09.536
Did you ever think how I felt?
Start writing.

11:09.576 --> 11:13.636
I save the day. I get a girlfriend
who's gorgeous and crazy about me.

11:13.676 --> 11:17.656
And before you even think of it,
after we've bonked
each other senseless,

11:17.696 --> 11:21.856
she doesn't turn out
to be my long-lost sister. –Damn.

11:21.856 --> 11:23.956
How did you know
I was thinking that?

11:23.996 --> 11:25.576
Because I know how you think.

11:25.616 --> 11:29.180
Now write me a happy ending
or we'll take you with us.

11:42.636 --> 11:45.236
You can never win.

11:45.236 --> 11:47.976
Accept it and die well.

11:56.736 --> 12:00.056
If you kill me, you moron,
you'll cease to exist.

12:00.056 --> 12:04.236
Haven't you been following
any of this? Aargh!

12:04.236 --> 12:06.296
I've been dead for ages, man—

12:06.296 --> 12:09.456
just sitting around,
getting old and fat.

12:09.456 --> 12:12.236
I never thought I had
responsibility to anyone.

12:12.276 --> 12:17.316
I never thought there was anyone
out there who was on my side,
who wanted things to work out.

12:17.356 --> 12:20.056
We've got a fan club.

12:20.056 --> 12:22.416
They've even named
a TV station after me.

12:22.456 --> 12:25.276
I was never alone,
I just didn't realise it.

12:25.316 --> 12:28.156
Now I want more life, smegger!

12:32.176 --> 12:33.876
I've killed him.

12:33.876 --> 12:36.676
Well, we shouldn't exist.

12:36.676 --> 12:38.756
All I wanted was a sitcom.

12:38.756 --> 12:40.176
THUD!

12:40.176 --> 12:43.296
A sitcom in a biscuit factory—
is that really too much to ask?

12:43.336 --> 12:47.336
I killed him. How can I kill him?
That's not me. I don't kill people.

12:47.376 --> 12:49.856
You killed him
because he made you kill him, sir.

12:49.896 --> 12:54.016
Kryten, Page 19. “You killed him,
sir, because he made you kill him.”

12:54.056 --> 12:57.696
It's all in here. He lied to us
about our deaths on the street.

12:57.736 --> 13:02.376
That was just to throw us off. He
killed us by getting us to kill him,

13:02.376 --> 13:06.416
and now we're gonna die too because
there's no-one to keep us alive.

13:06.456 --> 13:10.796
He's right. In fact,
I don't think I feel too well.

13:10.796 --> 13:12.736
Me either. I think I'm gonna…

13:12.736 --> 13:15.640
–Check the end, see what happens!
–Oh, yeah.

13:31.156 --> 13:33.256
We can write our own end!

13:34.476 --> 13:37.236
Of course! What's written happens.

13:37.236 --> 13:40.056
We're free now.

13:52.656 --> 13:55.436
Hey, man, I feel like a God!

13:55.436 --> 14:00.976
I feel like I've got liquid gold
coursing through every vein in my
body. Hey, we can get out of this.

14:01.016 --> 14:03.556
As long as we've got this,
we control the world.

14:03.596 --> 14:05.496
We can do whatever we want.

14:05.496 --> 14:09.324
–I could command my own ship.
–I could get Kochanski back.

14:11.096 --> 14:13.656
–I could get some new sponges.
–How come I didn't get a line?

14:13.696 --> 14:16.956
I just gave you one there.
I knew you'd be smegged off.

14:16.996 --> 14:19.216
I control everything.

14:19.216 --> 14:22.076
So the rest of our loaves can be one
giant hedonistic wash filfulment.

14:22.116 --> 14:24.636
Typos, sorry, guys.

14:24.636 --> 14:30.736
–You really think you can write your
wee out of this? –Hey, witch me, baby
just witch me. –He controls the world.

14:30.776 --> 14:34.956
He can do anything he wants.
–I could, if I wanted to, do this.

14:38.516 --> 14:40.976
Lister, stop! That's an order!

14:44.356 --> 14:46.596
Aargh! This is brilliant!

14:46.596 --> 14:48.736
What's he doing?

14:48.736 --> 14:52.300
You've git to hop me stoop him, sir.
Hop me stoop him.

15:08.876 --> 15:10.916
Ow!

15:13.416 --> 15:17.336
This is absolutely awesome.
All right, next step.

15:17.336 --> 15:20.816
Happy ending. –Back off, sir.
There's no way we can get to him.

15:20.856 --> 15:23.536
Whoa, whoa! I didn't type that.
Or that.

15:23.536 --> 15:26.076
Hey, I'm not typing this, guys.
What's happened?

15:26.116 --> 15:30.476
Maybe it's not the typewriter
that's controlling our world.
Maybe it's something else.

15:30.516 --> 15:33.436
What is it with these damn things?

15:33.436 --> 15:36.636
Why do I keep making them?
–Useless.

15:36.636 --> 15:38.616
What actually is it, sir?

15:38.616 --> 15:41.816
There's something inside. Blow.

15:49.756 --> 15:51.496
It looks like a squid.

15:53.076 --> 15:54.996
Why would I be making squids?

15:54.996 --> 16:00.056
That something else that
controls the world, how about
it's our combined subconscious?

16:00.096 --> 16:03.476
Like the time we were ambushed
by the Despair Squid?

16:03.516 --> 16:05.736
On that ocean planet.

16:05.736 --> 16:07.876
That thing that attacked us
years ago.

16:07.916 --> 16:10.016
Whoa, whoa! Hang on a minute.

16:10.016 --> 16:14.376
Are you saying the creature in the
water tank, the one that inked us,
was another Despair Squid?

16:14.416 --> 16:19.776
Cos I don't feel despair.
I feel… elation, joy.

16:19.776 --> 16:23.156
I've felt great since I got here.
In here, I'm somebody.

16:23.196 --> 16:24.876
It's made me want to live again.

16:24.916 --> 16:27.656
Ssh, footsteps! Do you hear them?

16:27.656 --> 16:30.676
Kochanski!

16:30.676 --> 16:34.196
I can smell her perfume!

16:35.636 --> 16:37.596
I can get her back again—

16:37.596 --> 16:40.136
kids, everything I've ever wanted.

16:40.136 --> 16:42.356
But in the real world, sir,
you'll be dying.

16:42.396 --> 16:44.196
This isn't real.
–It'll feel real.

16:44.236 --> 16:46.636
Not in your heart.

16:46.636 --> 16:49.176
I've got no option, Krytie.

16:49.176 --> 16:53.070
This is the only chance I've got
of getting her back again.

16:59.036 --> 17:02.396
Miss Kochanski's not dead, sir.

17:06.236 --> 17:07.976
Those kids were right⁈

17:07.976 --> 17:11.636
I-I-I lied to you, sir.
She dumped you.

17:11.636 --> 17:13.195
I was trying to protect you.

17:13.236 --> 17:15.356
She's out there somewhere.

17:15.356 --> 17:20.336
She's in here somewhere as well.
In fact she's right behind that door.
In this world, she loves me.

17:20.376 --> 17:24.156
In fact, in this world, she's gonna
love me until the moment I die.

17:24.195 --> 17:27.195
–She's not real.
–Nobody's perfect.

17:28.316 --> 17:31.156
Look, I'm becoming transparent.

17:31.156 --> 17:33.236
I'm returning to reality.

17:33.236 --> 17:36.236
Me too. Sir!

17:36.236 --> 17:37.896
I've got to stay.

17:56.396 --> 17:58.956
What the hell happened there?

17:58.956 --> 18:01.496
I need diagrams and pointy arrows.

18:01.496 --> 18:04.716
Best guess,
our natural defences fought back.

18:04.716 --> 18:09.376
Our previous encounter
with the creature must have
strengthened our antibodies.

18:09.416 --> 18:12.256
Which gave us the option
to choose between realities.

18:12.296 --> 18:16.322
This one or the one that started
when Kremlin Kate showed up.

18:18.776 --> 18:22.676
What if monkey boy
chooses not to fight this?

18:22.676 --> 18:24.716
Then he won't be coming out.

18:24.716 --> 18:27.296
<i>I've gotta stay.</i>

18:42.016 --> 18:45.456
It seems you're undecided about
which reality you wish to live in.

18:45.496 --> 18:48.116
I'm mulling it over.

18:49.736 --> 18:52.442
Would you mind if
I asked you a question?

18:53.196 --> 18:54.916
Shoot.

18:54.916 --> 18:59.196
In your dreams, did you kiss me?

19:04.956 --> 19:06.616
Was it good?

19:08.196 --> 19:09.912
I never wanted to wake up.

19:13.276 --> 19:15.216
Then don't.

19:57.956 --> 20:00.716
Where are you going?

20:00.716 --> 20:03.476
I have to leave and get you back.

20:03.476 --> 20:06.516
The real me?

20:06.516 --> 20:10.036
You'll never get me.
I'm way out of your league!

20:10.036 --> 20:13.356
I thought that, too, but I was wrong.

20:13.356 --> 20:15.996
You were right.

20:15.996 --> 20:18.756
Nah, I'm pretty cool.

20:18.756 --> 20:20.816
I don't take any smeg.

20:20.816 --> 20:25.096
And even though I'm disgusting,
sometimes I can be quite brave.

20:26.676 --> 20:29.796
–You'll never get me.
–Yeah…

20:29.796 --> 20:32.296
I will.

20:59.756 --> 21:05.776
I mean, explain this—
how can me getting everything I've
ever wanted be caused by despair ink?

21:05.816 --> 21:08.776
Analysis of the creature, sir,
suggests it's a female.

21:08.816 --> 21:11.616
Male squid, female squid—
what's the difference?

21:11.656 --> 21:15.876
Females can do ten squidy things
at once, but not so good
at reversing round rocks?

21:15.916 --> 21:19.236
The male defence system
is an ink that produces despair.

21:19.276 --> 21:22.156
It seems that the female ink
causes the opposite.

21:22.196 --> 21:26.656
What? It gives you joy?
That's like attacking something
that retaliates by giving you

21:26.696 --> 21:30.456
an Indian head massage or an
aromatherapy luxury nail treatment.

21:30.496 --> 21:32.916
What kind of crazy
defence mechanism is that?

21:32.956 --> 21:37.136
–It's an ingenious one, sir,
because it means
you stop attacking it. –Yeah.

21:37.176 --> 21:40.316
And while you're all happy-clappy,
she scarpers, right?

21:40.356 --> 21:41.816
Precisely, sir.

21:44.156 --> 21:46.356
How did she get on board?

21:49.436 --> 21:51.176
I kinda brought her.

21:53.196 --> 21:56.116
Years ago, from that ocean planet.

21:56.116 --> 21:58.516
♫ I'm gonna eat you, little fishy

21:58.516 --> 22:00.636
♫ Cos I like little fish. ♫

22:02.716 --> 22:04.536
Then she escaped.

22:04.536 --> 22:08.100
I knew you guys would get mad
so I didn't say nothing.

22:09.476 --> 22:12.116
Boy, has she grown.

22:12.116 --> 22:14.756
So what's gonna happen to her?

22:14.756 --> 22:16.916
I'm thinking sushi-time.

22:16.916 --> 22:22.262
I'm thinking we drop her off
at the nearest ocean moon—
make some happy sea life.

22:24.056 --> 22:27.256
What's gonna happen to
everybody in the reality we left—

22:27.296 --> 22:29.756
the guys all watching us on TV?
–They'll continue

22:29.796 --> 22:33.836
to exist as a consequence
of us creating them
in our hallucination, sir.

22:33.876 --> 22:37.996
It's quantum mechanics.
Every decision that's made
creates a new universe,

22:38.036 --> 22:40.276
as do all dreams
and hallucinations.

22:40.316 --> 22:44.856
It's multiverse 101.
–But those sad suckers will
live out the rest of their lives

22:44.896 --> 22:48.416
convinced they're the real ones
and we're characters from a TV show.

22:48.456 --> 22:51.916
And if you told them the truth,
you know what they'd probably do?

22:51.956 --> 22:54.716
–Laugh.
–Yeah.

22:56.876 --> 22:59.156
They probably would.

23:06.596 --> 23:08.196
♫ It's cold outside

23:08.196 --> 23:10.296
♫ There's no kind of atmosphere

23:10.296 --> 23:13.516
♫ I'm all alone, more or less

23:13.516 --> 23:16.516
♫ Let me fly far away from here

23:16.516 --> 23:19.916
♫ Fun, fun, fun

23:19.916 --> 23:23.016
♫ In the sun, sun, sun

23:23.016 --> 23:24.956
♫ I want to lie

23:24.956 --> 23:27.156
♫ Shipwrecked and comatose

23:27.156 --> 23:30.236
♫ Drinking fresh mango juice

23:30.236 --> 23:33.636
♫ Goldfish shoals nibbling at my toes

23:33.636 --> 23:36.476
♫ Fun, fun, fun

23:36.476 --> 23:40.876
♫ In the sun, sun, sun

23:40.876 --> 23:43.796
♫ Fun, fun, fun

23:43.796 --> 23:46.316
♫ In the sun, sun, sun. ♫
