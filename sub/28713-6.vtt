<i>Hey, pass the shovel over here.
We gotta tie him up!</i>

00:27.444 --> 00:29.436
<i>Yeah! All aboard! All aboard!</i>

00:33.033 --> 00:36.276
<i>Help me! Help me! He's killing me!
I don't want to die! I don't want to die!</i>

00:36.370 --> 00:37.986
<i>Help me! He's crushing me!</i>

00:51.510 --> 00:52.510
Toss me one?

00:55.097 --> 00:56.097
Whoa.

00:56.848 --> 00:58.134
What'd you do with my sister?

01:01.603 --> 01:04.687
There's hot water in the bathroom.
Might as well use it.

01:05.649 --> 01:06.649
Try the vanilla.

01:09.820 --> 01:11.652
<i>This is Morgan. Anybody copy?</i>

01:14.491 --> 01:15.491
Go for Annie.

01:16.868 --> 01:18.154
Everything okay there?

01:18.245 --> 01:22.785
Yeah. Everyone's in the back.
Watching a movie.

01:26.044 --> 01:29.879
Listen, thanks for holding down the fort.
But don't get too comfortable.

01:30.799 --> 01:32.791
We don't plan on staying there
much longer.

01:33.510 --> 01:35.001
You know the roads are out, right?

01:35.721 --> 01:36.757
<i>We do.</i>

01:37.180 --> 01:39.100
You can't go anywhere near
those radiation signs.

01:39.891 --> 01:40.891
<i>We know.</i>

01:43.186 --> 01:44.927
Then how do you plan
on getting out of here?

01:45.772 --> 01:48.264
<i>We'll show you. You mind opening the gate?</i>

02:11.256 --> 02:13.543
We were telling you the truth
when we first met you.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.130
We just didn't tell you everything.

02:23.435 --> 02:27.395
I guess you could say we were broken
by the bad things we done...

02:28.774 --> 02:32.563
all the things that we'd regretted,
and having to live with them

02:33.278 --> 02:35.440
and not being able to run away from them.

02:43.580 --> 02:44.912
Wasn't easy getting here.

02:46.041 --> 02:48.909
Roads were blocked,
bridges were washed out,

02:49.002 --> 02:51.540
and there was an actual mountain
between us

02:51.630 --> 02:55.670
and the only other living person
we have spoken to in a really long time.

02:56.343 --> 02:59.381
But we didn't give up. We found a way.

03:00.806 --> 03:05.301
We found a way all the way over here
because we had something to fight for.

03:06.269 --> 03:08.261
Even if it wasn't what we thought it was.

03:09.272 --> 03:12.185
We don't have someone
on the other end of the radio now.

03:12.693 --> 03:15.060
But we do still have
something to fight for.

03:16.738 --> 03:17.774
We got each other.

03:20.575 --> 03:21.575
And we got you.

03:23.161 --> 03:26.745
So I'm telling you,
as impossible as all this seems...

03:29.084 --> 03:30.200
we can do this.

03:33.422 --> 03:36.460
We can,
'cause we done the impossible before.

03:39.136 --> 03:40.627
But we're gonna need some help.

03:47.769 --> 03:48.850
What do we do now?

03:49.271 --> 03:50.271
Now...

03:51.565 --> 03:52.772
we fix the plane.

03:56.278 --> 03:58.235
And we fly back across the mountains...

04:00.240 --> 04:01.240
together.

05:03.595 --> 05:05.757
Hey, Grace, this is Morgan. Do you copy?

05:10.977 --> 05:12.184
If you're listening...

05:13.730 --> 05:15.562
we're working on a way to get home.

05:16.650 --> 05:17.731
And, uh...

05:18.819 --> 05:21.186
we found some people
I think you're gonna want to meet.

05:22.823 --> 05:23.823
Do you copy?

05:23.907 --> 05:26.320
<i>I repeat. Do you copy?</i>

05:46.429 --> 05:48.466
Okay, we're gonna leave this channel open.

05:48.557 --> 05:50.765
If you hear this, please let us know.

07:14.768 --> 07:15.768
You okay?

07:18.521 --> 07:20.183
Yeah. Yeah. I'm good.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.536
Can you give me a hand
with the landing gear?

07:24.778 --> 07:25.778
Sure.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.251
Do you think it's going to work?

07:52.764 --> 07:53.845
It was your idea.

07:55.016 --> 07:56.016
What do you think?

08:02.816 --> 08:03.816
It's going to work.

08:05.485 --> 08:08.728
The book says you can only see
with your heart, not your eyes.

08:09.114 --> 08:10.901
So I got rid of my eyes.

08:12.659 --> 08:14.019
And your heart told you the truth?

08:15.161 --> 08:16.161
Yeah.

08:16.621 --> 08:18.658
Does your heart know
how to fix the reduction gear

08:18.748 --> 08:21.206
on a 575-horsepower turboprop?

08:22.419 --> 08:23.500
It doesn't need to.

08:24.546 --> 08:25.546
Copy that.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.841
The reduction gearbox?

08:31.636 --> 08:33.798
She needs to know
how to align the planetary gears.

08:34.179 --> 08:38.515
All right. Stand by. I got to
clear some of this jerky-man jerky.

08:43.815 --> 08:44.815
That's oil.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.067
I hope.

08:47.444 --> 08:50.733
I'll find a rag while you determine
the source of that unfortunate spill.

08:50.822 --> 08:56.659
Yeah. Uh, and a brewski.
I work better with a five-outta-ten buzz.

08:56.745 --> 09:01.206
Don't we all? Charlie,
tell them this might take a minute.

09:05.462 --> 09:06.703
<i>It might take a minute.</i>

09:07.797 --> 09:08.797
Copy that.

09:08.882 --> 09:11.625
Dylan, who are you talking to?

09:12.343 --> 09:14.005
It's okay. They're far away.

09:14.637 --> 09:16.877
They're gonna help us make the plane
from where they are.

09:17.891 --> 09:20.725
There's Charlie and...
What's the other's name?

09:20.810 --> 09:22.301
It doesn't matter, Dylan.

09:23.646 --> 09:26.434
We're here to help them leave
so we can go back to how things were.

09:31.988 --> 09:32.988
How's the ankle?

09:34.657 --> 09:35.773
It's fine.

09:36.159 --> 09:38.651
Yeah? Let me take a look at it.

09:40.497 --> 09:41.533
Let's go.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.250
All right.

09:47.045 --> 09:48.581
Come on. Let's get back to the plane.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.147
You want to run, don't you?

10:12.612 --> 10:13.944
I used to run too.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.703
But I never tried to do it
with a sprained ankle.

10:26.334 --> 10:30.374
If I were you,
I'd wait a week before you take off. Shh.

10:32.173 --> 10:33.914
Maybe get a new pair of shoes.

10:35.468 --> 10:36.584
And socks.

10:37.887 --> 10:40.755
My boyfriend says
survival starts with socks.

10:40.849 --> 10:42.056
Well, that's a fact.

10:42.600 --> 10:43.600
How's the patient?

10:43.685 --> 10:47.929
You know, I was telling her she should,
uh, stay off her feet for a while.

10:48.022 --> 10:49.934
Well, one of 'em, anyway.

10:52.569 --> 10:55.186
Hey, we're thinking of heading back out
and keep up the search,

10:55.989 --> 10:58.447
make sure Sherry's on that plane
with us when we take off.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.494
Okay. Good luck.

11:09.460 --> 11:10.580
And keep him out of trouble.

11:11.254 --> 11:12.290
I'll try.

11:16.301 --> 11:17.301
Bye.

11:22.974 --> 11:24.181
All right, you ready?

11:24.559 --> 11:25.559
Ready!

12:05.141 --> 12:06.177
Get down!

12:12.232 --> 12:13.814
Is everybody okay?

12:13.900 --> 12:15.020
Was that the reduction gear?

12:24.202 --> 12:25.784
Where are we gonna get a new propeller?

12:46.099 --> 12:47.215
Oh, you fixed the mop.

12:48.935 --> 12:49.935
What happened?

12:50.728 --> 12:52.640
The engines worked,
but the propeller didn't.

12:55.233 --> 12:56.269
We'll be okay.

12:57.318 --> 12:58.878
We'll start searching for replacements.

12:59.696 --> 13:01.403
<i>Morgan? Alicia? Do you copy?</i>

13:03.032 --> 13:04.032
Grace?

13:05.118 --> 13:06.118
Are you okay?

13:06.828 --> 13:08.160
<i>Do you have a generator there?</i>

13:09.372 --> 13:10.954
We do. Why?

13:11.666 --> 13:12.827
I need you to unhook it.

13:13.209 --> 13:15.609
Gas it up, and then I need you
to get it ready for transport.

13:17.630 --> 13:18.630
What's going on, Grace?

13:19.299 --> 13:21.541
It's the plant.
If you don't do as I say...

13:24.053 --> 13:25.413
there's gonna be another meltdown.

13:34.480 --> 13:35.766
We're wasting time out here.

13:35.857 --> 13:38.645
Note on the registration said
she went west on 30.

13:38.735 --> 13:40.192
I've already been down this way.

13:41.487 --> 13:44.195
When I was looking for June,
nothing but dead ends.

13:45.033 --> 13:47.525
Wasn't till I linked up
with the people working on that plane,

13:47.869 --> 13:49.110
things really started clicking.

13:49.787 --> 13:52.074
Extra set of eyes help you see better.

13:59.797 --> 14:01.333
How did you get split up, anyway?

14:04.677 --> 14:05.713
Don't mean to pry.

14:13.478 --> 14:16.971
Me and Sherry, we, uh,
we got split up before...

14:17.065 --> 14:18.272
you know, we got split up.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.103
How'd you wind up with her rings?

14:23.696 --> 14:24.732
It's complicated.

14:25.323 --> 14:26.323
Oh, yeah.

14:30.661 --> 14:34.405
First time June told me she loved me,
she didn't actually tell me.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.207
She spelled it out with these.

14:40.755 --> 14:43.168
Never left my pocket
whole time I was lookin' for her.

14:45.385 --> 14:46.967
These things are always complicated.

14:49.180 --> 14:51.263
You're... you're lucky.
It worked out for you, John.

14:52.392 --> 14:55.601
You know... we're gonna find Sherry.

14:56.270 --> 14:57.831
She's gonna be on that plane
with everybody.

14:57.855 --> 15:01.098
No, I'm not talking about that.
I'm talking about how you are,

15:01.192 --> 15:02.524
you know, the way you see things.

15:04.195 --> 15:07.188
That had to have been
how you were before, right?

15:07.698 --> 15:10.315
How it is now,
and it hasn't burned you or...

15:11.077 --> 15:12.659
broken you, twisted you.

15:14.497 --> 15:15.863
I hope it never does.

15:16.833 --> 15:18.620
I'm even luckier than you think.

15:23.256 --> 15:28.172
World did a number on me before all this.
But all this gave me more than I ever had.

15:29.095 --> 15:32.463
That's been hard to deal with.
But I found a way.

15:35.351 --> 15:36.683
So maybe we should get goin'.

15:41.983 --> 15:44.441
What do you mean?
The second reactor's still running.

15:44.819 --> 15:47.277
I took it offline,
but the fuel still generates heat.

15:47.363 --> 15:48.570
It needs to be cooled.

15:48.656 --> 15:52.275
The generator operating the cooling system
just failed, which is why I need yours.

15:53.035 --> 15:55.275
Or else we'll all end up like the dead
I've been chasing.

15:59.500 --> 16:00.991
And this will fix everything?

16:02.587 --> 16:04.044
<i>This is only gonna buy us time.</i>

16:05.298 --> 16:08.006
You need to finish that plane... fast.

16:11.345 --> 16:12.345
We're good.

16:13.014 --> 16:14.676
Okay, Luci, we're gonna pull the plug.

16:17.727 --> 16:21.016
We're going dark, Strand.
We have to give up the genee.

16:21.564 --> 16:24.352
Luciana, listen.
We're gonna find a way to get you back.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.105
I don't know how, but we will.

16:30.406 --> 16:31.567
Hey, Luciana?

16:33.117 --> 16:34.198
Luciana?

16:38.164 --> 16:40.644
- What about this airstrip to the north?
- We checked that one.

16:40.708 --> 16:42.908
It's a haul and a half to get there.
It'd take too long.

16:44.170 --> 16:45.770
And what about this airport to the east?

16:48.382 --> 16:51.875
Wendell, remember that airport
you jacked those peanuts from?

16:51.969 --> 16:54.632
<i>Place was flooded.
Planes was all junked up.</i>

16:56.432 --> 16:57.432
Thought so.

16:58.142 --> 16:59.862
How the hell
are we supposed to get to them?

17:00.811 --> 17:02.171
You told them we would find a way.

17:02.563 --> 17:03.679
To keep their spirits up.

17:04.648 --> 17:06.310
To keep their spirits up?

17:07.401 --> 17:09.438
- Okay, guys, we'll figure it out.
- How, Charlie?

17:09.529 --> 17:11.839
The rubber has met the road,
and I haven't the faintest clue

17:11.864 --> 17:13.400
on how to deliver on my own platitude.

17:14.242 --> 17:15.653
So which one is it, Vic?

17:15.742 --> 17:19.327
You just dicking about the daisies,
or you planning on closing this deal?

17:19.413 --> 17:21.244
- I wanted to help them.
- So did I.

17:21.582 --> 17:23.502
You're not the only one
who wasn't on that plane.

17:28.089 --> 17:31.127
They got engines without props.
We got props without engines.

17:31.217 --> 17:34.631
We got all the pieces. We just need to
put them together somehow.

17:36.430 --> 17:37.430
Hopeless.

17:37.974 --> 17:42.093
At least our dearly departed brewer
had the advantage of self-sacrifice.

17:44.689 --> 17:46.021
Yeah. He's dead, Victor.

17:47.567 --> 17:50.401
And he took one for the team... real hard.

17:51.946 --> 17:55.155
He wanted to give up,
but he didn't in the end.

17:55.533 --> 17:59.823
So don't throw that "hopeless" horseshit
up in the air to land on us.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.245
There's got to be a way.

18:08.087 --> 18:11.080
Sarah, did you say you and Wendell
got everything from Jim's brewery?

18:11.173 --> 18:12.755
Yep. Every last bottle cap.

18:17.054 --> 18:18.054
Everything?

18:22.977 --> 18:24.388
Son of a bitch.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.473
We're gonna get 'em back.

18:53.090 --> 18:54.422
Will you help me move the cars?

18:54.967 --> 18:56.003
Yeah.

18:56.594 --> 18:57.714
We're gonna have to suit up.

18:58.888 --> 19:00.004
We're gonna have to go in.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.568
- Anything from John?
- No.

19:15.946 --> 19:19.405
They're still out of range.
How's it going in here?

19:19.742 --> 19:20.903
I don't know.

19:24.622 --> 19:26.830
I just hope the circuits aren't all fried.

19:28.959 --> 19:30.040
You okay?

19:34.340 --> 19:37.128
Just... the helicopter.

19:37.802 --> 19:39.213
If I'd kept it from...

19:40.513 --> 19:42.630
taking off, then we'd be home by now.

19:42.723 --> 19:46.387
Yeah. But there's no way
you could've done that, Al.

19:54.694 --> 19:55.775
Did something happen?

19:57.571 --> 19:58.687
When you were missing?

20:13.003 --> 20:17.088
You know, I asked to talk to you once...
off the record.

20:19.343 --> 20:20.675
And you let me talk.

20:24.432 --> 20:26.469
And that helped me more than you know.

20:28.728 --> 20:29.764
So...

20:30.980 --> 20:32.972
if you ever need to do the same, you can.

20:35.818 --> 20:36.899
Okay?

20:37.403 --> 20:38.735
It's the least I could do.

20:46.495 --> 20:47.736
Let's check the battery.

20:56.756 --> 21:00.716
That woman Morgan left with...
she's from the power plant, isn't she?

21:08.350 --> 21:09.386
Yeah.

21:10.603 --> 21:13.016
Dylan, Max, this isn't gonna work.

21:14.607 --> 21:15.643
We can't stay here.

21:15.733 --> 21:17.099
Whoa. Hey. Hey.

21:19.487 --> 21:21.570
You can't go back
to hiding behind the dead.

21:22.740 --> 21:25.135
We were safe there the last time
something like this happened.

21:25.159 --> 21:26.159
We'll be safe this time.

21:26.243 --> 21:27.359
You don't know that.

21:27.453 --> 21:30.070
You don't even know
if you'll be able to finish this plane.

21:30.164 --> 21:31.371
We will.

21:32.750 --> 21:34.550
We're just gonna need
all the help we can get.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.076
Annie,

21:36.670 --> 21:38.787
- it can work.
- He's right. If we just...

21:38.881 --> 21:41.464
Max. You're not the one who has to decide.

21:43.385 --> 21:46.674
Annie, neither are you.
Look, we can make this decision together.

21:46.764 --> 21:48.756
No. We can't.

21:50.059 --> 21:52.847
I have to decide for me and my brothers.

21:59.443 --> 22:00.650
Nothing back here.

22:01.237 --> 22:02.694
It's been picked over.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.363
You recognise him?

22:05.449 --> 22:07.406
I saw him the last time I came through.

22:08.452 --> 22:10.660
Been dead a while even then.

22:12.706 --> 22:13.913
I figure...

22:15.501 --> 22:17.743
that came from whoever stole his food.

22:19.296 --> 22:20.628
And that was from him.

22:26.846 --> 22:31.136
You want to know
why Sherry doesn't have her ring?

22:36.689 --> 22:38.100
She had to give it up...

22:39.358 --> 22:40.599
to save me.

22:42.278 --> 22:47.023
She chose to give up everything for me.

22:50.077 --> 22:52.615
The only reason I'm still alive
is because of her.

22:54.999 --> 22:56.535
And I owe her my life.

22:58.752 --> 23:02.962
When I left where I was,
or when I was, uh, sent away,

23:03.048 --> 23:08.214
the person who sent me away
knew all the shit I'd done, but...

23:10.014 --> 23:11.425
he knew I loved her.

23:13.475 --> 23:16.934
So he said,
"Find her. Make it right."

23:19.273 --> 23:20.309
Well...

23:21.275 --> 23:26.316
I need some of your luck, John,
because even if I can do the first thing,

23:26.405 --> 23:32.572
I don't know if I can do the second,
or, uh... or if that's even possible.

23:39.835 --> 23:40.951
Well...

23:43.005 --> 23:48.376
I think more things are possible
than impossible.

23:49.887 --> 23:52.095
Is that just
a few letters short of "honey"?

23:54.224 --> 23:56.544
- Yeah, but that doesn't mean...
- I'm gonna need a pencil.

24:07.279 --> 24:08.360
Come on.

24:18.082 --> 24:19.243
- You got it?
- Yeah.

24:22.127 --> 24:24.995
I saw Cary Grant do this in a movie once.

24:26.632 --> 24:29.340
I was always hoping to try it
when I was a cop

24:29.426 --> 24:30.962
but never got the chance.

24:33.764 --> 24:34.764
Holy shit.

24:35.849 --> 24:37.215
Extra pair of eyes.

24:41.605 --> 24:43.688
I've been looking on the wrong road
this whole time.

24:54.952 --> 24:57.114
So you're just gonna leave,
like you did before?

25:02.501 --> 25:04.083
There's no way you can carry all that.

25:13.137 --> 25:14.628
You can take one of our cars...

25:15.472 --> 25:17.179
if you tell me why you won't go with us.

25:24.148 --> 25:25.428
You're not gonna change my mind.

25:34.491 --> 25:36.171
Then it won't hurt to talk to me about it.

25:48.297 --> 25:49.378
We lived at the camp...

25:51.300 --> 25:54.509
my parents, my brothers,
and a dozen other families.

25:54.595 --> 25:57.008
We found it
shortly after everything changed.

25:57.097 --> 25:58.097
And it was pretty good.

26:00.476 --> 26:01.762
No. Um...

26:04.188 --> 26:05.224
it was perfect.

26:07.232 --> 26:10.145
It's like it was built
for exactly what was going on.

26:16.033 --> 26:17.194
And what happened?

26:22.915 --> 26:26.079
A herd of growlers followed some people
back from a scavenging run.

26:30.005 --> 26:35.046
We had routes to take,
stuff we had to do to be careful.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.762
But they weren't careful
this one time, and...

26:42.017 --> 26:43.017
that's all it took.

26:47.314 --> 26:48.555
There were so many.

26:51.860 --> 26:53.442
And they didn't look like...

26:54.822 --> 26:56.654
I don't know, regular growlers.

26:59.159 --> 27:02.323
They were from the power plant.
We just didn't know it.

27:05.124 --> 27:07.537
More showed up, but the walls held...

27:08.418 --> 27:09.418
at first.

27:12.339 --> 27:16.674
The grownups got all the weapons we had,
got ready for a fight.

27:18.512 --> 27:21.346
And when it looked like the walls
were finally about to give...

27:23.433 --> 27:24.549
they sent us away.

27:27.146 --> 27:29.763
We had a spot in the woods
we were supposed to run to

27:29.857 --> 27:31.018
if anything went bad.

27:31.608 --> 27:32.974
I took all the kids there.

27:33.068 --> 27:36.652
We had these old granola bars
stashed away, just in case.

27:37.447 --> 27:38.447
And we waited.

27:40.909 --> 27:44.653
We sat there,
eating and crying in the dark...

27:45.873 --> 27:47.330
trying to stay quiet.

27:50.919 --> 27:52.126
We'd done it before.

27:54.256 --> 27:56.669
The grownups would always come
after a night or two.

28:03.807 --> 28:04.888
But I...

28:05.976 --> 28:07.137
I just knew.

28:10.189 --> 28:13.182
And we waited and waited.

28:16.320 --> 28:18.186
And after three nights...

28:19.573 --> 28:21.360
I went back to the camp on my own.

28:24.912 --> 28:25.948
You saw them?

28:29.208 --> 28:30.824
Our parents weren't dead.

28:34.296 --> 28:37.710
They killed all the growlers.

28:40.886 --> 28:42.047
But they were sick.

28:45.265 --> 28:48.133
My mom and dad
wouldn't even let me come in the cabin.

28:51.355 --> 28:53.688
I had to talk to them through the door.

28:55.442 --> 28:58.105
They told me not to be afraid. They...

29:00.739 --> 29:03.072
They said they were going to get better.

29:09.831 --> 29:12.790
They made me promise
to stay where we were...

29:14.586 --> 29:16.077
to protect my brothers...

29:17.673 --> 29:19.380
to protect everyone else.

29:23.553 --> 29:27.388
So that... that is what I'm doing.

29:41.655 --> 29:42.771
Annie.

29:49.329 --> 29:51.616
- I get it.
- No.

29:52.291 --> 29:54.874
I get it. I really do.

30:02.426 --> 30:04.964
I think about the last thing
my mom said to me every day.

30:11.101 --> 30:13.218
So you understand why we can't leave.

30:21.778 --> 30:24.691
Just make sure you're doing
what they really asked.

30:28.035 --> 30:29.035
What does that mean?

30:31.538 --> 30:34.656
Are you surrounding yourself with the dead
to protect your brothers?

30:37.252 --> 30:40.086
Or because it's easier
than surrounding yourself with the living?

30:58.190 --> 30:59.351
They're all yours.

31:02.694 --> 31:04.606
It's up to you
whether you want to use them.

31:37.813 --> 31:38.894
John, look.

31:44.486 --> 31:45.567
Well, how 'bout that?

31:45.654 --> 31:46.654
She was here.

31:47.030 --> 31:48.271
And she might still be.

31:52.202 --> 31:53.283
I'll check the car.

32:31.450 --> 32:32.450
Hey!

32:39.624 --> 32:43.834
<i>"D, I had to kill someone.
A man back at that diner.</i>

32:43.920 --> 32:45.286
<i>He almost killed me.</i>

32:45.839 --> 32:48.627
<i>I know we've both seen so much. Too much.</i>

32:49.050 --> 32:50.862
<i>But I still don't like
the thought of you out there</i>

32:50.886 --> 32:52.752
<i>looking for me in all that death.</i>

32:53.555 --> 32:55.046
<i>I don't want that for you, D.</i>

32:55.140 --> 32:57.632
<i>I don't want you to kill yourself
trying to find me.</i>

32:58.727 --> 33:00.434
<i>I wouldn't be able to live with that,</i>

33:00.520 --> 33:03.558
<i>so I want you to stop looking for me
if you're still looking.</i>

33:04.483 --> 33:07.476
<i>I know that I gave you hope,
but now I want to give you a chance.</i>

33:07.986 --> 33:10.228
<i>I'm getting out of this place,
and so should you.</i>

33:10.697 --> 33:12.563
<i>This will be my last letter.</i>

33:13.241 --> 33:14.652
<i>Even though this is the end of us,</i>

33:14.743 --> 33:16.951
<i>please don't let this be
the end for you too.</i>

33:17.329 --> 33:21.915
<i>Find something to live for and live.
I love you forever. Honey."</i>

33:29.758 --> 33:31.750
There's another suit in the truck bed.

33:31.843 --> 33:32.843
Right.

33:33.803 --> 33:34.884
Thanks for this.

34:01.581 --> 34:03.368
The man who taught me how to use this...

34:04.292 --> 34:06.579
he helped me when I thought
that death was the only way.

34:11.757 --> 34:13.420
I thought if I felt it, if I...

34:14.511 --> 34:17.675
held the weight of it in my hands,
that I'd know what to say...

34:19.266 --> 34:20.552
to help those kids...

34:22.476 --> 34:23.592
to help you,

34:24.353 --> 34:26.641
try to show you that you are not stuck.

34:26.731 --> 34:28.597
- Morgan...
- See it feels...

34:32.070 --> 34:33.989
It feels like a piece of wood
wrapped in plastic.

34:35.739 --> 34:37.322
A piece of wood that could hurt you.

34:38.076 --> 34:39.157
Yeah.

34:43.915 --> 34:47.158
Morgan, I'm not stuck. It's just...

34:48.085 --> 34:49.202
over.

34:49.713 --> 34:51.393
- For me.
- You don't know that to be true.

34:51.422 --> 34:52.833
I have to do this.

34:53.800 --> 34:54.960
I have to give you more time.

34:56.969 --> 34:58.256
The other suit, where is it?

35:00.181 --> 35:01.342
There isn't one.

35:03.018 --> 35:04.350
Grace?

35:05.103 --> 35:06.219
Come on.

35:07.397 --> 35:08.729
You can't come with me.

35:09.774 --> 35:12.003
I'm not gonna have another person die
because of my mistakes.

35:12.027 --> 35:14.019
There's another way. All right?
There has to be.

35:14.112 --> 35:15.228
There isn't.

35:17.073 --> 35:18.905
You can talk, Morgan. You can.

35:20.076 --> 35:24.491
You're a kind and thoughtful man
who wants to earn back his mistakes.

35:24.956 --> 35:26.492
That's what you're doing out here.

35:28.585 --> 35:29.871
I'm doing the same thing.

35:37.385 --> 35:39.092
Thanks for helping me with the roadblock.

36:23.807 --> 36:24.807
Do you talk to Annie?

36:28.436 --> 36:29.768
What did she say?

36:30.188 --> 36:31.599
She thinks it's all on her.

36:34.693 --> 36:36.693
She thinks she's the only one
who can protect them.

36:37.153 --> 36:38.189
So they're gonna leave?

36:38.822 --> 36:39.858
I don't know.

36:42.283 --> 36:44.115
<i>Luciana, can you hear me?</i>

36:46.037 --> 36:47.198
Go again.

36:47.288 --> 36:48.529
<i>Luciana.</i>

36:49.416 --> 36:53.126
<i>The dulcet tones of a songbird. Luciana!</i>

36:53.211 --> 36:54.543
Strand? Where are you?

36:56.381 --> 36:58.043
Hey, I told you we'd find a way.

37:00.218 --> 37:01.379
<i>See you soon.</i>

37:02.595 --> 37:03.676
What are you talking about?

37:04.848 --> 37:06.089
<i>We've got the propellers.</i>

37:07.517 --> 37:09.884
How? Did you find a road?

37:09.978 --> 37:12.561
Roads are not a necessary ingredient
to this journey.

37:13.106 --> 37:15.393
<i>You might want to look up, to the south.</i>

37:17.277 --> 37:18.438
Here.

37:43.386 --> 37:45.002
We just need a place to set down.

37:45.388 --> 37:47.721
<i>Perhaps you can point us
toward a giant coaster.</i>

37:51.186 --> 37:54.270
<i>Sarah and Wendell are clearing
a runway back at home as we speak.</i>

37:54.939 --> 37:57.147
What...

38:02.739 --> 38:04.150
<i>Morgan, do you see it?</i>

38:06.326 --> 38:07.326
Yes, I do.

38:07.410 --> 38:08.617
Alicia.

38:09.954 --> 38:11.035
The kids...

38:12.457 --> 38:13.664
they need to see this.

38:20.048 --> 38:21.209
Hey!

38:22.217 --> 38:24.675
Annie, Max, you got to see this.

38:41.569 --> 38:43.902
<i>Are the kids there? They got eyes on it?</i>

38:43.988 --> 38:45.399
<i>They took off.</i>

38:46.533 --> 38:47.569
What? When?

38:48.243 --> 38:50.405
<i>I don't know. I'm on my way to find them.</i>

38:50.495 --> 38:53.659
You'll need to bring them back quick,
Alicia. Grace, what...

38:53.748 --> 38:56.616
what she's doing is gonna buy us time,
but not a whole lot.

39:00.672 --> 39:01.672
John!

39:06.094 --> 39:07.210
She wasn't in there, but...

39:08.721 --> 39:11.634
I found food, some supplies.

39:12.725 --> 39:14.307
- All right.
- She was here.

39:14.769 --> 39:16.806
- Yeah.
- Look, you said...

39:16.896 --> 39:19.013
when... when... when you met the others,

39:19.566 --> 39:21.432
you know,
that's when things started to click

39:21.943 --> 39:23.684
- with you finding June.
- That's right.

39:23.778 --> 39:25.735
She's close. I know it.

39:26.364 --> 39:27.842
You know, if she...
if she'd have taken off,

39:27.866 --> 39:30.859
she would have left a letter
like she always does.

39:32.328 --> 39:33.739
Did you find anything in the car?

39:37.750 --> 39:39.082
No. Nothing.

39:42.422 --> 39:43.503
Thank you.

39:44.757 --> 39:47.750
You know, this is the closest I've been
to finding Sherry in a long time.

39:50.138 --> 39:51.345
This is everything.

39:57.353 --> 39:59.015
<i>How long till you touch down?</i>

39:59.981 --> 40:02.268
<i>Sooner than we'd hoped.
We're short on fuel.</i>

40:03.067 --> 40:04.899
<i>You guys will have to come get us.</i>

40:04.986 --> 40:07.399
You got enough to clear the trees,
get to the other side?

40:10.909 --> 40:12.866
I don't know. We're trying.

40:28.009 --> 40:29.045
Whoa!

40:29.969 --> 40:31.050
Victor.

40:33.890 --> 40:35.176
<i>We have to bring it down.</i>

40:35.266 --> 40:37.679
No, not here. It's not safe.
It's contaminated.

40:38.895 --> 40:40.431
- Victor.
- It's the only way.

40:42.357 --> 40:43.973
- Victor.
- Wait.

40:44.400 --> 40:45.607
<i>Morgan. We're coming...</i>

40:46.945 --> 40:48.561
Strand! Charlie!

41:09.717 --> 41:10.717
Annie?

41:13.554 --> 41:15.841
Max? Dylan?

41:36.035 --> 41:37.321
Morgan, I'm going in.

41:46.546 --> 41:47.707
Yeah. Me too.

41:49.340 --> 41:52.754
Strand, Charlie, if you can hear me,
I'm coming.

41:52.844 --> 41:53.960
You stay where you are,

41:54.053 --> 41:55.773
but whatever you do,
don't kill any walkers.

41:56.347 --> 41:57.758
You get their blood on you...

41:59.726 --> 42:00.933
well, you could die.

42:18.327 --> 42:19.738
- Hey. You okay?
- Yeah. Are you?

42:19.829 --> 42:21.821
All right. Yeah.

42:31.591 --> 42:33.753
Morgan said to stay away from the walkers.

42:34.177 --> 42:36.920
Yeah? That could prove to be a challenge.
