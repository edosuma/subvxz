WEBVTT

00:02.770 --> 00:05.159
Previously on "Salem"...

00:07.070 --> 00:09.163
There is not a soul
who can stop me.

00:09.210 --> 00:11.360
ISAAC:
What's become of Mary?
JOHN: She's dead.

00:11.410 --> 00:13.878
For now, we go home...
for her.

00:13.910 --> 00:16.208
BOY: The terror outside
drives refugees into Salem,

00:16.250 --> 00:19.174
where, soon, they all,
including my dear father,

00:19.220 --> 00:23.543
will be but the burning candles
that ignite my inauguration.

00:23.590 --> 00:25.387
You have no idea
what you're up against.

00:25.420 --> 00:28.912
Lead the militia,
and I'll clear your name.

00:28.960 --> 00:31.520
SEBASTIAN: My sister harbors
a great danger to you, Lord --

00:31.560 --> 00:32.822
Cotton Mather.

00:32.860 --> 00:35.021
_ ANN_E:
(Sing-song vorce) Cotton.

00:35.060 --> 00:36.869
Aah!
Have no fear.

00:36.900 --> 00:38.219
It's just you
and me...

00:38.270 --> 00:39.931
(rat squeaking)
...and baby makes three.

00:39.970 --> 00:42.564
PETRUS: What you
and the Essex witches have done

00:42.610 --> 00:44.908
by bringing back
the Devil himself --

00:44.940 --> 00:46.498
now, see what I see.

00:46.540 --> 00:50.670
You and Mary Sibley
gave the Devil the earth.

00:50.710 --> 00:54.669
Now you and Mary Sibley
have got to take it back.

00:54.720 --> 00:56.347
MERCY:
Who do we have here?

00:56.390 --> 00:58.210
A little lost bird
for my little nest?

00:58.250 --> 01:01.686
You _will never have to_
deal With your uncle again.

01:01.720 --> 01:02.926
JOHN:
This is where you work?

01:02.960 --> 01:04.188
ISAAC: Knockers Hole.

01:04.230 --> 01:05.879
Does anybody know
this man's name?

01:05.930 --> 01:08.353
Finally, brother,
you are here.

01:08.400 --> 01:10.868
TITUBA: We all know that
this is our only chance.

01:10.900 --> 01:12.128
Raise the dead,

01:12.170 --> 01:14.297
and you never know
what you raise.

01:14.340 --> 01:16.535
(Mary screeches)

01:16.570 --> 01:18.731
(breathing heavily)

01:20.080 --> 01:22.207
(breathing heavily)

01:22.250 --> 01:24.241
John.

01:24.280 --> 01:26.043
No!

01:26.080 --> 01:30.141
(panﬁng)

01:31.750 --> 01:34.787
John!

01:34.820 --> 01:36.822
John?

01:36.860 --> 01:38.589
John!

01:38.630 --> 01:40.598
John, where are you?

01:40.630 --> 01:43.428
I'm here, John.

01:43.470 --> 01:45.927
Where is he?

01:45.970 --> 01:48.131
(panﬁng)

01:55.840 --> 01:57.774
No!
I'm sorry, Sister.

01:57.810 --> 02:00.449
No,
get out of my way!

02:00.480 --> 02:02.516
(panﬁng)

02:11.460 --> 02:13.894
(growling, shouting)

02:18.870 --> 02:20.792
Shh, Shh.

02:20.840 --> 02:23.308
(panﬁng)

02:26.180 --> 02:30.674
What have you done
to me now, Queen of Bitches?

02:30.710 --> 02:34.714
Only ripped your soul
through the wall of silence,

02:34.750 --> 02:37.184
cursed you back to life,

02:37.220 --> 02:42.180
and trapped you forever
in the home of all your tears.

02:42.230 --> 02:46.223
Run as far and as fast
as you may, Mary Sibley.

02:46.260 --> 02:47.921
You can never escape Salem.

02:50.270 --> 02:54.297
ESSEX ELDER: You are resurrected
by the very life force

02:54.340 --> 02:56.865
of the primordial tree.

02:56.910 --> 03:00.732
Now you are forever bound
to the realm of its roots --

03:00.780 --> 03:02.133
to Salem.

03:02.180 --> 03:05.149
Is this now
to be my personal Hell?

03:05.180 --> 03:08.513
Have you brought me back
and staked my soul

03:08.550 --> 03:10.643
to Salem
just to watch me suffer?

03:10.690 --> 03:12.351
No, child.

03:12.390 --> 03:15.757
'Tis no punishment,
but a gift.

03:15.790 --> 03:20.750
You've been given the chance
to undo all your crimes.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.927
My crimes?

03:22.970 --> 03:26.758
Why, you lying,
filthy whore!

03:26.800 --> 03:30.065
My crimes
are your crimes.

03:30.110 --> 03:33.375
We are all responsible.

03:33.410 --> 03:37.608
Together, we turned the
witch hunt against the hunters.

03:37.650 --> 03:40.414
And we sought justice
for all our sisters

03:40.450 --> 03:43.010
burned and hanged
in the old country.

03:43.050 --> 03:45.348
But the devil lied,

03:45.390 --> 03:48.780
and he delivers justice
only for himself

03:48.820 --> 03:51.618
and death or slavery
for all others.

03:51.660 --> 03:54.527
It is true.
I have seen it.

03:54.560 --> 03:56.562
The devil
we led you to birth

03:56.600 --> 03:59.262
will enslave this land
unless we stop hIm.

03:59.300 --> 04:00.562
We must --
We? We?!

04:00.600 --> 04:01.794
No.

04:01.840 --> 04:03.262
No, if you want to undo
all of this,

04:03.310 --> 04:05.699
then you will have
to undo it without me!

04:05.740 --> 04:07.708
You are the only one

04:07.740 --> 04:11.141
in Heaven or Earth
who can destroy him.

04:11.180 --> 04:14.274
You and he
were of one body.

04:14.320 --> 04:16.641
You knitted his flesh
in your womb.

04:16.690 --> 04:20.581
I already saved the one person
in this world I loved.

04:20.620 --> 04:22.087
Well,
I'm sorry to tell you,

04:22.120 --> 04:25.556
but your sacrifice accomplished
precisely nothing --

04:25.590 --> 04:29.299
saved no one,
least of all John Alden.

04:29.330 --> 04:33.039
**

04:44.780 --> 04:47.749
(gasps)

04:47.780 --> 04:50.442
If you want to save
the life of your love,

04:50.490 --> 04:53.653
it is not enough
to kill yourself.

04:53.690 --> 04:55.851
You must kill your son.

05:00.960 --> 05:03.394
("Cupid Carries A Gun" plays)

05:08.470 --> 05:11.530
* Pound me the witch drums

05:11.570 --> 05:12.969
* The witch drums

05:13.010 --> 05:16.844
* Pound me the witch drums

05:16.880 --> 05:19.474
* Pound me the witch drums

05:19.520 --> 05:21.215
* The witch drums

05:21.250 --> 05:23.480
* Better pray for hell

05:23.520 --> 05:29.459
* Not hallelujah

05:29.490 --> 05:32.493
**

05:45.740 --> 05:48.208
You stupid waste
of flesh and blood.

05:48.240 --> 05:50.674
I didn't kill Mary.
I saved her.

05:50.710 --> 05:53.144
(both panting)

05:53.180 --> 05:54.716
What --

05:54.750 --> 05:57.913
by bleeding her dry through
a goddamn hole in her neck?

05:57.950 --> 05:59.759
You didn't deserve it.

05:59.790 --> 06:01.314
What?

06:01.360 --> 06:03.419
I left her
blood enough to survive,

06:03.460 --> 06:07.021
to be free of Salem --
free of me, even.

06:07.060 --> 06:10.564
She must have found you clinging
to your pathetic life

06:10.600 --> 06:13.831
and wasted her last precious
life's blood to save you.

06:13.870 --> 06:17.101
You killed her,
Captain,

06:17.140 --> 06:20.507
as if
you cut her throat.

06:20.540 --> 06:22.679
You should have had
the decency

06:22.710 --> 06:24.871
to let _them _
hang you this morning.

06:24.910 --> 06:26.138
HATHORNE: Gentlemen!

06:27.480 --> 06:29.846
Gentlemen, please!

06:29.890 --> 06:35.681
Salem's survival rests
on the shoulders of two men.

06:35.720 --> 06:37.426
And I can't afford
either of you

06:37.460 --> 06:40.429
to reduce that number
by half.

06:40.460 --> 06:44.294
Captain Alden,
you promised me trained troops.

06:44.330 --> 06:45.558
We need them.

06:45.600 --> 06:48.569
The enemy may be
at our very gates.

06:48.600 --> 06:52.229
Not_ all enemies
are In the woods.

06:52.270 --> 06:55.603
**

06:58.680 --> 07:01.148
(indistinct conversations)

07:03.520 --> 07:07.479
So, this is
what it all comes to.

07:07.520 --> 07:11.627
The great hope of generations
of Cottons and Mathers,

07:11.660 --> 07:17.860
reduced to a hand puppet
of Witches and demon lovers.

07:19.700 --> 07:23.568
(trembling)

07:23.610 --> 07:25.237
Please.

07:25.270 --> 07:26.476
Let me.

07:26.510 --> 07:28.171
No.

07:28.210 --> 07:32.306
I cannot -- I will not --
allow you destroy yourself,

07:32.350 --> 07:35.319
nor will I allow them
to destroy you.

07:35.350 --> 07:37.318
(sighs)

07:37.350 --> 07:42.151
Time will show us the way
if you will but let it.

07:42.190 --> 07:44.681
Our true marriage
has not yet begun.

07:44.730 --> 07:47.221
The children
we might have --

07:51.730 --> 07:54.130
If you wish me
to endure, I need a drink.

07:54.170 --> 07:57.662
And drown poor Brown Jenkins?
I think not.

08:05.010 --> 08:10.687
You do not understand _
the danger you -- we all are In.

08:10.720 --> 08:14.315
The power that now rules Salem
is far greater than mine

08:14.360 --> 08:19.059
and utterly evil
in its intent.

08:19.090 --> 08:23.322
You must trust that all I do,
I do for you --

08:23.370 --> 08:26.498
for your protection,
our future.

08:26.540 --> 08:30.135
I am in your hands.

08:30.170 --> 08:32.809
Not hers, but in the hands
of the Dark Lord.

08:32.840 --> 08:34.239
Lay a finger on Cotton

08:34.280 --> 08:35.679
and I will paint these walls
with your insides.

08:35.710 --> 08:37.701
That boy be damned.

08:37.750 --> 08:39.911
Our little master
simply has use of your husband.

08:39.950 --> 08:42.680
The people are afraid.

08:42.720 --> 08:45.041
They need to hear from the great
Reverend Cotton Mather.

08:45.090 --> 08:47.354
What does the Devil care
If people are afraid?

08:47.390 --> 08:49.722
Even
the dimmest butcher knows

08:49.760 --> 08:52.081
not to let the cow see
the blow that is coming.

08:52.130 --> 08:55.497
Fear taints the meat.

08:55.530 --> 08:59.068
I will not serve him.

08:59.100 --> 09:01.864
I'd rather die instead.

09:01.900 --> 09:05.438
I would do so in an instant
were I allowed.

09:05.470 --> 09:07.734
SEBASTIAN:
I'm not sure I believe you.

09:07.780 --> 09:10.544
I think you and I
are more alike than that.

09:10.580 --> 09:13.413
And we both know
that martyrdom is for fools

09:13.450 --> 09:15.179
who dream
of a glorious death

09:15.220 --> 09:17.586
_ that will ensure
their memory lives forever.

09:17.620 --> 09:21.386
Personally, I'd prefer
it were not my memory

09:21.420 --> 09:23.581
that lives forever,
but me.

09:23.630 --> 09:27.157
And I think deep down,
you are the same.

09:32.840 --> 09:37.265
IfI am wrong and you do wish
to martyr yourself,

09:37.310 --> 09:40.529
you will have that chance
in the meeting house.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.741
Say the wrong thing,
and you will die.

09:42.780 --> 09:45.704
Say the right thing,
and you will live.

09:45.750 --> 09:49.242
Either way,
the cattle shall still be eaten.

09:49.280 --> 09:52.147
_ Just serve him
in the most minimal of ways,

09:52.190 --> 09:53.418
and he will allow you
and my sister

09:53.460 --> 09:55.815
to live
happily ever after.

09:55.860 --> 09:58.579
This is our chance.

10:00.360 --> 10:02.328
Chance?
(door closes)

10:02.360 --> 10:03.793
(scoffs)

10:03.830 --> 10:06.958
A chance to destroy
everything I've lived for.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.888
You would have me be
a Judas Goat

10:08.940 --> 10:10.965
and lead my own people
to slaughter.

10:11.010 --> 10:14.002
No,
I would have you live.

10:19.210 --> 10:23.089
DINLEY: Most men die
as they are born -- in agony,

10:23.120 --> 10:28.012
but this man's agony
must have been exceptional.

10:28.060 --> 10:31.223
Every bone in his body...

10:34.200 --> 10:35.929
...has been crushed.

10:35.960 --> 10:37.860
A suspicious death,
then?

10:37.900 --> 10:41.961
Well, in Knockers Hole,
all deaths are suspicious.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.865
Why care
about this one?

10:43.910 --> 10:47.334
Every man --
even a poor man,

10:47.380 --> 10:50.872
even a bad man --
deserves dignity in death.

10:50.910 --> 10:52.775
I think dignity begins
with a name.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.708
That I could give you.

10:54.750 --> 10:57.184
Stitched him up
more than once.

10:57.220 --> 11:03.352
Nick Land -- a gambler,
a thief, a drunkard, and pimp.

11:03.390 --> 11:05.358
Did he have any family?

11:05.390 --> 11:06.857
Alice.

11:06.900 --> 11:09.289
I can assure you
she won't be shedding any tears.

11:09.330 --> 11:10.820
Why not?

11:10.870 --> 11:15.398
I said that he was a pimp --
her pimp.

11:20.410 --> 11:22.605
(sighing)

11:28.020 --> 11:31.683
I have better use
for those precious hands.

11:33.620 --> 11:35.258
Mary!

11:38.360 --> 11:40.328
No, it cannot be.

11:40.360 --> 11:42.419
But it is,
my love.

11:42.460 --> 11:44.189
How?

11:44.230 --> 11:47.393
I buried you.

11:47.440 --> 11:51.206
**

11:55.280 --> 11:57.840
I've seen
the other side, John.

11:57.880 --> 12:00.178
There's no life there,
no love.

12:00.220 --> 12:03.940
_ All we have
is here and now.

12:05.490 --> 12:07.412
Fine,
then come away.

12:07.460 --> 12:09.553
We can escape
before anyone's even awake.

12:09.590 --> 12:11.421
John,
I can never leave this place.

12:11.460 --> 12:14.190
The magic that raised me
traps me here.

12:14.230 --> 12:17.222
I must spend
the rest of my life in Salem.

12:17.270 --> 12:19.625
Whatever you must do,
we do it together.

12:19.670 --> 12:22.366
Tell me.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.038
There will be time
to talk of that.

12:24.070 --> 12:28.302
For now,
it is not talk I need.

12:28.340 --> 12:29.739
John.

12:29.780 --> 12:32.374
I've swum beyond
the wall of sleep.

12:32.410 --> 12:36.073
I've been alive and dead
and then alive again.

12:36.120 --> 12:41.319
And right now, all I want
is to feel you inside me.

12:41.360 --> 12:43.828
Can you do that?

12:43.860 --> 12:45.851
(both breathing heavily)

12:50.930 --> 12:55.162
Let _the Devil rule _
the world just one more night.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.361
(both breathing heavily)

13:00.980 --> 13:03.005
(both moaning)

13:03.050 --> 13:06.144
**

13:15.390 --> 13:18.553
**

13:19.560 --> 13:22.427
Where are you going?

13:22.460 --> 13:25.759
Where only I can go.

13:25.800 --> 13:27.131
No.

13:27.170 --> 13:28.694
Not alone.

13:28.740 --> 13:30.708
You can't help me, John.

13:30.740 --> 13:32.162
I made that boy's body.

13:32.210 --> 13:33.632
Only I can unmake him.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.705
You said you'd tell me all,
that there'd be time.

13:35.740 --> 13:38.470
I lied.

13:38.510 --> 13:42.219
There's no time --
no time at all.

13:42.250 --> 13:47.051
IfI succeed, then we'll have
all the time in the world.

13:47.090 --> 13:51.026
IfI fail...

13:51.060 --> 13:53.449
then at least
I felt your love in me

13:53.500 --> 13:55.559
once
before the darkness fell.

13:58.030 --> 13:59.793
I'm

13:59.830 --> 14:04.699
Perhaps it was selfish of me
to come here.

14:04.740 --> 14:10.372
Then again, that's me.

14:10.410 --> 14:13.743
By the power
of the love I crave,

14:13.780 --> 14:17.238
glamour me one who's crawled
from the grave.

14:17.290 --> 14:20.418

14:33.040 --> 14:36.237
Flee, or it won't be alms
you'll be begging for.

14:36.270 --> 14:37.862
It'll be mercy.

14:37.910 --> 14:40.037
I am no beggar, sir.

14:40.080 --> 14:44.198
I am his mother,
and I want to see my son.

14:51.150 --> 14:55.211
I swear there was
no such hallway in my house.

14:57.260 --> 15:00.457

15:02.560 --> 15:06.462
It is not your house now,
but his.

15:22.350 --> 15:24.489
(indistinct conversations)

15:47.340 --> 15:49.331
Is this
Nick Land's room?

15:54.680 --> 15:56.819
You must be Alice.

15:56.850 --> 15:59.614
I'm sorry
for your loss.

15:59.650 --> 16:01.584
My loss?

16:01.620 --> 16:03.326
Which one?

16:03.360 --> 16:04.759
My parents?

16:04.790 --> 16:06.519
My maidenhood?
Your uncle.

16:06.560 --> 16:10.223
That was no loss...
to me or anyone else.

16:12.330 --> 16:14.195
I've no time to talk of him with
you. Now, if you'll excuse me.

16:14.240 --> 16:16.868
I found your uncle's body
on the street.

16:16.900 --> 16:20.575
Pigs chewing
on his flesh.

16:24.550 --> 16:26.541
I've got a new home...

16:26.580 --> 16:29.674
and somebody
who cares about me.

16:33.360 --> 16:36.989
Maybe he jumped out --

16:37.030 --> 16:40.022
ashamed of all the misery
he caused me.

16:40.060 --> 16:44.394
Yeah, maybe.

16:44.430 --> 16:47.365
If I was to jump out
of a window...

16:51.210 --> 16:54.407
...I think
I'd open the window first.

16:54.440 --> 16:56.533
But then, that's just...

17:10.630 --> 17:14.418
**

17:27.540 --> 17:29.838
Do not commit suicide

17:29.880 --> 17:32.405
for the sake of your name
or your pride.

17:32.450 --> 17:35.669
You would have me
act a foul play

17:35.720 --> 17:37.688
written by
the Devil himself.

17:37.720 --> 17:39.415
Yes...

17:42.760 --> 17:45.126
...if it means
you surwve.

17:45.160 --> 17:47.253
But as what?

17:47.300 --> 17:53.068
Some weak shadow of a man
wearing this sad suit of flesh.

17:55.170 --> 17:58.059
I know you will do what
you will, no matter the cost.

18:01.510 --> 18:04.308
I hope against hope
that you choose me.

18:07.750 --> 18:09.638
Choose life.

18:09.680 --> 18:12.843
**

18:27.140 --> 18:31.429
TITUBA: She always leaves
the head and the heart spinning.

18:34.710 --> 18:36.473
Where is she?

18:36.510 --> 18:38.501
Stalking the halls
of that house,

18:38.550 --> 18:41.644
waiting for a moment alone
with the thing that was her son.

18:43.190 --> 18:45.146
(scoffs)

18:45.190 --> 18:47.988
She has little enough
chance of success.

18:48.020 --> 18:50.523
Anything you do
will only lessen it.

18:52.360 --> 18:56.626
If you ever want to see her
again, you must listen to me.

18:56.660 --> 18:59.959
And why on Earth
would I believe a word you say?

19:00.000 --> 19:04.130
Because she believed me
when I spoke of you.

19:04.170 --> 19:07.708
How do you think
I got her to come back here?

19:07.740 --> 19:09.435
You used
her love for me

19:09.480 --> 19:13.109
to make her ri_sk her life
yet again?

19:13.150 --> 19:16.540
You conniving bitch.

19:16.580 --> 19:19.981
I'm afraid I'm not here,
but well-hidden.

19:20.020 --> 19:22.011
If he knew
that we plot against him,

19:22.060 --> 19:24.824
Mary's life
would be forfeit.

19:24.860 --> 19:27.624
Fine, you hide.
I'll go get her out of there.

19:27.660 --> 19:30.220
If you love her,
trust her and trust me.

19:30.270 --> 19:33.569
I do love her,
and I'm trying to trust her.

19:33.600 --> 19:34.828
But trust you?

19:34.870 --> 19:37.566
Neven
How frustrating.

19:37.610 --> 19:40.238
I must save the world
through two stubborn fools

19:40.280 --> 19:42.271
that only want
to save each other.

19:45.750 --> 19:48.218
What do you want
from me?

19:48.250 --> 19:51.708
You have already seen
that it is no ordinary war

19:51.750 --> 19:53.388
blazing outside of Salem.

19:53.420 --> 19:56.548
While she wages war
on the inside,

19:56.590 --> 20:00.048
you must do the same
on the outside as a soldier.

20:00.090 --> 20:02.820
And you must make these lambs
into soldiers, too.

20:02.860 --> 20:05.795
_ For the real war
is only just beginning.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.392
(warbling)

20:21.580 --> 20:23.980
(door opens)

20:25.950 --> 20:28.748
Mom.

20:28.790 --> 20:31.156
(sighs)

20:32.260 --> 20:35.252
I climbed over
the black wall of sleep

20:35.300 --> 20:41.193
and crawled from my grave
because I cannot deny the truth.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.094
You are my son,

20:43.140 --> 20:46.860
and we belong together
until the end.

20:46.910 --> 20:50.038
How long I've waited
for you to say those words,

20:50.080 --> 20:53.572
and I promise you
we shall be so happy.

20:53.620 --> 20:57.716
Just being here
and holding you,

20:57.750 --> 20:59.809
I already am.

21:03.760 --> 21:07.184
**

21:10.000 --> 21:12.218
SENTINEL: So, it's true.

21:12.270 --> 21:15.592
This is the pretty little sow

21:15.640 --> 21:19.337
blessed with birthing
our new world.

21:27.280 --> 21:29.271

21:35.120 --> 21:36.781
Whatever
the Captain's drinking.

21:36.820 --> 21:38.356
Aye, sir.

21:46.070 --> 21:49.437
To Captain John Alden --
hero of Bloody Brook,

21:49.470 --> 21:52.598
the Great Swamp, Turner's Falls,
and Mount Hope.

21:52.640 --> 21:54.631
To your honor, Sir.

21:54.680 --> 21:56.500
You're full of shit,
little man,

21:56.540 --> 21:59.145
and so are
your fairy tales.

21:59.180 --> 22:02.377
There weren't any heroes
at any of those battles,

22:02.420 --> 22:05.389
least of all me.

22:05.420 --> 22:09.686
Only difference between me
and everyone else there is...

22:09.720 --> 22:13.895
I'm still alive,
more or less.

22:13.930 --> 22:17.696
An interesting way you have
of inspiring your troops.

22:17.730 --> 22:18.958
My troops?

22:19.000 --> 22:21.662
I didn't save your neck
from the rope

22:21.700 --> 22:26.137
for you to keep Mr. Lamb's
pocket full from your drinking.

22:26.170 --> 22:28.070
I look_forward
to your first muster.

22:28.110 --> 22:31.500
Today, Captain.

22:43.460 --> 22:47.692
So, will the great Cotton Mather
bend to my needs?

22:47.730 --> 22:50.767
Well, he is a proud
and stubborn man --

22:50.800 --> 22:52.324
from an all-too-long line

22:52.370 --> 22:55.237
of proudly stubborn
Puritans, but...

22:55.270 --> 22:59.434
ifI were a betting man,
and I am,

22:59.470 --> 23:00.698
I would lay gold
that my sister

23:00.740 --> 23:03.607
is a widow
before the day's done.

23:03.650 --> 23:06.505
Should be delightful
entertainment either way.

23:06.550 --> 23:09.747
**

23:58.830 --> 24:00.661
Yes.

24:00.700 --> 24:02.930
The mystical chords
of mother love

24:02.970 --> 24:05.109
have drawn
our beloved Mary back to us.

24:07.540 --> 24:11.647
Certainly you share my joy
at her return?

24:11.680 --> 24:13.819
Yes.

24:13.850 --> 24:16.148
Yes, of course.

24:16.180 --> 24:18.944
You _cannot lose
what is truly yours.

24:18.990 --> 24:23.381
Goes for my mother, and indeed
this entire earth, I believe.

24:34.340 --> 24:38.436
I cannot fathom how,
but it is true.

24:38.470 --> 24:41.530
You came back.
Not for you --
for my son.

24:43.680 --> 24:45.204
Even I am not vain enough

24:45.250 --> 24:48.617
to think the sun rises
for me alone.

24:48.650 --> 24:52.643
But I am grateful beyond relief
that it has risen.

24:57.730 --> 25:00.858
Had I more than one life,
I might well spend it with you,

25:00.900 --> 25:04.688
but I have but this one
and it is his.

25:04.730 --> 25:06.618
Come.

25:06.670 --> 25:09.138
Time for us to collect your
sister and her good man.

25:09.170 --> 25:13.539
Besides, my dear mother
and my most trusted friend

25:13.580 --> 25:16.208
have so much to discuss.

25:24.020 --> 25:25.988
ISAAC: Far as I can tell,
Alice Land --

25:26.020 --> 25:27.681
VVho?

25:27.720 --> 25:29.688
The niece of the dead man
recently joined a brothel.

25:29.720 --> 25:32.689
Seems a new proprietor
has been recruiting
girls off the streets.

25:32.730 --> 25:35.927
Indeed.
And when the_uncle to_ok
exception to losmg his niece,

25:35.960 --> 25:37.825
his only source
of income,

25:37.870 --> 25:41.397
someone, probably the brothel's
new master, did him in.

25:41.440 --> 25:43.931
The denizens
of Knockers Hole

25:43.970 --> 25:47.201
are more animal
than human.

25:47.240 --> 25:51.279
No one can be surprised
at their doings.

25:51.310 --> 25:53.346
(chuckles lightly)

25:53.380 --> 25:55.075
But what about
Nick Land?

25:55.120 --> 25:57.918
He will be
just as dead tomorrow.

25:57.950 --> 26:00.612
In the meantime,
I will see to this matter,

26:00.660 --> 26:04.448
the brothel in Salem,
myself.

26:04.490 --> 26:06.720
(indistinct conversations)

26:14.470 --> 26:16.563
(violin playing)

26:31.750 --> 26:34.480
Welcome to
my Bird's Nest.

26:34.520 --> 26:37.080
Do you see any birds you'd like
to share a nest with?

26:37.120 --> 26:38.485
That won't be necessary.

26:38.530 --> 26:40.555
Strictly business,
Madame --

26:40.590 --> 26:42.797
the kind that's best
discussed privately,

26:42.830 --> 26:45.594
unless, of course,
you'd like to find

26:45.630 --> 26:48.428
my militia here
in the morning.

26:50.170 --> 26:51.706
Well, shall we?

26:53.810 --> 26:55.835
Uh, for a poor mistress,

26:55.880 --> 26:57.802
you've obviously done well
for yourself here,

26:57.850 --> 26:59.738
and in
such a short time.

26:59.780 --> 27:02.169
There is gold
in men's lust.

27:02.220 --> 27:03.778
And there has been,
shall we say,

27:03.820 --> 27:06.641
considerable pent-up demand
in Salem.

27:06.690 --> 27:07.918
Pent-up demand?

27:07.960 --> 27:09.257
(chuckling) Indeed.
Yes.

27:09.290 --> 27:11.326
A woman_
who knows busmess.

27:11.360 --> 27:13.954
Please,
how can I serve you?

27:14.000 --> 27:17.458
I had, shall we say,
an arrangement

27:17.500 --> 27:19.263
with your predecessor...

27:19.300 --> 27:20.961
May he rest in pieces.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.592
...and would be prepared
to offer

27:22.640 --> 27:27.304
your charming establishment
the same generous protection,

27:27.340 --> 27:29.479
solong
as a fair percentage flows

27:29.510 --> 27:33.503
towards the brothel's
new benefactor -- i.e. myself.

27:33.550 --> 27:35.609
And what does your honor think
is a fair percentage?

27:35.650 --> 27:38.016
Well, I am by no means
a greedy man.

27:38.050 --> 27:41.110
Let's say, perhaps, 50%?

27:41.160 --> 27:42.650
50%?

27:42.690 --> 27:44.180
Mm-hmm.

27:44.230 --> 27:45.720
How about 30%?

27:45.760 --> 27:47.227
How about 60%?

27:47.260 --> 27:48.488
400/0.

27:48.530 --> 27:50.623
700/0.

27:50.660 --> 27:52.161
That is no way
to bargain.

27:52.200 --> 27:54.134
You are going
the wrong way.

27:54.170 --> 27:56.331
I never bargain.

27:56.440 --> 27:58.829
50% it is.

27:58.870 --> 28:01.475
(sighs)

28:01.510 --> 28:05.401
It will be an honor,
and indeed a pleasure,

28:05.450 --> 28:09.216
to be partnered with a man
as firm and hard

28:09.250 --> 28:11.241
in his dealings as you.

28:14.890 --> 28:16.881
To the love
of busmess.

28:16.920 --> 28:19.184
And the business of love.

28:19.230 --> 28:20.424
Mm.

28:20.460 --> 28:22.451
(chuckles)

28:23.800 --> 28:25.028
Mmm.

Who's next?

30:46.070 --> 30:50.632
Now, you -- I remember you.

30:50.680 --> 30:52.375
(groaning)

31:02.860 --> 31:04.748
You.

31:04.790 --> 31:07.054
(sighs)
You fight well alone.

31:07.090 --> 31:09.058
That'll keep you alive.

31:09.100 --> 31:10.590
Already has.

31:10.630 --> 31:12.825
Been alone all my life.

31:12.870 --> 31:14.531
Yeah.

31:14.570 --> 31:17.095
(groans)

31:19.970 --> 31:23.030
MAN:
(speaking indistinctly)

31:29.450 --> 31:31.680
MAN #2:
Step inside, please.

31:31.720 --> 31:35.087
(indistinct conversations)

31:35.120 --> 31:39.250
SENTINEL: I see you
hiding there behind your eyes.

31:39.290 --> 31:42.953
(groans)

31:43.000 --> 31:46.766
Did you really think you could
just walk back in here?

31:46.800 --> 31:48.597
No.

31:48.640 --> 31:49.959
No, I knew
there would be questions.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.399
Good.

31:51.440 --> 31:55.103
Questions there certainly
will be, and pain.

31:55.140 --> 31:57.233
(groans)

31:59.750 --> 32:03.709
Questions
not backed up by pain

32:03.750 --> 32:07.242
are like tin coins.

32:07.290 --> 32:09.554
You can press
a king's face upon them,

32:09.590 --> 32:12.229
but they remain worthless --
no gold in them.

32:12.260 --> 32:15.252
It is gold
that I want --

32:15.300 --> 32:19.896
your golden truth
and your true pain.

32:19.930 --> 32:23.036
**

32:29.640 --> 32:33.679
Now tell me
how you came to be here.

32:33.710 --> 32:37.146
The Countess Marburg
ordered me dead.

32:37.180 --> 32:41.253
Her son, the Baron --
Sebastian -- tricked her,

32:41.290 --> 32:43.918
left me just enough blood
to survive.

32:43.960 --> 32:46.849
But...?

32:46.890 --> 32:50.496
I gave what remained
to save the man I loved,

32:50.530 --> 32:53.966
but I wanted to live
for an even greater love.

32:54.000 --> 32:57.037
I crawled out of the dirt
into the moonlight,

32:57.070 --> 32:59.834
and back to Salem.

32:59.870 --> 33:02.179
Back to your lover.

33:02.210 --> 33:05.441
Only to say goodbye
to him.

33:05.480 --> 33:07.801
Why?

33:07.850 --> 33:12.810
Not all loves
are created equal.

33:12.850 --> 33:15.978
I am no longer just a woman
but a mother,

33:16.020 --> 33:18.386
and my love
belongs to my child.

33:18.430 --> 33:22.127
He exists no more.

33:22.160 --> 33:25.368
My mother's heart
denies it with every beat.

33:25.400 --> 33:27.868
My son
is still there.

33:27.900 --> 33:30.630
I will not leave him
a motherless child.

33:30.670 --> 33:34.071
Motherless child?

33:34.110 --> 33:38.501
You really have no idea
what he is --

33:38.550 --> 33:41.713
what we are.

33:41.750 --> 33:46.244
I can assure you neither of us
have ever been children.

33:46.290 --> 33:49.782
We were never even born.

33:54.560 --> 33:56.425
What are you?

33:56.460 --> 34:00.760
God's first creation...

34:00.800 --> 34:04.759
and his most enduring.

34:04.810 --> 34:07.699
And we have met before.

34:07.740 --> 34:10.208
Neven

34:10.240 --> 34:12.401
Seven years ago

34:12.450 --> 34:16.875
when the Dark Lord's vessel
was taken from your womb.

34:16.920 --> 34:19.081
You cried for help.

34:19.120 --> 34:22.283
I came
in a multitude.

34:22.320 --> 34:25.448
The ground around you
opened up,

34:25.490 --> 34:29.551
and a swarm of insects
crawled up through the earth

34:29.600 --> 34:33.525
onto your stomach
and across your chest.

34:33.570 --> 34:35.959
They are me.

34:36.000 --> 34:39.128
I and the swarm
are the same.

34:39.170 --> 34:45.200
My thousands of legs
have crawled across your flesh.

34:45.250 --> 34:49.414
One day,
I will burrow deep...

34:49.450 --> 34:51.645
and devour you.

34:54.760 --> 35:00.050
Now I will know
the whole truth.

35:00.090 --> 35:03.253
**

35:04.800 --> 35:06.722
(gasping)

35:08.770 --> 35:10.863
(whimpering)

35:12.840 --> 35:15.673
(screaming)

35:19.610 --> 35:24.616
What is the opposite
of a miracle?

35:26.720 --> 35:31.783
A force beyond human
or natural power,

35:31.830 --> 35:35.197
but not, as in a miracle,
for good,

35:35.230 --> 35:38.165
but for evil.

35:38.200 --> 35:43.695
Not to spread faith,
but to spread terror.

35:45.640 --> 35:49.770
Inexplicable flames that
blackened this Meeting House,

35:49.810 --> 35:54.270
the very heart of Salem,
was just that --

35:54.320 --> 35:58.848
a miracle of evil,

35:58.890 --> 36:03.111
an act of terror,

36:03.160 --> 36:06.129
a warning shot
from an enemy far darker

36:06.160 --> 36:08.526
than Salem has yet seen.

36:08.560 --> 36:10.755
(chuckles)

36:12.570 --> 36:16.734
This boy is not what he seems.

36:20.370 --> 36:23.430
This...

36:29.350 --> 36:33.411
...Child...

36:33.450 --> 36:37.989
is God's lesson to us all.

36:38.020 --> 36:42.423
His own family
slaughtered by savages --

36:42.460 --> 36:46.863
taken captive, tortured,
abandoned

36:46.900 --> 36:49.937
until our late,
lamented founder, George Sibley,

36:49.970 --> 36:53.599
ransomed him
into the arms of Salem,

36:53.640 --> 36:56.529
into his own home!

36:56.580 --> 37:00.209
And now -- and now this...

37:00.250 --> 37:04.619
best-of-all boys...

37:04.650 --> 37:08.211
has dedicated his fortune
from our beloved founder

37:08.260 --> 37:11.081
to the future of Salem,

37:11.120 --> 37:15.454
starting with the restoration
of our beloved Meeting House!

37:15.500 --> 37:17.525
(indistinct conversations)

37:17.560 --> 37:19.096
And that is just the beginning.

37:19.130 --> 37:22.691
With his noble guardian,
the Baron Marburg,

37:22.740 --> 37:25.629
little Sibley is dedicated
to growing and rebuilding

37:25.670 --> 37:30.369
Salem until it truly is
what we came here to build --

37:30.410 --> 37:33.971
new Jerusalem!

37:34.010 --> 37:37.411
(cheers and applause)

37:45.460 --> 37:49.351
**

37:53.800 --> 37:56.030
(indistinct conversations)

38:01.940 --> 38:04.500
Well-done, Reverend.
Thank you.

38:04.550 --> 38:07.246
Thank you.

38:07.280 --> 38:10.078
Inspirational words.

38:10.120 --> 38:11.747
What's wrong with you?

38:11.790 --> 38:14.657
Whatever do you mean?

38:14.690 --> 38:16.817
It is one thing
to lay low.

38:16.860 --> 38:18.350
It's something else to do
the Devil's work for him.

38:18.390 --> 38:20.529
My work
has not changed.

38:20.560 --> 38:22.528
I am now, as always,

38:22.560 --> 38:25.620
serving the greatest good
and the glory of God.

38:25.670 --> 38:28.332
Tell me the truth.

38:28.370 --> 38:31.339
Your wife have your balls
in a box?

38:34.410 --> 38:36.503
Leave my wife
out of it.

38:36.540 --> 38:39.771
We both know
what your wife is.

38:39.810 --> 38:41.778
What the hell
are you now?

38:41.820 --> 38:43.219
(scoffs)

38:43.250 --> 38:45.684
As an unmarried man,
you cannot hope to understand

38:45.720 --> 38:48.416
the unbreakable bonds
that hold a man to his wife.

38:53.730 --> 38:56.028
I hope
that we remain friends.

38:56.060 --> 38:59.188
**

39:14.580 --> 39:16.548
(gagging)

39:31.230 --> 39:34.358
**

39:46.780 --> 39:50.079
Now you can hide nothing
from me.

39:50.120 --> 39:53.544
I shall taste
your truth.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.934
Ah, 'tis true --

40:11.970 --> 40:16.202
Venus' curse is_as harsh
as her glove is soft.

40:16.240 --> 40:18.606
Dinley,
you bloviating blowhard,

40:18.650 --> 40:21.244
shut up
and tell me what it is!

40:24.280 --> 40:26.544
I've seen
a lot of canker blossoms

40:26.590 --> 40:30.913
since the new brothel's opened,
but nothing quite like this.

40:30.960 --> 40:34.657
Let me see
what I've got.

40:34.700 --> 40:36.554
We're gonna need something
to relieve the itch

40:36.600 --> 40:39.194
and something
to lessen the stench.

40:43.470 --> 40:46.769
(strained)
This is your work!

40:49.040 --> 40:51.645
What have you done
to me?

40:51.680 --> 40:54.103
Quite simply put,
I've killed you.

40:54.150 --> 40:57.142
Not to worry --
you don't have to die today

40:57.180 --> 40:59.819
or tomorrow.

40:59.850 --> 41:01.488
I have an antidote.

41:05.330 --> 41:07.218
Right here.

41:08.530 --> 41:09.997
Would you like some?

41:10.030 --> 41:11.292
Give it to me.

41:11.330 --> 41:13.798
No!
(chuckles)

41:13.830 --> 41:18.506
Then we must begin
as we mean to continue.

41:18.540 --> 41:20.758
On your knees.

41:20.810 --> 41:23.028
(birds squawking)

41:27.550 --> 41:29.871
(groaning, gagging)

41:36.360 --> 41:39.329
(indistinct conversations)

41:41.160 --> 41:43.151
MAN: I see you!

41:43.200 --> 41:45.691
(laughter)

41:48.900 --> 41:51.562
WOMAN: Ooh, little bird.

41:51.610 --> 41:53.237
Ooh-ooh.

41:53.270 --> 41:55.204
(man laughs)

42:01.880 --> 42:03.575
You don't seem
as enthused about

42:03.620 --> 42:05.588
Reverend Mather's good news
as all the others.

42:05.620 --> 42:09.010
IfI hear one more round
of toasts to the Reverend

42:09.060 --> 42:11.517
or good, little Sibley
or blessed Baron Marburg,

42:11.560 --> 42:13.926
I might start
tearing up the place.

42:16.930 --> 42:18.659
You ever think
you knew a man

42:18.700 --> 42:22.090
and come to find out you
didn't know what he was at all?

42:22.140 --> 42:24.734
You know
Cotton Mather personally?

42:26.740 --> 42:31.575
I thought I did,
but maybe not.

42:31.610 --> 42:36.547
Or maybe you can't ever
really know a man

42:36.580 --> 42:41.711
or what he -- or you --
do when put to the test.

42:41.760 --> 42:43.910
(scoffs)

42:50.960 --> 42:53.394
(indistinct conversations,
laughter)

42:53.430 --> 42:56.558
**

43:36.140 --> 43:38.574
You did it,
my love.

43:38.610 --> 43:40.168
You did it!

43:40.210 --> 43:42.144
I didn't know
what you were gonna say.

43:42.180 --> 43:44.319
I thought I'd have to
watch you die right there.

43:44.350 --> 43:48.582
(scoffs) There was a moment
when I knew the Devil had won --

43:48.620 --> 43:53.455
that I had fallen out
of God's world into his.

43:53.490 --> 43:58.860
And then I saw you --
your face

43:58.900 --> 44:02.859
and the love --
light shining from it.

44:02.900 --> 44:05.368
I knew in an instant
that even if I was

44:05.410 --> 44:10.632
in a dark and godless universe,
there was still love.

44:10.680 --> 44:13.672
There was still you.

44:27.230 --> 44:31.769
**

44:34.070 --> 44:35.469
(chuckles)

44:35.500 --> 44:38.435
(both breathing heavily)

44:45.010 --> 44:47.240
(both moaning)

44:55.060 --> 44:58.518
**

45:21.980 --> 45:24.278
(cat meowing)

45:50.280 --> 45:52.373
Well?

45:52.410 --> 45:55.117
(sighs)
To my infinite surprise,

45:55.150 --> 45:58.574
her loyalty seems
perfectly genuine.

45:58.620 --> 46:01.180
(chuckles)

46:05.160 --> 46:07.685
You have made me
very happy, Mother.

46:16.640 --> 46:20.360
You have no idea how much
I've missed you, Mother.

46:22.510 --> 46:25.001
And I've so missed
my beautiful boy.

46:28.610 --> 46:31.170
Only you are not him.

46:32.220 --> 46:34.040
(splashing, bubbling)

46:37.020 --> 46:39.181
Mother, please!

46:43.560 --> 46:47.360
**

46:52.170 --> 46:55.207
Mother,
how could you?

47:19.270 --> 47:22.535
Such a disappointment.

47:22.570 --> 47:24.538
You failed my final test.

47:26.670 --> 47:29.707
Now mayI kill her?

47:29.740 --> 47:34.370
**

47:39.620 --> 47:42.783
**
