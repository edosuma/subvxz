00:18.619 --> 00:20.019
<i>Previously on</i> The Grinder...
I know what this is all about.

00:20.021 --> 00:21.820
I've overstayed my welcome.

00:21.822 --> 00:23.022
<i>Stewart's asked me to move out.</i>

00:23.024 --> 00:24.890
<i>It's a complete 180 at Dad's.</i>

00:24.892 --> 00:27.126
No one's being
a raging butthole.

00:27.128 --> 00:28.694
If you ever want
to come by our office

00:28.696 --> 00:30.629
and talk...
LANDY: We love to listen.

00:30.631 --> 00:33.032
They want me to practice law
for their firm

00:33.034 --> 00:34.900
with full in-court
speaking privileges.

00:34.902 --> 00:35.968
You want to work
for Rozz and Landy,

00:35.970 --> 00:37.136
then work for Rozz and Landy.

00:37.138 --> 00:38.504
I'll see you around, brother.

00:38.506 --> 00:40.946
Okay, Dean.
'Cause I no longer live here.

00:42.176 --> 00:45.044
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Previously on</i> The Grinder...

00:45.046 --> 00:46.478
How did you find me?

00:46.480 --> 00:48.547
How long are we gonna
keep up this charade?

00:48.549 --> 00:50.215
I'm never going back.

00:50.217 --> 00:53.485
I suggest your reel in those
fishing lines, Counselor.

00:53.487 --> 00:54.753
(gun cocks)

00:56.924 --> 00:59.491
You pull a gun on me,
you better be ready to use it.

00:59.493 --> 01:00.926
GORDON:
It didn't have to be like this.

01:00.928 --> 01:02.061
Who are you kidding?!

01:02.063 --> 01:03.662
You wanted me out of that firm!

01:03.664 --> 01:04.930
You forced me out!

01:04.932 --> 01:06.932
So you can turn around
and walk down that beach

01:06.934 --> 01:08.200
or you can pull that trigger,

01:08.202 --> 01:12.271
'cause either way,
I'm gonna be fine!

01:12.273 --> 01:14.273
GORDON: We were a team.

01:14.275 --> 01:17.342
Mitch, you and me...
(Dean sighs heavily)

01:17.344 --> 01:20.112
Stutz and Grinder.

01:20.114 --> 01:21.147
There was nothing
we couldn't do together

01:21.148 --> 01:22.181
and now you're willing
to throw it all away.

01:22.183 --> 01:24.516
Over what? A merger and some

01:24.518 --> 01:26.585
lousy piece of tail!

01:26.587 --> 01:28.287
(children shouting)

01:28.289 --> 01:30.689
CHILDREN: Grinder! Grinder!

01:30.691 --> 01:32.991
No, that's stupid.

01:34.261 --> 01:36.221
(Grinder talking indistinctly
on TV)

01:37.598 --> 01:39.198
GRINDER: Go ahead.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.365
You can shoot me.

01:40.367 --> 01:41.600
Are you man enough to murder

01:41.602 --> 01:43.035
all these beautiful peasants?

01:44.205 --> 01:46.138
I didn't think so.

01:46.140 --> 01:48.207
¶ ¶

01:50.811 --> 01:52.244
Morning, everyone. Good morning.

01:52.246 --> 01:54.146
Should be a pretty
easy week, I think.

01:54.148 --> 01:56.381
Let's see, we just have the, um,
the Pascal divorce case.

01:56.383 --> 01:59.051
You mean the case you're arguing
against your own brother?

01:59.053 --> 02:01.553
Dad, I'd hardly say
I'm arguing against Dean.

02:01.555 --> 02:03.122
Yeah, he's still not a lawyer.

02:03.124 --> 02:04.623
He just went to not work
at another firm.

02:04.625 --> 02:07.392
This whole thing makes me sick.
DEAN SR.: Me, too, Todd.

02:07.394 --> 02:08.627
I'm starting to question
what we're even doing here.

02:08.629 --> 02:10.262
Well, Dad, what we're doing is

02:10.264 --> 02:12.231
pretty much what we did
before Dean got here.

02:12.233 --> 02:14.233
I mean, we were functioning
pretty well, remember?

02:14.235 --> 02:15.334
I do not.

02:15.336 --> 02:16.235
He made us better.

02:16.237 --> 02:17.736
Well, Todd, we will

02:17.738 --> 02:19.938
continue on, uh,
being better, then.

02:19.940 --> 02:21.240
To-to make,

02:21.242 --> 02:23.509
to make him proud, right?

02:25.412 --> 02:28.080
Uh, because, uh...

02:28.082 --> 02:29.648
because justice is

02:29.650 --> 02:31.850
a fragile lady,

02:31.852 --> 02:34.786
who needs protection by us
under law.

02:34.788 --> 02:38.590
And as guardians of justice...

02:38.592 --> 02:39.858
Stewart, people are leaving.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.260
I see it, I see it.

02:41.262 --> 02:42.895
Nice try, son.

02:43.864 --> 02:45.864
Mr. Pascal's prenup.

02:45.866 --> 02:48.634
It's ironclad.
We need to find away around it.

02:48.636 --> 02:49.868
DEAN: Or...

02:49.870 --> 02:52.104
do we just plow
right through it?

02:52.106 --> 02:55.674
Wow, the timing
of that was impeccable.

02:55.676 --> 02:56.875
Did you see that, Pat?

02:56.877 --> 02:58.277
Oh, I saw it. He came in with

02:58.279 --> 02:59.811
the exact opposite
of what you were saying...

02:59.813 --> 03:01.547
At the perfect moment.

03:01.549 --> 03:03.615
Aw, guys, it's just training
and some instinct.

03:03.617 --> 03:06.451
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am truly honored

03:06.453 --> 03:08.020
to officially welcome
the newest member of our team.

03:08.022 --> 03:10.489
LANDY: You know him
as TV's The Grinder.

03:10.491 --> 03:12.224
Please give
a warm Rozz/Landy welcome

03:12.226 --> 03:14.126
to the incomparable
Dean Sanderson.

03:14.128 --> 03:15.327
(excited murmuring)

03:15.329 --> 03:16.828
Oh, please, please.

03:16.830 --> 03:20.499
Um, first let me say,
uh, how excited I am

03:20.501 --> 03:22.000
to be joining this team.

03:22.002 --> 03:23.702
I look forward
to not only learning

03:23.704 --> 03:26.038
which one of you is Rozz
and which one of you is Landy,

03:26.040 --> 03:28.140
but to developing
a close, personal

03:28.142 --> 03:30.475
workplace dynamic
with each and every one of you.

03:30.477 --> 03:32.311
Honestly, we didn't bring
you here to learn our names.

03:32.313 --> 03:34.146
We know 'em.

03:34.148 --> 03:36.582
But what we don't know
is how to grind.

03:36.584 --> 03:38.350
Then you came
to the right place.

03:38.352 --> 03:39.651
All right, what do we got?

03:39.653 --> 03:41.153
Hugh?

03:41.155 --> 03:42.321
What if we told you

03:42.323 --> 03:44.323
we found a way to let you, sir,

03:44.325 --> 03:46.091
speak in court?

03:46.093 --> 03:47.659
Well, then I would ask you,
sir, how?

03:47.661 --> 03:49.928
What if we told you
not to worry about how,

03:49.930 --> 03:51.830
we've got it covered?
Well, then I would say

03:51.832 --> 03:53.432
I am worried
and would like to know.

03:53.434 --> 03:57.169
Then we would tell you
that we found the loophole.

03:57.171 --> 03:58.070
Boom.

03:58.072 --> 03:59.538
Then I would end
the conversation

03:59.540 --> 04:03.375
by saying,
"Get that courtroom ready,

04:03.377 --> 04:06.245
because I've got
some speaking to do."

04:07.615 --> 04:08.880
It's like I'm watching the show.

04:08.882 --> 04:10.382
Oh, just goose bumps.

04:10.384 --> 04:12.618
Wow. (Laughs)

04:12.620 --> 04:14.686
(sighs)

04:16.423 --> 04:17.422
Hey, Todd.

04:17.424 --> 04:18.957
Hey.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.559
You okay?

04:20.561 --> 04:21.893
I'm just sad.

04:21.895 --> 04:22.894
Yeah, I know.

04:22.896 --> 04:24.529
About Dean.

04:24.531 --> 04:25.297
I got that.

04:25.299 --> 04:27.566
Leaving. Yep.

04:27.568 --> 04:29.534
Look, it's all gonna
work out, okay?

04:29.536 --> 04:32.371
You'll be fine. Thanks, Claire.

04:32.373 --> 04:35.073
Y-You know what's kind of
weird to think about, I guess

04:35.075 --> 04:37.576
now that the big man's gone,
I guess we're the new office

04:37.578 --> 04:40.479
"will they/won't they," hmm?
The what?

04:40.481 --> 04:41.980
You know, that thing
you had with Dean?

04:41.982 --> 04:43.448
Um, I never had
a thing with Dean,

04:43.450 --> 04:45.384
and also I will never
have a thing with you.

04:45.386 --> 04:48.487
Wow, it's already exactly
like you and Dean.

04:48.489 --> 04:50.422
(groans)
Why does this keep happening?

04:50.424 --> 04:52.991
Is it because
I'm the only single woman here?

04:52.993 --> 04:55.794
So, we're starting
with the "won't they."

04:55.796 --> 04:58.230
That makes sense.

04:58.232 --> 04:59.898
ETHAN: <i>Lizzie, I don't want
to hear this stuff!</i>

04:59.900 --> 05:00.999
(glass breaks)

05:01.001 --> 05:02.734
DEBBIE: You guys, what is...?

05:02.736 --> 05:04.002
Wh...? Ethan!

05:04.004 --> 05:06.004
Uh, I-I'll pay for that.

05:06.006 --> 05:07.506
What happened?

05:07.508 --> 05:08.740
I don't want
to get back into it.

05:08.742 --> 05:09.741
It'll just make me more angry.

05:09.743 --> 05:10.742
Try.

05:10.744 --> 05:12.511
I walked in the door,

05:12.513 --> 05:14.446
and then she starts blabbing
her dumb poems at me...

05:14.448 --> 05:16.014
They're not poems,
they're musings.

05:16.016 --> 05:17.015
They're garbage!

05:17.017 --> 05:18.450
Whoa. Ethan.

05:18.452 --> 05:19.818
Are you feeling okay, buddy?

05:19.820 --> 05:21.453
To be honest, no.

05:21.455 --> 05:22.187
I'm a little off.

05:22.189 --> 05:23.322
Uncle Dean used to lead me

05:23.324 --> 05:24.756
through meditation every morning

05:24.758 --> 05:26.458
to help with my rage.

05:26.460 --> 05:27.693
"Meditation"? "Rage"?

05:27.695 --> 05:30.262
I might just go upstairs
and decompress.

05:30.264 --> 05:31.763
I'll be down in a bit.

05:31.765 --> 05:32.931
DEBBIE: You go decompress.

05:32.933 --> 05:34.266
STEWART:
What is he enraged about?

05:34.268 --> 05:35.967
Honey, what are these musings?

05:35.969 --> 05:38.036
Uncle Dean
was really encouraging me

05:38.038 --> 05:40.472
to explore my thoughts
and express them

05:40.474 --> 05:42.207
through prose in my journal.

05:42.209 --> 05:44.276
I didn't even know
you were doing that.

05:44.278 --> 05:45.844
Yeah, it sounds
like a-a great thing,

05:45.846 --> 05:47.446
to-to explore your thoughts...

05:47.448 --> 05:48.980
Through prose.

05:48.982 --> 05:50.282
Then we talked them through,

05:50.284 --> 05:52.351
and I guess it just
made me feel less alone.

05:52.353 --> 05:53.452
Oh.

05:53.454 --> 05:54.553
Okay, well I could

05:54.555 --> 05:56.621
do that with you, right?

05:56.623 --> 05:57.522
That sounds fun.
No, it's not fun.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.424
It's actually really serious.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.994
Did you know Dean
was doing all that?

06:02.996 --> 06:04.496
No.

06:04.498 --> 06:06.164
I didn't.

06:06.166 --> 06:07.999
It's kind of sweet.

06:08.001 --> 06:10.502
I mean, it seems like
they really connected with him.

06:10.504 --> 06:12.003
You know, this isn't
my fault, honey.

06:12.005 --> 06:14.005
I just asked him
what his plan was.

06:14.007 --> 06:16.007
He was the one that blew up
and cut off all contact.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.509
I am not saying it's your fault.

06:17.511 --> 06:18.744
I just think
the kids really miss him.

06:18.746 --> 06:20.379
Yeah, I know.

06:22.416 --> 06:23.982
Wait a second.

06:23.984 --> 06:25.584
Do you miss him? What?

06:25.586 --> 06:27.319
You miss Dean living here?

06:27.321 --> 06:29.020
No! You do!

06:29.022 --> 06:30.589
Honey, that's a
crazy thing to say.

06:30.591 --> 06:32.324
You... No. No!

06:32.326 --> 06:34.326
I think you need
to explore your thoughts

06:34.328 --> 06:35.894
in a journal, through prose.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.896
I'm... I think
I'm good on my thoughts.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.332
We're good, me and my thoughts.

06:43.237 --> 06:45.003
Oh, excuse me.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.705
Stew. Dean.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.240
Hi. Hi.

06:48.242 --> 06:49.908
You look good.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.209
Thank you.

06:51.211 --> 06:52.677
Uh, so do you.

06:52.679 --> 06:53.578
Thank you.

06:53.580 --> 06:54.713
New suit?

06:54.715 --> 06:56.248
It is. Hmm.

06:56.250 --> 06:58.083
Oh, forgot what
a good eye you have.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.551
Thank you for noticing.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.586
Uh, how's Andre?

07:01.588 --> 07:03.121
Andre's a survivor, Stew.

07:03.123 --> 07:05.123
I don't know where he is.

07:05.125 --> 07:07.259
And I don't know
how he got there.

07:07.261 --> 07:08.627
But I think wherever he is,

07:08.629 --> 07:10.862
he's smiling.

07:10.864 --> 07:12.864
Okay, well,

07:12.866 --> 07:14.433
long as he's situated.

07:14.435 --> 07:16.468
Okay,<i> Pascal v. Pascal.</i>

07:16.470 --> 07:19.137
I understand the plaintiff
has a mediation list?

07:19.139 --> 07:22.140
Yes, Your Honor, our client,
Ms. Georgia Pascal...

07:22.142 --> 07:23.742
Um... I'm sorry.

07:23.744 --> 07:24.743
Objection.

07:24.745 --> 07:26.378
Yes, Mr. Sanderson?

07:26.380 --> 07:30.449
Your Honor, and I...
I hate to do this, but, uh...

07:30.451 --> 07:34.453
opposing counsel... my brother...
Is not a lawyer.

07:34.455 --> 07:35.620
So, technically,

07:35.622 --> 07:37.722
he can't speak in court.

07:37.724 --> 07:39.658
Your Honor, if I may overrule

07:39.660 --> 07:42.093
my brother's objection...
You may not.

07:42.095 --> 07:43.628
Let me rephrase that.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.297
While it is true

07:45.299 --> 07:47.766
I am not a lawyer,
as my opponent

07:47.768 --> 07:49.568
has taken great pains
to point out today

07:49.570 --> 07:52.070
and many other hurtful times
over the past four months,

07:52.072 --> 07:53.572
he's wrong on one point.

07:53.574 --> 07:54.973
I can speak in court.

07:54.975 --> 07:55.974
What? Huh?

07:55.976 --> 07:56.975
My new employers,

07:56.977 --> 07:58.477
Hugh Rozz and Pat Landy...

07:58.479 --> 07:59.578
Uh, I'm actually, uh...

07:59.580 --> 08:01.913
took the time
to get me certified,

08:01.915 --> 08:04.749
as a certified legal intern.

08:04.751 --> 08:05.984
Which means

08:05.986 --> 08:07.319
I can speak in court

08:07.321 --> 08:09.241
as long as one of them
is present.

08:09.857 --> 08:11.690
And it doesn't matter which one.

08:11.692 --> 08:13.091
Aw, crap.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.593
That is actually a thing.

08:14.595 --> 08:16.715
(whispering): You thought
this day would never come...

08:17.431 --> 08:19.431
but you...

08:19.433 --> 08:20.999
thought...

08:21.001 --> 08:22.300
wrong.

08:22.302 --> 08:23.869
What did he say?

08:23.871 --> 08:25.637
I-I couldn't hear a word.

08:25.639 --> 08:27.759
I thought you might know.
No. I didn't.

08:32.212 --> 08:34.112
I don't like it. Not one bit.

08:34.114 --> 08:35.647
Go and apologize to him.

08:35.649 --> 08:37.215
Get him back here with us.

08:37.217 --> 08:39.117
Dad, he's the one that blew
this out of proportion.

08:39.119 --> 08:40.218
I mean, he left the firm,

08:40.220 --> 08:41.786
he went to go work
for our competitors,

08:41.788 --> 08:43.655
who, by the way, if you ask me,

08:43.657 --> 08:44.890
might have some
questionable motives.

08:44.892 --> 08:46.558
Now I know where
Ethan got his rage.

08:46.560 --> 08:47.626
CLAIRE: Wait, are you suggesting

08:47.628 --> 08:49.160
that they don't want him

08:49.162 --> 08:50.662
simply because
he's a great attorney?

08:50.664 --> 08:52.664
Stew, just settle out of court.

08:52.666 --> 08:55.534
I can't bear to see my sons
tear each other apart in public.

08:55.536 --> 08:57.903
Just do it for me, your dad.

08:57.905 --> 09:00.138
Fine, Dad,
I will talk to the client

09:00.140 --> 09:01.740
and see if they want to settle.

09:01.742 --> 09:02.574
Good.

09:02.576 --> 09:03.642
But I'm not apologizing.

09:03.644 --> 09:05.043
Good.

09:08.849 --> 09:11.850
Oh, man, I hope nobody
gets the wrong idea.

09:11.852 --> 09:13.752
About what?

09:13.754 --> 09:15.053
You and me...

09:15.055 --> 09:16.588
hangin' back...

09:16.590 --> 09:18.390
(whispers):
Whispering like this.

09:18.392 --> 09:19.858
Oh.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.226
You're still... Okay.

09:22.696 --> 09:25.664
All right, let's have sex. What?

09:25.666 --> 09:27.499
Yeah, why don't you go
into the men's room

09:27.501 --> 09:29.267
and then I'll wait 30 seconds
and follow you in?

09:29.269 --> 09:31.703
Uh, okay, I mean,
we could do that,

09:31.705 --> 09:33.672
but I'm...
like, is now the best time?

09:33.674 --> 09:36.074
You know, because we're, uh,
we're just so swamped

09:36.076 --> 09:37.676
with the divorce case

09:37.678 --> 09:39.210
and all that at the... Right.

09:39.212 --> 09:40.512
Right, that's a good point.

09:40.514 --> 09:41.880
Why don't we do it

09:41.882 --> 09:42.881
right after the trial ends...
Okay.

09:42.883 --> 09:45.717
In this room,
right here on this table.

09:45.719 --> 09:46.785
And you know what?
You better not

09:46.787 --> 09:48.520
be a jerk and be
all quiet during it.

09:48.522 --> 09:50.522
No. I won't.

09:50.524 --> 09:52.090
Can I leave? Yeah.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.725
Okay. I'll-I'll go prepare.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.427
I'll go prepare.

09:55.429 --> 09:57.228
LANDY:
<i>She's pushing for the house.</i>

09:57.230 --> 09:58.863
Well, her husband built it
before their marriage,

09:58.865 --> 10:00.732
so I don't think we can get it.
I definitely think

10:00.734 --> 10:02.300
we can get Mrs. Pascal at
least 30 grand in alimony.

10:02.302 --> 10:03.301
Pascalimony.

10:03.303 --> 10:04.803
You cooking something, Dean?

10:04.805 --> 10:06.104
I don't know yet.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.405
Hey, somebody want to...

10:07.407 --> 10:08.740
I got it. I'm getting it.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.809
Guys, you know what?
This is nice.

10:10.811 --> 10:13.111
Usually, there's nobody around
to write this stuff down.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.713
Think.

10:14.715 --> 10:16.815
How many great ideas...
Down the toilet.

10:16.817 --> 10:18.617
I just had a thought.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.418
Deano, you want to break off
a small room on it?

10:20.420 --> 10:21.319
On Pascalimony?

10:21.321 --> 10:22.454
See where it goes?

10:22.456 --> 10:23.755
We'll keep cranking on this.

10:23.757 --> 10:25.123
You sure?
You guys okay with that?

10:25.125 --> 10:26.758
Yeah, okay? I'm just bummed
I'm not gonna be there

10:26.760 --> 10:28.259
to see the process.

10:28.261 --> 10:30.128
Watch you take this thing
further down the field.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.731
Yeah, how many soldiers you need?
I'm thinking maybe a couple.

10:32.733 --> 10:33.832
You know, how 'bout you guys?
WOMAN: Sure.

10:33.834 --> 10:34.933
MAN: Count me in. Lock and load.

10:34.935 --> 10:36.835
Let's do this.

10:36.837 --> 10:38.436
STEWART:
<i>The client wants to settle.</i>

10:38.438 --> 10:39.738
He doesn't even care
about the alimony.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.773
Ooh. I want to divorce that guy.

10:41.775 --> 10:43.775
Wait. So if he wants to settle,

10:43.777 --> 10:44.843
I mean, what's the problem?

10:44.845 --> 10:46.778
The problem is, now I
have to go to Dean,

10:46.780 --> 10:48.346
who's gonna try and
get me to apologize.

10:48.348 --> 10:50.148
Which, by the way,
is what my dad wants,

10:50.150 --> 10:51.449
even though I did nothing wrong.

10:51.451 --> 10:52.951
Nothing. I did nothing wrong.

10:52.953 --> 10:55.920
Not a thing. Are you mocking
me or being serious?

10:55.922 --> 10:57.088
'Cause you're playing it
right on the line.

10:57.090 --> 10:58.857
Look, obviously,
your brother just wants

10:58.859 --> 11:00.825
to be treated like a lawyer, so
maybe this is your opportunity

11:00.827 --> 11:02.160
to give him what he wants.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.462
And maybe you guys
can start talking again

11:04.464 --> 11:07.599
and maybe he can...
help us with the kids again.

11:07.601 --> 11:08.700
Lizzie's dream journal's
that bad?

11:08.702 --> 11:10.268
Oh, my God.

11:10.270 --> 11:11.836
Look, it's-it's either, like,
she is a genius

11:11.838 --> 11:15.173
and it's all way over my head
or she is a deranged sociopath

11:15.175 --> 11:17.042
who needs to be
institutionalized.

11:17.044 --> 11:18.877
Well, it's definitely
one of those two. Yeah.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.879
It can't be anything else.
No. I've narrowed it down.

11:20.881 --> 11:21.880
We should try
to get Dean over here,

11:21.882 --> 11:23.114
help us figure it out, I guess.

11:23.116 --> 11:25.550
I mean, I'll take any help
I can get.

11:30.891 --> 11:32.724
Uh, Counselor? A moment?

11:32.726 --> 11:34.859
(clears throat) Stewart.

11:34.861 --> 11:37.762
Reception alerted me
to your presence.

11:38.999 --> 11:40.832
Is this the office
from<i> The Grinder?</i>

11:40.834 --> 11:42.133
It is.

11:42.135 --> 11:44.202
Rozz/Landy built me a replica.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.804
They wanted me to feel at home.

11:45.806 --> 11:47.972
Which is all I've ever wanted.

11:47.974 --> 11:49.407
From the beginning.

11:49.409 --> 11:52.010
Um... well...

11:52.012 --> 11:53.645
it seems you're...

11:53.647 --> 11:56.147
you're very happy here.
I am happy.

11:56.149 --> 11:58.016
I'm happy to hear that.
And I'm happy to hear that.

11:58.018 --> 11:59.858
Good. It's great.

12:01.088 --> 12:03.154
So you said you had some
business you wanted to discuss.

12:03.156 --> 12:04.522
Uh, yes.

12:04.524 --> 12:06.524
I have a settlement
proposal here.

12:06.526 --> 12:07.926
I think you'll find it fair.

12:07.928 --> 12:09.227
Did Dad send you over...

12:09.229 --> 12:10.595
No. To discuss the settlement?

12:10.597 --> 12:12.664
Well, I mean, yes,
he weighed in on the settlement,

12:12.666 --> 12:14.666
but I'm here as a lawyer,

12:14.668 --> 12:17.202
to talk to you
as another member of the...

12:17.204 --> 12:19.170
the legal profession.

12:19.172 --> 12:20.238
I appreciate that.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.774
It just seems, Dean, uh,
that a settlement

12:22.776 --> 12:24.042
is really what's
in the best interests

12:24.044 --> 12:25.543
of both our clients.
(knocking on glass)

12:25.545 --> 12:26.878
Oh, Stew-bone!

12:26.880 --> 12:28.113
Always good to see you.

12:28.115 --> 12:29.447
Deano, are you in the
middle of something?

12:29.449 --> 12:31.449
Yeah. I sent up
the Pascalimony stuff.

12:31.451 --> 12:32.784
Still waiting for
some feedback on that.

12:32.786 --> 12:34.853
Gettin' that ready for you.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.354
And I'm just
finishing up the proposal

12:36.356 --> 12:37.889
on that class action lawsuit
that I pitched.

12:37.891 --> 12:39.057
The one against ISIS.

12:39.059 --> 12:40.692
Yep. Sounds strong.

12:40.694 --> 12:42.360
And now I'm just discussing
a settlement offer

12:42.362 --> 12:43.561
with opposing counsel.

12:43.563 --> 12:45.029
Settlement, great.

12:45.031 --> 12:47.132
Actually, we should probably
all convene for that discussion.

12:47.134 --> 12:48.967
Uh, and if you have a second,

12:48.969 --> 12:51.035
we have another client here who
would love to meet The Grinder.

12:51.037 --> 12:52.036
Yeah. You bet.

12:52.038 --> 12:53.371
Stew-beef.

12:53.373 --> 12:55.607
Do they do that a lot?

12:55.609 --> 12:56.875
Do what? Parade you around

12:56.877 --> 12:58.276
to meet new clients.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.611
Parade me around?
Like a show pony?

12:59.613 --> 13:00.712
No, that's-that's not
what I meant.

13:00.714 --> 13:01.913
What exactly did you mean?

13:01.915 --> 13:03.915
I just, I just feel like

13:03.917 --> 13:07.218
Rozz and Landy are using you
for your celebrity.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.287
Just so you can
entertain the clients.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.289
My God.

13:11.291 --> 13:14.959
My... God.

13:14.961 --> 13:17.295
You just can't be happy for me,
can you?

13:17.297 --> 13:18.997
You just can't stand

13:18.999 --> 13:21.933
to see me succeed
on my own terms,

13:21.935 --> 13:23.001
as a lawyer.

13:23.003 --> 13:24.269
Certified legal intern.

13:24.271 --> 13:26.671
Oh, well, God forbid
I use the wrong terminology,

13:26.673 --> 13:28.506
because Stew is the only lawyer
in this family.

13:28.508 --> 13:29.908
Dad's a lawyer.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.509
In fact, you're the only
not-lawyer in the family.

13:31.511 --> 13:33.912
You know what?

13:33.914 --> 13:35.446
You go back to our father

13:35.448 --> 13:38.516
and you tell him
that my counterproposal

13:38.518 --> 13:40.819
to your settlement offer
is this.

13:41.755 --> 13:43.822
I will see you in court.

13:49.429 --> 13:50.962
You couldn't have just settled?

13:50.964 --> 13:52.664
I tried, Dad. He tore it up.

13:52.666 --> 13:54.199
You ever heard of tape?

13:55.769 --> 13:57.335
You know, Claire, um...

13:57.337 --> 13:59.037
about this arrangement we have...

13:59.039 --> 14:00.471
Which I'm still,
I'm totally into, um...

14:00.473 --> 14:02.774
Oh, right, right.
Thank you for reminding me.

14:02.776 --> 14:05.043
Wh...?
Hey, Stewart, Mr. Sanderson,

14:05.045 --> 14:06.477
Todd and I are gonna be needing

14:06.479 --> 14:07.979
the conference room tonight
around 6:00 p.m.,

14:07.981 --> 14:09.981
and under no circumstances

14:09.983 --> 14:11.783
are we to be interrupted,
no matter what you hear.

14:11.785 --> 14:13.885
'Cause it might get loud

14:13.887 --> 14:16.154
and a little disturbing. What?

14:16.156 --> 14:17.989
Whatever you need. Sounds good.

14:17.991 --> 14:19.958
I'm just feeling a tickle
in the back of my throat.

14:19.960 --> 14:20.959
You're not sick, you're fine.

14:20.961 --> 14:22.861
I think I might be sick.

14:22.863 --> 14:25.797
Hey, FYI... Judge Adams
is a bit of a<i> Grinder</i> fan.

14:25.799 --> 14:28.366
Ooh, that's never
not nice to hear.

14:28.368 --> 14:31.035
So if you want to open
with a few "Grinder rests,"

14:31.037 --> 14:32.871
that'll go a long way.

14:32.873 --> 14:34.505
Well, I can't open
with "Grinder rests."

14:34.507 --> 14:36.374
What would I be resting?

14:36.376 --> 14:38.076
Yeah, Rozz,
what would he be resting?

14:38.078 --> 14:40.245
Dean and I don't even know
what you're talking about.

14:40.247 --> 14:42.080
ADAMS: Good morning, all.

14:42.082 --> 14:43.915
I'm told the two sides
couldn't come to a settlement,

14:43.917 --> 14:45.917
so we'll go ahead and start
with opening arguments.

14:45.919 --> 14:46.985
Mr. Sanderson, you're up.

14:46.987 --> 14:48.720
Thank you, Your Honor.

14:48.722 --> 14:51.389
Uh, our client,
Mr. Pascal, built his home

14:51.391 --> 14:52.824
prior to his marriage

14:52.826 --> 14:54.926
to Mrs. Pascal... Objection!

14:54.928 --> 14:56.694
Uh, you can't object.
This is opening arguments.

14:56.696 --> 14:57.996
He's right. Don't do that.

14:57.998 --> 14:59.898
Then not an objection,
a comment.

14:59.900 --> 15:01.199
My client poured countless hours

15:01.201 --> 15:03.735
into this property,
both in terms of remod...

15:03.737 --> 15:05.103
Objection. He's still objecting.

15:05.105 --> 15:06.938
Objection. I made it very clear
that I was not objecting,

15:06.940 --> 15:08.106
merely commenting for my client,

15:08.108 --> 15:10.108
who spent countless hours
pouring her heart...

15:10.110 --> 15:12.410
Your Honor, he's still doing it.
ADAMS: Yes, I'm aware.

15:12.412 --> 15:13.945
Mr. Sanderson,
you need to stop talking.

15:13.947 --> 15:15.280
You need to stop talking!

15:15.282 --> 15:16.414
And you need to stop
baiting your brother.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.283
I wasn't. I-I was just...

15:18.285 --> 15:19.517
Your Honor, neither objecting
nor commenting,

15:19.519 --> 15:20.852
you are absolutely right.

15:20.854 --> 15:21.853
He was clearly baiting me.

15:21.855 --> 15:23.054
I was not baiting you, Dean.

15:23.056 --> 15:24.188
I was just trying to...
(gavel banging)

15:24.190 --> 15:25.356
Okay.

15:25.358 --> 15:27.125
I know this isn't a legal term,

15:27.127 --> 15:28.559
but I'm calling a do-over.

15:28.561 --> 15:31.062
We'll take a short recess,
and I'd like you both to be

15:31.064 --> 15:33.064
better at this
when we come back.

15:33.066 --> 15:34.032
ROZZ: You were winning.

15:34.034 --> 15:35.033
Everyone in that courtroom
knows it.

15:35.035 --> 15:36.434
This is not on you.

15:36.436 --> 15:37.535
It's just luck of the judge.

15:37.537 --> 15:38.636
We thought he was a fan.

15:38.638 --> 15:40.038
Obviously we misread that.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.440
No, guys, I got to own this one.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.775
It's my bad.

15:43.777 --> 15:45.209
I came in a little hot,
but I got this.

15:45.211 --> 15:46.778
I was up all night
studying property law.

15:46.780 --> 15:48.947
Now I'm wondering... and this is
'cause of the judge thing...

15:48.949 --> 15:51.649
Should Pat and I maybe
take the lead when we get back?

15:51.651 --> 15:53.384
And Dean could what?

15:53.386 --> 15:55.253
Maybe comfort Ms. Pascal.

15:55.255 --> 15:57.255
Oh, yeah. We do like to go

15:57.257 --> 15:59.557
above and beyond
for our clients.

15:59.559 --> 16:02.260
So you guys continue the case
and I comfort Ms. Pascal?

16:02.262 --> 16:05.096
Ah, great idea, Dean.

16:05.098 --> 16:06.264
Yes, she is hurting.

16:06.266 --> 16:07.465
So... what?

16:07.467 --> 16:08.967
I would take her to dinner.

16:08.969 --> 16:10.068
Is that what you're thinking?

16:10.070 --> 16:11.569
Is it dinner? Is it drinks?

16:11.571 --> 16:12.770
Or do we forget dinner?

16:12.772 --> 16:14.339
Is dinner not even a part of it?

16:14.341 --> 16:15.473
That's your call.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.675
But then I'm back in court?

16:17.677 --> 16:19.844
Depends on how late dinner goes,
if you know what I'm saying.

16:19.846 --> 16:21.179
Huh? Huh?

16:21.181 --> 16:22.981
Yeah, no, I-I know
what you're saying.

16:22.983 --> 16:24.682
You want me
to entertain the client.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.684
Yes! Sick.

16:26.686 --> 16:28.519
See you in a bit.

16:30.090 --> 16:32.857
How could I have been so blind?

16:32.859 --> 16:33.858
Thank you, Mr. Pascal.

16:33.860 --> 16:36.294
Your Honor,
no further questions.

16:36.296 --> 16:39.297
Uh, Your Honor?
Further questions!

16:39.299 --> 16:40.798
This will be good.

16:40.800 --> 16:41.799
I can take it from here, Rozz.

16:41.801 --> 16:44.268
He got my name right.

16:44.270 --> 16:46.137
Mr. Pascal, how long were
you and your wife married?

16:46.139 --> 16:47.705
Eight years. Wow.

16:47.707 --> 16:49.307
That's a long time.

16:49.309 --> 16:51.943
Relationships are tricky.

16:51.945 --> 16:54.145
They're filled with good moments

16:54.147 --> 16:57.215
and... some not so good moments.

16:57.217 --> 17:00.151
Maybe sometimes
you both say things

17:00.153 --> 17:02.620
that we regret,
and then pride gets in the way

17:02.622 --> 17:05.023
and you can't take it back.

17:05.025 --> 17:07.392
Perhaps your wife
should've been more grateful.

17:07.394 --> 17:09.727
Isn't he on our side? Shh.

17:09.729 --> 17:12.330
And when you decided to
part ways, it was only because

17:12.332 --> 17:14.532
you were doing what you thought
was best for both of you.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.734
It was mainly
because she had a boyfriend.

17:16.736 --> 17:19.296
You see what your brother's
doing, don't you?

17:20.540 --> 17:23.141
Objection, Your Honor.

17:23.143 --> 17:24.742
I'm sure that Mrs. Pascal

17:24.744 --> 17:26.177
contributed a lot
to the household.

17:26.179 --> 17:27.545
And my client

17:27.547 --> 17:29.213
would just

17:29.215 --> 17:30.748
like it stated for the record

17:30.750 --> 17:32.750
that without her contributions,

17:32.752 --> 17:35.853
it would've not felt like a...

17:35.855 --> 17:37.488
like a home.

17:37.490 --> 17:38.689
I actually don't

17:38.691 --> 17:39.724
want that on the record.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.159
I do not feel that way.

17:41.161 --> 17:44.195
Objection, Your Honor.
My client would also like

17:44.197 --> 17:46.697
something on the record
and that is that

17:46.699 --> 17:49.367
she appreciates that. Huh?

17:49.369 --> 17:51.169
You've lost. STEWART:
That's not an objection.

17:51.171 --> 17:52.170
That's a comment.

17:52.172 --> 17:53.504
And I'll allow it.

17:53.506 --> 17:55.173
This is not what I want at all!

17:55.175 --> 17:57.735
This isn't about what you want.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.078
Your Honor? (Shushes)

18:00.080 --> 18:01.646
This is nice.

18:03.116 --> 18:04.782
I think they were talking
about their own personal stuff.

18:04.784 --> 18:05.850
Yeah, Todd.

18:11.191 --> 18:12.223
I am so proud of you guys.

18:12.225 --> 18:14.225
Even though we both got fired

18:14.227 --> 18:15.393
by our clients mid-trial?

18:15.395 --> 18:17.128
I don't think anybody was paying

18:17.130 --> 18:18.396
any attention to that. Oh.

18:18.398 --> 18:19.797
Fellas?

18:19.799 --> 18:21.299
I'm afraid I have to decline

18:21.301 --> 18:22.400
your offer to work
at Rozz/Landy.

18:22.402 --> 18:24.302
I'm with Sanderson & Yao.

18:24.304 --> 18:25.703
Damn right you are!

18:25.705 --> 18:27.238
Decline the offer?

18:27.240 --> 18:28.206
You've already
been working for us.

18:28.208 --> 18:30.308
You never cared about

18:30.310 --> 18:33.244
that little room we broke off
for Pascalimony, did you?

18:33.246 --> 18:35.146
No, we didn't.

18:35.148 --> 18:36.214
Well, now you'll never know.

18:36.216 --> 18:37.815
It was a lot of good stuff.

18:37.817 --> 18:40.384
Oh, geez.

18:40.386 --> 18:41.319
Oh, no, Claire.

18:41.321 --> 18:42.620
You know what I just realized?

18:42.622 --> 18:44.255
Now that Dean's back,

18:44.257 --> 18:45.957
you and me can't happen.

18:45.959 --> 18:48.059
What? No.

18:48.061 --> 18:49.760
Yeah, I was so damn psyched

18:49.762 --> 18:51.929
to achieve and maintain
an erection with you.

18:51.931 --> 18:53.431
(sighs dramatically)

18:53.433 --> 18:56.134
I mean, I was really, really
looking forward to it,

18:56.136 --> 18:58.269
but... if you're sure.

18:58.271 --> 19:00.171
I'm sure, so... sorry.

19:00.173 --> 19:01.372
Sorry.

19:03.409 --> 19:06.210
(whispers):
Please don't ever leave again.

19:07.247 --> 19:09.647
"I'm not here.

19:09.649 --> 19:13.351
"I'm not here. I'm not here.

19:13.353 --> 19:16.187
"I'm... not here.

19:16.189 --> 19:17.455
"I'm not here. (Mouthing)

19:17.457 --> 19:19.423
"I'm here

19:19.425 --> 19:20.424
"barely." (mouthing)

19:20.426 --> 19:22.460
It's really good.

19:22.462 --> 19:24.428
And I totally get
where you're getting from.

19:24.430 --> 19:25.296
He does?

19:25.298 --> 19:26.364
I knew you would.

19:26.366 --> 19:28.099
I really poured myself into it,
blindly.

19:28.101 --> 19:29.600
And that reads. It does?

19:29.602 --> 19:31.435
E, how long
did you meditate today?

19:31.437 --> 19:33.204
I only got 15 minutes in.

19:33.206 --> 19:34.272
Bro, you got to push yourself.

19:34.274 --> 19:35.873
You feel that Hulk anger
coming up,

19:35.875 --> 19:37.308
you got to use your breath.

19:37.310 --> 19:39.310
I needed this. Dad?

19:39.312 --> 19:41.012
Do you feel
what's happening here?

19:41.014 --> 19:43.681
Uh, yeah, I, uh, I feel it.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.483
We're really glad
you're back, Dean.

19:45.485 --> 19:47.618
And do you feel exactly
the same way, Stew?

19:49.122 --> 19:50.288
Yeah.

19:50.290 --> 19:51.556
I do.

19:51.558 --> 19:53.124
Me, too.

19:53.126 --> 19:55.560
Oh! I've got
a surprise for everyone.

19:55.562 --> 19:58.196
Put on one of these
blindfolds and meet me

19:58.198 --> 20:00.698
in the backyard
in three minutes.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.567
Uh, do we have to put these on?

20:02.569 --> 20:06.237
They won't work otherwise.

20:06.239 --> 20:08.406
God, I've missed this.

20:08.408 --> 20:10.508
Okay. Okay.

20:10.510 --> 20:13.344
I overreacted when you asked me
about my future plans

20:13.346 --> 20:15.346
because I didn't have any.

20:15.348 --> 20:16.914
I do now.

20:16.916 --> 20:19.250
Take off your blindfolds!

20:21.721 --> 20:24.355
Huh? What happened?!

20:24.357 --> 20:26.357
I bought the house behind you.
Houses.

20:26.359 --> 20:28.593
I'm sorry...
Then, where are they?

20:28.595 --> 20:30.494
I knocked them down.
They were all wrong.

20:30.496 --> 20:32.496
Then, where are the Lublands?

20:32.498 --> 20:34.365
I relocated them.

20:34.367 --> 20:35.733
And I think they're
gonna be happier for it.

20:35.735 --> 20:39.070
I'm gonna build my dream house
so I can be closer to my family.

20:39.072 --> 20:40.438
How long is that gonna take?

20:40.440 --> 20:42.173
Eh, I don't know.
Couple of months, a few years.

20:42.175 --> 20:44.675
That sounds vague. It's general.

20:44.677 --> 20:45.743
I feel like they could
narrow that window.

20:45.745 --> 20:48.412
But in the meantime...

20:48.414 --> 20:51.349
Yes, uh, in...

20:51.351 --> 20:53.184
in the meantime,

20:53.186 --> 20:55.353
you should...

20:55.355 --> 20:57.255
stay here.

20:57.257 --> 20:59.257
Are you sure?

20:59.259 --> 21:00.458
Because I don't want
to put you guys out.

21:00.460 --> 21:03.828
No, no. We-we would all
love to have you.

21:05.465 --> 21:07.398
You're-you're gonna put
the fence back though, right?

21:07.400 --> 21:10.334
Nope.
It was over the property line.
