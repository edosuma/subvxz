00:03.998 --> 00:06.721
ER

00:06.923 --> 00:08.613
Previously on ER...

00:08.714 --> 00:10.334
Thank you. Thank you.

00:10.535 --> 00:12.315
- So, it's true?
- I've been trying to tell you.

00:12.316 --> 00:15.680
I'm not renewing my fellowship because
I'm applying for an Attending position.

00:15.681 --> 00:17.942
You should have had some sense.
Call your family!

00:17.943 --> 00:20.423
- It was not your decision, John.
- Sorry.

00:21.025 --> 00:24.704
- And here are some condoms. Use them.
- I will.

00:24.705 --> 00:26.487
The Bone Marrow Registry...

00:26.488 --> 00:29.698
...found eight people who
preliminarily match your marrow type.

00:29.699 --> 00:33.196
- David!
- I've got something in my eye. Could you...?

00:35.208 --> 00:37.031
Who the hell was that?

00:37.907 --> 00:39.731
"Gut Reaction"

00:39.732 --> 00:41.415
Yosh, I need a hand!

00:42.086 --> 00:44.379
- What have you got?
- Boxes.

00:44.593 --> 00:47.005
Antibiotics, clinic expendables.
Right here, Jerry.

00:47.184 --> 00:49.596
Thank you. Right here. Thanks.

00:49.775 --> 00:51.687
Heavy lifting is not
in my job description.

00:51.906 --> 00:54.865
- Where are we gonna put this stuff?
- Put it in the lounge.

00:55.081 --> 00:58.539
- Delivery dude's waiting on a check.
- I'll be right there.

00:59.887 --> 01:01.514
Carol? What is all this?

01:01.725 --> 01:06.480
Mrs. Carter came through with another
donation for medical supplies.

01:06.698 --> 01:09.658
I thought I'd stash them in the lounge
until I find a storage space.

01:09.832 --> 01:12.792
Far be it for me to want to impede
the good work of the clinic.

01:13.008 --> 01:15.218
So tonight's the big night, huh?

01:15.599 --> 01:17.845
- Need help?
- Everything's under control.

01:18.064 --> 01:22.021
I'm impressed that you volunteered
to do this year's ER banquet.

01:22.243 --> 01:23.823
Jerry's been helping me out.

01:24.039 --> 01:25.073
What's on the menu?

01:25.293 --> 01:28.585
We have herb-roasted chicken.
We have scalloped potatoes...

01:28.803 --> 01:31.346
Dr. Greene, things didn't go
quite as planned.

01:31.561 --> 01:33.688
- What do you mean?
- I didn't want to worry you.

01:33.901 --> 01:34.934
You're worrying me.

01:35.489 --> 01:37.866
The caterer couldn't do the spread
for the money we had.

01:38.080 --> 01:40.706
So I had to make
alternate arrangements.

01:40.963 --> 01:44.635
- I hope it's not a buffet.
- It's not. It's a smorgasbord.

01:44.849 --> 01:47.642
- Mark, do you have a minute?
- Sure.

01:47.816 --> 01:49.313
- Smorgasbord?
- It'll be great.

01:49.487 --> 01:52.030
I got a great Swedish caterer,
a friend of my Aunt Gretta's.

01:52.204 --> 01:54.450
What was that strange memo
from the dean about?

01:54.669 --> 01:59.006
Apparently, he wants to explore hiring
a Pediatric Emergency Attending.

01:59.224 --> 02:01.351
- And whose dumb idea was that?
- Doug's.

02:01.564 --> 02:04.404
Doug? Doug Ross went to the dean?

02:04.656 --> 02:06.986
And the dean thought it was
worth investigating.

02:07.205 --> 02:10.912
You're telling me that Doug's actually
interested in such a position?

02:11.091 --> 02:12.124
He might be.

02:12.303 --> 02:16.439
We are trained to handle anyone
who comes through the door.

02:16.649 --> 02:18.645
We do not need
a Pediatric Attending here.

02:18.822 --> 02:20.485
Don't worry. It won't happen.

02:20.702 --> 02:23.828
They'll make a committee,
determine that it's not cost-effective.

02:24.045 --> 02:25.708
It'll all be history.

02:25.967 --> 02:27.762
Ms. Beavans, let us run some tests.

02:27.973 --> 02:31.229
- I don't have time.
- She's got a fever and she's vomiting.

02:31.441 --> 02:34.317
If I don't get to work now,
I'm gonna be fired.

02:34.533 --> 02:37.374
- Just a few minutes.
- The nurse said that an hour ago!

02:37.584 --> 02:41.458
She could have a kidney infection
or worse. Let us get a urine sample.

02:41.637 --> 02:44.014
- I'll bring her back.
- I can't let you leave.

02:44.186 --> 02:46.016
- You can't stop me!
- Police would say I can.

02:46.192 --> 02:49.484
- You'd call the cops on me?
- Absolutely. For endangering a child.

02:49.702 --> 02:52.328
- I'll call the cops for kidnapping.
- What's going on?

02:52.502 --> 02:55.924
105 fever. She's been vomiting
for two days. No source of infection.

02:56.137 --> 02:57.468
He threatened to call the cops!

02:57.683 --> 03:00.060
- We can work this out without police.
- I'm sorry.

03:00.274 --> 03:02.852
I'm not letting you leave
without giving this child tests.

03:03.032 --> 03:06.323
Like hell you won't!
Bring her back or you're gonna be sorry!

03:06.500 --> 03:08.045
And he wants to be an Attending?

03:10.000 --> 03:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:00.949 --> 04:04.615
Pedialyte. Make sure she gets plenty
of that. Ibuprofen for fever.

04:04.787 --> 04:08.322
We'll call you with the test results.
You don't want me to call your boss?

04:08.542 --> 04:11.080
- Don't bother.
- Okay. All right.

04:11.253 --> 04:12.913
Son of a bitch.

04:13.088 --> 04:16.956
I hope it doesn't rain tonight.
I'm wearing a new dress.

04:17.135 --> 04:19.507
Not to worry.
It is not going to rain.

04:19.678 --> 04:21.968
The Channel 2 news said
it was gonna storm.

04:22.140 --> 04:25.925
They don't know what they're talking
about. No bursitis, no rain.

04:26.145 --> 04:28.767
Can I grab a ride with you and Anna
to the banquet?

04:28.981 --> 04:31.520
- Doug's working late.
- I'm not going with Anna.

04:32.820 --> 04:34.196
Did you two break up?

04:34.655 --> 04:37.444
- We're just friends.
- I thought you were dating.

04:37.909 --> 04:40.827
No, no, no. I mean, we've gotten
really close, but no.

04:40.996 --> 04:43.784
- You thought we were dating?
- I thought I picked up on something.

04:43.958 --> 04:45.120
Something that she said?

04:45.293 --> 04:48.793
No. I thought I picked up on some
chemistry between the two of you.

04:49.423 --> 04:51.665
I mean, there's been moments...

04:51.884 --> 04:54.173
...but you hate to screw up
a good friendship.

04:54.721 --> 04:57.675
That's lame, Carter. Ask her out.

04:59.643 --> 05:02.645
- I hope Romano doesn't page me.
- He keeps you on a short leash.

05:02.814 --> 05:05.851
I'd cut it in a heartbeat if I weren't
afraid of losing my visa.

05:06.027 --> 05:08.434
- Morgenstern might sponsor you.
- Out of the frying pan!

05:08.654 --> 05:11.359
- What do you mean?
- He's a strange fish, don't you think?

05:11.574 --> 05:12.688
No. Not really.

05:12.867 --> 05:14.362
- You respect him?
- Yes. Why?

05:14.578 --> 05:17.151
I heard he was cutting up cadavers
in the anatomy lab.

05:17.373 --> 05:18.653
- So?
- It's nothing.

05:18.875 --> 05:21.793
I suppose I'm looking for a convincing
reason not to go back home.

05:22.004 --> 05:23.877
Why? Is your fellowship up?

05:24.089 --> 05:27.339
No. I've been offered Senior Lecturer
at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital.

05:27.510 --> 05:28.542
Congratulations.

05:28.719 --> 05:31.556
I'm not sure I want to go back
into that old boys' network again.

05:31.764 --> 05:34.517
- Here a woman has a fighting chance.
- Ready? One, two...

05:34.727 --> 05:36.304
...three. Gently.

05:36.521 --> 05:39.806
71-year-old male, Lyle Swanson.
T- boned when a drunk ran a red.

05:40.025 --> 05:42.896
No LOC. BP, 150/98. Pulse, 90.

05:43.070 --> 05:45.442
- Resps 25. Minor lacs to-
- Allison?

05:45.865 --> 05:47.774
Look at you! How are you?

05:47.950 --> 05:50.074
I'm doing fine, Dr. Corday,
thanks to you.

05:50.287 --> 05:53.123
She's been on the job three days.
Wouldn't know she was a trainee.

05:53.291 --> 05:56.541
- How's your leg?
- I'm getting the strength back.

05:56.753 --> 05:59.755
- I'm thrilled for you.
- Can we finish the bullet, please?

05:59.924 --> 06:02.759
BP, 150/98. Pulse, 90. Resps, 25.

06:02.926 --> 06:05.964
Minor lacs to the head and lower
extremities. He noticed chest pains...

06:06.139 --> 06:08.512
- ... after hitting the steering wheel.
- Well done.

06:08.684 --> 06:10.261
Anytime. See you.

06:10.435 --> 06:11.599
No evidence of pneumo.

06:11.812 --> 06:14.019
Good peripheral pulse
without extremity tenderness.

06:14.190 --> 06:17.606
Pupils equal, disc margins clear.
What are you thinking?

06:17.777 --> 06:21.361
Worst-case scenario, cardiac contusion
or an aortic tear.

06:21.574 --> 06:23.947
- Start with a chest x-ray.
- Excuse me?

06:24.160 --> 06:27.364
Get a chest film.
I've got a paraesophageal hernia.

06:27.581 --> 06:29.288
Probably torsed my stomach.

06:29.458 --> 06:32.958
- Are you a doctor?
- Pathologist. Rule out a volvulus.

06:33.129 --> 06:35.288
Lydia, call for a portable chest.

06:36.800 --> 06:38.260
Peter, what do you think?

06:39.094 --> 06:41.467
I think Dr. Swanson just beat us
to the diagnosis.

06:41.639 --> 06:43.597
Are you going to this banquet tonight?

06:43.808 --> 06:45.516
It sounds kind of hokey.

06:45.727 --> 06:49.642
Actually, it was great fun last year.
It was a nice dinner. It's good wine.

06:49.857 --> 06:52.693
- Everybody ended up doing the limbo.
- I don't know.

06:52.903 --> 06:53.934
Come on.

06:54.113 --> 06:55.821
I guess. If you're gonna go.

06:55.990 --> 06:58.148
- Would you like to go together?
- Sure. Why not?

06:58.325 --> 07:00.900
- All right, I'll pick you up at 8:00.
- Great.

07:03.540 --> 07:04.785
Why didn't you say
there was a deposit?

07:05.000 --> 07:06.495
I thought you were taking care
of the band.

07:06.669 --> 07:08.662
If I had known there was a deposit,
I would've paid it.

07:08.838 --> 07:12.504
I've got 60 people showing up
there tonight. You cannot cancel-

07:12.718 --> 07:14.841
- Mark, telephone.
- Can you hold on?

07:15.012 --> 07:16.293
Is it important?

07:16.472 --> 07:18.679
It's the florist.
I'll say you're with a patient.

07:18.892 --> 07:19.924
What does she want?

07:20.101 --> 07:22.724
She tried to deliver your centerpieces
to the Shangri Lodge.

07:22.897 --> 07:24.688
Nobody was there to receive them.

07:24.857 --> 07:26.980
- Have them deliver it here.
- To the ER?

07:27.568 --> 07:30.273
Look, you've gotta be able to find
a band for me tonight.

07:30.488 --> 07:33.443
- I have a couple of buddies-
- Jerry, get back to work.

07:34.285 --> 07:36.029
What's that? The Machine?

07:36.537 --> 07:39.623
That sounds good. Fine. Book them.
I'll pay the late fee.

07:40.292 --> 07:41.323
Damn it!

07:41.502 --> 07:44.040
Labs are back on Quinesha Beavans.

07:44.255 --> 07:48.301
She's got Gram-negative rods in
her urine. Her CBC shows a left shift.

07:49.135 --> 07:50.714
- Urosepsis.
- Probably.

07:50.888 --> 07:53.973
It's good you had Mrs. Beavans
stick around so you could run tests.

07:54.142 --> 07:55.553
Tell Kerry Weaver about that.

07:56.311 --> 07:59.728
Want me to call her and make sure she
brings in Quinesha for IV antibiotics?

08:00.316 --> 08:02.308
I can be diplomatic, buddy.

08:03.027 --> 08:04.486
I know you can.

08:05.530 --> 08:08.151
Dr. Swanson made a correct
self-diagnosis.

08:08.408 --> 08:10.568
He's got a nasty-looking volvulus.

08:10.787 --> 08:12.530
He's gonna need a gastrectomy.

08:12.747 --> 08:14.704
Have you ever removed
the entire stomach?

08:14.874 --> 08:17.911
- No. What about you?
- In a frog.

08:18.129 --> 08:20.750
- Morning, folks.
- Good morning, Dr. Morgenstern.

08:20.923 --> 08:24.507
- So, what's on the agenda?
- A rather fascinating case.

08:24.762 --> 08:26.589
Pretty spiffy. Who is this?

08:26.806 --> 08:29.095
Lyle Swanson,
71-year-old physician who-

08:29.267 --> 08:30.891
Swanny?

08:37.275 --> 08:40.895
David Morgenstern, Dr. Swanson.
I took histology from you.

08:41.114 --> 08:42.859
You inspired me to become a surgeon.

08:43.575 --> 08:46.612
You made the most beautiful
axial slices of the brain.

08:47.330 --> 08:49.618
That means a great deal
coming from you, sir.

08:49.791 --> 08:53.125
Dr. Swanson is a world authority
on immunofluorescent tumor stains.

08:53.295 --> 08:57.376
I'm afraid you have a gastric torsion.

08:59.969 --> 09:02.971
I should've had that damned hernia
repaired years ago.

09:03.182 --> 09:05.934
Well, I had an Ml six months ago.

09:06.144 --> 09:07.639
I ignored the symptoms for weeks.

09:08.314 --> 09:09.476
What's your plan?

09:09.648 --> 09:12.566
We'll do an open procedure.
That way we can explore your belly.

09:12.819 --> 09:14.776
Can you operate laparoscopically?

09:15.488 --> 09:17.897
I believe your case is
too complicated for that.

09:18.074 --> 09:20.531
- Nonsense.
- A lap volvulus?

09:20.703 --> 09:23.277
It's less invasive.
The recovery time is quicker.

09:23.456 --> 09:24.534
What do you think?

09:26.000 --> 09:29.204
Well, it's worth a try. We can always
convert to an open procedure.

09:29.422 --> 09:33.670
Lily, book an O.R. in my name.
Which one of you would like to assist?

09:33.844 --> 09:35.635
Elizabeth...

09:36.305 --> 09:38.096
...you're the skeptic. How about it?

09:38.307 --> 09:39.470
Terrific.

09:39.642 --> 09:43.012
- Isn't a smorgasbord old-fashioned?
- It's gonna be great.

09:43.188 --> 09:44.730
I'd like to see a menu.

09:44.898 --> 09:48.350
We are having pickled herring,
Swedish meatballs, limpa bread.

09:48.569 --> 09:50.609
And my mom's making
a tub of borscht.

09:50.821 --> 09:52.945
Wait. Your mother's
doing the cooking?

09:53.157 --> 09:55.033
She's doing it for free.

09:55.244 --> 09:58.578
- Did you page me?
- Yeah. Got a bowel obstruction in 2.

09:58.789 --> 10:01.875
- You sure it's not just constipation?
- Yes, I'm sure.

10:02.086 --> 10:03.876
Hell of a job you ER docs have.

10:04.046 --> 10:08.174
You scout out the territory and call
in the big boys to go in for the kill.

10:09.886 --> 10:11.381
- You got a minute?
- Sure.

10:11.597 --> 10:15.594
The National Bone Marrow Registry
called. You gave some blood last week?

10:15.809 --> 10:19.014
In the drive for Dr. Anspaugh's son.
Don't tell me that I matched.

10:19.188 --> 10:22.523
Unfortunately not for Scotty.
But you matched an out-of-state patient.

10:22.734 --> 10:24.146
Wow! That's great.

10:24.362 --> 10:27.399
- That's a tough procedure, isn't it?
- It's not too bad.

10:27.574 --> 10:31.074
And if I can arrange it for today,
would you be willing to do it?

10:31.244 --> 10:32.573
That soon?

10:32.747 --> 10:36.199
The patient needs the marrow.
I'll give you some days off to recuperate.

10:36.376 --> 10:39.413
I can perform that procedure after
I check out this bowel obstruction.

10:39.588 --> 10:43.040
Yeah. And what exactly
does it involve?

10:43.259 --> 10:47.174
I'll drill about 50 small holes in
your pelvis and suck out the marrow.

10:49.015 --> 10:51.341
We'll give you an epidural.
You won't feel a thing.

10:51.519 --> 10:53.062
Piece of cake.

10:54.355 --> 10:56.479
- Think about it.
- Okay.

10:59.403 --> 11:03.318
Be honest with me. Do you think
I have what it takes to be an Attending?

11:03.532 --> 11:05.158
Of course you do.

11:05.911 --> 11:08.237
Think of me as diplomatic?

11:08.622 --> 11:11.328
- What does that have to do with it?
- Answer the question.

11:11.500 --> 11:13.494
It's not the first word
that springs to mind.

11:13.711 --> 11:16.084
What would the first word be?

11:16.465 --> 11:17.580
Stubborn.

11:17.800 --> 11:19.128
Opinionated.

11:19.593 --> 11:20.923
Insouciant.

11:22.680 --> 11:24.638
- Insouciant?
- Look it up.

11:52.466 --> 11:53.498
You know this one?

11:53.677 --> 11:57.010
We've only played it about a billion
times. Are you done eating this?

11:57.181 --> 11:59.304
- It's not very good.
- Yeah, I know.

11:59.516 --> 12:01.924
How about I order us a pizza?

12:03.187 --> 12:04.432
If you want.

12:04.646 --> 12:06.307
Maybe some rocky road for dessert?

12:09.903 --> 12:11.528
Is the pain getting worse?

12:11.823 --> 12:14.111
This thing isn't working
as good as it used to.

12:14.325 --> 12:17.529
I'll get Dr. Ross to adjust
it for you. Okay?

12:17.745 --> 12:19.371
Wait. Don't leave yet.

12:19.581 --> 12:21.207
This is the coolest part.

12:27.924 --> 12:29.799
Dr. Bad News.

12:33.347 --> 12:34.546
How are you feeling, son?

12:35.933 --> 12:40.347
Well, me and Jeanie
were gonna share a pizza.

12:44.903 --> 12:46.231
We...

12:46.405 --> 12:48.114
We need to talk.

12:53.747 --> 12:58.658
Your bone marrow failed to match
the last two potential donors.

12:59.170 --> 13:00.913
You win some, you lose some.

13:01.756 --> 13:04.083
Hey, we'll come up with Plan B.

13:04.885 --> 13:08.301
Okay? Your dad and I have
discussed some new therapies.

13:11.059 --> 13:13.052
There is something called...

13:13.895 --> 13:16.566
...a Phase One chemotherapy trial.

13:17.066 --> 13:20.566
But it's highly experimental.

13:21.196 --> 13:23.604
At least it's still
a possibility, right?

13:25.368 --> 13:26.398
Yes.

13:26.828 --> 13:30.695
It couldn't be any worse than the nuke
juice they've already given me.

13:32.376 --> 13:34.369
There could be some
severe side effects.

13:35.963 --> 13:39.085
And the chemo could...

13:39.258 --> 13:40.422
Make me croak.

13:42.429 --> 13:44.838
We don't have to make a decision
right this minute.

13:47.352 --> 13:48.976
What do you think, Jeanie?

13:49.980 --> 13:51.559
I think it's a chance.

13:52.524 --> 13:55.147
Would you stay with me
if I got the new chemo?

13:55.319 --> 13:56.483
Of course I would.

14:00.701 --> 14:02.902
I wanna do it.

14:12.807 --> 14:15.345
You sure lucked out getting that lap.

14:15.517 --> 14:19.217
- Do you like working with Morgenstern?
- Of course. He's one of the best.

14:19.563 --> 14:21.970
Why is it I don't feel comfortable
around him?

14:22.148 --> 14:23.607
Can't imagine.

14:24.776 --> 14:27.480
Last week he bolted out midway
through a pericardiocentesis.

14:27.695 --> 14:30.779
- Claimed he had something in his eye.
- Then he must have.

14:30.990 --> 14:33.065
It seemed to me like he froze up.

14:34.452 --> 14:35.696
I can't believe that.

14:36.203 --> 14:38.360
Let me tell you something
about Dr. Morgenstern.

14:38.580 --> 14:41.330
He's taught me more than all
the other Attendings combined.

14:41.999 --> 14:44.454
Maybe I'm looking for an excuse
to get out of this.

14:44.668 --> 14:48.001
I don't have much experience
of laparoscopic procedures.

14:48.964 --> 14:50.375
See, that's it.

14:51.049 --> 14:54.168
Whenever you're nervous
you go after the Attendings.

14:54.886 --> 14:56.511
Do I really?

14:58.848 --> 15:00.591
Well, I guess I do.

15:00.766 --> 15:04.051
- Have you ever done a lap volvulus?
- No. But I'd love to.

15:04.895 --> 15:06.306
In that case, be my guest.

15:09.399 --> 15:10.727
Are you serious?

15:10.942 --> 15:14.062
Yeah. I'll do your biopsy
and then I'll come observe you.

15:14.320 --> 15:16.027
Perhaps I'll learn something.

15:18.657 --> 15:19.985
Well...

15:20.367 --> 15:21.826
Okay.

15:23.036 --> 15:25.243
I owe you.

15:31.127 --> 15:32.324
David?

15:32.919 --> 15:35.244
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

15:35.422 --> 15:37.628
Oh, heavens, Kerry,
you never disturb me.

15:37.841 --> 15:39.880
Is that a lap volvulus?

15:40.134 --> 15:42.091
Heard you're doing one
on Dr. Swanson.

15:42.261 --> 15:45.427
Yeah. Just looking at one
of my old teaching tapes.

15:45.639 --> 15:49.055
Never hurts to review the finer points
of establishing a pneumoperitoneum.

15:49.226 --> 15:52.226
He told me that you were one
of his brightest students.

15:53.104 --> 15:54.266
Good old Swanny.

15:54.438 --> 15:57.771
He's from the old school of medicine.
Cares about the science and the soul.

15:59.402 --> 16:03.695
I came up to bring you the minutes
of the Blood Utilization Committee.

16:03.863 --> 16:06.533
Thought you might be interested
now that you're back on staff.

16:07.116 --> 16:08.610
You're always looking out for me.

16:09.036 --> 16:11.953
Which reminds me, are you coming
to the ER banquet tonight?

16:12.121 --> 16:13.781
You're part of the family.

16:13.955 --> 16:15.284
It sounds like great fun.

16:15.499 --> 16:18.500
- Good. I'll see you there.
- Right-o.

16:21.379 --> 16:24.166
So I spoke to
the pain management team.

16:24.924 --> 16:25.954
Sorry.

16:26.133 --> 16:27.793
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

16:28.010 --> 16:30.382
We're gonna increase
your morphine dosage.

16:30.596 --> 16:32.802
Okay. Where's Jeanie?

16:33.015 --> 16:35.304
She's probably down in the ER working.

16:35.641 --> 16:40.303
No. She promised to stay with me
when I get the new chemo.

16:40.730 --> 16:43.018
I spoke to your dad about that.
He's worried that...

16:43.191 --> 16:46.855
...you may not understand what it means
to be in a Phase One treatment study.

16:47.027 --> 16:50.478
I know. The chemo
could make me a lot sicker.

16:50.697 --> 16:53.448
Yeah, it can. You're willing
to go through with that?

16:56.494 --> 16:58.652
Hey, Jeanie. Where have you been?

16:58.870 --> 17:01.658
I was down in the gift shop.
I got you a little something.

17:01.831 --> 17:03.077
A new Hot Rod.

17:03.501 --> 17:05.872
You let me read that
when you're done, all right?

17:06.670 --> 17:08.212
Scott and I were just talking...

17:08.378 --> 17:11.830
...about the pros and cons
of a Phase One study.

17:12.174 --> 17:14.961
And I was telling Dr. Ross
that we're gonna go for it.

17:15.135 --> 17:18.136
- He's a pretty brave guy.
- Yes, he is. Very brave.

17:20.140 --> 17:22.013
Yes, I'll hold.

17:22.392 --> 17:26.554
So I talked to Anna, and we're going
together. But don't call it a date.

17:26.771 --> 17:30.518
No, no. It's urgent. I have to
speak to Mrs. Carter immediately.

17:30.691 --> 17:33.228
Well, page her out
of her board meeting.

17:33.610 --> 17:35.687
- What's going on?
- Carol wrote a bad check.

17:35.862 --> 17:37.522
Her medical supplies
are getting repo'd.

17:37.738 --> 17:39.529
Your grandmother wrote me this.

17:40.241 --> 17:42.946
Could you please have her
call me back? Thank you.

17:43.202 --> 17:45.871
She put a stop payment
on her foundation check?

17:46.497 --> 17:47.991
What did you do?

17:49.207 --> 17:51.200
Nothing. Last week
we had some bad press.

17:51.417 --> 17:53.326
We gave out birth control to teens.

17:53.545 --> 17:57.079
Gamma isn't anti-birth control.
She does hate publicity, though.

17:57.298 --> 17:58.672
What should I do?

17:59.174 --> 18:02.258
You could promise that you won't
use her money for birth control.

18:02.427 --> 18:03.839
I would if I could reach her.

18:04.012 --> 18:06.051
Dr. C, eye exam in 1.

18:06.598 --> 18:08.922
I'm sure it's just
a big misunderstanding.

18:10.894 --> 18:12.553
- Is the patient ready?
- He's asleep.

18:12.728 --> 18:15.812
Okay. The monitor goes
at the head of the table.

18:16.022 --> 18:18.015
The endoscopic tower's
on the wrong side.

18:18.191 --> 18:20.019
Dr. Morgenstern requested it this way.

18:20.193 --> 18:22.400
- Are you sure?
- Yes, doctor. Quite sure.

18:22.612 --> 18:26.312
Shirley! How nice to see you!
You still collecting old 45s?

18:26.533 --> 18:30.067
Just picked up a rare Buddy Holly.
It's great to have you back.

18:30.284 --> 18:32.408
Well, it's good to be home.

18:32.871 --> 18:36.489
Peter? I thought your associate
was going to assist.

18:36.708 --> 18:40.123
She's doing a biopsy,
so she'll be by later to observe.

18:40.336 --> 18:43.372
So it's you and me!
Just like old times.

18:43.588 --> 18:47.918
Shirley, I left a CD of some Peruvian
panpipe music by the scrub sink.

18:48.135 --> 18:51.337
- Would you mind putting it on?
- Not at all, Dr. Morgenstern.

18:51.513 --> 18:54.182
You'll like this, Peter.
The music is mysterious...

18:54.891 --> 18:56.883
...and yet soothing.

18:57.935 --> 19:00.805
You have a scratch
on your cornea, Mr. Bartlett.

19:01.021 --> 19:03.975
I'll be right back with some
antibiotic eye drops for you.

19:04.357 --> 19:06.978
- Carter, do you have a minute?
- Sure.

19:07.610 --> 19:09.935
- Is something wrong?
- No.

19:10.154 --> 19:14.531
I matched for a transplant candidate
from the blood we donated last week.

19:14.741 --> 19:17.447
- You're gonna donate bone marrow?
- Yeah.

19:17.661 --> 19:19.653
- That's great.
- Yeah.

19:19.830 --> 19:22.616
But I guess I won't make it
to the banquet tonight.

19:22.791 --> 19:26.622
Yeah. No. You should be sore
for a couple of days.

19:26.794 --> 19:28.952
Why? It's a simple procedure, right?

19:29.129 --> 19:30.375
Not much to it.

19:30.548 --> 19:33.797
- Have you ever done one?
- About 12 or so last year.

19:34.509 --> 19:35.540
Would you do mine?

19:36.803 --> 19:39.128
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:39.639 --> 19:43.967
I don't mean to sound like a wimp.
I just feel a little nervous about it.

19:45.394 --> 19:47.303
I've never even seen you flinch.

19:47.645 --> 19:50.136
- Not even in the bloodiest traumas.
- I'm serious.

19:50.315 --> 19:51.975
It's different when
you're the patient.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.143
Just a big chicken, huh?

19:55.069 --> 19:57.820
- Don't rub it in, please.
- No. Hey, it's just...

19:58.740 --> 20:00.981
- It's surprising.
- If you don't want to do it, fine.

20:01.199 --> 20:04.070
I'd be honored. I'll do it as soon as
I'm finished with my patient.

20:04.494 --> 20:07.779
Okay. Thanks. Appreciate it.

20:08.665 --> 20:10.123
Bye.

20:11.209 --> 20:13.877
Mark, did Romano see
that kid with the appy?

20:14.086 --> 20:16.043
Yeah. He's examining him now.

20:16.254 --> 20:20.038
- Is everything set for the banquet?
- Seems to be moving right along.

20:20.259 --> 20:22.748
The University Club put on
such a lovely banquet last year.

20:22.927 --> 20:24.338
It's too bad it wasn't available.

20:24.512 --> 20:28.378
It was. I just thought the Shangri
Lodge would be a different choice.

20:28.599 --> 20:31.967
You actually chose the Shangri Lodge
over the University Club?

20:32.144 --> 20:34.680
- A little less pretentious.
- Whatever you say.

20:34.896 --> 20:37.020
That appy kid's dry as a bone.
Buff him up.

20:37.190 --> 20:39.681
Give him 200 cc's normal saline
every 15 minutes.

20:39.859 --> 20:43.358
That's too much fluid for a kid.
I already gave him two 500 cc boluses.

20:43.529 --> 20:46.102
I want you to give him
200 cc's every 15 minutes...

20:46.323 --> 20:47.864
...then send him up to the O.R.

20:48.074 --> 20:51.277
- You fluid-overload these patients.
- Follow my orders on the chart.

20:51.452 --> 20:54.405
In my ER, I'll manage the patients
the way I see fit!

20:54.580 --> 20:56.123
Hey, Greene!

20:58.792 --> 21:01.912
I guess you got some stones after all.
You're the boss.

21:04.965 --> 21:09.875
We'll free up the esophagus
with a harmonic scalpel.

21:10.886 --> 21:13.887
When I was a Resident,
we didn't have cautery.

21:14.557 --> 21:17.557
We had to tie every vessel.

21:19.644 --> 21:20.972
Tell me, Peter.

21:21.146 --> 21:24.348
Where do you find the branches of the
vagus at this level of the esophagus?

21:24.524 --> 21:28.602
They become the anterior and posterior.
You cut them, the stomach won't empty.

21:28.819 --> 21:30.064
Right you are.

21:30.487 --> 21:34.734
Speaking of "empty" and "stomach,"
anyone try that new Mexican restaurant?

21:34.949 --> 21:37.951
I heard they make
a great chimichanga.

21:39.912 --> 21:41.572
Shirley, turn down the thermostat.

21:41.746 --> 21:42.779
Right away, sir.

21:42.956 --> 21:45.447
- Are you okay?
- Of course.

21:45.667 --> 21:48.751
I was doing laps back when those
monitors were still black-and-white.

21:48.920 --> 21:50.581
- Dr. Morgenstern?
- What?

21:51.839 --> 21:54.757
You're dissecting the edge
of the esophagus.

21:55.092 --> 21:57.547
Thank you, doctor,
but I don't need instruction.

21:58.262 --> 22:01.262
Boy, that phrenic ligament
is really fibrous.

22:01.890 --> 22:03.681
Are you sure it's not mucosa?

22:04.433 --> 22:05.513
Damn it!

22:05.894 --> 22:08.431
Peter, your job is to assist me.
Anticipate my moves.

22:08.646 --> 22:10.888
I am. But he's got varices.
You could nick one.

22:11.064 --> 22:13.187
Turn the music off.

22:13.692 --> 22:16.811
Don't pull so hard with the Babcock.
You'll tear the gastric artery.

22:16.986 --> 22:18.944
- I'm not pulling.
- The hell you're not!

22:19.114 --> 22:21.023
Dr. Morgenstern,
you're obscuring my field.

22:21.533 --> 22:23.738
Oh, son of a bitch!
You tore the left gastric.

22:23.951 --> 22:26.323
- I wasn't anywhere near it.
- Suction.

22:26.536 --> 22:29.109
Give me a 10 mm sucker,
open-ended. Let's move.

22:29.289 --> 22:32.206
- I can't see what I'm coagulating.
- All right. We have to open.

22:32.375 --> 22:34.368
No, no, no.
We can control the bleeding.

22:34.586 --> 22:37.836
Every time I suck, the abdominal wall
collapses. I can't see a thing.

22:38.173 --> 22:39.452
Well, then stop sucking.

22:40.091 --> 22:41.798
- What are you wearing?
- My velvet dress.

22:41.967 --> 22:43.130
The one you wore last year?

22:43.301 --> 22:46.302
I didn't pass out and rip mine in
the parking lot like someone I know.

22:46.471 --> 22:48.049
Jeanie, you going to the banquet?

22:48.222 --> 22:50.299
No, I'll finish some charts
and stay with Scott.

22:50.475 --> 22:52.017
- No luck with a donor match?
- No.

22:52.226 --> 22:54.468
Hey, Jeanie. Can I talk to you?

22:55.270 --> 22:58.722
I'm concerned about Scott. You sure
he wants this experimental treatment?

22:58.940 --> 23:00.767
- Why? Did he say he didn't?
- No.

23:00.984 --> 23:04.020
- What are you concerned about?
- He's got this crush on you.

23:04.236 --> 23:05.815
Doug, the boy is 12 years old.

23:05.988 --> 23:09.108
12-year-olds get bigtime crushes.
He'll do anything to please you.

23:09.283 --> 23:10.860
He just wants a chance to get better.

23:11.034 --> 23:13.193
- Have you seen how he looks at you?
- You overreact.

23:13.370 --> 23:15.161
He lights up when you're around.

23:15.372 --> 23:19.121
I think that he's taking the chemo
because he thinks you want him to.

23:19.417 --> 23:21.623
No. I want him
to make his own decision.

23:21.836 --> 23:24.161
I know that you do.
I don't know that he can.

23:32.303 --> 23:33.335
Pressure's dropping.

23:33.512 --> 23:36.085
- He's lost too much blood. Let's open.
- Let's do a midline.

23:36.265 --> 23:39.598
Instrument tray. Two more units
of cross-matched. Let's move.

23:39.810 --> 23:40.841
- Scalpel.
- Hemostat.

23:41.062 --> 23:42.852
He's a bloody mess.

23:43.022 --> 23:45.690
- Get that liver out of the way.
- Deaver retractor. Let's move.

23:45.899 --> 23:48.188
- His varices are bleeding.
- Suction!

23:48.360 --> 23:49.558
3-0 silk on a pass.

23:49.735 --> 23:50.850
- See the bleeder?
- Not yet.

23:51.029 --> 23:53.068
- Bradying down.
- Two more units of blood.

23:53.280 --> 23:55.771
- Okay, we gotta crack him.
- Let me suture.

23:55.991 --> 23:58.826
- We've gotta stop the bleeding.
- Shove your hand in there and squeeze.

23:58.994 --> 24:01.485
- We're losing him.
- I can't find the bleeder.

24:01.704 --> 24:03.330
We've gotta crack him.

24:03.540 --> 24:04.701
It's these damn varices.

24:04.874 --> 24:06.498
Doctor, it's been three minutes.

24:06.918 --> 24:09.455
Damn it! He's dying. Move!

24:12.214 --> 24:13.245
Rib-spreader!

24:13.674 --> 24:16.247
Damn it, I said rib-spreader!
Let's move, people!

24:16.885 --> 24:18.509
Satinsky.

24:19.471 --> 24:22.222
Okay, aorta's clamped.
Do we have a pulse?

24:22.390 --> 24:24.715
No pulse. He's in V-fib.

24:24.933 --> 24:27.175
All right.
I'm starting internal massage.

24:27.393 --> 24:28.508
Still in V-fib.

24:28.729 --> 24:31.350
The lungs aren't expanding.
Increase the volume.

24:31.522 --> 24:33.729
Lap pad. I can't get a grip.

24:34.776 --> 24:36.353
Still no pulse.

24:36.777 --> 24:37.809
Give me the epi.

24:38.362 --> 24:40.817
Come on! Let's move! Let's go!

24:44.344 --> 24:46.218
The tray is ready.
Here are your gloves.

24:46.388 --> 24:48.925
- Thanks, Kit.
- Call me if you need anything.

24:49.432 --> 24:50.925
Carter, are you ready?

24:54.268 --> 24:55.596
Epidural didn't hurt a bit.

24:55.811 --> 24:58.764
I told you, you had absolutely
nothing to be nervous about.

24:58.938 --> 25:02.686
Sure. That's what they told me
when I had my tonsils out.

25:03.274 --> 25:05.101
I was 12.

25:05.401 --> 25:09.232
I was in terrible pain after the operation,
so they gave me Dilaudid.

25:09.486 --> 25:12.061
They gave me too much
and I couldn't wake up.

25:12.281 --> 25:16.906
It was really weird, you know.
I could hear the nurses' voices.

25:17.117 --> 25:19.786
And I couldn't speak or move.

25:19.995 --> 25:21.903
I thought I was gonna die.

25:22.538 --> 25:24.447
And then I made a promise to God.

25:24.623 --> 25:26.780
And I said, "If you let me live...

25:26.958 --> 25:29.792
...I'll be a good person
for the rest of my life. "

25:30.085 --> 25:33.536
And you came to and decided to devote
your life to medicine?

25:33.754 --> 25:34.786
Something like that.

25:38.674 --> 25:40.632
I'm really relieved
you're doing this. Thanks.

25:44.053 --> 25:46.259
Don't tell me when you'll
stick the needle in.

25:46.472 --> 25:48.878
I won't. I'll prep
with a little Betadine.

25:49.099 --> 25:50.723
All right.

26:01.566 --> 26:03.723
Your drape fell off a little bit.

26:08.821 --> 26:10.729
All right. Here comes the Betadine.

26:11.781 --> 26:14.271
I can't let you examine him
until after the autopsy.

26:14.450 --> 26:17.449
I know. I just want
to review the anatomy.

26:17.619 --> 26:20.453
That's quite an unusual request.
Why are you so interested?

26:20.621 --> 26:24.700
Well, you know, it all happened
so unexpectedly. I just...

26:24.916 --> 26:28.498
I've known Dr. Swanson for 20 years.
It's not easy for me either.

26:28.711 --> 26:32.457
So do you think it would be possible
to sit in on the autopsy?

26:33.839 --> 26:36.294
Sure. Tomorrow, 4 p. m.

26:36.465 --> 26:37.496
Thanks.

26:39.008 --> 26:41.500
You down here checking
on the Swanson autopsy?

26:41.678 --> 26:44.678
Yeah. I assisted on the case.

26:45.305 --> 26:48.590
I know. David Morgenstern
filled me in.

26:49.558 --> 26:52.262
Alice, when do you expect
to have the report?

26:52.477 --> 26:53.674
In a couple of days.

26:53.895 --> 26:55.175
The sooner the better.

26:57.731 --> 26:59.224
I'm sorry about what happened.

26:59.440 --> 27:01.230
- Is there a problem?
- No. Not really.

27:01.441 --> 27:05.189
I spoke to David about the argument
in the O.R. He downplayed it.

27:05.361 --> 27:06.392
Right.

27:06.570 --> 27:10.945
Understand Dr. Swanson had cirrhotic
liver, varices, secondary to hep B.

27:11.156 --> 27:12.699
Yeah, he did have varices.

27:12.867 --> 27:14.989
No wonder you couldn't
stop the hemorrhaging.

27:15.201 --> 27:18.201
We'll run an M and M, see if we can
learn something from this tragedy.

27:18.371 --> 27:21.820
Why don't you take charge?
Gather all the charts and the tape.

27:22.289 --> 27:23.320
The tape?

27:23.707 --> 27:28.202
We often tape laparoscopic procedures.
See if the operation was recorded.

27:28.419 --> 27:31.953
If it was, you can take us all
through it step by step.

27:34.214 --> 27:36.206
We shouldn't leave these here.

27:36.382 --> 27:38.874
- What are these?
- It's a miniature stethoscope.

27:39.052 --> 27:40.628
It's a theme. Dumb idea?

27:40.803 --> 27:42.841
No. Just tacky.

27:43.888 --> 27:46.426
- Did you talk to Gamma yet?
- She never returned my call.

27:46.640 --> 27:48.715
- This might not be about you.
- What?

27:48.891 --> 27:51.050
- I'll go talk to her after I get off.
- Thanks.

27:51.227 --> 27:54.143
And by the way,
Anna said she'd call you later.

27:54.354 --> 27:56.927
She was in a lot of pain,
took a taxi home.

27:57.148 --> 27:58.890
Guess she's gonna miss the banquet.

28:01.859 --> 28:03.519
Viper convertible.

28:04.111 --> 28:05.521
It's pretty cool, huh?

28:06.738 --> 28:09.192
Yeah. I'm gonna get one just like it.

28:09.406 --> 28:13.237
Cobalt blue with a white racing stripe
down the middle.

28:15.327 --> 28:16.905
Think you can handle it?

28:17.079 --> 28:19.450
You'll see when I take you for a ride.

28:20.206 --> 28:22.244
You haven't mentioned
your friends lately.

28:22.416 --> 28:25.949
You want me to give them a call
and maybe have some guys come visit?

28:27.043 --> 28:28.419
Not really.

28:29.546 --> 28:30.920
They're...

28:31.797 --> 28:34.418
...I don't know, just kids.

28:35.216 --> 28:36.709
I'd rather be with you.

28:38.885 --> 28:42.005
Look at those wheels. Magnesium.

28:44.931 --> 28:47.682
- What are you doing?
- Applying for a loan.

28:47.850 --> 28:48.882
What?

28:49.059 --> 28:52.060
If I can't depend on the foundation
and until I get some new grants...

28:52.229 --> 28:54.553
...I'm taking out a loan
to keep the clinic open.

28:55.440 --> 28:56.600
- Am I losing my mind?
- Maybe.

28:56.773 --> 28:59.228
Six-month-old twins
in respiratory distress!

29:00.818 --> 29:03.603
Parents said they have the flu.
They're down in the waiting room.

29:04.153 --> 29:06.441
Get me a Pediatric crash cart
and clear Trauma 2!

29:06.613 --> 29:09.186
I got him. Come on. Come on.

29:09.657 --> 29:10.855
I know.

29:13.118 --> 29:14.825
Shirley, can you help me?

29:15.035 --> 29:17.408
I gave the nursing notes
to Dr. Morgenstern.

29:17.622 --> 29:19.494
Was there a tape made?

29:19.706 --> 29:20.737
I didn't make one.

29:20.915 --> 29:23.203
But if there was a tape made,
where would it be?

29:23.376 --> 29:25.912
Try the O.R.
The equipment's still in there.

29:26.503 --> 29:27.581
Thank you.

29:28.212 --> 29:30.085
Check the video recorder.

29:38.886 --> 29:40.427
Damn it!

29:40.887 --> 29:43.508
- Draw a racemic epi.
- Yosh, help Doug. I'll help Mark.

29:43.722 --> 29:46.130
- Need a hand?
- Yeah. Get the O-2.

29:46.308 --> 29:49.059
- Carol, I need the line.
- This one is wheezing and retracting.

29:49.269 --> 29:50.643
Pulse ox, 92.

29:50.853 --> 29:55.348
Yosh, get me albuterol nebulizer,
0.5 cc's, and two of saline.

29:55.690 --> 29:56.720
She's not breathing.

29:57.023 --> 29:59.478
Lily, intubation tray.
Carol, I need that line.

29:59.651 --> 30:02.320
- I can't get a vein.
- I'll go in interosseus.

30:02.527 --> 30:03.987
All right. Let's move her up.

30:04.654 --> 30:07.655
- How's the other one?
- Stable. Yosh, move her out of here.

30:10.325 --> 30:11.653
I can't see the cords.

30:11.868 --> 30:14.619
- Laryngeal edema.
- Probably syncytial virus.

30:14.828 --> 30:17.663
She's cyanotic. Trach tray, suction.

30:17.873 --> 30:19.911
- Hold the suction. Hang on.
- What?

30:20.124 --> 30:23.077
Wait for an air bubble.
Follow it down with the tube.

30:25.085 --> 30:26.283
- Okay.
- All right?

30:29.381 --> 30:30.660
I see the bubble.

30:33.550 --> 30:34.960
I'm in.

30:35.218 --> 30:36.676
Bag her.

30:44.307 --> 30:45.801
Peter...

30:46.101 --> 30:47.678
...I've been looking for you.

30:49.019 --> 30:51.510
You're one of the finest Residents
I've ever worked with.

30:51.687 --> 30:54.474
What happened today has no bearing
on those feelings whatsoever.

30:54.690 --> 30:57.856
I plan to support you
in any way I possibly can.

30:58.067 --> 30:59.098
Support me?

30:59.277 --> 31:03.568
I'm prepared to review this case
strictly on medical facts.

31:03.738 --> 31:04.769
Of course.

31:04.947 --> 31:07.520
I believe Dr. Swanson died
from ruptured varices.

31:10.368 --> 31:11.565
That's not what happened.

31:13.078 --> 31:14.453
What do you think happened?

31:14.705 --> 31:16.446
Well...

31:23.918 --> 31:26.374
You accidentally cut
the gastric artery.

31:27.005 --> 31:30.372
I've been a surgeon for 20 years.
I've never accidentally cut anything.

31:31.674 --> 31:33.050
Then how did he bleed out?

31:33.426 --> 31:35.417
You avulsed the left gastric
with your clamp.

31:35.719 --> 31:37.426
No, I didn't.

31:37.679 --> 31:39.801
The tape of the procedure
will show that.

31:40.014 --> 31:41.591
What tape?

31:41.764 --> 31:43.223
I was hoping you made one.

31:44.350 --> 31:45.974
Sorry.

31:46.894 --> 31:49.383
Let's not let this escalate, Peter.

31:49.604 --> 31:52.474
I could make this an issue
of your insubordination.

31:52.647 --> 31:53.846
I don't want to do that.

31:54.023 --> 31:55.730
I would've never taken over if I-

31:55.900 --> 31:59.434
You did more than that! You pushed
me away from the operating table!

31:59.652 --> 32:00.897
That's grounds for dismissal.

32:01.112 --> 32:02.736
If a man's life wasn't at stake-

32:02.905 --> 32:05.062
A man's life was at stake.

32:05.365 --> 32:07.155
And that life was lost.

32:08.325 --> 32:12.073
I'd appreciate it if your preparation
for M and M focused on the medicine...

32:12.245 --> 32:14.735
...and not hypotheticals
and accusations.

32:15.414 --> 32:18.868
Dr. Swanson deserves at least
that measure of dignity.

32:25.667 --> 32:28.953
The clinic's done a lot of good work
in the family's name.

32:29.171 --> 32:30.499
I'm glad you feel that way.

32:30.672 --> 32:33.673
So doesn't it make sense
to continue funding it?

32:34.009 --> 32:38.339
I think it's time Carol Hathaway
looked for other funding sources.

32:39.015 --> 32:41.506
She's worked very hard
to make a go of this clinic.

32:41.726 --> 32:44.431
It's not fair to pull the rug
right out from underneath her.

32:44.604 --> 32:47.011
I'm surprised at your interest
in the foundation.

32:47.232 --> 32:49.189
How many years have I tried
to involve you...

32:49.359 --> 32:51.067
...in our family's
charitable activities?

32:51.236 --> 32:52.695
This isn't about the foundation.

32:54.365 --> 32:55.610
What is it about?

32:55.907 --> 32:59.277
You're angry with me about Chase.
You're taking it out on the clinic.

33:00.830 --> 33:05.243
I am angry that your cousin will be
debilitated for the rest of his life.

33:05.459 --> 33:07.786
It's not something
I would take out on others.

33:08.004 --> 33:10.044
Chase barely accepted my help!

33:10.257 --> 33:12.214
He didn't want the family to know.

33:12.884 --> 33:15.921
None of you wants the family
involved in your lives.

33:16.138 --> 33:18.177
That's unfair.
I care about the family.

33:19.851 --> 33:21.724
You certainly care about the money.

33:23.355 --> 33:24.385
What?

33:24.980 --> 33:27.390
You live off a family trust, John.

33:29.319 --> 33:32.736
Gamma, if that is all you think of me,
then you can keep your money.

33:33.699 --> 33:35.407
As you wish, John.

33:44.878 --> 33:46.337
David?

33:47.922 --> 33:50.959
Hi. You know,
I heard about Dr. Swanson.

33:51.176 --> 33:52.885
Hard losing Swanny like that.

33:53.095 --> 33:55.254
Why don't you come with me
to the banquet?

33:55.472 --> 33:57.845
Thank you, Kerry.
I just want to go home.

33:59.518 --> 34:02.520
Mark. You know,
I've been thinking all day...

34:02.729 --> 34:06.680
...about the proposal for a Pedes
Attending. I think we should fight it.

34:06.859 --> 34:10.027
I'm a little torn. I just saw Doug Ross
save a 6-month-old's life.

34:10.196 --> 34:13.233
Doug is a good pediatrician.
He's not management material.

34:13.449 --> 34:15.194
He's never been interested before.

34:15.409 --> 34:19.456
It's not just Doug. It's a policy change
that would undermine our authority.

34:19.623 --> 34:21.911
I'm not worried about my authority.

34:22.126 --> 34:25.460
I think ER Attendings run
the best emergency department.

34:25.672 --> 34:27.630
I agree. Good.

34:27.924 --> 34:29.299
All right, see, watch this.

34:29.509 --> 34:31.088
Let me get you right on the...

34:33.639 --> 34:35.216
I'll be right back.

34:35.974 --> 34:40.138
Quinesha came back for IV antibiotics.
I was just entertaining her.

34:41.647 --> 34:42.678
How's her mom's job?

34:42.857 --> 34:45.692
- I called her work. She'll be fine.
- Good for you.

34:45.902 --> 34:49.603
You would've done the same. Listen,
I'm serious about the Attending thing.

34:51.074 --> 34:52.866
- You ought to give it a shot.
- Yeah?

34:53.034 --> 34:55.027
Yeah. Here we go, kiddo.

34:56.496 --> 34:59.831
Dr. Swanson taught half the Attendings
here. Everybody loved him.

35:00.751 --> 35:03.456
I'd get all my ducks in a row
if I were you, Peter.

35:03.670 --> 35:04.999
I did nothing wrong.

35:05.214 --> 35:07.705
- Rumor has it you took over.
- I had no choice.

35:07.926 --> 35:11.011
That's your opinion. But justified
or not, you're a Resident.

35:11.179 --> 35:13.006
And Morgenstern's the Chief.

35:17.519 --> 35:19.179
I'm sorry.

35:22.358 --> 35:24.149
So much for your bursitis.

35:24.360 --> 35:28.856
I'm sorry. Look, hot borscht will
be up in five minutes, all right?

35:30.408 --> 35:33.860
- Has anybody seen the band?
- I don't see any food either.

35:34.037 --> 35:36.160
Don't they usually
serve hors d'oeuvres?

35:36.331 --> 35:38.657
Wouldn't wanna spoil your appetite
for the smorgasbord.

35:38.875 --> 35:40.869
The bartender just asked me
for a drink ticket.

35:41.045 --> 35:42.871
- I didn't bring any cash.
- Here.

35:43.047 --> 35:44.292
- One each?
- Hey, buddy.

35:44.507 --> 35:46.049
Hey! Come here. Come here.

35:46.760 --> 35:48.218
Kind of an unusual place.

35:48.427 --> 35:50.587
It's different, you know.
But it's great.

35:51.180 --> 35:53.221
- It's a disaster.
- I wouldn't say that.

35:53.434 --> 35:54.595
You want another drink?

35:54.810 --> 35:56.601
It's really nice, Mark.

35:56.812 --> 35:57.891
Mark Greene?

35:58.605 --> 36:00.017
I'm The Machine.

36:00.358 --> 36:02.065
- Band's here.
- Excellent. Great.

36:02.235 --> 36:04.441
You guys need some help
bringing your stuff in?

36:04.611 --> 36:06.071
No guys. Just me.

36:06.531 --> 36:07.562
You're The Machine?

36:08.700 --> 36:09.732
The whole Machine?

36:20.588 --> 36:22.628
Hey! Carter!

36:22.839 --> 36:24.584
Over by the moose!

36:25.468 --> 36:27.507
I couldn't get my grandmother
to listen.

36:27.720 --> 36:28.752
Somebody did.

36:28.930 --> 36:32.464
She messengered over another check.
Whatever you said really worked.

36:32.642 --> 36:33.673
Thank you so much.

36:33.852 --> 36:34.884
- Come on.
- I'm coming.

36:35.062 --> 36:36.889
Watch your head on the moose.

36:42.236 --> 36:43.860
Why aren't you home in bed?

36:44.071 --> 36:47.026
What? And miss my first ER banquet?

36:47.241 --> 36:48.272
How's the pain?

36:48.450 --> 36:51.902
It's okay now after
a couple of Percodan.

36:52.121 --> 36:55.324
Makes for a very pleasant banquet.
I should pass them around.

36:55.542 --> 36:56.823
Well, you look...

36:57.044 --> 36:58.621
Thanks. So do you.

37:00.130 --> 37:03.630
You know, we've kind of been dancing
around this thing a little bit.

37:03.843 --> 37:08.054
And this afternoon
during the bone marrow...

37:08.222 --> 37:13.099
A couple of points during the year
I kind of felt like we had chemistry.

37:14.730 --> 37:16.806
- Or not.
- No.

37:16.981 --> 37:20.149
No, you're right. I mean,
there's definitely been, you know...

37:20.360 --> 37:22.484
All right. Well, let me say this.

37:23.947 --> 37:27.946
I haven't made a move because I didn't
want to screw up our friendship.

37:28.161 --> 37:30.866
Yeah. I know.
You've been a great friend.

37:31.080 --> 37:33.322
The only real friend
I've made here, actually.

37:35.126 --> 37:36.157
But?

37:37.004 --> 37:40.004
But? But there's this other guy.

37:41.550 --> 37:43.543
That guy you told me about in Philly?

37:43.761 --> 37:45.670
The guy with the drug problem?

37:45.971 --> 37:49.257
Well, I think that's past him now.
So I'm...

37:49.475 --> 37:53.770
We were together for a long time.
We've not been together for a while.

37:53.939 --> 37:55.349
So it's not completely over.

37:57.734 --> 38:00.190
I guess I'm just not quite there yet.
You know?

38:00.362 --> 38:02.520
- But...
- Hey, I understand.

38:03.615 --> 38:05.275
- You do?
- Yeah.

38:05.451 --> 38:06.945
Yeah, I understand.

38:07.454 --> 38:08.698
What are friends for?

38:11.707 --> 38:13.784
Dr. Greene, the crowd's
getting restless.

38:13.960 --> 38:17.495
Give them some drink tickets
while The Machine is setting up.

38:17.714 --> 38:19.125
Alrighty.

38:19.717 --> 38:21.210
Saved by the smorgasbord!

38:21.426 --> 38:24.546
Ladies and gentlemen,
dinner is served!

38:29.811 --> 38:31.352
- What happened?
- He's arrested.

38:31.562 --> 38:32.974
- Fever's 104.
- Is he septic?

38:33.190 --> 38:36.024
That's what happens when
they get to this state.

38:36.193 --> 38:39.064
- He was about to start a Phase One.
- Poor kid.

38:40.238 --> 38:41.781
Let's give him two of epi.

38:41.991 --> 38:43.734
Would you mind taking over
the bagging?

38:43.909 --> 38:45.902
Somebody should call his father.

38:46.244 --> 38:49.033
Why don't these parents
just let these poor kids go?

38:50.124 --> 38:51.156
We've got a rhythm.

38:52.251 --> 38:55.538
Okay, let's give him tobra and ceftaz.

38:55.755 --> 38:57.998
- Do you want hydrocortisone?
- Yes, please.

38:58.425 --> 39:00.917
Good work, everyone.
We have got him back.

39:22.409 --> 39:24.201
Carol, are your meatballs frozen?

39:24.411 --> 39:26.404
I think they' re just a little cold.

39:26.623 --> 39:27.736
What is this?

39:27.957 --> 39:29.784
Jerry says it's called pyttipanna.

39:30.001 --> 39:32.077
- What's that?
- I have no idea.

39:32.295 --> 39:33.919
Excuse me. Hello.

39:34.798 --> 39:37.371
I just wanted to say
thank you for coming tonight.

39:38.802 --> 39:42.052
I organized this event in hopes...

39:42.264 --> 39:45.134
...to show my appreciation
for all of your great work.

39:45.643 --> 39:48.313
So try not to hold tonight against me.

39:49.104 --> 39:52.142
Each day we work together
as a family.

39:52.984 --> 39:56.898
Because we're a family, it's no secret
that it's been a rough year for me.

39:57.489 --> 40:00.739
So I want to thank each of you
for helping me...

40:00.951 --> 40:02.574
...through some hard times.

40:02.785 --> 40:05.195
You stuck by me when I needed you.

40:05.414 --> 40:09.032
And you've given your best
to make our ER...

40:09.251 --> 40:11.328
...a place that we can all
be proud of.

40:11.671 --> 40:14.506
So thanks for being my family.

40:14.716 --> 40:16.709
I couldn't have made it without you.

40:21.806 --> 40:22.838
Here we go!

41:00.139 --> 41:02.975
I had the Babcock on the lesser
curvature of the stomach.

41:03.184 --> 41:06.720
There's no way I could've been
near the left gastric.

41:07.022 --> 41:08.814
Any way you could've
caught the artery?

41:08.983 --> 41:11.521
No. Morgenstern was
dissecting the esophagus.

41:11.736 --> 41:14.654
My clamp was on the stomach
the entire time.

41:15.240 --> 41:17.148
Then it's your word against his.

41:18.493 --> 41:21.411
So how much did you see
on the monitor?

41:22.039 --> 41:24.660
I got there just before you
performed the thoracotomy.

41:25.500 --> 41:27.956
- In time to see me push him?
- Yeah.

41:28.921 --> 41:31.921
I'm willing to express my concern
about his competency.

41:32.090 --> 41:36.089
No, no, no. I don't want you to
jeopardize your career over this.

41:38.973 --> 41:40.967
I don't know.
Maybe my clamp did slip.

41:41.185 --> 41:44.351
You just told me you had the clamp
on the stomach the entire time.

41:46.147 --> 41:47.891
I'm sure I did.

41:48.483 --> 41:51.603
Peter, if you're sure
that's what happened...

41:54.948 --> 41:56.277
Yeah.

41:56.701 --> 41:57.981
I'm sure.

42:24.398 --> 42:26.722
The food was terrible.
The music stinks.

42:26.942 --> 42:30.477
The drinks are watered down. But you
sure know how to throw a great party.

42:30.655 --> 42:32.611
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

42:34.200 --> 42:37.237
- Are you feeling better?
- Yeah.

42:37.829 --> 42:40.829
Good. The antibiotics are working.

42:45.795 --> 42:47.753
You got a big decision to make.

42:48.799 --> 42:50.507
I told you what I want to do.

42:50.676 --> 42:52.549
I know. Just hear me out.

42:54.055 --> 42:58.266
I'm gonna love you and respect you
no matter what you decide.

42:59.226 --> 43:01.302
And I'll always be there for you.

43:03.607 --> 43:07.474
So if you want to take this chemo,
you have to do it for yourself.

43:09.363 --> 43:12.198
Not for your dad or for your sister...

43:12.699 --> 43:14.027
...or for me.

43:15.870 --> 43:18.443
- Understand?
- I think so.

43:20.500 --> 43:23.038
A man has to make decisions
for himself.

43:24.879 --> 43:26.789
I don't want any more chemo.

43:30.010 --> 43:31.469
Okay.

43:31.720 --> 43:32.883
You know what I want?

43:36.100 --> 43:38.556
I want to get in that Viper.

43:41.356 --> 43:43.846
Cobalt blue with the racing stripe.

43:45.151 --> 43:47.358
Put the top down and drive.

43:47.862 --> 43:49.356
And where would we go?

43:51.075 --> 43:52.616
California.

43:53.285 --> 43:54.614
Surfing?

43:54.912 --> 43:57.450
Ride the curl at Zuma Beach.

43:58.040 --> 43:59.915
Sounds like fun.

44:00.710 --> 44:02.667
And we'll stay for the sunset.

44:03.004 --> 44:05.154
Sure.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
