00:04.254 --> 00:06.839
Hey, Rach, listen.
Did you know that during pregnancy...

00:07.048 --> 00:11.093
...your fingers swell up to twice
their size and never go back?

00:12.762 --> 00:15.139
Oh, my God. Let me see that.

00:16.558 --> 00:18.559
You fall for it every time.

00:20.270 --> 00:23.313
Hey. Look, I brought you
my old maternity clothes.

00:23.523 --> 00:28.485
Oh, Pheebs, that's so sweet.
Oh, those are so cute.

00:28.695 --> 00:32.906
And look. See how they expand
as the baby grows?

00:33.116 --> 00:38.412
And then after the baby's born,
they're great for shoplifting melons.

00:40.457 --> 00:43.792
Oh, good, you're all here.
Okay, Thanksgiving tomorrow, 4:00.

00:44.002 --> 00:48.338
Oh. And guess who I invited? Remember
that guy Will Culvert from high school?

00:49.090 --> 00:51.300
- No.
- He was in Ross' class.

00:51.509 --> 00:56.180
Marching band, was kind of overweight.
Well, really overweight.

00:56.431 --> 00:58.015
I mean, I was his thin friend.

01:00.226 --> 01:01.935
Wow, I don't remember him.

01:02.103 --> 01:04.688
Are you sure you're not talking about
your imaginary boyfriend?

01:04.855 --> 01:07.608
No, that was Jared.

01:08.943 --> 01:12.821
Wow. Haven't thought about him
in a long time.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.076
Anyway, um, Will's here on business...

01:17.243 --> 01:19.536
...and he didn't have a place to go
so I invited him here.

01:19.746 --> 01:20.788
Oh, that's nice.

01:20.955 --> 01:22.706
Oh, by the way,
he's lost a bunch of weight.

01:22.874 --> 01:27.836
I mean, he looks good.
Okay, I mean really, really gorgeous.

01:32.383 --> 01:35.803
- I still love Chandler.
- Wouldn't hurt you to say it once in a while.

01:38.556 --> 01:41.975
Okay, also, just so you know,
I'm not gonna make a turkey this year.

01:42.602 --> 01:44.895
- What?
- Well, Phoebe doesn't eat turkey.

01:45.105 --> 01:49.566
- Phoebe.
- Turkeys are beautiful, intelligent animals.

01:49.734 --> 01:52.945
No, they're not.
They're ugly and stupid and delicious.

01:54.656 --> 01:57.658
All right, it's not just Phoebe.
Will's still on a diet...

01:57.826 --> 01:59.535
...Chandler doesn't eat
Thanksgiving food...

01:59.702 --> 02:01.745
...and Rachel's having
her aversion to poultry.

02:01.913 --> 02:02.955
She is?

02:03.123 --> 02:06.041
Yeah, remember I had to leave
the other day when you had that chicken?

02:06.209 --> 02:08.836
I thought that was just because
I put the whole thing on my hand...

02:09.002 --> 02:10.878
...and made it walk across the table.

02:12.090 --> 02:14.967
It just doesn't seem worth it to make
a whole turkey for three people.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.010
It's a lot of work.

02:17.262 --> 02:19.555
But you gotta have turkey
on Thanksgiving.

02:19.722 --> 02:24.685
I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey
is like Fourth of July with no apple pie.

02:24.853 --> 02:28.105
Or Friday with no two pizzas.

02:29.149 --> 02:32.734
All right, fine, if it means that much to you,
but there's gonna be a ton left over.

02:32.902 --> 02:35.487
No, there won't.
I promise I will finish that turkey.

02:35.697 --> 02:39.616
All right, you're telling me you can eat
almost an entire turkey in one sitting?

02:39.784 --> 02:45.789
That's right. Because I'm a Tribbiani.
This is what we do.

02:46.040 --> 02:50.002
We may not be great thinkers
or world leaders.

02:50.253 --> 02:54.965
We don't read a lot or run very fast,
but damn it, we can eat.

03:32.378 --> 03:35.047
Four wide receivers. On third and 18.

03:35.590 --> 03:38.091
Hey, isn't it weird to think about
how next year at this time...

03:38.259 --> 03:40.552
...there'll be a little baby at the table?

03:43.890 --> 03:46.099
Rachel's.
But good to know where you're at.

03:48.353 --> 03:49.645
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.813
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- You too.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.899
- Anything I can do to help?
- Actually, there is.

03:54.067 --> 03:57.194
Chandler usually helps but he's into
the game so I don't wanna bother him.

03:57.362 --> 03:59.780
- Could you help me fold these napkins?
- Sure.

03:59.948 --> 04:01.907
I'm gonna go across the hall
to check on the yams.

04:02.075 --> 04:06.286
- Okay.
- No, no, no, sweetie. No, not like that.

04:06.454 --> 04:08.747
We're not at a barn dance.

04:10.041 --> 04:13.627
You wanna fold them like swans.
Like I showed you at Christmas, remember?

04:13.795 --> 04:15.879
Yeah, it all just came
screaming back to me.

04:20.176 --> 04:23.178
- So how's the game?
- I have no idea.

04:23.346 --> 04:24.388
What?

04:24.555 --> 04:28.392
Yeah, I'm just pretending to watch the game
so I don't have to help out with stuff.

04:29.435 --> 04:33.647
I don't believe you. That is brilliant.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.651
- And Monica has no idea?
- Nope.

04:37.819 --> 04:41.196
Every once in a while
I just yell and scream stuff at the TV.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.658
Hey, what...? Hey!

04:46.619 --> 04:49.454
- Is your team winning, hon?
- Oh, yeah. Anderson just scored again.

04:50.707 --> 04:51.957
There's no Anderson.

04:54.961 --> 04:57.921
Oh, I wanna get in on this. Hey, Mon?

04:58.131 --> 05:01.591
I don't think I can't help you after all.
I didn't realize this game was on.

05:01.843 --> 05:05.095
- Oh. I didn't know you liked football.
- Well, normally, I don't.

05:05.263 --> 05:09.725
But, you know, Green Bay is playing.

05:10.268 --> 05:13.186
- You like Green Bay?
- Well, it's only like my favorite bay.

05:20.611 --> 05:22.821
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:26.200 --> 05:27.868
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Aw, thanks.

05:28.036 --> 05:31.163
God, Will, I'm so glad that you came.
You just... You look great.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.372
You must've lost like...

05:32.582 --> 05:34.082
A hundred and fifty pounds.

05:34.250 --> 05:37.210
Yeah, I'm gonna be in one of those
Subway sandwich commercials.

05:39.213 --> 05:43.592
- A pie.
- Right. Uh, it's no fat, no sugar, no dairy.

05:43.843 --> 05:47.346
- It's no good. Throw it out.
- You wanna meet some people?

05:47.597 --> 05:50.557
This is, uh, my husband, Chandler.
Chandler, this is Will.

05:50.767 --> 05:54.144
Oh, hey. I'd shake your hand but, uh,
I'm really into the game.

05:55.813 --> 05:59.691
Plus, I think it'd be better for my ego
if we didn't stand right next to each other.

06:02.528 --> 06:04.112
- This is Phoebe.
- Hi.

06:04.822 --> 06:07.657
Hey. Wow.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.371
Well done.

06:13.164 --> 06:14.581
- Wanna give me a hand?
- Sure.

06:14.749 --> 06:18.251
Monica, I can't get over how great
you look. You look stunning.

06:18.419 --> 06:23.673
- You look incredible too. You're just so fit.
- I'm watching the game but I'm not deaf.

06:24.759 --> 06:27.010
Oh, um, I meant to tell you,
Ross is coming.

06:27.178 --> 06:29.429
Ross is coming. Great, I love Ross.

06:29.597 --> 06:31.181
Well, good. And Rachel Green too.

06:32.725 --> 06:34.101
Oh.

06:35.812 --> 06:39.231
- Is there a problem?
- Nope. Uh, it's okay.

06:39.399 --> 06:40.816
It's just, uh...

06:40.983 --> 06:43.026
God, I hated her.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.779
- What?
- I hated her.

06:45.988 --> 06:48.865
She was horrible to me in high school.

06:49.450 --> 06:52.369
But hey, that was a long time ago.
I'm in a good place.

06:52.537 --> 06:55.205
It might be actually fun to see her again.

06:55.581 --> 06:58.542
Got any cakes or cookies or something?

07:00.545 --> 07:03.088
No, Will. No.

07:03.714 --> 07:06.550
You know, it's been a while since we
screamed something. Maybe we should.

07:06.717 --> 07:09.553
- Oh, okay. No!
- Oh, come on!

07:09.804 --> 07:13.098
Damn you, ref. You burn in hell!

07:17.270 --> 07:19.604
Hey, what are you doing?
You gotta save room.

07:19.772 --> 07:21.648
You've got almost an entire turkey to eat.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.817
Let me explain to you
how the human body works.

07:25.695 --> 07:28.029
I have to warm up my stomach first.

07:28.197 --> 07:32.367
- Eating chips is like stretching.
- Okay.

07:32.577 --> 07:35.912
- Don't worry, Tribbianis never get full.
- I actually know what you're talking about.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.539
And I'm here to tell you something.

07:37.707 --> 07:40.667
You can eat and eat and eat,
but nothing will ever fill that void.

07:43.796 --> 07:47.382
- Who the hell is this guy?
- This is Will, from high school.

07:47.550 --> 07:48.675
- Oh, hey.
- Hello.

07:49.844 --> 07:51.136
- Will.
- Ross.

07:51.387 --> 07:57.267
Hey, you came.
Man, you look incredible. Hot stuff.

07:58.519 --> 08:01.605
- Hot stuff?
- It's good to see you, man.

08:01.814 --> 08:04.649
Yeah, you too.
Man, so, what are you up to?

08:05.234 --> 08:09.154
- I'm a commodities broker.
- Really? That sounds interesting.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.948
- Yeah, it's not.
- Oh.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.784
- But I'm rich and thin.
- Oh, hey.

08:15.495 --> 08:20.207
Man, I don't think I've seen you since, uh,
Lance Davis' graduation party.

08:20.416 --> 08:22.167
- That was such a fun night.
- Yeah.

08:22.335 --> 08:26.630
Would've been good if we had gotten in,
but still, real fun.

08:26.839 --> 08:29.758
God, we were lame back then. Do you
remember how into dinosaurs we were?

08:34.263 --> 08:37.182
- Yeah.
- So, what do you do now?

08:39.018 --> 08:40.519
So how long are you in town?

08:42.772 --> 08:46.316
- Hi.
- Hey, sweetie. Oh, good.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.026
Rachel Green.

08:49.737 --> 08:52.489
Oh, oh, that's right.
Are you gonna be okay?

08:52.740 --> 08:58.203
Oh, I'll be fine. It's just...
God, I hate her, Ross. I hate her.

09:00.873 --> 09:03.166
Will, high school was a long time ago.

09:03.376 --> 09:06.461
Look at her standing there
with those yams.

09:06.671 --> 09:12.300
My two greatest enemies, Ross:
Rachel Green and complex carbohydrates.

09:13.678 --> 09:15.554
Oh, my God, Monica. Who is that?

09:16.847 --> 09:22.102
- That's Will, from high school.
- Ah. I do not remember him.

09:22.353 --> 09:26.064
Wow, really got that
sexy smoldering thing going on.

09:31.946 --> 09:35.699
Oh, my God. Look at the way
he's just staring at me.

09:35.866 --> 09:38.618
I think he's trying to mouth something
to me, but I can't make it out.

09:38.786 --> 09:42.539
I hate you.

09:43.457 --> 09:45.959
- Okay, dinner's ready.
- Okay.

09:46.168 --> 09:50.046
- Yeah. Solid effort. Solid effort.
- Oh, so who won?

09:50.256 --> 09:52.591
- Green Bay.
- Detroit.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.343
- What?
- Well, the Lions technically won.

09:55.595 --> 09:59.097
But it was a moral victory
for the Green Bay Mermen.

10:03.477 --> 10:05.770
- Hi. Will, right?
- Right.

10:05.938 --> 10:07.689
Right, hi. I'm Rachel Green.

10:07.898 --> 10:12.986
- Oh, I remember you.
- Really? Aren't you sweet?

10:13.195 --> 10:18.366
I gotta tell you though,
I'm having the hardest time placing you.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.994
Oh, oh, hang on. I think I remember you.

10:21.245 --> 10:26.708
Did we, um...? Did we fool around
at Lance Davis' graduation party?

10:27.376 --> 10:30.670
- You are unbelievable.
- Thank you.

10:31.589 --> 10:35.175
Uh, Rachel? Why don't you sit here?
And, Will, you sit way over there.

10:42.683 --> 10:46.186
That's it? Even if nobody helps me,
I can eat that, no problem.

10:46.395 --> 10:47.812
At least give me a challenge.

10:49.231 --> 10:51.524
This is Chandler's chicken.

10:53.277 --> 10:56.404
This is the turkey.

10:57.406 --> 11:00.533
Oh. How big is that?

11:00.743 --> 11:05.413
- About 19 pounds.
- It's like me when I was born.

11:07.083 --> 11:10.085
All right, who would, uh, like some yams?
Will?

11:10.252 --> 11:12.379
Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

11:14.006 --> 11:17.425
What? Oh, you know what?
Can we please keep the chicken...

11:17.593 --> 11:19.678
...and the turkey and everything
on the other side?

11:19.887 --> 11:23.640
- The smell is just... Yuck.
- Typical. Ahem.

11:25.476 --> 11:27.811
- I'm sorry, what?
- I said it was typical.

11:28.062 --> 11:29.396
Typical of you, Rachel Green.

11:29.563 --> 11:33.441
Queen Rachel, does whatever she wants
in her little Rachel-land.

11:38.614 --> 11:40.448
Seriously, who is this guy?

11:40.950 --> 11:44.619
Um, ahem, sorry,
do you have a problem with me?

11:44.829 --> 11:49.874
- I don't know. Do I? Do I?
- I think you do.

11:51.502 --> 11:54.254
Apparently you were a little mean to him
in high school.

11:54.463 --> 11:59.134
- A little mean? You made my life miserable.
- I had no idea. I'm sorry.

11:59.343 --> 12:03.054
Well, you should be.
Screw it. Bring on the yams.

12:03.472 --> 12:05.098
Will, but you've worked so hard.

12:05.266 --> 12:07.350
- Yams!
- Okay.

12:10.438 --> 12:15.024
Uh, Will, I just wanna say that I'm real sorry
for whatever I did to you in high school.

12:15.276 --> 12:17.277
Oh, it wasn't just me. We had a club.

12:18.404 --> 12:20.113
- You had a club?
- That's right.

12:20.281 --> 12:23.283
The "I Hate Rachel Green Club."

12:23.492 --> 12:26.578
Oh, my God. So, what,
you all just joined together to hate me?

12:26.746 --> 12:31.666
- Who else was in this club?
- Me and Ross.

12:36.172 --> 12:39.758
No need to point.
She knows who Ross is.

12:46.223 --> 12:50.894
- So you were in an "I Hate Rachel" club?
- Yes, he was.

12:51.061 --> 12:52.270
No, no.

12:54.023 --> 12:56.441
So who else was in this club?

12:56.609 --> 13:00.361
Uh, actually, there was also that
exchange student from Thailand.

13:00.529 --> 13:03.865
But I don't think he knew what it was.

13:04.408 --> 13:07.160
So, Ross, we went out for two years
and you never told me...

13:07.328 --> 13:09.078
...you were in an "I Hate Rachel Club."

13:09.246 --> 13:12.791
You went out with her? We had a pact.

13:13.042 --> 13:16.544
It was in high school.
It's not like it was binding forever.

13:16.712 --> 13:19.255
Then why did it have
the word "eternity" in it?

13:21.008 --> 13:23.843
Okay, Monica, did you know about this?

13:24.094 --> 13:25.929
I swear I didn't. Hey, is that why you guys...

13:26.096 --> 13:28.264
...used to go up to your bedroom
and lock the door?

13:28.432 --> 13:31.976
- Yeah.
- Huh. A little relieved, I gotta say.

13:33.813 --> 13:38.441
Look, Rach, I'm sorry, okay?
I was a stupid kid, okay?

13:38.609 --> 13:39.776
The only reason I joined...

13:39.944 --> 13:43.154
- Cofounded.
- Cofounded.

13:44.698 --> 13:48.201
Cofounded the club,
was that I was insanely in love with you.

13:48.410 --> 13:50.036
Obviously I didn't handle it very well...

13:50.204 --> 13:52.330
...but if you think about it,
the "I Hate Rachel Club"...

13:52.581 --> 13:54.874
...was really the "I Love Rachel Club."

13:55.042 --> 13:57.877
Uh, except that it was really
the "I Hate Rachel Club."

13:59.171 --> 14:03.466
Okay, so, what, you guys would just get
together and say mean things about me?

14:03.717 --> 14:08.054
- Well, we did a little more than that.
- No, no. No, no. No, no. Heh.

14:08.472 --> 14:09.931
What? What else did you do?

14:10.182 --> 14:12.725
- We started a rumor.
- What rumor?

14:14.603 --> 14:18.565
Oh, come on, Will.
Just take off your shirt and tell us.

14:21.902 --> 14:24.112
- Ross?
- Ugh, it was no big deal.

14:24.280 --> 14:30.577
Uh, we... We said that...
The rumor was that, um...

14:30.828 --> 14:34.747
...you had both male and female
reproductive parts.

14:34.915 --> 14:36.165
Ha!

14:37.126 --> 14:38.251
- What?
- That's right.

14:38.419 --> 14:40.211
We said your parents flipped a coin...

14:40.379 --> 14:44.257
...decided to raise you as a girl,
but you still had a hint of a penis.

14:46.302 --> 14:49.095
- Oh, my God.
- You started that?

14:49.305 --> 14:53.808
- What, you heard that?
- Everyone at our school heard it.

14:54.018 --> 14:57.312
Everybody at my school heard it.
You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader?

14:57.521 --> 14:59.480
Oh, no.

15:00.774 --> 15:02.984
Oh, my God, this is all making
so much sense to me now.

15:03.152 --> 15:05.111
This is why Adam Carter
wouldn't go out with me.

15:05.321 --> 15:08.323
This is why Billy Tratt
would just stay in this region.

15:08.574 --> 15:12.702
Actually, Billy Tratt is gay now,
so that one's not really our fault.

15:13.704 --> 15:17.498
- Monica, how come you never told me this?
- I thought it might be true.

15:17.666 --> 15:20.460
And I was afraid that you were gonna cry
and then show it to me.

15:27.760 --> 15:31.220
Joey, stop staring. There's nothing there.
It's not true.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.765
- I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.
- Oh...

15:48.739 --> 15:51.783
You are my Everest.

15:51.992 --> 15:56.371
- Joey, you don't have to finish that.
- Oh, yes, I do. Otherwise, what's next?

15:56.622 --> 15:59.290
Today I'm just a guy
who can't finish a turkey...

15:59.458 --> 16:01.834
...but tomorrow I'm the guy
who eats half a Power Bar...

16:02.086 --> 16:05.713
...wraps up the rest and puts it
in the fridge? No.

16:05.881 --> 16:10.593
I just gotta change my pants.
What was I thinking? Jeans have no give.

16:14.056 --> 16:19.143
Okay. Okay. Listen to what Sean McMahon
wrote in my yearbook senior year.

16:19.353 --> 16:24.315
"Dear Rach, you're such a great person."
Not girl, "person."

16:24.566 --> 16:27.860
Rach, I think you're reading
a little too much into it.

16:28.612 --> 16:32.490
"Dear Rach, you're a great person.
Sorry about your teeny weenie."

16:36.245 --> 16:37.412
What do you want me to do...

16:37.579 --> 16:41.082
...call everyone in the entire school
and tell them it wasn't true?

16:41.250 --> 16:43.835
- Yes.
- Could you also tell them I'm skinny now?

16:44.336 --> 16:46.921
Oh. Me too.

16:47.131 --> 16:50.675
Now, look, I'm not calling anybody, okay?
It was like a million years ago.

16:50.884 --> 16:54.721
I don't care how long ago it was.
You told people that I was half and half.

16:56.598 --> 16:58.182
You know what? I just wanna point out...

16:58.350 --> 17:00.351
...I never did anything to hurt you
in high school.

17:01.103 --> 17:02.979
That's not totally true.

17:03.230 --> 17:04.480
- What?
- What?

17:04.690 --> 17:06.983
Well, you did start that rumor
about Ross...

17:07.151 --> 17:11.069
...making out with Mrs. Altmann,
our 50-year-old librarian.

17:12.906 --> 17:15.241
How did you know that?

17:18.369 --> 17:21.789
- It's true?
- No.

17:22.040 --> 17:25.585
Yes, it is. I saw you guys going at it
behind the card catalog.

17:26.962 --> 17:29.547
Mrs. Altmann? She also made out...

17:29.715 --> 17:32.675
...with Ta-Taka-Ki-Kek the night
before he went back to Thailand.

17:34.928 --> 17:38.639
I'm sorry, when you were in high school
you made out with a 50-year-old woman?

17:38.807 --> 17:42.977
- Hey, she didn't look 50.
- Did she look 16?

17:43.228 --> 17:45.354
Oh, there's a picture of her
in the yearbook actually.

17:45.522 --> 17:46.856
Oh.

17:47.858 --> 17:51.778
- Wow.
- She didn't photograph well.

17:51.987 --> 17:54.030
She probably wasn't familiar
with the process...

17:54.198 --> 17:57.617
...having spent most of her life
sitting for oil paintings.

17:59.119 --> 18:03.831
So how did this happen?
Did she lure you to an early-bird dinner?

18:09.922 --> 18:13.841
I was working late in the library
one afternoon.

18:14.009 --> 18:15.510
It was just the two of us.

18:15.719 --> 18:18.137
She needed some help
with her word jumble.

18:20.099 --> 18:23.851
And one thing led to another.

18:24.436 --> 18:30.108
If you must know,
Anita was very gentle and tender.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.530
May she rest in peace.

18:36.907 --> 18:40.118
- Didn't she walk with a cane?
- Only when it was damp.

18:41.745 --> 18:46.457
I can't believe you told people about this.
Everybody knew?

18:46.625 --> 18:51.379
- You know what? I'm back in the club.
- Yeah!

18:51.672 --> 18:53.548
- I wanna join.
- What...? Phoebe?

18:53.799 --> 18:58.136
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I never got to be
in a club. I didn't go to high school.

18:58.387 --> 19:01.222
But three of us would meet
behind a Dumpster to learn French.

19:03.183 --> 19:06.227
All right, you know, fine,
you guys can have your stupid little club.

19:06.436 --> 19:10.898
But I would just like to say what you did
to me is way worse than what I did to you.

19:11.108 --> 19:14.569
- You gave me a teeny weenie.
- Ha, ha, yeah.

19:17.739 --> 19:20.950
All right, listen. You're just being silly.

19:21.118 --> 19:24.370
Rachel, even with that rumor you were
one of the most popular girls in school.

19:24.538 --> 19:26.330
Everyone wanted to be like you.

19:26.498 --> 19:30.251
One girl wanted to be like you so much,
she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll.

19:30.460 --> 19:32.253
Wow.

19:33.589 --> 19:35.756
And, Ross,
if it weren't for Rachel's rumor...

19:35.924 --> 19:38.593
...I mean, no one in high school
would have even known who you were.

19:38.760 --> 19:43.055
- She put you on the map.
- As a romancer of the elderly.

19:44.224 --> 19:47.435
Hey, Mrs. Altmann was the kind of woman
you could tell she used to be pretty.

19:47.644 --> 19:51.689
The eyes did still sparkle.

19:52.482 --> 19:57.069
Hey, guys, this stuff is so way in the past.
You've been through so much since then.

19:57.321 --> 20:00.489
And right now, you got so much more
important stuff going on in your lives.

20:00.657 --> 20:02.450
Can't you just let this go?

20:06.205 --> 20:07.246
She's right.

20:07.414 --> 20:09.957
Yeah, I mean,
we are having a baby together.

20:10.167 --> 20:12.084
Hold on.

20:13.378 --> 20:16.088
- You got her pregnant?
- Yeah.

20:16.548 --> 20:18.883
- Are you getting married?
- No.

20:19.092 --> 20:22.136
So you knocked her up
but you're not gonna marry her.

20:22.304 --> 20:23.804
Dude.

20:26.767 --> 20:30.019
- Anybody?
- Okay.

20:34.399 --> 20:37.068
It's exactly how I imagined it would be.

20:39.780 --> 20:42.531
All right, where's that turkey?

20:47.204 --> 20:52.541
- Joey, those are my maternity pants.
- No, these are my Thanksgiving pants.

20:59.633 --> 21:02.843
Well, that's it. I'm done.

21:03.053 --> 21:04.595
Whew.

21:05.305 --> 21:07.348
Here come the meat sweats.

21:11.812 --> 21:14.605
Well, Joey, we're all very proud of you.

21:14.815 --> 21:19.527
Yes, I believe we can expect a call
from the president any moment now.

21:19.778 --> 21:24.156
- Is there anything we can do for you?
- No, just nobody press on my stomach.

21:24.366 --> 21:25.908
You can keep those pants, by the way.

21:28.620 --> 21:32.707
What...? What do you got there?
What is that, pie?

21:32.916 --> 21:37.086
- Heh. Yeah, you want some?
- Just cut me a little sliver.

21:39.131 --> 21:41.382
A little bigger.

21:42.426 --> 21:44.093
Little bigger.

21:44.344 --> 21:46.804
What, are you afraid you're gonna run out?
Cut me a real piece.
