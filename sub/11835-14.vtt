WEBVTT

00:01.935 --> 00:04.838
DEBORAH: They told me you were
busy. Thanks for seeing me.

00:04.871 --> 00:06.339
JIMMY: It's been a long time.

00:06.372 --> 00:08.173
DEBORAH: Five years.

00:08.208 --> 00:10.110
When you left the bank,
I remember Bill saying

00:10.143 --> 00:11.878
that you got a job
in a law firm.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.748
How is Bill?
Is he okay?

00:15.281 --> 00:16.315
No.

00:16.717 --> 00:18.251
Jimmy, he's not.

00:19.753 --> 00:20.787
Please.

00:22.255 --> 00:23.790
It started slow.

00:23.824 --> 00:25.559
He would forget things.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.393
Like amnesia?

00:27.427 --> 00:29.696
No. He's delusional.

00:31.331 --> 00:32.899
Bill's schizophrenic.

00:34.968 --> 00:35.969
I'm sorry.

00:36.770 --> 00:39.272
He's been like this
for almost five years.

00:40.206 --> 00:42.943
I can't care for him
alone anymore.

00:44.578 --> 00:48.381
There's a home--
a mental institution.

00:48.414 --> 00:50.584
I put him there
two years ago.

00:51.451 --> 00:53.520
Tell me how I can help.

00:53.554 --> 00:56.957
For the most part,
he's lived there
without any problems,

00:56.990 --> 01:00.794
and then,
about eight months ago,

01:00.827 --> 01:02.596
he fell out a window.

01:02.629 --> 01:04.230
He fell out a window?

01:04.263 --> 01:05.732
On the seventh floor.

01:06.166 --> 01:07.501
Oh, my God.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.036
But he survived?
DEBORAH: Yes.

01:10.070 --> 01:13.940
A canopy on the third floor
broke his fall.

01:14.841 --> 01:18.612
That and a man
named Edward Green.

01:18.645 --> 01:19.746
Who?

01:19.780 --> 01:23.049
An accountant who happened
to be walking by the building.

01:23.083 --> 01:26.687
Bill landed on him
and killed him instantly.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.490
Bill's being sued, Jimmy.

01:30.524 --> 01:32.559
Me too.
I'm his legal guardian.

01:32.593 --> 01:37.197
Deborah, if you need a lawyer,
I'll do whatever I can.

01:39.065 --> 01:40.901
He thinks he's Superman.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.003
Excuse me?

01:43.036 --> 01:44.571
My husband...

01:45.071 --> 01:46.573
thinks that he is...

01:46.607 --> 01:47.674
Superman.

01:50.677 --> 01:52.879
I'm not sure
what to say to that.

01:52.913 --> 01:55.315
I know it sounds absurd.
But it's not.

01:55.348 --> 01:58.619
In his mind, he really
believes it, Jimmy.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.522
And what scares me--

02:01.988 --> 02:03.890
I don't think
he fell out that window.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.460
I think he was
trying to fly.

02:12.465 --> 02:16.402
(music playing)

03:01.715 --> 03:03.083
I've got a hearing
that day.

03:03.116 --> 03:04.851
So do I, and mine's
in Federal Court.

03:04.885 --> 03:07.954
We're not making child-care
decisions based on jurisdiction.

03:07.988 --> 03:11.091
Please, I need you to help me
this one time.

03:11.124 --> 03:12.726
We need to find
a new baby-sitter.

03:12.759 --> 03:14.327
I understand,
but I've got a full plate.

03:14.360 --> 03:17.197
So do I, but that never
seems to count.

03:17.230 --> 03:18.999
Meanwhile, you keep
taking on new cases.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.400
I'm being criticized
for that now?

03:20.433 --> 03:22.468
We need new cases
to keep this place running.

03:22.503 --> 03:25.405
Sometimes you need to choose
family before work.

03:25.438 --> 03:27.974
Sorry-- this sounds like
a pretty good fight,

03:28.008 --> 03:29.342
but they're all waiting.

03:32.679 --> 03:34.280
(sighs)

03:34.314 --> 03:36.449
JIMMY: The Munces
need our help.

03:36.482 --> 03:38.785
EUGENE: A lot of people
need our help, Jimmy.

03:38.819 --> 03:42.656
But I know these people.
Bill Munce was my friend.

03:42.689 --> 03:44.758
So why are they just
hiring you now?

03:44.791 --> 03:46.993
The hospital told them
they'd work out a settlement

03:47.027 --> 03:49.763
with the victim's wife,
but they couldn't make a deal,

03:49.796 --> 03:50.931
so it's going to trial.

03:50.964 --> 03:52.098
When?

03:52.899 --> 03:54.000
Two days.

03:54.034 --> 03:56.770
EUGENE: You can't just jump
into a complicated tort case

03:56.803 --> 03:57.771
on two days' notice.

03:57.804 --> 03:58.972
JIMMY: It's not complicated.

03:59.005 --> 04:01.107
Everybody agrees he's nuts,

04:01.141 --> 04:02.976
everybody agrees
he pancaked the guy.

04:03.009 --> 04:04.377
EUGENE: We're talking
about priorities--

04:04.410 --> 04:05.912
taking on new clients

04:05.946 --> 04:08.682
when you already have cases
that need your attention.

04:08.715 --> 04:11.317
It won't take that long,
I promise.

04:11.351 --> 04:14.454
Defending a wrongful-death case
means no contingency.

04:14.487 --> 04:16.822
These people got
nobody else to turn to.

04:20.493 --> 04:21.795
(sighs)

04:21.827 --> 04:23.864
One day.
That's all you get.

04:23.897 --> 04:25.999
BOBBY: If the case doesn't
settle, I want you out.

04:26.032 --> 04:27.901
That's all I ask.

04:28.468 --> 04:29.803
Now, I gotta go.

04:29.836 --> 04:31.137
Wait, Jimmy,
I'm going with you.

04:31.171 --> 04:33.339
Lindsay--
LINDSAY:
We need a baby sitter.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.375
I suggest
you start looking.

04:40.046 --> 04:42.816
Bill's been deeply
affected by this.

04:43.650 --> 04:45.719
He sees himself as Superman.

04:46.386 --> 04:48.822
Heroes don't kill
innocent people.

04:48.855 --> 04:50.256
LINDSAY: Did you tell him
we were coming?

04:50.290 --> 04:52.025
DR. BERNARD: Yes, of course.

04:52.058 --> 04:55.495
JIMMY: What should I call him,
"Bill" or "Superman"?

04:55.529 --> 04:57.564
DR. BERNARD: Normally, "Bill."

04:57.598 --> 05:00.534
We do our best here
not to indulge the delusion.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.269
When we do,
it's only to keep them calm.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.938
LINDSAY: Won't the medication
help him with that?

05:04.971 --> 05:06.272
DR. BERNARD: To some extent.

05:06.306 --> 05:09.275
But Bill's not responding
to the current drugs.

05:10.010 --> 05:11.912
I wish I could say
he's improving.

05:12.546 --> 05:13.747
But he's not.

05:13.780 --> 05:16.016
So the Bill Munce
I knew...

05:16.049 --> 05:18.685
DR. BERNARD: Is almost
completely gone, Mr. Berluti.

05:18.719 --> 05:20.386
But he's still there.

05:20.420 --> 05:22.923
He still has rare moments
of lucidity.

05:23.590 --> 05:25.091
DR. BERNARD:
You need to understand,

05:25.125 --> 05:27.360
Bill Munce is mentally ill.

05:27.393 --> 05:29.429
That means
he can be unpredictable,

05:29.462 --> 05:31.364
even unreasonable.

05:41.942 --> 05:42.909
Jimmy!

05:42.943 --> 05:44.244
Bill.

05:49.482 --> 05:50.517
I'm sorry.

05:51.752 --> 05:53.253
When they said
my friend Jimmy was here,

05:53.286 --> 05:54.855
I assumed they meant
Jimmy Olsen.

05:55.421 --> 05:56.590
BILL: Have we met?

05:57.423 --> 05:59.793
No. I don't think
we have.

05:59.826 --> 06:02.162
JIMMY: I'm Jimmy Berluti.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.630
This is Lindsay Dole.

06:04.565 --> 06:05.766
We're your lawyers.

06:06.266 --> 06:08.234
Oh, you must be here
about the accident.

06:08.268 --> 06:10.270
LINDSAY: Yes, we were hoping
to talk about that.

06:11.505 --> 06:13.574
Well, I don't know
what more I can say.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.643
It was a busy morning.

06:17.744 --> 06:19.379
And the attendants here
at times

06:19.412 --> 06:21.515
can get me a little...
distracted.

06:23.183 --> 06:25.586
I tried to fly
without my cape.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.420
Your cape?

06:27.453 --> 06:29.189
BILL: All I can say is...

06:29.656 --> 06:31.124
I made a mistake.

06:33.527 --> 06:34.995
It's just...

06:35.028 --> 06:37.263
I didn't realize
the cape was that important.

06:37.297 --> 06:38.932
Well, of course it's important.

06:38.965 --> 06:40.767
I can't fly without it.

06:41.334 --> 06:42.703
I understand.

06:43.604 --> 06:45.105
A man is dead.

06:46.306 --> 06:47.841
And it's my fault.

06:49.475 --> 06:51.745
Nothing I can do
will ever change that.

06:53.614 --> 06:55.816
I'll have to live with that
for the rest of my life.

06:57.050 --> 06:59.285
(music playing)

07:09.596 --> 07:13.066
Actually, you may
not remember me, Bill,

07:13.099 --> 07:15.201
but you and I
once knew each other.

07:16.637 --> 07:18.404
JIMMY: I didn't keep in touch.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.541
I'm sorry about that.

07:21.374 --> 07:22.743
But you and I...

07:23.276 --> 07:24.778
we were friends.

07:31.251 --> 07:32.252
I'm sorry.

07:33.453 --> 07:34.621
I don't remember.

07:36.089 --> 07:37.924
It was a long time ago.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.762
But the man I knew,

07:41.795 --> 07:44.464
he never would have meant
to hurt anyone.

07:45.265 --> 07:47.467
This was not your fault.

07:49.035 --> 07:51.437
Sometimes
bad things happen...

07:52.506 --> 07:54.140
...even to heroes.

08:02.783 --> 08:04.450
LINDSAY: Aren't you concerned
about the effects

08:04.484 --> 08:05.852
a trial might have on him?

08:05.886 --> 08:08.154
DR. BERNARD: Yes. For Bill's
sake, I'd prefer we settle.

08:08.188 --> 08:09.455
LINDSAY: So why haven't you?

08:09.489 --> 08:10.490
ALLDREDGE: We've done
everything we could,

08:10.524 --> 08:11.958
but Mrs. Green
and her lawyer

08:11.992 --> 08:13.326
are being
totally unreasonable.

08:13.359 --> 08:15.295
The woman is entitled
to something.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.797
Her husband was killed.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.633
Sure, but she's suing
for 15 million.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.167
We offered her
a million dollars.

08:21.201 --> 08:22.769
She won't settle
for less than three.

08:22.803 --> 08:25.171
JIMMY: You don't have insurance?
ALLDREDGE: Of course we do.

08:25.205 --> 08:27.440
But we're worried our carrier
will drop our coverage

08:27.473 --> 08:28.942
if we get hit for too much.

08:28.975 --> 08:31.945
If that happens,
we're finished.

08:31.978 --> 08:33.980
Patients that we've
treated for years

08:34.014 --> 08:37.551
will be thrown into state mental
institutions, if there's room.

08:37.583 --> 08:39.452
Most will end up
on the street.

08:39.485 --> 08:43.089
But if you lose at trial,
the sky's the limit on damages.

08:43.123 --> 08:45.859
And let's face it--
he jumped out of your window.

08:45.892 --> 08:47.661
You have to think
you're going to lose.

08:47.694 --> 08:50.731
Only if the jury thinks
we're to blame.

08:52.432 --> 08:55.836
Wait a minute,
you're going to blame Bill?

08:55.869 --> 08:57.804
He's insane.
You were responsible for him.

08:57.838 --> 08:59.740
We're not blaming Bill.

09:01.341 --> 09:02.509
Who, then?

09:03.510 --> 09:05.078
Talk to his wife.

09:05.111 --> 09:06.412
His wife?

09:06.446 --> 09:09.182
Ultimately, we didn't
push him out that window.

09:09.215 --> 09:10.416
She did.

09:10.450 --> 09:12.152
What are you talking about?

09:15.155 --> 09:18.792
On the day Bill fell,
his wife came to visit--

09:18.825 --> 09:21.695
to tell Bill
she was filing for divorce.

09:22.395 --> 09:25.098
ALLDREDGE: Your client wasn't
trying to fly, Mr. Berluti.

09:25.799 --> 09:27.768
He was trying
to kill himself.

09:28.368 --> 09:31.638
(music playing)

09:44.250 --> 09:45.819
JIMMY: Why didn't you tell us?

09:45.852 --> 09:47.688
DEBORAH: I'm sorry.
I didn't think they knew.

09:47.721 --> 09:48.589
Deborah--

09:48.622 --> 09:50.056
I've talked to their lawyer
a dozen times.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.158
He never said anything
about the divorce.

09:53.727 --> 09:56.062
Look, I'm not exactly
proud of myself.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.865
DEBORAH: We've been married
for almost 14 years.

09:58.899 --> 10:01.267
For the last five, I've been
watching him fall apart,

10:01.301 --> 10:03.003
praying
that he gets better.

10:03.036 --> 10:04.137
Deborah,
you don't need to--

10:04.170 --> 10:07.173
DEBORAH: I know I'm supposed to
love him, stay with him.

10:08.141 --> 10:10.076
And I swear to you both,
I have tried.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.478
But you don't know
what my life has become.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.883
Do you think
this was a suicide attempt?

10:16.917 --> 10:18.885
Is that what they're
planning on saying?

10:18.919 --> 10:20.386
Yes.

10:20.420 --> 10:22.155
You can't let them.

10:22.188 --> 10:25.125
Please, you cannot
let Bill hear that.

10:27.293 --> 10:30.196
They let the Munces think
the case would settle.

10:30.230 --> 10:31.965
There wasn't gonna be
a trial.

10:31.998 --> 10:34.100
LINDSAY: So Deborah and Bill
walk into court unprepared

10:34.134 --> 10:35.669
and get slaughtered
with the judgment.

10:35.702 --> 10:36.970
What are you gonna do now?

10:37.003 --> 10:39.072
JIMMY: Well...
EUGENE: Plan "B."

10:39.773 --> 10:41.307
REBECCA: What exactly
are you getting at?

10:41.341 --> 10:44.177
Well, Mrs. Green isn't the only
one who's been hurt by this.

10:44.210 --> 10:45.345
The Munces have, too.

10:45.378 --> 10:47.681
EUGENE: Emotional distress,
pain and suffering.

10:47.714 --> 10:50.250
Put the blame
where it belongs.

10:50.283 --> 10:51.818
So you think we should sue
the hospital?

10:51.852 --> 10:53.086
Damn right.

10:54.621 --> 10:56.489
(crying)

11:03.730 --> 11:04.965
BOBBY: Lucy, call the agency.

11:04.998 --> 11:07.133
I need to meet
with more baby-sitters.

11:15.576 --> 11:18.144
DEBORAH: Will the judge let you
do that-- sue the hospital?

11:18.178 --> 11:20.747
LINDSAY: We hope so.
It's probably our only shot
at winning.

11:20.781 --> 11:23.717
But it is dangerous.
The hospital will come
after you and Bill.

11:23.750 --> 11:25.652
I don't know
how much he can take.

11:25.686 --> 11:27.487
You need to understand,

11:27.521 --> 11:30.423
if you're found liable,
you could lose everything,

11:30.456 --> 11:32.893
including the money
to pay for his care.

11:34.294 --> 11:35.896
Okay.

11:35.929 --> 11:37.898
He's been waiting for a while.
We should go in.

11:38.999 --> 11:43.336
(music playing)

11:52.045 --> 11:53.446
Hello, Bill.

11:53.479 --> 11:55.448
(sighs)

11:55.481 --> 11:56.817
Hello, Lois.

12:02.288 --> 12:04.591
We're not going to deny
what happened.

12:04.625 --> 12:07.060
We're just going to say
you weren't to blame.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.095
BILL: Okay.

12:09.596 --> 12:10.697
JIMMY: One more thing...

12:10.731 --> 12:13.399
If we can get the judge
to go for it,

12:13.433 --> 12:15.602
we want you to wear
the Superman outfit.

12:16.537 --> 12:18.672
I saw the complaint.

12:18.705 --> 12:20.674
They name Munce,
not Superman.

12:20.707 --> 12:23.343
BILL: Munce is the one
on trial.

12:23.376 --> 12:26.613
Bill, they already know
you're Superman.

12:26.647 --> 12:30.050
Do they?
I'm not really sure.

12:30.083 --> 12:33.486
JIMMY: Believe me,
they definitely know.

12:33.520 --> 12:36.122
And having the jury see
who you are,

12:36.156 --> 12:38.859
it could help explain
to them how this happened.

12:40.126 --> 12:42.629
Really? How?

12:43.597 --> 12:46.833
Superman is an icon.
America loves you.

12:46.867 --> 12:47.534
BILL: Yes.

12:48.334 --> 12:50.904
Which is why
I won't wear the outfit.

12:50.937 --> 12:54.174
Superman is a role model.
He shouldn't be seen on trial.

12:54.207 --> 12:58.011
BILL: As a matter of fact,
now that they know
Munce is Superman,

12:58.044 --> 13:00.113
I'm gonna need your help
to change my name.

13:02.549 --> 13:05.085
JUDGE: Ms. Dole,
I don't like surprises.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.220
Filing a cross-complaint
on the day of trial

13:07.253 --> 13:08.889
constitutes a surprise.

13:08.922 --> 13:11.091
LINDSAY: Your honor, we've only
recently got on this case.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.726
JUDGE: Mr. Klein,
what does the plaintiff

13:12.759 --> 13:13.860
have to say about this?

13:13.894 --> 13:16.029
Let them point fingers
at each other,

13:16.062 --> 13:18.498
so long as my client
gets what she's entitled to.

13:18.532 --> 13:20.500
MR. KLIEN: What we don't want
is a continuance.

13:20.534 --> 13:21.868
ALLDREDGE: We need time
for discovery.

13:21.902 --> 13:23.036
LINDSAY: You've had time.

13:23.069 --> 13:24.971
They have had access
to our clients

13:25.005 --> 13:26.272
from the moment
this happened.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.074
Your Honor,
if the Munces lose,

13:28.108 --> 13:29.710
they can always
come after us later.

13:29.743 --> 13:31.144
LINDSAY: That means two trials

13:31.177 --> 13:33.346
with the same witnesses
and the same testimony.

13:33.379 --> 13:34.848
We don't need
to try this twice.

13:38.018 --> 13:39.820
Since the plaintiff
does not object

13:39.853 --> 13:42.322
and the hospital
did have ample discovery,

13:42.355 --> 13:43.890
I'll allow
the cross-complaint.

13:43.924 --> 13:46.026
JUDGE: We'll begin in an hour.
(gavel bangs)

13:46.560 --> 13:50.831
(music playing)

13:55.702 --> 13:57.403
You asked if I was worried

13:57.437 --> 13:59.405
that a trial
could devastate Bill.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.643
The better question is...
are you?

14:08.949 --> 14:10.851
You need to understand--

14:10.884 --> 14:12.819
Dr. Gorman
is a compassionate man

14:12.853 --> 14:14.988
who gets paid to care
about Bill's condition.

14:16.122 --> 14:17.390
I'm not.

14:25.799 --> 14:28.034
MR. KLEIN: How long were you
and Mr. Green married?

14:29.503 --> 14:31.972
MRS. GREEN: In August,
it would have been 23 years.

14:32.005 --> 14:33.907
You must have loved him
very much.

14:33.940 --> 14:36.476
Yes, Mr. Klein,
I loved my husband.

14:36.510 --> 14:38.512
Tell us what happened,
Mrs. Green.

14:38.545 --> 14:41.414
I met Ed for lunch
at 12:00.

14:41.447 --> 14:43.684
And when we were done,

14:43.717 --> 14:46.352
we decided to walk
a few blocks to his office.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.421
And when did you realize
that something was wrong?

14:48.454 --> 14:50.290
I slowed up for a minute

14:50.323 --> 14:52.392
to look at a dress
in one of the windows.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.528
Look, I-I don't want
to hear this.

14:54.561 --> 14:55.562
It's okay, Bill.

14:55.596 --> 14:56.897
MRS. GREEN:
And I heard a scream.

14:57.998 --> 14:59.499
MRS. GREEN: And I saw a man...

14:59.533 --> 15:01.167
that man...

15:01.935 --> 15:04.170
...lying on the sidewalk.

15:04.204 --> 15:06.406
He was wearing
a Superman costume.

15:07.207 --> 15:09.342
MR. KLEIN: And what happened
to Ed, Mrs. Green?

15:09.375 --> 15:11.645
His neck was broken.

15:13.046 --> 15:14.581
I knew he was dead.

15:15.982 --> 15:17.283
MR. KLEIN: Thank you.

15:17.884 --> 15:19.452
I have nothing further.

15:20.386 --> 15:21.588
Mr. Berluti?

15:23.456 --> 15:24.490
Mr. Alldredge?

15:28.494 --> 15:30.931
ALLDREDGE: Your husband
was an accountant?

15:30.964 --> 15:32.132
MRS. GREEN: Yes.

15:32.165 --> 15:35.168
An accountant
who earned $45,000 a year?

15:35.201 --> 15:36.302
So?

15:36.336 --> 15:39.706
So you're suing
for $15 million in damages.

15:39.740 --> 15:42.208
ALLDREDGE: The truth is,
Mrs. Green,

15:42.242 --> 15:44.845
your husband
was 53 years old.

15:44.878 --> 15:46.813
It would have taken him
over 300 years

15:46.847 --> 15:48.048
to earn
that kind of money.

15:48.081 --> 15:50.216
My husband was killed,
Mr. Alldredge.

15:50.250 --> 15:53.319
Yes, because that woman chose
to be reckless.
JIMMY: Objection.

15:53.353 --> 15:55.355
You don't really believe
we're to blame for his death?

15:55.388 --> 15:57.057
Objection!
Overruled.

15:57.090 --> 15:59.192
This isn't right.
I don't like this.
Bill.

15:59.225 --> 16:00.727
ALLDREDGE: She didn't care
about ending her own marriage.

16:00.761 --> 16:02.629
Do you think she cares
about ending yours?

16:02.663 --> 16:05.065
MRS. GREEN: I don't know who
is to blame, Mr. Alldredge.

16:05.098 --> 16:06.633
All I do know...

16:06.667 --> 16:09.269
is that
my husband is dead.

16:10.671 --> 16:14.174
And no amount of money
can make that right.

16:14.841 --> 16:19.713
(music playing)

16:29.455 --> 16:31.792
Bill's never tried
to fly before.

16:31.825 --> 16:34.160
He never discussed
the ability to fly.

16:34.194 --> 16:36.863
Flying is just not
part of his pathology.

16:36.897 --> 16:39.499
ALLDREDGE: Did Mr. Munce appear
suicidal before that day?

16:39.533 --> 16:41.602
No. If he had,
we would have lodged him

16:41.635 --> 16:42.903
on a more secure floor.

16:42.936 --> 16:45.706
Then why do you think
this was a suicide attempt?

16:45.739 --> 16:48.408
DR. BERNARD:
To understand, you need to know
about Bill's condition.

16:48.441 --> 16:51.645
Has his condition improved
since being at the hospital?

16:51.678 --> 16:55.481
No. About all we can do
is keep him safe and calm.

16:55.516 --> 16:57.951
That means keeping stress
to an absolute minimum.

16:57.984 --> 16:59.385
ALLDREDGE: Why?

16:59.419 --> 17:01.855
DR. BERNARD: It triggers
inappropriate behavior.

17:01.888 --> 17:04.590
I think stress made him
try to end his life.

17:04.625 --> 17:07.426
ALLDREDGE: What stress are you
referring to?

17:07.460 --> 17:10.195
Bill's wife, Deborah, visited
on the day in question.

17:10.230 --> 17:12.165
DR. BERNARD: I met her
at the reception desk

17:12.198 --> 17:14.500
and walked her
into a private room.

17:14.535 --> 17:15.602
About ten minutes later,

17:15.636 --> 17:18.638
I walked by that room
and saw Bill alone, crying.

17:18.672 --> 17:20.473
Did you ask him
what was wrong?

17:20.507 --> 17:22.643
Yes, but he wouldn't say.

17:23.676 --> 17:25.045
I got him calmed down,

17:25.078 --> 17:26.713
then I went to get
his medication.

17:28.013 --> 17:30.483
It was then that Bill
jumped out the window.

17:31.752 --> 17:33.787
JIMMY: He dresses
like Superman.

17:33.820 --> 17:36.156
He calls his wife "Lois,"

17:36.189 --> 17:38.024
but you didn't think
he might try to fly?

17:38.058 --> 17:39.860
What happened
had nothing to do

17:39.893 --> 17:41.862
with his assumption
of Superman's identity.

17:41.895 --> 17:43.830
So, he's lying when he said
he tried to fly?

17:43.864 --> 17:45.999
At some level,
I'm sure he believes it.

17:46.032 --> 17:48.535
DR. BERNARD: But that's just
a defense mechanism.

17:48.569 --> 17:51.838
Bill Munce heard his wife
say she was leaving him.

17:51.872 --> 17:54.941
Bill Munce tried to kill
himself, not Superman.

17:54.975 --> 17:56.977
And you being the doctor--
you must know

17:57.010 --> 17:59.913
exactly what reality he's in
at any given moment.

17:59.946 --> 18:00.914
DR. BERNARD: I know he's ill.

18:00.947 --> 18:02.348
He needs a safe place,

18:02.382 --> 18:04.751
which we provided him
until his wife destroyed it.

18:04.785 --> 18:06.452
Move to strike--
nonresponsive.

18:06.486 --> 18:08.722
Sustained.
The jury will disregard.

18:08.755 --> 18:12.158
As director of the hospital,
you treat patients

18:12.192 --> 18:13.760
and make staffing decisions.

18:13.794 --> 18:14.861
Yes.

18:14.895 --> 18:17.497
Doctor, isn't it a fact
that last year

18:17.531 --> 18:19.700
your hospital was bought
by a parent company?

18:19.733 --> 18:23.570
Yes, but--
And less than three months
after you were bought,

18:23.604 --> 18:26.272
you reduced your staff
by almost 30 percent?

18:26.306 --> 18:29.543
The company chose
to streamline our costs.

18:29.576 --> 18:31.745
The reduction hasn't proven
a danger to anyone.

18:31.778 --> 18:32.879
Tell Ed Green that.

18:32.913 --> 18:35.148
ALLDREDGE: Objection!
JIMMY: Withdrawn.

18:35.716 --> 18:37.918
There were no bars
on the windows,
were there, doctor?

18:37.951 --> 18:40.453
No.
Because bars cost money.

18:40.486 --> 18:43.056
They also intimidate
and frighten the patients.

18:43.089 --> 18:45.325
That's worse than letting them
fall out a window?

18:45.358 --> 18:48.028
I told you, before that day,
he wasn't suicidal.

18:48.061 --> 18:50.697
Did you ask Mrs. Munce
why she was there that day?

18:50.731 --> 18:54.500
Well, no.
JIMMY: If you were so concerned

18:54.535 --> 18:56.970
about Mr. Munce's
fragile psyche,

18:57.003 --> 18:59.773
why didn't you ask her
why she was there?

18:59.806 --> 19:01.708
Because I thought Mrs. Munce

19:01.742 --> 19:04.545
cared about her husband's
mental health.

19:04.578 --> 19:08.448
It never occurred to me
that she would behave
so recklessly.

19:08.815 --> 19:12.819
(music playing)

19:19.760 --> 19:20.927
WOMAN: I love kids.

19:20.961 --> 19:23.830
I have six of my own.
LUCY: Six?

19:23.864 --> 19:25.632
They're older than you.

19:25.666 --> 19:27.500
Are you two planning
to have more?

19:27.534 --> 19:28.802
Oh, no, no, no,
we're not--

19:28.835 --> 19:30.904
Ever been accused
of misconduct with a child?

19:30.937 --> 19:33.239
No, of course not.

19:33.273 --> 19:34.240
Have you ever
been arrested?

19:34.741 --> 19:36.009
LUCY: Bobby.
WOMAN: No!

19:36.042 --> 19:37.611
Any problems with drugs
or alcohol?

19:37.644 --> 19:39.613
Wait just a minute.

19:39.646 --> 19:41.982
The agency told me
you were nice people.

19:42.015 --> 19:44.150
Sorry, this is new for me.

19:44.184 --> 19:46.019
Before I hire someone
to take care of my son,

19:46.052 --> 19:47.521
I like to be
sure about them.

19:48.555 --> 19:49.990
Well, I understand.

19:50.023 --> 19:52.425
I do have
excellent references.

19:52.458 --> 19:54.995
I see only
two families listed.

19:55.028 --> 19:58.965
I was with those people for
over 10 years without a problem.

19:58.999 --> 20:00.166
What about an AIDS test?

20:00.200 --> 20:01.101
LUCY: What?

20:01.134 --> 20:02.002
WOMAN: An AIDS test?

20:02.569 --> 20:05.438
No, I have not had
an AIDS test.

20:05.471 --> 20:07.407
Exactly how old are you?

20:07.440 --> 20:08.975
I tell you what--

20:09.009 --> 20:10.977
I am old enough to know
I don't need this.

20:12.813 --> 20:14.881
Good luck staying married
to this pig!

20:16.149 --> 20:19.019
(door opens and slams)

20:21.054 --> 20:22.022
BOBBY: Hmm.

20:23.223 --> 20:24.290
What?

20:26.259 --> 20:29.262
DEBORAH: I lost him the day
he forgot my name.

20:29.295 --> 20:31.497
He started calling me "Lois."

20:31.532 --> 20:33.900
LINDSAY: Why did you place
him at Clerendon Hall?

20:33.934 --> 20:36.970
DEBORAH: I kept him at home
as long as I could.

20:37.003 --> 20:40.641
Please understand, I'm still
in love with the man I married.

20:40.674 --> 20:44.277
It's just-- Bill isn't
that man anymore.

20:44.811 --> 20:46.513
I've lost my husband.

20:46.547 --> 20:48.582
Tell us why you went
to see him that day.

20:48.615 --> 20:51.484
I went to tell Bill
I was asking for a divorce.

20:51.518 --> 20:54.020
Was that really something
that he needed to hear?

20:54.054 --> 20:57.257
Yes. We'd been together
a long time.

20:57.290 --> 20:59.560
It's something he deserved
to hear from me.

20:59.593 --> 21:01.895
And how did he react
when you told him about it?

21:01.928 --> 21:05.265
At first he was
confused and upset.

21:06.166 --> 21:08.835
He said that Superman and Lois
could never be apart.

21:09.736 --> 21:12.873
But by the time I left,
he seemed okay.

21:15.742 --> 21:18.378
This wasn't the first time you
considered a divorce, was it?

21:18.411 --> 21:19.913
That's not true.

21:19.946 --> 21:22.215
You didn't want to be married
to a mid-level banker.

21:22.616 --> 21:24.985
You resented Bill
for his lack of ambition.

21:25.018 --> 21:25.986
Objection, Your Honor.

21:26.019 --> 21:28.121
This is what Bill Munce
told his therapist

21:28.154 --> 21:29.756
the first year he got
to the hospital.

21:29.790 --> 21:32.693
That's privileged.
We can use his statements
to defend ourselves.

21:32.726 --> 21:34.127
He's right, Ms. Dole.

21:34.160 --> 21:36.496
By suing the hospital,
you waived the privilege.

21:36.530 --> 21:39.666
I loved my husband,
Mr. Alldredge.

21:39.700 --> 21:41.467
Then why did you make him
so miserable?

21:41.868 --> 21:44.237
He said you called him
weak, stupid.

21:44.270 --> 21:46.139
Bill would never
have said that.

21:46.172 --> 21:48.374
Your husband chose
to be Superman.

21:48.408 --> 21:51.044
In his mind, he had to be
perfect to make you happy.

21:51.077 --> 21:52.412
Objection-- argumentative.

21:52.445 --> 21:53.547
Sustained.

21:53.580 --> 21:55.481
ALLDREDGE: This past year,
Mrs. Munce,

21:55.516 --> 21:57.984
how many times did you
visit your husband?

21:59.753 --> 22:01.287
BILL: She came when she could.

22:01.321 --> 22:03.056
JIMMY: Bill, please.

22:03.089 --> 22:04.257
ALLDREDGE: Mrs. Munce?

22:04.925 --> 22:06.126
I don't know.

22:06.159 --> 22:07.427
Nine times.

22:08.294 --> 22:11.031
Nine times, Mrs. Munce.

22:11.598 --> 22:13.934
You can't even make it there
one day a month.

22:13.967 --> 22:16.102
It's hard for me
to see him like this.

22:16.136 --> 22:17.971
Stop him from hurting Lois.

22:18.004 --> 22:19.973
Why didn't you talk
to his doctor first?

22:20.006 --> 22:22.275
Excuse me?
ALLDREDGE:
You're his legal guardian.

22:22.308 --> 22:24.110
You were filing for divorce.

22:24.144 --> 22:26.713
You had to know Bill
might get upset.

22:26.747 --> 22:28.281
Why not ask for his doctor's
permission?

22:28.314 --> 22:31.484
I don't need permission
to speak with my husband.

22:31.518 --> 22:33.887
Your husband, Mrs. Munce,
is mentally ill.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.556
ALLDREDGE:
You're going to leave him,

22:35.589 --> 22:37.691
and you don't tell
his doctor ahead of time?

22:37.724 --> 22:38.424
Objection!

22:38.458 --> 22:39.660
Stop it!

22:39.693 --> 22:42.462
None of this has anything
to do with truth or justice!

22:42.495 --> 22:44.965
JIMMY: Bill--
JUDGE: Mr. Munce,
sit down right now.

22:44.998 --> 22:47.000
She doesn't have
to worry about me.

22:47.033 --> 22:48.569
I'm Superman!

22:48.602 --> 22:50.270
Counsel, sit him down now,

22:50.303 --> 22:52.739
or he's out of here faster
than a speeding bullet.

22:53.574 --> 22:54.708
JIMMY: Please!

22:55.075 --> 22:59.379
(music playing)

23:12.392 --> 23:14.360
I will testify.

23:14.394 --> 23:16.963
We can talk about that,
but you need to sit down.

23:16.997 --> 23:19.199
Attacking Lois like that--

23:19.232 --> 23:21.568
BILL: We can't let them
get away with it.

23:21.602 --> 23:23.136
DEBORAH: I don't think
he should testify.

23:23.169 --> 23:24.337
LINDSAY: I don't like it either,

23:24.370 --> 23:26.640
but you didn't do
so well up there.

23:26.673 --> 23:28.308
It's risky, I know,

23:28.341 --> 23:30.143
but I think we need him
to say this wasn't your fault.

23:31.344 --> 23:34.380
Bill, are you sure
you want to testify?

23:34.414 --> 23:36.282
You're damn right!

23:37.217 --> 23:39.452
Those sons of bitches!

23:41.755 --> 23:46.860
(music playing)

23:58.438 --> 23:59.573
I'm sorry.

24:01.241 --> 24:02.509
I, um...

24:04.210 --> 24:05.846
I don't know why I just...

24:09.916 --> 24:11.652
I'm going to protect Lois.

24:13.820 --> 24:15.388
I'm going to testify.

24:18.925 --> 24:21.327
ALLDREDGE: He can't testify.
He's crazy.

24:21.361 --> 24:23.196
JIMMY: He's a named
defendant.

24:23.229 --> 24:24.865
He has to be allowed
to take the stand.

24:24.898 --> 24:25.766
ALLDREDGE: Not if he's
incompetent.

24:25.799 --> 24:28.234
They say his wife
caused him to jump.

24:28.268 --> 24:30.403
He's got the right
to explain that she didn't.

24:30.436 --> 24:33.073
ALLDREDGE: He has no sense of
reality, of the truth--

24:33.106 --> 24:35.709
JIMMY: He can explain what was
going through his mind.

24:35.742 --> 24:38.779
That's completely relevant
to the question of liability.

24:42.082 --> 24:45.586
I hope Mr. Berluti realizes
that if his client testifies,

24:45.619 --> 24:47.521
I'm gonna treat him
like any other witness.

24:47.554 --> 24:48.789
Meaning what?

24:48.822 --> 24:51.057
I'll have to choice
but to go after him.

24:51.091 --> 24:52.859
The man is not well.

24:52.893 --> 24:55.228
You've made him watch everyone
he's trusted turn on him--

24:55.261 --> 24:57.531
his wife, his doctor.

24:57.564 --> 24:59.600
What are you trying to do,
totally destroy him?

24:59.633 --> 25:01.502
Is he threatening
my witness?

25:01.535 --> 25:03.403
No, he's warning you.

25:03.436 --> 25:04.738
And so am I.

25:05.438 --> 25:08.108
Are you sure you want
to do this, Mr. Berluti?

25:08.775 --> 25:11.512
Look, if we lose--

25:11.545 --> 25:14.047
if the jury hits the Munces
with real damages--

25:14.080 --> 25:16.149
they won't be able
to afford private care.

25:17.183 --> 25:18.819
JIMMY: Bill will spend
the rest of his life

25:18.852 --> 25:20.453
in a state institution

25:20.486 --> 25:23.657
and feel responsible
for bankrupting his wife.

25:23.690 --> 25:25.325
We can't let that happen.

25:28.128 --> 25:30.430
I'll let him testify,
Mr. Berluti.

25:30.463 --> 25:32.566
But I hope you know
what you're doing.

25:36.302 --> 25:39.072
Flying isn't something
I just do.

25:39.105 --> 25:40.774
There has to be a reason.

25:40.807 --> 25:42.308
JIMMY: So, you've flown before?

25:42.342 --> 25:44.410
Many, many times.

25:44.945 --> 25:47.480
JIMMY: Why did you want
to fly that day?

25:47.514 --> 25:49.449
Well, Lois had come
to see me--

25:49.482 --> 25:51.284
JIMMY: Sorry. Who's Lois?

25:51.317 --> 25:52.986
BILL: The woman seated there.

25:53.019 --> 25:54.655
My wife.

25:55.021 --> 25:57.257
JIMMY: Why do you think
she came to see you?

25:57.290 --> 25:59.760
She said she wanted
a divorce.

26:00.460 --> 26:03.296
But I think
she wanted my help.

26:03.329 --> 26:06.667
I think she was
in some kind of danger.

26:06.700 --> 26:08.969
JIMMY: What kind of danger?

26:09.002 --> 26:10.637
I don't really know.

26:10.671 --> 26:14.007
When she left,
I watched her
from the window.

26:14.040 --> 26:15.842
And I was gonna
follow her from above

26:15.876 --> 26:17.644
to make sure
she was all right.

26:17.678 --> 26:18.979
But that nurse--

26:19.012 --> 26:22.215
she started harping on me
about going down to lunch.

26:24.217 --> 26:25.686
I forgot my cape.

26:26.787 --> 26:28.488
I need the cape to fly.

26:29.189 --> 26:32.826
So, you weren't trying
to hurt yourself.

26:32.859 --> 26:34.861
You were just trying to fly?

26:34.895 --> 26:36.196
That's right.

26:36.663 --> 26:37.831
Thank you.

26:38.264 --> 26:39.533
JIMMY: Nothing further.

26:47.574 --> 26:50.844
ALLDREDGE: Mr. Munce,
you love your wife.

26:50.877 --> 26:52.178
Very much.

26:52.212 --> 26:54.014
ALLDREDGE: So, when she told you
she was leaving you,

26:54.047 --> 26:56.216
that was devastating,
wasn't it?

26:57.050 --> 26:58.351
No.

26:58.384 --> 26:59.586
Weren't you crying?

27:00.320 --> 27:02.122
BILL: At first, maybe...

27:02.155 --> 27:05.726
and then I calmed down.

27:05.759 --> 27:06.927
ALLDREDGE: When?

27:06.960 --> 27:10.531
Dr. Gorman said he found you
crying ten minutes later.

27:10.564 --> 27:11.965
ALLDREDGE: Alone.

27:12.498 --> 27:14.300
ALLDREDGE: You do remember that,
don't you?

27:18.705 --> 27:20.073
Mr. Munce?

27:21.041 --> 27:22.475
I, um...

27:23.143 --> 27:24.477
I remember.

27:24.911 --> 27:26.713
Did she say why
she was leaving?

27:26.747 --> 27:28.649
Objection-- irrelevant.

27:28.682 --> 27:29.950
Goes to his state of mind.

27:30.717 --> 27:31.852
Overruled.

27:32.485 --> 27:35.121
Did she say
why she was leaving?

27:35.756 --> 27:37.023
Not really.

27:37.057 --> 27:38.391
ALLDREDGE: Not really?

27:38.424 --> 27:40.961
Didn't she tell you
exactly why?

27:42.162 --> 27:44.931
Isn't it a fact
that your wife told you

27:44.965 --> 27:46.432
she had met someone else--

27:46.466 --> 27:48.602
a man she met at work?

27:49.936 --> 27:50.737
What?

27:51.738 --> 27:53.740
O-objection--
lacks foundation.

27:53.774 --> 27:56.076
I can lay the foundation.
I've got photos.

27:56.109 --> 27:58.612
Objection.
Overruled.

27:58.645 --> 28:01.014
JUDGE: Mr. Munce, do you
remember the question?

28:02.348 --> 28:04.017
She didn't say that.

28:05.786 --> 28:08.221
I don't know what
he's talking about.

28:08.254 --> 28:11.792
Mr. Munce, you tried to kill
yourself, didn't you?

28:11.825 --> 28:13.694
No, I--
ALLDREDGE: Your wife told you

28:13.727 --> 28:15.796
that she had fallen in love
with another man,

28:15.829 --> 28:17.363
and you tried
to kill yourself.

28:17.397 --> 28:19.132
ALLDREDGE: Isn't that right?

28:19.165 --> 28:20.834
BILL: I don't know what
he's talking about.

28:20.867 --> 28:22.669
I don't know what
he's talking about.

28:22.703 --> 28:24.505
BILL: I don't--
I don't know--

28:24.538 --> 28:26.172
I don't know--
I don't--

28:26.206 --> 28:28.609
I don't-- I don't know
what he's talking about.

28:28.642 --> 28:29.676
I don't know.

28:31.177 --> 28:33.547
I don't know.
I don't-- I-I-I--

28:33.580 --> 28:36.216
(quietly) No, I-I don't know
what he's talking about.

28:37.417 --> 28:39.385
BILL: I don't--
I know that Lois--

28:39.419 --> 28:42.022
She would not tell me
anything like that.

28:42.055 --> 28:43.857
She wouldn't say
that she was seeing someone.

28:43.890 --> 28:44.558
I don't know...

28:44.591 --> 28:47.027
(music playing)

28:58.905 --> 29:01.942
(people chattering)

29:03.977 --> 29:05.045
(sighs)

29:08.048 --> 29:09.015
DEBORAH: How is he?

29:09.049 --> 29:11.652
JIMMY: I don't know.
He won't talk to anyone.

29:11.685 --> 29:12.919
Can I see him?

29:12.953 --> 29:14.888
I don't think that's
a good idea.

29:14.921 --> 29:18.992
Jimmy, what they said about
me meeting somebody else--

29:19.025 --> 29:21.027
You have to believe me--
I never told him.

29:21.061 --> 29:23.296
That's not the reason
I want the divorce.

29:23.329 --> 29:24.497
JIMMY: I understand, Deborah,

29:24.531 --> 29:27.000
and I know you were trying
to protect him.

29:27.033 --> 29:29.503
JIMMY: But hiding the truth--

29:29.536 --> 29:32.005
He shouldn't have heard it
for the first time in court,

29:32.038 --> 29:33.707
and I shouldn't have, either.

29:37.243 --> 29:39.045
I-I got to get ready
for my closing.

29:43.216 --> 29:44.851
(sighs)

29:45.886 --> 29:46.687
I'm sorry.

29:47.253 --> 29:49.556
Jimmy gets nervous
before his closings.

29:50.390 --> 29:51.725
No. He's right.

29:53.393 --> 29:55.228
DEBORAH: The truth is, Lindsay,

29:55.261 --> 29:57.463
I've never known
what's best for Bill.

29:59.900 --> 30:02.435
I mean, I know I'm not
responsible for his disease.

30:03.269 --> 30:04.470
Not really.

30:06.439 --> 30:08.341
But that lawyer--

30:08.374 --> 30:10.176
He was right
about one thing--

30:11.845 --> 30:14.214
I never appreciated
what we had.

30:16.617 --> 30:19.119
DEBORAH: I kept pushing him
to be what I wanted--

30:19.986 --> 30:21.855
what I thought
he could become.

30:24.257 --> 30:25.659
I don't think
I ever accepted him

30:25.692 --> 30:27.460
simply for who he really was.

30:30.997 --> 30:32.232
I should've.

30:43.143 --> 30:48.281
MR. KLEIN: In the law,
we have a doctrine called
res ipsa loquitur.

30:48.314 --> 30:51.518
"The thing speaks for itself."

30:51.985 --> 30:56.422
Sometimes negligence
is so obvious, so blatant,

30:56.456 --> 30:59.526
the law simply shifts
the burden to the defense.

30:59.560 --> 31:01.795
"We know someone
was at fault for this,

31:01.828 --> 31:04.565
so explain to us
why it shouldn't be you?"

31:05.566 --> 31:08.501
MR. KLEIN: Here we have two
defendants at fault--

31:08.535 --> 31:12.573
a wife who drove her husband
to attempt suicide

31:12.606 --> 31:16.309
and an institution that failed
to control its patient.

31:16.342 --> 31:19.780
Who's more to blame?
That's your decision.

31:19.813 --> 31:23.850
MR. KLEIN: But there was
negligence here.

31:23.884 --> 31:25.686
Mentally ill men in costumes

31:25.719 --> 31:28.088
don't just drop
on an accountant's head.

31:29.690 --> 31:31.958
JIMMY: He's convinced
that he's Superman,

31:31.992 --> 31:35.195
but they never expected
he might try to fly?

31:36.262 --> 31:39.600
Ed Green would be alive if there
were bars on those windows.

31:39.633 --> 31:41.768
JIMMY: It really is that simple.

31:42.468 --> 31:44.437
You have to ask yourself,

31:44.470 --> 31:48.308
"Who was in the best position
to prevent what happened?"

31:48.341 --> 31:50.410
They were in control,

31:50.443 --> 31:52.913
they were responsible
for keeping him safe.

31:52.946 --> 31:55.516
JIMMY: That's what they
were being paid to do.

31:55.549 --> 32:00.420
The fact is, Clerendon Hall
isn't really a hospital.

32:00.453 --> 32:01.822
It's a business.

32:01.855 --> 32:05.025
These people care about profits,
not patients.

32:05.058 --> 32:08.061
JIMMY: And that's why they
didn't have bars on the windows.

32:08.094 --> 32:11.064
That's why they didn't have
more staff on that floor.

32:11.598 --> 32:15.468
Dr. Gorman saw Bill Munce
crying in his room.

32:15.501 --> 32:17.838
If anyone had stayed
in that room,

32:17.871 --> 32:20.240
Ed Green would still be alive.

32:21.407 --> 32:25.245
JIMMY: If they really think
he tried to kill himself,

32:25.278 --> 32:28.749
imagine the cruelty
of revealing to him

32:28.782 --> 32:31.317
that his wife is seeing
another man

32:31.351 --> 32:33.086
right here in open court.

32:33.887 --> 32:36.322
JIMMY: Now, I don't know much
Latin, Mr. Klein,

32:36.356 --> 32:40.260
but that's a thing
that speaks for itself.

32:45.031 --> 32:49.035
ALLDREDGE: When Deborah Munce
told her husband
she was leaving him,

32:49.069 --> 32:51.171
it was reckless cruelty.

32:51.872 --> 32:53.974
She drove him out that window.

32:54.007 --> 32:58.712
ALLDREDGE: Had she told
Dr. Gorman--
and she had the chance--

32:58.745 --> 33:00.881
he would have protected Bill.

33:02.583 --> 33:04.350
She didn't do it.

33:04.384 --> 33:07.954
That's the negligence
that cost Ed Green his life.

33:07.988 --> 33:11.592
ALLDREDGE: Our hospital has
taken good care of Bill Munce.

33:11.625 --> 33:13.259
For almost five years,

33:13.293 --> 33:16.496
long after his wife stopped
coming to visit,

33:16.530 --> 33:18.398
Dr. Gorman and his staff

33:18.431 --> 33:20.300
have provided
round-the-clock treatment.

33:21.234 --> 33:22.869
ALLDREDGE: Don't blame us

33:22.903 --> 33:24.505
for the actions of a wife

33:24.538 --> 33:26.973
who parked her sick husband
at our doorstep

33:27.007 --> 33:29.042
and then stopped caring for him.

33:29.075 --> 33:33.780
ALLDREDGE: Don't blame us for
her neglect and cruelty.

33:34.948 --> 33:36.517
We're a hospital.

33:36.550 --> 33:39.620
We're in the business
of caring for people.

33:39.653 --> 33:42.055
But for Mrs. Munce,

33:42.088 --> 33:44.691
this tragedy
would never have happened.

33:53.299 --> 33:55.001
LINDSAY: Bobby, what are you
doing here?

33:55.035 --> 33:55.702
Is it over?

33:55.736 --> 33:56.903
Jimmy's with the Munces.

33:56.937 --> 33:57.938
We're still waiting
for a verdict.

33:57.971 --> 34:00.607
What do you think?
LINDSAY: I don't know.

34:00.641 --> 34:02.609
An innocent man was killed.

34:02.643 --> 34:04.444
The jury's gonna want to
blame somebody for that.

34:04.477 --> 34:08.649
I, uh, thought
you might need this.

34:09.683 --> 34:10.684
What is it?

34:10.717 --> 34:13.219
Mental hospitals
from around the country.

34:13.253 --> 34:14.286
I made a few calls.

34:14.320 --> 34:16.657
A few?
There are 15 names here.

34:16.690 --> 34:19.458
The underlined ones
might be able to take Bill
when this is over.

34:19.492 --> 34:21.828
The two with the stars by them
are your best shots.

34:23.029 --> 34:24.531
This must have
taken you hours.

34:24.565 --> 34:26.166
And with all the work
that you've got...

34:27.801 --> 34:28.635
Why'd you do it?

34:28.668 --> 34:32.906
To be honest, um,
I don't know.

34:32.938 --> 34:34.808
Let's just say
I fell for the guy.

34:36.342 --> 34:38.143
There but for
the grace of God.

34:38.812 --> 34:39.980
Something like that.

34:42.047 --> 34:44.885
By the way,
I think we've got
a new baby-sitter.

34:44.918 --> 34:47.020
You're kidding.
You managed to hire one?

34:47.053 --> 34:51.224
No, uh, Eugene and Ellenor
did the interviewing.

34:51.891 --> 34:53.226
She seems very nice.

34:54.561 --> 34:55.996
You still get the credit.

34:56.996 --> 34:57.864
Thank you.

35:00.500 --> 35:02.035
I better get back
to the office.

35:04.437 --> 35:05.438
Bobby...

35:18.084 --> 35:19.185
I just...

35:21.421 --> 35:23.690
Well, I'll see you later.

35:26.927 --> 35:27.594
BOBBY: Okay.

35:32.465 --> 35:34.300
BAILIFF:
Ms. Dole, the jury's back.

35:38.471 --> 35:42.543
(music playing)

36:05.331 --> 36:07.801
Madam Foreperson,
the jury has reached a verdict?

36:07.834 --> 36:09.469
We have, Your Honor.

36:09.503 --> 36:10.737
What say you?

36:10.771 --> 36:12.438
On question one,

36:12.472 --> 36:15.976
FOREPERSON: "Do we find the
defendant, William Munce,
negligent?"

36:16.009 --> 36:18.278
We the jury answer, "No."

36:18.311 --> 36:20.146
On question two,

36:20.180 --> 36:23.917
"Do we find the defendant,
Deborah Munce, negligent?"

36:23.950 --> 36:26.452
We the jury answer, "yes."

36:26.486 --> 36:27.988
(spectators murmuring)

36:28.021 --> 36:30.456
Quiet.
I said quiet!

36:34.460 --> 36:36.830
Madame Foreperson, do you have
a verdict on question three?

36:36.863 --> 36:39.533
Yes, Your Honor.
Question three--

36:39.566 --> 36:42.669
"Do we find the defendant,
Clerendon Hall, negligent?"

36:43.469 --> 36:46.072
We the jury answer, "yes."

36:48.108 --> 36:51.812
FOREPERSON: We further order
that Clerendon Hall pay
damages to the plaintiff

36:51.845 --> 36:54.014
in the amount of three
million dollars

36:54.047 --> 36:57.618
and that Deborah Munce
pay damages to the plaintiff

36:57.651 --> 37:00.320
in the amount of one dollar.

37:03.023 --> 37:05.191
FOREPERSON: Excuse me.
We're not done.

37:06.693 --> 37:07.894
Question four--

37:07.928 --> 37:12.165
as to the cross-complaint,
we find for the complainants

37:12.198 --> 37:15.401
and order the hospital
to pay Bill and Deborah Munce

37:15.435 --> 37:18.505
actual damages of one dollar

37:18.539 --> 37:21.675
and to pay Bill Munce
punitive damages

37:21.708 --> 37:24.711
in the amount
of one million dollars.

37:27.714 --> 37:30.416
Your Honor, we move for judgment
notwithstanding the verdict

37:30.450 --> 37:32.586
and ask that the damage award
be set aside.

37:32.619 --> 37:33.854
Motion denied.

37:34.655 --> 37:36.823
JUDGE: Members of the jury,
this completes your service.

37:36.857 --> 37:38.258
You are dismissed
with my thanks.

37:38.291 --> 37:39.893
This court is adjourned.

37:40.927 --> 37:43.329
(indistinct conversations)

37:43.363 --> 37:46.399
DEBORAH: You did it, Jimmy.
Thank you so much.

37:48.535 --> 37:50.203
ALLDREDGE: We'll appeal
until this judgment--

37:50.236 --> 37:51.538
(gasping)

37:51.572 --> 37:52.573
ALLDREDGE: Are you all right?

37:54.307 --> 37:55.642
LINDSAY: Somebody get a doctor!

37:57.377 --> 37:59.212
(gasping)

37:59.245 --> 38:00.280
Somebody get a doctor!

38:05.051 --> 38:07.487
ALLDREDGE: Are you all right?
What is it? Can you breathe?

38:18.932 --> 38:21.367
BILL: I'm flying to the hospital
to get this man a doctor!

38:22.669 --> 38:24.070
JIMMY: No! Wait!
DEBORAH: Bill, no!

38:24.104 --> 38:25.138
(people screaming)

38:29.275 --> 38:30.276
JIMMY: Oh!

38:36.750 --> 38:38.184
(breathing heavily)

38:38.218 --> 38:39.786
(sighs)

38:40.320 --> 38:44.024
(music playing)

38:50.631 --> 38:52.398
He was having
a heart attack.

38:52.432 --> 38:53.634
JIMMY: It was a
panic attack Bill,

38:53.667 --> 38:56.570
some minor chest pains
caused by stress.

38:56.603 --> 38:59.706
Bill, now that this is over,
we need to talk.

38:59.740 --> 39:00.974
(knock on door)

39:03.677 --> 39:04.678
May I come in?

39:05.145 --> 39:06.346
LINDSAY: This is a client
meeting.

39:07.514 --> 39:08.348
Come on, Bill.

39:08.381 --> 39:09.683
What are you doing?

39:09.716 --> 39:11.652
Taking Bill back
to the hospital.

39:12.418 --> 39:14.655
DR. BERNARD: The lawyer says our
appeal should take a year.

39:14.688 --> 39:16.356
Whatever you may think,
Mr. Berluti,

39:16.389 --> 39:17.824
I'm still his doctor.

39:18.258 --> 39:20.093
Bill tried to save my life.

39:21.361 --> 39:24.230
So as long as we remain open,
he's gonna have a home.

39:29.469 --> 39:31.171
LINDSAY: You don't have to go
with him, Bill.

39:31.204 --> 39:33.607
There are other hospitals
that might take you in.

39:37.110 --> 39:40.080
Is it okay to talk
to Lois for a second?

39:40.113 --> 39:41.882
I don't think that
would be a good idea.

39:41.915 --> 39:44.918
No. Wait.
It's-- it's all right.

39:55.796 --> 39:57.664
I want to come home.

39:58.264 --> 39:59.399
I know.

40:00.300 --> 40:01.568
But you can't.

40:03.504 --> 40:05.238
You don't love me anymore.

40:05.271 --> 40:06.439
That's not true.

40:07.908 --> 40:10.376
I just can't take care
of you anymore.

40:12.846 --> 40:16.717
Whatever you did--
if you met someone else,

40:16.750 --> 40:19.052
I don't care about that.

40:19.820 --> 40:21.522
All that matters to me

40:21.555 --> 40:22.689
is that we stay together.

40:25.391 --> 40:27.127
I can't do this again.

40:27.628 --> 40:28.829
I'm sorry.

40:33.199 --> 40:34.367
Deborah...

40:39.640 --> 40:42.175
I'll use whatever name
you want.

40:42.208 --> 40:43.777
Bill...

40:43.810 --> 40:45.111
Listen to me.

40:47.080 --> 40:49.182
I won't be Superman anymore.

40:51.552 --> 40:53.687
I promise.
I-- I can do it.

40:54.655 --> 40:56.122
You can't.

40:58.358 --> 41:00.627
DEBORAH: The world needs
Superman.

41:01.194 --> 41:02.696
Especially now.

41:04.364 --> 41:06.900
And no matter how much
I might want to...

41:08.168 --> 41:11.171
...I can't ask you to stop
being who you really are.

41:14.474 --> 41:15.842
I love you.

41:17.477 --> 41:19.112
I love you, too.

41:23.950 --> 41:25.118
Goodbye.

41:28.555 --> 41:30.123
(sobs)

41:31.357 --> 41:32.626
I...

41:32.659 --> 41:34.027
(sobs)

41:34.060 --> 41:36.096
...wanna go home.

41:43.637 --> 41:45.506
(crying)

41:46.239 --> 41:50.511
(music playing)

41:58.952 --> 42:03.657
(music playing)

42:25.145 --> 42:26.146
WOMAN: You Stinker!
