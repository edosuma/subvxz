00:01.835 --> 00:03.076
NARRATOR: Tonight
on <i>Beyond Oak Island...</i>

00:03.169 --> 00:04.995
Where are we searching today?

00:05.079 --> 00:07.923
GARY: This area in Florida
is the Treasure Coast,

00:08.082 --> 00:13.336
where the fabled
Spanish 1715 Fleet sunk,

00:13.430 --> 00:16.089
and so we could find anything.

00:16.174 --> 00:18.517
JOHN B.: When the
ships hit the reefs in 1715,

00:18.676 --> 00:21.094
they hit the reefs
and literally exploded.

00:21.187 --> 00:25.182
There's still over 20 tons
of silver coins to be recovered.

00:25.275 --> 00:28.027
There's plenty of treasure
to be found.

00:28.186 --> 00:29.945
MATTY: Oh, wow, yeah,
it's in here somewhere, Rick.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.281
- Wow.
- That's a signal, mate.

00:32.440 --> 00:34.533
- (laughing): Whoa!
- Come on.

00:36.786 --> 00:38.454
All the while
we were growing up,

00:38.538 --> 00:41.623
my brother and I were fascinated
with finding treasure.

00:42.876 --> 00:43.709
RICK:
Pirate treasure,

00:43.793 --> 00:45.368
cursed treasure.

00:45.453 --> 00:47.379
Civil War gold.

00:47.464 --> 00:50.290
- (laughter) - Since then,
our work on Oak Island

00:50.374 --> 00:52.542
has shown us
there's a world of mysteries...

00:52.635 --> 00:55.545
- Whoa.
- Waiting to be explored.

00:55.630 --> 00:58.381
RICK: So, we like to reach
out to other treasure hunters.

00:58.466 --> 01:00.801
X marks the spot, right there.
Brilliant.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.895
- MARTY: We want to hear their stories...
- That's right.

01:03.054 --> 01:05.472
- And share our insights.
- "Ill-gotten gains."

01:05.556 --> 01:06.973
- RICK: And who knows...
- GARY: I got it.

01:07.058 --> 01:08.650
Maybe we can help them
with their search.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.310
MARTY:
Not only in America.

01:10.403 --> 01:12.071
Wow. That is gold.

01:12.230 --> 01:13.980
- RICK: But all over the world.
- Yeah!

01:14.074 --> 01:15.657
MARTY:
<i>Beyond Oak Island.</i>

01:25.585 --> 01:27.836
MARTY: This little
excursion of ours to see Gary

01:27.921 --> 01:29.746
and learn about what
his world is all about

01:29.839 --> 01:32.257
and the treasure
he's sought for so long--

01:32.416 --> 01:34.584
We're gonna just have
a little fun on the beach.

01:34.669 --> 01:36.595
We're gonna do
a little metal detecting.

01:36.754 --> 01:39.089
We're gonna learn a little bit.
I'm pretty excited about it.

01:39.182 --> 01:41.424
I'm very much looking forward
to understanding

01:41.518 --> 01:44.511
more about the Treasure Coast
and its history.

01:44.595 --> 01:46.021
NARRATOR:
In Sebastian, Florida,

01:46.180 --> 01:48.440
brothers Rick and Marty Lagina,

01:48.599 --> 01:50.776
along with Matty Blake,
are heading to the home

01:50.935 --> 01:54.446
of their good friend and key
member of their Oak Island team,

01:54.531 --> 01:57.533
world-renowned metal detection
expert Gary Drayton.

01:57.617 --> 01:59.109
We're gonna get
to see his finds.

01:59.193 --> 02:00.193
- Yes!
- That's right.

02:00.286 --> 02:01.444
Well, that's another
great thing. Yes.

02:01.538 --> 02:03.455
NARRATOR:
During the winter months,

02:03.614 --> 02:05.374
when he's not helping
the Laginas on Oak Island,

02:05.533 --> 02:09.536
Gary, who happens to live on
Florida's famed Treasure Coast,

02:09.620 --> 02:12.038
keeps busy with
his own personal quest:

02:12.132 --> 02:14.216
searching for the lost riches

02:14.375 --> 02:17.294
of the 1715
Spanish Treasure Fleet.

02:18.129 --> 02:20.881
You know, we were talking about

02:20.974 --> 02:24.384
the colonial powers, you know,
plundering the Americas.

02:24.468 --> 02:27.563
These guys
and the people in charge,

02:27.722 --> 02:29.398
they wanted gold, of course,

02:29.557 --> 02:32.142
and, you know, um,
they wanted glory.

02:32.235 --> 02:34.153
- Right.
- Uh, they wanted glory for Spain.

02:34.237 --> 02:35.988
Exactly. I agree with you.

02:38.482 --> 02:42.828
NARRATOR: In 1492, shortly
after Christopher Columbus sailed

02:42.987 --> 02:44.237
to what would become
the Americas

02:44.330 --> 02:47.082
on behalf of the Spanish Empire,

02:47.167 --> 02:50.169
he and his crew were astonished
to find gold deposits

02:50.253 --> 02:54.173
scattered throughout the rivers
across the island of Hispaniola.

02:55.258 --> 02:58.919
Lured by the promise that more
great riches might be found,

02:59.012 --> 03:02.505
Spain began an aggressive
campaign to colonize Central

03:02.590 --> 03:06.435
and South America, as well as
the Caribbean Islands.

03:07.020 --> 03:11.514
In 1519, the notorious
conquistador, Hernán Cortés,

03:11.608 --> 03:13.775
led his army
on a ground expedition

03:13.935 --> 03:16.445
into what is today Mexico City,

03:16.604 --> 03:19.773
where he encountered
the Aztec Empire

03:19.866 --> 03:24.703
and their vast wealth of gold,
silver and precious jewels.

03:24.787 --> 03:27.956
It would lead to a brutal
conquest that would only trigger

03:28.041 --> 03:30.533
even more violent plundering
of the region

03:30.627 --> 03:32.535
and ultimately the destruction

03:32.629 --> 03:35.038
of numerous
indigenous civilizations.

03:35.131 --> 03:37.791
ROB W.:
Cortés goes into Mexico City,

03:37.884 --> 03:40.794
finds the Aztec Empire's
huge amounts of wealth.

03:40.887 --> 03:44.389
By 1536, the Spanish have
completely conquered the Aztecs.

03:45.633 --> 03:48.718
A little bit later,
Pizarro goes down into Peru,

03:48.803 --> 03:50.470
where he finds the Inca Empire,

03:50.554 --> 03:52.889
another huge
pre-Columbian empire

03:52.982 --> 03:55.558
with lots of riches,
lots of gold.

03:56.644 --> 03:59.154
And they start sending gold
and more silver

03:59.313 --> 04:02.148
back to Spain, and in a very,
very short period of time,

04:02.233 --> 04:06.820
Spain becomes one of the world's
premier superpowers.

04:08.155 --> 04:10.999
NARRATOR: Over the course
of the next three centuries,

04:11.084 --> 04:13.752
other European nations,
including England,

04:13.911 --> 04:16.830
France and Portugal,
joined the race for control

04:16.914 --> 04:20.083
of New World territories,
plundering, by some estimates,

04:20.176 --> 04:23.845
more than $500 billion
in treasure,

04:23.930 --> 04:25.755
which was loaded
onto galleon ships

04:25.840 --> 04:28.258
to be sailed back home
to their monarchs.

04:29.343 --> 04:32.437
However, for many of
these European conquerors,

04:32.596 --> 04:34.356
there was one obstacle
that they would not

04:34.440 --> 04:37.267
be able to overcome
on their journey home:

04:37.360 --> 04:39.102
the ocean.

04:39.195 --> 04:40.862
JOHN D.: The ocean was not
a safe place to be,

04:40.947 --> 04:43.273
especially for a Spanish fleet

04:43.357 --> 04:47.110
going back
to the Old World with riches.

04:47.203 --> 04:49.946
They feared
being caught by storm,

04:50.039 --> 04:54.534
by hurricanes,
by a number of elements.

04:54.627 --> 04:58.038
NARRATOR: Although experts
and historians can only estimate,

04:58.131 --> 05:02.134
it is believed that more
than 681 treasure vessels

05:02.293 --> 05:05.211
lay in ruins below
the waters spanning from Cuba

05:05.305 --> 05:08.640
to the Eastern Seaboard
of the modern-day United States.

05:09.467 --> 05:11.810
MARTY: Here we are,
Gary Drayton's house.

05:11.969 --> 05:13.636
MATTY:
Sweet pad.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.731
- RICK: War room Florida.
- MATTY and MARTY: Yeah.

05:15.815 --> 05:18.892
MARTY: I am looking forward to
seeing what the Draymeister has.

05:18.985 --> 05:22.237
RICK: I'm always about the eyes
and boots guys on Oak Island.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.481
You know, Gary certainly is
an eyes and boots guy.

05:24.565 --> 05:26.066
There he is. I see him.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.492
Hey, Gary Drayton!

05:27.577 --> 05:29.319
RICK: It's exciting to know
that we're finally gonna

05:29.412 --> 05:31.580
get to see Gary in his element

05:31.664 --> 05:33.907
and I get to go metal detecting
on the Treasure Coast.

05:33.991 --> 05:35.825
So, it doesn't get
any better than that.

05:35.910 --> 05:37.494
- Thanks for having us.
- Come on in, guys.

05:37.587 --> 05:39.421
On my way.

05:39.580 --> 05:41.831
- Watch your head.
- Yeah, right?

05:41.916 --> 05:44.417
NARRATOR: With over
three decades of experience

05:44.510 --> 05:47.837
as a metal detection expert and
professional treasure hunter,

05:47.930 --> 05:50.599
Gary Drayton has recovered
countless artifacts

05:50.683 --> 05:52.768
from across the world,

05:52.852 --> 05:56.262
including many of great
historical and monetary value.

05:56.356 --> 05:59.691
He first found his passion
for treasure hunting

05:59.850 --> 06:03.278
as a young boy growing up
in Lincolnshire, England.

06:03.437 --> 06:05.781
GARY:
I always worked on farms,

06:05.865 --> 06:07.774
so I was always
out in the fields,

06:07.858 --> 06:11.694
and I'd be picking up little
pieces of pottery and glass.

06:11.779 --> 06:14.447
And it was like picking up
a little piece of history.

06:14.540 --> 06:17.709
When you're holding
Roman pottery in your hand

06:17.794 --> 06:20.796
and you're, like,
an 11-, 12-year-old boy,

06:20.955 --> 06:24.207
your imagination runs wild.

06:24.300 --> 06:26.793
So, Gary, you grew up
in England.

06:26.886 --> 06:28.545
Did you ever think
that a kid from England would be

06:28.638 --> 06:30.630
searching for treasure
here in Florida?

06:30.723 --> 06:33.133
Not in my wildest dreams, Matty.

06:33.217 --> 06:36.386
But just like you guys,

06:36.470 --> 06:39.639
I dreamt as a kid
of faraway treasures,

06:39.732 --> 06:42.651
uh, islands and pirates,

06:42.735 --> 06:45.487
and now I actually get
to do this for a living.

06:45.646 --> 06:47.572
It is absolutely fantastic.

06:47.657 --> 06:49.065
Is there anything
you can show us

06:49.150 --> 06:50.325
to really get our juices going?

06:50.484 --> 06:52.569
Yeah, there's something
very precious in there.

06:52.653 --> 06:54.162
- I would love that. I-I want to see the goodies.
- Oh, oh!

06:54.247 --> 06:55.655
- That's what we wanted.
- Okay.

06:55.748 --> 06:56.823
You want to see some good stuff?

06:56.907 --> 06:58.158
Yep.

06:58.242 --> 06:59.501
GARY:
The Treasure Coast, to me,

06:59.660 --> 07:03.580
is my own Oak Island
in me backyard.

07:03.673 --> 07:07.759
And one particular fleet
put this area on the map,

07:07.918 --> 07:12.505
and that is the fabled
Spanish 1715 Fleet.

07:12.598 --> 07:14.257
All right. Here we go.

07:14.350 --> 07:16.435
- I see some shinys in here.
- Oh, wow. Oh, wow.

07:16.594 --> 07:20.939
All these are interesting finds
from the 1715 Fleet.

07:21.098 --> 07:22.524
- These are nice.
- MARTY: Yeah, that's very nice.

07:22.683 --> 07:23.766
RICK:
Beautiful.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.777
- This...
- That thing is...

07:25.936 --> 07:28.521
GARY: That is a 1715
Fleet treasure ring.

07:28.614 --> 07:30.773
I know it's squashed.

07:30.858 --> 07:32.701
- I found it like that.
- MARTY: God, that's beautiful.

07:32.785 --> 07:34.119
- RICK: Mm-hmm.
- GARY: Yeah.

07:35.538 --> 07:39.958
NARRATOR: In 1715, nearly
two centuries after conquistadors

07:40.117 --> 07:42.377
first began their conquest
of the New World,

07:42.536 --> 07:45.038
Spain had fallen
into severe debt

07:45.122 --> 07:47.299
under King Philip V

07:47.383 --> 07:51.720
following the brutal 13-year
War of Spanish Succession.

07:51.879 --> 07:53.630
In a desperate bid to renew

07:53.723 --> 07:55.557
the country's
financial stability,

07:55.716 --> 07:57.467
King Philip issued an order

07:57.551 --> 07:59.478
to his forces stationed
in the New World

07:59.562 --> 08:02.981
to send an entire treasure fleet
of galleons home,

08:03.140 --> 08:05.567
loaded with as much
plundered riches

08:05.651 --> 08:07.402
as they could possibly carry.

08:09.313 --> 08:14.743
On July 24, 1715,
12 ships loaded with treasure

08:14.902 --> 08:17.070
left the port city of Havana

08:17.154 --> 08:20.990
under the command of
General Juan Esteban of Ubilla.

08:21.083 --> 08:24.494
The Gulf Stream was
the way to go.

08:24.578 --> 08:27.747
They followed the Gulf Stream
all the way up Florida

08:27.840 --> 08:31.343
because it was much faster,
all the way up to Bermuda,

08:31.427 --> 08:36.681
and then cut
toward the east to Spain.

08:36.766 --> 08:38.508
You know,
there's no Weather Channel.

08:38.592 --> 08:41.520
These guys have no idea
that a hurricane is

08:41.604 --> 08:44.347
200 miles away and heading
right in their direction.

08:45.516 --> 08:48.026
The winds have continued
to increase in velocity.

08:48.185 --> 08:50.695
It's raining.
It's torrential rain.

08:50.780 --> 08:53.189
It gets so dark at noon
that the captain's ordered

08:53.282 --> 08:55.358
that the stern lanterns be lit

08:55.442 --> 08:58.036
so the ships can continue
to follow one another.

08:59.038 --> 09:01.289
Every ship is at
the mercy of the sea.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.950
And one by one,
they get smashed to pieces

09:04.043 --> 09:06.211
against the reefs of Florida.

09:07.547 --> 09:10.966
NARRATOR: In the early
hours of Wednesday, July 31,

09:11.050 --> 09:14.886
11 of the fleet's 12 ships
were destroyed.

09:14.971 --> 09:19.465
As a result, over 700 sailors
and passengers perished,

09:19.559 --> 09:21.476
and billions of dollars' worth

09:21.635 --> 09:24.387
of gold, silver
and precious jewels

09:24.480 --> 09:26.147
were scattered
across an estimated

09:26.307 --> 09:29.309
30-mile-long stretch
of coastal reefs

09:29.402 --> 09:33.071
in the area of what is now
Vero Beach, Florida.

09:33.155 --> 09:36.741
And there was one treasure
that was on these ships

09:36.826 --> 09:42.330
that stands out from the rest,
and that is the queen's jewels.

09:42.489 --> 09:46.167
The legendary dowry
of Queen Isabel.

09:48.579 --> 09:50.913
So, Gary, this is fantastic.

09:50.998 --> 09:53.508
Absolutely fantastic.
But I know there is "the one."

09:53.667 --> 09:55.510
- Is that here?
- Oh, yeah.

09:55.669 --> 09:56.595
(chuckling):
Can we see that?

09:56.754 --> 09:58.263
- You want to see the precious?
- Yeah.

09:58.422 --> 09:59.505
- Okay, we'll get to the precious.
- All right.

09:59.599 --> 10:00.923
We're ready for the precious.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.434
This is your
pride and joy, right?

10:02.593 --> 10:03.768
Yeah, it is.

10:10.109 --> 10:12.444
- There you go.
- RICK: Whoa.

10:13.529 --> 10:16.197
Whoa. Wow.

10:16.282 --> 10:18.450
GARY:
My most impressive find

10:18.609 --> 10:22.203
on the Treasure Coast
of Florida is me precious.

10:22.363 --> 10:26.199
That magnificent 1715 Fleet

10:26.292 --> 10:28.460
emerald treasure ring.

10:28.619 --> 10:32.380
The greatest treasure ring
ever found in America,

10:32.539 --> 10:34.382
and I'm quite proud of that.

10:35.551 --> 10:36.709
That is spectacular, Gary.

10:36.794 --> 10:38.711
That is the ultimate
bobby-dazzler, innit?

10:38.804 --> 10:40.963
Yeah, it-it is.

10:41.048 --> 10:42.974
GARY: Uh, these are
flawless Colombian emeralds.

10:43.059 --> 10:44.801
300 years old.

10:44.894 --> 10:47.136
22-and-a-half-karat Inca gold.

10:47.221 --> 10:48.229
- Wow.
- Yeah.

10:48.389 --> 10:50.565
The mystery of the 1715 Fleet--

10:50.650 --> 10:54.235
And that's what drives every guy
metal detecting on the beach--

10:54.320 --> 10:58.648
Is the chance to find
the queen's jewels.

10:58.741 --> 11:01.067
MARTY: You think this
is one of them, then?

11:01.151 --> 11:05.071
I do believe
my treasure ring is part

11:05.164 --> 11:07.073
of Queen Isabel's dowry.

11:07.157 --> 11:08.324
Wow.

11:08.417 --> 11:10.585
Do we have a chance today
to actually find

11:10.744 --> 11:11.994
- something like this?
- GARY: We do.

11:12.088 --> 11:14.247
- Really? Truthfully?
- Yep, truthfully.

11:14.331 --> 11:16.925
We always got
a chance to find treasure.

11:17.009 --> 11:19.427
Because a couple of
hurricanes every year

11:19.512 --> 11:22.004
just pushing that treasure
onto the beach.

11:22.089 --> 11:25.508
Those beaches are just
full of treasure.

11:25.592 --> 11:27.602
All right. So, where
are we searching today?

11:27.687 --> 11:30.355
X actually really does
mark the spot, mate.

11:30.514 --> 11:33.599
We are going
to the site of the<i> Capitana.</i>

11:33.684 --> 11:36.361
- MARTY: Okay.
- GARY: It's called Corrigan's.

11:36.445 --> 11:39.614
It is the most heavily hunted
and the most famous

11:39.699 --> 11:43.192
of the 1715 Fleet wreck sites,

11:43.285 --> 11:45.194
because it was the biggest ship.

11:45.279 --> 11:47.038
Bigger the ship,
the bigger the treasure.

11:47.123 --> 11:49.374
- Okay. Let's go.
- Let's go.

11:49.533 --> 11:51.835
- MATTY: Let's find some stuff.
- GARY: Absolutely.

11:55.881 --> 11:57.632
MATTY: All right, we got
the treasure hunting gear.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.625
- We're ready to find some treasure.
- GARY: Let's make it happen.

11:59.719 --> 12:02.220
- It's gonna be fun.
- It's gonna be more than fun.

12:02.304 --> 12:03.304
- I mean...
- (laughs)

12:03.464 --> 12:04.889
It's like
a college road trip, right?

12:05.048 --> 12:06.048
- Yeah, there you go.
- MATTY (laughing): Yeah.

12:06.133 --> 12:07.392
NARRATOR:
In Vero Beach,

12:07.476 --> 12:09.969
along Florida's
famed Treasure coast,

12:10.062 --> 12:13.732
brothers Rick and Marty Lagina,
along with Matty Blake,

12:13.816 --> 12:16.317
are traveling to a location
with Gary Drayton

12:16.402 --> 12:18.486
where he has
previously discovered

12:18.571 --> 12:21.573
hundreds of thousands of
dollars' worth of gold, silver

12:21.732 --> 12:24.066
and jeweled artifacts
from the historic

12:24.151 --> 12:28.163
Spanish shipwrecks known
as the 1715 Treasure Fleet.

12:28.247 --> 12:32.000
The 1715 Treasure Fleet
goes down,

12:32.159 --> 12:33.743
this horrible disaster.

12:33.827 --> 12:36.662
How quickly after
it disappeared, basically,

12:36.747 --> 12:38.831
did they start to try
to salvage that treasure?

12:38.916 --> 12:40.842
Well, straightaway,
they tried to salvage

12:40.926 --> 12:42.594
as much as they could.

12:42.678 --> 12:46.005
Then the Spanish,
when word got back to Spain

12:46.089 --> 12:47.840
about these wrecks,

12:47.933 --> 12:52.771
they did a big salvage operation
for three or four years.

12:54.523 --> 12:59.101
NARRATOR: The survivors of
the wrecked 1715 Fleet established

12:59.186 --> 13:02.271
several salvage camps
in the vicinity of Vero Beach

13:02.356 --> 13:04.699
and quickly began recovering
what they could

13:04.784 --> 13:07.860
by forcing enslaved
free divers to descend

13:07.945 --> 13:10.112
for several minutes at a time

13:10.197 --> 13:14.209
to depths of as much as 45 feet
by simply holding their breath.

13:15.452 --> 13:18.463
These were either
Native American people

13:18.547 --> 13:20.957
or they were
Black African slaves.

13:21.041 --> 13:24.135
Basically, they would go out
to the wreck sites,

13:24.294 --> 13:27.222
grab a heavy rock,
jump overboard,

13:27.306 --> 13:29.766
go down and try to recover
as much as what you could find.

13:32.144 --> 13:36.064
NARRATOR: By 1719,
after many harrowing efforts,

13:36.148 --> 13:39.225
approximately 70%
of the recorded treasure

13:39.309 --> 13:42.570
was salvaged, before further
efforts had to be abandoned.

13:42.655 --> 13:46.482
However, the lost treasure
that remained on the ocean floor

13:46.567 --> 13:49.485
is estimated to be
worth billions today.

13:50.663 --> 13:54.574
And then everything
sort of like got lost in time,

13:54.658 --> 13:57.827
and it just fell into history

13:57.920 --> 14:01.005
until an enterprising guy,
Kip Wagner,

14:01.164 --> 14:06.085
he was instrumental
in the first modern

14:06.169 --> 14:09.848
salvage attempt on
the Treasure Coast of Florida.

14:11.258 --> 14:13.092
NARRATOR:
In the 1950s,

14:13.176 --> 14:14.927
a building contractor
turned treasure hunter

14:15.020 --> 14:16.679
named Kip Wagner

14:16.763 --> 14:19.765
assembled a team known
as the Real Eight Company

14:19.850 --> 14:23.444
and discovered one of
the 1715 Fleet wrecks,

14:23.529 --> 14:26.781
along with 2,000 silver coins.

14:26.866 --> 14:30.860
However, in 1964,
after partnering

14:30.944 --> 14:34.280
with professional diver
and treasure hunter Mel Fisher,

14:34.373 --> 14:37.709
the fortunes of both men
would drastically change.

14:38.869 --> 14:43.706
In 1964, they dug
a point of excavation,

14:43.790 --> 14:46.467
and the bottom was
literally paved with gold--

14:46.552 --> 14:48.219
Gold doubloons
and pieces of eight,

14:48.304 --> 14:49.712
all kinds of treasure.

14:49.805 --> 14:52.965
They brought up over a thousand
gold coins in that one day.

14:53.058 --> 14:55.885
TAFFI: Back then, I
think they were selling

14:55.978 --> 15:00.139
gold doubloons
for a thousand dollars.

15:00.223 --> 15:02.475
Today, famous gold doubloons
can be valued

15:02.568 --> 15:04.569
up to $100,000 per coin.

15:05.729 --> 15:07.238
We have a whole museum
in Sebastian, Florida,

15:07.397 --> 15:10.733
filled with our family's
personal collection,

15:10.826 --> 15:14.579
treasures from the 1715 Fleet

15:14.738 --> 15:17.332
and from some of
the other shipwrecks

15:17.416 --> 15:20.835
that my parents worked,
like the<i> Atocha</i> and<i> Margarita.</i>

15:20.994 --> 15:22.828
My father's legacy, uh,

15:22.922 --> 15:27.008
as far as the 1715 Fleet goes,
is he was a pioneer,

15:27.167 --> 15:31.754
and he showed that you were able
to succeed in finding treasure,

15:31.847 --> 15:33.765
but you had to have persistence.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.592
MARTY:
Here we are.

15:36.685 --> 15:38.427
- All right.
- MATTY: All right.

15:38.512 --> 15:40.262
Come on, fellas.
This is what we came here for.

15:40.347 --> 15:42.023
MARTY:
This is what we came here for.

15:42.182 --> 15:43.599
You know the old adage,

15:43.692 --> 15:46.194
"You can't win the lottery if
you don't buy a ticket," right?

15:46.278 --> 15:47.528
We know
the treasure's out there.

15:47.688 --> 15:49.614
We have our secret weapon,

15:49.773 --> 15:51.783
Gary Drayton,
who knows where to go.

15:51.942 --> 15:54.777
GARY: We've got two
detectors, two scoops.

15:54.870 --> 15:57.956
MARTY: I think we have a reasonable
chance of finding some treasure.

15:58.115 --> 15:59.782
I'd be really happy
with a silver coin.

15:59.866 --> 16:01.784
Yeah, obviously,
a gold coin would be fabulous.

16:01.868 --> 16:03.544
A silver coin--
I'd settle for that.

16:03.704 --> 16:06.214
And are we doing teams?

16:06.298 --> 16:08.791
I think that's the best way
is to split up into teams,

16:08.875 --> 16:11.043
- and then one dig, one detect.
- Okay.

16:11.128 --> 16:13.295
What are the teams? You pick.

16:13.380 --> 16:16.132
- Uh, Bravo Tango One...
- (laughter)

16:16.216 --> 16:18.217
- Bravo Tango Two.
- Oh, sure.

16:18.301 --> 16:20.553
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

16:20.646 --> 16:22.480
Rick gets the best
metal detector in the world?

16:22.639 --> 16:25.483
- RICK: No, no, the... No.
- And I get Matty?

16:25.567 --> 16:27.819
- (laughter)
- We're like underdogs.

16:27.978 --> 16:29.320
- So we're-we're set to win.
- All right.

16:29.405 --> 16:31.155
You know what, I agree.
Underdogs win.

16:31.314 --> 16:32.481
- All right, let's go.
- MARTY: Let's go.

16:32.566 --> 16:34.117
- Let's go before it starts raining.
- Yeah.

16:36.578 --> 16:38.821
This is it, guys--
Treasure central.

16:38.905 --> 16:41.332
- MATTY: Wow.
- MARTY: I can tell you are getting excited, Gary.

16:41.417 --> 16:42.834
- I can feel it.
- MATTY: This is cool.

16:45.746 --> 16:50.249
MATTY: Is this where that initial
1715 salvage attempt took place?

16:50.342 --> 16:54.420
Yeah. This is the area
where the<i> Capitana</i> bit the dust

16:54.504 --> 16:58.090
on that night July 31, 1715.

16:58.175 --> 17:01.510
And so, we could find
anything on this beach

17:01.595 --> 17:05.014
from way past
the condos down there

17:05.098 --> 17:09.861
to the second flagpole
to the south.

17:10.020 --> 17:12.772
There's a big,
long area where you really

17:12.865 --> 17:16.609
could find anything any day
on the Treasure Coast.

17:16.702 --> 17:19.111
I'm going to show you
where to do what I refer to

17:19.204 --> 17:21.164
as paint in the sand.

17:22.958 --> 17:26.452
And when I detect,
I sweep twice.

17:26.536 --> 17:28.788
- MARTY: Oh, I see.
- GARY: And then I step.

17:28.872 --> 17:30.623
- I never walk.
- MATTY: Okay.

17:30.716 --> 17:33.885
Now, anybody else comes
down here with a metal detector,

17:34.044 --> 17:37.379
most guys are walking
right over treasure.

17:37.464 --> 17:39.223
We're not going to do that.

17:39.382 --> 17:42.051
The hardest thing is
knowing where to search,

17:42.135 --> 17:43.969
and then you just
got to take your time

17:44.054 --> 17:46.064
and winkle a good find there.

17:46.148 --> 17:48.641
- So remember, guys, paint the sand.
- MARTY: Got it.

17:48.734 --> 17:51.227
All right, show us where
to start. We want to dig.

17:51.311 --> 17:52.978
- MATTY: Let's do it.
- GARY: Let's go.

17:53.063 --> 17:55.323
Okay, guys, this is
a great area to start,

17:55.407 --> 17:58.484
because we've got a shell line

17:58.568 --> 18:02.997
and we've got hardpack sand
on the lower beach.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.916
So, this is a good sign,
but the most...

18:05.075 --> 18:08.577
the best sign
that I'm seeing now is this.

18:08.662 --> 18:11.005
- MARTY: It's hardpack...
- Hardpack sand.

18:11.090 --> 18:14.500
This hardpack sand traps targets

18:14.593 --> 18:16.594
and holds them in place.

18:16.753 --> 18:19.514
So I think we should
split up: two teams.

18:19.673 --> 18:21.841
One go for the shell line,

18:21.925 --> 18:24.435
which is going to be
shallow surface finds--

18:24.520 --> 18:25.853
One or two inches--

18:26.012 --> 18:29.348
And another team
do the hardpack.

18:29.432 --> 18:31.100
- MATTY: Let's go.
- Come on, Matty. Let's find something.

18:31.184 --> 18:33.269
- All right, partner.
- GARY: You want to do the lower

18:33.353 --> 18:35.437
- or the higher beach?
- We'll do the low.

18:35.522 --> 18:37.022
- All right.
- All right, Matty. Find it, baby.

18:37.107 --> 18:39.608
- Whoo! Here we go! One...
- Come on.

18:40.777 --> 18:42.778
It's like the ultimate
scratch-off lotto ticket,

18:42.863 --> 18:44.956
- when you think about it.
- Yes.

18:45.040 --> 18:48.617
MATTY: We are in, like,
treasure-hunting mecca.

18:48.710 --> 18:51.129
You know,
maybe besides Oak Island.

18:52.622 --> 18:53.923
This is where to be.

18:55.375 --> 18:56.717
(beeping)

18:56.802 --> 18:58.052
- That's a signal.
- That's not bad.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.795
Yeah.

18:59.880 --> 19:01.722
(whirring)

19:01.807 --> 19:04.100
Okay, mate, we're in business.

19:05.227 --> 19:07.803
Come on, lucky digger.

19:07.888 --> 19:10.148
- Where do you want it?
- Anywhere you like, mate.

19:11.316 --> 19:13.943
See how easy it is
digging with a sand scoop?

19:18.899 --> 19:20.900
You like that scoop, don't you?

19:20.984 --> 19:22.994
- (laughing): It's all right.
- It's all right?

19:23.078 --> 19:24.570
All right, mate,
let me recheck it.

19:24.654 --> 19:26.238
(beeping)

19:26.323 --> 19:28.249
Yep, you got it out.

19:28.333 --> 19:29.917
Do you want to do the honors?

19:30.002 --> 19:31.410
RICK:
No, no.

19:31.503 --> 19:32.837
You found it.

19:34.923 --> 19:37.249
I thought
that sounded like gold.

19:37.334 --> 19:39.677
Oh, my gosh.

19:43.590 --> 19:45.841
All right, it's in my hand.

19:45.934 --> 19:48.269
- I see it.
- There it is.

19:48.353 --> 19:50.438
- RICK: It's a...
- GARY: A little piece of aluminum.

19:50.522 --> 19:52.607
A lot of this aluminum
that you find

19:52.766 --> 19:54.516
along the Treasure Coast,

19:54.601 --> 19:56.518
um, it was from
the<i> Challenger</i> disaster.

19:56.612 --> 19:58.938
- Wow.
- A heck of a lot of it.

19:59.022 --> 20:01.941
You find these little
molten pieces of aluminum.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.951
Yeah, a lot of people take it
into the museums

20:04.036 --> 20:05.786
and say, "Oh, is this treasure?"

20:05.871 --> 20:10.783
Say no.
More than likely, it's...

20:10.867 --> 20:13.169
stuff left over
from the space<i> Challenger.</i>

20:15.956 --> 20:17.798
NARRATOR:
At 11:38 a.m.

20:17.958 --> 20:21.636
on January 28, 1986,

20:21.720 --> 20:24.055
the Space Shuttle<i> Challenger</i>
launched

20:24.139 --> 20:26.807
from Kennedy Space Center
in Cape Canaveral, Florida...

20:26.967 --> 20:28.300
MAN:
And liftoff.

20:28.393 --> 20:31.646
NARRATOR: for its planned
tenth mission into space.

20:31.730 --> 20:34.890
Just 73 seconds later,

20:34.975 --> 20:37.893
one of the craft's
rocket boosters exploded,

20:37.978 --> 20:40.154
causing it to break
and disintegrate

20:40.313 --> 20:42.064
over the Atlantic Ocean

20:42.148 --> 20:44.825
and tragically taking the lives

20:44.910 --> 20:46.911
of all seven
crew members on board.

20:49.414 --> 20:52.083
GARY: When the Space
Shuttle <i>Challenger</i> broke apart,

20:52.167 --> 20:57.088
it scattered millions of pieces
of molten aluminum

20:57.247 --> 20:59.832
up and down the Treasure Coast
of Florida.

20:59.916 --> 21:02.718
And we're still
recovering it to this day.

21:04.680 --> 21:06.922
We've got a little piece
of aluminum,

21:07.007 --> 21:09.183
a tiny little shredded... Look.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.176
RICK: That's from the
Space Shuttle<i> Challenger.</i>

21:11.270 --> 21:13.345
MATTY:
Wow.

21:13.438 --> 21:15.439
RICK: The thought that
perhaps there were some

21:15.524 --> 21:17.516
remnants of the space shuttle
that had fallen,

21:17.600 --> 21:18.859
that would be incredible.

21:19.019 --> 21:21.862
Maybe we were literally
holding a piece of history.

21:22.022 --> 21:25.941
Not treasure as described
in a treasure trove-like sense

21:26.026 --> 21:27.743
but a real historical item.

21:28.945 --> 21:30.529
MARTY:
All right, Matty.

21:30.613 --> 21:31.864
Hustle something up.

21:31.948 --> 21:33.457
- Come on, baby.
- Come on, baby.

21:36.619 --> 21:38.045
MATTY:
I got a good feeling.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.630
Oh, wow.

21:42.634 --> 21:44.802
Plastic. Dang.

21:49.975 --> 21:51.642
Dang, it's quiet.

21:52.978 --> 21:54.478
Come on, baby.

22:00.060 --> 22:01.643
Any luck, guys?

22:01.728 --> 22:03.395
- No.
- No. Not since our last.

22:03.480 --> 22:04.730
We've got a dry spell here.

22:04.823 --> 22:06.073
It's been quiet.

22:06.158 --> 22:08.233
Yeah, the same here.
The further we've gone away

22:08.318 --> 22:09.985
from that dip down there,

22:10.070 --> 22:12.246
- the less we're finding.
- Mm-hmm.

22:12.405 --> 22:14.915
MARTY: It does not surprise
me at all, nor really disappoint me,

22:15.000 --> 22:16.575
that we didn't find
anything today,

22:16.659 --> 22:19.578
but persistence,
uh, and patience

22:19.671 --> 22:22.173
and staying with it, you know,
might yield a result.

22:22.332 --> 22:24.166
So we're gonna
do it again tomorrow.

22:24.250 --> 22:27.345
We've had a good day searching
for Spanish treasure.

22:27.429 --> 22:30.931
That encourages me
that the next spot we go to,

22:31.016 --> 22:33.934
we have a chance
of finding something good.

22:34.019 --> 22:35.844
But you know what?

22:35.929 --> 22:39.690
I think we should go get
some grog like true pirates.

22:39.775 --> 22:42.943
And I know a perfect bar
down the road.

22:43.103 --> 22:46.605
And I've got a good buddy
of mine, John Brandon, there.

22:46.698 --> 22:49.775
And he'll show us
some good finds, I'm sure.

22:49.868 --> 22:52.027
And maybe he's got a good spot
that we could try out.

22:52.120 --> 22:53.695
All right.
That sounds perfect.

22:53.780 --> 22:54.955
- Lead on.
- Okay.

22:55.115 --> 22:56.207
- Let's do it.
- Grog, it is.

23:02.631 --> 23:06.708
NARRATOR: Later that evening,
Rick, Marty, Matty and Gary

23:06.802 --> 23:08.803
meet with underwater salvager

23:08.887 --> 23:10.888
and treasure hunter
John Brandon,

23:10.972 --> 23:13.298
who has spent
more than three decades

23:13.383 --> 23:17.803
investigating and salvaging
the 1715 Treasure Fleet wrecks.

23:17.896 --> 23:19.522
There's John.

23:20.816 --> 23:22.900
- Gary, how's it going?
- Good, mate. Very good.

23:22.984 --> 23:24.977
- Been a while.
- Yeah, it has, mate.

23:25.070 --> 23:27.146
- Good to see you again, mate.
- How you doing?

23:27.230 --> 23:29.657
JOHN B.: I got interested in
treasure when I was ten years old.

23:29.741 --> 23:32.818
A neighborhood friend of mine
showed me my first silver coins.

23:32.911 --> 23:35.913
I found my first Spanish coin
from the 1715 Fleet

23:35.997 --> 23:38.082
on the beach
when I was 13 years old.

23:38.166 --> 23:42.161
When I was, uh, 17 years old,
Mel Fisher finally hired me,

23:42.245 --> 23:44.997
and I started working
on the 1715 Fleet wrecks.

23:45.090 --> 23:47.091
And this is all
I've ever done my whole life.

23:47.175 --> 23:49.343
And it's been
a lifelong passion,

23:49.428 --> 23:52.004
and I've done
very, very well at it.

23:52.097 --> 23:54.181
I think maybe we're talking
to the right guy, too.

23:54.340 --> 23:56.934
- (laughter) - I get that
feeling right off the bat.

23:57.018 --> 23:58.936
And you know what?
It's not full of chocolate.

23:59.020 --> 24:00.762
- No?
- (laughter)

24:00.847 --> 24:02.514
John, I'll just...
I'll just open with this.

24:02.607 --> 24:04.600
- Sure.
- How old is that coin around your neck?

24:04.684 --> 24:07.027
This coin was minted
in the late 1600s in Mexico,

24:07.187 --> 24:09.447
and, uh, it was on a wreck
that we call Corrigan's Wreck.

24:09.531 --> 24:11.106
I found it on my birthday
one year.

24:11.191 --> 24:12.283
Did you really?

24:12.442 --> 24:14.443
I found 24 of these
big gold doubloons...

24:14.536 --> 24:16.704
- MARTY: Wow.
- One small gold coin,

24:16.863 --> 24:18.956
five 22-karat gold bars

24:19.040 --> 24:21.200
that weighed 13 pounds
altogether.

24:21.284 --> 24:22.284
Oh, my God.

24:22.377 --> 24:24.536
Ten more gold chunks
that were 22 karat

24:24.621 --> 24:26.380
that weighed
another three pounds

24:26.465 --> 24:29.467
and a 135 Spanish
pieces of eight.

24:29.551 --> 24:32.377
As you guys know, finding
treasure is very difficult.

24:32.462 --> 24:34.555
- Yes, yes.
- It's not something easy.

24:34.639 --> 24:36.974
How important is research
to your efforts?

24:37.058 --> 24:41.061
The research is
undefinably important.

24:41.146 --> 24:43.889
When the ships hit
the reefs in 1715,

24:43.982 --> 24:47.234
uh, the seas were 30 feet high,
the wind was 130 knots,

24:47.319 --> 24:49.820
it was a clear
Category 3 hurricane.

24:49.979 --> 24:52.314
They hit the reefs
and literally exploded

24:52.398 --> 24:55.651
and scattered for miles
and miles and miles.

24:55.744 --> 24:58.237
That's what makes it
so difficult

24:58.321 --> 24:59.997
for us to find the material now.

25:00.081 --> 25:02.074
It's scattered
to such a vast area.

25:02.158 --> 25:05.994
So the historical research
is-is invaluable.

25:06.079 --> 25:08.914
You have to have good research.

25:09.007 --> 25:11.425
When the Cabin Wreck sank
right across from here,

25:11.510 --> 25:14.753
it had 125 tons
of silver coins on it.

25:14.846 --> 25:16.922
The Spanish were very good
at their salvage efforts

25:17.006 --> 25:18.924
and recovered about 80% of it.

25:19.008 --> 25:21.352
It still leaves over 20 tons
of silver coins

25:21.436 --> 25:23.270
to be recovered
that we can document--

25:23.355 --> 25:25.272
Not counting contraband,

25:25.431 --> 25:28.442
not counting all kinds of
other things that are involved.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.444
So, I see you've
got some treasure.

25:30.529 --> 25:31.520
I want to see
some real treasure.

25:31.613 --> 25:32.780
Well, I do have
some treasure here.

25:32.864 --> 25:34.690
Right? Let see some treasure.

25:34.774 --> 25:37.701
So we can, uh,
look at a few things.

25:39.362 --> 25:42.122
This is just...
just a variety of material

25:42.207 --> 25:44.116
that comes up
on the wreck sites.

25:44.209 --> 25:47.545
Um, we have...

25:47.704 --> 25:49.713
- a bronze sword hilt.
- MATTY: Whoa.

25:49.872 --> 25:53.292
This hilt was made
somewhere in the Orient

25:53.376 --> 25:55.386
and it got onto the 1715 Fleet.

25:55.545 --> 25:58.297
These are bronze
religious medallions

25:58.381 --> 25:59.974
that come off the wrecks.

26:00.058 --> 26:01.058
MATTY:
Oh, my gosh.

26:01.142 --> 26:02.968
JOHN B.:
All of these came off the beach.

26:03.061 --> 26:04.469
- Those are like saint medals.
- All of these were...

26:04.563 --> 26:06.146
were beach finds.

26:06.231 --> 26:07.472
And they're very,
very beautiful.

26:07.566 --> 26:08.816
MATTY:
Oh, wow.

26:08.975 --> 26:11.727
These are all silver coins--
One day on the beach.

26:11.811 --> 26:14.655
- On the beach?
- One day on the beach.

26:14.739 --> 26:16.490
There's over 200 silver coins
in here-- just over 200.

26:16.649 --> 26:17.992
MATTY:
Wow. Amazing.

26:18.151 --> 26:20.319
Gary, we just spent one day
on the beach. What the hell?

26:20.412 --> 26:22.070
I'll show you a few more things
if you're interested.

26:22.155 --> 26:24.164
- Of course we are.
- I'm giving you gold fever.

26:24.249 --> 26:26.083
- Yeah, you are. Yeah, you are.
- You're gonna get up from this table

26:26.242 --> 26:27.668
and go straight to Oak Island
and start digging.

26:27.827 --> 26:29.753
Yep, that is the truth.

26:29.838 --> 26:32.172
I see, um,
you're sitting closest.

26:32.257 --> 26:34.258
Why don't you... why don't you
bring that thing up here

26:34.342 --> 26:36.093
- and put it on the table?
- You know what?

26:36.177 --> 26:37.919
By God, I'm gonna do that.
You know I'm gonna do that.

26:38.013 --> 26:40.347
- Old as I am...
- Don't set it... don't set it on the table too hard.

26:40.432 --> 26:42.424
Old as I am, by God,
I'm gonna do it.

26:42.508 --> 26:44.685
- JOHN B.: Be careful.
- MARTY: All right. Lift with your back.

26:44.769 --> 26:47.262
- (grunting): Holy crap.
- Wow.

26:47.347 --> 26:49.181
- RICK: That's stunning.
- JOHN B.: How about that, guys?

26:49.265 --> 26:50.774
- MATTY: Wow.
- JOHN B.: Treasure.

26:54.854 --> 26:56.605
- JOHN B.: Be careful. That's 80 pounds.
- MARTY: I will.

26:56.698 --> 26:58.190
(straining):
All right. Holy crap.

26:58.283 --> 26:59.524
- Wow.
- Look at that, guys.

26:59.618 --> 27:00.859
How about that, guys?

27:00.943 --> 27:02.786
Treasure. Treasure.

27:02.945 --> 27:04.955
Let's not put
my fingers underneath it.

27:05.040 --> 27:06.707
- Yeah, don't get your fingers underneath it.
- Look at that.

27:06.866 --> 27:08.542
JOHN B.:
How about that? Isn't that cool?

27:08.627 --> 27:10.127
MARTY:
That is spectacular.

27:10.211 --> 27:12.546
That's a silver bar off
the Spanish galleon<i> Atocha.</i>

27:12.631 --> 27:15.633
In 1985,
we found 36 tons of them.

27:15.792 --> 27:19.294
And all the silver bars
were 99.9% pure silver.

27:19.379 --> 27:21.305
GARY and MATTY:
Wow.

27:22.715 --> 27:25.893
NARRATOR: Much like the
ships of the 1715 Treasure Fleet,

27:26.052 --> 27:30.138
the<i> Nuestra Señora de Atocha</i>
was a Spanish galleon ship

27:30.231 --> 27:32.224
which, while delivering riches

27:32.308 --> 27:34.818
back to mainland Spain
in 1622...

27:36.979 --> 27:38.739
disappeared
off the Florida coast

27:38.898 --> 27:41.066
during a violent hurricane.

27:41.150 --> 27:44.244
Both the<i> Atocha</i>
and its precious cargo,

27:44.404 --> 27:49.074
an estimated $500 million worth
of gold, silver and jewels,

27:49.158 --> 27:54.413
were considered lost until 1973
when the wreck was rediscovered

27:54.506 --> 27:57.332
by legendary salvager
Mel Fisher and his team,

27:57.417 --> 28:00.252
including John Brandon.

28:00.345 --> 28:03.255
JOHN B.: There's still plenty
of treasure to be found,

28:03.348 --> 28:07.008
so these are just, um...

28:07.102 --> 28:08.686
MARTY:
What you got there, sir?

28:08.845 --> 28:10.846
Okay, well, it's good to get
a little incentive,

28:10.939 --> 28:13.440
so this is part of what
you guys are looking for.

28:13.599 --> 28:16.017
- MARTY: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
- GARY: Oh, listen to that clink.

28:16.111 --> 28:17.528
- Wow.
- (excited laughter)

28:17.687 --> 28:19.271
JOHN B.:
You're gonna find some gold,

28:19.355 --> 28:20.939
and the gold shines forever.

28:21.023 --> 28:22.357
And it came off
the bottom of the ocean

28:22.442 --> 28:23.775
looking just like that.

28:23.860 --> 28:25.694
MARTY: What would this
have been worth in the day?

28:25.778 --> 28:26.954
- In the day...
- Would this be a guy's week's pay,

28:27.113 --> 28:28.622
a month's pay, a year's pay?

28:28.707 --> 28:30.958
- Probably about six months on a coin that size.
- MATTY: Wow.

28:31.042 --> 28:32.284
- MARTY: That is really cool, John.
- JOHN B.: It's good.

28:32.368 --> 28:33.544
- It's lots of fun.
- MARTY: Really, really cool.

28:33.628 --> 28:35.120
JOHN B.: Get out there
and find some more.

28:35.213 --> 28:36.705
MARTY:
Sounds good.

28:36.798 --> 28:38.874
- John, we want to thank you very, very much.
- Absolutely.

28:38.967 --> 28:40.551
- This is absolutely great.
- Yeah.

28:40.635 --> 28:44.221
You've done a great job
of motivating us now.

28:44.305 --> 28:47.224
We-we had a bad day today--
We didn't find anything--

28:47.308 --> 28:49.718
But we're definitely gonna
give it a good go tomorrow,

28:49.811 --> 28:51.395
probably go in,
looking down there

28:51.554 --> 28:53.731
at the old salvage camp
south of Corrigan's.

28:53.890 --> 28:55.899
There you go. There you go,
south of Corrigan's.

28:56.058 --> 28:58.310
- That might be a good spot to look.
- MARTY: Good deal.

28:58.403 --> 28:59.653
Give it your best shot, guys.

28:59.812 --> 29:00.821
- We'll do it.
- We will.

29:00.980 --> 29:03.398
Here's to a case of those
in the Money Pit.

29:03.483 --> 29:04.491
- Yes.
- There you go.

29:04.650 --> 29:06.151
- Cheers. Treasure.
- Treasure.

29:06.235 --> 29:07.870
- Thank you very much, John.
- Absolutely.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.501
MARTY:
All right, guys.

29:14.660 --> 29:15.577
- Here we be.
- GARY: Yep.

29:15.661 --> 29:17.245
NARRATOR:
The following morning,

29:17.330 --> 29:19.006
in Vero Beach, Florida...

29:19.090 --> 29:21.833
- Today's the day, Gary.
- You got that right, mate.

29:21.926 --> 29:24.503
NARRATOR: brothers
Rick and Marty Lagina,

29:24.596 --> 29:28.682
along with Matty Blake and metal
detection expert Gary Drayton,

29:28.841 --> 29:30.842
are resuming their search
for valuables

29:30.935 --> 29:34.346
and precious artifacts
from the 1715 Treasure Fleet.

29:34.430 --> 29:36.273
I think we should
switch up, right?

29:36.432 --> 29:38.016
- Switch teams? Okay.
- You go... you go with Gary.

29:38.100 --> 29:39.601
- All right. I like that.
- You and I.

29:39.685 --> 29:41.853
- What's the wager?
- How about a full dinner?

29:41.946 --> 29:44.856
You know what? You find
a piece of the queen's jewels,

29:44.941 --> 29:47.117
Marty and I is gonna pay
for dinner.

29:47.202 --> 29:48.276
- MARTY: That's right. That's right.
- GARY: We'd be quite happy to.

29:48.361 --> 29:49.369
Cool. So let's get going.

29:49.529 --> 29:51.029
Let's go find some Bravo Tango.

29:51.122 --> 29:52.614
I'm switching Laginas.

29:52.698 --> 29:54.625
- MARTY: There you go.
- MATTY: Let's go.

29:54.784 --> 29:57.369
NARRATOR: Today, they
are moving their investigation

29:57.453 --> 29:59.880
approximately one mile south
to the site

30:00.039 --> 30:01.957
of one of the original
salvage camps,

30:02.041 --> 30:05.552
which was established
by the Spanish in 1715

30:05.637 --> 30:08.547
for the purpose of recovering
the sunken treasure.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.307
MARTY: All right, Gary.
Are we almost there?

30:10.391 --> 30:11.466
Yep, this is it.

30:11.559 --> 30:13.885
- This is it?
- We are opposite the camp.

30:13.970 --> 30:15.637
- So, right here...
- Yeah.

30:15.721 --> 30:18.056
Couple hundred years ago,
a bunch of Spanish guys

30:18.149 --> 30:19.900
- were salvaging wrecks right out there.
- GARY: Yep.

30:20.059 --> 30:21.810
MATTY:
A lot of tragedy happened here

30:21.894 --> 30:23.728
but also a lot of triumph--
You know, they survived,

30:23.813 --> 30:25.647
and they built a camp
and they salvaged.

30:25.740 --> 30:27.908
- I mean, it-it worked.
- GARY: Yeah.

30:28.067 --> 30:29.993
So, the actual salvage camp

30:30.152 --> 30:31.995
is right here
in between those steps...

30:32.154 --> 30:33.822
MATTY:
Yes. Okay.

30:33.915 --> 30:36.074
And that flagpole to the south.

30:36.167 --> 30:37.751
MARTY:
To the flagpole.

30:37.836 --> 30:41.421
I think the best way
of searching this area is

30:41.581 --> 30:44.675
one team start at the steps,

30:44.834 --> 30:47.594
one at the flagpole,
and walk towards each other.

30:47.753 --> 30:48.762
Okay. All right,
I like that.

30:48.921 --> 30:51.014
And there's got to be all kinds

30:51.099 --> 30:54.685
of coins and artifacts,
especially at a salvage camp.

30:54.844 --> 30:57.012
- Let's get going.
- Okay. Let's find some stuff.

30:57.105 --> 30:58.772
- MATTY: All right!
- RICK: Show 'em what you've got.

30:58.857 --> 30:59.857
MATTY:
Yeah, I'm feeling good.

31:00.016 --> 31:02.276
Let's kick some
treasure-hunting butt.

31:02.435 --> 31:03.602
MARTY:
I'm ready.

31:03.695 --> 31:05.437
Where do we start, Gary?

31:05.530 --> 31:06.855
Somewhere in here?

31:06.948 --> 31:08.448
Yeah, right
at the flagpole, mate.

31:08.533 --> 31:09.941
Okay.

31:10.034 --> 31:11.326
- Okay.
- I'm ready.

31:12.695 --> 31:13.787
Let's go.

31:15.531 --> 31:18.116
- Here, this dip looks promising.
- All right.

31:18.209 --> 31:20.201
The man with the scoop is ready.

31:20.286 --> 31:22.704
- Scoop up treasure.
- MATTY: Here we go.

31:22.797 --> 31:24.715
We could pull one
little thing off this beach

31:24.799 --> 31:26.800
- and put my kid through college.
- (chuckles): Yeah.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.135
- There you go. There you go.
- So...

31:29.304 --> 31:31.471
- (beeping)
- MATTY: Oh.

31:31.631 --> 31:34.308
- Right there, brother.
- That's a chunky sound there.

31:38.638 --> 31:39.813
(beeps)

31:40.899 --> 31:43.191
- RICK: There it is.
- MATTY: Got it.

31:47.313 --> 31:48.396
(beeping)

31:48.481 --> 31:50.574
Oh, wow, yeah, it's
in here somewhere, Rick.

31:50.733 --> 31:52.159
- (rapid beeping)
- Oh.

31:54.153 --> 31:56.154
Look at that color green.

31:56.238 --> 31:58.156
(beeps)

31:58.249 --> 32:00.575
That looks old, Rick.

32:00.660 --> 32:02.577
That looks like the top of a...

32:02.662 --> 32:04.087
- of a spike or a thick nail or something.
- Yeah.

32:04.172 --> 32:06.748
Yeah, you might have a boat
spike or part of a boat spike.

32:06.832 --> 32:08.833
Wow.

32:08.918 --> 32:11.261
NARRATOR:
Finding an ancient deck spike,

32:11.346 --> 32:14.339
one potentially connected
to the 1715 Spanish Fleet,

32:14.423 --> 32:16.174
is an encouraging sign.

32:16.258 --> 32:17.684
That's pretty cool.

32:17.769 --> 32:20.187
NARRATOR: It suggests
that other important artifacts--

32:20.346 --> 32:22.856
Or perhaps even treasure--

32:22.941 --> 32:25.943
May have also recently
washed up on shore.

32:26.102 --> 32:28.269
MATTY: In my world,
this is a top-pocket find.

32:28.363 --> 32:30.438
- RICK: There you go.
- MATTY: Whoo!

32:30.531 --> 32:32.524
GARY: We're walking
in the footsteps of...

32:32.617 --> 32:34.201
- History.
- Yep.

32:34.360 --> 32:35.702
- (beeping)
- MARTY: Aha.

32:35.861 --> 32:37.445
GARY:
That's a signal, mate.

32:37.530 --> 32:38.789
- So...
- Right there.

32:38.948 --> 32:41.124
That's where the center
of the target is, mate.

32:43.536 --> 32:44.795
Uh-huh. I'll put it up here.

32:49.125 --> 32:50.375
All right, where'd he go?

32:50.468 --> 32:51.876
That means it's on edge.

32:51.961 --> 32:53.303
Let me try the pin-pointer.

32:59.885 --> 33:01.728
- (laughing): Whoa!
- Come on.

33:01.813 --> 33:03.313
Look at that.

33:03.398 --> 33:05.816
- MARTY: Wow.
- GARY: That is fantastic.

33:09.645 --> 33:11.563
That's what
we want to be finding.

33:11.656 --> 33:12.906
- MARTY: Is that a silver coin?
- GARY: It could possibly be.

33:12.991 --> 33:15.409
I mean, it's the right shape.

33:15.493 --> 33:17.402
- It's the right color.
- Mm-hmm.

33:17.486 --> 33:18.662
That's a type of find you want.

33:18.821 --> 33:20.488
It looks like... looks like
silver to me, Gary.

33:20.573 --> 33:21.832
GARY:
That is fantastic.

33:21.991 --> 33:23.333
You can tell that's
been there a while.

33:23.418 --> 33:24.668
MARTY:
If you... if you clean that up,

33:24.827 --> 33:25.994
there could be something
written on it, too.

33:26.078 --> 33:27.996
Yeah. It's definitely oxidized.

33:28.080 --> 33:30.757
There's a good chance
that this is Spanish.

33:30.916 --> 33:33.760
It's 1715 Fleet silver.

33:33.845 --> 33:35.754
- Let's keep going.
- Great start, mate.

33:35.838 --> 33:37.764
Just in case.
Maybe two is better than one.

33:38.933 --> 33:41.309
See if there's
anything else in there.

33:43.012 --> 33:45.188
No, I think we're good.

33:45.273 --> 33:46.606
That's a pretty cool find.

33:46.766 --> 33:48.358
That's an amazing find.

33:48.443 --> 33:49.860
Something from
the Treasure Coast.

33:49.944 --> 33:52.020
You know, this is it.
This is why we're here.

33:52.104 --> 33:53.104
- All right.
- Here's the man.

33:53.197 --> 33:54.114
- Hey.
- Losers.

33:54.198 --> 33:55.857
- Ah.
- Any luck?

33:55.941 --> 33:57.367
- What do you got?
- Ask the man.

33:57.526 --> 33:59.360
(laughing):
Today was a much better day.

33:59.445 --> 34:01.196
- You look pretty happy.
- Yeah, man.

34:01.280 --> 34:02.280
I-I don't know.
Well, I don't know.

34:02.364 --> 34:03.281
I hope this isn't another one

34:03.374 --> 34:05.208
of those disappointments,
but we think

34:05.367 --> 34:07.044
we got something
that might be kind of old.

34:09.205 --> 34:11.289
- That's period, mate.
- Whoo!

34:11.373 --> 34:13.374
- That's a ship spike.
- Come on!

34:13.468 --> 34:15.469
- Let's go!
- MARTY: Is it really?

34:15.553 --> 34:17.629
Yeah, that's period. That's
the end of a ship spike, mate.

34:17.713 --> 34:18.880
- There's no doubt.
- Oh, yeah.

34:18.973 --> 34:20.965
- There's no doubt about that.
- Yeah, that's...

34:21.050 --> 34:23.226
Look at it.
I mean, you could see...

34:23.385 --> 34:24.719
That's a... that's bronze
or something, right?

34:24.804 --> 34:27.722
Yeah, it's probably the top
of a bronze ship spike.

34:27.807 --> 34:30.067
- MARTY: Well done.
- RICK: would bronze turn green like that?

34:30.151 --> 34:31.893
- Yeah, that's that patina you want.
- Yeah.

34:31.977 --> 34:34.071
With all those little shells

34:34.230 --> 34:37.324
and little bits
of sand particles...

34:37.408 --> 34:39.651
- I'm impressed.
- As Rick always says,

34:39.744 --> 34:41.986
- it's a team effort here.
- GARY: Well done, mate.

34:42.071 --> 34:43.905
- You've got a bit of a ship there, mate.
- MARTY: Look at him.

34:43.989 --> 34:45.415
- Spanish galleon.
- MATTY: I'm, like, emotional.

34:45.500 --> 34:46.583
I'm literally
emotional right now.

34:46.667 --> 34:48.576
Oh, that is fantastic.
Look at that face.

34:48.661 --> 34:50.161
- Wow.
- MARTY: Yeah, I know.

34:50.246 --> 34:52.172
- Kid from New England.
- All right, well, w-wait a minute.

34:52.256 --> 34:56.167
- We didn't get skunked. Gary?
- Yeah, um...

34:56.260 --> 34:57.844
(chuckles)

34:57.929 --> 35:01.890
I refer to this
as a Batman find.

35:03.175 --> 35:04.342
Batman find?

35:04.435 --> 35:05.677
(humming "Batman Theme")

35:05.770 --> 35:07.679
♪ Matt Man. ♪

35:07.772 --> 35:09.013
Check that out!

35:09.098 --> 35:10.849
- MARTY: That's a piece of silver.
- Oh, whoa.

35:10.942 --> 35:14.194
GARY: I think we've
topped bronze with silver.

35:14.353 --> 35:15.520
- MARTY: With silver. Silver. It's like...
- MATTY: Wow.

35:15.613 --> 35:17.697
MARTY: It's like rock
paper scissors, baby.

35:17.782 --> 35:19.440
MATTY:
Oh, yeah, you can really see it.

35:19.525 --> 35:21.776
Yeah, that's a... that's
a piece of tarnished silver.

35:21.861 --> 35:23.620
- That's...
- GARY: Yeah, it looks like it.

35:23.704 --> 35:25.455
GARY:
More than likely, we've now got

35:25.540 --> 35:27.457
two pieces...

35:27.542 --> 35:30.451
- MARTY: From the wreck.
- Of the Spanish 1715 Fleet.

35:30.545 --> 35:32.704
- Come on!
- Oh, I think we did.

35:32.788 --> 35:35.298
GARY: I know they're
not queen's jewels,

35:35.383 --> 35:36.958
but these are really,
really nice.

35:37.042 --> 35:39.386
People come here
and never, ever find

35:39.470 --> 35:41.221
something like
we've recovered today.

35:41.380 --> 35:42.806
MARTY:
Yeah, for sure.

35:42.965 --> 35:44.891
- MATTY: This is unbelievable.
- GARY: Yeah.

35:45.050 --> 35:47.051
MATTY: Now, when you do
this, Gary, here in your backyard,

35:47.136 --> 35:48.887
you're rocking and rolling,
you're making finds,

35:48.971 --> 35:51.389
you... you know what it is,
pretty much your expertise,

35:51.482 --> 35:53.984
but where do you go
to, like, really find out?

35:54.143 --> 35:56.978
If I'm unsure
of anything like this,

35:57.071 --> 35:59.239
I take it to the local
Treasure Museum.

35:59.398 --> 36:02.826
They see so many artifacts
that are brought in to them.

36:02.985 --> 36:06.237
There is an expert there,
and he will know.

36:06.330 --> 36:08.156
There you go. Exactly.

36:08.240 --> 36:09.824
All right, well,
let's go show it to the pros

36:09.917 --> 36:10.909
- and see what they say.
- Yeah.

36:10.993 --> 36:12.085
- All right, let's go.
- All right.

36:12.244 --> 36:13.161
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

36:13.245 --> 36:14.588
GARY:
That spike is spectacular.

36:14.672 --> 36:16.131
MATTY:
It's incredible.

36:21.012 --> 36:22.670
NARRATOR:
Later that afternoon...

36:22.755 --> 36:24.181
COREY:
Hello. How are you guys doing?

36:24.265 --> 36:25.265
- MARTY: Good.
- GARY: Good, thanks.

36:25.424 --> 36:27.184
- I'm Corey.
- NARRATOR: the Laginas,

36:27.343 --> 36:29.769
along with Matty Blake
and Gary Drayton,

36:29.854 --> 36:33.431
arrive at the McLarty
Treasure Museum in Vero Beach.

36:33.515 --> 36:34.858
I'm gonna take you over here.

36:35.017 --> 36:37.268
We're gonna go meet
my friend John, and, uh,

36:37.353 --> 36:39.771
hopefully, he'll be able to
answer all your questions about

36:39.855 --> 36:41.281
- all the great stuff that you found.
- MARTY: Great. Excellent.

36:41.365 --> 36:42.857
- Okay, mate.
- Perfect. - Excellent.

36:42.950 --> 36:45.109
NARRATOR:
Established in 1971

36:45.194 --> 36:47.370
near the site of the original

36:47.455 --> 36:50.373
survivors' camp
of the 1715 Fleet,

36:50.458 --> 36:54.535
the McLarty Treasure Museum
houses a number of important

36:54.620 --> 36:57.214
artifacts and precious valuables
that have been recovered

36:57.298 --> 37:00.541
by various salvage operations
over the years.

37:00.635 --> 37:02.543
Hello, sir. I'm Marty Lagina.

37:02.628 --> 37:03.878
- How are you?
- I'm John.

37:03.963 --> 37:05.046
- Hi, John.
- Nice to meet you.

37:05.130 --> 37:06.890
- Pleasure.
- GARY: Hi, mate. Gary Drayton.

37:07.049 --> 37:09.142
- Long time, no see, John.
- Yeah, that's true.

37:09.227 --> 37:12.220
NARRATOR: With more than
five decades of firsthand experience

37:12.304 --> 37:15.315
investigating and taking part
in salvage operations

37:15.399 --> 37:18.226
of the 1715
Treasure Fleet wrecks

37:18.310 --> 37:20.478
with Kip Wagner and Mel Fisher,

37:20.562 --> 37:23.740
Dr. de Bry is not only
the foremost expert

37:23.824 --> 37:26.243
on the vast manifest
of lost riches

37:26.327 --> 37:28.569
but he also serves
as the director

37:28.654 --> 37:30.914
of the 1715 Fleet Society.

37:32.583 --> 37:37.328
We've actually just come back
from where the salvage camp was.

37:37.421 --> 37:39.163
- Oh, okay. Okay, good.
- South of Turtle Trail.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.757
Have you found anything?

37:40.916 --> 37:42.926
Yeah, we believe
we've found a couple of...

37:43.085 --> 37:46.221
hopefully artifacts
that you can identify.

37:47.423 --> 37:49.432
Ooh, that looks like a coin.

37:56.849 --> 37:59.276
MATTY:
Oh, look at that.

37:59.360 --> 38:01.861
- That is awful shiny, Gary.
- Hmm, yes.

38:01.946 --> 38:04.447
GARY:
Yeah, yeah, looks shiny to me.

38:04.532 --> 38:07.367
Shiny silver thing.

38:07.451 --> 38:09.536
JOHN D.: You don't see a
design. You don't see a cross.

38:09.695 --> 38:11.279
You don't see a shield.

38:11.363 --> 38:13.290
You-you see nothing, basically.

38:15.459 --> 38:18.795
This looks like a coin, but
I think it's a piece of rust.

38:18.879 --> 38:20.630
- I hate to say that, but...
- Dang.

38:20.789 --> 38:22.799
- No, that's what we want.
- No, no, no. Hey.

38:22.883 --> 38:24.301
That's why we take
the artifacts...

38:24.385 --> 38:25.626
- To an expert.
- To the experts,

38:25.720 --> 38:27.137
- like we do on Oak Island.
- MARTY: That's right.

38:27.221 --> 38:28.305
This, however...

38:30.382 --> 38:33.935
is very, very, very special.

38:35.137 --> 38:36.604
Oh, my God.

38:40.401 --> 38:41.901
NARRATOR:
Ath the Mclarty Museum

38:41.986 --> 38:44.404
in the town
of Vero Beach, Florida,

38:44.488 --> 38:46.156
archaeologist Dr. John de Bry
is examining

38:46.315 --> 38:49.159
what he believes to be
a genuine artifact

38:49.243 --> 38:52.737
connected to the historic
1715 Spanish Treasure Fleet.

38:52.821 --> 38:58.076
So, here we have a piece of
copper which is kind of unusual.

38:58.160 --> 39:02.088
And I'm glad you found this,
because this is really rare.

39:02.173 --> 39:05.583
This is absolutely
a head of a spike.

39:06.835 --> 39:10.421
- MATTY: That's right.
- You can see the, uh, square edge.

39:10.506 --> 39:12.924
- MATTY: Oh, my God.
- RICK: Yeah, beautiful.

39:13.008 --> 39:15.018
MATTY:
Look at all that.

39:15.102 --> 39:16.936
MATTY: That's not a
run-of-the-mill deck spike?

39:17.096 --> 39:19.180
That's kind of special, maybe
ornate or something like that?

39:19.264 --> 39:21.107
Yeah, absolutely.

39:21.192 --> 39:25.436
Generally, for that period,
ships were made in Europe.

39:25.521 --> 39:28.615
Copper had a huge
intrinsic value in Europe.

39:28.699 --> 39:31.776
This definitely is
from the 1715 Fleet.

39:31.860 --> 39:33.194
RICK:
Well done, Matty.

39:33.278 --> 39:35.029
- JOHN D.: Absolutely.
- Yeah.

39:35.114 --> 39:38.458
To find such a spike
is kind of special.

39:38.542 --> 39:40.710
That's fantastic. Wow.

39:40.869 --> 39:43.963
We found a piece
of the 1715 Fleet galleon.

39:44.048 --> 39:45.882
MATTY:
It's incredible.

39:45.966 --> 39:48.134
- Well, Doctor, this is phenomenal.
- MARTY: Yeah, it's great.

39:48.219 --> 39:49.969
Thank you so much
for your expertise.

39:50.054 --> 39:52.389
And thank you for letting
the good guys win tonight,

39:52.473 --> 39:54.808
and, uh, better luck
next time, fellas.

39:54.967 --> 39:56.634
- You're a wealth of knowledge.
- What can I... what can I say?

39:56.718 --> 39:58.302
This has been phenomenal.

39:58.387 --> 39:59.720
I mean, we-we actually...
we did it.

39:59.814 --> 40:00.897
I mean, we did it.
This is great.

40:00.981 --> 40:02.056
Thank you so much.

40:02.141 --> 40:03.483
There's your piece of rust.

40:03.567 --> 40:05.309
- Yeah.
- And there's your...

40:05.403 --> 40:07.570
Our historic piece of...
Hey, that piece of rust

40:07.729 --> 40:09.906
could've come from
the 1715 Fleet, right?

40:09.990 --> 40:11.732
- Absolutely.
- Nice. There we have it.

40:11.826 --> 40:13.243
- We're back in the game.
- Absolutely.

40:13.402 --> 40:15.495
- So it's a bottom-pocket find.
- (laughter)

40:15.579 --> 40:17.822
- Absolutely.
- I learned...

40:17.906 --> 40:19.916
I learned how to do this move
from the best in the business.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.918
(laughter)

40:22.002 --> 40:23.828
RICK:
Dr. de Bry, thank you very much.

40:23.912 --> 40:25.880
- Appreciate your time.
- JOHN D.: My pleasure.

40:27.842 --> 40:29.759
GARY:
I've always wanted you guys

40:29.918 --> 40:34.848
to come down here
and to see this story.

40:34.932 --> 40:37.675
And, of course,
go in search of treasure

40:37.768 --> 40:41.688
but to realize that it's not
just about the treasure.

40:41.772 --> 40:43.022
It's about the story.

40:43.107 --> 40:44.849
Just like Oak Island.

40:44.942 --> 40:49.187
A true treasure hunter
in the conventional sense, John,

40:49.271 --> 40:51.948
his initial treasures he put
on that table surprised me.

40:52.032 --> 40:54.284
I mean, he had gold
and he had silver

40:54.368 --> 40:56.777
and he had bricks of silver,
but the things he put

40:56.862 --> 40:58.362
on the table first
weren't those things.

40:58.447 --> 41:00.540
- They were not.
- They were basically things

41:00.624 --> 41:02.876
we've sort of already found
on Oak Island.

41:02.960 --> 41:06.212
They were bits and bobs
of everyday life.

41:06.297 --> 41:08.131
And he considered those
treasure for sure.

41:08.290 --> 41:09.624
Yes.

41:09.717 --> 41:12.210
RICK:
This trip was fantastic.

41:12.303 --> 41:14.721
We got a little bit
of actual treasure hunting in.

41:14.805 --> 41:16.973
That's like
the icing on the cake.

41:17.132 --> 41:20.393
This has been
a fantastic adventure

41:20.478 --> 41:23.137
with my favorite
treasure hunters,

41:23.222 --> 41:25.648
and I want to know
when you're coming back down.

41:25.807 --> 41:27.150
Oh...

41:27.234 --> 41:28.726
Next hurricane, Gary.

41:28.810 --> 41:30.653
Yeah, we'll watch that weather.

41:30.738 --> 41:32.980
GARY:
Hey, can we just call ourselves

41:33.065 --> 41:34.982
the Fellowship
of the Dig South now?

41:35.067 --> 41:36.493
- MATTY: Yes!
- (laughter)
