00:12.186 --> 00:14.449
- What do we got?
- Lorenzo Aspromonte.

00:14.492 --> 00:16.233
55. Owned the place.

00:16.277 --> 00:18.409
Looks like multiple gunshots
to the chest.

00:18.453 --> 00:20.237
Probably happened
sometime last night.

00:20.281 --> 00:21.847
Man.

00:21.891 --> 00:23.284
You knew him?

00:23.327 --> 00:25.416
Well, we hung out
here as kids.

00:25.460 --> 00:27.375
Place hasn't changed at all.

00:27.418 --> 00:28.898
They hit the register?

00:28.941 --> 00:30.508
No. And no sign
of forced entry.

00:30.552 --> 00:32.509
Girl over there
found the body.

00:32.554 --> 00:34.338
Thanks.

00:35.383 --> 00:36.862
What's your name?

00:36.906 --> 00:38.777
Carmen Russo.

00:38.821 --> 00:40.388
I'm the assistant manager.

00:40.431 --> 00:41.693
You worked for the deceased?

00:41.737 --> 00:43.956
Since high school.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.089
I can't believe this happened.

00:46.133 --> 00:47.743
When's the last time
you saw him alive?

00:47.786 --> 00:49.092
Last night.

00:49.136 --> 00:51.355
I left around 11:00.

00:51.399 --> 00:53.531
He and Angelica
open and close the place.

00:53.575 --> 00:55.881
Angelica?Lorenzo's daughter.

00:55.925 --> 00:58.188
She manages the restaurant.

00:58.232 --> 00:59.624
If Angelica opens the place,

00:59.668 --> 01:01.757
how come it wasn't her
who found the body?

01:01.800 --> 01:03.933
She didn't show up this morning.

01:05.239 --> 01:06.457
Did she call in?

01:06.501 --> 01:07.676
No.

01:07.719 --> 01:10.331
How did Angelica and
her old man get along?

01:10.374 --> 01:14.248
I mean, you know, working
with family can be tough.

01:18.078 --> 01:21.516
We're gonna need to speak
to Angelica.

01:30.438 --> 01:32.614
You remind me
of a partner I used to have.

01:32.657 --> 01:34.485
I bet she was way
better rested.

01:34.529 --> 01:36.357
You're signing out
kind of late.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.272
There was another cab robbery.

01:38.315 --> 01:40.274
Makes, what, four this month?Five.

01:40.317 --> 01:42.232
All early mornings

01:42.276 --> 01:45.235
when they're coming off a
night shift, full of cash.

01:45.279 --> 01:48.717
I told Sergeant McNichols we
should run a decoy operation,

01:48.760 --> 01:50.371
me as the driver.

01:50.414 --> 01:51.937
Any of the other victims women?

01:51.981 --> 01:53.548
I'm not sure. Why?

01:53.591 --> 01:56.116
You generally want the decoy
to resemble the victims.

01:58.770 --> 02:00.555
I got a steak sandwich
for you in the fridge.

02:00.598 --> 02:03.601
Breakfast of champions.

02:08.301 --> 02:10.869
Animal came clean
on every charge.

02:10.913 --> 02:12.654
He's toast.

02:12.697 --> 02:14.134
You'd think so.

02:14.177 --> 02:15.918
No, I know so.

02:15.961 --> 02:18.964
The confession was taken
by Detective Kim Andrews.

02:19.008 --> 02:21.619
Yeah, so?She's on the D.A.'s
naughty list.

02:21.663 --> 02:22.664
His what?

02:24.492 --> 02:28.017
The D.A. started a list
of NYPD officers

02:28.060 --> 02:31.281
with adverse
credibility findings.

02:31.325 --> 02:33.457
In English, please?

02:33.501 --> 02:35.198
They get blackballed.

02:35.242 --> 02:36.808
And why is Andrews
on this list?

02:36.852 --> 02:39.289
A judge threw out
a confession she elicited

02:39.333 --> 02:42.162
from a sexual assault case
two years ago.

02:42.205 --> 02:43.337
Well, that was then.

02:43.380 --> 02:44.947
This is now. That
doesn't mean Kent's

02:44.990 --> 02:46.514
confession won't hold up.

02:47.515 --> 02:49.995
The D.A. has a responsibility

02:50.039 --> 02:54.304
to consider credibility problems
that might impede a conviction.

02:54.348 --> 02:56.263
This prick

02:56.306 --> 02:57.829
targets disabled victims

02:57.873 --> 02:59.135
in home invasions.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.268
He's the worst kind of scumbag.

03:01.311 --> 03:04.009
It's got to be worth a shot.

03:04.053 --> 03:06.490
Not according to the boss.

03:10.712 --> 03:12.670
This a joke?

03:12.714 --> 03:13.889
I wish it was, boss.

03:13.932 --> 03:16.239
We have a signed confession.

03:16.283 --> 03:17.719
Yeah.
We do, but...

03:17.762 --> 03:19.590
Someone else confess
to the crimes?

03:19.634 --> 03:20.591
No, sir.

03:20.635 --> 03:21.984
Then someone please tell me

03:22.027 --> 03:24.726
how this predator
is gonna go free.

03:24.769 --> 03:26.554
They got a naughty list.

03:29.426 --> 03:31.385
A what?

03:31.428 --> 03:33.691
The D.A.'s keeping
a confidential list

03:33.735 --> 03:37.739
of NYPD officers whose record
could impede convictions.

03:39.784 --> 03:42.700
Last time I checked,
I thought it was myjob

03:42.744 --> 03:45.834
to evaluate the fitness
of myofficers.

03:45.877 --> 03:47.227
Damn straight.

03:47.270 --> 03:50.491
To be fair, the D.A.'s office
has limited resources.

03:50.534 --> 03:53.015
Which they're deploying
to be unfair to our cops!

03:53.058 --> 03:54.190
What about our resources?

03:54.234 --> 03:56.192
We created a special task force

03:56.236 --> 03:57.846
to identify and
arrest this guy.Just the messenger here.

03:57.889 --> 04:00.022
And they're not even saying
Kent's confession is messed up.

04:00.065 --> 04:02.938
They're saying anything
this detective brings

04:02.981 --> 04:04.505
ain't getting prosecuted.

04:04.548 --> 04:06.507
Which means her career
is effectively over

04:06.550 --> 04:09.510
along with anyone else on
the D.A.'s "naughty list."

04:09.553 --> 04:11.947
And this isn't
a letter to Santa.

04:11.990 --> 04:13.862
Let's call it what it is:

04:13.905 --> 04:15.472
a blacklist.

04:41.411 --> 04:43.413
Angelica's not
in her apartment.

04:43.457 --> 04:45.197
Or answering her cell phone.

04:45.241 --> 04:46.416
You speak to her mother?

04:46.460 --> 04:47.939
Yeah. She hasn't
spoken to Angelica

04:47.983 --> 04:49.637
since yesterday morning.

04:49.680 --> 04:52.770
Coworkers say the restaurant
is her life-- 24-7.

04:52.814 --> 04:54.511
Yeah, well, it's a funny
time to play hooky.

04:54.555 --> 04:56.121
Let's issue a want-card.

04:56.165 --> 04:58.254
Yeah. Will do.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.387
Bartender said Angelica
and her father

05:00.430 --> 05:02.954
were going at it
pretty good last night.What about?

05:02.998 --> 05:06.393
Well, apparently, the restaurant
isn't doing too well.

05:06.436 --> 05:09.221
Angelica wants to redecorate,
change the menu.

05:09.265 --> 05:11.223
- Her father wasn't having it.
- That's no reason to shoot him.

05:11.267 --> 05:14.357
Well, Angelica's next in line
to inherit the place.

05:14.401 --> 05:16.925
If she feels that he's running
it into the ground...Well,

05:16.968 --> 05:18.056
if the Reagans
killed each other

05:18.100 --> 05:19.841
every time they had
a disagreement,

05:19.884 --> 05:21.538
there'd be nobody left at
the Sunday dinner table.

05:21.582 --> 05:23.627
Baez.

05:25.412 --> 05:27.327
Got it. Thanks.

05:28.502 --> 05:31.896
Angelica Aspromonte
had a handgun registered

05:31.940 --> 05:34.334
to her name. Same caliber
as the murder weapon.

05:35.683 --> 05:37.989
And there's that.

05:48.217 --> 05:51.960
You know, I have every right
to expect the D.A. himself.

05:52.003 --> 05:53.831
He's on the way to Albany.

05:53.875 --> 05:55.267
Ground rules, then.

05:55.311 --> 05:57.487
You take his place in a
sit-down, you take his heat.

05:57.531 --> 06:00.708
I'm fully capable
of representing our office.

06:00.751 --> 06:04.581
Are you keeping a
blacklist of my officers?

06:04.625 --> 06:06.757
I wouldn't call it that.

06:06.801 --> 06:08.063
Well, I would.

06:08.106 --> 06:11.022
Sidelining cops based
on unproven allegations,

06:11.066 --> 06:13.677
keeping a no-fly list
for prosecutions.

06:13.721 --> 06:15.853
We have to assess
the strength of every case,

06:15.897 --> 06:18.247
including the credibility
of the cops involved.

06:18.290 --> 06:20.162
Which is fine on
a retail basis.

06:20.205 --> 06:21.381
But a blacklist?

06:21.424 --> 06:22.904
That's something
else altogether.

06:22.947 --> 06:24.819
The D.A. feels that...No.

06:24.862 --> 06:27.212
No laying it off
on a third party.

06:27.256 --> 06:30.215
Our office takes the position

06:30.259 --> 06:33.871
that going to trial
with a compromised officer

06:33.915 --> 06:35.395
would be..."Compromised"?

06:35.438 --> 06:37.701
I don't recall seeing
that in the Patrol Guide

06:37.745 --> 06:39.964
regarding an
officer's integrity.

06:40.008 --> 06:41.444
It's the D.A.'s term.

06:41.488 --> 06:44.621
Then I would like to read
the protocol he used

06:44.665 --> 06:46.754
to arrive at
that designation.

06:46.797 --> 06:49.321
There isn't
an official protocol.Okay.

06:49.365 --> 06:52.890
I would like to review the
appeal process for my officers.

06:55.980 --> 06:57.417
Figured.

06:57.460 --> 06:58.983
And do your detectives
gather evidence

06:59.027 --> 07:02.900
using a standard set
of diagrams and equations?

07:04.946 --> 07:06.556
Figured.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.776
- It's completely different.
- Not only cops play hunches.

07:08.819 --> 07:12.040
We do, too. And it is our hunch
the defense will highlight

07:12.083 --> 07:15.870
your detective's past missteps
and Kent will walk.

07:15.913 --> 07:17.959
It's not a hunch.
It's a blackballing.

07:18.002 --> 07:20.831
It's a hunch,
and one based on a set

07:20.875 --> 07:22.529
of well-known probabilities.

07:22.572 --> 07:25.923
Now, I'm not saying that
this is ideal by any stretch.

07:25.967 --> 07:28.099
Then why are you
here defending it?

07:28.143 --> 07:30.928
The D.A. is my boss.

07:30.972 --> 07:33.322
And, at my level,
my most senior partner.

07:33.365 --> 07:36.151
And I know
you understand partners.

07:39.197 --> 07:42.113
Did you tell him
he's dead wrong?

07:42.157 --> 07:44.464
Does Lieutenant Gormley
walk in here

07:44.507 --> 07:46.466
and tell you you're dead wrong?

07:46.509 --> 07:49.599
Or does he offer
diverging viewpoints?

07:49.643 --> 07:51.166
You're lawyering me.
I hate that.

07:51.209 --> 07:54.169
You're patronizing me.
I hate that.

07:56.171 --> 07:58.695
So, what, you're just
following orders?

07:58.739 --> 08:00.088
Is that it?

08:01.132 --> 08:03.613
I'm doing my job.

08:15.712 --> 08:18.976
No one has eyes on Angelica yet,
but every cop in the city

08:19.020 --> 08:20.978
has a photo of her
in their smartphone.

08:21.022 --> 08:22.806
Well, while you were away,
I laid my eyes

08:22.850 --> 08:24.939
on this from a security camera

08:24.982 --> 08:26.331
outside the restaurant.

08:26.375 --> 08:27.681
You recognize this mook?

08:27.724 --> 08:29.073
Should I?

08:29.117 --> 08:31.728
Well, I ran his mug
through facial recognition.

08:31.772 --> 08:34.601
You're looking at
one Paulie DeMarco.

08:34.644 --> 08:36.558
The enforcer
of the Grazioso family?Yes.

08:36.602 --> 08:38.996
He entered the restaurant
ten minutes before closing.

08:39.039 --> 08:41.216
He exited five minutes
after closing.

08:41.259 --> 08:43.523
Vic's time of death
falls in that window.

08:43.566 --> 08:45.220
That's one hell
of a coincidence.

08:45.263 --> 08:47.744
Sure is. Looks like
our family squabble's

08:47.788 --> 08:49.659
turned into a mob execution.

08:56.927 --> 08:59.539
Everyone step back, please.
Step back.

08:59.582 --> 09:00.844
- Take a step back. Get back.
- Hey, out of the way.

09:00.888 --> 09:02.367
- You, out of the way now.
- Out of the way.

09:02.411 --> 09:04.456
How you doing in there? Sir?

09:04.500 --> 09:06.067
Sir?

09:10.245 --> 09:12.334
He's been shot
in the back of the head.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.119
Did anyone see
a passenger?

09:15.163 --> 09:17.165
Did anyone see a passenger?

09:17.208 --> 09:20.037
- Anyone get out of this car? Hey.
- Get back, please. Take another step back.

09:20.081 --> 09:21.561
- Did you see anything?
- I didn't see anything.

09:21.604 --> 09:23.432
You didn't see anything?

09:23.475 --> 09:25.347
Did you see anything, sir?

09:25.390 --> 09:27.175
Come on.

09:29.090 --> 09:31.483
You sure
this is a good idea?

09:31.527 --> 09:34.791
Yes. If the Graziosos were
involved, this guy will know.

09:34.835 --> 09:36.706
Hey!

09:36.750 --> 09:39.404
Vincent, how you been?

09:39.448 --> 09:42.582
So much for this
being my lucky day.

09:42.625 --> 09:43.887
You're not happy to see us?

09:43.931 --> 09:45.323
Happy?

09:45.367 --> 09:47.717
Last time I hung out
with you two at the courthouse,

09:47.761 --> 09:49.632
I almost got my ass shot off.

09:49.676 --> 09:51.373
You have some dangerous friends.

09:51.416 --> 09:53.462
I'm officially retired.

09:53.505 --> 09:55.333
Well, you're still a very
popular guy, I see.

09:57.292 --> 09:59.076
I'm a people person.
What the hell do you want?

09:59.120 --> 10:00.600
We want to know
what you know about

10:00.643 --> 10:02.253
Lorenzo Aspromonte
getting popped.

10:02.297 --> 10:04.125
Tragic.

10:04.168 --> 10:06.736
The best veal Parmesan in
the city.-

10:06.780 --> 10:08.216
The man's dead,
and you're making jokes?

10:08.259 --> 10:10.871
We all got to die
sometimes, cupcake.

10:10.914 --> 10:12.437
It's DetectiveCupcake.

10:12.481 --> 10:14.657
We all got to die sometime,
but this guy had help.

10:15.876 --> 10:17.573
So why don't you tell me
why Paulie DeMarco

10:17.617 --> 10:19.140
paid a visit to the deceased.

10:19.183 --> 10:21.838
Who? Like I said,
I'm retired. Okay?

10:21.882 --> 10:24.275
It's a status I maintain

10:24.319 --> 10:26.103
by keeping my mouth shut.

10:26.147 --> 10:28.410
Look at that.

10:28.453 --> 10:29.541
Hello?

10:30.847 --> 10:32.153
You don't say.
You want to put a hundred

10:32.196 --> 10:34.329
on Angry Dan in the fifth?

10:35.373 --> 10:37.811
You got it.
You were saying?

10:37.854 --> 10:39.247
The wrong number.

10:39.290 --> 10:40.814
Bookmaking is illegal, Vincent.

10:40.857 --> 10:43.468
Which we'll be willing to
overlook if you'll talk to us

10:43.512 --> 10:45.340
right now.

10:47.429 --> 10:48.952
Look,

10:48.996 --> 10:53.304
Aspromonte paid protection
to the Graziosos.

10:53.348 --> 10:55.742
They raised the price.

10:55.785 --> 10:58.440
He wouldn't pay.So it was a hit?

10:58.483 --> 11:00.311
Let's say they ordered
a little takeout.

11:00.355 --> 11:01.661
Aspromonte's daughter

11:01.704 --> 11:03.706
was there that night.
Now she's disappeared.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.577
It's a smart move.

11:05.621 --> 11:07.928
If she saw her old man
getting whacked,

11:07.971 --> 11:11.932
they are coming after her
for sure, 100%.

11:20.984 --> 11:23.247
We appreciate you
coming in, Detective.

11:23.291 --> 11:26.250
You guys looking to toss some
of my other collars now?

11:26.294 --> 11:29.384
I can understand
why you're upset.

11:29.427 --> 11:31.560
We work this perp night and day
for weeks,

11:31.603 --> 11:33.301
take him down,
get a full confession.

11:33.344 --> 11:34.519
Then you guys won't charge him.

11:34.563 --> 11:35.869
Why the hell
would I be upset?

11:35.912 --> 11:37.609
You did good work, Detective.

11:37.653 --> 11:38.959
Then why is Kent about to walk?

11:39.002 --> 11:42.049
People v. Robert Yancy.

11:42.092 --> 11:43.790
Sexual assault two years ago.

11:43.833 --> 11:44.965
What about it?

11:45.008 --> 11:46.793
You got a confession
out of the accused.

11:46.836 --> 11:49.491
It was later thrown out
at trial.

11:49.534 --> 11:51.493
That's 'cause Yancy's
low-life lawyer claimed

11:51.536 --> 11:53.451
I didn't Mirandize
him-- which I did--

11:53.495 --> 11:54.757
and Judge Hamacker bought it.

11:54.801 --> 11:56.454
Hamacker comes
from Legal Aid.

11:56.498 --> 11:57.717
Doesn't trust cops.

11:58.587 --> 11:59.980
Just saying.

12:00.023 --> 12:01.546
Point being, Kent's confession

12:01.590 --> 12:04.985
could be called into question
based on that prior case.

12:05.028 --> 12:06.813
Kent's confession is rock solid.

12:06.856 --> 12:08.553
I'm afraid
that's a chance we can't take.

12:08.597 --> 12:10.338
Can't or won't?

12:16.387 --> 12:18.650
I've got friends in this office.

12:18.694 --> 12:21.392
I respect what you do.

12:21.436 --> 12:24.613
But when Brian Kent robs and
assaults his next victim--

12:24.656 --> 12:28.225
and he will--
that's on you guys.

12:35.232 --> 12:38.105
An NYPD boycott
of the Manhattan D.A.'s office

12:38.148 --> 12:39.454
will turn this city upside down.

12:39.497 --> 12:41.282
Not my circus, not my monkeys.

12:41.325 --> 12:42.892
It'll be everyone's circus.

12:42.936 --> 12:44.720
Then let the D.A.
flush that damn

12:44.764 --> 12:45.852
naughty list of his...Blacklist.

12:45.895 --> 12:48.202
Exactly. And until then,

12:48.245 --> 12:51.553
officers will continue to
make arrests as warranted,

12:51.596 --> 12:53.903
but offer no further
cooperation.

12:53.947 --> 12:55.731
No follow-up investigations?

12:55.775 --> 12:58.386
Let the D.A.'s
investigators handle that.

12:58.429 --> 12:59.779
For the entire borough

12:59.822 --> 13:02.042
- of Manhattan?
- It'll send a message, all right.

13:02.085 --> 13:03.565
Time for those guys
to be reminded

13:03.608 --> 13:06.220
that their jobs depend on cops.

13:06.263 --> 13:07.656
Yeah. Let's see how they like it

13:07.699 --> 13:09.919
when their precious
conviction rate drops 20 points.

13:09.963 --> 13:12.617
- You played this card last year for a day.
- And my message was received.

13:12.661 --> 13:14.489
And the result was chaos.

13:14.532 --> 13:16.621
What if this goes on
for a week, a month?

13:16.665 --> 13:18.710
They started it.
Only they can put it out.

13:18.754 --> 13:20.625
This amounts
to a declaration of war.

13:20.669 --> 13:22.671
No, it does not!

13:23.933 --> 13:27.067
This is about me standing
behind my people.

13:29.721 --> 13:33.377
But maybe it's worth reaching
out to the D.A. one more time.

13:33.421 --> 13:36.424
If I can't move my own daughter
on this, who canI move?

13:36.467 --> 13:39.035
You got a name and number,
I'm on it. Give it to me.

13:39.079 --> 13:42.473
They think they can treat cops
like perps and get away with it?

13:42.517 --> 13:45.041
Time for a fastball
under the chin.

13:45.085 --> 13:47.261
Except this isn't
a damn baseball game, Sid.

13:47.304 --> 13:50.873
It's the criminal justice system
in the city that we serve.

13:50.917 --> 13:53.049
Nice metaphor, though.Thank you, Abigail.

13:53.093 --> 13:54.877
At least consider
the collateral damage.

13:54.921 --> 13:56.661
I have.
Some is unavoidable.

13:56.705 --> 13:59.882
Well, tell that to the judges,
public defenders,

13:59.926 --> 14:01.362
private attorneys
and support staff

14:01.405 --> 14:03.277
who will feel the brunt
of all this.

14:03.320 --> 14:05.845
Tell them
to call the D.A.'s office.

14:13.287 --> 14:15.115
Let's make this fast,
Detectives.

14:15.158 --> 14:16.856
Why?
You double-parked, Counselor?

14:16.899 --> 14:18.945
We're here as a courtesy.

14:18.988 --> 14:20.642
Well, judging from your client's
rap sheet,

14:20.685 --> 14:22.339
I wouldn't exactly
call him the courteous type.

14:22.383 --> 14:23.688
Go screw yourself.

14:23.732 --> 14:25.168
Case in point.

14:25.212 --> 14:27.301
Yup. Here's the deal.
We know that

14:27.344 --> 14:30.173
Lorenzo Aspromonte had a beef
with the Graziosos

14:30.217 --> 14:31.479
over protection payments.

14:31.522 --> 14:32.523
News to me.

14:32.567 --> 14:34.482
Right, so you just
happened upon

14:34.525 --> 14:36.832
the crime scene right around the
time the vic was murdered?

14:36.876 --> 14:37.877
Don't answer that.

14:39.139 --> 14:40.444
You got something
to hide, Paulie?

14:40.488 --> 14:41.706
I went in for a drink.

14:41.750 --> 14:42.882
That's against the law now?

14:42.925 --> 14:44.709
No, but homicide is.

14:44.753 --> 14:47.930
Unless you have my client
on tape committing a crime,

14:47.974 --> 14:49.366
or some other evidence...

14:49.410 --> 14:51.107
Some other evidence
like an eyewitness perhaps?

14:51.151 --> 14:52.630
How about the victim's daughter?

14:54.719 --> 14:56.852
Sure hope she's okay.Shut up, Paulie.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.158
Here's the deal.

14:58.201 --> 15:01.074
You let us bring the girl
in here unharmed,

15:01.117 --> 15:02.597
we'll talk to the A.D.A.

15:02.640 --> 15:04.904
about reducing the charges
to manslaughter.

15:17.655 --> 15:18.961
Hey.

15:19.005 --> 15:20.354
Hi.

15:21.485 --> 15:22.704
You got food?

15:22.747 --> 15:24.706
Yeah.
I...

15:24.749 --> 15:26.577
made you salmon.

15:26.621 --> 15:27.709
You didn't have to do that.

15:27.752 --> 15:29.885
I owed you
after that steak sandwich.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.800
Remember when we used
to talk about stuff

15:31.843 --> 15:33.019
besides eating alone?

15:33.062 --> 15:35.673
I'm sorry we haven't
had much time lately.

15:35.717 --> 15:37.414
Got some time right now.

15:37.458 --> 15:40.026
I told Rachel I'd pick her up

15:40.069 --> 15:41.766
on my way in, and I...What?

15:41.810 --> 15:43.377
I know. I'm sorry.Fine.

15:43.420 --> 15:46.641
I'll just spend some quality
time here with my salmon.

15:48.251 --> 15:50.036
I promise
I'll make it up to you.

15:50.079 --> 15:51.602
Talk is cheap.

15:51.646 --> 15:54.214
Wait. Did you talk to Sergeant
McNichols when you got on?

15:54.257 --> 15:55.955
Yeah.She mention

15:55.998 --> 15:57.130
the decoy operation?

15:57.173 --> 15:58.870
Yeah, we talked about it.

15:58.914 --> 16:01.830
She say she
picked a driver?

16:01.873 --> 16:03.571
Yeah. I'm sorry.
You didn't get it.

16:03.614 --> 16:05.355
Damn.

16:07.314 --> 16:08.750
Tell me she didn't
go with Henderson.

16:08.793 --> 16:10.230
No.

16:10.273 --> 16:11.361
Dentzer?

16:11.405 --> 16:12.841
Me.

16:12.884 --> 16:15.931
You're kidding, right?

16:15.975 --> 16:18.064
I didn't volunteer for it,
but I was tagged.

16:18.107 --> 16:20.327
What was I supposed to say?

16:20.370 --> 16:22.242
How about "no"?How would I do that?

16:22.285 --> 16:26.028
Like this. "Thanks, Sarge,
but Officer Janko was the first

16:26.072 --> 16:27.464
"on the scene
of the last attack,

16:27.508 --> 16:28.813
"and it really got to her.

16:28.857 --> 16:30.293
"She is hungry for this perp,

16:30.337 --> 16:33.035
and she would like to take part
in making this collar."

16:33.079 --> 16:34.645
That steps on all kinds
of lines.

16:34.689 --> 16:36.952
Plus, only one of the vics
was female,

16:36.996 --> 16:39.607
so law of averages...You're being
overprotective.

16:39.650 --> 16:41.435
...says male,
so I got tagged to be

16:41.478 --> 16:43.089
in the decoy op, end of story.

16:43.132 --> 16:45.961
End of story says the guy
who ran to my rescue

16:46.005 --> 16:47.571
after that decoy
mission last year.

16:47.615 --> 16:50.052
I would have done the same thing
for any cop in that position.

16:50.096 --> 16:51.880
But it wasn't any cop,
it was me.

16:53.186 --> 16:55.275
I told you I don't need
a guardian angel.

16:55.318 --> 16:58.582
That's not what this is.
Once again, I was tagged.Yeah.

16:58.626 --> 17:01.890
And you could have tagged me.
You could have at least tried.

17:01.933 --> 17:03.370
Are you sure this isn't
about something else?

17:03.413 --> 17:05.372
I know what this is about.

17:05.415 --> 17:07.678
Do you?

17:21.170 --> 17:23.215
Hey. Did he budge?

17:23.259 --> 17:24.739
Not an inch.

17:24.781 --> 17:28.089
You told him Detective Andrews
is only on his list

17:28.134 --> 17:31.224
'cause a soft judge took
a skel's word over a cop's?

17:31.267 --> 17:33.008
Yup.
Well, what'd he say?

17:33.052 --> 17:35.054
He said that Brian Kent's
attorney could still

17:35.097 --> 17:38.405
use that ruling to
discredit this confession.

17:38.448 --> 17:40.581
There's no judge
gonna fall for that.

17:40.624 --> 17:43.366
I agree with you.
He doesn't.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.109
Does he know your old man's
about to return fire?

17:47.153 --> 17:48.241
Yeah.

17:48.284 --> 17:51.113
- And we're sticking to our guns.
- "We"?

17:51.157 --> 17:52.245
Yeah, we.

17:52.288 --> 17:54.464
As in this district
attorney's office.

17:54.508 --> 17:57.554
So you're for this?I'm for us acting

17:57.598 --> 17:59.252
a little more like cops
around here.

17:59.295 --> 18:02.777
And for having your partner's
back, even if you have doubts,

18:02.820 --> 18:04.213
even if it makes you a target.

18:04.257 --> 18:06.215
Otherwise, we're just
going along to get along,

18:06.259 --> 18:08.913
and... you end up nowhere.

18:08.957 --> 18:10.437
And I wasn't raised that way.

18:10.480 --> 18:11.916
You say that to your old man?

18:11.960 --> 18:15.006
No, I didn't have to.
He brought me up that way.

18:18.358 --> 18:19.663
So, you got a plan?

18:19.707 --> 18:22.318
I've got a result
that I would like to see,

18:22.362 --> 18:24.364
which is Kent going to trial.

18:24.407 --> 18:25.365
But no plan.

18:25.408 --> 18:27.802
Not yet.
You know,

18:27.845 --> 18:29.151
there's one thing I thought of.

18:29.195 --> 18:30.892
If, 
Detective Andrews' partner

18:30.935 --> 18:32.633
had taken the confession,

18:32.676 --> 18:34.983
we'd probably be good to go.

18:35.026 --> 18:36.985
But she took the confession,
so here we are.

18:37.028 --> 18:38.726
Right.

18:40.684 --> 18:42.643
Right.

18:47.865 --> 18:50.172
The presser for your
boycott announcement

18:50.216 --> 18:51.913
is set for 9:00 a.m. Monday.

18:51.956 --> 18:54.002
Do you have my remarks?No.

18:55.743 --> 18:57.527
I'd like to have them
for the weekend.

18:57.571 --> 18:58.528
I can't write them.

18:58.572 --> 19:01.792
But... it's your job.

19:01.836 --> 19:03.620
Well, it's also
part of my job

19:03.664 --> 19:05.535
to take your point of view

19:05.579 --> 19:08.408
and translate it
into logic and language

19:08.451 --> 19:10.540
that accurately reflects it,

19:10.584 --> 19:13.413
but renders it fit
for public consumption.

19:13.456 --> 19:17.025
And I... I can't
do that here.

19:17.068 --> 19:18.418
Because?

19:18.461 --> 19:22.030
Because I think you're
compounding their mistake

19:22.073 --> 19:24.554
with one of your own,
and I can't just

19:24.598 --> 19:27.166
hold my nose and roll it out.

19:28.210 --> 19:29.385
Watch it.

19:29.429 --> 19:31.561
Another part of what I do is,

19:31.605 --> 19:33.520
when your logic
goes off the rails,

19:33.563 --> 19:34.695
I point it out.

19:34.738 --> 19:38.960
Yet, here I sit,

19:39.003 --> 19:40.918
and there you stand.

19:40.962 --> 19:43.791
Meaning what?
You're the PC and I'm not?

19:43.834 --> 19:46.228
Meaning what's this about?

19:48.187 --> 19:52.234
The fallibility of any
and every man,

19:52.278 --> 19:54.410
including you.

19:58.109 --> 20:00.895
Your gut has got the best
of your brain in this.

20:02.505 --> 20:06.422
Yes, the D.A. putting cops
on a blacklist is outrageous.

20:06.466 --> 20:09.077
But you're letting him
goad you

20:09.120 --> 20:12.559
into a reckless,
disproportionate response.

20:12.602 --> 20:15.823
He's destroying the careers
of good officers,

20:15.866 --> 20:17.259
and letting bad guys walk.

20:17.303 --> 20:19.261
Yeah, I'm goaded, all right.

20:19.305 --> 20:20.393
Then you're handing him
the keys,

20:20.436 --> 20:21.916
and riding in the back
of this thing.

20:21.959 --> 20:25.528
But my job is to
protect this department.

20:25.572 --> 20:28.923
It's also your job
to protect the public.

20:28.966 --> 20:32.709
Yes, releasing perps
like Brian Kent is dead wrong.

20:32.753 --> 20:34.755
But pulling cops
from the court system

20:34.798 --> 20:37.714
is putting the public
at the exact same risk.

20:37.758 --> 20:42.371
Bad guys skating 'cause
you and the D.A. are fighting.

20:42.415 --> 20:44.721
Are you done?

20:46.767 --> 20:49.987
'Cause if you are,
I kind of hoped

20:50.031 --> 20:54.165
you'd have something
constructive to offer.

20:54.209 --> 20:56.472
Maybe I do.

20:59.562 --> 21:02.739
Give me a buzz when you're
ready to listen to reason.

21:02.783 --> 21:05.002
But I'm ready.

21:05.046 --> 21:06.482
No, I know you.

21:06.526 --> 21:09.050
Gonna take a couple hours
to figure out

21:09.093 --> 21:12.183
where you could've shut me down
and missed your openings.

21:12.227 --> 21:14.621
See you around 5:00.

21:21.715 --> 21:23.543
So I did
what I had to do, Dad.

21:23.586 --> 21:25.632
Yeah, which got you tossed
from the game

21:25.675 --> 21:27.068
and suspended
from the team.

21:27.111 --> 21:28.156
Dad, it's one game.

21:29.200 --> 21:30.419
What happened?Sean was

21:30.463 --> 21:32.421
pitching a masterpiece,
but then he decides

21:32.465 --> 21:34.684
to plunk the opposing pitcher
and he gets the boot.

21:35.555 --> 21:36.860
Accidents happen.

21:36.904 --> 21:38.384
Who said it was
an accident?

21:38.427 --> 21:40.603
It was an accident,
right, Sean?

21:40.647 --> 21:41.822
Or it was payback.

21:41.865 --> 21:43.258
It's also part of the game.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.782
- Well, which was it?
- Beaning another guy

21:45.826 --> 21:47.654
is part of the game?It is when he hit

21:47.697 --> 21:49.220
Terry O'Brien
the inning before.

21:49.264 --> 21:51.048
Which actually could've been
an accident.

21:51.092 --> 21:53.137
Yeah, right after Terry hit
a grand slam off of him

21:53.181 --> 21:54.269
his last time up?

21:54.313 --> 21:55.966
Definitely sounds
like an accident.

21:56.010 --> 21:57.359
Well, that goes to motive.

21:57.403 --> 21:59.622
- I'm with Eddie.
- Sean could've really hurt someone.

21:59.666 --> 22:01.494
I hit him in the back,
right between the numbers--

22:01.537 --> 22:02.799
the way it's done.

22:02.843 --> 22:03.800
Between the...What?

22:03.844 --> 22:04.932
Who even taught
you this?

22:04.975 --> 22:06.673
'Cause it sure
as hell wasn't me.

22:06.716 --> 22:08.370
Yeah. Who thinks like that?

22:13.984 --> 22:15.421
Could've figured that.

22:15.464 --> 22:16.378
Seriously, Mom?

22:16.422 --> 22:18.989
Look, if Sean is gonna pitch,

22:19.033 --> 22:20.991
he needs to know
the responsibilities.

22:21.035 --> 22:23.472
And one being
you protect your teammates.

22:23.516 --> 22:24.386
Thank you!

22:24.430 --> 22:25.561
- Good job.
- I agree.

22:25.605 --> 22:27.041
Every game's got
unwritten rules.

22:27.084 --> 22:28.521
You're up 20
in the fourth quarter,

22:28.564 --> 22:30.218
got to pull
the starters.

22:30.261 --> 22:31.959
And you don't steal bases
when the game's out of reach.

22:32.002 --> 22:32.873
- Exactly.
- But those rules

22:32.916 --> 22:34.701
are about good sportsmanship.

22:34.744 --> 22:37.051
And what if you accidentally hit
that kid in the head?

22:37.094 --> 22:38.139
They wear helmets.He was wearing

22:38.182 --> 22:39.880
a helmet.

22:39.923 --> 22:40.968
If you're looking for

22:41.011 --> 22:42.535
a good example of sportsmanship,

22:42.578 --> 22:44.058
you probably don't want
to be looking

22:44.101 --> 22:45.886
in the direction
of your aunt, okay?

22:45.929 --> 22:47.191
She's not
the best role model.

22:47.235 --> 22:48.192
You always told me she was

22:48.236 --> 22:49.237
the best athlete
in the family.

22:49.280 --> 22:51.892
Best athlete,
not best role model.

22:51.935 --> 22:53.850
Also, by far,
the most cutthroat.

22:53.894 --> 22:55.896
And the sorest loser
you ever saw.

22:57.071 --> 22:58.725
You know who's not angry
when they lose?

22:58.768 --> 23:00.248
People who are used to losing.

23:00.291 --> 23:01.902
So, losers.

23:01.945 --> 23:02.903
Where'd you get that,

23:02.946 --> 23:03.991
G. Gordon Liddy?

23:04.034 --> 23:06.385
Much closer to home.

23:06.428 --> 23:08.387
Not true.

23:08.430 --> 23:09.779
Yeah, true.

23:10.824 --> 23:12.434
Sunday dinner.

23:12.478 --> 23:14.393
I'm aware.

23:27.362 --> 23:28.929
How's the game?

23:30.060 --> 23:31.671
I'm glad
I don't bet on these things.

23:32.498 --> 23:33.629
Anymore.

23:37.546 --> 23:39.853
Are you all set
for the decoy operation?

23:39.896 --> 23:40.680
Yeah.

23:40.723 --> 23:41.855
Kind of a different deal

23:41.898 --> 23:43.726
now that this guy's
moved up to homicide.

23:43.770 --> 23:45.598
Same M.O. Should
be pretty routine.

23:45.641 --> 23:48.514
Aren't you the one that told me
to never underestimate a perp?

23:48.557 --> 23:50.211
I'm not.

23:50.254 --> 23:51.517
You sure?Follow van

23:51.560 --> 23:52.692
will be tracking my location.

23:52.735 --> 23:54.171
Any trouble, they'll
just jump right in.

23:54.215 --> 23:56.957
Why can't you just take him down
when he gets in the cab?

23:57.000 --> 23:58.698
Then you can connect the gun

23:58.741 --> 24:00.264
to the driver he killed.Well, if he uses

24:00.308 --> 24:02.353
a different gun or
none of the vics can pick him

24:02.397 --> 24:03.964
out of a lineup,
we'd be out of luck.

24:05.182 --> 24:07.446
Decoy op's the smart play.

24:08.969 --> 24:11.798
Are you still pissed
that this is me instead of you?

24:11.841 --> 24:13.800
No.

24:13.843 --> 24:16.977
Good, because neither one of us
ever had a choice in this.

24:17.020 --> 24:19.370
We're cops
who take orders,

24:19.414 --> 24:22.548
which is what we're gonna be
as long as we're cops.

24:22.591 --> 24:24.767
That's the job.

24:30.773 --> 24:32.993
All I'm saying is,

24:33.036 --> 24:34.864
as your former
partner,

24:34.908 --> 24:36.518
don't...

24:36.562 --> 24:39.042
don't play the hero.

24:46.833 --> 24:48.965
Stay on the rail, Manny.

24:49.009 --> 24:52.142
Stay on the rail.
Watch-- watch number three!

24:52.186 --> 24:54.144
- What...?
- Come on!

24:54.188 --> 24:56.364
- Yeah!
- Damn. You had the race.

24:56.407 --> 24:58.888
I thought the house
always wins, Vincent.

24:58.932 --> 25:01.630
You're a funny guy.

25:01.674 --> 25:05.547
You know, you two are, you're
like something I stepped in.

25:05.591 --> 25:06.896
We need to talk.

25:06.940 --> 25:08.376
Forget about it.

25:08.419 --> 25:09.856
There's eyes and ears
all over the joint.

25:09.899 --> 25:14.077
And you coming here,
you-you-you jam me up.

25:14.121 --> 25:17.037
You understand?We need to locate
Angelica Aspromonte.

25:17.080 --> 25:18.734
You wanted to be a cop.

25:18.778 --> 25:20.257
This is an innocent girl
whose dad

25:20.301 --> 25:21.737
was shot right in front of her.

25:21.781 --> 25:23.913
Which ain't right.

25:23.957 --> 25:26.263
I grant you that. But right now,

25:26.307 --> 25:27.830
if she's smart,

25:27.874 --> 25:29.223
she stays put.

25:29.266 --> 25:30.920
You think the Graziosos
are gonna let her do that?

25:30.964 --> 25:34.228
I take bets on horses, okay?
End of story.

25:34.271 --> 25:39.102
You hustled for the Graziosos,
but you never hurt anyone.

25:39.146 --> 25:42.105
Which tells me
you have a conscience.

25:42.149 --> 25:43.890
Don't bet on it.

25:43.933 --> 25:47.937
And you have a granddaughter,
too, don't you, Vincent?

25:49.460 --> 25:51.637
What does my granddaughter
have to do with it?

25:51.680 --> 25:55.466
Your granddaughter
is the same age as Angelica.

26:04.345 --> 26:05.520
Come on.

26:14.398 --> 26:17.184
When a hit goes bad,

26:17.227 --> 26:19.839
the one who screwed up
has got to make it right.

26:19.882 --> 26:22.015
Paulie DeMarco?Yeah.

26:22.058 --> 26:25.409
And this one went real bad,
all right?

26:25.453 --> 26:27.890
The idiot was supposed
to threaten Aspromonte,

26:27.934 --> 26:29.718
not kill him.

26:29.762 --> 26:31.981
On top of which,
he leaves a witness.

26:32.025 --> 26:35.768
Now Paulie needs to whack her
before he gets whacked himself.

26:35.811 --> 26:38.945
It's not good for you,
'cause Paulie knows

26:38.988 --> 26:41.295
the neighborhood
like the back of his hand.

26:41.338 --> 26:44.080
And with his ass on the line,

26:44.124 --> 26:47.257
there's no way you're gonna find
the girl before he does.

27:09.105 --> 27:10.977
Hey, come here.

27:11.020 --> 27:13.240
My God.Come here.

27:13.283 --> 27:14.589
Please don't hurt me.

27:14.633 --> 27:16.722
Where is she?

27:16.765 --> 27:17.810
There's no one else here.

27:17.853 --> 27:19.855
You look like a smart kid.

27:20.856 --> 27:22.379
Be smart.

27:23.859 --> 27:26.340
Leave her alone.
I'll go with you.

27:26.383 --> 27:27.515
Angelica, no.Another witness?

27:27.558 --> 27:28.951
I don't think so.

27:28.995 --> 27:32.041
Who wants to go first?

27:44.880 --> 27:47.013
You talk, you're dead.

27:47.056 --> 27:50.190
You don't shut your mouth,
you're dead.

27:50.233 --> 27:52.192
You guys are gonna be okay.Thank you.

27:52.235 --> 27:54.890
Don't thank us.
Thank Paulie here.

27:54.934 --> 27:57.588
We've been tailing you
all day, genius.

27:57.632 --> 27:59.286
Never would have found
Angelica without you.

27:59.329 --> 28:01.767
Come on.

28:10.776 --> 28:13.082
Look,

28:13.126 --> 28:16.869
I want that bastard to pay
for what he did to my dad.

28:16.912 --> 28:18.261
I know you do.

28:18.305 --> 28:20.655
And if you want to make him pay,
all you got to do

28:20.699 --> 28:22.222
is just tell me what you saw.

28:22.265 --> 28:25.225
But if I do that,
those guys will come after me.

28:25.268 --> 28:28.271
No. Angelica, look,
we can protect you.

28:28.315 --> 28:30.621
I give you my word
we can keep you safe.

28:30.665 --> 28:32.101
You just got to trust me.

28:32.145 --> 28:34.408
I promise.
We'll keep you safe.

28:34.451 --> 28:38.760
I'm sorry, Detective.
I just... I can't.

28:40.327 --> 28:41.807
Okay.

28:43.809 --> 28:46.072
All right. You got him?

28:46.115 --> 28:47.334
Yeah.

28:47.377 --> 28:48.988
Bring him in.

28:49.031 --> 28:51.294
Before you go, Angelica,
I would like you

28:51.338 --> 28:53.949
to meet someone who understands
what you're going through.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.170
Vincent, thanks for coming in.

28:57.213 --> 28:59.215
Yeah, your partner didn't
give me that much choice.

28:59.259 --> 29:02.523
She's a tough cookie.
Angelica, this is Vincent Rella.

29:02.566 --> 29:04.264
My condolences
for your loss, dear.

29:04.307 --> 29:06.570
- Thank you.
- A few years back...

29:06.614 --> 29:09.225
Vincent, testified
against the Graziosos himself,

29:09.269 --> 29:12.751
and as you can see, he, 
he lived to tell about it.

29:12.794 --> 29:15.797
Yeah, it was a little bit
more complicated than that.

29:15.841 --> 29:18.104
Yes, but we did keep you safe,
didn't we, Vincent?

29:18.147 --> 29:22.325
And we can keep
Angelica safe, too,

29:22.369 --> 29:24.023
if you cooperate
with us, Angelica.

29:24.066 --> 29:28.375
I knew there was a problem
with the Graziosos.

29:28.418 --> 29:30.551
My dad wouldn't
talk to me about it.

29:30.594 --> 29:32.858
He didn't want me to have
anything to do with it.

29:32.901 --> 29:35.077
He was watching out
for you, dear.That's right.

29:35.121 --> 29:36.426
He was
protecting you,

29:36.470 --> 29:39.212
and this is your chance
to pay him back.

29:41.736 --> 29:45.871
If you were in my place,
Mr. Rella, what would you do?

29:47.611 --> 29:50.266
I knew your dad very well.

29:50.310 --> 29:54.227
He was so, so proud of you.

29:54.270 --> 29:55.663
And he would want you

29:55.706 --> 29:57.491
to do the right thing.

29:57.534 --> 29:59.188
Yes, he would.

29:59.232 --> 30:02.844
So listen very carefully
to what I'm about to tell you.

30:02.888 --> 30:04.759
Forget what you saw

30:04.803 --> 30:06.805
and walk away.

30:08.154 --> 30:09.720
What the hell
are you doing, Vincent?

30:09.764 --> 30:11.026
You can't go telling her that.

30:11.070 --> 30:13.463
Your dad, his life is over.

30:13.507 --> 30:15.901
You have a long life
ahead of you.

30:15.944 --> 30:17.467
Walk away.

30:41.143 --> 30:44.407
You can step out now.
I got it.

30:44.451 --> 30:45.887
How's it hanging, Brian?

30:45.931 --> 30:47.584
The hell do you want?Watch your mouth,

30:47.628 --> 30:50.587
tough guy.
I ain't in no wheelchair.

30:50.631 --> 30:52.894
Plus, I'm here
to do you a favor.

30:52.938 --> 30:55.288
Yeah, right.

30:55.331 --> 30:56.811
Since you owned up
to what you did,

30:56.855 --> 30:59.074
my boss may be willing
to drop a few counts

30:59.118 --> 31:01.076
from the indictment,
not that you deserve it.

31:01.120 --> 31:03.252
So what's the holdup?

31:03.296 --> 31:05.472
We need you to repeat
your confession.

31:05.515 --> 31:07.082
I already told
the cops everything.

31:07.126 --> 31:09.911
She needs to confirm
the details are consistent.

31:09.955 --> 31:11.391
What do you got, a hot date?

31:11.434 --> 31:13.610
Where's a piece of garbage
like you going?

31:13.654 --> 31:15.438
Go to hell.

31:15.482 --> 31:17.701
You guys got everything
you need.

31:17.745 --> 31:20.530
Fine with me.

31:20.574 --> 31:24.099
You should rot in jail
for what you did anyway.

31:24.143 --> 31:25.840
Okay.

31:30.889 --> 31:32.716
Okay.

31:43.075 --> 31:44.946
Hello, Mr. Kent.
I'm A.D.A. Erin Reagan.

31:44.990 --> 31:46.339
You ready to get started?

31:46.382 --> 31:48.167
Let's just get this over with.

31:50.256 --> 31:52.258
We appreciate your cooperation.

31:58.307 --> 32:00.135
Still east on 28th.

32:00.179 --> 32:01.528
Copy that. We've got you.

32:01.571 --> 32:03.095
Our officer on the street

32:03.138 --> 32:04.966
reported a subject fitting
the description

32:05.010 --> 32:06.446
up ahead on your right.

32:06.489 --> 32:08.143
Male, white.
Gray sweatshirt, dark jeans.

32:08.187 --> 32:09.971
Copy that.

32:10.015 --> 32:11.016
I got him.

32:13.714 --> 32:14.845
Here we go.

32:14.889 --> 32:16.804
Copy. We're falling back.

32:29.121 --> 32:30.252
Where to?

32:30.296 --> 32:32.907
Just drive.

32:42.047 --> 32:43.962
Just take him down, Jamie.

32:47.748 --> 32:49.837
You got an address for me?

32:52.013 --> 32:54.015
Hey. W-What the hell
are you doing?

32:54.059 --> 32:55.234
Shut up

32:55.277 --> 32:56.670
and keep driving.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.803
We lost the feed
from the cab.

32:59.847 --> 33:01.762
We lost him. Let's move in.

34:00.125 --> 34:02.170
Eddie, what...

34:02.214 --> 34:03.954
What the hell are
you doing here?Are you okay?

34:03.998 --> 34:05.782
Are you okay?I'm all right.

34:05.826 --> 34:06.827
What the hell
are you doing here?

34:06.870 --> 34:08.002
I used the Find My Phone app.

34:08.045 --> 34:10.091
You followed me?

34:10.135 --> 34:13.964
Hey! Why don't you
say "thank you"?

34:26.803 --> 34:28.762
This is a big mistake.

34:28.804 --> 34:30.893
Yeah, well, we wouldn't
even have been here

34:30.938 --> 34:32.286
if you would've
told Angelica

34:32.331 --> 34:34.507
to testify
like you were supposed to.She asked

34:34.550 --> 34:36.117
my opinion.
I ain't gonna lie to her.

34:36.161 --> 34:37.987
Right. And your opinion
is she'd be safer

34:38.032 --> 34:40.252
on the streets than she would
be in witness protection, right?

34:40.295 --> 34:41.469
Let me tell you something.

34:41.514 --> 34:44.125
I did five years
in Nowhere, Nebraska, okay?

34:44.168 --> 34:47.520
The air was beautiful, clean,
everybody smiling--

34:47.563 --> 34:48.998
I wanted to hang myself.

34:49.043 --> 34:50.958
I couldn't do that
to my granddaughter.

34:51.001 --> 34:53.221
And witness protection was
Angelica's best chance

34:53.264 --> 34:54.570
to stay alive.
Yeah.

34:54.614 --> 34:56.833
Right. Separated
from her family,

34:56.877 --> 34:58.183
her friends,
everybody she loves.

34:58.226 --> 34:59.575
What kind of life is that?

34:59.619 --> 35:01.360
And you know it.You do realize

35:01.403 --> 35:03.318
that even if
DeMarco walks,

35:03.362 --> 35:06.452
there's a good chance he's
gonna go after Angelica anyway,

35:06.495 --> 35:07.844
'cause of what she saw.

35:07.888 --> 35:11.021
If she keeps her mouth shut,
she gets left alone.

35:11.065 --> 35:13.328
And DeMarco gets
away with murder.

35:13.372 --> 35:16.331
You're a typical cop.

35:16.375 --> 35:18.028
"Get the collar."
Doesn't... don't matter

35:18.072 --> 35:19.334
what kind of damage
you do.

35:19.378 --> 35:21.728
Here they come. Come on.

35:35.307 --> 35:37.700
Keeping strange company
these days, Vincent.

35:37.744 --> 35:40.181
Hi, Gino.That's 'cause he's
trying to save your ass.

35:41.791 --> 35:45.143
Gino, there's a possibility
your name's gonna come up

35:45.186 --> 35:47.449
for ordering the hit
on Aspromonte.

35:47.493 --> 35:49.016
There was no hit.

35:49.059 --> 35:51.279
- I told him.
- No, you didn't order the hit.

35:51.323 --> 35:53.629
But you did send
DeMarco over there

35:53.673 --> 35:55.283
to threaten Aspromonte,

35:55.327 --> 35:57.546
which means you could still be
looking at second degree murder.

35:57.590 --> 35:59.766
No way Paulie brings up my name.

35:59.809 --> 36:01.724
Maybe Paulie won't
bring up your name...

36:01.768 --> 36:04.336
but who's to say I won't find
somebody else who will?

36:05.424 --> 36:07.077
So why are we here?

36:07.121 --> 36:08.905
'Cause I want something
from you.

36:08.949 --> 36:10.603
That's the reason
that I set up

36:10.646 --> 36:12.735
the meeting, so you can
have an arrangement.

36:12.779 --> 36:14.128
I'm listening.

36:14.172 --> 36:16.565
You let Angelica
I.D. Paulie DeMarco

36:16.609 --> 36:18.088
with no repercussions...

36:18.132 --> 36:19.960
I'll talk to the D.A.,

36:20.003 --> 36:23.224
tell him you had
no involvement in any of this.

36:23.268 --> 36:25.444
You skate.
Everybody wins.

36:25.487 --> 36:28.403
Can I trust this guy
to hold up his end?

36:28.447 --> 36:30.100
He just wants DeMarco.

36:30.144 --> 36:33.756
Let her take him down
and walk away.

36:33.800 --> 36:35.193
He will hold up his end.

36:35.236 --> 36:36.281
You got my word.

36:40.285 --> 36:42.852
Yeah, okay.
You got a deal.

36:44.680 --> 36:46.943
Hey, Vincent.

36:46.987 --> 36:48.075
Yeah?

36:48.118 --> 36:50.338
You did good.

36:50.382 --> 36:52.949
Thank you, Gino.

36:52.993 --> 36:55.082
He's right, you know.
You did good.

36:55.125 --> 36:58.259
Yeah. I'm getting too old
for these shenanigans.

36:58.303 --> 37:00.435
Where you headed?Drop me near the track.

37:00.479 --> 37:03.264
You do realize gambling's
for suckers, right?

37:03.308 --> 37:06.136
Tomorrow. The third.

37:06.180 --> 37:08.748
Lucky Julian.
You'll thank me.

37:08.791 --> 37:10.532
Right.

37:10.576 --> 37:13.056
All right, put 20 on it
for me. Let's go.All right.

37:16.451 --> 37:18.627
I'm not sure I want to eat
this guy's cooking.

37:18.671 --> 37:21.326
Yeah. I'd like
to see him at least

37:21.369 --> 37:24.198
wash his hands first.What's he making,
lobster a la hipster?

37:31.466 --> 37:33.947
That's the second time
you saved my life.

37:33.990 --> 37:35.383
So thank you.

37:35.427 --> 37:36.993
Pleasure's all mine.

37:37.037 --> 37:39.605
It can't become a thing, though.Okay.

37:40.693 --> 37:44.697
I'll just look the
other way next time.

37:44.740 --> 37:46.046
What I mean is...

37:46.089 --> 37:47.743
I know what you mean.

37:47.787 --> 37:50.746
What you mean is...

37:50.790 --> 37:53.096
if we accept the
risks to ourselves,

37:53.140 --> 37:55.273
we have to accept the
risks to each other.

37:56.839 --> 37:58.841
Well, yeah, you just put it
better than I could have.

37:58.885 --> 38:00.974
But from another angle?

38:01.017 --> 38:02.889
Okay.

38:02.932 --> 38:04.934
There are worse
things in the world

38:04.978 --> 38:07.110
than having a
guardian angel.

38:39.229 --> 38:41.319
Brian Kent is going to trial.

38:43.408 --> 38:45.410
Good news.

38:45.453 --> 38:46.802
That's all you've got?

38:46.846 --> 38:50.023
I hear stuff before
people think I've heard it.

38:50.066 --> 38:53.374
Luckily, he was gracious enough
to repeat his confession.

38:53.418 --> 38:54.941
With a trial bureau chief.

38:54.984 --> 38:57.770
In exchange for
potential leniency...

38:57.813 --> 38:59.815
which he will not receive.

38:59.859 --> 39:02.557
Also good news.

39:12.959 --> 39:15.091
It shouldn't
have come to this.

39:18.791 --> 39:20.575
It won't be
the last time

39:20.619 --> 39:24.362
if this blacklist
stays in place.

39:24.405 --> 39:26.276
The D.A.'s office
is battening down

39:26.320 --> 39:28.409
the hatches
for the NYPD boycott.

39:28.453 --> 39:30.019
Mine, too.

39:30.977 --> 39:34.023
Unless... this.

39:38.593 --> 39:41.074
What is this?The PC's

39:41.117 --> 39:43.119
naughty list.

39:43.163 --> 39:46.296
Every A.D.A. who's
screwed up a prosecution

39:46.340 --> 39:50.344
in the last five years,
in the opinion of the NYPD.

39:54.304 --> 39:55.915
You've got the D.A. himself
on it.

39:55.958 --> 39:58.178
Top of the list.

39:59.962 --> 40:02.356
Am I on this list?

40:02.400 --> 40:04.140
What if you were?

40:04.184 --> 40:06.012
Depending on the case cited,

40:06.055 --> 40:09.319
I might look at it as a
black mark or a badge of honor.

40:11.191 --> 40:12.540
You are tough.

40:12.584 --> 40:14.455
Am I on the list?

40:14.499 --> 40:16.326
No.

40:16.370 --> 40:19.460
If this thing was leaked,
it would cause World War III.

40:19.504 --> 40:22.289
Do you want to tell him?
Or should I?

40:22.332 --> 40:24.552
I will.

40:24.596 --> 40:25.901
What do you think he'll do?

40:25.945 --> 40:28.077
Scorch the earth.

40:28.121 --> 40:29.992
Clear the room,
slam some doors,

40:30.036 --> 40:31.864
and then think about it.

40:31.907 --> 40:33.735
Remind you of anyone you know?

40:35.781 --> 40:37.435
No.

40:37.478 --> 40:41.177
If we tear up our list,
will you tear up yours?

40:41.221 --> 40:42.701
Yes.

40:53.233 --> 40:55.801
You realize
this time's different?

41:01.110 --> 41:03.199
Yes, I do.

41:03.243 --> 41:06.159
I didn't like that list
any more than you did.

41:06.202 --> 41:08.857
Not even the idea.

41:08.901 --> 41:11.991
But it's not my job
to correct the D.A.

41:12.034 --> 41:15.690
Or undermine him
or make excuses for him.

41:15.734 --> 41:18.519
It's my job to stand with him.

41:20.913 --> 41:22.784
Now, I love this.

41:22.828 --> 41:26.135
I was raised in this Copland.

41:26.179 --> 41:30.488
But my duty... is to my office.

41:33.447 --> 41:35.884
You understand that?

41:35.928 --> 41:38.452
I understand.

41:42.151 --> 41:44.502
Can't say that I like it.

41:44.545 --> 41:47.026
But I understand.
