00:01.240 --> 00:03.940
Previously on "rescue me... "

00:03.980 --> 00:05.710
I was hoping that-

00:08.740 --> 00:10.470
will you marry me?

00:12.010 --> 00:13.120
Are you serious?

00:13.170 --> 00:15.370
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm serious.

00:15.400 --> 00:18.000
Yes!
Yes, I will marry you, franco!Yes!

00:18.040 --> 00:19.510
Daddy!

00:19.560 --> 00:21.790
Oh, my god.
Look at you.

00:21.830 --> 00:22.650
I grew.

00:22.700 --> 00:24.600
She wants you in her life.

00:24.640 --> 00:26.180
We need you.

00:26.220 --> 00:29.010
Alicia, I kind of...
I met someone.

00:29.050 --> 00:30.540
It's serious.

00:30.600 --> 00:33.080
What does that mean, like a week or something?

00:33.120 --> 00:35.290
I gave her a ring.

00:35.330 --> 00:39.020
You can use this to start up your girl's college education.

00:39.060 --> 00:40.950
You can beef up your retirement fund.

00:40.990 --> 00:44.230
You can maybe take some pressure off you and janet so you can,

00:44.270 --> 00:46.900
I don't know, work things out...
for once.

00:46.950 --> 00:51.260
I mean, look, this money, it solves a lot of problems for all of us.

00:51.290 --> 00:52.940
All of us?

00:53.170 --> 00:54.870
I want you to give me that baby.

00:54.900 --> 00:58.230
Talking about us, you know...
I...

00:59.080 --> 01:00.850
I just think that we're...

01:00.900 --> 01:02.050
you know, done.

01:02.080 --> 01:05.010
All rightie then.
Ok. So...

01:05.060 --> 01:07.740
- I'll see you.
- Yeah. Great.

01:07.770 --> 01:09.500
That...

01:09.540 --> 01:15.520
plan that you offered up about, you know, my kid...

01:15.950 --> 01:16.990
Yeah?

01:17.020 --> 01:19.100
That still stand?

01:19.120 --> 01:21.230
Yes.

01:21.270 --> 01:23.590
By all means, yes.

01:23.620 --> 01:25.400
- Tommy.
- What?

01:25.960 --> 01:27.490
Are we going to...

01:27.520 --> 01:29.460
are we going to do this?

01:29.490 --> 01:31.720
No. Nah, I can't do it.

01:31.760 --> 01:34.150
I'll talk to you later.

02:04.900 --> 02:06.720
Where is he?

02:10.050 --> 02:16.740
I did what I thought was best for everybody involved,

02:16.780 --> 02:17.900
especially him.

02:17.940 --> 02:19.980
What is that supposed to mean?

02:24.360 --> 02:26.020
Huh?

02:27.160 --> 02:29.750
What?
An orphanage?

02:29.780 --> 02:32.870
What?You dropped him by the side of the road?What?

02:32.900 --> 02:35.630
Yeah, I left him by the side of the road.

02:39.770 --> 02:42.200
I gave him to an orphanage.

02:47.600 --> 02:50.040
I dropped him in the river.

02:52.090 --> 02:54.220
Sheila gave us half a million bucks, ok?

02:54.250 --> 02:54.910
What?

02:54.950 --> 02:55.760
- Hey!

02:55.810 --> 02:58.240
Listen to me, ok?
Listen. Listen.

02:58.290 --> 03:01.050
500 grand. That's how much it costs for 2 kids to-ow!

03:01.090 --> 03:02.670
- Go to school.

03:02.710 --> 03:03.830
Let go.

03:06.540 --> 03:07.660
Listen to me.

03:07.700 --> 03:08.950
You didn't want that baby.

03:08.990 --> 03:10.200
You never wanted that baby!

03:10.230 --> 03:13.690
Don't you put it back on me!
You sold my baby!

03:17.090 --> 03:18.590
Let go!

03:20.910 --> 03:22.470
Jesus christ!

03:29.300 --> 03:30.790

03:35.180 --> 03:37.490
He is my goddamn son,

03:37.530 --> 03:39.630
and he came from me.

03:39.660 --> 03:41.410
I decide what happens to him.

03:41.440 --> 03:43.510
I decide who raises him.

03:43.530 --> 03:44.970
Not you.

03:44.990 --> 03:46.680
Me.

03:47.050 --> 03:51.840
And I don't want that filthy whore's goddamn hands on my son.

03:52.390 --> 03:55.060
Ok, this is it.

03:59.210 --> 04:02.670
Oh, god.

04:03.940 --> 04:06.260

04:37.930 --> 04:40.330
This will be, like, a natural break for everybody.

04:40.370 --> 04:42.000
And just, you know...

04:54.150 --> 04:55.560
Mommy.

04:55.590 --> 04:58.040
- Yeah?
- What's daddy doing?

04:58.070 --> 05:00.190
I don't know.

05:00.230 --> 05:02.020
Move!

05:04.200 --> 05:06.120
Move!

05:07.700 --> 05:09.680

05:09.730 --> 05:12.030
I will run your sorry ass over.

05:17.850 --> 05:20.230
- Mom, what did you just do?
- Oh, my god.

05:20.260 --> 05:21.720
What's wrong with you?
What did you do?

05:21.760 --> 05:22.810
Where's daddy?

05:22.870 --> 05:24.230
Ok, honey.
Just...

05:24.260 --> 05:25.000
Just calm down.

05:25.020 --> 05:26.940

Ok?Just shh.

Oh, my god.

Oh, my god.

05:29.670 --> 05:31.470

05:32.640 --> 05:34.120

05:34.750 --> 05:37.300
Tommy, you ok?

05:38.640 --> 05:40.230
Jesus.

05:41.700 --> 05:43.270
You could have killed me.

05:43.300 --> 05:45.450
Look, I wasn't going fast enough.

05:46.190 --> 05:47.940
Yeah.

Hey.
Hey, guys.

08:40.400 --> 08:41.960
You cheat.
I bet you cheated.

08:42.070 --> 08:43.400
What are you talking about?

08:43.429 --> 08:45.770
A straight.
A straight flush.

08:52.730 --> 08:54.910
Hello?

09:09.730 --> 09:11.600
Hey.

09:15.330 --> 09:17.440
One thing.

09:17.480 --> 09:23.420
I asked you to do one simple thing, and you screw that up.

09:23.440 --> 09:25.590
Jesus, tommy.

09:25.610 --> 09:29.030
Drop the baby in the river.

09:29.060 --> 09:31.270
How hard is that?
Huh?

09:31.310 --> 09:33.260
You know what?

09:33.300 --> 09:36.540
I'm your brother, and you should have been looking out for me.

09:36.580 --> 09:37.770
Johnny-

09:37.810 --> 09:39.580
That night at the garden,

09:39.630 --> 09:41.460
you came down to my dressing room,

09:41.500 --> 09:44.040
and you said,

09:44.080 --> 09:46.260
"sorry, kid. Tonight's not your night. "

09:46.300 --> 09:48.780
- What night, johnny?
- Not my night.

09:49.840 --> 09:52.240
I could have torn wilson apart.

09:52.670 --> 09:55.300
I could have been somebody, charlie,

09:55.340 --> 09:57.610
instead of a bum...

09:57.640 --> 09:59.710
which is what I am.

10:02.750 --> 10:04.710
No, johnny.

10:49.990 --> 10:52.300
You have a massive problem, pal.

10:52.330 --> 10:59.210
You don't give a shit about anybody but yoself.

10:59.260 --> 11:00.930
Nobody but yourself.

11:03.560 --> 11:07.130

11:12.080 --> 11:14.510

11:14.540 --> 11:16.190

11:17.550 --> 11:19.510

- Nobody.

11:20.170 --> 11:21.330
- Got to go.

11:21.370 --> 11:23.380
No, no, no. Bullshit.
Don't start. Don't start.

11:23.410 --> 11:25.920
We tried to warn you, tommy.
We tried to speak.

11:25.940 --> 11:29.310
We tried to make sense to you so you'd make sense of this, but it didn't work.

11:29.340 --> 11:31.860
- I'm listening.
- That's ok. Listen.

11:31.890 --> 11:34.420
I'm gonna wash my hands of all of it.

11:34.455 --> 11:35.960
What are those guys doing?

11:35.990 --> 11:37.640
You're my older brother, charlie.

11:37.660 --> 11:38.640
You should have looked out for me.

11:38.660 --> 11:39.800

11:39.820 --> 11:41.410

Don't do that.

16:19.620 --> 16:21.160
What's going on?

16:23.740 --> 16:25.900
Jesus christ.
What happened to you?

16:27.860 --> 16:30.480
Holy shit.

16:31.880 --> 16:33.810
What is this?

16:33.840 --> 16:38.640
Janet and I got into a little bit of a thing, you know.

16:39.980 --> 16:42.720
- You been drinking or-
- No, no. Jesus.

16:43.860 --> 16:45.260
No.

16:51.370 --> 16:53.650
Listen, I know your marriage is, you know,

16:53.680 --> 16:54.900
kind of going south, but-

16:54.930 --> 16:57.890
No, no, no, no. This isn't the marriage, no.

16:57.930 --> 16:59.880
No, no. She had-

16:59.940 --> 17:02.180
that was about the marriage, the table in the kitchen.

17:02.200 --> 17:04.089
And then she split.

17:04.119 --> 17:05.660
And then, this, you know...

17:05.680 --> 17:08.150
this fire broke out in the bedroom.

17:08.180 --> 17:10.050
So I tried to go in the...

17:10.940 --> 17:13.810
main door, and that was-

17:13.839 --> 17:14.990
I couldn't get in there. So

17:15.030 --> 17:17.380
then I wanted to go through here to try, you know,

17:17.420 --> 17:20.109
to put it out, but as it ends up, once I got

17:20.150 --> 17:22.730
through the wall, there was...

17:22.760 --> 17:24.520
no fire.

17:28.020 --> 17:29.820
Time for a meeting.

17:29.830 --> 17:31.160
Yeah.

17:31.870 --> 17:35.420
Let me just put the ax away.

17:45.330 --> 17:47.320
- 62 truck.
- Yeah, it's me.

17:47.350 --> 17:48.140
Hey, where are you?

17:48.180 --> 17:50.190
- I'm not gonna make it in today.
- Well, what happened?

17:50.230 --> 17:51.710
- Who's that?
- Tommy.

17:51.740 --> 17:53.160
I got a situation here.

17:53.190 --> 17:55.690
- What kind of situation?
- A bad situation.

17:55.730 --> 17:57.960
Well, how bad?
What happened?

17:57.990 --> 18:00.650
- I'm bleeding.
- Bleeding from where?

18:01.420 --> 18:02.990
- My head, my ear.
- Wait.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.990
- She didn't stab you, did she?
- Jesus.

18:05.030 --> 18:07.020
She didn't stab me.
She hit me.

18:07.040 --> 18:08.390
- Hit you with what?
- I don't know.

18:08.430 --> 18:10.220
Something...
steel.

18:10.240 --> 18:11.960
- A baseball bat?
- No, it-

18:12.000 --> 18:15.210
A spatula?A gun?
A teakettle?

18:15.250 --> 18:17.580
Look, just do me a favor.
Just cover for me, all right?

18:17.610 --> 18:18.830
I'll call you when I can.

18:27.120 --> 18:28.980
Hey, when's tommy coming back?

18:29.010 --> 18:30.650
Why?

18:30.680 --> 18:32.890
Because it's not like him to call in sick.

18:32.910 --> 18:34.450
You know, whenever I do, he calls me a pussy.

18:34.480 --> 18:35.700
Well, number one, you are a pussy.

18:35.740 --> 18:38.560
Number two, he's fine. A little stomach virus.

18:40.700 --> 18:41.950
Hey, did you hear what happened to gavin?

18:41.980 --> 18:42.730
No.
What?

18:42.760 --> 18:44.030
His wife stabbed him.

18:44.070 --> 18:46.110
- You got to be shitting me.
- No.

18:46.130 --> 18:47.840
I got it right from the horse's mouth.

18:47.860 --> 18:50.050
Not the actual horse, but the horse next to the horse.

18:50.070 --> 18:51.150
It's solid info.

18:51.180 --> 18:53.600
They're going at it toe to toe about one thing or another.

18:53.640 --> 18:56.230
She ends up plunging a paring knife into his back.

18:56.260 --> 18:58.170
Put him in the goddamn hospital.

18:58.190 --> 19:00.020
All right.
Copy that.

19:00.040 --> 19:03.750
Turn around, nils. Looks like we're gonna be able to watch "guiding light" after all.

19:03.780 --> 19:05.310
What the hell is this knucklehead doing?

19:05.340 --> 19:07.140
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

19:10.820 --> 19:12.830
- Oh, jesus christ!
- You guys all right?

19:12.860 --> 19:14.295
Yeah.
I'm good.

19:14.330 --> 19:16.790
All right.
Let's get to work.

19:22.340 --> 19:23.680
All right.
Ma'am. Ma'am.

19:23.710 --> 19:25.570
Please.
Please don't move. Ok?

19:25.620 --> 19:26.740
Please don't move.
You're gonna be fine.

19:26.770 --> 19:27.920
- I'm ok.
- All right. Guys.

19:27.970 --> 19:30.720
Guys, she's in shock.
We're going to need an ambulance here right away.

19:30.760 --> 19:32.020
We're going to need to stabilize you, ok?

19:32.050 --> 19:33.880
Hey, nils, you want to grab a backboard.
Let's move the rig up.

19:33.900 --> 19:35.430
Sir, are you ok?

19:36.980 --> 19:38.920
- Tomato soup?
- Homemade.

19:38.950 --> 19:41.460
Oh, it's delicious.
Any left?

19:41.490 --> 19:43.100
I can't believe there weren't any casualties.

19:43.130 --> 19:44.710
I wouldn't go that far.

19:49.200 --> 19:50.940
- You ok?
- Come on. Come on.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.570
Take your time.

19:52.600 --> 19:53.930
Take your time.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.500
Hey.

19:57.520 --> 19:59.280
You want to take my car?

19:59.310 --> 20:01.010
Nah.
I got to go to work after.

20:01.040 --> 20:02.110
I'll drop you off at work.

20:02.140 --> 20:03.840
No, no, no.
I'm good.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.320
I don't think so.

20:06.050 --> 20:07.520
Oh.

20:09.020 --> 20:10.770
Wow.

20:10.800 --> 20:12.150
Cool.

20:13.380 --> 20:14.950
Your car's getting towed, and all you can say is,

20:14.980 --> 20:16.790
"oh. Wow. Cool"?

20:16.810 --> 20:18.900
That truck was way too nice for me, man.

20:18.930 --> 20:20.420
Yeah.

20:21.310 --> 20:23.050
You sure you're not drinking?

20:23.510 --> 20:25.270
Where are you parked?

20:30.520 --> 20:32.590
- You good?
- I'm good, man.

20:33.370 --> 20:34.540
New digs.

20:34.570 --> 20:36.630
It's nice.
Everything looks brand-new.

20:36.650 --> 20:37.770
It is brand-new.

20:37.800 --> 20:39.260
I got it with the insurance money.

20:39.280 --> 20:41.580
Oh, right.
Sorry about that.

20:41.600 --> 20:44.070
Hey, you know what?Out with the old, in with the new, right?

20:44.090 --> 20:47.440
I mean, you could say I did you a favor, right?

20:48.110 --> 20:50.150
Or not.
Not really.

20:50.930 --> 20:54.060
Oh, you know what?
I also have these.

20:54.090 --> 20:55.350
I forgot...

20:55.380 --> 20:57.260
forgot I had them.

20:57.290 --> 20:59.060
Thanks.

20:59.090 --> 21:00.760
Sure.

21:02.240 --> 21:06.120
Hey, you want to watch the metties?
I got a new flat-screen.

21:06.140 --> 21:08.780
- It's high-def.
- I can'T.I got a thing.

21:09.570 --> 21:11.010
So you'll come by later?

21:11.040 --> 21:13.270
No. I'm actually gonna crash at my own place tonight.

21:13.340 --> 21:14.470
Oh.
Maggie's back?

21:14.500 --> 21:15.880
No.
I got a spare key.

21:15.910 --> 21:18.550
So I'm just gonna go there and wait for her to come home.

21:18.580 --> 21:21.000
- Are you sure that's a good idea?
- No, it's not.

21:21.030 --> 21:24.160
But, you know, the candle she still burns, right?

21:24.200 --> 21:25.510
Yeah.

21:25.540 --> 21:27.350
Well, hey, good luck with that.

21:27.380 --> 21:28.830
Yeah.
Thanks, man.

21:28.860 --> 21:30.880
So, you know, you'll give me a call?

21:30.920 --> 21:32.810
Yes, I will call you.
And you know what?

21:32.850 --> 21:34.440
We'll come, and I'll hang another time, and

21:34.470 --> 21:36.470
I won't set the place on fire.

21:36.980 --> 21:37.960
Ok, man.
And you know what?

21:38.020 --> 21:40.200
Sorry again about that.
That was...

21:40.240 --> 21:42.070
I didn't, you know...
that was...

21:52.570 --> 21:54.540
- Yo, ace.
- Hey.

21:54.570 --> 21:55.670
How's the wound?

21:55.700 --> 21:59.400
- How's the what?
- Where is it?Back?Stomach?

21:59.420 --> 22:00.080
What?

22:00.120 --> 22:03.980
A guy in my neighborhood, his girlfriend opened him up, right, all up in here.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.550
The wound was so big, they were going to give him 75 stitches.

22:06.580 --> 22:08.740
Instead, they gave him 8 staples.

22:08.760 --> 22:10.480
Staples is the way to go.

22:11.500 --> 22:13.530
- Staples?
- Most definitely.

22:13.560 --> 22:16.220
I- I don't know what you're talking about, but...

22:16.260 --> 22:18.220
Ok. Ok.
I get it.

22:18.250 --> 22:20.000
No problem.
Forget about it. Never mind.

22:20.030 --> 22:21.170
- You get it?
- Yeah, I get it.

22:21.210 --> 22:22.230
I got to go floss.

22:22.270 --> 22:24.200
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

22:27.190 --> 22:28.660
What are you looking at?

22:28.680 --> 22:30.350
Nothing.

22:30.370 --> 22:31.950
Were you just looking at my ass?

22:31.970 --> 22:33.720
Don't flatter yourself.

22:34.160 --> 22:36.440
Hey, by the way, feinberg is, uh...

22:36.460 --> 22:37.770
What are you looking at now?

22:37.790 --> 22:39.750
Feinberg wants to see you.
Nothing.

22:49.360 --> 22:50.910
Come on in.

22:51.970 --> 22:53.450
- Hey, tommy.
- Hey, chief.

22:53.480 --> 22:55.680
Come on in.
You ok?

22:56.190 --> 22:57.170
Yeah.
I'M...

22:57.200 --> 23:01.680
you know, a little banged-up, but otherwise I'm, you know...

23:01.710 --> 23:03.160
Didn't expect you in so soon.

23:03.190 --> 23:05.320
- You're a quick healer.
- Yeah.

23:06.690 --> 23:07.870
So...

23:07.890 --> 23:10.570
you and your wife definitely split, huh?

23:12.060 --> 23:15.390
yeah. I mean, I try not to talk about it at work

23:15.430 --> 23:17.700
because I obsess about it.

23:17.740 --> 23:20.450
So I just try to keep it private.

23:21.020 --> 23:22.630
Well...

23:28.840 --> 23:31.160
I feel like a putz, but, uh...

23:31.530 --> 23:33.260
what the hell.

23:33.790 --> 23:36.240
I have a daughter named beth.

23:36.280 --> 23:37.800
- Yeah?
- Very attractive girl.

23:37.820 --> 23:39.030
Yeah?

23:39.680 --> 23:42.150
And it turns out you're her type.

23:43.220 --> 23:45.350
I'm coming out of a really bad situation.

23:45.390 --> 23:48.680
I'm a recovering alcoholic with some pretty...

23:49.020 --> 23:51.770
severe black rage issues,

23:51.790 --> 23:53.400
and my wife's been telling me- and she's right-

23:53.430 --> 23:56.830
I've been very self-centered and stuff over the years.

23:56.850 --> 23:59.870
I don't really think I'M...
I'm about to get divorced.

23:59.890 --> 24:02.270
I'm not really anybody's type right now.

24:02.290 --> 24:04.350
Well, she didn't see any of that, you know.

24:04.370 --> 24:09.610
I mean, she saw a lean, lanky, sandy-haired bad-boy type.

24:09.640 --> 24:11.880
Anyway, that's what she told her mother. The two of them,

24:11.930 --> 24:14.870
they've been on my ass ever since, you know.

24:14.900 --> 24:18.690
Do me a favor, would you, please, and take her out, hmm?

24:19.300 --> 24:20.720
I'll pay.

24:20.750 --> 24:21.990
Chief, chief.

24:22.010 --> 24:24.700
I'm not even playing the field right now.

24:24.730 --> 24:26.110
What field?
Come on.

24:26.130 --> 24:27.890
One dinner...

24:27.920 --> 24:30.160
at a reasonably priced place.

24:30.190 --> 24:31.690
- Chief-
- Listen.

24:31.720 --> 24:33.650
Hey.
She's a very attractive girl.

24:33.690 --> 24:34.710
I'm sure she is, sir.

24:34.740 --> 24:36.350
Look at her.
Here.

24:36.390 --> 24:39.300
I didn't really...
see anything.

24:39.320 --> 24:41.330
I saw, like, a nose and some blond hair.

24:41.350 --> 24:44.240
And she gets compliments on both of those all the time.

24:44.270 --> 24:45.370
I'm sure she does.

24:45.400 --> 24:47.850
Sir, I just... I got to tell you, I'm just not ready for-

24:47.880 --> 24:50.200
Gavin, you know, you're a vain, selfish,

24:50.250 --> 24:55.670
risk-taking son of a bitch, but do this one thing for me, one thing,

24:55.720 --> 25:00.910
and I'll give you a wide berth, let you do your own thing.

25:00.940 --> 25:02.640
What do you say?

25:02.660 --> 25:04.440
Chief, you're making me feel like you're my

25:04.510 --> 25:06.690
dad and I'm getting ready to go to the junior prom.

25:06.720 --> 25:09.470
Hey, well, whatever works for you.

25:09.500 --> 25:10.650
Come on.

25:10.680 --> 25:13.260
- Think about it.
- Ok, I'll think about it, ok?

25:13.280 --> 25:14.800
I'll just...

25:14.820 --> 25:16.780
think a little.
All right?

25:16.810 --> 25:19.540
Because of the thing and...

25:19.580 --> 25:21.010
all right.

25:24.310 --> 25:26.400
- Oh, you're still here.
- Yeah.

25:26.430 --> 25:27.840
You want some coffee or something?

25:27.890 --> 25:32.250
No. I just thought maybe we could get a chance to talk without keela around.

25:32.270 --> 25:34.150
How long before her and donald get back from walking the dog?

25:34.170 --> 25:35.100
Ah, who knows?

25:35.130 --> 25:38.110
You know, donald has this idea that the dog is getting fat,

25:38.180 --> 25:39.570
so she has to have more exercise.

25:39.590 --> 25:42.960
I think actually donald's the one that's getting a little fat and- Mmm.

25:54.140 --> 25:55.980
That's a nice conversation.

25:56.770 --> 25:58.070
I missed you.

25:58.100 --> 25:59.590
I missed being with you.

25:59.610 --> 26:01.170
- We had something, right?
- Oh, yeah.

26:01.190 --> 26:03.090
- So it's over, then?
- What?

26:03.110 --> 26:05.060
With your fiance.

26:05.080 --> 26:06.480
I don't know, you know.

26:06.500 --> 26:08.500
That could be a big mistake for me, marriage.

26:08.520 --> 26:10.120
I'm not really the type.

26:11.120 --> 26:12.760
- Let's go to your bedroom, baby.
- Ok.

26:12.790 --> 26:15.510
- Can you just do one little thing for me?
- Yes, baby. Anything.

26:15.540 --> 26:17.150
Ok. Well, just call your fiance,

26:17.190 --> 26:20.040
tell her we're about to have sex, you won't be home till tomorrow,

26:20.070 --> 26:22.020
and maybe mention the little thing about, you know,

26:22.050 --> 26:23.900
that marriage isn't your thing.

26:23.930 --> 26:26.410
- You're joking, right?
- No.

26:26.440 --> 26:30.220
In fact, you know, my stomach would be a little upset right now

26:30.260 --> 26:33.220
if it weren't for the fact that your predictability is

26:33.260 --> 26:35.430
strangely comforting.

26:35.470 --> 26:37.460
What do I look like to you?

26:37.490 --> 26:39.520
- Well, you look fantastic.
- No, I don't mean how do I look.

26:39.560 --> 26:40.660
I mean, what do I look like?

26:40.700 --> 26:42.620
Do you see a door when you look at me?

26:42.660 --> 26:45.740
A door that you're just going to go through to escape.

26:45.760 --> 26:49.880
You know, I'm not some random means of destruction to end your relationship

26:49.910 --> 26:51.470
because you don't have the balls to do it yourself.

26:51.510 --> 26:52.750
I'm not gonna be used that way.

26:52.780 --> 26:54.190
I'm not using you, alicia.
I love you.

26:54.240 --> 26:55.880
- Oh, don't say that.
- I do. I love you.

26:55.920 --> 26:57.270
You don't know what you're talking about.

26:57.310 --> 26:59.240
So wait a second. Now you're saying what I feel isn't real?

26:59.270 --> 27:02.200
Not what you feel. I mean, you have to make some choices.

27:02.230 --> 27:04.670
I mean, how long have you known this woman?

27:04.690 --> 27:05.930
- A year.
- A year?

27:05.970 --> 27:06.270
Yeah.

27:06.290 --> 27:07.880
And how many times have you cheated on her?

27:07.900 --> 27:09.440
I've never cheated on her.
You'd be the first.

27:09.470 --> 27:10.500
Oh.
I'm flattered.

27:10.540 --> 27:13.320
And she's the first one that you've given a ring to?

27:13.340 --> 27:15.770
- Yeah.
- And why did you do that?

27:16.880 --> 27:18.730
I don't know.
You know, she might be the one.

27:18.760 --> 27:22.480
Well, then why are you trying to get me up into my bedroom?

27:23.400 --> 27:24.880
Well...

27:24.910 --> 27:27.300
oh, sit down.
Just sit down.

27:34.840 --> 27:36.670
You love her.

27:36.700 --> 27:37.970
Yeah.

27:37.990 --> 27:42.290
And you think you want to spend the rest of your life with her.

27:42.830 --> 27:44.340
I think so.

27:44.360 --> 27:46.500
But you're really scared.

27:46.530 --> 27:48.020
Why?

27:50.720 --> 27:52.710
I don't know.
I mean, what if it doesn't work out?

27:52.740 --> 27:54.670
What if I screw it up?

27:54.690 --> 27:56.860
Like you're doing right now.

27:59.490 --> 28:02.880
Hey, be brave.

28:02.910 --> 28:04.750
Don't screw it up.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.850
Go home.

28:07.470 --> 28:09.890
There's a lady waiting for you.

28:12.630 --> 28:14.030
Yeah.

28:14.820 --> 28:16.050
Thank you.

28:16.080 --> 28:17.900
You're welcome.

28:18.410 --> 28:19.750
I'm sorry.

28:19.780 --> 28:21.320
Hey.

28:31.880 --> 28:33.650
I do love you, you know.

28:34.090 --> 28:38.310
I know, and you should after what I just did for you.

28:38.330 --> 28:40.580
I love you, too.

28:40.600 --> 28:42.860
But get out of here.
Don't give me that contrite look.

28:42.890 --> 28:44.730
You know how it turns me on.
Just go.

28:44.750 --> 28:46.220
All right.

28:53.890 --> 28:56.210
- Who said she shot him?
- Garrity.

28:56.240 --> 28:59.270
No, I didn'T.
I said she stabbed him.

28:59.310 --> 29:01.150
Mikey said that you said that she hit him with a gun.

29:01.170 --> 29:03.250
- Why would she hit him with a gun?
- I thought it was a teakettle.

29:03.270 --> 29:04.440
Maybe she didn't want to shoot him.

29:04.460 --> 29:06.210
You said she hit him with a baseball bat.

29:06.240 --> 29:07.990
How does a baseball bat become a gun?

29:08.020 --> 29:09.250
Is this a trick question?

29:09.650 --> 29:11.400
- Hi, guys.
- Ace.

29:11.920 --> 29:13.790
- What's going on?
- What's up?

29:14.900 --> 29:16.870
What you talking about?

29:16.890 --> 29:18.470
Just shooting the shit.

29:18.490 --> 29:19.800
Cool.

29:22.760 --> 29:26.790
You guys wouldn't have been talking about what went on between me and my wife, would you?

29:26.820 --> 29:28.230
- Nope.
- No.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.110
Ok.

29:43.140 --> 29:46.380
Let's get it out in the open once and for all.

29:46.400 --> 29:50.250
What exactly is it that you guys think went on between me and janet?

29:50.280 --> 29:53.450
Well, there are several schools of thought on this.

29:53.470 --> 29:54.210
Yeah.

29:54.240 --> 29:56.930
There are those who think that she stabbed you,

29:56.950 --> 30:00.060
and there are those who think that she hit you with a baseball bat,

30:00.110 --> 30:02.990
and mike thinks that she hit you with a gun.

30:03.020 --> 30:04.700
- What happened to the teakettle?
- What teakettle?

30:04.740 --> 30:06.150
Why would she hit me with a gun?

30:06.170 --> 30:07.670
Well, maybe she didn't have any bullets.

30:07.700 --> 30:09.050
Bullets.

30:09.080 --> 30:10.620
- I don't know.
- Ok.

30:10.650 --> 30:12.730
You know what?
She ran me over with a car.

30:12.760 --> 30:13.660
That's what she did.
Ok?

30:13.690 --> 30:15.850
After, you know, a pretty severe argument.

30:15.880 --> 30:17.440
Bullets?Jesus, you guys.
You know what?

30:17.480 --> 30:20.580
You're like a bunch of old hens sitting around.

30:20.610 --> 30:22.240
Christ!

30:26.230 --> 30:27.700
What's everybody getting so excited about?

30:27.740 --> 30:29.070
She ran him over with a car.

30:29.100 --> 30:30.840
It happens.

30:31.910 --> 30:33.870
- I'm in.
- All right.

30:34.920 --> 30:36.850
- Hey, you all right?
- Yeah.

30:37.420 --> 30:41.220
You know, you need to go out, maybe,

30:41.250 --> 30:43.350
god forbid, enjoy yourself a little bit.

30:43.380 --> 30:44.840
Yeah.

30:45.350 --> 30:47.330
But just, you know, if you're gonna do that,

30:47.370 --> 30:49.230
look both ways before you cross the street,

30:49.270 --> 30:51.630
especially in front of your house.

30:52.920 --> 30:54.740
I don't know, lou.

30:55.690 --> 30:58.390
I thought I was going to be fine with this whole

30:58.420 --> 31:00.440
"being on my own" thing, man.

31:01.020 --> 31:03.360
And I'm not.
Just...

31:03.920 --> 31:05.530
I don't know.

31:05.560 --> 31:07.930
You know, look, you're gonna be fine, you know.

31:07.950 --> 31:11.370
You just, you know, need to go off and, you know,

31:11.390 --> 31:15.000
have some fun, get out, maybe...

31:16.060 --> 31:18.510
maybe have a date, a dinner date.

31:18.530 --> 31:20.650
- Yeah.
- You, and...

31:20.680 --> 31:22.410
you know, some dinner, and, you know,

31:22.440 --> 31:26.140
a pretty girl, some candles,

31:26.180 --> 31:30.680
you know, lingerie, a box of wine.

31:33.230 --> 31:34.870
You know what?

31:36.090 --> 31:37.960
- You're right.
- Of course I am.

31:37.990 --> 31:39.750
Yeah.

31:40.780 --> 31:42.420
You know what I'm gonna do?

31:43.300 --> 31:44.750
I'm gonna call that volley chick.

31:44.780 --> 31:46.020
You don't have to-

31:46.050 --> 31:48.130
no- You said it to me.

31:48.160 --> 31:49.930
She has one of the greatest asses of all time, and of course,

31:49.960 --> 31:51.250
I just took it for granted.

31:51.290 --> 31:53.170
You know, tom, here's what I think.

31:53.200 --> 31:54.810
You know what I think?

31:54.850 --> 31:58.200
I think that you should forget about the past.

31:58.230 --> 32:01.690
I think you should forget about it, and you should start anew, you know.

32:01.720 --> 32:03.770
A brand-new chick.

32:03.800 --> 32:04.910
Why?

32:04.930 --> 32:09.660
Brand-new chick, brand-new set of problems, not to mention tits.

32:09.680 --> 32:12.700
Give me the phone.
Give me it. Give me it. The phone.

32:12.730 --> 32:14.190
- I don't buy it, pal.
- What?

32:14.220 --> 32:16.020
You're trying to get me to date the chief's daughter.

32:16.050 --> 32:16.810
- No.
- Yeah.

32:16.830 --> 32:18.570
- No.
- Yes. Yes.

32:18.610 --> 32:19.810
I am.
Yeah.

32:19.840 --> 32:21.340
Look, it's a career move, tom.

32:21.370 --> 32:23.810
Number one, you're taking out the chief's goddamn daughter.

32:23.840 --> 32:25.710
Number 2, you get my ass out of the fire.

32:25.740 --> 32:30.250
Number 3, you're winning very valuable brownie points with lou.

32:32.210 --> 32:36.790
Ok, look, I know I owe you 5 grand from the great lou depression of last year.

32:36.820 --> 32:42.830
You take her out, I'm gonna pay you back 7 grand.

32:43.990 --> 32:52.830
You take her out, I'm gonna give you back $7,500.

32:52.850 --> 32:54.110
I'm gonna give you-

32:54.130 --> 32:56.250
christ, tom, you know I don't have that kind of money!

32:56.270 --> 32:58.260
Why don't you say something?

32:58.290 --> 32:59.460
He asked you first, didn't he?

32:59.490 --> 33:00.130
- No.
- Yes.

33:00.170 --> 33:00.660
- No.
- Yes.

33:00.700 --> 33:02.900
Yeah, I knew.
I knew. Yeah.

33:02.940 --> 33:05.240
Why don't you take her out?

33:05.260 --> 33:09.300
Because, christ, tom, I just got off the goddamn sex express train.

33:09.320 --> 33:11.920
You could obviously use a blow job.

33:14.320 --> 33:16.160
She gives blow jobs?

33:16.180 --> 33:18.540
- She's jewish.
- So?

33:18.570 --> 33:21.810
Well, we all know that jew broads give, you know, great blow jobs.

33:21.840 --> 33:23.290
- We do?
- Yeah.

33:23.320 --> 33:26.150
It's common knowledge among jew and gentile alike.

33:26.160 --> 33:28.430
- You never dated a jew broad?
- Well, in high school.

33:28.470 --> 33:30.620
- She was only part jewish.
- Which part?

33:30.650 --> 33:32.480
Well, if what you're saying is true,

33:32.520 --> 33:34.590
it was obviously not the part from the neck up.

33:34.620 --> 33:36.130
Well, you got to trust me on this.

33:36.160 --> 33:38.850
Jew broads love to give head, and they love to give it easily.

33:38.880 --> 33:40.920
I don't know, lou.
Tapping the chief's daughter.

33:40.950 --> 33:43.220
- That's like career suicide.
- Tom, you're not tapping her.

33:43.250 --> 33:44.650
We're talking about a little blow job.

33:44.680 --> 33:46.860
Besides, he's practically throwing her at your feet.

33:46.890 --> 33:47.680
Yeah.

33:47.740 --> 33:49.020
And, you know, she's kind of hot.

33:49.040 --> 33:50.710
- You saw her?
- Yeah. I saw a picture.

33:50.780 --> 33:51.300
And?

33:51.320 --> 33:54.120
I saw it for, like, 2 seconds but, you know, she had...

33:54.140 --> 33:55.900
blond hair and...

33:55.930 --> 33:58.520
and a nose.
That's a good start.

34:03.400 --> 34:05.470
Maggie?

34:05.490 --> 34:07.510
Mags, is that you?

34:07.540 --> 34:09.260
- Oh, I'm sorry, buddy.
- Oh, hey, mick.

34:09.290 --> 34:10.199
The door was open.
I knocked.

34:10.219 --> 34:11.770
No, no.
Come on in, man.

34:11.810 --> 34:13.310
Any news?

34:13.350 --> 34:14.920
Well, um...

34:16.300 --> 34:18.350
she's set up in a motel for right now.

34:18.380 --> 34:20.699
A motel.
Ok. Where?

34:20.719 --> 34:22.710
She doesn't want to see you right now, sean,

34:22.780 --> 34:24.230
not in the condition she's in.

34:24.260 --> 34:25.440
Yeah?Well, I don't give a shit.

34:25.469 --> 34:26.670
I'm her husband, and I-

34:26.710 --> 34:28.840
Do me a favor, will you?Sit down for a second.

34:28.870 --> 34:30.150
Ok.

34:31.889 --> 34:33.860
Listen, um...

34:33.880 --> 34:37.360
the woman's got problems, you know, big...

34:37.389 --> 34:38.850
- big problems.
- Yeah.

34:38.870 --> 34:41.710
She's been an addict for as far back as I can remember.

34:44.159 --> 34:45.850
She needs an intervention.

34:45.889 --> 34:47.380
Yeah.

34:49.409 --> 34:52.199
Yeah.
What is that exactly?

34:53.730 --> 34:55.920
An intervention is, well...

34:56.429 --> 34:59.150
we sit her down in a roomful of people that love her.

34:59.180 --> 35:01.820
Everybody goes around the room and, you know,

35:01.880 --> 35:06.010
starts to share with her how much her addiction has affected them negatively.

35:06.040 --> 35:10.030
So I assume this goes on for, like, a couple days?

35:10.590 --> 35:13.440
Well, you know, we'd ask that you edit yourself a little.

35:13.500 --> 35:15.840
You know, just try and pick out the worst occurrences.

35:15.870 --> 35:18.780
Ok. Yeah.
So a few hours tops.

35:18.810 --> 35:20.960
- Yeah.
- We'll work on it.

35:20.990 --> 35:21.790
Ok.

35:21.830 --> 35:23.020
The most important thing is,

35:23.090 --> 35:26.010
you've got to tell her how her addiction has hurt you,

35:26.060 --> 35:28.050
and then you express your concern for her.

35:28.080 --> 35:32.600
Then at the end, you know, we offer to send her someplace to get some real help.

35:32.630 --> 35:35.550
But the key is, if she refuses to get help,

35:35.580 --> 35:38.370
I mean, you got to be prepared to stop enabling her.

35:38.390 --> 35:40.310
I mean, something's got to be at stake here,

35:40.380 --> 35:42.760
something you're willing to take away.

35:44.210 --> 35:45.770
Ok.

35:45.800 --> 35:47.370
Ok.

35:48.010 --> 35:49.690
- Ok. So...
- Yeah.

35:49.720 --> 35:53.810
Should she refuse, what would you be willing to take away?

35:55.340 --> 35:57.430
I guess I could stop bringing her aspirin in the morning,

35:57.460 --> 35:58.690
you know, when she's hung over.

35:58.720 --> 36:00.390
And I'd definitely stop making her manhattans.

36:00.420 --> 36:02.600
She's always complaining about I go too heavy on the sweet vermouth.

36:02.630 --> 36:04.560
I mean, come on.
I make a great manhattan.

36:04.580 --> 36:07.150
It's got to be something a little more substantial than that.

36:07.170 --> 36:09.360
You know, would you be willing, say,

36:09.410 --> 36:13.070
to not see her anymore, to end the marriage?

36:14.080 --> 36:15.070
Yeah-no.

36:15.100 --> 36:16.940
I already tried that.
That didn't really stick.

36:16.980 --> 36:18.510
That's because you probably didn't mean it.

36:18.530 --> 36:22.270
See, addicts have a way of knowing just how much they can get away with.

36:22.290 --> 36:24.580
You got to mean it.
All right?

36:24.600 --> 36:27.500
Can you say it and stick to it?

36:28.510 --> 36:30.800
No.
I don't think I can.

36:32.450 --> 36:34.290
Ok, then.

36:35.890 --> 36:37.310
I got an idea.

36:37.340 --> 36:39.750
Why don't you write down

36:39.780 --> 36:42.930
some of the things she's done that have hurt you.

36:42.960 --> 36:45.100
You see, you write it down.

36:45.140 --> 36:47.460
It might give you a little bit more perspective, you know.

36:47.490 --> 36:49.460
You got a few days.

36:49.490 --> 36:52.560
And believe me, you know, she needs to hear this stuff,

36:52.600 --> 36:53.940
or she's not going to get better.

36:53.960 --> 36:55.150
- Ok.
- All right?

36:55.190 --> 36:56.560
All right, man.
Good talk.

36:56.600 --> 36:57.600
Her life depends on it, buddy.

36:57.620 --> 36:59.180
- Thanks, mick.
- Hang in there, sean-O.

36:59.220 --> 37:00.720
Good to see you.

37:03.690 --> 37:05.610
Ok.

37:21.320 --> 37:23.730
- So...
- So...

37:23.760 --> 37:25.750
What do you do for work?

37:25.780 --> 37:27.120
- What do I do for work?
- Yeah.

37:27.160 --> 37:29.670
Right now, I'm working for

37:29.710 --> 37:31.670
children, inner-city, you know, kids.

37:31.710 --> 37:33.830
Oh.
That'S...

37:33.860 --> 37:34.720
teaching them or...

37:34.760 --> 37:37.330
Yeah, I like to teach inner-city children how to,

37:37.360 --> 37:39.420
you know, escape from the ghetto.

37:39.450 --> 37:40.360
You know, things like that.

37:40.390 --> 37:42.720
Because it's such a hell hole down there, you know.

37:42.750 --> 37:46.270
Yeah. You know, my firehouse is up in harlem, and we do...

37:46.300 --> 37:48.250
we fight a lot of fires up there, and it is.

37:48.280 --> 37:51.910
Once you get in some of those places and you see the way people live, it'S...

37:51.940 --> 37:53.900
you know, it's just tragic.

37:53.940 --> 37:55.410
Yeah.

37:55.440 --> 37:57.660
God, your hands are so long, your fingers.

37:57.690 --> 37:58.390
Yeah.

37:59.790 --> 38:00.920
That's my phone.
I'm sorry.

38:00.960 --> 38:01.900
I'm so sorry.
It's so rude.

38:01.930 --> 38:04.250
I don't normally travel with a phone but, um...

38:04.730 --> 38:06.250
Hello.

38:06.290 --> 38:08.100
Oh, it's my psychiatrist.
Just be a second.

38:08.130 --> 38:10.800
Hi.
No, I'm on a date.

38:10.820 --> 38:12.840
He's a firefighter.

38:13.220 --> 38:14.630
Are you on any medication?

38:14.650 --> 38:16.020
No?
Ok.

38:16.040 --> 38:18.310
No, I just- ok, but one quick question.

38:18.370 --> 38:20.690
So, what you gave me before, the inbuteral,

38:20.720 --> 38:23.420
that comes in a capsule form, and you gave me that guillotine for pills,

38:23.490 --> 38:25.150
and I'm just afraid that if I use it on the capsules,

38:25.190 --> 38:27.050
that those little beads will go everywhere, and you know,

38:27.080 --> 38:29.030
I'm really tight with money right now.

38:29.780 --> 38:31.490
Ok.
So maybe you could...

38:31.520 --> 38:33.690
ok.
You, too. All right. Bye-bye.

38:34.070 --> 38:35.890
He's such A...
you know, worrywart.

38:35.930 --> 38:37.660
- Yeah.
- Do you have any warts?

38:37.690 --> 38:39.260
You know, I'm gonna-

38:39.290 --> 38:41.210
What?You're gonna go tinkle?

38:41.240 --> 38:42.840
Yep.
I'll be right back.

38:42.870 --> 38:44.030
Ok. You'll be right back.

38:44.060 --> 38:45.500
Right.
You're coming back, though, right?

38:45.540 --> 38:46.440
You really are?

38:46.470 --> 38:48.960
Why don't you leave something here so I know you're coming back?

38:48.990 --> 38:51.350
Just anything.
Do you have anything you can leave?

38:51.380 --> 38:52.830
Johnny's out of jail.

38:52.860 --> 38:54.530
I made you look.

38:54.560 --> 38:56.260
Ok.
Hurry up.

39:12.420 --> 39:14.210
- Hello.
- Hey.

39:14.240 --> 39:15.550
Hey.
How's it going?

39:15.590 --> 39:17.220
She hasn't ordered any food, ok?

39:17.260 --> 39:18.480
Oh, that's perfect.

39:18.510 --> 39:20.430
She's a cheap date, cheaper than shari feldman.

39:20.450 --> 39:22.390
She's also a repeater.

39:22.420 --> 39:23.780
She farts a lot?

39:23.800 --> 39:26.590
I mean every time I say something, she repeats it back to me, ok?

39:26.620 --> 39:28.340
Tom, that's perfect.

39:28.410 --> 39:29.870
All you got to do is say,

39:29.900 --> 39:33.300
"I'd like to take you to my car and blow you,"

39:33.360 --> 39:36.350
and she repeats it back, and you say yes, bingo.

39:36.400 --> 39:37.570
Ok.
You know what?

39:37.600 --> 39:40.180
You need to call me back, and you need to make it like an emergency thing,

39:40.210 --> 39:42.330
like there's a fire or something, and it's a big fire,

39:42.360 --> 39:44.260
and I've got to come into work.

39:45.710 --> 39:48.160
Lou?
Shit!

39:58.740 --> 40:00.240
Hey.

40:04.390 --> 40:05.900
Oh.
You want some water?

40:05.930 --> 40:06.910
No.
I'm fine.

40:08.950 --> 40:10.100
I'm sorry.
I'm so rude.

40:10.130 --> 40:12.130
I'm so embarrassed.
Oh.

40:12.480 --> 40:14.220
- Everything go ok in the bathroom?
- Yeah.

40:14.280 --> 40:16.250
Your steak didn't come yet, but it will soon.

40:16.280 --> 40:17.930
You know, I was thinking about spiders-

40:17.960 --> 40:19.300
Sorry. Just excuse me 2 seconds.

40:19.330 --> 40:20.800
Sure. Ok.
I'll tell you when you get back.

40:20.840 --> 40:23.530
But it was going to be about rabbits and how some people consider it to be,

40:23.560 --> 40:24.510
like, in the rodent family-

40:24.570 --> 40:26.690
You know what?Call 911, will you?

41:04.710 --> 41:08.060
Help! Help me!

42:00.380 --> 42:03.150
I need a ladder on the second floor right now.

42:04.890 --> 42:07.190
Jesus, gavin.
Don't you ever take a day off?

42:07.220 --> 42:08.080
Nope.

42:08.100 --> 42:10.300
You got 2 more people up on the second floor, by the way.

42:10.360 --> 42:12.030
Yeah.
Whatever, asshole.

42:12.060 --> 42:13.610
Yeah, I'm the asshole.

42:13.950 --> 42:15.910
We got 2 guys up on 2.

42:15.940 --> 42:18.330
- Hey.
- Hey.

42:19.080 --> 42:20.330
Wow.

42:21.370 --> 42:23.320
You're...

42:23.350 --> 42:25.290
you're a little bit on fire.

42:37.080 --> 42:39.470
Well, that was rude.

42:39.490 --> 42:41.800
Look.
Your hand is bleeding.

42:45.390 --> 42:46.440
God.

42:46.470 --> 42:48.270
I'll go get some napkins.

42:49.305 --> 42:55.429
