WEBVTT

00:10.041 --> 00:12.750
<i>In our timeline
Flynne Fisher no longer exists.</i>

00:14.000 --> 00:16.500
<i>It's fairly
straightforward, gentlemen.</i>

00:16.625 --> 00:17.625
We advance from floor to floor,

00:17.625 --> 00:19.250
killing or disabling
everything we encounter.

00:21.250 --> 00:23.166
- What's your biggest fear?
- The past.

00:23.833 --> 00:27.083
If you try to double-cross me
again, I will carve you up.

00:27.083 --> 00:28.875
We got a situation on our hands.

00:30.333 --> 00:32.416
I need that old man alive.

00:33.791 --> 00:35.416
Technology that's been
stolen from you?

00:35.416 --> 00:37.291
<i>It can be a deadly weapon
in the wrong hands.</i>

00:51.625 --> 00:52.750
Hey.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.250
I-I-I've been thinking.

01:05.250 --> 01:06.750
Yeah?

01:06.875 --> 01:08.500
Lying here.

01:09.500 --> 01:11.208
About you and your sims.

01:12.250 --> 01:16.166
How you can go back, reboot.

01:17.916 --> 01:19.416
Wishing I could do it.

01:21.250 --> 01:25.000
Go back to that level
with the dog again.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.666
Shoot that bitch
this time.

01:28.833 --> 01:30.916
That's the thing about chess.

01:33.791 --> 01:38.041
Checkmate...
and you're fucking done.

01:41.333 --> 01:44.208
That's what makes life so hard.

01:44.208 --> 01:47.083
No rebooting.

04:15.708 --> 04:18.333
Unit 204,

04:18.333 --> 04:20.833
requesting immediate backup
to 27 Bateville Road.

04:20.833 --> 04:22.083
I got three parties down,

04:22.083 --> 04:24.291
suspect at large,
presumed armed.

04:24.291 --> 04:27.666
I repeat: suspect at large
and presumed armed.

04:27.666 --> 04:29.166
<i>Copy that, 204.</i>

04:29.166 --> 04:31.875
<i>10-52. Ambulance being
dispatched. Over.</i>

04:43.666 --> 04:45.458
I really wouldn't worry
about it at this point.

04:45.458 --> 04:48.500
Do the best you can, maybe get
back to it in the morning.

05:02.375 --> 05:03.916
Deputy?

05:03.916 --> 05:05.375
EMT's got a pulse.

05:05.375 --> 05:07.625
For who?

05:14.958 --> 05:18.666
<i>Dispatch, shots fired
at Clanton Urgent Med. 10-52...</i>

05:21.375 --> 05:23.583
<i>10-52. Requesting backup.</i>

05:26.291 --> 05:27.541
Mm-hmm.

05:30.125 --> 05:32.208
- What is it?
- Uh, shots fired.

05:32.208 --> 05:35.041
Clanton Urgent Med.
It's got to be our perp.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.541
Reece is dead.

06:06.541 --> 06:09.458
I heard, on the ride over.

06:09.458 --> 06:13.041
They said that man
killed the sheriff, too.

06:13.041 --> 06:15.000
And the Picketts.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.708
Corbell's still hanging on.

06:17.791 --> 06:19.541
But he killed Sheriff Jackman?

06:21.916 --> 06:23.666
Tommy?

06:23.666 --> 06:26.000
Yeah, he did.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.666
Shot him dead.

06:34.875 --> 06:36.166
<i>If Dr. Nuland has
her way,</i>

06:36.166 --> 06:37.541
<i>your friend won't be the last.</i>

06:37.541 --> 06:40.625
<i>I assume you'd like to stop her.</i>

06:40.625 --> 06:42.958
Yeah, of course.

06:42.958 --> 06:44.958
I'd like to propose an alliance.

06:46.083 --> 06:48.541
I have resources that
could prove quite empowering

06:48.541 --> 06:50.250
to you in your world.

06:50.250 --> 06:52.583
And it appears you have
the capacity to act in mine

06:52.583 --> 06:56.166
in ways that might be beyond me,

06:56.166 --> 06:58.291
considering the factors
at play here,

06:58.291 --> 07:00.375
which I've only
just become cognizant of.

07:00.375 --> 07:01.791
What do you mean?

07:01.791 --> 07:04.708
You have much more than
Cherise Nuland to deal with,

07:04.708 --> 07:07.416
as daunting as
the good doctor undoubtedly is.

07:08.791 --> 07:11.208
Your world is on a threshold
of its own Jackpot.

07:11.208 --> 07:14.000
I believe, in my own way,

07:14.000 --> 07:17.083
I can help you navigate
the coming storm.

07:21.416 --> 07:23.375
If we're coming
towards an agreement,

07:23.375 --> 07:26.291
now might be the ideal moment
for you to issue

07:26.291 --> 07:29.833
any ultimatums
or demands you might have.

07:31.916 --> 07:33.041
My mama.

07:34.083 --> 07:38.000
She's blind again and sick.

07:39.250 --> 07:41.666
I need you to heal her,

07:41.666 --> 07:44.583
like you promised you'd do at
the start of this whole thing.

07:49.458 --> 07:50.958
Ma'am?

07:50.958 --> 07:53.500
She's consulting the Aunties.

07:54.666 --> 07:56.458
I'm very sorry.

07:56.458 --> 07:58.583
It appears
Mr. Zubov's technicals have

07:58.583 --> 08:00.791
already attempted
everything possible.

08:08.125 --> 08:10.958
What, so you can't... help her?

08:12.583 --> 08:14.041
I'm afraid not.

08:15.500 --> 08:17.958
The Aunties' best estimate is,
your mother has

08:17.958 --> 08:21.958
another 554 hours to live.

08:21.958 --> 08:23.583
Approximately 23 days.

08:34.875 --> 08:36.291
I'll go talk to her.

08:37.750 --> 08:39.666
Please do.

08:50.833 --> 08:51.958
Flynne.

08:54.833 --> 08:57.333
They promised us, Burton.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.541
They promised us.

09:28.875 --> 09:31.708
<i>I know you're sad,
Flynne, but...</i>

09:34.333 --> 09:35.666
I had a strange feeling

09:35.666 --> 09:37.125
when I first found out
about the glioma,

09:37.125 --> 09:39.875
concerning you.

09:39.875 --> 09:41.541
I was lying there
in that exam room,

09:41.541 --> 09:43.958
just kind of
letting it wash over me.

09:45.583 --> 09:50.583
And I found myself thinking,
"Well, maybe it's not all bad.

09:50.583 --> 09:54.583
Maybe Flynne will really get
to live her life now."

09:58.333 --> 10:01.333
I've been living my life exactly
as I want to, Mama, okay?

10:03.166 --> 10:05.250
I wouldn't have chosen
any otherwise.

10:05.250 --> 10:09.083
I know, and don't think
I don't love you for it.

10:09.083 --> 10:13.500
You've been keeping us
all afloat for a long time now,

10:13.500 --> 10:16.791
but you deserve more.

10:16.791 --> 10:19.250
I thought...

10:19.250 --> 10:21.166
"Maybe they can sell the house,
if they want.

10:21.166 --> 10:22.666
There'll be some money there."

10:23.708 --> 10:27.375
"Burton will go on being Burton,
for better for worse, but..."

10:29.125 --> 10:31.916
"...who knows
what Flynne might get up to?"

10:33.250 --> 10:36.041
And it made me sort of excited
to think on it.

10:37.291 --> 10:42.458
You having the chance
to become whatever you want.

10:56.916 --> 10:59.250
Where are you off to?

11:00.750 --> 11:03.166
I think
your pills are kicking in, Mama.

11:03.166 --> 11:05.791
I was just gonna let you rest.

11:10.333 --> 11:12.375
Your father used to call you
our little acorn

11:12.375 --> 11:13.708
when you were a baby.

11:13.708 --> 11:17.208
Why?

11:17.208 --> 11:19.458
Because even though
you were just a tiny thing,

11:19.458 --> 11:22.916
he could sense the power
and strength inside you,

11:22.916 --> 11:26.125
waiting for its chance to grow.

11:27.125 --> 11:30.333
Just like a big old oak tree.

11:31.333 --> 11:33.666
I miss him, Mama.

11:35.375 --> 11:37.250
Me, too.

11:37.250 --> 11:39.666
Promise me, Flynne.

11:39.666 --> 11:42.750
You'll let that power grow.

12:06.666 --> 12:09.250
Maria Anathema Ash.

12:10.625 --> 12:13.166
Intriguing résumé.

12:13.166 --> 12:16.458
How on earth did you end up
in Lev Zubov's employ?

12:16.458 --> 12:18.250
It's a complicated story,

12:18.250 --> 12:20.000
and not particularly relevant

12:20.000 --> 12:22.541
- to what's prompted me
to reach out to you.
- Which is?

12:24.416 --> 12:26.791
The data Aelita West stole,

12:26.791 --> 12:29.083
I know where it is
and how to get it.

12:29.083 --> 12:32.375
It's in Flynne Fisher's brain.

12:33.375 --> 12:36.375
Lev Zubov knows this,

12:36.375 --> 12:39.250
so the Klept will soon have
everything Aelita stole.

12:39.250 --> 12:41.166
I don't want to live
in that world, Doctor.

12:41.166 --> 12:42.583
Okay, well, Inspector Lowbeer...

12:42.583 --> 12:44.875
Clearly has her own agenda.

12:44.875 --> 12:46.166
I don't know what it is,

12:46.166 --> 12:48.791
but you can't depend on her
to fix it.

12:48.791 --> 12:51.750
You have to stop him.

12:51.750 --> 12:54.041
Can you?

12:57.083 --> 12:59.666
I can.

13:00.958 --> 13:03.583
But it will require
a drastic step.

13:03.583 --> 13:08.125
More drastic than
I had hoped would be necessary

13:08.125 --> 13:11.083
and come at an unspeakable cost.

13:12.750 --> 13:15.125
How much time do I have?

13:15.125 --> 13:16.791
Very little.

13:16.791 --> 13:18.541
I suppose
you'll be expecting a reward

13:18.541 --> 13:21.791
for bearing me
these ill tidings?

13:22.875 --> 13:24.083
I want you to kill him.

13:24.083 --> 13:25.958
Who?

13:25.958 --> 13:27.250
Zubov.

13:31.208 --> 13:32.791
May I ask why?

13:35.791 --> 13:37.708
A breach of etiquette.

13:41.416 --> 13:43.916
Well, it's not so easy,
what you ask,

13:43.916 --> 13:46.208
given his Klept status.

13:47.916 --> 13:49.166
Unless...

13:50.875 --> 13:52.791
...you'd be willing
to use your presence

13:52.791 --> 13:56.666
in Mr. Zubov's household
to assist in the endeavor?

13:59.291 --> 14:01.916
I would, with pleasure.

14:03.583 --> 14:05.916
Excellent.
I'll be in touch.

14:05.916 --> 14:07.125
Your drastic step...

14:08.500 --> 14:09.583
What is it?

14:12.375 --> 14:15.916
I'm afraid I will be forced
to alter conditions

14:15.916 --> 14:18.791
in the stub
in a manner that will destroy

14:18.791 --> 14:22.416
or invalidate
decades' worth of studies,

14:22.416 --> 14:24.708
vitally important research.

14:24.708 --> 14:29.708
But I will cut off a limb
to save the whole body.

14:29.708 --> 14:30.833
I don't understand.

14:32.208 --> 14:34.125
The Jackpot.

14:34.125 --> 14:35.583
I'll push it
to the next level,

14:35.583 --> 14:39.000
thus removing the girl
from the equation altogether.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.791
Along with her home,
town, family,

14:41.791 --> 14:43.125
the whole benighted region.

15:16.708 --> 15:18.791
Welcome back.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.125
How's your mother?

15:24.125 --> 15:26.291
Dying.

15:27.458 --> 15:29.625
Which I guess you suspected
all along, huh?

15:30.708 --> 15:31.708
I'm sorry, Flynne.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.625
I presented a possibility
as a certainty

15:36.625 --> 15:38.416
to get you to do our bidding.

15:39.458 --> 15:40.750
It was wrong.

15:48.041 --> 15:50.166
You think
we can still find your sister?

15:57.083 --> 15:58.958
She's dead.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.458
I can't see any way around it.

16:00.458 --> 16:02.208
Wilf.

16:05.875 --> 16:08.750
I'm sorry, Wilf.

16:18.416 --> 16:20.333
I keep feeling like
I'm missing something obvious,

16:20.333 --> 16:23.708
that I'm just
too close to see it.

16:25.750 --> 16:27.625
Aelita told me I had a home
when I was young.

16:27.625 --> 16:29.541
<i>She said
I used to talk about it.</i>

16:31.125 --> 16:34.250
<i>A lawn sloping down to a pond.</i>

16:38.583 --> 16:39.916
But my first memories are
of the transit camp.

16:39.916 --> 16:42.125
<i>The food queues.</i>

16:42.125 --> 16:45.000
<i>Rain falling on the blue tarp.</i>

16:45.000 --> 16:46.416
A woman's face...

16:47.458 --> 16:48.875
<i>...who I've always chosen
to believe was my mother.</i>

16:50.916 --> 16:52.458
Though it's likely
that's just fantasy.

16:52.458 --> 16:54.291
What about your father?

16:55.875 --> 16:57.333
<i>They took
all the men early on.</i>

16:59.250 --> 17:01.541
<i>I have no memories
of the raids on the camps,</i>

17:01.541 --> 17:04.375
<i>but Aelita told me
how they burned us out.</i>

17:07.500 --> 17:09.750
<i>She took charge of me.</i>

17:09.750 --> 17:11.250
I would have died without her.

17:11.250 --> 17:13.166
Where'd you go after that?

17:13.166 --> 17:16.041
The streets, the ruins.

17:17.833 --> 17:19.250
For almost three years.

17:20.375 --> 17:22.083
And then?

17:23.208 --> 17:24.375
I did something stupid.

17:24.375 --> 17:26.291
Wolf! Wolf!

17:26.291 --> 17:28.125
<i>We were captured.</i>

17:28.125 --> 17:29.333
<i>Cleaned up.</i>

17:29.333 --> 17:32.000
<i>Aelita fought
to keep us together.</i>

17:32.000 --> 17:33.708
<i>She always pined
for that life, though.</i>

17:33.708 --> 17:35.333
<i>"When we were free,"
she would say.</i>

17:35.333 --> 17:38.458
<i>So we ran off a few years
after we were adopted.</i>

17:38.458 --> 17:40.416
Aelita planned it.

17:40.416 --> 17:42.875
Squirreled away supplies,
mapped our route back.

17:44.333 --> 17:46.958
We lasted for eight months or so
in our own little kingdom.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.416
We even made a flag for it.

17:50.416 --> 17:51.833
The hand missing a thumb.

17:51.833 --> 17:53.375
Why?

17:55.000 --> 17:57.958
Aelita used to say we'd
all lived in a paradise once.

17:59.208 --> 18:01.041
Before we evolved
into what we are.

18:01.041 --> 18:02.791
- Hmm.
- She claimed

18:02.791 --> 18:06.166
every sin of ours originated
with the opposable thumb.

18:06.166 --> 18:07.750
The ability to grip...

18:09.208 --> 18:14.416
...tools, weapons, throats.

18:17.208 --> 18:19.208
What happened
after the eight months?

18:20.958 --> 18:23.000
I fell sick.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.166
I would have died.

18:24.166 --> 18:27.333
Aelita brought me back in.

18:27.333 --> 18:30.458
She gave up everything,
once again, to save me.

18:32.250 --> 18:33.541
She really loved you, Wilf.

18:38.458 --> 18:40.083
Inspector Lowbeer's asked me
to have a word...

18:41.500 --> 18:43.166
...about her proposal.

18:44.791 --> 18:47.041
But I'm afraid I'm not
quite certain what to say,

18:47.041 --> 18:49.041
because one must always assume
she can hear us,

18:49.041 --> 18:50.208
should she choose.

18:52.500 --> 18:54.833
Is there something
you want to tell me?

18:56.083 --> 18:57.333
You feel like you can't?

18:57.333 --> 18:59.875
I wouldn't put it
quite that pointedly.

18:59.875 --> 19:02.416
It's more of a shading
than a specific thing.

19:03.708 --> 19:05.250
Well,
why don't we link up again?

19:06.291 --> 19:07.250
Why?

19:07.250 --> 19:09.125
I can ask you questions.

19:09.125 --> 19:10.958
You don't have to say anything.

19:10.958 --> 19:13.250
I can just, I don't know,

19:13.250 --> 19:16.541
draw my own conclusions
by the way that you feel.

19:29.291 --> 19:31.500
How do you feel about Lowbeer?

19:33.583 --> 19:35.333
<i>I'd like to propose
an alliance.</i>

19:38.416 --> 19:39.583
Lev?

19:41.250 --> 19:43.916
<i>You will never be
fully yourself</i>

19:43.916 --> 19:46.541
<i>until you embrace
that part of your soul.</i>

19:47.583 --> 19:48.583
Aelita?

19:50.708 --> 19:52.083
<i>The individual
you know, his overture--</i>

19:52.083 --> 19:53.333
<i>or whatever you want
to call it--</i>

19:53.333 --> 19:56.458
<i>it's gonna make me happy,
is it?</i>

19:59.250 --> 20:00.541
Flynne Fisher?

20:14.375 --> 20:15.666
Wilf Netherton?

20:18.375 --> 20:19.916
You're all rainbows
and unicorns, Ms. Fisher.

20:41.333 --> 20:43.375
Wait.

20:43.375 --> 20:44.708
Where was it?

20:45.750 --> 20:46.916
What?

20:46.916 --> 20:49.750
The hand with no thumb,
your secret place.

20:51.416 --> 20:52.500
Christ.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.625
I'm such a fool.

21:05.166 --> 21:07.083
Should we call Zubov?

21:13.250 --> 21:14.208
No.

21:15.708 --> 21:18.708
We serve a new master now.

21:24.666 --> 21:27.000
- You sure this is where it is?
- But it wasn't like this.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.416
It was forest,
trees as far as you can see.

21:41.458 --> 21:43.083
Wilf.

21:49.833 --> 21:52.166
What took you so long, Wolf?

21:52.166 --> 21:54.291
No more games, Aelita.
Where are you?

21:54.291 --> 21:56.500
Follow me.
But not her.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.041
No, she's the heart of this.
She's coming.

21:59.041 --> 22:00.750
Eyes and ears, Wolf.

22:00.750 --> 22:03.250
She shares hers with others.

22:03.250 --> 22:04.750
<i>Isn't that right, Ash?</i>

22:04.750 --> 22:08.458
<i>She can leave of her own accord,
or I can send her myself.</i>

22:11.166 --> 22:12.291
Your choice.

22:13.875 --> 22:16.083
- But...
- Go home.

22:17.625 --> 22:19.708
I'll tell you everything.
I give you my word.

22:48.041 --> 22:49.250
Look familiar?

22:50.666 --> 22:52.416
This is where the camp was,

22:52.416 --> 22:54.666
where we first met.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.208
You don't remember, do you?

22:58.208 --> 22:59.333
I was too young.

22:59.333 --> 23:01.625
You were seven, Wolf.

23:01.625 --> 23:03.083
It was too young
for many things,

23:03.083 --> 23:06.333
but remembering isn't
one of them.

23:19.416 --> 23:23.000
The reason you don't remember is
'cause you're not supposed to.

23:25.500 --> 23:26.750
Aelita.

23:28.083 --> 23:31.208
Our implants, turns out
they're rather complex devices.

23:31.208 --> 23:34.750
And one thing that they do
do best is suppress memory.

23:34.750 --> 23:38.083
Everyone knows that.
They blunt trauma.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.250
Well, do you want to know what
happened when I ripped out mine?

23:40.250 --> 23:43.708
You lost your immunity boost,
among other things,

23:43.708 --> 23:45.458
which I suspect
you'll soon come to regret.

23:46.541 --> 23:49.166
No, I started
to remember things.

23:49.166 --> 23:51.000
Everything.

23:52.791 --> 23:53.958
There's bodies here,

23:53.958 --> 23:56.875
under this beautiful green turf,

23:56.875 --> 23:59.958
thousands and thousands
of bodies.

23:59.958 --> 24:01.291
Dig a hole, love.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.208
Your mother's here,

24:07.208 --> 24:10.625
and your sisters
and your little brother.

24:10.625 --> 24:14.166
And you'd remember them
if you'd just cut yourself free.

24:15.708 --> 24:17.041
My family, too.

24:17.041 --> 24:19.166
All slaughtered.

24:22.125 --> 24:24.416
Give it to him.

24:31.041 --> 24:33.166
Are you just gonna stand there
with your hands in your pockets?

24:33.166 --> 24:35.708
Fucking pick it up.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.208
Do you want to know
who killed our families, Wolf?

24:40.208 --> 24:42.708
The Klept.

24:42.708 --> 24:46.541
Your mate Lev's father
and his sort,

24:46.541 --> 24:48.416
'cause they were
running things by then.

24:48.416 --> 24:50.708
There was contagion
in the camps,

24:50.708 --> 24:53.000
and they wiped us all out
for fear of it.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.541
And not just here,
all over England.

24:55.541 --> 24:57.083
It was
a little coordinated effort.

24:57.083 --> 24:59.500
Five million people
in under a fortnight.

24:59.500 --> 25:01.208
Now, that's quite
an achievement, isn't it?

25:01.208 --> 25:02.625
Don't you think?

25:04.083 --> 25:06.083
So, yeah,
they suppress our memories

25:06.083 --> 25:07.750
because they still fear us.

25:07.750 --> 25:09.375
Us?

25:18.708 --> 25:20.416
I'm gathering them.

25:20.416 --> 25:22.291
A little army
of the dispossessed.

25:22.291 --> 25:24.291
You know, render justice.

25:24.291 --> 25:25.791
What could you possibly plan
to accomplish with this rabble?

25:25.791 --> 25:27.708
Shatter a few windows?

25:27.708 --> 25:29.916
I'm sure the Klept
and the R.I. will be terrified.

25:29.916 --> 25:32.583
- All we need are
the proper tools.
- Which are?

25:32.583 --> 25:35.750
The secrets to every wonder
that the R.I. have ever built.

25:35.750 --> 25:38.333
Infinity
in the palm of your hand.

25:39.333 --> 25:42.458
And where would you possibly
get that?

25:42.458 --> 25:44.916
Inside the girl's head.

25:53.416 --> 25:55.083
<i>That doctor give you</i>

25:55.083 --> 25:58.375
<i>a probability or anything,
Jasper? You know, like,</i>

25:58.375 --> 26:00.791
ten percent chance of survival,
something like that?

26:00.791 --> 26:02.833
He just said I should
prepare for the worst.

26:02.833 --> 26:05.083
Well, I'm real sorry
for your loss.

26:05.083 --> 26:07.375
You know, we all are.

26:07.375 --> 26:11.625
But, uh, he died
like a warrior king, didn't he?

26:11.625 --> 26:14.041
- He's not dead yet.
- You know what I mean.

26:14.041 --> 26:16.708
He went out fighting.

26:17.833 --> 26:21.416
And we owe it to him
to carry on his legacy.

26:21.416 --> 26:25.500
So, uh, guess
I'm next in charge, right?

26:25.500 --> 26:27.541
How you figure?

26:28.625 --> 26:29.833
Well, I was always
his number two.

26:29.833 --> 26:34.041
- The fuck you were.
- All right, all right.

26:34.041 --> 26:36.916
Let's say
we approach this thing like a...

26:36.916 --> 26:38.250
uh, what do you call it?

26:38.250 --> 26:40.708
That thing that the Romans did

26:40.708 --> 26:42.875
when, uh,
there were three emperors?

26:42.875 --> 26:44.375
Fuck, what was it?

26:44.375 --> 26:46.958
Uh, a, uh...

26:46.958 --> 26:49.500
A triumvirate.

26:49.500 --> 26:51.583
Yeah, that's it.

26:52.750 --> 26:53.958
Yeah, but there's four of us.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.750
Aw.

27:00.750 --> 27:02.375
You can still drive for us, Jasper.

27:02.375 --> 27:04.208
Wash our cars and shit.

27:04.208 --> 27:07.666
Oh, absolutely, you-you do
a great job with them cars.

27:07.666 --> 27:10.583
Now...

27:13.250 --> 27:15.041
Let's get a fresh one of these.

27:18.500 --> 27:19.750
Go on.

27:24.250 --> 27:26.041
<i>♪ I need your help...</i>

27:34.041 --> 27:37.916
Oh, and, um...
put it on your uncle's tab,

27:37.916 --> 27:40.458
if they're still honoring it.

27:40.458 --> 27:43.583
<i>♪ You're the only one
who can save my soul ♪</i>

27:47.541 --> 27:50.291
<i>Save my soul ♪</i>

28:05.958 --> 28:08.583
Open
the fucking window.

28:08.583 --> 28:09.875
What?

28:09.875 --> 28:12.541
Open the fuck...

28:19.291 --> 28:22.541
You're gonna have to
clean that up now, Jasper.

28:41.250 --> 28:43.708
Who should I drop off first?

30:18.208 --> 30:19.291
Jasper?

30:21.750 --> 30:24.625
You remember that fight
we had about Monopoly?

30:24.625 --> 30:26.875
<i>What time is it?</i>

30:26.875 --> 30:28.250
It's a little after 2:00.

30:28.250 --> 30:32.416
We were playing Flynne and
Burton and Ella on Thanksgiving.

30:32.416 --> 30:36.666
And, uh, I was way ahead,

30:36.666 --> 30:39.708
and I was sort of
feeling bad about it,

30:39.708 --> 30:42.000
so I kept letting people
borrow money

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
when it seemed like
they were about to go bust.

30:45.625 --> 30:47.583
<i>And then,</i>

30:47.583 --> 30:50.333
<i>in the end, Burton came back
from nothing to win.</i>

30:50.333 --> 30:53.208
Hon, are you drunk?

30:55.000 --> 30:56.791
<i>You got mad at me after.</i>

30:56.791 --> 30:58.291
<i>You said...</i>

30:59.333 --> 31:00.625
I'd never amount to anything

31:00.625 --> 31:03.416
if I didn't stop mistaking
weakness for kindness.

31:04.750 --> 31:07.875
Oh, Jasper.
I-I didn't mean that.

31:07.875 --> 31:09.125
Yes, you did.

31:09.125 --> 31:11.666
<i>No. No. I really didn't.</i>

31:11.666 --> 31:16.708
The whole reason I married you
is 'cause of how kind you are.

31:20.291 --> 31:22.708
Why'd you say that, then?

31:22.708 --> 31:25.500
<i>I guess I just wanted
you to win for once.</i>

31:25.500 --> 31:28.166
<i>I felt like you deserved it.</i>

31:32.875 --> 31:35.666
<i>Why are we having
this conversation?</i>

31:43.041 --> 31:45.416
I was about to make
a huge fucking mistake.

31:45.416 --> 31:48.916
<i>How do you mean?</i>

31:52.541 --> 31:54.583
Nothing. I love you.
I'll be home soon.

31:59.541 --> 32:02.458
Atticus!

32:05.500 --> 32:07.416
Fuck! Atticus!

32:10.416 --> 32:12.791
Atticus, wake up, man!
Atticus!

32:12.791 --> 32:14.458
Fucking wake the fuck up.

32:14.458 --> 32:16.583
Atticus! Atticus!

32:16.583 --> 32:21.000
Cash, Cash, Cash, Cash!

32:27.041 --> 32:28.958
Atticus!

32:28.958 --> 32:30.916
Hey.

32:35.041 --> 32:37.458
Atticus! Atticus!

32:37.458 --> 32:39.583
Atticus, wake up!

32:39.583 --> 32:42.541
Wake the fuck up.
Atticus!

32:47.500 --> 32:49.083
What the fuck?

32:54.416 --> 32:55.666
Oh, fuck.

33:45.833 --> 33:47.500
I heard about
that train crash, Tommy.

33:47.500 --> 33:49.541
That's not why I'm here.

33:52.208 --> 33:54.125
Look, I know you've been
keeping secrets,

33:54.125 --> 33:55.625
- Flynne.
- Tommy.

33:55.625 --> 33:57.458
Ain't no need to give me a line.

33:57.458 --> 33:59.375
I get it.

34:00.500 --> 34:04.041
I got a, uh, phone call
from Homeland Security.

34:04.041 --> 34:06.666
Right-wing militia chatter.

34:06.666 --> 34:09.041
Serious enough for Homes
to sound the alarm.

34:09.041 --> 34:10.541
Given all the weird things

34:10.541 --> 34:13.666
that've been swirling around
you and Burton,

34:13.791 --> 34:16.166
I need to know
if you know anything about it.

34:16.166 --> 34:17.666
What is it?

34:17.666 --> 34:20.250
They say they're planning
to blow up a missile silo.

34:21.291 --> 34:23.333
And, you know, there's
that new, uh, Air Force silo

34:23.333 --> 34:26.833
down towards Spring Creek,
the big one.

34:29.250 --> 34:32.666
Flynne, if you know
anything about this...

34:32.666 --> 34:34.166
I don't.

34:35.541 --> 34:37.458
I got to go, Tommy.

34:51.416 --> 34:55.750
Macon...
get the headset ready.

34:55.750 --> 34:57.541
I got to go back.

35:06.750 --> 35:09.375
Ash, Ash.

35:09.375 --> 35:10.708
Where's Wilf?

35:12.375 --> 35:13.666
Why are you back?

35:15.166 --> 35:17.041
That silo explosion,

35:17.041 --> 35:18.416
the one we saw
in the Jackpot museum.

35:18.416 --> 35:20.416
Cherise is trying to
make it happen in my timeline.

35:20.416 --> 35:22.833
I'm sure of it.

35:26.875 --> 35:28.125
You already knew?

35:35.125 --> 35:37.500
What the fuck
have you done, Ash?

35:39.750 --> 35:43.083
The data you and Aelita
stole from the R.I.,

35:43.083 --> 35:44.875
it's stored in DNA.

35:46.375 --> 35:48.000
It's the shit in my head,
isn't it?

35:49.875 --> 35:51.958
The reason I've been having
these fucking seizures.

35:53.125 --> 35:54.541
What is it?

35:54.541 --> 35:58.208
The entire library, I suspect.

35:58.208 --> 36:00.791
Enough to wreak havoc
in your world and mine.

36:02.541 --> 36:04.208
And now Lev knows about it.

36:06.166 --> 36:07.375
You have to understand,

36:07.375 --> 36:09.500
if the Klept got hold of it...

36:12.291 --> 36:13.833
I told Cherise Nuland.

36:13.833 --> 36:16.458
I had to.

36:16.458 --> 36:19.333
And now she's gonna vaporize
my entire fucking state

36:19.333 --> 36:20.916
just to make sure
that Lev doesn't

36:20.916 --> 36:22.541
get his hands on the data.

36:23.583 --> 36:26.375
My life, my family.

36:26.375 --> 36:28.666
Everyone that I love.

36:30.416 --> 36:32.500
It's just a fucking game to you,
isn't it?

36:33.791 --> 36:36.208
Winner takes all.

36:42.333 --> 36:44.000
Where are you going?

36:44.000 --> 36:45.125
I'm gonna win.

37:08.625 --> 37:11.041
 This is
the real London.

37:11.041 --> 37:13.791
At least the part
they haven't rebuilt yet.

37:13.791 --> 37:16.500
They got their work
cut out for 'em, don't they?

37:17.500 --> 37:19.875
Why are we here?

37:19.875 --> 37:23.291
So we can talk
without being overheard.

37:26.291 --> 37:28.875
Cherise Nuland,

37:28.875 --> 37:32.458
she's planning on blowing up
that silo over in Spring Creek.

37:32.458 --> 37:36.583
Wiping all of us out,
just to make sure that I'm dead.

37:36.583 --> 37:41.291
So I came up with an idea
to open up a new stub.

37:41.291 --> 37:43.625
You saying what I think you are?

37:45.250 --> 37:47.458
You want to reboot?

37:47.458 --> 37:48.875
Like in a sim?

37:48.875 --> 37:50.916
It could save us, Conner.

37:51.958 --> 37:56.041
But I'm gonna need your help
and Lowbeer's, too.

37:58.083 --> 37:59.833
<i>It's a black hole.</i>

37:59.833 --> 38:01.541
In a sim,
you can get to a level

38:01.541 --> 38:03.416
where no matter what you do
you end up dying,

38:03.416 --> 38:05.541
over and over,
'cause you made some mistake

38:05.541 --> 38:08.416
earlier in the game
without even realizing it.

38:08.416 --> 38:10.125
You're trapped.

38:10.125 --> 38:12.041
I'm sorry, my dear.

38:12.041 --> 38:14.375
I wish it hadn't come to this.

38:14.375 --> 38:15.958
When we first met, I asked you
if you had the power

38:15.958 --> 38:18.833
to sever the connection
to my stub.

38:18.833 --> 38:20.375
Do you?

38:20.375 --> 38:22.291
No.

38:22.291 --> 38:24.333
What about opening a new one?

38:25.541 --> 38:28.666
I'm afraid the delicate balance
of power that governs this world

38:28.666 --> 38:30.125
would make
such a step on my part

38:30.125 --> 38:31.583
an outright declaration of war.

38:33.250 --> 38:37.958
But I am aware of
how one might do it.

38:39.083 --> 38:40.791
I need you to open a new stub.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.458
If I understand this correctly,

38:44.458 --> 38:48.791
you're proposing
a rather radical plan.

38:48.791 --> 38:52.958
Cherise will think she won
and that you helped her do it.

38:52.958 --> 38:56.125
We'd have access to
all the data that Aelita stole,

38:56.125 --> 38:59.083
which would save my world
from the Jackpot.

38:59.083 --> 39:01.083
You do realize
how daunting the odds are?

39:01.083 --> 39:03.708
Perhaps an ally
might benefit you.

39:03.708 --> 39:05.416
Your brother, for instance.

39:05.416 --> 39:07.458
Burton can't know.

39:07.458 --> 39:08.750
If he finds out,

39:08.750 --> 39:10.083
he's never gonna let me
go through with it, okay?

39:10.083 --> 39:13.041
Conner said that he'd help.

39:16.541 --> 39:18.125
Are you absolutely certain?

39:19.541 --> 39:20.791
Yeah.

39:23.250 --> 39:27.833
The R.I. has several ancillary
sites at undisclosed locations.

39:27.833 --> 39:29.583
Stub portals, they're called.

39:29.583 --> 39:32.041
Even the guards don't know
where they are.

39:32.041 --> 39:34.541
They're Peripherals,
piloted remotely.

39:34.541 --> 39:37.000
The Peripherals guarding
the facility will be

39:37.000 --> 39:38.208
just as strong as you are.

39:39.791 --> 39:41.875
Send me to one.

39:54.916 --> 39:57.000
I've arrived.

40:07.166 --> 40:09.083
May I be of assistance?

40:11.583 --> 40:12.666
Maybe.

40:12.666 --> 40:15.208
Can I ask you a question?

40:15.208 --> 40:18.208
Is it still queasy
when you get back?

40:18.208 --> 40:19.833
Or did they fix that?

40:19.833 --> 40:22.833
When you wake up
in your real body,

40:22.833 --> 40:25.125
after your shift
in this Peripheral's done?

41:10.250 --> 41:11.833
Damn it.

42:24.791 --> 42:27.958
You really think
you could escape me so easily?

42:27.958 --> 42:29.208
You have a bad habit

42:29.208 --> 42:31.458
of taking control
of dying things, Cherise.

42:31.458 --> 42:34.166
You have no idea
all you're putting into peril.

42:35.208 --> 42:37.291
They're all here,
aren't they?

42:37.291 --> 42:39.500
All these other lives?

42:39.500 --> 42:42.166
And all I got to do is
choose where I want to begin.

42:42.166 --> 42:43.833
Wait.

42:43.833 --> 42:45.750
I will find you.

42:45.750 --> 42:47.416
I give you my word.

42:47.416 --> 42:49.833
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure, Cherise.

42:53.166 --> 42:57.125
I think I want to be
the hunter now.

42:57.125 --> 42:59.916
You see,
I know exactly where you are.

42:59.916 --> 43:03.208
<i>And you have no idea
where I'm gonna be.</i>

43:03.750 --> 43:06.166
Not without the coordinates.

43:12.833 --> 43:14.833
No, no, no.

43:38.041 --> 43:40.166
<i>You saying
what I think you are?</i>

43:41.875 --> 43:44.208
<i>You want to reboot.</i>

43:44.208 --> 43:45.500
<i>Like in a sim?</i>

43:45.500 --> 43:47.541
It could save us, Conner.

43:48.583 --> 43:52.708
But I'm gonna need your help
and Lowbeer's, too.

43:53.708 --> 43:54.875
If I can pull it off,

43:54.875 --> 43:56.208
there'll be
whole new versions of us there.

43:56.208 --> 43:59.291
Ones that Cherise
will have nothing to do with.

44:00.333 --> 44:01.916
We'd be safe there.

44:01.916 --> 44:04.875
But dead in our own world.

44:09.083 --> 44:10.458
Unless I'm already gone.

44:11.500 --> 44:13.875
Then she'd have no reason
to blow up that silo.

44:21.375 --> 44:23.208
Fuck.

44:25.916 --> 44:28.250
Burton said in Texas
you once shot somebody

44:28.250 --> 44:31.166
two kilometers out.

44:31.166 --> 44:33.250
Burton's full of shit.

44:33.250 --> 44:35.541
It was at least three klicks.

44:37.708 --> 44:39.958
This thing
that I'm talking about...

44:42.125 --> 44:44.458
...it'd have to look
like Lowbeer sent somebody

44:44.458 --> 44:48.166
as a favor to Cherise,
solving her problem for her.

44:50.458 --> 44:53.083
You understand
what I'm asking you, Conner?

44:54.750 --> 44:57.166
Yeah.

44:57.166 --> 44:59.333
I get it.

45:03.375 --> 45:05.625
What about this world?

45:05.625 --> 45:07.041
We done with it?

45:07.041 --> 45:09.291
No, we'll be back.

45:10.583 --> 45:11.583
Why?

45:13.333 --> 45:15.041
'Cause I'm gonna
kill that bitch.

45:18.166 --> 45:19.541
Yeah?

45:22.833 --> 45:24.625
Yeah.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.833
I know it's a lot, Conner.

45:29.916 --> 45:32.875
But if it helps any,
I've made peace with it.

45:35.625 --> 45:37.833
I'll just take a walk

45:37.833 --> 45:41.250
out past Hawthorne Creek.

45:41.250 --> 45:45.333
And I'll count back
from ten in my head.

47:04.458 --> 47:05.791
<i>Ten.</i>

47:07.125 --> 47:08.625
<i>Nine.</i>

47:08.625 --> 47:10.666
<i>Eight.</i>

47:14.833 --> 47:16.958
<i>Seven.</i>

47:16.958 --> 47:19.458
<i>Six.</i>

47:24.833 --> 47:26.666
<i>Five.</i>

47:27.833 --> 47:29.166
<i>Four.</i>

47:31.083 --> 47:32.666
<i>Three.</i>

47:37.000 --> 47:38.000
<i>Two.</i>

48:19.416 --> 48:21.625
So...

48:21.625 --> 48:23.875
shall we get to work?

51:04.083 --> 51:06.041
Yeah,
you promise every time,

51:06.041 --> 51:07.333
but you end up
spending the whole meal

51:07.333 --> 51:08.750
talking with your father,

51:08.750 --> 51:10.375
while I'm trapped
with your mother.

51:10.375 --> 51:11.916
My mother enjoys
your company, Dominika.

51:11.916 --> 51:15.875
Which is lovely and
extremely flattering, I'm sure.

51:15.875 --> 51:17.333
But as you're well aware,

51:17.333 --> 51:19.958
the sentiment
isn't entirely reciprocated.

51:21.000 --> 51:24.291
So if you could just
spare me a moment of your...

51:27.291 --> 51:30.958
Oh, Lev. What have you done?

51:32.416 --> 51:35.041
Nothing. I swear.

51:37.541 --> 51:39.541
I love you.

52:00.916 --> 52:03.750
I'm sorry, gentlemen,
there seems to be some...

52:05.708 --> 52:06.833
Have a seat.

52:06.833 --> 52:08.041
I was supposed to meet
my father...

52:08.041 --> 52:10.083
Your father sends his regrets.

52:10.083 --> 52:11.208
Wasn't feeling well.

52:11.208 --> 52:13.708
Not in the best of health.

52:13.708 --> 52:15.166
You understand.

52:15.166 --> 52:17.375
As such,
he asked us to speak with you.

52:27.291 --> 52:28.375
About what?

52:28.375 --> 52:31.125
Accepted practices
here in London

52:31.125 --> 52:32.625
since the Putin diaspora.

52:32.625 --> 52:35.166
Mm, how we get along, survive.

52:36.375 --> 52:37.583
Did I do something wrong?

52:37.583 --> 52:40.916
The Research Institute,
placing us at risk.

52:40.916 --> 52:43.750
It's unacceptable. Absolutely.

52:43.750 --> 52:45.291
There's a price, son.

52:47.333 --> 52:48.958
Listen, gentlemen.

52:48.958 --> 52:50.583
My recruitment of an asset

52:50.583 --> 52:53.041
inside the Research Institute
was nothing outside of the norm.

52:53.041 --> 52:55.875
I was trying to exploit
an opportunity.

52:55.875 --> 52:58.291
But I deeply regret
if I did anything

52:58.291 --> 53:02.208
that you feel could
jeopardize our standing.

53:02.208 --> 53:07.291
I assure you
that was never my intent.

53:07.291 --> 53:10.791
I, uh, sincerely apologize

53:10.791 --> 53:15.208
and can only hope
that you forgive me.

53:25.166 --> 53:28.291
Should see your fucking face!

53:35.541 --> 53:37.416
We get it.

53:37.416 --> 53:40.541
It is always in our interest
to keep tabs on the R.I.

53:40.541 --> 53:42.500
Not only for
moneymaking opportunities

53:42.500 --> 53:44.708
but to protect
our own interests.

53:44.708 --> 53:46.791
Business, otherwise.

53:46.791 --> 53:50.125
None of that matters now.
Time to cut bait.

53:50.125 --> 53:51.958
Do whatever you have to do.

53:51.958 --> 53:54.208
Just cauterize
the wound.

53:54.208 --> 53:56.916
Your asset, any affiliates
come back to you,

53:56.916 --> 53:58.166
they need to vanish.

53:59.875 --> 54:00.875
All of them?

54:00.875 --> 54:02.875
When there's a blight
on the branch

54:02.875 --> 54:04.416
and it threatens
the other trees,

54:04.416 --> 54:06.041
what does the orchard keeper do?

54:06.041 --> 54:09.041
Chops the fucker down.
Burns it.

54:09.041 --> 54:11.125
Not just the branch either.

54:11.125 --> 54:13.041
The whole fucking tree.

54:15.458 --> 54:17.541
Your wife looked lovely, Lev.

54:19.000 --> 54:20.333
And the children?

54:20.333 --> 54:23.375
This here is us warning you.

54:23.375 --> 54:24.500
You understand?

54:25.458 --> 54:26.958
Cauterize the wound, son.

54:26.958 --> 54:30.083
Or the orchard keeper
will be coming for a visit.

54:30.583 --> 54:31.625
With an axe.

54:34.041 --> 54:35.083
You hungry?

54:35.083 --> 54:38.416
Hmm? Where's that
fucking waiter?

54:38.416 --> 54:39.458
<i>Salud.</i>
