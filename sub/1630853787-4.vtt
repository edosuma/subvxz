00:04.337 --> 00:08.341
Whenever a show is cast,
it completely informs your identity.

00:08.425 --> 00:09.509
You're Anna?

00:09.592 --> 00:12.095
Gina and Kourtney are
sisters/leading ladies.

00:12.178 --> 00:13.346
Then that makes us sisters?

00:13.430 --> 00:16.391

-I know the feeling.
-(CAMPERS SNICKERING)

00:23.857 --> 00:27.652
No, I'm glad you have friends, Jet.
I'm sure Mom and Dad will be thrilled.

00:27.777 --> 00:29.320
And I'm in the ensemble.

00:29.404 --> 00:32.824
Being cast in the ensemble was unexpected.

00:32.907 --> 00:35.952
Which means, I don't know,
I'm trying to figure it out.

when Corbin Bleu is coming.

00:43.084 --> 00:45.462
I have to finish marking up this script
before tomorrow.

00:45.587 --> 00:46.880
Oh.

00:46.963 --> 00:51.384
Okay, I think he's here.
I can feel the helicopter.

Hey, I don't remember
Sharpay wearing chinos.

01:16.242 --> 01:19.412
Excuse you.
Flawless skin and sunlight do not mix.

01:19.704 --> 01:21.414
Eej, where's Corbin?

01:21.915 --> 01:25.460
Gee, I don't know. Maybe your secret
late-night hiking buddy Ricky knows. Huh?

01:26.336 --> 01:29.380
You're funny and you never
make things weird, EJ. (CHUCKLES)

01:30.173 --> 01:32.300
Look, Corbin's helicopter had
a maintenance issue.

01:32.383 --> 01:34.094
He'll be here any second.

01:34.427 --> 01:36.554
Are we totally sure about doing this?

01:36.638 --> 01:38.306
We wanna impress Corbin Bleu.

01:38.389 --> 01:40.433
And how else does one impress a person

01:40.517 --> 01:43.436
except by performing elaborate
musical numbers for them?

01:45.688 --> 01:47.398
I'm totally down to impress Corbin,

01:47.482 --> 01:50.443
but for me, this documentary
has an audience of one.

01:50.568 --> 01:52.403
My dad's cool with me taking a gap year,

01:52.487 --> 01:55.406
but I just need to show him
how productive I am.

01:55.990 --> 02:00.120
I just don't want any drama today.
Or at least as little as possible.

Everyone, act like you're taking this
serious and warming up.

05:06.347 --> 05:08.308
That is literally what they're doing, EJ.

05:08.391 --> 05:11.060

Corbin's on the clock. It's go-time.

05:18.609 --> 05:21.487
Mr. Bleu, sir. We have a killer first
read-through plan for today.

05:21.571 --> 05:25.908
-Right.
-Okay, yeah, you make the rounds, good.

05:25.992 --> 05:27.201

05:27.702 --> 05:28.703
Kourtney.

05:28.786 --> 05:30.121
Yeah.

-Scream!
-Scream!

05:33.416 --> 05:36.669
What I've learned from teen rom-coms
of the early 21st century,

05:36.753 --> 05:39.964
it's that the best way to
impress/bond with someone

05:40.048 --> 05:43.760
is to pretend that all their favorite
things are your favorite things, too.

05:44.177 --> 05:48.139
And according to <i>Teen Slam Magazine's</i>
2006 survey,

05:48.222 --> 05:51.768
Corbin's favorite colors
are gold and black.

05:51.934 --> 05:55.980
And now, so are mine.

05:56.522 --> 05:58.983
Keep warming up, gang.
We're gonna check some sound levels.

06:01.319 --> 06:05.323
Corbin, one, two, three.
Corbin, one, two, three.

06:05.406 --> 06:06.407
Yeah.

06:07.283 --> 06:09.619
So, I was summoned to the office.

06:09.702 --> 06:11.829
Hey, don't panic.
Whatever it is, I'll handle it.

06:11.913 --> 06:14.207
Dewey Wood has a few skeletons
in his closet.

06:14.290 --> 06:18.044
I'm not in trouble. My mom called.

06:20.046 --> 06:21.172
(CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY)

06:22.256 --> 06:26.052
My mom is moving back.

06:27.553 --> 06:28.554
Back?

06:28.638 --> 06:30.723
-To Salt Lake.
-What?

06:30.807 --> 06:34.310
And she rented a place in Sugar House
so she can be with me for junior year.

06:34.727 --> 06:37.772
We're gonna be actual, down-the-street
neighbors for your gap year.

06:37.855 --> 06:39.899
Like, no more Ashlyn's place across town.

06:39.982 --> 06:42.944
That's shockingly fantastic.

Of course, I'm thrilled that
Gina's gonna be close by, but...

06:50.535 --> 06:52.370
This letter just came from my dad.

06:52.870 --> 06:55.581
Apparently, he's not okay
with me taking a gap year

06:55.665 --> 07:00.294
and he's sending me to the Caswell Success
Training School... In Saint Louis.

07:01.587 --> 07:03.381
I have to figure out a way to show him

07:03.464 --> 07:05.925
that I can be successful without
going to the school...

07:06.050 --> 07:07.468
That he named after himself.

07:08.594 --> 07:11.639
Yeah, I'll tell Gina about this.
Once I figure out a way out of it.

07:12.348 --> 07:16.102
I've been kicking myself for not going
exploring with you and Ricky last night.

07:16.185 --> 07:18.271
And I know I've been distracted
with the show...

07:18.354 --> 07:21.274
It's okay. It would've been
more fun with you.

07:21.649 --> 07:24.777
But hey, it's not like we only have
this summer now, right?

07:25.319 --> 07:27.822
We can go on adventures all the time
back in Salt Lake, too.

07:27.905 --> 07:31.033
Definitely. We definitely will be seeing
each other all of the time,

07:31.117 --> 07:33.578
because of geography!

07:33.744 --> 07:34.745
(CHUCKLES)

07:34.829 --> 07:37.206
Hey, Gina, come join
the friendship circle.

07:40.334 --> 07:43.880
Okay. I was a PA on Nick Viall's
season of <i>The Bachelor.</i>

07:44.005 --> 07:45.923
These kids are too nice to each other.

07:46.007 --> 07:48.843
Which means they could crack
at any moment.

07:49.260 --> 07:52.096
Chip away at those cracks,
and we've got gold.

07:52.555 --> 07:56.350
We are the archeologists of their angst.

07:56.559 --> 07:58.519
Beautiful and somewhat haunting speech.

07:58.686 --> 08:02.356
Fun fact, not the first time
I've given it. We're rolling!

08:03.274 --> 08:05.735
Welcome to the first <i>Frozen</i> read-through.

08:05.985 --> 08:08.196
Young Elsa and Anna
are on a nature field trip,

08:08.279 --> 08:09.739
will catch up with us tomorrow.

08:09.822 --> 08:11.407
I'll take it from here, RJ, thank you.

08:11.491 --> 08:14.243
All right! Camp Shallow Lake!

08:14.327 --> 08:18.873
I am pumped to be back
for this full day of rehearsal,

08:19.582 --> 08:21.959
figured with opening night only
10 days away.

08:22.210 --> 08:26.839
Ten days away?
That's a reason to celebrate. Bring it in.

08:27.924 --> 08:29.467
(CHUCKLES) Thanks.

08:29.842 --> 08:33.095
Opening night is also my birthday
and when I was seven,

08:33.179 --> 08:36.349
I wrote a bucket list of things
I wanted to do by the time I was 18.

08:36.432 --> 08:38.935
Number eight on the list? Hug a celebrity.

08:39.101 --> 08:42.188
I tried to hug Kaycee Stroh last year
during Miss Jenn's school board thing

08:42.271 --> 08:44.774
but she disappeared like a beautiful mist.

08:45.942 --> 08:48.736
So, when will I get another opportunity
like this?

08:49.362 --> 08:55.368
Look, I understand that some of you
know me as a name and not a person.

08:55.910 --> 08:59.539
But I'm just a regular guy
who buys his groceries at Erewhon

08:59.622 --> 09:02.667
and has a personal trainer
like anybody else. All right?

09:02.875 --> 09:05.294
I'm just here to capture some
behind-the-scenes footage,

09:05.378 --> 09:10.091
so think of me as a fly on the wall.
Be yourselves. Let's have some fun. Yeah?

09:10.341 --> 09:14.345
Yeah, baby! Let's hug it out!
Bring it in, come on.

09:14.554 --> 09:15.805
And here you have it, folks.

09:15.888 --> 09:20.268
The very first camp read-through
of <i>Frozen.</i> Let the show begin.

09:24.981 --> 09:27.233
Hey, Val. I know you have
a lot on your plate.

09:27.316 --> 09:30.278
I'd be happy to read stage directions
if you need a hand.

09:30.361 --> 09:31.821
Oh, it's all good, Ash. I've got it.

09:34.448 --> 09:39.537
I know my newly recognized Leo Rising
makes me crave praise and admiration.

09:39.620 --> 09:43.583
But since Val put me in the ensemble,
I'm convinced she hates me.

09:43.749 --> 09:44.875
I mean, think about it.

09:44.959 --> 09:49.630
The beautiful blond declares her
distaste for me, the main character.

09:49.797 --> 09:54.552
Like, is this Act 1 of <i>Wicked?</i>
Is she wicked?

09:55.553 --> 09:58.347
It's not for me to say. But I just did.

09:59.724 --> 10:00.808
"Elsa?"

10:00.891 --> 10:02.810
"Anna takes a step towards Elsa."

10:03.019 --> 10:04.145
"Don't come near me."

10:04.228 --> 10:05.271
Pause.

10:07.023 --> 10:09.150
Sounds like you two
really felt that moment.

10:09.233 --> 10:10.568
Unpack what you're channeling.

10:10.651 --> 10:13.237
Let me guess.
Real-life relationship troubles.

10:13.362 --> 10:16.157
You both like the same person
and it's causing tension.

10:16.240 --> 10:19.493
Maybe it's this guy.

10:19.577 --> 10:22.788
Yes, it's me.
The notorious womanizer of the group.

10:23.164 --> 10:26.876
Uh, Mr. Bleu, if you're
looking for dirt or like,

10:27.501 --> 10:29.795
jealous in-fighting, that's just not us.

10:29.962 --> 10:31.589
We're all good friends.

10:31.714 --> 10:35.676
Yeah, like, really good friends.
We're basically a drama-free zone.

10:36.135 --> 10:39.847
Great. All those Emmy-winning
drama-free reality shows.

10:41.390 --> 10:44.852
Been in the business for over four years.

10:45.394 --> 10:48.189
Did an undergrad at Tisch, that's NYU.

10:48.981 --> 10:51.734
It's expensive,
and I did not get a scholarship.

10:51.817 --> 10:54.111
Point is, if things don't heat up soon,

10:54.195 --> 10:57.198
the only thing that's gonna be frozen
is our ratings.

10:59.075 --> 11:01.369
Yes, I came up with that on the spot,
right now.

11:01.452 --> 11:04.121
Okay. Let's just... Let's move on.

11:04.955 --> 11:07.667
"Hey, my... Ice."

11:08.000 --> 11:11.629
"Kristoff picks up his bag of ice.
Anna and Hans are oblivious."

11:12.129 --> 11:14.298
"I'm sorry, so sorry."

11:16.217 --> 11:17.385
Uh...

11:18.010 --> 11:19.345
That's Jet's line.

11:24.266 --> 11:25.518
Wait, Jet's not here.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.853
Oh, God. I knew he wasn't real.

11:28.145 --> 11:29.939
What's the deal with Jet? Is he troubled?

11:30.064 --> 11:34.360
I wouldn't say troubled. We're slowly
wearing his dark soul down.

11:35.194 --> 11:36.362
Sounds like our protagonist.

11:36.570 --> 11:39.156
Everyone loves a misanthropic
emo-boy to root for.

11:40.449 --> 11:45.579
Jet's gonna be fine. He's probably
just doing this for attention.

11:47.248 --> 11:52.086
I'm known for my impeccable straight-dar.
And Maddox is hardcore crushing on Jet.

11:52.211 --> 11:56.257
And he's clearly into her, too.
I bet that's why he ran away.

11:56.882 --> 12:02.096
He's so nervous, he can't even
be around her. Because of the lust.

12:04.390 --> 12:08.936
I'm sure Jet is fine.
Maddie, Val, please track him down.

12:09.353 --> 12:11.647
As for the rest of us, let's take a ten.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.983
I will be in the canteen having
a cool beverage,

12:14.066 --> 12:17.445
because I am very cool.
Everything is cool, Mr. Bleu.

12:17.570 --> 12:18.863
You're yelling.

12:19.697 --> 12:20.781
(SIGHS)

12:28.706 --> 12:30.416
KOURTNEY: Oh, my... (LAUGHS)

12:31.333 --> 12:32.543
RICKY: Oh!

12:36.881 --> 12:37.882
So?

12:39.133 --> 12:41.343
-Guys, we lost Jet.
-(PEOPLE AT CANTEEN GASP)

12:41.427 --> 12:42.636
-What?
-Oh.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.847
Sorry. Let me clarify.

12:44.930 --> 12:49.143
I talked to Dewey and it looks like
Jet checked out of camp and went home.

12:49.268 --> 12:53.522
He disappeared on to the open road.
A lone minor.

12:53.689 --> 12:57.109
Thumb in the wind. Hair in the wind,

12:57.193 --> 13:01.655
for either fate or foe, to take him away.
(WHISPERS) That's you.

13:01.739 --> 13:03.824
Uh, yeah, not quite.

13:04.116 --> 13:06.202
An off-duty cop found him at a bus stop

13:06.285 --> 13:08.579
and his parents came
and picked him up in a Buick.

13:08.913 --> 13:11.415
Wait, why would Jet just leave
without telling anybody?

13:13.584 --> 13:16.712
Honestly, it's not like he was
happy here anyway, right?

13:16.796 --> 13:20.466
-(RUSTLING)
-Jet? Oh, just a squirrel.

13:21.050 --> 13:24.678
So, our most interesting story's
happening off-camera.

13:25.471 --> 13:30.059
Guys. We really need to make this sing.
'Kay? Something active?

13:30.267 --> 13:31.477
<i>In Summer?</i>

13:32.019 --> 13:33.312
<i>Love Is an Open Door?</i>

13:35.815 --> 13:39.610
He just said "love," right?
Yeah, I know, it's a song title.

13:39.693 --> 13:44.740
But it sounded like... I didn't hate it.

13:45.908 --> 13:48.577
<i>Love Is an Open Door.</i>
That's the Anna and Hans song, right?

13:49.328 --> 13:51.163
And we're missing the Hans part of it.

13:51.413 --> 13:52.498
It is, but...

13:52.581 --> 13:55.292
Yeah, weirdly,
that's the one song I know. (CHUCKLES)

13:55.376 --> 13:59.213
Lily made me sing it in our second date,
but I'm happy to jump in and, you know...

13:59.296 --> 14:01.674
Thanks, kid. Just take a soft five.

14:01.757 --> 14:03.425
Gotta agree. Stay in your lane, Bowen.

14:03.509 --> 14:04.510
CORBIN: Uh...

14:05.386 --> 14:07.763
You? You look like a 1980s villain.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.431
(LAUGHS) Sorry.

14:10.307 --> 14:11.475
Thank you?

14:11.559 --> 14:14.144
You're welcome. Villains equal viewers.

14:14.770 --> 14:17.565
Kenny Ortega taught me that when
I turned down <i>The Descendants.</i>

14:17.857 --> 14:19.692
You, sing the song with Gia.

14:19.775 --> 14:21.944
(CHUCKLES) Gina.

14:22.027 --> 14:23.153
That's right.

14:23.279 --> 14:25.656
Sing the song here? In the canteen?

14:25.990 --> 14:28.200
<i>Big Brother</i> has been on the air
for 23 seasons.

14:28.450 --> 14:30.202
They haven't even left the house yet.

14:31.328 --> 14:33.038
Guys? Let's shoot somethin'.

14:34.415 --> 14:35.666
You seem stressed.

14:35.916 --> 14:38.252
Oh, thanks, Kourtney.

14:39.378 --> 14:40.546
These are my favorite.

14:40.629 --> 14:41.714
(CHUCKLES)

14:42.631 --> 14:43.757
So am I.

14:43.841 --> 14:45.467
I can jump in on piano.

14:45.551 --> 14:48.762
Oh, no worries. We already got
the backing track. So...

14:48.846 --> 14:52.808
Not worried. But here I am,
at the piano, ready to play.

14:53.225 --> 14:58.022
I like the piano. That's humble.
Let the needy girl play.

15:03.819 --> 15:05.404
I'm a little rusty as an actor.

15:05.696 --> 15:09.450
Hey, just pretend it's you and me
frolicking across a field.

15:11.285 --> 15:12.661
(PIANO PLAYING)

15:13.370 --> 15:15.998
Okay. Can I just say something crazy?

15:16.123 --> 15:17.333
I love crazy.

15:19.668 --> 15:24.006
(SINGING) <i>All my life has been</i>

15:24.089 --> 15:27.051

17:03.439 --> 17:09.153
Yeah. She's amazing.
And EJ is amazing, right?

17:09.236 --> 17:13.073
Everyone's amazing. Best cast ever.
I mean...

17:17.036 --> 17:21.707
Folks I'm gonna need some B-roll of people
acting anxious and confused, all right?

17:21.832 --> 17:23.459
We're rolling.

17:23.584 --> 17:25.544
Oh! Oh!

17:25.627 --> 17:26.754
The lean-in's good.

17:27.171 --> 17:30.841
Oh, no. Oh, no, what's happening?

17:31.258 --> 17:35.637
What's going on? Yeah.
So anxious and confused.

17:38.640 --> 17:42.770
Oh, okay. Don't wanna be in B-roll.
All right, that's fine.

17:43.395 --> 17:46.315
"It's not your fault we were caught
in a magical summer blizzard

"and no one will give us a room."

17:53.614 --> 17:55.991
"Yeah. What do they have
against reindeer?"

17:57.868 --> 17:59.536
How long have you been there?

17:59.620 --> 18:02.247
Long enough to wonder if you have
an imaginary friend.

18:02.331 --> 18:06.293
(LAUGHS) Wouldn't be the first time
we saw a ghost. Which reminds me...

18:06.919 --> 18:07.961
What's that?

18:08.087 --> 18:10.464
It's nothin'. Just a grocery list.

18:10.547 --> 18:12.549
-Yeah?
-Hey! Give me that.

18:12.633 --> 18:16.678
Thank you. Ooh!
"Things to do before I'm 18."

18:16.762 --> 18:21.475
Very intriguing.
"Eat 20 hot dogs in a row"?

18:21.934 --> 18:26.355
"Hug a celebrity."
Oh! (LAUGHS) This makes sense.

18:26.438 --> 18:28.649
This is why you keep trying
to initiate group hugs.

18:28.732 --> 18:31.944
Okay. I also love you guys.
But, yeah, that's mostly the reason.

-This is torture.

18:38.450 --> 18:42.121
-"Say yes to something that scares me."
-You get the point.

18:42.204 --> 18:45.374
Was dating Lily not a yes
to something that scares you?

18:45.457 --> 18:49.795
Funny. Very funny, Gina. Hey! Watch it.

18:49.878 --> 18:51.338
(LAUGHS) I have it.

I swear to God, if you don't let go...
I'm gonna give you five.

-You're gonna do what? What are gonna do?
-Five, four...

I love how seriously
you always take Movie Nights.

Maddox isn't the only one
who appreciates camp traditions.

19:09.898 --> 19:12.484
Are you still thinking about
your dad's letter?

19:13.569 --> 19:16.405
My whole life, I've been burdened by
what kind of man my dad is.

19:17.030 --> 19:19.074
He's a corporation with a heartbeat.

19:20.409 --> 19:23.287
But what if I could somehow harness that?
And exploit it.

19:23.370 --> 19:25.455
Show him that I'm a success
while I'm here at camp.

19:25.664 --> 19:26.999
Like direct a great show?

19:27.082 --> 19:30.502
Well, he doesn't care about musicals,
but television,

19:30.752 --> 19:34.339
that's a whole other arena.
That's the big time.

19:35.591 --> 19:38.010
Do I sound crazy?
I might be goin' crazy right now.

19:38.093 --> 19:41.096
Hey, you have a girlfriend
to have these kinds of talks with, buddy.

19:41.346 --> 19:44.725
Be a grown-up and tell Gina that you're
going through something with your dad.

19:44.808 --> 19:47.978
-Yeah if she isn't busy with someone else.
-Uh, incoming.

19:48.187 --> 19:51.273
There you are.
I was just heading back to rehearsals.

19:53.859 --> 19:55.277

19:55.444 --> 19:59.406
Yeah, everything's perfect. Come on.

and the camera guy pacing by an oak tree.

Nah. I don't think they want what
I'm sellin'. (CHUCKLES)

20:34.107 --> 20:37.027
Must be nice having someone
waiting for you back at home.

20:37.444 --> 20:38.528
What about you?

20:38.612 --> 20:42.157
I used to. Yeah.
Here at camp, actually. Madison.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.242
(CHUCKLES)

20:43.325 --> 20:46.286
We were kind of camp royalty. Mad and Mad.

20:46.828 --> 20:49.248
Yeah. But, you know, now it's complicated.

20:49.331 --> 20:53.502
What's ironic, though, is that for
the longest time we hated each other.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.587
But you were obsessed with each other.

20:55.671 --> 20:56.797
-Yeah.
-Of course.

20:56.880 --> 20:59.007
The classic Jane Austen marriage plot.

20:59.091 --> 21:00.717
I guess so. (LAUGHS)

21:03.553 --> 21:05.389
I should go check in with Val.

21:05.472 --> 21:07.432
See if she needs any help with
the Movie Night.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.476
Save me a seat?

21:12.104 --> 21:14.147
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

21:20.862 --> 21:22.990
Okay. We'll make this quick, team.

21:23.282 --> 21:24.950
Yeah, EJ, give them a generic goodbye

21:25.033 --> 21:27.077
so that we can help the audience
with timeline.

21:27.160 --> 21:28.537
It doesn't matter what you say.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.122
-Through camera or...
-To them.

Fun fact, I weirdly never
saw that one, so...

22:26.386 --> 22:31.016
Corbin Blue is just a character in
a documentary. He can't hurt me.

but I'm just so happy I get to go back
to my own home. Moms are the best.

22:52.120 --> 22:55.374
For real. I just got a bomb care package
from my mom.

comfort movie, brand-new hair gel.

I know you already picked out
tonight's movie,

the girlfriend thing before,

24:16.913 --> 24:19.374
so I couldn't tell if it was
something off with him,

24:19.458 --> 24:21.668
or if it's me, and if he said something...

24:21.751 --> 24:26.590
He didn't have to. I can tell.
You're good people.

24:30.552 --> 24:33.054
This isn't complicated at all.

24:38.894 --> 24:40.812
The prodigal son returns.

24:41.563 --> 24:44.065
You know, Corbin and his doc crew
were actually considering

24:44.149 --> 24:46.776
making you the tortured protagonist
of the documentary.

24:47.194 --> 24:49.488
It's okay,
I really don't feel like talking.

24:49.571 --> 24:53.074
-I just wanted to grab somethin' to eat.
-We were all really worried about you.

24:54.493 --> 24:58.079
EJ, Ricky. And I've never seen
Maddox so upset.

24:58.371 --> 25:01.082
Well, I'm back now.
Everyone can stop crying.

25:01.374 --> 25:04.544
You ditched your castmates
during a really important rehearsal.

25:04.753 --> 25:06.796
EJ had to sing <i>Love Is an Open Door.</i>

25:06.880 --> 25:08.590
Sounds like I'm pretty replaceable.

25:08.673 --> 25:09.883
So prove you're not.

25:37.077 --> 25:39.246
<i>And there's a way to talk to a person,</i>
<i>and that's not it.</i>

25:39.329 --> 25:42.457
Isn't this amazing? Val is the coolest.

25:42.541 --> 25:45.710
Yeah. Of course
she's an event-planning genius, too.

25:46.002 --> 25:48.922
I even heard her give some amazing
tough-love advice to that Jet kid.

25:49.005 --> 25:50.215
Wait, he's back?

25:50.423 --> 25:52.926
Uh, yeah.
Apparently, his parents sent him back

25:53.009 --> 25:55.804
and Val was all, "Prove them wrong."

And like, does her hair have to be
so perfect every single day?

26:00.892 --> 26:03.853
It's like, we're in the woods.
Not a shampoo commercial.

26:03.937 --> 26:07.941
And it's so perfectly shiny and brushed,
like, all of the time. It's like...

26:08.024 --> 26:09.359
Shh!

26:09.484 --> 26:10.652

-(CAMPERS LAUGHING)

26:17.534 --> 26:21.329
So, the way that Ashlyn is talking about
Val sounds a lot like the way

26:21.413 --> 26:24.165
I used to talk about Madison,
is all I'm saying.

26:24.874 --> 26:28.461
But Ashlyn said she hates people
telling her about herself.

26:28.795 --> 26:31.172
So, guess I'm just gonna have to
keep my mouth shut.

26:32.632 --> 26:34.759
Which is famously hard for me.
(CLEARS THROAT)

26:38.513 --> 26:45.061
Oh, my gosh. I could never live a lie
like this. It seems wildly complicated.

26:46.021 --> 26:48.607
Well, it's not like this
character's exactly lying.

26:48.690 --> 26:52.068
She's just not telling everyone
the whole truth about her situation.

26:52.152 --> 26:56.156
Mmm. Also known as lying.
Yeah, I do not do well with liars.

27:06.499 --> 27:09.377
Yeah, I'll her about the letter
after the movie. I swear.

27:15.133 --> 27:16.259
Whoa!

27:18.803 --> 27:24.267
I thought this would be empty.
Didn't see the camouflage. You're back?

27:24.726 --> 27:28.396
Look, I already got a lecture from Val,
and I really don't need one from you.

27:29.481 --> 27:30.982
Hope the movie was fun.

27:31.483 --> 27:33.902
We were counting on you, dude.

27:34.361 --> 27:38.114
I mean, Gina was counting on you.
She finally got the lead.

27:38.907 --> 27:42.285
It means a lot. You can't not show up.

27:43.453 --> 27:44.496
What?

27:44.913 --> 27:45.997
Just curious.

27:46.081 --> 27:50.085
Are you actually this upset that
I took off or is this really about Gina?

27:51.586 --> 27:55.465
I just want what's best for her, dude.
She's my friend.

27:55.590 --> 27:58.009
Right. You guys are friends.

27:58.593 --> 28:00.303
I can hear the air quotes.

28:00.929 --> 28:01.971
Good.

28:03.515 --> 28:07.310
I know you mean well, dude,
but you don't know the full story, okay?

No. Um... Maybe.

<i>But you'll settle in.</i>

28:42.429 --> 28:46.683
When, Mom? I mean, I miss Nini,
but I have my other friends.

28:46.766 --> 28:50.270
And Corbin Bleu knows my name,
which is friend-adjacent and I'm Elsa.

28:50.645 --> 28:52.272
I should be having a great time.

<i>You feel how you feel.</i>

28:59.195 --> 29:00.488
I miss your cooking.

29:00.780 --> 29:04.033
And I miss my bedroom, and Slices,

29:04.117 --> 29:06.578
and Howie's probably kissing
all sorts of girls in college,

29:06.661 --> 29:08.997
and he hasn't even started
actual classes yet.

29:09.456 --> 29:15.170
I just, I don't really like being away
from home. Which...

29:15.628 --> 29:18.840
Which is silly, because what happens
when I start college in a year?

29:18.923 --> 29:21.009
I mean, that's if I even get into college.

29:21.217 --> 29:23.720
My grades are good,
but what about extracurriculars?

29:23.803 --> 29:25.638
Should I be volunteering at nonprofits?

29:25.722 --> 29:28.767

that I'm only applying to Ivys?

and it's not getting better.

29:44.365 --> 29:46.993
I mean... Maybe you were right.

29:47.076 --> 29:50.455
Maybe I do need to talk to someone?

was a little bit of a mess,

30:52.600 --> 30:54.102
but we pulled it together, right?

30:54.185 --> 30:56.896
We were pretty much perfect in the end.
You said so yourself.

30:57.188 --> 30:58.690
That's kind of the problem.

We don't want you to be perfect.

to be successful,

31:05.029 --> 31:06.948
we need reality show stuff.
