WEBVTT

02:10.422 --> 02:12.924
Gotta be ready before nightfall.

02:14.676 --> 02:15.802
Now keep it moving.

02:20.974 --> 02:24.393
Put a watch on the ridge
and the tree lines.

02:26.563 --> 02:27.772
Boy.

02:28.941 --> 02:30.358
Lovely boy.

02:30.943 --> 02:32.652
What do you want?

02:32.736 --> 02:34.320
A man has a thirst.

02:34.404 --> 02:37.406
A man does not drink for a day and a night.

02:37.533 --> 02:39.408
A boy could make a friend.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.035
I have friends.

02:42.037 --> 02:44.038
Give us beer before I skin you.

02:45.082 --> 02:47.250
A man does not choose his companions.

02:47.334 --> 02:49.293
These two, they have no courtesy.

02:49.378 --> 02:51.420
A man must ask forgiveness.

02:54.550 --> 02:56.342
You're called Arry?

02:59.054 --> 03:01.597
This man has the honor to be Jaqen H'ghar,

03:01.765 --> 03:03.349
once of the Free City of Lorath...

03:03.433 --> 03:06.644
Beer, you little shit. Get us beer!

03:07.938 --> 03:09.522
You should have asked nicely.

03:09.606 --> 03:10.606
Aah!

03:14.778 --> 03:15.945
Come closer...

03:16.446 --> 03:18.656
and I'll shove that stick up your bunghole

03:18.740 --> 03:20.575
and fuck you bloody.

03:20.659 --> 03:23.119
That boy has more courage than sense.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.287
Come here!

03:24.538 --> 03:25.955
Yoren said none of us were
to go near those three.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.206
Come here!

03:27.291 --> 03:28.499
They don't scare me.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.626
Hmm? Then you're stupid.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.545
They scare me.

03:36.967 --> 03:39.760
What are gold cloaks
doing so far from King's Landing?

03:44.808 --> 03:46.058
What are you doing?

03:46.143 --> 03:47.476
They're looking for me.

03:48.312 --> 03:49.687
You in command here?

03:51.189 --> 03:53.190
You're a long way from home.

03:53.275 --> 03:55.276
I asked you a question.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.986
Aye, you did.

03:58.113 --> 04:00.281
You asked without manners

04:01.116 --> 04:02.742
and I chose not to answer.

04:03.201 --> 04:04.535
I have a royal warrant

04:05.996 --> 04:09.040
for one of these gutter rats
you're transporting.

04:12.669 --> 04:14.211
Well, the thing is...

04:15.172 --> 04:18.341
these gutter rats belong
to the Night's Watch now.

04:18.466 --> 04:21.552
That puts them beyond the reach
of kings and queens.

04:21.637 --> 04:23.179
Does it?

04:24.056 --> 04:25.556
It's a funny thing,

04:25.641 --> 04:27.683
people worry so much about their throats

04:27.768 --> 04:30.186
that they forget about what's down low.

04:31.271 --> 04:34.899
Now, I sharpened this blade before breakfast.

04:35.442 --> 04:38.986
I could shave a spider's arse if I wanted to.

04:39.738 --> 04:43.616
Or... l could nick this artery in your leg.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.701
And once it's nicked,

04:45.786 --> 04:48.829
there's no one around here
who knows how to un-nick it.

04:49.998 --> 04:52.041
We'll just keep that.

04:53.502 --> 04:56.337
Good steel is always needed on the Wall.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.131
Seems you have a choice,

04:59.216 --> 05:03.469
you can die here at this crossroads
a long way from home,

05:03.553 --> 05:06.263
or you can go back to your city
and tell your masters

05:06.348 --> 05:08.766
you didn't find what you were looking for.

05:15.357 --> 05:17.024
We're looking for a boy named Gendry.

05:17.109 --> 05:19.402
He carries a bull's head helmet.

05:20.696 --> 05:24.740
Anyone turning him over
will earn the King's reward.

05:24.825 --> 05:27.410
We'll be back with more men

05:27.744 --> 05:30.871
and I'll be taking your head home
along with that bastard boy.

06:07.117 --> 06:08.075
My lord.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.827
You make me wait a long time,

06:09.911 --> 06:11.829
but your friend keeps me company.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.832
We were just speaking of your bravery

06:15.042 --> 06:17.626
in the victory against
the Stark auxiliary forces.

06:18.962 --> 06:20.296
It was quite a battle.

06:21.631 --> 06:24.675
I heard you suffered a terrible head wound.

06:25.302 --> 06:28.304
The northerners are such fearsome warriors.

06:28.680 --> 06:31.098
And I tell him the story of how we meet.

06:31.933 --> 06:35.853
To find so lovely a creature
working in your father's kitchens...

06:36.605 --> 06:38.272
It almost beggars belief.

06:39.316 --> 06:40.816
Strange things do happen.

06:41.985 --> 06:43.861
You should taste her fish pie.

06:44.112 --> 06:46.447
I don't think Lord Varys likes fish pie.

06:46.531 --> 06:49.658
- How can you tell?
- I can always tell.

06:50.160 --> 06:53.788
Men like Lord Varys and I can't let
our disadvantages get the best of us.

06:53.872 --> 06:55.748
We'll make a fisherman of him yet.

06:56.792 --> 07:01.003
I am glad your new friend
was able to accompany you to the capital.

07:01.922 --> 07:04.882
Friends are such an important part of life.

07:05.926 --> 07:08.594
Unfortunate that your father
didn't want her to come.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.097
But rest easy, my lord.

07:11.932 --> 07:15.518
I am very good at keeping secrets
for my good friends.

07:16.353 --> 07:18.104
Your discretion is legendary...

07:18.396 --> 07:20.189
Where your friends are concerned.

07:20.273 --> 07:24.860
How unspeakable of me to go on and on
when all you want to do is rest.

07:24.986 --> 07:26.070
I will leave you.

07:28.615 --> 07:30.783
Welcome to King's Landing, my dear.

07:30.867 --> 07:33.744
This city is made brighter by your presence.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.955
We have a council meeting, my lord.

07:39.668 --> 07:41.794
I don't like threats.

07:42.170 --> 07:43.295
Who threatened you?

07:43.380 --> 07:46.340
I'm not Ned Stark.
I understand the way this game is played.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.092
Ned Stark was a man of honor.

07:48.176 --> 07:49.385
And I am not.

07:49.469 --> 07:52.471
Threaten me again
and I'll have you thrown into the sea.

07:56.393 --> 07:58.602
You might be disappointed in the results.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.355
Storms come and go,

08:01.731 --> 08:03.691
the big fish eat the little fish,

08:03.775 --> 08:06.443
and I keep on paddling.

08:08.238 --> 08:09.238
Come, my lord.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.283
We shouldn't keep the queen waiting.

08:17.747 --> 08:19.582
CERSEl: "From this time until the end of time,

08:19.666 --> 08:21.417
"we are not part of your realm,

08:21.501 --> 08:24.712
"but a free and independent
Kingdom of the North."

08:29.092 --> 08:31.468
He has more spirit than his father,
I'll give him that.

08:31.553 --> 08:34.304
You've perfected the art of tearing up papers.

08:35.222 --> 08:37.349
We can give him his father's bones back,
at least,

08:37.433 --> 08:39.184
as a gesture of good faith.

08:39.436 --> 08:41.352
You'll give the Starks our reply, cousin?

08:42.438 --> 08:43.856
I will, Your Grace.

08:45.442 --> 08:47.985
Did you see my brother
when you were the Starks' guest?

08:48.069 --> 08:49.361
I did.

08:49.446 --> 08:51.739
They have not broken his spirit, Your Grace.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.992
If you speak with him,

08:55.952 --> 08:57.953
tell him he's not been forgotten.

08:58.788 --> 09:00.956
- I will, Your Grace.
- Safe travels, cousin.

09:05.962 --> 09:07.796
You have a deft hand with diplomacy.

09:08.006 --> 09:09.590
If that's everything...

09:09.966 --> 09:14.053
A raven flew in this morning
from Castle Black.

09:14.804 --> 09:16.347
Trouble with the wildlings.

09:16.973 --> 09:18.933
That's why they're called "wildlings."

09:19.142 --> 09:21.310
Somewhat less wild these days.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.938
Seems they've stopped killing each other

09:24.022 --> 09:26.732
and started following
this king-beyond-the-Wall.

09:27.025 --> 09:29.235
Another king? How many is that now?

09:29.319 --> 09:31.403
Five? I've lost count.

09:31.488 --> 09:35.074
The Lord Commander asks
that we send more men to man the Wall.

09:35.158 --> 09:38.619
Perhaps he's forgotten we're fighting a war.
We have no men to spare.

09:38.745 --> 09:42.915
"The cold winds are rising
and the dead rise with them."

09:43.625 --> 09:46.669
The northerners are a superstitious people.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.837
According to the Commander,

09:48.922 --> 09:51.090
one of these dead men
attacked him in his chambers.

09:51.174 --> 09:52.675
Mormont doesn't lie.

09:53.802 --> 09:55.761
How do you kill a dead man?

09:56.972 --> 09:58.514
Apparently you burn him.

10:00.016 --> 10:04.937
One trip to the Wall and you come back
believing in grumpkins and snarks.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.690
I don't know what I believe,

10:08.858 --> 10:10.567
but here's a fact for you:

10:10.777 --> 10:12.486
the Night's Watch is the only thing

10:12.570 --> 10:15.155
that separates us from
what lies beyond the Wall.

10:15.240 --> 10:19.702
I have every confidence that the brave men
of the Night's Watch will protect us all.

10:22.247 --> 10:25.124
And I said,
"if the gods wanted us to have dignity,

10:25.208 --> 10:27.501
"they wouldn't make us fart when we died."

10:29.754 --> 10:31.255
We fart when we die?

10:32.382 --> 10:33.757
My blessed mother,

10:33.842 --> 10:36.385
I was holding her hand
when she left this world.

10:36.720 --> 10:40.222
She farted so hard, the whole bed shook.

10:49.357 --> 10:52.609
Seems a bit greedy for one man
to have so many wives.

10:52.694 --> 10:55.112
Wouldn't two or three be enough for him?

10:55.196 --> 10:57.364
We were having a serious discussion.

10:59.659 --> 11:00.993
Would you look at that?

11:03.079 --> 11:05.247
Nothing like the sight
of a woman walking away.

11:05.874 --> 11:07.875
I prefer watching them come towards me.

11:08.918 --> 11:10.294
I'm sure that's nice, too.

11:10.378 --> 11:15.966
Yeah, well, there was a milkmaid named Violet
on the next farm over from where I grew up.

11:16.051 --> 11:19.094
We were wrestling together
from the time we were six years old.

11:20.180 --> 11:24.058
And then we got older and the wrestling...

11:25.685 --> 11:27.061
changed.

11:27.604 --> 11:28.771
You were with her?

11:29.939 --> 11:31.148
How many times?

11:31.941 --> 11:33.609
Well, as many times as I could.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.114
I wish I grew up on a farm.

11:39.616 --> 11:43.327
We need more potatoes.
Get another sack from the sledge.

11:46.915 --> 11:49.041
Get the turnips, too.

12:00.553 --> 12:03.389
No. Ghost, no.

12:03.973 --> 12:05.182
No!

12:07.060 --> 12:08.644
Ghost, away. Shoo. Shoo!

12:13.358 --> 12:14.817
You all right?

12:15.443 --> 12:18.028
- Did he frighten you?
- You shouldn't touch me.

12:18.571 --> 12:19.780
Oh.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.615
Oh, right.

12:21.699 --> 12:23.242
I'm sorry.

12:23.326 --> 12:26.203
I just wanted to make sure you weren't hurt.

12:32.710 --> 12:34.545
You're very brave.

12:44.514 --> 12:46.515
What are you doing?

12:46.850 --> 12:48.475
This is Gilly.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.602
She's one of Craster's daughters.

12:51.688 --> 12:53.397
Hello, Gilly. What are you doing?

12:53.481 --> 12:54.898
Sam said you could help.

12:55.024 --> 12:56.608
I'm sorry, but Sam knows
we're not supposed...

12:56.693 --> 12:58.068
She's pregnant.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.619
We have to take her with us when we leave.

13:07.704 --> 13:09.455
What?

13:09.539 --> 13:11.457
- What would that...
- I know it sounds a bit mad.

13:11.541 --> 13:13.125
No, it doesn't sound a bit mad,
it's impossible.

13:13.209 --> 13:16.128
- The Lord Commander ordered us to...
- We are sworn to protect.

13:16.212 --> 13:18.005
- Sam, we can't take...
- Please, sir, please.

13:18.089 --> 13:19.965
I can still run if I have to.

13:20.049 --> 13:22.384
- It's just not possible.
- I'm going to have a baby.

13:22.469 --> 13:23.552
If it's a boy...

13:25.013 --> 13:26.805
if it's a boy, what?

13:32.061 --> 13:36.356
You want us to risk our lives for you
and you won't even tell us why?

13:42.113 --> 13:45.157
- Why'd you do that?
- Do what? Ask her a question?

13:45.241 --> 13:47.034
- You were cruel.
- Cruel?

13:47.118 --> 13:49.036
Sam, are you in such a hurry to lose a hand?

13:49.120 --> 13:51.330
- I didn't touch her.
- No, you just want to steal her.

13:51.414 --> 13:53.040
What do you think Craster cuts off for that?

13:53.124 --> 13:57.294
I can't steal her. She's a person, not a goat.

14:02.425 --> 14:05.844
We're heading
deeper and deeper into wildling territory.

14:05.929 --> 14:08.639
We can't take a girl with us.
Mormont wouldn't have it.

14:08.723 --> 14:11.600
And even if he would,
what would we do with her?

14:11.684 --> 14:13.477
Who's going to deliver a baby, you?

14:14.729 --> 14:15.729
I could try.

14:16.773 --> 14:18.732
What? I've read about it.

14:20.276 --> 14:21.360
A bit.

14:23.446 --> 14:24.780
I'm sorry, Sam.

14:26.157 --> 14:27.324
We can't help her.

15:24.132 --> 15:25.465
Khaleesi.

16:11.220 --> 16:13.847
- You don't need to see this.
- He is blood of my blood.

16:17.393 --> 16:20.354
- Who did this?
- Khal Pono, perhaps.

16:20.438 --> 16:22.689
Khal Jhaqo.

16:22.774 --> 16:25.942
They don't like the idea of a woman
leading a khalasar.

16:26.027 --> 16:28.987
They will like it far less
when I am done with them.

16:40.375 --> 16:42.876
They killed his soul!

16:44.837 --> 16:47.130
Shh. They cannot kill his soul.

16:47.882 --> 16:49.132
They did!

16:49.592 --> 16:51.593
They butchered him like an animal.

16:52.720 --> 16:55.430
They did not burn his body.

16:55.723 --> 17:00.435
He can neverjoin his ancestors
in the night lands.

17:01.521 --> 17:04.606
Shh. We will build him a funeral pyre.

17:11.571 --> 17:12.989
And I promise you,

17:13.741 --> 17:15.992
Rakharo will ride with his ancestors tonight.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.248
Is it as you remember, my lord?

18:03.875 --> 18:05.417
It looks smaller.

18:05.501 --> 18:07.335
Everything looks bigger when you're a child.

18:07.420 --> 18:11.256
I remember my father's cabin
felt like a palace when I was little.

18:11.549 --> 18:14.593
Now look at it.

18:14.677 --> 18:16.928
They'll be waiting for me on the docks.

18:17.013 --> 18:18.680
Who will?

18:18.765 --> 18:20.599
Anyone who matters.

18:20.683 --> 18:22.726
This is a big day for them.

18:22.810 --> 18:26.271
They haven't had much to get
excited about since I left.

18:26.355 --> 18:28.440
It's a hard place, the Iron lslands.

18:28.524 --> 18:29.983
Always has been.

18:30.067 --> 18:32.277
It's cold and it's wet.

18:32.653 --> 18:34.029
Oh, I love the cold and wet.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.531
They say hard places breed hard men.

18:38.367 --> 18:40.285
And hard men rule the world.

18:43.080 --> 18:45.332
Then you'll be king before long.

18:47.668 --> 18:50.462
Try smiling with your lips closed.

18:51.714 --> 18:52.714
Better.

18:55.760 --> 18:58.637
My father doesn't trust you Iron lslanders.

18:58.721 --> 19:00.639
I don't blame him.

19:00.723 --> 19:03.725
He says that you're all reavers and rapers

19:03.810 --> 19:05.644
and that no matter
how many women you have,

19:05.728 --> 19:07.813
you'll never be sat...

19:07.897 --> 19:09.856
Quit talking about your father.

19:11.025 --> 19:13.151
But he's right about us.

19:13.986 --> 19:17.572
Our wives from the Iron lslands,
they're for breeding.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.866
That's not enough for us.

19:19.951 --> 19:23.995
That's why we take salt wives,
the women we capture.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.497
Capture me.

19:25.581 --> 19:27.666
Take me with you when you go ashore.

19:27.750 --> 19:31.837
- Make me your salt wife.
- Your place is on this ship.

19:31.921 --> 19:33.964
Not after you leave.

19:34.048 --> 19:37.843
Father will punish me. He'll call me a whore.

19:39.095 --> 19:41.429
I haven't paid you.

19:53.943 --> 19:55.026
Oh, yeah.

20:05.538 --> 20:08.206
I paid good money...

20:17.967 --> 20:20.093
I'm not going to stand for this.

20:20.177 --> 20:21.887
I barely touched her.

20:21.971 --> 20:24.472
Now, you charge twice as much
as every other brothel

20:24.557 --> 20:25.932
and this is what I get, crying.

20:26.017 --> 20:28.351
One moment, my friend. A moment.

20:37.862 --> 20:39.988
Please accept my sincerest apologies.

20:40.072 --> 20:42.490
Aremca will take good care of you.

21:12.396 --> 21:14.105
I'm sorry, my lord.

21:18.194 --> 21:19.486
Did he hurt you?

21:21.530 --> 21:22.530
No, my lord.

21:25.493 --> 21:26.576
It's Mhaegen.

21:27.161 --> 21:28.203
Who?

21:30.206 --> 21:31.706
She works for you.

21:33.250 --> 21:34.376
She's the one...

21:35.044 --> 21:36.795
The gold cloaks,

21:36.879 --> 21:39.547
- they killed her baby.
- Ah, yes.

21:39.632 --> 21:40.966
That was...

21:41.884 --> 21:43.301
poorly handled.

21:45.638 --> 21:49.224
Sometimes those with the most power
have the least grace.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.228
I can't stop thinking about it.

21:54.188 --> 21:55.730
I can't sleep.

21:57.984 --> 21:59.567
Her poor little baby.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.904
You know, you remind me of another girl,

22:04.156 --> 22:07.742
a lovely thing I once acquired
from a Lysene pleasure house.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.871
Beautiful, like yourself,

22:11.956 --> 22:15.333
and intelligent, like yourself.

22:16.293 --> 22:17.836
But she wasn't happy.

22:19.922 --> 22:22.132
She cried often.

22:22.967 --> 22:24.467
I asked her why,

22:26.595 --> 22:29.514
but we didn't have the kind of rapport
that you and I have.

22:33.227 --> 22:35.103
Yes, it was quite sad.

22:37.440 --> 22:40.608
Girls from the Lysene pleasure houses
are expensive,

22:40.693 --> 22:42.277
extremely expensive.

22:42.987 --> 22:45.697
And this one wasn't making me any money.

22:50.327 --> 22:52.495
I hate bad investments.

22:53.372 --> 22:54.873
Really, I do.

22:56.917 --> 22:58.126
They haunt me.

23:02.256 --> 23:04.257
I had no idea how to make her happy,

23:05.676 --> 23:08.261
no idea how to mitigate my losses.

23:10.222 --> 23:14.059
A very wealthy patron,
he offered me a tremendous amount of money

23:14.143 --> 23:15.977
to let him transform

23:16.062 --> 23:19.147
this lovely, sad girl.

23:19.815 --> 23:21.649
To use her in ways

23:22.902 --> 23:24.861
that would never occur to most men.

23:27.073 --> 23:29.074
But you know what occurs to most men.

23:33.412 --> 23:36.164
I would not say he succeeded
in making her happy,

23:38.209 --> 23:41.836
but my losses were definitely mitigated.

23:50.513 --> 23:52.680
Take tonight off to mourn Mhaegen's child.

23:54.475 --> 23:55.809
I'll see you tomorrow.

23:56.852 --> 23:58.186
And you'll be happy?

24:02.441 --> 24:03.858
That makes me happy.

24:16.831 --> 24:17.872
More wine?

24:19.083 --> 24:21.126
- Damn it, boy!
- Apologies, my lord.

24:21.210 --> 24:24.420
Leave us, Podrick.
I believe we know how to pour our own wine.

24:25.965 --> 24:27.632
That's your new squire?

24:27.716 --> 24:29.676
I could've found you a proper lad.

24:29.760 --> 24:32.762
Myself, I prefer the improper ones.

24:33.514 --> 24:35.431
That's a good red. Dornish?

24:35.516 --> 24:36.933
You know your wines, my lord.

24:37.017 --> 24:38.560
That I do.

24:39.562 --> 24:41.187
A fine dinner, my lord.

24:41.272 --> 24:42.897
Call me Tyrion, please.

24:43.357 --> 24:46.776
I'm sure you're getting used to fine dinners,
now that you're a lord.

24:46.861 --> 24:48.695
Maybe I'll hire this cook of yours.

24:48.821 --> 24:51.322
Wars have been started for less.

24:52.741 --> 24:55.451
I heard there was some trouble
in Littlefinger's brothel the other night.

24:55.536 --> 24:56.578
Mmm.

24:57.079 --> 24:58.037
Nasty business.

24:58.122 --> 24:59.956
- Had to be done.
- Yes, of course.

25:00.040 --> 25:01.875
The City Watch must keep the peace.

25:02.251 --> 25:05.879
Only, I hadn't realized
peace depended on killing babies.

25:07.256 --> 25:09.591
- Orders are orders.
- Quite right.

25:09.758 --> 25:11.759
Especially the Queen's orders.

25:11.969 --> 25:13.553
I never said they were the Queen's orders.

25:13.637 --> 25:17.390
No, but who else would want
to murder King Robert's bastards?

25:18.184 --> 25:19.767
She's always been a jealous woman.

25:19.852 --> 25:21.519
You know your sister better than I do.

25:21.604 --> 25:23.897
You've heard the awful rumors
about my brother and sister?

25:23.981 --> 25:25.607
I don't listen to filth.

25:25.691 --> 25:28.484
That's good of you, but you have heard them.

25:29.028 --> 25:31.863
I suppose people who do believe that filth
consider Robert's bastards

25:31.947 --> 25:34.449
to be better claimants to the throne
than Cersei's children.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.492
Joffrey is my king.
The rest doesn't interest me.

25:36.619 --> 25:38.620
I appreciate your loyalty.

25:40.414 --> 25:44.334
Tell me, when your men
slaughtered Ned Stark's men

25:44.418 --> 25:47.337
in the throne room, did you give the order?

25:48.714 --> 25:49.797
I did.

25:50.299 --> 25:52.050
And I would again.

25:52.134 --> 25:53.927
The man was a traitor.

25:54.011 --> 25:55.887
He tried to buy my loyalty.

25:55.971 --> 25:57.347
The fool.

25:58.098 --> 26:00.225
He had no idea you were already bought.

26:00.768 --> 26:02.060
Are you drunk?

26:02.561 --> 26:04.771
I'll not have my honor questioned by an imp!

26:05.314 --> 26:08.149
I'm not questioning your honor, Lord Janos.

26:08.859 --> 26:10.568
I'm denying its existence.

26:10.653 --> 26:13.738
If you think I'll stand here
and take this from you, dwarf...

26:13.822 --> 26:16.616
Dwarf? You should have stopped at imp.

26:16.700 --> 26:19.202
And, yes, you will stand here
and take it from me,

26:19.286 --> 26:21.704
unless you'd like to take it
from my friend here.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.457
I intend to serve as Hand of the King

26:24.541 --> 26:26.084
until my father returns from the war.

26:26.168 --> 26:28.378
And seeing as you betrayed
the last Hand of the King,

26:28.462 --> 26:31.256
well, I just wouldn't feel safe
with you lurking about.

26:31.465 --> 26:32.882
What are you...

26:32.967 --> 26:34.926
My friends at court will not allow this!

26:35.010 --> 26:37.011
- The Queen herself has granted...
- The Queen Regent.

26:37.096 --> 26:39.639
And you're a fool to believe she is your friend.

26:40.307 --> 26:41.975
We shall hear what Joffrey
has to say about this.

26:42.059 --> 26:43.184
No, we shan't.

26:50.734 --> 26:54.112
There's a ship leaving
for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea tonight.

26:54.196 --> 26:57.657
From there, I'm afraid,
it's rather a long walk to Castle Black.

26:57.741 --> 26:59.200
I hope you enjoy the Wall.

26:59.952 --> 27:02.328
I found it surprisingly beautiful...

27:02.871 --> 27:06.291
in a brutal, horribly uncomfortable
sort of way.

27:06.792 --> 27:08.209
The lads will escort you.

27:08.294 --> 27:10.461
The streets aren't safe at night, my lord.

27:10.546 --> 27:12.213
These men are under my command!

27:12.840 --> 27:14.924
I command you to arrest this cutthroat.

27:15.009 --> 27:16.634
His name is Bronn,

27:16.719 --> 27:19.095
and he is the new commander
of the City Watch.

27:19.471 --> 27:20.471
Boys.

27:21.765 --> 27:25.226
I have friends at court,

27:25.311 --> 27:27.061
powerful friends!

27:27.980 --> 27:30.398
The king himself made me a lord!

27:35.237 --> 27:37.447
To the new commander.

27:43.579 --> 27:47.540
If I told you to murder an infant girl, say,

27:47.624 --> 27:49.625
still at her mother's breast,

27:50.961 --> 27:52.795
would you do it without question?

27:55.215 --> 27:57.425
Without question? No.

27:58.260 --> 27:59.427
I'd ask, "How much?"

28:17.738 --> 28:19.947
if they come back, I say we yield.

28:20.032 --> 28:21.449
Gendry's the one they want.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.284
Don't want to get caught
in the middle of a battle.

28:23.369 --> 28:25.036
I ain't afraid of no battles.

28:25.120 --> 28:27.747
If you got within a mile of a battle,
you'd fill your pants.

28:27.831 --> 28:29.290
I've seen lots of battles.

28:29.375 --> 28:31.042
- I saw...
- Liar.

28:31.126 --> 28:33.252
I saw a man kill another man

28:33.337 --> 28:35.755
just outside a tavern in Flea Bottom.

28:35.839 --> 28:38.091
Stabbed him right in the neck.

28:38.175 --> 28:40.468
Two men fighting isn't a battle.

28:41.011 --> 28:43.638
- They had armor on.
- So?

28:44.181 --> 28:46.349
So, if they've got armor on, it's a battle.

28:46.433 --> 28:47.809
No, it isn't.

28:48.310 --> 28:51.020
What does a dyer's apprentice
know about battles anyway?

28:51.105 --> 28:53.147
Gendry's an armorer's apprentice.

28:53.232 --> 28:56.150
Hot Pie, tell Gendry
what makes a fight into a battle.

28:57.986 --> 29:00.488
It's when they've got armor on.

29:00.572 --> 29:02.240
Who told you that?

29:03.492 --> 29:04.784
A knight.

29:05.619 --> 29:07.286
How'd you know he was a knight?

29:08.831 --> 29:11.874
Well, it was 'cause he'd got armor on.

29:11.959 --> 29:14.001
You don't have to be a knight to have armor.

29:14.086 --> 29:15.503
Any idiot can buy armor.

29:16.004 --> 29:17.630
How do you know?

29:17.923 --> 29:19.382
'Cause I sold armor.

29:32.729 --> 29:34.605
What do the gold cloaks want with you?

29:34.690 --> 29:36.607
- No idea.
- You're a liar.

29:36.692 --> 29:39.360
You know, you shouldn't
insult people that are bigger than you.

29:39.445 --> 29:42.029
Then I wouldn't get to insult anyone.

29:42.114 --> 29:44.115
I don't care what any of them want.

29:44.199 --> 29:46.159
No good's ever come of their questions.

29:46.243 --> 29:48.244
No good's ever come?

29:48.704 --> 29:50.455
Who asked questions before?

29:50.539 --> 29:53.666
How can someone so small
be such a huge pain in my arse?

29:53.750 --> 29:55.001
Who asked questions?

29:57.963 --> 29:59.380
The Hand of the King.

29:59.882 --> 30:01.674
Hands of the King.

30:02.342 --> 30:04.927
Lord Arryn came first
a few weeks before he died,

30:05.012 --> 30:08.556
and then Lord Stark came
a few weeks before he died.

30:09.475 --> 30:11.350
Lord Stark?

30:11.435 --> 30:14.896
See? Asking me questions is bad luck.

30:16.732 --> 30:18.733
You'll probably be dead soon.

30:19.693 --> 30:22.945
- What did they ask about?
- My mum.

30:23.030 --> 30:25.615
- Who's your mum?
- Just my mum,

30:25.699 --> 30:27.617
worked in a tavern, died when I was little.

30:27.701 --> 30:29.327
And who was your father?

30:29.411 --> 30:32.538
Could've been one of those
gold-hatted bastards, for all I know.

30:32.623 --> 30:34.707
What about you anyway?

30:34.791 --> 30:36.918
You thought they were after you.

30:37.920 --> 30:39.837
Why?

30:39.922 --> 30:42.757
Did you kill someone
or is it just because you're a girl?

30:43.217 --> 30:45.593
- I'm not a girl.
- Yes, you are.

30:45.802 --> 30:47.345
Do you think I'm as stupid
as the rest of them?

30:47.429 --> 30:48.471
Stupider.

30:48.555 --> 30:50.473
The Night's Watch doesn't take girls,
everyone knows that.

30:50.557 --> 30:53.017
- Yeah, that's true, but you're still a girl.
- I am not!

30:53.101 --> 30:55.686
Yeah? Well, pull your cock out
and take a piss, then.

30:56.772 --> 30:58.356
I don't need to take a piss.

31:04.780 --> 31:06.781
Lommy and Hot Pie can't know.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.282
No one can know.

31:08.367 --> 31:11.953
Well, they won't. Not from me.

31:14.915 --> 31:16.457
My name's not Arry.

31:17.459 --> 31:20.044
It's Arya, of House Stark.

31:22.172 --> 31:24.298
Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell.

31:25.592 --> 31:28.761
He was your father, the Hand, the traitor.

31:28.845 --> 31:30.346
He was never a traitor.

31:30.806 --> 31:32.348
Joffrey is a liar.

31:33.433 --> 31:35.226
So you're a highborn, then. You're a lady.

31:35.310 --> 31:37.186
No. I mean, yes.

31:37.271 --> 31:38.813
My mother was a lady and my sister...

31:38.897 --> 31:42.441
Yeah, but you were a lord's daughter,
and you lived in a castle and you...

31:42.651 --> 31:45.236
Look, all that about cocks,
I should never have said...

31:45.320 --> 31:47.863
And I've been pissing
in front of you and everything.

31:48.991 --> 31:50.366
I should be calling you "my lady."

31:50.450 --> 31:53.244
- Do not call me "my lady."
- As my lady commands.

31:53.328 --> 31:55.204
Well, that was unladylike.

31:55.289 --> 31:56.789
Oh!

32:24.526 --> 32:26.277
What's she carrying?

32:27.654 --> 32:29.238
Myrish oranges,

32:29.698 --> 32:30.990
wine from the Arbor...

32:32.326 --> 32:34.869
and the heir to Pyke and the Iron lslands.

32:38.373 --> 32:41.292
The only living son of Balon Greyjoy.

32:45.047 --> 32:46.047
Me.

32:47.924 --> 32:49.467
I don't like wine.

32:50.218 --> 32:51.510
Woman's drink.

32:55.057 --> 32:56.432
I need to get to Pyke.

33:06.401 --> 33:08.194
I'll find you a horse.

33:19.039 --> 33:22.291
I'm heading that way. I can take you there.

33:23.502 --> 33:24.752
I bet you can.

33:25.087 --> 33:26.921
Have you been at sea long?

33:27.172 --> 33:29.548
Or were there just no women
where you came from?

33:29.633 --> 33:31.801
- None like you.
- You don't know what I'm like.

33:32.552 --> 33:34.512
Maybe you don't know what you're like.

33:34.596 --> 33:36.722
Maybe you need someone to teach you.

33:38.183 --> 33:39.684
Do you know who I am?

33:39.768 --> 33:43.062
You think I offer free rides
to every man in jewelry,

33:44.189 --> 33:45.606
Lord Greyjoy?

33:48.402 --> 33:50.986
Have my things sent up to the castle.

34:08.170 --> 34:09.588
You should give me the reins.

34:09.672 --> 34:11.297
I'm a better rider than you.

34:11.800 --> 34:13.300
I've been on horseback
for the past nine years.

34:13.467 --> 34:14.885
Nine years?

34:15.011 --> 34:17.763
Do you still know your way around a ship?

34:17.848 --> 34:19.806
Have these hands ever touched a rope?

34:20.016 --> 34:22.309
Don't you worry about my hands.

34:24.062 --> 34:26.355
The sea is in my blood.

34:26.440 --> 34:29.442
Your blood will be in the sea
if I don't watch where I'm going.

34:29.525 --> 34:31.985
I have a proposal for my father,

34:32.821 --> 34:35.406
one that will make him king again,

34:35.489 --> 34:37.116
and me after him.

34:39.578 --> 34:42.329
You may get to stay
in a castle tonight if you're lucky.

34:42.831 --> 34:44.540
Is that an offer from my future king?

34:44.623 --> 34:46.751
An order from your future king.

34:49.337 --> 34:51.964
You can tell your grandchildren
about this night.

34:52.132 --> 34:55.426
I don't imagine it will be
a story fit for children.

35:08.315 --> 35:09.440
Father.

35:10.901 --> 35:12.526
Nine years, is it?

35:13.904 --> 35:15.780
They took a frightened boy.

35:16.490 --> 35:18.199
What have they given back?

35:20.035 --> 35:21.160
A man.

35:22.162 --> 35:24.371
- Your blood and your heir.
- We shall see.

35:26.500 --> 35:28.793
Stark had you longer than I did.

35:29.586 --> 35:31.587
Lord Stark is gone.

35:33.423 --> 35:35.883
And how do you feel about that?

35:39.805 --> 35:41.055
What's done is done.

35:42.390 --> 35:44.141
I've brought you a proposal from Robb Stark.

35:44.226 --> 35:45.726
Who gave you those clothes?

35:47.145 --> 35:50.731
Was it Ned Stark's pleasure
to make you his daughter?

35:51.566 --> 35:53.651
If my clothes offend you, I will change them.

35:53.735 --> 35:54.860
You will.

35:56.321 --> 35:58.697
That bauble round your neck,

35:58.782 --> 36:01.951
did you pay the iron price for it, or the gold?

36:03.245 --> 36:04.829
I asked a question.

36:04.913 --> 36:07.456
Did you pull it from the neck
of a corpse you made

36:07.541 --> 36:11.794
or did you buy it to match your fine clothes?

36:13.964 --> 36:16.423
Iron or gold?

36:19.553 --> 36:20.594
Gold.

36:25.517 --> 36:28.269
I'll not have my son dressed as a whore.

36:31.648 --> 36:33.732
My fears have come true,

36:33.817 --> 36:36.110
the Starks have made you theirs.

36:36.194 --> 36:39.238
- My blood is salt and iron.
- Yet the Stark boy sends you to me

36:39.322 --> 36:42.616
like a trained raven clutching his message.

36:42.742 --> 36:44.535
The offer he makes is one I proposed.

36:44.619 --> 36:47.246
- He heeds your counsel?
- I've lived with him,

36:47.372 --> 36:48.873
hunted with him, fought at his side.

36:48.957 --> 36:50.457
He thinks of me as a brother.

36:50.542 --> 36:53.294
No, not here, not in my hearing.

36:53.378 --> 36:55.671
You will not name him brother,

36:55.755 --> 36:59.717
this son of the man who put
your true brothers to the sword.

36:59.801 --> 37:02.595
Or have you forgotten your own blood?

37:02.679 --> 37:04.597
I forget nothing.

37:04.681 --> 37:06.515
I remember my brothers.

37:07.601 --> 37:10.019
And I remember when my father was a king.

37:26.828 --> 37:27.828
I see.

37:28.538 --> 37:31.248
I destroy Robb Stark's enemies for him

37:31.333 --> 37:34.627
and he will make me
king of the Iron lslands once again.

37:34.711 --> 37:37.379
- I will lead the attack myself.
- Oh, you will?

37:38.590 --> 37:41.175
I'm your son, your only living heir.

37:41.259 --> 37:43.177
Who else?

37:45.639 --> 37:47.556
I told you to wait outside.

37:49.059 --> 37:50.851
How did you get past the guards?

37:50.936 --> 37:53.312
Anything with a cock is easy to fool.

37:54.189 --> 37:55.522
My dear.

37:59.653 --> 38:00.736
Yara?

38:01.196 --> 38:03.197
So good to see you, brother.

38:04.115 --> 38:07.618
This is a homecoming
I'll tell my grandchildren about.

38:10.455 --> 38:12.748
- She can't lead an attack!
- And why not?

38:13.667 --> 38:14.792
You're a woman!

38:14.876 --> 38:18.295
- You're the one in skirts.
- This isn't Winterfell, boy.

38:18.463 --> 38:20.965
Your sister took over command
of your eldest brother's ship

38:21.049 --> 38:23.801
after your new father killed him.

38:23.885 --> 38:26.845
- What's dead may never die.
- ...dead may never die.

38:27.722 --> 38:31.558
The only nights she's spent off these islands
have been spent on the sea.

38:32.686 --> 38:34.603
She's commanded men.

38:34.688 --> 38:36.188
She's killed men.

38:36.898 --> 38:38.899
She knows who she is.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.988
No man gives me a crown.

38:44.656 --> 38:46.824
I pay the iron price.

38:47.325 --> 38:49.243
I will take my crown,

38:49.786 --> 38:51.954
for that is who I am.

38:52.747 --> 38:54.790
That is who we have always been.

38:59.713 --> 39:01.964
You won't stand a chance
against the Lannisters on your own.

39:02.090 --> 39:04.758
Who said anything about the Lannisters?

39:12.517 --> 39:15.352
You'll have your gold
when we take the treasury at King's Landing.

39:15.437 --> 39:17.271
All these kings fighting for the throne,

39:17.355 --> 39:20.190
and this Stannis has the smallest army.

39:20.275 --> 39:22.693
Why would I bet on the man
with the worst chance?

39:23.069 --> 39:24.737
Because you're a smart gambler.

39:25.572 --> 39:28.490
Stannis has proved himself in war twice.

39:28.575 --> 39:31.744
His baby brother has never set foot
on a battlefield.

39:31.828 --> 39:33.579
Neither has the false King Joffrey.

39:33.663 --> 39:35.622
And yet they both have larger armies.

39:35.707 --> 39:37.541
Stannis has just begun the fight.

39:37.625 --> 39:40.586
His bannermen will rally to his cause.

39:41.421 --> 39:45.591
There's no man in the Seven Kingdoms
more honorable than Stannis Baratheon

39:45.675 --> 39:47.092
or more worthy of loyalty.

39:47.177 --> 39:48.594
What is the world coming to

39:48.678 --> 39:51.221
when smugglers must vouch
for the honor of kings?

39:51.306 --> 39:53.640
- Mind your words, pirate.
- Matthos.

39:53.725 --> 39:55.434
You think I'm insulted?

39:55.518 --> 39:58.395
I am a pirate. I'm an excellent pirate.

39:58.772 --> 40:00.439
I don't sail for promises.

40:00.523 --> 40:01.982
Of course you do.

40:02.484 --> 40:05.069
Every time you leave harbor,
you're leaving on a promise,

40:05.153 --> 40:06.612
a promise that somewhere on the sea,

40:06.696 --> 40:09.031
somebody's got some gold
and you can take it from him.

40:09.115 --> 40:11.658
- That's a promise that always comes true.
- As is mine.

40:12.285 --> 40:14.119
You're not a young man, Salladhor.

40:14.204 --> 40:17.664
And correct me if I'm wrong,
most pirates don't grow old.

40:18.583 --> 40:19.875
Only the clever ones.

40:20.668 --> 40:22.753
You want to spend
your last few years on the sea

40:22.837 --> 40:26.590
stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers
and Myrenese silk merchants, then go.

40:26.674 --> 40:29.843
They're out there waiting for you. That's easy.

40:30.303 --> 40:32.137
What I'm offering you is hard.

40:34.349 --> 40:37.142
Come with me and plunder
the greatest city in Westeros.

40:38.353 --> 40:40.896
You'll be the richest man in Lys,
and the most famous.

40:40.980 --> 40:44.817
They'll be singing songs about you
as long as men have voices to sing.

40:46.569 --> 40:48.862
"Salladhor Saan" is a good name for songs.

40:48.947 --> 40:52.366
- It is.
- One thing, I want the queen.

40:52.492 --> 40:55.327
- The queen?
- Cersei, I want her.

40:55.411 --> 40:57.913
I'll sail with your fleet, all 30 of my ships.

40:57.997 --> 41:00.165
And if we don't drown at the bottom
of Blackwater Bay,

41:00.250 --> 41:03.460
I will fuck this blonde queen
and I'll fuck her well.

41:03.545 --> 41:05.379
This war isn't about you.

41:06.381 --> 41:09.133
We're not attacking King's Landing
so that you can rape the queen.

41:09.217 --> 41:11.718
I'm not going to rape her.
I'm going to fuck her.

41:12.220 --> 41:13.512
As if she would just let you.

41:13.596 --> 41:15.430
You don't know how persuasive I am.

41:16.182 --> 41:17.891
I've never tried to fuck you.

41:20.061 --> 41:22.855
Stannis is the rightful king
and the Lord of Light,

41:22.939 --> 41:24.398
the one true god...

41:24.524 --> 41:25.983
I've been all over the world, my boy,

41:26.067 --> 41:29.027
and everywhere I go,
people tell me about the true gods.

41:29.112 --> 41:30.863
They all think they found the right one.

41:31.406 --> 41:34.116
The one true god
is what's between a woman's legs,

41:34.242 --> 41:36.743
and better yet, a queen's legs.

41:38.121 --> 41:40.497
I never thought you'd have
a true believer for a son.

41:40.582 --> 41:41.874
He's young yet.

41:43.293 --> 41:46.128
I promise you the gold.
I promise you the glory.

41:46.212 --> 41:47.713
I cannot promise you the queen.

41:51.676 --> 41:53.093
You believe your king can win?

41:53.761 --> 41:55.429
He is the one true king.

41:55.847 --> 41:57.306
You Westerosi are funny people.

41:57.724 --> 42:00.601
A man chops off your fingers
and you fall in love with him.

42:02.896 --> 42:05.063
I'll sail with you, Davos Seaworth.

42:05.148 --> 42:07.900
You're the most honest smuggler I ever met.

42:08.735 --> 42:11.028
Make me rich.

42:11.112 --> 42:14.239
Get me to the gates
of King's Landing and I will.

42:26.252 --> 42:27.920
When will the king have us sail?

42:28.004 --> 42:30.047
As soon as his god wills it.

42:30.131 --> 42:32.758
He's my god, too, and yours,

42:32.842 --> 42:35.260
but you are too blind to see.

42:37.513 --> 42:39.640
- Let me teach you how to read.
- Oh, you and your mother.

42:39.724 --> 42:41.266
It won't take long.
You already know the letters.

42:41.351 --> 42:43.560
The holy books are
much more persuasive than I can be.

42:43.645 --> 42:45.395
I wish I had a god, truly.

42:45.480 --> 42:48.232
I'm not mocking you,
but I've seen men pray to every god there is,

42:48.316 --> 42:50.567
pray for wind, pray for rain, pray for home.

42:50.652 --> 42:53.362
- None of it works.
- But you always came home.

42:53.446 --> 42:54.988
I wasn't praying.

42:55.949 --> 42:57.741
But I was.

42:58.826 --> 43:00.410
Every night that you were at sea,

43:00.495 --> 43:03.330
I lit a candle and I prayed for you.

43:04.832 --> 43:06.291
You want me to have a god?

43:06.376 --> 43:09.461
Fine. King Stannis is my god.

43:09.545 --> 43:11.964
He raised me up
and blessed me with his trust.

43:12.048 --> 43:14.716
He gave you a future
I could never have imagined.

43:14.801 --> 43:16.677
You know how to read.
You'll be a knight someday.

43:16.761 --> 43:19.972
You think a fire god commanded all that?

43:20.056 --> 43:23.350
It was Stannis, only Stannis.

43:23.851 --> 43:26.395
Stannis is my king, but he's only a man.

43:26.479 --> 43:29.231
Don't tell him that.

43:31.109 --> 43:33.235
CERSEl: Lord Janos Slynt
was commander of the City Watch.

43:33.319 --> 43:34.736
You had no right to exile him.

43:34.821 --> 43:36.363
I have every right. I am the King's Hand.

43:36.447 --> 43:39.157
You're serving as the King's Hand
till Father gets here.

43:39.242 --> 43:40.575
I am Queen Regent.

43:40.660 --> 43:42.286
Listen to me, Queen Regent.

43:42.370 --> 43:43.829
You're losing the people.

43:44.706 --> 43:46.832
- Do you hear me?
- The people.

43:47.208 --> 43:48.625
You think I care?

43:48.710 --> 43:52.546
You might find it difficult
to rule over millions who want you dead.

43:53.339 --> 43:57.467
Half the city will starve when winter comes.
The other half will plot to overthrow you.

43:57.552 --> 44:01.138
And your gold-plated thugs
just gave them their rallying cry,

44:01.723 --> 44:03.974
"The Queen slaughters babies."

44:06.644 --> 44:09.187
You don't even have the decency to deny it.

44:19.741 --> 44:21.908
It wasn't you who gave the order, was it?

44:22.869 --> 44:24.578
Joffrey didn't even tell you.

44:27.457 --> 44:28.999
Did he tell you?

44:29.083 --> 44:30.917
I imagine that would be even worse.

44:31.210 --> 44:33.378
He did what needed to be done.

44:33.463 --> 44:36.506
You want to be Hand of the King?
You want to rule?

44:36.591 --> 44:39.968
This is what ruling is,
lying on a bed of weeds,

44:40.053 --> 44:41.845
ripping them out by the root, one by one,

44:41.929 --> 44:43.638
before they strangle you in your sleep.

44:43.723 --> 44:46.141
I'm no king,
but I think there's more to ruling than that.

44:46.225 --> 44:47.768
I don't care what you think!

44:48.269 --> 44:49.603
You've never taken it seriously.

44:49.687 --> 44:51.396
You haven't, Jaime hasn't.

44:55.568 --> 44:57.069
It's all fallen on me.

45:01.741 --> 45:05.160
As has Jaime, repeatedly,
according to Stannis Baratheon.

45:10.666 --> 45:12.125
You're funny.

45:15.963 --> 45:18.048
You've always been funny...

45:19.050 --> 45:22.344
but none of yourjokes will ever match
the first one, will they?

45:24.138 --> 45:25.806
You remember?

45:26.849 --> 45:29.226
Back when you ripped my mother open
on your way out of her

45:29.310 --> 45:31.186
and she bled to death?

45:33.189 --> 45:35.273
She was my mother, too.

45:35.483 --> 45:36.942
Mother gone...

45:39.362 --> 45:40.987
for the sake of you.

45:43.950 --> 45:46.743
There's no biggerjoke in the world than that.

46:09.016 --> 46:11.935
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

46:12.019 --> 46:14.062
How did you fare with your pirate?

46:14.147 --> 46:17.566
Salladhor Saan will join our fleet, 30 ships.

46:17.650 --> 46:19.568
His men know how to fight.

46:19.652 --> 46:23.113
In my experience,
pirates prefer fighting unarmed men.

46:23.197 --> 46:24.614
It does seem the wiser choice.

46:24.699 --> 46:27.033
There won't be a choice this time.

46:28.327 --> 46:29.411
Do you trust him?

46:30.079 --> 46:33.665
Salladhor Saan is an old friend.
I've known him 30 years.

46:33.749 --> 46:35.667
I've never trusted him.

46:36.252 --> 46:39.546
Now, once he gets the smell of gold
he never stops.

46:40.339 --> 46:43.216
Well, if he does his job, he'll have his share.

46:46.971 --> 46:48.013
Leave us.

46:54.729 --> 46:55.729
At once, Your Grace.

47:03.029 --> 47:06.072
The Lord of Light shines through you,
young warrior.

47:11.871 --> 47:12.954
Come.

47:20.546 --> 47:21.796
What did you say to him?

47:21.881 --> 47:24.799
I told him death by fire is the purest death.

47:25.801 --> 47:27.802
- Why?
- Because it is true.

47:29.847 --> 47:31.264
You're troubled, my king.

47:32.183 --> 47:33.433
Yeah.

47:33.601 --> 47:36.102
These armies are toys for the Lord of Light.

47:36.312 --> 47:39.189
Tell your lord to burn them, then.

47:39.273 --> 47:40.690
I tell him nothing.

47:40.775 --> 47:43.777
I pray for his commands and I obey.

47:45.821 --> 47:49.616
My little brother has 100,000 men,
according to the scouts,

47:49.700 --> 47:52.536
men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me.

47:52.620 --> 47:54.454
You must have faith.

47:54.789 --> 47:55.956
Faith?

47:57.625 --> 48:00.252
In a real war, the side with
the greater number wins,

48:00.336 --> 48:01.962
nine times out of ten.

48:02.463 --> 48:03.880
Then we must be the 10th.

48:04.340 --> 48:07.092
I cannot defeat my brother in the field.

48:08.427 --> 48:11.805
And I can't take King's Landing
without the men he's stolen.

48:13.349 --> 48:16.977
I have seen the path to victory in the flames.

48:18.688 --> 48:21.856
But first, you must give yourself
to the Lord of Light.

48:21.941 --> 48:24.651
I've said the words, damn you.

48:28.406 --> 48:30.574
I burned the idols.

48:33.953 --> 48:37.372
You must give all of yourself.

48:42.670 --> 48:43.753
I have a wife.

48:46.048 --> 48:47.299
I took a vow.

48:49.135 --> 48:52.512
She's sickly, weak...

48:54.640 --> 48:56.433
Shut away in a tower.

48:57.768 --> 48:59.769
She disgusts you.

49:03.190 --> 49:05.984
And she's given you nothing,

49:06.193 --> 49:09.779
no sons, only stillborns,

49:11.032 --> 49:12.574
only death.

49:18.998 --> 49:23.043
I will give you a son, my king.

49:26.047 --> 49:27.088
A son?
