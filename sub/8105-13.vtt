WEBVTT

00:32.241 --> 00:33.825
Give me my next change.

00:38.539 --> 00:39.914
I think I'm gonna puke.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.375
- Not on this dress.
- I'm serious.

00:42.543 --> 00:46.170
Kate Moss was doing this at 13.
You have two years on her.

00:47.297 --> 00:49.882
Yeah, that's what I like to see.
You got this.

00:50.008 --> 00:52.385
The next show, you're bride.

00:54.805 --> 00:56.431
Did Austin just offer you bride?

00:56.557 --> 00:59.559
It wasn't a real offer, Dad.
He was just being nice.

00:59.685 --> 01:02.019
These shoes are gonna be impossible
to walk in.

01:02.146 --> 01:03.604
You've done this 100 times before.

01:03.731 --> 01:05.565
The runway's
just a little bit longer here.

01:05.691 --> 01:07.525
One of the girls said
Madonna's in the front row.

01:07.651 --> 01:11.237
Sweetie, hey, come on.
Are you gonna be able to do this?

01:14.950 --> 01:16.117
All right, come here.

01:19.246 --> 01:20.621
Here, hold this.

01:21.915 --> 01:24.292
The doctor gave me these
for anxiety, all right?

01:24.418 --> 01:27.962
It'll calm you down.
Here. Come on, it's okay.

01:31.300 --> 01:32.341
Where's Alex?

01:34.219 --> 01:35.678
Alex, you're up!

01:36.722 --> 01:38.890
Go! Go! Go! Go! Knock them out!

02:17.930 --> 02:19.222
Are you okay?

02:27.981 --> 02:29.065
Alex!

04:33.523 --> 04:34.690
How'd you get here?

04:36.109 --> 04:39.028
- By osmosis.
- No helmet?

04:39.154 --> 04:40.905
Didn't seem like riding weather.

04:41.031 --> 04:43.950
The fact that you can barely stand
upright had nothing to do with it?

04:44.076 --> 04:45.242
Infarctions hurt. House.

04:45.369 --> 04:46.661
It's what they do.

04:47.579 --> 04:49.997
Worsening pain could actually be
a good thing.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.958
It means the nerves
might be regenerating.

04:52.084 --> 04:54.585
It could be good, it could be bad.
Thanks for the differential.

04:54.711 --> 04:56.087
Any other options?

04:56.213 --> 04:59.882
Have you ever considered
a career as a motivational speaker?

05:00.008 --> 05:02.259
- Why don't you check out some rehab?
- I did the rehab thing.

05:02.386 --> 05:04.470
One session, and you
didn't even finish that session.

05:04.596 --> 05:06.931
The guy wanted me
to "visualize the healing".

05:07.057 --> 05:09.934
- I could do that at home.
- At least let me get you an MRI.

05:10.060 --> 05:13.104
It's a very simple equation:
more pain, more pills.

05:13.230 --> 05:14.647
Teenage supermodel.

05:15.148 --> 05:19.902
Presented with double vision,
sudden aggressive behavior, cataplexy.

05:20.028 --> 05:21.862
You had me at "teenage supermodel".

05:25.075 --> 05:26.367
You okay? Mmm-hmm.

05:32.749 --> 05:33.874
Wow.

05:34.376 --> 05:35.793
You should be a model.

05:36.670 --> 05:39.088
- Are you really 15?
- Who are you?

05:39.214 --> 05:43.050
I'll be the one saving her life today,
assuming she's dying.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.052
- Who are you?
- He's my father.

05:46.096 --> 05:47.430
Any idea what's wrong with her?

05:47.556 --> 05:50.182
Well, from the looks of it,
not a single thing.

05:52.227 --> 05:54.937
I probably should stop staring
and check out the file.

05:55.272 --> 05:58.566
So what set off the brawl?
She stand in your light?

05:58.692 --> 06:01.569
I didn't even know her.
I didn't know what happened.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.155
Look, I know some models
are notorious for hissy fits,

06:04.281 --> 06:06.157
but Alex... I've never
even seen her get angry.

06:06.283 --> 06:07.575
Even when she was a kid...

06:07.701 --> 06:09.618
I'm sure she was delightful
in her youth.

06:09.745 --> 06:10.870
Then you passed out.

06:10.996 --> 06:13.456
I was passed out, but I wasn't.

06:13.582 --> 06:16.876
I knew what was going on,
but I couldn't move or talk.

06:17.294 --> 06:20.254
Yeah, it sounds like a medical thing.
It's called "cataplexy".

06:20.714 --> 06:23.549
Catfight and cataplexy on the catwalk.

06:23.967 --> 06:26.218
Cool. How much were you drinking?

06:26.553 --> 06:28.637
She only had one sip of champagne.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.433
Forget it.
I'll find out from the tox screen.

06:32.559 --> 06:35.019
All right, look, I gave her a Valium.

06:35.145 --> 06:37.146
- Do you think that's what did this?
- No.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.023
How long have you had the sweats?

06:40.317 --> 06:42.777
- A couple of days.
- Any other complaints?

06:43.320 --> 06:47.323
My stomach's been bothering me
and I've been feeling a little nauseous.

06:47.449 --> 06:48.991
Okay, here's how this works.

06:49.117 --> 06:51.494
My lackeys will be by shortly
to draw some blood,

06:51.620 --> 06:53.996
collect some urine,
any other fluids you got.

06:54.122 --> 06:58.125
I'll do some other doctorly stuff,
and we'll be in touch.

07:04.549 --> 07:07.009
Since when do you voluntarily
go see patients?

07:07.135 --> 07:09.637
- Have you seen her?
- She's 15.

07:09.805 --> 07:12.515
There's something about her,
something in her eyes,

07:12.641 --> 07:14.767
- kind of a maturity.
- Yeah, yeah, she's an old soul.

07:14.893 --> 07:16.727
This is creepy, even for you.

07:16.853 --> 07:19.355
She's a fashion model,
on the cover of magazines.

07:19.523 --> 07:21.190
We hold her up as the sexual ideal.

07:21.316 --> 07:23.359
The law says
we can't touch her for three more years.

07:23.485 --> 07:24.902
How hypocritical is that?

07:25.028 --> 07:28.781
Did the history reveal anything,
oh, I don't know, medically relevant?

07:28.907 --> 07:31.992
History, right.
I knew I was forgetting something.

07:32.119 --> 07:35.496
You should do one of those while you're
running the labs and the tox screen.

07:40.919 --> 07:43.420
The labs show Valium
and heroin in her urine.

07:43.547 --> 07:46.465
A supermodel on smack. Shocker.

07:46.758 --> 07:50.136
Oh, Alex, I expected
so much more from you.

07:50.262 --> 07:53.097
Heroin chic is so five years ago.

07:53.223 --> 07:56.475
Okay, let's start crossing out
withdrawal symptoms.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.227
A positive test means she tried it once.

07:58.353 --> 08:00.604
It doesn't mean she's an addict.
She's only 15.

08:00.730 --> 08:02.648
- There's no age limit on addiction.
- He's right.

08:02.774 --> 08:05.526
She's never menstruated. Sounds like
a symptom of drug addiction to me.

08:05.652 --> 08:09.446
Or bulimia. Or her age. Some girls don't
start till their mid-to-late teens.

08:09.573 --> 08:12.741
Evidence to the contrary,
the rounded hips.

08:13.368 --> 08:16.036
The perfectly-sculpted,
bountiful breasts.

08:16.788 --> 08:19.915
Implants.
I've seen some of her photos.

08:20.041 --> 08:21.959
They've grown dramatically
since last summer.

08:22.085 --> 08:24.170
Symptomatic of turning 14.

08:24.296 --> 08:28.174
Two clinic hours says that those
"love apples" are handcrafted by God.

08:29.551 --> 08:32.052
- I thought you didn't believe in God.
- I do now.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.220
You're on.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.890
Could we talk about her health
instead of her breasts?

08:36.016 --> 08:37.224
It could be relevant.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.560
Come on, Cameron,
there's nothing to be ashamed of.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.103
Many women develop breasts.

08:47.777 --> 08:49.153
No, I'm fine.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.490
Even if she is an addict,
a lot of her symptoms,

08:53.617 --> 08:56.035
the cataplexy, the violence,
it could be neurological.

08:56.161 --> 08:57.745
If we chalk this up to drugs,
we could be

08:57.871 --> 09:00.039
releasing her with juvenile MS
or Parkinson's...

09:00.165 --> 09:01.999
- Detox her.
- Fine.

09:02.125 --> 09:04.835
We'll set her up on a program,
they'll wean her onto the methadone.

09:04.961 --> 09:07.296
And in four weeks,
we'll know you're right.

09:07.422 --> 09:08.797
Or, we'll know that Cameron's right

09:08.924 --> 09:12.092
and the pretty girl
will do Milan next fall in a wheelchair.

09:12.219 --> 09:15.054
Put her in a coma,
pump her full of naltrexone.

09:15.180 --> 09:16.931
Cut the four weeks to one night.

09:19.601 --> 09:23.145
The lab reports show that your daughter
had heroin in her system.

09:23.855 --> 09:25.397
Were you aware of her drug use?

09:26.316 --> 09:27.316
No.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.819
We think she's suffering
from withdrawal symptoms.

09:30.946 --> 09:33.614
Detoxing generally takes several weeks.

09:33.740 --> 09:36.575
The danger is that if the drugs
are masking some other illness,

09:36.701 --> 09:39.495
it could worsen
before we've weaned her off the heroin.

09:39.621 --> 09:40.871
Well, how much worse?

09:40.997 --> 09:43.457
We don't know because
we don't know what's wrong.

09:44.501 --> 09:46.460
There is a rapid detox procedure.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.338
We flush her system
with an opioid antagonist.

09:49.464 --> 09:51.423
It'll end her addiction overnight.

09:52.926 --> 09:56.095
The process is dangerous
because we have to induce a coma.

09:56.846 --> 10:00.307
It also means that if she ever relapses,
there's a good chance she'll overdose

10:00.433 --> 10:02.643
because her body
won't react to the drug.

10:03.520 --> 10:06.981
So either way I'm risking her life.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.238
Do you have to tell her
how dangerous it is?

10:21.997 --> 10:23.497
Is it dangerous?

10:23.748 --> 10:27.584
There are certain risks.
We've gone over them with your father.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.629
And he's not worried?

10:31.298 --> 10:34.591
He's your dad. He's always gonna worry.

10:35.677 --> 10:37.845
But he knows
we're gonna take good care of you.

10:38.471 --> 10:41.181
Everything's starting to hurt.
My legs are...

10:41.308 --> 10:44.018
Heroin withdrawal
is an extremely painful process.

10:44.144 --> 10:47.062
But we're gonna put you to sleep.
You won't feel a thing.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.650
- You promise?
- I promise.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.738
That was a pretty stupid thing
to do, huh?

10:55.864 --> 10:57.406
Getting hooked on drugs?

10:57.532 --> 10:59.658
Yeah, not the best move
you've ever made.

10:59.784 --> 11:02.119
Just, I thought it would be fun.

11:02.245 --> 11:04.496
You don't have to explain to us.

11:04.622 --> 11:07.124
A lot of,
a lot of the other girls were...

11:08.126 --> 11:10.210
When you wake up,
you'll feel a lot better.

11:45.246 --> 11:47.122
Nurse! Nurse!

12:05.100 --> 12:07.684
You son of a bitch! You killed her!

12:08.812 --> 12:10.938
- She's not dead.
- She had a heart attack.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.648
She's stable now. The anesthesia...

12:12.774 --> 12:14.233
Get her out of that coma.

12:14.359 --> 12:16.735
- I don't think so.
- Stop this!

12:17.278 --> 12:19.905
All right, I don't consent anymore.

12:20.657 --> 12:22.616
I want her to do the slow detox.

12:25.453 --> 12:29.289
Did you ever get a paper cut?
A really nasty one, between the fingers?

12:30.250 --> 12:31.834
Multiply that by about a billion

12:31.960 --> 12:35.003
and you'll just barely approach
the kind of suffering she'll experience

12:35.130 --> 12:36.672
if we wake her up now.

12:37.632 --> 12:39.299
We're committed to this.

12:42.512 --> 12:45.055
She's out till morning. Go get a book.

12:54.524 --> 12:57.943
I haven't slept in weeks,
because my teeth hurt.

12:59.279 --> 13:02.906
The dentist couldn't find any cavities.
And I'm getting these headaches.

13:03.032 --> 13:05.993
Oh! Poor you.

13:09.330 --> 13:10.789
I think I'm going crazy.

13:11.332 --> 13:14.835
And my stomach,
I roll out of bed and I wanna puke.

13:15.253 --> 13:16.837
I take it you're married?

13:18.423 --> 13:21.633
- You must be psychic.
- You must be witty.

13:21.759 --> 13:24.136
- When's she due?
- How'd you know she was...

13:24.262 --> 13:28.390
Because I'm doing her.
You've got Couvade Syndrome.

13:29.434 --> 13:32.311
It's just a fancy way
of saying you should stop whining.

13:32.437 --> 13:35.189
Millions of women have got
the same thing. They're not bugging me.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.441
You're suffering
from sympathetic pregnancy.

13:38.693 --> 13:41.028
Gotta go. People dying.

13:41.279 --> 13:44.740
- Whole circle-of-life thing.
- It's all in my head?

13:44.949 --> 13:47.201
No, it's all in your hormones.

13:47.327 --> 13:50.662
The good news is, no one's gonna
lecture you if you smoke and get drunk.

13:56.711 --> 13:58.128
Shouldn't she be awake by now?

13:58.254 --> 14:00.797
It's only been a half an hour
since we stopped the medicine.

14:00.924 --> 14:02.799
Well, you said
that's how long it would take.

14:02.926 --> 14:04.885
I said it would take
about a half an hour.

14:05.011 --> 14:07.721
- couldn't this mean something more...
- So far, it means nothing.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.932
She had a heart attack.
She could have brain damage.

14:10.058 --> 14:12.643
- She could have something more...
- She's opening her eyes.

14:13.394 --> 14:15.896
Alex, you okay?

14:17.524 --> 14:19.024
Can you hear me?

14:23.696 --> 14:25.656
I got the cute doctor.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.535
Do you feel any pain?

14:30.245 --> 14:32.704
Good. Let us know if anything changes.

14:32.872 --> 14:35.249
If your stomach
doesn't feel right, anything.

14:36.626 --> 14:37.626
Hey.

14:39.754 --> 14:41.588
Are you mad at me, Daddy?

14:44.467 --> 14:45.717
I let you down.

14:45.843 --> 14:48.095
No, no. Not at all, sweetie, I...

14:48.221 --> 14:50.889
I should have been more mature.
I should have handled the pressure.

14:51.015 --> 14:52.224
Stop, stop.

14:53.226 --> 14:56.770
We're gonna get you better, all right?
Nothing else matters.

14:58.856 --> 15:00.148
Excuse me.

15:03.361 --> 15:06.238
I've got you
on what we call a "banana bag".

15:06.489 --> 15:07.990
Plenty of vitamins, nutrients...

15:08.116 --> 15:09.908
I got the cute doctor.

15:14.998 --> 15:16.665
Are you mad at me, Daddy?

15:18.501 --> 15:21.044
- I let you down.
- What's going on?

15:22.255 --> 15:24.923
I should have been more mature.
I should have handled the pressure.

15:25.049 --> 15:26.341
What's wrong with her?

15:28.219 --> 15:31.221
Anterograde amnesia,
short-term memory loss.

15:31.347 --> 15:33.849
Evidence of a hypoxic brain injury.

15:33.975 --> 15:37.644
It might be the result of getting cut
off from the oxygen when she flatlined.

15:38.229 --> 15:41.940
Probably the result of that
rapid detox you told us to push on her.

15:43.109 --> 15:44.484
You gonna put that down?

15:51.034 --> 15:52.284
Are you gonna sulk?

15:54.537 --> 15:55.912
I'm not gonna indulge you.

15:56.039 --> 15:58.624
he treatment for hypoxic brain injuries
consists of...

15:59.626 --> 16:02.544
Cameron, Chase and the Dark One.

16:03.046 --> 16:04.338
Foreman, right?

16:04.922 --> 16:07.215
The patient flatlined
for, like, 30 seconds.

16:07.342 --> 16:08.717
You've got to be oxygen-deprived

16:08.843 --> 16:10.636
for longer than that
to lose brain function.

16:10.762 --> 16:13.639
- We can't be sure how long she was...
- Her brain's fine.

16:13.765 --> 16:16.433
Memory loss. You're saying
that's not a neurological symptom?

16:16.559 --> 16:19.394
No, I'm saying what I'm saying.
Her brain's fine.

16:20.313 --> 16:21.605
She's faking?

16:21.731 --> 16:23.899
She's got posttraumatic stress disorder.

16:24.108 --> 16:26.443
We got models fighting in Iraq now?

16:26.569 --> 16:28.654
Show me a woman on heroin
who looks like that,

16:28.780 --> 16:31.073
and I'll show you a woman
who's been sexually abused.

16:31.199 --> 16:33.867
That's your proof?
That she's good looking.

16:33.993 --> 16:38.789
He manages her career, travels
the world with her, at her side 24/7.

16:38.915 --> 16:42.125
He's either a very good dad
or a very bad dad.

16:42.877 --> 16:44.252
You saw that tokus.

16:44.796 --> 16:47.005
Would the fact that
she's your daughter really stop you?

16:48.633 --> 16:52.010
Her brain is running away from reality
and when the drugs can't do it anymore,

16:52.136 --> 16:53.720
it starts to shut down.

16:54.013 --> 16:57.307
Your theory has the advantages
of being completely unprovable

16:57.433 --> 16:59.685
and completely exculpating you.

17:00.353 --> 17:03.105
When you guys are done talking,
do an MRI and an LP.

17:03.231 --> 17:04.606
When her brain checks out as normal,

17:04.732 --> 17:07.567
then we'll know that Daddy
really, really loves her.

17:13.157 --> 17:14.241
Where's House?

17:14.742 --> 17:17.244
- He was in too much pain to work.
- Who's covering?

17:17.370 --> 17:19.663
He called 15 minutes
after his shift started.

17:19.789 --> 17:22.457
It was too late to find anybody.
Exam Room One.

17:29.090 --> 17:30.632
- Hi. Where's
- Dr. House?

17:30.758 --> 17:33.468
I wish I knew. What's the problem?

17:34.846 --> 17:36.179
It's personal.

17:37.682 --> 17:40.976
And it's so personal he didn't bother
writing anything in your chart.

17:41.102 --> 17:42.853
- It's getting worse.
- What is?

17:43.855 --> 17:45.021
It's personal.

17:46.482 --> 17:49.067
- Fine. You can wait.
- Doctor!

17:58.619 --> 18:00.078
I tell you what.

18:00.288 --> 18:04.416
I am going to give you
Dr. House's personal pager number.

18:09.589 --> 18:12.424
Why would your mind
go to abuse so fast?

18:12.717 --> 18:15.469
- Because I had a funny uncle.
- You were abused?

18:15.595 --> 18:19.014
What? No. Why'd your mind
go to that so fast?

18:19.140 --> 18:22.142
I just had a funny uncle.
Great stories, always filthy.

18:22.268 --> 18:24.603
I don't know
if it's something with this case

18:24.729 --> 18:27.814
or you got something personal
going on, the whole breakup thing?

18:27.940 --> 18:29.441
- It's personal.
- House.

18:30.151 --> 18:32.986
Your pain is affecting
your decision-making.

18:33.446 --> 18:36.323
You got a problem
with a call I make, question the call.

18:36.449 --> 18:37.741
Don't make it personal.

18:37.867 --> 18:40.243
Are you saying pain
can't affect your mood?

18:41.496 --> 18:44.247
If I'm right about the pain,
you're gonna wanna rush everything,

18:44.373 --> 18:46.458
which is what you're doing.

18:46.584 --> 18:47.709
Don't.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.173
Thank you.

18:58.930 --> 19:02.516
- Are you doing your daughter?
- What?

19:06.437 --> 19:09.564
We should probably talk privately, huh?
Come on, walk with me.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.071
- Come on.
- He's not!

19:16.197 --> 19:19.199
I'm sure he's not.
She is a babe, though.

19:35.508 --> 19:38.343
- We're gonna need you to keep still.
- I am.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.265
What do you think that means?

19:43.391 --> 19:45.976
It's either neurological
or psychological.

19:46.102 --> 19:48.812
The only thing we know for sure is
it's gonna screw up the MRI results,

19:48.938 --> 19:50.939
which is gonna make House
think he's right.

19:51.065 --> 19:52.315
This is a waste of time.

19:52.441 --> 19:53.775
Let's just get the LP.

19:57.488 --> 19:59.155
I should take your head off.

20:02.118 --> 20:04.870
Your glands are fine.
See, now, you're my patient.

20:04.996 --> 20:08.206
You got doctor-patient confidentiality.
No worries.

20:08.916 --> 20:11.251
- So, what did you do to her?
- Why would you possibly think...

20:11.377 --> 20:13.503
Hard to imagine anyone
not wanting to nail her.

20:13.629 --> 20:15.964
- You son of...
- It's a compliment.

20:16.966 --> 20:20.343
That heart-shaped ass, those perfect,
perky, all-natural breasts.

20:20.469 --> 20:22.470
That is my daughter
you're talking about!

20:22.597 --> 20:25.599
No, that's your daughter
you were talking about.

20:25.808 --> 20:28.518
"She just instinctively knows
how to walk."

20:28.644 --> 20:32.147
"Designers just love that heart-shaped
ass, those perfect, perky..."

20:32.273 --> 20:34.232
I'm her manager. I have to promote her.

20:34.358 --> 20:36.276
Oh, that makes sense.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.320
So you compartmentalize.

20:38.446 --> 20:40.864
When you're dealing with the press,
you're her manager.

20:40.990 --> 20:43.366
When you're helping with homework,
you're her dad.

20:43.492 --> 20:46.661
When you're making sweet, sweet love,
you're her manager.

20:46.787 --> 20:48.830
- All right.
- Do you love her?

20:48.956 --> 20:50.790
- I have never touched her.
- Do you love her?

20:50.917 --> 20:53.293
What are you doing?
Are you trying to trap me into saying...

20:53.419 --> 20:56.713
Do you love her enough
to admit that you slept with her?

21:00.301 --> 21:04.012
Psychological conditions can manifest
themselves in physical problems.

21:04.138 --> 21:06.765
Sometimes these can be
extreme enough to kill.

21:07.016 --> 21:09.684
There are treatments,
but only if there is a diagnosis.

21:11.187 --> 21:13.396
Are you going to admit
that you slept with your daughter

21:13.522 --> 21:15.315
or are you just gonna let her die?

21:23.282 --> 21:24.574
One time.

21:40.508 --> 21:41.633
PTSD.

21:42.635 --> 21:45.887
Get her a psyche referral,
pack her bags. He did her.

21:46.472 --> 21:48.932
- Don't think so.
- Daddy thinks so.

21:49.976 --> 21:51.810
He could be mistaken.
He said he was drunk.

21:51.936 --> 21:53.478
Maybe it was some other daughter.

21:53.896 --> 21:56.106
Elevated proteins in her CSF.

21:57.650 --> 22:02.070
You're wrong about PTSD and I was
wrong
about the hypoxic brain injury.

22:02.613 --> 22:05.740
Daddy didn't do this to her.
And neither did we.

22:17.211 --> 22:19.379
We have to call
Child Protective Services.

22:19.505 --> 22:21.172
Doctor-patient confidentiality.

22:21.298 --> 22:23.717
Doesn't apply in abuse cases.
You know that.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.885
We're mandated to report sexual abuse.

22:26.012 --> 22:28.596
Is it okay if I save her life first
or do you want to make sure

22:28.723 --> 22:31.307
that Daddy doesn't get visitation rights
to the gravesite?

22:31.684 --> 22:35.353
Okay, elevated proteins in her CSF
could mean dozens of different things.

22:35.479 --> 22:38.648
- Viral encephalitis, CNSV.
- Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?

22:38.774 --> 22:42.027
So we're just gonna leave a child
molester in the same room as his victim?

22:42.153 --> 22:43.611
It's got windows.

22:46.741 --> 22:49.451
Fine. Arrest him. Use Cuddy's handcuffs.

22:49.577 --> 22:52.412
If you're too distracted to deal with
this because your leg hurts, then...

22:52.538 --> 22:53.913
Yeah, I'm distracted!

22:54.040 --> 22:57.042
I'm all hung up on this 15-year-old
patient who's cataplectic,

22:57.168 --> 22:58.626
can't remember what she had for lunch

22:58.753 --> 23:00.462
and is rapidly losing control
of her body!

23:00.588 --> 23:02.922
And I want her father here
in case he's got any more secrets

23:03.049 --> 23:04.049
that I need to know about.

23:04.175 --> 23:06.718
Now, if you're not too distracted,
go take out a piece of her brain,

23:06.844 --> 23:08.428
stick it under a microscope.

23:09.930 --> 23:12.265
- Wilson!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:12.391 --> 23:14.976
Do you really think we need
to jump straight to brain biopsy?

23:15.102 --> 23:16.603
Nope. Let's continue playing

23:16.729 --> 23:19.564
"Pin the diagnosis on the supermodel"
until she's dead.

23:24.070 --> 23:26.780
- I heard you killed your supermodel.
- Only for a minute.

23:27.573 --> 23:30.575
Just for my own clarity, how many more
patients do you have to kill

23:30.701 --> 23:33.620
before you admit this leg thing
just might be a problem?

23:33.746 --> 23:34.829
Three.

23:37.291 --> 23:38.583
I need your help.

23:43.172 --> 23:46.174
We're gonna do something
called a burr-hole biopsy.

23:46.884 --> 23:49.511
We drill a small opening
in the back of your skull.

23:49.887 --> 23:52.806
Doctor, maybe you and I
should talk about this first.

23:52.932 --> 23:53.973
No.

23:54.100 --> 23:57.727
I just think Alex doesn't need
to be overwhelmed right now.

23:58.145 --> 24:00.772
I think she should have a say
in what happens to her body.

24:10.324 --> 24:12.909
Now, we're gonna remove
a small piece of brain tissue.

24:13.119 --> 24:15.745
Do you have to shave my hair?

24:16.580 --> 24:17.747
Hair grows back.

24:18.290 --> 24:20.291
I guess I won't remember anyways.

24:20.417 --> 24:23.086
There's a good chance
the amnesia is only temporary.

24:27.258 --> 24:28.424
Okay.

25:02.459 --> 25:04.919
Find a way to kick up the contribution.

25:07.548 --> 25:09.382
What did House do now?

25:17.057 --> 25:19.142
House, this is God.

25:20.311 --> 25:22.437
Look, I'm a little busy right now.

25:22.938 --> 25:25.231
I'm not supposed
to talk during these things.

25:25.357 --> 25:26.941
Got time Thursday?

25:27.067 --> 25:29.777
Let me check. Oh, I've got a plague.

25:30.112 --> 25:31.362
What about Friday?

25:32.364 --> 25:34.240
You'll have to check with Cameron.

25:34.450 --> 25:35.867
Oh, damn it!

25:36.118 --> 25:38.661
She always wants to know
why bad things happen.

25:38.787 --> 25:41.289
Like I'm gonna come up
with a new answer this time.

25:42.541 --> 25:43.625
House.

25:44.627 --> 25:46.586
Quick, God, smite the evil witch!

25:46.712 --> 25:47.879
Are you sitting on evidence

25:48.005 --> 25:50.006
that your patient
was sexually abused by her father?

25:50.132 --> 25:52.175
God, why have you forsaken me?

25:52.301 --> 25:55.678
Don't worry.
I've contacted child services for you.

25:55.804 --> 25:59.098
I let you get away
with more than anyone in this hospital.

25:59.225 --> 26:02.101
Shielding a child abuser isn't covered.

26:02.394 --> 26:05.897
Cooperate with this investigation
or I'll fire you.

26:09.610 --> 26:11.736
What do you think House
is gonna do to you?

26:11.862 --> 26:12.987
No idea.

26:13.113 --> 26:14.614
Well, you did the right thing.

26:15.282 --> 26:17.533
If you hadn't gone to Cuddy,
I would have.

26:17.660 --> 26:19.452
If this guy had known
we'd have to report him,

26:19.578 --> 26:21.329
he'd never have told House the truth.

26:21.664 --> 26:24.374
She's a child,
she needs to be protected.

26:24.583 --> 26:27.126
She dropped out of high school
to make millions of dollars.

26:27.253 --> 26:28.670
Why does she need more protection

26:28.796 --> 26:31.506
than some crack whore
shivering in the clinic waiting room?

26:31.632 --> 26:34.133
I think you're just afraid
to piss House off.

26:35.219 --> 26:36.803
There's that, too.

26:37.805 --> 26:40.556
MRI looks exactly the same
as it did two years ago.

26:40.683 --> 26:42.392
The nerves don't seem
to be regenerating.

26:42.518 --> 26:44.269
I figured as much.

26:44.395 --> 26:46.479
Several different researchers
have proven

26:46.605 --> 26:48.856
psychological pain
can manifest as physical pain.

26:48.983 --> 26:51.526
You think I have a conversion disorder?
You want me to see a shrink?

26:51.652 --> 26:54.487
Brilliant idea sending Stacy away.
It's really done wonders for you.

26:54.613 --> 26:56.531
Listen, none of this
has anything to do with Stacy.

26:56.657 --> 26:57.782
Right. Giant coincidence

26:57.908 --> 27:00.451
that you've gone completely
off the rails since she left.

27:00.577 --> 27:03.329
Inducing migraines, worsening leg pains.

27:04.540 --> 27:06.958
Oh, do you miss Stacy, too?

27:19.555 --> 27:22.307
Brain biopsy shows
no white matter disease.

27:22.599 --> 27:27.020
Cameron, you gonna tell Cuddy, or has
she already got you wired for sound?

27:29.273 --> 27:31.274
I had to do what I thought was right.

27:31.400 --> 27:34.652
So, white is out. It just leaves gray.

27:34.778 --> 27:38.990
Neuronal ceroid lipofucinosis,
Heller Syndrome...

27:39.116 --> 27:41.576
Any one of the mitochondrial
encephalopathies.

27:41.702 --> 27:42.702
Am I in trouble?

27:42.828 --> 27:44.829
You had to do
what you thought was right.

27:46.206 --> 27:49.000
They call it "gray area" because
you never really know what's there.

27:49.126 --> 27:50.793
We can't test for any of those things.

27:50.919 --> 27:52.420
So I'm not in trouble?

27:52.546 --> 27:54.756
You can torture yourself all you want.

27:58.010 --> 28:02.138
What if everything
we're seeing is just smoke signals?

28:02.514 --> 28:05.641
- Okay. Who's sending them?
- Tumor.

28:07.603 --> 28:09.437
If she has cancer anywhere in her body,

28:09.563 --> 28:12.065
she could also have
Paraneoplastic Syndrome,

28:12.191 --> 28:15.151
which could be causing antibodies
to attack her brain.

28:15.277 --> 28:16.611
Antibodies are stupid that way.

28:16.737 --> 28:19.697
Paraneoplastic Syndrome's
awfully rare in a 15-year-old.

28:19.865 --> 28:22.241
15-year-olds who look like
that are awfully rare.

28:22.368 --> 28:25.244
It would explain the aggressive
behavior, the cataplexy,

28:25.371 --> 28:27.705
the memory loss, even the twitching.
It's perfect.

28:27.831 --> 28:29.207
What if it's not?

28:29.333 --> 28:31.000
We could waste a week
searching for a tumor

28:31.126 --> 28:32.543
that we don't even know is there.

28:32.669 --> 28:34.379
Then let's make sure it is there.

28:34.505 --> 28:36.464
There's no test
for Paraneoplastic Syndrome.

28:36.590 --> 28:37.590
Sure there is.

28:37.716 --> 28:39.592
The "squeeze the tube" test.

28:41.136 --> 28:44.389
- What did the biopsy tell you?
- It wasn't definitive.

28:44.765 --> 28:49.477
But the twitching should stop
right about now.

28:53.857 --> 28:54.899
Oh, my God.

28:55.025 --> 28:56.859
Could have just been
a coincidence.

28:57.611 --> 29:00.613
Twitching does tend to stop and start.
Let's be sure.

29:05.494 --> 29:09.914
The IVIG vacuums her blood, neutralizes
the stuff that's making her twitch.

29:12.376 --> 29:13.960
It's actually kind of cool.

29:19.091 --> 29:21.050
- I wonder if I could make you dance.
- Enough.

29:21.176 --> 29:23.803
This is unbelievable.
You did it. You fixed her.

29:23.929 --> 29:24.929
No.

29:25.431 --> 29:27.974
All I did was prove that she has cancer.

29:35.399 --> 29:36.691
I need a favor.

29:39.820 --> 29:41.487
I'm not in a giving mood.

29:43.031 --> 29:44.323
It'll help us both.

29:44.783 --> 29:47.326
I need a shot of morphine in my spine.

29:48.287 --> 29:50.163
If your leg hurts, take your Vicodin.

29:50.539 --> 29:52.039
It's not enough.

29:53.333 --> 29:54.542
Get a syringe.

29:55.002 --> 29:57.044
Morphine is extreme, even for you.

29:57.171 --> 30:01.799
- Yeah. Write that on the insert.
- Get one of your lackeys to do it.

30:01.925 --> 30:03.176
I don't want them knowing...

30:03.302 --> 30:05.178
That you're on the road
to becoming a junkie?

30:05.304 --> 30:06.637
That I'm in this much pain.

30:06.763 --> 30:09.348
I don't want them
questioning my judgment.

30:09.475 --> 30:12.143
I can't ask Wilson, because he figures
it's all in my head.

30:12.269 --> 30:15.354
Well, I agree with him. I'm going home.

30:18.484 --> 30:21.652
- What about this?
- What are you doing?

30:22.321 --> 30:23.696
Is this in my head?

30:27.659 --> 30:30.786
Because I could swear
I remember a thigh muscle being here.

30:34.333 --> 30:35.833
I'll get a syringe.

31:30.013 --> 31:32.598
- It's gotta be cancer.
- It's not cancer.

31:33.684 --> 31:36.727
You seem to be
back to your old miserable self.

31:38.230 --> 31:41.399
So I just randomly predicted
she'd respond to IVIG?

31:41.858 --> 31:43.901
Her twitches are gone,
her memory's getting better.

31:44.027 --> 31:45.069
What did you take?

31:45.195 --> 31:47.405
The increased pain was psychological.

31:47.531 --> 31:48.906
No drug's gonna help.

31:49.032 --> 31:51.993
If you think it will help, the drugs
will help. The power of the mind.

31:52.119 --> 31:53.119
You're right.

31:53.245 --> 31:55.705
The more I talk to you,
the more the pain floods back.

31:56.790 --> 31:59.875
I knew the twins were real.
Chase owes me.

32:00.794 --> 32:03.087
- Did you check the pancreas?
- Oh, come on.

32:03.213 --> 32:05.631
You're just making up organs now,
aren't you?

32:05.757 --> 32:07.383
We checked the pancreas.

32:08.176 --> 32:11.053
- Obviously, you've taken something.
- Did you check the bones?

32:11.555 --> 32:14.640
- There are a lot of bones, I think.
- And none of them have cancer.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.350
- Ovaries?
- There's no mass.

32:16.476 --> 32:17.935
If anything, they're undersized.

32:18.061 --> 32:20.271
No leukemia, no Hodgkin's,
we checked everything.

32:20.397 --> 32:22.898
Unless they've invented a new organ,
it's not cancer.

32:30.449 --> 32:33.909
- Differential diagnosis.
- It's gotta be cancer.

32:34.036 --> 32:35.703
There's gotta be something we missed.

32:35.829 --> 32:37.371
You've got to learn to let go, Foreman.

32:37.497 --> 32:40.082
Maybe the protein level
was some sort of anomaly.

32:40.208 --> 32:41.667
It might just still be PTSD.

32:41.793 --> 32:43.252
Just PTSD?

32:43.378 --> 32:46.088
Yeah, Daddy's diddling her.
Nothing to worry about.

32:46.214 --> 32:47.632
Okay, let me rephrase.

32:47.758 --> 32:50.384
Maybe the protein level
was some sort of anomaly.

32:50.510 --> 32:52.845
Oh, my God! It might be PTSD!

32:52.971 --> 32:56.015
If it was PTSD, the twitching
wouldn't have magically disappeared

32:56.141 --> 32:57.975
when we started the IVIG.

32:58.602 --> 32:59.769
Wrong.

32:59.895 --> 33:03.189
What it wouldn't have done
was medically disappear.

33:03.982 --> 33:06.275
Nothing to stop it
from magically disappearing.

33:06.401 --> 33:09.070
She was watching me
start and stop the medicine.

33:09.196 --> 33:11.030
You think she's faking?

33:11.156 --> 33:12.531
Not consciously.

33:12.658 --> 33:15.159
But if her subconscious
is trying to get away from it all,

33:15.285 --> 33:17.495
cancer's gotta be
a lovely vacation spot.

33:19.498 --> 33:21.374
Tell her you've got to give her
a fresh IV.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.250
Don't tell her
you're starting her on saline.

33:23.377 --> 33:25.169
See if the twitching comes back.

33:31.468 --> 33:33.219
How long has the social worker
been in there?

33:33.345 --> 33:36.055
Just went in.
She was in with the dad before.

33:36.264 --> 33:39.225
- You switched the girl's IV?
- About a half an hour ago.

33:39.726 --> 33:41.394
When's she gonna start twitching?

33:41.520 --> 33:45.064
If she's gonna start twitching.
Another few minutes.

33:45.190 --> 33:47.942
We've got to wait for the remaining IVIG
to clear her system.

33:49.903 --> 33:51.987
That was quick. What's gonna happen?

33:52.114 --> 33:53.781
What'd you think was gonna happen?

33:54.408 --> 33:56.617
- The father had sex...
- Do you have any medical evidence?

33:56.743 --> 33:59.286
- He admitted...
- He denies the conversation took place.

33:59.413 --> 34:01.497
- But she...
- She denies it, too.

34:01.623 --> 34:03.082
I'm sure you meant well.

34:14.344 --> 34:16.137
You have to tell her the truth.

34:16.263 --> 34:17.513
Nothing happened.

34:17.639 --> 34:20.266
You don't have to be afraid of him.
They can protect you.

34:20.392 --> 34:22.184
From what? Things are fine.

34:25.355 --> 34:27.440
You think things are fine. They're not.

34:27.566 --> 34:29.734
- He's my dad.
- He's abusing you.

34:30.569 --> 34:32.319
He's not a bad person.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.364
I seduced him.

34:36.992 --> 34:39.577
You're the child. He's the adult.

34:40.036 --> 34:42.496
- He has the responsibility...
- I got him drunk.

34:43.540 --> 34:45.124
I had to get him drunk.

34:46.084 --> 34:48.043
I wanted to have sex with him.

34:48.420 --> 34:51.005
You're sexually attracted
to your father?

34:51.256 --> 34:57.762
No. But by sleeping with him,
now he lets me do whatever I want.

35:00.140 --> 35:05.102
I also slept with my photographer,
my financial manager and my tutor.

35:06.772 --> 35:11.025
If I hadn't, I'd be getting Cs

35:11.151 --> 35:14.278
and posing for newspaper ads
back in Detroit.

35:15.906 --> 35:18.908
- Come on, we all do it.
- No, we don't.

35:20.786 --> 35:22.953
After your father slept with you,
you were traumatized.

35:23.079 --> 35:25.372
My dad was last.

35:27.417 --> 35:31.128
You've never taken a run
at your boss or professor

35:31.254 --> 35:32.713
or somebody else you needed?

35:35.133 --> 35:37.760
You're 15. You're smart.

35:37.928 --> 35:40.930
- You don't have...
- I am not that smart.

35:43.099 --> 35:44.558
I am that beautiful.

35:55.612 --> 35:57.112
What's wrong with me?

36:02.661 --> 36:05.371
Oh! George, get your butt over here!

36:06.414 --> 36:08.332
- Help me.
- How'd you get my pager number?

36:08.458 --> 36:09.542
Please!

36:09.668 --> 36:13.087
The problem is,
if I give you an epidural,

36:13.213 --> 36:14.964
you won't be able to feel when to push.

36:15.090 --> 36:17.174
- You're not funny.
- I'm pretty sure I am.

36:17.300 --> 36:19.301
You just can't appreciate it
because you're in pain.

36:19.427 --> 36:22.388
George, if you don't get off your ass
and help me...

36:22.514 --> 36:24.431
Oh, shut up!

36:25.934 --> 36:28.769
You've got yourself the perfect man.
A woman.

36:29.187 --> 36:31.981
He's got more estrogen
coursing through his veins than...

36:38.029 --> 36:39.989
- Who did her vaginal exam?
- I did.

36:40.115 --> 36:42.533
- Did she have hair?
- What are you getting at?

36:42.659 --> 36:45.953
Right now I'm getting at whether or not
she had hair down there.

36:46.079 --> 36:47.246
Not much.

36:47.372 --> 36:50.249
She's manipulative,
yet completely docile.

36:50.375 --> 36:53.544
Everybody tells us that outburst
on the catwalk was out of character.

36:53.670 --> 36:56.755
- She's never had a period.
- You're thinking this is hormonal?

36:56.882 --> 36:59.174
I'm thinking she's the ultimate woman.

37:01.428 --> 37:02.761
I need to schedule an MRI.

37:05.307 --> 37:06.974
The twitching stopped.

37:08.101 --> 37:11.186
Because we changed your medicine
back to the real stuff.

37:11.313 --> 37:12.479
Stop talking.

37:12.606 --> 37:14.481
You gave me fake medicine?

37:15.650 --> 37:17.026
That's what I said,

37:17.152 --> 37:19.570
in the vain hope that you wouldn't feel
the need to also say it.

37:19.696 --> 37:21.196
Stop talking.

37:22.115 --> 37:25.159
Wilson already did an ultrasound.
He said her ovaries were undersized.

37:25.285 --> 37:28.996
The ultrasound would be the way to go
if you were looking for ovarian cancer.

37:29.122 --> 37:30.956
What are we looking for?

37:34.586 --> 37:35.794
That.

37:37.797 --> 37:39.173
Oh, my God.

37:41.009 --> 37:42.801
It looks like a tumor, doesn't it?

37:43.428 --> 37:46.430
- But those are...
- Yep.

38:01.821 --> 38:03.614
We found a tumor.

38:04.950 --> 38:06.325
She has cancer?

38:08.286 --> 38:11.956
- Technically, no.
- So it's not cancer?

38:12.457 --> 38:16.085
No, it's cancer, but "he" has cancer

38:18.672 --> 38:21.048
on "his" left testicle.

38:23.635 --> 38:26.679
- I don't have testicles.
- She's not a guy.

38:27.263 --> 38:29.306
His DNA says you're wrong.

38:30.475 --> 38:33.519
Frogs and snails and puppy dog tails.

38:34.688 --> 38:37.815
You've got male
pseudohermaphroditism.

38:38.483 --> 38:40.526
You see, we all start out as girls

38:40.652 --> 38:43.570
and then we're differentiated,
based on our genes.

38:44.072 --> 38:47.366
The ovaries develop
into testes and drop.

38:48.994 --> 38:52.121
But in about one
in every 150,000 pregnancies,

38:52.247 --> 38:53.622
the fetus with an XY chromosome

38:53.748 --> 38:56.291
a boy, develops into something else,

38:56.793 --> 38:58.127
like you.

38:59.087 --> 39:03.173
Your testes never descended,
because you're immune to testosterone.

39:04.009 --> 39:05.634
You're pure estrogen.

39:06.553 --> 39:09.847
Which is why you have heightened
female
characteristics,

39:09.973 --> 39:13.183
clear skin, great breasts.

39:14.936 --> 39:17.604
The ultimate woman is a man.

39:19.983 --> 39:21.358
Nature's cruel, huh?

39:21.484 --> 39:26.196
This is obviously a joke.
This is impossible.

39:27.365 --> 39:30.784
No. A joke would be
me calling you a homo.

39:30.910 --> 39:32.286
You see the difference?

39:33.705 --> 39:35.873
I'll schedule him for surgery.

39:38.585 --> 39:43.213
No! You're wrong!
I'm a girl! Look at me!

39:43.548 --> 39:45.507
How could you say I'm not a girl?

39:46.051 --> 39:49.261
You see, they're all looking at me.
I'm beautiful!

39:52.098 --> 39:55.184
That anger.
It's just the cancer talking.

39:58.855 --> 40:02.066
Put your clothes back on.
We're gonna cut your balls off.

40:02.192 --> 40:03.442
Then you'll be fine.

40:37.769 --> 40:40.312
- How's the patient?
- Post-op.

40:41.481 --> 40:44.733
They sent him/her up for a psyche visit.

40:45.401 --> 40:48.487
Calling her a "him/her"
isn't really helping.

40:48.613 --> 40:52.574
The good news is, I don't think Dad's
gonna be sleeping with him/her again.

40:52.700 --> 40:54.284
You see, now it's gross.

40:59.207 --> 41:00.791
I need another shot.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.002
When did the pain start coming back?

41:04.129 --> 41:05.504
A few hours ago.

41:06.131 --> 41:08.507
About an hour after you solved the case?

41:09.926 --> 41:13.846
If I wanted to be psychoanalyzed,
I'd get Wilson to give me the shot.

41:14.264 --> 41:15.597
Same dosage?

41:17.350 --> 41:18.642
If you'd be more comfortable,

41:18.768 --> 41:21.562
I might be able to deal
with a few less CCs of morphine.

41:21.855 --> 41:23.272
It wasn't morphine.

41:25.984 --> 41:28.360
What did you give me?
I told you I wanted...

41:28.486 --> 41:29.820
It was saline.

41:30.905 --> 41:32.739
I gave you a placebo.
