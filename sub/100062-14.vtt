WEBVTT

00:04.004 --> 00:05.406
Magic Kingdom, Epcot,

00:05.439 --> 00:07.208
the Monorail --
where to start?

00:07.241 --> 00:10.411
I can't wait
to feel Gaston's biceps.

00:10.444 --> 00:11.912
I can't believe we've lived
in Orlando for six years

00:11.945 --> 00:13.081
and never been to Disney.

00:13.114 --> 00:15.149
Well, they should've allowed
Orlando residents

00:15.183 --> 00:17.485
a discount before today.

00:17.518 --> 00:18.652
This is the best day ever.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.654
I'm gonna ride Space Mountain
till I puke.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.823
Eddie,
hit us with some tunage

00:22.856 --> 00:24.758
to commemorate the happiest
moment of our lives.

00:24.792 --> 00:26.160
On it.

00:26.194 --> 00:29.430
All: "Hakuna Matata!"

00:29.463 --> 00:31.031
What a wonderful phrase.

00:33.067 --> 00:34.735
Hakuna Matata!

00:34.768 --> 00:37.705
* Ain't no passing craze

00:37.738 --> 00:44.078
* It means no worries
for the rest of your days *

00:44.112 --> 00:49.683
* It's our problem-free
philosophy *

00:49.717 --> 00:51.752
* Hakuna Matata

00:53.254 --> 00:55.055
All: Nooooooo!

00:55.089 --> 00:57.057
It's our fault.

00:57.091 --> 00:58.926
We were too happy.

00:58.959 --> 01:01.295
-- Captions by VITAC --

01:01.329 --> 01:02.563
* Fresh off the boat

01:02.596 --> 01:04.232
* I'm gettin' mine
everywhere I go *

01:04.265 --> 01:06.534
* If you don't know, homey,
now you know *

01:06.567 --> 01:07.768
* Fresh off the boat

01:07.801 --> 01:10.104
* Homey, you don't know
where I come from *

01:10.138 --> 01:11.439
* But I know where I'm goin'

01:11.472 --> 01:14.408
* I'm fresh off the boat

01:15.843 --> 01:18.612
That tow truck driver
did not like you.

01:18.646 --> 01:21.215
We could've had a nice,
silent drive back,

01:21.249 --> 01:24.452
but no, you had to ask that guy
how he got into towing.

01:24.485 --> 01:25.586
I wanted to butter him up

01:25.619 --> 01:27.488
before asking
if he ever towed a celebrity.

01:27.521 --> 01:29.623
Oh, remind me,
who did he tow?

01:30.658 --> 01:31.959
Kathy Griffin.

01:31.992 --> 01:34.128
Hey. Good news --

01:34.162 --> 01:36.464
I finally found the wrench
I needed to fix your van.

01:36.497 --> 01:38.166
Oh, great!

01:38.199 --> 01:41.135
See, Louis,
I told you it's not a big deal.

01:41.169 --> 01:42.836
Ah, I should've told you
the bad news first.

01:42.870 --> 01:44.472
The wrench didn't do so much.

01:44.505 --> 01:45.806
You need to take her
to a mechanic.

01:45.839 --> 01:47.941
This job
is beyond my capability.

01:47.975 --> 01:49.477
It took you six hours

01:49.510 --> 01:51.479
to determine
it's beyond your capability?

01:51.512 --> 01:54.081
You had mice
in your air filter.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.949
I saw a live birth.

01:55.983 --> 01:57.285
20 babies.

01:57.318 --> 01:59.653
Fine, we'll have it towed
to the mechanic tomorrow.

01:59.687 --> 02:02.290
Eddie can use the Cattlecar
to drive the boys around.

02:02.323 --> 02:04.625
Man, I can't believe the van
is so out of shape.

02:04.658 --> 02:06.860
Maybe if you didn't constantly
ride her brakes

02:06.894 --> 02:08.462
and just let
the old gal dance...

02:08.496 --> 02:10.798
Me?! You're the one
who comes to a complete stop

02:10.831 --> 02:12.166
at every intersection.

02:12.200 --> 02:14.468
Why don't you just roll through
like a normal person?

02:14.502 --> 02:17.305
That's why I love the ocean.
No stop signs.

02:17.338 --> 02:20.474
You try to put one up,
it sinks right to the bottom.

02:20.508 --> 02:22.476
Can't you just put it
on a buoy?

02:22.510 --> 02:24.178
Oh, you have
a three-mile-long anchor

02:24.212 --> 02:25.913
to keep that buoy in place,
wise-ass?

02:27.881 --> 02:30.484
We have to clean out the van
before the tow truck arrives.

02:30.518 --> 02:31.485
They steal.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.326
Oh, look, a receipt

02:38.359 --> 02:40.828
from that time we got Sheila
washed professionally.

02:40.861 --> 02:43.897
Oh, I saved that in case
I wanted to return the car wash.

02:43.931 --> 02:46.267
Remember? It was right after
you tased me.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.671
Richard Ramirez,
Night Stalker!

02:51.739 --> 02:53.173
What a memory.

02:53.207 --> 02:54.875
Mm. It's trash.

02:54.908 --> 02:56.644
That's fine.
I have another keepsake.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.178
The taser
threw off my heartbeat.

02:58.212 --> 03:00.080
It skips a thump-thump
every now and then.

03:00.113 --> 03:01.482
Keep cleaning.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.489
Whoa. A fry.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.358
It's hard as a rock.
Dibs.

03:11.425 --> 03:12.760
Oh! My old earpiece!
Wow.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.862
I lost this
on the trip down here from D.C.

03:14.895 --> 03:17.265
Louis: * I saw the sign

03:17.298 --> 03:20.601
* And it opened up my eyes,
I saw the sign *

03:20.634 --> 03:21.935
* Life is dema--
Ugh, Dad,
turn off the music!

03:21.969 --> 03:23.404
Six years later,
and we're still

03:23.437 --> 03:24.905
a bunch of dorks
singing in a van.

03:24.938 --> 03:26.774
Check it out.
My old swim trunks!

03:26.807 --> 03:29.109
Oh, from when we tried
to take the van for a joyride.

03:29.142 --> 03:30.244
Wait!

03:30.278 --> 03:31.945
We need our bathing suits
for Wet 'n Wild!

03:31.979 --> 03:33.814
My swimmies!

03:42.155 --> 03:43.924
We did not make it far.

03:43.957 --> 03:45.459
What's this map?

03:45.493 --> 03:47.060
Let me see that bad boy.

03:47.094 --> 03:50.964
I drew this map after we buried
that time capsule in D.C.

03:50.998 --> 03:51.899
I wonder if it's still there.

03:51.932 --> 03:53.601
A map?
Possible treasure?

03:53.634 --> 03:56.604
It's like "The Goonies,"
but with three Asian boys!

03:56.637 --> 03:59.407
Three inoffensive
Asian boys.
Hmm.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.775
I can't even remember what we
put in that time capsule.

04:01.809 --> 04:03.644
Hmm. I was 10.

04:03.677 --> 04:05.379
But if I know
young Eddie,

04:05.413 --> 04:07.114
that little scamp probably
put a bag of farts in there.

04:07.147 --> 04:10.284
How you got a 1500 on your SATs,
I'll never know.

04:10.318 --> 04:12.886
Yeah. To be honest, I never
thought you'd get into college.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.288
Yeah, we just assumed
you'd live at home forever.

04:14.322 --> 04:15.289
Me too.

04:15.323 --> 04:17.157
Turns out my brain
had other plans.

04:17.190 --> 04:19.727
It's gonna be weird when it's
not the three of us anymore.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.795
Yeah.
It just won't be the same.

04:24.432 --> 04:25.466
Poor Sheila.

04:25.499 --> 04:27.335
We bought this van
on our wedding night.

04:27.368 --> 04:29.136
I taught Eddie
how to drive in it.

04:29.169 --> 04:30.771
I remember things, too,
Louis.

04:30.804 --> 04:33.907
It's just we've been through
so much with this van.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.008
So many memories.

04:35.042 --> 04:37.778
Yes.
Here's a new memory --

04:37.811 --> 04:39.179
I'm taking this car
down to Kareem's.

04:39.212 --> 04:40.180
You stay here.

04:40.213 --> 04:41.615
They always talk you

04:41.649 --> 04:45.018
into buying unnecessary upgrades
and nonsensical trinkets.

04:45.052 --> 04:48.322
I'm sure I have no idea
what you mean.

04:49.323 --> 04:50.123
Oh.

04:50.157 --> 04:51.291
So I always know

04:51.325 --> 04:52.960
where to put my hands
on the steering wheel.

04:57.365 --> 04:58.966
Ah.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.468
Is that suit
really necessary?

05:00.501 --> 05:03.003
Hey, I respect
our piano teacher.

05:03.036 --> 05:05.105
The first song he taught us
was "Chopsticks."

05:05.138 --> 05:07.307
Does that not bother you?
Because it bothers me.

05:07.341 --> 05:08.642
Well, I'm glad you guys

05:08.676 --> 05:10.310
have mixed feelings
on this piano teacher

05:10.344 --> 05:12.212
because...
you're not going.

05:12.245 --> 05:13.514
But we're finally
gonna find out

05:13.547 --> 05:14.882
what that middle pedal
does today!

05:14.915 --> 05:16.316
Well,
this pedal hits the gas,

05:16.350 --> 05:17.785
and we're riding it
all the way to D.C.

05:17.818 --> 05:18.986
What?!What?!

05:19.019 --> 05:21.154
We're finally doing
that Huang boys road trip.

05:21.188 --> 05:23.023
And this time,
there's no stopping us.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.459
Oh, we're way below E.

05:25.493 --> 05:27.127
Did you guys bring
your wallet?

05:27.160 --> 05:30.498
Because typically, the driver
doesn't pay for gas, so...

05:30.531 --> 05:32.299
* Yeah

05:32.332 --> 05:34.668
This close call with Sheila's
really got me thinking

05:34.702 --> 05:36.169
how much
I take her for granted.

05:36.203 --> 05:38.839
As soon as we get her back, I'm
gonna change her oil every day.

05:38.872 --> 05:41.308
You know
who burns a lot of oil?

05:41.341 --> 05:42.743
Dale Earnhardt.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.545
What a racist.

05:44.578 --> 05:45.979
You mean, "racer"?

05:46.013 --> 05:47.981
Ma, you gotta go back
to using Mandarin.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.249
You're gonna get in trouble.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.886
Hey!
How's the van doing?

05:52.920 --> 05:53.887
Great.

05:53.921 --> 05:55.355
I sold it.

06:02.262 --> 06:03.931
You sold Sheila?!

06:03.964 --> 06:05.098
It needed too much work

06:05.132 --> 06:07.200
and the mechanic at Kareem's
offered to buy it.

06:07.234 --> 06:08.736
It was
the pragmatic solution.

06:08.769 --> 06:10.738
I can't believe
you made such a big decision

06:10.771 --> 06:12.172
without consulting me!

06:12.205 --> 06:15.943
Says the guy who purchased
multiple vehicles without me --

06:15.976 --> 06:19.279
the Accord, the riding
lawn mower, the 40-foot RV --

06:19.312 --> 06:21.114
It was 35, but point taken.

06:21.148 --> 06:22.450
And this is different.

06:22.483 --> 06:24.217
She was practically
a member of our family.

06:24.251 --> 06:26.053
There are days I wish
she lived in the garage

06:26.086 --> 06:26.854
instead of Grandma.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.756
Every day I wish that.

06:28.789 --> 06:30.758
But Louis,
this is just a hunk of metal.

06:30.791 --> 06:33.126
Get over it.

06:33.160 --> 06:36.930
Robo-Cop was just a hunk
of metal, and he saved a town!

06:36.964 --> 06:39.633
I assume.
Never saw it.

06:41.769 --> 06:44.271
Okay, the Cattlecar's
got a full tank,

06:44.304 --> 06:46.574
and I got the next three meals
taken care of --

06:46.607 --> 06:47.741
bag o' hot dogs.

06:47.775 --> 06:49.376
I'm vegan.
I don't eat hot dogs.

06:49.409 --> 06:50.611
Me neither.

06:50.644 --> 06:52.913
After I read "mechanically
separated" on the label.

06:52.946 --> 06:54.448
It doesn't matter.

06:54.482 --> 06:55.949
We're not going
on a road trip to D.C.

06:55.983 --> 06:56.984
Yes, you are!

06:57.017 --> 06:58.486
You guys need to learn
to live a little.

06:58.519 --> 06:59.787
I'm gonna be gone soon.
There's gonna be nobody around

06:59.820 --> 07:01.755
to teach you guys
how to have fun.

07:01.789 --> 07:03.957
Fun? You're about to drive us
1,200 miles

07:03.991 --> 07:06.460
with no plan, no luggage,

07:06.494 --> 07:07.661
and a bagful
of gas station hot dogs.

07:07.695 --> 07:09.763
And I don't even have
my night guard.

07:09.797 --> 07:11.932
Guys, we'll figure that out
as we go.

07:11.965 --> 07:13.133
That's the fun of it!

07:13.166 --> 07:14.768
Oh yeah,
gonna be a real bounce house

07:14.802 --> 07:16.970
when Mom figures out
we've been missing for two days.

07:17.004 --> 07:18.438
I've already
got that covered.

07:18.472 --> 07:20.508
I told Mom we're having
a sleepover at Walter's.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.910
As long as we're back tomorrow
by 8:00 p.m., we're good.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.945
Okay,
what're you hiding?

07:24.978 --> 07:27.347
Most Eddie adventures
are all about Eddie.

07:27.380 --> 07:28.682
Hence the name.

07:28.716 --> 07:31.151
Ed-ventures.

07:31.184 --> 07:32.753
Never mind.
I'll trademark that later.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.454
You guys are right.
I do want something --

07:34.488 --> 07:36.957
I wanna find out
what's inside that time capsule.

07:36.990 --> 07:37.958
Don't you?

07:37.991 --> 07:40.093
I'm a little intrigued.
Yeah.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.262
Baseball cards, stamps,
comic books.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.464
You guys were into a ton
of nerd crap.

07:44.498 --> 07:46.133
Hell of a sales pitch,
Eddie.

07:46.166 --> 07:49.537
Sorry, nerd...stuff.

07:49.570 --> 07:52.139
Point is, real people
are into that junk now.

07:52.172 --> 07:53.306
That's true.

07:53.340 --> 07:54.474
There could be something
in there worth money.

07:54.508 --> 07:57.044
Yes! And depending on
how deep we buried it,

07:57.077 --> 07:58.145
we could hit oil.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.115
Okay, we're in.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.617
* Yeah

08:03.651 --> 08:04.885
You packed shovels, right?

08:04.918 --> 08:07.220
Sure.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.628
Ho, boss.
Whoa.

08:14.662 --> 08:15.896
What's with the heavy
cattle hands here?

08:15.929 --> 08:18.365
Things okay at home?
It's Jessica.

08:18.398 --> 08:19.633
Ohh. Divorce?

08:19.667 --> 08:21.068
You did it, Lou.

08:21.101 --> 08:23.136
Well, the first time
always feels the best.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.472
Honestly,
we all saw it coming.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.307
Mi futon es su futon.

08:27.340 --> 08:30.143
Hector, it's happening!
What? No!

08:30.177 --> 08:31.478
Our van's dead.

08:31.511 --> 08:32.980
Sheila?!
She was family!

08:33.013 --> 08:34.414
How are you even at work
right now?

08:34.447 --> 08:35.649
See? You get it.

08:35.683 --> 08:36.817
That van's been a part
of so many memories,

08:36.850 --> 08:38.886
and it's like Jessica
doesn't even care.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.187
We bought it
on our wedding night.

08:40.220 --> 08:41.755
Yeah, when I said goodbye
to my Jag,

08:41.789 --> 08:43.356
I didn't leave my house
for a month.

08:43.390 --> 08:44.858
Couldn't even bear the sight
of another car.

08:44.892 --> 08:46.259
Still can't.

08:46.293 --> 08:48.195
She always sweeps her emotions
under the rug,

08:48.228 --> 08:49.930
and that isn't a healthy way
to grieve.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.031
Or clean.

08:51.064 --> 08:53.100
Whoa,
Trent with the quick wit.

08:53.133 --> 08:54.267
Orange lightning.

08:54.301 --> 08:55.936
I've been trying
to pay better attention.

08:55.969 --> 08:58.538
Well, it's working.
I don't know, Lou.

08:58.572 --> 09:00.073
This doesn't make
any sense to me.

09:00.107 --> 09:02.209
Maybe the car doesn't mean
that much to Jessica.

09:02.242 --> 09:03.711
Of course it means
something to her.

09:03.744 --> 09:05.913
I have to help her learn
to process her feelings,

09:05.946 --> 09:07.781
get her to admit
she's sad about the van.

09:07.815 --> 09:10.884
If she doesn't, I'm worried
it'll explode out of her.

09:10.918 --> 09:12.219
Like the alien in "Alien."

09:12.252 --> 09:14.221
Oof, I do not see
scary movies anymore

09:14.254 --> 09:16.724
ever since I did a pee-pee
during "The Exorcist."

09:20.060 --> 09:24.097
* And the caravan
is painted red and white *

09:24.131 --> 09:25.699
What are you doing?

09:25.733 --> 09:28.101
Oh, listening
to a little Van Morrison.

09:28.135 --> 09:30.570
Reading about Martin Van Buren.

09:30.604 --> 09:33.073
Eating some van- illa ice cream.

09:33.106 --> 09:34.608
Just another normal day
in Louis-ville.

09:34.642 --> 09:36.977
Louis,
you're not a multitasker.

09:37.010 --> 09:39.446
You're gonna give yourself
a cold.

09:39.479 --> 09:41.649
* ...tells us of her ways *

09:42.850 --> 09:44.484
* La, la, la-la

09:44.517 --> 09:45.552
Hey!

09:45.585 --> 09:46.553
We just passed the sign

09:46.586 --> 09:47.788
for the world's biggest peanut.

09:47.821 --> 09:49.456
You guys always wanted
to see that, right?

09:49.489 --> 09:51.625
Both: Peanut! Peanut!

09:51.659 --> 09:55.128
All: Peanut! Peanut!
Peanut! Peanut!

09:55.162 --> 09:58.966
* Turn up

09:58.999 --> 10:00.634
* Your radio

10:02.703 --> 10:05.639
* And let me hear a song
Louis.

10:06.807 --> 10:10.143
Why am I sleeping
on an auto part?

10:10.177 --> 10:12.112
Oh, how'd that get there?
Poor little guy.

10:12.145 --> 10:15.115
Probably misses you and all
the memories you had together.

10:15.148 --> 10:18.819
* What is really wrong

10:18.852 --> 10:21.288
Eddie: I know
this is a controversial take,

10:21.321 --> 10:23.290
but I'm more of a moon guy.

10:23.323 --> 10:25.625
If this is a set-up
to you mooning us,

10:25.659 --> 10:27.294
I'm not
falling for it again.

10:27.327 --> 10:29.529
You guys
are getting smarter.

10:29.562 --> 10:32.666
Louis: You know what
we never do anymore?

10:32.700 --> 10:34.935
Walk down memory lane.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.603
You know...

10:36.636 --> 10:39.973
...relive our wedding night,
when we bought the van?

10:40.007 --> 10:41.274
It was magical.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.777
Oh, Louis.

10:43.811 --> 10:45.813
I've been thinking
about the van, too.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.480
You have?

10:47.514 --> 10:49.282
Yes.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.451
We have to get rid of
that poop-mobile.

10:51.484 --> 10:52.820
* La-la, la la

10:54.321 --> 10:57.157
I think I might've put on
your tuxedo by mistake,

10:57.190 --> 10:58.491
because this is tight.

11:02.562 --> 11:04.364
Well,
we made it to D.C.

11:04.397 --> 11:05.866
With time to spare.

11:05.899 --> 11:07.634
And that includes
the three hours we wasted

11:07.667 --> 11:09.870
before we realized you were
driving to Washington state.

11:09.903 --> 11:11.805
Hey, I didn't hear
many complaints

11:11.839 --> 11:13.707
when you were dipping your toes
in the Chattahoochee.

11:13.741 --> 11:16.877
Guys, don't hate me, but I've
gotta quote Madonna here --

11:16.910 --> 11:18.879
this used to be
our playground.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.514
I'll allow it.

11:21.548 --> 11:22.582
We used to love
those swings.

11:22.615 --> 11:24.051
Hey,
and the metal slide.

11:24.084 --> 11:26.319
Eddie burned his butt on it
that summer.
Worth it.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.321
I made 2 bucks
off Grandma.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.557
Okay, now let's bust out
this map and get to digging.

11:33.861 --> 11:36.096
Ugh, those hot dogs
are starting to fight back.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.365
So, if "X" marks the spot,

11:38.398 --> 11:40.200
why are there so many on here?

11:40.233 --> 11:42.269
To throw people off the scent
in case someone finds our map.

11:42.302 --> 11:44.571
So, you have no idea
which "X" is the right one.

11:44.604 --> 11:45.705
This map is useless.

11:45.739 --> 11:47.775
Hey! Don't be mad
at 10-year-old Eddie.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.042
That dude was the best.

11:51.078 --> 11:53.046
Guys, it's not
the end of the world.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.547
So we have to dig
a few more holes.

11:54.581 --> 11:55.749
We'll do it together.

12:00.788 --> 12:02.655
Eddie: Try over there
by the tree.

12:04.324 --> 12:07.227
I have an idea --
why don't you help us
find the time capsule?

12:07.260 --> 12:08.929
I can't.
I keep throwing up.

12:08.962 --> 12:11.564
And half of me is shivering,
and half of me is sweating.

12:11.598 --> 12:13.200
I'm not a doctor,
but I think I might've picked up

12:13.233 --> 12:15.102
a waterborne parasite
in the Chattahooch'.

12:15.135 --> 12:16.636
Or maybe it was one of
the two dozen

12:16.669 --> 12:18.138
gas station hot dogs
that you ate.

12:18.171 --> 12:19.439
I hope not.

12:19.472 --> 12:21.441
Last time I was taken down
by a pack of gas dogs,

12:21.474 --> 12:22.910
I was out of commission
for days.

12:22.943 --> 12:24.778
Last time?
Why do you keep eating them?

12:24.812 --> 12:26.579
Why do they keep making them?

12:26.613 --> 12:28.048
If you can't drive us home
in time,

12:28.081 --> 12:29.449
Mom's gonna find out
and kill us.

12:29.482 --> 12:31.084
I-I-I think I can drive.

12:31.118 --> 12:34.587
I just can't sit, think,
or process moving objects.

12:34.621 --> 12:37.290
Of course this is happening.
This is so typical Eddie.

12:37.324 --> 12:39.626
Sorry for trying
to show you guys a fun time.

12:39.659 --> 12:41.161
This is fun to you?!

12:41.194 --> 12:42.629
You're doubled over
in the fetal position,

12:42.662 --> 12:45.298
we're digging holes, stressed
out about how to get home.

12:45.332 --> 12:47.434
And I'm wearing a suit!

12:47.467 --> 12:49.136
You're the best-dressed guy
in this local park.

12:49.169 --> 12:50.403
What are you
complaining about?

12:50.437 --> 12:51.805
You know what?
Who cares.

12:51.839 --> 12:53.941
At least this is the last time
we're gonna have to do this.

12:53.974 --> 12:55.608
What's that
supposed to mean?

12:55.642 --> 12:56.776
It means you'll be gone,

12:56.810 --> 12:58.311
and we won't have to deal
with your nonsense.

12:58.345 --> 13:00.780
Can't come soon enough for me.

13:00.814 --> 13:01.781
Aah.

13:01.815 --> 13:05.585
I'll be in the car.
Windows down.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.487
God,
I can't take Eddie anymore.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.022
He's the worst.

13:12.893 --> 13:16.363
Hey, Louis, look.
Automatic sliding doors.

13:18.731 --> 13:21.468
It's not fast or practical,
but I must have it.

13:21.501 --> 13:23.270
But so expensive.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.873
I wonder if they have
any used ones.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.142
Would ya lookie here!

13:29.176 --> 13:30.810
It's Sheila.

13:30.844 --> 13:32.779
Would you like to say
anything to her?

13:32.812 --> 13:35.048
Louis, that's enough!
It's just a car!

13:35.082 --> 13:36.316
Jessica, it's ridiculous

13:36.349 --> 13:38.551
that our van
doesn't mean anything to you.

13:38.585 --> 13:42.489
We raised our family in this.
It's practically a part of us!

13:42.522 --> 13:44.124
Look at them.

13:46.927 --> 13:48.061
Really? Nothing?

13:48.095 --> 13:49.829
Hey, I'm Calvin.

13:49.863 --> 13:51.231
Can I help
put you in a van today?

13:52.332 --> 13:55.235
Wait.
You look familiar.

13:55.268 --> 13:56.569
Didn't you buy a giant RV,

13:56.603 --> 13:59.039
then try to return it with your
wife's picture on the side?

13:59.072 --> 14:01.574
No, that doesn't sound
like us.

14:03.076 --> 14:05.478
'Cause I could swear
that's her.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.347
Stealing one of our vans.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.983
Whoa!

14:10.017 --> 14:11.751
She just blew through
that stop sign.

14:16.756 --> 14:17.557
So, your wife
just drove off the property?

14:19.626 --> 14:21.761
That's pretty bad-ass,
except for the felony part.

14:21.794 --> 14:23.763
Oh, I knew something bad
like this might happen.

14:23.796 --> 14:26.066
She's been repressing her
feelings, and it's not healthy.

14:26.099 --> 14:26.934
Sure.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.401
We have two options here.

14:28.435 --> 14:30.570
We can either
call the police

14:30.603 --> 14:33.706
or we can
buddy-cop this mother ourselves

14:33.740 --> 14:35.042
and chase her down.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.610
Um, the not
call-the-police one.

14:37.644 --> 14:39.246
I was really hoping
you'd say that.

14:39.279 --> 14:41.048
It's been a fantasy of mine
for a while.

14:41.081 --> 14:42.950
Oh, great. We need to hurry.
She's getting away.

14:42.983 --> 14:45.618
That's how
the fantasy always starts.

14:45.652 --> 14:48.555
Unfortunately, I'm only allowed
to take a vehicle off the lot

14:48.588 --> 14:49.756
if it's for a test drive.

14:49.789 --> 14:51.558
Fine!
Whatever it takes, let's go!

14:51.591 --> 14:53.593
Great!
I just need your license

14:53.626 --> 14:55.395
so I can make a few copies,
we have to fill out a few forms,

14:55.428 --> 14:57.230
then we'll be on our way.

14:57.264 --> 14:58.765
Alright.

14:58.798 --> 15:00.600
Um, hey, which car do you wanna
take as the chase van?

15:00.633 --> 15:03.136
Uh, the blue, the gold,
or the red?

15:03.170 --> 15:04.604
Any car is fine.

15:04.637 --> 15:07.707
Heyyy,
Calvin's got one on the hook.

15:10.978 --> 15:12.779
I can't believe
we found the time capsule.

15:12.812 --> 15:14.281
I can't believe
how many pet collars we dug up.

15:14.314 --> 15:15.782
So many named "Rover."

15:15.815 --> 15:17.117
Mm.
Take 10 minutes
to brainstorm.

15:17.150 --> 15:18.818
It's a member
of your family.

15:18.851 --> 15:20.253
Let's just hope
there's something

15:20.287 --> 15:22.822
valuable enough in here
to get us plane tickets home.
Yeah.

15:24.992 --> 15:25.825
My rubber ducky!

15:25.858 --> 15:27.227
Ronnie Hardnose!

15:27.260 --> 15:29.096
That's right.
You were in a big bath phase.

15:29.129 --> 15:31.598
I was into self-care
before it got cool.
Mm.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.301
A bag of farts.

15:34.334 --> 15:36.136
Eddie.
At least he's consistent.

15:38.671 --> 15:39.772
A picture of Mom?

15:39.806 --> 15:40.773
That's mine!

15:40.807 --> 15:42.609
She hasn't aged a day.

15:43.810 --> 15:46.179
I remember
why we put this stuff in here.

15:46.213 --> 15:47.780
We were super sad
about moving.

15:47.814 --> 15:49.849
And Eddie said if we buried
our most prized possessions,

15:49.882 --> 15:51.618
we'd always have a reason
to come back here.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.154
He was right.

15:54.187 --> 15:56.456
10-year-old Eddie
really was the best dude.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.358
Present-day Eddie's
not too bad either.

15:58.391 --> 15:59.459
Hmm.
We're lucky to have him.

15:59.492 --> 16:02.129
Mm.

16:02.162 --> 16:03.696
You're not gonna believe this.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.432
Eddie's at the back
of this photo,

16:05.465 --> 16:06.633
and look what he's holding.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.668
A hot dog?!

16:08.701 --> 16:09.569
I mean, what is his deal?

16:14.641 --> 16:15.675
Damn!

16:15.708 --> 16:17.044
Did she just swerve
to make a right turn

16:17.077 --> 16:18.178
all the way
from the left lane?

16:18.211 --> 16:19.279
She trying to lose us?

16:19.312 --> 16:20.680
No.
That's just how she drives.

16:22.249 --> 16:25.385
Crap! Where'd she go?

16:28.655 --> 16:30.157
Oh. She's going west.

16:30.190 --> 16:32.559
Which we know, thanks to the
in-mirror digital compass.

16:32.592 --> 16:35.228
Honestly, I don't know
how much more technology

16:35.262 --> 16:36.996
you could put in a car.
Alright, I get it.

16:38.565 --> 16:39.899
We found the time capsule.

16:39.932 --> 16:42.035
What was in it --
betrayal?

16:42.069 --> 16:43.536
Actually,
it was a rubber duck,

16:43.570 --> 16:45.238
a picture of Mom,
and a bag of farts.

16:45.272 --> 16:46.206
Ew.

16:46.239 --> 16:47.507
A picture of Mom?

16:47.540 --> 16:50.009
Sorry about earlier.
It really was a fun trip.

16:50.043 --> 16:51.911
Yeah,
thanks for kidnapping us.

16:51.944 --> 16:53.813
You were right --
we needed it.

16:53.846 --> 16:54.981
Actually, you were right.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.749
I wasn't doing it for you,
I did it for me.

16:56.783 --> 16:58.185
I wanted more time
with you.

16:59.452 --> 17:00.920
I'm gonna miss you guys.

17:02.955 --> 17:04.091
Alright, let's go.
I'll drive.

17:04.124 --> 17:05.392
Are you sure
you can do it?

17:05.425 --> 17:07.994
Not at all.
But we're gonna try.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.396
One last adventure.

17:09.429 --> 17:11.364
Ed-venture.

17:13.966 --> 17:15.268
Louis:
She's pulling over.

17:15.302 --> 17:17.604
Probably 'cause we only put
a gallon of gas in there.

17:17.637 --> 17:20.107
Remember,
Kareem play defense first.
Ah.

17:20.140 --> 17:22.842
Thanks for letting me borrow the
van for a test-drive, Calvin.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.211
Hey, I got an extra ticket
tomorrow night

17:24.244 --> 17:25.212
to the Orlando Magic.

17:25.245 --> 17:26.279
Wanna come with?

17:30.650 --> 17:33.253
I always overstep.

17:36.289 --> 17:39.058
Um, Jessica?
You stole a car.

17:39.092 --> 17:40.260
Yeah.

17:40.293 --> 17:41.228
Why?

17:41.261 --> 17:42.595
Because of you.

17:42.629 --> 17:43.630
Me?!

17:43.663 --> 17:44.731
Yes!

17:44.764 --> 17:46.433
You kept pushing me
and pushing me,

17:46.466 --> 17:47.600
and I finally snapped.

17:47.634 --> 17:49.436
Well, I pushed you
to confront your feelings

17:49.469 --> 17:52.105
because it's crazy that this van
means nothing to you.

17:52.139 --> 17:54.574
Of course the van
means something to me.

17:54.607 --> 17:56.042
Taking it to the mechanic

17:56.075 --> 17:58.478
was one of the worst days
of my life...

17:59.779 --> 18:01.381
I'm not leaving
without a free oil change.

18:01.414 --> 18:04.717
And I want you to take down that
naked lady calendar behind you.

18:04.751 --> 18:07.053
Unfortunately, the van's gonna
need more than an oil change.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.321
I mean, truth be told,

18:08.355 --> 18:10.089
it's gonna cost so much
to repair,

18:10.123 --> 18:11.324
you might as well sell it.

18:11.358 --> 18:13.092
You mean you can't fix it?

18:13.126 --> 18:14.494
I know, it's tough.

18:14.527 --> 18:16.329
I mean, I see it all the time
with a family minivan --

18:16.363 --> 18:17.397
you know,
you ride it hard,

18:17.430 --> 18:18.598
take it everywhere
with the kids.

18:18.631 --> 18:22.469
It's no wonder
these things break down.

18:22.502 --> 18:24.137
But hey, it's just
a hunk of metal, right?

18:25.805 --> 18:27.674
Right. Uh, I think I left
my purse in the van.

18:27.707 --> 18:28.608
Let me just go get it.

18:28.641 --> 18:29.709
Okay.

18:41.321 --> 18:44.957
I hated to give up the van,
but it was the only real choice.

18:44.991 --> 18:47.694
Well, then why were you so quick
to research new cars?

18:47.727 --> 18:49.596
I was coping.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.664
I was trying to tell myself
it would be okay.

18:51.698 --> 18:53.300
But it's not just the van,
Louis.

18:53.333 --> 18:54.701
Our nest is thinning.

18:54.734 --> 18:58.037
The boys are growing up,
and it's all happening so fast.

18:58.070 --> 19:00.006
And when you squeezed
into that tuxedo --

19:00.039 --> 19:04.277
It totally fit.
...and kept showing me pictures
of us and the van,

19:04.311 --> 19:06.513
it just made it hurt more.

19:06.546 --> 19:08.114
I wasn't expecting
to see it again,

19:08.147 --> 19:09.649
and then I did, and...

19:09.682 --> 19:12.185
I don't know,
I snapped.

19:12.219 --> 19:15.121
Jessica, I had no idea.
I'm so sorry for pushing you.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.490
It's okay
that we grieve differently.

19:17.524 --> 19:20.126
I know you like to immediately
talk everything through,

19:20.159 --> 19:21.294
but that's just not me.

19:21.328 --> 19:23.129
I see that now.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.565
So, how did
you even find me?

19:25.598 --> 19:28.067
A good husband
knows how to stalk his wife.

19:28.100 --> 19:30.303
You followed my path
of destruction, didn't you?

19:30.337 --> 19:33.039
I still don't know
how you missed that stroller.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.012
We finally made it
to Disney World.

19:40.046 --> 19:41.381
What a great day.

19:41.414 --> 19:43.082
Grandma:
The part I liked the most

19:43.115 --> 19:47.554
was I accidentally
joined a different family.

19:47.587 --> 19:48.921
You gotta admit,
Jessica,

19:48.955 --> 19:50.590
today was totally worth
the splurge.

19:50.623 --> 19:53.693
And what a splurge it was.

19:55.962 --> 19:57.564
* Yeah

19:57.597 --> 19:59.699
I can't believe you got Kareem
to throw in a free set of tires

19:59.732 --> 20:01.033
considering
we were negotiating

20:01.067 --> 20:02.769
against a grand theft auto
charge.

20:02.802 --> 20:05.204
I also got him
to throw in these.

20:06.406 --> 20:08.408
One hand up,
one around my lady.

20:08.441 --> 20:11.744
Don't make me regret not going
for the headlight eyelashes.

20:11.778 --> 20:14.747
Today was great,
but not as great

20:14.781 --> 20:16.283
as that sleepover
at Walter's.

20:16.316 --> 20:18.017
Yes,
Walter's was fun.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.252
We slept there overnight

20:19.286 --> 20:22.188
and did not get a speeding
ticket in North Carolina.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.423
Oh, God.

20:23.456 --> 20:26.158
There's so much to teach you
and so little time.
