WEBVTT

00:03.795 --> 00:05.797
(movie playing over speakers)

00:07.799 --> 00:09.334
Wow.
Mmm.

00:09.334 --> 00:10.335
(turns off movie)

00:10.335 --> 00:11.403
All right,
time for bed.

00:11.403 --> 00:13.105
Good night.

00:13.105 --> 00:14.773
Give me a hug.
(sighs)

00:14.773 --> 00:16.308
I love you.

00:17.676 --> 00:19.845
LINA:
Hey, what about me?

00:19.845 --> 00:21.246
<i>Did you see that?</i>

00:21.246 --> 00:22.581
RUSS:
<i>What?</i>

00:22.581 --> 00:24.583
You get a huge hug,
and I get bitch face.

00:24.583 --> 00:26.585
I think that's
her regular face.

00:26.585 --> 00:28.687
Yeah, when she hates
something.

00:28.687 --> 00:30.555
Come on, she doesn't hate you,

00:30.555 --> 00:33.825
and, really, you can't be mad
at her for bitch face.

00:33.825 --> 00:34.860
Why not?

00:34.860 --> 00:36.361
'Cause she got it from you.

00:36.361 --> 00:37.696
What?!

00:37.696 --> 00:39.164
Yeah, sometimes you
make bitch face.

00:39.164 --> 00:40.165
I do not.

00:40.165 --> 00:41.500
Yeah, original bitch face.

00:41.500 --> 00:43.201
See?

00:43.201 --> 00:44.503
There it is.

00:49.207 --> 00:51.143
Hey!

00:51.143 --> 00:52.144
(laughing):
Hi.

00:52.144 --> 00:54.312
Hi.

00:54.312 --> 00:55.647
Um, Harper's
upstairs-- go ahead.

00:55.647 --> 00:57.516
(giggles)
Hey, where's my hug?

00:58.850 --> 00:59.851
(sighs)

00:59.851 --> 01:00.852
Bye, honey.

01:00.852 --> 01:02.621
My God.

01:02.621 --> 01:03.722
This age, right, is just

01:03.722 --> 01:04.723
The worst.
the best.

01:06.191 --> 01:08.126
Whatever.
(laughs)

01:10.162 --> 01:12.164
Um, hey, so listen.

01:12.164 --> 01:16.501
Uh, Ella's been having
a tough time with sleepovers.

01:16.501 --> 01:18.437
Crazy anxiety.

01:18.437 --> 01:20.439
She told me-- we've been, like,
texting about it all day.

01:22.140 --> 01:23.542
You guys text?

01:23.542 --> 01:25.377
Yeah, all the time.

01:25.377 --> 01:26.745
Oh.

01:26.745 --> 01:28.747
Hey, hey.

01:28.747 --> 01:30.615
Look, I don't want you to
worry about Ella, okay?

01:30.615 --> 01:31.817
She's gonna be fine.

01:31.817 --> 01:34.319
Okay, thank you.

01:36.154 --> 01:38.490
RUSS:
<i>What about this one?</i>

01:38.490 --> 01:40.492
That one's too funeral.

01:40.492 --> 01:42.461
Come on, that's an
impressive look.

01:42.461 --> 01:43.795
Thanks.
Thank you, George.

01:43.795 --> 01:45.831
Sorry.

01:45.831 --> 01:48.834
(huffs) I don't see
why I need to impress anyone.

01:48.834 --> 01:51.837
Dude, it's your first day
back since you went to rehab.

01:51.837 --> 01:53.839
At my firm.

01:53.839 --> 01:55.741
Marcus and the other
partners should be
Ugh.

01:55.741 --> 01:57.275
trying to impress me.

01:57.275 --> 01:58.577
Oh, my God, what
did we talk about?

01:58.577 --> 02:02.147
Ugh, I'm so sick
of this apology tour.

02:02.147 --> 02:04.216
I know, but look-- it's
almost over, right?

02:04.216 --> 02:06.618
Okay? Just make
peace with Marcus,

02:06.618 --> 02:08.620
and then you just
get back to work.

02:10.155 --> 02:12.157
You're right.

02:12.157 --> 02:15.761
I just need to focus on the
positives in my life right now.

02:15.761 --> 02:17.295
Yeah.

02:17.295 --> 02:18.296
Like Abby.

02:18.296 --> 02:20.165
Totally.

02:20.165 --> 02:22.167
She might be the one.

02:22.167 --> 02:23.535
To marry?

02:23.535 --> 02:25.403
No.

02:25.403 --> 02:27.539
The one to break
my celibacy with.

02:27.539 --> 02:30.242
Are you still not doing it?

02:30.242 --> 02:32.778
There are a lot of ways
to do it without doing it.

02:32.778 --> 02:34.179
The butt.

02:34.179 --> 02:35.380
Come on, man.

02:35.380 --> 02:37.516
Respect my celibacy.
Sorry.

02:37.516 --> 02:39.251
I honestly thought
anal was okay.

02:39.251 --> 02:40.252
Oh, look at this.

02:40.252 --> 02:41.586
This looks great.

02:41.586 --> 02:44.122
This is it, huh?

02:44.122 --> 02:45.457
Yeah, this is it.
Okay.

02:45.457 --> 02:46.792
Here, hold that.

02:51.163 --> 02:52.831
RUSS:
Yeah, I like that one.

02:55.634 --> 02:58.170
Marcus, I'm <i>so</i> sorry

02:58.170 --> 03:00.705
I made you <i>so</i> rich.

03:02.741 --> 03:04.709
Do you want to go
back to work or not?

03:06.378 --> 03:08.213
I just want to be
normal again.

03:08.213 --> 03:09.414
That's it.

03:18.490 --> 03:19.825
Marcus is ready
to see you.

03:26.264 --> 03:28.266
Dennis, Dennis.

03:28.266 --> 03:30.268
Is this suit weird?

03:35.173 --> 03:36.508
Will you just
come to bed?

03:36.508 --> 03:38.410
Uh-uh, the second I
put my pajamas on,

03:38.410 --> 03:39.744
she's gonna call and make
one of us pick her up.

03:39.744 --> 03:41.112
I know it.
(scoffs)

03:41.112 --> 03:42.113
Why haven't we
heard from her?

03:42.113 --> 03:43.548
Because she's fine.

03:43.548 --> 03:44.883
She might be dead.

03:44.883 --> 03:46.418
Just take off
your clothes already.

03:46.418 --> 03:48.353
No, it's bad luck.

03:48.353 --> 03:50.388
(sighs)

03:50.388 --> 03:51.723
Did she text you?

03:51.723 --> 03:53.258
No.

03:53.258 --> 03:54.559
Nothing.

03:54.559 --> 03:56.561
Nothing from AJ either.

03:56.561 --> 03:58.663
God, I hope he didn't do
something stupid.

03:58.663 --> 04:00.131
He is a grown man.

04:00.131 --> 04:01.266
You don't have to
take care of him.

04:01.266 --> 04:03.668
You're not his dad.
I know.

04:03.668 --> 04:06.137
Although with him...
he might actually be dead.

04:06.137 --> 04:07.339
Exactly.

04:07.339 --> 04:09.307
In spectacular fashion.

04:10.675 --> 04:13.178
I'm gonna check my e-mail.

04:24.322 --> 04:26.324
AJ, open up!

04:26.324 --> 04:28.293
AJ:
Go away, man.

04:28.293 --> 04:29.294
Come on!

04:29.294 --> 04:31.329
I got Krispy Kremes!

04:36.268 --> 04:38.803
Jesus.

04:38.803 --> 04:40.805
What happened?

04:42.340 --> 04:43.775
I had it taken in.

04:48.346 --> 04:49.614
Thank you.

04:49.614 --> 04:51.883
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

04:53.785 --> 04:55.320
Shh.

04:55.320 --> 04:56.655
They're all
still sleeping.

04:56.655 --> 04:58.523
Oh, really? How'd she do?
Go on.

04:58.523 --> 05:01.293
Oh, she did great.

05:01.293 --> 05:03.361
Come on in.

05:03.361 --> 05:05.864
I'm so happy she made it
through the night.
I know, right?

05:05.864 --> 05:08.833
I don't know what you did
to make her so comfortable.

05:08.833 --> 05:10.835
I didn't do
anything, really.

05:10.835 --> 05:13.672
We just, you know, stayed
up and talked and had fun.

05:13.672 --> 05:14.873
Yeah.

05:14.873 --> 05:17.375
Yes.

05:17.375 --> 05:18.877
Yeah.

05:18.877 --> 05:21.546
So you stayed up
with them.

05:21.546 --> 05:22.881
Yeah, it's
a sleepover.

05:22.881 --> 05:24.883
I love sleepovers.
Don't you?

05:24.883 --> 05:29.421
Well, we don't really,
um, have any yet,

05:29.421 --> 05:32.357
'cause Ella's so embarrassed
about everything.

05:32.357 --> 05:33.692
I know.

05:33.692 --> 05:35.193
Every time I try to talk
to her about Trevor,

05:35.193 --> 05:37.195
she totally clams up.

05:37.195 --> 05:38.396
Who?

05:38.396 --> 05:40.765
The boy that she's
been texting.

05:40.765 --> 05:44.636
She never said anything
to me about a boy.

05:44.636 --> 05:46.171
Sleepovers.

05:46.171 --> 05:47.372
That's how you
get the intel.

05:49.407 --> 05:50.875
Trevor?

05:50.875 --> 05:52.277
Yeah.

05:52.277 --> 05:53.478
God.

06:04.389 --> 06:07.359
LINA:
Oh, good, you're home.

06:07.359 --> 06:10.295
Hey, can you go pick up
the cupcakes for me, please?

06:10.295 --> 06:13.264
Uh... what cupcakes?

06:13.264 --> 06:14.599
For Ella
and her friends.

06:14.599 --> 06:16.134
We're having a sleepover.

06:16.134 --> 06:17.402
It's gonna be a fun night.

06:17.402 --> 06:19.537
We?
Well, you know,
probably...

06:19.537 --> 06:22.407
play some games, stay up late,

06:22.407 --> 06:25.377
gossip about boys, find out
what's up with Trevor.

06:25.377 --> 06:27.145
Who is Trevor?

06:27.145 --> 06:28.880
The guy she's been texting.
How do you not know this?

06:28.880 --> 06:31.416
So the cupcakes?

06:31.416 --> 06:33.284
Uh, I can't.

06:33.284 --> 06:34.619
Why not?

06:34.619 --> 06:37.455
'Cause AJ got pushed
out of his firm.

06:37.455 --> 06:38.823
Ooh, shit.

06:38.823 --> 06:40.658
I know. I'm kind of
worried about him,

06:40.658 --> 06:42.761
so the guys and I are
gonna take him out.

06:42.761 --> 06:45.163
Well, shouldn't he
call his sponsor?

06:45.163 --> 06:47.332
I think he's in
between sponsors.

06:47.332 --> 06:49.634
Wait, he didn't fire
another one, did he?

06:49.634 --> 06:52.871
(sighs) I don't know, I
think this one was mutual.

06:52.871 --> 06:55.473
Okay, I will get my cupcakes.

06:55.473 --> 06:56.541
For <i>your</i> sleepover?

06:56.541 --> 06:58.309
Yeah,
for my sleepover.

06:58.309 --> 06:59.644
For Ella.

06:59.644 --> 07:01.179
Oh.

07:01.179 --> 07:03.281
There's that face again.

07:10.905 --> 07:12.540
<i>(girls giggling,</i>
<i>dance music pulsing)</i>

07:14.542 --> 07:15.543
Hello?

07:15.543 --> 07:16.844
Pizza guy's here.

07:16.844 --> 07:19.614
Just kidding, it's your mom.

07:19.614 --> 07:21.482
Don't be weird.

07:21.482 --> 07:23.518
Is it weird to ask for a tip?

07:23.518 --> 07:25.853
(girls talking indistinctly,
laughing)

07:38.733 --> 07:41.269
Mmm.

07:44.939 --> 07:47.441

laughing)

07:52.947 --> 07:55.416
SHEPARD:
<i>All right, uh,</i>
<i>so what are we celebrating?</i>

07:55.416 --> 07:56.751
(AJ chuckles)

07:56.751 --> 07:58.452
RUSS:
Celebrating AJ's new life.

07:58.452 --> 08:00.488
He's exploring
new career opportunities.

08:00.488 --> 08:01.656
Stop trying
to spin it, man.

08:01.656 --> 08:03.925
I was canned.

08:03.925 --> 08:06.894
All right, then the
occasion is: you're sad?

08:06.894 --> 08:09.830
I'm not sad, I'm vengeful--
Marcus has to pay.

08:09.830 --> 08:11.265
All right, let's talk
about something more positive.

08:11.265 --> 08:12.767
BERNIE:
I have something positive.

08:12.767 --> 08:15.770
I want to thank Russ for hooking
me up with a new gig.

08:15.770 --> 08:17.638
We're working together again.
RUSS: That's right.

08:17.638 --> 08:19.607
Back in business.
SHEPARD: Cheers.

08:19.607 --> 08:21.475
Yippee, let's hear it
for employment.

08:21.475 --> 08:23.477
Let me tell you something
about getting fired.

08:23.477 --> 08:27.548
It sucks now, but I'm telling
you, in a couple of weeks,

08:27.548 --> 08:29.417
it gets worse and,
like, really bad

08:29.417 --> 08:30.885
for, like, a couple of weeks,

08:30.885 --> 08:33.888
but months from now you're
gonna feel fantastic.

08:33.888 --> 08:35.756
I've never been happier.
AJ (chuckling): Oh, yeah.

08:35.756 --> 08:37.825
Jess said you never
recovered.

08:37.825 --> 08:38.826
Jess never recovered.

08:38.826 --> 08:40.228
I've never been happier.

08:40.228 --> 08:41.229
Whatever.

08:41.229 --> 08:42.363
Tonight is about me.

08:42.363 --> 08:44.665
Tonight. Yeah, right.

08:44.665 --> 08:46.434
<i>(girls talk indistinctly,</i>
<i>muffled pop music plays)</i>

Hi. Um, I got
your text.

09:00.781 --> 09:02.316
Uh, so here's eye shadow,
lip gloss, the works.

09:02.316 --> 09:03.317
Cool.

09:03.317 --> 09:04.652
Yeah.

09:04.652 --> 09:06.754
Uh, so what are you
gonna use it for?

09:06.754 --> 09:08.289
We're doing a
photo shoot.

09:08.289 --> 09:10.291
(gasps)
Really? That's fun.

09:10.291 --> 09:11.959
Do you need help?
I-I can do a smoky eye.

09:11.959 --> 09:13.661
No, I think
we're good.

09:13.661 --> 09:14.929
HARPER: Can we look
in your closet?

09:14.929 --> 09:16.797
My closet?

09:16.797 --> 09:18.933
That's cool.

09:18.933 --> 09:21.502
That's cool.

09:21.502 --> 09:22.903
No, that one's
off-limits.

09:22.903 --> 09:25.406

09:25.406 --> 09:27.742
Cool jacket.

09:29.210 --> 09:30.211
Uh, it's off-limits.

09:30.211 --> 09:31.245
There's no way.

09:31.245 --> 09:32.246
Ella, come on.

09:32.246 --> 09:34.248
It's okay.

09:34.248 --> 09:35.516
You know, just be careful.

09:35.516 --> 09:36.751
Really?
LINA: Yeah.

09:36.751 --> 09:37.752
Totally.

09:37.752 --> 09:38.886
It's all good.

09:38.886 --> 09:40.621
Awesome.

09:42.323 --> 09:45.192
It took me ten years
to build that company

09:45.192 --> 09:48.629
and six months for my partner
to take it all away.

09:48.629 --> 09:52.266
Marcus said, "Oh, hey,
uh, don't worry.

09:52.266 --> 09:53.834
"Take as much time
as you need, friend.

09:53.834 --> 09:55.770
Get better, friend."

09:55.770 --> 09:58.773
And then he took that time
to plot his coup.

09:58.773 --> 10:01.575
Hey, you want me to introduce
him to these guys?

10:01.575 --> 10:03.511
That's not helping.
No, you know what
I'd like you to do?

10:03.511 --> 10:05.379
I'd like you
to cut his dick off

10:05.379 --> 10:06.781
is what I would really
like you to do.

10:06.781 --> 10:08.683
I would just like you
to unzip his pants,

10:08.683 --> 10:11.185
take out his dick
and chop it off

10:11.185 --> 10:12.320
and throw it
in a Dumpster.

10:12.320 --> 10:13.554
That's...
MAN: Hey! Hey, man.

10:13.554 --> 10:15.589
Kind of being
a little loud here.

10:17.391 --> 10:18.959
AJ:
Oh, yeah?

10:18.959 --> 10:20.628
You're being kind of loud!

10:20.628 --> 10:21.696
Come on, man, all right?

10:21.696 --> 10:22.897
You don't have to be like that.

10:22.897 --> 10:23.898
It's my girlfriend's birthday.

10:25.900 --> 10:27.735
Oh.

10:27.735 --> 10:30.404
I'm sorry.
That's not cool.

10:30.404 --> 10:31.639
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

10:31.639 --> 10:32.907
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I-I...

10:32.907 --> 10:34.275
I'm going through something.

10:34.275 --> 10:35.543
SHEPARD:
Hey, you know, the-the touching?

10:35.543 --> 10:37.678
The touching seems wrong.

10:37.678 --> 10:38.946
Can I buy you a drink?
Let me buy you a round.

10:38.946 --> 10:40.448
How do I make this right?

10:40.448 --> 10:41.949
We're good.
Please!

10:41.949 --> 10:43.884
How do I ma... Oh!
We're good, man.

10:43.884 --> 10:46.287
You see?

10:46.287 --> 10:48.756
Marcus ruined
that poor girl's birthday.

10:48.756 --> 10:50.791
That's what
I'm talking about here.

10:50.791 --> 10:52.526
You know what?
Let-let's go somewhere else.

10:52.526 --> 10:54.295
Come on, somewhere fun.

10:54.295 --> 10:55.696
What's fun?
Where's fun?

10:55.696 --> 10:56.731
Fire Island.

10:56.731 --> 10:57.898
Barstow.

10:57.898 --> 10:59.834
Wichita's a cool town actually.

11:01.502 --> 11:03.671
Koreatown.

11:03.671 --> 11:05.773
Hmm.
Koreatown's fun.

11:05.773 --> 11:06.874
Great.

11:06.874 --> 11:08.275
(Shepard stammers)

11:08.275 --> 11:09.410
I'm out.

11:10.578 --> 11:12.680
I don't leave the Valley.

11:12.680 --> 11:14.648
You know that.

11:14.648 --> 11:15.950
HARPER:
<i>So, here's why Lily is lying.</i>

11:15.950 --> 11:17.618
<i>Cooper told Lily</i>

11:17.618 --> 11:19.920
that you were texting with
Trevor and she was like, "Oh."

11:19.920 --> 11:22.423
But what she didn't
tell Cooper is that

11:22.423 --> 11:23.858
she was already texting
Trevor or was she?

11:23.858 --> 11:25.292
ELLA:
Uh, she wasn't!

11:25.292 --> 11:26.627
She totally
didn't start texting him

11:26.627 --> 11:28.429
until she found out
that I want to text Trevor.

11:28.429 --> 11:29.697
So, if Trevor
was texting her,

11:29.697 --> 11:30.931
it was only replying to her text

11:30.931 --> 11:32.366
and not because
he texted her first.

11:32.366 --> 11:33.601
LINA:
Wait.

11:33.601 --> 11:35.569
Who texted who first?
I did.

11:35.569 --> 11:37.271
Lily knew I liked him.

11:37.271 --> 11:38.906
Slut.

11:38.906 --> 11:40.641
Total slut!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:40.641 --> 11:42.610
Don't talk about
each other like that.

11:42.610 --> 11:43.677
Slut shaming?

11:43.677 --> 11:45.346
No.

11:45.346 --> 11:46.614
Feminism yes!

11:46.614 --> 11:48.249
You know, lean in.

11:49.617 --> 11:51.852
We're a sisterhood here.

11:51.852 --> 11:53.788
I have an idea.

11:53.788 --> 11:56.490
But I probably
shouldn't say anything.

11:56.490 --> 11:57.691
Well, what is it?

11:57.691 --> 11:58.826
Ready for this?

11:58.826 --> 12:00.461
TP Lily's house!

12:00.461 --> 12:01.495
LINA: No.

12:01.495 --> 12:02.863
Yes!
No, no. Whoa!

12:02.863 --> 12:04.432
We're not gonna
TP anyone's house.

12:04.432 --> 12:06.434
That's... I have
a better idea.

12:06.434 --> 12:09.670
What about mani-pedis?

12:09.670 --> 12:12.406
Mm, no, thanks.

12:12.406 --> 12:14.542
I knew my mom
wouldn't go for it.

12:14.542 --> 12:16.377
She's not like that.

12:16.377 --> 12:18.813
Guys want
to watch a movie?

12:18.813 --> 12:21.682
Um... you know, guys,

12:21.682 --> 12:24.652
I just was thinking about, um,
what you were saying,

12:24.652 --> 12:27.521
and I realized that

12:27.521 --> 12:29.857
if you're serious about
getting your point across...

12:32.526 --> 12:35.796
...there's better ways than TP.

12:35.796 --> 12:37.832
(girls gasp, chuckle)
Yeah.

(crowd cheering)

13:32.386 --> 13:34.321
MAN:
Thank you, Bernie.

13:34.321 --> 13:35.689
We're gonna take a little break,

13:35.689 --> 13:37.358
and we'll be back
with more karaoke.

13:37.358 --> 13:38.859
RUSS:
Wow. All right.

13:38.859 --> 13:40.261
What can I get you here?

13:40.261 --> 13:41.762
They got a Faux-hito,

13:41.762 --> 13:43.330
Mocktini

13:43.330 --> 13:44.698
or Abstinence
on the Beach.

13:44.698 --> 13:45.799
One of each, whatever.

13:45.799 --> 13:47.468
What are you guys singing?

13:47.468 --> 13:48.802
You want to join me
in a Shinyee Jonghyun duet?

13:48.802 --> 13:50.638
(scoffs)

13:50.638 --> 13:53.240
What? It's the Glen Campbell
of Korea.

13:53.240 --> 13:54.808
Whatever.
You know what? I'll pick.

13:54.808 --> 13:56.410
What is your deal, dude?
Come on.

13:56.410 --> 13:58.245
You were the one
that suggested karaoke.

13:58.245 --> 13:59.880
I'm not here for music.
I'm here for her.

13:59.880 --> 14:02.283
BERNIE:
Oh, a waitress.

14:02.283 --> 14:03.584
AJ: No.

14:03.584 --> 14:04.818
Mistress;
Marcus's mistress.

14:04.818 --> 14:06.754
Or girlfriend,
whatever she is.

14:06.754 --> 14:09.723
He takes from me,
I take from him.

14:09.723 --> 14:11.392
What does that mean?

14:11.392 --> 14:13.360
It means I'm going to take
all the rage

14:13.360 --> 14:15.729
I'm feeling towards Marcus
and channel it

14:15.729 --> 14:17.932
into making that lady come.

14:17.932 --> 14:21.502
C-U-M.

14:21.502 --> 14:22.903
Ah, the gentle art of seduction.

14:22.903 --> 14:24.371
Mm-hmm.

14:24.371 --> 14:26.907
Okay, let's assume
for a terrible second

14:26.907 --> 14:28.576
that you do seduce her...

14:28.576 --> 14:29.777
Oh, I'm gonna seduce her.

14:29.777 --> 14:30.878
What about Abby?

14:30.878 --> 14:32.479
Abby?
Yeah.

14:32.479 --> 14:34.381
Abby...

14:34.381 --> 14:35.749
I'll worry about Abby tomorrow.

14:35.749 --> 14:37.284
Tonight we ride.

14:37.284 --> 14:38.352
Come on.

14:38.352 --> 14:39.920
AJ... this is stupid.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.422
You're better than this.

14:41.422 --> 14:43.791
We both know
that that's not true.

14:44.925 --> 14:46.727
BERNIE:
Good luck.

14:46.727 --> 14:48.729
Don't need it.
I know.

14:56.937 --> 14:58.906
That was fast.

14:58.906 --> 15:01.508
How does he do it?

15:01.508 --> 15:03.711
(sighs)

15:03.711 --> 15:05.446
Yeah?
It's on.

15:05.446 --> 15:07.348
(chuckles)
You know what?

15:07.348 --> 15:08.549
I think I am gonna sing.

15:08.549 --> 15:10.517
Yes!

15:10.517 --> 15:11.619
Good idea.

15:11.619 --> 15:14.555
Oh!

15:14.555 --> 15:15.689
Hello.

15:15.689 --> 15:17.257
So, you and AJ, huh?

15:17.257 --> 15:19.393
You need to call
the police.

15:19.393 --> 15:21.261
The <i>Gyung Chal--</i> why?

15:21.261 --> 15:23.530
Your friend said
that he would kill himself if...

15:23.530 --> 15:24.865
if I didn't sleep with him.

15:24.865 --> 15:26.400
What?

15:26.400 --> 15:28.535
No.
Damn.

15:28.535 --> 15:31.538
He got game.

15:31.538 --> 15:33.474
AJ:
This song goes out

15:33.474 --> 15:36.510
to your waitress tonight, Grace,

15:36.510 --> 15:38.646
who is also the woman

15:38.646 --> 15:40.481
that is about
to save my life.

15:40.481 --> 15:42.549
(groans)

15:42.549 --> 15:45.853
(whispers):
Okay.

15:45.853 --> 15:46.854
(girls shushing)

15:46.854 --> 15:48.422
Wait, wait, wait.

15:48.422 --> 15:50.658
Mom, what are we doing?!
We can't do this.

15:50.658 --> 15:52.660
What do you mean?
You're the one who...

15:52.660 --> 15:53.594
We should go now.

15:53.594 --> 15:55.896
No, this is good for us.

15:55.896 --> 15:58.565
What's going on with you?

15:58.565 --> 16:00.267
What's your problem?

16:00.267 --> 16:01.735
What's <i>your</i> problem?

16:01.735 --> 16:03.737
(girls clamoring)

16:03.737 --> 16:04.638

16:04.638 --> 16:06.206
Uh-oh.

Hey, Mom, you want to
watch a movie with us?

16:28.362 --> 16:29.763
Uh, no, I'm gonna, um, clean up.

16:29.763 --> 16:30.964
Okay.

16:30.964 --> 16:32.766
Thanks for tonight.
It was cool.

16:32.766 --> 16:35.536
Glad you guys had fun.

16:43.510 --> 16:44.845
Excuse me.

16:44.845 --> 16:46.613
Hey, my friend

16:46.613 --> 16:48.549
would like to tell
you something.

16:51.618 --> 16:54.722
Look, when I said that I
was gonna kill myself,

16:54.722 --> 16:56.724
what I really
meant to say was,

16:56.724 --> 16:59.193
"Damn, girl,
you are so fine."

16:59.193 --> 17:00.928
AJ!
Okay, okay.

17:00.928 --> 17:02.796
Okay, I wasn't thinking.

17:02.796 --> 17:05.666
Marcus promised that I would

17:05.666 --> 17:07.468
always be a part of the firm.

17:07.468 --> 17:09.970
And when I found out
that that was all a lie,

17:09.970 --> 17:13.474
I lost it and I wanted
to hurt him so bad.

17:13.474 --> 17:16.910
Grudge-banging you seemed...

17:16.910 --> 17:18.679
logical.
(chuckles)

17:18.679 --> 17:20.581
But now I realize

17:20.581 --> 17:21.615
it wasn't a good plan.

17:21.615 --> 17:23.584
Hindsight is 20/20.

17:23.584 --> 17:24.752
Yes. So, good night.
We are leaving.

17:24.752 --> 17:26.453
We will never bother you again.

17:26.453 --> 17:27.588
Good night. Oh!

17:27.588 --> 17:29.490
(speaking Korean)
Come on.

17:29.490 --> 17:30.524
Stop that.
Come on.

17:30.524 --> 17:31.525
Hey.

17:34.695 --> 17:37.331
Marcus made me
a lot of promises, too.

17:37.331 --> 17:40.467
Said he'd leave his wife,
get a dog,

17:40.467 --> 17:42.636
pay for my eyelid surgery.

17:42.636 --> 17:44.505
Can I tell you something?

17:44.505 --> 17:48.175
Sure.

17:48.175 --> 17:51.445
I think your eyelids
are perfect.

17:53.347 --> 17:55.649

That's right.

18:06.460 --> 18:08.262
Forget it, Russ.

18:08.262 --> 18:10.597
It's Koreatown.

18:21.475 --> 18:23.277
Hi!
Shh!

18:23.277 --> 18:25.179
They're still sleeping.
Oh, okay.

18:25.179 --> 18:27.347
How was the big sleepover?

18:27.347 --> 18:29.349
Did you guys get crazy?

18:29.349 --> 18:31.318
Um, I think...

18:31.318 --> 18:33.554
Yeah, a little too crazy.

18:33.554 --> 18:36.924
It, um...
Oh, never mind.

18:36.924 --> 18:38.959
Okay. Well, I guess
if they're still sleeping,

18:38.959 --> 18:41.228
I'll-I'll drop
this off at Lily's

18:41.228 --> 18:43.463
and then I'll
come back, so, um,

18:43.463 --> 18:46.567
you know what's going on, right?

18:46.567 --> 18:48.735
Uh, the texting

18:48.735 --> 18:50.938
and-and Trevor and the-the...

18:50.938 --> 18:52.439
Uh, no, no.

18:52.439 --> 18:54.741
Lily's mom is going
through chemo.

18:54.741 --> 18:58.912
You want to sign up

Yeah, yeah.
