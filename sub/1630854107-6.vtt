WEBVTT

00:10.662 --> 00:12.099
Stay out of your head.

00:13.100 --> 00:15.537
Stay in the moment.
You know what to do.

00:21.804 --> 00:23.110
But you didn't do it.

00:23.110 --> 00:24.633
And now you're
on the mat.

00:24.633 --> 00:25.938
Want to tell me why?

00:25.938 --> 00:28.289
Because I was in my head?

00:28.289 --> 00:29.681
Yes, you were.

00:31.901 --> 00:34.512
Full disclosure, it's
my favorite place to be.

00:34.512 --> 00:36.993
Your technique is solid.

00:36.993 --> 00:38.560
Your dedication,

00:38.560 --> 00:40.518
- unquestionable.
- But I hesitated.

00:40.518 --> 00:43.173
Kasie, you're full of spirit,

00:43.173 --> 00:45.045
but you lack self-confidence.

00:45.045 --> 00:49.179
Is my joyous spirit
enough to allow me to belt up?

00:49.179 --> 00:51.094
Not until you get out of here

00:51.094 --> 00:52.748
and trust here.

00:52.748 --> 00:54.532
Oh, my stomach?

00:54.532 --> 00:55.707
Your gut.

00:55.707 --> 00:58.058
Trust your instincts.

00:58.058 --> 01:01.322
"She who hesitates is lost."

01:02.584 --> 01:03.846
Okay.

01:07.632 --> 01:09.547
Elbows down.

01:09.547 --> 01:11.158
Hands up.

01:11.158 --> 01:12.768
Come on, Kasie.

01:12.768 --> 01:14.074
Defend.

01:16.380 --> 01:17.903
I see her.

01:17.903 --> 01:19.688
Don't worry.
It'll be quick.

01:21.907 --> 01:25.041
Okay.

01:25.041 --> 01:27.217
Arm down.
Now pull!

01:27.217 --> 01:28.871
Watch the leg. Kasie.

01:28.871 --> 01:30.002
Watch the leg.

01:30.002 --> 01:31.265
Hey, move. Kasie.

01:31.265 --> 01:32.831
Move!

02:03.297 --> 02:05.125
All right, let's try this again.

02:13.568 --> 02:14.917
You know at some point,

02:14.917 --> 02:16.266
we are gonna have
to stage an intervention.

02:16.266 --> 02:17.876
Yeah, I don't think
he can hear us.

02:17.876 --> 02:20.488
Having some tech trouble, McGee?

02:20.488 --> 02:23.230
Yes, everything in the building
is running slow,

02:23.230 --> 02:24.796
and it is driving me crazy.

02:26.755 --> 02:29.105
My computer seems
fine. Torres?

02:29.105 --> 02:30.367
Running like a dream.

02:30.367 --> 02:31.499
Nah, impossible.

02:31.499 --> 02:33.022
It's affecting all my devices.

02:33.022 --> 02:34.415
It's got to be
a network-wide slowdown.

02:34.415 --> 02:35.503
Look at this.

02:37.374 --> 02:39.246
- See that?
- That was slow?

02:39.246 --> 02:40.769
Are you kidding?

02:40.769 --> 02:42.249
It's lagging by at least
a fourth of a second.

02:42.249 --> 02:43.380
Here,

02:43.380 --> 02:44.468
I'll load it again.

02:44.468 --> 02:46.775
Ah, I see
what the problem is.

02:46.775 --> 02:48.516
It's a you thing, McGee.

02:48.516 --> 02:49.821
A what?

02:49.821 --> 02:51.301
You know,
like when something stinks

02:51.301 --> 02:52.824
but you're the only one
that can smell it.

02:52.824 --> 02:55.305
Or it's hot and you're
the only one who's cold.

02:55.305 --> 02:58.047
See, it's like a you thing.
Not an us thing.

02:58.047 --> 03:00.180
Anybody know why the computers
are running slow?

03:00.180 --> 03:02.007
I've been
trying to send

03:02.007 --> 03:03.705
a Bandium alert
and it's taking forever.

03:03.705 --> 03:05.402
You see that?
Not just a me thing.

03:07.404 --> 03:08.405
Finally.

03:09.493 --> 03:11.191
McGEE: Looks like
we have a body, but...

03:11.191 --> 03:13.932
All I'm getting is that
annoying spinning beach ball.

03:13.932 --> 03:16.631
- Yeah. Me too.
- Yeah, it's 'cause
the computers are running slow.

03:16.631 --> 03:18.154
See? It's an us thing now.

03:18.154 --> 03:21.505
Those fourths of a second
add up fast.

03:26.118 --> 03:27.685
This guy must really
love his cat.

03:27.685 --> 03:29.600
Not his cat.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.907
The neighbor said, uh,
this guy didn't live here.

03:31.907 --> 03:35.302
The house is occupied by
a Lieutenant Mary Laredo.

03:35.302 --> 03:36.955
Well, then she must
love her cat.

03:36.955 --> 03:38.566
Prince Charming.

03:38.566 --> 03:40.132
That's his name.

03:40.132 --> 03:42.178
just got off the phone
with Base Operations.

03:42.178 --> 03:45.268
They said Laredo is deployed
to the USS <i>Camden.</i>

03:45.268 --> 03:47.966
Headed towards the Gulf,
currently on radio silence.

03:47.966 --> 03:51.056
So, who is this guy?
He kind of looks familiar.

03:51.056 --> 03:53.015
No idea. They said
Laredo lives alone.

03:53.015 --> 03:55.060
Jimmy, you want to...

03:55.060 --> 03:57.280
oh, yeah, fingerprints.
Right, on it.

03:57.280 --> 04:00.240
He seems pretty beat up.
Like a prizefighter.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.806
Yeah, but this wasn't a beating.

04:01.806 --> 04:03.330
I mean, based on the location

04:03.330 --> 04:04.983
of deep tissue swelling
and the urticaria,

04:04.983 --> 04:06.420
I'd said that we're looking at

04:06.420 --> 04:09.074
an acute
anaphylactic angioedema.

04:09.074 --> 04:10.511
Jimmy?

04:10.511 --> 04:13.688
Uh, it was a deadly
allergic reaction.

04:13.688 --> 04:15.907
Where's an EpiPen
when you need one?

04:15.907 --> 04:17.779
I say we blame the cat.

04:17.779 --> 04:20.172
Well, I won't know the allergen
trigger till I get him back

04:20.172 --> 04:22.784
to autopsy, but I highly
doubt that it was airborne.

04:22.784 --> 04:25.003
Also, based on the amount
of the swelling here,

04:25.003 --> 04:27.354
I doubt that this was
an accident.

04:27.354 --> 04:28.877
Yeah, you're not
kidding about that.

04:28.877 --> 04:30.574
McGEE:
Why, what'd you find?

04:30.574 --> 04:33.403
It's what I didn't find.
Fingerprints. Anywhere.

04:33.403 --> 04:35.144
The house was wiped?

04:35.144 --> 04:37.364
Yeah, seems like somebody
was covering their tracks.

04:37.364 --> 04:40.367
Got something, guys.
Check it out.

04:41.629 --> 04:42.934
There was blood here.

04:42.934 --> 04:45.285
And looks like somebody
tried to clean it.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.461
Not before the cat
walked right through it.

04:47.461 --> 04:49.332
Well, there's
no cuts or abrasions

04:49.332 --> 04:50.594
on our victim here,
so it wasn't his blood.

04:50.594 --> 04:51.900
It must belong to the killer.

04:51.900 --> 04:53.902
Maybe Prince Charming

04:53.902 --> 04:55.904
got a few good gouges in
before he ran...

04:57.775 --> 04:59.690
Jimmy, you okay?

05:00.735 --> 05:02.737
Yeah, the, uh...
fingerprint match

05:02.737 --> 05:05.609
just came back. Guys...

05:05.609 --> 05:07.829
This is Otis Khatri.

05:09.439 --> 05:11.615
NCIS Agent Khatri?

05:11.615 --> 05:12.921
Otis from downstairs?

05:14.444 --> 05:15.880
Afraid so.

05:17.621 --> 05:19.754
Well, with the swelling,
I didn't recognize him.

05:19.754 --> 05:21.059
I never met him.

05:21.059 --> 05:22.496
What, uh, what
can you tell me?

05:22.496 --> 05:24.672
Oh, he was a good man.

05:24.672 --> 05:27.152
Yeah, this is crazy.

05:27.152 --> 05:28.502
Everyone loved Otis.

05:28.502 --> 05:30.808
Yeah, well,
apparently not everyone.

05:33.115 --> 05:34.246
<i>Hey, Kasie.</i>

05:34.246 --> 05:35.552
Sorry I'm late.

05:35.552 --> 05:37.162
Took forever
to get Otis processed.

05:37.162 --> 05:39.251
I think we're all
still in shock.

05:39.251 --> 05:40.862
Uh, Kasie?

05:40.862 --> 05:43.778
Hello?
Hey, look, Kase,

05:43.778 --> 05:45.214
if you're trying
to prank me here,

05:45.214 --> 05:47.129
all right, today is not the day.

05:56.399 --> 05:58.923
Hey, this is Kasie.
I'm not here right now,

05:58.923 --> 06:00.490
but leave a message
and I'll hit you back later.

06:00.490 --> 06:03.798
Kase, I'm in your lab right now.

06:03.798 --> 06:05.452
I even remembered to bring
my controller, you know,

06:05.452 --> 06:06.975
just like we planned.

06:06.975 --> 06:08.455
Only thing missing is you.

06:19.857 --> 06:22.643
Agent Otis Khatri
worked on the contingency

06:22.643 --> 06:24.253
response team.
He oversaw

06:24.253 --> 06:26.951
international humanitarian
support operations.

06:26.951 --> 06:28.431
I know.

06:28.431 --> 06:30.868
I recommended him.

06:30.868 --> 06:32.435
In that job,

06:32.435 --> 06:35.395
you see people
at their lowest,

06:35.395 --> 06:38.615
after natural
disasters, wars.

06:38.615 --> 06:40.748
But Otis was
a natural fixer.

06:40.748 --> 06:42.880
He always knew how to help.

06:42.880 --> 06:45.405
He was a good agent.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.145
I presume you've notified
his next of kin.

06:47.145 --> 06:48.712
His sister is on her way in.

06:48.712 --> 06:50.148
But she did tell us why

06:50.148 --> 06:51.933
Otis was at
Lieutenant Laredo's house.

06:51.933 --> 06:53.456
Cat-sitting.

06:53.456 --> 06:56.677
Turns out our best lead
is that runaway cat.

06:56.677 --> 06:58.461
Well, courts generally prefer

06:58.461 --> 07:00.289
to have their
witnesses be human.

07:00.289 --> 07:03.031
Well, we have reason to believe
that Prince Charming

07:03.031 --> 07:05.512
may have the killer's DNA
on his paws.

07:05.512 --> 07:07.470
But you got to find him first.

07:07.470 --> 07:09.820
I once tracked a caribou
in the tundra for 11 miles.

07:09.820 --> 07:11.909
How hard could it be
to find a house cat?

07:13.476 --> 07:15.565
You care to elaborate on why

07:15.565 --> 07:18.394
you were in the tundra
following a caribou?

07:18.394 --> 07:20.483
Oh, how much time
do you have?

07:21.702 --> 07:24.182
But, uh, it'll have to wait.
This is Jimmy.

07:24.182 --> 07:26.358
Sounds like he's got
something urgent.

07:26.358 --> 07:28.883
Good, let's hope something more
promising than a runaway cat.

07:32.103 --> 07:33.801
Jimmy, what's the emergency?

07:33.801 --> 07:35.150
Kasie's missing.

07:35.150 --> 07:37.021
- What?
- Her favorite video game,

07:37.021 --> 07:38.980
<i>Slayers, Spells and Starcraft 4</i>
dropped last night, and

07:38.980 --> 07:41.678
we had planned for a month to
play it at lunch, today's lunch,

07:41.678 --> 07:43.680
- and she never shows up.
- Okay, slow down. She's...

07:43.680 --> 07:45.552
Kasie never flakes
on people, all right?

07:45.552 --> 07:47.075
And she never passes up
an opportunity

07:47.075 --> 07:49.164
to show off her badassery skills
as Kana-Hune.

07:49.164 --> 07:50.774
Kana-who?

07:50.774 --> 07:52.559
Hune. It's, uh, Kasie's
monster-slaying avatar,

07:52.559 --> 07:54.082
it's this Kana-Hune.

07:54.082 --> 07:56.432
Something bad has happened.
I can feel it.

07:56.432 --> 07:57.912
I-I keep calling
her cell phone--

07:57.912 --> 07:59.391
it keeps going
straight to voice mail.

07:59.391 --> 08:02.046
Jimmy, deep breath.
Kasie's fine, okay?

08:02.046 --> 08:04.353
You don't know that.

08:04.353 --> 08:05.789
Actually, I do.

08:05.789 --> 08:08.052
She requested a personal
health day this morning.

08:08.052 --> 08:10.577
But why?
Kasie's perfectly healthy.

08:10.577 --> 08:12.927
Not really our business, is it?

08:12.927 --> 08:15.799
But she would've told me if...
Why-why didn't she tell me?

08:15.799 --> 08:17.888
That is a good question,
but maybe the answer

08:17.888 --> 08:21.326
isn't, uh... you know,
our business either?

08:22.893 --> 08:25.287
You're right.
Yeah, sorry. Uh...

08:25.287 --> 08:28.072
Having Otis on my table here
is making me a bit paranoid.

08:28.072 --> 08:29.726
I get it, I get it.

08:29.726 --> 08:31.511
But, uh, let's just
focus on the case

08:31.511 --> 08:33.556
and keep your
mind busy.

08:33.556 --> 08:35.819
Right, uh, busy mind, good.

08:35.819 --> 08:39.040
Uh, cause of death, as
I suspected, was anaphylaxis.

08:39.040 --> 08:40.694
You figure out from what yet?

08:40.694 --> 08:42.086
Sesame oil.

08:42.086 --> 08:43.523
Which shouldn't
come as a surprise.

08:43.523 --> 08:46.351
Otis's file lists
a serious allergy to...

08:46.351 --> 08:48.266
sesame.

08:48.266 --> 08:51.095
He obviously wasn't
- careful about what he ate.
- No, no, no.

08:51.095 --> 08:53.010
His bestie down
in the motor pool said that

08:53.010 --> 08:55.317
Otis was constantly
checking ingredient labels.

08:55.317 --> 08:56.840
Maybe he missed one.

08:56.840 --> 08:59.887
Uh, even so, the levels
that were in his blood--

08:59.887 --> 09:01.192
this couldn't
have been an accident.

09:01.192 --> 09:03.325
So either it was

09:03.325 --> 09:05.066
a deliberate suicide or...

09:05.066 --> 09:06.502
Someone dosed him.

09:08.069 --> 09:12.029
The same someone who wiped down
every print in Laredo's house.

09:12.029 --> 09:13.553
Whoever it was,

09:13.553 --> 09:16.251
I can't imagine Otis
just eating something

09:16.251 --> 09:18.035
without asking
what was in it first.

09:18.035 --> 09:19.820
It's called lying, Jimmy.

09:19.820 --> 09:23.127
Yeah, but for him to trust
whoever gave it to him,

09:23.127 --> 09:24.389
that means...

09:24.389 --> 09:26.261
Otis probably knew his killer.

09:27.654 --> 09:29.438
I just don't get it.

09:29.438 --> 09:32.049
Why would someone want
to kill my brother?

09:32.049 --> 09:34.008
Well, we're, uh,
we're hoping

09:34.008 --> 09:35.662
that you can help us
figure that out.

09:35.662 --> 09:38.012
Can you tell us anything
about his life

09:38.012 --> 09:39.187
outside of work?

09:39.187 --> 09:42.494
His work was his life.

09:42.494 --> 09:46.107
Otis was so proud
to be part of NCIS.

09:46.107 --> 09:50.546
He joked that he was
a modern-day superhero.

09:50.546 --> 09:54.419
Didn't need a cape or wings,
because he had a computer.

09:54.419 --> 09:57.248
Mm. Laptop is mightier
than the sword.

09:58.249 --> 10:00.077
You must be McGeek.

10:01.078 --> 10:03.646
Haven't heard
that one in a while.

10:03.646 --> 10:05.648
Yeah, maybe we should
bring that back.

10:05.648 --> 10:07.041
Oh, I-I'm sorry.

10:07.041 --> 10:09.652
I think Otis meant it
as a compliment.

10:09.652 --> 10:11.959
- He only used it with me.
- Yeah.

10:11.959 --> 10:14.091
Were you and your brother close?

10:14.091 --> 10:16.267
Very.

10:16.267 --> 10:19.096
E-Even though his work
was classified,

10:19.096 --> 10:20.924
he-he still found ways
to tell me

10:20.924 --> 10:23.013
about all the good he was doing.

10:24.667 --> 10:25.755
But...

10:25.755 --> 10:27.670
But what?

10:27.670 --> 10:31.369
This last week he didn't
want to talk about work.

10:31.369 --> 10:33.850
Did he say why?

10:33.850 --> 10:35.635
Something
wasn't right.

10:35.635 --> 10:39.116
I just thought that
he was overworked.

10:39.116 --> 10:40.770
But now...

10:40.770 --> 10:43.251
Can you give us a list
of people Otis was close to?

10:43.251 --> 10:45.427
Maybe who knew
he was cat-sitting.

10:45.427 --> 10:49.170
Well, like I said,
NCIS was Otis' life.

10:49.170 --> 10:52.303
His co-workers were
his closest friends.

10:52.303 --> 10:54.654
All the people who would have
known he was cat-sitting

10:54.654 --> 10:56.743
are probably in this building.

11:03.445 --> 11:04.751
Hey, Jimmy, what
are you doing here?

11:04.751 --> 11:06.709
Oh, just helping out
while Kasie's gone.

11:06.709 --> 11:08.319
Ooh, you sure
you're up for it?

11:08.319 --> 11:10.800
Because, uh, there's a lot
of buttons in here.

11:10.800 --> 11:13.020
Well, thanks to <i>
Abby's Lab for Dummies,</i>

11:13.020 --> 11:14.891
- piece of cake.
- Okay.

11:14.891 --> 11:16.458
Parker said there was an update.

11:16.458 --> 11:18.286
Yeah. I was able
to pull a clue

11:18.286 --> 11:20.375
off of Otis' laptop.

11:22.116 --> 11:23.508
I hope you like cake.

11:26.337 --> 11:29.558
Oh, let's see.
Uh, that should have worked.

11:29.558 --> 11:31.342
Okay, I... okay, I see.
I see what I did wrong here.

11:31.342 --> 11:32.996
I guess I should
have pressed

11:32.996 --> 11:35.172
this button.

11:35.172 --> 11:37.479
Okay, Jimmy,
less beeping and more cake.

11:37.479 --> 11:39.742
That's an entirely new sound
I've never heard before.

11:39.742 --> 11:41.526
- Okay, I'll come back.
- Okay, no, no, no, wait.

11:41.526 --> 11:43.311
Hold on, hold on.
I-I've got it, I've got it.

11:43.311 --> 11:45.792
Okay, uh, I wasn't able
to get into Otis'

11:45.792 --> 11:48.838
user account here,
but I did pull a partial print

11:48.838 --> 11:51.319
off the battery flap that
the killer forgot to wipe.

11:51.319 --> 11:52.407
Okay, you've got
my attention back.

11:52.407 --> 11:55.062
So I enlarged the fingerprint.

11:55.062 --> 11:56.846
Want to make sure
I got a good image

11:56.846 --> 11:59.849
before I put it into AFIS.

12:00.807 --> 12:03.723
Like so.

12:06.769 --> 12:09.424
Kasie makes this look
so much easier than it is.

12:09.424 --> 12:10.904
All right, Jimmy,

12:10.904 --> 12:12.557
do you know what
- you're doing here?
- Aah!

12:12.557 --> 12:13.515
There was a time
when I did, Nick.

12:13.515 --> 12:15.647
That time is now gone.

12:15.647 --> 12:18.346
- What's going on?
- I didn't touch anything. Nothing.

12:18.346 --> 12:20.000
What did you do
to my babies?

12:20.000 --> 12:23.133
Yeah, your babies don't like
Jimmy. He makes them cry.

12:27.224 --> 12:28.835
I'm so glad you're back.

12:28.835 --> 12:30.271
Okay.

12:30.271 --> 12:32.316
Um, what are you
doing in my lab?

12:32.316 --> 12:33.665
All right, that's
my cue to leave.

12:33.665 --> 12:35.232
If you guys get a hit
on those prints,

12:35.232 --> 12:36.668
just give me a call.

12:36.668 --> 12:39.062
Wait, prints? Whose prints?

12:39.062 --> 12:41.369
- The killer's.
- Oh, right, yeah.

12:41.369 --> 12:42.587
Duh. My bad.

12:42.587 --> 12:45.634
And, uh, who's the victim?

12:45.634 --> 12:48.245
Oh, Kase, you haven't heard?
It was Otis.

12:48.245 --> 12:51.988
Otis? As in NCIS Otis?

12:51.988 --> 12:53.816
He was murdered? When?

12:53.816 --> 12:55.339
It was yesterday.

12:55.339 --> 12:57.385
I mean, then entire
crime scene was wiped clean.

12:57.385 --> 12:59.604
But I did manage
to pull a partial print

12:59.604 --> 13:01.519
from inside of his laptop.

13:01.519 --> 13:03.826
That's what I was running
when you came in and I...

13:03.826 --> 13:05.306
Oh. That was fast.

13:05.306 --> 13:06.960
Print must already
be in the system.

13:06.960 --> 13:09.266
Oh, you know what,
I-I got it from here, Jimmy.

13:09.266 --> 13:10.572
Um, thank you so much
for your help...

13:15.055 --> 13:17.187
This isn't what
it looks like.

13:17.187 --> 13:20.756
Good. Because what it
looks like is that

13:20.756 --> 13:23.803
your fingerprints are on
our murder victim's laptop.

13:32.507 --> 13:34.901
Kasie, seriously, we don't
need to question you

13:34.901 --> 13:36.424
in Interrogation.

13:36.424 --> 13:37.773
I think you should.

13:37.773 --> 13:39.514
Just tell us why
your fingerprints were

13:39.514 --> 13:40.863
on Otis' laptop.

13:40.863 --> 13:42.952
Respectfully, if this
was anyone else,

13:42.952 --> 13:44.736
you would bring them
into Interrogation

13:44.736 --> 13:45.912
as a murder suspect.

13:45.912 --> 13:47.261
- Did you kill Otis?
- Of course not.

13:47.261 --> 13:48.740
Then why aren't you
telling us

13:48.740 --> 13:50.090
why your fingerprints... I will.

13:50.090 --> 13:51.787
In Interrogation.

13:51.787 --> 13:54.572
Please, we need to
stick to the rule.

13:54.572 --> 13:57.271
For Otis
and for me.

13:57.271 --> 13:59.490
And for you.

14:04.321 --> 14:06.889
Oh, uh, Kase, that's where
we usually sit.

14:06.889 --> 14:08.456
Oh, we can switch places later.

14:08.456 --> 14:10.806
I'll be happy to answer
all of your questions

14:10.806 --> 14:13.287
after you answer
a few of mine.

14:16.725 --> 14:17.769
Okay.

14:17.769 --> 14:19.554
Who's

14:19.554 --> 14:21.512
interviewing who here?

14:22.905 --> 14:24.907
And she has a notebook?

14:27.518 --> 14:30.304
Special Agent Timothy McGee,
do you recall receiving

14:30.304 --> 14:33.742
multiple shipments of electronic
equipment from China?

14:33.742 --> 14:35.962
What is happening right now?

14:35.962 --> 14:38.703
Wh-What does this have to do
with Otis' murder?

14:38.703 --> 14:39.922
I will get to that.

14:39.922 --> 14:41.402
A few months back
you received

14:41.402 --> 14:45.275
an IC distributor,
two GL microprocessors,

14:45.275 --> 14:46.886
a temperature-sensing...

14:46.886 --> 14:48.409
Crystal oscillator.

14:48.409 --> 14:49.889
Yeah.
How'd you know all that?

14:49.889 --> 14:51.499
Well, I'm asking
the questions here.

14:51.499 --> 14:52.848
No, actually, we're the ones

14:52.848 --> 14:54.415
that are supposed to
ask the questions.

14:54.415 --> 14:57.374
What are the parts for,
Agent McGee?

14:58.985 --> 15:01.248
I ordered those parts
to restore

15:01.248 --> 15:03.424
an old Beary Smyles.

15:04.991 --> 15:06.340
A Beary who?

15:06.340 --> 15:09.169
It's a talking
electronic bear I wanted

15:09.169 --> 15:10.997
since I was six years old.

15:10.997 --> 15:13.042
I recently found him
at a swap meet.

15:13.042 --> 15:14.478
But he was broken.

15:14.478 --> 15:16.959
Needed a full
electronic overhaul.

15:16.959 --> 15:20.180
Kasie, what... Hold on.

15:20.180 --> 15:24.445
So this list of parts
was to repair a talking bear?

15:24.445 --> 15:26.055
Oh, not just any talking bear.

15:26.055 --> 15:28.928
<i>The</i> talking bear.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.973
Beary Smyles was
the most expressive,

15:30.973 --> 15:32.975
intelligent toy of the '80s.

15:32.975 --> 15:35.891
That'’s why it was a gadget
on my bucket list.

15:35.891 --> 15:37.849
You know, McGee
can be very cute.

15:37.849 --> 15:40.461
Is it me, or do you just
kinda want to hug him right now?

15:42.158 --> 15:45.248
I am officially clearing
Special Agent Timothy McGee,

15:45.248 --> 15:49.122
which in turn
closes cases number BX57,

15:49.122 --> 15:51.385
concluding my investigation,
and clearing the entire

15:51.385 --> 15:53.517
Major Case
Response Team.

15:53.517 --> 15:55.128
Kasie, who are you talking to?

15:55.128 --> 15:56.738
Did you just say that
you were investigating us?

15:56.738 --> 15:59.088
Oh, I was, but now I'm not.

15:59.088 --> 16:01.090
Okay, we can switch places now.

16:01.090 --> 16:02.962
Uh, j... don't bother.

16:02.962 --> 16:06.400
Kasie, uh, what
the hell is going on?

16:08.184 --> 16:09.969
There's a mole at NCIS.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.579
Come again?

16:11.579 --> 16:13.363
Funny story.

16:13.363 --> 16:16.671
I was recruited by DCIS to do
an internal investigation

16:16.671 --> 16:19.500
to find a suspected
mole in NCIS,

16:19.500 --> 16:23.156
which means I've actually
been investigating

16:23.156 --> 16:25.549
all of the teams
that I work with,

16:25.549 --> 16:29.205
aka, um... you.

16:29.205 --> 16:32.513
Oh, my God.

16:32.513 --> 16:35.385
Oh, it feels so good to
finally say that out loud.

16:35.385 --> 16:37.518
It took so long
to clear you all.

16:37.518 --> 16:39.650
How long has this
been going on for?

16:39.650 --> 16:41.261
Oh, for about two or three...

16:41.261 --> 16:44.046
You've been spying on us
for three weeks?

16:44.046 --> 16:45.874
...months.

16:45.874 --> 16:48.616
Does Vance know about this?

16:48.616 --> 16:51.314
Well, my handler said
that Director Vance...

16:51.314 --> 16:52.837
You got a handler?

16:52.837 --> 16:54.839
<i>This is not acceptable.</i>

16:54.839 --> 16:56.928
If there is a mole in NCIS,

16:56.928 --> 16:58.147
I should have been informed.

16:58.147 --> 16:59.409
Director Vance, we both know

16:59.409 --> 17:00.758
when it comes to mole hunting,

17:00.758 --> 17:02.456
everyone is placed
on a need-to-know basis.

17:02.456 --> 17:05.154
That's why I was meeting
with Ms. Hines off-site.

17:05.154 --> 17:06.895
Is that a polite way of saying

17:06.895 --> 17:08.897
that DCIS thought
I was a suspect?

17:09.898 --> 17:11.204
Everyone is a suspect.

17:11.204 --> 17:12.509
Except Kasie?

17:12.509 --> 17:14.250
We cleared Ms. Hines
before we tapped her

17:14.250 --> 17:15.599
as our inside operative.

17:15.599 --> 17:16.861
With all due respect
to Ms. Hines,

17:16.861 --> 17:18.037
why choose her?

17:18.037 --> 17:19.951
- Ouch.
- She's the one person who

17:19.951 --> 17:22.519
works hands-on with almost
every agent in the building.

17:22.519 --> 17:24.391
So she can conduct
her investigation

17:24.391 --> 17:25.696
without drawing suspicion.

17:25.696 --> 17:27.307
Not to mention
her superb skills

17:27.307 --> 17:28.743
collecting
forensic evidence.

17:30.440 --> 17:31.920
And what did you find,
Ms. Hines?

17:31.920 --> 17:35.141
It looks like Agent Khatri
was attempting to bypass

17:35.141 --> 17:37.795
internal security
on the NCIS network.

17:37.795 --> 17:39.101
For what purpose?

17:39.101 --> 17:41.147
I haven't been able
to figure it out.

17:41.147 --> 17:42.148
I'm sorry.

17:42.148 --> 17:43.192
Maybe if I had help

17:43.192 --> 17:45.238
I could have moved more quickly.

17:45.238 --> 17:47.196
You didn't give her
a support team?

17:47.196 --> 17:49.416
Given the sensitivity
of the investigation,

17:49.416 --> 17:51.026
we thought it best
she work alone.

17:51.026 --> 17:52.549
This is a huge assignment for

17:52.549 --> 17:53.985
any agent to do by themselves,

17:53.985 --> 17:55.596
let alone a forensic scientist.

17:55.596 --> 17:56.814
Wasn't your call.

17:56.814 --> 17:58.642
Well, it is now.

17:58.642 --> 18:00.905
I have a dead agent
and nobody can tell me why.

18:00.905 --> 18:03.995
Ms. Hines, you said
Parker's team has been cleared?

18:03.995 --> 18:05.127
That's correct, Director.

18:05.127 --> 18:06.607
Good.
Then Agent Parker,

18:06.607 --> 18:08.130
you can take over
the investigation from here.

18:08.130 --> 18:09.653
I don't think
that's warranted.

18:09.653 --> 18:11.351
Or we can go to SECNAV
and explain

18:11.351 --> 18:13.353
why you put
one of my people in danger

18:13.353 --> 18:14.571
without proper backup.

18:15.790 --> 18:17.531
I'm gonna need everything
you got on that mole.

18:17.531 --> 18:19.489
- Of course.
- And I'll make sure

18:19.489 --> 18:20.925
that Ms. Hines

18:20.925 --> 18:23.014
updates you as
information arises

18:23.014 --> 18:24.929
after I have
reviewed it.

18:24.929 --> 18:27.149
In the meantime, you're with us.

18:27.149 --> 18:29.499
Getting the support you should
have received from the start.

18:29.499 --> 18:31.762
This is our case now.

18:31.762 --> 18:34.113
Move fast.
Find that mole.

18:36.724 --> 18:38.378
Hey, guys.

18:38.378 --> 18:40.249
So I just went over
Kasie's report,

18:40.249 --> 18:42.425
and she is right.
Otis was definitely trying

18:42.425 --> 18:43.992
to access our secure servers.

18:43.992 --> 18:45.907
What? Any idea why?

18:45.907 --> 18:47.430
It looks like he was
trying to transfer data

18:47.430 --> 18:48.431
out of the building.

18:48.431 --> 18:50.346
So he was the mole.

18:51.347 --> 18:53.784
I don't believe it.
Who was he working for?

18:53.784 --> 18:55.656
Well, maybe himself.

18:55.656 --> 18:58.137
Found this list
in a dummy file

18:58.137 --> 18:59.703
hidden on his laptop.

18:59.703 --> 19:02.097
All big corporations
in oil and tech.

19:02.097 --> 19:04.360
- Almost looks like a client list.
- All those places

19:04.360 --> 19:06.493
would pay big for
the intel we have.

19:06.493 --> 19:09.670
So Otis was an industrial spy?

19:09.670 --> 19:11.933
That is a dangerous
game to play.

19:11.933 --> 19:13.456
Maybe that's what
got him killed.

19:13.456 --> 19:15.154
I don't buy it.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.807
Otis was one of
the good guys.

19:16.807 --> 19:18.635
I'm a pro at judging character.

19:18.635 --> 19:19.810
Really?

19:19.810 --> 19:21.377
Mm, I don't know.

19:21.377 --> 19:23.249
You couldn't tell that
Kasie was spying on us.

19:23.249 --> 19:24.685
Oh, that's different, okay,

19:24.685 --> 19:25.990
'cause Kasie was fighting
the good fight

19:25.990 --> 19:28.036
and she was
being Kasie.

19:28.036 --> 19:30.647
Well, I'm actually impressed
that she pulled it off.

19:30.647 --> 19:33.563
Yeah. Going undercover
is not easy.

19:33.563 --> 19:35.522
Wait a minute.

19:35.522 --> 19:37.350
Is that why she was
making me play that

19:37.350 --> 19:39.221
weird game of 20 questions
at the wine bar?

19:40.309 --> 19:43.094
I can't believe she thought
I could actually be the mole.

19:43.094 --> 19:44.618
Yeah, she was just
doing her job.

19:44.618 --> 19:46.576
She had to
investigate everyone.

19:46.576 --> 19:48.404
Hey, how much
of our personal info

19:48.404 --> 19:49.971
do you think she accessed?

19:50.972 --> 19:52.321
Why, Tim?

19:52.321 --> 19:54.497
You worried about
something specific?

19:54.497 --> 19:56.369
Mm, I got nothing to hide.

19:56.369 --> 19:57.805
Okay, Kasie says

19:57.805 --> 19:59.198
that she has a lead

19:59.198 --> 20:01.809
on what intel
Otis was trying to steal.

20:01.809 --> 20:04.246
So, uh, who's going
down to the lab?

20:04.246 --> 20:06.205
Not it.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.554
Not trying to get my
fingerprints lifted

20:07.554 --> 20:08.729
before lunch.

20:08.729 --> 20:10.296
And I'm still
knee-deep

20:10.296 --> 20:11.645
in my cat hunt,
trying to track down

20:11.645 --> 20:13.037
Prince Charming's microchip.

20:15.388 --> 20:16.693
Looks like you're up.

20:16.693 --> 20:18.260
Well, I would, uh,

20:18.260 --> 20:20.915
I would love to,
but actually, um...

20:20.915 --> 20:22.786
Can't think of anything?

20:22.786 --> 20:24.048
Can't think of anything.

20:27.226 --> 20:30.141
Meeting in the shadows
at night with secret agents?

20:30.141 --> 20:33.101
Kasie, this is like
some Grisham novel stuff.

20:33.101 --> 20:36.147
Uh, there's a lot less
action than you think.

20:36.147 --> 20:39.194
I spent most of my time
plotting and scheming.

20:39.194 --> 20:41.762
Mostly in my head,
which I'm supposed to be

20:41.762 --> 20:43.851
avoiding, actually, so...

20:43.851 --> 20:46.288
Hey, you dig up any dirt on me?

20:46.288 --> 20:49.509
Oh, don't be silly.
- You're clean as a whistle.
- I know, I know.

20:49.509 --> 20:51.641
But still, you had to
investigate me, right?

20:51.641 --> 20:55.906
Um, actually,
you weren't on the list.

20:57.473 --> 20:59.127
Oddly, that kind of hurts.

20:59.127 --> 21:02.130
Get in line. I've been
getting dirty looks all day.

21:02.130 --> 21:05.089
If you want the truth,
going undercover is lonely.

21:05.089 --> 21:06.613
I'll bet.

21:06.613 --> 21:09.485
I don't know how Torres
did it for so long.

21:09.485 --> 21:12.271
I hated keeping so many
secrets from my friends.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.490
I actually took the personal day

21:14.490 --> 21:16.187
so I could finish
clearing the team

21:16.187 --> 21:17.406
as soon as possible.

21:17.406 --> 21:19.321
Hey, Kase, heard
you got an update.

21:19.321 --> 21:22.759
That's it?
No questions?

21:22.759 --> 21:24.457
No lectures
about betrayal?

21:24.457 --> 21:28.156
Well, actually, uh,
now that you mention it,

21:28.156 --> 21:32.029
how deep did you go on your
personal record search?

21:32.029 --> 21:33.553
Oh, deep.

21:33.553 --> 21:35.250
Whatever you, uh,
whatever you saw,

21:35.250 --> 21:36.773
you gonna keep that
confidential, right?

21:36.773 --> 21:38.079
If it didn't
have anything

21:38.079 --> 21:39.341
to do with mole hunting, it went

21:39.341 --> 21:41.735
in one eyeball
and out the other.

21:41.735 --> 21:43.824
Great, great, okay.

21:43.824 --> 21:45.565
Speaking of mole hunting,

21:45.565 --> 21:48.524
I hear you have a lead on the
intel Otis was trying to steal?

21:48.524 --> 21:51.179
Yes. Now that you were able
to unlock his laptop,

21:51.179 --> 21:54.487
I was able to use it
to create a tracer program.

21:54.487 --> 21:55.879
It'll search for anything
Otis tried to remove

21:55.879 --> 21:56.880
from our servers.

21:56.880 --> 21:59.056
Hey, if you promise not to

21:59.056 --> 22:00.275
make my babies cry again,

22:00.275 --> 22:01.972
I'll let you start it up.

22:01.972 --> 22:03.365
Come on, Kase.

22:03.365 --> 22:05.759
You can do it, Jimmy.

22:08.805 --> 22:10.024
Yay.

22:10.024 --> 22:11.504
See? It wasn't so hard.

22:15.551 --> 22:17.292
Though that was a little quick.

22:17.292 --> 22:19.207
Because there's
no missing intel

22:19.207 --> 22:20.991
from the NCIS servers.

22:20.991 --> 22:23.385
Wait, so Otis
wasn't stealing secrets?

22:23.385 --> 22:26.257
Oh, he most definitely was.

22:26.257 --> 22:28.303
Just not from us.
Take a look.

22:30.740 --> 22:32.829
- What is that?
- Uh, data.

22:32.829 --> 22:35.266
Lots of it. All from
outside sources.

22:35.266 --> 22:38.052
Otis wasn't stealing
from NCIS.

22:38.052 --> 22:39.619
He was using the NCIS system

22:39.619 --> 22:41.708
to steal from somebody else.

22:49.890 --> 22:51.935
McGEE:
Well, the good news
is Otis didn't sell

22:51.935 --> 22:53.894
any NCIS intel.

22:53.894 --> 22:55.417
And the bad news?

22:55.417 --> 22:57.854
He was stealing all kinds
of proprietary intel

22:57.854 --> 22:58.986
from corporate America.

22:58.986 --> 23:00.596
And doing what with it?

23:00.596 --> 23:02.381
Well, judging by
the data encryption he used,

23:02.381 --> 23:04.644
I'd say Otis
was running some kind of

23:04.644 --> 23:06.559
dark web ransomware scheme.

23:06.559 --> 23:10.127
So, basically,
blah, blah and blah?

23:10.127 --> 23:11.607
He was stealing people's data

23:11.607 --> 23:13.479
and then demanding money
to give it back.

23:13.479 --> 23:15.132
So, the client list Kasie found?

23:15.132 --> 23:17.265
McGEE:
Probably more like
a victims list.

23:17.265 --> 23:20.442
Why would Otis
risk using government servers

23:20.442 --> 23:21.704
for a crime?

23:21.704 --> 23:23.402
Probably needed
the storage space

23:23.402 --> 23:25.273
I mean, the guy stole
a huge amount of data.

23:25.273 --> 23:27.493
A civilian server
would choke on it.

23:27.493 --> 23:29.451
And I'm guessing
the data overload

23:29.451 --> 23:31.322
is what caused ours
to slow down.

23:31.322 --> 23:33.455
So let's give the data back.

23:33.455 --> 23:35.849
Well, we can't. At least
not until we find Otis'

23:35.849 --> 23:37.372
encryption key
to unlock it.

23:37.372 --> 23:39.200
And Otis is dead.

23:39.200 --> 23:41.158
Ten bucks says his killer
knows where the key is.

23:42.943 --> 23:44.379
Now the killer's DNA
is probably

23:44.379 --> 23:46.468
still on Prince Charming's paws.

23:46.468 --> 23:48.905
Any new leads on Grumpy Cat?

23:48.905 --> 23:50.472
Still working on it.

23:50.472 --> 23:52.518
Calling all the shelters I can,
but nothing yet.

23:52.518 --> 23:53.780
All right, let's go with motive.

23:53.780 --> 23:55.608
Who would want to see Otis dead?

23:55.608 --> 23:58.175
I would say maybe
one of these companies

23:58.175 --> 24:00.003
decided to not pay the ransom.

24:00.003 --> 24:02.745
McGEE:
According to an unencrypted
ledger I found,

24:02.745 --> 24:04.747
every company on that list
has agreed to pay up

24:04.747 --> 24:07.228
except for one.

24:07.228 --> 24:09.230
Stay Home Market, Inc.

24:09.230 --> 24:11.275
McGEE:
It's a conglomerate of
worldwide delivery services,

24:11.275 --> 24:13.800
including the home food
delivery company

24:13.800 --> 24:15.410
Home Stretch Eats.

24:15.410 --> 24:17.978
Oh, I cannot survive
without Home Stretch eats.

24:17.978 --> 24:19.240
Hey, isn't that
the company

24:19.240 --> 24:20.807
that has that loser CEO

24:20.807 --> 24:22.330
that throws raves
around the world?

24:22.330 --> 24:24.593
Travis Baltoni.

24:24.593 --> 24:26.203
Well, considering that, uh,

24:26.203 --> 24:28.118
Prince Charming has been able

24:28.118 --> 24:31.600
to evade our in-house
animal tracking expert...

24:31.600 --> 24:34.560
I said I was still
- working on it.
- Okay. Okay.

24:34.560 --> 24:37.824
Hopefully Mr. Baltoni
will be easier to find.

24:37.824 --> 24:39.739
Oh, this is cool.

24:39.739 --> 24:41.610
NCRS teleconference.

24:41.610 --> 24:45.396
It's uh, it's "IS."
Uh, Mr. Baltoni...

24:45.396 --> 24:47.094
Aw, call me Travis, man.

24:47.094 --> 24:48.661
Unless that's illegal.

24:48.661 --> 24:51.577
- Why would that be illegal?
- Are you at a party?

24:51.577 --> 24:53.404
I'm on a yacht in Ibiza.

24:53.404 --> 24:55.058
Here, everything is a party.

24:55.058 --> 24:57.800
<i>Occupado.</i> Try the lower deck.

24:57.800 --> 25:01.325
I don't know if I should be
jealous or annoyed by this guy.

25:01.325 --> 25:03.414
I know what you mean.
It's very confusing.

25:03.414 --> 25:05.852
So, your company
admitted to being hit

25:05.852 --> 25:07.288
with a ransomware attack.

25:07.288 --> 25:08.811
Let me cut to the chase.

25:08.811 --> 25:10.509
I didn't kill your hacker.

25:10.509 --> 25:13.686
Okay, but you hadn't
agreed to pay him, either,

25:13.686 --> 25:15.209
So what was your plan?

25:15.209 --> 25:17.341
Tasked my entire IT department
to find him.

25:17.341 --> 25:19.648
Then, I was gonna kill him.

25:19.648 --> 25:23.522
Okay. You do know you're talking
to federal agents, right?

25:23.522 --> 25:25.306
A man has limits.
Just this morning,

25:25.306 --> 25:27.134
the guy tripled the ransom.

25:27.134 --> 25:29.440
Wait, whose morning?

25:29.440 --> 25:31.965
Ibiza afternoon, D.C. morning.
You feel me?

25:31.965 --> 25:34.881
Tripling the price is lame
no matter the time zone.

25:34.881 --> 25:37.274
Otis was dead this morning.

25:37.274 --> 25:39.276
That means the new ransom demand

25:39.276 --> 25:41.017
came in after he was killed.

25:41.017 --> 25:42.541
Then who sent it?

25:42.541 --> 25:44.543
Otis might have a partner.

25:44.543 --> 25:47.894
Mr. Baltoni.
Uh, sorry, Travis.

25:47.894 --> 25:49.722
We would like access
to your servers.

25:49.722 --> 25:52.246
That way we can work together

25:52.246 --> 25:54.683
to find that hacker,
hopefully retrieve your data.

25:54.683 --> 25:56.946
I may look young
and sound stupid,

25:56.946 --> 25:59.558
but if NCIS could have
gotten back my data,

25:59.558 --> 26:00.559
you already would have.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.386
Well, we still can.

26:02.386 --> 26:04.650
Too late. You were wrong.

26:04.650 --> 26:07.914
I actually did pay the ransom,
right before you called.

26:07.914 --> 26:09.568
Who'd you send the money to?

26:09.568 --> 26:13.310
No way. I have a subsidiary
IPO coming up next week.

26:13.310 --> 26:15.095
I'm not risking our data leak
going public.

26:15.095 --> 26:17.140
That won't happen,
but we still need to know

26:17.140 --> 26:18.620
who you sent the money to.

26:18.620 --> 26:21.057
Oh, sounds like
there's a line growing.

26:21.057 --> 26:24.495
Good luck catching the bad guy. Peace.

26:25.279 --> 26:28.674
Okay, yeah, definitely
more annoyed than jealous.

26:28.674 --> 26:30.850
And we're sure I'm the best
person to go undercover?

26:30.850 --> 26:33.461
I mean, you or Parker
could easily trace

26:33.461 --> 26:34.636
the ransomware payment

26:34.636 --> 26:36.029
in Stay Home Market's server.

26:36.029 --> 26:37.596
Yeah, they would
stick out like

26:37.596 --> 26:39.380
sore thumbs at
Stay Home Market.

26:39.380 --> 26:41.643
- We're just too old.
- Yeah.

26:41.643 --> 26:43.906
- No offense.
- None taken.

26:43.906 --> 26:46.387
Now, Kasie, you've been working
on this thing for months.

26:46.387 --> 26:48.824
The reality is you're better
equipped than any of us.

26:48.824 --> 26:51.261
I don'’t feel better equipped.

26:51.261 --> 26:53.960
Oh! We have a warrant.

26:53.960 --> 26:55.875
What if we just

26:55.875 --> 26:57.877
asked them nicely
who they paid, huh?

26:57.877 --> 27:00.314
Their CEO made it very clear

27:00.314 --> 27:02.011
he's not going to share
any info.

27:02.011 --> 27:03.883
Yeah, we go in through the
front door, they're gonna start

27:03.883 --> 27:05.580
- tossing records out the back.
- Oh.

27:05.580 --> 27:07.669
So you're sending me in
through an air vent.

27:07.669 --> 27:09.279
Well, it is the safest way

27:09.279 --> 27:11.281
to get into the server room undetected.

27:12.326 --> 27:13.936
Parking lot, utility tunnel,

27:13.936 --> 27:16.635
air vent, server room.

27:16.635 --> 27:19.550
Your comms should be working.
You want to give 'em a go?

27:19.550 --> 27:20.856
Test, test,

27:20.856 --> 27:23.685
this is Kasie Hines,
aka Ellen Ripley,

27:23.685 --> 27:25.774
last survivor of the <i>Nostromo.</i>

27:25.774 --> 27:28.647
Well, luckily you aren't
fighting aliens in space.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.866
- And now for your camera.
- Okay,

27:30.866 --> 27:32.825
going undercover as me

27:32.825 --> 27:33.826
was hard enough,

27:33.826 --> 27:35.175
but as a whole new person?

27:35.175 --> 27:38.134
That's...
that's a whole new thing.

27:38.134 --> 27:40.223
Well, hopefully
you don't run into anyone.

27:40.223 --> 27:42.878
But you know
I am not a good liar

27:42.878 --> 27:44.837
or negotiator or swimmer,
for that matter.

27:44.837 --> 27:47.187
Well, we promise there
will be no swimming.

27:47.187 --> 27:49.319
All you need to do
is get to that central server

27:49.319 --> 27:52.322
and find out who Baltoni
sent the ransom to.

27:52.322 --> 27:54.455
And this time you're
not working alone.

27:54.455 --> 27:56.500
The whole team has your back.

27:58.198 --> 27:59.678
Okay.

28:00.679 --> 28:02.550
- Hey.
- You all hooked up?

28:02.550 --> 28:05.292
Yep. I just, um...

28:07.163 --> 28:10.340
Hey, you know,
ever since I revealed

28:10.340 --> 28:11.820
my secret Bourne identity...

28:11.820 --> 28:13.387
You mean spied on us?

28:14.431 --> 28:18.000
Um, you haven't been
down to the lab.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.307
Oh, I've just been stuck
looking for this stupid cat.

28:20.307 --> 28:23.049
Don't tell Parker,
but tracking caribou--

28:23.049 --> 28:24.267
so much easier.

28:24.267 --> 28:26.748
Okay.

28:26.748 --> 28:28.532
But I hope it's not because
you feel like

28:28.532 --> 28:30.186
I betrayed you or something.

28:30.186 --> 28:32.667
And if you do, I just
want to apologize. It was...

28:32.667 --> 28:33.886
Stop right there.

28:33.886 --> 28:36.105
See? I knew it, I knew it.

28:36.105 --> 28:37.846
That is totally your mad face.

28:37.846 --> 28:41.458
No, this is my annoyed face.

28:41.458 --> 28:44.026
And I'm making it because
you have absolutely nothing

28:44.026 --> 28:45.288
to apologize for.

28:46.289 --> 28:48.291
Well, agree to disagree.

28:48.291 --> 28:51.425
Kasie, if anything,
I'm proud of you.

28:52.643 --> 28:54.863
You took a flying leap
out of your comfort zone,

28:54.863 --> 28:56.082
and that takes guts.

28:56.082 --> 28:57.648
I know, but maybe
if I had...

28:57.648 --> 28:59.476
No, no maybes, no buts.

28:59.476 --> 29:01.174
You're overthinking this.

29:01.174 --> 29:02.566
And in this line of work,

29:02.566 --> 29:04.003
that's a good way
to end up on your ass.

29:05.787 --> 29:08.616
Oh, Prince Charming's
owner just resurfaced.

29:08.616 --> 29:11.314
Lieutenant Laredo?
And?

29:11.314 --> 29:13.490
She says that Prince Charming
runs away a lot,

29:13.490 --> 29:14.622
but he never gets far.

29:14.622 --> 29:16.842
- That's promising.
- And in order

29:16.842 --> 29:20.323
to get him back, she just
sings his favorite song.

29:21.368 --> 29:23.457
So what's the song
you have to sing?

29:23.457 --> 29:26.068
♪ Meow, meow

29:26.068 --> 29:28.462
♪ My puffy, scruffy
bubbly boo ♪

29:28.462 --> 29:31.073
♪ My dearest Prince Charming

29:31.073 --> 29:33.684
♪ I'’ll always love you. ♪

29:33.684 --> 29:35.425
That's rough.

29:35.425 --> 29:38.820
I have to sing this song
to get that cat back.

29:38.820 --> 29:40.648
Yeah, okay, hey,

29:40.648 --> 29:41.997
you want to trade places?

29:41.997 --> 29:43.651
Oh, uh, no.
I-I would rather

29:43.651 --> 29:46.001
military crawl
through a ventilation shaft.

29:47.176 --> 29:48.525
You have fun.

29:48.525 --> 29:49.744
Take a video for me.

29:49.744 --> 29:52.355
♪ Meow, meow

29:52.355 --> 29:54.793
♪ My puffy, scruffy
bubbly boo. ♪

30:09.198 --> 30:11.810
♪ Meow, meow

30:11.810 --> 30:14.508
♪ My puffy, scruffy
bubbly boo. ♪

30:14.508 --> 30:16.510
Oh, people are so worried about

30:16.510 --> 30:18.817
digital security these days,
they really kind of

30:18.817 --> 30:21.558
forget about how... Shh, Kasie. You
need to whisper.

30:21.558 --> 30:23.517
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was saying

30:23.517 --> 30:26.563
they really kind of forget about
good, old-fashioned air vents.

30:26.563 --> 30:30.698
Guys, I am feeling
real action hero vibes.

30:30.698 --> 30:33.309
Okay,
just remember to be quiet

30:33.309 --> 30:35.311
and don't scream
if you see a rat.

30:35.311 --> 30:37.096
Wait, what?

30:37.096 --> 30:39.446
Rats?!
You did not tell...

30:39.446 --> 30:42.057
And don't worry, Kasie, there
aren't gonna be any rats.

30:42.057 --> 30:43.885
Are you kidding me?

30:43.885 --> 30:45.191
What are you doing?

30:45.191 --> 30:46.627
Me? You're the one
lying to her.

30:46.627 --> 30:47.933
There could totally be rats.

30:47.933 --> 30:50.065
I can still hear you.

30:50.065 --> 30:51.850
Okay, Kasie, you got this.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.939
All right?
Just-just keep moving forward.

30:53.939 --> 30:55.984
The server room
should be ahead to your left.

30:55.984 --> 30:57.768
And we are right
here with you.

30:57.768 --> 31:00.336
I know it.
And hey, I just want to say...

31:00.336 --> 31:02.077
Okay, here comes
more apologies.

31:02.077 --> 31:03.513
Uh, no.

31:03.513 --> 31:06.255
That is so two hours ago.

31:07.561 --> 31:09.955
I did my job.
And you know what?

31:09.955 --> 31:11.870
Yeah, I kicked ass.

31:11.870 --> 31:12.914
Much better.

31:12.914 --> 31:14.002
Digging into

31:14.002 --> 31:15.699
each of your personnel files

31:15.699 --> 31:17.092
made me feel
so much closer to you.

31:17.092 --> 31:19.529
And you guys are
some of the finest people

31:19.529 --> 31:20.748
I have ever met.

31:20.748 --> 31:22.968
Well, except for
McGee's obsession

31:22.968 --> 31:24.926
with some online store called

31:24.926 --> 31:26.493
Lovey's Sensory Chest.

31:27.189 --> 31:28.930
Okay, all right, slow your roll.

31:28.930 --> 31:31.585
Oh, and I just realized

31:31.585 --> 31:33.456
that is probably what you wanted
me to keep a secret.

31:33.456 --> 31:34.893
I do apologize for that.

31:34.893 --> 31:37.199
Lovey's Sensory Chest?

31:37.199 --> 31:39.071
Mm, you wild man.

31:39.071 --> 31:40.681
It's a kids store, okay?

31:40.681 --> 31:42.161
They sell tactile toys

31:42.161 --> 31:43.989
and developmental games
for children.

31:43.989 --> 31:45.555
The owner's name is Sam Lovey.

31:45.555 --> 31:47.035
If you say so.

31:47.035 --> 31:48.732
Kasie,
will you tell them, please?

31:48.732 --> 31:52.127
No, it was my job
to investigate, not to judge.

31:52.127 --> 31:54.042
Well, I'm feeling judged
right now.

31:54.042 --> 31:56.915
Wait, hold up.

32:04.705 --> 32:07.229
I think I found
the central server.

32:07.229 --> 32:09.144
Sam Lovey's
gonna have to wait.

32:20.025 --> 32:22.070
Ooh.

32:23.767 --> 32:25.856
<i>Okay, I'm in.</i>

32:25.856 --> 32:27.206
All right, Rambo.

32:27.206 --> 32:28.511
Okay let's start with
that far server.

32:28.511 --> 32:30.383
The one with
the access terminal.

32:32.472 --> 32:33.995
No, the access terminal

32:33.995 --> 32:35.605
behind you.

32:35.605 --> 32:37.085
Copy that.

32:37.085 --> 32:38.217
What are you doing in here?

32:43.004 --> 32:44.397
Kasie, say something.

32:44.397 --> 32:45.876
Uh...

32:45.876 --> 32:48.618
is that a carton of milk?

32:48.618 --> 32:49.924
Maybe
something else.

32:49.924 --> 32:51.665
Gross. It's boxed water.

32:51.665 --> 32:53.536
Save the environment much?

32:53.536 --> 32:55.451
I usually use a glass

32:55.451 --> 32:57.584
or a stainless steel travel mug.

32:58.585 --> 33:00.065
Do you work here?

33:00.065 --> 33:02.241
'Cause you feel more Facebook
than Snapchat.

33:02.241 --> 33:03.807
Are you calling me old?

33:03.807 --> 33:05.200
That would be rude.

33:05.200 --> 33:06.593
And against policy.

33:06.593 --> 33:09.030
So, back to what are you
doing here?

33:09.030 --> 33:11.685
I, uh... Huh?

33:11.685 --> 33:14.209
What department are you in?
What's your name?

33:14.209 --> 33:16.472
Okay, breathe, Kasie.

33:16.472 --> 33:20.041
Do not let this girl call
you a Boomer. You got this.

33:20.041 --> 33:21.738
I don't know about that.

33:21.738 --> 33:23.436
Y-You don't know your name?

33:23.436 --> 33:25.307
Are-are you good?

33:26.482 --> 33:28.528
Okay, this is sus.
I'm gonna call security.

33:28.528 --> 33:30.269
Okay, Kasie, stop

33:30.269 --> 33:33.881
overthinking this. Just channel
that-that inner badass

33:33.881 --> 33:35.622
aquatic elf warrior thing

33:35.622 --> 33:37.711
that you play on the
video game. Be, uh...

33:37.711 --> 33:38.755
Kana-Hune.

33:39.452 --> 33:40.844
What?

33:40.844 --> 33:43.238
That's my name.
Kana-Hune.

33:43.238 --> 33:46.502
Oh. Is that Polynesian?

33:46.502 --> 33:48.069
You owe me answers.

33:48.069 --> 33:50.898
Like what are you doing
with that water in here?

33:50.898 --> 33:53.292
I, uh... Huh?

33:53.292 --> 33:55.729
This is the brain
of our beloved company.

33:55.729 --> 33:58.601
And you bring open liquid

33:58.601 --> 34:00.864
in a paper container?

34:00.864 --> 34:02.344
Read a sign much?

34:02.344 --> 34:05.173
No liquid
in the server room, ever.

34:05.173 --> 34:07.349
Get out.

34:08.350 --> 34:09.569
Okay.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.267
That was awesome.

34:12.267 --> 34:13.747
Go, Kana-Hune.

34:13.747 --> 34:15.183
Yeah, whoever that is.

34:15.183 --> 34:16.837
Okay.

34:16.837 --> 34:19.057
I am at the server.
Now what?

34:19.057 --> 34:22.321
Well, based on the Unix shell,
let's do a frame-based approach

34:22.321 --> 34:23.539
to access the core.

34:23.539 --> 34:25.019
I like the way you think.

34:28.544 --> 34:30.242
I'm in. Looking for

34:30.242 --> 34:32.635
the Stay Home Market
account server.

34:32.635 --> 34:35.595
Search by any payments
directly authorized by the CEO

34:35.595 --> 34:36.944
in the last five hours.

34:38.859 --> 34:40.426
Okay, got something.

34:40.426 --> 34:42.297
Sending it over now.

34:43.777 --> 34:45.605
All right, got it.

34:45.605 --> 34:47.737
According to this,
Baltoni moved the money

34:47.737 --> 34:49.739
to an offshore account
in the Caymans.

34:49.739 --> 34:51.393
Oh, that has to belong to Otis.

34:51.393 --> 34:53.830
- That's odd.
- What is?

34:53.830 --> 34:55.441
McGEE:
Well, the account was set up to

34:55.441 --> 34:56.790
auto-transfer the money back out

34:56.790 --> 34:58.400
as soon as the money
was deposited.

34:58.400 --> 35:00.533
Maybe Otis didn't want
the money to be traced.

35:00.533 --> 35:03.579
Well, if that's the case,
Otis sure was moving the money

35:03.579 --> 35:05.277
into some interesting places.

35:05.277 --> 35:06.887
Interesting how?

35:06.887 --> 35:09.455
He's been donating it all
to charity.

35:20.422 --> 35:23.382
So an NCIS agent
steals millions

35:23.382 --> 35:25.123
and then gives it away?

35:25.123 --> 35:28.865
Yep. Otis donated his cash
to over a dozen charities.

35:28.865 --> 35:30.954
Two million to Cancer Research

35:30.954 --> 35:33.043
and Diagnostics
of America alone.

35:33.043 --> 35:35.220
At first, we thought,
well, maybe he's

35:35.220 --> 35:37.483
using these nonprofits
to launder the money.

35:37.483 --> 35:40.747
A cancer charity?
Classy.

35:40.747 --> 35:44.054
Do any of these charities have
any known connections to Otis?

35:44.054 --> 35:45.447
Tough to say.
We'd have to interview

35:45.447 --> 35:47.145
all of them to know for sure.

35:47.145 --> 35:49.277
So, what, we just
break down the door

35:49.277 --> 35:52.802
of, uh, Cancer Research
and Diagnostics of America?

35:52.802 --> 35:54.891
Ooh, that may not be necessary.
Look at this.

35:54.891 --> 35:56.763
Stay Home Market, Inc.

35:56.763 --> 35:58.982
pledged two million
dollars to the CRDA

35:58.982 --> 36:00.984
last year but never paid a cent.

36:00.984 --> 36:04.205
And a year later,
Otis ransomed Stay Home Market

36:04.205 --> 36:05.902
for the exact same amount.

36:05.902 --> 36:08.688
Hmm.
Isn't that a coincidence?

36:08.688 --> 36:10.559
All right, cross-check the other
companies that he ransomed.

36:10.559 --> 36:13.475
See if any of them also made
pledges that they never kept.

36:15.564 --> 36:17.218
Okay, every company
on this list

36:17.218 --> 36:19.873
made a public pledge to donate
but never actually paid.

36:19.873 --> 36:22.049
Well, get all the PR
and none of the pain?

36:22.049 --> 36:24.269
Yeah, until Otis
forced it on 'em.

36:24.269 --> 36:26.227
He wasn't stealing money
for himself.

36:26.227 --> 36:27.272
'Cause he was some kind of, uh,

36:27.272 --> 36:28.403
Robin Hood hacker.

36:28.403 --> 36:29.361
Forcing companies to

36:29.361 --> 36:30.623
make good on pledges

36:30.623 --> 36:32.668
which they never
intended to honor.

36:33.930 --> 36:36.846
Well, look what the cat
dragged in.

36:36.846 --> 36:40.763
I can't believe singing that
stupid song actually worked.

36:40.763 --> 36:42.852
Yeah, well, I can't
believe you doubted me.

36:42.852 --> 36:44.332
That's a handsome cat.

36:44.332 --> 36:45.855
And he knows it, too.

36:45.855 --> 36:47.422
Bloody paws and all.

36:47.422 --> 36:49.294
Isn't that right,
Prince Charming?

36:49.294 --> 36:50.382
You didn't lick your
paws 'cause you knew

36:50.382 --> 36:52.166
you had a murder to solve.

36:52.166 --> 36:55.169
Well, or he was too spoiled
to actually clean himself.

36:55.169 --> 36:57.606
Either way, the prince
has a date with Kasie

36:57.606 --> 36:59.042
to test the blood.

36:59.042 --> 37:00.914
Small problem.
Kasie's not down there.

37:00.914 --> 37:03.264
She's off briefing the DCIS.

37:06.528 --> 37:08.182
Kasie, thanks for coming.

37:08.182 --> 37:09.749
Yeah, I didn't know
it was optional.

37:09.749 --> 37:11.229
Go ahead, hop in.

37:18.584 --> 37:21.630
Ah. Cool office.[chuckles] Sorry.

37:21.630 --> 37:23.763
I know meeting like this
must seem a little odd,

37:23.763 --> 37:25.765
but in our work you can
never be too careful.

37:25.765 --> 37:27.854
Odd? Not at all.

37:27.854 --> 37:30.378
It's actually my second
creepy van of the day.

37:30.378 --> 37:33.076
Okay, let's get started.

37:34.600 --> 37:36.384
You owe me, Jess.
I promised Kasie

37:36.384 --> 37:37.994
I would never
touch her babies again.

37:37.994 --> 37:40.258
We need to know whose
blood is on those paws.

37:40.258 --> 37:43.043
All right, buddy,
do not get aggro.

37:43.043 --> 37:44.523
I'm just gonna
give you some grub.

37:44.523 --> 37:47.003
Do not attack me again.

37:47.003 --> 37:48.614
Wait, what? Again?

37:50.790 --> 37:51.878
Aah! Okay.

37:52.879 --> 37:55.011
That is not a normal cat.

37:55.011 --> 37:56.535
That is a demon in a cat suit.

37:56.535 --> 37:58.711
- Look at this.
- Whoa!

37:58.711 --> 37:59.973
- He really got you.
- Yeah.

37:59.973 --> 38:02.236
It was a fight for
the ages, Jimmy.

38:02.236 --> 38:03.672
Okay. All right.

38:13.856 --> 38:15.205
Hey.

38:16.381 --> 38:18.774
Well, I guess Prince Charming
was super hungry.

38:18.774 --> 38:21.299
It's probably why he was
so aggro earlier.

38:21.299 --> 38:22.735
Okay, don't defend him.

38:22.735 --> 38:24.867
I'm not.
I'm just saying.

38:24.867 --> 38:26.782
Okay, whose side are you on?

38:26.782 --> 38:28.436
I think you know
whose side I'm on.

38:29.959 --> 38:31.352
Let me see your arm.

38:38.185 --> 38:40.883
I hope that ding
means we have a match.

38:40.883 --> 38:43.930
We do have a match.

38:43.930 --> 38:46.846
Great. Who is it?

38:50.589 --> 38:52.895
So there never
was a mole in NCIS?

38:52.895 --> 38:55.289
No.
Agent Khatri wasn't spying.

38:55.289 --> 38:56.725
He was running a ransomware con.

38:57.726 --> 38:59.598
Traced all the money he stole
to an account in the Caymans.

38:59.598 --> 39:02.340
- Well, how'd he end up dead?
- We aren't sure.

39:02.340 --> 39:03.993
But someone is still
running the con.

39:03.993 --> 39:06.735
So, obviously,
we're missing something.

39:06.735 --> 39:09.651
Mm. Well, then we wait.

39:09.651 --> 39:11.740
Yeah, somebody's gonna
eventually come for that money.

39:11.740 --> 39:13.786
No, they aren't.

39:13.786 --> 39:14.961
The money's already gone,

39:14.961 --> 39:16.745
and it's gonna be
a little awkward

39:16.745 --> 39:18.443
asking for it back.

39:18.443 --> 39:20.575
Yeah, it's not
a good look asking a charity

39:20.575 --> 39:22.185
to refund a donation.

39:28.453 --> 39:29.497
What?

39:31.064 --> 39:33.893
I never said anything
about any charity.

39:43.119 --> 39:44.773
That's the sedan Kasie took.

39:46.296 --> 39:47.428
Yep.

39:48.734 --> 39:50.692
Her cell phone.

39:50.692 --> 39:51.998
Who leaves their
cell in the car?

39:57.395 --> 39:59.571
On three.

40:05.272 --> 40:08.144
If you try one more time to...
Ooh, hey.

40:08.144 --> 40:09.885
That's good timing.

40:10.886 --> 40:11.974
Kasie, you okay?

40:11.974 --> 40:13.585
Oh, yeah.
She went for her gun.

40:13.585 --> 40:15.325
Well, that was dumb.

40:15.325 --> 40:17.719
But not as dumb
as letting Prince Charming

40:17.719 --> 40:19.373
get your blood all over
the crime scene.

40:19.373 --> 40:21.288
The damn cat. That's how you
caught me.

40:21.288 --> 40:23.290
Well, technically, we're not
the ones that caught you.

40:23.290 --> 40:24.987
She is.

40:24.987 --> 40:26.554
Where'd you get
the zip ties, Kasie?

40:26.554 --> 40:28.034
They were hers.

40:28.034 --> 40:29.818
Those companies
deserved what they got.

40:29.818 --> 40:31.080
And you're gonna lock me up?

40:31.080 --> 40:33.300
Did Otis Khatri
deserve what he got?

40:33.300 --> 40:36.303
I'm tired of corporations
promising one thing

40:36.303 --> 40:37.739
and delivering another.

40:37.739 --> 40:40.220
Real people depended
on those donations.

40:40.220 --> 40:43.745
Otis was a real person
with a real family.

40:51.579 --> 40:54.800
- Damn, Kasie. I'm impressed.
- Mm.

40:54.800 --> 40:57.629
She who hesitates is lost.

41:01.154 --> 41:02.503
<i>Did I hear right that</i>

41:02.503 --> 41:04.331
Otis wasn't
our Robin Hood hacker?

41:04.331 --> 41:06.681
Nope, he had nothing to do
with the ransomware plot.

41:06.681 --> 41:08.509
- It was all Greyson.
- Yeah, all Otis did

41:08.509 --> 41:10.468
was flag the discrepancy
and report it.

41:10.468 --> 41:12.382
Unfortunately, it was to her.

41:12.382 --> 41:13.819
Which left Greyson no choice

41:13.819 --> 41:15.603
but to start
an official investigation.

41:15.603 --> 41:17.431
But why kill Otis?

41:17.431 --> 41:19.520
Well, we think Greyson just
got in too deep.

41:19.520 --> 41:22.480
Otis reported
the suspicious activity.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.612
She panicked and tried
to pin it all on him.

41:24.612 --> 41:26.919
And she thought she could
use Ms. Hines to do it?

41:26.919 --> 41:28.529
Bad choice. Ironically,

41:28.529 --> 41:31.227
Greyson turned out to be worse

41:31.227 --> 41:32.838
than the corporations
she tried to bring down.

41:32.838 --> 41:35.797
Thank you so much.
Otis would have been so proud.

41:35.797 --> 41:37.146
And you should be, too.

41:37.146 --> 41:38.974
I know we are.

41:38.974 --> 41:41.847
Ms. Khatri.

41:44.066 --> 41:46.286
Your brother was a hero.

41:47.548 --> 41:49.985
This is an honor.

41:49.985 --> 41:53.815
Thank you all so much
for clearing his name.

41:53.815 --> 41:56.165
Ms. Hines did
most of the heavy lifting.

41:56.165 --> 41:58.951
I would love
to thank her as well.

41:58.951 --> 42:00.692
Where is she?

42:05.261 --> 42:06.785
You know what to do.

42:06.785 --> 42:11.267
Just quiet your mind,
trust yourself.

42:11.267 --> 42:13.705
I am Kana-Hune!

42:17.665 --> 42:20.407
So...

42:20.407 --> 42:21.843
how about that belt?
