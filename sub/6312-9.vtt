00:02.300 --> 00:04.689
*

00:13.110 --> 00:15.237
Sherlock!
That sounded like

00:15.280 --> 00:17.339
the first volley
of a recrimination.

00:17.380 --> 00:19.211
Do you care to explain this?

00:19.250 --> 00:20.410
Clyde is a Horsfield's tortoise

00:20.450 --> 00:22.213
and needs to hibernate
in the winter.

00:22.250 --> 00:26.516
Right, but you normally let him
dig a burrow in the backyard.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.755
Given the erratic nature of
New York's recent winters,

00:28.790 --> 00:32.191
he needs a more controlled
enVIronment for hIs wmter nap.

00:32.230 --> 00:34.357
The refrigerator
is ideal, maintaining

00:34.400 --> 00:37.198
a constant temperature of
four degrees centigrade.

00:37.230 --> 00:40.267
I see you're planning a
movie night in my absence.

00:40.300 --> 00:42.165
Yep. Godfather I and II.

00:42.210 --> 00:44.166
You know, it's not too late to
cast about your social network

00:44.210 --> 00:47.179
for a companion for the evening.
Either in or out.

00:47.210 --> 00:49.599
It's been
a long time

00:49.650 --> 00:52.346
since you've enjoyed
any intimate contact.

00:57.250 --> 00:58.239
I'm fine.

00:58.290 --> 01:00.178
Have fun with Athena
and Minerva.

01:00.220 --> 01:02.256
Yeah, it's impossible not to.

01:06.460 --> 01:08.325
Sleep tight.

01:12.670 --> 01:14.467
(exhales)

01:14.500 --> 01:17.105
(doorbell rings)

01:18.870 --> 01:21.373
(sighs)

01:23.310 --> 01:24.800
Good evening.

01:24.850 --> 01:27.318
Sherlock's not here.

01:27.350 --> 01:30.080
Actually, I've come to see you.

01:32.320 --> 01:35.118
Come in.

01:39.760 --> 01:41.398
(door shuts, locks)

01:41.430 --> 01:43.227
I won't be long.

01:43.270 --> 01:45.898
I wanted _to extend
an InVItatIon.

01:45.930 --> 01:48.160
Well, apparently you're
something of a gourmand

01:48.200 --> 01:50.407
when it comes _
to the more adventurous Side

01:50.440 --> 01:52.169
of modern cuisine.

01:52.210 --> 01:53.575
Sure.

01:53.610 --> 01:57.569

01:57.610 --> 02:00.818
tomorrow night,
and the chef's a rising star.

02:00.850 --> 02:03.887
And in my experience,

02:03.920 --> 02:05.717
these meals are best enjoyed
across the table

02:05.750 --> 02:07.718
from someone
who appreCIates them.

02:07.760 --> 02:10.729
Ithought
you might like to join me.

02:10.760 --> 02:13.422
Just me?

02:13.460 --> 02:15.428
Sherlock is welcome to join,

02:15.460 --> 02:18.566
but it's hard to imagine him
at such an event.

02:18.600 --> 02:21.489
To him,
food is mere fuel.

02:21.540 --> 02:23.735
And he was never comfortable
in the crowd.

02:23.770 --> 02:25.408
Shall we say...

02:25.440 --> 02:26.873
8:00?

02:28.480 --> 02:30.869
(dance music playing faintly)

02:36.490 --> 02:37.445
The Bentley, please.

02:37.490 --> 02:38.286
Yes, sir.

02:38.320 --> 02:40.288
Right away, sir.

02:40.320 --> 02:41.856
(automatic gunfire)

02:42.660 --> 02:44.457
(woman screams)

02:53.800 --> 02:55.438
(tires screech)

02:57.010 --> 02:59.274
(horn honks)
(tires screech)

03:03.310 --> 03:06.347
(panﬁng)

03:06.380 --> 03:07.916
(beep, tires screeching)

03:13.460 --> 03:14.552
(panﬁng)

03:19.830 --> 03:21.354
(horn honking)

03:24.500 --> 03:26.468
(engine rewing)

03:32.840 --> 03:34.478
(ding)

03:35.780 --> 03:36.804
(tires screech)

03:38.950 --> 03:42.408
*

04:12.880 --> 04:14.370
I didn't see much.

04:14.420 --> 04:15.842
Shots rang out,
I dove for cover.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.689
I saw a gray car
driving away fast.

04:17.720 --> 04:19.859
Gray car. Anything else?

04:19.890 --> 04:22.586
No. 1-1 got to go.
Can I... can I go?

04:22.630 --> 04:25.349
What's the best way to reach you
in case we have more questions?

04:25.390 --> 04:28.689
This is my office.

04:28.730 --> 04:30.368
All right. We'll be in touch.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.766
(indistinct police radio
transmission)

04:41.440 --> 04:43.408
What do we got?

04:43.450 --> 04:46.874
Drive-by. Sort of.

04:46.920 --> 04:49.787
This guy was the target. After
the shooter sprayed the area,

04:49.820 --> 04:52.084
he got out of the car
and pumped another burst

04:52.120 --> 04:53.087
into his chest.

04:53.120 --> 04:54.849
Big guy was
his bodyguard.

04:54.890 --> 04:57.586
Valet was just in the
wrong place at the wrong time.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.996
MLI found a Russian passport

05:00.030 --> 05:03.864
identifying him
as Maxim Zolotov, a resident

05:03.900 --> 05:05.765
of Saint Petersburg.

05:05.800 --> 05:06.937
His shoes were alligator,
custom-made.

05:06.970 --> 05:08.938
Suit-- custom, too.

05:08.970 --> 05:12.371
So not just a Russian.
A very rich Russian.

05:12.410 --> 05:13.934
Where's Sherlock?

05:13.980 --> 05:15.538
He was out with some friends.

05:15.580 --> 05:17.468
I sent a radio car to get him.

05:17.510 --> 05:18.943
Since when does he have friends?

05:18.980 --> 05:21.744
_ These _are
more like exerCIse partners.

05:23.890 --> 05:26.882
I'll see _
how close he IS.

05:28.890 --> 05:30.482
(line ringing)

05:30.530 --> 05:31.883
HOLMES: Watson?

05:31.930 --> 05:32.999
Hey.

05:33.030 --> 05:34.827
Where are you?
Crime scene.

05:34.860 --> 05:36.088
I'm here. I don't see you.

05:36.130 --> 05:37.927
I'm at the second crime scene.

05:37.970 --> 05:39.892
I found your shooters.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.498
As luck would have it,

05:41.540 --> 05:43.098
both been murdered.

05:43.140 --> 05:45.734
(indistinct police radio
transmission)

05:48.740 --> 05:51.538
Officer Walker andI
were moments from jomlng you

05:51.580 --> 05:54.140
when news of this crashed
blue sedan came over the radio.

05:54.180 --> 05:55.875
I recalled the shooters
at the strip club escaped

05:55.920 --> 05:58.741
in a gray sedan,
so I asked him to pull over.

05:58.790 --> 06:01.588
Why? You just said
the colors don't match.

06:01.620 --> 06:03.850
I happen to know the area
where the shooting took place

06:03.890 --> 06:06.552
is illuminated by high-pressure
sodium street lamps.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.091
It casts a yellow glow
over its environs.

06:09.130 --> 06:11.928
This locale has LED lights,
which are blue/white in color.

06:11.970 --> 06:13.892
WATSON:
This car looks gray

06:13.940 --> 06:15.669
in sodium light, blue under LED.

06:15.700 --> 06:18.498
Further inspection revealed
that the passenger

06:18.540 --> 06:20.132
smells of cordite

06:20.180 --> 06:23.968
and there is a firearm
entangled In the wreckage.

06:25.480 --> 06:27.448
WATSON:
So these are our guys.

06:27.480 --> 06:29.983
You said they were murdered, but
it looks like they lost control

06:30.020 --> 06:31.749
of their car and crashed.

06:31.790 --> 06:34.418
I think that's the impression
someone wants to convey.

06:34.460 --> 06:36.849
Note the position
of the driver's right foot.

06:36.890 --> 06:40.428
It appears he was attempting
to depress the brake pedal,

06:40.460 --> 06:41.927
but there are no skid marks
on the roadway above.

06:41.960 --> 06:43.928
There are also indications
he was attempting,

06:43.970 --> 06:45.858
struggling to pull the wheel
to the exact

06:45.900 --> 06:49.131
opposite direction
of its fatal final turn.

06:51.040 --> 06:52.871
None of the air bags
have been deployed.

06:52.910 --> 06:55.629
A crash like this, they
all should've inflated.

06:55.680 --> 06:57.648
Unless someone overrode
the controls of the vehicle.

06:57.680 --> 07:00.774
You saying you think someone
hacked it and made it crash?

07:00.820 --> 07:02.811
WATSON:
Well, we've all seen the
videos on the Internet.

07:02.850 --> 07:05.887
I mean, new cars like this
are vulnerable to hacking.

07:05.920 --> 07:07.888
Analysis
of the car's onboard computer

07:07.920 --> 07:09.888
will confirm whether I'm right.

07:09.930 --> 07:12.728
But, yeah, I believe
someone hired these two

07:12.760 --> 07:14.523
to carry out the shooting
outside the club,

07:14.560 --> 07:15.925
then took control
of this vehicle

07:15.960 --> 07:17.894
and killed them
in a staged accident

07:17.930 --> 07:19.534
to cover his or her tracks.

07:19.570 --> 07:21.595
So while the triggermen
are dead...

07:26.980 --> 07:28.629
MASON: So this is the code
the NYPD techs

07:28.680 --> 07:30.898
found on the car's computer?

07:30.950 --> 07:33.168
It is.
That's some sweet compression.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.541
It's definitely not native
to the car's computer.

07:35.580 --> 07:38.185
Someone must've overwritten
the factory software.

07:38.220 --> 07:40.051
Your task
is to identify the author.

07:40.090 --> 07:41.955
So the usual deal?

07:41.990 --> 07:42.957
The usual.

07:42.990 --> 07:43.957
You're paying him?

07:43.990 --> 07:45.582
Of course.

07:45.630 --> 07:47.996
I thought all your helpers
worked for free.

07:48.030 --> 07:50.066
No one is compensated in cash.
In Mason's case,

07:50.100 --> 07:51.965
I allow him to sniff your hair
while you're sleeping.

07:53.800 --> 07:55.233
He's joking.

07:55.270 --> 07:56.965
Tell her you're joking.

07:57.010 --> 07:59.604
_ _ Mason craves certain
limited edition action figures,

07:59.640 --> 08:01.232
and I have a friend
who can secure

08:01.280 --> 08:03.805
even the rarest collectible.

08:03.850 --> 08:05.704
I see our two assassins'
fingerprints

08:05.750 --> 08:07.718
were not
in the federal database.

08:07.750 --> 08:09.945
No. The captain's got a team
looking into it.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.878
But, on the bright side,

08:11.920 --> 08:14.855
I found plenty
of information on Zolotov.

08:14.890 --> 08:17.825
_ Turns out he's not
just some random rich guy.

08:17.860 --> 08:19.828
He was one of the richest men
in the world.

08:19.860 --> 08:21.020
Ranked somewhere
in the mid-300$.

08:21.060 --> 08:23.290
One of Russia's
so-called oligarchs.

08:23.330 --> 08:25.867
What's an oligarch?
In Russia's case,

08:25.900 --> 08:28.869
part of an inner circle that
practically owns the country.

08:28.900 --> 08:30.868
So Zolotov made his
money in shipping.

08:30.910 --> 08:33.674
He was a close personal friend
of the Russian president.

08:33.710 --> 08:36.133
But according to his critics,
not a nice man.

08:36.180 --> 08:37.738
The oligarchs
are frequently referred to

08:37.780 --> 08:39.748
as_ little more than
billionaire thugs.

08:39.780 --> 08:43.011
Last year, a Polish paper
did a profile on him.

08:43.050 --> 08:45.541
They said that he was a
ruthless negotiator and implied

08:45.590 --> 08:47.558
that he had assassins
on retainer.

08:47.590 --> 08:49.922
So maybe one of the rival
oligarchs had him killed.

08:49.960 --> 08:52.019
I would've thought, if a
Russian wanted him dead,

08:52.060 --> 08:54.028
they would do it in Russia,

08:54.060 --> 08:56.858
where the authorities _can be
relied upon to turn a blind eye.

08:56.900 --> 08:59.596
Perhaps he came to New York
on business, it went poorly,

08:59.640 --> 09:02.700
and someone decided to do unto
him before he did unto them.

09:02.740 --> 09:04.662
So why do you care?

09:05.810 --> 09:06.777
I'm just saying.

09:06.810 --> 09:08.004
I mean, he was a bad guy.

09:08.040 --> 09:09.678
Now he's dead.

09:09.710 --> 09:11.598
We should go see a movie
or something.

09:11.650 --> 09:13.618
The people who killed him
also killed his bodyguard

09:13.650 --> 09:15.948
and the_valet_ who
was getting his car.

09:15.980 --> 09:17.948
HOLMES:
And _even if the_re_were
no innocent Victims,

09:17.990 --> 09:19.958
no murder
should go unsolved,

09:19.990 --> 09:22.151
and no murderer
should walk free.

09:22.190 --> 09:25.921
To think otherwise is to descend
into a pit of moral relatIVIsm.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.129
Speaking of which,

09:29.160 --> 09:31.765
I'd like a word.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.809
So...

09:37.840 --> 09:39.979
what did my father want
when he came here last night?

09:40.010 --> 09:43.798
Let me guess-- you can still
smell his cologne upstairs.

09:43.850 --> 09:45.806
He was here precisely
three minutes, 48 seconds.

09:45.850 --> 09:48.011
Not long enough for that
particular odor to settle.

09:48.050 --> 09:49.711
How do you know
how long he was here?

09:49.750 --> 09:51.638
I recently connected the
brownstone's exterior cameras

09:51.690 --> 09:53.658
to both the doorbell
and the Internet.

09:53.690 --> 09:55.988
Someone pushes the button,
I'm sent a live feed.

09:56.020 --> 09:58.079
So, uh, what did he want?

09:58.130 --> 09:59.688
Nothing.

09:59.730 --> 10:01.755
Nothing...

10:02.930 --> 10:06.661
He invited _me to dinner.
I said yes.

10:06.700 --> 10:09.066
You said I should reevaluate
him, form my own opinion.

10:09.100 --> 10:11.204
I thought this would be
a good opportunity.

10:11.240 --> 10:14.209
I-I've just got...
I have one request.
Hmm?

10:14.240 --> 10:16.208
There are three
survwing Holmes men,

10:16.240 --> 10:18.845
and you've sampled the
carnal wares of one.

10:18.880 --> 10:20.211
Two would be a pattern.

10:20.250 --> 10:21.615
This isn't a date.

10:22.790 --> 10:25.941
You owe _me one
action figure.

10:25.990 --> 10:27.355
I'm thinking
Picard 1701,

10:27.390 --> 10:30.188
"Tapestry" edition.
In its original packaging.

10:30.230 --> 10:32.221
You identified the hacker
already?

10:32.260 --> 10:34.091
I found a signature buried
in some lines of code.

10:34.130 --> 10:36.189
The hacker's signature
is a picture of a cat?

10:36.230 --> 10:39.097
It's not just a picture.
It's an ASCII portrait.

10:39.130 --> 10:40.438
That means you can only
use keyboard characters

10:40.470 --> 10:42.859
to form the image.
Letters, numbers, symbols.

10:42.910 --> 10:44.798
And the signature is an image.

10:44.840 --> 10:46.137
Well, that's just
how she does it.

10:46.170 --> 10:48.104
ll-Shell?
Mittens.

10:48.140 --> 10:50.279
She's the lead programmer
at Pentillion Edge,

10:50.310 --> 10:52.175
that big R & D firm
up in Chelsea.

10:52.210 --> 10:53.746
She posts on coding boards
sometimes.

10:53.780 --> 10:55.748
_ Her real name
is Fiona something,

10:55.780 --> 10:58.044
but everybody calls her Mittens
'cause she's really into cats.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.910
Weird enough to have taken
several lives last night?

11:01.960 --> 11:04.656
She likes cats, so... sure.

11:08.030 --> 11:10.863
WATSON: Driverless cars.
Hyperloop trains.

11:10.900 --> 11:12.731
Rockets to colonize space.

11:12.770 --> 11:14.761
Pentillion _is_
certainly ambitious.

11:14.800 --> 11:18.065
They chase "moonshots."

11:18.110 --> 11:21.136
It's the current tech-speak
for technologies which,

11:21.180 --> 11:24.240
if brought to fruition, could
literally change the world.

11:24.280 --> 11:26.475
MAN:
Or take us to a new one.

11:26.510 --> 11:28.341
Hi. Phil Balsam.

11:28.380 --> 11:30.382
VPofR&D.

11:32.050 --> 11:33.756
Uh, sorry about the video--

11:33.790 --> 11:35.849
it's a little
self-congratulatory.

11:35.890 --> 11:37.755
Uh, we're here to
see Fiona Helbron,

11:37.790 --> 11:39.257
aka Mittens.

11:39.290 --> 11:42.157
Yes, my secretary told me--
she said you were the police.

11:42.200 --> 11:44.760
Would you mind telling me
why you want to see Fiona?

11:44.800 --> 11:47.268
Actually, we're here to discuss
her role in five murders.

11:47.300 --> 11:49.495
WATSON: She wrote some
sobeare that was used

11:49.540 --> 11:51.360
to take control of a car
last night,

11:51.410 --> 11:52.900
that caused a fatal accident.

11:52.940 --> 11:54.339
You're kidding.

11:54.380 --> 11:57.269
Can you take us
to her or not?

11:57.310 --> 11:59.278
Yes, of course.

11:59.310 --> 12:01.141
But, uh...
but trust me,

12:01.180 --> 12:03.011
she wouldn't hurt anybody;
she couldn't.

12:03.050 --> 12:05.883
Well, you might be able to send
a rocket into orbit, Mr. Balsam,

12:05.920 --> 12:08.013
but please don't presume to know
what's in your employee's heart.

12:08.060 --> 12:11.120
You don't understand--
I... I know what's in her head.

12:11.160 --> 12:14.049
When I say she
can't hurt anyone, I mean it.

12:16.200 --> 12:17.963
They say autism
is a spectrum,

12:18.000 --> 12:20.298
but it's really an array
of different conditions

12:20.340 --> 12:21.864
all lumped together.

12:21.900 --> 12:23.959
I prefer the term
"neuroatypical,"

12:24.010 --> 12:25.432
because... it's
more accurate.

12:25.470 --> 12:27.335
My brain is different
than yours.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.871
I'm atypical-- NA.

12:29.910 --> 12:31.104
Phil is NT—-
neurotypical.

12:31.150 --> 12:33.345
She's NT, too.

12:35.020 --> 12:37.215
I'm not sure what you are.

12:37.250 --> 12:40.856
Social interactions are, uh...
difficult for you, are they?

12:40.890 --> 12:42.050
I'm better when
I write things down,

12:42.090 --> 12:44.058
'cause I can
just fix them later.

12:44.090 --> 12:45.387
I can make the code work.

12:45.430 --> 12:47.421
I like it when the code works.

12:49.100 --> 12:52.194
Do me a favor--
tell me the slq is green.

12:52.230 --> 12:53.891
But it's not. It's blue.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.192
To be more accurate,
it appears blue

12:56.240 --> 12:58.458
because of diffused
sky radiation.

12:58.510 --> 13:01.502
Yeah. But I'd like you
to tell me it's green,

13:01.540 --> 13:03.804
by way of experiment.

13:05.850 --> 13:08.273
No. I don't want to.

13:12.190 --> 13:14.488
Fiona...

13:14.520 --> 13:16.556
were you involved...

13:16.590 --> 13:19.320
in making this car crash?

13:19.360 --> 13:22.022
The people inside

13:22.060 --> 13:23.869
had just committed
a murder.

13:23.900 --> 13:25.868
The software you wrote
for Pentillion's driverless car

13:25.900 --> 13:27.333
was found

13:27.370 --> 13:28.598
on this car's computer.

13:28.640 --> 13:30.267
No. No.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.266
My code is supposed
to save lives.

13:32.310 --> 13:34.505
Self-driving cars
are safer than normal cars,

13:34.540 --> 13:37.247
and I wouldn't do this,
not ever.

13:39.150 --> 13:41.243
Thank you, Fiona.

13:41.280 --> 13:44.249
You can go back
to work now.

13:48.990 --> 13:51.857
She's the best coder we have.

13:51.890 --> 13:53.323
I wouldn't trade her
for anyone.

13:53.360 --> 13:55.897
And, like I said,
she's... she's not a killer.

13:55.930 --> 13:57.158
HOLMES:
Her condition makes it

13:57.200 --> 13:58.326
virtually impossible
for her to lie,

13:58.370 --> 13:59.621
even about something

13:59.670 --> 14:01.297
as simple as the color
of the sky.

14:01.340 --> 14:02.591
WATSON:
Did anyone else

14:02.640 --> 14:04.437
have access to her software?

14:04.470 --> 14:07.576
A lot of people, unfortunately.

14:07.610 --> 14:10.249
Um, everyone in this office,
our engineers,

14:10.280 --> 14:12.248
fabrication unit.

14:12.280 --> 14:14.373
And not to mention, um...

14:14.420 --> 14:16.342
there was a breach.

14:16.380 --> 14:19.349
We got hacked
a few weeks ago.

14:19.390 --> 14:21.119
They accessed
our proprietary software,

14:21.160 --> 14:22.411
including Fiona's code.

14:22.460 --> 14:24.382
And I didn't think much
about it because...

14:24.430 --> 14:26.079
to tell the truth, it happens

14:26.130 --> 14:28.291
to tech companies more often
than we like to admit,

14:28.330 --> 14:31.299
and usually, the people doing it
are other tech companies.

14:31.330 --> 14:32.888
You steal from each other.

14:32.940 --> 14:34.430
Well, it's been going on
since Steve Jobs

14:34.470 --> 14:36.267
"borrowed" the idea
for the Mac interface

14:36.300 --> 14:37.267
and mouse from Xerox.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.403
This time around,
I'm pretty sure

14:39.440 --> 14:40.998
we were hit by Tetra-Bit.

14:41.040 --> 14:42.200
They make computer hardware.

14:42.240 --> 14:43.571
Did you report the breach?

14:43.610 --> 14:44.941
No. No.

14:44.980 --> 14:47.073
Um... glass houses.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.270
To be honest,
it was probably a reprisal.

14:49.320 --> 14:51.982
About two months ago,
some of our people

14:52.020 --> 14:53.954
wormed their way
into Tetra-Bit's system.

14:53.990 --> 14:56.185
They've started getting
into robotics and automation,

14:56.220 --> 14:58.051
and our guys were...

14:58.090 --> 14:59.955
curious how they were doing.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.695
So you hack them, they hack you.

15:01.730 --> 15:03.027
(chuckles):
It's juvenile, I know,

15:03.070 --> 15:04.628
but it's part of the culture.

15:04.670 --> 15:06.023
WATSON:
Has Pentillion
done business

15:06.070 --> 15:08.129
with Maxim Zolotov?

15:08.170 --> 15:10.138
No.

15:10.170 --> 15:12.058
Perhaps he was
one of your investors.

15:12.110 --> 15:13.236
Well, Pentillion was founded

15:13.280 --> 15:14.633
by a group of dot-com
billionaires.

15:14.680 --> 15:16.136
They don't need
outside investors.

15:16.180 --> 15:18.102
All the stock is held by them

15:18.150 --> 15:20.038
and our employees.

15:20.080 --> 15:22.139
If it will
help protect

15:22.180 --> 15:24.045
the company's reputation,
I'm sure they'd be happy

15:24.090 --> 15:26.115
to give you access
to our corporate records.

15:26.150 --> 15:26.787
E-mail. The works.

15:26.820 --> 15:29.948
Thanks. We appreciate that.

15:31.160 --> 15:32.457
Oh, and one more thing.

15:32.490 --> 15:35.550
Um... you might want to talk
to Carol Finelli.

15:35.600 --> 15:37.488
She's the CEO of Tetra-Bit.

15:37.530 --> 15:40.033
When my guys got
into their system,

15:40.070 --> 15:41.992
they grabbed her e-mails,
and I remember them saying

15:42.040 --> 15:44.099
that a bunch of_ them
were in Ru55ian.

15:46.040 --> 15:48.338
On the advice of my lawyers,
I can't comment

15:48.380 --> 15:51.099
on whether anybody from
my company hacked Pentillion.

15:51.150 --> 15:53.118
If you want to avoid a warrant,
Ms. Finelli,

15:53.150 --> 15:54.447
we're gonna need
more than that.

15:54.480 --> 15:57.085
I said we'd cooperate,
and we will.

15:57.120 --> 15:58.985
On the other matter...

15:59.020 --> 16:01.250
I am at liberty to say

16:01.290 --> 16:04.225
I was negotiating a deal
with Maxim Zolotov.

16:04.260 --> 16:06.057
He was preparing
an offer to buy

16:06.090 --> 16:08.593
and renovate the Port
of New Haven in Connecticut.

16:08.630 --> 16:10.166
He approached Tetra-Bit
to provide

16:10.200 --> 16:12.168
the automation _
and the computerization.

16:12.200 --> 16:14.998
The past few months, we were
hammering out the details.

16:15.040 --> 16:17.600
When was the last time
you met With him?
FINELLI: Never.

16:17.640 --> 16:19.733
We did all of our business
by e-mail and phone.

16:19.770 --> 16:21.704
I didn't even know
he was in New York.

16:23.180 --> 16:25.148
This deal would have been worth

16:25.180 --> 16:26.499
billions in
gross profits

16:26.550 --> 16:28.541
over the next ten years.

16:28.580 --> 16:32.118
Enough to bring our entire
robotics division into profit.

16:32.150 --> 16:34.380
And now that he's dead?

16:34.420 --> 16:36.251
The port deal is dead, too.

16:36.290 --> 16:38.520
Take my word--
I am the last person

16:38.560 --> 16:40.528
who would have arranged
his murder.

16:40.560 --> 16:42.699
Let's say we believe you.

16:42.730 --> 16:45.096
Who stood to profit
from Tetra-Bit's loss?

16:46.470 --> 16:48.097
I honestly
can't think of anyone.

16:48.140 --> 16:49.767
There were no competing offers.

16:49.800 --> 16:52.109
Without Zolotov,
the Port of New Haven just...

16:52.140 --> 16:54.472
stays the way it is,
a minor player.

16:54.510 --> 16:56.535
Let me rephrase that.

16:56.580 --> 16:59.071
What if Zolotov was killed
in self-defense

16:59.110 --> 17:01.112
from a financial point of view?

17:01.150 --> 17:04.711
If his deal had gone through...
who had the most to lose?

17:04.750 --> 17:07.457
If you're asking
who would have been hurt

17:07.490 --> 17:10.527
by a massive new port
in Connecticut...

17:10.560 --> 17:12.187
call the governor.

17:12.230 --> 17:14.152
Because the entity
with the most to lose

17:14.200 --> 17:16.259
would have been
the State of New York.

17:22.270 --> 17:24.807
Miss Finelli's suggestion isn't
as ridiculous as it sounds.

17:24.840 --> 17:26.637
You think the State
of New York took out a hit

17:26.670 --> 17:28.479
on a Russian
oligarch?

17:28.510 --> 17:31.149
Not the State as such, but a
great many people rely on income

17:31.180 --> 17:32.841
from the Ports of New York
and New Jersey.

17:32.880 --> 17:34.848
Any number of entities
would have been hurt

17:34.880 --> 17:36.643
by Zolotov's
Connecticut project.

17:36.680 --> 17:38.409
Port employees,
cargo handling companies.

17:38.450 --> 17:39.747
Dock workers.

17:42.220 --> 17:43.687
Hey, do you have
that witness information

17:43.730 --> 17:45.129
from the crime
scene handy?

17:45.160 --> 17:46.320
Yeah.

17:46.360 --> 17:48.521
We got this from the
last guy we spoke to.

17:48.560 --> 17:49.697
BELL:
Harry Magarac.

17:49.730 --> 17:51.266
He's the president

17:51.300 --> 17:54.167
of the Port of New York's
docloNorkers' union.

17:56.470 --> 17:59.166
GREGSON: Pretty big coincidence,
you just happening to be

17:59.210 --> 18:02.099
on the scene for the
assassmation of the guy

18:02.140 --> 18:05.200
who threatened the livelihood
of his union members.

18:06.850 --> 18:10.445
And here I thought we were
having a pleasant conversation.

18:10.490 --> 18:12.287
You accusing me of something?

18:12.320 --> 18:14.288
BELL: Look, you have
15 known members

18:14.320 --> 18:17.118
of the Coretto crime family
on your union rolls,

18:17.160 --> 18:19.583
and the strip club is owned
by one of their associates.

18:19.630 --> 18:21.291
The Mafia?

18:21.330 --> 18:22.797
Somebody's been watching
too many movies.

18:22.830 --> 18:24.866
You rub shoulders with mobsters.

18:24.900 --> 18:27.289
You and your union
both have a record

18:27.340 --> 18:30.138
for resorting to violence
to get things done.

18:30.170 --> 18:32.707
BELL: During the strike
of 2011, you led an attack

18:32.740 --> 18:36.130
in which dockworkers armed with
baseball bats severely damaged

18:36.180 --> 18:38.148
a grain export facility.

18:38.180 --> 18:39.647
You pled no contest.

18:39.680 --> 18:41.648
Okay, you're right.

18:41.680 --> 18:43.648
It's no coincidence
that me and Zolotov were

18:43.690 --> 18:46.648
at the club at the same time,
but I didn't have him killed.

18:46.690 --> 18:48.282
We were cutting a deal.

18:49.520 --> 18:51.226
Look, that grain
terminal thing aside,

18:51.260 --> 18:52.852
young kids today,
they don't want

18:52.890 --> 18:54.528
to go to war
for their jobs.

18:54.560 --> 18:57.165
Millennials, they're all,
"Live and let live."

18:57.200 --> 19:00.795
So when I heard about
Zolotov's port project,

19:00.840 --> 19:03.331
I contacted him to see
if we could come to terms.

19:03.370 --> 19:04.564
What was the deal?

19:04.610 --> 19:08.478
Zolotov guaranteed
any of my guys lost work

19:08.510 --> 19:10.478
first crack at the new jobs
in Connecticut.

19:10.510 --> 19:12.307
Plus he promised to make
a fat contribution

19:12.350 --> 19:13.772
to our health and welfare fund.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.311
In exchange for which
we use our influence

19:16.350 --> 19:18.318
to move his port deal forward.

19:18.350 --> 19:20.614
We were at the club to work out
the final details.

19:20.660 --> 19:23.254
I don't suppose you can
prove any of this.

19:23.290 --> 19:27.420
Here's an e-mail from my private
banker in the Caymans confirming

19:27.460 --> 19:31.294
that he deposited
100 grand into my account.

19:31.330 --> 19:33.332
Consulting fee.

19:33.370 --> 19:34.962
That's just a down payment.
I stood to see

19:35.000 --> 19:36.797
five times that much
once the deal was done.

19:39.340 --> 19:43.344
Look, I might be old-school,
I know a couple of wiseguys.

19:43.380 --> 19:45.348
I'm not stupid enough
to kill the Russian goose

19:45.380 --> 19:47.348
that lays the golden egg.

19:47.380 --> 19:51.441
Especially when he's standing
20 feet away from me.

19:51.490 --> 19:53.856
There's one more thing
you should know.

19:53.890 --> 19:56.279
Me and Zolotov never
finished our busmess.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.925
His bodyguard got spooked
by one of the strippers.

19:58.960 --> 20:00.325
Spooked by a stripper?

20:00.360 --> 20:02.351
Something about her
bothered him.

20:02.400 --> 20:03.799
Him and Zolotov
talked in Russian,

20:03.830 --> 20:06.492
the two of them took off...

20:06.530 --> 20:08.532
ran right into an ambush.

20:10.870 --> 20:12.758
WATSON:
So did you believe Magarac?

20:12.810 --> 20:14.675
Everything he told us
checked out.

20:14.710 --> 20:17.679
Far as we could tell, he was in
the same boat as Carol Finelli.

20:17.710 --> 20:19.940
They both lost out big
when Zolotov was killed.

20:19.980 --> 20:21.641
What about you guys?
You said you found

20:21.680 --> 20:23.318
the hotel where
Zolotov was staying?

20:23.350 --> 20:25.682
We did, and they were kind
enough to grant us access

20:25.720 --> 20:28.450
to the security camera footage
recorded during his time there.

20:28.490 --> 20:29.980
As it turns out,

20:30.020 --> 20:33.695
this woman visited five times
in the last four days.

20:33.730 --> 20:35.027
Those are
armed guards.

20:35.060 --> 20:36.459
I think she's Yakuza.

20:36.500 --> 20:38.422
He's had too
much caffeine,

20:38.470 --> 20:39.869
but the security would suggest
she's someone powerful.

20:39.900 --> 20:42.368
We wondered if Zolotov
was killed over business.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.664
This woman looks all business.
WATSON: Problem is we don't
know who she is.

20:44.710 --> 20:46.837
She never gave
her name at the hotel.

20:46.870 --> 20:49.338
So they ask me to come over
and run her face

20:49.380 --> 20:50.677
through my home-brew
facial recognition sobeare.

20:50.710 --> 20:53.349
Is anything
this kid's doing legal?

20:53.380 --> 20:55.371
Define "legal."

20:55.420 --> 20:57.581
What about the stripper
that Magarac mentioned,

20:57.620 --> 21:00.043
the one that Zolotov and his
bodyguard were spooked by?

21:00.090 --> 21:01.682
Have you identified her?

21:01.720 --> 21:03.529
BELL: Magarac said she
was leggy and brunette,

21:03.560 --> 21:05.585
which I got to think describes
more than a few girls

21:05.630 --> 21:07.291
at that club.

21:07.330 --> 21:08.752
IfI had to guess,
she's an ex-girlfriend

21:08.800 --> 21:10.768
he didn't feel like talking to,
but the timing is weird.

21:10.800 --> 21:13.769
He spots her, leaves, and then
seconds later he's dead?

21:13.800 --> 21:16.291
The club is my next stop
if you guys want to join.

21:16.340 --> 21:17.329
Uh, I'll go.

21:19.610 --> 21:23.341
Uh, I mean, if it'll help
solve a murder.

21:23.380 --> 21:24.574
You two go.

21:24.610 --> 21:26.578
As much as I love
strip clubs,

21:26.610 --> 21:28.419
I have a dinner
to get ready for.

21:28.450 --> 21:30.543
*

21:32.620 --> 21:34.986
* Hold me

21:35.020 --> 21:37.989
* And never let go...

21:38.030 --> 21:39.622
HOLMES:
You look uncomfortable.

21:39.660 --> 21:41.457
Not a fan of this sort
of establishment?

21:41.500 --> 21:43.491
BELL:
Guess I just know too much?

21:43.530 --> 21:45.669
HOLMES: I've got a certain
appreciation for strippers.

21:45.700 --> 21:48.498
I like watching
them work.

21:48.540 --> 21:50.508
Well, in their own way,
they're experts

21:50.540 --> 21:53.532
in both deduction
and human psychology.

21:55.810 --> 21:59.473
Observe how she's evaluating
the pool of potential marks.

21:59.510 --> 22:01.819
Which patrons will yield the
most money for the least effort?

22:03.420 --> 22:04.739
Right, she's
selected that man,

22:04.790 --> 22:07.088
likely because of
his wristwatch,

22:07.120 --> 22:09.088
which denotes a certain
financial status.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.951
Now she's got to
tailor her approach.

22:10.990 --> 22:12.457
Does he want a damsel
in distress?

22:12.490 --> 22:13.889
Does he want
a good-time girl?

22:13.930 --> 22:15.488
Does he want a romantic,

22:15.530 --> 22:17.498
lost soul?

22:18.630 --> 22:20.598
Good-time girl.

22:20.640 --> 22:21.959
(chuckles)

22:22.000 --> 22:23.706
You and I are like

22:23.740 --> 22:25.958
well-informed spectators
at a magic show.

22:26.010 --> 22:28.433
We know the, uh, truth
behind the illusion,

22:28.480 --> 22:30.448
and for you,
that ruins the appeal.

22:30.480 --> 22:33.415
But I enjoy watching an expert
practice sleight of hand,

22:33.450 --> 22:35.111
even when I know
what's up her sleeve.

22:35.150 --> 22:37.414
You see any sleeves
on these girls?

22:37.450 --> 22:38.781
I just wish Magarac
had given us

22:38.820 --> 22:40.617
a better description
of the girl he saw.

22:40.660 --> 22:41.957
I'm gonna go badger
the manager.

22:41.990 --> 22:45.687
If you forebear
for just a moment...

22:50.530 --> 22:52.498
Hello.

22:52.530 --> 22:54.896
Might I trouble you
for a private dance?

22:54.940 --> 22:56.828
My pleasure.

22:56.870 --> 22:58.531
Follow me.

23:01.680 --> 23:03.807
Shan't be a moment.

23:15.690 --> 23:19.023
So... how do you like it?

23:19.060 --> 23:22.154
Sweet or spicy?

23:22.200 --> 23:25.465
Or... maybe both?

23:25.500 --> 23:27.536
That won't
be necessary.

23:28.900 --> 23:30.868
I don't understand.

23:30.910 --> 23:33.572
My name is Sherlock Holmes.
I'm a, um,

23:33.610 --> 23:35.669
detective, but
what's germane

23:35.710 --> 23:38.941
to this conversation is your
identity, your real name, yes.

23:38.980 --> 23:40.914
Olga Berezhnaya.

23:40.950 --> 23:45.580
And to put it bluntly,
you're a Russian spy.

23:46.920 --> 23:49.480
This is role-play, yes?

23:49.520 --> 23:51.454
I like it.

23:51.490 --> 23:53.219
I'm a spy,
and you're the police.

23:53.260 --> 23:55.023
You can drop the pretense.

23:55.060 --> 23:56.925
I've seen your dossier
in London.

23:56.960 --> 24:00.020
So you can just...
answer my questions,

24:00.070 --> 24:02.197
and I won't call my friends
in American intelligence

24:02.240 --> 24:03.935
and tell them all about you.

24:03.970 --> 24:05.528
Promise.

24:08.910 --> 24:11.470
You're here about Zolotov?

24:11.510 --> 24:14.775
Mm-hmm.
You should know
he was not my a55ignment.

24:14.820 --> 24:17.846
I'm supposed to be,
uh, getting friendly

24:17.890 --> 24:21.018
with a foreign dignitary
who frequents this club.

24:21.060 --> 24:22.789
You just stumbled
upon a Russian oligarch

24:22.820 --> 24:24.685
in the course of your duties?

24:26.030 --> 24:29.124
He came in with a man
named Harry Magarac.

24:29.160 --> 24:32.027
Harry's a regular,
friend of the owners.

24:32.070 --> 24:33.958
I recognized Zolotov,
and I thought

24:34.000 --> 24:35.592
my superiors might want to know

24:35.640 --> 24:37.039
what he and Harry
were discussing.

24:37.070 --> 24:38.628
So you listened in?

24:38.670 --> 24:40.809
It was a matter
of little consequence.

24:40.840 --> 24:42.705
Business.

24:42.740 --> 24:44.674
But Yuri, Zolotov's bodyguard--

24:44.710 --> 24:46.871
he was former
Federal Protective Service.

24:46.910 --> 24:50.539
We were in a training exercise
together five years ago.

24:50.590 --> 24:52.512
He made me and warned Zolotov.

24:52.550 --> 24:55.519
_If Zolotov wasn_'t
your a55ignment, why did he run?

24:55.560 --> 24:57.858
I think he didn't want
his friends in Moscow

24:57.890 --> 25:00.256
to hear that he was working
on another deal

25:00.290 --> 25:02.599
while he was supposed to be
on the mission for them.

25:02.630 --> 25:04.621
He was on a mission
for the Kremlin?

25:04.670 --> 25:06.922
From what I could gather,
he was in the US.

25:06.970 --> 25:09.598
to conduct some sort of secret,
backdoor diplomacy.

25:09.640 --> 25:13.098
I don't know the details, but
if that's what got him killed,

25:13.140 --> 25:14.801
there will be consequences.

25:16.640 --> 25:19.074
(crowd chatter,
piano playing)

25:19.110 --> 25:21.943
Mmm. I don't care
what Sherlock says.

25:21.980 --> 25:23.982
This food is not just fuel.

25:24.020 --> 25:27.683
Tomorrow, you'll have
to tell Sherlock what he missed.

25:29.190 --> 25:31.078
Are you all right?
You're barely eating.

25:31.130 --> 25:33.086
Oh, I had a late lunch.

25:33.130 --> 25:35.724
This dish
reminds me of one

25:35.760 --> 25:38.160
I once enjoyed
at Le Val Gielgud,

25:38.200 --> 25:41.658
one of Mycroft's
first restaurants.

25:41.700 --> 25:43.759
I'm quite aware
he's alive, Joan.

25:43.810 --> 25:45.664
Also aware
that he's under

25:45.710 --> 25:48.099
the protection
of American intelligence.

25:48.140 --> 25:49.778
Sherlock told you.

25:51.050 --> 25:52.847
Oh, I have my ways.

25:52.880 --> 25:54.871
It's my understanding

25:54.920 --> 25:57.115
that you were quite close.

25:57.150 --> 25:59.118
For a little while.

25:59.150 --> 26:01.357
Have you heard from him?

26:01.390 --> 26:03.051
Not for some time, no.

26:03.090 --> 26:05.786
But I understand
why it must be.

26:05.830 --> 26:08.754
I respect the choice he made.

26:08.800 --> 26:11.598
I have to admit,

26:11.630 --> 26:14.758
I wondered if that's why
you came to New York.

26:14.800 --> 26:17.837
He's gone, so you want to mend
your relationship with Sherlock.

26:20.710 --> 26:23.235
There was another matter I was
hoping to discuss With you.

26:23.280 --> 26:27.239
For some time now, I've
been banking my own blood

26:27.280 --> 26:29.612
for emergencies,

26:29.650 --> 26:33.950
and I found a local facility
that provides the service.

26:33.990 --> 26:37.824
I was hoping,
given your medical background,

26:37.860 --> 26:41.648
that I could impose upon you
to evaluate it for me.

26:41.700 --> 26:44.999
Sure. I'd be happy to.

26:45.030 --> 26:48.796
Oh. Shall we endeavor
another course?

26:50.170 --> 26:52.161
Absolutely.

26:58.110 --> 27:00.078
(sighs)
Hey.

27:00.110 --> 27:03.238
You leaving?
Yeah. You should, too.

27:03.280 --> 27:04.713
What's wrong?
Did something happen?

27:04.750 --> 27:06.183
The search was taking forever,

27:06.220 --> 27:08.757
so I checked my program log,
and I got back-traced.

27:08.790 --> 27:10.724
Not only did I not find
your mystery woman,

27:10.760 --> 27:13.991
but I got my search program
tracked back to your Wi-Fi.

27:14.030 --> 27:16.328
Look, I'm sorry, but I'm out.
Anybody who can do that

27:16.360 --> 27:18.669
isn't someone I want
to be messmg With.

27:18.700 --> 27:20.327
Well, What are Sherlock and I
supposed to do?

27:20.370 --> 27:21.860
Smash your computers
With a hammer,

27:21.900 --> 27:23.709
then take a vacation.
A long one.

27:23.740 --> 27:26.334
Mason. Mason?
(phone ringing)

27:26.370 --> 27:27.837
(sighs)

27:27.880 --> 27:29.700
(door opens)

27:29.740 --> 27:32.004
(door closes)
Hey.

27:32.050 --> 27:33.745
Have you and your partner
been trying

27:33.780 --> 27:36.214
to run down a suspect
in the Zolotov shooting?

27:36.250 --> 27:39.447
A woman, Asian, early 40s?

27:39.490 --> 27:42.050
We had someone running
an online search. Why?

27:42.090 --> 27:44.388
You should get down
to the station,

27:44.430 --> 27:46.682
because she's in my office.

27:54.970 --> 27:56.767
I apologize
for all the cloak-and-dagger,

27:56.800 --> 27:58.859
but under the circumstances,
it was necessary.

27:58.910 --> 28:00.901
My name is...
HOLMES:
Cindy Park.

28:00.940 --> 28:02.476
You are the US.
State Department's

28:02.510 --> 28:03.909
Undersecretary
for European Affairs.

28:03.950 --> 28:05.474
Earlier this evening,

28:05.510 --> 28:06.875
Detective Bell
and I learned

28:06.910 --> 28:08.172
that Maxim Zolotov
was conducting

28:08.220 --> 28:10.017
business on behalf
of the Russian government.

28:10.050 --> 28:12.939
May we assume that you were
his secret negotiating partner?

28:12.990 --> 28:15.288
Correct, on all counts.

28:15.320 --> 28:17.720
We were trying
to hammer out an agreement

28:17.760 --> 28:19.159
to end
the Russian/Ukrainian war.

28:19.190 --> 28:20.487
GREGSON:
Zolotov was representing

28:20.530 --> 28:21.895
the ethnic Russian rebels

28:21.930 --> 28:23.192
and the Russian government,

28:23.230 --> 28:25.369
and the undersecretary
was negotiating

28:25.400 --> 28:27.766
on behalf of
the Ukrainians.

28:27.800 --> 28:29.165
WATSON:
So you thought his
death was related

28:29.200 --> 28:30.963
to the peace talks,
but you couldn't say so,

28:31.010 --> 28:32.363
because you were worried

28:32.410 --> 28:34.332
that it might jeopardize
your diplomatic efforts.

28:34.380 --> 28:36.029
GREGSON:
Turns out
State has been

28:36.080 --> 28:38.969
discreetly monitoring
our investigation.

28:39.010 --> 28:41.012
Using the NSA to spy on us,
no doubt.

28:41.050 --> 28:42.415
We were hoping you were right

28:42.450 --> 28:44.247
and he was killed
due to the port deal.

28:44.290 --> 28:46.019
Unfortunately, our
own investigation

28:46.050 --> 28:48.359
found something
completely different.

28:50.020 --> 28:52.079
The men who killed Zolotov.

28:52.130 --> 28:54.928
_ You weren't able
to identify them, but we were.

28:54.960 --> 28:57.861
Vasyl Melnyk
and Orest Mishchenko.

28:57.900 --> 28:59.765
Ex-Ukrainian military.

28:59.800 --> 29:02.530
They're suspected in a dozen
hits all over Eastern Europe.

29:02.570 --> 29:04.902
Ukrainians.
PARK:
The war has brought

29:04.940 --> 29:07.773
the Ukrainian government a
massive increase in foreign aid.

29:07.810 --> 29:10.131
It could be they don't
want that to end,

29:10.180 --> 29:11.807
but they need to
keep up their image

29:11.850 --> 29:13.408
as victims of_
Ru55ian aggre55ion.

29:13.450 --> 29:15.077
WATSON: They sent
these two men

29:15.120 --> 29:17.270
to assassinate
the Ru55ian's peace envoy

29:17.320 --> 29:19.914
and then killed them
to cover up their involvement?

29:19.950 --> 29:21.315
HOLMES: Why would
the Ukrainian government

29:21.360 --> 29:24.454
hire hit men whose nationality,
once determined,

29:24.490 --> 29:26.185
would cast suspicion their way?

29:26.230 --> 29:28.824
And-and Why would they kill them
so close to the crime scene?

29:28.860 --> 29:30.828
You're assuming the Ukrainians
are competent,

29:30.870 --> 29:32.269
Which is very much in question.

29:32.300 --> 29:34.165
But you're right--
they might have been framed.

29:34.200 --> 29:36.191
By Whom?

29:36.240 --> 29:37.935
The undersecretary's
not at liberty to say.

29:37.970 --> 29:39.335
She's only told us this much

29:39.370 --> 29:40.803
because she wants us
to drop the matter.

29:40.840 --> 29:43.308
Due to the sensitive
diplomatic Situation,

29:43.340 --> 29:44.978
federal agents
Will be taking over

29:45.010 --> 29:46.204
_the Z_olot_ov
investigation.

29:46.250 --> 29:47.808
We appreciate
your hard work

29:47.850 --> 29:49.477
and your understanding,

29:49.520 --> 29:50.942
but we'll take it from here.

29:59.430 --> 30:01.853
Hey, is this everything?

30:01.900 --> 30:03.891
(speaking Ukrainian)

30:05.900 --> 30:06.889
Was that Ukrainian?

30:06.930 --> 30:08.488
Might have been.

30:08.540 --> 30:10.838
Did it have anything to do
With the Zolotov case?

30:10.870 --> 30:12.838
'Cause we're supposed
to be done with that.

30:12.870 --> 30:15.134
No, you, a policeman with orders
from above, are done with it.

30:15.180 --> 30:16.579
Watson and I
are private Citizens

30:16.610 --> 30:18.840
and can do in our free time
as we Wish.

30:18.880 --> 30:20.848
Now, please give
our case materials

30:20.880 --> 30:22.871
to the undersecretary
With my kindest regards.

30:25.920 --> 30:27.888
(sighs)
You getting anywhere?

30:29.460 --> 30:31.985
Ms. Park acknowledged
the possibility

30:32.030 --> 30:33.850
the Ukrainian government
was being framed.

30:33.900 --> 30:35.424
This suggests
a third party

30:35.460 --> 30:37.155
Who wants to keep
the war going.

30:37.200 --> 30:39.919
Now, ask yourself, who profits
most in times of war?

30:39.970 --> 30:42.188
Arms dealers.

30:42.240 --> 30:44.037
Weapons are one of
the United States'

30:44.070 --> 30:45.435
most profitable
exports.

30:45.470 --> 30:47.335
And, indeed, American
ethnic communities

30:47.370 --> 30:49.406
have a long tradition
of sending weapons

30:49.440 --> 30:51.078
to their war-torn
homelands.

30:51.110 --> 30:53.874
Let me guess-- it's happening
With Ukraine, too?

30:53.920 --> 30:55.911
The Ukrainians have even gone
so far as to send

30:55.950 --> 30:57.884
dedicated fund-raisers
to the United States.

30:57.920 --> 31:00.445
I just got off the phone
With someone

31:00.490 --> 31:02.913
Who gave me a list
of American arms dealers

31:02.960 --> 31:05.155
most active in
the Ukrainian conflict.

31:05.190 --> 31:06.179
Just like that?

31:06.230 --> 31:07.925
I might have posed

31:07.960 --> 31:10.190
as a wealthy
Ukrainian-American businessman

31:10.230 --> 31:12.095
interested in
helping the cause.

31:12.130 --> 31:13.427
Point of fact is,
they confirmed

31:13.470 --> 31:15.165
a list I'd already
compiled myself.

31:15.200 --> 31:18.101
Okay. Officially,
I don't want to know about it.

31:18.140 --> 31:19.937
Unofficially, I'm worried
about What happens

31:19.970 --> 31:21.972
When the Feds' theory
about the Ukrainians

31:22.010 --> 31:23.272
gets back to the Russians.

31:23.310 --> 31:24.948
There could be reprisals,

31:24.980 --> 31:27.676
more deaths, less peace.

31:27.710 --> 31:29.519
So maybe you can give them
a better theory,

31:29.550 --> 31:31.142
Whether they want
to hear it or not?

31:31.190 --> 31:33.181
Watson is, at this very moment,

31:33.220 --> 31:35.017
having a chat With someone

31:35.060 --> 31:38.427
With a passing familiarity
With arms dealers.

31:41.500 --> 31:44.025
(door opens)

31:44.070 --> 31:45.924
Joan?

31:45.970 --> 31:47.494
I didn't expect to hear back

31:47.530 --> 31:50.465
from you so quickly.

31:50.500 --> 31:52.365
Shall I send for more food?

31:52.410 --> 31:54.469
I'm good, thanks,
and to be honest, um,

31:54.510 --> 31:56.068
the blood bank
isn't the only reason

31:56.110 --> 31:57.668
I wanted to speak with you.

31:59.210 --> 32:02.316
So, I looked into that facility
you asked about.

32:02.350 --> 32:05.979
It's adequate,
but I think you can do better.

32:06.020 --> 32:07.954
This company
pioneered autologous

32:07.990 --> 32:10.083
blood banking
and can keep several pints

32:10.120 --> 32:12.623
on hand
for up to ten years.

32:12.660 --> 32:14.594
They also work
With local hospitals to ensure

32:14.630 --> 32:17.224
that you'll receive
your own blood when you need it.

32:17.260 --> 32:19.023
Impressive.

32:19.070 --> 32:20.594
Thanks.

32:20.630 --> 32:22.336
Of course.

32:22.370 --> 32:25.339
And the other reason
you wanted to speak to me?

32:27.270 --> 32:29.977
Can you tell me
Which of these arms dealers

32:30.010 --> 32:31.978
is making the most money

32:32.010 --> 32:34.376
off the Russian/Ukrainian
conflict?

32:37.380 --> 32:40.087
You know What they say--
war is good for business.

32:40.120 --> 32:42.088
So you don't deny
selling weapons to both

32:42.120 --> 32:44.088
the Ukrainians
and the Russians?

32:44.130 --> 32:45.984
I sold weapons

32:46.030 --> 32:48.021
to the Ukrainians,
but not the Russians.

32:48.060 --> 32:50.995
Russians make perfectly
good ones on their own.

32:51.030 --> 32:54.431
I sold them computer parts
and electronics.

32:54.470 --> 32:57.166
For drones_ _
and long-range missﬂes.

32:57.200 --> 32:58.337
I don't know where they end up.

32:58.370 --> 33:00.008
I just know
they bought a lot of them.

33:00.040 --> 33:01.132
WATSON:
According to our sources,

33:01.180 --> 33:02.374
you used to work for the CIA.

33:02.410 --> 33:04.139
So your contacts in DC.

33:04.180 --> 33:06.000
could've told you
about Zolotov's mission.

33:06.050 --> 33:07.369
You also have friends
Who could've

33:07.410 --> 33:09.776
gotten you
Pentillion's software.

33:09.820 --> 33:12.186
Means and motive,
Mr. Soble.

33:12.220 --> 33:14.381
Means, yes.

33:14.420 --> 33:16.615
But you couldn't be
more wrong about motive.

33:16.660 --> 33:19.128
Did I know Zolotov was trying
a little backdoor diplomacy?

33:19.160 --> 33:22.049
Yeah, but I didn't kill him.

33:22.100 --> 33:25.399
The fact is I had every reason
to hope that he'd succeed.

33:25.430 --> 33:27.421
You just said war
was good for your business.

33:27.470 --> 33:29.062
War's good
for selling.

33:29.100 --> 33:30.590
Peace is Where you cash in.

33:30.640 --> 33:32.130
Especially in this situation.

33:32.170 --> 33:35.037
See, the Russians paid me
completely in rubles.

33:35.080 --> 33:37.139
Deposited in an account
in Moscow.

33:37.180 --> 33:40.377
But the US. and the EU. had
leveled sanctions against them

33:40.410 --> 33:42.617
because they were messing around
in the Ukraine.

33:42.650 --> 33:44.618
Including restricting
their exports.

33:44.650 --> 33:46.538
So the value of the ruble
took a big hit.

33:46.590 --> 33:48.478
So you want the war to end

33:48.520 --> 33:50.579
so the ruble will rise enough
for you to cash in.

33:50.620 --> 33:52.178
What about the
Ukrainians?

33:52.230 --> 33:53.481
Surely your business
With them comprises

33:53.530 --> 33:55.293
the lion's share _
of your war profiteering.

33:55.330 --> 33:57.093
Sure, I sold them
a lot of product.

33:57.130 --> 33:58.825
ButI haven't gotten paid.

33:58.870 --> 34:01.065
Ukrainians are cash poor.
My friends in DC.

34:01.100 --> 34:04.160
encouraged me to sell weapons
to them on credit.

34:04.210 --> 34:06.064
I haven't seen a penny yet.

34:06.110 --> 34:07.805
War goes on much longer,

34:07.840 --> 34:10.229
the Ukrainians are gonna
default on their debts.

34:10.280 --> 34:11.474
I'll end up writing off

34:11.510 --> 34:13.205
everything
I sold them as a loss.

34:13.250 --> 34:15.468
Is that arrangement typical
for people in your line of work?

34:15.520 --> 34:17.169
Every war is different.

34:17.220 --> 34:19.313
That's just the way
this one broke down.

34:19.350 --> 34:21.489
Anybody Who sold to the Russians
or the Ukrainians

34:21.520 --> 34:24.125
is in the same boat that I am.

34:24.160 --> 34:26.549
So who stands to profit
if the war continues?

34:26.590 --> 34:28.194
Dutch natural gas,

34:28.230 --> 34:29.697
Azerbaijani caviar,

34:29.730 --> 34:31.163
Polish vodka,

34:31.200 --> 34:32.394
Norwegian lumber.

34:32.430 --> 34:35.194
The folks Who make money
are the ones

34:35.240 --> 34:36.491
Who provide
an alternative source

34:36.540 --> 34:38.235
for the things
the Russians can't export

34:38.270 --> 34:39.635
because of the sanctions.

34:43.210 --> 34:45.576
I know he probably
didn't have Zolotov killed,

34:45.610 --> 34:48.113
but still, When I think
of all the people that died

34:48.150 --> 34:50.118
because of his weapons...

34:50.150 --> 34:53.119
His business is vile, but
legally he's not a murderer.

34:53.150 --> 34:55.380
And he might've just given
us the key to this case.

34:55.420 --> 34:57.285
You're talking
about the sanctions?

34:57.320 --> 34:59.527
It occurred to me the list
of products he gave us

34:59.560 --> 35:01.255
were were not the only
Russian exports

35:01.300 --> 35:02.528
being kept off the market.

35:02.560 --> 35:04.596
I tracked down a more
comprehenswe list,

35:04.630 --> 35:06.621
and that, in turn,
has yielded a suspect.

35:06.670 --> 35:08.661
VVho?
(car horn honks)

35:08.700 --> 35:10.133
Never mind. Sorry.

35:10.170 --> 35:11.831
Suffice it to say,

35:11.870 --> 35:15.135
we won't be taking any
hackable cars for a While.

35:15.180 --> 35:17.330
Come on, I'll explain
on the subway.

35:24.690 --> 35:26.510
(door opens)

35:27.720 --> 35:29.278
Miss Helbron.

35:29.320 --> 35:31.185
Uh, sorry to intrude.

35:31.230 --> 35:34.222
Um... I was hoping
I might have a word.

35:34.260 --> 35:35.659
You have good manners.

35:35.700 --> 35:37.224
You must work hard at them.

35:37.260 --> 35:39.160
Well, I can be
quite rude at times.

35:39.200 --> 35:41.498
You know, when I, uh...
When I fail to make the effort.

35:41.540 --> 35:43.167
I forget sometimes, too.

35:43.200 --> 35:44.633
Especially When I'm working.

35:44.670 --> 35:46.501
It's hard.

35:46.540 --> 35:48.269
How did you find me?

35:48.310 --> 35:50.198
Uh, well, I wanted to speak
With your privately.

35:50.240 --> 35:51.468
I tracked down your residence.

35:51.510 --> 35:53.239
Tried to pay you a visit there.

35:53.280 --> 35:54.542
I don't spend
much time at home.

35:54.580 --> 35:55.877
It's very small.

35:55.920 --> 35:57.342
New York apartments
are very small.

35:57.380 --> 35:58.517
Yeah, they can be

35:58.550 --> 36:00.188
quite restrictive
in other ways, too.

36:00.220 --> 36:02.279
Your building
doesn't allow pets, for example.

36:02.320 --> 36:04.584
Yet, When we met
at Pentillion the other day,

36:04.630 --> 36:07.258
you had, um...
you had cat hair on you

36:07.290 --> 36:09.622
from at least
a dozen different sources.

36:09.660 --> 36:12.390
You don't strike me
as the sort to break the rules.

36:12.430 --> 36:15.331
I concluded that you interacted
With a large number of felines

36:15.370 --> 36:17.258
somewhere other
than your apartment.

36:18.340 --> 36:21.309
This cat cafe is nearby.

36:21.340 --> 36:23.399
You used logic--

36:23.440 --> 36:25.601
a series of if/then
binary decisions

36:25.650 --> 36:27.948
that inevitably led to me.

36:27.980 --> 36:30.346
What did you want to say?

36:30.380 --> 36:32.280
Well, I confess
I'm here to discuss

36:32.320 --> 36:33.639
the uncomfortable subject
of the murders

36:33.690 --> 36:35.419
Which occurred the other day.

36:37.390 --> 36:39.221
More specifically,
I'd like you to help me

36:39.260 --> 36:41.421
apprehend
the person responsible.

36:41.460 --> 36:43.451
(cat meows)

36:51.510 --> 36:53.501
(engine starts)

37:04.450 --> 37:06.281
(beep, tires squealing)

37:20.730 --> 37:22.732
Come on.

37:27.810 --> 37:29.801
Damn it.

37:42.760 --> 37:43.988
Mr. Balsam.

37:44.020 --> 37:45.681
What is this?

37:45.730 --> 37:48.699
_ _ Fiona Helbron
is usmg her software to...

37:48.730 --> 37:50.049
control your car.

37:50.100 --> 37:52.068
Don't worry, she's
a very safe driver.

37:52.100 --> 37:54.398
Much safer than you were
When you crashed a vehicle

37:54.440 --> 37:56.465
containing your hit men.

37:56.500 --> 37:57.467
(chuckles):
Wha...?

37:57.500 --> 37:58.706
What are you talking about?

37:58.740 --> 38:00.560
Rocket engines.

38:00.610 --> 38:03.909
Specifically the ones being
developed by Pentillion Edge.

38:03.940 --> 38:05.942
You deferred a large
portion of your salary

38:05.980 --> 38:07.709
_ for shares
in the endeavor.

38:07.750 --> 38:08.944
If they're a success,

38:08.980 --> 38:11.585
you stand to make
hundreds of millions.

38:11.620 --> 38:12.587
So what?

38:12.620 --> 38:13.814
So that proved to be

38:13.850 --> 38:15.989
a poor decision
on your part.

38:16.020 --> 38:17.954
Your engines
are behind schedule.

38:17.990 --> 38:20.629
They're not yet ready to compete
With the industry standard,

38:20.660 --> 38:22.992
the Russian-made RD180.

38:23.030 --> 38:26.659
An engine which powers every
heavy-lift rocket in the world.

38:26.700 --> 38:29.567
Even those used by NASA
and the US. military.

38:29.600 --> 38:31.659
Luckily for you,
the RD18O is off the market

38:31.710 --> 38:33.598
'cause of the sanctions
against Ru55ia.

38:33.640 --> 38:35.335
And if they last long enough,

38:35.380 --> 38:37.678
the West's stockpile
is gonna run out

38:37.710 --> 38:40.406
just as your engines
hit the market.

38:40.450 --> 38:42.668
Unless the war ends

38:42.720 --> 38:44.745
before you're ready.

38:44.790 --> 38:46.348
Then the Russian engines
Will return

38:46.390 --> 38:48.711
and Pentillion's efforts
Will fail.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.682
_Your shares
Will be worthless.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.786
I'm not sure
how you found out

38:53.830 --> 38:55.525
about Zo_lot_ov's
peace missmn,

38:55.560 --> 38:57.699
but once you thought

38:57.730 --> 39:00.563
it would derail
your ambitions,

39:00.600 --> 39:02.067
you arranged
to have him murdered.

39:02.100 --> 39:04.068
Try and keep the war going.

39:04.100 --> 39:05.863
You can't prove any of that.

39:05.910 --> 39:07.764
But I can.

39:07.810 --> 39:10.108
The phone in your hand
contains an app

39:10.140 --> 39:12.608
that Fiona created
to control cars

39:12.650 --> 39:14.709
loaded with her software.

39:14.750 --> 39:17.514
You just tried to use it
to control your car.

39:17.550 --> 39:18.778
But she stopped you.

39:19.820 --> 39:21.879
Once she has your phone,

39:21.920 --> 39:23.911
she Will retrieve
the app's data

39:23.960 --> 39:26.679
and show that you used it
to send two men to their deaths.

39:29.030 --> 39:30.657
Now, it's too late
to, uh, dispose

39:30.700 --> 39:32.361
of the murder weapon,
I'm afraid.

39:33.730 --> 39:35.937
All right... all right.

39:37.100 --> 39:39.068
Zolotov was scum.

39:39.110 --> 39:41.135
He used intimidation

39:41.170 --> 39:43.138
and assassination
to bUIId his empire.

39:43.180 --> 39:44.704
And the-the Ukrainians,
they were,

39:44.750 --> 39:46.445
they were professional
assassins.

39:46.480 --> 39:49.074
So... so what ifI
killed three bad men?

39:49.120 --> 39:51.680
It was for the greater good.

39:51.720 --> 39:53.915
Pentillion's rocket engines,
they're the first step

39:53.950 --> 39:56.953
towards colonizing
the Moon and Mars.

39:57.990 --> 39:59.457
You hear that, Fiona?

39:59.490 --> 40:00.627
Yes, every word.

40:00.660 --> 40:01.649
Yeah.

40:01.700 --> 40:03.122
Fiona took the liberty

40:03.160 --> 40:04.821
of activating your phone

40:04.870 --> 40:06.792
so she could listen
to our conversation.

40:06.830 --> 40:10.038
She's with the NYPD
and the FBI.

40:10.070 --> 40:12.106
They await our arrival,
and, um,

40:12.140 --> 40:15.906
well, they're no doubt gonna
appreciate your confession.

40:29.860 --> 40:31.589
WATSON:
Hi.

40:31.630 --> 40:33.518
What's this?

40:33.560 --> 40:34.891
It's What I worked on today

40:34.930 --> 40:36.795
While you wrapped up
the Zolotov case.

40:38.100 --> 40:40.568
HOLMES:
Murder in Paris.

40:40.600 --> 40:42.591
From almost two years ago.

40:42.640 --> 40:43.789
French businesswoman

40:45.940 --> 40:47.862
The crime was never solved.

40:47.910 --> 40:49.673
The French police
found five shell casings

40:49.710 --> 40:51.541
but only three bullets.

40:51.580 --> 40:53.969
One in Sabine,
two in the wall behind her.

40:54.010 --> 40:56.240
And what exactly
piqued your interest

40:56.280 --> 40:59.579
in a case two years old
and almost 4,000 miles away?

41:01.660 --> 41:03.252
M_ason left his
faCIal recognition

41:03.290 --> 41:05.053
sobeare on our computers.

41:05.090 --> 41:07.752
I used it to search for pictures
of your father online.

41:07.790 --> 41:09.758
There are almost
no images of him.

41:09.800 --> 41:12.462
But I did find these.

41:17.100 --> 41:19.159
He knew the victim.

41:19.210 --> 41:21.064
I get the impression
they were seeing each other

41:21.110 --> 41:22.509
right up until her death.

41:25.110 --> 41:26.839
You think he had
this woman killed?

41:26.880 --> 41:28.518
No.

41:28.550 --> 41:30.017
So, Why did you search
for these pictures?

41:30.050 --> 41:32.280
I noticed something odd
about your father at dinner.

41:32.320 --> 41:33.981
And then again at his office.

41:34.020 --> 41:35.817
The way he eats.

41:35.860 --> 41:37.987
Small, infrequent bites,
thoroughly chewed.

41:38.020 --> 41:39.920
Like someone Who's had
gastric banding,

41:39.960 --> 41:41.621
even though he's
never been obese.

41:41.660 --> 41:43.252
I also noticed

41:43.300 --> 41:44.961
he takes a lot of vitamins,

41:45.000 --> 41:46.661
including high doses of B12,

41:46.700 --> 41:48.861
Which is usually absorbed
through the stomach lining.

41:48.900 --> 41:50.834
You think he's missing
part of his stomach?

41:50.870 --> 41:52.565
At first,
I thought it was cancer.

41:52.610 --> 41:54.259
That's Why I was looking
for pictures of him.

41:54.310 --> 41:55.971
To see if he'd ever
shown Signs

41:56.010 --> 41:58.274
of having been through chemo
or radiation therapy.

41:58.310 --> 42:01.074
Instead, I found Sabine Raoult.

42:03.020 --> 42:05.989
_You think the two bullets
missmg from the crime scene

42:06.020 --> 42:07.783
ended up in my father?

42:07.820 --> 42:09.583
They were hollow points.

42:09.620 --> 42:11.258
One of those could easily
destroy a person's stomach.

42:11.290 --> 42:13.121
It's possible he was
caught in the crossfire

42:13.160 --> 42:14.559
When Sabina was gunned down.

42:14.600 --> 42:16.124
Just like that valet
at the strip club.

42:16.160 --> 42:17.798
But you're not convinced.

42:17.830 --> 42:19.889
At dinner, he asked me
to help him find a place

42:19.930 --> 42:22.763
to bank his own blood
in case of emergency.

42:22.800 --> 42:24.961
Which suggests
another explanation.

42:25.010 --> 42:27.831
I think Sabine
was collateral damage.

42:27.870 --> 42:29.531
Morland was the target.

42:31.010 --> 42:32.602
Someone tried
to kill your father.

42:32.650 --> 42:34.106
And he's worried
they're gonna try again.

42:34.150 --> 42:35.139
