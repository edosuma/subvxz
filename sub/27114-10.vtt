(woman)
Previously on
"Love & Hip Hop..."

00:04.538 --> 00:07.373
We are gonna do
a whole makeover, bitch.

00:07.441 --> 00:09.208
Look, you still got body.

00:09.276 --> 00:10.876
(Jonathan)
Bitch, you look good, girl.

00:10.945 --> 00:12.011
That's not one
of my dresses.

00:12.079 --> 00:13.679
It wasn't popping
for me.

00:13.748 --> 00:15.280
You're wasting
my mother(bleep) time.

00:15.349 --> 00:17.016
You don't wanna do that.

00:17.084 --> 00:18.851
I really miss
your friendship.

00:18.919 --> 00:20.419
Don't say nothing else
to me, how 'bout that?

00:20.488 --> 00:22.988
I exclude myself
from this situation.

00:23.057 --> 00:25.124
I walk away.
Ooh, child.

00:25.192 --> 00:26.825
Nobody's coming at you
like that.
Yes, you are.

00:26.894 --> 00:28.427
What you wanna do?

00:28.496 --> 00:30.696
Nya, we not doing this.
You don't...

00:30.765 --> 00:32.531
You got shot,
for God's sakes,

00:32.600 --> 00:34.666
so I-- know that
that was crazy.

00:34.735 --> 00:36.068
(Maggie)
Something about the crowds.

00:36.137 --> 00:37.302
I just feel
so vulnerable.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.004
Girl, we gotta
get past this.

00:39.073 --> 00:41.673
Right here could have been
the spot that I lost my life.

00:41.742 --> 00:44.176
And that's something that
I think about all the time.

00:44.245 --> 00:46.311
It could have been
that bad.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.347
(Alexis)
I was at lunch with Shottie,

00:48.416 --> 00:50.249
and things just went left.

00:50.317 --> 00:51.750
They started shooting.

00:51.819 --> 00:53.052
I was just thinking
about Alaiya,

00:53.120 --> 00:54.820
'cause you know, a bullet
doesn't have a name to it.

00:54.889 --> 00:57.022
You must not post
everywhere you go.

00:57.091 --> 00:58.624
This is how I make
my money.

00:58.692 --> 01:00.325
I got a bigger surprise.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.294
Daddy's comin' home!

01:02.363 --> 01:04.296
(shouting)

01:04.365 --> 01:06.632
And having you here,
it's a home now.

01:06.700 --> 01:10.202
I definitely wanna be here
for all these moments.

01:12.173 --> 01:15.074
I was charged with
attempted murder first.

01:15.142 --> 01:16.508
So, I gotta go to court.

01:16.577 --> 01:17.876
(Rich)
What happened with the plea?

01:20.114 --> 01:21.947
You gotta be
(bleep) kidding me.

01:22.016 --> 01:23.615
The judge is not trying
to give you probation,

01:23.684 --> 01:24.983
she's trying
to put you in jail.

01:54.315 --> 01:57.249

02:03.023 --> 02:04.656
Have a seat,
little lady.

02:04.725 --> 02:07.759
Thank you.

02:07.828 --> 02:08.927
At the court hearing
the other day,

02:08.996 --> 02:11.163
we all found out
that receiving a plea

02:11.232 --> 02:12.731
is not an option.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.633
Miracle will be headed
to trial

02:14.702 --> 02:16.401
on an aggravated
assault charge,

02:16.470 --> 02:19.638
and could be facing
up to 20 years in prison.

02:19.707 --> 02:21.607
I know it's taking a toll
on Ashley.

02:21.675 --> 02:22.841
How you feel?
You all right?

02:22.910 --> 02:26.245
Yeah, I'm basically
just trying to process.

02:26.313 --> 02:28.580
This is nothing that
we could prepare for.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.782
Like, if she does
have to go away,

02:30.851 --> 02:32.317
like, with the--
the siblings,

02:32.386 --> 02:35.120
like, we need to know what's
gonna happen with them.

02:35.189 --> 02:36.989
There is really a lot
on my plate right now,

02:37.057 --> 02:39.458
and I don't wanna have to,
you know what I'm saying,

02:39.527 --> 02:41.126
end up quitting college,
because--

02:41.195 --> 02:43.529
No, no, no, no, no.
We'll never--
we're not doing that.

02:43.597 --> 02:45.998
I know, but I'm just saying,
if it ever came down to it--
Not doing that.

02:46.066 --> 02:48.634
My family always...
We're not ever
gonna quit college.

02:48.702 --> 02:51.103
I know how close
Ashley is with her siblings.

02:51.172 --> 02:52.838
She just wants to be there
for 'em.

02:52.907 --> 02:54.439
I get it.

02:54.508 --> 02:57.276
But I cannot have her
throwing all that away.

02:57.344 --> 03:00.979
My concern is that,
because you've seen people

03:01.048 --> 03:02.748
put up with things,
doesn't mean

03:02.816 --> 03:05.584
that you should ever
put up with those things.

03:05.653 --> 03:07.352
Right?
It's clear.

03:07.421 --> 03:11.123
You-- that's not happening
with you, ever, in life.

03:11.192 --> 03:13.892
If anyone puts
their hands on you,

03:13.961 --> 03:15.394
you pick up the phone
and you call me.

03:15.462 --> 03:16.895
This is not
no normal (bleep),

03:16.964 --> 03:19.731
and I don't want you
to think that.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.600
We clear?

03:21.669 --> 03:23.235
'Cause I love you,
you mine.

03:23.304 --> 03:25.804
Right?
Right.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.639
It's important.

03:27.708 --> 03:31.076
Why you crying?

03:31.145 --> 03:32.911
Come on, Ashley.

03:32.980 --> 03:35.981
It's just the whole
situation, like...

03:36.050 --> 03:39.017
I...

03:39.086 --> 03:41.853
I've never really ever, like,
just been this emotional.

03:41.922 --> 03:44.323
And-- and I really--
like, Ma, I need her.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.024
Like, we all need her.

03:46.093 --> 03:48.627
All we can do is put all
our resources together

03:48.696 --> 03:50.829
and give your mother
the best defense,

03:50.898 --> 03:52.264
give your mother
the most support

03:52.333 --> 03:53.465
that we can give her.

03:53.534 --> 03:55.534
That's what families do.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.307
What are you doing?

04:02.376 --> 04:04.710
You making cards for Mommy?
Yeah.

04:04.778 --> 04:07.813
It's been amazing being back
in the house with my kids,

04:07.881 --> 04:09.314
Kimbella, my baby.

04:09.383 --> 04:11.183
I know
being here's temporary,

04:11.252 --> 04:12.818
and my up and coming
sentencing

04:12.886 --> 04:14.620
is always
in the back of my mind,

04:14.688 --> 04:16.555
but I'ma soak up
all this quality time

04:16.624 --> 04:18.257
I can get with the family.

04:18.325 --> 04:19.958
Let's make some cards
for Mommy.

04:20.027 --> 04:21.526
Maybe a year ago,
I would have took

04:21.595 --> 04:23.962
a night like this for granted--
watching the kids

04:24.031 --> 04:25.764
while Kimbella's out
with her friends.

04:25.833 --> 04:28.700
But handling my Daddy duties
means the world to me.

04:28.769 --> 04:29.935
I'm gonna make my own card.

04:30.004 --> 04:32.471
Instead of Mommy,
I'ma put "Baby,"

04:32.539 --> 04:33.872
'cause that's my baby.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.540
(laughing)

04:35.609 --> 04:38.710
But I need some ideas
from y'all for our anniversary.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.379
Oh, I know!
What?

04:40.447 --> 04:42.214
Flowers and...

04:42.283 --> 04:45.417
We should get matching
necklaces for Mommy.

04:45.486 --> 04:47.052
One for me
and one for her.

04:47.121 --> 04:48.520
That would be nice, Bella.

04:48.589 --> 04:49.821
Mm-hmm!
You got some money?

04:49.890 --> 04:52.257
Yes.
Oh, you do?

04:52.326 --> 04:54.426
From the tooth fairy!
I didn't use it.

04:54.495 --> 04:56.561
Oh, you got that
tooth fairy money.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.230
Yeah.
Okay, okay, you lit.

04:58.299 --> 04:59.898
What should I get for Mommy?

04:59.967 --> 05:02.067
A ring.
A ring?

05:02.136 --> 05:03.302
Wow, Bella.

05:03.370 --> 05:04.636
Um, get married.

05:04.705 --> 05:06.238
Get married?
Yes.

05:06.307 --> 05:07.606
Juelz say get married.

05:07.675 --> 05:10.208
Yay!
(giggles)

05:10.277 --> 05:11.610
I didn't say
that was happening.

05:11.679 --> 05:13.178
I know, but...

05:13.247 --> 05:15.147
(Juelz)
When it comes
to proposing to Kimbella,

05:15.215 --> 05:16.682
it's something that
I've been wanting to do.

05:16.750 --> 05:19.451
She been riding for me,
she been the love of my life,

05:19.520 --> 05:21.019
and she been the person
that I know

05:21.088 --> 05:22.788
I wanna spend
the rest of my life with.

05:22.856 --> 05:26.191
So, it's long overdue.
Just been dragging my feet.

05:26.260 --> 05:28.794
So, I'ma have to go...

05:28.862 --> 05:30.395
think about
all y'all requests

05:30.464 --> 05:32.431
and your ideas.

05:32.499 --> 05:35.801
Give me a big hug.
Yay!

(Maggie)
Ever since Maino brought me
back to Urban Plaza,

05:53.487 --> 05:56.421
I do feel better,
I feel more confident.

05:56.490 --> 05:58.623
The whole experience
was therapeutic for me,

05:58.692 --> 06:00.759
and it has me thinking
about my whole life,

06:00.828 --> 06:03.462
and my career, and everything
that I wanna pursue.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.163
I'm a business owner.

06:05.232 --> 06:08.867
I own a hair extension company
called Hair Like Maggie.

06:08.936 --> 06:10.869
And today,
I want to talk to Maino

06:10.938 --> 06:14.473
about pursuing something else
outside of my hair shop.

06:14.541 --> 06:17.542
What's up with you?
What--

06:17.611 --> 06:19.111
Now, why would you have
yellow and black on?

06:19.179 --> 06:20.712
I got on yellow and black.

06:20.781 --> 06:22.647
(Maggie)
When I first met Maino,
I was singing.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.683
I was spending time
in the studio.

06:24.752 --> 06:26.251
I was even doing
YouTube videos,

06:26.320 --> 06:28.286
and one got over
a million views.

06:28.355 --> 06:29.755
But after the shooting,

06:29.823 --> 06:31.957
I really couldn't see myself
in large crowds,

06:32.025 --> 06:34.559
couldn't see myself
onstage or anything.

06:34.628 --> 06:36.895
So, music just kinda got
put on hold.

06:36.964 --> 06:39.331
But now, I'm really ready
to try again,

06:39.400 --> 06:40.832
and I just need
Maino's support.

06:40.901 --> 06:44.236
Listen, baby,
you all right?
Hmm, you cool?

06:44.304 --> 06:47.072
I've been, like,
reflecting and...

06:47.141 --> 06:49.641
maybe hopes
of more help

06:49.710 --> 06:52.144
getting over
this PTSD thing.

06:52.212 --> 06:54.780
I was thinking
about possibly,

06:54.848 --> 06:57.482
you know,
doing music again...

06:57.551 --> 06:59.785
and getting on
the stage myself,

06:59.853 --> 07:01.753
and not only just
being at a concert,

07:01.822 --> 07:05.891
but being onstage
at a concert.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.526
You have to be serious
about it

07:07.594 --> 07:09.194
if you saying
that you wanna do it.

07:09.263 --> 07:11.363
But when was I not
serious about it?

07:11.432 --> 07:14.266
Why did you stop?
Because life.

in me enough

07:30.083 --> 07:32.117

07:32.186 --> 07:35.921
What song you talking about
that you heard of mines?

07:38.125 --> 07:39.825
(sucking teeth)
Why you sucking
your teeth?

07:39.893 --> 07:42.160
That's a rap song.
So?

07:42.229 --> 07:44.129
I can rap.
You...

07:44.198 --> 07:46.164

with an attitude.

08:09.790 --> 08:10.889
What do you mean,
get there?

08:10.958 --> 08:12.791
It's easy.
You have a studio.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.426
You own your own studio.
Right. Right.

08:14.495 --> 08:16.228

09:19.927 --> 09:23.628
for me to becoming the woman
that I've always wanted to be.

09:23.697 --> 09:26.865
♪ So mark my words
before you swallow ♪

09:26.934 --> 09:30.535

09:33.307 --> 09:34.406
(doctor)
Knock knock.

09:34.474 --> 09:35.740
Hi!
Hi.

09:35.809 --> 09:37.275
Are you Sidney?
Yes.

09:37.344 --> 09:38.743
Sidney Starr,
the one and only.

09:38.812 --> 09:40.612
I'm Dr. Ting.
Nice to meet you.

09:40.681 --> 09:43.682
I'm happy and excited
to be here right now.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.684
Scared, nervous,
all at once.

09:45.752 --> 09:47.352
Right, that's all normal.

09:47.421 --> 09:50.622
I'm just ready to
really, really,
really become complete,

09:50.691 --> 09:52.991
and just get my (bleep).

09:53.060 --> 09:55.760
All right, I'm here
to help you get that thing

09:55.829 --> 09:57.395
and help you take
this next step.

09:57.464 --> 09:59.297
You look like someone
who's been on hormones...

09:59.366 --> 10:00.899
For a long time, yes.
So, that's a--

10:00.968 --> 10:02.567
I'm-- I'm a veteran at this.

10:02.636 --> 10:04.002
And you're preferred pronoun?

10:04.071 --> 10:05.470
She.
She?

10:05.539 --> 10:06.805
And her.
Okay.

10:06.873 --> 10:07.872
Or that bitch.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.008
Okay, we won't--
we won't use that word here.

10:10.077 --> 10:12.377
I have so many
questions, though.

10:12.446 --> 10:15.080
Like, I know I want
the penis to be gone.

10:15.148 --> 10:18.016
But if I cannot (bleep),

10:18.085 --> 10:20.619
I would rather
freaking die,

10:20.687 --> 10:23.188
because I love to (bleep).

10:23.256 --> 10:25.256
As far as sensation,
you know,

10:25.325 --> 10:28.526
the basic concept is we take
the-- the skin of the penis...

10:28.595 --> 10:30.195
Mm-hmm?
Right?

10:30.263 --> 10:32.397
And we turn that
inside-out, like a sock.

10:32.466 --> 10:34.799
Wow.
And so, the outside
of the penis

10:34.868 --> 10:37.202
becomes the inside
of the vagina.
Oh!

10:37.270 --> 10:40.171
We save the tip
of the penis, the glans,

10:40.240 --> 10:42.674
and that becomes
your-- your clitoris.

10:42.743 --> 10:44.542
Okay, great.

10:44.611 --> 10:47.045
And I wanna be able to
take a 10-incher, like...

10:47.114 --> 10:49.347
Okay, generally,
we are able to achieve

10:49.416 --> 10:51.816
six, seven inches
of depth.

10:51.885 --> 10:54.352
Okay, see...
I ain't gonna lie.

10:54.421 --> 10:56.087
I usually deal
with the big...

10:56.156 --> 10:59.958
the big men.

11:00.027 --> 11:02.060
Before we go any further,
I need to warn you

11:02.129 --> 11:03.795
about the risks
of surgery.

11:03.864 --> 11:05.497
Okay, what is it?

11:05.565 --> 11:07.632
When we're making
that pocket for the vagina,

11:07.701 --> 11:10.168
it is possible that
we can injure the rectum...

11:10.237 --> 11:12.203
Oh my God.
...accidentally...

11:12.272 --> 11:13.638
Really?
...and make a hole

11:13.707 --> 11:14.773
in one of those structures.

11:14.841 --> 11:16.641
We don't want that
to happen because...

11:16.710 --> 11:18.009
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait...

11:18.078 --> 11:19.744
Because when it does, poop,

11:19.813 --> 11:21.479
instead of coming out
through the anus,

11:21.548 --> 11:22.814
can come out
through the vagina.

11:22.883 --> 11:24.149
Are you freaking serious?

11:24.217 --> 11:26.985
It sounds like there's
a lot more to this procedure

11:27.054 --> 11:28.687
than I even knew.

11:28.755 --> 11:32.557
So... I have
one last question.

11:32.626 --> 11:35.160
How much
is this gonna cost?

11:35.228 --> 11:37.362
We're talking 30,000,
40,000.

11:37.431 --> 11:39.731
Oh, my God.

11:39.800 --> 11:44.035
Yeah, there's a lot
to think about.

11:44.104 --> 11:47.505
(Sidney)
The doctor said it's gonna
be $30,000 to $40,000.

11:47.574 --> 11:49.774
I was involved
in a shooting.

11:49.843 --> 11:52.811
I don't want to be a part
of the whole situation,
honestly.

11:52.879 --> 11:55.613
I plan on proposing to Kim.

11:55.682 --> 11:57.282
You sure that's what
you wanna do?

11:57.350 --> 11:59.517
You're not just doing this
because you're going away?

11:59.586 --> 12:02.487
It's been a long time.
Been a minute.

12:09.796 --> 12:11.196
(car horn honking)

12:11.264 --> 12:14.766
Big booty bitch
walking across the street!

12:14.835 --> 12:17.202
Dr. Ting gave me a lot
to think about

12:17.270 --> 12:19.104
when it comes
to my bottom surgery.

12:19.172 --> 12:21.806
I wanna talk to somebody
who's been under the knife

12:21.875 --> 12:24.976
and has came out
with amazing results.

12:25.045 --> 12:27.545
I brought you
some lemonade!

12:27.614 --> 12:29.581
Oh, you're so sweet!

12:29.649 --> 12:32.183
Did you put any vodka in it?
No, bitch.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.819
After the winery,
Mariah reached out to me

12:34.888 --> 12:36.054
to see if I was okay,

12:36.123 --> 12:39.991
and to explain to me
that dramatic exit.

12:40.060 --> 12:42.627
Mariah is somebody I hope
that I can get to know

12:42.696 --> 12:44.229
a little bit better.

12:44.297 --> 12:46.598
You know what, let's start
with how do you feel?

12:46.666 --> 12:50.335
That was crazy, like...
I literally had intentions

12:50.403 --> 12:53.271
on that day
being positive.

12:53.340 --> 12:56.674
I wanted to make things
right with, you know, Nya.

12:56.743 --> 12:58.476
And it just backfired.

12:58.545 --> 13:01.579
But what the heck happened
with you and Nya?

13:01.648 --> 13:03.615
It literally almost got
physical with me and Nya.

13:03.683 --> 13:06.217
Like, I don't have time
to be on a vineyard

13:06.286 --> 13:09.154
having a (bleep)
wrestling match
with people.

13:09.222 --> 13:11.089
I'm just over it,
honestly.

13:11.158 --> 13:12.757
Like, I don't even
wanna talk about
that (bleep) no more.

13:12.826 --> 13:15.660
The winery was a bad look
for everybody,

13:15.729 --> 13:17.295
and it took me back
to a place

13:17.364 --> 13:19.531
that I tried
to stay away from.

13:19.599 --> 13:21.432
But I'm determined to change,

13:21.501 --> 13:24.969
and I wanna help Sidney
do the same.

13:25.038 --> 13:27.372
So, how did
your appointment go?

13:27.440 --> 13:29.474
Girl, it was a lot.

13:29.543 --> 13:32.477
I was really afraid

13:32.546 --> 13:35.513
to admit that I
still had a penis.

13:35.582 --> 13:37.148
Trans woman who are post-op,

13:37.217 --> 13:39.484
meaning they have
the full sex change,

13:39.553 --> 13:41.686
they usually get
treated better

13:41.755 --> 13:43.521
than the girls like me
who are pre-op.

13:43.590 --> 13:46.624
You're very strong
for actually going
through with this process.

13:46.693 --> 13:48.193
Here's another problem.

13:48.261 --> 13:50.361
I don't have the money
like that for it.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.597
The doctor said
it's gonna be

13:52.666 --> 13:54.699
$30,000 to $40,000.

13:54.768 --> 13:57.468
Oh, my God, Sidney.
So, it's a lot on...

13:57.537 --> 14:00.305
That was what--
I said, hold on, now!

14:00.373 --> 14:01.439
Like, I wanna just have--

14:01.508 --> 14:02.707
Girl, we gotta establish
how we're gonna pay

14:02.776 --> 14:03.975
for this surgery.

14:04.044 --> 14:05.710
Now, do you have--

14:05.779 --> 14:07.745
Get in a strip club
and shaking that thang.

14:07.814 --> 14:09.647
Bitch, sit your ass...
(chuckling)

14:09.716 --> 14:11.783
Throw them dollars, boo.

14:11.852 --> 14:14.018
Maybe do that
five times a week

14:14.087 --> 14:17.121
out of a month,
and I'll be good.
No, no, you cannot do that.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.891
Okay, since I don't
have the money like
that right now...

14:19.960 --> 14:22.160
Right, which worries me.
...what do you suggest

14:22.229 --> 14:23.862
that I should do
at this point?

14:23.930 --> 14:27.332
You need a record.
You need a bop.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.934
You need something
that is gonna scream you.

14:30.003 --> 14:31.336
Like an attitude record,

14:31.404 --> 14:34.639
and it's just to
get a feel of,
like, who you are.

14:34.708 --> 14:36.908
Like, you gotta give it
to me, like...

14:36.977 --> 14:38.543
(rapping)
♪ I'm a boss chick
with nice lips ♪

14:38.612 --> 14:40.178
♪ Have you excited

14:40.247 --> 14:41.946
♪ Wanna get freaky

14:45.552 --> 14:47.285

with a bottle of Cris ♪

14:47.354 --> 14:49.754
Like, you gotta--
You bringing
a tear to my eye.

14:49.823 --> 14:51.356
Bitch, you gotta give it
to me and give me that...

14:51.424 --> 14:53.524
It looks good, I like...
Unh, unh.

14:53.593 --> 14:55.126
You're a professional,
you really are a professional.

14:55.195 --> 14:56.394
You know,
give me woman, like...

14:56.463 --> 14:59.130
I see you
just serving life,

14:59.199 --> 15:03.067
like, giving the people
attitude, boss, sex,

15:03.136 --> 15:06.504
titties, ass, and then...
new vagina, bitch.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.673
Yes!

15:08.742 --> 15:11.876
♪♪

15:16.082 --> 15:17.782
The trip to the vineyard
was supposed to be a day

15:17.851 --> 15:20.585
where we would all
come together and kumbaya

15:20.654 --> 15:21.953
and be great friends again,

15:22.022 --> 15:24.022
and clearly that's not
what happened.

15:24.090 --> 15:26.224
So today, I'm very excited
to hang out with two friends

15:26.293 --> 15:29.427
that are very secluded
from all this drama

15:29.496 --> 15:30.962
and outside of any mess.

15:31.031 --> 15:32.330
Put this next to you.

15:32.399 --> 15:33.698
My girl Alexis is coming,
so put it over here.

15:33.767 --> 15:35.066
All right.
Have you met Alexis?

15:35.135 --> 15:36.334
Yeah, I do know her.
Okay.

15:36.403 --> 15:37.635
We did a TV show together,

15:37.704 --> 15:39.337
and I think we have
mutual friends.

15:39.406 --> 15:40.605
Oh, cute, cute, cute.
All right.

15:40.674 --> 15:42.173
Right.
Yeah, she's on her way too.

15:42.242 --> 15:45.109
Well, bitch, thank God
you have been so busy.

15:45.178 --> 15:47.378
Why?
Because, remember
I invited you

15:47.447 --> 15:48.579
to that vineyard
and you were like,

15:48.648 --> 15:49.981
you had something going on,
I think it was--

15:50.050 --> 15:51.482
I don't remember, you weren't
feeling something--

15:51.551 --> 15:52.850
At the store.
Yeah.

15:52.919 --> 15:54.786
But, when I tell you,

15:54.854 --> 15:57.855
all hell
broke loose, Maggie.

15:57.924 --> 16:01.693
Like, it was a nonstop
(bleep)show.

16:01.761 --> 16:04.429
Nya got into it
with Sidney and Mariah.

16:04.497 --> 16:05.964
And as per usual,
Kimbella was talking

16:06.032 --> 16:07.332
all kinds of (bleep)
about Yandy.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.733
I'm so confused.

16:08.802 --> 16:10.768
No, no, I was
dead confused.

16:10.837 --> 16:12.537
'Cause she felt
comfortable enough

16:12.605 --> 16:16.307
to sit there and talk about
Yandy adopting Infinity

16:16.376 --> 16:19.310
for, I don't know,
like clout or something?

16:19.379 --> 16:21.045
No, she did not say that.

16:21.114 --> 16:22.480
I swear to God.
No, she didn't.

16:22.549 --> 16:24.816
She did.
That's gonna
strike up something.

16:24.884 --> 16:26.484
You know, she don't play
about her kids.

16:26.553 --> 16:30.154
One thing I know about Yandy,
she's all about family,

16:30.223 --> 16:31.990
and don't ever
come for her kids.

16:32.058 --> 16:35.793
And I know Yandy loves Infinity
like one of her own.

16:35.862 --> 16:38.296
I'm over it,
I'm so over it, like...

16:38.365 --> 16:40.965
You and your friends
are different, I'm telling you.

16:41.034 --> 16:42.533
(Jonathan)
Hey, pretty girl!

16:42.602 --> 16:44.202
Hey, babe.

16:44.270 --> 16:46.771
You would pick outside.
Mwah, how are you?

16:46.840 --> 16:49.007
Hi!
Hello, I'm fine.
How are you?

16:49.075 --> 16:50.341
Ever since
the shooting happened,

16:50.410 --> 16:51.743
I've been trying to strategize

16:51.811 --> 16:53.211
and think about
what I'm about to do

16:53.279 --> 16:54.879
with my music career,
so I can get out of my contract

16:54.948 --> 16:56.514
and start working
with other artists.

16:56.583 --> 16:58.616
But most important, I need
to make other money

16:58.685 --> 17:00.385
so I can start
providing for my daughter.

17:00.453 --> 17:01.719
What's going on
with you, though?

17:01.788 --> 17:04.756
Yeah, what's up, girl?
I'm sure you guys heard.

17:04.824 --> 17:06.624
I was involved
in a shooting

17:06.693 --> 17:09.293
with 6ix9ine and them,
and it was just, like,
traumatic for me.

17:09.362 --> 17:10.561
And it's just like,
anything could
have happened.

17:10.630 --> 17:11.929
A bullet doesn't have
a name to it.

17:11.998 --> 17:14.032
And I just feel like...

17:14.100 --> 17:15.466
it's just something
I had to think about.

17:15.535 --> 17:16.701
Mm-hmm.
You know what I mean?
Not only that,

17:16.770 --> 17:18.302
I wasn't getting
studio time.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.004
It was just, like,
a whole bunch of
back and forth.

17:20.073 --> 17:21.572
I just-- I don't
wanna be a part

17:21.641 --> 17:23.441
of the whole
situation, honestly.

17:23.510 --> 17:24.809
I got shot before.

17:24.878 --> 17:27.078
A fight broke out,
followed by shots.

17:27.147 --> 17:28.780
I can't even imagine it.
As if it's nonexistent.

17:28.848 --> 17:31.049
And first of all,
thank God that
you're alive.

17:31.117 --> 17:33.351
Every day.
Like, seriously.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.186
Every single...
Like, you have
angels all on you,

17:35.255 --> 17:37.655
'cause that shooting
(bleep) is not no joke.

17:37.724 --> 17:40.124
I'm at a point now where
I'm just gonna branch off

17:40.193 --> 17:42.493
and, like, network
with other people.

17:42.562 --> 17:45.296
I'm actually about to get
in the studio with Maino.

17:45.365 --> 17:46.898
He was talking
about some song.

17:46.966 --> 17:49.233
The song is called "Badder"
or "My Girl's Badder,"

17:49.302 --> 17:50.501
something like that.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.771
I'm pretty sure Alexis
just named the track

17:53.840 --> 17:56.240
that I specifically
asked Maino to get on.

17:56.309 --> 17:58.042
I've been dying to get
on this track,

17:58.111 --> 17:59.277
and Maino knows it.

17:59.345 --> 18:01.846
If you wanna come through
and catch a vibe.

18:01.915 --> 18:03.381
I'm down,
I'll be there.

18:03.450 --> 18:05.049
Just kinda wanted
to bring it
to your attention,

18:05.118 --> 18:06.617
'cause I know,
I don't want it to
be uncomfortable.

18:06.686 --> 18:08.653
Definitely.
I haven't been to his studio.

18:08.721 --> 18:11.522
He-- he doesn't even invite me
to the studio when he goes.

18:11.591 --> 18:12.790
Well, now you have
a reason to come.

18:12.859 --> 18:14.692
Now you can pull up.
Thank you, Alexis,

18:14.761 --> 18:16.727
for my invite, thank you.
Pull up! Pull up.

18:16.796 --> 18:19.363
Right.
I'm not even gonna tell him.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.866
Yeah, just pop up.
Right.

18:21.935 --> 18:23.301
So, what's next
with Sidney, bro?

18:23.369 --> 18:24.635
Like, far as in
the record.

18:24.704 --> 18:26.504
(Rich)
It's a dub.

18:26.573 --> 18:28.406
When I find the team
that's gonna help me

18:28.475 --> 18:29.841
and believe in me
more than you do,

18:29.909 --> 18:32.176
I want you to have
that same energy.

18:34.280 --> 18:37.615
♪♪

18:37.684 --> 18:39.717
(Rich)
Every since the stuff
with Miracle happened,

18:39.786 --> 18:41.886
Sidney Starr has been
on the back burner.

18:41.955 --> 18:43.654
So today, I'm meeting
with Jaquae

18:43.723 --> 18:45.623
to find out where we landed

18:45.692 --> 18:48.693
with hooking up Sidney
and Nya, and all that stuff.

18:50.330 --> 18:51.729
Trash!
(laughing)

18:51.798 --> 18:54.065
What's up, Rich?

18:54.134 --> 18:56.100
You know, waiting for
the engineer to pull up.

18:56.169 --> 18:57.835
Okay.
And also Nya, you feel me?

18:57.904 --> 18:59.370
Nya's coming through?
Of course, man!

18:59.439 --> 19:01.172
Oh, good, good, good.
Like, so what's up
with you, man?

19:01.241 --> 19:03.541
Like, what's going on?

19:03.610 --> 19:05.643
You been a little distant
lately, guy, like...

19:05.712 --> 19:08.012
Nah, I been--
I was in Mississippi.

19:08.081 --> 19:11.115
So, my daughter's mom
got into a situation

19:11.184 --> 19:13.284
with-- with her husband.

19:13.353 --> 19:15.219
She ended up
shooting the dude.

19:15.288 --> 19:17.688
What?!
Yeah, she shot him twice.

19:17.757 --> 19:19.090
Man, that's crazy, bro.

19:19.159 --> 19:20.625
Like-- like, she could
seriously, like,

19:20.693 --> 19:21.893
face some time for that.

19:21.961 --> 19:23.461
She looking
at two to 20.

19:23.530 --> 19:25.096
So, I'm like,
yo, this is crazy.

19:25.165 --> 19:26.230
I'm down here stressed out,

19:26.299 --> 19:27.732
that's why I ain't
been around, that's why--

19:27.800 --> 19:28.933
I've been wondering,
I was like,

19:29.002 --> 19:30.601
where the hell
you been you've been at?

19:30.670 --> 19:32.003
Yeah, man, it's been crazy,
bro, it's been crazy.

19:32.071 --> 19:34.872
Hello, guys!
Nya!

19:34.941 --> 19:37.208
Oh, (bleep) look at the OG.
Look at the OG!

19:37.277 --> 19:39.377
(Nya)
Jonathan's winery trip

19:39.445 --> 19:41.245
was a breaking point for me.

19:41.314 --> 19:43.915
Old Nya Lee
came roaring back.

19:43.983 --> 19:46.918
I nearly lost my mind
trying to help Sidney Starr.

19:46.986 --> 19:48.786
So, I'm here to tell
Rich Dollaz

19:48.855 --> 19:51.055
I'm retiring
from the position

19:51.124 --> 19:52.623
of being her mentor.

19:52.692 --> 19:57.094
I did a solid favor
for you trying to
raise Sidney Starr.

19:57.163 --> 19:58.496
Oh, snap.
Facts.

19:58.565 --> 20:00.131
I thought that
was going well.
What's going on?

20:00.200 --> 20:01.832
It's like he dropped off
a bad kid

20:01.901 --> 20:03.267
and never came back
and checked up on it.

20:03.336 --> 20:04.802
(laughter)

20:04.871 --> 20:07.038
She's horrible,
I can't do it no more.

20:07.106 --> 20:08.139
For real?
I gotta take off
my jacket.

20:08.208 --> 20:09.574
Catch me up, catch me up,
catch me up.

20:09.642 --> 20:11.008
(overlapping chatter)

20:11.077 --> 20:12.343
Hold up, there's multiple
bad Sidney Starr stories?

20:12.412 --> 20:14.145
I'm gonna just let you
go on and speak.

20:14.214 --> 20:15.780
I went through
all of my closet,

20:15.848 --> 20:16.981
I had a whole bunch
of clothes.

20:17.050 --> 20:18.849
I booked a studio
session, everything,

20:18.918 --> 20:20.384
had the clothes
laid out on a rack.

20:20.453 --> 20:22.653
That's when my man
Jaquae came in.

20:22.722 --> 20:25.089
She gave me hell about
donating clothes to her.

20:25.158 --> 20:26.657
What is this,
her insecurities?

20:26.726 --> 20:28.526
Like, what is it that--
what's she worried
about clothes for?

20:28.595 --> 20:30.061
I don't know.
She took one of my dresses,

20:30.129 --> 20:31.295
threw it on the floor.

20:31.364 --> 20:34.031
Said, "I'm not with this!"
(pool cue clatters)

20:34.100 --> 20:35.800
And then, we got
in an argument

20:35.868 --> 20:37.702
at Jonathan's
makeup event.
For what?

20:37.770 --> 20:40.104
Shorty had the nerve
to go like...

20:40.173 --> 20:41.906
Yo!
Sidney did that?!

20:41.975 --> 20:45.443
At me!
I don't know what
the (bleep) is going on!

20:45.511 --> 20:47.411
Then Jonathan
puts together this event

20:47.480 --> 20:48.746
for all the girls
to get away.

20:48.815 --> 20:50.748
Sidney kept trying
to apologize to me,

20:50.817 --> 20:52.583
and I'm like, yo, girl,
just give me space.

20:52.652 --> 20:55.686
She's still trying to hug me,
trying to-- to apologize.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.521
I'm like, girl,
leave me alone.

20:57.590 --> 20:58.656
Y'all (bleep)
got me sweating.

20:58.725 --> 21:01.058
At this point, I'm good.

21:01.127 --> 21:03.361
I wanna wash my hands
with Sidney Starr.

21:03.429 --> 21:04.695
Yo, this is crazy.

21:04.764 --> 21:07.365
But!
A deal's a deal.

21:07.433 --> 21:10.668
And... we gonna work
on you now.

21:10.737 --> 21:13.337
Yes! Ooh!
All right.

21:13.406 --> 21:15.106
So the headaches was worth it.
That's the first thing.
It was worth it.

21:15.174 --> 21:16.941
(Rich)
Nya's biggest problem
has always been

21:17.010 --> 21:18.643
getting her music
in the right room

21:18.711 --> 21:19.777
with the right people.

21:19.846 --> 21:21.279
So, you know what?

21:21.347 --> 21:23.014
I'm gonna make
a few phone calls.

21:23.082 --> 21:24.415
But I need to sit down
with Sidney

21:24.484 --> 21:25.683
and figure out
what's going on.

21:25.752 --> 21:27.585
I tried to get Jaquae
to help Sidney,

21:27.654 --> 21:29.620
I tried to get
Nya to help Sidney.

21:29.689 --> 21:32.223
It seems as though Sidney
don't even wanna help herself.

21:32.292 --> 21:33.924
So, what's next
with Sidney, bro?

21:33.993 --> 21:35.726
Like, far as in the record,
like, what are we gonna do?

21:35.795 --> 21:37.361
Like, you wanna proceed?

21:37.430 --> 21:39.764
I gotta reconsider
working with Sidney at all,

21:39.832 --> 21:41.799
because it doesn't seem
like she's learning

21:41.868 --> 21:44.268
and taking
this process seriously.

21:44.337 --> 21:46.937
It's a dub, and that's all
I'm gonna say on it.

21:51.711 --> 21:53.044
(Maino)
How the hell you've been?

21:53.112 --> 21:55.212
Good, it's been a long time.
Been a minute.

21:55.281 --> 21:57.882
You knew me back
in the stripper days.
Yeah.

21:57.950 --> 21:59.183
Now, you're an artist.
Yes.

21:59.252 --> 22:01.619
I met Alexis Skyy years ago
when she was a dancer.

22:01.688 --> 22:03.487
Now, she's doing her thing,
she's rapping.

22:03.556 --> 22:05.523
And she has a little buzz
for her personality,

22:05.591 --> 22:06.924
and I thought
I would give her a try.

22:06.993 --> 22:09.493
I'm getting the runaround
right now with this label.

22:09.562 --> 22:10.861
So, how is that
going for you?

22:10.930 --> 22:12.063
A (bleep) mess.

22:12.131 --> 22:13.397
Everything
that was told to me,

22:13.466 --> 22:15.166
I'm not--
it's not happening.

22:15.234 --> 22:17.201
The legal rumors
about Shottie and 6ix9ine,

22:17.270 --> 22:18.703
they're all over the news,

22:18.771 --> 22:20.838
all over the blogs,
and all over the media.

22:20.907 --> 22:23.274
Then we got shot at
during a label lunch.

22:23.343 --> 22:25.776
And even now, the empty
promises about my career

22:25.845 --> 22:27.044
are still continuing,

22:27.113 --> 22:28.546
and I'm completely
over this (bleep).

22:28.614 --> 22:30.748
I hope linking up
with an artist like Maino

22:30.817 --> 22:33.017
can help pave my way
into this music industry.

22:33.086 --> 22:34.952
And the fact that you
taking your music serious,

22:35.021 --> 22:36.320
I respect that.

22:36.389 --> 22:38.089
So, this might be something
that you can (bleep) with.

22:38.157 --> 22:40.358
Okay.

What's up?
How you feeling?

Hey, sexy.
Hi, girl.

23:09.622 --> 23:11.522
How are you?
Good.

23:11.591 --> 23:12.923
Y'all met already,
y'all met before.

23:12.992 --> 23:14.692
Yes, we met.
Yeah.

23:14.761 --> 23:16.460
What's up with you, baby?

23:16.529 --> 23:18.629
I ain't know
you was pulling up.

23:18.698 --> 23:20.297
What's wrong?

23:20.366 --> 23:23.067
(Maggie)
Maino thinks it's okay
to dismiss me and my dreams

23:23.136 --> 23:26.003
and then give a track
about his chick to Alexis

23:26.072 --> 23:27.872
instead of giving me a chance?

23:27.940 --> 23:31.642
No shade-- Alexis Skyy told me
she just started rapping.

23:31.711 --> 23:33.544
So, how is she more qualified
than I am?

23:33.613 --> 23:36.914
I asked you to
get on this song.

23:36.983 --> 23:38.516
When I invited Maggie
to the studio,

23:38.584 --> 23:40.284
I had absolutely no idea

23:40.353 --> 23:42.453
that Maino was gonna give her
the same track

23:42.522 --> 23:44.455
that he was trying
to get me to get on.

23:44.524 --> 23:46.290
Honestly, that's some
messy (bleep),

23:46.359 --> 23:48.726
I'm not even gonna lie,
'cause it looks crazy on my end.

23:48.795 --> 23:50.628
Right, right, right.

23:50.696 --> 23:51.996
I'ma let y'all
talk this out.

23:52.064 --> 23:55.433
Tssh.

23:55.501 --> 23:57.835
Listen to what I'm saying.

23:57.904 --> 24:01.572
I've never heard you
take music serious.

24:01.641 --> 24:04.375
Jermaine, it's not like
I just one day

24:04.444 --> 24:07.144
got with a rapper
and decided to do music.

24:07.213 --> 24:08.846
You already knew
that's where my heart was

24:08.915 --> 24:11.081
because I came and met you
in your studio

24:11.150 --> 24:12.650
to use your studio.

24:12.718 --> 24:14.518
Right, but what
I'm saying to you is this.

24:14.587 --> 24:18.923
Since then, have you been
making strides

24:18.991 --> 24:21.826
to actively...
No, since then...

24:21.894 --> 24:23.093
...involve yourself
with music?

24:23.162 --> 24:25.729
No!
You never made me
feel like music

24:25.798 --> 24:28.432
is really your passion
and is really your dream.

24:28.501 --> 24:29.567
What you want me to do?

24:29.635 --> 24:32.837
You never made me
feel like that.

24:32.905 --> 24:34.338
You don't want me
to be a singer.

24:34.407 --> 24:37.174
You want me to be a...
a businesswoman.

24:37.243 --> 24:38.709
You want me
to run Hair Like...

24:38.778 --> 24:40.144
What's-- what's wrong
with that, though?

24:40.213 --> 24:41.745
You want me to run
Hair Like Maggie--

24:41.814 --> 24:43.113
What's wrong with having
a real foundation though?

24:43.182 --> 24:44.982
Because that's what you want.
That's not what I want,

24:45.051 --> 24:47.051
so now I'm not using
my creative side.

24:47.119 --> 24:48.853
Like people running 'round
chasing after this
music (bleep)

24:48.921 --> 24:50.588
and don't never get to
where they need to get to.

24:50.656 --> 24:52.656
So now, you're putting
a dim on my--

24:52.725 --> 24:54.625
I feel like then
it's your fault.

24:54.694 --> 24:56.327
Listen, I spent a decade

24:56.395 --> 24:58.195
in this music business,
and I'm still, to this day,

24:58.264 --> 24:59.530
not all the way
where I want to be.

24:59.599 --> 25:01.432
And I just want her
to know that

25:01.501 --> 25:03.334
if this is something
that she wants to do,

25:03.402 --> 25:05.970
then we up for
a uphill ride.

25:06.038 --> 25:08.873
So, yes, I did push Maggie
to open up a store,

25:08.941 --> 25:12.977
pursue other things,
to actually have a foundation,

25:13.045 --> 25:16.113
to actually have, you know,
guaranteed income coming in.

25:16.182 --> 25:18.682
A lot of dudes out here
taking away from their women.

25:18.751 --> 25:20.184
I'm adding on.

25:20.253 --> 25:21.485
I didn't stop you
from doing it.

What, you brought
reinforcements?

25:47.547 --> 25:50.648
With you going away, we all
need to be a united front.

25:50.716 --> 25:53.117

So, when you going
on the road again?

26:09.402 --> 26:12.102
Um, we got a few shows
this weekend.

26:12.171 --> 26:15.573
And we got a big, big show
coming up in the Apollo.

26:15.641 --> 26:18.142
Yeah, I know about that.

26:18.210 --> 26:19.877
That should be real dope,

26:19.946 --> 26:21.879
right around the time
the album's coming out.

26:21.948 --> 26:23.981
Being on house arrest
has made it hard for me

26:24.050 --> 26:27.084
to move and get to the studio
as much as possible.

26:27.153 --> 26:29.353
So, I'm real happy
that the judge

26:29.422 --> 26:32.022
granted me some leeway
so I can focus on this music.

26:32.091 --> 26:33.424
It's how I feed my family.

26:33.492 --> 26:34.725
So, I've been talking
to the fellas.

26:34.794 --> 26:37.895
Me and the guys, you know,
Cam, Jim, Freekey,

26:37.964 --> 26:40.464
and we got this one
really, really big show

26:40.533 --> 26:43.601
coming up real soon
at the world-famous Apollo

26:43.669 --> 26:45.135
right in the heart of Harlem.

26:45.204 --> 26:48.772
And I got the biggest surprise
for a very special person.

26:48.841 --> 26:50.207
So, what about a single?

26:50.276 --> 26:52.242
We got songs that
we really like.
Thank you.

26:52.311 --> 26:54.878
But we're just gonna see
what the people gravitate to.

26:54.947 --> 26:57.481
Mm-hmm.

26:57.550 --> 26:59.984
So, another thing
I've been--

27:00.052 --> 27:01.185
been thinking about.

27:01.253 --> 27:05.990
I plan on...
proposing to Kim.

27:06.058 --> 27:08.392
You sure that's what
you wanna do?

27:08.461 --> 27:11.061
Or, you're not just doing this
because you're going away?

27:11.130 --> 27:14.198
No, I mean, that's the person
I wanna spend my life with

27:14.266 --> 27:15.833
at the end
of the day, so...

27:15.901 --> 27:17.401
You gonna feel comfortable
getting married,

27:17.470 --> 27:22.006
and your brother
and Kim don't get along?

27:24.110 --> 27:26.910
Jermaine is my older brother,
but we call him Twin

27:26.979 --> 27:29.046
'cause we actually look
so much alike.

27:29.115 --> 27:32.116
We've always been
super tight, super close.

27:32.184 --> 27:33.917
So, there was a time
when me and Kim

27:33.986 --> 27:35.519
weren't on the best terms,

27:35.588 --> 27:39.056
and I think Kim feels like
that my brother chose my side

27:39.125 --> 27:40.891
instead of being neutral
in the whole situation.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.626
I love my mother to death,

27:42.695 --> 27:44.928
but sometimes I think
she just worries too much

27:44.997 --> 27:48.365
and focuses on stuff
that's in the past.

27:48.434 --> 27:52.069
I feel like time
heals all wounds.

27:52.138 --> 27:55.205
And I understand it's
a tough situation, but...

27:55.274 --> 27:58.709
The family's always been
really close, close.

27:58.778 --> 28:01.145
Like, I always tell
people you and Jermaine

28:01.213 --> 28:03.814
are like connected
at the hip, okay?

28:03.883 --> 28:06.917
I don't want nothing
to take that

28:06.986 --> 28:09.319
from neither one of y'all,

28:09.388 --> 28:11.488
be it Kim or anybody.

28:11.557 --> 28:13.190
That bothers me a lot.

28:13.259 --> 28:14.992
I hate seeing my mother cry.

28:15.061 --> 28:17.428
I'm her baby boy,
and at the end of the day,

28:17.496 --> 28:20.964
seeing the family divided
is not something that I want.

28:21.033 --> 28:23.867
There's a lot of big changes
in our future,

28:23.936 --> 28:25.235

Last night, Hollywood Play
was gunned down

35:00.399 --> 35:03.300
outside of a club
in New York City

35:03.368 --> 35:05.368
less than 12 hours

35:05.437 --> 35:06.903
after we finished recording

what would be his last song.

35:09.374 --> 35:11.708

Hollywood Play, he was

35:36.668 --> 35:39.102
more than just an artist.

35:39.171 --> 35:41.171
He was... a dope human.

35:41.240 --> 35:44.274
He was the last person
I would ever think

35:44.343 --> 35:46.743
would get gunned down.

35:46.812 --> 35:49.246
It's so crazy.
I knew him for...

35:49.314 --> 35:51.581
I wanna say
well over ten years.

35:51.650 --> 35:54.184
And, like, he'll
send me some stuff,

35:54.253 --> 35:56.119
but we never set a day
to go to the studio

35:56.188 --> 35:57.787
until he sent me
this one joint.

35:57.856 --> 36:00.957
And I'm like, okay,
I'm recording
this tonight.

36:01.026 --> 36:04.060
And then 12 hours later,
I get a DM that

36:04.129 --> 36:06.763
he's in Jamaica Hospital,
he died.

36:06.832 --> 36:08.465
It still hasn't
registered to me.

36:08.534 --> 36:10.200
Like it's still,
"Not this guy."

36:10.269 --> 36:11.835

Not Play.

of gun violence.

36:19.244 --> 36:21.344
These bullets have no name.

36:21.413 --> 36:22.779
It's hitting
the wrong people.

36:22.848 --> 36:25.048
I miss life
before I got shot,

36:25.117 --> 36:28.285
but when so much damage
has been done to you,

36:28.353 --> 36:29.953
you become numb
and you start looking

36:30.022 --> 36:31.254
for the next thing
to happen.

happen next.
