00:18.645 --> 00:21.524
Congratulations
to Mr. Popolski and Mr. Ates,

00:22.065 --> 00:24.363
for successfully completing
junior high school.

00:24.692 --> 00:27.571
Mr. Miller, your oral exam was,
to put it mildly, a farce.

00:28.571 --> 00:30.824
I heard
you're being released this week?

00:31.574 --> 00:32.700
Very good.

00:33.034 --> 00:34.160
Although in my opinion,

00:34.494 --> 00:38.124
your lack of general education
represents a danger to the public.

00:42.710 --> 00:45.634
Just out of curiosity,
why sign up for the class at all?

00:45.964 --> 00:47.887
Because this is
the only place in prison

00:48.341 --> 00:50.309
where there's free hot chocolate.

00:52.845 --> 00:53.846
Thank you.

01:01.563 --> 01:04.441
See you in 2 weeks, bro.
- Awesome! Don't drop the soap!

01:04.774 --> 01:08.574
Shut up. Fuck a whore for me.
And you, keep your nose clean.

01:52.488 --> 01:54.582
Heeeyaa, Baby!

01:54.907 --> 01:57.285
Freeedom!

01:59.704 --> 02:01.126
What did you do to my car?

02:02.206 --> 02:03.378
Sweet, isn't it?

02:04.000 --> 02:06.970
No welcome kiss?
- Dunno. What's it going to cost me?

02:09.422 --> 02:12.096
Hey! Save the sucking
for your customers.

02:12.550 --> 02:13.767
Where's the money?

02:14.093 --> 02:15.140
I buried it.

02:17.221 --> 02:18.268
Where?

02:23.936 --> 02:26.655
OK. These are the coordinates.
I pinned it for you.

02:27.565 --> 02:29.738
I figured a schoolyard,
nobody'd look, y'know?

02:30.526 --> 02:33.279
What? - I don't have great memories
of my school days.

02:35.031 --> 02:36.374
You? Went to school?

02:37.075 --> 02:38.292
For how long?

02:38.618 --> 02:41.497
Eighth or ninth grade, not sure.
I was in my crack phase.

02:41.996 --> 02:44.670
Hey, Zeki. When you get the money,
can I get new boobs?

02:45.166 --> 02:47.635
Shut up
and honk if somebody comes.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.803
How about one? The left one?

02:50.588 --> 02:52.261
It's smaller somehow. Seriously.

02:53.549 --> 02:55.551
Can I turn on the radio?
- No.

03:08.940 --> 03:10.032
Ooooh, shoe clips.

03:10.608 --> 03:13.111
Mandy, it's not my phone,
gotta be quick.

03:13.653 --> 03:16.202
Listen, can you do
my 54 dance today?

03:18.866 --> 03:19.913
Fuck.

03:20.952 --> 03:22.579
3 METERS TO DESTINATION.

03:23.579 --> 03:25.081
What the...?

03:28.501 --> 03:29.753
I'm not into it anyway.

03:30.086 --> 03:32.009
Glitter up the
butt crack for days.

03:39.762 --> 03:41.264
Stop honking, dingbat, it's ME.

03:43.808 --> 03:45.151
It wasn't there before.

03:45.601 --> 03:48.070
There was a construction site here.
- Oh, really!?

03:48.813 --> 03:51.157
Why'd you bury
my fucking money under a site?

03:51.482 --> 03:53.405
I figured they were laying pipe.

03:55.111 --> 03:56.328
Are you mad at me?

03:56.654 --> 03:58.031
No! Why would I be?

03:58.489 --> 04:01.117
I only waited 13 months
for this fucking moment!!

04:03.119 --> 04:05.167
Maybe it could be raised up
with a ...

04:06.539 --> 04:07.540
... a crane?

04:09.041 --> 04:11.965
You owe me 2,000 euros.
And 50 for the glass table.

04:12.295 --> 04:13.672
Gimme a break, Attila.

04:15.423 --> 04:18.302
In a week or two
I'll have the money from my job.

04:19.552 --> 04:22.146
Just a taste, if it takes longer.

04:23.389 --> 04:24.811
Right. Understood.

04:25.975 --> 04:28.854
Can I crash here?
- 'Til Gina's back from the fat farm.

04:29.187 --> 04:30.860
Then I need the display window back.

04:31.606 --> 04:33.734
Everything OK?
- Why aren't you dressed yet?

04:34.066 --> 04:35.283
The sexy teacher's next!

04:35.610 --> 04:38.614
Get going
and don't forget the glasses.

04:55.505 --> 04:58.008
Hi there. Does somebody here
need tutoring?

04:58.674 --> 05:02.224
I'll find a cellar
and dig my way to the money.

05:02.553 --> 05:04.305
Is it possible that's a shit plan?

05:04.639 --> 05:05.811
It's been a while,

05:06.140 --> 05:10.486
but I remember schools are picky about
letting thugs dig tunnels in the cellar.

05:12.396 --> 05:13.648
I'm applying for janitor.

05:13.981 --> 05:17.201
Do you know how to do repairs
and fix soda machines ?

05:17.527 --> 05:19.200
You're the dumbest teacher ever!

05:20.571 --> 05:21.697
But also the hottest.

05:22.198 --> 05:24.826
Burak, bro, sup?
- You?

05:27.370 --> 05:28.747
Man. Danger!

05:43.010 --> 05:45.229
Hey, you can't run down the bikes.

05:45.555 --> 05:48.650
Shut up and
pop a few of your moon craters.

05:57.859 --> 05:59.987
Hello.
Excuse me, can I help you?

06:01.445 --> 06:03.698
The principal's office?
- About the job?

06:04.740 --> 06:06.868
Exactly.
- To the right here, then straight.

06:07.243 --> 06:09.587
'Scuse me, could you help
with my glasses ...?

06:12.164 --> 06:15.589
Ouch. 'Scuse me, I'm fine.
'Kay, have to go.

06:15.960 --> 06:17.633
Bye. Good luck.

06:17.962 --> 06:19.134
KICK ME.

06:25.511 --> 06:27.479
One moment,
Ms. Gerster, about 10b

06:27.805 --> 06:29.648
Not now,
Ms. Leimbach-Knorr, not now.

06:30.016 --> 06:33.065
The little bastards ... - Ingrid,
please! I have job interviews.

06:33.436 --> 06:35.109
I'm fed up, my dear Gudrun.

06:36.522 --> 06:37.944
Nothing I can do about it.

06:47.867 --> 06:51.542
You look like you couldn't change
a light bulb. Done this job before?

06:56.626 --> 07:00.096
What are you, an elite janitor,
who doesn't talk to mortals?

07:00.463 --> 07:03.683
Hey! - What? - Give me back
my 2 euros. I need to top up.

07:04.008 --> 07:05.134
Fuck off, girl.

07:05.468 --> 07:08.722
Fuck your mother. - You retarded?
Fuck your own mother! - How?

07:09.055 --> 07:13.026
AMOK ALARM. Please find a room
and lock yourself in.

07:13.351 --> 07:15.319
Wild. A constant amok alarm.

07:16.020 --> 07:18.864
I swear I heard a shot.
Go, go, go, hurry up.

07:19.190 --> 07:20.362
This is the amok alarm.

07:21.025 --> 07:24.495
Please find a room
and lock yourself in.

07:25.905 --> 07:27.907
Caro, are you locking it
from the inside?

07:28.324 --> 07:31.203
What's going on now?
- The little nutcase set off the alarm.

07:32.203 --> 07:34.376
I swear it was him.
- That's a reprimand.

07:35.164 --> 07:36.962
I'm calling your parents.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.252
Oh, Ms. Gerster.
- Oh, Ms. Gerster.

07:40.169 --> 07:42.422
Oh, god no. We've made
a great impression, eh?

07:42.755 --> 07:43.847
They're just children.

07:44.256 --> 07:46.133
Good, then ... you're next and ...

07:47.468 --> 07:50.392
... the only one. Come in, then.
- Asshole.

07:52.556 --> 07:55.856
If you fuck me up again, I'll ram
your fist so far up your ass

07:56.185 --> 07:59.109
that you can scratch your throat
from inside, fucking snitch.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.526
Close the door.
- Bro!

08:05.987 --> 08:07.489
Your high school subjects?

08:09.740 --> 08:11.583
What subjects?
My favorites?

08:11.909 --> 08:13.035
I assume.

08:14.578 --> 08:17.457
Sports ...
- German?

08:18.791 --> 08:20.759
Yeah, that too.
- Good.

08:21.627 --> 08:23.300
Finally somebody without math.

08:26.590 --> 08:29.309
Does everybody have to teach?
Not enough teachers?

08:29.677 --> 08:32.556
Otherwise I wouldn't advertise
for a substitute teacher.

08:32.888 --> 08:34.640
Substitute teacher? I'm ...

08:34.974 --> 08:36.976
Right. Temp jobs, never the best.

08:37.308 --> 08:41.063
I can't promise more than 2 months,
until the end of the year, Mr. ...

08:41.397 --> 08:42.614
Miller. Zeki Miller.

08:43.566 --> 08:46.945
Janitor had a heart attack raking
leaves. We don't have a go yet ...

08:47.361 --> 08:52.242
for a new one. My whole budget goes on
police complaints and removing graffiti.

08:52.575 --> 08:55.124
Then there's the "cable fire"
in the old gym.

08:55.453 --> 08:57.581
Insurance nightmare.
Civil servant hell.

08:57.913 --> 09:00.792
So until then, we have to ...
pitch in ourselves.

09:03.335 --> 09:04.552
Do you like the new gym?

09:04.879 --> 09:07.382
I did the sketches. The architect
was a total waste.

09:07.715 --> 09:09.888
As a teacher,
I get a skeleton key, right?

09:10.217 --> 09:11.935
You ask odd questions, Mr. ...

09:12.595 --> 09:13.892
Salary?

09:15.222 --> 09:18.021
A salary is good. - You're not
a civil servant, I assume?

09:18.642 --> 09:19.894
No, not really.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.104
I can offer you 2,000 euros gross.

09:23.105 --> 09:25.278
OK, then, 2200.
But I can't go any higher.

09:25.608 --> 09:27.576
We're not Milton Academy here.

09:28.486 --> 09:30.739
Deal.
- Bring your paperwork in later

09:31.072 --> 09:33.666
and we'll see you assapissimo
in the teacher's lounge.

09:35.367 --> 09:38.621
Why didn't you call?
- We were too drunk.

09:39.038 --> 09:42.508
Slut. - Really. Did you know
she wears a push-up bra?

09:43.000 --> 09:44.126
I'm off.

09:45.002 --> 09:47.926
Danger, give me the lighter.
- Be polite, toe jam.

09:48.255 --> 09:49.347
Give it to me.

09:49.673 --> 09:52.267
There's your sister.
- Stop or she'll come over. Shit.

09:52.760 --> 09:55.764
Laura, please wear a jacket
when you sit outside.

09:56.263 --> 10:00.063
Laura, I'm talking to you.
- Laura, she's talking to you!

10:06.857 --> 10:08.234
Let it go.

10:15.533 --> 10:17.535
Could you please put out
your cigarettes?

10:19.120 --> 10:21.794
You with the blue cap.
I'm talking to you. - Elisabeth?

10:22.248 --> 10:23.465
Let it go.

10:23.791 --> 10:26.385
It takes them a bit
to learn respect for new teachers.

10:26.710 --> 10:29.008
They're not putting them.
- Nothing you can do.

10:29.338 --> 10:30.635
They learn it at home.

10:31.841 --> 10:34.720
I don't think
that's a good attitude to have.

10:36.887 --> 10:39.686
You there,
who's your home room teacher?

10:40.474 --> 10:43.648
I forget. - You deaf?
She said put out your cigarette.

10:45.146 --> 10:46.648
I don't have to listen to you.

10:54.864 --> 10:57.617
Who are you exactly?
- Miller. I start work here tomorrow.

10:57.950 --> 10:59.748
Substitute teacher.
- Oh.

11:00.369 --> 11:02.542
We work here, too.
- My condolences.

11:02.872 --> 11:06.126
About the syllables ...
could we meet up, exchange ideas?

11:06.542 --> 11:10.297
Excuse me? About what? - About
the syllables. - The syllabus?

11:10.629 --> 11:11.926
That's what I said.

11:12.715 --> 11:14.888
Right. Yeah, sure.

11:15.301 --> 11:16.928
Don't push, please!
- Today?

11:17.261 --> 11:18.683
Parent conference today!

11:19.013 --> 11:21.186
- But maybe tomorrow ...
Today's great for me.

11:22.391 --> 11:23.563
Cool.

11:32.026 --> 11:34.495
Would you like sugar?
- Got a beer?

11:36.655 --> 11:38.874
I'll look.
I don't really drink beer, but ...

11:39.617 --> 11:41.369
Something alcoholic would be great.

11:42.077 --> 11:43.124
OK.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.707
Bra.

11:58.177 --> 12:01.477
All I have is prosecco.
- That's fine. Come on.

12:01.805 --> 12:03.773
Lisi has a visitor. Yay.

12:05.684 --> 12:07.106
More, more.

12:10.814 --> 12:12.236
Anyway,

12:15.319 --> 12:18.493
I wanted a Catholic boarding school.
But then my grandma died

12:18.822 --> 12:21.541
and my sister and I are
well, orphans.

12:27.122 --> 12:30.092
Child services didn't want Laura
torn from a familiar setting.

12:30.417 --> 12:33.421
So I thought
I'd teach at my old school,

12:33.796 --> 12:36.265
which has "slightly" changed.

12:39.260 --> 12:40.807
Which college did you ...

12:42.763 --> 12:44.060
Bro! Finally.

13:02.658 --> 13:03.659
TEACHING CERTIFICATE

13:05.995 --> 13:06.996
PRINT FAIL

13:15.462 --> 13:17.635
Shit,
parents conferences are the worst.

13:17.965 --> 13:20.935
I mean,
they are all fucked-up asocials.

13:24.888 --> 13:26.310
Are you there?

13:31.812 --> 13:32.813
Man, oh man.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.458
She picked up somebody.

13:45.242 --> 13:46.539
I have to pee.

13:49.538 --> 13:52.291
Right, but a learning disability
doesn't just happen.

13:52.875 --> 13:56.755
Is it possible you're an asocial bum
who's shit at raising a child?

13:57.171 --> 13:59.720
Man, I gain weight,
but my boobs don't!

14:02.051 --> 14:03.303
She drank a little.

14:03.677 --> 14:05.930
Check in an hour
if she's still breathing, OK?

14:08.474 --> 14:10.067
Oh, my god.

14:58.482 --> 15:02.157
Morning, Ms. Mayer. - Hi, Ms. Mayer.
- Good morning. Don't yell, please!

15:02.903 --> 15:04.155
At least they greet you.

15:06.073 --> 15:07.620
Your one night stand.

15:07.950 --> 15:09.497
Shit, I don't remember anything.

15:12.413 --> 15:15.587
Caro, how does my hair look?
- As goofy as last night,

15:15.916 --> 15:17.884
so what's your problem?
- He was drunk.

15:20.295 --> 15:22.013
Hey-
- Hey-

15:22.756 --> 15:23.928
Fuck.

15:26.718 --> 15:28.220
Really hot night, huh?

15:32.558 --> 15:33.810
Elisabeth.

15:34.184 --> 15:36.812
Don't chase him
like an underfucked old maid, please.

15:39.022 --> 15:40.899
So. Play it cool, right?

15:41.275 --> 15:44.404
Calm down. - I hate playing it cool.
I want a steady boyfriend.

15:44.736 --> 15:46.659
So tell him exactly that.
That'll work.

15:48.031 --> 15:49.248
TEACHERS LOUNGE

15:50.075 --> 15:51.372
Sci-five!
- Sci-five!

15:53.287 --> 15:54.960
What are you doing?

16:00.586 --> 16:03.635
Stay back! Not one more step!
You can't stop me!

16:04.965 --> 16:07.935
People, consider your
environmental footprint on this earth.

16:08.260 --> 16:10.137
You can't just drop stuff and wait

16:10.471 --> 16:12.974
for some idiot to pick it up.
- Oh, god.

16:13.891 --> 16:16.735
Ms. Leimbach-Knorr?

16:17.686 --> 16:20.360
Is she OK?
- It's only the second floor.

16:21.398 --> 16:25.198
Please, do it. Please. Do it.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.531
We need an ambulance!
- Quick!

16:31.825 --> 16:33.247
Go to your classrooms, please!

16:36.663 --> 16:38.540
Stop filming this with your mobiles.

16:39.500 --> 16:41.844
Jeremie Pascal. Get back. Back.

16:42.252 --> 16:43.378
Go to your classrooms.

16:43.754 --> 16:45.222
Move the fuck back

16:45.547 --> 16:48.892
or I'll kick your hairless asses
and knock your metal teeth in.

16:49.218 --> 16:52.267
He needs to piss off.
- I hate that guy.

16:58.143 --> 16:59.565
Am I dead? - No, no ...

17:00.145 --> 17:01.692
Thank god. - Shit.

17:03.899 --> 17:06.448
Lisi, get out while you still can.

17:07.277 --> 17:11.281
Anybody who becomes a teacher
these days must be nuts.

17:13.825 --> 17:15.998
They're all monsters. All of them!

17:23.167 --> 17:26.468
Oh, dear. Ms. Leimbach-Knorr.
Not again.

17:27.964 --> 17:30.514
I'll call you, OK, Ingrid?
- Yes.

17:30.842 --> 17:33.891
Psychiatric clinic, I assume, right?
- Yes.

17:34.263 --> 17:35.515
Stay strong.

17:37.766 --> 17:41.236
Welcome to our new firefighter,
Mr. Miller.

17:41.645 --> 17:42.692
Good morning.

17:43.021 --> 17:44.989
So, not a great day for our school.

17:45.440 --> 17:48.159
Will it set us back? No!
Briefly:

17:48.569 --> 17:51.118
our colleague,
Ms. Leimbach-Knorr is doing poorly,

17:51.446 --> 17:54.791
but her chances
of recovery are good.

17:55.784 --> 17:58.458
She won't be teaching
for the rest of the semester.

17:58.829 --> 18:00.456
... if she ever did.

18:01.957 --> 18:06.303
Our next goal is to compensate
for the loss of our colleague.

18:06.628 --> 18:08.346
Who wants to take 10b?

18:09.673 --> 18:11.721
Mr. Gundlach, how nice.
- No, no.

18:12.050 --> 18:14.803
I wanted to ask about the play.
- Yes. No.

18:15.137 --> 18:18.858
I can't. I substituted there once,
and I simply can't.

18:19.182 --> 18:20.604
I did 2 weeks too.

18:20.934 --> 18:22.982
All I'll say is:
second-degree burns.

18:23.353 --> 18:26.653
There's nobody in 10b
who hasn't repeated at least once.

18:26.982 --> 18:30.703
Not one of them will graduate,
they're impossible. - Excuse me,

18:31.028 --> 18:33.247
the students need lessons.
I think that's ...

18:33.572 --> 18:35.540
Leimbach-Knorr only lasted 4 months.

18:35.866 --> 18:38.164
And she's ex navy!
- Ms. Schnabelstedt is right.

18:39.328 --> 18:40.375
For a change.

18:40.704 --> 18:44.675
It's shocking how little
teaching spirit is in the air here.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.173
Thank you.
- Welcome, the class is yours.

18:49.963 --> 18:52.933
... er, what does that mean?
- Lessons, Ms. Schnabelstedt.

18:54.259 --> 18:55.602
This is principal Gerster.

18:55.927 --> 18:59.022
Students, return to your class
immediately. Lessons will resume!

18:59.348 --> 19:02.397
Hello, Mr. Miller.
Excuse me, do you have a minute?

19:04.019 --> 19:07.398
What is it? - Chantal, your mother
needs to pick up the knife.

19:07.731 --> 19:10.280
Listen, about yesterday ...

19:10.609 --> 19:12.486
I thought I had a class now.
- Briefly.

19:12.861 --> 19:15.740
I was totally drunk.
In case you were thinking ...

19:16.823 --> 19:20.327
I'm not into that.
It doesn't mean anything to me, right?

19:21.370 --> 19:23.793
What's that?
- It'd be great if neither of us ...

19:26.208 --> 19:27.551
misinterpreted it.

19:27.918 --> 19:30.091
Gonna be hard, but I'll try.
OK. Forgotten.

19:30.837 --> 19:31.838
Really?

19:32.255 --> 19:34.428
Yeah, great.
Good. I mean ...

19:34.758 --> 19:37.853
We're colleagues and we shouldn't ...
jump the gun, mix up ...

19:38.720 --> 19:42.065
Super. So ... let's go.
Pretty chaotic school, eh?

19:47.938 --> 19:49.235
Forgotten.

19:53.527 --> 19:54.779
Oh, my god.

19:59.950 --> 20:01.076
'Scuse me.

20:15.173 --> 20:18.518
Good Morni...
- Yeah, yeah. Stop that shit.

20:24.599 --> 20:27.648
Hey you, Peter Parker,
go get a TV from the equipment room.

20:28.270 --> 20:31.649
My name is Mr. Miller. If you don't want
trouble, keep your trap shut.

20:32.774 --> 20:34.071
I'm only here temporarily.

20:34.943 --> 20:38.117
You've all got an A. Bust my balls
and I'll mark you down a grade.

20:38.488 --> 20:40.707
Got it?
- Yes.

20:43.410 --> 20:46.004
Hey, fatso, you listening?
Give me the notebook.

20:49.249 --> 20:51.877
And don't eat so much unless
you want to die a virgin.

20:53.962 --> 20:55.054
So.

20:56.173 --> 20:59.143
Each of you
writes down your favorite film

20:59.468 --> 21:02.392
and then make sure
there's a DVD ready for each class.

21:02.721 --> 21:06.476
Is VHS OK? - If the film's
not on DVD, it sucks.

21:06.975 --> 21:08.227
I couldn't give a shit

21:08.685 --> 21:11.734
about old B&W films
collected by your Nazi grandparents.

21:12.481 --> 21:13.983
That one's cool.

21:15.942 --> 21:16.989
Take a picture.

21:17.569 --> 21:20.823
Good morning. I'm Ms. Schnabelstedt.
- Ms. Schnabel-spaz.

21:30.665 --> 21:32.167
What a dog!

21:34.669 --> 21:35.841
Take your seats, please?

21:42.302 --> 21:43.349
What she want now?

21:44.262 --> 21:46.356
My dears,
I know a lot has happened,

21:46.681 --> 21:49.434
but perhaps you could ...
- How old are you anyway?

21:50.519 --> 21:52.613
12?
- How do you feel about

21:52.896 --> 21:55.024
using my proper name. Could you try?

21:55.357 --> 21:57.075
How about you suck me off?

22:03.490 --> 22:06.835
Some of you are surely wondering
why Ms. Leimbach-Knorr did it.

22:07.160 --> 22:09.413
Nope. - So that's
what we'll talk about today.

22:09.788 --> 22:11.756
I brought a Freudenberger essay to help.

22:12.082 --> 22:13.925
Zeynep, give me my nail polish!

22:14.251 --> 22:17.004
Stop yelling.- I didn't yell.
Shut up and give it back.

22:17.337 --> 22:18.634
Fuck you. Take it.

22:19.339 --> 22:21.888
Unbelievably bad upbringing.
- Yeah, you!

22:22.217 --> 22:25.437
Each time you use the F word,
you'll put a euro in the little frog.

22:26.805 --> 22:28.057
She's annoying.

22:28.390 --> 22:31.564
Pass the text around please
and then we can talk about

22:32.143 --> 22:34.145
what a burn-out really is.

22:34.479 --> 22:37.323
What's your name again?
Could you put it on the board?

22:43.029 --> 22:45.248
OK, I get it. You're very creative.

22:46.992 --> 22:48.414
Take cover.

23:13.935 --> 23:17.189
What's up? - When do we elect
our class representative?

23:19.024 --> 23:20.822
Who wants to be
class representative?

23:22.861 --> 23:26.411
I don't want any nerds here, got it?
I'm marking you all down a grade.

23:28.700 --> 23:30.794
Now paint something
until the TV gets here.

23:34.497 --> 23:38.172
Can we brush? - You can pierce
yourself if you want. I don't care.

23:38.960 --> 23:41.008
And can we use opaque white?

23:41.838 --> 23:44.717
We're not really allowed to use
opaque white. - Then DON'T!

23:46.968 --> 23:48.345
Spastic.

24:01.358 --> 24:03.827
Hey guys, it's not funny anymore.
It burns my eyes.

24:09.115 --> 24:11.117
You were supposed to pass those out!

24:12.494 --> 24:14.121
Close the damn window!

24:23.213 --> 24:24.465
Good bye!

24:39.646 --> 24:41.944
Would anybody like to share
10b homeroom duties?

24:42.273 --> 24:44.867
Express yourself.
I don't understand sniveling.

24:47.070 --> 24:50.040
Well, just because they're ...
they're a little ...

24:50.365 --> 24:51.787
Already in over your head?

24:52.117 --> 24:53.460
Right, there's the door.

24:53.785 --> 24:56.880
I don't want staff jumping
out the window because they realize

24:57.288 --> 24:59.336
this profession is no petting zoo.

25:01.001 --> 25:02.048
OK.

25:02.669 --> 25:04.546
Hey, what happened?

25:05.130 --> 25:08.885
Nothing ... they just ...
made such a fool of me.

25:12.053 --> 25:13.225
What?

25:19.269 --> 25:21.772
WE NEED BRIGHT BULBS
FOR OUR SCIENCE FAIR.

25:48.965 --> 25:49.966
MAINTENANCE

26:06.399 --> 26:10.529
Did you know
that they call 10b the amok class?

26:11.279 --> 26:15.910
Yeah. it's the shithead Daniel.
He's got a screw loose.

26:16.534 --> 26:19.333
Did you know they make
bulletproof vests for teachers now?

26:19.871 --> 26:21.748
Thin ones, y'know?
They don't show.

26:23.750 --> 26:25.172
The printer's not working.

26:25.627 --> 26:30.303
You have to unplug it
and plug it back in.

26:35.428 --> 26:38.181
You said you got an A-
on the teacher's exam.

26:38.556 --> 26:39.933
But you got an A.

26:40.266 --> 26:42.143
That's perverse. You're a real geek.

26:42.477 --> 26:46.448
Caro, why are you printing
my exam results?

26:53.696 --> 26:56.575
Monday. Miller was here.
- No way!

27:37.323 --> 27:38.449
Pig!

28:09.939 --> 28:12.818
Unfortunately, you chose
a very slim tree to hide behind.

28:14.611 --> 28:16.079
You stole my exam results!

28:16.404 --> 28:18.247
Have you been sniffing white-out?

28:20.575 --> 28:21.747
Printer cache!

28:22.076 --> 28:24.829
I had problems at uni.
I needed the job. Calm down.

28:25.163 --> 28:28.337
It's theft and fraud.
And you exploited me sexually.

28:28.666 --> 28:31.340
I put a few knockout drops
in your bug tea.

28:31.669 --> 28:35.390
I wouldn't touch you with 10-foot pole.
So stop babbling. - Excuse me?!

28:37.258 --> 28:39.886
You're such an ass.
You're an ass and an imposter.

28:40.470 --> 28:42.768
And that's a crime.
I'm calling the police.

28:46.559 --> 28:47.685
Lighter than expected.

28:49.896 --> 28:51.990
Let go of me.
- Listen, munchkin,

28:52.440 --> 28:56.240
I suggest you cuddle with your teddy
bears overnight, and decide your price.

28:57.820 --> 28:59.572
Don't suck with me, Zeki Miller.

29:00.406 --> 29:04.081
It's "don't fuck with me",
and I won't unless I'm brain dead.

29:10.083 --> 29:11.300
What are you doing there?

29:11.626 --> 29:13.128
None of your fucking business.

29:16.256 --> 29:18.258
We'll see
what Ms. Gerster says tomorrow.

29:18.591 --> 29:20.434
You want money, Schnabelstedt?

29:20.802 --> 29:22.975
I don't want anything,
except my class back.

29:28.309 --> 29:30.437
Swap? Why?

29:31.062 --> 29:35.192
I have training
in conflict resolution and a

29:37.610 --> 29:40.329
... a night course in aggression.
- Yeah, that too.

29:42.323 --> 29:46.749
I've planned it all so well.
I would hate to change it around.

29:47.078 --> 29:50.548
I was angry at first that he wanted
to rob me of such a great challenge,

29:50.873 --> 29:53.877
but then I realized
it's best for the children.

30:00.049 --> 30:03.519
Fireman teachers are usually
the tougher nuts, eh?

30:08.099 --> 30:09.146
Good luck.

30:09.475 --> 30:12.149
Bite me. They're fucking kids.
They can kiss my ass.

30:25.241 --> 30:27.243
I am substituting
for Ms. Schnabelstedt.

30:27.785 --> 30:29.833
My name is Miller
and I'm only a temp.

30:30.163 --> 30:32.712
Why's your name Miller?
You don't look like a Miller.

30:33.041 --> 30:35.715
You're a brother!
- Cut the Turko shit. An F for you.

30:36.044 --> 30:38.342
Where's the class register?
- In the cupboard.

30:56.564 --> 30:59.568
Think I'm going to cry now?
Fucking children.

31:03.404 --> 31:05.156
Let's see who you motherfuckers are.

31:07.575 --> 31:08.952
Chantal Ackermann?

31:13.456 --> 31:16.551
OK, I'm going for a smoke
before I smash your teeth in.

32:16.769 --> 32:18.988
Motherfuckers!

32:25.820 --> 32:30.041
Mr. Miller, class is in session.
Where are you going?

32:32.618 --> 32:34.336
Maybe to change my clothes?!

32:34.662 --> 32:36.335
To the principal's office, please.

32:40.668 --> 32:42.762
You didn't tell me
they were the asocials.

32:43.087 --> 32:45.715
Excuse me?!
What kind of term is that?

32:46.132 --> 32:48.806
You mean youth
from the under-educated class.

32:49.469 --> 32:52.939
Mr. Miller, I want those children
brought under control.

32:53.264 --> 32:56.484
School inspectors could show up
at any time and give out demerits.

32:56.851 --> 32:59.024
You may go change,
but this is an exception.

33:01.022 --> 33:02.365
Thank you!

33:14.076 --> 33:15.248
Show off your ass.

33:17.371 --> 33:18.623
That looks sexy.

34:03.751 --> 34:07.255
Where are the others? - Downstairs,
I think. - They're not in the mood.

34:17.931 --> 34:20.650
Class has started!
- What does he want?

34:21.018 --> 34:23.817
Idiot! - Old fart.
He should go home. - Pathetic.

34:24.981 --> 34:26.402
OMG, you're bleeding.

34:28.400 --> 34:32.326
This is a Forever 21, you retard!
It's gonna stain.

34:34.156 --> 34:35.703
I swear he's crazy. Let's go.

34:36.033 --> 34:37.956
The classroom and make it quick!

34:46.752 --> 34:47.924
Shit!

34:49.255 --> 34:51.098
You forgot your backpack.

34:53.801 --> 34:55.643
Everybody up here, chop-chop!

34:57.638 --> 34:59.515
Now we know who's in command here.

34:59.849 --> 35:03.023
As of now, get your asses in here
at the bell and no trouble.

35:03.352 --> 35:05.275
Now what? We didn't do homework.

35:05.563 --> 35:08.567
I don't give a shit. You sit here.
The rest isn't my problem.

35:09.483 --> 35:13.329
Here's the deal. You all fail in a few
weeks, anyway. Until then, no trouble.

35:14.280 --> 35:15.577
You're the loser class.

35:15.948 --> 35:17.950
The whole teacher's lounge
slags you off.

35:18.367 --> 35:20.870
I can do whatever I want here,
nobody cares.

35:21.370 --> 35:22.542
You're scum.

35:23.956 --> 35:26.550
So shut your mouths
and sit still until the bell.

35:28.544 --> 35:29.591
Excuse me.

35:30.838 --> 35:32.966
Do you have any chalk?
- Look yourself.

35:39.055 --> 35:40.398
Your student is crying.

35:42.099 --> 35:43.146
Chantal!

35:44.352 --> 35:45.899
Yes?
- Cry quietly.

35:50.858 --> 35:52.656
Is it possible
you don't care at all?

35:53.027 --> 35:54.074
About what?

35:54.695 --> 35:56.072
About their respect.

35:57.031 --> 35:59.625
Don't you have work to do,
like potato prints?

36:01.118 --> 36:03.041
This here has no educational value.

36:03.371 --> 36:06.250
They look traumatized.
And what's that on their faces?

36:07.249 --> 36:10.924
They were making name tags and smeared.
Now act like a plane and take off.

36:11.253 --> 36:13.381
I'm good at putting myself
in teenage shoes.

36:13.714 --> 36:16.684
How? By subtracting the pole
up your ass and adding Facebook?

36:18.594 --> 36:20.517
You! Laugh at your own jokes.

36:20.971 --> 36:22.439
You need therapy.

36:29.730 --> 36:31.357
Sorry, that wasn't right of me.

36:34.985 --> 36:36.658
ROCK DRILL

36:47.915 --> 36:48.916
Yes?

36:49.917 --> 36:51.794
I told you
when the old lady got back,

36:52.128 --> 36:54.256
I'd need the booth.
- Where'm I gonna sleep?

36:54.588 --> 36:57.762
It's only a matter of time
before the cops are back on your ass.

36:58.092 --> 37:01.096
Keep me out of it.
I run a clean establishment.

37:02.430 --> 37:04.603
You've got an LSD lab in the attic.

37:04.932 --> 37:06.900
Exactly.
I have to be twice as careful.

37:17.945 --> 37:18.946
Motherfucker.

37:21.407 --> 37:22.829
Shit.

37:25.578 --> 37:26.921
Shit.

37:36.464 --> 37:40.059
YOU HAVE A FUTURE
WE HAVE A PLAN

38:06.160 --> 38:08.538
Man, Laura, do you have to wear
dad's old shirts?

38:09.205 --> 38:10.206
What do you care?

38:10.539 --> 38:12.917
There's such
nice stuff to wear at your age.

38:13.292 --> 38:15.841
Caro, help me out.
- Elisabeth,

38:16.962 --> 38:20.432
I feel like a lesbian adoptive
mother when you drag me into it.

38:21.509 --> 38:24.638
I need to unwind. - Yes, I see.
That's your second glass.

38:26.055 --> 38:28.604
Yes! And we are not married.

38:33.437 --> 38:36.281
There's somebody in the garden.
- Get the pepper spray!

38:37.316 --> 38:38.317
The pepper Spray!

38:38.651 --> 38:41.074
Laura, in your room, lock the door.
- Dostoyevsky!

38:41.445 --> 38:43.072
That dog is useless!

38:45.991 --> 38:49.040
Remember our self-defense classes.
You hold it like this.

38:52.540 --> 38:54.634
Hit him!
We don't want it!

38:54.959 --> 38:57.462
That sentence is pointless
if we're not being raped.

39:01.173 --> 39:03.050
Who the fuck would rape you!

39:03.676 --> 39:04.723
Zeki?

39:06.053 --> 39:07.600
Were you going to sleep here?

39:08.597 --> 39:09.723
No.

39:10.766 --> 39:13.485
He's a giant asshole,
Caro, I'm telling you.

39:14.103 --> 39:15.901
I think he's nice.
And he's hot.

39:16.230 --> 39:19.325
Plus, I bet he can fix stuff.
This fucking house is big enough.

39:19.650 --> 39:22.779
This "fucking" house is good enough
for you at 50 euros a month!

39:23.237 --> 39:25.160
Even better. So he pays 250.

39:25.489 --> 39:27.787
You'll finally
get contact lenses, Harry Potter.

39:28.117 --> 39:30.540
Glasses look like shit,
I've told you 1000 times.

39:32.079 --> 39:33.547
Got a boyfriend?

39:34.540 --> 39:38.670
Careful, you'll end up
like your sister. - Watch it!

39:39.086 --> 39:40.383
Laura, go upstairs.

39:42.423 --> 39:44.596
One night. We don't have linens.

39:47.803 --> 39:49.100
I'll just finish this.

39:54.727 --> 39:58.197
At least 2 weeks, please.
- Your car has no smog sticker.

39:58.522 --> 40:01.150
I'll pay at month's end.
I'll never find anywhere else.

40:01.483 --> 40:03.656
I don't even know you.
Maybe you'll hurt us.

40:03.986 --> 40:06.364
Living with you for 2 weeks,
I'm the victim here.

40:08.324 --> 40:10.577
Hello, Ms. Schnabelstedt.
- Hello.

40:10.951 --> 40:12.043
Mr. Miller?

40:12.369 --> 40:14.212
Not now. Piss off.

40:14.580 --> 40:15.706
It's about German class.

40:16.040 --> 40:18.259
I could only find
Jurassic Park 1 online,

40:18.584 --> 40:21.007
but on list it says to bring 2.
Is that a problem?

40:21.337 --> 40:24.511
Chantal, on THE list.
Articles aren't optional.

40:24.840 --> 40:26.842
What are you on about?
So, Mr. Miller?

40:27.176 --> 40:28.928
We already watched Jurassic Park.

40:29.261 --> 40:31.104
But so many were in remedial class.

40:31.430 --> 40:35.060
Whatever, just buzz off.
You stink of CK One. - Smells nice, eh?

40:37.144 --> 40:38.942
You can stay for 2 weeks.
- Really?

40:40.147 --> 40:43.151
As long as you really teach 10b
and make sure they improve.

40:43.525 --> 40:45.698
How can I?
- Do your job!

40:47.071 --> 40:51.042
It's up to you. Or I tell Ms. Gerster
that class means movies and terror.

40:59.458 --> 41:00.755
Whoa, Mr. Miller.

41:05.381 --> 41:06.473
Hello.

41:07.132 --> 41:08.850
Can you make change?
- How?

41:11.971 --> 41:13.518
Could you help me get out?

41:21.605 --> 41:23.198
Could you stop please?

41:23.649 --> 41:25.743
That hurts.
- E20 is stuck.

41:27.903 --> 41:29.120
More to the right.

41:31.573 --> 41:33.075
Come on.
- Yeah.

41:39.081 --> 41:40.173
My pleasure.

41:41.375 --> 41:43.548
Are you a teacher?
- Yeah,

41:44.003 --> 41:45.505
but I'm just a temp.

41:49.425 --> 41:51.473
It's going to be another shit day.

41:56.390 --> 41:58.188
Any other furniture you need?

41:58.517 --> 41:59.894
Sorry, not available.

42:00.602 --> 42:02.445
Here. Reading material and syllabus.

42:05.941 --> 42:08.694
How am I supposed
to get mental defectives to read?

42:09.111 --> 42:10.328
Know what?

42:11.280 --> 42:13.203
You need to control Danger and Chantal.

42:13.574 --> 42:15.918
Once you get the leaders,
the others follow.

42:17.578 --> 42:20.627
Need anything else?
- Caro! - What? - Could you come ...

42:21.331 --> 42:23.004
What? - The shelves.

42:24.835 --> 42:26.007
Yup.

42:31.425 --> 42:32.472
SCHILLER "THE ROBBERS"

42:35.304 --> 42:36.476
God, the print's small.

42:40.684 --> 42:42.982
Weapons, drugs, vandalism.

42:45.022 --> 42:46.399
Leaders.

42:48.567 --> 42:49.910
Little motherfuckers.

42:50.694 --> 42:53.243
Did you know
that bees make photosynthesis?

42:53.906 --> 42:56.204
Boy, these students
are really special needs.

42:59.078 --> 43:01.251
Use a plate.
- No, it's fine.

43:01.830 --> 43:04.583
Have to go. Still working nights.
- Where?

43:05.542 --> 43:06.589
In a club.

43:07.211 --> 43:09.760
With real dance music
or that electro-shit?

43:10.172 --> 43:13.176
Right. So long as you get
your lessons prepared.

43:25.395 --> 43:28.023
Why do you always give him
that sexed-up look?

43:28.732 --> 43:31.201
Don't be jealous.
He's too short for me anyway.

43:31.527 --> 43:33.746
To blow him,
I'd have to dig a pit first.

43:34.071 --> 43:35.744
I don't want anything from him!

43:36.532 --> 43:39.661
Hey, once he's in,
it doesn't hurt anymore.

43:39.993 --> 43:42.997
And I guarantee he's a great lay.

43:43.330 --> 43:46.675
By the way, I signed him up
as an assistant for your swim class.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.298
Oh, Caro.
- Hey!

43:51.130 --> 43:53.007
I don't want anything from him.

43:55.759 --> 43:57.853
Daniel! Don't jump from the edge.

43:58.554 --> 44:00.147
But yes!

44:01.932 --> 44:03.058
Very funny.

44:03.642 --> 44:07.192
So, who forgot a suit or
has a doctor's note?

44:11.024 --> 44:12.526
Two laps warm-up, please.

44:31.795 --> 44:35.140
So what do I do?
- Uh, first put out your cigarette.

44:37.551 --> 44:39.929
Then just make sure nobody dies.

44:47.269 --> 44:49.772
Very funny.
- Ms. Schnabelstedt,

44:50.105 --> 44:52.358
such pretty wet hair. Totally cute.

44:53.692 --> 44:54.909
Mr. Miller. No.

44:58.947 --> 45:02.121
You need to do sports. Go on.
10 laps before I let you out.

45:02.576 --> 45:05.125
You can shove your
fake doctor's note up your ass.

45:06.622 --> 45:08.044
You too. Go change.

45:08.415 --> 45:11.009
You're a fascister Mr. Miller.
I hate you.

45:18.800 --> 45:20.052
Mr. Miller!

45:23.096 --> 45:24.598
I wanted to thank you.

45:25.098 --> 45:27.692
Thank me? Really?
Here, in front of everybody?

45:31.855 --> 45:33.027
What for, anyway?

45:35.567 --> 45:37.410
It's the first time
so many took part.

45:38.445 --> 45:39.537
Take that back.

45:39.863 --> 45:42.161
No worries.
- Spaz!

45:46.286 --> 45:47.879
No, you take it.

45:54.378 --> 45:56.051
Calm down.
- You a spaz, bro?

45:56.380 --> 45:58.257
He said I was into her.
- So what?

45:58.674 --> 46:01.848
Hey, man, she's ugly as sin.
Let go of me, you whore.

46:02.177 --> 46:04.350
Daniel, whore is a feminine noun.

46:06.139 --> 46:09.564
Now pull yourself together!
- Leave me alone, you asswipe!

46:17.317 --> 46:18.409
Zeki!

46:21.655 --> 46:23.657
You can't do that.
You can't do that.

46:27.619 --> 46:30.088
I didn't hear the apology!
- Fucker! Fucker!

46:30.998 --> 46:33.126
Are you a teacher?
- Yes, why?

46:38.297 --> 46:39.719
But I'm just a temp.

46:41.466 --> 46:43.093
Sorry, sorry.

46:50.475 --> 46:53.399
Did you just use force with
a student? - I'll tell my father.

46:54.354 --> 46:56.356
You told me
to get him under control.

46:56.898 --> 46:58.115
But not with violence.

46:58.692 --> 47:00.865
They reflect that behavior
outside school!

47:05.490 --> 47:06.662
Daniel.

47:11.163 --> 47:13.882
Be careful. I think
he pissed his pants in the pool.

47:15.042 --> 47:18.421
... so I thought we could
get together? Talk about ...

47:19.796 --> 47:22.049
how that could have happened
with Daniel.

47:22.507 --> 47:23.633
Exactly.

47:24.801 --> 47:26.678
But you haven't yet
filed criminal ...

47:29.681 --> 47:31.683
Me? No, it wasn't me.

47:35.312 --> 47:36.404
I don't want...

47:39.983 --> 47:41.030
Miller.

47:48.784 --> 47:50.081
Yes, OK.

47:52.996 --> 47:53.997
Bye.

47:55.332 --> 47:57.175
So does he want
a parent's conference?

47:58.168 --> 48:01.012
No, he said Daniel's nuts
and I should smack him sometimes,

48:01.338 --> 48:03.215
it's the only way
to get him in line.

48:03.965 --> 48:07.845
We need to get the poor boy
out of that vicious circle.

48:08.387 --> 48:11.687
It's a little late,
but I know a really good Ethiopian.

48:12.015 --> 48:13.892
Good, so talk to him
if he's an expert.

48:14.643 --> 48:16.395
It's a restaurant. I'm hungry.

48:16.853 --> 48:20.278
Ethiopian?
Fly soup and rice pudding?

48:21.900 --> 48:22.901
I need meat, man.

48:26.780 --> 48:29.499
Is that actually allowed,
in traffic, the windshield?

48:38.583 --> 48:40.961
You need to talk
to Daniel again. I'm worried.

48:41.294 --> 48:44.013
I'm collecting their dreams
for the time capsule

48:44.339 --> 48:46.512
that every class buries.

48:47.217 --> 48:48.719
I noticed disturbing things.

48:49.594 --> 48:51.642
Daniel and Burak
want to become criminals.

48:52.180 --> 48:54.979
Is work all you think about?
- It's our responsibility.

48:55.308 --> 48:57.231
But they're other people's children.

48:57.561 --> 48:58.687
Do you like it?

48:59.438 --> 49:00.860
Yes, thanks.

49:02.774 --> 49:06.153
There's sort of an educational oath.
We have a professional duty.

49:07.070 --> 49:09.823
It's bad enough that everybody
thinks teachers are lazy.

49:10.198 --> 49:11.620
I swore to make a difference.

49:11.950 --> 49:15.295
They may be awful,
they're still just children. Excuse me,

49:15.620 --> 49:18.248
but could you maybe switch poles?
If it's no trouble.

49:20.000 --> 49:21.172
OK.

49:21.543 --> 49:25.047
Do you really believe that shit,
there's a sweet flower inside every kid?

49:25.380 --> 49:28.224
I think some kids haven't learned
to believe in themselves,

49:28.884 --> 49:30.477
and don't know right from wrong.

49:30.802 --> 49:34.102
If we don't teach them,
they'll end up in prison or something.

49:36.725 --> 49:40.355
We have one Erection
and one Licking Vagina.

49:44.024 --> 49:45.697
It's edible. Don't be shy.

49:46.193 --> 49:47.319
It's a penis.

49:47.736 --> 49:50.239
Man, you'll never get a guy
that way, really.

49:50.572 --> 49:52.666
They all think you're mega uptight.

49:52.991 --> 49:54.288
Put the dick in your mouth.

49:56.119 --> 49:57.245
Coping with students.

49:57.579 --> 50:01.334
Professional handling of disruption
and discipline conflict. CD 4.

50:01.666 --> 50:03.885
Don't underestimate
the value of role-playing.

50:04.211 --> 50:07.135
Group exercises allow young people
to channel aggression.

50:07.464 --> 50:11.719
Role-playing for indirect review of
behavioral dysfunction,

50:12.052 --> 50:14.350
and lack of self-confidence.

50:19.184 --> 50:21.653
Fucking shit.
- Role-play

50:21.978 --> 50:25.949
gives a problem child free rein
for his feelings, and allows reflection

50:26.274 --> 50:27.901
on his inappropriate behavior.

50:28.652 --> 50:30.871
What exercise'?
I don't want to do an exercise.

50:31.279 --> 50:33.498
Stow that look or I'll slap you silly.

50:33.823 --> 50:34.915
So I'm her husband?

50:35.450 --> 50:38.670
A round of applause - he got it.
- Shut up. You start.

50:38.995 --> 50:41.919
Man, wait a sec.
I have to get into my part.

50:42.541 --> 50:44.509
Oh, my beautiful apartment!

50:44.834 --> 50:47.929
Thank you, darling! How was work?
- Shut your trap. I'm hungry.

50:49.422 --> 50:51.766
Watch your mouth.
We only just got married.

50:52.092 --> 50:53.890
I married you
so there'd be food ready

50:54.219 --> 50:56.347
after I screw sluts all day.

50:57.681 --> 50:59.183
After you screw sluts, huh?

50:59.516 --> 51:02.315
You married me because I'm pretty,
Salak. - Don't push me.

51:02.644 --> 51:03.645
Are you an idiot?

51:04.020 --> 51:06.569
Danger is exaggerating, Mr. Miller.
- Who's Mr. Miller?

51:06.898 --> 51:09.651
Are you shagging some German?
- Show me your cell.

51:10.026 --> 51:12.245
Hey, Danger,
that's not part of the game, man.

51:12.612 --> 51:15.240
Shut up. Go clean
and then you can blow me.

51:15.574 --> 51:17.326
Give me my phone back, spaz.

51:20.996 --> 51:24.000
Are you crazy? Don't hit each other.
Stop being such thugs.

51:24.374 --> 51:26.251
Give me the phone, you fuckface.
- OK.

51:27.794 --> 51:29.421
Daniel, you did a great job.

51:29.754 --> 51:31.677
Have you thought
about the drama club?

51:32.257 --> 51:35.056
They participate
in community youth theater

51:35.552 --> 51:38.476
and it could be
a great new hobby for you,

51:38.805 --> 51:41.900
where you could
have fun and let off steam.

51:43.727 --> 51:46.776
No way! I'm already in school
3 or 4 times a week.

51:50.400 --> 51:51.652
What's your problem?

51:52.152 --> 51:53.369
Fuck school, man.

51:54.112 --> 51:56.114
Watch your mouth, motherfucker.

51:56.990 --> 52:00.369
You seriously believe you want
to become drug dealers or some shit?

52:00.702 --> 52:01.749
Yes we do.

52:02.078 --> 52:04.376
I'd rather collect welfare
than learn that crap.

52:04.748 --> 52:06.546
Come on, school's still on.
Piss off.

52:07.709 --> 52:09.086
Fucking motherfuckers.

52:10.045 --> 52:11.342
Was a stupid idea, sorry.

52:15.050 --> 52:18.680
We could each make â‚¬20,000.
It's an armored car transport.

52:19.012 --> 52:21.515
My cousin's been watching them
for 6 weeks now.

52:22.349 --> 52:23.646
I'm busy on something else.

52:23.975 --> 52:26.694
All you have to do is drive.
Getaway car, Zeki.

52:27.020 --> 52:29.739
Bro, you just got out.
Get a real job.

52:31.316 --> 52:34.911
A little upset? Need a blow job?
- No, not in the mood.

52:35.862 --> 52:38.035
What's the matter?
Were you with Mandy?

52:38.948 --> 52:40.871
Are you oftener
with her than me lately?

52:41.201 --> 52:43.704
No, I wasn't with Mandy.
And it's "more often".

52:44.037 --> 52:47.587
Do you have a crush on the bookworm?
- Leave me alone.

52:47.916 --> 52:49.884
Could you suck me off?
- Sorry.

53:04.474 --> 53:05.521
Zeki.

53:13.274 --> 53:14.776
Turn that off.

53:21.825 --> 53:22.951
What's this?

53:42.595 --> 53:43.847
Elisabeth Schnabelstedt.

53:55.608 --> 53:57.656
Hello. I seriously doubt
this will work

53:57.986 --> 54:01.331
or anybody will be organized enough
to ever dig up this time capsule.

54:01.656 --> 54:05.456
I'm also basically uncomfortable at
the thought of strangers reading this.

54:05.785 --> 54:07.287
But I wish I weren't so fat.

54:07.620 --> 54:10.294
I'd like a love letter
with boxes for "yes, no, maybe".

54:10.623 --> 54:11.875
It's silly, I know.

54:12.459 --> 54:14.678
I want to become a teacher.
It's the only job

54:15.003 --> 54:16.926
where you get kids without getting fat.

54:17.255 --> 54:20.634
And I'd like a smart and honest
boyfriend like Karsten in class 9B.

54:20.967 --> 54:22.640
Elisabeth Schnabelstedt, 8a.

54:33.897 --> 54:35.899
Why didn't I ever win
a trophy like that?

54:36.691 --> 54:39.160
Do you have to win
the math Olympics first?

54:40.111 --> 54:42.034
Or a fucking
badminton tournament?

54:44.991 --> 54:48.746
For the first time, I felt like
the streets robbed me of my childhood.

54:50.121 --> 54:51.498
The streets.

54:51.831 --> 54:54.254
And homeroom teacher,
Ms. Eschmiller, stupid cunt.

54:54.584 --> 54:56.632
Everybody knows
you stole the class money!

54:57.003 --> 54:59.176
You'll never amount to anything!

54:59.506 --> 55:01.634
That was surely
not the last foster family

55:02.008 --> 55:05.262
that wants to get rid of you,
Zeki Miller!

55:28.368 --> 55:29.620
School over already?

55:45.260 --> 55:46.557
'Scuse me, 'scuse me.

55:51.766 --> 55:54.189
Are you out of your mind?
- Why?

55:58.147 --> 55:59.490
SLUT

55:59.816 --> 56:01.284
Hey, did they pierce my ears?

56:02.318 --> 56:04.412
Could you please tell me
how that happened?

56:04.779 --> 56:06.531
Where you sleeping in class?

56:16.708 --> 56:18.710
How about peeing INTO the urinal.

56:19.168 --> 56:20.511
Yeah, yeah.

56:24.632 --> 56:25.849
Check your butt.

56:30.054 --> 56:31.101
ASSHOLE

56:31.639 --> 56:33.892
How drunk were you not to notice?

56:34.225 --> 56:35.568
One, two beers?

56:36.269 --> 56:37.771
Yeah.
- Fuck.

56:38.313 --> 56:39.940
Let's not use that word in class.

56:42.066 --> 56:43.113
Are you alright?

56:43.443 --> 56:45.616
Man, just piss off, OK?

56:45.945 --> 56:49.825
You're just worried I'll be busted
and you get the shitty 10b back.

56:50.199 --> 56:52.668
Don't pretend you care.
- You're nuts.

56:52.994 --> 56:55.793
Are you really accusing me
of not caring about you?

56:56.956 --> 56:58.958
I'm really sorry
you're depressed ...

56:59.292 --> 57:00.919
I am not a teacher at all.

57:01.502 --> 57:03.596
Don't start doubting everything.

57:04.130 --> 57:05.256
Hello ...

57:06.382 --> 57:09.386
Your class isn't easy, but I mean,
you chose the job,

57:10.011 --> 57:11.638
so now just stay the course.

57:12.096 --> 57:14.224
Now, go home.
You look like a junkie.

57:15.767 --> 57:18.987
And think about how
to turn your profession into a vocation.

57:19.312 --> 57:20.859
You do have the potential.

57:21.189 --> 57:22.862
You are close to your students.

57:23.942 --> 57:25.785
Including in consuming intoxicants.

57:29.072 --> 57:30.415
Your eyeliner,

57:31.449 --> 57:33.747
it's really perfect.
Gotta give Chantal credit.

57:38.289 --> 57:39.336
So.

57:41.084 --> 57:42.131
Yeah.

57:45.338 --> 57:49.013
I don't know, Laura. Razor blades.
I saw something on TV about it.

57:49.342 --> 57:51.515
It makes a huge mess
in the bathroom.

57:52.136 --> 57:53.683
All that blood.

57:54.013 --> 57:57.813
Right, then we'll try
the plastic bags. Press down hard.

57:58.142 --> 57:59.769
This method definitely sucks.

58:00.103 --> 58:02.322
I'd take pills.
Somebody's here!

58:02.772 --> 58:04.615
Why do you have a bag
over your head?

58:04.983 --> 58:06.860
New profile pictures for Facebook.

58:07.276 --> 58:09.529
Fuck, bro, are you shitting me?
And you too?

58:10.238 --> 58:13.458
Were you trying to kill yourselves?
- Please don't tell my parents.

58:14.409 --> 58:17.583
Mr. Miller, please.
- We just wanted to try.

58:18.538 --> 58:20.586
Because if we do do it,
it'll be together.

58:21.124 --> 58:24.003
I didn't want to. You roped me in.

58:24.585 --> 58:26.258
You said yourself you feel ugly.

58:26.587 --> 58:30.433
But you started with the suicide.
Because you're in love with Daniel.

58:30.758 --> 58:32.977
Man, Maike, you're so bitchy.

58:35.388 --> 58:38.312
So nobody wants to fuck you.
No reason to kill yourself.

58:38.641 --> 58:40.939
I would've written a farewell note.

58:41.269 --> 58:43.738
And then Daniel
would've come to my funeral

58:44.063 --> 58:45.986
and said
he always had feelings for me

58:46.315 --> 58:48.238
and that he was
too blind to realize it.

58:48.860 --> 58:51.989
So stop walking around like
a trannie waiting for the operation.

58:52.321 --> 58:53.447
You're not that ugly.

58:53.781 --> 58:54.873
Yes I am.

59:06.627 --> 59:08.971
NO IDEA WHERE WE'RE GOING.
HE'S STEALING GAS.

59:16.179 --> 59:17.977
Hey, girls.
- Hi, Zeki.

59:18.890 --> 59:20.984
Charlie, can you do
something with her?

59:21.476 --> 59:23.444
We don't do surgery here.

59:26.689 --> 59:28.407
No sense of humor, eh?

59:29.108 --> 59:30.280
Runs in the family.

59:38.785 --> 59:39.957
She needs a big push.

59:40.453 --> 59:42.205
Sheila, bring my make-up bag!

59:42.538 --> 59:44.165
She's a whore, she knows style.

59:45.416 --> 59:47.714
Do you want a drink, or a line?
- No thanks.

59:48.086 --> 59:50.214
No, no. The big one. The big one.

59:50.630 --> 59:52.007
Sweet. Still so young

59:52.381 --> 59:54.099
and fresh.
- Yeah, yeah.

59:58.763 --> 01:00:00.015
I don't look awful?

01:00:28.167 --> 01:00:29.293
Danger!

01:00:32.171 --> 01:00:33.639
She looks great. Today.

01:00:35.466 --> 01:00:38.015
Hey, what?
- Danger, Chantal,

01:00:38.344 --> 01:00:41.097
come here! - What does he want?
- Take this. - Go on.

01:00:43.641 --> 01:00:44.733
Little bitch.

01:00:46.686 --> 01:00:47.983
What's up, Mr. Miller?

01:00:48.312 --> 01:00:49.609
I still owe you something.

01:00:50.106 --> 01:00:51.153
What?

01:00:51.482 --> 01:00:54.702
Some make-up.
- Man, Mr. Miller.

01:00:55.403 --> 01:00:57.030
Danger. - Really!
- Yes?

01:00:57.697 --> 01:01:00.166
You know your dad said I could
slap you around?

01:01:00.533 --> 01:01:02.376
But you're not really going to,
right?

01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:05.083
If you make sure
she's home on time, then no.

01:01:05.454 --> 01:01:06.797
What is this!?

01:01:07.248 --> 01:01:09.922
Can she smoke something?
Oh, you motherfucker!

01:01:10.668 --> 01:01:13.171
Honestly, you're borderlining,
you brainsicker.

01:01:13.504 --> 01:01:14.756
Shut it.

01:01:15.256 --> 01:01:17.759
On time tomorrow
or expect trouble, people. - Fuck.

01:01:18.593 --> 01:01:19.685
Yes.

01:01:20.803 --> 01:01:23.397
Danger, you spaz,
why are you brown-nosing him?

01:01:23.723 --> 01:01:26.567
Did he call my father or yours?
- Who gives a fuck.

01:01:27.185 --> 01:01:29.938
Look at you, embarrassing.
- Shut up.

01:01:30.479 --> 01:01:32.777
What is this anyway?
Not his shit, I hope.

01:01:36.319 --> 01:01:38.947
Punctually tomorrow, people?

01:01:50.374 --> 01:01:51.751
This plant drives me crazy.

01:01:53.711 --> 01:01:55.384
Oh, Mr. Miller, hang on.

01:01:56.047 --> 01:01:58.470
The learning assessment
for class 10b is in.

01:01:59.008 --> 01:02:00.635
The results were as expected.

01:02:01.469 --> 01:02:03.813
The class is an intellectual vacuum.

01:02:04.513 --> 01:02:06.515
Don't be gentle in breaking it to them.

01:02:06.849 --> 01:02:09.398
This is their last chance
to get it together.

01:02:11.103 --> 01:02:12.320
God, is she dumb.

01:02:16.859 --> 01:02:18.532
Ms. Gerster?
- Yes?

01:02:19.111 --> 01:02:21.705
Where are the forms for study trips?
- What?

01:02:22.448 --> 01:02:25.372
A field outing?
- What? - A study outing?

01:02:25.701 --> 01:02:26.748
A field trip?

01:02:28.162 --> 01:02:30.130
Where are we going?
- Disneyland?

01:02:30.456 --> 01:02:32.800
Not a concentration camp again.
- Shut up.

01:02:33.334 --> 01:02:35.507
Chantal, you write the report.
- Nooo.

01:02:38.339 --> 01:02:40.137
Today we took a field trip.

01:02:41.676 --> 01:02:44.520
First we visited an acquaintance
of Mr. Miller's

01:02:45.012 --> 01:02:46.434
who is going cold turkey.

01:02:48.641 --> 01:02:50.018
Hey you, long time no see.

01:02:50.559 --> 01:02:53.984
So, people, some of you said
you wanted to become drug bosses.

01:02:54.313 --> 01:02:57.738
So this is what drug dependence
looks like. This is a heroin addict.

01:02:58.067 --> 01:02:59.660
How long were you a drug addict?

01:03:00.403 --> 01:03:02.906
He can't answer;
shooting up fried his brain.

01:03:04.073 --> 01:03:06.997
He puked the whole time
and Zeynep almost puked too.

01:03:07.326 --> 01:03:09.920
Who wanted to be a drug dealer?
- Not anymore, right?

01:03:10.454 --> 01:03:13.503
Then we went to the parents
of a friend of Mr. Miller's,

01:03:13.833 --> 01:03:16.131
so Daniel could see
a life on welfare.

01:03:16.502 --> 01:03:17.503
Who's there?

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:19.172
The friend is a whore.

01:03:20.798 --> 01:03:22.220
Hey, Zeki, you back?

01:03:22.550 --> 01:03:25.144
Could we come in?
These jokers have a few questions.

01:03:26.887 --> 01:03:29.731
Udo, get dressed!
There are children here. Chico!

01:03:30.308 --> 01:03:32.686
Chantal, is that your mother?
- Are you retarded!

01:03:35.062 --> 01:03:36.359
Udo, how's it hanging?

01:03:36.731 --> 01:03:38.153
Yeah. You?

01:03:38.482 --> 01:03:40.860
OK.
- He sleeps a lot.

01:03:41.610 --> 01:03:43.237
You cuties ...
- It stinks here.

01:03:43.571 --> 01:03:46.541
... do something with your life.
My daughter is a prostitute

01:03:46.866 --> 01:03:48.288
and we're dependent on her.

01:03:48.617 --> 01:03:50.039
It's not nice.

01:03:50.453 --> 01:03:52.000
The dog's shitting - Udo!

01:03:55.583 --> 01:03:56.709
Who cares.

01:03:57.710 --> 01:04:00.008
The prostitute has a brother.
His name is Ronny.

01:04:01.088 --> 01:04:02.214
Ronny was sleeping

01:04:02.548 --> 01:04:05.347
because he drinks a lot
and he's a Nazi.

01:04:05.718 --> 01:04:09.814
They are up all night, so nobody
wanted Mr. Miller to wake him.

01:04:10.264 --> 01:04:11.686
Don't wake him up, please.

01:04:12.016 --> 01:04:14.690
Burak wants to avoid
first contact with a Nazi.

01:04:15.019 --> 01:04:17.397
Then you need
to join the theater group.

01:04:18.522 --> 01:04:20.240
Bro, say yes.
- Yeah, OK, man.

01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:22.277
Leave his damn nipple alone.

01:04:22.610 --> 01:04:25.830
It was very interesting.
Mr. Miller has weird friends.

01:04:26.155 --> 01:04:27.623
Afterwards, we all got kebabs.

01:04:27.948 --> 01:04:30.167
It was better than a museum
with Mr. Gundlach.

01:04:30.493 --> 01:04:32.746
That was just
a bunch of stuffed animals.

01:04:35.414 --> 01:04:36.461
It's red.

01:04:36.791 --> 01:04:39.044
They haven't learned
the colors yet. - Asshole.

01:04:39.418 --> 01:04:41.716
Asshole.

01:04:42.046 --> 01:04:44.048
So think about
what you want to become.

01:04:44.382 --> 01:04:46.259
Come up with your own homework.

01:04:48.135 --> 01:04:49.136
Give me one.

01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:53.607
Oh come on, Mr. Miller.

01:04:53.933 --> 01:04:56.277
Smoking sucks.
- Nuts.

01:04:58.104 --> 01:05:00.027
About the test you took recently.

01:05:01.315 --> 01:05:02.316
You were the best.

01:05:02.817 --> 01:05:04.740
You might even skip a grade.

01:05:05.736 --> 01:05:07.989
But I got a terrible grade,
Mr. Miller.

01:05:08.322 --> 01:05:11.121
Because you're under-challenged.
Talented people often are.

01:05:11.534 --> 01:05:15.835
As of now, you'll be challenged.
Could be you even graduate at 17.

01:05:16.163 --> 01:05:17.335
Oh, my god.

01:05:17.706 --> 01:05:20.209
But don't let yourself
be dragged down by others

01:05:20.543 --> 01:05:21.590
and apply yourself.

01:05:21.919 --> 01:05:23.466
Does he mean me?
- No.

01:05:23.796 --> 01:05:27.471
Mr. Miller, really? You're not joking?
Look, I'm trembling.

01:05:27.842 --> 01:05:29.014
I'm excited myself.

01:05:29.385 --> 01:05:31.604
You only see
somebody like you every 10 years.

01:05:31.971 --> 01:05:35.396
My god.
I don't have to be a check-out girl.

01:05:36.892 --> 01:05:40.146
Who are they? - The vocationals
are ripping off the disabled kids.

01:05:40.563 --> 01:05:42.565
They don't look more disabled than you.

01:05:42.898 --> 01:05:44.866
Whatever. Nerds, science fair types.

01:05:47.069 --> 01:05:49.413
Go help them.
- Why?

01:05:49.989 --> 01:05:51.741
Because you'll be a nerd soon.

01:05:52.074 --> 01:05:54.247
Because they're the only men
who'll like you,

01:05:54.577 --> 01:05:57.877
a chem student in a lab coat
with liverwurst stains and greasy hair.

01:05:58.205 --> 01:06:00.207
I swear, Mr. Miller,
you're killing me.

01:06:01.083 --> 01:06:02.209
OK, let's kick ass.

01:06:03.002 --> 01:06:05.721
Chantal,
not in the mood for a fight

01:06:07.381 --> 01:06:08.382
Leave them alone.

01:06:08.716 --> 01:06:12.346
You think you're better than us? - They
go to my school. Leave them alone ...

01:06:13.304 --> 01:06:14.396
Let go!

01:06:15.723 --> 01:06:18.522
She's got a knife! - Scared?

01:06:21.729 --> 01:06:23.481
Let go, you!
- Piss off, man!

01:06:24.356 --> 01:06:27.280
Touch them again and I'll cut off
your extensions, you cunt.

01:06:27.610 --> 01:06:30.033
No! They were expensive.
- Then piss off.

01:06:30.696 --> 01:06:32.039
You too, outta here!

01:06:32.656 --> 01:06:33.657
Not bad.

01:06:34.909 --> 01:06:36.126
Check!

01:06:37.286 --> 01:06:39.789
Hey nerds.
Say thank you.

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:43.213
The federation guarantees
eternal gratitude.

01:06:43.542 --> 01:06:46.011
Yeah, no prob. I'm smart too, I get it.

01:06:46.337 --> 01:06:47.930
You're in science club, right?

01:06:49.006 --> 01:06:50.053
Positive.

01:06:50.382 --> 01:06:53.352
So maybe I could come see sometime?

01:06:53.677 --> 01:06:57.898
Because in class I'm .. could be
that I'm not challenged enough.

01:07:04.063 --> 01:07:06.282
What're they talking about?
- How would I know.

01:07:06.607 --> 01:07:08.029
I don't want to be that ugly.

01:07:11.862 --> 01:07:14.331
OK. But you have to wear
anti-static clothing.

01:07:15.115 --> 01:07:16.116
OK.

01:07:17.159 --> 01:07:19.457
What's that? What does he mean?

01:07:23.791 --> 01:07:25.714
This isn't the test I gave you.

01:07:26.335 --> 01:07:27.587
I added a question.

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:30.890
In the first person, tell us
how a dinosaur feels when he sees

01:07:31.215 --> 01:07:32.888
the electric fence is off.

01:07:37.263 --> 01:07:41.234
There were only goats today again.
I don't even like goats.

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:44.945
I wonder what's
outside the fence. I hear it's freedom,

01:07:45.437 --> 01:07:47.314
but to get it, you have to die.

01:07:47.773 --> 01:07:50.697
I decided to try
and touched the fence carefully.

01:07:51.068 --> 01:07:52.194
It was weird.

01:07:52.528 --> 01:07:55.498
It didn't hurt. For the first time,
I had something like hope.

01:07:58.409 --> 01:08:00.662
That was beautiful.
What did you do with them?

01:08:01.495 --> 01:08:02.542
Just talked.

01:08:07.585 --> 01:08:09.303
Friday is environment & nature day.

01:08:09.628 --> 01:08:11.801
You could take the class
to an organic farm.

01:08:12.131 --> 01:08:13.849
I've always wanted to go there.

01:08:18.178 --> 01:08:19.475
I could come along.

01:08:20.055 --> 01:08:22.023
Romeo, doff thy name,

01:08:22.349 --> 01:08:25.649
And for that name which is
no part of thee take all myself.

01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:28.648
Why is Daniel trying out for Romeo?

01:08:28.981 --> 01:08:32.576
The other parts are shit. Go on.
- But I ... - Yeah, yeah. Enough.

01:08:34.862 --> 01:08:38.241
I take thee at thy word. Call me
but love, and I'll be new baptized;

01:08:38.573 --> 01:08:41.999
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
- Why is he yelling like that?

01:08:42.328 --> 01:08:45.081
He's a little aggressive.
- ... So stumblest on my counsel?

01:08:45.413 --> 01:08:47.542
By a name I know not
how to tell thee who I am:

01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:50.551
My name, dear saint,
is hateful to myself,

01:08:50.877 --> 01:08:53.381
Because it is an enemy to thee;

01:08:53.714 --> 01:08:56.263
Had I it written,
I would tear the word.

01:08:57.134 --> 01:08:59.933
My ears have not yet ...
- That's it, I can't take it.

01:09:00.304 --> 01:09:03.353
The balcony scene's next.
- So what? The stage is total shit.

01:09:03.682 --> 01:09:07.185
It looks like that TV channel
you only land on by mistake.

01:09:08.770 --> 01:09:11.319
The one where they speak French.
- Do you mean PBS?

01:09:11.649 --> 01:09:13.492
Yeah, exactly.
Nobody understands it.

01:09:13.859 --> 01:09:16.487
What's the deal
with the stilted language?

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:18.287
My god, it's Shakespeare.

01:09:18.947 --> 01:09:21.166
Who's been dead for,
like, 4000 years.

01:09:21.492 --> 01:09:23.790
Why isn't it translated
into normal German.

01:09:24.118 --> 01:09:26.042
If I were you,
I'd be embarrassed.

01:09:26.412 --> 01:09:27.835
I already want my money back.

01:09:28.165 --> 01:09:31.385
Gundlach is clueless. You'll never win
the teenie Oscars with that.

01:09:31.710 --> 01:09:34.884
I won't listen to this.
I've done this for 24 years,

01:09:35.214 --> 01:09:38.218
since the fall of communism,
and it was always well received.

01:09:38.591 --> 01:09:39.718
In a rest home, maybe.

01:09:40.426 --> 01:09:42.975
Listen here. You do it then.

01:09:43.305 --> 01:09:45.649
Please, you take over directing.

01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:48.064
Arrivederci, Verona!

01:09:48.394 --> 01:09:50.317
My colleague ...
- No, I'm going.

01:09:51.354 --> 01:09:52.823
Can I go too?
- No!

01:09:55.067 --> 01:09:56.614
So who's taking over drama club?

01:10:02.282 --> 01:10:04.535
What's it about?
I only saw the porn version.

01:10:04.868 --> 01:10:06.996
Do they get each other?
- They die.

01:10:07.454 --> 01:10:08.501
At least that.

01:10:09.123 --> 01:10:10.340
Who are you playing?

01:10:10.791 --> 01:10:11.838
The nurse.

01:10:12.710 --> 01:10:15.714
What's that, an animal?
- It's a great role.

01:10:17.673 --> 01:10:20.267
Daniel, say that the way
you'd say it.

01:10:21.468 --> 01:10:23.345
Julia, you cunt, let's fuck.

01:10:23.679 --> 01:10:26.979
Show me your tits, pronto.
- We'll re-write it. It'll be cool.

01:10:33.689 --> 01:10:34.941
Close.

01:11:16.815 --> 01:11:19.989
Sarafina, be careful.
You'll fall again.

01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:22.237
The teacher ratings are online.

01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:24.908
And we are VERY interested in that.

01:11:27.367 --> 01:11:31.292
My dears, the teacher ratings
have been posted. Online!

01:11:32.164 --> 01:11:33.336
Breathe deep.

01:11:35.626 --> 01:11:37.094
Hottest teacher -

01:11:38.796 --> 01:11:39.888
me.

01:11:40.839 --> 01:11:43.137
Yes. Ms. Gerster.
- Yes?

01:11:43.634 --> 01:11:45.181
You are the biggest nightmare.

01:11:45.636 --> 01:11:48.264
I said I'd get the title back -
Alrun.

01:11:48.806 --> 01:11:49.978
Who's coolest teacher?

01:11:51.558 --> 01:11:52.650
Mr. Miller.

01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:56.363
And, who's the sweetest teacher?

01:11:58.982 --> 01:12:00.154
Mr. Miller ...

01:12:02.444 --> 01:12:03.787
and among the women.

01:12:05.697 --> 01:12:07.950
Oh, Me. Hey there, surprise!

01:12:09.076 --> 01:12:11.170
Congratulations.
- We'll drink to that, eh?

01:12:11.995 --> 01:12:14.669
No, I need to go get
the overhead projector.

01:12:14.998 --> 01:12:16.045
Go ahead.

01:12:17.876 --> 01:12:18.923
So, I said ...

01:12:23.882 --> 01:12:26.601
You're not seriously crying
over no student ranking?

01:12:26.927 --> 01:12:28.224
A student RATING.

01:12:29.429 --> 01:12:32.683
I'll never be voted most anything.
I've never been anything,

01:12:33.016 --> 01:12:37.066
most beloved teacher, prettiest teacher,
teacher with the nicest smile, nothing.

01:12:37.479 --> 01:12:40.904
I've never even been
strictest teacher or meanest teacher.

01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:42.492
I'm just air.

01:12:46.196 --> 01:12:49.291
Who gives a shit if they like you.
- It matters.

01:12:49.658 --> 01:12:53.208
It's a compliment, the only review
of us. The only one that counts.

01:12:53.537 --> 01:12:55.255
What the students think counts.

01:12:57.082 --> 01:12:59.801
They think you're funny, that's why.
- You mean witty?

01:13:00.210 --> 01:13:01.712
There's no category for that.

01:13:02.379 --> 01:13:03.676
Couldn't you talk to them?

01:13:04.006 --> 01:13:05.974
Gerster is making me
test the b class,

01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:08.302
because so many of mine have mumps.

01:13:08.844 --> 01:13:10.061
They're going to ...

01:13:10.888 --> 01:13:11.889
... to whack me.

01:13:12.431 --> 01:13:15.355
It'll all be deducted from
my final grade, if I mess it up.

01:13:15.726 --> 01:13:16.898
I could blackmail them.

01:13:17.227 --> 01:13:21.073
No! I want them to respect me.
By choice.

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:22.566
Nobody says whack.

01:13:28.614 --> 01:13:29.866
But YOLO is OK, right?

01:13:32.701 --> 01:13:35.250
Ms. Schnabelstedt wants to
do a wholetrain with you.

01:13:36.246 --> 01:13:37.543
What does wholetrain mean?

01:13:37.873 --> 01:13:39.341
We spray the entire train.

01:13:39.666 --> 01:13:41.714
The entire train? What about the law?

01:13:42.044 --> 01:13:43.637
That's exactly why it's cool.

01:13:43.962 --> 01:13:45.885
The beautiful train, it's brand new.

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:50.723
Excuse me, we have class here now.

01:13:51.762 --> 01:13:53.856
This is our train.
We could call the police,

01:13:54.181 --> 01:13:56.058
or you could just move over one track.

01:13:56.391 --> 01:13:59.440
I need to finish here on time.
I'm not here for fun.

01:14:03.982 --> 01:14:05.199
See.

01:14:26.004 --> 01:14:28.302
Danger, come here. Not bad.

01:14:29.841 --> 01:14:32.390
Totally PHAT, Ms. Schnabelstedt.
Totally Instagram.

01:14:33.637 --> 01:14:34.684
Thanks.

01:14:36.306 --> 01:14:40.436
So, shall we look at your work
and critique it together?

01:14:41.853 --> 01:14:43.150
Swag, eh?

01:14:44.231 --> 01:14:45.904
Swag-etti yolognese, Burak.

01:14:50.529 --> 01:14:52.873
Good thing
you're not in my English class.

01:14:54.366 --> 01:14:56.164
How would you grade it, Burak?

01:14:56.535 --> 01:14:58.754
Hey, an A, of course.
- Dunno about that.

01:14:59.079 --> 01:15:01.548
Shit. Cops. Scramble.
- Police! Halt!

01:15:10.173 --> 01:15:11.174
Come on.

01:15:24.396 --> 01:15:25.522
OK.

01:15:31.278 --> 01:15:34.157
That's not the first time
you've run from the police, is it?

01:15:36.324 --> 01:15:37.701
I stole a CD once.

01:15:44.416 --> 01:15:46.635
That's special waste.
For a recycling station.

01:15:47.919 --> 01:15:50.468
What about some thanks
for polishing your image?

01:15:55.093 --> 01:15:56.936
I swear, that was close, Mr. Miller.

01:15:57.304 --> 01:15:59.102
I almost saw teacher sex.

01:16:06.646 --> 01:16:08.273
Hey there.

01:16:09.149 --> 01:16:11.652
Hey, Ms. Schnabelstedt,
teachers' test today, eh?

01:16:12.861 --> 01:16:14.113
Yeah, exactly, Burak.

01:16:15.655 --> 01:16:16.747
Cool.

01:16:17.074 --> 01:16:19.543
Good morning.

01:16:19.868 --> 01:16:23.293
I brought 2 pictures and I'd like
to discuss them in the context

01:16:23.747 --> 01:16:25.215
of Schiller's "The Robbers".

01:16:26.541 --> 01:16:28.589
Can I turn on the projector first?

01:17:05.455 --> 01:17:07.048
Thank you, class.

01:17:09.334 --> 01:17:11.132
Not bad, Ms. Schnabelstedt. Not bad.

01:17:11.753 --> 01:17:14.757
It seems you do have some ability
to assert yourself.

01:17:15.132 --> 01:17:16.725
I'm glad. Good.

01:17:17.259 --> 01:17:18.511
Thank you.

01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:23.523
And why were you so nice?

01:17:23.849 --> 01:17:26.318
Because you and Mr. Miller
are so sweet together.

01:17:26.643 --> 01:17:29.772
If you hooked up it would be so hot.
- Not everything is hot.

01:17:30.105 --> 01:17:31.652
You're so much prettier lately.

01:17:32.232 --> 01:17:35.486
You wear your hair loose and ...
yeah, beautiful.

01:17:37.863 --> 01:17:42.289
Thank god private life and civility
aren't AP subjects. Now go exercise.

01:17:44.619 --> 01:17:47.873
Chantal, don't light up inside.
- Yeah, OK.

01:17:53.545 --> 01:17:55.889
Ms. Schnabelstedt.
He's shooting the animals.

01:17:56.214 --> 01:17:59.889
No, they're sex hormones. It's always
hard to get Llamas in mating mood.

01:18:00.218 --> 01:18:01.811
It's too cold for them here.

01:18:02.345 --> 01:18:06.771
I thought this was an organic farm.
I don't quite get the organic aspect.

01:18:07.559 --> 01:18:11.189
OK, kids, let's move on to the rabbits
so you can sketch them.

01:18:13.064 --> 01:18:16.034
This is disgusting. - Let's zap
Chantal with it. - Cool.

01:18:22.657 --> 01:18:23.704
Hey, Chantal.

01:18:24.117 --> 01:18:26.040
No, stop, you spaz! No!

01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:35.800
Was that in your ass? - I was trying
to hit Chantal, I swear.

01:18:37.422 --> 01:18:38.514
Zeki, where are you?

01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:41.844
First, it's outrageous
that you left me alone with your class.

01:18:42.177 --> 01:18:44.100
And second, I've been shot with ...

01:18:44.429 --> 01:18:47.057
... ungulate.
- ... ungulate sex hormones

01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:50.690
and I would like to see a doctor.

01:18:51.019 --> 01:18:54.489
I don't think much will happen.
In Asia it's a recreational stimulant.

01:18:54.814 --> 01:18:56.862
In Pandora, eh?
- Oh, god.

01:18:57.192 --> 01:18:59.286
Pandora? What are you talking about?

01:18:59.653 --> 01:19:01.280
Pandora is in Asia.

01:19:01.613 --> 01:19:03.456
Pandora doesn't exist in real life.

01:19:03.782 --> 01:19:05.250
So why was it in 3D?

01:19:05.992 --> 01:19:08.245
I'm so hot. I'm so hot.

01:19:08.787 --> 01:19:10.380
I'm so thirsty.

01:19:16.503 --> 01:19:19.973
What's happening to her? - I'm
the hottest teacher in the world.

01:19:22.342 --> 01:19:25.312
I hope I don't grow fur.

01:19:26.513 --> 01:19:31.064
I couldn't stand having to shave
every day, everywhere.

01:19:31.393 --> 01:19:32.895
My back ...

01:19:34.521 --> 01:19:36.364
and my bottom ...

01:19:37.148 --> 01:19:38.320
Chill out, bro.

01:19:44.114 --> 01:19:45.616
Sleep, sleep, sleep ...

01:19:50.453 --> 01:19:52.751
Lisi, the dog was just playing
in a shit pile.

01:19:53.081 --> 01:19:54.128
What are you doing?!

01:19:55.792 --> 01:19:57.794
Sweetie, let me sleep a little.

01:19:58.128 --> 01:19:59.425
Zeki will play with you.

01:20:01.089 --> 01:20:03.717
Child services is coming today,
about my guardianship.

01:20:04.634 --> 01:20:05.886
Doesn't matter.

01:20:08.054 --> 01:20:10.557
Dostoyevsky, let me in there.

01:20:10.890 --> 01:20:12.142
They're already on alert,

01:20:12.517 --> 01:20:15.191
because she was treated
for depression as a teenager.

01:20:15.562 --> 01:20:17.564
Oh, yeah, I was very sad.

01:20:18.565 --> 01:20:21.114
Teenagers are always sad,

01:20:21.526 --> 01:20:23.904
because nobody likes them.

01:20:24.904 --> 01:20:26.906
Have you lost your marbles?

01:20:27.907 --> 01:20:29.580
Thirsty.
- Hey!

01:20:30.035 --> 01:20:33.335
Thanks a lot.
Now I'm going to end up in a home.

01:20:36.041 --> 01:20:37.167
Good night!

01:20:49.512 --> 01:20:51.685
Mr. Miller, my dear god!

01:20:52.474 --> 01:20:54.147
One more won't hurt. Call me Zeki.

01:20:55.060 --> 01:20:56.107
I'm Isolde.

01:20:56.811 --> 01:20:58.813
What a lovely name - I mean yours.

01:20:59.189 --> 01:21:00.532
Are you from the Mideast?

01:21:00.899 --> 01:21:02.617
Yes, but no fear. I won't shoot.

01:21:06.446 --> 01:21:09.245
Hello.
- Ms. Schnabelstedt!

01:21:10.450 --> 01:21:14.296
Your boyfriend just told me
you were hit by a car. Now sit down.

01:21:15.163 --> 01:21:16.380
Are you feeling better?

01:21:18.083 --> 01:21:19.676
Yes, I really wanted to ...

01:21:20.001 --> 01:21:22.424
So, who'd like a piece of cake?

01:21:22.754 --> 01:21:25.348
Now, you are ...
You didn't mention

01:21:25.673 --> 01:21:27.550
you were in a relationship.

01:21:27.967 --> 01:21:29.093
I was doubtful,

01:21:29.427 --> 01:21:31.805
you as sole guardian
for such a young child.

01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:36.184
And you so young yourself.
But your parents would be very proud

01:21:36.518 --> 01:21:40.648
if they could see what a wonderful
environment you've created here.

01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:43.483
Yes, we get along so well.

01:21:44.984 --> 01:21:47.407
Mr. Miller, no more cream.
Oh, my god.

01:21:47.821 --> 01:21:48.913
My figure!

01:21:49.447 --> 01:21:52.417
If anyone can handle it,
you can Ms. Sieberts.

01:21:52.742 --> 01:21:55.586
But we were
on a first name basis, Zeki.

01:21:56.329 --> 01:21:57.330
Of course.

01:21:57.664 --> 01:22:00.793
Now you two lovebirds must tell me
how long you've been together.

01:22:01.459 --> 01:22:02.506
Well ...

01:22:03.086 --> 01:22:04.554
Almost a year.

01:22:04.879 --> 01:22:06.096
We met online.

01:22:06.631 --> 01:22:08.508
Then I quickly
applied at her school,

01:22:08.967 --> 01:22:11.390
so we could spend
more time together.

01:22:13.596 --> 01:22:15.598
I have to say, Ms. Schnabelstedt,

01:22:15.932 --> 01:22:17.980
I am totally charmed
by your partner.

01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:20.778
Plus, he's an educator.

01:22:21.729 --> 01:22:23.356
I really can't complain.

01:22:24.107 --> 01:22:25.404
Jackpot!

01:22:25.859 --> 01:22:28.157
You could even adopt a few more kids!

01:22:28.486 --> 01:22:30.079
Bye-bye, Isolde!
- Bye-bye!

01:22:47.630 --> 01:22:49.098
I assume you want something?

01:22:50.175 --> 01:22:51.301
Forget it.

01:22:52.677 --> 01:22:53.929
So why did you do it?

01:22:59.893 --> 01:23:01.816
Because I know how it feels
to be alone.

01:23:09.736 --> 01:23:10.908
Thank you.

01:23:11.529 --> 01:23:12.872
Still high on llama?

01:23:14.657 --> 01:23:16.625
No, on substitute teacher.

01:23:21.456 --> 01:23:23.424
Man, you know I'm leaving soon!

01:23:36.179 --> 01:23:38.056
You have reached your destination.

01:23:39.849 --> 01:23:41.351
Yeah, where, you bitch?

01:25:39.594 --> 01:25:43.144
1800, 1900, 2000.

01:25:43.473 --> 01:25:44.850
And 50 for the glass table.

01:25:48.019 --> 01:25:49.817
Here. Your new tits.

01:25:51.147 --> 01:25:52.524
Really? Sweet!

01:25:54.901 --> 01:25:57.575
I'll miss you.
- No South America. I can't leave.

01:25:57.987 --> 01:25:59.113
But not on my account?

01:25:59.989 --> 01:26:02.162
We've been friends too long.
It'd never work.

01:26:02.742 --> 01:26:05.211
Because of the ... the kids, man.

01:26:06.162 --> 01:26:07.379
I'm all they've got.

01:26:09.165 --> 01:26:11.167
I didn't know they were all orphans.

01:26:12.293 --> 01:26:14.466
Seriously.
They're completely fixated on me.

01:26:14.962 --> 01:26:17.715
Like little chicks that can only see
their mother's ass

01:26:18.049 --> 01:26:19.517
and follow it everywhere.

01:26:19.884 --> 01:26:21.136
And you're that ass.

01:26:21.636 --> 01:26:24.105
Yeah, exactly.
- An ass with a heart

01:26:26.432 --> 01:26:27.775
Shut it and give me a beer.

01:26:28.101 --> 01:26:30.854
I have to finish "Robbers".
I need to look every word up.

01:26:31.437 --> 01:26:32.563
Is it in English?

01:26:33.523 --> 01:26:34.775
No, German.

01:26:37.443 --> 01:26:38.569
Don't know it, eh?

01:26:49.205 --> 01:26:51.253
So Moor or Spiegelberg?

01:26:51.582 --> 01:26:54.210
Who has a better chance
at middle-class life?

01:26:54.544 --> 01:26:56.342
Karl.
Spiegelberg is completely evil.

01:26:56.671 --> 01:26:58.514
He's already done
too many bad things.

01:26:58.881 --> 01:27:00.599
Karl doesn't want to be evil.

01:27:02.927 --> 01:27:04.725
My god, was that right, Mr. Miller?

01:27:26.075 --> 01:27:27.577
Where is my push-up bra?

01:27:27.910 --> 01:27:31.631
What for? You'll look like a whore
if you squish up your mini-boobs.

01:27:32.081 --> 01:27:33.799
I want my push-up bra!

01:27:34.417 --> 01:27:35.634
Maike!

01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:38.213
The nurse is such a great part.
And so complex.

01:27:38.546 --> 01:27:39.798
Mr. Miller!

01:27:40.548 --> 01:27:43.051
Are you going to grease me up?
- Are you nuts?

01:27:43.634 --> 01:27:45.932
There, ask ... Laura.

01:27:46.262 --> 01:27:47.605
Greta?
- What?

01:27:48.890 --> 01:27:52.440
That was fast. - Listen, I did Romeo
and Juliet once too - the friar.

01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:56.189
It was a little strange at first,
since it was a male role,

01:27:56.522 --> 01:27:58.149
but at some point it's really ...

01:27:59.567 --> 01:28:01.695
Mr. Miller said
you should put my cream on.

01:28:02.737 --> 01:28:03.738
OK.

01:28:09.535 --> 01:28:11.333
I'll just go take my seat.

01:28:13.706 --> 01:28:15.003
You can use more.

01:28:15.666 --> 01:28:18.215
Yeah, you need a lot.

01:28:19.420 --> 01:28:21.388
Yeah, I tried
a new anabolic steroid.

01:28:22.048 --> 01:28:23.766
That's totally unhealthy, you know?

01:28:24.634 --> 01:28:27.888
Really? I've always done it.
Since I was 11.

01:28:28.221 --> 01:28:30.349
Laura, come here please. Now.

01:28:32.183 --> 01:28:34.686
Listen, Schnabelstedt.
Danger is mine.

01:28:35.019 --> 01:28:36.487
He's Romeo and I'm Juliet.

01:28:36.896 --> 01:28:39.445
So stay in the background
or I'll do you in.

01:28:40.066 --> 01:28:41.909
Daniel? could we warm up?

01:28:43.277 --> 01:28:44.574
Go get my energy drink.

01:28:48.115 --> 01:28:49.992
No, Romeo, I told you.

01:28:50.326 --> 01:28:52.704
I'm not a one night stand slut.
- Let me do it.

01:28:59.252 --> 01:29:00.344
Here's your drink.

01:29:03.172 --> 01:29:06.767
Attention, next up are the Leibnitz
School and the Goethe School.

01:29:07.093 --> 01:29:08.811
Children, please get ready.

01:29:15.017 --> 01:29:17.270
I'm nauseous.
- You know Greta's part, right?

01:29:17.603 --> 01:29:19.822
I think so, but ...
- But I'm ...

01:29:24.944 --> 01:29:28.949
Julia. - You'll puke up the whole stage.
I want to win. You go change.

01:29:29.407 --> 01:29:30.750
Shit group.

01:29:32.660 --> 01:29:34.253
But no tongue kissing, right?

01:29:37.582 --> 01:29:38.754
Use your tongue.

01:29:48.342 --> 01:29:49.264
Julia?

01:29:50.386 --> 01:29:51.888
Yeah, what is it?

01:29:52.263 --> 01:29:53.765
Come down, let's chill.

01:29:55.224 --> 01:29:57.101
I can't. I'm grounded.

01:29:57.476 --> 01:29:58.728
That blows.

01:30:01.939 --> 01:30:04.943
She's playing Juliet.
A Schnabelstedt has never done that.

01:30:05.943 --> 01:30:07.286
Whoa, is she dead?

01:30:07.778 --> 01:30:09.746
Why did you overdose?

01:30:10.156 --> 01:30:11.954
Let there be coke left on your lips!

01:30:16.913 --> 01:30:18.039
Don't laugh.

01:30:21.042 --> 01:30:23.010
Then I want to die too!

01:30:38.935 --> 01:30:40.061
Romeo!

01:30:41.354 --> 01:30:42.480
Frigging junkie.

01:30:45.650 --> 01:30:47.323
Fuck, I thought you were dead.

01:30:48.194 --> 01:30:50.196
Didn't you get my text message?
- No, man.

01:30:51.322 --> 01:30:54.417
Then I ran out of credit.
- Girl, I told you pre-paids sucked.

01:30:54.742 --> 01:30:57.291
If only I'd listened to you.
- Yeah, you should have.

01:31:05.336 --> 01:31:07.054
I never thought you'd do it so well.

01:31:07.838 --> 01:31:09.385
It's almost a little subversive.

01:31:10.925 --> 01:31:14.520
And second prize goes to
the drama club of the Goethe School.

01:31:14.845 --> 01:31:16.313
Congratulations.

01:31:24.105 --> 01:31:28.076
Good morning, Ms. Gerster.
- Good mor... thanks, that's fine.

01:31:28.734 --> 01:31:30.862
Our first science fair
showcase in 4 years.

01:31:31.195 --> 01:31:32.572
Since the dog-shit volcano.

01:31:32.989 --> 01:31:34.491
What else are they submitting?

01:31:35.324 --> 01:31:36.416
The robot.

01:31:37.868 --> 01:31:41.088
The teacher can communicate
with the whole class with the camera.

01:31:41.622 --> 01:31:45.593
You shitheads need to start
doing your homework.

01:31:47.128 --> 01:31:49.256
I used Mr. Miller
for the sample sentences.

01:31:50.131 --> 01:31:52.759
Ms. Gerster, now you have to try
the mascara gun.

01:31:54.260 --> 01:31:55.307
Is that OK?

01:31:58.014 --> 01:31:59.391
I made it all by myself.

01:32:01.726 --> 01:32:03.854
Good, great.
Thanks Chantal. That's enough.

01:32:04.186 --> 01:32:05.529
Yes?
- Thanks, yes! Great!

01:32:09.984 --> 01:32:12.362
Sweet, Ms. Gerster.
Total smoky eyes.

01:32:13.404 --> 01:32:14.781
Mr. Miller, we need to talk.

01:32:15.448 --> 01:32:17.200
You're contract's up, you know that?

01:32:17.825 --> 01:32:18.872
Yes, I know.

01:32:19.285 --> 01:32:22.505
Good. I suspect
you're not a bad thing for this school.

01:32:23.330 --> 01:32:24.456
Think about it.

01:32:24.999 --> 01:32:27.252
I could get rid of
Ms. Schnabelstedt instead.

01:32:29.128 --> 01:32:31.802
Don't worry.
Always need a few eager beavers.

01:32:32.882 --> 01:32:34.509
Take this off, please, Chantal.

01:32:37.303 --> 01:32:40.307
I don't know. It was only meant
to be temporary. - Good.

01:32:40.639 --> 01:32:41.811
Your choice.

01:32:42.141 --> 01:32:43.984
Thank you, children. You did well.

01:32:49.523 --> 01:32:53.244
OK, inventions in the car.
We'll head to the fair after school.

01:32:56.822 --> 01:32:57.994
Bye, Mr. Miller.

01:33:10.002 --> 01:33:11.049
Very nice.

01:33:21.806 --> 01:33:23.058
Ms. Schnabelstedt.

01:33:24.100 --> 01:33:25.602
Ms. Schnabelstedt.

01:33:27.228 --> 01:33:29.606
Damn it, help me.

01:33:30.231 --> 01:33:31.574
Go change please.

01:33:36.904 --> 01:33:38.451
Did you hurt yourself? - No.

01:33:39.323 --> 01:33:41.075
OK. You go change too.

01:33:57.299 --> 01:33:58.471
Hello?

01:33:59.927 --> 01:34:01.975
Where are you?
I said be here at midnight.

01:34:02.304 --> 01:34:04.978
Sorry, I overslept.
- Man, buy an alarm clock.

01:34:05.307 --> 01:34:07.730
I need to fill the hole
by the end of the week.

01:34:08.644 --> 01:34:10.567
Shit. I've got class in a minute.

01:34:10.938 --> 01:34:12.315
I have class.

01:34:12.648 --> 01:34:15.242
Your camouflage is getting
slightly schizo.

01:34:16.110 --> 01:34:17.487
I might have a job here.

01:34:18.070 --> 01:34:19.572
Zeki, come on. Forget it.

01:34:19.905 --> 01:34:22.909
Let's take your money and go away,
do some coke and party.

01:34:23.576 --> 01:34:26.079
That's not me anymore.
And I don't want to be that.

01:34:26.412 --> 01:34:29.336
Come help me tonight.
- What do I wear in a boiler room?

01:34:30.207 --> 01:34:32.505
If the bookworm finds out
I'm a bank robber,

01:34:32.835 --> 01:34:33.961
I'm screwed.

01:34:37.715 --> 01:34:38.841
I don't even own flats.

01:34:39.717 --> 01:34:41.014
What are you doing here?

01:34:43.470 --> 01:34:45.689
Zeki?
- Wait a sec. Listen to me.

01:34:46.015 --> 01:34:47.767
Unbelievable. Did you dig this?

01:34:48.976 --> 01:34:51.570
Don't get hysterical.
- Why did you dig a tunnel?

01:34:52.188 --> 01:34:54.737
I was looking for my cash,
buried under the gym.

01:34:55.065 --> 01:34:56.157
You're a criminal.

01:34:56.483 --> 01:34:58.656
Were you in prison? Did you escape?

01:34:58.986 --> 01:35:03.287
I did my 13 months. I don't even want
the money anymo... - 13 months!?

01:35:04.783 --> 01:35:06.706
Just wait please.

01:35:11.332 --> 01:35:12.333
Bro, she's fast.

01:35:19.340 --> 01:35:21.388
I like teaching.
- You're insane.

01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:24.679
Why? Our play almost won,
and we might win the science fair.

01:35:25.012 --> 01:35:26.264
Don't touch me.

01:35:27.014 --> 01:35:28.891
Is that why you pretended
to like me?

01:35:30.059 --> 01:35:31.231
Was I a good cover?

01:35:32.102 --> 01:35:34.480
Only at the beginning.
I wanted to tell you.

01:35:34.855 --> 01:35:36.152
But I was afrai...

01:35:37.191 --> 01:35:39.910
Now fuck off.
Or I swear I'll call the police.

01:36:26.031 --> 01:36:28.409
Your parents will pay forever.

01:36:29.159 --> 01:36:30.536
Ms. Schnabelstedt, a moment?

01:36:30.869 --> 01:36:33.668
About the gym, I'm assuming.
- No, we've cleared that up.

01:36:34.206 --> 01:36:37.005
We dug a tunnel
to look for Nazi treasure.

01:36:37.543 --> 01:36:38.920
Excuse me?

01:36:39.878 --> 01:36:41.471
We're really sorry.

01:36:41.797 --> 01:36:45.142
Mr. Miller caught us. He wanted to call
our parents. - Expensive!

01:36:45.467 --> 01:36:48.095
When is Mr. Miller coming back?
- He's not coming back.

01:36:48.429 --> 01:36:51.148
So the test is off?
- No, of course it's not.

01:36:51.473 --> 01:36:53.851
Hop hop, to class.
Chantal, Daniel, go!

01:36:54.435 --> 01:36:55.436
You take it.

01:37:01.358 --> 01:37:04.578
Please, Ms. Schnabelstedt,
tell him to come back.

01:37:05.029 --> 01:37:09.205
No. He lied. He used me.
And he put your future at risk.

01:37:09.533 --> 01:37:12.537
You'll all fail because of him.
What makes him so great?

01:37:14.455 --> 01:37:15.502
He understood us.

01:37:15.831 --> 01:37:17.879
Plus he is totally sweet.

01:37:20.294 --> 01:37:21.295
Chantal, really.

01:37:22.046 --> 01:37:24.094
This test is your last chance.

01:37:24.423 --> 01:37:26.175
OK, man. Don't get worked up.

01:37:27.885 --> 01:37:31.014
What are you doing?
- Our motivation pictures, man.

01:37:34.433 --> 01:37:35.730
What's it supposed to be.

01:37:36.060 --> 01:37:40.190
Yeah, the reason we want to improve.
Or people we want to make proud.

01:37:40.564 --> 01:37:43.238
Mr. Miller taught us to do it.
He has one too.

01:37:44.443 --> 01:37:45.695
A picture of a beer can?

01:37:47.112 --> 01:37:48.705
Upper right drawer.

01:37:58.832 --> 01:38:00.379
WHY?

01:38:01.668 --> 01:38:03.261
FOR

01:38:07.299 --> 01:38:08.300
Hello.

01:38:09.009 --> 01:38:11.307
This is for you.
It was in my locker.

01:38:11.637 --> 01:38:13.139
Please leave my classroom.

01:38:14.765 --> 01:38:17.143
I've known him for 15 years.
He's good stuff.

01:38:17.601 --> 01:38:19.228
Or he'd have hooked up with me.

01:38:25.192 --> 01:38:26.444
Don't you have class?

01:38:27.111 --> 01:38:28.158
Yes.

01:38:30.739 --> 01:38:32.616
Hi there.
- Hello.

01:38:39.331 --> 01:38:41.504
I've had the money for ages,
but I stayed,

01:38:41.834 --> 01:38:44.132
because of the little jerks
and because of you.

01:38:44.795 --> 01:38:46.672
I wanted to start over.
New job.

01:38:47.423 --> 01:38:50.802
The money is proof. Pay for the gym,
so the school doesn't go broke.

01:38:51.135 --> 01:38:52.637
Keep the rest for Laura.

01:38:53.095 --> 01:38:55.644
Someday she'll want to go abroad
or get new tits.

01:38:56.098 --> 01:39:00.023
There's no blood on the money.
So don't flip out. I'll manage.

01:39:00.436 --> 01:39:04.111
I'm not good enough for you anyway.
Don't let them fuck with you. Your Zeki.

01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:06.738
He'll do a break-in
if you desert him now.

01:39:07.568 --> 01:39:09.491
You made him want to change.

01:39:11.321 --> 01:39:12.322
Fuck.

01:39:12.656 --> 01:39:15.535
You said fuck. You have to put
1 euro in the fuck frog.

01:39:20.539 --> 01:39:22.212
I'd like to cheat now.

01:39:22.541 --> 01:39:25.841
No, we're not allowed.
- OK, OK. What's up with you guys?

01:39:26.170 --> 01:39:29.049
Fuck yourself, I'm not here.
- Shit, his mobile's off.

01:39:30.257 --> 01:39:31.634
I hope he's not screwing up.

01:39:34.470 --> 01:39:38.270
What is that? - I made it for you
in the burnout clinic.

01:39:39.933 --> 01:39:41.105
Is it dishwasher safe?

01:39:41.727 --> 01:39:44.480
You think it's shit?
- No, it's sweet. Great.

01:39:46.023 --> 01:39:47.320
When can you work again?

01:39:47.649 --> 01:39:49.447
Forget it. I'm retiring.

01:39:50.235 --> 01:39:53.284
I have certification
for 12 weeks of dolphin therapy.

01:39:53.614 --> 01:39:55.412
Ingrid, who will take your place?

01:39:55.741 --> 01:39:56.993
You've gone mad.

01:39:57.326 --> 01:39:58.498
Find another chump.

01:39:58.827 --> 01:40:01.376
And let's dispense
with a good-bye kiss.

01:40:03.624 --> 01:40:06.548
I loaded all the pornos
onto the FTP server.

01:40:07.294 --> 01:40:10.719
Sorted. By anal, oral, vaginal.
- Jerome!

01:40:11.215 --> 01:40:12.808
Can you track Mr. Miller's cell?

01:40:13.342 --> 01:40:16.346
Negative. But the robot's
still in his car. It has a SIM card.

01:40:19.306 --> 01:40:22.526
Ms. Schnabelstedt. As I recall
you were administering a test.

01:40:22.851 --> 01:40:24.945
It's an emergency.
You have to take over.

01:40:25.270 --> 01:40:27.443
And I can't discuss it right now.
Jerome!

01:40:33.904 --> 01:40:35.872
Class! - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:40:37.783 --> 01:40:38.784
Sile...

01:40:46.458 --> 01:40:47.505
Bro.

01:40:48.669 --> 01:40:50.012
Time for a withdrawal.

01:40:52.965 --> 01:40:54.137
Your piece.

01:40:59.096 --> 01:41:00.222
Will it work, Jerome?

01:41:05.894 --> 01:41:06.986
Zeki!

01:41:08.647 --> 01:41:10.991
Excuse me!
Hush Puppies. 2 minutes.

01:41:12.859 --> 01:41:16.784
OK, you had the money.
And you proved you're more than a felon.

01:41:17.114 --> 01:41:18.491
What the fuck is this?

01:41:18.824 --> 01:41:21.077
The gym is fucked up.
I can't come back anyway.

01:41:21.410 --> 01:41:23.253
The students covered.
They love you.

01:41:24.079 --> 01:41:25.422
And ...

01:41:26.206 --> 01:41:27.583
so do ...

01:41:29.459 --> 01:41:30.460
Zeki?

01:41:30.794 --> 01:41:31.966
Do something Jerome.

01:41:32.462 --> 01:41:33.679
I can try a satellite.

01:41:34.006 --> 01:41:37.101
But it takes 2 days.
And I'll have the CIA on my tail.

01:41:40.053 --> 01:41:41.680
HERO SECURITY
CASH TRANSPORT

01:41:42.180 --> 01:41:43.432
Put the mask on.

01:41:49.646 --> 01:41:50.943
Hello, Mr. Miller!

01:41:53.066 --> 01:41:55.910
Who's the little motherfucker?
- Shut up. Let me handle it.

01:41:57.571 --> 01:42:00.495
What're you doing here?
- We're shopping for tonight's punch.

01:42:00.824 --> 01:42:03.452
Can you buy us schnapps?
- You put alcohol in it?

01:42:03.785 --> 01:42:06.914
We want to get Ms. Gerster drunk
so she'll sing karaoke again.

01:42:07.664 --> 01:42:11.043
I can't buy alcohol for you.
Ms. Schnabelstedt would freak out.

01:42:11.376 --> 01:42:14.175
But it's the prom. Please, Mr. Miller
Just once.

01:42:14.546 --> 01:42:16.514
Do something forbidden just this once.

01:42:32.230 --> 01:42:33.777
Bro, what about money?

01:42:34.399 --> 01:42:37.278
What about THE money?
Study the articles, you fuckwit.

01:42:39.071 --> 01:42:42.621
Ms. Gerster said we'd get you next year.
Since you always get the losers.

01:42:43.075 --> 01:42:45.794
We'll see.
- Will you shoot us with paintballs too?

01:42:46.119 --> 01:42:48.372
Maybe, if you're bad.
- Great. Definitely!

01:42:48.997 --> 01:42:50.294
Hey! It's red.

01:43:15.941 --> 01:43:19.912
Zeki! I was so unfair. You were so great
with the kids. You really helped them.

01:43:20.237 --> 01:43:23.616
I got your message too late,
we'd started. I'm on the run.

01:43:24.449 --> 01:43:26.042
Oh god. it's all my fault.

01:43:26.368 --> 01:43:28.666
I have to go. Hide this.
Don't look inside.

01:43:29.538 --> 01:43:30.915
It's better you don't know.

01:43:31.832 --> 01:43:32.833
Zeki, don't leave.

01:43:33.166 --> 01:43:35.464
I like you so much.
- Me too.

01:43:35.919 --> 01:43:37.216
Promise you'll wait for me?

01:43:38.714 --> 01:43:40.887
How long do you have
to go underground?

01:43:41.883 --> 01:43:43.135
Four or five years.

01:43:43.927 --> 01:43:45.019
OK.

01:43:55.230 --> 01:43:57.153
DO YOU WANT TO GO OUT?
YES, NO, MAYBE.

01:44:01.987 --> 01:44:02.988
I knew you'd look.

01:44:05.615 --> 01:44:06.616
Motherfucker!

01:44:06.950 --> 01:44:08.793
But we don't say that in class, eh?

01:44:09.953 --> 01:44:11.079
Go get changed.

01:44:11.955 --> 01:44:13.423
Give me 5 minutes.

01:44:33.810 --> 01:44:35.687
Don't you think I'll ...

01:44:41.735 --> 01:44:42.861
... kiss you.

01:44:52.537 --> 01:44:54.460
I don't want to be
a criminal anymore.

01:44:56.124 --> 01:44:58.968
Because of you.
- I'm not going to discuss it.

01:44:59.294 --> 01:45:00.887
You can't teach anymore.

01:45:01.379 --> 01:45:02.881
You square.

01:45:03.465 --> 01:45:05.888
Why square? Why am I always the ...

01:45:10.847 --> 01:45:13.145
Mr. Miller. Upstairs.

01:45:13.558 --> 01:45:14.605
Fuck.

01:45:16.394 --> 01:45:17.862
You think she knows something?

01:45:18.730 --> 01:45:20.949
Please explain
what you did to that class?

01:45:21.316 --> 01:45:24.286
It's all my fault ...
I didn't stick to the syllabus.

01:45:24.611 --> 01:45:27.205
Fuck the syllabus.
I didn't say that officially.

01:45:27.906 --> 01:45:30.079
I've done this job for 25 years

01:45:30.408 --> 01:45:33.537
and I have never cried
correcting a German test.

01:45:33.870 --> 01:45:36.293
Now, look.
Nobody got less than "satisfactory".

01:45:36.832 --> 01:45:40.632
Mr. Miller, if even 2/3 of 10b
moves to upper school,

01:45:40.961 --> 01:45:43.430
we'll make top 10 in city rankings.

01:45:43.964 --> 01:45:46.092
I want a cafeteria fund, a new xerox,

01:45:46.424 --> 01:45:48.051
and I want smartboards.

01:45:48.844 --> 01:45:50.642
No more chalk fingers!

01:45:50.971 --> 01:45:52.598
You'll finish out the school year.

01:45:56.685 --> 01:45:59.780
But I'm not actually a teacher.
I didn't go to college,

01:46:02.399 --> 01:46:04.276
and I didn't finish high school.

01:46:08.864 --> 01:46:12.164
Maybe you could go to night school.
- Precisely.

01:46:13.869 --> 01:46:15.963
Then we wait 5 years
until he's done,

01:46:16.371 --> 01:46:18.999
until some enviro-idiot takes away
my principal job

01:46:19.332 --> 01:46:22.711
and makes this a comprehensive
junior high. No, absolutely not.

01:46:25.380 --> 01:46:26.723
Meaning?

01:46:28.341 --> 01:46:30.435
Ms. Schnabelstedt,
you're a smarty-pants.

01:46:31.136 --> 01:46:32.558
What's his GPA?

01:46:38.268 --> 01:46:39.645
Uh, a 1.0?

01:47:02.834 --> 01:47:04.836
Look here, it came out 2.9.

01:47:05.170 --> 01:47:07.593
Congratulations
on your 2006 diploma, Mr. Miller.

01:47:10.300 --> 01:47:12.018
Advanced placement art and sports.

01:47:12.552 --> 01:47:14.145
Sounds realistic.
- Yes.

01:47:14.512 --> 01:47:17.686
When the year's over, you'll study.
Until then, you're a teacher.

01:47:18.016 --> 01:47:20.815
You get 2000 a month.
Lying to me cost you 200.

01:47:21.436 --> 01:47:22.904
Isn't this illegal?

01:47:23.188 --> 01:47:24.360
Right.

01:47:24.689 --> 01:47:26.566
Know what else is illegal?

01:47:26.900 --> 01:47:28.197
Tonight is prom

01:47:28.526 --> 01:47:30.119
and I'm still not drunk enough

01:47:30.445 --> 01:47:34.120
to pick up a certain single father.

01:47:34.449 --> 01:47:37.043
But Ms. Gerster ...
- Ms. Schnabelstedt, listen up.

01:47:38.370 --> 01:47:40.919
They make fools
of teachers every day.

01:47:41.414 --> 01:47:43.542
From time to time,
we need to strike back.

01:47:44.459 --> 01:47:46.837
See you. Assapissimo. Drunk.

01:47:47.253 --> 01:47:48.254
At the bar.

01:47:48.588 --> 01:47:51.432
It's not funny.
Other people go to college for that.

01:47:51.800 --> 01:47:53.143
I have a natural talent.

01:47:53.969 --> 01:47:56.688
Tomorrow the syllabus.
Before you do anything in class.

01:47:57.013 --> 01:47:58.060
Hey, Schnabelstedt.

01:47:59.057 --> 01:48:02.903
Think about it. Starting now, you can
torture me, make me read books

01:48:03.228 --> 01:48:06.402
and fuck me in free periods,
until civil service status do us part.

01:48:07.732 --> 01:48:09.029
OK.

01:48:14.739 --> 01:48:15.991
Hey, Ms. Schnabelstedt.

01:48:16.616 --> 01:48:18.914
Is there alcohol in the punch?

01:48:19.244 --> 01:48:20.370
Elisabeth!

01:48:20.829 --> 01:48:22.547
Just relax for once!

01:50:24.744 --> 01:50:26.963
Don't I get a kiss ...

01:50:27.288 --> 01:50:29.541
Welcome to our new ...

01:50:30.166 --> 01:50:32.043
firefighter,

01:50:32.377 --> 01:50:34.846
Mr. Miller ... sorry.

01:50:39.926 --> 01:50:41.769
Peter Parker, go get a TV.

01:50:44.264 --> 01:50:47.814
... there's a DVD ready ...

01:50:48.184 --> 01:50:49.561
sorry.

01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:51.772
And no children's films.

01:51:01.781 --> 01:51:03.408
So who wants to be a drug dealer?

01:51:08.079 --> 01:51:09.205
Forgotten.

01:51:10.081 --> 01:51:11.207
Excuse me.

01:51:15.545 --> 01:51:16.637
Who laughed?

01:51:18.464 --> 01:51:20.512
Chantal Ackerman?
- Here!

01:51:39.694 --> 01:51:42.914
School inspectors could show up
at any time and give out demerits.

01:51:43.448 --> 01:51:44.665
You may go undress.

01:51:51.080 --> 01:51:52.297
Wait, wait.

01:51:53.499 --> 01:51:57.094
Not yet. Not yet. Go back.
- Still rolling.

01:51:59.130 --> 01:52:01.599
Chantal? Cry quietly.

01:52:05.845 --> 01:52:08.439
They were making name tags
and smeared.

01:52:10.308 --> 01:52:12.436
That was you.
- No. No.

01:52:14.103 --> 01:52:16.231
I didn't show it.
- Ask me again?

01:52:16.940 --> 01:52:17.987
What's the question?

01:52:29.202 --> 01:52:30.374
Hello.

01:52:37.168 --> 01:52:39.796
Laura, do you have to wear
dad's old shirts?

01:52:43.049 --> 01:52:44.266
Who's dad, man?

01:52:45.635 --> 01:52:48.309
I feel like a technical ...

01:52:55.436 --> 01:52:58.565
Don't be so funny. - The things
you find funny are weird.

01:53:01.025 --> 01:53:03.153
Reading for the ...
shooting schedule.

01:53:05.488 --> 01:53:08.958
Don't jump from the pool ...
from the edge ...

01:53:12.787 --> 01:53:13.834
Unconventional ...

01:53:15.498 --> 01:53:17.045
I'm really worried ...

01:53:21.045 --> 01:53:22.171
What?

01:53:23.381 --> 01:53:24.382
Keep going.

01:53:24.716 --> 01:53:26.218
Now put the dick in your mouth.

01:53:29.262 --> 01:53:32.311
Can't believe I say that.
- He's breaking up. - Sorry.

01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:33.732
Really.

01:53:35.351 --> 01:53:37.854
Caro doesn't think it's funny.
- 15, the best age.

01:53:39.439 --> 01:53:40.565
It's a penis.

01:53:41.357 --> 01:53:42.449
You'll never ...

01:53:44.736 --> 01:53:46.033
Put the dick in your mouth.

01:53:48.156 --> 01:53:49.908
Could we blow it again?

01:53:54.078 --> 01:53:56.627
As if!
- The guy's a killer.

01:53:57.165 --> 01:53:58.462
Elyas ...

01:53:59.083 --> 01:54:00.881
Underwear?
- Check yourself.

01:54:02.003 --> 01:54:03.425
Tighty whities?

01:54:04.630 --> 01:54:05.927
He stinks.

01:54:08.301 --> 01:54:09.553
Ugh. What now?

01:54:10.887 --> 01:54:13.310
I say, come down, let's chill it.

01:54:14.057 --> 01:54:16.401
Chill IT?
- Yeah, CHILL it.

01:54:20.980 --> 01:54:24.200
Romeo, you frigging junkie.
- Sorry.

01:54:27.403 --> 01:54:28.871
Cut, thank you.

01:54:30.198 --> 01:54:31.370
Who's that?

01:54:36.204 --> 01:54:38.002
Sorry.

01:54:40.958 --> 01:54:42.084
Sorry.

01:54:42.877 --> 01:54:44.550
Is Ronny here? He's asleep.

01:54:44.879 --> 01:54:46.005
He's STILL drunk.

01:54:46.631 --> 01:54:48.099
Say, he's still DRUNK.

01:54:48.508 --> 01:54:49.634
He's STILL drunk.

01:54:50.134 --> 01:54:52.353
Say he's still DRUNK, not STILL drunk.

01:54:53.012 --> 01:54:54.013
Is Ronny ...

01:54:54.680 --> 01:54:57.775
ls Ronny here?
- He's asleep. He's STILL DRUNK.

01:55:01.312 --> 01:55:02.279
Is Ronny here?

01:55:03.481 --> 01:55:05.074
He's asleep. He's STILL drunk.

01:55:07.568 --> 01:55:09.036
New script page.

01:55:10.655 --> 01:55:11.998
Do you need the question.

01:55:12.990 --> 01:55:15.743
No, I don't need it.
He's sleeping. He's still drunk.

01:55:17.370 --> 01:55:18.587
Good. OK.

01:55:23.042 --> 01:55:24.259
Had I it written ...

01:55:25.294 --> 01:55:27.888
Had I it written, I would tear ...

01:55:31.217 --> 01:55:33.185
A little complicated. Again?

01:55:33.761 --> 01:55:34.762
Ingrid ...

01:55:39.642 --> 01:55:41.189
Fuck me.

01:55:45.940 --> 01:55:47.283
I can hear you.

01:55:49.652 --> 01:55:51.825
Ingrid, I'm ...

01:55:55.950 --> 01:55:57.952
Here, your piece.
- You forgot to spritz.

01:55:58.286 --> 01:55:59.833
From the top.

01:56:00.538 --> 01:56:01.915
I forgot to spritz.

01:56:02.290 --> 01:56:03.291
Mr. Miller, if ...

01:56:03.833 --> 01:56:05.085
... if even 10 ...

01:56:06.127 --> 01:56:08.050
if even ... how many?

01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:10.006
More, more.

01:56:12.758 --> 01:56:13.759
More, more.

01:56:15.678 --> 01:56:18.557
That's all. Take a sip.

01:56:19.474 --> 01:56:20.566
OK, now.

01:56:22.810 --> 01:56:23.811
More, more.

01:56:27.899 --> 01:56:30.277
Sorry.
- Let's do it.

01:56:31.152 --> 01:56:32.153
More, more.

01:56:33.321 --> 01:56:35.870
Shit. OK, now. Really. It's not ...

01:56:36.741 --> 01:56:38.414
Really.
- It's not funny.

01:56:43.789 --> 01:56:46.167
Stop it. Don't look at me.

01:56:47.043 --> 01:56:48.716
My sister and I are orphans.

01:56:57.470 --> 01:57:00.849
