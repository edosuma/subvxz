WEBVTT

00:01.359 --> 00:03.959
Anyone watching,
thinking we know fuck all

00:03.960 --> 00:05.999
about knowing fuck all about owt,

00:06.000 --> 00:08.359
needs to watch their back.

00:08.360 --> 00:11.519
So, you've had your Labour
reclassifying skunk,

00:11.520 --> 00:13.239
sending prices sky-high,

00:13.240 --> 00:17.239
literally, literally, taking
the grass from its own roots.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.959
Now you've got your Con-Dem nation,

00:19.960 --> 00:23.359
Liberals noshing Tories
like altar boys picking dimps up.

00:23.360 --> 00:27.359
Have we had a national
fucking stroke or what?

00:28.000 --> 00:31.159
Is revolution a word,
or was it never?

00:31.160 --> 00:33.599
Anybody watching needs to know,

00:33.600 --> 00:37.039
we cope better than average
with irony in Chatsworth.

00:37.040 --> 00:39.879
Well, for fuck's sake,
we live in Manchester

00:39.880 --> 00:43.119
and they charge us for water.

00:43.120 --> 00:47.119
I wandered lonely as a clown,
necking mushrooms rarely found.

00:47.920 --> 00:51.639
This green and pleasant land
in ancient times...

00:51.640 --> 00:54.239
Yak, yak, yak, yak,
yak, yak, yak, yak, yak!

00:54.240 --> 00:57.519
It's not theirs any more.

00:57.520 --> 01:01.039
This is our England now.

01:01.040 --> 01:05.039
Party!

01:07.720 --> 01:10.959
Can someone please
explain the criteria for a lie

01:10.960 --> 01:12.839
to be a little white lie?

01:12.840 --> 01:15.719
Whose standard
are we measuring this by?

01:15.720 --> 01:19.719
Why don't we have labels
for other sizes of lies?

01:19.800 --> 01:23.799
Lies that are off-white,
or darkening shades of grey,

01:24.000 --> 01:27.999
until in the end they turn to big
dirty pitch-black abominations?

01:32.200 --> 01:34.639
Uh-oh!
Uh-oh!

01:34.640 --> 01:37.319
Uh-oh. A big rub.

01:38.560 --> 01:41.639
Wow!

01:43.840 --> 01:47.839
It pains me to admit it, but I never
thought she'd be this good.

01:52.040 --> 01:56.039
Er... need to change
the barrel, yeah?

01:56.920 --> 02:00.919
What for?

02:08.759 --> 02:11.439
Jamie!

02:13.000 --> 02:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:36.240 --> 02:39.399
Oh, shit.
Are you taking the piss?

02:39.400 --> 02:42.119
Mam! Mam, leave it, leave it.

02:57.040 --> 03:00.439
Paddy?!

03:01.520 --> 03:02.559
Get in!

03:08.600 --> 03:10.319
He just couldn't go quietly,
could he?

03:10.320 --> 03:13.919
Lady Diana had less people
lining the streets.

03:13.920 --> 03:15.359
God rest her soul.

03:15.360 --> 03:18.679
When did he die?

03:18.680 --> 03:20.759
Right?
What are you doing?

03:20.760 --> 03:24.759
Whoo!

03:26.520 --> 03:29.439
I'm surprised
they weren't wearing balaclavas.

03:30.400 --> 03:33.599
Ooh, that's a pretty one.

03:33.600 --> 03:35.679
It's fucking lovely, Mimi!

03:35.680 --> 03:38.239
All right, mate? How's it going?

03:38.240 --> 03:39.559
Hiya.

03:39.560 --> 03:41.919
All right?

03:41.920 --> 03:43.839
How's it going, man?

03:43.840 --> 03:46.519
Hey, I thought the IRA
gave all their guns to the filth.

03:46.520 --> 03:48.999
Yeah, well,
plenty slipped through the net.

03:54.040 --> 03:56.359
Shane, cheers, mate.
Good stuff.

03:56.360 --> 03:59.519
See you, love, take care.

03:59.520 --> 04:02.919
Nice weapon. Ha-ha-ha.

04:02.920 --> 04:04.919
Talk about drawing attention, though.

04:04.920 --> 04:08.919
He's not stupid.
Now the police think he's dead,
he can start all over.

04:09.120 --> 04:11.119
So, where is he?
Got off to Thailand, didn't he?

04:12.880 --> 04:15.279
He'll be sipping cocktails
on a beach somewhere in Koh Samui.

04:15.280 --> 04:18.358
Or hanging out with some underage
brass in Patpingpong.

04:18.360 --> 04:20.798
Yeah!
Ah, fuck this.

04:20.800 --> 04:23.719
Hiya, Mimi.
Hiya.

04:23.720 --> 04:25.839
Fill your boots, lads.

04:25.840 --> 04:29.559
'A Moss Side man has been
arrested on suspicion of arson.

04:29.560 --> 04:32.639
'The arrest follows
a three-month-long investigation

04:32.640 --> 04:36.039
'of a suspected firebomb attack
on a house in...'

04:36.040 --> 04:39.439
I need pushing to Chesney's.
Well, why can't he take you?

04:39.440 --> 04:43.439
He's got to further his education
so he ends up nothing like you.

04:46.280 --> 04:50.279
Oh!

04:51.440 --> 04:54.519
Oh! Spare the fucking rod, Patty.

04:54.520 --> 04:57.799
This is the 21st century.
You can't buy a flagon of mead
in the Jockey, you know.

04:57.800 --> 05:00.839
And live rent-free as well?
Well, helping out covers that.

05:00.840 --> 05:03.799
Tinned food and chip shops?
Tight bitch.

05:03.800 --> 05:07.799
How many fucking brain cells
is that gonna help me batter?

05:07.840 --> 05:10.719
Take a look around, Frank.

05:10.720 --> 05:12.959
All those child benefits, long gone.

05:12.960 --> 05:14.559
Carl looks after me.

05:14.560 --> 05:18.039
Occasionally. It's my money
that keeps you going.

05:18.040 --> 05:21.719
Plus, I couldn't trust you
with any more than a tenner.

05:21.720 --> 05:24.359
It was a one-off.

05:24.360 --> 05:27.039
You would think I'd risk bankrolling

05:27.040 --> 05:30.519
such disgusting behaviour
at Lillian's again?

05:30.520 --> 05:34.519
It's a proven timeless cure
for lovesickness.

05:34.560 --> 05:38.559
Even if you can't get it up?

05:41.640 --> 05:45.479
You should never have driven Libby
away. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:45.480 --> 05:49.479
If you'd kept it in your pants,
she'd still be here.

05:50.800 --> 05:53.959
'We want you to ring in
and tell us your ideas...'

05:53.960 --> 05:56.759
Cigs, please, Ches.
And some green papers.

05:56.760 --> 06:00.199
Hiya!

06:00.200 --> 06:02.639
Chesney!

06:02.640 --> 06:05.599
How long have you been there?
You need to speak up, love.

06:05.600 --> 06:08.439
I'll have you for discrimination.

06:08.440 --> 06:10.799
Doubt it.

06:10.800 --> 06:14.799
Keep your pork faggots!

06:15.320 --> 06:18.279
Hey, little man.
Procession was a bit OTT,
wasn't it?

06:18.280 --> 06:21.519
You just practise looking sad.
Like the tears of a clown.

06:21.520 --> 06:24.159
How's business?
Demand's definitely there.

06:24.160 --> 06:27.119
I could do four parties tomorrow
if I had the staff.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.599
Staff?

06:28.600 --> 06:31.639
Shit. I have. I've double-booked.

06:31.640 --> 06:33.039
Relying on other people
can be hard work.

06:33.040 --> 06:34.999
I thought you were supporting me.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.719
You know I am. So, then,
why do you keep avoiding me?

06:37.720 --> 06:41.039
I love what you're doing.

06:41.040 --> 06:43.879
Lend us 500 quid, then.
It's cheap for a reason, Karen.

06:43.880 --> 06:47.879
No, no, it's not cheap
when you see what it can do.

06:51.680 --> 06:55.679
You look after me
and I might show you what I can do.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.679
What's up with you?
Not still missing Libby, are you?

07:02.680 --> 07:06.679
Oh, fuck me! Hello!
Vernon Francis doesn't lose any kip

07:06.800 --> 07:10.079
cos the latest split-arse
can't deal with the heat.

07:10.080 --> 07:13.359
Everyone can see right through you!

07:13.360 --> 07:15.599
Tell me, do I look bothered?

07:15.600 --> 07:19.599
Don't feel sorry for him.
You all saw how he treated her.

07:21.480 --> 07:25.239
25% off any of the girls
except Marcie and Mandy.

07:25.240 --> 07:28.919
They've just been vagazzled.
Swarovski.

07:28.920 --> 07:30.399
Oh!

07:30.400 --> 07:33.519
Do I look like some low-life punter
with zero self-respect?

07:33.520 --> 07:36.559
No offence, of course.

07:36.560 --> 07:40.559
Suit yourself.
Ah!

07:42.760 --> 07:46.759
Oh! This bloody pub!

07:47.320 --> 07:49.319
She'll be perfect.

07:49.320 --> 07:51.239
I just need two more now.

07:51.240 --> 07:55.239
You've got no chance.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.839
Where there's a will...

07:57.840 --> 08:01.479
I'm sick of it! How am I supposed
to get in and out on my own?

08:01.480 --> 08:03.519
Now what are you whinging on about?

08:03.520 --> 08:06.319
Your toilets.
You couldn't swing a cat in there.

08:06.320 --> 08:10.319
Oh, yack, yack, yack.
Buy a drink or shut the fuck up.

08:10.520 --> 08:13.199
If they're too small
I'll have you for discrimination.

08:13.200 --> 08:17.199
Whoa! Fucking...
Dr Quinn, Medicine Woman.

08:17.280 --> 08:19.959
Lower than a rattlesnake's clout.

08:19.960 --> 08:21.799
Oh.
Agreed!

08:21.800 --> 08:24.239
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

08:24.240 --> 08:25.479
There's nothing worse.

08:25.480 --> 08:28.599
Grasses make me sick.
I haven't done anything!

08:28.600 --> 08:32.239
And there's nothing for you to do
if you're already barred.

08:32.240 --> 08:34.078
Oh!

08:34.080 --> 08:36.359
Back at the gaff, Strangelove!

08:38.600 --> 08:41.999
I know they weren't together,
but Mimi has just lost her husband.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.438
That Scouse bitch
shouldn't speak to me like that.

08:43.440 --> 08:44.959
They're gangsters!

08:44.960 --> 08:47.639
More plastic than
a Tupperware party.

08:47.640 --> 08:49.839
I remember when
Manchester had real villains.

08:49.840 --> 08:53.079
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Old-school QSG?

08:53.080 --> 08:56.599
Those old fuckers wouldn't last
ten minutes on the streets today.

08:56.600 --> 09:00.239
You don't mess with the Maguires.
Half-breed tinkers? Don't scare me.

09:00.240 --> 09:03.359
Here. Read that bit.

09:03.360 --> 09:05.919
"2.2 by 1.8..."

09:05.920 --> 09:07.279
Mm-hm.
Er...

09:07.280 --> 09:09.519
"With a minimum turning circle
of 1.5 metres."

09:09.520 --> 09:13.519
Right, come on.

09:15.320 --> 09:17.959
That's it there.
See?

09:17.960 --> 09:21.959
Knew it! Miles out.
Pass me the phone.

09:22.520 --> 09:26.519
It's about time somebody stood up
to those bullies.

09:30.080 --> 09:34.079
Sorry for your loss.

09:40.920 --> 09:44.919
That's every police station
in South Manchester.

09:46.320 --> 09:50.319
Something wrong with your legs?
What am I supposed to put the ale in?

09:57.360 --> 09:59.719
Do us a favour, will you?
Collect some glasses.

09:59.720 --> 10:03.719
I've done a lot worse
for a lot less.

10:06.640 --> 10:10.639
I'm gonna go lie down
a minute, yeah?

10:17.960 --> 10:19.839
Why can't you juggle like that?

10:19.840 --> 10:23.839
Because that knobhead
was born a clown.

10:26.840 --> 10:28.839
Karma police.

10:28.840 --> 10:32.279
Paddy Maguire, bang to rights.

10:32.280 --> 10:36.159
Hey, what's the odds
on old nick-nack Paddy-whack

10:36.160 --> 10:39.119
drifting off all peaceful
with a smile on his napper?

10:39.120 --> 10:41.279
Fucking no chance.

10:41.280 --> 10:43.439
Chuckie ar la.

10:43.440 --> 10:47.439
Bet half of him's not even in there,
know what I mean? Vroom!

10:50.760 --> 10:51.919
Think he is chopped up?

10:51.920 --> 10:53.679
What happened
to you chatting me up?

10:53.680 --> 10:55.079
What's the point
if you won't let me do anything?

10:55.080 --> 10:58.879
Gaz Sharpe gave me this just
to watch me bend over from behind.

10:58.880 --> 11:00.279
I only want a kiss.

11:00.280 --> 11:03.519
A kiss is actual contact. Intimate.

11:03.520 --> 11:06.479
Even prostitutes don't do that.

11:06.480 --> 11:10.479
I'll have to work out
what it's worth.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.279
What do we want?
Toilets!

11:16.280 --> 11:17.839
When do we want them?
Now!

11:17.840 --> 11:18.839
What do we want?

11:18.840 --> 11:20.239
What the...?

11:20.240 --> 11:21.639
When do we want them?
Now!

11:21.640 --> 11:23.679
What do we want?
Toilets!

11:23.680 --> 11:25.879
When do we want them?
You're having a laugh.

11:25.880 --> 11:27.719
What do we want?
Toilets!

11:27.720 --> 11:29.119
When do we want them?
Now!

11:29.120 --> 11:31.119
What do we want?
Toilets!

11:31.120 --> 11:34.559
When do we want them?
Get the fuck away from my pub!

11:34.560 --> 11:36.599
They're disabled!

11:36.600 --> 11:38.679
So, they should know better!

11:38.680 --> 11:42.679
You stupid bitch!
This is a peaceful demonstration!

11:43.600 --> 11:45.479
Someone call the police!

11:45.480 --> 11:47.879
Jamie!

11:47.880 --> 11:51.239
Get away from me, you lunatic!

11:51.240 --> 11:53.639
You'll get nicked
for being on the premises!

11:53.640 --> 11:57.119
Leave her alone!
Jamie!

11:57.120 --> 11:59.079
Jamie, do something!

11:59.080 --> 12:02.199
Mam!

12:02.200 --> 12:04.999
Mam!

12:05.000 --> 12:07.679
We don't need any trouble
with that coffin around.

12:07.680 --> 12:10.319
We'll do it.
Someone sees sense.

12:10.320 --> 12:12.959
You'll change both toilets?
Men's and women's.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.439
And a ramp?

12:17.480 --> 12:19.839
And am I still barred?

12:19.840 --> 12:21.039
No.

12:22.640 --> 12:25.719
It's the right thing to do.

12:28.040 --> 12:31.959
Jamie! Jamie!

12:33.480 --> 12:36.319
Jamie?

12:36.320 --> 12:38.199
Jamie!

12:40.720 --> 12:44.479
Jay!

12:44.480 --> 12:46.559
Wonder how he really died.

12:46.560 --> 12:48.719
Probably had a heart attack.

12:48.720 --> 12:52.719
Bit young. My cousin's
got one of these.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.959
You don't break
into gangsters' houses.

12:55.960 --> 12:58.599
I think I just worked out
what a kiss might be worth.

12:58.600 --> 13:02.599
A picture of Paddy on your phone.

13:13.720 --> 13:16.319
Letitia!

13:16.320 --> 13:20.319
Wait!

13:44.120 --> 13:45.319
What happened?

13:45.320 --> 13:48.519
You tell me. You fainted.

13:48.520 --> 13:50.279
Oh.

13:50.280 --> 13:52.159
Jamie?

13:56.640 --> 13:59.999
Ah, isn't he funny, Jamie?

14:01.440 --> 14:02.679
Ha-ha-ha!

14:11.080 --> 14:11.799
Oh.

14:11.800 --> 14:13.039
They've sent me under ever since.

14:13.040 --> 14:16.359
And I thought you were
a big, hard, fearless gangster.

14:16.360 --> 14:17.839
This can't get out, Karen.

14:17.840 --> 14:18.599
Course not.

14:18.600 --> 14:21.319
I'm serious. Any sign of weakness
and people pounce.

14:21.320 --> 14:23.639
Tony Soprano went to a shrink.

14:23.640 --> 14:24.519
Karen.

14:24.520 --> 14:28.519
OK. I get it.

14:40.160 --> 14:41.679
Surprise!

14:41.680 --> 14:42.559
Karen! Don't!

14:42.560 --> 14:44.799
Shh. OK. OK.

14:44.800 --> 14:45.719
It'll be OK.

14:45.720 --> 14:47.439
Please!

14:47.440 --> 14:51.439
I promise. It'll be all right.
See?

14:52.680 --> 14:55.119
Just let it go.

14:55.120 --> 14:56.959
Karen, please, I'm fucking
begging you!

14:56.960 --> 15:00.119
Shh. This'll work. Don't be scared.

15:00.120 --> 15:01.879
Come on.

15:01.880 --> 15:04.679
No!

15:04.680 --> 15:08.679
OK.

15:10.800 --> 15:12.399
Are you some kind of pervert?

15:12.400 --> 15:13.559
You owe me.

15:13.560 --> 15:15.679
You didn't even get a photo.

15:15.680 --> 15:19.679
What if I got something better?

15:20.160 --> 15:21.039
Are you stupid?

15:21.040 --> 15:22.599
We could sell it.

15:22.600 --> 15:26.599
We? Leave it out! What if it's...

15:27.720 --> 15:29.719
The trigger's a bit...

15:30.680 --> 15:34.679
What are you doing?
Get away from here.

15:35.960 --> 15:39.959
Outside. Just now. Two shots.

15:40.600 --> 15:44.599
Quickly!

15:50.280 --> 15:54.279
Should never have left Longsight.
You all right?

15:54.520 --> 15:58.519
That's all that matters.

16:07.880 --> 16:10.639
How would I know if anyone
was out to get us?

16:10.640 --> 16:14.639
Could be kids fucking about.
Why would we have enemies?

16:14.960 --> 16:17.559
Just part of the investigation,
Mrs Maguire.

16:17.560 --> 16:21.559
I'd like to know which grass
reported this bullshit, though.

16:27.960 --> 16:30.679
These things dig right into my tits.

16:30.680 --> 16:33.559
Fucking Gunchester.
Give me the Dingle any day.

16:33.560 --> 16:35.479
That was every wrong 'un in town

16:35.480 --> 16:38.639
and nobody's owning up to firing
a gun. Our enemies are lying low.

16:38.640 --> 16:41.239
Right.

16:41.240 --> 16:42.359
Well, go on.

16:42.360 --> 16:42.839
The police.

16:42.840 --> 16:45.199
Ah, now they really are
taking the piss.

16:45.200 --> 16:48.639
Not commiserating for Paddy.
Mental Macca got killed last night.

16:48.640 --> 16:51.039
They haven't got a body, though.

16:51.040 --> 16:54.679
No. But half of his brain's
left splattered on a wall.

16:54.680 --> 16:58.679
How do you know anyway?

17:07.800 --> 17:10.878
He wouldn't take no for an answer.
We had no choice.

17:10.880 --> 17:13.279
Is nothing sacred?

17:13.280 --> 17:14.919
It's an empty coffin!

17:14.920 --> 17:16.638
With your father's name on it!

17:16.640 --> 17:20.398
It was a lot less messy
than chopping Macca up.

17:20.400 --> 17:24.398
The bizzies just said that
whoever killed Mental Macca
is shooting at us.

17:25.280 --> 17:26.358
Why would they say that?

17:26.359 --> 17:29.799
The bullet casings they found
are from the same gun.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.839
Bollocks. They can't be.

17:31.840 --> 17:34.239
Maybe it's their idea of a joke.

17:34.240 --> 17:36.879
Oh, funny. Very fucking funny.

17:36.880 --> 17:40.879
Yeah. Do you want to rearrange?

17:41.720 --> 17:43.199
OK. Bye.

17:43.200 --> 17:45.079
What's up?

17:45.080 --> 17:46.999
Another cancellation.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.559
What's wrong with you?

17:48.560 --> 17:52.559
Nothing.
I just need to check something.

17:57.640 --> 18:01.639
Oh, aye? What have you done
with our daughter?

18:03.200 --> 18:04.399
I paid her off.

18:04.400 --> 18:05.439
You'll teach her bad habits.

18:05.440 --> 18:08.559
She'll need plenty,
if she's to get what she wants.

18:10.200 --> 18:11.599
I know what you want.

18:11.600 --> 18:13.199
Oh!

18:20.520 --> 18:24.519
And the warriors climbed off
the unicorns, and dived into
the crystal pool.

18:27.160 --> 18:30.039
Which made their shorts
go all see-through.

18:30.040 --> 18:33.839
And all the children
lived happily ever after.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.839
What's Mental Macca doing
in there?

18:46.880 --> 18:48.999
Ah, whoa! What have I done?

18:49.000 --> 18:49.639
Where is it?

18:49.640 --> 18:50.479
What?

18:50.480 --> 18:51.719
The gun.

18:51.720 --> 18:53.279
I thought we'd sold them all.

18:53.280 --> 18:55.319
The one with my prints on it.

18:55.320 --> 18:56.759
Ahh!

19:01.720 --> 19:02.839
That Afro was the only reason
you went out with me.

19:02.840 --> 19:04.799
Is that what you reckon?

19:04.800 --> 19:07.959
My comb at an angle.
Tacchini tracksuit.

19:07.960 --> 19:09.919
Break-dancing at West Wythy
with Jason Orange.

19:09.920 --> 19:12.479
I sure picked the right one then.

19:12.480 --> 19:14.479
I could spin on my head
better than him.

19:14.480 --> 19:17.359
Only cos you had more padding.

19:17.360 --> 19:18.399
Round two upstairs?

19:18.400 --> 19:21.399
Mm.

19:21.400 --> 19:23.519
I'll be waiting.

19:58.480 --> 20:02.479
Bye!

20:13.800 --> 20:17.799
I'm delighted the landlord
has seen fit to cater to our needs.

20:19.520 --> 20:23.279
It's about time more people stood up
for what they know to be right.

20:23.280 --> 20:25.439
Three cheers for Patty! Hip-hip!

20:25.440 --> 20:28.039
At least they're spending.

20:28.040 --> 20:32.039
We'll take to the road
and show no mercy for any business

20:32.240 --> 20:35.599
that fails to meet
the basic levels of support

20:35.600 --> 20:39.599
needed by everyone in this
community.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.759
How was it?

20:46.760 --> 20:49.879
Not bad. Come on, over here.

20:49.880 --> 20:52.799
Always knew you were a clown, Micky!

20:52.800 --> 20:56.799
So, who got the best tips?

20:57.440 --> 20:59.719
What happened?

20:59.720 --> 21:03.719
Hoo-hoo!

21:11.200 --> 21:14.319
Who wants to see some magic,
kids? Wanna play?

21:14.320 --> 21:17.239
Ooh. Ha.

21:17.240 --> 21:20.199
Ooh. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Oh!

21:20.200 --> 21:22.279
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Oh!

21:22.280 --> 21:24.359
So, no-one got paid?

21:24.360 --> 21:28.039
I had to pay them. Compo.
But I'll cover it.

21:28.040 --> 21:31.159
Do you know how much this gear costs?

21:31.160 --> 21:32.759
We'll do better next time.

21:32.760 --> 21:34.839
Please, Karen. I love my job.

21:34.840 --> 21:38.839
Me too.

21:38.920 --> 21:42.439
Must be true what they say.
Old Dr Time can heal all wounds.

21:42.440 --> 21:46.439
With the help of a crushed-up Viagra
and a gram of Charlie.

21:49.800 --> 21:51.799
Jamie, get Patty
whatever she wants.

21:51.800 --> 21:55.799
A single malt.

21:55.800 --> 21:57.719
Pint, Mimi.

21:57.720 --> 22:01.519
Your fetid little maggot
back in working order, then?

22:01.520 --> 22:02.519
Y'on about?

22:02.520 --> 22:04.919
Libby's better off
away from such filth.

22:04.920 --> 22:08.399
Lest we forget, your own daughter
fucked off on you as well.

22:08.400 --> 22:12.399
Because you filled her head full
of romance and turned out to be
a gobshite.

22:13.040 --> 22:17.039
Ah. And has she been in touch
with her dear old mum to tell her
how she is?

22:17.240 --> 22:19.679
Treat her to a coffee?

22:19.680 --> 22:23.679
Let her know
where the fuck she's even gone?

22:30.960 --> 22:34.959
Son?

22:42.120 --> 22:43.159
Where is he?

22:43.160 --> 22:44.759
Aidan!

22:44.760 --> 22:47.839
I'm on the radio in a second.

22:47.840 --> 22:49.079
That's nice.

22:49.080 --> 22:52.759
Are you listening to your favourite
great auntie on the wireless?

22:52.760 --> 22:56.759
You're my only great auntie.
Record it for us.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.439
Did you get it back?

22:58.440 --> 23:01.919
It wasn't there
and they're not saying anything.

23:01.920 --> 23:04.279
You two getting it on yet?

23:04.280 --> 23:06.199
I'm on the radio in a minute, Carl.

23:06.200 --> 23:09.159
Yeah, nice one. I need a few Z's.
Had another late one.

23:09.160 --> 23:12.959
'..mathematics and science
in older children.

23:12.960 --> 23:15.679
'The Government's latest drive
to raise standards...'

23:15.680 --> 23:17.879
Aidan! It...

23:17.880 --> 23:21.559
Carl! It's about to start.

23:21.560 --> 23:25.559
'That's all the news.
But now, here's the weather.'

23:26.440 --> 23:29.919
Someone come and just turn it up!

23:29.920 --> 23:33.919
'..sunshine mainly in the afternoon.
Generally southeasterly breeze
with warm temperatures,

23:35.280 --> 23:38.319
'highs of 20 to 22 degrees Celsius.'

23:51.760 --> 23:55.759
'I'm delighted
the landlords have seen sense...

23:57.440 --> 24:01.439
'time more people stood up
for what they know to be right.'

24:02.160 --> 24:03.639
'Three cheers for Patty. Hip-hip!'
'Hooray!

24:03.640 --> 24:05.919
'Hip-hip!'
'Hooray!'

24:05.920 --> 24:12.999
'Hip-hip!'
'Hooray!'

24:22.600 --> 24:24.239
Hey, look, everyone. Here's Patty!

24:26.400 --> 24:30.399
We heard you on the radio, Patty.
Give her what she wants.

24:31.480 --> 24:35.479
Whisky.

24:45.680 --> 24:49.679
Again.

24:51.840 --> 24:53.439
No gratitude
for getting your mates in?

24:53.440 --> 24:56.279
A sheet of plywood and a brick?

24:56.280 --> 24:59.399
I know. Wish I'd have
thought of it earlier.

24:59.400 --> 25:00.279
And again.

25:00.280 --> 25:02.599
Patty! Come and join us.

25:02.600 --> 25:05.159
Yeah, come and have a drink.

25:05.160 --> 25:09.159
Yay! Too right,
you should go and celebrate.

25:09.320 --> 25:11.959
Children of the revolution!

25:11.960 --> 25:14.799
Chorlton nil, wheelies one,
eh, Patty?

25:14.800 --> 25:18.039
No, it's a wonderful day,
my sister of Shankly.

25:18.040 --> 25:22.039
Especially when the drinks
are on those close to you.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.239
Ha-ha-ha.

25:24.240 --> 25:26.639
Well done, Patty.

25:26.640 --> 25:28.279
Well, aren't we popular?

25:28.280 --> 25:30.239
What do you want
to keep your mouth shut?

25:30.240 --> 25:32.479
80/20 on the disability benefit.

25:32.480 --> 25:34.359
No chance.

25:34.360 --> 25:37.479
Huh... Hey, everyone! Come on!

25:37.480 --> 25:39.959
Big cheer for Patty!

25:39.960 --> 25:42.199
Yeah, party, party!

25:42.200 --> 25:43.639
Whoa! Ha-ha!

25:43.640 --> 25:46.039
Ha-ha-ha. Your call.

25:46.040 --> 25:49.879
Ha-ha.

25:49.880 --> 25:52.879
Yeah, come on! Drinks all round!

25:52.880 --> 25:56.879
Wheelies! What's your pleasure?
Come on!

26:03.480 --> 26:04.519
One...

26:04.520 --> 26:07.519
two, three, four...

26:07.520 --> 26:09.439
five... Look at that one!

26:09.440 --> 26:10.799
..six.

26:10.800 --> 26:14.799
Cheeky f...

26:15.320 --> 26:16.959
Oi! Leave it alone!

26:16.960 --> 26:18.319
Chatsworth's my patch.

26:18.320 --> 26:20.159
Yeah? It's a free market.

26:21.480 --> 26:23.919
Fucking...

26:37.480 --> 26:40.119
Come on, lads.
That's got to be worth 50 quid.

26:40.120 --> 26:43.879
Cheers, Tony. Here y'are,
do you wanna leave us your numbers?

26:43.880 --> 26:46.079
We might be able to
get you some business.

26:46.080 --> 26:48.759
That'll come in handy.

26:48.760 --> 26:52.559
No, I'm really sorry. No, I can't
make Cody's birthday party.

26:52.560 --> 26:55.439
It's very important. Sorry.

26:55.440 --> 26:58.119
No word?

26:58.120 --> 27:00.159
Maybe the filth
are playing games with us.

27:00.160 --> 27:01.279
Why would they?

27:01.280 --> 27:02.519
Because that's the sort of bullshit
they pull.

27:02.520 --> 27:05.519
Would the police fire a gun
through your mam's window?

27:05.520 --> 27:07.759
Well, somebody has,
and it's doing my head in.

27:07.760 --> 27:11.759
Silver lining. I am cutting down
on all the clowns around here.

28:01.640 --> 28:05.639
Falling down the stairs the day
before your daughter's wedding?

28:07.280 --> 28:09.239
That's right.

28:09.240 --> 28:10.239
All the way down?

28:10.240 --> 28:12.159
I needed an operation, didn't I?

28:12.160 --> 28:14.119
Impeccable timing.

28:14.120 --> 28:15.999
She was too good for him.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.999
Oh, too good for all of them
if it means leaving you.

28:20.280 --> 28:22.639
180 a week disability
is no lottery win.

28:22.640 --> 28:24.679
Hey, keeps the wolves at bay.

28:24.680 --> 28:27.079
Stop showing off. Drawing attention.

28:27.080 --> 28:29.599
People know
I can't stand the sight of you.

28:31.720 --> 28:34.999
Clean off, mate. Clean off.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.559
No...

28:36.560 --> 28:40.559
All right, boys, grab a plate.
I've made plenty.

28:44.200 --> 28:46.079
Here you go.

28:46.080 --> 28:50.079
And yours, Mimi. I just laid it all
out on a plate, didn't I?

28:50.360 --> 28:53.719
Changed man. Virtually went down
on my knees. And still she went.

28:53.720 --> 28:55.879
She always thought
she was better than she was.

28:55.880 --> 28:57.399
And then she threw it
all back in my face.

28:57.400 --> 29:00.239
I've seen women like her
all my life.

29:00.240 --> 29:02.439
She just wanted respect.

29:02.440 --> 29:05.039
She's taking us to the cleaners,
Frank.

29:05.040 --> 29:07.319
Oh, well,
she's blagged lesser men than you.

29:07.320 --> 29:10.919
Real mover and shaker.
You see where Libby got it from.

29:10.920 --> 29:13.799
Don't badmouth my daughter in public.

29:13.800 --> 29:17.799
The teeniest bit of effort, that's
all she needed to make, Lillian.

29:18.040 --> 29:20.799
Me, me, me.

29:20.800 --> 29:24.799
Why do you really think she left?

29:29.160 --> 29:31.039
You wouldn't have dared.

29:31.040 --> 29:32.959
She wanted to give it another go
with you.

29:32.960 --> 29:36.959
No matter, I begged and reminded her
you're nothing but
a useless piss-pot.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.599
So, you told her
that you could walk?

29:41.600 --> 29:44.039
Maybe I needed to come clean.

29:44.040 --> 29:45.679
Just so she'd fuck off?

29:45.680 --> 29:49.679
Unburden myself of a hateful lie.

29:50.360 --> 29:54.359
And if knowing the truth helped her
to find the strength to move on...

29:57.040 --> 30:01.039
And I've been running after you
like a busy cunt for four months?

30:03.120 --> 30:05.039
Mm.

30:05.040 --> 30:09.039
And for what it's worth,
you'll carry on.

30:09.080 --> 30:13.079
Oh?

30:13.320 --> 30:16.279
Oh.

30:16.280 --> 30:18.639
Er... excuse me! Oi, oi!

30:18.640 --> 30:21.399
Um... fellow Jockeyites! Get on this!

30:21.400 --> 30:24.919
Tss! Fwk! Christ!

30:24.920 --> 30:26.839
Don't do it!

30:26.840 --> 30:30.799
Yeeh!
Is this a blagger I see before me?

30:30.800 --> 30:34.079
Frank.

30:34.080 --> 30:38.079
You taking the piss?

30:38.720 --> 30:42.559
She can, you know.
As and when requested.

30:42.560 --> 30:45.519
Yeah, I saw her! Go on, show 'em.

30:45.520 --> 30:47.319
Rambling madman.

30:47.320 --> 30:48.479
Oh!

30:48.480 --> 30:49.599
What did you see?

30:49.600 --> 30:53.599
What did I...

30:55.120 --> 30:59.119
Ooh, listen to me on t'wireless.

30:59.720 --> 31:02.119
Oh. Tut-tut-tut!

31:02.120 --> 31:03.759
Tut!

31:03.760 --> 31:05.759
Tut-tut-tut! Splat.

31:07.440 --> 31:10.239
Do you enjoy reminding me
I'm a cripple?

31:10.240 --> 31:12.719
Now, now, Patty. Trades description.

31:12.720 --> 31:16.719
That's what I try, try,
every morning.

31:18.640 --> 31:21.159
Because I pray for a miracle
every night.

31:21.160 --> 31:25.159
And one... one time in a thousand,
I get the strength to force myself up

31:26.240 --> 31:30.239
and manage a whole second
suspended on my feet.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.119
Before...

31:35.120 --> 31:38.559
always fall back down again!

31:38.560 --> 31:40.679
Leave her alone, you bully.
She's suffered enough.

31:41.720 --> 31:42.999
Oh, you're good.

31:43.000 --> 31:43.799
Come here, you fucking fraud.

31:45.680 --> 31:47.319
Frank! Careful!

31:48.840 --> 31:50.359
No!

31:50.360 --> 31:52.239
No wonder fucking Libby left.

31:52.240 --> 31:53.319
That's enough!

31:53.320 --> 31:56.879
OK. OK, OK. Right, OK.

31:56.880 --> 31:58.639
Whoa!

31:58.640 --> 32:00.439
Frank! I'm warning you!

32:02.600 --> 32:06.599
You lying, twisted,
piss-stained old fraud!

32:07.720 --> 32:11.719
You soft-arsed bone-idle tramp.
Libby's gone for good!

32:12.600 --> 32:13.519
Frank, come on!

32:13.520 --> 32:15.359
Aah!

32:15.360 --> 32:16.439
Fuck!

32:16.440 --> 32:18.799
Help!

32:18.800 --> 32:22.439
See! See! She can feel it.
I told you!

32:22.440 --> 32:25.119
Whoa!

32:27.960 --> 32:31.119
Leave her alone!

32:31.120 --> 32:32.559
Oh!

32:32.560 --> 32:34.359
Oh, my God.

32:34.360 --> 32:35.559
Oh!

32:35.560 --> 32:37.799
Here, he's right.

32:37.800 --> 32:41.439
You...

32:41.440 --> 32:42.439
Oh!

32:42.440 --> 32:43.959
She can walk.

32:43.960 --> 32:46.039
Hallelujah!

32:46.040 --> 32:50.039
Oh, for fuck's sake.

32:51.520 --> 32:54.639
How braindead can you get?

32:54.640 --> 32:58.639
Hope it was worth it.

33:00.880 --> 33:04.039
So, what about Micky and Lillian?

33:04.040 --> 33:07.119
I haven't got the bookings
and this stuff costs a bomb to hire.

33:07.120 --> 33:09.039
It wasn't cos I was smoking weed?

33:09.040 --> 33:13.039
I'm just not ready to expand.

33:17.920 --> 33:21.919
Whatever it is, don't do it.

33:24.680 --> 33:27.599
I know she knows
I know they've got it.

33:27.600 --> 33:29.759
Maybe they haven't.
Maybe it fell through a hole.

33:29.760 --> 33:31.239
Like I wouldn't have felt it.

33:31.240 --> 33:35.239
A hole in the floor?

33:35.280 --> 33:36.319
What are you doing?

33:36.320 --> 33:37.399
You still owe me a kiss.

33:37.400 --> 33:41.399
You owe me a photo.

33:42.400 --> 33:43.799
When did you get that?

33:43.800 --> 33:45.799
Last night.
Well, send it me, then.

33:45.800 --> 33:46.919
Kiss first.

33:48.280 --> 33:50.439
Standing.

33:52.840 --> 33:54.799
Look, I've told you.
Kelly hates guns.

33:54.800 --> 33:57.519
All I'm saying is she's capable.
She lies for a living.

33:57.520 --> 33:58.559
What's that supposed to mean?

33:58.560 --> 34:00.559
She tells nonces
she loves them all day long.

34:00.560 --> 34:01.599
Karen's no angel.

34:01.600 --> 34:02.599
Well, go on.

34:02.600 --> 34:05.119
She knew you were selling guns too,
you know.

34:05.120 --> 34:07.239
Hey, she never even
goes round there.

34:07.240 --> 34:09.879
I know for a fact
Kelly did not take that gun.

34:09.880 --> 34:11.879
By my reckoning,
that only leaves you.

34:11.880 --> 34:15.879
Whoa!

34:17.199 --> 34:19.679
You gonna give your new boyfriend
a kiss?

34:19.679 --> 34:20.478
Get off me!

34:20.480 --> 34:22.199
Again. Where's the gun?

34:22.199 --> 34:23.719
I don't know what you mean!

34:23.719 --> 34:27.719
Look what we do to people.
Do you think we give a fuck
if you go in the groundas well?

34:30.679 --> 34:33.478
Have it your way.

34:35.560 --> 34:36.998
No! No, stop it!

34:37.000 --> 34:40.998
Stop! I took it home.

34:44.159 --> 34:47.079
You. You better hope
they haven't sold it.

34:47.080 --> 34:51.079
Check upstairs.

34:52.440 --> 34:56.438
Who's a lucky boy, then?

35:02.520 --> 35:05.519
Aah.

35:05.520 --> 35:09.519
So, you wanna play with fire,
do you?

35:11.200 --> 35:11.959
No!

35:47.160 --> 35:48.879
No! No!

35:48.880 --> 35:52.879
Oh! Oh!

35:57.320 --> 35:58.759
Oh!

35:58.760 --> 36:02.679
Get'em off!

36:13.240 --> 36:17.239
More! More! More!

36:17.680 --> 36:19.719
We've already done half an hour over.

36:19.720 --> 36:20.279
That's all you're getting! Get off!

36:20.280 --> 36:22.439
Get 'em off!

36:22.440 --> 36:23.839
Nobody said anything about this.

36:23.840 --> 36:25.079
Like you didn't know!

36:25.080 --> 36:26.839
Karen!
This party's over.

36:26.840 --> 36:28.919
Get the door.

36:30.200 --> 36:31.799
You're not going anywhere.

36:31.800 --> 36:32.799
Bit of a prick teaser, are we?

36:36.040 --> 36:40.039
Get it out for the lads. Yes.

36:45.560 --> 36:48.119
Hey, hey, hey, give us that!
It's his treat.

36:48.120 --> 36:49.239
Let him fuck you!

36:50.640 --> 36:52.079
Karen!

36:52.080 --> 36:54.239
Come on,
most strippers do a bit more, yeah!

36:55.880 --> 36:57.959
Do you know who I am?

36:57.960 --> 37:01.519
Some potless dirty bitch?

37:01.520 --> 37:03.159
Karen Maguire.

37:03.160 --> 37:04.919
Wit woo.

37:12.080 --> 37:15.039
Whoa! That's a big one.
Where's that going?

37:15.040 --> 37:17.879
Up your fucking ring piece,
if you're not careful!

37:24.520 --> 37:26.199
What did you do that for?

37:26.200 --> 37:28.999
Hit him as well!

37:29.000 --> 37:29.759
Get off.

37:29.760 --> 37:31.559
That's a heavy water pistol.

37:31.560 --> 37:33.919
You reckon?

37:33.920 --> 37:35.999
Ah! My leg!

37:37.040 --> 37:44.999
That's what you get,
you fucking cunts!

37:51.520 --> 37:55.519
Karen?

38:25.880 --> 38:28.519
Karen?

38:28.520 --> 38:30.319
You OK?

38:30.320 --> 38:33.519
What happened?

38:33.520 --> 38:34.639
It's all right.

38:34.640 --> 38:36.919
Come on, tell me.

38:36.920 --> 38:40.919
Just come here.

38:56.520 --> 39:00.519
Dad always said you were at it.

39:00.640 --> 39:04.559
What's up with you?

39:04.560 --> 39:07.239
Don't you dare waste that!

39:07.240 --> 39:08.559
Think you can fix things
with a full English?

39:08.560 --> 39:12.559
He's not been right for days.

39:13.640 --> 39:16.719
Hey, don't...

39:18.200 --> 39:22.199
OK, I'll take 50-50
on the disability benefits.

39:23.440 --> 39:26.559
You've got nothing on me any more.

39:26.560 --> 39:28.239
You sure about that?

39:28.240 --> 39:32.239
No chance.

39:32.880 --> 39:36.399
Well, grassing never sits easy.

39:36.400 --> 39:40.399
But DSS, like pit bulls,
get a sniff of blood.

39:40.800 --> 39:43.959
20 years of false claims?

39:43.960 --> 39:46.679
They are going to want a big chat.

39:46.680 --> 39:50.679
I'd say half each seems fair.

39:51.160 --> 39:53.319
Keep your pathetic threats, Frank.

39:53.320 --> 39:57.319
Someone's beaten you to it.

40:00.040 --> 40:04.039
Time to pack your bags.

40:04.200 --> 40:07.279
You looking at,
you fat, lazy bastard?

40:07.280 --> 40:09.439
You wouldn't be in here
if it wasn't for me.

40:09.440 --> 40:10.719
She's full of shit, her!

40:10.720 --> 40:12.599
Like I don't know it.

40:12.600 --> 40:14.359
Who backed her trip to Lourdes?

40:14.360 --> 40:18.359
Bottom line, it's down to
her you're even in here.

40:19.720 --> 40:21.039
Oh!

40:21.040 --> 40:24.479
The kid from Cincinnati, he say yes!

40:24.480 --> 40:28.479
Heh-heh-hey-hey! Who'd Adam and Eve
it, eh? The luck of the Irish.

40:29.280 --> 40:30.679
Burn the slag.

40:30.680 --> 40:33.959
I said leave it!

40:33.960 --> 40:35.559
O blest Lord, Creator God...

40:36.880 --> 40:40.839
in you all things
are rendered pure...

40:43.240 --> 40:45.719
by you are strengthened to endure.

40:45.720 --> 40:48.199
O blest holy hand of God,

40:48.200 --> 40:49.399
all things are sanctified by you...

40:50.880 --> 40:53.599
adorned, enriched,
you make them new.

40:53.600 --> 40:57.599
I'm at a funeral.

41:17.960 --> 41:19.919
Go on, Patty!

41:19.920 --> 41:21.399
Go on, girl!

41:24.200 --> 41:28.199
Go on, Patty!

41:52.120 --> 41:56.119
Squaw Valley, California, 1960.

41:57.720 --> 42:01.719
I was to be the first Irish
winter ice-dancing Olympian.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.879
Then I got pregnant with Libby.

42:06.880 --> 42:10.879
What, at 15? Fucking...
Welcome to your spiritual home.

42:11.800 --> 42:13.919
My country.

42:13.920 --> 42:16.759
The Olympics.

42:16.760 --> 42:18.719
Oh, imagine.

42:18.720 --> 42:21.559
And because you didn't get
to fuck about on ice skates

42:21.560 --> 42:23.679
it's all right to steal
your daughter's life?

42:23.680 --> 42:26.999
What was your excuse,
you useless parasite?

42:27.000 --> 42:30.199
Oh, well, yeah, you got me.
Guilty as charged.

42:30.200 --> 42:31.599
I stole Libby's heart,

42:31.600 --> 42:35.599
but you know when you're like that,
colours are brighter,
birdsong's clearer.

42:42.280 --> 42:45.439
Until the novelty fades away

42:45.440 --> 42:49.439
and I'm back in the arms
of the only constant.

42:49.640 --> 42:52.519
My only true love.

42:52.520 --> 42:56.519
Am I a lesser man?

42:57.280 --> 42:59.799
This mother-child thing?

42:59.800 --> 43:03.799
Whoosh! Nurture, shelter, protect.

43:04.480 --> 43:08.279
That's instinct, yeah?

43:08.280 --> 43:10.639
It's instinct. Natural.

43:10.640 --> 43:14.639
Then, with love and prayers,
you set them free.

43:18.600 --> 43:20.279
Too right.

43:20.280 --> 43:24.279
Amen.

43:24.360 --> 43:28.119
Just a thought.

43:28.120 --> 43:30.639
I'd booked a termination.

43:30.640 --> 43:33.239
At an underground clinic
in Liverpool.

43:33.240 --> 43:35.079
Oh, fuck off.

43:35.080 --> 43:37.239
Abortion was still illegal.

43:37.240 --> 43:40.479
Now you need to button it.

43:40.480 --> 43:44.479
But the worst storm in a decade
stopped the ferries for a week.

43:44.800 --> 43:48.799
Daddy found out, locked me
in my room for a month.

43:49.880 --> 43:53.879
I wanted to get rid of her then...

43:54.440 --> 43:58.439
and I don't need her now.

43:58.480 --> 44:02.479
Well, I hope it was worth it.

44:03.360 --> 44:05.519
I don't need anybody.

44:20.000 --> 44:23.999
'At what point does
withholding the truth become a lie?

44:24.840 --> 44:28.839
'I bet politicians are given books
to guide them on that.

44:29.320 --> 44:33.319
'At what point in the lie you've just
created is it too late to back out

44:35.240 --> 44:39.239
'and telling the truth
would do more damage?

44:39.680 --> 44:41.239
'When you have to keep it going

44:41.240 --> 44:45.239
'because you know that even if you
manage to keep that lie going
forever,

44:46.440 --> 44:50.439
'it will eat you up so much inside
you won't want to live anyway.'

44:55.960 --> 44:58.879
Home deliveries. Good idea. I've got
a bit of stock needs shifting.

44:58.880 --> 45:00.759
I don't want to get involved
in any illegal shit.

45:00.760 --> 45:02.999
Let your driver take the flack.

45:03.000 --> 45:04.519
Not over, is it?
Between you and the running man?

45:04.520 --> 45:06.439
We've been acting out our fantasies.

45:06.440 --> 45:08.399
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

45:08.400 --> 45:10.079
Mm.

45:10.080 --> 45:12.479
Like butter wouldn't melt.
Police just pulled me.

45:12.480 --> 45:15.399
Luckily, I hid that lot
somewhere else.

45:15.400 --> 45:17.399
Avril, we need to talk.

45:17.400 --> 45:19.159
You arrogant piece of shit!

45:19.160 --> 45:20.599
Morning!
Hiya!

45:20.600 --> 45:21.879
Ring the police, Ches.

45:21.880 --> 45:24.079
Tell them about your paedo tendencies
while you're at it.

45:24.080 --> 45:25.639
D'you want some sex?

45:25.640 --> 45:29.639
You were seen kissing her.

45:29.840 --> 45:32.159
I knows my place, master.

45:32.760 --> 45:34.700
Aah!
